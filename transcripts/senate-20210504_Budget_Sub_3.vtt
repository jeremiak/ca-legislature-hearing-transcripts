YOUTH IN AB ELEVEN THIRTY AND

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:16.693
THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRAILER

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.161
BILL ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:19.930
PATHWAY FOR CURBING THE RISING

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:21.932
COST OF HEALTHCARE. WE BELIEVE

THERE ARE CRITICAL CHANGES

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:25.002

QUESTIONS WHEN APPROPRIATE.

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:38.548
FIRST I SUPPOSE WE ARE

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:39.483
CONCERNED THAT THERE COULD BE

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:40.917
DETRIMENTAL AND UNINTENDED

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:42.619
CONSEQUENCES FOR EXAMPLE THIS

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:43.553
BILL SUGGESTS THAT THE

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.622
HEALTHCARE SPENDING TODAY. IS

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:47.090
IN THE RIGHT AMOUNTS IN IS IN

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:49.459
THE RIGHT PLACES. AS MANY

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.061
KNOWLEDGE CODE NINETEEN HAS

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:52.729
SHOWN THAT CURRENT SPENDING ON

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.231
BEHAVIOR HEALTH IS INSUFFICIENT

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.966
FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS.

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.634
IN FACT THIS IS ALSO THE

00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:59.269
ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION AS

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:00.070
WE'VE SEEN THEIR BUDGET

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:02.372
PROPOSAL. TO INVEST MORE THAN

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:03.774
ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF BEHAVIOR

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.978
HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND.

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:08.779
STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:09.313
UNDER THE SUPER BOWL THESE

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:10.080
TYPES OF INVEST WOULD OWN BE

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:11.481
IMPLEMENTED IF OTHER SPENDING

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:13.183
IS REDUCED FORCING A CHOICE

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.419
BETWEEN NEW BENEFICIAL SPENDING

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:17.654
AND CUTS TO EXISTING SERVICES.

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:18.955
SECOND WE WERE ASKED TO

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:20.957
CONSIDER OTHER MODELS WELL

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:22.259
WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR WELL

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:24.061
INTENTIONED POLICY LEAD TO

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:25.329
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES UNDER

COURSE WE HAVE IS NOT HAVING

RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO CONTROL

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:28.023
COSTS. BY PUTTING ADDITIONAL

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.524
PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM SUCH

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.091
INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE AND

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.393
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND THAT

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:06.695
THAT INVESTMENT IN TURN HELPS

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:08.530
BRING DOWN COSTS AND SO WE

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:10.299
WOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT- ON A

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:12.534
REGIONAL BASIS JUST TRY TO

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:13.568
ADDRESS EXACTLY THE QUESTION

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:17.272

FEW QUESTIONS. PRECIADO THAT'S-

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:32.888
AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:37.859
PRESENTATION- AND- I GUESS I

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:40.362
WOULD JUST FIRST OF ALL- START

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.229
OFF BY SAYING YOU KNOW MY

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:42.564
CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THAT

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.599
I'M A PHYSICIAN. AND I TAKE

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:46.568
YOUR PEOPLE UNDER SEC- I ALSO

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:47.936
TRIED PREVENT DISEASES WELL

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.304
EFFECTIVE FEATURES AND THAT'S

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:50.505
WHAT SPEND MOST MY TIME BUT

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:52.441
ALSO KNOWLEDGE THAT PROBABLY

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.076
FROM SPENDING POINT OF VIEW IF

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:56.378
THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY- HAVE

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.780
HEALTH CARE NEEDS. IN FACT-

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:00.349
LET'S REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:03.285
CHRONIC DISEASE- SPEND ABOUT

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:05.854
7080% OF HEALTHCARE COSTS-

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:06.955
THERE ABOUT 40% OF

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.957
CALIFORNIANS- SO AS WE TRY TO

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:10.592
CAP OFF COSTS JUST KEEP IN MIND

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.661
WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT. IN FACT

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.730
THE SICKEST 10% SPEND ABOUT TWO

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:15.497
THIRDS OF ALL HEALTH CARE

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:19.301
SPENDING SO- SO JUST BEGAN A

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:21.770
REMINDER OF WHO WERE IMPACTING-

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:23.505
AND THEIR ACCESS TO CARE AS

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:25.173
WELL. I ALSO THINK IT'S

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.042
INTERESTING I DO NOTE THAT INTO

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:29.544
TESTIMONY- WE TALKED A LITTLE

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:32.681
BIT ABOUT- MEDICARE AND SOME OF

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:34.416
THE CHALLENGES THAT MEDICARE'S

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.551
FACED- IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.820
PAYMENT- THE SVR WHO WAS A

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:40.489
FAILED ATTEMPT BY CONGRESS TO

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:43.692
TIE. PAYMENTS TO- ESSENTIALLY

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:46.695
THE G. P. AND- OVER SEVERAL

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:47.996
YEARS IN FACT OVER MORE IN A

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.765
DECADE THAT BECAME A DISASTER

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.333
AND FINALLY CONGRESS HAD TO

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.102
STEP IN AND FIX THAT- BECAUSE

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:55.704
IT WAS IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.105
TO QUOTE PEAK YOU KNOW THINGS

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.840
MORE AFFORDABLE OR TO. LIMIT

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:00.842
SPENDING BUT BECAUSE IT IN

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.577
ACTUALLY TIED IT TO AND

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:04.179
ECONOMIC DATA MARKER THAT WAS

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.747
NOT RELATED TO ACTUAL HEALTH

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:08.283
CARE NEEDS IT CERTAINLY CAUSED

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.651
ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS THE OTHER

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:11.286
THING ACTUALLY APPROVE APROPOS

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:13.388
WAS IS REGARDING- PAYMENT

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:15.257
RATES. AS WELL FOR DIFFERENT

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:17.292
REGIONS- AND MEDICARE ACTUALLY

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.527
THE ESTABLISHED REGIONS WHEN

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:19.628
MEDICARE WAS ESTABLISHED

01:18:19.694 --> 01:18:21.196
ANSWERS ENOUGH SACRAMENTO AT

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:22.697
THE TIME I KNOW SOME PEOPLE

01:18:22.764 --> 01:18:23.832
CALL US A COW TOWN IT'LL THE

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:25.667
CORE CAL TOWN BUT- YOU KNOW WE

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:27.269
WILL CONSIDER RULE ACTUALLY

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:29.071
WHEN MEDICARE WAS ESTABLISHED.

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:31.873
IN FACT- THE PROBLEM WAS IS

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.508
THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:35.544
FOR AREAS LIKE SACRAMENTO EVEN

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.079
THOSE WE BECAME MORE URBANIZED

01:18:37.145 --> 01:18:42.217
AND- AND ACTUALLY COSTS A

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:42.818
PRACTICE WENT UP WE WERE STILL

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:43.852
REIMBURSE. WISE FOR MEDICARE TO

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:45.854
BEING- SAY AS THE OTHER

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:47.622
COMMUNITIES THAT DIDN'T REFLECT

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:49.691
OUR THE COST OF A PRACTICE SO.

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:50.792
AGAIN I THINK REGIONAL

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:51.860
ADJUSTMENTS ARE GONNA BE

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:53.128
IMPORTANT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:54.429
REFLECT THIS AND I APPRECIATE

01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:56.698
THE CHAIR BRING OUT- ISSUE THAT

01:18:56.765 --> 01:18:57.833
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

01:18:57.899 --> 01:18:59.434
SOMEONE HAS SOME COST ANALYSIS

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:01.336
AS- YEAH RULED PRACTICES. WHAT

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:03.672
CHEAPER BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THE

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:05.474
ONLY YEAH. THAT RENTAL COSTS

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.775
OTHER TYPES OF EXPENSES ARE ARE

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:08.577
PERHAPS LESS BUT THEN THAT

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:09.744
BECOMES A DISINCENTIVE FOR

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.213
PEOPLE TEND TO GO INTO

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:14.015
PRACTICE. IN THIS AREA SO. THAT

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:15.417
WILL BE HAVE TO BE MONITORED

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:18.120
CAREFULLY- BUT I GUESS THE

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:19.621
FIRST QUESTION I HAVE AND I

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:21.123

EFFORTS- TO NOT UNNECESSARILY

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:27.181
DUPLICATE SO I KNOW THE NEXT

01:26:27.248 --> 01:26:28.182
ITEM YOU'RE HEARING IS ABOUT

01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:30.385
THE NHC'S PROPOSAL IS THAT

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:32.687
QUALITY AND EQUITY METRICS WE

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:34.422
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:35.557
EFFORTS UNDERWAY WITH MEDIC

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:36.758
CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA WITH

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:39.027
HEALTH FIRST. SO WE WILL HAVE A

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:40.929
SUBSET OF OUR STAFF- AND

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.730
RESEARCHERS THAT ARE LOOKING AT

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:45.567
US SAID OF QUALITY DATA- AGAIN

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:48.703
WANTING TO LEVERAGE EXISTING-

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:52.407
SELECTED. OF MEASURES BUT WE

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:54.242
NEED TO HAVE THOSE IN PLACE SO

01:26:54.309 --> 01:26:55.443
THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:56.644
QUALITY IS NOT NEGATIVELY

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.947
IMPACTED OKAY AS WE OPPOSE THE

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:00.615
PAST ARE NO I AM AND I

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:02.317
APPRECIATE THAT I THINK ONE NO

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:03.985
TO SOMEONE WHO'S ALSO DONE

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:04.419
RESEARCH IN QUALITY

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:07.188
IMPROVEMENT- IS THAT. QUALITY

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:08.723
DATA IS OF COURSE MOST USUALLY

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:11.159
AVAILABLE AND DISEASES THAT ARE

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:13.928
FAIRLY WIDESPREAD- THAT THERE'S

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.530
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT.

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:16.798
CERTAINLY IT'S A LOT EASIER TO

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:17.599
COLLECT THE GETS MORE

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.000
CHALLENGING WE TALK ABOUT RARE

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.469
CONDITIONS FUND US THEY'RE JUST

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:22.036
MUCH SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:27.575
PEOPLE- THAT- THERE- AND SO FOR

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:30.144
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT NCQA

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:32.547
OR YOU LOOK AT HE TO YOU KNOW

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:33.848
THE IS VERY STATUS AT C.

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:35.450
DISCOURSE BASED ON MINISTRY OF

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:40.455
DATA- YOU KNOW IT'S- WELL

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:41.089
CERTAINLY THE- CAN BE. HELPFUL

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:42.323
AND YOU LOOK AT THE LIKE. OR

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:44.292
DIABETES USUALLY HAVE LIKE AND

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:45.526
LARGE NUMBERS WHEN YOU START

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:47.128
TALKING TO SMALLER NUMBERS.

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:48.296
ALTHOUGH HUMILIATE ALL THE

01:27:48.363 --> 01:27:49.631
SMALL OF THE SMALL NUMBER

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:51.466
CONDITIONS ALTOGETHER IT'S ARE

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:52.033
ACTUALLY STARTS TO BECOME A

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.702
FAIRLY LARGE NMBER- BUT THE

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:55.536
QUALITY DATA IS MUCH MORE

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:57.405
CHALLENGING. AND THE SOMEONE

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:58.439
WHO'S ACTUALLY BEEN INVOLVED

01:27:58.506 --> 01:28:00.375
IN- DOING QUALITY DATA

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.410
ANALYSIS. I THINK HOPEFULLY IS

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:03.511
THAT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:05.346
BE KNOWLEDGE TO FIGHT AND IT

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:06.648
DIDN'T AND THE STUDIES OF THE

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:07.582
TASK FORCE IS THAT WE'RE NOT

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:10.385
OVERLY FOCUS JUST ON THE-

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:12.620
CONDITIONS THAT. THAT OBVIOUSLY

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:14.222
THEY DO HAVE A LARGER IMPACT.

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:15.790
ON ON SPENDING BUT THE OTHER

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:18.893
ONE'S HUMILITY. ALSO HAVE A

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.262
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SPENDING.

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:22.430
YES THERE IS A THIS IS ALWAYS

01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:23.531
THE HEARING YOU HAVE A LOT OF

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.266
IMPORTANT EXPERTISE AND SO WE

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:26.567
DO PLAN TO BRING IT YOU KNOW

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:29.003
WORK OFF OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:30.571
MODELS AND SO I THINK YOUR

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:32.306
POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN THAT-

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:33.207
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:34.976
WIDESPREAD DISEASES LIKE LIKE

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:35.910
DIABETES AND OTHER CHRONIC

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.578
CONDITIONS AS WELL AS- THERE'S

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:39.113
LESS FREQUENT BUT BUT VERY

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.082
IMPACTFUL. LOCATIONS AS WELL SO

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.216
I JUST MAKE NOTE THAT THERE MAY

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:44.385
NOT BE DATA AT YOU KNOW THERE

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:46.654
THERE MAY BE DATA VOIGTS OKAY

01:28:46.721 --> 01:28:47.889
BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S HARD TO

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:49.824
COLLECTED ON THESE. SMALL

01:28:49.891 --> 01:28:51.526
CONDITIONS I'M NOT SAYING THAT-

01:28:51.592 --> 01:28:53.161
AND I THINK SO YOU NEED TO BE

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:54.495
SURE THERE'S ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY

01:28:54.562 --> 01:28:55.697
TO DEAL WITH THE DATA VOID

01:28:55.763 --> 01:28:57.265
ISSUE- THAT YOU DON'T SIMPLY

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:58.232
SAY HELP BECAUSE THERE'S NO

01:28:58.299 --> 01:29:00.301
DATA THEREFORE WE DON'T HAVE

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:02.870
TO. ARE WE YOU KNOW THE

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.539
EXPANDING PART- YOU'D BE

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:05.873
BASICALLY I THOUGHT U. ZERO

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:08.509
ALTO OR- OR UNDERESTIMATE SO I

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:09.744
JUST WANNA POINT THAT OUT AND

01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:14.716
THEN CERTAINLY EQUITY WHICH I.

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:15.616
KNOW WILL HERE FROM THE NDC.

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:16.184
THE I OFTENTIMES SOME ISSUE

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:17.385
HARM PLACE BECAUSE- THE VERY

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:18.720
SAME PEOPLE WHO HAVE LESS

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:19.587
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:21.289
OFTENTIMES HAVE LESS ACCESS TO

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:22.323
PEOPLE ACTUALLY STUDY HOW WELL

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.325
THEY'RE DOING. UNFORTUNATELY

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:26.494
AND- SO. AGAIN EQUITY

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:27.829
FRAMEWORK. I THINK IT'S

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:29.464
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE SO. I

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:30.698
WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT AS A

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.400
SOMEONE WHO IS- ASIAN. TO

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:34.035
REPLICATE CHAIRS THE ATI CAUCUS

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:36.437
AND- IT IS- ASIAN THAT-

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:38.239
ACTUALLY I THINK ONLY IS VERY

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:39.574
SMALL FRACTION OF STUDIES HAVE

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.775
YOU GO LOOK AT THE LITERATURE

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:42.376
PUBLISHED LITERATURE. ACTUALLY

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:46.013
INCLUDE ATI IS A CATEGORY THAT

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:46.948
THEY STUDIED. WE'RE USUALLY NOT

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:49.717
THERE. WE DON'T EXIST. AND YET

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:51.052
OUR COMMUNITY WHICH REPRESENTS

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:52.987
60% OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GONNA

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.422
BE COUNTING ON YOU TO NOT TO

01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:56.157
MAKE US DISAPPEAR. EVEN THOUGH

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.926
THE RESEARCH DATA ISN'T THERE

01:29:58.993 --> 01:30:00.728
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T STUDIES.

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:02.363
AND I HOPE I CAN COUNT ON YOU

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:04.398
TO NOT DO THAT TO US. LOU THANK

01:30:04.465 --> 01:30:06.267
YOU FOR FLAGGING OUT OF. SELF

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:08.636
AGAIN AS A DATA VOIGTS RIGHT.

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:10.638
NOW THE OTHER ISSUE I ACTUALLY

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:12.707
WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IS- THE

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:14.575
ADVISORY BOARD AND IT WAS

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:16.577
BROUGHT UP BUT- WHAT. HE'D

01:30:16.644 --> 01:30:19.147
SPEAK TO THE INDEPENDENCE OF

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:22.150
THE ADVISORY BOARD TO YOU KNOW

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:23.518
I'M I'M ELECTED OFFICIAL SAYS

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.486
ONLY RESPONSIBLE TO VOTERS AND

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:26.120
I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE NEED TO

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:28.156
BE ACCOUNTABLE- BUT WE ALSO

01:30:28.222 --> 01:30:29.423
THINK THAT THERE'S SOME

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:30.958
ARGUMENT THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:34.162
OVERLY- INFLUENCED BY POLITICAL

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:34.796
AND FOR THE ADDRESS WITH

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.164
BASICALLY SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY.

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:38.266
EVIDENCE AND DATA SO CAN YOU

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:39.500
SPEAK TO WHAT IS THE

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:40.835
INDEPENDENCE OF THE ADVISORY

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:43.171
BOARD FROM LET'S SAY THE

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:44.772
GOVERNOR OR OTHER ELECTED-

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:48.276
BODIES. CERTAINLY CENTER PAINS

01:30:48.342 --> 01:30:49.610
OF THE CURRENT- PROPOSED

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:51.913
STRUCTURE THAT WE PUT FORWARD

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:54.115
DOES HAVE THE ADVISORY BOARD

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.183
BEING PRIMARILY APPOINTED BY

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:56.350
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:58.252
SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY WITH US

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:01.289
A FEW EX OFFICIO. MEMBER ON THE

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:03.224
FX TERMS WHERE THEY CANNOT FEED

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.125
THAT DID ARE THEY SERVING AT

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:06.227
WILL OR THE- ACTUALLY ONCE ARE

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:08.596
POINTED THEY- HAVE SUFFICIENT

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:10.198
TERMS IN THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:12.934
TO. DISMISSAL UNLESS OBVIOUSLY

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.435
IF THEY COMPASSIONATE TO COMMIT

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:15.937
SOME EGREGIOUS ACT OR SOMETHING

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:16.971
SO IS THERE DEBT LEVEL OF

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:18.539
INDEPENDENCE. I BELIEVE THERE

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:20.875
ARE FIXED TERMS YES OKAY ALL

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.310
RIGHT I WOULD CERTAINLY AGAIN

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:24.212
WHAT IS POLICY THINGS I WOULD

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:25.580
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:27.281
ABOUT. AND THEN THAT DID COME

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:29.183
UP WITH THE F. DEFINITION OF A

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.686
PROVIDER AND AGAIN I HAVEN'T

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:36.624
SEEN THE SPECIFICS- SO- AND IT

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.226
WAS MEN. BY CMA. THAT FOR

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:40.428
EXAMPLE A SOLO PRACTICE DOCTOR

01:31:40.494 --> 01:31:43.197
WOULD BE CONSIDERED A PROVIDER-

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:45.166
IT IS SOAKING FIRST OF ALL CAN

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:46.500
YOU TELL ME THAT'S TRUE AND

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:47.602
THEN LET'S SEE A DENTIST IS A

01:31:47.668 --> 01:31:49.070
DENTIST A PROVIDER UNDER JUST

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:50.037
DEFINITIONS THAT WOULD FALL

01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:51.973
UNDER THE SAME THING. AND THEN

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:53.107
FINALLY A CHIROPRACTOR WITH

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:54.442
THEY ALSO FALL UNDER THE

01:31:54.508 --> 01:31:56.777
DEFINITION AS WELL. SO AN YOU

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:59.080
SELL INDIVIDUAL SOLO PRACTICE

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:01.616
PHYSICIAN INDEPENDENT PRACTICE.

01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:05.319
DENTIST AND THE CNTRACTOR. BUT

01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:06.921
ALSO UNDER THE PHOENICIAN. YOUR

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:07.555
LAST POINT I JUST WANT TO

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:09.257
CLARIFY THE YES THE LITTLE

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:10.591
ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS WOULD

SERVE- FOR FOUR YEARS SO WANTED

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:14.562
TO PUT THAT OUT THERE IN TERMS

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:15.396
OF WHETHER A SINGLE

01:32:15.463 --> 01:32:17.598
PRACTITIONER WOULD. BE SUBJECT

01:32:17.665 --> 01:32:19.767
TO THE COST TARGET- NO THEY

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:22.870
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT- THE BILL

THAT WE ARE RELEASED IN. THE

01:32:25.273 --> 01:32:26.073
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OF THE

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.708
MEASURES RELEASED IN EARLY

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:29.310
FEBRUARY LEAVES OPEN THE

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:30.945
DEFINITION OF A HEALTH CARE

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:32.213
ENTITY THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.748
COST TARGET WE WILL LEAVE THAT

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:35.616
UP TO REGULATIONS- WE

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:37.018
UNDERSTAND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.219
TO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:39.654
ASSOCIATION. THERE'S THAT THAT

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.623
DEFINITION B. B. SEVEN STATURE

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:43.858
IS ARE WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:32:43.925 --> 01:32:46.160
WORKING- ON WHAT THE NUMBER HOW

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:47.461
LARGER PRACTICE SHOULD BE

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:49.530
INCLUDED. IN THAT DEFINITION OF

01:32:49.597 --> 01:32:51.332
HEALTH CARE ENTITY. OKAY AND

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:54.902
THEN AND THEN- SO. SO THAT SEEM

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:58.873

LARGE YOU HAVEN'T HAVE LARGE

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:07.949
GROUPERS LARGE GROUPS OF THOSE

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:09.784
ENTITIES AS WELL. YEAH I DO NOT

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.085
BELIEVE WE PLAN TO INCLUDE

DENTISTS- AND WE AGAIN WILL

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:15.156

THE LINES OF BUSINESS WILL BE

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:27.568
IDENTIFIED I DON'T. THE H. P.

01:33:27.635 --> 01:33:29.570
FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE CHOSEN NOT TO

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:31.806
START DOCUMENTS- DENTISTRY- AT

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:34.542
THE OUTSET- AND NOR NOR

01:33:34.608 --> 01:33:38.579
CHIROPRACTORS. OKAY AND- AND

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:39.747
THAT WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:40.848
BILLIONS ARE SPENT IN

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:47.154
ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE. EXPENSES

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:49.023
IS THAT GOING TO BE ALSO UNDER

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:51.625
THE OVERSIGHT OF THIS- OF THIS

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:54.762
BODY- THAT IS A SUBSTANTIAL.

01:33:54.829 --> 01:33:57.631
PORTION OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING.

01:33:57.698 --> 01:33:59.667
I'M CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION OF

01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:01.402
THE TOTAL COST OF CARE DOESN'T

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:03.804
INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE OF

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.039
SOMETHING THAT A CONSUMER CHOSE

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:07.441
TO SPEND ON THEIR OWN OUTSIDE

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:08.576
OF THEIR HOME OKAY REYES SAYS

01:34:08.642 --> 01:34:09.844
IT'S OUTSIDE HEALTH COVERAGE SO

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.846
THEREFORE FOR EXAMPLE CONCIERGE

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:14.015
PRACTICES WOULD NOT FALL UNDER

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:17.018
THIS. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:18.986
I'M HAPPY FOR MY FAILURE OR

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:20.254
WRITE ABOUT THE TO CORRECTLY I

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:21.756
DON'T THINK WE'VE REACHED THAT

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:24.225
LEVEL OF DETAIL OKAY SO AND

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:26.127
THEN I GUESS AND I REALIZE

01:34:26.193 --> 01:34:28.496
THAT. BUT THEN WE STARTING TO

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:32.266
EQUITY ISSUE. RIGHT AFTER ALL

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:33.601
WHO CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES IN

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:34.635
OTHER WORDS WE'RE GOING TO BE A

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:35.736
SYSTEM WHERE WE SAY GUESS WHAT

01:34:35.803 --> 01:34:37.438
IF YOU'RE NOT RICHARD RICH

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:39.040
ENOUGH YOU CAN BUY OUT IF

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:41.008
YOU'RE NOT RICH ENOUGH YOU'RE

01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:45.212
STUCK UNDER A CAPS. CORRECT

01:34:45.279 --> 01:34:47.515
WELL CONCIERGE PAYMENTS ARE

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:48.983
ABOVE AND BEYOND THE USUAL

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:53.387
COPAYS- OKAY LIKE THAT AGAIN I

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:54.755
JUST POSE THAT OUT THERE TO

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:57.124
THINK ABOUT OKAY SO YEAH WE'RE

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:58.626
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEING ABLE

01:34:58.692 --> 01:34:59.994
TO BUY THEMSELVES OUT.

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:02.229
ESSENTIALLY OKAY- THE OTHER

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:06.233
ISSUE IS THAT- SO IN TERMS OF

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.203
THAT OTHER INPUTS- THIS PEOPLE

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.238
ARE DEVELOPING THESE COST

01:35:11.305 --> 01:35:13.474
TARGETS. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. A

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:14.575
YEAH AND YOU KNOW THE ADVISORY

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:16.343
COMMITTEE WE KNOW THAT ONE

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:18.345
DRIVER HEALTHCARE COSTS THIS

01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:18.913
TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE CHANGING

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.981
TECHNOLOGY. ANOTHER ONE IS FOR

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:22.450
EXAMPLE NEW DISEASES HAVING

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:23.751
CERTAINLY THAT HOPEFULLY IS

01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:25.219
QUITE EVIDENT TO ANYONE RIGHT

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:27.188
NOW AS WE ARE FACING COVET AND

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:29.190
CORONAVIRUS. YOU KNOW IT HIV

BEFORE AND SO FORTH- HOW AND

01:35:32.993 --> 01:35:35.062
THEN IT SO HOW HOW DO YOU SEE

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:36.864
THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MAKING

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:39.066
ADJUSTMENTS WHEN YOU HAVE- AND

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:40.367
PROJECT YET AND EVENTUALLY I

01:35:40.434 --> 01:35:41.569
DID WORKFORCE PROJECTIONS

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:44.371
BEFORE IN MY- PREVIOUS RESEARCH

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:44.905
AS A THE FOR KIND OF THE

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:47.875
LEGISLATURE- SO. OFTEN TIMES

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:49.410
AGAIN THESE ARE PLACES WHERE

01:35:49.477 --> 01:35:50.778
YOU'RE YOU'RE PLAYING YOU KNOW

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:53.547
BEST PLANS GO AWRY. BUT IF YOU

01:35:53.614 --> 01:35:55.182
DON'T DO THINGS RIGHT THEN YOU

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:56.517
SUDDENLY SAY GUESS WHAT WE

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.319
DON'T NEED MORE ID DOCTORS AND

01:35:58.385 --> 01:36:00.221
THEN HIV STARTS SHOWING UP AND

01:36:00.287 --> 01:36:01.589
WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THAT HAS

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:04.558
ON. ON POPULATIONS. SO HOW HOW

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:06.994
WE ACCOUNT FOR TECHNOLOGY WHICH

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:08.462
IS MAYBE SOMEWHAT LOW MORE

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:10.531
PREDICTABLE AND YOU DISEASES

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:11.532
AND TRYING TO PROJECT AND

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:13.200
TRYING TO ESTABLISH THESE KIND

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:14.635
OF SPENDING TARGETS TO BE SURE

01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:16.937
THAT WE DON'T DENY CARE. OR

01:36:17.004 --> 01:36:19.373
UNDER RESOURCE CARE FOR

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:19.940
POPULATIONS ANY PARTICULAR

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:25.045
VULNERABLE. TO THESE CONDITIONS.

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:26.747
YES ARE NONE SO IT IS REASONWERE INTEREST IN COLLECT THE

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:29.049
DATA ON CURRENT. YEAR IS- AT

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.818
SOME POINT OF COMPARISON WHO

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:33.254
KNOWS- WHAT WHAT WILL BE COMING

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.788
OUR WAY SO WE THINK THAT WILL

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:36.323
BE IMPORTANT BASELINE DATA AS

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:38.559
WELL AS TO HOPEFULLY HAVE- IF

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:39.994
WE IF WE GET BACK TO A NEW

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.029
NORMAL IN TWENTY TWENTY TO

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:42.663
TWENTY TWENTY THREE HAVE. HAVE

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.965
THAT BASELINE DATA- WE

01:36:45.032 --> 01:36:46.867
CERTAINLY THINK THERE WILL BE.

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:48.369
IT WOULD WE WOULD. I THINK IT'S

01:36:48.435 --> 01:36:50.137
IMPORTANT AS THE ADVISORY BOARD

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:52.273
LOOKS TO SET THE COST TARGET TO

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:54.008
ALLOW FOR THE INCREASE

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:55.876
HOPEFULLY IS GOING TO EXACTLY

01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:58.112
WHAT WE WANTED TO GO TO- IT

01:36:58.179 --> 01:36:59.146
WOULD ACTUALLY IMPROVE CARE

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:01.949
WHICH WOULD BE- IT. A VALUABLE

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:04.251
INNOVATIONS AS WELL AS A-

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:06.320
INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGYSO ONE

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:08.189
OF THE PIECES THAT THE- OFFICE

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:09.356
WILL ALSO BE DOING IS TRYING TO

01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:10.791
PROMOTE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:13.194
METHODS- WE THINK THOSE ARE

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.995
IMPORTANT VEHICLES. TO HELP.

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:18.165
INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENTS- IN IN

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:20.000
TECHNOLOGY AND THEN THE MOST

01:37:20.067 --> 01:37:21.869
INNOVATIVE EFFECTIVE. MEDICAL

01:37:21.936 --> 01:37:24.171
STRATEGIES. OKAY I APPRECIATE

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:25.039
THAT I KNOW SHE SAID THE WORD

01:37:25.105 --> 01:37:27.007
HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY IS A LITTLE

01:37:27.074 --> 01:37:29.677
SCARY BECAUSE HOPEFULLY. I

01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:30.844
THINK WE NEED TO PLAN FOR THIS

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:32.413
WE NEED TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:34.181
ANTICIPATE FOR THIS THIS WE

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:35.316
NEED TO ENSURE THAT ADVISE YOU

01:37:35.382 --> 01:37:37.351
COMMITTEES RESPONSES. TO THIS

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:38.652
THAT THEY DON'T TO AT IT OR NOT

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:40.387
AND NOT NOT UNRESPONSIVE TO

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:41.388
THIS SO HOPEFULLY IT'S MORE

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:43.090
THAN. HOPEFULLY SO I SAID

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:45.025
HOPEFULLY BECAUSE- THEY DíAS

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:46.994
TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD INSIST.

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:49.930
THAT WE ARE CORRECT FOR THIS-

01:37:49.997 --> 01:37:51.131
AND THEN CERTAINLY ONE PART

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:52.399
THAT SHOULD BE VERY PREDICTABLE

01:37:52.466 --> 01:37:54.401
AS THE AGING POPULATION AND

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:56.503
INCREASING DEMAND FOR THAT SO.

01:37:56.570 --> 01:38:01.075
AS. WE LOOK AT HEALTH- IT'S- I

01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:02.509
MEAN THAT'S ONE RE WHY. IS

01:38:02.576 --> 01:38:04.612
GOING TO BE FASTER INFLATION

01:38:04.678 --> 01:38:05.512
BECAUSE THE POPULATION IS NOT

01:38:05.579 --> 01:38:06.947
GONNA BE THE SAME NEXT YEAR

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:08.449
IT'S A YEAR OLDER AND WELL YES

01:38:08.515 --> 01:38:10.150
WE DO HAVE PEOPLE DYING AT ONE

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:11.218
END AND PEOPLE BEING BORED THE

01:38:11.285 --> 01:38:13.287
OTHER. WE KNOW THAT THE OVERALL

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:15.022
AGE AVERAGE AGE OF OUR

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:17.458
POPULATION IS INCREASING. OVER

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:19.960
A OVER TIME AND THAT- AND THAT

01:38:20.027 --> 01:38:22.463
IS THEY'RE DOING THAT THE COSTS

01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:24.832
TARGETS. AT THAT WE NEED TO

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:26.133
JUST WITHOUT GIVING ANY NOTICE

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.401
AYE AYE HE HEARD THE TESTIMONY

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:28.535
AND THAT'S IT I KNOW IT'S

01:38:28.602 --> 01:38:30.437
COMMONLY SAID THAT- WE ALWAYS

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:32.172
SPEND 30% HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE

01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:35.576
NECESSARY- BUT I WOULD BE NO

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:36.443
STATUS IN MY CONVERSATIONS

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:40.314
WITH- PREVIOUS SECRETARY DULY-

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:41.582
AT. THE CHALLENGES FINDING

01:38:41.649 --> 01:38:44.184
WHICH 30% RIGHT I MEAN WHEN YOU

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:44.918
ACTUALLY START LOOKING

01:38:44.985 --> 01:38:46.353
INDIVIDUAL CASES I KNOW IT'S

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.622
COMMONLY THROWN OUT THERE. BUT

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:49.757
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE STUDY WHICH

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:50.924
ACTUALLY THEN THEY'LL SAY OKAY

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:52.693
HERE'S THE 30% OF THE WASTEFUL

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.795
PART. RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:55.929
PUSH COMES TO SHOVE AND EOPLE

01:38:55.996 --> 01:38:58.065
TRY TO FIND IT IT'S NOT SO EASY

01:38:58.132 --> 01:39:00.734
TO FIND. AND THEN. THE OTHER

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:01.435
THING IS THE OTHER QUESTION

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:02.736
YOU'VE MADE SOME REFERENCE TO

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:06.740
THIS OKAY SO. LABOR COSTS- WE

01:39:06.807 --> 01:39:08.842
KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE AND

01:39:08.909 --> 01:39:10.911
HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY AGAIN.

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:13.447
REPRESENTED BY THE UNIONS WHICH

01:39:13.514 --> 01:39:14.915
IS A GOOD THING I MYSELF AM A

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:18.852
MEMBER OF THE LABOR UNIONS- SO

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:21.088
ARE WE ARE SO IF AN ENTITY

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:21.822
ACTUALLY HAS A COLLECTIVE

01:39:21.889 --> 01:39:23.857
BARGAINING AGREEMENT. AND THAT

01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:25.426
LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN WAGES

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:27.494
AND BENEFITS. THAT

01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:29.129
AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE THEIR

01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:30.731
COST TARGET REFLECTOR INCREASE

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.766
IN LABOR EXPENSES ESPECIALLY

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:36.537
SINCE 60% OF HEALTHCARE IS

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:38.539
LABOR. SO WE THERE IS OF

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:41.542
CURRENTLY LANGUAGE AND ASSEMBLY

01:39:41.608 --> 01:39:43.644
MEMBER WOODS BILL THAT LOOKS

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:46.313
TO- HAVING TO RECOGNIZE A

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.216
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CHANGES

01:39:49.283 --> 01:39:51.118
AS AS AN INPUT TO BE CONSIDERED.

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:53.620
JUST TO BE CONSIDERED WELL AS

01:39:53.687 --> 01:39:55.055
AS AN ECONOMIC INDICATOR AS

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:57.257
PART OF THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:59.393
THAT'S DONE OKAY- EVALUATE THE

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:02.696
COST ARGUE. OKAY SO- I JUST

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.732
WANT TO BE A LOT SO YOU YES

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:07.901
SOMEONE'S NEGOTIATING AND THERE

01:40:07.968 --> 01:40:09.370
FOR IT IS I THINK WE NEED TO BE

01:40:09.436 --> 01:40:13.607
CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE TO THE- TO

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:15.743
THE- EMPLOYERS WHO ARE

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:17.611
NEGOTIATING AS WELL AS THE

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:19.847
UNIONS THAT- THAT DOESN'T

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:22.015
BECOME AN EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING

01:40:22.082 --> 01:40:23.684
ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN IN

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:28.155
GOOD FAITH OR TO- TO LIMIT-

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:29.890
BECAUSE- YEAH. THEN WHAT

01:40:29.957 --> 01:40:30.457
HAPPENS IS LIKE YOU HAVE A

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:31.725
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT YOU

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:33.093

FINALLY OKAY WILL GIVE. YOU AN

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:42.436
INCREASE BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:43.203
CETERA. AND THEN PEOPLE SAY

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.706
NEXT COLLECTIVE ARE GAS. SO WE

01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:47.941
DON'T GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN- SO

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:49.176
I THINK WE NEED TO BUILD IN

01:40:49.243 --> 01:40:50.844
SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE-

01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:54.648

BARGAINING CONTRACT THAT THAT

NEEDS TO BE REFLECTED. SO THAT

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:02.523
THEY CAN GET- SO THAT- THAT

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:05.225
DOESN'T BECOME A BARRIER TO- TO

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:07.327
NEGOTIATING A FAIR CONTRACT- I

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:08.762

INTEREST ON THIS TOPIC- IN BOTH

01:42:00.814 --> 01:42:02.349
HOUSES IN BOTH HOUSES SO WE

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:03.750

THAT- THAT. THE MEMBER WOODS

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:08.589
BILL MAKING OVER TO THE SIDE

01:42:08.655 --> 01:42:10.858
FOR A FULL POLICY HEARING- BUT-

WE HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS- AND I

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:28.275
GUESS IS THE POINT I WANT TO

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:30.344
CONTINUE TO MAKE IS THAT WE

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:32.813
LOOK AT EQUITY. ACROSS THE

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.282
STATE WITH A LOT OF ATTENTION

01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:39.386

ORGANIZATIONS THAT OFTENTIMES

01:42:48.428 --> 01:42:50.297
ARE LESS RESOURCE AND

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:51.765
OFTENTIMES ARE TREATING PEOPLE

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:53.200
AS START DEPEND HAS SAID BEFORE

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:55.202
WHO HAVE EVEN HIGHER. HEALTH

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:57.437
NEEDS- AND IT'S HARDER TO KEEP

01:42:57.504 --> 01:42:59.106
PEOPLE THERE OF PROVIDERS

01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:00.641
THEIR- BECAUSE OFTENTIMES OUR

01:43:00.707 --> 01:43:02.576
SCHOOLS DON'T REFLECT. THE HIGH

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:04.978
QUALITY. THAT SOME FOLKS ARE

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.480
LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY WHEN THEY

01:43:06.547 --> 01:43:08.015
COME OUT OF- COLLEGE WITH A

01:43:08.081 --> 01:43:09.716
WHOLE LOT OF DEBT SO UP IT JUST

01:43:09.783 --> 01:43:11.251
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN. IN

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:12.419
CONJUNCTION WITH ALL THE OTHER

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.688
FACTORS THAT GO INTO OUR HEALTH

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:16.623
OUTCOMES BECAUSE AGAIN AS WE

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:17.558
LOOK AT COSTS WE CAN'T FORGET

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:19.526

THE LGBT CAUCUS ONE OF THE

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:15.354
THINGS THAT WE TALK ABOUT A LOT

01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:16.689
OF THE COLLECTION I WAS THE

01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:18.357
LACK OF COLLECTION OF UP SO G.

01:58:18.424 --> 01:58:20.760
DATA AND THEN BUT THE LACK OF

PRIORITY FOR US AS WELL I WILL

01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:34.774
SAY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE

01:58:34.841 --> 01:58:36.776
HAVE OVERALL IN DATA COLLECTION

01:58:36.843 --> 01:58:38.644
IS WEEK WE DON'T HAVE- YOU KNOW

01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:40.079
COMPLETE ROBUST STATE ON BOTH

01:58:40.146 --> 01:58:41.848
RACE ETHNICITY OBVIOUSLY SO G.

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:44.150
DATE AS WELL- AND THERE'S A

01:58:44.217 --> 01:58:46.652
NUMBER OF WAYS THAT WE CAN LOOK

01:58:46.719 --> 01:58:47.753
AT THAT WE CAN LOOK AT YOU KNOW

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:50.122
GEOGRAPHY ANOTHER PROXIES. IT'S

01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:51.491
AN AREA THAT WE REALLY WILL BE

01:58:51.557 --> 01:58:53.125
LOOKING TO BOTH OUR SISTER

01:58:53.192 --> 01:58:54.393
AGENCIES ALL BUT ALSO THE

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.028
COMMITTEE TO ADVISE US ON HOW

01:58:56.095 --> 01:58:57.663
DO WE CAPTURE THAT DATA HOW DO

01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:58.831
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

01:58:58.898 --> 01:59:00.132
MISSING OUT ON CERTAIN

01:59:00.199 --> 01:59:02.902
COMMUNITIES- THIS IS ANOTHER

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:04.303
AREA THAT I THINK WE ARE

01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:06.305
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT AS

01:59:06.372 --> 01:59:07.373
TIME GOES BY ANDTHE

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:09.041
AVAILABILITY OF THAT DATA WILL

01:59:09.108 --> 01:59:10.943
IMPROVE. AND THIS IS WHERE OUR

01:59:11.010 --> 01:59:12.812
ABILITY TO BE NIMBLE MEN MOVE

01:59:12.879 --> 01:59:14.046
AND MAKE CHANGES TO THOSE

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:15.147
MEASURES AND THE BENCHMARKS

01:59:15.214 --> 01:59:17.483
WILL BE IMPORTANT OKAY AND WHAT

01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:24.223
WE'RE GONNA BE USING THIS. DATA

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:25.625
TO AT. INCREASED EQUITY AND USE

01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:28.160
IT FOR PER. HOW WHAT IS IT WHAT

01:59:28.227 --> 01:59:28.761
IS THE I. ABOUT THE RELATION

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:29.929
BACK WITH THE LATEST AS FAR AS

01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:31.597
REPORTING THIS DATA SO WE CAN

01:59:31.664 --> 01:59:33.599
MAIN WE CAN BE AWARE OF WHERE

01:59:33.666 --> 01:59:35.167
THE GAPS ARE OF- WHICH

01:59:35.234 --> 01:59:36.869
PROVIDERS ARE ARE BEING ABLE TO

01:59:36.936 --> 01:59:38.504
MEET THE OUTCOMES. AND WHAT

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:40.540
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA ABOUT COMING

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:42.775
BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:44.043

HAPPY TO PROVIDE UPDATES- ON ON

01:59:47.547 --> 01:59:49.382
THE WORK THAT WE DO- I THINK

01:59:49.448 --> 01:59:50.750
THE KEY PIECE YEAR ROUND

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:52.385
TRANSPARENCY WILL BE THE ANNUAL

01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:53.920
REPORT THAT WE WILL HAVE ON OUR

01:59:53.986 --> 01:59:55.555
WEBSITE SO OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE

01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:58.391

01:59:58.457 --> 01:59:58.991
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE IT'LL

01:59:59.058 --> 02:00:00.293
BE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE.

02:00:00.359 --> 02:00:01.594
THAT WILL WHO WILL SHOW HOW THE

02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:04.730
PLANS ARE DOING IN TERMS OF

02:00:04.797 --> 02:00:05.331
PERFORMANCE AND MEETING THOSE

02:00:05.398 --> 02:00:08.968
BENCHMARKS. THANK YOU DOCTOR.

02:00:09.035 --> 02:00:10.436
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:14.307
PRESENTATION- IT. AND YES

02:00:14.373 --> 02:00:16.442
CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND- AND

02:00:16.509 --> 02:00:17.810
ENSURE YOUR DESIRE NOT TO

02:00:17.877 --> 02:00:19.512
INCREASE IN MISTER BURDENS ON

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:21.347
PLANTS WERE REPORTING A LOT OF

02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:24.116
DATA TO THE DEPARTMENT AND TO

02:00:24.183 --> 02:00:26.085
OUR STATE GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER I

02:00:26.152 --> 02:00:26.986
THINK IF WE'RE DEALING WITH

02:00:27.053 --> 02:00:29.121
EQUITY- WE HAD WE NEED TO

02:00:29.188 --> 02:00:31.591
RECOGNIZE THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT

02:00:31.657 --> 02:00:34.260
WE HAVE IN PLACE NOW- IT DID

02:00:34.327 --> 02:00:37.964
COME FROM THIS YOU KNOW- THE

02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:40.199
FIRST IS A SYSTEMIC RACISM IT'S

02:00:40.266 --> 02:00:42.101
NICE BUILT INTO OUR SYSTEM SO I

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:43.436
THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK

02:00:43.502 --> 02:00:44.403
CAREFULLY AT OUR EXISTING DATA

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:46.606
SYSTEMS. DATA COLLECTION AND

02:00:46.672 --> 02:00:47.707
LOOK AT WHERE THINGS WERE NOT

02:00:47.773 --> 02:00:48.908
COLLECTING THAT WE PERHAPS

02:00:48.975 --> 02:00:50.576
SHOULD BE SO I APPRECIATE THAT

02:00:50.643 --> 02:00:51.344
YOU'RE LOOKING YOU KNOW YOU'RE

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:52.511
TRYING TO STICK THE THINGS

02:00:52.578 --> 02:00:54.480
YOU'RE A YET BUT I JUST WANT TO

02:00:54.547 --> 02:00:56.449
PUT THAT PEN ON THERE NOT TO

02:00:56.515 --> 02:00:57.717
SAY THAT LET'S GO IN TO CREATE

02:00:57.783 --> 02:00:59.518
A WHOLE BUNCH OF NEW MEASURES-

02:00:59.585 --> 02:01:01.354
BUT I DO THINK THAT'S- SO BUT

02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:02.555
THE ONE PLACE I THINK WE REALLY

02:01:02.622 --> 02:01:04.156
DO NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY

02:01:04.223 --> 02:01:05.625
ABOUT WORK WITH THE PLANS BUT-

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:07.360
BUT BEFORE WE GET REALLY. GOOD

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:10.162
INACCURATE DATA IS AROUND THE

02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:11.731
BENEFICIARIES THEMSELVES

02:01:11.797 --> 02:01:13.633
BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT ALL THE

02:01:13.699 --> 02:01:14.934
REST OF IT YOU CAN'T REALLY

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:16.936
INTERPRET SO FOR EXAMPLE ARE WE

02:01:17.003 --> 02:01:18.771
DO WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:20.439
CONFIDENTIALLY AND ACTUALLY AT

02:01:20.506 --> 02:01:22.675
LEAST TRY TO COLLECT DATA ON-

02:01:22.742 --> 02:01:24.810
YOU KNOW- SEXUAL ORIENTATION

02:01:24.877 --> 02:01:26.746
AND GENDER IDENTITY RIGHT.

02:01:26.812 --> 02:01:28.848
BECAUSE IT BASICALLY IF THERE

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:30.216
ISN'T A MECHANISM DO THAT

02:01:30.282 --> 02:01:31.250
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:33.185
LOOK AT THAT AND THEN I THINK

02:01:33.252 --> 02:01:35.121
FOR THE API COMMUNITY HAVING A

02:01:35.187 --> 02:01:37.423
DISAGGREGATED DATA SO YOU KNOW

02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:39.425
THAT IT'S MENTION THAT. THE

02:01:39.492 --> 02:01:40.459
EIGHTY I CAN BE REPRESENTS

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:41.560
PEOPLE COME FROM THE BIGGEST

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:42.695
COTTON IN THE WORLD THE BIGGEST

02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:44.363
OCEAN IN THE WORLD THERE'S A

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:46.198
LOT OF DIVERSITY WITHIN THAT

02:01:46.265 --> 02:01:46.799
COMMUNITY AND SO IF YOU DON'T

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:52.972
GET THE- DISAGGREGATED DATA.

02:01:53.039 --> 02:01:53.539
GOING TO MISS A LOT THINGS

02:01:53.606 --> 02:01:55.975
THERE- SO. I IS SO. SOME NOT

02:01:56.042 --> 02:01:57.009
SURE THE CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:59.078
ADEQUATE ENOUGH AND THAT THERE

02:01:59.145 --> 02:01:59.879
IS IF WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

02:01:59.945 --> 02:02:02.982
ACHIEVE EQUITY. WE NEED TO.

02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:04.617
DEMAND THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE

02:02:04.684 --> 02:02:05.951
BETTER IN TERMS OF THAT THAT

02:02:06.018 --> 02:02:07.787
BASELINE DATA BECAUSE OTHERWISE

02:02:07.853 --> 02:02:08.721
YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE HEATERS

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:09.855
AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF AND

02:02:09.922 --> 02:02:10.990
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE- PARTS

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:12.558
OUT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE L.

02:02:12.625 --> 02:02:14.226
G. B. T. Q. DATA. YOU DON'T

02:02:14.293 --> 02:02:15.995
HAVE THE DISAGGREGATED AGI DAYS

02:02:16.062 --> 02:02:17.396
SIMPLY SAY LIKE ASIANS ARE

02:02:17.463 --> 02:02:19.198
DOING FINE AND THAT CETERA BUT

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:20.866
IT COULD BE THAT ACTUALLY YOU

02:02:20.933 --> 02:02:22.568
KNOW THE PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:24.236
DOING SO WELL FACT WE SEE THIS

02:02:24.303 --> 02:02:25.337
WITH OPEN RIGHT OPPOSITE GUY

02:02:25.404 --> 02:02:26.205
ANDERS ACTUALLY HAVE THE

02:02:26.272 --> 02:02:27.740
HIGHEST DEATH RATE OF ANY.

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:29.909
GROUP BUT IF WE JUST FOLDED THE

02:02:29.975 --> 02:02:32.678
MEN AS A TI. FELLOW BEEN LOST

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:36.348
SO. SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY

02:02:36.415 --> 02:02:36.882
IMPORTANT THAT. IN AN ECHO

02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:39.418
FRAMEWORK THAT. NOT SAY THAT

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:40.586
WELL WHAT WE HAVE IS GOOD

02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:42.188
ENOUGH WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AND

02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:43.622
COLLECTING AT LEAST. SOME OF

02:02:43.689 --> 02:02:46.125
THE DATA. THE OTHER THING THAT

02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:47.460
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION IS THE

02:02:47.526 --> 02:02:48.761
EDITIONS OF COURSE TO THE DATA

02:02:48.828 --> 02:02:51.230

ALWAYS THIS TRYING TO FIND THIS

02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:49.588
BALANCE FROM TRYING TO CAPTURE

THE DATA TO DO THE APPROPRIATE

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:52.591
MEASUREMENT- WITHOUT CREATING A

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.527
BARRIER TO ENROLLMENT AND IT IS

02:03:54.593 --> 02:03:55.861
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE WILL.

02:03:55.928 --> 02:03:57.897
CONTINUE TO WORK ON- IN

TRANSLATOR SERVICES THAT THIS

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:08.808
PROBLEM. HM THAT'S A

02:04:08.874 --> 02:04:10.543
INTERPRETER SIR. THERE'S

02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:11.877
ACTUALLY A DIFFERENCE.

02:04:11.944 --> 02:04:13.612
CANCELLATION CANCELLATION IS

02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:14.980
DIFFERENT THAN INTERPRETING

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:16.849
TRANSLATION IS CAN JUST BE A

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:18.918
LITERAL TRANSLATION I'LL TELL

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:19.952
YOU AS SOMEONE WHO'S A HEALTH

CARE PROVIDER A LITERAL

02:04:21.787 --> 02:04:22.454
TRANSLATION WELL MORE HELPFUL

02:04:22.521 --> 02:04:25.391
THAN NOTHING DOESN'T INCLUDE

02:04:25.457 --> 02:04:25.958
THE CULTURAL CONTEXT OF THE

02:04:26.025 --> 02:04:28.093
INTERACTION. AND SO IT'S NOT AS

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:30.062
USEFUL THAT'S WHY USE MEDICAL

02:04:30.129 --> 02:04:31.864

TRANSLATORS. SURE NO I AND I

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:37.770
THINK THE OPPORTUNITY THERE IS

02:04:37.837 --> 02:04:39.138
PROBABLY THROUGH SOME SORT OF

02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:41.440
CONSUMER SATISFACTION SURVEY TO

BECAUSE USUALLY IT SHOULD BE

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:49.882
OFTEN AND EXPENSE SO IT'S OUR

02:04:49.949 --> 02:04:51.550
WAY WE CAN COLLECTED ASIDE FROM

02:04:51.617 --> 02:04:53.953

ACCESS. I WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.268
THAT BACK AND SOMETHING THAT WE

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.135

LEAST ONE DOSE. HOWEVER THAT'S

02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:50.369
NOT THE SAME ACROSS THE- STATE

02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:53.238
WITH ONLY 47% OF PEOPLE IN ON

02:11:53.305 --> 02:11:55.207

AND- I'M GREAT WE'VE ALSO BEGUN

02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:12.224
TO SEE A- SLOWDOWN IN THE OPTIC

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:13.692
AND CANCELLING APPOINTMENTS AND

02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:15.294
SO WE ARE LOOKING OUT THAT

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:16.828
ACROSS THE STATE AND LOOKING AT

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:19.631
WAYS OF INCREASING. ON THE

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:21.233
INTEREST IN GETTING VACCINATED

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:25.337
BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE

02:12:25.404 --> 02:12:25.904
TO GET VACCINATED AND MOVING

02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:26.938
AWAY FROM. I'M PLEASED

02:12:27.005 --> 02:12:28.674
VACCINATION SITES NOT THAT WE

02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:29.975
DON'T STILL NEED SOME OF THOSE

02:12:30.042 --> 02:12:31.910
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MOVE OUR

02:12:31.977 --> 02:12:33.945
VACCINATIONS TO SITES WHERE

02:12:34.012 --> 02:12:36.315
PEOPLE ARE FREQUENT- PLACES

02:12:36.381 --> 02:12:38.617
THAT ARE MORE TRUSTED SUCH AS

02:12:38.684 --> 02:12:40.252
SCHOOL CAMPUSES GROCERY STORES.

02:12:40.319 --> 02:12:42.220
A WHOLE HOST OF PLACES WHERE

02:12:42.287 --> 02:12:44.156
THAT MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER AND

02:12:44.222 --> 02:12:45.490
MORE CONVENIENT FOR PEOPLE TO

02:12:45.557 --> 02:12:47.259
GET VACCINATED IF I COULD

02:12:47.326 --> 02:12:48.126
INTERRUPT YOU JUST ONE SECOND

02:12:48.193 --> 02:12:50.629
TO DISHONOR- PREVIOUS MEETING.

02:12:50.696 --> 02:12:53.198
WITH THE GOVERNOR- HE SAID LAST

02:12:53.265 --> 02:12:54.032
FOR FIVE DAYS HAVE BEEN

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:57.002
STARTLING THE DROP OFF SO THAT

02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:58.704
WHEN YOU'RE TRACKING THAT ARE

02:12:58.770 --> 02:13:00.839
YOU ALSO TRACKING IN THAT FROM.

02:13:00.906 --> 02:13:03.208
AN EQUITY STANDPOINT AS FAR AS-

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.344
WHAT WHO WHO'S NOT COMING BACK

02:13:05.410 --> 02:13:06.611
ON WHO'S NOT WHO'S NOT GETTING

02:13:06.678 --> 02:13:08.947
VACCINATED WHO IS THAT SIMILAR

02:13:09.014 --> 02:13:10.849
TO THE EARLIER THE NUMBER SHE

02:13:10.916 --> 02:13:13.518
GAVE. IT IS SIMILAR- I THINK

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:15.153
WE'VE SEEN AND READ DECLINE

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:17.255

02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:21.493
THINK AND IN FACT AND I THINK

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:24.129
THAT GAP BETWEEN Q. FOUR AND Q.

02:13:24.196 --> 02:13:25.831
ONE HAS REDUCED A LITTLE BIT

02:13:25.897 --> 02:13:27.399
BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY IT'S JUST

02:13:27.466 --> 02:13:28.967
A REFLECTION OF REDUCTIONS

02:13:29.034 --> 02:13:32.904

02:17:53.598 --> 02:17:55.800
IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. WE

02:17:55.867 --> 02:17:57.002
PARTICIPATE IN A QUARTER

02:17:57.068 --> 02:17:58.403

APPROACH AS YOU KNOW THIS IS

02:18:04.876 --> 02:18:05.543
MUCH BIGGER THAN THE DEPARTMENT

02:18:05.610 --> 02:18:07.712
OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE ARE AN

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:09.247
ALL OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO

02:18:09.314 --> 02:18:11.116
THIS- AS IT IMPACTS ALMOST

02:18:11.182 --> 02:18:14.085
EVERY ASPECT OF GOVERNMENT AND

02:18:14.152 --> 02:18:14.586
THE SECTORS WITHIN THE

COORDINATED MULTI AGENCY

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:20.692
APPROACH TO- NEED THAT ADDRESS

THE NEEDS OF THE VARIOUS

02:18:22.093 --> 02:18:23.395
SUBGROUPS WITHIN THE POPULATION

02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:25.330
AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA AS- WE

02:18:25.397 --> 02:18:27.399
DEVELOP UNIFIED DATA SYSTEMS

02:18:27.465 --> 02:18:30.068
AND ANALYTICAL DASHBOARDS- FOR.

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:30.802
FOR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY

02:18:30.869 --> 02:18:32.203
CONTINUE ON THAT CROSSES

02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:34.339
MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS. AND THEN

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:35.774
WE'VE REALLY PARTNER WITH OUR

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:37.776
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO

02:18:37.842 --> 02:18:38.209
IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE

02:18:38.276 --> 02:18:40.779
STRATEGIES. I'M AND I THINK

02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:42.347
THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE KEY

02:18:42.414 --> 02:18:45.250
AREAS OF RESPONSE THAT WE ARE.

02:18:45.316 --> 02:18:48.319
CONTINUING AND AS YOU KNOW AS

02:18:48.386 --> 02:18:50.221
ONE SORT OF WHITES DOWN ANOTHER

02:18:50.288 --> 02:18:52.891
ONE. PICKS UP AND SO AS WE ARE

02:18:52.957 --> 02:18:55.226
YEAH WE ALL STILL OBVIOUSLY SEE

02:18:55.293 --> 02:18:57.028
THE VALUE AND NOT ONLY

02:18:57.095 --> 02:18:59.764
VACCINATION BUT IN TESTING AND

02:18:59.831 --> 02:19:01.332
CONTACT TRACING TO MAKE SURE

02:19:01.399 --> 02:19:04.369
THAT NOT ONLY- THAT. STRAINS

02:19:04.436 --> 02:19:05.704
THAT WERE USED TO SEEING AND

02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:11.643
CALIFORNIA BUT SOME OF THE.

02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:12.377
VARIANT STRAINS MATT AND WE

02:19:12.444 --> 02:19:13.812
CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT- SURROUND

02:19:13.878 --> 02:19:16.081
THOSE CASE. AND ICE CORN VOTE

02:19:16.147 --> 02:19:17.082
SO THAT WE DON'T SEE. THE

02:19:17.148 --> 02:19:19.084
VARIANT STRAINS ON GETTING

02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:22.921
BIGGER AND BIGGER. THE QUESTION

02:19:22.987 --> 02:19:24.756
NUMBER THREE HAS A CURRENT-

02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:25.990
COVE IN NINETEEN RESPONSE

02:19:26.057 --> 02:19:27.592
HIGHLIGHTED ANY GAPS AND READY

02:19:27.659 --> 02:19:29.894
IN US THAT MIGHT BE- MIGHT HELP

02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:30.829
THE STATE AND DEPARTMENT OF

02:19:30.895 --> 02:19:32.230
PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH TO PREPARE

02:19:32.297 --> 02:19:35.867
FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC. AND YES

02:19:35.934 --> 02:19:37.736
I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE ALL

02:19:37.802 --> 02:19:39.170
RECOGNIZED AND KNOWN FOR A LONG

02:19:39.237 --> 02:19:42.006
TIME IS THAT THE CORE ASSET OF

02:19:42.073 --> 02:19:44.576
PUBLIC HEALTH IS STAFFING AND

02:19:44.642 --> 02:19:47.545
WE KNOW THAT OVER THE YEARS OF-

02:19:47.612 --> 02:19:50.315
CUTTING OF FUNDS AND- YEAH ONE

02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:51.416
TIME FUNDING SOURCES TO

02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:53.551
ADDRESS. MANY OF BALANCE THAT

02:19:53.618 --> 02:19:56.721
WE HAVE AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

02:19:56.788 --> 02:19:59.524
NEEDS- NEEDS HELP AND PRIMARILY

02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:01.192
AND STAFFING ALSO THE WORLD HAS

02:20:01.259 --> 02:20:02.794
CHANGED A LOT IN TERMS OF DATA

02:20:02.861 --> 02:20:05.029
ANALYTICS AND THE WAY THAT WE

02:20:05.096 --> 02:20:06.397
LOOK AT DATA SO I THINK WE

02:20:06.464 --> 02:20:07.899
WOULD. PUT INTO THE BUCKET OF

02:20:07.966 --> 02:20:11.436
STAFFING THAT WE NEED. BIGGER

02:20:11.503 --> 02:20:12.504
PUBLIC HEALTH AND- THAT

02:20:12.570 --> 02:20:14.405
INCLUDES MORE EPIDEMIOLOGISTS

02:20:14.472 --> 02:20:16.941
GENOMICS ON GENOMIC TESTING AND

02:20:17.008 --> 02:20:19.978
SEQUENCING MODELING- EVALUATION

02:20:20.044 --> 02:20:21.579
OF OUR INTERVENTIONS AND

02:20:21.646 --> 02:20:23.148
PARTNERING WITH ACADEMIC

02:20:23.214 --> 02:20:25.483
INSTITUTIONS IN A BIGGER WAY.

02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:26.918
YOU'VE ALL SEEN IT PLAY OUT

02:20:26.985 --> 02:20:28.486
ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT NEEDS TO

02:20:28.553 --> 02:20:30.288
BE BIGGER IN TERMS OF OUR IT

02:20:30.355 --> 02:20:32.190
AND DATA SYSTEMS AND THAT WE

02:20:32.257 --> 02:20:33.892
HAVE INVESTED A LOT THROUGHOUT

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:35.460
THIS PANDEMIC AND WE ARE ON THE

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:36.594
RIGHT TRACK IN TERMS OF

02:20:36.661 --> 02:20:38.963
BUILDING. THOSE SYSTEMS THAT

02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:41.699
CAN REALLY- WITH STANDARD THE

02:20:41.766 --> 02:20:43.234
NUMBER AND THE TYPES OF

02:20:43.301 --> 02:20:45.537
INFORMATION THAT WE- NEED TO

02:20:45.603 --> 02:20:46.805
PUT I FROM TESTING TO

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:50.241
VACCINATIONS AND I'M CONNECTING

02:20:50.308 --> 02:20:52.377
ALL OF THAT DATA. I THINK THAT

02:20:52.443 --> 02:20:53.812
WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO

02:20:53.878 --> 02:20:55.079
MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:20:55.146 --> 02:20:56.214
SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:57.749
HAVE BUILT FOR THE SCANNED THEM

02:20:57.816 --> 02:20:59.551
EXCELLENT WE ARE INDEED READY

02:20:59.617 --> 02:21:01.186
TO DEAL WITH. ANY PUBLIC HEALTH

02:21:01.252 --> 02:21:03.488
ISSUE BUT ALSO ANY OTHER PUBLIC

02:21:03.555 --> 02:21:04.889
HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT MAY COME

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:06.558
OUR DIRECTION I THINK WE

02:21:06.624 --> 02:21:08.126
HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE H. ONE AND

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:09.127
ONE REPORT BUT WE DIDN'T

02:21:09.194 --> 02:21:10.929
REALLY. KEEP A LOT OF THE

02:21:10.995 --> 02:21:12.630
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE WERE

02:21:12.697 --> 02:21:14.332
ABLE TO BUILD UP DURING H. ONE

02:21:14.399 --> 02:21:18.036
AND ONE AND- LONG ENOUGH TO.

02:21:18.102 --> 02:21:20.305
ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC. THE NEXT

02:21:20.371 --> 02:21:21.506
QUESTION IS HOW SHOULD STATE

02:21:21.573 --> 02:21:22.540
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS APPROACH

02:21:22.607 --> 02:21:23.908
FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

02:21:23.975 --> 02:21:25.677
INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT TOOLS ARE

02:21:25.743 --> 02:21:26.978
AVAILABLE TO HELP DETERMINE

02:21:27.045 --> 02:21:28.780
WHERE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. OF

02:21:28.847 --> 02:21:30.815
EXISTING PROGRAMS AS REQUIRED

02:21:30.882 --> 02:21:32.851
AND WHETHER THERE IS A NEED. TO

02:21:32.917 --> 02:21:34.485
ADDRESS FUNDING GAPS OR TO

02:21:34.552 --> 02:21:36.621
ASSESS WHAT THOSE GAPS ARE. I

02:21:36.688 --> 02:21:38.022
THINK HISTORICALLY FUNDING FOR

02:21:38.089 --> 02:21:39.424
PUBLIC HEALTH HAS INCREASED

02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:40.758
MOSTLY IN RESPONSE TO

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:42.694
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS. AND THESE

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.429
FUNDING INCREASES AS I'M SAT

02:21:44.495 --> 02:21:47.332
HAVE BEEN SHORT TERM. ONE TIME-

02:21:47.398 --> 02:21:49.033
AND HAVEN'T ALLOWED US TO BUILD

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:50.535
SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH

02:21:50.602 --> 02:21:52.370
AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL.

02:21:52.437 --> 02:21:53.671
AND WE NEED THAT STRONG

02:21:53.738 --> 02:21:55.240
INFRASTRUCTURE TO RESPOND TO

02:21:55.306 --> 02:21:56.875
FUTURE EVENTS AS RIGHT AS WELL

02:21:56.941 --> 02:21:59.277
AS PROMOTE. OUR REGULAR HEALTH

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:00.912
PROGRAMS. THIS FUNDING NEEDS TO

02:22:00.979 --> 02:22:02.513
ACCOUNT FOR BOTH THE INCREASING

02:22:02.580 --> 02:22:03.715
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN

02:22:03.781 --> 02:22:05.617
RESOURCES AND INFORMATION

02:22:05.683 --> 02:22:07.218
TECHNOLOGY AS YOU KNOW EVEN IF

02:22:07.285 --> 02:22:08.887
YOU'VE GOT LEVEL FUNDING. OVER

02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:11.222
TIME THE COST FOR SALARIES AND

02:22:11.289 --> 02:22:12.223
BENEFITS AND THOSE KIND OF

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:13.858
THINGS CONTINUE TO INCREASE SO

02:22:13.925 --> 02:22:14.993
YOU'RE REALLY. GETTING A

02:22:15.059 --> 02:22:16.895
REDUCTION IF YOU'RE NOT KEEPING

02:22:16.961 --> 02:22:18.897
UP WITH THOSE BENEFIT COSTS.

02:22:18.963 --> 02:22:20.064
AND THERE ARE TOOLS THAT

02:22:20.131 --> 02:22:21.432
ESTIMATE NECESSARY STAFFING

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:23.001
LEVELS FOR AND NEED IT FOR MANY

02:22:23.067 --> 02:22:25.470
PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS- YOU

02:22:25.536 --> 02:22:27.171
KNOW WE JUST CAN USE THE

02:22:27.238 --> 02:22:29.507
EXAMPLE OF CONTACT TRACING.

02:22:29.574 --> 02:22:31.509
FIFTEEN CONTACT TRACERS FOR

02:22:31.576 --> 02:22:32.310
EVERY HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:22:32.377 --> 02:22:34.045
POPULATION- YOU KNOW THERE ARE

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:37.148
MANY PROGRAMS THAT SET UP. ON

02:22:37.215 --> 02:22:38.917
HOW MANY STAFF YOU SHOULD HAVE

02:22:38.983 --> 02:22:40.518
ON A PER CAPITA ASIS. THERE

02:22:40.585 --> 02:22:42.253
ARE ALSO OTHER MODELS THAT LOOK

02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:44.956
AT. PER CAPITA SPENDING ON

02:22:45.023 --> 02:22:46.190
PUBLIC HEALTH. AND YOU KNOW

02:22:46.257 --> 02:22:48.526
MANY- COME MAKE COMPARISONS ARE

02:22:48.593 --> 02:22:49.961
FROM ACROSS THE NATION ACROSS

02:22:50.028 --> 02:22:54.766
THE WORLD ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS.

02:22:54.832 --> 02:22:55.400
IN PUBLIC HEALTH PER CAPITA. I

02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:57.702
THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE UNLESS. IN

02:22:57.769 --> 02:22:59.637
ORDER ACCURATE ACCURATELY GAUGE

02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:00.805
WHETHER ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF

02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:02.507
EXISTING PROGRAMS AS REQUIRED I

02:23:02.573 --> 02:23:04.342
THINK IT COULD BE HELPFUL TO DO

02:23:04.409 --> 02:23:05.643
SOME SORT OF AN ASSESSMENT

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:08.079
PARTICULARLY. IF WE COULD

02:23:08.146 --> 02:23:11.549
DESIGN THAT IS THAT I'M- THE

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:13.051
ASSESSMENT SUCH A WAY THAT

02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:14.919
ALLOWED FOR LOCAL FLEXIBILITY

02:23:14.986 --> 02:23:16.854
AND STILL MEASURED SOME CORE

02:23:16.921 --> 02:23:19.190
CAPABILITIES OF EACH PUBLIC

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:20.858
HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WE WOULD

02:23:20.925 --> 02:23:22.794
NEED TO SORT OF DO THAT THROUGH

02:25:27.919 --> 02:25:28.886
WHEN YOU HAVE CATEGORICAL

02:25:28.953 --> 02:25:30.788
FUNDING IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:33.191
HARDER TO DO AND THAT CROSS

02:25:33.257 --> 02:25:34.659
TRAINING BUT WE DO BELIEVE

NEXT BIG THING- AN EQUITY

02:25:45.169 --> 02:25:47.238

02:25:47.305 --> 02:25:49.407
THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC OF THOSE

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:51.476

CHRONIC DISEASE MENTAL ILLNESS

02:26:40.958 --> 02:26:43.194
AND SUBSTANCE USE AND SO WE

02:26:43.261 --> 02:26:44.762
WANT TO LOOK AT THE SOCIAL

02:26:44.829 --> 02:26:45.596

PANDEMIC AND THAT'S BEEN HAD IN

02:26:52.436 --> 02:26:54.906
AN ENORMOUS AND LONG LASTING

02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:55.406
IMPACT THAT WE DON'T YET

02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:58.009
UNDERSTAND. AND WE KNOW THAT

02:26:58.075 --> 02:26:59.510
WE'RE THAT CHALLENGE OVER

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:01.379
PROMOTING AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY

02:27:01.445 --> 02:27:04.115
IS A LONG TERM ENDEAVOR AND WE

02:27:04.182 --> 02:27:04.715
NEED TO BE READY TO TAKE THAT

02:27:04.782 --> 02:27:08.085
ON. I AM AND I THINK YOU KNOW

02:27:08.152 --> 02:27:09.554
THE STRATEGIES ARE TO ASSESS

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:11.522
AND MONITOR CHANGES IN THE

02:27:11.589 --> 02:27:13.891
RANGE OF CONDITIONS AND FACTORS

02:27:13.958 --> 02:27:15.092

MODEL TO ESTABLISH ESTABLISH

02:27:23.701 --> 02:27:25.536
THOSE POPULATION RESULT IN

02:27:25.603 --> 02:27:26.837
INDICATORS SO WE REALLY CAN

02:27:26.904 --> 02:27:28.806
MEASURE THEM OVER TIME. AND

02:27:28.873 --> 02:27:30.274
INCORPORATE A TARGETED SET OF

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:31.776

NATURE AND- THE LEGISLATURE

TIRELESS WORK. DURING THIS

03:04:18.747 --> 03:04:20.682
PANDEMIC AND ALL THE TIME I

03:04:20.749 --> 03:04:22.918
PUBLIC. EVERYBODY KNOWS NOW HOW

03:04:22.985 --> 03:04:25.053
IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH IS-

03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:26.155
DURING THE PANDEMIC I WAS

03:04:26.221 --> 03:04:27.222
MOSTLY DEALING WITH I JUST HAD

03:04:27.289 --> 03:04:28.590
A SINGLE COUNTY AT THAT TIME

03:04:28.657 --> 03:04:30.125
BUT I BUT I KNOW ISSUES AROUND

03:04:30.192 --> 03:04:32.327
CAL READY AND DATA ENTRY AND

03:04:32.394 --> 03:04:34.329
COMMUNICATION. ALL OF THOSE

03:04:34.396 --> 03:04:36.765
THINGS OF COURSE. WERE WERE

03:04:36.832 --> 03:04:38.934
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH

03:04:39.001 --> 03:04:41.770
THEM BUT I'M PARTICULARLY

03:04:41.837 --> 03:04:42.371
INTERESTED ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE

03:04:42.438 --> 03:04:45.974
LOOKING AT. OUR OUR VACCINE

03:04:46.041 --> 03:04:48.377
RATES GOING DOWN. AND ALSO IT'S

03:04:48.444 --> 03:04:50.045
JUST SOME OF THE- THE STRESS

03:04:50.112 --> 03:04:51.447
AND TENSION I THINK THAT WAS

03:04:51.513 --> 03:04:54.116
CREATED. BY NOT HAVING FULLY

03:04:54.183 --> 03:04:56.051
FUNDED PUBLIC HEALTH AND JUST

03:04:56.118 --> 03:04:57.252
THE DIVISION THAT WE ARE

03:04:57.319 --> 03:05:08.997
EXPERIENCING THEN. BUT THIS

03:05:09.064 --> 03:05:09.631
IDEA AROUND MESSAGING I IS AND

03:05:09.698 --> 03:05:10.265
IMPORTANT AND I'M ONE. I DON'T

03:05:10.332 --> 03:05:11.166
KNOW FROM THE LOW BUT ALL FROM

03:05:11.233 --> 03:05:12.367
THE STATE LEVEL HOW ARE WE-

03:05:12.434 --> 03:05:13.001
HOWEVER WE USE EVERYTHING THAT

03:05:13.068 --> 03:05:13.602
WE'VE- AND WE'RE THINKING.

03:05:13.669 --> 03:05:14.369
MESSAGE AND FOR. TO LIKE THAT I

03:05:14.436 --> 03:05:15.437
MEAN I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT

03:05:15.504 --> 03:05:18.373
THE- AT T. IT WAS A HOT MESS.

03:05:18.440 --> 03:05:19.908
WE DID THE BEST WE COULD SOME

03:05:19.975 --> 03:05:22.044
OF THE BEING FAXED AND HAND

03:05:22.110 --> 03:05:25.314
WRITTEN AND- EVERYTHING WE CAN

03:05:25.380 --> 03:05:26.748
WE'LL DO BETTER ON THAT BUT

03:05:26.815 --> 03:05:28.150
THIS IDEA OF MESSAGING I THINK

03:05:28.217 --> 03:05:30.486
IS SO IMPORTANT- COMING OUT OF

03:05:30.552 --> 03:05:32.087
THIS PANDEMIC RIGHT NOW CAN CAN

03:05:32.154 --> 03:05:33.822
SIMPLY SPEAK TO MIL ROUTE

03:05:33.889 --> 03:05:35.491
MESSAGING ON WHAT THE PLAN IS

03:05:35.557 --> 03:05:37.693
FOR THAT GOING FORWARD JUST IN

03:05:37.759 --> 03:05:39.361
IN GETTING VACCINATED BUT EVEN

03:05:39.428 --> 03:05:41.597
THEN FURTHER THAT JUST IT

03:05:41.663 --> 03:05:42.197
WOULDN'T GET BACK TO TALKING

03:05:42.264 --> 03:05:44.233
ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH IN A WAY

03:05:44.299 --> 03:05:49.838
THAT- MOST AMERICANS CAN HEAR.

03:05:49.905 --> 03:05:56.512
AND WHAT'S THAT GOING TO COST.

03:05:56.578 --> 03:05:57.145
DURING THE FINALE MIGHT HAVE TO

03:09:17.979 --> 03:09:20.348
FOUNDATIONAL CAPABILITIES THAT

INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES IT'S

03:11:13.762 --> 03:11:15.130
BEEN THE TOP OF OUR DISCUSSIONS

03:11:15.197 --> 03:11:17.132
IN GOING IN AND MAKING SURE

OTHER AREAS OUTSIDE OF VACCINE

03:11:34.649 --> 03:11:35.450
MESSAGING THAT I THINK IS

03:11:35.517 --> 03:11:36.785
REALLY IMPORTANT AS- I THINK

03:11:36.852 --> 03:11:39.254
THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE-

03:11:39.321 --> 03:11:40.989
SOME. SOME BROAD MESSAGING

03:11:41.056 --> 03:11:42.357
ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE

03:11:42.424 --> 03:11:43.658
OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE AGING

03:11:43.725 --> 03:11:44.826
WORKFORCE AND AS YOU HEARD

03:11:44.893 --> 03:11:47.028
FROM- THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH.

03:11:47.095 --> 03:11:49.030
AND PARTICIPANTS THERE'S A LOT

03:11:49.097 --> 03:11:50.198
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIND OF LEFT

03:11:50.265 --> 03:11:51.299
PUBLIC HEALTH DURING THIS TIME

03:11:51.366 --> 03:11:52.868
REALLY WERE EARLY RETIREMENTS

03:11:52.934 --> 03:11:54.369
AND SO FORTH AND SO WE WILL

03:11:54.436 --> 03:11:55.370
NEED TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH

03:11:55.437 --> 03:11:56.805
WORKFORCE CAMPAIGN TO DRIVE

03:11:56.872 --> 03:11:57.973
INTEREST INTO THE PUBLIC HEALTH

03:11:58.039 --> 03:11:59.541
WORKFORCE. AND THEN LASTLY I

03:11:59.608 --> 03:12:02.244
THINK AND- DURING THE PANDEMIC

03:12:02.310 --> 03:12:04.145
FOLKS KNOW WHO PUBLIC HEALTH IS

03:12:04.212 --> 03:12:05.513
THAT OFTEN BECAUSE OF RULES AND

03:12:05.580 --> 03:12:06.615
REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS LIKE

03:12:06.681 --> 03:12:07.515
THAT THAT WERE DUE TO THE

03:12:07.582 --> 03:12:09.384
PANDEMIC- I THINK IT'S REALLY

03:12:09.451 --> 03:12:10.719
IMPORTANT FOR US TO CHANGE THAT

03:12:10.785 --> 03:12:12.053
NARRATIVE AND SHOW ALL OF THE

03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:13.488
OTHER AREAS IN WHICH PUBLIC

03:12:13.555 --> 03:12:14.756
HEALTH HELPS TO BENEFIT

03:12:14.823 --> 03:12:16.892
COMMUNITIES AND NOT JUST THAT.

03:12:16.958 --> 03:12:18.026
THE RULES IN THE ENFORCEMENT

03:12:18.093 --> 03:12:19.094
SIDE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SO I

FIVE PERCENT. I'M OVER THE PAST

03:15:52.807 --> 03:15:54.075
DECADES AND SO I THINK IT'S

03:15:54.142 --> 03:15:55.443
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT TO THINK

03:15:55.510 --> 03:15:56.878
THROUGH THAT. PART OF THE

03:15:56.945 --> 03:15:58.246
REASON WHY WE REALLY NEED THE

03:15:58.313 --> 03:16:01.449

WORKFORCE THE TO BE FOR OUR

03:16:04.285 --> 03:16:05.920
STATE BUT ONE THING THAT I CAN

SAY IS WE WILL BE. IN AND LOCAL

03:16:08.123 --> 03:16:09.224
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THERE WILL

03:16:09.290 --> 03:16:10.725
BE THAT THE TWO COMPETING

03:16:10.792 --> 03:16:13.595
ISSUES ONE IS THAT WE NEED

03:16:13.661 --> 03:16:14.662
ONGOING FUNDING IN ORDER TO

03:16:14.729 --> 03:16:16.097
BOLSTER AND GROW THAT WORK

03:16:16.164 --> 03:16:17.465
FORCE THE OTHER IS THAT WE WILL

03:16:17.532 --> 03:16:18.800
BE BACK FILLING POSITIONS THAT

03:16:18.867 --> 03:16:20.835

OTHER STATES. HE MAY BE TO THE

03:20:23.978 --> 03:20:26.681

ALSO THE RIPPLE RESPONDED FIRES

03:25:29.684 --> 03:25:31.085
AND OTHER EVENTS THAT HAPPEN

03:25:31.152 --> 03:25:32.486
EVERY YEAR RIGHT AND THEN WE

03:25:32.553 --> 03:25:33.721
HAVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND

THEN THE OTHER PART IS I JUST

03:25:43.731 --> 03:25:46.534
ON THE STAFFING LEVEL- AND I

03:25:46.600 --> 03:25:47.601
KNOW THERE'S VARIOUS PROPOSAL

03:25:47.668 --> 03:25:50.871
OUT THERE- BUT- SHOULDN'T HAVE

03:25:50.938 --> 03:25:53.007
SO YOU KNOW AND- YES WE HAD

03:25:53.074 --> 03:25:54.742
ESSENTIALLY. WE HAVE A CERTAIN

03:25:54.809 --> 03:25:56.143
YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A SYSTEM

03:25:56.210 --> 03:25:58.312
MUTUAL AID SYSTEM RIGHT. SO WE

HAVE FIRE DEPARTMENTS- YES

03:25:59.880 --> 03:26:01.382
PROVIDES THEM WITH FIRE TRUCKS

03:26:01.449 --> 03:26:02.983
AND OTHER TYPES OF EQUIPMENT

03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:03.784
AND THEN WHEN THERE'S OF

03:26:03.851 --> 03:26:06.053
WILDFIRE AND YES THERE'S BEEN

03:26:06.120 --> 03:26:07.421
TIMES THEY'VE BEEN OVERRUN

03:26:07.488 --> 03:26:09.056
BLENDER SO MANY WILDFIRES BUT-

03:26:09.123 --> 03:26:10.191
HAVE WE THOUGHT ABOUT

03:26:10.257 --> 03:26:11.459
ESSENTIALLY A KIND OF MUTUAL

03:26:11.525 --> 03:26:13.461
AID SYSTEM FUNDED BY THE STATE

03:26:13.527 --> 03:26:14.428
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WHERE WE

03:26:14.495 --> 03:26:15.529
ACTUALLY PAY FOR IT WOULD NOT

03:26:15.596 --> 03:26:17.064
FIRE TRUCKS BUT MAYBE STE.

03:26:17.131 --> 03:26:19.333
PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF WILL BE

03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:20.668
STATIONED AT LOCAL YOU KNOW AND

03:26:20.735 --> 03:26:21.836
ACTUALLY IMPRESSED PAID FOR BY

03:26:21.902 --> 03:26:23.337
COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OR

03:26:23.404 --> 03:26:24.271
CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT THE

03:26:24.338 --> 03:26:25.973
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BUT-

03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:27.308
COULD BE MOBILIZED ONE HAVE

03:26:27.374 --> 03:26:29.376
BASIC SKILL SETS THAT COULD BE

03:26:29.443 --> 03:26:31.178
MOBILIZED TO HANDLE OUTBREAKS-

03:26:31.245 --> 03:26:33.881
SAYS- SO THAT- WE WOULD BE SO

03:26:33.948 --> 03:26:35.850
WE HAVE. THAT IN PLACE A MUTUAL

03:26:35.916 --> 03:26:37.785
AID SYSTEM HAS BEEN DISCUSSIONS

03:26:37.852 --> 03:26:39.420
ABOUT THAT FOR IS A WAY TO IS

03:26:39.487 --> 03:26:46.627
THIS ONE AT LEAST. ONE ELEMENT

03:26:46.694 --> 03:26:47.328
OF THE WORK FORCE APPROACH. WE

03:26:47.394 --> 03:26:47.862
ARE USING SOME OF FEDERAL

03:26:47.928 --> 03:26:48.529
DOLLARS LOOK AT OF LIKE A- HOW.

03:26:48.596 --> 03:26:50.831
CORPS AND LOOKING AT WAYS TO

03:26:50.898 --> 03:26:52.533
BUILD UP SOME OF THOSE STAFF

03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:54.001
AND PLACING THEM AND LOCAL

03:26:54.068 --> 03:26:56.170
JURISDICTIONS SO WE ARE. DOING

03:26:56.237 --> 03:26:58.639
SOME OF THAT WE HAVE- YOU CDC

03:26:58.706 --> 03:27:00.875
STAFF IN THAT SAME WAY-

03:27:00.941 --> 03:27:02.777
THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC. I

03:27:02.843 --> 03:27:03.711
WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW OUR

03:27:03.778 --> 03:27:05.446
LOCAL PARTNERS. DO YOU HAVE A

03:27:05.513 --> 03:27:07.548
PRETTY ROBUST MUTUAL AID SYSTEM

03:27:07.615 --> 03:27:09.216
WHEN EMERGENCIES HIT. WHERE

03:27:09.283 --> 03:27:10.951
THEY DO RESPOND TO ONE ANOTHER

03:27:11.018 --> 03:27:12.720
AND PUT SOME OF THEIR- HAPPY

03:27:12.787 --> 03:27:14.922
STAFF SOME OF THEIR RESPONSE

03:27:14.989 --> 03:27:17.358
STAFF IN- ONE. AND YOU KNOW

03:27:17.424 --> 03:27:18.759
FROM ONE JURISDICTION INTO AN

03:27:18.826 --> 03:27:20.294
IMPACTED JURISDICTION BUT I

03:27:20.361 --> 03:27:22.096
THINK. THAT IS MORE BECAUSE WE

03:27:22.163 --> 03:27:22.897
UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR

03:27:22.963 --> 03:27:24.765
RESPONSE IT DOES IMPACT BOTH OF

03:27:24.832 --> 03:27:26.000
THOSE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN

03:27:26.066 --> 03:27:27.735
TERMS OF- LETTING SOME OF THEIR

03:27:27.802 --> 03:27:29.603
STAFF AND- SO. WE DEFINITELY

03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:31.305
RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THAT SO

03:27:31.372 --> 03:27:32.439
I HOPE I HOPE THERE CAN BE SOME

03:27:32.506 --> 03:27:34.508
WORK. DONE ON THAT AND I

03:27:34.575 --> 03:27:36.777
REALIZE THAT FIRST OF ALL- I

03:27:36.844 --> 03:27:37.912
KNOW THAT. PUBLIC HEALTH

03:27:37.978 --> 03:27:39.547
COOPERATIVES THE OTHER PART IS

03:27:39.613 --> 03:27:40.648
BECAUSE WE ARE EVERYONE SO

03:27:40.714 --> 03:27:42.149
SHORT STAFFED. I DON'T THINK

03:27:42.216 --> 03:27:43.217
IT. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON

03:27:43.284 --> 03:27:44.351
PEOPLE HAVE TO DO THAT AS WELL

03:27:44.418 --> 03:27:45.486
BUT LET'S THINK ABOUT DOING IN

03:27:45.553 --> 03:27:46.420
A WAY THAT ACTUALLY IS IT JUST

03:27:46.487 --> 03:27:47.688
BECAUSE WE'RE SHORT STAFFED

03:27:47.755 --> 03:27:48.455
BECAUSE WERE ADEQUATELY

03:27:48.522 --> 03:27:51.058
STAFFED. SO SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN

03:27:51.125 --> 03:27:52.359
LOOK AT THAT AND THEN FINALLY.

03:27:52.426 --> 03:27:54.428
I IN TERMS OF LAB RESOURCES AND

03:27:54.495 --> 03:27:56.030
I KNOW WE TALKED- TOUCHED ON.

03:27:56.096 --> 03:27:57.298
IT A IT WAS MENTIONED THAT

03:27:57.364 --> 03:27:59.300
MANY. REGIONAL LABS ARE CLOSED.

03:27:59.366 --> 03:28:01.335
IS THERE IS THAT THERE IS THERE

03:28:01.402 --> 03:28:03.504
BEEN DISCUSSIONS AT C. PH AND

03:28:03.571 --> 03:28:04.738
REGIONALLY AND THEN MAYBE WE

03:28:04.805 --> 03:28:06.907
CAN ALSO HAVE. THIS GIVENS

03:28:06.974 --> 03:28:09.143
ADDRESSED THIS. AT ALL THE

03:28:09.210 --> 03:28:10.244
DIFFERENT EIGHT YOU KNOW I KIND

03:28:10.311 --> 03:28:11.579
OF DROPPED HER OFF BUT YOU KNOW

03:28:11.645 --> 03:28:12.680
SOME OF THESE ITEMS AS WELL

03:28:12.746 --> 03:28:14.648
AFTER ACKERMAN C. PH. IN TERMS

03:28:14.715 --> 03:28:16.717
OF MAYBE A REGIONAL APPROACH TO

03:28:16.784 --> 03:28:19.620
LAB. TWO TWO TWO LABS. BECAUSE

03:28:19.687 --> 03:28:21.722
IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE. COUNTIES

03:28:21.789 --> 03:28:23.224
AT CLOSE LABS BUT THERE'S NOT

03:28:23.290 --> 03:28:25.492
LIKE A SYSTEMATIC PLAN. SO THEN

03:28:25.559 --> 03:28:26.660
THE COUNTY GOES OKAY WE'LL

03:28:26.727 --> 03:28:27.895
CLOSE OUR LAB AND THEN WE'LL

03:28:27.962 --> 03:28:29.964
FIND SOME OTHER COUNTY LAB TO

03:28:30.030 --> 03:28:32.366
COVER FOR US IT'S UNDER- BUT-

03:28:32.433 --> 03:28:33.601
THAT IS THERE SOME SORT OF

03:28:33.667 --> 03:28:35.035
PLANNING APPROACH TO LAB

03:28:35.102 --> 03:28:36.837
CAPACITY. BEYOND YOU KNOW

03:28:36.904 --> 03:28:38.405
OBVIOUSLY A STATE LAB BUT THEN

03:28:38.472 --> 03:28:39.940
WE ALSO. YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE

03:28:40.007 --> 03:28:46.413
SOME REMAINING COUNTY LABS. IS.

03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:46.981
THERE REGIONAL APPROACH TO A

03:28:47.047 --> 03:28:49.049
LAB RESOURCES. SOME NOW I THINK

03:28:49.116 --> 03:28:50.718
WE RE EXAMINING THAT WITH OUR

03:28:50.784 --> 03:28:52.353
LOCAL PARTNERS WERE SETTING UP

03:28:52.419 --> 03:28:53.921
SOME PUBLIC HEALTH WORK FORCE

03:28:53.988 --> 03:28:55.356
AND WORK GROUPS TO REALLY LOOK

03:28:55.422 --> 03:28:57.825
AT. I'M AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN

03:28:57.892 --> 03:28:59.526
THE PANDEMIC AS WELL AS AND

03:28:59.593 --> 03:29:01.128
WHAT COMES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

03:29:01.195 --> 03:29:02.863
THE PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF THE

03:29:02.930 --> 03:29:04.698
NEED FOR. LOOKING AT WHAT.

03:29:04.765 --> 03:29:06.333
CAPABILITY SHOULD BE REGIONAL

03:29:06.400 --> 03:29:08.502
WHAT. CAPABILITIES SHOULD BE

03:29:08.569 --> 03:29:10.337
STATEWIDE WHAT SHOULD BE LOCAL.

03:29:10.404 --> 03:29:11.939
I'M AND REALLY LOOKING AT OUR

03:29:12.006 --> 03:29:12.773
PUBLIC HEALTH LAB

03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:14.341
INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE OF THOSE

03:29:14.408 --> 03:29:15.643
THINGS WE'VE LEARNED A LOT.

03:29:15.709 --> 03:29:17.945
ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO MEET AND

03:29:18.012 --> 03:29:20.514
THAT. NEED FOR NAY ABILITY TO

03:29:20.581 --> 03:29:22.249
BRING ON NEW TASKS AND BRING

03:29:22.316 --> 03:29:24.251
THEM ON QUICKLY AND TO YOU.

03:29:24.318 --> 03:29:25.719
KNOW WITH HE VALENCIA LAB SORT

03:29:25.786 --> 03:29:26.954
OF WHAT THE FUTURE OF THAT LAB

03:29:27.021 --> 03:29:29.556
LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF- BOW

03:29:29.623 --> 03:29:32.092
QUARTER PUBLIC HEALTH. CAPACITY

03:29:32.159 --> 03:29:33.560
BUT I THINK AND YOU KNOW

03:29:33.627 --> 03:29:35.462
THERE'S ROOM TO GROW- AND I

03:29:35.529 --> 03:29:37.464
THINK THAT WE WOULD ALL AGREE

03:29:37.531 --> 03:29:39.500
THAT EACH HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

03:29:39.566 --> 03:29:40.501
HAVING THEIR OWN PUBLIC HEALTH

03:29:40.567 --> 03:29:42.336
LAB PROBABLY. MAKES SENSE IN

03:29:42.403 --> 03:29:43.604
TERMS OF SOME OF THE WORK THAT

03:29:43.671 --> 03:29:45.773
NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT WHERE-

03:29:45.839 --> 03:29:47.274
MAYBE IT JUST DOESN'T IF THE

03:29:47.341 --> 03:29:48.809
COUNTY IS SO SMALL WHERE WE A

03:29:48.876 --> 03:29:49.944
REGIONAL APPROACH MIGHT MAKE.

03:29:50.010 --> 03:29:51.879
SENSE I THINK OR WHAT I'M

03:29:51.946 --> 03:29:53.080
THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF

03:29:53.147 --> 03:29:54.648
REGIONAL APPROACH IS MAYBE.

03:29:54.715 --> 03:29:56.684
SPECIALIZING SOME OF OUR LABS

03:29:56.750 --> 03:29:58.218
TO PLAY SOME OF THE ROLES. THAT

03:29:58.285 --> 03:30:00.721
MAYBE EVERY LAB HERE- PLAY.

03:30:00.788 --> 03:30:02.923
THAT'S REGIONALIZATION. WELL AT

03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.991
THE AT THE END LIKE IT'S A

03:30:04.058 --> 03:30:05.459
THINK ABOUT MORE SYSTEMATICALLY

03:30:05.526 --> 03:30:06.994
THAN JUST THE EACH COUNTY BOARD

03:30:07.061 --> 03:30:08.128
SUPERVISORS GOING WITHIN CLOSE

03:30:08.195 --> 03:30:10.030
OUR LAB. SO AND- HOW WE'RE

03:30:10.097 --> 03:30:10.831
GOING TO GO ABOUT SUPPORTING

03:30:10.898 --> 03:30:12.967
THE LABS ARE THERE SO. MAYBE

03:30:13.033 --> 03:30:14.101
PERHAPS WE CAN NOT FOLLOW UP ON

03:30:14.168 --> 03:30:15.302
AGAIN I TALKED ABOUT THE IT

03:30:15.369 --> 03:30:17.504
INFRASTRUCTURE. STAFFAN LABS

03:30:17.571 --> 03:30:19.073
PERHAPS MAYBE MICHELLE GIBBONS

03:30:19.139 --> 03:30:20.574
AND PERHAPS ALSO CITED THAT IF

03:30:20.641 --> 03:30:22.109
WE CAN HAVE THE HEALTH OFFICERS

03:30:22.176 --> 03:30:23.677
DOWN THE COUNTY DR- SORRY

03:30:23.744 --> 03:30:25.713
VISION PAN. MAYBE COMMENT ON

03:30:25.779 --> 03:30:31.518
THOSE ITEMS AS WELL. FROM THEIR

03:30:31.585 --> 03:30:32.286
EXPERIENCES AND THE COUNTY. I

03:30:32.353 --> 03:30:33.320
THINK IT'S AN PAN QUESTIONS IS

03:30:33.387 --> 03:30:34.455
USED. AND I WOULD JUST SAY

03:30:34.521 --> 03:30:36.457
TERMS THE TWENTY NINETEEN

03:30:36.523 --> 03:30:37.191
MEASLES OUTBREAK YOU ARE

03:30:37.257 --> 03:30:38.926
CORRECTED THAT THERE ALWAYS HAS

03:30:38.993 --> 03:30:40.861
TO BE A SHIFT OF. FOCUS IN A

03:30:40.928 --> 03:30:42.029
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHEN

03:30:42.096 --> 03:30:43.764
THERE IS AN OUTBREAK. AND SO

03:30:43.831 --> 03:30:45.232
MANY OF THE STAFF GET COLD FROM

03:30:45.299 --> 03:30:46.967
OTHER ISSUES OTHER AT PUBLIC

03:30:47.034 --> 03:30:48.936
HEALTH PROGRAM SO YOU CAN.

03:30:49.003 --> 03:30:50.738
IMAGINE SOMEONE AND THAT S. TV

03:30:50.804 --> 03:30:52.773
PROGRAMS. AND GETTING PULLED

03:30:52.840 --> 03:30:54.675
OVER TO YOU KNOW FOCUS ON THE

03:30:54.742 --> 03:30:55.976
MEASLES OUTBREAK IN NEW DISEASE

03:30:56.043 --> 03:30:57.678
INVESTIGATION. THE ONE THING I

03:30:57.745 --> 03:30:59.079
JUST WANTED TO REALLY CALL OUT

03:30:59.146 --> 03:31:01.081
IS WHEN THEY'RE BECAUSE WE ALL

03:31:01.148 --> 03:31:02.249
KNOW THAT FEDERAL FUNDING

03:31:02.316 --> 03:31:03.817
USUALLY COMES DOWN FOR THE BIG

03:31:03.884 --> 03:31:06.020
THINGS AND- AND- WIN THAT%

03:31:06.086 --> 03:31:07.454
DISEASE OUTBREAK HAPPENS IN THE

03:31:07.521 --> 03:31:08.655
FEDERAL FUNDS COME DOWN THEY'RE

03:31:08.722 --> 03:31:11.191
STILL. AT A TIME LAG. IN

03:31:11.258 --> 03:31:12.559
ADDITION WE'RE TAKING A

03:31:12.626 --> 03:31:14.061
INDIVIDUAL FRIEND ANOTHER

03:31:14.128 --> 03:31:15.629
PROGRAM THAT'S FEDERALLY FUNDED

03:31:15.696 --> 03:31:16.930
POTENTIALLY OR STATE FUNDED

03:31:16.997 --> 03:31:18.665
WITH REQUIREMENTS. THEN THAT

03:31:18.732 --> 03:31:20.734
THEN HAVE TO BE SHIFTED OVER TO

03:31:20.801 --> 03:31:22.036
THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE

03:31:22.102 --> 03:31:23.637
COMING DOWN THE WAY. AND SO

03:31:23.704 --> 03:31:24.571
THAT MEANS THAT THERE MIGHT BE

03:31:24.638 --> 03:31:25.839
A GAP IN TIME IN WHICH THAT

03:31:25.906 --> 03:31:28.609
PERSON CANNOT ACTUALLY. MEET

03:31:28.675 --> 03:31:29.710
THE DELIVERABLES OF THEIR

03:31:29.777 --> 03:31:31.512
ORIGINAL PROGRAM AND THEN PUT A

03:31:31.578 --> 03:31:32.746
FURTHER STRAIN ON THE LOCAL

03:31:32.813 --> 03:31:33.881
HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS WELL SO I

03:31:33.947 --> 03:31:35.282
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT

03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:37.051
TO JUST CALL OUT. IN TERMS OF

03:31:37.117 --> 03:31:38.752
THE DEED I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU

03:31:38.819 --> 03:31:39.787
AND I THINK MANY OF OUR LOCAL

03:31:39.853 --> 03:31:41.255
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS LEAD THAT WE

03:31:41.321 --> 03:31:42.756
REALLY DO NEED TO REVISIT THE

03:31:42.823 --> 03:31:44.058
DATA INFRASTRUCTURE AND FIGURE

03:31:44.124 --> 03:31:45.459
OUT. A WAY TO EXPAND AND MAKE

03:31:45.526 --> 03:31:46.860
IT MORE ROBUST. THERE WAS

03:31:46.927 --> 03:31:47.928
NOTHING MORE CHALLENGING THAN

03:31:47.995 --> 03:31:50.597
TRYING TO- WALK THROUGH DATA

03:31:50.664 --> 03:31:52.499
CHALLENGES DURING THE PANDEMIC

03:31:52.566 --> 03:31:53.500
IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

03:31:53.567 --> 03:31:54.802
DATA WAS MATCHING AND WHERE

03:31:54.868 --> 03:31:56.070
THERE WERE DISCREPANCIES THAT

03:31:56.136 --> 03:31:57.371
WE WERE IDENTIFYING AND

03:31:57.438 --> 03:31:58.572
FIGURING OUT WHAT THE ISSUES

03:31:58.639 --> 03:32:00.074
WERE. AND INDEED IT TOOK UP A

03:32:00.140 --> 03:32:01.575
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND

03:32:01.642 --> 03:32:02.709
SO WE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU

03:32:02.776 --> 03:32:05.412
THERE- AND THE ONE THING THAT I

03:32:05.479 --> 03:32:06.580
WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT IN THE

03:32:06.647 --> 03:32:07.581
ASSESSMENT THAT WE'RE PUTTING

03:32:07.648 --> 03:32:09.750
FORWARD ARE PROPOSING THREE

03:32:09.817 --> 03:32:10.851
EIGHTY TWO FORTY. YOU KNOW IT'S

03:32:10.918 --> 03:32:12.019
NOT JUST WORKFORCE I THINK

03:32:12.086 --> 03:32:13.253
WORKFORCE IS A CRITICAL

03:32:13.320 --> 03:32:14.288
COMPONENT OF THAT BUT WE ALSO

03:32:14.354 --> 03:32:15.656
NEED TO ACCESS DATA

03:32:15.722 --> 03:32:17.257
INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO

03:32:17.324 --> 03:32:19.259
ASSESS AND EVALUATE OUR-

03:32:19.326 --> 03:32:20.894
LABORATORY CAPACITY SO I THINK

03:32:20.961 --> 03:32:22.596
ALL OF THOSE ARE THINGS THAT.

03:32:22.663 --> 03:32:24.364
WHILE WE SHOULD NOT WAIT TO

03:32:24.431 --> 03:32:25.966
INVEST IN THEM NOW WE SHOULD

03:32:26.033 --> 03:32:27.267
MAKESURE THAT WE HAVE A ROAD

03:32:27.334 --> 03:32:31.505
MAP FOR WHAT. WE WANT

03:32:31.572 --> 03:32:32.106
CALIFORNIA TO BE CALM AND MAKE

03:32:32.172 --> 03:32:32.706
SURE THEY WE ARE CONTINUE. TO

03:32:32.773 --> 03:32:33.340
MAKE. TO GET THEIR- AND THEN IN

03:32:33.407 --> 03:32:35.042
TERMS OF THE STAFF BEING- YOU

03:32:35.109 --> 03:32:37.311
YOU KNOW I THINK AS- MISS

03:32:37.377 --> 03:32:40.314
FINALE ADDRESS THIS. AND YES WE

03:32:40.380 --> 03:32:41.515
DEFINITELY WANT TO HAVE A

03:32:41.582 --> 03:32:43.050
SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN. ACT WHERE

03:32:43.117 --> 03:32:44.651
WE HAVE MUTUAL AID AND SO WE DO

03:32:44.718 --> 03:32:46.053
THE MEDICAL MUTUAL AID SYSTEM

03:32:46.120 --> 03:32:47.387
INCLUDES PUBLIC HEALTH WORK

03:32:47.454 --> 03:32:48.655
FORCE AND I THINK THAT.

03:32:48.722 --> 03:32:49.923
CRITICAL CHALLENGE THERE IS IF

03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:51.358
EVERYBODY'S UNDER RESOURCE THAT

03:32:51.425 --> 03:32:52.960
NOBODY CAN SHARE AND NOT IS

03:32:53.026 --> 03:32:54.228
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS

03:32:54.294 --> 03:32:55.963
AND SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

03:32:56.029 --> 03:32:57.798
COULD MAKE THE PUBLIC HEALTH

03:32:57.865 --> 03:32:59.466
WORKFORCE LOCALLY MORE ROBUST

03:32:59.533 --> 03:33:00.767
IN PLACE MORE PEOPLE THEY WILL

03:33:00.834 --> 03:33:02.603
HAVE LOCAL EXPERTISE THAT THEN

03:33:02.669 --> 03:33:03.837
COULD GO INTO ANOTHER

03:33:03.904 --> 03:33:05.606
JURISDICTION AND SUPPORT THEM.

03:33:05.672 --> 03:33:06.940
AND THEY ALREADY HAVE TRAINING

03:33:07.007 --> 03:33:08.775
AND PRACTICES THERE SO INSTEAD

03:33:08.842 --> 03:33:09.776
OF KEEPING THEM IN SOME. KIND

03:33:09.843 --> 03:33:12.579
OF RESERVE AREA WHICH- YOU KNOW

03:33:12.646 --> 03:33:13.347
I THINK GETTING MAKING SURE

03:33:13.413 --> 03:33:15.315
THAT THEY ARE IN. THE LOCAL

03:33:15.382 --> 03:33:16.583
HEALTH DEPARTMENT HELPING TO

03:33:16.650 --> 03:33:17.918
ADDRESS THE DAY TO DAY ISSUES

03:33:17.985 --> 03:33:19.553
AND THEN AT THE AVAILABLE FOR

03:33:19.620 --> 03:33:21.355
MUTUAL AID IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

03:33:21.421 --> 03:33:23.290
AND THEN- JUST ONE ECHO THE

03:33:23.357 --> 03:33:24.391
LABORATORY RESOURCES I THINK

03:33:24.458 --> 03:33:25.626
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

03:33:25.692 --> 03:33:27.694
REVISIT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE

03:33:27.761 --> 03:33:30.030
TIME. INVESTMENT IS UNTIL LABS

03:33:30.097 --> 03:33:31.098
AND WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE

03:33:31.165 --> 03:33:32.599
ACROSS THE STATE AND MANY YOU

03:33:32.666 --> 03:33:34.368
KNOW LOOK SMALLER JURISDICTIONS

03:33:34.434 --> 03:33:36.036
WHEN A LABORATORY CLOSED. AT

03:33:36.103 --> 03:33:37.704
THE POOL TOGETHER A CONTRACT

03:33:37.771 --> 03:33:39.606
WITH ONE LAB IN AND AS WE SEE

03:33:39.673 --> 03:33:41.141
IN KOBE THEN THE LAB THAT IS

03:33:41.208 --> 03:33:42.809
OVERSEEING. THE JURISDICTION

03:33:42.876 --> 03:33:43.944
OVERSEAS A LOT THEY HAVE TO

03:33:44.011 --> 03:33:46.346
PRIORITIZE THEIR SPECIMENS- IN

03:33:46.413 --> 03:33:47.614
IN THE EVENT OF SOMETHING BIG

03:33:47.681 --> 03:33:50.150
LIKE THIS AND THEN OTHERS ARE-

03:33:50.217 --> 03:33:52.119
THEIR PRIORITY BUT- THERE ARE

03:33:52.186 --> 03:33:53.587
SOME LADS THE END UP HAPPENING

03:33:53.654 --> 03:33:54.655
AND SO WHEN THE STATE STEPPED

03:33:54.721 --> 03:33:56.456
IN WITH THE VALENCIA BRANCH LAB

03:33:56.523 --> 03:33:57.524
THAT WAS. REALLY HELPFUL AND I

03:33:57.591 --> 03:33:58.892
THINK. WE SHOULD IT REALLY

03:33:58.959 --> 03:33:59.960
REVISIT AND TRY TO BE

03:34:00.027 --> 03:34:01.461
INNOVATIVE AND FIGURE OUT HOW

03:34:01.528 --> 03:34:02.663
WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

03:34:02.729 --> 03:34:04.064
ADEQUATE LABORATORY CAPACITY

03:34:04.131 --> 03:34:05.332
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I

03:34:05.399 --> 03:34:06.833
WOULD JUST. SORRY TO BE LONG

03:34:06.900 --> 03:34:07.668
WINDED THE LAST THING I WOULD

03:34:07.734 --> 03:34:09.336
JUST SAY IS. ALL OF THESE AREAS

03:34:09.403 --> 03:34:11.872
TAKE REALLY CRITICAL AND HIGHLY

03:34:11.939 --> 03:34:13.874
SKILLED PEOPLE SO AT AND THEN

03:34:13.941 --> 03:34:15.342
IT CONTEXT OF LABORATORIES FOR

03:34:15.409 --> 03:34:17.177
EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW LAB DIRECTORS

03:34:17.244 --> 03:34:19.046
ARE NOT EASY TO COME BY AND- WE

03:34:19.112 --> 03:34:20.647
REALLY NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE

03:34:20.714 --> 03:34:21.582
HAVE A PIPELINE SO THAT WE

03:34:21.648 --> 03:34:23.784
HAVE. THE STAFF BEING IN THE

03:34:23.850 --> 03:34:25.052
CAPABILITIES AND MAKING SURE

03:34:25.118 --> 03:34:31.024
THAT WE HAVE- QUALITY. SERVICES

03:34:31.091 --> 03:34:31.625
COMING OUT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS

03:34:31.692 --> 03:34:32.359
WELL. OKAY AND THEN- APPRECIATE

03:34:32.426 --> 03:34:33.627
THAT AND PERHAPS. WECHT PAN AND

03:34:33.694 --> 03:34:34.661
JUST PARTICULAR FOCUS ON. THE

03:34:34.728 --> 03:34:36.964
YOU'RE WILLINGNESS. TO AND YOUR

03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:38.165
DEPARTMENT WHEN DOES YOUR

03:34:38.232 --> 03:34:39.366
FELLOW HEALTH OFFICERS TO

03:34:39.433 --> 03:34:40.701
PARTNER AND TRYING TO. DEVELOP

03:34:40.767 --> 03:34:42.736
THESE PARTICULAR PLANS SO THAT

03:34:42.803 --> 03:34:44.738
QUICKLY. I THINK WE KEEP ASKING

03:34:44.805 --> 03:34:45.906
FOR PLANS AND I'VE I'VE I'VE

03:34:45.973 --> 03:34:47.341
SERVE INDICATED HAVE BEEN

03:34:47.407 --> 03:34:49.610
ASKING FOR EVERY YEAR BUT- WE

03:34:49.676 --> 03:34:51.645
BETTER HAVE ONE SOON SO WE CAN

03:34:51.712 --> 03:34:53.580
START. YOU KNOW MOVING ON THEM.

03:34:53.647 --> 03:34:55.782
THANK YOU YES THANK YOU AND I

03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:57.050
VERY MUCH AGREE WITH EVERYTHING

03:34:57.117 --> 03:34:59.987
THAT'S BEEN SAID SO FAR SO- WE

03:35:00.053 --> 03:35:01.622
WILL ABSOLUTELY AREN'T STAND

03:35:01.688 --> 03:35:03.957
READY TO. HELP AND COORDINATE

03:35:04.024 --> 03:35:05.726
AND I THINK A GOOD ASSESSMENT

03:35:05.792 --> 03:35:07.628
IS NEEDED WE REALLY NEED TO

03:35:07.694 --> 03:35:08.962
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS

03:35:09.029 --> 03:35:10.998
WHAT THE GAPS ARE IN. AND WHERE

03:35:11.064 --> 03:35:13.934
WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE OUR OUR-

03:35:14.001 --> 03:35:16.036
OUR INTERVENTIONS AND CHANGE

03:35:16.103 --> 03:35:20.007
THINGS SO. JUST TO SPEAK- OF

03:35:20.073 --> 03:35:22.309
THE LABORATORY ISSUE ENOUGH

03:35:22.376 --> 03:35:23.910
LABORATORIES YOU THAT SECOND-

03:35:23.977 --> 03:35:25.779
THE I. T. ISSUE REPORTS YOU

03:35:25.846 --> 03:35:27.481
KNOW ELECTRONIC LAB REPORTS SO

03:35:27.547 --> 03:35:29.549
NOT ALL WERE AND HOW MANY WERE

03:35:29.616 --> 03:35:31.718
THEY BY LAW PROVIDERS ALSO HAVE

03:35:31.785 --> 03:35:32.786
TO REPORT AND THEY DON'T REALLY

03:35:32.853 --> 03:35:34.154
HAVE AN EASY WAY TO COURT AND

03:35:34.221 --> 03:35:35.255
THAT WAS MOST OF THE PHONE

03:35:35.322 --> 03:35:36.890
CALLS AND FAXES WAS PROVIDERS

03:35:36.957 --> 03:35:38.892
REPORTING UNCOVERED NINETEEN

03:35:38.959 --> 03:35:40.127
TESTS ESPECIALLY THE ANTIGEN

03:35:40.193 --> 03:35:41.795
TEST THEMSELVES. I KNOW WE WERE

03:35:41.862 --> 03:35:42.663
WORKING ON WHAT WE CALL THE

03:35:42.729 --> 03:35:44.831
EACH CASE REPORTING SO DIRECT

03:35:44.898 --> 03:35:48.135
MESSAGING FROM- PH OURS INTO

03:35:48.201 --> 03:35:49.770
POWER READY AND THAT WAS MOVING

03:35:49.836 --> 03:35:51.171
FORWARD THAT PILOT COUNTIES IT

03:35:51.238 --> 03:35:52.639
WAS MOVING BUT THE PANDEMIC

03:35:52.706 --> 03:35:53.807
KIND OF STOP THE MOVEMENT BUT

03:35:53.874 --> 03:35:54.908
THAT SOME OF THE TECHNICAL

03:35:54.975 --> 03:35:56.810
SOLUTIONS THAT WE REALLY NEED

03:35:56.877 --> 03:35:59.079
TO IMPLEMENT TO- MORE

03:35:59.146 --> 03:36:01.715
OPERATIONALIZE OUR DATA. AND

03:36:01.782 --> 03:36:04.017
STREAMLINE WHAT WE'RE DOING-

03:36:04.084 --> 03:36:05.952
FOR THE LABORATORIES AGAINST

03:36:06.019 --> 03:36:07.087
YOU KNOW FUNDING IS ALWAYS AN

03:36:07.154 --> 03:36:09.323
ISSUE BUT MISGIVINGS JUST

03:36:09.389 --> 03:36:09.923
BROUGHT UP RIGHT THERE AT THE

03:36:09.990 --> 03:36:12.826
END- WE ARE ONE OF THE COUNTIES

03:36:12.893 --> 03:36:15.929
THE COSTAR LAB I BELIEVE IN TWO

03:36:15.996 --> 03:36:17.130
THOUSAND NINETEEN AND- IT WAS

03:36:17.197 --> 03:36:18.598
BECAUSE WE REALLY HADN'T BEEN

03:36:18.665 --> 03:36:19.766
ABLE TO EVER RECORD A LOT

03:36:19.833 --> 03:36:20.901
DIRECTOR I THINK WE HAVE A PART

03:36:20.967 --> 03:36:22.436
TIME RETIRED PERSON FOR ABOUT

03:36:22.502 --> 03:36:23.704
TEN YEARS IT WAS REALLY ALMOST

03:36:23.770 --> 03:36:25.872
MARCH I'M SPECIALIZED STAFFING

03:36:25.939 --> 03:36:27.607
THEN. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SAVING

03:36:27.674 --> 03:36:29.009
MONEY THIS WAS NOT ABOUT SAVING

03:36:29.076 --> 03:36:31.912
MONEY IT WAS ABOUT- TRYING TO

03:36:31.978 --> 03:36:33.480
CONSOLIDATE RESOURCES IN TRYING

03:36:33.547 --> 03:36:35.682
TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE BETWEEN

03:36:35.749 --> 03:36:36.983
TWO COUNTIES THAN AND THAT A

03:36:37.050 --> 03:36:38.819
SINGLE LAP AND IT SINGLE LABS

03:36:38.885 --> 03:36:41.054
IN BOTH COUNTIES HIMSELF REALLY

03:36:41.121 --> 03:36:41.922
I'M LOOKING AT A REGIONAL

03:36:41.988 --> 03:36:43.890
APPROACH IN A REGIONAL PLAN AND

03:36:43.957 --> 03:36:45.359
FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT WHAT

03:36:45.425 --> 03:36:47.194
WHAT IS REALLY NECESSARY IN

03:36:47.260 --> 03:36:48.428
ENSURING THAT THE STAFF IS

03:36:48.495 --> 03:36:50.931
AVAILABLE TO- IMPLEMENT THE

03:36:50.997 --> 03:36:52.833
PLAN AND WE STAND READY TO HELP

03:36:52.899 --> 03:36:54.735
ABSOLUTELY. OKAY THANK YOU AND

03:36:54.801 --> 03:36:56.970
THEN JUST ONE LAST QUESTION-

03:36:57.037 --> 03:36:58.538
FOR THE CD PH- WE TALK ABOUT

03:36:58.605 --> 03:37:00.707
VACCINE OUT REACH AND I KNOW

03:37:00.774 --> 03:37:01.274
YOU TALKED AND CERTAINLY WE

03:37:01.341 --> 03:37:04.378
NEED TO REACH OUT TO VARIOUS

03:37:04.444 --> 03:37:05.679
COMMITTEES COLOR WE

03:37:05.746 --> 03:37:07.080
PARTICULARLY NEED TO PRIORITIZE

03:37:07.147 --> 03:37:08.682
GETTING VACCINES I THINK

03:37:08.749 --> 03:37:09.616
VACCINES ACCESS IS ALSO

03:37:09.683 --> 03:37:12.819
CERTAINLY A HUGE ISSUE FOR. A

03:37:12.886 --> 03:37:13.453
GAME TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

03:37:13.520 --> 03:37:21.728
BUT LET'S ALSO BE BLOOD. THE A

03:37:21.795 --> 03:37:22.262
DATA RIGHT NOW SHE HAS THE

03:37:22.329 --> 03:37:22.863
BIGGEST AREA OF THE RESERVE-

03:37:22.929 --> 03:37:23.463
THE- HESITANCY OR ACT- WHAT

THAT HE AFTER PREMIUMS THE NEXT

04:18:02.967 --> 04:18:04.368
MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN

04:18:04.435 --> 04:18:06.370
WHETHER SOMEONE WILL ENROLL IS

04:18:06.437 --> 04:18:08.139
THAT OUT OF POCKET COSTS THAT

04:18:08.206 --> 04:18:09.540

BUMP IN ENROLLMENT NOT AS

04:18:31.863 --> 04:18:34.332
SIGNIFICANT AS REDUCING

04:24:01.926 --> 04:24:03.794
POLLING ROUGHLY THIRTY THREE

04:24:03.861 --> 04:24:05.462
PERCENT. OF SMALL BUSINESSES

04:24:05.529 --> 04:24:06.797
HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY HAD TO

04:24:06.864 --> 04:24:08.899
DROP. HEALTH INSURANCE WERE

04:24:08.966 --> 04:24:10.201
REDUCED HEALTH INSURANCE FOR

04:24:10.267 --> 04:24:11.969
THEMSELVES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES.

04:24:12.036 --> 04:24:13.604
AND THAT'S EVEN MORE ACUTE WHEN

04:24:13.671 --> 04:24:14.872
WE TALKED ON SPLURGE COLOR

04:24:14.939 --> 04:24:15.973
BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY

04:24:16.040 --> 04:24:17.208

04:24:18.375 --> 04:24:19.343
DROPPING HEALTH INSURANCE

04:24:19.410 --> 04:24:20.611
BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE OF COST

04:24:20.678 --> 04:24:22.313
OVER THIS PAST YEAR. AND EVEN

04:24:22.379 --> 04:24:24.615
LOOKING FORWARD ROUGHLY 16% OF

04:24:24.682 --> 04:24:26.016
BUSINESSES I THINKING THAT THEY

04:24:26.083 --> 04:24:27.785
MIGHT HAVE TO DO THAT- AND

04:24:27.851 --> 04:24:29.720
AGAIN THAT IS EVEN MORE ACUTE.

04:24:29.787 --> 04:24:30.654

04:24:35.960 --> 04:24:37.261
HAVE NOT RETURNED TO PRE

04:24:37.328 --> 04:24:39.330

RETURN TO THEIR PLACE OF

04:24:42.933 --> 04:24:44.235
BUSINESS THE POTENTIALLY BE

04:24:44.301 --> 04:24:45.469
ABLE TO ACCESS SOME SORT OF

04:24:45.536 --> 04:24:47.871
SMALL GROUP PLAN- AND THE LAST

04:24:47.938 --> 04:24:48.939
PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT'S

04:24:49.006 --> 04:24:49.873
REALLY CRITICAL AS WE THINK

04:24:49.940 --> 04:24:51.008
ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT

04:24:51.075 --> 04:24:51.375
