SO IN SACRAMENTO FRESNO CONCORD RIVERSIDE READING EUREKA COACHELLA AND SAN DIEGO. AND WE'RE NOT DONE. THEY WERE GOING TO BE SHARING WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED. UP TO DATE. WE'VE LEARNED FROM FROM PREVIOUS HEARINGS THAT LISTEN TO YOUR STORIES IS THE MOST VALUABLE THING WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY. WE HAVE SET ASIDE AMPLE TIME AT THE END OF THE HEARING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT TO HEAR FROM YOU. OVER THE PAST YEAR THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AN ONLINE SURVEY ABOUT REGIONAL CENTERS. AT EACH HEARING I HAVE ENCOURAGED EVERYONE TO COMPLETE THE SURVEY WHICH CAN BE FOUND ONLINE ARE COMMITTEE WEBSITE. AT HE CONCLUSION OF LAST YEAR'S HEARINGS WE SUBMITTED THE ANONYMOUS DATA TO THE STATE LIBRARY'S CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU. AFTER READING THROUGH THE REPORT WE DISCOVER THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. AND TRUST ME. WE WILL GET THERE. THERE ARE COPIES OF THE SURVEY RESULTS AVAILABLE TODAY IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM. ALSO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO INFORMED. SO OKAY LET'S GET STARTED WE WILL BEGIN THIS HEARING WITH A PRESENTATION BY DOCTOR TONYA BUSY SENIOR POLICY ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU. DOCTOR. AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR TIRELESS WORK. PLEASE PRESENT WE READY. TESTING OKAY. THANK YOU CHAIR FRAZIER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE INVITATION AND STAFF FOR THE INVITATION AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU HERE TODAY. I WILL KEEP MY REMARKS AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS NOW OR AFTER THE HEARING. MY NAME IS DOCTOR TONYA DE LINDSEY AND I AM A SENIOR RESEARCHER AT THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU. WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY. I AM ALSO A PROFESSOR RESEARCH METHODS AND STATISTICS WE CSU CHICO WHERE I TEACH PART TIME AS A LECTURER. CHAIR FRAZIER STAFF ASK THE RESEARCH BUREAU TO ANALYZE SURVEY DATA. THEIR OFFICE COLLECTED ONLINE AND IT'S SEVEN HEARINGS OF THIS COMMITTEE FROM OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN. TO DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN. THE SURVEY SOUGHT INFORMATION FROM CLIENTS CARE GIVERS AND PARENTS WHO UTILIZE CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES. WE SUBMITTED OUR FINAL MEMORANDUM. WITH SURVEY RESULTS JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY. THE SURVEY DATA WERE COLLECTED USINGA CONVENIENCE DATA COLLECTION METHOD WHICH MEANS THE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM ANYONE WHO WANTED TO FILL OUT THE SURVEY THERE WAS NOT A SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING METHOD INVOLVED IN DATA COLLECTION. THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER SIR SURVEY DATA COMES FROM A RANDOM SAMPLE RATHER THAN A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE BECAUSE RANDOM SAMPLING ALLOWS FOR STATISTICAL RESULTS. FROM A SURVEY TO BE GENERALIZED AS REPRESENTING THE POPULATION STUDY. IDEALLY THE SURVEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO A RANDOM SAMPLE OF ALL CLIENTS CARE GIVERS AND PARENTS OF REGIONAL CENTERS. WELL STATISTICAL RESULTS FROM SURVEYS- FROM THIS SURVEY CANNOT BE GENERALIZED AS REPRESENTING ALL CLIENTS CARE GIVERS AND PARENTS WHO UTILIZE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. IT IS A VALID REPRESENTATION OF THE OPINIONS AND THOUGHTS OF THOSE WHO DID COMPLETE THE SURVEY. CONVENIENCE SAMPLING RESULTS MAKE US AWARE OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO SURVEY RESPONDENTS AND CAN OFFER GUIDANCE AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO THE LARGER POPULATION. THERE WERE A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO RESPONSES TO THE SURVEY. AND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE OR ABOUT 35% COMPLETED ALL OF THE QUANTIFIABLE QUESTIONS. WE ANALYZED ONLY THOSE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE RESPONSES FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES FOR THREE REASONS. ONE BECAUSE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WAS NOT COLLECTED WE COULD NOT USE ADDITIONAL METHODS TO PREDICT THE MISSING DATA. TO RESULTS ARE OFTEN IN RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER. OFTEN WHEN VIEWING STATISTICAL RESULTS COMPARISONS ARE MADE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE'S ANSWERS TO SIMILAR QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE ASKING ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE TO RANK EXPERIENCE WITH CASE WORKERS BUT ASKING ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO SAY HOW LONG IT TAKES. A CARE GIVER TO RETURN A CALL IS NOT COMPARABLE. A READER MIGHT MISS THAT IT IS TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE BEING COMPARED AND MAKING A RUN ITS CONCLUSION. THREE IN ADDITION COMPARING SATISFACTION ACROSS REGIONAL CENTERS WHEN SOME RESPONDENTS FROM ONE REGIONAL CENTER ANSWER ONE QUESTION BUT NOT ANOTHER. DOES NOT LEND ITSELF TO A FAIR COMPARISON. THE INDICES WE CONSTRUCTED FROM RESPONDENTS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ASKING THEM TO RANK THEIR CENTER SERVICES AND SERVICE PROVISION. ARE BASED ON THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE COMPLETED SURVEYS. OVER HALF OF THE RESPONDENTS REPORTED USING THE SAN DIEGO INLAND ALTA EAST BAY AND VALLEY MOUNTAIN REGIONAL CENTERS. NOT REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE WAS ANYONE FROM SAN GABRIEL OUR POMONA ARE SAN GABRIEL POMONA. IN THE OVERALL RANKING ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN RESPONDENTS FROM FRANK T. LANHAM AND RATED SERVICES AND SERVICE PROVISION THEY'RE HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER REGIONAL CENTER. AND OVERALL THE RESPONDENTS FROM FRANKIE LANA MEN KERN VALLEY VALLEY MOUNTAIN. REDWOOD COAST SAN DIEGO ALTA EAST BAY AND GOLDEN GATE RANGE THEIR REGIONAL CENTERS ABOVE THE AVERAGE RATING FOR ALL CENTERS. IT MAY BE USEFUL MOVING FORWARD TO LOOK FURTHER INTO THESE LOCATIONS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MADE SOME PEOPLE RANK THESE CENTERS HIGHLY. AND FOR THOSE RESPONDENTS WHO ASKED FOR FOLLOW AT AN PROVIDED CONTACT INFORMATION MORE IN DEPTH INFORMATION COULD BE COLLECTED IF NEEDED. IN ADDITION TO THOSE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE COMPLETED SURVEYS ANALYZED USING STATISTICAL SUMMARIES. FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHT NEARLY AND EIGHTY RESPONDENTS LEFT SOMETIMES LENGTHY COMMENTS IN ANSWER TO AN OPEN ENDED QUESTION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR INTERACTION WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. IT IS TO THESE QUALITATIVE DATA I TURN TO NOW TO SHARE THE RESULTS OF A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THOSE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHT COMMENTS. A THEMATIC ANALYSIS UNLIKE STATISTICS OFFERS MORE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED EXPERIENCES. SOME OF THE COMMENTS FORTY FIVE WERE VERY POSITIVE AND EIGHTY WERE MIXED AND WE TOOK THOSE TO BE INSTRUCTIVE OF WHAT RESPONDENTS WANT TO SEE MORE OF. THERE WERE FOUR POSITIVE THEMES THAT EMERGED FROM THE ANALYSIS. FIRST CLIENT CARE GIVERS AND PARENTS EMPHASIZED HOW IMPORTANT SERVICES IMPROPER ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS ARE TO THEIR HIGH SATISFACTION WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. LISTEN TO WHAT ONE RESPONDENT ROAD AS THEY RELATE THEIR STRUGGLE WITH GETTING A DIAGNOSIS FOR THEIR DAUGHTER UNTIL A REGIONAL CENTER FINALLY HELPED THEM. MY CHILD SHE THEY SAID AGE TWENTY FIVE WAS JUST APPROVED FOR SERVICES WITHIN THE LAST MONTH. IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY OVERWHELMING FOR ME STRUGGLING ON MY OWN ALL THESE YEARS NEVER HAVING RECEIVED AN APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSIS FROM A MEDICAL DOCTOR OR THERAPIST OR SCHOOL DISTRICT. SHE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH SEVERAL OTHER DISORDERS SINCE THE AGE OF NINE. SO THE DIAGNOSIS REALLY HELPS TO UNDERSTAND HER INABILITY TO FUNCTION IN LIFE. I FEEL MUCH BETTER THAN I AM NOW GETTING HELP THE PEOPLE THAT REDWOOD COAST REGIONAL CENTER HAVE BEEN GREAT. THEY SAID. SECOND SOME RESPONDENTS DESCRIBED FEELING LIKE FAMILY WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND REPORT WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM. BUILDING CLOSE FAMILY LIKE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PEOPLE REGIONAL CENTER SERVE IS APPRECIATED BY THOSE WHO HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. THIRD RESPONDENTS INDICATED THEY APPRECIATE MEETING GOALS THROUGH GUIDANCE TEAM WORK AND SUPPORT. CLIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES REPORT BEING GOAL ORIENTED AND APPRECIATING WHEN REGIONAL CENTER STAFF HELP THEM REACH THEIR GOALS. AND FINALLY COMMUNICATION IS KEY. FOR POSITIVE INTERACTIONS WITH REGIONAL CENTERS RESPONDENTS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE CHANGING AND GETTING BETTER AT THINGS THEY LIKE REGIONAL CENTERS TO DO SUCH AS LISTEN RESPOND AND SHARE INFORMATION. IN COMPARISON TO THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE COMMENTS THAT POSITIVE OR MIXED COMMENTS. RESPONDENTS ROAD APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY NEGATIVE COMMENTS WE FOUND THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS TO GROUP AROUND THE FOLLOWING SIX THEMES THAT SUGGEST NEEDED CHANGES FROM THE RESPONDENTS POINTS OF VIEW. ONE RESPONDENTS BELIEVE REGIONAL CENTERS COULD IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF ACCURATE INFORMATION IN A TIMELY AN CONSISTENT MANNER. SOME RESPONDENTS INDICATED THEY ARE GIVEN INCORRECT INFORMATION OR LEADS TO THAT SOME STAFF HAVE PURPOSELY NOT GIVEN THEM THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. FOR EXAMPLE SOMEWHERE MORE GENERAL BY WRITING THINGS LIKE I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES PROVIDED TO ALL AND A CONSISTENT LIST OF AVAILABLE SERVICES. OTHERS WERE VERY SPECIFIC AND WROTE THINGS SUCH AS I SUGGEST THAT REGIONAL CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH HOSPITALS TO EDUCATE NEW PARENTS OF BABIES BORN WITH DISABILITIES OF THEIR EXISTENCE. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO NEW RESIDENT PACKAGES AN IN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE COMMUNICATE SO NO ONE IS LEFT OUT. THE SECOND THEME IN THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS. IS REGIONAL CENTERS NEED MORE AND SKILLED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE AND CARING STAFF AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. MANY OF THE RESPONDENTS COMMENTED ABOUT HIGH STAFF TURNOVER AND THE FRUSTRATION OF FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE TO START OVER EVERY TIME THEY RECEIVE A NEW CASE WORKER. RESPONDENTS LIKE THIS ONE COMMENTED ON THE CASE LOADS AND PAY FOR THE STAFF. THEY SAID SINCE OUR CASE WORKER HAS I BELIEVE OVER A HUNDRED CLIENTS I WOULD LIKE G. G. R. C. TO HIRE MORE CASE WORKERS. AND ANOTHER WROTE DDS SHOULD RAISE THE STANDARDS OF TRAINING AND RATES OF PAY IN ORDER TO CREATE A STABLE RELIABLE AND WELL TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND THEY THINK VENDORS SHOULD BE PAID MORE THIS PERSON WROTE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT FUNDING IS INCREASED FOR ALL VENDORS INVOLVED WITH THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BIG SCRAPE AND WONDER WHAT MORE WE COULD BE DOING FOR SPECIAL LEFT ONCE. THEN THERE ARE FAMILIES TO GET NOTHING BECAUSE THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THE EXISTENCE AND PROCESS OF REGIONAL CENTERS AND THEIR SERVICES. THE THIRD THEME IS THAT PAYMENTS AND FUNDING GENERALLY. ARE CITED AS PROBLEMS BY RESPONDENTS. SOME REPORTED NOT BEING REIMBURSED WELL OTHER SUGGESTED THE OVERALL SYSTEM NEEDED NEEDS MORE FUNDING. WARS OR A COMPLETE OVERHAUL. ONE RESPONDENT EVEN SUGGESTED ELIMINATING REGIONAL CENTERS. WHILE OTHER SAID THAT MORE MONEY OR FUNDING COULD HELP AND WROTE IT IS NOT MY IMPRESSION THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER IS THE PROBLEM WHERE THERE ARE ISSUES BUT THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY IN THE SYSTEM. PROGRAMS THAT CLOSED AFTER ALL THE BUDGET CUTS HAVE NOT BEEN REPLACED AND THERE ARE JUST NOT ENOUGH OPENINGS FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS NEEDS. THE FOUR THEME. IS THAT RESPONDENTS WROTE THAT REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH OVERSIGHT. POLICY IN LAW NEED TO BE EXAMINED AND FOLLOWED. SEVERAL RESPONDENTS EXPRESSED A NEED FOR MORE OVERSIGHT OF THEIR REGIONAL CENTER AND REPORTED EXERTING GREAT PERSONAL EFFORT. TO ENSURE REGIONAL CENTER COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS SUCH AS THE FRANK THE LANHAM ACT. ONE RESPOND IT READ AT LENGTH I KEEP IT SHOR. THE REGIONAL CENTER DEMONSTRATES A DISREGARD FOR CLIENTS RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW THEY SAID. THEY REFUSE TO FOLLOW THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAWJUDGE'S RULING IN MY SISTER'S FAIR HEARING CASE AND THERE IS LITTLE I CAN DO ABOUT IT. THE R. C. ABUSES THEIR POWER AND IS NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYBODY IT IS TIME FOR REFORM. AND THE FIFTEEN IS THAT RESPONDENTS BELIEVE A ACCESS TO SERVICES NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED. RESPONDENTS ASKED FOR MORE RESPITE CARE FINANCIAL LEGAL TRANSPORTATION EMERGENCY PLACEMENTS AND SERVICES EMPLOYMENT LONG TERM CARE AND HOUSING SERVICES. SOME RESPONDENTS WANT SERVICES EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THINGS SUCH AS SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME. AND FINALLY A THEME THAT SURFACED IS CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL BIAS IN THE AWARD AND DELIVERY OF SERVICES SOME RESPONDENTS REPORTED THAT QUOTE HISPANIC NON WHITE AND NON ENGLISH SPEAKER CLIENTS AND QUOTE. HAVE A PARTICULARLY TOUGH TIME GETTING SERVICES. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS VALUABLE EVEN FROM A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE IN FUTURE SURVEYS IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO KNOW IF THE RESPONDENT AS A CLIENT CARE GIVER APPARENT. AND TO CAREFULLY CHOOSE THE SAMPLE TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LARGER POPULATION OF REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS. AS WELL AS TO STRUCTURE QUESTIONS SO THE RESPONDENTS ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS. THAT SAID THE INFORMATION GARNERED FROM THE CURRENT SURVEY MAY BE INSTRUCTIVE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. TO SUMMARIZE THE THEMATIC ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF WHAT RESPONDENTS INDICATED COULD HELP IMPROVE HOW REGIONAL CENTERS SERVE CLIENTS CARE GIVERS AND PARENTS ONE. EXAMINE AND OVERSEE PROCESS SEES AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE OVER TIME. TO EXAMINE OVERSEE AND POSSIBLY CHANGE THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF READ REGIONAL CENTERS. THREE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES. FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR VENDORS AND SERVICES. FIVE INCREASE FUNDING FOR STAFF AND TRAINING TO RETAIN EXPERIENCED STAFF. SIX IDENTIFY WAYS TO COORDINATE INFORMATION AND ACCESS. MAKE MORE SEVEN AND LAST MAKE MORE INFORMATION EASILY AVAILABLE FOR CLIENTS PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS WE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE- DR. THANK YOU GREAT REPORT A LOT OF INFORMATION- JUST QUICKLY REGARDING THE INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES AVAILABLE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WAS KIND OF AN OVERRIDING THING ABOUT HIS COMMENTS- HOW MUCH DO THEY DO ONLINE I MEAN IS THERE WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS CAN THE FAMILIES GO ONLINE AND GET INFORMATION OR IS THAT NOT AN OPTION IT DIDN'T FROM JUST THE COMMENTS I READ THEY DID NOT MENTION GOING ONLINE THEY ACTUALLY ASKED FOR MORE SERVICES TO BE AVAILABLE ON ONLINE SUCH AS MENUS. OKAY YEAH BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS OF NOTES THAT NOT KNOWING ABOUT SERVICES OR THAT THEY NEED TO TRAVEL SOME DISTANCE IN ORDER TO GET THE GET THE SERVICES THEY GET INFORMATION EVEN THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MIGHT THE OTHER THING IS WAS IS THERE A WAY TO TELL FROM THE RESPONSES IF- SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE RESPONSES WERE RELATIVE TO A CERTAIN CENTER. YOU KNOW VAST SAYS JUST ALL OVER THE STATE IT THAT I COULDN'T I COULDN'T SPEAK TO NO I COULDN'T MATCH THE ALL THOSE COMMENTS THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY EVEN WRITE THE CENTER NECESSARILY IN FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHT COMMENTS YEAH THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DOCTOR. WHAT WOULD YOU SEE. OUR FOR FUTURE SURVEYS HAVE YOU TOGETHER ARE YOU ABOUT THAT TO MAKE IT. SO THAT THE SURVEY THIS IS GOOD IN FOR. AS POINTED OUT OF NEW TO OUR PARTICULAR SO. TO IMPROVE WHAT YOU SUGGEST WE DO IS IT FOR SURVEYS FOR THIS. IF THERE WERE AND NOW SURVEY EVEN A PARTICULAR CENTER I THINK THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO IS TO HAVE A FULL LIST OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE TO CONTACT AND THEN GET A RANDOM SAMPLE FROM THOSE PEOPLE. BUT WHATEVER YOU WOULD WANT TO ASK THEM. OKAY SO BASICALLY GO THROUGH THE CENTERS AND ASK WHAT THEY THINK WOULD BE AND GET A LIST OF WHO THEY ARE OR WHO THEY'RE PROVIDING GET THE CONTACT LIST IF WITH A PROVIDING CARE FOR. IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE- THE PERSON GETTING CARE AS WELL AS THE PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS. WOULD START WITH A COMPLETE LIST THERE OKAY ARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT. VETERANS IF YOU SO VERY MUCH AD I KNOW THIS WAS A ON A TASK OF COMPILING ALL OF THIS DIFFERENT IF COME IN- IT OVER ONE MY STAFF YOU ACTUALLY SAVE THE DAY YEAH. NO AND AGAIN WE HAD THIS COMMITTEE TO. A HEARING TO PUT TOGETHER A IN THIS WAS JUST ONE OF THE LARGEST PARTS THAT- YOUR EXPERTISE CAME AND SO VERY HANDY AND WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR HELP AND- AND YOUR SUGGESTIONS ARE WARRANTED WILL WORK WITH EDS AND REGIONAL CENTERS TO. OR MORE COMPREHENSIVE- APPROACH PER REGIONAL CENTER. THANK YOU WE'RE HAPPY TO SERVE. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. TWO NOW THAT. OF THIS WALL HIS HOUSE IS GONNA ASK IF YOU WANT TO SAVE REAL I DIDN'T BOTH MEMBERS HAD A CHANCE SOMETHING I WONDERED KNOWLEDGE PLEASE THANK YOU KNOW WAS A GOOD ENDEAVOR TO DO THE SURVEY- I ACTUALLY DID A COUPLE OF ARTICLES IN MY LOCAL NEWSPAPERS- WITH THE SURVEY LINK SO THAT YOU KNOW TO GET OUT THERE MORE AND I THINK WE DID IT TWICE OVER THE COURSE OF THE TIME. SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPED AND YOU KNOW IF WE DO SOMETHING ELSE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET IT OUT YOU KNOW AND ARE IN NO DISTRICTS SO. I WANT YOU TO THANK EACH AND EVERY YOU AGAIN THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN LEVELS SELECT COMMITTEES WERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY. TAKE THE TIME TO SHOW UP BECAUSE WE DON'T LEGISLATORS.AND BUT IT IS ON A LISTENING- OPPORTUNITY TO. OF HOW WE CAN BETTER SERVE THE POPULATIONS OF AGAIN. HERE'S YOUR CHANCE THANK YOU. WE MOVE ON TO A PERRANCE PURSED PANEL DISCUSSION WITH READY NOT MAKING BILL AND ALEXIS TO RUN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RANDY NOT I AM A PARENT OF A WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING HIS NAME IS PRESLEY NOT AND HE QUICKLY INFORMED ME THAT HE COULD NOT JOIN ME TODAY BECAUSE HE WOULD MISS SCHOOL AND THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE. YOU GET IT ZERO. OUT BUT I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER. AND ACTUALLY SOME OF YOU IN MY PROFESSIONAL THINGS I'VE EITHER LOBBIED YOU ON HOUSING OR WATER OR FOR THE CITY SACRAMENTO. I AM IN THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE BY TRADE- NOT MORE THOUGH- BUT- NOT EVERYBODY IS MY SON IS A SUCCESS STORY WHEN WE WERE WHEN HE WAS TWO. WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL CHILD WOULD NEVER SPEAK NEVER POTTY TRAIN WE SHOULD SET UP A SUPPORTED LIVING ACCOUNT AND LET HIM AS HE IS. AND WE WENT AHEAD AND WENT TO THE REGIONAL CENTER AND- DIGESTED ALL OF THIS WELL- HE DOESN'T SHUT UP. HE'S PERFECTLY POTTY TRAINED AND HE WANTS TO BE STEPHEN COLE BEAR OR TREVOR NOAH. SO WE'RE FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THAT THAT SAID. THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES. WERE KEY TO HIS. AND AS HE GETS OLDER WE ARE ONCE AGAIN AT A CROSSROADS WHERE THINGS ARE NOT TYPICAL. NOW WHAT IS DEFINITELY NOT TYPICAL IS THAT ONCE MY SON WAS DIAGNOSED I GOT APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AND LATER BY GOVERNOR BROWN. TO THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES I SAT ON THE áREA BOARD I BECAME VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE SO OF COURSE I KNEW EVERYTHING. I DON'T I ENGLISH IS MY FIRST LANGUAGE I'M NOT A PERSON OF COLOR. I DID NOT NEED MEDI CAL I DID NOT HAVE OTHER CHILDREN TO WORRY ABOUT NOR A MINIMUM WAGE JOB. THEY KEPT ME FROM CONSTANTLY ADVOCATING- MY SON IS A CLIENT AT- ALTER REGIONAL CENTER. THE DIFFERENCE IN ALTHOUGH OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IS PHENOMENAL- IT IN ITS IMPROVEMENT. IN MY EXPERIENCE HOWEVER FOR THE HUNDRED PLUS FAMILIES- FOR WHOM I ATTENDED EITHER I EAT PEAS AT THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS I. P. P.'S. AT ALL THE I MEET THE MAN TRADER JOE'S THEY'RE MY FRIENDS COUSINS BROTHERS CHILD I GO JUST TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE UNIVERSE THAT THE ORIGINAL DIAGNOSIS WAS NOT CORRECT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHO TO CALL MR BUT NAY- IT USED TO BE THAT WE HAD ADVOCATES AT THE AREA BOARDS. WHO WOULD COME IN AND STEP IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NO LONGER IS AVAILABLE- IF I WERE YOU KNOW IF I WERE TO SAY. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS THE COMMUNICATION IS ABSOLUTELY KEY. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A WATCHDOG THESE ARE STILL NON PROFITS PROVIDING STATE SERVICES. AND THAT PIECE IS MISSING. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER LINKAGE BETWEEN. SCHOOL BOARDS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. POLICY IN EDUCATION AND POLICY IN THE ID DE AREA BECAUSE BECAUSE- WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS I SEEM THAN ANY. IS SCHOOL SAYING THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OF THAT AND THEN THE REGIONAL SO IS NO THIS. IN CHARGE OF THAT. AND DURING THAT TIME THAT CHILD IS LOSING SERVICES AND LOSING A CHANCE. TO BE A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY IN THE ONLY STATE WITH AN ENTITLEMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. SO I WOULD- AGAIN REITERATE EVERYTHING WE'VE HEARD FROM FROM THE SURVEY BUT ALSO LOOK TO A WAY TO RESOLVE THIS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY'S GETTING. A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SERVICES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION I'M SORRY I'M QUITE SAVVY THE LOT THE WEBSITE IS UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S UNUSABLE IT DOESN'T HELP YOU AND YOU DON'T KNOW- SO THE ALSO HAVING A REGIONAL CENTER PERSON AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN GENERAL WOULD BE HUGE TO CHECK THEM ON WHEN THEY CLAIM THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S THAT BELONGS. OUT WITH THE DISTRICT VERSES THE RC AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST PLACES THIS HITS IS WITH OUR LARGEST POPULATION WHICH YOUR KIDS ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. BECAUSE THERE IS IT IS THE NEWEST THING THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND IT IS THE MOST THING THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. AND IT IS THE EASIEST PLACE FOR KIDS TO GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE BECAUSE EVERYTHING SEEMS ACADEMIC OR EVERYTHING SEEMS. YOU'RE RELATED TO LIFE SKILLS THERE'S GRAY AREAS SO WITH THAT- I WOULD. RICK THAT WE LOOK AT REDUCING MISTER FRAZIER BILL FROM LACK YEAR WE GIVE OF MORE POWER THE PARENTS MORE POWERS. TO THE AREA BOARDS TO KIND OF BALANCE THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OF COURSE THE TRAINING I OF THE BEST SERVICE COORDINATOR IN THE WORLD SHE WOULD GET FIRED IF I SAID OUT LOUD THAT SHE IS MANAGED TO STAY WITH MY SON SINCE BEFORE USED TO. ANY SEVENTEEN NOW THAT'S A VERY SPECIAL HUMAN BEING I'M VERY FORTUNATE. OTHER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT AND THAT'S NOT OKAY. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. MS BELL. I'M AN ANALYST RANDI'S HELP HERE REAL QUICK. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR WHEN YOU PUT A FACE WITH THE NAME OF. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU CHAIR FOR THE INVITED ME TO THAT TOO- FOR INVITING ME AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I APOLOGIZE THIS IS DEEPLY PERSONALLY FEEL SILLY CRYING. AS I'VE TALKED TO THOUSAND OF LITTLE LEAGUERS AND THIS JUST SOMEHOW I THINK THIS. I'M GO FIGURE. OKAY SO I'M I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY UNIVERSE THE USER TO THE A MOST PART MEN IN MY WORLD.

I AM INCREDIBLY PROUD OF BOTH MY BOYS. WHEN DEREK WAS BORN IN IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED I MADE THE PROMISE TO BOTH BOYS THAT I WOULD SECURE WHATEVER SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE AND HAVE SERVICES IN PLACE SO WHAT WHEN THE CARE TRANSFERS FROM ME TO THE ARC THEY BOTH WOULD BE IN GOOD SHAPE. ASSEMBLY FRAZIER. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I SEE HER BEFORE YOU BROKEN. INITIALLY AND TO ANNOUNCE ALLOW THE I FAILED. REFERRED TO REGIONAL CENTER AT AGE DEAR RECEIVED EARLIER SERVICES AT THE WAY CENTER. AT THE PITTSBURGH OKAY. UNABLE WALK WE WOULDN'T BE BROKEN SINCE IN THE CASE HOMELESS EVERY INTO THE GATES HIS CLASS. THERE HE RECEIVED MUCH NEEDED SOME AND GUIDANCE STOP AS- DONE BY ALL REELING FOR. THE PROCESS WAS OVER ONE A FAST THE CURRENT OF CASE. EARLY IN A AND THE BILL SERVICES MADE MY HEAD SPIN. DAY TO DAY CAN ON TEACHING ONE WELL BUT IT BECAME VERY CLEAR. ALONG WITH LENGTHY MEDICAL DIED AND EDUCATE SUPPORT. THAT LEARNING TO THE REASONING REGIONAL SYSTEM WAS GOING TO BE A WHOLE NOTHER BEAST I WAS ASKED QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT DO I WANT FOR MY CHILD. WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO MY CHILD MY IMMEDIATE REACTION FINANCES CAME EASY I WANT HIM TO BE LOVED AND I WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY. OKAY CAME THE REPLY A SERVICE PLAN WAS WRITTEN AND WE WERE SENT ON OUR WAY. I WAS WONDERING WHAT IT HAPPENED EVERYONE WAS NICE ENOUGH. BUT I WAS LEFT WITH THE THING PCKING STOMACH. THAT I JUST MISSED SOMETHING BIG. BUT I HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH. THAT THERE WAS MAYBE SHORT MORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR SOMEHOW. WHAT MORE IS THERE OTHER THAN LEVIN HAPPINESS. I WOULD PAINFULLY LEARNED THAT THERE WAS MUCH MUCH MORE. GENTLE COACHING FROM STAFF AND SHE'S RETIRED NOW SO I CAN SAY THIS BUT EVEN MISS LANKFORD HERSELF TAKING HER DIRECTOR HAD OFF. AND INSTEAD SPEAKING TO WAS ME TO HIS MOM SPEAKING TO ME AS A MOM OPEN MY EYES ALL THE THINGS I NEED TO ASK. THAT I HAD TO ASK FOR OR DEREK WOULDN'T EVEN BEGIN TO RECEIVE A FRACTION OF WHAT HE NEEDED. VERY QUICKLY I LEARNED THAT NO ONE NO ONE WAS GOING TO HELP ME KNOW WHAT HE TRULY NEEDED. HOW COULD THAT BE ISN'T THAT WITH THIS CASE MEASURE WAS FOR TO HELP GUIDE US. ALWAYS A BELIEVER AND REYES TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION WHEN YOU PRESENT A PROBLEM. I AM BROUGHT TO STOPS TENSION THE FILTH MERE FEET AWAY FROM THE CHILDREN THAT ALL CAME TO THE EARLY INTERVENTION CLASS. NO ONE TOOK ME SERIOUSLY UNTIL AFTER THE WITNESS ME DAILY FOR A WEEK. BACKING UP THE BOTTLES AND NEEDLES WELL THE CHILDREN WERE IN SCHOOL. LITTLE DID I KNOW AT THE TIME TAKING ACTION WHEN NO ONE ELSE WOULD BECAME A RESOUNDING THEME OF MY LIFE. FAST FORWARD TO POP SCHOOL. THE INTERNET OF IP SCHOOL C. NOT BE REGIONAL SERVER. EVEN MORE AND WORKING WITH THE CASE MANAGER THE SAID NO OR I DON'T KNOW MORE THAN SHE EVER SAID YES. FRUSTRATIONS MOUNTED THIS A SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL POINT TO THE REGIONAL CENTER AND REGIONAL CENTER WITH POINT BACK. SPRINKLING MOUNTING HEALTH ISSUES AND MULTIPLE DOCTORS IT WAS LIKE THREE FULL TIME JOBS. IN THERE ARE WOVEN AMONG THE SMALL QUIET MOMENTS WE TRIED TO CELEBRATE JUST BE A KID. YEAR AFTER YEAR OLD BY NO GUIDANCE FROM REGIONAL CENTER NO EFFECTIVE MEANINGFUL SERVICES I REMEMBER THAT FEELING IT WAS BACK. IT WAS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE THE MORE EDUCATED MYSELF AND THE MORE I CONNECTED WITH PARENTS LIKE ME THE MORE I LEARNED MY CASE MANAGER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT MY SON NEEDED. SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS AVAILABLE OR HOW TO CHECK. I JUST GOT NO AND I DON'T KNOW. WELL AT THIS POINT I HAD INVOLVED AS A PARENT IN ADDITION TO BECOMING A MEDICAL EXPERT IN ALL AREAS MY SON NEEDED I REALLY CALIFORNIA AT CODE AT NIGHT I SAID ENOUGH. I WASN'T GOING TO DO THE CASE MANAGERS JOB AS WELL. SO I REQUEST HER SUPERVISOR AN ASPIRIN NEW MORE EXPERIENCED REGIONAL CENTER MANAGER A REGIONAL CENTER CASE MANAGER. IT WASN'T FOR LACK OF. BEING A NICE PERSON BUT IT WAS FOR LACK OF EXPERIENCE AND I NEED TO SOMEONE WHO KNEW MORE. YOU WOULD THOUGHT THAT I WAS SEEKING TO AND FROM THE QUEEN MOTHER HERSELF MULTIPLE MEETINGS IN AND DURING THREATS OF ELIMINATION OF SERVICES I WAS FINALLY ASSIGNED ANOTHER CASE MANAGER. THAT CASE MEASURES THE NEW. WAS LEERY OF ME. I'VE BEEN LABELED THAT PARENTS IT TOOK ONE CANDID SIT DOWN MEETING WITH HER IN PERSON AND SHE COMPLETELY GOT THE PICTURE. SERVICES THAT ENSUED DIAPERS FOR HIS INCONTINENCE IN HOME THERAPY RESPITE. BY THAT TIME WHEN SERVICES BY WE ARRIVED. WE HAVE A BELLY FOR THREE YEARS. FOR THE NEXT YEAR TO. IT WAS ACTUALLY THERE I SAY IT PEACEFUL. IT WAS A GOOD THING BECAUSE DEREK TELLS HEALTH TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORSE ANDWE NEARLY LOST IN THREE SEPARATE TIMES OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. AND THE INEVITABLE CHANGE I JUST NEVER REALIZED HOW MUCH CHANGE THERE WOULD BE. HIS CASE MANAGER WITH MOVING TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS WHICH GIVEN THE CALIBER OF HER SUPPORT WAS NOT SURPRISING SHE HAD BEEN AMAZING. THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS START DEREK GET BOUNCED FROM CASE MANAGER TO CASE MANAGER SOMETIMES THERE WOULD BE WRITTEN NOTIFICATION OFTEN NOT. USUALLY I WOULD HEAR FROM ANOTHER PARENT OCCASIONALLY I WOULD HEAR FROM THE CURRENT CASE MANAGER IN A PHONE CALL. ONE DAY I'D HAD ENOUGH YET AGAIN I WAS BEING NOTIFIED THAT THIS CASE MANAGER WAS CHANGING. THIS TIME I NO. CALLED IN IN. THAT I ABLE TO SEE TO US.

ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING. I'VE SAID FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS THE WORST THING I EVER DID AS A MOTHER WAS TO MOVE MY FAMILY FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY TO SOLANO COUNTY. WHY BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU CROSS THE BRIDGE SERVICES ARE DIMINISHED YOUR SUPPORT GOES DOWN 50% RESOURCES ARE DOWN 50% AND ALTHOUGH SOME WOULD SAY THAT IT'S A GOOD THING THAT ALL REGIONAL CENTERS DO NOT RUN THE SAME WAY I DISAGREE THE FOUNDATION OF ALL REGIONAL CENTERS SHOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME AND IF ONE CENTER HAS AN APPROVED VENDOR THAT COMPRISED SERVICES THAT WOULD BENEFIT OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND ALL CENTER SHOULD ALLOW THAT WITH THAT VENDOR TO BE APPROVED WITH LITTLE TO NO ADDITIONAL STOPS. I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. ONCE WE MOVED FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY TO SOLANO IT TOOK A YEAR TO GET A COORDINATOR ASSIGNED TO US. ONCE A SIGN TO US OUR COORDINATOR STAYED WITH US THROUGH DORIAN'S JUNIOR YEAR AT LEAST I THINK THAT WAS AT. I CAN'T REMEMBER BECAUSE DORIAN'S COORDINATOR WENT AND MY A AT THAT TIME IN OUR LIVES. AND I DID NOT KNOW THAT HE HAD RETIRED FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER UNTIL I SAW MATTER LOCAL SAFEWAY. ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THAT WE MET HIS NEW COORDINATOR. WE MET WITH HER ONE TIME ATTEMPTED TO DO A FOLLOW UP. SHE WAS NO LONGER RETURNING MY CALLS WHY BECAUSE SHE WAS NO LONGER EMPLOYED WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. NEW COORDINATOR NEW MEETING FOLLOW UP WITHIN OUR AGREED UPON AND A GREAT AMOUNT OF TIME OF THREE MONTHS AND AGAIN NO COORDINATOR TO BE FOUND I LEFT MESSAGES AND AFTER AWHILE OF TRYING I CALLED THE SUPERVISOR AND AT THAT TIME I WAS TOLD BY THE SUPERVISOR IT WAS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO NOTIFY THE CLIENTS WHEN A COORDINATOR HAS LEFT AND IT WAS THE CLIENT THAT NEEDED TO CALL THE REGIONAL CENTER. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO. I CAN'T SAY. THIS HAS CHANGED WITH THE MOST RECENT COORDINATOR CHANGE FOR DORIAN WE WERE GIVEN NOTICE BY BOTH THE OUTGOING COORDINATOR AND HIS NEW COORDINATOR. UNFORTUNATELY THROUGH ALL OF THE CHANGES THEY STILL CAN'T SEE HIS NAME PROPERLY. THROUGHOUT DORIAN'S. YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE BEHAVIOR THERAPY FOR AND WHEN IT WAS NEEDED HOWEVER THE OLDER HE BECAME HIS NEEDS ALSO CHANGED HE NEEDED MORE SOCIALIZATION BECAUSE HE WASN'T GETTING AT WE ASK FOR RESOURCES AND WAS GIVEN AN OUTDATED RESOURCE SHEET. WE FOUND OUT THAT MOST OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE WERE OUT THERE THAT WERE GIVEN TO US FOR EITHER OUT OF BUSINESS OR DIDN'T FIT. MY SON'S NEEDS COORDINATOR AT THAT TIME THIS WAS MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO HAD SUGGESTED ACCOUNT. I TRIED TO ASK FOR MORE PRO AND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM. ACCORDING TO REALLY DIDN'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT IT BUT INSISTED THAT IT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD THING FOR DURING TO ATTEND. IT WASN'T. IN THREE SHORT DAYS DINES BEHAVIOR REGRESSED. I STARTED RECEIVING CALLS THAT DURING AN WAS NOT LOOKING THE BATHROOM DOORS AND THE FORCE AND CRAWLING ON THE GROUND AND TAKING HIS CLOTHES OFF AT SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH THIS HAPPENED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I BRING IT UP BECAUSE SOME THINGS HAVE NOT CHANGED. I FEEL THE COORDINATOR SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAMS THEY'RE REFERRING CLIENTS TO. HANDING SOMEONE A PIECE OF PAPER DOESN'T ALWAYS HELP I GET IT I UNDERSTAND IT'S ALSO THE PARENTS RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SOME OF THE RESEARCH AS WELL. HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT IF SOMEONE AT THE CENTER HAD DONE A SITE VISIT. AND MAKE NOTES IN THE SYSTEM I BELIEVE THAT THEY MAY HAVE KNOWN THAT MY SON WAS NOT A FIT. FOR THIS PROGRAM. THIS WILL ALSO GO ALONG WITH WORK SITES AS WELL. DURING THIS FINALLY MADE THE DECISION THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO WORK SO WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIM TO GET STARTED. A PROGRAM CALLED-GONE FOR GOOD. IT TOOK ABOUT TWO MONTHS FOR US TO GET STARTED. ALTHOUGH ANOTHER CLIENT OF THE REGIONAL START CENTER STARTED THEIR PROGRESS AFTER US IT ONLY TOOK THEM THREE WEEKS TO BEGAN WHEN IT TOOK US MORE THAN TWO. WE WERE TOLD THAT DORIAN WHICH SHOT OF SOMEONE BEFORE HE STARTED. AND WOULD HAVE TO AND I WOULD HAVE TO STAY ON SITE AND STARRING WAS NOT AN EMPLOYEE. THE DOWNSIDE DURING TO NOT SHADOW ANY WHEN YOU WATCH TELEVISION FOR THREE HOURS. WELL HE WAS WATCHING TV I WAS IN THE LIBRARY. AND I WAS WATCHING INDIVIDUAL SLEEP AT THE TABLE- AND INDIVIDUALS WALKING THE HALLWAY FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS. ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WAS ON THEIR PHONE- WITH NO WHEN ENGAGING ARE CHECKING ON THEM AND THIS WENT ON FOR A FEW HOURS. DORIAN CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME HE WAS BORED WITH WATCHING TV. AND THAT HE WANTED TO SHOT OF SOMEONE. I ASKED THE WORKER AND SHE SAID THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS SHADOWING. AND THAT DURING COULD GOING TO THE ART ROOM OR PLAY GAMES THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS THERE FOR. ALTHOUGH WE WERE HESITANT WHEN WE DID MOVE FORWARD WITH GONE FOR GOOD. DIANE WAS THERE TO WORK AND IN THE- FIRST ONE AND A HALF MONTHS THAT HE WAS THERE HE ONLY WORKS FOR DAYS. MOST DAYS HE WAS PICKED UP LATE AT TIMES HE WASN'T PICKED UP AT ALL I TOLD THIS TO HIS REGIONAL CENTER COORDINATOR AND I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED TO PLACE A COMPLAINT. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THREE MONTHS LATER WHEN WE HAD TO SEE HER. DID SHE ACTUALLY GIVE ME A FORM TO COMPLETE. IF I NEEDED TO FILL OUT A FORM. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ME. THE DAY THAT I CALLED. AND SAID THERE WERE ISSUES. WE TRY TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE FOR DURING AND IS VERY VOCAL AND VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT HE DOES NOT WANT TO DO. HE TOLD US TO IS COORDINATOR NO JANITORIAL NO LANDSCAPING NO SUB MINIMUM WAGE. SHE SUGGESTED PRIDE I REMINDED HER THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO DO THE TYPES OF JOBS THAT PRIDE OFFERED. SHE SAID THEY HAD OTHER OPTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. SO AGAINST HER BETTER JUDGMENT WE WENT AHEAD AND WENT TO PRIDE. AND THE FIRST THING THAT WE WERE TOLD THAT DARIEN COULD DO. WITH LANDSCAPING OR CONCERTS CUSTODIAL WORK. DORIAN SAID THAT HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN EITHER OF THOSE. THEY THEN OFFERED TO WORK IN THE PRIDE WHERE HOUSE MAKING THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWO CENTS AN HOUR. HIS COORDINATOR DID NOT LISTEN TO US. IN BOTH INSTANCES WE COULD HAVE SAVE TIME AND ENERGY IF SHE HAD LISTENED TO SOMEONE FROM FROM US AND IF THE REGIONAL CENTER HAD MADE PERIODIC SITE VISITS TO THESE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. WE JUMP OVER FOR DORIAN'S CONTINUE NEED FOR SOCIALIZATION. I DRIVE MY SON BETWEEN FREMONT ARANDA SAN FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO DAVIS TO FIND YOUR SUPPORT AND SOCIAL GROUPS BECAUSE HIS COORDINATOR HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S AVAILABLE. THE LAST STRAW WAS WITH HIS A RENDER GROUP WHICH COSTS NINETY DOLLARS FOR AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES OF PEER SUPPORT. THEY WENT ON BREAK THE ORGANIZER CALLED AND SAID THAT THE GROUP WAS GOING TO HANG OUT AT THE FOOD TRUCKS HAD DINNER AND BE WITH THEIR FRIENDS. WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA AND TELL THE ORGANIZER SAID THAT DORIAN COULD PAY THE AID NINETY DOLLARS. I THOUGHT THAT WAS CREEK KIND OF CRAZY. THAT MY SON WOULD PAY NINETY DOLLARS TO HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS AT A FOOD TRUCK. THIS ORGANIZATION IS NOT VENDOR AS WITH REGIONAL CENTER. SO THAT MONEY THAT DORIAN SPENDS IS HIS OWN PERSONAL MONEY AND IT'S HALF OF HIS SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME. PRESS THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW AND IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT DURING AND I DECIDED TO START OUR OWN GROUP CALLED FOUND IT WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE PEER SUPPORT AND SOCIALIZATION IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY. OTHERS IS NOT A PLAGUE BUT IT IS A VIABLE SORT RESOURCE FOR GUYS AND GALS AND IT DOESN'T COST ANY MONEY FOR ANYONE TO ATTEND. WE'VE INVITED DURING ITS COORDINATOR TO OUR MEETINGS AND SHE'S NEVER ATTENDED. YET ANOTHER CLIENTS COORDINATOR HAS ATTENDED A COMMUNITY MEETING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHILE ONE WOULD DO WITH THAT FOR THEIR CLIENT. OUR COORDINATOR WOULDN'T DO IT FOR HER CLIENT. BEING THAT HE'S THE ONE THAT STARTED THIS ORGANIZATION AND SOMETHING HE'S VERY PROUD AT. THIS IS NOT TO BE A DICK HONEST COORDINATOR BUT MORE SO FOR THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION RESOURCES BENDER PROCESS AND A LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND A LACK OF FUNDING. I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS HOWEVER I SAW THERE WAS A PROBLEM FOR MY SON AND I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING SO WE STARTED A NONPROFIT AND I APPLIED TO BECOME A BOARD MEMBER AND NORTH BAY REGIONAL CENTER. DURING THE REGIONAL CENTER MEETINGS I CAN SEE THE VISION I CAN SEE THE DIRECTION. I CAN SEE MOVED. THE MOVEMENT ON A LARGE SCALE. BUT IT DOES NOT TRANSLATE TO MY SON AS A CLIENT. I KNOW THIS IS BEING WORKED ON. AND WE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL LEADER AT NORTE REGIONAL CENTER. BUT IT'S BEEN A REALLY LONG ROAD FOR STARRING IN AND I AND I KNOW THAT THE ROAD IN FRONT OF US CONTINUES TO BE ALL ALONG WHEN. WE BAKED FOR MORE FUNDING EFFORTS MORE RESOURCES MORE COMMUNITY OUTREACH WITH NORTH BAY REGIONAL CENTER OR ALL REGIONAL CENTERS. WHICH NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY LIVE AND WE SHOULD ALL GET THE SAME BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL ENTITLED TO IT. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE PANEL. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH OF WHAT I DESCRIBE YOU AS IS MY MOM AFFAIRS. WE NEED A LOT OF MOM AFFAIRS. I'M GONNA BREAK FROM THE AGENDA I KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN END IN OUR AUDIENCE. OF THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WONDER WILLIAMS WAS WHO. IS A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE THAT ALSO WAS AN AVID APPARENT I DISLIKE HER TO BE ABLE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF HER LIFE EXPERIENCE OF GOING FORWARD. AND THEN AFTER THAT I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER UP. PRO TEN. AS OKAY MULLIN AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE HIM SAY A FEW WORDS I A THIS WILLIAMS. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SO AND I TO DO THIS APPLY EVERYONE THAT IN THIS TODAY BECAUSE MEANS THEY CAN OF THIS ISSUE IN THIS CONCERN FOR. OUR CHILDREN AND I LIKE TO SAY CHILDREN WITH ABILITIES BECAUSE EVERY PERSON IN THIS WORLD HAVE AN ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT THEY'RE GIVING THAT THE OFFER. IN SEOUL I'M IS GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU AS A MOTHER AS A PARENT ADVOCATE. WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED NOW I'VE YOU SAY THAT. MY EXPERIENCES MAYBE A LITTLE BEEN EXCEPTIONAL BECAUSE I BUILT MY OWN APPARENT- RESOURCE GROUP AND SO I BECAME APPARENT ADVOCATE FOR THEM BUT IN THE BEGINNING STAGES I CAN SAY IT WAS ROUGH. TRYING TO NAVIGATE AND UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM HOW IT WORKS ALL THE ACRONYMS AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THE IEP MEETING OR IPP MEANING IT CAN BE INTIMIDATING. BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW. HOW TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. AND WHAT I'VE SHARED WITH- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER IS THE NEED TO HELP THE PARENT. ADVOCATE AND WORK THROUGH THE SYSTEM HELPING IT TO BE MORE STREAMLINED. BUT I'M A MOTHER OF TWO SONS MICHAEL AND DAVID DAVID- IS CONSIDERED IDT. BUT MY SON WHO IS NO LONGER HERE HE PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. HE WAS THE P. TO ME OF JOY. HE WAS A BLESSING TO ME AND TO EVERYONE HE INTERACTED WITH. DAVID HAD MANY DESIRES THINGS THAT HE WANTED TO OVERCOME AND ACCOMPLISH AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE. GOING OFF TO COLLEGE AND FOR PARENTS WHO HAVE CHILDREN WITH WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES. THAT COULD BE A CHALLENGE SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF SPECTRUM THAT THEY'RE ON WITH AUTISM. ALTHOUGH MY SON WAS HIGH FUNCTIONING HE STILL HAD DIFFICULTY IS LOOKING AT YOU. EXPRESS SEEN WHAT HE NEEDED TO SHARE BECAUSE HIS SPOTS WERE RECAPTURED IN HIS IN HIS MIND IN IT HE ARTICULATED THAT TO ME THAT WAS HIS DIFFICULTY. BUT I HAD TO PERSONALLY. GOAL TOTAL TELL WITH THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO FIND. A PROGRAM FOR MY SON HIS TEACHER WILL CALL ME AND SAY WANDA I NEED YOU TO GO OUT THERE AND ADVOCATE BECAUSE I CAN'T GET THESE OTHER AGENCIES TO HELP ME. PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED. AND I CAN SAY THAT MY REGIONAL CENTER. A CORD NADER WAS EXCEPTIONAL BUT WHEN SHE RETIRED. BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT TO DO I CAN'T SAY EVERY PARENT KNOWS WHAT TO DO I NEED TO CALL MY RESOURCES AN AXE FOR REFERRAL. WHO IS THE BASS COORDINATOR THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP ME. GET THE SERVICES MY CHILD MEET. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD. DOWN END OF DEALT WITH COORDINATORS THAT WERE NOT FORTHCOMING. AND IN REGARDS TO THEIR WEBSITE ON THAT TOO I IS AN ISSUE MY COORDINATOR HAD TO FORWARD ME ALL THE DIFFERENT. PROGRAMS THAT WERE AVAILABLE AND- REGIONAL CENTER THAT MY SON UTILIZE WITH NORTH BAY WOULD MOST OF THOSE SERVICES WERE IN NAPA. I HAPPEN TO HAVE A WHEELCHAIR SELF SYBIL VAN MY SON NOT ONLY WILL ADD ID BE HE WAS PHYSICALLY DISABLED DUE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY. BUT I YOU DON'T HAVE A VAN A YOU KNOW HAVE THE CAPABILITIES TO GET TO THESE PLACES YOUR CHILD IS STOCK. WHAT ELSE SERVICES WITHOUT THE CAPABILITY TO ENJOY. QUALITY OF LIFE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. MAKING SURE ALL OUR CITIZENS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN SEOUL. MY SON DAVID NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN SOLANO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. HOLD A CULTURE PROGRAM AND LET ME SAY THIS HE WAS THE CATALYST FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND WHEN I MEAN TO THAT IS. THEY ALREADY HAD A ADOPTED A HORTICULTURE PROGRAM BUT THE PROGRAM DID NOT PROVIDE SERVICES OR HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO ALSO DEAL WITH SOMEONE IN WILL CHEER SO TODAY THE SCHOOL HAVE MADE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS BUT- I HAD TO PUT MY SON OUT THERE. TO LEAD THE WEIGHING SO ANOTHERCHILD CAN HAVE. THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT MIGHT FUNDED. BUT I'M NOT IN AT EVERY REGIONAL CENTER LOCATION. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW TO STREAMLINE THIS SYSTEM WERE THEY ARE OFFERING THIS IS SIMILAR SERVICES BASED ON THEIR AREA. AND ALSO HELPING TO EQUIP PERRANCE WITH THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THEIR TRIAL EFFECTIVELY. I WILL ALSO CALL THE PARA FROM HAIL BUT I LET THEM KNOW I'M THE PARENT FROM HAVEN'T BECAUSE I'M HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR MY CHILD AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW WE ARE CONCERNED WITH ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN I'M HERE TODAY ABOUT MY SON. AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT MY CHILD. AND THEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN MATRIX MATRIX ACTUALLY TRAINED ME AS A PARENT BECAUSE I TOO FELT LOST IN THE PROCESS AND BECAUSE OF THAT TRAINING I WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM LET THEM KNOW IN THE I EP AND IPP PROCESS THAT. THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP. IT'S NOT YOU'RE TELLING ME WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S WORKING TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY. TO MAKE SURE THAT MY CHILD IN ANY OTHER CHILD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GOOD GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE IN SEOUL I JUST CAME TO THE AID TO- SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AS A PARENT AS A PARENT ADVOCATE.

UP PANEL FOR THEIR CONVERSE FOR THEIR COMMENTS ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE ARE REGIONAL CENTERS FACE BUT- IT'S NOT THE TOPIC OF THE HEARING TODAY BUT I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE- OUR COMMITMENT. TO THE FUNDING ISSUE. WE ARE IN THE WINDOW. THE PRE RECESS WIND. WHERE WE HAVE A GROWING. AND A BUDGET SURPLUS IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MAKE THE STRUCTURAL KINDS OF BUDGET FUNDING CHANGES- IN THIS WINDOW I FEAR- THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE. SO THERE IS AN URGENCY AROUND THIS ISSUE IT'S AN URGENCY THAT I KNOW THE CHAIR- SHARES- WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS ON THIS PANEL SO- IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PROPER OVERSIGHT FUNDING TRAINING ALL THOSE THINGS MUCH OF THIS COMES DOWN TO A BUDGET DECISION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY AND STRUCTURAL- BUDGET ISSUES SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH ON THAT BUT GRATEFUL FOR EVERYBODY- ATTENDING TODAY AND- FOR YOUR- I OPENING- INPUT.

IN A MEMBER OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON THE ABOUT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES I REPRESENT THE NINE STATE REGION. I LOVE THE ART I REPRESENT HOWEVER WE HAVE THE ISSUES TO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TOP TO TRAVEL. TO ANOTHER COUNTY ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR MILES. TO RECEIVE SERVICES THEY DESERVE I'M A CLIENT OF THE FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER. I THINK MY REGIONALS AND I'VE BEEN GOOD ABOUT SUPPORTING SELF ADVOCATES THEY SUPPORT PEOPLE FIRST IN MY% AREA AND HELP. MAYBE BECAUSE- BECOME A LEADER THE REGIONAL CENTER ALSO HELPS ME PAY BILL BY BEING MY REP PETE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. I CURRENTLY LIVE N AN APARTMENT WITH A ROOMMATE IN REDDING. I RECIEVED SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICES I HAVE GOOD HELP THROUGH PROPER SERVICE TO FIND A PLACE TO LAY OF. I FRANKLY DON'T HAVE HELP ON WEEKENDS I NEED HELP ON WEEKENDS TOO. THE STAFF WHO HELPED ME. CHANGES A LOT WE NEED TO PAY PEOPLE BETTER SO THEY CAN HELP WHEN I NEED HELP. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN APARTMENTS THAT ARE AND NOT IN SAY PLACES. WE NEED HELP. WE NEED TO HELP PEOPLE WITH RANT SO THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN SAFE PLACES SALLY PEOPLE WILL TAKE A BAG TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET AROUND BUT LIVE IN A RURAL AREA. SO THERE ARE ARE A LOT OF. SO THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF OPTIONS SOMETIMES I DON'T FEEL SAFE I HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME SOMETIMES. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME. ONE PROGRAM OREGANO SHASTA CONNECT THAT OFFERS FREE SERVICES. OUR FREE RIDES ON SUNDAY TO ATTEND CHURCH OR TO GO TO OTHER PLACES I WOULD LIKE YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS PROGRAM. SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS EVERY. HERE WERE WEAPONS THAT RURAL AREAS IN THE STATE I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA. ONE OF THE PROBLEM PROMISES I HAVE SEEN IS THAT WHEN WE UP. PUBLIC. SAFETY POWERS SHOT OFF SOME OF THE WORLD DO NOT I WATER. WE SHOULD SOLVE PROBLEMS LIKE THIS ONE. THAT WITH THE MADE THIS THE LIVE IN OR IS. I DON'T IN REDDING. AND I THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT LIVE RATHER FROM REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE BIG ROLE A ARE AT I REPRESENT. I AM RETIRED FROM WORKING I WORK AS A PEER INSTRUCTOR AT THE WE CARE A LOT ABOUT NATION. FROM TWO THOUSAND AND. TEN TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A JOB THAT I QUIT. THE EMPLOYER WAS DOING TIME STUDIES ON ME AND TESTED JUST OF MY- READY. THEY WANTED TO PAY ME LESS THAN MEN WAGE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE COMPARED TO SOMEONE ELSE AND I DESERVED A BETTER WORKPLACE SO I WALKED OUT. I THINK EVERY PERSON SHOULD GET PAID THE SAME WORK. THE SAME FOR WORK THEY DO. A LOT OF TIMES I DO NOT FEEL SAFE WE NEED TO CREATE MORE SAFE PLACES FOR SLUSH BY ACTION. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE JOB. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU THE SOCIAL RECREATION PROGRAMS COME BACK TO THE REGIONAL CENTER. SOME PEOPLE DISABILITIES HAVE A SAFE PLACE. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROGRAMS WHERE THE DANCES THE DANCERS ARE GOOD. IT GIVES ME A CHANCE TO CATCH UP WITH PEOPLE AND SOMEONE WILL COME UP TO ME AND SAY HI. I WANT TO FEEL SAFE I WANT OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE MORE FRIENDS. I WANT THAT SUPPORTS I NEED I THINK THE STATE LEGISLATORS SHOULD HELP THE REGIONAL CENTERS IN OTHER PROGRAMS. DO YOU HAVE THE FUNDING TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN LIVE. THE ALLIES WE WANT. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO JUSTIN. JUSTIN'S FROM YOU READY. GOOD AFTERNOON AS ONLY ONE FRAZIER AND EVERYONE I AM EXTREMELY HONORED TO BE HERE I'M IN A UNIQUE POSITION HERE BECAUSE I'M NOT ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF A REGIONAL CENTER- PART AVERAGE JUST BECAUSE I THINK AT THE TIME WHEN I WAS SAME PUBLIC SCHOOL WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW. THAT THESE THINGS EXISTED SO I DEFINITELY THINK. AWARENESS ON THESE REGIONAL CENTERS IS DEFINITELY KEY. BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER I AM AN AMBASSADOR FOR SPECIAL OLYMPICS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH I HAVE BEEN A PART OF THAT ORGANIZATION FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. AT AND I LOVE GOING AROUND GIVING SPEECHES. SO I ALSO WANT TO JUST GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND. SO WHEN I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED MY DISABILITIES THE PERSON DOING SO. GOT THIS IT REACHES EARNERS CONCLUSION THAT I HAD A SEVERE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AND THEY THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL. I PROVED THEM WRONG NOT ONLY DID I GRADUATE FROM GUN HIGH SCHOOL INTO THE LITTLE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WITH. A SKILL OF FROM ZERO TO FOUR ONE ON MY GP WAS LIKE A THREE POINT EIGHT. BY I THEN WENT ON AND GOT MY MASTER'S DEGREE SO. YEAH I. MISDIAGNOSIS LIKE THAT THEY'RE JUST GOING TO CAUSE STRESS. SO ANYWAY. I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT WHAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS DO BUT ALSO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IMPROVED. AND WHEN I WAS DOING COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND MY UNDERGRADUATE WORK AT SAN TRANSFERRED I DID WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF VOCATIONAL REHAB. WHICH PROVIDED SOME SIMILAR SERVICES LIKE JOB COACHING AND PAYING FOR COLLEGE. THE FIRST TIME AFTER I GRADUATED I HAD A COUNSELOR THAT FOCUSED. ON ME TRYING TO GET A JOB. BUT I WAS ADAMANT ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE SO THAT ENDED UP. NOT WORKING OUT. WHICH MADE ME FEEL LIKE IT WAS A THEY WERE APPROACHING MY ISSUE. OR MY CASE WITH A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOESN'T WORK. YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAILOR YOUR SERVICES TO FIT THE NEEDS OF THOSE CLIENTS. AND I REALLY THINK THE SAME COULD BE SAID FOR. REGIONAL CENTERS TO. I HAD BETTER LUCK WHEN I TRANSFERRED TO SAN FRANCISCO STATE WITH ANOTHER COUNSELOR WHO. HELP ME. PAY FOR MY BOOKS AND THE TUITION. FOR MY HISTORY UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR A BUT WHEN IT CAME TO TIME TO GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL WHERE I COMPLETED MY MASTERS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. I HAD A PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS THAT THE PARTNER VOCATIONAL REHAB WAS NOT GOING TO PAY. FOR THAT. SO GIVE ME FOR MAY I SHOULD'VE MORE RESEARCH BEFORE I DECIDED TO GO THAT ROUTE BUT STILL IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT. SO NOW I'M CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED BY I'M LOOKING AT EVENTUALLY GETTING IN TOUCH WITH A REGIONAL CENTER BUT MY PASSION IS STILL BEING AN ADVOCATE FOR THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. WHICH IS WHY I'M GRATEFUL THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE HERE AS CHAMPIONS OF THIS MOVEMENT. WE REALLY NEED AS MANY ALLIES AS WE CAN GET. SO MY PASSION AGAIN I WANT TO. YOU KNOW GET BACK TO THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY BE AN ADVOCATE IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER. AND I KNOW MAYBE GETTING IN TOUCH WITH A REGIONAL CENTER LIKE. THE SAN ANDREAS REGIONAL CENTER BECAUSE I LIVE IN PAUL TELL TO GETTING IN TOUCH WITH THE MIGHT MAYBE HELP ME FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GO ABOUT. DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO THAT'S BASICALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY AND AGAIN MY MESSAGES. WHEN IT COMES TO SERVICES. THE THEY NEED TO BE TAILORED FOR THOSE WHO HAVE REALLY BIG AMBITIONS LIKE GOING ON A COLLEGE A GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL LIKE ME YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AND I ALSO COULD ARGUE THAT ALSO APPLIES TO US SPECIAL EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS WELL SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF MY THIRTY YEARS OF LIFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY GOOD WESLEY. GOOD AVENUE CHURCH I'M AFRAID YOU'RE A MEMBER COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS WESLEY WAS GOING I'M A SELF ADVOCATE IN THAT LARGE MEMBER OF THE STATE CAN ALSO DEVELOP DISABILITIES I AM ALSO CHAIR OF THE PLAN THE FIRST COMMITTEE.

AND BEING ABLE TO GIVE US GUIDANCE AND INPUT INTO IMPROVING THE SYSTEM TO DELIVER SERVICES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE- BUT I ALSO WANT TO- ACKNOWLEDGE JUST THE REMARKABLE PANELS THAT YOU JUST HAD- BUT SAY GOSH YOU KNOW HAVING TO FOLLOW THAT REALLY- OKAY I WILL DO MY BEST. BUT THEY ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE AND SO I DO FEEL HONORED TO BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF THAT DISCUSSION TODAY WAS SUCH A REMARKABLE FOLKS THAT JOIN TO- WHEN. I'M WE WERE HERE LAST IN. I WAS ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE TO PRESENT ON WHAT OUR SYSTEM SERVICES ARE AND HOW WE DELIVER SERVICES. AND DURING THAT TIME I WAS ALSO ABLE TO PROVIDE. THAN JUST A OF FRAMEWORK FOR WHERE WE HAD PRIORITIES AND INITIATIVES AND I'D LIKE TO JUST GIVE YOU AN UPDATE. ON SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS- WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S CONTINUE TO WORK TO BE DONE WITH OUR COMMUNITY AND MANY OF THE INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. ARE NOT JUST AS I OFTEN SAY IT'S NOT JUST AN EVENT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT. HOW DO WE MOVE OUR SERVICE SYSTEM FORWARD BECAUSE OUR OUR NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS ARE CHANGING AND WE ALSO LEARN AND IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. SO QUICKLY JUST AS AN UPDATE ON ONE ALSO PROVIDE JUST A FRAMEWORK FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE SERVING- ABOUT- TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE TAKING A LOOK AT- TRACKING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE ONE OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE RECOGNIZE AND SEEING INCREASED NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM- WE WERE SERVING ABOUT FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM. AT THE TIME THAT REPRESENT A 20% OF THE CONSUMER POPULATION THAT WE SERVE. I'M TODAY WE'RE SERVING ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO DO HAVE AUTISM. REPRESENTING OF OUR TOTAL CONSUMER POPULATION- OF NOTE AND THIS IS I THINK JUST REALLY WHERE THE RELEVANCE IS TWENTY. OF THOSE- INDIVIDUALS WITH- AUTISM UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO IT RUPTURES 80% OF OUR- AUTISM POPULATION. AND SO AS WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE MOVE OUR SYSTEM FORWARD AND HOW WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT SERVICES WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR SYSTEM CHANGES. NOT ONLY THAT BUT ALSO BASED ON OUR ETHNICITIES. TODAY WE'RE PROJECTING- SERVICES IN. OUR CURRENT YEAR IN JANUARY OF. SUPPORTING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS FOR PROTECTING THIS NEXT YEAR- IT WHICH IS IDENTIFIED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. OF SUPPORTING. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY TWO AND OF ENJOY. WE ARE ALSO RIGHT. THE NEED TO MAY SURE THAT WE- WERE ESTABLISHING ONLY SERVICES. YEAH BUT RECOGNIZE THE AND- OF THAT ACCOUNT OF. OVER INTO. AND I THINK SOME OF THE UPDATES I GIVE YOU TODAY WILL WE'LL GET TO THAT- WE JUST RECENTLY- MOVED. REALLY EVERYBODY FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE WERE SERVING A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND STATE OPERATED SERVICES. BUT AGAIN THIS IS A REAL FRAMEWORK TO SAY THAT WE ARE REALLY A COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM- AS OF TODAY WE REALLY WE ONLY HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL REMAINING AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER THAT WILL BE MOVING TO THE COMMUNITY. SO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED NOT ONLY DEVELOPING RESOURCES FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. BUT REALLY THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE SIMILAR NEEDS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IS THE IMPLEMENTATION AND APPROVAL OF THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. SO IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAD APPROVAL FEDERAL APPROVAL TO IMPLEMENT TODAY WE HAVE A HUNDRED TWELVE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL BUDGETS. IN PROVIDING THEIR OWN SELF DIRECTED CHOICE- AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR SERVICES- WE DO HAVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE NATIONAL STAGES AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL ORIENTATIONS. AND MEETINGS TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM. ACHIEVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL BUDGETS TO MOVE FORWARD. WE ALSO RELIGIOUS THE- AS YOUR FROM YOUR WITH WITH THE RATE STUDY AND MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND THE UPDATED ONE IN JANUARY- THIS YEAR- WITH THE UPDATED RATE MODELS- THAT WAS THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE WORK WITH. I'M NOT ONLY THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD IT PUT FROM THE COMMUNITY. NOT FOR SERVICE. THROUGH SURVEY BUT THAT MEETING WITH OUR CAN. THE CONSUMER SELF ADVOCATES AND FOUND MEMBERS. THIS IS REALLY AND NOT ONLY INFORM THE RIGHTS TO BUT ALL. TO A- WHERE DO WE NEED TO TAKE A. LOOK AT TO HAVE FOR CONVERSATIONS AS TO WHAT'S IN. TO END OF. AND IS WERE STRUCTURE OUR SERVER. AND TAKING A LOOK AT HOW MOVE AND- FOR. IN ARE SAYS FOR WERE. THAT WE NEED TO KEEP THAT IN. IN THE FOR OF OUR MIND. ONE OF THE AREAS IN WHICH I HAD TALKED ABOUT THE LAST TIME WAS IMPORTANCE OF TAKING A LOOK OUR A- OUR NEEDS AND SERVICES TO AN BEING DELIVERED. IT DOES THOSE INTO THE COMMUNITY ONE WAS WITHIN OUR- NOW. SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY ENHANCE OUR SAFETY NOT SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH COMPLEX NEEDS AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS CHANGING. THE COMPLEXITY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CO OCCURRING NEEDS PARTICULARLY THOSEWHO ARE IN FOSTER CARE AND BEING ABLE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I HEARD A COUPLE THE PANEL MEMBERS TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF NAVIGATING SYSTEMS NOT ONLY THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM BUT THEN ALSO OTHER SYSTEMS AND IT'S A IT'S NOT AN EASY WAY TO NAVIGATE. SO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE DID THAT IS IDENTIFYING WAYS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT- THE REGIONAL CENTERS IN ACCESSING SERVICES THROUGH CASE COORDINATION- WE WERE ABLE TO- HAVE PART OF THE BUDGET ACT LAST YEAR OF REDUCING SERVICE CASELOAD RATIOS ONE TO TWENTY FIVE. FOR THOSE COMPLEX NEEDS SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THAT THIS YEAR WE HAVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. IS A REDUCE CASELOAD RATIO FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AGES THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD TO ONE TO FORTY FIVE AND THIS REALLY DID STEM FROM A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD WITH FAMILIES- AND ALSO SERVICE COORDINATORS TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S CHALLENGING IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE. A YOUNG FAMILY WHO'S JUST BEEN- INFORMED THAT THEY HAVE A CHILD WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND THE CHALLENGE OF NAVIGATING WHETHER SCHOOL SYSTEM ACCESS SEEN COORDINATED CARE THROUGH OTHER SYSTEMS AND THEN ALSO NAVIGATING THE REGIONAL CENTER. THAT HAVING THAT LOWER CASE LOAD RATIO IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO WE HAVE THAT PROPOSED THIS YEAR IN MOVING THAT FORWARD. ALSO WITH THE SAFETY NET IS RECOGNIZING THAT FAMILIES HAVE SAID TO US THAT THEY REALLY NEED THE SUPPORTS IN A PREVENTATIVE WAY TO SUPPORT THEM IN THE FAMILY HOME AS OPPOSED TO. NOT ONLY STABILIZING IN INDIVIDUAL WHEN THINGS HAVE REALLY BECOME TOO AND A CUTE CRISIS SO WE'VE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. A CRISIS TEAM THAT CAN BE SUPPORTED IN THE FAMILY HOME OR IN THE SETTING THAT. THEIR LIVES. AND BEATING TO MEDI. IN RISK OF HAVING THEM MOVE. TO A RISK. SETTING THAT IS REALLY NOT TO BE INCLUSIVE IN THE THOU HOME. WELL IT'S NOT AS IS PRETTY AS SOME OF THE OTHER INITIATIVES YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS A COMPLIANCE WITH OUR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. BECAUSE WE ARE DEPENDENT AS A SYSTEM WE HAVE A VERY. WONDERFUL BENEFIT OF AN ENTITLEMENT AND CALIFORNIA FOR THE LETTERMAN OUT WE'RE WE'RE REALLY TIED TO OUR FEDERAL MATCH AND SO COMPLIANCE WITH OUR AGE CBS FEDERAL RULE WE'VE HAD SOME I'M REALLY GREAT PROGRESS IN BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. THE PROVIDER SELF ASSESSMENTS WORKING WITH THEIR PROVIDERS WESLEY DID A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND HOW WE MOVE THAT FORWARD. SOME OF THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO HELP PROVIDERS MOVE TOWARDS COMPLIANCE HAS REALLY BEEN TARGETED TO THE- SUPPORT OF COMPETITIVE AND INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AS AN EXAMPLE. ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS AS WE CLOSE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WE'RE ABLE TO PRESERVE- THE COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PLAN START UP DOLLARS TO START DEVELOPING OTHER RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE EVERY YEAR TO DEVELOP THE COMMUNITY. WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE THAT MORE TOWARDS KIND OF THAT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AS OPPOSED TO DEVELOPING- HOMES FOR FOLKS MOVING FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. ONE AGAIN YOU KNOW IS A COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND AN ADDITIONAL FIVE NEW EMPLOYMENT RELATED ACTIVITIES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. THROUGH THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT FUND WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO REALLY PUSH FORWARD THE INITIATIVES TO HOUSING AND TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN- PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT FUND TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR ELEVEN MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROJECTS WHICH YIELDED A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT SET ASIDE UNITS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENT THIS DISABILITIES- WE'VE WE ARE ALSO REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE ENHANCE OUR RISK MANAGEMENT. AND REGIONAL CENTER AND SERVICE SYSTEM. ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVER. COUPLE THINGS THAT REALLY CAME FOR TO OUR OUR TO. WAS HOW DO WE MAKE AND AGAIN YOU YOU HEARD IT TODAY. IS THAT WHEN A MEMBER IS ACCESSING SERVICES IN ONE AREA VERSUS ANOTHER AREA HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE SAME INFORMATION FROM ONE REGIONAL CENTER TO THE NEXT. SO ONE OF THE LAST YEAR'S INITIATIVES THAT WE HAD FORWARD THAT WERE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF. OF TALKING TO- APPLICANTS WAS THIS INFORMATION PACKET SO NO MATTER WHAT REGIONAL CENTER YOU GO INTO THAT EVERY PERSON WHO GOES TO ACCESS EARLY START SERVICES OR LETTERMAN SERVICES. THAT THEY RECEIVE THE SAME INFORMATION THAT INFORMATION PACKET IS INTENDED TO HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES. THEIR RIGHTS WHERE THEY CAN CALL IF THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE THE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO- ACCESS THOSE SERVICES SO IT WOULD INCLUDE DISABILITY RIGHTS INFORMATION. AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM THAT BY ITSELF DOESN'T ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS. SO IN ADDITION WE'RE WORKING ON A- SURVEY A QUICK SURVEY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO- FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ABOUT THEIR INITIAL- EXPERIENCE AND ENTERING INTO THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM- SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THOSE AREAS WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. ONE OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M I'M PARTICULARLY- EXCITED ABOUT NOT HAVING AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY AS OUR RE ORGANIZATION. WE HAD HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT THE BENEFIT OF HAVING- ONE OF THE DEPARTMENT STAFF BEING PRESENT. YOU KNOW IN THE COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT THE CONCERT CONCERNS ARE AND TO BE ABLE TO REACT IN A TIMELY WAY. BECAUSE WE HADN'T ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO I'M REACT IN A TIMELY WAY TO NOT ONLY CAN- CONSUMER AND FAMILY CONCERNS BUT ALSO THAN TO HELP THE REGIONAL CENTERS. TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE RESOURCES TO DO THE JOB THAT THEY NEED TO DO. SO WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION AND WE HAD FIFTH FOR NEW BECAUSE IT. AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE NOW LOCATED INTO A NEW ALL SINCE. FOREIGN SO WE'RE HAD FOR DIFFERENT LAYERS ON FOR THE TWO ONE REGIONAL SO. WE NOW HAVE. DIFFERENT SIGNED. THAT ARE WORKING WITH ALL OF THE RESULTS. SO WE NOW HAVE ALREADY STARTED IMPLEMENTING CHANGES WHERE WE'RE- AT ALL OF THE REACH CENTER. MEETING WE ATTENDING THAT CAN MEETING WHEN IT'S RELATE TO ANY OF DESPAIR FUNDS DISCUSSED. FROM THE COMMUTER AND ALSO ABLE TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE COMING IN. IS IT FULLY IMPLEMENTED NO BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY IS- PRETTY FAR ALONG THE WAY- MOVING FORWARD AS FAR AS ADDITIONAL KEY INITIATIVES- IN AREAS IN WHICH WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR. A GETTING REALLY DID STEM FROM THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THE DIFFERENT ARENAS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT. AND THAT IS A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES- PROPOSAL FOR- THE PERFORMANCE AND SENT. GRAHAM IT REALLY IS MOVING IN OUR SYSTEM TO A WAY TO MEASURE WHAT MATTERS TO INDIVIDUALS AND THE FAMILIES. AND TO BE ABLE TO GET IT IN A- IN A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH IS GOING TO BE DATA DRIVEN. BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO WHAT ARE THOSE QUALITATIVE EXPERIENCES THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE FACING. SO AS WE'RE DEVELOPING THE MODEL IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY. IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THOSE AREAS IN WHICH THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE BEING INFORMED BY THAT WE CAN THEN INFORM YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS TO SAY HOW ARE WE MEASURING AND ACCOUNTABLE FOR. NOT ONLY THE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING SPENT BUT MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW HAVE THE SERVICES THAT- BEING IDENTIFIED WHETHER IT'S IN THE I PP OR ARMENIAN NEEDS. NAVIGATE OTHER SYSTEMS SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH WE ARE WE I MEAN THAT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY. VERY QUICKLY I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON A BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE. MANY OF AT ONE PROVIDE PUBLIC. BUT ARE DEVELOPMENTS. TO FORCE IS GOING TO BE REALLY AND- IN THAT ENGAGEMENT. OUR PRIOR DEVELOP IT'LL SERVE TASK FORCE THAT WAS STRUCTURED- REALLY TO ADDRESS THE SERVICE SYSTEM. WAS WAS A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO GIVE US INPUT. THAT HELPED INFORM OUR POLICIES MOVING FORWARD- IT WAS A- I. DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER BUT I THINK IT WAS WE HAD AROUND THIRTY EIGHT PARTICIPANTS THAT WERE ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE. WHEN WE- WHEN OUT THIS TIME I WANTED TO DO AN APPLICATION PROCESS AND WE DID- I'M GLAD WE DID BUT WE ALSO RECEIVED OVER TWO HUNDRED APPLICATIONS. SO I THERE'S OF OTHER THINGS THAT WAS REAL. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD. ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TASK FORCE AND- WAS REALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY WE NEED TO TEND TO THAT A LITTLE BIT FROM WHAT OUR PREVIOUS FOCUS WAS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOW ALSO FOCUSING ON ALSO THE YOUNGER FAMILIES TAKING A LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE AREAS WHERE WE'RE HEARING THAT THERE'S- CONCERNS AND THAT WERE WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES AND THE DIFFERENT ETHNIC DIFFERENCES. SO WE THEN SAID LET'S GO AHEAD AND EMBRACES MANY OF THE- APPLICANTS AS WE COULD WE HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT PARTICIPANTS. SO WE HAVE OUR DS TASK FORCE AND THEN WE HAVE THE FIVE DIFFERENT WORK GROUPS WILL BE ADDRESSING MANY OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON OF OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. SYSTEM IN FISCAL REFORM LOOKING AT ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND SERVICE ACCESS AND- OUR DISPARITY EFFORTS. SO AS WE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE WERE PLEASE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD REPRESENTATION- BUT SO LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE SELF ADVOCATE. WILL BE. FOREVER TAPE THANK YOU TO SEND THAT AREA SO. AS WE DO MORE MORE WORK LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THIS CAN. AND OUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT RIGHT. THE AREA IN WHICH WE NEED TO BE IN FOR BY SO WE CAN MOVE WITH THE. THANK YOU NANCY ANY QUESTIONS MOM. THEY WERE SHARED AND THANK YOU MADAM DIRECTOR FOR THE COPPER. UP THE YOU TOUCHED ON THE RATE STUDY I'VE BEEN FOR ON THE JUST IN TERMS IN FOR OUR BUT DISCUSS TO THE DEPART HAVE SOME ACTIONABLE ITEMS FROM THAT RATE STUDY WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS. FOR THAT REPORT SO IT DOESN'T SIT ON A SHELF IT'S ACTUALLY NOT SEEING SOME LIFE IN THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE AND- IS THERE A OF A GROWING RECOGNITION OF LOOKING AT COST STRUCTURE CAN I COME FROM A VERY HIGH COST COUNTY SAN MATEO COUNTY AND- ON JUST THE DIFFICULTY IN PAYING PROVIDERS IN A SUPER HIGH COST AREA I APPRECIATE YOU TOUCHING ON THE HOUSING ISSUE THAT'S- ON. YOU KNOW NOT A DAY GOES THAT WE DON'T TINK ABOUT THIS AND FOR THE ID COMMUNITY- CARVING OUT- AFFORDABLE HOUSING- OPPORTUNITIES IS HUGE- OF A CONTINUING CONVERSATION BUT JUST IN TERMS OF- REGIONALIZATION AND LOOKING AT THE COST STRUCTURING AND- PAIN PROVIDERS APPROPRIATELY- WHERE MIGHT WE GO. WITH C. S. SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS FROM THE RATE STUDY. THANK YOU FOR THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THE RATE STUDY DID INFORM SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT YIELDED THE UP TO A POINT 2% FROM A MANY OF THE SERVICE CODES- CURRENT YEAR- WE ADDED WITH THE UPDATED RIGHT MODELS- AND FISCAL WE'RE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. IDENTIFY THREE ADDITIONAL SERVICE CODES TO TWO OF THEM TOUCH EARLY START AND ONE IS INDEPENDENT LIVING. TO WHICH IS PROPOSED FOR ADDING TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENT DO YOU RECALL LAST YEAR WAS FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT TOWARDS. TOTAL FUND FOR THOSE AND THEN THIS YEAR- FOR HALF A YEAR IT'S EIGHTEEN MILLION I THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR WHICH WOULD BE AN ANNUALIZED AMOUNT. SO BUT THE NEXT STEPSTHAT WERE I MEAN AS THE AS A DEPARTMENT THAT DISCUSSION TAKING IT TO OUR SYSTEM INFILL REFORM DISCUSSION REALLY LOOKING MORE AS A SYSTEM. AS FAR AS WHERE THEY PRESSURE SO MUCH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO IDENTIFY NEXT STEPS THEN FOCUS RIGHT NOW ON THAT PER. AND SON PROGRAM THE SEVEN EIGHT MILLION THAT'S PROPOSED THIS YEAR. IN REALLY TAKEN A LOOK AT THE FRAMEWORK OF HOW DO WE STILL FELT THE SYSTEM TO FORWARD THAT IS TOUCHING ON REBELS AND A FINE WAYS THAT WE MEASURE THE PROGRESS. THANK YOU THEN I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS ALSO WE LOOK AT THE HIGH COST. AREAS TO PERFORM SERVICES. AT SOME OF THESE LOW CUT LOCATIONS HAVE A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE WE TALK ABOUT THE EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT. YOU ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE A THE HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE IN THAT EQUATION. AS IS BEING UNFAIR- WAY TO APPROACH THAT I THINK THAT WE pCAN LOOK THAT IN THE BUDGET GO FORWARD. BUT I BEEN A BY SO OF OUR PER. THAT THE BOTH HAVE TO BE MEDICAL. YOU KNOW IF YOU AGAIN YOU KNOW YOU STARTED A RESPITE WORKER YOU ACT YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT ROOF COLLEAGUES FROM REGISTER RACKS HAVE WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE FAT OF WHAT SHE ACTUALLY NOW RECEIVE. AND WHICH MAY OF ORIGINS HERE HAS HAD THAT KIND OF WORKING KNOWLEDGE. AND IT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AND WORKING WITH US SO ALL YOU FOR THE ARE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW TO THE- CALIFORNIA LOTTERY CYPRUS. WITH THE- EARNINGS. ARE PRINCIPAL WATER. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE LARA. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAURA KERNEY AND I AM AN AUDIT PRINCIPLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THE COMMITTEE ASKED US 2% TODAY INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE IN RECENT REPORTS THAT WE FOR AT LEAST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID IS I WENT BACK TEN YEARS TO IDENTIFY JUST HOW MANY-REPORTS WE'VE RELEASED AND WE'VE RELEASED A TOTAL FIVE REPORTS REGARDING DDS IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT SOME OF THESE REPORTS ARE A FEW YEARS OLD THE MOST RECENT REPORT WAS RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THESE REPORTS COVERED A VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING DTS ES OVERSIGHT OF REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL AS ITS ADMINISTRATION OF IN HOME RESPITE SERVICES NOW THESE REPORTS RESULTED IN A TOTAL OF FORTY SIX RECOMMENDATIONS TO DDS AND THEY'VE HAD A RELATIVELY HIGH IMPLEMENTATION RATE THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIRTY NINE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO THEM. THERE ARE THREE THAT THEY ARE STILL WORKING TO IMPLEMENT IT AND THE RESULT OF OUR MOST RECENT REPORT TO BE RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THERE ARE ANOTHER FOR THAT THEY HAVE STATED THAT THEY WILL NOT IMPLEMENT I WAS GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION. TO THOSE OTHER RECOMMENDATION BUT I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON FIRST OF ALL WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. REALLY A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE FOCUS ON INCREASING OVERSIGHT BY DD UPS AND ALSO ENSURING THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER. CONSISTENT PROCESS IS SURE THE THEY'RE FIGHTING CAN ALREADY SIR THIS I IN ADDITION OUR RECORD. AS IT IS TO ANY TO IS REALLY TO IMPROVE ACTIVE NISSEN EFFICIENT AND GOVERNOR IN THOSE STATION LAMP TED ALL OF. OFFER. ON THE STATUS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN WE FOLLOW UP AGAIN EVERY YEAR THEREAFTER FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS- THE ENTITIES PROVIDE US WITH SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND THEN WE ASSESS. THE STATUS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS- IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE REPORTS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY HAVE ALREADY RUN THROUGH THAT CYCLE. WE ONLY HAVE THE ONE REMAINING FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT WERE STILL FOLLOWING UP ON. NOW AS IT RELATES TO THAT REPORT- WE CONDUCTED A REPORT A REGARDING IN HOME RESPITE SERVICES AS I INDICATED IT WAS RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WE FOUND A COUPLE OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ONE IT WAS NOT KENTUCKY CONDUCTING FISCAL AUDITS OF REGIONAL CENTERS THAT IT'S REQUIRED TO DO EVERY TWO YEARS WITH IN A TIMELY MANNER WE RECOMMENDED THAT EFFECTS THAT. I IN ADDITION. READ CENTERS MUST REVIEW VENDORS OR PROVIDERS FILES EVERY TWO YEARS THAT'S A FORM OF OVERSIGHT THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE OVER VENDORS. AND WE FOUND THAT THOSE REVIEWS BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS WERE NOT OCCURRING- OR IF THEY WERE OCCURRING THEY COULDN'T DEMONSTRATE TO US THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED. SO WE RECOMMENDED TO DDS AT THE INSURER THAT DIGITAL CENTERS HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THOSE REVIEWS OF HER. AYE DDS AGREED TO IMPLEMENT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONSBACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT AND THEY SAID. THAT THEY WILL IMPLEMENT THEM FULLY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES TO OF RECOMMENDATIONS THE DDS THAT THEY WOULDN'T EMPLOYMENT. I THINK THAT CAN BE INSIGHTFUL. IT'S IMPORTANT POINT OUT THOUGH THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE NEARLY TEN YEARS AGO- BUT WE STILL STAND BY THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. WHEN DR AUDIT TO TEN WHICH WAS A- RAW. BUT IT. UP WE DIE YES IS OVER I OF READ SKINNER. ACTION I VENDORS OF FOUND SOMETHING KINDS. OF FOR. WE FOR SOME INDICATION THERE WAS FOR. BY REGIONAL CENTERS WHEN SELECTING VENDORS AND OF COURSE THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS A SURE THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING HIGH SCHOOL THE SERVICES. ARE ANSWER. WELL FOUND THAT HE'D DIDN'T A PROPER TO OVER. HOW CENTERS WERE SELECTING VENDORS SO WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE TWO AREAS OF CONCERN BUT EDS STATED THAT IT DIDN'T BELIEVE IT HAD THE AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. WHICH IS A POSITION THAT OUR OFFICE STRONGLY. DISAGREED WITH AND STILL DOES- TODAY UP AND I ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN THOSE TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE WE MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. AND ACCOUNTABILITY. FINALLY WHEN I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE FACT THAT WE ALSO MAKE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS. I IN THE REPORTS OF DISCUSS HERE TO. WE MADE A TOTAL SEVEN. A ONE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN ACTED ON BY THE LEGISLATURE- IN TYPICALLY WE MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN WE IDENTIFY A NEED FOR A POLICY CHANGE OR WE NEED TO COMPEL THE DEPARTMENT. TO AT LEAST FOLLOW THROUGH WITH A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE BELIEVE WARRANTS LEGISLATIVE CHANGE SO AS AN EXAMPLE IN THAT IN THAT TWO THOUSAND TEN REPORT I JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU WE CONDUCTED A FOLLOW UP IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AND IN THAT REPORT WE IDENTIFY THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY NO OVERSIGHT OF REGIONAL CENTERS VENDOR SELECTION. AND BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT DDS WAS GOING TO MAINTAIN THE POSITION THAT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT WE MADE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO TRY TO COMPEL THE DEPARTMENT TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT OVERSIGHT ULTIMATELY THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING BUT AGAIN WE STAND BY THEM. THEY WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN CLOSING I WANTED I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE REPORTS I COVER TODAY. WE'RE SOMEWHAT NARROW IN SCOPE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TWO THOUSAND TEN AUDIT. THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AUDIT FOCUSED ON A VERY SMALL PROGRAM- IN TERMS OF DDS A SPENDING ONLY FIVE PERCENT. OF ITS DIRECT SERVICES BUDGET GOES TO IN HOME RESPITE SERVICES AS A VERY NARROW SCOPE. OF THE OTHER REPORT THAT WE DID THAT I'VE TOUCHED ON TODAY TEN YEARS AGO. OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY DECIDE THAT NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO CONDUCT ANOTHER STATE AUDIT. WE HAVE NEW LEADERSHIP A DDS AS EVIDENCED BY THE DIRECTOR WHO JUST SPOKE HERE BEFORE ME- THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT TONE FROM THE TOP. A IT WOULD BE VALUE ADDED TO POSSIBLY TRY TO IDENTIFY. HOW DIFFICULT IT COULD BE FOR A CONSUMER TO NAVIGATE- THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND TRIED TO OBTAIN SERVICES FROM THEM. IT ALSO MIGHT BE. BENEFICIAL TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT REGIONAL CENTERS ARE PROVIDING OF VENDORS. AND THE SAME WITH EDS AS OVERSIGHT OF REGIONAL CENTERS ALL WITH THE GOAL OF COURSE OF INCREASING THE QUALITY OF SERVICES. THE CONSUMERS ARE RECEIVING. OF THE STATE AUDITOR OF COURSE TO BE HAPPY TO CONDUCT ANY AUDIT THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTS. AND ANOTHER OF A VERY POSITIVE ASPECT OF AN AUDIT OF COURSE IS THAT WE ARE INDEPENDENT WE ARE NONPARTISAN. AND WE CONDUCT OUR REVIEWS IN ACCORDANCE WITH RIGOROUS STANDARDS. SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THOSE FACTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THAT DOES CONCLUDE MY TESTIMONY. ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE FOR. POSTED MON MISMAS WEBER AVE I WANT TO THANK YOU AYE AYE IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER MEETING BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO WAS HERE FOR YOU SEE ME SNEAK OUT TO THE NEXT MEETING HAVE A BUDGET MEETING BUT- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS COME OUT IN AND MR MULLIN REMINDED US THAT WE'RE IN AN OPPORTUNE WIN IT A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD AND IT'S INTERESTING BE I'D CARE MOST YEAR THE BUDGET WHAT FIVE YEARS AGO OR SO AND MANY OF THESE ISSUES STILL REMAIN IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING AND OBVIOUSLY THE CONSTANT TURNOVER BECAUSE WOULD NOT ADEQUATELY FUNDING AND IN TERMS OF STAFF OF THE CENTERS REGIONAL CENTERS AND ALL THOSE THINGS AND I I'M JUST HOPEFUL THAT THIS YEAR. WE WILL DO BETTER THAN WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST FOUR FEET OR SO IN TERMS OF TRYING TO CREATE THE NECESSARY FUNDING THAT WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL FOR THOSE IN THE STATE THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSIST AND HELPING THEM HAVE THE KIND OF LIFE THAT ALL OF US EXPECT TO HAVE SO I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT INFORMATION- WITH US- WITH ME TODAY AND AS IS ONE OF THE CHEERS OF THE BUDGET. I WILL DEFINITELY- BE LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT WHAT WE'VE DONE WHETHER THAT WERE RESPONDING TO THESE ISSUES THAT ARE SO CRITICAL MANY THE ISSUES YOU RAISE CAN BE SOLVED SOMETIMES BY BY MORE FUNDING JUST TO BE VERY HONEST ABOUT IT BECAUSE I FOUND WORKING WITH MY REGIONAL CENTER THERE'S SOME REALLY WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS. THERE THERE THERE THERE AND THEIR SACRIFICES MENTALLY BECAUSE OF THE LOW PAY THAT WE PROVIDE THEM AND SO SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE TO LEAVE BECAUSE THEY GET A DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITY WORKING FOR THE COUNTY OR SOME OF THE SERVICE AND UP AND THAT HARD BREAK WITH THOSE WHO HAVE TO CONTENTS OF WORK. WE HAVE OVER. THE REAL LOOK AT AND WE WANT TO. WE HAVE TO. IN TERMS OF. THIS IS REALLY THE TWO IN THE FOR TO DO. THE BRACELET AWAY FROM US AND WE A SO EVEN AND CAN. THE NEXT COUPLE OF SO I'M THAT ARE COMMITTEE WILL BE STRONG. FOR THAT AND THAT THOSE OF US ON THE WILL RECOGNIZE THAT AND I THINK OUR STAFF IS HERE AS WELL AS THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE COME AND SHARED SOME WONDERFUL STORIES WITH US REALLY WONDERFUL STORIES OF VICTORY. A IN THE MIDST OF A LOT OF CHALLENGES THAT YOU HAVE INSIDE ONE THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU SO MAYOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU AGAIN AS CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WOULD LOVE TO GET MY HANDS ON THAT ORIGINAL TWENTY TEN ON IT WHICH PREDATES MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT THE I ACTION ITEMS LEGISLATIVE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ACTED ON WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU. AS PRECISELY WHAT THOSE ARE WHERE WE'VE BEEN DELINQUENT AND NOT ACTING- IT AND- THOUSAND. I'M CURIOUS YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CASE REVIEWS THAT PART BEING DONE AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS. CAN YOU DEFINE OR DESCRIBE WHAT A REVIEW IS YES THE KEY IS AS SIMPLE AS- LOOKING THROUGH THE FILE OR IS THIS AN EXTENSIVE- LEVEL KIND OF A REVIEW THAT IT INVOLVES THAT. YOU KNOW INTERACTION WITH WITH THE PRIMARY AND OTHER ADVOCATES CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS YES THIS REVIEW IS JUST AS YOU HAD DESCRIBED IT IS VERY LIMITED. IT IS SIMPLY TO REVIEWING THE VENDOR FILE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER MAINTAINS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR LICENSING THE CERTIFICATIONS ARE UP TO DATE THAT THEY HAVE A CURRENT SERVICE DELIVERY DESIGN. OF IT'S REALLY LIMITED TO US THAT AND IT'S NOT TIME CONSUMING WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE WENT OUT TO THE FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS IS THAT'S A COUPLE WEREN'T EVEN AWARE THAT IT OF THE REQUIREMENT. AND THAT THEY NEED TO BE DOING IT SO THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PART OF THE REASON THAT IT WASN'T BEING PERFORMED. OF THE OTHER THREE SIMPLY JUST DIDN'T HAVE A PROCESS FOR DOCUMENTING THE REVIEWS BUT THEY ARE CRITICAL BECAUSE WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THOSE FILES WE FOUND THAT SOME DIDN'T HAVE UPDATED INFORMATION. AND THE RISK OF COURSE IS THAT YOU HAVE VENDORS PROVIDING SERVICES TO CONSUMERS. WHO ARE NOT QUALIFIED AND MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU AND I'LL GO BACK TO WHAT I'VE SAID IN OTHER HEARINGS WHEN IS WHEN WE HAD TO THE STATE AUDITOR. THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA REALLY NEED TO THINK THE STATE AUDITOR FOR BEING THAT ADVOCATE FOR THEM IN A YOU KNOW A NON BIASED A- ARENA. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE TODAY'S WHEN YOU SEE THIS IS GLARINGLY ABSENT IS WE HAVE NO PROVIDERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY. ON A PANEL. AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SHOW UP TODAY FOR FEAR OF REPRISAL. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE AFRAID OF VOICING OF HOW THEY FEEL THEY'VE BEEN TREATED OR OR ANY OF THAT KIND OF MANNER AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS SHOULD SHARE THAT. THEY'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE AFRAID OF BEING A PUNISHED IN DIFFERENT LOCALES AND- AND THAT THAT'S BEEN. KIND OF A COP GLARING THING THAT'S WE'VE NOTICES THE HEARINGS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE I'M JUST SAYING THAT THIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN KIND OF THE NORM FOR US. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THAT I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS THOUGH AND I. REALLY APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE OF GOING INTO THE FISCAL ANNA AND THE OVERSIGHT OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS. BUT I'VE HAD THE THOUGHT OF MAYBE THE STATE AUDITOR WOULD B ABLE TO COME IN FROM THE CLIENTS PERSPECTIVE AND WORK FOR THE CLIENT. BACK TO THE REGIONAL CENTER IN AN AUDIT. AND SEEING HOW AND WHERE THEY COULD BE DEFICIENCIES FROM THAT GOING FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE. KIND OF VALIDATION OR- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS WELL AS LEGISLATORS TO SEE HOW. OUR EXPECTATION FOR OUTCOMES IS BEING PROVIDED. OR NOT. SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO J. LACK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY. OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT. THAT OVERSIGHT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. TO MAKE SURE THAT. ASSIST FUNDING PARTNERS. THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING. THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN VALUE. AND SO AGAIN THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR DEPARTMENT- FOR GUIDING US AND THEN ON A REAL PERSPECTIVE ON HOW. THINGS REALLY ARE. YOU FOR HAVING ME AND MR MULLIN I'LL GET YOU THAT REPORT. COMING UP TO OUR LAST PANEL IT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE STATEWIDE STATEWIDE DISABILITY ADVOCATES THE CITY COUNCIL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES CINDY SMITH. AND JUST WHAT BILLY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA KATIE HORNBERGER OF FROM THE DIRECTOR OF OUR CLIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCACY. WE'RE GONNA START OFFICE IN THE FIRST. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON HELLO CHEN FRAZIER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS CINDY SMITH I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR POLICY AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS AT THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THE COUNCIL BELIEVES HAVING ACCESS TO IN RECEIVING QUALITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AS THE CORNERSTONE FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO BE SAFE HEALTHY ENSURE SELF DETERMINATION. ANY DISCUSSION OF POLICY PARTIES MUST FOCUS ON THE VALUES OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND RIGHTS ASSISTANCE ACTS THAT CREATES THE DD COUNCIL AS WELL AS THE LANHAM ACT INCLUDING CHOICE AND INCLUSION. YOU HAVE THE OPPORUNITY HERE TODAY IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW TO SELF ADVOCATES THAT ARE ON THE COUNCIL WAS THE WEATHER SPOON IN ROSY RYAN. I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO ONE BETTER TO INFORM THIS COMMITTEE OF WHAT IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THE SYSTEM. STIR WITHERSPOON. AND MS RYAN RAISE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT ISSUES FROM THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES NO TESTIMONY. AND I'M HOPING IN PLEASE BILL ROVIDES ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF SOLUTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE COUNCIL PROVIDE A GRANT TO CREATE A STATEWIDE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AS MR WHETHER SING STATED WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES WHO ARE CURRENTLY LIVING AT HOME WITH AGING CARE GIVERS HEARING CALIFORNIA. THE NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION THE COUNCIL'S FRAMEWORK WAS TO CREATE A DEDICATED HOUSING FUND FOR PEOPLE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE FRAMEWORK. IN CONCLUDED THAT WE NEED TWENTY THOUSAND NEW UNITS. THE COUNCIL'S WORKING ON A PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS BY CREATING A ONE TIME FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. GENERAL FUND HOUSING FUND AS PART OF THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM. THE FUNDING WILL PROVIDE GAPS FUNDING FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE UNITS ARMY HUNDRED MILLION IS THE SAME AMOUNT THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH TO THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. CHANGING TO THE TOPIC OF EMPLOYMENT MISTER WITHERSPOON OFFER A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED FROM PLANET BUT I OFFER THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY REPORT THE EMPLOYMENT RATE. OF WORKING AGE PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES WAS IT WAS THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. HOWEVER FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM THE PERCENTAGE IS ONLY INCREASED BY ABOUT 2% 216% IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. COUNCIL BELIEVES IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE CREATE ACROSS AGENCY STATEWIDE EMPLOYMENT STRATEGY. FOR PEOPLE DISABILITIES WITH BENCHMARKS FOR HOW TO INCREASE THE EMPLOYMENT PARTICIPATION RATE EACH YEAR TO GET CLOSER TO OUR GOAL OF HAVING AN EMPLOYMENT PARTICIPATION RATE FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES. THAT IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF PERSONS WITH. OUT JUST. HAVING INCLUDES PATIENT RATE SOMEWHERE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES SIMILAR TO THAT WITHOUT DISABILITIES. AND COMPETITIVE INTEGRATE IMPLEMENT. IN ADDITION THE STATE NEEDS TO CONTINUE ITS COMBAT MEANT TO MAKING CALIFORNIA MODEL EMPLOYER FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND WHILE IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED AND WE BELIEVE THE PROGRAM NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED AT MINIMUM THE LIMITED EDUCATION APPOINTMENT. OR THE PROGRAM IMPEDE ENGINE TRIP PROGRAM OPTIONS THAT ARE SET TO SUNSET AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE MUST BE CONTINUED I CAN REPORT TO THE COUNCIL THAT WE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE STAFF WHO APPLIED THROUGH THE LEAGUE PROGRAM UNDERSTOOD CECILIE BEEN EMPLOYED AT THE COUNCIL. IN TURN THE CONVERSATION OF RATES. THE COUNCIL FULLY SUPPORTS. THE NEEDS TO FULLY RESTORE AND PROVIDE RATE INCREASES TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM AND ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALITY SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE COUNCIL ALSO BELIEVE THAT IS-NOT POSSIBLE FOR SERVICES TO BE TRULY INDIVIDUALIZED WITH THE CURRENT HE SLOWED RATIOS AND EACH REGIONAL CENTER. THE CASE ROAD RATIOS NEED TO BE FULLY ADDRESSED THE COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE CASELOAD RATIOS THE COUNCIL IS PLEASED TO SEE THE PROPOSAL FOR YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IN ANY ADEQUATE AND COMPREHENSIVE SAFE AND NOT IS NEEDED THAT CAN MEET LEE UNTIMELY ADDRESS MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL AND OTHER NEEDS. IS A NECESSITY THAT WE MUST HAVE AGAIN THE COUNCIL'S HAPPY TO SEE THE STEPS LIMóN TAKEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY NET. THE COUNCIL IN ITS ROLE AS A GRANT MAKER THIS YEAR FUNDED A GRANT TO CREATE SERVICE OUTCOMES SPELL TAKEN ACCOUNT AN INDIVIDUAL'S PERSONAL GOALS FOR THEMSELVES. THE COUNCIL BELIEVES THAT IS CRITICAL TO CREATE CLEARLY DEFINED. CONSISTENT AND MEASURABLE SERVICE OUTCOMES TO IMPROVE SERVICES. TRAINING IN PURCHASING. THE GRANT IS KNOWN AS THE PERSON CENTERED ADVOCACY VISION AND EDUCATION OR PAVE PROJECT LEVEL PEOPLE COMPLICATE ACRONYMS. THE GRANT IS DEVELOPING ITS FRAMEWORK USING WHAT WE KNOW TO BE A CBS COMPLIANCE SERVICES. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL MEDICAID RULE GOES INTO EFFECT IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THE RULES FOCUSED ON CREATING A DEFINITION OF EACH CBS THAT IS BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SETTING. THIS MUST COME INTO COMPLIANCE OR RISK LOSING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THE PAVE PROJECT GRANTEES WILL PROVIDE TO THE COUNCIL AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER OR THE UNDER THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR FRAMEWORK FOR DELIVERY. MEASUREMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM INCLUDING HOW TO MOVE THE RATE STUDY FORWARD THE FILL THE GAP CITED IN THE RATE STUDY IN REGARDS SO MAKING SERVICE PROVIDER PAYMENTS TO QUALITY SERVICE OUTCOMES. THAT SAID IT'S CRITICAL OF THE SYSTEM CONTINUE TO BE STABILIZED GIVEN THE OUTCOMES OF THE RATE STUDY THE COUNCIL THANKS YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR THE SUPPORT THE RATE INCREASES LAST YEAR. BUT BELIEVES MORE MUST BE DONE TO CONTINUE TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM. THE COUNCIL'S HOPEFUL AT THE FRAMEWORK WILL PROVIDE THE STATE IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS WITH SERVICE OUTCOMES. THAT THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT BASED ON THE VALUES OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND BILL OF RIGHTS ASSISTANCE ACT IN THE LANHAM ACT. TO ENSURE THE PURCHASING IS BASED ON QUALITY. THAT WE TARGET RESOURCES WHERE THEY ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IN THE MEASURE THE RESULTS OF THOSE SERVICE OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CENTER BY SERVICES BUT ALLOW PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO TRANSITION TO LESS RESTRICTIVE PROGRAMS OR SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR PROVIDERS. WHO SUCCESSFULLY HELP TRANSITION A PERSON FROM A SUB MINIMUM WAGE POSITION TO SUPPORT EMPLOYMENT IN A GROUP SETTING OR SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT IN A GROUP SETTING TO COMPETITIVE INTEGRATE IMPLEMENT. THE COUNCIL ALSO BELIEVE THE IMPLEMENTATION THE RATE STUDY SHOULD BE USED AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A CAREER OPPORTUNITY WITH ADVANCEMENT FOR DISABILITY SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE NEED TO CREATE A PIPELINE TALENTED DISABILITY SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO SEE A SUSTAINABLE CAREER PATH FOR THEMSELVES AND PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICE THE COUNCIL BELIEVES IT IS TIME TO CREATE TRAINING AND CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR PROVIDERS AND PROVIDER SHOULD RECEIVE HIGHER WAGES. BASED ON THE REGIONAL TRAINING OR CREDENTIALS THEY RECEIVE. THE COUNCIL APPRECIATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVES AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN PARTICULAR ON THE RATE STUDY AS WE FINISH OUR PAVE PROJECT AND ARE ABLE TO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. TO THE LEGISLATURE IN SEPTEMBER THANK YOU THANK YOU. KATIE THANK FOR HAVING US. UP SO AND YOU KNOW I KATIE HER HEARD AND DIRECTOR THE OFFICE OF CLIENTS ADVOCACY WERE FUNDED THROUGH A CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE FREE LEGAL SERVICES TO REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS. OF IT. DEAR SEE SERVES- CLIENTS THROUGH ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS INCLUDING MINE- LAST YEAR WE ASSISTED NEARLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE OF WHICH MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND IDENTIFIED AS PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE ONLY CALL US WHEN THINGS DON'T GO WELL. SO LOOK AT AS YOU SAID EARLIER- CHAIRMAN YOU KNOW WE DON'T ALWAYS HEARTHE GOOD THINGS NOBODY CALLS ME TO TELL ME THINGS ARE GOING WELL. UNFORTUNATELY BUT HAVING BEEN IN THE SYSTEM A LONG TIME- WE HAVE- REALLY LOOKED AT THE VALUES THAT HAVE FORMED OUR SYSTEM. AND TO ME. THE SURE I. HAVE THAT WE RETURN TO THE VALUE. AND SHAPE OUR PA. FROM THE- WHEN WE LOOK TO THE VALUES THE ARE INCLUDE. INTEGRATION AND CHOICE. OF AND- THOSE COME FROM OUR VERY FOUNDATION BACK IN THE LATE SIXTIES AND HAVE NEVER LEFT OUR SYSTEM. THOSE VALUES ARE ALSO EXEMPLIFIED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN BOTH IN THE SUPREME COURT IN THE OLMSTEAD DECISION AND IN THE FINAL RULE FROM THE HUMAN HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. DEPARTMENT UP AS YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTING THAT RULE BY MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND TO DO SO INDIVIDUALS MUST BE INTEGRATED INTO THE COMMUNITY TO THE SAME DEGREE AS PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES ALL SERVICE SETTINGS MUST OFFER INCLUSION AND COMMUNITY INTEGRATION. AND PLANNING FOR SERVICES NEEDS TO BE INDIVIDUALLY DETERMINED AND FOCUSED ON THE PERSON'S UNIQUE GOALS AND NEEDS. THIS WILL PARTICULARLY IMPACT SEGREGATED SITE BASED DAY AND SHELTERED WORKSHOP PROGRAMS AT WHICH WILL NEED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE FUNDING RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES WILL ALSO NEED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING CHOICE OF ROOMMATE OR TO HAVE A SINGLE ROOM. LOCKABLE DOORS FLEXIBLE MEAL TIMES FLEXIBLE VISITING HOURS AND READY ACCESS TO FOOD AS DESIRED BY THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN THE HOME. THE OTHER PIECE TO LOOK AT WHEN WE THINK OF OUR VALUES IS TO THINK ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE LIVE GENERALLY. THE SYSTEM WAS FOUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO DID NOT WANT TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THEIR CHILDREN THEY WANTED A SERVICE SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE A REALISTIC ALTERNATIVE. AND KEEP HELP KEEP THEIR CHILDREN SAFELY AT HOME AND ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO PROSPER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS OVER CHILDREN LIVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES. MANY OF WHOM UNFORTUNATELY OR FORCED TO PROVIDE UNPAID CARE IN THE FACE OF AN ADEQUATE SUPPORTS THROUGH AYE HSS AND OTHER PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMS. THE PROBLEM IS MOST ACUTE FOR OUR CLIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THOSE CAN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. IN OUR SYSTEM WE HAVE STAGGERING SPENDING DISPARITIES. BOTH BY COLOR AND BY LANGUAGE AND THIS IS DESPITE MULTI YEAR EFFORTS TO REDUCE THESE DISPARITIES. WHEN WE LOOK TO RATE REFORM EFFORTS. AND THE EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THIS YEAR THESE MUST BE TIED TO OUTCOMES THAT WILL ADVANCE THESE VALUES. OF. AND WE SUPPORT AND APPRECIATE THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WAS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IT THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES IN THE SERVICE DELIVERY AND IN THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DECEPTIVEELEMENTAL DISABILITIES WHICH IS WHAT WE CARE MOST ABOUT IS THE LIVED EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE. AS WE THINK ABOUT POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ONCE AGAIN WE NEED TO GO TO THE VALUES OF INCREASING COMMUNITY INTEGRATION INCLUSION AND CHOICE. WE SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZING INTEGRATION RELATED OUTCOMES THAT TAKE A GREATER URGENCY GIVEN THE TIME LINE OF THE FINAL RULE. CALIFORNIA RECEIVED TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL MEDICAID FUNDING TO PROVIDE H. CBS SERVICES AND AS A CONDITION OF THIS FUNDING WE NEED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINAL RULE WE NEED TO START NOW IN IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGES TO THOSE. PROGRAM PROVIDERS. AND WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH OUR INCENTIVES. THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM MUST ALSO REWARD EXCELLENCE NOT JUST COMPLIANCE. ALL RIGHT I MEAN COMPLIANCE IS WHAT YOU DO BECAUSE THE LAW TELLS YOU YOU HAVE TO EXCELLENCE AND GOING BEYOND THAT IS WHAT YOU DO TO GET AN INCENTIVE. OF AND SO. WHAT WE EXPECT EVERYONE TO YOU KNOW PERFORM TO WHAT'S ALIGN TO ALIGN WITH THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. THAT SHOULDN'T ALONE LEAD TO A FINANCIAL AWARD. INSTEAD WE SHOULD REWARD PARTICIPANTS THAT PURSUIT INNOVATIVE GOAL ABOVE AND ON THE PRE EXISTING LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND CREATE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY OPERA INTEGRATION PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AND CHOICE. PRIORITY SHOULD ALSO BE PLACED ON RECENT LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES SUCH AS REDUCING RELIANCE ON THE USE OF INSTITUTES FOR MENTAL DISEASE AND OTHER VERY RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS. AS WELL AS REDUCING THE SPENDING DISPARITIES THAT EXIST BETWEEN CONSUMERS FROM COMMUNITIES COLOR. A COMMUNITY WERE WHITE AND BUT IN AND ENGLISH SPEAKING CONSUMERS. WE HAVE A FEW IDEAS OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT COULD BE USED IN PERFECT DEVELOPING PERFORMANCE MEASURES. IN THE AREA OF EMPLOYMENT WESLEY AND CINDY BOTH SPOKE ABOUT THE LOW EMPLOYMENT RATES OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND WE REALLY SHOULD BE- DRAFTING PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT RELATE TO INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH IDT TO PARTICIPATE IN COMMUNITY COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. IN INDUSTRIES AND JOBS OF THEIR CHOICE AND WE SHOULD WORK TOWARD HASING OUT- SEGREGATED SETTINGS THAT HAVE SUB MINIMUM WAGE AS ROSY TALKED ABOUT NOT BE WANTING TO BE PAID LESS THAN SOMEONE ELSE FOR THE SAME JOB. UP WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WE COULD CREATE. WE COULD LOOK THROUGH A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS TO CHOOSE THEIR IN INDUSTRY AND JOB FROM SEVERAL OPTIONS. LOOKING FOR INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING ADEQUATE TRAINING TO SUCCEED IN THEIR JOB. AND TO LOOK TOWARD INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING ALL OF THE NECESSARY SUPPORTS AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS AT THEIR WORK PLACE. IN ADDITION TO PERFORMANCE MEASURES RELATED TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMPETITIVE AN INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT PERFORMANCE MEASURES SEARCH SHOULD ALSO ESTABLISH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN SEGREGATED. SETTINGS WHERE THEY MAKE SUB MINIMUM WAGE. WHEN WE LOOK TO THE HOME BASED COMMUNITY SETTINGS ROLE IN RESIDENTIAL AND NON RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS A WE CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON PEOPLE WITH IDT MAKING CHOICES- WITHIN THE RULES ABOUT WHERE AND WITH WHOM THEY WANT TO LIVE. OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR DAY PROGRAMS SHOULD CAN MEASURE WHETHER EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT MULTIPLE PROGRAMS TO OBSERVE THEM BEFORE THEY BEGIN AND ONE. THIS SHOULD INCLUDE PROGRAMS THAT WILL LINK IN. SUPPORT THEM IN COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE SPEND IN THE COMMUNITY INSTEAD OF A SITE BASED PROGRAMS. AS I MENTIONED INSTITUTES FOR MENTAL DISEASE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA'S BECOME A LITTLE BIT OF A BROKEN RECORD ON OVER THE YEARS IN NOT WANTING THOSE THOSE USED SO WHEN WE LOOK TO IT WAITING INSTITUTE INSTITUTIONALIZATION WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS THE DEPARTMENT AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS. HAVE MADE TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF THE STATE OPERATED DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND WAS VERY EXCITED TO HEAR-DIRECTOR PART AND SAY WE HAVE ONE PERSON LEFT THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE TO BE PROUD OF. TO DO SO THOUGH WE NEED TO. BUILD A SAFE A COMMUNITY SAFETY NET FOR OUR INDIVIDUALS- AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS TROUBLING IS THE RECENT AT DDS INITIATIVE EXPANDING INSTITUTIONAL CARE AT CANYON SPRINGS AND PORTIONS OF PORTERFIELD DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. IN THE INCREASING RELIANCE ON ON AYE EMPTIES. WE SHOULD HAVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ON THAT SS SUCCESS IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS PLACED IN INSTITUTIONS- AS WELL AS FOCUSING PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS ON DIVERTING PLACEMENT IN AN INSTITUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND LASTLY SERVICE DISPARITIES- DESPITE RECENT INCREASED ATTENTION ON THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE DISPARITIES. THEY CONTINUE TO EXIST A REJECTION OF THE SPENDING DISPARITY SHOULD BE A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF ANY OUTCOME DRIVEN PROGRAM. SAID WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY AS HE SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER- TO EAT YOU KNOW REALLY LOOK AT PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND USE THIS WINDOW WELL- AND I HOPE THAT WITH THAT WERE ABLE TO CRAFT SOME VERY- GOOD PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT BENEFIT THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MR MODE. SO AGAIN I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU BEING HERE TODAY AND CAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO IS WHEN YOU COME WITH SUGGESTIONS THAT AFFECTS SOMETHING.

THEN SYSTEMATICALLY STAR FOR GENERATION- HAVE IMPROVE WHERE THEY SPEND EVERY CENT IS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES- REGARDING OUR REGIONAL CENTER REGIS SORT OF THE EAST BAY THEY DO A FANTASTIC JOB- SO I'M NOT A AFRAID HERE TODAY THAT TO SAY YOU KNOW HOW THEIR PERFORMANCES THEY DO A GREAT JOB THEY TREAT US GREAT- BUT THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING WITH THEIR CASE LOAD. RULES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING- SO IT'S A SYSTEM WIDE WE HAVE THESE ISSUES- I WISH SEVERAL MOMENTS THE SERVER IS FATHER APPEAR. WE CAME IN AND OUT TOGETHER- IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RATE STUDY. LIKE INTEREST YEAH BUT ABOUT THINGS THAT WHAT ABOUT STUDY. I HAD. THIS IS A FIFTY YEAR.

MY NAME IS KELLY MCMILLAN AND I REPRESENT REYES CARE RIGHT SPRINGS- CENTERS WERE THE LARGEST PRIVATE PROVIDER FOR ICF. CALIFORNIAN COUNTRY. AND TO MENTION HERE A FEW TIMES ABOUT THE BUDGET OPPORTUNITIES AND SO. AS YOU KNOW ICF DDS WERE THE FIRST PROVIDERS TO EVER PRO- PAY A PROVIDER TAX TO HELP OFFSET THE GENERAL FUND. BUT UNFORTUNATELY- THE RATES HAVE BEEN FROZEN FOR TWELVE YEARS. AND PROVIDERS HAVE NO OTHER WAY TO RAISE REVENUES BECAUSE THEY DEPEND ON MEDI CAL PROGRAM. AND DUE TO THIS RATE FREEZE RISE CARE- RIGHT SPRINGS HEALTH HAS HAD TO PUT IN A- PUT IN THE POSITION OF ACTUALLY CLOSING. AND CONSOLIDATING OUR HOMES ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGH MARKET LOCATIONS THAT WAS MENTIONED TODAY AS WELL. AND EVEN WITH THE RATE- ADD ONS FOR CERTAIN MANDATORY LABOR AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT ESCALATING COSTS AND- TREMENDOUS PRESSURE IT TO PROVIDE IT PUTTING PRESSURE TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE QUALITY SERVICES WE NEED TO DO. IF THE RATE FREEZE IS MAINTAINED A RIGHT AND A RATE ADJUSTMENT TO KEEP AT LEAST UP TO CPI'S NOT PROVIDED. A RISK OF JEOPARDIZING THE SERVICES.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY WESTLING I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES. AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING ALL TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE STATE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY AS WE HEARD THIS AFTERNOON. DURING CREDIBLE DEDICATED STAFF FIRST AND FOREMOST MISTER FRAZIER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW US AND GETTING TO KNOW OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S NO SMALL FEAT TO TRAVERSE UP AND DOWN THE STATE HOLDING HEARINGS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND APPRECIATE IT. BECAUSE IT REALLY PROVIDES PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET TO SACRAMENTO THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL THEIR STORIES- AND AS WE SAW HERE TODAY. IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVED BY THE SYSTEM AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL STORIES TO TELL. THIS SYSTEM AS DIRECTOR BRIDGMAN POINTED OUT HAS HIT A- TIPPING POINT A MILESTONE IF YOU WILL. IN TERMS OF WE ARE EIGHT. 101% COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE LONG TERM PLANS FOR PEOPLE WE NO LONGER HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESIDING IN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AS THEIR FOREVER HOMES. AND THIS PRESENTS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS OF THE SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM IS SEEKS TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH THREE BIG THINGS FIRST EARLY INTERVENTION TO HELP YOUNG CHILDREN CATCH UP. DEVELOPMENTALLY TO THEIR SAME AGE PEERS SECOND FAMILY SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND SERVICES TO HELP FAMILIES WHO. ARE MAINTAINING A CHILD AT HOME TO BE ABLE TO DO SO AND I APPRECIATE IN THE SURVEY RESULTS. SOME OF THE NOTATIONS ABOUT THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO FAMILIES THAT ENABLE THEM TO CONTINUE WORKING AND BALANCING THE CARE NEEDS OF THEIR CHILD. AND THIRD WE KNOW THAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS HELPING PEOPLE. WHO ARE ADULTS TO ACHIEVE THE GREATEST LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE POSSIBLE. AND WE HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EMPLOYMENT TRANSPORTATION AND OVERALL THESE THINGS LEAD TO COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP. AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST GOAL OF THE SYSTEM HELPING PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. TO BECOME FULL MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND TO ENGAGE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS FULL MEMBERS. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. THE REGIONAL CENTERS LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE NEEDS OF THE SYSTEM WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE. AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION THANK YOU. THANK ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE STOP OF THE MIKE FROM CALM. OKAY SO FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND PARTICIPATING IN THE HEARING. HELLO OF MEETING ALL OF YOU. I WANT TO AGAIN THANK ARM ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF WALDRON MULLIN MEDINA AND WEBER TODAY FOR SHARING THIS. HEARING TODAY. I WANT TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY BUT THEY'RE SO BUSY DOING OTHER MEETINGS AND THAT HIS YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW MUCH IT MEANT FOR THEM TO BE HERE. WITH A BUSY SCHEDULE SPENDING THE TIME THAT THEY DID IT'S AMAZING. HI I THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM FOR THAT. HOME I'D LIKE TO BID ALL OF YOU CAN BUY. JUST SAYING I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOU ALL TO BE HERE TODAY. FEW THINGS THAT IN THE CLOSING. THE SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES HAS ENTERED FLUCTUATING LEVELS OF SUPPORT FROM THE STATE OVER THE PAST DECADE. PAST SEVERAL DECADES. YET THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHITE EIGHTY D. CONTINUES TO RISE. OVER THE LAST DECADE WE HAVE SEEN OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW CONSUMERS. ENTER THE SYSTEM. MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE NOW THESE ARE CALIFORNIANS. NOW BEING SERVICED AND WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE MORE. WE HAVE WE HAVE SEEN A FEW GAINS IN OUR STATE BUDGETS TO MEET THESE NEEDS AND THEY'VE BEEN INCREMENTAL THE BEST. PARTICULAR THE BUDGET WE PASSED LAST YEAR DOES INCLUDE A RATE INCREASE FOR SUS SERVICE PROVIDERS. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE GOING INTO THE SYSTEM. THERE ARE CURRENT PROPOSALS O EXTEND SOME OF THESE INCREASES AND INTRODUCE FISCAL ROOF REFORMS. BUT THE STATE STILL HAS NOT DONE NEARLY ENOUGH. THE ADD COMMUNITIES BEING LEFT BEHIND WHILE OTHER AREAS OF SOCIAL SAFETY NETS ARE BEING FULLY FUNDED. IT'S NOT FAIR. THE INCREASE FUNDING FOR IT PROGRAMS THE BUDGET PROVIDED HAS ONLY BEEN IN EFFECT FOR TWENTY EIGHT DAYS. AND THE FACT THAT IS SOME PROGRAMS WERE NOT ABLE TO WAIT. FOR THAT- THE TIME THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. I'VE HEARD OF CLOSURES IN MY AREA AND I'M SURE OTHERS ARE ALSO AFFECTED. THAT'S JUST WRONG. I HAVE TO GO BACK TO A MOTHER THAT I- WORKED ON HER CASE. AND SHE SAID IT WAS EASIER FOR HER TO GO ON WELFARE THAN TRYING TO FIND ADVOCATE SO THAT SHE COULD FIGHT FULL TIME FOR HER SON. SHE WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP HER CAREER. TO PROVIDE A OF FUTURE LIFE FOR HER SON. THAT'S WRONG. WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MORTALITY RATE ON MARRIAGE IS ABOUT 85% WHEN YOU HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS FAMILY. WE NEED TO DO BETTER TO SUPPORT THAT FAMILY UNIT. WHERE PROGRAMS ARE STILL STRUGGLING BECAUSE OUR STATE. LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S AND NOW OUR CURRENT LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR HAVE ONLY GIVEN THE SYSTEM TO INCREASES. IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. DESPITE THE COMPLETION OF THE RATE STUDY. WHICH CONFIRMS A CURRENT BUDGET FOR OF SHORTFALL OF AT LEAST ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. WISHES THAT'S DEBATABLE COULD BE AND SHOULD BE PROBABLY MORE THERE'S STILL NO STRATEGIC PLAN TO PHASE IN ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS. FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS THE IDT COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ASKED TO WAIT. FOR AN AUDIT TO FINISH I'M FOR RACE DAY TO BE COMPLETED. AND FOR SOME FUNDING TO TAKE IN FACT. I'M HERE TO SAY. THERE'S NO MORE REASON TO WAIT. IT'S TIME TO. MAKE PROGRESS WE NEED TO MAKE A PLAN AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT NOW. UNTIL WE HAVE A PLAN WE CAN SIMPLY WE CAN'T SIMPLY ABANDON THESE PROGRAMS A WRIST SOME FALLING APART BECAUSE WE THINK. THERE MIGHT BE CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM THREE YEARS FROM NOW. THE DEPARTMENT OF ALMOST SERVICES AS FINALIZE A RACE STUDY TO ADDRESS SOME SERIOUS FLAWS. AND WE ALL SEE THE POTENTIAL OF A PATH FOR A VERY PROMISING PATH FORWARD BUT AS MY MEMBERS OF THE KNOWLEDGE TO. NEEDS TO BE NOW. IT IS OUR JOB TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT NECESSARY TO COMPEL THE CREATION OF A PLAN EXCUSE ME AND INVEST THE RESOURCES INTO THIS COMMUNITY. THREE STUDY SAYS WE ARE UNDER FUNDING THIS SYSTEM. AND SO WHAT'S ARE ALL THAT. WE KNOW WE'RE UNDERFUNDING IT. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE THE MONEY IN A WAY THAT WE CAN VALUE IT. ELIZABETH FOR. WE DO DO WE DO TO THAT NEED TO MAKE THAT. WE NEED TO DO MORE. AND I KNOW EACH OF YOU WILL HELP US GET THERE. I ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE BECAUSE I WOULD INCOME I WAS IN YOUR SHOES. I'D OF FLIPPED TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH YOU GUYS HAVE THE PATIENCE OF JOB AND THANK GOD FOR THAT. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE.

WILL MOVE FORWARD- A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THERE DOES NEED TO BE LEGISLATION. ADVANCED BUT WE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE THIS LEGISLATURE CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOU. OKAY SO LET'S PARTNER UP. AND IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE TO YOUR. IT'S TIME IT IS TIME AND PROMISES WERE MADE THOSE PROMISES NEED TO BE KEPT. WITH THAT I A BID YOU A DO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND THIS HEARINGS.
