WHICH IS WHY A MEASURE APPROACH ISN'T. WHEN MAKING DECISIONS REGARDING HOW TO RETURN YOU. TO COUNTY. AFFECTED BY DOWN. BASED ON. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRANS OF CARE IS COORDINATED IS CRITICAL.

THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PRESENT AND THAT WILL- AND MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISS LOU SEVERAL- NEXT WE HAVE THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. AND MORNING SENATOR ALL I'M KATHLEEN HOWARD KATIE HOWARD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PSEC IS THE AUDIO OKAY YES GREAT- HELLO SENATORS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE FUNDING THAT IS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. MILLION DOLLARS. TWENTY MILLION FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR HOW THAT FUNDING WILL GO OUT AND IN GENERAL TERMS THIS PROPOSAL RESPONDS TO VERY PRESSING AND CURRENT AND TIME SENSITIVE NEEDS FOR THE COUNTIES TO MODERNIZE AND UPDATE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING THESE IMPORTANT GOALS DJJ REALIGNMENT AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT FROM DOCTOR BULLS AND FROM DIRECTOR THE CERRO- THE SERVICES. ARE NOW GOING TO BE THAT RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT THE NUMBERS OF USERS WHO ARE STILL IN DJJ AND- WHO ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE IN COUNTY CARE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS- ON THE- NEED TO REMAIN ON THAT POLICY CALLS AT THIS. SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMMATIC CHANGE AT THE STATE LEVEL- TO INCLUDE THAT THE PROGRAMMING AND TREATMENT SUPPORTS ARE THERE POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT- SERVICES NEED TO BE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE TRAUMA INFORMED AND- THE CHEAP THE GOAL OF KEEPING YOUNG PEOPLE CLOSER TO HOME- ON. COUNTIES NEED TO A TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT BEST OPPORTUNE POSSIBLE AND THERE IS A CONCERN I THINK SURE BY ALL THAT IF THE COUNTY DOESN'T FEEL THEY'RE PREPARED TO MEET THOSE NEEDS THAT THERE COULD BE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE TRANSFER TO ADULT CRIMINAL COURT. WITH DJJ IS NO LONGER AN OPTION THE COUNTIES ARE MOVING REALLY QUICKLY AND THEY NEED TO BE READY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- AND THAT LENDS TO THE URGENCY OF GETTING THIS FINDING OUT UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME UP FROM THE L. A. O. AND- IN THE COMMITTEE AGENDA ABOUT SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT NEED TO BE PRESENT. FOR THAT- YOU KNOW TO ALL COME TOGETHER SO AS DIRECTOR OF THE SEVERAL MENTIONED THAT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY PLANS HAVE BEEN. SUBMITTED I'M AND PROPOSAL- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR A HUNDRED. NOT TO BE IN THE NUMBER OF BEDS COUNTY I KNOW THERE BEEN SOME IF UP IN A COUPLE OF CON ABOUT FINDING THAT THE STATE HAS HAD PROVIDED OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS SO YOUR EIGHTY ONE THAT WAS TO MEET A VERY POLICY NEED TO ABOUT TWO YEARS- WHEN JOURNAL REALIGNMENT FIRST BEGAN- ON THE COUNTY'S WERE GOING TO BE RECEIVING MORE- USE IN THEIR CARE AND AT THAT TIME MORE VETS WERE NEEDED THIS IS A DIFFERENT TIME AND A DIFFERENT NEED AND THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE TO BE FUNDED WITH THIS ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OKAY THE SPACE AND MAKING LOCAL FACILITY. CONDUCIVE FOR THE KIND OF BANNING AND TREATMENT- RESIDENTIAL NEEDS AND RE ENTRY NEEDS FOR ALL OF YOU SAID THE SYSTEM NOW INCLUDING THE USER WOULD HAVE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN DJJ PRIOR TO REALIGNMENT- DIRECTOR ZERO TOUCHED ON THIS BUT THE PENDING REGULATIONS FOR SECURE YOU DROPPED. OUT SECURING TREATMENT FACILITIES WILL BEGIN OUR BOARD WILL LAUNCH THAT PROCESS NEXT WEEK- AND AS DIRECTOR THE SIR MENTION SHE'S AGREED TO PARTICIPATE ON THE EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE. TO DEVELOP THOSE REGULATIONS WORK WE'RE CONTINUING TO COLLABORATE ALL OF THIS YEAR. BILITY IS WITHOUT Y. C. R. TURNING TO THE NEED THAT- COUNTIES HAVE THEY WERE ARE. YES CONDUCTED A SURVEY ON IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NINE POINT IX MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ALLOCATED OUT. UNDER SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE AND THAT WAS USED TO MEET SOME OF THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS BUT THIS THIS FUNDING IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS A BROADER RANGE OF FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COUNTIES. AND THESE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE IMPROVING OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL AND OPEN SPACE UPDATING AND UPGRADING HOUSING UNITS FOR PURCHASING FURNITURE THAT CAN CREATE A MORE HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT AND THIS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS- SOFTENING THE INSTITUTIONAL STEEL- SOME COUNTIES YOU NEED FUNDING TO UPDATE CAMERAS AND OTHER KINDS OF TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORTS. AND THEY'RE COUNTIES HAVE NEEDS FOR SPACE FOR MODERNIZE CLASSROOMS OUR CLASSROOMS FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES AS WELL AS TRAINING ON THE JOB TRAINING VOCATIONAL TRAINING. I'M RIGHT HI. I'M ALSO PLEASE MIND THAT THE COUNTY JAIL. THESE ARE QUITE FOR. SO IMPROVEMENTS BY ADDING PLUMBING FOR TOILETS ARE SO. SINK IN THE USE LEADING ROOM- WOULD BE AN EXAM OF AN- AND REALLY QUITE COSTLY UPGRADE SO THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT AND TIME SENSITIVE NEEDS TO IMPROVE. AND UPDATE THE FACILITIES- WE'RE ACTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE- AND FIND ABOUT. LAST EXPEDITE YOUR WORKING OF THESE IN WILL CAN TO THAT I WE KNOW THAT MORE AND FOR IS ME. AND CERTAINLY THE THAT IN THE AT ABOUT- IN. THE FUNDING. IS SPENT ON WHAT'S AND TO DO WE WITH ALL SORTS OF AND AND OTHER GET THOSE. NEED TO BE OUT IN THE- AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY. YOU HAVE. GREAT I THANK YOU HOWARD. HOW WE MOVE NOW TO SEE IF- FINANCE. HAVE A OF. I DON'T THINK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTE I SPECIFIC COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. HAPPY AND AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU ISSUE IT- THE L. A. O. ANY COMMENTS. HI THERE. I YEAH WE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND STAFF MY NAME'S ORLANDO SANCHEZ WITH THE L. A. L. AND WE WANT WE JUST WANTED PRIVACY COMMENTS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECHECK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED COUNTY OPERATED JUVENILE FACILITY GRANTS PROGRAM BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ON HOW IT ARRIVED AT THE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE AND IT IS NOT CLEAR BY THE ADDITIONAL. THIS NASA. THANK YOU. THAT LED TO OUR RIGHT AND THAT ARE ALL IN THE- PRIMARILY THE UPPER IS NOT BASED ON ASSESSMENT OF FACILITY NEED. SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATOR CONDUCTED A SURVEY TO DETERMINE WHETHER COUNTIES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. ASSESSMENT BEEN CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC DEFICIENCIES OR SHOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH COUNTY FACILITY NEEDS ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR. OR NOT ADEQUATE TO PROVIDE THE REHAB SERVICES TO THE REAL LINE USE. THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PROPOSED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITION WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER COUNTIES ARE IN NEED OF THIS FUNDING. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TWO THINGS YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR DRIVEN OUT COUNTY FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED BED SPACE SOME REPAIRS THAT- ARE ONLY RECENTLY COMING ON LINE. IS NEWLY CONSTRUCTED SPACES MAY BE BETTER CONDITION AND MORE CONDUCIVE FOR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. THE SECOND ONE IS THAT COUNTIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTRACT WITH EACH OTHER FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR NEEDS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME COUNTIES MAN FACILITY NEEDS PARTNER WITH A DIFFERENT COUNTY IN A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE PSEC. AFTER REALIGNMENT SHOWED THAT SOME COUNTIES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TAKING REALIGNED YEARS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IN THE CASE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ABLE TO PROVIDE A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THOSE COUNTY FACILITY NEEDS THAT pCONSTRUCTED BATES. AND THE INABILITY TO PARTNER WITH OTHER COUNTIES IN THE FUTURE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THE GRANTS AT THAT TIME. AND THE LAST TIME WE PLAY TO MAKE ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL A- IT IS EXCLUDABLE UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT AND AS A REMINDER TO THE LEGISLATURE THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IMPOSES A LIMIT. ON THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THE STATE CONCRETE EACH YEAR ALSO CALLED THE CELL. STATE CANNING EXCLUDES CERTAIN APPROPRIATIONS FROM THIS CALCULATION. AS SUCH IF THE LEGISLATURE. DECIDES TO REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT WOULD NEED TO REPURPOSE THE SALUTE ASSOCIATED FUNDING FOR OTHER SAU RELATED PURPOSES. HAPPY TO ADDITIONAL. THANK YOU MISTER SANCHEZ- WE NOW- I TURNED TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE IN THE COMMITTEE- FOR YOUR COMMENTS ARE QUESTIONS FROM FROM THE PANEL- I JUST WANT TO START IF I CAN WITH PROBABLY FOR THE- ADMINISTRATION BUT ARE RELATED TO THE DJ JAKE UP CLOSURE COULD YOU SUM UP WHAT YOU BELIEVE ARE THE MAIN CHALLENGES. THAT WOULD YOU KNOW OF RELATED TO THE CLOSURE- YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO YOU SEE HANDLING THOSE- ON MAJOR CHALLENGES. YES SO- I DO YOU SEE AS AS I MENTIONED ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE HAVE RESTARTING STOPPING WHICH IS ONE. OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND DJ ARE VERY FOCUSED ON FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THAT- IT WAS DISGUSTING THAT WITH THE- THAT WE WOULD MAKE SURE TO ENGAGE AGGRESSIVELY- EARLY IN THE YEAR WHICH WE HAVE DONE- I THINK BECAUSE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR REHABILITATIVE PASSAGE. RESULTED A FASHION WITH THE YOUTH IN OUR CARE THROUGH CLOSURE THAT IS WHY. RESULTING THAT ISSUE AND WE'RE THROUGH IS CRITICAL. THANK YOU FROM. GIVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT AT THIS POINT IS PROJECTING OVER FOUR HUNDRED YOUTH REMAINING AT DJJ ON THE CLOSURE DATE- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS OR PLANS FOR TRANSFERRING THE USED TO THE COUNTIES. AND I WILL CHRISTIAN FIRST CAN ADDRESS. HOT REJECTION THE NUMBERS IS- AS I MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE YEARS AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO THAT DISCHARGED PRIOR TO JUNE. OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON IS BUSINESS GOES BACK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF A REHABILITATIVE. MISSION IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU THOSE SERVICES IN THE HOPES THAT THEY ARE THEY'RE WORKING TOWARDS THOSE TREATMENT GOALS AND WHEN THEY GO IN FRONT OF THE PAROLE BOARD HAVE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO DISCHARGE AND GO BACK TO THE COUNTIES. WHICH WOULD BE OUR CURRENT PROCESSES THEY WOULD GO INTO A RE ENTRY. GO TO RE ENTRY HERE. AND THEN- AFTER INJURY AS WE DO NOW THERE'S. MAKING SURE THERE'S AT DEPENDING UPON WHAT THE USERNAME FOR PLACE AND SUPER. FOR THOSE YOU CAN'T JUST- AND ALSO THAT THOSE. WE FOLK ON AGAIN THOSE. PAROLE AND SO IT IS FLUENT IN TERMS OF THOSE NUMBERS FOR YOU HAVE THAT POSSIBILITY AND SO FOR THOSE USE THAT DOWN ON OUR END WE'RE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON AGAIN THROUGH CLOSURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE GOALS AND THEN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AROUND THAT INDIVIDUAL TRANSFER PLAN. THAT ONE FITS ONE MILE AND I. ONE KEEP EMPHASIZING BECAUSE I THINK THAT. BECOME AN IMPORT CHALLENGE AND ONE THAT I KNOW MY AND OUR ARE VERY FOLK ON IS AGAIN RACKING EACH YEAR THIS GONNA TO PRO JEFF SUPERVISION DIFFERENCE- SUPPORT SYSTEMS BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND SO WE WILL NEED TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATIONS FOR EACH OF THOSE YEARS AS TRANSFER BACK TO THE COUNTIES. MMHM THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO IT SEEMS LIKE. WE HAVE ARE YOU THAT ARE GOING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE COUNTY THE COUNTY NEED TO BE READY WITH ALL THE SERVICES AND- OFF FOR THOSE YOUTH WE HAVE YOUTH THAT ARE. NOT YET READY NOT GOING TO BE TRANSFERRED HOPEFULLY BEFORE. THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY BAKLOH. AND THEN THEY'LL STILL BE A NEED FOR SOME NUMBER OF YOUTH ARM THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUR SUPPORTED BY STATE IS THAT. THAT MAKES SENSE THAT SORT OF ORDER AND THEN- BASIC NEEDS. REALLY AT DIFFERENT GROUPS IS THAT GROUP THAT CAN'T CONTINUE WITH OUR REGULAR PROCESSES BEACH CHARGE PRIOR TO THAT JUNE THIRTIETH DATE AND THOSE YOU'RE HERE. AREN'T ON TO DISCHARGE BY THAT JUNE THIRTIETH SEPT TWENTY TWENTY THREE DATE AND WILL NEED TO CONTINUED SUPPORT AND TREATMENT AS THEY RETURNED. TO THE COUNTY. OKAY THANK YOU- WITH REGARDS TO THE FACILITIES- THAT'S- EARNED HOWARD FILE WITH REGARD TO THE FACILITIES CAN YOU JUST DESCRIBE A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU UP APPROACH GO TO SO THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH OF CONTINUED LIKE ENVIRONMENT FOR THOSE YOUTH AN UPGRADE IN MY AGE I'M NOT A DOCTOR. HE. ANY HOW. THE- THE PLAN AND I THINK THE THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THE THAT THE BUDGET MAKERS PROCESS YOU KNOW COULD YOU I THINK THAT THAT THE PLAN THAT THEY CAN HAVE SUBMITTED AND THAT AWAITS YOU IS IN THE OF REVIEWING- YOU KNOW WHAT WE WILL FIND IN THERE ARE ALL RIGHTY- APPROACHES TO IMPLEMENTATION THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE- PUT TOGETHER TO COVER THE CONTINUUM NEED. YOUNG IN. COLLUDING THE USER FORM ON MY HAVE BEEN HOUSED DJ JAY SO THE NEEDS- ACROSS THE COUNTRY WELCOME FROM THE PLANS- I IMAGINE THAT SOME CONVERSATION HERE ABOUT HOW TO ENSURE WHAT THE PRIORITY- APPROACHES SHOULD BE WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THAT WE COULD ALL WORK OUT. AT THE- CHANCE THAT WE ARE HEARING ABOUT FROM THE COUNTY IS ABOUT- NEEDING THE PROGRAMMING IT TREATMENT MEANS HAVING A SPACE THAT'S CONDUCIVE TO REHABILITATION AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND BETTER CLASSROOM SPACES REALLY ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES IN BRINGING DJJ UNDER THE OLD MODEL IS THAT THAT THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE. MIGHT BE UNDER COUNTY SUPERVISION FOR A LARGER NUMBER OF YEARS YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON ON WHAT THE ISSUE IS WITH NEEDS QUITE- TREATMENT IN PROGRAMMING TO ADDRESS PERHAPS MORE SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR. THIS PROGRAMMING FOR A SEX OFFENDERS AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO- WHEN I HEAR YOU SAY MADAM CHAIR WE DON'T WANT MORE PRISON LIKE ENVIRONMENTS THAT THEY CAN LEVEL THOSE ARE THE SAME CONVERSATIONS THAT THE COUNTIES ARE HAVING TO. SO HOW CAN YOU ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT KIND OF HOUSING IS AVAILABLE AS WELL AS TREATMENT AND SERVICES AND EHABILITATION ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF MEATS. OKAY THANK YOU NOT NOT DOCTORS NOT DR HOWARD. ONLY A MASTER'S DEGREE OKAY MASTER POWER- OKAY JUST TURNED TO MY COLLEAGUES AND FOUND FOR ANY OR COMMENTS. YES SENATE. YOU OKAY COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT QUESTION A U. S. HIM- I'VE FIRST WAS WHEN ASSEMBLY EXCITED ABOUT WORLD THIS IS GOING AND- EVEN MORE EXCITED TO SEE. WHAT A TREMENDOUS TEAM. WE HAVE FOR YOU HAVE- IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO JUST PRESENTED- DIRECTOR WAS ZERO I'M GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME NOT REFERRING TO THE JUDGE WAS ZERO- BASED ON YOUR BACKGROUND. I HAVE A QUESTION IS ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE A- I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS BUT DON'T WANT ONE OF THEM HAS IS A- IS KIND OF A NATURAL. SEGUE IF YOU WILL. TO THE LAST QUESTION RICHARD JUST PASSED IN THE RESPONSE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACILITIES DOLLARS- YOU KNOW THERE WERE DELIBERATING OVER TO SOME DEGREE. THE QUESTION IN MY MIND AND BELIEVE ME I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN. BONNIES IN PENN WHAT. THEY NEED- IN HIS WORDS SOME OF THEM ARE ARE MUCH BETTER OFF THAN OTHERS AS MORE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE YOU KNOW BASED ON MY OWN BACKGROUND OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT- THE PARTY UP TO THE LAST QUESTION OF THE LAST TWO QUESTIONS WAS ABOUT- YOU KNOW THIS WONDERFUL INSIGHT THAT ALL YOU HAVE BEEN TO INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT. IN IN THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. IN OTHER RESOURCES AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A QUESTION FOR. DIRECTOR SIR OR- MISS HOWARD- WHICH OF YOU. BY AT WHAT POINT DO WE START LOOKING AT FURTHER DIRECTING. THE FACILITIES DOLLARS WITH REFERENCE TO THE POLICY AROUND. THOSE THINGS INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT I MEAN THERE'S IN A- JUST. WHO THAT'S THE QUESTION I WILL TELEGRAPH MY OPINION WHICH IS THAT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITY SHOULD BE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITIES AND JAIL SHOULD BE JAILS- AND IN THE TWO SHOULD NOT BE- CONFLATED EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DONE THAT FOR. A COUPLE THOUSAND YEARS- IN WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND SO I'M I'M VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN SEPARATING THOSE TWO- BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE GOING FORWARD. FOR YOU TO ASSUME THAT THE SENATOR. BUT DIRECTOR ZERO I GUESS I CAN START WITH HER AND- LET HER REFER TO SOMEBODY ELSE SO SHE WANTS TO. THANKYOU SENATOR CORTESE FOR- YEAH KIND OF ELEVATING THAT ISSUE- YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT- I THINK THAT THE PROGRAM BEING THE MENTAL HEALTH APPROACHES THE GENDER RESPONSIVE CULTURAL CHARLIE RESPONSIVE APPROACHES ARE CRITICAL- BUT I THINK WHAT WHAT IS ALSO HISTORICALLY BEEN TRUE IS THAT THE LOCAL JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES ARE NOT- MORE CONCEIVED AS THERAPEUTIC LOCATIONS. AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT- ARE YOU- IS THAT MANY OF THEM WILL BE SPENDING. UNFORTUNATELY YEARS- DEPENDING ON WHAT WE ULTIMATELY AFTER AS FAR AS THAT THAT COMMITMENT MATRIX BUT THERE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THE DEEPER AND HIGHER AND- PUBLIC SAFETY YOU WILL NEED TO BE IN A FACILITY FOR. AND UNDER AND- THESE DETENTION FACILITIES OR DEVELOPED. IN THAT REGARD AND BECAUSE WE'RE GOING INTO THIS LOCAL APPROACH WE WANT WE WANT FACILITIES THAT HAVE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. PLACED PLACES WE WANT ARE YOU PARENTING USE TO HAVE MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE OUR YOUTH WILL BE RE ENTERING AND RE ENTRY WILL BE PLANNED FOR FROM DAY ONE IN OUR PAST DISABILITY. AND I THINK WHAT WHAT WE CAN LOOK TOWARDS ALSO ULTIMATELY IS WHAT KIND OF STEP DOWN PROGRAMMING THERE WILL BE BECAUSE I'M THINKING THAT. THE NEED FOR THAT WHOLE OPERATION FROM SOCIETY AND- I'M HOPING THAT BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE GOOD PROGRAMMING THAT THAT WON'T BE LIKE THE- THAT- FOR EXAMPLE AS YOU KNOW IN OUR OWN COUNTY SENATOR CORTESE WE HAD. BOTH TENSION HAS BEEN AROUND VISIBILITY BUT EVEN THAT EVEN THE STEP DOWN FACILITIES ARE GOING TO NEED- MORE THEY'RE GONNA AT ARCHITECTURAL IN OUR OWN COUNTY THE WINDOWS NEED TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE OF HIGH RISK VERSUS MEDIUM REST- FENCING AND SOME OF THE COUNTIES WILL HAVE TO BE CHANGED OR UPGRADED SO I THINK IT'S BOTH. I THINK I THINK WE WANT OUR DEEPEST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO FILE TRANSFER MOTIONS FOR EVERY SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD. AND THAT CONFIDENCE IS BUILT WHEN WE HAVE MEANINGFUL PLACES FOR YOU TO BE. NOT AND NOT IN THE CASE WHILE THEY UNDERGO REALLY IMPORTANT TRAIN MISSION WORK SO I THINK IT'S BOTH AND I DIDN'T. THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT WORK TO DO IN THE- THAT WE'RE HAVE ARE USED AND THAT'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THE PROGRAMMING. THANK THANK YOU READ YOU ADD TO THE QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I DON'T THINK. I GUESS MORE SPECIFICALLY THAT I PROBABLY DIDN'T ARTICULATE WELL THE QUESTION IS ARE THERE SHOULD HOW MUCH OF IT IS LOCAL CONTROL IN TERMS OF THOSE DESIGN ELEMENTS THAT YOU WERE JUST DESCRIBING- YOU KNOW THINGS. DON'T AND HOW MUCH OF IT. IT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT WILL WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE SIGNED OFF IN TERMS OF THE GRANT APPLICATIONS. VERSUS DEFERENCE LOCAL CONTROL- IF THAT'S NOT IT IN EASY ANSWER I COULD CERTAINLY TALK OFF LINE AND JUST ONE BEING THE STATE LEVEL A BLANK CHECK TYPE OF THE GRANT HERE WE KNOW YOU'RE ALL DIFFERENT WE NOTIFIED COUNTIES HAVE BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS IN COUNTY EXECUTIVES IN ADMINISTRATION AND PROBATION AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HERE'S THE MONEY AND GO TO WHAT YOU THINK YOU SHOULD DO OR ARTISTRY. GROWTH TO THOSE WHO JUST. AND KATIE CAN YOU CAN YOU HANDLE THAT QUESTION SURE IT DIRECTLY SERRA I WILL TRY ON I FEEL LIKE WELL FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO DIRECTORS THEREFORE. I THINK THE PROCESS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A GENERAL JUDGE FOR MANY YEARS AS STRICKEN THE SERRA HAS- REALLY HELPS TO KIM'S THAT ACTION PRAGMATIC EXPERIENCE OF WHAT IS NEEDED WHEN- A YOUNG PERCENT COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE JUVENILE SYSTEM BOB SO JUST TO QUICK THOUGHTS I THINK I REALLY WANT TO- UNDERSCORE THE POINT THE DIRECTOR THE CERRO MADE ABOUT THIS FUNDING IS INTENDED TO. BETTER SUPPORT THE WHOLE CAN YOU ONE OF CARE THE COUNTIES NEED TO HAVE AVAILABLE SO SOME OF THE FINDING MAY INDEED BE GOING TO SUPPORT ON SECURE USE TREATMENT FACILITIES AND IN THAT REGARD CENTER CORTESE CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE MATE WITH AND THEY MINISTRATION MAY WISH TO PUT MORE THE CITY ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW HOW THE FUNDING CAN BE WORLD OUT SHOULD SOME BE GOING TO SECURE YOUR TREATMENT FACILITIES SOME OF THE DOLLARS GO TO THOSE AND- OTHER KINDS OF THINGS LIKE. GRANNY THESE NEXT MONTH AS WE LOOK AT THIS PURPOSE WHICH IS TIMES AND I THINK MIGHT BOTTOM LINE IS COUNTY NEED TO BE REALLY READY TO PROVIDE THAT RANGE PROGRAM AND TREATMENT- AND DOWN SIR AND ALL. YOU KNOW I I'M PART OF THE ADMIN SO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE CAN THE RIGHT BALANCE- FOUND IN TERMS OF SHORT DEGREE OF. CONTROL BUT ALSO. A CLEAR STATEMENT OF WHAT THE STATE. IS THAT THAT LIKE A GOOD LANDING PLACE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU THAT'S THANK YOU IT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR AND- BUT BE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT. THE GETTING INVOLVED IN THOSE THOSE DISCUSSIONS SOME IN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS- ARE THIS IS PART OF THE COMMITTEE BUT- INDIVIDUALLY AS WELL THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION I HAD IT IS. AGAIN PROBABLY GOING TO BE TAKEN. THAT THE SORT OF SIMILAR HIGH LEVEL- BUT THEY WERE SO MUCH REFERENCE. YOU KNOW TO YOUTH VERSUS ADULTS- THE CARD SHIN- THE COURT SYSTEM IN PENCIL FOURTH. I CAN'T HELP BUT ASK YOU KNOW WITH- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IN MOST COUNTIES HAS BEEN OF A VERY SUCCESSFUL AB ONE OH NINE ROLLOUT- REENTRY- KIND OF PROTECTIVENESS- HE IN IN WITH THIS REALIGNMENT. HERO PICKING UP STEAM THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN SOME DISCUSSION SOME PAST RECENT LEGISLATION THAT THAT ALLOWS SOME DISCRETION IN TERMS OF. H. AND IN TERMS OF WHO IS A YOUTH WHAT WHAT CONSTITUTES A YOUTH IT SHOULD BE TO YOU FACILITY A PERSON THAT SHOULD BE TO YOU FACILITY VERSUS- AN OFFENDER WHO ADULT FACILITY IN- AGAIN IS A SHORT ANSWER I'M GOING TO GUESS BASED ON THAT LAST RESPONSES THAT. IT IS TO BE DETERMINED- DID. YOU KNOW AGAIN I GET IT TODAY'S A BUDGET HEARING IT'S NOT. THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE PER SE- BUT BUT OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING POLICY AND BUDGETS VERY MUCH INTERTWINED HERE SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A FEEL FOR YOUR THOUGHTS. ON HOW FLEXIBLE. THE HE SORT OF THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE OR. TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY FIVE CATEGORY SHOULD BE IN TERMS OF THE REENTRY APPROACH AND WHO SHOULD GO INTO WHICH FACILITIES AGAIN JUST BECAUSE- THANK YOU YEAH I'M I THINK THE LAW ALLOWS AND ACTUALLY REQUIRES THAT A YOUTHFUL OFFENDER. D. N. A. U. FACILITY I THINK THAT DOES. THERE THERE IS THERE ARE SOME DISCUSSIONS AROUND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE USES TWENTY FIVE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE LAW SEEMS TO. ALLOW FOR A USED UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE TO REMAIN IN THAT YOU'VE DISABILITY. THERE IS THAT OTHER AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH AROUND SIGHT AND SOUND SEPARATION- IF THE YOUTH IS OVER THAT AGE BUT CURRENTLY- USE UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE WILL IT IS. EXPECTED AND REQUIRED THAT THEY ARE IN THE U. FACILITY AS LONG AS THAT AT CURRENT WHEN THEY WERE- UNDER EIGHTEEN- SO WE HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN- YOUTHFUL OFFENDER BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE. BUT IF HE- UNDER EIGHTEEN THERE THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL BE. HAVE THAT REHABILITATIVE EXPERIENCE IN OUR SECURE AT TRACK YOU FACILITIES. DOES THAT ANSWER THAT QUESTION SENATOR CORTESE YES YES IT DOES FOR NO I THAT THAT GETS ME REAL CLEAR ON WHAT THE BASELINE IS RIGHT NOW AND I SUPPOSE FOR FUTURE CONVERSATIONS POLICY CONVERSATIONS- WHETHER OR NOT ANYTHING MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. WHERE IS THIS MISS HOWARD HOWARD WAS KIND OF ALLUDING TO WHETHER OR NOT. AT SOME POINT THERE'S MORE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION ON- A LOT MORE TO DO IN THAT REGARD SO I'LL STOP THERE THANK YOU ALL AGAIN I'M PRODUCES EXTREMELY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR TEAM AND WITH THE HELP- IN. ORDER TO LOOK AT THINGS TO COME THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU I HAVE JUST A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS PROBABLY FOR DOCTOR BULLS- IF YOU COULD CLARIFY THE OUR POPULATION PROJECTION FOR THE NEXT YEAR. I GUESS THERE'S BEEN A DIFFERENT NUMBER SO I JUST WANNA IF YOU COULD GIVE US AS MUCH CLARITY TO THAT AS POSSIBLE. YES YES AND ACTUALLY- CHRIS CHAMBERS IS ALSO ON THE LINE AND HE CAN SPEAK TO THOSE POP PRODUCTION STUFF I SEE HAS HIS HANDS HAVE BEEN RIGHT SO I'M GOING TO TRY HM AND THAT TIME CAN ADD ANY. TIME THANK YOU MEMBERS COMMITTEE CHRIS CHAMBERS DEPUTY DIRECTOR CCAR'S OFFICE OF RESEARCH.

SO THAT LAST NUMBER IS EXPECTED BY TWENTY THREE TO BE 410093% FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THREE YES WHAT KIND OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAMBERS- THE OTHER OUR QUESTION DOCTOR BOLD IS- ON THE ISSUE THAT YOU MENTIONED HICH IS A- THE BIG CHALLENGE IS THE- STAFFING. OF AS YOU ADDRESS THAT- I'VE HEARD REPORTS CALL- BUT ADVOCATES- TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT ARE A RANGE OF ISSUES THAT IS BECAUSE BECAUSE AS I UNDERSTAND THE LACK OF OUR THE SHORTAGE OF STAFF- THE OF COURSE THE CULPRIT OUTBREAKS WHICH IF YOU COULD DEAL WITH SEPARATELY. OUR YOUTH ARE GETTING THEIR FOOD ON TIME- MAYBE STAFF WAS NOT TRAINED TO WORK WITH YOU BEING USED OSTAP ON YOUTH VIOLENCE COULD YOU. RESPOND TO THOSE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION. OF COURSE SO- AND I WILL I DO KNOW THAT THE CODE IS ON A SEPARATE AGENDA ITEM BUT YOU WANT TO SET THAT UP OBVIOUSLY THAT HAS AT. INCREASED OUR CHALLENGE AROUND SHOPPING AND SO- I THINK I'LL I'LL TACKLE THOSE ISSUES UNDER UNDER COVER THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SAY THAT THAT IS A REACHED. IT HAS INCREASED THOSE CHALLENGES FOR THAT IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION SO- WE ARE MONITORING ALL OF THOSE THINGS CLOSELY AND ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HAD STAFFING CHALLENGES FOR EXAMPLE OUR INTERVENTIONS THERE ARE CONDUCTED BY OUR YOUTH CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS THEIR SCHEDULES FOR THOSE WHERE MONITORING ANY OF THOSE GROUPS. HAVE BEEN RESCHEDULED- HIRED SOME OF THE WITH MOST RECENTLY AROUND THE COPING POSITIVE STAFF INTERVENTIONS BEING RESCHEDULED BUT THEY WERE NOT BEING MESSED- BUT IN ORDER TO REALLY IN BECAUSE AGAIN THE FOCUS ON THE- PUBLICATION. UTILIZING OUR CONTRACTORS OUR COMMUNITY PROVIDERS TO HELP SUPPLEMENT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WELL- SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE ESPECIALLY VERY IMPORTANT INTERVENTIONS THAT REDUCE WASTE- IN TERMS OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THOSE HAVE CONTINUED. AS IS OUR PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE CONTINUED TO STEP BACK AND PROVIDING. RESOURCES WE HAVE THE AVAILABILITY TO DO THAT. WE HAD EDUCATION THE NEW YORKER EVEN THROUGH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH CO IT AND IN FACT- BRAD YOU WAITED AT QUITE A FEW YOU AND- MORE SO THAN EVER I DON'T. I HAVE I TAKE ALL CONCERNS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO ME VERY SERIOUSLY AND SO I HAVE FOLLOWED UP ON ANY CONCERNS AROUND CHEATING AND- THAT WHEN WE- TURN IT DOWN. NOT SEE ANY SIX ISSUES AROUND THAT WE ARE PREPARED- SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE AND STAFFING WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES CAN USE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE ADOLESCENT USE SO- NOT ONLY IS THAT IMPORTANT FOR JUST THAT THE DAY TO DAY FUNCTIONING BUT- AT YOU KNOW IT. BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST IMPORTANT PART OF MAKING SURE WE CAN- PROVIDE THE HEALTH IN TERMS OF- CONCERNS AROUND VIOLENCE- WE HAVE SEEN DECREASES OVER THIS LAST YEAR BUT AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING. WE MONITOR. I GOING BACK TO KIND OF SOME OF MY EARLY CALL IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH CALL OF YEAR FOR I THINK EVERYONE IN TERMS WE HAD TO CHANGE THINGS- BECAUSE OF CODE THAT MAKES IT JEFF FOR YEARS- THEY'RE FRUSTRATED WITH SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IN PLACE FOR HEALTH HEALTH AND SAFETY- THAT ALWAYS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE AROUND AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE- USING OUR RESOURCES ARE MENTAL HEALTH STAFF TO HELP ADDRESS THOSE. IF SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ARE BROUGHT TO ME AGAIN ABOUT SPECIFIC INCIDENTS WE ARE FOLLOWING UP WE HAVE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. REVEALING INCIDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THEY ARE OUTSIDE OF ALL THIS YEAR THERE IS A CONCERN WHICH AT ANY PARTICULAR INCIDENT THAT IT IS REVIEWED AND FOLLOWED UP ON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

PROGRAMMING IN AND DOC CREDIT EARNING OPPORTUNITIES- AND- IF THE ARE THE GROUPS CURRENTLY OPERATING IF NOT ARE THEY READY TO RESUME OPERATIONS. CURRENTLY FOR A DANCE FLOOR AND WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL ROAD MAP TO REOPEN AN EFFORT FACED ONE- UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE TO ACT SOCIAL- INTERACTION- AS WE REOPEN DUE TO THE NUMBER OF KOBE CASES DECREASED THEME WE DO START THAT INTERACTION WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING. I AM IN BOTH PARENTS AN INMATE ACTIVITY GROUPS AS WELL AS THE NURSING LIKE. SO CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO ALTERNATE I MEAN. YOU SAY NAP UNTIL AFTER THE- AT WHAT POINT DO YOU START OF THE PROGRAMMING OR HOW DO YOU MAKE UP FOR IT. WHEN IT'S NOT WHEN THE PROGRAM STOPPED. RIGHT NOW WE'RE EXPLORING- WHAT WE CALL A PILOT FOR RANCH FOR THAT AND WAIT THEY DON'T REAL BAD. CREDIT YEAH- AND THAT'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AT INCEL PROGRAMMING TO EARN THESE CREDITS WE OF COURSE PREFERRED TO DO THINGS- SOCIALLY INTERACTIVELY BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY SEE THE INMATES INTERACT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN YOU IGHT SEE THEM- WHEN THEY'RE DOING AND SELF STUDY SO WE WOULD REALLY. WE REALLY HOPE TO CONTINUE WITH THE SOCIAL FACTOR OF IT. BUT WE UNDERSTAND WITH TIMES LIKE THIS THAT WE CAN OFFER AS MUCH AS WE CAN- AND SENSELESS WELL. SO THEY CAN. TO EARN THESE CRY.

IN A REGULAR CLASSROOM I THINK. THAT OKAY I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR ELDRIDGE AND OTHERS FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. FIVE OKAY ISSUE SEVEN IS THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE EXPANSION CDCR PLEASE. I HELLO PARDON MY PARDON MY TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGE THERE. I AM SHANNON SWAIN SUPERINTENDENT OF THE OFFICE OF CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND I'M HERE TO EXPLAIN BUT THERE IS A RULE REHABILITATIVE REVOLUTION UNDERWAY IN CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS. IN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS BILL THIRTEEN NINETY ONE WHICH ALLOWED CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY TO TEACH CLASSES INSIDE CDCR INSTITUTIONS. HIGHER EDUCATION HAS GROWN ENORMOUSLY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LOS ANGELES BECAME THE FIRST CSU OFFERING A BA INSIDE CDCR SINCE THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE PILOTED **** AGREE PATHWAYS IN FOR ADDITIONAL INSTITUTIONS. I AM HERE TO EXPLAIN TO EXPLAIN THAT CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION IS TRANSFORMATIVE. THE OFFICE OF CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION SIX EXTENT THE INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA IS MAKING THROUGH ITS WORLD CLASS HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM YOU INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS I FUNDING BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE PROGRAMS IN SEVEN CDC OUR INSTITUTIONS. WE ARE REQUESTING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE GENERAL FUND DECREASING TO FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND FIFTY POSITIONS TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND THE NUMBER OF PRISONS OFFERING BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAMS IN PARTNERHIP WITH SEVERAL. DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. THE RESOURCES WOULD BE USED TO MAINTAIN PROGRAMS THAT FOR PRESENTS WHOSE EXISTING FUNDING IS EXPIRING AND CREATE NEW PROGRAMS AT THREE ADDITIONAL PRESENCE FUNDING THOSE POSITIONS TO PARTNER WITH CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IS. ULTIMATELY THE GOAL WOULD BE TO HAVE SEVEN HOBBY INSTITUTIONS OFFERING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE ENSURING EQUITY FOR EVERY SECURITY LEVEL AND ALL GENDERS. ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WHO HAVE EARNED A FULLY TRANSFERABLE ASSOCIATE OF ARTS DEGREE IN ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS. ARE THEN ABLE TO APPLY TO ONE OF THE C. ISSUES CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY STATUS PART AND PARTNERING WITH CDCR. AND COMPLETE THE FINAL TWO YEARS OF UPPER DIVISION COURSES. WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF AS THEIR JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEARS. RESEARCH SUPPORTS HIGHER EDUCATION AS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AT RISK REDUCING RECIDIVISM. AND THIS THAT THE FUNDING OF THE SEVEN BE A PROGRAMS WOULD BE A LONG TERM INVESTING. FUTURE ALL OF THE OFFICE OF CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION IS TO PROVIDE A TRUE EDUCATION CONTINUUM. BUT THAT WE CAN MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE WHEN THEY ENTER THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM. ASSESS THEIR SKILLS ABILITIES AND DESIRES AND THEN ASSIST THEM TO COMPLETE THEIR GOALS WITHOUT A CERTIFICATION IN A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM. OR A COLLEGE DEGREE. THE MULTI GENERATIONAL IMPACT. BUT THAT IT COLLEGE HAS ON THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY ENTHUSIASM FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IMPRISONMENT AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWERING. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR ENTHUSIASM. IT BRINGS VERY GOOD PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU I'M SORRY IS IT SWAY DID YOU SAY YOUR LAST NAME PLANA WITHIN AND SLAIN WAYNE OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- THIS IS OPPORTUNITY FOR FINANCE PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND SOME PRETTY MEMBERS ANY FRIENDS OR WITH PARTNER FINANCE- NOTHING SPECIFIC TO ADD AT THIS POINT IN TIME IN ADDITION TO WHAT JAMES SAID I WOULD JUST NOTE THE- CCR IN FINANCE AND WORKING TO PROVIDE RESPONSIVE INFORMATION OF THE ALLEY I WAS QUESTIONS. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH BOTH- THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE L. A. OUR TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL. JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU- FROM FROM LA PLEASE. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- SENATORS AT THE AT THIS POINT WE'RE CONTINUING TO ANALYZE THIS PROPOSAL I WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND ADMINISTRATION TO RECEIVE FURTHER INFORMATION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WE BROUGHT UP IN THE AGENDA HAVE BEEN SINCE ANSWERED. AND THE ADMINISTRATION COULD SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE WHY WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSED EXPANSION IS PROMISING GIVEN THAT RESEARCH SUGGESTS. YEAH HIGHER EDUCATION AS POSITIVE OUTCOMES THERE IS A CONCERN WE WANNA REYES TO THE LEGISLATURE AT THIS POINT. SPECIFICALLY IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY THE DEPARTMENT'S FULL REQUESTED AMOUNT IS NECESSARY SOME OF THE PROGRAMS WERE ESTABLISHED AND OPERATED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S EXISTING BUDGET. HELLO LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROZEN USE FROM MADAM CHAIR- SORT OF BORED WITH THE- LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE I THINK MY COLLEAGUES VIDEO IS FROZEN I CAN COMPLETE HIS COMMENTS BOB ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE ARE STILL WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER IS WHY ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NEEDED FOR THE EXSTING PROGRAMS GIVING THAT GIVEN THAT THEY WERE SUPPORTED WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES. BY THE DEPARTMENT PREVIOUSLY- AND THIS INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THE FULL AMOUNT OF REQUESTED IS NECESSARY OR IMAGE CDCR CAN CONTINUE TO USE SOME OF ITS EXISTING FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS- AS MY- COLLEAGUE INDICATED- WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO GETHIS INFORMATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OTHER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR FILLING TO- SENATE QUARTERS HE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES IT IS A FOLLOW UP THE TO THE OLEO. WHAT THE CONCERNS OF ANY IDEA HAVE ABOUT SUNSET- SUNSETTING OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS IS SAID HOW DOES A PLAY TO JUST GET A LITTLE IN MY MIND HERE ABOUT- MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS RELATIVE TO ANY NEED FOR LEGISLATION TO EXTEND THE PILOTS IF THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO DO. TO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE REASON THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS BEING REQUESTED IS BECAUSE B. THE FUNDING FOR THE EXISTING PROGRAMS IS EXPIRING HOWEVER IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WHY THAT'S THE CASE OR WHY THE- FUNDING CAN'T BE EXTENDED FOR EXAMPLE. THE DEPARTMENT HAS INDICATED THAT A PORTION OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS SUPPORTING THESE PROGRAMS RELATED TO BANKING POSITIONS AND IT'S UNCLEAR TO US AT THIS POINT WHAT THOSE MAKING POSITIONS ARE OR WHY IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE BERKELEY- DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE USING THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE POSITIONS. TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS. YEAH I GIVE THEM I GUESS SOME PART I'M ASKING IS IF. WE GOT PROGRAM EXPIRATION DATES COMING FORWARD- IT IN IN MAYBE I'M READING THE REPORT WRONG- SO MAYBE MEASURE WE COULD ASSESS A QUESTION OF- THE OF THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE ELOISE COMMENTS AND TO WHAT EXTENT. ARE WE FACING EXPIRATION DATES ON THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES. YES SORRY THIS IS ALL JUMP IN VERSUS BATTLE IN THE CLEAN- AND I CAN. IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NEEDED. TO BE CLEAR WE DID A START THIS PILOT PROJECT ON A VERY SMALL SENATE POPULATION IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT LESS THAN FORTY. WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS FULLY UP AND RUNNING IT WILL SERVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY. PARTICIPANTS AND SO IF THE- SAVINGS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY ANALYZING WAS AVAILABLE ON A ONE TIME SPACES TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM. I'M SO WE IT'S NOT AN ONGOING SOLUTION- FOR IT'S NOT. OPERATE YOU POSSIBLY TRY TO FIND ONE TIME SAVINGS TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM ONGOING SPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW CRITICAL IT IS AND WE HAVE THE AVAILABLE THANK YOU SO HOW GRANT FUNDING TO OFFSET SOME OF THIS AS WELL SO I. ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S NOT ALL GENERAL FUND THERE IS A PORTION THAT WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE- FEDERAL FUNDS FOR AS WELL. OKAY ABSOLUTE AMOUNT I'M NOT SURE THAT. CLEARS UP THE OLD L. L. A. O.'S QUESTION AND IN MY MIND I MEAN WHEN YES I DID NO AND HAVE IN MY NOTES THE PROGRAM FUNDING- BUT THAT ALMOST GOES. IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR CONCERN IF YOU'RE A PELL GRANT FUNDING IN EXISTING. FUNDING I KNOW YOU SAID IT WAS ONE TIME- THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IF I ME JUST FOLLOW UP IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT YES WE'VE HAD EXISTING FUNDING- CAPACITY AVAILABLE BUT IT'S BEEN ONE TIME AND WE'RE TRYING TO CONVERT THAT TO ON GOING TO KEEP UP WITH THE GROWTH OF THE PROGRAM. THAT'S CORRECT SO WE HAVE. SALARY SAVINGS IS ONLY ONE TIME IN NATURE IT'S AS A RESULT OF A VACANT POSITIONS THAT DEPARTMENT HAS THE ONE POINT TIMES IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE- CANNOT I'M GOING. AT THIS POINT WE DETERMINED THAT THIS. PROJECT WAS VERY IMPORTANT WE HAD SOMEAVAILABLE RESOURCES TO START UP AGAIN ON A VERY SMALL LIMIT. THAT SERVES LESS THAN FORTY EIGHT OFFENDERS AS OF THIS PROPOSAL. TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE FEDERAL FUNDS. OFFSET AND EXPANDS IT TO SEVEN MORE INSTITUTIONS TOGETHER TO GET UP TO A COURT COURT OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY- OFFENDERS THAT CAN JUST BE IN THIS PROGRAM ANNUALLY. AGAIN IT'S- THE SAVINGS WAS THERE ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO DO THE PILOT PROGRAMS. ACTIVE NESTS AND TO EVALUATE IT AND THEN THIS PROPOSAL BRINGS FORWARD- I'M MORE CONSOLIDATED APPROACH- THAT COVERS. IT CAN COVER MORE OFFENDERS. GET THE IF I AGAIN THROUGH THE SURE WOULD I'D REQUEST MET CHAIR IS. SOME KIND OF OUT OF SPREADSHEET IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE NEED TO BE VERY COMPLEX ARE VERY MANY CALLS ON IT THAT SHOW- THE POSITION. THESE THESE POSITION DOLLARS- THE POSITIONS THAT ARE ELIMINATED OR THE UNF ARE THE POSITIONS THAT ARE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED OR JUST VACANT FUNDED POSITIONS WHICH I THINK WOULD BE OF CONCERN TO THE LA- BECAUSE HAVE HAD BIG FUNDED POSITIONS- SURE YOU HAVE ONE TIME SAVINGS RIGHT NOW BUT ALSO RAISES A QUESTION ABOUT WHY YOU WOULDN'T ROLL THOSE VACANT FUNDED POSITIONS FORWARD TO- TO FILL SOME OF THE NEED HERE THE STAR FOR DOLLAR- BUT IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US. IS SOCIALLY WITH THE ALEJO'S ASKING FOR AND I THINK. BUT BUT WE'RE ASKING FOR AT THE COMMITTEE HERE JUST IN A SUPPLEMENTARY. STACK SUPPLE A SUPPLEMENTAL SPREADSHEET- YOU KNOW SOMETIME SOON AFTER THIS COMMITTEE MEETING I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL ON ON NOT SPEAK VERY SPECIFIC TOPIC OF. OF ONE TIME POSITIONS VERSES ONGOING POSITIONS OF PURSES YOU KNOW THE BUDGET MADE HERE. BUT I'M NOT I'M NOT CHALLENGING ON THE THEY JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. THANK YOU. UNDERSTOOD AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE L. A. O. ON AND THIS IS. POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE THEIR PERMANENT POSITIONS ARE BIG WHEN THEY'RE BIG AND THEY'RE ONLY BAKE AT ONE TIME YEAH I JUST CERTAIN POINT IN TIME WE ONLY CAPTURE THAT SAVINGS- FOR THAT ONE SMALL PERIOD OF TIME THAT THEY ARE VACANT. AND SO TO THE EXTENT WE ARE WE HAD A SUPPOSITIONS BACON TO UTILIZE THAT'S WHAT WE DID BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP THOSE POSITIONS BAKER I'M GOING ARTS CENTER MY- OPERATION. I. UNDERSTAND THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING THANK YOU. THE THING THAT- I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ADD ON TO THAT IS THAT- THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS DISCRETION COULD TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE MAKING POSITIONS WARRANTY EXTENT THOSE POSITIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE. DOESN'T PRIORITIZE ANYMORE IT COULD DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO PERMANENTLY REDIRECT THAT FUNDING FOR SUPPORTED THIS PROGRAM. YEAH THAT WAS PART OF MY QUESTION EXACTLY THANK YOU ANYWAY IF WE COULD JUST GET THE SPREADSHEET ON THAT ARE. YOU KNOW SORT OF THE NUANCES THERE ARE- ON A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. UP MISTER KLEIN IS THAT REQUEST. FONG CLEAR. YES YEAH THANK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON THE- ON THE PROGRAM ITSELF- OF WHAT WAS THEIR INVOLVEMENT OF THE C. ISSUES AND- PUTTING THESE PROGRAMS TOGETHER BEACON. JUST TAKE A MINUTE TO TALK ABOUT THAT WHAT HAPPENS AS FREQUENTLY WE HEAR FROM FACULTY FROM DIFFERENT COLLEGES THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST YEAR OR TWO IS THAT IT REALLY REQUIRES A COMMITMENT FROM THE VERY TOP LEVEL OF THE UNIVERSITY- SO. WE WORKED WITH SAC STATE TO GET A VERY SMALL PROGRAM UP AT FOLSOM STATE PRISON AND MULE CREEK STATE PRISON- AND WE UTILIZED- TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC- WE ALSO BROUGHT UP. A SORT OF. INTRO PROGRAM IF YOU WELL AT VALLEY STATE PRISON AND AT C. C. W. F. THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY. WITH ALL STATE FRESNO AND FOR THAT PROGRAM THAT WHOLE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE- FORMAL CURRICULAR PARENTS AND WORKING WITH THE ACADEMICS BENNETT IS ALL BEING TAKEN CARE OF. BY FRESNO STATE. AND THEN OF COURSE OUR PROGRAM AT LEC. SERVE OUR GRANDDADDY OF OUR BA PROGRAMS THAT REALLY GOT OFF THE GROUND INITIALLY UTILIZING SECOND CHANCE PELL DOLLARS AGAIN AS AN EXPERIMENT. AND NOW WE HAVE SEEN THE SUCCESS WE HAD A MANY MEN GRADUATE LAST YEAR INCLUDING CINEMA FORMER LIFE FOR INMATES WHO WERE ABLE TO RELEASED AND GRADUATE ON CAMPUS AT CAL STATE LA. SO WE ARE SEEKING TO EXTEND FOR SIX OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO OTHER INST ANCE. MIGHT IS THAT WE WILL HAVE. A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND EVERY SECURITY LEVEL IN EVERY GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND THE STATE. AND IN BOTH GENDERS. GREAT THANK YOU AND THEN JUST ONE MORE QUESTION ON THAT- WELL HOW DO YOU SUPPORT- THE INMATES- YOU KNOW AS THE YOU KNOW THERE IF THEY SAY THEY'RE ELIGIBLE HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN AND COMPLETING THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE. WELL I'M WE DEDICATE NOT ONLY IS A- AT THE UNIVERSITY FACULTY WHICH PROVIDES THE SAME LEVEL OF COUNSELING SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE WITH PLANNING WHERE I. DEGREE PATHWAY ETCETERA. AND THE INSIDE OF THE INSTITUTIONS ARE WE'VE BEEN UTILIZING STAFF FROM- FROM. FROM FROM R. A. B. E. PROGRAMS ADULT BASIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS I BECAUSE WE WERE IN A PANDEMIC AND THEY WERE NOT INSTRUCTING ONE ON ONE WE UTILIZE THEIR SERVICE ASSIST TO ASSIST US IN PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND WHAT THEY DO IS AND THE REASON THAT WE NEED STAFF TO RUN THIS PROGRAM. IS THAT THEY NEED TO ATTEND A COMMITTEE MEETINGS. THE PROSECUTION COMMITTEE MEETINGS THEY NEED TO COORDINATE WITH UNIVERSITY FACULTY ON SETTING UP THE SCHEDULE ON ARRANGING SPACE HONEST THE STING TO BRING UP THAT TECHNOLOGY A WHEN NEEDED- UNTIL WE CAN GET BACK TO FACE TO FACE WHICH IS HOPEFULLY SOON- AND THEN THEY ALSO ASSIST WITH ALL OF THE- KEEPING FUNCTION. CDCR REQUIRES IN OUR US STRATEGIC OFFENDER MANAGEMENT DATABASE MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF THAT GETS- PUT INTO THE DATABASE AND COMMUNICATE REGULARLY WITH FACULTY I HADN'T SAID THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK INVOLVED- AT THE STATE LEVEL. MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS OCCUR IN THE EVENING I BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SPACE. CONSIDERATIONS AND DURING THE DAY. A CLASS. WITH ADULTS IS. THE CHEAPER IN HIGH SCHOOL AND ALL OF THE OTHER. AMAZING AT OPPORTUNITIES EXPATS SO WE BEEN DURING THIRD WATCH. AND SO THERE'S ALSO- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO CONSIDER THINGS LIKE CUSTODY ESCORT AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN GET. IT GOES FROM ONE YARD TO THE OTHER WHERE WHERE THE CLASSES MAY ACTUALLY BE CONDUCTED. HOPE THAT HELPS THAT'S YOUR QUESTION YEAH GREAT. THANK YOU- MISS WHEN PRECIADO YOUR ENTHUSIASM. AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO PRESENTED I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I A FEW YEARS AGO I DID VISIT- OF FACILITY AND WAS GOING TO CLASSROOM AFTER CLASSROOM. AND AS IT DOES THE GENTLEMEN WERE STANDING UP TO TALK ABOUT WHY THEY- LOVE YOU KNOW TAKING THESE CLASSES I NOTICED THAT THERE WERE MANY OF THEM WHO HAD. TWO OR THREE OR FOUR EIGHT EIGHTIES. BUT MULTIPLE CALLS ARE LIKE OKAY LET ME DO IT HERE AND THEY COULDN'T GET FURTHER. IN THEIR SPECIALTY IN THERE AND THE AREA THAT THEY REALLY WANTED TO BECAUSE THEY WERE STUCK. SO YEAH THIS IS A HUGE REGION ARE I'M SORRY REASON I'M REALLY PURSUING THIS WE WANT OUR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO START. ON THE DAY THEY COME INTO THE TO THE PRESENT I'M I'M BE ASSESSED AND THEN WE TAKE THEM AS FAR AS THEY WANT TO GO IN TERMS OF EDUCATION. SO FIRST WORKING ON THAT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THEN INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEN SHE STATE FARM ESPECIALLY IN THOSE CORRESPONDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS IT ONLY TAKES THREE ADDITIONAL CLASSES SOMETIMES. ON AN ADDITIONAL. EIGHT FORTUNATELY THOSEIT AGREES OR NOT- ALWAYS TRANSFER TO CALIFORNIA STATE% UNIVERSITY WHICH IS WHY WE'VE INVESTED SO MUCH TIME. ENERGY AND RESOURCES INTO MAKING SURE THAT OUR ASSOCIATE OF ARTS DEGREE PROGRAMS NOW MEET WHAT ARE CALLED THE GOLDEN FOR- WITH THAT REPAIR STUDENTS TO BE. BE A STUDENTS AT AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISS LANE- WE MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE EIGHT WHICH IS THE CELLULAR INTERDICTION PROGRAM AND A WILL HAVE CDC ARE PRESENT. MORNING SENATORS I'M CAMMIE IRWIN I TEAM MANAGER TO AT CDC OUR- ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SERVICES POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE STATEWIDE EXPANSION AND UPGRADE OF THE MANAGED ACCESS SYSTEMS MANAGE ACCESS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S CONTRABAND CELLULAR PHONE INTERDICTION STRATEGY AND IS DESIGNED TO DISRUPT CONTRABAND CELLPHONE COMMUNICATIONS AND ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO INTERFERE WITH AND DISMANTLE CONTRABAND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. CONTRABAND DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE SAFETY OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION STAFF AND THE PUBLIC THE PRESENCE OF CONTRABAND ALSO HAS MANY NEGATIVE OUTCOMES INCLUDING VICTIMIZATION ITS CITIZENS AUSTERITIES WITHIN THE INCARCERATED POPULATION. RISK OF OVERDOSE AND THE INTERFERENCE WITH AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION. CONTRABAND CELLPHONES DELIVER A LINK BETWEEN INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND OUTSIDE ACTORS ENABLING THE CONTINUOUS OPERATION OF CONTRABAND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. I WAS AS BIG UPGRADE OF THE MANAGED ACCESS SYSTEMS AT THE EIGHTEEN INSTITUTIONS WHERE IT CURRENTLY EXISTS AND EXPANSION OF THE INVOLVED TECHNOLOGY TO THE REMAINING INSTITUTION. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU IS THERE A WIN ON FINANCE PLEASE. LAST NAME IN THE PARTMINER FINANCE WE JUST WANTED TO AGAIN EMPHASIZE AND STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF THIS PROPOSAL AND NOTE THAT- IT IS A THREE YEAR ROLLOUT FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND INSTALLATION SO THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY AS FAR AS WHICH INSTITUTIONS. HE PROPOSAL HITS AT WHICH TIME AND THAT'S IN MEDIATION TO THE L. A. AS CONCERNS ABOUT INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE CLOTHES IN THE FUTURE OKAY. I'M SORRY WITH THAT LAST REMARK YOU SAID- STRATUM AND WHAT WAS IT ABOUT. THE CONNECTION WITH THE- BOB THE FUTURE CLOSURES. A. L. A. O. HAD NOTED SOME CONCERNED WITH MAKING THIS INVESTMENT AND PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR INSTALLATION AND EQUIPMENT OF THE SYSTEM AT INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE CLOTHES IN THE FUTURE AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT INCLUDES INSTALLATION OVER THREE YEARS SO THE BUDGETING IS FLEXIBLE IN ALLOWING FOR YOU KNOW FUTURE DECISIONS ABOUT FACILITIES TO BE MADE. BUT THIS WILL BE PART OF. THAT PLAN THE INTERNET NOW WITH THE PLAN IS TO AND COULD BE INSTALLATION AT THIRTY THREE INSTITUTIONS. TO DO THIS YES. BUT THAT DOES THAT INCLUDES THE POSSIBILITY OF. WHAT IS THE ISSUE OF POTENTIAL CLOSERS COMMAND AS FAR AS THOSE THIRTY THREE INSTITUTIONS. MY POINT SORRY SENATOR WITH BET WE ARE MAKING THE COMMITMENT ALL AT ONCE IN A SINGLE YEAR SO IN THE FUTURE YEARS AS WE'RE ROLLING OUT IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROPOSAL AND THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY AS FAR AS THE BUDGETING IS CONCERNED CREDIT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. OKAY OUT PLEASE. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE NEXT PROPOSAL ON YOUR AGENDA ISSUE NINE WHICH IS THE STATEWIDE CORRECTIONAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CONTINUATION PROPOSAL AND THAT'S BECAUSE BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS INVOLVES MODIFYING INFRASTRUCTURE AT SEVERAL PRISONS AND- THE ADMINISTRATION IS EXPECTED TO RELEASE VERY SOON A REPORT IDENTIFYING- AND PRIORITIZING THE CAPITAL OUTLAY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IT EXPECTS TO NEED OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS- ACROSS THE PRISON SYSTEM AND SO WE THINK THAT WHEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS THIS INFORMATION IT WOULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO. ASSESS THESE PROPOSALS AS WELL AS WELL AS OTHER PROPOSALS THAT INVOLVE MODIFICATION TO PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE- AND THEN JUST TO ADDRESS MYSTERY ALMONDS COMMENT- WELL IT'S TRUE THAT THIS FOR WOULD INVOLVE MODIFICATION OF. THE THIRTY THREE CURRENTLY OPERATED BY STATE OWNED PRESENTS OVER THE NET OVER A FEW YEARS- THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO. SIMPLY APPROVE ONE YEAR OF FUNDING IF IT'S- YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE. AT APPROVING FUNDING AT ALL PRISONS GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF CLOSURE AND. IF YOU CAN'T INFRASTRUCTURE MODIFICATIONS REPAIR YOU KNOW LARGER OVERHAULS OF CERTAIN FACILITIES ETCETERA. THANK YOU IS AN ILL- CONGRESS CENTER COURTESY ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MY ONLY COMMENT IS- YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE L. A. O. WITH REGARD TO. ADDRESSING PERSPECTIVE FACILITY CLOSURES OR YOU KNOW. REDUNDANCY WITH IS WHAT I'M HEARING POTENTIALLY WITH- THE UPCOMING DEFERRED MADE ITS BUDGET SO AT I THINK WE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THAT- NO DOUBT IN IN I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A- IF IT'S ABOVE. METHODOLOGY THAT SERVER USING IN TERMS OF BUDGETING- YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY TO SET UP A TIERED- A DECISION MAKING ESSENTIALLY AND WITHIN THE BUDGET ITSELF SO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU WANT TO APPROVE THIS AND GO FORWARD WITH IT BOB BUT WITH THE STIPULATION THAT- THAT THE DOLLARS BE TURNED BACK OVER TO DEFERRED. MAINTENANCE IF INDEED GENERAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR- FOR CDC ARE. IF INDEED A PARTICULAR FACILITY IS SHUT DOWN SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP REVISITING THAT DECISION YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE ONE YEAR INTO THIS AND THEY SAY OH WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEED THESE DOLLARS ANYMORE- ON VIDEO SURVEILLANCE FOR THIS PARTICULAR FACILITY WHY NOT JUST HAVE THEM. GIVE THEM THE DISCRETION IN ADVANCE TO IMMEDIATELY SHIFT THOSE OVER. THE SIMPLY CO MINGLE THOSE DOLLARS WITH GENERAL MAINTENANCE STORE SOLD ACT. THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE I JUST DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVER DONE BUT- WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF STIPULATIONS. ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR. ALLOWING ME TO COMMENT. WELL AS I RECALL LAST YEAR WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION HERE. ABOUT THE- ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS OR LACK OF PLANS OR LACK OF SHARING THOSE PLANS AND IT WAS ALL AROUND OUR- ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT FUNDING THEN. OF RENOVATIONS AND OTHER YOU KNOW BIG- CAPITAL OUTLAY SO WE HAD THAT DISCUSSION. WE YOU KNOW ESTABLISH THE NEED TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE GOTTEN THAT INFORMATION IN A VERY STRUCTURED. PLANNED WAY I DON'T KNOW IF FINANCED WANTS TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT- IT IS IMPORTANT TO US AS THE LEGISLATURE. TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THOSE DECISIONS NOW AND I APPRECIATE. THAT THE COMMENT WAS MADE ABOUT HAVING FLEXIBILITY BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING FLEXIBILITY WHEN YOU'RE- FACED WITH IT AND HAVING TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS SO- I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU US SECRETARY Z. ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT- AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP ON INSISTING HAVING THAT INFORMATION IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE A DECISIONS AND JUST. ALONG THOSE LINES THERE IS- THIS REPORT- ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL OUTLAYS THAT WAS EXPECTED IN JANUARY- WHEN. DO WE EXPECT TO GET THAT REPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST NAMED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN I WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONCERNING AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON RELEASING THE MASTER PLAN ANNUAL REPORT.

OUR GOALS ARE IN THIS PROPOSED.

THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE LONG HISTORY OF THOSE CASES ON THE ORDERS THAT WERE CURRENTLY UNDER- ASWELL AS THE OPERATIONAL NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN GOALS AND SO TO COMBINE ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE TO WORK WITH EXECUTIVE STAFF ON TRYING TO IDENTIFY THOSE THINGS IT'S ALSO ON THE IN HOUSE COUNSEL FUNCTION- SOMETIMES ARE INVOLVING ALSO ARE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.
