ITEMS NUMBER TWO AND ITEM NUMBER THREE WE ALSO HAVE. ITEM NUMBER FIVE IS BEING HELD A FOR A FUTURE HEARING AND SO -- WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE? SINCE -- WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM. SO WHAT AND DO HIS ACTUALLY SENATOR RAZA IN YOUR HERE. SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND HAVE YOU COME UP. AND PRESENTE ITEM NUMBER ONE SB -- TWENTY NINE AND THANK YOU AND WELCOME. RELATIONS FOR CARE. I GUESS IS YOUR FIRST COMMITTEE PRESENTATION S. FIRST COMMITTEE PRESENTATION IN. THE UPPER PART OF FIRST BILL FOR OUR HEARING THANK YOU. I'M GLAD OR SORRY WE'RE OFF -- TO OF UP TO A REALLY GOOD BILL THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THIS AN ENORMOUS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY -- THE FEDERAL. LAW FEDERAL CARE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT LED TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE GETTING ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE. SAYS THE FOLLOWING IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT A CITIZEN OR AN ALIEN LAWFULLY PRESENT THE INDIVIDUAL SHALL NOT BE TREATED AS A QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL. AND MAY NOT BE COVERED UNDER QUALIFIED HEALTH PLAN. IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET THAT IS OFFERED THROUGH THE EXCHANGE IN OTHER WORDS FEDERAL LAW EXPLICITLY AN UNJUSTLY EXCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM RECEIVING HEALTH CARE THROUGH MEDICAL. AND FROM SELECTING THE HEALTH PLAN OR PARTICIPATING IN COVERED CALIFORNIA. I DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO BUY HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN THE EXCHANGE THIS INCLUDES INDIVIDUALS LIKE DACA RECIPIENTS AND THE TPS RECIPIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR DECADES. SO AS A RESULT. ON ONE AND A HALF OVER A MILLION ON DOCTOR ADULTS ARE STILL LEFT WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. THEY CAN'T EVEN GET PREVENTATIVE CARE FOR ASTHMA OR RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS OR DIABETES THEY RELY ON EMERGENCY ROOMS THEY RELY ON LAST MINUTE CARE. THAT IS NO WAY TO TREAT PEOPLE THE MAJORITY OF WOM HAVE WORKED FOR DECADES RAISED FAMILIES AND PARENTS. PAID THEIR SHARE IN TAXES ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS HAVE LIVED IN THE U. S. FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. SO UNDOCUMENTED PARENT OR GRANDPARENT CAN TAKE THEIR CHILD OR GRANDCHILD TO SEE A DOCTOR WHEN THEY ARE SICK BUT THE PARENT OR GRANDPARENT CANNOT DO THE SAME FOR THEMSELVES. WE VIOLATE THE COMMON GOOD TO LEAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT TREATMENT FOR PREVENTABLE AILMENT SO SB TWENTY NINE WILL REMOVE THE AGE LIMIT FOR MEDI AL ELIGIBILITY. DUE TO IMMIGRATION STATUS AND TO PROVIDE MEDI CAL BENEFITS TO LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WHOSE INCOMES ARE AT OR BELOW 110038% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. NEARLY HALF OF UNDOCUMENTED IT SIS CHILDREN MOST OF TEM -- ARE CITIZENS OR LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENCE THIS REALITY HAS TREMENDOUS HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON FAMILIES AND OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANTS ARE 34% OF THE WORK FORCE TWICE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. ONLY 121% OF NON CITIZENS HAVE EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE SO THEY WORK BUT IT'S NOT PROVIDED BY AN EMPLOYER COMPARED. 268% OF CITIZENS WHOSE EMPLOYER PROVIDES THE HEALTH CARE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR TAKING A STEP. TO EXPAND MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL SHARE THE SAME DESIRE TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN REACH UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND AS WE TWENTY NINE IS A BIG STEP TOWARDS OUR GOAL. HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WORKS BETTER AND IS MORE EFFICIENT WHEN ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. CALIFORNIA MUST CONTINUE TO CHAMPION SMART POLICIES THE SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY IS B. TWENTY NINE BILLS ON OUR PROGRESS TOWARD COME. COME COVERING THE REMAINING UNINSURED AND IS THE BUILDING BLOCK TO BREEZE TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. WE ARE ALREADY PAYING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO RESORT TO EMERGENCY ROOM CARE THERE WILL BE COST SAVINGS FROM ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ACCESS PREVENTATIVE CARE. I KNOW THAT ALL OF US HAVE OUR OWN PERSONAL STORIES I'LL BE THE NOT HAVING HAD ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE OR WE KNOW OF SOMEONE THAT IS UNINSURED WITHOUT ACCESS. AS A MIGRANT FARM WORKER MYSELF WELL WE WORKED HARD TO PUT FOOD ON OTHER PEOPLE'S TABLES. WE DID NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND AS A AN INFANT BROTHER IN MY FAMILY WHO BECAME ILL. LET'S KEEP OUR GOAL OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH US UNDER RAZA WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE ASK THAT FOR THE TESTIMONY IF WE CAN -- TRY TO KEEP IT THEN SIX MINUTES SO HOW MANY WITNESSES ARE THERE. THREE OKAY SO TWO MINUTES A PIECE -- THE WELCOME AND PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THE INTERIOR TESTIMONY THANK YOU. HI AM. HI MY NAME IS LILLIAN SERRANO AND I LIVE IN THE CITY OF ESCONDIDO AND SAMUEL COUNTY -- MY HUSBAND WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE IT. HE ASKED ME TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU. A VERY IMPORTANT STORY FOR HIM THE STORY OF HIS MOTHER. SONYA HANOVER ABOUT I'M PHYLLIS MY MOTHER IN LAW. LAST SEPTEMBER MY FAMILY AND I SUFFER THE LOSS OF MY MOTHER IN LAW AFTER MONTHS OF TRYING EVERYTHING AVAILABLE TO US TO GET HER MEDICAL. MEDICAL CARE. MY MOTHER IN LAW WAS UNDOCUMENTED AN UNINSURED AS MANY IN OUR STATE. THE NEW HANOVER Là ARRIVE IN A SCHOOL IN THE THE OVER TWENTY YEARS SEVERAL. CIPOLLA LIFE THERE WITH EIGHT KIDS INCLUDING MY HUSBAND WAS ABOUT TO GRADUATE WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM COST THE SAN MARCOS. IN A WAY WHAT TOOK CARE OF HER KIDS HER GRANDCHILDREN AND EVEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS. SHE WAS A COMMUNITY LEADER WHO WOULD ALWAYS STRUCK TO DEMONSTRATIONS AND LOCAL HEARINGS. OVER A YEAR AGO SHE STARTED SUFFERING FROM A STRONG ABDOMINAL PAIN. SO WE TOOK HER TO THE COMMUNITY CLINIC. NONE OF US COULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT THE PARTS THE LADY. THAT WHAT WAS SEEM LIKE A STOMACH PAIN WILL BECOME GALL BLADDER CANCER. IT WAS A LONG PROCESS JUST TO GET CLOSE TO DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE COMMUNITY CLINICS ARE NOT THE SAME FOR THESE CASES. WE NEED A SPECIALIST AND MORE TEST FOR THE CLINIC GET AN OFFER. WE TRIED DIFFERENT PLACES BUT MOST DON'T TAKE CARE. OF MOVES ON TAKE PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE THE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH. OR THE WAIT TIME FOR TOO LONG. BUT YOU HAD A LIVER KEPT COMING IN AND OUT OF THE LOCAL EMERGENCY ROOM. IT WAS ONLY AFTER SHE WENT TO THE ER AND UC'S FUND IT WILL MEDICAL CENTER. THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO GET PROPER ASSESSMENT. AT THAT POINT THE DOCTOR WAS ABLE TO COME FROM THE HEART TRUTH. THE SHE HAD FINAL STAGE CALLED BLADDER CANCER. THE DOCTOR THINKS THAT THE CANCER HAD ALREADY BEEN SPREADING OVER FOR OVER FIVE YEARS. THIS WHOLE LAUNCH IWIN WITHOUT SEEING A DOCTOR. EXPLAIN THAT EARLY SYMPTOMS COULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSED FOR FACT THAT JUST THE PROBLEMS. THE NATIONAL WEBER HAD NEVER VISIT A DOCTOR BECAUSE HE WAS OUT OF HER BUDGET. ONCE SHE FIVE HAD FINAL STAGE CANCER THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO ANYMORE. FOR YOU HAND OVER PASSED AWAY SURROUNDED BUT ALL HER KIDS AND GRANDKIDS ON HER HOSPITAL BED AFTER TWO WEEKS OF FINALLY RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT. THOSE WERE THE LONG AND PAINFUL WEEKS FOR MYFAMILY AND I THE WOMAN WHO HAD TAKING CARE OF ALL OF US INCLUDING ME. QUITE EVEN SURE BLOOD WITH HER. WAS DYING IN A HOSPITAL BED AND THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO. WE ALL KEPT ASKING OURSELVES WHAT SHE COULD HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TO CROWN OR REGULAR DOCTOR VISITS. WHAT IS SHE WAS NOT UNDOCUMENTED? WHAT IS SHE WAS ABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE? ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. GETTING PROPER MEDICAL CARE EARLY COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE LOSS OF THE NATIONAL REVERSE. A COMMUNITY LEADER AND THE CITY OF A SCHOOL IN THE LOW. WHO WAS THE HEART OF OUR MY FAMILY? WHO WOULD I NEED TO DO TO SEE HER SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO SEE HER SUFFER WITHOUT A WAY OF PREVENTING OR STOPPED HER PAIN? WHO WOULDN'T BE LEFT WITH THE OWN PAY MEDICAL BILLS AND NOW WE HAVE STRUGGLING TO PAY? MY FAMILY AND I ADVOCATE ARE ADVOCATES FOR HEALTH FOR ALL ADULTS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO GO THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE JUST WENT THROUGH. WE BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER OR DIE. FROM A TREATABLE CONDITION NO MATTER WHERE THEY WERE POINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I ACTUALLY WENT TAKE A MOMENT TO CALL THE ROLL SINCE WE HAVE A QUORUM A SECRETARY CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN. AND IS HERE STONE. STONE IS HERE DRAGO. DURAZO'S HERE GROW. HER TADO. HER TOES HERE LEYVA. MITCHELL MONNING RUBIO. RUBIO IS HERE. THE FORM OF A QUORUM THANK YOU -- YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MINUTES LEFT SO OVER THE REMAINING SPEAKERS WELCOME ABSOLUTELY. A GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEEPENING ACNE SHOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF SB TWENTY NINE TO EXTEND MEDI CAL. I'M TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS -- ONE INTO CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA HAS AN IMMIGRANT HAS AN IMMIGRANT PARENT AND ONE IN SIX CHILDREN HAS AND UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS. AND A YOU JUST HEARD THESE PARENTS ALONG WITH OLDER SIBLINGS AND GRANDPARENTS CONTINUE BE SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDED FROM ACCESSING CRITICAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES. LILIAN STORY AS WELL COUNTLESS OTHERS SHOWS THAT THE PAINFUL REALITY THAT FAMILY SEPARATION IS NOT JUST THE RESULT OF WALLS AND BANDS THAT FAMILY SEPARATION CAN ALSO RESULT. FROM DEEP INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS BETWEEN AND THEIR FAMILIES AND HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND YET AND WEREN'T COMMUNITIES LIVED WITH THIS FEAR -- WE RECENTLY CONDUCTED A STUDY WHICH FOUND HIGH IN THE LIVES OF ANXIETY AND TRAUMA ACROSS THE STATE AND IMMIGRANT FAMILIES -- SINCE NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT URGENTLY NEED PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE. UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS CONTRIBUTE THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND MAKE UP ONE TENTH OF OUR STATE'S WORK FORCE WHEN AND UNDOCUMENTED ADULT GETS INJURED ON THE JOB THEY HAVE A FEW OPTIONS TO ACCESS CARE FOR INJURIES AND OFTENTIMES THE RESULT IS PERMANENT DISABILITY OR DEATH. NOW MORE THAN EVER CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP AND CARING. FOR AN UPHOLDING THE DIGNITY OF OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND WE HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL AND RESOURCES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN TOGETHER AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB TWENTY NINE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JESSICA MORAN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA I'M PROUD TO BE HERE AS A SPONSOR IMPELLED SUPPORTER OF SB TWENTY NINE WHICH EXPAND MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TO ALL ADULTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. A SPENDING MEDICAL TO ALL LOW INCOME ELIGIBLE ADULTS REGARDLESS IMMIGRATION STATUS WOULD -- ALLOW US TO HAVE ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION ADULTS IN ROLE BY TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WOULD DECREASE CALIFORNIA'S UNINSURED RATE BY A QUARTER. LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE OFTEN OFFERED DOBBY'S INSURANCES SIMILAR TO MANY LAWFULLY PRESENT LOW INCOME WORKERS HOWEVER 90% OF UNDOCUMENTED LOW INCOME WORKERS DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPARED TO ONLY 10% OTHER LAWFULLY PRESENT COUNTERPARTS. CURRENTLY THEY ARE OFFERED RESTRICTED SCOPE EMERGENCY MEDICAL BUT THAT ONLY COVERS EMERGENCIES IT'S STABILIZE THE PATIENT BUT ISN'T TREAT WHAT MIGHT BE A CHRONIC CONDITION. THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PRIME PERMIT -- PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS PREVENTIVE SERVICES OR EVEN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. MOST OF THE TIME THEY ARE TALKING GO WITHOUT CARE THE ELEMENTS. AND DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE THEY MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO COUNTY BASED -- HEALTH PROGRAMS BUT IN MANY RURAL AREAS THOSE SEEKING THAT'S ARE UNAVAILABLE. NOT HAVING US ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IT MEANS THAT THE ONLY ONE SICKNESS OR INJURY AWAY FROM FINANCIAL CALAMITY DUE TO MOUNTING MEDICAL BILLS AND HIGH MEDICAL COSTS. BY PASSING SB TWENTY NINE WE CAN ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN OUR STATE HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT REGARDLESS OF THE IMMIGRATION STATUS FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND IN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COURAGE IN COMING YEAR TRAINS STORY AND NOW THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT THANK YOU.

OKAY SEEING NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THEIR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SENATOR ALSO WELCOME TO THE AIS IS THIS YOUR FIRST BILL YES SIR SENDING. YOU PRESENTED IT WELL CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU SHOOTER PRESENTATION AND I APPRECIATE -- SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME OUT. FORGIVE ME BECAUSE I'M KIND OF LOSING MY VOICE WHICH BATMAN SIDE I'LL PROBABLY LIKE THAT BUT YOU'RE SEEING DEMOCRACY IN ACTION HERE TODAY. SO -- IN AND IT'S A IT'S A WONDERFUL EXPERIMENT -- I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW FOR FOUR YEARS AND STARTING MY SECOND TERM AND ONE OF MY MY ISSUES. BIG ISSUES IN THE STATE HAS BEEN WITH THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. THAT -- DURING THE 200-082-0009 RECESSION -- WE GAVE SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO THE PROGRAM 10%. THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY REINSTATED WE WE'VE HAD SOME PROPOSITION MONEY THIS BEEN BACK FILLING -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PHYSICIANS THE WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM PUTTING MANAGED CARE ASIDE. BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T PAY. AN APPROPRIATE FEE FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE [inaudible] AND SO. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR JUST RE RELEASED A REPORT -- IT WAS JUST THIS LAST WEEK MILLIONS OF CHILDREN IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM WERE NOT RECEIVING PREVENTATIVE HEALTH SERVICES AND I KNOW THAT THE THE CHAIRMAN UNDERSTANDS AS BEING -- IN THE STEAM THE PEDIATRICIAN. AN AVERAGE AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN THE MEDICARE ALL OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND NOT RECEIVED ALL OF THE PRESENTED PREVENTATIVE HEALTH SERVICES THAT THE STATE IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDE THEM. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH AN ANNUAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES SAVES THOUSANDS OF LIVES A REDUCES FUTURE HEALTH COSTS BY THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER CHILD. SO ONE OF MY CONCERNS SENATOR IS THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN. BUT HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERING THE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN PROMISED. TO THE BENEFICIARIES AS THEY EXIST TODAY. BY INCLUDING THIS POPULATION -- WE ARE GOING TO BE ADDING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO THE MEDICAL ROLES -- AT SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN NO -- AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THIS IS GONNA COSTS IN THE IN YOUR BILL BUT I BELIEVE IT'S IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE ALL UNDOCUMENTED IS WITH -- MEDI CAL OF SERVICES AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME CERTAINLY IF I'M WRONG. BY ADDING AT THIS NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO THE EXISTING. ROLES THAT ARE GOING TO BE SEEN BY. THE FEW POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE IS GOING TO EVEN FOR THE DELUDE. THE AVAILABILITY OF PHYSICIANS TO SEE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM TODAY. SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS. WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO TO GET THE MEDICAL SYSTEM IN SHAPE SO THAT WE CAN REALLY SAY THAT IT IS HEALTHY TO ACCEPT MORE PATIENCE NUMBER ONE NUMBER -- TWO DO YOU AVE ANY IDEA IF YOU'RE GOING TO CAP THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE ENROLLED IN THIS PROGRAM OR YOU'RE GOING TO CAP. THE AMOUNT OF EXPENDITURE IN THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE I'M GONNA SUGGESTED OPINED THAT IF WE PASS THIS IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNS AND AS HE'S INDICATED THAT HE PROBABLY WILL. THAT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE IMMIGRANTS COMING INTO CALIFORNIA TO SEEK THE SERVICES THAT -- SO WE DON'T HEAR SOME OF THE TERRIBLE STORIES THAT WE WE SEE SO. IF YOU CANCEL QUESTIONS HERE. WELL LET ME START WITH THE LAST -- ONE I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE. WITH -- IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND IMMIGRANT WORKERS. AND I CAN ASSURE YOU. THAT THE REASON THEY COME TO THIS COUNTRY IS NOT FOR THE HEALTH [inaudible] HEALTH CARE. ON THAT IS NOT WHAT DRIVES THEM. WHAT DRIVES THEM IS WHAT PUSHES THEM OUT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES? EIGHT LIVE IN ABSOLUTE. LIFE AND DEATH POVERTY THAT IS WHY THEY RISK THEIR LIVES THAT IS WHY HUNDRED DIE EACH YEAR. CROSSING THE BORDER. SO AT THAT KIND OF CLARITY OR THEY FACE ENORMOUS VIOLENCE. IN WHICH THEY CAN. EVERY DAY MEMBERS OF THE FAMILIES FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ARE GETTING KILLED BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE SO. I ASSURE YOU AFTER MANY DECK COMMUNITY. HEALTH INSURANCE OR HAVING A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT DRIVES THEM THEY WOULD PREFER TO STAY IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. ARM WITH REGARDS -- TO YOU KNOW I AM NOT YET AN EXPERT ON MEDI CAL SO I I COULDN'T PRETEND TO ANSWER SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND THERE MAY BE OTHERS. HERE BUT I WOULD SAY. OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS AN EFFICIENT SYSTEM. AN EFFICIENT SYSTEM THAT GIVES HEALTH CARE. TO ALL. IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO RESORT. TO ONLY EMERGENCY SERVICES -- AND I THINK WE SHOULD GET MORE OF THOSE NUMBERS. BABY TO TERM FOR ME TO REALLY BACKED THAT UP BUT I KNOW HAVING BEEN INVOLVED WITH HEALTH CARE -- PLANS. FOR OVER DECADES. THAT AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE PROVIDERS AND TO SAY KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE THE COST IS SO HIGH. AND RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE PUSHING THEM TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS WE'RE STILL PAYING CALIFORNIANS ARE PAIN FOR THOSE EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES WE'RE PAYING FOR LAST MINUTE. UP VISITS -- SO IT'S NOT LIKE THERE THERE AND WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUT ANY MONEY RIGHT NOW WE'RE PAYING. QUESTION FOR US IS DO WE HAVE A SMARTER PLAN. TO COVER THEM AT THE GIVEN THE ATTENTION. WE IF WE DO NOT GIVE IT IT'S NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SUFFER. BUT IMAGINE THE PREVENT THE PREVENTION OF DIABETES THE PREVENTION OF RESPIRATORY. AILMENTS THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT COST US. BILLIONS I CAN GUARANTEE YOU BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET SMARTER. ABOUT THINKING THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE SAVING MONEY WHEN IN FACT WE'RE SPENDING MORE. SO -- I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS FOR YOU AND WE'LL WORK ON IT MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE HERE WHO. CAN PROVIDE THAT -- BUT THAT'S THE WAY I'VE SEEN. THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE MY WHOLE LIFE I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS AND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMPASSION AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION. FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE TODAY -- I'M UNFORTUNATELY NOT GOING TO GO TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND NOT LET ME EXPLAIN WHY. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE NOT A COMPASSIONATE STATE I THINK WE ARE COMPASSIONATE STATE WHEN I USE MY PERSONAL MONEY. HI I DONATE TO CAUSES THAT HELP UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT -- BUT WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT TAXPAYER MONEY. AND USUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT BILLS YOU HAVE TO MAKE A NEXUS TO THE BUDGET OF THE STATE. AND SO THIS IS GOING TO BE -- A VERY EXPENSIVE -- LAW. IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS MAYBE MORE AS YOU PROBABLY SAID. SO IT BASICALLY COMES TO A MATTER OF PRIORITIZATION IN THE STATE BUDGET. AND WE ARE A STATE THAT HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT HOMELESS ISSUE. WE HAVE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE PER CAPITA -- WE HAVE -- VETERANS THAT ARE IN DIRE NEED OF OF HELP -- WE HAVE SENIOR CITIZENS THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES -- SO. AS WE LOOK AT BILLS LIKE THIS WE GOT TO TAKE IT IN THE CONTEXT OF PRIORITIZING THE THE NEEDS OF OF THE STATE. AND IF IF MONEY WAS LIMóN LESS I WOULD BE JOINING YOU 1100% THE MONEY IS NOT LIMITLESS IT IS FINITE. AND BASED ON THE NUMBERS ARE COMING INTO THE STATE COFFERS THESE DAYS -- WE'RE SEEING -- MAYBE A DOWNWARD TREND IN OUR PROJECTIONS. SO IN THAT WILL LIMIT WHAT ARE SPENDING CAN BE. BUT I THINK THAT THESE OTHER NEEDS AND AND OUR CHILDREN -- THAT WE'VE BEEN APART PROVIDE EARLY HEAD CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ALL THESE PROGRAMS HAVE PRICE TAGS. AND I THINK IN MY MIND THOSE ALREADY RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE CITIZENS THAT ARE HERE. THAT ARE DOCUMENTED AND THEN WE HAVE THE KIND OF MONEY THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER POPULATIONS IN AND PHILANTHROPIC AND CHARITABLE WAYS I WON HER PERCENT BEHIND IT. BUT AT THIS POINT TIME I CREDIT ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE THEY WERE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING THESE THESE DAYS AND AT BUT IT PROCEDURE YOUR PASSION AND YOU BRING IN THE BEFORE. THANK YOU ASSN RUBIO. THANK YOU. WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME THANK GOD. OUR COLLEAGUE US SENATOR DROPS OF FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP AND DIE I TO ONE OF ALLOCATE SOME OF THE THE COMMENTS THAT MR STONE MADE IN TERMS OF A SYSTEM THAT WHERE WE HAVE CHILDREN THAT NEED SERVICES ARE NOT GETTING SERVICES WITH. MY OPINION THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE GETS THE CARE THAT THEY DESERVE -- BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE THAT CAME TO SPEAK TODAY SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND MYSELF APPEAR TO SEE THE FACES BEHIND THE STORIES I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOU ARE SHARING I HEARD A COUPLE OF SPEAKERS -- DISCUSS SOME OF THEIR LOVED ONES THAT ARE NO LONGER WITH US AND SO THANK YOU FOR THAT TIME -- AND I KNOW THAT OUR COLLEAGUE OF MR ALSO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US AND PROVIDE US THE INFORMATION WE NEED -- AND IF I MAY I WANT TO SEE IF YOU YEAH. OKAY YEAH THAT'LL IS A GLASS OF CIRCLES BUT IS THAT A KEY IS MORE IMPORTANT THEY THAT LESS GOT US A BILL OF PERSONAL NOTHING PARKED OUT US UP OR NOT BEEN AS THEY WILL. AYE SCANDAL HAVING IT ALL. FREE DOCUMENT THAT I ONLY ONE CAN BE SPOTTED IS STILL COMPETE IN THE LINES THEY WOULD BE DONE. BY SEALING EVE STATUS SEKI AUSTIN ON THE FINANCE YEAH GARCIA. THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR REMEMBER [inaudible] OKAY. BUT ACTUALLY CENTER MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIR US SINCE WE ARE IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE I'M GOING TO FOCUS MY QUESTIONS ON THE POLICY OF THE BILL NOT THE PRICE TAG. I'M SURE THEY'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT COST -- MR ALSO -- I DO HAVE A CONCERN WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC CHARGE -- A DEEP CONCERN THAT IF THE STATE WERE TO STEP UP AND AND MAKE. MEDI CAL -- AVAILABLE TO ALL THOSE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE BUT FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. GIVEN -- WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL NOW ARTS WORK COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE SEEN -- MIXED STATUS FAMILIES WHO WHO ARE NOT. ARE SIGNING UP FOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR OUT OF FEAR. OF THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC CHARGE AND THAT IT WILL BE LEVERAGED AGAINST THEM BY THIS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- DO YOU SHARE MY SAME CONCERN -- WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC CHARGIN AND IF NOT WHY WILL WHAT COULD WE DO IF THIS WERE TO BECOME LAW. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DO INDEED STEP UP AND SIGN UP BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE WILL BE. IF WE INDEED FUND MEDI CAL FOR ALL VERY LIKELY THERE WILL BE AN EXPECTATION THAT WEWILL REAP SAVINGS FROM THE SAFETY NET AREAS WHERE. THIS POPULATION CURRENTLY RECEIVE SERVICES. SO I WOULDN'T WANT US TO PULL DOLLARS BACK FROM THOSE AREAS WELL WE DON'T GET THE UP TAKE A MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT OUT OF FEAR. YOU FOLLOW ME. WHAT WHAT SAY YOU [inaudible] WELL -- DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FINAL OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FINAL DECISION WILL BE ON PUBLIC CHARGE. WE DON'T KNOW HOW BROAD OR HOW DEEP THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC CHARGE COULD BE ARE IN FACT IT COULD BE. FOR GETTING A FREE MEAL. ALL IN SCHOOL. IF IF THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE EVIL ENOUGH TO PUT THAT FORWARD. I DON'T THINK THEN THAT SHOULD PUSHES BACK FROM. CONTINUING TO PROVIDE THE NEEDS OF THIS COMMUNITY I THINK THIS COULD BE A NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE AT EVERY LEVEL. I'D I WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY -- BY THE GOING FURTHER UNDERGROUND. ON A ON A LOT OF OTHER LEVELS AND IT IS A BIG CONCERN. I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD HOLD US BACK THAT WERE THEIR UNDERGROUND MAYBE IF WE PUT RESOURCES AND THERE WE COULD GET MORE INCOME TO THE STATE LIKE WAY TO THE LEFT. ALL WAGE THEFT -- IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALL BY ITSELF COULD PAY FOR THIS AND MORE HEALTH CARE. SO MAYBE IF WE INVESTED OUR RESOURCES THE RIGHT WAY NOT ONLY WOULD WE ADDRESS WAGE THEFT AND BRING IN MORE MONEY BUT WE WOULD BEGIN TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY. THAT THIS STATE. REALLY SEES EVERYONE AS EQUALS WE'RE GONNA APPLY OUR PROTECTIONS ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE LEGAL WAY -- I'M SURE THERE IS A MORE TECHNICAL WAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT I HAVE NEVER. SEEN [inaudible] US WITHDRAW. WHEN THERE'S FURTHER ATTACKS ON THE RIGHTS AND ON THE COMMUNITY AND THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE COMMUNITY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT ON MANY WAY ON MANY FRONTS ON THE CENSUS FRONT? THERE ARE MANY WAYS IN WHICH OUR COMMUNITY WILL WANT TO BE FURTHER PUSHED OUT AND WAY. AND WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP AND THIS IS ONE WAY OF CONTINUING TO STEP UP FOR THIS PART OF OUR COMMUNITY. I T&lt;c.cyan&gt; I THANK YOU FOR THAT&lt;/c&gt; RESPONSE I I JUST THINK THAT -- IT IS THE VERY REAL -- BARRIER ON AND WE'RE SEEING IT IN EXISTING PROGRAMS AND AND WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF YOU KNOW IF THIS WERE TO BECOME LAW WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A CONCERTED EFFORT IN TERMS OF OUT REGION EDUCATE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE A REALISTIC IN TERMS OF OUR UP. TAKE NUMBERS -- WE SHOULD YOU KNOW BASE OUR EXPERIENCE OUR REALITY VERSES. AREWANT FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE HEALTHCARE AND SO I JUST WANT TO BE MINDFUL THAT THIS IS IS. THAT IF CALIFORNIA WHERE TO DO IT IT'S NOT HAPPEN IN A VACUUM IT IS A PIECE OF A BROADER -- CONVERSATION AROUND THE EXPERIENCE OF A OF AN IMMIGRANT IMMIGRANT FAMILY IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE I JUST THINK WANT US TO BE MINDFUL ON A GO FORWARD BASIS -- ABOUT HOW WE WOULD DO OUT REACH WHO THE KEY MESSAGES WOULD BE ABOUT -- HAD A ROLE IN THIS PROGRAM ECSTATIC CETERA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU -- LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE I WAS PRESENTING A BILL AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY HAD REALLY WANTED TO HEAR FROM EVERYONE. BUT I JUST WANT TO THINK OF SENATOR ALSO FOR REALLY HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING AFTER SHE WAS ELECTEDIN BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- HEALTH CARE WHEN I LOOK AROUND THE ROOM AND I LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM. WE ARE ALL THE SAME WE ARE ALL PART OF THE HUMAN RACE WE ALL HAVE A BODY AND OUR HEALTH AS INDICATED BY MS CENTER STONE. OUR HEALTH IS FINITE AND IT IS NOT INFINITE AND IF WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES OR WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. THAT OUR LIFESPAN IS SHORTENED AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUCCESS SOCIETY. I LOOK FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN HEALTH CARE IS NOT A PRIVILEGE AND IT IS A RIGHT THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY IN THIS STATE HAS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE. WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST OF YOU KNOW BEFORE I CAME HERE? AND I STILL REMEMBER THE SIXTY TWO THOUSAND WORKERS WHO WENT ON STRIKE AT ALBERTSONS RALPHS VONS THAT WAS IN 200-032-0004. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I WOULD WANT TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES WITH YOU FIGHTING. FOR UNTIL WE MAKE IT HAPPEN SO I THINK YOU AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR NGUYEN EVER APPROPRIATE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO -- I I JUST WANNA SAY FIRST OF ALL -- THANK YOU SENATOR AS A FOR RAIN THIS BILL FORD AND THAT'S GREAT THIS IS THE FIRST BILL OR HEARING AND THE SESSION FOR OUR COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND SO -- SO IT'S A PLEASURE FOR ME IS THE CHAIR OF THE HAT TO HEAR THIS BILL FIRST AND DOES WELL AS I KNOW THIS IS YOUR FIRST BILL PRESENTING HERE.

WITH MORE EFFICIENT -- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND I HAVE MY GOOD FRIEND THE CENTER STONE NINE WE WITH ALONG WITH CENTER TADO WE SIT UNDER THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- NO WE WE WANT TO MAKE MEDI CAL BETTER -- BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT -- IT FOR ALL THE FLAWS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM IN DECEMBER IT'S A GOOD PROGRAM IN MANY WAYS THERE'S CHALLENGES AND OTHERS. IT'S CERTAINLY BETTER TO BE A MEDIC HOW THE AB STRAIGHT SO SO SO WE NEED TO GIVE THAT OPPORTUNITY -- I ALSO -- RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE -- SIR MITCHELL'S WAS THEM ABOUT THE REALITY ON THE GROUND -- BUT CERTAINLY WITHOUT YOUR BILL WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY IF THEY WISH TO SIGN UP RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO I MEAN WE HAVE WORK TO DO ON THE GROUND. WE STILL KNOW HOW NEED TO SUPPORT CLINICS IS OVER BECAUSE IT WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE FEARFUL OF SIGNING UP AND UNFORTUNATELY. DODD -- BECAUSE OF RULES REGULATIONS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- DEATH YOU MAY HAVE SOME REALITY AND WE STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM ALTERNATE OPTIONS THEY MAY NOT BE WILLING. TO BUT WITHOUT YOUR BILL WE CAN EVEN OFFER THEM THE OPPORTUNITY EITHER THEY OVERCAME THIS YEAR. SO -- WE CERTAINLY HAVE YOU KNOW THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE SO WE SELL TO WORK ON THE MONEY SIDE. AT ONE HITS APPROPRIATIONS -- BUT CERTAINLY IN MY VIEW -- OUR POLICY SHOULD BE TOWARD TRYING TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE COVERAGE HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT AND THAT -- AND THIS IS CERTAINLY A MAJOR STEP FORWARD IN THAT DIRECTION AND SO WITH THAT CERTAINLY -- I URGE THE I SELL I HEARD IN MOTION -- WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE AND DRAWS SO.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL IT IS MUCH APPRECIATED. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS ON THE LAST PAGE OF THE ANALYSIS. FOR MANY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO EXPAND AND PROTECT FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES. RECENT CHANGES IN FEDERAL POLICIES JEOPARDIZE ACCESS TO QUALITY FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES. FAMILY PACK IS A MEDICAID PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. DH CS. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES LOW INCOME WOMEN AND MEN WITH ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES FAMILY BACK SERVICE SERVICES INCLUDE ALL FDA APPROVED CONTRACEPTIVE MESSAGE METHODS. EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTIVES TESTING AND TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS ALONG WITH SCREENINGS FOR BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER. FAMILY PICTURES ONE POINT ONE MILLION LOW INCOME AND UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGH TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS CURRENTLY FAMILY PACK IS FUNDED BY A NINETY TEN FEDERAL MATCH MEANING THAT FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR INVESTED IN FAMILY PLANNING CARE. THE STATE RECEIVES NINETY CENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS FEDERAL PROPOSALS IN TWO STATES FORM PROPOSAL OR OTHER SIMILAR NATURE OR TO BE IMPLEMENTED THE CURRENT MATCH FOR FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA COULD BE THREATENED. WITHOUT A PLAN IN PLACE ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME AND ENSURE CALIFORNIANS COULD BE DISRUPTED AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SB THREE ONE PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR THAT PLANNING. IN THE EVENT OF REDUCTIONS IN FEDERAL FUNDING SB THREE OH ONE WOULD REQUIRE DH CS. TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF ANY FEDERAL ACTION THAT WOULD ALTER CURRENT FINANCING ENSURING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILY PACK PROGRAM. HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS SYLVIA CASTILLO FROM ESSENTIAL ACCESS HEALTH. EIGHT THANK YOU WELCOME.

AND THE PROGRAM HAS CONTINUOUSLY PROVEN ITS SUCCESS. PROGRAM EVALUATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE UC SAN FRANCISCO UC SAN FRANCISCO HAS SHOWN MULTIPLE TIMES THAT EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON THE PROGRAM. THE PUBLIC SECTOR SAVE MORE THAN NINE DOLLARS AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE EXPENSES. OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES FAMILY PACKED AND THE TITLE TEN FEDERAL FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM HAVE PARTNERED TO REDUCE UNINTENDED PREGNANCY RATES IN OUR STATE O HISTORIC LOWS. IN THE IN THE LAST THIRTY IN IN A THIRTY FOR YOUR REDUCE ITS TEEN PREGNANCY RATE BY 70% AND THIS IS LARGELY THANKS TO THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM. TRUMP PENT ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY ATTACKED HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AND ACCESS TO SEXUAL A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. INCLUDING ALSO ATTEMPTING TO SHIFT MEDICAID FUNDING INTO BLOCK FUNDING WHICH WOULD THREATEN THE NINETY TEN THE NINETY TEN A FUNDING MATCH BY THE FAT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. CALIFORNIA MUST TAKE STEPS TO PLAN FOR ALL SCENARIOS INCLUDING A POTENTIAL FUNDING LOSS FOR THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM. A TO PROTECT ACCESS TO VITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY ENACTED SEVERAL MEASURES TO HOLD THE LINE AND PROTECT ACCESS TO SEXUAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE FACE OF HOSTILE. ACTIONS ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND SO SB THRILL ONE WOULD CALL ON THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO CREATE A SUSTAINABILITY PLAN FOR FAMILY PACK SHOULD FEDERAL FUNDING CHANGES OCCUR.

NO WE HAVEN'T [inaudible] THERE [inaudible] I WANT. HELLO CENTER PAN WELCOME THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH AND THE BOOK OVER TO VINCE IN ALREADY HERE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR -- ENTERED ALRIGHT SB ONE FIFTY FOUR WILL MAKE SILVER DIAMOND FLOWRIDER STF AVAILABLE FIRST DATA CAL BENEFICIARIES PARTICULARLY YOUNG CHILDREN PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND ADULTS IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. TO THE K. IS THE MOST COMMON CHRONIC CONDITION EXPERIENCED BY CHILDREN. EVEN AS A PEDIATRICIAN I HAVE TO MEET THAT -- FAR MORE COMMON THAN ASTHMA OR HAY FEVER STF IS A TOPICAL MEDICATION USED TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP DENTAL DECAY IN BOTH THE BABY AND PERMANENT TEETH. SILVER KILLS THE BACTERIA AND STOPS NEW BACTERIA FROM GROWING. AND THE FLUORIDE RE MINERALIZED IS A HARD TO TO STRUCTURE IN ADDITION TO SURROUNDING TEETH MAY ALSO RECEIVE ANTI COUNTY PROTECTION. SINCE. THIS TREATMENT AS OFFICIAL FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO DENTAL TREATMENT AND PRESENT CHALLENGES READING RECEIVING TRADITIONAL TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS. PRIVATE PRACTICE AND IT'S ARE INCREASINGLY USING STF TO STOP DENTAL DECAY IN AT LEAST THIRTEEN OTHER STATES COVER THIS TREATMENT IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. THE BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO MAKE SB A COVERED BENEFIT. FOR DEBT TO CAL ENROLLEES AS A TREATMENT OPTION. FOR TOOTH DECAY I EXPECT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE NAY WITNESSES SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS DARIA GREW ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBER DENTISTS ACROSS THE STATE. PROBABLY SPONSORING SB. ONE FIFTY FOUR AS DOCTOR PAN SAID THE BILL ADDS SILVER DIAMOND FLUORIDE AS A DENTAL BENEFIT FOR SOME MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL. DRILLING THAT REQUIRES SHOTS OF LOCAL ANESTHETIC AND I'M. BUT AND DRILLING OF THE TO STRUCTURE. THIS TREATMENT IS NON INVASIVE MORE COMFORTABLE FOR THE PATIENT. AND LESS EXPENSIVE. LET'S TALK A LOOK TOPICAL LIQUID THAT IS SIMPLY BRUSHED ON TO THE CAVITY THAT CAN PREVENT CURRENT DECAY AND ALSO PREVENT NEW DISEASE PROGRESSION IN THE FUTURE. IT MAY NOT FULLY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL DENTAL CARE TREATMENT BUT DENNIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE ALREADY INCORPORATING THIS IN THEIR PRACTICE. ARE DENNIS FIND IT CAN BE PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL FOR THE CARE OF CERTAIN POPULATIONS AS DOCTOR PAN MENTION. FOR EXAMPLE IN YOUNG CHILDREN WITH SIGNIFICANT TO QUE STF TREATMENT CAN BE USED IN LIEU OF COSTLY AND STRESSFUL GENERAL ANESTHESIA UNTIL THE CHILD IS OLD ENOUGH TO SIT STILL FOR FILLINGS OR NATURALLY LOSE THE BABY TEETH. STF DOES TYPICALLY BECAUSE A BLACK DISCOLORATION. ON THE PART OF THE TOOTH IN WHICH TWO K. IS ALREADY STARTED. DESPITE THAT DENTISTS AND FAMILIES FIND IT A USEFUL TREATMENT OPTION FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FRAIL ELDERLY PATIENTS AND OTHER PATIENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE TRADITIONAL TREATMENT. BECAUSE OF THIS THE BILL IS LIMITED AND LIMITS THE SCOPE OF BENEFITS TO THE THREE POPULATIONS MENTIONED CHILDREN SIX AND UNDER ADULTS WHO LIVE IN SNIFFED OR LICENSED INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES. AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WHERE TRADITIONAL RESTORATIVE TREATMENT IS NOT OPTIMAL. ADDITIONALLY IT REQUIRES APPROPRIATE INFORMED CONSENT WHICH NOTIFIES THE CARE GIVERS ARE PARENTS ABOUT THE RISKS BENEFITS AND OTHER POTENTIAL TREATMENT OPTIONS. SO THAT THE PARENTS OR THE CARE GIVER AND THE DENTIST CAN MAKE. THE BEST POSSIBLE DECISION THE PATIENT -- WE HAVE POLL DENTISTS ARE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEY TELL US THAT IT IS ALREADY BEING INCORPORATED INTO A LARGE NUMBER OF DENTAL PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE. INCLUDING -- DOES WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE THE VA COMMUNITY CLINICS AND CASH PAY PATIENTS CITY BELIEVES THAT STF SHOULD ALSO BE A TREATMENT OPTION IN THE MEDICAL DENTAL PROGRAM. THIS LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT STF IS AN AVAILABLE OPTION IN A DENTIST TO ABOUT WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT MEMBERS MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES REPRESENTING THE OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT OKAY. GLAD TO BE BACK WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DO WE HAVE ANY. PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] SEEING THEM. COME COME BACK TO THE CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MR AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I'M SUPPORTIVE BUT I JUST TO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE. ONE OF THE INCENTIVES HERE'S THAT IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A TREATMENT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE THE CAUSE MEDIC IMPACT IS THERE ANY DISTINCTION MADE BY A TREATING DENTIST FOR A CHILD IF IT. TO BACK TO THROUGH HER FRONT TOOTH IN TERMS OF THE COSMETIC IMPACT. I KNOW THE BABY TEETH FALL OUT BUT STILL FOR A THE KINDERGARTEN -- FIRST GRADER -- HE COULD TIAS STIGMATIZING -- TREATMENT SELECTION. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION -- SO CERTAINLY WHEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS TREATMENT IS IS THAT DOES CAUSE A DISCOLORATION TO TOOTH CAUSES IT TO THAT THE DARK IN COLOR WHERE IT'S APPLIED. AND ONE THING I'D MAKE NOTE IS MEANT AND THAT'S WHY WITH WE'VE PARTICULARLY TARGETED -- THESE THREE POPULATIONS AND IN INTERMS OF OFTENTIMES THESE ARE PATIENTS WHERE. DID PATIENT MAY NEED SEDATION OR OTHER TYPES OF WHICH MAY BE NOT AS READILY ACCESSIBLE AND SO IDEALLY IF PATIENTS ABLE TO TOLERATE AND RELEASE AS FULL WE WOULD JUST GO AND DO THE FILLING RIGHT AND GET AND GET IT DONE RIGHT TAKE CARE TAKE CARE OF THE DENTAL. CARIES HOWEVER -- IN OUT IN THOSE OTHER CASES THE ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT THIS TREATMENT ALSO DOES IT THE REST THE FURTHER PROGRESSION SO WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE A DENTAL CARIES RIGHT. AND IT'S AND YOU SAY WELL I CAN'T TREAT IT NOW BECAUSE I CAN'T PUT HIM UNDER SEDATION I DON'T HAVE THE THE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS USING THIS TREATMENT ACTUALLY ARRESTED FOR THE PROGRESSIONS WHAT I SEE IS A PEDIATRICIAN AS I HAVE A PATIENT COMES AND WHO HAS A DENTAL. CARIES AND THEN WILL HAPPEN IS THAT BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET HIM INTO THE OTHER FACILITY. IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT BY THE WAY HOW WE TALK ABOUT BABY TEETH YOUR ADULT TEETH RIGHT BEHIND SO WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR CHILD ISN'T A BABY TEETH YOU KNOW THE DAHLE TEETH COMING STREET. RIGHT BEHIND AND ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN'T THE CAT THE CAVITY OR DENTAL CARIES WILL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THE BABY TEETH IT ACTUALLY AFFECT THE ADULT TO BEFORE EVEN POPS OUT. SO THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THIS IS AN OPTION TO HOPE THAT PROGRESSION I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT'S ONE THE REASONS WHY I THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT WE MAKE THIS A COVERED ENTITY I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION I STILL THINK THERE'S A BIT OF AN ECONOMIC -- DETERMINANT HERE I UNDERSTAND SEDATION RAISES OTHER POTENTIAL MEDICAL RISKS AND YOU GOTTA SEE IF THE CHILD IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR THAT IT SET TREATMENT -- IT SEEMS LIKE THIS COULD BE A TWO TRACK SYSTEM THAT POOR KIDS WILL BE. AVAILED OF THIS OPTION IN THE LONG TERM FOR THEIR DENTAL HEALTH IS BETTER THAN NO TREATMENT. BUT DATA A CHILD OF MEANS COULD FORWARD. THE OTHER TREATMENT I WOULD FIVE POINT OUT AN OBVIOUS THE THAT THIS LITTLE TRICKIER UNDER DODD TEND TO CAL MANAGED CARE WHICH IS IN SAN BOTH MY AREA WHICH IS. SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND ALL THE LA COUNTY BUT THE REST IS ACT IF YOU FOR SERVICE TO FOR THE DENNIS ON THE GROUND. THEY ACTUALLY MAKE MORE ACTUALLY FILLING THE CAVITY THAN THEY WOULD USING THIS TREATMENT SO THAT INSTEAD OF DOESN'T QUITE BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE IN A MANAGED CARE SITUATIONS FOR PAYMENT PER MONTH. THEN YOU GO ON THE GO FOR THE TRIP THE QUOTE YOU FOR TREATMENT SO OF ICE BECAUSE I'M STILL GETTING PAID A FIXED AMOUNT SO I IT WE WE CAN CERTAINLY THINK ABOUT HOW YOU WANT MY ADDRESS THAT THANK YOU SHE DID THANK YOU. SENATE MITCHELL. THANK YOU SIR I WAS JUST TAKING A LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND I SEE THAT IT ONLY. BY THE BENEFIT SHALL BE LIMITED TO CHILDREN SIX YEARS OF AGE AND UNDER SO IT'S VERY YOUNG KIDS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS ADULTS WHO LIVE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. BECAUSE WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY READILY ACCESSIBLE I WOULD BE SURE OF READILY ACCESSIBLE MET COVERAGE. MATT UP ACCESS I WASN'T SURE IT WAS READILY ACCESSIBLE. BASED ON MY ABILITY TO WITHSTAND THE AMNESIA OR IF IT WAS AN ACCESS ISSUE. WELL IT AND FOURTEEN MEDI CAL AGAIN TO CAL IS AN ACCESS ISSUE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT AND MANY TIMES -- THAN TO HELP PATIENTS HAVE A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING A SEDATION YEAH -- TREATMENTS AND SO REALLY I THINK THE TARGET POPULATION ARE THOSE PATIENTS WHO -- BASICALLY EITHER ARE NOT ABLE TO ARE EXTREMELY THE LATE TREES A TIME BEFORE THEY CAN -- GET THAT -- ACCESS TO THE FACILITIES FOR THAT FOR THE FULL TREATMENT AND SO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS TREATMENT WILL AT LEAST HOLD THE PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE SO DOESN'T GET EVEN WORSE -- WHILE WE'RE WAITING TO FINALLY GET -- THE US THE THE THE FINAL TREATMENT GOT IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. SENATE RUBIO. AND KILL I HAD THE SAME CONCERNS AS A MISTER MONEY I AND I HAD ALREADY SHARED SOME OF THE CONCERNS WITH YOU. AS IT PERTAINS TO CHILDREN UNDER SIX YEARS OF AGE I I DID ASK FOR SOME PHOTOS AND I WAS ABLE TO TO SEE WHAT THE AFFECTS ARE AND AND THEY'RE PRETTY SEVERE THINKING OF A CHILD THAT STARTS KINDERGARTEN GOES TO FIRST GRADE AND STOREHOUSES. DISCOLORATION WHICH IS AGAIN IN MY OPINION PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT DENTISTRY BUT I WANTED TO JUST GET A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM YOU. I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY MY QUESTION WOULD HAVE BEEN AS THERE MEMORY AS IT PERTAINS TO A DECADE BEFORE THE TWO FALLS AND THEN THE TWO K.. AFTER WHEN THE NEW ONE FALLS IN I THOUGHT I JUST HEARD YOU SAY THAT. THAT IS. THE ONE THAT'S COMING OUT IS COMING RIGHT AFTER THAT SOMETIMES THERE'S IMPACT TO THE NEW TOOTH CRACKED YES IT WOULD DOUBLE TO WHAT HAPPENS OF COURSE THE DENTAL CARIES IS A CUT CALL CAVITIES HOLE IN THE TOOTH RIGHT TO THE BACK TO SPEEDING THROUGH THE TOOTH. AND IF YOU HAVE A BABY TWO SETS HAS AN ADULT TO PUT WE'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND IT IF IT ACTUALLY EATS THROUGH FAR ENOUGH IT WILL THEN START ON THE ADULT TO SWITCH IS RIGHT. BEHIND THE THE BABY TOOTH SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE IF YOU DON'T STOP THE KERRY SOME CONTINUING. I CAN GO STRAIGHT INTO THE ADULT TO STEPPED THAT DID THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT -- MY OTHER QUESTION IS AND I KNOW THAT -- EVENTUALLY THAT THEY WILL FALL OUT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT STUFF WHAT HAPPENS BUT ANOTHER QUESTION FOR ME IS IS THERE ANOTHER WAY WERE MAYBE THEY CAN PULL OUT THE TEETH IN THE REASON I SAY THIS BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO SEE HIM. CHILDREN THAT NEED IT THE ONES THAT CAN AFFORD IT ALL WALKING AND NOT ALL BUT WALKING AROUND WITH DISCOLORED TEETH AND THEN THE ONES ARE MORE AFFLUENT THAT COULD AFFORD A WALKING AROUND WITH. BETTER TEETH IT JUST YOU KNOW SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU START THAT THE DIVISION IN TERMS OF EQUITY IN ECONOMICS -- I JUST WANT TO KNOW THERE'S ANY OTHER OPTIONS FOR THAT LIKE PULLING OUT A TEETH IS IN THERE AN EASIER WAY FOR A CHILD. I'M NOT A DENTIST SO I JUST KIND OF WANT. TO GET OUT ON THE MARKET SO THERE ARE -- FIRST IF THE THE TWO THIEVES STAINED BLACK WITH STF THERE ARE -- METHODS AFTER THE TOOTH IS STABILIZED -- TO GO IN AND PUT IN A WHITE FILLING OR PUT ON A VENEER -- SO THAT WE'VE STOPPED FIX THE COLORATION UNTIL THE BABY TO FALLS OUT --% IN TERMS OF OTHER OPTIONS. A LOT OF KIDS WITH SIGNIFICANT DECAY AND UP WITH SILVER CAPS ON THEIR BABY TEETH OR YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO IN AND DO SOME SOME. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DENTISTRY TO PUT CAPS ON AND SO THE PARENT MIGHT DECIDE. MAKE THE DECISION WITH THE DENTIST I'D RATHER AND AND WE SEE THIS A LOT. REGARDLESS OF ECONOMIC STATUS THE PARENTS AND THE DENTIST HAVING A CONVERSATION AND SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT I'D RATHER HAVE A BLACK STAY IN THAN HAVE -- THAT HAVE TO HAVE THEM YOU KNOW UNDERGO -- SIGNIFICANT DENTISTRY OR UNDERGO ANESTHESIA AND ON TOP OF THAT YOU YOU WOULD DEFINITELY NOT WANT TO PULL OUT A TOOTH THAT COULD BE STABILIZED OTHERWISE BECAUSE THEN. THE TEETH MOVE OR THE IT DAMAGES THE BONE SO -- YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO STABILIZE THE TWO FIRST BEFORE YOU WITH THE LAST. DITCH EFFORT WOULD BE TO PULL IT OUT. OKAY SO SEE FASTER MY QUESTION HE'S STILL A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ONLY BECAUSE I SAW TO ME THE SEVERITY OF THAT THE DISCOLORATION BUT BUT I YOU KNOW ACT. GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT HIM. AND NOW MORE SOMETHING TO TO MINIMIZE THE THE STAIN I MEAN THEY'RE STILL COST ATTACHED TO ITSELF. MY OPINION MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PARENTS WERE NOT TO HAVE SOMETHING COVER THE STING BUT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOR SURE IN AYE AYE I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN BUT I I DO UNDERSTAND THAT WE WANT TO SAY FUTURE TEETH AND MAKE SURE THAT. THEY'RE ALSO NOT WALKING AROUND WITH SILVER DETAILED SO THANK YOU FOR THAT PRECIADO. SENATOR MONEY. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO JUST ASK ONE MORE QUERY. SO WHEN YOU SEE TO THE CAN CHILDREN THIS YOUNG. IS THERE A CORRELATION WITH CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES IF YOU KNOW DOCTOR PAN OR YOUR WITNESS. SO ACTUALLY -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN LEAD TO TOOTH DECAY AND CHILDREN -- IS FOR EXAMPLE CONTINUED BOTTLE USE ARE GOING TO BED WITH THAT AND CERTAINLY -- IF IN THAT BOTTLE IS OUR SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES INCLUDING FRUIT JUICES -- HOPEFULLY NOT SODA BUT THEN THAT WOULD MAKE IT EVEN WORSE YES SO IT DOES OFTEN ACOSTA QUICKLY FRONTAL DO THINK A IS -- WE AND CHOIR OF THE PARENT THAT% THERE THE CHILD IS FREE GOING GOING AROUND LET'S USUALLY A BOTTLE IN YOUR MOUTH OR GOING TO BED WITH A VIOLENT MOUTH AUSTIN FILLED WITH -- SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE OF SOME SAMPLE SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK IT'S A HELPFUL RIGHT USE LIKE A REFUSAL TO ADDED SUGAR IN IN IT IS KNOWN. SOME FAMILIES TO PUT THE SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE IN THE BOTTLE INCLUDING SERVICE YES UNFORTUNATELY THAT THAT IS TRUE I I SAY RELUCTANTLY I'D HATE TO AGREED THAT THAT BUT YES THAT DOES HAPPEN YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. CNN CENTER MANAGER CALLS OUT WELL I I I UNDERSIDE FOR SO I'M I THINK.
