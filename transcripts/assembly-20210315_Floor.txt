IN A RIGHT TO SERVE IN OFFICE. BUT TODAY WE MUST ALSO DOUBLE DOWN ON OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE OUR STATE LEGISLATURE LOOKS MORE LIKE THE GREAT STATE WE COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT. A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE FIRST FOUR WOMAN. ELIZABETH HUGHES. ANNA SAILOR AS THE BROUGHT TO AN INJURY STORIES WERE ELECTED INTO THE STATE ASSEMBLY. IT TOOK ANOTHER HALF CENTURY AFTER THAT SELECT THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN IN THE FIRST APA WOMAN INTO THE STATE ASSEMBLY YOU MOM BURKE AND MARCH ON YOU.

THIRTY NINE YEARS AGO THE FIRST LATINA GLORIA MOLINA WAS ELECTED TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY SHE WAS ALSO MY REPRESENTATIVE. AND DURING MY TENURE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THERE WERE ONLY THREE LET THE MATH IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. EVEN THOUGH WE COMPRISE 20% OF THE POPULATION. BUT THERE IS GOOD NEWS. WELL WE DON'T HAVE PARTY YET WE DO HAVE A TEAM AT THE NECESSARY IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE TODAY. A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE FIRST WOMEN WERE ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND OUR CURRENT WOMAN CAUCUS MEMBERS CONTINUE TO MAKE HISTORY AND BREAK LAST MEANS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OUR COLLEAGUE FROM NORTH STATE WHEN IT BECAME THE THIRTY EIGHTH WOMEN TO JOIN OUR LEGISLATURE. DURING THE MOST OF THEM NEVER HAD SERVING AT ANY ONE TIME BUT STILL TWENTY TWO SECOND PARTY. SO OUR CURRENT MEMBERS HAVE BEEN THEIR FIRST TOWN- FIRST FEMALE MAYORS. SUMMARIZES UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO FACE DEPORTATION ONLY TO NOW SERVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES LEFT BEHIND EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE THEY LOVE FLEEING CIVIL WARS ON THE TO DO THEY SERVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE BROKEN RECORDS RECEIVING THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF VOTES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY OF THE LEGISLATIVE. IN LEGISLATIVE RACES.

SHE LETTER STARK BICAMERAL AND BIPARTISAN REFORM OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE'S RESPONSE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THEY BECAME A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CURRENTLY SERVING WITH US FOR THE FIRST MEDINA MAJORITY LEADER. THE PRESS THAT THE NATURE OF APPROPRIATIONS THE FIRST AND ONLY LET THE UNITED STATES- IN THE C. LETS THESE ARE FROM ORANGE COUNTY. THE FIRST REPUBLICAN AT THE NEST IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE.

BUT A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER WE FIRST GOT THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND GET ELECTED WE ONLY HAVE ONE OPENLY LGBTQ I WOMAN IN THE ASSEMBLY. SERVING WITH US ON THE RED CARPET IS THE HIGHEST RANKING AT THE END THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHEN APPOINTED AS SECRETARY OF BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES. AND HOUSING AGENCY OTHER- GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. BUT WE STILL HAVE NOT HAD A SINGLE AT THE NO SERVICE STATEWIDE OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA. AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO HAS NOTED WITH THEIR WORK ON ANYTHING THAT THE MASS. THE LATINOS ARE OFTEN THE MOST UNDERPAID AND HE'S REPRESENTED IN MOST SECTORS OF THE FIGHTING. AMONG SAYS WE HAVE THE FREE SINGLE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THE FIRST EMAIL SECRETARY OR TREASURER SIX SECRETARY TREASURER OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR. AFL-CIO THE SECOND LARGEST LABOR COUNCIL IN THE COUNTRY ONE OF THE FIRST WOMEN APPROVED TO FLY ABOARD AND EAT PT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT OVERSEAS. ONLY THE SECOND WOMAN TO HEAD A PARTY CAUCUS IN THE HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. AND THE FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD BOTH HOUSES ARE SENATE PRO TEM TONI ATKINS. I WOULDN'T CAUCUS MEMBERS HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN BREAKING GLASS CEILINGS BUT ARE UNITED TO ENSURE THAT ALL WOMEN HAVE A PATHWAY TO OVERCOME THE TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES. AND OBSTACLES THEY FACED A CONTINUOUSLY FIGHTING TO ENSURE ALL WOMEN BE TREATED RESPECTED AND PAID RIGHTFULLY WHAT WE DESERVE. AND THIS LED TO THIS THIS SESSION WILL BE ANY DIFFERENT. EXCEPT THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER EXACERBATED AND HIGHLIGHTED THE WORK WE NEED TO DO TO LIFT UP ALL WOMEN. AND GIVEN US A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY. THE COVER NINETEEN CRISIS AS BETTER SECTORS IN WHICH WOMEN'S EMPLOYMENT IS MORE CONCENTRATED. THE SET THOSE UP CLOSE ON DAYCARE CENTERS SCHOOLS KEEPING CHILDREN AT HOME AND MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS. SPECIALLY FOR MOTHERS WHO TEND TO BE THE PRIMARY CARRIERS KEEP WORKING. THESE BURDENS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT THE LONGER WOMEN OF COLOR. DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EMPLOYMENT FOR BLACK AND LATINA WOMEN FILE FELL BY 20% MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE KLEIN AN EMPLOYMENT FOR WHITE WOMEN AND MORE THAN THREE TIMES OF THE CLAIM FOR WHITE MEN. WOMEN'S WORKPLACE EQUALITY WILL HAVE. BEEN SET BACK DECADES BY THE CRISIS. WELL AS WE ESTATE LEADERS COME TOGETHER AND INTERVENE TO AVERT IT. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE IMPORTANT TIME FOR LEADERSHIP DURING THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. TODAY WE CELEBRATE WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH AND WE MUST CELEBRATED EVERY YEAR TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THEIR HISTORICAL ROLE IN ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE TRAILBLAZING WOMEN THAT CAME BEFORE US. AND THOSE THAT WILL COME AFTER US. TODAY WE CELEBRATE AMAZING WOMEN FROM EACH ASSEMBLY AND SENATE DISTRICTS ARE WORKING DAY IN AND DAY OUT. TO ME THE COMMUNITIES AND OUR GOLDEN STATE BETTER. IN BIG AND SMALL WAYS NOTICED AND UNNOTICED. LEADERS LIKE OUR HONOREES HAVE INSPIRED AND CHANGE OUR COMMUNITIES FOR THE BETTER. AND GET THIS GOING THROUGH AND KEPT US GOING THERE IN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TIMES. IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT WE DECIDED THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE THIS RECOGNITION THIS YEAR OTHER CELEBRATIONS LOOK DIFFERENT THAN PAST YEARS. THE CERTIFICATES ARE HONOREES WILL RECEIVE THE PICK THE ARTWORK OF A BOOK BY SAID IN A SONG AND I CALLED. HOW WE WON THE VOTE IN THE IN NINETEEN ELEVEN.

THIS COME TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE ALL OF OUR HONOREES THE TROUBLE IS THE RAISING WOMEN IN THE PAST THE HISTORY MAKING WOMEN THAT SERVE WITH US TODAY AND THEY FEATURE WOMEN WHO WILL CONTINUE TO CATAPULT OUR STATE OF SOCIETY FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY SIX AND WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH. JEWISH WOMEN HAVE BEEN AT THE CENTRE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR CENTURIES FOLLOWING THE JEWISH TEACHINGS THAT JUSTICE MERCY AND GOODNESS ARE NOT TO BE HELD IN A VACUUM BUT PRACTICE IN OUR DAILY LIVES. WE HAVE STOOD COURAGEOUSLY AT THE FOREFRONT OF A WIDE RANGE PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS CAUSES INCLUDING WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE LABOUR REFORM CIVIL RIGHTS SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT LITERATURE AND HEALTH CARE. WE CAN COUNT AMONG THEIR RANKS LEADERS IN EVERY FIELD INCLUDING GERTRUDE ELION WHO DEVELOPED THE FIRST TREATMENT FOR CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA AN ANTI VIRAL MEDICATION AND THE LAZARUS A SUCCESSFUL AUTHOR AND POET WHOSE WORDS GIVE ME YOUR TIRED YOUR POOR YOUR HUDDLED MASSES YEARNING TO BE FREE. ARE DISPLAYED ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. AND WELCOMING- KNOWN TO WELCOME NEWCOMERS TO AMERICA FROM AROUND THE WORLD. ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES BILL US BUG OR BATTLING BELLA WHO SERVED THREE TERMS IN CONGRESS AND ADVOCATED FOR GROUND BREAKING BILLS INCLUDING EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT ENTITLE NINE. AND OF COURSE JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG AND IKONEN ARDENT DEFENDER OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE ON THE SUPREME COURT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION JEWISH WOMEN HAVE NEVER STOOD IDLY BY AGAINST OPPRESSION OR pFORWARD TO A TIME WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO CELEBRATE WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH WHEN THE STORIES OF WOMEN AND OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS IT'S SO MUCH A PART OF OUR LEXICON AND TAUGHT ON EQUAL FOOTING. AND RECOGNIZED ALONGSIDE THAT OF OUR BROTHERS I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN WE WHEN WOMEN'S HISTORY. IS RECOGNIZED SIMPLY AS HUMAN HISTORY. THAT WON'T HAPPEN THOUGH UNTIL WE HAVE A TIME WHEN WOMEN IN GOVERNMENT WHEN WOMEN IN BUSINESS WOMEN IN THE ARTS WHEN WOMEN IN POWER IN OUR SOCIETY. A PARITY WITH MEN. RATHER THAN HAVING ONE MONTH RECOGNIZING THAT GOAL THAT'LL BE REALIZE ALL YEAR. THAT'S WHEN WE KNOW THAT REAL JUSTICE AND REALLY QUALITY HAS OCCURRED. AS THE DAUGHTER OF A STRONG JEWISH WOMAN AND THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A VERY STRONG JEWISH BOOK WHO TOOK WITH ME DOOR TOOK ME DOOR TO DOOR TO ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS WHEN I WAS A CHILD IN FLORIDA. AND IS A PROUD JEWISH WOMAN MYSELF I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON HR TWENTY SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN MISS BURKE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I RISE TO SUPPORT HR TWENTY SIX RELATIVE TO WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH. WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DID NOT MENTION DURING TODAY'S CELEBRATION THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF BLACK WOMEN IN OUR STATE. BLACK WOMEN HAVE SHATTERED GLASS CEILINGS FOR YEARS WORKING TEN TIMES HARDER AS THEIR COUNTERPARTS WITH VERY LITTLE RECOGNITION. AND IT'S TIME FOR THAT TO CHANGE. FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO MY MOM WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN% ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE. AND ACHIEVEMENT THAT AT THE TIME WAS NOTHING SHORT OF EXTRAORDINARY. IN OUR TIME HERE SHE BECAME ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE WHACK MARKETS WHICH I AM A PROUD MEMBER. SINCE THEN WE HAVE SEEN MANY BLACK WOMEN ACHIEVE MANY NEW BOLD HEIGHTS. AMONG MANY NOTABLE WOMEN WE'VE HAD KAREN BASS WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORY TO SERVE AS SPEAKER. AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE. SUE PARKER THE FIRST WOMAN TO SERVE AS THE CHIEF PART OF THIS ASSEMBLY. AND DR SHIRLEY WEBER THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO SERVE AS A CALIFORNIA STATE SECRETARY OF STATE. HOWEVER I MUST SAY IT'S NOT SIMPLY ENOUGH TO CELEBRATE THE WINS. IF WE TRULY BELIEVE IN EQUALITY. AND EQUITY WE MUST ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSURING THAT WHEN ONE WOMAN A SENSE IT DOESN'T EVEN EMPTY SEATS ARE SILENCE THE VOICES OF HALF OUR STATE POPULATION. THE QUESTION IS NO LONGER CAN WE LEAVE OR SHOULD WE LEAVE. BUT HOW WILL EACH OF YOU MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR CONTINUE TO OCCUPY THE SEATS AROUND. IF WE DO THIS I BELIEVE WILL BE INSPIRING GENERATIONS TO REACH THEIR TRUE POTENTIAL. FREE OF ANY SOCIETY BARRIERS AND STANDARDS. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WOMEN WERE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE BUT THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY IT'S NOT OVER. THE STRUGGLES OF WOMEN THE RESOLVING THE MIGHT SHOWN BY WOMEN IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY WE WILL HAVE BEEN IN PAIN IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES WOMEN FACE TODAY. MORE MUST BE DONE TO SUPPORT WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR LOOKING. STATION ACROSS ALL LEVELS. AS WE HONOR AND CELEBRATE WOMEN TODAY. LET US REMEMBER TO CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON THE LEGACY OF MANY WOMEN THAT HAVE FOUGHT FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES. THAT WE ALL BENEFIT FROM TODAY. THANK YOU MISS BURKE CERVANTES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LGBTQ CAUCUS I PROBABLY RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY SIX. AS A MEMBER OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THERE'S NO DENYING THAT LESBIAN BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER WOMEN HAVE MADE NUMEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS IN OUR SOCIETY. IN CALIFORNIA FIVE POINT 4% OF THE FEMALE POPULATION IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. AS A STATE WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN MOVING AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL MALE FEMALE FEMALE BINARY GENDER NORMS AND RECOGNIZING SEXUAL IDENTITY AS A FLUID CONTRIBUTOR TO LIVING FREELY AND AUTHENTICALLY. WE ARE DAUGHTERS WE ARE MOTHERS WE ARE FRIENDS AND WE ARE ALLIES IN OUR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES AND THE CELEBRATION OF WOMANHOOD HAS SHOWN US THAT EVERY WOMAN HAS INCREDIBLE POWER. WE MUST CONTINUE TO HONOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WE ARE WOMEN WHO HAVE IGNITED CHANGE THROUGH ACTIVISM THROUGH LEADERSHIP EVEN IN THE FACE OF SEXISM. AND ANTI LGBTQ RHETORIC SADLY THERE IS STILL AN EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE ATTACKING TRANSGENDER WOMEN ESPECIALLY ARE TRANSGENDER WOMEN OF COLOR. IF FALLS UPON EACH OF US. EACH OF US TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF OUR TRANSGENDER SISTERS AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS THE SAME ACCESS THE SAME PRIVILEGE THAT WE ALL DO.

THIS BODY RECENTLY PASSED THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS COVERED NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES KEEP CALIFORNIANS WORKING IN ONE OF THE MOST DAUNTING AND CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES THEY FACE IN THEIR LIFETIMES. OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE TOLD US. THAT WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST HELPFUL TO THEM IT'S A PUT A PAUSE ON IMPOSING MORE COSTS AND BURDENS ON THEM BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO OPEN UP. REHIRE AND RECOVER. BUT THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE BY IMPOSING EVEN MORE REQUIREMENTS ON BUSINESSES EXPOSING THEM TO EVEN MORE LIABILITY. WITH SMALL BUSINESSES SIMPLY TRYING TO SURVIVE THIS IS ANOTHER BLOW THEY WILL TRY TO ENSURE PILING ON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO IN FACT POWER OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES WILL ONLY STAND IN THE WAY OF OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND HERE WE ARE WITH THOUSANDS OF CLOSE BUSINESSES IN OUR STATE MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED YES SACRAMENTO IS YET PUMMELING OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH MORE RESTRICTIONS AND BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS ON BUSINESSES THAT HAVE PERSEVERED TO THIS PANDEMIC I URGE A NO VOTE ON SB NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU MR FONG MYSTERY ARE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. MMHM THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY WHO PRO ACTIVELY REACHED OUT AND WANTED TO WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WE HAVE ENGAGED IN DIALOGUE ASK QUESTIONS DISAGREED COME TO AGREEMENT SEARCH FOR ANSWERS AND ULTIMATELY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND A COMPROMISE. THEY SAY THAT WHEN LEGISLATION MOVES FORWARD AND NO ONE PARTY IS 1100% HAPPY THEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHAT COMPROMISE LOOKS LIKE. IT HAS BEEN AN EXPERIENCE TO SAY THE LEAST AND ONE THAT I THINK WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE CAN ALL SUPPORT. AS WE ENTER THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE CULVERT NINETEEN GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND THE SHUTDOWN THAT HAS UPENDED OUR LIVES WE ALL NEED TIME TO REFLECT. AS WELL AS MOVE FORWARD TOWARD THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THAT IS INCLUSIVE EQUITABLE AND TRANSPARENT. THAT INCLUDES INSURING THAT THE GOLDEN STIMULUS THAT HAS. THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED IN THIS BODY IS SUCCESSFUL. AND THAT WE ALSO PROTECT THE EMPLOYEES WHICH MAKES SMALL BUSINESSES FUNCTION ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND REALLY ACROSS THIS NATION WE ALL KNOW AND AGREE. THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY I HAVE BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE FACING SHUTDOWNS THAT ARE FACING SHUTDOWNS BECAUSE OF GENTRIFICATION THAT ARE FACING SHUTDOWNS. BECAUSE OF HIGH RENTS IN COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY PROTECTIONS AT THE MOMENT THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT IS TO HAVE THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES FAILED. BUT WE CANNOT DO SO IF WE ALSO DON'T PROTECT THE WORKERS THE EMPLOYEES FROM OUR COMMUNITY THAT MAKE THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES WORK. EVERY SINGLE DAY ONE PERSON GETTING COVERED AND BRINGING COLD INTO THE WORKPLACE IS A ONE PERSON TOO MANY IMPACTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR COWORKERS AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF THE CUSTOMERS OF THAT SMALL BUSINESS. WELL MANY CALIFORNIANS WERE ABLE TO STAY HOME AND QUARANTINE. AND ORDER GROCERIES ONLINE LET US REMEMBER THAT THOSE GROCERIES WERE PICKED UP AND DELIVERED BY A REAL HUMAN BEING. THE GROCERY STORE WAS STOCKED AND CLEANED BY A REAL HUMAN BEING. THE GROCERIES WERE BROUGHT TO THAT STORE THROUGH A TRUCK BY A REAL HUMAN BEING. FOOD WAS PICKED UP AND PACKAGED BY A REAL HUMAN BEING THESE ARE REAL HUMAN LIVES HUMANS WHO HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL. AND YOU HAVE SHOWN US WHAT MANY OF US ALREADY KNEW WHEN IT COMES TO BE ECONOMIC INEQUITIES OF THIS COUNTRY AND OUR STATE. OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IS DRIVEN BY HARD WORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE FOR THE PAST YEAR WRISTER LIVES WELL WE SURVIVED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. BUT WHEN THE INEVITABLE HAPPENS AND A WORKER CONTRACTS SILVA NINETEEN. WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THAT CHOICE BETWEEN A PAYCHECK. AND RISKING THE HEALTH OF THEIR COWORKERS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS ISN'T THE CHOICE CALIFORNIA NEED SUPPLEMENTAL COVERED NINETEEN PAPERS THAT SICK LEAVE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES TAX CREDITS FOR SMALL AND MIDSIZE BUSINESSES THAT VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE SICK LEAVE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES BUT ONCE AGAIN. WE MUST ACT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FALLS SHORT SB NINETY FIVE. DOES EXEMPTS. BUSINESSES THAT ARE SMALLER THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES AND UNDER AND I URGE ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES WITH TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER KNOW THAT THEY CAN STILL PROVIDE THIS INCREDIBLE AND NECESSARY BENEFITS TO THEIR WORKERS WITH THE STIMULUS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND I REALLY DO HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU THAT SAY YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR SMALL BUSINESSES. WORK WITHIN THIS BODY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER LET ME SAY IT AGAIN TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER WHO WE ARE ACCEPTING. HAVE ACCESS AND KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCES TO LET THEIR EMPLOYEES KNOW THAT THEY CAN STILL RECEIVE THE PAID LEAVE BASED ON WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY DOING. I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS AND SAY REQUIRING PAID SICK LEAVE FOR WORKERS WILL HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD AND SAVE LIVES MORE THAN HALF A MILLION AMERICANS HAVE LOST. HALF A MILLION AMERICANS HAVE A MILLION AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONE SECOND WE CANNOT WAIT WE HAVE TO ACT TODAY AND WE MUST ENSURE. THAT MORE LIVES ARE LOST AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE FOR SB NINETY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISCREANT MISTER SMITH YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. AS A FRESHMAN TO THIS LEGISLATOR IN A RETIRED BUSINESS OWNER. I STAND OPPOSED TO S. B. NINETY FIVE. THERE'S OVER FORTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE'S THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL TO. REPRESENTING HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE MAKING A POLICY CHANGE THROUGH A BUDGET BILL. THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. WE COULD HAVE AN EMERGENCY BILL BE MORE TRANSPARENT TO THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA GIVE THEM MORE TIME FOR INPUT. SO THEIR VOICES HEARD IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE ALL HEARD THE SAYING BEFORE. I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP. WHAT BUSINESSES NEED TO CALIFORNIA THE FORMER GOVERNMENT TO QUIT TRYING TO HELP. BECAUSE ALL WE DO IS KEEP MAKING IT WORSE I STAND OPPOSED TO IT SB NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH. THIS RESCUE WERE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHTY FOUR SB NINETY FIVE AS THIS MEASURE IS A BALANCED APPROACH TO PROTECT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENSURE OUR CENTRAL WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIA DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL PAID SICK LEAVE BENEFITS. EMPLOYERS SHOULD NOT FEEL AS THOUGH THEIR ABILITY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE OR PAID FOR A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD THAT IS RELIANT ON THEM IGNORING PUBLIC HEALTH. AND SAFETY ORDERS. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN SIGNED BY PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL REIMBURSE. CUPBOARD EMPLOYERS FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING SICK LEAVE. WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR CENTRAL WORKERS AND MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN. CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING AT US AND DEPENDING ON OUR COMPASSION AND OUR COMMON SENSE TO ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. LET'S SHOW THEM WE WILL FIGHT FOR THEM I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU MISS RASMUSSEN COLLEGE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I HAVE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES CAN YOU IMAGINE CAN YOU IMAGINE US HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO PASS A POLICY THAT WILL LITERALLY SAVE THE LIVES OF WORKERS IN OUR DISTRICT. SAVE THE LIVES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TAKING THE TIME OFF IF THEY'RE COVERED POSITIVE AND PAYING THE BILLS IT WILL ULTIMATELY SAVE THE LIVES OF THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY DON'T COME THEY DON'T SPREAD IT THROUGHOUT THE SMALL BUSINESSES. AND ON TOP OF THAT IT'S ALL PAID FOR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THESE BUSINESSES THAT ARE PROVIDING THE SICK LEAVE WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO HAVE IT RECOUPED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE CAN SAVE LIVES IN THIS IS. YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT TIME AND PROCESS WE DON'T LIKE THE GOVERNOR TO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SO WE'RE PUTTING THROUGH A PROCESS BUT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH MORE TIME. DESPITE THE VACCINES DESPITE THE SLOW THE SPREAD PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STILL TIENE. WORKERS THAT HAVE NO PROTECTIONS ARE STILL GOING TO WORK SICK. THIS WILL PREVENT THAT THIS WILL SAVE LIVES AT ZERO COST TO OUR BUSINESSES. IT IS A WIN WIN. WE HEARD YOUR CALLS ABOUT WORRYING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES. IN TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER ARE TAKEN OUT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY TOOL. CAN GET A TAX REFUND OR TAX CREDIT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES. TO ACCESS THIS VERY IMPORTANT PROCESS THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT WE SHOULD DEMAND. THAT THOSE THAT CAN DO PROVIDE IT. I SAY TODAY THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT A BUSINESS WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE TAX CREDIT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT'S TIME TO SAVE LIVES. I IMPLORE YOU ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN MY DISTRICT. IN MISCREANTS DESPITE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA. MY OTHER COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES AS WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING THEM DYING BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO GO TO WORK I IMPLORE YOU TO DO. SOME RELIEF FOR THOSE WORKERS WE HAVE CALLED THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. DO THIS ONE SMALL THING TO ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND GO HOME SAFELY WHEN THEY ARE SICK. AYE ASPIRIN AYE ABOUT. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I RISE TODAY IN OPPOSITION OF F. B. NINETY FIVE ONE YEAR AND TWO DAYS AGO MANY OF THE BUSINESSES IN MY COMMUNITY CLOSE THEIR DOORS TO DO THEIR PART AND FLATTENING THE CURVE AND FIGHTING THIS PANDEMIC I'M REMINDED OF THE LATINO OWN BUSINESS OF MY COMMUNITY THEY MAKE JERSEYS FOR ATHLETIC TEAMS IN OUR COMMUNITY. THEY CLOSE THEIR DOORSBUT QUICKLY PIVOTED TO MAKING MASK AND FLOOR DECALS TO HELP OTHER ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES MARKED THE GROUND FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING OTHER BUSINESSES HAD TO FURLOUGH EMPLOYEES BUT KEPT PAYING FOR THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE THERE ARE SO THEIR EMPLOYEES WERE NOT WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. SOME COMPANIES CLOSE ONE YEAR AGO AND THEY HAVE YET TO OPEN THEIR DOORS LIKE SIX FLAGS MAGIC MOUNTAIN AND DODGER STADIUM THAT HAVE OPENED THEIR SITES TO HELP ADMINISTER VACCINES SO MANY BUSINESSES ALONGSIDE THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE DURING THIS PANDEMIC FOR THE DAY CARE PROVIDER WITH ONE EMPLOYEE TO THE FILTRATION COMPANY WITH FORTY EMPLOYEES TO OUR THEME PARKS AND SPORTS VENUES. WITH THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES THEY'RE ALL AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FABRIC THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA A WONDERFUL PLACE TO LIVE AND DO BUSINESS WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THEM AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY LET'S REWARD THEIR COMMITMENT NOT PENALIZE THEM BY OPENING UP THEM UP TO LAWSUITS TO THE RETROACTIVE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL BUSINESSES ARE FRAUD TRIAL AND THIS BILL WILL KILL BUSINESSES AND JOBS. I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY FIVE. MANY BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT. OUR SIDEWALK VENDORS THE SIDEWALK VENDORS PROBABLY ARE THE ONES THAT EMPLOY THE MOST PEOPLE N. A. D. FIFTY NINE. EIGHTY FIFTY NINE ALSO HAS UNIVERSITY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MY ALMA MATER. THIS BILL IS NOT FOR THAT LARGE UNIVERSITY IS ACTUALLY FOR. INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. THAT EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY THEY HAVE TO SUPPORT NOT ONLY THEIR BUSINESS BUT THE FAMILIES THAT THE EMPLOYEE. THE MOST IMPORTANT THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD LOBBYIST TO COME UP HERE TO SACRAMENTO THEY DON'T HAVE. LARGE ACCOUNTANTS DON'T HAVE ATTORNEYS THAT CAN FIGHT FOR THEM WITH THE IRS THEY'RE JUST VERY SMALL BEGINNING. BUSINESSES MOSTLY LATINO BUSINESSES. FOR WHICH THIS BILL WILL ACTUALLY HELP BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN CARVED OUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE IMPACTED BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS. YOU'RE NOT IMPACTED SO WHEN I HEAR. THAT THIS WILL HURT SMALL BUSINESSES. I HAVE SMALL BUSINESSES WHEN YOU'RE ONE OR TWO. A TWENTY FIVE PLEASE LESS THAT'S A SMALL BUSINESS. IN THIS BILL WILL HELP MAKE SURE THAT THE EMPLOYEES ARE KEPT SAFE THEY COULD STAY AND CN DO THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO BUT MOST IMPORTANT THEY'RE NOT ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THIS BILL SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER JOHN SORRY MR CALL ARE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT HAS SPOKEN IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY FIVE. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON COMMENTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. REGARDING THE FACT THAT THIS REALLY IS ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH FOR SO MANY. IN OUR STATE. AND THAT CANNOT- IN THAT THAT THAT THAT YOU CAN GET THAT BACK YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF RESOURCES COMING IN FEDERAL BRING A LOT OF RESOURCES IN THE STATE- TO TRY TO HELP ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES SMALL MEDIUM LARGE STAY IN BUSINESS WILL BE CAN'T GET BACK ON THE LIVES LOST JUST OVER THE WEEKEND THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ABOUT. LATINO COMMUNITY IN THE BAY AREA AND HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES. AND THAT AS WE WERE RE OPENING. LAST SPRING LOS AFTER LAST SUMMER RE OPENING INTO THE FALL. THE RE OPENING BENEFITTED THOSE THAT WERE ABLE. TO WORK FROM HOME IT WAS BENEFITING THOSE WHO RE ABLE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE IT WAS NOT BENEFITING THOSE THAT LIVED. WITH MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS AND A HOME IT WAS NOT BENEFITING THOSE THAT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO TO WORK. OR THEY WOULD GET FIRED DIDN'T GET. SICK DAYS. AND SO. AS THE VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY. THERE'S NO DOUBT THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING LET'S NOT FORGET THAT IS THOSE WORKERS THAT WORK FOR THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE LITERALLY PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE THE DATA HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR LET'S GET BEYOND THE DATA TO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE LOST THEIR LOVED ONES JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD TO GO TO WORK AND HAD NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. WITHOUT ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB NINETY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MR MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER YOU KNOW WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION EARLIER THIS MORNING IN THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. AND WE LOOK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF WORKERS WHO DIED BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE IN THE WORKPLACE YOU THINK OF LARGE- POULTRY MANUFACTURERS- THE GARMENT INDUSTRY IN INDIA IN LOS ANGELES A FARMWORKERS IN THE FIELD. BUT MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS COME FROM SMALL BUSINESSES THAT YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT IN THE NEWS BECAUSE THEY EMPLOY HUNDREDS OR- MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OR A THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM THESE LOCATIONS THESE ARE SMALL ENTITIES. AND AMID AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY THIS BILL DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH I RE I REMIND PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THIS AND WHO WERE OPPOSED TO LAST YEAR'S BILL. ON EXTENDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE- THAT THRESHOLD WITH FIVE OR FEWER EMPLOYEES WHO WHO WEREN'T- WHO WEREN'T OBLIGATED TO FOCUS ON THIS THIS IS TWENTY FIVE OR MORE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT SAY THAT THIS DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. THEY WOULD WANT TO GO DOWN FROM 222-215-2102 FIVE TO ONE BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYEE. THAT SIX THAT'S EXPOSED TO COVER NINETEEN AND IS FORCED TO GO TO WORK THEY'RE PUTTING THEMSELVES IN THE COMMUNITY AND LEE AT RISK SO I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE. THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE I APPLIED MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WHO WORKED ON THE AMENDMENTS AS CHAIR THE BUDGET SUB COMMUNITY REFORM STATE ADMINISTRATION. FOR FINDING A FAIR NUMBER IN THERE. BUT TWO OTHER THINGS I THINK CAN'T GO IGNORED- ONE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC IT'S WINDING DOWN THE VACCINES ARE ROLLING OUT- BY THE BY THE FIRST OF MAY EVERY ADULT IN AMERICA. IS GOING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE A VACCINE. CLINIC HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. SO WE KNOW THAT THE END IS NEAR THIS HAS A SUNSET OF SEVERAL MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER. AND THEN LASTLY- THE CERTAINLY THIS IS MONEY THAT'S ARE REFUNDABLE AS OUR MAJORITY LEADER ALLUDED TO WITH- MONIES IN THIS THIRD ROUND OF STIMULUS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO- THE DIFF BURDEN ON BUSINESSES IT IS AGAIN. MITIGATED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS- FUNDED SO I THINK THIS WAS A FAIR FAIR COMPROMISE. IS TIME TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE SUPPORT OUR WORKERS BUT ALSO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH. WHICH IS WHY THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE FOR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY MISTER LEE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY FIVE BECAUSE FRANKLY. ALMOST A YEAR AGO WHEN THIS PANDEMIC STARTED WHAT WAS THE TERM THAT WE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;G FOR GROCERY WORKERS&lt;/c&gt;</u> ARE FOOD SERVICE WORKERS AND EVERYONE THAT MADE SERVICE ECONOMY AND ARE COMING FRANKLY WORK. ASCENTIAL WORKERS ASCENTIAL. IF WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THEM PAID SICK LEAVE WE ARE MAKING WORKERS CHOOSE BETWEEN GETTING COVERED NINETEEN OR THEIR PAYCHECK. CHOOSE BETWEEN HAVING BEING ABLE TO PAY THEIR RENT OR PERHAPS GETTING A DEADLY VIRUS. I HEAR FROM MY CONSTITUENTS ALL THE TIME IT COMES OF COMES TO MIND IS THERE WAS A BAKERY IN MY DISTRICT. WHERE THERE WAS A WORKER. WHO'S AFRAID TO GET TESTED. THEY WERE VERY IRRESPONSIBLE BUT THEY'RE AFRAID TO GET TESTED BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO MISS WORK AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED VERY PREDICTABLE. THEY CAME TO WORK AND EVICTED EVERYONE SOME PEOPLE OUT SHE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND THAT BUSINESS HAD TO SHUT DOWN FOR WEEKS FOR WEEKS. AND THAT IS INCOME THAT HURTS THE FAMILY SMALL BUSINESS BUT THEY ARE TAKING MORE PRECAUTIONS THAN EVER AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE THEIR EMPLOYEES MAKE THAT CHOICE BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. YOU'D RATHER. IT RATHER CHOOSE YOUR YOUR IMMINENT SURVIVAL. THAN AND ROLL THE DICE ON A ON A VIRUS AND THAT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD BE TO HELP COULD BE. I HAVE WORKERS IN MY DISTRICT WHO WORK AT RETAIL MALLS AND RETAIL SHOPS. THAT ARE UPHOLD EARLIER DURING THE SURGE WHEN WE RAISE THE CAPACITIES AND THEY WERE AFRAID TO GET TESTED. BECAUSE THOSE WORKERS WHO WORK AT THE RESTAURANTS AND WORK AT STORES ARE THE ONES WHO CYCLE AND SEE LOTS OF CUSTOMERS AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO POTENTIALLY. COULD GET CALVET. AND YET THE SAME TIME EVEN THOUGH THE EXPOSURE IS HIGH AND THEY KNOW IT THEY'RE FREE TO GET TESTED. BE SIMPLY THERE WAS NO SOCIAL SAFETY NET FOR THESE PEOPLE THERE WAS NO PAID SICK LEAVE. AND I'M- FRANKLY YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT WE HEAR FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE IN SACRAMENTO MENTIONED THAT THERE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WANT TO SEE THIS GO DOWN FURTHER FROM TWENTY FIVE. TO TWENTY FOUR PERHAPS THE. 232-221-2019. EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN FIFTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THIRTY. LOWER AMOUNTS SO THAT PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY BE COVERED. LOWER SMALL BUSINESSES AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE. TO BE COVERED. BY BASICALLY. EVERYONE BUT I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE A FAIR. PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF FAIR BILL THAT'S A GOOD COMPROMISE AND ADDS OUR COLLEAGUES POINTED OUT WE HAVE A PARTNER IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW. THAT WILL HELP REIMBURSE AND SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES AND PROTECT WORKERS AT SAME TIME IT'S QUITE TRANSFORMATIVE NOW TO HAVE A- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT ACTUALLY PARTNERS WITH US AND HELPS US WITH WORKING CALIFORNIANS. AND WE SHOULD BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND CLEVERLY PUTTING TOGETHER LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. SO REALLY AREN'T YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS FOR ALL THE WORKING CLASS CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST IN. THE BAY AREA BUT ALSO OF COURSE ALL THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA AND WE REALLY NEED TO BE PASSING SICK LEAVE. NOW THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MYSTERY MR SANTIAGO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MAY I SPEAK I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY FIVE. NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO BE THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE HUMANE THING TO DO. THINK ABOUT IT NOT EVERYBODY WAS LUCKY ENOUGH. TO STAY AT HOME AND WORK FROM HOME. NOT NOT EVERY CAN OAK UP. A COMPUTER AT HOME. WE TELL YOU ABOUT THIS PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT OPEN UP A COMPUTER AT HOME. AND WORK FROM HOME. THEY WERE THAT THEY WERE THE FRONT LINE WORKERS AT THE GROCERY STORE. THERE WERE ARE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THERE WERE PEOPLE OF FAST FOOD PEOPLE AT BANKS. PEOPLE WHO KEPT CALIFORNIA GOING THE REST OF US WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME. THIS BILL IS ABOUT EQUITY AND FAIRNESS. FOR THOSE WHO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. I'M GONNA SAY THAT AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE. IN OUR COMMUNITIES- KEPT CALIFORNIA GOING. AND PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IT'S THE HUMANE THING TO DO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME LAST YEAR. TALKING ABOUT EQUITY. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. FIGHTING FOR EQUITY. THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO BRING SOME OF THAT EQUITY HOME. BECAUSE FRONT LINE WORKERS LITERALLY ARE PUTTING THEIR JOBS ON THE LINE. AND WHAT'S MORE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE EXEMPTED. SO THAT ARGUMENT. FOR MOST OF US WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IMPACT OUR MOMS BUT A MOM AND POP BUSINESSES NO LONGER THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MULTI MILLION DOLLAR BUSINESSES HERE. AND WHAT'S MORE IS THAT COULD BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOW WE SEE THE NUMBERS ARE DECLINING ABETTING AND QUANTIFIERS THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT WHERE THERE'S VALUES THERE'S PEAKS AND THE PEAKS ARE IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHERE FOLKS HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK. I ASK EACH ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES TO TAKE A VOTE. VOTE YES. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THOSE PEOPLE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WHO ARE JANITORS WHO CLEAN OUR HOMES. WILL GIVE US FAST FOOD OR GROCERY WORKERS THE BUS DRIVERS HEALTH CARE WORKERS. AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO'S PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE. IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO EXAGGERATE THE SAY THE PEOPLE COULD DIE WHEN THEY GO TO WORK BECAUSE THE EXACTLY WHAT COULD HAPPEN. SOME PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WERE. WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WORK FROM HOME. OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS WERE NOT AND WE'RE JUST ASKING. TO BRING EQUITY HOME ON THIS AND ALLOW THEM. TO BE HOME WHEN COLBERT HITS. THEIR HOUSEHOLD. I WOULD THAT I ASK YOU FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO MISTER WARD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND SB NINETY FIVE ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO CONSIDER GIVING IT THEIR SUPPORT HERE TODAY AND WHILE MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD OVER THE LAST YEAR AND HOW THE IMPACTS OF. OFFERING PAID SICK LEAVE MIGHT IMPACT BUSINESS AS WE KNOW FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT ALL OF THEIR WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT THE PAYROLL WHO HAVE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE TO STAY HOME TO AVOID. THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS HAVE RESULTED IN NET POSITIVE ECONOMIC INTO THEIR COUNTRIES A NET POSITIVE HEALTH IMPACTS TO THEIR CITIZENRY AND WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING MEASURES LIKE THIS FOR MUCH OF THE SAME REASONS BECAUSE THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT AT THIS ELEVENTH HOUR IS THE FOURTH SURGE WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING THIS IS FOUND MONEY THIS IS MONEY NOW THANKFULLY COMING TO US. FROM THE LATEST AMULETS THAT WE CAN PUT RIGHT BACK OUT INTO OUR COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THESE KINDS OF RIGHT THINGS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING ALL ALONG EVERY TIME WE FOUND A NICKEL EVERY TIME WE FOUND A RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT OUT THERE AND HELP THE WORKERS. SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE GOING TO ENDANGER THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILY THEIR NEIGHBORS THEIR LOVED ONES THEIR COWORKERS THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY THIS IS A COMMON SENSE A NO BRAINER OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AND DO THE RIGHT THING TO GET US OVER THE LAST. COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT WE HAVE AHEAD AND MAKE SURE THAT IN ANYWHERE IN OUR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR DISTRICTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY OUTBREAKS THIS BILL ALSO ALLOWS WORKERS WHO MIGHT BE SUFFERING SOME OF THE EFFECTS OR HAVE A DAY OR TWO OF THE EFFECTS FROM GETTING A VACCINE. TO BE ABLE TO USE PAID SICK LEAVE WE WANT PEOPLE WE KNOW THAT THE MESSAGES OUT THERE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA HAVE THE SAME REACTION AS MANY HUMAN BEINGS DUE TO GETTING THE VACCINE BUT WE WANT THEM TO GET VACCINATED THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ANY OF THESE HEALTHCARE NEEDS. AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE A PAYCHECK SO I ASK YOU WHERE EVER YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE SPECTRUM. THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. AND THE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE ECONOMY AND THE RIGHT OF HEALTH. THE HEALTHY A COMMUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING TO EMPLOY THIS MONEY RIGHT BACK ON TO OUR COMMUNITY TO PAY THE WORKERS- THE SICKLY THAT THEY ARE DUE. TO HELP SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY SO WE DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER OUTBREAK. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TRANSITIONING ON ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. INTO SPACES THAT ARE HEALTHY THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY VIBRANT- AND THAT ARE SUPPORTING THE FAMILIES OF THE WORKERS. WITH THE INCOME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THESE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS I ASK FOR YOUR STRONG AYE VOTE ON SB NINETY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. MISTER BENNETT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WE'VE WE ARE HEARING THIS AFTERNOON MANY COMPELLING REASONS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT. AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THOSE OF US THAT ARE IN GOVERNMENT TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT AND GROW PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT. SO WE HAVE A CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF US WE HAVE AN EXPIRY DEADLINE AND WE NEEDED TO TAKE ACTION. AND I HAVE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED AS A NEW MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO COME HERE. AND WATCH THE ASSEMBLY. STRUGGLE WITH ALL OF THE COMPLICATING ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN HOW DO YOU DO THIS WHAT THE RULES WILL BE. WHETHER BUSINESSES WILL BE REIMBURSED WHICH BUSINESSES SHOULD BE REIMBURSED IS THAT COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHAT'S THE TIMING. AND WEEK AFTER WEEK THIS BILL MODIFIED AND SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LEGISLATION BEING LOOKING LIKE SAUSAGE COMING TOGETHER BUT I WOULD OFFER TO USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE LEGISLATURE COMING TOGETHER WITH THE BILL THAT DOES ONE ESSENTIAL THING. AND THAT IS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF BOTH THE EMPLOYEES OF A BUSINESS THAT MAY HAVE COVERED MAY BE EXPOSED TO COVERT. AND THE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS THEY'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH FOR THE LAST YEAR AND NOW HAVE. AN EXTENSION OF A OF THE DEADLINE LIKE THIS WE HAVE COME TOGETHER I'M NOT IN THE AUTHORS OF THIS BILL OF COME TOGETHER. WITH SOMETHING THAT REINFORCES THOSE PEOPLE WHO OPERATE WITH GOOD FAITH. IT PROTECTS PEOPLE IF THEY MAKE A GOOD FACE AIR. THEY DON'T HAVE A LAWSUIT THROWN ADAM RIGHT AWAY THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THAT THIS IS GOING TO STOP THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR THE LEVERAGE IN THE PRESSURE THEY MAY HAVE ON THEIR EMPLOYEES. WITHOUT BEING PUNITIVE AND SO IT'S NOT THERE YOU NEVER CAN WRITE A BILL THAT EVERYBODY LIKES OR THAT YOU CAN DEFINE AS PERFECT BUT TODAY I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT BILL THAT REINFORCES GOOD FAITH BEHAVIOR AND ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT. THE LEGISLATURE CAN COME TOGETHER AND WORK AS THE KINKS IN THE PROBLEMS THE BILL SO I SUPPORT A IVOTA THIS THING YOU VERY MUCH MANAGE. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT THIS RECIPE YOU ARE A- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'VE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY FIVE. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO EARLIER MADE THE COMMENT THAT. WE SHOULD BE PAYING. OUR WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO STAY AT HOME DURING A PANDEMIC. WE SHOULD BE PAYING THEM TO STAY AT HOME TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET VACCINES. I DO WANT TO SAY HOWEVER THAT THE- I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE GOVERNMENT BEST SHOULD BE PAYING TO KEEP THE TO INCENTIVIZE THE WORKERS TO STAY AT HOME AND NOT THE SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT IS WHY I EXPRESSED EARLY CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS BILL ON SMALL BUSINESSES YOU KNOW I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT THE- PROJECTIONS ARE SHOWING THAT MAYBE UP 240% OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES MAY NOT SURVIVE THIS PANDEMIC. AND LET ME REMIND MY COLLEAGUES MY ESPECIALLY MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES THAT ONE SMALL BUSINESSES GO UNDER THOSE JOBS ARE GONE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VERY REAL CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER THESE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE COMING BACK. AND SO WHEN WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A JOB TO COME BACK TO. SO YOU KNOW. I AGREE WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS. A COMPROMISE IT'S A COMPROMISE. GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE DO WANT TO PAY WORKERS WE DO WANT INCENTIVIZE WORKERS. TO STAY AT HOME DURING A PANDEMIC AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY I'M SUPPORTING THIS. ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE. THE EXEMPTION FOR THE SMALLEST OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES. THOSE WITH TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR FEWER. AND SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER COULD YOU MISTER MATTHEWS YOU ARE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE BECAUSE- MY B. S. METERS FULL WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMMENTS I'VE HEARD ON THIS BILL. YOU KNOW THE FIRST MILLENNIAL COMBAT VETERAN WITH A PURPLE HEART ELECTED TO STATE OFFICE IN THE COUNTRY. I FIND IT EXTREMELY APPALLING. TO LISTEN TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES SPEAK ABOUT LIFE OR DEATH. THE WAY I'VE HEARD. YEAH THIS BILLS GOT A CARVE OUT FOR TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS. LET'S LET'S TYPICAL POLICY WE SEE THIS LET'S PUT A CAP AT TWENTY FIVE SO YOU KNOW. THE COMPANY THAT'S GOT TWENTY SIX EMPLOYEES IS TOTALLY SCREWED. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT. WE'VE SEEN SUICIDE RATES RISE BY OVER A PLACE WHERE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE COMBAT VETERANS TWENTY TWO DIE SUICIDE A DAY. AND I'M SEEING THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY ARE WORKERS EVERYBODY. A 4100% RICE. DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT A LIFE OR DEATH. THE STOCK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS BILL IS RETRO ACTIVE. SO LET'S BREAK DOWN WHAT THAT MEANS FOR SOME O YOU WHO APPARENTLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS. IT MEANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK. IN BUSINESSES THAT HAVE ALREADY HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS THE DIDN'T KNOW THIS THAT WE'RE NOT PLANNING ON THIS. THIRD JUST OVER THE BRINK. ARE GOING TO GET KICKED. WITH THE LAWSUIT. BUT MAYBE ALREADY KNEW THAT MAYBE YOUR ATTORNEY BUDDIES BACK HOME ARE ALREADY PLANNING THOSE LAWSUIT TELL MAYBE THEY'RE ALREADY WRITTEN OUT. WE FIND IT SURPRISING. SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WHEN THAT LAWSUIT HAPPENS LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SINCE YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT BUSINESS THAT'S GOT. TWENTY SIX EMPLOYEES. IT'S GONNA FILE BANKRUPTCY. IN THOSE TWENTY SIX PEOPLE THEY'RE COMING OUT OF A JOB. NOBODY ELSE IS HIRING BECAUSE IT'S STILL COVERED WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THIS THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME TO GO THE OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING. YOU'LL THE GO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN IT RETROACTIVELY CLONES IN HITS THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE ABOVE THAT TWENTY FIVE. THEY'RE GOING DOWN TAT'S LIFE OR DEATH. THAT'S THE REALITY. THIS DOESN'T HELP THEM IT KILLS THEM ASK FOR NOBLE ON SB NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU MR MCAFEE. TORONTO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY FIVE AND SINCE THERE'S BEEN SOME DEBATE ON THIS I WANT TO TOUCH ON THE RETROACTIVE COMPONENT OF THE BILL AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OR PAGA WHICH WAS REFERENCED EARLIER COMMENTS IN HERE'S HOW THE BILL WILL WORK ITS ALL SET FORTH VERY CLEARLY IN THE BILL AN EMPLOYER CANNOT BE IN VIOLATION OF PAGA. UNLESS THEY ARE IN VIOLATION OF A STATUTORY OBLIGATION IN THIS CASE THE STATUTORY OBLIGATION DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL JAN TEN DAYS AFTER THE BILL'S% ENACTMENT TEN DAYS AFTER THE BILL'S ENACTMENT THE BILL CALLS FOR A RETROACTIVE PAYMENT FROM THE EMPLOYER AFTER THE WORKER REQUESTED AND AB EIGHTY FOUR SB NINETY FIVE ALLOWS FOR THE REST ABOUT THE PAYMENT TO BE PAID ON OR BEFORE. THE NEXT PAYDAY THIS HELPS ENSURE EMPLOYERS CAN MAKE THE PAYMENT AS PART OF THE TYPICAL PAY CYCLE ALREADY PROGRAMMED INTO THEIR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ADDITIONALLY THE BILL CLARIFIES HOW THE RATE OF PAY IS CALCULATED WHICH ALSO HELPS ENSURE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT UNFAIRLY PENALIZED SO THE BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC ON HOW PAYMENTS ARE TO BE REQUESTED. AND HOW THEY ARE TO BE MADE SO TO BE CLEAR AN EMPLOYER WILL NOT HAVE VIOLATED ANY STATUTORY OBLIGATION TRIGGERING POTENTIAL PAGA PENALTIES UNTIL AFTER AFTER THE LEGISLATION TAKES EFFECT I REQUEST FOR RETROACTIVE PAYMENT IS MADE AND IF THE EMPLOYER FAILS TO MAKE THE RETROACTIVE PAYMENT BY THE APPLICABLE DUE DATE OTHERWISE THE EMPLOYER WILL NOT HAVE VIOLATED ANY STATUTORY OBLIGATION SO THERE WILL BE NO VIOLATION OF THE LABOR CODE. TRIGGERING AN EMPLOYER'S RIGHT EMPLOYEES LIKE THE POPULARLY IF AN EMPLOYER FOLLOWS THE CLEAR PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THEY WILL NOT AND CANNOT BE PENALIZED HOPE THAT CLARIFIES THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISS BONTA. MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS COLLEAGUES I RISE TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB NINETY FIVE I'VE SEEN THE ASSEMBLY DO A LOT OF IMPORTANT WORK- IN MY YEARS AS SPEAKER ONE OF THE THINGS I'M MOST PROUD OF IS HOW WE HAVE RISEN TO THE CHALLENGES OF THE COVE A PANDEMIC. WHEN FIRST WHEN WE FIRST CONFRONTED THIS CHALLENGE A YEAR AGO WE QUICKLY WORKED TOGETHER IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO TRY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS TODAY IS ANOTHER TIME WE HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE HARD WORK OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WENDY CARILLO AND ARANDA GONZALEZ FOR HELPING TO BRING THIS BILL TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN TAKE ACTION TO DO JUST THAT. IT TAKES NO GREAT FEAT OF IMAGINATION TO SEE THE HARDSHIPS OF WORKERS WHO FEEL COVE AND FORCING THEM. TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HEALTH AND A PAYCHECK. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. EMERGENCY HOUSE WE'VE SHOULD BE THERE RIGHT THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE IT. THIS BILL IS STRUCTURED TO EXEMPT SMALL BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. THAT IS pECONOMIC BACKBONE. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO FOR WORKPLACES IS TO MAKE SURE WORKERS ARE HEALTHY. THAT IS ALSO THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR CALIFORNIA. WE CAN DO THAT TODAY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.
