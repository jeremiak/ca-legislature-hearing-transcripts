THE RIVER IS AVAILABLE- ALL RIGHT SO I BELIEVE WE HAVE- DEPUTY SECRETARY HANDS- INDIVIDUALS WHO VISIT RIGHT. PLEASE THANK YOU- SO MUCH YES MY IS THE MON HANSEN I AM THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY PLAN TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR. HAVING ME I'M JENNIFER NORRIS SOME DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR BIODIVERSITY AND HABITAT AT THE RESOURCE AGENCY THANK YOU. JUST GONNA LAY OUT A COUPLE OF- THAT IMPORTANT POINTS FOR BACKGROUND AND THEN HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- I JUST WANT TO START BY THANKING THE LEGISLATURE FIGURE PARTNERSHIP- ON ADVANCING A RECORD SETTING CLIMATE BUDGET LAST YEAR AND FOR INCLUDING. THIRD THAT I TALK ABOUT TODAY WHICH IS THE NATURAL WORKING LAND SECTOR MAKES UP APPROXIMATELY 90% OF CALIFORNIA'S ONE HUNDRED IN PHILLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION ACRES OF FARMS FORESTS WETLANDS DESERT'S COMMUNITY GREEN SPACES AND MORE. WELL CALIFORNIA'S EFFECTIVELY CHAMPION AND CLIMBED ACTION ACROSS MANY SECTORS SUCH AS ENERGY TRANSPORTATION AND INDUSTRIAL PROCESS THESE. ARE STATE HAS HISTORICALLY NOT EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF OUR LANDS IN CLIMATE ACTION. TREES PLANTS GRASSES AND SOILS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN REMOVING AND STORING CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND WHEN OUR LANDSCAPES ARE HEALTHY THEY CAN PROVIDE A POWERFUL SINK TO ABSORB GREENHOUSE GASES AND THEY CAN HELP US MOVE TOWARD OUR GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY. HEALTHY LAND SO PROTECT PEOPLE AND NATURE FROM THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND BUILD OUR RESILIENCE TO FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS. CERTAINLY THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE WHEN OUR LANDS ARE UNHEALTHY THEY BECOME ANOTHER SOURCE OF CARBON POLLUTION RELEASING MORE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STORE. AND UNDERMINING OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY. IN ADDITION UNHEALTHY LANDS INCREASE CLIMATE RISKS TO PEOPLE AND NATURE. AND THEY THEMSELVES ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS SO A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TO RESTORE FOREST HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. THESE EFFORTS PROTECT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THEY REDUCE RISKS AND BUILD THE RESILIENCE OF OUR FORESTS TO WITHSTAND FUTURE CLIMATE IMPACTS. AND PROTECT REFUGIA WHICH ARE PLACES WHERE PLANTS AND ANIMALS CAN THRIVE IN A CHANGING CLASS. SAN ALSO. ON OUR GREENHOUSE AND GOALS. INCREASING THEIR ABILITY TO SAFELY AND SUSTAINABLY STORE CARBON OVER THE LONG TERM AND REDUCING EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IN ADDITION TO THE CLIMATE SPECIFIC BENEFITS- OF THESE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS THEY CAN ALSO STRENGTHEN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES STRATEGICALLY REDUCE RISKS TO CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES THEY CAN IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES SAFEGUARD MUCH OF THE STATE'S WATER SUPPLY. PROJECT ESSENTIAL BIODIVERSITY AND EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THROUGH TOURISM RECREATION AND SUSTAINABLE WOOD PRODUCTS AND JOBS. THE PATH TO A CARBON NEUTRAL EQUITABLE AND RESILIENT FUTURE IS NARROWING. AND THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE OCCURRING FASTER AT A GREATER MAGNITUDE AND WITH GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN PREDICT CALLS FOR DRIVING DOWN EMISSIONS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BUILDING CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN EVERY SECTOR INCLUDING OUR NATURAL WORKING LAND SECTOR. A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON ADMINISTRATION ACTION TO DATE IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THE GOVERNOR CALLED FOR ACCELERATED USE OF NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS TO DELIVER ON CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY GOALS THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER AND EIGHTY TO TWENTY. LAST MONTH WE RELEASED THE FIRST EVER STRATEGY TO GUIDE AND ACCELERATE CLIMATE ACTION ACROSS OUR NATIONAL WORKING LANDS. AND IN ADDITION TO OUTLINING HOW MANAGING LANCE CAN SUPPORT OUR CLIMATE GOALS THE STRATEGY ALSO IDENTIFIES HOW THESE ACTIONS CAN INCREASE EQUITY PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. NUMBER TWO NINETY AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S BIODIVERSITY. AT THE SAME TIME WE RELEASED OUR PATHWAYS TO THIRTY BY THIRTY STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF CONSERVING WATERS BY TWENTY THIRTY. THIRTY THIRTY IS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT TO PROTECT NATURE AND THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS ARE PLANET. CALIFORNIA'S THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVE WILL CONSERVE OUR LANDS AND COASTAL WATERS TO SAFEGUARD OUR UNIQUE FILED BY BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY INCREASE ACCESS TO NATURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND DELIVER CLIMATE ACTION. WORK IS ALREADY UNDERWAY TO SUPPORT NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND AS NOTED AT THE OUTSET THE GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS A LEGISLATURE COMMITTED RECORD FUNDING TO DO MORE THROUGH THE MULTI BAND MULTI YEAR BENEFIT. MY GOD MULTI YEAR BUDGETS APPROVED LAST YEAR. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET IN COMMITTED ONE POINT FOUR BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OVER THREE YEARS FROM MULTI BENEFIT NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. THE BUDGET INCLUDES APPROX THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND YOUR INVESTMENTS. AB THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUPPORTING IMMEDIATE DROUGHT RESPONSE FOR COMMUNITIES AND FISH AND WILDLIFE AND STRENGTHENS LONG TERM WATER RESILIENCE FOR NATURAL SYSTEMS IMPROVE RESILIENCE OF THE STATE'S FORESTS AND WILDLANDS TO WITHSTAND LONG TERM CLIMATE THREATS. AND FOR PROTECTION FOR WILDFIRE BILLABLE COMMUNITIES. A MULTI BENEFIT BASED THAT DELIVER ON THE EXECUTIVE I JUST MENTIONED TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE EXPAND OUTDOOR ACCESS PROTECT BIODIVERSITY. COMMUNITY GREENING INITIATIVES THAT SUPPORT THE STATE'S CLIMATE AND EQUITY GOALS SCALE SUPPORT FOR CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE PLANNING AND PRACTICES. ACTION FOR THE OCEAN CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL RESTORATION PROJECTS AND COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE FUNDING THAT CREATES ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND NATURE BASED SECTORS SUCH AS AGRICULTURE FORESTRY AND CLIMATE RESTORATION ALSO INCLUDED SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OVER TWO YEARS TO KICKSTART IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CLIMATE SMART STRATEGY AND PATHWAYS TO THIRTY BY THIRTY. WE RELEASED A PROPOSED APPROACH TO INVESTING THESE FUNDS IN APRIL. IT BUILDS ON EXISTING FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE BIODIVERSITY CRISES IT UNDERSCORES CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO ADVANCING EQUITY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE BOTH INITIATIVES IT WAS DEVELOPED IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO FIVE KEY PRIORITIES THAT EMERGED FROM OUR YEAR LONG PLUS PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT TO DEVELOP BOTH OF THOSE STRATEGIES. BUCKET IS THE- THE PROPOSAL IS INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA THERE'S A CHART SO THE FIRST BUCKET IS ALL ABOUT ACCELERATING IMPLEMENTATION. WE'RE PROPOSING TO BUILD ON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INVESTMENTS THROUGH THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR PROGRAMS THAT FIND STATEWIDE NATURE BASED SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION. THE MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO PROGRAMS THAT NO LONGER HAVE THUNDER FUNDING AVAILABLE. OR IN SOME CASES ARE YOU. THE SECOND BUCKET OF OUR- PROPOSAL- REALLY SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL ACTION IN THE SPACE SO WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL TO WORK ALONG SIDE SO MANY CLIMATE AND CONSERVATION LEADERS MANAGING LANDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I'M THESE INCLUDE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES FARMERS AND RANCHERS LAND TRUST'S COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFITS LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS IS COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT AND MORE THERE'S A LOT OF PLAYERS IN THIS SPACE AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK. IT'S OUR PROPOSAL INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS AND ACCELERATING NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. THE THIRD AREA OF FOCUS IT IS EXPANDING ACT EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG CLIMATE LEADERS AND CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN WE DID OUR GAUGE MEANT ACROSS ALL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA WE HEARD SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN DELIVERING ON TO THE GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE AN OPPORTUNITY AGENDA. THEY'RE EXPANDING OUR RESTORATION ECONOMY JOBS AND MARKETS THAT CONSTRUCT OPERATE MAINTAIN OR SUPPORT NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS IS THE LEGACY OF LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE AND ARE PROPOSING TO INVEST FIFTY TWO MILLION FOR THE STATE COR. TO SUPPORT PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND TRAINING AND SUPPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING LOCAL CORE AND A NEW TRIBAL COURT. THE FOR THE AREA OF FOCUS OF OUR PROPOSAL IS PARTNERING WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES WERE PROPOSING TO INVEST ONE HUNDRED MILLION TO SUPPORT TRIBAL INITIATIVES THAT ADVANCE SHARED CLIMATE AND BIODIVERSITY GOALS THROUGH NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. THESE INCLUDE RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. TRIBAL NATURE BASED CLIMATE CONSERVATION PROGRAMS INCREASE ACCESS AND CO MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND ANCESTRAL LAND RETURNS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE INFORMED THROUGH A TRIBALLY LED AND INFORMED PROCESS AND WAS DEVELOPED REPUBLICAN GAUGE MEANT AND GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONSULTATIONS WITH OVER SEVENTY CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. AND THE FIFTH AND FINAL AREA OF FOCUS IS- AS SET OF PROPOSALS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ADVANCE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES- WE'RE PROPOSING TEN MILLION. AT FOR THIS BUCKET IT'S GOING TO ADVANCE THE NUMBER OF NEAR TERM PRIORITIES THAT REQUIRE- PILOTING CONSULTATION AND ANALYSIS CONSULTANT SERVICES. THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT LAUNCHING A PILOT COMPOSTING PROGRAM IN ADDITION THESE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT CA NATURE WHICH IS A SUITE OF INTERACTIVE MAPPING AND VISUAL VISIBLE IT VISUALIZATION TOOLS SORRY. TO ADVANCE THIRTY BY THIRTY AND THEY'RE ALSO GONNA BE USED TO INFORM OUR APPROACH- TO A NUMBER OF AREAS OF NEAR TERM FOCUS FOR STATE ACTION THAT REQUIRE CONSULTANTS SERVICES EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS CONVENING. ANALYSIS AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND PARTNERSHIP AND I CAN GO INTO MORE DETAIL LATER IF NECESSARY SO WE KNOW THAT SUCCESS IN THE SECTOR REQUIRES COLLECTIVE ACTION AND CREATIVITY AND THE STATE REPS HERE TODAY IT ACROSS pGRATEFUL TO PARTNER WITH ALL OF THOSE I MENTIONED EARLIER AND THOSE WHO I DID NOT MENTION PER ABSOLUTELY DRIVING ON THE SPACE- TO DO. IT STARTED SO. IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US TO ADDRESS THE CRIME CRISIS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU- BUT I WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT- LET'S HEAR FROM ALEJO FIRST. GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS HAILING CHRISTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE JUST HAVE A FEW HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON THE PACKAGE- FOR YOU TODAY. I'M SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO POINT OUT IS THAT THE PACKAGE IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOALS AND PLANS- SO I'VE YOU HEARD THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT PLANS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS- COMPLETED OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO- INCLUDING THIRTY BY THIRTY. THE NATURAL WORKING LANDS CLIMATE START SMART STRATEGIES AND AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND THE REALLY THOSE ARE WHAT'S INFORMING AND DRIVING THIS- CERTAINLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AT AGREES IN CONCUR WITH THOSE PRIORITIES IN THOSE PLANS- WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT THESE- THAT THE PACKAGE HELPS. HELPS TO PUSH THOSE FORWARD. HOWEVER IF THE ADMINISTRATION BURKE THE MINISTRATIONS PERSPECTIVE MAYBE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. I'M CERTAINLY. THERE COULD BE CHANGES THAT THAT MIGHT BE MERITED. I'M THE SECOND. POINT I WANTED TO BRING UP IS THAT- MEASURABLE GOALS- SO IN SOME CASES SOME OF THE PROGRAMS HAVE IDENTIFIED GOALS FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF ACRES TO BE TREATED OR PURCHASED HOWEVER IN OTHER CASES THERE ISN'T THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION- THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT HARD FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS OF REALLY WHAT WOULD BE H. FROM THAT THE PLAN. ON WHAT THIS IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE THE PROGRAM'S HOW CLOSE THIS WILL GET US TO THOSE GOALS TO BE HEARD ABOUT YOU KNOW WE HEARD HEARD ABOUT THIRTY BY THIRTY I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE ACTUAL QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS OKAY IF WE- IF WE- THIS PACKAGE. YOU KNOW WHERE WILL WE BE WE'RE- FOR AT 24% NOW. WITH THIS BRING US TO. 26% 28% WHERE WILL IT BRING US. ON THAT THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER AND ONE THAT- THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE INFORMATION YET TO ASSESS. FOR THIS PACKAGE- AND THEN ALSO IF IT MAKES A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HOLD ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE. AFTER THE FACT- WITH REGARD TO WHAT WHAT WAS ACHIEVED FROM THE PACKAGE. I'M SO WE DO THINK LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO CLEAR MEASURABLE PLAN- BECAUSE WE THINK THOSE ARE YOU KNOW ARE AREAS THAT- ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS REALLY COULD BE COST EFFECTIVE WE THINK THAT. THAT COULD BE SOMETHING TO LOOK AT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME PROGRAMS APPEAR MORE- APPROPRIATE FOR ONE TIME FUNDING THAN OTHERS SO THIS PACKAGE IS A TWO YEAR PACKAGE AND THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE AGREEMENT. ON THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE LAST YEAR. BUT SOMETIMES THE PROGRAM'S REALLY NATURALLY WORK FOR ONE TIME FUNDING IF YOU'RE DOING YOU KNOW MAYBE. PURCHASING EASEMENTS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF A NATURAL ONE TIME FUNDING ACTIVITY. OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITIES STATE GRAZING. YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE TYPE OF ACTIVITY THAT- PROBABLY HAVE TO HAPPEN. OTLEY OVERTIME IT HAS TO HAPPEN N AN ONGOING BASIS TO BE REALLY FULLY EFFECTIVE. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER THERE ARE CERTAIN ASPECTS CERTAIN PIECES OF THIS PACKAGE- THAT WOULD REALLY BENEFIT MORE FROM ONGOING FUNDING. UNLESS FROM THIS ONE TIME APPROACH. I'M WE WOULD ALSO NOTE. THAT ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE PACKAGES EXCLUDABLE FROM THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. BUT THERE THERE'S ABOUT A- HUNDRED MILLION BUT TWO HUNDRED. NOT EXCLUDABLE THAT'S ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS YOUR SORT OF FORMING YOUR BUDGET LOOKING AT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BUDGET- TO THINK ABOUT. WHETHER YOU WANTED. TO THROUGH DIRECT MORE MONEY POTENTIALLY TOWARDS THOSE EXCLUDABLE PURPOSES- WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE. SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED IN THIS PACKAGE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IN THE PAST- AND WE THINK THAT. IS A FUNDING SOURCE THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE POTENTIALLY TO FIND SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES- IF THAT WORD THAT THE DESIRE OF THE LEGISLATURE SO. I'M TO GIVE YOU SOME OPTIONS IN TERMS OF CRAFTING YOUR BUDGET POTENTIAL OVERLAPPING PROGRAMS FUNDED IN THIS AND OTHER PACKAGES. OF FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S FUNDING FOR THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROGRAM THERE'S ALSO FUNDING THE WELFARE PACKAGE FOR THAT. THIS PACKAGE THIS. IN THIS PACKAGE IS DIRECTED TOWARDS PROGRAMS ARE PROJECTS THAT HAVE A GRADING COMPONENT- WORDS THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR THE WELFARE PACKAGE BUT- YOU KNOW IT'S STILL SIMILAR PROGRAM- ALSO WITH WHAT. A WILD WILDLIFE CROSSINGS FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S SOME FINDING OTHER PLACES IN THE BUDGET. SO YOU'LL JUST WANT TO LOOK HOLISTICALLY- BECAUSE THESE ARE SUCH CROSS CUTTING ISSUES RIGHT AND- THEY'RE ONES THAT ARE. BUT SHOW UP SOMETIMES IN OTHER PACKAGES AND OTHER PROPOSALS. I'M SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT SORT OF BROUGHT A FEW. I WOULD SEVEN. THIRTY DETAIL ON SOME OF THE COMPOUND AND SERVE THE OF THE- I'M FOR EXAMPLE- ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WAS NOTED WITH THAT HUNDRED MILLION FOR TRIBAL- PROGRAMS- WE THINK IT'S- CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE. TIME TO INVEST IN AND- THE AREA SUPPORTING TRIBES. ARE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING FOR LEGISLATORS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAIL ON HOW THAT MONEY WOULD BE SPENT. ON SOME OF THE THINGS LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS WELL- WHETHER IT WOULD LIKE TO. KIND OF CREATE SOME STATUTORY STRUCTURE OR SOME PRIORITIES FOR THOSE FUNDS- ANOTHER AREA WHERE- THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAIL IS ON THE- WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD FUNDING. OF THE FUNDING COULD GO TO SIX DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. THAT THE BOARD WOULD BE. WOULD BE. IN THE POSITION OF THE FIGHTING HOTEL THOSE FINE THE PUBLIC AND- TO THE APPROACH FLEX- BUT ALSO TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIES FOR THOSE FUNDS THAT COULD. YOU COULD- MEMORIALIZE THOSE. I'M THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES- THE FINAL POINT I'D LIKE TO BRING UP IS- THAT THE PACKAGE LIKE SORT OF AN OVERALL APPROACH FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING. WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AT STAKE SOME OF THESE ARE YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF CASES THEIR NEW PROGRAMS- OR IN SOME CASES THERE EVEN PILOT PROGRAMS- THE LEGISLATURES WE THINK THAT I WANT TO KNOW. WHAT WAS ACHIEVED FROM THESE FUNDS- SO THAT WE CAN INFORM FUTURE DECISIONS FUTURE FUNDING. I DETERMINE WHETHER WE WANT TO EXTEND FUNDING BEYOND TWO YEARS IN SOME CASES FOR THESE PROGRAMS- SO. WE THINK THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WILL PROBABLY WANNA WANNA CONSIDER SOME WHICH- PACKAGE BEST. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HI MORNING LET'S TO OF FINE. THAT WOULD JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE SET ASIDE WAS NEGOTIATED AS PART OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CLIMATE BUDGET. NOT THE AGREEMENT WAS TO PROVIDE SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND OVER TWO YEARS SO THIS PROPOSALS INTENDED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT AGREEMENT. AND THAT THEREFORE INCLUDES FUNDING PROPOSED ON A ONE TIME BASIS HOWEVER WE ALSO DID WANT TO NOTE. THAT MANY PROGRAMS HAVE EXTENDING CONFERENCE AND AVAILABILITY TO ALLOW FUNDING TO BE AVAILABLE OVER MULTIPLE YEARS SO. MOST OF THE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS REGIONAL ACTION PROGRAMS HAVE TWO TO THREE YEARS TO ENCUMBER FUNDING. AND THEN FINALLY AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED TO BE PLANS THAT INFORMS THE ALLOCATIONS OF THIS PACKAGE. OUR NEWLY RELEASED SO WE REALLY SEE THIS PACKAGE AS PRIORITIZING FUNDING ON A SHORT TERM BASIS TO JUMPSTART IMPLEMENTATION. OF THESE PROGRAMS WHILE PROVIDING TIME TO LET YOU WAIT WHERE ONGOING FUNDING COULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. SO I CAN ASK IN THE MEDIA FOLLOW UP QUESTION- JUST SO THAT I UNDERSTAND TO- HOW THIS FUNDING WILL WORK- AND I'M- JUST- RANDOMLY- CHOOSING THE- WETLANDS RESTORATION PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS- IN THE- BUDGET YEAR- AND ZERO FOR- FOR THE- FOR THE OUT HERE- M. I. A. I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT THAT FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE ENCUMBERED SO THAT IT COULD BE. SPENT OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S CORRECT THAT FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THREE YEARS. THANK YOU. I'M SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS SAID THAT ARE ALREADY EMBEDDED IN THE- IN THE AGENDA AND THE- THE FIRST ONE- INQUIRES SO WHY WE ARE SHIFTING FUNDING. FOR WILDLIFE QUARTERS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS LONG SUPPORTED- AND I YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- BUT THE PAST FINDINGS GONE THROUGH THE- WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD AND IT'S PROPOSED TO NOW CREATE A SECOND PROGRAM WITH- DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THAT WHY IS THAT WHAT WAS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. HATCHER OF THEM JENNIFER NORRIS CALIFORNIA RESOURCES AGENCY THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I THINK THE ANSWER REALLY IS ABOUT EXPEDITING THESE PROJECTS- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH PARTNERS ON THE GROUND TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH FISH PASSAGE AND WILDLIFE CROSSINGS. WHEN JENNA FIVE ONE OF THE PROJECTS THEY THEN HAVE TO APPLY TO THE WCB FOR THAT FUNDING TO GIVE THE SOURCE OF FUNDS TO DFW WOULD ELIMINATE THAT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS DELAY AND ALLOW THEM TO PARTNER MORE DIRECTLY AND HAVE ASSURANCE THAT THESE PROJECTS CAN MOVE FORWARD SO IT'S REALLY JUST AN EFFICIENCY AND IT IT RECOGNIZES DSW'S IMPORTANT ROLE. IN WORKING WITH PARTNERS. SO ARE YOU PROPOSING TO MOVE ALL OF THIS KIND OF FUNDING OVER TO- DFW NO WE THINK HAVING TO STREAMS OF FUNDING ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF PARTNERS AROUND THE STATE. OKAY OF. THE COMMISSION FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THAT SPECIFIC CHURCH THING AND THAT IS SO IF- IF DFW HAS EXHAUSTED THEIR FUNDS THEY COULD pRIGHT FOR THE FUNDING OR ABOUT THE OTHER WAY AROUND COULD PEOPLE APPLY TO DFW FOR THEIR FUNDING. IF THAT'S TRUE BECAME LOOK AT YOU I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE DIRECTOR AVAILABLE REMOTELY YEAH LET'S DO THAT YEAH AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT SO IF YOU- IF YOU HAVE A PROJECT- THAT WOULD SEEM. QUITE LOGICAL FOR THE APPLICANT TO APPLY TO BOTH AGENCIES. AND THAT SEEMS MORE COMPLEX TO ME BUT AT LEAST FROM NAY- PERSPECTIVE OF- OF THE- PROJECT MANAGERS. LET'S BRING IN DOCTOR BOTTOM AND SEE IF HE CAN. HELP US WALK THROUGH AN EXAMPLE MAYBE. THANK YOU CHAIR FOR THE QUESTION AND THOSE ARE GREAT ANSWERS BUT- IT'S N. C. DEPUTY SECRETARIES I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL BENEFITS. FROM THIS APPROACH BUT. MOST IMPORTANTLY I'D SAY I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EITHER OR I DON'T THINK IT'S EITHER W. C. B. OR DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF FIXING THESE QUARTER PROBLEMS IS SO LARGE IT'S GOING TO TAKE IN ALL THE ABOVE AND EVERYBODY. SO HERE ARE A COUPLE OF THE BENEFITS. FIRST I THINK IT'S EXPERIENCE IN HISTORY. THE LEGISLATURE IS FUNDED OVER THE DECADE I'VE BEEN DIRECTOR OF VARIETY OF THINGS THAT HAVE PRODUCED THE EVIDENCE AND THE INFORMATION WE'VE DONE THE ESSENTIAL MAPPING OF ALL THE LIKELY TOP TIER CORRIDOR CHALLENGES WE'VE DONE THE SAME THING ON THE FISH PASSAGE FROM ALONG THE WHOLE COASTAL ZONE. THE STATE'S. AND SEE SO WE HAVE THE IN HOUSE SCIENTIST WHO ARE THE EXPERTS ON THE BEARS AND THE BOBCATS AND- THE CRITTERS THAT EITHER ARE AFFECTED BY OR WILL BENEFIT FROM. A SECOND- BENEFIT IS IT'S POTENTIALLY FASTER AS A DEPUTY SECRETARY NORRIS MENTIONED. SO TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TOOK TO DROUGHT FUNDING THE DEPARTMENT- PURSUED A GRANT FROM THE W. C. B. TO SPORT FISH PASSAGE PROJECTS AND THE BOARD PROCESS ADDED ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO THE OVERALL TIMELINE FOR US TO GET THE MONEY OUT IN THE FIELD TO FIX SOME- CORRIDOR PROBLEMS SO THERE IS A FASTER BENEFIT POTENTIALLY. THIRD BENEFIT THERE ARE SYNERGIES AT THE VERY TIME. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGET FOR DOING THE ACTUAL PROJECTS. THE DEPARTMENT WILL ALSO BE CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING AS AN EXAMPLE SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY CREATE THE MITIGATION CREDITS POTENTIALLY FOR PROPONENTS WHO ARE DOING THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND I THINK HAVING SOME FUNDING AT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGED IN THOSE VENUES COULD CREATE SYNERGIES THAT ALLOW US TO DO MORE PROJECTS. NEXT IN A FIT IN THIS ONE'S PRETTY DIRECT I THINK IN ALMOST OVERLY BLUNT. I MAY GET AN ABILITY TO TALK TO CALTRANS IN A DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIP CONTEXT IF OUR DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY HAS SOME SEED MONEY TO CONTRIBUTE TO DOING THESE PROJECTS. AND THEN THE LAST BENEFIT IS THE DEPARTMENT IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH OUR SISTER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND THAT THE DEPARTMENTOF THE INTERIOR NATIONALLY WHO IS MANAGING ITS OWNS FUND FOR THESE PURPOSES AND US HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF FUNDING. MY ALLOW US TO LEVERAGE ALL OF THAT BETTER AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR A HALF AN FOR THAT ANSWER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS HEY ADAM ALL OF THE I AG I CAN APPRECIATE THE BENEFITS OF THE CHANGE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- IT. IF THE BOTH PARTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR GOOD PROJECTS THAT'S ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THEN I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT MAKING THE PROCESS MORE COMPLEX- AND- WE'RE PROVIDING. CUT UP MULTIPLE PATHWAYS BUT- NOT ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY- THAT NEXT QUESTION- A RELEASE TITLED- NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS PROGRAM. OF WHAT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SAID- DO YOU ENVISION BEING FUNDED BY THOSE AND THEN FOLLOWING ON- WITH- THE- ELIAS'S COMMENTS CAN YOU DISCUSS SO WHAT KIND OF METRICS WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THOSE PROGRAMS AND- DETERMINE THEIR SUCCESS. BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH TERRY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT TODAY ON THE TRIBAL NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS- PIECE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR A NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS SATISFIED AND ALSO WHEN YOU TO THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR. HEALTH PARTNERSHIP IN ADDRESSING HISTORICAL ROCKS I TOWARDS CALIFORNIA AMERICANS AND TRIBES UNDISPUTED TO THE HEALING. HI MY NAME IS GINNY BABY THOMPSON AND I'M THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. AND TO RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES WILL BE FUNDED IN THE TRAP. THE SOLUTIONS PROGRAM- WE REALLY ARE SEEING THIS PROGRAM IS BEING A TRIBALLY LED PROCESS AND WORKING IN COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. ARE THROUGH CONSULTATIONS ALSO THROUGH A- A TRIBAL ADVISORY COUNCIL AND BASED OFF OF OUR- OF OVER SEVENTY DIFFERENT- GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONSULTATIONS WE HAD IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF. A NETWORK LAND CLIMATE SMART STRATEGY THE PATHWAYS A THIRTY BY THIRTY STRATEGY AND SO WITH ALL OF THE THAT OUTREACH IN COLLABORATION- WE ANTICIPATE A TRIBALLY LED- ASSESSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS GRANT PROGRAM- AND SO BUT WE THROUGH OUR PAST CONSULTATIONS- WE DO HAVE SOME EXAMPLES AND ANTICIPATE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WILL COME OUT OF THE FUNDS. I'M INCLUDING DEVELOPING A CLIMATE AND BIODIVERSITY TRAVEL MONITORING PROGRAMS OF SUPPORTING PATHWAYS FOR CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS TO RESEARCH DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE IS AND SHARING THOSE KNOWLEDGE AS TO FUTURE GENERATIONS HOW TO SUPPORT- YOU KNOW THE FUTURE CULTURAL PRACTITIONERS- AND THESE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. I WE ALSO ANTICIPATE PROJECTS AROUND CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT TWO X. CELEBRATE EXPELLER EIGHT NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS CONSERVATION BIODIVERSITY PROJECTS IN TRIBAL LANDS AND COMMUNITIES- WE ALSO ANTICIPATE PROJECTS THAT WILL SUPPORT EXPLORE INCENTIVES FOR TRIBAL PARTICIPATION AND OTHER CONSERVATION PROGRAMS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A LINK TO THIRTIES AND IN THE END- AND ALL THE OTHER PARTNERS THAT W. SECRETARY HOT HANDSOME INTENDED OPENING REMARKS I LASTLY WE ANTICIPATE PROJECTS THAT INCREASE COMMENCEMENT AND ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES AND ANCESTRAL LAND RETURN. THAT WILL DELIVER ON CLIMATE IN BIOTECH THE BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIA. FILE IN OUR CONSULTATIONS WE ALSO HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT- A PROGRAM NEEDS. AND IN OVERCOMING SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT TRIBE DAVID FACING- SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS INCLUDE LIMITED TIME AND CAPACITY FOR GRANT PROGRAMS OF OVERLY COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS- THE NEED FOR TAILORED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AND HAVING FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR PLANNING PROJECTS AND SO TRIBES IN LEVERAGE LEVERAGE OTHER STATE FUNDS AND FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THEIR PRIORITIES AND NEEDS. IT'S A WE AT THIS IS THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WE ANICIPATE COMING OUT OF THE TRIBAL NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS PROGRAM. WILL WATER GRANT PROGRAMS BE INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL. BUNTINX CAN'T THE WATER GRANT PROGRAM. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- COOPER FOR WATER GRANT PROGRAMS. SO OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS PROGRAM KEY AND- SUPPORT THE LEVERAGING OF OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS AND SO THROUGH A TRIBALLY LED PROCESS WORKING WITH TRIBAL LEADERS AND SUPERVISORY COUNCIL AND DETERMINING WHAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL BEST SUPPORT A TRIBALLY IN THE NATION. THANK YOU AND THEN- ONE OTHER QUESTION- THAT- JUST TO- CLARIFY THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SOB THIS IS ALSO FUNDING THAT WOULD BE ENCUMBERED FOR- USE OVER MULTIPLE YEARS MR. AND SO IT WOULD BE- USED FOR BOTH THE PROCESS. FOR DETERMINING PROJECTS AND POTENTIALLY ALSO FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT RIGHT YES. RIGHT THANK YOU- THE LAST QUESTION THE AGENDA- ASKS- HOWTHE- TROUBLE CONSERVATION CORPS- ACCRUE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO. BE IMPLEMENTED YES SO THE PROPOSAL THAT'S IN YOUR OFFICE IN THE TODAY- SHOWS THAT THE CALIFORNIA PATIENT CO- THE WILL SUPPORT FOR TRIBAL- AND THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM THAT- THAT WILL IS IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE HEARD IN CONSULTATION- WITH TRITON DEVELOPING BOTH THE STRATEGIES. AND THE THESE CORES WILL BE- DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP AND- TRIBALLY LED TO BE TAILORED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR TRIBAL NATION PARTNERS AND- EARLY THEIR CONSERVATION NEEDS WITH THE AT SPECIFIC FOCUS ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. FOR SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD YOUTH- THAT ARE SELECTED BY TRIBAL LEADERS AND TRIBAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRAVEL. OF THE BALLOT NO WORK DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE- WITH PROJECTS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS AND TRIBAL PRIORITIES- THE MECHANICS OF THESE WILL BE VERY SALAS SIMILAR TO LIKE THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AND REGIONAL CORPS CREWS BUT WILL ALSO BE- TRIBALLY LED AND TO TAILOR TO FEET FIT THE SPECIFIC TRIBES AND THE CREWS THAT WILL BE SUPPORTING THE- ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER. THANK YOU TAX. I HAVE A COUPLE FORM IN REGARDS TO THE L. A. ILLS OF ADMINISTRATIONS NOT PROVIDING MEASURABLE GOALS FOR THE THIRTY BY THIRTY IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEASURABLE GOALS HOW DO WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO OUR END WE HAVE AN UPDATE THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET BEFORE WE GO THROUGH TWO YEARS. OF THIS FUNDING. JENNIFER NORRIS CALIFORNIA TO RESOURCE AGENCY AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. OF THIRTY BY THIRTY ITSELF IS A MEASURABLE GOAL THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY TRACKING AND WE WILL BE- FOLLOWING HOW THESE FUNDS ARE SPENT- WHETHER THEY'RE- MOVING FORWARD ON ACQUISITIONS OR EASEMENTS WHICH PART OF STATE. AND I WHICH OF OUR OBJECTIVES THEY DO DRIVE ON SO WE'LL BE TRACKING THOSE. WHO GET THE PAGES WILL GO ALONG AND ENCOURAGE THE WCB FOR THE DESERT CONSERVATION. IN MY DISTRICT PRETTY MUCH IS A DESERT AND I'M BIG CONCERN WITH THE JOSHUA TREES. AND WE'RE GOING TO GET AN UPDATE PRETTY SOON IF IT'S GOING TO BE IN DANGER OR NOT. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THIS HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MAKING SURE THAT THEY SET ASIDE A PROPERTY. THAT WE CAN STILL DEVELOP WITH INDIA. INDIA OF KINSA JOSHUA TREES THAT I FEEL IS NOT IN DANGER. AND I DON'T KNOW IF TO BOND INTERVIEWING LIKE KNOW IF THAT WAS A QUESTION. WE CAN HAVE DIRECTOR BOTTOM I. JUMP IF THERE IS A- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M- CUTELY AWARE OF ALL THINGS WESTERN JOSHUA TREE ARE SEPARATE COMMISSION WILL BE DELIBERATING ON THAT IN JUNE. I DO THINK IT'S SEPARATE FROM THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT TO A REALLY IMPORTANT. EMERGING AND NEW ENTITY TO HELP CONSERVATION IN THE DESERT BUT I'M AVAILABLE- AT YOUR OFFICES REQUEST TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU OFFLINE ON ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT JOSH WITH TRADITIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BENNETT WE GAVE YOU A LITTLE TIME YOU CAME UP WITH ANOTHER QUESTION. I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH ON THE- PUSHING THE BUTTON- THIS. GUY I WOULD WANT TO COMPETE WITH THE MCGINNIS ON JEOPARDY RIGHT- NOT A COMPETITION. PLEASE I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PILOT PROGRAMS IT SEEMS THAT IF WE IDENTIFY PILOT PROGRAMS WE WANT START AND THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE AS A OVERALL ARCHING POLICY pSO THAT'S GOING TO COME UP MORE THAN ONCE HERE SO I WON'T REPEAT IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN- IT AND COMBINED WITH THAT- I THINK WE CONSISTENTLY GET RID BE SUGGESTIONS FROM ALEJO. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE- MEASUREMENTS GOALS YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS IT HOW DO WE EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM LIKE CENTER AND THAT WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE- WHO RATHER THAN HEARING THAT EACH TIME AND HOPE. I COULD COME UP WITH A WAY TO SORT OF A STAB SOME. SORT OF YOU KNOW SOME PROGRAM AROUND THAT THAT WHEN THE BUDGET REQUEST COMES IN THAT THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS- DRESSED- STRIKES ME AS AS AN APPROPRIATE WAY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT. THE QUESTION NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED WHAT IS YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE MEASUREMENT TOOLS OR ONE OF THE GOALS ARE ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE COULD PUT HOW CAN WE EVALUATE WHETHER THIS HAS BEEN. THE FACT OF- USE OF THESE DOLLARS SO- THAT'S- YOU KNOW GOING TO CONNECT. BEING REPEATED I WILL REPEAT THAT THE REST OF THE DAY TODAY BUT THOSE ARE TWO THINGS I'D LIKE TO. TO HOPEFULLY HAVE BECOME OVER ARCHING THINGS FOR THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT AND THAT- BRINGS US TO THE CONCLUSION OF ISSUE ONE. WILL SHUFFLE SOME OF THE FOLKS AT THE- AT AT THE TABLE AND- CONTINUE WITH THE ISSUE NUMBER TWO A- DRESSING THE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF EXTREME HEAT. DEPUTY SECRETARY WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. SHUFFLING MY PAPERS THANK YOU TAKE IT TO YOUR SERVICE THE SECRETARY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY- AND OUR AGENCY IS STATUTORILY RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING CALIFORNIA'S UPDATE TO OUR STATE ADAPTATION. HE THIS YEAR WE DID IT IN. TIGHTKNIT PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH GIVEN THEIR RESILIENCE PROGRAM JUST. GIVE ME A MOMENT INTRODUCED YOURSELF GREAT SERVICE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I'M NEW IN TARA KEY I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. SO I THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO PRESENT ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION. EXTREMELY SATISFIED- I'M GONNA PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION FUNDING PROPOSAL WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN. AND THEN A NEW IN TARA WILL PROVIDE. THE SET ASIDE. SO ON ON SORT OF BASICS FOR HEAT IMPACTS JUST FOR PUTTING US ON THE SAME PAGE BEST AVAILABLE CLIMATE SCIENCE PROJECTS THAT EXTREME HEAT WILL IMPACT EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE OPPOSING WRECKS RISKS TO EVERY REGION AND EVERY SECTOR. EXTREME HEAT THREATENS CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES NATURAL SYSTEMS AND ECONOMY IT ALSO PROPOSES. POSES PROFOUNDLY DISPROPORTIONATE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US. ADDRESSING THESE INTERCONNECTED COMPLEX IMPACTS OF HEAT REQUIRES A DIVERSE SUITE OF ACTIONS AND RESOURCES AND AN ALL OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH. ANNUAL TEMPERATURES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ALREADY EXCEEDED ONE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WITH SOME AREAS EXCEEDING TWO DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. DURING THE SPRING HEATWAVE EARLIER- IN THE SPRING OF LONG BEACH REACHED A HIGH OF A HUNDRED AND ONE DEGREES BREAKING ITS LAST DAILY RECORD SET BACK IN APRIL OF TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH A HIGH OF NINETY TWO. LAST YEAR WE EXPECT THE HOTTEST SUMMER ON RECORD WITH DEATH VALLEY SETTING AN UNFORTUNATE WORLD RECORD FOR THE HOTTEST MEASURE TEMPERATURE IN HISTORY. HITTING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY DEGREES IN ULY. AND FRESNO SAW OVER SIXTY DAYS ABOVE ONE HUNDRED DEGREES. THE DAILY MAXIMUM AVERAGE TEMPERATURE WHICH IS AN INDICATOR OF EXTREME TEMPERATURE SHIFTS IS EXPECTED TO RISE BETWEEN FOUR POINT FOUR AND FIVE POINT EIGHT DEGREES FAIR RIGHT BY TWENTY FIFTY. FIVE POINT SIX AND EIGHT POINT EIGHT DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. GET A GOING TO THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN NOW- THE ACTUAL PLAN WAS DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE STATE'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE UPDATE TO CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY IN RECOGNITION OF A REAL NEED FOR AN UPDATED. INTEGRATED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING EXTREME HEAT ACROSS STATE AGENCIES. THE PLAN THE PLAN PROVIDES A STRATEGIC AND COMPREHENSIVE SET OF STATE ACTIONS TO ADAPT AND BUILD RESILIENCE TO EXTREME HEAT. IT OUTLINES ARE ALL OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO MITIGATING THE HEALTH ECONOMIC CULTURAL ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF INCREASING TEMPERATURES. AND THE ACTIONS INCLUDED PLAN WERE DEVELOPED AND REFINED BY OVER A DOZEN AGENCIES AND OVER FORTY OF THEIR DEPARTMENTS COMMISSIONS COUNCILS BOARD OFFICES THE CONSERVANCY'S ALL OUR PARTNERS. IT WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH EXTENSIVE PUBLIC INPUT OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR. AND THEN PUT STATE THE PROGRAMS INCLUDED AND HE'D SET ASIDE PROPOSAL IT ALSO DEP. THE IN AN CONTACT OF THE EXTREME HEAT ACTIONS. AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT SHAPE THE EXPEDIENT PLAN IS HOW IT IS ORGANIZED WHICH IS AROUND FOUR ACTION TRACKS SO WE HEARD FROM OUR ENGAGEMENT THAT THERE IS REALLY FOR AREAS WHERE STATE. ACTION AND COMMITMENT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL THE FIRST IS AND BUILDING PUBLIC AWARENESS AND NOTIFICATION WHICH WILL INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEALTH THREATS AND PREPARATION FOR EXTREME HEAT EVENTS. THE SECOND AREA OF FOCUS IS ON STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY SERVICES IN RESPONSE WHICH ARE ACTIONS TO INCREASE. CASSIDY REDUCE SIX AN INCREASE PROTECTIONS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO EXTREMELY. THIRD AREA OF FOCUS FOR STATE ACTION IS INCREASING RESILIENCE OF OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT WHICH WILL REDUCE HE'S PETE RISKS IN THE TRANSPORTATION ENERGY AND BUILDING SECTORS AND FINALLY THE FOURTH AREA OF FOCUS AND ACTION TRACK IS UTILIZING NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS TO COLMOBIL COMMUNITIES AND BUILD RESILIENCE OF NATURAL SYSTEMS TO INCREASING TEMPERATURES THAT ARE ON THEIR WAY. THAT ARE HERE AND ON THEIR WAY- SO THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN ALSO IDENTIFIES SIX AREAS OF NEAR TERM FOCUS WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROPOSALS INCLUDING THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN- THESE INCLUDE. IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE PUBLIC HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY HEAT ILLNESS EVENTS EARLY TO MONITOR TRENDS AND TRACK ILLNESSES TO INTERVENE AND PREVENT FURTHER HARM. ACCELERATING THE READINESS AND PROTECTION OF COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY EXTREME HEAT INCLUDING THROUGH COOLING SCHOOLS AND HOMES SUPPORTING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS AND EXPANDING NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS POPULATIONS THROUGH CODES STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS EXPANDING ECONOMIC ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND BUILDING A CLIMATE SMART WORKFORCE THAT CAN OPERATE UNDER AND ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT. INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS TO REDUCE RISKS POSED BY EXTREME HEAT AND PROTECTING NATURAL WORKING LANDS ECOSYSTEMS AND BIODIVERSITY FROM THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT SO I'LL NOW HAND IT OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE EVEN TARA TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE SET ASIDE PROPOSAL. THANKS CURO AMANDA AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE SO- BEFORE I GET INTO THE SET ASIDE JUST FOR CONTEXT YOU KNOW IN LIGHT OF THE IMPACTS- THAT AMANDA WENT THROUGH AND GIVEN THE CROSS CUTTING IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT. AT LAST YEAR'S HISTORIC CLIMATE BUDGET COMMITTED EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION TO ADDRESSING EXTREME HEAT OF THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION OF THESE FUNDS WERE SET ASIDE TO ADVANCE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN WHICH ON MONDAY JUST WENT THROUGH. AS AMANDA MENTIONED THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN INCLUDES AND IDENTIFIES THOSE AREAS OF NEAR TERM FOCUS AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW BEFORE I GO THROUGH WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE SET ASIDE PACKAGE. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR- TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY FUNDING- PROPOSALS THAT FILL OUT AND ADDRESS THOSE AREAS OF NEAR TERM FOCUS THAT AREN'T COVERED IN THE EXTREME HEAT SATISFIED. AND HAPPY TO TALK THROUGH THAT MORE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS ON THE CONNECTIONS BUT JUST A NOTE OF CONTEXT THERE INCLUDES PROGRAMS FROM SEVEN STATE ENTITIES ACROSS THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AGAIN. DEMONSTRATING HOW THE CROSSCUTTING NATURE OF THIS PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT. SO THE SATISFIED IS ORGANIZED AROUND FOUR CATEGORIES THE FIRST ONE INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ACCELERATE READINESS AND PROTECT COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY EXTREME HEAT. INCLUDING THROUGH COOLING SCHOOLS SUPPORTING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS AND EXPANDING NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. THIS INCLUDES FIFTY MILLION TO CAL FIRE TO COOL SCHOOLS BY WORKING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHERS TO FOCUS THE URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM GRANT FUNDS TOWARDS THE GREENING OF SCHOOLYARDS. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS CATEGORY IS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION PROPOSED TO GO TO THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO COMMUNITIES SEEKING TO BUILD. FOR GREAT EXISTING BUILDINGS AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING COMMUNITY SOCIAL STRUCTURE. S. CATEGORY OF THE SENATE SIDE IS TO PROTECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND ECOSYSTEMS FROM EXTREME HEAT RISKS THIS CATEGORY INCLUDES FOR FORTY THREE POINT ONE MILLION. THE FIRST SET OF INVESTMENTS PROPOSED THROUGH THIS CATEGORY ARE TO ENHANCE PROTECTIONS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING WORKERS IN HIGH RISK INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUALS AND LICENSED CARE FACILITIES. THIS INCLUDES TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH. AND WILL BUILD UPON AND EXPAND ITS TARGETED OUTREACH AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES THIS WILL BE COUPLED WITH TARGETED ENFORCEMENT BEFORE AND DURING PERIODS OF HIGH RISK. IN ITS DONE THERE'S ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PROPOSED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH BRANCH WHICH WILL CONDUCT OUTREACH TO EMPLOYERS TO INFORM THEM ABOUT EXTREME HEAT RISKS IN INDOOR AND OUTDOOR SETTINGS APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND RESOURCES FOR ASSISTANCE IN MINIMIZING RISK. THIS CATEGORY INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY TO PROVIDE OUTREACH OVERSIGHT EDUCATION AND TRAINING ABOUT EXTREME HEAT AND IT'S A FAX. TO THE SURVEYORS OF LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. LASTLY IN THIS CATEGORY THERE'S EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION PROPOSED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE TARGETED INFORMATION TO PREVENT HEAT RELATED ILLNESS FOR ITS LICENSED RESIDENTIAL AND CHILD CARE. FACILITIES BUT LACKS THE RESOURCES TO ADEQUATELY PREVENT HEAT IMPACTS. IN ADDITION IN THIS CATEGORY THERE'S ADDITION THERE'S ALSO FUNDING TO PROTECT NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS ECOSYSTEMS AND BIODIVERSITY. THERE'S PROPOSED TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATIONS TO SUPPORT SMALL UNDERSERVED FARMS AND LARGE DISADVANTAGED URBAN CENTERS THROUGH INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OUTREACH. IN ADDITION THERE'S FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION FOR CDFA TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO HANDLE UNEXPECTED ANIMAL MORTALITY DUE TO EXTREME HEAT AS WELL AS PROVIDE ORIGIN INSPECTION SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT PASS THAT MAY THRIVE UNDER INCREASED HE CONDITIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM ENTERING THE STATE. THE THIRD OF FOUR CATEGORIES IN THIS SET ASIDE INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS TO REDUCE RISKS POSED BY EXTREME HEAT WITH THE PROPOSED TWENTY MILLION TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO DELIVER A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN WHOSE KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDE ENGAGING A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. AND THIS CAMPAIGN WILL INCLUDE DEVELOPING TAILORED AWARENESS MATERIALSAND WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MEDIASPECIALIZING IN IN LANGUAGE AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT CONTENT. AND FINALLY THE FOURTH CATEGORY INCLUDES SEVENTEEN MILLION TO EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND BUILD A CLIMATE SMART WORKFORCE THE CAN OPERATE UNDER AN ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT. THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT. THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW OF WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE EXTREME HEAT SET ASIDE PACKAGE AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. HEARTMATE LEFT TO HEAR FROM A ALEJO. I THANK YOU CHAIR- AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT UNITS ROW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SAID TODAY WE HAVE A FEW INITIAL OVER ARCHING COMMENTS- TO THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE. THE OVERALL WE FIND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE IS COMPRISED OF A DIVERSE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES RANGING FROM DIRECT RELIEF FOR EXTREME HAVE THAT KEY EVENTS TO EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS I WORK PLACES. HOWEVER WHILE SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES MAY HAVE MERIT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE PROPOSALS ADDRESS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCERNS ADDRESSED- ASSOCIATED WITH EXTREME HEAT. AND WHETHER THIS COMBINATION OF A PROPOSALS IS THE MOST STRATEGIC WAY TO ADDRESS SUCH PRIORITIES. THIS PACKAGE IS INTENDED TO ALIGN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECENTLY FINALIZED EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN WHICH DOES INCLUDE SEVERAL GOALS. HOWEVER THE PLAN LACKS A CLEAR STRATEGY AND MEASURABLE GOALS AND IT MAKES WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROPOSED PACKAGE. IS THE BEST APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE MOST PRESSING CONCERNS RELATED TO EXTREME HEAT. IN ADDITION WE FIND THAT. THOUGH IT FUNDS A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES AT IT IS LIMITED IN SOME IMPORTANT AREAS SUCH AS- DIRECT HEAT REDUCTION ACTIVITIES- AND RESEARCH. FIRST WITH RESPECT TO DIRECT HEAT REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS THE PACKAGE IS NOT INCLUDE SOME CRITICAL BUILDING LEVEL INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS AIR CONDITIONING INSTALLATIONS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS. IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE SPEND THE MOST OF THEIR DATES SUCH AS THEIR HOMES SCHOOLS WORKPLACES. AND THESE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS COULD PROVIDE DIRECT RELIEF FROM EXTREME HEAT I AM ESPECIALLY FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MODIFY THEIR SURROUNDINGS WITHOUT STATE ASSISTANCE. SECOND ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR RESEARCH MIGHT BE WARRANTED ADAM DID BECAUSE MUCH UNCERTAINTY REMAINS ABOUT WHICH POLICY INTERVENTIONS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. OF EXTREME HEAT- FURTHER RESEARCH SUCH AS PILOT PROGRAMS RESEARCH AND EVALUATION- COULD HELP PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION AND SUCH AS WHICH ACTIVITIES ARE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO. ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT I AM AND WHICH PROGRAMS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AT REACHING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AB. WHICH TYPES OF ACTIVITIES ARE MORE SUITED FOR ONE TIME FUNDING AND SOME TYPES OF ACTIVITIES ARE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR ONE TIME FUNDING THAN OTHERS SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS PILOT PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH I AM BECAUSE THE BENEFITS OF THESE ACTIVITIES. AB REMAIN AFTER THE FUNDING ENDS FOR EXAMPLE THE GREENING SCHOOLYARDS PROPOSAL AND IS STUDENTS TEACHERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN. AND THE FAT FROM SHADES THAT BY MORE SHADED SCHOOLYARDS AND TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS AYE WELL BEYOND THE FUNDING PERIOD IN. AN CONTRAST USING ONE TIME FUNDING I AM FOR. AT LIMITED TERM STAFFING AND SERVICES MIGHT BE LESS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THEY ONLY PROVIDE BENEFITS DURING THE FUNDING PERIOD. I'M FOR INSTANCE THE PROPOSED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER CAL OSHA LIKELY WOULD NEED TO BE CONDUCTED ON AN ONGOING BASIS FOR A TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT AT. THE MAJORITY OF THE PACKAGE IS CONSIDERED EXEMPT THAT EXCLUDED EXCLUDABLE FROM STYLE BUT EIGHT ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT SO. GIVEN THAT THE STYLE WILL CONTINUE TO CONSTRAIN THE STATE'S BUDGET AT. OPTIONS THIS YEAR AT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER SHIFTING MORE FUNDING ADD TO SALAS CRITICAL ACTIVITIES. AT WE ALSO KNOW AS THE ADMINISTRATION MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO DOES INCLUDE SOME OTHER EXTREME HEAT RELATED PROPOSALS. OUTSIDE OF THIS PACKAGE SO FOR EXAMPLE THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE TEN MILLION FOR IT THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE REAL TIME DATA. ON THE IMPACTS OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF EXTREMES OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING EXTREME HEAT. AND I THIS IS ALSO IN ADDITION TO THE M. THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND THAT THAT LEGISLATURE APPROVED AND THAT KIND OF PACKAGE LAST YEAR FOR EXTREME HE ACTIVITIES. THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO. CONSIDER THE FUNDING PROVIDE SO. THAT SORRY THE LEGISLATURE MON MAY WANT TO CONSIDER ALL OF THESE KIND OF- FUNDING PROVIDED FOR ALL RELEVANT HEAT RELATED. PROPOSALS TO INSURANCE APPROACHES ADAM STRATEGIC COMPREHENSIVE AND NOT DUPLICATIVE. AND FINALLY THE PROPOSED A PACKAGE CURRENTLY DOES NOT INCLUDE A PLAN TO REPORT ON THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE ACHIEVED WITH THE FUNDING. M. AND NOT ONLY WITH SUCH REPORTING BANK KEEP THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE AND TO MEET THE INTENDED GOALS OF THE PACKAGE BY. I WOULD ALSO HELP THE LEGISLATURE CONDUCTED ITS OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS M. AND ALSO COULD HELP AT THE LEGISLATURE. ON FUTURE POLICY AND FUNDING DECISIONS REGARDING EXTREME HEAT STRATEGIES AT TO ASSESS WHICH APPROACHES HAVE BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND WHICH PER- PROGRAMS MIGHT WARRANT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE FUTURE. AND SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS WERE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU PRETTY SURE THAT'S ALL. THAT WAS A LOT COMPREHENSIVE IN YOUR- ANALYSIS OF DOES SAID- THE- DEPARTMENTS HAVE ANY COMMENTS THINKING YES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CLIMATE BUDGET TO PROVIDE THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND OVER TWO YEARS.BUT LIKE THE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS PACKAGE WOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THE PROGRAMS DO HAVE EXTENDED AVAILABILITY WITH MOST PROGRAMS HAVING TWO TO THREE YEARS TO ENCUMBER FINDS. AND THEN AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THERE ARE MANY OTHER COMPLEMENTARY PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO WE REALLY SEE THIS SET ASIDE AS PROVIDING FILLING SOME GAPS. AND DEMONSTRATING THE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING TO ADDRESSING EXTREME HEAT AND THEN FINALLY WOULD ALSO REITERATE THAT THE EXTREME HEAT EXTREME HEAT. PLAN WAS RECENTLY RELEASED SO THIS PROP PACKAGE PRIORITIZES FUNDING ON A SHORT TERM BASIS TO JUMPSTART THE WHILE PROVIDING TIME TO EVALUATE THE NEEDS FOR ON GOING FUNDING. THANK YOU- SO- IS IT INTENDED THAT- P. R. KIND OF BE THE MAIN AGENCY THAT IS COORDINATING. ALL OF THIS. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION- SO OPR THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH A DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH SENATE BILL TWO FORTY SIX DOES SERVE AS THE STATE'S HUBFOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION POLICY ALIGNMENT AND COORDINATION IMPORTANTLY ACROSS AND WITH OUR AGENCY PARTNERS. BUT ALSO WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ON THE GROUND WHO ARE REALLY LEADING UP IMPLEMENTATION SO IN CONTEXT OF OUR ROLE IN STATE GOVERNMENT AS THAT PUB FOR RECORD NATION AN ALIGNMENT- WE ARE ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING AN EXTREME HEAT- PROGRAMS GRANT PROGRAM IN THIS COMING BUDGET YEAR GIVEN- DECISIONS THE AGREEMENT AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. SO WITH ALL OF THAT CONTEXT IN TERMS OF OUR ROLE AS THAT COORDINATING HUB AND GIVEN THE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY WE WILL HAVE- IN SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING EXTREME HEAT THROUGH OUR NEW GRANT PROGRAM WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO COORDINATE AND ALIGN EFFORTS ACROSS STATE AGENCIES ON EXTREME HEAT. THANK YOU AND- THIS QUESTION MAY- COPY APPROPRIATE FOR A CAL FIRE AND WE'VE GOT- SOMEBODY EITHER HERE IN THE ROOM OR A ROOM UP. AVAILABLE REMOTELY- THE- I URBAN GREENING FUNDING IS- AS DIRECTED SCHOOLS FOR SOME OF THE URBAN GREENING OF FUNDING IS DIRECTED AT SCHOOLS ON- CAN YOU DISCUSS THAT MORE AUNT- WHY WOULD THAT NOT BE FUNDED WITH. PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO ELABORATE ON THE URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM HAS IN THE PAST BEEN FUNDED BY BOTH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AND THE GENERAL FUND COVER AND NOT A PROP NINETY EXPERTS I'M HAPPY TO. I'D TAKE THAT QUESTION BACK TO MY EDUCATION COUNTERPARTS GREAT THANK YOU- AND THEN- WHAT ASPECT SAYS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION. THINGS LIKE SMART GRID AND BATTERY STORAGE- OF. HOW HOW DO WE INTEGRATE THOSE INTO- EXTREME HEAT MITIGATION. SO HAVE I BELIEVE WE HAVE A COLLEAGUE HERE FROM THE- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND HE'S PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR EIGHT ELEVEN TAKE MY FEET. WELCOME THANK YOU TWENTY CHAIRED MEMBERS- RAPHAEL WITH THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD HYDRO TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM- SPEAKING TO THE QUESTION- REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND SAY- I APPRECIATE BEING HERE WITH MATCH RESEARCH AGENCY PARTNERS AND- PR BECAUSE OF THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO BE SORT OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT AND- TALKING ABOUT. NOT TO RESOURCES AND CLIMATE- F. AB THIRTY TWO PASSED A LONG TIME AGO. TO GET CONVERSATION GOING ON WORKFORCE BUT HERE WE ARE SITTING AT THE TABLE UP FRONT. TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE AND SO OUR APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING- H. I. T. P. HIERO TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS IS TO. HAVE A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS. THESE ARE JUST SOME PRELIMINARY IDEAS WE HAD AS FAR AS LIKE WHO WOULD WE PARTNER WITH AND WE KNOW- H. BACK FOR A COUPLE CONSTRUCTION OUTDOOR WORKERS ARE AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND- DIFFICULT. REQUEST WE THAT. YOU KNOW THE GREATEST THEY NEED TO BE HARDENED- RESPONSE TO EXTREME HEAT. AND YOU KNOW ALL THE QUICKENING WOULD NEED TO BE CHANGED OUT AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED TO BE ADAPTED. SUCH AS- YOU KNOW SMART GRIDS AND- BATTERY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES BUT- SOME OF THE EXISTING INDUSTRIES- CONSTRUCTION ELECTRICIANS THOSE OF THE TRADE THAT WOULD BE WORKING WITH THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE PARTNERSHIPS IN THOSE AREAS SO. WE BEGUN THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT- THESE ARE IDEAS AND CONCEPTS THAT WE WOULD- IDENTIFY. POTENTIAL PARTNERS AND EVEN DO OUTREACH BUT IT WOULD BE THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS THAT WE WOULD- ADMINISTER THESE FUNDS. THEN WE WOULD DO SO- YOU KNOW. AND WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES AGENCY AND OTHER PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY THOSE PROJECTS. THANK YOU AND I- TANGENTIALLY AT I DON'T THINK WE GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO- THE IMPACT OF EXTREME HEAT ON THE WORK FORCE- AND PARTICULARLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WHERE MUCH OF THAT WORK IS DONE OUTDOORS- WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT HOW WE- PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE IMPACT OF. OF EXTREME HEAT AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND CHECK YOUR BEING HERE WE DON'T TYPICALLY SEE HERE AND IN STEP THREE SO THAT'S A NICE CHANGE OF PACE FORCE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT- YOU HAVE QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE QUESTIONS OF YOUR OWN I KNOW YOU HAVE FOR- ON BEHALF OF THE THIS RIVAS AS WELL. THANK YOU CHAIR I WILL I WILL START QUESTIONS FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROB RIVAS- WHO WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND- SO HER OFFICE- REACHED OUT TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD ASK THESE QUESTIONS SO THE FIRST ONE FOR CAL FIRE- BUT I KNOW YOU RESPND. ON CALIFORNIA'S BEHALF BEFORE SO PERHAPS YOU WILL- AND THE URBAN FORESTRY- GREEN SCHOOLYARDS PROGRAM FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- THAT'S OUT THERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AUTHORED- AB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT AND TWENTY NINETEEN AND THIS YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON- HAS AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY SIX OF BOTH BILLS SEEK TO SUPPORT SCHOOL GREETING- GIVEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY HAVE DETAILS ON OF THE GREENING UP PROJECTS THERE- WILL CAL FIRE WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO INCORPORATE TO PROVISIONS OF AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY SIX INTO THIS PROPOSAL. MAYBE I COULD TAKE A FIRST CRACK AT THAT AGAIN- TURNED TO COLLEAGUES FROM CAL FIRE- TO- IF EITHER ADD TO IT OR- GOD FORBID CORRECT THE RECORD- SO I THINK THE IDEA HERE IS- IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO US TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE BILLS ARE- MOVING FORWARD AND- END UP SORT OF. SORT OF SETTING A FRAMEWORK FOR US THAT THE WORK THAT WE DO TO GREEN SCHOOLYARDS AT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM ABSOLUTELY ALIGNS WITH THOSE EFFORTS SO- MAKE THE TOP LINE ANSWER IS YES WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THOSE BILLS MOVE FORWARD WE WOULD PARTNER. PLEASE CORRECT THE RECORD OR WEIGH IN WITH ADDITIONAL DETAILS PARTNERS THAT CALIFORNIA NEED BE DEPUTY DIRECTOR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT WITH CAL FIRE AND- THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT WE SUPPORT THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO- TO WORK WITH COLLEAGUES IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAM ALIGNS- WITH ANY OTHER ADDITIONS THAT NEED BE A WE DO BY STATUTE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO. IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM ACCORDINGLY SO WE'RE- WE'RE HAPPY TO POTENTIALLY RECEIVE THE FUNDS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE WHATEVER NEED BE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE DO MINIST ADMINISTER THEM APPROPRIATELY THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU I'M SURE SOME REMEMBER RIVAS WILL APPRECIATE HEARING THAT- SHE HAS- DONE SOME VERY. EXTENSIVE AND AN EFFECTIVE WORK ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF- OF THE HEAT AND THE RESILIENCY THAT WE NEED TO HAVE OUT THERE SO- APPRECIATE THAT THIS QUESTION IS FOR- OPR- AND THE BCP ALLOCATES TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR OPR TO LAUNCH A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN- AND- THE QUESTION FROM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHY ONLY FOCUS ON PUBLIC AWARENESS AND NOT. ACTUAL PROJECTS THAT WILL PREVENT EXTREME HEAT EVENTS OR MITIGATE AND ORDERED MITIGATE THE IMPACTS- AN INCREASE IN FUNDING COULD PROVIDE- P. R. WITH FUNDING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO COMMUNITY EXTREME. ACTION HE ACTION PLANS AND TO FUND COMMUNITY COOLING PROJECTS CAN YOU HELP US WITH THAT PLEASE YES ABSOLUTELY. SO- YEAH AS WITH MANY THE TWO MILLION INCLUDE IN THE PROPOSAL FOR THE SET ASIDE IS FOCUSED ON PUBLIC AWARENESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD- CONSISTENTLY IN OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE LAST YEAR- AS WE'RE DEVELOPING THE HEAT ACTION PLAN. WAS THE NEED TO REALLY BE ABLE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT AND ALSO WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF YOU KNOW EXTREME HEAT EVENTS- IN. IN THAT MOMENT SO THAT FUNDING THE TWENTY MILLION IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED AT HELPING COMMUNITIES BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO PREPARE AND HOW TO RESPOND WITH EXTREME HEAT. NOW AS WAS NOTED IN THE QUESTION THERE ALSO IS NEED TO DEVELOP- LOCAL PLANS EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLANS- AND ALSO TO DRIVE INVESTMENT INTO ACTUAL PROJECTS ON THE GROUND AS WELL. AND THAT'S WHERE WE AT OPR ARE LOOKING AT OUR- EXTREME HEAT AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE GRANT PROGRAM THAT. THAT CAME THROUGH THE BUDGET. LAST YEAR- WE'RE GONNA BE STANDING UP THIS NEW EXTREME HEAT GRANT PROGRAMS. WITH AN INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED MILLION THAT CAME THROUGH LAST YEAR'S BUDGET OVER MULTIPLE YEARS TO TARGET EXACTLY THOSE ADDITIONAL PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION FUNDS THAT ARE NEEDED. IN ADDITION TO IN A WORKING IN CONCERT WITH THE OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON IT FOUND ON THE GROUND A POEM EDUCATION THROUGH OTHER. AVENUES OF THE BUDGET FOR IT THANK YOU- OVERALL OF. A NEW SHE NO AND I NOTE ALL THAT THE- THE ADMINISTRATION'S NOT PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE FUNDS FOR THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE ND HE PROGRAM- IT'LL BE A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITIES WERE REPEATEDLY IMPACTED BY EXTREME HEAT. TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS TO LOWER URBAN HEAT ISLANDS AND MITIGATE AND ACTUALLY PREVENT PICKS- EXTREME HEAT. SO SHE NOTES AND I THINK- WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T TAKE THERE SHOULD BE MORE FUNDING ALLOCATED TO THAT. YEAH THANK YOU ALSO FOR THAT QUESTION- AS I'VE NOTED A COUPLE TIMES WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO LAUNCH THAT PROGRAM WE THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND GONNA HELP ADDRESS MANY YOU KNOW GAPS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN TERMS OF FUNDING- BUT BEFORE REQUESTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON STANDING UP THE PROGRAM AND ALSO WORKING THROUGH A PUBLIC GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO REALLY HELP US IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THIS FUNDING CAN ADDRESS REALLY STRATEGIC GAPS IN. THE LOCAL PLANNING ADDRESSING URBAN HEAT ISLAND AND SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES. AND REALLY BEING ABLE TO TARGET THOSE TO NEAR TERM HIGH IMPACT INVESTMENTS AND THEN LEARNING FROM THAT AND ONCE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. I CAN KIND OF THE SCOPE OF. FUNDING THAT MAY BE NEEDED LONG TERM AND ALSO WHERE BEST TO TARGET THOSE FINE SO YOU'RE REALLY WANTING TO GET THIS PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING LEARN FROM THAT AND THEN BE ABLE TO HAVE AN INFORMED CONVERSATION AROUND ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IN THE NATURE OF. WITH THAT OF THE QUESTION THAT- THE CHAIR BROUGHT UP EARLIER ABOUT PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING BEING USED TO A COULD BE A POTENTIAL WAY TO EXPAND IF UP PROPERLY IT FUNDING WAS USED FOR THE SCHOOL READING PROGRAM- I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION AND THAT IS- TO POINT OUT THAT- IF WE HAVE THIS CONSTANT TENSION AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND LEVERAGE USING RUTLAND TIME FINDINGS FOR WHAT. FEELS LIKE ONGOING IN. SPEND A CHURCH AND TO- A YOU NEXT- IN FORCED HAS- CAL OSHA PAGE TWENTY TWO- WE HAVE- POSITION UNFORTUNATE POSITIONS HERE. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO IMAGINE THAT WE'RE GOING TO STOP ENFORCING- ON EXTREME HEAT TO THE ISSUE SAID AND- BUT IT'S COMING OUT OF ONE TIME FUNDING SO- THE TO THE EXTENT THAT- WERE ALL AWARE OF THAT AND WE CAN TRY TO MINIMIZE THAT- DOES ANYBODY HAVE RESPONSE IN TERMS OF. HOW WOULD YOU PLAN ON YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT- CENTER USING ONE TIME MONEY FOR ENFORCEMENT POSITIONS ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY BUT- AS I NOTED PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED FUNDING DOES HAVE EXTENDED INCUMBENTS AVAILABILITY SO WE DO SEE IT SUPPORTING SEVERAL YEARS OF THESE ACTIVITIES. BUT GIVEN THAT THE ACTION PLAN IS NEWLY RELEASED WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S PRUDENT TO UTILIZE THIS ONE TIME FUNDING TO JUMPSTART THESE ACTIVITIES AND THEN EVALUATE ONGOING NEEDS FOR THE FUTURE. VERY COMMON TECHNIQUE HI THANK YOU. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. WE HAVE- THE P. ARE WITH US. WELCOME DIRECTOR THANK YOU. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. BOB GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS SHIRLEY HENDERSON I'M THE IRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION MORNING MY NAME IS KAREN MORRISON AND ACTING CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR PATTY CARE. SO I'D LIKE TO JUST QUICKLY START WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT. OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT- BY REGULATING PESTICIDES SALES AND USE. BY FOSTERING REDUCED RISK PEST MANAGEMENT. WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE'S PESTICIDE REGULATORY PROGRAM AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE STATE'S PESTICIDE USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. ENFORCEMENT IT'S A SHAREDRESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN DPR AT THE STATE LEVEL AND COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL PESTICIDE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS BY THE COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR STOP. OUR VISION IS TO ACCELERATE THE SYSTEM MY TRANSITION OF SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT STEWARDING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT FOOD PRODUCTION AND SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE URBAN PEST MANAGEMENT. WE'RE ENGAGING AND COLLABORATING WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO AFFECT THIS TRANSITION AND PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT PARTICULARLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE PROPOSED THREE BCPS THIS BUDGET CYCLE TODAY I'M PRESENTING OUR PROPOSAL TO STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIANS PESTICIDE. USE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IT ENSURES THAT THE STATE HAS MULTIPLE TOOLS TO ENFORCE STATEWIDE COMPLIANCE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE REQUEST IS FOR EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. FROM THE DPR FINES FOR THREE PERMANENT POSITIONS TO INVESTIGATE AND DEVELOP PESTICIDE RESIDUE AND USE ENFORCEMENT CASES AND FOR FUNDS TO HIRE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO REPRESENT DPR AND SEVEN ALL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL USE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS PESTICIDE USE AND CALIFORNIA IT COMPLIES WITH STATE LAW AND REGULATION STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT TOOLS WILL BETTER TO TURN BAD ACTORS AND IN DOING SO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THOSE WHO USE PESTICIDES RESPONSIBLY. THE PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH OUR GOAL TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. AND TO BETTER ENSURE THE PESTICIDE USE IS SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD REINSTATE DVRS ADMINISTRATIVE PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTY AUTHORITY AS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL AT THE STATE LEVEL. IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATUTORY ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTY CAPS THAT HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR DECADES AND BETTER ALIGN WITH USEPA AND CALLIE PA BOARD AND DEPARTMENT FIND LEVELS. AND FINALLY IT WOULD STRENGTHEN DPR S. PESTICIDE RESIDUE ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- LA OPEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK JIMENEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE SEVERAL CHANGES THAT PESTICIDE ENFORCEMENT IN PENALTY LEVELS FOR CERTAIN VIOLATIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO PESTICIDE USE RESIDUE SALES AND LICENSING- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL EXPANDS ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY FOR DPR IN TWO MAJOR WAYS. FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE DPR WITH THE AUTHORITY TO LEVY ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES FOR PESTICIDE USE VIOLATIONS WHICH DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE. RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED ADDITIONAL- MAJORITY BEING REQUESTED THE ADDITIONAL FORSMAN AUTHORITY WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO SERVICE THE BACKSTOP TO LOCAL ENFORCEMENT WHEN MERITED SUCH AS SERIOUS MULTI JURISDICTIONAL VIOLATIONS WHILE STILL MAINTAINING- COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS AS THE PRIMARY LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. ARMENTA ALSO REESTABLISH SIMILAR THIRTY DEPARTMENT PREVIOUSLY HELD. SECOND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE DPR WITH ADDITIONAL RESIDUE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY SUCH AS ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT TO LEVY ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES TO ENTITIES THAT DISTRIBUTOR MOVE PRODUCE THAT HAVE BEEN QUARANTINED DUE TO POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH PASS THAT I TESTIFIED RESIDUES. I'M RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE ADDITIONAL THIRTY BEING REQUESTED WE FIND THAT THESE CHANGES COULD BETTER ENABLE THE STATE TO PREVENT CONTAMINATED PRODUCE FROM REACHING CONSUMERS- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO INCREASE AND ESTABLISH NEW PENALTIES ACROSS VARIOUS TYPES OF PESTICIDE VIOLATIONS. THESE CHANGES CAN BE FOUND IN THE TABLE ON YOUR AGENDA OVERALL WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE INCREASE PESTICIDE RELATED PENALTIES AND ALLOW THE DIRECTOR TO ADJUST PENALTIES IN FUTURE YEARS FOR INFLATION. IN MANY CASES PENALTIES HAVE NOT BEEN INCREASED IN SEVERAL DECADES ON A BUS LOST THEIR ABILITY TO DETER VIOLATIONS OVER TIME- INCREASES COULD INCLUDE IMPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED PENALTY LEVELS WHICH APPEAR REASONABLE. ARE SETTING PENALTY LEVEL SOMEWHAT HIGHER LOWER BASED ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DEEMS APPROPRIATE. AND THEN FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING TO SUPPORT DPR PESTICIDE USE AND RESIDUE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE PROVE THE FUNDING BEING REQUESTED. I'M DELUSIONAL FUNDING WOULD ENABLE DEPARTMENT TO CONDUCT THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF PENALTY AUTHORITY AND ALLOWED TO DEPARTMENT TO REFER SERIOUS. AND VIOLENT ACTIONS TO TURN. FIRST HAPPEN TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINAL. LIVE THE AREA OF FINANCE COMMENTS HELPING QUESTIONS THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY. MISTER BENNETT OF I WAS IN THE OPPRESSION THAT THE PENALTIES ARE BEING ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION YOU'RE THE L. A. L. COMMENTS SUGGEST THAT THEY AREN'T BEING ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION COULD YOU HELP ME WITH THAT. NO THEY THEY ARE BEING AN IMPRESSION AND- THE PENALTIES WOULD BE IN PLACE IT WOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION ON GOING AS PROPOSED. OKAY SO YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE COMMENTING THAT THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING OR NOT NOT THAT IT'S MISSING RIGHT OKAY YES CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU. AND AB I JUST WANT TO. REITERATE PUT THAT SAY OFTENTIMES BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WERE THE TWO CULTURES WHERE ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION ON ON THESE THINGS QUICKLY FOR PENALTY- IF A PENALTY DOESN'T GET ADJUSTED FOR TWENTY YEARS THIS IS NOT THE SAME PENALTIES IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO ON CHRISTMAS. FIRST BILLION SO APPRECIATE THAT I DO HAVE ONE- OF THE- QUESTION- AND ON THE PLUS SIDE IMPORTANT PROGRAM. HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION CONSIDERED INCREASING FUNDING FOR OTHER ENFORCEMENT. OPTIONS AND IN PARTICULAR. SCHOOLS A PAST SIDE HER TO BE ABLE TO HELP AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER SWISS THAT ISSUE IT IS- AN EXTREMELY SENSITIVE ISSUE IN THE STATE IS MANNED- COULD. YOU HELP ME WITH THAT WHAT'S YOUR POSITION ON THAT AND ARE YOU CONSIDERING THAT. SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A QUESTION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING IS TRYING TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON COMPLIANCE- WITH- THE CURRENT REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO PESTICIDE REGULAR USE AROUND SCHOOLS- THE CURRENT REPORTING- IS. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS NECESSARILY CAPTURE THE ACCURATE LOCATION ON A PARTICULAR FIELD GIVEN THE NATURE OF REPORTING SO WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE AYE COMMISSIONERS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO ALLOW GROWERS TO BETTER AND MORE ACCURATELY IDENTIFY WHERE THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE HAPPENING. AND SO ONCE WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF- THE COMPLIANCE WILL EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE TO WHETHER ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT RULES WOULD BE EFFECTIVE WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH SCHOOLS TO. WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THEM TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHETHER THERE ARE VIOLATIONS OCCURRING- THAT WE MAY NOT BE AWARE OF AND SO ONCE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION WELL IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT WHETHER. WE SHOULD ADOPT ANY ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT TOOLS FROM AROUND SCHOOL IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST EXPLOSIVE TOPICS WE HAVE OUT THERE. BUT BASED ON SOME EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD IN. THE VENTURA COUNTY WHO WERE ONCE IT HAPPENS IT'S A GROUP EARLY ON THE PUBLIC'S RADAR. SCREEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR FONG WELCOME TO THE- IN SYSTEMS AND AGAIN. I THANK THE CHAIR- BABY MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THE AT DEPARTMENT OF AT TO BUT I'M READING AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THAT A PING PONG BACK AND FORTH YOU HAD IT ALREADY EXPIRED AND THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE FORTY BACK- WHY WHY ARE YOU ASKING FOR THE AUTHORITY BACK IS OR SOMETHING THAT'S- THAT THE CA SEES AREN'T DOING. WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE RATIONALE- THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AND YOU'RE CORRECT WE DID HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND IT EXPIRED AND SO WE ARE- WE'RE ASKING TO HAVE IT REINSTATED THE REASON- THAT WE ARE REQUESTING ADDITIONAL THIRTY IS FOR IT TO PARTICULAR TYPES OF CASES- ONE OF WHICH WOULD BE. CASES WHERE VIOLATIONS ARE HAPPENING IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS- AND THE OTHER IS IF AN AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER IS OF NOT FULFILLING- IF HIS OR HER DUTIES- AND SO THE I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR STATE OVERSIGHT ROLE OF THE PESTICIDE REGULATORY PROGRAM. WE PROVIDE AS AS THE L. A. O. MENTION A BACKSTOP- IN CASES WHERE- NUMBER ONE IF THE ACTION IS NOT BEING TAKEN BUT NUMBER TWO IN A MULTI JURISDICTIONAL CONTACTS WHERE IT'S JUST FAR MORE COMPLEX- FOR INDIVIDUAL COMMISSIONERS TO EFFECTIVELY. ENFORCE THOSE TYPES OF VIOLATIONS SORT IS YOUR CONCLUSION THEN THAT COMMISSIONERS CAN'T WORK TOGETHER THAT OUT THAT THE STATE HAS TO COME IN AND DO IT. NO NOT AT ALL- IT'S JUST A MORE COMPLEX UNDERTAKING- WHEN THERE ARE VIOLATIONS HAPPENING IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND IN ADDITION THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE- FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD IT RESET ACTION- AGAINST AN AERIAL APPLICATOR WHO- BECAUSE DRIFT INCIDENTS ON SOCCER FIELD SCHOOLS IN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT CROPS AND WE ENGAGED- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS PART OF THAT AND- SO IN CASES WHERE IT. WE WANT TO REFER A CASE- FOR EXAMPLE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OUR ENGAGEMENT HELPS TO COORDINATE THE ACTIVITIES. AND SO I JUST ITSIT PROVIDES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE. OVERSIGHT TO ENFORCEMENT. SALEMME DOUBLE DEEPER HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE ST THERE ISN'T ANY PROBLEM BUT YOU WANT THE AUTHORITY. WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST INCREASED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM WITHIN THE COUNTIES. I'M AS YOU SAID THAT THERE IS NO THAT NOT THAT YOU CAN POINT OUT ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS YEAR'S USE RIGHT NOW. NO I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS I THINK IT'S MORE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE IF WE ARE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING ACTION WHEN THERE ARE VIOLATIONS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS. BY INDIVIDUAL COUNTY AG COMMISSIONERS. SO HOW SO HEY. I'M I'M TRYING TO I'M TRYING TO PUT THE TWO SCENARIOS A MAN TRYING TO PUT THE TWO ARGUMENTS THAT YOU BAY TOGETHER THERE IS NO PROBLEM NOW. BUT YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE AUTHORITY. AND IN SOME OUT YOU I SAID WHY CAN'T THE COUNTY AND AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONS WORK TOGETHER AND YOU SAID THEY CAN BUT YOU'D BE BETTER. SO BUT IF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS CAN ALREADY WORK TOGETHER DO AN INVESTIGATION GO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND YOU INCREASE THE PENALTIES ALREADY WITHIN THE POWER WITHIN THE CA SEES WHY NOT ALLOW THAT INSTEAD OF CREATING A WHOLE NEW AUTHORITY- FIT. THE QUESTION I SHOULD STEP BACK AND SAY THAT- WE ARE STICKING NOT AUTHORITY AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL. SO THAT WHEN WE WERE FOR TODAY- THE- CASE AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT WAS WE UNDERTAKE THAT ACTION THAT PARTICULAR ACTION A LICENSING CONTEXT WHAT WE'RE SEEKING AND THIS CASE IS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND FOR PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. SO IF AN AGRICULTURAL COMMISSION AND COUNTY A SUBPOPULATION AND THE SAME- GROWER WAS COMMITTING A VIOLATION COUNTY . THOSE ACTIONS WOULD OCCUR INDEPENDENTLY AND POTENTIALLY NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE OVERALL ACTION OF. THAT PARTICULAR ACTOR AND SO IF WE AS DPR WERE ABLE TO. TAKE A LOOK AND BE ABLE TO ENFORCE AGAINST BOTH OF THOSE VIOLATIONS. WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE- BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH AND BE ABLE TO SEE. THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS AS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUAL VIOLATIONS HAPPENING IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES SO YOU'RE SAYING. A GOOD ADD THIS THIS- TYPE OF AUTHORITY AND HEARING OF A THIRTEEN. OTHER STATE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES OF THE L. A. O. PER PART NOTE CPSC HAS SIMILAR. COVER CYCLE. AUTHOR BLACK. MY CHARACTER OF SIR VIOLATE NEED. AGENTS TO BE ABLE TO. AND TAKEN. ACTIONS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSIONERS. OKAY BUT YOU'RE SAYING OTHER OTHER AGENCIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY WHEN I TALK ABOUT AGENCIES ARE DONE WITH THIS ONE SO WHY DID THE WHY DID THE AUTHORITY LAPSE. C. THIRTY LAST IN AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND SIX- AND WAS- AND PART OF A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS TO THE STATUTE THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE OVERALL PENALTY LEVELS AND SO AT THE TIME THE PENALTY LEVELS WERE MIRRORING BOTH STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND SO I CAN'T COME INTO THE FULL DECISION MAKING THAT WAS MADE AT THAT TIME BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS TIED TO- THE DIFFERENT COUNCILS OR INCREASED ON THE- COMMISSIONER ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY. OKAY SO ANY ANALYSIS IT SAID THAT AB NINE FOUR SEVEN ALLOWED THE AUTHORITY TO SUNSET- I GUESS I'M I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND. NOT THAT THAT WE DON'T NEED TO DO ENFORCEMENT OR NOT TO DO PENALTIES IF THAT IS THERE A PROBLEM IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES NEW AUTHORITY OR CAN THE EXISTING PROGRAM WORK AND WE INCREASE THE PENALTIES. BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT YOU THE YOU THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED THAT IF AN ACT COMMISSIONER IS NOT FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES BUT YOUHAVE NO EXAMPLE ACT MR NOT FILLING THEIR DUTIES. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS- BE PROACTIVE AND ANTICIPATE SITUATIONS WHERE WE WANT THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. ALL OF THE AVAILABLE TOOLS NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY. ENFORCE THE STATE'S PESTICIDE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AND NOT WANT TO HAVE TO UN RING A BELL THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED AND SO. THIS IS NOT. THAT WOULD NOT BE AN OPTION THAT WE WOULD TAKE LIGHTLY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD ONLY BE AN EXTREME CASE WHERE ACTION ISN'T BEING TAKEN. AND I THINK GOING BACK TO THE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE IF I MAY I THINK- IF THERE WAS AN ACTION THAT OF A GROUP OR FOR EXAMPLE A VIOLATION TOOK PLACE IN COUNTY A AND SO THAT I COMMISSIONER IS LOOKING JUST AT THAT. VIOLATION AND IS CONSIDERING A FINE LEVEL BASED ON THAT SINGLE VIOLATION. AND THEN THERE'S A SEPARATE ACTION TAKING PLACE IN ANOTHER COUNTY AND AGAIN NOT AYE COMMISSIONER IS LOOKING JUST AT THAT CASE DOT VIOLATION. WE AT THE STATE LEVEL WOULD STEP BACK AND SAY OKAY THIS ACTOR IS. VIOLATING IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND SO WE WILL LOOK BELIEVE THAT THAT DESERVES A HIGHER LEVEL OF FINE AND PENALTY. GIVEN THE MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE EACH INDIVIDUAL AYE COMMISSIONER WOULD ONLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXAMINE AND CONSIDER. THE VIOLATION AND HIS OR HER COUNTY IN ASSESSING FINE BUT UNDER THAT OKAY SO LET'S LET'S GO FORWARD WITH THAT EXAMPLE. THEN WHY NOT JUST INCREASE. **** WITHIN EACH. SO IF THERE'S MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS I SAY YOU YOU INCREASE THE PENALTIES SO THAT THAT PERSON PAYS MULTIPLE PENALTIES IN BOTH JURISDICTIONS. I COMMISSIONER AND COUNTY A IS GOING TO BE CONSIDERING THE VIOLATION IN HIS OR HER COUNTY. AND SIMILARLY THE AG COMMISSIONER AND COUNTY B. IS GOING TO BE CONSIDERING A VIOLATION AS A AND HIS OR HER COUNTY. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE CONSIDERING THE MULTITUDE OF VIOLATIONS THAT THAT ACTOR HAS COMMITTED WE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND OVERSEEING THE- ENFORCEMENT AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL AND LOOKING AT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS. WOULD BE ABLE TO AN APPROPRIATELY CONSIDER THOSE MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS AND COMING UP WITH A FINE LEVEL. OKAY I GUESS- I SEE. WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE THEN BETWEEN MIGHT MIGHT Y. SCENARIO YOUR SCENARIO HERE YOU'RE JUST ASKING TO AGGREGATE AND- AND SOMEHOW IMPOSE A FINE WHERE I'M SAYING THE INCREASE THE FINES ON AND AT AT AT AT EACH LEVEL AND SO EACH VIOLATION HAS A HIGHER FINE UP FROM. I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS OUR ROLE IS MORE THAN AN AGGREGATOR OUR ROLE IS LOOKING AT A TOTAL PICTURE BECAUSE IT AND I COMMISSIONER WILL LOOK AT A VIOLATION IN HIS OR HER COUNTY AND REALLY CONSIDERED JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HIS OR HER COUNTY AS OPPOSED TO OUR ROLE WHICH WOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT THE OVERALL STATEWIDE ACTIVITIES AND VIOLATIONS OF THAT PARTICULAR AFTER. SO IT'S GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS JUST A VIA A PENALTY OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ONE COUNTY IN THE THOUSAND DOLLAR FILE. PENALTY IN ANOTHER AND WE'RE SAYING THIS ACTOR IS THIS REGARDING THE LAW IS COMMITTING MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS WE THINK THAT'S- WORTH THE PENALTY OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I WE HAVE A IN A BROADER STATEWIDE WE HAVE A BROADER STATEWIDE OVERSIGHT ROLE THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL I COMMISSIONER ASSURANCE HAS ARE COUNTING. I WILL I GOT ANOTHER QUESTION I JUST I DON'T BELIEVE AT THAT POINT I JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THE RATIONALE WHEN A ACT IN AN WHEN SOMEONE IS FIND OR WHEN A FARMER OR A- OR AG OPERATORS. OR PASSES I JUST- AGGREGATORS FIDE WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO. JUNE SHORT THOSE THOSE- FINDS DID PRIMARILY GO BACK TO THE COUNTIES- FORWARD PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT. CIVIL PENALTIES SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL PENALTIES SO IN IN IN THIS NEW PROPOSAL DOES THAT STILL. OPERATE THE SAME WAY. FOR THE PENALTIES THAT OUR LOVE YOU GOT THE COUNTY LEVEL YES- FOR THOSE THAT ARE LIVING AT THE STATE LEVEL THERE IS SOME PROVISIONS TO. CONSIDER THOSE HEALTH IS BOTH GOING BACK TO THE COUNTY AS WELL AS TO THE STATE. AND DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT THE BREAKDOWN IS HOW MUCH GOES TO THE COUNTY HOW MUCH OF THE STATE. NOT AT THIS TIME BUT I WILL NOTE THAT THE BREAKDOWN IS- WERE PRIMARILY LOOKING AT THE AND FINDS A WAY TO- ADDRESS CONCERNS OF BEHAVIOR NOT AS A SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR THE DEPARTMENT. OKAY IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO ME I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE- TO SEE WHERE THE- FINES WOULD GO- AND HOW MUCH WE GO TO THE STATE AND. HOW MUCH WOULD GO TO THE COUNTY THANK YOU SO MUCH TERRY. CERTAINLY MISTER BENNETT. I WAS JUST GOING TO REACH TO MY COLLEAGUES SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND THAT IS THAT- WHILE THERE MAY NOT BE EVIDENCE OF SPECIFIC AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS NOT AND FORCING GOT IT FIXED- I FEEL MY EXPERIENCE OVER TWENTY YEARS THE CASHIER OF AS WE COULD FIND THAT BOOK CROSSES STATE IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS AND- AND CERTAINLY I THINK WE'VE HEARD TO THEM IDENTIFIED REPEATEDLY THAT. THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE AGGREGATES BEHAVIOR ACROSS COUNTY SIS THAT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF THIS PROGRAM SO I THINK THEY'RE TWO BIG ADVANTAGES ONE AND OVERSIGHT FOR AG COMMISSIONERS THAT MAY NOT BE ENFORCING- APPROPRIATELY AND THE OTHER IS THE ABILITY TO AGGREGATE AGGREGATE BECAUSE FOR A BAD ACTOR THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDES ULTIMATELY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT. WE DON'T GET THESE PESTICIDE TO ABUSE SPRAYING. SIX CETERA THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- I THIS IS A- PONTUS PROPOSAL IT'S NOT A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY IN THE REQUEST AND IT'S GOING TO GO A LONG WAY TO. HELPING US ADDRESS SO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT OUR ONGOING ISSUES- WITH A PESTICIDE REGULAR REGULATION VIOLATIONS I THINK- IT SAYS SOMETHING THAT- HOPE. TO BE ABLE TO SUBORDINATE. IN THE IN IN IN THE BUDGET BUT WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER FOUR THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I MISSED MY OPPORTUNITY. ACCEPTABLE. WE HAVE A STEP A CORE WE'RE NOT TAKE ANY VOTE SO THE QUORUM ISN'T APPS IS BUT- AND MAY HAVE MISSED MY OP. ISSUE FOUR IS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PACKAGE ACCELERATION AND- WE HAVE WITH US I BELIEVE THAT DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER CRAIG SICKELS. THAT'S YEAH BUT WELL AYE FINANCE WILL BE MAKING THE OPENING COMMENTS TODAY MR OKAY CHANGE OF PACE PLEASE SO GOOD MORNING I CHAIRED WOMEN MEMBERS CHRISTIAN CULTURE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST LIKE TO START BY HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE PARTICULAR POLLS BUT PROPOSAL BEING DISCUSSED IS JUST A COMPONENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S BROADER RELIEF PACKAGE- THAT WAS RELEASED IN MARCH- SPECIFICALLY THE RELIEF PACKAGE INCLUDES A RELIEF REFINED INCENTIVE GRANTS TO TRANSIT AND RAIL AGENCIES TO MAKE WRITING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FREE FOR THREE MONTHS. A PAUSE ON THE GENERAL FUND PORTION OF THE SALES TAX RATE AND DIESEL AND A FEW OTHER ITEMS BUT SPECIFICALLY THIS PARTICULAR ACCELERATION OF CERTAIN PROPOSED ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PROGRAMS IS THE ITEM BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE PROPOSED BY THIS PROPONENT THE PACKAGE- PROPOSED EXCEL OVER ACCELERATE ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S TEN BILLION THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE CAN. IN TRANSPORTATION UP. THERE REDUCE OUR OVERALL. ON GAS AND FOSSIL FUELS SPECIFICALLY THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES ACCELERATING SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR THAT FUELING. INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME CONSUMER PURCHASES INCLUDING THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL AND FINANCING ASSISTANCE. FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILLION FOR ZERO EMISSION MOBILITY PROGRAMS AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION PRESERVE EQUITABLE AT HOME CHARGING.% EXHILARATING THIS FUNDING INTO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TO HELP THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO INITIATE THE PROCESS SEES TO IMPLEMENT THIS FUNDING. RATHER THAN WAITING ON UNCERTAIN FISCAL FUTURE FUNDING ISSUES IT HELPS CREATE ABOUT GREATER MARKET CERTAINTY AND ENABLES CONSUMERS TO PLAN THEIR VEHICLE PURCHASES WITH CONFIDENCE. THAT THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO VEHICLE REBATES AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THESE EARLY PUBLIC INVESTMENTS PROVIDE A CLEAR SIGNAL TO THE PRIVATE MARKET TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND ACCELERATE THEIR ACTIVITIES. I WILL HAND IT OFF NOW TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENTS- PERSON BE COMMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION ADDRESSING THE COMMITTEES QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I THINK I'M NEXT IN LINE AS A CHAPLAIN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. I'M CRAIG SIEGEL THAT COULD BE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM MOBILE SOURCES AND INCENTIVES A PROVIDE CARDS TESTIMONY ON THIS PART OF THE PACKAGE. I'LL FOCUS ON THE PROGRAMS INVOLVED RATHER THAN THE BUDGET DECISIONS ON THAT DIFFERENT FINANCE HAS PUT FORWARD. AND SUPPORT. NONE THE BOOK FROM HOME OF THIS. THAT ARE BEING ACCELERATED. WERE PROVIDED TOLD OF FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PURCHASE INCENTIVES FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THE CURRENT YEAR. THIS INCLUDES AT LEAST TWENTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH CLEAN CARS FOR ALL OUR LOW INCOME AND SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR NEW VEHICLE PURCHASES ARE USED. STATEWIDE PLUS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DISTRICT RUN CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAMS. AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATEWIDE FINANCING ASSISTANCE FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. AT LEAST FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEW ELECTRIC BIKE INCENTIVE INCENTIVES PROJECT WHICH WE ARE WATCHING THIS YEAR. EXPANDING THESE PROGRAMS MORE RAPIDLY WILL PROVIDE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WILL SUPPORTING THIS HAVE TRANSITION NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS A PROPOSED FOR CELEBRATION FOR ZERO EMISSION MOBILITY CATEGORIES. THIS FUNDING SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY BASED TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROJECTS INCREASE ACCESS TO ZERO EMISSION MOBILITY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES AT LEAST A HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CLEAN MOBILITY OPTIONS PROJECT. AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND EXISTING CARD CARSHARE PILOTS. HOUSE INCLUDES AT LEAST A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CLEAN MOBILITY IN SCHOOLS PROJECTS. THE COMMITTEE HAD SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR CARP ABOUT THE PROPOSAL LET ME JUST RUN THROUGH THOSE NOW. THE FIRST WAS WIDE ONLY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS DEDICATED THEIR DISTRICTS WITH CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAMS. AND IT WHAT ONE EPISODES IS THAT THE DOWN PAYMENT TO THE DISTRICT PROGRAMS ADICIONAL SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IS ALSO PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET FROM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. FOR EQUITY TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. NONE OF THE PREPARATION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED- THE PROGRAMS YET. BUT A LARGE PORTION OF THE GIRAFFE ALLOCATION HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS DISTRICT RUN PROGRAMS IT'S LIKELY THIS FUNDING WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM. SO THAT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ALLOCATIONS FIVE THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TO TWO WHICH EXCEEDS THE STORK MAXIMUM OF THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DISTRICT'S. SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT APPROVED SUBSCRIPTION OF CARS FOR ALL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY OVER SUBSCRIBED IN SAN JOAQUIN SOUTH COASTIN THE AREA- DISTRICTS THERE'S REALLY STRONG DEMAND. FINALLY YOU ASKED ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE E. BIKE PROGRAM. SELECTRIC BICYCLE INCENTIVES PROJECT- ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES WAS ENACTED BY KARBI APPROVAL OF OUR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INCENTIVES. FUNDING PLAN AND EMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SIX HUNDRED. AND HIS FACE HAVING TO PAY. ADMIN IN PLACE IN MIDDLE EAST TWENTY TWO. AT THE SOLICITOR. CALL IN MAY. AND THE WINNER OF THE SOLICITATION TO ADMINISTER IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN JUNE. THANK YOU HAPPY ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS INAPPROPRIATE WILL TURN OVER TO MY CC COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS HANNIBAL AND I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FIELD AND TRANSPORTATION ABATEMENT AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO PUT IN A BID TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION I'M VERY MUCH A VEHICLE THAT PERFECT- THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE CONTINUE TO BE A LEADING BARRIER TO THE ADOPTION. WE'RE FULLY COMMITTED TO OVERCOMING THAT BARRIER THROUGH LONG TERM PLANNING AND PRIVATELY TO DEPLOY INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE WE NEED TO TACKLE. WE MUST APPOINT INFRASTRUCTURE NOW FOR THE DRIVERS HAVE A PLACE TO FEEL THE VEHICLE. EVEN AFTER PROJECT HAVE BEEN AWARDED FUNDING IT TAKES TIME TO CONDUCT SITE DESIGN CONSTRUCTION AND- AND ORGANIZATION. OF THE CARTON FICTION. AFTER THE BATSMAN WHAT STARK AND A LOT OF MAKING ABOUT IN LUBBOCK PRIVATE ALL. ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION LOCKED. WE LOOK AT IT UP TO DATE BUCKETS THREE HUNDRED NO TOWARD. VEHICLE AFTER TRUCKER SPOKE A LOT CREEK ANTI. IN TWO HUNDRED ML TOWARD MEDIUM TO HEAVY DUTY UNDER. AGAIN BOTH A LOT AND HIGH IN THERE TO. BUILD FUND HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO PRIVATE. WILL BE USED FOR. ON ONE THING THAT BEARD THIS YEAR IT INCLUDES- THAT WE HAVE. BETTER OVER SUBSCRIBING OUT OF TO THOSE. IN VEHICLE SUCH A- HI MILES VEHICLE THANK. RURAL KING. AND MULTIMEDIA DWELLING. WHO ALL FINISHED THERE FOR TAKING THE STAND UP TO NEW BLOCK GRANTS. SO THEY ADDITIONAL FUNDING. ALL THE ALL IT'LL HELP WITH PROVIDE REALLY MARKET NO ALSO LOT OF TWO MORE ROAD. PLAN CREATE CERTAINTY THE THIRD FUNDING HOW PLAN BUT THE CASE THAT ADDRESS GOT. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THAT CONCLUDES SARAH YOUR PRESENTATION IS ALEJO HAVE COMMENTS YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL TO ACCELERATE THE FUNDING- BECAUSE IN OUR VIEW THE BENEFITS OF DOING SO ARE UNCLEAR AND- THAT COULD HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON FUTURE BUDGET FLEXIBILITY NO I'M GOING TO KIND OF RUN THROUGH ALL OF THOSE PIECES REAL QUICKLY. THE FIRST ON THE BENEFIT SIDE WE THINK THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE ACCELERATOR ON CLEARER- JUST TO KIND OF REITERATE I THINK SOMETHING YOU ALREADY HEARD AND AS I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER THE GOVERNOR AS PART OF THIS YEAR JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSED A TEN BILLION DOLLARS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FUNDING PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDED FUNDING THAT WAS AGREED UPON LAST YEAR AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. IN JANUARY AND THAT WOULD A BID BY. I LEVELS OF FUNDING FOR LOT OF THESE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. AND THE FUNNY WOULD BE SPREAD OUT OVER A MULTI YEAR A FIVE YEAR PERIOD REALLY- THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ACCELERATE A PORTION OF THAT FUNDING ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION- INTO THE CURRENT YEAR- WE THINK THAT- IF ACCELERATED IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THERE IS. SUFFICIENT DEMAND FOR AND OF ALL THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IN THE NEAR TERM AND OR ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT. THE PROJECTS MORE QUICKLY THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE OCCURRED UNDER KIND OF A MULTI YEAR FUNDING APPROACH. AND SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T PROVIDED ANY SPECIFIC ESTIMATES OF HOW THE PROPOSAL WOULD ACTUALLY SORT OF SPEED UP THE DEPLOYMENT OF. OF PROJECTS WITH R. P. TRUCKING STATIONS OR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT THE BENEFIT SIDE ON IN TERMS OF KIND OF SOME OF THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL REDUCES SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE'S FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUST. FUTURE BUDGET ALLOCATIONS IN RESPONSE TO UNEXPECTED BUDGETARY AND POLICY CHANGES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF GENERAL FUND REVENUES DECREASED DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IN THE COMING YEARS THE LEGISLATURE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND BY. ADJUSTING SOME OF THESE- THAT SPENDING. LEVELS IN FUTURE BUDGETS- ALSO IF THERE'S AN INCREASE IN SAID FUNDING FROM OTHER SOURCES FOR EXAMPLE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR. SOME OF THE SIMILAR THAT ACTIVITIES THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE. A SEAT AT ITS ABILITY TO ADJUST IT'S A SECONDLY YOU WE THINK THE PROPOSAL REDUCE LEGISLATORS ABILITY TO EXERCISE ITS OVERSIGHT ROLE SO FOR EXAMPLE. UNDER THE ORIGINAL MULTI YEAR APPROACH THAT WAS PROPOSED. IF FUTURE OVERSIGHT EFFORTS DETERMINED THAT DEPARTMENTS AREN'T IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS AFFECTED WITH THE LEGISLATURE COULD WITHHOLD FUNDING UNTIL THE ADMINISTRATION CAN SHOW THAT IT HAS MADE IMPROVEMENTS- HOWEVER UNDER THIS KIND OF ACCELERATION PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE WOULD FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO EMPLOY THOSE. THOSE OVERSIGHT TOOLS IN THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE SOME OF THE PUBLIC CONTRACTING EXEMPTIONS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD REDUCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIRD PARTY OVERSIGHT. FROM DDS- THAT ARE MEANT TO ENSURE THE STATE FUNDS ARE. ARE BEING SPENT RESPONSIBLY. SO JUST TO WRAP UP GIVEN SOME OF THE UNCLEAR BENEFITS AND SOME OF THE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON A BUDGET FLEXIBILITY IN OVERSIGHT WERE. I RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECTED SPUR. THANK YOU- YOUR TAKE A STAB AT- RESPOND AS SOME OF THOSE- CRITICS SIDE ABSOLUTELY I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. I WILL NOT SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PRIORITIES BUT I CAN'T SAY THESE PROGRAMS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT SO WHEN IT COMES TO YOU CAN THIS FUNDS TO BE SPENT. THAT I CAN ATTEST TO I'M IN BOTH THE CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM AND THE ABILITY OPTIONS PROGRAMS WE'VE REGULARLY SEEN DEMANDS WELL EXCEEDING SUPPLY- WHICH CAUSES THE SERVICE START STOP. AFFECT IN THE PROGRAM. IT ALSO MAKES IT HARDER TO PLAN FOR LONG TERM PERMANENT PLANTATION ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE FINANCING PROGRAM. WHERE WE CONSISTENTLY SEE THAT OPEN AND CLOSE AND NOW THE VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF ALLOCATION I THINK FIFTEEN MILLION FOR IT. SO PROVIDING SOME OF THESE AND SOME OF THESE AREAS WHETHER IT'S IN THE MOBILITY PROGRAM THROUGH LASSEN MISS PAL THESE PLAN AND OF THE FULL SCOPE OF PLANNING. WE'RE CONSISTENTLY SEE MANY MORE APPLICATIONS THAT WE CAN FIND. WHEN THE FINANCING YOUR CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAMS WE ALSO TEND TO SEE A SIMILAR EFFECT. SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEE SHOULD THE SOME PROPOSAL FORWARD. WITH AN ABILITY MORE LONG TERM PLANNING I PROVIDE MORE CERTAINTY BOTH TO MANUFACTURE SENTIMENTS POLITIES YOU LOOK AT DO YOU TO THE- ISSUE OF REDUCING LEGISLATIVE ATTEMPTS RE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT UP FOR TO MY FINANCE COLLEAGUES FOR THAT YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO- THE IN SHINS AT STANDARDIZED AND WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MAINTAIN THAT THEIR SON OVERSIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAINTAINS OUR WHILE THESE DOLLARS ARE BEING ROLLED OUT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER BENNETT. A AND WALDRON. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE- SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND FOR THE V. CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE- I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE OUT OF EVERYTHING I. CERTAINLY RESPECT THE CONCERNS OF LA- TO THE EXTENT THAT WEEK XCELERATED DOES- I WOULD HOPE THAT WE- PUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BONUS POINTS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE STORAGE CAPACITY AS PART OF THOSE- WITH THE GRID OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE PROTECTED BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THAT IS TO INCREASE STORAGE AND HAVE PEOPLE USING THE GRID- DURING THE OFF HOURS AND THEN USING THEIR STORAGE. TO HELP US- DURING THOSE TIME PERIODS AND STUFF SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE THAT OR BEEN PRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE THAT. TWO AREAS THAT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT FROM AN OVERSIGHT STANDPOINT THAT I THINK COULD TO A ROAD PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT AND WE'VE HAD UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY HITS LIKE THAT WITH STUFF. SOME OF THE OTHER CRISIS THAT WE'VE HAD BUT- THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE WITH- THE CLEAN CARS PROGRAM- ANYTIME THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FUNDS- FOR UP TO A PUSH. A SPECIFIC POPULATION I'M NOT SAYING DON'T DO IT I'M SAYING THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE GOOD OVERSIGHT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO ABUSING THOSE PROGRAMS MANIPULATING THE- OF THE DATA CENTER TO GET THE GRANTS. AND THEN THE GOING TO A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTING- THE EXPLORATION OF THAT- LANGUAGE OF THAT- GENERAL SERVICES SHE IS NOT TO REVIEWING AS WERE TRYING. THINGS SO. AND SO THE TEMPERATURE TO GET INCREASE FLEX- PUTS US AT AT RISK TERMS SOURCE OF MONEY TO GET TO RACIAL SINGS HERE TODAY- HOPE THAT IF WE DO GO THOSE DOES DIRECTION SO WE PUT A SIGNIFICANT ENERGY INTO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND CONFIDENCE- WITH THOSE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR TRUMP. I THINK IT WAS CHAIR I WANTED TO- GET INTEL A LITTLE MORE DETAIL EAST YOU SAID THAT THE ATTENDANCE IS TO THE- THE CC. BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL NUMBERS YOU CAN YOU CAN DEMONSTRATION DOCUMENT THE DEMAND LIKE YOU SAID THEY'RE OVERSUBSCRIBED OVERSUBSCRIBED BY HOW MUCH. THE PROGRAM IS. BUT THOSE ARE NOT THE I'M SORRY I WOULD MAYBE DO YOU WHICH ARE TO DEMONSTRATION. I BELIEVE YOU'RE A REFERENCING THE COMMENT CARB BECAUSE ABOUT THE OVER SUBSCRIPTION IN THE CERTAIN AREAS IS THAT YEAH I APOLOGIZE I I'M I'M READING THAT AND- ASKING THAT THE L. A. ELSE IS THAT EXHILARATING THE FUNDING- WOULDN'T REALLY CHANGING THE TIME AS THE KEY PROGRAMS AND- AND I THINK THE CHAIR ASKED- HOW TO RESPOND AND I THINK I. THE SAID- THE PROJECT AT THE WRONG AGENCY- THAT THAT ITS OVER SUBSCRIBED BUT BY HOW MUCH I GET THEIR NUMBERS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUY A FEW EXAMPLES. IN MOBILITY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE THE- THE COMMUNITY BUILDING PROGRAMS PROPOSED FOR PATIENTS. AS THOSE WINDOWS THAT OPEN FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS HE RECEIVED ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSALS WE ARE ABLE TO FIND ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THIS. FOR THE STATE WITH FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND WE EXPECT ON THE ORDER FIFTY FIVE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OF ANNUAL DEMAND. THAT PROGRAM START UP HAS BEEN SLOWED BY THE PANDEMIC I THINK THAT' PROBABLY REPRESENTATIVE CONSIDERING THAT'S THE ONLY A WAY TO FINANCING OPTION. BROOKLYN CARS FOR ALL AND WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OVER SUBSCRIPTION. IN MANY OF THE- THE DISTRICTS THE COURT ADMINISTER THEM. FOR INSTANCE WE BELIEVE THE SANDWICH ERDAS IS DOWN ABOUT FIFTY MILLION. AND THERE AND THE OTHERS ARE EITHER WRITING RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE WITH MANY MORE APPLICATIONS COMING IN. OR SLIGHTLY DOWN. I'M TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT- OVERALL. SPEND RATES YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE LAST YEAR'S ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ENCUMBERED. HOW MUCH IS ALREADY BEING SPENT IN EXPECT GREATER DEMAND. IN ALL THESE PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD AS WE SEE THIS RELEASED SHARP PIVOT TOWARD ELECTRIFICATION- MEANING THAT. AS THE STATE MOVES INTO THAT AREA. WITH RIGOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT'S POINTS WITH CONSIDERABLE AUDIT AND COMPARE EDUCATION. WE ARE AWARE THAT THERE ARE LARGE NUMBER OF MIDDLE CLASS AND LOW INCOME SOUTH KOREANS WHO NEED THESE TOOLS. SOME OF THESE AREAS WE DO SEE STRONG DEMAND. EXACTLY HOW THAT THE BAND PLAYED OUT OF COURSE IS SUBJECT TO WHERE THE MARKET GOES. SO IS SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT LA WAS WRONG. NO I AM NOT SPEAKING VALUES PARTICULAR CRITIQUES I AM SAYING THAT THE STRONG DEMAND FOR THESE PROGRAMS TRYING I GUESS MAYBE TO THE L. A. I'M TRYING TO WAY. TO MEET WITH FROM YOUR ANALYSIS EVEN A KID THAT- THAT THERE REALLY IS NO ESTIMATES AT THE MOMENT OF HOW THE EXHILARATED FUNDING WOULD CHANGE THE TIME LINES FOR KEY PROGRAM OUTCOMES. I MADE WHAT WHAT WHAT DETAILS WHAT NUMBERS ARE YOU UTILIZING A YOUR NUMBERS ALIGNING. YEAH AND SO I THINK OUR COMMENTS WERE. ALONG THE LINES OF THAT IT WAS UNCLEAR AT THE TIME THAT WE DID OUR ANALYSIS AND- WE DIDN'T HAVE THE NUMBERS THAT WERE JUST PRESENTED RIGHT HERE IN THE HEARING AND SO I THINK HAVING THAT INFORMATION. COULD HELP SORT OF CLARIFY AND PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AROUND WHAT THOSE BENEFITS. MIGHT BE AMENABLE NOTES- AGAIN SORT OF THE A FUNDING FROM PRIOR YEARS IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT WOULD HAVE KIND OF BEEN PROPOSED GOING FORWARD GIVEN SOME OF THE DISCUSSION. AROUND OF THIS OUT BUDGET SO I THINK. SENSE OF. YOU KNOW HOW DEMAND COMPARED TO WHAT FUNDING WOULD GO KIND OF UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS KIND OF IMPORTANT- PIECE OF THAT DISCUSSION I THINK HAVING THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AROUND KIND OF HOW THOSE LOCKED UP AND WHAT. EXACTLY WOULD BE ACCELERATED AS A RESULT OF THIS PROPOSAL COULD. HELP INFORM THAT DECISION WHICH WOULD THEN I THINK MAYBE- AS YOU'RE GETTING TO KIND OF HELP INFORM HOW TO BALANCE. YOU KNOW WHAT HOW HOW MUCH MORE QUICKLY SO PLEASE PROJECT WOULD BE EMPTY. THE OTHER. ACCOUNT AND ARE NOT. I WOULD TO THAT DAY NOW THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND OF COURSE- THAT'S WHY HOLD THESE ITEMS OPENNESS THAT WE CAN RECEIVE THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND- EVALUATE TO. MORE CAREFULLY- WHAT THE APPROPRIATE- DIRECTION AS- FOR OUR FOR MY PART I WOULD SAY. THE ACCELERATION OF THESE FUNDS IS GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL IF IT ACTUALLY GETS OUT ON THE STREET AND RESULTS. IN MORE CLEAN VEHICLES. REPLACING A DIRTY VEHICLES BECAUSE- THE LONGER EIGHTY- CARBON PRODUCING VEHICLE IS OFF THE ROAD- AND CONVERSELY A CLEAN VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. THE MORE BENEFIT WE GET FROM IT GOING FORWARD SO IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR US TO ACHIEVE. THAT BENEFIT TO IT AND IT'S TWO OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS FROM NOW AND I. THINK THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO IT A CHEATER BY. ACCELERATING THE FUNDING- IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION IF THESE PROGRAMS. ARE OVER SAYS SUCH RIGHT NOW. AND WE SPEND OUR THIS MY- IN THE NEAR TERM WILL THERE BE FUNDING IN THE FUTURE. TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAMS THERE'S- CERTAINLY SOME UNCERTAINTY THERE BUT- I CAN SEE THE BENEFIT OF. SPENDING THE MONEY NOW- A BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE RECEIVING TODAY. WITH THAT IF THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND MOVE ON TO OUR- LAST TO WIN MORE PRINT.
