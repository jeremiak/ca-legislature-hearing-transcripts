ON ANY PROPOSALS SO WITH THAT -- WELCOME EVERYONE HERE AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN A WITH THAT THE FARM SOCIAL SERVICES COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING. AND SO WE AN HAVE THE AGENCY IN LA -- IN. FINANCE PLEASE COME UP. CAN I JUST MAKE MENTION THAT -- ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT -- STAFF. REPORTS TO SELL WHAT WE WANT TO USE FOCUS -- FOR THE VERVIEW ON THE HIGHLIGHTS I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT STUFF -- AND LOT OF THINGS COVERED BY COMMUNICATOR LICENSING -- BUT BEFORE AD ALSO BEFORE BEGIN WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND HAVE EVERYONE INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO THE RECORDS ALL STAR THE AGENCY. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS POUNDED FUSS DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING THANK YOU. ACTING DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HELLO JACKIE BRASILIA. MARKET IN LA -- HE FINANCE. JUST INTRODUCED A FROM THE FINANCE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO WE'LL GO AHEAD WITH ISSUE ONE WHICH IS THE OVERVIEW THAT THE OF COMMITTEE CARE LICENSING. OKAY ALL START WITH THE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE OVER THE PAST YEAR -- I WANT TO SAY BEFORE I BEGIN THAT WE'VE REFOCUSED OUR MODEL ON MORE OF THE PREVENTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT GOING FROM STRICTLY ENFORCEMENT SO A LOT OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE ARE GEARED TOWARDS THAT. SO WE MET OUR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS -- FOR IN FOR INSPECTIONS ADULTS SENIOR CARE REST EVERY TWO YEARS AND AND CHILD CARE EVERY. THREE SO WE MET THAT WE DID APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND INSPECTIONS -- WE'VE ALSO BEGAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR INSPECTION TOOLS WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR SO WERE WERE INTO THAT PROCESS -- WE'VE DONE A PILOT -- FOR ADULT FOR THE SENIOR CARE WHICH ALL PROVIDE MORE IN YOUR SECOND QUESTION -- AND R. L. P. A.'S HAVE ADDRESSED EVERY FOR EVERY FACILITY THAT WAS IMPACTED BY THE FIRES AND FLOODS THAT TOOK A LOT OF OUR TIME THIS YEAR WE'VE. WE BUILT A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH CALLOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROVIDERS THAT IS ABLE TO PROVIDE REAL TIME AVAILABLE BEDS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY TRANSFER RESIDENTS FROM ADULTS SENIOR CARE FACILITIES. TO THESE OF AVAILABLE BEDS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE SHELTERS -- SO WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL ON THAT. WE HAVE -- REALLY EMBELLISHED OUR TRAINING IN THE PROGRAM WE'VE CHANGED OUR LPA ACADEMY THAT USED TO BE DEATH BY POWER POINT ON AND IT'S NOW UTILIZES BEST PRACTICES AN ADULT LEARNING. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE CORE COMPETENCIES AND STATUTES SO IT'S A MUCH MORE THEY'RE MUCH MORE PREPARED FOR THIS JOB. AND IN ALL THREE PROGRAMS THAT DON'T SENIOR CARE CHILD CARE IN CHILDREN'S ROSE WE'VE HELD SYMPOSIUMS TO BUT TO PROVIDE BEST SPECIFIC TRAINING WE DID A MENTAL HEALTH SYMPOSIUM WHERE WE HAD DR -- CONDITIONAL FROM UCSF THAT CAME AND TALKED ABOUT BEST PRACTICES IN AND MENTAL HEALTH WE DID A CLINICAL HEALTH SYMPOSIUM ABOUT FALL PREVENTION IN OUR FACILITIES -- AND WE ALSO DID A TRAUMA INFORMED CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL FACILITY FOR OUR OUR STAFF TO BE TRAINED ON THAT AS WELL AS PRINT PARENTING. AND THEN -- FOR CHILD CARE WE DID SUPPORTING CHILDREN WITH CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR SO WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY EMBELLISHMENT AND HAVE OUR STAFF BE MORE AMBASSADORS OF CHANGE TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE PREVENTION IN THESE AREAS IN THE FACILITIES WHERE THEY'RE HAVING STRUGGLING -- AND LASTLY WE HAVE WE ARE TRAINING ON DE ESCALATION WE HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THAT'S ALSO A SOCIAL WORKER THAT IS TRAINING ALL OF UR STAFF BECAUSE THEY GET INTO VERY -- EMOTIONAL SITUATIONS HOW TO DE ESCALATE THE SITUATION SO WE FOCUSED ON THAT -- OUR WEBSITE ALL OF OUR REPORTS ARE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE THE TRANSPARENCY WEBSITE FOR BOTH COMPLAIN INVESTIGATIONS AND INSPECTIONS. SO WE HAVE -- DONE A REVAMP OF HOW THEY DOCUMENTS CALL PRINCIPLES OF DOCUMENTATION SO THAT THEIR DOCUMENTED IN A STANDARD FASHION SO IT'S MORE UNDERSTANDABLE TO THE PUBLIC. ON YOU KNOW WHAT VIOLATION HAS pTHAT WERE ALSO DOING VIDEO TRAINING THAT -- ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF VIDEO TRAINING AS HAND OVER HAND -- ASSISTANCE WITH SELF ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICATION BECAUSE OUR ARMED CARE GIVERS AREN'T ALLOWED TO TO GIVE MEDICATION BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A RESIDENT WITH. PARKINSON'S OR SOMETHING THERE IS A METHOD THAT YOU CAN DO HAND OVER HAND TO ASSIST THE WE'VE GOT VIDEOS ONLINE FOR OUR PROVIDERS -- SO THAT THAT SOME OF WHAT WE'VE DONE -- AND TO GO INTO OUR CHALLENGES IS IT'S A IT'S A COMPLICATED -- BALANCING ACT IN OUR AND OUR FACIL IN OUR REGIONAL OFFICES WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN REGIONAL OFFICES AND THEY CONTINUALLY ADD TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR INSPECTIONS. WE GET THOUSANDS OF OF INCIDENT REPORTS DAILY THEY NEED TO LOOK AT AS WELL AS COMPLAINTS THAT COME IN SO THEY'VE OT TO RE PRIORITIZE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE THEY NEED TO REALLY GET OUT TO THAT FACILITY AND CHANGE THEIR WHOLE. ITINERARY SO AND THEN WITH THE THE EMERGENCIES WITH THE FIRES AND FLOODS THEY SPENT WEEKS OUT YOU KNOW ASSISTING THE RESIDENTS MAKING SURE THEY'RE OKAY IN THE RE LOCATIONS AND SO IT'S THAT CONSTANT BALANCING ACT OF WE DID ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED CLOSURES LAST YEAR -- REVOCATIONS OF FOR NON COMPLIANCE -- AND SO WERE WERE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE PREVENTION ASPECT TO TRY TO GET AHEAD OF THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE THINK THIS TOOL THIS GONNA HELP US IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS -- THEN THEN WE'VE GOT -- THE VACANCY ISSUE WITH OUR L. P. A.'S THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR US IT'S A IT'S JUST A CONSTANT -- CHURNING OF STAFF THE JOBS VERY DEMANDING THEIR CASE LOW THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES TO BE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK -- TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF THERE'S PROBLEMS THEY'RE THERE -- AND SO SOME STAFF JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT THEIR THEIR LOW PAYING JOBS THERE BELOW THE A. T. P. A.'S THAT IS THAT THAT STANDARD ANALYST POSITION IN THE STATE THEIR TOP SALARY IS THE LOWEST. OF THE EIGHT GPA SO THERE'S YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO KEEP THEM -- ON STAFF -- THEN WE'VE BEEN -- WE HAVE THE COMPLAINT BACKLOG THAT SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS THE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN GOING UP BUT WE'VE BEEN KEEPING UP WITH THE INCREASE OF COMPLAINTS OVER NINETY DAYS. BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HAD ABOUT. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND THE BACKLOG WE'RE DOWN TO ABOUT CLOSE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED OVER NINETY DAYS SO WE'RE WE'RE CHUNKING AWAY AT THE BACKLOG AS WE CAN YOU KNOW BASED ON THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. AND LASTLY WE HAVE AN OUTDATED LEGACY SYSTEM THAT IS A CHALLENGE FOR US YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THAT THE L. PA'S WILL BE OUT ON INSPECTION AND THE COMPUTER WILL JUST GO INTO A CONSISTENCY CHECK FOR LIKE AN HOUR TO TWO HOURS BEFORE THEY CAN CONTINUE WITH THEIR COMPLETING THEIR REPORTS. SO WE RELY ON LOTUS NOTES AND WE'RE WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN NINE HOURS OF THE BEST WE CAN TO KEEP IT TOGETHER SO -- THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. OKAY WHAT DO I JUST CONTINUE ON WITH THE THE OTHER TWO QUESTIONS AS WELL OKAY SO -- AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE INSPECTION PROCESS -- I DO HAVE A MORE COMPLETE POWER POINT THAT I AM. THAT YOU CAN BE PRESENTED THAT HAS MORE OF THE DETAIL TO IT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE DID A PILOT FOR THE SENIOR CARE WE DID TWO HUNDRED INSPECTIONS -- AND SO NOW WE'RE GOING OVER THE ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW WE'VE HIRED SACKS STATE TO ASSIST US WITH SOME ABOUT ANALYSIS -- AND THE THE THE TOOLS ARE BUILT ON DOMAIN SO IT'S WE NEVER HAD A COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION. PACKET BEFORE A TOOL FOR THE L. P. A.'S USE SO THEY ALL USED THEIR OWN NAMES THEY MADE THEIR OWN UP SO NOW WE HAVE A STANDARD. ANNEKE IT HAS BUILT ON DOMAINS LIKE RESIDENT RIGHTS MEDICATIONS THEM BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS AND SO IT'S MORE OF A YOU CAN GET A WHOLE PULSE OF THE FACILITY WHETHER IT'S IN THEIR INCOME SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE SO -- THAT WE GOT A LOT OF DATA OUT OF THE THE COMPREHENSIVE TOOL SO WITH THAT TOOL WE'RE TAKING THAT THAT THE DATA AND WE'RE BUILDING THE STANDARD TO WHICH IS GOING TO REPLACE THE CAT -- AND SO I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN MY THIRD QUESTION SO WERE -- ALL THREE PROGRAMS THE CHILD CARE IN CHILDREN'S ROSE HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR TOOLS AND SO WE'RE GETTING PREPARED TO DO THEIR PILOTS BECAUSE WE'RE DOING PILOTS FOR MOST OF THE FACILITY TYPES BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SPECIFIC. TOOLS FOR EACH FACILITY TYPE. AND SO YOU'RE ASKING HOW THE INSPECTION PROCESS WILL BE MEASURED -- WILL MEASURE IT BY -- THE CLOSURES AND THIS IS GONNA BE A NEW BASELINE FOR US BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD WE WEREN'T ABLE TO COLLECT DATA WITH THE KIT AND SO. WITH THESE NEW TOOLS WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO COLLECT OUR BASELINE DATA AND THE MEASURE BY CLOSURES BY COMPLIANCE ISSUES BY NUMBER OF CITATIONS. THE TOOL ALSO HAS BUILT IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHICH DIDN'T HAVE AND THE OTHER TOOL AND IT'S MORE OF AN INTER OF PROCESS SO THE KID DIDN'T ALLOW YOU TO UPDATE IT AS YOU GOT NEW LAWS. ENACTED SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A EXTRA PIECE OF PAPER WRITE IT DOWN AND SAY I NEED TO CHECK FOR LIABILITY INSURANCE OR WHATEVER. THIS IS THE INTERIM PROCESS WILL BE CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WE UPDATED AS NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS ARE IN PLACE SO WE WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT THIS IS GOING TO HELP BUT THE PREVENTION SIDE OF ITS VERY TRANSPARENT WE HAVE IT ON OUR WEBSITE SO. PROVIDERS CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE WHOLE TOOL AND SAY THESE ARE ALL THE REGULATIONS WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AND ACTUALLY USE THAT AS A TRAINING INSTRUMENT. YOU MAY GO TO THE THIRD OKAY THE THIRD QUESTION OF A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE KIT. TOOL AND DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE NEW TOOLS WILL BE VALIDATED. SO THE KIDS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BASED ON SOUND RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF CHILD CARE THEY WERE REALLY. UTILIZE DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT CUTS OF RESOURCES DURING THE RECESSION AND SO -- IF THEY WEREN'T A GOOD INDICATOR OF A HEALTHY FACILITY AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT I FOUND ONE AFTER I TOOK THIS JOB FIVE YEARS AGO THAT WHY ARE WE DOING INSPECTIONS THE YEAR TWO YET LATER WERE FINDING THESE COMPLIANCE ISSUES THAT WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY. SO -- SO THAT'S WHERE WE START TALKING ABOUT THE NEW TOOL OR YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT A WHOLE COMPENDIUM OF THE REGULATIONS AT EVERY PART OF IT NOT JUST A FEW PIECES LIKE WE HAD ON THE CAT -- SO -- HOW WE'RE GONNA VALIDATED AGAIN IS IS BASICALLY -- THE POST INSPECTION LICENSING SERVICE WHEN WE DID THAT THE PILOTS WE ACTUALLY LEAVE A SURVEY FOR THE LICENSEE AND THE LPA TO FILL OUT WE'VE GOT FEEDBACK FROM THEM WE HAD FOCUS GROUPS AFTERWARDS -- THE INTER RATER RELIABILITY WE HAD -- MANAGERS THAT WENT ON SITE TO DO IN A RATER RELIABILITY WE ROUTE AVERAGE THEY TELL US YOU NEED TO GET ABOVE THAT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT A LITTLE BIT HIGHER -- SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TO ACTUALLY MEASURE IF IT THIS IS DOING A GOOD JOB AT AND ALSO LOOKING AT OTHER STATES MESSAGE. THANK YOU -- COMES FROM ILIO FINANCE. NO COMMENTS FOR MILLIONS OF OKAY. QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY -- SO I ACTUALLY DID WANT TO JUST -- TOUCH BASE A LITTLE BIT ON SO FIRST OF ALL I GUESS. HOW'S YOUR STAFFING. AREN'T YOU YEAH WE DO TALK ABOUT CUTS IN RECESSION WE NOW DID SO -- THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW JERRY TROUBLE RETAINING CERTAIN POSITIONS BECAUSE THE PAY IS LOW. SO CAN YOU WRITE TO WELL WE HAVE -- REALLY TRIED -- TO DO A GOOD JOB OF PROVIDING MORE TRAINING SO THAT THE THE THE LPA IS WHEN THEY GO OUT ON THE JOB THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE OUT THERE ON THEIR OWN AND THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY CAN BE. DANGEROUS SITUATION WE'VE HAD TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SO THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS HOW TO DE ESCALATE WHAT TO DO IN THESE TYPE OF SITUATIONS WE HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR LICENSEES SO WE'RE TRYING TO RETAIN OUR STOP. YES A TOW IT SO ARE WE HAVING PROBLEMS LOTS WITH VACANCIES ARE ARE YOU ABLE TO SELL YOUR POSITIONS WERE WERE ABOUT 8% VACANCY RATE RIGHT NOW WHAT PERCENTAGE 8%. AND WE HAVE ABOUT CLOSE. TO ABOUT. HUNDRED POSITIONS AND HOW THAT COMPARES WELL AS A HISTORICALLY I GUESS BEFORE THE RECESSION IS I MEAN THAT. IS YOUR NO IT'S MUCH BETTER. SINCE THE RECESSION WE'VE WE'VE RECEIVED SEVERAL POSITIONS YES OKAY AND AND YOU'RE ABLE. TO THAT DATE PERCENT VACANCY RATE STILL HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO WHOM WELL. OKAY OKAY I I KNOW FINANCES BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU HAVE TO SAY YES IT'S FINE. I WILL DO ON THE SIDE. MOST OF WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WITH CURRENT STAFF THAT WE ALREADY HAD THAT -- IS ACTUALLY HAS THEIR OWN FULL JOB DUTIES LIKE THE TOOLS ALL OF THAT IS ON TOP OF OUR REGULAR THEIR REGULAR JOBS SO -- ESCALATE -- HAVE YOU HAVE YOU. HAVE YOU DID YOU LOOK AT THAT ISSUE AND THIS ISSUE -- ISSUE VACANCY HAS BEEN SOME OF DISCUSSED ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF CCL I THINK ESPECIALLY -- AS PA AS LAWS CHANGING POLICIES CHANGE THAT REQUIRE MORE FREQUENT INSPECTIONS -- THIS ISSUE OF A FOR READY HAVING AN ISSUE WITH RETENTION AND VACANCY HOW THEN DO YOU BUILD UPON THAT. TO INCREASED FREQUENCY AN INSPECTION. FOR YEARS SO YOU LOOK AT THIS TOO RIGHT AND SO. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON ON DO YOU HAVE CAN STEER DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS BASED ON THE NUMBERS YOU LOOK THAT RELATE TO THIS AGENCY. I'M NOT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE OVERVIEW BUT IN GENERAL THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES RAISED ABOUT -- FOR NUMBER FACILITIES TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE FOR INSPECTIONS -- FOR FOR FREQUENCY OF INSPECTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO RAMP UP WHICH SOME ARE -- IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUT ALSO IN FUTURE YEARS THE QUESTION OF ARE WE THAT ARE DO WE HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO SUPPORT THAT RAMP UP THOSE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN MONITORING AND TRACKING. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT THAT CERTAINLY IMPORTANT SO YOU KNOW NUMBER POSITIONS HOW MANY VACANCIES BECAUSE IT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO WOULD DO THE WORK OKAY. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE KEEP YES IT WAS A MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PAT KELLY REACTING DIRECTOR -- THE ONE THING I JUST WANT TO STRESS IS THAT HIRING AND RETENTION OF STAFF IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY IN CCL SO AS MISTER PROSS WAS OUTLINING SORT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT -- IT IS A VERY LARGE POPULATION AND WE THERE IS ONGOING WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT FOLKS ARE HAVING TO STEP IN AND DO SO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING INNOVATIVE AND AND DIFFERENTLY. WE POSSIBLY CAN TO HIRE AS MANY QUALIFIED STAFF AS WE POSSIBLY CAN AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER OUT -- WE THIS THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN -- AND AN ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN BOTH VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ADDING RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INFLUX TO REALLY TRY AND CHANGE THE DIVISION. CHANGE THE CULTURE THAT'S REFLECTED IN MANY OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT YOU HEARD -- BUT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DAY -- HIGH PRIORITY TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE HIRING EVERY SINGLE AUTHORIZED POSITION THAT WE HAVE OKAY WISEMAN BE SURE WE'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT -- BECAUSE I THINK AGAIN THIS THEM FOR IMPORT ROLE AND I KNOW THAT. PASSED HEARINGS YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. RELATIONS SOME OF THEM FRANKLY TO TRY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO YOU KNOW -- TO DECREASE THE SUR WORKLOAD RIGHT -- AND DOWN TO EXAMPLES OF AND THAT IN ITSELF IS IN THIS REALLY BAD BUT I THINK IT'S RAISE SOME CONCERN WHETHER. SOME OF THE STEPS WERE TAKING NO MIGHT CAUSE MORE THINGS TO GET MISTER SOMETHING SO -- FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE WORD AND THE UNIT. BUT TO APPRECIATE SIMPLY LOOK AT THE MAINS AND THEN YOU MIGHT LOOK AT ONE MEASURE TO REFLECT THAT DOMAIN. AND BUY THINGS YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON IS OUR PEOPLE THIS WAS A PEOPLE ARE VERY SMART INTO THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE TEST QUESTIONS ARE YOU YOU PREPARE FOR THE TEST. BUT THAT DOESN'T AND WHILE WE TRY TO DESIGN A TEST SO THAT THIS WAS QUESTIONS REFLECT THE LARGER THING RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TO ASK FOR IT WE ASK QUESTIONS ON EVERY SINGLE THING YOU WOULD BE A REALLY REALLY. BIG LONG EXPENSIVE TEST CENTER WILL BE SURE PEOPLE AREN'T GAMING THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT THE MARKER ACTUALLY DOES A MARKER STILL TRULY REFLECT OVER TIME -- THE ACTUAL FULL THE MAIN -- NOTS AND WRITING THAT JUST CONTINUALLY MONITOR AYE A TWO SURE THAT THAT'S AND THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING SORT OF PERVERSE INCENTIVES TO DO CERTAIN THINGS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MEASURING OTHER THINGS THAT WE DON'T MEASURE. WE ALSO TO KEEP AN EYE ON RIGHT. YES AND THAT'S WHY THIS TOOL IS IS SO DIFFERENT THAN THE KIT BECAUSE THERE'S THINGS WE DIDN'T MEASURE SO WE WILL OUR QUALITY ASSURANCE TEAM IS LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT AT THE THE DATUM THE CITATIONS RIGHT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY. SO I APPRECIATE THE UPDATE AS WE HAD THIS QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT WAS GOING AND WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THAT SO. I MEAN WE WANT TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE IN TERMS OF BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE BE INSPECTED SO FORTH AND BE SURE WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED. FOR PROTECTION SAFETY RIGHT YEAH OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. OKAY ANY OTHER. SINGLE OKAY WANNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO A DATA MIGRATION ISSUE NUMBER TWO THE C. P. FOR DATA MIGRATION FOR LEGACY SYSTEMS. FOR AGAIN CALORIE WITH DEPARTMENT -- ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STAFF HAVE THE TIME TO DO THE JOB THAT WERE TASKING THEM WITH. IS FOR IMPROVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE TO USE IN THE FIELD AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE ARE SYSTEMS THAT WE ARE USING. OUR WERE INVENTED DURING PAGER -- TIMES -- AND THEY ARE NOT WHAT ANYBODY AT THE TIME THEY WERE CUTTING EDGE THEY TRULY WERE WE USED TO HAVE L. P. A.'S WHO LITERALLY CARRIED IN THE TRUNK OF THEIR CAR BOXES FULL OF FORMS AND MANUALS. THAT THEY HAD TO BRING TO EVERY SINGLE CHILD CARE IN THE STATE SO THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT FORMS TO DO IT WE TOOK ALL THAT PAPER AND MADE IT A COMPUTER SYSTEM. WHICH IS HOW YOU USED TO DO THINGS FACT THAT IT IS NOT HOW WE WOULD BUILD A COMPUTER SYSTEM TODAY BUT WE STILL ARE TASKED WITH USING THIS LEGACY SYSTEMS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE SOME OVER THE YEARS. SO WE HAVE BEGUN EFFORTS TO REPLACE ALL OF THOSE SYSTEMS -- PART OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM CARES PROJECT INVOLVES -- THE LICENSING PORTION FOR CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL -- WE HAVE PLANNED AS THAT PROJECT HAS MOVED FORWARD THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL LICENSING. AND ALL OF OUR OTHER LICENSING PROGRAMS ARE DE MINIMUS -- SO WE'VE PLANNED EVENTUALLY TO USE THAT WHAT'S DEVELOPED IN THAT SYSTEM -- TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT FOR OTHER SYSTEMS BUT WE'RE STILL MANY YEARS AWAY FROM DOING THAT BECAUSE CHILDREN RESIDENTIAL IS A CENTRAL PART OF IT THESE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE IT -- AND SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR WAYS WE CAN IN THE INTERIM CREATE A STOPGAP SO THAT AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ONE ARE LPA GOES OUT TO A FACILITY TO DO -- AN INSPECTION OR COMPLAINT VISIT. FREQUENTLY OUR SYSTEMS -- WILL GLITCH AND YOU WILL GET A COT WHAT'S KNOWN AS A CONTINUITY CHECK WERE I I CALL IT THE LITTLE BLUE SPINNING WHEEL OF DEATH -- THAT HAPPENS THAT MIGHT OCCUR AS LONG AS AN HOUR. SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE TO SIT THERE AND NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER THINGS ON THE COMPUTER FOR SONGS THAT THAT'S AN HOUR THAT THEY ARE. DOING OTHER THINGS. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MOVING FORWARD WITH TRYINGTO FIND AN INTERIM SOLUTION -- TO GET OUR STAFF ON ALL MODERN PLATFORM WITH MODERN TOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN DO THINGS IN AN EFFICIENT WAY. IN AN INTUITIVE WAY AND HAVE EVERYTHING AT THEIR FINGERTIPS THAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY GO TO AN INSPECTION -- INCLUDING THE DIRECTIONS YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO GET THE RUSSIANS THE FACILITY. PART OF ANY NEW SYSTEM OR SYSTEMS WHATEVER PLATFORM YOU USE IS ALWAYS HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE DATA MIGRATION HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH ALL THAT ALL DATA. LICENSING NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE PRIOR HISTORY OF SILLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT THAT WHAT THEY DO. BECAUSE ALL OF THE DATA THAT'S IN THERE WAS CREATED OVER THE LAST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT IS AND IT WASN'T CREATED THE WAY THAT WE WOULD DO A MODERN -- TECHNOLOGY IT'S IT NEEDS TO BE MIGRATED TO A MODERN PLATFORM -- SHE MENTIONED LOTUS NOTES WE ALSO USE EIGHT A BASS AND NATURAL WHICH ARE COMPUTER LANGUAGES NO ONE SPEAKS ANYMORE IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIND STAFF TO WORK ON THESE SYSTEMS. SO WHAT ARE THIS PROPOSAL IS IS TO TAKE THAT DATA THAT'S CURRENTLY THERE. AND MIGRATED TO A MODERN -- ARCHITECTURE. IT IS AHEAD OF WHERE YOU NORMALLY SEE THAT AND IN A PROJECT USUALLY SAY WELL HERE'S WHAT WE WANT TO BUILD A FOUR BY. FOUR LICENSE OR IN A BY LICENSES FOR AND DATA MIGRATION IS A PART OF THAT. BECAUSE WE ARE STILL IN THE PROJECT APPROVAL -- SCALE FOR GOING FOR ONE EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FOR THAT WE KNOW THAT DATA MIGRATION IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT. AND WE KNOW THAT BY PUTTING IT AT THE TAIL END SO TO THE CABOOSE ON ON THE PROJECT. YOU ARE WITHOUT MUCH LONGER BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE WORKING SOFTWARE IN THE HANDS OF THE STAFF WHO NEED IT. BY BRINGING THE DATA MIGRATION FORWARD AND PUTTING IT IN IT IN-A IT'S IT'S A SYSTEM AGNOSTIC WAY IT'S JUST PUTTING IT INTO A MODERN ARCHITECTURE WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND STAFF WHO CAN WORK ON IT. WHATEVER SYSTEM WE BUILD WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT DATA AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN GET A SYSTEM CONFIGURED TO BE ABLE TO DO IT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AN EXTRA THREE YEARS AT THE TAIL AND TO DO THAT. SO THAT'S THE PROPOSAL BEFORE IT OKAY ALL RIGHT COMING FAMILIA. CONCEPTUALLY INTERSTATE AND THE VALUE THAT THIS ACTIVITY WOULD HAVE ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF JUST OPERATING. CURRENT PROGRAM -- PRACTICES JUST SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH A FLAG FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AS WAS MENTIONED THIS ACTIVITIES A PART OF A BROADER BIGGER PICTURE I. T. PROJECT -- SO JUST ENSURING THAT IF THIS B. C. P. R. PROPOSAL GOES FORWARD THAT THE DATA MIGRATION OR THE DATA CLEANUP ACTIVITY IS PULLED FROM THOSE PROJECT PROPOSALS AND COST ESTIMATES -- TO REFLECT THAT THIS IS HAPPENING AND THEN ANOTHER THING THAT WE WOULD FLAG IS GIVEN THAT THE PROPOSAL'S BASED OFF OF ESTIMATED COST -- AND WOULD BE SPENT ACROSS THREE YEARS RATHER THAN PROVIDING THE FULL AMOUNT OF FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE -- TO PROVIDE FIRST YEAR FUNDING AND THEN WHEN COST -- WE GET A BETTER SENSE OF COST. OF ACTUAL COST -- HAVING THE ADMINISTRATION COME BACK AND REQUEST THE REMAINING AMOUNT -- THAT'S NEEDED [inaudible] IT'S DOESN'T REDUCE FRONT OF AN ANSWER -- AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL THEN AS ACTING DIRECTOR LARRY STATED THAT THERE'S AN AGING INFRASTRUCTURE HERE THAT'S GONNA INVENTION WE NEED TO BE UPDATED -- THE PROPOSAL IS IN LINE WITH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES -- PAL PROCESS AND ADDITIONALLY LAST YEAR FINANCE INSTITUTED BUDGET LETTER -- EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE THE REQUIRES THAT ANY PROJECT THE RECIEVES FUNDING -- ANY AYE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT THE RECEIVES FUNDING -- PROVIDE AN ANNUAL -- PLANNING EXPENDITURE REPORT SO WE FEEL THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE -- OVERSIGHT -- TO TO MAINTAIN AND AND AND FOLLOW WHAT THE PROJECT IS DOING SO AGAIN WE ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT THE THE PROPOSAL AS IT IS FOR THE FUNDING OR THREE YEARS. THE QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALRIGHT SO JUST TO CLARIFY SO BASICALLY I MEAN THIS IS A THREE YEAR PROJECT SO IT IS A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME [inaudible] CORRECT. THE THE WAY THAT THE COST ARE LAID OUT IN THE B. C. E. AND THE COST WOULD BE EXPENDED OVER THREE YEARS RIGHT. BOB. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO ACTUALLY DO THE DATA MIGRATION TO GET TE CONTRACT EXACTLY EXACTLY RIGHT SO OKAY SO I I'M JUST SAYING NO SO I MEAN FOR SO LIKE I HEAR YOUR CONCERN ABOUT FIRST OF ALL. VIEWS AS PART OF A LARGER PROJECT WERE SERVED BUDGING FOR THE SEPARATELY AND WE DON'T GET DOUBLE COUNTED RIGHT SO BECAUSE WE'RE PAYING FOR NOW ON ITS OWN IS THAT WE NEED TO AND THEN WE THAT SOMEONE FALLS INTO COSTS AND OTHER THINGS AND THEN THE OTHER PART. THAT IT NEARLY YOU SAID IT'S A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW WE'RE STARTING IT'S A LITTLE BIT AN ESTIMATE WE DON'T KNOW BUT I MEAN IT'S ALSO IT'S NOT AND IT CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS. THAT OR ANYTHING SO IT IS IS A THREE YEAR WE COULD NEXT YEAR EVEN THOUGH WE APPROPRIATED THREE YEARS SAY A HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SPENT SO FAR WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT SO. AND THAT'S ONE ALTERNATIVE AS WELL IF YOU GO FORWARD WITH AS IT'S PROPOSED PROVIDE THE FULL AMOUNT OF FUNDING BASED OFF A% COST ESTIMATE IS JUST ENSURING THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE -- THAT WOULD REQUIRE. THE ADMINISTRATION COMING BACK. OF REFLECTING THOSE ACTUAL COST MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE OBVIOUSLY REPORT NEXT YEAR AS TO WHAT ACTUALLY WAS EXPENDED DAY OUT OF THE THREE YEAR POTTON WHERE YOU ARE WITH THAT SO OKAY. AND I I DO SO BY THE WAY WAS WAS THE WAS THEIR STUFF SENT OVER IN WORD PERFECT. THERE'S SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN BORN NO MORE TALK ABOUT LOTUS AND WORD PERFECT. SORRY I HAD TO THROW THAT IN THERE. AND CITY BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE GOING WORK PERFECT FOR YOU TALKING ABOUT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE YEAH I'D CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT YEAH WE NEEDTO GET THE DATA TOGETHER INTO A FORMAT -- SO IT'S READY FOR MARTIN ARTS ARCHITECTURE AND THAT AND THAT DOING THAT HAD A TIME AS LONG AS IT'S IN A DIME. STRUCTURALLY NEUTRAL MANNER AND YOU GO TO WORK AND I SOON BECAUSE THE APART TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVED OF THE LARGER PROJECTS THAT THEY'VE GIVEN YOU ADVICE ON WHAT. DATABASE OR FORMAT DATABASE THAT THIS TO GO INTO SO IT'S USABLE BY. OKAY EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD SOME OF THE COMMENTS ON AS MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE REDUCING LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACTS AND CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON THE TRACKING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLS EMBOSSED INVOLVING FOSTER USE -- WE HAD THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CONTACTS IN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WHAT WE DO IS WE CONDUCT CASE MANAGEMENT INSPECTIONS OF ANY FACILITY THAT'S BASED ON A LICENSED CAPACITY THAT REPORTS ABOVE AVERAGE. AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS IF THEY ARE THERE PROVIDING ADEQUATE CARE AND SUPERVISION PROVIDED TO DEAL WITH THESE BEHAVIORS AND SAID I'M IN LIEU OF CALLING LAW ENFORCEMENT SO WE'RE ASKING FOR FUNDING. FOUR THREE L. P. A.'S TO YOUR LIMITED TERM BECAUSE WORST WERE HOPING THAT THESE CALLS ARE GOING TO BE -- DECREASING AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE TWO YEARS TO SEE JUST TO FOR THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD. OKAY THANK YOU ALEJO COMMONS FINANCE. QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SOUNDS BUT MAKES LICENSE OKAY LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR CCL RELATED. HUMAN SERVICES TECHNICAL BCP'S CELL YEAH I GUESS WITH A BUNCH MARK. SO I'LL JUST BRIEFLY GO THERE SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BCP'S IN HERE SO THE FIRST ONE IS -- BASED ON ONE CHILD CARE CENTER LICENSING -- A LICENSE INSTEAD OF HAVING THREE SEPARATE APPLICATIONS THAT WOULD INCLUDE -- SERVING INFANT TODDLER AND PRESCHOOL SO THAT WAY THEY CAN MOVE IT'S IT'S MARK STANDARD THEY CAN MOVE CHILDREN IN BETWEEN THOSE DIFFERENT LEVELS MUCH EASIER. SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE SO WE'RE ASKING -- FOR ONE POSITION ONE LPA JUST TO WRITE THE REGULATIONS FOR THE POLICY. A LIMITED TERM POSITION WHICH WE DO A FAIRLY GOOD DESCRIPTION SO YOU CAN KEEP IT REALLY SHORT ON EACH ONE OKAY OKAY THE SECOND. IS THE AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE HOME CARE AIDE REGISTRY WHICH IS LABOR ORGANIZATIONS JUST WORK REQUESTING ME -- THE NAME PHONE NUMBER OF EACH HOME CARE AIDES SO WE JUST ARE ASKING FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR OVERTIME AND NO STAFF AND AND THAT'S RAN A THOUSAND WILL ALSO BE FOR AN I.

SO WE'RE ASKING FOR ONE HEPA TO DEVELOP THE POLICY AND INCREASE AWARENESS -- FOR CHILDREN IN THESE FACILITIES. AND THE LAST ONE IS -- IS ASKING -- FOR POSITIONS FOR CENTRAL APPLICATIONS UNIT WE HAVE -- WE'RE ASKING FOR FUNDING FOR THREE PERMANENT POSITIONS AND FOR LIMITED TERMS -- STAFF SERVICES ANALYST FOR THAT TO CATCH UP WITH THE THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS WE RECEIVE. AND THAT THE LAST PART OF THAT IS THE THIRTEEN COMPLAIN AND INVESTIGATIVE -- L. P. A.'S THAT WE'VE RECEIVED TWO YEAR LIMIT TERM FUNDING FOR THE LAST.

HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES TO TO WORK WITH YOU TRAFFIC YOUTH AND TO REALLY FOCUS ON YOU KNOW EVERY DAY THAT -- THEY'RE NOT BEING TRAFFICKED IS A IS IS GOOD IS FOR THEM TO PROMOTE HEALING AND IT'S A REALLY STRONG KIND OF ENGAGEMENT MODEL THAT REALLY KEY TRIES TO FOR CONTINUE. TO FOCUS ON BEING WHERE THE USE IS CONNECTING WITH THM NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND KEEP BE THERE FOR THEM WHEN THEY NEED NEED THE ASSISTANCE AND SO. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT MODEL -- MINUTES BASED ON THAT KIND OF RELAPSE TO RECOVERY KIND OF MODEL THAT YOU OFTEN SEE IN SUBSTANCE USE THAN OTHERS BUT WE WE ARE KIND OF PUSHING THE ENVELOPE AS A STATE WITH -- WORKING ON WITH THE HARM REDUCTION MODEL -- A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS -- I WOULD SAY THAT -- OUT OF HOME CARE CASELOAD IS DECLINING YOU'RE FORCING MORE MORE PLACEMENTS WITH WITH RELATIVES OFTEN TEENAGERS WITH RELATIVES -- WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO -- GOOD SOLID WORK WITH THE MUROC IN THE CROUP TRIBES TO IMPLEMENT THEIR OWN CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS UP IN THE NORTH STATE -- WE'RE WE HAVE RECENTLY -- CREATED -- RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ACTUALLY WERE SHELL HAS DONE THAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS OUT OF THE OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR OMBUDSMAN -- FOR NEW -- AN UPDATED BILL OF RIGHTS -- AND SO THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS A FEW THAT THE CUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THE THE THE PROGRAM IS STILL FACING IS. LARGE -- CERTAINLY AROUND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE THEY STILL -- THEY SAY THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN FOSTER CARE STILL PERFORM EDUCATIONALLY -- LOWER THAN VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER POPULATION THAT'S MEASURED -- IN IN BY SCHOOLS AND SO WE REACH OUT WE'RE WE'RE REDOUBLING SOME OF OUR EFFORT THIS YEAR TO FOCUS ON ON MEETING THE NEED THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF KIDS IN CARE. CERTAINLY WERE WE NEED TO WORK ON THE CONTINUE TO WORK ON PLACEMENT STABILITY. AND WE ALSO AND ARE FOCUSING SOME SOME IT INTEREST ON WORKING ON SPECIALIZED PERMANENCY SERVICES TO TO MOVE YOUNG PEOPLE -- INTO PERMANENT -- LIFELONG -- CARING RELATIONSHIPS. KIND OF MY QUICK OVERVIEW OF THAT OF THAT AT THIRTY THOUSAND FEET. AND ACTUALLY DO I JUST GO THROUGH THE OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL SO HAPPY TO DO THAT SO THIS IS THE NEXT ITEM IS OUR OUR ANNUAL ITEM -- AROUND OUR PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND AS YOU RECALL FROM LAST YEAR THE THE PLAN WAS -- WAS WAS APPROVED IT LAST SUMMER. THE END OF THE THE THE PERIOD IF FOR EVALUATION IS -- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SUMMER -- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE THE PLAN ITSELF HAS A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED ACTIVITIES -- CONTAINED IN IT WE'RE ABOUT 40% THROUGH OF THE THESE ACTIVITIES IN TEN OR WAY NOW WE'RE ON WE'RE ON TRACK TO TO HIT ALL THE ACTIVITIES. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT WE HAVE. TO NOT ONLY HIT ACTIVITY EFFECT COMPLETELY OUR ACTIVITIES WE ALSO HAVE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE SIGNED ON EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT ITEMS -- SO FAR WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN -- INCREASING FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN CASE PLANNING AND DECISION MAKING AND ON THE STATE WHAT QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM -- MOST RECENTLY. WE HAVE -- WE HAVE HAVE PASSED IF YOU WILL THREE OF IMPROVEMENT TARGETS ONE ON THE NEEDS AND SERVICES OF KIDS AND AND PARENTS. INCLUDING FOSTER PARENTS A RISK AND SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND AND CASE MANAGEMENT AND THEN CASE WORKER VISITS WITH WITH THE CHILD AND SO THESE ARE ALL MEASURES THAT ARE WE GET FROM OUR OUR CASE MANAGEMENT REVIEWS PROCESS. ALL OF THEM -- MARK ARE CONSISTENT WITH -- COUNTIES IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR CORE PRACTICE MODEL AND CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES OF CC ARE THAT WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT LATER -- SO IT SO ONE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE INTEL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY OR SO -- TO TO COMPLETE THOSE ITEMS WE HAVE TILL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THAT TOOK TO FOR THE NEEDLE TO TO TO FOR TO MOVE -- TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF OF OF IMPROVEMENT. AND SO BECAUSE SINCE WE'RE DOING SYSTEM CHANGE A NUMBER OF EVEN THOUGH THE ACTIVITIES MIGHT BE COMPLETELY WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR THE DATA TO CATCH UP WITH THEM SO. TWENTY TWO IN IN -- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WILL KNOW -- WHERE WE ARE JUST AT TO CALL OUT WE THERE IS A EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY AT AT AT STAKE HISTORICALLY -- THROUGH THIS IS OUR THIRD ROUND THROUGH THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF OF PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT PLAN TO GO BACK -- YOU KNOW OVER A DECADE OR SO EACH TIME WE'VE MET AND PREVENT TARGETS AND AVOIDED PENALTIES WE THINK WILL LIKELY BE IN THE SAME SITUATION NOW IT'S STILL. HARD TO TELL EXACTLY BUT THE MOVE TO MOVE THE NEEDLES ARE MOVING IN THE ACTIVITIES ARE OCCURRING. THE NEXT ITEM IS UP BRINGING FAMILIES HOME AND MISS THAT WILL HELP US WITH THAT. THANKS FOR YOUR AGENDA DOES A GOOD JOB OF OF AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE -- FROM THAT SO IT YOU THE AGENDA MENTIONS THAT EVALUATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE -- TAKING ON SO A LITTLE BIT ON THAT IT'S A A PRO BONO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UC AT BERKELEY CAL POLICY LAB AND YOU SEE -- USC'S CHILDREN DATED DETERRENCE AND NETWORK THEY'RE DOING AT A PRETTY REMARKABLE -- AS FAR AS WE KNOW FIRST TIME AT PROJECT AFFAIR LINKING THE DATA WE'RE DOING WITH OUR HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA. IN THE TWELVE COUNTIES AT THIS PROGRAM IS TAKING PLACE AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE A A PRETTY ROBUST -- EVALUATION WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IT EVEN AT EARLY EVALUATION RESULTS QUITE YET WE PROBABLY WON'T HAVE THOSE. UNTIL EARLY TWENTY TWENTY OR SO -- BUT JUST THE ACTUAL FEETOF GETTING THAT DATA ELLINGTON PUT TOGETHER IN ITS OWN RIGHT IS A PRETTY EXCITING -- FEE AND SO WHILE WE DON'T HAVE SORT OF FORMAL EVALUATION RESULTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE HAVE SEEN SOME PRETTY REMARKABLE -- IMPROVEMENTS AND SUCCESS FROM THE PROGRAM SO. AS OF FEBRUARY AT THE PROGRAM HAS SAFELY HOUSE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR FAMILIES WHICH OF THE IN THOSE FAMILIES THAT INCLUDES TWELVE HUNDRED CHILDREN I'M SAYING THAT'S JUST AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO KEEP IN MIND -- AND WITH THAT COUNTIES HAVE REALLY SEEN SIGNIFICANT -- INCREASE IN IT AND THEIR ABILITY TO HOUSE FAMILIES MORE FAMILIES -- ANNUALLY SO LAST FISCAL YEAR -- WE WERE AVERAGING ABOUT SEVENTEEN FAMILIES A MONTH THIS FISCAL YEAR SO FAR -- WERE AVERAGING FORTY EIGHT FAMILIES A MONTH SO YOU CAN SEE THAT AS THE PROGRAM IS HAD SOME TIME TO REALLY GET ITS LEGS IT'S IT'S BEEN REALLY SIGNIFICANT -- SO COUNTIES ARE EXPANDING THEIR FUNDS PRETTY -- FOLEY -- AS OF RIGHT NOW MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY HAVE WAIT LISTS WE HAVE ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES ON WAIT LIST RIGHT NOW FOR THE PROGRAM -- AND HAVE SEEN SOME REALLY EXCITING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND THEIR LOCAL HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM AND THEIR THEIR PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES TO THE POINT WHERE -- SOME OF OUR OUR COUNTIES ACTUALLY PARTNER THE PUBLIC PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES TO GET ADDITIONAL FAMILY UNIFICATION PROGRAM FOR VOUCHER IS FROM HIDE AND MANY OF THEM -- OR SUCCESSFUL SIX OF THE TWELVE COUNTIES GOT ADDITIONAL VOUCHERS FROM HI THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS PARTNERSHIP SO THING A LOT OF SUCCESS WE DON'T HAVE EVALUATION RESULTS YET -- BUT THE PROGRAM IS SET TO SUNSET THIS THE FISCAL YEAR. THE NEXT ITEM IS THE FAMILIES FIRST ACT IN THE QUESTIONS WERE. AROUND -- BASICALLY KIND WHAT IS IT AND WHAT IMPACTS MIGHT THAT MIGHT WE SEE. I THINK. THAT THE THE FEDERALIZED IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED HAS MANY CAUGHT MANY PARTS AND MANY STARTIN START OUR START DATES AND SO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS DISCUSSION I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF AREAS PART. ONE OFTEN SEEN AS THE PREVENTION PART IN PART FOR WHICH IS THE CONGREGATE CARE PIECE I THINK ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS FOR US TO TALK ABOUT. TODAY -- HAPPY TO DO A MORE FULL BRIEF AT SOME OTHER TIME BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT ARE REALLY -- IMPACT US THE MOST AND SO -- THE THE THE THE THE FAMILIES FIRST ACTIVE -- IF FOR THE FIRST TIME KIND OF CRACKS THE DOOR OPEN FOR STATES AND AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO USE FEDERAL FOR E. FUNDING FOR SERVICES HISTORICALLY THE FORTY FUNDING HAS BEEN USED -- FOR KAREN SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION CASE WORK THAT KIND OF THING. THE THE THE FOR THE FIRST -- THE FIRST SECTION THE WITH OFTEN KNOWN AS PART. ONE IS -- AN OPTIONAL AN OPTIONAL -- PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO OPT INTO IT AND IT ALLOWS -- FOR AND IT CAN ONLY BE OPTED INTO ONCE PARK FOR IS IN IN OPERATION SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU DO THAT CONGREGATE CARE PIECE THEN YOU CAN OPT IN TO THE TO THE PREVENTION PIECE. IT ALLOWS FOR SERVICES AND FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO -- WHO ARE SO CALLED CANDIDATES FOR FOSTER CARE SO IN OTHER WORDS IF WITHOUT SOME KIND OF INTERVENTION THEY WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THEIR HOME? ALLOWS SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THEM OR THEIR FAMILIES IN KIND OF THREE THREE AREAS. ONE IS -- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT ONE IS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ONE IS IN HOME PARENTING A SERVICES -- AND AND A AND THE AND THE THE LOS PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT WHICH PROGRAMS YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS CREATED A LIST THAT -- IS MODEST AT PRESENT -- AND POTENTIALLY COULD GROW -- BASED ON BASED ON A MORE EVIDENCE OF THESE ARE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS DECIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT CAN BE USED. IN THESE PARTS FOR THESE PURPOSES -- IT IN IN PART FOR THE AND I'LL COME BACK A LITTLE BIT TO THE IMPACT OF THOSE SEE IF AT THE END. SO IT IN PART FOR THERE'S WITH IT IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH IT'S SIMILAR TO BUT NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE KIND OF THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH C. C. R.. IT IS IT HAS FOUR KIND OF AREAS WHERE THERE'S THE TO THE WAY THINGS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT ONE IS THAT THE THE FEDS. HAVE DESCRIBED THIS QUALIFIED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM SIMILAR TO OUR S. T. R. T. P. HOWEVER THE THE ADMISSION CRITERIA ISN'T IS NARROWER MUCH IT MORE -- MORE -- CLINICAL IT CAN BE AND LESS BEHAVIOR -- LET'S SAY THAN WE HAVE IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR CURRENT LAW. REQUIRES THAT NURSING -- SERVICES BE AVAILABLE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IT DOES SAY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRAM WORSE WERE SEEKING CLARIFICATION TO SEE WHAT THAT IS THAT HOW THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED HERE. THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR STR TEEPEES IS THERE REALLY A SOCIAL MODEL ONE NOT A MEDICAL MODEL -- IT ALSO REQUIRES AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY THAT'S NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE STATE THE COUNTY OR THE PROVIDER TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER THAT YOU WHETHER THE YOUNG PERSON SHOULD BE -- IT MATED TO THAT FACILITY -- THE FEDS CAN WAIVE THAT AND WE BELIEVE WE HAVE OUR PROCESS IT FROM C. C. R. WAS WOULD LIKELY MEET IT'S ME TAKE THEIR THAT THE THE INTEREST OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN IN IN IN THAT. AND IT ALSO REQUIRES -- POSTED DISCHARGE FROM THE FROM THE THE THE THE Q. R. T. P. -- SIX MONTHS OF AFTER CARE SERVICES AND THAT IS A IS IS SOMEWHAT TICKET THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN IN OUR IN OUR S. T. OUR G. P.. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OFTEN THE FOLKS? WHO HAVE HAVE TALK WHO TALK ABOUT -- THE FAMILY'S FIRST ACT THINK ABOUT IT AS AS EIGHT CONTINUE. AN EXTENSION IF YOU WILL. A TRIP FROM OF FOR FROM TO THE WAY FROM A WAIVER SO. IF YOU RECALL WITH NOT THE LAW PASSED THE FEDERAL LAW PASSED AND ARE AND THE FORTY WAIVERS THAT MANY STATES ENJOY INCLUDING OURS. THE SUN SETS AT DURING THAT TIME PERIOD THERE WAS THIS THAT SUGGESTION THAT THE THE THE NEW ACT WOULD ALLOW -- FOR DOES MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WAIVER COUNTIES ARE STATES TO TO BE FUNDED IN THAT SO IN THAT PART. ONE OUR ANALYSIS OF WHAT ARE COUNTIES ARE DOING IS -- IT TERMS OF PREVENTION IN EARLIER THAN TO INTERVENTION ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S ON THE APPROVED LIST AT THE MOMENT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT CENTER MEDICAID EXPANSION STATE MUCH OF WHAT IS -- ALL THE COULD BE FUNDED OUT OF FOR EASY -- FOR IN SUBSTANCE USE AND IN MENTAL HEALTH IS LAW LIKELY COULD BE COVERED UNDER OUR CURRENT MEDICAID CITY. PART ONE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE HAD BE IS INVITING TO TWO K. FOR US AS IT COULD BE FOR OTHER. OTHER JURISDICTIONS I SHOULD MENTION SINCE THE IT'S IT'S OFTEN TALKED ABOUT IN IN SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH WAVE WITH THE WAIVER -- ARE ARE COUNTIES ARE LIKELY TO TO SEE A DECREASE OF FEDERAL FUNDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SOME ODD MILLION DOLLARS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE WAIVER -- BECAUSE OF THAT -- OF DECK THE KICKED THE CASE WHAT KIND OF REVERTING BACK TO PRE TO POST -- TO THE CURRENT CASELOAD VERSES THAT THAT THE CASE LAW THAT WE LOCKED IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND FOR SOME COUNTIES ALMOST A DECADE AGO. SO IF FAMILIES FIRST MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE THE ANSWER TO OUR WAIVER SITUATION AS BUT IT MAY BE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS LIKELY NOT IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] NEXT ITEM. OKAY NEXT ITEM IS ARE YOU WOULD ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES WHEN IT COMES TO COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED -- CHILDREN SO LIKE ANY AND ANY NEW PROGRAM AND I WOULD SAY THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL THAT THE THE THE THE THE LITERATURE IS THE PRACTICES ARE -- AND THE INSIGHTS ARE CONTINUING TO EVOLVE AND IT'S NOT JUST HERE BUT IT ACROSS THE NATION WHAT IS SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE THOUGH OF COURSE IT IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT US TO DO IS. DO LITERATURE REVIEWS TALK TO X. SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS -- WE'VE WE VISITED ALL OF THE THE COUNTIES WHO HAVE OPTED INTO THAT -- INTO THE PROGRAM -- TALK WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING PROVIDED SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LEARNED A LOT FROM THOSE VISITS -- AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE TRAVEL FOR COUNCILS -- SEASICK ACTION TEAM AND THE THE SURVIVOR ADVISORY BOARD THAT'S CONNECTED TO THAT WE WORK WITH THEM WE ACTUALLY DEPARTMENT FUNDS THOSE ACTIVITIES AS WELL -- IT'S AND SO AS A RESULT THE FIRST KIND OF THINGS WE'VE DONE IN ADDITION TO THE THE HARM REDUCTION -- MODEL I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WE OF COURSE CREATED -- AND A NUMBER OF DEMO USE OTHER BE LOCAL COMMUNICATION AND TASK FORCE AND THOSE KINDS OF KIND OF SYSTEM LEVEL THINGS. HAPPENING WHAT WE WHAT WE FOCUSED OUR ENERGY ON MOST RECENTLY THOUGH -- GIVEN THE THE THE THE NEED FOR SERVICE SAYS -- IS -- DEVELOPED A MODEL THAT WE GO THROUGH -- THROUGH QUERYING THE FIELD SO WE DID AN RFI -- IN THAT IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO GET THE BEST THINKING OF FROM THE FIELD ON WHAT. WHAT AND HOW OUGHT WE BEST SERVE -- VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING IN AND SUPPORT THEIR HEALING -- AND THAT THAT ARE IF  WAS IN TRANSIT TRANSLATED INTO AN R. F. P. THAT WE RELEASED IN THE FALL OF LAST YEAR. WE ARE IN THAT THE THAT WE'RE WE'RE IN THAT NOTIFICATION UP SPACE NOW SO -- WE'VE WE WE HAVE OUR INTENT TO NOTIFY THE AND THE CONTRACT WOULD BE THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN -- WE INTEND IT TOMORROW'S THE FINAL DAY FOR LIKE PROTESTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO BARRING ANY PROTESTS WE'D BE ABLE -- TO TO AWARD THAT CONTENT AWARD THAT -- THAT ARE OF P. AND WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE CONTRACT IN PLACE -- IN SUMMER -- IN THIS IS A DEVELOPING AT AT A A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SERVING -- VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING THEY INCLUDES -- DROP IN KINDS OF CENTERS HOME BASED -- CARE THAT'S VERY SUPPORTED -- A RESIDENTIAL COMPONENT -- CONNECTIONS TO A COMMUNITY EXTRA CURRICULAR AND AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. LARGELY WE SEE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE -- AT ALL I A PILOT IN THE BAY AREA COUNTIES -- WITH SOME -- WITH SOME -- EVALUATION ATTACHED WE WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS AND SPREAD TO THE MODEL ELSEWHERE WE DOES IT SEEM TO THAT OTHER THAT IT THAT THAT BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY SMALL POPULATION -- ALTHOUGH OF OF OF FOOD THAT IT MADE SENSE FOR THE STATE TO TAKE ON THIS KIND OF WORK RATHER THAN EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY TRYING -- TO THEY THEY CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO BUT TRYING TO DEVELOP A MODEL SEEM TO BE MORE -- THE KID TO WHAT THE STATE -- THE VALUE TO THE STATE COULD BRING WHILE THE COUNTIES DO THE DAY TO DAY WORK WITH THE WITH VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY -- COMES FROM ILIO. OVERALL FINANCE QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES SIR TARA. QUICK QUESTION I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION WHERE DO WE SEE -- EXPLOITATION ON YOU KNOW FROM THE YOUTH IS THERE CERTAIN AREAS OR CITIES IN THE STATE WHERE. YOU'RE FINDING MORE -- CONCENTRATIONS OF THIS THIS ISSUE HERE. SO THE THE THE CERTAINLY THE BAY AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TYPICALLY ANYWHERE THAT THERE IS -- A INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SOURCING ALSO THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- AT AT AND SO WE'RE YOU WILL LIKELY SEE TRAFFICKING -- IN AREAS OF BIG CITIES AND AREAS THAT ARE KIND OF RESORT ISSUE AND THAT ARE A NY NEAR HIGHWAYS. AND WHERE THEY AT WHERE THERE ARE. CLOSEDINTERSTATE HIGHWAY SO WE'RE SEEING IT FOR SEEING -- OF VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT JUST TO THE OFTEN PEOPLE THINK EXCLUSIVELY OF MAYBE. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND MAY BE -- AND AND MAYBE THE BAY AREA AND THE CLEARLY THERE ARE CONCENTRATIONS THERE BUT WE'RE WE'RE SEEING -- TRAFFICKING VICTIMS IN VIRTUALLY. ALL OF THE ALL OF THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA WE DO HAVE DATA I CAN PROVIDE DON'T HAVE IT WITH ME TODAY THE HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT TO TO STAFF OR TO YOUR STAFF DIRECTLY OUT. WHEN IT WILL GET IT TO YOU THAT? THANK YOU -- STASHED FEW QUESTIONS -- SO FOR FIRST OF ALL -- YOU MENTIONED THAT -- NO THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS THE IS EDUCATIONAL -- PERFORMANCE -- FOR TRUSTEES CHILDREN SYSTEM AND CLEARLY THEY HAVE THEIR FACING A LOT OF CHALLENGES -- AND TING INCLUDING EVEN. THEY'LL BE MOVED AROUND A LOT SO THAT HAVING A WHAT IT WHAT IS YOUR DEPARTMENT DOING LET'S SAY WITH. EDUCATION ARE I GUESS IS REALLY MORE DOWN ON THE GROUND LEVEL LIKE WORKING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS I MEAN WE DO WELL CFF SO RELEASE. THE ORDERS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THERE'S NOT INVESTORS OF COMMITTEE BUT THAT AIM TO IT TO ANYTHING LIKE OKAY YOU IDENTIFIED THIS PROBLEM HERE RIGHT. WHERE SHOULD WE BE COMING TOGETHER TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES -- FOR FOR FOR FOR THESE -- CHILDREN. PROVIDES SHOWN HERE THERE'S A THERE'S A HANDFUL OF OF KIND OF TANGIBLE AND PRACTICAL THINGS I THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT -- IS AND CAN'T DO -- DO -- AND I SHOULD ALSO SAY THAT WE AMONGST MANY -- THE FORMER FOSTER USE THEMSELVES -- EDUCATION THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY OTHERS -- EVEN MONDAY IN THIS BUILDING HAD AN EDUCATION SUMMIT AND THERE'S AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN -- AT IN IN COLLABORATING TO SOLVE THE BIGGER BIG PROBLEMS AND SOME OF THE LITTLE LITTLER PROBLEMS TO TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO WE WE DO SUPPORT EDUCATION -- TASK FORCE -- THAT'S MADE ITS MULTI DISCIPLINARY HAS PEOPLE LIVED EXPERIENCE ETCETERA TO TO TO LOOK AT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PRACTICES WITHIN OUR PORTFOLIO AND SEE HOW WE CAN BETTER. DO THAT -- AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WE ARE EXCHANGING DATA WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT A SCHOOL DISTRICT BY SCHOOL DISTRICT KIND OF BASIS TO SEE HOW. HOW HOW PERFORMANCE IS HAPPENING SOME OF THE THE THINGS THAT I THINK YEAH YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ONE OF THE MANY? OFTEN THE SCHOOL -- POOR SCHOOL PERFORMANCE IS TIED TO INSTABILITY OF PLACEMENT AND SO IF WE CAN -- REDUCE PLACEMENT MOVES WE ALSO REDUCE SCHOOL MOVES. AND SO WE ARE -- WE'RE FOCUSING ON THAT AREA -- MOVE LARGELY BY SUPPORTING CARE GIVERS AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE -- THROUGH THAT THROUGH OUR CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM PROCESS WILL TALK ABOUT MORE IN C. C. R. BUT THROUGH BUT THROUGH A WHOLE BUNCH AND PROVIDING -- FOSTER PARENTS AND RELATIVE CARE GIVERS WHAT THEY NEED TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT COME UP AS A RESULT OF KIDS DEALING WITH COMPLEX TRAUMA SO WE'RE LOOK WORKING ON PLACEMENT STABILITY WE ALSO NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF OF OF WE THERE IS -- PROVISIONS IN LAW THAT ALLOW FOR IT YOU KNOW UNDER REASONABLE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO REMAIN IN THEIR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN OR WITH THE SCHOOL UP WITH THEIR SIBLINGS. AND SO I THINK WE WE ARE COMMITTED IN THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH SOME OF OUR ADVOCATE COLLEAGUES AND AND WITH THE COUNTIES ON MAKING SURE. THAT -- FOSTER PARENTS AND CARE GIVERS ARE ARE AWARE OF THE THAT FUNDING SO THAT THAT MADE REPEAT REDUCE SOME BARRIERS. FOR STABILITY AS WELL. WE ALSO -- PLAN TO YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE ARE WE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB. TWENTY EIGHTY THREE OF THE MOST I SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUNG PEOPLE WE HAVE -- SOLIDIFIED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH -- THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT EDUCATION THEY'VE BEEN DOING LOTS OF WORK WITH US ON CC ARE THE SO CALLED YOU KNOW THE MORE THAT THE THE THE MULTI SYSTEM YOUNG PEOPLE -- BUT WE DO NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THEM AS PART OF THIS GROUP TO TRY. TO TACKLE SOME OF THOSE THINGS IT IS COMPLEX BECAUSE IT MUCH OF IT IS THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL NOT EVEN AT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF AD LEVEL -- MEN SO WE ARE -- YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE CAN DO WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT OTHERS TO WHO ARE GOING TO ADVOCATING WORK LOCALLY BUT THOSE TWO OF THOSE TO HE THINGS I THINK ARE THE MOST TANGIBLE THINGS WE CAN DO AT THE MOMENT. YEAH SO CERTAINLY -- I WOULD APPRECIATE -- UPDATES -- OUR IDEAS ARE COMING OUT THINKING ABOUT THIS PROCESS SO MANY. SEGMENTS SO AT I'M JUST THINKING LIKE ALRIGHT AND ACTUALLY -- BECAUSE I NOT ONLY CHAIR THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR HOUSE I SAID ON EDUCATION I SAW HIM IN SERVICES OKAY. AND NOW IS A LOT OF THE LIKE WE'RE TALKING A FOSTER YOUTH IN THE SERVICE YOU PROVIDE THEM YOU KNOW AND TERMS WHAT'S GOING HOMES THAT YOU IN WHAT YOU CAN DO THERE RELATED SCHOOL DISTRICT I THINK ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICT SPECIAL EDUCATION BY MANY OF THE MAYBE IN SPECIAL. EDUCATION WE GOT MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT SCHOOL ONE THING I WANT TO TRY TO WORK WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS HOW DO WE DRAW DOWN MORE MEDI CAL MONEY. FOR PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES AT THE SCHOOL AND RECOGNIZING THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE FOSTER FAMILY THERE WITH IS YOUR PRIMARY CONNECTOR I MEAN WE ALL GREW UP IN WE HAVE. TEACHERS OR COACHES OR OTHER PEOPLE AT SCHOOL THAT ALSO HELP MENTOR US AND SO FORTH SO THAT RELATIONSHIP IN DISABILITY THAT RELATIONSHIP CAN ALSO BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY USE. AND PARTICULARLY FOSTER YOU SO. THERE'S SOMETHING I HOW THESE THINGS COME TOGETHER AND WE'RE ON OUR OWN SILOS BUT SAYING LIKE OKAY WHAT CAN WE ALL. DO RIGHT SO ARE ARE THE HOLIDAY OUR TO MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH SERVICES AVAILABLE ART EDUCATIONAL SERVES ABLE AND WHERE DOES SUPPORT IN THE COMEDIAN THE HOME WHICH I KNOW IS THAT YOUR MAILING. DEALING WITH AND HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS ALL COME TOGETHER SO -- I REALLY YOU KNOW -- WOULD CREATE -- YOU KNOW YOUR HELP AND YOUR IDEAS I MEAN YOUR YOUR MARKS THIS CELL. AND SAYING LIKE OKAY HOW DO ACROSS THE SILOS AND AND HOW CAN WE HELP HERE TO HELP BRIDGE THE SALAS TO WRITE AND SELL IT AND AND I CONVERSATION. SO OKAY NIGHT PRE SHEET THAT -- ANOTHER QUESTION I HAD -- IN TERMS OF REALLY APPRECIATE THE UPDATE ON BRINGING FAMILIES HOME -- YOU MENTIONED THAT -- WELL TO BE A PEOPLE WEIGHTLESS IT SEEMS LIKE THREE SUCCESSFUL AT SUN SETTING SOON -- WHERE A SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT AND ALSO IT? OUT HOW DO WE MOVE THIS -- IN TERMS OF SCALE IS THIS SOMETHING WE CAN ALSO SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. THAT IT -- MAKING LARGER FOR MORE REALITIES IT ALL OVER THE STATE RIGHT NOW IS ONLY CERTAIN COUNTIES. SO YEAH Và BRIEFLY YEAH THAT WOULD SO IT WAS A COMPETITIVE -- OPERATION RIGHT SO THERE ARE THE TWELVE COUNTIES THAT ARE THEY'RE DOING IT WAS INTENDED TO BE A PILOT AND WE ARE TRYING TO WAIT FOR THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION. TO EARLY INDICATIONS ARE SHOWING THAT IT IS A UNIFYING FAMILIES FASTER THAT SORT OF THING BUT WE'RE DOING THE EVALUATION FOR PURPOSE -- SO I MEAN I THINK WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF TALKING TO COUNTIES RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR THEM AND SORT OF EVEN FOR THAT FOR THE FAMILIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING HOUSE TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S OTHER RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE NEXT ROUND. IF THEY'RE SOME OF THE OTHER STATE FUNDING THAT THEY COULD BE -- CONNECTING THEM TO BUT WERE. OKAY ALL RIGHT WITH WE TEND TO DO A LOT OF PILOTS AROUND HERE AND THEN SOME DAYS AFTER THE PILOTS DONE WE JUST CONTINUE THE PILOT AND LIKE WELL WE SHOULD BE THEIR WORK SO MUCH TAKE IT THE SCALE OR IT DOESN'T WORK. SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT SO I APPRECIATE THAT. OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT TO GET THE VALUATION DATA AND APPRECIATE THE UPDATE ON THE EVALUATION -- BUT I'M ALSO THINKING LIKE OKAY. CELLS THE END DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE VALUE WHICH HAS TO BE COMPLETED BUT IF IT SOUNDS PROMISING WE SHOULD BE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT OKAY. THE THINGS THAT SEEM TO BE WORKING REALLY WELL HOW DO YOU BRING THAT SCALE AND GET MORE PEOPLE AND MORE RESOURCES -- THE I'D START TO MAKE NOTE THAT -- IS YOU MENTION ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE FAMILIES FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT YOU DID MENTION WERE LOSING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING POTENTIALLY - BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LINED UP FOR THE DAY CARE THAT RIGHT OR NOT. YES I I THINK ULTIMATELY SO THE THERE THERE ARE AT ACT ACT -- FEDERAL IS -- ACTIVITIES BY A CALIFORNIA COUNTIES AND OTHERS OTHER STATES TO LOOK AT OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE WAIVER UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION WHAT -- WHAT I WAS DESCRIBING IS THAT -- THERE THAT SAYS COUNTIES ARE AT RISK OF FOR LOSING SOME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE FEDERAL ALLOCATION WILL WILL WILL WILL WILL DROP -- AS A RESULT OF THE THE WAIVER AND THAT KIND OF WHAT I WOULD ARGUE THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE FAMILIES FIRST ACT FOR WHAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE. HAPPEN TO BE DOING -- SO THERE WE WE ARE SO DO WE HAVE A PLAN FOR IF THAT HAPPENS I THE OF REAL CERTAINLY LEASE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE SYSTEM. AS A RESULT OF THAT EVERY. THE READ. ARE WE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT THAT OR DO YOU SIMPLY SAY WHAT WE LOST A FEW HUNDRED MILLION FEDERAL FUNDS ARE WE GONNA TRY HAVE TO MAKE UP SOME ATTITUDE RELY I'M JUST TRYING. TO I I HEARD THE LOSS OF HUNDRED HAVE BEEN HERE PLAN ABOUT OKAY WE'LL LOGIN DO ABOUT IT RIGHT WITHOUT ZERO BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SELL. SPEAKING ABOUT OKAY WHAT WHAT WHAT DO I NEED TO BE PUTTING A MARKER ON JUST JUST RAISED FROM FRANCE I THINK I JUST WANT. TO TRY TO CLARIFY THAT WE'RE TALKING AT THE THE END OF THE TITLE FOR E. WAIVER RIGHT YEAH ENDS I THINK OF CORRECT IT'S COMMITTEE CORRECT OKAY IN IN THE PARTS SEVEN COUNTIES -- COUNTY TO PARTICIPATE IN AND AT THE TIME KNEW THAT IT WAS A WAY FOR OUR THAT IT'S BEEN EXTENDED A FEW TIMES BY THE FENCE SO -- IT'S EIGHT EIGHT I GUESS THE THE THE THE EASIEST WAY TO PUT IT IS THAT COUNTIES HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT THIS. THAT THE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE USE OF THE THAT OF THE TITLE FOR YOU EVER FINDS -- WOULD END AT SOME POINTS FOR THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN THE PLANNING AHEAD TO KIND OF ADDRESS. HOW THEY WOULD -- HOW THAT GAP THAT THEY COULD POTENTIALLY -- END UP -- MISSING OUT ON WOULD WORK BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS. THAT THERE'S ANY SORT OF ADDITIONAL PLAN BEYOND THAT AT THE MOMENT SO I GUESS -- EVEN IF YOU QUOTE NOW AND I APPRECIATE PEOPLE KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN ADVANCE. DID I FORGET THE HELPFUL. THIS WEBSITE WE KNOW IS IF WE'RE GONNA LOSE HUNDRED DALE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HUNDRED MILLION EVER. LIKE AROUND THREE HUNDRED OKAY SO MY GUESS IS THAT LOSS OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION WHAT WE SHOULD DO ABOUT IT NOW WE'LL FIGURE OUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT BUT LOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION IS PROBABLY. SOMETHING THAT IS NOT JUST GONNA HAPPEN AND WITHOUT SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPACT GREAT. YES I WOULD SITES I WOULD I WOULD SAY THIS THAT THE A AS MISTER FREEZE SAID THIS WAS A CHILD WELFARE WAIVER DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. THE THE THE HOPE I THINK FROM THE STATES AND JURISDICTIONS THAT DID THE DEMONSTRATION WAS THEY WOULD DEMONSTRATE ACTIVITIES THAT MADE SENSE AND THOSE WOULD ULTIMATELY MAKE IT INTO WHATEVER THE FINANCE REFORM OR THE FEDERAL LAW CHANGE WOULD BE. WITH THAT DID NOT NECESSARILY HAPPEN FOR US IN IN CALIFORNIA ALL THE COUNTIES PER THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DO YOU HAVE A FACE DOWN PLAN AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THEY'RE OF MECHANISMS IN PLACE -- THE OVER THAT SO IS THERE SO I I IMAGINE THAT I CAN'T READ THE MIND OF THE SAID BY A MANAGER THEY SAID OKAY -- WE GIVE THESE WAIVERS PEOPLE DO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WILL DECIDE WHICH ONES WE THINK WORK BEST WHETHER WE AGREE OR NOT HERE BUT SO WE ASKING PEOPLE THAT THEN TRY TO LINE UP WITH US. SO THAT WE CASE WITH WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CURRENTLY PROPOSING OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T AGREE WITH IN TERMS I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LIKE WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GO AFTER THE WAIVERS -- COUPLE THINGS VOTE WILL LIKELY WILL WILL IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL LAW IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE WAIVER EXPIRES IN IT BEFORE THAT -- CERTAINLY THE THE THE WE CAN WORK WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS TO IMPLEMENT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH. THE THE PREVENTION PIECE IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT THE THEY'RE DOING FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION NOW WOULD BE DIFFERENT AND AS I SAID. BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH OF IT COULD BE MEDI CAL -- REIMBURSABLE THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN REALLY DO YOU AND THEY WON'T THE AND WE HAVE TO DETERMINE THAT MEDI CAL COULDN'T DO SOMETHING BEFORE WE COULD USE THE FORTY CLEARLY. BUT THAT IT WILL BE USING THE NEXT TWO YEARS OUR THAT'S OUR TOP TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN ADDITION TO BE LINING UP WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO IMPLEMENT PART FOR BECAUSE IT'S THE LAW. WE WILL BE WORKING ON A WAYS TO MATT TO TO LOOK AT BOB HOW COLLUDED WITH SOME OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE CANDIDATES AND THEIR FAMILIES GET SERVICES. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN LOBBYING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EXPAND THE LIST -- WE HAVE. MANY MANY STATES HAVE THAT THE THAT WE KNOW THAT THE LIST OF APPROVED PROGRAMS WILL IN FACT GROW THERE ARE SOME VERY SPECIFIC KINDS OF REQUIREMENTS RELATE RELATED TO KIND OF RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN -- PROMISING OUTCOMES AND TO DETERMINE IT TO TO MAKE THAT LESS SO -- WE WILL BE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEGE TO MAXIMIZE WHATEVER WE CAN FROM THE CURRENT THE NEW FEDERAL LAW ALL RIGHT SO -- SINCE WE HAVE THE SELF WHEN THINGS LET'S PUT A MARKER ON THIS THAT DELVE INTO MORE DEEPLY E. IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO YEARS RIGHT HE SAID ROUGHLY CELL BY NEXT YEAR WE DEFINITELY BETTER HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. IF THE SO THE THAT'S OUR OFFICIALLY FOLLOW THIS OKAY. ALL RIGHT NOW THANK YOU AND THAT THEY REALIZE THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH IN THIS FEDERAL CONSTRUCT TO SELL BUT DIED THINK WE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE PLAN IS FROM THE COUNTIES AND WHAT. THE STATE'S GOING TO DO. AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT THE THE SITUATION YES. I JUST WANNA TO AN ADULT SO THAT -- SOME OF THE FUNDING THERE WHERE WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE SO SEATED -- IS PART OF THE THE PROGRAMS OR YOU WENT REALIGNED IN THE TWO THOUSAND OLYMPICS SAFETY REALIGNMENT SO -- THERE ARE THERE ARE FUNDS A COUNTIES TO RECEIVE THROUGH THE LOCAL REALIGNMENT FUNDS AND SO ON SO. I THINK THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS AND AND KIND OF TO GIVE COUNTY NINETEEN THEY'RE AWARE OF ALL THIS -- BUT WE JUST ONE NOTE THAT -- THERE IS CHALLENGES DICTATING WHAT COUNTY STILL ISN'T EVERYTHING FALLS INTO THAT PROPOSITION THEY'RE ALL OF THIS IS I I THINK I THINK IT'S HELPFUL I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING I THINK IT'S HELPFUL JUST KNOWING THAT THIS IS COMING ONLINE TO MAP THIS OUT RIGHT SO WHAT ARE. COUNTIES PLANE TO DO WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS A STATE AND SO FORTH AND AND DELAWARE WHERE THE FED'S RATE AND HOPEFULLY THE LIST IS A LONGER AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT WITH THREE HUNDRED MILLION THAT. COULD DEAL WHETHER IT'S GOING AWAY OR YOU CAN GET A THROUGH ANOTHER MECHANISM OR WHATEVER ELSE WE JUST. I THINK WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. IT WAS GOING -- TO HOW WE'RE GOING. TO HANDLE THIS AND DON'T COUNTIES MAKE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN TO BE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT WE WILL BE MAKING DECISIONS RIGHT NOW THIS IS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CELL. RESIDED I UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE MAP AND IN THE END WE WOULD NEED TO BE SURE THAT NOW THE KIDS ARE TAKING CARE WHICH I KNOW SOMETHING WE ALL SHARE SIDE. AT THAT AT THIS OR FEEL LIKE I SHARED THIS THING AND A NEED TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON RIGHT -- IN THE SITUATION THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD DELVE INTO A LITTLE MORE MAYBE IT FOR HALF THE LA -- CAN HELP OUT TOO OKAY YES. FEATURE RINKER WITH THE DEPARTMENT JUST TO ADD ON YOU KNOW AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM INANCE INDICATED COUNTIES HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT THIS IS IRVING FOR A LONG TIME I I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HEAR FROM US. WE'RE HEAVILY ENGAGED WITH OUR SEVEN WAIVER COUNTIES RIGHT -- IN PLANNING FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY TAKING ACTIONS -- THE WAIVER EXPIRES AT THE SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR -- SO THEY'RE ALREADY MAKING THEIR COUNTY BUDGETS FOR THE NEXT YEAR IN PLANNING AHEAD FOR THAT -- WE HAVE A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NOT JUST FROM WITH IN CALIFORNIA BUT OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL HELPING US. THINK THROUGH PLANNING AN ALTERNATIVE FUND SOURCES -- IN TWO THIRDS OF THAT IMPACT THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT IS JUST IN LA COUNTY ALONE -- THEY'RE THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THEIR REALIGN FUNDING BALANCES AND SO I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE HEAVILY ENGAGED IN OUR PLANNING WITH COUNTIES. AND EVERYBODY HAS A SHARED INTEREST IN PROTECTING THE WELL BEING OF SNOW AND JUST WANTED TO SAY IT FOR THE ROUND I I APPRECIATE IT AND AND SURE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING ON IN IT AND I THINK IN OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE HERE. I AM I JUST FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE I WOULD LIKE TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE I'M SURE PEOPLE ASK ME EVENTUALLY. AND SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AS MUCH TIME RIGHT NOW TO GET INTO THAT AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO PREPARE ALL THAT STUFF THAT I WANTED A MARKER. FOR NEXT YEAR THAT -- WE MAY WANNA SPEND JUST A LITTLE MORE TIME AND GET LOW MORE FORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS ALL MAPS OUTS AND I I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE COUNTIES UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SO IT'S ONE FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT'S OUR OUR MAPS MOVING FORWARD AND WHAT PEOPLE'S AT EXPECTING WHAT PEOPLE PLANNING TO DO SO. FROM THE FROM OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE WHATEVER OKAY NECESSARY. TO KEEP EVERYBODY FULLY INFORMED OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

WHERE AN IMPARTIAL AND INDEPENDENT ENTITY THAT ENSURE FAST YOU HAVE A PLACE TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS AND TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS? WE ALSO ACT AS A SYSTEM ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM BY PROVIDING SO -- RECOMMENDATIONS -- TO SAYS FOR SYSTEM WIDE IMPROVEMENTS THAT BENEFIT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES INVOLVED IN CHILD WELFARE IN FOSTER CARE -- THE APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT SIX MILLION OVER THE TWO YEAR OF LIMITED TERM FUNDS WILL ALLOW OUR OFFICE TO HIRE SIX ADDITIONAL STAFF TO RESPOND TO THE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE THOUSAND CALLS WE RECEIVE EACH YEAR -- IT WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE TIMELY RESPONSES AND INVESTIGATIONS OF ABOUT SIX THOUSAND NEW CASES EACH YEAR IT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED A MONTH -- AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY CASES THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR MORE THAN NINETY DAYS -- WE ALSO PROVIDE ALMOST TO THE APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND VERIFICATION LETTERS TO FORMER FOSSE THAT ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS FINANCIAL AID AND EDUCATION BENEFITS -- AND LESS WE DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ON COST YOU THE RIGHTS TO FOSTER YOUTH CARE GIVERS AND OTHER ADVOCATES. WE'VE OPERATED -- THE OFFICE OF AUSTIN CAMPUS PERSON FOR TWENTY YEARS ON THE SAME -- RESOURCES DESPITE -- NEW DEMANDS AND A IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THESE RESOURCES ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE OFFICE AND TO PERFORM OUR STATUTORY FUNCTIONS -- IF WE DON'T GET THESE RESOURCES I FOR THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BACKLOG OF CASES -- THAT OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND CONCERNS WILL REMAIN UNADDRESSED. IN LEAVING IT CHILDREN IN UNSAFE SITUATIONS ON THE INABILITY TO MEET THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF DISSEMINATING FALSE YOUTH -- ALSO PROVIDE -- IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOUTH ARE ALREADY ON AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS AND WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE THANK YOU -- COMES FROM ILLEGAL FINANCE. REMEMBER QUESTIONS YES CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION -- BUT WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT -- DOING TO ADDRESS THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED COMPLAINTS OF MOTHER SEEMS LIKE A LOT AND FIVE HUNDRED CASES -- AND DO YOU HAVE ANY ANY EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THAT YOU THINK WILL OPEN BIG MITIGATE THE THE COMPLAINTS OVER RECEIVING. I DON'T KNOW THE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS WILL NECESSARILY MITIGATE THE COME THE COMPLAINTS RECEIVE MUCH OF WHAT WE DO IS A LOT OF A CONFLICT MEDIATION WE'RE WORKING TO CONNECT SOCIAL WORKERS AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN ADVOCATES AND ATTORNEYS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES. I'M SO IT'S REALLY QUITE DYNAMIC DEPENDING ON THE TYPES OF COMPLAINTS WE GET WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH LICENSING TO ENSURE THE THAT THERE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS -- THERE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS SO -- I THINK A LOT OF THE WORK IS -- RELATED TO JUST ENSURING THAT FOSS YOU'D HAVE A VOICE THE PEOPLE pRESPONDING TO THEIR CONCERNS AND THAT THEY ARE IN SAFE AND HEALTHY -- HOMES WHICH I DON'T DISAGREE WITH A AND IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT TRENDS OVER THE SAY THE PAST FIVE YEARS WOULD YOU SAY THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS IS -- BIG COMMENSURATE WITH THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT YOU OVERSEE COLLECTIVELY OR WOULD YOU SAY IT'S INCREASING OR DECREASING. I THINK THAT. THAT'S HARD TO TO TOTALLY ANSWER WHAT WE DID DO IS -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE AND IMPLEMENTED A NEW -- TOOK TELEPHONY -- A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS US TO ACTION ACTUALLY COUNT OUR CALLS PRIOR TO THAT IT WAS USING PAPER AND PENS AND CHECKING HOW MANY BOXES -- A DATE OUR STAFF GOT -- AND WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A NEW CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM -- JUST THE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN JULY TO BETTER LOOK AT THE TRENDS AND TO REALLY ASSESS -- EVENING WEAR THESE GAPS ARE AND WHAT WE CAN DO AS A SYSTEM TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND JUST QUICKLY -- WHO WHERE MISS THESE CALLS COMING FROM? OUR TEAM GIVE YOU A DESCRIPTION WHERE THE CALLS ARE COMING FROM. THE OTHER CALLS COME FROM A VARIETY OF PLACES WE GET CALLS FROM PARENTS WE GET CALLS FROM CLASSES WE GET CALLS FROM LAWYERS WE GET CALLS FROM YOUNG PEOPLE -- FOSTER PARENTS SO REALLY IT'S A DIVERSITY OF OF CALLERS AND ARE CALLING OUR OFFICE WITH COMPLAINTS. AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THESE IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IT LOOKS LIKE THE CASELOAD IS FAIRLY CUTS AT LEAST THERE'S NOT DRAMATIC. INCREASE OR DECREASE SO IT BUT YOU DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A RATHER LARGE INCREASE IN NUMBER OF CALLS. IS AT THE DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTED. TO OUR WELL I TELL IT SOUNDED LIKE -- SO THERE'S TWO THINGS I THINK THAT ARE A IN FACT IMPLY ONE IS WE AS RICHELLE MENTION WE WE COUNT BETTER NOW WE HAVE A MECHANISM TO TO REALLY THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING CAL DEBT -- AND I ALSO FEEL LIKE AFTER TWENTY YEARS OR EVEN A TWENTY YEAR CELEBRATION FOLKS ARE MUCH MORE AWARE OF THAT HAVE BECOME. MORE AND MORE AWARE OF THE OFFICE AS A RESOURCE OVER TIME I'M NOT I'M NOT NECESSARY I I'M NOT NECESSARILY SAYING THAT THERE'S A INCREASED NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AS NECESSARILY. A DECREASE IN THE QUALITY OF CARE OR QUALITY QUALITY OF PRACTICE MORE AS FOLKS KNOW THAT IF THERE IS IF THERE'S A DISPUTE OR SOME KIND OF ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED THEY KNOW THERE IS A PLACE TO GO. TO FOR THAT KIND OF HEALTH OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL CERTAINLY GREATER AWARENESS THE THIS IS A GOOD THING SO BY SIDE. THE SHOW WE WERE LOOKING INTO THAT BECAUSE OF CALLS GOING UP IN CASE LOAD STABLE LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE SO IT. WELL THEN THAT MEANS YOU GAINES DOING GOOD JOB GETTING PEOPLE IN THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND PEOPLE FEEL YOU ARE USEFUL. OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ALRIGHT.

WHEN LEVERAGE WITH FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS IT WOULD RESULT IN TWENTY TWO MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS INTO THE INTO THE TRAINING SYSTEM? WHEN THE STATE REALIGNED THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHILD WELFARE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO COUNTIES? THE LEGISLATURE MADE A VERYINTENTIONAL DECISION NOT TO REALIGN TRAINING. I'M NOT FUNDING REMAIN THAT RESPONSIBILITY REMAINS A STATE RESPONSIBILITY. IN PART TO ENSURE STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY AND EXCELLENCE IN TRAINING UNFORTUNATELY THE SYSTEM WAS UNDERFUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT FUNDED SINCE THAT TIME.

S. H. MY ORGANIZATION AND HOUSING CALIFORNIA ADVOCATED FOR THE CREATION F THIS PROGRAM -- AND AT THAT WAS BASED ON NATIONAL DATA REALLY SHOWING A VERY STRONG LINK BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND CHILD WELFARE TO INVOLVEMENT -- AT THAT TIME NATIONAL DATA SHOWED ABOUT A THIRD OF CHILD WELFARE INVOLVES FAMILIES HAD BEEN HOMELESS. EVEN MORE COMMON -- I HAVE THERE IS A STRONG LINK BETWEEN FAMILIES TRYING TO REUNIFY AND THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HOMELESSNESS AT VALLEY EVEN IF A FAMILY HAS DONE EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN DO TO REUNIFY. WITH THEIR CHILDREN -- THEY CANNOT REUNIFY WITH THEIR KIDS IF THEY DON'T HAVE A SAFE AND STABLE HOME. I'M SO THE BRING FAMILY HER FAMILY'S HOME PROGRAM WAS CREATED AS A DEMONSTRATION -- AND IT USES A HOUSING FIRST MODEL AN EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS THAT WE SEEN WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR THIS POPULATION.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MARITZA STUDIO I AM IN ON MINOR DEPENDENT FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY I'M HERE TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN FOUR EIGHT I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW IMPORTANT TO SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF EXTENT FOSTER CARE CAN BE AND HOW HARD IT CAN BE TO ACCESS THEM AFTER A CERTAIN AGE. I WAS RAISED BY MY GRANDPARENTS STARTING WHEN I WAS AN INFANT. MY FATHER IS A SABLE THERE WAS NEVER ABLE TO CARE FOR HIMSELF OR ME. MY MOTHER CARE MY MOTHER COULD NOT CARE FOR ME EITHER BECAUSE SHE STRUGGLES A SERIOUS DRUG ADDICTION. WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN BOTH MY GRANDPARENTS DIED WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF EACH OTHER IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE I HAD NO PLACE TO GO? I STARTED COUCH SURFING AND SICK REACHING OUT FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS I WAS SERIOUSLY DEPRESSED AFTER MY GRANDPARENTS DIED IT WASN'T SURE WHERE TO TURN. BY THE TIME THE CFS SOCIAL WORKER MET WITH ME AND ACTUALLY EXPLAIN FOSTER CARE AND THE SERVICE IS AVAILABLE I WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF. THE SOCIAL WORKER TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE I WAS SO CLOSE TO EIGHTEEN THERE WAS NOTHING ANYTHING CFS COULD DO FOR ME. SHE TOLD ME THAT WOULD. THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THINGS IN COURT IN TIME TO PROVIDE ME WITH ANY LONG TERM HELP AND I DID NOT MAKE SENSE TO ENTER FOSTER CARE FOR JUST A SHORT TIME. WITH WITHOUT OTHER OPTIONS I CAPS COUCHSURFING AND WORKING WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT YOU SELL TO SHELTERS. TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN ONE OF THE SHELTER WORKERS REFERRED ME TO A LAWYER WHO WAS FINALLY ABLE TO ASSIST ME WITH ACCESSING FOSTER CARE SERVICES.

I AM CLOSE TO FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL I HAVE A JOB AND I'M TRYING TO SAVE SOME MONEY I AM WORKING WITH PROVIDERS TO COMPLETE COLLEGE APPLICATIONS AND BELIEVE THAT COLLEGE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY. PERHAPS THE MOST PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT EXTENDED FOSTER CARE FOR ME IS I WAS ABLE TO FIND PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ME AND THIS HAS MADE ME ABLE TO CARE ABOUT MYSELF AGAIN. WITHOUT THE SUPPORT I CURRENTLY HAVE I BELIEVE I WOULD BE LIVING IN A CAR OR WORSE I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE SCHOOL AND I KNOW I WOULD HAVE LOST THE MOTIVATION TO WORK.

HAVE BEEN FROZEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE AND WERE CUT 10% IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WE HAD A SLIGHT INCREASE ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. BUT NOT NEAR ENOUGH TO COVER THE SOCIAL WORK COSTS THE SOCIAL WORKER INCREASE COST OVER YEARS. THE STATE LAW. REQUIRES THAT EXAM PROFESSIONALS WHICH ARE SOCIAL WORKERS MASTERS LEVEL ARE PAID DOUBLE THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND WHILE THE MINIMUM WAGE ACT MANDATES ANNUAL INCREASES THERE'S NO MECHANISM FOR US TO HAVE A RATE INCREASE ON A SOCIAL WORKER. HEY HOW DO WE KEEP UP WITH THE MANDATES WITHOUT AN INCREASE. IN OF DEVELOPED INTO THE BUDGETING SYSTEM. FFA RATES DO NOT CURRENTLY COVER OUR COSTS FOR PAYING FOR SOCIAL WORKERS -- WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE RATIO REQUIREMENTS DICTATED BY OUR REGULATIONS -- SO THERE'S REALLY NO FLEXIBILITY AND FIND THE MONEY ELSEWHERE -- FFA SOCIAL WORKERS ARE CONSIDERED PROFESSIONALS ARE ON CALL 247-2 SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. AND OUR FAMILIES PRIMARY COMPLAINT IS SOCIAL WORKER TURNOVER. IT DISRUPTS OF PERMANENCY IT DISRUPTS -- PLACEMENTS AND IT IMPACTS THE USE THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO RE ATTACH WE CAN ACT WITH THE NEW SOCIAL WORKER. AT THE PHASER REALLY CAUGHT IN A BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE WE WANT TO PAY OUR SOCIAL WORKERS. AND YET WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO SO. AT A PHASE ARE ALSO -- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN THE WORK -- OF CCIR WE SURVIVE -- THIRTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN IN IN THE STATE AND 25% OF ALL THE FOSTER CARE CHILDREN. USUALLY THE CHILDREN THAT ABOUNDS HOME FROM HOME TO HOME LIVED IN HUNGER CARE. AND WHEN THEY LANGUISHING CONGER CARRIED ACTUALLY COSTS A LOT MORE FOR THEM. WHEN WE WORK ON PERMANENCY WERE ACTUALLY SUPPORTING -- A REDUCTION IN COSTS OVERALL FOR THE COST OF CARE OF A CHILD. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- OUR REQUESTS TO SPECIFICALLY IS TWENTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS. FOR TWO NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN AN ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE CPI -- THEREAFTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FORMS SOCIAL SERVICE ANY COMMENT. BUT I WE AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAID FACTUALLY IS THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR CARE FOR USE -- AS YOU'VE HEARD US SAY ON MULTIPLE PROGRAMS -- THE ABILITY TO SERVE PEOPLE WELL DEPENDS ON A STABLE COMPETENT WORKFORCE AS WELL AND PARTICULARLY WHEN DEALING WITH YOUTH AND THE THE BENEFITS OF OF STAYING CONNECTED WITH SERVICES AND MAINTAINING RELATIONSHIPS IS IMPORTANT. AND APPRECIATED ALEJO FINANCE. CAN EVEN NOW SO YEAH I AND THEY DID IT AND JUST. TO GET TO THE POINT THAT PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT. YOU KNOW WE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR LIFE GOOD REASONS. AND THERE'S ALSO A MINIMUM WAGE FOR PROFESSIONAL THAT'S BASED ON TWICE SO. BASICALLY IT IS THE STATE POLICY THAT'S DRIVING UP AND UP SO SIDE FROM RECRUITMENT RETAIN AND ALL THOSE ISSUES I MEAN -- AND WE AND AND THE NEED OF THAT LEVEL WHETHER EVEN THE PAYS ENOUGH FOR THAT. BUT THE D. VIOLATION THE LAW IF YOU DID ACTUALLY INCREASE THE SOCIAL WORKER PAY IN ADDITION OKAY. SO I MEAN THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WE SHOULD. TRY TO BE SURE WE ADDRESS IT'S OUR OWN POLICIES THAT ARE ALSO DRIVING THAT UP OKAY. RIGHT THANK YOU THESE RICH OKAY ITEM NUMBER SIX CHILD WILL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING EARLY INTERVENTION PILOT PROGRAM. IN THIS AND YOU [inaudible] HEY WELCOME. TO BOTH THREE MINUTES OF YOUR BUT DOING THE THREE DIVIDE UP TIME OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LIBBY SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF US YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA I'M GONNA TO FOR MY TIME TO OUR WITNESS DIAPERS DIAPER STEWART A PH AN FROM LA COUNTY I DID WANT TO JUST POINT OUT IN RESPONSE TO A POINT YOU MADE PREVIOUSLY REGARDING PILOT PROJECTS AND NEEDING. TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE MARK COME MARKER OUTCOMES INCLUDED INTO ANY PILOT WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT IDEAS INCORPORATED INTO THIS. ONE A GOOD MORNING DOCTOR PAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEBORAH STUART AND I AM A MEMBER OF SEIU LOCAL. SEVEN TWO ONE I'VE BEEN A CHAO WILL FOR SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW. AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES PERFORM A WIDE ARRAY OF FUNCTIONS BUT THOSE LIKE ME WORKING IN WHAT WE CALL CHAO WILL FOR SERVICES. THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ACCOMPANIED SOCIAL WORKERS ON HOME VISITS WHERE CHILDREN ARE NOT. YET. AT IN FOSTER CARE BUT AT RISK FOR BEING PLACED IN FOSTER CARE. SO THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN THOUSAND CALLS THAT COME IN LA COUNTY REPORTING THE SUSPECTED CASES OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT EVERY MONTH. SO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES DON'T GO ON EVERY CALL THE RATHER THE CALLS WITH THE CHILD WHEN A CALL COMES THROUGH FROM A HOSPITAL OR DOCTOR CLINIC. A SOCIAL WORKER NGUYEN HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT A SUPPLEMENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION ASSESSMENT HAS TO BE MADE BY PUBLIC HEALTH KNOWS AND IS VERY NECESSARY WHILE WE DON'T GO ON EVERY CALL WE DO MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE. IN THE CASES WE ARE CALLED OUT ONE WE ASSESS EVERY TALENT THE HOME. NOT ONLY THE ONE THAT THE CALL IS MADE FOR THAT IS THE FOCUS TH&lt;c.cyan&gt; BUT FOR EVERY CHILD THAT&lt;/c&gt; IS ATTACHED TO THAT FAMILY. AND BECAUSE OF OUR MEDICAL TRAINING WE ARE ABLE TO OFTEN NOTICE HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR INDICATORS EVEN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT. MIGHT OTHERWISE GO UNNOTICED UNFORTUNATELY ON MANAGED HEALTH CONDITIONS OFTEN RESULT IN CHILDREN HAVE A TO BE REMOVED. FROM THEIR HOMES IN PLACE INTO THE CHAO WILL FOR SYSTEM FORTUNATELY IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE MORE HME IS A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE MAKE AN ARE ABLE TO GO ON I WE ARE BETTER ABLE TO SERVE. AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE KIDS HEALTH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH THEIR BEHAVIOR NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE BEING MET AND CONNECT THESE KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH THE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THEY NEED. AND KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER I'M HERE TO ASK YOU FOR FUNDING IN FUND DOLLARS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE MATCHED BY FEDERAL TITLE NINETEEN DOLLARS SO THAT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES. ARE ABLE TO GO OUT ON ME ANYMORE HOME VISITS AND THEN WE ARE CURRENTLY ABLE TO DO. DO REAL CAPPED -- STAFFING IN CASELOAD ISSUES I'D LIKE TO ALSO SHARE A STORY WITH YOU. I RECENTLY WAS INVOLVED WITH THE FAMILY THAT CAME IN ON A REFERRAL WHERE THE CHILD WAS NOT BEING SEEN. WHEN I WENT T THE HOME THERE WAS A FATHER WHO HAD RECENTLY? COME OUT OF THE PRISON SYSTEM HE HAD BEEN A HOUSE IN THE SYSTEM FOR OVER. SIXTEEN YEARS IN AND OUT AND THE LAST STAND WAS. LIKE SEVEN EIGHT YEARS HE HAD NOT REALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE CHILDREN'S LIVES ALL HOWEVER THE MOTHER WAS FACING MULTIPLE DRUG ISSUES AND AT THAT TIME. SHE WAS INCARCERATED AND HEAR THIS FATHER WAS LEFT WITH FIVE BOYS ADHD N. FOR HEMOPHILIACS. THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER FATHER THERE WHO DIDN'T HAVE DIDN'T HAVE TO GET INVOLVED BUT WAS THERE AND I WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS FAMILY GET THEM THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEEDED. AND JUST LINK THEM TO WHAT IS DEFINITELY -- REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES IN AND I'D LIKE TO JUST REQUEST THAT -- A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS ROLE FOR MORE CHILDREN IN A COMMUNITY CENTER AND COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THREE MUCH ANY COMMENTS FROM DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES -- AGAIN YOU YOU'VE HEARD OR DESCRIBE THE VALUE.

THE PILOT IS FOR LA COUNTY HOWEVER WE'RE HOPE WE ARE REALLY KNOWING THAT THIS WILL EXPAND TO THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE PERHAPS WE CAN MAKE THE PILE OF A LARGER RIVERSIDE NOT TOO FAR AWAY. I SEE SACRAMENTO'S ON THE FOUR WAY THERE ISN'T. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION CERTAINLY IS A PHYSICIAN I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY GO WITH PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES OUT INTO THE FIELD AND AND THAT ACTUALLY MADE IT OFF BUT PUBLIC OTHERS ABLE ACCOMPLISH AND IS THIS ABOUT PREVENTION. AS WELL SO THANK YOU THANKS FOR MATCH. YOU. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN FOSTERING SUCCESS SUPPORTING VULNERABLE FOSTER AND CROSSOVER USE NATIONAL CENTER OF FEW FLAW WELCOME. OKAY THANK YOU. MINUTES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS FRANK IT WAS MINE I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW ON OAKLAND. AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK -- IN SUPPORT O A ONE TIME BUDGET ALLOCATION OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO AUGMENT THE FOSTERING SUCCESS FUND -- I'D LIKE TO JUST ARE A BLESSING OF THE THE THIS FUND WOULD. OF FURTHER SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY BASED INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD -- HELP COORDINATE SERVICES -- AND AN AGENCY PROGRAMS TO DIVERT YOUTH AWAY FROM INCARCERATION FOSTER YOUTH AWAY FROM INCARCERATION AND SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT. PROVIDE TRAINING TO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AS WELL AS A GROUP HOME AND SHELTER STAFF WORKING WITH FOSTER YOUTH. AND DELIVER TRAUMA INFORMED A DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE RESIDING IN GROUP CARE. AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO MAKE A MOVE TOWARDS A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH OF DEALING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IN NEED -- AS AS NOTED LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA DID MAKE A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR THIS THIS PROGRAM AND THIS -- PROGRAM IS WELL UNDER WAY WITH CDC. CALIFORNIA APARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES RELATING THE RFP RECENTLY AND HAD A WEAPON ARE FOR INTERESTED PARTIES WHICH YIELDED. FOUR HUNDRED FORTY PARTICIPANTS AND SO THE DEBT WE KNOW THAT THE DEMAND IS IS IS PRETTY GREAT AND UNFORTUNATELY. THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS BUDGET LAST YEAR IS IS A IS VERY HELPFUL BUT WOULD ONLY COVER ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF THE TOTAL NEED STATEWIDE. THE COUNTIES REPRESENT ON THIS COMMITTEE ALONE WOULD CONSUME ALL OF THIS MONEY -- AND AS A NOTED EARLIER AND AND OTHER -- CONVERSATION AT THE TABLE WE ARE EXPERIENCING RECORD HIGH CALLS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND CHILDREN FALL IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM YOU KNOW HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF OF OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT IN TRAUMA. AND YOU KNOW THE VIEW IT PARTICULAR THOUGH THE GROUP CARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO TO BEING PUT INTO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE BELIEVE THAT RELYING ON LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DEAL WITH THESE. ADOLESCENT BEHAVIORS ARE ARE NOT ONLY A WASTE OF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES BUT ALSO PUSH SYSTEM A KIDS INTO THE SYSTEM AT A TIME WHEN THEY REALLY NEED. OUR HELP AND SUPPORT AND TO BE SURE ENOUGH FOSTER YOUTH IN THE STATE'S CARE SHOULD RECEIVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE AND SUPERVISION UNTIL THE RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHICH WE BELIEVE THIS FUND WILL SUPPORT. AND SO YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BUDGET IS BOTH SOCIALLY AND FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BY REDUCING OUR OVER RELIANCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PRIORITIZING COMMUNITY BASED. TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND SERVICES FOR YOU VULNERABLE YOUTH -- WILL ALSO BETTER UTILIZING SCARCE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND I'M ENTIRE DRIVE ALL -- DEALER TO THIRTY SECONDS.

I SPENT TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON DUE TO MY TRAUMA MY I'LL CRY FOR HELP. BEING CRIMINALIZE SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN WE INTRODUCE FOSS SO YOU SEE ANY KIND OF CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE THE NUMBERS TO RECOGNIZE THAT INCREASES THEIR CHANCES. NOT FROM WRAPAROUND SERVERS ARE CASE MANAGEMENT BUT FOR BEING INTRODUCED TO DISCO TO PRISON PIPELINE SOUL.

AND JUST TERE THERE WAS A THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN THAT THAT RECENTLY -- ACHIEVED -- A FOSTER CARE STATUS THAT WITH THAT MANY FOR THAT WITH WITH THINGS STACKED AGAINST HIM THERE'S A YOUNG MAN OF PROBATION -- FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHO WAS PLACED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMPLETED HIS SEX OFFENDER PROGRAM -- WHO HAD HAD HAD? WASN'T ABLE TO GO HOME BECAUSE OF HIS -- BECAUSE HIS VICTIM WAS STILL IN THE HOME OUR WORK WITH -- WITH THE COUNTY OUR CONSULTANTS WORKED ANNE'S GOODMAN'S WITH THE COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS REALLY IF HELP THIS YOUNG MAN IDENTIFY -- ACTUALLY WAS A SCHOOL TEACHER IN HIS IN HIS PUBLIC SCHOOL IN IN IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY. THAT ULTIMATELY BECAME HIS FOSTER PARENTS OF THIS THIS YOUNG MAN IS A ISREPRESENTATIVE OF THE A NUMBER OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WE OFTEN SEE SPEND THEIR ENTIRE -- TEENAGE YEARS IN GROUP HOMES AND AND WITH KIND OF OUR WITH THE DOG HAD TO KIND OF REACH. BEING RE LET MISS AT RELENTLESS AND WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY I BELIEVE THAT THAT THIS KIND OF SICK CHILD SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. HAD A CAN MAKE IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND SO I WANT US TO KIND OF REMEMBER THIS YOUNG MAN AS WE AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND THE CHALLENGES I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO ALSO TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES LET ME JUST TELL YOU I THINK WHERE WE THINK. WE NEED TO SUPPLY FOCUS OUR EFFORTS FOR THE NEXT -- THE NEXT YEAR SO. AS WE HEARD IN PUBLIC COMMENT THERE ARE EIGHT HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE IN LOWER LEVEL GROUP HOMES THAT -- THAT -- 72% OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY COUNTIES AS NOT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS -- FOR S. T. R. T. P. LEVEL OF CARE IT'S THOSE IT'S THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW -- AND AND FIND FAMILIES FOR THEM -- I THINK WHAT THINK WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK OUT WITH OUR HIGH FIDELITY CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS. AND AND AND AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE VOICE AND CHOICE AND IN THEIR PROCESS WE DID WORK BETTER. BETTER AT LOOK AT THE STATE LEVEL AND LOCALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE CANS ASSESSMENT INFORMATION IS SHARED SO THAT COULD BE USED BY BOTH SYSTEMS AND ONE ASSESSMENT FOR ONE KID. I THINK THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO REALLY FOCUS ON ON IN TRAUMA AND HEALING INFORM SYSTEMS OF BOTH AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL AND IN OUR COUNTY WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES. AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT A A SYSTEM OF CARE DEBTS BAIT THAT THAT THAT SUPPORTS FAMILIES AND AND FOSTER CHILDREN INCLUDING THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE. INTENSIVE TREATMENT FOSTER CARE OR INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE WRAPAROUND AND OTHER HIGHLY COORDINATED WAYS TO TO MATH TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS GET SERVICES WHERE THEY ARE. AND NOT HAVE TO BE MOVED TO WHERE THE SERVICES ARE THAT'S MY QUICK IS FAST AS I COULD GO OVER YOU. THANK YOU AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE THE PROPER HEALTHCARE SERVICES YOU'RE TOO RIGHT. AT THE AREA OKAY. SO ALL RIGHT AND OKAY AND IN TERMS OF THE REMAINING QUESTIONS. SOCCER SERVICES WAS GONNA HANDLE THE THE NEXT COUPLE QUESTIONS AND I'LL BE BACK TO ME OKAY SO YEAH SO IT'S A PART OF SERVICE. THANK YOU BRENDA GRANT WISH ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR EFFORTS -- WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SAW SOCIAL SERVICES IN OUR COUNTY PARTNERS -- SO WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TO TO TRACK WHETHER OR NOT CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE GETTING SERVICES -- WE DO HAVE A DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS ARE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WE'VE HAD IN PLACE FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS NOW AND UNDER THAT DATA SHARING AGREEMENT WERE ABLE TO TRACK SCREENING AND REFERRAL SO WHEN CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE GETTING SCREENED -- FOR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND THE REFER TO THEN WERE ABLE TO TAKE THAT DATA MATCHING OVER INTO OUR DATA SYSTEM TO SEE WHICH CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE GETTING REFERRALS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WE REPORT OUT AT THE CCAR'S SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE MEETINGS -- TO TO BE ABLE TO TO DISCUSS THAT MONITOR THAT WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S ONE OF OUR BIG EFFORTS AND SO I WITHOUT IT'S TWO PIECES WERE WORKING ON IMPROVING DATA QUALITY AND ALSO THE ACTUAL. SERVICE DELIVERY AND PROCESS ITSELF SO -- AND THEN -- AS FAR AS THE THE APPROACH IS THAT WE HAVE TO HELP SUPPORT -- CCR AND MAKING SURE THE KIDS ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND YES YOU'RE TWO PEAS -- WE HAVE QUITE A FEW EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDER WAY -- WE HAVE BEEN DOING SOME REGIONAL COUNTY AND PROVIDER CONVENIENCE -- WITH OUR CONTRACTED PROVIDER THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS AND ALSO BEEN REALLY -- POPULAR AND WELL ATTENDED -- CONVENING -- TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT -- AS HERE TO FUSE THEIR PEAK FOSTER CARE -- JUST ANYTHING RELATED TO SEE SEE ARE THAT -- AND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING CONTINUING OUR WORK ON THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE IMPLEMENTATION -- TRACKING THE DATA -- WE HAVE MONITORING COMPLIANCE WE DO TRY ANNUAL REVIEWS AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO TRACK -- ACCESS THROUGH OUR TRAINING REVIEW NEWS -- AND THEN JUST IN GENERAL -- YOU KNOW IT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING OR ARRANGING FOR THE PROVISION OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO MEET -- SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA SO -- YOU KNOW AS PART OF THOSE EFFORTS ON ALL COUNTY PARTNERS HAVE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER -- YOU KNOW WITH REGARD TO S. T. R. T. P. USING OTHER BEEN ISSUES WITH -- KIND OF SOME COORDINATION SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WE DO DEPARTMENTS -- CDSS STATIONS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY ASSOCIATION CWD ACV HDA -- I HAVE TO DEVELOP KIND OF A STEP BY STEP PROCESS TO REALLY HELP KIND OF DEVELOP COME A RECIPE OR LA AND LAYING OUT EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE -- TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS RECEIVE THE SERVICES MADE THEY NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER -- SO OTHERS THAT WORK AND THEN -- JUST IN GENERAL -- FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- IN A TRANSITION PLANNING MAKING SURE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A SERVICES BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THEIR PLACEMENT BUT ALSO TRANSITION PLANNING AS WELL. I HAVE A WOULD END UP BEING REDUNDANT AND I NOTICE TO YOUR IT'S TIME SENSITIVE. OKAY WELL I JUST WANNA BE SENSITIVE TO EVERYONE TO YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS ON OUR AGENDA BUT ALSO BE SURE WE COVERED THIS -- AND EACH ITEM -- EARLY ENOUGH SO. OKAY -- ANY COMMENTS FROM A ALEJO. AND SEE CENTER IN PLANTATION. NOT ON THE PARTICULAR MODEL SERVICES ASPECT OF IT OF THE OKAY BUT WHAT ABOUT SEIZE YOUR INFLATION OVERALL. THE OVERALL SIR -- JUST LIKE THREE EIGHT ARE -- COMMENTS THAT WE MADE IN OUR HUMAN SERVICES PUBLICATION THAT WE DON'T TAKE AN OVERALL ISSUE WITH ESTIMATES. FOR THE BUDGET -- GIVEN THAT IT IT DOES WE DO KNOW THAT IT TAKES IN AND CUT INTO ACCOUNT THE MORE RECENT TRENDS IN THE ACTUAL CASELOAD MOVEMENT -- THAT SAID THERE ARE. SOME ISSUES THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION -- ONE BEING THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES OR QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE LOC OR LEVEL OF CARE RATE STRUCTURE -- PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF THE THE CHECK THE RECENT CHANGES AT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE TO THE LC TOOL -- IN CONSULTATION WITH -- STAKEHOLDERS -- AND ANY KINDS OF OUTSTANDING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MIGHT STILL BE -- ASSOCIATED WITH THAT -- AS WELL AS IN PARTICULAR THE TIMELINE FOR THE ROCK TO THE REMAINING A POPULATION OF FOSTER YOUTH FOR ME WOULD BE APPLIED -- TO AND THE DETAILS ON THE VALIDITY TESTS THAT WOULD BE APPLIED -- AFTERWARD -- TO FOR THEIR VERIFIED THAT VALIDITY -- AND FINALLY -- THE THERE'S STILL A QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE NET IMPACT OF IMPLEMENTATION -- OF THE LOC RATE STRUCTURE WILL HAVE IN CONJUNCTION WITH PLANS -- FOR CHANGES TO S. CI OR SUPPLEMENTAL -- CHARACTER INCREMENTS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL ON WHAT TOTAL -- RATE FAMILIES WILL RECEIVE -- ARE TAKEN CARE FOSTER CHILDREN -- THE OTHER -- ISSUE THAT WE LIKE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IT ARE -- GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR FAITH IMPLEMENTATION TO THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF THE CCIR -- WE WE DO NOTE THAT THERE ARE STILL ISSUES WITH -- DELAYS IN TERMS OF THE PROCESSING OF OUR FAILED LOCATIONS BUT COUNTIES ARE -- EXPERIENCING AND GIVEN THAT -- WHAT'S THIS YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THAT IS -- MERITED -- INCLUDING A SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES WITH THE PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL WHO ARE STILL EXPERIENCING -- ARE FAY PROCESSING TIMES AT OUR EXCEED THE OF THE NINETY DAYS THAT AS AMENDED BY LAW FINANCE [inaudible] COMMENTS OKAY. THE ARTIST THEIR FAQ AS. I MISS READ YOUR OKAY AND I AM WHAT I AM TO ACTUALLY I LIKE ALL THE QUESTIONS AS I GO YOU LEFT THESE OKAY CAN'T SPEAK TO THE THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT WORKS -- TO THAT THAT MR MILLER JUST BROKE AND DOES SPEAK TO IF YOU'D LIKE AND OKAY PLEASE DO YEAH THANK YOU YEAH I IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS GO THROUGH ALL THE QUESTIONS AND AND YEAH AND AND APOLOGIES FOR MISTER MISREADING YEAR. YEAH -- YOUR THAT LIKE I DO SAID LET'S GO THROUGH ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT IT'S AYE AYES ELEMENTS SO THAT OTHER GUY Là PUZZLE THAT. ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW ANSWER THOSE OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO RIGHT SO ON THAT THERE IS THE THE QUESTION ON REGARDING THE THE NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT ON OUR IF A AND AND ITS BACKLOG WELL WE CAN'T DETERMINE SPECIFICALLY. HOW MANY HOW HOW MUCH THE BACKLOG WAS DECREASED BY THOSE DOLLARS WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT -- THAT THE THE ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE THAT THE CASE THE CASES WHERE IT'S THE PLACEMENTS PRIOR TO APPROVAL. THOSE -- THOSE HAVE DECREASED -- MONTHS -- THE THE TOTAL THE OF THE I'M SORRY THE GRAPH MISSING CAP REMINISCENT THE TOTAL OF THE OF THE ONES THAT ARE OVER. NINETY BUT IN BETWEEN IT BUT LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HAVE DECREASED BY 31%. AND THE THE ONES THAT ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS HAVE HAVE DECREASED BY 16% WE'VE SEEN. A TOTAL OF A OF 600-670-00600 AND SIXTY SEVEN ACT APPLICATIONS -- THE DEAD ARE THAT BACKLIT DECLINED BY SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN APPLICATIONS THIS IS JUST OF THAT THE PLACEMENTS PRIOR TO APPROVAL THE OVERALL -- AND WHAT WE'VE NOTICED ON THAT THE TREND OF ALL OF THE THAT THE RFA PROCESS IS THAT. THE THE THE TIME TO APPROVAL WHILE NOT AT NINETY DAYS IS IS COMING DOWN AND AT THE SAME TIME TO PROVE THOSE ARE GOING MORE IT MORE MORE APPLICATIONS ARE COMING THROUGH THE DOOR. CLEARLY THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE THERE AND AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED. OR HOW WHAT WAS WHAT HOW IS THE MONEY USE AND WE'VE SEEN IT BEING USED IN OVERTIME. SOME SOFTWARE PACKAGES WE'VE SEEN IT BEING USED -- TO BOX PROVIDE AND BY MOBILE I'VE SCANNED MACHINE SO THAT THINGS COULD BE DONE OUT IN THE FIELD AND SO WE'VE SEEN OF THOSE AT THOSE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS SOME JUST SOME SOME CHANGES WITHIN IN SOME DEPARTMENTS ABOUT. HALF ALL HANDS ON DECK TO CLEAR THE BACKLOG -- AS A AS A RESULT AT RESULTING IN THE THE CHANGES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE THE LEVEL OF CARE -- PROTOCOL BUT I'D SAY IT WHEN I WHEN I WHEN I THE THERE IS THE QUESTION IS A KIND WHEN WILL BE BE DONE I THINK IS HOW I READ IT RIGHT. AND SO THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS I'D SAY WE DID DO EVER RECOVER RELIABILITY STUDY OF OF OF WHILE BACK IN IT DETERMINED THAT THE THE THE TOOL WAS WAS WAS ROBBERY WAS REASONABLY RELIABLE. AND THE NEXT STEP WAS TO THEN ADD. TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW -- AT SOME ADDITIONAL -- KIDS INTO THE INTO THE USE THE PROTOCOL AND DIFFERENT CHILDREN ON ADDITIONAL CHILDREN I'M SORRY. AND THE WE ARE DOING THAT NOW AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE DEVELOPED THE VALIDITY STUDY AND WE WENT WITH ATTHE CONCLUSION OF THE VALIDITY STUDIES WILL BE ABLE TO GO -- MAKE WHATEVER FINAL TWO WEEKS WE NEED AND THEN GO GO LIVE FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION. AS MR MELINDA'S MENTIONED IN THE MEAN IN THE INTERIM WE ARE IN FACT DOING UPDATING THE MANUALS WE ARE UPDATING SOME OF THE PLACEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE KEY. AND SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES ON THAT AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND HAVING A FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE THE THE THE SCIENCE BEHIND -- PROTOCOL WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE A DIFFERENT A PRIVATE DISCUSSION WITH YOU ON THAT OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AND THEN FIND HE ATE ISSUE NUMBER. SIX NUMBER SIX IS IS THE IS THE THE SO CALLED PAPERS FUNDING TO FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND SUPPORT FINING. SO I WOULD SAY IT AS AS YOU AS YOU MAY RECALL THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDED FLIPPERS AND SOME ARE OF A FINDING AS EVER ADDITIONALLY AS AN UP FRONT INVESTMENT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME WHICH NOW IS SUNSET IN THE PURPOSE OF THAT WAS. TO TO JUMP START AND IDENTIFY SOME ACTIVITIES THAT WERE REALLY KEY -- TO TO RECRUITING EVERY TEN AND RETAINING -- FOSTER FAMILIES -- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT US TO TO TO TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. THE WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN -- THE THE FINDING THE USED FOR AND AT A IS ACTUALLY ON PAGE TWENTY EIGHT OF OF YOUR AGENDA THERE'S A PIE CHART. BUT LARGELY IT'S IT'S BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF IT HAS BEEN USED TO SUPPORT EXISTING FOSTER PARENTS -- AS THERE OFTEN -- WORD OF MOUTH IS A IS A GOOD ARE -- RECRUITMENT STRATEGY AND AND AND A NUMBER OF CONCRETE SERVICES SO THAT THAT FAMILIES COULD ACTUALLY. TAKE IN YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN -- WHEN THEY NEED -- TO THE THE THE REMAINING PART OF THE QUESTION HIS WORLD WHAT AT WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING TO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF WORK AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S A THERE'S A HANDFUL OF THINGS THAT WE'RE THAT OUR ON GOING AGAIN. WE HAVE WE HAVE SUPPORTED -- THROUGH CONTRACT ANNE'S GOODMAN'S WORK ON CHILD SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT SHE'S WORKING A NUMBER OF COUNTIES WE WE HAVE. WE HAVE WORKED HAVE SUPPORTED ALONG WITH CW DA THE QUALITY PARENTING INITIATIVE THAT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON CHANGING THE BUSINESS MODEL AND COUNTIES AROUND -- TRUE PARTNERSHIP WITH WITH A RESOURCE FAMILIES. AND WE'RE ENTERING INTO SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DAVE THOMAS FOUNDATION -- ABOUT THEIR WENDY'S WONDERFUL KIDS WHICH ALSO IS A CHILD SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT STRATEGY THAT WOULD BE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BRING ADDITIONAL RECRUITERS TO THE STATE [inaudible] OKAY. AND ANY OTHER COME AVAILABLE I KNOW YOU'RE GIVING A PRESENTATION OKAY THANK YOU COVERED IT OKAY FINANCE WITH. JUST REYES PART OF FINANCE AND I MANY MISTER ROSE -- AND ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE LAID ON THE AGENDA AS WE WOULD AGREE WITH AND JUST TO REITERATE THAT -- THE DAY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOESN'T PROPOSE ELIMINATING THE FLIPPERS FUNDING IT'S IT'S STILL MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT OF THE UP FRONT INVESTMENT AND THAT'S JUST TO MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION. OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- SO NOW WE HAVE MOVED TO THE PANEL WE HAVE -- DIRECTOR HERE -- VANESSA HERNANDEZ ALL RIGHT FROM -- CALIFORNIA'S COMMISSION BAG EASTER DAWSON OKAY I GUESS YOU GUYS COME ALIVE -- RATES NOVA COUNTY AND SET THE MONTH SAYS. ALL RIGHT. OKAY SO -- ONCE YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND BEGIN YES IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MAKE WITH CW DAY AND I'LL TRY TO BE. QUICK AND JUST HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS -- YOUR AGENDA DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OUTLINING -- HOW WISE AND AUDACIOUS AND -- IN SOME WAYS OVERWHELMING C. C. R. IS AND IT'S IT'S VERY EXCITING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE WORKING WELL FOR SOME THINGS ARE VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS AND HAVING A GOTTEN TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. THERE'S SOME AREAS WHERE WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERN IN EPPING GAUGE WITH THE STATE TO TRY TO PROBLEM SOLVE DURING% IMPLEMENTATION WHAT'S GOING WELL I THINK WE AGREE WITH MR ROSE SO I WON'T I WON'T RECOUNT IT -- THE GROUP HOME PLACEMENTS ARE DOWN WE BELIEVE CF TEAS ARE A MUCH BETTER WAY OF DOING CASE WORK WE THINK OUR AFFAIRS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO GET HIGH QUALITY. FAMILIES TO CARE FOR KIDS. THE THE DELAYS ARE STILL THERE THEY'RE GOING DOWN THE DELAYS ARE GOING DOWN AND WE'RE VERY MUCH CONCERNED. ABOUT THE ELIMINATION OF FUNDING FOR OUR FAA WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER -- WITH RESPECT TO JUST A COUPLE OF AREAS WHERE WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT WITH THE STATE -- WERE THINGS THAT HAVEN'T GONE EXACTLY AS WE'D HOPED -- THE FIRST IS GROUPON CONVERSIONS INTO S. T. R. T. PEAS -- AS OF TODAY -- JUST OVER HALF OF THE CHILDREN WHO -- ARE BEING -- SERVING CONGREGATE CARE ARE IN FACILITIES THAT HAVE NOT CONVERTED TO AN S. T. R. T. P. -- WHICH MEANS ONLY HALF OF THEM HAVE -- THOSE FACILITIES THEN ALSO ULTIMATELY ARE REQUIRED TO GET A MENTAL HEALTH CERTIFICATION IN A MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACT. MANY OF THE FACILITIES THAT HAVE NOT MADE IT THROUGH THE S. T. R. T. P. PIPELINE YET IN OUR OPINION. ARE ACTUALLY QUALITY PROVIDERS BUT THEY MAY BE SMALLER PROVIDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH BECOMING LICENSED AND THEN CERTIFIED AND THEN GETTING A MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTOR CONSIDERABLE. AND WE THINK THAT IT'S INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT WAYS TO DEVELOP. MORE INTENSIVE INTENTIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE HIGH QUALITY AND CAN PROVIDE EXCELLENT CARE. pHAVE UNTIL UNDER CURRENT LAW DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR -- AFTER WHICH CHILDREN WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE -- IN THOSE FACILITIES AND AND PARTICIPATE IN STATE FUNDING AND SO WE THINK THAT'S THE DATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RE VISIT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. THE SECOND AREA OF I THINK FOCUSING THINK WE AGREE WITH MR ROSE AGAIN. IS -- INTENSIVE FAMILY FINDING PARTICULARLY FOR FAMILIES. THAT CAN CARE FOR AND HELP CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA HE'LL -- THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO FULLY ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT CC ARE PROMISED FOSTER FAMILIES. WHO CARE FOR KIDS WITH SIGNIFICANT -- COMMA HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THERE ARE NO PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU LATER -- CHANGE TAKES TIME AND WERE VERY CONCERNED OVERALL ABOUT THE RUG BEING PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THAT SUPPORTS PREMATURELY. PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO FIBERS AN RFA [inaudible] X.. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S VANESSA HERNANDEZ AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. SEE WE SEE AS A YOUTH LED ORGANIZATION WHO EMPOWER WHO DEVELOP LEADERS TO EMPOWER EACH OTHER AND THEIR COMMUNITIES TO TRANSFORM. THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THROUGH POLICY PRACTICE IN LEGISLATIVE CHANGE. WHAT MAKES YOU A C. MOST UNIQUE IS THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE CURRENTLY IN CARE OR FORMALLY EIGHT IN CARE AND THEY DEVELOP THEY IDENTIFIED THE LARGEST GAPS ON THE WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND THEY DEVELOP THE SOLUTIONS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS? ON HOW TO IMPROVE THOSE. SEE WE SEE HAS BEEN ACTIVE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORMS FOR OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS -- WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY SOME OF THE BRIGHT SPOTS IN SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION WORK AND WE ARE ALSO HAVE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH TO SOME OF THE OTHER PIECES -- ONE OF THE BRIGHT SPOTS THAT WE'D LIKE -- TO SHOULD TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY IS THE TOM FAMILY TEAMS ARE WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGING EXCITED THAT THIS IS A NEW SYSTEMATIC WAY IF INCLUDING YOUNG PEOPLE'S VOICE AND FAMILY BOYS. IN A WAY THAT INFORMS ALL DECISIONS IN THEIR LIVES WE APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZING THEM AS EXPERTS IN THEIR OWN LIVES -- TODAY I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE C. C. R. COMPONENTS THAT WE VIEW IT'S ESSENTIAL TO THE REFORM. AND THAT ARE NEEDING THE MOST ATTENTION AND STRATEGY FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE DEPARTMENT AND THE COUNTIES -- I DO AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS SHARED BY BOTH MISTER ROSEN MISTER MET THEM -- ONE THING WE'D LIKE TO ELEVATE IN HIGHLY IN THE SETTING IS THAT THE STATE I'M NEEDS TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE HOW WE SUPPORT HOME BASE FOSTER HOMES. OR RESOURCE FAMILIES -- ENCOURAGE STABILITY IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE FAMILY'S EXPERIENCE -- WE WE'D LIKE TO HIGHLAND ELEVATE THAT THIS STABILITY GOES BEYOND DISPLACEMENT IT INCLUDES -- EDUCATIONAL STABILITY STABILITY AND RELATIONSHIPS AND STABILITY AND QUALITY SERVICES INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH -- ANOTHER WAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS POINT SPECIFICALLY IS THAT WE NEED BETTER SYSTEM COORDINATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND DELIVERING SERVICES THAT ARE QUALITY. CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY FOR OUR YOUTH AND OUR FAMILIES. THE OTHER THING WE'D LIKE TO ELEVATE IS THAT WE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE HOW WE LOOK AT THE FORMULA OF HOW WHEN AND WHY YOU THE END UP IN CONGREGATE CARE. WE KNOW THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY THESE YOUTH ARE OF COLOR WE KNOW THAT THESE YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE FIVE OR MORE POLICEMEN CHANGES AND MANY OF THEM IDENTIFIES LGBT Q. I EIGHT AND THEY ARE OLDER. SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FAIR PER PLANS AND WE LOOK AT HOW ARE IS THIS NEW MONEY BEING USED -- A PLANE AND EQUITY LANDS A BASED ON WHO THIS POPULATION IS IS VERY IMPORTANT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THIS MONEY IS BEING USED ON EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS. THAT IT IS EQUITY BASED AND THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TRAUMA THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. TO QUICKLY TOUCH ON THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS THAT IDEA IN THE VISION IS THAT THIS HAPPENS WITH IN LESS LESS THAN NINETY DAYS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CAN BE I'M A HEAVY ENDEAVOR AND OUR COMMENT THERE IS THAT BUREAUCRACY SHOULD NEVER DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND FAMILIES AND CARE. THE LAST COMMENT WE'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT A MAJOR PART OF CCR IS LOOKING AT ACCOUNTABILITY AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES OUTCOMES IN THAT THE I CQ WHY APPROACH. NEEDS TO BE APPLIED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT IN THE SAME BOAT WITH A NEW TYPE OF GROUP HOME IN FIVE YEARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY NEXT TRY TO KEEP IT WITHIN THREE MINUTES. RIGHT THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS STEPHANIE MONTEZ AND I'M A SUPERVISOR WITH CINEMA COUNTY FAMILY YOUTH AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES AND I SUPERVISE OUR CARE GIVER TREATMENT SUPPORT UNIT. BECAUSE QUALITY PARENTING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INVENTION THAT WE CAN PROVIDE YOU THINK CARE CINEMA COUNTY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN SERVICES LAUNCHED OUR CARE GIVER MENTORING PROGRAM IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CENTS THAN TEN SEASON RESOURCE PARENT MENTORS HAVE SUPPORTED FIFTY FIVE NEWLY APPROVED FAMILIES. THIS LEVEL PEER SUPPORT HAS BEEN VITAL AND PLACEMENT STABILITY AND HELPING CARE GIVERS NOT ONLY TO PROVIDE THE BEST QUALITY OF CARE FOR CHILDREN IN USE. BUT ALSO HELP THEM FEEL CONFIDENT AND STEPPING OUTSIDE THEIR COMFORT ZONE. TO CARE FOR CHILDREN A VERY NEEDS IN AGES FIBERS FUNDING HAS BEEN CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING THIS PROGRAM. THE PROFESSIONALISM OF OUR CARE GIVERS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE SUCCESS OF CCIR. CRISTINA CURRENT MENTOR SAYS. MY INTRODUCTION TO BEING AN APPROVED FOSTER PARENT WAS A CALL FROM MY MENTOR TO SAY WELCOME. LET'S GET TOGETHER I'M HERE TO HELP I INSTANTLY THOUGHT A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY I WASN'T ALONE AND HAD SOMEONE TO HELP NAVIGATE THE CONFUSING WORLD OF CHILD WELFARE. AND THEN WHEN THE TIME CAME THAT I WAS JUST BARELY STAYING AFLOAT MY MENTOR EMPOWERED ME TO FIND RESOURCES HAVE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I MAKING A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE EVEN WHEN IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS. I BECAME A MENTOR BAND BECAUSE I WANTED TO GIVE TO NEW FAMILIES THE SAME WELCOME AND SUPPORT THAT I WAS GIVEN. I BELIEVE WITH A STRONG SUPPORT NETWORK RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE AT FAMILY HAS THE IDEAL FOUNDATION TO BEST CARE FOR OUR YOUTH IN CARE. THE MENTOR PROGRAM IS A STRONG PILLAR OF THIS FOUNDATION AND I AM THANKFUL TO HAVE HAD A MENTOR AND I AM PROUD TO NOW PROVIDE. THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR NEW RESOURCE FAMILIES. WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR MENTOR ANOTHER ONE OF OUR FAMILIES WHO HISTORICALLY ONLY TOOK INFANTS AND TODDLERS. STEPPED OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE TO CARE FOR SIBLINGS TWO BOYS AND MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. THIS RESOURCE FAMILY WHO PROVIDED TEMPORARY CARE IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM OUT OF OUR EMERGENCY SHELTER. AND AND A FAMILY HOME ENDED UP CONNECTING WITH THESE BOYS IN A WAY THAT WE COULD HAVE NEVER ANTICIPATED. THEY MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOW WITH THEIR FOREVER FAMILY AND BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT THE FAMILY RECEIVED THESE BOYS HAVE YOU BEEN MORE CARING ADULTS IN THEIR HOME. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU -- CINEMA COUNTY HAS -- REALLY I THINK BENEFITTED FROM C. C. R. AND THE FIRST FUNDING BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS IT'S A LOT OF TO DO IS REALLY LOOK AT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP BASED WAY OF DOING CHILD WELFARE -- AND AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN OUR COUNTY IS FOUR YEARS AGO WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED CHILDREN CONGREGATE CARE. AND AS OF LAST MONTH WE WERE DOWN -- TO THIRTY AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT -- SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT IS THROUGH -- IMPROVED GATE KEEPING UP BY CREATING A COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWS CHILDREN THAT ARE -- AND APPROVED ANY CHILD THAT IS GOING TO GO IN A IS BEING CONSIDERED FOR CONGREGATE CARE AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT ARE OTHER OPTIONS. AND WHEN CHILDREN ARE READY TO STEP DOWN REALLY BEGINNING TO PLAN FOR THAT AHEAD OF TIME -- WE ALSO WITH THROUGH C. C. R. AND ALSO THROUGH FLIPPERS HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FAMILY FINING COLLABORATION WHICH IS EIGHT COUNTY BASED ON A COUNTY WIDE APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT SO WE WORK WITH OUR FFA IS IN OUR COUNTIES. IN OUR MARKETING AND RECRUITMENT -- WE DO COMBINED EVENTS WE DO COMBINED TRAINING AND SUPPORT GROUPS AND REALLY LOOK AT IT AS A COUNTY AGAIN IT'S THE IDEA OF RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AND CONNECTING TOGETHER TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN -- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF KIND OF A UNIQUE PROGRAM THAT WE'VE CREATED OUT OF C. C. R. AND WITH SUPPORT. FROM PEPPERS HAS BEEN A CO PARENTING MODEL -- AND THIS IS WHERE WE REALLY -- LOOK AT BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OUR BIRTH PARENTS BIRTH PARENTS AND RESOURCE PARENTS -- AND WE'VE DONE THIS THROUGH OUR BIRTH PARENT FOSTER PARENT PARTNERSHIP WHICH BRINGS A SOCIAL WORKER -- A FOSTER PARENT MENTOR -- AND BIRTH PARENT MENTOR TOGETHER -- TO REALLY HELPED BUILD THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BIRTH PARENT FOSTER PARENT AND THEY DO THIS THROUGH -- SHARED DECISION MAKING ON GOING COMMUNICATION AND REALLY KEEPING THE CHILD AT THE CENTER -- AND NO MATTER WHAT WAY THE CASE GOES -- THE CHILD IS ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL WHETHER THE PARENT RE UNIFIES OR IF WE HAVE ANOTHER PERMANENCY CHOICE FOR THAT KID -- BECAUSE THEY GET TO KEEP THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IMPORTANT IN THEIR LIVES PART OF THEIR LIVES AND SO -- WE SEE THAT A SUCCESS FOR THAT CHILD HOWEVER THE CASE GOES -- SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO UNDER C. C. R. IS IN -- DEVELOP THE CARE GIVER RECRUITMENT SUPPORT TEAM WHICH STEPHANIE -- OVERSEAS AND THAT REALLY ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES SO THAT WE CAN STRETCH THEM TO TAKE ON KIDS THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK OF OTHERWISE -- OR THAT THEY WERE AFRAID TO BUT NOW THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A MENTOR AND THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A TEAM. THEY'RE WILLING -- TO CONSIDER TAKING AND MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILD OR CONSIDER TAKING A SIBLING GROUP OR OLDER CHILDREN -- AND I BELIEVE THE FACT BECAUSE I COULD GO ON AND ON THANK YOU -- SO ACTUALLY -- IT'S WHAT CRITICS DIED IN AND OTHERS OF THE AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR SOME STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS LATER ON BUT SO THERE'S A LOT CONVERSATION ABOUT FAVORS AND THE MONEY AND DALY OF THE PIE CHART AND THE THING AND ACTUALLY WHILE MOST. WHILE. PERHAPS A LARGE PORTION GOES THE CARE GIVERS I MEAN IT'S STILL EVEN THAT PORTION IS NOT THAT THAT'S LIKE WHAT. TWENTY JOINT FRACTION OF IT SO IT'S MAYBE LIKE. TWENTY DAHLE CARRIER SUPPORTS PROBABLY. IN THE NASH TRAIN AT FIVE TESTS ABOUT QUARTER OF THAT MONEY SO TORRANCE. SAYING OH MY GOD THE MONEY'S GOING AWAY FOR PREFERS BUT WHAT EXACTLY SO WHAT HOW AND BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE'S OTHER MONIES IT'S COMING IN THAT'S THE DIRECTLY LIKE. CAN WE CLARIFY WHAT'S WHAT WHAT IS THE PLAN AND AROUND. THE OF USERS FOR THE TEMPORARY TO WRITE AND THEN -- SUPPOSE SO. CAN CAN -- CAN IT BE FOR ABSOLUTE SO YET YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT SO HOW. DOES IT DO THAT USE SAYING THAT WHILE YOU'RE STILL GAME I JUST GOT COME FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE OR USE THAT OUR HOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO WORK SO. EIGHT I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SAYS THAT THAT THE FIRST ONE IS AND IT'S IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA. A FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT RETENTION SUPPORT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON AND COUNTIES IN WAS INCLUDED IN PART AGAIN AND TO MENTION -- THE TWO THOUSAND THE REALIGNMENT SO COUNTIES OF ALWAYS BEEN RESPONSIBLE -- FOR FOR A LOT OF THAT WILL COME WITH PAPERS ACTIVITIES WHEN SIX HERE IS A WAS DEVELOPED ONE OF THE AGREEMENTS WAS IS BECAUSE WERE. WERE THE STATE'S LOOKING TO ELIMINATE GROUP HOMES AT A FASTER RATE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS UP FRONT INVESTMENT TO HELP ASSIST WITH THAT. WITH THE AND AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS LEGISLATURE ONE AT THE TIME IN AGREED -- THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE APPROACH THAT THERE WOULD BE THIS UPFRONT INVESTMENT TO HELP WITH THAT BECAUSE THESE ARE GONNA STILL BE -- ACTIVITIES THAT COUNTIES ARE GONNA RESPONSE WERE DOING GOING FORWARD -- SO -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS ENDS UP BEING ME COMING IN A AYE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY. WELL -- TO CONTINUE OR ADD ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES THAT WERE HAPPY. TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- BUT WE JUST AGAIN THAT WORK. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THIS RELATED FUNNY IN IS IS MAINTAINING THE AGREEMENT THE ESSENTIAL HOUSES ARE WAS GOING -- TO TO MOVE FORWARD. MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD I FROM THE COUNTY STANDPOINT WE SORT OF A GREEN PARDON DISAGREE IN PART -- THE THE IDEA THAT -- THERE WAS ALL IT WAS ALWAYS THE COUNTY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DO FOSTER PEREGRINE IT'S TRUE -- BUT THAT WAS WHEN THE LAWS DIDN'T PROSCRIBED THE USE OF CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES -- AND COMPLETELY CHANGE THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE. TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ALLOW THE COUNTIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING C. C. R. WHICH IS THE LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT I THINK CHANGED THE NATURE. OF WHAT THE OBLIGATIONS WERE BETWEEN THE STATE IN THE COUNTIES PRIOR. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I THINK THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT THE IDEA THAT FLIPPERS OR FOR THE ENHANCED FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT RETENTION IS SOMEHOW SOMETHING. THAT YOU ONLY NEED TO FUND UP FRONT AND THEN ONCE THAT HAPPENS WERE GOOD -- IT'S FLAWED. LARGELY BECAUSE MANY OF THE FAMILIES THAT WERE RECRUITING AND SUPPORTING A RELATIVE CARE GIVERS. AND WE ASK THEM TO COME INTO -- OUR SYSTEM IN CARE FOR THEIR CAN IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY WERE LOOKING TO DO WE KNOCKED ON THEIR THE IT ON THEIR DOOR. VERY FEW OF THEM WHEN THAT CHILD REACHES PERMANENCY OR REACHES MAJORITY SAYS. HEY I'VE BEEN RECRUITED THAT USED PEPPERS MONEY I'M GOING TO STAY IN THE POOL AND SO. THE NEED FOR A HIGH A NUMBER OF HIGH QUALITY FAMILIES TO CARE FOR CHILDREN GIVEN THAT MANY OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE RELATIVES MEANS THE WORK NEVER ENDS. THE INTENSITY OF THE ON GOING WORK NEVER ENDS AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT THE PREMISE THAT SOMEHOW FLIPPERS. IS A STATE OBLIGATION THAT ENDS AT SOME POINT IS CONSENT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE KNOW TO BE THE WAY C. C. R. IS ROLLING OUT. OKAY -- COMING FROM [inaudible] THE NEED. SUCH SERVICE TO THAT -- I THINK EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD IS IS CRACKED -- I I THINK THOUGH IT'S A MISTAKE. THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER THINGS ALTHOUGH WE BUDGET THEM BY LINE ITEM TO THINK THAT TE TOTALITY NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED AS AS INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH -- C. C. R. WAS NEVER INTENDED AS A FISCAL COST SAVING MEASURE. IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND FIRMLY ROOTED IN THE BELIEFS REFLECTED LATER IN THE FEDERAL LAW FF PSA THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER -- THAT KIDS ARE BETTER IN HOME BASED FAMILY CARE SITUATIONS RATHER THAN CONGREGATE CARE SITUATIONS ALTHOUGH THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE ROLE OF COURSE FOR CONGREGATE CARE AS WELL. BUT DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY SOME HAD ALREADY VERY LOW RATES OF CONGREGATE CARE -- CONGREGATE CARE ALSO TENDS TO BE VASTLY MORE EXPENSIVE -- IN PART BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO TREATMENT NEEDS OR THE SERVICE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES -- AND THE REDUCTION IN THAT CONGREGATE CARE ALSO PROVIDES A IS A REDUCTION IN PLACEMENTS AND CONGREGATE CARE NOT ONLY PROVIDES IMMEDIATE MONTH TO MONTH FISCAL SAVINGS RELATIVE TO A HOME BASED PLACEMENT. BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAN A CONVERSATION ABOUT PLACEMENT STABILITY. PLACEMENT DURATION. OF THE LIFE OUTCOMES OF THE USE AND THE NUMBER OF ACES THAT THEY'RE EXPOSED. TO THE NUMBER OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT MAY BE ENDED OR MAINTAINED SO I I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO THINK ABOUT. INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS ALTHOUGH THEY'RE IMPORTANT -- WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON THE OUTCOMES WERE TRYING TO WILL SHE EVEN FIGURE OUT WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THERE AS A WHOLE PACKAGE. I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN PART OF MY QUESTION IS IS REALLY COMES DOWN TO OKAY WELL WE HAVE A CERTAIN DREAM AND STRUCTURE. IN TERMS OF HOW WE LABEL DIFFERENT. PIECES OF MONEY [inaudible] CURRENTLY AND LIVING. FOR STATE SO AND THE VALUES YOU SEE THIS PART SHARDS THEY WILL WORDS MAY ACTUALLY GO AND IT'S GOING TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND THE QUESTION IS IS THAT. IS THE TOTAL LEVEL SUPPORT. NECESSARY THERE AND MAYBE IF. WE MORE SPECIFICALLY LABEL LIKE OKAY WELL WE'RE GOING TO BOOST MONEY UP HERE FOR THIS PURPOSE AND SO FORTH BUT THAT. THE GUY A ON VERSES LIKE -- WELL ENOUGH SO WE REDUCING THIS AND WE'RE INCREASING THIS ONLY JUST REDUCING THIS. RIGHT AND CERTAINLY I THINK THE THE SPEAKS TO THE NEED -- FOR SAID YOU RECRUITING FAMILIES THEY NEED TO KNOW THE SUPPORT IS THERE A DATE DATE. IT'S IT'S NOT THAT'S GOING TO GO AWAY AND THERE'S ALWAYS NEW FAMILIES RIGHT THERE'S UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NEW KIDS TO ENTER TO SYSTEM AND THERE'S NEW FOSTER FAMILIES AND I THINK IT IS I JUST HAVE TO SAY IN THE SHORT RUN. THE URGENT QUESTION AS ARE THE RESOURCES GOING TO BE THERE FOR COUNTIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL TO IMPLEMENT THE STATE MANDATES. IF IN A IF IN A LONGER RUN OR MEDIUM TERM RUN THE STATE WANTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE COUNTIES ABOUT. CHANGING THE NATURE OF HOW WE FIND ON AN ONGOING BASIS C. C. R.. THAT THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE WE CAN'T REDEFINED PROP. THIRTY THAT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION -- BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WORK WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF PROP THIRTY IN TALK ABOUT. DIFFERENT MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO FUND THE PROGRAM TO GET THE OUTCOMES MAKE WE WANT WE SAY. ABSOLUTELY BUT IN THE SHORT RUN I'M TELLING YOU FROM THE COUNTY STANDPOINT IF WE PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER OUR A FANFIC PERS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SUCCEED. YOU KNOW I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE SUPPORT WHAT'S CONTAINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND AND BUT WE'RE ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THE WORLD IS NOT STATIC AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. YOU DON'T GET KIDS OUT OF CONGREGATE CARE WITHOUT HOME BASE PLACEMENTS TO PUT THEM IN THAT'S WHAT THE FLIPPERS MONEY WAS ALL ABOUT. MISTER MAC IS EXACTLY RIGHT. NOT ONLY ARE THE MORE OF THEM RELATIVES BUT WE NEED MORE OF THEM PERIOD THAN PREVIOUSLY THEY HAD. AND ARE RFA FUNDING THAT YOU THAT THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL TO GET THEM TO BE APPROVED PLACEMENTS IS A SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD AND THERE'S A BACKLOG THERE. AND WE HAVE BEEN ADDING FUNDING AS WE GO ALONG TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT WE SEE EMERGENCY C. R. IMPLEMENTATION CONTINUES OKAY. AND THE OTHER GUESTS -- QUESTION DOES BROUGHT UP WAS ABOUT -- IN GROUP HOMES FOR ONLY HALF OF THEM ARE NOW -- QUALIFY TO BE STR TNCS [inaudible] AND THAT'S HOW WE HELP THE OTHER. HALF THAT ARE GOOD WHOCOMES BUT IN A WAY HAVE CHALLENGES BECAUSE THE SCALE SIZE RESOURCES ETCETERA. ARE WE RIGHT NOW OUR OUR OUR TEAM. AND OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND OFTEN THE ASSOCIATIONS AND FRANKLY THE COUNTIES WHO HAVE WRITTEN LETTERS OF SUPPORT FOR THE VARIOUS -- PROGRAMS ARE HAVE TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS TO TRY TO REDEFINE REFINE THE PROGRAM STATEMENTS THAT IT MEETS THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THAT WAS INTENDED SO THAT THAT WE CAN THAT WERE -- THAT WORSE WE FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO TO TO TO SERVE THAT THE YOUNG PERSON WITH THAT LEVEL OF NEED THAT IS WHAT IS SUGGESTED BY. A BEFORE THREE SO WE'RE HAVE A WE HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF OUR STAFF AND SOME CONSULTANTS WORKING -- ALONG SIDE -- ARE A NUMBER OF THE PROVIDERS AS WERE -- IN AND ENTER IT GREG LIVE IT SENATOR TO PROCESS AND AT SOME LEVEL PAINFUL FOR ALL ALL ALL PARTIES BUT IT'S REALLY INTENDED TO BE REALLY CLEARLY -- IT A WAY TO DO THAT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT FOLKS TAKE BEFORE GIVE SOMEBODY A LICENSE THAT WE KNOW THEY CAN SUPPORT THAT THAT LEVEL OF NEED. AND BECAUSE WERE FOLKS WE'RE NOT WE'RE FLAT WERE FOCUSING MORE ON OUTCOME AND QUALITY THAN WE DID IN THE PAST WE WANNA HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE TO IS THE PROGRAM STATEMENT IN WHICH THEY THE STATE THEY WROTE. THIS IS HOW WE DO OUR WORK THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET OUR OUTCOMES AND RATHER THAN JUST GOING IN AND KIND OF COUNTING WIDGETS AND COUNTING PROCESSES WE WANT TO BE ABLE. TO SAY YOU THIS IS HOW YOU GO ABOUT YOUR WORK AND SO WE IT HAS BEEN AN ARDUOUS PROCESS NO DOUBT WE ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE SOME PROVIDERS THAT HAVE. MADE OTHER CHOICES -- AND SOME JUST PROVIDERS THAT WE HAVE AT I TALKED WITH ABOUT MAKING OTHER CHOICES [inaudible] OKAY. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO I KNOW. THE PRESENTED ABOUT -- IN TERMS OF YEAH THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVAL WITH THESE ARE THERE SPECIFIC THINGS THE I MEAN IS THERE A WAY TO WEAKEN. HELP THE ONES WHO ARE INTERESTED -- WHO MAY HAVE FEW RESOURCES GET THAT KIND OF APPROVAL AND A WHAT KIND OF BARRIERS ARE ARE TO TO THAT PIECE OF IT? I MEAN THAT'S WHY I THINK WITH OUR CONVENIENCE WERE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT TRYING TO GET TA OUT TO THE COUNTIES IN THE PROVIDERS TO HELP THEM WITH THOUGHT AND WE HAVE OUR REVIEWERS ON YOU KNOW WE HAD LATELY ASK ANOTHER QUESTION AND AND RELATE THAT AND I DON'T. KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE THE ANSWER ONE OF THE OTHER FANS SO -- IS THAT YOU TRY TO GET T. A.'S OUT TO THESE PEOPLE IS THAT. ARE THEY FEELING LIKE A T. A.'S HELPFUL ENOUGH THIRTY GETTING ENOUGH SUPPORT. ON THAT PIECE. THERE'S ONLY NINETEEN AS TIER TEEPEES HAVE MET ALL THE MENTAL HEALTH QUALIFICATIONS. NINETEEN IN THE STATE HAS NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES -- OKAY IT'S THE THAT CAPACITY TO DO PROPER BILLING AND DOCUMENTATION AND IT'S IT IT'S YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT IT'S A LOT OF WORK AND IT'S DIFFICULT AND I APPRECIATE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONVENING. BUT IT'S OUR OBSERVATION THAT IT NOW IT'S TIME TO DO A LITTLE MORE. HAND IN HAND. FACILITY SPECIFIC -- TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BUILD OFF OF THE MORE GENERAL. SORT OF WEAPON OUR SYMPOSIA TO SAY. WE THINK THESE FACILITIES ARE GOOD THESE ARE THESE THESE CAN BE HEALING PLACES FOR CHILDREN. LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP THEM SPECIFICALLY AND IT'S THAT TYPE OF I THINK INTENSIVE SUPPORT FOR THIS FOR THIS GROUP OF FACILITIES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE STATE. AND THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY I'M TO HELP THOSE FACILITIES ARE YOU JUST THE RIGHT IN ITS NINETEEN OUT HOW MANY. THERE'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM INTEND RIGHT YES RIGHT. OKAY BUT NOT LIVE AT NINETY OKAY SO CAN CAN CAN YOU SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU MY NUMBER SO OKAY. AS OF APRIL FIFTH -- WE'VE RECEIVED -- A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE APPLICATIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVALS OKAY -- WE'VE CONDUCTED NINETY EIGHT REVIEWS OF THE NINETY EIGHT REVIEWS OF SIXTY SIX MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVALS HAVE BEEN GRANTED THESE ARE FOR S. T. OPPORTUNITIES IT JUST. I DON'T KNOW FOR THOMAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT WAS. MY POINT WAS TO MEETING ALL THREE MENTAL HEALTH REQUIREMENTS WHICH INCLUDES GETTING A CONTRACT. AND IT TO THE CONTRACTOR OKAY. SO SO SO THIS IS A SILLY SORT OF THAT HAVE PASSED THE MENTAL HEALTH APPROVAL THEY'VE GOTTEN MEDI CAL CERTIFIED AND THEY HAVE A CONTRACT. WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN OKAY THAT'S NINETY EIGHT NINETEEN AND YOU YOU HAVE PROBABLY THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO. MAY NOT YET HAVE A CONTRACT AFTER THE OKAY. WELL LET ME JUST. SO -- ABOUT DEADLINE SO WHAT'S THE GOAL LIKE END OF THE YEAR WERE SHOULD BE VIçT. LIKE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN HOW MANY PEOPLE SHOULD BE WHERE. AT THIS IS NOT MEANT TO SOUND SORT OF TRIED BUT IT SHOULD BE EVERYBODY THAT WE NEED OR WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME PROCESS FOR AN EXTENSION FOR THOSE FACILITIES THAT. WE CONTINUE TO THINK -- SHOULD BE PLACES FOR CHILDREN BUT WHO WE CAN'T. CAN'T GET ACROSS THE LINE BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR YES DCS WHAT'S I MEAN. OBVIOUSLY THE CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. OF IT YEAH SO RIGHT SO RIGHT THAT THAT THAT'S NOT YOUR PIECE OF IT OBVIOUSLY WE WE CAN TALK TO THE HERE FOR ALL DIRECTORS ABOUT THAT BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR PIECE OF IT. ARE YOU PLAYING ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO QUOTE ARE YOU GET EVERYBODY BY THE END OF THE YEAR ARE WELL WE'RE WE'VE BEEN WORKING JUST APPLICATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING AND WORKING WITH THE COUNTY SO AND IT REALLY JUST COMES ON AND AS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW. IF THEY'RE PASSING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS TO GET THE APPROVAL AND TO GET THE CERTIFICATION SO WE'RE PROVIDING ALL THE TA THAT WE CAN TO THE COUNTIES TO GET THEM READY TO GO AND AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM SO. OKAY HERE COUNTIES AND HERE'S THE GROUP. SO I MEAN I THAT IS THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND THE HAVE TO CONTRACT WITH THE S. T. R. T. P. PROVIDERS IN A WEEK I MEAN ASIDE FROM T. A AND I WAS THAT'S IMPORTANT OUR OUR IS THERE SOME MINOR CHANGE FROM IS AFRAID. LIKE. SO WE KNOW SOLD BY THE END OF THE YEAR WE KNOW HOW THAT THE ART OF WHAT WHAT KIND OF INCENTIVES ARE THINGS ARE GETTING TOO SO THAT THE MONITORING. HOW MANY ARE ACTUALLY HAVING CONTRACTS WITH? OKAY YOU TELL HOW TO GET A CONTRACTOR TO ACTUALLY CONTRACTING. I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION I I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES INTO IT SO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT THERE'S THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT STOPS AND REMEMBER I'M WE CAN TALK ABOUT AND WE TALK ABOUT THAT IN AN H. P. ENOUGH HOW WE CONTRACT WITH THEM. BUT YOU KNOW IMAGE PEAS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONTRACT THEY HAVE SELECTIVE PROVIDER CONTRACTING BUT THE CCR MODEL IS FOR US TO YOUR TWO PEAS DUE TO HAVE A GUEST HERE TO PEACE CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT THESE -- THE SEE THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU I KNOW I CAN'T EXIST WITHOUT THEM YEAH THE IN YOUR SIR TELLING ME WELL THE OF EXCLUSIVE CONTRACTS AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO CONTRACT SO. AND THE RIGHT PIECES HAVE TO BE IN PLACE SO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATION IN PLACE THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM APPROVAL IN PLACE AND I THINK -- FOR A LOT OF THESE S. T. R. T. P. IS THEY'RE NOT USED THIS IS ALL THE NEW PROGRESS WELL OKAY SO SO SO. WHAT I'M? SORRY ON THE OUT OF ANY OF YOUR OF TRAINS. YOU KNOW I'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT AN ITEM THAT AND WHEN DID YOU START TWENTY TO START GETTING APPLICATIONS HOW LONG THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU CITY GOT. NINETY EIGHT SIXTY SIX I MEAN THIS IS SINCE LAST YEAR ALONE SO THIS IS THE WHOLE YEAR. ANNUALLY THIS FAR. WHAT IT IS NOW APRIL? THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE LICENSE AND I KNOW I GET IT RIGHT OKAY WELL I I GUESS I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THAT WE'RE GONNA END UP BY. ANDERSON THE TWENTY NINETEEN I MEAN I AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT DEADLINES NOW DO YOU TO CHANGE SOME DEADLINES OR WHAT OVER ARE WE ARE GOING TO BE -- IT DOES DEADLINES. ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF WE'RE GONNA FIND OURSELVES LIKE OH MY GOD WE ONLY HAVE A HANDFUL OF THIS YEAR PEAS AVAILABLE AND EVERYONE ELSE IS OUT NOW AND WE'RE YEAH I THINK. IT'S OF CAUSING CONCERN. OKAY I WON'T LET. CONCERNED OKAY ARE YOU CONCERNED OKAY I'M GOOD YOUNG CONCERNED OKAY. I I THINK THERE WERE ALL DAY THERE'S CLEARLY THERE IS -- THERE EVERYBODY IS IS CONCERNED I THINK WHAT. THE THE THE LAW LAID OUT THIS KIND OF LINEAR PROCESS YOU GET YOUR LICENSE FIRST THAT YOU GO THROUGH THIS OTHER STUFF. THAT THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE LICENSE THEN WE DO HAVE WITH MENTAL HEALTH APPROVAL EVEN APPLICATIONS AND IS THERE IS A LINEAR PROCESS AND I DO THINK -- WE WOULD WE WOULD WE CAN AND SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE AND IF THERE IS IF WE IF IF WE CAN'T WE CAN'T -- YOU KNOW WITH THEIR THERE'S NO INTENTION TO THROW YOU YOUNG PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREET THERE'S NO INTENTION. TO TO IT IT TO TO DO TO DO HARM I THINK SO WE WE MAY HAVE TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW IF IF WE EXTENDED GROUP HOMES A LOT LONGER WHAT WOULD THE CRITERIA. BE AND WHAT WOULD THE ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE BE SO THAT WAY THAT WE COULD GET TO A A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE. PLACES FOR CHILDREN TO LIVE AND AND I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THAT'S PARTLY WILL OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE THE COUNTIES IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THERE IS A REAP THERE'S A THERE'S AN THAT REQUIREMENT. THAT SWEET YOU KNOW HOW IS THAT IT'S A KNOWN AS YOU KNOW THIS -- PART TO DATE AND PART OF THAT IS WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES -- TO COOK WE'VE CALL IT WE WERE OUT OF COLLECTING DATA TO TURN TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS THE CAPACITY NEED. FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTION IN TERMS OF ITS CONGREGATE CARE NEEDS IT'S IT'S HOME BASE NEEDS IT CETERA AND THEN HOW CLOSE TO THAT THAT MARK ARE EACH ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES -- AND HOW AND HOW CAN WE FACILITATE -- THE THAT EXPEDITING YOU KNOW THE THE PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN GET FOLKS LICENSE YOU NEED TO BE LICENSE. SO WHAT I I THINK WE'RE IN IT WERE IN A PROCESS NOW TO IT IDENTIFY. BECAUSE ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS IS HOW WE KNOW WE HAD THE RIGHT NUMBER AND FRANK SAYS WE ABSTRACT SAYS WE NEED WHAT WE NEED AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE WE HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH WERE WORKING. TO TRY TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE CAPACITY NEEDS ARE IF THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO POTENTIALLY LOOK AT A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW DEADLINE FOR CONVERSION I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT IT WOULD LIKELY WE NEEDS TO COME WITH SOME KINDS OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EVERYONE AT THE TABLE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL DOING WERE SUPPOSED TO DO ALL RIGHT THAT IT GET IT SO. I KNOW IN THE PAST WILL CERTAINLY I A AGAIN. AGREE WITH THE OVERALL GOAL ABOUT THAT IDEALLY YES EVERY FOSTER YOUTH YOU KNOW IN A HOME ETCETERA ALL RIGHT. AB. THE VOICE HAD SOME CONCERNS FEATURE XIN IS TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN BEHAVIORAL ISSUES THAT -- BY SAID WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP ON ANYONE I EIGHT YEAH I WONDER ABOUT [inaudible] THE YEAH EXACTLY ESPECIALLY JUST ARE GAINES -- TO YEAH MORE SEVERE SITUATIONS IT'S AT RENDON I MEAN AND AND AND AND AND I APPRECIATE ALL APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK AND AND AND AND FAMILY FINING AND SO FORTH -- FOR TO FOSTER PARENTS AND YOU KNOW THE THE ELEVEN DAY THEY THEY ARE ANGELS AND THEY PUT UP WITH A LOT. RIGHT AND THEY NEED A LOS SUPPORTS -- BUT ALSO AND NO WONDERING LIKE. HOW REALISTIC IT IS TO GET ALL OF THEM OUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHY DON'T WANT TO DO IS CREATE A BUREAUCRATIC IMPERATIVES THAT'S WHY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT? RIGHT BECAUSE I AM SYSTEM WITH OF COURSE UP HERE WE'D MAKE POLICIES AND DEADLINES AND STUFF LIKE THAT WE CREATE A BUREAUCRATIC IMPERATIVES THAT DOESN'T PLAY OUT IN REAL LIFE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS AND AND I KNOW YOUR INTENTION IS NOT TO YOU KNOW. AND BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE YOU KNOW FOSTER USE ADDRESSED. YOU KNOW AND AND AND AND AND AND AND SO FORTH AND AND AND BECAUSE WE ARE WE'RE PULLING OUT THE RUG UNDER. STATE AND IN DOWN UNDER SITUATED SO. I DON'T WHY AMAZON HEARING IS LIKE YES WE HAVE A MODEL AND IT IT. SOUNDS GREAT AND IT DID AND SO FORTH BUT TERMS OPERATIONALLY RIGHT WHERE ARE WE ON THESE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND THAT WHILE. AND IT'S FOUR AND WE NEED TO BE SURE WITH THE CAPACITY TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE KIDS AND AND SO I AM I'M JUST. YEAH ACES ABOUT OKAY WE HAVE THIS MODEL WE HAVE THIS YEAR FEES WE NEED TO MOVE THESE OR OVER THERE BUT WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GETTING PEOPLE CONTRACTS IN TIME YEAH YES THEY SHOULD HAVE MENTAL HOW IT'S IT'S NOT DISAGREEING WITH WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE. IT'S MORE ABOUT OUR WILL WE DO WE HAVE THE THINGS IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE WE ACTUALLY LAND THERE AND AND WE DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT GUESS WHAT YOU MISSED THE DEADLINE SO TOO BAD AND YOU KNOW AT THAT AND AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS ALL THE KIDS ARE IN THAT. SYSTEM SO -- SUCH THAT EIGHT AT NINE AM FEELINGS BECAUSE IT AVOIDS IDEA ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHEN WE QUOTE HOLD SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE IS IT THE PERSON WHO'S ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE OR IS ACTUALLY THE MAIN PERSON WHO GETS HURT AS THE PERSON WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING. AND I WILL BE SURE THAT THAT'S THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN I KNOW YOU ALSO AGREE WITH THAT TOO BUT I SO I WANTED SIDE I'M JUST REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. IS THAT AND IS ADDING SOCIETY MISPLACED OR NOT. NOT IN EVERY MONTHLY SEAT EVERY DAY BOARD MEETING [inaudible] OKAY. IT'S YES IT'S QUITE CHAIRED. YOU SAID YES I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM EVERYBODY AROUND THE TABLE NOBODY WANTS KIDS HEARD AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN I CAN TELL YOU -- THE STAFF SOME OF WHICH WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA IN THE NEXT ITEM. OUR E. SENSUAL INVOLVED PARTIES IN THE ON GOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THERE WERE REFERENCE TO PART TWO THERE'S ATTACHMENT A DATA WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT KIDS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN CONGREGATE CARE. HAVE INDIVIDUALIZED REPORTS COMING TO THE STATE ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF SERVICES. FOR FOR THE YOUTH THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING LOW NEEDS THAT ARE IN FACILITIES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS MAYBE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHERS TO ULTIMATELY BE SUCCESSFUL IN A TRANSITION. THE PRIORITY HAS BEEN FINDING HOME BASED CARE LOCATIONS FOR THOSE LOWER NEEDS KIDS TO REDUCE THE OVERALL NEED FOR STR TEEPEES AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE WORKING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF OVERTIME WITH OUR STAFF. TO HELP GET AT PEOPLE WITH POOR PEOPLE FOR FACILITY APPLICATIONS FOR STR TEEPEES THROUGH THE PIPELINE GET THE LICENSE. I KNOW THE SAME IS TRUE -- FOR FOR BRENDA GRAY ALICIA IT DH CS AND HER TEAM. YOU KNOW MOVING THOSE APPLICATIONS THERE ARE MODEL CONTRACTS FOR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND THE INDIVIDUAL STR TEEPEES. THAT COULD BE USED TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS WHERE SOME PEOPLE ARE STOCK AND WHERE THEY ARE STUCK THERE ARE ONGOING EFFORTS AMONG ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED AND CB HDA. TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND MEDIATE INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS SO I DON'T WANT YOU LEFT WITH WE'RE SPINNING OUR WHEELS WALKING UP TO THE DEADLINE AND NOT MUCH IS HAPPENING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT THE PHONE. BUT WE'RE ALL PANICKED THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THE DEADLINE AND IT IS EVERYTHING THAT. AND SO SO I GUESS I WANT TO SAY IS THAT IS THAT. THAT DEADLINES ARE GOOD ON ONE LEVEL BUT ALSO -- BECAUSE AND OFTEN TIME I'M UP HERE ASKING WHEN YOU'RE GONNA GET SOMETHING DONE SO I DID -- BUT I I THE WHITE LIGHT PARTICULARLY WANT TO BE SURE IS THAT IF THERE'S DEADLINES DO THE REGULATORY ISSUES YOU WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WAIVE THAT IS IF THEY WERE NOT GOING TO GET THERE AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING IN LAW THAT I NEED TO FIX. IN STATUTE THEN I AND YOU NEED TO TELL ME BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS I DON'T WANT SOMEONE TURNING AROUND AND SAY OH BY THE WAY THE LOSS SAID AND LEGISLATURE PASSED SO GUESS WHAT. TOO BAD WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE AND AND SO. YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A LEGAL STATUTE THAT NEEDS TO NEEDS TO BE. ADJUSTED TO CREATE GIVE YOU THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO TELL WE DON'T RUN INTO A WALL. ON THE LAWMAKER HERE TELL ME OKAY I MEAN I NEED TO KNOW RIGHT I NEED TO KNOW I NEED TO BUILD COMMUNICATE TO MY COLLEAGUES I DON'T THE DINNERS WITH THAT THAT'S I TALK ABOUT THE BUREAUCRATIC COMPARED IT RIGHT. AS I KNOW LEVEL WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO BUT LET'S ALSO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T CREATE A SITUATION WHERE. EVERYONE'S LIKE I WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT THE LAW THE REGULATIONS MAKE ME DO SOMETHING THAT I KNOW ISN'T GOING TO BE HAPPEN. SO THAT.

TO HELP THOSE THOSE GOOD FACILITIES THAT ARE STILL PENDING AND THE OTHER THING I'VE THAT I WANT TO UNDERSCORE AGAIN ISM WHEN WE PASSED C. C. R.. A KEY -- PLACEMENT IDEA FOR THOSE YOUTH VETERAN THOSE LOWER LEVEL GROUP HOMES WITH TREATMENT FOSTER CARE.

AND HAVE AND HAVE KIND OF TAKEN OFF HIM PROVIDED THAT -- SUPPORT THAT'S NEEDED -- AS PLACEMENT SPECIFIC -- RECRUITMENT -- FAMILY FINDING THOSE ARE. TWO AND PIECES OF THAT -- OF THAT PROPOSAL THAT HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL THAT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE OF FOR THE CHILDREN THAT STILL NEED TO STEP OUT OF CONGREGATE CARE. SO THAT IS -- HIGH LEVEL AND INTENSIVE WORK THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN SUCCESSFUL WE KNOW THAT IT WORKS. AND IT PUT IT -- HELPS SUPPORT -- PLACEMENTS ABILITY AND AND AND WE'RE NOT AT A PLACE OBVIOUSLY WHERE WE CAN -- WE CAN STOP THAT WORK AND WE NEED THAT CONTINUED INVESTMENT ALSO WITH AND PARENT SUPPORT -- WE WANT TO RETAIN OUR CURRENT CARE GIVERS AND ESPECIALLY AND AS IT HAS BEEN NOTED. ON FOSTER FAMILIES ARE TAKING AND MUCH HIGHER NEED KIDS WITHOUT THAN. NECESSARILY THE SUPPORT IN PLACE THAT IS NEEDED SO WE DEFINITELY NEED MORE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. LIKE CINEMA COUNTY AT THE RESOURCE FAMILY LIAISONS A LOT OF THE WORK THAT AND COUNTIES HAVE DONE THAT'S BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ANY COMMENTS FROM FORCES SERVICES ON THIS NOW ALL RIGHT ALEJO [inaudible] FINANCE. JUST REYES FINANCE JUST BLANKET TO LATER THAT YOU HAD A POSITION ON ANY PER -- PROPOSAL OUTSIDE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT OKAY NEXT ONE IS -- FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE -- CW A BELIEVE SOMEONE FROM STE. OKAY [inaudible] AMERICA. WE KEEP YOU BUSY HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MAKE UP. THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS WERE IN SUPPORT. OF A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY MILLION ON GOING TO FUND THE FAMILY URGENT -- ROOF -- RESPONSE SYSTEM. IT WAS IN A BIPARTISAN BILL LAST YEAR THAT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY DID NOT GET SIGNED BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE THE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET. BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT. THE CONCEPT IS BASICALLY -- A RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND THEIR CARE GIVERS A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN HOTLINE TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE SUPPORT THEY NEED WHEN ISSUES ARISE IN THE HOME THAT THREATEN THE STABILITY OF THE PLACEMENT. FURTHER INCLUDE TWO COMPONENTS A STATEWIDE HOTLINE STAFFED BY INDIVIDUALS ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED TO PROVIDE TRAUMA BASE SUPPORT AND CRISIS INTERVENTION. AND IF NECESSARY ALSO A MOBILE RESPONSE TEAMS THAT ARE ORGANIZED BY COUNTIES TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE IN HOME DE ESCALATION IN SUPPORT. TO YOUTH ENTER THEIR CARE GIVERS ONCE THAT RESPONSE OCCURS THE TEAM AND THEN LINK THE YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH. AN EXISTING CONTINUUM OF LOCAL SERVICES. SEE SEE OUR ENVISIONED A CONTINUUM OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND OTHER SUPPORTS THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED ON A TIMELY BASIS FOR FAMILIES. IN A AND CHILDREN IN THEIR HOMES SERVICES AND SUPPORTS BROUGHT TO CARE GIVERS IN YOUTH REGARDLESS OF THE PLACEMENT SETTING. UNFORTUNATELY CCR DID NOT CREATE A STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT PREDICATE. PURCHASED THE STRUCTURE NEEDED TO MAKE THAT CALL THE REALITY. AND MOMENTS OF TENSION OR POTENTIAL CRISIS BETWEEN CARE GIVERS IN YOUTH THE CURRENT SYSTEM SIMPLY ISN'T STRUCTURE TO RESPOND TO THEIR IMMEDIATE NEEDS FOR ASSISTANCE. AS A RESULT YOU THINK CARE GIVERS OFTEN END UP CALLING ONE FORSMAN. BECAUSE THEY LACK OTHER MORE APPROPRIATE TOOLS FOR IMMEDIATE HELP WHICH RESULT IN INAPPROPRIATE CRIMINALIZATION OF TRAUMATIZED YOUTH AND OFTEN LEADS TO SEPARATION OF CARE GIVERS AND YOU FOR PLACEMENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED. WITH APPROPRIATE SUPPORTS. PERSONAL FILL A GAP THAT CCR DIDN'T ADDRESS SOME WILL PROMOTE TRAUMA HEALING FOR YOUTH AND CARE GIVERS AND FOR THESE REASONS OR COALITION OF SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS URGES YOU IN THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THIS BUDGET REQUEST. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM THE FARM SOCIAL SERVICES. THE STATE BOTH THIS ONE AND THE PREVIOUS ONE AND CLEARLY ARE AT VALUE CARE GIVERS WE WEEK AS AS AS MISTER PHRASES THE MINISTRATIONS OF THE POSITION ON THESE VENTURE THE BECOME A ANY KIND OF LEGISLATIVE INTERESTS WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. TO ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OKAY ALL RIGHT ELIA COMMENTS NOW FINANCE RIGHT. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH. THE NEXUS -- FAMILY RESEARCH RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL IN KANSAS ASSESSMENT AND WE HAVE THE THEIR OKAY AREA BACK. WE TALKED WE TALKED AT SOME LENGTH ABOUT THIS IS THE OVERVIEW PANEL WE DID -- THE RESEARCHFAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS -- IS AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY OF APPROVING RELATIVES IT SHOWS GREAT PROMISE. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A CARE GIVER THAT REALLY KNOWS THE CHILD AND THAT CAN CONNECT WITH THE CHILD IN THE AN APPROPRIATE LONG TERM PLACEMENT FOR A CHILD IF NECESSARY THE PROCESS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE OLD PROCESS THERE IS A PRETTY. LONG BACKLOG IN GETTING ALL OF OUR RESOURCE FAMILIES THROUGH -- THE BUDGET -- DOES NOT CONTINUE THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED LAST YEAR. AND GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT ARE A FAIT IS TO THE SUCCESS OF C. C. R. WE'RE REQUESTING AN EXTENSION OF OUR FAA SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK. ON THAT SO IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF C. C. R.. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PARSER SERVICES I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD THAT FROM OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION THAT'S RIGHT OKAY L. L. [inaudible] FINANCE [inaudible] RIGHT. OKAY NEXT IS -- CONTINUED EMERGENCY CARE GIVER FUNDING AT TIME OF PLACEMENT AND THAT IS ANDY SCHWARTZ FROM THE LINES FOR SHOWS RIGHTS WELCOME. HI ESSENTIALLY TOWARDS POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AND I APPRECIATE THE EARLIER DISCUSSION. ON THIS ISSUE AND YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW ABOUT THE LENGTH OF TIME WITH THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS THE EMERGENCY CARE GIVER PROGRAM WAS CREATED LAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO A CRISIS. BEING FACED BY OUR RELATIVES AND EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ACCEPT PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL BY THE PROBLEM THIS YEAR FOR THE COMING FISCAL YEAR IS THAT THE TIME LINES FOR EMERGENCY CARE GIVER FUNDING ARE BEING REDUCED. TO NINETY DAYS RIGHT NOW IT'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS AND THERE'S GOOD CAUSE TO EXTEND TO THREE SIXTY FIVE WHEN THEY CAN SHOW THAT THE DELAY -- IS IS YOU KNOW NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BEING BECAUSE BY THE FAMILY -- NEXT YEAR IT'S GOING TO GO TO NINETY WITH NO GOOD CAUSE TO EXTEND AND THAT'S JUST GOING TO RE CREATE A CRISIS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED. I APPRECIATE THE LA THOSE COMMENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION EARLIER. OUR REQUEST IS THAT EMERGENCY CARE GIVER FUNDING TIME LINES BE EXTENDED IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS BUT EVEN MORE CRITICALLY GOOD CAUSE MUST BE BUILT INTO THIS PROGRAM SO THAT IT'S NOT THE FAMILIES THAT ARE THE ONE SUFFERING WHEN THE COUNTIES. ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE TIME LINES -- SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THIS PROPOSAL. THANKS VERY MUCH ANY COMMENTS FROM SOCIAL SERVICES. I CAN WE HAVE A POSITION ON THIS ONE HAPPY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS ABOUT -- ABOUT THIS IF IT'S OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY OKAY THANK YOU -- ALEJO. FINANCE HI THIRTY THREE MUCH HELP ON THE NEXT ONE TO EUROPE IN THE NEXT ONE GOOD ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOL OF ORIGIN TIME OF PLACEMENT. RIGHT AMY WHAT SO I'LL BE BRIEF ON THIS AS WELL BECAUSE I AM A YOUNG PERSON JOINING ME. TO SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE -- BUT ESSENTIALLY I APPRECIATE THE EARLIER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SCHOOL STABILITY AS WELL ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RIGHTS THAT A YOUNG PERSON IN FOSTERCARE HAS IS THE RIGHT TO STAY IN THEIR SCHOOL ORIGIN AND TO EFFECTUATE THAT RIGHT THERE IS FUNDING. TO ALLOW A CARE GIVER TO TRANSPORT THE CHILD TO THE SCHOOL OF ORIGIN THAT FUNDING DOESN'T START UNTIL THE FAMILIES FLLY APPROVED TO BECAUSE OF THE DELAYS AND RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL WHAT THAT MEANS IS. IF THEY DON'T GET THE FUNDING AND TELL THEIR PROVED THEY CAN GO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED DAYS WITHOUT ACCESS TO THAT FUNDING THAT'S THE MAJORITY OF A SCHOOL YEAR. AND SO THAT THREATENS THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY KEEP THAT SCHOOL STABILITY IN PLACE AND I AM IMPORTANCE HERE TO REALLY SPEAK TO THE PROPOSAL IN MORE DETAIL. THANK YOU. HI EMILY WATSON -- I'M WITH CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTIONS SACRAMENTO -- CHAPTER I'VE BEEN PROSECUTORS SIXTEEN I'M STILL FOSTER CARE. AND I MOVE LIKE THREE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS I ONLY KNOW WHAT HIGH SCHOOL I GRADUATED FROM -- BEFORE ENTERING CARE MY WHICH WILL SCHOOL WAS KIND OF LIKE A HOME A SAFE PLACE WHERE I CAN GET AWAY FROM ALL THE BAD THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING INSIDE MY HOUSEHOLDS. AND EDUCATIONAL STABILITY IS IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE IT GIVES FAST YOU THINK ME A CHANCE TO BE A KID. A STUDENT AND ALSO HOPE. I WAS UNABLE TO STAY IN MY SCHOOL OF ORIGIN BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED TOO FAR OR IN THE BEST INTERESTS WHICH IS JUST SACRAMENTO TO ELK GROVE. AND SO I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING PUNISHED AND STEPPED AWAY FROM. MY HOME MY FRIENDS MY SIBLINGS AND ALSO MY EDUCATION BECAUSE OF SOMETHING I HAD NO CONTROL OVER. AND WE REQUEST.

CHRIS COOKED PHONE FINANCE. OKAY THANK YOU SO -- ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS OUR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH OVERVIEW. SOURCES AND LIKE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ALREADY SO I'M NOT SURE. BUT I'LL BE SUPER BRIEF THOUGH JUST AT THE BASICALLY I THINK THE MAIN HIGHLIGHTS WITH THE LIKE THE THE WHAT YOU SEE IS THE BIGGEST. CHALLENGE IS A COLLEGE DEGREE FOR THE COMING YEAR -- BUDGETARY EARLY SO. SURE YEAH SO IT JUST AS A TABLE SETTING THE THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE HAVE ARE BOTH MEDI CAL IN ON MEDI CAL. OVERALL THE BUDGET IS ABOUT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND EIGHT AND A HALF BILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR I SAID KERN YOUR FRUSTRATION I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER NOT. WELL TAX -- ABOUT TWO BILLION IS MENTAL. ME TO SAY WHICH I KNOW WILL BE TALKING ABOUT LEADER AND THEN -- AND THREE BILLION TO ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDS AND THE REST IS A MIX OF COUNTY AND STATE GENERAL FUNDS -- OBVIOUSLY A YEAR WHERE THAT WE CONTRACT WITH A FIFTY SIX COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDER SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- THIS YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE HAD -- THE NEW NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE -- WE ARE WE WILL BE ANNOUNCING -- TOMORROW SANCTIONS ON SOMEHOW SOME COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THAT HAVE NOT -- COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS WITH RESPECT TO HAVING THE CORRECT NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WILL CERTAINLY MAKE SURE. THAT -- YOUR STAFF AND AND THE COMMITTEE GET THAT INFORMATION AS WELL -- OUTSIDE ESPECIALLY MALLHEALTH OBVIOUSLY WE DO ALSO PROVIDE MILD TO MODERATE A SERVICES THROUGH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS IN OUR FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM -- OUTSIDE OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM WE DO ADMINISTER FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT TO OUR STATE FUNDED SO IMAGES SAY AS WE TALK AS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LEADER. AS WELL AS NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT THAT THAT ALSO SERVES INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND THEN THERE ARE TWO FEDERAL. GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER THAT COUNTIES RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH BLOCK GRANT WHICH IS ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION AND THE PATHWAYS FOR TRANSITIONING FROM HOMELESSNESS -- WHICH IS ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OKAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM ALEJO FINANCE. ALL RIGHT -- SO ACTUALLY I DID I DID HAVE BELIEVE AND I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS [inaudible] THE AGENDA. NO SO AND THEN TO TRICK ME -- NO I MY POOR STAFF THEY USUALLY COME WITH QUESTIONS LATER ON THEY ALWAYS ANTICIPATE ALL OF THEM -- SO. IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY IN IN IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE -- IN THE CAR YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT WE TALKED ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF A JUSTICE FIRST JUST BECAUSE THAT WAS THE FIRST NIGHT ONE REALIGNMENT ITEM THAT CAME UP BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND IS. YEAH AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE DELVING MORE INTIMATE AND MAKES AS A BUT THIS IS REALLY PROBABLY THE ONLY PLACE WHERE WE HAVE AFTER YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MAYBE ABOUT. OUR ABOUT THE PART COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH -- AND SAID WE PLANS AND WEEDS ARE EXPLORED THAT YOU MADE MENTION OF THE FACT THAT SO CAN YOU SPEAK A LOT MORE AND YOU MADE REFERENCE TO OVERSIGHT RATE AND LAST YEAR I THINK THE CMS SAID YOU KNOW YOU NEED. TO DO MORE OVERSIGHT -- ALTHOUGH I SAY SOME OF THAT'S PERHAPS MORE TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT. IN MANY WAYS STRAIGHT AND CERTAINLY IT NETWORK ADEQUACY IS IS AN ISSUE. BUT BUT I GUESS I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON YEAH AND AND I KNOW I BROUGHT THIS UP AT THE PREVIOUS THING. SO FIVE AND I WASN'T AROUND FOR NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT SO WHAT MY BUDGET CHAIR TALI MITCHELL WOULD SAY THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS A STAFFERS AND SHE SHE SHE REMEMBERS THE PAIN OF THAT I I WASN'T AROUND FOR THAT BUT BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT. IN THE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT WELL CERTAINLY SOME OF IT WAS ABOUT HOW MONEY FLOWS THROUGH A CERTAIN ALSO REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF LEVEL LIKE LEVELS OF SERVICE OR SOME SORT OF THIS IS THAT. CORRECT ME YEAH YOU DEMI ISN'T JUST LIKE OKAY YOU ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FRESH CERTAIN YOU KNOW. LEVEL SERVICE CORRECT YES OKAY SO SO TO WHAT DEGREE I MEAN IT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE AFTER ALL MENTAL HEALTH THE MAN DOESN'T ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH YOUR VISA LASSEN CELL STACKS -- SO WHAT. TO WHAT DEGREE DOES. DTS BECAUSE NOW MENTAL HEALTH PART OF YOUR DEPARTMENT -- MONITOR IT OVERSEAS THAT ASPECT OF OF OF BE SURE THAT COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY MEETING THEIR REQUIREMENTS BEYOND JUST -- THIS IS HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'VE GOTTEN THIS AT CETERA TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE THE THE BUT YOU'RE WHAT THE OBLIGATION WAS BACK IN NINETY ONE AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MATTER YOU ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THAT LEVEL OF EFFORT. YEAH SO FOR SURE AND I CAN SPEAK TO THE MEDI CAL PIECES -- I DON'T KNOW THEM BUT NOT MEDI CAL IS MY OKAY I KNOW I'M A DOUBLE THE ADVENT OF THE TO GO ON THE MEDI CAL. YEAH I JUST ASK YOU REALLY THE MEDICAL THAT. NO THIS IS REALLY TO THE MEDICAL SERVE TERMS OF DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN YOUR ROLE OVERSEEING THE MEDIC ABSOLUTELY STILL. WE HAVE A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT WE DO OVERSIGHT SO ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS AS WE DO I TRY ANNUAL AUDITS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN SO SIMILAR TO HOW WE DO ANNUAL AUDITS. OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS WE DO OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERY YEAR IT'S EVERY THREE YEARS OF OUR OF OUR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND THAT LOOKS AT SORT OF ACROSS THE BOARD AT THE UTILIZATION THAT'S HAPPENING THE FUNDING THAT'S BEING SPENT. OUR CLAIMS COMING IN APPROPRIATELY ARE IS THE CORRECT DOCUMENTATION HAPPENING -- ALL OF ALL OF THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD BE DOING SORT OF IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT OF OF THE HEALTH PLAN WE DO THAT -- EVERY THREE YEARS WE ALSO HAVE OUR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATIONS SIMILAR AGAIN TO OUR MANAGED CARE -- STE SIDE -- TO MEDICAL MISTER SIDES THAT GOES OUT AND DOES THINGS ABOUT TIMELY ACCESS AND IS NOW ADDING THE NETWORK ADEQUACY COMPONENTS -- AND LOOKING AT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AND ON TOP OF THAT WE JUST SORT OF DO OUR NORMAL YOU KNOW LIKE. BRENDA AND HER TEAM WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES TO TRY TO PROVIDE AS MUCH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND IDENTIFY WHEN THINGS ARE ARE GOING WRONG I WOULD SAY -- I THINK AS THE AS THE PROGRAM HAS MOVED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I THINK WE DO HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN. IT WAS HOW IT WAS MANAGED PREVIOUSLY -- SO I DO THINK IT'S BEEN A CHANGE IN RELATIONSHIP IN A CHANGE IN PROCESS AND FOR STAFF. TO TO SORT OF SWITCH TO MORE MORE MORE OF AN OVERSIGHT AND REGULATOR ROLE SIR TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE LIKE WHAT WE DO ON THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE SIDE SO. I THINK WE'RE STILL GETTING THEIR THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED -- WITH RESPECT TO ANY ASPECT OF OF THE CONTRACT AND SO I THINK THAT WE ARE STILL. BUILDING THAT AT DECISIONAL CAPACITY AND SORT OF MAKING SURE THAT BOTH OF US. BRENDA AND HER TEAM AS WELL AS THE COUNTIES AND SEE EACH DAY ARE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO REALLY. MAKE SURE COMPLIANCE IS HAPPENING THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE OWED -- AND THAT THAT'S HAPPENING VERY CLEARLY AND SO A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE FACE. IS WHEN THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE OR IS IT A HEALTH PLAN SERVICE. SO WE'VE HAD THAT COME UP IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH. PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION FOR EATING DISORDERS. AND SO WE'VE YOU KNOW WE WORK TO IDENTIFY IDENTIFY AS MUCH CLEAR POLICY THROUGH INFORMATION NOTICES MALL PLAN LETTERS BUT THEN WE DO SERVE -- IN SOME CASES AS SORT OF A DISPUTE RESOLUTION TO HELP BOTH PLANNED UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR OBLIGATIONS ARE -- AND TYPICALLY IN THOSE CASES IT'S ABOUT A FIFTY FIFTY SPLIT SO WE DO SORT OF HAVE THAT AD HOC STUFF THAT WE DEAL WITH WHEN WHEN ISSUES COME UP. NEWS SO I GUESS WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT. AREAS THAT THERE ISN'T I GUESS A LOT OF PLAN REGULATION OF MONITORING STUFF BUT EXISTING EXISTING YEAH IT BUT I GUESS WE'LL IN EIGHT THE POSE THIS QUESTION I THINK THE DIRECTOR CAN WHEN THE HEARINGS -- IS THAT DO YOU KNOW THAT IS SO CLOSE THIS RIGHT YEAH. FOR THE POPULATION RIGHT I MEAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEMAND ARE NEEDED IS IN THE POP AND AT LEAST A MEDI CAL QUALIFYING POPULATION AND MEDI CAL POPULATION -- WE ACTUALLY MEETING THAT GREAT AND AND SO SO YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WHEN PEOPLE SEEK SERVICES AND THAT AND SO FORTH BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE. THERE MAY NOT BE SEEKING THEM ARE THEY'RE GETTING LOST IN THE PROCESS AND SO FORTH SO ARE WE DOING SOMETHING MORE PROACTIVE. TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE OUR MENTAL HEALTH GOALS -- AND AND SO I THINK THE OTHER PART OF IT IS A SITE FROM YOU KNOW DID YOU GET YOUR PAPERWORK ON TIME AND DID SO AND WHEN THEY SAID THEY NEED HELP GET THIS. GET SOMEONE ON TIME ET CETERA. THANK YOU ABOUT AND YOU KNOW WE THOUGH THAT'S ON THE OUTSIDE TO THE MORE PRACTICE -- QUALITY MEASURES TO LOOK AT HOW THE POPULATION IS DOING OVERALL AND THINKING ABOUT I THINK ONE OF% THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT. IS IS THAT. YOU KNOW SHOULD WE HAVE A GREAT RECOGNIZING EACH COUNTY CERTAINLY HAS THEIR OWN PRIORITIES SHOULD WE BE HAVING MORE STATE. WIDE MENTAL HEALTH GOALS RAIDERS CERTAINLY AND OUT. OF MY COLLEAGUES I GO WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT X. OR Y. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YET. I CAN LOOK AT THEM I SAID WELL GO TALK TO YOUR PART. OF THE POOR TO SUPERVISOR TALKED HIM OUT BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY IS THERE SOME WAY -- TO TO TO TO REQUIRE PEOPLE REPORT MEASURES ON ON ON AND NOT A HEALTH OUTCOMES -- THAT HAVE BEEN BIPARTISAN DEFY BY STATE NOW WHETHER THEY CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON THAT NOT THAT'S UP TO THEM BUT AT LEAST WE EVEN HAVE SOME DATA BACK SO WE CAN REPORT BACK TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. HOW WE'RE DOING ON THESE MENTAL HEALTH MANAGERS SO WE ARE PLANNING ON STARTING TO TRACK THE HEAT IS MEASURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I WILL SAY THERE'S NOT AS MANY? BUT THE IDEA IS I MEAN I REALLY SEE THIS IS THE STANDARDS AGAIN THAT'S A HEALTH PLAN APPROACH BUT I'M LIKE BUT EVEN DOING IT ON THAT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS APPLYING THE HEATING MEASURES TO COUNTY MIDDLE HEALTH NO BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE MANAGED CARE PLANS WE JUST. RIGHT HAVEN'T TRADITIONALLY OKAY WELL -- MY SISTER TAKING A MORE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH SAYING LIKE OKAY YOU KNOW. WE MIGHT HAVE BILL GOALS FOR THE POPULATION RIGHT AFTER ALL THE WHILE THEY'RE PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SIR IS THAT -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES YEAH DELIVERING SERVICES THEY ALSO ARE PART OF A AND MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION CONJUNCTION WITH IT'S JUST NOT MEDICAL LOAN BUT BASICALLY THINKING ABOUT. THE STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH GOALS AT THE YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY WE YOU'RE DEALING WITH. WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE IS NOT A HEALTH NEEDS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS SUBSTANCE USE RIGHT OPIOIDS BIG THING -- PEOPLE OR A CAR SERRATED WHEN -- THAT WONDER RELEASED -- SO NOW THEY GET SERVICES BUT MINE NOW THAT HER SENT OUT THE DOOR DAY AFTER WE HAD A GREAT SOCIETY. THINGS LIKE THAT I MEAN SETTING SOME GOALS ABOUT AND THAT AND PART OF IT IS TWELVE NOW THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH THE PRISON SYSTEM THEY NEED TO GET IT THROUGH THE MEDIC OUT PROGRAM NOW RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY SO ACTUALLY YOUR TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MAKE ME VERY EXCITED BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS IS THE WORK OF THAT WERE REALLY LOOKING TO BUILD ON WHEN WE HAVE THE RENEWAL OF OUR WAIVERS BOTH ARE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE AND ARE A LIVING FIFTEEN NEXT YEAR SO WE HAD. STARTED THIS WORK LAST YEAR WITH A VERY EARLY LOOK I THINK. I MAY HAVE TESTIFIED AT SOME POINT TO THIS WE HAD A LIKE A ABOUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE. AND SO I TALK ABOUT IT AND MY TEAMMATES I WOULD TALK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET ANNOYED BUT THEY THINK THAT. THEY'RE TRYING TO COME OVER LAST LIKE THE I REALLY TALK ABOUT IT AS LIKE A FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS LIKE REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE WANT THE PROGRAM TO LOOK AND THAT SPECIFICALLY ALSO HAS A GOAL OF AROUND INTEGRATION AND MAKING SURE THAT. PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO ALL THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND NOT JUST THE HEALTH SERVICES I MEAN I THINK -- YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING A LOT OF STUFF WITH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE TO TRY TO REALLY GET THE OTHER SORT OF SOCIAL. NEEDS BEING MET AS WELL BUT SPECIFICALLY WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE HOW DO WE MAKE IT A MUCH EASIER SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE I MEAN I SO I TALK ABOUT RATE I DON'T KNOW. PEOPLE MAY HAVE TO ACCESS SERVICES IN FIVE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THAT'S THAT'S NOT HOW WE WOULD HAVE BUILT IT TODAY IF IT WAS BEING BUILT TODAY SO WHAT SHOULD IT LOOK LIKE IT THIS IS WHERE. IT COMES TO THE FIVE AND TEN AND FIFTEEN BECAUSE MAYBE SOMETHING'S WILL TAKE LONGER BUT BUT WHAT SHOULD IT LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO WE GET THERE SORT OF TRYING. TO TRYING TO MANEUVER AROUND THE VERY VALID REASONS THE STRUCTURE EXIST THE WAY IT DOES TODAY FROM FINANCING REASONS TO DELIVERY SYSTEM REASONS. BUT IF WE WANTED TO CHANGE IT WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE AND THEN IS THERE A PATHWAY TO GET THERE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM FOR THE BENEFICIARY. AND THAT INVOLVES TRACKING ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF HAVING THESE BROADER GOALS OF OVERALL HEALTH. NOT JUST OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH OR DENTAL HEALTH OR MENTAL HEALTH BUT REALLY WHAT'S THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY WHAT'S THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND SO. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT I THINK WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING IDEAS THAT WILL BE EXCITED TO BE CHATTING MORE ABOUT IT WILL BE HAVING -- ANOTHER PUBLIC PROCESS IN THE FALL TO KICK OFF THE WAIVER RENEWAL STUFF AND SO THAT'S I'M IS THE THING I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT THESE DAYS THOUGH. OKAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO EVERYONE COME TO MY OFFICE BRAINSTORM. I'M ALWAYS WELCOME. WELL I DID WANT TO JUST TOUCH ON THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF THE AGENDA IS ABOUT THE ONLY PLACE WE CAN TOUCH ON THAT -- OKAY SO -- ALL RIGHT WELL WITH THAT -- LOOKING FORWARD TO THE AND LOOKING AT HOW WE YOU KNOW HOW WE MAKE OUR MEDI CAL OR MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WHEN WE CAN GET MORE INTO. SOME OF THE OTHER PIECES BUT I MAKE IT WORK BETTER FOR US SO ALL RIGHT -- LET'S THEN MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO AND USUAL OCCURRENCES COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS AND DISASTER RESPONSE. BRENDA GREATEST DCS -- SO WERE SEEKING -- TEN POSITIONS TO SUPPORT -- AND IT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF UNUSUAL OCCURRENCES THAT WE'VE -- HAD IN OUR FACILITIES -- MANY OF THE THIS INCREASE HAS BEEN DUE. TO OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FACILITY LICENSURE CATEGORIES NEW FACILITIES UNCERTIFIED PROGRAMS -- AND TO INTERVIEW INCREASED INTERACTION WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE ALSO HAVE -- A MORE -- MORE OF A HIGH NEEDS POPULATIONS THAT WERE SERVING AND OUR FACILITIES -- SO ARE WE HAVE A AND A INCREASE IN PEOPLE WITH -- BOTH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND I'M JUST THE A CUTIE IN GENERAL HAS INCREASED SO -- WE'RE SEEKING POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THAT WORKLOAD AS WELL AS YOU KNOW WITH THE INCREASE OF DISASTERS THAT WE'VE HAD FOR OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- PARTICULARLY WITH THE WITH REGARD TO THE WILD FIRES -- WE ARE ABLE TO RECALL -- I GET GRANT FUNDS FROM THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SO I THIS WOULD BE STE BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AND CONTINUE SUPPORTING THAT WORKLOAD ON FOR THE GRANTS. THANK YOU COMES FROM OHIO FINANCE. OKAY WELL THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE BE SURE YOU ACTUALLY YALA'S ASTOR KNOWING YOU HAVE THE ON GOING PATIENTS -- PEOPLE NEED HEALTHY PROBABLY AT NEW ONES. YES. ALL RIGHT WE NEED TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY OKAY -- LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE DRUG MEDI CAL ESTIMATES. SURE SO AMERICANS CAN -- SO THE DRUG MEDICAL PROGRAM BUDGET WHICH INCLUDES THE ODS WAIVER WHICH I KNOW IS THE NEXT ITEM IS ESTIMATED AROUND -- FIVE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND SIX HUNDRED NINETY MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THE BOOK OF THAT FUNDING IS COMING FROM FEDERAL FUNDS SIMILAR TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE -- WITH THE REMAINDER BEING COUNTY FUNDS AND SOME STATE GENERAL FUNDS -- AS WAS LAID OUT IN THE AGENDA THERE'S REALLY FOUR MAIN MODALITIES IN OUR DRUG MEDIC HELP PROGRAM THE NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAM OUTPATIENT DRUG FREE. INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT AND RESIDENTIAL ONE OF THE THINGS TO NOTE FROM A BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE IS WE HAVE REVISED THE METHODOLOGY FOR DOING THE DRUG MEDI CAL ESTIMATE -- STARTING IN THE NOVEMBER ESTIMATE THAT YOU ALL HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU -- IT'S REALLY TO MAKE IT MORE SIMILAR TO HOW WE DO THE REST THE ESTIMATE AND ACTUALLY HOW MONEY ACTUALLY FLOWS. THE BIGGEST CHANGE IS REALLY AS HOW WE MEASURE CASELOAD SO -- WHEN WE GOT WHEN THE PROGRAM CAME OVER THEY IT WAS WAY THAT IT USED TO BE DONE AND THAT WE HAD DONE IT UNTIL WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE THIS CHANGE WAS TO DO YOU? UNDO BUT HE DID ANNUAL USERS -- EVERY OTHER PLACE WHERE WE DO -- CASELOAD WE DO AVERAGE MONTHLY ELIGIBLES AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE THAT CHANGE SO. TRYING TO COMPETE DO COMPARISONS BETWEEN SORT OF APPROPRIATIONS STUFF AND AND THIS ESTIMATE IS CHALLENGING BUT FROM NOW ON YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE COMPARISONS AND UNDERSTAND SO NOTHING FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED IN THE PROGRAM IT JUST THE METHODOLOGY CHANGED. AND SO YOU'LL DEFINITELY SEE SOME SOME DIFFERENCES FROM FROM A PREPARATION BUDGET -- THE OTHER THING I NOTE FROM -- BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE AS WE DO CONTINUE TO SEE A SHIFT OF FUNDING OUT OF SORT OF THE DRUG MEDI CAL BE SENT INTO THE ODS WEAVER. AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE COUNTIES -- GO INTO THAT WEAVER SO JUST JUST FLOODING THAT FOR YOU -- THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS AGAIN I SORT OF SIMILAR TO WHAT I SAID ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE. REALLY TRYING TO INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE IN OVERSIGHT EFFORTS ON THAT COUNTY SYSTEMS NOT JUST AN ODS WHICH ARE MORE LIKE -- THE IMAGE BEES IN TERMS OF BEING ORGANIZED EVERY SYSTEMS BUT ALSO IN THE STATE PLAN. SERVICES SO WE DID UNDERTAKE -- SOME ACTIONS LAST YEAR RELATED TO AN AUDIT WHERE -- FORTY FIVE OF THE COUNTIES WERE FOUND TO BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH A THAT THE PROVIDING STATE PLAN SERVICES. WE DID HAVE -- ESSENTIALLY CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE WITH THEM IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS OF TODAY IT THEY ALL HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THEY ALL DO FINALLY HAVE DRUG MEDI CAL CONTRACTS WHICH THAT. THERE WAS THE CASE WHERE THERE WERE SOME COUNTIES THAT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE CONTRACTS. AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET. CONTRACTS WITH PROVIDERS AND ARE PROVIDING SERVICES WE DID HAVE SOME COUNTIES WHERE THERE WERE ZERO CLAIMING FOR DRUG MEDI CAL -- REALLY THEY ARE USING THEIR THEIR BLOCK GRANT TO TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO BUT WE WORK. BUT WE DO SO WE WEREN'T SEEING MEDI CAL SERVICES EVEN THOUGH IT WAS LIKELY MEDI CAL PEOPLE -- SO WE'RE WORKING ALSO THE ON REPORTING AND DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT THE BLOCK GRANT THAT I KNOW WE HAVE A B. C. PIER RELATED TO THAT WILL TALK ABOUT LATER. SO -- DO WE JUST GO INTO THE WORKPLACE LIVER SYSTEM. TO OKAY WELL WE WHILE WE WAIT TELL THEM ANY COMES FROM ILIO FINANCE. JUST ACTUALLY JUST A CURIOSITY -- RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT SERVICES CASELOAD. TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT THIS IS WHAT IT IS. IT JUST ALL OF THE NUMBERS LOOKS PRETTY SMALL AS SMALL SO HE'S LIKE WANTING LIKE IT'S IS THIS A VESTIGE OF SOMETHING OR IS THIS A OUR DAILY GIVEN THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NUMBER PEOPLE ON MEDICARE PROGRAM. I JUST LOOKED LIKE OUR HEAVENLY OF THIS THREE OF OUTSIDE OF THE ODS WAIVER. RESIDENTIAL WAS A VERY LIMITED BENEFIT IN TERMS OF MEDI CAL BENEFITS SO IT WAS USE AND PERI NATAL. BECAUSE OF IT BECAUSE OF THAT I AM THE RESTRICTIONS -- YOU KNOW SO MOST OF THE STUFF WASN'T IS NOT A STATE PLAN SERVICE TO RESIDENTIAL STATE PLAN SERVICES PRETTY SMALL IT'S REALLY. IN THE ODS WAVERED WORD WE'RE STARTING TO SEE MUCH MORE RESIDENTIAL SERVICES OKAY SOUNDS CURES LIKE WHO THESE PEOPLE WORD AND ENDED UP IN THIS PROGRAM YEAH ALL TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM. PEOPLE ARE KIDS. BASICALLY OKAY AND ALL RIGHT A SMALL NUMBER THEM NOT NOT LIKE THE BRIGHT ELATION WHERE IN IT THOUGH COLUMN EXISTS LARGER QUE ALL RIGHT JUST WONDER LIKE OKAY THAT. IS YOU SEE SMALL NUMBERS LIKE OKAY THAT BECAUSE SOME PLACE IN THE AND SO YOU'RE ALSO SEEING BECAUSE SOME OF THE LARGEST COUNTIES HAVE MOVED INTO THE ODS WAIVER. OKAY THE STATE PLAN NUMBER IS GOING TO BE SMALL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY SMALL COUNTY IS THAT RIGHT SO TODAY'S ECKLEY THESE ARE THE REMAINING COUNTIES WITH THIS ARE OKAY IN THAT DOWN AND IT'S A SMALL BENEFIT YOU SMALL BENEFIT OKAY ALL RIGHT. NO IT'S I DO LOOK AT THE STABLES. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER FOUR THAN THIS ALRIGHT THOUGH DS WAIVER OR SO REALLY JUST CONTINUING ON FROM A LOT BECAUSE I THE TOTAL BUDGET NUMBER WAS INCLUSIVE ODS.

AS A PRODUCT UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT IS OFFERED DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES OFFERED UP TO REASONS WHY -- ANCILLARY SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF ARE NOT YET IN PLACE FIRST OF ALL THE DEPARTMENT HAS CONTENDED THAT IT LACKS SPECIFIC DIRECTION. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ADOPTING REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND THE ASSOCIATED CODES FOR ANCILLARY SERVICES SUCH AS PHYSICIAN INJECTION FEE -- PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT AND EVEN YOUR ANALYSIS SO WE HAVE PROPOSED TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND TO ITS COUNTERPART IN THE ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE. EARLIER IN JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT PUBLISHED A MEMO TO THE FIELD INDICATING THAT THE ENABLING LEGISLATION. TO PROVIDE EXPANDED MATT AVAILABILITY IN OUR KIND OF TREATMENT PROGRAMS DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY FINANCING WHICH WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE LEGISLATION WAS NEVER ANALYZES HAVING. COST.

BUT THAT BUT WE NEED TO GIVE SOME TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DRESS. TO DO VOICE THAT FOR STATE RIGHT NOW AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST FOCUSING ON TEACHER FOR FOCUSING ON THE STATE COMMUNITY RIGHT SO IT'S DENTURES IT'S THE BUS DRIVER IT UP -- THE HALL MONITOR BOOKS THAT ARE COMING INTO CONTACT -- WITH STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE REALLY WANT THIS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY APPROACH OKAY EXCELLENT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR MUCH [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. EXCEPT BURKE COUNTY SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLANS THE STEINBERG ASTUTE WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON ADRIN SOLD SOME OF THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE AND WE ARE PROUD TO BRING THIS PROPOSAL FOR TODAY WHICH IS ABOUT PREVENTING SUICIDES IN OUR STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO REDUCE THIS ALARMING INCREASE IN SUICIDES. RECENT DATA FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR -- FOUND THAT SUICIDES IN THE U. S. ROSE 33% FROM. NINETEEN NINETY NINE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN NEARLY FORTY THREE HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS DIE BY SUICIDE UNTIL AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH IS A 50% INCREASE FROM. TWO THOUSAND ONE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST FIGURES FROM THE US CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND FOR PEOPLE UNDER. THIRTY FIVE SUICIDE IS THE SECOND LEASING LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AFTER ACCIDENTS. ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE SUICIDE RATE AMONG CHILDREN AGES. TEN TO FOURTEEN JUMPED AN ASTONISHING 210025% BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND ONE OTHER STATISTIC THAT GOT MY ATTENTION ABOUT WHO IS IMPACTED BY SUICIDE. AND CALIFORNIA'S THAT ACCORDING TO A STATE STUDY JUST OVER HALF OR 51%. OF THE RESPONDENTS SAID THAT THEY HAD A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH SUICIDE SO THIS IS NOW THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. SO WE ARE PROPOSING THAT ALL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE A SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN. A COUNTY SUICIDE PREVENTION TASK FORCE AND WRITING A SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN CAN HELP IN IDENTIFYING GAPS OR MISSING ACTIONS AND BETTER PROMOTE AND COMMUNICATE ABOUT SUICIDE PREVENTION. ACTIONS COUNTIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANS HAVE REPORTED THAT THE PLANS HAVE HELPED THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND SUICIDE IN THEIR COUNTIES. TO HELP GUIDE COUNTY EFFORTS AGAIN IF I GOALS AND BE ABLE TO MEASURE PROGRESS IN FACT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERTED SUICIDE PREVENTION. EFFORTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN THEY HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN SUICIDE DEATHS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUICIDE DUSTER CREASE BY 11% AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE IN OUR STATE. BUT THIS WILL REQUIRE A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BROUGHT FOR THIS PROPOSAL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU INCOMES MARKET SERVICES L. L.. FINANCE OKAY. RIGHT NOT THE THEY KNOW THAT THERE WAS A A BILL ADDRESSING THIS THAT WE'VE HEARD AND HEALTH COMMITTEE AS WELL AND AS YOU POINTED OUT THAT -- IT'S NO ONE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH OF OUR YOUTH COURSES I'D ANY AGE AS IS TERRIBLE -- BT WE WE WE HAD -- THE THE RISING RATES OF SUICIDE CERTAINLY EXTRA AND WHAT CONCERNS UNDERSTATEMENT CELL AND AND THAT WE WE NEED TO HAVE. STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THAT SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD OKAY THANK YOU RIGHT.

OUR REQUEST IS FOR SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE RESOURCES BACK TO THE LEVEL IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IN DOING SO WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT. OUR EFFORTS FOCUSED ON FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE OR DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR TODAY MOST OF THE REQUEST. FOCUS ON REMEDIATION TO STOP THE BLEEDING ON MAJOR PROBLEMS. FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE IS MORE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH IT REALLY IS A VACCINE TO HELP PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM THE INFLUENCES THE COMMUNITY AND ENGAGING THEM. TO MAKE THEIR COMMUNITIES BETTER PLACES SO THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT DOWNSTREAM PROBLEMS WERE ADDRESSING BEFORE THEY BECOME BIGGER PROBLEMS. SO MAKING SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY GET INVOLVED WITH THEIR COMMUNITY. THAT THEY'RE GETTING SKILL BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT THEY HAVE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS IN THEIR AREAS. SO IT BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND SACRAMENTO IS OUR FIRST AREA AND RIVERSIDE IS OUR SECOND. AND IN FRESNO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FROM ROSE ABOUT WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND REALLY CHANGING THE COMMUNITY BY CHANGING BILLBOARDS AROUND THEIR SCHOOLS BY CHANGING THE ORDINANCES ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ALCOHOL.

ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NEXT IS THE CHILDREN'S CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL AND THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA LANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS CHRIS STONER MERTZ I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. THIS TRAILER BILL WILL REPLACE THE TERM CHILDREN'S CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM WITH CHILDREN'S CRISIS PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. FACILITY OR P. R. T. F.. MAKING THE TERM CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL MEDICAID DEFINITIONS AND THEREFORE ENSURING THAT IT IS TREATED CONSISTENTLY WITH OTHER PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES WITH REGARD TO LICENSING CERTIFICATION. AND PAYMENT THROUGH THE E. PST TEAM MEDI CAL BENEFITS. ARE YOU HEARD MICHELLE TENS DATA AROUND SUICIDE -- IN ADDITION. OF CALIFORNIA'S POOREST CHILDREN ONE IN TEN MEET THE CRITERIA FOR SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE. WE CERTAINLY HAVE A CRISIS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IT FOR KIDS -- PETER T. F.'S CAN PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR HOUR INTENSIVE TREATMENT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO HOSPITALIZATION AND ARE CRITICALLY NEEDED AS PART OF A CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR CHILDREN. UNDER TWENTY ONE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AB ONE FIVE OH ONE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIDLEY SCOTT IS THE BILL THAT CREATED A LICENSING CATEGORY FOR C. C. R. PEAS. IT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IT WAS INTENDED TO FILL A TRUE GAP IN CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR CHILDREN AND PROVE CARE. FOR THOSE CHILDREN EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF C. C. R. PEAS IS TO PROVIDE A SHORT TERM CRISIS STABILIZATION THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION. AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMMING AND THEN UNLOCK STAFF SECURED SETTING WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF SUPERVISION STRUCTURE. WITH THE GOAL OF SUPPORTING A RAPID AND SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF CHILDREN BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. THIS WAS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION INCLUDING YOUTH FAMILY MEMBERS PROVIDERS COUNTY ASSOCIATIONS AT CETERA. THE BILL LANGUAGE REPLICATED SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN MASSACHUSETTS CALLED COMMUNITY BASED ACUTE TREATMENT OR SEE BAT THE C. C. R. P. LIKE SEE BAT AND THE CHILDREN'S CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS AND ALL OTHER STATES THAT WE REVIEWED. ARE OPERATED UNDER THE FEDERAL DESIGNATION OF P. R. F. P. R. T. F.'S OR IF IT THAT IS MEDICAID PARLANCE IT'S THEIR DESIGNATION. TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND IN TWO THOUSAND ONE CMS ESTABLISHED P. R. T. F. AS A NEW CATEGORY OF MEDICAID FACILITY. AND AN ADDITIONAL SETTING FOR WHICH THE PSYCH UNDER TWENTY ONE BENEFIT COULD BE PROVIDED. THIS PROVIDED A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH CONTINUUM OF CARE. THAT ENSURES THAT THERE IS A MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT FOR A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF SERVICES. IN ONE RATE. DURING THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING AB FIVE OH ONE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER C. C. R. P. FACILITIES WERE GONNA FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY OF P. R. T. F. WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED. WE WERE LOOKING AT WHAT TYPE OF LICENSE CATEGORY WOULD WORK MOST EFFECTIVELY -- THE S. T. R. T. P. LICENSURE WAS THE MOST COMPATIBLE WITH THE C. C. R. P. MODEL. AND SO THIS IS THE LICENSE CATEGORY THAT WAS AGREED UPON. THIS IS CREATED CONFUSION. TO WRAP UP SENT UP. BECAUSE THE C. C. R. P. IS A NOT A FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT. IT IS CLEARLY A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL ALTERNATIVE. I'M GONNA JUMP TO THE KEY POINT. BECAUSE I KNOW I'M OVER MY TIME. THERE IS NO FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THAT EXISTS THAT STIPULATES WHICH STATE AGENCY MUST LICENSE THE PRC OFF. THE ISSUE AT HAND TODAY IS THE BILL IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE IT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CERTIFY THESE PROGRAMS AS PR T. F.'S THIS LANGUAGE. THAT WE WOULD WE'RE PROPOSING IN TRAILER BILL WOULD REQUIRE DH CS TO CERTIFY C. C. R. PEAS AS P. R. T. F.'S ENSURING FULL MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THIS TWENTY FOUR HOUR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. IS VERY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU AND COMMENTS FROM THE BAR HEALTH SERVICES ALPHABET SOUP SORRY LEO COMMONS. FINANCE ALL RIGHT. SO ACTUALLY I DID FOR PARK OF SERVICES I MEAN.

A RECENT SURVEY OF OUR MEMBERS REVEALED COUNTIES ARE SPENDING APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THESE PROGRAMS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF COUNTY FUNDING OUR MEMBERS ARE STRUGGLING TO MANAGE UNREASONABLE AND OVERWHELMING CASELOADS.

RESEARCH SHOWS THE TARGET POPULATION THAT WE SERVE HAS GROWN 30% IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THIS 30% INCREASE OF CASES IS DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE LAWS AND POLICIES. WHICH HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED REFERRALS AND INCREASE THE COMPLEXITY OF CASES SOME OF THESE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES INCLUDE THE OMNIBUS CONSERVATORSHIP ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE PLAYING FIELD. BY REMOVING THE P. T. PC'S DISCRETION THE FILE AND MAN IN MANDATED THAT THE P. GPC PUBLIC GARDENING CONSERVATORS FILE A PETITION OF CONSERVATORSHIP WHEN ANY COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED INDIVIDUAL IS AT RISK OR WHENEVER THE COURT. BELIEVES IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL.

THIRTEEN SEVENTY HAS BECAUSE HE HE EACH INCREASE IN REFERRALS FOR CRIMINAL OFFENDERS WHO ARE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IN DEEMED UNRESTORED COMPETENCY. THEIR PROMPTLY RETURNED TO THE COUNTY AND A CONSERVATORSHIP SOUGHT SOUGHT. AS THE LEGISLATURE DEBATES FURTHER REFORMS AND POLICIES TO DEAL WITH THE GROWING NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS SEVERELY COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED BECAUSE OF THE AGING POPULATION. AND SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL AND VICTIMS OF SEVERE. PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL ABUSE THE NEED FOR PHP TPC SERVICES ARE NEEDED MORE THAN EVER AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU'RE GOOD OKAY SHE'D LEFT USE. CASE. SHE ONLY LEFT ABOUT FIVE SECONDS ANYWAY SO LIKE OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- ANY COMES FOR HIS SERVICES ALEJO. FINANCE WHICH COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO I AM I GET I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD BEEN ANALYST FINANCE EARLIER MIGHT WANT TO ANSWER THIS ONE IS IS THAT -- IS MENTIONED THAT -- YOU KNOW. WE THROUGH THE STATE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR'S AYE IT THAT HAVE HAVE INCREASED THE WORKLOAD. A CONSERVATIVE OR I THOUGHT. IT IS YOURS GUARDIANS COULD SERVICE -- SO -- SO -- THAT DOESN'T ADD DAY DISSIDENT TRIGGER A STATE NEED TO PUT CHEN. TELL ANYTHING THE THOUGHTS ON THAT OUT OF THE HISTORY OF WHAT WHOSE WAS TO DO WHAT SO YES. YEAH I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY COMMENTS I WOULD I'D BE CURIOUS TO SEE THE DATA AND TO TO KNOW LIKE WHAT WORKLOAD WAS INCREASE BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING I THINK WHEN THERE ARE INCREASED COSTS THAT RESULT IN STATE MANDATES. YOU KNOW THEIR CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH THE ENTITY THAT COUNTY SAID. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE AND IF THEY'RE LEFT AND UNFUNDED THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW PROCESS THAT. COUNTIES CAN FILE STATE MANDATE CLAIMS. BUT I MEAN THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE HAD IN LIKE. YEAH OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I MEAN IT I MEAN WHEN ONE ROUTE WOULD BE TO GO TO MANDATE COMMISSION SAY BY THE WAY YOU KNOW IT'S AT BUT I THINK THE OTHER PRO YEAH YEAH I GUESS I GUESS RIGHT WE TRIED THAT WE WENT TO THE STATE MANDATE. COMMISSION AND AND AND MADE A CASE THEY DENIED IT BECAUSE THE LAW IT'S IT'S CONTRADICTORY SO THE LAW SAYS THAT THE COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC GUARDIAN. BUT AT THE COUNTY CHOOSES TO HAVE APUBLIC GUARDIAN THEN WE MANDATE THAT YOU DO ALL THESE THINGS BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT THAT SHIP SAILED A LONG TIME AGO LIKE FORTY YEARS AGO THE COUNTIES CREATED PUBLIC GUARDIANS. AND NOW PUBLIC GUARDING CONSERVATIVES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THESE CASES THE COURT IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW US TO WALK AWAY WE DON'T HAVE THAT DISCRETION AT THIS POINT TO WALK AWAY. SO WE WERE CAUGHT IN A IN A DOUBLE BIND. THE STATE MANDATES SAID I'M NOT IT'S NOT YOU PERSONALLY -- STATE MANDATE SAID NO YOU DON'T QUALIFY BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THIS. BUT WE DO HAVE TO HAVE IT BECAUSE OUR SOCIETY HAS GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE IT IS REQUIRED. SO WE WERE WE WERE NOT ELIGIBLE. DIMMING FOR TO COME RIGHT NOW IT WOULD JUST SAY THAT I I THINK. DEFINITELY WHEN THERE'S LAWS PASSED A LOT OF THE TIMES THEY THEY SAY THE COUNTIES MAY. RATHER THAN SHALL AND SO WHAT WITH IT MOST OF THE SELECTION OF THE COUNTY AND WHETHER NOT THEY WANT TO DO THAT OKAY WELL AS A LIST OF THE SITE. SO I MEAN WE CAN. WE CAN. WEEK AS I'M NOT A LAWYER SO WE COULD NOT TAKE THE LAW -- BUT I THINK SO SO MAYBE LEGALLY NOT MANDATED BUT I I I I DO WONDER ABOUT -- THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE SOME FUNDING. BECAUSE OF WHAT WORK WE'VE REQUIRED SO I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT STRICTLY YOU KNOW. THE MAN A COMMISSION VOTE CENTER OF ANY JUST PHILOSOPHICALLY RIGHT NOW EXACTLY WHILE MUCH IN THAT CENTRO THE WE CAN DEBATE ARGUE BUT I'M JUST SAYING CONCEPTUALLY. SOMETIMES ON A SAY WELL YOU DON'T THE COUNTIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT IT'S NOT. THE STATE YOU KNOW STATE BY VOTERS CREATING MORE WORK. PERHAPS WE OUGHT. TO FOR A IN IN AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS OKAY I HAVE TO SAY BUT IT SOUNDS AS IF THE STATE CURRENTLY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY DIRECT FUNDING FOR THAT RIGHT SO OKAY WELL I THINK I THINK SO ANYWAY. I'M STE. SURE YOU CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE THE WITH THE WITH THE FINANCE AND I DON'T AS EARLY OVERLOOKED AT THIS ISSUE ABOUT. RISING WORKLOAD. FOR THE MINISTERS GUARDIANS CONSERVATIVES. OUR STATE ACTIONS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN CHANGES IN THE ROLE. NO WE AND NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANALYZE THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM BUT WE'D STILL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE PROPONENTS -- TO GET SOME MORE ANSWERS TO THE LEGISLATURE HERE TO YOUR POINT SENATOR MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT PUBLIC CONSERVATISM PUBLIC GUARDIANS ARE WHAT THEY DO AND WELL THAT'S A THIS WAY. BUT YOU REALLY NEED ONE YOU LEARNED ALL TOO FAST RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU SORRY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON TO BE DOING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE MIDDLE SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION OKAY. UNDER BRITISH DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES [inaudible] HELLO. BRUNDTLAND IS ILLEGAL MARK NEWTON ALEJO AND IT'S ANON COMMENT FROM THE FINANCE. CRISCO TEHAMA FINANCE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO -- FIRST ISSUE IS JUST -- OVERS -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT OVERSIGHT AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT. AND I THE FOCUS ON THE HIGHLIGHTS HERE. ABSOLUTELY US THROUGH A PRETTY GREAT WISH ARE WE ARE SEEKING THIRTEEN POSITIONS -- WERE SEEKING TO RE DIRECT FUNDING% FROM AN EXISTING -- TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON ALLOCATION THAT WE HAVE TO RE DIRECTED -- THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF THE EMPHASIS ON STRENGTHENING OUR OVERSIGHT FOR THE MOBILE SERVICES ACT THROUGH -- AUDITS FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AS WELL AS LITTLE ARE HOOVER COMMISSION -- AND AS WELL AS SOME -- HEARINGS LAST YEAR AND SO WHILE WE'VE REALLY YOU ARE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AND DETERMINED THAT -- YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE -- A GOOD IDEA TO REDIRECT FUNDS FROM AT A TV CONTRACT WERE NOT EXPENDING ALL OF OUR FUNDS -- TO REALLY FOCUS IT INTO OUR STRENGTH AND OUR OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING SO ARE THE FOR THE POSITIONS WOULD BE USED TO STRENGTHEN OUR FISCAL OVERSIGHT -- AND OUR POLICY IN OUR PROGRAM OVERSIGHT. AND I THINK WE HAD SEVERAL QUESTIONS HERE. WE'RE GOING TO ANSWER THOSE ABSOLUTELY -- SO I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS -- HAD TO DO WITH -- DESCRIBING ACTIVITIES PERFORMED BY CA BHS AND BEARDED SHOWS IN A LONG STANDING CONTRACTOR WITH THE FORMER DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH AND CURRENT BERMAN HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- AND AND THEY REALLY HELP US WITH ARM -- UP PROVIDING TRY TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF EVALUATION DESIGN -- AS WELL AS ON E. LEARNING MODULES AND WEBINARS WE DO THINGS WITH THEM LIKE OUR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES SYMPOSIUM OUR MEDICAL DIRECTORS TRAINING FISCAL LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE THESE ARE ACTIVITIES THAT WE PLAN TO CONTINUE WITH OUR WITH WITH THREE ZERO VHS SUCH WERE RIGHT OUT SUPPORT TO THE COUNTIES -- AND COUNTIES YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OR SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GET DIRECT ALLOCATIONS NOW FOR OF MHSAA DOLLARS SO THEY'RE ABLE TO SPEND. THE DOLLARS THAT THEY RECEIVED -- TO ON TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT TAYLOR'S TO THEIR NEEDS SO SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WASN'T THAT WERE DONE THROUGH THE CA BEACH AS PRIME CONTRACTOR ONE TIME THAT CAN NOW BE DONE. THROUGH COUNTIES THEMSELVES ARE THINGS ON MY COMMUNITY TO FIND TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THEY CAN COUNTIES CAN STEP PRIORITIES ON ON THE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED TAYLOR TO THEIR NEEDS WANT ME TO RUN TO THE FISCAL REGULATIONS AS WELL -- SO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE HAVE RISE THAT PUT OUT FOR COMMENT ARE ARE FISCAL REGULATIONS -- THOSE ARE INCLUDE. THEY ARE DRESSED -- ALLOCATION AND EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING INTEREST PRUDENT RESERVE MAINTENANCE RECORDS REVERSION AN APPEALS -- IT TALKS ABOUT AMENDING THE REVENUE EXPENDITURE REPORTS TO COLLECT CURRENT DATA HAD TO ADDRESS CURRENT DATA NEEDS IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE WITH HOLDS THAT WE CAN DO ON AN HSA DISTRIBUTIONS IF -- ROBIN EXPENDITURE REPORTS ARE NOT REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND SO WE BELIEVE THESE -- MHSAA FISCAL ROEG'S WILL HALL -- STANDARDIZE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION ACROSS ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND THAT -- IT THE ALSO HELP US ON IN TERMS OF I AM SUPPORTING COUNTIES TO GET MORE COMPLETE AND ACCURATE DATA FOR TRACKING AND TRANSPARENCY. THANK YOU I THINK MISTER CHAIR SO WE'VE -- TO BE DOING ON BEHALF KNOW HOW SERVICES OVER SENATE COMMITTEE COMMISSION -- THE GENDER RAISES THE ISSUE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF RECONCILING NUMBERS AT THE COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY USING TO REPORT FISCAL TRANSPARENCY AND SO WE'VE PASSED OUT OF THE SCREEN SHOT -- ON OUR WEBSITE AT THE MOMENT THE COMMISSION HAS TAKEN REVENUE EXPENDITURE REPORTS AND CREATED A BASICALLY DIGITAL MAP OF THESE REPORTS. THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC AND POLICY MAKERS TO BASICALLY CLICK ON A COUNTY AND SEE HOW MUCH MONEY A COUNTY RECEIVED BY FISCAL YEAR BY IMAGES A COMPONENT. HOW MUCH MONEY IS SPENT BY COUNTY BY YOUR BY COMPONENT AND HOW MUCH MONEY IS LEFT AVAILABLE IN THE BANK? THIS IS PART OF A LARGER EFFORT THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO SEE THE DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED WITH THOSE DOLLARS AND THEN THE HARD PART IS THE OUTCOMES. THE INTENT OF THIS WORK IS TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS THAT IS REQUIRED IN THE MIDDLE HOW SERVICES ACT. THE IDEA IS THAT SOMEONE FROM THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK INTO THAT PROCESS AND HAVE THE BASICS IN BASIC INFORMATION AT THEIR FINGERTIPS TO REALLY ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND HOW WELL IT'S WORKING. WE THINK THIS WORK IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE -- THE STATE'S HISTORY IN THE COUNTY HISTORY IN TERMS OF REPORTING WAS NOT GREAT BUT AS WE RELEASE THESE THESE FIGURES AND CREATED PUBLIC AWARENESS IT IT CREATED ATTENTION ON THE PROBLEM AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE AND COUNTY SOME VERY RESPONSIVE. THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF AB ONE FOURTEEN AS THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEGUN TO GO BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR TO RECONCILE. RECEIPTS REVENUES SPENDING IN UNSPENT FUNDS THAN WHAT WE'RE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE NUMBERS THE DEPARTMENT HAS DON'T MATCH WITH THE NUMBERS THAT WE'VE BEEN RELYING ON WHICH OF THE COUNTY ARE YEAH OURS WHICH ARE CERTIFIED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR CONTROLLERS. SO WE ARE WE'VE RAISED THE ISSUE WITH THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVEN'T SAT DOWN YET BUT I THINK THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO SIT DOWN AND FIGURE THAT OUT. OUR CONCERN IS THAT. IT BY LINKING THIS DATA TO A THIRD PARTY CERTIFIED REPORT FROM THE COUNTIES WE HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE DAY THAT THE ORIGINAL DATA SOURCES GOOD. OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THE WAY IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT HAS. COUNTING EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES BY YEAR THAT THE NUMBERS DON'T MATCH. AND WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE CONFUSION ON THE PART OF FOR EXAMPLE -- COUNTY SUPERVISORS WHO ARE LOOKING AT THEIR OWN COUNTIES NUMBERS AND COMPARING THEM TO THE STATE'S NUMBERS AND THEY DON'T LINE UP AND SO SO WHAT WE'VE RAISED WITH SAFF AND WE DAM OUT. ALL OF THESE TOOLS WITH STAFF WITH YOUR STAFF. IS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN. AND DEVELOP A AN AGREED UPON UNIFORMS STRATEGY FOR COUNTY REPORTING AND STATE REPORTING SO WE HAVE A SINGLE SET OF NUMBERS THAT ARE VALID AND RELIABLE. THAT WORK HASN'T BEEN DONE YET BECAUSE THE THE FISCAL RAGS ARE NEW BECAUSE THE CHANGE AND IN THE ACCOUNTING APPROACH HAS JUST HAPPENED BUT IT BUT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN HIGHLIGHT THAT AS A CHALLENGE. IF THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND UPDATE THE FISCAL REPORTS IF WE WERE TO DO THAT NOW FOR EXAMPLE WITH COUNTY DRIVEN REPORTS WE WOULD SEE THAT IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY MATCH ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS WITH THE STATE'S NUMBERS. WE THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM. CERTAINLY CAN CAUSE A LOT OF CONFUSION. ABSOLUTELY UP COSTS DID YOU HAVE MORE TO SAY [inaudible] OKAY. EDWARD WE ARE COMMITTED TO SITTING DOWN WITH THE AC AND AND FIGURING THAT OUT BUT ARE YOURS ARE BASICALLY LIKE COSTS REPORTS AND SO WOW WHAT GETS SUBMITTED AND CERTIFIED CAN CHANGE AFTERWARDS BECAUSE COUNTIES MAKE UPDATE SO -- SO EVEN YOU KNOW THE METHODOLOGY IS LIKE -- YOU KNOW IN A DIRECTORY EWING SAID THAT -- METHODOLOGIES CAN CHANGE OVER TIME -- SO CAN THE NUMBERS THAT THE COUNTY IS -- SUBMIT BASED ON YOU KNOW JUST CALL CORRECTIONS OF INACCURACIES AND SUCH SO I THINK WE JUST NEED TO SIT DOWN AND KIND OF WORK IT OUT TOGETHER AND JUST MAKE SURE. THAT -- THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THAT SURE THE NUMBERS LINE UP SO WE HAVE SOME IDEAS FOR THAT AND WE'RE GONNA. WE'RE ALL WORKING HARD WORK IT OUT OKAY ALL RIGHT HELLO I WAS MILLION THE NO ALL RIGHT. FINANCE [inaudible] MEMBERS. OKAY SO I AM. YEAH I'M AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THINGS THAT THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NO ONE THE AUDITOR'S REPORT CAME OUT AS DURING SUBCOMMITTEE AND WE COULDN'T FIGURE I RECONCILE WE HEARD DTS NEVER BOTHER TRACKING THE NUMBERS SO -- BECAUSE AND THEY INITIATIVE IT SAYS THAT YOU DON'T SPEND THE MONEY IT COMES BACK. AS LIKEWELL WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TRACK WHATEVER I MEAN THAT THAT I THINK THAT WAS -- I THINK THAT LED TO A TREMENDOUS LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND AND SO -- AND AND I THINK IT WENT WELL -- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT -- WE NEED TO BE SURE BECAUSE MOST OF THE SITE AND THE SERVE TIES A LITTLE BIT TO SOME OF MY QUESTIONS AND THE BEGINNING OF AROUND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HEALTH OVERALL IS THAT. WHAT WE SAW THIS EVEN POLLING SHOWS THAT MENTAL HEALTH LIKE HEALTH CARE'S PRETTY MUCH ON TOP RIGHT -- OF OF OF OF CALIFORNIANS MIND AND AND ACTUALLY MENTAL HEALTH AS FAR AS HEALTH CARE DATE. AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT LAW MY COLLEAGUES LIKE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT AND THERE'S BY DIFFERENT BUILDINGS SO FORTH. ETCETERA BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO AYE FEEL THERE'S FRUSTRATION THAT THE FROM PEOPLE EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE FAIRLY INVOLVED IN MENTAL HEALTH -- THE THAT. WE DON'T REALLYKNOW WHAT'S. GOING ON RIGHT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ALL IT'S LIKE WELL EACH COUNTIES DOING THEIR OWN THING AND SO FORTH AND SOME OF ITS TO THE WAY WE STRUCTURED NOW THE THE PROPOSITION SO FORTH BUT ALSO THAT WE DID IT IT. IT SEEMS. I THINK PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING ACTION INFORMATION -- THE OUT IT SEEMED INDICATE THAT PEOPLE REALLY FIND RULES A START WITH YOU KNOW SECOND COUNTY FOUND OUT THE COUNTY OF SITTING IN A WHOLE. BUNCH OF MONEY AND THAT WAS ON THE ONLY OTHER COUNTY IN MEANTIME OR SAY WHAT WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THIS THE NATION TO SELL PROPERTY THE THREE GIVE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO ALL THE STUFF AND WE CERTAINLY SEE THE NEED. AND YOU'RE TELLING ME WHAT SPENDING THE MONEY AND WHAT'S GOING ON THERE RIGHT. AND SO IT AND AND THEY'LL LIVE WHILE CERTAINLY NOT THIS YEAR BUT YOU KNOW NOT SO MANY YEARS AGO PEOPLE START SAYING WELL YOU KNOW IS. THAT THAT DON'T DO WE STILL NEED THIS NOT THAT WE DON'T NEED THE RESOURCES BUT IS THIS NOW THIS IS ALREADY WORKING RIGHT. AND AND THERE ARE SOME CERTAINLY SOME I THINK SOME SOME SOMETIMES UNWARRANTED CRITICISM ABOUT WHAT THEY DID FIND OUT WAS BEING SPENT. I THINK SOMETIMES YOU ON VALUE PREVENTION TYPE ACTIVITIES AND PEOPLE STARTED PICKING ON STUFF SO. SO WE NEED TO BE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT -- BECAUSE THERE'S THERE IS NEED OUT THERE WE NEED TO ALSO FIGURE OUT HOW AND THAT'S WHY TALK ABOUT LIKE THINGS LIKE STATEWIDE GOALS AND SO FORTH BECAUSE IN SOME SENSES. BUSINESS WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING SOME REALLY GOOD STUFF AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND I CAN A TAKE OFF SEVERAL OF THEM BUT THE SAME TIME IT. PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE NEEDLE NESTLE MOVING AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE TO SEE IT RIGHT SO -- AND DOWN RIGHT HERE WE HEARD TODAY YOU KNOW WE SO SIDE RATES ARE GOING UP WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING RIGHT AND AND TO FEEL LIKE HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW NOT ALL OF HOMELESSNESS IS MENTAL HEALTH OKAY I'VE DONE MY COMPLETE THE TO BUT CERTAINLY DOES A PIECE RIGHT AND WE TALK. ABOUT RECIDIVISM AND PEOPLE MY GAME AT ALL THREE WE TALKED WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS AT A WHOLE HEARING ABOUT THAT GREAT. AND THEN SAID BOWL HOW ARE WE MOVING THE NEEDLE ON THAT YET WE HAVE. YEAH WE HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PARTS AND IT SEEMS HARD TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE ALL THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT IT SO -- SO I THINK -- YEAH I'M HOPING THAT SO PART OF PART OF ITS SMALL THINGS LIKE RECONCILING NUMBERS AND PART OF IT IS ALSO -- YOU KNOW AND THIS IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WORKING WITH COUNTIES BUT BUT I THINK WE DO WE NEED TO NEED TO THINK OF SOME KIND OF BETTER STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK THAT'S MORE. EXPLAINABLE I GUESS AS MORE COMMUNICATIONS VALUE TO THE PUBLIC THAT SHOWS THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING THE NEEDLE. AND HOPING WE CAN TRY TO GET THERE. HELLO MY THE CELL DAVID TELL ME IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THE COMMISSION IS COMING FROM AND PART OF THIS EFFORT AROUND BEING ABLE TO CREATE VERY EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE INFORMATION ON THE DOLLARS THE PROGRAMS AND THE OUTCOMES IN THE OUTCOME IS THE IS THE IMPORTANT PIECE. IS THAT IS OUR DEFINITION OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY PUBLIC OVERSIGHT -- IS THAT HOW CAN THE STATE THROUGH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING REALLY HELP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING BEING MADE. AND WHAT WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE THE OUTCOME WORK IS THE MOST DIFFICULT WORK -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOME ANALYSIS OF FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS. pOUTCOMES BUT OVERALL THE DATA EXPRESS A LOT OF CHALLENGE AND PART OF THAT CONVERSATION IS. AS WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE ARE CHALLENGES WHAT ROLE DOES THE STATE HAVE OR CAN HAVE TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY COUNTIES TO IMPROVE. AND IN SO PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING INTERNALLY ARE WHAT ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE CAN INCENTIVIZE AN INFLUENCE AND SHAPE. IN IN WAYS THAT ARE VERY MUCH INFORMED BY THE DATA ANALYTICS YOU'RE RIGHT SOMETIMES YOU DO HAVE TO DO THE MUNDANE WORK OF RECONCILING NUMBERS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE THAT LACK OF CONFIDENCE. WE CAN GET THE FUNDAMENTALS RIGHT LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY IS THERE. IWILL POINT OUT THAT IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ITS ITS VERY FOCUSED ON THE IMAGE TO SAY BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE DOLLARS THAT ARE EASIER TO TRACK. BUT THE IMAGES SAY IS ABOUT 25% OF THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. AND SO AGAIN. OUR THIS SITE THAT ALLOW YOU TO SEARCH TWENTY ONE HUNDRED COMMUNITY PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW -- IT'S NOT LIVE YET BECAUSE A COUPLE LITTLE GLITCHES BUT IN THE NEXT YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR DAYS IF NOT TOMORROW -- WE HAVE REQUIRED THAT CAN'T DAY COUNTIES BUT ONLY IN P. E. I. INNOVATION PROGRAMS TO REPORT ON HIS BEING SERVED BY RACE ETHNICITY AGE GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION VETERAN STATUS DISABILITY STATUS. AND SO THE INTENT REALLY IS TO MAKE IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE INVESTMENTS OF BEING MADE. WHO HAS ACCESS IN ADDITION? TO THE KINDS OF OUTCOMES ARE BEING ACHIEVED BASED ON THOSE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. BUT AGAIN THAT'S ONLY IN THE P. I. PIECE BECAUSE THAT'S THE LIMIT OF THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THE COUNTY TO SUBMIT THAT INFORMATION. AND SO YOU KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THE STATE COULD ENHANCE THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN PLACE TODAY WHAT'S WORKING. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT'S WORKING FOR WHOM AND WHERE BECAUSE WE DON'T RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH CARE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE RECEIVE IT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW BASED ON WHO WE ARE AND BASED ON WHO ARE NEEDS ARE INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IS VERY CAPTURE BULL. BUT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY AREN'T SET UP TO DO THAT AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ANSWER QUESTIONS WE CAN ANSWER WITH THE DATA WE HAVE. WITH THE INTENT OF DEMONSTRATING THE CAPACITY AND THE VALUE OF THAT WORK SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE THE STATE TOWARDS INVESTING MORE TIME AND ENERGY AND FOCUS ON THAT THAT LEVEL ABOUT COME INFORMATION. BIGGEST AT THE ON TERMS OF OF FOR DATES YES I MEAN IT'S AS YOU POINTED OUT. THE TOTALITY OF AN IMAGE A FUNDING IS ABOUT A QUARTER RIGHT NOW IT'S A QUARTER SO AND THE SITE PEOPLE DON'T SIT BACK AND GO AND HA FINDING ANY IF THAT AND BETTER A. L. AT IT. AND I GOT SADDER SO OFTEN IT'S A SO THE STORY NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED LIKE WHAT WHAT'S THE VALLEY'S MUCH OF THE POT AS POSSIBLE RIHT SO. AND I APPRECIATE THAT OFTENTIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE DON'T THE OVERSIGHT WE BRING YOU UP YOUR TOBY AND WE'RE LIKE MENTAL HEALTH AND LIKELY EARLY I I ONLY GOT THIS PIECE OF IT I DON'T YOU KNOW I OVERSIGHT YEAH I DON'T GET TO OVERSEE ALL OF THAT. GREAT SO. AS WE CAN IF THERE'S SOME MECHANISM WE CAN WORK WITH THE COUNTY TO TO PROVIDE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY TELL THAT STORY TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT WE REALLY DO WHAT WE'RE DOING MENTAL HEALTH AND ALSO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY THEN TO MOVE THE SHIP IN THE DIRECTION. THAT WE NEED TO TO BE SURE WE ADDRESS THERE AT THAT THE PUBLIC'S TOP PRIORITIES. SURE AND I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE STARTED THAT WORK I THINK. TO TELL BRENDA IN TERMS OF JUST HER SHE'S SHE'S BIG DATA PERSON SHE'S EXCELLENT AT AT THE PERFORMANCE OUT COME SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE THOSE OF NOW BEEN ADDED TO HAVE. THE RACE ETHNICITY AND SOME OF THE STUFF THAT THAT -- FOR YOU IN WAS TALKING ABOUT AND SO I THINK THAT IS WHERE WE'RE GOING AS WELL AND BEING ABLE TO REPORT THAT ON THE WHOLE THE WHOLE SYSTEM -- BECAUSE IT IS CONFUSING BECAUSE I WAS THE EMERGENCY MONEY CAN ALSO FUND MEDI CAL SO IT JUST BECOMES A WEIRD -- A WEIRD MIXTURE SO THAT IS SORT OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE STARTED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND AGAIN NUMBER AND HAS REALLY LED AND AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO BUILD ON HOW DO WE HAVE BETTER. DATE INFORMATION TO SHARE ACROSS THE MEDICAL PROGRAM ANYTHING YOU KNOW GOES BACK TO WHAT I SAID BEFORE I MEAN WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE HAVE JUST A FUNDAMENTAL PICTURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND WHO'S GETTING SERVICES AND WHERE SERVICES NOT GETTING PROVIDED AND HOW WHAT THEN CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT SO ABSOLUTELY -- AND I I AGAIN I I THINK BRENT AND HER TEAM IS DONE HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB IN GETTING -- A SIGNIFICANT MUCH AMOUNT MORE DATA THAN IT USED TO BE. HEARD ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE AND SO HOW DO WE THEN WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ALL I MEANT -- WITH WHAT MEASURES WERE LOOKING AT AND HOW WE'RE MEASURING THINGS I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND I KNOW I NUMBER AND IT DOES WORK PRETTY CLOSELY WITH. THE COMMISSION BUT BUT YES WE WILL OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE TO DO THAT. OKAY IS TO DETECT ADMINISTERED AIR. SO -- IN THE COMMENT ABOUT THE THE SO THE PURVIEW OF THE COMMISSION FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IS EMBEDDED IN THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE AND WHILE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT CREATED THE COMMISSION. THE CHARGES ON IN THE HOUSE SERVICES ACT ARE THINGS LIKE REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT. AND REDUCING HOMELESSNESS -- SUPPORTING EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN PREVENTING THE ONSET OF MENTAL ILLNESS SO WE ACTUALLY DON'T THINK ABOUT OUR PURVIEW IS ONLY IMAGES THEY FUNDED PROGRAMS THAT'S GOOD WE TAKE THAT WE SAID THE MONEY'S HERE. THE POLICY IS ACTUALLY QUITE BROAD AND IT'S ACTUALLY BROADER THAN THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENTS. WEATHER WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE UNDER THE PREVENTION LANGUAGE IT BEGINS TO TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE PREVENTING OUT OF HOME PLACEMENTS. AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE THINK THAT THE QUESTIONS PER VIEW IS OVER THE ENTIRE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. REALLY THINKING MORE ABOUT WELL BEING. AGAIN DRAWING UPON THAT PO THAT PREVENTION LANGUAGE AND SAYING HOW DO WE PREVENT THESE BAD THINGSFROM HAPPENING SO THAT WE ACHIEVE OUTCOMES FOR THE COMMUNITY.% THAT ARE NOT DRIVEN NECESSARILY BY ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS OR A MEDICAL NECESSITY IT REALLY IS MORE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH ORIENTATION AROUND MENTAL HEALTH THAT TALKS ABOUT KEEPING FAMILY SAFE HEALTHY IN SCHOOL AT WORK AT HOME OUT OF TROUBLE. AND AND AND WITH THAT PURVIEW WE THINK MORE ABOUT THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY IS PRETTY BROAD. IN THE SENSE THAT ARE AUTHORITIES TO ADVISE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THEN THE SPECIFIC AUTHORITIES THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED US THROUGH EITHER STATUTORY BUDGETARY THORNY WELL I I GUESS I'D SAY IS THAT. DURING FROM POLICY POINT OF VIEW OF MUCH BROADER RIGHT RIGHT AND IS IS ABLE TO PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH IS ON OF THE BACKGROUND PUBLIC HEALTH. FIRST STAFF DATA DATA SOCIAL STRATEGY POLITICAL WELL RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT JULIUS RICHMOND. I'LL CHECK MODEL SO RIGHT SO -- AND SO WE NEED WE DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW IT TOGETHER DATA IN A WAY THAT WE CAN GET A BETTER PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ACROSS NOT JUST ONE PART OF MONEY BUT ACROSS THE DIFFERENT POTS. AND THEN ALSO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT POLITICAL WILL WE HAVE TO BILL TELL THE STORY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT PEOPLE SEE THINGS AND THEY GO OKAY. WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING IN HOW DO WE BUT CAN. YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO TO TO BUILD OUT POLITICAL WELL OBVIOUSLY IS AN ACTIVE POLITICAL A CREATED POP -- SIXTY THREE HOW DO WE SUSTAIN THAT AND THE WAY TO TO BE SURE THAT BECAUSE IT. THE NATION ITSELF PROVIDE RESOURCES AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS BUT AT THE SAME TIME INCLUDING CREATE OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONS AND THEN HOW DO WE DIDN'T TAKE THOSE RESOURCES AND AND MOVE THE NEEDLE RIGHT. AND I THINK RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE SHIRT OR SEEN THE NEEDLE MOVE AS AS MUCH AS THEY'D LIKE TO SEE IT MOVE AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN DEPARTING WORK AND SOME THE EDITS THINK THAT. IT MAY BE FRAGMENTED AND MAY NOT BE REPEAL SHARED IN A WAY THAT. PEOPLE IT THAT THAT PEOPLE SEE THAT STORY PLAY OUT AS MUCH AS STATE LIKE TO AND RECOGNIZING THAT A GOOD CHUNK OF MENTAL HEALTH. PEOPLE ARE GONNA. DIVIDE BETWEEN THE PARTS YOU KNOW DON'T EVEN COME FROM DAMAGE AS A FUNDING RIGHT NOW SO. WOULD BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU HAVE A MOVING THE NEEDLE ON THEIR THE PSYCHOSIS -- WELL I'M LOOKING FOR A GOING OF ACTUALLY NEXT RIGHT OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS ALRIGHT WELL LET'S GO AHEAD AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE MOON AND YOU DON'T REALLY PSYCHOSIS RESEARCH AND TREATMENT. DO YOU WANT ME TO PRESENT THE GOVERNOR'S OVAL FIRST YES ONCE YOU GO HEAD. YES FEES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR I WAS THE ORDER IN THE AGENDAS OF JUST YOU KNOW TRY TO TRY TO FOLLOW THE RULES -- A AMERICAN WILL DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO YES SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PROPOSING A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION. IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS TO HELP FUND PROJECTS THAT DEMONSTRATE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO DETECTING. AND INTERVENING EARLY ON IN IN IN CHILDREN'S LIVES -- BEFORE SORT OF PSYCHOSIS HAS SAID INTERFERE AT RISK OF PSYCHOSIS THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN A LOT OF EVIDENCE OVER THE PAST RECENT YEARS AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY PROGRAMS FUNDED BY ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON AND OTHERS. THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AS AS A FOUNDATION FOR THIS PROPOSAL -- I'VE SEE WORKING AWFULLY WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WHO HAD THIS PROPOSAL AS AS ONE OF THEIR THEIR OPTIONS AND SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS THAT WOULD NOT JUST BE. TWO BIG THE COUNTY IS IT WOULD BE TO PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFIT ENTITIES AND REALLY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE SOME SOME SORT OF TESTING OF WHAT ARE THE BEST APPROACHES THAT THEN ONCE WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE HOW DO WE SCALED UP ON ON THE GRANDER STATEWIDE SKILL. WE THE REQUEST ALSO DOES ALLOW US USE A PORTION OF THE MONEY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE -- THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WE HAVE TO DO IN TERMS OF PETITIONS AND THINGS AND SO -- WE ARE WE ARE DOING THAT AS WELL BUT IT'S A PART OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. THANK YOU COMES FROM LA -- FINANCE. RIGHT ON YES THANK YOU SO A FEW YEARS AGO THE COMMISSION -- HIRED UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA DAVIS TO ACTUALLY DO SOME ANALYSIS OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS -- PSYCHOSIS OR THE PSYCHOSIS INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS WIDE VARIATION AND HOW COUNTIES ARE PURSUING THESE PROGRAMS AND MANY COUNTIES TO ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE OR THE PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS. AND SO -- A. B. THIRTEEN FIFTEEN THEN ESTABLISH THIS EARLY SECOND BE PLUS PROGRAM A PSYCHOSIS PLUS PROGRAM AND REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY BODY AND THEN MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE. FUNDING THAT WAS ENVISIONED TO COME THROUGH DONATIONS AND SO WE'VE ACTUALLY EXPLORED MODELS LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOW OTHER STATES DO. MODELS TO SECURE PRIVATE DONATIONS I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS VERY CHALLENGING TO SECURE AND PRIVATE DONATIONS INTO STATE GOVERNMENT -- BUT AS PART OF THAT ORIGINAL WORK AND THEN -- RECOGNIZING THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND SIGNING THIRTEEN FIFTEEN AND THROUGH OUR RLES -- WORKING WITH COUNTIES AROUND INNOVATION FUNDS WE WORK FOR THE UC DAVIS TO ACTUALLY BRING TOGETHER A CORE GROUP OF COUNTIES TO CO INVEST IN DEVELOPING AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND LEARNING INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE INTENT OF GATHERING THE DATA OUT OF THESE VARIOUS COUNTY PROGRAMS AND AND THEN UNDERSTANDING THEM AND AND ANALYZING THEM IN WAYS THAT THEY RECEIVE THEIR DATA BACK. SO THAT THEY AN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHICH APPROACHES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR WHICH KINDS OF PEOPLE ALL KINDS OF DIAGNOSIS IN BUT POINTS IN TIMES IN TERMS OF THEIR TREATMENT. THROUGH THIS WORK UC DAVIS WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH FOR COUNTIES TO SECURE A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. OF COUNTY INNOVATION FUNDS TO BUILD THAT LEARNING NETWORK WITH MORE COUNTIES INTERESTED IN SORT OF YOU KNOW BUYING IN ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS LEARNING THAT WORK AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN AN ADDITIONAL ONE AND A HALF MILLION IN PHILANTHROPY TO SUPPORT THAT. OUR INTENT IS TO ACTUALLY BUILD THIS LEARNING NETWORK THAT IS STATEWIDE THAT RESULTS IN EVERY COUNTY HAVING ACCESS TO AN EVIDENCE BASE. OR LEARNING BASED SB PLUS PROGRAM THAT OR STRATEGY BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT SOME APPROACHES WILL BE REGIONAL OR MULTI COUNTY COLLABORATIONS IN TERMS OF THE SERVICE DELIVERY. WERE ALSO PARTNERING WITH UC DAVIS UCSF AND UC SAN DIEGO IS PART OF A NATIONAL EFFORT TO BUILD A NATIONAL NETWORK OF DATA ANALYTICS AROUND HOW THESE EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS. CAN BE EFFECTIVE AND SO ON YOU KNOW IN SEEING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- AND RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE A PROGRAM WITH NO FUNDING AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS THERE'S A FIVE FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT. BUT THE COMMISSION IS ASKED IS CONSIDER MERGING THESE. TO OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO BUILD OFF OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE. BUT WE WERE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR NOT INCLINED TO DO. THAT WE WOULD WELCOME THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE OVER THE LEADERSHIP IN THAT ROLE IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE FOR US TO RUN THIS PROGRAM WITH NO FUNDING -- WHILE THE DEPARTMENT SEPARATELY IS ISSUING GRANTS. IDEALLY WE THINK THE GOAL REALLY IS THAT LEARNING STRATEGY AS YOU SAID IT'S THE DATA IT'S UNDERSTANDING. IT BUT IT'S ALSO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IT'S THE WAYS IN WHICH OUR RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC EXPERTS. AND PROVIDERS IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING SUCCESSFUL CAN SHAPE AND SUPPORT AND GUIDE OTHER COUNTIES TO ACTUALLY DO AN EFFECTIVE JOB. SO THAT WE CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY RESPOND WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS HOW EFFECTIVELY WITH ME RESPOND. AND WE WOULD SAY IDEALLY SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH THESE CONDITIONS TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE OUTCOMES INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE ACT. THANK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU SO -- THEN YOU'D GET AT IT SO. I DON'T MEAN TO SO IT IS THERE ARE THERE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ABOUT -- BECAUSE OF SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW WE HAVE ONE EFFORT GOING ON HERE WHICH IS NOW. WELL FUNDED THROUGH PRIVATE TODAY WHICH IS LIMITED RIGHT WELL WITH LEVERAGE THE COUNTY DOLLARS YOU DID THAT WAS NINETY DOLLARS ARE COMING IN RIGHT SO THINKING ABOUT. SAID IF AT THE YUBA HOW THE TWO COULD COME TOGETHER AS A YEAH I I GUESS I FINANCE OKAY AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AGAIN IS ONE TIME DOLLARS I I THINK WE ENVISIONED IT AS YOU KNOW. SOMETHING THAT COULD BE IT'S A ONE TIME INVESTMENT AND THEY COULD THEN PROMPT -- ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. IF YOU KNOW OTHERS SIEVE IF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY FIND IT. THOSE EFFORTS ARE A WORTHWHILE TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE WE JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL [inaudible] IS. AVAILABLE FOR NOT JUST COUNTIES AS NOTED -- RIGHT -- THAT IT'S IT'S AVAILABLE FOR OTHERS AND THEN ALSO A. B. -- THIRTEEN FIFTEEN WAS VERY SPECIFIC THAT IT DOESN'T SPECIFY STATE FUNDS IT'S IT WAS FOR FOR DONATIONS AND SO. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING PRECLUDING THE DEPARTMENT FROM ENGAGING WITH THE COMMISSION AND LEVERAGING THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY THAT THEY'VE GAINED WITH SOME OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE ALREADY DONE -- BUT AGAIN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WAS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SPARKS ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. BACK BILLS EFFORTS CAN CONTINUE TO BE DONE THROUGH THE COMMISSION WELL I I GUESS I GUESS WHAT I WOULD URGE IS IS THAT -- RECOGNIZING YOU HAVE AN EXISTING BALL. LAW RIGHT -- THAT SAID ONE THING I THINK WAS DOWN IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY BECAUSE AT THE TIME YOUR PRIVATE THERE WAS A SUPPORT WITHIN ADMINISTRATION FOR FINDING IT THAT'S WHY WE ALWAYS PUT IN THE OKAY YOU WANT. CREATIONS YOU APPROPRIATE MONEY WILL SAFE PRIVATE DONATIONS RIGHT BUT TREATED A CERTAIN STRUCTURE -- APPRECIATE ACTUALLY WHAT THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR BEING WILLING -- TO TO DESIGNATE EVEN ONE TIME AT ONE TIME FUNDS TO HELP GET THIS BUT AS THE SEEDS. THANK THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY SAY OKAY INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SEPARATE I MEAN -- EFFORTS SCISSOR IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT -- WELL WOULD NOW WE JUST TAKE THAT MONEY AND WE DUMP IT INTO THE YOU KNOW. AND AND TO BE THIRTEEN THIRTY FOR THE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN I EVER I THINK THE THING IS IT'S A OKAY WILL SAY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE HERE AND THINK HOW WE TAKE THE BEST OF IT. DOES SO THAT THEY CAN LEVERAGE EACH OTHER AND AND GET THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT GREAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT IN THE END THEY THEN SO. WHEN THE SUMMER MULLIN ROAD IS BILL HE DID IT UNDER TWO CONSTRAINTS THAT HE HAD TO FACE AND TO GET THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS? THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET BASED ON IT AND SO -- AND SO IN ORDER TO GET AGAIN I THINK WE ALL WANT. WELL TRY TO TACKLE THE SAME VOTE THE SAME ISSUE OR SIMILAR ISSUES SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW WE MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT RECOGNIZING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS A ONE TIME AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW FUNDING BEYOND COUNTIES I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. ALL RIGHT -- SO THAT DID NOT SAYING THAT -- WELL WE NEED TO TURN IT INTO THIRTEEN FIFTEEN I THINK LOW DIVIDE SAY IS LIKE IS THAT ARE SAYING OKAY WELL WE HAVE THIS PROGRAM HERE AN WE'RE GONNA CREATE A WHOLE NEW PROGRAM OVER HERE AND THEN WHICH IS ONE TIME ALSO AND THEN WILL HAPPEN IS IS THAT. THEY'LL TO TO SHOULD SOMEHOW COME TOGETHER. RIGHT. SAID. AT A TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT REYES SAID IN A ONE SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT IN SAYING THOUGH THAT I THINK YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION DEPARTMENT OBVIOUSLY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP AND THERE'S NOTHING FOR CLEANING THEM FROM HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS NOW. OKAY YEAH AND AND JUST AGAIN JUST TO NOTE THOUGH AS WELL A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO PROPOSALS THAT ARE. THE GOVERNOR'S -- WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS MEANT TO BE A COMPETITIVE GRANT OKAY THE CELL? WILL BE DIFFERENT BY AGAIN NOTHING FOR CLEANING AND FROM WORKING TOGETHER RIGHT WELL SHE THE SAME GOAL. IF YOU AS WELL WHAT WE WOULD ASK ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER INVESTING THE FUNDS INTO THE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN PROGRAM WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR WE RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION -- SAME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO YOU KNOW AGAIN THE THE LAW REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO APPOINT AN ADVISORY BODY OF SUCH A MATTER EXPERTS. TO ESTABLISH THE CRITERIA AND INCLUDING THE NOTION OF COMPETITIVE GRANTS -- AND ALSO YOU KNOW I THINK. IT'S THE IDEA THAT THERE IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT IS MOVING FORWARD THAT IS SECURED COUNTY DOLLARS THAT IS ENGAGING WITH OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS THAT IS BUILDING THIS COLLABORATIVE. AND SO WHETHER THAT WHETHER THE FUNDS ARE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE THROUGH THE COMMISSION. IT'S THE IDEA THAT THE STATE HAS ESTABLISHED AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS STRATEGY. AND IT IT IS. BACK TO THAT ISSUE A PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS VERY DIFFICULT ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION TO EXPLAIN. TO THEM THE CHECKER THE TAXPAYERS WHO FIND PROPER SIXTY THREE WHY THE STATE WOULD ESTABLISH A DUPLICATE STRATEGY. TO ACHIEVE A COMMON GOAL. THE SO WE WOULD ASK ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER AGAIN OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO PUT THOSE FUNDS IN THE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN PROGRAM. IF YOU'RE UNWILLING TO DO THAT BUT THE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN PROGRAM INTO THE APARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND FINANCES WILLING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. WELL THAT THAT THANK YOU I MEAN THAT I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION SO THAT. WHATEVER RIVERS WHATEVER WE HAD AND UP IN NAY THAT WE HAVE A HE IDEALLY A COORDINATED IS A UNIFIED WAY OUT OF THAT'S TOO STRONG A WORD BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S STILL AT THE FIFTY SICKLY STATE STRATEGY DID SAID OF THE STATE'S STRATEGY. THAT THE MOVIES FORTIN BUILDING ON THE INVESTMENTS VERY MADE SO BY THE ALSO CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE DIFFERENT -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING THAT DOES MEAN DOES I'M SAYING THAT THOSE CHARACTERS X. HAVE TO GO AWAY RIGHT -- SO LET'S -- AND DEALT BUT ANY BILLS WRITTEN AT THE TIME IT WAS WRITTEN SO AND BY THE WAY YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR SO WE COULD WORK AND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I WOULD MAKE THE MODIFICATIONS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE THING WORK THE WAY THAT. GOVERNOR RIDGE WOULD LIKE TO WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO WRITE BUT LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR RIGHT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- I THINK BECAUSE SO THAT CONCLUDES THE CITY INDIANA RIGHT. SO -- SOON WHICH GOT MY PAPERWORK. FOR UPS OF RIVER. OKAY BUT WITH THAT OKAY THE BILL DOES THE SECTION RIGHT SO OKAY BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES ONE AND TWO THIRDS PUBLIC COMMENTS -- SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT WELCOME. THE AFTERNOON ADRIAN SULTAN WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE FIRST WE'D LIKE TO SAY WERE INCREDIBLY SUPPORT OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS. AS OUTLINED IN THE BUDGET THESE PROGRAMS ARE ABSOLUTELY GAME CHANGERS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY FIELD -- THEIR EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THEY SEEK TO INTERVENE AT THE FIRST SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG AND A YOUNG PERSON. AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT TODAY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES IN OUR FIELD ABOUT RISING SUICIDE RATES THESE PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING SUICIDE RATES AND REDUCING HOMELESSNESS. AND REDUCING A CURSORY SINCE WE CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS THAT THESE PROGRAMS -- HAVE WE WERE THE SPONSORS OF A. B. THIRTEEN FIFTEEN BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH SET UP THE STATE'S FIRST EARLY PSYCHOSIS. PROGRAM AND WE WORKED IN pCOMMISSION FOR TWO YEARS AND PULLED IN NATIONAL AND STATE EXPERTS INCLUDING LEADING EXPERTS AT THAT ARE UC SYSTEM WHO -- KNOW ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS TO SET UP THE FRAMEWORK -- IN IT YOU KNOW FOR AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAM. AND IT YOU KNOW IT REALLY YOU KNOW IN THE ALWAYS HE HAS BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK -- TO SET UP THIS PROGRAM IN FACT THEY HAVE SET UP AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THE EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE AND JUST SENT OUT NOTICES TO ALL OF THE MEMBERS. AND THESE ARE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD IS OUR LEADING RESEARCHERS THAT THESE ARE YOU SEE PROGRAMS THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS OF LIVED EXPERIENCE THEIR PRIMARY CARE EXPERTISE SO QUITE A BIT OF WORK HAS HAS BEEN DONE HERE. AND IT'S ALL PART OF WHAT WE SEE IS A GREATER EFFORT IN OUR FIELD TO TRANSFORM OUR SYSTEM OF CARE WERE INTERVENING AT STAGE ONE AND TWO VERSES STAGE OUR IS WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. I'M ORRY ACCOMMODATION IS THAT WE ALIGN THE WONDERFUL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT WITH THE STATE'S EXISTING EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAM OUT THAT THAT WE SEE. THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU WELCOME. HELEN ROTH DELTON A TEACHER HOW THE KIDS -- ON ISSUE ONE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT DATA HOW TO COUNTIES WORK WITH SCHOOLS OR DO THEY AND THE SECOND IS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE MHS DOT HSA DOLLARS ARE SPENT AS THE MEDI CAL MATCH. WHEN A REALIGNMENT DOLLARS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE THANK YOU? WELL I GUESS THAT WAS PUBLIC COMMENT OF ANYONE WANT TO COMMENT ON THE THOSE QUESTIONS ARE NOT [inaudible] POINT. NINE I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WE DON'T KNOW THAT AT THE MOMENT RIGHT I WE'VE ACTUALLY DESIGNS THAT FISCAL TRANSPARENCY. DOCK AT TOOLS SO THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY REFER RECEIVE INFORMATION ON ALL. ALL OF PRIMARY SOURCES OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT A PARTY MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TELL THE THE WHOLE STORY INCLUDING THINGS LIKE HOW THAT DRAWDOWN IS HAPPENING. PART OF THE REASON WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THE MEDI CAL PIECES THE ONLY REVENUE STREAM WHERE THEY WORK THE STATE OR IN THIS INSTANCE THE COUNTIES ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. ACTUALLY HAS SOME DISCRETION IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT COMES AND THE OTHER THREE PRIMARY SOURCES ARE BASED ON AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER VEHICLE LICENSE FEES AND AND SALES TAX RIGHT. SO UNDERSTANDING. PATTERN IN TERMS OF LEVERAGING LOCAL DOLLARS TO DROUGHT ON FEDERAL DOLLARS IS ESSENTIAL IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT MIX. OF RESOURCES AND REVENUES GOING INTO THE SYSTEM AND IF FOR MAXIMIZING TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN DO THAT. WITHIN THE OPTION FOR COUNTIES TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THEY INVEST RIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THAT OUR DATE IS COMING IN WE WERE IN AND WE'RE NOT EXPERTS ON THE OTHER MENTAL HEALTH DATA -- BUT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT WORK BEING DONE AND WE THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE STATE'S AGENDA. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT -- IMAGES THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. AND AND WE'RE GONNA BEGIN WITH THE REVIEW AND WE DO HAVE A GOOD RIGHT UP AND SINCE AND SO IT'S LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE UP HERE AND I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE WE CAN KEEP IT VERY BRIEF I THINK SEPARATELY SO -- AS YOU KNOW OUR OUR PRIMARY FUNCTIONS ARE TO ADVISE THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO REVIEW AND APPROVE INNOVATION PLANS -- WE'RE DOING SOME REALLY EXCITING THINGS MORE RECENTLY OF THAT THE THE TECH BECAUSE THIS WORK AS AN EXAMPLE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES. TO DESIGN A SERIES OF MULTI COUNTY LEARNING COLLABORATIVE'S ON INTEGRATED SERVICES -- FOR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS ON STRATEGIES TO REDUCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT ON STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. I'M IN AGAIN YOU HAVE HEARD THIS BEFORE -- WE ARE WORKING TO DO DATA LINKING BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND SCHOOLS MEANT WE'VE DONE SOME ANALYSIS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. PART OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS ONCE WE KNOW THOSE CHALLENGES S I MENTIONED EARLIER WHAT WE DO ABOUT IT AND AND SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO THINK STRATEGICALLY. ABOUT HOW WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE IN THE STAFF WE HAVE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT TA. EXACTLY TO YOUR POINT DR PAN. THAT WE CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE AND TELL THAT STORY. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE WANT THAT NEEDLE TO MOVE AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL AND WE ARE SEEING EXAMPLES OF EXCELLENCE ACROSS THE ACROSS THE STATE. POCKETS OF EXCELLENCE IN THE BIG CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE TAKE IT OUT OF THAT POCKET OF EXCELLENCE AND MAKE IT A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE. AT AT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS TO BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM BUT INTEREST OF YOUR TIME YOU HAVE HEARD THIS BEFORE BUT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL OUR STORY. THANK YOU AND CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT -- THAT SELL -- ELEVEN COMMENTS. FINANCE [inaudible] RIGHT. OKAY SALUTE SAID AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION SAID THERE I SAID THERE IS THERE IS GOOD WORK GOING ON I DON'T I DON'T WANT ANYWAY IMPLY THAT THERE ISN'T -- AND THE OUIJA FIGURE HOW BETTER TO COMMUNICATE THAT SO -- OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS CENTERS THAT TRANSITION STAFF AND TEMPORARY TO PERMANENT -- YET I DID I JUST VERY QUICKLY WE DID GIVE YOU A LITTLE HAND OUT OF THIS IS OUR INNOVATION DASHBOARD THAT SHOWS. THE THE THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT THAT COUNTIES ARE MAKING THE TIME IT TAKES US TO APPROVE AND THAT AND THE COUNTIES THAT ARE -- INVESTING IN A PARTY THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT -- I ITEM TO SO WE HAVE LIKE MANY AGENCIES BECAUSE OF CHANGES OVER TIME WE HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS IN WHAT WE CALL THE BLANKET BEING FUNDED. BY THE COMMISSION WITH OUR OPERATING DOLLARS BUT FOR WHICH THERE ISN'T A POSITION THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS LEADING EFFORTS ACROSS MANY DEPARTMENTS TO RECONCILE AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ALIGNMENT BETWEEN HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE ON STAFF. AND BOTH YOUR CHART AND THAT THIS IS AND THE AND THE THE POSITIONS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET SO THIS IS A REQUEST TO SIMPLY -- ALIGN THE NUMBERS WITH THE REALITY AND THAT REALITIES CHANGED BECAUSE OF SOME ORGANIZATIONAL SHIFT THAT HAPPENED YEARS AGO OKAY. INCOMES FAMILIAL FINANCE ARE A GOOD OF ISSUE NUMBER THREE INVESTMENT MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS ACTS TRIAGE GRANT FUNDING. RIGHT SO WE PROVIDED YOU ALSO WITH A LITTLE HAND OUT THAT HAS -- ON THAT THE FRONT SIDE IT LISTS THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TRIAGE GRANT APPLICATIONS AND THEN THE COUNTIES THAT RECEIVED FUNDS -- BY COMPONENT YOU MAY RECALL THAT IN THE PAST WE'D SHARED WITH THE WITHTHE COMMITTEE THAT WHEN THE COMMISSION MADE THESE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO THE COUNTIES THE COUNTY'S PRIORITIZED BASED ON THEIR MOST URGENT NEEDS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS QUITE OFTEN. COUNTIES WERE NOT PRIORITIZING CHILDREN AND SO THE COMMISSION MADE A COUPLE OF DECISIONS. ONE IT MADE A DECISION TO SET ASIDE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY FOR CHILDREN. AND WITHIN THAT DESIGNATE A PORTION FOR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH AND AS YOU CAN SEE -- THEY WERE FIFTY FOUR APPLICATIONS RECEIVED THIRTY WERE FUNDED THE REQUEST WAS FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING AND OVERALL WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. LAST AT PRIOR TO LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION HAD RECEIVED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND COUNTY STRUGGLE TO SPEND THESE DOLLARS AND THERE WAS A LARGE -- POCK POCKET OF UNSPENT FUNDS THE COMMISSION HAD ASKED TO REINVEST INTO THE PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RECOGNIZING THAT THOSE FUNDS HADN'T BEEN SPAN RECOMMENDED REDUCING THE FUNDING DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF FUNDS THAT. MORE ACTUALLY REFLECTED WHAT COUNTIES HAD SPENT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT DECISION IN THE CONTEXT OF THINKING OF THESE FUNDS AS ACTUALLY. SORT OF PROVIDING A A UNIT OF STAFFING FOR COUNTIES AND IF THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT THE FUNDS WERE NECESSARY THEN LET'S REPURPOSE THESE FOR OTHER NEEDS. HOWEVER WE DON'T THINK OF THESE FUNDS AND THAT WAY WE THINK OF THESE AS INCENTIVE FUNDS. AND WE AT THE AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE THE SCHOOL COUNTY COLLABORATIVE'S. THERE'S TREMENDOUS UNDERSTANDING IN THIS BUILDING AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN OUR SCHOOL SETTING SCHOOLS WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE IN OFTEN NGUYEN WERE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH FAMILIES. IN WAYS THAT ARE MORE CULTURALLY AND SOCIALLY APPROPRIATE UNDERSTANDING STIGMA THAN THAN IS POSSIBLE OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR CAPACITY TO USE THESE DOLLARS TO INCENTIVIZE. COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS FOR EXAMPLE IS TREMENDOUS AND SO -- WE'RE ASKING FOR RESTORATION OF THE FUNDS NOT BECAUSE THE MONEY WASN'T USED ORIGINALLY BUT BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL TO USE THESE DOLLARS TO SHAPE HOW COUNTY SPEND THEIR OWN MONEY. IN WAYS THAT CAN ADDRESS ISSUES OF HIGH STATEWIDE CONCERN PARTICULARLY SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH BUT NOT LIMITED TO THAT. AS THE TRIAGE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TODAY IT IT AGGRESSIVELY FOCUSES ON REDUCING HOSPITALIZATIONS RESIST REDUCING CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. AND AGAIN IN THIS CONTEXT WE FOCUSED ON SCHOOLS THE COMMISSION IS ASKING FOR RESTORATION BUT ALSO CONSIDERATION OF FREEING UP CONSTRAINTS ON HOW THESE DOLLARS ARE USED SO THAT WE CAN CREATE A BROADER SET OF INCENTIVES. THE DOLLARS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES THEY'RE ONLY CRISIS AND WE SEE THIS AS ONE OF THE STATE'S MOST SIGNIFICANT TOOLS IN SHAPING HOW COUNTIES USE THEIR DOLLARS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THESE FUNDS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ALL TWO BILLION OF MHSAA BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE EIGHT AND A HALF BILLION THAT IS AVAILABLE OVERALL. TO REALLY SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF COUNTIES TO FOCUS ON ISSUES WHERE THEY HAVEN'T ON THEIR OWN PARTICULARLY WHEN IT MEANS IT CAN OVER THE LONG OVER THE LONGER TERM REDUCE STATE COSTS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES STATEWIDE. I THANK YOU LA YOU COMMENTS FINANCE. OKAY. THE SHOWS GOING AS YOU NEED ANSWERED THE QUESTION WHICH WAS THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT DO WE ARE WE OVERLY RESTRICTED THE FUNDS THAT WE NOT PUT ENOUGH INTO -- OTHERS T. AIR EDUCATING THE FOLKS THAT YOU TRY TARGET TO THIS TO WHY WOULD PEOPLE WEREN'T ASKING AS MUCH FOR THE MONEY RIGHT SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE VIEW THE YOU SAY WELL WE ARE TO GIVE YOU MONEY FOR ACTS BUT ACTUALLY THE RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARILY THE ONES THAT. THE OF THE FACILITY ACTUALLY USING THE MONEY SO -- SO AS SOON THAT'S PAR YOUR PROPOSAL IS THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO LOOSEN SOME OF THOSE CONSTRAINTS ABSOLUTELY YES OKAY -- DURING THE RATE THE PART OF THE REASON THE COUNTY STRUGGLE TO ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE LIMITED PERSONNEL. AND SO ONE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE HAD A VERY WELL INTENTIONED PROGRAM TO REDUCE -- E. R. UTILIZATION. RIGHT AT THE ISSUE CAME UP OF WHO WHO'S SUPERVISES THE STAFF THE E. R. OR THE COUNTY. OKAY HAND DELAYS IN NEGOTIATING AN ANIMAL YOU RESULTED IN IT THIS COUNTY ACTUALLY WAS I ABLE TO TAP THE FUNDS FOR TWO YEARS NOW BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFLICT GOING ON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FUNDS RIGHT. WE'VE PUT IN PLACE ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS THAT THOSE FAMILIES HAVE TO BE IN PLACE BEFORE YOU ASK NOT AFTER YOU ASKED IN ORDER TO SHORTEN THAT TIME FRAME. BUT IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THAT AT THE TIME AND I WASN'T HERE AT THE TIME. THE INTENT WAS TO SORT OF CREATE A SURGE OF STAFFING. PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS COUNY STRUGGLE TO SUSTAIN STAFFING WHEN THEY HAVE TO GET A THREE YEAR GRANT IT'S ALSO HARD TO HIRE PEOPLE FOR THIRTY SIX MONTH JOB I PARTICULARLY RECOGNIZING THE WORK FORCE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN THIS FIELD. SO ABSOLUTELY THE COMMISSION IS LOOKING AT THIS VERY DIFFERENTLY AND SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT SEARCH OF STAFFING. FOR CRISIS IT'S ABOUT HOW CAN WE CREATE INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT CLAVINET PARTNERSHIPS AND IN SOME CASES ON THE SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS THE COMMISSION RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS FROM SCHOOLS WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE. BUT FIRST BUT FOR OFTEN VERY GOOD REASONS THERE COUNTIES ONE IN A POSITION THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE STAFF TO APPLY. THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY PIECE THE LAW WAS PRESCRIPTIVE AND IT DID NOT ALLOW US. TO HAVE THE SCHOOL RECEIVED THE DOLLARS AND TO EITHER DO THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY CARE PROVIDER OR OR EVEN HAVE THE SCHOOL APPLY AND PARTNER WITH THE COUNTIES AND HAVE A GO THAT WAY. AND SO YES WE WOULD ASK FOR SOME LOOSENING OF THE CONSTRAINTS SO THAT WE CAN BETTER TAILOR THE PROGRAM TO THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTIES. ALL RIGHT MAKES LICENSED ME. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OKAY SO -- I THINK SO LET'S GO AHEAD TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVER SITE AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THE ITEMS WE JUST DISCUSSED. WELCOME.

WE WILL BE ADVERTISING ANOTHER FUNDING ROUND FOR THE PROGRAM ONCE WE HOPEFULLY HAVE LEGISLATIVE FIXES TO THE PROGRAM THAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE TODAY. WE WE ARE PULLED ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO SEE WHY THEY DID NOT APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM. AND WE RECEIVED A RESPONSE RATE OF OF PROPERTY 47%. AND WE ASK THEM -- WHY UP ALMOST HALF OF THE RESPONDENTS SAID AT THE SHORT APPLICATION PERIOD WAS AN IMPEDIMENT TO THEM APPLYING? A 6060% SAID THAT THE SHORT TIME WANT TO EXPEND FUNDS WAS AN IMPEDIMENT. AND ALMOST 70% SAID THAT LACK OF GRANT WRITING STAFF WAS AN IMPEDIMENT TO APPLYING. AND THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THESE PAYMENTS CAN BE ADDRESSED BY ALIGNING AND EXTENDING THE FUNDING SOURCES FOR THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION 30% SAID AT THE LACK OF FLEXIBILITY WAS AN IMPEDIMENT TO APPLYING. AND WE BELIEVE THAT CAN BE THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED BY GIVING CHAPTER THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE GRANTS FOR ANYONE OF THE FOR INTENDED USES OF THE PRO OF THE FUNDS. AND SO OR PROPOSAL. WE HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY -- WITH A LINE AND EXTEND THE FUNDING SOURCES FOR THE PROGRAM -- CURRENTLY -- THE TWENTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL APPROPRIATED AND A JUMP ON REPURPOSE REAPPROPRIATION ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES DEADLINES RANGING FROM.

PROGRAMS -- IN THIS REQUEST IS COMPRISED OF OF THREE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THE FIRST IS ONE POINT WE ARE REQUESTING ONE POINT ONE MILLION -- IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND A ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION ON GOING TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING THE INCREASES IN EXISTING JBC T OGRAM COSTS THAT'S PRIMARILY CENTERED AROUND. THREE OF OUR CURRENTLY ACTIVATED PROGRAMS IN SACRAMENTO CINEMA AND SEE AN DIEGO COUNTIES. THE SECOND REQUEST IS FOR ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE OF SEVENTY FOUR NEW GBC T. BEDS ACROSS FIVE COUNTIES.

THE NEXT ITEM IS ARE FOR THE HOSPITAL POLICE OFFICER ECONOMY AND FOR THIS REQUEST WERE REQUESTING TO CONVERT THREE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AND FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION ON GOING TO CONTINUE THE EXPANDED HOSPITAL POLICE OFFICER ACADEMY. I SAY TO THE NO BETTER AS GOING TO THAT AT THE TIME THAT THE HOUSE YEAH SURE ARMS THIS IS THE ONLY THIS IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PROGRAM UPDATES THAT WE HAVE COMMENTS ON SO -- WE AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE PICK ACADEMY DOES NEED TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE OUT ITS EXPANDED CAPACITY -- HOWEVER EVEN WITHIN A PROJECTED INCREASE IN OFFICER ATTRITION RATE THE ACADEMY COULD BE PRODUCING EXCESS GRADUATES WITHIN THREE YEARS. AND SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS -- HOWEVER IF THE OFFICER TUITION RATE IS LOWER THAN PROJECTED THE DATE AT WHICH THE ACADEMY IS PRODUCING ACCESS OFFICERS COULD OBVIOUSLY MOVE UP AND SO WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT. TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON ITS EFFORTS TO RECRUIT OFFICERS -- SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN MONITOR THE VACANCY RATE DETERMINE WHETHER IT FUNDING NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED WHETHER UP OR DOWN IN THE MEANTIME. OKAY THANK YOU IS ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE ON THIS FOR UPDATE. YEAH A I I THINK OVERALL YOU'LL SEE A COMMON THEME WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS BUDGETS IN THAT THEY WERE STARTING TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND TO IDENTIFY OUR REOCCURRING NEED. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SOMEONE OTHER PARTICULARLY WITH THE HOSPITAL POLICE ACADEMY AND THE ISSUE THAT YOU HEARD BEFORE -- BEFORE THIS WITH OPERATING EXPENSES AND EQUIPMENT.

PARTICULARLY WITH THE HOSPITAL POLICE ACADEMY AGAIN THIS WILL BE SOMETHING WILL MONITOR TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SEE THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED WILL BE ADJUSTING ACCORDINGLY OKAY. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ON GO AND CONTINUE THEN. THE NEXT ITEM IS AN UPDATE ON THE ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM. WE'RE REQUESTING ARE WE ANTICIPATE A SAVINGS OF ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND A REDUCTION IN TWELVE POINT SEVEN POSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELAY IN CONSTRUCTION OF THE FOURTH ETP UNIT.

FOR EACH OF THOSE UNITS -- BASED ON ANTICIPATED CONSTRUCTION TIME LINES AN ACTIVATION DATES -- WE ARE ANTICIPATING AN ADJUSTMENT IN THE COMPLETION DATE FOR THE PATENT ATP FROM SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS CHANGE RESULTED FROM A LONGER TIME LINE TO GET STATE FIRE MARSHAL APPROVAL. OF OUR PLANS LAST YEAR THOSE PLANS WERE APPROVED IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PROJECT IS CURRENTLY OUT TO BID AND WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE IN THE MAY REFRESH. ALSO JUST WANTED TO NOTE ON THE LINE ITEM THAT THE AGENDA -- BASED ON INFORMATION THAT WE PRESENTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INDICATED THAT THE FIRST UNIT HAS BEEN COMPLETED -- THAT WAS THE ESTIMATED TIME LINE THAT WE WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY I'M BASED ON WHEN THE TIMELINE ON THAT WE HAD WHEN WE ARE PREPARING GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOCUMENTS THAT THAT PERSON IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND HAS NOT ACTIVATED YET OKAY SO THOSE ANTICIPATED. BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE FIRE MARSHAL AND THE LEAD FOR THE FIRST ITEM FOR THE FIRST UNIT IT'S BEEN MORE AROUND I'M COULD JUST CONSTRUCTION CHALLENGES AROUND YOU KNOW SITE -- WHEN THEY GET INTO THE SITE AND THEY FIND EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT?

S. T. POP -- THIS REQUEST IS OF FOUR ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING TO SUPPORT THE INCREASE HOT COSTS IN HOUSING TO SUPPORT OUR CONRAD POPULATION.

DIVERSION -- PROGRAM BECAUSE BOOKING VERSION PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS THAT -- TO HAVE BEEN FOUND OR HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE FOUND INCOME TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES. ULTIMATELY THE GOAL THE DIVERSION PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE REFERRALS TO THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS TO DELIVER INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN BE SAFELY TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY OUT TO MORE APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. IN THE COMMUNITY TO PREVENT THEIR RE ENTRY INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OUR DIVERSION IMPLEMENTATION TEAM IS BEING LED BY A MISS EATON'S -- HAVE YOU BEEN HEARING FROM AND THEN DOCTOR AND KATE MORE BURTON -- FRONT WHO IS OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND DIRECTOR OF CLINICALOPERATIONS DIVISION AND THEY'RE GOING TO ANSWER THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT WERE I'M PROPOSED IN THE ENGINE. HELLO AGAIN. I'M IN A PROVIDE YOU A AS A RESPONSE TO THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WITH SOME COUNTIES RECEIVING AWARDS SO -- WE'VE TAKEN THE APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION OF DIVERSION THE D. S. H. DIVERSION FUNDING PROGRAM. SORT OF FOCUSED ON THREE DOMAINS AND THAT IS ONE FIRST COUNTY IMPLEMENTATION HOW CAN WE GET FUNDS OUT TO THE COUNTIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- TO TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTIES TO SUPPORT THEM WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS AND THEN THE THIRD DOMAIN BEING DATA COLLECTION AND RESEARCH EFFORTS -- ON THE COUNTY IMPLEMENTATION FRONT -- OF THE TOTAL THAT WE WERE WE WERE AUTHORIZED A HUNDRED MILLION NINETY ONE MILLION WAS EARMARKED FOR WHAT WE CALL OUR TOP FIFTEEN COUNTIES. AND THOSE TOP FIFTEEN REALLY COMPRISED -- THEY REFLECTED OUR HIGHEST RATE OF I. S. T. REFERRALS AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SO WE WORKED IN PHASES TO DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDING REALLY FIRST FOCUSING ON THAT FIRST BATCH OF NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS SO IN OCTOBER WE REALLY WE RELEASED OUR FIRST REQUEST FOR LETTERS OF INTEREST TO THE COUNTIES. ALL FIFTEEN COUNTIES RESPONDED. OF THAT -- WE HAVE -- CURRENTLY WE'RE WORKING WITH SIX COUNTY IS -- IN THE CONTRACT PROCESS ONE PROGRAM LA COUNTY HAS ALREADY ACTIVATED BEGINNING IN MARCH AND AS OF TODAY HAS ALREADY DIVERTED SEVEN INDIVIDUALS -- BUT OF THESE SIX PLUS AN ADDITIONAL THREE THERE ARE COMING ON LINE WE WILL HAVE COMMITTED. ABOUT SIXTY ONE POINT TWO MILLION OF OUR NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE HAD AUTHORIZED. AND THE PROJECTION IS TO SERVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT I. S. T. OR ASSUME TO BE I. S. T. PATIENTS -- FOR THE REMAINING EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION WE ISSUED A SECOND ROUND FUNDING REQUEST TO OTHER COUNTIES THAT MAY BE INTERESTED IN IN -- PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. THAT WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBER -- WE RECEIVED. LETTERS OF INTEREST FROM THIRTEEN COUNTIES AND THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE DUE LATER THIS MONTH IN APRIL. ON THE TECHNICAL ASSIST ASSISTANCE FRONT WE'VE WE'VE ESSENTIALLY PARTNERED WITH ALL OF THE THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS SO -- V. -- CALIFORNIA COUNSEL IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE OAC COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENTS JUSTICE CENTER. AND SO ON AND SO WE'VE REALLY BEEN BRAINSTORMING AND WORKING TOGETHER TO TO TO IDENTIFY WITH THOSE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS ARE OF THE COUNTIES -- IN FEBRUARY WE HELD AN IN PERSON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SESSION FOR TOP FIFTEEN COUNTIES REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE CANDIDATES FOR DIVERSION PROVIDING RISK ASSESSMENT TRAINING AS WELL AS LEARNING FROM ONE ANOTHER ON WHAT OTHER COUNTIES ARE DOING -- ON THE DIVERSION FRONT -- AND WE'VE ALSO DEVELOPED A SERIES OF WEBINARS TRAININGS ARE ALSO ON THESE TOPICS RISK ASSESSMENT -- IDENTIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY OF OF CLIENTS -- AND THEN WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED A A PUBLIC WEB PAGE AN INFORMATION PAGE THAT WE'RE USING IS SORT OF A REPOSITORY FOR THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE SHARING WITH COUNTIES IN THAT WE ARE FINDING -- ON THE SERVICES FRONT -- Y'ALL HAD ALSO ASKED FOR WHAT TYPES OF SERVICES ARE BEING -- PROVIDED TAR DIVERSION CLIENTS AND SO GENERALLY IT'S IT'S BOTH IN JAIL SERVICES AS WELL AS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY SO AS INDIVIDUALS ARE IDENTIFIED -- IT THERE ARE ASSESSMENTS AND EVALUATIONS THAT DO OCCUR IN JAIL -- TO IDENTIFY PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS WHILE THOSE CLIENTS ARE GOING THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY MAY ACTUALLY. BE APPROVED BY THE COURTS TO BE DIVERTED THEIR RECEIVING -- SOME IN JAIL TEATMENT AS WELL AS MEDICATION FOR STABILIZATION BEFORE THEY TRANSITION OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN ONCE THEY'RE IN THE COMMUNITY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT MOST OF OUR PROPOSALS ARE AROUND DEDICATED HOUSING TO SERVE THIS POPULATION. AND IN THE IN THE DEDICATED HOUSING WE'RE SEEING INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT -- MEDICATION MANAGEMENT ONE ONE ONE ONE AND GROUP THERAPY. THE SOCIALIZATION LIFE SKILLS AS WELL AS SOME SUPERVISION -- OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION TO OTHER APPOINTMENTS SUCH AS MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS -- ON THE ON THE COUNTY MATCHING REQUIREMENTS OF FOR LARGE COUNTIES WE DO REQUIRED A 20% MATCH WHICH COULD BE EITHER CASH MATCH OR IN KIND MATCH. IT. FOR SMALL COUNTY IS THAT HER WITH A POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OR LESS WE DO REQUIRED A LOWER MATCH AND THAT'S 10%. WE DO REQUIRE THAT ITS LOCAL MATCHING FUNDS SO THAT COULD BE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT LOCAL IMAGES SAY DOLLARS COUNTY GENERAL FUND -- THEY REALLY ARE PRECLUDED FROM MATCHING WITH OTHERS STATE FUNDED GRANT PROGRAMS ARE SUBTLY FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS -- AND ON THAT FRONT WE THROUGH OUR CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH THE COUNTIES ARE REQUIRING THAT THEY REPORT TO US ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WHAT -- MATCHING FUNDS THEY'RE USING AND THEN THAT SOURCE AS WELL THEY DO THEY DO TO PROVIDE A PLAN TO US UP FRONT BUT THEN WHAT ULTIMATELY HAPPENS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR MIGHT BE DIFFERENT SO WERE WERE REQUIRING THE COUNTIES TO TO REPORT TO US VALUATION. OKAY I WAS GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO DR WARBURTON TO TALK ABOUT THE OUTCOMES OKAY [inaudible] RIDLEY. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE INTEND TO EVALUATE THE OUTCOMES FOR THE PROGRAMS WE BASICALLY HAVE A THREE TIERED APPROACH THE FIRST IS THE BASICS WHICH IS. THE TWELFTH STATUTORILY REQUIRED OUTCOMES WHO ARE WE DIVERTING HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE DIVERTING ARE WE SEEING A REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF REFERRAL VII'S TEAS. ARE COUNTIES -- SERVING THE ACTUAL NUMBER AS COMPARED TO THE CONTRACTED NUMBER -- COMPARED TO PROJECTED NUMBER EXCUSE ME WHAT'S THE COST OF TREATMENT INTO THEY HAVE SOME A SUSTAINABILITY PLANS -- WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH COATING PROCESS THAT WE'RE OFFERING COUNTIES THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CODING THAT WE DO THREE UC DAVIS OF WITH SEVERAL THOUSAND NOW I IS TEAS AND THEN WE HAVE -- A SOUGHT NATIONAL PARTNERS SO WE HAVE APPLIED FOR AND RECEIVED A TECHNICAL SSISTANCE GRANT FROM THE SAME TO GAIN CENER WHICH IS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE CENTER. WE START THAT IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND WE'VE ALSO -- SUBMITTED A LETTER OF INTEREST TO MET WITH JAY POWER WHICH IS -- MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY CENTER FOR LINKING RESEARCHERS WITH STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HEY COME AS FAMILIAL. FINANCE [inaudible] SO -- YEAH ONE DISPOSAL FIRST CAME FORWARD -- I CAN REMEMBER IS AT THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I MEAN THERE'S SOME PRETTY AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR NONE NOW TO REDUCTION AND I. S. T. E. REFERRALS -- CARRY ON TRACK TO MEET THOSE. I MEAN I AND I REALIZE YOU JUST SAID YOU'RE ST GET GETTING STARTED BECAUSE SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE QUITE GOT THE MONEY OUT SEVEN YOU GOT SOME RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOU SAID. DID FIFTEEN COUNTY SAID YOU GOT SIX COUNTIES NOW YOU CAN ADD THREE MORE RIGHT. SIXTY ONE POINT RATE IS ABOUT 61% OF THAT EL AND I APPRECIATE DIVERTED SEVEN PEOPLE IN ALL OF LAST LAKE COUNTY I MEAN THAT'S A START BUT I SAID I HOPE THAT'S JUST BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY EARLY ON IT'S GONNA BE A LOT LARGER SEVEN FOR LA COUNTY. EL RIGHT I MEAN WE ARE PROJECTED TO SERVE AT LEAST WITH THESE NINE CONTRACTS ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE. DEBT AND DIVERSION AWAY THE THE LAW WAS WRITTEN IS THAT -- AN INDIVIDUAL COULD BE IN DIVERSION FOR UP TO TWO YEARS SO THAT THE IN THE NUMBER OF THAT WE HAVE PROJECTED TO REDUCE FROM OUR OUR WAIT LIST. MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE AN ANNUAL NUMBER BUT OVER AT LEAST A TWO YEAR PERIOD AND AND CERTAINLY NO FROM THE VALUATION STANDPOINT. THE CELL WILL IN NUMBERS NUMBERS BUT ALSO. THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE COST EFFECTIVENESS RIGHT I MEAN PART OF THE PART OF WHAT WAS PROPOSED LAST YEAR WAS THAT. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I THINK THERE'S A BENEFIT TO TRYING TO DIVERT DUMB IN ITSELF AS VALUE ITSELF THAT WAS THAT WAS -- SPINS THE OF LARGE BUDGET. SAVINGS THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THAT AS WELL RIGHT. FROM PEOPLE NOT GOING TO THE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. IT WOULD. ULTIMATELY REDUCE OUR IN THE WOULD BE SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE REDUCE FROM OUR WAIT LIST -- THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY TRANSLATE TO SEVEN PEOPLE NOT IN OUR BEDS BECAUSE WE HAVE A LINE GOING REFERRALS RIGHT SO IT REDUCES THE IT. RELIEVES THE PRESSURE -- AND HOPEFULLY WILL HELP US CLOSE THAT GAP AND EVENTUALLY NOT HAVE TO COME FORWARD WITH ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS FOR CAPACITY RIGHT EXACTLY YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUILD MORE FACILITIES IT DOESN'T COME. OKAY. HI BECAUSE OTHERWISE ALTERNATIVE IS. FOR COMING IN TO ME IS. SAY OKAY WE NEED TO BUILD MORE FACILITIES EXPANDER HOSPITALS AND SO FORTH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT OKAY.

ATASCADERO MEAN WATER SYSTEM WHICH HAS EXPERIENCE PRESSURE DROP PROBLEMS FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN YEARS -- WHEN WE HAD THE REDUCTION WATER MAIN PRESSURE PUTS THE MAIN FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM AT RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FUNCTION APPROPRIATELY? SO INSULATION OF THIS BOOSTER PUMP WILL CORRECT THIS ISSUE AND REDUCE THE REST TO OUR PATIENTS AND STAFF.

THANK YOU AND TODAVíA SAGE IS REQUESTING GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE FOR A 200-019-2000 TWENTY BUDGET NAME OUT OF THIRTY FIVE MILLION -- TO ADDRESS THE LONGSTANDING MAINTENANCE ISSUES THAT ARE REQUIRED THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT -- AS I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW OUR HOSPITALS ARE QUITE OLD -- SO WE'RE LOOKING TO USE THESE FUNDS TO SHORE UP SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RESOURCES AT THE HOSPITALS -- THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION INCLUDES PROXY TWO MILLION FOR LITERATURE REDUCTION RETROFITS. THIRTY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN ROOF REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENT AND ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION -- FOR ROAD REPAIRS ACROSS ALL FIVE FACILITIES. ANY COMMENTS LU.

ABOUT ONE POINT NINE MILLION A YEAR ADDRESSING THAT BACKLOG SO WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO COME FORWARD WITH A PLAN ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO IN A LONG TERM BASIS OUTSIDE OF THE SORT OF ONE TIME APPROACHES. ADDRESS THAT THAT -- BACK WALKING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALSO TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OF THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE APPROVAL OF SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON HOW THE BACKLOG CHANGE FOLLOWING THE PROVISIONS OF THE FUNDING. AND IF THE BACKLOG INCREASED WHY IT INCREASED AND WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING TO BETTER MANAGE ITS FACILITIES TO PREVENT INCREASES LIKE THAT IN THE FUTURE THIS WILL PUT THE LEGISLATURE IN A POSITION TO KNOW. WHETHER IT NEEDS TO STEP IN AND TAKE STEPS TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT BETTER MANAGE ITS ITS FACILITIES OR JUST THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THEY HAVE OKAY MAKING FINANCE. COMMENTS ALL RIGHT.

DISPUTE HIS NUMBER ABOUT FOR OUR BILLION OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE DOING IT MORE DETAILED STUDY BUT YET I WE KNOW WHERE THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION NEED IS NOW. OKAY RIGHT OKAY SO BECAUSE I THINK WE WE NEED TO THINK MORE SYSTEMATICALLY ABOUT THIS I APPRECIATE THAT AND THE BRAIN BRAIN THE THESE FORD BYE THINK WE NEED TO THINK. AND DON'T TELL US A LITTLE BIT A JOKE IS EVERY I THINK EVERY SEGMENT THE STATE WE'RE HEARING ABOUT SPURRED MAINTENANCE AND MAINTENANCE BACKLOGS AND SO FORTH AND ALSO I THINK THE OTHER PART IS IS THAT -- AND RECOGNIZING WE HAVE A LOT ROOFS AND SO FORTH YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS WONDER THAT YOU DON'T FIX A ROOF THAT DAMAGE GETS WORSE AND WHAT I MEAN. THAT IT DOESN'T STAY STILL ALL RIGHT IT'S JUST AND THOUGH. SO WE US WE NEED A PLAN TO START TACKLING THESE AND PRIORITIZING SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE FURTHER DEGRADATION YOUR FACILITIES. AS WELL AND RECOGNIZING ALSO THE NATURE OF OUR BUDGETS AND ECONOMIC CYCLES THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE WE HAVE A STRATEGY THAT WHEN WE HAVE THOSE FUNDS AVAILABLE WE CAN TRY. TO GET ON TOP OF THEM -- SO -- SO I GUESS WE'LL PUT A MARKER FOR TWO YEARS FROM NOW RIGHT WE EXPECT TO HAVE A THE BACK THE PLAN WILL BE SPEAKING BEFORE THEN ON OUR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION OKAY AND THEN IN THE MEANTIME HOPEFULLY WHEN I HAVING MORE DAMAGING BETWEEN. IT'S A BY THE OF IT BUT SO BY THE WAY I MEAN IT'S THE THINGS AS THIS QUESTION I KNOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR ASSESSMENT BUT OKAY THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR THIS YEAR IS THAT MEAN WORDS THAT MEAN ACTUAL SAYS IT. WE STAY STILL IS STILL FALLING BEHIND WITH THIS. THAT TAKES CARE OF SOME OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY NEEDS OUT OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED IN THIS THIS PART OF FUNDS BUT CERTAINLY WITH THE AGE OF OUR AND WE ALSO HAVE SOME OTHER CONSTRUCTION FUNDS THAT ARE -- GETTING READY TO KICK OFF AS WELL SOME SIGNIFICANT ROOF PROJECTS AS WELL SO WE'RE TRACK TACKING THE HIGHEST PARTY FIRST BUT CERTAINLY -- THE REST OF THE FACILITIES ARE CONTINUING TO THIS GREAT TO SOME DEGREE YEAR BY YEAR. OKAY SO -- BUT AGAIN I KNOW YOU'RE DOING ASSESSMENT I'M JUST THINKING LIKE YOU KNOW WE DO -- BUT I YEAH. IF YOU READ IT IF YOU RUN AN OFFICE COMPLEX OF THE OF RESERVE STUDIES I MEAN THAT I GUESS MY QUESTION. IS AGAIN. THESE ARE YOUR HIGHS PARTY PROJECTS I GOT IT SO WITH THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION ARE WE BASICALLY STAYING STILL ARE WE STILL FALLING FURTHER BEHIND I DON'T THINK I DON'T. HAVE DONE OVER THERE CATCHING UP A LITTLE BIT ITSELF IS A SMALL FRACTION OF THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION OF THE LORD'S. AFTER WE DO THIS THIRTY FIVE MILLION. HELLO OTHER THINGS ARE GETTING OLDER TOO I WAS GONNA BE A YEAR OLDER SO IS THIS IS THIS. IS THIS ABOUT BASICALLY GPS AT FOUR HUNDRED WELL I MEAN AGAIN YOU'RE DOING SAVE IT AT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ARE LEAST FALLING A LITTLE BEHIND ARE WE ACTUALLY GET CATCHING AND WEALTH CATCHING UP TO BE VERY SLIGHT ABOUT BUT I'D JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT WHAT. WHAT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GONNA BE STANDING NEXT YEAR? YEAH I I THINK YOU KNOW AS AS APARTMENT HAS IS MENTIONED THEY'RE DOING THEIR PLANS ARE RIGHT THE OVERALL NEEDS. IN ADDITION THERE'S EXISTING DOLLARS ALTHOUGH VERY LITTLE TO DO. GENERAL MAINTENANCE BY THESE FACILITIES ARE VERY OLD SELECT A TO SAY THAT YOU'RE STAYING ON PAR I DON'T KNOW IF I NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT NOR WOULD I THINK THE DEPARTMENT WOULD. I WOULD THINK THAT THIS HELPS. OKAY SO SO I GUESS AND AGAIN RECOGNIZING AGES FACILITIES AND AS YOU'RE DOING AS AS IF YOU'RE ASSESSING EVERYTHING RIGHT I ASSUME THAT WHY SHOULD ASSUME. I HOPE THAT IT'S NOT JUST BIKE OKAY WE NEED TO FIX THIS AND THIS AND THIS RIGHT BUT DAISY LIKE OKAY THIS IS THE LIFE CYCLE OF THESE DIFFERENT ITEMS SO WELL. WE MIGHT NOT SIX THIS YET. AN EX NUMBER YEARS WE ANTICIPATE WE WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE AFFECTS ADULTS THAT WAY YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT JUST A LIST OF THINGS TO GET FIXED RIGHT NOW BUT ALSO YOUR IF I CAN RESERVE STUDY YOU'RE SORT OF LIKE TO DISSIPATING WHAT YOU FUTURE CASTLE YOU. AND SO YOU KNOW FROM YEAR TO YEAR IF WE DON'T PUT X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS AND WE'RE FALLING BEHIND AND IT REALLY IS IT'S BEEN PROTECTION TO RIGHT I MEAN SOMETHING THINGS HAPPEN RIGHT NOW BAD WEATHER EVENT AND NOW TREE FALLS THE REASON YOU HAVE TO FIX THAT ONE NOW. WAS GONNA LAST ANOTHER TEN YEARS OR SOMETHING BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IT THE TERMS OF THINKING-OF THIS IS A MORE DYNAMIC THING THAT SIMPLY A ASSESSMENT IN A LIST OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED. YEAH AND WE DON'T HAVE OUR CAPPELLI PEOPLE HERE AT LEAST FROM FINANCE BUT THEY DO ALSO HAVE -- I BELIEVE IT'S A FIVE YEAR PLAN FOR THE RIGHT HOSPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AS WELL SO BEYOND JUST THE GENERAL MAINTENANCE. THEY ARE CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSING AND AND DOING THOSE THE PLANNING FOR THE LARGER CAP OUTLAY PROJECTS AS WELL OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK THATSERVE ALONG WITH THE LA I WAS SAYING WE WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE GOOD STEWARDS OF OUR PROPERTIES WALLS ARE FINANCES AND AS WE'RE PUTTING. TOGETHER THIS PLAN AND GETTING A SENSE BECAUSE BUT CERTAIN YEAH. SO SO WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT AND WHERE WE'RE HEADED TO AND I THINK THAT THAT AND SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS RIGHT AND NOW SOMETIMES FISCAL CONSTRAINTS WILL BE WILL. WE KNOW WE'RE FALLING BEHIND AT LEAST WERE CONSCIOUSLY DOING IT RIGHT AND IF THERE'S OPERATE TO CONSCIOUSLY GET AHEAD. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO SELL BUT IF WE JUST DON'T KNOW. WE THINK WE ARE WHATEVER SO WE NEED A ROADMAP. AND WE HAVE A PRETTY DETAILED ROAD MAP OF WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE OVER THE YEARS IN THE IN THE THE STUDY OF OUR FACILITIES WITH THE EXPERTISE WE HAVE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE MASTER PLAN WILL GO MUCH DEEPER TO THAT AND AND ADDRESS ART OUT YEARS TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. BUT CERTAINLY THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION REPRESENTS A LOT OF STUDY AN EVALUATION OF OUR SYSTEMS PRIMARILY ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF PATIENT SAFETY -- FIRELIGHT AND SAFETY FOR THE FACILITIES FOR THE STAFF AS WELL OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL. APPRECIATE WERE. SCRATCHING THE SURFACE HERE BUT THAT THAT THAT THAT. AND CERTAINLY WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM BUT SERIOUS STUFF BUT IT. I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW -- EVEN.
