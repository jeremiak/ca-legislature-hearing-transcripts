00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.007
CONCERNED THAT THIS HEARING

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.310

IN ITS SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS THE

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.592
LACK OF ANALYSIS AND

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.027
TRANSPARENCY OF THESE AMENDMENTS

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:30.262
CREATES A FAULT OF COMPLEXITY

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:31.397
FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.765

FIX PROJECT THOSE AMENDMENTS

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:44.977
WOULD ALLOW PERMANENT TRANSFERS

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:47.346
OF WATER BETWEEN SWP CONTRACTORS.

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:48.914
IN ORDER TO ALLOW URBAN SBP

AGRICULTURE AND CITY CONTRACTS

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:59.158

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.826
MORE OF THE COST. FOR THE WATER

FIX PROJECT I'M GONNA GO DEEPER

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:05.765
INTO THE WATER FIX PEACE BUT I

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.466
WANTED TO FOCUS ON THAT.

00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:09.068
LINE OF QUESTIONING AND THAT.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:12.571
CLEAR CONCERN WITH REGARD TO THE

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:15.341

TRANSPARENCY THROUGHOUT THIS

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:37.596
PROCESS SO I THINK BOTH LETTERS

BACKGROUND ON THE STATE WATER

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:09.548
PROJECT ITSELF --

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:11.183
IN SIMPLEST TERMS IT'S A STATE

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.685

BRINGS WATER FROM NORTH TO SOUTH --

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:19.291
IT'S IT'S QUITE LARGE --

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:20.793
ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE NATION

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:22.628
IT HAS THE TALLEST DAM IN THE

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:24.063
NATION IN ORVILLE AND THE

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:26.298
HIGHEST WATER LEFT IN THE WORLD

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.466
TO BRING THE WATER OVER THE TO

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.134
HATCH BE MOUNTAINS IN SOUTHERN

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.002
CALIFORNIA.

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:31.370
IT'S A SYSTEM OF RESERVOIRS

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:33.405
AQUEDUCTS POWER PLANTS AND

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:35.274

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:37.776
HUNDRED MILES.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:40.346
AND IT APSOS WATER TO THESE

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:41.480
TWENTY NINE LONG TERM WATER

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.249
CONTRACTORS SOME OF THESE

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:43.916
CONTRACTORS --

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:45.251
USE THE WATER DIRECTLY THEIR

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:46.552
CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT THAT

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:47.886
BRINGS THE WATER DIRECTLY TO

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:49.288
RESIDENTS AND SOME OF THOSE

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:50.256
CONTRACTORS ARE WATER

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:51.824
WHOLESALERS THAT RECEIVE THE%

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.792
WATER AND THEN IN TURN SELL IT.

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:55.728
TO CITIES AND COUNTIES ONE OF

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.663
THE LARGEST WATER WHOLESALERS AS

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.032
METROPOLITAN WARM WATER DISTRICT

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:00.566
OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:02.801
YOU'LL HEAR FROM --

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:03.102

MOST AS FOR RESIDENCES AND

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:08.974
BUSINESSES FROM ABOUT 30% IS

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:09.875
USED FOR AGRICULTURE SO THIS IS

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.644
A LITTLE BIT OF A SWITCH FROM

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.679
THAT OTHER BIG WATER SYSTEM THE

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:14.947
STATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:15.814
ON BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:15:15.881 --> 00:15:16.815
THAT PRIMARILY SERVES

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:18.317
AGRICULTURAL --

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:20.119
CUSTOMERS THE STATE WATER

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.254
PROJECT IS PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL.

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:23.489
HOW MUCH WATER IS DELIVERED

00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:25.891
EVERY YEAR REALLY VARIES VARIES --

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.293
IN PART BASED ON HOW MUCH WATER

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:28.794
WE RECEIVE AS A STATE --

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:30.429
IN RAIN AND SNOW FALL IN A GIVEN

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:31.930
YEAR BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:34.233
SALINITY IN THE DELTA WATER

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.601
NEEDED FOR MIGRATING FINISH

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:36.735
THEIR STATE AND FEDERAL

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:38.704
REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT GOVERN

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.439
HOW MUCH WATER CAN BE PUMPED IN

00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:41.974
THE SET THROUGH THE PUMPS IN THE

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:44.243
SOUTH OF THE DELTA.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.278
I'M DOWN TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:47.946
THE LONG TERM AVERAGE.

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:49.615
ACROSS THE PAST TEN YEARS IS ONE

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:51.250
POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRE FEET

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.085
HAS BEEN DELIVERED.

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:55.054
THROUGH THE STATE WATER PROJECT --

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.555
THIS IS MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT THE

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:58.724
DATA WOULD YOU W. R. DOCUMENT

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.292
STATE CAN BE THE FULL OPERATING.

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:01.794
KAT CAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM IN

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.162
PART BECAUSE OF THOSE LIMITING

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:04.229
FACTORS THAT I MENTIONED

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.165
ALTHOUGH THAT THIS THE PROJECT

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.833
IS NEVER DELIVERED THE FULL

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.635
AMOUNT OF WHAT IS STATED AS ITS

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:11.704
OPERATING CAPACITY --

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.238
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:14.473
SYSTEM DELIVERED TWO POINT FIVE

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.342
MILLION ACRE FEET SO HIGHER THAN

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:17.576
THE LONG TERM AVERAGE SINCE WE

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.446
HAD A RELATIVELY WENT YEAR IN

00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:21.580
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.082
SEVENTEEN AS AS WE ALL KNOW THAT

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:24.416
MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED A MAJOR

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:25.818
MODIFICATION TO THE STATE WATER

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:27.186
PROJECT IN THE DELTA.

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:28.821
KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA WATER FIX

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:30.456
AND THAT PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:32.458
THE PROCESS OF SEEKING

00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:34.460
REGULATORY AND PERMISSIONS AND

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:37.830
FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

00:16:37.896 --> 00:16:39.465
TURN TO PAGE.

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:40.399
THREE HIS SYSTEM MAP OF THE

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.835
SYSTEM TO PROVIDE OF FOR THOSE

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:44.703
OF US WHO ARE VISUAL LEARNERS --

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.705
MAKE OR A BILL AT THE TOP OF THE

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.807
FEATHER RIVER IS THE LARGEST

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.309
RESERVOIR IN THE SYSTEM.

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:51.610
AND YOU CAN SEE THE DELTA IS THE

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.078
SPIDER WEB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:55.080
MAP AND THEN THE STARK LINES ARE

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:57.750
THE THE MAIN AQUEDUCT CALIFORNIA

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:58.717
AQUEDUCT THAT BRINGS THE WATER

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.085
TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA --

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:01.620
I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS JUST

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:04.256
SHOWS THE STATE OWNED FACILITIES

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:06.525
THERE ARE MANY LOCAL AND AND

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:08.260
ALSO FEDERALLY OWNED --

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:08.894
FACILITIES THAT BRING THAT WATER

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.830
TO THE LAST TWELVE CITIES THAT

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:28.013
YOU SAID

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:03.849
WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:20.833
THESE LONG TERM CONTRACTS

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:56.134
SIX

00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:57.336
SIXTY ARMS TO DECEMBER THIRTY

00:18:57.402 --> 00:18:59.872
FIRST. TWENTY EIGHTY FIVE ONE OF

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:01.006
THE MAJOR CHANGES IS ABOUT THE

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:03.342
BILLING AND FOR CAPITAL COSTS

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:04.576
CHANGING FROM THE CURRENT

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:07.312
CONTRACTS OF WHERE --

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:08.747
COSTS MUST BE AMORTIZED OVER

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.816
MANY YEARS TO PAY AS YOU GO

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.384
SYSTEM --

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.952
THERE'S A PROVISION TO INCREASE

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.487
THE INCREASE THE ALLOWABLE

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:17.589
RESERVE --

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:20.759
AMOUNT FOR THE PROJECT --

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.561
IT EXTENDS EXPANDS THE

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:23.695
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DATE OF

00:19:23.762 --> 00:19:25.597
YOUR CAN ISSUE WATER SYSTEM

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:27.733
FACILITY REVENUE BONDS FOR

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:29.268
CAPITAL PROJECTS SO WHEN THE

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.904
CURRENT CONTRACT IT'S LIMITED --

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.639
TO FACILITIES IN ORDERTO TO

00:19:33.705 --> 00:19:34.907
ISSUE THESE BONDS IS LIMITED TO

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:36.808
FACILITIES THAT WERE IN PLACE

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:38.143
BEFORE.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.744
NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SO THIS

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.979
WOULD ALLOW FOR ISSUING THESE

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.247
TYPES OF BONDS FOR NEW

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.815
FACILITIES --

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.217
IT ESTABLISHES A NEW FINANCE

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:46.451
COMMITTEE FOR D. W. R. AND

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.020
CONTRACTORS TO DISCUSS WITH EACH

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:49.388
OTHER --

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:49.955
FINANCIAL PROVISIONS OF THE

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.790
PROJECT AND THEN FINALLY THE

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:52.925
LAST BULLET.

00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:54.426
SOMETHING THAT THE CHAIR NOTED

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:55.694
IT DOES NOT INCLUDE PROVISIONS

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:58.297
THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO

00:19:58.363 --> 00:19:59.898
CALIFORNIA WATER FIX BUT I JUST

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:01.867
SPEND A MA'AM MOMENT ADDRESSING

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:02.801
THAT.

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:04.036
WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS IT

00:20:04.102 --> 00:20:05.938
DOESN'T INCLUDE PROVISIONS

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:07.573
RELATED TO HOW WATER FIX COSTS

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:08.740
WOULD BE ALLOCATED ACROSS THE

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.709
CONTRACTORS ARE HOW ANY WATER

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:12.044
THAT WOULD COME AS A RESULT OF

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.478
THE WATER FIX PROJECT WOULD BE

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:14.246
ALLOCATED?

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:15.347
THAT IS BEING NEGOTIATED IN A

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:16.615
SEPARATE CONTRACT AMENDMENT

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:19.351
RIGHT NOW THAT IS NOT PART OF

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:20.385
WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY.

00:20:20.452 --> 00:20:22.321
BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW SOME OF

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:24.323
THESE TERMS CLEARLY WOULD AFFECT

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.291
AND FACILITATE A WATER FIX

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.226
PROJECT IF IT WERE TO GO FORWARD.

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:29.895
FOR EXAMPLE --

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:31.430
THE ABILITY.

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:33.098
TO ISSUE NEW WATER SYSTEM

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:34.433
FACILITY REVENUE BONDS FOR A NEW

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:35.867
FACILITY CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:37.336
ESSENTIAL IF A WATER FIX PROJECT

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:39.171
WERE TO GO FORWARD --

00:20:39.237 --> 00:20:41.707
EXTENDING THE CONTRACT TERMS TO

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:42.975
FINANCE AIMING A PROJECT

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:44.810
FINANCING OF A PROJECT CLEARLY

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:46.278
WOULD BE ESSENTIAL.

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:47.746
SO I THINK ONE WAY THAT MIGHT BE

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:50.415
HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS --

00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:52.184
SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THESE

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.752
AMENDMENTS BEFORE YOU.

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:55.120
WOULD WOULD FACILITATE AND

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:57.456
PROBABLY BE NECESSARY FOR WATER

AND HOPEFULLY COMING UP I'M.

00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:08.673
YOU KNOW I THINK THE WAY IT HAS

SUBSEQUENT PANELISTS WILL

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:00.652
ADDRESS THAT I THINK ONE OF THE

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:02.420
BIG RATIONALES IS --

00:27:02.487 --> 00:27:04.122
THAT.

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:06.291
THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTORS OFTEN

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:07.792
TAKE OUT BONDS IN ORDER TO

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:09.194
FINANCE SOME OF THE COSTS OF THE

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.830
REPAIRS ST I'M GOING OPERATIONS

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:12.630
AND MAINTENANCE AND THE SHORTER

00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:14.499
TERM -- ON

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:15.767
YOUR CONTRACT THE HARDER IT IS

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:17.035
TO GO GET FINANCING FOR THOSE

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:18.303
TYPES OF PROJECTS AND HIGHER

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.738
INTEREST COSTS THAT THOUGH THAT

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:20.839
THE REPAIRS ULTIMATELY HAVE TO

00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:22.040
PACE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:27:22.107 --> 00:27:23.475
STRONGEST RATIONALES THAT WE'VE

00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:24.809
THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US BUT

00:27:24.876 --> 00:27:26.144

ABOUT FROM THE CONTRACTORS AND

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:28.313
SUB CMPANIONS.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.115
THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN WE

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:32.951
LOOK AT SONS IN SOME INSTANCES

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:34.419
ENVIRONMENTAL.

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:35.153
PROTECTIONS.%

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.190
ARE SUSPECT IN AND PUT IT PUT IT --

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:41.493
TO RISK BECAUSE OF A DEBT

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:42.961
SERVICE MAYBE --

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.295
YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE

00:27:44.362 --> 00:27:49.834
ENVIRONMENT IN THE THE FISSION

00:27:49.901 --> 00:27:51.002
POSSIBLY.

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:53.838
IT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE --

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:55.907

00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:02.714

00:28:04.783 --> 00:28:06.184
AND THE BEST --

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:08.186
YOU KNOW INTEREST OF PROTECTING

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.587

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND I

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:18.930

A HIGH SPEED RAIL AS A AS AN

00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:22.267

AND WHO'S GOING TO BEAR THE

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:28.807
BRUNT OF THAT.

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.375
IF IT DOES GO IN PEOPLE A

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:31.576
KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:32.710

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:33.945

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:57.502

YEAR.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.338
THAT DOES SERVICE DOESN'T STOP

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:00.972
AND IF THEY'RE NOT TRANSFERRING

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.807
WATER.

00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:04.976
OKAY WATER PRICES GO UP TO PAY

00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:07.345

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:13.184
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT ALL OF THOSE

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.553

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:20.658
ECONOMY --

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:23.661
AND THE SUBSEQUENT POSSIBILITY

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:26.097

SOMEBODY WAS OUT --

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:30.235
SO IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT YOU

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:30.935
ASKING ABOUT THE WATER FIX

00:29:31.002 --> 00:29:34.973

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:50.054
WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WE'RE

00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:51.523

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:25.023
CLEARLY STILL YEARS AWAY THE

00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:27.158
EXPIRATION I DO THINK THEY ARE

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:28.693

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.728

ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO WHAT THE

00:30:36.634 --> 00:30:37.902
FISCAL IMPLICATIONS WOULD BE YOU

HAVE TO DEFER TO THEM TO MAKE

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:41.839
THAT CASE --

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:43.641
I THINK CLEARLY AS I STATED

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:45.376
EARLIER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:46.911
WATER FIX GOES THROUGH OR NOT

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:48.913
FROM AN OPERATIONS PERSPECTIVE

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.015
OF THE EXISTING PROJECT AT SOME

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:51.783
POINT.

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.284
THESE --

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.686
EXISTING CONSTRAINTS WILL START

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:56.621
TO BE PROBLEMS AND WHEN WILL

RATHER TO LOOK AT THAT CONTRACT

00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:16.674

AND IT IS IN THIS IS A SIMILAR

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:55.873
THING WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.975
THE STATE'S WATER GRID SIMILAR

00:32:58.042 --> 00:32:59.911
TO THE ENERGY GRID AND EVERYBODY

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:01.112

BE DELIVERED AS IT NEEDS TO BE

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:16.461

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:08.339
SHIP THIS AMORTIZATION TO A PAY

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:09.940
AS YOU GO SYSTEM.

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:11.108
AND THIS EFFECTIVELY BETTER

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:12.376
MATCHES REVENUES WITH

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.245
EXPENDITURES.

00:40:14.311 --> 00:40:15.613
IT ALSO INCREASES ARE OPERATING

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.348
OF RESERVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:18.682
TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT FROM

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:20.751
THIRTY MILLION. TO ONE HUNDRED

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.219
FIFTY MILLION AN AMOUNT WHICH

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:23.621
BETTER REFLECTS THE REALITY OF

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:25.122
OPERATING A WATER UTILITY OF

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:26.223
THIS SIZE.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:26.757
AND IT WAS DERIVED FROM AN

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:29.193
ASSESSMENT OF SOME SHE WAITED

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.961
UTILITIES AND AN ESTIMATE OF

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:33.764
FUTURE OPERATING EXPENSES.

00:40:33.831 --> 00:40:35.499
IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A FINANCE

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:37.401
COMMITTEE TO RECOMMEND FINANCIAL

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:38.435
POLICIES SUCH AS APPROPRIATE

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:41.005
DEMINT DEBT LIMITS AND CRITERIA

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:42.339
FOR PROJECTS TO BE FINANCED OR

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.108
PAID FOR IN THE YEAR OF THE

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:46.343
INCURRED COST.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.645
AND FINALLY --

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:48.579
THE AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:49.880
ESTABLISHES A REINVESTMENT

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:50.981
ACCOUNT.

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:51.882
THIS WOULD FUND SOME OF THE

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.117
CAPITAL PROJECTS IN LIEU OF

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:55.119
ISSUING ADDITIONAL REVENUE BONDS

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:56.387
AND A SUPPORT ACCOUNT THAT WOULD

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:58.155
FUN ACTIONS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD

00:40:58.222 --> 00:40:59.557
NOT BE CHARGEABLE TO THE WATER

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.158
CONTRACTORS AS WATER SUPPLY

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:03.260
CHARGES.

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:06.096
I DO WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.565
THE THE THEME OF THE INTER

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:09.633
RELATEDNESS OF THE CONTRACT

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.368
EXTENSION TO THE WATER FIX

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:12.703
PROJECT.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.104
AND THE AMENDMENT THAT IS THE

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:15.539
CONTRACT AMENDMENT THAT IS UNDER

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:18.209
WAY IT RELATED TO THAT PROJECT.

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:20.044
I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN MUCH

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.712
DISCUSSION ABOUT IT AND IT'S IT

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:23.514
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:25.049
THAT WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY IS

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:26.550
ESSENTIALLY --

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:27.885
IT'S CRITICAL TO THE FINANCIAL

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.220
UNDERPINNING OF THE STATE WATER

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:31.622
PROJECT AND OUR ABILITY TO RUN

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:32.723
THE LITERALLY BILLIONS OF

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.291
DOLLARS OF ASSETS WE ALREADY

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:35.759
HAVE IN THE GROUNDS THAT ARE

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:38.996
MOVING WATER ALL OVER CALIFORNIA.

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:41.098
WATER FIX AS I MENTIONED HAS ITS

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:43.033
OWN SEPARATE CONTRACT AMENDMENT

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.169
PROCESS THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:47.538
WAY WE'VE HANDLED OTHER PROJECTS

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:49.039
THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT.

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:50.441
RECENTLY THAT SUPPORT THE STATE

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:52.877
WATER PROJECT THAT INCLUDES THE

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:55.145
SOUTH BAY AQUEDUCT IT INCLUDES

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:56.714
THE EAST BRANCH OF THE AQUEDUCT

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.449
DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

00:41:58.515 --> 00:41:59.617
IT INCLUDES --

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.452
PORTIONS OF THE COASTAL AQUEDUCT

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:03.354
THAT SERVE THE COAST A PORTION

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.989
OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA --

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.423
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA RATHER.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.726
SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON THAT THE

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:10.861
DEPARTMENT PURSUES A SEPARATE

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:13.597
CONTRACT AMENDMENT WHEREBY WE

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:15.799
ESTABLISH HOW COST FOR THAT

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:17.268
PARTICULAR PROJECT WOULD BE

00:42:17.334 --> 00:42:18.702
ALLOCATED AMONG ITS CONTRACTORS

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:19.937
AND CHARGED.

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:21.372
THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:26.610
OF AND AS FOLKS HAVE MENTIONED --

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:27.678
THAT IS --

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:29.780
IS INTERRELATED BUT VERY MUCH

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:32.283
SEPARATE FROM THE NEED FOR THE

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:33.617
CONTRACT EXTENSION IN THE MET

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:35.486
AMENDMENT THAT WE PRESENT BEFORE

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:37.121

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:38.689
I'D BE DELIGHTED TO ANSWER ANY

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:40.124

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.692
AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU TODAY AND

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:43.294
AND OUR PROCESS ON THE WATER FIX

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.728
AMENDMENT AS WELL.

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:47.298
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:48.599

TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:00.311
THIS -- AT

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:02.313
THE JULY THIRD HEARING AT THAT

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.682

RESPONDED THAT QUOTE A REVISED

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:14.692
ESTIMATE WAS IN THE WORKS IN THE

00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:16.327
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAPPEN BY THE

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:18.095
END OF THE SUMMER I PUSHED HARD

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:19.863
TO GET A SENSE OF TIMING.

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.131

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:33.444
WITH THE LEGISLATURE I'D LIKE TO

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.379
KNOW WHY.

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:36.580
AND WHEN WE CAN EXPECT IT.

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:39.249

I'LL OPEN UP TO COMMITTEE

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.058
QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO FOR YOU

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:48.792

00:43:48.859 --> 00:43:51.295
FIRST.

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:53.197
DON'T EVERYONE JUMP AT ONCE I

FULLER -- TO

00:44:00.938 --> 00:44:02.339
ME IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE KIND OF

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:04.174
GOT TWO QUESTIONS BEFORE US HERE

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:06.276
THAT WE'RE TRYING --

00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:08.145
TO LAY OUT --

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:09.646
SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:10.981
WITH WHATEVER WE'RE GOING TO DO

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:12.182
AT THE END OF THIS MEETING

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:15.219
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:16.553
DOING IN THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.189
AND IN THE WAY OF MAYBE MORE

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:20.691
OVERSIGHT OR DIFFERENT OVERSIGHT.

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:23.727
UP ONE IS --

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:25.996
WHAT THE EFFECT ON THE LIST CALL

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:27.664
IT WATER GREETED AS?

00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:30.367
HE IS -- FOR

00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:32.736
A DAILY USE AND REGULARLY USE

00:44:32.803 --> 00:44:34.872
ACROSS THE STATE AND THE OTHER

00:44:34.938 --> 00:44:38.642
IS WHAT IS THE EFFECT F WATER

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:41.145
FIX AND ITS AMENDMENTS AND IT

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:42.579
SEEMS LIKE BASICALLY WE'VE LAID

00:44:42.646 --> 00:44:45.449
OUT TO DIFFERENT OPTIONS NOW.

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.885
AND I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE FOR A

00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:50.354
MINUTE --

00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:52.456
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT SOME STATE

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:54.892
WATER CONTRACTORS HAVE ALREADY

00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:57.327
CONTACTED YOU ASKING FOR AUTO

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:58.996
RENEWAL OF THEIR CONTRACT WHICH

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:00.464
WAS ALLOWED IN THEIR CONTRACTS

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.299
BECAUSE IT PUTS THEM IN A

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:03.901
DIFFICULT POSITION NOT TO BE

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.669
ABLE TO REFINANCE BEYOND

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:06.804
SEVENTEEN YEARS NOT.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:07.771
TO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:08.906
THESE HUGE FACILITIES IF YOU

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:10.541
THINK ABOUT YOUR WATER PLANTS IN

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:12.810
YOUR YOUR DISTRICTS AND YOU KNOW

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.912
THE MILES AND MILES OF PIPELINES

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:16.713
AND THE EMPLOYEES AND ALL OF

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.015
THAT PEOPLE WHO.

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.817
DEPEND ON THOSE WHOLESALE WATER

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:22.619
SUPPLIES GETTING THEM.

00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:24.188
THOSE AREN'T JUST GOING TO GO

00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:25.989
AWAY SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:28.659
FINANCE THEM AND SEVENTEEN YEARS

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.027
IS YOU CAN'T EVEN HARDLY FINANCE

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:31.662
HOUSE FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS MUCH

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:32.529
LESS.

00:45:32.596 --> 00:45:34.965
THIS KIND OF FACILITY SO ISN'T

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:36.066
IT TRUE THAT SOME OF THE STATE

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:37.334
WATER CONTRACTORS HAVE ALREADY

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:39.269
ASKED FOR AUTO RENEWAL.

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:42.206
AS WAS ALLOWED IN A CONTRACT BUT

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:44.775
MY MY INFORMATION IS IS THAT

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:46.477
IT'S SORT OF THOSE THOSE.

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:47.778
THOSE REQUESTS OF SORT OF BEEN

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:49.513
IGNORED BY THE DB ARE BECAUSE

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.348
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS.

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:53.350
AUTHORITY TO GO FOR HIS COULD

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:54.518

QUESTION ABOUT A REQUEST FOR

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:59.723
AUTO RENEWAL I THINK I'LL DEFER

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:00.424
TO JOEL LEDESMA --

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.359
THE HEAD OF THE STATE WATER

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:04.027
PROJECT.

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:07.598
OKAY OR STEVE.

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:09.266
GOOD MORNING STEVE COLIN WITH

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:10.067
THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:11.735
RESOURCES.

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.470
THE CONTRACTS A SEVENTY FIVE

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:14.938
YEAR LONG CONTRACTS THAT WERE

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.940
ENTERED INTO IN THE EARLY

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:19.176
NINETEEN SIXTIES HAD A PROVISION

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:21.145
IN THERE WE CALL IT AN EVERGREEN

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:22.479
PROVISION.

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:25.082
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE CONTRACTORS

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:27.184
AND NOTICE TO THE DEPARTMENT AT

00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:29.253

CONTRACTS EXPIRE. TO HAVE THOSE

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:34.358
CONTRACTS RENEWED ON THE SAME

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:36.527
COST SPACES THE SAME WATER

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:39.196
QUALITY THE SAME DELIVERY.

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:40.731
SO SENATOR I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THE

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:21.104
THINKING IS.

00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:23.774
IT'S NICE TO GET IN A SENSE

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.044
INDIVIDUAL REQUESTS FOR RENEWAL.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.613

THOSE NOTICES THAT THEY WOULD

00:47:48.632 --> 00:47:49.967
LIKE TO RENEW.

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:51.501
THEY WERE PART OF THE TWENTY

00:47:51.568 --> 00:47:52.502
NINE CONTRACTORS WHO

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:55.339
PARTICIPATED IN THESE --

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:58.041
IN THESE PUBLIC NEGOTIATIONS AND

00:47:58.108 --> 00:48:00.077
HAVE SIGNED THE AGREEMENT IN

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:02.379
PRINCIPLE WHICH IS WHAT RESULTED

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:05.315
FROM THOSE NEGOTIATIONS.

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:08.452
SO WHAT'S YOUR OPINION THEN TO

00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:09.886
ANYONE OF YOU ON THE PANELS.

00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:12.756
THAT BY NOT ALLOWING A LONGER

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:14.791
WINDOW FOR WATER AGENCIES TO

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:18.061
PLAN AND RENEW ESPECIALLY SINCE

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:19.363
WHEN THESE PROJECTS WERE STARTED

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:20.697
IT WAS SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AND

00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:23.600
NOW WE'RE DOWN --

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:24.735
TO SEVENTEEN AND MOST OF THEM

00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:27.037
HAVE GROWN MULTIPLE IN MULTIPLES

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:29.006
MUCH MUCH BIGGER THAN THEY WERE

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:29.740
WHEN THEY STARTED [inaudible]

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.475
THAT.

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:33.010
PERHAPS YOU'RE ACTUALLY

00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:36.079
ENDANGERING THE FISCAL STABILITY

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:38.315
OF THE PROJECTS.

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:41.218
MORE AS THEN BY.

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.853
LIKE BY NOT HAVING THIS HEARING

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:44.121
THAN BY HAVING THIS HEARING

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:45.756
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:47.424
THE THINGS THAT DOCTOR PAM

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:48.659
BROUGHT UP WAS.

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:50.227
IT WHAT IS THIS FINANCIAL

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:51.695
STABILITY IF YOU KNOW OF THE

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:54.031
STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AND WHAT

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:55.465
EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE.

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:58.635
THAT THEY'RE GOING WELL AND IF

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.904
YOU CONSULT WITH THE HISTORY

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.639
JACK'S --

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:04.574
HOW THE FINANCIAL?

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.476
STABILITY WAS BASED WAS REALLY

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:08.078
PRETTY STRONG --

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:10.614
BUT THAT WAS BASED ON A SEVENTY

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:11.882
FIVE YEAR CONTRACT AND THE

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:14.284
ABILITY FOR THEM. TO BE ABLE TO

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:17.321
PLAN THEIR OWN RESERVES BECAUSE

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:18.922
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE THE

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.724
WATER RATE PAYERS PROPERTY RATES

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.792
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.

00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:24.828
YEAH SO WHAT THE WHAT IFS ABOVE

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:26.196
WE DO NOTHING.

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:26.830
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS HEARING

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:27.898
TODAY.

00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:30.467
WOULD BE BE ENDANGERING THE

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:31.835
PROJECT MORE OR LESS.

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.403
I'D I'D ALL RESPOND TO THAT SO

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.705
WE WOULD BE ENDANGERING THE

00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:37.074
PROJECT MORE IT'S SIMPLY PUT --

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.675
IT WITHOUT THE HEARING TODAY IT

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:39.876
WOULD REALLY CHALLENGE THE

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:42.145
AFFORDABILITY OF KNOWN PROJECTS

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:43.513
THAT.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.516
WE NEED TO START BONDING FOR SO

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:48.118
THAT WE CAN GET THEM ONLINE.

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:49.853
AND CONTINUE TO TO RUN AND

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.388
OPERATE THE EXISTING SYSTEM

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:52.489
WITHOUT THE HEARING TODAY

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:54.624
ULTIMATELY THAT BECOMES LESS AND

00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:56.360
LESS AFFORDABLE TO OUR STATE

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:57.627
WATER CONTRACTORS.

00:49:57.694 --> 00:49:59.296
MANY OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:00.630
LOCAL PROJECTS WHICH ARE VERY

00:50:00.697 --> 00:50:02.432
IMPORTANT AND THOSE ARE PROJECTS

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:03.333
THAT.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.835
ARE MEANT TO INTEGRATE INTO

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:06.436
THEIR STATE WATER PROJECT'S

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:07.904
SUPPLIES SO.

00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:11.041
YOU KNOW I THINK --

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:12.642
VERY IMPORTANT AND IT'S IT'S

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:14.044
VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS KIND

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:17.114
OF DIALOGUE WITH THE LEGISLATURE.

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.181
AND I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL TO

00:50:18.248 --> 00:50:19.783
THE NOT ONLY THE PHYSICAL

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.118
INTEGRITY OF THE STATE WATER

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.285
PROJECT THAT IS.

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:24.254
MAINTAINING ITS AFFORDABILITY

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:27.190
BUT ALSO THE WATER SECURITY OF

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:28.658
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:31.294
SO THEN I WOULD [inaudible]

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:33.397
PERHAPS.

00:50:33.463 --> 00:50:34.931
READ INTO THIS.

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:36.666
THAT THE SECOND PART LIKE IF WE

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:39.236
GO FORWARD JUST AS WE ARE AND WE

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:40.937
WE ALLOW THIS HEARING TO ALLOW

00:50:41.004 --> 00:50:42.272
BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR THE STATE

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:43.874
WATER CONTRACTS WHICH BY THE WAY

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:44.908
FRANKLY SOME OF THE SEA WATER

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:46.643
CONTRACTORS FEEL THE NEED TO BE

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.844
OURS SOMEWHAT LIKE.

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:50.013
THE P. YOU SEE INDICATING RATES

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.115
TO THEM IT'S NOT REALLY THAT

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:54.484
PRIVATE PEOPLE COME UP WITH HOW

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.319
MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO DO BUT

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:57.454
REALLY WHAT THAT.

00:50:57.521 --> 00:50:58.755
THE THE POOL COSTS WILL

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:01.658
ULTIMATELY BE IF THEY WANT TO

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.059
CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE.

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:05.162
IT IS THE NEW WATER FIX KEYS

00:51:05.228 --> 00:51:06.730
THAT PERHAPS WOULD BE THE

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:08.098
OVERSIGHT PEACE.

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:09.966
IF THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE GOING

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:12.002
TO CONTINUE TO SPEND ITS TIME

00:51:12.068 --> 00:51:14.905
MOST WISELY AND THE OVERSIGHT

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:16.206
DOLLARS MOST WIDELY.

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:18.008
WHICH WOULD THEN BE IN ANOTHER

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.811
CONTRACT HOWEVER WE ARE ALLOWING

00:51:20.877 --> 00:51:22.612

BEN AND HOW THOSE OF RATES

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:10.947
ACTUALLY AFFECT THEIR RATE

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:12.482
PAYERS AND THAT'S TYPICALLY A

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:13.883
MIX OF NOT ONLY STATE WATER

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.118
PROJECT CHARGES.

00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:17.721

00:54:21.124 --> 00:54:23.827
COST INCREASE TO BE PASSED ALONG.

00:54:23.893 --> 00:54:24.327

WATER FIX.

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:32.736
CLEARLY WHAT YOU DESCRIBED.

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:34.971

WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE WATER

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:46.282
FIX NEGOTIATIONS IN TERMS OF

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:47.651

00:54:49.285 --> 00:54:51.688
INPUT INTO THAT PROCESS.

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:57.127

FOR ANY CONTRACTS THAT ARE

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:01.097
NEGOTIATED ON THE WATER FIX.

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:03.299
SO THE PUBLIC PROCESS ASSOCIATED

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:05.835
WITH THE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS ON

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:06.770
THE ONE THAT WE USE FOR THE

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:08.304
WATER FIX AMENDMENT IS THE SAME

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:09.639
ONE THAT WE USE FOR THE CONTRACT

00:55:09.706 --> 00:55:11.474
EXTENSIONS WE ARE OBLIGATED TO

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:12.942
HOLD THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:13.843
PUBLIC.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.178
THEY BEGAN --

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:18.281

WE HAVE A DRAFT AGREEMENT IN

00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:23.620
PRINCIPLE THAT IS THE THE

00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:27.223
DOCUMENT BY WHICH OUR OUR

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:28.224
ATTORNEYS START --

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:32.629
TO RIGHT AND AND THEN THAT --

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.731
ALSO GOES THROUGH ITS OWN --

00:55:34.798 --> 00:55:36.633
SEQUEL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW --

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.435
WHICH IS A PROCESS THAT IS JUST

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:39.936
UNDER WAY I THINK WE HAVE A

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:41.838
NOTICE OF DETERMINATION AS OF

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:45.208
MAYBE A MONTH AGO --

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:46.342
THOSE AS I MENTION THOSE

00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:47.677
NEGOTIATIONS --

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.479
WERE HELD WITH PUBLIC NOTICE WE

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:51.347
DID GET SOME FEEDBACK --

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:53.817
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS NOT

00:55:53.883 --> 00:55:56.086
AWARE OF THAT AND WE CAN

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:58.054
CERTAINLY IN THE FUTURE --

00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:59.489
MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURES

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:00.724
RECEIVING THOSE KINDS OF

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:02.225
NOTIFICATIONS --

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:03.760
BUT THAT'S HE TIMELINE FOR THE

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:05.495
THOUGH WATER FIX AMENDMENT WE

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:07.464
WOULDN'T EXPECT IT --

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:10.533
TO BE COMPLETED UNTIL THAT THE

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.868
VERY END OF THIS YEAR.

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:13.436
SO THAT'S ELPFUL BUT WHAT I

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:15.138
HEAR IN THERE IS THAT WHILE WE

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:17.407
MIGHT RECEIVE SOME NOTICE.

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:19.109
THERE IS NO LET JUST DIRECT

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:21.177
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT RELATED TO

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:23.680
THOSE NEGOTIATED AMENDMENTS ON

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:25.281
THE WATER FIX.

00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:26.349
CORRECT THERE IS NOT THE

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:27.884
LEGISLATIVE THE INFORMATIONAL

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.122
EXTENSION.

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:35.892
SO WHAT WHAT ARE THE PATHWAYS.

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:38.528
FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHTOF THE

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:39.929
WATER FIX IN THOSE NEGOTIATED

00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:42.065

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:44.534
WELL YOU KNOW I WOULD DEFER TO

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:45.635
THE THE LA --

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:46.903
I MEAN THAT.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:49.739
OVERSIGHT IS I THINK --

00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:51.074
YOU KNOW THE THE PURVIEW OF THIS

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.575
BODY IF YOU WILL --

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:55.078
AND WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OF

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:58.314
BRINGING THAT INFORMATION --

00:56:58.381 --> 00:56:59.616
TO IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:01.284
CONTRACT AMENDMENTS BUT YOU KNOW

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:02.619
I WOULD FRANKLY DEFER TO THE

00:57:02.685 --> 00:57:04.454
LEGISLATIVE BODY ABOUT --

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:05.355
HOW?

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:08.191
DO YOU WOULD WANT TO EXERCISE --

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:10.360
SOME DEGREE OF OF OVERSIGHT OVER

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.295
THOSE THAT AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.097
THANK YOU MAYBE COULD I JUST.

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:14.798
TURNED TO THE LA --

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:17.000
AND GET YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.802
QUESTION YEAH I THINK THERE IS

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:22.105
NO STATUTORY REQUIREMENT.

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.406
FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ON

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:24.841
THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW.

00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:27.143
AND SO I THINK --

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:28.878
HAS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED IT IS

00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:33.950
YOUR BEER PER VIDEO --

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:35.051
TO TO EXERCISE THE OVERSIGHT

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.119
THAT YOU FEEL IS APPROPRIATE

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:38.054
EITHER BY REQUESTING THAT THEY

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:40.623
COME IN HAVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:40.790
IN.

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.292
AND PRESENT --

00:57:42.358 --> 00:57:44.561
OR IF THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:45.595
YOU FEEL THAT IT NEEDS TO BE

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:48.231
STATUTORY OR MORE RIGOROUS THAN

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:50.099
TO TAKE ACTION TO IMPLEMENT SOME

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:50.466
OF THAT.

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:53.336
SO THAT IS A POTENTIAL PATHWAY --

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:55.405
WE DID CONVENE AN OVERSIGHT

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:57.207

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:59.142

AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING.

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.545
BUT WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:03.279
THAT.

00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:08.017
A PATH TO EXPLORE COULD BE --

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:09.953
RIGHT AT THE CHECK IN AS THE

00:58:10.019 --> 00:58:11.254
CHAIR MENTIONED THERE WAS A

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:12.755
PROPOSAL FROM MISTER BLOOM AND

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:15.592
THAT DIDN'T AND ULTIMATELY MOVER

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:16.559
GET ENACTED THAT WOULD HAVE

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:18.761
REQUIRED SOME NOTIFICATION TO

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:21.130
THE JAIL BC AND SOME DELAY.

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:22.999
BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE A FACT

00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:25.134
AND TELL THEM THE WC HAD

00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:25.802
REVIEWED IT.

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.370
SO -- WHILE

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:29.439
THAT BILL DIDN'T PASS AND AND

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.307
AND COULD BE RESURRECTED IN THE

00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:32.742
FUTURE --

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.510

HAS INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:37.513
WORK WITH YOU AND SO YOU COULD

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.215

THEN IF THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:58:42.218 --> 00:58:42.919

THAT WE WILL NOT BE USING THE

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.291
CONTRACT AMENDMENTS THERE BEFORE

01:14:22.357 --> 01:14:24.092
US TO FINANCE.

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.794
THE WATER FIX INCLUDING FLOATING

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:28.997
BONDS RIGHT SO.

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:30.432
THE THREE PART ANSWER AND YOU

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:37.940
THE CONTRACT AMENDMENT BEFORE

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.641
YOU TODAY.

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:42.544
EXTENDS THE CONTRACTS WHICH

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:44.646
ENABLES THE DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:48.016
BONDS OVER THE LONG TERM.

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:51.119
WATER FIX IS A PROJECT IN WHICH

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:52.688
WE DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:54.723
AMENDMENT IN PLACE YET.

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.992
THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DO SO SO

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:59.728
WHEN THAT AMENDMENT IS COMPLETED.

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:02.064
THAT AMENDMENT WHICH STIPULATES

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.298
HOW WE WOULD CHARGE OUR

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:06.335
CUSTOMERS WOULD ESSENTIALLY TAKE

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:10.172
ADVANTAGE OF THIS EXTENSION.

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:11.406

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:20.549

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.765
PART OF THIS AMENDMENT THAT

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:39.268
ESTABLISHES A DIALOGUE WITH OUR

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.169
WATER CONTRACTORS. TO DESCRIBE

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:43.805
THE CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT WOULD

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:45.540
BE FUNDED --

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:46.808
OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT.

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:48.977
SEVERAL DECADES.

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.729
WE CAN DO THINGS WITHOUT LOSS

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:09.331

LINES IN THE DELTA WOULD HELP

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:14.549
THE HEALTH OF THE DELTA.

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:15.750
BUT WE'VE XCELERATED THIS

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.453

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:35.403
I DON'T KNOW WHAT FACTORS HAVE

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:36.871
BEEN TAKEN FROM YOUR YOUR

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.006
EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE OR

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:39.808
WHATEVER AND AND WHO SITS ON

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.443
THAT IS IT AGENCY PEOPLE OR IS

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:43.011
IT PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY HAVE

01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:43.645
VALUE.

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:45.046
STAKEHOLDERS THAT ACTUALLY CAN

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:46.314
WEIGH IN.

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:48.183
OR IS IT JUST A RUBBER STAMP

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:48.883
LIKE.

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:51.653
MOST AGENCIES DO HAVE.

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:53.455
AN INTERNAL --

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:55.123
BUT YOU KNOW JUST GENTLY BECAUSE

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:55.723
THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING THROUGH

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:58.159
THE PACES --

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:00.094
MY CONCERN IS IS THAT YOU HAVE

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:01.663
THE STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD.

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:03.932
THAT CAN ACTUALLY STOP ANY FLOAT

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:05.867
ANY PROJECT.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:07.635
AND ACCELERATE THROUGH PUT

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:09.304
THROUGH THE DELTA [inaudible]

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:12.006
ONE DETERMINATION --

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:12.841
WHICH WOULD COMPLETELY.

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:15.877
BLOW [inaudible]

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.613
YOUR ABILITY --

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.548
TO PAY FOR A DEBT SERVICE.

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:23.751
ON THE OTHER PROCESS IS.

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:25.353
YOU KNOW THERE'S A PROJECTION OF

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:26.754
A POSSIBLY OF AN EXTENDED

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:28.022
DROUGHT.

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:30.492
UP TO TEN YEARS.

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:32.427
SO YOU'RE CIRCUMVENTING THE

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:33.661
LOWER DELTA BY DOING IT OF A

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:35.263
WATER FIX.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.098
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:38.733
THE RATE PAYERS AND THEN

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.368
ULTIMATELY THE TAXPAYERS.

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:42.103
AND AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:43.238
ORVILLE.

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:44.973
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT WAS

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:47.075
RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:49.511
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SPILL WAY.

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.212
YET POOR.

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.448
CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES.

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:54.516
WHERE WHAT'S THE COST WHERE WE

01:25:54.582 --> 01:25:56.017
ARE NOW ON THAT PROJECT?

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:58.253
IS IT OVER BILLION.

01:25:58.319 --> 01:25:59.954
YES ONE POINT ONE BILLION.

01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:00.154
OKAY.

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.856
SO [inaudible]

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:03.424
SEEING THAT.

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:04.959
THAT ONE POINT ONE BILLION

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:06.494
DOLLARS COULD HAVE BEEN UTILIZED

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:07.495
FOR SO MANY OTHER PROJECTS HAVE

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:12.400
THE PROJECT AND DONE WELL --

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:15.537
I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:19.340
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TRUST.

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:22.143
BEING ABLE TO TRUST IS TO ME --

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.478
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU IN A LOT OF

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.914
OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE'VE

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:27.248
BEEN THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN

01:26:27.315 --> 01:26:29.250
JAMMED THIS SEEMS THIS WHOLE

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:32.954
PROCESS FOR CONTRACT EXTENSIONS.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.188
ABSOLUTELY IS BEING JAM.

01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:38.593
AND WHEN YOU HAVE SEVENTEEN

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.428
YEARS TO TO INCLUDE THE

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:42.730
LEGISLATURE INCLUDE THE PUBLIC.

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:45.300
I THINK THAT SERIOUSLY WE NEED

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:46.801
TO GO TO A PROCESS WHERE.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.436
THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPENDITURE

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:50.838
PLAN TO THE THE LEGISLATURE

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:53.474
NEEDS TO APPROVE --

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:54.509
WE'VE SEEN IT ON OTHER PROJECTS

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:56.411
YOU KNOW A MANAGER --

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:59.480
THAT.

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:00.982
WE'RE TAKING A GOOD FAITH THAT

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.350
THE YOU'RE JUST GONNA DO RIGHT

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:04.052
WELL WE HAVE A ONE POINT ONE

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:05.219
BILLION DOLLAR EXPENSE.

01:27:05.286 --> 01:27:07.121
NOW.

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:07.755
THAT.

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.824
WE HAD TRUST IN AN AGENCY AND

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:12.527
WASN'T DONE RIGHT.

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:14.929
SO I JUST.

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.531
I'M HOPING.

01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:19.100
THAT YOU CAN SLOW YOUR ROLL.

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:20.668
AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALL HAVE

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.870
CONCERNS AND THE PROBLEM IS IS

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:24.739
WE JUST WENT INTO RECESS AND NOT

01:27:24.806 --> 01:27:25.840
A LOT OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.109
WEIGH IN --

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:30.378
TO THIS COMPONENT BUT ANYTIME

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:32.747
THAT WE DO LEGISLATION. TO TWO

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:35.016
PART OF THIS PROCESS.

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:35.984
IT SEEMS TO NOT MAKE IT TO THE

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:39.587
GOVERNOR'S DESK.

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:41.522
SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU HAVE AN

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:44.292
OPPORTUNITY. TO BUILD THIS

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:44.759
RELATIONSHIP --

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:46.060
SOCIALLY TRIP BECAUSE THERE'S

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:48.329
THERE'S THERE'S A PART OF THE

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:49.731
PUBLIC IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:53.101
BET AGAIN D. W. OR I THINK THE

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:55.003
EXAMPLE IS TOUCH SLOUGH VERSES

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:55.903
FOR FIX.

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.171
YOU KNOW --

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:58.673
IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.309
DISHEARTENING THAT I SEE --

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:01.943
THAT WERE HERE AND I HAVE TO BE

THAT I WANTED TO PUSH ON AND

01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:33.574
THAT IS WITH REGARD TO WHETHER

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:35.009
THE AMENDMENT BEFORE US.

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:37.912
WOULD ALLOW FOR ANY FIND DOLLARS

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.747
TO GO TOWARD THE WATER FX

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:41.382
ITSELF -- I

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:43.584
I THINK RATHER THAN ASK IF YOU

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:45.586
WOULD BE WILLING I'D LIKE TO SEE

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:47.522
THE COMMITTEE REQUIRE THAT YOU

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:00.802
WISH THAT I WOULD HAVE

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.470
INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THIS LAST

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:04.472
YEAR TO REQUIRE THAT AND I WILL

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:05.807
DO SO NEXT YEAR.

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:07.608
I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPERATIVE

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:09.477
WE HAVE DONE THAT WITH OTHER --

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:12.180
MAKE A WATER PROJECTS PROJECTS

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.649
IN GENERAL HIGH SPEED RAIL IF

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:15.249
YOU WERE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:16.984
AUTHORITY YOU WOULD BE COMING

BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE

01:29:18.653 --> 01:29:19.921
BUSINESS PLAN YOU WOULD BE

01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:21.656
COMING AND MAKING A REQUEST FOR

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:23.057
DOLLARS TO BE USED.

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:26.461
EVEN KNOW YOUR CONTRACTS ARE

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:27.095
WITH -- WITH

01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:28.663
WATER DISTRICTS ANOTHER

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:31.499
PROVIDERS AND THE CONTRACTORS

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:33.468
WEEDS ARE STILL USING STATE

01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:35.603
DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT AS A

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:37.205
WHOLE AND WE'RE STILL

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:38.973
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROJECT AS A

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.274
WHOLE.

01:29:40.341 --> 01:29:41.476
AND THE SECOND THING THAT I'D

01:29:41.542 --> 01:29:42.944
LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOU

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:44.912
MENTIONED THE ASSET MANAGEMENT

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.547
PLAN CAN YOU TALK TO US MORE

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.216
ABOUT THAT AND WHAT THAT IS

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:50.618
EXACTLY IS AND AND HOW YOU

01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:53.287
INSURE WHAT THE DELIVERABLES ARE

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:54.388
IN THAT AND WHAT.

01:29:54.455 --> 01:29:56.557
WHAT THE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.760
WITH THOSE ACTUAL PROJECTS AND

01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:00.361
WHAT'S THAT LOOK LIKE BECAUSE

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:02.063
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK AS

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:05.466
MEMBERS WE SHOULD ALL SEE WE

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:07.301
SHOULD BE REVEALING THAT?

01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:08.603
SO -- THE

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:10.304
I'M I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO TO

01:30:10.371 --> 01:30:12.006
JOEL LEDESMA WHOSE --

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.875
MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS

01:30:13.941 --> 01:30:16.611
ON THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN BUT

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:18.546
YOU KNOW THE OVERARCHING MESSAGE

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:19.881
FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.149
WHICH IS TRUE OF A LOT OF OUR

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:22.583
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:25.153
ITS ITS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:30:25.219 --> 01:30:28.489
WATER IN PARTICULAR ALSO SUBJECT --

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:30.124
TO THE CHALLENGES OF A CHANGING

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:31.692
CLIMATE ON TOP OF THAT.

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:34.195
AGING INFRASTRUCTURE SO --

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:35.730
THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN IS A

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:37.131
DOCUMENT THAT'S BEEN UNDER

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.733
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE LAST COUPLE

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.768
OF YEARS --

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:42.970
AND IT WHAT IT IS CENTRALLY DOES

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:45.273
IS THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF THE

01:30:45.339 --> 01:30:46.774
STATE WATER PROJECT THAT ARE.

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:48.342
COMING TO THE CLOSE OF THEIR

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:50.511
USEFUL LIFE OR ARE IN NEED OF

01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:52.914
REPAIR AND AND REHABILITATION.

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.415
AND WE ARE VERY MUCH ENTERING

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:57.919
INTO AN ERA OF OF REINVESTMENT

01:30:57.985 --> 01:31:00.188
AND SOME OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:01.389
AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:02.790
THAT -- IN A

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:04.559
TRANSPARENT WAY AND WE HAVE A

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:06.127
LOT OF ABILITIES --

01:31:06.194 --> 01:31:07.295
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE WHEN THE

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:09.630
STATE WATER PROJECT WAS WAS

01:31:09.697 --> 01:31:11.399
ORIGINALLY ORIGINALLY BUILT.

01:31:11.465 --> 01:31:13.334
AND SO THE DEPARTMENT --

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.069
UNDER MY LEADERSHIP I THINK IS

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:16.070
GOING TO BECOME A LOT MORE

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:18.172
TRANSPARENT AS AN ORGANIZATION

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:19.574
NOT ONLY WITH THE PUBLIC WATER

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.943
AGENCIES WHO YOU KNOW.

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:38.025
WE

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:53.040
HAVE A LONG HISTORY WITH OUR

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:53.674
PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES AND THEY

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:54.308
HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS ABOUT WHAT

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:55.176
THE THINGS D. W. R. HAS DONE

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:55.910
WELL IN THE ONES WE HAVE NOT

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:56.244
DONE WELL --

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:57.211
AND THOSE FOLKS ARE ALSO VERY

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.079
MUCH ACCOUNTABLE IN AN ELECTED

01:31:58.145 --> 01:31:59.146
WAY TO THEIR RATE PAYERS.

01:31:59.213 --> 01:31:59.547
AND SO.

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:00.348
IT'S MY VIEW THAT THE MAGNITUDE

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:00.948
OF THE REINVESTMENT THAT IS

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:01.582
GOING TO BE REQUIRED --

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:02.283
TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR WATER

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.017
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:03.951
FUNCTIONING AND SUPPORTS NOT

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:04.619
ONLY THE ECONOMY BUT ALSO

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:05.553
SUPPORTS THE ECOSYSTEMS IN

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:12.727
CALIFORNIA ANNUAL BASIS AND

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:18.199
OPERATE RAJA ACT OUR WAYS IN

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:20.801
WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS --

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:22.803
HAS ALREADY WEIGHED IN --

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.639
AND AND NECESSARILY

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:26.407
INAPPROPRIATELY --

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.409
TO MAKE THE STATE WATER PROJECT

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:29.510
A LITTLE BIT MORE TRANSPARENT TO

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:31.612
THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND I THINK

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:32.380
THAT'S SOMETHING --

01:32:32.446 --> 01:32:34.382
I'D BE GLAD TO PURSUE AND I

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:36.250
THINK OUR STATE WATER

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:38.019
CONTRACTORS --

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:40.321
WOULD ALSO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:42.290
THAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY IN IN

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:44.325
AND PARTLY BECAUSE AGAIN THEY'RE

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:45.826
ALL ACCOUNTABLE TO CALIFORNIANS

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.261
IN THE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION RATE

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:48.496
PAYERS THAT --

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:49.530
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HAVE

01:32:49.597 --> 01:32:51.565
REINVEST IN OUR SYSTEM --

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:53.000
ON TO TURN IT OVER TO TO JEWEL

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:54.635
MORE SPECIFICALLY TO ANSWER YOUR

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:56.537
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ASSET

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:57.538
MANAGEMENT PLAN.

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:58.306
GOOD MORNING --

01:32:58.372 --> 01:32:59.740

THE DEPARTMENT IS YOU KNOW IN MY

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:05.179
VIEW IS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL.

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:06.447
OPERATION OF THE STATE WATER

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:09.083

THE FACILITIES WHEN SOME OF WHOM

01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:20.828
WERE VERY NEW AND KIND OF SEEN

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:23.164
THE AGING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:23.931
AS YOU WOULD SAY.

01:33:23.998 --> 01:33:26.434

COMMITMENT THAT WE NEEDED TO

HAVE A STRONGER ASSET MANAGEMENT

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:32.974
PROGRAM SO WE ALREADY HAD ONE

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.909
IT'S A COMMON UTILITY PRACTICE

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:36.043
TO HAVE AN ASSET MANAGEMENT

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:38.980
PROGRAM. TO MANAGE THE LIFE AND

01:33:40.681 --> 01:33:43.084
EFFICIENT LIFE OUT OF EVERY

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:44.385
ASSET WE OWN.

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:46.787
SO HE STARTED A NEW A NEW

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:48.789

US TO A HIGHER STANDARD OF ASSET

01:33:50.624 --> 01:33:52.093
MANAGEMENT SO WE'VE ADOPTED

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:55.096
WHAT'S CALLED ISEL FIFTY FIVE

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:55.629
THOUSAND ONE WHICH IS AN

INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR ASSET

01:33:58.332 --> 01:33:59.767
MANAGEMENT AROUND THE WORLD.

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:01.836
SO OUR GOAL FOR THE LAST FIVE

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:03.337
YEARS IN WEARING YEAR THREE HAS

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:05.706
BEEN LET'S UPDATE OUR PROGRAM SO

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:07.675
THAT INCORPORATES ALL ASSETS

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:09.744
WHETHER THE ROTATING EQUIPMENT

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.278
LIKE OUR PUMPS OR GENERATORS.

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:13.080
OR CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURES LIKE

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.682
OUR DAMS IN ACADEMICS AND

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:16.917
PIPELINES IN BRING THEM ALL IN

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:19.353
INTO ONE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM.

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.056
THAT CAN REALLY EVALUATE THE

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.791
CONDITION.

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:25.960
AND THE EXPECTANCY AND THE RISK

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:27.528
OF EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT SO

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:28.829
THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY MAKE

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:34.335
WHERE RELIABILITY IS MAINTAINED

01:34:34.402 --> 01:34:36.303
OR ENHANCE BUT ALSO TAKING INTO

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:38.072
ACCOUNT RISK INFORMED DECISION

01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:39.573
MAKING SO WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.708
PUBLIC?

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:42.910
OR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT RISK SO

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:44.945
WITH THIS NEW PROGRAM THAT'S

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.447
GOING TO EXTEND FIFTY YEARS OUT.

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:47.581
WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:50.718
CONDITION OF EVERY ASSET WE HAVE.

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:52.820
APPLY RISK TO IT WHETHER IT'S

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:57.558
RISK.

01:34:57.625 --> 01:35:00.327
AND PUT OUR DOLLARS WHERE WE ARE

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:02.730
THEIR BEST APPROPRIATE TO NOT

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:04.632
PUT ANY RISK ON THE PROJECT BUT

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:05.599
YET.

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:08.636
ALLOW THE AFFORDABILITY LIKE

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:10.571
WATER AGENCIES IN THE DEPARTMENT

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:11.639
TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE MONEY

01:35:11.705 --> 01:35:14.075
WHERE IT'S BEST FIT AND BE ABLE

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:15.009
TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE STATE

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:17.445
WATER PROJECT AND UPDATED AS AS

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.780
APPROPRIATE.

01:35:19.847 --> 01:35:21.782
SO IN THIS ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:24.752
IT EIGHT CONTAINS THEM ASSETS

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:26.554
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE DOES IT

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.922
HAVE THE ASSETS THAT ARE

01:35:27.988 --> 01:35:28.722
PROPOSED [inaudible]

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:31.225
NO.

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:32.693
IS THERE A PLAN TO HAVE THE

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.961
ASSETS AS OPPOSED.

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:36.797

CONSTRUCTED.

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.102
THEN THEY'RE PULLED INTO THE

01:35:41.168 --> 01:35:43.070
ASSET MANAGEMENT IT'S MORE OF A

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:44.872
MAINTENANCE PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:46.440
THAT WE'RE PROVIDING WERE DOING

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:47.908
THE RIGHT MAINTENANCE ON THE

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:49.210
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO GET THE

01:35:49.276 --> 01:35:50.744
LIFE THAT WE EXPECT AUTUMN S

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:53.180
THAT PROGRAM WOULD NOT HAVE

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:53.481
[inaudible]

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:55.649
FUTURE PROJECTS UNTIL THEY'RE

01:35:55.716 --> 01:35:57.218
CONSTRUCTED IN THEIR ACTUAL

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:58.486
ASSETS ON THE BOOKS.

01:35:58.552 --> 01:36:02.323
SO THERE IS NO MECHANISM. TO

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:04.091
BRING TO THE IN THAT THERE IS NO

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:05.559
VEHICLE TO BRING TO THE

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.094
LEGISLATURE PER SE.

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:08.162
THAT HAS --

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:11.398
AN OVERALL SUMMARY AND PLAN FOR

01:36:11.465 --> 01:36:13.367

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:15.069
FIX THAT IS PROPOSED.

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:16.871
BUT RATHER IT'S IN YOUR INNER

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:18.339
WORKINGS AND THERE'S NOT A

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:22.009
FORMALIZED PLAN THAT WE HAVE ANY

01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:24.078
ABILITY TO REVIEW.

DESALINATION.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.422
RECYCLED WATER THAT'S THE PLACE

I MUST SAY THAT IT IS OF SOME

01:37:43.057 --> 01:37:44.525
CONCERN TO ME THAT.

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:46.393
THIS IS OCCURRING AFTER THE

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:49.630
LEGISLATURE HAS ADJOURNED --

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:50.764

THE MONTHS SINCE HER APPOINTMENT.

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:03.611
AND IT APPEARS TO ME SHE'S VERY

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:06.347
SINCERE ABOUT REACHING OUT.

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:08.015
AND INJURING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:09.383
AND TRANSPARENCY WITHIN THE

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:11.418

VERY ROOM SAY THAT THERE IS NO

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:17.992
TRUST IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.226
ZERO AND IN THE AREA THAT I

01:38:19.293 --> 01:38:20.894
REPRESENT IT'S DOUBLE.

01:38:20.961 --> 01:38:22.129
ZERO BECAUSE OF OUR BILL

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:22.429
[inaudible]

01:38:22.496 --> 01:38:25.266
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SO FOR THE

01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:26.600
DEPARTMENT MAKING A GOOD FAITH

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:29.236
FAITH EFFORT TO TO WORK WITH US

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:30.671
AND YOU DID WORK GO WITH

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:32.039
ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER AND I ON

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:34.108
SOME DAMN INSPECTION LEGISLATION

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:35.175
LAST YEAR.

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:36.944
AND ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK RIGHT

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:39.713
NOW IS ANOTHER MAJOR TO ALLOW

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.548
COMMUNITY INPUT.

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:43.717
A NOT DIRECTLY IN VOTING AND

01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:45.586
DOESN'T HAVE POWERS BUT IT DOES

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:47.121
HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET AND BE

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:48.589
INFORMED.

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:51.191
AND TO INFORM THE DEPARTMENT SO

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:52.092
THAT'S MOVING IN THE RIGHT

01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:52.793
DIRECTION.

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.495
I WOULD ITERATE FROM MY OWN

01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:56.497
PERSPECTIVE THAT INDEED THERE IS

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:59.600
A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT WATER FIX.

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:01.769
AND WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO.

01:39:01.835 --> 01:39:03.437
AND WHAT ITS FUTURE IN FACT WILL

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:05.372
BE.

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:07.775
pWHAT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THOUGH?

01:39:07.841 --> 01:39:09.977
THERE MUST BE.

01:39:10.044 --> 01:39:12.379
VERY STRICT LEGISLATIVE

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:13.647
OVERSIGHT OF EVERYTHING THAT IS

01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:16.583
DONE.

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.218
THE OVERRUNS ON OR REAL RIGHT

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:19.753
NOW FRANKLY ARE OF GREAT CONCERN

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:21.889
TO ME.

01:39:21.955 --> 01:39:23.190
NOW I KNOW WHAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:39:23.257 --> 01:39:25.225
IS SAID ABOUT.

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:28.495
THOSE OVER RUNS AND WHY.

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:30.364
BUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:30.664
[inaudible]

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:32.366
JUSTIFICATIONS.

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:34.401
OUR PRESENT DAY ARE THE PRODUCT

01:39:34.468 --> 01:39:37.638
OF FIFTY YEARS OF NEGLECT.

01:39:37.705 --> 01:39:38.605
AND THE GREATEST NEGLECT WAS THE

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:43.644
LACK OF BORING OR UNDERGROUND.

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:46.213
EXPLORATION AS TO WHAT WAS GOING

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.081
ON UNDERNEATH THE SPELL WORKS

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:49.316
[inaudible] FOR DECADES.

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:51.752
N. INATTENTION TO FIXING.

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:53.187
THOSE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:55.389
EXPLODED INTO THIS NEAR DISASTER

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:57.491
THAT WE JUST EXPERIENCED.

01:39:57.558 --> 01:39:58.826
THAT THEN EMPHASIZES THE POINT

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:01.595
THAT ON I SAY ALL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:03.197
IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS MUCH MORE

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:04.264
SCRUTINY.

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:05.232
AND MANAGEMENT BY THE

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:07.601

DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

01:40:12.005 --> 01:40:13.974
MOST ASSUREDLY DO.

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:16.243
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE

01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:17.745
NOT ONLY IS THE FIXING IF YOU

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:19.079
WILL.

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:21.215
OF THE DAM [inaudible]

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:23.517
ORVILLE DAMN.

BY PASSES THAT CONVEY.

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:35.863
AND IN FACT THE DELTA ITSELF.

01:40:35.929 --> 01:40:37.498
WHICH BY THE WAY THEY THROUGH

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:40.501
DELTA FACILITY IS A POSSIBILITY.

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:42.503
THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE.

01:40:42.569 --> 01:40:44.338
BY THE RED TUNNEL.

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:46.106
OR CAN NOW.

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.341

THAT IN MIND.

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:51.311

A HIGHER DEGREE OF OF COST

01:45:40.934 --> 01:45:43.003
UNCERTAINTY AND THAT'S WHY THE

01:49:27.594 --> 01:49:29.596
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE STATE

01:49:29.663 --> 01:49:31.164
WATER CONTRACTORS.

01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:32.866
SOUTH OF THE DELTA AND THAT

01:49:32.933 --> 01:49:34.868
WOULD ENTAIL A SIGNIFICANT

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:38.038
AMOUNT OF OF DISCUSSION AND AND

01:49:38.104 --> 01:49:40.573
LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS TO TO ENABLE

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:43.209
THAT INVESTMENT TO HAPPEN.

01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:46.246
AND AS YOU ACCOUNT FOR THIS.

01:49:46.313 --> 01:49:48.248
YOU MENTIONED CERTAIN CRITERIA

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:50.717
IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA HUMAN.

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:53.386
USE OF WATER.

01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:55.655
WHICH BE DAGGER CULTURAL USE

01:49:55.722 --> 01:49:58.591
DOMESTIC INDUSTRIAL USE OF WATER.

01:49:58.658 --> 01:50:00.727
WHILE I WOULD ANTICIPATE --

01:50:00.794 --> 01:50:02.195
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT SAID AND THAT

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:03.930
IS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:05.532
THERE'S THE HUMAN WATER RIGHT IN

01:50:05.598 --> 01:50:07.467
CALIFORNIA RIGHT SO SO WHAT I

01:50:07.534 --> 01:50:10.203
WAS REFERRING TO SIR WAS THE THE

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:11.771
SPECIFIC PUBLIC BENEFITS.

01:50:11.838 --> 01:50:15.342
ALL THE STORAGE PROJECTS --

01:50:15.408 --> 01:50:16.309
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BUILDING

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:19.746
BE BUILT THAT WOULD HAVE A A

01:50:19.813 --> 01:50:21.414
LOCAL FINANCING COMPONENT SOME

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:22.515
OF THEM COULD HAVE A FEDERAL

01:50:22.582 --> 01:50:24.050
FUNDING COMPONENT.

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:28.288
AND THOSE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE --

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:30.323
NEEDS AND GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:32.559
THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO PROVIDING

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:34.627
CLEAN WATER TO TO FARMS IN

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:36.363
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:38.298
AND TO WHAT DEGREE.

01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:40.734
ARE YOU GUIDED BY THE TWO

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.736
THOUSAND AND NINE LEGISLATION.

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:44.738
THE CAPE BROUGHT FORTH THE NEW

01:50:44.804 --> 01:50:46.539
WATER PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA YOU

01:50:46.606 --> 01:50:47.474
MENTION THE WATER PLANT AWHILE

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:49.709
AGO IS THAT THE WATER PLAN

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.778
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UPDATING.

01:50:51.845 --> 01:50:54.047
I KNOW THAT WAS A SEPARATE UNDER

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:56.916
THE WATER CODE AND CALIFORNIA'S

01:50:56.983 --> 01:50:58.852
D. W. R. AS REQUIRED TO PUT A

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:01.221
PLAN TOGETHER EVERY FIVE YEARS.

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:03.089
SO OUR LAST ONE WOULD HAVE COME

01:51:03.156 --> 01:51:04.824
OUT IN --

01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:06.159
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THIS IS THE

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:07.727
FIVE YEAR UPDATE OF THAT OF THAT

01:51:07.794 --> 01:51:09.429
WATER PLANT I SEE.

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:11.097
THOUGH DO YOU FEEL.

01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:13.133
GUIDE INDEED REQUIRED TO BE

01:51:13.199 --> 01:51:16.403
GUIDED BY AN AD HERE.

01:51:16.469 --> 01:51:18.571
TO THE WATER PLANT OF NINE

01:51:18.638 --> 01:51:19.406
THOUGH THE FOUND FINDINGS AND

01:51:19.472 --> 01:51:21.474
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THAT WATER

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:22.675
PLAN OF NINE IS THAT GOING TO BE

01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:24.444
ALSO RECTOR MAC MOST CERTAINLY

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:26.212
YES OKAY THANK.

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:27.947
YOU I I DID A QUICK QUESTION FOR

01:51:28.014 --> 01:51:28.848
THE LEDGE ANALYSTS.

01:51:28.915 --> 01:51:32.852
ANALYSTS DO YOU BELIEVE THE

01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:34.721
YOU'RE SO FAR AND I'VE.

01:51:34.788 --> 01:51:36.189
REVIEWED YOUR DOCUMENTS.

01:51:36.256 --> 01:51:37.257
CARDS ARE THERE ENOUGH

01:51:37.323 --> 01:51:37.557
[inaudible]

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:39.325
CONTROLS.

01:51:39.392 --> 01:51:40.960
OF THE LEGISLATURE.

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:43.363
AS WE PROCEED FORWARD.

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:46.232
EXPANDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:51:46.299 --> 01:51:48.001
HOURS ARE GOING TO BE OUT OF THE

01:51:48.068 --> 01:51:49.335
CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE.

01:51:49.402 --> 01:51:50.770
ARE ACTUALLY I THINK WE HAVE

01:51:50.837 --> 01:51:53.139
LONG RECOMMENDED --

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:54.741
THAT AN IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:55.708
ROLE FOR OVERSIGHT OVER THE

01:51:55.775 --> 01:51:56.943
STATE WATER PROJECT WHETHER

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.144
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONS TO

01:51:58.211 --> 01:51:59.245
THE STATE WATER PROJECT OR

01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:01.714
EXISTING ONE EXAMPLE WE

01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:02.282
DISCUSSED EARLIER AS WE'VE

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:02.715
RECOMMENDED.

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:04.284
I BRING THE PROJECT ON BUDGET

01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:05.385
RATHER THAN HAVING THE FUNDING

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:07.020
BE CONTINUOUSLY PERFORATED SO

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:07.954
THAT THERE'S AN ANNUAL CHECK IN

01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:09.355
THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:13.560
PROCESS ON EXPENDITURES AND AND

01:52:13.626 --> 01:52:15.495
FUNDING SO THAT'S ONE AVENUE BUT

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:17.864
CERTAINLY GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:19.365
NOT ONLY THE DOLLARS IN THEIR

01:52:19.432 --> 01:52:20.834
PUBLIC DOLLARS COMING.

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.135
FROM THE PUBLIC THROUGH PUBLIC

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:23.670
WATER AGENCIES BEING SPENT BUT

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:25.305
ALSO THE IMPORTANCE TO THE

01:52:25.371 --> 01:52:27.073
VITALITY OF CALIFORNIA THE WATER

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:30.443
THAT -- IT'S-IMPORTANT THAT THAT YOU ALL AS

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:32.145
AN ELECTED BODY HAVE SUFFICIENT

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:33.847
OVERSIGHT AND SO LOOKING FOR

01:52:33.913 --> 01:52:35.348
AVENUES TO INCREASE THAT WE

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:36.749
THINK IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:37.951
YOU'VE STILL THAT ROUTE.

01:52:38.017 --> 01:52:39.085
WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

01:52:39.152 --> 01:52:40.487
LEGISLATION OR DO YOU THINK THE

01:52:40.553 --> 01:52:42.455
LEGISLATURE IS NOW SUFFICIENTLY

01:52:42.522 --> 01:52:43.857
WITH IT'S POWERS.

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:48.561
EMPOWERED. TO EXERCISE CERTAINLY

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:49.896
YOU HAVE.

01:52:49.963 --> 01:52:51.865
RIGHT A BIT OF OF OPPORTUNITY

01:52:51.931 --> 01:52:53.032
THROUGH OVERSIGHT HEARINGS THAT

01:52:53.099 --> 01:52:54.901
YOU COULD EXERCISE MORE GREATLY

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:56.669
THAN YOU CURRENTLY DO BUT I'M AT

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:57.637
THINGS LIKE CHANGING THE

01:52:57.704 --> 01:52:59.973
BUDGETARY PRACTICES OR REQUIRING

01:53:00.039 --> 01:53:02.041
CERTAIN REPORTS COMING TO YOU

01:53:02.108 --> 01:53:03.710
WOULD REQUIRE STATUTORY CHANGES.

01:53:03.776 --> 01:53:05.345
AND WE STILL HAVE SOME CONTROL

01:53:05.411 --> 01:53:07.480
OVER THE BUDGET ITSELF DO WE NOT.

01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:09.349
THROUGH POSITIONS THAT'S REALLY

01:53:09.415 --> 01:53:11.017
THE THE PEACE THAT COMES BEFORE

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:12.285
YOU EACH YEAR IS HOW MANY IF

01:53:12.352 --> 01:53:13.419
THEY ARE REQUESTING NEW

01:53:13.486 --> 01:53:15.221
POSITIONS OF STATE EMPLOYEES

01:53:15.288 --> 01:53:17.457
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE NEXUS

01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:17.790
OF THIS POINT.

01:53:17.857 --> 01:53:19.025
LOOK WHAT.

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:20.660
LET LET LET ME GET TO SOMETHING

01:53:20.727 --> 01:53:22.428
MORE SPECIFIC I MENTIONED AWHILE

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:26.166
AGO GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE

01:53:26.232 --> 01:53:28.134
COSTS OF WAR WILL HAVE EXPLODED.

01:53:28.201 --> 01:53:29.669
NOW I UNDERSTAND PART OF THE

01:53:29.736 --> 01:53:31.037
REASON FOR THE FAILURES F THE

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:32.605
LAST FIFTY YEARS IN THERE HAPPEN

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:34.374
TO MAKE UP FOR THAT.

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.309
AND WHATEVER YOU DO NOW IS ON A

01:53:36.376 --> 01:53:38.511
NEW BASIS AND WITH NEW STANDARDS

01:53:38.578 --> 01:53:38.811
[inaudible]

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:42.549
BUT DO WE HAVE AN ABILITY.

01:53:42.615 --> 01:53:45.018
TO PREVENT SUCH THINGS AS WHAT

01:53:45.084 --> 01:53:46.619
HAPPENED OR WILL HE END THIS

01:53:46.686 --> 01:53:47.954
OVER RUN THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:50.423
RIGHT NOW. FOR THAT THAT FROM

01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:51.925
HAPPENING GOING FORWARD.

01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:53.026
YEAH AND I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE

01:53:53.092 --> 01:53:54.460
CLARIFIED YOU DO HAVE A LARGE

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:55.862
PIECE OF DATA WE OURS BUDGET

YOU'RE JUST NOT THE STATE WATER

01:53:57.997 --> 01:53:59.132
PROJECT THAT'S THE PIECE THAT'S

01:53:59.199 --> 01:53:59.999
CONTINUOUSLY PURPOSE OF THEIR

01:54:00.066 --> 01:54:01.568
DAMN INSPECTIONS BUDGET AND

01:54:01.634 --> 01:54:02.735
THERE WAS ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:54:02.802 --> 01:54:04.671
PROVIDED AND AND REQUIREMENTS.

01:54:04.737 --> 01:54:06.005
I GUESS ACTUALLY SOME FUNDING

01:54:06.072 --> 01:54:07.473
AND ALSO AUTHORITY --

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:08.808
TO CHARGE DAM OWNERS ADDITIONAL

FEES TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR WORK

02:03:11.417 --> 02:03:12.952
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.

02:03:13.018 --> 02:03:14.687

TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED OVER THE

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:11.470
PAST YEARS IT CETERA.

02:10:11.537 --> 02:10:13.572
BUT I DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW

02:10:13.639 --> 02:10:16.241
THERE IS THIS GOES BACK PARENTS

02:10:16.308 --> 02:10:18.310
SEE -- AND

02:10:20.679 --> 02:10:23.348
THAT.

02:10:23.415 --> 02:10:25.017
THAT THEIR SIDE THAT THAT TRUST

02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:26.985
IS BUILT AND I THINK THAT --

02:10:27.052 --> 02:10:28.453
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING ABOUT

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:30.189

02:10:33.725 --> 02:10:34.826
LONG YOU ARE MAKING GO OUT

02:10:34.893 --> 02:10:36.094
BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S

02:10:36.161 --> 02:10:38.030
BASICALLY YOU CAN'T DIVE DOWN

02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:39.498
AND YOU'RE DOING STUFF AND THEN

02:10:39.565 --> 02:10:41.567
YOU POP UP EVERY YOU KNOW COUPLE

02:10:41.633 --> 02:10:43.202

KNOW THEIR PROPERTY IT CETERA.

02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:53.178
AND THAT AND THAT --

02:10:53.245 --> 02:10:54.947
PEOPLE WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT --

02:10:55.013 --> 02:10:55.414
IT'S ALL TOO LATE --

02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:56.682
TO WHAT WE SIGNED ALL THE

02:10:56.748 --> 02:10:57.950

COMMITMENTS WE FOLLOW THE BONDS

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:01.220
THAT CREATES A LOT OF DISTRUST

02:11:01.286 --> 02:11:02.721
SO -- I

02:11:02.788 --> 02:11:03.822
APPRECIATE THAT --

02:11:03.889 --> 02:11:05.224
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO ALLOW

02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:07.025

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:08.527
I APPRECIATE DIRECTORS COULD --

02:11:08.594 --> 02:11:10.128
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID I THINK

02:11:10.195 --> 02:11:13.432
AGAIN WHAT TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE

02:11:13.498 --> 02:11:14.466
YOU'RE RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS IS WE

DON'T SIT THERE AND MICRO MANAGE

02:11:16.268 --> 02:11:18.403
EVERY LITTLE EXPENDITURE RIGHT

02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:19.304
AND THAT IT'S BETTER.

02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:20.772
BUT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT IF

02:11:20.839 --> 02:11:22.874
SOMETHING IS OUT OF THE NORM OF

02:11:22.941 --> 02:11:24.343
FEATURE NORMAL OPERATIONS ARE

02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:25.944
NORMAL CAPITAL.

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:27.412
AND THAT'S GONNA START AFFECTING

02:11:27.479 --> 02:11:28.880
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE'RE

02:11:28.947 --> 02:11:29.748

SIMPLE AS FOREIGN.

02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:19.711
AND SOME OF YOUR IT REFERRED TO

02:15:19.778 --> 02:15:20.979
IT AND I'VE BEEN VERY ENCOURAGED

02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:25.650
BY WHAT YOU'VE HEARD.

02:15:25.717 --> 02:15:26.485
AND THAT IS QUITE SIMPLY.

02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:27.652
THIS NEEDS TO BE THE BEGINNING

02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:29.120
NOT THE END OF THE LEGISLATIVE

02:15:29.187 --> 02:15:30.956
OVERSIGHT AND THAT REFERS TO

02:15:31.022 --> 02:15:33.124
BOTH SETS OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

02:15:33.191 --> 02:15:35.527

WHICH ACTUALLY INCLUDE MORE.

02:15:38.964 --> 02:15:40.899
AND THE LEADERS SET OF WATER

02:15:40.966 --> 02:15:43.134
SUPPLY BEAMED ONES FOCUSED ON

02:15:43.201 --> 02:15:44.536
WATER FIX.

02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:46.571
OVERSIGHT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:48.573
ON BOTH MATTERS AND YES THEY ARE

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.208
INTER RELATED.

02:15:50.275 --> 02:15:52.744
ON I AM A SOCCER DAD AND I'M

02:15:52.811 --> 02:15:54.379

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:55.814
PRETTY SIMPLE POINT HERE.

WATER FIX PART OF IT --

02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:06.324
I WOULD DESCRIBE.

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:10.328

CONTRACT.

02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:27.913
IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT IT WOULD

02:16:27.979 --> 02:16:29.915
BE THE LEGAL EQUIVALENT OF AN

02:16:29.981 --> 02:16:33.318
OWN GOAL IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE.

02:16:33.385 --> 02:16:35.921
THE TIMING THE THE SENSE OF

02:16:35.987 --> 02:16:37.923
URGENCY THAT D. W. ARE AND SOME

02:16:37.989 --> 02:16:39.391
OF THE CONTRACTORS HAVE BROUGHT

SOME EARLIER SCOPING COMMENTS

02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:20.098
BUT NOT THOSE.

02:17:20.165 --> 02:17:22.500
WHY IF THERE IS SUCH A RUSH IS

02:17:22.567 --> 02:17:27.439
GW ARE TAKEN SO LONG? TO RESPOND --

02:17:27.505 --> 02:17:28.573

THE THE COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT

02:17:32.744 --> 02:17:35.747
DIR WERE NOT SIMPLY GARDEN

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:39.351
VARIETY YOU KNOW ARE ARE ALL THE

02:17:39.417 --> 02:17:40.619
DOTS --

02:17:40.685 --> 02:17:43.588
DOTTED AND SO FORTH KINDS OF

02:17:43.655 --> 02:17:46.124
OBJECTIONS ON SANTA BARBARA

02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:49.060
COUNTY OFFICIALS ASKED IN TWENTY

02:17:49.127 --> 02:17:50.428
FOURTEEN FOR A SPECIFIC ANALYSIS

02:17:50.495 --> 02:17:52.364
OF WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD

02:17:52.430 --> 02:17:53.999
BE OF THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT

02:17:54.065 --> 02:17:55.967
SPECIFICALLY FOR TAXPAYERS AND

02:17:56.034 --> 02:17:56.868
RATEPAYERS.

02:17:56.935 --> 02:17:59.204
WHETHER WERE VOTED THE PEOPLE

02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:01.306
WOULD BE REQUIRED --

02:18:01.373 --> 02:18:02.574
TIONAL PROVISIONS ARE THEY

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:03.875
COVERED OR THEY'RE NOT THAT

02:18:03.942 --> 02:18:06.444
ANALYSIS HAS NEVER BEEN PROVIDED.

02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:08.680
VIEWED IMPLEMENTS COUNTIES WERE

02:18:08.747 --> 02:18:09.948
CONCERNED THAT.

02:18:10.015 --> 02:18:12.217
EVEN IF OTHER APPROVALS WERE

02:18:12.283 --> 02:18:13.952
REQUIRED IT'S BEEN HAS BEEN

02:18:14.019 --> 02:18:15.453
DISCUSSED HERE --

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.155
THE EXTENSION AMENDMENTS BY

02:18:17.222 --> 02:18:18.523
PLANE INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN

02:18:18.590 --> 02:18:20.458
FACILITATING THE WATER FIX

02:18:20.525 --> 02:18:22.360
PROJECT THEY WERE TOLD IT TURNS

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:24.829
OUT INCORRECTLY THAT WATER FIX

02:18:24.896 --> 02:18:26.865
WOULD ONLY BE ADDRESSED IN THE

02:18:26.931 --> 02:18:29.034
SECOND SET OF AMENDMENTS --

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:30.869
AND WE HAVE WE HAVE HEARD MORE

02:18:30.935 --> 02:18:31.836
ABOUT THAT.

02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:34.172
THAT TODAY IT IS VERY

02:18:34.239 --> 02:18:36.775
UNFORTUNATE THE D. W. R. HAS SAT

02:18:36.841 --> 02:18:38.410
ON THOSE COMMENTS FOR SO LONG

02:18:38.476 --> 02:18:40.712
BECAUSE IT THE DAY IT WOULD BE

02:18:40.779 --> 02:18:42.981
THE LINK BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF

02:18:43.048 --> 02:18:44.749
AMENMENTS AND THE REASON WHY

02:18:44.816 --> 02:18:46.418
THERE IS AN INDISPENSABLE STEP

02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:48.620
ON THE EXTENSION PARK FOR WATER

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:50.088
FIX SPECIFICALLY.

02:18:50.155 --> 02:18:52.390
WOULD BE SO MUCH CLEARER IF

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:54.225
THOSE COMMENTS HAD BEEN ADDRESS.

02:18:54.292 --> 02:18:55.727
THE REASON IT MATTERS UNDER

02:18:55.794 --> 02:18:57.729
WATER COOLED ONE FORTY SEVEN

02:18:57.796 --> 02:18:59.631
POINT FIVE IS THAT D. W. WARS

02:18:59.698 --> 02:19:01.700
OBLIGATION IS TO PROVIDE THE

02:19:01.766 --> 02:19:03.835
DETAILED TERMS AND CONDITIONS

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:08.039
THAT WOULD SERVE AS THE TEMPLATE.

02:19:08.106 --> 02:19:08.873
FOR THE OTHER CONTRACTS.

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.041
IF THIS WERE TREATED AS THE

02:19:10.108 --> 02:19:11.643
FINAL HEARING IT WOULD BE ON THE

02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:13.344
COLLISION COURSE WITH THE SEQUEL

02:19:13.411 --> 02:19:15.013
PROCESS WHICH MUST BE

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:16.381
INTERACTIVE AND ALLOW FOR

02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:18.550
CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO PROJECT

02:19:18.616 --> 02:19:19.918
MODIFICATION INTACT.

02:19:19.984 --> 02:19:21.453
RELYING ON THIS IS THE HEARING

02:19:21.519 --> 02:19:23.822
WOULD CREATE KIND OF OF A

02:19:23.888 --> 02:19:26.057
PERVERSE DISINCENTIVE TO MAKE

02:19:26.124 --> 02:19:27.926
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROJECT THAT

02:19:27.992 --> 02:19:30.128
MIGHT IMPOSE LESS ENVIRONMENTAL

02:19:30.195 --> 02:19:31.763
AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:34.065
IN RESPONSE TO THAT PUBLIC

02:19:34.132 --> 02:19:35.066
CRITICISM.

02:19:35.133 --> 02:19:36.735
SO -- THE

02:19:36.801 --> 02:19:38.503
REASON WHY I CALLED IT AN OWN

02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:40.004
GOAL IS THAT THERE'S NO GOOD

02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:41.506
REASON THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE

02:19:41.573 --> 02:19:43.641
FINAL HEARING D. W. R. AS

02:19:43.708 --> 02:19:45.777
CONCEDED IN ITS MATERIALS THAT

02:19:45.844 --> 02:19:46.978
IT IS.

02:19:47.045 --> 02:19:49.180
IT CAN NOT ACTUALLY EXECUTE

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:50.515
EITHER SET OF CONTRACT

02:19:50.582 --> 02:19:51.416
AMENDMENTS INCLUDING THE

02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:53.785
EXTENSION AMENDMENTS UNTIL IT

02:19:53.852 --> 02:19:55.954
COMPLETES ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:58.957
AT LEAST ON THAT STAT --

02:19:59.023 --> 02:20:02.160
SO THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT TO

02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:04.395
COME BACK AND I WOULD SAY ONCE

02:20:04.462 --> 02:20:05.997
BOTH THE INTER RELATED SETS OF

02:20:06.064 --> 02:20:07.365
AMENDMENTS.

02:20:07.432 --> 02:20:09.100
ARE TOGETHER AND WE KNOW MUCH

02:20:09.167 --> 02:20:11.202
MORE ABOUT WHERE THIS PROCESS IS

02:20:11.269 --> 02:20:13.204
GOING AND AS IT'S BEEN CORRECTLY

02:20:13.271 --> 02:20:14.305
NOTED.

02:20:14.372 --> 02:20:15.774
THIS MORNING.

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:18.510
THE COMMITTEE HAS THE DISCRETION

02:20:18.576 --> 02:20:20.011
TO IMPOSE OTHER KINDS OF

02:20:20.078 --> 02:20:21.479
OVERSIGHT AND PERHAPS

02:20:21.546 --> 02:20:23.681
LEGISLATION SHOULD BE IN ORDER

02:20:23.748 --> 02:20:24.215
AS WELL.

02:20:24.282 --> 02:20:24.983
BOMB.

02:20:25.049 --> 02:20:27.118
OF THERE ARE OTHER REQUIREMENTS

02:20:27.185 --> 02:20:28.686
BESIDE SICK WITH THE NEED TO BE

02:20:28.753 --> 02:20:30.655
MANAGED WELL THE DELTA COUNTIES

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:32.557
COALITION IS CORRECTLY POINTED

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:33.992
OUT THAT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

02:20:34.058 --> 02:20:35.727
ANOTHER REQUIRED ANALYSES

02:20:35.794 --> 02:20:38.163
UNDERWATER CODE.

02:20:38.229 --> 02:20:39.464
ONE FORTY SEVEN HAD NEVER BEEN

02:20:39.531 --> 02:20:41.432
PROVIDED AND THEY ALSO POINTED

02:20:41.499 --> 02:20:43.468
OUT I THINK QUITE CORRECTLY THAT

02:20:43.535 --> 02:20:45.136
IT WOULD BE A CLASSIC PIECE

02:20:45.203 --> 02:20:48.907
MEALING ERROR. TO BOMB TO FAIL

02:20:48.973 --> 02:20:50.275
TO CONSIDER THE INTERPLAY

02:20:50.341 --> 02:20:52.510
BETWEEN THESE TWO VERY RELATED

02:20:52.577 --> 02:20:54.379
SETS OF CONTRACT AMENDMENTS ONE

02:20:54.445 --> 02:20:56.414
AND THE EXTENSION ON AND THE

02:20:56.481 --> 02:20:57.849
OTHER ON WATER SUPPLY.

02:20:57.916 --> 02:20:59.818
AMENDMENTS IN SOME THERE IS NO

02:20:59.884 --> 02:21:01.286
DOWNSIDE TO BRINGING THE

02:21:01.352 --> 02:21:03.087
DEPARTMENT BACK HERE THEY CANNOT

02:21:03.154 --> 02:21:04.756
LAWFULLY FINALLY EXECUTE THE

02:21:04.823 --> 02:21:06.991
AMENDMENTS UNTIL THEY COMPLETE

02:21:07.058 --> 02:21:09.460
THAT PROCESS WHICH MAY GENERATE

02:21:09.527 --> 02:21:10.929
A WHOLE LOT MORE LIGHT.

02:21:10.995 --> 02:21:12.297
THAN THOSE SUPERFICIAL

02:21:12.363 --> 02:21:14.199
DISCUSSION OF THESE SUBJECTS WE

02:21:14.265 --> 02:21:15.900
HAVE SOMETIMES HEARD.

02:21:15.967 --> 02:21:18.236
THIS MORNING --

02:21:18.303 --> 02:21:20.171
WITH RESPECT TO THE FORTHCOMING

02:21:20.238 --> 02:21:22.574
PROCESS ON THE WATER SUPPLY

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:24.309
CONTRACT AMENDMENTS ONE

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:26.110
CORRECTION OF I THINK THE

02:21:26.177 --> 02:21:27.946
DEPARTMENT AT ONE POINT REFERRED

02:21:28.012 --> 02:21:29.948
TO A NOTICE OF DETERMINATION

02:21:30.014 --> 02:21:31.449
ISSUING.

02:21:31.516 --> 02:21:34.519
IN IN FACT THAT WAS A NOTICE OF

02:21:34.586 --> 02:21:37.689
PREPARATION.

02:21:37.755 --> 02:21:39.657
THERE IS MUCH MORE TO BE DONE.

02:21:39.724 --> 02:21:41.492
THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO

02:21:41.559 --> 02:21:42.961
RAISE TODAY.

02:21:43.027 --> 02:21:44.195
IS THAT I THINK YOU HAVE

02:21:44.262 --> 02:21:46.264
ACTUALLY HEARD CONFIRMATION

02:21:46.331 --> 02:21:49.133
BEFORE THE PANEL THAT CONTRARY

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:50.301
TO WHAT WOULD SOMEONE PUT IT

02:21:50.368 --> 02:21:51.936
SOMETIMES SAID BEFORE THIS

02:21:52.003 --> 02:21:53.171
HEARING.

02:21:53.238 --> 02:21:55.173
THE ELEPHANT REALLY IS IN THE

02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:55.974
ROOM.

02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:58.176
THE EXTENSION.

02:21:58.243 --> 02:22:00.411
SEPARATELY AND EVEN IN ADVANCE

02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:01.479
OF THE WORK --

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:03.147
SO CALLED WATER SUPPLY --

02:22:03.214 --> 02:22:05.083
WATER FIX CONTRACT AMENDMENTS

02:22:05.149 --> 02:22:07.986
WOULD TAKE AN INDISPENSABLE STEP

02:22:08.052 --> 02:22:10.622
TO MAKE POSSIBLE REVENUE BONDS

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.190
FOR WATER FIX THAT OTHERWISE

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:14.459
WOULD NOT BE LAWFULLY ALLOWED

02:22:14.525 --> 02:22:16.127
UNDER THE STATE WATER PROJECT --

02:22:16.194 --> 02:22:19.497
CONTRACTS I AM QUITE GRATEFUL.

02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:22.333
TO MS EHLERS OF FOUR CANDIDLY

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.335
SAYING I THINK QUITE CORRECTLY

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:25.570
THAT WALL OF COURSE OTHER

02:22:25.637 --> 02:22:27.238
APPROVALS ARE INVOLVED IN THE

02:22:27.305 --> 02:22:29.707
WATER FIX PROCESS --

02:22:29.774 --> 02:22:31.175
IT -- BUT

02:22:31.242 --> 02:22:32.710
THE CONTRACT EXTENSION

02:22:32.777 --> 02:22:35.346
AMENDMENTS IN THEMSELVES WOULD I

02:22:35.413 --> 02:22:35.580
THINK --

02:22:35.647 --> 02:22:37.081
FREEZE WAS PERFECT AND

02:22:37.148 --> 02:22:39.984
FACILITATE WATER PHIPPS THE LACK

02:22:40.051 --> 02:22:43.488
OF CANDOR THAT WE FRANKLY HEARD

02:22:43.554 --> 02:22:45.857
FROM THE DEPARTMENT TODAY

02:22:45.924 --> 02:22:50.094
QUESTION CLEARLY AND AND

02:22:50.161 --> 02:22:51.529
THROWING IN MORE FOG OF

02:22:51.596 --> 02:22:52.797
COMPLEXITY.

02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:55.199
I THINK IT SHOWS THE WISDOM OF

02:22:55.266 --> 02:22:56.467
THE APPROACH THAT THE L. A. L.

02:22:56.534 --> 02:22:59.070
HAS LONG ADVOCATED SUGGESTING A

02:22:59.137 --> 02:23:01.339
MORE RIGOROUS KIND OF OVERSIGHT

02:23:01.406 --> 02:23:03.007
OVER D. W. R. PERHAPS BRINGING

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:04.509
IT ON TO THE BUDGET BUT

02:23:04.575 --> 02:23:06.711
CERTAINLY MAKING SURE.

02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:09.414
THAT THEY THAT THAT NEED EITHER

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:10.949
SET OF AMENDMENTS WILL NOT

02:23:11.015 --> 02:23:12.984
PROCEED BASED AND BLIND FAITH

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:15.019
THAT THEY ARE SERVING THE PUBLIC

02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:17.255
WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL BUT WE

02:23:17.322 --> 02:23:19.624
WILL BRING OUT THEIR BEST BY

02:23:19.691 --> 02:23:22.193
INSURING OVERSIGHT --

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:23.895
THE CONTRACT EXTENSION

02:23:23.962 --> 02:23:25.697
AMENDMENTS ARE UNFORTUNATELY

02:23:25.763 --> 02:23:28.066
QUITE MISNAMED BECAUSE WHILE IT

02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:29.767
IS CERTAINLY THE CASE AND IT IS

02:23:29.834 --> 02:23:32.036
A BIG DEAL IN ITSELF THAT THERE

02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:33.838
IS A PROPOSED FIFTY YEAR --

02:23:33.905 --> 02:23:36.474
EXTENSION OF THE CONTRACT TERMS

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:39.143
pTHIS IS A BIGGER.

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:41.346
THERE IS AND IT IS IN FACT A

02:23:41.412 --> 02:23:43.948
MAJOR REDEFINITION AN EXPANSION

02:23:44.015 --> 02:23:45.984
OF WHAT COUNTS FOR REVENUE BOND

02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:48.553
PURPOSES AS STATE OF AS AS

02:23:48.619 --> 02:23:50.888
FACILITIES --

02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:51.889
THAT -- THAT

02:23:51.956 --> 02:23:54.492
WOULD IMPOSE ENORMOUS NEW RISKS

02:23:54.559 --> 02:23:57.595
AND COSTS ON THE PROJECT WORSE

02:23:57.662 --> 02:23:59.130
IS WHAT SOME EDITORIAL WRITERS

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:01.132
OF KIND OF CORRECTLY ANALOGIZE

02:24:01.199 --> 02:24:04.802
TO A TIME MACHINE --

02:24:04.869 --> 02:24:07.005
NOT IF IF OF WATER FIX AND

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:08.673
PERHAPS OTHER BIG PROJECTS IN

02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:09.474
THE FUTURE.

02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:11.809
BECOME COVER PROJECTS THEY WILL

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:13.411
BE TREATED AS IF THEY WERE PART

02:24:13.478 --> 02:24:15.213
OF THE ORIGINAL PROJECT LIKE THE

02:24:15.279 --> 02:24:18.316
PRE EIGHTY SEVEN FACILITIES --

02:24:18.383 --> 02:24:20.218
WHICH ALSO RAISES A GRAVE

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:22.520
CONCERN ABOUT CIRCUMVENTION OF

02:24:22.587 --> 02:24:23.054
THAT --

02:24:23.121 --> 02:24:25.690
CONSTITUTIONAL TAX PROVISIONS.

02:24:25.757 --> 02:24:26.758
THAT.

02:24:26.824 --> 02:24:30.595
THAT ARE NOW IN PLACE THAT.

02:24:30.661 --> 02:24:31.729
THEY WERE THERE ARE MAJOR RISKS

02:24:31.796 --> 02:24:33.264
FOR REPAIRS AND TAXPAYERS THAT

02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:34.799
HAVE NOT.

02:24:34.866 --> 02:24:37.001
BEEN ADDRESSED --

02:24:37.068 --> 02:24:39.137
THE FACT ISTHAT --

02:24:39.203 --> 02:24:41.672
BE EXTENSION AMENDMENTS

02:24:41.739 --> 02:24:43.141
THEMSELVES ARE.

02:24:43.207 --> 02:24:46.077
INDISPENSABLE FOR REVENUE BONDS

02:24:46.144 --> 02:24:48.513
TO BE IMPOSED FOR BEFORE WATER

02:24:48.579 --> 02:24:50.148
FIX -- THE

02:24:50.214 --> 02:24:53.051
URGENCY FRANKLY IS BECAUSE D. W.

02:24:53.117 --> 02:24:55.253
R. BY TRYING TO CREATE THE

02:24:55.319 --> 02:24:57.655
IMPRESSION OF MOMENTUM ON THE

02:24:57.722 --> 02:25:00.191
FOUNDERING WATER FIX PROJECT.

02:25:00.258 --> 02:25:02.093
PUT ITSELF IN A BOX BY MOVING

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:04.495
AHEAD TOO FAST ON TWO THINGS IT

02:25:04.562 --> 02:25:06.831
HAS A PENDING APPLICATION FOR

02:25:06.898 --> 02:25:08.933
FEDERAL FUNDING --

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.135
THAT AS SOON AS A FIFTY YEAR

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:13.104
TIME FRAME --

02:25:13.171 --> 02:25:14.872
ALSO --

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:16.541
JUMPED THE GUN AND WENT TO COURT

02:25:16.607 --> 02:25:19.343
LAST JULY TO VALIDATE REVENUE

02:25:19.410 --> 02:25:21.212
BOND RESOLUTIONS --

02:25:21.279 --> 02:25:22.780
FOR WATER FIX IT AS SOON THAT

02:25:22.847 --> 02:25:26.017
THEY CAN BE PAID BACK TO TWENTY

02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:27.585
EIGHTY FIVE AND COVER FACILITIES

02:25:27.652 --> 02:25:30.321
THAT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED UNDER

02:25:30.388 --> 02:25:31.222
THE CURRENT CONTRACTS.

02:25:31.289 --> 02:25:33.491
THE CONTRACTS THEMSELVES THOUGH

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:35.059
ARE NOT --

02:25:35.126 --> 02:25:36.227
ARE ARE NOT SOUGHT FOR

02:25:36.294 --> 02:25:38.162
VALIDATION ONE OF THE ISSUES

02:25:38.229 --> 02:25:39.764
THAT WILL HAVE TO BE DETERMINED

02:25:39.831 --> 02:25:41.666
THERE IS OUR BELIEF THAT THAT

02:25:41.732 --> 02:25:43.701
THE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:25:43.768 --> 02:25:45.403
ATTEMPTING AN END RUN AROUND

02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:46.838
THIS VERY.

02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:48.773
THIS VERY PROCESS.

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:50.908
YOU HAVE HEARD A FEW THINGS HERE

02:25:50.975 --> 02:25:52.877
TODAY --

02:25:52.944 --> 02:25:55.279
THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DEFLECT

02:25:55.346 --> 02:26:00.518
ATTENTION FROM THE CLEAR NEED.

02:26:00.585 --> 02:26:01.719
TO AMEND.

02:26:01.786 --> 02:26:02.620
THROUGH THESE SO CALLED

02:26:02.687 --> 02:26:05.123
EXTENSION PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT

02:26:05.189 --> 02:26:06.691
WATER FIX WILL BE COVERED BUT

02:26:06.757 --> 02:26:08.526
FOR REVENUE BONDS --

02:26:08.593 --> 02:26:12.096
ONE IS REFERRED TO IN THE

02:26:12.163 --> 02:26:13.498
BACKGROUND.

02:26:13.564 --> 02:26:15.633
MEMO -- FOR

02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:19.971
THIS HEARING IT'S ON PAGE THREE

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:21.939
THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT

02:26:22.006 --> 02:26:23.574
ARTICLE ONE EIGHTY OF THE

02:26:23.641 --> 02:26:25.143
EXISTING CONTRACTS WHICH DEFINES

02:26:25.209 --> 02:26:27.845
WATERFORD SYSTEM FACILITIES FOR

02:26:27.912 --> 02:26:29.113
WHICH REVENUE BONDS MAY BE SOLD.

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:31.949
ALREADY AUTHORIZES THE SALE OF

02:26:32.016 --> 02:26:34.619
BONDS TO FINANCE CONSTRUCTION OF

02:26:34.685 --> 02:26:36.053
WATER FIXED FACILITIES.

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:37.822
ARTICLE ONE EIGHTY IF YOU LOOK

02:26:37.889 --> 02:26:40.358
THROUGH THE CURRENT CONTRACTS

02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:42.093
DOES NOT EXIST.

02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:43.928
WATER RESISTANT FACILITIES ARE

02:26:43.995 --> 02:26:47.532
DEFINED IN ARTICLE ONE H. H. AND

02:26:47.598 --> 02:26:49.200
FRANKLY THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS

02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:50.768
WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT CLEARER IF

02:26:50.835 --> 02:26:52.870
YOU W. R. HADN'T BURIED AND NOT

02:26:52.937 --> 02:26:55.806
CONFRONTED THOSE COMMENTS ON THE

02:26:55.873 --> 02:26:58.142
CONTRACT EXTENSION DRAFT ER.

02:26:58.209 --> 02:26:59.210
ALTHOUGH WE'VE HEARD A

02:26:59.277 --> 02:27:01.579
SUGGESTION FROM ITS PRIOR THIS

02:27:01.646 --> 02:27:04.549
MORNING I BELIEVE THAT THAT --

02:27:04.615 --> 02:27:05.917
THAT.

02:27:05.983 --> 02:27:08.319
ARTICLE ONE H. H. HAS NOTHING TO

02:27:08.386 --> 02:27:09.587
DO WITH ALL OF THIS.

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:10.888
BK OR AT LEAST IT DOESN'T

02:27:10.955 --> 02:27:12.590
ADDRESS THE FINANCING --

02:27:12.657 --> 02:27:14.859
ALLOCATION I THINK THE PHRASE

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:16.260
WAS AS WELL OF WATER FAVES.

02:27:16.327 --> 02:27:17.695
THE PAPER TRAIL.

02:27:17.762 --> 02:27:20.565
THAT IS PROVIDED IN THE PUBLIC

02:27:20.631 --> 02:27:22.066
COMMENTS STILL ON A DRESS

02:27:22.133 --> 02:27:24.735
DIRECTLY DISPROVES THAT --

02:27:24.802 --> 02:27:27.405
THE COMMENTS OF OF THE PLANNING

02:27:27.471 --> 02:27:28.906
AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE AND UP.

02:27:28.973 --> 02:27:29.807
BUNCH OF OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

02:27:29.874 --> 02:27:34.212
GROUPS SAY ON ON THE DRAFT AGAIN

02:27:34.278 --> 02:27:36.080
GO WAY BEYOND THE GARDEN MORE

02:27:36.147 --> 02:27:37.782
WITH THE GARDEN VARIETY THEY

02:27:37.848 --> 02:27:39.517
ACTUALLY READ IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:27:39.584 --> 02:27:41.652
ATTACHED DOCUMENTS FROM SOME OF

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:42.987
THE WORLD'S LEADING FINANCIAL

02:27:43.054 --> 02:27:44.655
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

02:27:44.722 --> 02:27:47.225
THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE A MIGHT A

02:27:47.291 --> 02:27:48.759
SMALLER OR WELL.

02:27:48.826 --> 02:27:51.062
WATER RETOOLING OF THE BIG SHORT

02:27:51.128 --> 02:27:54.098
BOMB THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:27:54.165 --> 02:27:55.466
CONCERNS.

02:27:55.533 --> 02:27:57.268
THAT THE SO CALLED EXTENSION

02:27:57.335 --> 02:27:59.870
AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY BUNDLED IN

02:27:59.937 --> 02:28:02.073
MAJOR NEWS SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND

02:28:02.139 --> 02:28:04.308
COSTS UNDER THE MISLEADING

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:06.811
RUBRIC OF AN EXTENSION.

02:28:06.877 --> 02:28:10.114
BOMB SO ONE OF THE EXHIBITS THAT

02:28:10.181 --> 02:28:12.016
I REFERRED TO IN MY LETTER WAS

02:28:12.083 --> 02:28:14.051
AN ANALYSIS BY STAPLE THAT HAD

02:28:14.118 --> 02:28:15.019
THIS QUOTE.

02:28:15.086 --> 02:28:17.722
PWRS LEGAL COUNSEL HAS CONCLUDED

02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:20.258
THAT BBC P. THE PREDECESSOR TO

02:28:20.324 --> 02:28:21.826
THE CURRENT WATER FIX PROJECT IS

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:23.995
NOT ON THE LIST OF APPROVED

02:28:24.061 --> 02:28:25.730
PROJECTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:28:25.796 --> 02:28:29.433
FUNDING INCLUDING THROUGH BOND

02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:30.534
FINANCING.

02:28:30.601 --> 02:28:31.235
IF THESE PUBLIC COMMENTS HAD

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:32.503
BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY THEY WOULD

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:34.772
HAVE SHOWED THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:28:34.839 --> 02:28:36.974
WAS ACTUALLY QUITE CONCERNED

02:28:37.041 --> 02:28:38.175
ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF

02:28:38.242 --> 02:28:40.378
FACILITIES AND KNEW.

02:28:40.444 --> 02:28:41.912
THAT IN ADDITION TO EXTENDING

02:28:41.979 --> 02:28:43.748
THE CONTRACT LENGTH --

02:28:43.814 --> 02:28:46.250
DEFINITION OF FACILITIES WE NEED

02:28:46.317 --> 02:28:47.918
TO BE CHANGED AND EXPANDED IN

02:28:47.985 --> 02:28:54.091
ORDER TO CUT COVER REVENUE BONDS --

02:28:54.158 --> 02:28:55.259
FOUR WATER CHECKS --

02:28:55.326 --> 02:28:56.360
SO THAT --

02:28:56.427 --> 02:28:58.996
THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW IT HAS

02:28:59.063 --> 02:29:00.498
DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH THE

02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:02.033
POOLS OF WATER FIX IT IS IT IS

02:29:02.099 --> 02:29:04.702
NOT THE POINT THE POINT IS THAT

02:29:04.769 --> 02:29:06.037
THEY HAD TO CHANGE THAT

02:29:06.103 --> 02:29:07.838
PROVISION --

02:29:07.905 --> 02:29:09.740
IN ORDER TO DO OTHERWISE THE

02:29:09.807 --> 02:29:11.542
OTHER SUGGESTION FOR MS MAN AT

02:29:11.609 --> 02:29:13.177
THIS MORNING THAT YOU HEARD WAS

02:29:13.244 --> 02:29:14.812
THAT THAT IT COULD BE A COVERED

02:29:14.879 --> 02:29:16.580
FACILITY BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT

02:29:16.647 --> 02:29:20.484
ON AN ONGOING BASIS --

02:29:20.551 --> 02:29:22.153
IT SAYS WHAT IT THINGS WATER

02:29:22.219 --> 02:29:24.322
SYSTEM FACILITY SHOULD BE AND

02:29:24.388 --> 02:29:27.525
DID SO WITH RESPECT TO WATER FIX.

02:29:27.591 --> 02:29:32.763
ON THEIR ATTENDS A BAT DOCUMENTS

02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:34.231
ASSOCIATE WITH THE WATER FIX

02:29:34.298 --> 02:29:36.300
PROJECT BUT YOU ONLY NEED TO

02:29:36.367 --> 02:29:38.135
LOOK AT TWO PAGES --

02:29:38.202 --> 02:29:39.804
TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT THERE IS

02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:41.272
AN ORDER CALL PROJECT ORDER

02:29:41.339 --> 02:29:44.642
NUMBER FORTY ON IT THAT WAS NOT

02:29:44.709 --> 02:29:46.811
PART OF THE SEQUEL PROCESS OR

02:29:46.877 --> 02:29:49.080
THE CONTRACT EXTENSION PROCESS.

02:29:49.146 --> 02:29:51.482
BUT WAS RELIED ON IN THE

02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:54.218
DEPARTMENT'S REVENUE BONDS. FOR

02:29:54.285 --> 02:29:56.687
WATER FIX AND THIS.

02:29:56.754 --> 02:29:58.956
UNACCOUNTABLE ON REVIEW DOCUMENT

02:29:59.023 --> 02:30:00.991
IN A COUPLE OF PARAGRAPHS

02:30:01.058 --> 02:30:03.828
ATTEMPTED TO SUMMARILY REDEFINED

02:30:03.894 --> 02:30:04.695
ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL

02:30:04.762 --> 02:30:05.563
ISSUES.

02:30:05.629 --> 02:30:06.697
IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE

02:30:06.764 --> 02:30:08.599
WATER PROJECT WHETHER SOME KIND

02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:11.102

02:30:57.915 --> 02:30:59.283
PROJECT SO.

02:30:59.350 --> 02:31:01.318
THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T RELY ON

02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:02.820
THIS PHANTOM AUTHORITY THAT IT

02:31:02.887 --> 02:31:04.555

THE GAME HERE.

02:31:08.893 --> 02:31:12.062
IS THAT DATE JUMP THE GUN AND

02:31:12.129 --> 02:31:14.064

HAVE TO PAY ON A POTENTIAL BLANK

02:31:21.972 --> 02:31:23.674
CHECK FOR WATER FIXED COSTS

02:31:23.741 --> 02:31:26.577
WITHOUT BEING CANDID ABOUT WHAT

02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:27.445
THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING.

02:31:27.511 --> 02:31:29.613
IT IS IN COMMON ON THIS.

02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:32.082
COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:31:32.149 --> 02:31:33.717

IS AS VIGOROUS IN NEED AS IT

02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:39.290
NEEDS TO BE IN THIS SITUATION --

02:31:39.356 --> 02:31:41.292
THE NEXT POINT THAT IS RELATED

02:31:41.358 --> 02:31:42.626
TO THIS ONE I WANT TO RAISE

02:31:42.693 --> 02:31:43.928

TO WRAP UP I CAN BE VERY BRIEF

02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:54.171
FOR THE REST I APPRECIATE THAT

HOLIDAYS FOR THAT THAT'S OKAY

02:31:55.673 --> 02:31:57.107
AND TO COVER WHAT A BUNCH OF

02:31:57.174 --> 02:31:59.243
SPEAKERS UPSET AND I APPRECIATE

02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:01.111
THE OPPORTUNITY --

02:32:01.178 --> 02:32:03.681
THE COMPRESSION ARGUMENT IS

02:32:03.747 --> 02:32:05.549
FRANKLY A RED HERRING.

02:32:05.616 --> 02:32:07.651
IF YOU LOOK AT THE A CONTRACT

02:32:07.718 --> 02:32:10.020
THE CHART THAT THE OF THE STATE

02:32:10.087 --> 02:32:11.522

METROPOLITAN REFERRED.

02:32:15.025 --> 02:32:17.761
TO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT

02:32:17.828 --> 02:32:20.764
V. CONTRACT EXTENSION AMENDMENTS

02:32:20.831 --> 02:32:23.234
WITH WATER PHIPPS AND OTHER

02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:24.802
RISKY PROJECTS BUNDLED AND IS

02:32:24.869 --> 02:32:26.770
WHAT'S NECESSARY TO TAKE CARE OF

02:32:26.837 --> 02:32:27.972
THE COMPRESSION PROBLEM.

02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:29.507
IT JUST SAYS YOU NEED TO EXTEND

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:31.909
THE CONTRACTS --

02:32:31.976 --> 02:32:34.478
ALONG THE SAME LINES THE

02:32:34.545 --> 02:32:36.380
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER

02:32:36.447 --> 02:32:39.416
COALITION LETTER --

02:32:39.483 --> 02:32:43.220

MORTGAGE TO A THIRTY YEAR

02:32:47.324 --> 02:32:49.026
MORTGAGE.

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:50.461
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM THOUGH

02:32:50.528 --> 02:32:52.496
IS THE RADICAL REDEFINITION OF

02:32:52.563 --> 02:32:54.398
FACILITIES WHAT THIS IS A LITTLE

02:32:54.465 --> 02:32:56.166
MORE LIKE WOULD BE TO SAY WELL

02:32:56.233 --> 02:32:57.501
YOU CAN LOWER YOUR MONTHLY

02:32:57.568 --> 02:32:58.769
PAYMENTS.

02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:00.170
IF YOU --

02:33:00.237 --> 02:33:03.307
EXTEND THE THE CONTRACT LENGTH

02:33:03.374 --> 02:33:04.975
BUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO ASSUME

02:33:05.042 --> 02:33:06.644
THAT IT'S A DONE DEAL THAT ALONG

02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:09.213
WITH THIS YOU WILL THROW IN A

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:11.382
REALLY REALLY COSTLY RENOVATION

02:33:11.448 --> 02:33:12.783
OF UNDETERMINED AMOUNT THAT

02:33:12.850 --> 02:33:15.152
MIGHT MIGHT GO INTO THE BILLIONS.

02:33:15.219 --> 02:33:16.320
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S SOMETHING

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:17.922
THAT LOOKS A LITTLE MORE LIKE

02:33:17.988 --> 02:33:21.258
THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE ADDITIONS --

02:33:21.325 --> 02:33:22.693
THAT PRECEDED THE FINANCIAL

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:25.129
CRISIS ON TAKING SOMETHING THAT

02:33:25.195 --> 02:33:26.931
HAS BRAGGED ABOUT AS TRIPLE A

02:33:26.997 --> 02:33:29.800
SUPPOSEDLY AND BUNDLING IN.

02:33:29.867 --> 02:33:31.735
POTENTIALLY STAGGERING RISKS AND

02:33:31.802 --> 02:33:35.439
COSTS THE TAXPAYERS AND REPAIRS --

02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:36.507
WILL HAVE TO PAY.

02:33:36.574 --> 02:33:38.742
THE CONTRACT EXTENSION PROCESS

02:33:38.809 --> 02:33:42.179
CANNOT BE RESOLVED SO --

02:33:42.246 --> 02:33:44.315
WITH SO LITTLE ATTENTION TO WHAT

02:33:44.381 --> 02:33:46.584
IS REALLY AT STAKE FOR THE NEXT

02:33:46.650 --> 02:33:48.552
FIFTY YEARS AMONG THE

02:33:48.619 --> 02:33:50.087
UNADDRESSED ISSUES THAT NEED TO

02:33:50.154 --> 02:33:52.623
BE CONFRONTED IN A SERIOUS WAY.

02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:53.457
ARE.

02:33:53.524 --> 02:33:55.326
UNSUSTAINABLE CONDITION OF THE

02:33:55.392 --> 02:33:57.494
CURRENT DELTA AND THE NEED TO

02:33:57.561 --> 02:33:58.963
TAKE SERIOUSLY.

02:33:59.029 --> 02:34:01.165
THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE LAW TO

02:34:01.231 --> 02:34:05.102
REDUCE RELIANCE ON ON DELTA

02:34:05.169 --> 02:34:07.538
WATER SOURCES AND ENCOURAGE

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:10.007
LOCAL SELF RELIANCE --

02:34:10.074 --> 02:34:12.443
YOU HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE ALL

02:34:12.509 --> 02:34:15.112
PAPER WATER GAP BETWEEN --

02:34:15.179 --> 02:34:17.982
ENTITLEMENTS AND AND WHAT CAN BE

02:34:18.048 --> 02:34:19.683
RELIABLY DELIVERED IN THE STATE

02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:21.685
WATER PROJECT WE NEED TO FIND

02:34:21.752 --> 02:34:24.121
OUT WHAT THE REAL CONDITIONS ARE

02:34:24.188 --> 02:34:26.023
THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE

02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:27.324
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY.

02:34:27.391 --> 02:34:29.026
SO WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IF YOU

02:34:29.093 --> 02:34:31.161
LOOK AT THE MANY --

02:34:31.228 --> 02:34:32.663
GROUPS --

02:34:32.730 --> 02:34:34.999
COUNTY NEWS AGENCIES.

02:34:35.065 --> 02:34:36.200
THAT HAVE EXPRESSED MAJOR

02:34:36.266 --> 02:34:38.302
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE

02:34:38.369 --> 02:34:40.170
DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO DO THIS

02:34:40.237 --> 02:34:42.840
IS NOT A NORTH AND SOUTH DISPUTE

02:34:42.906 --> 02:34:44.541
THIS IS NOT A DISPUTE BETWEEN

02:34:44.608 --> 02:34:45.876
ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND

02:34:45.943 --> 02:34:48.912
AGRICULTURE AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

02:34:48.979 --> 02:34:50.314
THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY.

02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:52.683
A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TWENTIETH

02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:54.284
CENTURY AND THE TWENTY FIRST

02:34:54.351 --> 02:34:56.787
CENTURY QUITE CONTRARY TO THE

02:34:56.854 --> 02:34:58.689
IMAGE OF RESILIENCE AND

02:34:58.756 --> 02:35:00.324
PREPAREDNESS FOR THE FUTURE

02:35:00.391 --> 02:35:01.291
CONDITIONS.

02:35:01.358 --> 02:35:03.694
THE ON THINKING ADDITION OF RISK

02:35:03.761 --> 02:35:04.895
AND COST TO THE STATE WATER

02:35:04.962 --> 02:35:06.664
PROJECT THE T. W. R. NOW

02:35:06.730 --> 02:35:08.165
PROPOSES --

02:35:08.232 --> 02:35:11.001
WILL PROMOTE OUTMODED.

02:35:11.068 --> 02:35:12.369
TWENTY TWENTIETH CENTURY

02:35:12.436 --> 02:35:13.871
APPROACHES.

02:35:13.937 --> 02:35:15.572
FOCUSING ON UNSUSTAINABLE

02:35:15.639 --> 02:35:17.608
SOURCES OF SUPPLY RATHER THAN

02:35:17.675 --> 02:35:19.743
FOCUSING ON LOCAL SELF RELIANCE

02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:22.446
CONSERVATION AND RESILIENCE.

02:35:22.513 --> 02:35:24.581
THE REALITY IS THAT WE CANNOT

02:35:24.648 --> 02:35:26.450
PAY FOR BOTH WHICH MEANS BEFORE

02:35:26.517 --> 02:35:28.519
ANY OF THESE CONTRACTAMENDMENTS

02:35:28.585 --> 02:35:30.521
ARE EXTENDED --

02:35:30.587 --> 02:35:33.190
WE MUST HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION

02:35:33.257 --> 02:35:34.525
TO THE PUBLIC.

02:35:34.591 --> 02:35:37.294
THAT WE CAN MAKE A REAL CHOICE.

02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:39.630
ORVILLE SHOWS --

02:35:39.697 --> 02:35:41.465
BY AS THE MONORAIL AMENDMENTS

02:35:41.532 --> 02:35:43.333
EXPERIAN SHOWS WERE REPORT THE

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.102
DEPARTMENT TOOK THE ADVICE OF A

02:35:45.169 --> 02:35:47.738
LOCAL CONTRACTOR AFFILIATE.

02:35:47.805 --> 02:35:52.076
WHO SAID THAT --

02:35:52.142 --> 02:35:53.277
THE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS WOULD BE

02:35:53.343 --> 02:35:54.878
BENEFICIAL BECAUSE THEY WOULD

02:35:54.945 --> 02:35:57.881
AVOID LITIGATION THAT WAS TWENTY

02:35:57.948 --> 02:35:59.216
FIVE YEARS OF LITIGATION AGO.

02:35:59.283 --> 02:36:01.618
SOMETIMES GW ARE WHICH CAN ACT

02:36:01.685 --> 02:36:03.320
ADMIRABLY INTERNS DONE GREAT

02:36:03.387 --> 02:36:05.589
THINGS CAN BE ITS OWN WORST

02:36:05.656 --> 02:36:06.824
ENEMY AND THE ROLE OF THE

02:36:06.890 --> 02:36:09.393
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE TO HAVE

02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:10.728
ENOUGH OVERSIGHT.

02:36:10.794 --> 02:36:13.597
THAT IT BRINGS OUT ITS BEST IN

02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:14.264
IS NOT IT'S WHAT WE'RE STANDING.

02:36:14.331 --> 02:36:16.066
THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible]

KNOW WHEN SEARCHING ELSON ASKED

02:36:26.944 --> 02:36:27.878

PANEL --

02:36:29.179 --> 02:36:30.581
ASKED WHETHER THERE POINTS

02:36:30.647 --> 02:36:32.783
REPRESENT THE PERSPECTIVE OF ALL

02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:33.851
TWENTY NINE CONTRACTORS DO YOU

02:36:33.917 --> 02:36:36.286

INTO IS THAT THERE IS NO

02:36:43.861 --> 02:36:45.362
CONSENSUS IN FACT THERE IS A

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:47.498
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON WHETHER

02:36:47.564 --> 02:36:49.867
THE DEPARTMENTS VERSION OF THE

02:36:49.933 --> 02:36:51.935
CONTRACT EXTENSION WHICH BUNDLES

02:36:52.002 --> 02:36:53.337
IN THE PART THAT WOULD

02:36:53.403 --> 02:36:54.605
FACILITATE WATER FIX.

02:36:54.671 --> 02:36:58.208
IT ALSO MAKES IT EASIER --

02:36:58.275 --> 02:36:59.943
FOR THE LARGEST CONTRACTORS IF

02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:02.946

ALL THE CONTRACTORS THE VERY

02:37:13.757 --> 02:37:15.225
SEPARATE QUESTION THOUGH IS

02:37:15.292 --> 02:37:17.694
WHETHER SOME KIND OF EXTENSION

02:37:17.761 --> 02:37:19.196
WHEN NEGOTIATIONS ARE COMPLETE

02:37:19.263 --> 02:37:20.364
WHEN THE PUBLIC HAS MORE

02:37:20.430 --> 02:37:22.833

02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:24.101
TO ALL --

02:37:24.168 --> 02:37:26.036
THERE WERE EIGHT AS WAS REFERRED

02:37:26.103 --> 02:37:27.004
TO A COUPLE OF TIMES THIS

02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:27.704
MORNING THEY'RE ACTUALLY

02:37:27.771 --> 02:37:29.840

JUST KIND OF TAKE THE TIME TO

02:53:23.459 --> 02:53:24.827
NOTE THAT THERE IS A LACK OF

02:53:24.894 --> 02:53:25.828
TRUST BETWEEN A LOT OF THE

TUNNEL PROJECT MOVING AT THE

02:53:32.735 --> 02:53:34.203
EXPENSE OF OTHER PROJECTS AND WE

02:53:34.270 --> 02:53:35.338
THINK THAT THERE DOES NEED TO BE

02:53:35.404 --> 02:53:36.539
STATUTORY CHANGES TO INCREASE

02:53:36.606 --> 02:53:37.473

TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S PUBLIC

02:53:46.315 --> 02:53:47.116
SAFETY --

02:53:47.183 --> 02:53:48.451
AND ALSO TO THAT CAN INCREASE

02:53:50.319 --> 02:53:51.721
INVESTMENTS IN UPPER WATERSHEDS

02:53:51.788 --> 02:53:52.889
TO ENSURE THAT THAT THAT THINGS

02:53:52.955 --> 02:53:54.157
ARE OPERATING LIKE THEY SHOULD

02:53:54.223 --> 02:53:55.925
SO IMPLORE THAT THE BIGGEST

02:53:55.992 --> 02:53:56.959
LESSON WE TAKE FROM THIS.

02:53:57.026 --> 02:53:58.528
IS THAT THERE DOES NEED TO BE A

02:53:58.594 --> 02:54:00.797
GREATER ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE

02:54:00.863 --> 02:54:02.665
IN THIS PROCESS AND MORE IN A OF

02:54:02.732 --> 02:54:03.766
A BARRIER BETWEEN TWO TO BE ON

ALREADY BEEN SAID THAT THE YOU

TUNNELS.

02:54:35.598 --> 02:54:37.433
AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:38.668
FULL COST OF THE DELTA*

02:54:38.734 --> 02:54:40.770
TUNNELS WOULD BE NOR THE COST OF

02:54:40.837 --> 02:54:42.572
OF HUGE PROJECTS LIKE ORVILLE

02:54:42.638 --> 02:54:44.340
THESE KIND OF MEGAPROJECTS DON'T

02:54:44.407 --> 02:54:45.875
HAVE A CLEAR ESTIMATES.

02:54:45.942 --> 02:54:47.777
AND YET THIS INDEBTEDNESS THAT

02:54:47.844 --> 02:54:49.745
WOULD BE FACILITATED BY THOSE

02:54:49.812 --> 02:54:51.380
EXTENSIONS --

02:54:51.447 --> 02:54:53.115
WOULD BE PLACED ON THE PUBLIC

02:54:53.182 --> 02:54:54.283
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT HASN'T

02:54:54.350 --> 02:54:55.451
BEEN MENTIONED TODAY THAT THE

02:54:55.518 --> 02:54:57.787
FEDERAL PARTICIPATION IN WATER

02:54:57.854 --> 02:54:59.522
IN THE DELTA TUNNELS PROJECT IS

02:54:59.589 --> 02:55:00.923
REALLY IN QUESTION RIGHT NOW

02:55:00.990 --> 02:55:02.825
THERE IS NO FORMAL CVP

02:55:02.892 --> 02:55:04.594
PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT.

02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:06.329
AND IT MAY BE THAT IT'S THE

02:55:06.395 --> 02:55:09.198
STATE WATER PROJECT ONLY --

02:55:09.265 --> 02:55:11.634
FACILITY WHICH REALLY COULD DO

02:55:11.701 --> 02:55:14.770
RATE PAYERS WITHIN CALIFORNIA --

02:55:14.837 --> 02:55:16.205
AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

02:55:16.272 --> 02:55:17.940
THE LEGISLATURE BE THE ADULT IN

02:55:18.007 --> 02:55:19.542
THE ROOM PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT

02:55:19.609 --> 02:55:21.611
THAT'S NEEDED SO THAT IDW ARE

02:55:21.677 --> 02:55:23.179
DOESN'T MOVE FORWARD ON A

02:55:23.246 --> 02:55:25.047
RECKLESS PATH THAT WOULD DO THAT --

02:55:25.114 --> 02:55:26.315
AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE

02:55:26.382 --> 02:55:27.550
STATE WATER PROJECT WAS

02:55:27.617 --> 02:55:29.085
INITIALLY ESTIMATED TO BE ONE

02:55:29.151 --> 02:55:31.120
POINT FIVE SEVEN ONE POINT SEVEN

02:55:31.187 --> 02:55:31.821
FIVE BILLION AS WAS MENTONED

02:55:31.888 --> 02:55:34.624
BUT THAT COST HAS ESCALATED UP.

02:55:34.690 --> 02:55:36.092
TO SEVEN BILLION --

02:55:36.158 --> 02:55:37.193
SO.

02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:38.961
D. W. R. SHOULD IF IT'S REALLY

02:55:39.028 --> 02:55:39.695
NOT.

02:55:39.762 --> 02:55:41.330
NOT IF THESE OTHER AMENDMENTS
