00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.356

STANDARD THAT BY WHICH THEY

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:17.463

YOU KNOW TO THE TO THE LEVEL

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:26.972
THAT THAT IS NEEDED. THAT SEEMS

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.774
TO BE MAYBE WHAT THE PROBLEM

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:31.176

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:36.848

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:38.149
YEAH THEY THEY TALK A GOOD GAME

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.652

LEGISLATION. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:07.078

THIS IS- NOT A BINDING.

00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:12.650

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.055
BUILT BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:18.690

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:26.631
THINK LAW. YOU MAY RECALL THAT-

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:28.700
EARLIER IN A POLL ON. HOW

00:29:28.766 --> 00:29:31.002
CLIMATE ENVOY- JOHN KERRY HAD A

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:32.437
MEETING WITH ONE OF THE HIGHER

00:29:32.504 --> 00:29:34.372
UPS IN CHINA I. DON'T REMEMBER

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.107
THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN. WHO

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:38.877
JOINTLY ISSUED A STATEMENT TO.

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:40.812
COLLABORATE ON THE ISSUE OF

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:42.680
CLIMATE. AND THIS IS PRETTY

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:43.815
MUCH IN LINE WITH WHAT THE

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:45.884
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING-

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.352
THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:48.820
IDENTIFYING ISSUES THAT WE CAN

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.055
WORK WITH CHINA ON. A WHEN IT

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:53.525
COMES TO CLIMATE- CHINA HAS TO

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.126
BE PART OF THE EQUATION AS I

00:29:55.193 --> 00:29:57.095
STATED EARLIER- DAY CURRENTLY

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:59.931
IN MAY 28% OF THE WORLD'S

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:00.532
CARBON DIOXIDE AND THAT'S THE

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:02.700
KIND OF. A STEP THAT WE BREATHE

00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:05.170
IN EVERY DAY. SO THE SOONER

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:06.804
THAT WE COULD GET CHINA TO DROP

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.173
THAT NUMBER DOWN FROM TWENTY

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:12.210
PERCENT. THE SOONER WE CAN

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:13.511
BREATHE CLEANER AIR. SO TO DATA

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:15.213
THE INTENT UP BECAUSE- WE NEED.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.614
TO WORK WITH THEM SO THAT THEY

00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:18.516
COULD. HI SENSUALLY YOU'LL GET

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:20.785
THEIR NUMBER DOWN AND DATE THEY

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:22.020
HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN DOING

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.655
THIS AS WELL. BUT YOU KNOW

00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:24.889
GIVEN THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:26.958
IS LOCATED SO CLOSE TO. TO

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.593
CHINA I THINK WE BEAR THE BRUNT

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.495
AND I THINK YOU KNOW COMPARED

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:32.463
TO OTHER STATES SO WE HAVE A E.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.366
NO EVEN A STRONGER INTEREST. IT

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:37.368
GETTING THEIR NUMBER DOWN.

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:40.104
RIGHT AS WELL AS OUR NUMBER SO.

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.372
IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:43.541
BOTH PARTIES TO. CONTINUE THIS

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:45.510
KIND OF COLLABORATION I DO

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:46.844
UNDERSTAND THAT ARE YOU KNOW.

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:48.713
AT THE HAS THE GOVERNOR SAID

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.415
CHINA MAY HAVE ISSUES AND

00:30:50.481 --> 00:30:51.482
POLICIES THAT WE DON'T ALL

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:53.718
AGREE WITH. BUT BUT YET THAT

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:55.420

DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM. AND

00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:03.461
TOP. CIVIL BOB SO WE NEED TO

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.430
KEEP DOING THOSE OF BECAUSE- IN

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:06.798
A WEEK YEAH THIS HAS BEEN GOING

00:31:06.864 --> 00:31:08.466
ON FOR A WHILE AS FAR AS

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.802

BEEN DOING NUMBER ONE. AND

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:18.643
NUMBER TWO TO DEMONSTRATE THE

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.744
FACT THAT WE SHOULD BILL

POLLUTE IT SO. MY POINT IS.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.474
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:51.909
WITH THESE OTHER GUYS A

00:31:51.976 --> 00:31:52.777
COMMUNIST COUNTRY THAT SLAVES

00:31:52.844 --> 00:31:54.746

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:32.302
COMPLICATED AND WE NEED TO MAKE

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.338
THOSE STUDIES WE CAN DO IT IN A

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:36.540

WAR OVER TAIWAN IT'S PRETTY

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:52.883
IMPORTANT THE RESULT IN SOME WE

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.718
KEEP OPEN SOME CHANNELS OF

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.620
COMMUNICATION VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:45:56.687 --> 00:45:59.756
EXCHANGE IDEAS ON THESE CLIMATE

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:01.525
TOPICS. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:02.759
GOING TO SOLVE. ALL THE

00:46:02.826 --> 00:46:05.629
PROBLEMS BUT IT IS A POSITIVE.

00:46:05.696 --> 00:46:07.197
SET OF STEPS THAT THE

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:09.399
LEGISLATURE TO BE A PART OF-

00:46:09.466 --> 00:46:12.069
THE UC IT WAS THE CALIFORNIA-

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:14.271
CAN ALSO BE A PART OF AND WHICH

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:16.140
I'M LOOKING AT AND IF THESE ARE

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:19.209
SMALL. BUT POSITIVE STEPS TO A

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:22.513
SAFER- MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:28.852
COMPATIBLE. WORLD WHICH WE ALL

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:30.787
WANT TO LIVE THERE. OKAY WHAT

THE NEW CAR. ABSOLUTELY

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:38.762
CERTAINLY CLIMATE TO SOME ON WE

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:40.597
WITNESSING IN MY DISTRICT THAT.

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:41.999
I DON'TTHINK YOU CAN HAVE-

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:43.934
COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:45.002
UNLESS YOU HAVE COMPLIANT

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:47.037
PARTNERS. IN I DO NOT BELIEVE

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:48.472
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:51.475
SHOWN IN ANY WAY- IN TERMS OF

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:52.509
THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:54.111
COUNTRY THAT THEY ARE COMPLIANT

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:56.013
AND FOLLOW THE RULES. AND WE

00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:57.281
CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT OUR OWN

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:58.549
INDUSTRIES THEY FOLLOW THE

00:46:58.615 --> 00:46:59.783
RULES MAYBE THEY DON'T LIKE

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.285
THEM. AND THEN THEY FIND A WAY

00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:02.886
OUT THEY GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:04.154
IF THEY CAN GET CHEAPER LABOR

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:06.190
BUT THEY WOULD STAY HERE. IF WE

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:07.124
DON'T DID NOT HAVE THE

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.825
REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT THEY

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:10.961
HAVE TO NAVIGATE A TO PRODUCE

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.062
THEIR PRODUCTS AND WE OUGHT TO

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:13.330
BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:15.132
THAT. THAT WOULD HELP OUR I

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:17.000
THINK TREMENDOUSLY BUT FOR

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:19.169
TODAY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:48.799
SIGNIFICANCE OF CHINA AND THIS

00:47:48.865 --> 00:47:49.499
CONVERSATION IN THE NEED FOR

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:51.802
CHINA. A FOR US TO WORK WITH

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:52.336
CHINA IN ADDRESSING THIS

00:47:52.402 --> 00:47:56.139
CHALLENGE. B. TO BE GIVEN THE

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:58.275
CONCERNS ABOUT. ABOUT THE

00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:00.344

COMMITTEE BE THINKING ABOUT.

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:12.289
ABOUT THAT CHALLENGE ABOUT THIS

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:12.756
AT THAT ASPECT OF THIS

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:16.560
CHALLENGE. VERY BROAD QUESTION

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.362
FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO BE

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:22.499
FOCUSING ON. U. S. RELATIONSHIP

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:24.568
THAT'S HUGE AND THEY'RE QUITE

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.036
FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THE

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.771
PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON HAVE GOT

00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:30.140
IT RIGHT QUITE YET AND EVEN

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:32.909
WHAT IS RIGHT IT TAKES A LOT OF

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:34.611
INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING AND A

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:36.013
LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.047
THERE'S DIFFERENT POINTS OF

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:38.715
VIEW ON HOW TO HANDLE THE

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:40.851
CHINESE BUT I CAN TELL YOU ONE

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:43.020
THING. IF YOU JUST- SAY

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:45.055
DEMONISE THEM AND SAY THEY'RE

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:47.057
THE INHERENTLY EVIL WE'RE NEVER

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:49.126
GONNA TALK TO THEM- THAT'S NOT

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:51.728
HELPFUL DIALOGUE IS NOT A

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:53.697
REWARD- BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.532
SOMEBODY DIALOGUE IS A

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.601
NECESSITY- PARTICULARLY WHEN

00:48:57.668 --> 00:48:59.336
YOU HAVE ADVERSARIAL

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:01.538
RELATIONSHIP SINCE WE HAVE AND

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:04.541
THE BUSINESS CLIMATE IS CHINA

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:05.442
HAS SHOWN IN MANY WAYS MORE

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:07.110
LEADERSHIP THE AMERICAN IT WAS

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:09.413
TRUMP THE PULLED OUT OF- THE

00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:11.148
PARIS AGREEMENT. IS TRUMP THAT

00:49:11.214 --> 00:49:13.917
CANCELED- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

00:49:13.984 --> 00:49:14.985
FIFTEEN HUNDRED ENVIRONMENTAL

00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:16.753
REGULATIONS WAS IN THE CHINESE

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.255
NOW WE'RE GETTING BACK TO SOME

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.290
OF THAT BUT WE HAVE MANY STAGE

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:21.958
AND WE'RE MONEY LEGISLATORS BUT

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:23.293
WANT TO GO IN THE OPPOSITE

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.195
DIRECTION SO IT'S NOT JUST

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:27.864
CHINA- ALL OF US ALL HUMAN

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.499
BEINGS DRIVING A HARD TIME

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.868
FINDING WAYS TO GET OFF FOSSIL

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:35.072
FUEL TO GET TO A PROSPEROUS-

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:36.940
ACADEMY. BASED ON RENEWABLE

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:38.875
ENERGY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:40.944
THIS IS A MATTER NOT JUST FOR

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.146
POLITICIANS BUT FOR

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:44.881
INTELLECTUALS FOR ACADEMICS

00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:46.283
RESEARCHERS AND THAT'S WHAT

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.752
WE'RE DOING IS ALSO A

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.854
RESPONSIBILITY OF DIPLOMATS- TO

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:53.290
TRY TO CREATE OPENINGS-

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:55.225
WHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE I THINK

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.660
WHEN THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA'S

00:49:56.727 --> 00:49:58.495
GOVERNOR NEWSOM DID SPEAK WITH

00:49:58.562 --> 00:49:59.930
THE GOVERNOR OF GUANGDONG

00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:01.231
THAT'S A POSITIVE WHEN THE

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:02.966
MAYOR OF LA HE SPOKE WITH THE

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.868
MAYOR OF SHANGHAI. THAT'S GOOD

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:07.070
I MEAN LOOK THE WAR DRUMS ARE

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:10.040
BEATING AND THAT CHINA MAY WELL

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:11.274
TAKE BACK TAIWAN THEY THINK

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.909
THAT THERE'S AND IF WE WANT TO

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:14.144
DEFEND THEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:16.413
WORLD WAR THREE SO YOU DON'T

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.081
WHAT YOU KNOW DON'T WORRY

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:25.555
THERE'S PLENTY. A CONFLICT WITH

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:27.457
CHINA I'M JUST SAYING LET'S

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:28.992
FOR. THOSE OF MY PATHWAYS OR

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:30.794
THE USUAL CLIMATE THAT THE SUB.

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:33.029
LEVEL WE CAN. A LOT OF STRONG.

00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:34.965
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. DID

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:39.269
YOU GO HOW HELPFUL. OKAY GOOD

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:41.037
DISCUSSION THE DISCUSSION

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:43.740
ROBUST DISCUSSION AND- THE

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:46.743
ITEMS BEEN MOVED BY- SILVA

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.446
CASKEY I'M IF YOU'D LIKE TO

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:50.313
CLOSE I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.716
THOUGHTS ON ABSOLUTELY I

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:54.351
COULDN'T POSSIBLY REPEAT WHAT

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:56.186
THE GOVERNOR SET UP I AGREE

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:58.155
TOTALLY WITH WHAT HE SAID AND I

00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.923
THINK YOU KNOW. IF I COULD JUST

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.892
PERHAPS SO GIVE A QUICK

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:04.461
RESPONSE ON ON- THE QUESTION

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:05.028
RAISED BY THE BY THE OTHER

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:09.032
SENATOR. I THINK CHINA HAS MADE

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:11.134
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS OVER THE

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:13.036
YEARS AND I THINK YOU KNOW A

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:13.637
PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF

00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:15.305
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEN I YOU

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:16.807
KNOW I DON'T THINK WEEK WEEK WE

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:19.876
SHOULD EXPECT. HE ADDED I THINK

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:21.678
THE LEVEL OF EXPECTATION AUTUMN

00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:24.114
OUGHT TO BE REASONABLE I THINK

ACCUMULATING CHEMICALS SO IT

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.983
STORES UP IN FATTY TISSUE OF

CAN VITAMINS IS ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.428
FIFTY YEARS MEANING THAT IT

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:09.399
WILL TAKE HUNDREDS OF YEARS TO

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:10.633
FULLY BREAKDOWN DDT. BUT WE

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.668
THOUGHT WE HAD DEALT WITH THIS

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:13.503
ISSUE WHEN MONTROSE SHUT DOWN

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:14.604

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:27.951
SOMETHING HAD BEEN DONE.

00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:31.354
HOWEVER STARTING IN THE TWENTY

WASTE. IN OUR AT SEA LIFE.

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.364
WE'VE SEEN IN FACT EVIDENCE

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.698
THAT MANY OF THESE BARRELS

00:57:15.765 --> 00:57:17.267
AREN'T JUST CONTAINED AND

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.302

SUPPORTS AJ ARE TO THE

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:11.601
IMPORTANT STEP IN SOLVING THIS

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.236
BT KEY PROBLEM IN OUR LOCAL

PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT DDT

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:26.916
CONTAMINATION IN THE FISH THAT

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.151
THEY'RE FEEDING THEIR FAMILIES

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:30.186
SUCH AS ONE OF THE IMPACT OF

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:32.121
THIS TOXIC DUMPING. THE LATEST

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.423
DISCLOSURES OF THE DEEPWATER

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:35.525
DUMPSITE ARE DEVASTATING AS YOU

01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:36.826
DESCRIBED AND THEY HIGHLIGHT

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.428
BASE OF PROBLEM THAT IS NOT

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:40.663
GOING AWAY AND CONTINUES TO

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.964
HARM PEOPLE AND OUR ENVIRONMENT

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.833
EVERY DAY. IT IS NOT BEEN

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.867
ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED BY

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. OR THE

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:49.405
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. BUT THERE

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:50.473
ARE SOME STEPS. THAT WE MUST

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.041
TAKE NOW AND THIS RESOLUTION IS

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.676
PART OF THAT. THE FEDERAL

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:55.378
GOVERNMENT MUST FUND THE

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.313
SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENTS TO FIND

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.048
THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:00.716
AS WELL AS STUDIES OF THE

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.885
TRANSPORT AND FATE OF THE DDT

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.387
AND OTHER CHEMICALS. BECAUSE

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:07.023
THE DUE PROCESS FOR A LONG TIME

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:07.623
AND THEY DO MOVE THROUGH FOOD

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:09.692
CHAIN. WE MUST INCREASE

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.160
EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO REACH

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:12.662
MORE OF THE VULNERABLE

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:14.730
POPULATIONS WHO ARE AT RISK

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.632
FROM EATING AND FEEDING TO

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:18.067
THEIR FAMILIES INCLUDING

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.902
PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.271
BUILD DEVELOPING IN THEIR-

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:24.107
METALLURGICAL SYSTEM THEY NEED

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.274
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FISH

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:26.809
WERE CONTAMINATED AND WHAT THE

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.878
RISKS ARE EATING THE FISH. WE

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.113
SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE DUMPING

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:32.014
PERMIT IN RECORDS TO DETERMINE

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.916
WHO ELSE WAS RESPONSIBLE WHO

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.685
PRODUCED THIS WAY AND PROFITED

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.220
FROM THE THING WE CAN SEEK

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:38.955
FINANCIAL COMPENSATION TO HELP

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:40.456
PAY FROM THE- RELIGIOUS SAID

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:44.861
IT'S. GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:45.461
IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE. I

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:46.863
FINALLY. WE MUST ACT UP TO DUMP

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:49.065
SITE WHERE POSSIBLE. THE TV

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.466
SULFATE WHICH IS CLOSE THE

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:51.868
PROSPERITY HAS A DEDICATED

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.035
SETTLEMENT FUNDS BUT VERY

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:53.970
LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE TO

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.972
ACTUALLY CLEAN UP THAT NIGHT.

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:57.440
RIGHT NOW HE PAGE RELYING ON

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.142
NATURAL REMEDIATION OR NATURAL

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.643
BREAKDOWN IN THE ENVIRONMENT

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.111
BUT BECAUSE OF THE INADEQUATE

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:03.579
MONITORING. WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:05.915
DATA TO BEGIN TO KNOW IF THIS

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.284
IS WORKING. OR WHERE THAT DD

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.219
IS GOING AS IT BREAKS DOWN INTO

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.788
ITS- BREAKDOWN PRODUCTS WHICH

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.524
STILL HAVE TOXICITY THEMSELVES.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.191
SO THAT'S WHY FUNDING OF

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:17.059
SCIENCE DETERMINES THAT THERE

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:18.261
AND WHERE IT STANDING UP IS SO

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:20.763
CRITICAL AND AJ ARE TOO IS AN

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:24.333

LINES OF THE FACTS WE SHOULD BE

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:32.575
MOST CONCERNED ABOUT AND- IN A

01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:34.243
AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS.

THE G. YES. THANK YOU- WELL THE

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.696
TOP LINE AFFECTS OUR BED

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:54.897
SENATORS YOU'RE MENTIONED

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:57.333
CANCER AND ENDOCRINE OR

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.801
REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS AND WE

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.970
KNOW THAT THE CANCER CAUSING

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:02.972
CHEMICALS NOT ONLY IN THE LAB

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.406
WORK THROUGH DIRECT EXPOSURE

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.108
BUT THROUGH THE FOOD CHAIN AND

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.510
WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:08.611
EPIDEMIC OF CANCER THAT WE'RE

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:10.246
SEEING IN FELINES WHICH HAS

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:11.947
BEEN LINKED CONCLUSIVELY TO THE

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:14.517
DDT CYLINDER MAMMALS JUST LIKE

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:17.019
US THEY'RE EATING FISH AND IT'S

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:17.920
CONCENTRATING THROUGH THE FOOD

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.222
CHAIN. AND INTO THEIR TISSUES

01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:22.057
AND CAUSING CANCER WE KNOW THAT

01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:23.959
PEOPLE ARE ALSO EATING FISH

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:25.060
WERE SOME OF THE TOP PREDATORS

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.929
IN THE OCEAN AND WE KNOW THAT

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.297
FISH THAT PEOPLE CONSUME

01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:29.064
LOCALLY HAVE HIGH

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:31.233
CONCENTRATIONS OF DDT SO THAT'S

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.636
MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN IF WOMEN

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:34.937
WHO ARE PREGNANT OR CHILDREN

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.906
WHO ARE STILL DEVELOPING BRAINS

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:39.608
AND NERVOUS SYSTEM- CONCEALMENT

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.478
FISH IT CAN HAVE A VERY VERY

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:45.781
AREA- HARM TO THEM CAN CAUSE

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.416
VERY SERIOUS HARM TO THEM.

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:49.985
ANOTHER AFFECT THAT IS ONLY

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:52.221
BECOMING CLEAR OVER TIME IS THE

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:55.257
LONG TERM GENERATIONAL IMPACT

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.393
AND THAT'S REALLY SCARY TO ME

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:58.761
AND I THINK TO EVERYONE BECAUSE

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:00.996
WE NOW KNOW THAT CHILDREN AND

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:02.831
GRAND CHILDREN OF WOMEN WHO

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:04.833
WERE DIRECTLY EXPOSED TO DDT IN

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.569
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES CHAU

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:09.572
REPRODUCTIVE IMPACTS TODAY THAT

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:12.207
THE EARLY ONSET OF MENSTRUATION

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:15.044
THE CHANGES IN MENSTRUAL

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.313
PERIODS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:19.148
FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE. AND

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:21.684
ALSO THE BAY CITY AND OTHER

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:24.920
HORMONE RELATED ILLNESSES ARE

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:27.556
PRESENT IN A GRAND CHILDREN OF

01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:28.691
WOMEN WHO ARE EXPOSED EACH IN

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:30.225
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES SO WE ARE

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.628
WE JUST FIND OUT OVER TIME JUST

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:35.030
HOW BAD HOW PERVASIVE. NEED

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.032
CHEMICAL ARE AND THOSE THAT IT

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.434
EVEN HARDER TO DO IN WILDLIFE

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.768
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN DOLPHINS

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.170
AND WHALES WE DON'T KNOW THEY

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:46.575
MARRIED. BE SHOWING THE SAME.

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.544
IMPACT SO FIRST PART OF YOUR

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:52.581
YEAH I. THE NEXT PART. WELL THE

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:55.484
QUESTION BILL WANNA GO ON TO ON

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.786
LITTLE SUMMARY MEDIATION- AND

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.154
SO I KNOW THIS ISN'T A NEW

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:01.724
PROBLEM I MEAN THE SO THE

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.292
PALACE VERDES COASTAL SHELF. I

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.794
HAD D. V. T. WASTE. WITH THE

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:07.663
DISCHARGE OFFSHORE- THAT'S BEEN

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.331
A SUPERFUND SITE SINCE NINETEEN

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:12.167
EIGHTY NINE I BELIEVE. I'M SO.

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:13.636
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.471
EFFORTS THERE AND HOW HOW THE

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:16.572
EFFORTS THERE MIGHT INFORM A

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.273
RESPONSE OF THE DUMPSITES

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.042
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT. THE

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.410
EFFORTS THERE IT MORE YOU KNOW

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:22.544
WHAT WHAT WE KEEP HEARING IS

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:24.146
THAT THIS IS JUST AN IMMENSELY

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:27.149
DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO SOLVE-

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:29.351
WHAT WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:32.388
EXISTING SUPER FIND ACTIVITIES

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:37.159
HAPPENING OFF THE COAST. WELL I

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:38.460
THINK THAT'S A GREAT APPROACH

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:39.762
SENATOR BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:41.430
DIFFICULT PROBLEM AND WE FEEL

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:42.398
LIKE TRYING THEIR HANDS IN THE

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:43.666
AIR. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT'S

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:44.967
NOT A NEW PROBLEM WE HAVE BEEN

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:47.169
DOING THIS OFF THE PULSE RATIO

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:50.305
BUT WE DO HAVE- ASSIGNED THE

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:51.640
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION SOME

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:52.941
OF IT THANKS THANKS IT'S ONLY

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.376
BEEN SPENT ON THE INSTITUTIONAL

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:56.078
CONTROLS AS FAR AS I KNOW WHICH

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.814
IS- PREVENTING THE SALE OF

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:00.816
LOCAL FISHING FISH MARKET. AND

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.418
REACHING OUT TO LIKE WE HAVE

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:04.253
PEOPLE WALKING ON PEERS TALKING

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:07.256
TO. ANGLERS ABOUT THE DANGER OF

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:08.791
BEING THIS ISSUE THEIR FAMILIES

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:11.060
WHAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER IS

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:12.561
ACTUALLY MONITOR WHAT'S

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.430
HAPPENING TO THIS CHEMICAL IN

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.597
THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT IN THE

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.399
SENTIMENT IN THE WATER. IN THE

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:19.868
ANIMALS IN THE OCEAN FORGET

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.870
PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:25.040
WE CAN LEARN FROM- THE LACK

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:27.710
BEEN. LESS SUCCESSFUL WORK ON

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:30.946
THE TV SHOW SO FAR- ALSO ON THE

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.748
TV SHOW WE HAVE HAD A PILOT

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:34.683
PROJECT. WHEN WE TRIED TO DO

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.318
CAPPING WHICH MEANS YOU PUT AN

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.487
INNER CAP THAT SENTIMENT ON TOP

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.255
OF THE CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT TO

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:41.356
PREVENT THE CONTAMINATED

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:42.958
SEDIMENT FROM ESCAPING INTO THE

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:46.061
ENVIRONMENT. THAT WAS SUSPENDED

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:53.001
THAT CAPPING PROJECT- IN PART

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:55.337
BECAUSE- THE EPA. MONITORING

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:56.939
WITH MACHINES JUST IT BREAK

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.941
DOWN IN THE IN BY. I'M BORED.

01:12:59.007 --> 01:12:59.942
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN. UP ANOTHER.

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:02.311
COLOR TO KNOW. IF THAT'S

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:04.246
WORKING AND WHERE THAT DDT IS

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:05.647
GOING BECAUSE WHEN IT BREAKS

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.249
DOWN IT DOESN'T JUST GO RIGHT

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:10.018
FROM DDT. TO HARMLESS CHEMICALS

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:12.621
LIKE CARBON AND NITROGEN THAT

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:13.188
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH SEVERAL

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:15.557
STAGES OF. OTHER TOXIC

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.659
BREAKDOWN PRODUCTS OF THE DTE

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:19.728
LIKE BEEF FOR EXAMPLE BUT WE

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:20.896
REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND MUCH

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.998
BETTER WHERE IT'S GOING IT'S NO

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.566
LONGER IN THE SENTIMENT IN THE

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:25.934
SAME LOCATION AND THAT'S

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.870
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO. AND

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:31.907
THAT. SCIENTISTS AT. THE UC

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.876
SANTA BARBARA AND SCRIPT. AND

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.177
NOW I HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.612
DO AND THAT'S WHY THE FEDERAL

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:38.213
FUNDING WILL BE SO IMPORTANT

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.415
THAT WE CAN SEE. WHAT IS OUT

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:42.951
THERE HOW MUCH WHERE IT IS THAT

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:47.689
HE SAID WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE.

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:48.791
FULL EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM- AND

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:51.059
WHERE IT'S GOING THE FOR CHAIN.

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:52.427
I'M DOCTOR WAS EITHER BEING

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:54.329
SHORT OF PRESSURING THE FADS

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:55.464
WHICH OF COURSE IS SEEMS TO BE

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:56.799
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:58.734
THING WE CAN DO ON THIS TOPIC.

01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:01.670
I'M WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE WHAT

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:02.905
WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE STATE'S

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:04.773
ROLE IN ALL THIS LIKE WHAT WHAT

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.908
WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO THOSE OF

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.843
US. IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHO

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.645
WERE. REALLY DISTRESSED AND

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:10.345
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THIS

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:12.381
CHALLENGE. WHAT WHAT IT WHAT IS

01:14:12.447 --> 01:14:14.216
YOUR ADVICE FOR ASSISTANCE AS A

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:17.953
STEP TO ANNOTATE. I THINK WE

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.655
SHOULD COMMIT SOME SMALLER

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:21.123
AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING TO HELP

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.991
MAKE SURE THIS GETS STARTED.

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.593
AND I ALSO THINK THAT THE

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.396
STATE- CAN LOOK INTO THE

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:29.064
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.533
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND FIGURE OUT

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.701
IF THERE IS FURTHER

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:35.337
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT CAN BE-

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:38.040
SURFACE SO THAT WE CAN. GET THE

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:39.775
PROPER AMOUNT OF FUNDING AS YOU

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:40.943
SAID IT WASN'T ENOUGH THE FIRST

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:41.844
TIME AROUND THE MAYBE DIFFERENT

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:43.045
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE DUMPING

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:45.380
THIS TIME. WE HAVE RECORDS AND

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:46.615
THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE I THINK

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:47.516
THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:49.451
OFFICE. COULD REALLY PURSUE

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:50.986
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE DUMPING

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:53.222
ITSELF. I ALSO HOPE THAT THE

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:55.424
STATE WILL PUT IN PLACE ALONG

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.025
WITH THE FEDS. SOME SORT OF

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.827
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE BECAUSE

01:14:58.894 --> 01:14:59.761
