VERY CONCERNING NEWS. FROM OUR COURTS- THAT THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO STAY A LOCAL JUDGES A LOCAL ALAMEDA SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE'S DECISION TO CAP A STUDENT ENROLLMENT. AND JUST TO REMIND THE PUBLIC THAT THE STUDENT ENROLLMENT AT BERKELEY AS WELL AS UNIVERSITIES AT UCCS YOU COMMUNICATE ALL JUST. HAVE ALL BEEN GROWING AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE FACED A TWO MILLION. DEGREE SHORTFALL OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS BY THE TIME TWENTY THIRTY COMES AROUND. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO GROW ECONOMICALLY CONTINUE TO GROW OUR FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IS IF WE CONTINUE TO. ALLOW PEOPLE ACCESS TO OUR WONDERFUL HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AS WELL AS WE CAN KEEP IT AFFORDABLE SO BERKELEY AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER STATIONS HAS BEEN GROWING. AT OUR REQUEST AND ARE ACTUALLY AT OUR DIRECTION- THE BILL SB ONE ONE EIGHT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM- MISTER MARTIN FROM MARCH. THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE. IS A- CLARIFICATION TOUCHING. ON THE WAY THAT OUR COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES DO THEIR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. AS WELL AS WHAT KIND OF REMEDIES A JUDGE MAY BE ABLE TO ORDER- LET ME ALSO. ALSO ADDRESS THAT THAT DONE IN PARTICULAR IS THE MAIN POINT OF THE BILL IS ALSO MAKING SURE THAT UNIVERSITIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDY THE SITUATION BEFORE- A DRACONIAN VERDICT WOULD BE. PUT DOWN BUT LET ME LET ME JUST ALSO JUST START OFF BY THANKING ALL THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY WORKED VERY VERY TIRELESSLY OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS IT'S AS AS YOU ALL KNOW- BILLS. WITH THIS DOWN WITH THIS KIND OF URGENCY DO NOT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN BUT GIVEN THE- IMPACT ON FIVE THOUSAND POTENTIAL FAMILIES WHO WERE NOT GOING TO GET. A NOTICES OF ADMISSIONS TO THE UC BERKELEYWE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ACT AND TO ACT QUICKLY AND SWIFTLY SO WE'RE VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THESE BILLS TODAY. WELL LET ME JUST ALSO THANK SENATOR SKINNER MY COUNTERPART IN THE SENATE IN ALL OF HER. IN A TEAM WHO WORKED VERY VERY HARD ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS THE SENATE PRO TEM- THE SENATE PRO TEM AS WELL. LET ME ALSO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE. WHO ARE CHAIRS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE. COMMITTEES NOW WITH MR STONE MYSTERY OF US MISS WICKS AND OBVIOUSLY OUR OUR GREAT CENTURY HUMANS MCCARTY. AS WELL AS OUR SPEAKER. SPEAKER RENDON WHO DID A PHENOMENAL JOB AND REALLY WORKING TO GET THIS BILL HERE AT THIS TIME. BUT I THINK AGAIN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REITERATE- WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE- WE KNOW AS A STATE THERE'S A VERY LARGE DEMAND FOR OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND WE NEED ALL THE- DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES WHETHER IT'S BERKELEY OR SAN FRANCISCO STATE OR SAC STATE HERE. FOR UC DAVIS IN OUR IN OURLOCAL AREA. TO CONTINUE TO GROW SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO OFFER ACCESS TO THIS. EXTRAORDINARY SYSTEM THAT THE STATE HAS INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. OVER THE YEARS SO LET LET ME START AND WE'LL GO TO SB. ONE ONE EIGHT. WASHINGTON THE MISSING MR FUNG HAS ANY COMMENTS NOPE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO S. B. R. ONE ONE EIGHT WE HAVE MISTER MARTIN FROM OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE. HI MARK MY WITH SIMILAR BUDGET COMMITTEE- SB ONE EIGHTEEN MAKES THE FOLLOWING CHANGES THAT CLARIFIES THAT WHEN I. WHEN CAMPUSES ARE CONDUCTING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON CAMPUS POPULATION- IT STATES THAT CHANGES IN ENROLLMENT BY ITSELF OR NOT ENOUGH TO TRIGGER FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AND IT STATES THAT IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE CAMPUS HAS INCREASED ITS CAMPUS POPULATION BEYOND PROJECTIONS IN ITS PLANNING DOCUMENTS. IT MAY REQUIRE CAMPUS TO CONDUCT FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF THAT COURT ORDER. IF THE CAMPUS IS NOT CERTIFIED THAT REVIEW WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS THEN THE COURT MAY CAP CAMPUS POPULATION AT THE NUMBER PREVIOUSLY PLANNED FOR- IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL APPLIES THE SECTION RETROACTIVELY- THIS BILL DOES NOT RELIEVE CAMPUSES FROM SEA QUOTE IN ANYWAY. WE THINK THE BILL CLARIFIES THE SEQUEL PROCESS FOR CAMPUSES. AND ASSURES THE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE NOT HARMED WHEN THERE IS LEGAL CONFLICT OVER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AS THE CHAIR NOTED THE BILL SEEKS TO BALANCE TO STATE PRIORITIES ONE WHICH SEEKS TO ENSURE HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS FOR STUDENTS. AND ONE WHICH SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT CAMPUSES REVIEW- AND MITIGATE WHEN THEIR POPULATION IS GROWING. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANKS FOR SMART WILL GO TO MISTER KHALID BERMAN FINANCE. AFTER GOOD MORNING ERIC LEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST ADD THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO ENSURE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION WHILE MAINTAINING BROADER C. CLUB- PROVISIONS TO ASSESS AND MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. PROJECTS THANK YOU THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM THIS PERCENT AT ELLIOT. ALLEN AS JENNIFER PATEL LA OVER HERE JUST ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE BILL. THANK YOU FIVE. TO THE COMMITTEE FEW QUICK QUESTIONS- TO THE L. A. O. L. ARE THERE OTHER UC'S R. C. S. USER COMMITTEE COLLEGES THAT ARE FACING SIMILAR- CHALLENGES- AND CAN YOU IDENTIFY- WHICH- WHICH THOSE ARE AWARE OF IN THE EXACT SAME POSITION AS A UC BERKELEY. WE DID ASK YOU NEED TO PROVIDE US ESTIMATES OF WHERE EACH CAMPUS'S RELATIVE TO THEIR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN THERE ARE TWO CAMPUSES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR STUDENT- ESTIMATES UNDER THEIR MOST RECENT LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS UCLA. AND UC SANTA BARBARA ARE SLIGHTLY OVER THEIR TARGETS WHEN IT COMES JUST TO THE STUDENT ENROLLMENT LEVELS. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TAKES OUT THE REFERENCE TO STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY AND- FOCUSES ON CAMPUS POPULATION AND SO NOT ONLY STUDENTS BUT FACULTY STAFF ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE CAMPUS NO UC CAMPUS AS AN EXCESS OF THEIR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN TOTAL CAMPUS POPULATION ESTIMATES. AND WE'RE NOT WE DID NOT ASK THAT- I'M SORRY WE ASK IN FOR AS YES USE SO I'M SORRY I CAN'T ANSWER THAT SPECIFICALLY IF THERE ARE SOME CSU CAMPUSES THAT ARE GETTING CLOSE TO THEIR MASTER PLAN ESTIMATES. BUT TO BE CLEAR THAT THESE- VISIONS DO APPLY TO USE PCS USE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALL HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS PUBLIC AT A PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. LAST OCTOBER FOR YOU REFERENCES AT PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION IS BROADLY DEFINED SO IT WOULD APPLY TO CAMPUSES AT ALL THREE PUBLIC STATEMENTS. AND MY LAST QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF THE ITS APPLICATIONS THE SEQUEL OR CHANGES OR NOT NO CHANGES WHAT WHAT IS YOUR ANALYSIS DOES THIS BILL. REVISED PHYSICAL PROVISIONS AYWAY OR IS SEEK. WORK LEFT. IN PLACE. I WONDER THE AS IT DOES CHANGE SOME OF THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS SO AND- RATHER THAN LOOKING AT. IN ENROLLMENT IN ISOLATION IT ALLOWS CAMPUSES TO LOOK AT THEIR TOTAL CAMPUS CONTEMPT POPULATION THAT IS SOMETHING THEY DO NOW- IT JUST GIVES THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO FOCUS. ON CAMPUS POPULATION WITHOUT HAVING TO SPOKE UP ON ANY SUB COMPONENT OF THEM WHEN IT COMES TO THE SECRET PROCESS IN ISOLATION AND ALSO CLARIFIES WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS A FINDING THAT THEY HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR CAMPUS POPULATION TOTALS. IT GIVES CAMPUSES THESE EIGHTEEN MONTH WINDOWS FOR THE COURT- FOR THEM TO REMEDY SITUATIONS WITHIN THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THE CAMPUS HAS TO TURN AWAY ANY STUDENTS. SO IT IS TRYING TO CLARIFY THAT THE SITUATION WENT MATERIALIZE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE CAMPUSES WHAT HAVE THE SET EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD SO YOU- UNDERTAKE MEDICATION. OKAY SO JUST TO BE CLEAR- THIS BILL REMOVES THAT THE ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS. IN THEIR- IN PLAN AND IF THEY ARE- EXCEEDING THE- THE- THE ENROLLMENT CAPS THEN ORG ENROLLMENT REQUIRED CRITERIA IT AND THEY HAVE EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO REMEDY THAT WERE TO DO ANOTHER IMPACT- AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. I THINK THAT'S BASICALLY IT RIGHT THE EIGHTEENTH MONTH WINDOW I THINK STARKS WHEN ANTS- IN CONNECTION TO A COURT CASE SO THAT THIS SPECIFIC INSTANCE BEFORE YOU CREDIT REMAINS URIEL MATERIALIZE OUT PRIOR TO LITIGATION CAMPUS AS CAN- BECAUSE WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT LIKE REGULAR C. CORPUS THAT THE WAY YOU SUMMARIZED IT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WILL JUST BE THIS DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME UNDER WHICH CAMPUSES MAY RESPOND. OKAY BUT ENROLLMENT LEVELS ARE NO LONGER SO THAT THAT ROMAN REMOVAL IS THAT IS THAT MINOR CHANGE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO UNDER SEQUEL. I'LL NOT SURE WHETHER YES HAVING A ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE BERKELEY COURT CASE WAS THAT ENROLLMENT COULD BE THE SOLE FACTOR TRIGGERING A SEQUEL OF REVIEW AND ENROLLMENT NOW IN ISOLATION WILL NOT BE SOMETHING THAT CAN TRIGGER THE DEFINITION OF A SEQUEL PROJECT NONSTICK WILL REFUSE WILL HAPPEN FOR ALL OF THE OTHER REASONS INCLUDING THINGS THAT WERE CAMPUS POPULATION IS EXCEEDING. AN ALLERGY THAT THE COURT MASTER PLAN TARGETS OKAY I APPRECIATE THANK YOU. I FORGOT I'M A WE'RE GONNA ALSO. SB 119% AT THE SAME TIME SO. NONE OF. THOSE MIGHT NOT ALSO MISSED WE WANT TO GO AHEAD WITH SB ONE NINETEEN AND THEN WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS ON OTHER ITEMS. YES MISTER CHAIR- I'M ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HERE TO PRESENT AN ESTIMATED NINETEEN WHICH IS A PLAN TO BUILD JUNIOR. THAT AMENDS THE CURRENT BUDGET ACT- THIS BILL RE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT COUNTIES EFFORTS TO UPGRADE OR REPLACE MONNING SYSTEM. ALLOWING COUNTIES TO CONTINUE SPENDING FUNDS THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION CYCLE- THE BILL ADDS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WILL PROVIDE THE COMMISSION. OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING OR POST WITH FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT EXISTING BONDS BETWEEN ITS PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT. THE CURRENT YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWO RELATING TO PEACE OFFICER CERTIFICATION- IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS BUDGET BUILDING WHICH ALSO REQUIRES NOTIFICATION TO THE GLVC BEFORE ANY FUNDS CAN BE TRANSFERRED. I'M THE ILL CORRECTS THE NAME OF A COW. CAN AND FINALLY INCLUDES OTHER TECHNICAL CHANGES TO CONTROL SECTIONS NINETEEN POINT FIVE SIX AND NINETEEN POINT SEVEN OF THE CURRENT BUDGET ACT- AND THAT IS IT I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS. WHERE DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS AS WELL. JUST COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND NO COMMENTS BY HRE IF YOU HAVE ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS FOR US THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO BACK TO MR FONG. MY ONE QUESTION TO THE PREMIER FINANCE IN TERMS OF THE- SB ONE NINETEEN. IS- WHAT IS THE URGENCY TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS- WHEN IT COMES SUPPOSED IS THERE A RATIONAL WHAT'S THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY IN STAFF TO THE DATE OF JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH- UNDER SB TWO- REQUIRES AGENCIES THAT ARE PLAYING PEACE OFFICERS TO TRANSMIT CERTAIN INFORMATION TO POST. AND SO POST IS- GETTING READY TO IMPLEMENT TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF NINETY SYSTEM TO ALLOW FOR THAT DATA TRANSFER. SO THAT DATE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN STATUTE IS WHAT'S DRIVING- THE CURRENT NEED. OKAY THE TO THE TO THE ELIO- IN TERMS OF. IT MADE IT IS NORMAL I GUESS OR MAYBE I'M TRYING UNDERSTAND- THE URGENCY HERE. I'M NOT SURE SO WHEN WE- AND REVIEWED HOPE CLOSE AS A- REQUEST FOR THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. I'M INCLUDING RESOURCES FOR- THE IT SYSTEM AS WELL AS OTHER ASPECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWO. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD NOTED IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH AND IS THAT THE TIME LINES- ARE PRETTY TIGHT FOR THEM IN PARTICULAR TO PROCURE THE JESUS DANCE. AND SINCE THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WORK IN THE CURRENT YEAR. TO PREPARE FOR INSTANCE IN THE BILL BASICALLY CHECK AFFECTING EVERYONE IN THIS YEAR BUT THERE IS A ONE YEAR DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION FOR THEM BEFORE THEY HAVE TO HAVE IT SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING. TO RECEIVE REPORTS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES- AND SO THEY'VE DONE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WORK TO- THAT BEACON THE PREPARATION FOR PROCURING THE EIGHTY SYSTEM AS WELL AS PUTTING PROCEDURES IN PLACE. AND SO AND IT APPEARED STAFF HOST MAYBE READY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PROCURING STARTING THE PROCUREMENT AND IT SYSTEMS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO. AND THERE WOULD BE A JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE NOTIFICATION WHEN RESTAURANTS ARE TRANSFERRED I'M AND THAT WOULD JUST ALLOW THEM TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY I'M AS AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE GETTING AND I. T. SYSTEM PROCURED AND IMPLEMENTED. WITHIN A SIX MONTH TIME FRAME THIS IS A PRETTY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. I'M SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS SURE WELL THE SAKE OF WINDOWS HAVE ISSUES WITH IT SYSTEMS AYE AYE I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT- TIMES OUT. IN WE'RE MOVING. UP FOR THE ONE SO IS THERE. TWO YEARS THAT THAT THAT POST IS READY BY OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT. YES RIGHT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THIS WOULD ALLOW AND I CAN DEFERRED A PERMANENT FINANCING THIS THIS WOULD JUST ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS THE FUNDING MORE QUICKLY. IF THEY ARE ABLE TO AND I THINK DEPARTMENT FINANCE MIGHT BE IN A BETTER POSITION BY THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD EARLIER IN THE YEAR WITH HOST ABIT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO EDGE HI CARE SOMETHING THAT'S RELATIVELY OFF THE SHELF- AND BY. GIVING A SPEECH YOU WENT INTO AFFECTED THIS JANUARY WIND BUT THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BY NEXT JANUARY ONE AND ADDS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE READY TO GO ON THE PROCUREMENT AND THAT SYSTEM ACCESSING THESE DOLLARS SOONER. WHEN A SYSTEM IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE IT UP AND RUNNING BY NEXT JANUARY FIRST IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATION. OKAY SO BACK TO THE FORMER FINANCE SO IS THAT SO THAT'S AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION EAT THIS THIS INFORMATION SYSTEM THIS IS THE SYSTEM'S GOING TO BE READY TO GO. BY JANUARY FIRST. OF TWENTY TWENTY. THREE YES AND AS MR MAN. THIS DOES GIVE THAT. AND I DID THREE. SO RATHER THAN IMPLEMENT STARTING JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO START THREE MONTHS EARLY SO AND- AND- THREE MONTHS- IN REGARDS TO PROCUREMENT WILL BE HELPFUL OR THE DEPARTMENT TO MEET THAT DATE OF JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK GONNA GO MISTER JUST WANTED TO COMMENT FURTHER ON THIS ACTION ITEM RELATED TO. SB ONE EIGHTEEN AND UC BERKELEY SO FIRST AND FOREMOST I THIN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL GET UNANIMOUS- EMBRACE ON THE FLOOR LATER ON TODAY IN THIS ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO TACKLE RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE. THOUSANDS OF QUALIFIED CALIFORNIANS ATTEMPTING TO ENROLL THE UC BERKELEY THIS FALL IN A LURCH AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BRING ABOUT A FIX AND- YOU KNOW SEQUEL EVERY FORMALLY TO HOUSING IS AN ELUSIVE ISSUE THAT ARE NOT TO RESOURCES CHAIR WOULD ALLUDE TO AND PEOPLE CAN STILL. LOOK AT THAT THAT'S KIND OF A LONGER TERM ISSUE THIS IS AN IMMEDIATE ISSUE HOW WE CAN FIX THE ISSUE AT UC BERKELEY- FULLY ENROLL STUDENTS THIS FALL AS WAS AS WAS PLANNED. AND THEN- TO YOUR QUESTION MISTER VICE CHAIR- FONG MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THIS IN PLACE SO WE DON'T HAVE ISSUES AND OTHER HIRING CAMPUS IS MAINLY UC CAMPUSES BUT ONE OR TWO- CS USE MAY HAVE THIS ISSUE IN CITIES WHERE THERE YOU KNOW THAT CONSTRAINT. WITH BUILDING NEW HOUSING AND HOW DO YOU KNOW ISSUES WITH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS CONCERNED ABOUT SUCH GROWTH- BUT THE BIG PICTURE HERE I THINK AND WE'RE GOING TO BE- S. THING WHERE THE- YEAR AS WELL. AS NEED BUILD MORE HOW. AND CAMPUSES YOU KNOW THAT'S THE FIGHT HERE- LAST YEAR WE PUT ASIDE TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD MORE COLLEGE HOUSING AT UCC ISSUED COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE A PUSH THIS YEAR FOR ANOTHER FIVE BILLION- THE IRONY HERE AT BERKELEY. WILL SAY IS THAT THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO BUILD MORE STUDENT HOUSING WHO WAS. ARGUED AGAINST BY THE SAME APPLICATION FILED THIS AGAINST THE ENROLLMENT INCREASE SO. YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT THE HOUSING BILLS AND THEN THEY SUED FOR MORE MOMENT BECAUSE NONE OF HOUSING SO- WHAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY KNOW THEIR TRUE TRUE PRIORITIES HERE AND THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW NIMBYS WHO DON'T WANT MORE- HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE KNOW SO KEY TO OUR- ECONOMIC FUTURE UPWARD MOBILITY FOR STUDENTS AND SO. OU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP. OUR EYES ON THE ON THE PRICE AND FOCUSING ON INCREASING ENROLLMENT AS WELL AS PROVIDING STUDENT HOUSING TO HELP CURRENT STUDENTS AS WELL AS- A FUTURE- POPULATION IN THESE CAMPUSES SO- THANK YOU TO. OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM ARE BUDGET CHAIR SPEAKER AND EVERYBODY IN OUR STAFF FOR COMING UP WITH THAT- THE SOLUTION WE CAN VOTE ON EMBRACE TODAY. AND. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. AT THE COMMISSION. WITH THREE. THANK YOU CHAIR- I WOULD THINK- BUT CHAIR AND OTHERS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN COMING UP- WITH THIS LEGISLATION YOU KNOW CLEARLY- AUTHORS ARE ATTEMPTING TO PUT THE INTEREST OF STUDENTS FIRST- AND I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I DON'T QUESTION OF THEIR GOOD INTENTIONS- YOU KNOW IF THE CONSEQUENCE. OF THE COURTS IN JUNCTION IS TO DENY INCOMING STUDENTS PARTICULARLY IN STATE STUDENTS. YOU KNOW THE SPOT THAT THEY EARNED AT UC BERKELEY WE SHOULD AVOID THAT WE ALL HAVE CONSTITUENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND BECAUSE OF OUR ACTION TODAY- THE STUDENTS THAT. SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO UC BERKELEY WILL BE ABLE TO BE ADMITTED BY THE UNIVERSITY HOWEVER. THAT CONSEQUENCE IN THIS CASE IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS OF SEEK WHAT THAT SEE WHAT REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT IN CLEAR AND REASONABLE IN FACT THESE REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. AND THEIR PURPOSE IS TO CLARIFY AND LIMIT UNIVERSITY SEQUEL OBLIGATIONS WHEN THEY ADOPT THEIR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS- IN FACT THE CONSEQUENCE IN THIS CASE IS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE UNIVERSITY DISREGARDING THE CLEAR REQUIREMENTS TO ANALYZE CHANGES IN ENROLLMENT. WITZIG WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AT UC BERKELEY DUE PRIMARILY TO THE UC'S DECISION TO EMPHASIZE ADMITTING OUT OF STATE STUDENTS LITIGATION RUN AMOK BUT A CASE WHERE UC BERKELEY DISREGARDED THE CLEAR LONGSTANDING REQUIREMENT TO PLAN FOR INCREASE ENROLLMENT. SO WHAT'S OUR SOLUTION YOU KNOW THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY REWARDS THE MISTAKES OF THE UC I BUT I HOPE THAT OTHER UNIVERSITIES WILL NOT COMMIT THESE MISTAKES AND PUT STUDENTS ADMISSIONS AT RISK. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LETTING THEM OFF THE HOOK FOR THIS. IS A BILL. YOU KNOW DOES NOT ACTUALLY SUBSTITUTE AN ANALYSIS OF CAMPUS POPULATION FOR ENROLLMENT WHAT IT DOES IS ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT TO ANALYZE ENROLLMENT CHANGES CREATING AN INCENTIVE TO UNDER STATE STUDENT NUMBERS TO REDUCE PLANNING AND MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS. I DON'T QUESTION THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHORS AND I APPRECIATE THAT THEY INVOLVED OTHER CHAIRS OF COMMITTEES WHOSE JURISDICTION IS UNDER SEEK WHAT. BUT THIS RUSH JOB UNFORTUNATELY IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD TO DO AND SKIPPED THE POLICY PROCESS AND REAL PUBLIC REVIEW AS A RESULT. I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DO FOR STUDENTS AND I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS- BUT IN THE FUTURE I BELIEVE THAT THIS. NEEDS MORE REVIEW POLICY REVIEW GOING THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS AND THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE WITH MYSTERY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. ON THIS ISSUE AND BRING THIS- MEASURED WITH SO QUICKLY. I IN FACT YOU KNOW I EVEN HAD CONSTITUENTS WITHIN MY OWN DISTRICT THAT WHEN FAMILIES ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE- UNPRECEDENTED CORPORAL UC BERKELEY. AND I THINK TODAY'S FIX WHILE OF COURSE THE BEGINNING OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- I NOT ONLY DOES IT IN FACT AFFECT. A PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS COMING UC BERKELEY BUT WE SAW THE TEEING UP OF LITIGATION AND OTHER USES LIKE SANTA BARBARA OR OTHER COASTAL. OR ANY A LOT OF OTHER SCHOOLS AND I AND MY CONSTITUENTS HAD WORRIED THAT THIS WILL REVERBERATE ACROSS THE SYSTEM. WHICH COULD BE GET NINE LOTS AND LOTS OF STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY AND EDUCATION AT OUR FINEST EDUCATION SOLUTIONS. I'M REALLY GLAD THAT THIS IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL OUR EDUCATION SOLUTIONS AND NOT JUST UC BERKELEY. BECAUSE REALLY IF WE ALLOW. THE WHIMS OF A MINORITY OF FOLKS IN THOSE TOWNS TO HOLD HOSTAGE THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIANS. WE DO HAVE A REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND I AGREE THAT THIS IS A GOOD. FIX IT BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE HAVING. BUT I'M REALLY GLAD THAT- WE'RE ABLE TAKE DECISIVE ACTION AND I REALLY WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT THIS HAS IMMEDIATE. ONE OF THE I THINK RARE TIMES IN THIS LEGISLATURE WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT AND BENEFIT TO FAMILIES WITH A CONSTITUENCY. ACT AS AGENTS ARE GOING TO BE VERY THANKFUL THAT WE'RE ABLE TO TAKE SUCH QUICK ACCESS SO I THANK YOU AGAIN- SEARCHING FOR YOUR QUICK ACTION ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO TO MYSTERON US. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS A MORE OF A COMMENT OVER THE WHOLE- UC SYSTEM I KNOW WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT CONTINUING HERE WITH UC BERKELEY AND SOME OF THE ONLINE- THINGS IN COURSES THAT WE'RE TALKING A BUT THERE WAS AN AUDIT THAT WAS DONE. ON THE UC SYSTEM THAT IDENTIFIED OVER. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS IN THOSE REMAINS ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS TO BE REPATRIATED BACK. SO I WANTED TO. MAKE SURE IN ENCOURAGE- AND MAKE SURE THE LEGISLATURE STILL KNOWS THAT THOSE REMAINS HAVE NOT BEEN TOTALLY- REPATRIATED BACK TO NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ON THESE TYPES OF A- REQUEST IN THESE TYPES OF ACTIONS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE ACTIONS OF REPATRIATING. NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS BACK TO THE RIGHT FOR PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THOSE ARE ONGOING PROCESSES AND WILL BE MONITORING THAT TO ENSURE THAT THAT CONTINUES TO MOVE. IN A FORWARD DIRECTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.
