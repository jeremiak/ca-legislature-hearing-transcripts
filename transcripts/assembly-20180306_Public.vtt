THE FIRE HOW THEY OBTAIN THE

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:54.926 region:rollup2

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:27.618 region:rollup2
OPTIONAL ON JOINDER. AND THIS IS

00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:30.188 region:rollup2
SIMPLY BE STATUTORY RAPE CHARGE

AS WELL AS FELONY SEXUAL BATTERY

00:41:30.188 --> 00:41:33.891 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN THE

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:35.059 region:rollup2
TRAUMA THAT THESE VICTIMS

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:36.995 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:38.730 region:rollup2
THESE CRIMES. AND THEN HAVE TO

00:41:36.995 --> 00:41:40.231 region:rollup2
TESTIFY IN COURT ABOUT THEM AND

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:41.666 region:rollup2
ALL WE'RE DOING IS GIVING THE

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:44.168 region:rollup2
OPTION OF INCLUDING THESE

00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:45.470 region:rollup2
VICTIMS. IN THE OPTION OF

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:47.338 region:rollup2
JOINING THEIR CASES AND JOINING

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:50.241 region:rollup2
THEIR CHARGES WHEN THE

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:50.808 region:rollup2
PERPETRATOR COMMITS THESE CRIMES

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:51.976 region:rollup2
ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL LINES

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:54.278 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW SEXUAL

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:55.813 region:rollup2
PERPETRATORS DON'T JUST COMMIT

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:57.648 region:rollup2
THEIR CRIMES AGAINST ONE VICTIM.

00:41:55.813 --> 00:42:00.284 region:rollup2
OR IN THE SAME JURISDICTION THEY

00:41:57.648 --> 00:42:01.052 region:rollup2
OFTEN CROSS JURISDICTIONAL

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:02.453 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

00:42:01.052 --> 00:42:05.223 region:rollup2
AND HAVE MULTIPLE VICTIMS AND

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:06.891 region:rollup2
SO THIS JUST GIVES THE OPTION OF

00:42:05.223 --> 00:42:08.559 region:rollup2
ADDING THOSE CHARGES TO GATHER

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:09.594 region:rollup2
AND JOINING THEM IN THE SAME

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:11.829 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION.

00:42:09.594 --> 00:42:13.598 region:rollup2
IF BOTH JURISDICTIONS AGREE.

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:15.133 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE JUDGE HAS TO AGREE

00:42:13.598 --> 00:42:16.801 region:rollup2
TO SO YOU STILL GO THROUGH A

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:18.069 region:rollup2
HEARING WHERE THE JUDGE HAS TO

00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:20.037 region:rollup2
APPROVE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:21.606 region:rollup2
IT'S FAIR TO ALL PARTIES. AND

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:23.808 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NO I'M IN THERE IS

00:42:21.606 --> 00:42:25.610 region:rollup2
NO UNDUE PREJUDICE TO ANY PARTY

00:42:23.808 --> 00:42:27.578 region:rollup2

00:54:15.786 --> 00:54:19.990 region:rollup2
A SIMPLE A SIMPLE FIX TO INCLUDE

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:21.625 region:rollup2
GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:23.093 region:rollup2
FROM THE OPTIONAL TENURE

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:25.295 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER. AND THAT'S

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:26.864 region:rollup2
ALL WE'RE SEEKING TO DO TODAY ON

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:28.365 region:rollup2
IS TO INCLUDE THESE BASIC GROUPS

00:54:26.864 --> 00:54:29.767 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE THE ADULT VICTIMS OF

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:31.502 region:rollup2
PIMPING PANDERING.

00:54:29.767 --> 00:54:33.771 region:rollup2
WHO ARE DESERVING AS OF MUCH

00:54:31.502 --> 00:54:35.339 region:rollup2
PROTECTION AS THE MINERS THAT

00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:36.774 region:rollup2
ARE BETTER PIMPIN PANDERED ON

00:54:35.339 --> 00:54:38.242 region:rollup2
THESE ADULT VICTIMS JUST BECAUSE

00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:39.843 region:rollup2
THEY TURN EIGHTEEN DOESN'T MEAN

00:54:38.242 --> 00:54:42.179 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT WORTHY OF THAT

00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:43.213 region:rollup2
PROTECTION? AND IT IS OPTIONAL

00:54:42.179 --> 00:54:44.081 region:rollup2
IT'S DISCRETIONARY OF TO THE

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.883 region:rollup2
JUDGE.

00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:48.952 region:rollup2
THEY NEED THE TIME TO GET AWAY

00:54:45.883 --> 00:54:51.522 region:rollup2
FROM THEIR PIMPS AND AS WE KNOW

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:53.090 region:rollup2
FROM THESE CASES. THESE PANTS

00:54:51.522 --> 00:54:55.159 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THEY'RE SENT TO PRISON%

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:58.695 region:rollup2
THEY OFTEN CONTINUE TO PIMP THEM

00:54:55.159 --> 00:55:02.299 region:rollup2
FROM PRISON OR WHEN THEY GET OUT

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:05.035 region:rollup2
OF PRISON SO THAT TENURE ORDER

00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:07.871 region:rollup2
WILL HELP PROTECT THEM TO GIVE

00:55:05.035 --> 00:55:09.840 region:rollup2
THEM THAT SPACE TO BE ABLE TO

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:13.577 region:rollup2
GET AWAY.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:14.111 region:rollup2
FROM THEIR ABUSER OR THEIR

00:55:13.577 --> 00:55:14.745 region:rollup2

00:55:15.546 --> 00:55:16.680 region:rollup2
I NOTICED THERE WAS AN

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:16.947 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION FILED REGARDING THOSE

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.548 region:rollup2
VICTIMS.

00:55:16.947 --> 00:55:18.215 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE

00:55:17.548 --> 00:55:18.816 region:rollup2
UNDESERVING OF THIS PROTECTION

00:55:18.215 --> 00:55:19.349 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING ARE

00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:20.117 region:rollup2

00:55:20.117 --> 00:55:23.420 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING WHO ARE DAY.

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:24.822 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MOSTLY IMMIGRANTS THAT

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.890 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING IN THE U. S. ON

00:55:24.822 --> 00:55:29.193 region:rollup2

00:55:30.227 --> 00:55:33.931 region:rollup2
THEY'VE EXPERIENCED SOME TYPE OF

MEMBERS.

00:55:45.576 --> 00:55:49.046 region:rollup2
SO I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY

00:55:47.578 --> 00:55:50.614 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE INCLUDED IN THIS AS

00:55:49.046 --> 00:55:52.082 region:rollup2
WELL JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:55:50.614 --> 00:55:53.217 region:rollup2

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:55.686 region:rollup2

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:13.430 region:rollup2
THE LAW WORKS ON THE THING SIDE.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.464 region:rollup2
THIS DOESN'T.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.432 region:rollup2
CHANGE OUT I DON'T THINK IT

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:17.767 region:rollup2
WOULD PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:18.368 region:rollup2
MOVING BACK MEAN WE DON'T WANT

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:18.535 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:20.370 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:22.238 region:rollup2
.

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:24.874 region:rollup2
FOR THE CASE OF PEOPLE THAT WERE

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:26.409 region:rollup2
LABOR TRAFFICKED WE ALSO NEED TO

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:27.544 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM WHERE APPROPRIATE.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.778 region:rollup2
AS SHE POINTED OUT IT'S AN

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:30.447 region:rollup2
OPTIONAL THING IT'S NOT

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.947 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC IN EVERY CASE BUT

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:32.115 region:rollup2
WHERE THE JUDGE FINDS AN

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:33.683 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:35.118 region:rollup2
FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS ENSLAVED

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:37.053 region:rollup2
AND BROUGHT SOMETIMES BROUGHT TO

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:39.222 region:rollup2
THIS COUNTRY AGAINST THEIR WILL.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:40.924 region:rollup2
AND IS IS EXPLOITED THEY NEED

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:42.125 region:rollup2
SOME TIME TO HEAL TO REBUILD

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:44.060 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES TO GET BACK ON THEIR

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:45.262 region:rollup2
FEET AND TO KNOW. IF IT'S

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.963 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE THAT FOR TEN YEARS

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.198 region:rollup2
THEY CANNOT BE CONTACTED BY THE

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:49.866 region:rollup2
PERSON THAT EXPLOIT.

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:51.568 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALWAYS SEEKING TO DO HERE

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:52.702 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A GOOD STEP FORWARD

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:54.604 region:rollup2

AUTOMATIC AT BECAUSE REALLY

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:10.954 region:rollup2

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.690 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THE ACLU THEN. IMPROPER

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.824 region:rollup2
USE THAT BECAUSE EACH CASE IS IS

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:16.960 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IS SEPARATE AND EACH

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:18.228 region:rollup2
ONE WRITTEN REQUIRES DIFFERENT.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.130 region:rollup2

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:02.965 region:rollup2
POINTS

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:05.668 region:rollup2
THE FIRST OF WHICH I THINK IS

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:07.336 region:rollup2
WRONG DAY HAD A BILL WANTS THAT.

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:08.738 region:rollup2
THE COP VETOED THAT.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:10.707 region:rollup2
SAYS JOHN SHOULD BE HELD TO A

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:12.708 region:rollup2
FELONY STANDARD I BELIEVE THAT'S

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:14.944 region:rollup2
TRUE THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY.

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:18.247 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HOLD RESPONSIBLE

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:20.550 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE SECOND POINT IS ONE

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:21.751 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK I'M. I'M MORE

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:24.721 region:rollup2

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:06.775 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO THEM IS BASICALLY. TO

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:08.143 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF GUNS OUT

01:19:06.775 --> 01:19:09.445 region:rollup2
THERE WHETHER IT'S GUNS IN

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:10.479 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY'S HOUSE THAT THEY'RE

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:11.480 region:rollup2
NOT USING WHETHER IT'S BROKEN

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:13.716 region:rollup2
GUNS WHETHER IT'S LEGAL GUNS ON

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.452 region:rollup2
THE STREET. IT IS A DON'T ASK

01:19:13.716 --> 01:19:17.720 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS TURNING GUNS.

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:19.088 region:rollup2
I'M IN MY DISTRICT.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.589 region:rollup2
WHILE THESE GUNS WERE BEING

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:22.658 region:rollup2
TURNED AND THEY WERE GETTING

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:25.094 region:rollup2
GIFT CARDS FOR A RETAILER'S.

01:19:22.658 --> 01:19:27.029 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THAT SOLD GUNS AND

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:28.264 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION AND IT'S JUST A

01:19:27.029 --> 01:19:30.132 region:rollup2
COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT I

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:31.166 region:rollup2
THINK IF OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:32.901 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF GUNS THROUGH GUN

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:34.937 region:rollup2
BUY BACK PROGRAMS THAT WE DON'T

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:37.873 region:rollup2
THEN. I TURN AROUND AND GIVE A

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:39.675 region:rollup2
GIFT CARD TO A DEALER OF GUNS OR

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:41.844 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION SO IT'S COMMON SENSE

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:43.479 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:45.981 region:rollup2
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE.

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:47.316 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:50.986 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER WITH ANY WITNESSES AND

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:52.554 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:55.190 region:rollup2
HOW YOU DOING?

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:58.961 region:rollup2
THE MAN WITH THE NEW BEARD.

01:19:55.190 --> 01:20:00.462 region:rollup2
I MEAN HERE.

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:01.096 region:rollup2
HOW I WISH CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.498 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE CRAIG TO LOSE ON

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:05.100 region:rollup2
BEHALF OF THE FIREARMS POLICY

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:05.934 region:rollup2
COALITION? YOU OFTENTIMES WE SEE

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.736 region:rollup2
THESE MEASURES.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.771 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED IN THERE CALLED

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:09.371 region:rollup2
COMMON SENSE

01:20:08.771 --> 01:20:15.377 region:rollup2
AND THE THE FIREARM INTO SURE

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:16.945 region:rollup2
FIREARMS

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:18.447 region:rollup2
CULTURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.981 region:rollup2
THESE BILLS HAVE LITTLE TO NO

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:20.549 region:rollup2
IMPACT ACTUALLY SHOULD BE

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:21.884 region:rollup2
DEEMED.

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:24.019 region:rollup2
AS COMMON NONSENSE

01:20:21.884 --> 01:20:26.155 region:rollup2
A THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE ARISES

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:27.389 region:rollup2
BECAUSE GIVE CARDS TO WALMART

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:28.524 region:rollup2
WHICH BY THE WAY DOES NOT SELL

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:30.859 region:rollup2
FIREARMS IN THE STATE OF

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:32.027 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER DO SELL IN

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:33.362 region:rollup2
SOME PLACES THEY DO SELL

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:35.764 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION.

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:36.999 region:rollup2
THE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:38.167 region:rollup2
WITH THIS FIRST OF ALL IT'S JUST

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:39.735 region:rollup2
THE THEY AND I THINK EVERYONE

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:41.337 region:rollup2
CAN AGREE THERE'S QUESTIONS AS

01:20:39.735 --> 01:20:43.439 region:rollup2
TO WHETHER OR NOT. A GUN BUY

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:44.973 region:rollup2
BACK PROGRAMS WORK WILL MAYBE

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:46.575 region:rollup2
THERE ARE I I KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:47.543 region:rollup2
ENOUGH INFORMATION AS IS

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:49.478 region:rollup2
PROVIDED IN OUR LETTER THAT

01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:50.646 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATES THEY ARE NOT IN

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:51.880 region:rollup2
FACT EFFECTIVE.

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:52.881 region:rollup2
BUT THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.450 region:rollup2
HAVE WITH GUN BUY BACK PROGRAMS

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:56.919 region:rollup2
IT IS LITERALLY A WAY FOR

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:57.920 region:rollup2
CRIMINALS TO DISPOSE OF FIREARMS

01:20:56.919 --> 01:20:59.288 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN USED IN THE

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.725 region:rollup2
COMMISSION OF A CRIME. WITH

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:04.093 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NO CONSEQUENCES AND

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:05.260 region:rollup2
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:06.929 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE AT

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:08.597 region:rollup2
THE VERY LEAST BE AMENDED TO

01:21:06.929 --> 01:21:10.199 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THE RECORDING OF

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:11.567 region:rollup2
SIGNATURES OUR SIGNATURE OF

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:13.102 region:rollup2
SERIAL NUMBERS AND INFORMATION

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:14.536 region:rollup2
BALLISTICS INFORMATION ON THESE

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:16.205 region:rollup2
FIREARMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:17.840 region:rollup2
NOT THEY ARE INVOLVED. THEY HAD

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:19.641 region:rollup2
BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY CRIME BUT

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.976 region:rollup2
WITH THAT ONCE AGAIN THE IDEA

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:23.045 region:rollup2
PUTTING GOVERNMENT MONEY INTO

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:25.381 region:rollup2
PUT INTO A PROGRAM. OF THAT IS

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:27.483 region:rollup2
GOING THAT IS ALLOWS FOR.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:28.117 region:rollup2
WEAPONS THAT ARE USED IN THE

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:29.651 region:rollup2
COMMISSION OF A CRIME IS JUST.

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:31.320 region:rollup2
LUDICROUS

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:32.287 region:rollup2
ALL IN THE GUISE OF SAYING WELL

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.989 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO.

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:35.057 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WE WANT TO REDUCE THE

01:21:33.989 --> 01:21:36.358 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF GUNS AND WE DON'T WANT

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:37.426 region:rollup2
TO PUT AN IMAGE OUT THERE THAT

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:39.194 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORT.

01:21:37.426 --> 01:21:41.196 region:rollup2
FIREARMS WILL LET'S JUST BE

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:42.431 region:rollup2
CLEAR OTHER THAN THOSE WHO SELL

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:43.899 region:rollup2
THE FIREARMS THE NUMBER ONE

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:44.700 region:rollup2
PROFITEER ARE THE NUMBER ONE

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:46.502 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT RECEIVED THE MOST

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:48.070 region:rollup2
RESOURCES FROM GUN SALES AND

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.937 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION SALES. IS THE

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.239 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THE NUMBER ONE

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:52.207 region:rollup2
PURCHASER IN THE STATE OF

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:53.809 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA OF FIREARMS AND

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:55.444 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION IS THE GOVERNMENT.

01:21:53.809 --> 01:21:57.112 region:rollup2
SO IT IF WE WANT TO.

01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:58.547 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THE AMOUNT

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.782 region:rollup2
OF AMMUNITION THE AMOUNT OF

01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:01.049 region:rollup2
FIREARMS THAT ARE OUT THERE IF

01:21:59.782 --> 01:22:03.285 region:rollup2
WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO PROMOTE

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:04.453 region:rollup2
FIREARMS THEN MAYBE IT OUGHT NOT

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:05.821 region:rollup2
BE A BUSINESS THAT THE STATE OF

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:08.023 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:22:05.821 --> 01:22:09.958 region:rollup2
PROFIT FROM AND PARTICIPATE IN.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:10.492 region:rollup2
IS WITH THIS THAT WE ARE OPPOSE

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.193 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE UNLESS IT IS

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:13.595 region:rollup2
AMENDED THANK YOU.

01:22:11.193 --> 01:22:14.396 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MR DELUDE.

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:17.499 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:18.066 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:20.035 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:23.539 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:24.306 region:rollup2
HEARING THE.

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:25.874 region:rollup2
WITNESS TO QUELL THERE IS ONE

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:28.877 region:rollup2
THING I HEARD WHICH IS SHOULD WE

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:31.413 region:rollup2
BE. GETTING SERIAL NUMBERS WHEN

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:33.015 region:rollup2
WE BUY BACK GUNS AND OTHERWISE

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:36.285 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THEY HAVE BEEN USED

01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:37.886 region:rollup2
IN A CRIME. I'M NOT QUITE SURE

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:39.321 region:rollup2
THE EFFICACY OF THAT BUT.

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:41.123 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT SURE EITHER OKAY LIKE

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:42.691 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO BE CLEAR I I AM NOT

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:45.527 region:rollup2
HERE I DID NOT CREATE THIS

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:47.162 region:rollup2
PROGRAM I HAVE MIXED EMOTIONS

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:49.064 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE GUN BUY BACK PROGRAM

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:51.633 region:rollup2
BUT. HAVING SEEN THEM.

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:52.901 region:rollup2
IN MY COMMUNITY I KNOW GUNS ARE

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:55.103 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TURNED IN IN A WIDE

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:57.206 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF GUNS THINGS THAT ARE

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:58.841 region:rollup2
CLEARLY BROKE AND THINGS THAT

01:22:57.206 --> 01:23:00.442 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE NORMAL YOU KNOW. AT A

01:22:58.841 --> 01:23:02.311 region:rollup2
HANDGUN AND A HOUSE THAT

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:03.879 region:rollup2
PROBABLY JUST IT'S BEEN SITTING

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:06.248 region:rollup2
THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS.

01:23:03.879 --> 01:23:07.583 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT A MOTHER FINDS THAT

01:23:06.248 --> 01:23:09.251 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE THEIR SON HAD AND

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:11.553 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T WANNA GET THEIR SON

01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:12.888 region:rollup2
IN TROUBLE. OR DAUGHTER ON THAT

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:14.990 region:rollup2
THEY FOUND IN THE CLOSET THERE'S

01:23:12.888 --> 01:23:17.493 region:rollup2
NO OTHER WAY TO GET RID OF THIS

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:19.595 region:rollup2
KIND LEGALLY SO I'M GONNA I'M

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:21.163 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA COME DOWN AND SAY IF

01:23:19.595 --> 01:23:23.031 region:rollup2
WE'RE TAKING GUNS OFF THE STREET

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:24.800 region:rollup2
I'M FOR. I'M FOR IT I'M FOR

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:26.168 region:rollup2
TAKING GUNS OUT OF SOMEBODY'S

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.670 region:rollup2
HOUSE THAT DOESN'T USE IT NO KID

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:32.241 region:rollup2
FINDS IT BLOWS HIS BRAINS OUT

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:32.574 region:rollup2
ONE KID IF WE SAY ONE KID I'M

01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:33.709 region:rollup2
FOR ITS GOOD.

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:34.343 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA DO THAT.

01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:35.244 region:rollup2
AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I READ A

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:36.612 region:rollup2
STUDY.

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:37.212 region:rollup2
OUT OF MY MISERY THE UNIVERSITY

01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:38.213 region:rollup2
MISSOURI.

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:39.147 region:rollup2
WHERE PROFESSOR WENT TO A ST

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:39.781 region:rollup2
LOUIS BY BACK AND THEY WERE

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:40.649 region:rollup2
GIVING CASH ABOUT ONE AND WE'LL

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.483 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH THAT LATER?

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:43.685 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS JUST ABOUT THE THAT.

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:44.720 region:rollup2
THE GIFTCARDS BUT AT THAT ONE HE

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.687 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWED PEOPLE AND ASK WHAT

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.656 region:rollup2
THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH THEIR

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:48.290 region:rollup2
CASH IN A NUMBER OF THOSE FOLKS

01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:49.291 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BUY A NEW.

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:51.360 region:rollup2
PAM.

01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:52.561 region:rollup2
SO AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.129 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND SOMETHING THAT WE

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.497 region:rollup2
SHOULD ADDRESS BUT WHAT IT WAS

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:57.432 region:rollup2
SO OBVIOUS WALMART IS THE

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:58.634 region:rollup2
LARGEST RETAILER ITEM IN GUNS IN

01:23:57.432 --> 01:24:00.035 region:rollup2
THE NATION. THEY DO SELL

01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:01.303 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:03.505 region:rollup2
JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT OUR

01:24:01.303 --> 01:24:05.274 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER DOLLARS WOULD ENCOURAGE

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:06.108 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY TO GO TO A RETAILER

01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:08.844 region:rollup2
THAT SELLS COMES IN AND OR

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:09.411 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION AND SO THAT'S. THE

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:11.580 region:rollup2
NARROW FOCUS OF THIS BILL.

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:13.849 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:15.250 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMIC.

01:24:13.849 --> 01:24:16.451 region:rollup2
YOU MAY CLOSE I JUST WANNA CLOSE

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:18.553 region:rollup2
BY SAYING I RESPECTFULLY

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:20.822 region:rollup2
DISAGREE WITH THE OPPONENT WHO

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:22.124 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS I GUESS THAT OUR LAW

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:24.126 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT SHOULD HAVE GUNS

01:24:22.124 --> 01:24:25.861 region:rollup2
UMPS OUT WITHOUT THAT. I DON'T

THIS LEGISLATION BUILDS UPON

EXISTING LAW.

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:50.065 region:rollup2

THE DOG DOES NOT DIMINISH SIMPLY

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:14.289 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A HANDLER DECIDES TO

ADDITIONALLY CURRENT LAW ALLOWS

PEARL THE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:44:12.847 --> 01:44:16.016 region:rollup2
THESE INCENTIVES WILL BE

01:44:14.148 --> 01:44:18.419 region:rollup2
INHERENTLY LESS AT RISK TO

PUBLIC SAFETY. TO BEGIN WITH.

01:44:18.419 --> 01:44:20.921 region:rollup2
AND THEY WILL ALSO REDUCE THEIR

01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:21.689 region:rollup2
RISK AS THEY EARN COLLEGE

TIME OFF ROLE.

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:29.830 region:rollup2
THIS WILL ALLOW PAROLE AGENTS TO

01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:32.099 region:rollup2
FOCUS THEIR LIMITED TIME AND

01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:33.601 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ON THE SMALL NUMBER OF

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:35.603 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO POSE A GREATER RISK

01:44:33.601 --> 01:44:37.104 region:rollup2
TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:44:35.603 --> 01:44:39.140 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT

01:44:37.104 --> 01:44:39.673 region:rollup2
CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISION OF

LOWER RISK PEOPLE IS AN

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:43.177 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE. A WASTE OF RESOURCES

01:44:42.343 --> 01:44:44.712 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY CAUSES WORSE

01:44:43.177 --> 01:44:46.247 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

01:44:44.712 --> 01:44:47.681 region:rollup2

DETAILED STUDIES IN TWO OF THOSE

01:45:14.175 --> 01:45:17.611 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT THE NEW LAWS WERE

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:18.212 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING THEIR INTENDED IMPACT

01:45:25.452 --> 01:45:28.088 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS EVEN IMPLEMENTED

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:29.657 region:rollup2
A VERSION OF THIS

01:45:28.088 --> 01:45:31.292 region:rollup2
UNDER AB ONE ON NINE PEOPLE

BUT ARE NOW UNDER PROBATION.

01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:38.265 region:rollup2

ARRESTS.

01:45:45.439 --> 01:45:49.210 region:rollup2
AND NOW CALIFORNIA CAN IMPROVE

01:45:47.408 --> 01:45:50.878 region:rollup2
UPON THIS EFFECTIVE PRACTICE AND

01:45:49.210 --> 01:45:52.913 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE PAROLEES NOT ONLY TO

01:45:50.878 --> 01:45:54.882 region:rollup2
REFRAIN FROM CRIME BUT TO

01:45:54.882 --> 01:45:57.218 region:rollup2

AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN ENTRANCE

01:46:10.164 --> 01:46:14.268 region:rollup2
THAT THE ALL PRISON SYSTEMS

01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:16.370 region:rollup2
SERVE CLOSE TO EIGHTEEN YEARS.

01:46:14.268 --> 01:46:17.738 region:rollup2
AND IT BECAME REALLY REAL FOR ME

01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:19.840 region:rollup2
WHEN I EARNED A RELEASE STATES

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:20.841 region:rollup2
THAT I WAS COMING HOME.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.444 region:rollup2
I WAS WELL AWARE OF THE

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:24.945 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES I WAS GOING TO FACE.

01:46:23.444 --> 01:46:26.947 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY FACING THOSE

01:46:24.945 --> 01:46:27.548 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES I DIDN'T KNOW TO BE

01:46:26.947 --> 01:46:28.816 region:rollup2
QUITE DIFFICULT BUT THEY HAVE

01:46:27.548 --> 01:46:31.352 region:rollup2
BEEN.

01:46:28.816 --> 01:46:32.653 region:rollup2
I PAROLED CLOSE TO OVER THREE

01:46:31.352 --> 01:46:33.354 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILES AWAY FOR MY FAMILY

01:46:32.653 --> 01:46:35.956 region:rollup2

01:46:33.354 --> 01:46:36.523 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I HAD TO.

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:38.492 region:rollup2
TO START A NEW LIFE TO START

01:46:36.523 --> 01:46:39.493 region:rollup2

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:40.761 region:rollup2
TO THIS DAY I CAN VISIT MY

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:42.863 region:rollup2
FAMILY BECAUSE I CAN'T TRAVEL

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:44.265 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF FIFTY MILES.

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:45.666 region:rollup2
REST ASSURED I HAVE PERMISSION

01:46:44.265 --> 01:46:46.867 region:rollup2

BE HERE.

01:46:52.406 --> 01:46:55.743 region:rollup2
THOSE BARRIERS AND OTHERS MAKE

01:46:54.275 --> 01:46:58.712 region:rollup2
IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO

01:46:55.743 --> 01:46:59.980 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY DISCHARGE PAROLE.

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:01.348 region:rollup2
AT TIMES YOU HAVE TO DECIDE

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:02.917 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU WANT TO WORK FULL

01:47:01.348 --> 01:47:04.618 region:rollup2
TIME OR TRY TO ADVANCE TO

01:47:02.917 --> 01:47:05.786 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL DEGREE BY GOING BACK

01:47:04.618 --> 01:47:10.758 region:rollup2
TO SCHOOL.

01:47:05.786 --> 01:47:12.026 region:rollup2
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO BOTH.

01:47:10.758 --> 01:47:13.494 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SOMEBODY

01:47:12.026 --> 01:47:15.429 region:rollup2
LIKE MYSELF TO EARN EARLIER

01:47:13.494 --> 01:47:16.263 region:rollup2
DISCHARGE.

01:47:15.429 --> 01:47:17.631 region:rollup2
IT'LL GIVE ME THAT SENSE OF

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:19.133 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT I HAVE DONE

01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:20.734 region:rollup2
THIS ON MY OWN.

01:47:19.133 --> 01:47:22.670 region:rollup2
IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOAL TO REACH

01:47:20.734 --> 01:47:24.939 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THIS WILL PROVIDE A A

01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:26.373 region:rollup2
GOAL ORIENTED APPROACH ON PAROLE

01:47:24.939 --> 01:47:27.274 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE CAN.

01:47:26.373 --> 01:47:30.611 region:rollup2
EARNED THAT THIS SHOW YOU SAY

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:31.845 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT I ACCOMPLISHED.

01:47:30.611 --> 01:47:33.714 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S IS OF A CONSUMMATE

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:35.816 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHMENT GOES A LONG WAY

01:47:33.714 --> 01:47:38.485 region:rollup2
EVEN AFTER THAT.

01:47:35.816 --> 01:47:40.454 region:rollup2
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL.

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:42.122 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH MY DISCHARGE A PRO IS

01:47:40.454 --> 01:47:44.425 region:rollup2
NOT FOR CERTAIN BECAUSE I AM ON

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:46.360 region:rollup2
LIFETIME PAROLE.

01:47:44.425 --> 01:47:48.562 region:rollup2
THIS BILL BECOMES A GOAL THAT

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.897 region:rollup2
CAN REACH FOR A TAKE CHARGE OF

01:47:48.562 --> 01:47:51.432 region:rollup2
AND WORK HARDER TOWARDS.

01:47:49.897 --> 01:47:53.500 region:rollup2
THESE INCENTIVES AND REWARDS

01:47:51.432 --> 01:47:54.935 region:rollup2
GIVE SUBSTANCE TO THE REASONS I

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:56.270 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE THIS CHARGE.

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:56.804 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL

01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:58.806 region:rollup2
