SEE THAT ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:10.858

ALONE IN IN THE CONGO SO THE

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:02.136
BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T KNOW HOW

MANY KIDS -- REALLY ARE WORKING

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:05.639

MAKE HEADWAY IN THIS AREA APPLE

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:31.031
IS CERTAINLY -- HAVING A GOT A

01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:33.467

BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN DO MORE SO --

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:40.774
I KNOW THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:42.343

01:39:55.789 --> 01:39:57.424

01:40:04.865 --> 01:40:07.267
WHICH IS GREAT BUT WE CANNOT DO

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:10.137

WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE FRIENDLY

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:21.815
TO HUMANS AS WELL AND JUST

01:40:21.882 --> 01:40:23.484
BECAUSE THEY'RE A WORLD AWAY.

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:24.818

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:22.015
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION.

THE VEHICLE -- YES OUR OUR

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:51.712

AND AND THERE'S A BIT OF A

01:46:00.887 --> 01:46:02.389
DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT DESERVE

WAY WE'RE GETTING THERE.

01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:29.829

AND WHAT THE WHAT THE BILL ENDS

02:24:17.415 --> 02:24:19.083
WITH I THINK FROM OUR

02:24:19.150 --> 02:24:21.386
PERSPECTIVE IS ESSENTIALLY WAY

02:24:21.452 --> 02:24:23.888

02:24:30.361 --> 02:24:32.263
TO MANDATE THAT IN THE LAW WE

02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:33.464
THINK IS PROBLEMATIC.

02:24:33.531 --> 02:24:34.932
WHY DO I THINK IT'S A MANDATE

02:24:34.999 --> 02:24:36.567
THE END OF THE BILL THE STATE

02:24:36.634 --> 02:24:40.271

THE REBATE LEVELS CAN BE PHASE

02:24:43.241 --> 02:24:44.008
DOWN.

02:24:44.075 --> 02:24:45.810
IN INCREMENTS BASED ON

02:24:45.877 --> 02:24:47.812
CUMULATIVE SALES LEVELS.

02:24:47.879 --> 02:24:49.747
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT THE THE

02:24:49.814 --> 02:24:51.916
REBATE SHALL BE FAILURES DOWN IT

02:24:51.983 --> 02:24:54.185
SAYS THAT OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND

02:24:54.252 --> 02:24:55.987
OTHER CREDIT CRITERIA SHALL BE

02:24:56.054 --> 02:24:58.956
ADOPTED. TO MAKE SURE WE CAN

02:24:59.023 --> 02:25:00.892
PHASE THOSE THINGS DOWN.

02:25:00.958 --> 02:25:03.761
SO WHAT ARE WE ADOPTING AND NEW

02:25:03.828 --> 02:25:05.396

ALL OF THEM MOST OF OUR CAR

03:06:02.784 --> 03:06:04.286
MAKERS KNOW HOW TO DO.

03:06:04.353 --> 03:06:05.921
IT -- TO THE TURN ON THAT THE

03:06:05.988 --> 03:06:06.421

03:06:12.294 --> 03:06:14.963
ENGINEERING CHANGER TO SIGN.

03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:16.698
AND I AM REALLY HOPING THAT THE

03:06:16.765 --> 03:06:18.767
PRIVATE SECTOR CAN MOVE A LITTLE

03:06:18.834 --> 03:06:18.934
BIT.

03:06:19.001 --> 03:06:20.636
FASTER THAN OURS THE GOOD THE

03:06:20.702 --> 03:06:22.371
GOOD GOVERNMENT AND AND I'M NOT

03:06:22.437 --> 03:06:24.206

03:06:24.273 --> 03:06:25.140
THIS.

03:06:25.207 --> 03:06:26.975
AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE

03:06:27.042 --> 03:06:30.012
THIS IS ALREADY A CANADIAN LAW.

03:06:30.078 --> 03:06:33.715
I THINK THE THE ANY HARDER STILL

03:06:33.782 --> 03:06:35.684
THE MOVE. TO BE SOLD IN CANADA

03:06:35.751 --> 03:06:39.688
WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS --

03:06:39.755 --> 03:06:42.024
AND THE HEADLIGHTS AND AND HELL

03:06:42.090 --> 03:06:43.992

03:06:47.062 --> 03:06:48.630
PALE PRETTY MUCH YEAH THAT'S

03:06:48.697 --> 03:06:50.432
COMING LINE WHAT WAS THE TIMING

03:06:50.499 --> 03:06:52.200
FOR THE CANADIAN BILL TO TAKE

03:06:52.267 --> 03:06:56.638

03:06:56.705 --> 03:06:57.172
TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN I DO

03:06:57.239 --> 03:07:01.310
BELIEVE THIS IS A IS A ADORABLE.

03:07:01.376 --> 03:07:11.453
AND AGAIN I'LL ASK FOR YOUR

03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:15.557
SUPPORT.

03:07:15.624 --> 03:07:16.224
I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING YOUR

03:07:16.291 --> 03:07:17.526
BILL TODAY COULD AND UNITED HAVE

03:07:17.593 --> 03:07:18.026
THAT DISCUSSION.

03:07:18.093 --> 03:07:19.695
OF I BELIEVE MOTOR VEHICLE STACY

03:07:19.761 --> 03:07:22.264
SAFETY STANDARDS SHOULD BE UP TO

03:07:22.331 --> 03:07:23.532
NHTSA NOW -- ONE OF THE THINGS

03:07:23.599 --> 03:07:24.733
THAT YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE

03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:26.501
C. H. P. -- WE DID TRY TO ADD

03:07:26.568 --> 03:07:27.502
OFFICERS LEISURE TO AID IN THAT

03:07:27.569 --> 03:07:28.904
BUT IT WAS VETOED BY THE

03:07:28.971 --> 03:07:30.105
GOVERNOR -- ACTUAL IS FOUR

03:07:30.172 --> 03:07:30.706
HUNDRED EIGHTY OFFICERS OVER

03:07:30.772 --> 03:07:31.840
FOUR YEARS -- BUT THAT WAS --

03:07:31.907 --> 03:07:33.041
NOT CONSIDERED IMPORTANT.

03:07:33.108 --> 03:07:34.509
THE OTHER THING IS IS WHEN YOU

03:07:34.576 --> 03:07:36.612
TALK ABOUT HOPING IN RELYING ON

03:07:36.678 --> 03:07:38.614
CONGRESS.

03:07:38.680 --> 03:07:40.315
I WOULD NOT RELY ON ME EITHER.

03:07:40.382 --> 03:07:43.018
SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN IN

03:07:43.085 --> 03:07:45.087

03:07:45.153 --> 03:07:47.522
AS A COURTESY TO YOU AND RESPECT

03:07:47.589 --> 03:07:48.724

03:20:56.844 --> 03:20:58.045
LOCAL JURISDICTION TO SAY YOU

03:20:58.112 --> 03:20:58.846
CAN'T RIDE SCOOTERS ON THE

03:20:58.913 --> 03:21:00.148
SIDEWALK YOU CAN ONLY BE A

03:21:00.214 --> 03:21:01.649
PROTECTED LANES.

03:21:01.716 --> 03:21:04.519
IT DOES GIVE A WIDE -- BIRTH TO

03:21:04.585 --> 03:21:06.454
LOCALITIES TO HAVE THE SCOOTERS

03:21:06.521 --> 03:21:08.055
WORK FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND

03:21:08.122 --> 03:21:09.690
WAYS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE SAFE

03:21:09.757 --> 03:21:12.093
FOR PEOPLE -- SO WE TRY TO

03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:14.829
REALLY BALANCE THE ABILITY FOR

03:21:14.896 --> 03:21:17.698
LOCALITIES TO REGULATE SCOOTERS --

03:21:17.765 --> 03:21:19.200
WITH YOU KNOW TRYING TO

03:21:19.267 --> 03:21:20.134
ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME UP WITH

03:21:20.201 --> 03:21:21.569
THOSE REGULATIONS BECAUSE A LOT

03:21:21.636 --> 03:21:22.670
OF THEM JUST AREN'T AND THAT'S

03:21:22.737 --> 03:21:24.939
PROBLEMATIC -- AND SORT OF JUST

03:21:25.006 --> 03:21:25.807
SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE NOT

03:21:25.873 --> 03:21:26.774
GONNA HAVE ANY SCOOTERS IN OUR

03:21:26.841 --> 03:21:28.376
COMMUNITY WHERE IT RIGHT YOU

03:21:28.443 --> 03:21:30.244
KNOW YOU CAN REALLY HAVE.

03:21:30.311 --> 03:21:32.580
PROBLEMS WITH -- YOU KNOW THE

03:21:32.647 --> 03:21:33.981
THE SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE

03:21:34.048 --> 03:21:36.350
RENTS A SCOOTER AND WON CITY AND

03:21:36.417 --> 03:21:37.618
IS THE WRITING INTO THE NEXT ALL

03:21:37.685 --> 03:21:38.853
OF A SUDDEN THINGS RADICALLY

03:21:38.920 --> 03:21:40.421
CHANGE THE MACHINE JUST STOPS

03:21:40.488 --> 03:21:41.589
WORKING ARE ALL OF A SUDDEN

03:21:41.656 --> 03:21:42.623
YOU'RE NO IN AND FLAT OUT THE

03:21:42.690 --> 03:21:44.258
LEGAL ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT ANY

03:21:44.325 --> 03:21:45.660
NOTICE FOR THE USERS.

03:21:45.726 --> 03:21:46.627
WE WANTED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT

03:21:46.694 --> 03:21:48.463
GAVE SOME BASIC FRAMEWORK BUT

03:21:48.529 --> 03:21:50.798
STILL GAVE THE LOCALITIES A LOT

03:21:50.865 --> 03:21:52.400
OF LEEWAY TO REGULATE.

03:21:52.467 --> 03:21:53.568
I'M HOW THIS TUTORED SCOOTERS

03:21:53.634 --> 03:21:54.368
ARE GOING TO WORK IN THEIR

03:21:54.435 --> 03:21:55.937
COMMUNITY SO WE ARE AND WE'RE

03:21:56.003 --> 03:21:57.338
CONTINUING TO DISCUSS.

03:21:57.405 --> 03:21:58.739
THAT WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES

03:21:58.806 --> 03:21:59.740
AND AND YOU KNOW WE'RE HAPPY TO

03:21:59.807 --> 03:22:01.342
TALK WITH ANY OF THE CITIES THAT

03:22:01.409 --> 03:22:03.411
HAVE CONCERNS TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:22:03.478 --> 03:22:04.645
WE ALLOW.

03:22:04.712 --> 03:22:05.613
THEM TO HAVE THE CAN SPLIT THE

03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:06.747
SCOOTERS IN A WAY THAT'S

03:22:06.814 --> 03:22:07.748
COMFORTABLE FOR THEM AND THAT

03:22:07.815 --> 03:22:09.584
SAY FOR THE COMMUNITY -- BUT WE

03:22:09.650 --> 03:22:11.085
NEED TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:22:11.152 --> 03:22:12.820
HAVE SOME ABILITY TO HAVE A

03:22:12.887 --> 03:22:13.754
STATEWIDE REGULATION THE SAME

03:22:13.821 --> 03:22:14.889
WAY THAT WE DO WITH BICYCLES AND

03:22:14.956 --> 03:22:16.624
WITH CARS AND ANY OTHER VEHICLE

03:22:16.691 --> 03:22:18.392
WHERE WE DON'T TO FOR A 100% TO

03:22:18.459 --> 03:22:19.894
LOCALITIES WE HAVE SOME OVER

03:22:19.961 --> 03:22:22.663
ARCHING -- REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:23.498
AND THEN THEY CAN OPERATE WITHIN

03:22:23.564 --> 03:22:25.132
THAT SO THIS IS REALLY IT'S

03:22:25.199 --> 03:22:26.634
ISN'T TO NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

03:22:26.701 --> 03:22:28.269
YOU KNOW BEING VERY QUICKLY AND

03:22:28.336 --> 03:22:29.504
RAPIDLY.

03:22:29.570 --> 03:22:31.305
DEPLOYED ACROSS THE STATE AND WE

03:22:31.372 --> 03:22:32.340
THINK IT'S TIME FOR US AS A

03:22:32.406 --> 03:22:33.441
STATE NOW TO STEP IN WAS SOME

03:22:33.508 --> 03:22:35.109
JUST BASIC PARAMETERS AND THAT'S

03:22:35.176 --> 03:22:36.644
WHAT THE BILL'S ATTEMPTING TO DO.

03:22:36.711 --> 03:22:37.912
SO IT IS STILL A BIT OF A WORK

03:22:37.979 --> 03:22:39.614
IN PROGRESS WE STILL HAVE YOU

03:22:39.680 --> 03:22:40.481
KNOW TIME WE HAVE OTHER

03:22:40.548 --> 03:22:41.549
COMMITTEES TO GO IN FRONT OF

03:22:41.616 --> 03:22:42.316
WHERE I'M SURE THEY'LL HAVE

03:22:42.383 --> 03:22:43.718
THEIR IDEAS SO.

03:22:43.784 --> 03:22:45.520
YOU KNOW WE DO ASK -- I WOULD

03:22:45.586 --> 03:22:47.054
ASK FOR KIND OF THE LEEWAY TO

03:22:47.121 --> 03:22:48.556
LET US CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

03:22:48.623 --> 03:22:53.261
WITH EVERYBODY WE KNOW WE STILL

03:22:53.327 --> 03:22:53.895
HAVE TO BRING IT TO THE FLOOR WE

03:22:53.961 --> 03:22:54.795
KNOW HAVE WE HAVE TO GET IT TO

03:22:54.862 --> 03:22:55.429
THE SENATE BUT I THINK IT'S TIME

03:22:55.496 --> 03:22:56.097
FOR THE STATE TO START ACTING IN

03:22:56.163 --> 03:22:56.297
A IN.

03:22:56.364 --> 03:22:56.898
A STATEWIDE WAY TO HAVE SOME

03:22:56.964 --> 03:22:59.000
CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE

03:22:59.066 --> 03:23:02.904
WITH THIS MODE OF TRANSPORTATION --

I SHOULD JUST IF I SHOULD JUST

03:23:09.577 --> 03:23:11.479
ASK IF THERE'S NO BARE MINIMUM

03:23:11.546 --> 03:23:13.180
SAFETY STANDARD.

03:23:13.247 --> 03:23:15.182
I'M GOING TO WITHHOLD SUPPORTING

03:23:15.249 --> 03:23:17.752

03:23:17.818 --> 03:23:18.786
BUT CAN YOU SPEAK.

03:23:18.853 --> 03:23:19.754
TO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT AT

03:23:19.820 --> 03:23:21.422
LEAST REQUIRES A BARE MINIMUM

03:23:21.489 --> 03:23:25.026
STANDARD OF SAFETY MEASURES.

03:23:25.092 --> 03:23:27.028
BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT

03:23:27.094 --> 03:23:30.298
ISSUE THIS IS AND DENSE AREAS

03:23:30.364 --> 03:23:31.699
AND I DON'T NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU

03:23:31.766 --> 03:23:33.701
ABOUT DENSE AREAS YOU REPRESENT

03:23:33.768 --> 03:23:35.503
A VERY DENSE AREA YOURSELF.

03:23:35.570 --> 03:23:38.005
MISTREATMENT BUT IN MONDAY IN MY

03:23:38.072 --> 03:23:40.708
DISTRICT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

03:23:40.775 --> 03:23:41.909
VERY SMALL.

03:23:41.976 --> 03:23:44.445
NO LESS THAN TEN SQUARE MILES

03:23:44.512 --> 03:23:47.515
AREA THAT HAS SEVERE DENSITY OF

03:23:47.582 --> 03:23:49.450
JUST WHERE I LIVE.

03:23:49.517 --> 03:23:51.252
WITHIN FIVE BLOCKS OF WHERE I MY

03:23:51.319 --> 03:23:52.253
RESIDENCE IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:53.888
ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND NEW

03:23:53.955 --> 03:23:55.189
APARTMENT UNITS COMING IN WITHIN

03:23:55.256 --> 03:23:56.223
THE NEXT TWO HOURS LET ME JUST

03:23:56.290 --> 03:23:57.592
SAY THAT THE THE MAN YOU'RE THE

03:23:57.658 --> 03:23:59.360
MANUFACTURERS ARE UNDER FEDERAL

03:23:59.427 --> 03:24:00.728
STANDARDS FOR SAFETY FOR THE

03:24:00.795 --> 03:24:02.196
VEHICLE ITSELF AND THEN IN TERMS.

03:24:02.263 --> 03:24:03.764
OF WHERE THEY'RE SAFE AND NOT

03:24:03.831 --> 03:24:04.966
SAFE TO RIDE FOR INSTANCE OF

03:24:05.032 --> 03:24:06.400
THEIR CERTAIN AREAS THAT ARE SO

03:24:06.467 --> 03:24:07.468
DENSE THAT THERE'S JUST NO PLACE

03:24:07.535 --> 03:24:08.169
FOR THEM.

03:24:08.235 --> 03:24:09.770
UNDER A BILL THAT'S STILL IS UP

03:24:09.837 --> 03:24:11.339
TO THE LOCALITY TO DETERMINE

03:24:11.405 --> 03:24:13.307
WHERE THE SCOOTERS WE'RE GONNA

03:24:13.374 --> 03:24:14.275
ARE GONNA BE ALLOWED SO WE'RE

03:24:14.342 --> 03:24:15.376
NOT SET A STANDARD WELL THAT'S

03:24:15.443 --> 03:24:17.111
UP TO EACH CITY TO SAY FOR

03:24:17.178 --> 03:24:18.112
INSTANCE.

03:24:18.179 --> 03:24:19.447
LOS ANGELES MIGHT VERY WELL OR A

03:24:19.513 --> 03:24:21.349
SOME CITY MIGHT CHOOSE TO SAY WE

03:24:21.415 --> 03:24:22.850
ONLY WANT THE SCOOTERS IN A

03:24:22.917 --> 03:24:23.884
PROTECTED.

03:24:23.951 --> 03:24:24.885
ENVIRONMENT -- WE ONLY WANT THE

03:24:24.952 --> 03:24:26.520
SCOOTERS ON CERTAIN TYPES OF

03:24:26.587 --> 03:24:27.388
STREETS AND THEY'RE FREE TO DO

03:24:27.455 --> 03:24:28.956
THAT THAT'S RIGHT THINK THE

03:24:29.023 --> 03:24:30.558
STATE SHOULDN'T COMMENTS AND TRY

03:24:30.625 --> 03:24:32.660
TO TELL CITIES EXACTLY WHERE AND

03:24:32.727 --> 03:24:33.427
WHERE NOT.

03:24:33.494 --> 03:24:34.862
IN THEIR COMMUNITY THEIR SAFE

03:24:34.929 --> 03:24:35.429
JUST THE WAY WE DON'T WITH

03:24:35.496 --> 03:24:37.164
BICYCLE WITH -- YOU KNOW WHERE

03:24:37.231 --> 03:24:39.900
WE DON'T DEMAND THAT CITIES.

03:24:39.967 --> 03:24:41.469
CREATE PROTECTED BY CLAIMS LET'S

03:24:41.535 --> 03:24:43.104
SAY ON CERTAIN STREETS WE LEAVE

03:24:43.170 --> 03:24:44.739
IT UP TO THEM TO DO THAT AND I

03:24:44.805 --> 03:24:45.206
THINK IT'S UP TO EACH

03:24:45.272 --> 03:24:46.574
MUNICIPALITY TO SAY.

03:24:46.641 --> 03:24:47.875
HEY THERE'S A LOT OF SCOOTER

03:24:47.942 --> 03:24:49.577
INTEREST IN MY CITY I BETTER SET

03:24:49.644 --> 03:24:50.611
UP SOME SAFE PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO

03:24:50.678 --> 03:24:51.879
RIDE AND I THINK THAT'S THE

03:24:51.946 --> 03:24:53.414
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CITY TO

03:24:53.481 --> 03:24:55.416
TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR COMMUNITY.

03:24:55.483 --> 03:24:56.984
THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE

03:24:57.051 --> 03:24:58.619
THERE'S A LOT OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE

03:24:58.686 --> 03:24:59.654
WHO ARE DISSIDENTS SCOOTERS THE

03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:02.056
CITY SHOULD INSTALL SAFE PLACES

03:25:02.123 --> 03:25:02.623
FOR THOSE SCOOTERS BECAUSE

03:25:02.690 --> 03:25:03.758
OTHERWISE THEY ARE GOING TO END

03:25:03.824 --> 03:25:05.059
UP WITH SCOOTERS.

03:25:05.126 --> 03:25:06.227
YOU KNOW ON THE STREET UNSAFE

03:25:06.293 --> 03:25:07.528
CONDITIONS SO I THINK IT'S

03:25:07.595 --> 03:25:09.397
REALLY UP TO THOSE LOCALITIES TO

03:25:09.463 --> 03:25:11.432
LOOK AT THEIR CONSTITUENCY.

03:25:11.499 --> 03:25:12.600
YOU KNOW IN SOME CITIES THEIR

03:25:12.667 --> 03:25:13.234
BABY THERE ARE A LOT OF SCOOTERS

03:25:13.300 --> 03:25:14.802
RAINY SCOOTER SO I WOULDN'T

03:25:14.869 --> 03:25:16.570
FORCE THEM TO GO AHEAD AND DO SO

03:25:16.637 --> 03:25:18.105
YOU KNOW PROTECTED SCOOTER LANES

03:25:18.172 --> 03:25:19.874
BUT OTHER CITIES PROBABLY SHOULD

03:25:19.940 --> 03:25:21.242
DO THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

03:25:21.308 --> 03:25:27.948
SOMETHING THAT MAYBE IS BEST.

03:25:28.015 --> 03:25:30.418
CITY TO CITY BUT IN TERMS OF THE

03:25:30.484 --> 03:25:31.252
THE DEVICES THEMSELVES THERE

03:25:31.318 --> 03:25:32.920
CERTAINLY ARE MANDATES AS TO YOU

03:25:32.987 --> 03:25:35.456
KNOW SAFETY FOR THEM AND I THINK

03:25:35.523 --> 03:25:36.090
WE'LL SEE THAT INCREASING AT ALL

03:25:36.157 --> 03:25:36.357
AT THAT.

03:25:36.424 --> 03:25:38.192

03:26:07.655 --> 03:26:10.124
DEFINITELY THE PREFERRED OPTION --

03:26:10.191 --> 03:26:11.692
WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY.

03:26:11.759 --> 03:26:13.294
TO CALL MANDATE THAT -- BUT WE

03:26:13.360 --> 03:26:15.429

DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF A CITY --

03:29:25.185 --> 03:29:26.487
