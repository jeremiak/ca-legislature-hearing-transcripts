SO THANK YOU AGAIN ALL OF YOU- COLLEAGUES- FACULTY MEMBERS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR BEING HERE AT THIS HEARING TODAY- THE TOPIC OF THIS HEARING IS ETHNIC STUDIES AND TEACHER PREPARATION- TWO TOPICS THAT THAT ARE VERY CLOSE AND DEAR TO ME- IMPASSES THE PASSAGE OF AB ONE OH ONE- MAKES ETHNIC STUDIES A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. OF IN THE YEAR TWENTY NINE THIRTY FOR THOSE GRADUATING IN THAT YEAR. FOR ETHNIC STUDIES TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR ETHNIC STUDIES- DOING WHAT IT IS SET OUT TO DO. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TEACHERS TEACHING AT TEACHING THESE CLASSES AND TEACHERS THAT ARE WELL GROUNDED IN THEIR WITH THEIR GONNA TEACH AS I LEARNED IN STUDENT TEACHING YOU CAN'T TEACH WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. AND SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS TO FIND OUT WHAT IS UC AND CSU DOING NOW SO THAT WE CAN PREPARE AND BE READY WHEN IT BECOMES A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. WE KNOW THE POWER OF ETHNIC STUDIES WE HAVE SEEN THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN I SAW THAT IN MY OWN CLASSROOM. THAT ETHNIC STUDIES WHETHER UP BEACH GHANA STUDIES BLACK STUDIES NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES TRANSFORM STUDENTS. BUT IT DOES SO WHEN THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM BELIEVES IN WHAT HE OR SHE IS DOING. AND HAS THE KNOWLEDGE A TO TEACH THAT CLASS AND WE ALSO WANT TEACHERS THAT ARE PASSIONATE. AND WITH THAT I WILL- NOW EXTENDS FIRST TO MY COLLEAGUE MR SANTIAGO FOR OPENING REMARKS. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR A LOT OF- MARCH HERE BUT ALSO FOR HOLDING THIS IS OFTENTIMES WHEN WE- WORK REALLY HARD TO GET LEGISLATION THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION THE THING THAT MAKES OR BREAKS. AND ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS IMPORTANT I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE ONLY MEETING I THINK WE SHOULD DO THIS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS NOT JUST NOT JUST ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHERS- THE OVERSIGHT OF CURRICULUM AND ENSURING THAT THE OUTCOME- SAID IN THE BILL ARE ACTUALLY- ARE ACTUALLY SHOWN. ON IT HAVING THE ABILITY TO DO ETHNIC STATUS AND OTHER SPEAK FROM THE HEART FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCES WITH A COMPLETE GAME CHANGER THIS WASN'T AVAILABLE SOMETHING- THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND IN FACT WAS QUITE THE OPPOSITE WE WERE TAUGHT A DEALER SO HISTORY I AM ALWAYS WE SHOULD BE HISTORY THERE'S A DIFFERENT SORT OF- NEW WHO YOUR AS A PEOPLE AND FINDING A POWER WERE OTHER DON'T- THE IN A EXPERIENCE FOR EXAMPLE. YOUR ONE VERSE OF HISTORY THAT TAKE A LOOK AT. IMMIGRATION PATTERNS AND USE. OF FORCE THAT WE THE NORTH THE LIFE ILLEGAL- IMMIGRANTS. BUT THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE AND HOW MEANT THE PEOPLE TO COME HERE TO MAKE A LIFE BETTER WHAT WE- TO THIS TO THIS INTO THE STATE MORE OUT OF LIFE. COMMENTED TO CHANGE FOR I HAD THE BENEFIT THE HOWEVER. AND HOW THEY ARE GOING TO SPEND- OF WHICH GAVE ME THE BILL UNDER WHERE HE'S IS AND QUITE FRANKLY THEY WHAT MAY ME TO WANT TO. I DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING. THAT WAS MORE THAN JUST. ALL IT WHICH WAS THE GOAL TO OUR NAY A CHANGE. CHANGE THE THAT WERE THERE BUT THAT HAPPEN TO IT WAS IN THE THERE WAS A INSTRUCTOR WHO TOOK THE TIME TO SHOW ME THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT HISTORY- TO WHO MY PEOPLE WERE AND WHAT WE DID AND HOW WE BECAME EMPOWER. I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH OF A GAME CHANGER IT IS TO HAVE ETHNIC STUDIES IT AND I THINK WE'VE ALL SAT IN THE FRONT WAYS BUT THE ABILITY TO DO THIS IN HIGH SCHOOL DETERMINES OUR ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IN COLLEGE WILL OUR CAREER PATHS WHAT WE CONTRIBUTE BACKTRACKING MEANS NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T IF WE DON'T DO THIS. BUT I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE ETHNIC STUDIES AND THAT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT DAY AND THAT WE GET EMPOWERMENT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO WE ARE OUR HISTORY IN WHO WE BECOME OUR CULTURE. THAT AIM KEY TO THAT IS GOING TO HAVE THE INSTRUCTOR SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING IN HAPPENING THAT ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. TO GO TO CREATE THAT INSTRUCTOR THAT TEACHER AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL- OR OTHERWISE WHO WHO'S GOING TO HELP TEACH THOSE MINES ABOUT OUR PEOPLE'S HISTORY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO THIS RIGHT IF WE DON'T DO THIS RIGHT. THE THINGS WE SET OUT TO DO IN THE BILL I SAY WE BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY SHARED THAT SAME PASSION THAT YOU LET IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT. WE WILL HAVE MISSED IN OUR- A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO EMPOWER PEOPLE WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL TRIED TO DO NOT JUST EDUCATORS IT'S A BILL OF EMPOWERMENT THAT HELPS TO CHANGE LIVES COMMUNITIES AND PRODUCE THE NEXT THE NEXT- LEADERSHIP- IN CALIFORNIA BE IT AT IN THE CORPORATE LEVEL BE IT IN INSTITUTIONS OR EVEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT. AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ISSUES IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL. AB THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO DR CHOI IF YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU CHAIR I AM ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THIS- PROCESS AT THE NEXT THIRTY IS- BEING REQUIRED- AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL SCHOOL RISA. I COME FROM SOUTH KOREA REGIONALLY- I WILL COUNTRY WAS BRAGGING- HOW OUR SOUTH KOREA WAS A MADE UP OF LAW. IT DOES SO WITHOUT- ONE PEOPLE. AND NOW- THE SITUATION IS-CHANGING I THINK GOAL OVER THE WORD- ECONOMY REQUIRES- PAPER TO MOVE AROUND. NOW MANY DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS ARE ARE MOVING TO KOREA- AND- THEY BECOME A GOOD WORKFORCE. HAVING IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY- IN MY ADULT LIFE- I SUDDENLY- I FOUND A DIFFERENT WORD. THIS COUNTRY WAS- KNOCKED OUT MONO ETHNIC COUNTRY MADE UP OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT- PEOPLE WITH A DIFFERENT ETHNIC BACKGROUND AND LANGUAGE BACK ON THE COUCH OR BACKGROUND. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS COUNTRY HAD TO GO THROUGH- IN TONER- PROCESS- THROUGH A CIVIL WAR AND THE STEELERS CB IT RIGHT SO ARE NOT TOTALLY- A RESULT THE MATTERS IT I THINK A CELLPHONE. ISSUE AND THE MANY- SOCIAL PROBLEMS ARE BEING PRESENTED TO- ISSUE WE HAVE SEEN IT FOR NO REASON THE YEARS. AND EVEN THOUGH- KOREAN COMMUNITY HAVE% SUFFERED. I THINK BUSINESSES- HAVE A SEPARATE THEM MOST- FOR VARIOUS REASONS NOW DURIG THE LA RIOTS. AND THE NAM OF KOREAN COMMUNITY IS SO REALIZING THAT THE HOW WE CAN- EXPO- SO OF A KOREAN PEOPLE TO BOTH THE- DIFFERENT NOT GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND TO CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT. IN OUR COMMUNITY MORE ARE AVAILABLE OUR COMMUNITY IN PEACE AND HARMONY OR THE DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS. AND A TEACHING OUR DIFFERENCES IN THE BACKGROUND- THROUGH THE HIGH SCHOOL. AND THE- I THINK THIS IS A EXCELLENT IDEA BUT IT'LL BE A LOT OF WHAT CHALLENGES BECAUSE THIS IS A NOT ONE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS OF- ETHNIC ETHNICITY WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT. I BET. INTERVIEW OVER ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT KINDS SELF LAW A DIFFERENT CULTURES AND A- ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS- BECAUSE I DO KNOW THAT THAT. COMING FROM CITY OF IRVINE- EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARS TO BE A WHITE COMMUNITY IN FACT- IT IS NOT THE WHEN IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I. HAVE DONE- SURVEY AND THEN I THINK THAT THEY UPDATE THAT THE SURVEY CONTINUES TO THE- WHAT THE MOTHER LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK AT HOME. THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S A NEARLY SEVENTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ARE BEING SPOKEN AT HOMES. YOU CAN SEE OF THE WORKABLE CULTURES AND ETHNIC BACKGROUND. THE S. C. IS A MADE UP. THINK OF WHAT THE UNITED STATES THINK OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW MANY DIFFERENT CULTURES SO WE ARE DEALING WITH WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THE STATE. SO EXPECT TO SEE DIFFERENT THIS KIND OF WHAT DIFFERENCE IS- AND THOUGH FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR BACKGROUND THAT THEIR CONTRIBUTION IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT OUR DIFFERENCES AND THEN ALSO BEAUTIFUL CULTURES THAT THEY BRING IN IN EARLY HF DURING THE HIGH SCHOOL TIME SO HOW WE CAN SEGMENT WITH A THERAPY ONE SEMESTER ONE NEAR WE NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT THAT AND THE WHAT PORTION HOW WE CAN SLICE THE TIME. AND THE TEACH ENOUGH- CURRICULUM- ENOUGH THE CONTENT BELONGING TO THAT THE PARTICULAR ISSUES BECAUSE I DO SEE HERE WHAT IS ETHNIC STUDIES STUFF FOR FUNDAMENTAL DISCIPLINES OF AFRICAN AMERICAN BACKGROUND- CHICANOS SOURCE TO THAT FILIPINOS NATIVE AMERICANS ASIAN AMERICAN SLASH IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDERS I'M SURE THERE ARE SO THOSE ARE MENTIONED HERE AND THE KOREAN COMMUNITY. IN LOS ANGELES TEACHERS HAVE BEEN SO EXCITED- EVER SINCE OF THIS BILL WILL ALSO INTRODUCED A AND THE PARTICULARLY. AFTER YOU'VE PASSED THE- IN INVOLVED. IS SO OTHER ON AND IN PERSON- PREP. BY A KOREAN EDUCATORS TO COME UP WITH US TO DEVELOP THE MODERATE CURRICULA EVEN IN BOARDING OUR SUPERINTENDENT- SOMEONE AND HE WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN AN ONLINE DISCUSSION EVEN NOT A MONTH AGO WE MET THEY AND THEY LAY AND THAT THEY ARE SO EXCITED OF WHAT THE MODERN CURRICULUM WHAT ISSUES. AT THE WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL OR SO WHAT CONTRIBUTIONS SO THAT ASIAN AMERICANS BUT IN PARTICULAR KOREAN AMERICANS HAVE MADE IN THIS COUNTRY SO TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE AMOUNT OF CURRICULUM TO FIT INTO THAT THE SEGMENT OF TIME THAT MAY BE LOCATED ON. FOOD TO LEARN ABOUT THE ASIAN CULTURE AND- PARTICULAR- KOREAN AMERICAN CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALL KOREAN COACHES SO I'M SURE THIS KIND OF A WORKER WOULD BE QUITE LONG- AMONG MANY DIFFERENT ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS I HOPE WHAT THEY DO TRY T COME UP HIM UP. WHAT IN. I LOVE. WE CAN TEACH. ONCE THOSE SHOT X. TO TYPICAL IMPORT THE HIGH. ISSUE SO OF THIS ETHNIC. THEN THINK THAT THEY WERE ON TO BETTER AND- WHEN SOMEONE YOU COME FROM THIS CULTURE AND THIS BACKGROUND AND THAT THEY ARE MORE CURIOUS AND THAT THEY WILL UNLIKELY TO BECOME MORE FRIENDS. AND THEN WHEN THEY ARE INTERESTED ENOUGH HOPEFULLY THEY CAN- PICK AND CHOOSE- A HORDE- MAJORIE CANDY- AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES ALL ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES SO IT HISPANIC STUDIES THAT YOU CAN BE THEIR OWN. IN ALL OF COLLEGE MAJOR. AND I IN FACT I INTRODUCED OF KOREAN CULTURE FESTIVAL. TEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS SO CONCERNED MEMBER THERE. AND A WIN TROUPE OF THE KOREAN I'M SYMBOL ELECTED THAT THE CITY NEAR. TO THE COUNSELOR. R. O. FIVE US OF PLUS. AND THE ORANGE COUNTY RED IS KNOWING THE PRODUCT KOREANS ARE KOREAN HAVE A POSITIVE STATEMENT THE HOT WHENEVER I DO A STATE. AND THE FLIPPING OVER HER ENTIRE STORY ABOUT US- AND THEN IWAS AFRAID THE- ENGINE OWNED OUT ON THE FLOOR I TRY TO CELEBRATE THE KOREAN AMERICAN DAY JANUARY FIFTH- THIRTEENTH THE- AND- THE PURPOSE OF THAT THE- FESTIVAL WAS SHOCKED. CEREMONY FIVE MINNESOTA MANY PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES CONGRATULATIONS THAT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING SO I'M GOING TO HAPPEN FOR YOU DALY COACH WATER FESTIVAL FOR ALL THE CITIZENS OF IRVINE COME OUT DURING THE VISIT TO COME OUT AND ENJOY IT LEARN ABOUT THE- TASTE SYSTEM KIMCHI- APPROVAL HE OR OR OR OR A K. POP WELL- BTS HOMEWORK KERN NUMB STYLE OR WHATEVER. THEY CAN THEY CAN IN ALL FIELDS AND EXPERIENCE SO THAT THE WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND THE MOST LIKELY THEY WOULD BECOME A FRIEND SAYS THAT'S THE REASON IT IS BUT THIS YEAR WE ARE. AFTER STOPPING TWO YEARS SAID THIS YEAR- WE ARE RESUMING FOR ELEVEN THIRTY YEARS CELEBRATION I THINK THAT IS- AN EXAMPLE I WANT TO INTRODUCE SO HOPEFULLY THIS ETHNIC STUDIES WE EXPLORED. ALL DIFFERENT KINDS SHOULD ANSWER. DIFFERENT CULTURES SO I THINK THIS IS A HEALTHY WEIGHT- ARE SO REPUBLICAN IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT. FOR ME TO VOTE ON THAT I THINK I BELIEVE I WAS THE ONLY REPUBLICAN DEFYING THE RECOMMENDED THE BOOK THAT. FOR YOU I GOT UP TO A LOT. HEY ARE YOU VOTE FORCE R. T. WHAT I BOOK FOR R. T. I LOOKED UP I COULDN'T FIND THIS YEAR IF YOU WERE. THERE. AND ALLOW YOU. ASKED HOME IT WAS A CRITICAL. WAS GOING TO ON. SO I THINK THROUGH THE KIND OF A HEARING CAN CUT. AND- BUT UP SOME ISSUE AT THIS IS A GOOD THE STEP OF WILL HAVE IN. THANK TO SHOW. THANK YOU DON'T. THANK YOU TO JOY- THE MAY REMIND MY COLLEAGUE THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR BRIEF OPENING LIKE ARAMBULA. DR WEBER. WELL I WILL THAT BE PRE- I AM VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY- ETHNIC CITIES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- AS MY COLLEAGUE- MIGUEL SANTIAGO MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THIS IN SCHOOLS GROWING UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I WAS LUCKY THAT I HAD A PARENT WHO- IS VERY FAMILIAR AND AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY- AND SO THAT SHE COULD IMPART THAT KNOWLEDGE ON ME AND MY BROTHERS BUT YOU KNOW NOW THAT I HAVE TWO LITTLE ONES OF MY OWN AND THAT'S NOT MY BACKGROUND BUT I'M TRYING TO TEACH THEM ABOUT OUR HISTORY. IT'S NOT AS EASY AS ONE WOULD THINK AND SO IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT ONLY HAVE THIS IN THEIR IN THEIR CURRICULUM THAT WE DO IT RIGHT AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THE TEACHERS THAT ARE TEACHING THIS ARE EDUCATED THEMSELVES THAT WE DON'T JUST SAY REGULAR SCIENCE INSTRUCTOR CAN REGULAR HISTORY INSTRUCTOR CAN DO IT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND ETHNIC STUDIES MUST UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES SO THAT YOU CAN TEACH IT TO THE STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO THE OTHER TEACHER- IT DOES HELP DEVELOP A SENSE OF APPRECIATION AND RESPECT AND I REMEMBER GROWING UP. YOU KNOW THERE WAS THIS- BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW BLACK PEOPLE JUST WEREN'T GOOD IN MATH YOU KNOW BLACK KIDS JUST AREN'T GOOD IN MATH AND SCIENCE BUT THEN WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR HISTORY AND WE LEARN ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE KATHERINE JOHNSON AND REALIZE THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE TO THE MOON HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR. BOOKS MATHEMATICIANS JUST OF HOW MANY FOR TWENTY WE CAN HAVE NEW THAT AND WE WEREN'T AT THAT TIME STEREO TYPE PRINT ORDER YOU KNOW PUT A BOX AROUND WHAT WE AS A PEOPLE WE'RE GOOD AT AND WHAT WE ARE AT. NO THING UP LEARNING ALLOWS FOR TOLERANCE ALLOWS FOR YOU TO REALIZE THAT YOU'RE A TWO ENTITIES ARE LIMITLESS AND SO I AM VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE TODAY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO US GETTING THIS. RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT IT CAN BE A BLUE PRINT FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER MR LEFT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- AND MR VICE CHAIR. FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANT WORK OF THIS BODY AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY SPECIFICALLY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PUSHED FOR THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WITH RESPECT TO A LEGACY AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE CHAIR FOR HELPING TO CONVENE US IN ACTUALLY GETTING THE JOB DONE. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A BLUEPRINT FOR NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE COUNTRY. IT IS. THE WORST KEPT SECRET THAT THERE ARE. SOME DEEP DIVISIONS IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR STATE. AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT AS WE HOPE TO RECTIFY THE INJUSTICES. THAT WE LEARN ABOUT OUR OWN HISTORY. AND SIMILARLY TO. HEAR FROM THE VERY PASSIONATE WORDS OF THE REPUBLICAN VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE KNOWING THAT THIS IS A BIPARTISAN MEASURE. THAT WE ARE STRONGER WE KNOW ABOUT OUR OWN HISTORY. AND BEING A FOURTH GENERATION CALIFORNIAN SPEAKING MORE SPANISH THAN I DO CHINESE. AND ALSO FEELING LIKE A PERPETUAL FOREIGNER IN MY OWN COUNTRY. I WISH THAT I HAD ETHNIC STUDIES AS A STUDENT. THAT I WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE STRUGGLES AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE NOT JUST MY OWN BUT WE SHARED BY A NUMBER OF OTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE LIVED IN SHARED EXPERIENCES. OF THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF. THOSE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED LATINO FARMWORKER MOVEMENT WHICH IS ALSO ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. LEADING US TO. THE RIGHT OF WORD GAY ANYMORE IN SOME STATES FUNDAMENTALS OF HUMANITY. AND THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF BASIC HUMANITY THAT WE MUST LOVE ONE ANOTHER. AND THAT WE MUST BUILD A COALITION TO UPLIFT EACH OTHER. BUT WE DON'T. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IF WE DON'T KNOW OUR OWN HISTORY. AND SO. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON OUR VALUES AGAIN COMMEND OUR COMMITTEE CHAIR. FOR YOUR STEWARDSHIP IN HELPING TO ENSURE THAT ALL VOICES ARE HERE. AND ONE FINAL POINT. ASSEMBLY EMBER MEDINA HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS TO ENSURE ALL VOICES AT THE TABLE AND AS VICE CHAIR OF H. PROVIDER CAUCUS IN THIS CHAIR THE LGBT CAUCUS I KNOW YOU HAVE CONVENE TO VARIOUS CAUCUSES. HELPING ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR VOICES ARE AT THE TABLE AS DIFFICULT AS IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT HAVING CONVERSATIONS IN THIS BODY ABOUT HOW WE SHARE POWER HOW WE TALK ABOUT RACE HOW TO RESPECT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO. DO SO. THIS IS AN AFFIRMATION FOR US TO CONTINUE THESE. DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS. BUT TO DO IT WITH A SENSE OF GRACE. AND LOVE. AND RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER'S CULTURES AND BUILDING UNDERSTANDING SO I'M JUST INCREDIBLY PROUD. OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT HERE AND TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR LOW MR GABRIEL. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE OVER MANY YEARS- AND I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE DOING- THE OVERSIGHT HEARING TALK ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BECAUSE- THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE KIND OF DIVERSE PLURALISTIC MULTI ETHNIC DEMOCRACY. THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT OUR HISTORY AND WE NEED TO TEACH OUR HISTORY THAT IS PROBABLY REFLECTIVE OF ALL COMMUNITIES AND I THINK BACK TO THE HISTORY THAT I LEARNED. AS A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE. THINKING ABOUT FOURTH GRADE WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT OUR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY WRITING YOU WOULD BE BUILT A MISSION OUT OF SUGAR CUBES IN YOU. WHITEWASH EVERYTHING ELSE. IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER IN LIFE TAT I REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO RELEASE TARGET TO THIS COMMUNITY KNOW. THAT FOR THE SAME FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND THE ANTI COMMUNITY AND SO MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES. FAIL TO SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORY. AND WE GLOSSED OVER- OR DIDN'T TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE MOST COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT PARTS OF OUR HISTORY AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. THE STRONG MULTI ETHNIC DEMOCRACY THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. WE HAVE TO OF ETHNIC STUDIES AND WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE TO OPEN PEOPLE'S HEARTS AND MINDS- IF PEOPLE HAVE TO SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN THE HISTORY BOOK. YOU KNOW AT THE SAME TIME I DO YOU THINK THAT THE NUANCES REALLY IMPORTANT HERE. THIS HAS BEEN A COMPLICATED CONVERSATION AS WE'VE GONE HERE WE THERE WERE CERTAINLY COMPLICATED CONVERSATIONS AROUND. THE MODEL CURRICULUM- AND I REMEMBER A- VERY POWERFUL CONVERSATION I HAD WITH THE OTHER DOCTOR WEBER. I'M NOT THE ONE THAT I PRIVILEGE TO SIT NEXT TO. NOW ABOUT HOW ETHNIC STUDIES DONE RIGHT CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL. STUDIES DONE WRONG WHEN YOU DON'T GET THE DETAILS RIGHT- CAN BE VERY DIVISIVE. AND CAN CAUSE- CAN CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND SO. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT YOU KNOW WE AS A LEGISLATURE TO WANT TO THANK- ARE. A MY COLLEAGUE HERE FOR HIS FOR HIS COMMENTS AND FOR HIS AFFIRMATION. YOU KNOW WE I THINK HAVE TRY TO CHART A COURSE HERE AND THE- INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION IS ON THE SAME OF AN ETHNIC STUDIES THAT IS BROADLY INCLUSIVE- THAT DOESN'T PROMOTE BIGOTRY OR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ANY GROUP OF STUDENTS IN THE CLASS- AND WE BUILT A- REALLY STRONG GUARD. TO ME DO WE DO THAT SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THAT- I AM FIRMLY OF THE BELIEF THAT WE CAN HAVE. A STRONG. POWERFUL NINETY OPENING EDGY ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM. BUT DO THAT IN A WAY IN WHICH- YOU KNOW NO COMMUNITY HERE FEELS TARGETED AND SO. I THINK GETTING INTO THE NEW WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I LOOK FOR TO THAT CONVERSATION TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL. THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES FROM TAKING THE TIME. TO I AGREE WITH YOU. WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT MOVING FORWARD. AND THAT IS THAT WE HAVE. A TEACHING FORCE. THAT KNOWS. WHAT THEY'RE TEACHING. AND IT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER IT. IN A POWERFUL WAY SO THAT IT REMAINS WHAT IT'S BEEN- OVER TIME. AND WITH THAT I'M GONNA CALL THE FIRST PANEL. OF FORWARD. OR AT LEAST THOSE WHO ARE HERE. DR MIKE TORRANCE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- IT WILL BE. ON THE SCREEN- DIRECTOR OF CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS AND INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES AND ERIN SCREWBALL AND THE GOOD FROM THE COMMISSION OF TEACHER CREDENTIALING DIRECTOR OF CERTIFICATION WILL ALSO BE VIA- INTERNET THE WEB AND THEN DOCTOR- DAVID DID WIRED DIRECTOR OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES DIVISION SO HOPEFULLY THEY ARE THERE- DR MIKE TOWARDS WILL BE THERE TO BEGIN THE PAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DR MIKE FLORES DIRECTOR OF THE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS IN INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES DIVISION ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK ON THE TOPIC OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES GRADUATION REQUIREMENT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A BRIEF STATEMENT ABOUT ELATION SHIP A STANDARD. CONTRACT PARTS TOMORROW CURRICULA AND INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES JUST TO SET THE STAGE THE STANDARDS ARE WHAT WE WANT OUR STUDENTS TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND AND BE ABLE TO DO BY THE END OF EVERY GRADE LEVEL SO FOR TEACHERS THAT. THE WHITE FOR INSTRUCTION CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS ON THE OTHER HAND PROVIDING INSTRUCTIONAL GUIDANCE FOR EDUCATORS ON HOW TO DESIGN. STANDARDS CURRICULUM. IMPLEMENTED THAT CURRICULA- HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION TO SUPPORT ALL OF THAT INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS ARE THE TOOLS SUCH AS BOOKS AND LEARNING MATERIALS IN A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT NOT. IT'S THE- GAINES DECISION AND SELECTING THE AFFECT TEACHING. THAT LEADS US TO MASS OF THE CONTENT STANDARDS NOW THE MODEL CURRICULUM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY OR- THE ETHNIC STUDIES IS A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT THAT PROVIDES SUPPORT TO TEACHERS AND LEADERS IN HELPING THE COURSES AND OR DIRECTION CONTENT IN A SPECIFIC TOPIC AREA SO IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CLASSROOM CURRICULUM OR SET OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS RATHER IT'S INTENDED AS- FOCUSED. LIKE TO TRANSITION TO THE ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM ITSELF- AS YOU INDICATED THAT MODEL CURRICULUM WAS ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD ON MARCH EIGHTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE MODEL CURRICULUM WAS DEVELOPED BROADLY AS INTENDED TARGETS THAT ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO. CARPORT THE PEOPLE DEMOCRATS SPECIFICALLY IN THEIR COMMUNITY TO THE STUDENTS SITTING IN THOSE TWO THE AT THE STUDIES MARK MISS GAME THAT EMPOWERING STUDENTS BY ELIMINATING THE OFTEN UNTOLD STRUGGLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE FOUR GROUPS ACTUAL STUDIES THAT MIGHT SURE IN TROUBLE DO YOU TO. STATE GROUP THE TWO. NATIONAL ETHNIC STUDIES FOR TO STAB INTEL HIGHER EDUCATION THE FOCUS ON THOSE FOR GROUP FROM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS. TWO AMERICAN SOCIETY OF THESE HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED PEOPLE'S WHO HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNTOLD IN U. S. HISTORY COURSES HOWEVER IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT COMMUNITY HAS ITS OWN TECHNICAL AS A VICE CHURCH PRIEST BURKE OF ANY AGE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP IS IT'S OWN UNIQUE THREE TROUBLES IN CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STATE SO THEREFORE THE MOP BREAKING SPORTS LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THE FLEXIBILITY. TO ADAPT THE CORRECT ADDRESS THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND DIVERSITY THERE JUST AS CHEAP EIGHT AB ONE ONE WAS SIGNED INTO LAW CREATING THE ETHNIC STUDIES GRAY PART. HE WON AT COMPLETE ONE COURSE IN NEXT. TO HIGH SCHOOL. AND STARTING WITH COUPONS FOR AND TWENTY NINE THIRTY SCHOOL YEAR AND IN ORDER TO MEET THAT DEADLINE SCHOOLS IN JUST FIRST HAVE TO OFFER OF COURSE BY THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX YEAR. NOW THE MINIMUM COURSE LENGTHS TO FULFILL THIS REQUIREMENT IS ONE SEMESTER BUT SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS MAY CHOOSE REQUIRE A FULL YEAR COURSE IN ETHNIC STUDIES CENTERS FLEXIBILITY IN DETERMINING HOW STUDENT MAY SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT INCLUDING. FORCES BASED ON THE MODEL CURRICULUM AND ETHNIC STUDIES THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD. AND EXIST PATH STUDIES COURSE THROUGH AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE TAUGHT AS PART OF A COURSE THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED AS A MEETING ETAJIMA REQUIREMENTS. OR A LOCALLY DEVELOPED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL SO AS FAR AS THE QUESTION OF HOW MANY TEACHERS ARE NEEDED TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. AT THIS TIME WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA LONGITUDINAL PUPIL ACHIEVEMENT DATA SYSTEM ANNUALLY OVER TWO. FIVE HUNDRED. PUBLIC SCHOOLS SERVE OUR HIGH SCHOOL POPULATION SO THAT INCLUDES TRADITIONAL HIGH SCHOOLS CONTINUATION ALTERNATIVE COMMUNITY DAY AND K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE GRADUATING CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO HAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS ENROLLED AS OF THE CENSUS DAY WHICH IS THE FIRST WEDNESDAY IN OCTOBER. SO IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY THIRD STUDENT RATIOS AND THE FREQUENCY OF COURSE OFFERINGS WITHIN THEIR LOCAL PASTOR CATTLE. EVEN IF IT'S JUST ONE TEACHER SCHOOL SITE THAT WOULD MEAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TEACHERS. NUMBER THAT GOES UP FROM THERE DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL TEACHER TO STUDENT RATIO. ANOTHER APPROACH WOULD BE TO ALLOW X. THE STAFF THE OPRAH. BACK I. THE WORK CD EAST EDUCATOR ACTS IN D'HIV WHO HAVE BEEN AND WILL THE MILLION DOLLAR AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT TO PROVIDE ELEAZAR WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT THAT DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND EXPANDED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES AS WELL AS CREATE AN ONLINE PROPOSED NEXT STUDIES STRUCTURAL RESOURCES I NEVER WHAT WAS SUPPOSED IN MARCH CAN FIND SANTEE COUNTY EDUCATION AS THE ANTICIPATED CONTRACTOR THROUGH A REQUEST FOR APPLICATION. WE ANTICIPATE A CONTRACTOR WILL FORM AND FACILITATE A MONTHLY COLLABORATION COMMITTEE THAT WILL DEVELOP AND REVIEW PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES USED FOR THIS PROJECT. DEVELOPING FACILITY AT LEAST TEXT TOTAL STATE MY PROFESSIONAL LEARNING PROGRAMS SUCH AS COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE. DEVELOPING SUPPORT SYSTEM A REGIONAL COMMUNITIES ARE PRACTICES THAT WILL PROVIDE LOCAL SUPPORT TO EDUCATORS IN ELEAZAR DEVELOPING HIS NUCLEAR AND EXPANDED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES. PROVIDE ONGOING CLASSROOM SUPPORT TO EDUCATORS ADMINISTRATORS AND PARA PROFESSIONALS IN BETWEEN SCHEDULED STATEWIDE REGIONAL CHANNEL COMMITTEE IT IS A PRACTICE AND CAN SUPPORT AN ONLINE REPOSITORY THAT PROVIDES RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THESE NEW AND EXPANDED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED FORCES THAT USE THE STATE BOARD ADOPTED ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM NOW THERE'S ALREADY FACE APPLICANTS WERE ENCOURAGED TO PARTNER WITH INSTITUTES OF HIGHER AND- TO SUPPORT AT STUDIES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. IT PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE EXPERT IN THE FIELD PROVIDING ONGOING CONTENT AND INSTRUCTIONAL GUIDANCE TO PROJECT PARTICIPANTS. SO I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP ALL OF YOUR TIME SO I'LL CONCLUDE THEIR- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DR TAURUS IT NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM PARENTS SCHOOL BALL COMMISSION OF TEACHER CREDENTIALING DIRECTOR OF THE CERTIFICATION DIVISION. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDIA MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE THAT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS ERIN SCREWBALL AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CERTIFICATES IN DIVISION FOR THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. OUR DIVISION OVERSEES THE EVALUATION AND PROCESSING APPLICATIONS FOR CREDENTIALS PERMITS CERTIFICATES IN WAIVERS WE ALSO OVERSEE THE ANNUAL MONITORING OF TEACHER ASSIGNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING IS HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT FOR THE STATE IS DOING TO BE PREPARED FOR THE NEW CASE RECALL ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT. THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THE VALUE THAT COMES FROM CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SEEING THEMSELVES IN THEIR CURRICULUM THROUGH ETHNIC STUDIES. I WANTED TO BEGIN FIRST BY PROVIDING SOME BACKGROUND ON CREDENTIALING AS IT RELATES TO ETHNIC STUDIES. CURRENTLY THERE ARE TWO CREDENTIALS THE AUTHORIZED A TEACHER TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES. THE MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL- IN THE SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIAL BOTH OF THESE ARE GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHING CREDENTIALS THE AUTHORIZED SERVICE IN DIFFERENT CLASSROOM SETTINGS. WELL SUBJECT CREDENTIALS AUTHORIZED SERVICE IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SETTING AND ALLOW TEACHER TO TEACH ALL CONTENT WHICH INCLUDES ETHNIC STUDIES TO STUDENTS IN A SELF CONTAINED CLASSROOM SETTING WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING ALL THEIR INSTRUCTION FROM A SINGLE TEACHER THROUGHOUT THE DAY. SINGLE SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIALS ARE TYPICALLY USED AT THE MIDDLE OR HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND THEY ALLOW THE TEACHER TO TEACH AT VERY SPECIFIC CONTENT IN A DEPARTMENT ALLIES CLASSROOM. WHERE THE TEACHER IS FOCUSED ON TEACHING ONLY ONE SUBJECT IN A SINGLE CLASS PERIOD ARE EARNED BASED UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE SUBJECT MATTER REQUIREMENTS. IN ONE OR MORE BROAD STATUTORY SUBJECT AREAS IT'S LISTED AS THE CREDENTIALS AUTHORIZATION. IS BROAD SUBJECTS ARE ORGANIZED LIKE AN UMBRELLA WITH RELATED SUBJECT AREAS. WITHIN THE AUTHORIZATION ALLOWING THE TEACHER TO TEACH MULTIPLE INTERCONNECTED CONTENT AREAS THROUGHOUT THEIR PRIMARY AUTHORIZATION. SO FOR SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIALS ETHNIC STUDIES FALLS WITHIN THE BROAD AUTHORIZATION OF SOCIAL SCIENCE THE SOCIAL SCIENCE AUTHORIZATION ALLOWS A TEACHER TO TEACH OTHER SIMILAR CONTENT AREAS SUCH AS ANTHROPOLOGY CONTEMPORARY ISSUES OF CULTURAL STUDIES INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT SOCIOLOGY AND HUMANITY. ARE CURRENTLY CLOSE TO FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND VALID AN ACTIVE SINGLE pHAVE THE SOCIAL SCIENCE AUTHORIZATION. EDUCATORS THAT DID NOT INITIALLY EARNED THEIR CREDENTIALS SOCIAL SCIENCES ALWAYS ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF ADDING THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AUTHORIZATION THROUGH THE COMPLETION OF THE SUBJECT MATTER REQUIREMENTS AND OF COURSE IN THE TEACHING METHODS PERSONAL WORK WITH SOCIAL SCIENCES. IN ORDER TO EARN A CREDENTIAL AUTHORIZING SOCIAL SCIENCE TEACHER PREPARATION CANDIDATE MUST DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY TO TEACH TO STATE ADOPTED CONTENT STANDARD. BY HELPING STUDENTS UNDERSTAND EVENTS AND PERIODS FROM MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES USING PRIMARY SOURCES CULTURAL ARTIFACTS WORKS OF ART AND LITERATURE. THEIR PREPARATION HOPES TO GUIDE. IN UNDERSTANDING INSIGHTS INTO HISTORICAL PERIODS AND CULTURES. AND DINNER STANDINGS OF PEOPLE EVENTS AND DEBATES TWO THEMES CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES. AND RELATED SOCIAL SCIENCE CONTENT TO BROADER CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDINGS SO THAT STUDENTS BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR CURRENT WORLD. BUT WHEN I'M GOING TO TURN THIS FOR TO MY COLLEAGUE DAVID WHO'S GOING TO GO INTO A BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE PREPARATION AND SUBJECT MATTER APARTMENTS FOR TEACHERS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES. EVEN BIGGER AND MY NAME IS DAVID TO HERE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. OUR DIVISION DEVELOP STANDARDS FOR ALL POTENTIAL AREAS WE PROGRAMS. OVERSEAS REQUIRED EDUCATOR PREPARATION EXAMS AND ASSESSMENTS. AND REVIEWS AND ACCREDITS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. AND LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT OFFER EDUCATOR PREPARATION PROGRAMS SO. THE COMMISSION HAS PROPAGATED A RIGOROUS SET OF TEACHER PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS ALSO KNOWN AS TPP EIGHTIES. I'M BUT CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS FOR THE TEACHING PROFESSION. THESE EXPECTATIONS RANGE FROM THE GENERAL ABILITY OF A TEACHER TO ENGAGE IN SUPPORT ALL STUDENTS IN LEARNING. ASSESSING STUDENT LEARNING TIPS SUBJECT SPECIFIC PEDAGOGY EXPECTATIONS. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES POTENTIAL THAT ARE RELATED TO PASS NEXT OUTING. BEGINNING TEACHERS ASK QESTIONS INSTRUCTURE ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION TO HELP STUDENTS RECOGNIZE IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS AND SUBJECTIVITY IMPOSTORA CLASS ACTORS. THEY TEACH STUDENTS HOW CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES INFORM INFLUENCE UNDERSTANDINGS OF HISTORY. THANK HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THE RANSOM CARE IT'S FROM MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES ARE USING PRIMARY SOURCES SIMULATIONS CASE STUDIES CULTURAL ARTIFACTS WORKS OF LITERATURE WHAT PROJECTS STUDENT RESEARCH ACTIVITY. THEY CREATE PUNISHMENT FIREMAN'S THAT SUPPORT THE DISCUSSION OF SENSITIVE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE SOCIAL CULTURAL RELIGIOUS RACE GENDER ISSUES AND ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO REFLECT ON AND SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS AND VALUES. THEY WORK TO UNDERSTAND BATES CRITICALLY ANALYZESOCIAL SCIENCE ISSUES DATA RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS FROM MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES. EXISTENCE STATUTE THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT CREDENTIALED TEACHERS WITH A SOCIAL SCIENCES AUTHORIZATION ARE SUFFICIENTLY PREPARED TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. THAT'S DIRECTORS SCHOOL AND I HOPEFULLY KILEY. TEACHING EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CREDENTIALED TEACHERS ON THE STANDARDS FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AUTHORIZATION. RISEN UP TO ENCOMPASS THE PRESS I THINK STATE'S CURRICULUM. THE COMMITTEE KNOWS ETHNIC STUDIES IN CALIFORNIA IS CENTERED UP A LOCAL LEVELS. WITHIN THE REGIONAL DISTRICTS MAKING THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEIR ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAM LOOK FUNNY. THE SOCIAL SCIENCE AUTHORIZATION IS AN IDEAL BUT THE SITUATION AS IT PREPARES TEACHERS TO TAKE UP NEW CURRICULA IN SOCIAL SCIENCES TEACH. THAT'S THE LEGISLATURE DISCUSSES HOW TO BEST PREPARE CALIFORNIA FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ONE A ONE. EXPECT QUESTIONS MAY BE RAISED ABOUT PROVIDING FOR A SPECIFIC FINANCIAL FOR ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS. THE COMMISSION CANNOT BEGIN ANY SUCH WORK WITHOUT EXPRESS STATUTORY AUTHORITY FROM THE STATE INCLUDING RESOURCES WE WOULD NEED TO DO SUCH WORK. WHICH IT IS CURRENTLY. THE DOCTOR KNEW EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR CREDENTIALS AS WELL AS ADMINISTERING NEW GRANTS. UNTIL SEPT JOHNSON HAS BEEN GIVEN THE COMMISSION SOMETIME TO SAY WHAT IMPACT LIKE STUDIES POTENTIAL MIGHT LOOK LIKE. ESPECIALLY WITHOUT DISCUSSION WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS AND THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TODAY THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS IMPORTANT TASK WE ARE PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. GO TO THE- THE DIETS FOR QUESTIONS. ANY ANY QUESTIONS I'D I'D CERTAINLY DO- THANK YOU CHOI. I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD BE THE BEST PERSON TO ANSWER BUT THE MOST LIKELY A DOCTOR MIGHT TO TORRES COULD ANSWER REGARDING THE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK- AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING STATEMENT- IF YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY ANSWER. WHETHER THIS IS A BE A- ONE SEMESTER COURSE SO WANT ONE YEAR. AND ONE IS- DUST DETERMINED THAT YOU MAY HAVE- CLASSROOM HOURS AND THE HOW MANY. ETHNIC STUDIES SO WOULD BE- COVERED IN THAT CURRICULUM. AND HOW THE TIME WOULD BE LOCATED HOW IT WILL BE ALLOCATED TO. OBVIOUSLY. SOMEONE POSSIBLE THEORY MAY BE BASED UPON- THE LONGER HISTORY WHAT THE POPULATION- SUCH AS- NATIVE INDIANS SO I HAVE A LONG HISTORY IS TORY. BUT THAT THE A POPULATION SO NOT MANY S. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RANK WILL BE- FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR BLACK HISTORY- HISPANIC HISTORY ETHNIC STUDIES SO- A PREDOMINANT- NICK- MINORITIES. AND THE ASIANS TO MEET FOLLOW AND- HOW THE TIME WOULD BE SLICE THE WHAT- AMANO WITH TIME WILL BE ALLOCATED TO EACH ETHNIC STUDIES TO. THEN THE EDUCATORS SCHOOLS TO DEVELOPING MORROW- MODERN CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK AND THE CONTENT THEY MAKE A SUGGESTION WHAT TO BE INCLUDED. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF VICE CHAIR CHOI FOR THE QUESTIONS- SO THE- THE FIRST QUESTION WAS HOW LONG- IS THE ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE REQUIREMENT- WITH RESPECT TO AB ONE ON ONE AND THAT ANSWER IS- ONE MASTER IS PARDONED. HOWEVER IN L. EA CAN EXPAND THAT TO AS LONG AS THE FULL A FULL SCHOOL YEAR- AS FAR AS THE QUESTION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES- AND AS YOU ADVOCATED BY THE EXAMPLE OF SPLITTING UP THE PRO FOR. CHECK FRANK REPRESENTATION OF IS OF THE STUDENT BODY POPULATION THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT- TO MAKE THAT CHOICE- THE MODEL CURRICULUM WAS DESIGNED SUCH THAT THEY CAN PULL OUT THE DIFFERENT PIECES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE STUDENTS AND THEIR- AND THEN AND THEN FROM THERE AND UPON UPON WHOSE ARE THE ELEMENTS FROM THE MODEL CURRICULUM SO THAT IT IS RELEVANT TO THE STUDENTS WERE SITTING. I ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OF DR TORTOISE I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- MAYBE FIRST OFF- DOCTOR TO ORDERS- UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STATE'S POPULATION MAY DIFFER FROM ONE STATE TO THE AND GIVEN THAT DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY. TO BEST ADAPT I THINK STUDIES CLASSES TO THEIR OWN POPULATION THAT IS NOT TO SAY. IF I UNDERSTAND AND I HOPE THAT I AM CORRECT IN THIS THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE- YOU KNOW. PREROGATIVE TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW THIS. X. GROUP WHATEVER THAT GROUP MIGHT BE- DOESN'T EXIST OR OR OR NOT IN BIG NUMBERS IN THIS PART OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR IN THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AT IGNORE ANY OF THE FOUR GROUPS THAT ARE THE BASIS OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES OR WHAT WE HAVE CALLED THE FOUNDATIONS ARE THE PILLARS OF MY CORRECT IN THAT ASSUMPTION. QUESTION TO DOCTOR TOWARDS. THANK YOU- THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION- SO LOOKING AT THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB ONE OH ONE- IT ACTUALLY IS NOT SPECIFIED IN THEIR THE SPECIFIC ETHNICITIES WHICH NEED TO BE REPRESENTED IN THE ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE IN FACT ONE OF THE FOUR- ONE OF THE FOUR WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE COURSE REQUIREMENT. GIVES TEAMS THE ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM WHICH IS BASED ON THOSE FOR- ETHNICITIES- THE OTHERS ARE. TAKING SATISFIED WITH AN EXISTING ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE- AGAIN IT'S NOT WHICH THE STAFF MISSED TO BE REPRESENTED AND THAT- THE THIRD IS AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE TAUGHT AS PART OF A COURSE THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED AS MEDIATED G. REQUIREMENTS- AND THEN THE FOURTH IS A LOCALLY DEVELOPED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. FOR THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL NOW CURRICULUM ITSELF ENCOURAGES SCHOOLS TO INCLUDE DESCRIPTIONS ON. THAT MAKE YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE HE'S OF STUDENTS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND FOUR MAIN GROUPS- THAT WAY CHIR CHOI HAD JUST- THERE ARE SIX OF THE ETHNIC SAID MODEL. THANK INTO- OTHER- ANOTHER DRIVER POPULATIONS BEYOND THOSE FOUR YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE. AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AFTER LONG DISCUSSION MANY YEARS- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT WHAT ETHNIC STUDIES IS THE STUDY. OF HISTORICAL GROUPS THAT HAVE POPULATED THE UNITED STATES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT IF IT WILL DISTRICT DECIDED TO OFFER A CLASS IN STATE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES OR ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES. A STANDALONE CLASS THAT CLASS WOULD- FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE THE POINT THAT I DO NOT THINK. THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT AS- A GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SAY WELL THIS GROUP OR THAT GROUP ESPECIALLY ONE OF THOSE FOR A GROUP. AT THE- MEDIA. HE PRESENTED THAT THE JUST THE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE- I HAVE A QUESTION TO- I THINK. OF MR DWYER FROM DIRECTOR OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. DID I. I I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHERS THAT THE CREDENTIAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOOD BURKE. YOU'RE NOT IMPLYING THAT ALL THOSE SOCIAL STUDIES. TEACHERS HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OR CAPABILITY OF TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES. IS THAT CORRECT. SO CRYSTALS THAT I BELIEVE ALMOST FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY KIND OF DIFFICULT TO HEAR OKAY I'M DIRECTORS WHO WILL TESTIFY THAT IT'S ALMOST FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND TEACHERS WHO HOLD THE- SOCIAL STUDIES SINGLE SUBJECT OUR CREDENTIALS. WE DO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A BROAD BASED CREDENTIAL THAT- THE TEACHERS ARE PREPARED TO. TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES HOWEVER BECAUSE EACH DISTRICT OR EACH CHARTER SCHOOL WILL BE- DEVELOPING THEIR OWN CURRICULUM THERE IS LIKELY ADDITIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR TEACHERS. IN MANY OR MOST DISTRICTS. SO IF A TEACHER WHO TEACHES A PHYSICS AND A HIGH SCHOOL- HAS A SCIENCE CREDENTIAL IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH RIGHT I HAVE TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL SO IT IF I'M A PHYSICS TEACHER AT MY HIGH SCHOOL AND I HAVE A SCIENCE CREDENTIAL. DOES THAT MAKE ME- QUALIFIED. TO TEACH CHEMISTRY AT THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL AND MAYBE THE CREDENTIAL IS. MAYBE THE SCIENCE CREDENZA. MAKES ME QUALIFIED BUT IF I AM THE PRINCIPLE OF THAT HIGH SCHOOL DO I NECESSARILY WANT. A PHYSICS TEACHER TO TEACH BIOLOGY IF THEY'RE QUALIFIED YES BUT IF THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF BIOLOGY- WHAT I WANT. THE PHYSICS TEACHER TEACHING THAT CLASS. OR IF I TEACH CALCULUS. AT I'M A MATH TEACHER AND I'M TEACHING CALCULUS DOES THAT MAKE ME QUALIFIED TO TEACH CHEMISTRY AARON TO TALK MORE ABOUT- WHAT TEACHERS ARE ALLOWED TO TEACH- BECAUSE THAT'S FOR HER DIVISION YOU CANNOT I I'M- I'M GONNA KINDA. I RESPECTFULLY ANSWER MY OWN QUESTION AND THAT IS I DON'T BELIEVE THE ASSUMPTION IF IT IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT- THE COMMISSION ON CREDENTIALING IS MAKING AYE AYE I DO NOT ACCEPT THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE WHATEVER NUMBER OF SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHERS THAT WHOLE CREDENTIALS IN SOCIAL STUDIES ARE QUALIFIED TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES AND I THINK AS MY COLLEAGUE HERE MR SANTIAGO WHO HAD TO LEAVE EARLIER SAID THE PART OF WHAT THE REASON FOR THIS HEARING. IS THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THAT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE TEACHING OF ETHNIC STUDIES UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE I WAS IN THE CLASSROOM AND IN A HIGH SCHOOL FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO THE TEACHER. ALL WHO HAVE BEEN TEACHING SOCIAL STUDIES- HISTORICALLY. ETHNIC STUDIES WILL FAIL. BECAUSE THOSE TEACHERS ARE NOT QUALIFIED DO NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE SOME OF THEM. ACTUALLY DENY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED I REMEMBER TEACHING ABOUT THE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT- WALKOUTS OF EAST LA BY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ONE OF MY STUDENTS GOING TO HER US HISTORY. TEACHER AND HER US HISTORY TEACHER TELLING HER EITHER DIDN'T HAPPEN OR WAS NOT IMPORTANT SO- I REJECT THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE WHATEVER FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND TEACHERS THAT HOLD SOCIAL STUDIES CREDENTIAL THAT THEY ARE IN ANY WAY- QUALIFIED TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT- AND ANOTHER QUESTION PERHAPS TO DR TORTOISE DR TORTOISE ULTIMATELY. WHO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT WE HAVE QUALIFIED TEACHERS TO TEACH ETHICS. DOT PRESS. SO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THAT WE HAVE QUALIFIED TEACHERS- FALLS ON THE WILLIAMS ACT AND- THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION DO YOU MONITOR- WITH RESPECT TO WILLIAMS. WITH TEACHER CREDENTIALING AS WELL AS TEXTBOOKS SUFFICIENCY. AND THEN MAYBE MY LAST QUESTION- ENGLISH TEACHERS RIGHT A TEACHERS OF A LANGUAGE ARTS. ARE THEY- THAT WOULD SOME OF THEM ALSO BE ABLE TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES. I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. OKAY INTO THEM QUESTION- NO THEY WOULD NOT BE AUTHORIZED TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES BECAUSE- THE ENGLISH AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT HAVE THT CONTENT AREAS SUBSUMED WITHIN THAT THE BROAD STATUTORY SUBJECT OF ENGLISH. BUT IF THE DISTRICT TAUGHT A CLASS LIKE. LATINO LITERATURE OR AFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE IN IN THAT IN THAT CASE THE TEACHER WOULD BE IS THAT CORRECT. IF A SCHOOL DELIBERATELY INCITED TO TEACH A CLASS WHICH I BELIEVE THERE ARE ALREADY IN EXISTENCE A CLASS LIKE. NATIVE AMERICAN LITERATURE OR AFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE ASIAN AMERICAN LITERATURE LATINO LITERATURE WOULDN'T THE TEACHER WHO HOLDS AN ENGLISH. CREDENTIAL THEN BE QUALIFIED TO TEACH SUCH CLASS. THE COULD BE IT DEPENDS ON HOW THAT CLASS WITH COLLUDED- FOR THE CALCUTTA STATE REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND THAT. STATE COURTS COULD THAT IT WAS ASSIGNED SO THEY COULD BE OKAY. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WEBER YOUR COMMENTS I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE WHO WITH TO JUST HAVE THE BASIC SOCIAL SCIENCE TEACHING CREDENTIAL- WITHOUT HAVING ANY FURTHER TRAINING SPECIFICALLY TO ETHNIC STUDIES HAVE TO TEACH AT THE NEXT. SHOULD BE ON THE ONES TEACHING OUR KIDS ETHNIC STUDIES I AM I AM NEWER TO THE LEGISLATIVE FIVE I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S NOT READY TO CONNECT CRAFTED ON- ETHNIC STUDIES- CURRICULUM I THINK WE HAVE STANDARDIZED SCIENCE WHEN WE HAVE ENTERED AYE CORRECT WE HAVE STANDARDIZED AMERICAN HISTORY CURRICULUM IN SEOUL- ALLOWING YOU KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO- DO THIS WITH ETHNICS DAY IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING HOWEVER IF WE'RE GOING TO DO IT LIKE I SAID EARLIER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT. AND IT STARTS WITH MAKING SURE THAT THE TEACHERS WHO ARE TEACHING IT REALLY UNDERSTAND AND KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING AND HOW TO TEACH IT THANK YOU. THANK THANK THANK YOU- WHEN WE DELVE INTO A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICS- I WOULD LIKE TO ORDER SO EMPHASIZE THAT SOMETIMES SO. ASIAN SLASH OF PACIFIC ISLANDERS I'LL ROUTE THIS ONE. HOWEVER THIS BUT THE KILLER ETHNIC GROUP IS- TO MY VIEW MOST OF DIVERSE IF WE CATEGORIZED TO SELECT THAT LATINO OR HISPANIC. I'LL JUST SAY IT HAS A MORE COMMONALITY. SPEAKING SPANISH AND OTHER SIMILAR CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND THE BLACK ETHNIC STUDIES SO. IT IS A VERY SPECIAL ONE GROUP. BUT THE AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE ASIA ASIA IS. HOW DOES A VERY UNIQUE- FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT IS A NOT ONE RATIO WE MAY LOOK OUR ALLY MANY SAY YOU ALL LOOK ALIKE I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT HOW AND IN FACT THEY CANNOT TELL IT WHEN THE I COME FROM CHINESE CHINESE BACKGROUND OF KOREAN THAT BROWN JAPANESE BACKGROUND IT EVEN SO I CAN TELL A LITTLE BIT IN ALL OF MY LIFE IS ON TIME SO- HOWEVER- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO'S NOT HERE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOLE- ORDER ORDER GET MAD AT ME. IF WE LUMP SUM CHINESE CULTURE INTO KOREAN ETHNIC BACKGROUND. YEAH WHAT. JAPANESE TO KOREAN CULTURE EVEN THOUGH WE LOOK ALIKE. AND WE SHARE A VERY THAT NAZARIAN RELATIONSHIP JAPAN OCCUPIED KOREA FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS TO C. LEVEL INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS NOT NOT SO GOOD AND THE VERY UNIQUELY DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT THEY EVEN TRIED TO CLAIM OUR CURRENT CULTURE IN SA FOR CHINESE SELEKA I- CELEBRATED INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION TEAM TO DAY LAST YEAR. CHINESE ARE CLAIMING KIM SHE'S SO CHINESE WOMAN. IN ALL THINGS LIKE THAT EVEN KOREAN TRADITIONAL CLOSE'S CHINESE CLOTHES AND THE KOREAN PEOPLE GET SO MAD. THEY MAY CLAIM BTS AS THE LIGHT LIKE A CHINESE SO OF POPULAR CULTURE HOST ON THE I DON'T KNOW. SO THE KOREAN AMERICANS HAVE A VERY POSSESSIVE- A- CHARACTER- THAT THE WEEK CONTRIBUTED. I DON'T KNOW IN THIS ROOM HOW MANY pSEVEN E. DR SAM IN THE- YOU MAY KNOWN. NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT THAT HE WAS A MEDICAL DOCTOR HE HE COULD NOT. PRACTICE- EVEN YOU MEAN CORTISOL I UNDERSTAND HE PRACTICES HIS DIVING INTO THE SAND. AND HE WAS A- TWO TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST A AS A- KOREAN AMERICAN HE WON THE TITLE FOR AMERICAN AWFUL PRIA HE HAPPENED TO. COME FROM KOREA SO IF- JAPANESE UP NEXT TO IT IS- INTRODUCES IT YOU KNOW THAT THE CULTURE- CONTRIBUTED- TO AMERICAN IN ALL CULTURAL OR HISTORY OF WHY CHEAP MUCH IN ALL NO HE WAS NOT UPPER EAST SIDE SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE SO ANYWAY AS YOU CAN HEAR WITH THE THREE DIFFERENT BUT THAT THERE ARE SOME VIETNAMESE INTEL- NATION ERA. EVEN EVEN SOMETIMES UP INDIA IS A CLASSIFIED AS UP THE SHOT PACIFIC ISLANDERS A HAWAII AND SO HORRIBLY DIFFERENT GROUP OF ASIANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS A ONE LUMP SUM GROUP. SO IN THIS- NEXT- CURRICULUM FRAME. AT THE SLICING THAT TIME- TO L. OKAY DEATH ASIA A ONE LUMP SUM GROUP IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. THERE HAS TO BE SPECIFIC GROUP LIKE I HAD MENTIONED. AS A FROM A PERSON WHO KNOWS TO A DISTINCTIVE DIFFERENCES SO I'M JUSTICE STAYING THERE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE. THANK YOU DR CHOI ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BUT MAYBE TO CLOSE THIS PANEL OUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M REALLY. DISAPPOINTED FROM WHAT I'M HEARING IN IN THIS PANEL. WE HAVE A LAW THAT WE HAVE PASSED IN THE LEGISLATURE. THAT STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY THE YEAR TWENTY NINE THIRTY WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT BUT I HAVE HEARD NOTHING IN THE PRESENTATION. THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER LICENSING ISN'T ANYWAY ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING TO PREPARE FOR THAT. TO THINK THAT THE TEACHERS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE QUALIFIED TO TEACH ANY OF THESE CLASSES IS A MISTAKE. AND AS I THINK MY COLLEAGUE. MR SANTIAGO SAY IT WOULD BE A TRAGIC MISTAKE BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY DOOMED TO FAILURE. ETHNIC STUDIES WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO OTHER PANELS AND I THINK AND I WOULD TELL THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE ACADEMICS THAT ARE GOING TO BE HERE TO THE FOLKS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN UC AND CSU TO THE FOLKS FROM DEPARTMENT OF AT STUDIES. IN UC CSU. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND TO HEAR FROM THEM WHAT THEIR IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL OPINION. IS REQUIRED OF THE TEACHER. IN A HIGH SCHOOL TO BE COMPETENT TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES WITH THAT I THANK THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR TIME AND FOR BEING HERE AND I AM GOING TO BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL STATE UNIVERSITY DIRECTOR FOR CAL STATE TEACH. KLAUDIA MARTINEZ UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATOR PROGRAMS AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND DR JIRO HILL ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. AT PACIFIC SPOKES COLLEGE AND SO- DOCTOR HILL I THINK YOU THE ONLY ONE HERE IN PERSON- AND I WILL START WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND WE'LL START WITH DR ERNEST BLACK IF HE'S READY TO PRESENT. REMOTELY. DR BLACK ARE YOU THERE READY. AND WELCOME. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO EVERYONE I APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION. SO I AM EARNERS BLACK I AM ONE OF THE DIRECTORS AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATOR PREPARATION A PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND THE SYSTEM MY DIRECTOR FOR CAL STATE TEACH. AN ONLINE MULTIPLE SUBJECT TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY HAS A STRONG INTEREST IN DEVELOPING EDUCATORS WHO WILL BE PREPARED TO ENGAGE K. TWELVE STUDENTS AND ETHNIC STUDIES. THROUGH A DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION LANDS. CURRENTLY I AM THE CHAIR OF THE CSU COLLEGE OF EDUCATION DEAN'S. DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION GROUP. THIS GROUP WAS FORMED TWO YEARS AGO TO TAKE A CRITICAL LOOK. AT THE EDUCATOR PREPARATION PROGRAMS WITH IN THE CSU AND DETERMINE HOW WE AT THE SYSTEM COULD BE MORE INCLUSIVE AND REFLECTIVE OF THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. OUT OF THIS GROUP RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ENCOURAGE ALL EDUCATOR PREPARATION FACULTY. TO PARTICIPATE AND THE D. III CERTIFICATE COURSE. OFFERED THROUGH THE CSU CENTER FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL. DECATUR PREPARATION PROGRAMS ARE C. TE. ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION WITH TO REQUIRE ALL TEACHER PREPARATION CANDIDATES TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE COURSE AND ETHNIC STUDIES AND OR OF COURSE WITH THE DVI LANDS PRIOR TO ADMISSION TO OUR EDUCATOR PREPARATION PROBABLY DON'T DOCTOR HILL D. III IF YOU WOULD JUST- SPELL THAT OUT FORCE. ADVERSITY I EQUITY AND INCLUSION THANK YOU THANK YOU. AS WE ARE ALL AWARE THEY ARE SLIGHTLY OVER SIX MILLION T. K. TWELVE STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVER 70% OF THOSE STUDENTS IDENTIFY AS AFRICAN AMERICAN ASIAN OR HISPANIC LATIN NEXT. CONVERSELY 63% OF OUR TEACHERS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES WHITE. AN INCLUSION OF ETHNIC STUDIES ALLOWS OUR TEACHERS TO GAIN THE KNOWLEDGE TO EMBRACE AND INVOLVED IN OUR CURRENT STUDENT POPULATION. THIS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TEACHERS TO UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES OF CULTURE AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING CULTURE AND TWO OF THE STUDENTS INTO THE CLASSROOM. BACKER RESULT IN MORE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND ULTIMATELY HIGHER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. BY PREPARING TEACHER CANDIDATES TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES WE ARE PREPARING OUR NEWEST TEACHERS TO TAKE EXISTING AND DEVELOPING CORRECTIVE I. AM BUILT A GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND COMMUNICATION ACROSS ETHNIC DIFFERENCES YES WILL SHOP OUR COMMONALITIES BUT ALSO EMBRACE. OUR DIFFERENCES. PORTENTS FOR OUR TEACHERS IS TO SHOW THAT AND BEFORE THE COMMUNITIES WHERE OUR STUDENTS LEYVA. IT BRINGS THE COMMUNITY INTO THE CLASSROOM AND EXEMPLIFIES OUR SHARED GOAL ARE SHORT COMMUNITY GO WHICH IS OUR STUDENTS. THE IMPORTANCE FOR OUR STUDENTS TO THINK THEY FEEL SEEN HEARD AND ENCOURAGED IN CLASSROOMS. ALLOWS THEM TO ACHIEVE ACADEMICALLY AND SOCIALLY AND TO BECOME EQUITABLE AND PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. TO THIS END THE CSU HAS CURRENTLY NAY IS CURRENTLY MAKING GREAT STRIDES TO ENSURE EDUCATOR CANDIDATES. HAVE A STRONG FOUNDATION TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES SOME OF THIS WORK IS FOCUSED ON THE UNDERGRADUATE CREDENTIAL LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE CSU FULLERTON IS DEVELOPING AN UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR URBAN LEARNING FOCUSED ON WHAT IS CALLED JUST EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE EDUCATION R. J. E. ID. WHICH WAS RECENTLY APPROVED BY THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS BUT MAJOR HAVE SIX CLASSES ALL FOCUSED ON SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ANTI RACIST TEACHING. IN ADDITION IT IS INTERDISCIPLINARY WITH CLASSES FROM WOMEN AND GENDER STUDIES AS WELL AS ETHNIC STUDIES. THIS WILL BE FOR THE FUTURE MULTIPLE SUBJECTS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND THE FIRST COHORT WILL BEGAN IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. ADDITIONALLY ADDITION OFF ENTERING CREDENTIALS STUDENTS EXHIBITION FLOOR TEN MONTHS RIGHT A. J. D. I. E. STATEMENT. ALONG WITH THEIR CREDENTIAL APPLICATIONS. CSU LOS ANGELES HAPPEN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM AND URBAN LEARNING THAT HAS JUST BEEN REVISED TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC COURSEWORK AND ETHNIC STUDIES A COP CANNOT USE ME CREDICO G. N. ALSO INCLUDES REQUIRED ETHNIC STUDIES EDUCATION COURSES. UNIVERSITY'S COLLEGE OF ETHNIC STUDIES. IN ADDITION TO THE CHARTER COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AT CSU LOS ANGELES THE COLLEGE OF ETHNIC STUDIES AT CAL STATE LA. IS AN INTEGRATED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS WHEN THE BE A PROGRAM FOR CHICANO AND LATINO STUDIES. AND THIS INTEGRATED PROGRAM ALLOWS FOR STUDENTS TO EARN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND FOUR YEARS. SAN JOSE STATE HAS ESTABLISHED THE ETHNIC STUDIES RESIDENCY PROGRAM BETWEEN SAN JOSE STATE LOTTERY COLLEGE OF EDUCATION. AND HE'S UNION HIGH SCHOOL IN SAN JOSE SO CANDIDATES FOR THE SINGLE SUBJECT SUCH HISTORY SOCIAL SCIENCE PROVINCIAL ARE INVITED TO APPLY AND SELECTIVELY ADMITTED TO THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM BASED ON THEIR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF AT EXPECTS- OR ONE OF ITS SUBFIELDS EMPIRE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH YOU. ESPECIALLY AND ONE EIGHTH ALIGNED WITH CORE PRINCIPLES OF ETHNIC STUDIES SUCH AS ELEVATING STUDENT AND COMMUNITY VOICES ENGAGING AND CURRENT ISSUES OF SOCIAL INEQUITY AND WITH YOU. CSU LONG BEACH IS ALSO WORKING WITH ITS ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENTS TO CREATE FORCES FOR CREDENTIAL STUDENTS. WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO CREATE WOW IS THAT WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE TEACHERS ARE ENGAGED WITH THE- POLICE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP SCHOOL LEADERS WITH THAT SAME MINDSET TO BACK AND CSU FULLERTON REQUIRES ALL AND THREE MASTERS AND EDT STUDENTS. ARE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE AND IT JUST EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE ORIENTATION WHICH IS A HALF DAY EDUCATION ETHNIC STUDIES WORKSHOP. AND INCLUDE A FOLLOW UP EVENT ALL AND ALL FACULTY AND STAFF IN THE COLLEGE OF ED. HAPPENING CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ON GOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND A VARIETY OF JT I AREAS. CSU LOS ANGELES HAS A MASTERS COURSE AND RESEARCH METHODS ETHNICS BADDIES DOMINGUEZ HILL HILLS OFFERS A MASTER'S COURSE IN ETHNIC STUDIES. AN EDUCATION WHILE ALSO DEVELOPING A NEW MINOR THAT WILL BE THAT WILL CREATE A PATHWAY FROM ETHNIC STUDIES WITH SINGLE SUBJECT EDUCATION PROGRAM. SAN JOSE STATE IS HOPEFUL THAT THEIR NEWLY CREATED SPARTAN ACCELERATED GRADUATE EDUCATION PATHWAY. WELL ALLOW UNDERGRADUATES TO MAJOR AND- AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES AND OUR CHICANO STUDIES AND SIMULTANEOUSLY START TAKING THEIR COURSE WORK TOWARD THEIR CREDENTIAL AND A MASTER FARTS AND TEACHING AND THAT WILL HELP INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TEACHER CANDIDATES COMING INTO THE COLLEGE OF ED WITH THE ETHNIC STUDIES BACKGROUND. AND SIMILARLY MARKET ON A PARTNERSHIP WITH SAN JOSE SO THE CITY COLLEGE ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT AND WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY ARTICULATED. A ASSOCIATES DEGREE ENTER THAT PATHWAY. FINALLY REACHING TO THE FUTURE SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE CREATED A PATH TO DEVELOP FUTURE TEACHERS. COME TO COLLEGE WITH AN EQUITY LANDS. CSU FULLERTON HAS DEVELOPED A PROGRAM CALLED TITAN FUTURE TEACHERS. THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON J. E. I. E. THE PROGRAM IS FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN ALL MAJORS ACROSS CAMPUS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED ANY INTEREST IN BECOMING A TEACHER. THERE THERE ARE CURRENTLY APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP CSU LOS ANGELES HAS CREATED THE BALLOT CAST BROKE URBAN TEACHER LEADER ACADEMY. A PARTICIPATE THEY ANTICIPATE THAT THE PARTICIPANTS WILL BE INTERESTED IN PREPARING. TO BE A TEACHER LEADER FOR THE ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT. CSU LONG BEACH IS DEVELOPING A LATIN ACCENT TO FORGET FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS THROUGH THEIR HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION TEACHER PREP GRANT AND WHAT SEVERAL OF THE STUDENTS. WHO WILL PURSUE THE DEATH CERTIFICATE ARE CONSIDERING TEACHING. AS A CAREER LIST THUS THE ISSUE COMMUNITY OF COLLEGES OF EDUCATION INSPIRE EACH OTHER TO BECOME MORE PROFICIENT IN THIS AREA. IN ADDITION TO RCS COLLEGES OF EDUCATION P. E. I. EACH DAY AND HAS AGREED TO BEGAN REFUELING WHAT OUR COLLEGES HAVE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE AND THAT'S THE ISSUE INSTITUTIONS TO SEE WHAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT WITHIN OUR OWN PROGRAMS. AND I THINK THAT WAS- AMOUNT FOR BUT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING AT IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DR BLACK NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM CLAUDIA MARTINEZ UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATOR PROGRAMS AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. MISS MARTINEZ WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. OKAY.

MANY OF ARE YOU SEE TEACHER AT PROGRAMS. HAVE DEVELOPED NEW ETHNIC STUDIES CONCENTRATIONS AND- PATHWAYS FROM THE MULTIPLE AND SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES. DEVELOPING CURRICULUM THAT I'M BAD SPECIFIC COURSES IN ETHNIC STUDIES FIELD PLACEMENTS WITH EXPERIENCE K. TWELVE ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS AND COLLABORATIONS AND MENTORING OPPORTUNITIES WITH UNIVERSITY ETHNIC STUDIES FACULTY. UTILITIES TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE HAS ESTABLISHED AN ETHNIC STUDIES PATHWAY- HAD ESTABLISHED ITH OTHER STUDIES PATHWAY FOR THE TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT'S ADOPTION AT THAT TIME OF AN ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. THAT'S THEIR ADMISSIONS PROCESS THEY DO A REVIEW OF TRANSCRIPTS ADMIT STUDENTS. IN THE CORPORATE WHO ARE LOOKING. I'M LOOKING THE- ACADEMIC PEPPER IN THE ETHICS OR GENDER FEEL. THEY'RE JUST AMENDED THEIR EIGHT COHORT OF STUDENTS AND BY THE END OF THE THIS ACADEMIC YEAR WILL HAVE CREDENTIALS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE SECONDARY TEACHERS WITH IT AT THAT THAT'S AN ETHNIC STUDIES EMPHASIS. ON THESE ARE ALL CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES THROUGH SPECIALIZED COURSEWORK AND STUDENT TEACHING PLACEMENTS. UC'S TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING LEADERSHIP IN THE PREPARATION OF ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS IN WAYS THAT GO BEYOND IMPLEMENTED CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT. JUST THIS WEEK UCLA IS LAUNCHING AN ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHER EDUCATION COOPERATIVE WHICH IS PRICED A TEACHER EDUCATORS NOT ONLY FROM THE UC BUT ALSO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES JUST SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO BUILD PATHWAYS TO PREPARE. ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS AND ALSO AT UCLA AT THEIR ETHNIC STUDIES CENTERS AND SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION AND UCLA EXTENSION ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE AN ETHNIC STUDIES CERTIFICATE. PROGRAM FOR PRACTICING TEACHERS ARE ENGAGED IN AND THE TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF COURSES AND CURRICULUM- INCLUDED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAP PIPELINE AND PATHWAY PROGRAMS FOR UNDERGRADUATE PRINTED AND POTENTIAL STUDENT CANDIDATES TO PURSUE TEACHING IN ETHNIC STUDIES. FOR EXAMPLE UC SANTA BARBARA HAS THE EXCEED A PROGRAM WHICH STANDS FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE INCLUSIVE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES WHICH IS A CLEARLY STRUCTURED PATHWAY FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO BECOME CERTIFIED K. TWELVE ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS. OTHER UC CAMPUSES ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN THIS WORK- AND YOU'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY LATER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT UC RIVERSIDE'S MODEL ETHNIC STUDIES PATH WITH TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM. INTERVIEW RED WILL ADDRESS COMMITTEE DURING THREE- SO YOU'LL THE OPPORTUNITY HERE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A DEEP DIVE INTO HOW THEY STRUCTURE THEIR PROGRAM- THE SEVEN ARENA WHICH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S CONTRIBUTING TO PREPARING TEACHERS TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES IS IN THE SUPPORT OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FOR TO CONTINUING TEACHERS. I'M AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS BEING ADDRESSED IN THE EARLIER ON IN THE EARLIER DISCUSSION. THIS WORK IS BEING PRIMARILY CONDUCTED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT THE STATE'S INTEREST SEGMENTAL NETWORK OF TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL DISCIPLINES. I WITH RECENT FUNDING FROM THE STATE THIS CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT IS SPONSORING SEVERAL ETHNIC STUDIES FOCUSED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS INSTITUTES AND SEMINARS FOR TEACHERS AND REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALL OF WHICH ARE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH. INFORMED BY THE MOST RECENT RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY UNIVERSITY HISTORY AND ETHNIC STUDIES SCHOLARS AND EXPERTS. MOST NOTABLY THE CALIFORNIA HISTORY SOCIAL SCIENCE PROJECT ONE OF THE NOT CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS HAS BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF. SPECIAL TO ME BECAUSE FOR.

I. C. C. U. FORTY OF THEM OFFERED TEACHER EDUCATION AND PREPARATION- I FEEL LIKE WE ARE DEFINITELY PULLING ARE. DOING OUR PART TO. REDUCE HE TEACHER SHORTAGE BECAUSE WE PRODUCE. PERCENT OF ALL NEW TEACHERS TO THE PROFESSION- AGAIN A LOT OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE REALLY GROUNDED IN SOCIAL JUSTICE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION. AND HOW WE TRY TO FRAME THAT SOCIAL JUSTICE IS REALLY SPEAKING UP FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A VOICE. WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY IS NOT DISCOUNTING PEOPLE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE COUNT. NOT BASED ON THEIR ETHNICITY BY DIVERSITY OF THEIR EXPERIENCES WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY% WE WANT TO. REFOCUS OUR LANDS AND WIDENING OUR CIRCLE SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU KNOW EVERYONE BEING A PART OF THE DECISION MAKING. PROCESS WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT IT. LOOKING AT IT FROM A- OUTSIDE IN- I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL SCHOOL DID. NOT UNIFIED HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR WORK ALREADY ON THEIR STUDENT THINK TANKS WERE IN FACT THAT INVITED STUDENTS TO COME TO MY CAMPUS. TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES AROUND HOW'S IT GOING SO FAR LET ME HEAR. THIS IS NOT. IT THEN IN OUR TEACHER SO WE SEE IT FROM THE OUTSIDE IN IN ORDER FOR US TO DO THIS WORK RIGHT AND WELL. TRANSFORMATION CENTER AND OUR CENTER FOR EDUCATOR DIVERSITY IS TO REALLY ENGAGE THE WORK- FROM A PERSPECTIVE REALLY INVOLVING THE PARENTS AND THE COMMUNITY RIGHT I THINK IT REALLY IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY AND I ALWAYS TELL MY CANDIDATES THAT HISTORY GIVES US THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RIGHTING THE WRONGS OF THE PAST BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO ENGAGE IN OPPRESSION OLYMPICS BECAUSE THAT REALLY DOES FRACTURE SOME OF THE- POSSIBILITIES THAT THIS WORK IS GOING TO DO RIGHT LIKELY TIME THANK. BE MORE THAT THE TABLE FOR US TO REALLY STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- I REALLY DO THINK THAT- WHAT. HERE IT IS TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ASSESS THE WORK PRACTICE AND REALLY INTRODUCE IT I DO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WERE CO CONSTRUCTING THIS KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE IT IS NEW I DO AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO READ. I'M IN HIS TRAINING BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE- INNER P. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. RIGHT I WANT THEM TO HAVE SOME INTENTION AT THE AROUND. THE BURKE SO THAT'S AS A ICC YOU HAVE REALLY CREATED THAT PERSPECTIVE WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE KEY CRITERIA- AS- THIS EDUCATOR PROP. RIGHT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCE YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND CRITICAL HUMILITY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS WORK IS TO GIVE PEOPLE THE BENEFIT OF THEIR HUMANITY. I SEE YOU I HEAR YOU I LOVE YOU I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT LOVE AND JUSTICE KISS EACH OTHER ON THE CHEEK. RIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE GET OF THIS VISIT MINE SAY SO WE TALK ABOUT LOVE JOY AND GENIUS AND PEACE IN THE CLASSROOM THAT'S REALLY THE PARA SHIFT. THAT IS COURSE THE OTHER THING THAT I CAN REALLY ENVISION IS THAT YOUR YOU KNOW THIS LEADERSHIP REQUIRES ACTION AND AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO MATRICULATED DOWN I COULD SEE ETHNIC TAUGHT IN EARLY TODAY TO.

IN OUR WORK. I DO WE CAN BE INVEST SOME OF THE CAR- THE FIRE AND HAVE. THERE CLASROOM WELCOME TO LEARN THOSE SKILLS AROUND YOU KNOW GETTING THEIR PEDAGOGICAL REPERTOIRE AROUND ETHNIC STUDIES BECAUSE IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN OUR STANDARDS SO STUDY CURRICULA BUT I THINK JUST COMING TOGETHER- LOOK AT CALL WAYS MEETING THE NEEDS THERE IT AS THE THAT REALLY BENEFIT EVERYONE INVOLVED IN AND I THINK IT REALLY DOES TAKE IN OVER COLLABORATION TO PULL THIS OFF BECAUSE THE NEEDS ARE GREAT SO WEEKLY WANT TO WAY. OTHER THANKS WE BET THE COMPACT FATIGUE I DON'T LIKE TO THE BURNER BUT I THINK THERE THEY'RE EAGER FOR THIS WORK AS I'VE IS SEVERAL CLASS CLOWNS AND IN. YOU CAN WEIGH IN CONVERT. YOU KNOW STAY TASK FORCE IN THINGS LIKE TO REALLY COME UP WITH THIS EQUITY ETHNIC STUDIES WORK. THANK YOU THANK YOU. DOCTOR HILL DR BLACK PREPARING OUR CURRENT TEACHERS TO BE ABREAST OF ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE DUTIES NEEDED TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES IN OUR CLASSROOMS. OUR TEACHERS MISSION FOR OUR TEACHER CANNOT A FUTURE TEACHER CANDIDATES OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL TEACHER CANDIDATES. ARE REQUIRED BOB BAER CREDENTIALING HAVE THE ABILITY TO TEACH WITH THE ETHNIC STUDIES AND ARE WITHIN. THIRTY AND TWENTY THE. WORDS ONLY SOCIAL SCIENCE. THANK YOU DR BLACK AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AND I SAW ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THIS LAST SUMMER DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION SHIFTING SHIFTING GIVEN THE SEARCH DANCES IT BUT WE HAD EXPERIENCE THE YEAR. SCHIFF GEN OF. WHAT IT IS TO BE A TEACHER AN EFFECTIVE TEACHER SO I FAVOR THAT VERY MUCH- BUT IN WHAT DIRECTION WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THE THREE OF YOU THAT THE DO THE COMMISSION UNCONSCIOUSLY MOVE. AS SPECIFICALLY THE CLASSES OF ETHNICSTUDIES AT THE HIGH SCHOOL. SHOULD BE A CREDENTIAL IN ETHNIC STUDIES SHOULD BE A CONCENTRATION IN ETHNIC STUDIES A SPECIALIZATION WITHIN WHAT DIRECTION SHOULD WE LOOK TO THE COMMISSION. IT ANGELES MOVE BECAUSE I THINK NOT TO DO ANYTHING IS TO THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEING RIGHT NOW SO. IN WHAT DIRECTION SHOULD WE LOOK INTO THE COMMITTEE ON CREDENTIALING MOVING. SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE BEST TEACHERS. TEACHING THE SPECIFIC CLASSES AT OUR HIGH SCHOOLS THAT MEET THE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS YOUR SUGGESTIONS. DR BY BLACK YOU MAY BE. IF I HAD TO SUGGEST I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES WHAT OUT KNOWLEDGE OF ETHNIC STUDIES I WOULD SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT AT THE STATE- I WOULD I. BE AN AGREEMENT. AT THAT THE COURSE WORK SHOULD INCLUDE IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDENTIALING- BUT ALSO INCLUDE- OF COURSE AND ETHNICS. SO IN. IT WOULD BE CERTIFICATE HE WELL BUT THERE'S NO. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SUBJECT MATTER. DR HIM YEAH I AGREE ALSO- THE OTHER THING I THINK WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE IS A SOMETHING WORSE TRANSACTION SOMEONE JUST CHECK A BOX THIS ISN'T EVENT. A SAYS THAT WILL BOB OVERTIME- I AGREE I THINK IT COULD BE- MAYBE AN ADDED AUTHORIZATION TO PRUDENT WELL AS YOU GO BACK IN. VOGUE AND RETRAIN ITSELF. SOME OF THE BAD THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN CONFRONTING FIVE- SO THEY CAN TO PROFESSIONAL- AS WE'RE AS WE'RE BUILDING AND- THIS NEW THIS. PLACE CB. THIS PRUDENTIAL- WITH THE BUCKET OF COURSE IS ARE COMBINATION OF PRACTICAL MAKES- YOU KNOW ACTION THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY I MEAN THIS IS REALLY WHERE I THINK YOU KNOW POLICY AND ACTIVISM REALLY COMES TOGETHER SO THERE'S SOME CREATIVE THINGS WE COULD DO WITH THE PEDAGOGY AND TRY. ON THIS WORK TO. TEACHER I KNOW THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO DO IT BUT WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THE SPACE BUT YOU KNOW ALSO THE RESOURCES TO DO IT RIGHT NOW WELL SO THAT THEY DON'T FEEL SOME OF THE- PRESSURE I KNOW WE YOU KNOW THE SAME- DOES. IT ALSO CREATE AND I THINK THAT'S THIS- THAT WE HAVE WOULD- YOU KNOW AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES COME ON THE SCENE OF THIS WORK INVOLVING AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE OUR OUR PROGRAM OR NOT WORKING FOR I THINK IN OF FULL DENTURE WILL TO BE OUT HERE ARE WE REALIZE THAT IS GREAT IMPORTANT. YES I'M IN. THANKS DAVE. YES IS JIM AS BIG A BETTER AT THE WAY WE DO IN THE% AT PROGRAMS- MANY OF THEM ARE DESIGNING PROGRAM SIMILAR TO WHAT AN AUTHOR. LIKE OR WHAT A CERTIFICATE WOULD LOOK LIKE SO WE'LL BE DOING THAT- RGARDLESS AND IF THERE IS A CREDENTIAL THAT IS ALFA WILL BE PART TO ISSUE. SAN WORK ON WE WILL HAVE PLACE FOR THEM- CHIU PER THERE THIRTEEN CRAFT IN OUR- WITH FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR GABER. YEAH I THINK YOU MISTER TURNER I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION OF DOCTOR HELP- THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE BEEN VERY- EACH OF THE PERSPECTIVE THAT AT ALL. ZERO SHOW- BY THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THIS IS. LOVE AND JOY AND JUSTICE AND HUMANITY AND EMPATHY COMPASSION AND I. MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN HUMANITY AND EMPATHY COMPASSION ONE OF THE REASONS I'VE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES IS BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS THE POWER TO- JUST FOR. REVERSED BACK TO CVS HEALTH. IF IT'S THERE BUTTO OPEN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF STUDENTS OF EVERY BACKGROUND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE I THINK YOU ON TRUSTED THAT SOME OTHER PREP IS- FOR TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES THAT ARE MAYBE A BIT MORE NEGATIVE HOW. BASS TO GET. OR FORTY HISTORY WITH OF ITS AND ALL OF ITS CHALLENGES AND ALL OF ITS PAIN WERE BEING HONEST ABOUT THAT BUT WERE ULTIMATELY GET IT READY AND COMPASSION. YOU KNOW. WORK FOR QUESTION. A ROBAR COMMITTEE MEMBER GABRIEL- I THINK IT'S- YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT TEACHERS ARE HUMAN TOO I THINK THE BEST WAY TO TEACH IT IS TO MODEL FOR OUR ABILITY BUT ALSO VALIDATION BY I'M SOMETIMES NOT OKAY IT'S OKAY NOT BEING OKAY. RIGHT SOMETIMES YOU'RE JUST THE POSSIBILITY CARE OF LEARNING BECAUSE YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWER. THANK THERE ARE SOME GREAT DEALS OUT THERE WHERE YOU KNOW TEACHERS ARE GRAPPLING WITH IT RIGHT I THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM OTHER PLACES THAT HAD KIND OF A YOU KNOW. A MORAL AWAKENING SO TO SPEAK BUT REALLY IT'S BEING IT OUT OF THAT PHONE ABILITY BUT ALSO YOU KNOW. HOW THEY CAN I CAN. I SEE YOU I UNDERSTAND HOW TO BUILD THIS ISN'T SOME CONTENT DOES. PARTS. RIGHT WHEN YOU HEAR SO OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE TO PEOPLE IN THE PAST BUT I THINK THE HOPEFUL PART IS WE'RE- WE KEEP. MOVING TOWARDS THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I THINK TEACHERS UNDERSTAND THAT IT REALLY ISN'T A CAREER IT'S A CALLING LIKE I ALWAYS SAY THAT I WOULD LOVED INTO THE LIFE THAT I HAVE. FIRST DIDN'T ONLY BECAUSE LET'S GET YOUR HOMEWORK DONE SO YOU CAN GET A SCHOLARSHIP AND GET TO COLLEGE SO THEY WERE MODELING THAT EMPATHY THAT COMPASSION FOR ME AS A HUMAN FOR AND THEN I WAS DIDN'T SECOND. I THINK PIECES UP THE PEDAGOGY TO TEACH CERTAIN THINGS THERE'S YOU KNOW GREAT CALLER YES AND IN THE TALKS ABOUT THE REALITY PEDAGOGY ARE YOU NOT BELL TALKS ABOUT. THE ARTS JUST GIVE IT UP BROWN'S TOPICS CULTURALLY SUSTAINED FROM GLORIA LADSON BILLINGS AND ENTANGLE PAIRS THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO REALLY INSTILL THOSE VALUES TO- ARE EDUCATE BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A COMMITMENT AND WE KNOW THAT PREPARATION- IT'S A COLLEGE AS YOU KNOW I'M STEP OR I DID TEACH THAT THAT'S THAT COULD SELF REFLECTION I HOPE I AND YOUR QUEST I REALLY THE PAR IT. THE STUFF LEARNING BECAUSE MY YOU TO OUR- BEHAVING CAN. I MEAN YOU'LL GO TO THE MOON SO TO SPEAK RIGHT SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. AND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR. S. OKAY- NOT JUST- MAKE A COMMENT- NOT NECESSARILY DIRECT ANY PARTICULAR PERSON BUT THE MAY BE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. OUR DEPARTMENT OF WAS IF CATION- WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE CREDENTIALING. CREDENTIALED TO TEACH HER TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES SO- THERE COULD BE SEVERAL AVENUES. BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY WE MAY HAVE- ORDERS CERTIFIED WALK CREDENTIALED TEACHERS SET TO A TEACHER ANY PARTICULAR TOPIC. OF ALL ETHNIC STUDIES SUCH AS- CONCENTRIC JOHN ON BLACK STUDIES TO EXPAND NEXT THIRTY SO. OR AS I MENTIONED NOT ASIAN STUDIES BUT THE- COREY IN A STEADY SOLID JAPANESE STUDIES SO WHICHEVER- I'VE BEEN TEACHING ENGLISH OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHICH INCLUDING. NEW WESTERN. FOR THE UC IRVINE CAMPUS SET FOR TIME- BUT THE I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE HIGH AT THE BY- HIGH SCHOOL. WHICH BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A- HE TOOK A DANGEROUS A SECONDARY SCHOOL CREDENTIALS AND THAT THEY ARE VERY STRICT ABOUT THAT. SO HE- SOMETHING TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM FOR ETHNIC STUDIES SELF OR PARTICULAR SECTORS PARTICULAR STUDY. IF THEY GET THE CREDENTIALS IN THAT TOPIC IN THE SUBJECT THIS TIME. BUT THE IF. ENGLISH TEACHER AT A HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN I AM HAPPENED TO BE A KOREAN AMERICAN AND THAT I KNOW WE ENCOURAGE AND THE MARKET HISTORY. AND THE PAID A LOT OF PAIN AND UPDATE BIT OVERWHELMED READING I THINK I CAN BE A GOOD- NEXT THIRTY SIX IN KOREA. KERCHER US BUT IT COULD BE A SECONDARY LEVEL CERTIFICATION PROGRAM MAYBE. AND THE THIRD WAY IT'D BE- SO IN OTHER WORDS SO THE EXISTING TEACHER CAN BE ENCOURAGED TO ADD AN ADULT STYLE PROJECT. IN ETHNIC STUDIES. AND ASSISTANT TEACHERS ALREADY ITCHING THAT THE CHECK CAN BE ALLOWED TO TEACH. AND THIRTY E. R. IF AND WHEN- NO CREDENTIAL TEACHER OR TEACHER ON STAFF ALREADY QUALIFIED TO TEACH THEN BASED UPON. THE RESUME EVALUATION IF THE PERSON HAS HAD THE FOR EXAMPLE OR- OF KOREAN STUDIES CENTERS AT THE UNIVERSITY SELLECCA UC RIVERSIDE DR EDWARD CHANG IS EXPOSED IN KOREAN THIS IS HOWEVER I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE ALLOWED TO TEACH AT THE HIGH SCHOOL. BUT THE BASIC THEN TEXAS BATTICALOA HERE TO TEACH ONE ONE NEAR AT HIS HIGH SCHOOL. THE BASED UPON HIS BED BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT ORDERLY- PRINCE SPORE CAN MAKE AN EXAMPLE FOR AND A TEMPORARY- HIRING FOR THAT YEAR NOT AS A PERMANENT TEACHER BUT THE YEAR TO YEAR EVALUATING UNTIL THAT THERE'S FIVE COMES AROUND CONVENTIONS COMES AROUND SO I THINK IN IN ME SUCH OF FINDING. REALLY THAT TEACHERS. I DON'T ETHNIC THE STUDY GROUP SO I THINK A COMBI OF ALL OF THE IS CELL- AVENUES AND OF. BECOME FLEXIBLE I THINK THAT MAY HELP THE SHORTAGE OF A QUALIFIED TEACHERS. THANK YOU DR CHOI AND- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT- I HAD DR CHANG- SPEAKING AT AT RIVERSIDE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS HE GAVE. BUT A LOT OF THE CAN AND WITH THE OTHER OF THE OF USE YOU RESIDE ON BUT AT LEAST IT LOOKED LIKE. BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT WAITING ARE NOT WAITING FOR THE CERTIFICATE FOR THE CREDENTIAL TO COME. THE I HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- THOSE INSTITUTIONS TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TAKING THE LEADERSHIP- TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMS- ACADEMIC PROGRAMS FOR TEACHERS. AND I'M REMINDED AND I THINK WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT BEFORE IT WE STARTED THE SESSION A WHEN I CAME OUT AS A TEACHER IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES- SOON AFTER THE ALLOW DECISION. WHEN BILINGUE IT. WOMEN IN. OF UC RIVERSIDE A SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AS A AS A TEACHER. WITH A CONCENTRATION IN BILINGUAL BICULTURAL- TEACHING. AND I WENT INTO A BILINGUAL CLASSROOM OF FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADE WHERE I TAUGHT SPANISH I TAUGHT READING. IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH I TAUGHT MATH IN SPANISH AND READING. AND THAT WAS BECAUSE I HAD THIS CONCENTRATION- FROM UC RIVERSIDE CERTIFICATE. THAT UC RIVERSIDE DEVELOPED. FAST FORWARD SOME THIRTY YEARS LATER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SEEM TO CATCH UP BUT IT TOOK THIRTY YEARS. BECAUSE THIRTY YEARS LATER I WAS AT THE END OF MY TEACHING CAREER STATE OF CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTED FOR CREDENTIALING. IN CLAD IN B. CLASS AND HERE I WAS NOW A TEACHER HAD NOT TAUGHT FOR THIRTY YEARS AND WAS. WIRED TO TAKE CLASSES IN THE SAME THING THAT I HAD TAKEN SOME THIRTY YEARS EARLIER AS A STUDENT TEACHER AT UC RIVERSIDE SO IF THE FOLKS FROM THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING ARE LISTENING. I HOPE THAT IT WON'T TAKE THIRTY YEARS BECAUSE THE INSTITUTIONS OF CALIFORNIA OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE TAKING THE INITIATIVE AND DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING BUT I HOPE THAT WE WILL SEE. NOT THIRTY YEARS BEFORE. THE AND OTHERS A CREDENTIAL OR A PROGRAM OF PUT IN PLACE- FOR DEFINING WHO SHOULD BE TEACHING AND WHAT SHOULD BE NEEDED AND WHAT THE QUALIFICATIONS AND THE COMPETENCY. DO YOU. LEARN WHAT ARE THE COMPETENCIES THAT TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES. WITH THAT I THANK THIS PANEL VERY MUCH AND- THAT WILL BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL. THANK YOU. SO WITH THIS NOW WILL BE DR LOUIS RODRIGUEZ UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE INTERIM DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AT UC RIVERSIDE. DR MARGARITA BET THAT ARBELA SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION. DR TESTAMENT BOLOGNA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE PROFESSOR CHICANO CHICANA STUDIES PROGRAM AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE. AND A MEMBER AND LEADER OF THE CSU ETHNIC STUDIES COUNCIL. SO WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN OF THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AT UC RIVERSIDE DR LEWIN RODRIGUEZ HOPEFULLY YOU'RE THERE DR RODRIGUEZ YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WHAT IS LOUIS RODRIGUEZ I AM THE INTERIM DEAN A PROFESSOR IN THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT THE ROLE THAT THE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION PLAYED IN PREPARE AT SPEECH. BYPASS OF AB ONE FUND MAKING IT THE- OF. REQUIREMENT. 292-920-2920 THIRTY. I LIKE TO GIVE A VERY. WHO IN THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. TRIED RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF HIGHLY SKILLED IN COMMUNITY RATHERTHAN TEACHERS CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR OVERALL MISSION AT THE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL EDUCATE AND TEACHER PROGRAM CIVIC. AS THE ALL UNITS OF THE CAP INLAND EMPIRE REGION IT IS VITAL THAT WE PRODUCE TEACHERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO SERVING OUR REGION THAT MISSION FOR A LITTLE BACKGROUND TWO YEARS BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF AB ONE A ONE. UCR'S OF IT CAME IN AT SIX THIRTY IS AN OPPORTUNIST AS PART OF OUR CURRENT TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM. THE IDEA WAS. OUR REGULAR BIRD OF TEACHER EDUCATION CANDIDATES AND UPON MATRICULATION STUDENTS IN ANY PROGRAM COULD APPLY TO BECOME PART OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES EMPHASIS. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ACADEMIC YEAR WE PILOTED I THINK STUDIES EMPHASIS PROGRAM. ALL TEACHER EDUCATION STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE FROM ANY SUBJECT AREA AND ACROSS MULTIPLE SUBJECT FOR SUBJECTS STUDENTS. IN THIS PRIVATE BEER TWENTY FIVE OUR STUDENTS EXPRESSED INTEREST. OVER THE NEXT YEARS. THIRTY ONCE EXPRESSED INTEREST AT THE EMPHASIS. STUDENTS AMERICAN STUDIES EMPHASIS TAKE THREE ADDITIONAL COURSES FOCUSED ON K. TWELVE I THINK STUDIES. CRITICAL PEDAGOGY PEDAGOGIES OF RACIAL JUSTICE AND NEXT YEAR A CLUSTERED SECTION WITHIN THE PROGRAM CAPSTONE COURSE WHERE STUDENTS WERE IN EFFECT STUDIES PARKWAY WILL JOIN A COHORT OF STUDENTS PURSUING THAT NEXT TEMPERATURES. OF COURSE STUDENTS AND THE STUDY'S EMPHASIS ALSO RECEIVE ACCESS TO A SPEAKERS RESERVE EXPERT TO FOCUS ON ETHNIC STUDIES IN UNIVERSITIES AND OR SCHOOL DO. WHAT UP TO SIX CORES AND TWENTY AND OTHER RELATED TOPICS WHICH ALL SERVICE PROFESSION UP. FORCED DURING THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ACADEMIC YEAR WE CREATED THE ETHNIC STUDIES PATHWAY. THIS APPROACH WAS SLIGHTLY ENHANCED BY PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH ALL OF THE PROGRAMMATIC OPPONENTS I MENTIONED ABOVE PLUS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ALONGSIDE A DISTRICT COOPERATING TEACHER WHO TEACHES WITH AN ETHNIC STUDIES LANDS. EVEN OUR EFFORTS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE HAD FIFTY NINE YOU SEE OUR TEACHER EDUCATION CANDIDATES TAKING THE EMPHASIS OR PATH WE ROUTE. THIS MEANS THAT FIFTY NINE FUTURE TEACHERS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE WORK CONTEXT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE HISTORY PEDAGOGY RESEARCH AND IMPACT THAT ETHNIC STUDIES HAS ON STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY INDICATED TWELVE SYSTEM. SECOND COMPONENT OF UCR'S WORK IS TO USE YOUR EXTENSION. I A LONGTIME ALONGSIDE SOME OF MY SCHOOL OF EDUCATION COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH YOU SEE OUR EXTENSION TO CREATE A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM FOR IN SERVICE TEACHERS. ARE COLLEAGUES IN UCR EXTENSION HAVE LED THE WAY BY SERVING IN SERVICE TEACHERS THROUGH ONLINE ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE WORK. THIS PROGRAM IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND ACROSS THE STATE AND IS ACCESSIBLE TO IN SERVICE TEACHERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO IN SERVICE TEACHERS EXTENSION PROGRAM CERTIFICATE ALSO SERVES ADMINISTRATORS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THIS CERTIFICATE WAS LAUNCHED LATE IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND TO DATE TWENTY SIX IN SERVICE TEACHERS HAVE RECEIVED AN ETHNIC STUDIES CERTIFICATE. THIS PROGRAM IS EXCITING BECAUSE IT GREW OUT OF A WORKING PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT USE YOUR EXTENSION. USE YOUR MEDICATION. I LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A PATH WE- STRUCTURE IN THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION THAT WE'VE CREATED. AS WE THINK ABOUT DEVELOPING FUTURE EDUCATION TEACHERS IT IS VITAL FUTURE ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS IT IS VITAL THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING VARIOUS PATHWAYS INTO THE TEACHING WORKFORCE IN AREAS LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR IDENTIFYING FUTURE TEACHERS EARLY. DEVELOPING MECHANISMS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS ENSURING THAT THEY REMAIN BABY COMMITTEE. GEN UP. FOR WHAT THESE REASONS UCR SCHOOL OF EDUCATION HAS DEVELOPED A PATHWAY PROGRAM THAT IS POISED TO SERVE AS A VEHICLE TO THE TOP IN THE REGION AMID. OTHERS ARE THE REGION AND THIS CALIFORNIA. THIS PROGRAM IS CALLED THE FIERCE SCHOLARS PROGRAM IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION LAUNCHED THIS BEER SCHOLARS PROGRAM IN ADMITTED ITS FIRST COHORT OF TWELVE STUDENTS. HERE STANDS FOR. AMP REGION EDUCATORS THIS IS A GROW YOUR OWN TYPE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES A MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT FROM THE SKY UCR SCHOOL OF EDUCATION TO STUDENTS IN THE EDUCATION MAJOR STUDENTS WILL BECOME FIERCE. WILL RECEIVE SCHOLARSHIP SCHOLARSHIPS PROVIDE MENTORSHIP CURRICULUM PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ACCORDING SPIRITS. YOUR SCHOLARS ARE ADMITTED DURING THEIR JUNIOR YEAR S. CURRENT YARN IT'S OR INCOMING TRANSFER STUDENTS. YOUR SCHOLARS RECEIVE SUPPORT FIRST YEAR IN THEIR MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAM IN THE UCR SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AS WELL SO THIS IS A THREE YEAR COMMITMENT. THE GOAL IS FOR THE PLAYERS TO EARN A MASTER'S DEGREE IN THE TEACHER EDUCATION. TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM. OR OTHER SCHOOL OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS. SCHOLARS MUST COMMIT TO SERVING THE INLAND EMPIRE FOR FOUR YEARS FOR FOUR YEARS UPON GRADUATE ENTERING THE WORKFORCE. WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM WILL BE UPON THE WORK IT HAS ALREADY BEEN HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION TO DRIP PROGRAM HERE AT U. C. R. AND SERVE AS A VEHICLE TO AMPLIFY THE TEACHER WORKFORCE AND THE F. WORK. FUTURE THIS IS ONE TAP IN THE UC SCHOOL OF. THAT IS INTENSE BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES TO RECRUIT. RETAIN AND DEVELOP THE FUTURE WORKFORCE AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SPECIFICALLY FUEL THE ETHNIC STUDIES. TEACHER WORKFORCE FOR THE REGION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN CONCLUSION YOU SEE I WAS ABLE TO GET A HEAD START. ON THE PROGRAMMING REQUIRED TO DEVELOP FUTURE ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS. DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF POSSIBLE FUTURE REQUIREMENTS. CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A WE HAVE CREATED A FOUNDATION TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WORK MUST INVOLVE COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BILLION OPERATE THESE WITHOUT TO SEE CAMPUSES AND CALL ACROSS EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. DR RODRIGUEZ. AFTER MONEY I NEED TO VENT THAT OBVIOUS. IF YOU WHEN I BEGIN WELCOME THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JOSE MEDINA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I SHARED MY NAME IS MIKE I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT A LOT A PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION- AT SACRAMENTO STATE AND I PLAY FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE LOOKING TO RECEIVE SCHOOL CREDENTIALS AND- RIGHT OFFICER WITH THE CAN BRING IT BACK ASSOCIATION. AND I WANT TO DOT. MILLER I MEMBER ME AS DIAZ. AND AS A CHICANO CHICANA STUDIES MADE- I WAS NOT INFORMED AT ALL ABOUT MY HISTORY- WHERE I CAME FROM OR OR HOW I WAS GROUNDED IN THE COPY. OF AND THE CHICANO CHICANA STUDIES CLASS WITH DR I HAD A SOCIETY THAT THAT- IT WAS AN OPENING OF REVELATION- ALMOST A METAMORPHOSIS OF HOW I SAW MYSELF HOW I VIEW MYSELF AND IT WAS. WHICH GOT ME. I MAY THE VERY INTENSE TO SEE TO BE A TEACHER IN ORDER TO REALLY OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO WHAT I HAD RECEIVED IN EDUCATION SO I FRAME MY TALK TODAY A LITTLE BIT- IN THAT CONTEXT ALSO IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT I'M ON GROUND WHAT THE TEACHERS THAT- AND PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS THAT I'M WORKING WITH. SO IN THAT SEVERAL MANY OF US HAVE WITNESSED AN ORGANIZED THE RIGHTEOUS SURGE IN HOLDING DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR STUDENTS AND IMPLEMENTING ETHNIC STUDIES AS A HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS. AT THE STATE LEVEL THOSE SAME TO HAVE MANIFESTED WITH AB ONE OH ONE. AND NOW LEGISLATION EXISTS THAT SOLIDIFIES THE RITICAL IMPORTANCE OF ALL STUDENTS TAKING ETHNIC STUDIES HOWEVER A MAJOR QUESTION STILL EXISTS WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ANSWER IT SHOULD BE ALL AFTERNOON. COOL TEACH AT THIRTY INSERVICE TEACHERS TO TEACH EXPERTISE AND HOW WILL THEY BE PREPARED. AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAMS ARE THE TEACHERS TO THIS POINT CHRISTINE LEADER STATES AND I QUOTE I THINK THESE TEACHERS MUST BE ABLE TO RELATE WELL WITH THEIR STUDENTS. BUT EVEN IF IN FACT MAKE ABILITY. WHAT'S NEXT THAT IS CONTENT AND PERSPECTIVE WELL HAPPENS. SOMETIMES THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE SAME ETHNIC BACKGROUND OF MOST OF THEIR STUDENTS CURRENTLY IN MOST PLACES THE OPPOSITE OCCURS. ONE NEED ONLY HAVE AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. A SOCIAL SCIENCE CREDENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES IN ORDER TO SEAL THE SAME RESULT REPORTED IN THEATERS RESEARCH NOTED ABOVE FUTURE I THINK THE TEACHERS NEED CRITICAL COULD TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS THAT IS WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH STRONG UNDERGRADUATE ETHNIC STUDIES. JEAN CAMMACK MINIMUM WORKING PAN AFRICAN OR APPEAR MAJORS AND IN SERVICE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND OR DEVELOP CERTIFICATES ALSO IN COLLABORATION. THIS SHOULD NOT BE AN EITHER OR BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE FOR THESE TWO ENTITIES TO WORK TOGETHER BASED ON THE EXPERTISE OF CONTENT. TO GO G. AND METHODOLOGY. AS JUST EARLIER INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT WAITING RIGHT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND YOU'LL ALSO HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUE DR THAT IS SOMEONE DANIEL. THE COMMISSION CANNOT EITHER. AND I SAY THIS WITH THE EXAMPLE THAT I'M ABOUT TO SHARE RIGHT NOW IN THE POSITION THAT I CURRENTLY HOLD NOT ONLY IS THE PROFESSOR BUT ALSO AS SERVING AS A LIAISON BETWEEN ETHNIC STUDIES AND ARE STILL SUBJECT CREDENTIAL AS AN ADVISER. I TO REALLY COME TO IN A PROFOUND WAY. AS I SHARE THAN CURRENT ADVISING ETHNIC STUDENTS AT SACRAMENTO STATE THAT WANT TO BE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS AND TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT ETHNIC STUDIES IS. THE PLAN IN AND OF ITSELF. AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY POINTS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER AND CONTINUE TO ONE PACK. BECAUSE THERE IS NO ETHNIC STUDIES CREDENTIAL WHICH IS WHAT I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE IN ADDITION TO OTHER ALTERNATIVES ARE UNDERGRADUATE ETHNIC STUDIES MAJORS CURRENTLY THAT HAVE NOT YET ENTERED PREVENTION PROGRAM THE PRE SERVICE TEACHER BUT WILL TO BE TEACHER. FROM MY- HI WILL THE WORK. AS ALREADY MENTIONED THAT CURRENTLY TEACH OR WANT TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES MUST HAVE A SOCIAL SCIENCE CREDENTIAL BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY HAVE ANY BACKGROUND IN THE DISCIPLINE. SB STUDIES MAJORS UNDERGRADUATES FOR THE MOST PART WHY COULDN'T FIND IT WITH THE FACT THAT THEIR MAJOR EVEN THOUGH IT IS I THINK STUDIES WILL STILL NOW ALLOW THEM WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO TEACH. ETHNIC STUDIES. AND MAKE DECISION THE ULTIMATELY FORCES THEM TO REDUCE THEIR CONTENT AREA TO ANOTHER AND OTHER AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN. THEY HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO DECIDE. MY MANAGEMENT- BUT THEN ENSURE THAT THEY ARE TAKING ALL THE COURSES NECESSARY OUTSIDE OF THEIR FIELD IN THIS CONTEXT SOCIAL SCIENCE TO MEET SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCY IN SOCIAL SCIENCE WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH ETHNIC STUDIES FACULTY QUITE CLOSELY TO DETERMINE WHICH ARE THOSE APPROPRIATE COURSES VIA THE PROPAGATION OF MEANS OF ETHNIC STUDIES WE SAID SHE- ARE. VIA THE SEAT AND THE MADE IT MAY SUCH AS ENGLISH MATH TO NAME A FEW CAN DEMONSTRATE SUBJECT MATTER COMPENSATE JUST BE OTHER MAJOR BUT THIRTY. NOT THIS IS THE CASE FOR ETHNIC STUDIES AS OF NOW IT HAS TO BE COMPLETED THROUGH SOCIAL SCIENCE WHICH CAN ADD TIME TO GRADUATION ESPECIALLY IF NOT ADVISED EARLY ENOUGH WHICH IS WHERE MY ROLE COMES IN RIGHT NOW I'M NOT TRYING TO GET THEM. EVEN BEFORE THEY TRANSFER SACRAMENTO STATE OR WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY FIRST YEAR STUDENTS IN WHICH ETHNIC STUDIES MAJORS WOULD THEN IF NOT ADVISED EARLY ENOUGH WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE C. SETS. WHICH IS SUBJECT MATTER DEMONSTRATE SUBJECT MATTER WHICH CAN BE COSTLY. AS WELL OF NO RELEVANCE TO THEIR DISCIPLINE AS ETHNIC STUDIES MAJORS. SO IF THEY DETERMINE THAT IT WANTS A MAJOR ANYTHING MAJOR REALIZES THAT THEIR MAJOR DOESN'T COUNT. KATE DO THEY THEN THAT'S WHAT I DO SHARE JUST ONE ROUTE ANOTHER ROUTE IS MAINTAINED A MAJOR BUT DOUBLE MAJOR SOCIAL SITES. OR DECIDE TO NO LONGER MAJOR DNEVNIK STUDIES MAJOR IN SOCIAL SCIENCE AND POSSIBLY MINOR IN ETHNIC STUDIES- SOMETHING IMPORTANT T NOTE. WHICH ARE DR MANTAN YOU'LL SHARE A LOT MORE ABOUT IS HOW POWERFUL IT IS WHEN STUDENTS CAN WORK ON THE ETHNIC STATUS MAJOR AND ALSO HAVE AN EMPHASIS CONCENTRATION IN EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS AT SACRAMENTO STATE WHO WANTS TO BE BILINGUAL EDUCATION TEACHERS OR TEACHING- BUT SETTINGS CAN HAVE SUCH A CONCENTRATION WITH COURSES FOR EXAMPLE THE ADOPTION TO BILINGUAL ED POLICY PRINCIPLE SIX BUT- S. NEXT. YEAR'S THAT THE CONCERT. GOING IN. OUR TEACHER AGE. A COLLABORATION THAT FORGED BETWEEN TEACHING CREDENTIALS AND ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT MOREOVER AN INTENTIONAL COLLABORATION OF ADVISING BETWEEN THE TWO DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS AS SUCH I CURRENTLY SERVE AS A SHARED AS THE LIAISON ADVISOR ESPECIALLY FOR THE STUDENTS INTERESTED IN TEACHING IS CRITICAL AND I HAVE FOUND IT CRITICAL TO KEEP MY COLLEAGUES IN ETHNIC STUDIES APPRISED OF CHANGES LEGISLATION EXCEPTION WHICH COULD IMPACT TRAJECTORIES BUT DEFINITELY CALLS FOR JOINT WORK. WHAT I DO SURE RIGHT NOW IS ALL BEFORE THEY EVEN ENTER THE CREDENTIALING PROGRAM POINTS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER. INCREASE SERVICE ULTIMATELY FOR PRE SERVICE CANDIDATES A STRONG UNDERGRADUATE ETHNICS MID THIRTIES MAJOR WITH THE pIS CRITICAL. AND THEN THE ANSWER FIFTY YEAR PROGRAM. ARE TEACHING CREDENTIALS IN WHICH ALL AFFINITY CONCENTRATIONS WOULD MERGE VIA AND ALL YOUR METHODS PEDAGOGY COURSES AND OTHER COURSES. FEEL PLACEMENT IS CRUCIAL. THE SCHOOL THE TEACHER THEIR BACKGROUND AND HAVING BACKGROUND IN ETHNIC STUDIES. IF THERE'S CONSIDERATION OF AUTHORIZATIONS OR INTRODUCTORY SUBJECT MATTER AUTHORIZATIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO STILL REMEMBER THAT IT'S STILL PUTS THE STUDENT SERVICE TEACHER IN A POSITION OF STILL HAVING TO HAVE A SOCIAL SCIENCE COULD ENSURE. AND THEN HAVE THE AUTHORIZATION TOP OF THEIR CREDENTIALS SO AGAIN PUTTING INTO EFFECT OF THE TIME. NOW AT THE SAME TIME LET'S SAY AN ETHNIC STUDIES CREDENTIAL COMES TO FRUITION AND YOU HAVE STUDENTS THEIR SOCIAL SCIENCE TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANNONS OR OTHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES. THEN THURSDAY SHE COULD BE VIABLE AND VERY POWERFUL WITH THE CRITERIA THAT DOCTOR MONTH ON YOUR WILL OUTLINE. AND QUICKLY. IN SERVICE TEACHERS MANY STUDENT TEACHERS THAT INTO THE FIELD INTERESTED IN TEACHING I THINK STUDIES IF THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE SOCIAL PROTEST SIGNS CREDENTIAL THERE DISTRICTS ARE WORKING WITH LOCAL UNIVERSITIES ENTITIES ORGANIZATIONS I THINK WE'VE HEARD A MARAT OF EXAMPLES ALREADY OF THE TYPE OF COLLABORATIONS- THAT ARE HAPPENING VIA CERTIFICATIONS OR THAT COULD BE IT COULD HAPPEN. MISTER TYPICALLY- DESERTIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR- TEACHERS WORKING WITH- THE THOMAS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY WITH FOURTH FIFTH EIGHTH AND NINTH GRADERS- LOOKING AT THE EXPERIENCES THERE FROM GROUNDED IN ETHNIC STUDIES AND THIS ALSO INCLUDES ETHNIC STUDIES PROFESSORS SO AT THIRTIES PROGRAMS- PARTY CRITICAL AND THE COLLABORATION IS NECESSARY BETWEEN ETHNIC STUDIES AND TEACH CHRISTIAN PROGRAM. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ONCE THE PANELS COMPLETED. THANK YOU NOW WILL GO TO THE THIRD PALACE THAT AS A ONE THANK YOU. FOR SAW- THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS VERY IMPORTANT PANEL TODAY- AS MY TO GET IT THE SAID I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HEARD TODAY THAT. A STATE FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU MY CALL WAS INTO TO CATIA. FOR OF THEM TRYING TO. WITHIN THE YEAR PRO. FIX THE DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE- AND THAT IS THE OF QUALIFIED ETHNIC STUDIES OF TEACHERS UP AND THE CARD. DEVELOPING SOME WONDERFUL PROGRAMS TO PLAY CATCH UP. LET ME JUST SAY YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY OF THE BILL AS WELL A TEACHER AT KATE. WITHIN. OR I COULD TEACH AND SHE GONNA STUDIES. AND THE AND I CHOSE TO GO ON A STUDIES- MAINLY BECAUSE RUDY OF KONYA MANY OF YOU KNOW. OFTEN REMINDED US THAT TO KIND OF CITIES FACULTY. IT IS OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE FUTURE TEACHERS. IN OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND UNDERSTAND OUR OUR STUDENTS. UP THE FOUNDING THAT YOU GOT IS THAT EASY OFTEN SAID. COINCIDED WITH THE CALL FOR BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND SO WE ARE NOT NEW TO TEACHER PREPARATION AND I COULD SAY THE SAME ABOUT MY SIMPLY IN A DEPARTMENT OF AN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER STUDIES AFRICANA STUDIES AMERICAN INDIAN STUDIES WE ALL WE- BEEN- INTERESTING TO ME UNLESS TO THE- TODAY YES WHAT A DISK CAN THAT EXISTS BETWEEN COLLEGES OF EDUCATION. OUR STATE SYSTEMS UNDER ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT ALL WHICH SHOULD BE WORKING JOINTLY IN THE PREPARATION OF ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS. WE FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE MONEY THE FIRST TO GET PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS IN ETHNIC STUDIES AND HISTORY AND LANGUAGE AND CULTURE ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INITIATED PROGRAMS LIKE OPERATION SHE GOT A TEACHER AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE. THE BLACK TECH ON FRIDAY GRAHAM POSTED LA THE MEXICAN AMERICAN EDUCATION PROJECT AT SAC STATE THE FILIPINO EDUCATION PROGRAM AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE WHERE WE IN ETHNIC STUDIES PROVIDED INTERNSHIPS TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS GAVE PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS EXPERIENCES IN CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT. PROVIDED MONETARY STIPENDS AND EARLY FILLED. IN SCHOOLS AND INCOME WORKING WITH PARENTS. THESE PROGRAMS WERE OFTEN SUPPORTED BY SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING OR BY GRANTS AND ALL OF THEM UNFORTUNATELY EVENTUALLY SAW THEIR DEMISE BUT THE DESIRE AND THE DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE OUR FUTURE TEACHERS TO TEACH THE CONTENT THE PISTA MALIK G. THE LINGUISTIC REPERTOIRE THE INTELLECTUAL TRADITIONS THE ART AND CULTURE THE. PEDIG PRACTICES IN ETHNICS THE AS A CO AREA REMAINED INTACT UNTIL I ABSOLUTELY STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT EVERY SINGLE DISCIPLINE AND EVERY SINGLE MAJOR SHOULD INFUSE EQUITY AND DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION PRINCIPLES IN THEIR MAJOR THAT EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM DEPARTMENT AND- OFFICE WITHIN A SEAT WHEN YOU SEE SHOULD EXEMPLIFIED JUSTICE AND EQUITY AND DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THEIR OPERATION AND FUNCTIONS. THAT IS NOT ETHNIC STUDIES ETHNIC STUDIES IS VERY DIFFERENT. AND AT THE PRESENT TIME ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENTS CONTINUED TO OFFER PROGRAMS IN TEACHER PREPARATION VERY FEW OF WHICH WERE NAMED TODAY. SAN FRANCISCO STATE CAL STATE LA AND SEE SON DO IT THROUGH PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE STATE STANDARDS FOR THE TEACHING PROFESSION SO THERE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING THIS BUDGET MATTER PROGRAMS THAT MUCH THAT THE MULTITUDE THAT TALKED ABOUT. IT WAS STUDENT FOUR THREE MAJORS INTO KIND OF STUDIES WITH THE SINGLE SUBJECT MATTER MAJOR THEN THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE ALLOWED TO GO INTO IT DID YOU SING PROGRAM WITHOUT A SEIZE THAT THE SAME APPLIES FOR THE ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAM. AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE. TO AND THAT MAY BE IN QUESTION AFTER THE PAST OF THE BUDGET BILL OF AB ONE THIRTY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THEIR SINGLE SUBJECT MAJORS. LIKE TO KNOW MY- FINGERS HILLS AND EAST BAY. ARE WORKING THROUGH EXISTING LIBERAL STUDIES PROGRAMS THAT PREPARE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS SO SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU HEARD TODAY LIKE THE L. CAL STATE LA PROGRAM. IS NOT PREPARED MEANS THE TEACHERS TO TEACH HIGH SCHOOL ETHNIC STUDIES. THERE ARE ACTUALLY PREPARING TEACHERS TO TEACH ELEMENTARY ETHNIC STUDIES. WHICH IS NEAT BUT NOT IS NOT A- AB ONE OH ONE. AT THE SEVEN WE HAVE COURSES WITH IN OUR DEPARTMENT THAT MEET THE B. CLASS STANDARDS WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE TO THIRTEEN COURSES IN EDUCTION IN CHICANO STUDIES. AND MANY OF OUR STUDENTS TAKE THE CHECK ON A CHILD CLASS THE LANGUAGE ACQUISITION CLASS AND OTHERS TO MEET THE B. CLASS CERTIFICATE SO WE HAVE THE COURSE WORK. BUT YET WHEN MY STUDENTS COME INTO MY CORPUS MANY IN THEIR SENIOR YEAR THEY LET ME THE FACT THEY ARE NOT READY TO. START RIGHT ONE MY COURT AND ONE YEAR IS NOT GOING TO PREPARE THEM TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES- AND I CAN GO ON THAT LIST OTHER CAMPUSES DOING ETHNIC STUDIES WORK IN THE AREA OF TEACHER PREPARATION BUT LET ME. WITH THIS. AND IN NINETEEN AND- TWENTY. UP CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND THAT FRESNO COLLEGE OF EDUCATION CRIME AND- THROUGH BUT THEY SAID LOPEZ. CO SPONSORED A SERIES OF WEBINARS ON ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHER PATHWAY PROJECTS. PROVIDING MANY OF THE FOLKS THAT YOU HEARD THIS AFTERNOON TO PRESENT THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT T. CATION AND ETHNIC STUDIES. BUT THERE WOULD BE PREPARED WITH THE AB ONE REQUIREMENT. WE HAVE OVER A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTING K. TWELVE EDUCATORS COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR UNIVERSITY SCHOOL BOARD TRUSTEES COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND UNION ORGANIZERS THE COMPLETED SURVEYS AND PARTICIPATED IN THIS WEAPON ARE. AND HERE'S THEIR FINDINGS. CURRENT SUBJECTS ARE PROJECTS THAT EXIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONLY THREE HAVE ETHNIC STUDIES SPECIALIST IN THOSE CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS WHAT WE NEED ARE ETHNIC STUDIES SUBJCT MATTER PROJECTS TO OVERWHELMINGLY CONSENSUS FROM EXPERTS AND PARTICIPANTS THAT MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION AND ETHNIC STUDIES IS THE SAME. THREE THERE IS A STRONG FOUNDATION AND THAT'S NEXT THAT IS NON NEGOTIABLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF FUTURE TEACHERS. THERE IS SOCIAL STUDIES CREDENTIAL IS NOT ENOUGH. AND THAT ONE YEAR DOES NOT EQUAL THE OF A STRONG FOUNDATION IN ETHNIC STUDIES WE DO FEEL THAT THERE ARE THAT THERE HAS TO BE OF VERY AUTHORIZATION PROCESS. DESIGNED FOR CURRENT MAJORS AND ETHNIC STUDIES TO GET THEIR TEACHING CREDENTIAL WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO WHAT MY TO GET IT THE SAID WHICH IS THAT MEET ADDITIONAL COURSEWORK. TO A UNIVERSITY AUTHORIZATION THAT WOULD OFFER A DEGREE IN ANY OF THE DISCIPLINES OF ETHNIC STUDIES AND THEN A CREDENTIAL- A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM AND STE CURRENTLY SAN FRANCISCO STATE AND YESTERDAY THANK. NORTHRIDGE APPROVED A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM FOR PRACTICING EDUCATORS- THAT WOULD BE TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES AND THAT THAT CERTIFICATE PROGRAM HAS THREE COURSES IN THE CONTENT AREA ONE COURSE IN SPECIFIC PEDAGOGY ANDONE COURSE IN FIELD EXPERIENCE WHERE THEY WOULD- TEACHER. THE THIRD IS THE POSSIBILITY OF DISTRICT MICRO CREDENTIAL AUTHORIZATIONS WERE DISTRICTS ETHNIC STUDIES FACULTY AND COLLEGE OF EDUCATION WOULD WORK TOGETHER AND DESIGNING OF MICRO CREDENTIALS WITH AT LEAST BEING AN ETHNIC STUDIES. AND FINALLY WHAT YOU ALL CAN HELP US TO DO. IS TO REALLY HELP SUPPORT ETHNIC STUDIES PATHWAY PILOT PROJECTS SIMILAR TO THE PROJECTS THAT YOU ONCE HAD OR THAT MAYBE STILL EXIST THE CAREER LADDER OPTIONS THAT THAT THE STATE OFFERED WHERE THERE WAS FUNDING FOR PILOT PROJECTS- FOR. EDUCATORS WHO WANT TO ACHIEVE THEIR TEACHING CREDENTIAL TO OFFERS SUCH- OF A PATH WITH A PILOT PROJECT THAT WOULD REQUIRE ETHNIC STUDIES FACULTY COLLEGES OF EDUCATION DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY TO BEGIN TO THINK OF WAYS TO CREATE. A PATHWAY FOR A GROW YOUR UP AS MY COLLEAGUE- AT RIVERSIDE SAID. I THINK CITY TEACHERS ARE MAY THEY'RE NOT WORN. I THINK EDUCATORS MUST HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES CONTENT AND SUBJECT MATTER AND A STRONG GRASP OF ETHNIC STUDIES PEDAGOGY. ULTIMATELY WE ALL HAVE THE ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE DISCIPLINE OF ETHNIC STUDIES IS PROVIDED THE SAME ACADEMIC DEFERENCE AS MATH. AND SCIENCE AS ENGLISH AS OUR- IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF ETHNIC STUDIES AND TO CREATE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR ALL STUDENTS CAN ENGAGE IN CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS TAKE ACADEMIC RISKS AND LEARN TO THINK CRITICALLY WELL BECOMING MORE COMPASSIONATE. AND EMPATHETIC INDIVIDUALS COLLEGES OF EDUCATION ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENTS THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE COMMUNITY WAS JOINED TOGETHER IN A JOINT ENDEAVOR TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE- SHE OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE IMPLEMENT QUALITY ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAMS AND COURSES. THANK YOU DR MANTEGNA I'M GONNA START WITH- SHARING THE TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE CAMPUS AT A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR ONE OF MY PROFESSORS BY PROFESSOR OF- TO KIND OF POLITICS A DOCTOR MON THE NEVADA WHO WHO PASSED AWAY RECENTLY. AND WE HAVE SAID IS CHAMBER OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE'VE HEARD IT FROM STUDENTS FROM PHD STUDENTS FROM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM OUR OWN COLLEAGUES FROM MR LOW MR SANTIAGO THE POWER OF ETHNIC STUDIES. AND SO AS THE MEMORIAL FOR DOCTOR MON THE NEVADA TOOK PLACE TWO WEEKS GO AT UC RIVERSIDE THE THEATER AT UCR WAS FULL FULL OF STUDENTS. GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS. FROM FOLKS AS OLD AS MAY TWO YOUNGER FOLKS LIKE EDUARDO GARCIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND YOUNGER BUT WE ALL HAD THE SAME STORY THE SAME MESSAGE AND I WAS HERE JUST A LITTLE BIT THAT WHEN I WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND- IN MY SENIOR YEAR AT UC RIVERSIDE AND I SAT AND DOCTOR MON THEN ABOUT HIS CLASS- WHERE I.TEXTBOOK WAS OCCUPIED AMERICA. IN THE FIRST ADDITION THAT THEY STILL HAVE- THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAD ON US AS STUDENTS. AND ESPECIALLY AS LATINO CHICANO STUDENTS RIGHT IT INSPIRED THIS AND I SAID I'VE SAID DR. BOTTAS FOR THE FIRST TIME NOT ONLY FROM THE PAGES OF DOCTOR GUNAS BOOK BUT ALSO BY HIS EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW THAT WE- WERE VALUE. THAT WE HAD A HISTORY AND A CULTURE THAT WAS OF VALUE THAT HAD BEEN IGNORED BUT BUT NO LESS. IMPORTANT. AND THAT HE BELIEVED IN US AS STUDENTS AND AS AS SCHOLARS AND THEREFORE STUDENTS FROM THAT CLASS WENT ON TO BE TEACHERS LIKE MYSELF. ATTORNEYS LIKE CARLOS WHY THOSE JUDGES LIKE WHAT A HERNANDEZ. RIGHT AND SO THE IMPACT. IS UNDENIABLE RIGHT WHEN DONE RIGHT. SO HERE WE ARE THAT THE TIME THAT I WAS A STUDENT A SENIOR AT UC RIVERSIDE SITTING IN DR NEVADA'S CLASS AND WE HAVE NOW PASSED THIS LEGISLATION WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE. OR INSTITUTIONS WHO WANT TO GO AND BECOME TEACHERS AND BECAUSE CATION CAN BE TRANSFORMED WITH THIS WE SEE THE SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS OF COLOR. WE SEE TEACHERS OF COLOR DROPPING OUT OF. LEAVING THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE THEY'RE FACED WITH OBSTACLES THAT OTHER TEACHERS DON'T IT'S- SO I THINK ONE QUESTION THAT I HAVE- FOR ALL THE THREE PANELISTS HERE IS. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING AT YOUR INSTITUTIONS OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING TO BECOME TEACHERS AND- YOU KNOW HOW MANY. ARE ARE BEING ATTRACTED TO WANTING TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES WHAT ARE YOU SEEING ON YOUR CAMPUSES. WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT ARE SINGLE SUBJECT MAJOR HAS DOUBLED RIGHT IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ARE COMING INTO A PROGRAM. OF THAT THE CERTIFICATE OPTION IN- ETHNIC STUDIES THAT WAS PASSED YOU WITHOUT ONE DISSENTING VOTE AND THE ACADEMIC SENATE- FOR THE ACADEMIC COUNCIL- BECAUSE THERE WAS A STATE IT NEEDED. THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN LEAST TWENTY INQUIRIES AND JUST OVERNIGHT- FOR FOLKS WHO ARE WANTING TO ENROLL IN THAT CERTIFICATE- I WHEN I STARTED AT- CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE AND TOP THE COURSES IN ETHNIC STUDIES OF MY COURSES WERE ABOUT THIRTY STUDENTS- AT THE DICK. TEN SOME AND BUSINESS OF BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T THERE WAS NO ONE WHO WANTED TO GO INTO EDUCATION AND NOW WE OFFER FORCE THIS- AND THE CLASSES ARE PACKED- AND MORE STUDENTS TO ENROLL SO THAT I MEAN I TELL MY STUDENTS WERE ADVISED. VISIT RIGHT TO BE. I'M SURE AN ETHNIC STUDIES. OF THEIR COMING IN AT THE MERCY WAS PERFECT TIME SO THE INTERESTS IS ABSOLUTELY GOING UP. AND WHAT YOU AND DOING LOUIS DID YOU WANNA GO FIRST OR YOU WANT ME TO GO SURE I COULD JUMP IN- IT WORST TEAM IS ON AVERAGE. ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS PER COHORT. PER YEAR OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND WHAT WERE SEEN SINCE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE ETHNIC STUDIES PATHWAY AN EMPHASIS- ALMOST 20% OF THOSE STUDENTS HAVE SOME KIND OF INTEREST IN. ETHNIC STUDIES A MINUTE STUDIES- ENGINE WHAT I'M OBSERVING IT. THIS IS COMING THEY'RE COMING TO US WITH INTENTIONALITY WITH INTEREST WITH A PASSION TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK THIS IS AS MY COLLEAGUE JUST MENTIONED- WHAT WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN INTEREST AND- I THINK THIS IS NOT THE PERFECT TIME TO REALLY- WRAP UP THESE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO. SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THESE WAYS. NOT PRIVATE THANK YOU- I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL I. HAVE THE NUMBERS OF OUR CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS IN THE SUB SPECIFICALLY ARE. I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH FACULTY TO ACTUALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF- HOW MANY STUDENTS WASHY ONE COMING TO THE PROGRAM. AND SINCE WE'VE MADE BEGAN TO THE INTENTIONAL EFFORTS OF HAVING THAT LAYS ON BRIDGE BETWEEN ETHNIC STUDIES AND MYSELF AND SEE IF THERE. ARE NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED AS WELL AS FAR AS- AT THIS POINT TO STUDENTS WANTED TO BE SOCIAL SCIENCE MAJORS OR CREDENTIAL IN TO BE ABLE TO CHECK STUDIES. THAT'S POOL THERE. BECAUSE THAT INCREASED IN. IN THE IN THE- TO REALLY. FOR AN EDUCATION THAT WAS NOT GIVEN TO THAT. RIGHT NOW BUT- IS ME AND I'M GOING TO AND I THINK YOU HEARD IT AND I'M SORRY BUT WAS VERY PASSIONATE IN MY TIME BUT WE'LL WORRY ARE THE STRUCTURES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST. AT LEAST IN BUT I'M SEEN AS A MENTAL STATE THAT ARE BEING USED THAT IS UTILIZED RIGHT NOW AS THE GATEKEEPERS AFTER MAKE MUCH BIGGER. EVEN MORE TO BE NOTHING THAT THANK. THANK WHEN AS CHAIR BY DOCUMENT DANIEL THIS IS A DISK. IN IN OF ITS WHY IS IT BEING TREATED SO DIFFERENTLY SO THAT B. R. IT IT. ALL I DO I DO WANT TO ADD THE THAT THE DIVERSITY OF THE STUDENTS THAT COME IN- FOR EIGHT ECONOMIST MADE HIS ALSO CHANGE OF THERE IS THE FACT THAT EVERYONE WHO IS SHE GOT A- INCREASING. WHAT THE MEN AND WANT TO TEACH THE AREA. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM- THE DALLAS. COMMITTEE NOW. YES MR GABRIEL. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HAVE TO SAY YOU ARE A SUCH A GOOD REPRESENTATIVE OF YOUR COMMUNITY I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT WE HAVE SOME YOU THE RIVER SO THERE. WELL IN FRONT. I THOUGHT PROVOKING- TESTIMONY TODAY I JUST WANT TO SHARE A FEW REMARKS BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUN OUT IN A SECOND I WAS REFLECTING A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT I. AND ON. CONRAD HAS WORKED WELL FOR US- AND WHERE WE'VE RUN INTO CHALLENGES AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD TODAY. THAT I'VE ACTED ON A LOT IS. BRINGING THE DIVERT THEIR THE BROADEST DIVERSITY OF VOICES INTO THE PROCESS AS WE THINK ABOUT THIS- THAT BRINGING PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY AND PROCESS- I HAVE TRIED. THIS REVERENCE. FOR ALL OF WHOM HAVE WORKED IN OUR STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. AND I WAS THINKING OF YOUR DOCTOR OPERATIVE MI MY GRANDFATHER SPENT- MANY DECADES ATTACK STATUS- AND WAS ACTIVE IN THE HEALTHCARE FACULTY ASSOCIATION. AND HE CAME TO SAC STATE- HE CAME FROM AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY OF NO MONEY HE GRADUATED WITH FULL SCHOLARSHIP WITH GREEN ENGINE AND YORK. FINALLY A- KNOWN. FUTURE CAME UP THE WEST COAST SIR PROPERTY AND HIS ENTIRE AT CSU AND IT WAS- I JUST FEEL SO PASSIONATE BECAUSE I ASKED BEYOND TIRED COMMITTEE THE ROLE MIDDLE CLASS AND SERVING AS AN ENGINE OF SOCIAL MOBILITY PREPARING THE NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IF. IMPORTANT PEOPLE- BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE GOT TO HAVE A BROAD DIVERSE ARRAY OF FOLKS AND WHEN WE HAVE GOTTEN GOOD CURRICULUM. THE MODEL CAR THE PEOPLE HAVE FELT ABOUT THE DELORES HUERTA SHIRLEY WEBER LEADERS FOR COMPANY COMMUNITIES. ABOUT ITS BECAUSE WE WANT A LOT OF WAYS WE'VE GOT A LOT PLACES IN DON'T. FROM DIFFERENT. WHAT THE TO STAR HOW WE CONSTRUCT A ON THAT WERE FOR THIS EXCEPT A DIVERSE STATE THAT WE LIVE IN- WITH PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD SPEAK UP OF LIKE AND ALL THE KINDS BACK ON SINCE YOU KNOW BEING THE SON. THE GREAT ACADEMIC I'M ALSO FROM THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. ARGUMENTS WITH THE POINTS I THINK ABOUT THE- X. OF MY- OWN WHO'S ABOUT PROFESSOR USE JUST. WHO FOR. A LOT ON HOW DO WE TEACH MATH AND R. K. TWELVE. RATE ARGUMENT IN THE CASE. BETWEEN TENSIONERS BETWEEN I COULD ABOUT THE MOST UP WAY HOW SHOULD WE TEACH MATH AND YOU KNOW CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT MATH OR ARE INDISPUTABLE BUT THE- HOW DO YOU TEACH THE DIVERSE STATE. HARSTAD IN THEIR NUMBERS IN OUR PEOPLE COMING TO THE TABLE SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE'RE INCLUDING OUR FACULTY I THINK WE- THE BROADEST GROUP PROPERTY POSSIBLE BUT I ALSO INCLUDE A LOT STAKEHOLDERS AND WE- BOTH OF IT. WE HAVE. IN TWO THE DIVERSITY OUR STATE THAT'S HOW I GET THE STRAW PROPONENTS WOULD JUST OFFER THAT AS MY PERSPECTIVE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU SHARE FOR THE CURRENT I THANK THE WITNESSES AS WELL. IT IT IT JUST ON THE- LITTLE BIT FEARS DAY GABRIEL AND THINK ONE OF. THE STRENGTHS OF ETHNIC STUDIES. IS THAT. AS A DISCIPLINE BECAUSE WHERE IT CAME KNOW ETHNIC STUDIES WAS A- A CRITIQUE ON OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM A CRITIQUE OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT WAS IN PLACE AND IT IS. PUBLIC EDUCATION BEGAN AND IT WAS A CRITIQUE SAYING THAT CERTAIN GROUPS HAD BEEN OMITTED. AND CERTAIN FOLKS HISTORIES AND VALUES HAD BEEN A MINUTE SO BECAUSE IT COMES FROM THE BOTTOM UP INHERENTLY AN ETHNIC STUDIES THEREIS THAT OF INCLUDING THE CAN. AS WE- WE'RE AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES AND THEN AS WE GO TO IMPLEMENT- ETHNIC STUDIES I THINK WE WOULD WOULD HEAR FROM ALL OUR OTHER EDUCATIONAL FOLKS THAT THE COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO BEING INCLUDED AND SO WHEN I TURN YOUR CHOI I SAID THE- I. CAUGHT ON DOCTOR CHECK- TO COME AND SPEAK TO OUR USD IT WASN'T SO MUCH BECAUSE OF HIS ACADEMIC AND HE DIDN'T EVEN COME FROM IT- AT FROM THAT DIRECTION IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO FOR THE COMMUNITY. AND YOU KNOW I WENT TO A CONGRESSMAN TO CONDOS MOTHER NANCY TO KHAN WHO PASSED AWAY SOON AFTER THE MEETING AND NANCY TOCADO CON THE CONDOS- MOM HAD BEEN IN THE INTERMENT YOU KNOW HAD BEEN ENTERED DURING THE WORLD WAR TWO SHE HAD THE HISTORY OF HAVING LIVED IN THE CAPS SO THE ONE OF THE STRENGTH THAT IS TO GROUP. THAT THAT IS DRAWS UPON THE COMMUNITY AND THE COMMUNITY'S HISTORY. IN WHAT IS TAUGHT- SO THAT'S KIND OF IN HER INHERENT IN ETHNIC STUDIES AND JUST JUST TO SHARE THE- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MR BLOW. NOW I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION- THAT YOU GET YOU BROUGHT OUT I THINK- DR I WILL LET YOU BROUGHT OUT. THE T. DEGREE T. AN ETHNIC STUDIES MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT. TO BECOME A TEACHER. BUT SOMETIMES DEPENDING IF YOU DON'T HAVE. OF FOR EXAMPLE AT NORTHRIDGE THEY HAVE THE SUBJECT MATTER AUTHORIZATION THROUGH ETHNIC STUDIES RIGHT. AT SACRAMENTO THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND SO IF A STUDENT IS AN ETHNIC STUDIES MAJOR AND WANTS TO ENSURE THE TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAM THEY HAVE TO SHOW SOME MATTER COMPETENCY BUT THAT'S NOT I DIDN'T SEE. NOW IS SOCIAL SCIENCE. IT SO THEN NOT ONLY WITH THEY HAVE TO. TAKE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR OWN MAJOR RIGHT BUT THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO ALSO TAKE ALL THE COURSES. THAT THIS DANCE DISCIPLINE SAYS IS NECESSARY TO SHOW SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPETENCY. AND SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK YOU SEE THE EQUITY RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF WORK THAT AN ETHNIC STUDIES MAJOR. PASSED YOU THINK THAT SOMEONE WILL SET A PERFECT WAS A JUST A POWERFUL THING SHE SAYS YOU KNOW I THINK THIS. COULD NOT LOOK THAT AS OR DO IN THE SAME WAY AS- ENGLISH AS DID THE OTHER DIFFERENT SUBJECT MATTERS AND THAT IS WHAT HAS. MY WHAT I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW OUR CAMPUS AND ACROSS THE STATE AS WE CONTINUE TO ORGANIZE COLLECTIVELY AND HOPEFULLY FORMING- WHICH IS THAT IF SOMEONE VALUES IDEA OF A CONSORTIUM BETWEEN. COLLEGES PROFESSORS IN TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND PROFESSORS THAT MAKE STUDIES TO RUDY- MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THAT INTERSECTION ALITY THAT EXISTS. IT STUDENT SITE IT'S TOO MUCH COURSE WORK IT'S GOING TO EXTEND MY STATE IT'S GOING TO I'M GONNA BE HERE FIVE SIX YEARS IF I HAVE TO DO ALL THIS ISSUE DON'T CATCH THEM EARLY ENOUGH- TO BE ABLE TO. TO HAVE THOSE COURSES THEN- THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE C. SET. AND THE C. SAID BUT- FOR MANY- BY PARKS WOULDN'T. HAS BEEN VERY BIAS WITH RESPECT TO THAT- AND THE CONTENT AS I SHARED IN MY STATEMENT DOES NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE DISCIPLINE WHICH THEY WERE. THAT THEY STUDIED IN WHICH WAS ETHNIC STUDIES AND IT'S COSTLY AND SO THERE'S ALL THESE DIFFERENT- IS THAT COME INTO PLAY THAT I THINK THAT Y. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT MY OPINION THAT UP AND- I. MY CALL CRISIS. COMPACT ARE SHARING THE POWERFUL WHAT THE HAPPENING EVEN ON ALL CAMPUS THE POWERFUL WORK THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WE FOR THE- AT THE SAME. WE HAVE TO PUSH- SEE. THAT COULD BE THE BY ALL OF YOU THINK IT INTEREST. THAT THE RIVERS THAT DOCTOR AVILA IS NOT TRUE THAT I HEARD FROM FROM THE COMMISSION ON CREDENTIALING THAT YOU HAVE THE SOCIAL STUDIES CREDENTIAL YOU HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO JUST THAT ETHNIC-STUDIES BUT IF YOU HAVE THE ETHNIC STUDIES CREDENTIAL YOU HAVE TO PROVE. THAT THANK YOU CAN TEACH SOCIAL STUDIES SO EXACTLY YEAH I GET IT AND WE CAN HAVE A WHOLE OTHER CONVERSATION ON THAT OR NOT WELL THAT SHOWS THAT SHOWS THERE'S A- REAL. EXACTLY AT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO PASS. UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND- THAT WAS THE LAST PANEL SO THEN WE WILL NOW OPEN IT UP. TO PUBLIC COMMENT- AND THE PUBLIC COMMENTS- LIMIT LIMIT- PUBLIC COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES AND I HAVE MY TIMER HERE YOURSELF AND I WOULD START THE TIMER FOR TWO MINUTES HE- YES GOOD ACTORS DR MELISSA MORENO AND I AM A COLLEAGUE OF MINE ELECTED OFFICIAL FOR A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION BUT I'M ALSO MOST IMPORTANTLY A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ETHNIC STUDIES FACULTY AND SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE FOR THE COMMITTEE TO REALLY KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM ONLY PAYS FOR STUDENTS TO DO ONE MAJOR. FILL MY STUDENTS HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN AN ETHNIC STUDIES. RIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT AND SO RIGHT NOW THAT IS EIGHTY CHAPTERS STRUGGLE IT RELATES TO WHAT DOCTOR BET THEM OUT OF FABULA IN SAINT ETHNIC STUDIES RETAINS THEM. AND THAT'S HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO SUCCEED AT PROCESS BUT YOU GET THEY HAVE A LOT IN THE- IN FRONT. OF THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THERE ONLY GET PAID. ONCE WE PETER PIPER THE MY OF OUR STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR ARE AT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEY NEED A PATH IN UC'S. VIEW ARE WE DEFINITELY NEED A COURSE IN EDUCATION- ETHNIC STUDIES FOR EDUCATORS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR THAT TO BE A BRIDGE- WE DEFINITELY NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT NOT ALL ETHNIC STUDIES- OUR HISTORY PROJECTS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO SERVE ALL OF THEIR- COMMUNITY. SO IT IT'S REAL IN TO. KEEP IN MIND ALSO THAT RIGHT NOW COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE NOT NECESSARILY SEEN OF THEMSELVES AS BEING THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR- THE CREDENTIALS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENTS FOR ALL OF THEIR A DISTRICTS BECAUSE OF LOCAL CONTROL. COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION FOCUSES ON CONTINUATION JUVENILE HALL SPECIAL ED BUT THE LEAVE THAT THE DISTRICTS ARE LIKE THEIR OWN ENTITIES. SOMEONE WHO. YEAH ADDRESS AROUND TEACHING CREDENTIALS BUT THAT'S NOT HISTORICALLY WHAT WHAT IT IS WHAT IT'S BEEN THERE IS A MAJOR AND THIS IS MY LAST POINT THERE IS A MAJOR SEVERE TEACHER SHORTAGE RIGHT NOW WE DEFINITELY NEED FUNDING FOR EDUCATORS WE CANNOT AFFORD FOR OUR OUR STUDENTS RIGHT TO SAY I'M NOT GOING TO MAJOR IN ETHNIC STUDIES AND NOT GOING TO BE A TEACHER BECAUSE MY HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING I WILL BE ABLE COVERED. BY B. IN A ONE YEAR TEACHER WE DEFINITELY TO INCREASE THE FUNDING FOR ART TEACHERS TEACHING AND THE ARE THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING ALL OF THESE ARE POINTS THANK YOU. DR GOOD AFTERNOON- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THE MEDINA AND- COMMITTEE. OF MY NEAREST DOCTOR BARBER FOR LETTUCE AND I WEAR MANY HATS UP.

SOMEBODY FROM SOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL SAID THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT LEFT OUT YOU'VE LEFT US OUT THIS THE GOVERNING BOARDS OF THE STATE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH WOMEN TEAM THANKS STUDIES. AND SO WE NEED PEOPLE THAT ARE QUALIFIED WE NEED PEOPLE THAT HAVE CONTENT KNOWLEDGE OF ETHNIC STUDIES IN THE MEANTIME WE NEED PEOPLE TO HAVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SO SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE MADE REGARDING HAVING SEARCH. AND WEBER- COLLEAGUE ARE DOCTOR TENNIS TINY WRECK. THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE FIVE COURSES I MEAN THERE'S A MODEL THERE LET'S USE OUT CTC HAS TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE. OUR TO UP YOU KNOW. WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA FOR THE SUBJECT MATTER- COMPETENCIES ALL SIX THIRTY SCHOLARS AND PROFESSORS IN PROGRAMS AND- DEPARTMENTS OF THE FIX CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS EVIDENCED BY OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN KNOWLEDGE. WE HAVE JOINTLY NUMBER WORK WITH FOR THAT UP WITH MY CAR- DOCTOR LOU RODRIGUEZ- MENTIONED THEY HAVE PATHWAYS WELL THOSE PATHWAYS ARE IMPORTANT BUT ALSO IMPORTANT IN OUR- LOOKED LOCATION WE HAVE TO ALSO. BEGIN TO HAVE PASSED HE'S IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS AS WELL FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR KIDS ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE FIX STUDIES THEY ARE DOWNEY. TO KNOW ABOUT THEMSELVES ABOUT THEIR HISTORIES ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW. ONCE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE YOU CAN YOU CAN. WELL IN THAT HISTORY IS. YOU CAN THAT THIS COMMITTEE I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT YOU'RE THE LEGISLATORS DO YOU EIGHT LEGISLATURE YOU TAP C. T. C. THIS IS YOU HAVE TO. AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS DR THERESA WILLIAMS LEON AND- I'M ACTUALLY BOTH IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN STUDIES DEPARTMENT BUT TODAY I'M HERE TO SPEAK AS AN ASIAN AMERICAN STATE FACULTY AT CAL STATE. AN MOTHER FROM JAPAN AND A AN ELEVENTH GENERATION EUROPEAN AMERICAN OF MILITARY VETERAN FATHER I'M MARRIED TO A MEXICAN AMERICAN MAN OF WHO IS THE SON OF TO. ME AND DOTTER I'M SAD TO SAY THAT SHE'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS BECAUSE SHE GRADUATES IN TWENTY TWELVE FOR. I'M HERE WHO- IMPRESSED UPON ALL OF YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VOICES OF ETHNIC STUDIES- EDUCATORS SCHOLARS PRACTITIONERS THOSE OF US WHO ARE TRAINED IN AN ETHNIC STUDIES. I COULD H. D. AND SO BALAJI ON YOURS AND SOCIOLOGY AND A MASTER'S IN ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES AT UCLA. AND ALSO A TICKET THE. S. OR AN ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES PROFESSOR IT REALLY WAS THE RESEARCH SKILLS THE CRITICAL PEDAGOGY- AND THE INTERDISCIPLINARY OF THE TRAINING THAT I RECEIVED IN. ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES ENOUGH STUDIES. ANY UP WHO ARE AT STEP PERFECT- VERY MUCH LIKE OUR OWN STUDENTS WE ARE FOR. MANY OF US ARE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE- DEMOCRATS. AND SO WE COME FROM THE COMMUNITIES WE ARE THE COMMUNITY MUCH LIKE OUR STUDENTS SO I JUST WANTED TO IMPRESS UPON ALL OVER AND I DID WANT TO SAY. MY DEPARTMENT WE HAVE WITH THE- AMERICAN STUDIES PATH TO SPUR. THE ETHNIC STUDIES EDUCATION PATHWAYS PROJECT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH FACULTY ACROSS ETHNIC STUDIES AS WELL AS IN EDUCATION- AND SO I I'D LIKE IMPRESSED UPON ALL OF YOU THAT- IN- IN. THOSE OF US WHO ARE EDUCATORS AND ETHNIC STUDIES- WHEN IMPLEMENTING- YOU KNOW THE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS IN THE CAPE YOU TWELVE INSTITUTION SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU DINA ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COLLEAGUES THIS IS THIS IS AN EXCITING MOMENT OF SADDAM I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE SO ENERGIZED BY IT BUT I'M GLAD I AM I'M NOT GONNA MORE. AND STATION. ADDITIONALLY WHITE STUDIES I SEE THAT DESCRIPTIVELY SOME PEOPLE TAKE IT A DIFFERENT WAY I WANT TO CLEAR THAT IT'S A DESCRIPTIVELY AND HAPPEN NOTHING STUDIES AS A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND H. CYCLE IN TRADITIONALLY WHITE STUDIES SAUSAGE OF WHITE I COLLEGES PARKING PROUD OF IT. AN IT'S ALSO A PROFESSOR I PROFESSOR OF ETHNIC STUDIES AND THE FOR JUST FORMER DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF ETHNIC STUDIES DISCUSSED. FINALLY HERE ARE THE- CSU COUNCIL OF THE SO- I COME HERE NOT WITH ALL THOSE HATS ON. HIS TWO ONE BUT- SO I COME AS A COLLEAGUE BUT I WANT TO COME AS A COLLEAGUE IN PUBLIC SERVICE WHICH CONNECTS ALL OF US. AND I WANT TO THE- D. CORE THEMES THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING IN DRAWING OUT OF PEOPLE. ARE IN THINKING FROM A PUBLIC. EDUCATION PERSPECTIVE FIRST K. ONE UNLIKE COMMERCIAL VENDORS OF SAY ICE CREAM OR CHEESE WHEN WE WERE COMMISSIONED TO DELIVER ETHNIC STUDIES OUR PRODUCT MUST BE WHAT THE NAME SAYS OKAY IF YOU DID YOUR STORE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT IS SO THEREFORE ETHNIC STUDIES MUST EXPERTS MUST VERIFY THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NO OTHER CONSULTATION WILL DO IT EVERY DAY EVEN IF. THERE'S NOT A GETS YEAH. NOT CAN. FOR YEARS- SO THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE IT'S GOING TO BE CONSULTED BUT YOU BEST GREAT QUESTIONS THAT I THINK SHOWED. A BIT OF- LACK OF DEPTH AND CLARITY IN SOME QUARTERS ON WHAT ETHNIC STUDIES WAS IN A LACK OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THEY HAD TALKED TO ETHNIC STUDIES. IT'S EVEN JUST OPENED OUR CATALOGS AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF CLASSES HUNDREDS. SO IT CAN'T BE THIS THIS THIS ONLY AND IT'S A DISCIPLINE IT'S NOT A TOPIC IT'S NOT THE STUDY OF ETHNICITY. IT IS THE DISCIPLINE BUILT. FROM THE INTELLECTUAL TRADITIONS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND ASPIRATIONS OF RACIALIZED AMERICAN GROUPS OKAY. THAT OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED I'M SURE. SO ANOTHER DIFFICULT ONE FOR US TO GRAPPLE WITH HIS. SOME INCLUDING ME MAY WANT MANY WONDERFUL CHANGES IN THE CURRICULUM K. THROUGH TWELVE. AND WE HAVE AT LEAST SIXTY COURSES K. TWELVE STUDENTS TAKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE COURSE IN ETHNIC STUDIES. I BELIEVE IT INTELLECTUALLY. LIMITING AND A RECIPE FOR FAILURE TO TRY TO REMEDY EVERYTHING THAT THE CURRENT TRADITIONALLY WHAT STUDIES CURRICULUM DOESN'T DO IN THAT ONE COURSE HOWEVER HE IS THE PROMISE AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE WITH THE DISCIPLINE WAS BORN. IT WAS BORN IT WAS BORN AS A MULTI ETHNIC INCLUDING PROGRESSIVE WHITES COALITION THE DECIDED WHAT IT NEED TO BE AND THEN ITS ENERGY BURST WOMEN'S STUDIES QUEER STUDIES JEWISH STUDIES PERSIAN STUDIES DISABILITY STUDIES. IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AROUND. YOU PLANT THE FIRST SEED AND YOU GROW THE REST OF THE PLANTS THE THIRD THIS IS GOING TO BE CHALLENGING BECAUSE WE'RE JUST STARTING. IT ALWAYS IS GETTING BACK TO EXERCISE. IT'S HARD BUT ETHNIC STUDIES FACULTY HAVE ALREADY CREATED MODELS OF TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES IN THE HIGH SCHOOL THEY HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED AS NOT JUST GOOD INTELLECTUAL QUALITY WHICH IS ALL IT REALLY SHOULD HAVE TO PROMISE BUT AS SUCCESS AS MOTIVATORS OF SUCCESS AND ACHIEVEMENT FOR STUDENTS OF ALL ETHNICITIES AND GENDERS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT OTHERS HAVE DONE SO WHAT DOES THE QUESTION OF YOU CAN DO WITH INSIGHT INTO THIS WHAT LANDFILLS OF THE COURSE IS DOING WHAT THE- COURSE IS DOING. SO ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL OF ETHNIC STUDIES BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT THAT THAT THAT'S THE LAST THING. THANK YOU. ON BEHALF OF COUNCIL THAT THE STUDIES I'M HERE TO% OFFER YOU THE FULL SUPPORT OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED EXPERTS. THAT YOU ALREADY SUPPORT LEGISLATIVELY WHO ARE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU AND THEN. YEAH MISTER BLOOM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I HAVE BELIEF I KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE WHO ARE PROBABLY WAY TO GIVE THE PUBLIC COMMENT- BY TELEPHONE- AND UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T STAY FOR THAT BUT I DID WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS VERY INFORMATIVE HEARING- I'VE BEEN A SUPPORTER- OF- THE ETHNIC STUDIES- A PROPOSAL FROM FROM INCEPTION FROM WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO ME AND SAID I WANT TALK ABOUT THE STATE'S IMPORT- AND IT THINK I DID- INTUITIVELY. AND IT IS SAFER SO MANY KOREANS ARE A BECAUSE THIS IS. I'M UNDERTAKING IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE BEEN SOME BUMPS IN THE ROAD- AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND- SO MANY OF THOSE HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING ALSO APPEARED- TODAY THAT THERE ARE STILL ISSUES SAID THAT THAT REQUIRE. A RESOLUTION- OBSTACLES. ARE THERE FOR US TO SOLVE. AND I HAVE. WE WILL FIND TO AS WE MOVE FOR THE RIGHT PROPER A PATHWAY AROUND THOSE OBSTACLES SO THAT- THIS VERY IMPORTANT MOVEMENT- AND- DISCIPLINE CAN FLOURISH IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- CEASELESS AND CONSTANT SUPPORT OF ETHNIC STUDIES. THANK YOU. N. AND NOW I WILL GO TO THE PHONES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE WILL AGAIN LIMIT PUBLIC COMMENT TO TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE WHO WHO CAME IN PERSON MODERATOR COULD WE GO TO THE PHONES AND SEE WE HAVE ANY ANYONE WAITING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. THAT COMMAND AGAIN ONE SEVEN ZERO. HEY WE HAVE A COMMENT FROM LINE FIFTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES MY NAME IS NICOLE YANG AND I AM THE CHAPTER CHAIR FOR PATRICK COUNTY MOM COOPER MCCARTY AND I'M ALSO A MEXICAN AMERICAN. AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE LISTENED TO THE TESTIMONY. AND AS A MEXICAN AMERICAN WOMAN I KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM I KNOW MY ROOTS AND I KNOW MY CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY I ALSO SEE THE DISMAL STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT IS THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE WE'RE- CURRENTLY RANKED LAST IN EDUCATION. I ATTENDED SOME OF THE WORST PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN SOME OF THE WORST NEIGHBORHOODS IN CALIFORNIA AND MY SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL DROP OUT RATE WITH FIFTY PERCENT- WE WERE PREDOMINANTLY MINORITIES. WE WERE NOT GRADUATING BECAUSE OF LACK OF ETHNIC STUDIES WE ARE NOT GRADUATING BECAUSE WE HAD A LACK OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS I THINK THAT THE EDUCATE HIGHER EDUCATION NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED MORE ON PREPARING THE TEACHERS TO EDUCATE TODAY'S YOUTH. AND LAST ON RACIAL INEQUALITY WELL THEY DO HAPPEN. THEY'RE NOT AT THE FOREFRONT OF MOST CHILDREN'S MINDS AND THEY'RE NOT HOLDING CHILDREN BACK. AT I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE OF ETHNIC STUDIES IS TO ACTUALLY BE ETHNIC PEOPLE STUDYING WHICH COMES FROM QUALIFIED TEACHERS. AND EDUCATING CHILDREN ON THE BASICS OF READING WRITING. ANALOGICAL REASONING SKILLS AND IF WE HOLD THE STANDARDS WITHOUT IN THIRTEEN RACE AND ETHNICITY AND ETHNIC STUDIES AND PICKING CURRICULUM THAT THE CHILDREN. THE CHILDREN ALL RIGHT THE OCCASION WE WILL SEE MORE TEACHERS WE WILL SEE MORE PEOPLE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION. SYSTEM AND WEALTHY EQUALITY TRULY QUALITY. NOT CAN YOU FAX YOUR EQUITY FROM THE STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT CALLER. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME VERY GOOD WELL I WILL THANK THE STAFF EVERYONE HERE ALL STAFF MY STEP FROM THE COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION- THE- PEOPLE CAME TO TESTIFY BOTH IN PERSON AND- AND REMOTELY. AND JUST WANT TO SAY IN CLOSING THAT. A LOT OF WORK BEING DONE- MOSTLY BY THE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING YES YOU SEE. AIR TEACHERS WHO ARE GOING TO GO INTO OUR CLASSROOMS WHO WILL BE TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES. BUT I THINK THE OTHER MESSAGE THAT I GOT WAS THAT. FORTUNATELY THE- TEACHER CREDENTIALING HAS NOT APPARENTLY EVEN GIVEN IT ENOUGH THOUGHT TO HOW THEY ARE GOING TO ENSURE. THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA BE IN THE CLASSROOMS TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES ARE INDEED QUALIFIED TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES SO THIS IS THE FIRST. HEARING THAT I AM CONVENING ON THIS TOPIC AND WE WILL CONVENE ANOTHER HEARING AND HOPEFULLY AT THAT TIME I WOULD SEE SOME PROGRESS. ON THE COMMISSION ON TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND CAN COME BACK SOME IDEAS OF IN WHAT DIRECTION DO THEY WANT TO SEE- CREDENTIALING GOING SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT ALL TEACHERS WHO ARE IN THE CLASSROOM TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES. ARE INDEED QUALIFIED TO TEACH THAT CLASS AND WITH THAT WE ARE CAN BE. THE JURY.
