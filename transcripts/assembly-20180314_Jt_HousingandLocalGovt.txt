GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO TODAY'S JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY. DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE AND THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DAVID CHIU I CHAIR THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE AND IN A MOMENT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. BUT TODAY'S HEARING IS TO DO A REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF CURRENT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOOLS. I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT REDEVELOPMENT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN TOOLS USED BY LOCALS TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MANY OTHER THINGS. AND IT'S A LOSS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE HAS HELPED TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS. AT THE TIME OF DISSOLUTION REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE OBLIGATED TO SPEND OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND. IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THAT THE LOSS OF THESE FUNDS HAS ACCOMPANIED A RISE IN HOMELESSNESS AND THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. WITH REGARDS TO AFFORDABILITY. NOW IN THE WAKE OF REDEVELOPMENT THE LEGISLATURE CREATED VARIOUS TOOLS TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A SMORGASBORD OF ACRONYMS CREUS YEAH OF DIS HA IS NIFTY SITS. ALL OF THESE TOOLS ARE VOLUNTARY FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT WANT TO USE A PORTION OF PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT. BUT WHAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED IS THAT THESE TOOLS HAVE NOT. BOEING LARGE OF BEEN AS ROBUST AS REDEVELOPMENT. AND WE WILL CERTAINLY HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT WHY THAT IS THE CASE. OF THE GOAL OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO EXPLORE THE LANDSCAPE OF THE POST REDEVELOPMENT WORLD. LOOK AT VARIOUS TOOLS EXAMINE HOW THEY'RE WORKING. GIVEN OUR STATE STABLE FISCAL HEALTH AT THIS POINT. THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN FURTHER INVEST IN HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE. I WILL MENTION. THAT I AM I HAVE BEEN CONVENING. LITTLE BIT OF A WORKING GROUP WITH A. A VARIETY OF OF MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT RESPECT REFLECT I THINK THAT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR LEGISLATURE. THERE IS DEFINITELY INTEREST AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE MOVE LEGISLATION FOR IN THIS AREA AND PART OF THIS HEARING. IS TO. INFORM THAT PROCESS SO WITH THAT. I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MY CULTURE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR ALL KINDS. I AM ALSO ONE I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WILL BE PRODUCED IN SUPPORT DISCUSSION TODAY. I JUST SEE WILL BE HAVING PEOPLE COMING AND GOING BECAUSE OF NUMEROUS WHO COMMITTEE MEETINGS. MY GOAL TODAY IS TO WALK AWAY WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PAST THE PRESENT AND SOME TAKEAWAYS FOR THE FUTURE. WILD REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S HEARING WE CAN'T HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT CURRENT TAX INCREMENT TOOLS WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING HOW WE GOT HERE. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THE CURRENT TOOLS WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING HEARING REASONS WHY THEY MAY NOT BE. AND A LISTEN TO OUR SPEAKERS PROVIDE OVERALL ANALYSIS ABOUT THE STATE OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I'M ALSO VERY INTERESTED IT TO HEAR THE FINAL PANEL ON OTHER PERSPECTIVES AND WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. LIKE MY DISTRICT. WE CANNOT LEAVE OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES OUT OF THIS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSION. WITH THAT I LIKE TO BRING UP BRIAN MUELLER OR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO HELP US SET THE TABLE ON TAX INCREMENT AS A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOOL WELCOME. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME OWE YES I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE US SOME BACKGROUND ON TAXING GROUP FINANCING IN CALIFORNIA. IN GENERAL A TAX INCREMENT FINANCING IS A TOOL THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE USED FOR MANY YEARS. TO FINANCE A VARIETY OF PROJECTS TO BE THAT VERY SUBS OF INFRASTRUCTURE OR PUBLIC REVITALIZATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OR. AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN GENERAL TAX INCREMENT FINANCING A WORKS BY HAVING A LOCAL GOVERNMENT IDENTIFY A PORTION OF THEIR JURISDICTION. THAT THEY FEEL NEEDS SOME SOME ADDITIONAL PUBLIC INVESTMENT. IN. MAKING THE DECISION TO ALLOCATE FUTURE GROWTH AND PROPERTY TAX REVENUES FROM PROPERTIES WITHIN THAT AREA. TO HELP FUND OF THE DESIRED PROJECTS AND USUALLY OF THIS WORKS BY A DEDICATING THE STREAM OF FUTURE GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUES TO REPAYMENT OF OF A BOND. IN USING THE BOND PROCEEDS. TO FUND. THE DESIRED PROJECTS. FOR MANY YEARS UP UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN IT WAS A ELIMINATED REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE THE. PRIMARY TOOL USED BY WILL GOVERNMENT THE PRIMARY TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TOOL USED BY A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND UNDER REDEVELOPMENT A CITY OR COUNTY A COULD CREATE A REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY THAT. THAT IDENTIFIED BROUGHT REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREAS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION. WITHIN WHICH TAX INCREMENT FINANCING WOULD BE USED TO FUND A PLAN OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS WHICH COULD INCLUDE A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES. FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND STATE LAW REQUIRED THAT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FUNDING I HAD TO GO. TOWARDS FURTHERING THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING THAT WAS AFFORDABLE A FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH LOW AND MODERATE INCOME. NO REDEVELOPMENT. BEFORE TERMINATION WAS A VERY POPULAR AMONG WILL GOVERNMENTS. THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN AGENCIES A STATEWIDE THAT OVERSAW SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE A PROJECT AREAS AND RECEIVED ABOUT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE. IMPROPER TAX REVENUE WHICH AT THE TIME. WAS ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT A OF STATEWIDE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. AND NOT MANY FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO A MAKING RTA AN ATTRACTIVE A TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TOOL OF IT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A TWO. ELEMENTS OF FREE DISCUSSION TODAY THE FIRST IS. IN GENERAL WHEN. CITY OR COUNTY WANTS TO PUT FORWARD A BOND THAT IS BACKED BY PROPERTY TAXES TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN GENERAL THAT REQUIRES THEM TO RECEIVE A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THEIR A LOCAL ELECTORATE TO MOVE THAT BOND FORWARD. UNDER REDEVELOPMENT A CITY OR COUNTY COULD THROUGH THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY ISSUE A BOND THAT WAS BACKED BY THE GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAXES. AND AND THE ISSUANCE OF THAT BOND I DIDN'T REQUIRE A FURTHER APPROVAL FROM. VOTERS. A SECOND ELEMENT IS THAT REDEVELOPMENT GAVE A. CITIES AND COUNTIES ACCESS TO REVENUES THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ACCESS TO. ON THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATION A WORKS IN CALIFORNIA. A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INDEPENDENTLY LEVY A TAX READING COLLECT. PROPERTY TAX REVENUES FROM THE PROPERTIES THEY SERVE INSTEAD. EACH PROPERTY PAYS A SET ONE PERCENT RATE. AND THE REVENUES DERIVED FROM THAT ONE PERCENT RATE ARE DIVVIED ACROSS ALL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT SERVE THAT PROPERTY SO USUALLY A CITY. A COUNTY A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND VERY SUCH A SPECIAL DISTRICT ME LIKE A FIRE DISTRICT OUR LIBRARY DISTRICT. AND THE DIVVYING UP OF THOSE REVENUES ACROSS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS DETERMINED BY FORMULA SUDDEN STAY LOST OF THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T HAVE. TROLL OVER THE ALLOCATION OF THESE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. UNDER REDEVELOPMENT A A CITY OR COUNTY COULD AGAIN CONTROL OVER. NOT JUST THEIR SHARE OF THE GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUES FROM A SET OF PROPERTIES. ABOUT THE REVENUE. THIS YEAR'S REVENUES THAT WOULD HAVE GONE A TO OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES. AS WELL. AND. THIS DID HAVE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OTHER A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A. AND IT HAS FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE AS WELL. ALTHOUGH THE STATE DOESN'T RECEIVE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. STATE FINANCING SCHOOL FINANCING LAWS REQUIRE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECEIVE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF FUNDING THROUGH A COMBINATION OF LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. AND ST JOURNAL FUND DOLLARS. AND SO WHEN A LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS. ARE REALLOCATED TO OTHER PURPOSES. LIKE. REDEVELOPMENT A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THEN STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO THE BACK FILL THOSE THOSE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. IN THE IN THE LAST YEAR BEFORE IN THE LAST YEAR OF REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. THIS AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE REALLOCATED FROM SCHOOLS WAS ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE WHICH NECESSITATED. A TWO BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND. BACKFILL TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND SO WHILE THIS รณ THIS WAS AN ATTRACTIVE FEATURE OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES FOR MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES. IT ALSO A CREATED SOME TENSIONS BECAUSE YOU HAD IN MANY CASES ONE ACTOR THAT WAS MAKING A DECISION THAT HAD FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR MANY INTERESTED PARTIES. A AND THIS IS. ATTENTION THAT CREATED OTHER DROVER FORMS OR REDEVELOPMENT WAS IN PLACE AND ULTIMATELY. LEAD TO CONTRIBUTED TO ITS ELIMINATION. AND A. DEALING WITH THIS TENSION IS ONE OF THE THE KEY DIFFERENCES THAT SEPARATES OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES FROM THE CURRENT TAX INCREMENT FINANCING. TOOLS THAT ARE IN PLACE TODAY. WHERE IS REDEVELOPMENT ALLOWED A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO A GAIN? ACCESS TO ALL OF THE PROPERTY TAXES OF THE PROPER TEXTURES OF ALL OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE NEW TOOLS WHAT YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT FROM THE LATER PANEL SUCH AS THAT IT ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS IN THE QUEUE COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION INVESTMENT AREAS. THEY ARE MORE LIMITED IN SCOPE. ALLOWING ESSENTIALLY A CITY OR COUNTY TO GAIN ACCESS TO THEIR SHARE OF GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. AS WELL AS THE SHARES OF ANY NON EDUCATIONAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WOULD WANT TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS OF IT WOULD NOT ALLOW. THE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO GAIN ACCESS TO THIS THE SCHOOL SHARE OF THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE GROWTH. AND SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE BILL EVERY QUESTIONS. NO ONE FROM THE COMMITTEE FLORA GENSCHER OFTEN I GUESS BECAUSE I WAS A GOOD SUMMER. AS A REALLY GOOD SUMMARY WE'VE ALL BEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO WE CAN GET BACK. AT THE HISTORY OF IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE. YOUR TIME ON THIS SO WHY WE MOVE ON TO OUR PANEL ON THE ANALYSIS OF POST REDEVELOPMENT TAX INCREMENT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOOLS. AND THEM RODIN CARING FOR YOU COULD JOIN US AIR CALDWELL AND MICHAEL LANE. AND DAMN IT WILL START WITH YOU. DAN IS WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND WE'VE SEEN HIM MANY TIMES BEFORE BUT WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE A GOOD AFTERNOON OUR CHAIRS AND. MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. I DO HAVE A A POWER POINT TO MAKE SURE WITH COMMITTEE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A HANDOUT BUT USE THAT IS CUT THE BASIS FOR MY REMARKS. HE HAD SORT OF. BUILDING OFF OF. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WHICH ANALYSTS ON COMMENTS UP ONE OF THE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT ARM WAS. BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN SET UP A REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY THERE HAD TO BE THIS ANALYSIS IN THESE FINDINGS THAT WHAT FOR REDEVELOPMENT THE AREA WASN'T GONNA GET FIXED WASN'T GONNA GET FIXED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR BOND. IF THERE WERE BROWNFIELDS RATHER SORT OF PROBLEMS. IT END IN MAYBE THE GOVERNMENT ACTED ALONE SO THAT WAS KIND OF THIS THING THAT WE WE REALLY NEED TO A POWERFUL TOOL. IN THIS AREA OF A IN SO ANYWHERE THERE'S THIS IDEA BUT FOR AND SO. INTO IN THE IN THE PIE CHART I'VE GOT FROM THE PRIOR ALREADY A FUNDING HOME THE ELLIS IS CORRECT WHEN YOU SET UP ONE OF THESE ON ONE OF THESE AREAS YOU COULD TARGET A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LIFT INTO INTO FIXING WHATEVER THE PROBLEM WAS. NO THERE WAS A PROVISION IN THE REAR REDEVELOPMENT LAW FOR PASS THROUGHS TO BE NEGOTIATED AT IN SOME COUNTIES SO THEY THEY WERE ABLE TO GET MONEY. AS AS THE PROJECT GREW SOMETIMES WAS WERE NEGOTIATED SOMETIMES THEIR WORK OR NOT BUT CERTAINLY THE SCHOOL SHARE AND THE IMPLICATIONS ON ON PROP NINETY EIGHT WERE WERE WERE PART OF THE ISSUE. NOW. WE'VE ENTERED INTO. THAT HE A SORT OF THE POST REDEVELOPMENT WORLD AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OF NEW ATTACKS AND COMMIT TOOLS IN YOUR ANALYSIS KINDA WALKS THROUGH THEM. AND. A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANNA I WANNA POINT OUT WITH YOU COULD HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES ESPECIALLY WITH ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE DISTRICTS WILL GET INTO THAT IN IT A BIT MORE. BOOK BUT WITH REDEVELOPMENT IT WAS ABOUT THE WHERE YOU KNOW WAS THE AREA BLIGHTED DID IT MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT WORK THAT ALLOW THIS TOOL TO BE USED SO SO THE WHERE MATTERED A LOT. WITH E. IFD ARM YOU YOU REALLY THE ONLY BOUNDARIES OF ANY IFD OR POLITICAL AGREEMENT. AND FOR FOR THE. MISS SUPPORTER CURRIES A ISSUES WITH THE RURAL AREAS IT THIS IS DIFFERENT AND ACTUALLY I THINK HELP FOR IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IN RURAL AREAS IT AND HENCE SOLVING MAY SURGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES. BECAUSE IT WAS AT THIS YOU KNOW YOU MAY NOT BE TRYING TO CREATE A REVITALIZED DOWNTOWN OR SOMETHING IN IN A RULER YOU MAY BE JUST TRYING TO FIX A LEVY OR DO SOMETHING ELSE SO. YEAH I IF DIS OR FLEXIBLE ON THE WHERE. MUCH MORE SO THAN THAN THE FORMER TOOL AND AND THE CREEL LAW IS IS BACK TO THE OLD A REDEVELOPMENT IDEA OF IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THESE MORE POWERFUL TOOLS. THEN YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE SOME FOCUS ON ON WHERE THOSE TOOLS ARE APPLIED. ONE OF THE THINGS ARE OR THE THING ALL THESE TOOLS HAVING CARMEN IS. THAT YOU CAN TALK TO THE OTHER TAXING ENTITIES AS A CITY I CAN TALK TO THE COUNTY I CAN TALK TO THE SPECIAL DISTRICT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT. THEY BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN AND WHATEVER OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A WITH ANY OF THESE TOOLS. BUT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN TALK TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND REALLY IT'S REALLY A STATE ISSUE WITH WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT SO YOU REALLY SO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE REVENUE IF YOU WILL IS SORE OFF THE TABLE EVEN FOR. A FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE FROM FROM JUST EVEN THE DISCUSSION. IN ADDITION TO TAX INCREMENT AREN'T JUST COMING FROM THE GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX THERE'S A COUPLE WRINKLES THAT DID BUT THAT PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY. AT IT INTO IN TERMS OF REVENUE OPTIONS THAT THAT HE AYE OF G. KOREA AND THIS A AFFORDABLE HOUSING AUTHORITY TOOL HAVE. IN IN SO IN ADDITION JUST TO THE GROWTH THE PROPERTY TAX THERE SOME OTHER REVENUES THAT THAT CAN BE USED IN THOSE TOOLS. THERE'S THE PROPERTY TAX THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES GET. UP IN LIEU OF THE VLF THAT THE USED TO GET SO SO THAT'S PROTECTED UNDER PROPOSITION ONE EIGHT SO THEY GET AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX IN LIEU OF THIS VLF THAT. THAT WE USE TO GET ALL ALSO AS REDEVELOPMENT DEBTS WERE PAID OFF THESE RIDGES RESIDUALS IT'LL COME BACK TO A CITY COUNTY OR SPECIAL DISTRICT THESE TOOLS ALTHOUGH ALSO AUTHORIZE. A THOSE ENTITIES TO DIRECT SOME OF THOSE SUMMER ALL THOSE PORTIONS INTO. THESE DIFFER OUT. AND ARM. AND THEN THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED UNDER OTHER LAWS IT AND ALL THREE OF THESE LAWS E. AYE IF DE KOREA AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AUTHORITIES. ALLOW YOU TO CUT A COORDINATE WITH WITH SOME OF THOSE OTHER. TOOLS NOW OF COURSE WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING HAS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE LAWS BUT THAT ALLOW SOME COORDINATION SO THAT'S DIFFERENT IN A LITTLE MORE THAN THE OLD. ARE ALREADY A TOOL HAD HAD BY ITSELF. YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OF  <u><c.green>I A FIFTIES</c></u> INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THEY ALSO CAN FINANCE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT IF YOU LOOK AT MY LIST. UNDER THE UNDER THAT YOU CAN. FINANCE INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES. TRANSIT PRIORITY PROJECTS. WHATEVER INTEREST ENTRANCE OR IN DEVELOPMENT HERE PROJECTS IMPLEMENTING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY YOU COULD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND ARE ALSO IT SAYS FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED A HOUSE PROVIDERS OF CONSUMER GOODS AND SERVICES SO THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY EVEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR LEFTIES. WITH THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SIDE MORE THAN MAYBE SOME PEOPLE REALIZE AS I SAID ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STANDS OUT WITH THE I FD IS A REALLY IT ISN'T ABOUT THE. THE WHERE IS POLITICAL AGREEMENT YOU COULD HAVE HALF YOUR CITY YOU WOULD HAVE TO CITIES YOU CAN HAVE THE ENTIRE COUNTY IN EVERY CITY AT IT I MEAN JUST DEPENDS ON ON POLITICAL AGREEMENT. THERE IS A WRINKLE THOUGH IF THE E. IFT ISSUES ARM PONCE THERE HAVE TO BE A FIFTY FIVE PERCENT VOTE. THE THEY HAVE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY BEYOND BONDS BUT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CONSTRAINS THE WHERE. IS THE VOTE REQUIREMENT. NOW. THERE SAID IT DIFFERENT GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HEY LET'S WE WILL LET'S TRY TO BRING BACK REDEVELOPMENT. WILL KOREA IS REDEVELOPMENT NOW IT MAY NOT BE EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE. WANT HER MAYBE THEY WANT TO CHANGE IT BUT IN TERMS OF THE POWERS OF REDEVELOPMENT THEY'RE ALL THERE THEY'RE ALL IN IN THE CREEL LAW. THE OUR ABILITY TO. ISSUE DEBT OF WHAT WITHOUT REQUIRING A PUBLIC VOTE IT'S THEIR. IMMINENT DOMAIN TO DO WHAT ASSEMBLY IT'S THERE SO THE POWERS A REDEVELOPMENT OR THEIR. BUT ALSO THERE WERE SOME ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS THAT WERE INSERTED INTO LAW TO TRY TO. IMPROVE THE BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE AFFECTED IN THE COMMUNITY ON BY BY THIS TOOL IT AND THOSE IN CHARGE AND AND MEET MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME YOU KNOW. IMPROVEMENT TO THE LAW TO MAKE IT MAYBE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE BUT BUT BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT RDA AUTHORITY THERE'S A LOT TO BUILD ON. A IN THAT LAW THERE'S ALSO A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ON HOUSING SET ASIDE A IT WITH A LOT OF THE SAME CONDITIONS ARE THAT REQUIRE THAT APPLIED TO RDAS. THIS ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AUTHORITY A LAW THAT WENT THROUGH LAST YEAR I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY FLEXIBLE TOOL I MEAN I THINK IT'S IT'S UP IT'S GOT A NUMBER AND I KNOW THERE. WAS GOING TO BE A SPEAKER ON THAT BUT I DO THINK OF THEIR SOME THINGS TO. TO WORK WITH IN IN THAT LAW. THE. THAT MISTER BLOOM SO FIFTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHICH IS REALLY A AN OFFSHOOT OF THE I FD LAW. OF IT SAYS IF YOU CAN GET YOU CAN ACCESS SALES TAX GROWTH AS PART OF ANY IFT. BUT YOU HAVE TO EAT TWENTY PERCENT HOUSE TO GO FOR HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU ARE YOU CAN ONLY SPEND IT IN AN INFILL AREA AND YOUR ENTIRE E. I. F. DE HOUSE TO BE COTERMINOUS WITH THE BOUNDARIES OF YOUR OF YOUR CITY AND. BACK TO WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE FIFTY FIVE PERCENT VOTE AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE COTERMINOUS. BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO EXPLORE THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER THINGS ON THE SHELF ARE THERE IN THE LAW. ANNEXATIONS BETWEEN CITIES AND COUNTIES ESPECIALLY OF DISADVANTAGED AREAS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN CITIES LOOK TO IT. ANNEXING AREA IS THE DETERIORATED INFRASTRUCTURE HOW YOU GONNA CLEAN THIS UP THERE'S A OF A BILL IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS A CITY AND COUNTY AS PART OF THE LAUGH CHO PROCESS. TO AGREE TO A TAX INCREMENT FINANCING MECHANISM TO FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THOSE ARE SOME THAT'S ANOTHER LAW I THINK THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE BUILT ON IN THE FUTURE. HOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF OTHER THERE'S A SEAPORT AND MILITARY I INFRASTRUCTURE LOS WELL? WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. TOOLS I I WANT TO POINT OUT THERE SOME OTHER TOOLS OUT THERE IN THE LAW. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA COMPETES A IT'S A THROUGH GOBIZ THERE'S A NUMBER OF TAX CREDITS ALLOCATED ON VIA COMMUTE OUT STATE PROGRAM. THAT THERE WAS. THE ENTERPRISE ZONE PROGRAM WHICH ALSO USED TO EXIST WAS STATE APPROVED FORTY TWO SOUNDS TARGETED TOWARD TRYING TO. TO GET JOBS INTO A COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF UNEMPLOYMENT OF THAT THAT PROGRAM NO LONGER EXISTS THE HIRING TAX CREDIT WHICH. SORT OF REPLACED IT HAS BEEN REALLY UNDER UTILIZE I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME IMPROVEMENTS THERE THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER. CREDITS. MISTER. OR OUT NOW SENATOR DODD AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER CARRIED A BILL A. B.. IT NO SIX COUPLE YEARS AGO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO EXISTING CITIES AND COUNTIES IN TERMS OF OF OF DOING SOME ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT MOVES FORWARD. HARM IT IS SO I KNOW THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WELL OKAY WE'VE GOT ALL THESE TOOLS AND AND. OKAY OR SOME EXAMPLES OF WHERE CITIES HAVE BEGUN TO USE SOME. Y. THE USE THE MORE. THERE IS SET THIS UP THE LOSS TO REDEVELOP WAS PRETTY TOUGH ON OUR CITIES ARE WE LOST MOST OF OUR. EXPERTS ON COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THERE'S NOT A LOT PEOPLE LEFT IN IN CITY HALL THAT KNOW HOW TO DO SOME OF THIS STUFF BECAUSE IT'S IT'S COMPLICATED. ARM A LOT OF THE STAFF WE HAD LEFT WERE FOCUSED FOR ABOUT A FIVE YEAR BATTLE WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TRYING TO HANG ON TO DIFFERENT. THINGS THAT WERE IMPORTANT IN THEIR COMMUNITY OF LITIGATION ALL SORTS OF THINGS AREN'T SO A LOT OF THESE. WHO HOPE A LOT OF CITY OFFICIALS REALLY HAVEN'T HAD MUCH MET MUCH BAN WITH TRULY FOCUS ON THESE NEW TOOLS? NOW THAT THE SORT OF THE DUST IS SETTLING FROM THE RDA PROCESS I THINK YOU'LL SEE MORE COMMUNITIES LOOKING AT IT. AND THEN I DID MENTIONS SOME TRUST ISSUES ARE YOU KNOW THESE THESE ARE TOOLS ARE REALLY LOOKING AT MAYBE ARE A FORTY FIVE YEAR INVESTMENT AND AND IF THE CITY'S GONNA PUT ITS RESOURCES INTO SOMETHING FOR THE LONG HAUL. BUT THEY REALLY DON'T WANT THE RULES CHANGED ON AND. A LOT BECAUSE IT JUST IT IT WAS SO I THINK AS WE WORK ON THIS I THINK UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THERE HAS TO BE A LITTLE MORE. WE'RE MORE OF A PARTNERSHIP THAT THAT IF YOU EMBARK IN INTRO TO USE ONE OF THESE TOOLS THAT THE RULES ARE GONNA BE RADICALLY CHANGED ON YOU. HALFWAY INTO THAT PROCESS OR OTHER THINGS GOING ON WITH CITIES ARM OR THERE'S THAT WHILE THE STATE BUDGET IS DOING BETTER THAN A LOT OF OUR CITIES OUR TIMES ARE NOT SO GOOD. ON A LOT OF OUR CITIES HAVEN'T REALLY REBOUNDED IN TERMS OF STAFFING SINCE THE RECESSION THEY REALLY HAVEN'T REFILL THOSE JOBS. YOU'VE ALL READ ABOUT SOME OF THE PENSION. CHALLENGES OF MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FACING. THAT'S KINDA TIGHTENING UP ON ON A ON A FLEXIBILITY OF EXISTING REVENUE. SALES TAX. DIFFERENT CHANGES INTERNET ECONOMY MARKET CHANGES OR OR KIND OF CHANGING WHERE THOSE DOLLARS GO. PROPERTY TAX REALLY HASN'T REBOUNDED ARE IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES I WAS WORKING WITH ON. AS A ANALYSTS FROM C. SOCK ON A PRESENTATION WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE LATER THIS WEEK. THEY HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM C. SECOND SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF COUNTIES THE PROPERTY TAX REALLY HASN'T REBOUNDED SENSE THAT THAT THE HEIGHTS OF OF OF. THE THE PRIOR ON A IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SO WELLS IN SOME COUNTIES IN SOME AREAS THE STATE ECONOMY IS GOING REALLY WELL THAT DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK TO A LOT OF OTHER SITUATIONS GOING ON. A IN THE STATE THERE'S A COUPLE OF. BALLOT MEASURES OUT OUTSIDE OF THIS BUILDING THAT IF THEY WENT THROUGH CAN EVEN LIMIT OUR ABILITY. ARE EVEN MORE. THE OTHER THING GOING ON WITH WITH CITIES WHEN LOOK AT THESE TOOLS IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF. OF WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF THE SALES ARE A PART OF THE THE PROPERTY TAX THAT THE ARMED COMMUNITY GETS THERE'S A LOT OF CITIES MAY GET FIVE TEN PERCENT FIFTEEN PERCENT. SO IF THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU ALL VERY LONG TIME BEFORE YOU OFTEN OF FINANCIAL LIFT TO GET ANYTHING DONE SO. OTHER YOU KNOW IT IT IN LESS YOU CAN REALLY PARTNER WITH ANOTHER ENTITY. THAT'S ALSO A A DETERRENT. AND SAW IT IN THE END I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY HEAR FROM SOME OF THE COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS A LITTLE BIT LATER THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN MISSIONS THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CHALLENGES AND OBLIGATIONS. AND AND THEY'RE GONNA BE CAREFUL AT AS TO WHAT THE INVEST IN IT IT IN WHEN IT COMES TO I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A DIFFERENCE WE'RE GONNA SEE BETWEEN. THE I F. DE WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO CUT IT AS I SAID THE WHERE DOES IT REALLY MATTER ITS POLITICAL AGREEMENT IT COULD BE ONE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE OR SOMETHING MORE COMPLEX. I SEE MAYBE MORE PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES BETWEEN CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS ON ON SOME E. I. F. DE INFRASTRUCTURE TYPE THINGS. IT'S HARDER FOR ME TO SEE. COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. YEAH IT WOULD YOU KNOW WORKING ON FIXING DOWNTOWN I MEAN THAT THAT WAS THE TRADITIONAL REDEVELOPMENT. ARM. WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD THERE'S A? WITH ANY OF THESE NEW TOOLS YOU NOW HAVE TO USE SEE IF YOU CAN FIND COMMON GROUND WITH THE COUNTY SEE IF YOU CAN FIND. COMMON GROUND WITH SPECIAL DISTRICT. I THINK WE'RE GOING FORWARD WE LIKE TO SEE WHERE WE COULD FIND COMMON GROUND WITH THE STATE. AND WHAT ARE THOSE AREAS THAT THAT WE THINK THERE'S COMMON GROUND BETWEEN CITIES AND WHAT WE DO AS SORT OF THE URBAN CORES OF THE STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DISADVANTAGED AREAS TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT CARBON REDUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN ALSO SCHOOLS BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ON A SMART GROWTH INFILL DEVELOPMENT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S ALWAYS WAS FORGOTTEN EVEN IN THE OLD REDEVELOPMENT TOOL WAS THE QUALITY OF SCHOOLS BUT THEY WERE KIND OF IN A DIFFERENT SILO. SO IS I THINK AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THESE NEW TOOLS IS MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING A HAVING A REALLY GOOD QUALITY SCHOOL IS GOING TO BE A KEY TO KIND OF AN INFILL STRATEGY BECAUSE. IT REALLY BECOMES A MAGNET TO. TO TEQUILA TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN. INDIVIDUALS TO AND FAMILIES TO LIVE IN THOSE AREAS SO THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS I THINK YOU'VE GOT A NUMBER OF REALLY GOOD THINGS. THAT THAT ARE OUT THERE THEY CAN BE IMPROVED THESE TOLLS KOREA YA THEY CAN BE IMPROVED. BUT LOOK LOOK FOR WAYS TO CONDUCT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HELP TO HAVE A BRAND NEW TOOL YOU CAN BUILD OFF SOME OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. ON THE OTHER THING IS THE GAME CHANGER IN IS GOING TO BE. WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE IS WILLING TO OPEN UP. A DISCUSSION OF ACCESSING THE SCHOOL SHARE ALL ON PROJECTS WHERE THEY WILL WHERE THERE'S COMMON GROUND IF IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT OF ITS TOT PROJECT OF ITS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHERE THE AREAS OF COMMON GROUND. THE LET JUSTICE WE TALK AND TALK TO A COUNTY AND THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS OR THE SPECIAL DISTRICT BOARD CAN MAKE UP THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE AND WHETHER AND INVESTMENT IS WORTH IT WOULD LIKE TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH. SOME ENTITY AT THE STATE LEVEL STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL IBEC SOME ENTITY WHERE IT WAS UNDER SOME PARAMETERS WE CAN MAYBE GET BACK TO SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE OLD A CONCENTRATED FINANCIAL LEFT. BEGIN WHAT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT IT'S GONNA BE ON SOMETHING WE ALL AGREE ON RATHER THAN THIS ARE WE DO SOMETHING AND PEOPLE CAN DEBATE WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD. THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU AT MISS KERRIGAN I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THAT THE SUMMARY. I'VE A QUESTION REALLY MORE TO THE OTHER PANELISTS BUT. THERE WAS ONCE THE ONE THING I JUST WANT TO MENTION FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. FOR E. IFT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY A HANDFUL OF CITIES HAVE ACTUALLY FORM THESE IN. THE CITY'S UNAWARE OF OUR WEST SACRAMENTO LAVERNE AND SAN DIEGO AND THEN FOR CREA. SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN NO CITIES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THAT. AND THEN THE OTHER TWO LAWS AJ'S IN THE FIFTIES. THEY WERE BOTH OF FOR LAST YEAR'S SO THAT THE JURY IS STILL OUT. ARM I KNOW DAN YOU YOU LAID OUT SO THE REASONS WHY THIS HASN'T HAPPENED BUT I WOULD LOVE. AND LET'S SEE IF ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD HERE WITH THE OTHER PANELISTS JUST WHAT YOU THINK ARE THE BARRIERS FOR WHY THIS HASN'T HAPPENED I HAVE WONDERED FOR EXAMPLE IF THE. THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE SET UP ARE TOO COMPLICATED. IF THE LACK OF THE SCHOOL SHARE HOW MUCH WHAT IMPACT THAT HAS HAD. I HAD NOT HEARD THE THE THE ISSUE OF OF STAFFING AND SORT TECHNICAL EXPERTISE BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT MUST BE AN ISSUE BUT. JUST LOVE TO UNDERSTAND MORE WHAT HAS BEEN. WHAT IS BEEN THE REASON WHY THESE POSTS REDEVELOPMENT TOOLS HAVE NOT REALLY SEEN THAT THE PICKUP AND I KNOW DAD YOU SPENT? ABOUT SOME GOOD TIME EXPLAINING THAT BUT BUT WHAT I'M REALLY FOR CERTAINLY WANT ONE QUICK RESPONSE ARE I MEAN. BUT PART OF IT IS ALL THE THINGS I SAID. BUT. I DO THINK THAT THOUGH THE SCHOOL SHARE IS IS IS A KEY INGREDIENT. AND ARM I REALLY THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE THAT THE GAME CHANGER IN IN TERMS OF GETTING INTO SOME OF THESE TOOLS ALL THE OTHER THING IS. IT TAKES AWHILE IF IF IT IS A CITY IS EXPECTED TO GO TALK TO THE COUNTY. TALK TO A SPECIAL DISTRICT TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S AGREEMENT THAT CAN TAKE A WHILE TALK TO YOUR COMMUNITY SO SO EVEN THOSE WHAT THESE LAWS ARE YOU KNOW MAYBE A COUPLE YEARS OLD. THAT PROCESS THE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S COMMON GROUND TAKES A WHILE THERE'S A LOT WELL THERE'S TWO OR THREE MAYBE FORMED THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS UNDER EXPLORATION BUT BUT I DO THINK IT WILL TAKE AWHILE. ARE EVEN FOR EVEN IF ALL IT EVEN IF THE WILL WAS THERE BECAUSE I I THINK THIS REQUIRES MORE UP FRONT COOPERATIVE DISCUSSIONS THAT MAYBE OTHER TOOL WHICH YOU JUST FOLLOWED A STATUTE. AND ONE SUMMER THAT WOULD BE GREAT AT SOME POINT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TODAY I'D LOVE TO SEE IF YOU KNOW. WHAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE ENGAGING AYE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS SUCH THAT IN A FEW YEARS MAYBE OTHERS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FOUGHT YEAH I HAVE TO EASE OUR CREUS? SO WE AYE. SERVED IT JUST A GENERAL QUESTION AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PANEL. SO NEXT SAW WELCOME ERIC CALDWELL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING HE'S THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR FROM THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND WILL THAT YOU GET STARTED RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. ARE. A LOT OF MY COMMENTS ARE GONNA ACCO VERY CLOSELY THAT THE COMMENTS THAT. DAN JUST MADE AS IT RELATES TO. MOST SPECIFICALLY THE EF I D. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION AND SEEN DIEGO WHY WE CHOSE TO USE IT. WHY WE'VE CHOSEN TO USE IT AND JUST ONE SPECIFIC AREA AND OF COURSE I AM HAPPY TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE ISSUES? RELATED TO CREATE AS WELL I THINK WOULD DAM DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF SUMMARIZING IS THAT WITH THE LANDSCAPE IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POSED DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT. AFTER WE. COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS WHAT THROUGH THE STAGES OF GRIEF WHAT THE END OF REDEVELOPMENT IT REALLY FORCED US TO BE MORE CREATIVE. AND MORE DELIBERATE AND TO WHAT I LIKE TO CALL STACK DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND TOOLS WAS NO LONGER ONE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT WE COULD GO TO. AND TIME AFTER TIME AGAIN USE IT AS A MULTI TOOL TO SOLVE A WIDE ARRAY OF PROBLEMS NOW REQUIRES YOU TO LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. AND THEN LATER MULTIPLE TOOLS THAT THE STATE PROVIDES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES IN LEVERAGING OUR CBG DOLLARS AND LOOKING AT. HOW WE LEVERAGE JE LOCAL INCENTIVES MANY JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO HAVE CREATED NEW INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND LOAN PROGRAMS ALL FOCUSED ON CREW REBUILDING THE ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOOL BOX? INTO SOMETHING THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND USEFUL. AS IT RELATES TO OUR E. FID IMPLEMENTATION AND WE CREATED OUR YOU HAVE ID AND JULY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE EXPECT THE FIRST TEE I TAX INCREMENT DOLLARS TO FLOW INTO THE CITY. IN JULY OF THIS YEAR WERE EXPECTING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THAT RAMP UP TO ABOUT FIVE MILLION. WE ARE USING IF ID'S AND WERE ACTUALLY VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS TOOL. BUT WE'RE USING IT AS A AYE I ACTUALLY WROTE THIS DOWN. WOULD DAM CALLED STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OR SURGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND THAT'S VERY MUCH OF THE WAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. SO FOR US THERE'S A COMMUNITY ALL TIME MESA IN SAN DIEGO. JUST RIGHT ALONG THE BORDER LARGE AMOUNT OF UNDER DEVELOPED INDUSTRIAL LAND. WE TOOK FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN ACRES OF THAT LAND AND PUT IT INTO A E. F. I. D.. AND WERE ESSENTIALLY FUNDING PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL MAKE THAT COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE IN WHICH TO LIVE BETTER PLACE IN WHICH AND VAST. BUT IT'S ALL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IT'S I WOULD SAY THE DEEP. PRINCIPLE CHALLENGE FOR US WOULD BE FID. AND WHY IT WORKED IN THAT LOCATION BUT NOT AND OTHER PLACES IN THE CITIES BECAUSE THE CITY. HAD A VESTED INTEREST IN MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ANYWAY. IBF IDEAS A TOOL THAT ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS US TO TAKE OUR OWN REVENUES THAT ARE COMING IN. AND SIPHON THEM OFF PUT THEM INTO A BOX THAT CANNOT BE TOUCHED. AS THE CITY AND ENCOUNTERS ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE SO THAT IS DEDICATED TOWARDS SCHOOLS THOSE. PROBLEMS THAT. WE LAID OUT IN THE FORMATION. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. IN THE FORMATION OF OUR IF ID WE DID HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY. IN TRYING TO GET THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE AND EVEN EXPAND THE BORDERS OF THE DISTRICT INTO THE UNINCORPORATED AREA WHICH BORDERS THE AREA. AND OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL I THINK THAT THAT IS A DEFINITIVELY APPOINT AS THE ASSEMBLY. THINKS ABOUT HOW TO REFORM THIS TOOL. AND DANCE COMMENTS WERE I THINK SPOT ON IN THE SENSE THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN AGREE I AM AND PRIORITIES THAT MAYBE REGIONAL IN NATURE STATEWIDE IN NATURE. AND HOW OF THE. BOTH MUNICIPALITIES AS WELL AS COUNTIES AND THE STATE ALL AGREED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SHARING OF REVENUE. AND ORDERED THERE'S IT LEAST MORE OF AN INCENTIVE. I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT IF THE ROLES WERE BEEN REVERSED AND THE COUNTY CAME TO US AND SAID WE WANT TO FOR MANY IF ID AND WE WANT SOME OF THE CITY'S REVENUE. FOR OUR PRIORITIES THAT ARE ANSWER WOULD HAVE BEEN YES. AND. JURISDICTIONS ARE LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR THEIR OWN INTERESTS INTERESTS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN THEIR BUSINESSES. BUT I CAN TELL YOU IF THERE WAS AN INCENTIVE FOR US TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WHERE WE COULD SAY LET'S THINK REGIONALLY LET'S THINK ABOUT. MAYBE WHAT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS OR. BRINGING IN A LARGE EMPLOYER AND BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THAT EMPLOYER NEEDS OR COMPLETING ROADS AND AND SORT OF LIKE WE ARE AND AN ALL TIME MESA WITH THAT WOULD HAVE ON OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE DISTRICT. I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A HELPFUL THING TO. TO CONTEMPLATE. I WOULD SAY. WHEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT DOESN'T WORK. HAVE NOT HAVING ANY IF ID DOESN'T WORK WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER INSTANCES OF POTENTIALLY HOW TO USE THIS IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. WE HAVE MAJOR EMPLOYERS THAT I I WON'T NAME ENDS AND RIGHT NOW BUT. THAT HAVE LOOKED AT COULD THEY USE THIS ON THEIR CAMPUS TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE TRAFFIC ISSUES THAT. THEIR EMPLOYEES MAY BE AND ENCOUNTERING AS I GET OFF THE FREEWAY AND AND AND TRY TO GET TO WORK. IT'S NOT A ONE STOP TOOL I THINK WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT. STACKING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS THE ASSEMBLY CREATES NEW TOOLS REFINES TOOLS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS DAN MENTIONED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TOOLS ARE WORKING. IN CONCERT WITH EACH OTHER THAT CITIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAILOR THEIR TOOLS. AND LEVERAGE FEDERL DOLLARS TO WORK IN CONCERT WITH THESE TOOLS. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT DOES WORK WITH THE F. ID IS THAT. THIS IS DEFINITELY A TOOL THAT GIVES WHAT I CALL SUB LOCAL CONTROL. IT IS GIVING AN EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES WERE SMALLER PORTIONS WITHIN A COMMUNITY. IT LEAST IN THE IN SAN DIEGO'S IMPLEMENTATION INSTANCE THE ABILITY TO SET A PATH WHERE CERTAIN PROJECTS HAVE A DEFINITIVE SOURCE OF FUNDING. INTO THE FUTURE REGARDLESS OF HOW POLITICS MAY CHANGE REGARDLESS OF HOW PRIORITIES CHANGE IT GIVES US A MECHANISM TO LOCK BOX THAT IN. I WOULD SAY GOOD. IN IN CLOSING. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE F. ID AGAIN IT IS A VERY SPECIAL SURGICAL TOOL. IT IS A GOOD TOOL I THINK. GIVING INCENTIVES TO MUNICIPALITIES IN THE COUNTY AND OPENING THE DOOR FOR A CONVERSATION WITH THE STATE IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD GREATLY ALLOWS TO USE THAT TOOL EVEN MORE. WHEN. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CREE IRON Y. THE CITY HAS AND USE CREA THAT WAS A TOOL THAT WE WE DID AN EXTENSIVE STUDY IN THE LATTER PART OF LAST YEAR. LOOKING AT POTENTIAL USING THAT TOOL NOTS MEDLEY IT IT. WAS AN ISSUE OF. TAKING FUNDS JUST CITY FUNDS AND. PRESUMING THAT WE COULDN'T GET TO AN AGREEMENT WHAT ARE COUNTY IT WOULD JUST LOCK BOX ARE FUNDS AND IN THAT CASE YOU HAVE A MORE COMPLEX GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE. THAT ESSENTIALLY WOULD BE TAKING CITY FUNDS FOR CITY PRIORITIES AND TURNING THEM OVER TO A GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE THAT IS LARGELY OUT OF OUR CONTROL. SO IN CLOSING I. HAPPY TO ANSWER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS HAPPY TO BE HERE AND ENTHUSIASTIC THAT THE COMMITTEE IS HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU. FIVE A QUICK QUESTION. MISTER PROBLEM. SO A WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD YOU GIVE TO UMB OTHER CITIES THAT ARE LOOKING IN FORMING IN THE F. ID. AND. HAVE ANY OF THEM REACHED OUT FOR GUIDANCE. WE HAVE HADOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH A HANDFUL OF CITIES THAT HAVE LOOKED AT YOU HAVE ID AND KOREA. ARE GENERAL GUIDANCE TO JURISDICTIONS ARE ARE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS. ARE. HOW IT VERY VERY EARLY ON HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR? WITH YOUR COUNTY. AND SEE IF YOU CAN'T BRING THEM TO THE TABLE I WILL SAY THAT THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO DID SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE THERE WERE EXTENSIVE. CONVERSATIONS ARE TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE OR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND POLICYMAKERS IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS VERY EARLY ON I THINK IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT'S ADVANTAGEOUS TO DO. BUT. YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN BUILD THE CONCEPT WITH ANOTHER JURISDICTION AND PARTNER WITH THEM THE TOOL IS GOING TO BE MORE POWERFUL. I WILL SAY A AND IN CONTRAST TO CREA THERE ARE INSTANCES. TIME MESA BEING WORN AND AND POTENTIALLY OTHERS IN THE CITY WHERE EVEN WITHOUT USING ANOTHER JURISDICTIONS FUNDING. AND IF AIDID DOES MAKE SENSE SO FINDING THOSE USE CASES REALLY ENGAGING CONSULTANTS TO HELP YOU LOOK AT WATER WHAT'S THE LONG TERM GOVERNMENTS. LOOK LIKE FOR THE DISTRICT HOW MUCH TAX INCREMENT ARE YOU GOING TO BRING IN. AND THEN REALLY ASKING YOURSELF AGAIN BECAUSE MANY OF THESE. ATTRIBUTES OF ANY OF ID AND TO SOME EXTENT CREA YOU CAN ALREADY DO USING EXISTING LOCAL AUTHORITIES IS THIS REALLY THE RIGHT TOOL FOR YOU. THANK YOU. FOR. MISTER GLORIA NOW BUT COMMENTS. DATE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND YOU MY MAGIC I WAS AND WHAT THE SETTING GET BY WITHOUT IT CHATTING AND I I OF THE CITY. OUR CHAIRWOMAN OF ASKED THE QUESTION THAT I WAS INTERESTED NASCENT MISTER KALRA BUT WANTED JUST COMMENCE MY COLLEAGUES A BECAUSE IT. MAZING PART OF THE CITY TEAM DOWN THERE AND IS DEATHLY GREAT RESOURCE FOR LUCKY TO HAVE A MEANS HAD EXPERIENCE IN THE BUSINESS. IN THE BUILDING. AS WELL AS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND I KNOW JUST ATHLETES ALL PLAYERS HAVE YOU TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY PLEASE THINK THEY'RE FAULKNER. TO A YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT I'M GETTING FROM BOTH YOUR PRESENTATION FROM BANDS IS THAT. AT ALL TO SUBMIT MY MY BIAS MAYBE I'M TOO OLD SCHOOL AND THINK THAT RDA WAS EVERYTHING THERE WAS REMEMBER THOSE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN I'M HEARING IS THE US IN THESE OTHER TOOLS ARE AS INEFFECTIVE. AS I THOUGHT THEM TO BE IN GIVE ME THAT'S MY OWN PERSONAL BIAS HAVING REMEMBERED WHAT IT IS TO HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAX INCREMENT. BY TAKING AWAY THAT MAYBE THIS IS BETTER AND PERHAPS. THE LACK OF WHAT I SEE IS ACTUAL RESULTS IS PRACTICE THESE ARE STILL IN THEIR INFANCY IS THAT A FAIR TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR COMMENTS. I WOULD SAY. JUST TO GREAT EXTENT YES WE ARE STILL FIGURING OUT HOW THESE TOOLS WORK WHERE THEY WORK PASSED. ANY DAN AS AS. I THINK EVERYONE LOOKED AT REDEVELOPMENT AS IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOOL CHEST. IT WAS THE POWER SAW YOU KNOW THAT COULD CUT THROUGH ANYTHING. AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEFT WORK SINCE THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT ARE SOME REALLY FINE HAND TOOLS. YOU CAN STILL ACCOMPLISH IT BUT NOW YOU MIGHT NEED TO USE TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR EXAMPLE ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I WOULD WE'D JANET MENTIONED IN HIS PRESENTATION THAT ASSEMBLAGE YOU KNOW USING EMINENT DOMAIN ASSEMBLING PROPERTIES BEING ABLE TO SIT ON THOSE PROPERTIES WHILE YOU. YOU ASSEMBLE ADDITIONAL PARCELS AND THEN BRING IT TOGETHER AND OFFER IT TO A ULTIMATELY BILL THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH SOME DEGREE OF DISCOUNT OR FAVORABLE TERMS? IT YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THAT UNDER ANY IF ID YOU CAN BUILDING UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE YOU CAN. WORK ON AN EXISTING PROJECT WHEN I TALK TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TODAY ASSEMBLAGES THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE. THAT THEY'RE FACING IN SAN DIEGO. I LOVE THE ANALOGY SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING. CONVERTED TO THAT FAIRLY QUICKLY ARM MAYBE JUST A FOLLOW UP IN AND I REALIZE THIS MAY NOT BE AS A BENEFICIAL TO MY COLLEAGUES ARE GOING UP HIS FAVOR A FAMILIAR WITH A TEN MESA OTHER AFTER YESTERDAY PUBLIC ARE FAIRLY WELL FAMILIAR AT THIS POINT. DIFFICULT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT. AIR KEY TALK ABOUT WHAT'S BEING BUILT WITH THIS WAS NO THAT WAS ABOUT THE TRUMP BORDER WALL THING INSIDE OUT. INSIDE JOKE COMEDY ROUTINE. ERIC KNOWS THIS YET EIGHT YEARS OF IT WITH ME AT. ALL GITA WHICH A BUILDING DOWN AND I GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE EF ID ON ATTENDANCE. SO THIS WAS AN AREA THAT HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDER INVESTED AS IT RELATES TO CITY INFRASTRUCTURE SO LOOKING AT OUR PUBLIC FACILITIES FINANCING PLAN. FOR THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT YOU HAVE IDEAS FINANCING SO NO LONGER WILL WE BE ABLE TO NOT FINANCE THOSE THINGS WE HAVE A DEDICATED REVENUE SOURCE. TO BUILD ROADS AND SEWERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AREN'T CHEAP TO YOUR POINT THIS AREA BEING ALONG THE US MEXICO BORDER. IT IS FIVE HUNDRED TEN ACRES OF SOME OF THE. LAST REMAINING PARCELS WHERE YOU CAN BILLS INDUSTRIAL IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. AND SOME OF IT IS RAW LAND A LOT OF IT IS VACANT. SOME OF IT WAS JUST RECENTLY ZONE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME SO BUILDING UP TO SEWER IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOMETHING THAT IS GREATLY NEEDED. AND THAT'S PRINCIPLE REASON THESE FUNDS FOR LIVE SUPER HELPFUL BECAUSE AND I THINK IT AND GET IN THE OLD DAYS ON PROJECT AREA YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT PROJECT WHAT PARK WHATEVER YOU TRY TO BUILD. MYSTIFICATION BILLION UP OF FACILITIES. PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT IN MEMORY SERVES YOU COULDN'T THERE CERTAIN ROADS WE COULDN'T COMPLETE THERE'S A LOT OF DRAINAGE AND OTHER ISSUES THAT RIGHT THAT WERE BARRIERS TO PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT SO. THAT A IF ID DELIVERS HIS INFRASTRUCTURE THING YOUR HOPE IS THAT BECAUSE OF THIS PRIME LOCATION IN ITS IN ITS POTENTIAL USE THAT TO GET THE PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT THAT'S WORTHY OF THE STATE OF THAT. THE COMMUNITIES INVESTMENT IN THIS DISTRICT CRAP. BOB WELL AGAIN I WOULD JUST MENTION TO BOTH MY COLLEAGUES TO CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE I MEAN THEY'RE A MISSED CALL IS A WONDERFUL RESOURCE THANK YOU FOR TRAVELING UP HERE. I THINK I I IT'S IT'S IT'S HELPFUL HERE AGAIN OF THIS MAY BE MORE USEFUL THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS. I HAVE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION AND I'M JUST. WONDERFULLY FIXATED ON YOUR EXAMPLE OF THE POWER TOOL A NEVER HEARD. EFTS DESCRIBED THAT WAY ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I'VE HEARD AS TO WHY IT HASN'T BEEN MORE WIDELY USED IS IS JUST NOT ENOUGH INCREMENT ORDER PUT USING ALGAE. IT'S ONE POWER TOOL TO TRY TO BUILD THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF HOUSING IS JUST NOT ENOUGH. WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT. INSIEME DIEGO'S. EXAMPLE. AND AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHEN YOU LAUNCH IT IN WHERE YOU'RE ESTABLISHING THAT BASE YEAR BUT THAT WAS AN ISSUE AS WE'VE LOOKED AT YOU HAVE ID IMPLEMENTATION OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY. SPEND EVEN MORE OF AN ISSUE AS WE LOOKED AT CREE UP. AND WE DID OUR ANALYSIS OF EVERY. CENSUS TRACT THAT WE COULD PUT INTO A CREA AND ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT WE CAME UP WITH USING BIDS JUST OUR OWN DOLLARS IN TERMS OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. AT IT IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH NEW INCREMENTAL JUSTIFY THE CREATION OF THE ENTITY. GREAT THANK YOU THAT SAID THAT'S FOR HELP AGAIN EDGE OF HER COLLEAGUES THE FACT THAT. NOT A SINGLE CITY HAS FORMED A CREA SINCE IT WAS. STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I THINK IS A. BIT OF A FLAG ALTHOUGH AGAIN IF YOU WERE IF IF THE PANELS AWARE OF CITIES THAT ARE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING. CREATORE I'VE HE'S BE HELPFUL FOR US TO KNOW THAT I KNOW WHAT'S AGO WAS LOOKING AT IT AND I BELIEVE SALINAS WAS LOOKING AT IT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW BUT I AGAIN I THINK WHEN YOU IT IT GETS. SOME OF THE ANALYSIS COMES BACK TO THE FINANCIAL LEFT ISSUE AND AND. IT AND I AYE ON THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER TAXI ENTITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS I MEAN. IT ISN'T IT. S. STARKLY THERE NEVER WERE SUCH CONVERSATIONS SO THIS IS A BRAND NEW CONVERSATION THAT'S BEING OUT AND REMEMBER WE'RE JUST FINISHING UP THE REDEVELOPMENT PROCESS WHICH WAS PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL AND THERE'S A LOT ATTENTION SO. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BUILD A BIT MORE BREATHING ROOM AT MAYBE IN THE FUTURE A COUNTIES AND AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS MARTZ MIGHT START SEEING OPPORTUNITIES THAT. BUT SOME IT IT I THINK WITH ALL THESE TOOLS I THINK IT'S A LITTLE EARLY THAT THEY'RE THAT DID TAKES AWHILE TO TO SET THESE UP IN AND GET THE BY AND. ONE LAST QUESTION FOR HIS FATHER I'M WHAT OTHER TOOLS ARE YOU LOOKING AT YOU SAID BEING STACKED. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT A LOT OF NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE CREATING IN LOW TO MODERATE INCOME CENSUS TRACKS USING CBG HISTORICALLY THE CITY HAS NOT. UTILIZE CVG FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. AND. ESSENTIALLY WHAT WERE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO BUSINESSES OR DEVELOPMENTS WERE HAVING SPECIFIC CONVERSATIONS WITH DEVELOPERS AND BUSINESSES AND ASKING ABOUT. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE GAP AND AND HOW DO WE CLOSE THAT GAP. SO ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT CAN WE USE CFD LAW. POTENTIALLY. PAY FOR SOME OF THE ASSEMBLAGE WHERE WERE ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE PACE FINANCING AND EXPLORE AND. USING OUR CHARTER AUTHORITY AS A CITY CAN WE. ALLOW FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY FINANCE IT USING A. CFD BELARUS TYPES STRUCTURE AND THEN AS SOON AS THAT PROJECT IS COMPLETED IT'S USUALLY SOLD OFF TO TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND AT THAT TIME THAN THAT THAT SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS CLEARED. SO IT'S IT'S LOOKING A LOT OF KIND OF. I WOULD SAY MORE INNOVATIVE AND REALLY IF THERE WAS ANY GOOD THAT CAME OUT OF THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT. ARM FROM MY PROFESSIONS PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS IT IT'S REALLY REQUIRED US TO GET CREATIVE AND AND THINK ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO LOCALLY. TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS AND BE SPECIFIC FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO WILL MOVE ON TO. MICHAEL LANE POLICY DIRECTOR NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION CAL AMONG THE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE. DID YOU CAN TELL THIS IS QUITE THE SUBJECT TORRENT NO PROBLEM THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND LIKE TO SPEAK TO. TIFF TOOLS IF YOU WILL FROM THE PERSPECTIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN PARTICULAR CAN ANSWER SOME YOUR QUESTIONS AS WE GO ALONG BECAUSE I WAS ALL. IN MY PREPARED REMARKS ANYWAY BUT JUST WANNA GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS WHAT WE SEE IN THE FIELD WILL BE THANKS WE. THINK WORKS IN GIVING UP IN THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE LEGISLATURE. WITH THE LEAGUE AND WITH OTHERS TO TRY THAT REALLY ENHANCE SOME OF THESE TOLD RICHARD ABOUT TO MAKE THEM AS. AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE PARTICULAR BAYER REGION WHICH WE REPRESENT. WHICH HAS SOME DIFFERENT KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS. PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF HOUSING. JOBS KINDS A GAPS WERE SEEN AND THEN PATTERNS OF RESEGREGATION EMERGING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND GENTRIFYING AREAS AND SO. DOES THE KIND OF THE PERSPECTIVE THAT WILL TAKE ON THE SCHOOL IS MOSTLY FIRST OF ALL TALK ABOUT THE I FD LET THANK. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WERE CERTAINLY PLEASED IF THE ADMINISTRATION CAME BACK TO TABLE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO WAS THE GOOD NEWS THE BAD NEWS IS WE WERE NEVER SURE THAT THE I FD KIND OF. PLACE IN IN IN THE CODE WAS THE PLACE TO GO TOOK THAT ON. IFT IS REALLY WERE FOR SORTS OF PUBLIC WORKS PRO USE CALL PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS FLOOD CONTROL PROJECTS FOR YOU WOULD ASSESS PROPERTY OWNERS. WHO ALL HAD A KIND OF A A BENEFIT THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING FROM THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT? AND WAS A TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT SARTRE AND WE TRY TO TO BROADEN THAT A BIT UNIT UP WITH AN ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING JUST COMING UP YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THAT EFFORT. BUT IT DOES REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL AND SO YOU REALLY NEED LARGE. AREAS OF LAND WE HAVE ELEVEN REGISTERED VOTERS ARE FEWER. AND WE HAD ONE LANDOWNER AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN A LOT OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT OVER TIME TO REALLY BE ABLE TO PAY OFF THOSE THOSE BONDS THAT YOU DO ISSUE SO THAT. THE BOTTOM LINE FOR US IT'S IT'S LONG ONE PROCESS IN SHORT ON REVENUES THAT YOU'RE GENERATING IN MOST AREAS WHERE DOES WORK IN PARTICULAR I THINK IS A MILITARY REUSE KINDS OF A PLAN. WE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LARGE OPEN SPACE WITH ONE LANDOWNER HAVE POTENTIALLY LOTS OF VERY. LUCRATIVE INVESTMENT COMING IN PARTICULAR THAT YOU CAN THEN FUND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE KNOWING OVER TIME THAT TAX INCREMENT IS GOING TO BE GENERATED. BUT THERE WAS NO LO LO MAS SET ASIDE EVEN IN THE I FD BELIEVE IT OR NOT AMAZINGLY ENOUGH AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT. AND SO IT WAS BASICALLY OPTIONAL YOU COULD DO IT OR NOT SO WE'RE VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT IS THE I FD AS A TOOL. AND SO THEN WE LOOKED AT THE CREATES AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT DAN AND OTHERS IN THE CBA. DID WITH WITH FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER LUIS ALEJO WAS IT WAS REALLY GOOD WORK ON THE GROUND NAY KIND OF GRIND IT OUT. I DID A YEOMAN'S JOB ON GETTING HIS CREOSOTE UP THE LIMITS OF THE CREE AS THOUGH. AND I DON'T OF DEAD MENTION THIS OR NOT BUT THERE REALLY TARGET DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH INDICES OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND CRIME STATISTICS. AND SO MANY PARTS OF OUR STATE REALLY CAN'T BENEFIT FROM THEM BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THEY TOOK THE LEAD TO BUILD A TOOL AND WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION SEE WHAT THE GOVERNOR WAS WILLING TO SIGN. AND WE THINK THAT WAS REALLY VALUABLE WORKS THAT'S WHY WE CAME BACK THE NEXT YEAR WITH AB FIFTEEN NINETY ABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN. TO DO THESE HOUSING AUTHORITIES WHICH EXPLICITLY BUILT ON THE CREATE CONCEPT BUT THERE REALLY TARGETED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT LARGER KIND OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANS THAT THE CITY'S HABIT SEPARATELY ALSO A TREMENDOUS NEEDS THERE. AND A LOT OF THOSE THOSE COST BURDENS GET SHIFTED TO NEW DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO FUND THESE KIND A MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT CITIES NEED TO UNDERTAKE THAT'S BEEN EXACERBATED BY. THE SLASHING OF OF THE HOME IN CBG FUNDS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT'S WHY EVEN MORE THAN EVER. WE TO STRONG STATE PARTNER TO STEPIN AND HELP US TO DO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THE FEDS ARE NOT HERE TO HELP AND QUITE FRANKLY IT'S GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOU KNOW EXPECT. EVEN DEEPER CUTS TO TEHAMA CITY BG IN TERMS OF OF THOSE KEY TOOLS ANDFINANCING FOR FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOUSING. LOCALLY THOUGH SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE HAD THAT THE WILL POLITICAL WILL TO STEP UP PROGRESSIVE JURISDICTIONS TO DO THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE TAX. AND VOTERS HAVE ACTUALLY VOTED FOR THOSE IN OAKLAND FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF SAN MATEO. TO TRY TO HELP BACKFILL SOME OF THAT. AND WHAT WE SAW ON THE PENINSULA IN THE BAY AREA. IS TREMENDOUS NEW COMMERCIAL OFFICE DEVELOPMENT COMING ONLINE SO WASN'T A QUESTION ABOUT BLIGHT. A PRIVATE INVESTMENTS COMING AND THESE WERE GENTRIFYING AREAS AND AS A LAW AND THERE'S A LOT OF OF INDUSTRY MOVING INTO THE AREA AND THAT'S WHERE THE JOBS HOUSING GAP WAS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND SO THE IDEA OF AB FIFTY NINETY EIGHT WAS. WE HARDLY GOT THIS INVESTMENT COMING AND BOTH FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ON AND ON THE JOB SITE. COULD WE CAPTURE A BILL THAT INCREMENT ONE ON THE PENINSULA UNLIKE OTHER PARTS THE STATE PERHAPS. HOW WE HAVE LISTENED TO PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT WERE SEEN ASSESSED VALUES OF PROPERTIES TEN PERCENT YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES IN ASSESSED VALUE AND PROPERTY TAX INCREASES FOR JURISDICTIONS? SO THEY'RE FEELING PEER PRETTY POSITIVE OUT THAT THE ISSUE IS CAN WE CAPTURE SOME OF THAT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S WERE ATTEMPTING TO DO. SOME OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT WE DID SEE WE ALSO DID WORKED ON. A BOOMERANG BILL. WAS A MEMBER BONTA WERE SOME OF THOSE REVENUES TO COME BACK. FROM THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT BACK TO JURISDICTIONS COULD YOU BOND AGAINST THOSE REVENUES. SANTA SITTING KIND OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS DONE THAT MOTHER JURISDICTION OF ACTUALLY DEDICATED SOME OF THOSE. THOSE LAWS ARE REVENUES COMING BACK THE WILD WHY MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE NOT DONE IT DOWN KIND OF ALLUDED TO THIS WITH THAT THEY DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT PENSION OBLIGATIONS THERE'D THERE'D WRESTLING WITH AND ON GOING ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THEIR THEIR A DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AND BONDS IS THEY STILL NEED TO PAY OFF BUT WE THINK THAT OVER TIME. HAS ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS ARE PAID OFF AS WE ADDRESS THE PENSION OBLIGATIONS THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL. REVENUES ARE POTENTIALLY IF WE HAVE THE BONDING AUTHORITY WITHOUT GOING THROUGH YOU KNOW. A ROOF GOAL OF OUR ECONOMY GOLDBERG KIND OF MECHANISM. AND JUST BE ABLE TO ISSUE DEBT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT INCREASING TAXES BUT YOU'RE TAPPING INTO SOME THOSE RESOURCES ARE COMING. UP FROM THE PARK PRIVATE INVESTMENT SO HAVING SAID ALL THOSE THINGS I WOULD SAY WE DO NEED THE LEGISLATURE STEP IN A HELP US WORK THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. ONE THE RESOURCES BEEN INCREMENTAL IS ONE TO MAKE SURE HE GOT IT RIGHT WITH DAN WITH THE CITY'S FIRST AS WE BUILT ON THAT. AND IT HAD A TOOL THAT WE COULD THEN TRY TO ENGAGE THE COUNTIES ON. AT BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY ESSENTIAL AND NOW WE THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY SOME SIGNIFICANT CLEAN UP THE SURE TO FIFTEEN NINETY EIGHT WITH WAS WITH SUMMER MULLIN AND WE HOPE THAT THE LEAGUE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE WITH US. WE ALSO NEED TO GET SEE SACK INVOLVED WE GOT COUNTIES APPROACHING US SAYING THAT WE LIKE TO LOOK AT THESE TWO ALSO SOME OF THE LANGUAGE WILL BE BRINGING FORWARD. WILL BE INPUT FROM CITIES FROM FROM COUNTIES AND ALSO FROM BOND COUNSEL THINGS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE NEED TO WRITE THOSE OPINIONS TO BE ABLE TO ISSUE THAT THAT. AND SO WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE GET THAT LANGUAGE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AS WE THINK REALLY CLOSE AND NOW'S THE TIME PARTICULAR TO TALK ABOUT AARTI AARTI TO POINT ON EVEN. PERHAPS HAVING THE STATE PARTICIPATE FIRST ALL GIVEN THE SAME PAGE WE GOT ALL THESE TOOLS AND I GOT THIS LANGUAGE NOW. IN IN THE CODE US MAKE SURE IT'S CONSISTENT AND LET'S MAKE SURE% TOLD A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY AND USER FRIENDLY TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO STAND THE SUB. IT IMMEDIATELY AND ACTION ARE BILL ANOTHER PIECE THE LANGUAGE WILL BE THAT YOU CONNECT THE BASED YOUR COULD ACTUALLY BE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR SHE COULD GO BACK. A MAXIMUM OF FIVE YEARS SO THAT ALL THAT GROWTH THAT WE'VE SEEN ATTACKS OCCUR WE TRY TO CAPTURE SOME OF THAT NOW. AND BEGIN ISSUE THAT THAT RIGHT AWAY WITHOUT HAVING TAKE LOANS FROM THE CITY THAT NEED TO BE. REPAID. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS MCCARTY TWO POINT ALLEN WHEN IT TO BRING OUR MEMBERS A RESOURCE EXPERIENCE TO BEAR ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ONE QUESTION. TO MICHAEL MAYBE TO ALSO MISTER CALDWELL HAVE YOU SEEN III OF TI'S USED TO BUILD HOUSING I KNOW IT CAN BE USED FOR HOUSING BUT THERE'S NOT A SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT TO. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE INTENDED USE IT FOR IT SAN DIEGO. IN IN SAN DIEGO WE ARE NOT. AGAIN HOPE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS FINANCE HOUSING I THINK WHERE THE IF ID FALL SHORT IS ON THE ASSEMBLAGE PIECE WHICH WE CAN DO AND WE ARE DOING WHAT OURS IS IT IS A MECHANISM WHERE WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THE. FEES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE IF ID DOLLARS TO TO HELP OFFSET THOSE BUT WE'RE WE'RE NOT USING IT DIRECTLY YET TO BUILD HOUSING. AND MICHAEL WHAT DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU NEED IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOCAL JURISDICTION TO DO AN OVERLAY. WHERE THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE THE CONCORD NAVAL WEAPONS STATION REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT THE REQUIRED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AFFORDABLE IN THAT BUILD OUT BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A REQUIREMENT IN THE I FD? WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT BE USED FOR HOUSING AT ALL FOR THE MOST PARTGOTCHA AND AND HELP WILL SHOW YOU ABOUT TO. MISTER MULLINS AJ. THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AUTHORITIES BEEN USED. IN THE NEAR FUTURE YOU FEEL YOU HEAR ABOUT PICK UP FROM CITIES WE'VE HAD S. SIX CITIES AND COUNTIES OF OUR BEENCONTACTING US AND IN FACT THE CLEANUP WILL SEE THIS YEAR COMING BEFORE YOU'VE. LIKELY BASED ON THAT INPUT AND I'D LIKE TO USE THAT IMMEDIATELY MAYBE WE COULD DO THAT'S PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT COULD TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY IF YOU'RE OPEN THAT. THAT. I DID HAVE A CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. SO I LIKE ALL THE TOOLS AM NOT AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT SOME OF THESE ARE WORKING IN THERE. YOU KNOW IN PROGRESS. MY CONCERN IS ON SOME OF THE SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES. THAT. I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING THIS IS A USER NECESSARY GONNA WORK WHEN YOU SAY STAFFING IS THAT COST. OUR OF. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENTS ARE GONE. SO. IF I'M LOOKING FOR SOME SUGGESTIONS AND YOU KNOW OF ANY SMALL COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT BE USING ANY THIS TOOLS CURRENTLY. BECAUSE THE ONE THING I'VE I'VE NOTICED MY SHORT TIME HERE. IS ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. AND. WHAT WHAT MIGHT WORK IN SAN DIEGO MAY NOT WORK FOR A COMMUNITY OF TEN THOUSAND? OR SEVEN THOUSAND OR SO I'M WERE. IT'S A SOMETHING I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T FORGET ABOUT. SO INELIGIBLE USED TO RURAL COMMITTEES ASSISTANCE CORPORATION AND YOU MAY NOTE PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY MAKE THAT A PART OF THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE YOU YOU YOU'RE RIGHT. NOT ONLY IN IN IN LARGER CITIES EVEN HER STRUGGLING TO STAFFING LOTS REDEVELOPMENT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT EVEN BEFORE THE. BLOSSOMING OF ALL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE SOME HE'S TOLD ME IN THE BILL TO GET THE WORD OUT SO THEY CAN DO THAT'S ALL WE COULD. SUM AS INTERMEDIARIES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE COULD MAKE THAT A PART OF THE PROCESS WE DON'T NEED COMMITTEES BEHIND I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY. VERY VALUABLE APPROACH LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU SOME CONTACTS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES. YOU CHOI. DON'T THINK YOU I WONDER PROBLEM. MON. SEVERAL OF THE ON TOOL RUSSO IN NEW OFF OUR REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY I COME FROM. ORANGE COUNTY. I WAS THE MAYOR OR BY. AND. P. MAUREEN COR A A A PIECE. I WAS SO TURNED INTO. NOW WHICH COUNTY GRAY PARKA. WE WILL VERY STRONGLY IN. BOMB MAKING PROGRESS. A WHEN USING THE. TAX INCREMENTS. A DEVELOPING THE PAUL GO. AND THE. RUG WAS SUPPORT AWAY WHEN THE REDEVELOPMENT DIE. SO WE HAD THE LITIGATIONS ETCETERA. A. AMONG THIS. TO DELTORA NAME SO THAT THE. E. I. F. DE. AND THE CREE. AHA. A. AND AND AYE F. T. OUR I AM NOT ABOUT SOUPS I KINDA THEY JUST TEAR. I WONDER IF FOR ANY OF THESE. TOURS SO. WATER APPLY TO. A MY DISTRICT UP PARTICULARLY UP FOR THAT. AREA CBO IRVINE BECAUSE SELF OUR. GENERAL. IF THE INCOME. A LEVEL. IT MAY NOT BE. QUALIFIED BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS AFFORDABLE HOMES WHAT DISADVANTAGED. CRIMINAL RATES ETCETERA YOU KNOW BEING THE SAFEST CITY IT MAY NOT APPLY BUT. HOW YOU DEFINE WHERE THE? THAT THE PARTICULAR PRESIDED AREA WE CAN SAY THAT THERE WAS A BLIGHTED BECAUSE NOTHING WAS THERE. DEFINITION Y. SAYS ENTIRE CITY OF IRVINE WENT. ANTI COUNTY OF ORANGE HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE IT AND. IF SO HOW WHICH OF THESE TOURISM MAY BE APPLICABLE TO ME. IN OUR LISTENING TO YOU HERE AM I WASTING IT MAY NOT BE MAKING ANY SENSE TO US A SO THAT'S WHAT I. WANT TO GET SOME IDEA FROM. YEAH AND SO WE WE HAVE GOOD FRIENDS OF THE CAN THE COMMISSION AND ORANGE COUNTY WHO'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ON SOME OF THESE TOOLS I THINK I THINK THAT THE HOUSING AUTHORITIES TO CAN WORK FOR YOU. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A BLIGHT FINDING AND ACTUALLY WE DO ALLOW YOU TO TO FUND A RANGE PREDICT IN HIGH COST AREAS TO GO UP TO HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT OF THEM I FOR WORKFORCE HOUSING. AS WELL AS LOWER INCOME HOUSING SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY OF MIXED INCOME DEVELOPMENTS THAT COULD BE FUNDED BASED ON YOUR ARENA ALLOCATION THAT YOU GET WHICH ALSO GOES UP TO THE MODERN VERSION OF WHICH TO WILLOW. CAN BE THAT WAS THAT WAS THE THE CREE A PLUS THAT WE EXPAND ON THREE AB FIFTEEN NINETY EIGHT YEAH I THINK YOU. THERE'S TOOL TOOLS TO TOOLS ON THAT LIST. ONE IS E. IFT THERE IS NO THERE IS NO INCOME LIMITATION THERE'S NO THERE'S NO IT THE YOU COULD PUT YOU COULD PUT THE WHOLE AREA UNDER ANY AYE HEFTY TECHNICALLY I MEAN THERE THERE'S A REALLY US BUT AS I SAID BEFORE POLITICAL AGREEMENT. THAT THE COURT SO THAT'S HE AYE FD I THINK YOU COULD SEE IRVINE COULD USE IT THEY'D OFFICE TO OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE TO LOOK THROUGH LOOK THREATEN AND MAKE IT JUST MAKE DECISIONS BUT THEY COULD USE IT. UP THE CREEL LOG MAYBE NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE INCOME RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE THE CREEL LAW WAS TRYING TO AT LEAST GET BACK TO THE WHAT WAS THE COR IDEA OF REDEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS. YOU HAD A TRASHED AREA AND YOU WANTED TO FIX IT UP YOU KNOW AND AND AND TO THE EXTENT THE OLD ALREADY A WAS. WAS A CRITICIZED SOMETIMES. THAT THEY WERE CRITICIZED BECAUSE MAYBE THE AREA WASN'T. WAS INVITED AND THAT NOT WAS PART OF THE ISSUE SO YOU HAVE IF YOU WANT TO DO REGULAR INFRASTRUCTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT YOU CAN GO TO ANY AYE FD GO FOR IT. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DO URBAN DOWNTOWN REDEVELOPMENT THEN SOMETHING LIKE A CAREER OR MAYBE A WERE WERE IMPROVED KOREA IS SOMETHING. THAT YOU COULD USE. THAT'S THE THING ABOUT THE. THE OUSING AUTHORITY IDEA AGAIN THERE IS NO NO INCOME LIMITATION IT'S KIND OF LIKE IN THE YEAH E. FID. AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHERE YOU CAN USE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET SALES TAXES THOUGH YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR WHOLE JURISDICTION IN ONE. BUT BUT YOU YOU DON'T HAVE IT ISN'T IT THERE ISN'T A RESTRICTION OF HOW MUCH SALES TAXES YOU DONATE SO I THINK THAT THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AUTHORITY IS GOING TO BE A VERY USEFUL TOOL. ANOTHER THING THAT I WOULD LOOK AT AND. DAMN IT'S IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE WE DID OUR CREE ANALYSIS BUT I BELIEVE WHEN WE DID OUR CREATE ANALYSIS. WELL LIBERTY STATION WHICH HASN'T SEEN DIEGO IS A FORMER NAVY BASE AND I BELIEVE WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE THAT INTO THAT ANALYSIS AS AN ELIGIBLE CENSUS TRACT. BY THE MERE FACT THAT IT WAS OF A CLOSED MILITARY FACILITATORS FACILITIES SO I BELIEVE THERE IS A. A CARVE OUT IN THE CREEL LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS FORMER MILITARY BASES. TO YOU THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT DEVELOPMENT YOU'VE ALREADY STARTED. JUNE TWO UNDERTAKEN HOW MUCH BLOOD HAS BEEN ALLEVIATED IT'S IT'S CONSIDER BLIGHTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ELESSAR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. APPRECIATE YOUR BRIEFING AND YOUR PERSPECTIVE VANDALIC FORTY FUTURE CONVERSATIONS. LET ME INVITE UP THE FINAL PANEL TO PROVIDE OTHER PERSPECTIVES ON TAX INCREMENT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOOLS WE HAVE FIGHT EGON TO PLAN. UP FROM. SPUR TRISH KELLY FROM VALLEY VISION CRAG CASTELLANA OF FROM THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT AND DOROTHY JOHNSON FROM C. SACK. AND AS FOLKS GET SETTLED. I WILL ASK FOR PRESENTATIONS IN THE ORDER IN THE HEARING AT WHICH WOULD MEAN WE START WHISPER. YOU TROUBLING. I GOOD AFTERNOON A A HUNTER BUT WAS SPUR WERE IN URBAN POLICY THINK TANK AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE THREE CENTRAL CITIES OF THE BAY AREA WITH OFFICES IN SAN FRANCISCO. OAKLAND AND SAN JOSE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON URBAN REDEVELOPMENT REVITALIZATION ON PARTICULAR ENDURED ON STATION SAN JOSE AND TRANSMIT TERMINAL IN DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'VE. I'VE LET OUR WORK LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF THE THREE DOWNTOWNS IN THE BAY AREA BUT ACTUALLY IN PART TODAY WHAT I'M HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU IS SOME THOUGHTS AND WORK WE DID OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. REALLY LOOKING AT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM AMONG THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REVITALIZATION AROUND ON THE RAIL STATIONS BOTH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL I'M WILL BE MANAGING BUT REALLY BROADLY THINKING ABOUT RAIL IN THE OPPORTUNITY AND SO I THINK THERE ARE COPIES. OF THIS REPORT. AROUND YOUR DESK AND AND I RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW SOME VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT RURAL AREAS THIS IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT A VARIETY OF PLACES AND SO WHAT I HOPE I CAN SPEAK TO IS A LITTLE BIT OF SOME DISTINCTIONS. BETWEEN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE WERE LOOKING AT HERE FROM FROM THE PRIOR OR ADDITIONS. FROM SOME OF THE PRIOR PIECE THEN REALLY ALSO I'M APPLYING THIS THINKING ABOUT REVITALIZATION. IN A LITTLE AHEAD OF A BROADER WAY ABOUT REALLY WHAT WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH FOR THE BIG GOALS OF OVER TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AS A STATE I'M AND IN PARTICULAR PLACES. AND SO THE SO THE REPORT THAT THAT WE DID WE WORK WITH THE WITH A HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IN THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AND A VARIETY OF OTHER PEOPLE. I'M BUT IN PART THE THE QUESTION THAT WE WERE ASKING WAS WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE OPPORTUNITY FROM THIS MASSIVE STATE INVESTMENT IT IS NOT JUST A TRANSPORTATION PROJECT. IT IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESHAPE HOW THE STATE GROWS WHERE IT GROWS AND TO BRING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTS OF THE STATE SO IN PART VII THE EMPHASIS ON THE THINKING HERE WERE. THE INTERMEDIATE STATIONS AND PARTICULARLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AMID TO A CERTAIN EXTENT GILROY IN AND AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY THE PLACES WHERE THE IMPACT OF RAIL INVESTMENT IS NOT AS OBVIOUS IF YOU LOOK AT JAPAN IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. RAIL INVESTMENT ACTUALLY THE BENEFITS CAN SOMETIMES A CREW QUITE A BIT TO THATTODAY. CENTRAL CITIES BUT WE WANTED TO SAY IN CALIFORNIA WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WEARING THE BENEFITS AND BAKERSFIELD AND FRESNO AMBER SAID AND SO IN A LOT OF THAT THE WORK WE DID HERE WE HAD WE CONVENED. A MEMBERS AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION CITIES INTO A SERIES OF DIALOGUES THAT SAID I THINK A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I SHARE WITH YOU AT A HIGH LEVEL. ARE VERY APPLICABLE TO SAN JOSE AND APPLICABLE TO OAKLAND APPLICABLE CERTAINLY TO SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES ON AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. CITY BEGIN A COUPLE OF MAYBE POINTS OF OF OF. IN ADDITION BEYOND WHAT WE WE HEARD FROM THE PEOPLE BEFORE I'M ONE OF THEM IS REALLY THE IDEA OF INSURING THAT THE STATE GETS A RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT FOR A LOT OF THE WORK THAT IT'S DOING I THINK WE HEARD FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES THE NOTION OF. IT BEING APPROPRIATE FOR THERE TO BE SOME LEVEL OF STATE OVERSIGHT TO MEET STATE GOALS BUT TO KIND OF TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER WHEN THE STATE IS MAKING AN INVESTMENT HOW DOES THE STATE ALSO PARTICIPATE. I'M IN SOME OF THE UPSIDE. A SECOND POINT IS REALLY THINKING AROUND THE IDEA OF JOINT GOVERNANCE OF KIND OF LOCALS AND THE STATE COLLECTIVELY WORKING TOGETHER TO IMAGINE THE OUTCOMES OF THESE PLACES SOMETHING WE DIDN'T DO IN REDEVELOPMENT REDEVELOPMENTS VERY MUCH. ON THE LOCAL PROGRAM THERE'S A QUITE A VARIETY OF DISTINCTION. I'M A THIRD POINT THIS WAS REFERENCE A LITTLE BIT FROM THE FROM THE OTHERS SPEAKERS WAS THAT THE TOOLS WE HAVE HAVE LIMITATIONS BUT IN MANY WAYS ARE NOT MANDATORY SAYS WE THINK ABOUT ADDITIONAL TOOLS. TO WHAT EXTENT DO WE WANT THE PARTICIPATION IN THEM. TO TO BE MANDATORY. AND THEN I WOULD ALSO KIND OF ADD ADD TO THAT TWO ADDITIONAL POINTS ONE IS THAT WE'RE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT COMMUNITY. REDEVELOPMENT REVITALIZATION AS BEING A LOT BROADER THAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOLS IN FACT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH THE STATE WATER SOME OF OUR LARGER POLICY GOALS. AND WHAT ARE SOME LARGER APPROACHES TO THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTIONS AROUND I'M REGIONAL LAND USE AND IN A SENSE CAPTURING GROWTH WITH IN URBAN AREAS WRIT LARGE PRESERVING FARMLAND AND PROTECTING. I'M OPEN SPACES IS RELATED TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE COURSE OF THE CITY'S I'M WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA WHAT KIND OF PLANNING CRITERIA SHOULD WE BE APPLYING TO PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES SHOULD THE STATE BE SETTING THOSE CRITERIA. ARE I'M. IN ADDITION KIND OF TWO LAST POINTS AROUND THE SORT OF AN ADDITIONAL PIECE IS. BE IMPLEMENTATION IS OFTEN FORGOTTEN WE HEARD ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES IS HUGE LOSS OF HUMAN CAPITAL WITH WITH THE END OF THOSE SYSTEMS WE ALSO THE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANS. THE PROGRAMS IN CREATING SOME KIND OF IN. DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OR SOME SORT OF ENTITY THE AND THEY CAN CARRY IT OUT AND I WOULD ALSO BE REMISS BY NOT BRINGING UP THE ROLE OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE INTEGRATION OF ALL THE VARIOUS INVESTMENTS. IN TRANSPORTATION IN OUR DOWNTOWNS I MEAN OUR STATION AREAS AND SO THE PROSPECTIVE I'M BRINGING A LITTLE BIT AND HERE IS HOW DO WE. ENSURE THAT THIS CONVERSATION REALLY WORKS. FOR RAIL STATIONS REALLY WORKS FOR TRANSIT FACILITIES. SO LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW POINTS KIND OF ABOUT THE RAIL OPPORTUNITY. AND AND KIND OF SOME VERY SPECIFIC A TARGETED RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT TO DO SO. WE ARE WE ARE MAKING A MAJOR INVESTMENT RAILING CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL IS A PIECE ABOUT THE STATE RAIL PLAN IS ANOTHER ONE AND SO WE HAVE DOZENS OF PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE GONNA BE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER. AS PART OF A NETWORK AND SO THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY HELP REALIZE THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS UNHOOK SHIFT PEOPLE AWAY FROM FROM AUTOMOBILES AND IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE THINK A LOT ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING AROUND THIS PLACES. IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT WE THINK ABOUT COMMERCIAL OF ELEMENT AND JOBS AND DESTINATIONS AROUND RAIL AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN I'M INTERNATIONALLY AND SEEN IN THE BAY AREA THAT. IF RICHEST IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS GETTING PEOPLE ON TO TRANSIT ON TO RAIL WE GOT A BUNCH OF JOBS AND DESTINATIONS AROUND THE RAIL STATIONS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IN THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TOOLS AND IN THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TRANSIT ON THAT SIDE OF LAND USE. SHOULDN'T CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE A PART OF THAT. AND THEN I AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE GETS A RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENT. BUT WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THESE CHALLENGES. AND IN PARTICULAR THE THE THE AREA THAT I WANT TO BE OUT A LITTLE BIT TOO IS THINKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF OF PLACES WHERE THE MARKET. CONTEXT IS IS REALLY DIFFICULT CERTAINLY. THE PARTS OF SAN DIEGO WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THERE'S A NEED FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT TO KIND OF GET THE PRIVATE MARKET TO COME IN LATER THAT'S ONE SET OF MARKET CHALLENGES THERE'S ANOTHER SET OF MARKET CHALLENGES WE TAKE A PLACE LIKE A DOWNTOWN FRESNO. WHERE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THERE'S GOING TO BE PLANNED FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION THERE'S AN EXISTING AMTRAK STATION A BUT UNDER CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS? A AN OFFICE BUILDING THAT SAY COULD GENERATE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BUCKS. IN SCHOOL A KIND OF SQUARE FOOT OF HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS OUT OF A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SQUARE FOOT COST TO BUILD A NEW OFFICE BUILDING SOLELY ABOUT HALF. OF THE VALUE OF THAT BUILDING CAN BE GENERATED BY THE CURRENT MARKET RENT SO YOU HAVE A GAP. I'M A MAJOR GAP AND THAT'S IN FACT WHY YOU DON'T SEE MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT I'M IN THAT CONTEXT. EVEN A PLACE LIKE DOWNTOWN OAKLAND ON WHICH FOR FOR DECADES HAS HAD BART HAS STRUGGLED TO GET MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT OVER A HUGE AMOUNT OF THIS TIME PERIOD SO WE KNOW THAT. RAIL ON ITS OWN AND SOME OF THESE EXISTING TOOLS WE HAD ON ITS OWN WERE INSUFFICIENT SO WE HAVE TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY ARM AND IT TO ENSURE THAT THAT TAKES PLACE. ANOTHER CHALLENGE WE'VE ALSO SEEN IS THAT SOME TO THAT THERE ARE TIMES THAT THE VISION THAT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS FOR WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THEIR RAIL STATION OR IN THEIR DOWNTOWN. MIGHT NOT REINFORCE OVERALL STATEWIDE GOALS AND THERE MIGHT BE THE DESIRE FOR I'M ONE STORY TOWN HOMES AS IMPORTANT AS THOSE ARE. ACROSS THE STREET FROM A HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION ORB SURFACE PARKING LOTS ARE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PARKING OR OTHER KIND OF VISIONS THAT THAT ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE DAY. ARE PROBABLY NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE IF WE LOOK FORWARD SEVERAL DECADES SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SORT OF RISING TO THE CHALLENGE. OF THE OPPORTUNITY AND THAT THE STATE IS REALLY ENSURE THAT IT GETS A RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT ON THAT THAT IT'S PUTTING INTO THESE CONCEPTS. AND OF COURSE WE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE TOOLS THEMSELVES AS WE'VE BEEN SPENDING THE AFTERNOON THINKING ABOUT ARE INSUFFICIENT TO THE TASK AND I THINK TO CUT TO THE CHASE ON THAT THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH MONEY. WHEN YOU TAKE THE PORTION OF THE THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION YOU KNOW THE CITY COULD DO IT BUT THEN THE COUNTY MAY NOT PARTICIPATE. AND AND AND I WOULD ARGUE ONE ADDITIONAL PIECE THAT THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SIMPLY THE LOCAL PORTION. OR THE VARIOUS PARTS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. STATE COULD BE A PARTICIPANT I THINK THE NIFTY I'M CONCEPT FROM LAST YEAR IS A VERSION OF THE LOCAL PORTION OF THE SALES TAX BUT MAYBE WE COULD TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AND IMAGINE SOME OTHER STATE INVESTMENTS. SO LET ME CLOSE WITH A COUPLE OF KIND OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM FROM WHAT WE SEE ARE COMING OUT HERE IN THIS I WOULD SAY THESE REALLY BUILD FROM WHAT WE WHAT WE LEARN FROM FROM REDEVELOPMENT BUT REALLY YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE IT. ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL. FIRST POINT AND AND ALL I WANNA GET TO THE TOOL SPECIFICALLY BUT I WANNA MAKE KIND OF THIS OF THE BROADER PIECES IS THAT THE LOCAL PLANS FOR THESE DISTRICTS FOR THESE AREAS WHAT HOWEVER THERE TO FIND I'M I'M PARTICULARLY FOCUSED YOU'RE ON SORT OF RAIL STATION AREAS. BUT WE CAN HAVE DISTRICTS OF ANY KIND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY OUGHT TO BE DEVELOPED IN LINE WITH SOME KIND OF STATE OVERSIGHT GOALS OR IS IT SOME SORT OF VISION OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO WHETHER THAT'S REDUCING OUR IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE OR PRESERVING FARMLAND. ENSURING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP THESE ARE IMPORTANT STATEWIDE GOALS SO WHAT'S BEING PRODUCED LOCALLY SHOULD SHOULD REINFORCE THAT. THE SECOND IS THAT WE NEED SOME KIND OF A DELIVERY ENTITY WHETHER IT'S A DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION THAT YES MIGHT HAVE THESE POWERS OF EMINENT DOMAIN BUT IT MIGHT ALSO HAVE BONDING AUTHORITY MIGHT ALSO BE HAVE THE EXPERTISE. OF PEOPLE WHO CAN REALLY MAKE A DEAL HAPPEN I'M BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE WHATEVER TOOLS WE WANT BUT YOU NEED YOU NEED YOU KNOW THE EXPERTISE BUT ALSO THAT KIND OF. POWERFUL ENTITY THAT CAN REALLY AREN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN AND THEN OF COURSE WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT ABOUT MODIFICATIONS TO THE TOOLS SO. FIVE VERY BRIEF MODIFICATIONS ONE. THE SHARING IS NOT VOLUNTARY THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF MANDATORY. PARTICIPATION SOAP CITIES AND COUNTIES TOGETHER ARE BOTH PUTTING IN THEIR PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT IS AN EXAMPLE. AND IF THEIR THEIR DISTRICT. SECOND KIND OF UP MODIFICATION. AND AND WHEN I SAY MODIFICATION THESE COULD BE LEGISLATIVE MODIFICATIONS TO THE E. AYE FDA'S COULD BE A NEW PIECE OF LEGISLATION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE REDEVELOPMENT LAW IS STILL ON THE BOOKS. SOME THAT STUFF COULD COME BACK BUT JUST IN TERMS OF PARTICULAR CHANGES I'M POINT TO. THAT THERE IS BOTH STATE AND LOCAL PARTICIPATION THAT IF THE LOCALS ARE PUTTING UP THE INCREMENTAL PROPERTY TAX. MAYBE THE STATE'S ALSO PUTTING UP ITS INCREMENT IN THE SALES TAX NOT THE LOCAL PORTION BUT THAT BUT THE PORTION GOES TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND. AND MAYBE THEN THE LOCALS ARE ALSO PUTTING UP THE GROWTH IN THE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX IT'S THAT YOU KNOW THE HOTEL TAX OR OTHER TOOLS SO WE CREATE A VEHICLE. OR MULTIPLE REVENUE STREAMS CAN COME IN AND IT GETS BETTER. POINT THREE THAT THE STATE IS INVOLVED IN SOME KIND OF OVERSIGHT. NOT JUST SETTING SOME CRITERIA BY WHICH A LOCAL DISTRICT PLAN PASSED TO IT HERE BUT MAYBE THERE'S A SEAT ON THE LOCAL BOARD FOR. SOME MEMBER OF THE STATE FROM THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL OP ARE AND THEIR THERE'S A SHARED GOVERNANCE IDEA LOCAL COUNTY MAYBE THE MPO MAYBE THE TRANSIT OPERATORS APPROPRIATE. THAT THERE'S SHARED GOVERNANCE AND MULTIPLE PIECES. AND THEN POINTS FOR AND FIVE A MUCH SMALLER ONE IS THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE AND WE REALLY NEED SOME EARLY STAGE FINANCING TO GET PROJECTS OFF THE GROUND TO KICKSTART TAX INCREMENT FINANCING. SO THAT THAT THE PLACES THAT ARE GOING TO BE GENERATING AS MUCH LOCALLY WE NEED WE NEED TO KIND OF JUMP START THEM AND MAYBE SOME OF THOSE STATE REVENUES ARE APPROPRIATE. AND THEN AND THEN FINALLY A SMALLER ONE THIS EXISTS IN SOME OF THE BILLS BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THE BONDS THAT CAN BE APPROVED WITH WITHOUT A PUBLIC VOTE. I'M KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROCESS GOES FORWARD. BUT SO LONG AS WHAT'S BEING PLANTED ENVISIONED IS MATCHING UP WITH. THOSE STATEWIDE GOALS FROM THE OUTSET AND IS A HEARING WITH THE PLAN THAT WAS REALLY DEVELOPED AND IT'S GOT A BROAD VISION OF OF WHAT TO HAPPEN IN THOSE PLACES. SO IN CONCLUSION WHAT WHAT WE'RE ARGUING WHAT WE SEEING IS IT THERE ARE A SET OF IDEAS THAT WE SAW AS WE WERE THINKING ABOUT THIS QUESTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL STATIONS. BUT WE CAN BROADEN FROM THAT AND EXTRAPOLATE FROM THAT THAT THIS IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE AS WELL FOR MANY RAIL STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND INDEED SOME OF THESE IDEAS GENERALLY APPLIED. THEY NEED TO BE TARGETED AND KIND OF TWEAK TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF CONTACTS BUT SOME OF THE POLICY PRINCIPLES OF STATE AND LOCAL SHARING AND PARTICIPATION IN MEETING THESE SORT OF GOALS I THINK APPLIED. DIFFERENTLY TO RURAL AREAS AMONG OTHER PARTS THE STATE TO HABITAT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT A QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES. JUST HAD CUT. TWO TWO QUICK QUESTIONS I THANK YOU FOR THIS REPORT I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO I GO THROUGH IT THOROUGHLY. BUT IF IT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE AFTER THIS IF YOU COULD JUST SEND A QUICK EMAIL TO HIGHLIGHT WHICH ASPECTS OF IT YOU THINK WE COULD AS LEGISLATORS SORT OF LEAN INTO I THINK ABOUT. HOW THE STREET SIDE I TOOK NOTES ON THE FIVE BUT I COULDN'T FIND THEM IN YOUR? IN YOUR PRESENTATION AYE YET I ONE ONE THING THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A DOCUMENT ON THE BACK THAT I HAVE COPIES OF I CAN SHARE TO EACH OF YOU BUT IT'S A PLAN OF ACTION THAT ACTUALLY HAS A SERIES OF BULLETS. UNDER THE STATE LEGISLATURE. HOW CORRECT THE SOME OF THE PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATIONS AND I'D SAY IT'S REALLY AROUND THE THE KIND OF? ESTABLISHING SOME OF THE READ THE REVITALIZATION TOOL. IS PERFECTLY WITHIN YOUR. MANDATE AND I THINK THAT'S VERY MUCH THE DISCUSSION OF X. HERE. AND I MEAN I COULD VERY QUICKLY SAY IT'S IT'S REALLY RECOMMENDATIONS. TO. SIX SEVEN. NINE ELEVEN TWO SIX SEVEN. NINE ELEVEN OKAY BUT TODAY WE'VE REALLY BEEN FOCUSING MORE ON RECOMMENDATION SIX WHICH IS THIS REVITALIZATION TOOL. AND TWEAKS TO THAT GREAT THANK YOU FOR FOCUSING US AND THEN A SECOND QUESTION HOW'S THE SPEND DISCUSSED WITH THE HIGH SPEED AUTHORITY. WHAT CONVERSATIONS HAVE HAPPENED AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH THE VARIOUS TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES SAID EVEN WORKING WITH? GREAT NIGHT SIX SO I I'D I'D NEGLECTED TO SAY THAT MY BEGINNING SO THIS WAS DEVELOPED WITH WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AND WAS TAKEN THROUGH THAT THERE'S A TRANSIT LAND USE COMMITTEE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. AND SO THIS CAME OUT OF A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS ON THAT WE HAD THERE AND SO SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN IT THERE'S BEEN A SERIES OF FOLLOW ON QUESTIONS. OF OF AND CONVERSATIONS ON HOW HOW DO WE GET SOME OF THESE IDEAS IMPLEMENTED I THINK IS QUITE A BIT OF INTEREST. I'M IN YOU KNOW A CALLOUSED ON HIGH SPEED RAIL AND AND OTHER PARTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN IMAGINING HOW DO WE IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE IDEAS TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE GET THE RIGHT OUT COMES AROUND. I THINK PARTICULAR AROUND RAIL STATIONS BROADER THAN THAN SIMPLY HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT REALLY INTERCITY RAIL ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK I THINK I MAY REQUEST A MEETING WITH YOU AND OTHER COLLEAGUES FROM THAT CONVERSATION PROBLY OFFLINE TO UNDERSTAND. THAT WHAT THE INTEREST ISN'T SPECIFICALLY WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO THIS YEAR ON SOME. WE'RE HAPPY TO DO SO GREAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. NOT VERY INTERESTING YOU KNOW STUDY I I COULDN'T GET THROUGH ALL OF IT BECAUSE WE JUST GOT IT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON BUT. I HAD. SERVED IT ON THE CITY COUNCIL IN ESCONDIDO WHICH IS ONE OF THE STATIONS. AND I ALSO SERVED FOR EIGHT YEARS ON THE LOCAL. TRANSIT AUTHORITY. SO. WE HAVE DURING MY TENURE WE HAD GOTTEN THE FULL FUNDING GRANT AGREEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE COMMUTER RAIL IT GOES FROM. THE COAST INLAND. THE SPRINTER RAIL LINE. AND WHAT WE DID ON ALL THE STATIONS WAS A SIMILAR PLANNING CONCEPT YOU KNOW. REALLY WORKING WITH EACH CITY BECAUSE. WHEN IS THE TRANSIT AUTHORITY ON THE RAIL LINE SO WE HAD AUTHORITY. ON THAT RAIL LINE ALONG WITH. THEM BE IN SF. OF FREE WHICH WE SHARED. SO FOR THE PLANNING WE WORKED WITH EACH CITY INDIVIDUALLY AND WE WERE ABLE TO YOU KNOW DO A LOT OF THESE GOALS AS FAR AS THE PLANNING. BUT THE DISTRICT ITSELF. CONTROLLED WHAT IT DID ON THE LAND THAT OWNED IT HAD ACTUALLY BOUGHT UP LAND AROUND SO WAS ABLE TO DO YOU KNOW SOME DEVELOPMENTS A MIXED USE AND THINGS LIKE THAT HOME. BECAUSE YOU WANNA. TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE STATIONS. IN KNOW FOR PEOPLE GETTING THE WORK STUDENTS WE EVEN A. CREATED A SEPARATE. BYPASS OF THE LINE TO GO TO. CAL STATE SAN MARCUS. WHICH THE STUDENTS USE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS ONE YOU KNOW. I HEADS OF JUGGLE BETWEEN BEING A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND WORK ON THE TRANSIT BOARD. WAS THE CONCEPT OF THE LOCAL CONTROL WHICH. YOU KNOW IF THE STATE. HAS OVERSIGHT JUST LIKE WE AT THE TRANSIT DISTRICT HAD OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT WE OWNED BUT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO. DICTATE TO THE CITIES YOU KNOW WHAT THEY COULD DO WE COULD WORK WITH THEM AND I'M WONDERING. YOU KNOW WITHOUT BYPASS AND LOCAL CONTROL WHICH CITIES WANNA KEEP HOW CAN. YOU KNOW THE CONCEPTS THE STATE OPERATE LIKE A CARROT ON THE STICK KIND OF OMAR AND INCENTIVE TO BRING THE CITY'S. YOU KNOW THERE'S SHOULD BE AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM. I MEAN THEY CAN SEE THE GOALS OF THE OF THE TAX INCREMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THEY UNFORTUNATE THING WAS THE AREA WHERE ARE TRANSIT STATION IS WAS IN THE CENTER OF OUR REDEVELOPMENT AREA WHICH WAS JUST. YOU KNOW BEGGING TO BE WE'VE DEVELOPED SO WHEN WE LOST THAT IT REALLY KILLED US SO I JUST I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT GONNA. OVERRIDING LOCAL CONTROL ALSO I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE RAISING A REALLY GOOD POINT BUT IT BUT ON A IF WHAT I HEAR FROM YOUR EXAMPLE IS SOMETHING WE SEE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A CHALLENGE OF FRAGMENTED DECISION MAKING THAT LOCAL CONTROL OFTEN REFERS SIMPLY TO THE KIND OF LAND USE DECISIONS AT THE LOCAL CITY OR COUNTY HAS. BUT THEY'RE ALSO A SERIES OF OTHER DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE'S THE TRANSIT SYSTEM GONNA PUT ITS TRAIN AND WHO HAS AUTHORITY ON THE TRACKS AND THERE'S SEVENTY FIVE OTHER DECISIONS ARE OFTEN MADE BY OF KIND OF IN A FRAGMENTED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. AND WHAT I THINK PART OF WHAT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED AND WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT UP A GROUP OF LEADERS FROM SAN JOSE LAST SUMMER TO LOOK AT RAIL STATIONS IN. AND FRANCE AND AND THE NETHERLANDS TO UNDERSTAND THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION YOU'RE GETTING OUT AND WE HEARD A VERY GOOD POINT FROM ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO DONE STATION ABOUT MEN IN THE NETHERLANDS WHICH WAS. ALL THESE ENTITIES INVOLVED THE RAIL SYSTEM TO LOCAL CITIES THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT. THEY ALL PARTICIPATED TOGETHER IN FORMING A JOINT GOVERNING BOARD TO DEVELOP THE STATIONS. THEY ALL GOT LESS THAN THEY WANTED. BUT MORE THAN THEY EXPECTED. SO BY JOINTLY GOING IN AND SAYING WE ARE GONNA MAKE SOMETHING BIG HAPPEN IN THIS PLACE YET MAYBE GOT TO GIVE UP A LITTLE BIT IF WE WORKED INDEPENDENTLY. BUT WE ACHIEVE SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER BY COMING TOGETHER AROUND. AND SO THIS IS A LITTLE BROADER THAN THE REVITALIZATION CONVERSATION THIS AFTERNOON BUT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SHARED GOVERNANCE AROUND STATIONS WHERE YOU'VE GOT UP A BUNCH OF PEOPLE. PUTTING MONEY AND THAT MIGHT LEAD TO WEAR HIM OF THE TRACKS HOW DO YOU GET THE TRAINS TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER WHO BUILDS RUNS A STATION. WHO BUILDS THE BUILDINGS ON IT WHAT REVITALIZATION TOOLS HELP THE NEW HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING ALL OF THOSE PIECES TOGETHER SO I THINK IT CAN BE DONE? ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT UNDERMINING LOCAL CONTROL BUT ACTUALLY HELPING REALIZE THE VISION THAT THE LOCAL CITIES HAVE BY GIVING THEM ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THEY'RE WORKING IN A MORE COORDINATED WAY. WITH TRANSIT WITH THE STATE WITH THESE OTHER ENTITIES. BOB WOODWORKING NO IN LA WOULDN'T WORK IN ESCONDIDO OR WINTERS ARE YOU KNOW RIGHT SO AND NEEDS COMMUNITY HAS ITS OWN. YOU KNOW ULTIMATE VISION. RIGHT SO I IT'S KIND OF LIKE A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES TYPE OF THING. THAT CAN DO FINANCING YEAH I CAN DO FINANCING BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S IT'S ALSO IT'S THE COORDINATION OF. WHERE'S THAT BUS STOP IS THE BUS STOP GOING TO BE ON WHAT SIDE OF THE BUILDING IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST THE FINANCING IT'S ALSO SOME OF THE. THE TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS IN THE LOCATION OF PARKING AND I THINK TO MAKE THESE DISTRICTS WORK HAVING. ALL THOSE ENTITIES AT THE TABLE IN A COORDINATED WAY CAN HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION MOVE ON TO. FISH KELLY SHE IS THE MANAGING. DIRECTOR AT VALLEY VISION WELCOME. VERY MUCH. CHILDREN. I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY VALLEY VISION IS OF REGIONAL CIVIC LEADERSHIP ORGANIZATION WERE BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND IN. STOCKTON AND WE ALSO COLLABORATE WITH MANY PARTNERS ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE PART OF A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF REGIONAL COLLABORATIONS CALLED. CALIFORNIA STORAGE OF NETWORK. SO MY OWN BACKGROUND IS THAT I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME CONSULTING AS AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONER WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES I'VE DONE A LOT OF RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES I PREPARED GRANT APPLICATIONS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SO. I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND THAT THAT CAPACITY ISSUE A LOT OF TIMES CONSULTANTS ARE HIRED ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT. HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PREPARE. AND COMPETE FOR FUNDING FOR WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. TELEVISION ALSO MANAGES THE REGIONAL BROADBAND CONSORTIUM WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND THAT IS TO TRY TO PROVIDE OUT FUNDING FOR EIGHTEEN CONSORTIUM ACROSS THE STATE. SIMILAR TO OURS TO TRY TO ADDRESS OUR BROADBAND GAPS AND SO. WE HAVE LOOKED AT THINGS LIKE YAHYA YAHYA PHDS. AND WE HAVE NOT HAD A LOT OF UPTAKE FOR SOME OF THE REASONS YOU'VE HEARD IN WHICH WE'D LIKE TO. DISCUSS TODAY. WE ALSO HAVE A FEDERAL GRANT TO PROMOTE FOOD BEVERAGE MANUFACTURING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH OTHER PARTNERS AND THAT INCLUDES INFRASTRUCTURE. NEEDS AND CHALLENGES AND SO AGAIN WE FACE A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AROUND WIDE THESE TOOLS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. TO BE UP TO SPEED YET. SO ONE THING I'D LIKE TO REFERENCE IS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PREPARED A PRIMER ON THESE NEW FINANCING TOOLS WHICH I THINK IS VERY VALUABLE. WILL PROVIDE THAT AND SOME OF MY REMARKS TODAY ARE FROM. FROM THIS PRIMER AND THEY DID A VERY GOOD FACT SHEET AS WELL. SO. THEIR BIGGEST OUR FOCUS IS THAT THESE TOOLS ARE GOING TO BE VERY USEFUL AND WE NEED TO PUT THEM IN PLACE NOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES. FOR BOTH THE PLANNING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION AS WAS MENTIONED AND SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES ARE ARE THAT THEY'RE EXPENSIVE TO SET UP SO INCLUDE STAFF TIME CONSULTANTS SPECIAL COUNSEL. AND YOU NEED TO CONSIDER THE TIME IN THE COSTS FOR THINGS LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO REVENUE ESTIMATES TO DETERMINE FISCAL FEASIBILITY. UNIT OUT% REACHING NEGOTIATIONS WITH FINANCING AUTHORITIES FORMATION OF A PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCY OR JPA IF NECESSARY YOU HAVE TO DRAFT A PLAN FOR ADOPTION. AND BOTH OF THESE ARE SUBSTANTIVE DOCUMENTS AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO SEEK WORK AND THEN IN THE CASE OF A SEE OUR. OUR AYE A YOU MAY NEED A BOAT SO THERE ARE A LOT OF MECHANICS TO PUTTING THESE TOOLS TOGETHER THAT DO HAVE A COST IMPLICATION. IN A CAPACITY IN STAFFING IMPLICATION FOR COMMUNITIES. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED WAS ABOUT THE FINANCING PIECE SO IF YOU HAVE A SHOVEL READY PROJECT IN YOU READY TO GET INTO THE GROUND BUT YOU HAVE A BILL YOU TAX INCREMENT FINANCING UP. HOW DO YOU GET THAT PROJECT GOING SO THIS IS WHERE THE IDEA PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN WORKING WITH OTHER INVESTORS TO COMMIT ON THE FRONT END? IS GOING TO BE WHAT YOU NEED TO GET THE PROJECT GOING AS YOU BUILD THE INCREMENT. BUT WITH THE IMPROVEMENT ONE OF THE FINANCING TOOLS CAN BE THE BONDS BUT IF YOU HAVE TO GO FOR VOTER APPROVAL FOR FIFTY FIVE PERCENT AND YOU DON'T GET THE BOND APPROVAL THEN YOU LOSE THE FUNDING ALSO. SO YOU KNOW YOU SORT OF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALIGNMENT OF YOUR FUNDING SOURCES SO. WHAT THE OF PRIMER BASICALLY SAID IN CONSULTATION WITH A LOT OF PRACTITIONERS IS THAT THESE TOOLS HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESS? WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF FINANCING AUTHORITIES COLLABORATING TOGETHER WHO WHICH OR HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO MOVE THE PROJECTS TOGETHER FOR FORWARD TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE STRONG COMMUNITY SUPPORT. AND I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE COLLABORATION BUT AGAIN IT TAKES TIME TO PUT PARTNERSHIP TOGETHER. SO THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST A REALITY THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. ANOTHER SUGGESTION WAS THAT YOU NEED TO THINK OF THE I HAVE TO USE AS BEST USED AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND NOT AS A ONE OFF. FOR PROJECT LEVEL FINANCING BECAUSE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF. A FUNDING STRUCTURES AND IT DOES NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF ANY IFD CAN BE CUMBERSOME AND COSTLY BECAUSE OF JUST ADMINISTRATIVE TIME. PROJECT OVERSIGHT PROJECT FINANCING IN FUNDING TRACKING AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OUTCOMES. KNOW WE HAD TALKED IN THIS REGION WITH THE RAIL YARDS IT'S THE BIGGEST INFILL PROJECT WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DO ANY I HAVE DE THEIR FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING BROADBAND. AND YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS SO. I THINK THERE'S POTENTIAL BUT WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO PUT THESE PIECES TOGETHER. SO SOME OF OUR OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT. THE THE PROCESS CAN BE COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE. I THINK THAT THE ISSUE OF CAPACITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND AND THE IDEA THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME KIND OF CAPACITY TO JURISDICTIONS AND PARTNERS TO IMPLEMENT THESE TOOLS. WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL IN THIS IS WHERE PARTNERSHIP WITH. THE JURISDICTIONS AND THE WEEK GROUPS LIKE CAL LEAD WHICH HAVE ACTUALLY HAVE A FINANCING AUTHORITY TO COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. WE NEED TO CONSIDER MARKET CONDITIONS AND ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE WHEN MARKETS DOWNTURN AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THE TAX INCREMENT REVENUES AND HOW THAT MATCHES TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE. AND WHAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER HAVE CONSIDERATION FOR LONG TERM FINANCING OUT FOR PROJECTS BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL ON A LONG TERM TIME CYCLE. SO THE IDEA PARTNERSHIPS AND INVESTORS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR RURAL AREAS. THIS BURLY AREAS HIGH CAPACITY CHALLENGES BEFORE. REDEVELOPMENT EVER WENT AWAY. SO WE NEED TO CONSIDER TO THAT RURAL AREAS IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE INCLUDING THIS REGION CAN ALSO NOT USE MANY OF THE FINANCING TOOLS THAT THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDERAL AGENCIES BECAUSE OF WORLD DEFINITION ISSUES. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ABOUT TRYING TO LAYER MULTIPLE SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT'S REALLY BEEN A CONSTRAINT FOR US. SOME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING PROGRAMS DO HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE A CAPACITY BUILDING. AND I THINK IF WE COULD LEVERAGE SOME OF THOSE THAT WOULD BE VALUABLE VOTE WE MIGHT LOOK AT REPLICATING SOME OF THOSE TOOLS ON OUR OWN. OF FINANCING PROGRAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN RURAL AREAS WE CANNOT BUILD HOUSING COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES WITHOUT SOME CORE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING WATER AND SEWER AND WASTE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND BROADBAND. SO. AGAIN RURAL AREAS HAVE FURTHER CONSTRAINTS EVEN GET INTO THE REVITALIZATION AND REDEVELOPMENT PROCESS THESE ARE BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITIONS THAT ARE IN DIRE CONDITION IN MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. THERE WAS A NEW REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT FROM THE CENTER FOR REGIONAL CHANGE CHANGE YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE UP TO WATER CONDITIONS IN THIS AND WE CAN VALLEY. AND THAT'S A BARRIER TO USING ANY KIND OF THESE TOOLS BECAUSE THE BASELINE CONDITIONS ARE SO ARE ARE SO IMPAIRED. SO. JUST AS A FEW. OTHER INSIGHTS LAST IN THE LAST DECADE WE DID A LOT OF WORK WITH THE WITH THE CABINET AND THE US STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL LOOKING AT. KIND OF URBAN AND RURAL DISPARITIES IN DIFFERENCES IN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND. WE DO NEED TO CONSIDER AS A STATE THAT RURAL AREAS CONTINUE TO GROW LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA ADDED THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS AND. THE SOME OF THE RURAL COUNTIES ARE AMONG THE FASTEST GROWING COUNTIES IN THE STATE SO WE WE ALL HAVE AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THIS GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE WAY. THE HOUSING CHALLENGES WILL BE FURTHER EXACERBATED WITH THE IMPACT OF THE FIRES IN THE FLOODS IN THE OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS. AND SO WE NEED TO BE REALLY LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF HOW WE CAN ACCELERATE THE ABILITY OF THESE TOOLS TO HELP US RECOVER. AND BE RESILIENT IN TERMS OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. WE DO NEED TO THINK I THINK ABOUT THE. ADDRESSING EQUITY IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING FROM STATE LEVELS NOT JUST THROUGH THE. TAX INCREMENT TOOLS BUT OTHER KINDS OF BONDS AND AND PROGRAMS THEY OFTEN DISADVANTAGED RURAL AREAS IN TERMS OF THE ALLOCATION CRITERIA AND THE PROGRAM GUIDELINES WITH THINGS LIKE. MATCH REQUIREMENTS POPULATION THRESHOLDS AND EXCLUSION OF RURAL OR SMALLER COMMUNITIES. THAT THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US I THINK WE COULD ALSO LOOK AT. STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS LIKE CAP AND TRADE BOND MEASURES AND HOW THEY COULD BE LEVERAGED. SO THAT. THE INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE TO ADDRESS SOME INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT SOME CORE NEEDS CAN BE MET AND THEN THE COMMUNITIES CAN WORK ON. KIND OF THE VALUE AT AROUND REVITALIZATION PROJECTS I THINK PROVIDING CAPACITY BUILDING TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES AND ACCESSING IN LEVERAGE OF BEING THE FUNDING IN PUTTING. THE TI OF STRUCTURES IN PLACE WOULD BE REALLY VALUABLE ALONG WITH OTHER VEHICLES AND PARTNERSHIPS AYE UNLIKE THE IDEA OF THE. THE INVESTMENT VEHICLES THESE KIND OF MECHANISMS CAN HELP ALL COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK YOU KNOW IN THE PAST THERE UPSTATE PROGRAMS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT USE TO HAVE CIRCUIT RIDERS WHO WOULD GO OUT AND ASSIST RURAL COMMUNITIES AND PUTTING PROJECTS AND PROPOSALS TOGETHER. AND HELPING THEM GET READY TO TO PUT THE TOOLS IN PLACE SO I THINK THOSE KIND OF. MECHANISMS COULD BE LOOKED AT. AND I THINK THAT ANOTHER THING THE STATE COULD DO IS ADVOCATE FOR CHANGES IN RURAL DEFINITION WITH THEIR FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT WOULD UNLOCK A FUNDING SOURCE FOR US. NOT JUST FOR PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION FOR BUT THIS FOR CAPACITY BUILDING PEACE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE. CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT WHICH IS COMPRISED OF REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE WORKING ON. PROSPERITY AND OF HOUSING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. AS WELL AS SKILLS DEVELOPMENT THEY HAVE A NEW STRATEGY CALLED A WILL BE CALIFORNIA AND THEY REALLY ARE FOCUSED ON. WORLD PROSPERITY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RURAL CALIFORNIA'S NOT LEFT BEHIND SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE THAT A VERY GOOD PARTNER IN ADVANCING SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE. STRATEGIES AND PROPOSALS. AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY. INVESTING IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IN A BROADWAY INCLUDING IF WE COULD LEVERAGE SOME CAP AND TRADE MONEY WOULD HELP US MEET SOME OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS REDUCE. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IT'S AN ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR US TO USE OTHER KINDS OF. INFRASTRUCTURE. AND LASTLY THAT ARE RURAL AND URBAN AREAS ARE INTO JAPAN INTERDEPENDENT OUR LOCAL COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS HAS DONE RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT FOR EVERY JOB. IN THE OFF ON FIRM AREA IT GENERATES TWO JOBS OFFER SO WE ALL NEED TO RISE TOGETHER AND WE ALL HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN KEEPING RURAL CALIFORNIA STRONG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TRICIA DO HAVE A LITTLE. THIS KILLING SUSAN. SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT. REAL COMMUNITIES ARE AT THE TABLE. AND HOW. THE O. SEEMS LIKE MANY TIMES. WE'RE NOT THERE. AND HOW DO WE. CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER AGUIAR CURRY. I I BELIEVE THAT WORKING THROUGH LEADERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS LIKE C. SACK IN THE LEAGUE IN RC RC IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AND THEN PARTNERS LIKE VALLEY VISION THROUGH THE NETWORK OF CALIFORNIA STEWARDSHIP NETWORK. A WEEK THERE ARE A LOT OF INTERESTED PARTIES THAT WANT TO HELP AND THAT CAN HELP GET THE RURAL VOICE I THINK TO THE TABLE. AND I THINK WE DO NEED TO BE MINDFUL THOUGH. WE DON'T TRAVEL OUTLOOK TO OUR ROOM AREAS SO. YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT VOICE IS HEARD AND I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE WITH THE STATE AGENCIES AS WELL IN THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. FOR THAT ALIGNMENT AND. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY BY THE VOICE NEEDS TO DEFINITELY BE PRESENT. SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BUT. THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION IT'S CUT HIM MAYBE THINK ABOUT A FEW THINGS. YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT IS SOUTH WAS RIVERSIDE AND. NORTH INLAND SAN DIEGO SO IT'S KIND OF A MORE. RURAL AREA. BUT. THE ONE OF THE BIG CITIES THEY'RE ESCONDIDO. IS AN OLDER CITY INCORPORATED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE PIPES ON THE GROUND. ARE DEFINITELY OLDER INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REVITALIZATION AND. YOU KNOW EVEN WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO IT WE DEVELOPMENT YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING. AROUND THEIR SPECIALLY AROUND THE RAIL STATION. WITHOUT. WE'RE DOING ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE UNDER THE GROUND THE WATER AND THE SEWER. TOM WE'VE GOT POWER LINES THAT NEED TO BE UNDERGROUND LETS YOU KNOW MULTI MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHEN YOU JUST LOOK AT THAT ALONG AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING. TO GET US. IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE. DEVELOPMENT THE AREA BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE GET YOU KNOW WILLING PEOPLE COMING IN TO LOOK AT. REVITALIZATION EVERYONE WAS STOPPED AND TURNED AWAY BECAUSE OF THE COST OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE YOU KNOW. UPGRADING. BUT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE SOUTH OF THE GRAPEVINE WHICH ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS BEING IN SACRAMENTO IS. PEOPLE SELL WELL IN ORANGE COUNTY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR LA WELL WE'RE FURTHER. AND YOU KNOW. SAN DIEGO INLAND AND IMPERIAL EVEN ARE KIND OF THE BACK BURNER. WE HAVE. A LACK OF RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY SO IF WE WANNA START TALKING ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING AND ALL OF THESE THINGS OF THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. BEFORE YOU WE GO TOO FAR SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN GET TO THAT SO. I THINK. YOU KNOW THERE AT THE PROCESS EASIER WHEN WE DID THE BONDS IN THE LAST DECADE PEOPLE LOOKED AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE CREATES A COURSE OUR CROP ACROSS OUR CORE INFRASTRUCTURE SO. YOU'RE RIGHT EVERY TIME PEOPLE DIG INTO THE GROUND AND THEY GET LOOK AT THE CONDITION OF THINGS IT'S A BARRIER AND IT ADDS A LOT OF COSTS TO REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS SO. I THINK THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT THAT WE COULD BE LOOKING OUT HIS WATER NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED THAT WE CAN BUILD RESILIENCE INTO BUILDING SUPPLIES AND AND INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT DOUBLE. STANDARDS IN BETTER SAID IN THE FUTURE FOR RESILIENCE BECAUSE THESE THESE DISASTERS ARE POINTING OUT THAT THE NEED FOR RESILIENCE AND ARE PLANNING. AND I THINK FROM AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STANDPOINT WE TRY TO LOOK AT THAT AS DRIVERS OF INNOVATION AROUND NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESS SEASON. BUILDING MATERIALS THAT CAN ALSO BE MAY BE SOMETHING WITH THAT WE CAN BUILD OUR OWN. OUTLET MANUFACTURING AND OTHER SERVICES. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT YOU WATCHING THIS. CHANGES IN THE RURAL DEFINITION. CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN BECAUSE I THINK MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT IS A BARRIER FOR MANY OF US WHO. THERE FEDERAL AGENCIES ESPECIALLY YOU STA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE HAVE A LOT OF FUNDING FOR BROADBAND SEWER AND WATER FACILITIES HOUSING COMMUNITY FACILITIES BUT WE ARE LOCKED OUT OF THAT FUNDING. IN MOST OF OUR AREAS OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE. ARE TOO CLOSE TO URBAN OR METROPOLITAN AYE SERIOUS THOSE DEFINITIONS WERE DEVELOPED REALLY FOR THE MIDWEST WHERE. WERE OF RURAL AREAS OR. HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM CITIES THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR US SO WE HAVE WORKED WITH AGENCIES TO AT LEAST TRY TO GET SOME STANDARDIZED DEFINITE DEFINITION. OF IT AS SUCH AS RURAL IN CHARACTER SO A COMMUNITY LIKE WINTERS WOULD THEREFORE BE ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS THEN WE DON'T HAVE A FUNDING SOURCE WHICH OTHER COMMUNITIES RELY ON TO MEET THOSE GAPS SO. I'M VERY HAPPY TO SAY WE HAVE A NEW STATE DIRECTOR FOR USDA ARE RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA WHO COMES FROM COLUSA COUNTY AND SHE'S. VERYINTERESTED IN HELPING US WITH THIS ISSUE BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE ISSUE FOR THE STATE. DELEGATION TO BE ARE PROMOTING FOR US. BECAUSE OUT ENOUGH YEAH THAT'S PERFECT THANK YOU I THINK WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THAT. IS A BIG BARRIER FOR RURAL AREAS AND MAKE THEIR DEFINITIONS VARY BY FUNDING PROGRAMS TO WRITE SO THERE'S NOT A BEAUTY CONSISTENCY WITHIN THE AGENCIES. THE THINGS IS IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ONTO KREG CAST A LIVE CAST FOR THAT YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU HELPING ME OUT THERE. STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT WELCOME THANK YOU YES THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT HAS. REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. IN SOME CASES BEING DISPLACED BY REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY AND IN OTHER CASES BEING ASSISTED BY THE TAX INCREMENT FUNDS THAT FLOW TO THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. AND SO. I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE ON ON THAT TO THE PAST USE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING FUND. AND. AND HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE NOW AND HOW THAT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS GOING FORWARD. AND THE FIRST THING THAT. I PROVIDED AND HAND OUT WAS FROM THE. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING EMERGENCY THE HAND UP FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP CORPORATION JUST. CAME OUT AND. SEEMED APROPOS FOR REVIEW OF. DOES THE LOSS OF REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS BECAUSE ON PAGE THREE OF THAT REPORT. IS A CHART. IN TIED TO THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT AND THE LOSS OF STATE BOND FUNDING FOR HOUSING FORESHADOWED FOURTEEN PERCENT RISE IN HOMELESSNESS AND AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. AND THAT CHART. REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING WERE REDUCED THEY WERE ELIMINATED IT WAS ZERO. FROM A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO NONE. AND SO CUMULATIVELY. WE'VE LOST SOME SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE DIRECTED FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE THAT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EVERY YEAR. BECAUSE IT TO DO. DISSOLUTION ACT DOESN'T DIRECT ANY OF THE FUNDS TO GO FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. AND. SO THEN I'M I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE EXISTING TAX INCREMENT IS USED. STARTING WITH THAT I HAD THIS ONE PAGER. WHICH. WORKED WITH WOULD BETTER IN COLOR A HUFF. BUT IT IT DESCRIBES HOW. W. AS AS WE ALL KNOW. NO ONE PAGE OF TAX INCREMENT ALLOCATION BEFORE DISSOLUTION TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FUNDS WENT TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE FUNDS WERE AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. WITH GIVING LARGE JUST LARGE DISCRETION TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE LOCAL REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY OUGHT TO DECIDE. ARE BUT THE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING FUND HAVE HAD TO BE KEPT SEPARATELY FROM. THE GENERAL THE THE REMAINDER OF THE TAX INCREMENT. AND. A NUMBER OF AGENCIES DIDN'T EXPEND THOSE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING FUNDS THERE SOME LAW IN EXISTING COMMITTEE REDEVELOPMENT LAW ABOUT EXCESS SURPLUS. ON THE CAN ONLY. CREW SO MUCH OF THOSE FUNDS AND THEY HAVE TO BE EXPANDED BECAUSE COMMUNITIES WERE EXPENDING THEM. WELL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TIMES A BUDGET SHORTFALL WENT AND AND GRABS OF THIS FUNDS IN THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUN. AND. FUNDS THAT ARE KNOWN AS C. RAFFIN  <u><c.green>RAFT.</c></u> AND THE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DIDN'T TAKE KINDLY TO THEIR FUNDS BEING RAIDED AND THEY PASSED THE SPONSOR PROPOSITION TWENTY TWO IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. AND WHICH PROHIBITED THAT ACTIVITY BUT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IS THE CREDIT BUDGET CRISIS PERSISTED FOR CALIFORNIA. TWO BILLS WERE PASSED AB TWENTY SIX AND AB TWENTY SEVEN AB TWENTY SIX ELIMINATED REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES IN AB TWENTY SEVEN ALLOWED REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TO CONTINUE. PROVIDED THAT THEY MADE CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO CONTINUE TO ADD TO HELP BALANCE THE BUDGET. SORT OF CIRCUMVENTING PROP TWENTY TWO. THIS AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SAW IT THAT WAY AND STRUCK DOWN AB TWENTY SEVEN. AND SURPRISING TO ALL OBSERVERS INCLUDING THE PRACTITIONERS NOT ONLY. WE THOUGHT A FEW THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WOULD GO WAY WE LOSE SOME OF THE SLOWING MUCH FUND WE LOST A HUNDRED PERCENT OF IT. ALL FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN AGENCIES WERE ELIMINATED UNDER SCHEME THAT WAS NOT REALLY DESIGNED FOR STATE WIDE APPLICATION. AND IT DID SPAWN LITIGATION THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED CASES WERE BROUGHT. ONLY A HANDFUL OF THOSE CASES HAD TO DO IT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING THOUGH SO JUST A TINY FRACTION. HAD TO DO WITH HOUSING AND. ALL OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING FUNDS THAT WERE REMAINING WERE SWEPT. SO NONE OF THE THE REMAINING LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING FUNDS WERE LEFT SO WE ARE IN A SITUATION NOW IN THIS IS THE KIND OF SECOND. SLIDE THAT I HAVE OF WHERE ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS ARE BEING PAID BY THE BY THE SUCCESSOR AGENCIES EVERY YEAR THE SUCCESSOR AGENCIES CREATE A LIST OF IMPORTS OF OBLIGATIONS. AND TYPICALLY THE EIGHTY PERCENT CITE THE COMMERCIAL REDEVELOPMENT WITH. WAS SECURED TO BONDED INDEBTEDNESS AND THOSE BONDS HAVE PRIORITY ENTERED THE DISSOLUTION ACT IN THOSE BONDS ARE GENERALLY GETTING FUNDED. BUT FOR MOST AGENCIES THEY DIDN'T ENGAGE IN BONDING ON THE HOUSING SIDE THAT MONEY A CRUDE SAT. AND. GOT SWEPT AND NOW IT'S NO LONGER AN ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATION. SO WE CAN SEE IN THIS TREE IN THIS CHART WHERE MOST THAT EIGHTY PERCENT MONIES COVER TO ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS AND THAT BOOMERANG FUNDS THAT IS COMING BACK. SOME GOING TO THE SCHOOLS A BENEFITING STATE GENERAL FUND MOST OF THAT IS THE TWENTY PERCENT MONEY. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BEFORE THE DISSOLUTION LAW. AND SO BECAUSE THE THE THE ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT. HOUSING OBLIGATIONS WE'RE NOT PRINT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PROVIDING VERY VERY LITTLE FUNDING AT ALL. SO. WE. SOME REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TURNING TURNING OVER ARE IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY ACTUALLY DON'T GET ENOUGH. REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS THE REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTY TAX TRUST FUND AMOUNTS. TO PAY FOR THE EXISTING ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. AND THAT'S THOSE SUCCESSORS ARE UNDER WATER BUT THAT'S THE RARE CASE. MOST SUCCESSORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTY TAX TRUCK TRUST FUNDS TO ALLOCATE. AND. AND THOSE AMOUNTS ARE INCREASING FROM THE EXISTING PROJECT AREAS AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE ELIMINATED BUT THE PROJECT AREAS WERE NOT. THIS PROJECT AREAS CONTINUE TO DO TO GENERATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR AS NEEDED TO REPAY THE ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. BUT IT'S ALSO CREATING THESE OTHER FUNDS NONE OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BEING ALLOCATED FOR HOUSING. SO. I THINK BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE UNUSUAL WAY THAT WE ENDED UP pTHERE HASN'T BEEN. THE CAREFUL DEBATE AND DECISION MAKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS SCHEME WHERE NONE OF THE MONEY GOES FOR HOUSING IS THE SCHEME THAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED. SO. THAT'S THAT'S THE ESSENTIAL POINT THAT I WANTED TO. BRING TO THE COMMITTEE. THEY WERE HAVING QUESTIONS YEAH. COMMITMENTS. THANK YOU* ESCONDIDO HAD A VERY ROBUST LOW INCOME HOUSING PROGRAM. WE WON QUITE A FEW AWARDS FOR IT. AND WE ALSO USE OUR CD BG MONIES. TO HELP. OFFSET AND WE DEVELOP USING THAT FOR SOME OF THE SUPPORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ONE AROUND. BECAUSE WE WERE AN OLDER CITY WE WERE ABLE TO REALLY. ROOM MAKE AN IMPACT WITH INFILL HOUSING. AND IT WAS GREAT AND WE CAN ALSO GO IN AND RE DO ALTER. THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS BASICALLY AND CLEAN THE MOP AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS AS WE WENT INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD. AND WE HAD LOW INCOME HOUSING. DEVELOPERS YOU KNOW UP THERE TO WHAT WONDERFUL PROGRAM. THEY WOULD GO WHEN WE WILL CLEAN UP AREAS AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS WILL ALSO JOIN IN BUSINESSES WITH SPROUT UP NEIGHBORHOODS WITH STAR PAINTING IT'S JUST NOT ONLY AREA WE DID. IT REALLY EXPANDED BEYOND THAT SO IT'S BEEN SUCH A LOS. TO OUR CITIES TO NOT HAVE THAT ABILITY TO KEEP. KNOWN DOING ADS. IT'S MY COMMENT. BUT WHAT WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT IS THAT IT DOES THOSE PROJECT AREAS THAT WERE DEVELOPED. GENERATING THE TAX INCREMENT AND I DON'T KNOW ESCONDIDO SPECIFICALLY BUT IN GENERAL DOES PROJECT AREAS ARE ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP THE TAX INCREMENT. AND SO DOES FUNDS. COULD BE ALLOCATED. FOR CONTINUING BOTH. THE CITIES AS A TAXING ENTITY BUT ALSO THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT. HOW HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED? GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AS WELL. HIM GOOD AFTERNOON OF DOROTHY JOHNSON YOU. WELCOMES. NORTH REPRESENTS THE SEC THINK YOU ADD MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR MEMBER AYE DOROTHY JOHNS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING IN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE BEING INVITED TO BE PART OF. THIS INFORMATION HEREIN GIVING GIVEN THAT I COUNTIES ROLE IN DRIVING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OF COURSE THE PRESENCE STATE MY NEED FOR HOUSING SOLUTIONS SO WE'VE. WE'VE GOT IN DEEP ON A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND MY COMMENTS ARE GOING TO TAKE IT BACK UP ABOUT THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL. RHONDA AND REALLY I LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THESE TOOLS AND THE USE OF PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT FROM THE COUNTY'S PERSPECTIVE SO. WE OF COURSE BELIEVE THAT. COMMITTED ON THE TOOLS CAN BE USEFUL AND CLEAN UP REVITALIZATION AND INVESTMENT. ALONG WITH THE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT COUNTIES I DO PROVIDE TO THE SAME COMMUNITIES. KINDA GOING BACK TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE ONE A ONE A LITTLE THAT. SO PROPERTY TAX REVENUE WAS UP TWENTY PERCENT OF THE COUNTIES BUDGET I'M SECOND ONLY AFTER STATES OF PENSIONS IT IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF DISCRETIONARY FUNDING FOR COUNTY AND SO. IT'S OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND QUALITY LIFE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE AND IT'S NOT JUST OF COURSE TO RESIDENTS OF COUNTIES BUT THOSE SERVICES ALSO ARE PROVIDED TO RESIDENTS OF CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AS WELL. AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FUNDING SOURCES FOR FORMER REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND I FTA USER CREE AS ARE ALL THE OTHER NEW TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. THE PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT COULD BE CONSIDERED THE GOLD STANDARD RATE BECAUSE I IT WILL RELIABLY INCREASE OVER TIME AND THE COROLLARY IF YOU INVEST IN THAT PROPERTY IT WILL ALSO INCREASE. A THE THE ASSESSED VALUE. SO BECAUSE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE IS DISCRETIONARY IT'S RELIABLE. BUT THE LOCAL FUNDING SOURCE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND UNIQUE FOR THOSE THOSE REASONS. AMONGST OTHER COUNTY BOB REVENUE STREAM SO. AT THE TWO PRINCIPALS ARE CONCEPTS I WANT TO SHARE MAY SEEM VERY BASIC MAY SEEM OBVIOUS BUT THEY HAVE TO BE SAD IF THERE'S ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE USE. OF TAX INCREMENT IN PURSUING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT I COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE MUST ABSOLUTELY BE CONSENT AMONGST ALL PARTICIPATING AGENCIES ALL THE SERVICE PROVIDERS. OTHERWISE YOU ARE TRAINING CRITICAL REVENUE FROM ONE AGENCY FORSAKING THEIR INVESTMENT FOR ANOTHER. I. AND THE CONCERN ABOUT COMPELLED PARTICIPATION. WHEN YOU'RE TELLING THE PUBLIC TAX INCREMENT INTERLOCKING AND ONE AGENCIES FUNDING LEVEL. FOR DECADES POTENTIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL PROGRAM DEMANDS AND POPULATION CHANGES WELL INTO THE FUTURE AND SO HOW CAN I COUNTY MEET THOSE CHANGING NEEDS OVER TIME. GIVEN SUCH LIMITED REVENUE AUTHORITY IN OTHER AREAS. AS MY COLLEAGUE DAN CARRIED FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES MENTIONED A SEVENTY PERCENT A COUNTIES ARE RECEIVING LESS PROPERTY TAX TODAY THAN THEY WERE PRE GREAT RECESSION. THAT'S PRETTY STARLINGS OVER THREE FOURTHS OF COUNTIES. AND THE SECOND PRINCIPLE WE WANT TO SPEAK TO IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY REPORTING TO STATE AGENCIES OR ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT BODIES. BUT IT'S THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO ARE INVESTING THOSE RESIDENTS DOLLARS INTO PROJECTS AND MAKING SURE. THAT IF A LOCAL AGENCY IS COMMITTING TAX INCREMENT OR IN SOME INSTANCES PERHAPS SALES TAX TOT WHATEVER REVENUES ON THE TABLE. THEY OF THE MECHANISMS TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS. UNTIL THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT AREAS ARE USING. THE NEWER TOOLS YEAH AFTER HE'S CREE AS X. THAT ARE. AND WHY HAVEN'T MORE BEEN USING A AND YES I WILL WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE THEY'RE VERY NO. SEE SACK HAS BEEN WORKING WITH OUR COUNTIES TO EDUCATE THEM ON WHAT IS AND ISN'T ALLOWABLE PERMISSIBLE. WORKING WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANTS HOLD WEBINARS AND SHARE WHAT IS YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY ON THE TABLE FOR COUNTIES. BUT I WILL ALSO AND SAY IN ADDITION TO IT BEING VERY NEW THERE IS ALSO STILL SOME OF THAT. POSTER MATIC STRESS FROM RDA DISSOLUTION. AND THE IDEA OF TRUST OF WHAT ARE WE GETTING OURSELVES INTO HOW LONG EVERY TYING THE HANDS OF THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS OF OUR OF OUR COUNTY. ON IN ONE OF THESE. PROGRAMS. AND IN TERMS OF OTHER COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW COUNTIES ARE COMPETING FOR FUNDING FROM THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMITTEES PROGRAM. AND STATE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVOKE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND OF COURSE SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE AREAS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE KNOW STATE FUNDING SOURCES ARE MASSIVELY OVERSUBSCRIBED THIS IS AT THE SAME TIME WHEN FEDERAL FUNDING. IS DECREASING TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS. AND SO AND RESPONSE ACCORDINGLY WE'VE SEEN LOCAL SOLUTIONS FOR SPECIAL FUNDING TO BE PURSUED BY THE RATS. OF BONDS OF WHETHER IT'S A. PORTION OF LOCAL TO UT I'M FINDING OTHER WAYS TO GROW THE PIE SIMPLY THAN PEELING AWAY FROM THE PROPERTY TAX BASE. AND YOU KNOW WHILE THESE INVESTMENTS ARE PROMISING. THERE ARE STILL AGAIN THOSE VERY HIGH VOTER THRESHOLDS THAT MAKE THEM LESS ATTAINABLE. AND SO. THE THE UNFORTUNATE THING HERE TOO IS THAT THE ALTERNATIVE A TO ALTERNATIVE AGAIN RELYING ON PARTY TAX INCREMENT. IS THAT THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY IMPEDE DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S A STUDY FROM THE TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION. FROM JUST EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT SAID BY REDUCING REVENUES AVAILABLE FROM POPPY TAXES IT SIMPLY PUT INCREASING PRESSURE ON DEVELOPMENT FEES. AND A CURRENT FINANCING SYSTEM THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON NEW DEVELOPMENT TO FUND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE DRIVES UP THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT AND AYE EXACERBATES THE HOUSING SHORTAGE. SO YOU KNOW IN CLOSING I AM I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT. DIVERTING PROPERTY TAX REVENUES AS MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS SEEK TO DO AND LUCKILY WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES. IT MAY HELP HIGHLY LOCALIZED PROGRAMS BUT WE NEED TOO AT ALL COSTS ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. ESPECIALLY FOR AGENCIES WERE CHARGED WITH DOING SO MUCH MORE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CRIMINAL JUSTICE. WHETHER THE COUNTY A SPECIAL DISTRICT WHAT WHAT MAY BE WE NEED TO ENSURE THERE IS CONSENT AND PARTICIPATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY AT ALL LEVELS SO UP WITHOUT THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BEEN. GIVEN QUESTIONS. WHY YOU OFFICE GOT FREED HIS HEAD? I'M LIKE YOU KNOW THE COMMENT THAT I MAKE IS I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE THE COUNTIES FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE AND HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. AND TRYING TO GET PETITIONS RURAL AREAS TO SIT AND ACTUALLY COLLABORATE ON BIG PROJECTS. SOMETIMES A REALLY DIFFER BECAUSE THEY'RE SO LARGE IN THERE SO CUMBERSOME SO MEGACE IN SOME AREAS WHERE THEY WOULD WORK A LOT BETTER YOU KNOW MAYBE SAN FRANCISCO YOU'RE ALL ONE COUNTIES CITY BUT. IN SOME WAS TO HAVE THOSE LARGER DISTRICTS I CAN SEE. IT'S GOING TO BE A HARD SELL MAYBE NEED TO CALL SOMETHING ELSE I DON'T KNOW. BUT THINK OF A NEW ACRONYM FOR IN THE NEW ACRONYMS IT ASSISTS IN. EXACTLY. THAT'S ALL I HAVE BEEN LAND. NO GREAT I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR. FOR YOUR THOUGHTS AND AND PLEASE. FEEL FREE TO PROVIDE US WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. AND OTHER IDEAS AND SO YOU'RE CONTINUES ARE ONE OPEN IT UP AT THIS TIME TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE PANEL IF YOU'D LIKE TO. EXCUSE YOURSELF YOU'RE YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO THAT.
