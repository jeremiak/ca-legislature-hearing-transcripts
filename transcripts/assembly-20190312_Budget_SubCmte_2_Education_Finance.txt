THE FAMILY BUDGET COMMITTEE. NUMBER TWO ON EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY IS OUR K. TWELVE HEARING SPECIFICALLY ON THE L. C. F. F. -- SPENDING PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- AS WELL AS OUR STATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WILL ALSO HEAR ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO HELP PROVIDE PENSION RELIEF FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND LASTLY WE'LL HEAR FROM MIKE FINE WITH THICK MATS ON THE FISCAL STATUS OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE KINDA. UNFORTUNATELY GLOSSED OVER YOUR YOUR WORK -- MIKE FIND IT FAKE MATT BUT AS WE KNOW. SACRAMENTO LA AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THIS IS AN ISSUE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE EVERY YEAR BUT ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR. AND OF COURSE WE WENT -- TO I KNOW MISTER MARTZ WHICH IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT AND THE PROPOSAL WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE TALK ABOUT. THE OVERALL FISCAL HEALTH OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WHAT'S NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS A WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE THE GOVERNOR'S NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PROPOSAL RELATED TO THE LOCAL CONTROL. FUNDING FORMULA AND WOOD WHEN A CALL OF TERMINA FINANCE DELEO. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND IF YOU COULD PRESENT IN THAT ORDER THANK YOU LOOK AT THE END. I'M THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU. DÃ¢N HAND OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY INCLUDES A TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND INCREASE FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THIS INCREASE REFLECTS A THREE POINT 46% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. AND A POINT 12% DECLINE IN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. OVERALL THIS BUDGET BRINGS TOTAL LCF FUNDING. OCTOBER I'LL SEE IF OF FUNDING TO SIXTY THREE BILLION. TO TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND BRINGS THE TOTAL OF NEW ON GOING FUNDING SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE RECEIVED. SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN TO TWENTY THREE BILLION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL NINE MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO REFLECT A THREE POINT 46% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. AN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE CHANGES UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. INCLUDING THE MINIMUM STATE AID THIS BRINGS TOTAL I'LL SEE ABOUT FUNDING FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISM WHEREBY THE ADMINISTRATION CAN ASSESS THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE COLA ON THE ALSO. ON THE CFF IN THE BUDGET YEAR WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE. IN ALL OTHER SPENDING PRIORITIES AN AUTOMATIC ALTERNATIVE CALL THE TO THE FORMULA IF NECESSARY WITH THAT I'D BE A HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU HELLO. GOOD MORNING RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LA NOW. THE COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. WE CONTINUE TO THANK THE LC FF HAS A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES OVER ALTERNATIVE FINANCE SYSTEMS BUT SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES -- NEW FORMULA THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CAP -- THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR L. C. F. F.. AND WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL BUT WE THINK THE FACT THAT THIS PROPOSALS BEING PUT FORWARD IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE CHANGE WE MADE LAST YEAR WHICH CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATES THEY'LL SEE IF OF COLA. IS NOT GONNA BE ACTIONABLE AND ALL BUT SHOULD YEARS IN SOME CASES YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO FUND THE FULL STATUTORY COLA. WE THINK THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO OF RECOGNIZE THAT REALITY IS JUST TO RETURN TO THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM OF PROVIDING THESE AUGMENTATIONS ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS RATHER THAN. ESTABLISHING YET ANOTHER FORMULA THAT MAKES THE BUDGET PROCESS LESS TRANSPARENT AND HARDER -- FOR FOLKS TO FOLLOW TING FORMULA AND SPECIFICALLY THE MINIMUM STATE AID PROVISION. I'M JUST REAL BRIEFLY HERE PRIOR TO A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN ONE PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS INCREASED FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THEIR STATE A DECREASE DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WE DON'T ALLOW. COUNTY OFFICES TO RECEIVE HIGHER LEVELS OF FUNDING JUST BASED ON THEIR PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS THE MINIMUM STATE AID PROVISION. PUTS A CAP ON HOW MUCH WE CAN REDUCE STATE FUNDING WHEN THOSE PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS INCREASE CONSEQUENTLY THERE'S INCREASING DISPARITY BETWEEN -- HOW COUNTIES ARE FUNDED BASED SOLELY ON HOW MUCH PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THEY'RE COLLECTING? OUT WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE INEQUITIES WE ALSO THINK THERE ARE BETTER USES OF THE NOW OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT ARE GOING TO THIS FUNCTION BUT WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN THAT THE A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE FULL COST OF THIS PROVISION. RIGHT NOW THEY THEY DON'T ACTUALLY PROJECT THE COSTS GOING FOR THE JUST HOLD THEM FLAT EVEN THOUGH THE INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR WE WE THANK. WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RIGHT NOW THERE'S FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF AS YET UNACCOUNTED FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MINIMUM STATE A PROVISION. AND GIVEN THAT THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM WITHIN THEIR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE -- FOR THIS ADDITIONAL SPENDING THIS IS SOMETHING WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KIND JACKSON -- DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND. WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH PROPOSES TO FULLY FUND THE LC FF STATUTORY COLA. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WE FURTHER APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S ONGOING COMMITMENT TO THE LC FF AND EDUCATIONAL AND INVESTMENTS AS EVIDENCED BY FULLY FUNDING THE LC A FAT IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. WITH THAT THIS FULLY FUNDED THIS YEAR. WE DO STILL CONSIDER THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO BE A TRANSITION YEAR SINCE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STILL RECEIVING THE FINAL INSTALLMENT. OF GAP FUNDING. AS SUCH SOME COMPONENTS OF LCF AT SUCH AS INSTRUCTIONAL TIME REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE UNTIL -- NINETEEN TWENTY AND NOW THAT THE L. SAFE WILL BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE FUNDING BEYOND BASED GRANT RATES. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS. MR DONE I HAVE A COMMENT YEAH -- I WOULD SAY THAT FULLY FUNDING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ORPHALI FUNDING LCF ISN'T FULLY FUNDING THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. I THINK WE'RE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN A HEARING IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW AND HAD. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE DONE IT IN IN IN. IN TREATING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AS THE CEILING. AND I THINK THIS BODY. THE OUR GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS MAKE A MUCH STRONGER COMMITMENT. THE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BY FUNDING WELL ABOVE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT LEVEL SO I JUST I I GET WORRIED WHEN PEOPLE COME ON THE WE HAD OUR SELVES LACKS A WHILE WE FULLY FUNDED NINETY EIGHT THIS YEAR. AND LOOK WHERE WE ARE IN. YOU KNOW THE FUNDING LEVELS WILL MAKE AS COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND ASKING HER TO THE COMMITMENT WE NEED. AND THE INVESTMENT WE NEED TO MAKE IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SO THAT A TURN ABOUT GENES YEAH WELL THAT'S A GREAT COMMENT -- MISTER O'DONNELL AND I WANT TO TURN THAT INTO SOME QUESTIONS AND SO. I I FULLY CONCUR THAT WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB THAT. FULLY FUNDING THE TARGETS THAT WE LAID OUT IN HOW MUCH MONEY WE PUT INTO THE ARE PROP NINETY EIGHT EDUCATION -- BUDGET THE LAST -- FIVE YEARS ESSENTIALLY INCREASING FUNDING BY ROUGHLY CALIFORNIA BUT AS YOU JUST NOTED -- EDUCATION CHERYL DONALD THAT WE'RE STILL YOU KNOW WOEFULLY FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS COMPARED IT. STATES ACROSS THE NATION. AND YOU KNOW WITHOUT GETTING TO THE NUMBER WE'RE AT WE'RE NOW WE'RE WE'RE NO WE'RE CLEARS NUMBER NEAR THE TOP NEAR NO NO WORK NO NOR ARE WE AT THE MIDDLE. AND I WANTED TO ASK TO THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU THINK OUR SCHOOLS ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED. AND IF NOT -- WHAT'S THE PLAN -- TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE PUBLIC SCHOOL FUNDING TO GET CLOSER TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AT THIS POINT THE END WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE WOULD NOTE THAT I WASN'T WHEN I ASKED RECYCLING. DOESN'T A PROMINENT FINANCE THINK THAT. OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL. IN CALIFORNIA ADEQUATELY FUNDED. AND IF NOT. WHAT'S THE PLAN. TO GET THERE. ERIN AT A AT APARTMENT OF FINANCE AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FIRST AND FOREMOST AND WE WOULD NOTE -- THAT THIS BUDGET REALLY MAKES AN ATTEMPT TO PRIORITIZE BUDGET RESILIENCY AND FUNDING A WITHIN THE PROPOSITION MINIMUM PROPOSITION NINETY MINIMUM GUARANTEED TO BE ABLE TO GET -- ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WE CAN TO SCHOOLS -- WITH IN THAT AND WITHIN THE CERTAINLY THE THE STATE GENERAL FUND. REVENUES THE STATE OF CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS THERE -- I WOULD NOTE THAT SINCE THE TROUGH OF THE RECESSION WE'VE GONE FROM JUST OVER FORTY SEVEN BILLION IMPROPER NINETY EIGHT TO OVER EIGHTY BILLION NOW -- SCHOOLS OF RECEIVE LIKE MY COLLEAGUES SAID MORE SEE OF PFAFF -- THEY'RE JUST DISCRETIONARY FUNDING AS WELL -- IN ALL THE BUDGETS FROM -- FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THROUGH THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET WERE SCHOOLS HAVE RECEIVED OVER SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF DISCRETIONARY FUNDING SO CERTAINLY THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION AND THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE. OUR FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS -- AND GETTING COULD CERTAINLY INCREASING THAT RANKING AS WELL AND THAT WILL BE REFLECTED I GET ALL THAT AND THAT'S IN A LONGER VERSION OF WHAT I SAID EARLIER IN MY STE MY STATEMENT THAT WE'VE. COME A LONG WAY AND RESTORED FUNDING IN THIS. PLAN BEFORE US DOES I THINK WITHIN THAT BUDGET CLIMATE. PUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS AND LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO HELP DISTRICTS BACKGROUND TALK ABOUT THE PENSION BUT DO WE THINK AND OUT OF THE GOVERNOR IS THAT STRONG EDUCATION CHAMPION HE RAN EDUCATION THAT'S THAT'S HIS THAT'S HIS BIG FOCUS IS PUBLIC EDUCATION. DO WE THINK THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A POSITION ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S A DIFFICULT -- WORD I THINK TO TO DEFINE I THINK WE WOULD SAY WE'RE DOING -- WHAT WE CAN TO PRIORITIZE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE EDUCATION FUNDING WITHIN THE BUDGET? THIS ORDER I THAT AGAIN MISTER DON NOT HONORABLY GET THIS AND I THINK. HE HE APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE IT WAS A TOUGH QUESTION BY WE HANDLE THAT VERY WELL -- BUT I I THINK YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN BLAME THE GOVERNOR WE APPOINT THE GOVERNOR AND ON YOUR BLAME THE GOVERNMENT APPOINT THE GOVERNOR ALSO THINK THIS BODY THE LEGISLATURE PLAYS A ROLE IN THIS EXERCISE. TO WEAR AND THEY ARE -- YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES RUN AND SAY THEY'RE ALL FOR EDUCATION FUNDING IN ADEQUATELY YEAH WHEN IT COMES SO IN TIME. FOR THE BUDGET YOU KNOW WE NEED TO WE AND I THINK THAT'S IN ORDER TO BE PART SO BACK TO THAT BUT BUT AGAIN WROTE YEAH. I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE GOVERNOR -- BUT HE DID A GOOD JOB AGAIN FORGET -- BUT YOU KNOW IT IT ALSO SPEAKS TO OUR PRIORITIES TO IN THIS LEGISLATURE'S NEEDS TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR A BIT. TO SEE WHAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE BECAUSE OFTEN THEY LIVE WELL OUTSIDE. OF THE EDUCATION ARENA. YET AND SO WHAT WITH THAT AND WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION BE OPEN TO OF OF COURSE YOU WERE SAYING IF WE CAN. REDIRECT MONIES FROM THE EXISTING STATE BUDGET FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WHAT HAVE YET. TO POTENTIALLY -- EDUCATION. IN A WORLD WILL DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN THERE BUT YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY SQUEEZING SO MUCH OUT YOU KNOW OF THE AND REALLOCATING THE THE PIE THERE. AS FAR AS GROWING THE PIPE HE WITH THE MINISTRATION BE OPENED ITS SETTING MORE. ROBUST OUT YEAR TARGETS FOR L. C. F. F. LIKE WE DID WITH THE FIRST ROUND. KIND OF LIKE AND AND ASPIRATE. BECAUSE I THINK RIGHT NOW WITH THEIR WORDS FEW NOW THAT. LOWER EXPECTATIONS AS FAR AS FUNDING OUR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS IMMERSING IT. I THINK GIVEN THAT THEIR WE HAVEN'T SEEN A YOU KNOW A FINALIZED RIPPLES ON THAT YET I I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GIVE A POSITION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION -- BUT CERTAINLY THAT CAN BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD AS WE GO A CONTINUE TO GO INTO THE SPRING AND THEN A REVISION [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU AND NOW THAT CERTAINLY AT A PRIORITY OF THE OF THE ASSEMBLY AND WE'RE LOOKING AT REVENUE -- OPTIONS TO ADEQUATELY FUND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT ADDITION. WHILE WE'RE GETTING THERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SET A MARKER THE SPARE WEEK AS FAR AS WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT. HAS A GREAT IMPACT ON OUR CLASSROOMS AND CONSTRUCTION IN AND TRYING -- TO ADDRESS OUR ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN EQUITY ISSUES FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT SO AS FAR AS EQUITY. ISSUES LAST YEAR AS YOU KNOW WE WE WERE ABLE TO PUT IN THE BUDGET ONE TIME MONEY FOR THIS -- LOW PERFORMING SUBGROUP FOR L. C. F. F.. AND THE MONIES ARE RIGHT NOW. GOING OUT TO DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND I WANTED TO ASK THAT. TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES -- POSITION THAT WAS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BUT IT'S NOT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. GOOD MORNING AMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I MEAN IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE LOW PERFORMING STUDENT BLOCK GRANT THAT WAS BUILT IN -- AS PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT -- AGAIN THAT WAS ONE TIME -- WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS THIS YEAR -- ANOTHER IT'S A BILL MOVING FORWARD -- THAT WOULD WOULD PROVIDE MORE OF AN ONGOING INVESTMENT AND WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL ON THAT AT THIS TIME BUT I I WANTED TO NOT YOU KNOW PRE JUDGE WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FORTY ONE INTO IT AGAIN. BUT BASED UPON. WHERE LITTLE OVER -- THREE COURT ALMOST THREE QUARTERS THROUGH.% THE THE BUDGET YEAR HOW'S IT GOING SO FAR AND IS IS THAT -- IT IS A GUY THE MONEY'S GOING OUT AND DO WE KNOW -- HOW THE EFFORTS ARE GOING ACROSS I'M IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE IN AND GETTING THE SPENDING OUT I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION? HIS CONCERN IMPLEMENTING THAT THAT BLOCK GRANT -- I DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF THAT EFFORT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER EFFORTS THAT WE'LL HEAR ABOUT I THINK IN THE THIRD PANEL AROUND THE ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE. AND THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO HELP DISTRICTS IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES PARTICULARLY THOSE TIME STUDENT GROUPS THAT ARE LOW PERFORMING. OKAY. MISTER JACKSON DO YOU WANNA TAKE A CRACK ABSENCE [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT IS -- IMPLEMENTING -- THE LOW PERFORMING STUDENT STUDENT GRANT -- THERE WERE -- LAST A LOOK TO THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY. FIFTEEN HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN -- OF APPROVED OR HAVE SUBMITTED THEIR APPLICATION THERE'S LESS THAN. A HUNDRED THAT HAVE OPTED OUT OF THE PROGRAM ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT IS STILL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION -- PHASE OF THAT WE WE ARE -- FUNDS WILL BE GOING OUT THAT DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD HAVE ANY. INFORMATION BACK BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT THE BUDGET PROCESS. POTENTIALLY THERE'S A DESIRE TO RE UP THAT AND DO THAT AGAIN AND CERTAINLY LIKE TO HAVE SOME. FEEDBACK ON YOUR ONE IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT WITH RESPECT TO DATA IN TERMS OF HOW MANY DISTRICTS ACTUALLY SUBMITTED SUBMITTED THEIR PLAN OR PROVE MET THE DEADLINES EXCEPT FOR WE COULD -- PROVIDE PROVIDE THAT I WOULD NEED TO GET BACK WITH OUR STAFF IN TERMS OF A OF A TIME LINE BUT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT SIR OKAY. THANK YOU TO THE LA -- ANYBODY COMMENTS ON THIS ON THIS -- ALSO FROM LAST YEAR -- I I I THINK THAT WE WOULD -- CAUTION AGAINST ADOPTING THE SAME APPROACH THAT WAS TAKEN LAST YEAR -- WITH REGARDS TO THE LOW PERFORMING STUDENT BLOCK GRANT AS IT WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE HAD TWO PRIMARY CONCERNS. ONE WAS THAT -- WHILE WE THINK THAT THERE'S MERIT AND THE LC OF SUCH AS GENERAL APPROACH OF SAYINGS FOR INSTANCE THE POPULATION HAVE LARGER EDUCATIONAL DEFICITS AND ADDRESSING THOSE DEFICITS WILL REQUIRE. MORE RESOURCES -- THAT IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF AN ONGOING LONG STANDING PROBLEM THAT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE BEST DRESSED THROUGH ONE TIME FUNDING. I HAD IF YOU WERE TO MAKE THE LOW PERFORMING STUDENT BLOCK GRANT. ON GOING WE WOULD STILL HAVE A CONCERN WITH THAT SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION OF THAT GRANT. WAS TIED TO INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS WHO DID NOT MEET STANDARDS ON THE STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS OF READING AND MATH. WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT THAT CREATES A CAN GE THOSE STUDENTS TO ACTUALLY MEET THOSE STANDARDS PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE PROVIDING A LARGE DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR EVERY STUDENT WHO'S. IN ONE OF THESE ELIGIBLE GROUPS THAT'S NOT MEETING THE STANDARDS WE WE THINK THAT. THE INCENTIVE WOULD BE MISALIGNED WITH THE POLICY A PROPOSAL SO WE WE WOULD RECOMMEND MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU THIS SECTION WAS INFORMATIONAL. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. TWO RELATED. TO PENSIONS AND THEY EFFORTS. TO AB SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT THEY'RE PENSION COSTS RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU RESTART AGAIN WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LA JOH AND THEN CASTERS. GOOD MORNING AGAIN MR CHAIR AN IMMEDIATE APARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF PRESENTATION ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE. A TOTAL OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN RELIEF FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ALSO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. TO CAL STARS. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO AGAIN REITERATE THE INCREASES THAT SCHOOLS HAVE RECEIVED OVER THE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN UNDER THE CFF LIKE I MENTIONED TWENTY THREE BILLION OF NEW ONGOING MONEY -- NOW THROUGH TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY PROPOSED BUDGET AND THEN ALSO THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO THE FORMULA THAT REPRESENTS A THREE POINT 46% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT -- ON TOP OF THE MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF BILLION THAT. WE PUT INTO THE ELF YOURSELF LAST YEAR TO REACH FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN THE LAST YEAR OF TRANSITION AS THE CD THERE'S A DEPARTMENT OF ED -- MENTIONED HOWEVER MISTER CHAIR THAT MANY DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE CONTINUING TO GRAPPLE WITH THE RISING FIST COCKED FIX COSTS THAT THEY HAVE. IN DIFFICULT BUDGET DECISIONS AS THEY REALLY ALL WORK TOWARDS IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS MATTER WHAT. THE BACKGROUND MIGHT BE ADDITIONALLY. BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL MONIES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE LC A FAST AT THE MERE VISION BEYOND THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. ON LIKE IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT IN MORE RECENT YEARS WHEN WE HAD A LARGE SURGES IN REVENUES -- FROM GOING FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO THE MAYOR VISION TIMELINE -- THAT IS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE FUNDING. FIRST SCHOOLS -- IN RECOGNITION. OF THIS REALITY. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO TAKE AVAILABLE ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY RESOURCES WITHIN THE BUDGET. AND APPLY THEM IN A WAY THAT WE FEEL WILL BE THE BEST. BENEFITS. OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD FOR SCHOOLS. A SPECIFICALLY THE BUDGET IS PROPOSING LIKE I SAID A THREE BILLION DOLLAR -- INFUSION OF MONIES INTO THE CAL HALF OF EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE RATE REALLY FOR THEM. APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THIS WILL GO OUT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS WHICH WILL EQUAL ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EACH YEAR -- BEING NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE EFFECTIVELY REDUCING EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES BY IN NINETEEN TWENTY TAKING EMPLOYERS FROM EIGHTEEN POINT 1% TO SEVENTEEN POINT 1%. AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAKING THEM FROM NINETEEN POINT 1% CONTRIBUTION RATE TO EIGHTEEN POINT 1%. AFTER THAT THE REMAINING APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WILL GO TOWARDS PAYING DOWN THE LONG TERM UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND THAT IS ESTIMATED TO EQUAL POINT 5% REDUCTION IN EACH FUTURE YEAR FOR CONTRIBUTION RATES BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FOR A TOTAL ESTIMATED SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY SIX POINT NINE BILLION THROUGH TWENTY FORTY SIX THE LIFE OF THE CURRENT CASTERS FUNDING PLAN -- WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY. THANK YOU LA L.. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR KENNETH COUPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE HAVE A HAND OUT THAT -- AND I WON'T COVER ALL OF THE BACK ON IN THE HEARTS BUT TURNING TO PAGE TWO AND KIND OF BY WAY OF BACKGROUND. IS ONE OF THE TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHARACTERS FUNDING PLAN STATE ADOPTED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW -- CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARACTERS FROM STATES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR BENEFITS AS TEACHERS HAVE EARNED THEM FOR MOST OF CHARACTERS HISTORY. AND BY THE EARLY TWENTY TENS THAT. UNDER FUNDING HAD REACHED A CRITICAL POINT WITH THE SYSTEM PROJECTED TO RUN OUT OF ASSETS BY THE MID TWENTY FORTY IS -- AND THE LEGISLATURE -- SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THAT ISSUE HAD A LOT OF HEARINGS TALKED ABOUT. SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES FOR ADDRESSING THAT SHORTFALL SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. I'M NOT LOTS OF DISCUSSION. AND THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THIS. PLAN THAT WAS INTENDED TO ELIMINATE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES BY THE MID TWENTY FORTY IS. I THINK THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO REALLY ILLUSTRATES HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT PLAN WAS. IN MOVING CAL STIRS FROM INTRODUCTORY WHERE IT WAS. GOING TO RUN OUT OF FUNDING WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES TO INTRODUCTORY WHERE IT COULD ACHIEVE FULL FUNDING. BY THE MID TWENTY FORTY IS -- TURNING TO PAGE THREE AS YOU. I HEARD OF THE THE PLAN REALLY IS. A THIRTY YEAR PLAN AND SO PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY BEING ONLY FIVE YEARS INTO IT. THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY TODAY IS IT IS STILL LARGE IT'S OVER A HUNDRED BILLION -- AT AS OF THIS POINT THE PLANET SO SIX ABOUT ONE THIRD TO THE STATE THE SIX CHAIRS AND KIND OF FLUCTUATE OVER TIME -- BUT IT'S STILL YOU KNOW IT'S STILL A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE -- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION BETWEEN THE PAGE FOR GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH RATES AND COSTS LATELY I DISTRICT COST SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PLAN HAVE GROWN A LITTLE OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THROUGH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THE ADDITIONAL INCREASE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS WILL BE ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION -- THAT'S FAIRLY CLOSE TO OUR OWN ESTIMATES OF HOW MUCH DISTRICT COSTS WOULD INCREASE -- ONE SORT OF AN IMPORTANT POINT I MEANT MIGHT MENTION IS THAT EVEN THOUGH ALL EMPLOYERS ARE PAYING THE SAME RATE THE COST TO VARY A LITTLE BIT AROUND THE STATE FROM DISTRICT TO DISTRICT. BECAUSE DISTRICTS MAKE DIFFERENT DECISIONS ABOUT THE LOCAL PAPER ALL. DISTRICTS SOME DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN GRANTING LARGER OR SMALLER SALARY INCREASES SOME OF AN INCREASING SALARY MORE OR LESS THAN OTHER DISTRICTS. AND SO THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE HAD THEIR PAYROLL GROW MORE QUICKLY HAVE ALSO SEEN A PENSION COSTS GO MORE QUICKLY. I'M PAGE FIVE I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION I GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL. I THINK. ONE POINT WE MIGHT EMPHASIZES THAT ALTHOUGH. THE TWO PROPOSALS ARE VERY EASY TO LUMP TOGETHER THE OBJECTIVES FOR EACH REALLY. QUITE DIFFERENT THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION REALLY IS ALL ABOUT DISTRICT BUDGET RELIEF -- KIND OF BY DESIGN IT'S NOT INTENDED AND IF MAKE MORE OR LESS PROGRESS TOWARDS A PAYING DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. OF THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION THOUGH THAT REALLY IS ABOUT THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. IT LETS THE STATE TAKE ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS FULL FUNDING OF THE PLAN. AND IT DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE RATES DISTRICT RATES STARTING IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT THE LIGHT THE LIGHT MOST OF THOSE SAVINGS ARE REALLY IN THE LONG TERM IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT SORT OF IMMEDIATE. BUDGET RELIEF UNLIKE THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION. SO TURNING TO PAGE SIX I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS THAT CHARACTERS HAS BEEN THIS SORT OF DIFFICULT CONVERSATION FOR YOU THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. THAT THE DISTRICT RATE IS ALREADY OUT ABOUT 16% THAT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE WHERE IT WAS BEFORE THE START OF THE HEALTHCARE SPENDING PLAN. THAT BUT DESPITE THAT INCREASE -- THE DISTRICT RATE STILL. ISN'T HIGH ENOUGH AT THIS POINT TO ACHIEVE THE FULL FUNDING OBJECTIVES THAT YOU SET FORTH THE SPENDING PLAN. AND SO I THINK THE QUESTION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PUTS BEFORE YOU ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT WHETHER THE DISTRICT GREAT -- SHOULD GO UP OR NOT BUT WINDOW WHAT THE TIMING OF THAT INCREASE SHOULD BE AND WHEN THOSE INCREASES SHOULD OCCUR. DISTRICTS ARE LIKELY TO SEE RATE INCREASES AS CHALLENGING IN VIRTUALLY ANY FISCAL ENVIRONMENT WE CAN IMAGINE. BUT AS YOU THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTION THE STATE RIGHT NOW IS IN THE MIDST OF A OF A VERY STRONG ECONOMIC TIES IN THIS SCHOOL FUNDING HAS GROWN TWENTY TWO BILLION THE PAST -- SIX YEAR IS THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED ANOTHER TWO POINT NINE BILLION INCREASE FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION ON A PER PUPIL BASIS FUNDING IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. AND SO AN ALTERNATIVE WE WANT TO SKETCH OUT IS TO SET ASIDE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION NOW FOR RELIEF BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY USE THAT TO LOWER DISTRICT CONTRIBUTION RATES. OF THE STATE WOULD INSTEAD LEAVE THE RATES -- AS INCREASES THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO OCCUR NOW -- BUT USE THAT -- SORT OF SATISFIED THAT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION. FOR RELIEF DURING THE NEXT DOWNTURN TO THE NEXT RECESSION. AND THAT MIGHT HELP DISTRICTS AVOID THE REALLY TO STRING AN EXTRA NEXT DURING THE NEXT RECESSION WHEN THEY MIGHT BE FACING THE PROSPECT OF FLAT TO MAYBE DECLINING FUNDING AT THE SAME TIME THAT COULD BE PRESSURE FOR THE RATES TO CONTINUE INCREASING. THIS ALTERNATIVE WOULD HELP KIND OF MITIGATE THAT THAT REALLY DIFFICULT COMBINATION. THAT'S A FINALLY TRAINING TO BE A RESERVE JUST FOR POP WENT LIKE PROBABLY NEED RESERVE. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND YOU HAD VARIOUS WAYS YOU COULD STRUCTURE IT YOU COULD JUST PUT IT ASIDE AND JUST A RESERVE. FOR I'M GONNA FUTURE PENSION COSTS THAT WOULD BE KIND OF WITH. IN A SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE OTHER RESERVE SIR YOU CREATED A YOU COULD ALSO EXPLORE -- PERHAPS GIVING. THE MONEY TO CAL STAR IS AND LETTING THEM INVESTED IN SOME WAY BUT DIRECTING THEM NOT TO IMMEDIATELY REDUCED RATES BUT TO REDUCE RATES AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO STRUCTURE AT AND WE CAN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT OPTION WE CAN HELP YOU THINK THROUGH. A THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT. SO TURNING TO THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION -- YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT -- DEBTS AND LIABILITIES AND HEARINGS ALREADY THIS YEAR AND WE'VE WRITTEN A WHOLE REPORT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SO I WON'T BELABOR OUR ASSESSMENT OF IT. BUT JUST IN BRIEF WE THINK THE STATE DOES HAVE A BIGGER IN SUCH A LARGE SURPLUS. AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PAY DOWN LIABILITIES SEEMS PRUDENT TO US. AT FIFTY SAVINGS I SIGNIFICANT WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS THAT YOU MAKE TODAY. UP FOR THE SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION ON BEHALF OF DISTRICTS I THINK YOUR DECISION ABOUT THAT WERE REALLY DEPEND ON KIND OF YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON SOME ADDITIONAL SHARE OF DISTRICT LIABILITIES. WHEN THE STATE CONTINUES TO HAVE SOME OF ITS OWN LARGE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IS? BY THE STATE THAT HAS ALREADY TAKEN ON A PRETTY LARGE SHARE OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND CAL STAR IS -- THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOUR FROM THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD HAVE A TAKE ON A BIT MORE. AND SO THAT'S JUST KIND OF SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF THE OTHER DEBTS AND LIABILITIES THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. AFTER THE STATE -- AND ITS OWN EMPLOYEES. SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THAT ARE YES THE WHAT THE ONE SPECIFIC QUESTION. AND CUT A LONELY UP HERE TODAY SO. MAYES GOING FAST -- YEAH. SO OF COURSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STIRS AND AND PURRS AND SO I ASSUME PER IS ARE THE CLASSIFIED. STAFF AND SOME ADMIN. AND SO WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE WITH THIS IS FOCUSED OF COURSE ON STIRS AND WE DON'T TAKE A LOOK AT THE PERS ISSUES FOR THE DISTRICTS. SURE SO YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE EMPLOYEE'S SO CAL STIRS AS ADMINISTERING BENEFITS FOR OUR TEACHER IS -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY KIND OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A EMPLOYEES RUSTIC CREDENTIALS CALPERS IS ADMINISTERING BENEFITS FOR EVERYONE ELSE. BY THE STATE GONNA FOR HISTORICAL REASONS HAS ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A TATER RELATIONSHIP WITH CHARACTERS. IT'S KIND OF UNIQUE IN ITS THAT I THINK THE ONLY PENSION SYSTEM WE CAN THINK OF WHERE THE STATE IS MAKING A REALLY LARGE CONTRIBUTION. ON BEHALF OF LOCAL EMPLOYEES IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH -- SAY CITIES ARE COUNTY IS OR EVEN -- CALPERS -- SCHOOL PAUL THAT SERVE SCHOOLS AND COMMITTEE CALL A PROPOSAL WE ANALYZED -- AS FAR AS HOW THE STATE MIGHT MAKE IT AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS -- YOU KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED WE COULD. CERTAINLY TAKE THAT BACK AND THINK ABOUT IT BUT NOW AT THIS POINT THERE JUST WASN'T THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON CALPERS I GUESS THE QUESTION WAS SOMEWHAT DIRECTED TO THE ADMINISTRATION -- AS YOU SEE ME IN THE AGENDA. WHAT WAS THAT THOUGHT PROCESS OF NOT DOING THIS? FOR CALPERS RIGHT. I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THE THOUGHT PROCESS THE INTENT BEHIND THE PROPOSAL -- AS I MENTIONED AS THE LA -- POINT OUT REALLY WAS IN THE SHORT TERM WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF SOME IMMEDIATE RATE RELIEF AS UNDER THE COUNTER SPENDING PLAN RATES OF SEE IT JUST LOOKING AT THE AT THE PLAN. COM AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO WRITE SOME SHORT TERM RELIEF WHILE ALSO BEING ABLE TO PRIORITIZE SOME LONG TERM SAVINGS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM BY PARTISAN THAT REMAINING TWO POINT THREE BILLION. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE CAL STAR SIDE IT'S JUST SO MUCH LARGER THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES ON THE CAL STAR SIDE IS ESTIMATED AS OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IF I RECALL CORRECTLY TO BE. A JUST OVER SEVENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS WHILE THE CALPERS SITE IS -- JUST ABOUT TWENTY THREE AND A HALF BILLION SO THERE'S THAT DISPARITY THAT THE CONCERT'S PEACHES MAKES UP SUCH A LARGE SHARE -- AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM CUSTER'S COULD PROBABLY HELP ME OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE WHEN IT COMES TO THE DIFFERENCES ON THE RATES AS WELL THAT SCHOOLS ARE PAYING -- ON CAL STIRS VERSUS CALPERS AND HOW THOSE ARE SET IT CETERA -- AND SO WE JUST FELT WITH ALL OF THAT -- CONTACTS THAT WE COULD KIND OF GET THE BEST RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM MAKING THIS PAYMENT ON THE CAL STAR SIDE WITHIN. THE REVENUES THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] CASTERS. YEAH. YEAH BASICALLY IF THIS FOR THIRTY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SET. UP FIRST MY NAME IS DAVID HAMMER FROM CAL STAR IS A DEPUTY SYSTEM ACT REFERS THAT JUST TO GO BACK ON THE FUNDING PLAN -- JUST WANT TO RESTATE THAT THE NO DEFINING PLAN WAS KEY TO TELL STORIES WITH WAS PASSED IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN INSTEAD OF BEING PROJECTED OF RUN OUT OF RUNNING OUT OF ASSETS BY TWO THOUSAND FORTY SIX ONE NOW PROJECTED TO BE FOR FUNDING. FOR FULLY FUNDED BY TWO THOUSAND AND THIS PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE THE SOME RATE RELIEF TO EMPLOYERS AND TO ALSO -- PAID DOWN A PORTION OF THE EMPLOYER SHARE OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF FINANCE MENTION. THE EMPLOYER SHARE OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT SEVENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR. SAID THE PROPOSED TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR WOULD LOWER IT'S ABOUT SIXTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR. AND OUR ESTIMATES ALSO ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ONES PROVIDED BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE WE ESTIMATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WAS GOING TO SAVE THE EMPLOYERS. CLOSE TO SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BETWEEN NOW AND TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY SIX FOR WE FULLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT WOULD NOT ONLY PROVIDER RATE RELIEF BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT WILL MAKE OUR BENEFIT MORE SECURE. IMPROVE A FUNDING LEVELS AND REDUCE THE SIZE OF OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITY. OKAY THANK YOU. HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM IS FOR THEM. MR OKAY THANK YOU. AGAIN THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM NO ACTION TAKEN TODAY ISSUE NUMBER THREE ACCOUNTABILITY UPDATE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD MORNING SERRA CORTEZ AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATE'S ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM INCLUDING A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ROLES OF THE ACTORS IN THE STATE SYSTEM. I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT'S WAS DISTRIBUTED TO YOU. SO TO START ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT THE CHANGE IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM BEGAN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AS PART OF THE ADOPTION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA LCF BACK. ATTACHED TO THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED LCF WAS A NEW ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK THAT'S BEEN ROLLED OUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AS PART OF THE NEW FRAMEWORK THE STATE ADOPTED EIGHT STATE PRIORITIES. I ALREADY AREAS AND THE STATE PRIORITY AREAS ARE LISTED IN THE FIRST BULLET HERE OF THIS HANDOUT. AND THESE ARE THE STATUTORILY DEFINED AREA THE SPECIFIED THE KEY THINGS THE STATE THINGS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS TO FOCUS ON AND EACH PRIORITY PRIORITY AREA IS A LINK TO A STATUTORILY DEFINED PERFORMANCE MEASURE. THAT DETERMINES HOW WELL SCHOOLS ARE DOING SO PUT IN PLACE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS WERE DISTRICTS DEVELOP A PLAN WITH GOALS AND ACTION ON HOW THEY PLAN TO IMPROVE IN THE EIGHT STATE PRIORITY AREAS. AND DISTRICTS HAVE TO GO AND GET FEEDBACK FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEN THE ULTIMATELY HAVE TO GET THEIR EL CAPS APPROVED BY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. SO NOW PRIORITY AREAS PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND EL CAP THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER -- FOR EXAMPLE FOR A DISTRICT TO DEVELOP AN L. COP THEY HAVE TO HAVE A GOAL THAT FOCUSES ON A PRIORITY AREAS SO LET'S SAY STUDENT ENGAGEMENT. ONE OF THE PERFORMANCE AREAS FOR STUDENT ENGAGEMENT IS GRADUATION RATES. SO DISTRICT WILL HAVE A GOAL THAT DETAILS THE STEPS THEY WILL TAKE ON HOW THEY WANT PROOF THEIR GRADUATION RATES IN THE EL CAP. SO MOVING ON TO PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT WE DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. THE STATE ASSESSES DISTRICT PERFORMANCE THROUGH STATUTORILY DEFINED MEASURES AND THOSE RESULTS ARE DISPLAYED ON THE DASHBOARD A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WEBSITE. USING THE RESULTS OF THE DASHBOARD THE STATE IDENTIFIES DISTRICTS THAT NEED ASSISTANCE. THE STATE LOOKS AT EVERY STUDENT GROUP PERFORMANCE FOR EVERY PRIORITY AREA. AND IF THE DISTRICT HAS THE STUDENTS SUB GROUP IN THE LOWEST PERFORMANCE CATEGORY FOR TWO OR MORE PRIORITY AREAS THERE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING SUPPORT. IN THE FALL THE STATE IDENTIFIED THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE DISTRICTS AND THIRTY ONE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AS NEEDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. 65% OF THE A DEN OF AS THOSE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING SUPPORT WERE BECAUSE OF PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH THEIR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR THAT THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED DISTRICT THAT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. IN THIS FUTURE THE STATE WILL IDENTIFY -- DISTRICTS THAT NEED EVEN MEET AT EVEN GREATER LEVEL SUPPORT BUT THAT BUT THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT IS FORTHCOMING. SO -- ON PAGE THREE I'LL DISCUSS THE ENTITIES INTENDED TO SUPPORT THESE -- DID A SUPPORT DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED. THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT FUNDED ENTITIES -- THAT WOULD HAVE A ROLE IN THE SYSTEM. PLEASE ENTITIES INCLUDE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WHO SUPPORT DISTRICTS DIRECTLY. THE COUNTY OFFICES COULD ALSO HELP THE THE DISTRICTS FIND A TEAM OF EXPERTS TO SUPPORT UP TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. ON THE DISTRICTS COULD ALSO OPT OUT OF THEIR SUPPORT -- BY FINDING THEIR OWN. THERE'S ALSO LEAD AGENCIES THESE ARE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREAS -- CALLED SELFIES -- THAT SUPPORT COUNTY OFFICES DISTRICTS OR SELF IS ALSO SUPPORT OTHER CELL BUT AS I'M YOU MAY HEAR THESE LEADS REFER TO AS GEOGRAPHICALLY THEIR CELL BELIEVES. AND THERE'S OTHER LEADS BUT THESE ARE THE MAIN ONES THAT HAVE READ OF THAT HAVE ONGOING FUNDING -- AND THEN THERE'S THE COOK THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE A STATEWIDE AGENCY THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE C. C. E. HELP COORDINATE SUPPORT AMONG LEADING AGENCIES AND MAY ALSO DIRECTLY SUPPORT DISTRICTS. ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT I'M DESCRIBES THEFUNDING FOR DISTRICTS SUPPORT AND THIS IS THE MAJOR ONGOING FUNDING PROVIDED FOR THESE ENTITIES. SO COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE PROVIDED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET ARE PROVIDED FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION THROUGH THE COUNTY LOOK -- COUNTY OFFICE WELL THE CONTROL FUNDING SUPPORT ALL DISTRICTS NOT JUST THOSE THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. AND THEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO SUPPORT IDENTIFIED DISTRICTS. AND THEN THIS IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF IDENTIFIED DISTRICTS AND THE SIZE OF THOSE DISTRICTS -- THERE WAS A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE OVER THE AN INCREASE FROM THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF IDENTIFIED DISTRICTS HAS INCREASED. LEAD AGENCIES ARE ALSO PROVIDED SOME ONGOING FUNDING THE CELL BELIEVE AGENCIES ARE PROVIDED -- TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THE COUNTY OFFICE REGIONAL THE GEOGRAPHICALLY IT'S ARE PROVIDED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE COLLABORATIVE -- C. C. E. IS PROVIDED UP TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS THE SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO PROVIDING DISTRICT SUPPORT IN YOUR AGENDA YOU'LL ALSO SEE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES. THE STATE TO ALSO IDENTIFY IN SUPPORT SCHOOLS ON THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT SCHOOLS ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE PANEL WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE STATE'S PROGRESS. AND THIS CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. LARA FINANCES NEXT LEVEL THANK YOU. DAN HAD OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE INCREASE WILL ACCOUNTABILITY AND CALIFORNIA EDUCATION. WITH THE BUDGET FLEXIBILITY THAT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES HAVE UNDER THE NOW FULLY IMPLEMENTED LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA -- TO THAT AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE COMPANY INTEREST. TRAILER BILL. CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPOSALS TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE STATE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND HELP IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. THE FIRST IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE ALIGNMENT AND INTEGRATION OF ONLINE PLATFORMS SUPPORTING THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE SYSTEM AND THE SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT CARDS. SOMEONE TO PASS PROPOSALS THIS FUNDING WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. WHO IS THE CONTRACTOR FOR ALL THREE SYSTEMS? INTEGRATING THE SYSTEMS INTO A SINGLE WEB BASED APPLICATION% WILL HELP TO INCREASE ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND ELLIE IS. BY ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO ACCESS A SINGLE PLATFORM FOR THIS INFORMATION STREAMLINING THE SYSTEMS AND ELIMINATING DUPLICATIVE AN OUTDATED INFORMATION. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS NON PRPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO MAKE PERMANENT TO POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THAT WAS SUPPORT THE ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD TO MEET STATE AND FEDERAL ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE. THAT THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION PLAY WITHIN THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO ALIGN WITH THE EXPECTED WORKLOAD OF THE COLLABORATIVE AND FOR THE SUPPORT ITS MISSION OF PROVIDING SUPPORT TO ELEAZAR. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES INCREASING FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE OF EDUCATIONAL. FOR HAVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE BY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND. THIS -- BRINGING ITS TOTAL ON GOING ALLOCATION TO ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TASK IN THE COLLABORATIVE BUT THE ROLE OF FACILITATING THE COORDINATION OF ACTIVITIES. BEING UNDERTAKEN BY VARIOUS ENTITIES THE ONE SYSTEM SUPPORT. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SUPPORT DISTRICTS. FOR ELIGIBLE FOR DIFFERENT AGE ASSISTANCE FOR A TOTAL OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THIS IS AN INCREASE FROM THE SIXTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDE IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING. FOR SCHOOLS IDENTIFIED FOR COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT IMPROVEMENT UNDER THE EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS AMOUNT WILL LIKELY CHANGE DURING THE SPRING PROCESS TO REFLECT UPDATED FEDERAL GRANT INFORMATION. FINALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES SEVERAL TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS AIMED AT PROVIDING MORE PARITY. BETWEEN THE EL CAP DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. SPECIFICALLY THE LANGUAGE SPECIFIES THAT THE CHARTERS THAT CHARTER SCHOOL SHOULD BE ADDRESSING STATE PARTIES TO THEIR AID AND THEY'RE ALL CAPS. ADOPTING THEIR L. CAPS AT A PUBLIC HEARING. PROMINENTLY POSTING THEIR L. CAPS ON THEIR WEBSITES. AND TRANSLATING REPORTS AND NOTICES IF 15% OR MORE OF THEIR STUDENTS -- IN ROAD SPEAK A PRIMARY LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THESE CHANGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH RATHER THE REQUIREMENTS PLACED ON TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND WILL BRING MORE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO CHARGE COOPERATIONS. WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I BELIEVE WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. YES GOOD MORNING I'M SAN BECAUSE HONEST WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THAT DESPERATE REDESIGN. AND THEN GO INTO THE ELIGIBILITY FOR DISTRICTS AND FOR OUR SCHOOLS UNDER OUR STATE AND FEDERAL ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS -- SO I AM HERE REPRESENTING OF COURSE -- OUR NEW SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAS BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE DASHBOARD AND WE DID PASS OUT BUT I WANTED HAND OUT OF WHAT IS NEW ON THE DASHBOARD. AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT THIS BODY APPROVED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WAS ABLE TO WITH ITS CONTRACTORS SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. REDESIGNED CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD THIS PAST FALL FIRM WHO SPECIALIZES IN DATA VISUALIZATION. AND INPUT FROM NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS TO INFORM THE CURRENT DESIGN WHICH IS FRIENDLIER SIMPLER SIMPLER TO USE AND EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. THE DASHBOARD IS NOW FULLY TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH AMERICA'S FOREIGN THE COST OF TO ADD UP TO THREE MORE LANGUAGES IN FUTURE RELEASES. THE DASHBOARD ALSO NOW OFFERS A COMPARISON FEATURE AT THE INDICATOR AND STUDENT GROUP LEVEL. OF HOUSE SCORE DISTRICTS PERFORMANCE IS COMPARED WITH THE STATE LEVEL. IN ADDITION WITH 80% FEWER PAGES WERE ABLE TO KEEP USERS ENGAGED IN THE SITE. THE DASHBOARD PROVIDES PARENTS EDUCATORS OF MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ON SCHOOL DISTRICT PROGRESS SO THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS TO IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING. THE DASHBOARD IS USED TO HELP DISTRICTS IN SCHOOL IDENTIFY STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES AND PINPOINT STUDENT GROUPS MAY BE STRUGGLING. TO DISPLAY SUCH AS THE EQUITY REPORT. ADDITIONALLY WEB TRAFFIC STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE REDESIGNED DASHBOARD IS BEING WIDELY USED AND THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ALONE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY. THOUSAND PAGES WITH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND UNIQUE VISITORS ON THE SITE. TO SUPPORT THE RELEASE THE REDESIGNED DASHBOARD THE CVT ALSO DEVELOPED ADDITIONAL REPORTS THAT ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY EDUCATORS REVIEWING THEIR ALL CAPS WHICH SHOWS STUDENT GROUP RESULTS ON HOW SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS ARE DOING. BASED ON EACH INDICATORS FIVE BY FIVE PLACEMENT OR COLOR GREAT. FROM OCTOBER THROUGH FEBRUARY THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTED NUMEROUS WEBINARS AND IN PERSON PRESENTATIONS WITH OVER SIX THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ON THE NEW DESIGN WE ALSO PARTNER WITH THE CITY FOUNDATION TO PRODUCE NEW VIDEOS TO DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF THE SITE MY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PARENTS TO UNDERSTAND. IN ADDITION A WITH THE COLLABORATION THE CCC WE DID A ONE A ONE ON THE DASHBOARD WHICH WAS ALSO WELL ATTENDED. WITH THAT I WAS GOING TO TURN OVER TO DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENT CHEATED ASSISTANCE. SO BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STATE AND LOCAL MEASURES ON THE DASHBOARD THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN DISTRICTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR SUPPORT TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES BASED ON THE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. THIS INCLUDES ELEVEN DISTRICTS BASED ON LOCAL INDICATORS AND TO BASED ON A COMBINATION OF STATE AND LOCAL INDICATORS. WITH THE ADDITION OF COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ON THE DASH FOR THIS YEAR WE SEE THAT FIFTY TWO OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE AT LEAST ONE DISTRICT IDENTIFIED. AND FINALLY. WITH THREE STUDENT GROUPS THE THREESOME GROUPS IN THE GREATEST NEED OF SUPPORT CONTINUE TO BE LED BY OF COURSE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. HOMELESS AND OUR FOSTER YOU STUDENT GROUPS. AND FINALLY I'LL CONCLUDE WITH SCHOOLS THAT IDENTIFIED UNDER THE EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT. SO UNDER THE EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE SCHOOL ABILITY FOR COMPREHENSIVE ACRONYM IS C. S. I.. BASED ON THE CRITERIA IN CALIFORNIA'S EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT STATE PLAN. SUCH IDENTIFICATION MUST OCCUR AT LEAST ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS AND INCLUDE AT LEAST OF THE LOWEST -- MUST INCLUDE AT LEAST THE LOWEST PERFORMING 5% OF ALL SCHOOLS RECEIVING TITLE ONE FUNDS. IN ADDITION ANY PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL HAS GRADUATION RATE HAS FALLEN BELOW 67% FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE -- SCRIPT SUPPORT AN IMPROVEMENT REGARDLESS OF ITS TITLE ONE STATUS. BASED ON THE DASHBOARD THREE HUNDRED SCHOOLS RIGHT IN A FIGHT BASED ON THE GRADUATION RATE. OF THESE SCHOOLS 82% RESIDE IN ELEAZAR ELIGIBLE UNDER THE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS THERE DISTRICT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED ALREADY FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE BASED ON THE STATE INDICATOR IS OLD AT THE ALL STUDENT LEVEL. OF THE SCHOOLS 77% RESIDE IN ELLIE IS CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR A DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE UNDER THE STATE'S ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. THE EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT ALSO REQUIRES THAT STATES DETERMINE WHICH SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A NEW AD AREA CALLED TARGETED SUPPORT AN IMPROVEMENT. T. S. I.. BASED ON STUDENT PERFORMANCE UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE PLANNED FOR THE EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT SCHOOLS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE FOR THE PREVIOUS -- PART WHICH IS THE COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS NEW. REGARDLESS OF THEIR FRIEND THEIR TITLE ONE FUNNY STATUS IF THEY HAVE ONE OR MORE STUDENT GROUPS THAT FOR TWO COULD TO GO TO OUR MARKETS ACTIVE YEARS MEET THE CRITERIA APPLIED TO IDENTIFY THE LOWEST PERFORMING 5% OF TITLE ONE SCHOOLS. I'D CALIFORNIA HAS USE THE CRITERIA FOR THIS THIS NEW GROUP YES I ENDS AND ADD IN AND THEN THAT AND FOR ADDITIONAL TARGETS SUPPORT. AN IMPROVEMENT EIGHTY SI I IF COMBINED THEM THE THE CRITERIA SINCE THE THE SAME. SO WE ARE -- WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN. SCHOOLS THAT MEET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR THIS THIS NEW -- ATS SIDE OF THESE SCHOOLS AT LEAST AT 8282% RESIDE AND ELEAZAR ELIGIBLE UNDER THE CURRENT -- DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE BONTA FOR THE STATE. THIS DEPARTMENT. IS IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING FUNDING OUT FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT AN IMPROVEMENT -- PART AND STUDENTS BUT SCHOOLS ARE SCHOOLS INVESTORS WILL START RECEIVING THAT MONEY SHORTLY. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM -- MR ARE YOU REALLY DON'T. YES GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS TOM MARMALADE ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE OF THE CCD. WHEN I SPEAK TO FOUR ELEMENTS OF OUR WORK THE FIRST IS IN REGARD TO THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS ON PAGE? FOURTEEN OF YOUR PACKET OF REFERENCES -- A DIAGRAM THAT WE HAVE USED TO KIND OF HELP TO FIND HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND IN PARTICULAR YOU'LL NOTICE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. WORD SPEAKS THE CC IN THE CD AND THEN ALSO WORKING WITH THE STATE BOARD OF ED STAFF. ON MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE BRINGING THESE AGENCIES TOGETHER WE HELPED IDENTIFIED. FOR EXAMPLE THE CRITERIA CHOOSING GEOGRAPHICALLY NEEDS AS WELL AS A CELL BELIEVES WELLS A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. FOLKS TO AND SO OUR ROLE HAS BEEN TO BE ABLE TO BRING THOSE FOLKS TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER SUPPORT. TO OTHER COUNTY OFFICES WITHIN THEIR EDUCATIONAL BOUNDARIES AND AND THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR THEIR GEOGRAPHIC LEAD IN ADDITION TO THE LEAVES THAT YOU SEE ON THE OUTSIDE. THESE ARE OTHER LEADS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE SOME OF OUR NEW THIS YEAR. SOME OF THEM AROUND FOR YEAR. TWO AND AGAIN OUR ROLE IS TO BRING THOSE FOLKS TOGETHER WORKING WITH THE GEOGRAPHICALLY NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE'S A DISTRICT WITHIN THE COUNTY OFFICE BOUNDARIES OF ANYWHERE IN THE STATE THAT HAS A PARTICULAR NEED. AND THAT COUNTY OFFICES IN THE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT THEY COULD REACH OUT TO THE G. O. LEAD. THE COULD ALSO REACH OUT TO THESE OTHER LEADS THEY CAN REACH OUT TO THE COLLABORATIVE AS WELL AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THAT RESOURCE -- SO THAT'S ONE PARTICULAR ROLE IT'S NEW THIS YEAR WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FOLKS IN THAT SYSTEM NOW FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. THE SECOND PIECE OF OUR WORK IS AROUND EIGHTEEN FORTY SO THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN FISCAL DISTRESS IN THE STATE THERE ARE FOUR DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. OF INGLEWOOD -- MAN VALLEJO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SOUTH MONTEREY IN OAKLAND WE'VE DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK THIS YEAR IN PARTICULAR WITH INGLEWOOD AND VALLEJO SCHOOL DISTRICT. WHERE IN INGLEWOOD WE'VE ALREADY BEEN ASSIGNED THERE BY COUNTY OFFICE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP THEM ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE IS THEIR STRUGGLING BOTH PHYSICALLY? AND ACADEMICALLY IN VALLEJO WE HAVE BEEN ASKED BY THE DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY OFFICE TO GO IN AND DO SOME WORK WITH THEM TOO SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WE'VE ACTUALLY SPENT A DAY THERE YESTERDAY. WITH THOSE FOLKS WE'VE GOT SOME INITIAL WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH OAKLAND AND WE'VE BEEN IN SOUTH MONTEREY AND SELF MONTEREY JUST LAST WEEK WE WENT IN AND DID THEIR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. FOR THEM WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE. SO OUR WORKERS BEEN PRETTY HEAVILY FOCUSED ON THAT WORK. IN ADDITION YOU'LL SEE IN THE PACKET IT REFERENCES THE WORK TO BE DONE WITH PROFESSIONAL LEARNING THAT WORKS. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO WHERE WE HAVE FIFTY FOUR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING THAT WORKS ACROSS THE STATE MANY OF THOSE AND THIRTY EIGHT OF THOSE ARE WITH COUNTY OFFICE. AND WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE BRING FOLKS TOGETHER USUALLY IT'S COUNTY OFFICE AND SCHOOL DISTRICT FOLKS WHO COME TOGETHER TO TRY TO TACKLE SPECIFIC PROBLEM AROUND THE ACADEMIC NEEDS OF THE DISTRICT TO THE COUNTY OFFICE. EXAMPLES OF THAT WOULD BE AND AND NAPA COUNTYWHERE WE JUST HAD SOME WORK IN PARTICULARLY THE WORKING WITH THEM FOR TWO YEARS WITH NAPA COUNTY OFFICES WORK WITH THEIR LOCAL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE REALLY SMALL DISTRICTS. AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO SERVE SOME OF THEIR FOSTER YOUTH SO IT'S COME TOGETHER WITH THEM TO TRY TO BRAINSTORM AND BRING RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS -- IN SOUTH MONTEREY WE'VE DONE SOME WORK IN THAT COUNTY WHERE THEY HAVE BROUGHT ALL THE DISTRICTS THEY HAVE ONE LARGER HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MOSTLY DISTRICTS ARE FEEDER DISTRICTS. SO THEY BROUGHT THOSE FOLKS TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY COULD MAKE SURE THAT THE ASSESSMENTS IN THE PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE CASE LEVEL. WOULD BE ABLE TO BE CONSISTENT STATE WHEN STUDENTS WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL THEY WOULD HAVE A THEY BE ABLE TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEN THE LAST THING I'LL SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IS OUR LEVIN PILOT DISTRICTS AND SO WE HAVE -- WE ARE FUNDED FOR YEARS AGO OUR PILOTS PACIFIC FUNDING TO GO IN AND WORK WITH ELEVEN DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- WHO ARE STRUGGLING ACADEMICALLY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THOSE DISTRICTS FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS? IN A PARTICULAR TRYING TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE TO PROVIDE THE PTSA MODEL WHICH IS A PLAN TO STUDY ACT SO BASICALLY. LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR AREA WHERE THEY'RE STRUGGLING HELPING PLAN AROUND SOME RESOURCE PROVIDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT HELP HIM STUDY PARTICULAR WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. ACT ON THAT AND THEN DO THAT UNDER THE SHORT CYCLES THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR SO WILL WE HAVE A FINAL REPORT TO BE COMING OUT NEXT PALMER EXCITED ABOUT SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THERE'S WELL. THANK YOU SURE I'M SET FROM THE STATE BOARD OF IT. GOOD MORNING DAVID TOP OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANNING PROCESS. AND THE AGENDA MATERIALS AS WELL THE ONLY -- GAVE A VERY GOOD OVERVIEW OF WHAT THIS REQUIREMENTS ARE AND HOW THEY HAVE SORT OF INVOLVES AND SELF CFF WAS FIRST ENACTED. SO I WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL THERE BUT REALLY JUST TO NOTE THAT THIS IS WHERE ELEAZAR REQUIRED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. TO LOOK AT THEIR PROGRESS ACROSS THE EIGHT OUT PRIORITY AREAS IDENTIFIED IN STATUTE TRACK ON THE TWENTY ONE STATUTORY METRICS ENGAGE WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDERS AND SORT OF DOCUMENT. IN THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN HOW THE THE ACTIONS THEY'RE TAKING AND THEIR GOALS IN THE EXPENDITURES TO SUPPORT THOSE ACTIONS TO ADVANCE PROGRESS. THE L. THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN TEMPLATE THE STATE BOARD WAS REQUIRED TO A DOCTOR AND IT WAS INITIALLY ADOPTED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH GIVEN THE OTHER PIECES OF THIS ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF LOOK DEVELOPMENT OF THESE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS OCCURRED BEFORE WE HAD THE DASHBOARD IN PLACE. AND OCCURRED BEFORE THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WAYS -- BUILT OUT AND ROBERT. IN ISRAEL WERE DEDICATED. BUT THESE ELEMENTS THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN THE DASHBOARD IN THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WERE ALWAYS INTENDED TO WORK TOGETHER AS A SINGLE SYSTEM. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN IS THAT THERE'S BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO GO BACK AND UPDATE IT TO REFLECT THE ADDITIONAL ACTIONS TAKEN. AS WE PROGRESS WITH IMPLEMENTATION. IN FACT THE STATE BOARD IS UPDATED THEIR LOCAL COMPANY PLAN TEMPLATE TWICE SINCE TWENTY FOUR SINCE JANUARY OF TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT THE MOST RECENT CHANGE HAD TO REALLY IMPORTANT CHANGES FOCUSED ON TRANSPARENCY IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE INFORMATION IN THE EL CAP IN THE EXPENDITURES REFLECTED THEIR THE FIRST IT. WAS A BUDGET SUMMARY THAT REALLY JUST A HIGH LEVEL OR SORRY A PLAN SUMMARY THAT WAS A HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF SIR WHAT'S THE KEY TAKE AWAYS. OF THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANNED THAT THE DISTRICT HAS ADOPTED IN ALSO CLARIFYING THAT THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL ACTUALLY HAS TO IDENTIFY EACH ACTION IN THE EL CAP THATIS CONTRIBUTING TO ITS OBLIGATIONTO INCREASE IMPROVE SERVICES. FOR THE THREE HIGH NEED STUDENT GROUPS THAT RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS UNDER L. CFF. AS THE AGENDA MATERIALS NOTED LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT INCLUDED TWO KEY CHANGES ONE IS A NEW DOCUMENT THAT'S REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY COULD PLAN. THAT IS A BUDGET SUMMARY FOR PARENTS AND AGAIN THE GOAL OF THAT DOCUMENT SPREAD GREATER TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE DISTRICTS OVERALL REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES. AS WELL AS HOW THOSE RELATE TO WHAT WE SEE AND LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN THAT IT'S ADOPTED. AND ITS REQUIREMENT TO INCREASE IMPROVE SERVICES HOW THE EXPENDITURES IN THE EL CAP REALLY MEET THAT OBLIGATION. AND THE SECOND PIECE WHICH THE BOARD WILL BE WORKING ON THIS YEAR IS A REQUIREMENT TO UPDATE THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. TEMPLATE TO INCLUDE SUMMARY TABLES THE ENTIRE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN ALL THE EXPENDITURES INCLUDED AND ALSO FOR THOSE ACTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR APARTMENT TO INCREASE IMPROVE SERVICES FOR HIGH NEED STUDENTS. SO THE GOAL THERE IS TO JUST MAKE IT IS AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR PARENTS IN THE COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE DISTRICT IS PRIORITIZING ITS RESOURCES. THAT THEY CAN ENGAGE AND THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS. SO THAT ADDITIONAL CHANGE AT THE BOARD MEETING THEM IN THE CURRENT TEMP -- EL CAP TEMPLATE IS TO ADD PROBLEMS IN THE SUMMARY OF THE EL CAP THAT REQUIRED THE ALLEY A TO ADDRESS ANY AREAS ON THE DASHBOARD WHERE THERE'S LOW PERFORMANCE OR WHERE THERE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN PERFORMANCE AMONG STUDENT GROUPS. SECOND OF ALL THERE WAS TO BUILD OUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DASHBOARD INDIA AND THAT LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN SET THE STATE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE STANDARDS. IS A KEY ASPECT OF THE CONVERSATION LOCALLY ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE AND FOCUS WITHIN THEIR LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS. AND SIGNIFICANTLY REALLY ENSURING THAT IF THERE ARE DISPARITIES IN PERFORMANCE AMONG STUDENT GROUPS THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL UNITS WE MUST ADDRESS THAT WITHIN LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS AND ENGAGE WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THAT CONVERSATION. SO I THINK TO CONCLUDE WHAT I WOULD NOTE IS THAT WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH THE EXISTENCE OF THE DASHBOARD THE UPDATED LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN TEMPLATE. IS SORT OF WHERE THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS IS ABLE TO WORK AS IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED WHERE WE HAVE LOCALLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION BUT ALSO THOSE STATE MEASURES. THAT ARE REPORTED AGAINST CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS STATEWIDE AND REALLY HELP FOCUSING GUIDE LOCAL CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WHAT THE DISTRICT IS PROPOSING TO DO AND HOW TO USING ITS FUNDS IT'S FUNDS IS REALLY WORKING. FOR STUDENTS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR THE HIGH NEED STUDENT GROUPS THAT THEY SERVE. I THINK THAT THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO TRANSPARENCY THAT THE NEXT LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN TEMPLATE WILL INCLUDE AROUND THERE'S EXPENDITURES WILL JUST FURTHER THAT GOAL OF ENSURING ROBUST CONVERSATION THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ENGAGE IN THE KIND IT JUST OF WHAT IS THE DISTRICT PROPOSING TO DO BUT HOW IS IT PRIORITIZING ITS RESOURCES -- TO TO ACHIEVE THOSE ACTIONS AND SERVICES SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE CAMPUS SECURITY THEY HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL I THE I THINK THIS HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION CALIFORNIA'S PRETTY CONFUSING -- I DON'T PUT THAT ON YOU UNDERSTOOD IT IS. THE SPIRIT HOW ABOUT THE ABOUT MIKE MY QUESTIONS MA'AM ARE MOSTLY FOR MISTER MOLINO -- ABOUT THE CAM THE CALIFORNIA CLAMOR FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE -- IN JUST ALL DAHLE SURE ONE WHO SAW A SCHOOL DISTRICT CALLS YOU IN THEY MIGHT CALL YOU IN FOR THE DISTRICT THE SCHOOL SITE. WALK ME THROUGH HELP WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE THE AND IF IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE WE WE GET CONTACTED AROUND DIFFERENCE ASSISTANCE IT'S USUALLY THE DISTRICT. RIGHT SO THAT WORK IS FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON THE DISTRICT LEVEL IN THE DISTRICTS A THE RESULTS BASED ON THE DASHBOARD DATA OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE OF SEND. THE SYSTEM THAT WE GENERALLY DO WE REACH OUT TO THE COUNTY OFFICE FIRST. TO SEE THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE AS A RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM. COUNTY OFFICE OFTEN WILL BE ABLE TO SAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SPORTS IN THE RESOURCE TO HELP WHETHER SAY LET'S GO AND LOOK INTO THAT TOGETHER. IN THE NEW SYSTEM YOU CAN ALSO REACH OUT TO GEOGRAPHICALLY ITSELF IT'S TRYING TO CREATE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF SUPPORT -- BUT AGAIN ALL WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TOGETHER SO RECENTLY THERE WAS -- THERE WAS A LET'S PUT ON A BELIEVE A LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS RIGHT THERE WAS LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED SCHOOLS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON THE LIST. CERTAINLY A VERY HIGH NUMBER SO DO WE KNOW THAT DID DID EACH DISTRICT REACH OUT TO AT A AT A MINIMUM THERE COUNTY FOR HELP. ARE THEY YOU'RE SPEAKING TO US SO YES I CAN THE YOUR SPEAK AND ACCESS TO THE SCHOOL'S EVER IDENTIFIED. SO IN THIS ASSEMBLY. LOW BACK UP WHAT METRIC IS THERE IS THERE IS THERE ARE METRIC THAT MAKES YOU AVAILABLE TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR IS IS THERE ARE METRIC. THAT MAKES IT MANDATED THAT YOU HELP ON A SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THERE IS A MANDATE AND THAT THE MANDATE IS AROUND EIGHTEEN FORTY DISTRICTS LOGISTICS CENTER IN FISCAL DISTRESS SO THERE'S A MANDATE AROUND US WORKING WILL AUTOMATICALLY BEING ASSIGNED TO THOSE DISTRICTS SO DISTRICTS LIKE INGLEWOOD THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEM DOES HAVE A STATE LOAN. SO FOR THOSE DISTRICTS IN PARTICULAR. THERE'S A MANDATE THAT WE WOULD GO IN AND WORK WITH THOSE DISTRICTS IN PARTICULAR THE OTHER ONES ARE THERE'S ALSO MANDATES AROUND -- CHARTER SCHOOLS WHEN CHARTER SCHOOLS WILL QUALIFY -- DID THE REST OF IT IS REALLY DEPENDENT UPON WHAT THE COUNTY OFFICE HAS TO OFFER AND WHAT THEY CAN OR CANNOT OFFER ME ARTS BE ABLE TO HELP THE DISTRICT. YOU WERE REFERENCING SCHOOLS SCHOOLS ARE UNDER THE S. A PLAN. SO SCHOOLS HAVE A DARN GOOD FOR WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC TIED TO THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED UNDER SO. ALTHOUGH WE COULD WORK WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE ON SUPPORT THAT THEY CAN OFFERS WELL LOCALLY. SO THE FIRST THE FIRST UP FOR DISTRICT IS THE COUNTY. CORRECT CORRECT DO WE HAVE ANY DATA RELATIVE TO TO HOW THIS IS WORKING FOR FOR IF A DISTRICT HAS GONE TO THE COUNTY OR EVEN IF DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO THE COUNTY DO WE KNOW THAT. YES THEY ARE GOING TO THE COUNTY THE MAJORITY OF COUNTY OFFICES IN THE STATE. ARE PROVIDING THAT FIRST LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE WE HAVE ONLY WORKED WITH A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS. WHO HAVE -- ACTUALLY LESS THAN TEN DISTRICTS TO WHERE THE COUNTY IS NOT WORKING WITH THEM. AND AGAIN THIS IS THEIR SECOND YEAR THE GENERAL -- SENSE OF DISTRICTS AS THAT'S WORKING PRETTY WELL. SO YOUR MAJOR INTERACTION IS WITH. A COUNTY TYPICALLY THAT'S USE USES THE COUNTY OFFICES TO BUILD THE CAPACITY TO HELP. THE DISTRICT LEVEL THAT'S RIGHT. SO THAT'S IN IN ONE ELEMENT OF OUR WORK THAT'S AROUND THE DIFFERENCES SYSTEMS PIECE IN BACK TO YOU SPOKE TO A WHEN IS SCHOOL THIS UNIT IS IN FISCAL DISTRESS HOW DOES YOUR OLD OF HER THAN FACT MATT -- WHAT WOULD LOOK AT THE ACADEMIC PIECE OF THICK MATS ROLE AS THEY GO IN AND THEY? THEY IN PARTICULAR LOOK AT DOING A STUDY WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING PART OF THAT WITHIN THE FIXED MARRIAGE RECORD TO THE LAND LOOK UNDER THESE THE SPECIFIC FIVE ELEMENTS ONE OF THOSE IS ACADEMIC. AND SO THEY DO A REVIEW OF THE DISTRICT AND THEY IDENTIFY WHERE THEY'RE DOING WELL WHERE THEY'RE NOT DOING WELL -- AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEIR ROLE IS WHAT OUR ROLE NOW WITH EIGHTEEN FORTY YEARS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY WILL GO INTO AN ACADEMIC REVIEW SO IT'S ALL GOING TO REVIEW THE DISTRICT ACADEMICALLY LOOKED COUNTY OFFICE AND TO HELP THE DISTRICT IDENTIFY PLANNED. BETTER IN THAT WE ALSO ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME OF US FINANCIAL RESOURCES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IN OTHER AREAS IT'S ACTUALLY SUPPORT HELPING THEM GET BETTER. AND THEN WHO DO YOU REPORT TO A BOARD YES YOU HAVE A BOARD. OKAY AND DO YOU HAVE ANY -- NUMBERS DATA RELATIVE TO WHAT YOU DO EVERY YEAR. HOW MANY INTERACTIONS YOU HAVE OR YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING AROUND THE STATE YEAH WE DO ACTUALLY IF THERE'S A? SIDE AND BRING IT WITH ME BUT WE HAVE ALSO HAVE WE HAVE A MAP ON OUR WEBSITE THAT SHOWS THAT WE'RE WE ARE AT LAST YEAR. LAST YEAR WE OVER ITS DO WE DON'T WE TOUCHED OVER SIX HUNDRED DISTRICTS. AND WORKED WITH ALMOST EVERY COUNTY OFFICE IN THE STATE. AND WHEN YOU GO INTO A DISTRICT WHEN YOU ARE CALLED INTO A DISTRICT. DO YOU GET TO THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL. AND TWO PENS AND AGAIN WE'RE WORD NOT NESTLE CALLED INTO A DISTRICT WERE CALLED IN DISTRICT THAT'S IT SPECIFIC AROUND DIFFERENCES ASSISTANCE OR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WE ALSO DO PROFESSIONAL LEARNING RIGHT SO -- FEEL CITY ADVENTURE WE'VE DONE SOME WORK COMPETE OUNTY OFFICES AROUND THE EL CAP WE DO TRAININGS WOULD -- DIFFERENT COUNTY OFFICES AROUND A PARTICULAR ISSUE LIKE ABSENTEEISM TRUE IS THAT -- TRUANCY THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT WE HAVE OUR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING THAT WORKS WHICH WE HAVE FIFTY FOUR WHICH IS WHERE WE TOUCH MOST DISTRICTS. SO THAT'S WORKING WITH COUNTY OFFICES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHIN THEIR COUNTY AROUND IDENTIFYING A SPECIFIC ACADEMIC AREA THAT THEY MAY BE STRUGGLING WITH WE FACILITATE THAT. PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORK WE PROVIDE THEM A COACH AND THEN HELP THEM OVER A PERIOD OF TIME TO GET BETTER. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS -- TOGETHER WITH JUST THE ON THE WAS A THREE IN SEVENTY FOUR I BELIEVE. ELEAZAR THAT WERE -- FOR THIS YEAR THAT HAD THE THE QUALIFIED FOR THE WHAT DO YOU CALL IT IS OUR EXCHANGE ASSISTANCE. YES RIGHT -- AND AND THEN AS I UNDERSTOOD THERE'S TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE NEW ELEAZAR ON THAT LIST THIS YEAR -- NOT NEW. SO THE I THINK THAT THAT THAT WAS COVERED IN LA A REMARKS ACTUALLY. AND IF YOU WANT TO CLARIFY. THAT P. SIR -- SO I I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT SO THIS YEAR THERE WAS US THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE DISTRICTS IN THAT INCLUDES THIRTY ONE COUNTY OFFICES BUT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION LAST YEAR THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT DISTRICTS SO THERE'S AN INCREASE. FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AN IMPORTANT ANOTHER NINETY THREE OF THE CITRIX MASTER DID EXIT THE PROGRAM RIGHT AND I SO I GOT THAT BUT THEN THAT THIS YEAR THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE NEW ELLIE ETS. AS PART OF THAT OVERALL. THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR NUMBER AND MY QUESTION REALLY IS I I NOTE THAT. IT TALKS ABOUT -- THAT SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THAT WERE -- IT DIDN'T KNOW WHERE. WHERE THEY AND -- FALLING INTO THIS NEED WHAT WHICH WHICH STATE PRIORITY AREAS ARE THEY LACKING IN THAT ARE CAUSING THEM TO GET ON THE LIST IS IS KIND OF MY QUESTION WE CAN DEFINITELY PROVIDE YOU THAT INFORMATION I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO KNOW THAT LAST YEAR'S MEASURES. HAVE GREATLY DIFFERED FROM THIS YEAR'S MEASURES BECAUSE OF ADDITIONAL DATA AS WE WERE AB ABLE TO ADD FOR THE FIRST TIME CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. THEY'RE ABLE TO ADD A COLLEGE CAREER INDICATES DUE TO OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF OUR INTER EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT AND SO. A GRADE ELEVEN NOW PLAYS INTO TO TRADITIONAL INDICATOR SO SO REALLY THE METRICS THAT WERE USING FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN THOSE ADDITIONAL TWO AND FORTY THREE ARE ARE GREATLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUT I CAN DEFINITELY PROVIDE YOU THAT THAT DATA -- IT IN A COMPREHENSIVE FORMAT -- ELECTRONICALLY YOU HAVE WE GET THEN I NOTICED THAT YOU KNOW SO IT WAS DEALING WITH HOMELESS -- SHERIDAN SOME WAS DEALING WITH -- I THINK FOSTER YOUTH -- AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO TRY AND GET A A WHAT IS IT THAT WERE MISSING WITH REGARD TO THESE POPULATIONS. RIGHT -- BECAUSE AT I MEAN I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO KNOW POLICY WAS IS. IS NO WHERE THOSE THINGS BE MISSED AT THAT LEVEL -- CERTAINLY IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT DOES THOSE GROUPS THAT ARE AFFECTED BUT WHAT IS IT THAT'S NOT BEING DONE. AND SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT INFORMATION BACK TO US I MEAN COULD YOU DO THAT IN A WRITTEN FORM BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HERE. I THINK THEY WERE GONNA BE SPENDING THAT THAT THE NEXT YEAR COVERING THAT BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE TO YEARS OF METRICS COME TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WITH WITH THE COUNTY IS BEING INVOLVED IN THAT SYSTEM OF SUPPORT AT YOU KNOW. SIR THAT FIRST GROUND LEVEL THAT STATE -- MISTER MOLINA SPOKE ABOUT -- THEY'LL BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE ROOT CAUSES WE SIMPLY WITH THE DASHBOARD TELL THEM YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WE DON'T AREN'T ABLE TO SAY. WHAT IS CAUSING THAT PROBLEM I THINK THE OTHER THAT'S A IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A LEGISLATION THAT TOLD US THAT WE HAVE TO USE IT? A SMALLER NUMBER -- WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT STUDENT POPULATION SO FAR OUR OTHER STUDENT GROUPS IT'S IT'S AN AND SIZE OF THIRTY FOR FOSTER IN FOR HOMELESS IT'S GOES DOWN? TO FIFTEEN SO WE ARE -- CAPTURING -- YOU KNOW. PROBABLY A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF FOSTER AND AND HOMELESS -- DUE TO THAT SMALLER -- SUBGROUP BUT BUT IT IS THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED FOCUS ON MAKES I'M OF COURSE ARE MOST NEED YOUR STUDENTS. IF. IF YEAH IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT A LITTLE BIT AYE I THINK -- THE THE QUESTION OUT THAT ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE NUMBERS I I THINK WHAT WE HAVE IT WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO DO THAT AND AND WE CERTAINLY CAN. S. FOLLOWING UP ON THIS HEARING SHARE WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE THAT THE CHALLENGES IT'S VERY HARD TO YOU BECAUSE OF THAT THAT CHANGE IN THE INDICATORS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE DASHBOARD. AND IN PARTICULAR YOU KNOW CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. THEY WERE VERY LIMITED INDICATORS THAT APPLIED AT THE K. EIGHT LEVEL. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT REALLY ONLY HAD. EFFECTIVELY THREE COLORS ON THE DASHBOARD AND SO WHEN YOU ADD IN THOSE ADDITIONAL INDICATORS THAT THE NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS THAT CAN LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION INCREASED. SO AS FAR AS REALLY GETTING TO THAT QUESTION OF WHAT ANY RELIABLE CONCLUSIONS JUST WITH THAT SORT OF ONE YEAR OF DATA IS GIVEN THE CHANGE BUT WE CAN SHARE WHAT WE FOUND. BUT I THINK IT'S MISS BECAUSE ON A SAID AS WE LOOK TO NEXT YEAR'S DASH FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN DASH BOARD WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE GREATER LEVELS HEARD. UNDERSTANDING FROM YEAR TO YEAR THAT IT'S COMPATIBLE THERE WILL BE SOME DIFFERENCES BUT THEY WILL BE MUCH. MUCH SMALLER IN TERMS OF THEIR OVERALL IMPACT SO I THINK WE WEHOPE WE WILL BE ABLE DROPPED BETTER CONCLUSIONS THAT CAN INFORM SOME OF THE STATE LEVEL POLICY CONVERSATIONS -- IN A WAY THAT THAT'S MORE RELIABLE IN TERMS OF THE CONCLUSIONS. BUT I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING BILL AND I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT QUESTION IS SO. I'LL USE SPECIAL ED FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR THAT'S THE LARGEST SUBGROUP THAT CONTINUES TO QUALIFY. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID LAST YEAR'S WE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN PARTICULAR TO GO FURTHER INTO THE DATA. IS THE DATA WILL TELL YOU. THAT THE OF SPECIAL ED STUDENTS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS RIGHT BUT SO WHAT THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU IS WHY. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIAL ED FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE MAY SPECULATE AND SAY WELL IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY TEND -- TO CLASS BY A LOT OF HIS SPECIAL THAT WE FOR A LOT OF STUDENTS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION ANOTHER PIECE THAT YOU CAN LOOKAT IN PARTICULAR IS HOW OFTEN ARE STUDENTS ACTUALLY SPENDING TIME IN THE REGULAR CLASSROOM. LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN YOU GO IN AND DO THE DIFFERENCES SYSTEMS YOU'RE ABLE TO UNPACK THAT DATA LOCALLY? SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THINGS WE FOUND LAST YEAR IS IS WHERE. DISTRICTS THAT HAD WE'RE WE'RE READ RIGHT THEY DIDN'T MEET THE CRITERIA MORE THAN ONE AREA. THE THE MORE IS THAT THEY DIDN'T NEED IT WILL BE FOUND TO STUDENTS WERE ACTUALLY IN THE CLASSROOM LAST TIME. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE WE CAN NEED WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT DAY BECAUSE NOW YOU CAN START HAVING SOME CONVERSATIONS AROUND WHY WHY THE STUDENTS NINE CLASSROOMS. RIGHT WHAT WHERE ARE THEY RIGHT AND WHAT WE FOUND ALSO IS THAT STUDENTS ARE IN CLASSROOMS GET SUSPENDED MORE. PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY'RE STRANGERS OFTEN RIGHT IN SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THAT COULD BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT THAT DIFFERENCES SYSTEMS PROCESS ALLOWS YOU TO REALLY GET OUT THAT. DAY JENNIFER I WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS DISTRICT BASED BASED ON THEIR DATA SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO IN AND START TO DO SOME PROBLEM SOLVING. THANK YOU SURE. THANKS JUST HAD A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS -- FOR MISTER NOW -- YOU'D MENTIONED SORT OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN INGLEWOOD AND COUPLE OTHER DISTRICTS. DO YOU ALSO TRACK DISTRICTS THAT ARE SORT OF ON THE CUSP AND DO ASSISTANCE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THEM. WELL HAS HARD TO TRACK HIM BECAUSE WORD WERE JUST IN OUR FIRST COUPLE YEARS WITH THE DATA RIGHT SO THERE ARE THE THE A WE HAVE OUR THIS OUR SECOND YEAR OF ACTUALLY HAVING DATA THAT'S IDENTIFIED BASED ON YOUR DIFFERENCES ASSISTANCE -- SO NO ANSWERS WE DON'T TRACK THEM AT THIS POINT TWO WE ARE. FOCUSED ON THOSE WHO ACTUALLY QUALIFY HARD TO KNOW WHO WOULD QUALIFY NEXT YEAR -- WHAT I CAN TELL YOU THOUGH IS THAT WERE ROUND THOSE DISTRICTS ARE IN FISCAL DISTRESS AROUND THIS I MENTION THAT WE'RE DOING THESE ACADEMIC REVIEWS? AND WE'RE FINDING IS IS WHEN YOU GO AND WEEKS THOSE ACADEMIC REVIEWS WE BELIEVE COULD BE A TOOL THAT WE COULD USE FOR ANY DISTRICT. RIGHT AND SO THAT WE INSTEAD OF JUST THOSE DISTRICTS THAT ARE ARE QUALIFYING ANDRIY EIGHTEEN FORTY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO IDENTIFY THESE TOOLS AND HAVE SOME IDEAS TO WORK WITH COUNTY OFFICES TO TRAIN ON THE USE OF THOSE TOOLS. SO THEY COULD THEY KNOW WHO THOSE LOCAL DISTRICTS ARE AND BE ABLE TO USE THAT TOOL TO BE ABLE TO HELP FOLKS SO THAT VIEWERS WERE ABLE TO APPROACH HIM BEFORE THEY GO INTO DIFFERENCES SYSTEMS. AND AND WITH WHAT YOU SEEN FROM THE DISTRICTS THAT YOU ARE ASSISTING TO SEE ANY COMMON THREADS THAT ARE. SORT OF DRIVING THEM TO DISTRESS YEAH WE DO WHAT WHAT WE FIND IN THERE IS A COUPLE THINGS IT WON'T SURPRISE YOU ONE IS IS THAT YOU KNOW WE USE THE WORD COHERENCE OFTEN THEY HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN PLACE THINGS IN PLACE LIKE. THEY MAY HAVE A CURRICULUM IN PLACE RIGHT BUT HOW IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED IS DIFFERENT. ON AND EVERY SCHOOL SITE THEY MAY HAVE -- TIME FOR TEACHERS TO BE IN PROFESSIONAL LEARNING GROUPS RIGHT WITH A MINIMUM DAY TEACHERS COME TOGETHER. HOW THEY MANAGE THAT TIME TOGETHER IS DIFFERENT IN EVERY SCHOOL -- DAYS SOME HAVE MORE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND OTHERS USE OF DATA IS AN ISSUE WE ALSO HAVE A HUGE TURNOVER IN THOSE DISTRICTS THEIR LEADERSHIP TEAMS IN PARTICULAR. INGLEWOOD FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT THEY'VE HAD THE SAME CABINET LEVEL TEAM. THAT THEY'VE HAD SEVEN YEARS SO PEOPLE COMING AND GOING ALL THE TIME TO CIVILIAN PEACE OR NOTICING TO IS THERE IS A THEIR ABILITY THEIR CAPACITY. TO ACTUALLY DO THINGS TO ACTUALLY MAKE IMPROVEMENTS THIS IS A STRUGGLE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY FOCUSED ON TRYING. TO FIGURE OUT HOW FISCALLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET FISCAL DISTRESS AND SO OFTEN ACADEMICS ARE LEFT BEHIND. WHAT WERE THESE TWO ISSUES I IMAGINE THEY OUGHT TO DO WITH ARE DECLINING ENROLLMENT? YES AND HOW ARE THEY GRAPPLING WITH THAT THERE'S A GROWING WITH THAT AND I GUESS YOU SENT YOU OVERSEE OAKLAND IN OAKLAND JUST GOT THROUGH A TEACHERS STRIKE. WHAT WHAT WHAT DID YOU WHAT DID YOU THINK HOW DID YOU THINK THAT? RESOLUTION -- YOU KNOW WAS. WAS RESOLVED TO DEFY HERE WAS A GOOD RESOLUTION CONCERNING -- I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE AN OPINION ON ON THEIR THEIR RESOLUTION IN REGARDS TO THEIR CONTRACT THE THING I CAN TELL YOU IS THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO CUT MORE PROGRAMS. RIGHT AND SO -- SOME OF OUR WORK AROUND OAKLAND IS SEVEN SUMMER HAVE INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP THEM DETERMINE WHAT TO CUT. CONSTRUCTION WE CYLINDER EL CAP THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THINGS THEY WANT TO DO TO HELP KIDS AND STRUCTURALLY. SO THEY'VE ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE RAIL KAPANEN HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND SAY THEY HAVE THEIR LIST OF CUTS. IN TO SAY IF THEY CUT THIS HOW WOULD THAT'D BE ABLE POWER THAT AFFECT THEM ACADEMICALLY AND SUCH I TO HELP WOMEN UP TO CLICK AND ARE YOU ARE YOU SAYING THAT WITH THE OTHER -- DISTRICTS AS WELL YES ABSOLUTELY AND ARE THEY ARE THEY MAKING THOSE. VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES I MEAN WE DON'T WE DON'T LIKE MAKING CUTS I'M SURE THEY DON'T LIKE MAKING CUTS THOSE ARE NOT FUN. FUN THINGS TO BE DOING YEAH THEY ARE YESTERDAY FOR EXAMPLE WE SPENT THE MORNING WITH VALLEJO IN VALLEJO WAS CUT AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THEIR BUDGET. AND SO PART OF OUR CONVERSATIONS YESTERDAY WAS THE THE REDUCING A COUPLE SCHOOLS ARE TRYING TO HELP THEM DETERMINE HOW WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP THEM IN THAT AREAS ARE DOING THAT -- THEY ARE LOSING PRINCIPLES AND SO HAVE NUMBER DEVELOPING A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THEM. IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP THEM HOW THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO FUND THAT RIGHT IN LOOKING AT THOSE PIECES. AND HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU FOCUS ON YOUR SOURCE I CANNOT BE LIKE THE EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO SOME TRIAGE HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU CREATE STABILITY BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE HARDEST? THE HARDEST THING TO DO BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T. QUEST ABILITY YOU DON'T MAINTAIN ENROLLMENT IF YOU DON'T MAINTAIN AROMA YOU TO MAINTAIN FUNDING SO HOW DO YOU. HOW TO CREATE THAT STABILITY YEAH I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE IS PROBABLY IN THE WOODS SO INGLEWOOD UNDER THE DIRECTION TO COUNTY OFFICE SO THE COUNTY OFFICE IN PARTICULAR WE WENT IN TOGETHER IN THE COUNTY OFFICE WE SPENT? IN SEPTEMBER THAT WHOLE FIRST MONTH WITH A GROUP OF FOLKS WHO WENT IN JUST ANALYZE WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY LOOK THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE FISCAL SIDE ELECTED FACILITIES. WE LOOKED AT SPECIAL ED THAT'S A DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR THAT HAS A LOT OF SPECIAL ED CONCERNS AND WE LOOKED AT THE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS SO WE SPENT TIMES ACTUALLY TRYING TO ANALYZE WHAT EXIST WHAT IS. WHAT'S GOING ON WHERE ARE THE PROBLEMS AND WE DEVELOPED OF WITH THE WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE FIVE STEP PLAN IN EACH OF THOSE AREAS THEY'RE IDENTIFIED STRATEGIES. RESOURCES IN PARTICULAR HOW WE'RE GOING TO ATTACK EACH OF THOSE AREAS WERE MEASURING WE DEVELOP MEASUREMENTS AND WE WILL BE BASHING THOSE QUARTERLY. SO WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SO WE CAN HELP -- NOT JUST WITH STAFF WILL AS WELL AS MAYBE SOME PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER AREAS WITHIN A HAVE A WHOLE I'M SO SUGGESTED YOU GET INVOLVED IN THE FISCAL SIDE SIDE AT ALL OR TO KIND OF PICK IT BACK UP MR O'DONNELL'S QUESTION. OR IS THAT IS THAT STRICTLY WHAT FIFTH MAN DOES. IT IT'S REALLY THICK MATS ROLE IN THE COUNTY OFFICES ROLE BUT YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. AND THAT'S WHAT'S I THINK UNIQUE ABOUT EIGHTEEN FORTY IS A PUTS US BOTH AT THE TABLE SO WE MEET WITH THE MONTHLY. FIXED BATS AT THE TABLE THE COUNTY OFFICES AT THE TABLE CITIES AT THE TABLE AND WERE AT THE TABLE AND WE'RE ALL HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND UPDATING AND EACH OTHER ON WHERE WE'RE AT IN REGARDS. TO WHAT'S HAPPENING BOTH PHYSICALLY AND ACADEMICALLY. BECAUSE ONE OF MY MORE MORE GLOBAL CONCERNS JUST WATCHING ON SOME OF THE STRIKES PLAY OUT IS. HOW? ON MANY DISTRICTS ARE SORT OF ON THE EDGE IT IS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT. SOLUTION TO CREATE THAT STABILITY FOR THEM IS -- BECAUSE IT SEEMS -- RATHER THAN. THE RATHER THAN THE BAR'S ANY FOR THIS TO PRETEND IT SORT OF MAKING THESE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS THEY SEEM TO BE. YOU KNOW LOOKING TOWARDS US FOR MORE MONEY -- WHICH AGAIN AS I THINK IT'S KIND OF A POLITICAL PLOY GOOD POLITICAL POINT BUT NOT REALLY -- SOMETHING THAT'S GROUNDED IN REALITY. SO WHICH I GUESS IS ESPECIALLY FOR THE DISTRICT FOR YOUR I MEAN IN THAT OAKLAND'S. OPEN SIX APPLE ONE OF THEM RIGHT YOUR THAT YOUR WORK WAS HOW DOES HOW DO YOU -- HOW DO YOU PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY? FOR FOR FOLKS TO SORT OF WHAT LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR FOLKS TO MAKE THOSE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. HELLO WANTED THINGS I THINK BULLARD. AGAIN MY WORKERS ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE SO I COULD SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY TO THAT I WAS A COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT RIGHT AND SO IS A COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT FOR MANY YEARS I CAN TELL YOU. WHEN WE HAD DISTRICTS THAT REALLY STRUGGLED? THERE WERE DECISIONS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE SOONER. RIGHT AND SO IN PARTICULAR WE WOULD WE WOULD FIND DISTRICTS WHO WERE DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND MAYBE WE'RE NOT REACTING QUICK ENOUGH SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU'LL SEE SCHOOL CLOSURES WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT. TO BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCHOOL COOL YOU LOOK AT HOW MANY EXISTENCE SOME OF THOSE DISTRICTS LIKE. OAKLAND IN LIKE IN THE LATE HOLE MOST OF THE SAME SCHOOLS ARE STILL OPEN. RIGHT WOULD SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS. IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO COMMUNITY DOESN'T LIKE IT FOR ITS I'VE DONE IT MYSELF -- BUT THAT'S AN EXAMPLE TO WEAR THE SOONER YOU CAN REACT TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS IT HELPS GOING DOWN. DOWN THE ROAD THE THING I CAN TELL YOU ON THE ACADEMIC PIECES IS THAT. I THINK I MENTIONED TO THERE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES EVEN IN THE SCHOOLS BUT THERE'S NO COHERENCE TO IT. AND SO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS WITH THE RESOURCES THAT YOU DO HAVE. MANY OF MY HAVE INSTRUCTIONAL COACHES FOR EXAMPLE HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THE INSTRUCTIONAL COULDN'T WE'RE GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THOSE INSTRUCTIONAL COACHES. HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT TRYING TO BE MORE SYSTEMIC ACROSS THE DISTRICT AND OW WE'RE DOING THAT WORKS AT LEAST WE GET THE BEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK WITH THE MONEY SAID? THAT CONTINUE TO EXIST. THIS SERVICE IS NOT A SINGLE OAKLAND OPERATE SORT OF TOP OF MIND SINCE IT'S BEEN THERE IN THE PRESS MOST OF OUR FLIGHT -- YOU'D MENTIONED THAT THE THE SCHOOL CLOSURE SHOW AND I FORGOT THIRD THE RESOLUTION TO DATE OAKLAND OAKLAND HAD A FAIRLY -- FOR THE WELL LAID OUT PLAN AROUND SCHOOL CLOSURES AND MY AND MY RECOLLECTION AND AND FORGIVE ME IF I REMEMBER RECOLLECTING CORRECTLY BUT THAT THEY PUNTED ON THAT ISSUE AND SO.IS THAT ONE IS THAT CORRECT IN THE TO WIN WIN TO PUT A DISTRICT AND WITH YOU KNOW UNDER YOUR GUIDANCE IS DOING THAT HOW DO YOU. GET THEM TO THE BACK ON THE CONTRACT. WELL A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT THAT DISTRICT GUIDE I BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE MORE IN THE MIX TO LOOK AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY MADE SOME DECISIONS ON SCHOOL CLOSURES THAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH WITH THIS YEAR -- TO I THINK THE OTHER ONE THAT THEY'VE LOOKED AT EVEN THE ONES THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT YEAR BECAUSE IT TAKES SOME TIME TO SO I THINK THEY JUST AGREED FOR THIS NEXT FOUR MONTHS OF FUN. AGAIN MISTER A TO FIND FROM FAKE NAKED -- BUT CLEARLY IN OUR WORK. AS I MENTIONED IN INGLEWOOD SO GREAT EXAMPLE OF THOSE FIVE AREAS ONE OF THOSE FACILITIES WERE IT WAS SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT FACILITIES AND SAYING OKAY. HOW MANY FACILITIES YOU HAVE? WHICH ONES DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW WE NEED TO LOOK AT SCHOOL CLOSURES CAN BE LOOK AT SELLING SOME OF THOSE OTHER FACILITIES. OTHER WAYS BECAUSE FACILITIES ARE A LARGE COSTS SO THAT IS IN THE PLAN THAT IS PART OF THE DISCUSSION AGAIN WHICH I THINK IS UNIQUE. ABOUT EIGHTEEN FORTY THIS IS A PUTS US AT THE TABLE WITH ON THE FISCAL AND ACADEMIC SIDE. GREAT DID I TALK ABOUT LOOK AT THE STATE BORDERDEPARTMENT OF THAT KIND OF CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO HAVE ANY YOU WANT TO ADD TO THIS OR NOT OKAY NOW -- JUST [inaudible] TO SELECT. YES -- GO STRAIGHT BACK HERE OR NOT. THIS FIGURE OUT ONE COME UPPER THEY'RE GONNA ACT ACTUALLY PRESENTING ACTION OTHER PERCENT NOT SMOKE WELCOME BACK FOR THAT THANK YOU. BUT HE HAS JUMPED ON THE BED I CAN SEE ABOUT -- IT JUST JUST -- JUST A QUICK. QUESTION TO BOTH THE THE STATE BOARD IN THAT DEPARTMENT OF AND IN TERMS OF THE TRANSPARENCY MEASURES REALLY THANK YOU FOR SOARED HIGHLIGHTING THAT MISTER MISTER SAP. WE APPRECIATE IT ALSO JUST A COMMENT ON THE DASHBOARD THE DASHBOARD LOOKS. I THINK -- VERY GOOD MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE I GUESS VERSION ONE POINT OH IF THE ALL CAPS I THINK IT'S A REALLY GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. BUT JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW P. T. A.'S OR IS IT -- YOU KNOW LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS OR JUST RANDOM PARENTS HOW HOW IT THE INFORMATION IS BEING DIGEST. SO ALL START ON THAT THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN PUT PIECES BUT MISS BECAUSE HONEST MAY HAVE SOMETHING MORE THE DASHBOARD BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY CLOSELY RELATED AND I THINK COMPLEMENTARY -- THAT BUDGET SUMMARY FOR PARENTS IS YET BEING ADOPTED LOCALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS COMING BY JULY FIRST OF THIS COMING YEAR SO AS FAR AS HOW IT'S BEING USED LOCALLY AND HOW PEOPLE ARE REACTING TO IT LOCALLY AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WE REALLY DON'T HAVE. MUCH INFORMATION ON THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN AND THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION REALLY TOOK THE LEAD ON DEVELOPING THE FORMAT FOR THAT THERE WAS SOME CLEAR GUIDANCE IN THE BILLING WHICH FROM LAST YEAR -- BUT GETTING SOME FEEDBACK FROM FROM DIFFERENT USERS AND I THINK. UNIFORMLY IT'S BEEN GENERALLY POSITIVE AS FAR AS THE THE RIGHT GRAIN SIZES MAY BE HOW I WOULD PUT IT AS FAR AS THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST. GUY CRITICISMS I GUESS I WOULD PUT IT OF THE EL CAP A PRIOR TO TWO YEARS AGO WAS IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE ACTIONS AND SERVICES AND EXPENDITURES PROPOSING THE ALL CAPS. FIT INTO THE ALLEY IS OVERALL BUDGET THIS DOCUMENT THIS NEW DOCUMENT KIND OF PULLS TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE. THAT CONNECTION TO THE LOCAL BUDGET WHICH WAS KIND OF INTENDED THAT THAT OUT THE LOCAL COUNTY THE PLAN SUPPOSED TO BE. SERVE THE OPERATIONAL PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTING THE LIKELY ADOPTED BUDGET IT REALLY BUILT THAT LINKAGE BUT WITHOUT GOING IT THAT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY PAGE DOCUMENT LIKE IT'S NOT REALISTIC THAT ANYONE. NORMAL PERSON IS GOING TO DIG INTO THAT SO THIS IS A THREE PAGE DOCUMENT THAT REALLY GIVES THOSE HIGH LEVEL SUMMARIES OVERALL BUDGET PICTURE WHAT'S IN THE EL CAP. AND WHAT'S TIED TO INCREASE IMPROVE SERVICES FOR HIGH NEED STUDENTS. AS WELL AS AN UPDATE ON WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE PRIOR YEAR FOR INCREASED IMPROVE SERVICES WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS. YEAH WAS IT DID YOU DO WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO SO IN GENERAL AS FAR AS LIKE THOSE KEY TOPICS I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN GENERALLY BUT IT'S NOT FROM THE END USER. WHICH IS REALLY PARENTS SO I THINK WE'LL LEARN A LOT MORE AFTER THIS SORT OF CYCLE COMES AROUND. ON THE BRIGHTER UPDATES TO THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN -- THAT IS FOR THAN THE UPCOMING EL CAPITAN OPTION NOT THE ONE RIGHT NOW BUT FOR THE NEXTEL CAP THE BOARD'S ACTUALLY CAN BE. ADOPTING THE NEW TEMPLATE WE'RE HOPING BY NOVEMBER. OF THIS YEAR AND SO WE'VE ALREADY STARTED OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF RESERVED TIME TO DO THAT BIG STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. ON SOME OF THE KEY AGAIN THE STATURE LANGUAGE WAS. VERY SPECIFIC IN SOME REGARDS SO THERE ISN'T A GREAT DEAL OF DISCRETION ON SOME PIECES BUT TO TRY TO GET FEEDBACK AND SOME OF THOSE KEY DESIGN CHOICES THAT THE BOARD WILL HAVE TO MAKE. AS FAR AS HOW TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION AS YOU TRY TO GET IT I THINK THE ISSUE WAS HOW LONG THE DOCUMENT IS. SOME OF THAT ISN'T SOLVABLE COMPLETELY BUT THERE MAY BE SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN REALLY TRY TO MAKE IT MORE DIGESTIBLE DOCUMENT. EVEN IF THE OVERALL DOCUMENT STILL HAS SOME LENGTH YOU CAN PULL OUT MAYBE SEVEN EIGHT PAGES. THEY GIVE A FULLPICTURE OF WHAT'S BEEN SORT OF ADOPTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IT ENDED JUST STATE GUY AGAIN YEAH THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE IS REALLY OUR BASS FIRST FOR SHOT AND FIRST GAS AT THE HELPFUL TO GET FEEDBACK IF WE NEED TO MAKE. CHANGES I THINK THERE'S SOME INTEREST IN DOING THAT. I AND ON THE DASHBOARD WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS -- WE DID ENGAGE IN A AS THE LARGE -- STAKEHOLDER INPUT SESSION. NUMBER SESSIONS TO GET TO THE POINT WE'RE AT TODAY I ON THE TRANSPARENCY SIDE I I LIKE TO THINK THAT IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A FORM OF IMITATION OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING A DASHBOARD LIGHT SO WERE SEEN COUNTY OFFICES PICK UP THE DATA THAT WE PUT. PUBLISHED -- OF COURSE ON OUR WEBSITE IN THE DASHBOARD SO I I I THINK WITH JOSH FOR TWO POINT NOW I'M WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN IN AGAIN WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I JUST ONE MORE QUESTION FOR MISTER MOLINA WITH REGARD TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. I THINK YOU MENTIONED YOU DO A SYSTEM AS WELL DO THEY GO DO THEY GO TO THE COUNTY FIRST HOUSE HOW WOULD THAT LOOK BUT WITH THAT WHATEVER THEY'RE NOT IDENTIFIED YET NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE FIRST YEAR -- IDENTIFIED IN THE DASHBOARD SO WE HAVE DONE SOME WORK WITH THEM AND NOT SPECIFICALLY RUN DIFFERENCE IN ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU FOR YEAH. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MICHAEL FIND FROM A FAKE MATT. AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR I'M SURE YOU HAVE YOUR PREPARED REMARKS BUT ALSO IF YOU COULD. MAYBE GIVE US A GLIMPSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE TALK ABOUT THE REAL WORLD TODAY -- AND HOW YOU MIGHT BE INTERACTING WITH THOSE DISTRICTS THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE IN FULL CRISIS MODE YET. WHAT ROLE YOU MIGHT PLATE SETTER? GOOD MORNING MIKE FINE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE STATE'S FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM. MATCH -- MY OUTLINE IS COMING AROUND TO YOU AND I THINK -- MISTER CHAIR IT WILL -- RELEASED THE FIRST SECTION GIVE YOU A A GOOD FLAVOR OF WHERE THINGS ARE APT AT LEAST THROUGH DECEMBER. AND I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH THOSE IT'S QUITE A BIT OF DATA HERE -- I'LL BE QUICK -- BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS QUESTIONS AND AND THAT MAYBE THE MORE PIECE OF OF MY TIME THIS MORNING. FIRST THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE -- SCHOOL DISTRICT GIVE US STABILITY IS MEASURED THROUGH -- WHAT WE GENERALLY REFER TO AS THE A. B. TWELVE HUNDRED PROCESS SAYS THE COMMITTEES WILL WHERE -- WHILE THAT STARTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY ONE WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWELVE HUNDRED THERE'S BEEN FORTY PLUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION SINCE THAT TWEAK IT IN SOME FASHION WE STILL REFERRED TO THAT OVERALL PROCESS IS THE AB TWELVE HUNDRED PROCESS. INTER COAL IN THAT PROCESS IS THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM -- WERE DISTRICTS SUBMIT THEIR BUDGETS TO THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE AND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS CONSIDER APPROVING APPROVING WITH CONDITIONS ARE DISAPPROVING THE BUDGET THAT HAPPENS EACH SUMMER -- AND THEN THERE'S A MINIMUM AT LEAST TO UPDATE TO THAT BUDGET -- FIRST IN ROOM WHICH IS DATA THROUGH OCTOBER DONE IN DECEMBER. AND SECOND IN ARM DATA THROUGH JANUARY I DONE IN MARCH. AND THE DATA THAT I'M PRESENTING TO THIS COMMITTEE IS THROUGH FIRST IN ROME BECAUSE SECOND INTERIM DATA ISN'T DUE UNTIL -- TELL FRIDAY OF THIS WEEK AND SO WE'RE JUST TIMING OF THE HEARING THIS. IS JUST A SLIGHTLY OFF FROM BEING ABLE TO REPORT ON SECOND IN A ROOM -- SO FIRST IN A ROOM IN ALL ALL SPEAK IN GENERALITIES ABOUT IMPLICATIONS SECOND AND ARMY HAVE THAT FIRST IN A ROOM -- AND THERE YOU HAVE IN YOUR STAFF REPORT PLUS IN THE MATERIAL I JUST GAVE YOU A DETAILS OF OF ALL OF THIS BUT WE HAVE THIRTY NINE QUALIFIED SELF CERTIFICATIONS -- I I SHOULD PAUSE AND REMIND YOU THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS SELF CERTIFY THEIR FIRST THEIR IN ARMOR PORTS AS POSITIVE MEANING -- THEY CAN MEET THEIR FINANCIAL CURRENT PLUS TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS. QUALIFIED WHICH MEANS THEY MAY NOT MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN THE CURRENT IN TWO SUBSEQUENT YEARS IN NEGATIVE WHICH MEANS THEY WILL NOT MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN AND EITHER THE CURRENT FOR SINGLE SUBSEQUENT YEAR -- AND SO IT'S THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS JOB -- AS THE ANALYZE AND EVALUATE THOSE INTO REPORTS TO CONCUR OR NOT CONCUR -- WITH THAT CERTIFICATION AND SO YOU'LL AS ALL SPEAK TO IN JUST A SECOND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT CAN CHANGE THATCERTIFICATION ASK HIM THE CD -- SO THERE WERE -- THIRTY NINE SELF QUALIFIED SELF CERTIFICATIONS AT FIRST IN A ROOM. IN ADDITION THE COUNTY THREE COUNTY OFFICES DOWNGRADED THREE DISTRICTS FROM POSITIVE TO QUALIFY TO HAVE A TOTAL OF FORTY TWO QUALIFIED. DISTRICTS AT FIRST INTERIM INTERESTS ENOUGH THAT'S THE EXACT NUMBER THAT WE HAD A YEAR AGO AT FIRST DETERMINES WELL -- THE THREE COUNTY OFFICE DOWNGRADES -- I INCLUDE ONE IN MARIN BUT ONE ALAMEDA WHICH IS OAKLAND -- AND ONE IN RIVERSIDE. THERE WERE FOUR NEGATIVE SELF CERTIFICATIONS WHICH ARE THE SAME NUMBER THAT WE HAD A YEAR AGO -- HOWEVER AS I'VE SPOKEN THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST THE THE BEAUTY OF AB TWELVE HUNDRED YES THAT IT'S ACTUALLY SYSTEM THAT WORKS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING WORKS REALLY WELL. WE HAVE A DISTRICT THAT GETS ALL THE WAY TO THE NEGATIVE -- CERTIFICATION -- STATUS -- THERE ARE NUMEROUS INTERVENTION RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THAT DISTRICT AND SELDOM DO THEY STAY ON THE NEGATIVE LISTS MORE THAN ONE REPORTING PERIOD. AND SO ALL THE NUMBERS THE SAME AS LAST -- DISTRICTS -- ON THE NEGATIVE LIST ARE DIFFERENT -- AND ONE I WILL SPEAK TO IT'S BEEN ON THE NEGATIVE LIST ACTUALLY FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND AND WE'RE GETTING TO THE END OF OUT. THE THREE NEW ANSWER SACRAMENTO CITY SOUTHERN KERN IN SWEETWATER UNION -- IN SAN DIEGO. ONE IS CONTINUING WHICH IS FEATHER FALLS UNION ELEMENTARY YOU WILL SEE FEATHER FALL SHOW UP SEVERAL TIMES IN MY REPORT -- NOT TO BE ALARMED THIS IS A SINGLE DISTRICT SCHOOL BY SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN BUTTE COUNTY WITH TEN K. A WITH TEN STUDENTS FIVE OF WHICH ARE IN THE EIGHTH GRADE IF THEY BET ON THE NEGATIVE LIST NOW FOR MULTIPLE YEARS. ALL WITH THE GOAL TO GET. HALF OF THEIR STUDENTS WHICH ARE ALL IN THE SAME GRADE -- THROUGH PROMOTION THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE PROMOTION THIS JUNE. AT WHICH POINT IN TIME IN NEIGHBORING THE PLAN IS THAT A NEIGHBORING DISTRICT WILL BEGIN TO SERVE THE REMAINING. STUDENTS IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL BASICALLY CEASE TO OPERATE SO THERE'S THEY ARE NOT ON OUR RADAR SCREEN WITH RESPECT TO ANTICIPATED INTERVENTION. NEEDED BY -- THE STATE THE COUNTY HAS BEEN ASSISTING THEM FINANCIALLY -- BUT THIS IS THIS IS BEEN DRAWN OUT REALLY SO THAT WE COULD ADEQUATELY SERVE -- FIVE OF THEIR TENTS PROMOTION IT AT EIGHTH GRADE WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE MOVED ON TO THE HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE HAVE ONE LACK OF GOING CONCERN DISTRICT -- THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION HOWEVER -- THIS IS WHERE THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT CAN MOVE A DISTRICT TO THAT STATUS AT ANY TIME DURING THE YEAR NOT JUST OF THE INTERIM REPORTING -- BUDGET REPORTING STAFF -- TIME PERIODS BUT AT ANY TIME THIS WAS ACTUALLY DONE IN NOVEMBER THIS IS ALBERT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. WE ALSO HAVE IN THE SYSTEM SHOW UP VERY OFTEN BUT WE HAVE ONE NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION FOR A COUNTY OFFICE AMADOR COUNTY OFFICE. OF THE DID SUBMIT QUALIFIED -- THE DEPARTMENT OF ED IS THE OVERSIGHT AGENCY FOR COUNTY OFFICES AND THEY DOWNGRADED THEM. TO A NEGATIVE THIS IS A SINGLE DISTRICT COUNTY SO AMADOR UNIFIED AMADOR COUNTY THEY ARE CLOSELY LINKED COMMON BOARD. AS OF JANUARY THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SUPERINTENDENTS THOUGH THEY HAVE FOR THE MOST RECENT PERIOD TIME AN OPERATING WITH A SINGLE SUPERINTENDENT. OF BOTH -- BUT NOW OF THROUGH THE THE ELECTION PROCESS -- THERE'S A NEW COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT -- THE DISTRICT ITSELF MOVING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION THE COUNTIES MOVING IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION -- AN INTERVENTION. WE JUST HAD A TEAM THERE WILL BE ISSUED A REPORT -- ON THAT -- SINGLE ENTITY OF THE COUNTY DISTRICT COME HERE AND IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. I GIVES YOU A OF FLAVOR WHAT'S OUT THERE VERY SIMILAR NUMBER WISE TO LAST YEAR -- HOWEVER SOME OF THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE ON THE LIST -- ARE ARE DIFFERENT -- BOTH IN -- SIZE AND MAGNITUDE. ARMED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ISSUES THAT THEY'RE FACING A WILL CERTAINLY -- CAN CAN DIG INTO SOME OF THAT -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AS THE COMMITTEE IS AWARE THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET ACT -- PROVIDED THAT VIC MATCH MORE -- PROVIDE MORE PREVENT EVE -- ON A PROACTIVE BASIS -- INTERVENTION IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS HISTORICALLY WE HAVE ONLY INTERVENED IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT WHEN ASKED TO COME INTO THE DISTRICT BY THE DISTRICT FOR THE COUNTY OFFICE OR ASKED TO GO THERE BY -- THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE LEGISLATURE IN SOME FASHION. AND SO IN AN AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THIS -- IDEA ABOUT BE MORE PROACTIVE WE HAVE -- THIS YEAR PRACTICED A NEW PROCESS THAT WE CALL AUTOMATIC ENGAGEMENT IN THAT AUTOMATIC ENGAGEMENT BY US IS UNDER CERTAIN TRIGGERS THOSE ARE LISTED THERE DISAPPROVE BUDGET. A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION ON IN ARMOR PORT THREE CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED -- CERTIFICATIONS A DOWNGRADE BY EITHER THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OR THE DEPARTMENT OF ED OR A LACK OF GOING CONCERN DESIGNATION BY THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. THE TOOL THAT WE USE WHEN WE GO IN TO THE DISTRICT IS THE FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS IT'S A TOOL WE DEVELOP MANY YEARS AGO. WE'VE DONE SOME PRETTY EXTENSIVE UPGRADES AND MODERNIZATION TO THAT TOOL THIS PAST SUMMER AND USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE DISTRICTS IN THE FALL -- USE THE UPDATED TOOL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE DISTRICTS THIS FALL. THIS YEAR THERE WERE SIX APPROACH DISAPPROVE BUDGETS ACROSS THE STATE THAT'S UP FROM TO THE PRIOR YEAR. AND WE PERFORMED BY FISCAL RISK HEALTH ANALYSIS IN THREE OF THOSE CALAVERAS WHERE WE DETERMINE THEIR RISK WAS MODERATE SACRAMENTO CITY WHERE WE DETERMINE THEIR RISK WAS HIGH. SWEETWATER UNION -- IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHERE WE DETERMINE THEIR RISK WAS HIGH AS WELL. AT FIRST IN A ROOM. THERE ARE AS I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THERE ARE FOUR NEGATIVE CERTIFICATIONS. WE JUST PERFORMED FISCAL RISKY HEALTH ANNOUNCES THAT TWO OF THOSE SPECIFICALLY SACKS CITY AND SWEET WATER JUST A COUPLE MONTHS EARLIER AND SO THERE'S NO NEED TO PERFORM THAT SAME STUDY AGAIN. TWO OF THE OTHERS WE ARE MONITORING ONE OF THOSE A SOUTHERN KERN AND THE OTHER AS I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED IS FEATHER FALLS WHICH AT THIS POINT WE WOULDN'T DESCRIBE. WHETHER WHETHER QUALIFY FOR NEGATIVE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THEY HAVE A PLAN TO ACCEPT OUT OF NEXT FISCAL YEAR. SOUTHERN KERN -- CURRENTLY HAS A LOAN OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN TO THE LEGISLATURE AS AN INSOLVENT DISTRICT -- REQUIRING AN EMERGENCY PREPARATION IT'S COUNTY OFFICES STEPPED IN TO PROVIDE IT THE CASH RESOURCES. THAT IT NEEDS WHILE YET -- RECTIFY ITS CURRENT SITUATION. WE HAVE THREE CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED CERTIFICATION I'M SORRY OF THE THREE CONCERT WELL THAT'S NOT COMING OUT RIGHT AT ALL THE OTHER ANOTHER TRIGGER IS THREE CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED CERTIFICATIONS WE HAVE SIX OF THOSE. WE HAVE SCHEDULED TO VISIT THREE OF THOSE DISTRICTS -- COACHELLA VALLEY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY CLIMATE TRINITY AND HUMBOLDT OCEANSIDE IN SAN DIEGO. CAN WE ARE MONITORING -- THREE BUT WE HAVE NOT SCHEDULED THOSE REVIEWS THOSE INCLUDE GOLD TRAIL UNION IN EL DORADO. IN CASCADE UNION AND GATEWAY BOTH IN SHASTA COUNTY. WE ARE -- USING OUR DISCRETION NOT JUST FOLLOWING EXACTLY THE TRIGGER IF YOU WILL -- WE ARE IN COMMUNICATION BOTH WITH THE DISTRICT AND IT'S COUNTY OFFICE TO SAY -- WHILE THEY'VE MET THE TRIGGER -- IF WE COME IN AND DO THIS STUDY DO WE REALLY THINK IT'S GOING TO ADD VALUE WHAT IS WHAT ARE THE DRIVING -- FORCES IF CURRENT DISTRESS -- AND WILL THIS TOOL HELP THEM -- BE A A POSITIVE INTERVENTION FORM AND WHERE WE HAVEN'T FELT THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE CASE WE'RE NOT TAKING THE TIME WERE. THERE'S OTHER INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND WE'RE MONITORING THEM IN THAT REGARD. AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE ONE LACK A GOING CONCERN ALFORD UNIFIED RIVERSIDE COUNTY -- AND WITH THEIR FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS IS ALSO SCHEDULED HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS -- THE THREE DOWNGRADED -- DISTRICTS -- ALL OF THOSE ARE BEING MONITORED -- AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE IN THE CASE OF OAKLAND -- WE ACTUALLY DID A FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS THEIR YEAR AND A HALF AGO -- WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN OAKLAND ON A DAILY BASIS -- FOR THE LAST -- CERTAINLY EIGHT MONTHS AND WELL REALLY ALMOST OVER A YEAR NOW -- TRULY OF HAD A MEMBER OF PRESENT IN THE DISTRICT CAN ALL SPEAK TO THEM MORE. MORE DIRECTLY -- IN THE NEXT SECTION. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FORTY IS THE COMMITTEE SO WHERE WAS BUDGET TRAILER BILL LAST AUGUST IT INCLUDED -- SOME POLICY CHANGES WHICH CHANGE THE LONG STANDING -- PROCESS ON HOW -- A DISTRICT. THE IS ADMINISTERED ONCE IT COMES TO THE LEGISLATURE -- FOR AN EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION PREVIOUSLY -- HE GOVERNING AUTHORITY ALL THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE GOVERNING BOARD WERE SHIFTED -- TO THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT ONCE. THE STATE -- A GRANTED AN EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION UNDER EIGHTEEN FORTY THOSE RIGHTS AND DUTIES ARE SHIFTED TO THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. IT'S THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IN -- CONCERT WITH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT IN THE BOARD OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THAT NOW APPOINT TO STATE ADMINISTRATOR STATE TRUSTEE WHATEVER'S WARRANTED. ON A AND IT'S THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT THE ON A DAILY BASIS AND INTERACTS WITH THE DISTRICT ON A DAILY BASIS. THE FIRST ARE REQUIRED REPORTING UNDER EIGHTEEN FORTY WAS LAST FRIDAY MARCH FOR IT WILL NOT LAST FRIDAY THE FRIDAY BEFORE MARCH FIRST AND WE DID ISSUE TWO LETTERS -- ONE FOR OAKLAND ONE FOR INGLEWOOD -- INC IN -- COMPLIANCE WITH THAT REQUIREMENT -- IN INGLEWOOD I THINK IS A STORY AND YOU HEARD -- TOM R. MOLINA SPEAK TO IT OF A FEW MINUTES AGO IN INGLEWOOD WE HAVE A SUCCESS STORY REALLY UNDER EIGHTEEN FORTY I WOULD DESCRIBING THE WOOD IS. HAVING MADE MOREPROGRESS IN THE LAST -- SIX MONTHS UNDER THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS DALY DIRECTION THAN THEY MADE IN QUITE A BIT OF TIME UNDER THE PREVIOUS STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S -- DALY DIRECTION -- THIS IS -- I'VE I I MENTIONED WE MENTIONED IN OUR REPORT ISSUED ON MARCH FIRST THAT WHILE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS DID NOT ASK FOR EIGHTEEN FORTY IN FACT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE. ADVOCATED AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS PASSED IN THOSE DUTIES WERE ASSIGNED TO HER SHE FULLY EMBRACE THEM BUSINESS MADE A TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT OF STAFF. IN LEADERSHIP AND TIME -- IN HELPING INGLEWOOD AND THAT PROCESS IS ACTUALLY GOING VERY WELL WE ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATING THEIR DEFICIT THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE EIGHTEEN FORTY AID AS ROUGHLY ONE POINT THREE THE MINOR. NUMBER -- WITH RESPECT TO OAKLAND -- I WOULD SAY PROCESSES AS NOTED HERE PROGRESS HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT THE COUNTY OFFICE AGAIN FOR BY HAS EMBRACED THEIR ROLE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY IT IS DIFFERENT IN THOSE TWO DISTRICTS WERE OFTEN LUMP THEM TOGETHER AND LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS. BUT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT REMEMBER THAT ANGLE WOULD -- HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS PROCESS NOW FOR SIX YEARS AND IS ACTUALLY GOVERNED BY A STATE ADMINISTRATOR NOW REPORTING TO THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. OAKLAND GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWO THOUSAND THREE WENT THROUGH THAT INTENSE RECOVERY PROCESS WERE CERTIFIED IS RECOVERED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A FORTY WAS RETURNED TO THEM FOR OVER A DECADE. AND THEN QUESTIONS BEGAN TO SURFACE LAST YEAR ABOUT THEIR FISCAL STATUS. ARM AND SO THEY HAVE A TRUSTEE IN PLACE BUT THERE LOCAL BOARD -- IS GOVERNING THE DISTRICT AND THEY HAVE A SUPERINTENDENT IN PLACE HIRED BY THAT LOCAL BOARD. HE'S A TEACHER JUST COULD YOU TELL. EXPLAIN WHY. WHY THERE'D BE A A TRUSTEE THERE IN THE LOCAL MORE WOULD RETAIN?-SO THAT IS THE LONG ESTABLISHED PROCESS THE STATE UNTIL THEY PAY OFF THEIR LOAN THE STATE CLEARLY HAS AN INTEREST IN THEIR FISCAL STABILITY BECAUSE IN OAKLAND CASE THEY NEED TO MAKE IT EIGHT MILLION PLUS. PAYMENT EACH YEAR TO THE STATE -- A COMBINATION OF STATE GENERAL FUND LOAN AND I BANK LOAN -- AND SO IT'S IN THE STATE'S INTEREST -- TO HAVE A TRUSTY IN PLACE IT HAS STAINED RESCIND AUTHORITY SHOULD THE DISTRICTS DEVIATE FROM ITS FINANCIAL STABILITY PLAN -- AND THEREFORE PUT THAT LOAN PAYMENT AT JEOPARDY IN JEOPARDY -- AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE DISTINCTION -- GOVERNANCE LEADERSHIP -- IN OTHER DISTRICTS CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO HAVE DEFICIENCIES -- DATA LACKS CREDIBILITY -- WE AS AN ORGANIZATION -- THERE ON ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS IN SOME FASHION -- DO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF THIS CURRENT -- FISCAL DISTRESS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL AID HOWEVER WE HAVE ESTIMATED -- FOR EIGHTEEN FORTY PURPOSES THAT THEY'RE PROJECTED DEFICIT FOR NEXT YEAR IS SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- THIS PROJECTION IS BEFORE THEY SETTLED THEIR MOST RECENT. LABOR -- NEGOTIATIONS AND BEFORE THEIR BOARD ADOPTED BUDGET REDUCTIONS -- THEIR SETTLEMENT CAME EVENING ON THE DAY BEFORE OUR REPORT WAS DUE -- AND THEY'RE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD -- CAME THE WEEK THE THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND SO WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE WILL RE ISSUE ARE MARCH FIRST. LETTER ON OAKLAND I'M IN THE COMING WEEKS -- TO REFLECT OF BOTH OF THOSE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE AN UPDATE THIS DEFICIT CALCULATION. SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN ARM. WITH FISCAL EMERGENCIES OBVIOUSLY INGLEWOOD WE'VE MENTIONED WELL WE'VE JUST STARTED THE SEVENTH COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW -- AS THE COMMITTEES AWARE WHEN A DISTRICT IS. BEFORE THEY RECOVER -- FIX MATT DOES AN ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF THAT REFERRED TO AND IN THE COMMENTS ON THE PANEL BEFORE ME -- WE LOOK AT UNDER CODE WE LOOK AT FIVE AREAS STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT WHICH YOU TALKED WITH THE PANEL BEFORE ME ABOUT. OF FISCAL MATTERS FACILITY MATTERS HUMAN RESOURCE MATTERS AND THEN A COMBINATION OF GOVERNANCE AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS MATTERS. AND WE ISSUE REPORTS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PAGES LONG WITH HUNDREDS OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN IT. A WE JUST BEGAN THE WORK FOR THE SEVEN BEGIN LAST WEEK -- AS WE TACKLE THE AREA OF GOVERNANCE. SWEETWATER UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT -- I THINK IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS A STARTED TO TURN THE CORNER. I THINK THE MOST FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUES IN SWEETWATER -- HAS BEEN A BOARD NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THE GOVERNING BOARD NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM. AND THEY HAVE STARTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND ONCE WE GET THROUGH THAT IF YOU WILL STEP ONE ON THAT RECOVERY PROCESS ADMITTING THAT WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM -- DAN HELP DUMB AND PROGRESS -- BECOMES VERY APPARENTFAIRLY QUICKLY -- AFTER THAT IN IN CONVERSATIONS BOTH FRIDAY AND YESTERDAY -- TO REALLY GET AN UPDATE ON WHERE THEY'RE OUT -- WE WE SEE SOME PROGRESS CITY. MISTER CHAIR PERFECT TIMING -- NO THIS OF INTEREST TO YOU SACRAMENTO CITY -- THE ABILITY TO AVOID -- INTERVENTION AND EMERGENCY LOAN FRANKLY IS QUESTIONABLE -- WATER LOCAL MEDIA COVERAGE I THINK YOU'RE ALL SENSITIVE TO THEIR A GREAT ARTICLE OVER THE WEEKEND THAT I THINK SUMMARIZED -- IN THE SACK BE KIND OF SUMMARIZE WHERE THEY'VE BEEN A WHERE -- WHERE THEY'RE OUT RIGHT NOW -- THEIR ORIGINAL PROJECTION THAT THEY WOULD BE OUT OF CASH IN NOVEMBER AND THEREFORE REQUIRED EMERGENCY PREPARATION A PROCESS THAT WE WOULD -- PROBABLY INITIATED THE MADE A JUNE TIME PERIOD -- WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- RIGHT NOW PROBABLY IS MOVED OUT ONE OR TWO MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE TIMING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR FIRST SET OF CUTS. ON THAT THEY IDENTIFIED JUST LAST WEEK WE'VE NOT EVALUATED THOSE CUTS THEIR FRESH AT THIS POINT. ON THEY WILL BE CRITICAL -- TO MOVING FORWARD ISSUE APPRECIATE MANY OF THOSE CUTS WILL BEGIN TO TAKE EFFECT TILL JULY FIRST. WHICH IS A VERY SHORT WINDOW BETWEEN -- JULY FIRST IN THE TIME THAT THERE COULD. TO RUN OUT OF CASH. OVERALL ACROSS THE STATE. FROM SOLVENCY TRANS MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THEIR MULTI YOUR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS DO SHOW SOME DEFICIT TRENDS -- MANY OF HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF DEALING WITH -- PROJECTED DEFICITS BY TAKING APPROPRIATE ACTION EARLY IN THE PROCESS -- I THINK WHAT'S COMMON AMONG THE DISTRICTS THAT -- WE OFTEN SEE IN FISCAL DISTRESSES THEY'VE NOT BEEN -- AS PROACTIVE THEY'VE NOT ACTED QUICK ENOUGH -- IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING CONDITIONS WHETHER THAT'S DECLINING ENROLLMENT -- HIGHER -- HIGHER EXPENSES ARE EXPENSES GROWING AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE REVENUE -- AND SO ON BUT MOST DISTRICTS WILL DEAL WITH THAT VERY EFFECTIVELY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ON THROUGH THEIR GOVERNANCE TEAM. WITH RESPECT TO EXTRAORDINARY AUDITS -- AB ONE THIRTY NINE EXTRAORDINARY AUDITS IF YOU RECALL MY TESTIMONY LAST YEAR AT THIS POINT TIME WE WERE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED WE HAD -- DOUBLED OUR ALL TIME PEAK WE WERE INTO THE TWENTIES ACTUALLY BY THE TIME WE FINISHED LAST YEAR OF EXTRAORDINARY AUDITS ARE PREVIOUS PEAK HAD BEEN TEN IN A YEAR. AND WE WERE OVER TWENTY LAST YEAR AS RESET FOR WHATEVER REASON -- TREND AS BACK -- TO KIND OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE NORMAL LEVEL OF ACTIVITY ABOUT HALF OF WHAT IT WAS LAST YEAR SO BACK IN THAT THAT TEN ALTHOUGH TEN PROBABLY IS A STRETCH FOR ME TO CALL THAT NORMAL. GIVEN THAT HAD BEEN OUR PREVIOUS PEAK ARM WE HAVE ONE HIGH PROFILE -- AUDIT THAT'LL BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS IT'S IN ITS -- GOING THROUGH ITS EDITING IMPAIR OF YOU PROCESS RIGHT NOW. AND WE HAVE ONE HIGH FOR PROFILE AUDIT SPECIFICALLY SWEETWATER UNION -- THAT IS JUST BEGINNING WHICH IS STUDIED UP PARTIAL ENTRANCE -- CONFERENCE ON THAT -- MATTER YESTERDAY. WITHOUT A BE HAPPY TO ANSWER-QUESTIONS. MR DONNA I THANK YOU ARE WITH REGARD TO CHARTERS DID YOU PLAY A ROLE -- IN IN IN IN THE FISCAL OVERSIGHT OF CHARTERS AND WHAT MIGHT TRIGGER THAT ARE THEY SUBJECT AB TWELVE HUNDRED SHOULD THEY BE SUBJECT AB. TWELVE HUNDRED GREAT QUESTION SO OUR OUR ROLE IS IS A LITTLE BIT MIX THERE -- THE AB TWELVE HUNDRED PROCESS FOR CHARTERS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A BUDGET TO THEIR AUTHORIZING -- BODY WHETHER IT'S A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR COUNTY OFFICE -- THEY ARE RESPONSE RESPONSIBLE -- FOR TO SUBMIT IN ARMOR PORT HE IS -- DIFFERENT THAN AN ALLEY A THERE ARE NOT PENALTIES ARE CONSEQUENCES WHEN THEY FAIL TO DO THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE RIGHT NOW -- WHERE THE CHARTERS REFUSED TO SUBMIT A A FIRST IN A REPORT DUE BACK IN DECEMBER AS AN EXAMPLE -- SO THE SAME PENALTIES APPLY TO TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SHOOL DON'T APPLY TO THEM -- OUR INVOLVEMENT IS -- MULTI FULL FIRST OFF WE HAVE PUBLISHED A LOT OF GUIDANCE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS WE'RE THE PUBLISHER. OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL COUNTY MANUAL -- WE ARE THE PUBLISHER OF THE AUTHOR I SEARCH CHECK LIST SO -- AGENCIES THAT AUTHORIZED CHARTERS THEIR OVERSIGHT PROCESS A CHECKLIST TO CONDUCT THEIR OVERSIGHT -- ALL ALL AVAILABLE ON OUR WEB PAGE WE DO ON CHARTERS ARE INCLUDED IN ALL OF OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT -- WE PROVIDE THEM ADVICE JUST LIKE WE DO ANY OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT -- BUT THEY ARE. THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE AB TWELVE HUNDRED PROCESS WERE -- IF THEY'RE HAVING FISCAL DISTRESS THAT THEY CAN COME TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR AN EMERGENCY PREPARATION -- THEY ARE NOT GUARANTEED -- THEY HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF GUARANTEES THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES TO K. TWELVE IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF PARTNERS -- THOSE -- DE THESE -- AND SO THE STATE BE IN ESSENCE BECOMES THE GUARANTEE YEAR OF THEIR OPERATIONS WHICH IS WHY WE GET INTO THE WHOLE IDEA OF A OF A STATE EMERGENCY APPORTIONMENT -- CHARTERS COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US BANKRUPTCY -- LAWSON AND SOME OTHER AREAS SO IT'S A IT'S A MIX -- CHARTERS ARE OFTEN THE SUBJECT OF AUDIT REQUEST THAT WE GET -- HOWEVER THAT IS -- ACTUALLY DOWN QUITE A BIT -- FROM BUT WHILE VERY MENTIONED TOTAL WATER DOWN EXTRAORDINARY OUT TO DOWN FROM LAST YEAR -- THEY WOULD BE TRUE FOR BOTH CHARTERS AND REGULAR -- NOT REGULAR BUT MORE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WITH REGARD TO SACK CITY YOU MAY KNOW THIS ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD YOU MAY NOT HOW LONG. ARE THEY QUALIFY NOW ARE THEY NEGATIVE NO HERE NEGATIVE THEIR NEGATIVE THEY HAD A IS ON ROUTE BUDGET IN THE SUMMER. AND THEN -- THEIR FIRST IN ARM THEY FILED NEGATIVE LAST WEEK AND IT WAS ALSO NEGATIVE. THERE COUNTY BUSES THAT DOES HAVE YOUR NEGATIVE. THE KIND OF THE WAY IT WORKS -- YES THERE ISN'T REALLY A DOWNGRADE FROM NEGATIVE -- SO PRETTY NOW -- THAT IN SOME RESPECTS COUNTY DOESN'T GET A CHOICE ON THAT YOU BUT YES THAT NEGATIVE HIS FAULT IN THEIR CASE BOTH THE FIRST ENORMOUS SECOND IN OUR NEGATIVES WERE FILED -- IN CONCERT WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT COUNTY IF YOU SUBMIT A BUDGET THAT YOU SEE AS POSITIVE AS ACTUALLY QUALIFIED OR NEGATIVE THE COUNTY. WOULDN'T CAN DOWNGRADE THAT COULD DOWNGRADE THAT SWEAT WHERE THEY WHERE THEY WERE THEY'RE A YEAR AGO. TWO YEARS AGO DO YOU KNOW -- TWO YEARS I'LL HAVE TO LOOK UP -- LAST YEAR AT THIS POINT IN TIME I BELIEVE THEY WERE POSITIVE -- THE PROCESS BEGAN LAST NOVEMBER OF SEVENTEEN SO JUST OVER A YEAR AGO -- WELL THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE COUNTY IN THE DISTRICT WHERE THE COUNTY EXPRESSED CONCERNS BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY -- IN RELATIONSHIP TO APPROVAL OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND EARLY DECEMBER OF SEVENTEEN ON THE COUNTY EXPRESSED IN AFFORDABILITY CONCERN -- DID THAT AGAIN AT THEIR FIRST IN ROME THEIR SECOND IN AROUND THE DISTRICT WAS UNRESPONSIVE TO THOSE ITEMS -- AND WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR UP BUDGET APPROVAL -- IN THE SUMMER FOR THE NEW THE NEW FOR BUDGET. WHICH IS -- IN SOME RESPECTS ONE OF THE HIGHER LEVELS OF INTERVENTION A COUNTY CAN TAKE THE CODE THEN PROVIDES FOR A PROCESS TO BE FOLLOWED. FULL TIME LINE AND WHO'S INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS ONCE A BUDGETS DISAPPROVED -- COUNTY SIMPLY DOWNGRADED IN IN A REPORT IT KIND OF STOPS THERE OTHER THAN INTERVENTION -- MAKE MAY COME INTO PLAY -- BUT DISAPPROVAL OF A BUDGET OBVIOUSLY THE DISTRICT AT THAT POINT DOESN'T HAVE A EXPENDITURES FORTY THERE HAVE APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY. WHEN WHEN WHAT WHEN THE BUDGETS DISAPPROVED EARLY AND SO LOCAL BOARD APPROVES IT? THEY VOTE ON IT. THEN THEY SUBMITTED TO THE COUNTY YES BY JULY FIRST THE COUNTY GOES THROUGH AN EVALUATION PROCESS A CHECKLIST PROCESS. AN ANALYSIS PROCESS AND THEN MAKES A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THEY CAN. APPROVE IT APPROVE IT WITH CONDITIONS OR DISAPPROVE IT THOSE ARE THE THREE CHOICES A COUNTY HOUSE. AND THEY DISAPPROVE IT. THEY THIS CASE THEY DID DISAPPROVE THAT'S CORRECT. AND THAT WHAT HAPPENS THAT -- THAT SETS A BOTH A TIME LINE IN A PROCESS THAT. IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AD CODE -- FOR A BUDGET REVIEW COMMITTEE TO BE -- ADDENDA FI -- THE CORRECTIVE ACTION THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN AND THEN -- IN ESSENCE RESUBMITTED TO THE COUNTY. THAT BUDGET REVIEW COMMISSION PROCESS -- CAN BE WAIVED AND IN FACT. I THINK WE JUST DETERMINED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IT'S BEEN WAIVED IN ALL CASES BUT ONE AND SO -- THE WAIVER PROVIDES GENERALLY THE PARTIES -- A LITTLE LESS FORMAL RESOLUTION PROCESS AND IT GIVES THEM AN EXTRA THIRTY DAYS TO ACHIEVE THAT WHEN YOU WAVE IT BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME. CONSTRAINTS EVEN WITHOUT THE BUDGET REVIEW -- COMMITTEE PROCESS. THANK YOU. SURE CAN I CLASS THE FOLLOW UP ON THIS FOR FOR SACRAMENTO REAL QUICK. SO I I JUST WANTED TO TO ASK IT AND OVERALL QUESTION BEFORE I GET THE SACRAMENTO. I KNOW YOU YOU'VE BEEN HERE WITH THIS CHART FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND IT'S SOMEWHAT -- ON THE QUITE. A QUITE ACCURATE PICTURE BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IF YEARS AGO WE STILL HAD. ROUGHLY FORTY DISTRICTS ARE QUALIFIED AND A HANDFUL THAT WERE NEGATIVE AND NOW WE HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT THAT ARE QUALIFIED AND DOUBLE THAT THERE ARE NEGATIVE [inaudible] BUT WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS IS BIG PICTURE BECAUSE IF IF YOU WOULD ASK SOMEBODY ON THE STREET HEY. STATE TAX REVENUE FIFTY PRESS THE INCREASE IN MONEY GOING TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND NOW WE HAVE MORE. THAT ARE IN TROUBLE SO HOW DO YOU RECONCILE. THAT THAT ISSUE WHICH JUST COMPOUNDS. US AND PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT THIS WELL I THINK IT COULD FOR CONFOUNDS US A LITTLE BIT TOO WE ARE AT A POINT AFTER SIX YEARS OF A SIGNIFICANT REINVESTMENT. RAH RESTORATION OF THE CUTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE GREAT RECESSION PLUS ADDITIONAL -- BASICALLY GROWTH FUNDS AND AND THE QUESTION IS -- IF THINGS SLOW DOWN NOW GOING FORWARD WE EXPECT TO SEE THIS KIND OF TREND TWO YEARS FROM NOW -- MAYBE FOR A COUPLE DISTRICTS A YEAR FROM NOW ON THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE -- SO MANY AND FULL THAT ARE REALLY IN SOME EXTREME CONDITIONS IS -- IS ABSOLUTELY A GREAT QUESTION -- THEY ALL VERY SLIGHTLY IN IN THE REASONS FOR THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- IS ONE OF GREAT CONCERN NO IT'S BOTH IT'S A GREAT OBSERVATION IT IS A GREAT CONCERN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH -- SOME EASY FIXES IN IN SOME OF THESE CASES SO COMMON IN ALL OF THESE -- LIKELY IS SOME DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT -- ALTHOUGH SEX CITY SPECIFICALLY IS ABOUT A 1% THE CLIENTS BEEN RELATIVELY FLAT FOR THE LAST. FIVE SIX YEARS -- SO DECLINE ENROLLMENT -- CERTAINLY THE ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT IN THIS REGARD ABOUT -- PRESSURE POINTS FROM -- INCREASE PENSIONS SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS -- AND THOSE THINGS BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- WE WOULD WE WOULD TAKE A VIEW THAT SAYS -- ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE ELEVEN HUNDRED AND SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND THEY EACH HAVE A GOVERNING BOARD WHO HAS A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE DISTRICT IS LIVING WITHIN THE MEANS -- TO GET EARLIER ABOUT YOU KNOW THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME PRESSURE POINTS OF THAT THIS NARRATIVE OF COMING TO THE STATE FOR MORE. AND MORE AND WHILE I DON'T THINK ANY OF US COULD ARGUE THAT -- FUNDING OUR K. TWELVE IN K. FOURTEEN SYSTEM SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY THE REALITY IS THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. ON THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND SO WHY ARE THERE ON THESE DISTRICTS -- WHAT IS ALSO COMMON IN EACH OF THESE PROBLEM AREAS? IS SLOW TO RESPOND -- GOVERNANCE ISSUES. LEADERSHIP ISSUES SOME CASES TURN OVER A VERY SENIOR LEADERSHIP BULL SUPERINTENDENT BUSINESS OFFICE CAPACITY OF THE BUSINESS OFFICE IN MANY OF THESE CASES. ARM IN OUR EARTH IN TH OUR THREE NEGATIVES OTHER THAN I'M I'M FOR THE SAKE OF DISCUSSION WOULD. IGNORE FEATHER FALLS -- SACRAMENTO CITY SOUTHERN KERN. AND SWEET WATER THOSE ARE ALL -- LOW CAPACITY -- BUSINESS OFFICE FUNCTIONS ARE UP TO THIS POINT. IN THE CASE OF SWEET WATER THEY'VE HIRED A VERY -- HIGH CAPACITY PERSON TO LEAD THEIR BUSINESS FUNCTIONS -- BUT IN THE OTHER DISH GO WITH CAPACITY OF THAT LEADERSHIP SPECIFICALLY YEAH SO AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S HARD TO PREDICT. BUT IF WE SEE THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A INCREASE IN SCHOOL FUNDING FROM THE STATE THE LAST FIVE YEARS KIND LIKE THIS. IN THIS YEAR SOMEWHAT. YELLOWING SLOWING AND THEN LET'S SAVE IT SLOWS YOUR SLOWS EVEN MORE. DO YOU ANTICIPATE. A YEAR FROM NOW THAT THESE CHARTS AND BE. COMING OFF THE CHARTS. AND I I KNOW IT IS HARD TO PREDICT AND YOU GUYS YOU SAID SACRAMENTO WAS EVEN ON THE LIST. EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO. YEP ONE OF THE CERTAINLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO SACRAMENTO WAS ON THE LIST THEY HAD A VERY HEALTHY RESERVE AND CASH FORECAST -- BUT EVEN A YEAR AGO -- AFTER MULTIPLE WARNINGS IN SACKS CITY THEY WEREN'T ON THE LIST THIS PUTS ACT WHEN OKAY SAYING SO DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT AS WERE -- YES DIDN'T INVESTING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND NOT AS MUCH AS WE HAD BEEN THE PRIOR FOR YEARS. SO IT WE WOULD SAY WE WILL SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OTHER DISTRICTS ON THE THE ON THE NEGATIVE ARE QUALIFIED. THERE WILL BE CHORE PRESSURE POINTS AS REVENUE SLOWS AND EXPENSES DON'T SLOW IN CONCERT WITH THAT THAT SAME REVENUE SLOWING RIGHT. ARM THAT SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANT BACK TO STIRS ON PROVIDING SOME RELIEF THERE AT ONE OF THOSE PRESSURE POINTS AND SO ON AS NOTED IN MY COMMENTS UNDER SOLVENCY TRENDS WE ARE SEEN MULTI YEAR. FORECAST THAT SHOW DEFICIT TRANS MOST DEFINITELY THE MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE MULTI YOUR FINANCIAL PROJECTION THE AND SHOULDN'T AND AND SHOULDN'T BE DISCARDED -- BY GOVERNING BOARDS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IT SHOWS THEM UNDER CURRENT LAW AND CURRENT FORECAST WHERE THEY'RE HEADED. AND SO NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE THAT ACTION -- TAKING ACTION EARLY MEANS THAT THEY PREVENT THOSE. THOSE KINDS OF DISTRESS. AND PRESSURE POINTS -- IT IS. AGAIN I MUST SAY IT'S A FIDUCIARY THE RIVER BURE SPOTS ABILITY OF THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS. TO INSURE THAT THEY LIVE WITHIN THEIR MEANS -- AND THAT THEY SET THE PRIORITIES FOR THEIR DISTRICTS AS THEY MOVE FORWARD THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR THEIR FORECASTED REVENUE MEANS OR REPORTER RESERVE MEANS. AND THAT COURSE IS EXHIBIT A HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND AND BY THE WAY I I'M COUNTING ON OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO TO TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS AND AVOID GOING TO THE STATE TAKEOVER TAKING -- ACTIONS LITTLE LITTLE BY LITTLE CHIPPING AWAY. BUT IT'S YET TO BE SEEN BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY COUNTING ON AS YOU KNOW OUR ADVICE TO THEM HAS BEEN DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO AVOID -- COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR A EMERGENCY PREPARATION SO SO WITH SACRAMENTO. IT EAT IT THERE WAS A PRECIPITOUS DECLINE. AS YOU AS YOU KNOW JUST AND THEY WERE ON THE THE POSITIVE. LEISURE THE REMAIN ON THAT DATE YELLOWER READ. FAR AS YOUR ON THE CHART. HAVE WE SEEN THAT BEFORE OTHER DISTRICTS IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. GOING FROM POSITIVE TO QUALIFIED TO NEGATIVE YES SO ALSO ON THE NEGATIVE LISTA SWEETWATER THAT WAS AN OVERNIGHT -- ISSUE YEAH THAT WAS BROUGHT RIGHT -- I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT AS FRAUD -- WE MAY HAVE HAD -- SOME ACTIVITY THAT DIDN'T SURE -- BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THAT SOMEBODY WALKED OUT THE DOOR WITH YEAH FUNDS I WOULD ROSY THAT DEFINITION -- GROSS MISMANAGEMENT SACRAMENTO WASN'T WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE CASE YET BUT IT. DID WE EVER SEE A DISTRICT GO SO FAST. FROM GOOD NEWS -- TO TO TO NEGATIVE SO QUICKLY YES -- I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IN HISTORY THAT SHOW THAT WE WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE THEM MOVE FROM POSITIVE NAY GAVE THE AB TWELVE HUNDRED PROCESS IS. DESIGNED TO BE A PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM SO BABY STEPS TOWARDS THAT AND SO THERE'S A RELUCTANCE FIRM -- FOR EVERYBODY TO GO FROM A CERTIFICATION POSITIVE TO CERTIFICATION OF NEGATIVE OVERNIGHT IT'S MEANT TO KIND OF BUILD UP TO THAT AND THE INTERVENTION THAT COMES WITHOUT. IS MEANT TO BE A BABY STEPS MUCH LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH THE STUDENT IN A CLASSROOM THROUGH A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT -- WE PROVIDE JUST THE RIGHT INTERVENTION AT THE RIGHT TIME -- BUT YES -- SMALL DISTRICTS WITH A CHARTER THAT'S OPENING. WHAT WHAT LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE ON ON BEEN BEFORE YOU BEFORE IS VALLEJO CITY -- THEY HAD A DEFICIT -- IN THE CURRENT. IN THE CURRENT PERIOD -- THAT WAS FAIRLY MANAGEABLE -- THEY HAD A VERY LARGE. ARE A CHARTER SCHOOL OPEN WITH -- IF I RECALL RIGHT -- ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENT DECLINE -- AS OUR BUT IN THEDISTRICT AS A RESULT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL ON MORE THAN. MORE THAN DOUBLES THEIR DEFICIT ALMOST OVERNIGHT. AND SO THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE. OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT PARADISE MY LAST QUESTION WOULD BE IN A BIT EXTREME SITUATION RIGHT BUT WITH THE WITH THE FIRES -- BUT PARADISE IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT HALF OF ITS ENROLLMENT THAT IT HAD JUST IN OCTOBER -- FORECASTED GO DOWN ANOTHER THIRD IN OF THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR SO THEY'LL BE ON THIS LIST. IT DEPENDING ON THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION WITH RESPECT -- TO ASSISTANCE FOR THEM UNIQUELY BECAUSE OF THEIR THE NATURAL DISASTER -- THE THE FIRE MY LAST QUESTION -- WE HAVE FEW MEMBERS HERE WHEN I GOT A JOB IN. IS YOU WE HAVE. CHANGED THEIR THE RULES IN THESE DISTRESSED DISTRICTS OF COURSE YOU ALLUDED TO THAT NOW WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AS A AS A STRONGER ROLE IN WE HAVE THESE. IDENTIFYING POINTS BUT SON DISTRICTS DID SLEPT. OVERNIGHT ROUGH YOU KNOW TO THIS SO I GUESS -- MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. IS IT IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM ADEQUATE HER TO BE LOOKING AT AT THAT OTHER WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THESE EARLY WARNING SIGNS AND AND YOU KNOW KIND OF BLOW THE WHISTLE. AND AND MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON THEIR ELECTED LEADERSHIP AND THEIR SUPERINTENDENTS ARE AWARE AND MAKING THESE DECISIONS EARLIER SO WE DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW THESE CATASTROPHES IMPACTING OUR CLASSROOMS GAS IN A DAY WHO GETS HURT THE MOST. CLASSROOMS YOUR KIDS. STUDENTS ARE LEARNING WHICH IS YOU KNOW OUR TOP PRIORITY FOR A STATE SO. OUR IS THE CURRENT SYSTEMATIC WITH OR DO ANYTHING I THINK IT OTHER OTHER WAYS THE CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S PERFECT THERE ARE TWO WEEKS IT CAN BE MADE TO IT AND THAT'S IN PART WHY WE'VE SEEN SOME FORTY PIECES OF LEGISLATION SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN. AB TWELVE WONDER WAS PUT IN PLACE TO DO THIS FIND TWEAKS IN EACH OF THOSE DRIVEN BY EXPERIENCE ALONG THE WAY -- ARE THERE SOME TWEAKS AROUND -- THE REPORTING AND THE COUNTY'S ROLE WITH RESPECT -- TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS GREEN MEANT BUT THE REPORTING OF THE THE DATA AND THE COUNTIES ON THE TIME LINES RELATIVE TO THAT. STRENGTHENING THAT AREA -- I THINK PROBABLY WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE SYSTEM. AGAIN NOT INFRINGING UPON A LOCAL BOARD IN ITS IN ITS LABOR PARTNERS TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT -- I WOULD I WOULD DISCUSS WE ARE HARD PRESSED -- TO CRITICIZE ACTUALLY ANY OF THE LABOR AGREEMENTS THAT SOME FOLKS WOULD POINT TO AS THE CAUSE FOR SOME OF THESE BECAUSE THOSE MAY HAVE BEEN PERFECT AGREEMENTS FOR THAT DISTRICT. FOR ITS -- INSTRUCTIONAL MISSION -- IT'S TEACHERS WHICH ARE CRITICAL TO THAT MISSION -- HOWEVER THE DISTRICT AND DIDN'T RESPOND AFTER THAT TO THE CHANGES THAT THEY NEEDED TO MAKE CAN SO THE COUNTY SPECIFIC ROLE ON WITH REGARD TO THAT. A FOCUS ON ON THE COUNTIES EVALUATION OVER THE LIFE OF AN AGREEMENT AS OPPOSED TO TO ONLY FOCUSING ON THE CURRENT YEAR PLUS TWO YEARS. SO IF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT GOES OUT FOUR YEARS OR FIVE YEARS WHICH IS. PRETTY RARE THAT IT GOES OUT THAT FAR BUT IF IT DOES -- TO LOOK AT THE LIFE OF THE AGREEMENT THE CODE ALREADY PROVIDES FOR THAT BUT THAT'S NOT -- THAT IS NOT THE NORMAL PRACTICE IT'S EVERYTHING IN IN SCHOOL FINANCE FOCUSES ON CURRENT PLUS -- TO SYSTEM STRENGTHENING THEIR THOSE WOULD BE TO THE SYSTEM DOES WORK I THINK THE BEST EVIDENCE OF THAT. IS THAT WE IN TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT YEARS SINCE AB TWELVE HUNDRED WAS PASSED. WE'VE HAD. NINE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COME TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR EMERGENCY PREPARATION. WE HAVE ELEVEN HUNDRED PLUS ANOTHER HUNDRED AND TWELVE OR SO COMMUNITY COLLEGES SEVENTY SOME COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICTS -- THAT GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS EVERY YEAR RIGHT AND WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT JUST TRULY A HANDFUL THAT HAVE WERE THE PROPER OVERSIGHT THE PROPER INTERVENTION -- THAT THE DISTRICT ULTIMATELY WASN'T RESPONSIVE TO THAT OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA. THANK YOU AND IT. YOU KNOW I JUST I APPRECIATE THE CUT THE QUESTIONS THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I'M LOOKING AT TO USE THE CHART THAT AND WE'VE SEEN BEFORE. BUT THAT -- YOU KNOW THINKING OF THIRTY NINE THAT ARE QUALIFIED RIGHT NOW AND WHERE WE WERE PRIOR TO THE RECESSION AND KNOWING AND THEN THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR YEARS -- WE MAY FIND OURSELVES IN SOME DIFFICULTY I'M TRYING TO FOR PASSED ON WHAT. I MEAN HOW WECAN THINK ABOUT THIS THIRTY NINE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT COMPARED TO WHEN WE HAD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX BUT CERTAINLY WE DON'T WANT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX AT QUALIFIED -- IN SO CAN YOU JUST HELP US FORECAST A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR YEARS AND IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS -- UP ON TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T GET TO WHERE WE WERE IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE SO MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE SCHOOL BOARD AT THAT TIME OKAY RIGHT SO I WILL NOTE THAT PORTABLE PERFECT EXAMPLE RIGHT -- SO IF YOU YOU WERE REALLY TO PLOT OUT THIS THE ECONOMY IN THE STATE BUDGETS RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMY WITH RESPECT TO TAX INCOME -- INCOME FROM TAXES AND SO ON THE QUALIFIED IS AN EBB AND FLOW THAT ALMOST MATCHES EXACTLY -- GOOD BUDGET YEARS ABOUT BUDGET YEARS RIGHT THE PEAK OF ONE SEVENTY SIX WAS RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT RECESSION. IT WASN'T THE FIRST YEAR TOOK A FEW YEARS RIGHT IS DISTRICTS BEGAN TO SPEND DOWN THE RESERVES -- AND AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID CUTS TO PROGRAMS AND LAYOFFS -- TO OUR OUR PRECIOUS STAFF THAT THAT SERVER KIDS AND SO -- THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THAT PEAK ARE WE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT NO WHILE REVENUES MAY BE SLOWING AT THE STATE -- GOING FORWARD WE HAVE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF L. C. F. F. -- AND SO WERE IN THIS COAL ONLY FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY OF DESCRIBING IT ENVIRONMENT FOR YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE GROWTH ASIDE FROM ANY ADDITIONAL PREPARATIONS AT THE STATE. OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION MAY AGREE -- TO THERE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME PRESSURE POINTS COMING FORTH -- THE YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE GROWTH FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS -- WILL NOT MATCH THE YEAR OVER YEAR EXPENDITURE GROWTH IN -- IN FOUR AREAS THAT DISTRICTS OFTEN SAY THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER. PENSIONS AND SO MAYBE THAT THE PERSIAN FOOD PUMP ON TOGETHER STEP IN COLUMN WHICH IS A NATURAL PROGRESSION OBVIOUSLY OF AN EMPLOYEE -- BASED ON TIME IN EDUCATION -- IN THE DISTRICT AND BUT CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPECIAL ED -- REMEMBER THAT -- SPECIAL ED EXPENSES ARE INFLUENCED GREATLY NOT ONLY BY THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS BUT ALSO EVERY TIME THAT WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. SETTLEMENT THAT IS BASED ON AT LEAST AS THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BEEN BASED ON A COMBINATION OF COLA AND GAP FUNDING. SPECIAL ED DIDN'T RECEIVE THE GAP FUNDING RIGHT IT RECEIVED COLA. BUT NOT A SAID THE HAPPENINGS THAT IMMEDIATELY -- PUT SPECIAL ED EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES OUT OF SYNC THE OTHER ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE IS AS WE HAVE ABOUT 65% OF THE DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE DECLINING ENROLLMENT. SB SIX SO -- TO WHICH IS SPECIAL STATE MASTER PLAN SPECIAL ED FUNDING -- IS ALLOCATED BASED ON TOTAL AND BE DROPPING -- IN IN WIDE. SORRY IN WHITE AREAS ACROSS THE STATE -- A AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE ENROLLMENT SPECIAL IT IS INCREASING RIGHT -- THAT'S NOT THE THAT'S NOT THE SUBGROUP FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM THAT IS NOT OF IN TOTAL ENROLLMENT THAT'S DROPPING SO THOSE COULD DOES CREATE SOME CONFLICTS IN CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR -- IN HIS JANUARY PROPOSAL BEGINS TO LOOK AT SOME OF THAT -- AND SPEAK TO SOME OF THAT WITH RESPECT TO SOME SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SHORTLY -- SUBLIMINAL DONALD'S BOMB ON CHAIRED A COMMITTEE AND HAD A NUMBER PROPOSALS IN IN THE AREA OF SPECIAL ED -- IN IN THE PAST -- EIGHTEEN MONTHS TWO YEARS REALLY -- AND SO. THOSE ARE ALL GOING TO BE PRESSURE POINTS THOSE WILL ALL INCREASE PROBLY. AT INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS -- THOSE EXPENDITURE AREAS WILL INCREASE AT A HIGHER RATE THAN WHAT THE REVENUES GOING TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS THAT'S WHAT THIS. THAT'S WHAT THESE DEFICIT TRENDING MODELS ARE SHOWING US ON A DISTRICT BY DISTRICT. MOST DISTRICTS THEN WILL STEP UP AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN THEIR PRIORITIES AND THEIR EXPENDITURES -- TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE AND THEY WILL HAVE BALLOTS BUDGETS -- A FEW DISTRICTS WON'T DO THAT THEY'LL END UP INFLUENCING WHATEVER THE COUNTY IS HERE WE HOPE FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- BUT CERTAINLY MAY BE LONGER PERIOD THAT IS WHY ONE OF THE TRIGGERS WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR PROACTIVE WORK. WAS THREE CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED. IF YOU'RE SETTING IN THAT QUALIFIED AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING OFF THAT LIST IMPACT THE POSITIVE AFTER THREE WHICH IS ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF FIRST SECOND FOLLOWING FIRST ENRON OR SECOND FIRST SECOND. INTERIM -- SO YEAR YEAR AND A HALF THE TIME IF YOU'RE NOT MOVING BACK IN THAT TIME PERIOD THEN WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE DISTRICT AS PART OF THAT EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. AS A SUPPLEMENT TO WHAT ARE COUNTY OFFICES ARE ALREADY DOING THANK. OKAY MISTER DON. JUST A FOLLOW UP MAYBE RELATED TO THE THE SACRAMENTO SITUATION. AND WE HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT EXCUSE ME. QUINCY NO. HERE WE GO ALL RIGHT I WITH REGARD TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND CLOSING SCHOOL FACILITIES -- YOURS LIBERAL POLITICAL VENTURE THERE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I'M SURE THAT'S THE BIGGEST HURDLE. TO CLOSING SCHOOLS BUT IS THERE. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HAVE DISTRICTS TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. AT CLOSING THOSE SCHOOL FACILITIES THEY REALLY NEED TO CLOSE BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL IMPACT THEY MAY HAVE. WELL DIFFICULT DIFFICULT TOPIC DIFFICULT QUESTION IS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER OF THE LAST YOU WANT TO DO IS CLOSE A NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL CRISIS -- SO LET'S BEGIN OUTLETS FOR THE RECORD I'M NOT ADVOCATE OKAY I WAS GOING TO CLOSE I WAS CERTAIN OF THAT BUT LET'S LET'S HAVE SOME CLARITY THOUGH. FOR SAKS CITY THEIR ENROLLMENT DECLINE IS A VERY VERY MINOR IT'S IN THE 1% -- SO THAT'S NOT. FAIR THAT IS THERE AT JUST OVER FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN A PROJECT TO BUILD THEIR MOST RECENT HISTORY HAS BEEN ROUGHLY YES I'M AWARE OF A NEW PROJECTION JUST IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO THAT. THAT -- THAT THAT NUMBER IS HIGHER -- CERTAINLY AWARE OF THAT FOR NEXT YEAR BUT CERTAINLY THEIR ACTUAL IS WHEN WE COMPARE YEAR TO YEAR. FOR THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS LEADING UP TO THIS YEAR IT'S BEEN JUST IT'S BEEN. ONE YEAR WAS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN 1% BUT ON AVERAGE BEEN ABOUT 1% -- SO A BETTER EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE INGLEWOOD IN OAKLAND. ARM INGLEWOOD IS DROPPED FROM SERVING ROUGHLY NINETEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS TO LESS THAN. EIGHT THOUSAND THEY HAVE SURPLUS SEATS SURPLUS CLASSROOMS SURPLUS SCHOOLS -- IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THEY WERE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THAT. A LOCAL PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT. IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THEY HAVE TAKEN. AFTER YEARS OF CONVERSATION -- IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THEY'VE PUT TOGETHER A VERY VIABLE PLAN. ON TO ADDRESS THAT -- SOME VOIGTS I'M SOME RE USE OF SITES DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF SITES AND SO ON AND CERTAINLY ALSO THE SELL OR LEASE OF SOME SITES. IN OAKLAND'S CASE -- AS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE PANEL BEFORE ME ON THE DISTRICT HAS COME UP WITH A DRAFT PLAN THEY CALL THE CITY PLAN -- TO LOOK AT TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL SITES HAVE TAKEN ACTION I BELIEVE TO DATE ON ONE OF THOSE -- THEY'VE NOT ADOPTED THE WHOLE PLAN UNLESS IT'S BEEN DONE IN THE LAST WEEK AND I'M JUST NOT CAUGHT UP TO IT -- BUT THEY'VE TAKEN ACTION ON ONE SITE WITHIN THAT GROUP OF TWENTY FOUR AGAIN THEY'RE UNDER -- EIGHTEEN FORTY GUIDELINES IN ORDER TO TO RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL STATE ASSISTANCE EIGHTEEN FORTY WOULD PROVIDE HAVE CERTAIN BENCHMARKS THEY NEED TO MEET -- RIGHT SIZING THE DISTRICT'S FACILITIES IS ONE OF THOSE BENCHMARKS -- AS YOUR I THINK WHILE WEARING OAKLAND'S CASE THEY HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF OPERATING RELATIVELY SMALL VERY SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD CAMPUSES TO START WITH. THERE ARE GONNA BE TO SCALE ISSUES WITH THAT FROM A QUALITY STANDPOINT THOSE THOSE MAY BE. GOOD THINGS FOR KIDS BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY EXTREME ECONOMIES OF SCALE ISSUES THERE WHEN YOU'RE OPERATING TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED STUDENT CAMPUSES AS COMPARED. TO ELEMENTARY CAMPUSES COMPARED TO A LITTLE BIT MORE ON ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW WHICH IS. SOMEWHERE IN THE FIVE HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED RANGE ACROSS THE STATE TOOK TOOK ONE LAST QUESTION. KITA DISTRICTS -- FISCAL STABILITY IS OF THEIR CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIAL. OR THEIR ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF A BUSINESS SERVICES. WHAT IS THE SELLING Y. OF THOSE LOOKING LIKE AROUND? IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE SAW DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WE SAW A NUMBER OF VERY EXPERIENCED FOLKS LEAVE -- MAINLY DUE TO RETIREMENT BUT PROBABLY SOME PROBABLY SAID KHAN HAD ENOUGH OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO MAKE ALL THESE PUZZLE PIECES FIT TOGETHER RIGHT -- FIGMENT ITSELF OPERATES THE LEADING -- CBO PREPARATION PROGRAM -- WE JUST GRADUATED TWO WEEKS AGO THE NEXT CLASS OF TWENTY SIX FOLKS -- CURRENTLY PROBABLY A THIRD OF THE CBO'S AROUND THE STATE HAVE GONE THROUGH OUR PREPARATION PROGRAM YOUR LONG PREPARATION PROGRAM HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- WE STAFF THE U. S. C. PROGRAM THAT DOES SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR. AND WE SUPPORT WITH -- STAFF THE BUSINESS OFFICIAL PREPARATION PROGRAM I'M BETWEEN THOSE THREE PROGRAM THAT'S THE MAJORITY OF NEW FOLKS COMING INTO THEIR SEATS AND RAN BY AND FAR THEY'RE PREPARED. TO TO BE IN OF SEATS -- IT'S A MIXED BAG BEYOND THAT -- GOT IT. AND JUST A MISTER DONALD. ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO THE TAXI DISTRICT CLOSED I THINK. EIGHT TO TEN SCHOOLS. SO THEY'VE THEY'VE DONE THAT A PLANET YEAH -- MISTER ICE FISHING. THANK YOU A MUST SHARE MISTER FINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A PRESENTATION I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE. TO YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU KNOW WILD SO MUCH ATTENTION IS BEING FOCUSED ON THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE -- REALLY STRUGGLING THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MAKING THE HARD DECISIONS BEING RESPONSIBLE TO LIVE WITHIN THEIR MEANS -- AND AND AND TO ME YOU KNOW. I MEAN I I I I I WISH THAT THE THE BUDGET SHARE WAS STILL HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO PUSH BACK ON ON NOW -- ONE OF HIS COMMENTS AND PERHAPS HE'S HIM AMOROUS STAFF IS LISTENING. TO THE ON ON THE TV BUT IT ON ME HE MADE THE COMMENT THAT THAT IT -- IT'S A IT'S A POLITICAL PLOY TO BE -- YOU KNOW THE TURN TO THE STATE FOR MORE FUNDING. BUT TO ME IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT HAVE IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE THAT THE DISTRICT RATES OF THE PENSION COSTS. ARE MORE THAN DOUBLE OF WHAT IT WAS IN -- TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FORTY YES YES ROUGHLY EIGHT POINT TWO FIVE IS THE HISTORICAL STIRS RATE IN WHERE ABOVE SIXTEEN RIGHT NOW SO THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN DOUBLE AND WE'RE GOING TO EIGHTEEN AND WITH SOME ASSISTANCE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET AND THEN STIRS. STIRS HAS A FORECAST THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US BACK -- AFTER HITTING IN THE NINETEEN BRINGS US BACK INTO THE EIGHT LOW EIGHTEENS -- I FORGOT THE YEAR TWENTY FIRST YEAR THINGS TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OF THEM FIVE ELCO. BUT BUT ROUGHLY DOUBLING -- WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD TIME AND THEN YOU YOU MADE THE COMMENT THAT. THAT IS ONLY PROJECTED THAT THE THE THE HIGH NEED SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS ESPECIALLY ARE ARE PROJECTED TO BE. CONTINUE -- TO TO TO INCREASE. AND WAIT WE ALSO HAVE THE SITUATION. OF A IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF LCF WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT GETTING BACK TO WHERE WE WERE. IN -- SEVEN OH AID SO. IT'S A CORRECT. ROUGHLY SPEAKING DEPEND ON PERSPECTIVE YES. THE THE THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL WAS TO GET BACK TO PRE RECESSION LEVELS AN N. -- EDUCATION FUNDING IN IRAQ DURING GROWTH IN FACT WAS WORTH YES. SO. I MEAN HOW MUCH OF ALL OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND HAPPENING HERE NOT JUST TO THOSE WITH NEGATIVE AND QUALIFY CERTIFICATIONS. BUT WITH ALL THE DISTRICTS STRUGGLING IS THE FACT THAT WERE THEY ALL DISTRICTS ARE BEING ASKED YOU KNOW TO TO COVER SO MUCH MORE IN TERMS OF THESE. THESE RISING FIX COSTS WITH. YOU KNOW WELL OF FUNDING THAT -- WHICH IS LIT WITH WAS BASICALLY GETTING THE GOAL WAS TO GET US BACK TO WHERE WE WERE -- BEFORE THE RECESSION. WELL THIS IS NOT IT. THIS IS NOT AN EASY EQUATION -- UNDERSTAND THAT FOR SOME DISTRICTS AND ROMAN IS PLAYING A ROLE FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF DISTRICTS -- THEIR ABILITY TO I'M A FASHION TO REDUCTIONS IN ENROLLMENT -- DECLINING ENROLLMENT YEAH WHETHER SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM CERTAINLY HAS -- A VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THEM THEY'VE GOT TO BE RESPONSIVE STATE LAW PROVIDES FOR THAT YEAR OF DELAY THAT -- WE OFTEN REFER TO IT AS THE SOFT LANDING -- WHERE YOU GET THE CHOICE OF USING THE GREATER OF THE CURRENT YEAR THE PRIOR YEARS -- AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE WHICH IS THE THE CASE LOAD FACTOR IN THE REVENUE. RIGHT -- MANY DISTRICTS ARE ALSO TURNING TO THEIR LOCAL -- CONSTITUENTS THEIR TAXPAYERS FOR ASSISTANCE WHETHER THAT'S YOUR PARCEL TAX OR MORE COMMENT ON THE FACILITY SIDE THROUGH GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND BUT MANY MANY -- MORE MORE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE STATE THAN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE -- LOOK TO PARCEL TAXES TO FUND VERY SPECIFIC THINGS LIKE LOWER CLASS SIZES AND BROADER CURRICULUM OFFERINGS INCLUDING MUSIC ART -- SUPPORTING OTHER -- HIGH PRIORITIES IN THEIR DISTRICT SO. IT IT IS NOT A IT'S COMPLICATED IT'S A COMPLICATED AND HAND I DON'T. THE EACH COMMUNITIES IN EACH DISTRICTS JUST A TAD DIFFERENT IN ITS CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT BUT HOW MUCH OF THIS OVERALL IS A REFLECTION YOU KNOW -- WE WE WE'VE BEEN HAVING ITS ONGOING DEBATES ABOUT -- HOW MUCH CALIFORNIA COMPARES TO THE REST OF THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE SPENDING? ACCORDING TO EDUCATION WEEKLY IF WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COST OF LIVING OR FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION -- LA L. -- YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WHAT IS PRESENT LAST WEEK PRESENTED TO ADD TO THE THE THE THE OVERALL ADVOCACY OF OF K. THROUGH TWELVE FUNDING I MEAN WE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW OR LOSE SOME OF US ARE PATTING US ON OURSELVES ON MY BACK IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE'VE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AND AND AND THE LAST SIX SEVEN YEARS. BUT IT IF IN A FOR STILL TALKING ABOUT THE OVERALL -- FUNDING BEING AN ADEQUATE TO MEET THE THE REAL COSTS THAT ARE DISTRICTS ARE FACING THEN AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS IS THE BOTTOM LINE -- REALITY THAT ARE DISTRICTS ARE FACING. SO. SIR I I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THAT'S A QUESTION OF THE LA -- AND AND MOST LIKELY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW OUR ROLE IS TO ASSIST TO DISTRICT -- UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT'S REVENUES ARE AND LIVING WITHIN THE LIVING WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THAT REPRESENTS -- AS OPPOSED TO SAYING WE HOPE -- FOR AND YOU CAN BUILD A PLAN AROUND THE HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE -- ADDITIONAL -- DOLLARS IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER AND SO -- THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE THAT WE WOULD TAKE IS WORKING WITH A DISTRICT GETS LEADERSHIP ITS GOVERNING BOARD -- TO LIVE WITHIN THE MEANS OF YOU WE COULD GO BACK TEN YEARS WE COULD GO BACK TWENTY YEARS AND SAY THERE WERE OTHER PRESSURE POINTS BACK THEN. RIGHT -- AND IT WOULD JUST BE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LIST -- BUT THERE WERE PRESSURE POINTS IN DISTRICTS THE MAJORITY OF DISTRICTS AGAIN -- TOOK THE ACTION THEY NEEDED -- TO TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS FOR THEIR KIDS BUT WITHIN. THE CONFINES OF THEIR REVENUES OKAY BUT WHAT MY LAST QUESTION THEN IS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS THE THICK MAT DIRECTOR I I I BELIEVE YOU'VE SAID THIS IN. SO MANY WAYS -- EARLIER BUT IN A WAIT WE'VE HAD THE LONGEST RUN -- ECONOMIC RUN -- WHERE WE'RE? OVERDUE FOR A ECONOMIC DOWNTURN -- IT IS YOU KNOW MOST LIKELY THAT WE WILL SEE ANOTHER SPIKE AND THE A NUMBER OF NEGATIVE AND QUALIFY CERTIFICATIONS WITH ECONOMIC DOWNTURN QUALIFIED FOR SURE NEGATIVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT CHART -- NEGATIVE -- ARE -- WHEN I DISTRICTS IN NEGATIVE THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THERE -- THAT ISN'T RIGHT. AND SO -- BUT CERTAINLY FOR QUALIFIED YES IT FOR IT FOLLOWS THE EVAN FLOW OF OF THE OF THE BUDGET IN THE ECONOMY. OKAY THANK YOU YES. THANK YOU I I DO THINK YOU'RE RIGHT YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT THOUGH BRING US BACK TO OUR PRE RECESSION LEVELS THAT A BE INTERESTED MAYBE THE LA OR SOMEONE COULD HELP US UNDERSTAND. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT PER IS INCREASE WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE AS YOUR JOB IS TO DEAL WITH DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN TROUBLE RIGHT NOW AND OUR WORLD WE'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR DISTRICTS. CALLING YEAR CALLING YOUR OFFICE AND SO. TAKE THAT OUT EVEN POTENTIALLY LOOK AT HOW THE SPECIAL THAT INCREASES AND KIND OF GET A HANDLE AS FAR AS THE OVERALL FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE REALITY IS WE DO HAVE THESE THESE -- INCREASES IN PRESENCE THERE SO THAT'S A DISTRICTS HAVE TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. WE WILL WE WILL -- SEE YOU -- HE SAID. YES AND WITH THAT WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH PUBLIC COMMENT. PLEASE LINE UP IN THE MIDDLE. GOOD MORNING SERRA BUDGETS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS HERE TO TESTIFY ON ITEM ONE AND THREE SUPPORTING THE GOVERNOR'S -- COMMITMENT TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AS WELL AS THE RECOGNITION OF OUR PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AND COSTS THAT ARE ENCROACHING ON ALL OUR OTHER EDUCATIONAL SERVICES THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CATHERINE OCCUR GONNA ON BEHALF OF CAPT COPYING CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER -- MAKE COMMENTS ARE ON ISSUE THREE THE ACCOUNTABILITY UPDATE AND THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. ARE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THIS COMMITTEE CONSIDER PROVIDING FIVE MILLION TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS THE STATE LEAD. THIS IS THE ONLY LEAD AGENCY OF ALL OF THE ENTITIES BUILT INTO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THAT DOES NOT HAVE FUNDS TO CONDUCT THEIR WORD THEIR WORK REGIONALLY OUR STATE WHITE. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE DEFINITION FOR THE ENGLISH LEARNER ACADEMIC INDICATORS BE REVISED AND DISAGREED IT BY ENGLISH LEARNER ONLY AND RE CLASSIFIED ENGLISH LEARNERS. SEVERAL ANALYSES HAVE INDICATED THAT AGGRAVATING THE SCORES MASKS THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT ENGLISH LEARNERS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND THAT THIS HAS DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVING TECHNICAL SUPPORT UNDER THE LCS FAST AND THAT YES AS THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SHERRY MEMBERS DEREK LENNIX ON BEHALF THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA TO THE BIG ISSUES RAISED BY YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS TODAY AROUND DISTRICTS OFTEN SEEN GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE -- ON ISSUE NUMBER TWO AROUND PENSIONS I THINK ARE THE BEAUTY OF THIS PROPOSAL MY WE SUPPORTED SO STRONGLY IS THAT IT DOES ALLOW DISTRICTS IN A FUNCTIONAL SENSE TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. YES IT'S GENERAL FUND NO IT'S NOT ON GOING NINETY EIGHT MONEY BUT FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES DISTRICTS ARE EXPERIENCING AT THE SAME WAY AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK IT'S SUCH A SMART MOVE FOR THE GOVERNMENT LEGISLATORS. TO SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR STAFF -- JEFF BARKER REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS -- WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH A LETTER BECAUSE YOU'VE COVERED UP ALL COVERED A LOT OF GROUND TODAY. I WOULD I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH A COUPLE OF QUICK THOUGHTS. ONE IS THAT EARLY ON IN THE HEARING YOU HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LOW PERFORMING STUDENT BLOCK GRANT. AND WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WANT TO IMPROVE. THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE MOST OF STE. PERFORMING AT THE LOWEST LEVELS WE WOULD ENCOURAGE -- THE COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO BEFORE IT MAKES ANY DECISIONS ABOUT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM. TO REALLY WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE DATA DEMONSTRATE -- WE'RE CONCERNED THAT AS WELL MEANING AS THAT MIGHT BE AND WE DO BELIEVE IT TO BE COMPLETELY WHILE MEANING. THAT CARVING OUT WHAT ESSENTIALLY IS A CATEGORICAL PROGRAM WITH AN L. C. F. F. IS NOT THE OUTE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GO. AND THEN -- WITH REGARD TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT -- AND IT'S HARD AFTER HEARING LIKE THIS NOT TO STAND AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND LOOK INTO THE A BEST BUT THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD WORK GOING ON IN MANY IN ALL COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE IN ALL REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE. COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION COLLABORATING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DO SOME OF THE KIND OF WORK THAT MR ARE MOLINO WAS TALKING ABOUT IDENTIFYING ROOT CAUSES. WE'RE ALL VERY IMPATIENT TO SEE IT'S BUT THAT WORK TAKES TIME. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND STAFF CALENDAR HOWEVER THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT CENTER AND I'M HERE ON ITEM THREE I'M SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS AROUND THE NEW CHARTER SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS ON EL CAP. AS YOU KNOW THAT -- BY DESIGN CHARTER SCHOOLS ACTUALLY BEGIN WITH MORE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS. WITH THE PUBLIC HEARINGS ON THEIR ACTUAL CHARTERS WHICH ARE SIXTEEN POINT DOCUMENTS AND THE FRAMEWORK FOR CHARTERS IS ALREADY SET AND INFLEXIBLE. SO ADDING ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEARINGS AND REQUIREMENTS AROUND AN EIGHT POINT EL CAP -- SORT OF CONFLICTS WITH -- WITH THE CHARTER ITSELF AND COULD LEAD TO CHARTER REVOCATION WITHOUT THE RIGHT OF APPEAL SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE ALSO THINK THAT CHARTER SCHOOL PARENTS TEND TO BE MUCH MORE INVOLVED AS A GENERAL RULE. AND COULD VOTE WITH THEIR FEET -- AND LEAVE THE SCHOOL IF THE SCHOOL IS IT MEETING THEIR EXPECTATIONS. LASTLY WITH A NEW LANGUAGE CHARTER OFF THE RISERS NEED TO REVIEW AND READ TO DOCUMENTS IT'S AN UNNECESSARY BURGER BURDEN ON A CHARTER AUTHORIZED -- AND THE CHARTER DOCUMENT ALONE SHOULD BE CLEAR ENOUGH ON ITS MISSION AND GOALS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MARK THE ON BUTTON BEFORE THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ACCESS SUPPORTIVE OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR LC. ALSO THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS FROM GENERAL FUND FOR THE PERSONS OF FOR THE STARS -- CONTRIBUTION I'M OUT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE ECHO THE COMMENTS BY MR BACA FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFIE OF IT WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE STATE'S WORK AROUND SYSTEM OF SUPPORT AND HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS. ARE TO BETTER BE ABLE TO IN IMPROVE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT OVER TIME I WE HAVE EMBRACE THAT CONTAINS IMPROVE MY PHILOSOPHY THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT WILL TAKE TIME TO RUN A REFER TO IS ALSO CHIEF MEN GAPS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE.

HOWEVER WE CONTINUE TO URGE THE LEGISLATURE AS WAS POINTED BY A BY THE CHAIR AND OTHERS I TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN L. CFF INFLEXIBLE FUNDING. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE SPEAKERS THIS MORNING THERE'S A LOT OF GROWING COST FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WHAT WE NEED IS MORE FLEXIBLE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT STUDENT NEEDS. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GI SO PROCESS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON NIGHT NUMBER. TWO ON YOUR ANALYSIS THAT'S BEEN RAISED WE THINK THE CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES UNDER THE PO'S SYSTEM WITH BUT LEFT OUT. WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE ADMINISTRATION I HAVE MET. WITH THE THE ADMINISTRATION DIRECTLY ON THIS -- THE AMOUNT -- FOR THE SAME PARITY TREATMENT FOR CLASSIFIED THAT YOU HAVE WITH TEACHERS AND WE SUPPORTED THREE BILLION FOR TEACHERS. IT WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOUR TO BUY DOWN THE EMPLOYER RATE FOR A YEAR. EVERYTHING IS A REASONABLE AMOUNT TO TREAT CLASSIFIES HIM PLEASE THREE QUICK POINTS OUT RATES ARE GOING UP JUST. AS HIGH AS TEACHERS ON THE BASE LC PERCENT OF ESTABLISHED BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THAT SAYS THAT WHEN RATES DROP THE STATE CAN PULL MONEY BACK OUT OF THE REVENUE LIMITS SYSTEM UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM. BUT WHEN RATES ARE SUPPOSED TO GO UP THAT'S OPPOSE IT BACK FEEL BECAUSE DISTRICT NOW FACING RISING PENSION COSTS WERE NOW NO ONE THOUGHT IT WOULD GO ABOVE THIRTEEN POINT OR TWO NOW WE'RE GOING PAST FIFTEEN AND GOING THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THESE KINDS OF PRESSURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ONE FINAL POINT IF YOU DON'T DO THIS FOR CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE ALSO THERE WILL BE A RELUCTANCE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. EVERY EMPLOYEE YOU HIRE WILL BE AN ADDED COST FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT AND I PENSION ISSUE THANK YOU.
