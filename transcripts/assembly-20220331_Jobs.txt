MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE GONE FOR MAKING UNDER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND TO WELL OVER SIXTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. FURTHERMORE THE TECHNOLOGY CONSULTING SIDE OF OUR BUSINESS HAS HIRED MANY OF THESE STUDENTS TO HELP CITIES BUILD. AND STRENGTHEN THEIR DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE. PROVING IT IS POSSIBLE TO BUILD STELLAR TECHNOLOGY WITH DIVERSE. NONTRADITIONAL TALENT. ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY LOST ONE POINT SIX MILLION JOBS. BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. THE HIRING HAS SINCE REBOUNDED THE NATURE OF WORK AND THE SKILLS EMPLOYERS SEEK HAVE CHANGED PERMANENTLY. IN ADDITION THE HARDEST HIT WORKERS INCLUDING LATINOS WOMEN AND WORKERS UNDER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. CONTINUE TO FACE STEEP BARRIERS TO CONNECTING WITH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. THESE COMMUNITIES NEED A HOLISTIC TOOL TO CONNECT THEM WITH TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES THAT LEAD DIRECTLY TO JOBS EMPLOYERS HIRING LOCALLY. AND SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS CHILD CARE. AB TWENTY TWO HUNDRED WOULD ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS FUNDING ACCESSIBLE EASY TO NAVIGATE ONLINE TOOLS AND PLATFORMS.

MISTER MOORE AND ARE YOU WITH US YOU EVEN WHEN MY NAME IS GABRIELA AND MONICA I CONSERVATIVE POLICY ANALYST AT THE UCLA LATINO POLICY AND POLITICS INITIATIVE WHICH IS A MULTI ISSUE POLICY THINK TANK FOCUSED ON BUILDING DEMOCRATIC INCLUSION AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY CORONATION ST BERKELEY GROWING LATINO COMMUNITY- THANK YOU ALL FOR ACCORDINGLY THE PRIVILEGE OF TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF. LOT STABLE. TO MONTH- IF YOU'LL STAY THAT I COULD TO THEM FOR THE OF THE WITHIN THE CURRENT STATE OF NOT ENOUGH IN THE U. S. WORK FOR. AND THE NEED FOR THREE WIDE TO UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL. REALLY IT'S ALL AN ADDRESS THE VERY OF OUR MARCH. THAT WE CAN AND THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THE SAMELEVEL OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. EARLY IN THE SECOND AND I CALIFORNIA LOST THREE MILLION JOBS. LATINO AND BLACK RESIDENTS AT 22% IN 26% JOB WALK RATES RESPECTIVELY ALEXINA NATIONALLY. REALLY TOOK THE BRUNT OF IT. FOR THE DEMOCRATS OF NOT BEING UP IN THE S. LABOR. FOR TO GROW BY FIVE POINT EIGHT ACT. BUT TODAY WE HAVE SEPARATE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF JOB LOSSES. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND DEPARTURES FROM THE WORK FORCE ALL TOGETHER. UNDERSTANDING THE BARRIERS TO PUT NOTHING NOTHING FINANCIAL PRECARITY I MADE THEM VULNERABLE TO THE ECONOMIC SHUTDOWN IT'S CRUCIAL TO ADDRESSING THE OBSTACLE PREVENTING MILLIONS FROM REALIZING AND SATISFYING THEIR ECONOMIC NEEDS. ALTERNATELY IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF IMPROVING WAGES. BUT IMPROVING ACCESS. TO WRITING SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY. AND DEMOCRATS ENOUGH MAKES DOLLAR AN HOUR TWO FIVE LESS THAN THE US AVERAGE WORKER THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE F. HIGH PERFECT REPEATED AND LOW PAYING SECTORS LIKELY SURE HOSPITALITY. INDUSTRY THAT WALK ALMOST HALF OF ITS JOB IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS AT THAT. OUR AND I WANT TO AND- WITH. THIS IS OUR CLEAR THE CALL MY MOMENT FOUR IN TEN LATINO INTO. ALONE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION WORKERS ARE EMPLOYED IN OVER REPRESENTED IN LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY BUT ALSO CONSTRUCTION AGRICULTURE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL TRADE INDUSTRIES. WHICH ARE THE LOWEST RATE THE DIGITIZATION I WILL LIKELY SUPPORT SIMILAR JOB LOSSES. BUT THIS TIME DUE TO AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE COMING DECADE. ECONOMIC PRESSURES OF JOB INSECURITY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ALSO ON BOB DROP BOB THIS IS JOB CREATION. AT SIX POINT 5% MEDINA FOR SELF EMPLOYED AT AT LESS THAN HALF OF THE RATE OF THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS AND THE GAP CONTINUES TO GROW. UP YEAH NOW OFFICIAL EFFECT IN 202140% OF SELF EMPLOYED BUT- STILL LIVED IN OR SUPPORTED A HOUSEHOLD. THAT HAS LOST INCOME DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WHICH HAD DOWNSTREAM AFFECTING THEIR ABILITY TO RUN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AND FOSTER MUCH NEEDED JOB CREATION BUT ALSO MEET THE MOST BASIC HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES. THIS IS WHY AB TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PAIRED WITH CRUCIAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN HELPING TO STRENGTHEN OUR WORKFORCE. IN FUNDING THE CREATION OF ALL MY RESOURCES. IF THAT WOULD NOT ONLY HELP FACILITATE JOB PROSPECTS FOR THOSE UNEMPLOYED BUT ALSO PROVIDE INVALUABLE TRAINING TO UPSKILL AND RESKILL. ALL WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO A MORE RESILIENT AND BETTER PAID EMPLOYMENT UP BETTER PLEASE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT HOW CALIFORNIA COLLECTIVELY. RIGHT THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE KNOWN AND YOU AT THIS TIME. LET ME TURN TO- THE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DICE IF THERE'S ANY MEMBERS WHO WISH TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. WE HAVE A MOTION IS- SECOND WE HAVE A SECOND MOTION BY. SARAMA SUSPECTED BY DOCTOR CHOI ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS HI GOOD MORNING I'M STILL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY WELL ESTABLISHED JOB SEARCH SITES. ONLINE TODAY I'M I'M NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT. YOU VIEW TO BE SORT OF THE UNMET NEED IN THE CURRENT ECOSYSTEM AS IT WERE- AND THEN HOW SPECIFICALLY YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO FILL THAT- AND PARTICULARLY HOW YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO I IN A WORLD WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S PLENTY OF NAME BRAND JOB SEARCH SITES HOW WOULD FOLKS THAT ARE. CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM THAT. HOW WOULD YOU BUBBLE TO THE TOP IN TERMS OF THEIR JOB SEARCH SO IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO IT TO SOME OF THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME- I WILL SPEAK TO THE GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE ARE ESTABLISHING WITH THE BILL I WILL DIRECT THE WORK FORCE GAPS QUESTION TO GABRIELA CARMONA IF I CAN AND I WILL HAVE. KRISTIN SPEAK ABOUT ONWARD CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SUCCESSFULLY. THE POINT HERE IS REALLY TO CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM FOR THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP MANY OF THESE UNDER RESOURCED. COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE HISTORICAL GAPS. WILL TO HAVE THE- TRAINING AND SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY. BRIDGE THOSE GAPS IN THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THIS GRANT PROGRAM- SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN ONWARD CALIFORNIA WILL HELP US TO DO THAT. BUT I'D LIKE TO DIRECT THE WORKFORCE GAPS QUESTION TO MISS CARMONA IF I CAN. YES PERFECT DOT COM SO I THINK JUST TO REITERATE SOMEONE OF BLACK WITH PART OF MY TESTIMONY BUT I THINK THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE A MUCH MORE DILIGENT AND FOCUSED. ON STRENGTHENING TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO UPSKILLING AND RESKILLING LET THE NOTHING SPECIFICALLY LIKE THE NOTHING OUR LABOR MARKET WE KNOW THAT THEY JUST HAPPEN DISPROPORTIONATELY BARRED FROM ACCESSING HIGHER WAGE EMPLOYMENT- AND ESPECIALLY WAY IMMINENT THREAT REALLY I DO AUTOMATION OF LOW WAGE WORK SO I THINK REALLY JUST TAX CAN'T CLOSE OUT AND JUST REALLY- YOU THINK. OF THAT EITHER. WHAT WE SHOW THEM THAT. OVER IN THE- ON INDUSTRY THAT WE KNOW ARE HIGH. CORRECT THE MISSION I THE AFRICAN. WE AND HOW. WHOLESALE AND RETAIL TRADE ON THOSE FOR INDUSTRIES EMPLOY ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION FOLKS I'M NOT 40% OF WHICH ARE LIKE YOU KNOW WORKERS. OR 40% OF LATINO WORKERS WORK WITHIN YOU TO TREAT INDUSTRY SO THERE IS A REAL IMMINENT NEED ON TEN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES. AS WELL AS- FACILITATING A PATHWAY TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THESE LOW WAGE SECTORS- ARE. ME SHE'S THAT INTO- HIGHER INCOME DROPPED. I WILL NOW HAVE IT'S OKAY MADAM. MISSPELLED SPEAK TO ON WORD CALIFORNIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS HAS WORKED ALREADY. THANK YOU DR A BILL THAT. I CAN JUST QUICKLY SAY THAT WITH THE LAUNCH OF ON GRID CALIFORNIA AT THE BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC AT WHAT SET THE TOOL APART. IS THAT IT WAS NOT JUST ONE JOB PLATFORM WHICH IS DEEPLY IMPORTANT BUT- NUMBER ONE IS INTEGRATED WITH SO MANY OF THE STATE RESOURCES ALREADY AVAILABLE AND SO EVERYTHING IS HOUSED UNDER ONE UNIT SO NOT JUST. JOB OPPORTUNITIES BUT TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND ESSENTIAL LIVE SERVICES THINGS LIKE CRITICAL AS A CHILD CARE AND YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S FOOD AND SECURITY ISSUES. SO THEY ARE NOT NEEDING TO GO TO ONE PLATFORM THEY'RE NOT A MEETING TO GO TO MULTIPLE PLATFORMS. WELL TO PULL ME IN. AND I THINK ON THE OUTREACH COMPONENT THAT'S ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ACTUALLY. DOUBLE DOWN ON IN THE WAY WE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO AT THE BEGINNING. OF ON WERE CALIFORNIA DAYS WHERE WORKING WITH PARTNERS LIKE THE LIBRARY. COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS UNDERSTANDING THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE SO THAT WE CAN REACH OUT DIRECTLY TO THOSE MEMBERS THAT ACTUALLY NEED THE PLATFORM MOST. AND WHAT WAS IS AYE I DO FIVE. REMEMBER THAT THE LAUNCH OF ON OR CALIFORNIA BUT I'M NOT ACTUALLY AS FAMILIAR WITH- HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT WAS AND HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS ACTUALLY UTILIZE THE PROGRAM AND HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS ACTUALLY. GOT JOBS AS A RESULT OF THAT PROGRAM ABSOLUTELY- AND I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH SOME REAL SOME REAL DATA POINTS ABOUT I CAN'T SAY THAT WITHIN. A FEW DAYS OF LAUNCHING THE PLATFORM OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CALIFORNIANS WERE USING THEIR PLATFORM USAGE AND THEN THE ACTUAL YOU KNOW SUCCESS RATE I RECOGNIZE THOSE ARE DIFFERENT AND PART OF WHAT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE AND THE NEXT ROUND OF TOOLS. IS ACTUALLY DOING MORE OF THAT DIRECT SUPPORT SERVICE EVEN JUST THAT YOU KNOW AND COMPANIES LIKE LINKEDIN CAN'T TRAP OF THE ACTUAL SUCCESS RATE OF FOLKS GETTING PLACE TO JOB THAT'S NOT THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED. SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED TO INFUSE IN THE PLOT FORWARD. TO ACTUALLY TRACK DOWN THOSE OUTCOMES AND A MORE HOLISTIC WAY ON IT GAP WELL AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH WITH THE POINTS THAT THAT YOU HAVE MADE- IN TERMS OF KIND OF A VERY URGENT NEED. TO UPSKILL AND RESKILL WORKERS IN OUR INCREASINGLY TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN ECONOMY THE ONE QUESTION I DO HAVE IS. THAT IN A WAY IF WE'RE TRYING TO REACH A GROUP OF FOLKS THAT. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO NAVIGATE EXISTING ONLINE TOOLS IS THE ANSWER ANOTHER ONLINE TOOL WHERE IS IT IS IT SOMETHING ALSO HAPPY YOU KNOW I'LL- SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT WOULD LOVE TO. THINK JUST CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAYS FOR OUT REACH TO COMMITTEES THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE INCREASINGLY GETTING LEFT BEHIND INDUCTOR AMBER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT AND YOU'RE CLOSE TO ME MAKE SURE THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEN NONE IF YOU WISH TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY UP LEFT MUCH OF THE WORK THAT THAT WAS INDUSTRIES HAS DONE ITSELF IT. DID BEGIN IN FRESNO BUT NOW IS EXTENDED TO BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED TO OAKLAND AND I BELIEVE JUST THIS WEEK YOU'VE ANNOUNCED EXPANDING INTO BUFFALO TOLEDO EL PASO. AREAS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND MANY TIMES IT'S THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THEMSELVES WHO. DON'T HAVE THESE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN TACK IT WAS INDUSTRIES ITSELF WITH JAKE'S OVERALL AS ITS CO CEO AND- MY OLD IN JUNIOR WHO I WANT. TO UPLIFT HERE WHO HAS RE- IN AND- COMES FROM THE FORMER. COME WHO KNOWS THE SEE OF THE COMPANY THAT IS. INVESTING WOMEN. AND CAN OF. TO BE INVOLVED IN TACK. WE REALLY ARE DOING SOMETHING INNOVATIVE HERE I'VE LOVED THE PARTNERSHIPS. AND ONE UP LIFT THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN DO IT EFFECTIVELY- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY TWO HUNDRED HERE TODAY SO WE CAN ESTABLISH THIS GRANT PROGRAM.
