WITH PROP SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT IT IS HELPING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM IS THIS. THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY GOING OUT TO COUNTIES THAT GENERALLY DO A VERY GOOD JOB WITH THE MONEY. BUT THE STATE IS NOT PROVIDED A STRATEGIC FOCUS FOR WHAT PROBLEMS WE ACTUALLY ONE ASSAULT WITH THAT MONEY. PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION IT WILL AMOUNT TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THE REASON I CENTER WIENERS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT IS THAT WITHOUT MANDATING OR MICRO MANAGING WHAT COUNTY SHOULD DO IT SAYS. CAN YOU PLEASE SPEND THE MONEY ON ONE OF FOUR KEY CATEGORIES. DRAMA BASED CARE FOR PEOPLE AMONG THE AGE ABOUT AGE SPAN. BOB COLLEGE BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EARLY PSYCHOSIS IDENTIFICATION INTERVENTION AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT SERVICES. AND SO WE JUST SEEK. TO TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BALANCE HERE IN DIRECTIONS SO THAT THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CAN BE SPENT IN A WAY THAT THE STATE CAN LOOK AND SAY. WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING REAL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MY NAME IS LAURA OVER ALMOST AND I'M HERE TODAY IS AN AFFECTED FAMILY MEMBER. HOME I LIKE TO SHARE TWO PHOTOS THAT I HAVE GOOD BY ME. THE FIRST PHOTO IS WITH MY SON AS A YOUNG ADULT ON GETTING READY TO START OFF TO COLLEGE WHEN HE FIRST STARTED TO MANIFEST SIGNS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE SECOND -- IT'S A FEW WEEKS OLD THAT I DURING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON VISIT. SO AS I STATED EARLIER MY NAME IS LAURA MOST AND I'M AN AFFECTED FAMILY MEMBER. MY SON JONATHAN RAMEAU'S WAS RACING SACRAMENTO GRADUATED FROM JESUIT HIGH SCHOOL AND WAS ACCEPTED INTO FORDHAM UNIVERSITY. JONATHAN WAS GAINFULLY EMPLOYED INVOLVED IN ACADEMICS EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND ENGAGE WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS HE IS TRULY A REMARKABLE HUMAN. JONATHAN'S LONG TERM GOAL WAS TO ATTEND COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND PURSUE HIS ACADEMIC ENDEAVORS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS. A BRILLIANT INCAPABLE MIND INDEED. A YOUNG MAN WITH NO HISTORY OF VIOLENCE NO HISTORY CRIMINALITY NO ISSUES WITH ALCOHOL OR DRUG DRUG SUBSTANCE ABUSE. BUT HE STRUGGLED WITH MENTAL HEALTH. WHEN JONATHAN WAS? TWENTY ONE HE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE HE IMMEDIATELY REACHED OUT TO COUNTY EP I TRAGICALLY HE MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT RECEIVE IT. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF NOT RECEIVING THE PROPER EP I JONATHAN AT THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO WAS SENTENCED TO AN INDETERMINATE LIFE SENTENCE. JONATHAN NOW LIVES IN A CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON. WHY I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO VISIT HIM WEEKLY? I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I KNOW THAT 50% OF ALL MENTAL ILLNESS BEGINS AT AGE. FOURTEEN AND 75% BUT THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR I KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE BECAUSE IT IS OUR LIVED EXPERIENCE. IT IS NOT FAIR THAT ONLY TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES HAVE EVIDENCE BASED EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS.

TODAY I COME TO YOU OFFER AS A MAN WHO HAS SPENT. MANY MANY HOURS MENTORING. AND VOLUNTEERING FOR MANY HIGH RISK YOUTH PARTICULARLY YOUTH OF COLOR. I REPRESENT MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. WHO CANNOT TRAVEL HERE SACRAMENTO TODAY TO TALK TO YOU? WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL. THAT THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED. SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE. BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME SECTION OF THE BILL THAT ARE VERY CONCERNING. KNOWING TO COMMITTEES OF COLOR BUT TO HARD TO REACH GROUPS AS WELL. THIS SECTION OF THE BILL AVERAGE ENGAGEMENT THAT. TARGETS TRANSITION AID YOUTH STILL POWERS TYPE PRIORITIZES UP. STUDENTS ENROLLED IN COLLEGE. WE'RE NOT ARGUING THAT STUDENTS IN COLLEGE WHO USE MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE'RE STILL UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WOULD BE A PRIORITY ON THEM OVER YOUTH WERE NOT ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE ESPECIALLY HIGH RISK YOU. WHO ARE DISTRICT PROPORTIONING ANA COLLEGE YOUTH OF COLOR? FOSTER CARE YOU FROM LGBT Q. YOUTH AND BALLOT IN VIOLENCE. YOUTH INTIMIDATED WITH GANGS. YOUTH WHO ARE IN TRANSITION. FURTHERMORE YOUTH WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE OFTEN NOT ABLE TO ENTER OR RE ENTER COLLEGE BECAUSE OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND FRANKLY MANY OF THESE YOUTH. OR EVEN ANGLO. WE WANT TRANSITION AGE YOUTH. WHO HAVE POTENTIAL MOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS TO BE SERVICE AND HAVE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS? WHY WE FAVOR THOSE IN COLLEGE WHEN MANY OF THOSE YOUTH ARE PRIVILEGED AND THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS ON EVERY CAMPUS AREN'T THOSE YOUTH? AS EVER DESERVING OF THOSE WHO WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE GOING TO COLLEGE. I WISH I COULD SAY THAT THERE WERE MANY MENTAL HEALTH PREVENTION PROGRAMS. AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND NEIGHBORHOODS WERE GRAYSON AT THE COMMUNITY EXISTS. BUT WE KNOW THIS IS NOT THE CASE. YOU THERE YOU IT WOULD BE EASY TO REMOVE THE PREFERENCE FOR COLLEGE PROGRAMS. NOT TOO LONG AGO AS I CLOSE NAFTA AMERICAN TRANSITION AID YOU IN THIS CITY OF SACRAMENTO STEPHEN CLARK. TRAGICALLY KILLED BY POLICE AND GRANDMOTHER'S BACKYARD. HIS GRIEVING BROTHERS TO VONTADE ALSO A TRANSITION AGE YOUTH EXHIBITED SIGNS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND EVEN HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED SHORTLY AFTER THIS INCIDENT. TO MY UNDERSTANDING NEITHER OF THESE YOUNG MEN WERE COLLEGE KIDS [inaudible] SO THEREFORE. I'M HERE TODAY. AND THESE YOUNG MAN. AND MANY COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THEM FROM. THE BORDER TOWNS OF CHULA VISTA. SKID ROW TO COMPTON. TO HEAR IN SACRAMENTO TO THE RULE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITIES LIKE IN OXNARD. THEY WILL BE [inaudible] MS STOVER [inaudible] PLEASE. EXPAND THIS PROGRAM TO ALL YOU THINK. JANET FRANK -- I'M A FACULTY MEMBER AT UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE ONE AND ONLY STUDY THAT'S BEEN DONE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT AND OLDER ADULTS. SOMEBODY TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT MY STUDY. AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. IN RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION AND EARLIER VAN AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS FOR OLDER ADULTS -- I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. ONE IS THE ENTIRE -- ISSUE OF THE COMMISSION -- SETTING THE PRIORITIES RATHER THAN. THE ARE A HALLMARK REALLY OF THE MHSAA WHICH WAS -- WHICH IS A ROBUST LOCAL STAKEHOLDER. SO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT NOT. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A I BELIEVE IN AMENDED PORTION PUT INTO THE BILL THAT IF COUNTIES. ONE AND TWO IDENTIFY PROGRAMS THAT WERE OUTSIDE THE PRIORITIES OF THE YOUTH AND TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH -- THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO ADDITIONAL WORK AND SO THIS OF COURSE IS A DISINCENTIVE. FOR COUNTIES TO ARM. TO PROMOTE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE -- OTHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS THOSE FOR ADULTS AND OLDER ADULTS. THAT THIS CREATES A DOUBLE STANDARD. AND I BELIEVE THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SHOULD BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD IF IF THEY GO FORWARD. MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS REALLY HOW THE DID DEFINITION IN THE BILL. IS AROUND OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WHICH IS QUITE LIMITED AND FOCUSED AS I QUOTE HERE. ON A SECONDARY SCHOOL IN TRANSITION AGE YOUTH WHAT THE PRIORITY ON PARTNERING WITH COLLEGES -- I AGREE THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE IMPORTANT. BUT CURRENTLY -- THERE IS QUITE A DISPARITY IN THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING GIVEN TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. AND A MENTAL HEALTH -- COMMISSION STUDY. I ACTUALLY SHOWED THAT CURRENTLY AROUND 80%. OF FUNDING OF FUNDING FOR PREVENTION PROGRAMS IS GOING TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH. ABOUT 19% TO ADULTS AND ONE POINT 5% TO OLDER ADULTS. THIS BILL WILL LASSEN AN INCREASE THAT DISPARITY EVEN FURTHER. SO I BELIEVE THAT OLDER ADULTS SHOULD ACTUALLY BE OUR PRIORITY POPULATION. FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY REVIEW SOME OF THOSE. THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT RISK OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS DO TO FAILING HEALTH ISOLATION ECONOMIC AND SECURITY. AND VULNERABILITY TO EXPLOITATION. OLDER ADULTS ARE THE LARGEST OUR FASTEST GROWING AGE COHORT IN THE NATION AND ALSO IN CALIFORNIA. A IT WILL SOON BE 20%. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH. BOB ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION JUST STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION A POSITION ONLY. CAROL SO FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION WE REQUEST THAT YOU CONSIDER ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS AS SOMETHING THANK YOU SO MUCH LAST WEEK APPRECIATE IT ANYMORE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION. HE HAD THERE ARE CAL TO WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING [inaudible] WE OPPOSE [inaudible] THANK YOU. JANET HEATH MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM SIDE ASSOCIATION WE OPPOSE. PLEASE A COLEMAN CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. JEFF TARGET KIA HAPTIC IT UNINTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCES CARA OWL -- LET'S SEE THANK YOU JOHN REPRISE JUST. YOU ASKED ORGANIZATIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BRING IT BACK HIS ANYMORE LOVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOD WANTS BRING IT BACK ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OR YES MISTER CHAIRMAN. I THINK MISTER CHAIR I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL. ARM AND IN ALL THOSE WHO -- PROVIDED TESTIMONY LIKE TO THANK OUR WITNESSES FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN SHARING YOUR YOUR SON'S EXPERIENCE. IN PROVIDING THE CONTEXT Y. MORE IS NEEDED -- THANK YOU SENATOR STEINBERG AND ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA -- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN -- I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS COMMISSION -- AND I'VE SPENT A GOOD PART OF MY CAREER DOING WORK -- FOR MIDDLE HEALTH AGENCIES -- WITH YOUTH AND SOMETIMES IT SENIORS. AND AND I KNOW THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND I DO IT TO THE AUTHOR -- IS VERY THOUGHTFUL AND INCLUSIVE AND HOW HE APPROACHES -- ANYTHING THAT HE WORKS ON AND SO. I I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE AUTHOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT. THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES FOR FOR SAYING THAT -- ABSOLUTELY WE SHOULD SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE STRESS WHILE IN COLLEGE BUT WE ABSOLUTELY MUST SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE WHEREVER THEY ARE. AS WE SAY IN SOCIAL WORK WE SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE WHEREVER THEY ARE AND IT YOU SHOULD HAVE GOOD COLLEGE GET THOSE SERVICES I DON'T. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS BILL TO MAKE THAT DIFFERENTIATION IN AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THE SENATOR SPEAK. TO THAT END TO IN TO SPEAK TO ON HOW HOW SENIORS WOULD BE SERVED YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW I WORK IN A I WORKED IN AN AGENCY THAT USED. MEDI CAL JUST PROVIDE SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WE'D NEVER HAD ENOUGH. TO SERVE ALL THOSE WHO NEEDED IT AND SO WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE ARE DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED FOR EVER REASON. WE GOT A FAIR WITH THOSE BARRIERS ARE GET THOSE DOLLARS INTO THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS INTO COUNTY PROGRAMS INTO SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS INTO SENIOR PROGRAMS. BUT GET THE SERVICES FUNDED SO THAT THE WORK CAN CAN BE ENHANCED AND WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN SUICIDE. UP IN STRESS -- IN TRAMO IN SO I APPRECIATE WOODS IS GOING TO LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR. SPEAK DIRECTLY TO OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT SENIORS NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES AND UNDERPRIVILEGED YOUTH. THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT QUESTION THAT SOMEONE -- AND I THINK UP FOR SO SOME OF THE TENSION NEVER SEEN HERE HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT SERVICES SYSTEM IN GENERAL. IN THIS COUNTRY IS UNDER FUNDED AND SO UNFORTUNATELY WE IT WITH LIMITED RESOURCES SOMETIMES AS A PUSH IN A POLL. BUT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT. PART OF MONEY IT'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ODDS ARE GROWING TO THAT AMOUNT WILL PROBABLY GROW MORE -- AND SO THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING A TO GO AROUND EVEN THOUGH WE ALWAYS NEED TO DO MORE -- THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY. LIMIT THE ABILITY OF COUNTIES HAVE FUN SERVICES FOR SENIORS THE FUND SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN COLLEGE. OUGHT TO FIND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE FOR KIPPER PEOPLE ON THE LGBT COMMUNITY OR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OR ANY COMMUNITY THAT THAT NEED SUPPORT. AND I WANNA POINT TO A FEW THINGS. WE REPEATEDLY AND THIS BILL TALK USE THE PRAISE ACROSS THEIR LIFESPAN. WE USE THAT IN THE PART TALKING ABOUT UNDERSERVED CULTURAL POPULATIONS -- WE USE IT AND ITEM ARE IN THE IN TERMS OF THE FIVE PRIORITIES -- NUMBER TWO TALKS ABOUT -- EARLY PSYCHOSIS AND NEW DISORDER DETENTION INTERVENTION INCLUDING MOOD DISORDER PROGRAMMING THAT OCCURS ACROSS. THE LIFESPAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIVE CATEGORIES -- TWO OF THEM ARE ABOUT YOUTH CHILD EARLY HIGH CHILDHOOD TRAUMA AND THEN -- A RETURN ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOCUSING ON CAUGHT KIDS IN COLLEGE THE OTHER THREE ARE. FOR ANYONE OF ANY AGE COLLEGE NOT COLLEGE SO THREE OF THE FIVE ARE NOT SPECIFIC A TO YOUNG PEOPLE. TO OUR AYE AND THAT MEANS THAT FOR KIDS WHO ARE NOT IN COLLEGE FOUR OF THE FIVE APPLY TO THEM DOESN'T ONLY. ONE THAT TALKS ABOUT AN EMPHASIS ON KIDSWHO ARE IN COLLEGE LIKE THE CSU KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN COMING OUT. SUPPORT THIS BILL SO THIS -- THIS BILL DOES NOT BLOCK SENIORS OUT DOES NOT BOX ANYONE OUT -- THE OTHER THING I WON I'D NOTICE I THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE BEFORE ABOUT HOW THE COMMISSION SETS. STANDARDS AND THEN IT TAKES THEM TAKE A LOT OF WORK. TO TRY TO CHANGE IT AYE YOU LOOK AT IT IS -- ALL FIVE EIGHT FOUR POINT SEVEN DE. WHERE IT SAYS PACIFIC LATE? I COUNTY MAY INCLUDE OTHER PRIORITIES AS DETERMINED THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS EITHER IN PLACE OF OR IN ADDITION TO THE ESTABLISH PRIORITIES. IF THE COUNTY CHOOSES TO INCLUDE OTHER PROGRAMS THE PLAN SHALL INCLUDE DESCRIPTION. OF WHY THOSE PROGRAMS ARE INCLUDED AND METRICS BY WHICH EFFECT IN THIS. OF THOSE PROGRAMS IS TO BE MEASURED AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT IN ADDITION TO THE BROAD FLEXIBILITY IN THE FIVE CATEGORIES. THAT A COUNTY CAN SELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE SOME DIFFERENT NEEDS -- WE WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY BUT WE ARE REQUIRING THEM. TO BE RIGOROUS ABOUT IT AND THE SAY WHY THEY'RE DOING THAT HOW THEY'RE GONNA DO IT WHAT ARE THE METRICS. AS PART OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH -- DAMAGE TO SAY. IS WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ACCOUNTABILITY OR STRUCTURE. SOME COUNTIES DO REALLY WELL SOME COUNTIES -- LESS SO SOME COUNTIES THAT ARE IN SPENDING THE MONEY AT ALL -- AND SO WE WANT TO SAYS AT LEAST REQUIRE. I AND THEN FINALLY I'M IN TERMS OF COMMITTEES WERE REACHING. ALL COMMUNITIES YEAH WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL IN WORKING WITH SOME OF THE OPPONENTS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THEM. CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGE IN WITH US MAYBE NOT EVERYONE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR BUT WE MADE AMENDMENTS TO REALLY ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. I AM WE HAVE FOR PRIORITY NUMBER FOUR CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS -- YEAR WE HAVE -- I THINK A REALLY BROAD DEFINITIONS BECAUSE BUT SOMEONE WHO -- YOU KNOW COMES FROM A COMMUNITY OF LGBT COMMUNITY WHERE YOU KNOW THAT IS A VERY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITY A LOT OF WAYS WHERE HE ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND SENIORS EX STRUGGLE ALIVE. I WOULD THAT WOULD BE THE LAST THING I'D EVER WANT TO DO IT TO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA. FOCUS ON ALL COMMUNITIES SO I RESPECT THE OPPOSITION -- BUT I DO BELIEVE WE'VE ADDRESSED -- THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU SOONER I I YOU KNOW I'M AND I'M PREPARED SPORTS ABILITY DAY I WILL OWN WHENEVER WE HAVE QUORUM I'M HAPPY TO MAKE MOTION I I LIKE TO ASK YOU TO KEEP WORKING WORKS. WITH THOSE WHO'VE RAISE CONCERNS I SUSPECT A LOT OF THIS ABOUT THE CHANGE AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW THE DOLLARS THAT HADN'T BEEN ALLOCATED SHOULD GET USE AND I THINK THAT CREATES SOME TENSIONS IN AND OF ITSELF. AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN HEAR ALL PERSPECTIVES ABOUT HOW WE MAKE THIS WORK THE BETTER IN THIS -- ONE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE DOING THAT -- BUT HABITS PORTUGAL DAY AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION -- TO TO TO AS YOUR SHAPING EXCEPT THAT WE HAVE A GREAT COMMISSION AND I KNOW THAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS HERE THAT'S GREAT STAFF ON THIS COMMISSION GREAT COMMISSIONERS. OUR THAT HAS A PROCESS FOR INPUT IS THERE SOME KIND OF A FRAMEWORK FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GIVE MORE INPUT. ABOUT HOW THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL WOULD GET SHAPED -- I YES ON THE BILL DOES REQUIRE STAKEHOLDER INPUT I WOULD DEFER TO THE COMMISSION TO TALK ABOUT THEIR PROCESS UP BUT I WILL ALSO SAY WE ABSOLUTELY ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING DIALOGUE.

WE'VE OFFICIALLY REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL UNTIL -- WE SEE SOMETHING MORE FINAL JUST ARE ON ANOTHER NOTE -- THE REASON WE OPPOSE A THESE TYPES OF COPYCAT BILLS IS BECAUSE THESE PRICE CONTROLS ON OR BENEFIT HAVE A NEGATIVE CORRESPONDING IMPACT ON PREMIUMS -- THE SUNSET THAT WAS ADDED TO THIS BILL CERTAINLY IS HELPFUL ON IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE SUNSET ROLLS AROUND WE THINK OF A PROPER. ANALYSIS BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS IN REVIEW PROGRAM -- THAT WOULD BE TO ANALYZE WHAT THE POSITIVE IMPACT OR PREMIUM RELIEF WOULD BE -- IF THESE COPAKE CAPS -- WERE ON EXPIRED OR MODIFIED ON BECAUSE THE MONTHLY PREMIUM IS ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT FOLKS -- WHO WERE SHOPPING FOR COVERAGE SO -- WITH THOSE COMMENTS -- WE LOOK FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION SEEING HOW LANGUAGE SHAPES OUT IN THE FINAL VERSION SO THANK YOU.

THE COMMISSION AGREED AND CONDUCTED AT A YEAR LONG STUDY OF THE PROGRAM WITH A FOCUS ON HOW TO IMPROVE. THE DENTAL CALLISON OFFICES. THROUGH HEARINGS IN INTERVIEWS OF STAKEHOLDERS MANY WHO WERE EXPERTS IN DENTISTRY TREATMENT AND CARE. THE COMMISSION HEARD COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES UNILATERAL DECISION MAKING. COMMISSIONERS LEARNED THAT THIS LACK OF MEANINGFUL COMMUNICATION. BETWEEN DATE D. EIGHT C. A. S. M. STAKEHOLDERS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ACCESS CARE. WE RECEIVE SUGGESTIONS FOR AN EVIDENCE BASED ADVISORY COMMITTEE. TO ASSESS THE DECISION MAKING. ABDI EIGHT CS WITH. RECIPROCALLY WITH REGARD TO DENY CAO. AFTER DELIBERATION AND THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION THE COMMISSION AGREED. THAT THE CREATION OF AN EVIDENCE BASED ADVISORY GROUP WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO ASSESS AND IMPROVE DE EIGHT C. S.'S POLICYMAKING PROCESS. WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRATS? THE COMMISSION MADE THIS RECOMMENDATION IN ITS APRIL TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORT CALLED FIXING DINNER CAL. LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION SUPPORTED A PREVIOUS VERSION OF SB SEVEN OF SEVEN THAT WAS S. B.

ALSO ONE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ESPECIALLY I'M EXPANDING THE FOCUS OF THE GROUP TO INCLUDE ADULTS AS WELL AS CHILDREN WHENEVER INITIAL REQUEST WAS MADE. THERE WAS NO ADULT PROGRAM SO WE THINK THAT I'M ANY ADVICE RECOUP REALLY DOES NEED TO LOOK AT ADULTS. THEY WERE ALSO SAY THAT AND WE CONTINUE TO THINK THAT I'M MORE A SMALLER AND MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED ADVISORY GROUP WOULD BE MORE BENEFICIAL. AND BUT POTENTIALLY LESS DUPLICATIVE OF THE EXISTING STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THAT ARE OUT THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THEM WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE I PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE BENEFIT PACKAGE THE COVERED CODES. SOMETHINGS ARE VERY CLINICAL AND VERY EVIDENCE BASED THAT MAKE SURE THAT THE DENTAL PROGRAM.

YOU HAVE FOR BILLS BEFORE US SENATOR HERNANDEZ IF THEY DO MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON. YOU DON'T MIND CAN WE START OFF WITH S. B. NINE TEN PERFECT THINK SO MUCH. AS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THIS BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT SHORT TERM LIMITED DURATION HEALTH INSURANCE MAY NOT BE SOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THESE POLICIES REQUIRE EXTENSIVE HEALTH QUESTION YEARS USED BY THE CARRY TO RATHER DENY COVERAGE. OR EXCLUDE COVERAGE IF THE PERSON IS ALLOWED TO PURCHASE ONE OF THESE POLICIES. YEAH VARIOUS SIDE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNTS THEY HAVE BENEFIT LIFETIME BENEFITS OF UP TO SEVEN AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND THEY DO HAVE PREEXISTING CONDITION EXCLUSIONS. THE POLICY WILL NOT PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR ANY LOSS CAUSED BY OR RESULTING PRE EXISTING CONDITION THEY DEFINE A PRE EXISTING CONDITION AS ANY MEDICAL CONDITION. OR SICKNESS FOR WHICH THE MEDICAL ADVICE CARE DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT CONSULTATION MEDICATION WITH A RECOMMENDATION RECEIVE FROM A DOCTOR WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS. IMMEDIATE PRECEDING THE COVERED PERSONS EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE OR SYMPTOMS WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS AMELIA PRIOR TO COVERAGE THAT WOULD CAUSE A REASONABLE PERSON TO SEEK DIAGNOSIS CARE. OR TREATMENT. I HAVE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF SEEMINGLY HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE HARMED BY THESE PRODUCTS WHO HAD A RIGHT TO RESORT TO LITIGATION TO GET THEIR BILLS PAID. AND SOME OF THE COURTS THEN RULE IN THE FAVOR THE POLICYHOLDER BECAUSE OF THE PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. THE PROPONENTS OF SHORT TERM LIMIT IT -- INSURANCE -- ARGUE THAT THERE ARE NEEDED FOR LIFE TRANSITIONS ARE SOMETIMES WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE IN BETWEEN JOBS. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AS WE KNOW HAS SPECIAL ROMAN PERIOD IF THE TRANSITION HAPPENS. OUTSIDE OF OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD IN AN ELIGIBLE PERSON CAN ROLE IN MEDI CAL IT ANYTIME. THE YEAR MEDI CAL HAS NO OPEN ROMAN PERIOD. SHORT TERM INSURANCE RESULTS AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PLANS BY DRAWING THE YOUNGER HEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS OUT OF THE ACA MARKET. AND INTO AND REENTER WHEN THEY HAVE HEALTHY OR CARE CRISIS. THE PROMOTION OF THESE PLANS IS THE SABOTAGE IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHEN KERRY OF THE PRODUCT IS OFFERING HIGH COMMISSION RATES AS HIGH AS 22%. TO INSURANCE AGENTS WITH BONUSES FOR SHORT TERM PLANS WITHOUT MEMBERS THEY HAVE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE NAME INDIVIDUALS LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHEN MEMBERS MANAGING FORESTS ON BEHALF OF HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA AT THE STATEWIDE HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT S. B. NINE TEN WHICH WOULD BAN THE SALE OF SHORT TERM INSURANCE WHICH ARE JUNK INSURANCE PLANS. SHORT TERM INSURANCE PROVIDES VERY LIMITED BENEFITS AND IS NOT OFFERED THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS OR ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. THAT A CA PLANTS DO PEOPLE CAN BE DENIED FOR PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS AND ALSO BENEFITS ARE LIMITED. CONSUMERS CAN ALREADY GET SHORT TERM COVERAGE FROM COVER CALIFORNIA SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN COVER CALIFORNIA HAS SERVED MORE THAN THIRTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE. HALF OF THEM HAVE HAD COVERAGE FOR LESS THAN A YEAR. CONSUMERS WHO GO TO COVER CALIFORNIA FOR COVERAGE P SUBSIDIES TO HELP PAY FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. ANDTHEY CAN GET COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE WITH NO PRE EXISTING CONDITION DENIALS. CONSUMERS WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS AND BECOME UNEMPLOYED TEMPORARILY CAN GET MEDI CAL AT ZERO COST. FOR PREMIUMS AND ALSO COPAYS. WE HAVE LOOKED THAT SHORT TERM INSURANCE AND TRIED TO FIGURE OUT IF IT'S USEFUL TO CONSUMERS AND WHAT YOU WILL HEAR THE OPPOSITION SAY IS THAT IF PEOPLE MISSED THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIODS. THEY CANNOT GET COVERAGE. THAT IS PARTLY RIGHT AND PARTLY WRONG IF SOMEONE LOSES THEIR COVERS BECAUSE THEY LOSE THEIR JOB THEY GET DIVORCED OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD. THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA OR THROUGH MEDI CAL. WHAT ABOUT IF SOMEBODY MISSES THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD AND DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR SPECIAL ENROLLMENT? WE HAVE OPEN ENROLLMENT AND SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIODS FOR A REASON I'M DOING THE STRUCTURE OF OPEN ENROLLMENT AND SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIODS ON THOSE ARE INDIVIDUAL MARKET RULES AND ALSO DESTABILIZES OR INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE MARKETS. WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY INCREASE PREMIUMS FOR CONSUMERS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED. SABOTAGE I'M DUE THE ACA AND THAT IS JUST WHAT IT DOES -- THOSE WHO WANT TO SELL THESE PRODUCTS WANT TO UNDO THE ECA FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON BETSY IN HOPES FOR CONSUMERS UNION THE ADVOCACY DIVISION OF CONSUMER REPORT SOME ALSO A CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVE AT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS WHERE THIS ISSUE OF SHORT TERM PLANS. AND AS A MATTER OF CONCERN. NUMBER PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TO MATT MITIGATE THE EXPECTED DAMAGE FROM THE FEDERAL RULE WHICH IS DUE OUT ANY DAY NOW ONTO X. INTENDED TO EXPAND THE USE OF SHORT TERM I INSURANCE POLICIES WITH LIMITED COVERAGE. CONSUMER REPORTS IS CALLED THESE LOW VALUE PLANS JUNK INSURANCE A FULL OF GARAGES AND GIMMICKS ALL THE THINGS THAT MADE US -- SUPPORT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON REFORMS TO BEGIN WITH. I'M WE ARE ALREADY SEEING MORE AGGRESSIVE ON AND DECEPTIVELY -- MARKETED PRODUCTS OF THIS KIND AND EXPECT A SPIKE IN MARKETING -- AS THESE -- PLANS CARRY COMMISSIONS THAT ARE SIX TO EIGHT TIMES WE UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF COMMISSIONS FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PLANS. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE THAT CAME TO CONSUMERS UNION BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BUT WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED AS A SHORT TERM PLAN TODAY. ON JUDITH BELIEVED HER HEALTH PLAN -- THAT SHE BUT WAS COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE ONLY WHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER DID SHE LEARN OF IT SEVERE LIMITATIONS THE THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT FOR CHEMOTHERAPY ON AN OUTPATIENT BASIS AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. LIMIT FOR HOSPITALIZATION. FACING A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL -- ESTIMATE SHE DELAYED HER TREATMENT UNTIL THE SURGEON SAID WE CAN'T YOU CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER IT WAS THREE CENTIMETERS WHEN THEY FOUND IT AND NINE CENTIMETERS WHEN THEY TOOK IT OUT REQUIRING A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. ON END OF RADIATION AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND SHE WAS LEFT WITH A TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLAR A HOSPITAL BILL WE DON'T WANT OTHER CONSUMERS STUCK WITH THIS KIND OF BIND THAT DEVASTATE BOTH THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR FAMILY FINANCES -- MISS FLORES IS DESCRIBE THE THINGS THAT ARE LACKING IN THESE POLICIES THEY AIM TO ATTRACT YOUNGER AND HEALTHIER. OF CONSUMERS AND THEREFORE WOULD DRAIN THE AND SIPHON OFF THOSE HEALTHY CONSUMERS FROM THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET THE OVERALL RESULT WILL BE A FRAGMENTED DESTABILIZED INDIVIDUAL MARKET. A IN THE STATE WITH HIGHER COSTS FOR THOSE COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE THAT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WOULD ALLOW ON NINE TEN WOULD AVERT THESE PROBLEMS AND WE URGE YOUR STRONG SUPPORT TO PUT CALIFORNIA IN THE FOREFRONT WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER STATES THAT HAVE.

HOWEVER WE ASK FOR SOME CONSIDERATION OF SOME AMENDMENTS. MAKING THESE PLANS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THOSE WHO OR OTHERWISE PROHIBITED FOR PURCHASING OTHER COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE. UNTIL THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD MAKING THEM NON RENEWABLE. AND JUST KEEPING THEM AND LIKE I SAID A SHORTER PERIOD SO I CAN GET THEM TO THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD. ONE OF OUR GOALS AT WE FOUND IS THAT A LOT EASIER TO TRANSITION SOMEONE FROM A SHORT TERM PLAN TO A MORE PERMANENT COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE. THAT IS IF WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE DON'T WANT TO REPLACE THESE ARE USED THESE IN PLACE OF CONFERENCE OF COVERAGE WE WANTED JUST BASICALLY GUIDE THEM TO THE PATH. TO ENSURE STABILITY SO. ALSO WOODS ONE REFERENCE NUMBER THE EXAMPLES THAT WERE ISSUE JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO. TEND TO BE UP FOR PRACTICES THAT ARE NOT COMMON IN CALIFORNIA THAT TEND TO BE MORE OUT OF STATE TYPE OF PRACTICES. THIS IS A VERY VERY SMALL SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO AN OFFICE LIKE MINE IN NEED COVERAGE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO THIS IS ONE TOOL THAT WE HAVE LEFT IN THE TOOLBOX TO USE. SO WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WE THINK IT CAN BE DOABLE. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IF HE'S OPEN TO THESE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU.

TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT PERFECT THANK YOU WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND ACCEPT A HAS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THE LANGUAGE SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT THE CERTIFICATION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY. AND I COMMIT TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT IN THE NEXT POLICY COMMITTEE. MEMBERS AS WE TALK TWENTY EIGHT DEFINES ADVANCE PATIENT BROKE GRAIN WHICH MEANS REFERRING A PATIENT IN EXCHANGE FOR A KICKBACK. COMMISSION OR ANY KIND OF ECONOMIC BENEFIT AYE AS WE TALK TO ME IT ALSO RAISES NONCLINICAL STANDARDS FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE. USE DISORDER CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM ABUSE BILLS INCLUDE TRANSPIRE TRANSPARENT FINANCIAL RULES REPORTING OF PATIENT DEATHS ARE OCCURRING NALOXONE WHICH IS -- THE OVERDOSE PREVENTING DRUG AVAILABLE WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES LICENSE RECOVERY PROGRAMS TO REFER PATIENTS TO ONLY FACILITIES THAT PROTECT PATIENTS -- FROM PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL ABUSE TO DO THIS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WILL SELECT A CERTIFYING ORGANIZATION THAT WILL ENSURE HIGH STANDARDS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. HELLO EVERYONE I AM WAY SCHNEIDER AND A CEO AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CASA TREATMENT CENTER. IN PASADENA CASA HAS BEEN AND OF PROVIDING ADDICTION TREATMENT SERVICES SINCE. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AS ONE OF THE FIRST GENDER SPECIFIC TREATMENT CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY OUR PROGRAM IS DESIGNED. TO ADDRESS THE IT FOR A DIVERSE AND UNIQUE NEEDS OF WOMEN WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. ARE TREATMENT APPROACHES ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH BEHAVIOR. SAYS ENTER PROVIDED THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF CARE. BECAUSE AS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WHOSE CORE VALUES INCLUDE QUALITY AND ETHICAL DELIVERY OF SERVICES WE DO NOT PATIENT WE WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN CLIENT BROKERING. AND WE DO NOT OFFER RECEIVER ENUMERATION FOR CLIENT REFERRALS. I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE FIELD OF ADDICTION TREATMENT FOR A THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BY EQUAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND ATTACKED ADDICTIVE DISORDERS. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF TWO THOUSAND TEN BEMBA HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY. PRIOR TO THE PASSAGES OF TO THE PASSAGE OF THESE ACTS ADDICTION TREATMENT AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE. WAS A LARGELY UNRECOGNIZED FIELD. THESE MONUMENTAL ACTS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON CREATING ACCESSIBILITY TO CARE IN NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO RECOVER FROM ADDICTION. BUT ALSO CAME WITH THE PASSAGE OF THESE ACTS WAS AN UNTAPPED PROFIT DRIVEN MARKET. CREATING COMPETITION OVER INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET MARKETS CAN DRIVE FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. THIS IS BEING EVIDENCED AN INCREASED FREQUENCY HEARING CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE SOME TREATMENT CENTERS ARE PROVIDING ARE SOME TREATMENT CENTER PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR INSURANCE PREMIUMS OF THEIR CLIENTS IN ADDITION TO COVERING THE COSTS OF THEIR HOUSING AND ENDS ABILITIES. THE COMPETITIVE MARKET HAS OFF ALSO DRIVEN UNETHICAL PRACTICES OF REFERRING CLIENTS BASED ON THEIR POTENTIAL PROFITABILITY. OVER THEIR MEDICAL CLINICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATIONS. I SUPPORT SB ONE TWO TO EIGHT BECAUSE IT WILL REINFORCE THE VALUE SYSTEMS THAT THE FIELD OF ADDICTION TREATMENT WAS FOUNDED ON HELPING OTHERS. BECAUSE AS A LONG HISTORY OF HELPING PEOPLE TRANSFORM THEIR LIVES BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP TO CONTINUE DOING OUR WORK. ETHICAL PROVIDERS LIKE US CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE GROWING NUMBER OF UNETHICAL PROVIDERS THAT ARE CAPITALIZING ON INDIVIDUALS IN A LIFE CRISIS. I SUPPORT SB ONE TWO TWO EIGHT BECAUSE IT WILL BE ON PATIENT BROKERING. BY LICENSE TREATMENT FACILITIES AND PROMOTE BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT ARE GROUNDED IN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. IT WILL PROTECT AGAINST FINANCIAL ABUSE AND ENCOURAGE NON DISCRIMINATION AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT BUSINESS PRACTICES. I SUPPORT SB. ONE TWO TWO EIGHT BECAUSE IT IS A STEP TOWARDS CREATING A TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT THAT IS FOCUSED ON WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PERSON. WHO IS SEEKING A LIFE IN RECOVERY FROM ADDICTION? I URGE YOU TO AND USE OF YOUR SUPPORT TO THIS LEGISLATION. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. AND A ONE WITH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY VAN BEHALF OF RECOVERY FROM NOW IN SUPPORT [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. TWO IN OPPOSITION. I'M SORRY MY HEARING A VERY GOOD I COULDN'T TELL WHO MOVED THE BILL. SO THIS BURKE OF THE BILL THANK YOU. SIR. HOW MISTER CHAIR MEMBER KURT CHILD THAT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA -- WE REGRETFULLY AND RESPECTFULLY -- OPPOSE THIS BILL PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE RESIDENCE -- CERTIFICATION PROVISIONS BILL SO I FIRST LET ME SAY THAT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF PROVISIONS THAT WOULD RESTRICT CREATION BROKERING THOSE HAVE A A HORRENDOUS EFFECT ON INDIVIDUALS -- WHO ARE IN THE -- TREATMENT -- CONTINUUM AND WE AGREE THAT THERE MUST BE RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THAT PRACTICE. BUT WE ARE OPPOSED -- TO THE CERTIFICATION OF PROGRAM THAT'S ESTABLISHED IN THE BILL AND HAVE HISTORICALLY EACH TIME THAT -- THESE COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES OPPOSE THOSE -- AND EVEN IF IT IS VOLUNTARY AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT. ARE BEING MADE TO BE TO CLARIFY THAT IT IS A FACT -- VOLUNTARILY VOLUNTARY BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT EVEN A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM STILL VIOLATES -- BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE FAIR HOUSING -- LAWS A IT'S A IT'S A RESTRICTION THAT IS BEING PLACED -- ON THESE OF RESIDENCES AND AGAIN A REMINDER THAT THESE ARE INDEED -- RESIDENTS AND NOT TREATMENT FACILITIES -- WITH A STATE SANCTIONED AND THEY ARE -- PROTECTED FROM THESE RESIDENCES ARE PROTECTED FROM -- RESTRICTIVE -- REGULATIONS AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE WHEN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THESE -- RESIDENTS ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND THEREFORE PROTECTED -- AS PERSONS WITH -- WITH DISABILITIES -- SO IT WHAT WHAT EVEN IN THE CASE WHERE IS THIS IS A A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM -- WHAT IT DOES IS HAS THE EFFECT OF ESSENTIALLY LIMITING -- FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY CHOOSE NOT TO LIVE IN THOSE -- ENTITIES AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE REFERRALS -- TO OTHER RESIDENTS THAT -- MAY NOT CHOOSE -- TO VOLUNTARILY -- PARTICIPATE SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS AMOUNTS TO AN END RUN ON TIME FAIR HOUSING LAWS AND WE'D ARCHER NO VOTE ON THE BILL.

MCCARTY AYE IS AARON RODRIGUEZ [inaudible] SANTIAGO [inaudible] THURMOND. THURMOND AYE RODRIGUEZ AYE AND WALDRON. THAT HAS NINE VOTES SO WILL BE THAT OPEN FOR OTHER STAND ITEMS TREMORS THINKS SO MUCH SENATOR SENATOR MITCHELL [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] SENATOR LYNCH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I'M HERE TO PRESENT -- SENATE BILL. TEN THIRTY FOUR IT'S A MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT BREAST TISSUE DENSITY ON THEIR FEDERALLY REQUIRED MAMMOGRAPHY WILL REPORT. IF THEY INDEED HAVE DENSE BREAST TISSUE. THROUGH THE KNOW THIS WOMAN RECEIVE CRITICAL INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR OWN BREAST TISSUE DENSITY IN THE GOOD OF THE BANK SINCE FOR BREAST CANCER RISK AND SCREENING. MAMMOGRAPHY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY BREAST CANCER SCREENING TOOL PROVEN TO REDUCE BREAST CANCER MORTALITY IT USES XRAY THROUGH TO VIEW THE BRASS. AND IS A FAST AND WIDELY AVAILABLE SCREENING METHOD. THE PROBLEM HOWEVER IS WHEN A WOMAN HAVE DENSE BREAST TISSUE. IT REFLECTS A DARKENED A MAMMOGRAM. WHERE US DENSE TISSUES APPEARS Y.? MAMMOGRAPHY RESULTS ARE REVIEWED VISUALLY BY PROVIDERS IN BOTH CANCER AND DENSE BREAST TISSUE APPEAR VISUALLY WIDE ON A MAMMOGRAM. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE. THE MAIN CAUSE A FALSE NEGATIVE MAMMOGRAPHY RESULTS ISN'T DUE TO HIGH BROWN'S DEATH BREAST DENSITY. THIS BILL IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS. WOMEN TO HAVE IN IT WOULD FORMED INFORMATION CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR DOCTORS ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTH AS EQUAL PARTNERS IN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WITH ME TODAY IS AMY COLTON A BREAST CANCER PREVENTION ADVOCATE AND SURVIVOR AND DOCTOR HARRIET BRONSKI MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF BREAST IMAGING AT MILLS PENINSULA MEDICAL CENTER. HI MY NAME IS AMY COLTON I'M A NURSE AND I'M FROM SANTA CRUZ. AND I AM THE CONSTITUENT WHO IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN APPROACH THEN SENATOR SANITY IN ABOUT LEGISLATION. TO INFORM PATIENTS ABOUT THEIR BREAST DENSITY. AND A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN BUT ONE THING THAT HASN'T CHANGED I MY PARALYZING FEAR OF PUBLIC SPEAKING. SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME AS READ MY STATEMENT ON UP BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I HAD RECENTLY RECOVERED FROM A BRUTAL BATTLE WITH ADVANCED STAGE BREAST CANCER. PRIOR TO MY DIAGNOSIS I HAD FAITHFULLY FOLLOWED THE GUIDELINES FOR SCREENINGS BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO ME I HAD DENSE BREAST TISSUE. THIS MEANT THAT MY MAMMOGRAM RESULTS WERE MUCH LESS ACCURATE AND I WAS AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. HAD I BEEN GIVEN THIS INFORMATION THERE IS A GREAT LIKELIHOOD THAT MY DIAGNOSIS WOULD HAVE COME EARLIER RESULTING IN A MORE FAVORABLE PROGNOSIS AND SPARING ME A GREAT DEAL OF SUFFERING. THE MOMENT I LEARNED THIS WAS THE MOMENT WHEN I DECIDED THAT NO OTHER WOMAN SHOULD EVER HAVE TO SUFFER A DELAYED BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS. UNNECESSARILY. THE INTENT OF SB TEN THIRTY FOUR IS TO EDUCATE AND RAISE AWARENESS SO THAT ALL PATIENTS HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCE FOR EARLY DETECTION. EVERY PATIENT SHOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION SHE NEEDS TO HAVE AN INFORMED DISCUSSION WITH HER PHYSICIAN ABOUT HER PERSONAL SET OF RISK FACTORS AND THE BEST PLAN OF SCREENING. BASED ON HER RISK FACTORS. IF THE LAW IS ALLOWED TO EXPIRE WE WILL GO BACK TO A TIME WHEN MANY WOMEN RECEIVED NEGATIVE MAMMOGRAM RESULTS. WHEN IN FACT THEY DID HAVE INVASIVE CANCER? THERE HAVE BEEN NO ADVERSE RESULTS SINCE THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT. DESPITE THE CONCERNS OF OPPONENTS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WOMEN HAVE NOT PANICKED AND HAVE PROVED THEY CAN HANDLE THIS INFORMATION QUITE WELL. A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT RESULTING FROM THE WIDESPREAD BREAST DENSITY LAWS ACROSS THE NATION IS THAT MEDICAL AND CANCER ORGANIZATIONS NOW REGARD DENSE BREAST TISSUE AS THE MOST PREVALENT AND COMMON RISK FACTOR. ECLIPSING EVEN FAMILY HISTORY. THIS MAKES THE CASE FOR PROVIDING WOMEN INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BREAST DENSITY EVEN MORE CRITICAL. TO GO BACKWARDS WOULD NOT ONLY BE A GREAT DISSERVICE BUT POTENTIALLY FATAL FOR SOME. WHEN CANCERS DETECTED EARLY IT IS MORE SURVIVABLE TREATMENT IS LESS BRUTAL AND IT IS LESS COSTLY? FIVE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR REALIZE THE VALUE OF DENSITY NOTIFICATION. CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST OF THE THIRTY FIVE STATES TO ENACT AND MANY OF THE STATES THAT FOLLOWED HAVE MODELED THEIR LAWS AFTER OUR OWN. I AM GRATEFUL THAT SENATOR MITCHELL AND THE CO AUTHORS UNDERSTAND AND CARE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BREAST DENSITY. AND I HOPE YOU WILL TO BY VOTING IN FAVOR OF SB. TEN THIRTY FOUR THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY IT IS INDEED AN HONOR. FOR ME TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT. I HAVE SENATE BILL. TEN THIRTY FOUR AS A PHYSICIAN SPECIALIZING IN EARLY DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER I AM SO GLAD TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW THE BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAW HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE HEALTH AND LIVES OF COUNTLESS WOMEN. IN MY OWN COMMUNITY. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND BE ON AS OTHER STATES LOOK TO US FOR GUIDANCE IN ENACTING SIMILAR LEGISLATION. SCREENING FOR BREAST CANCER HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. WOMEN FORTY AND ABOVE ARE RECOMMENDED TO HAVE ANNUAL MAMMOGRAMS HOWEVER. WOMEN ARE DIVERSE IN AGE RISK FACTORS AND TOLERANCE FOR SCREENING AND MAMMOGRAMS ARE NOT EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING BREAST CANCER IN ALL WOMEN. THERE'S AN ENORMOUS HAD ORIGINATED IN THE MAVERICK GRAPHIC APPEARANCE OF WOMEN'S BREAST TISSUE. DUE TO VARYING COMPONENTS OF FATTY TISSUE AND FIBROUS OR DANCE TISSUE. CANCER TISSUE CREATES A WIDER BACKGROUND WHICH MAY LIMIT HOW ABNORMALITIES WHICH MAY BE THE EARLIEST INDICATION OF CANCER. AND DENSE BREAST TISSUE ISCOMIN MAMMOGRAMS HAVE HETEROGENEOUS WE DANCE ARE EXTREMELY DENSE TISSUE WHICH IS ALSO NOW RECOGNIZED. AS A SIGNIFICANT INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS IN FACT ARE FOUR TO SIX TIMES. HIGHER RISK FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER SO HOW MIGHT A WOMAN KNOW SHE HAS DENSE BREAST TISSUE. WELL BEFORE BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAWS WERE ENACTED ACROSS UNITED STATES A WOMAN MIGHT ONLY FIND OUT AFTER DISCOVERING A CANCEROUS LUMP. WARREN ADVANCED BREAST CANCER DESPITE YEARS OF HAVING NORMAL MAMMOGRAMS. THIRTY FIVE STATES NOW HAVE ENACTED BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAWS. THE IMPACT OF THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN AN INCREASED AWARENESS ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF MAMMOGRAMS AND WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS. A MORE INFORMED DISCUSSION BETWEEN WOMEN AND THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ABOUT ADDITIONAL SCREENING OPTIONS. IN INCREASING UTILIZATION OF WHAT WE CALL SUPPLEMENTAL OR ADDITIONAL SCREENING WITH ULTRASOUND AND MRI AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. AN INCREASE IN BREAST CANCER DETECTION. AT THE CENTER WHERE I AM PRIVILEGED TO SERVE AS MEDICAL DIRECTOR THE ADDITIONAL THE ADDITION OF SUPPLEMENTAL SCREENING HAS INCREASED OUR EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER DETECTION RATE BY 10%. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS SINCE THE LAW WAS ENACTED. NINETEEN ADDITIONAL EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCERS WERE DETECTED IN OUR SCREENING PROGRAM LAST YEAR ALONE DUE TO SUPPLEMENTAL SCREENING AND WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS. SENATE BILL TEN THIRTY FOUR IS ESSENTIAL IN PROVIDING WOMEN AND THEIR HEALTH PROVIDERS WITH INVALUABLE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INDIVIDUALIZED INFORMED DECISION MAKING AND ANY CHEERING. OUR MUTUAL GOAL. EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER WHICH SAVES LIVES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. REMOTE CHáVEZ THERE'S IN SUPPORT. SIMONA HODAK MARTIN AS A WOMAN I'M IN SUPPORT -- MYCORRHIZA GAN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY THE SPONSOR THE BILL WANT TO THANK SENATOR MITCHELL. AND CONVEY THE THANKS OF FORMER SENATOR SUPERVISORS MAYBE AND FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. SECURING MEMBERS BOB ACT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL RADIOLOGISTS ARE THE ONES WHO PROVIDE THE SCREAM OUT FOR SERVICES PROVIDE THE NOTICE IN THE REPORT. WILL COME FOR THE LANGUAGE OF IN DOING THAT AND ARE NEUTRAL ANYONE ELSE. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW WE'RE BRINGING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- IV ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS. SENATOR. WITH A GREAT RESERVATION. OUR ANY IRRITATION YES. CRITICALLY THINKS NO OPPOSITION SHOWED UP. WITH A GREAT IRRITATION. THE MOTION IS A TO HAVE A MOTION WHERE MOTION BY A MISSILE MONA SECOND BY MISS KOREA MOTION IS PASSED AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY WOULD LIKE. TO CALL THE LEFT TO CLOSE IF I MAY BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY CERTAINLY -- IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE AMENDMENTS WERE NECESSARY -- FOR FOR BRADLEY REASONS FIRST IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR PROBABLY WOULDN'T SIGNED A BILL WITHOUT THE AMENDMENTS. I WOULD REPORT WERE REFER YOU ALL TO PAY SEVEN IN THE BILL ANNOUNCES. THAT QUOTE'S THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE ARE ON A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL. AND HE VETOED BECAUSE HE WAS CONCERNED THAT THAT LANGUAGE ADVISE THAT ADDITIONAL SCREENING MAY BE BENEFICIAL THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS FINALLY SETTLED -- AND FIFTEEN THIRTY EIGHT AND IS ON DUPLICATED AGAIN AND TEN THIRTY FOUR DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT SCREENING MAY BE BENEFICIAL. IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR JUST TO BRIEFLY READ WITH THE STATEMENT S. SO EVERYONE IS CLEAR ABOUT ALL WE ARE ASKING. STATEMENT READS YOUR MAMMOGRAM SHOWS THAT YOUR BREAST TISSUE IS DEATH. DENSE BREAST TISSUE WITH COMMON AND IS NOT ABNORMAL HOWEVER DENSE BREAST TISSUE CAN MAKE IT HARDER TO EVALUATE THE RESULTS OF YOUR MAMMOGRAM. AND MAY ALSO BE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER. THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESULT OF YOUR MAMMOGRAM IS GIVEN TO YOU TO RAISE YOUR AWARENESS. AND TO INFORM YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR DOCTOR TOGETHER YOU CAN DECIDE WHICH SCREEN OPTIONS ARE RIGHT FOR YOU A REPORT FOR YOUR RESULTS WITH SENT TO YOUR POSITION -- SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE REQUESTED -- A LIT REVIEW BE PERFORMED JUST THIS YEAR BY TWO BURKE. THE LIT REVIEW ASK QUESTIONS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE LANGUAGE IN OUR BILL. BUT ULTIMATELY ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS WAS. YOU BURKE CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF THE NOTIFICATION LAWS ON AWARENESS OF PERSONAL BRENT YESTERDAY DENSITY. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IS NOT QUOTE EVIDENCE OF NO EFFECT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IMPACT COULD RESULT FROM THESE LAWS BUT CURRENT EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO INFORM AN ESTIMATE. SO MY ARGUMENT IS SIMPLY THAT. WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES. AND WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING THAT WOMAN BE INFORMED SO WHEN THEY ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH THEIR HEALTH PROVIDER THERE ON EQUAL FOOTING AND COULD PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION -- THE SUNSET -- IF THE EXPECTATION ON THE SUNSET IS THAT THE RESEARCH MAY ULTIMATELY COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT FINALLY I DOUBT THAT EVERY WILL IT EVER WILL QUITE FRANKLY. BECAUSE FRANKLY WERE ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS BUT IF A WOMAN OR TEN THOUSAND WOMEN OR THREE WOMEN. ARE EMPOWERED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES. AND THEREFORE HAVE EQUAL FOOTING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THAT'S A GOOD THING. AND IF WE HAVE TO COME BACK AND SPEND TAXPAYER DOLLARS EVERY FIVE YEARS TO HAVE ANOTHER BILL TO EXTEND THE SUNSET I GUESS THATS WHAT WILL HAVE TO DO. SO WITHOUT AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE SENATOR. THAT WE WILL HAVE [inaudible] CALDERON [inaudible] WOULD. WHAT I MAYES? AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOUR CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE BONTA. BURKE [inaudible] BURKE I CARILLO. CARILLO AYE FLORA.

I AND NUMBER SIXTEEN THE SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY TWO MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY FACING OBESITY AND DIABETES CRISIS EFFECTIVE WHICH IMPACT THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND DRAIN THE RESOURCES OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. OBESITY RELATED MEDICAL EXPENDITURES COSTS THE STATE OVER NINE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR WITH TYPE TWO DIABETES ADDING AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. TO CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALIZATION COSTS OVERWHELMING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES ARE ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF THE INCREASE IN THESE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. SUGARY DRINKS PROVIDE NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND ARE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR OF ADDED CALORIES IN THE AMERICAN DIET. CALIFORNIAN DIETARY HABITS HAVE CHANGED GREATLY IN THE PAST FEW DECADES WITH MORE AND MORE OF OUR FOOD BUDGETS BEING SPENT ON FOOD PREPARED. OUTSIDE THE HOME. MOST MEALS OFFERED AND MARKETED TO CHILDREN IN RESTAURANTS INCLUDES SUGARY DRINK. WHICH OFTEN CONTAINS MORE THAN THE WEEKLY AMOUNT OF SUGAR RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN. MANY RESTAURANTS AND FAST FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS HOWEVER HAVE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS CHANGE WHAT BEVERAGES THEY OFFER IN THEIR KIDS MEALS. RESTAURANTS LIKE MCDONALDS JACK IN THE BOX APPLEBEE'S WENDY'S SUBWAY PINERA AND I HOP HAVE ALL VOLUNTARILY MADE EFFORTS TO OFFER MORE HEALTHFUL BEVERAGE OPSINS [inaudible] FOR CHILDREN. NUMEROUS LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAVE ALSO TAKEN STEPS TO IMPROVE NUTRITION STANDARDS FOR CHILDREN'S MEALS. LONG BEACH STOCKTON DAVIS DALY CITY SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN THE SITTING COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE ALL ADOPTED ORDINANCES WITHOUT OPPOSITION. THAT REQUIRE HELP FULL DRINK OPTIONS IN MEALS MARKETED TO CHILDREN. SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY TO FOLLOWS THE LEAD OF THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS AND IMPLEMENTS A STATEWIDE. HELPFUL DEFAULT BEVERAGE POLICY IN CALIFORNIA. SEPARATELY THIS BILL WILL MEAL PRIMARILY OFFERED FOR CONSUMPTION BY CHILDREN. TO MAKE THE DEFAULT DRINK OPTIONS SERVED IN THOSE BUNDLED MEALS A HELPFUL BEVERAGE SUCH AS WATER SPARKLING WATER FLAVORED WATER WITH NO ADDED SWEETENERS. OR UNFLAVORED MILK. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CUSTOMERS CAN STILL EXPLICITLY ASKED TO REPLACE THE HELPFUL DRINK WITH A SUGARY BEVERAGE IF THAT IS THEIR CHOICE. FALL BEVERAGE OFFERED IN A CHILDREN'S MEAL MUST BE THE HELPFUL HELPFUL OPTION. MEMBERS WORD A CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES LIKE THE ONE FOUND IN THIS BILL CAN HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT. AND EDUCATING PARENTS ABOUT THE SEVERE AND CHRONIC HEALTH IMPACTS THAT POOR NUTRITIONAL CHOICES HAVE ON OUR CHILDREN. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IN THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO PER PRESENT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PLEASE YOU THANK YOU.

SP TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT EMPOWERS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CDP H. TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY BY ENFORCING NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS AND FINING HOSPITALS THAT REPEATEDLY BREAK THE STANDARDS. DESPITE MANDATED A LONGSTANDING NURSED BREAK PATIENT RATIOS SOME HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO VIOLATE THESE VITAL REQUIREMENTS. FROM 200-082-2000 SEVENTEEN THERE WERE A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO ALLEGATIONS MADE SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO OUT OF REISSUED DIFFERENT DEFICIENCIES. REPORTED THE CDP H.. UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT'S CURRENT ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS SURVEYS EVERY THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THE HOSPITALS ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. HOWEVER THIS PERIODIC CHECK IS TOO FAR AN INFREQUENT ALLOWS HOSPITALS TO PREPARE FOR THE CD PH OFFICIALS TO CONDUCT THEIR SURVEY. S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCT UNANNOUNCED VISITS TO HOSPITALS TO INSPECT FOR COMPLIANCE. WITH NURSE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS THIS MEASURE WOULD ALSO ALSO EMPOWER THE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE THE STAFFING RATIOS. WITH FINES AND CASES WERE STAFFING RATIOS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED.

THREE NINETY FOUR THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. THE RATIOS ARE INTENDED TO KEEP OUR PATIENTS SAFE AND PRODUCED THE MOST OPTIMAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. HOWEVER THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM FOR TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED. CURRENTLY THE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING A RATIOS ARE NONEXISTENT [inaudible] IN FACT. MOST OF THE TIME WHEN A HOSPITAL IS FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS CD P. H. ADMINISTERS A STATEMENT OF DEFICIENCY. IN TURN HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO CREATE A PLAN OF CORRECTION THAT REMEDIES THE SPECIFIC SPECIFIED DEFICIENCY. SURPRISINGLY THERE IS NO LIMIT ON HOW MANY STATEMENT OF DEFICIENCIES A HOSPITAL CAN GET. AND MOST IF NOT ALL HOSPITALS ARE NEVER FIND. THAT IS WHY HOSPITAL'S ARE WILLING TO CONTINUOUSLY BREAK THE LAW INPUT PATIENT SAFETY AT RISK. AS A NURSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT VALUE TO COMPLY WOULD NURSE STAFFING RATIOS PUTS PATIENTS AT RISK ADDITIONALLY. THE NURSES HERE TODAY CAN ATTEST TO THE IMPORTANCE OF NURSE STAFFING RATIOS AND HOW TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE CATHY A RIVERSIDE ARE IN WHICH TELL YOU HOW A PATIENT DEVELOP SERIOUS SECONDARY ILLNESSES AS A DIRECT RESULT OF DANGEROUSLY LOW STAFFING LEVELS. IMAGINE IF THAT PATIENT WAS YOUR MOTHER YOUR FATHER YOUR WIFE THE HUSBAND ARGUE CHAU OR EVEN YOU. SEE A NEED CALIFORNIAN IS TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS BATTER. AND ENSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE WE'VE DONE A POOR JOB OF DOING THAT. S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT REQUIRES UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS AND FINDS HOSPITALS THAT REPEATEDLY. PLACE PATIENTS HEALTH AND SAFETY ADDRESS. THAT IS WHY S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT IS COSPONSORED BY. SEIU ONE TO ONE OR AND NEO NECK. THE MEASURE IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. THAT -- AMERICAN NURSES ASSOCIATION. CNA THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF CALIFORNIA. AS THE NURSES WE TOOK AN OATH TO PROTECT AND ADVOCATE FOR OUR PATIENTS. S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT IS SOUND POLICY OUTLINES WHAT OUR BOAT. ON BEHALF OF ALL THE NURSES AND AS SEE YEAH YOU WANT TO ONE ARE A AND AND THROW CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO PASS SP TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS WITH S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA -- AS HIGHLIGHTED BY SENATOR LEYVA I'M PRESIDENT PETITS CALIFORNIA HAS GONE TOO LONG WITHOUT A STRONG ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH NURSE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN C. P. H. IMPLEMENTED REGULATIONS ON ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES FOR A BROAD RANGE OF VIOLATIONS. INCLUDING VIOLATIONS OF THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. WHILE THESE REGULATIONS WERE INTENDED TO INCENTIVIZE HOSPITALS TO COMPLY WITH THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. DE THREE THESE REGULATIONS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. NOTABLY SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THE REGULATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES A VIOLATIONS OF TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS IN THE PAST DECADE. EVEN MORE NOTABLE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CITY PEACH STATED THAT IT DOES NOT ROUTINELY CONDUCT FOLLOW UP SURVEYS AFTER REQUIRING A PLAN OF CORRECTION TO CORRECTED EFFICIENCY. TO DETERMINE IF HOSPITALS ARE ACTUALLY COMPLYING WITH NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT CREATES A STRONG PROGRESSIVE FINE SCHEDULE FOR HOSPITALS THAT REPEATEDLY AND WILLFULLY VIOLATE THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. MOREOVER THE MEASURE WOULD ALLOW HOSPITALS TWO CHANCES TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS. BEFORE RECEIVING A MORE HEFTY FINE FOR THE THIRD VIOLATION. THE CONCEPT OF NURSE STAFFING RATIOS HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER FOUR DECADES AND IS ALLOWED HOSPITALS AMPLE TIME TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE RATIOS. AS DECIDED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND CURRENTLY UNDERSCORED IN ACADEMIC LITERATURE PROPER NURSE STAFFING SPECIFICALLY STAFFING ACCORDING TO THE RATIOS PRESCRIBED BY CPA EACH. LEADS TO BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES. AYE URGENT AYE VOTE ON S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT TO OUGHT TO NOT ONLY PROTECT OUR NURSES BUT ULTIMATELY TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. TO PRIORITIZE A PATIENT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY THANK YOU OTHERS THIS [inaudible] GROUP ERIC ROBLESS WITH UNITED NURSES ASSOCIATIONS OF CALIFORNIA PROUD SPONSOR UP. OF THE BILL WITHOUT AS CA YOU WANT TO ONE ARE AND YOU KNOW JUST OUT. REALLY QUICK GUIDE WEEK SPONSORED COUPLE BILLS ON THIS ALREADY IN THE PAST AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE PROBLEM HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED SO SAFE STAFFING CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM IN. ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS AND WE'RE HOPING NOW WE CAN RESOLVE THE ISSUE THANK YOU. MEMORIZATION PLEASE SIR FOX CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I BEEN VISE ROOM ARE REGISTERED NURSE WITH PROVIDENCE AND JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER AND BURBANK ON STRONG SUPPORT. STACY BERMAN BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON ROSANNA MENDEZ SEIU LOCAL ONE TWO WHEN IRAN REDERI REGISTERING SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF NURSES WHO HAD TO LEAVE EARLY TO CATCH A FLIGHT THANK YOU. DOUG SERVERS I MAY HAVE A CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND SPORTS THINK. MEDIA BORN REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES AND SUPPORT [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. YOU IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU COULD PICK. POLITICIAN CATHERINE'S GOVERNOR THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I'M WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND DEBBIE ROGER JUST -- THE HOSTELS ASSOCIATIONS HERE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS AND HOW WE SEE THE PROCESS -- MANAGES AND ADDRESSES PATIENT HARM A POTENTIAL PATIENT HARM CURRENTLY -- AND THEN I'LL BE HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS AFTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- MY NEEDS TO BE ROGERS ON REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE THIS BILL DOES A CUP. IN ESSENCE ARE ALREADY IN PLACE -- TOOK COVER -- THE HOSPITALS ARE PERIODICALLY -- SURVEYED THOUGH LAW REQUIRES EVERY THREE YEARS -- ALTHOUGH SURVEYS ARE ANNOUNCED AND IN FACT -- WIN BUT DEPARTMENT GOES IN FOR A COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION OR ANY SORT OF IN DESTINATION. IT'S ANNOUNCED AND AS HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT THERE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE -- PENALTIES -- FOR EVENTS THAT CAUSE PATIENT HARM. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE LICENSING SURVEY THAT HAPPENS EVERY THREE YEARS -- THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT'S -- MANUAL THAT THEY GIVE THEIR INSPECTORS OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO LOOK AT INSIDE THE HOSPITAL THIS ONE IS I DON'T KNOW BUT CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED PAGES. AND INCLUDES OF THE SURVEY PROCEDURES FOR THEIR STAFF TO LOOK AT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DO SUPPOSED TO DO ON THIS LICENSING SURVEY. IS LOOK FOR STAFFING RATIOS ON EVERY SINGLE UNIT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PICK ONE PATIENT ON EVERY UNIT -- OR OF ONE UNIT TO LOOK AT THE STAFFING RATIOS -- WHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM WHEN THIS HOSPITAL ISN'T COMPLIANT WITH SOMETHING THERE'S A DEFICIENCY THAT'S ISSUED THIS IS YOUR NON COMPLIANT WITH THIS IN THE HOSPITAL AS WAS STATED BEFORE IT DOES A PLAN CORRECTION? IF THAT DEFICIENCY REACHES A LEVEL WHERE A PATIENT HAS HARMED BECAUSE OF IT OR THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM. THAT'S WHERE THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY REGULATION I'M COMES INTO EFFECT AND HERE'S A LITTLE STAFFING UP A LITTLE. MIX OF HOW THEY LOOK AT THE COUNTIES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY LOOK AT IS THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF THE DEFICIENCY IS THIS A ONE TIME INCIDENT BECAUSE SOMEONE CALLED AND COOK SICK AND THEY COULDN'T GET STAFFING FOR THE DAY. OR IS THIS WHOLE WIDESPREAD -- EVENT THE US RELATIONS REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE FACTORS THAT RELATE TO THAT DEFICIENCY NOT JUST BEING OUT OF COMPLIANCE. DIDN'T HARM THE PATIENT TO THE HOSPITAL IDENTIFY IT IN ADVANCE IT'S A FILL FACILITY HAVE A HISTORY OF OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SORT OF VIOLATION. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT MECHANISMS IN PLACE THAT IF. A VIOLATION OF THE STAFFING RATIOS REACHES A LEVEL OF PATIENT HARM A POTENTIAL PATIENT HARM THAT THESE REGULATIONS WOULD KICK IN. ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. KELLY BUCKS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CARE DISTRICTS ALSO HEAR AN OPPOSITION'S FOR THE REASONS REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED ANYONE ELSE. SIR BUT DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP FORUM IS ALSO IN OPPOSITION. PRE BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IT'S RODRIGUEZ. I DON'T THINK THAT'S SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD SOMETHING -- THAT I CAN ATTEST TO THAT I'VE NOTICED IN MANY YEARS WORKING THEM AS INDUSTRY. BEING A MANY HOSPITALS AND PRIMARILY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WORKED OUT. STEPHAN IS ALSO A BIG ISSUE BACK THEN IT IS STILL IS NOW OFFICE I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS AT WORK IN THE AND THE CARE FOR A SPECIAL pTIME TO TIME THERE ARE ISSUES OUT THERE WHERE THERE. UNDERSTAFFED IN THE NOT ONLY BURDEN ON THEM WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THE WORKING BUT MOST APPOINTED THE CITY FOR THE PATIENT THAT THERE TO TAKE CARE OF HOW CAN THEY DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT BEING SUFFICIENTLY STAFF. FOR PATIENTS ANOTHER NURSES AND I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THAT THE MANUALS AND POLICIES THAT ARE GIVEN BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T FALL BY IT AND WE HAVE THESE ISSUES WERE -- WASHING SHORTAGE THERE WHETHER IT'S IN THE VIRTUAL UPON THE FLOOR BUT CAMERA TAKES A DIFFERENT SPORT IT'S GOOD BILL. IT'S WELL OVER DOOM ONLY SEE ONE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL. AND I NEED TO BE ADDED AS A QUANTUM. SO THAT HAD -- RIGHT THAT. PHILIP ENJOYS A DO [inaudible] ADDITION I AM CONCERNED -- NOT. THE CONTENTS OF THE BILL BUT BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO CONDUCT THESE AND TAKE -- EXACT OF EXAMINATIONS OR THE THE SITE VISITS ON A REGULAR BASIS THERE ARE BACKLOGS SO THE THE THE ASSERTION THAT THESE ARE HAPPENING EVERY THREE YEARS IS SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE. THERE BEHIND AND AND THAT IS THAT IS OF CONCERN. ALSO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE LACK OF FOLLOW UP WHICH AT WHICH I HAD WITH HIM WAS POINT UP BY ONE OF OUR WITNESSES HERE SO IT ISN'T TO ME IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT. IS THEIR HARM IS ABOUT ARE YOU FOLLOWING UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RULES ARE IN PLACE SO THERE ISN'T FUTURE HARM AND NOT JUST IT WAS DID HARM ACTUALLY OCCUR SO. IT'S APPRECIATE YOU BE BRINGING THEM GO FORWARD -- IT DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION IT'S DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS THERE'S A MOTION BY MISTER RODRIGUEZ A SECOND BY MISTER THURMOND WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE OFF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ACTUALLY YOU TOOK THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH I AM ALSO WORRIED ABOUT -- IT BEING OUT OF COMPLIANCE IF NO ONE WAS HARMED WILL WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE IS HARMED SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

WILL BE THAT OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON YOU HAVE YOUR SECOND BILL. TWELVE FORTY FIVE YES THANK YOU VERY GOOD. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS S. B. TWELVE FORTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW COVERED CALIFORNIA TO HAVE EMERGENCY RULE MAKING AUTHORITY FOR NEARLY ALL OF ITS REGULATORY PACKAGES. UNTIL JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THIS MEASURE WOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH TIME FOR THE PUBLIC TO REVIEW AND COMMENT. ON THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS AHEAD OF IT BEING ADOPTED BY THE COVERED CALIFORNIA EXECUTIVE BOARD. AS YOU MAY KNOW SINCE COVERED CALIFORNIA BEGAN OFFERING COVERAGE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THEY HAVE SERVED MORE THAN THREE MILLIO OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN COVER CALIFORNIA HAS MADE A DELIBERATE EFFORT TO MOVE TO PERMANENT REGULATIONS. AND HAS APPROVED FOR PERMANENT WILL MAKING PACKAGES. AS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT STABILIZED IT WAS EXPECTED THAT COVERED CALIFORNIA WOULD CONTINUE TO EFFECTIVELY TRANSITION. A PERMANENT RULE MAKING PROCESS HOWEVER CURRENT FEDERAL POLICY DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE ACA INDICATE THAT THERE WILL BE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE RULES GOVERNING HEALTH BENEFITS EXCHANGES. LIKE COVERED CALIFORNIA. DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FUTURE CHANGES TO THE ACA AND OTHER RELATED REGULATIONS COVERED CALIFORNIA MAY HAVE TO CREATE ADAPT REGULATIONS MORE QUICKLY. THAN IS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE PERMANENT RULE MAKING PROCESS WITHOUT THIS TIMELY AUTHORITY COVERED CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS COULD CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HARM ITS ABILITY TO PROPERLY SERVE. THEIR MORE THAN THREE MILLION CONSUMERS. IN ORDER TO PROMPTLY RESPOND TO CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS S. B. TWELVE FORTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW COVERED CALIFORNIA HAVE EMERGENCY RULE MAKING AUTHORITY. FOR NEARLY ALL OF ITS REGULATORY PRACTICES UNTIL JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AS MARY JUNE FLORENCE WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN WEARS MATCHING FLOORS WOULD HAVE ACCESS CALIFORNIA PLEASES SUPPORT THIS BILL. HELP ACCESS SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF OUR STATE'S HEALTH BENEFIT THAT CHANGE COVER CALIFORNIA AS AN INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ENTITY AND STATE ADMINISTERED MARKETPLACE IN. TWENTY TEN IT WAS THE FIRST A STATE RUN HEALTH THE INSURANCE EXCHANGE ESTABLISH AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA AND IS THE LARGEST EXCHANGE IN THE NATION. THE EARLY DAYS AND YEARS OF THE ACA NECESSITATED SUCH. AUTHORITY WHICH MADE COVERED CAL AND PROACTIVE IN CREATING THE RULES FOR A C. IMPLEMENTATION WHICH HEALTH ACCESS AS ALSO SUPPORTED. GIVEN FEDERAL UNCERTAINTY AND ONGOING FEDERAL ACTIONS THAT SABOTAGES OUR AC IMPLEMENTATION AND THREATENS OUR OVERALL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. COVER CALIFORNIA'S SIX SIXTIES EMERGENCY RULE MAKING AUTHORITY UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TO THE BILL PROVIDES A MINIMUM LEVEL OF PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT. WHICH ALLOWS FOR LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BY BOARD ACTIONS FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE'S A SUPPORT. KIMBERLY TEN I'M HAPPY CALIFORNIA PAN ETHICAL THAT WORK IN SUPPORT. GEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND SUPPORT AND I'LL JUST ADD SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS AND HOLDERS DISCOVERED LAST WEEK THAT WE ACTUALLY LIKE THIS PROCESS BETTER THAN THE FORMAL RULE MAKING -- IT'S BEEN WORKING AND THERE'S BEEN ROBUST -- STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AT THE BOARD MEETINGS WHEN THESE ARE FIRST PERSON [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE WILL BRING YOU BACK COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE OF TWO A QUESTION OF CHART. KIND OF A COMMON QUESTION. SO THEY WOULD STILL HAVE A PUBLIC MEETING. AND THEM FORWARD -- AND WE KNOW THATJUST FROM YOU KNOW EVEN OUR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY HE MEETINGS THAT WE HAD WE SEE HOW. INFLUX REALLY A LOT OF THIS ALONE HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW JUST COVERAGE FROM NOT ONLY THE FEDS BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO RESPOND OF THE STATE. IS CONSTANTLY. CHANGING ON IT WE AT THE ACA THEIR COVER CALIFORNIA REALLY HAS INFLUENCE OVER A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES IN THE STATE AND THE SOMETHING THAT'S HELPED US EXPAND COVERAGE. THE WAY THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD ON SO. NO I CAN SUPPORT THIS AND YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE NEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHRINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER ANYONE ELSE YES. A BIGELOW. MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GO ON WITHOUT BEING RECOGNIZED. ANOTHER ONE COMMENT THAT WAS JUST MADE THEIR TO AND FROM THE PUBLIC. TALKING ABOUT THIS PROCESS BEING VETERAN EASIER TO GET THROUGH MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS A PROCESS PUT IN PLACE WHILE CHALLENGING IT MAY BE. IS STILL WAS PUT IN PLACE FIRST VERY GOOD REASONS. MAYBE WE OUGHT A BE CAUTIOUS THAT WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES RUN AMOK. IT'S JUST TEMPERANCE HERE THAT I'M LOOKING AT I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY I THINK THE ONLY REASON I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK I KNOW THE ONLY REASON FOR THIS BILL IS BECAUSE OF THE FLUX IN -- AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT IS HAPPENING SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALL THE THREE MILLION WHO HAVE SIGNED UP -- I WOULDN'T SEE ANY REASON WHY WOULD GO BACK TO THE OLD PROGRAM IF ONCE WE KNOW THEIR CERTAINTY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT FOR RIGHT NOW WEEKS ONE TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIGNED UP IN WITH US AND WITH THE ON THREE CLUE THAT LANGUAGE AND THAT SORT. FOR THAT. TO OCCUR DEL I THINK THAT'S MY POINT THAT'S MY POINT EXACTLY RIGHT THERE. MAYBE WERE SOMETIMES QUICK TO REACT WHEN YOU REALLY DIDN'T NEED TO REACT. IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY JUMPING AND YELLING SNAKE WHEN THERE'S REALLY NO SNAKE. JUST A THOUGHT APPRECIATE THAT. YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE.

SO THAT HAS OF THIS CONSECUTIVAS -- THIRTEEN ZERO SENATORS DON'T THE FINAL BILL OF THE DAY IN VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT S. B.. TWELVE SIXTY FOUR WHICH WE PROVIDE BETTER CAL COVERAGE FOR HYPERTENSION MEDICATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED BY AN ADVANCED PRACTICE PHARMACIST. HYPERTENSION CONTROL THE UNITED STATES HAS HOVERED AT APPROXIMATELY 50% OVER THE PAST DECADE DESPITE THE DANGEROUS ROLE HYPERTENSION PLAYS AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE FIRST LINE. OF DEFENSE THE MEDICATIONS ARE FOR HYPERTENSION ARE. GENERIC AND AN EXPENSIVE. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFIT REVIEW PROGRAM STATED IN THE RECENT STUDY THAT THE MOST PREVALENT CONDITION AMONG NON DUAL MEDICAL AND RARELY RELEASE IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WAS HYPERTENSION A 27%. THE ANALYSIS ALSO STATED THERE'S A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE FROM FIVE STUDIES AT THE RECEIPT OF COMPREHENSIVE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER REDUCTIONS IN BLOOD PRESSURE THAT OF USUAL CARE. THIS INCLUDES ONE STUDY PUBLISHED THIS YEAR IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE DEMONSTRATE IN THAT PHARMACISTS MANAGING MEDICATIONS. IN LOS ANGELES BARBER SHOPS FOR PATRONS WITH UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION. ARE NEARLY SIX TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE IT ATTAINING BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. WITH HYPERTENSION BEING ONE OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND THEREBY THE GREATEST CORRECTABLE ATTRIBUTABLE RISK FOR DEATH WORLDWIDE. SP TWELVE SIXTY FOUR IS NEEDED TO HELP BRING DOWN BLOOD PRESSURE AND LOWER RATES OF DEADLY CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. S. B. TWELVE SIXTY FOUR WILL CREATE MORE ACCESS TO COMMUNITIES THAT CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE. HYPERTENSION MEDICATION MANAGEMENT READILY AVAILABLE. ADVANCED PRACTICE PHARMACISTS WILL BE FREE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FROM LOCAL PHARMACIES SO PATIENTS DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL TO A HOSPITAL OR DOCTOR'S OFFICES FREQUENTLY FOR HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT THAT'S MAKING. THE SERVICE EASIER TO OBTAIN AND MORE READILY AVAILABLE. ENGAGING PHARMACISTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION IS CRUCIAL TO ACHIEVING GOALS FOR UNCONTROLLED PATIENTS. COLLEAGUES I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCEDR STEPHEN CHEN ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR CLINICAL AFFAIRS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL OF PHARMACY AND DOCTOR RUN VICTOR DIRECTOR OF THE HYPERTENSION CENTER AT CEDAR SINAI HOSPITAL BURNS AND ALLEN CHAIR. IN CARDIOLOGY RESEARCH IMPRINTS PERSECUTOR OF THE TRIAL ON BARBARA BASS INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSION CONTROL IN AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN THE STUDY PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. S. B. TWELVE SIXTY FOUR HAS NO VOTES AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY IF I CAN INTRODUCED BY WITNESSES. SO I AM NOT STEVEN CHOI JUST TO CLARIFY I'M THE ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR CLERK AFFAIRS OF THE US YOU SCHOOL OF PHARMACY -- I'VE PROVIDED ARE DIRECTED OF THAT HARDNESS MAKES HIS MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS MOST RECENT TRANSITIONING FROM BEVERLY HILLS TO SKID ROW. SO WITH THE HEALTH DISPARITIES OR TALK ABOUT I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND AYE ANDERSON WHO TRAINS PHARMACISTS DO THIS KIND OF WORK MEDICATION MANAGEMENT SWEAT TO CLARIFY THREE POINTS. THE FIRST SAYS THIS BILL PROPOSES THAT ONLY DOCTORAL LEVEL PHARMACISTS WITH THE ADVANCED TRAINING AND EXPERTISE IN HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT ARE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. AND THEN BE PAID FOR THEM -- THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE CURRENTLY AND CALIFORNIA STATE LAW ALREADY SUPPORTS ALL OF THE SERVICES BEING DESCRIBED IN THIS BILL. AS A LAW DESCRIBES A MAKE HUGE MESS Y. PHARMACISTS IS NOT INDEPENDENT SERVICE IT'S A COLLABORATION BETWEEN PATIENT PHYSICIAN PHARMACIST UNDER A CLOUD WERE PRACTICES GOING OR PROTOCOL. THAT'S AUTHORIZED AND SIGNED BY PHYSICIANS BY MEDICAL GROUPS FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEM -- THIS IS. TWO THREE OF ITS AT THEIR CONSTANT COMMUNICATION IS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW -- THOUGH THERE'S NO FRAGMENTATION OF CARE THE CURLERS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AND I CAN SEE THAT WITH COMPAS BECAUSE MY THIRD POINT. IS THIS PRACTICE OF HAVING QUALIFIED PHARMACISTS MANAGE MEDICATIONS FOR CHRONIC DISEASES LIKE HYPERTENSION HAS BEEN IN EFFECT IN CALIFORNIA FOR FIVE DECADES IN THE VA HEALTH SYSTEM AND KAISER -- THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS BILLS PROPOSING MEDICAL PAYMENT FOR THE SERVICES TO ALLOW THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED MORE WIDELY A CENTER STONE HAS IS AS DESCRIBED IN NO PUBLIC PLACES LIKE BARBER SHOPS AND PHARMACIES. OUT WE RECENTLY COMPLETED A THREE YEAR GRANT FROM THE CENTER FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID INNOVATION IN RULING SIX THOUSAND LETS YOU KNOW MEDI CAL PATIENTS HYPERTENSION WAS ONE OF THE TOP CONDITIONS AND WE DEMONSTRATED THAT. HAVING PHARMACIST MANAGE HYPERTENSION [inaudible] CARE. I'M I TO TURN THIS OVER SNOUT WHO DUCKED AROUND VICTOR. WILL TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND VALUE OF THIS BILL SWAN ALSO CLARIFY THAT DOCTOR VICTOR HAS WRITTEN THE BOOK ON HYPERTENSION HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE HYPERTENSION TEXTBOOK. THAT THE MEDICAL WORLD READS TO LEARN ABOUT HYPERTENSION AND THE AUTHORS THE CHAPTERS I CARDIOLOGISTS READ TO LEARN ABOUT MANAGING HYPERTENSION AFTER [inaudible] STEVE. SO HYPERTENSION HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. BECAUSE HIS HALF OF ALL HEART ATTACKS. THREE QUARTERS OF ALL STROKES [inaudible] I'M. WE WE HAVE WE CAN'T CURE MOST CASES OF HYPERTENSION BUT WE CAN CONTROL MOST OF THEM. WITH REALLY EXCELLENT MEDICATIONS THERE NOW GENERIC AND LOW COST. AND BUT IN THE REAL WORLD. ON ITS HERE TO STONE POINTED OUT I'D MAJORITY OF OF FOLKS EFFECTIVE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. DON'T ACHIEVE A SAFE BLOOD PRESSURE LEVEL TODAY. SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM MULLIN PART DOCTORS YOU'RE SO BUSY GETTING PRESSURED TO SEE MORE AND MORE PATIENTS. THE TIME THAT DOCTOR PATIENT VISIT IS IS WAY TOO SHORT AND WE'D LIKE. AND CONDITION PENSIONS CAN PUSH BACK AND SOMETIMES I DON'T COMPLY WITH ALL BE ALL THE AS PRESCRIBED. THERE HAVE BEEN -- OVER FORTY TRIALS AND HELP PUBLISHED THEY PROVIDE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE. AND THAT THE BEST WAY TO CONTROL HYPERTENSION IN PRACTICE IS WITH THE PHARMACIST PHYSICIAN TEAM APPROACH TO HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT. NOW IN MY OWN STUDY WHICH IS RECENTLY PUBLISHED. ITEM DOCTORATE LEVEL PHARMACISTS MADE HOUSE CALLS TO AFRICAN AMERICAN OWNED BARBERSHOPS. SO THERE THEY MET THE THE PATRONS ITEM THEY WERE THEY I RECONCILED THE MEDICATIONS THAT MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE. I THINK CHECK LABORATORY RESULTS RIGHT THERE IN THE BARBER SHOP. AND THEY PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS UNDER COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENT. WITH EACH GENTLEMAN'S OWN AYE PHYSICIAN. AND THEN WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AYE THEY STE THEY SENT PROGRESS NOTE. I TO THE TREATING TO THAT -- SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN WHO COULD [inaudible] COLLABORATION. AB ALMOST ALL THE TIME IS REALLY SUPERB. NOW MY STUDY AS WELL AS MOST OF THESE OTHER FORTY STUDIES WERE FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. SO PROBABLY HUNDREDS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN RESEARCH DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT TO PROVIDE THIS EVIDENCE. IN MY OPINION THIS BILL. AND WOULD BE A HUGE STEP FORWARD -- IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN IN IN REAL PRACTICE [inaudible] I'M SO. I'M ENCLOSING AND ONE THIRD OF OUR TRIAL PETITION PARTICIPANTS WHERE I'M MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. I AM AND IT TWELVE MONTHS AND THE PHARMACIST LED PROGRAM HAD NO EFFECT ON THE FREQUENCY OF DOCTOR VISITS. SO WAS IS THAT WERE TAKING BUSINESS AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS. AND THERE WAS 64% OF THE MEN IN OUR TRIAL IT SIX MONTHS ACHIEVED. I'M SAFE BLOOD PRESSURES WITH WHITE PERSIAN THE ONE TWENTIES EVERY SEVENTIES. I COMPARED 212% OF MEN WHO REFERRED BACK TO THE PRACTICING DOCTORS. SO CLOSING I THINK THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT NEEDLESS HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES. IN SAVE LIVES AMONGST THAT THOSE VULNERABLE AMONG US IN OUR POPULATIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION [inaudible] A MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE GLORIA AND THE MARTINI WITH A CALIFORNIA CITING HEALTH SYSTEM PHARMACISTS SPONSOR AND SUPPORT. DAN DAWN AS A PHARMACIST AND ALSO AS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY HEALTH SYSTEM PHARMACISTS. MICHAEL TO WITH THEIR PROBLEMS ST JOSEPH HEALTH SYSTEM IN SUPPORT -- DAVID GONZALEZ WITH AMERICA'S PHYSICIAN GROUPS ALSO IN SUPPORT WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT ANOTHER BILL AUTHORED BY THE CHAIR LITTLE MORE COMPREHENSIVE THIS IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON SHIPMENTS WITH GROWING IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION IN SUPPORT. SHARIF US WITH CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION MR MEMBERS TIBETAN REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY I MEAN WE ARE OPPOSED S. B.. TWELVE SIXTY FOUR I'M BEFORE IT TURNED OVER TO MY WITNESS -- DOCTOR NORMAN THE POORER CARDIOLOGISTS AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF OUR ORGANIZATION. JUST WANT TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT ON AND IF YOU THE REMARKS -- THE CENTER MENTION THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO ADVANCE PRACTICE PHARMACISTS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT CORRECT. THE WITNESSES ALSO MENTIONED THAT IT ONLY APPLIES TO A PHARMACIST WITH ADVANCED DOCTORAL DEGREE THAT'S ALSO INCORRECT. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BILL SPECIFICALLY ON PAGE. TWO LINES. THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE TWO CODE SECTIONS THAT IT REFERS TO ARE JUST FOR A PHARMACIST SO THIS COULD BE A PHARMACIST TO GRADUATE FROM SCHOOL AND IS NOW ELIGIBLE TO PRY THE SERVICES. AND LINES. THIRTY SIX TO THIRTY EIGHT IT IS SPECIFIC TO ADVANCE PAST PRACTICE FARCES SO THE SENATOR IS CORRECT IT DOES APPLY TO THEM. BUT IT IS -- APPLE TO A BROADER GROUP OF FARMS IS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ADVANCED LEVEL OF TRAINING EDUCATION THAT IN ADVANCE PRACTICE FARMS DOES SO WITH THAT PRESET ELECTED TURN IT OVER TO DOCTOR THE POOR. TO GO MUCH MORE DETAILS ON SUMMER CONCERT VERY MUCH. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO PRESENT OUR VIEWS OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS HISTORICALLY THE PURPOSES BILL WAS REALLY TO PROVIDE IMPROVED ACCESS -- TO MEDICAL CARE TO THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED -- I'M NOT AN EXPERT AT THE ENGLISH SHE'S THAT THESE BILLS ARE -- WRITTEN AND HOWEVER I REALLY AM HARD PRESSED TO FIND REALLY HOW -- THIS SEEMS TO BE -- THE CASE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE EXCELLENT WORK UP PRESENTED. REALLY CREATES A CLOSED LOOP. EFFICIENT MODEL WITHIN A CLOSELY WATCHED CLINICAL PROTOCOL. WHERE THERE IS? CONTINUOUS COLLABORATION WITH PHYSICIANS THERE'S CONTINUOUS COLLABORATION IN TERMS OF THE MOVEMENT OF INFORMATION. AND I THINK THAT THAT HOWEVER IS NOT NECESSARILY HOW THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO RUN WITH THIS LEGISLATION. THERE REALLY ARE NO CAB YACHTS. THE WITHOUT REGARD TO EDUCATION EVEN FURNISHING TRAVEL MEDICINE FALLS PROTOCOLS FURNISHING THE LOCKS SOUND. HAS PARTICULAR PROTOCOLS ADMINISTRATION HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES IN CONSULTATION WITH THE AMERICAN CONGRESS OF OBGYN IMMUNIZATIONS REALLY -- FOLLOW PROTOCOL FROM THE CBC YET HOWEVER THERE REALLY ARE NO PROTOCOLS THERE'S NO CERTIFICATION AND THERE IS NO TRAINING. AND BLOOD PRESSURE IS MUCH MORE THAN A NUMBER. THIS IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PAGES. OF THE GUIDELINES FOR THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY AND AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION LIKE THE PAST THIS PERHAPS AROUND TO THE ARE LEGISLATORS HERE. IT REALLY GOES TO SHOW REALLY THE COMPLEXITY WITH WHICH HYPERTENS CAMP CAN BE -- EFFECT THAT AND MY CONCERN IS THAT THE TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION UNDER THE PROPOSED DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE EFFICIENT COLLABORATION THE MOVEMENT OF INFORMATION FROM THE PHARMACY TO MY OFFICE. I'M OUT THIS PATIENT IS NOW GOING TO BE TREATED IN A VERY DISJOINTED WAY BY THE PHARMACIST BY THE INTERNET BY THE CARDIOLOGISTS UNLESS THERE REALLY IS EFFORTS TO ENHANCE THE LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION AGAIN. MY CONCERN IS THE LACK OF TRAINING THE LACK OF CERTIFICATION IN TERMS OF THIS PROCESS ALSO I'M A BIT CONCERNED PARTICULARLY IF THERE'S BETH PHARMACISTS ARE GOING TO BE WORKING IN. IN -- IN THERE RETAIL FAR LEARN ABOUT THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST RIGHT NOW WE WE REALLY HAVE ISSUES IN TERMS OF WHAT I PRESCRIBE IN TERMS OF THE MEDICATION. AND WHAT THE PATIENT ULTIMATELY IS PRESCRIBED IT'S EITHER DONE BY VIRTUE OF DEALS THAT ARE MADE WITH THE WITH THE PHARMACY OR THE PBM. OR WHAT HAVE YOU BUT I'M ALREADY HAVING ISSUES AND PATIENTS ALREADY VERY CONFUSED I GET MY PRESCRIPTION FOR MEDICATION. DELETE WITH WHAT WITH A AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE. AND I THINK THAT AND I THINK THE SECONDARY ISSUES OR THE TERTIARY ISSUE RELATES THE REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES BELIEVE ME I PRACTICES BUSY ENOUGH I STILL MAKE SURE I TAKE. PLENTY GOOD CARE PATIENTS HYPERTENSION IS A PREVALENT DISEASE AND ONE WITH WHICH WE NEED TO A TAKE CARE CAREFULLY BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW THE WRITING OF THIS BILL -- REALLY LEADS TO ENHANCEMENT OF CARE IN TERMS OF OF POPULATIONS ARE NOT WELL SERVED AS WELL AS THE NECESSARY TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION AS WELL AS THE COMMUNICATION THAT'S NECESSARY. THAT YOU DID SEE IN DR VIKTORS WORK WHICH ACTUALLY COULD BE A MODEL FOR HOW WE DO THIS BUT I'M FEEL THAT VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT MODEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF YOU VERY MUCH -- ARE THERE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. JERRY HEX REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS WE ARE OPPOSED MONTHS AMENDED. JUST ASKING FOR THIS TO BE LIMITED TO ADVANCED PRACTICE PHARMACISTS WITH TRAINING AND HYPERTENSION [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COMMENTS -- WE WERE MODES. I HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER BERMAN. THE SECOND BY [inaudible] THREE PEOPLE. BERMAN THIS BERKUS WAVING HER HAND FRANTICALLY SO WILL GIVE THAT TO HER -- PERSONAL THAT WERE THANK YOU -- SENATOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD -- I BELIEVE THE GOALS A COMPREHENSIVE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT WHICH IS TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. AND REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I CARRIED AB TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE PROVIDED MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR COMPREHENSIVE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. I'M UP I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY -- BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ACTUALLY TOO NARROW. I BELIEVE -- DE AS IT ONLY APPLIES TO HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT -- MEDICATION MANAGEMENT AND IS BENEFITS TO RURAL AREAS LIKE MY DISTRICT IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT -- AND HOW MANY COMMUNITY PHARMACISTS WOULD ACTUALLY PERFORM THE SERVICES AS THE BILL IS WRITTEN OTHER PROVISIONS -- MOSTLY APPLIED TO HEALTH FACILITIES WHICH WOULD HOSPITALS NOT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS WHICH IS WHERE 50% OF MY PATIENTS GET THEIR CARE -- THERE NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED DISCUSSION ON THE LONG TERM VISION FOR COMPREHENSIVE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT I'D I'D I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I CAN ALSO -- RESPECTFULLY RESPONDED THE OPPOSITION CERTAINLY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE THEM -- STEPPING FORWARD -- THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND I HAVE MY OF WITNESSES CONFIRM HIS THAT. THE ENTRY LEVEL DEGREE IS A FARM DE TO CREATE DOCTOR PHARMACY DEGREE. AND IS REQUIRED TO GET INTO AN ADVANCED PRACTICE -- PROGRAM THAT IS CERTIFIED OUGHT TO HAVE THOSE QUALIFICATIONS AND YOU CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM UNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATELY CERTIFIED AS AN ADVANCED PRACTICE PHARMACIST. IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. NOW THIS DOESN'T MEAN THE PHARMACISTS ARE GOING TO BE PUTTING UP A SHINGLE. AND OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY AS THE OPPOSITION WOULD LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THIS IS A COLLABORATION. I COLOR THE TRIAD THE PATIENT THE PHYSICIAN. AND THE PHARMACIST WORKING TOGETHER IS NOT A MANDATE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. IF PHYSICIAN GROUPS TO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS. THAT THEY HAVE THAT OPTION NOT TO PARTICIPATE BUT I THINK THAT MANY PHYSICIAN GROUPS WILL BE ARE ENCOURAGED TO HAVE THIS. COLLABORATION IN THE BEST INTEREST OF MAINTAINING SOMEBODY WITH A HEALTHY BLOOD PRESSURE AND WHEN THE MEDICAID MEDICATIONS ARE ARE NOT WORKING OR THERE HAVE SIDE EFFECTS. THE PHARMACIST WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE PHYSICIAN TO COME UP WITH. ALTERNATIVES IT'S NOT DONE IN A VACUUM IT'S ALL DONE TOGETHER AND I LIKE MY COLLEAGUES TO ELABORATE IF I IF I ME. SO OUR ART CHILD DEADLOCKED WILL POUR. WASTE AND DONE UNDER THE CURRENT SCOPE OF PRACTICE DEVOID OF CLINICAL PHARMACIST. SO SO EVERYTHING THAT WE FOLLOWED WITH TENDER COURSE UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE PHARMACY LA. I CAN CITIES THIS ONLY APPLIES TO FARM DIS THEIR DOCTORATE LEVEL PHARMACY S. THAT'S THAT'S FOR SURE.

INTAKE INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE PAGES WITH BOB DOWN TO ONE PAGE WITH BIG FONT. WITH THE KEY ISSUE IN IN TREATING HYPERTENSION WHICH WE WE PUBLISHED ONLINE [inaudible] AND AND SO IT IS IT'S IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT. AND IS LONG AS IT'S IS A GREAT POINT OUT BETWEEN. AYE THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN AND THE PHARMACIST THINGS WILL WORK GREAT AND WE WERE VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT THE THAT THE PHARMACIST OUR CASE IN THE IN THE PHYSICIAN'S. WE'RE NOT IN THE UNDER THE SAME ITEM BUILDING THEY WERE EMPLOYED BY THE SAME PEOPLE. I'M AND THE POSITIONS I WORK WERE EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH HOW IT TOOK WORK LOAD OFF OF THEM. IF WE EVER GET TO VALUE BASED. I TREATMENT WHERE YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU HAVE TO GET PATIENTS BLOOD PRESSURES IN CLASS ROLES IN OTHER IN. A ONE SEES TO GO ALL THIS WILL BE A GREAT BAND PHYSICIAN.
