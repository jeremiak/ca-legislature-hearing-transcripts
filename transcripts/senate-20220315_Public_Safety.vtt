THIS TIME. GREAT NOW WILL BRING

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.342

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:18.477
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS RELATES

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:20.779
TO AS THREE EIGHT EIGHT TWO.

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:22.614
SENATOR TOM WATER. OF THANK YOU

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:25.117
MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:26.685
THINK- SENATOR EGGMAN FOR

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.687
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD SHE

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:30.622
AND I HAD TALKED ABOUT IT

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:34.126
YESTERDAY- AND I. WOULD-

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:36.562
ACTUALLY LIKE TO BE- ADDED ON AS

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:38.997
A CO AUTHOR BECAUSE I THINK.

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.133
ELEVATING THE ISSUES OF THE ACT

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.403
I D. D. COMMUNITY- IS INCREDIBLY

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.339
IMPORTANT. I ALSO WANT TO ECHO

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:49.174
SOME OF THE COMMON SHARED BY THE

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:53.746
ADVOCATE FROM DRC- YOU KNOW AND-MY HOPE IS THAT AS THIS BILL

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:55.714
CONTINUES TO MOVE THROUGH THE

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:57.416
PROCESS. THAT THE ROLE OF THE

00:16:57.483 --> 00:16:58.450
COUNCIL IS NOT TO FOCUS

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.219
PRIMARILY ON TRAINING AND THE

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:02.554
REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:03.655
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT THAT

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:06.091
HAPPENED LAST YEAR. IN L. A.

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:08.627
COUNTY WHERE A YOUNG MAN. WITH

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:13.499
SCOLIOSIS WHO IS AUTISTIC- AND

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:17.069
DEAF PARTIALLY- WAS ESSENTIALLY

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:19.772
SHOT BY A DEPUTY FROM THE

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.440
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THAT THE

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:22.741
DEPARTMENT HAD ALREADY GONE

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:24.209
THROUGH A SERIES OF TRAINING

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:26.745
PROGRAMS AND IN FACT DURING THE

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:28.313
COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION IT

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.182
WAS REVEALED THAT I THINK WITHIN

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:31.917
A YEAR OF THAT HAPPENING ARE

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.119
PRIOR TO THAT HAPPENING. EVEN

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:36.488
THE DEPUTIES INVOLVED HAD GONE

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:38.457
THROUGH THE TRAINING PROCESS AND

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:40.559
HAD BEEN WORKING WITH DISABILITY

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:43.529
GROUPS AND SO IT SHOWS THAT THE

00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:46.031
ISSUE ISN'T THE REMEDY IS AND

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:47.866
ALSO ALWAYS TRAINING. BUT IT IS

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:52.171
HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT SEE THE IDT

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:54.706
COMMUNITIES MAYBE HOW THEY ARE

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:56.975
WORKING MORE AGGRESSIVELY WITH

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:59.144
ADVOCATES FROM THAT PARTICULAR

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:04.450
SPACE- TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY-

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:08.287
BEHAVIORS OR TRAITS OR TRIGGERS

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:09.955
EXCEPT AROUND BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:11.890
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:13.792
WE'RE DEALING WITH A POPULATION

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:16.895
THAT MAY HAVE UNREGULATED-

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:19.865
BODIES AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.034
SUGGEST THAT AS A RESULT BAD

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.769
THINGS SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM SO

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:25.537
MY HOPE IS THAT SOMEHOW DURING

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:27.773
THE COURSE OF THIS- PROCESS THAT

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.641
SOME OF THAT CAN BE INCLUDED AND

00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:33.011
THEN- MAYBE ALSO. THE TO

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:35.781
CONSIDER FOR THAT COUNCIL

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:38.217
MEMBERSHIP YOU KNOW IF ADVOCATES

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:39.685
COULD ALSO INCLUDE THOSE WHO

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:42.187
HAVE REPRESENTED VICTIMS OR

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:44.723
SURVIVORS. OF PARTICULAR

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.892
INCIDENTS THAT COME FROM THE IDT

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.094
COMMUNITY BECAUSE I THINK THOSE

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.697
FOLKS ACTUALLY HAVE A BIRD'S-EYE

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:53.665
VIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING FROM

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:56.268
BOTH SIDES AND CAN MAYBE HELP IN

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:58.070
SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT

00:18:58.136 --> 00:19:00.472
WE'RE TRYING TO- REVEAL FROM THE

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:01.440
COUNCIL SO THAT WE CAN SEE

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:03.442
BETTER OUTCOMES. BUT THANK YOU

FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD-

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:07.813
BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE IN A

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.480

LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK THAT'S

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:32.070
ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.405

TRAINING WE CAN NEVER HAVE

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.015
ENOUGH TRAINING IN A WEEK WE CAN

EDUCATION- IN THE MEDICAL FIELD

PARTS AROUND IMPROVING OUTCOMES

PILOTING TRYING DIFFERENT

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:20.512
APPROACHES WHERE WE WOULD SEND

SOMETHING OTHER THAN LAW

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:23.348
ENFORCEMENT BUT THAT'S NOT

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:25.917

HAVE THE STAFFING CAPABILITIES

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:30.322

UNTIL WE HAVE THAT COMPLETELY

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:34.259
RESOLVED THEN THIS IS A VERY

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.294
IMPORTANT STEP. BUT I WOULD I DO

THEM TO BRING US RECOMMENDATIONS

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:47.973

SINCE WE KNOW. THAT THE END

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:59.051
YOURS AUTHOR STATEMENT ALSO THAT

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.153
WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:02.554
AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES ARE

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.490
MORE LIKELY TO UNFORTUNATELY-

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:08.260
EXPERIENCE- IF VIOLENCE OR EVEN

00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:10.128
DEATH. WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:12.664
LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT WE ALSO

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:15.367
THIS OCCURS. IN OUR JAILS IN OUR

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.869
CUSTODIAL SETTINGS WHEN WE LOOK

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:20.005
AT WHO DIES IN JAIL CUSTODY OR

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:21.640
EVEN IN PRISON CUSTODY OFTEN.

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:25.977
IT'S A VERY- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT.

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:26.912
UNCOMMON FOR THAT PERSON TO

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:29.181
HAVE. THE THESE KIND OF

00:22:29.247 --> 00:22:31.750
DISABILITIES THAT ARE EITHER

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:33.952
INTERPRETED BY. YOU KNOW THERE

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.754
CONSTRUED OFFICER IS BEING JUST

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:38.256
LIKE- DEFIANT BEHAVIOR SOMETHING

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:41.193
VERSUS THE ACTUAL WEATHER IF THE

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:42.961
PERSON'S ARTISTIC OR WHO KNOWS

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:44.529
ON WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:45.997
DISABILITY IS THAT IT IS JUST

00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:48.467
THEIR BEHAVIOR THERE IS NOT

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:49.701
ANYTHING THEY CAN CONTROL ABOUT

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:52.871
THAT. AND SO- WE OBVIOUSLY WE

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:54.206
DON'T WANT PEOPLE PEOPLE SHOULD

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:55.907
NOT HAVE TO BE IN THAT SITUATION

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:57.309

THAT IT- THAT THE BILL HAS MORE

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:14.926
THAN JUST THE TRAINING AND I

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:16.361
HOPE THAT THAT ASPECT OF IT CAN

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:19.131
BE ENHANCED AS IT MOVES THROUGH

00:23:19.197 --> 00:23:21.066

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.907

AND IT HAD- THIS BILL IS NARROW

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:02.747
IN THAT IT JUST BECAUSE PROVIDES

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:04.482
THIS CARD BUT THE QUESTION I

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:07.285
HAVE FOR THE AUTHOR IN PERHAPS

FOR YOUR LEAD WITNESS IT IS.

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:10.922
WHETHER IN IN MAYBE HAS TO BE

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:13.591
DONE IN ANOTHER BILL BUT WHETHER

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:15.727
WE NEED. TO ADD A FURTHER

00:33:15.793 --> 00:33:17.595
PROTECTION TO OUR SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:19.964
SURVIVORS. BECAUSE IT IS COME

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:23.434
OUT NOW THAT WE HAVE HAD AT

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:26.471
LEAST ONE- PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:28.373
NOT PROSECUTOR WAS PUT AT LAW

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:31.142
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. THAT TOOK

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:33.611
THE DNA OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:35.213
SURVIVORS IN OTHER WORDS TOOK

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:38.349
TOOK THE EVIDENCE FROM THE RAPE

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:40.618
KIT. AND PLACES WHERE I WOULD

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:42.420
NEVER SAY THAT BECAUSE I HATE

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:44.188
THAT TERM BUT WHATEVER TOOK THAT

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:47.892
EVIDENCE. ARENDT PUT IT THROUGH

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:50.094
THE SAME DATABASE TO SEE WHETHER

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:53.965
THAT PERSON HAD. IT WAS

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:56.000
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRIME AND OF

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:59.804
COURSE RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT.

00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.774
THE REPORTING RATES FOR SEXUAL

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.542
IF YOU WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:06.978
THE VERY IDEA THE VERY ACT OF

00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:08.846
GOING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:11.482
ALREADY SUCH A LOW PERCENT. THAT

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:14.051
WE DO NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:16.053
THAT THAT MINIMIZES OR LESSONS

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.722
OR HAS THE CHILLING EFFECT ON

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:20.591
PEOPLE TO REPORT THEIR ASSAULT.

00:34:20.658 --> 00:34:23.628
AND SO NOW WE WITH THIS WE'RE

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:24.996
TRYING TO ASSIST THOSE

00:34:25.062 --> 00:34:29.067
SURVIVORS. BUT DO WE NEED ALSO

00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:31.068
TO ENSURE THAT THERE THE

00:34:31.135 --> 00:34:32.970
EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE SUBMITTED

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:34.205
WILL THEN NOT BE USED AGAINST

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:37.175
THEM. SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF

00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:39.243
EITHER THE AUTHOR OR THE- EARLY

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.712
PROPONENT WANTS TO ADDRESS THAT

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:43.080
THANK YOU CENTERS CAN I AM WELL

00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:45.082
AWARE OF THE CASE IN WHICH

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:46.751
YOU'RE TALKING BUT I DO THINK

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:48.152
THAT DETAIL MALLEY WOULD BE

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.787
BETTER FIRST AND PROBABLY ANSWER

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:50.688
YOUR QUESTION BETTER. DO MALLEY

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:53.391
ARE YOU STILL THERE. I AM YES

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:56.561
THANK YOU THANK YOU. D. SAID THE

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:58.262
OCCURRENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:34:58.329 --> 00:34:59.430
SAN FRANCISCO WITH THEIR CRIME

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:02.333
LAB IS. OUTRAGEOUS AND I BELIEVE

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.302
IT'S AN ANOMALY TO HOW. THE

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:07.305
CRIME LABS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE.

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:10.241
BEEN PROCESSING. IT IT'S VERY

00:35:10.308 --> 00:35:11.976
CLEAR AND I'VE CONFIRM THIS WITH

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:14.245
SEVERAL OF THEM AND A MAJORITY

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:17.682
OF THE- DNA. ANALYSIS IS BEING

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:19.016
DONE BY OUR CALIFORNIA

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.718
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THERE THE

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:23.921
CRIME LAB FOR FORTY EIGHT OF THE

00:35:23.988 --> 00:35:26.491
COUNTIES- INTO THEIR VERY FEW

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:28.259
CAPS THAT ARE. I THINK IN THEIR

00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:32.730
OWN COUNTY IN MY COUNTY SO THE-

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:34.699
B. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:35.833
LANGUAGE WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.236
LIKE BECAUSE- IT'S AN ANOMALY

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:39.770
THAT HAPPENED AND OTHER CRIME

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:41.239
LABS ARE NOT KEEPING THE

00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:43.341
SEPARATE DATABASES THAT CONTAIN

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:46.410
THE VICTIM SURVIVORS DNA OR ANY

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:49.413
OTHER. BIOLOGICAL REFERENCE OF

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.183
THE VICTIM. AND SO I YOU KNOW

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.185
AGAIN I THINK THAT IT'S EVEN

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:56.621
TAKE TO WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN

00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:57.655
FRANCISCO THEY HAVE DECLARED

00:35:57.722 --> 00:35:58.456
THAT THEY ARE CORRECTING

00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:00.558
WHATEVER THE- SITUATIONS THAT

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:03.794
THEY CREATED- AND- IF THERE IS

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:04.896
SOME DISCUSSION POINT ABOUT

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:06.531
TRYING TO COME UP WITH FASHION

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:10.134
SOME LANGUAGE I'M VERY HAPPY TO

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:10.935
BE INVOLVED WITH THAT. WELL IN

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:13.104
PERHAPS IT IS ONE OF THOSE

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.071
THINGS WE HAVE WE WOULD HAVE TO

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:16.040
DO SEPARATELY BUT WHILE IT MAY

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:17.375
BE UNIQUE AND AN ANOMALY IT

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:19.377
HAPPENED. IT WAS HIGH PROFILED

00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:22.179
AND SO IT. IT I CAN'T HELP BUT

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:24.215
KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE A

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:26.384
FURTHER CHILLING EFFECT. ON

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.785
PEOPLE WHO ARE SEXUALLY

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:29.954
ASSAULTED FROM REPORTING. THEIR

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.123
ASSAULT I AM VERY UNFORTUNATELY

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:37.061
WE KNOW. THAT- SEVEN FOLDABLE

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:39.163
PEOPLE BACK WHETHER THEY'RE ON

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:44.268
HOW STE. WHETHER ANY NINE HAVE

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:46.604
ADDICTS UNITS ARE MORE. LIKELY

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:47.872
TO WIN MAYBE NOT MORE LIKELY BUT

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.206
THEY ARE PRONE TO BEING SEXUALLY

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:51.242
ASSAULTED BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:54.345
ARE. MORE VULNERABLE THEY HAVE

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:57.481
LESS- JUST LESS SAFEGUARDS AND

00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:59.617
PROTECTIONS WHETHER BECAUSE THEY

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.018
LIVE ON THE STREET OR BECAUSE

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:03.721
THEY ARE IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:06.524
AND YET THERE ARE SALTY'S

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:14.699
JUSTICE CRIMINALS ANYBODY.

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:15.333
ELSE'S AND WE NEED EVERYBODY TO

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:17.201
REPORT. SO IN WE MAY NEED FIX

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:18.903
THAT WHILE ICE THIS BILL AS

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.004
IMPORTANT TO HELP SUPPORT. OUR

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:21.205
SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:23.040
TO GIVE THEM YOU KNOW FURTHER

00:37:23.107 --> 00:37:26.677
INTO AN- MMHM AGENCY TO ACT ON

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:27.878
THEIR BEHALF I ALSO WANT TO

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:30.214
ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT. IN OTHER

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:33.784
WAYS CREATING A CHILLING EFFECT

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:35.586
SO- BUT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL.

WILL BE HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE

WE- THAT'LL EXISTS- IT'S S. B.

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:47.231
TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT WHICH I

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:48.799
INTRODUCED A FEW WEEKS AGO TO

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:52.436
BAN ON THE PRACTICE OF MISUSING-

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:56.507
RAPE KIT ANOTHER VICTIM DNA TO

00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:58.776
THE AND PROSECUTE. THAT PICKED

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:00.344
UP THE VICTIM IN THE FUTURE IS

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:02.346
TO MISS USE THAT DENIES WERE

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:04.315
CATEGORICALLY BANNING THAT

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:07.485
PRACTICE- WHAT HAPPENED WITH US

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:10.888
OF PITTI WAS JUST JUST SHOCKING-

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.857
MIND BLOWING THAT THAT WOULD

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:15.292
HAPPEN AND I KNOW EVEN THOUGH

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:17.294
CHIEF SCOTT AND SAN FRANCISCO

00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:19.997
HAS INDICATED THAT HE DOES NOT

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.966
CONDONE THAT AND TO GET A CHANGE

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:23.300
OF POLICIES AND EVEN THOUGH

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:24.635
THERE'S A LOCAL AND NOW

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:25.936

SUPERVISORS AND SAN FRANCISCO TO

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:28.906
BAN THE PRACTICE- BUT WE NEED TO

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:30.341
SHUT IT DOWN STATEWIDE TO MAKE

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.243
SURE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:33.644

VICTIMS THAT WE KNOW IT IS SO

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:39.250
DRAMATIC TO COME FORWARD TO

REPORT TO REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:44.221
AND THAT'S WHY SO FEW PEOPLE DO

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:48.426
IT AND IT IS EVEN MORE- DRAMATIC

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:49.994

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:52.956
THAT ANY PROPOSAL TO CREATE MORE

THE FUNDAMENTAL SOLUTION TO

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:00.910
HOMELESSNESS IS- IT'S GOT MORE

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:02.779

DO BECAUSE I KNOW THAT CURRENTLY

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:29.973
IT- EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A NUMBER

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:32.642
OF CITIES AND COUNTIES WHO ARE

00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:35.078

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:37.447
ALTERNATIVES FOR- IF A CALL

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:40.116
COMES IN. THAT RELATES TO A

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:41.818
HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL OR OTHER

00:58:41.885 --> 00:58:43.620
INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT NEED

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:45.121
DIFFERENT KINDS OF ASSISTANCE

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:47.357
AND NOT REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:49.359
RESPONSE. HERE THAT'S STARTING

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:51.194
TO HAPPEN AND THERE'S ALSO PILOT

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:52.462
PROJECTS THAT THE BUDGET IS

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:55.131
FUNDED IT'S NOT YET UNIVERSAL OF

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:57.700
COURSE OR THAT YOU KNOW NEITHER

00:58:57.767 --> 00:58:59.535
IF WE SET UP AN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:01.004
ADEQUATE. NOR IS THERE THE

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.572
STAFFING ADEQUATE OR THE FUNDING

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:06.943
ADEQUATE SO YOU KNOW CERTAINLY.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.344
ALEX WAS THERE GOING TO COME

00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:11.247
INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT. HOWEVER MY

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:13.917
THE ISSUES I HAVE ARE. IT BEHIND

00:59:13.983 --> 00:59:15.218
NUMBER OF WOMEN YOU KNOW PERHAPS

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:17.820
THE DOWNFALL OF BEING A BUDGET

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:22.892
YEARS- IT. WILD DEER OBVIOUSLY

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:27.196
OUR DOJ. HAS A CERTAIN

00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:28.831
RESPONSIBILITIES OVER A LONG

00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:32.035
FORSMAN AGENCIES. WHEN I THINK

00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:35.038
ABOUT WHERE WE MIGHT HOW SUCH

00:59:35.104 --> 00:59:39.008
GRANT PROGRAM DOJ JUST BY ITS

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:41.177
NATURE. DID THE KIND OF STAFFING

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:43.646
IN SUCH IT HAS IS A FAR MORE

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:45.982
EXPENSIVE ENTITY TO YOU KNOW IF

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:48.685
IT IF THIS ACTION REQUIRES THEM

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:49.919
TO WORK AT YOU KNOW HAVE MORE

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:51.988
STAFF IT'S JUST IT'S JUST OF IT

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:54.057
JUST COSTS MORE SO THAT'S ONE

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:57.660
ISSUE. AND THEN ANOTHER ISSUE IS

00:59:57.727 --> 01:00:00.563
THAT. THE YOU KNOW PART OF THE

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.266
INTENT HERE IS TO PROVIDE. THE

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.001
CARD TO SUPPORT STRUCTURES OR

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.270
THE RESPONSES THAT ARE JUST LAW

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.305
ENFORCEMENT. AND OF COURSE THAT

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:11.574
IS OBVIOUSLY NOT DOJ'S MILIEU

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:16.245
EITHER- SO IT DID I'M NOT SURE

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.113
IT'S APPROPRIATE TO REALLY URGE

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.648
I WANT TO SAY PROPRIOCEPTION OF

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.116
FEAR BUT RATHER IT IT'S BEST

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:23.720
SUITED. TO PLACE TODAY DOJ. AND

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:29.425
THEN- ADDITIONALLY WAIT. IF THE

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.260
GRANTS I GUESS I WOULD RATHER

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:34.564
SEE THE GRANT'S GOING TOWARDS

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:37.934
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:41.904
ALLOW FOR. YOU KNOW FOR THE EVEN

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.773
THE CALLS TO GO TO A DIFFERENT

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.074
PLACE NOW I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:46.976
AGAIN WE'RE IN THAT TRANSITION

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:52.081
BUT- SO I APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:54.017
AND THE SPONSORS ARE TRYING TO

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:57.086
ACCOMPLISH. I'M NOT SURE IF I

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.589
CAN QUITE GET THERE IN THE WAY

01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:01.791
IT'S CONSTRUCTED RIGHT NOW. OKAY

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.860
IF I CAN ADD TO TWO COMMENTS AND

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:05.661
I THINK THIS ACTUALLY CAUSES

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:06.162
SOME OF THE THINGS THE

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:08.231
OPPOSITION SAID TO. YOU KNOW IN

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:09.932
IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THE

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:12.435
HOMELESS SITUATION YOU KNOW I'M

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.037
I THINK WE ALL AGREES ADDING

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:15.938
EMERGENCY STATUS- THE-

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:18.775
DEPARTMENTS THE COMMITTEES.

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.777
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT YOU

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.979
KNOW 30% OF AMERICANS HOMELESS

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:25.415
PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:26.416
HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:29.185
PEOPLE- THE OPPOSITION CREATED

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:32.855
SOME VERY GOOD IDEAS- YOU'RE

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:33.956
TALKING ABOUT SOME VERY GOOD

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:36.325
IDEAS. THERE THERE'S NOTHING IN

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.227
MY BILL THAT I WOULD EVER SAY IS

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:40.463
A- ONE SIZE FITS ALL OR IS THE

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.265
ULTIMATE SOLUTION OR THE FINAL

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:43.599
ANSWER. IT'S HOMELESSNESS IN

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:46.536
CALIFORNIA I MEAN E'VE GOT A

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:47.236
HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:48.104
PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO IMPACT IN

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.506
A POSITIVE WAY. THIS IS JUST ONE

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:56.079
STEP ONE SMALL- BITE AT THE

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:59.248
ELEPHANT I GUESS- FOR LACK OF A

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:02.552
BETTER ANALOGY THAT- IS

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.654
PURPOSELY SET UP COMPETITIVELY

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.355
SO THE COUNTIES THAT WANT TO

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:07.023
PARTICIPATE IN THIS CAN'T

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.391
COMPETE FOR THE GRANT TO GET IT

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:13.062
IF THEY WANTED- AGAIN BACK TO

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.363
YOU KNOW SOME SALUTE IDEAS YOU

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.265
PRESENT AND THE OPPOSITION THOSE

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:18.234
ARE GOOD IDEAS TO LET'S DO.

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.269
LET'S DO ALL OF THEM LET'S LET'S

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:21.971
BE CREATIVE IN CALIFORNIA LET'S

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:26.008
LET THE COUNTIES. ALL WORK- AND

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.477
COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT WORK

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:28.811
FOR THEIR COUNTY AND THEN AS

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:30.379
BEST WE CAN COMMUNICATE THOSE TO

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:32.081
THE OTHER COUNTIES. SO THAT THE

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:34.217
BEST IDEAS RISE TO THE TOP AND

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:35.852
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.153
INSTITUTED PROCESS STATE. I

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.322
THINK THAT THIS IS AGAIN IT IS A

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:41.824
SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IT'S A

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.893
SMALL COMPETITIVE GRANT THEN

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.028
AGAIN ALLOWS COUNTIES. TO

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:47.597
COMPETE FOR IT AND HAVE A

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.532
POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ON THE

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.533
SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.435
IMPACT IN A POSITIVE WAY WE

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.370
PICKED D. O. J. BECAUSE UNDER

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.439
OUR WITH OUR RESEARCH FELT LIKE

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:58.374
THEY HAD THE BEST A SYSTEM

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:01.177
ALREADY IN PLACE- THEY WERE MORE

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:03.379
ABLE TO DO IT PASSED THROUGH.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:04.514
WITH THE GRANT FUNDING FROM THE%

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.283
STATE TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.886
WITHOUT HIS HAVING TO GEAR UP AS

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.554
MUCH AS MAYBE ANOTHER DEPARTMENT

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.855
WOULD HAVE TO DO I'M CERTAINLY

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:14.490
OPEN TO LOOKING AT OTHER

01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:17.293
SOLUTIONS AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.427
MAYBE WORKING ON ANOTHER BILL

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:19.896
THAT. DOES A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.564
GRANT TO THE COUNTIES TO A

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.099
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. I THINK

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.568
THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP AND I

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.538
THINK THAT- AS HAS BEEN SHARED

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:30.173
BY ALL OF US LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:31.407
FRUSTRATED WITH THE SITUATION AS

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.409
WELL AND THEY'RE ASKING FOR HELP

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:35.545
AND I THINK THAT HELP COMES FROM

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:36.179
THE OTHER PROFESSIONALS ARE ON

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.381
THE TEAM. AND THAT PROVIDES A

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.783
SAFETY FOR THE TEAM TO PROVIDE

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.585
SAFETY FOR THE OFFICER WHEN

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:43.686
THERE'S MORE EYEBALLS ON THE

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:48.891
SITUATION- EVERYBODY. GETS TO.

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:56.465
PERFORMING THEIR FOR CAPACITY.

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:58.734
APOLOGIZE TO JUST LOST MY LITTLE

01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:04.273
MICROPHONE. OKAY THEY'RE SORT OF

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.742
LIKE THE MIKE SILVERSTONE IT

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:09.745

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:19.121
WE GO- I GUESS IT'S JUST THE

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:21.324
THREE OF US SO I AM GOING TO-

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.593
MOVE FORWARD SO. IT'S MY

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:27.463
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS BILL.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:28.931
AND ACCORDING TO MY NOTES HERE

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:30.766
IT SAYS THE HOMELESS OUTREACH

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:31.367
TEAMS WOULD INCLUDE A MENTAL

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:32.468
HEALTH PROFESSIONAL COUNTY

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.936
WELFARE PRESENTED IN A LAW

ENFORCEMENT OFFICER- I IN THIS I

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:39.609

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:40.243
COMPLIMENTARY AS YOU MENTIONED

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.078

BILL TO ALL OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:46.015
WE HAVE IN PLACE- I WOULD I

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:47.149
WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS THAT AND

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:49.785
MORE OF A COMPLIMENTARY AT

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:51.320
PRACTICE. AND I HAVE TO- JUST

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:54.156
SHARE FROM MY EXPERIENCE- FROM

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:56.058
SPEAKING TO OUR LOCAL LAW

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:58.828
ENFORCEMENT- OFFICERS AND

01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:00.763
DIFFERENT CITIES WITHIN MY

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:03.399
DISTRICT THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:06.002
SIMILAR IN PLACE- THROUGH SOME

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.837
OF OUR CITIES AND THEY HAVE BEEN

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:09.438
ACTUALLY VERY BENEFICIAL TO HAVE

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:12.475
SOMEBODY WITH A PROFESSIONAL

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:17.780
MENTAL HEALTH CARE- PREPARATION.

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.315
TO COME ALONG WHEN THEY'RE

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:20.583
DEALING WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE-

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.618
HAVE- MENTAL HEALTH OR

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:25.354
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- ISSUES I

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.590
THINK THAT IT GIVES OUR LAW

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.325
ENFORCEMENT A LITTLE BIT OF

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:30.326
SECURITY KNOWING THAT THERE'S A

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:31.894
PROFESSIONAL THERE WITH THEM.

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:35.865
AND AND ALSO I THINK IT'S ALSO.

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:37.967
SORT OF AND A PROTECTIVE CITING

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:41.971
IT PROTECTS OUR OUR- MANY MANY.

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:43.539

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:49.945

FUNDING THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:02.425
WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WOULD

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.827
