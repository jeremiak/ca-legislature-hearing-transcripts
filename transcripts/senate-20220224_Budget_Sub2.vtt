IT'S BEEN A- COMPLETELY UNFUNDED

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:07.726
EFFORT- AND IS. AT THE LOCAL

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.294

GO THROUGH TO. TO LOOK AT WHAT

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:16.415

THE DEPARTMENT ON SOME OF THOSE

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.220

TRY TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:29.761
SOMETHING THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE

00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:30.795
AN ISSUE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

00:30:30.862 --> 00:30:37.302

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:55.786
TRANSFERRED OWNERSHIP. BEFORE

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:56.386
NINETEEN NINETY SIX SO ALL THE

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.789
MAJOR INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS IN

00:45:58.856 --> 00:46:01.592
THE STATE MOST OF WHICH- WERE

00:46:01.658 --> 00:46:04.428
PREVIOUSLY RUN BY A OIL MAJORS.

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:05.929
THE MAJORS OUT THERE ARE NOT

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:08.031
LIABLE FOR ANY OF THOSE

00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:09.766
OPERATIONS OF THE TAXPAYERS HAVE

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:11.335
TO PICK UP THE TAB FOR

00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:14.671
EVERYTHING- PRIOR TO THAT NINETY

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:16.673
SIX IF YOU CAN'T FIND A VIABLE

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.844
OPERATOR TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS. IN SOME INSTANCES THAT WOULD

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:23.413
BE CORRECT. THAT'S MY UNDERLYING

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.582
CONCERN HERE IS THAT ACCORDING

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:27.951
THIS THE CCSD REPORT I THINK

00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:29.820
LAST YEAR TWO YEARS AGO NOW.

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:32.022
WE'VE GOT OVER A YOU KNOW AROUND

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:33.790
A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:35.292
IS THE STATE'S FORTY FIVE

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:37.027
BILLION DOLLARS. I THINK THAT

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:38.629
THAT THE BROADER NUMBER BEYOND

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:40.430
JUST DESERTION TO ABANDONMENT

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:41.665
THAT HASN'T RUN ITS COURSE ON

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:43.600
THE TITLE SEARCHES IN THE TENS

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:44.735
OF THOUSANDS NOT IN THE

00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:47.404
THOUSANDS AND THEN- OTHERS

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.339
BEYOND THAT I THINK IS EVEN

00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:51.308
HIGHER. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:52.242
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WELLS

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:53.343
IN THIS STATE SO THE CONCERN

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.579
HERE IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE OVER

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.381
PROMISING AND UNDER DELIVERING

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:59.750
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT-

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:01.418
THOSE SITES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:04.221
THAT- HAVE BEEN PLAGUING THEM

00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:07.524
FOR MANY YEARS- AND IT SEEMS

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.426
LIKE THE PLAN IS AT THIS POINT.

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.295
TO DO IT ALL ON TAXPAYER

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:13.997
FUNDING- SO IS THERE ANY

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.766
OPENNESS OR INTEREST IN THE

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:18.368
DEPARTMENT TO MAKING THAT NOT

00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:21.104
JUST FROM A GENERAL FUND

00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:25.275
LIABILITY BUT TO ACTUALLY- LOOK

00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:28.011
AT THE L. OPERATORS WHO MAYBE

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.947
HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF CAPITAL

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.481
OUTTHERE BUT- BECAUSE OF

00:47:31.548 --> 00:47:33.083
WHATEVER NINETEEN NINETY SIX

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.952
WORK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- ARE

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:38.255
SUDDENLY NOW EXEMPT FROM

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:42.526
LIABILITY. THE ORDER WAS GREAT-

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.027
REAL PRESENT IN THE MEDIA-

00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:46.063
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD OF LIFE

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:47.698
UNDER MEDIA THESE WELLS OF

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:48.999
SETTLERS TO CONTINUE TO.

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:51.435
CONTAMINATE WATERWAYS SOIL A

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:52.836
PRIVATE SOURCE OF CLIMB IN AIR

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.538
POLLUTANTS IN VIA A PHYSICAL

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:55.839
HAZARD THE PEOPLE IN THE

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:58.475
WILDLIFE- THIS IS A ONE TIME

00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:02.145
EXPENDITURE- THAT WOULD BE THE

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:03.480
AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING TO. BE

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:04.281
ABLE TO DO MORE THAN WE'VE EVER

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:06.984
DONE. IN THE PAST- JUST IN THE

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.151
LAST DECADE WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:10.387
TO ABANDON. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:12.389
SEVENTY SEVEN WELLS- WE WOULD

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:15.259
PRIORITIZE- URBAN AREAS OF OUR

00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:16.560
MENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.795
CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS.

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:20.797
THERE ARE LOCATIONS WE KNOW OF-

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:22.299
THEY HAVE OIL ON THE GROUND

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:24.668
RIGHT NOW OF THE WELLS IN PUBLIC

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.503
PARKS. IN THE SAN FERNANDO

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.305
VALLEY THAT. ARE SITTING THERE

00:48:28.372 --> 00:48:29.473
RIGHT NOW AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL

00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:31.108
HAZARD THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE

00:48:31.174 --> 00:48:32.542
TO ADDRESS THIS WOULD ALLOW US

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:35.912
TO DRESS. IF WE DO DO NOTHING-

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.381
OUR OUR CURRENT SCHEDULE WOULD

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:39.316
BE MORE THAN A CENTURY UNTIL WE

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:40.784
CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. YEAH

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:41.952
AND THIS WOULD BE THE MOST

00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:43.787
SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL-

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:46.290
INVESTMENT IN A GENERATION TO BE

00:48:46.356 --> 00:48:47.924
ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE

00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:50.227
LONGSTANDING CONCERNS. A BLAZE

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:52.729
IN A COMMUNITY HAZARDS MARK I

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.698
APPRECIATE THAT YEAH FINANCE HAD

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.833
THEIR HAND UP YEP THIS WOULD BE

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.369
IN ADDITION TO THE OIL AND GAS

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:00.937
AND GEOTHERMAL ADMINISTRATIVE

00:49:01.004 --> 00:49:03.307
FINE AND THE HAS IT IS AN IDOL-

00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:05.175
DESERTED WELL ABATEMENT FUND.

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:07.277
WHICH ESSENTIALLY REMEDIATE

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:09.579
ABOUT ELEVEN WELLS A YEAR THAT'S

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:11.081
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE FUNDS

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:17.621
PAYING. FOR MISTER HALL. THANK

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.756
YOU CHAIR. YES I WAS JUST I WAS

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:20.757
GO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE YOU KNOW

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:21.825
SENATE BILL FOR SEVEN. DIGEST

00:49:21.892 --> 00:49:23.560
AND- THE NOT TO EXCEED AMOUNT-

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:26.129
UP TO FOR MILLION. FOR WELLS.

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.130
THERE ARE A FEW OTHER I AM

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:30.200
SPECIAL FUNDED SOURCES AS WELL.

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:32.502
BUT TO PUT IN CONTEXT. YOU KNOW

00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:34.571
THIS GENERAL FUND AMOUNT WOULD

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:37.174
BE THERE AS THE STATE MATCH- FOR

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.942
WHATEVER MONEY WE POTENTIALLY

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:41.912
WOULD GET OUR WAY. BUT IF WE

00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:43.480
WERE GONNA TRY TO GET AN

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:44.981
EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING IF

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:47.017
YOU WERE TO SAY GOING TO DO THIS

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:48.018
BE A FEES INSTEAD OF GENERAL

00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:50.520
FUND. IT WOULD BASICALLY DOUBLE

00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:51.955
YOU KNOW THE FEE ASSESSMENT

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:54.191
THAT'S PAID. I THINK THE

00:49:54.257 --> 00:49:56.860
DEPARTMENT HAS ABOUT AN ANNUAL

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:57.694
APPROPRIATION OF JUST OVER A

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.429
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:01.198
THIS WOULD BASICALLY BE DOUBLING

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:04.267
THAT IF WE WERE GONNA TRY TO DO

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:05.769
THE SAME PACE AND SCALE. SO IN

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:08.538
OTHER WORDS. LET ME JUST I JUST

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:10.040
WANTED HONEA JUST TO FINAL ISSUE

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:11.942
SO I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:13.710
HOW MANY WELLS ARE GOING TO BE

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:15.445
LEFT BEHIND S. STATEWIDE EVEN

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:16.780
THOUGH THIS IS IT IN YOUR WORDS

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:19.950
A HUGE INVESTMENT AND THEN.

00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:23.053
SECONDARILY YOU'RE SAYING THAT

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.021
YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:26.156
INDUSTRY MATCH YOU WANT THE

00:50:26.223 --> 00:50:28.425
TAXPAYERS TO PAY FOR THE FULL

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:30.894
COST OF THIS CLEANUP EFFORT EVEN

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:33.397
THOUGH THE INDUSTRY IS EXEMPT

00:50:33.463 --> 00:50:35.465
FROM LIABILITY FOR EVERYTHING-

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.734
BEFORE NINETY SIX SO THAT THERE

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:38.468
THERE IS NO INTENTION AT THE

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:41.037
DEPARTMENT TO LOOK FOR INDUSTRY

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:43.240
MATCH HERE. THIS IS ALL GOING TO

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.642
BE THE PROPOSAL JUST PURE PUBLIC

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:48.845
FUNDING TO HANDLE ALL THIS. WE

00:50:48.912 --> 00:50:51.748
DO A IT IS VERY MIXING THE

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:53.350
EXISTING FUNDING A

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:55.886
APPROPRIATIONS THAT DO COME FROM

00:50:55.952 --> 00:50:58.054
THE INDUSTRY BUT NOT NOT FUNDING

00:50:58.121 --> 00:50:59.790
. TO ME NOT NEW FUNDING YOU'RE

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:01.291
SAYING EXISTING FUNDING WHICH WE

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:02.592
JUST TALKED ABOUT DOES ABOUT

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:05.362
ELEVEN WELL SO THEY PUT IN FIVE

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:06.430
MILLION WE PUT IN A HUNDRED

00:51:06.496 --> 00:51:08.532
MILLION. THAT THAT'S ABOUT THE

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:12.035
MATH HERE. BUT WAS IT IS

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:13.003
ENROLLED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:14.471
WOULD I WOULD ONE DIFFERENCE

00:51:14.538 --> 00:51:16.473
WOULD BE AT THIS GENERAL FUND IS

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.909
A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION WHEREAS

00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:20.844
THE INCREASE THAT JUST HAPPENED

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.180
AS A RESULT OF SB FORTY SEVEN

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:24.448
WILL BE ONGOING EVERY YEAR I

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:26.016
UNDERSTAND OKAY AND WE COULDN'T

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:27.784
FIND AS WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:29.519
OF WHAT WE THINK THAT ACTUAL

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:32.756
INCREASE WE NOTE TODAY. THURS

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:33.857
ELEVEN FOUR TWO MILLION BUT THAT

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.792
MAY BE MORE AS DEPENDING ON THE

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:37.060
ACTIVITIES THAT GO ON ON THE

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:42.232
FIELD RIGHT. ISN'T OKAY SENATE.

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:44.100
YET SO BUT JUST JUST SO I'M

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:45.502
CLEAR THAT'S THAT'S I GET THAT

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:47.003
IT'S ONGOING BUT IT'S FIVE

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.573
MILLION FROM INDUSTRY AND THEN

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:50.273
THE PROPOSAL IS ONE HUNDRED

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.710
MILLION. FROM THE TAXPAYERS OVER

00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:54.845
ACTUALLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:57.414
OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS FROM

00:51:57.481 --> 00:52:00.250
TAXPAYERS. FROM THE STATE OF

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:03.487
CALIFORNIA THAT ABOUT RIGHT. YES

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:04.554
I'M GIVING ONE TIME GENERAL

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.323
FUNDS YELLS OKAY UNDERSTOOD AND

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:08.258
THEN AND HOW MANY WELLS DO YOU

00:52:08.325 --> 00:52:09.292
THINK WILL BE LEFT BEHIND

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:11.361
AMONGST THE- ABANDON AND IDLE

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:13.363
WELLS STATEWIDE LIKE HOW MANY.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:15.365
HOW LARGE IT OF THE INVENTORY IS

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:16.600
GOING TO BE LEFT WHEN THIS IS

00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:17.868
WHEN THIS IS SAID AND DONE

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:19.903
SINISTER AND SERVE THE FOOD FOR

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:23.206
A- UNDERSTANDS IS YES IS THIS

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:26.443
INCLUDING. THE ANTICIPATED

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.143
HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE IS COMING

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.044
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR

00:52:28.111 --> 00:52:29.613
YOU JUST SAYING THAT STATE

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:31.214
GOVERNMENT STATE MONEY NOW ALONE

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.850
BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE A

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:35.051
HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE ON TOP OF THE

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:36.253
TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AND I DON'T

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:37.721
KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BUT I

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:40.090
THINK IT'S HALF I THINK IT'S

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:41.024
TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED WELLS BUT

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:42.959
MAYBE FINANCE IF YOU WANT TO

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:44.394
JUST IN THE STATE OR THE ONE

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:48.798
WITH THE ANTICIPATED WITH A

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:51.268
GUARANTEED. FEDERAL MONEY. THIS

00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:52.969
MEANS THERE ARE. THIS WOULD BE

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:55.639
SEVEN FROM THE FROM FUNDS AFRAID

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:56.540
. ONLY PHASE ONE OF THE FEDERAL

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:58.208
THE HIGH SIXTY FIVE MILLION. WE

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:00.443
ANTICIPATE GETTING EQUAL MORE IN

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.280
ADDITIONAL PHASES. SO COULD BE

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:04.047
TWO OR THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:05.248
DOLLARS. AT THE END OF THE DAY

ALL TO BE JUST AS PROPONENT BUT

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.603
- THE- OVER A BILL DOLLARS. SO I

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:03.672
WHAT MY CONCERN IS. IN SUCH A

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:06.074
FLUSH. IN KNOWING. HOW SOME OF

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:07.342
THESE PROJECTS ARE SO FOR

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:08.677
EXAMPLE ON THE NORTH COAST WE

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:11.146
SAW- ISSUES IN REGARDS TO

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.614
DRINKING WATER SUPPLY DRINKING

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:14.149
WATER STORAGE WE STILL HAVE

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:16.752
PROJECTS. NOT RELATED TO- TRAIL

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:18.620
MAINTENANCE THAT HAVE. HASN'T

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:20.322
BEEN ABLE TO BE COMPLETED FROM

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:22.057
WINTER RAINS SIX YEARS AGO WE

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.859
STILL HAVE ISSUES IN REGARDS TO

ROADS BEING WASHED OUT WE SAW

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.930
THE SHOES OF. FIRE WATER STORAGE

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.331
TANKS NOT BEING COMPLETED-

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:31.300
BATHROOMS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT FOR

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:32.935
ABOUT TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:38.307
MONTHS I SAY ALL THIS. IS THAT.

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:38.907
I HEARD THAT ORIGINALLY ANSWER

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.976
BUT- WHY WHY AS IN THEIR ****

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:45.747
FOR FUN. SURE AND AT THIS POINT

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:48.183
IN TIME I THINK IT'S- WORTH

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.685
NOTING THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:52.020
IS A AN ONGOING STRUGGLE THAT

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.822
THE STATE FACES THERE ARE MANY

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:54.957
MANY DEPARTMENTS WITH LARGE

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:57.092
BACKLOGS AT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.361
THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN AS OUT THAT

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:05.100
INDIVIDUAL PEACE APPROACH. WE.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.668
ADDRESSES EIGHT IS NOT THAT WE-

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:11.139
SOLVE AT A SINGLE OUT. ASIAN AT

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:14.610
THE POINT IN TIME. THE I THINK I

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:17.779
THINK THE SENATE. FIRST IS YOU

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:19.848
TAKE CLEAN CARS FOR A THE

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:21.984
GOODNESS CAN UP WITH THE YEAR

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.185
PLAN OF HOW FORTY MILLION OR

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.286
THREE SINCE YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.721
GOING TO GO OUT TRANSFORMATIVE

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:26.955
CLIMATE COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:28.757
SPEND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:31.293

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.694
YEARS WE WANT FOUR HUNDRED

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:34.329
MILLION DOLLARS TO SOME SORT OF

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:35.163
IT DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF THE

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.065
WHOLE PROBLEM BUT IT TAKES CARE

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:39.668
OF A CHILD IT SAYS YOUR WE'RE

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:44.373
LOOKING IN FISCAL. TWENTY THREE

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:45.507
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:47.276
FIVE AND THIS IS THE THIS IS THE

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:48.176
GAME PLAN OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:50.379
PUT IT UP AND NOT PLEASE DON'T

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:50.946
PUT WORDS INTO. WELL THAT'S

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:51.813
CENTER REQUIRES BUT I THINK

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.916
THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHICAL OR-

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.183
SINCE WERE IN FINANCE THE

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:58.053
ECONOMICAL GAL OUR BUDGET IS A

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.588
REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES SO I

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.123
GUESS WE'RE ASKING FINANCE THIS

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:04.660
IS NOT A VALUABLE. OF INTEREST

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.128
FOOD FOR YOU GUYS FOR THE FIRST

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:08.063
DAY CALIFORNIA THAT THAT'S NOT

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.165
THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR PARKS IS.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.000
IS A HAS A LOWER VALUE TEN THESE

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:16.204
OTHER. SUGGESTED PROGRAMS THAT

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.073
YOU HAVE. CERTAINLY AND I. UNDER

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.342
THE- THAT THE FRAMING YOU FOR

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.577
THAT PROVIDE HERE. B. IMAGE.

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:24.913
PREFERRED TO GET TO. FOR

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.014
MAINTENANCE AN ANNUAL BASIS.

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:30.686
THAN COMMITTING FUTURE. THE

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:31.820
AVAILABLE GENERAL THAT YOU HAVE

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:34.189
FROM YOUR YOUR OBVIOUSLY SO.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.057
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:39.328
AND- FOR MAINTENANCE LIST IS

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.330
AVERAGING AS AS SAID PROJECTS

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:43.465
MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE LIVE SO.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:46.568
JUST MAKE NEEDS BOB ARE NOT

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:47.803
SUFFICIENTLY BAD. AND SO RATHER

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:49.171
THAN TRY TO FOR FUTURE NEED AT

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:50.939
THIS POINT IN TIME. THE APPROACH

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:55.277
IS TO. TAKE IT AS A ANNUAL- ON A

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:59.581
BASIS. THROUGH THE AND I'LL IN

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:02.117
IT RIGHT HERE. IS A LOOK. COMING

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:04.419
OUT OF THIS. WE HAVE SEEN HOW

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:06.521
THE VALUE STATE READ PARK- AND

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:09.858
LOCAL. ARE TO CAL. AND THE

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.626
PARKING. WITH THE STATE SYSTEM

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:14.529
IS CRITICAL- IN RYE NOW WE HAVE

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:16.365
SOME BASICS THAT JUST CAN'T GET

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:19.134
MET. IN OVER A BILLION DOLLARS.

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:20.902
IN BACKLOG FOR DEFERRED

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:22.871
MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THERE IS A

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.740
B. C. P. THIS PAST YEAR- THAT

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:26.875
WAS- IT DANCE BY DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:29.344
FINANCE I GET IT ABOUT ON GOING.

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:31.179
BUT WHAT I AM CAN'T REALLY

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:33.248
SURPRISED ABOUT WITH SUCH A

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:36.184
MASSIVE BACKLOG THE LONGER WE

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:37.853
WAIT THE MORE IT'S GOING TO COST

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:39.554
TO TAXPAYERS IT'S JUST BE HONEST

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.223
ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:42.591
AS WE CONTINUE IN THESE

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:44.960

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:46.895

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:48.864
AND- THAT THE SENATE. I BELIEVE

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.232

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:58.840
GOOD FOR THE STATE PARKS SYSTEM.

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:44.299
QUESTION IS THAT LET'S THAT'S-

01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:46.334
TRUMP IN AT FIVE FOR. THE AND

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:47.836
WE'RE GONNA THESE FIFTEEN COST

01:21:47.902 --> 01:21:52.741
ULTRA LAW. AND HAS BIG UP FRONT

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:54.609
FOR. INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT'S THE-

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:56.911
FOR. ALL THAT'S- ONCE. ALL THE

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.513
INTEREST GETS DONE YOU YOU PUT

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.415
IN FIFTEEN UNITS IS THAT IT

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:03.151
WURSTER POTENTIAL FOR. OTHERS AT

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:05.053
A LATER DATE. AT THE END AT A

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:09.924
LOW COST NO JUST KIDDING. I'LL

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.660
GO AHEAD AND TAKE ONE FOR STATE

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:15.830
PARK- SO THAT THE IS PROVIDE UP

01:22:15.897 --> 01:22:16.398
TO FIFTEEN. AND- WE YOU KNOW

01:22:16.464 --> 01:22:18.867
WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE- THE

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:21.436
SITE CONSTRAINTS TO GET ALL

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:24.606
FIFTEEN CITED- IT'S LIKELY THAT

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.474
THE NUMBER'S GOING TO BE LOWER

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:28.176
THAN THAN FIFTEEN PROBABLY

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.945
CLOSER TO TEN- IN THE END WE

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:32.213
WERE WORKING WITH THERE ARE

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.748
THERE'S FLOODPLAIN ISSUES

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:36.217
THERE'S- NATURAL RESOURCES

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:38.253
CULTURAL RESOURCES. AND SEWER

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.089
BUILDABLE AREA IS LIMITED BY IT

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:43.024
BY THOSE THOSE CONSTRAINTS WE

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:44.759
ALSO NEED TO GET A CLOSE

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:46.361
DEVELOPMENT PERMIT FOR THE

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:49.097
PROJECT AND SO- OUR FINAL DESIGN

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:50.298
WILL NEED TO GET APPROVAL

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.533
THROUGH THE THROUGH THAT-

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:54.769
PROGRAM AS WELL- SO WE WILL.

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.838
CONSTRUCT AS AS MANY AS WE CAN

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.907
AT AT THIS LOCATION BUT IT'S

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:02.477
LIKELY THAT ADDITIONAL CABINS-

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.446
AT THIS PARK OR OTHER WOULD NEED

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:05.947
TO BE INCLUDED AT AT OTHER

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.483
PARKS. SO WHAT SO I GUESS THE

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.719
QUESTION IS WELL LET'S JUST

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:11.720
STIPULATE THAT THEY'RE HIGHLY

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:15.890
DESIRABLE IT'S BIG SIR OKAY- IF

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.992
WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAD THE MY

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.427
GENERATION WE GREW UP WE HAD A

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:21.629
DAY TRIP WHERE WE WOULD GO TO

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:23.865
THIS HIGHLY DESIRABLE SPOT BUT

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:25.467
THEN WE GO BACK TO SOME OTHER

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:27.635
SPOT. THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:30.004
MORE CAMPERS ARE MORE OUTDOOR

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:36.044
EXPERIENCE THAT. MAY NOT BE THE

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:38.046
ULTIMATE OF A BIG SERVER MAYBE

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:40.248
DEPEND BETTER THE SUMMER ARE

01:23:40.315 --> 01:23:42.517
MORE LOWER. OTHER OTHER SITES

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:44.386
THAT YOU. IN THE CHEN REGION

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:46.154
THAT MIGHT A COMMON. THIS HIGHLY

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:48.723
THIS. LOW TO COME A- THAT ARE

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.492
RIGHT THERE ON THE FREEWAY OF

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:53.995
BIG SUR THAT MIGHT BE. MORE

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:58.099
ECONOMICAL I GUESS THIS. I CAN I

01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:59.834
CAN PROVIDE ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:02.036
NOT IN THAT THE NEAR VICINITY

01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:06.441
