HEARING OFFICER TRYING TO HAVE A

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.653

IT. DOES REPRESENT THEM AN

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:40.692
OPPORTUNITY EVEN IF IT'S JUST

ONCE A YEAR SHARE THEIR

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:44.062

ISSUES IN THEIR LIVES I LIVE. AS

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:59.044
DEFINED BY THEM. CREATING A FAIR

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:00.779
SHARING SYSTEM STARTS WITH

00:23:00.846 --> 00:23:02.481
LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE IT

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:05.417

00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:07.619
. IT REQUIRES STRUCTURAL CHANGES

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:10.088
IN AND THAT'S WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

ON THE TABLE. MY COLLEAGUES JUST

HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:46.358
CREATING AN EQUITABLE HEARING

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:48.026
SYSTEM FROM THE BOTTOM UP. I'M

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:51.129
GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:51.763
DO THIS FROM THE TOP DOWN BY

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.232
CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF THE

00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:54.900
HEARING PROCESS ITSELF. OKAY

00:23:54.966 --> 00:23:57.769
SMART. WITTY INSTEAD OF A

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:59.938
QUALITY. BECAUSE HERE'S THE

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:01.473
THING ABOUT THE CURRENT AWAY H.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.309
HEARING PROCESS. DESPITE THE

00:24:04.376 --> 00:24:06.344
ENORMOUS POWER IMBALANCE BETWEEN

00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:08.346
REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE PEOPLE

00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:11.082
SERVED BY THEM. IT TREATS BOTH

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:14.886
SIDES THE SAME. IF YOU EXAMPLES

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:17.289
WHEN HEARING IS FILE NEITHER THE

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:20.058
PERSON SERVED OR REGIONAL CENTER

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.359
HAVE A RIGHT TO COUNSEL.

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.495
ALTHOUGH WE KNOW WHICH I CAN

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:25.931
AFFORD ONE. BOTH THE PERSON

00:24:25.997 --> 00:24:28.233
SERVED AND THE REGIONAL CENTER

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.568
NEED TO EXCHANGE WITNESSED TESTS

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.136
AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE BEFORE

00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:33.238
THE HEARING. ALTHOUGH THERE'S

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:35.307
ONLY ONE SIDE WITH FULL TIME

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:37.843
STAFF TO HELP PREPARE THESE

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:40.145
MATERIALS. HEARING OFFICER RULED

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:43.415
SPECS BOTH SIDES TO PRESENT

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:44.649
THEIR CASE TO THE BEST OF THEIR

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.885
ABILITY. ALTHOUGH WE KNOW WHICH

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:48.420
SIDE PRACTICE. AND BOTH THE

00:24:48.486 --> 00:24:49.921
PERSON SERVED IN THE REGIONAL

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:52.624
CENTER CONFINEMENT PEEL IN

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:54.125
SUPERIOR COURT TO TEN NEWS

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:56.561
ALTHOUGH WE KNOW WHICH SIDE HAS

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:58.296
THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS. IT'S

00:24:58.363 --> 00:25:01.166
NO SURPRISE THEN THAT 70% OF ALL

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:03.735
CASES WITHDRAWN BEFORE THEY EVER

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:06.938
GET TO HEARING. WHY PEOPLE ARE

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:09.207
OVERWHELMED AT THE PROCESS AND

00:25:09.274 --> 00:25:11.076
JUST GIVING OUT. ANY CASES THAT

00:25:11.142 --> 00:25:14.379
GO HEARING HIM FOR WINNING ABOUT

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.815
12% OF THE TIME. IT'S THESE

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:19.217
TYPES OF INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:20.452
THAT UNDERMINE THE TRUST PEOPLE

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:22.387
HAVE IN OUR SYSTEMS AND

00:25:22.454 --> 00:25:24.422
UNDERSCORES THE NEED TO CREATE A

00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:26.758
HEARING PROCESS THAT LEVELS THE

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:29.094
PLAYING FIELD. THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.129
PROPOSAL IS A VERY STRONG STEP

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:35.066
IN THIS DIRECTION. HOW PROHIBITS

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:36.568
REGIONAL CENTERS FROM HIRING

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.370
ATTORNEYS TO GO UP AGAINST

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:39.271
DISABLED PEOPLE AND THEIR

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:42.507
FAMILIES AND THAT'S THE PERSON

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.809
SERVED ALSO HAS AN ATTORNEY. IT

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:46.978
ALSO GIVES PEOPLE THE OPTION TO

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.780
ACCESS MEDIATION WITHOUT HAVING

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:51.883
TO GRAPPLE WITH WHETHER TO ASK

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.085
FOR A HEARING AT THE SAME TIME.

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:56.588
TAKEN TOGETHER THESE TWO CHANGES

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:58.790
REMOVED CONSIDERABLE DRIVERS OF

00:25:58.857 --> 00:26:01.559
THE POWER IMBALANCE THAT EXISTS

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:02.560
BETWEEN PEOPLE IN REGIONAL

00:26:02.627 --> 00:26:04.562
CENTRES. BUT THERE'S STILL MORE

00:26:04.629 --> 00:26:06.431
TO BE DONE AND WE CAN LOOK TO

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:08.099
THE HEARING PROCESS FOR OTHER

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:10.001
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:12.637
GUIDANCE. LAKE TSS STATE

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:15.106
HEARINGS GREATER EQUITY IS

00:26:15.173 --> 00:26:18.910
INTERWOVEN INTO THAT PROCESS.

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:21.446
YOU'RE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES.

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:23.515
BEFORE THE HEARING THE AGENCY

00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:25.583
THAT MADE THE DECISION GIVES THE

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.852
PERSON A POSITION STATEMENT WITH

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.888
ITS ARGUMENTS AND EVIDENCE. THE

00:26:29.955 --> 00:26:31.589
PERSON DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE THE

00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:32.624
AGENCY ANYTHING UNTIL THE

00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:36.161
HEARING. DURING THE HEARING

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.395
HEARING OFFICERS HELP

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:39.164
UNREPRESENTED PEOPLE CAN ON

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.866
THEIR CASE INSTEAD OF EXPECTING

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.369
THE PERSON TO AUTOMATICALLY KNOW

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:46.972
WHAT TO SAY OR DO. WE CALL THIS

00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:50.875
ENGAGED NEUTRALITY. WE ALSO KNOW

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:52.010
THE HEARING OFFICERS CAN GET IT

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:54.412
WRONG. SO AFTER THE HEARING

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:56.047
PEOPLE CAN RECOVER ATTORNEYS

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:59.317
FEES IF THEY APPEAL THEIR CASE

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:01.453
TO THE SUPERIOR COURT AND WHEN.

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:03.254
THESE THESE CRITICAL FEATURES

00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:05.290
EITHER DON'T EXIST OR ONLY

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:07.392
PARTIALLY EXISTENCE APARTMENTS

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:09.194
PROPOSED REFORMS. MORE CAN BE

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:13.398

00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:00.357
POSSIBLE REASONS BUT WHEN THERE

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:02.226
ARE SIGNS IN EVERY WINDOW

00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:04.528
OFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:06.530
HOURLY WAGES. IN FOR WORK THAT

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:08.398
IS LESS DEMANDING THE DIRECT

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:10.300
SUPPORT WORK IT'S PRETTY EASY TO

00:46:10.367 --> 00:46:12.436
ASSUME THAT WAGES IS A BIG

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.538
REASON PEOPLE ARE LEAVING. THE

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.073
PROBLEM IS THAT WE CAN'T

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.875
COMPENSATE I JUST SIMPLY RAISING

00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:19.910
WAGES WHICH IS WHY WE NEED

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:22.279
INCREASED RATES NOW BECAUSE THAT

00:46:22.346 --> 00:46:24.681
MONEY WILL GO STRAIGHT. TO WAGES

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:25.916
FOR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:27.084
AND WE ARE WORKING WITH

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:28.886
STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.487
COMMITTEE STAFF TO MAKE SURE

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:32.890
PROVIDERS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:36.026
INCREASING WAGES. WHEN THAT

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.227
MONEY SHOULD ARRIVE. MOST

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:38.629
CRITICALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:41.498
THE IMPACT OF THE WORK FORCE

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.600
SHORTAGE THE BURDEN. IS BEING

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:45.335
SHOULDERED BY INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:47.204
IDEA THEIR FAMILIES AS A VERY

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:49.673
QUICK SNAPSHOT BOTH THE ARK OF

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.742
CALIFORNIA'S BOARD PRESIDENT. IN

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:53.110
PAST PRESIDENT HAVE THEIR ADULT

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:54.678
CHILDREN MOVING OUT OF THEIR

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:57.147
INDEPENDENT LIVING IN BACK IN

00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:58.615
WITH THEM AS PARENTS BECAUSE

00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:00.083
THERE ARE NO STAFF TO SUPPORT

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.919
THEM. AND TRAGICALLY ALSO LOSING

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:04.321
SEXUALLY HOUSING OTHER WAIVER AS

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:07.191
A RESULT OF MOVING OUT OF THEIR

00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:08.425
INDEPENDENT LIVING. WE CANNOT

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:09.526
WAIT FOR THE RIGHT STUDY

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:10.928
IMPLEMENTATION TO TRICKLE OUT

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:12.729
THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THE NEED IS

00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:14.731

BY SOME OF THE- CHEER ARAMBULA.

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:41.725
THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:43.694
GOVERNOR WILL COME TOGETHER TO

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.162

ARE TREMENDOUSLY UNDERFUNDED

00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:11.388
AGAIN WHICH IS WHY. WE ALSO SEE

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:13.457
THE NEED FOR A REGULAR UPDATING

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:15.492

CENTERS IN THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:24.214
AND ESPECIALLY THE CRITICAL

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:25.949
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE

LIMITING THE ROLE OF COUNSEL AND

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.128
BELIEVE IT PRESENTS A THOUGHTFUL

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:39.463
APPROACH TO MODERNIZING THE

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:42.098
REGIONAL CENTER APPEALS PROCESS

HAVE WITH THE DETAILS IN THE TVO

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:49.339
THE FIRST AND I BELIEVE MISTER

00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:51.641
TREVECCA SPOKE TO USE AROUND THE

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:53.677

IS A LOT OF CHANGE AND WE AGREE

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:58.415
THAT THE PROCESS FOR CHANGE

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:00.951
NEEDS TO BE. A STAGED ROLLOUT

00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:03.353
THAT'S THOUGHTFUL SO THAT PEOPLE

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.754
DON'T FIND THEMSELVES CAUGHT

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.423
BETWEEN TWO SYSTEMS WHAT WE'RE

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.791
DOING TODAY AND WHAT WE

00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:10.727
ANTICIPATE DOING IN THE FUTURE.

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.695
AND I CAN'T KNOW THAT THERE WILL

00:52:11.761 --> 00:52:13.797
BE REGIONAL CENTER STAFF

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:14.331
WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:15.265

QUICKLY TO ISSUE FIVE. WE AGREE

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:29.779
WITH- THE LETTERMAN COALITION

THERE ARE REALLY TWO ISSUES THE

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:41.057
FIRST IS A SHORT TERM FIX. HELLO

RIGHT STUDY ACCELERATION WE'RE

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:45.395
PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS IS AN

00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:47.063
ORGANIZATION AS WELL BECAUSE WE

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:49.266
WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:51.601
BACK TO IN PERSON SERVICES AND

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:53.336
TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORTS THEY

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:55.739
NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL THE SECOND

00:52:55.805 --> 00:53:00.610
IS A LONG TERM SOLUTION WHICH IS

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.712
AS YOU SAID- CARE EGGMAN TO

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:05.215

HERE- SO THAT WE DON'T ALLOW THE

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.885
SYSTEM TO FALL INTO DISREPAIR
