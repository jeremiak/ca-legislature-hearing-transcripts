THAT I ENDED UP IN JAIL

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:52.110
INCARCERATED SO LONG IS BECAUSE

AND STARTED CRYING.

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.907
AND THAT I WOULD BE SURE WHAT TO

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:57.242
DO MOST THE MEN WEREN'T SURE

00:27:57.308 --> 00:27:58.510
WHAT TO DO.

00:27:58.576 --> 00:27:59.744
BEFORE I NOTICE.

ROOM -- YOU REALIZE WHAT HE WAS

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.822
SAYING IS NO ONE SEES ME.

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:12.457
SO NO ONE HEARS ME.

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:15.727
AND WHEN I TELL PEOPLE MY PAIN.

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:17.462
NO ONE HEARS ME AND NO ONE SEES

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:21.466
ME AND WHEN HE GOT THE MIKE BACK --

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:22.634
BUT THE THING THAT REALLY

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.836
BOTHERED ME HE WAS IT WAS LIKE

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:25.637
NINETEEN YEARS OLD.

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.405

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:29.040
TIME.

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:31.509
ANY MAN OF COLOR HAD EVER TOLD

00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:33.545
HIM HE WAS WORTH SOMETHING.

00:28:33.611 --> 00:28:35.046
THINK ABOUT THAT HE'S NINETEEN

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:36.714
YEARS OLD AND IT WAS THE FIRST

00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:37.749
TIME.

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:41.086
THAT ANYONE OF HIS OWN PEOPLE.

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:42.654
TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS SOMEONE OF

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.422
COLOR.

00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:46.057
AND I READ.

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:47.692
I THINK EVERYBODY IN THAT ROOM

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:49.828
MADE A COMMITMENT TO TRY TO IN

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.596

THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:55.700
AND WE CAN'T JUST KEEP DOING THE

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.035
SAME THING OVER AND OVER EXPECT

00:28:57.102 --> 00:29:00.105
DIFFERENT RESULTS -- THE OTHER

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:01.072
THING THAT CAME OUT OF IT IS

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:03.174
SIDE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:04.843

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:08.079
THEY TOLD ME THAT -- MAY HAVE

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:10.381
BEEN RAPED.

00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:11.683
AND THEN RAPED AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:14.853

ON APPARENT PRISON.

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:33.671
AND EVERYONE IN HERE'S AN ADULT.

00:29:33.738 --> 00:29:35.573
AND EVEN AS AN ADULT YOU KNOW

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.242

LATER ON OR OR WORST OF ALL

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:03.187
TRYING TO GO TO CONFERENCE

IMPORTANT OUT I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:20.338
THAT WE WE PUT IN MORE MONEY TO

IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:26.377
AND THEN ALSO PUT MEASURES OF

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:29.714
SUCCESS WHICH WE HAVEN'T DONE --

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.215
WHICH WE DON'T DO WELL.

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:32.784

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.158
CAN ACTUALLY HEAR PEOPLE WHO

00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:40.758

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.281
TO CUT THE BUDGET OF FIRE PEOPLE.

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:04.682
THIS IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:06.417

00:33:12.623 --> 00:33:14.392
WE MAY BE LOOKING AT A SEA

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:15.927
CHANGE IN HOW WE DEAL WITH THE

00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:17.428
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:18.629
GOVERNOR'S ALREADY POINTED

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:19.464
TOWARD THAT HE'S MADE

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.732
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT ARE IN

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:22.900
THE BUDGET.

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:24.235
AND GUESS WHAT THIS COMMITTEE

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:26.037
COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INPUT

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:27.972
ON WHAT THAT THE FUTURE OF

00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:29.507
JUVENILE JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:32.543
WILL BE FOR THE NEXT WHAT FIFTY

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:32.744
YEARS.

COULD BE.

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:42.754
COULD BE VERY CRUCIAL BUT PROP

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.388
FIFTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN WE WILL

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:46.124

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.658
OF DOLLARS AND I'M AYE IT WILL

00:33:47.725 --> 00:33:49.060
THROW IN PROP SIXTY FORTY

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:50.395
CANNABIS.

00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:52.563
MONEY ALL OF THAT.

ONLY I WON'T GET INTO HOMES

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:14.185

PENAL CODE MANY OF US HAVE BEEN

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:09.186
WORKING. TO FIND A WAY TO

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:11.589
ABOLISH AND CLOSE THE PRISONS --

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:14.025
AND MANY OF US CERTAINLY HAVE

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:16.193
BEEN WORKING ON SHINING A LIGHT

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.830
ON THE BUSINESS OF INCARCERATION --

00:38:19.897 --> 00:38:22.266
WHICH STARTS AT VERY VERY EARLY

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:24.702
AGES RIGHT THERE IS REVENUE

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:26.037
THAT'S GENERATED FROM.

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.371
PROFILING THERE'S REVENUE

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:28.873
GENERATED FROM INCARCERATING

AND THERE'S REVENUE GENERATED

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:38.883
FROM FAULTY REHABILITATION.

00:38:38.949 --> 00:38:41.285
AND AND THAT ENTIRE CYCLE.

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:42.753
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.121
AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:47.358
INFUSE THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.126
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:50.394
AND THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:53.097
DO -- THE CULTURAL RELATIONSHIP

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.665
IN THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP

00:38:54.732 --> 00:38:56.033
THEY HAVE FOR THE COMMUNITIES

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.435
THAT THEY SERVE AND IT'S ALSO

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:59.270
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE POWER

00:38:59.336 --> 00:39:00.604
OF EDUCATION.

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.006
ESPECIALLY IN AND FOR

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.608
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SO ONE

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:05.910
OF THE REASONS WHY I'M VERY

00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:06.177
EXCITED.

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:08.412
ABOUT THIS -- COMMITTEE IS

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:09.380
BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL AFFORD

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.782
US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:14.151
THE POWER THAT EDUCATION HAS IN

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:16.454
BREAKING THE PIPELINE BEFORE I

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.988

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:21.692
DISTRICT.

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:24.128
AND I CAN RECALL HAVING A

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.663
CONVERSATION BEFORE THE START OF

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.431
THE SESSION WITH A NUMBER OF

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:30.267
FACULTY MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT

00:39:30.334 --> 00:39:31.368
THE FEARS.

00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:33.437
THAT PROFESSORS HAVE DEALING

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:34.939
WITH STUDENTS.

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:39.176
AND SIMPLE THINGS LIKE I'M.

00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:41.112
SAYING A STUDENT'S NAME.

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:42.580
RECOGNIZING THEM.

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:44.348
A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT WE MAY NOT

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:46.650
KNOW THEIR PAST AND SO GIVING A

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:48.519
COUPLE OF EXTRA SECONDS --

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.755
ENCOURAGING FOLKS.

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.090
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE THE

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:55.726
ETIQUETTE THAT -- EVERYONE SORT

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:57.394
OF OWNS INTO WHEN THEY DECIDE TO

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:58.896
BECOME A STUDENT AT A SCHOOL

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:00.664
RIGHT HOW I TREAT YOU AS A

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.733
PROFESSOR IS HOW I WANT YOU TO

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.536
TREAT ME -- EXCEPT AROUND AND

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:08.139
AND AND BECAUSE OF BIAS CITIES

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:09.507
BECAUSE OF THOMAS.

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.175
THAT THERE HAD BEEN A DISCONNECT

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:13.344
AND IT WAS A IT WAS A SOBERING

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.346
IT WAS AN HONEST CONVERSATION

00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:18.315
HAD BETWEEN FACULTY MEMBERS --

00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:22.319
AND THE FACILITATOR ON HOW -- TO

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:26.624
HE'LL OR REFOCUS THE KINDS OF

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.526
ENERGY THAT THEY WERE SAYING IN

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:29.593
THE CLASSROOMS BECAUSE QUITE

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.462
FRANKLY AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:32.763
80% OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE PEOPLE

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.098
OF COLOR AND ARE POOR.

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:35.499
AND AND FACULTY MEMBERS WERE

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:37.134
SAYING YOU KNOW WE'RE HAVING

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:39.203
CHALLENGES TEACHING -- BUT

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.105
LOOKING AT THE HUMANITY THE

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:43.607
HUMAN SIDE OF THE STUDENT -- WAS

00:40:43.674 --> 00:40:45.242
AN EXCELLENT WAY TO KIND OF KEEP

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:47.444
IT REAL AND BRING IT CLOSE TO

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:48.312
HOME.

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.880
AND SO HAVING THOSE KINDS OF

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.215
UNCOMFORTABLE BUT IMPORTANT

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:53.117
CONVERSATIONS AND ALSO TALKING

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:55.252

FOLKS THAT THEIR TEACHING.

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:11.836
THOSE ARE SMALL BUT VERY

00:41:11.902 --> 00:41:14.071
IMPORTANT AND I THINK VITAL

00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:48.419
WHY.

00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:49.953
I ALSO THINK ADULT EDUCATION IS

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.455
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:52.423
AND I WAS ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:54.458
FROM SEVEN IN THE MORNING UNTIL

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:55.893
EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND CATCH

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.227
UP TO ALL MY CREDITS.

00:44:57.294 --> 00:44:59.296
AND FINALLY -- BE AT THE GRADE

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:00.464
LEVEL WHERE I NEEDED TO BE IN

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.032
WHAT WAS THEN THE SECOND

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.567
SEMESTER OF SENIOR YEAR.

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:05.402
AND I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE ON

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:09.740
TIME WITH MY CLASS AND ON STAGE

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:10.641
BUT IT BARELY HAPPY.

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:11.975
I SHARE THAT BECAUSE I THINK OUR

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:14.812
PERSONAL STORIES AS LEGISLATORS.

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.513
HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE WORK

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.748
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE

00:45:17.815 --> 00:45:19.083
COMMUNITIES THAT WE THAT WE

00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:20.717
REPRESENT THAT WE ARE.

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:23.287
ENTRUSTED TO REPRESENT.

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:24.855
THIS SELECT COMMITTEE IS

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:27.091
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:28.459
DO THE WORK THAT'S NECESSARY.

00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:29.927
BECAUSE TWENTY TWO PRESENTS

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:31.428
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY AS THE

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:33.263
GENERATION.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.565
IT'S MY IS MY GENERATION.

00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:35.833
AND SO THE FACT THAT WE SPEND

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:37.468
MORE.

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:39.603

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.338

YEAR AT THE TONE OF SEVENTY

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:43.941
EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:45.442
MORE THAN THE ANNUAL TUITION AT

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:46.510
HARVARD.

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:49.613
AND ONLY SPEND INVEST FIFTEEN

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.614
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SO IN PER

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:52.015
PUPIL SPENDING.

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.150
IS NOT THE VALUES OF A

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.551
DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE OR THE

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:56.120
VALUES OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT

00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:58.122
NEEDS TO CHANGE I AM PROUD TO

00:45:58.188 --> 00:46:00.524
ALSO BE THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE

00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.993

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:07.064
ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN THE WORK

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.232
THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO HERE

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:09.833
AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD. TO

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.735
FINDING SOLUTIONS ON HOW WE%

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:14.271
ENSURE THAT EDUCATION IS A

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:15.939
PRIORITY TO THE CONVERSATION

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:17.608
WHEN WE DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:18.976
CALIFORNIA.

00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:20.644
SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:21.812

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:38.629
STORY FROM MY SIDEBUT IT'S MORE

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:40.197

AND AS I'M WALKING DOWN HERE

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.706
TODAY I'M ACTUALLY THINKING OF

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:52.509
AN ACCOUNT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:54.244
THE BOOK OF LUKE.

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:56.246
THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER.

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.749
WHERE JESUS TELLS A LITTLE STORY

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:00.651
HE SAYS THERE WAS A RICH MAN?

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:02.252
THIS ALL WE KNOW ABOUT THE GUY

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.921
HE WAS RICH.

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:06.023
DOESN'T SAY HE WAS PERSONABLE.

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:08.158
THAN SAY HE WAS LOVED.

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:08.692
DOESN'T SAY HE WAS A GOOD

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:09.893
CHARACTER.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.528
AND ALSO EVOLVING SAY ABOUT

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:13.664
SHOES YOU WERE RICH.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.632
YOU'RE PRETTY POOR INDEED.

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.568
THAT'S ALL THEY CAN SAY ABOUT

00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:17.734
YOU.

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:19.269
IF YOU'RE RICH.

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.637
AND THIS RICH MAN STANDS OUT

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:23.840
BECAUSE THERE WAS A A BAKER

00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:25.475
LAZARUS.

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:28.212
WHO LAID HIS DOOR?

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:30.113
AND IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.915
TO GET EVEN THE CRUMBS FROM THIS

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:34.284
RICH MAN'S TABLE.

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:42.492
ABUNDANTLY PROSPEROUS.

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:45.295
WITH NO HEART. FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:47.264
ARE AT THE BACK DOOR.

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:49.666

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.308
IN HIS ABUNDANCE.

00:47:58.375 --> 00:47:59.243
AND I SORT OF SEE AN AD A

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:01.445

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.524
IT IS IN PART OF THIS STORY

00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:16.760
JESUS SAYS -- EVENTUALLY LAZARUS

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:19.529
DIES HE GOES TO HEAVEN THE RICH

00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:21.064

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:06.216
SO I SAID ON PUBLIC SAFETY WITH --

00:58:06.282 --> 00:58:08.017
THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:10.086
EVERY WEEK WE ARE REVIEWING

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:12.689
LEGISLATIVE POLICY.

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:13.990
I'M NOT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:14.858
EXPANDING THE PENAL CODE.

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.793
AND WHAT I FIND IS THAT -- WE

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.061
TEND TO WANT TO DEFINE FOLKS BY

00:58:18.127 --> 00:58:20.964
THEIR ACTIONS SO IF YOU DID.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:23.867
X. YOU SHOULD GET SEVEN YEARS

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.301
TWELVE YEARS YOU KNOW THEY'RE

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:27.270
GONNA BE PROHIBITIONS ASSESS TWO

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:29.739
YEAR -- CIVIL LIBERTIES.

00:58:29.806 --> 00:58:31.407
AND TO HEAR YOU TALK AND THEN

00:58:31.474 --> 00:58:32.775
ALSO TO HEAR YOU SHARE THAT

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:34.043
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING TO REFORM

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.178
THE POLICE COMMISSION I WAS

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:35.979
RUNNING IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE

00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:38.514
BRIEFLY YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:39.115
CAN WORK TOGETHER TO KIND OF

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:39.849
HELP.

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:42.886
POLICY MAKERS AND OF THOSE.

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:45.321
IN AUTHORITY TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:47.090
WE DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:49.459
DEFINE FOLKS JUST BY YOU KNOW

00:58:49.525 --> 00:58:53.630
THE ONE OR A FEW BAD ACTIONS --

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:54.864
BECAUSE THAT CAN HAVE A

00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:58.835
DISASTROUS IMPACT ON THE JOURNEY

00:58:58.902 --> 00:58:59.435
THAT THEY ALTERNATELY HAVE TO

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:02.305
TAKE -- I GUESS WITH THE WORD WE

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:05.875
USE THIS PROFILING -- IT WORKED

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:06.609
WITH THE POLICE HAS BEEN

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:09.946
FASCINATING BECAUSE OF ONE TIME

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:12.515
ONE TIME THE KIDS TOLD ME.

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.183
OUT OF THIS AS A QUESTION AT THE

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.585
KIDS SOMEBODY PLEASE ARE JUST

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:17.820
LIKE A GANG OF CIVIL ONE WHETHER

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:20.056
THERE'S A GAME TO SAY -- ON THEY

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:27.597
WERE COLORS AND AND THEY DON'T.

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:29.933
THEY DON'T TELL ON THE JONES.

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:31.567
A SURVEY DOWN FOR THE HOME WE

00:59:31.634 --> 00:59:32.702
RIGHT A WRONG GUESS THE WAY THEY

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:33.369
PUT IT.

00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:35.805
AND SO ACTUALLY A BIG HAND IN

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:36.706
THE OTHER THING IS THAT IS THAT

00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:37.740
IS THE THING ABOUT THE POLICE

00:59:37.807 --> 00:59:39.275
LOOKING AT PROFILING THE

00:59:39.342 --> 00:59:41.244
COMMUNITY LOOKING THEM ALL

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:45.882
THROUGH THE SAME LAND -- THAT.

00:59:45.949 --> 00:59:46.783
THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IT

00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:50.053
NEVER EVEN ENTERS INTO MY ROOM

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:51.821
AND WHEN A KID WALKS IN AND I

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:53.423
SEE HIM I DON'T EVEN SEE THEIR

00:59:53.489 --> 00:59:54.090
KI&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOLDER I DON'T EVEN LOOK&lt;/c&gt;

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:54.557
AT IT.

00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:56.392
AND LOOK AT ALL I DON'T WANT TO

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:57.160
THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY.

00:59:57.226 --> 00:59:59.228
AS AN INSTRUCTOR LET ME TELL YOU

00:59:59.295 --> 01:00:01.364
THE TOUGHEST PLACE TO ME WAS

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.666
GOING INTO THE TEACHER'S LOUNGE.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:05.368
BUT I WANT TO SEE TO LOUNGE OR

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.536
THEM TO EAT LOTS OF THE TEACHERS

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:07.737
I WOULD HEAR FROM THE THE

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:12.875
TEACHERS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:15.511
THAT THESE KIDS JUST CAN'T DO IT.

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:16.145
AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T DO

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:17.113
IT.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:17.647
BASICALLY THERE WERE THREE

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:18.181
THINGS.

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:20.016
THE REASONS WHERE THEY LIVE IN

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.551
THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:24.554
THEIR MOTHERS ON DRUGS -- IF I

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.523
WAS IN JAIL HE GOT HIS START.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.124
AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.392
THAT YOU'RE A BAD TEACHER THEY

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:30.827
JUST CAN'T DO IT WELL MY YOU SHE

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.528
WAS THAT I HAD THE SAME KIDS.

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:33.997
AND THEY WERE GET PAYS A BREEZE

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:34.364
FOR ME.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.799
SO MY SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING.

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.267
WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THERE'S

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:39.235
NOW EVEN PUT IT THERE BASICALLY

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.503
THE EXPECTATIONS I HAVE FOR THEM

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.038
WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.740
THAN WHAT THEY HAVE FOR THEM.

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.942
SO DAY ROLLS TO MIND BUT

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.744
PROBABLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS I'M HARD

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:48.511
OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS OUT.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.013
THERE FOR YEARS IS THAT THEY'RE

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.848
EXPECTING IF YOU TALK TO ANY

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:52.215
YOUNG PERSON.

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:55.885
AND I TALK TO KIDS IN THE THIRD

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:57.720
GRADE TO HIGH SCHOOL.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:58.988
THEY TELL ME ABOUT.

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:00.423
TEACHERS AND I NOTICED THAT WHEN

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.758
I COME A TELL ME TELL ME TWO

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:02.625
THINGS THEY ALWAYS SAY THEY

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.227
DON'T LIKE US AND I DON'T THINK

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:05.695
WE CAN DO IT.

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.563
NOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET THERE

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.465
AND THAT.

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:10.633
IF YOU WATCH A KINDERGARTEN

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.435
CLASS WHATEVER CATEGORICALLY

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:15.571
ASKING THE QUESTION.

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:16.973
THEY CAN SET UP BY THE TIME WE

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.907
GET TO THE FOURTH GRADE.

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.409
THEY HAVE SHUT DOWN.

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:20.977
WHEN I GET TO HIGH SCHOOL YOU

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:21.477
ASKED A QUESTION IS COOL

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:23.780

JUST THIS ISN'T SCHOOL IS NOT

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.858
THE PLACE FOR US SCHOOLS ART BAY

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:37.593
THEY BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.728
WHEN THEY FIRST GO.

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:41.297
BUT AFFORD GREAT THIRD GRADE

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.432
THEY REALIZED THIS IS THE PLACE

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:46.803
WITH THEM SO THEY BEGIN TO SHUT

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:51.574
DOWN -- ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEE

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.509
HERE IT'S JUST LOOKING AT

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:55.311

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:51.100
DON'T WANT TO DRIVE -- THIS IS

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:53.202
THE DISCUSSION OR THE PROCESS I

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:54.403
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:55.805

WITH FOCUS JUST ON THE EDUCATION

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.886
PART OF IT -- AND WE ALSO ONE OF

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:11.987
THE FIRST DISCUSSIONS WHAT WE

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:14.957
HAD WAS WHY ARE WE JUST FOCUSING

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:15.891
ON BLACK MALES.

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.126
I THINK THAT THAT'S AN

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:18.561
INTERESTING CONVERSATION ANY

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:21.096
TIME WE JUST HAVE A REPORT

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:22.998

01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:25.367
DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.435
ALL THE METRICS.

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:27.870
BLACK MALES HAVE THE WORST

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:30.172
METRICS OF ANY GRADUATION PRISON

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.741
RATES OF ECONOMIC -- AND THAT'S

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:34.543
WHY WE WANT TO FOCUS THE SECOND

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:36.445
THING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:38.214
BE CLEAR ON IS THIS ARE THE

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.582
SOLUTIONS ARE USUALLY

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:42.518
INTERSECTIONAL -- IN WHAT I MEAN

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:45.054
BY THAT IS -- AN EXAMPLE THAT

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.522
WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:47.923
WHEN THERE WAS A LOT OF PASSED

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:50.059
THE CURBS CORNER OF CROSS

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:50.659
STREETS?

01:08:50.726 --> 01:08:52.394
THE SLOPE DOWN FOR PEOPLE IN

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.597
WHEELCHAIRS IT APPLIED TO PEOPLE

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:57.433

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.701
BLIND PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE.

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:04.406
MULTIPLE A CHILD CARE -- A

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:05.774
CARRIAGE -- THERE ARE MULTIPLE

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:06.942
SOLUTIONS AT A SOLID BUT WAS

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:07.610
FOCUSED ON ONE GROUP AND THAT'S

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:08.511
WHERE I TALK ABOUT THE INTEREST

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:11.146

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.758
THINGS -- SO WITH THAT I WANT TO

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:26.595

MORE BLACK MALE EDUCATORS AS A

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.138
STARTING POINT FOR IMPROVING

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:45.074
OUTCOMES NOT ONLY FOR BLACK MALE

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:46.308

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.185
CRITICAL ASPECT OF ANY PLAN TO

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:58.954
DISMANTLE THE SCHOOL TO PRISON

01:10:59.021 --> 01:10:59.221
PIPELINE.

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:00.422
AND IT'S DEADLY.

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:02.491
DEADLY DESPERATE IMPACTS ON SOME

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.259

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.800
FINANCE ARE ECONOMIC.

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:14.203
REASONINGS BUT I COULD TELL YOU.

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:16.138
THAT FROM CFCS PERSPECTIVE THAT

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:19.141
EVEN IF THE COST MORE.

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.643
IN THE PRISON THE SCHOOL TO

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:21.977
PRISON PIPELINE WE WOULD BE

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:24.913
SUPPORTIVE OF IT -- I I THINK

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.382
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO SELL THAT

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.684
IT'S CHEAPER TO EDUCATE THEM

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:29.985
THEIR CAR STRAIGHT.

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.920
BUT IT'S HUMANE AND THAT TO US

01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:34.657
IS MORE IMPORTANT -- NOT TO

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.892
DIMINISH THE RATIONALE THAT

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.727
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO CONVINCE

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:40.095
OTHER PEOPLE THAT NOT ON

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:42.097
NECESSARY ON THE SAME PAGE --

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:43.165
ONE OF THINGS I WANT TO POINT

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:44.500
OUT BECAUSE WE HAD OUR TASK

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.301
FORCE BE REVIEWED BY -- MANY

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:48.704
PEERS -- THAT HAVE DONE THIS AS

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:50.439
WELL AS STUDENTS WE WANTED TO

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:52.007
MAKE SURE WE THERE WERE CERTAIN

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:53.742
PEOPLE ON THE THE PANEL THE TASK

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:55.911
FORCE THAT WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.012
STUDENTS.

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:58.447
BLACK MALE STUDENTS COULD

01:11:58.514 --> 01:11:59.815
RESPOND TO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.550
WE HAD IS WHEN DID YOU FIRST

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.052
HAVE A TEACHER WHO IS BLACK MALE.

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:05.320
A BLACK MAN AND WHAT DID IT MEAN

01:12:05.387 --> 01:12:07.489
FOR YOU. SIX REYES SAID I WOULD

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:09.124
LIKE MORE BLACK MALE TEACHERS

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.426
THEY'VE BEEN IN OUR SHOES THEIR

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.461
COMPREHENSION LEVEL OF US IS

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:13.495
HIGHER.

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:15.230
ANOTHER ONE SAID THIS YEAR I'M A

01:12:15.297 --> 01:12:17.032
SOPHOMORE HE CALLED US KINGS AND

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:19.068
WE BELIEVE THAT.

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:20.502
THERE ARE MANY.

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:22.237
EXAMPLES OF THAT IN THE REPORT --

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:24.139
IT WAS.

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:26.575
HEART WRENCHING I SHOULD SAY --

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.177
SADLY ONLY 1% OF TEACHING

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:30.345
CALIFORNIA BLACK MALES RESEARCH

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:31.780
CONDUCTED FOR OUR UNIONS RACIAL

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.215
JUSTICE PLAN FOUND AT WHITE MALE

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:35.951
STUDENTS. TO WHITE MALE TEACHER

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:38.087
WAS ABOUT. FIFTEEN TO ONE FOR

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:41.056
BLACK MALE STUDENTS IT WAS.

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:42.324
FIFTY FOUR TO ONE AND CONTINUE

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:43.459
WITH THE INTERSECTION ALLERGY

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:46.962
LATINO MALES IT WAS SEVENTY

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:47.529
SEVEN TO ONE I'M SO WE KNOW

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:48.630
THERE'S A BIGGER ISSUE -- BUT

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.632
AGAIN WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE ONE

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:51.400
ISSUE RIGHT NOW THE GROSS

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:53.068
DISPARITY SCREAMS FOR URGENT

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:54.369
ATTENTION.

01:12:54.436 --> 01:12:56.538
THE SECOND OUR FOCUS WAS TO

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.107
PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

01:12:58.173 --> 01:13:00.042
AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY RACIAL

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:02.177
EQUITY AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS ALL

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:03.178
THREE ISSUES.

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:04.379
IT KEEPS CHANGING AND AND

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:06.548
FLOWING -- BIAS TRAINING THAT

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.217
HELPS TEACHERS AND OTHER SCHOOL

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:09.718
STAFF UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:11.320
PERSONAL BIAS.

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:13.088
TEACHERS SUCH AS ME THAT LOOK

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.157
LIKE ME WE NEED CONTINUING TRAIN

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.126
I AM LEARNING ALL THE TIME I

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:18.627
WENT RECENTLY TO DALIO THAT'S

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:19.995
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.930

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:23.532
WEEKEND.

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:25.334
AND THE TRAINING THAT I SAW

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.602
SPECIFICALLY ON THE TALK SOON.

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:28.804
TOXICITY OF PEOPLE'S LIVES IF

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:30.372
THEY DON'T HAVE ONE PERSON

01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:32.608
CARING FOR THEM -- DOESN'T TURN

01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:34.510
IT CANNOT TURN AROUND THE MENTAL

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:35.477
HEALTH.

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.246
DAMAGE THAT OCCURS -- WHEN YOU

01:13:37.312 --> 01:13:39.515
HAVE DEVASTATING SITUATIONS AS A

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:42.117
VERY YOUNG CHILD -- AND IT'S

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.786
THIS TYPE OF SITUATION AND

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:46.221
SOLUTION THAT DOES HELP THAT

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:48.957
THAT RAISES THE AWARENESS OF NOT

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:50.225
ONLY SOMEONE THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:51.860
BUT SOMEONE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.695
YOU TO HELP OUT -- AND THAT'S

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.964
THAT IS THE SECOND THING THAT

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:57.866
WERE FOCUSING ON ANOTHER QUOTE

01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:59.168
IN QUESTION TO THE STUDENTS WHAT

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:00.502
SHOULD TEACHERS BE LEARNING TO

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:03.405
EFFECTIVELY TEACH BLACK STUDENTS.

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:04.540

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:09.278
ASK WHY.

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:11.013
ANOTHER SAID YOU HAVE YOU HAVE

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:13.448
TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH KIDS

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:15.551
QUOTE KIDS BEFORE YOU CAN

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.253
CONTROL THEIR LIFE WE DON'T WANT

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.121
TO BE CONTROLLED IN THE FIRST

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:19.321
PLACE.

SORRY -- THAT WAS NOT IN THE

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:25.093
QUOTE LET ALONE BEING CONTROLLED

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.529
BY SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW YOU --

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:28.630

GROW TO SUCCEED AND TO LEAD.

THAT'S WHY I BECAME A TEACHER IN

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.406
THE FIRST PLACE -- WE CANNOT

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:38.774
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL WITHOUT

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.309
TEARING DOWN THE OP SCHOOLS THAT

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.378
UM IF YOU KNOW ME FROM THIS

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.213
MORNING HE'S NOT AT T. JUST

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:41.249
REALLY HYPER LIKE IS THAT -- AND

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:43.318
SO -- I KIND OF PUSHED BACK EVEN

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:45.086
HARDER ON THAT.

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.821
AND THEY TALKED ABOUT EXPELLING

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:48.056
HIM.

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:50.158
AND THEN I HEARD SOMEONE SAY

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:50.725
THAT THEY WANT TO PUT HIM ON

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:52.460
REDLANDS.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:53.962
WHAT KIND OF SNACKS?

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:55.730
AND I SAID SOME NON PROFESSIONAL

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:57.265
WORDS.

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:58.066
WHERE THEY HAD TO CALL THE

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.501
RESOURCE OFFICERS AND SCHOOL

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:01.302
POLICE TO ESCORT ME OUT OF THAT

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:04.005
ROOM -- WE WORKED IT OUT AND WE

01:24:04.072 --> 01:24:05.974
WE GOT TO A PLACE TO WHERE HE

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.475
WAS ABLE TO GET THROUGH THAT.

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.077
THE NEXT YEAR MY SON HAD IT

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:11.146
AFTER AMERICAN MALE TEACHER WITH

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:12.380
DREADLOCKS.

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:14.916
AND HE BECAME A STRAIGHT A

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:15.483
STUDENT.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:16.851
ON A BENCH THE GRADUATED FROM

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:18.787
MOREHOUSE WITH A DEGREE IN

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:20.688
BIOLOGY AND MATH AND HE'S NEVER

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:22.690
LOOK BACK AND HE'S NOW A TEACHER

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:24.392
IN LA UNIFIED WHICH I'LL.

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.660
TALK ABOUT THAT.

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:30.498
FIASCO -- TO BUT THERE'S YES MY

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:34.102
QUESTION IS IN HOPEFULLY GET US --

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:36.938
TO THE RESOURCES.

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:40.074
AND THE TEACHERS ARE GIVING.

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:43.311
AS TOOLS TO DEAL WITH -- SO

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:45.146
QUOTE WE GOT RESIDENTS ARE WITH

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:46.181
YOU TO FIND AND HOPEFULLY ONE

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:48.082
DAY WE'LL GET RID OF THE TERM AT

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:49.784
RISK AND CALL THEM AT PROMISE

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:51.586
BECAUSE THESE KIDS ARE RISK

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:56.157
DECIDED OR PROMISES OF FUTURE --

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:58.726
YOU'RE ONLY GIVEN SO MANY TOOLS

01:24:58.793 --> 01:24:59.294
AND SOME OF IT ENDS UP WITH

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.562
REDLANDS.

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:02.464
I DON'T KNOW HOW WHEN YOU

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:03.798
TRAINING THESE YOUNG TEACHERS

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:06.201
WHAT TOOLS YOU KNOW DO YOU ARE

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:08.069
WE NOW TO RUN DE ESCALATION AND

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:10.038
WE DON'T WHAT A WEEK.

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:12.140
AND IF AND IF WE DO NEED TO

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:15.310
CHANGE THE WAY WE WE GET.

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:16.811
TOOLS TO DIFFERENT.

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:18.079
WHETHER TEACHER ON THE JOB OR

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:20.682
WERE YOU TRAINING NOW -- WHAT

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:22.450
KIND OF BUDGET ASK WOULD THAT BE

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:23.751
WHAT IS THAT IS THAT A?

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:25.019
IS THAT DO WE HAVE TO CHANGE

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:26.521
EDUCATION CODE IS THAT SO I MEAN

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:27.155
WHAT

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:29.324
WOULD YOU THINK I KNOW THIS IS

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.359
LIKE COMING OUT OF NOWHERE BUT

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:33.761
THINK IF I HAD.

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:34.896
I COULD GIVE YOU A BLANK CHECK

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:38.233
AND YOU COULD JUST DECIDE WHICH

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:40.235
ONE TO TO TAKE ARM THE TEACHERS

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:40.835
SO THEY CAN DO THIS JOB A LOT

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:42.737
BETTER.

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.105
MATT MASS ART THERE.

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.573
I MENTION THE MULTI TIERED

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.875
SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT THAT'S A

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:50.945
FANCY NAME FOR A NEW SYSTEM.

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:52.914
IN CALIFORNIA FOR HOW WE ARE

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:55.850
STRUCTURING -- SCHOOLS AND IT'S

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:58.019
BRINGING ALL MEMBERS OF THE

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.721
EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY TEACHERS

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.656
COUNSELORS LEADERS FAMILIES

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:05.793
TOGETHER. TO DEVELOP INSTRUCTION

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:06.895
THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF ALL

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.029
STUDENTS SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT A

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:10.198
PYRAMID AT THE BOTTOM OF THE

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:13.034
PYRAMID IS JUST GOOD TEACHING

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:14.302
FOR ALL STUDENTS.

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:16.905
AND HAND AS YOU MOVE UP IN THE

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:19.474
PERIOD THE IN THE PYRAMID YOU

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:21.509
NEED MORE SUPPORTS YOU MAY NEED

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:23.378
SOME DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMS

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:26.114
YOU MAY NEED -- AND A LITERACY

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.616
COACH TO COME IN YOU MAY NEED A

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:30.585
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER TO

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:32.320
COME IN YOU MAY NEED A SCHOOL

01:26:32.387 --> 01:26:33.421
PSYCHOLOGIST TO COME IN.

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:35.356
AND DO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:37.525
RELATED TO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:38.026
PRACTICES.

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.794
BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THAT

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:41.529
SYSTEM IF YOU WERE TO GIVE ME A

01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:42.630
BLANK CHECK.

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:45.733
I WOULD EXPAND THAT SYSTEM INTO

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.869
PRE SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES AND IN

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:49.604
SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:51.673
ALL OF OUR FACULTY HAVE THE

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:54.042
TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE TO WORK

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:56.044
WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND TO WORK

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:58.379
WITH EACH OTHER. ONE OF THE

01:26:58.446 --> 01:26:59.647
AREAS OF EMPHASIS IN THE C.

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:01.282
ISSUES ON COOPERATION BECAUSE A

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:03.117
SINGLE TEACHER CANNOT DO IT BY

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:04.619
HERSELF AND WE KNOW THAT.

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.854
SO HOW DO WE BUILD IN SUPPORT

01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:09.290
FOR TEACHERS TO WORK TOGETHER

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:11.192
AGAIN ALONGSIDE FAMILY MEMBERS

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:11.626
AND COMMUNITY BASED

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:14.062
ORGANIZATIONS. TO GET WHAT EACH

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:16.164
AND EVERY LEARNER NEEDS THAT'S

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:16.764
WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT BLANK

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:21.603
CHECK -- OR GIVE THEM THE FAX TO

01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:22.637
ASK FOR TWENTY FIVE BILLION

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:23.771
DOLLARS MORE.

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:27.742
THAT'S A STARTING POINT -- AND

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.143
AS WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:30.812
WHAT I HEAR WHEN SHE SAYS THAT

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:32.547
IS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS IN THAT'S

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:33.214
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD THESE

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:34.716
COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ARE PROVIDING

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:36.084
MULTIPLE RESOURCES?

01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:36.851
AND IT CAN JUST BE FOR THE

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:38.086
STUDENTS IT ALSO SB FOR THE

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:39.721
FAMILIES -- BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:41.222
THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:42.957
THEIR OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL TIME

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:44.292
THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT JUST THE

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:45.893
TEACHER IT HAS TO BE.

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.362
ALL OF THESE RESOURCES THAT ARE

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:49.030
PROVIDED MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.833
COUNSELING RESOURCES -- EVEN

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:52.500
SITE YOU KNOW.

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:56.170
DOCTOR PHYSICAL RESOURCES -- IN

01:27:56.237 --> 01:27:58.339
THAT THAT IS KIND OF CHANGING

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:02.577
THE STRUCTURE AND AND LOOK OF

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:04.078
OUR SCHOOLS INTO COMMUNITY

01:28:04.145 --> 01:28:05.380
SCHOOLS -- SO THEY'RE ALL TYPES

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:06.381
OF RESOURCES THERE -- THE OTHER

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:09.484
SIDE OF THAT -- WHICH IS.

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:11.052
PROBABLY.

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:12.487
MORE FINER EASIER TO DO OR THE

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:14.155
ART AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE THE

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:16.557
TRAINING OF THE STAFF THE CHEN

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:18.726
IN THE EDUCATION WHEN I WAS A

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:19.360
TEACHER AS A HIGH SCHOOL MATH

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:20.228
TEACHER.

01:28:20.294 --> 01:28:22.063
BUT I PUSHED TO TEACH ETHNIC

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.098
STUDIES I HAD NO BACKGROUND TO

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:25.800
DO THIS I KNEW I WANTED TO DO

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:27.001
THIS NOR WERE THERE ANY

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:28.903
RESOURCES PROVIDED TO ME BY THIS

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.172
SMALL SCHOOL CARPINTERIA -- TO

01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:32.473
DO IT IS AND I WAS TOLD THE LAST

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.876
DAY OF BEFORE THE SPRING

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:36.444
SEMESTER.

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:37.545
AS THE HEAD BASKETBALL COACH IN

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:38.146
THE BILL MIDDLE OF BASKETBALL

01:28:38.212 --> 01:28:40.114
SEASON -- TOLD HAD NEW

01:28:40.181 --> 01:28:41.549
CURRICULUM TO TEACH THAT I DID

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:43.584
ASK FOR BUT WASN'T PREPARED TO

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:44.552
DO ARM AND I TRIED MY BEST TO

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:47.488
PROVIDE TRAINING TO THE STUDENTS --

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:48.356
BUT THAT TRAINING NEEDS TO BE

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.891
DONE TO THE TEACHERS AND THE

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:51.726
IMPACT IS WELL THAT'S ONE PLACE

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:54.696
TO START TO HELP OUT WITH THIS --

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:56.030
BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE AND THE

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:58.399
MONEY THE BIG MONEY QUESTION OR

01:28:58.466 --> 01:28:59.567
ISSUE OR THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:01.002
WITH ALL THESE RESOURCES AND

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:02.003
NEED TO BE PROVIDED TO THE

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.270
STUDENT.

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:04.205
SO THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:07.675
AVOID -- THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:10.378
OUR SCHOOLS AND TO FIND OUT

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:11.713
WHAT'S REALLY GOING.

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:13.448
DO WE ALSO NEED TO DO A POLICY.

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:15.116
MAYBE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.185
SAY YES I BELIEVE IN THAT I

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:21.723
UNDERSTAND THAT OTHERS MAY SAY.

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:23.458
I DON'T NEED IT IS THAT BECAUSE

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:24.826
YOU KNOW WE MAKE POLICY PRE

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:25.893
ENTIRE STATE.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.361
WE BUDGET FOR THE ENTIRE STATE

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:30.098
AND AND THIS BIG STATE NOT

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:31.799
EVERYBODY BUYS IN.

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:33.201
RIGHT TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:35.236
IT I THINK EVERY DISTRICT NEEDS

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:35.770
TO BUY IT.

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.839
SO IS THAT ALSO POLICY

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:38.740
CONSIDERATIONS.

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:40.475
BECAUSE THE POLICY CONSIDERATION

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:43.444
AYE AYE -- DEFER TO MY SCHOOL

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:45.179
DISTRICT COLLEAGUES IN TERMS OF

01:29:45.246 --> 01:29:46.514
WHAT WORKS BEST WITHIN THEIR

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:48.216
COMMUNITY AND HOW ARE THEY

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:49.851
DEFINING THIS IDEA OF A

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.219
COMMUNITY SCHOOL.

01:29:51.285 --> 01:29:53.855
MASS FOR ONE MORE THING SINCE

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:55.056
YOU.

01:29:55.123 --> 01:29:55.790
YOUR BOOK.

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:57.992
IF AND IT WAS MENTIONED.

01:29:58.059 --> 01:30:00.294
EARLIER -- BY THE PREVIOUS TWO

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:02.163
SPEAKERS AND IT'S ABOUT

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.165
RECRUITING MORE TEACHERS OF

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.867
COLOR TO WORK IN OUR SCHOOLS AND

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:08.136
SO -- I KNOW WE HAVE A

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:10.238
FORGIVABLE LOAN PROGRAM THAT HAS

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:11.806
BEEN APPROVED THIS YEAR BY THE

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:13.975
LEGISLATURE AND I AM VERY

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:15.076
APPRECIATIVE OF THAT.

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:17.845
WE NEED MORE OF THAT WE NEED

01:30:17.912 --> 01:30:20.815
SERVICE SCHOLARSHIP -- FOR OUR

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:18.773
WHOLE LOT OF TEACHERS IT

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:19.907

BACK POCKET.

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.380
I DO AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT.

01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:28.015
STRUCTURAL AND I REALLY

APPRECIATE.

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:33.521
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:35.423
CREATING A SYSTEM WE'RE YOUR

01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:36.724
TRAINING TEACHERS TEACHING

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:37.892
TEACHERS ABOUT THE BIGGER

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:40.695
ASPECTS OF WHAT IT IS BUT WHAT I

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.463
WORRY ABOUT IS WE KEEP.

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:43.664
THROWING MORE AND MORE

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:45.833
OBLIGATION ON OUR TEACHERS WHO

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.669
WANT TO GO AND TEACH.

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:49.537
WHERE THE SOCIAL SERVICES

01:31:49.604 --> 01:31:51.672
AGENCIES WHERE THE HEALTH

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:52.840
SERVICES AGENCIES?

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:54.942
FROM THIS NOTION OF A COMMUNITY

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:55.810
SCHOOL.

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:58.079
BECAUSE IF IF THE IF THE SCHOOLS

01:31:58.145 --> 01:32:01.415
ARE NOW IT IS A GREAT NOTION.

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:02.550
BUT WE HAVE TO COMPLETE THE

01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:03.818
PICTURE.

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:06.687
SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT.

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:08.556
IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:09.891
TRAINING TO TEACHERS THAT WERE

01:32:09.957 --> 01:32:10.892
NOT TURNING THEM INTO SOCIAL

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:11.492
WORKERS THAT WERE NOT TURNING

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.461
THEM INTO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

01:32:13.527 --> 01:32:14.195
INTO.

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:15.897
THOSE COMPONENTS HAVE TO COME IN

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:17.465
AS WELL.

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:19.600
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.102
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:22.536
WERE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:23.638
BECAUSE WHEN THE PROBLEMS THAT I

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:25.206
HAVE HERE IS WE'RE ALWAYS

01:32:25.273 --> 01:32:27.108
LOOKING AT THE BACK AT WERE JUST

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:28.542
WE WERE TRYING TO REFORM THE

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:30.411
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:31.045
WHICH IS THE SYSTEM WE SHOULD

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:32.280
EVEN HAVE.

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:32.847
WHICH I TO REFORM THE CHILD

01:32:32.914 --> 01:32:35.650
WELFARE SYSTEM WHICH IS A SYSTEM

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:36.417
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE.

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:39.220
ALL OF THIS GOES POINTS BACK.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:40.655
TO SUPPORTS FOR FAMILIES AND

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:43.624
COMMUNITIES SO THAT IS KIDS COME

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:44.926
INTO THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:47.828
THEY THEY ARE PREPARED TO LEARN

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:51.565
AND TO DO THAT WORK AS A STUDENT.

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:53.768
AND YET WE HAVE A WHOLE SYSTEM

01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:55.670
THAT SUPPORTS THEM IN SUPPORT

01:32:55.736 --> 01:32:57.238
THE TEACHERS IN SUPPORT LET'S

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:58.673
TEACHERS KIND OF DO WHAT THEY

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:00.574
NEED TO DO FOR BRING ALL OF

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:01.976
THESE COMPONENTS TO BEAR.

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:03.644
SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE THE

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.212
PROBLEMS IN THE FAMILY.

01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:06.647
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SPOKE.

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:08.282
WITH ALL THE PRO FOR THE CHILD

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:10.718
WITHOUT DEALING WITH THAT FAMILY

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.653
AND THAT COMMUNITY AND AND WHERE

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.021
THEY'RE COMING FROM.

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:16.157
SO HOW DO WE RE THINK THIS

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:18.993
SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE ALL OF

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.362
THOSE COMPONENTS THERE AND WHEN

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:21.996
WE DON'T JUST KEEP PUTTING THIS

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:25.700
ON ON THE TEACHERS.

01:33:25.766 --> 01:33:27.435
WELL -- AS A HIGH SCHOOL MATH

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:28.536
TEACHER.

01:33:28.602 --> 01:33:29.670
I BECAME A HIGH SCHOOL MATH

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:30.972
TEACHER NOT.

01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:32.974
I TOOK MATH BECAUSE IT WAS EASY

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.075
FOR ME NOT BECAUSE I WANTED TO

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:35.576
TEACH IT I WANTED TO HELP

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:36.510
STUDENTS.

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:38.079
SO THE CONCEPT THE TEACHERS WANT

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:41.015
TO TEACH ISN'T IS IS TOO NARROW

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:42.483
TEACHERS WANT TO HELP.

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:44.085
AND I DON'T OBEY I DID WANT AYE

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.720
AYE OTHERS AT DISCOUNT YEAH OKAY

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:48.189
BUT I WORRY ABOUT THROWING TOO

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:49.490
MUCH ON THE TO PUBLICATION.

01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:51.425
I TEACHERS WHO WANT TO HELP BUT

01:33:51.492 --> 01:33:52.460
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:55.563
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A CLASSROOM

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:56.130
TOO MANY KIDS IN A CLASSROOM

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:57.298
REYES AWAY.

01:33:57.365 --> 01:33:58.733
BUT THEY HAVE THAT BROADER

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:00.501
RESPONSIBILITY THEY NEED TO HELP.

01:34:00.568 --> 01:34:03.270
THEY CAN'T BE THERE ONE OF THE

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:05.906
THAT A NEXUS HOW ALL THIS WORKS

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:09.643
TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:10.144
KIDS FOR SO MANY TIMES.

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:10.711
IF WE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:11.779
PARENTS CAN ABDICATE THEIR

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:12.980
RESPONSIBILITIES WERE OTHER

01:34:13.047 --> 01:34:14.782
PARTS THE SYSTEM ARE OPERATING

01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:17.118
IN SILOS AND NOT SUPPORTING THIS

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:18.319
FUNCTION.

01:34:18.386 --> 01:34:20.321
MORE AND MORE THAN FALLS ONTO

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:21.422
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:22.490
TEACHER FOR HOME WE HAVE

01:34:22.556 --> 01:34:24.258
NECESSARILY HAVE THE TOOLS FOR

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:26.227
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE A

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:27.928
FORTY TO GO SOLVE ALL THESE

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:30.364
PROBLEMS IN AND I AGREE THERE

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:31.165
WILL THERE IS A LOT -- HANDED

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:32.967
DOWN ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:34.769
FRUSTRATIONS IS THE OVER

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:37.805
ACADEMIA FOCUS.

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:39.473
AND THE SCHOOLS -- THAT'S ONE OF

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:41.075
THE REASONS WHY I LEFT THE

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:43.811
CLASSROOM WAS BECAUSE I HAD LAST

01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:45.613
TIME TO WORK WITH THE STUDENTS

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:47.114
AND HAD TO FOCUS ON THEIR

01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:49.216
INDIVIDUAL ISSUES AND HAD TO

01:34:49.283 --> 01:34:50.584
FOCUS BECAUSE AS A MATH TEACHER.

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:52.019
AND I WAS THERE WHEN THE HIGH

01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:54.455
SCHOOL EXIT EXAM WAS PASSED --

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:56.057
AND THERE WAS SO MUCH EMPHASIS

01:34:56.123 --> 01:34:57.158
THE OTHER THING IS NOT TO FORGET

01:34:57.224 --> 01:34:59.360
THE CLASSIFIED AS WELL BECAUSE

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:03.330
THE CLASSIFIED HAVE A AS HAVING

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:05.966
ACTUAL VESTED ADULTS ON CAMPUS

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:07.468
WHETHER THEY'RE THE JANITORS TO

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.070
THE SECRETARIES.

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:11.005
HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:12.406
DAY TODAY I KNOW SO MANY

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:14.575
CLASSIFIED THAT THEY'RE THE ONES

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:15.443
THAT ARE ACTUALLY COUNSELING THE

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:16.744
STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:18.112
ONES THAT LOOK MORE LIKE THE

01:35:18.179 --> 01:35:20.581
STUDENTS -- IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:22.483
SITUATION SAID THERE THAT'S

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:23.384
WHERE THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL COMES

01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:26.320
IN -- AS WELL AS ADDING THOSE

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:28.789
RESOURCES TO TAKE AWAY THE

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:31.592
ACTUAL -- LEGITIMATE COUNSELING

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:32.860
FROM THE TEACHER WITH.

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:34.128
TEACHERS WANT TO COUNSEL

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:35.896
STUDENTS BUT NOT IN A CLINICAL

01:35:35.963 --> 01:35:38.399
WAY WEEDING CLINICAL COUNSELORS

01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:39.533
THERE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.135
TRYING TO DEMAND AN AD -- SO I

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:42.369
THINK WE AGREE ON MOST OF THE

01:35:42.436 --> 01:35:43.704
THINGS I WAS JUST TRYING -- TO

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:45.239
CLUB MED BUT I JUST WANT TO PUT

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:46.440
THAT ON THE TABLE AND I THINK

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:47.208
IT'S EXCITING IT'S ARE

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:47.942
INTERESTING.

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.510
BUT SORT OF BACK TO THE CHAIRS

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:51.145
COMMENT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:53.814
BE WORKING ON SO THAT WE ARE

01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:54.281
BUILDING.

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:56.350
TAKING ALL OF THESE FUNCTIONS

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:58.152
THAT ARE INTENDED TO HELP KIDS

01:35:58.219 --> 01:36:00.721
OUT OF THE SILOS.

01:36:00.788 --> 01:36:01.689
AND INTO A COORDINATED WAY

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:02.189
YOU'RE SORT OF LAY THAT

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:03.457
GROUNDWORK BUT YOU JUST ONE

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:04.425
PIECE OF THIS.

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:06.060
YOU CAN'T DO THAT A LOT RIGHT

01:36:06.127 --> 01:36:07.528
AND THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA MULTI

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:09.430
TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:12.433
FRAMEWORK AND ON YOU HAVE A COPY

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:12.800
OF MY REMARKS.

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.668
AND THERE'S SOME RESOURCES AT

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:19.140
THE END THIS IS A SYSTEMIC WAY

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:21.008
TO LOOK AT SUPPORTING ALL

01:36:21.075 --> 01:36:22.309
STUDENTS AND ALL TEACHERS

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:24.278
BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:25.613
WE SHOULD NOT PUT THE SOLE

01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:27.047
RESPONSIBILITY.

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:29.016
ON A SINGLE TEACHER TO MEET THE

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:30.885
NEEDS OF EACH AND EVERY LEARNER

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:32.553
IN HER CLASSROOM WITHOUT THE

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.855
SUPPORT OF FAMILIES AND OTHER

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:36.190
EDUCATORS WHO ARE IN THAT.

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:38.959
SO I I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEND

01:36:39.026 --> 01:36:40.261
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

01:36:40.327 --> 01:36:41.862
SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IT'S IN OUR

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:42.863
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:43.931
EDUCATION.

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:46.734
IT'S WORKING -- ACROSS ABOUT

WANTED TO DISCUSS THE HOW TO THE

01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:42.916
A MODEL.

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:45.919

01:38:58.432 --> 01:38:59.800
HAVE FIVE WHOLE MINUTES.

01:38:59.867 --> 01:39:00.734
SO.

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:03.837
SO I AM I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT

01:39:03.904 --> 01:39:05.372
THE FIRST THING THAT I FOUND

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:06.373
I'VE BEEN WITH US RULES TWELVE

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.108
YEARS WORKING AS CAPACITY SIX

01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:09.343
AND A HALF YEARS AND THERE ARE

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:11.145
PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW WE TALK

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.446
ABOUT FINDING DIVERSE.

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:14.682
CANDIDATES WE TALK ABOUT BLACK

01:39:14.748 --> 01:39:16.016
MALE FACULTY A LOT OF

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:16.984
COMMUNITIES JUST UNAWARE OF

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:18.519
THESE OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S THE

01:39:18.585 --> 01:39:20.587
FIRST THING THAT WE DON'T THAT

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:21.488
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

01:39:21.555 --> 01:39:22.056
DON'T KNOW.

01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:24.458
SO -- MY APPROACH HAS BEEN TO

01:39:24.525 --> 01:39:26.794
GET WHERE PEOPLE ARE.

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:27.528
AND THEY MORE SPECIFICALLY GET

01:39:27.594 --> 01:39:28.462
WERE COMMUNITIES ARE AND THEN

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:29.697
USE OTHER.

01:39:29.763 --> 01:39:31.799
PEOPLE AND THEIR AFFINITY GROUPS

01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:33.534
TO SPREAD THE WORD FOR EXAMPLE

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.368
I'M A MEMBER OF A LOT OF

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:35.703
AFFINITY GROUPS FOR AFRICAN

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:37.037
AMERICAN WOMEN -- BLACK WHEN

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:38.372
ORGANIZED POLITICAL ACTION

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:39.940
ZACHMAN SISTER CIRCLE ALL OF

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:42.076
THESE GROUPS AT LARGE IN NUMBER

01:39:42.142 --> 01:39:43.677
SO WHEN I SHARE AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:45.512
IT'S BROAD AND THEN I ASK THE

01:39:45.579 --> 01:39:47.348
SAME OF MY NATIVE DEAN AT

01:39:47.414 --> 01:39:48.248
SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE AND SHE

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:50.451
SHARES WITH HER COMMUNITY THAT I

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:52.586
HAVE NO ACCESS.

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:53.387
TO SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:56.390
THINGS I DO AS WELL TO HELP WITH --

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:57.791
AWARENESS RECRUITMENT OF

01:39:57.858 --> 01:39:59.193
SPECIFIC GROUPS AND THEN

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:00.594
GENERALLY THERE FOR CAREER

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:01.795
INTACT THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS

01:40:01.862 --> 01:40:03.464
THAT WORK AND DON'T WORK BUT WE

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:05.432
WEREN'T WE WEREN'T DOING THAT WE

01:40:05.499 --> 01:40:07.801
WEREN'T SCHERING ENOUGH -- I GO

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:09.603
WHERE PEOPLE ARE I HOPE PEOPLE

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:12.106
WHEN I NEED A FARSI FACULTY OR

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:14.208
LONG FACULTY I DON'T PLACE AN AD

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:15.442
I TRY TO GET AND COMMUNITY

01:40:15.509 --> 01:40:16.477
THOUGHT WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:18.412
ENOUGH. TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:20.614
TABLE SO YOU CAN'T HAVE FACULTY

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.783
OF COLOR AND AND STAFF OF COLOR

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:23.384
IF YOU DON'T THEY DON'T EVEN

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:24.418
KNOW IT EXISTS.

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:25.986
AND SO THAT'S A HUGE PART OF

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:27.154
WHAT I DO EVERYDAY I'M VERY

01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:28.922
INTENTIONAL ABOUT THAT AND I

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:30.557
LOOK AT THE OUR ALLY FOR LIKE

WHEN I SPEND THE MONEY OR WHEN I

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:33.861
GO OUT IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:34.528
A WHAT I CHOOSE TO DO AS FAR AS

01:40:34.595 --> 01:40:35.396
RECRUITMENT.

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:38.031
SO THAT'S HUGE AND THEN AS THE

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:38.966
PRESIDENT OF BLACK FACULTY AND

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:40.367

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:42.770
FOR TWENTY YEARS THEY THOUGHT

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:43.504
ABOUT.

01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:46.273
ME BEFORE I EVEN KNEW ABOUT

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.474
LET'S REELS AND SO I AM JUST

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:48.809
TRYING TO PUSH THAT WE DO A LOT

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:50.944
OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT MOST OF

01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:52.479

THIS END.

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:58.919
AND SO WE SUPPORT THEM WE ALSO

01:40:58.986 --> 01:41:05.225
DO A LOT OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH.

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:05.859
TO MAKE OPPORTUNITIES UP MAKE

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:06.460
PEOPLE AWARE OF OPPORTUNITIES

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:07.094
FOR FACULTY AND STAFF AND THEN.

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:07.694
HARD.

01:41:07.761 --> 01:41:11.231
HITTING HOW TO MOCK INTERVIEWS

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:13.834
AND EXAMPLE OF HOW PANEL TO RUN

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.636
FOR THE PEOPLE CAN COMPETE WHEN

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:17.137
THEY MAKE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS.

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:19.706
FOR LOS REELS WE TRACK EQUITY --

01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:21.074
IN OUR DEMOGRAPHICS SO WHO

APPLIED WHO WITH INTERVIEW WHO

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:25.179

GET A FORM AND SENSE OF EACH

01:41:27.314 --> 01:41:28.615
COMEDIAN WHAT'S HAPPENING.

01:41:28.682 --> 01:41:29.883

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:31.618
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL I'M

01:41:31.685 --> 01:41:33.320

VERY IMPORTANT.

01:48:44.684 --> 01:48:46.686
BUT I THINK BECAUSE OF LONG

01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:49.823
STANDING BIASES POLICIES WE'VE.

01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:52.959
THE SYSTEM.

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:55.695
IS WERE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:56.897
GETTING SORT OF TEACHERS IN THE

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:58.064
SCHOOLS THEY NEED TO BE AND AND

01:48:58.131 --> 01:48:59.466
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:48:59.532 --> 01:49:01.001
THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE STRUGGLING

01:49:01.067 --> 01:49:02.235
IN THE LOWER ECONOMIC.

01:49:02.302 --> 01:49:04.237
END OF THE SCALE TEND TO BE THE

01:49:04.304 --> 01:49:05.238
ONES THAT HAVE HIGHER

01:49:05.305 --> 01:49:08.642
POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS OF COLOR

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:09.643
SO WE NEED TO PUT TEACHERS THERE.

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:11.878
WE KNOW THAT.

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:15.148
AND YET WE AND WE PUT TEACHERS

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:17.350
IN THOSE CLASSROOMS.

01:49:17.417 --> 01:49:18.885
THAT -- TEND TO BE LESS

01:49:18.952 --> 01:49:21.288
EXPERIENCE THAN THE MENTOR

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:23.423
TEACHERS ME THIS THIS IS SORT OF

01:49:23.490 --> 01:49:23.890
THE THING THAT WE HAVE

01:49:23.957 --> 01:49:25.058
PERPETUATED.

01:49:25.125 --> 01:49:26.426
SO IF WE'RE GONNA PUT.

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:27.694
NEWER TEACHERS AND WE RECRUIT

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:28.962
THESE TEACHERS AND WE DO A

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:30.730
REALLY GOOD JOB BY DEFINITION

01:49:30.797 --> 01:49:32.465
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE YOUNG

01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:34.801
TEACHERS NEWER TEACHERS.

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:36.670
AND THEY CAN BENEFIT THE

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:38.138
STUDENTS BUT WHO'S NOW

01:49:38.204 --> 01:49:40.106
BENEFITING THOSE TEACHERS.

01:49:40.173 --> 01:49:43.810
AND SO FOR FOR A TEACHER.

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:45.912
I'M ASSUMING THE TEACHER IS IS

01:49:45.979 --> 01:49:47.914
ALSO SO IN AT A BLACK TEACHER

01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:50.417
HAVING A BLACK TEACHER MENTOR

01:49:50.483 --> 01:49:51.918
WOULD BE IDEAL.

01:49:51.985 --> 01:49:53.853
HOW DO YOUNG TEACHERS RESPOND

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.288
THOUGH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:56.323
THAT MANY?

01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:57.824
BLACK MENTOR TEACHERS WERE GONNA

01:49:57.891 --> 01:50:00.493
HAVE WHITE MENTOR TEACHERS OR

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.529
OTHERS HOW WELL DO THOSE YOUNG

01:50:02.595 --> 01:50:04.864
TEACHERS RESPOND TO MENTORS WHO

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:07.133
DON'T NECESSARILY LOOK LIKE.

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.168
THEY DO.

01:50:08.234 --> 01:50:09.436
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:11.972
TO GET OVER THIS HURDLE.

01:50:12.038 --> 01:50:13.940
SO WE HAVE SOME SOME SYSTEM OF

01:50:14.007 --> 01:50:15.241
THINGS WE HAVE TO OVERCOME.

01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:17.911
AND I AM VERY DISTURBED BY.

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:20.447
SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:22.315
THE BISON RECRUITING IN THE VICE

01:50:22.382 --> 01:50:24.651
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BRING.

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:26.886
TEACHERS INTO THIS PIPELINE.

01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:28.922
BUT IT WE DON'T BY DEFINITION

01:50:28.989 --> 01:50:30.690
HAVE THE THAT THE RIGHT SUPPORTS

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:32.192
FOR THOSE TEACHERS.

01:50:32.258 --> 01:50:33.660
WE'RE GONNA LIMP ALONG HOW DO WE

01:50:33.727 --> 01:50:35.362
DO THAT HOW DO WE CREATE THE

01:50:35.428 --> 01:50:38.064
SYSTEM THAT THAT ENDS UP LOOKING

01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:39.899
THE WAY IT'S GOING TO NEED.

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.167
TO THAT WE CAN THEN BRING INTO

01:50:41.234 --> 01:50:42.102
THAT PIPELINE.

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:43.837
THE RATE.

01:50:43.903 --> 01:50:45.772
THE RIGHT TEACHERS SO THAT THEY

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:47.474
CAN THEN BECOME THOSE TEACHER

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:48.875
MENTORS THAT OTHERS MAY BE

01:50:48.942 --> 01:50:50.210
LOOKING MORE BROADLY SO NOT JUST

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:51.144
TEACHERS THAT LOOKS SO FOR

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:53.013
EXAMPLE THERE'S A FARLEY STUDY

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:54.280
THAT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE --

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:55.515
STUDENTS THAT A TEACHER I

01:50:55.582 --> 01:50:56.950
DIVERSE TEACHER NOT EVEN

01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:58.485
NECESSARILY THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:50:58.551 --> 01:50:59.919
AFRICAN AMERICAN BUT STILL

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:01.721
BENEFIT ME AS AN AFRICAN

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:02.822
AMERICAN WOMAN MAYBE MORE

01:51:02.889 --> 01:51:04.691
BROADLY SO NOT EXACTL A MATCH

01:51:04.758 --> 01:51:06.926
AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT THE

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:09.095
EMPLOYMENT HOLD AFFINITY HOLE.

01:51:09.162 --> 01:51:11.364
SO I AM THAT TWENTY YEAR VETERAN

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:12.832
STAFF MEMBER COULD ALSO BE OF

01:51:12.899 --> 01:51:14.634
ASSISTANCE TO A NEW TEACHER DO

01:51:14.701 --> 01:51:15.301
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN LOOK AT THE

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:16.603
WHOLE.

01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:17.971
AND SO IF I'M IN LIKE THAT COULD

01:51:18.038 --> 01:51:19.506
IN STAFF AND THERE'S SOMEONE IN

01:51:19.572 --> 01:51:21.041
THAT GROUP THAT CAN SUPPORT ME I

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:22.609
SUPPORT DEANS AND ADMINISTRATORS

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:24.010
ALL THE TIME AND I'M NOT A D.

01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:25.945
NORMAN STRAIGHTER R FACULTY BUT

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:26.980
I SUPPORT THEM ALL THE TIME.

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:28.248
AND SO WITH THAT CAN HAPPEN I

01:51:28.314 --> 01:51:29.649
THINK THE COMMUNITY.

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:31.551
AND SO THAT'S A ONE PIECE THAT

01:51:31.618 --> 01:51:33.019
WE CAN JUST BROADEN THAT.

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:33.820
AND SO THAT YOU'RE GETTINGWHAT

01:51:33.887 --> 01:51:35.155
YOU NEED FROM A NUMBER OF

01:51:35.221 --> 01:51:37.791
DIFFERENT PEOPLE VERSUS ONE

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:39.059
MENTOR KIND OF RENT CONTROL.

01:51:39.125 --> 01:51:39.726
I THINK THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:41.094
THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT

01:51:41.161 --> 01:51:42.262
BLACK TEACHERS.

01:51:42.328 --> 01:51:43.596
NOT MORE SPECIAL NOT LESS

01:51:43.663 --> 01:51:44.597
SPECIAL TO SOMETHING SPECIAL

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:46.099
ABOUT BLACK TEACHERS

01:51:46.166 --> 01:51:47.534
PARTICULARLY BLACK MALE TEACHERS.

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.135
I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH

01:51:49.202 --> 01:51:51.905
THE STEREOTYPES IN SOCIETY SO.

01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:53.173
I'M AN UNUSUAL SUSPECT SOMEONE

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:55.075
ACTUAL OPEN CLASS WHETHER

01:51:55.141 --> 01:51:55.842
THEY'RE BLACK STUDENTS OR OTHER

01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:57.077
STUDENTS.

01:51:57.143 --> 01:52:03.183
I GET A LOOK.

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:04.284
WHO'S THIS GUY RIGHT.

01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:04.918
THAT LOOK ACTUALLY IS EXTREMELY

01:52:04.984 --> 01:52:06.086
IMPORTANT NOW THE DATA AND THE

01:52:06.152 --> 01:52:07.120
REPORTS IN THE RESEARCH AND JOHN

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:08.388
OFTEN SIMPLY.

01:52:08.455 --> 01:52:09.489
LOOKS AT THE A PRETTY INTENSIVE

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:11.191
STUDY.

01:52:11.257 --> 01:52:12.625
OF HOW DO WE GET OVER THE

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:13.626
ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:52:13.693 --> 01:52:16.096
AND SO THE DATA IS THE DATA

01:52:16.162 --> 01:52:17.797
RIGHT BLACK TEACHERS WITH BLACK

01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:19.399
STUDENTS.

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:20.467
THE QUITE LITERALLY RIGHT AND I

01:52:20.533 --> 01:52:22.969
CAN BEGIN THE DISTURBING A COPY

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:23.503
TO REPORT TO LOOK AT THE

01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:25.305
FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE TO

01:52:25.371 --> 01:52:26.306
SNIFF AGAINST THE POPULATION

01:52:26.372 --> 01:52:28.575
SIZE BECAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:30.176
LOOK AT I THINK.

01:52:30.243 --> 01:52:33.780
THAT -- ELEVATING THE TEACHING

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:36.282
PROFESSION -- IS EXTREMELY

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:38.418
IMPORTANT TO ATTRACT EVERYONE TO

01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:40.520
THE TEACHING PROFESSION -- OF

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:42.489
THIS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH -- ONE

01:52:42.555 --> 01:52:43.590
SUGGESTION THAT I MADE ABOUT

01:52:43.656 --> 01:52:45.458
STARTING STARTING TEACHERS OFF

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:47.894
AT A HIGHER SALARY STEP.

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.229
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT I THINK

01:52:49.295 --> 01:52:51.664
THAT -- ANY GOOD TEACHER A

01:52:51.731 --> 01:52:52.732
PARTICULARLY GOOD TEACHER

01:52:52.799 --> 01:52:56.536
MENTORS ARE A A DEEP VALUE TO

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:58.071
ANY TEACHER.

01:52:58.138 --> 01:53:00.507
I THINK ONE FIX AS IT RELATES TO

01:53:00.573 --> 01:53:02.175
TRYING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:03.776
BLACK TEACHERS TO BLACK TEACHER

01:53:03.843 --> 01:53:06.179
MENTORS IS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE.

01:53:06.246 --> 01:53:07.413
THE BLACK FACULTY AND STAFF

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.883
ASSOCIATION -- THE BEAUTY OF ALL

01:53:09.949 --> 01:53:11.284
THESE SOLUTIONS IS THAT IT TAKES

01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:13.319
A VILLAGE AND THEREFORE YOU NEED

01:53:13.386 --> 01:53:15.455
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS NGOS

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:17.590
SOCIAL SERVICES SO I COULD

01:53:17.657 --> 01:53:19.025
IMAGINE A CASE WHERE.

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:20.693
THE DISTRICT HAS HIRING POLICY

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:21.728
RIGHT AND INTENTIONALLY GOES

01:53:21.794 --> 01:53:24.197
AFTER AFRICAN AMERICAN TEACHERS

01:53:24.264 --> 01:53:25.298
AND THE BLACK FACULTY AND STAFF

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:26.799
ASSOCIATION WHICH SHOULD BE

01:53:26.866 --> 01:53:28.401
REPLICATED TO ALL A HUNDRED AND

01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:29.969
TWELVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.304
SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS WITHIN BE

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:33.039
THERE TO SUPPORT THEM TO GIVE

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:34.140
THEM THE INTENSIVE.

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:36.109
KIND OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

01:53:36.176 --> 01:53:38.678
THAT MAKES THEM EXPERT TEACHERS

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:40.013
AND IT MIGHT I ADD TO THE EQUITY

01:53:40.079 --> 01:53:41.314
MINDEDNESS IS WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:42.982
LOOKING AT SO YOU DON'T SO THAT

01:53:43.049 --> 01:53:44.350
EVEN A MENTOR TEACHER WHO ISN'T

01:53:44.417 --> 01:53:46.019
OF THE SAME RACE BUT IT EQUITY

01:53:46.085 --> 01:53:46.753
MIND IT.

01:53:46.819 --> 01:53:48.254
REALLY IMPACTS AND SO WHAT WE'RE

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:49.122
LOOKING AT WHEN A RECRUITMENT

01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:50.423
PRACTICES DIVERSE PEOPLE

01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:52.425
APPLICANTS AT PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:53.927
COMMITTED TO INCLUSION SOCIAL

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:58.565
JUSTICE EQUITY MINDEDNESS TO

01:53:58.631 --> 01:53:59.432
THOSE.

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:00.066
IN BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:00.700
SMALL POPULATIONS WE WE NEED TO

01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:01.334
BROADEN THE NETWORK AS WELL SO

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:02.202
THAT THOSE MENTORS ARE NOT

01:54:02.268 --> 01:54:04.704
NECESSARILY ON THE SAME CAMPUS

01:54:04.771 --> 01:54:05.138
THAT WOULD BE IDEA.

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:08.241
BUT WE WE HAVE.

01:54:08.308 --> 01:54:09.375
A SYSTEM STRUCTURE WE'RE GONNA

01:54:09.442 --> 01:54:11.211
HAVE TO OVER COME OVER TIME AND

01:54:11.277 --> 01:54:12.645
I THINK WE HAVE TO BE TO BE.

01:54:12.712 --> 01:54:15.014
AWARE OF THAT BUT ALSO SINCE WE

01:54:15.081 --> 01:54:18.017
LOCK UP UPWARDS OF 30% OF YOUNG

01:54:18.084 --> 01:54:20.053
BLACK MEN [inaudible]

01:54:20.119 --> 01:54:21.654
WHAT WE'RE?

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:23.189
MAKING THAT POOL SMALLER AND

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:25.692
SMALLER WHEN THAT BECOMES THEN A

01:54:25.758 --> 01:54:27.393
VERY HIGH VALUE COMMODITY. TO

01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.796
BRING IN AND THEN STRATEGICALLY

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:32.365
GET INTO OUR SYSTEM. TO BE ABLE

01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:33.366
TO TEACH SO THAT'S THE OTHER

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:34.934
PIECE WERE WORKING ON AND I WAS

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:36.502
GLAD YOU MENTIONED ARE.

01:54:36.569 --> 01:54:38.438
INTERESTING THAT YOU MENTION.

01:54:38.504 --> 01:54:40.006
THE PIPELINE OF TRYING TO GET

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:41.441
FOLKS OF COLOR I I CHAIR THE

01:54:41.507 --> 01:54:43.076
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN ONE OF MY

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:45.578
BIG CONCERNS RIGHT NOW IS

01:54:45.645 --> 01:54:46.045
DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:46.512
PROFESSION.

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:47.614
IT IS A VERY WHITE MALE

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.717
PROFESSION. TO OVERCOME THAT IT

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:52.018
WILL WELL WE STARTED THAT

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:53.886
INCLUDE LOOKING AT JUDICIAL

01:54:53.953 --> 01:54:54.454
RANKS.

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:55.455
BEEN LOOKING AT THE LEGAL

01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:57.357
PROFESSION THIS GOES ALL THE WAY

01:54:57.423 --> 01:54:59.559
BACK TO KIDS AND HOW WE FEEL

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:00.860
THAT PIPELINES WERE TRY TO FILL

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:02.195
PIPELINES FOR SCHOOLS.

01:55:02.262 --> 01:55:02.929
BUT ALSO TRYING TO FILL

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:04.163
PIPELINES IN VARIOUS OTHER

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:06.299
PROFESSIONS THAT ARE NOT

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:08.468
ACTUALLY DIVERSE AND THAT HAS A

01:55:08.534 --> 01:55:10.136
BIG IMPACT IT'S ONE OF THE

01:55:10.203 --> 01:55:12.672
REASONS THAT WE TEND TO WALK UP.

01:55:12.739 --> 01:55:14.207
AND SO MANY YOUNG BLACK MEN OF

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:16.509
COLOR BECAUSE THE LEGAL SYSTEM

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:18.011
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY DO YOU

01:55:18.077 --> 01:55:19.078
AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE

01:55:19.145 --> 01:55:21.114
THEY'RE COMING FROM SO WE HAVE.

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.915
VARIOUS SYSTEMSTHAT DESPERATELY

01:55:22.982 --> 01:55:24.784
DESPERATELY NEED CHANGE IF WE

01:55:24.851 --> 01:55:27.687
CAN DO THAT I THINK WE CAN START

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:29.555
TO MAKE THE NUMBERS LOOK BETTER.

01:55:29.622 --> 01:55:31.057
BUT OVER COMING BACK.

01:55:31.124 --> 01:55:33.092
IS IS ALTERNATELY A BIG

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:35.194
CHALLENGES MENTION IN BRIEF OF

01:55:35.261 --> 01:55:35.795
THAT WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE IN

01:55:35.862 --> 01:55:37.096
CALIFORNIA.

01:55:37.163 --> 01:55:38.665
YES THE KEY TO UNDERSTAND AND I

01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:39.532
KNOW LEGISLATORS HAVE BEEN

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:42.602
TALKING ABOUT REPEALS OF PROP.

01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:43.836
THIRTEEN AND LOOKING AT

01:55:43.903 --> 01:55:45.638
SERIOUSLY LOOKING AT PROP TWO OH

01:55:45.705 --> 01:55:46.239
NINE I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING

01:55:46.306 --> 01:55:47.140
TO INVESTIGATE BECAUSE

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:49.509
CALIFORNIA AGAIN USED TO BE A

01:55:49.575 --> 01:55:50.610
PARTICULAR KIND OF LEADER.

01:55:50.677 --> 01:55:52.111
WHEN IT CAME TO DIVERSITY

01:55:52.178 --> 01:55:53.346
CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:54.714
STATES WHERE ACTUALLY

01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:56.549
REPRESENTATION MATTERED MOST IN

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:58.151
ALL PROFESSIONS AND THEY WERE

01:55:58.217 --> 01:55:58.918
PIPELINE?

01:55:58.985 --> 01:56:00.420
SO I THINK TWO NINE IS WHAT IT

01:56:00.486 --> 01:56:03.623
IS BUT I DO THINK THAT WE CAN DO

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:05.358
SOMETHING MORE INTENTIONAL AS A

01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:06.959
STATE TO REALLY FOCUS ON HIGH

01:56:07.026 --> 01:56:10.863
VALUE INDIVIDUALS IF WE KNOW THE

01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:11.964
BLACK MALE TEACHERS.

01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:13.166
ACCORDING TO JOHN HOPKINS STUDY

01:56:13.232 --> 01:56:13.766
INCREASES NOT ALL OF THE TEST

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:15.234
SCORES BUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:16.602
STUDENTS WILL ACTUALLY GRADUATE

01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:17.870
AND WE NEED TO VALUE THOSE MEN

01:56:17.937 --> 01:56:19.339
THAT ARE LOCKED UP IN PRISON AS

01:56:19.405 --> 01:56:20.940
TEACHERS.

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:22.442
WE CAN CHANGE OUR FRAME.

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:24.143
THAT THESE ARE FUTURE TEACHERS

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:26.112
AND THEN AGAIN WORK WITH C. R.

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:28.614
C. AND C. R. C. -- TO FOCUS ON

01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:31.250
EDUCATION PROGRAMS RIGHT IN

01:56:31.317 --> 01:56:32.985
PARTICULAR IN PRISON WHEN THEY

01:56:33.052 --> 01:56:34.687
CAN'T GET THE KIND OF PRE

01:56:34.754 --> 01:56:36.322
SERVICE DISTRICT IN TURN SERVICE

01:56:36.389 --> 01:56:37.123
I KNOW.

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:39.258
IT MAY SEEM LIKE A PHENOMENAL TO

01:56:39.325 --> 01:56:41.160
SAY HEY A FORMER FELON IS NOW IN

01:56:41.227 --> 01:56:44.630
THE DISTRICT INTERN PROGRAM BUT

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:45.231
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED.

01:56:45.298 --> 01:56:47.233
IT ABSOLUTELY IS AND AND THIS IS

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:49.035
YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THIS AUDIENCE

01:56:49.102 --> 01:56:51.704
AND THAT THE MAKE UP OF THE

01:56:51.771 --> 01:56:53.439
RACIAL MAKEUP OF IT IS IS.

01:56:53.506 --> 01:56:54.841
A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN A LOT OF

01:56:54.907 --> 01:56:56.209
THE OTHER COMMITTEE HEARING SOME

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:57.510
THINGS IT AND WE HAVE TALKED

01:56:57.577 --> 01:57:00.279
OURSELVES OUT OF TALKING ABOUT.

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:01.881
REYES WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:57:01.948 --> 01:57:03.916
POLICY PROP TWO NINE AND OTHERS

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:05.218
I THINK OR THAT WOULD WHEN WE

01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:06.586
STOP TALKING ABOUT RACE THE

01:57:06.652 --> 01:57:07.653
RACES SWEAT.

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.322
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:10.523
AND WE HAVE TALKED HERSELF INTO

01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:11.624
THAT THAT WE HAVE SOLVED THAT

01:57:11.691 --> 01:57:13.960
PROBLEM AND WE HAVE IT IN USE GO

01:57:14.026 --> 01:57:15.328
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:57:15.395 --> 01:57:17.063
THAT ARE STRUGGLING AND YOU CAN

01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:18.998
SEE THAT VERY APPARENTLY AND YET

01:57:19.065 --> 01:57:20.133
WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR ADDED TO

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:21.467
QUITE A BIT ABOUT.

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:22.935
WHO WERE GOING TO ACCEPT WE HAD

01:57:23.002 --> 01:57:24.604
DEBATE AROUND JURORS WE HAD

01:57:24.670 --> 01:57:26.139
DEBATE AROUND HIM AND AND WHO'S

01:57:26.205 --> 01:57:27.306
ALLOWED TO SERVE AS A JUROR

01:57:27.373 --> 01:57:28.641
WHO'S ALLOWED TO VOTE?

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:31.511
AND WHY WE ARE EXCLUDING VERY

01:57:31.577 --> 01:57:33.479
LARGE PARTS OF SIGNIFICANT

01:57:33.546 --> 01:57:36.149
PIECES OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:38.084
AS WE CREATE THOSE POLICIES AND

01:57:38.151 --> 01:57:39.719
THAT'S ALL A PIECE OF THAT WHO'S

01:57:39.786 --> 01:57:41.621

TRYING TO PROMOTE WHAT

01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:45.591
HISTORICALLY PEOPLE WHO APPLY

01:57:45.658 --> 01:57:46.759
FOR POSITIONS COULD AND IF THEY

01:57:46.826 --> 01:57:48.027
HAD FELONY CONVICTIONS RIGHT SO

01:57:48.094 --> 01:57:48.227
THAT.

01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:49.495

IN THE PIPELINE AND TEACHING

01:57:52.131 --> 01:57:52.865
CURRENTLY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T

01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:54.233
EVEN HAVE ACCESS WHEN YOU WALK

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:58.371
UP 30% OF THAT POTENTIAL POOL

01:57:58.438 --> 01:58:00.139

GET YOU INTO THE REALM OF THIS

01:58:22.495 --> 01:58:25.031
MYSTERY OF THE HUMAN CHEMISTRY.

THIS HEARING I'LL JUST POINT OUT.

01:58:29.135 --> 01:58:31.204

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:36.676
NEEDS TO SEE PEOPLE THAT THEY

01:58:36.742 --> 01:58:39.479

LOTS OF KIDS COULD GO TO SCHOOL

01:58:43.883 --> 01:58:45.618
SEE BILL THEY WOULD IDENTIFY BUT

01:58:45.685 --> 01:58:47.353
FOR THIS POPULATION.

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:48.621

WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.355
DISCUSSION THIS IS.

02:02:09.422 --> 02:02:11.023
I I DON'T KNOW IF THE

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:12.324
BUREAUCRACY THAT.

02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:14.260

SO HOW DO YOU YEAH HOW YOU WORK

02:02:16.228 --> 02:02:17.096
WITH THAT.

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:18.130
MEASURE JUST WANT TO MENTION

02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:19.665
BRIEFLY THAT THERE IS A PUBLIC

02:02:19.732 --> 02:02:21.133
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND SEE

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:22.334
ISSUED NORTHRIDGE WITH THE

02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:24.203
DEPUTY CAL UP TO BE K. KELLOGG

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:25.204
FOUNDATION.

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:27.707
IS A MINORITY TEACHER PROJECT I

02:02:27.773 --> 02:02:29.375
THINK THAT'S EXEMPLARY I WON

02:02:29.442 --> 02:02:30.843
BECAUSE IT'S IN THE CSU SYSTEM

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:32.311
IN THE CSU DOES SO MUCH TO

02:02:32.378 --> 02:02:33.913
EDUCATE ONE IN EIGHT EDUCATORS

02:02:33.979 --> 02:02:35.481
IN TEACHING CALIFORNIA.

02:02:35.548 --> 02:02:37.283
HAVE COME FROM THE C. ISSUE AND

02:02:37.349 --> 02:02:38.417
THEY ARE NOW INTENTIONALLY

02:02:38.484 --> 02:02:40.486
WORKING WITH ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE

02:02:40.553 --> 02:02:42.421
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:02:42.488 --> 02:02:45.191
DOLLARS FOR THREE YEAR --

02:02:45.257 --> 02:02:47.226
PROGRAM AND NOT ENOUGH MONEY BUT

02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:48.427
THEY'RE DOING IT ANYWAY AND

02:02:48.494 --> 02:02:51.597
THEY'VE GOT TO GET IN THE DEBATE

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:52.164
QUE KELLOGG FOUNDATION IS IN

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:53.199
MICHIGAN.

02:02:53.265 --> 02:02:54.400
THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT

02:02:54.467 --> 02:02:57.436
I THINK ARE BAKED INTO THE PRE

02:02:57.503 --> 02:02:58.404
SERVICE AND DISTRICT IN TURN

02:02:58.471 --> 02:03:01.107
PROCESS BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE TO

02:03:01.173 --> 02:03:02.641
AFTER THEY GO TO THE PRE SERVICE

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:04.009
AND IS AGAIN TERM PROCESS.

02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:05.244
THEY DO HAVE TO PASS PARTICULAR

02:03:05.311 --> 02:03:06.946
TESTS RIGHT THEY DO HAVE TO DO

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:08.314
SOMETHING IN BETWEEN.

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.182
AND SO HAVING A CONVERSATION

02:03:10.249 --> 02:03:12.485
WITH EXPERTS LIKE THE CSU

02:03:12.551 --> 02:03:14.153
EDUCATION EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.154
PROGRAMS.

02:03:15.221 --> 02:03:20.192
AROUND FIGURING OUT HOW -- THE

02:03:20.259 --> 02:03:22.027
THE FREE SERVICE AND DISTRICT IN

02:03:22.094 --> 02:03:25.464
TURN SERVICE CAN TURN INTO -- AN

02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:26.766
ACTUAL FULL TIME JOB NOW WHEN

02:03:26.832 --> 02:03:27.967
THEY BECOME DISTRICT INTERNS

02:03:28.033 --> 02:03:29.301
THEY'RE ACTUALLY PLACED.

02:03:29.368 --> 02:03:31.704
IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT -- WILL

02:03:31.771 --> 02:03:33.472
THEY STAY THAT'S BASED UPON WHAT

02:03:33.539 --> 02:03:35.374
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN TERMS OF

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:36.742
COMPLETING THE REQUIREMENTS IN

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:38.244
ORDER TO BE A FULLY CERTIFIED

02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.944
TEACHER.

02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:40.679
BUT I THINK THAT CONVERSATION IN

02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:42.515
YOUR THAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE NOT

02:03:42.581 --> 02:03:44.049
JUST A ONE OFF.

02:03:44.116 --> 02:03:45.551
IT'S A SYSTEM WIDE ISSUE AND I

02:03:45.618 --> 02:03:47.052
THINK THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT

02:03:47.119 --> 02:03:48.254
IS TO GET A SYSTEM WIDE

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.488
ORGANIZATION LIKE SEE ISSUE

02:03:49.555 --> 02:03:50.589
ENGAGED.

02:03:50.656 --> 02:03:52.158
WITH THE EXPERTS THAT ARE THERE

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:53.959
TO REALLY FOCUS ON HOW DO WE

02:03:54.026 --> 02:03:57.930
CREATE THAT KIND OF VALUE ADDED

02:03:57.997 --> 02:03:58.531
KNOWING THAT.

02:03:58.597 --> 02:04:00.332
AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE TEACHER

02:04:00.399 --> 02:04:02.201
TEACHING MATH CALCULUS SCIENCE

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:04.003
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FOR

02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:05.304
SERIOUS ABOUT STEM AND STEAM.

02:04:05.371 --> 02:04:06.772
AND I THINK SEE ISSUE WITH WOULD

02:04:06.839 --> 02:04:08.107
BE THE PERFECT PARTNER TO THINK

02:04:08.174 --> 02:04:09.708
THROUGH HOW DO WE VALUE AFRICAN

02:04:09.775 --> 02:04:10.709
AMERICAN MEN.

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:12.178
THAT ARE TEACHERS THAT WANT TO

02:04:12.244 --> 02:04:12.978
COME INTO THE TEACHING

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:14.547
PROFESSION NOT JUST LOOTED COULD

02:04:22.054 --> 02:04:23.322

GAP.

02:11:24.943 --> 02:11:26.044
THERE IS NO REASON WHY THIS

02:11:26.111 --> 02:11:27.145
SELECT COMMITTEE CAN'T DO THE

02:11:27.212 --> 02:11:29.114

02:11:29.181 --> 02:11:30.482
AS FAR AS TEACHER RECRUITMENT IS

02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:32.217
CONCERNED WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:46.898
BUT THEY WILL SPECIFICALLY FOCUS

02:11:46.965 --> 02:11:49.201
ON BLACK STUDENTS TO ENCOURAGE

02:11:49.268 --> 02:11:50.902
THEM TO BECOME TEACHERS.

02:11:50.969 --> 02:11:52.571
WE ALSO RECOMMEND CULTIVATING

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:54.072
ALLIANCES WITH HISTORICALLY

02:11:54.139 --> 02:11:56.375

THE COST OF LIVING IN THE STATE

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:07.185
THIS SELECT COMMITTEE SHOULD

02:12:07.252 --> 02:12:08.887
OFFER HOUSING SUPPORT.

02:12:08.954 --> 02:12:11.056
AS LONG AS THE POTENTIAL TEACHER

UNIVERSITY ECONOMIST FOUND THAT

02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:27.739
HAVING JUST ONE BLACK TEACHER IN

02:12:27.806 --> 02:12:29.074
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SIGNIFICANTLY

02:12:29.141 --> 02:12:30.909

VERY LOW INCOME BOYS THE RISK OF

02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:43.221
DROPPING OUT WAS REDUCED BY 939%.

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:44.723

I WAS THINKING THAT REFLECT THE

02:15:03.195 --> 02:15:05.297
EARLIER ABOUT.

02:15:05.363 --> 02:15:07.299
IF I'VE EVER HAD A BLACK TEACHER.

02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:08.934
IN MY EDUCATIONAL CAREER I DON'T

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.402
HAVE A BLACK TEACHER AND TAUGHT

02:15:10.469 --> 02:15:12.003
WITH IN TENTH GRADE.

02:15:12.070 --> 02:15:14.206
OF FEMALE WHO ACTUALLY INSPIRED

02:15:14.272 --> 02:15:15.540
ME TO BE A TEACHER JUST FOR HER

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:18.043
SHOWING UP. TO ALL WHITE SCHOOL

02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:19.611
THEY DIDN'T WANT HER TO BE THERE

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:21.513
TEACHING ENGLISH AND THAT WAS

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:23.148
REALLY INSPIRING TO ME HER

02:15:23.215 --> 02:15:24.082
COURAGE.

02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.850
AND THEN I DIDN'T HAVE A BLACK

02:15:24.916 --> 02:15:29.955
MALE TEACHER AND SO GRAD SCHOOL.

02:15:30.021 --> 02:15:31.423
OF THE FIRST HARPER SAW BLACK NO

02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:33.225
TEACHER -- IN MY CAREER I TEACH

02:15:33.291 --> 02:15:34.893
KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE AND

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.127
SECOND GRADE SO WHEN I SHOW UP

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:37.996
THE KIDS ARE EXCITED KIDS

02:15:38.063 --> 02:15:39.764
RUNNING DOWN THE HALL CABIN YOUR

02:15:39.831 --> 02:15:41.233
CLASSROOM.

02:15:41.299 --> 02:15:42.434
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS BECAUSE

02:15:42.501 --> 02:15:43.034
I WAS A BLACK MALE THEY HAD

02:15:43.101 --> 02:15:43.668
NEVER SEEN A BLACK MALE TEACHER

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:45.003
BEFORE [inaudible]

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:46.438
SO.

02:15:46.505 --> 02:15:47.906
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME TO

02:15:47.973 --> 02:15:49.407
BE IN THE BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT

02:15:49.474 --> 02:15:50.308
BEING A ROLE MODEL FOR THOSE

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:51.977
STUDENTS AND SHOWING THEM THAT

02:15:52.043 --> 02:15:53.612
THERE IS.

02:15:53.678 --> 02:15:55.213
PURPOSE AND VALUE IN BEING AS IN

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:57.449
EDUCATION AND THAT THEY COULD BE

02:15:57.516 --> 02:16:00.318
TEACHER THAT THEY WANT TO BE --

02:16:00.385 --> 02:16:02.587
YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT TO ASK

02:16:02.654 --> 02:16:03.221
IF YOU GAVE ME A BLANK CHECK AND

02:16:03.288 --> 02:16:05.023
I COULD.

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:06.791
ASK YOU FOR ANYTHING

02:16:06.858 --> 02:16:07.092
[inaudible]

02:16:07.158 --> 02:16:10.962
I I ONE OF THE THINGS I'M PROUD

02:16:11.029 --> 02:16:11.530
OF IS I'M PART OF THE BLACK

02:16:11.596 --> 02:16:13.231
TEACHER PROJECT AND WHAT WE DO

02:16:13.298 --> 02:16:15.133
IS AFFINITY SPACE.

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:16.701
OF PROGRAM FUNDED BY DOCTOR

02:16:16.768 --> 02:16:18.136
MISTER MOSELY -- IN NEW YORK

02:16:18.203 --> 02:16:18.737
CITY.

02:16:18.803 --> 02:16:21.273
IS SHE HAVE TWO CHAPTERS HERE IN

02:16:21.339 --> 02:16:22.307
THE BAY AREA ONE IN SAN

02:16:22.374 --> 02:16:23.575
FRANCISCO ONE IN OAKLAND

02:16:23.642 --> 02:16:24.276
CALIFORNIA.

02:16:24.342 --> 02:16:26.044
IS SHE BRINGS TOGETHER BLACK

02:16:26.111 --> 02:16:27.979
TEACHERS FROM ALL OVER THE BAY

02:16:28.046 --> 02:16:32.951
AREA TO DEEPEN OUR SKILLS AND TO

02:16:33.018 --> 02:16:34.352
THINK DEEPLY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

02:16:34.419 --> 02:16:36.054
DOING IN THE CLASSROOM AND HOW

02:16:36.121 --> 02:16:37.923
WE CAN ELEVATE BLACK CHILDREN.

02:16:37.989 --> 02:16:40.792
FROM PRE K. TO CAN FOR A PRE K.

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:42.661
TWELVE GRADE.

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:44.362
AND HOW WE CAN.

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:45.630
THE CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENTGAP

02:16:45.697 --> 02:16:47.065
BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE

02:16:47.132 --> 02:16:48.500
CLASSROOM.

02:16:48.567 --> 02:16:49.768
ALSO THE WAY TO HELP RETAIN

02:16:49.834 --> 02:16:51.102
BLACK TEACHERS UNTIL THAT

02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:53.305
PROJECT I HAD NEVER SEEN MORE

02:16:53.371 --> 02:16:56.207
THAN THREE BLACK TEACHERS AT ONE

02:16:56.274 --> 02:16:57.876
TIME IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT.

02:16:57.943 --> 02:16:59.744
SO WHEN TWENTY TEACHERS SO THAT

02:16:59.811 --> 02:17:00.378
THEY'RE ALL BLACK IT WAS LIKE

02:17:00.445 --> 02:17:02.414
WOW.

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:03.248
WERE FAMILY.

02:17:03.315 --> 02:17:04.282
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE

02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:07.586
HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING FUNDING.

02:17:07.652 --> 02:17:09.087
FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS WE

02:17:09.154 --> 02:17:10.655
HAVE TO BIG.

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:12.223
RIGHT ALL TYPES OF GRANTS AND WE

02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:14.059
MAY GET A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:17:14.125 --> 02:17:15.860
DOLLARS OR FIFTY THOUSAND

02:17:15.927 --> 02:17:16.928
DOLLARS.

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:18.730
IF SO WE CAN'T PAY TEACHERS FOR

02:17:18.797 --> 02:17:21.366
THEIR TIME TO COME AFTER SCHOOL

02:17:21.433 --> 02:17:22.834
TO BE A PART OF THESE GROUPS.

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:24.336
SO IF I COULD ASK FOR ANYTHING

02:17:24.402 --> 02:17:25.804
IT WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE

02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:27.305
FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF

02:17:27.372 --> 02:17:28.306
PROGRAMS THAT KEEP.

02:17:28.373 --> 02:17:30.442
BLACK TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOMS

02:17:30.508 --> 02:17:32.110
IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:17:32.177 --> 02:17:34.145
THE OTHER THING IS I WOULD ASK

02:17:34.212 --> 02:17:35.647
THAT WE COULD.

02:17:35.714 --> 02:17:38.383
INCLUDE MORE BLACK MALE TEACHERS

02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:39.784
IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS.

02:17:39.851 --> 02:17:42.320
WE'RE NOT ALWAYS IN THE ROOM

02:17:42.387 --> 02:17:43.088
WHEN THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS

02:17:43.154 --> 02:17:44.656
ABOUT US AND FOR US IN THE

02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:46.324
CLASSROOM SO GIVEN US MORE

02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:48.693
OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE DECISIONS.

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.895
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS.

02:17:50.962 --> 02:17:52.731
IN THE OTHER THING WOULD BE.

02:17:52.797 --> 02:17:53.698
MENTOR SHIP.

02:17:53.765 --> 02:17:55.000
WE ARE WE HAVE THE BEGINNING

02:17:55.066 --> 02:17:56.067
TEACHER PROGRAM AND WE HAVE SO

02:17:56.134 --> 02:17:58.403
THE OTHER STATE PROGRAMS WE

02:17:58.470 --> 02:18:00.672
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SPECIFIC. TO

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:02.674
BLACK TEACHERS.

02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:03.975
OR TEACHERS OF COLOR BECAUSE WE

02:18:04.042 --> 02:18:05.410
HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS.

02:18:05.477 --> 02:18:06.678
WE HAVE DIFFERENT STRUGGLES AND

02:18:06.745 --> 02:18:08.380
WE NEED SOMEONE THAT CAN COME IN

02:18:08.446 --> 02:18:10.081
AND HELP US.

02:18:10.148 --> 02:18:12.050
NAVIGATE THOSE SYSTEMS

02:18:12.117 --> 02:18:13.385
ESPECIALLY FROM A PERSON OF

02:18:13.451 --> 02:18:15.353
COLOR AS POINT OF VIEW.

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:16.421
SO THOSE WOULD BE THE THINGS I

02:18:16.488 --> 02:18:17.288
WOULD ASK.

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:19.190
FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU -- AND

02:18:19.257 --> 02:18:19.924
IT MIGHT.

02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:24.295
NOT JUST QUICKLY -- JUST MENTION

02:18:24.362 --> 02:18:26.097
IS MIKE MY COLLEAGUES REMINDED

02:18:26.164 --> 02:18:27.532
ME THAT AND IN PART AS MAY BE

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:30.168
CONNECTING -- TEACHERS AND

02:18:30.235 --> 02:18:33.405
SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE WE WE

02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:33.972
WE WERE PUTTING MONEY IN THE

02:18:34.039 --> 02:18:36.608
BUDGET. FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM

02:18:36.675 --> 02:18:38.343
FOR THINGS OF THIS NATURE.

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:40.445
AND THEN I'LL GO BACK TO MY

02:18:40.512 --> 02:18:42.614
DISTRICT AND SOMEONE CARILLO SAY

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:44.416
WILL GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICT AND

02:18:44.482 --> 02:18:46.051
ASK FOR THAT IN A ROW WHAT DID

02:18:46.117 --> 02:18:47.252

02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:49.587
AND WE'LL FIND THE DUE DATE HAS

02:18:49.654 --> 02:18:49.988
PASSED.

02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:53.825
I MEAN IT DIRT THERE IS MONEY

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:54.459

02:18:55.393 --> 02:18:56.094
AND I'VE HAD.

02:18:56.161 --> 02:18:57.162

CHURCHES FIND OUT AFTER THE DUE

02:18:58.897 --> 02:19:00.031
DATE AND THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN

02:19:00.098 --> 02:19:04.402
YOU KNOW FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS --

02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:06.204
BE HUGE.

02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:07.572
TO SOME DISTRICTS TO TO START A

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:08.873
PROGRAM AND SO WE PROBABLY NEED

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:11.042
TO ALSO DO A BETTER JOB OF OF

02:19:11.109 --> 02:19:13.311
CONNECTING.

02:19:13.378 --> 02:19:14.979
YOU WITH WHAT THE RESOURCES

02:19:15.046 --> 02:19:18.416
THERE ARE A OUT THERE -- BECAUSE

02:19:18.483 --> 02:19:21.152
I I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT

02:19:21.219 --> 02:19:23.588
OF MISSED OPPORTUNITIES GOING ON

02:19:23.655 --> 02:19:26.825
THREE ACES PROGRAM.

02:19:26.891 --> 02:19:27.926
GOOD. FOR THE THE THINKING AS

02:19:27.992 --> 02:19:29.728
CHAIR AND AND TO THAT SAME POINT --

02:19:29.794 --> 02:19:30.395
EVEN IN THE DEAD BUT THE

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:32.130
DISTRICTS THAT DO APPLYING GET

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:33.364
FUNDING ARE THE RIGHT

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:33.865
ADMINISTRATORS IN THOSE

02:19:33.932 --> 02:19:35.900
DISTRICTS MAKING THE RIGHT

02:19:35.967 --> 02:19:37.268
DECISION ABOUT THAT MONEY.

02:19:37.335 --> 02:19:37.802
OR THEY JUST PUTTING INTO

02:19:37.869 --> 02:19:38.636
PROGRAMS THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS PUT

02:19:38.703 --> 02:19:39.471
INTO.

02:19:39.537 --> 02:19:41.539
AND AND HOW MUCH ACCOUNTABILITY

02:19:41.606 --> 02:19:43.908
IS THERE FOR THAT MONEY BECAUSE

02:19:43.975 --> 02:19:44.542
CERTAINLY A LOT OF MONEY COMES

02:19:44.609 --> 02:19:47.712
DOWN -- WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT

02:19:47.779 --> 02:19:49.247
MEANS PROGRESS COMING UP AND AND

02:19:49.314 --> 02:19:50.715
HAS A REALLY GOING TO THE

02:19:50.782 --> 02:19:52.517
STUDENTS THAT NEED IT.

02:19:52.584 --> 02:19:55.887
AND AN ON THE SPOT BECAUSE FOR A

02:19:55.954 --> 02:19:56.755
VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE YOU

HIGH SCHOOL.

02:20:02.026 --> 02:20:03.561

02:20:18.209 --> 02:20:18.877

STUDENTS AND THEY DEFINITELY

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:21.546
FELT LOVED AND I THINK THAT'S A

02:20:21.613 --> 02:20:21.913
BIG PART OF IT.

02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:22.947
IS TO FEEL APPRECIATED AND AND

02:20:23.014 --> 02:20:23.782
WHEN I WOULD COME TO TO THE

02:20:23.848 --> 02:20:30.421

THERE'S ONLY SO MANY OF YOU TO

02:20:34.626 --> 02:20:36.161
GO AROUND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO

02:20:36.227 --> 02:20:37.362

THAT COMES IN FROM FOUNDATIONS

02:20:46.704 --> 02:20:48.039

02:21:59.177 --> 02:22:00.311
CREATE THE CREATE.

02:22:00.378 --> 02:22:05.984
THE THE THE THE THE BELIEF AND

02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:08.086
AND I REMEMBER.

02:22:08.152 --> 02:22:09.187
ACTUALLY GOES BLACK KITCHEN

02:22:09.254 --> 02:22:10.521

02:22:33.845 --> 02:22:35.647
DâN TO SCALE IT.

I MEAN SENATE COMMITTEE IS.

02:22:46.257 --> 02:22:47.892
THE BECAUSE THIS CONVERSATION AS

02:22:47.959 --> 02:22:48.559

WHERE.

02:23:08.046 --> 02:23:09.514
BUT NOT AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:10.715
NOT AS A STATE.

02:23:10.782 --> 02:23:11.683

02:27:13.090 --> 02:27:14.759
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW CRITICAL THE

02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:16.561
CRITICAL ROLE THAT THEY PLAY --

02:27:16.627 --> 02:27:18.429
AND ENSURING THAT KIDS ARE SAFE

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:19.764
THAT FAMILIES FEEL LIKE THEIR

02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:21.632
KIDS ARE SAFE AT SCHOOL.

02:27:21.699 --> 02:27:23.100
CHILD CARE IS INCREDIBLY

02:27:23.167 --> 02:27:24.936
EXPENSIVE AND SO THESE PROGRAMS

02:27:25.002 --> 02:27:26.337
OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:27.371
CHILDREN TO SAY AT SCHOOL IN A

02:27:27.438 --> 02:27:28.539
SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

MATHEMATICS AND STEM

02:27:32.376 --> 02:27:35.079
OPPORTUNITIES SO WE HAVE AN AN

02:27:35.146 --> 02:27:36.714
ADDITIONAL -- INCREASE IN THE

02:27:36.781 --> 02:27:38.649
BUDGET OF FIFTY MILLION THAT

02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:39.283
WE'RE HOPING THAT THE GOVERNOR

02:27:39.350 --> 02:27:41.052
SIGNS AND THIS IS WHERE YOU ALL

02:27:41.118 --> 02:27:42.220
PLAY A ROLE.

02:27:42.286 --> 02:27:44.121
IN ENSURING THAT.

02:27:44.188 --> 02:27:46.424

SALARY INCREASES ACROSS THE

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:01.305
STATE AND I THINK THAT'S A

02:28:01.372 --> 02:28:02.673
THAT'S A WAY IN WHICH WE WORK

02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:04.675

DISCUSSION ABOUT LATINOS IN IN

02:29:32.029 --> 02:29:33.864
IN IN EDUCATION IN DOING THAT.

02:29:33.931 --> 02:29:35.900
AND AND I I PUT IT THIS WAY MY

02:29:35.966 --> 02:29:38.836
DISTRICT -- I HAVE A A SCHOOLS

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:40.671

02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:53.784
NINE LATINO.

02:29:53.851 --> 02:29:55.019
WHAT THE HECK ARE THEY DOING

02:29:55.086 --> 02:29:57.221
OVER HERE WHAT IS THIS PRINCIPLE

02:29:57.288 --> 02:29:59.090
DOING OVER HERE?

02:29:59.156 --> 02:30:02.126
WAS IS LATINA DOING -- HERE.

TO THIS SITE TEAM IS NOT DOING

02:30:03.361 --> 02:30:04.028
OR VICE VERSA.

02:30:04.095 --> 02:30:05.629
SO I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:30:05.696 --> 02:30:06.564
LEADERSHIP.

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:07.998
AND SO MAYBE THAT COULD BE PART

02:30:08.065 --> 02:30:10.835
OF OUR DISCUSSION NEXT TIME.

02:30:10.901 --> 02:30:12.636
BECAUSE IT GOES TO WHAT THE

02:30:12.703 --> 02:30:13.671
SCHOOL BOARD YOU DON'T KNOW

02:30:13.738 --> 02:30:14.705
WHERE THAT HOW THAT MONEY OF GET

02:30:14.772 --> 02:30:15.806
DISBURSED TO DANNY GOES TO

02:30:15.873 --> 02:30:17.441
PRINCIPLE DAY THEN MAKE A

02:30:17.508 --> 02:30:19.009
DECISION.

02:30:19.076 --> 02:30:20.644
AND WE ALL WE CAN DO IS JUST

02:30:20.711 --> 02:30:22.079
SEND THE MONEY THAT.

02:30:22.146 --> 02:30:23.514
ALL WE CAN DO IT JUST TO THE

02:30:23.581 --> 02:30:24.749
POLICY AND THEN SEND IT DOWN.

02:30:24.815 --> 02:30:26.851
WE GOT HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION

02:30:26.917 --> 02:30:28.652
ABOUT WHO UTILIZING.

02:30:28.719 --> 02:30:32.089
THESE BONDS. TO THE FULLEST.

02:30:32.156 --> 02:30:34.058
BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF AT THE

02:30:34.125 --> 02:30:35.559
END OF THE DAY WHETHER.

02:30:35.626 --> 02:30:37.461
YOUR PROGRAM IS IS FOR AFTER

02:30:37.528 --> 02:30:38.596
AMERICANS.

02:30:38.662 --> 02:30:41.165
I THINK THE SAME PRINCIPLES WILL

02:30:41.232 --> 02:30:44.135
WORK WELL. FOR TEEN ONLY.

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:47.538
API NATIVE AMERICANS SAY IF IT

02:30:47.605 --> 02:30:50.107
DOESN'T IT'S ALL TRANSFERABLE

02:30:50.174 --> 02:30:51.242
THAT'S RIGHT AND AND SO -- HOW

02:30:51.308 --> 02:30:52.676
DO WE TRANSFER WHAT WE TALK

02:30:52.743 --> 02:30:54.412
ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME HOW DO

02:30:54.478 --> 02:30:55.713
WE TRANSFERRED THIS?

02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:57.014
SUCCESS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

02:30:57.081 --> 02:30:58.983
THIS ARGUMENT BETWEEN CHARTER IN

02:30:59.049 --> 02:31:03.621
PUBLIC ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:06.157
BOTH ARE HAVING SUCCESSES BUT

02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:07.191
THEY'RE NOT PULLING ALL TO GET

02:31:07.258 --> 02:31:07.358
IT.

02:31:07.425 --> 02:31:08.893
IT IT DRIVES US CRAZY I WILL

02:31:08.959 --> 02:31:09.727
TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW IT

02:31:09.794 --> 02:31:10.161
DRIVES.

02:31:10.227 --> 02:31:13.097
ALL OF US HERE AND NOT.

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:14.999
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE ANSWER

02:31:15.065 --> 02:31:15.966
IS THERE.

02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:17.701
BUT IT'S NOT WE DON'T KNOW HOW

02:31:17.768 --> 02:31:19.103
TO MAKE IT FLORES ARE TRAINED

02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:20.571
TRAINED ADMINISTRATOR OR

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:21.539
SOMETHING.

02:31:21.605 --> 02:31:23.974
AND SO MAYBE WE THEIR NEXUS THE

02:31:24.041 --> 02:31:26.010
HAVE THAT CAN HAVE THAT

02:31:26.076 --> 02:31:28.112
DISCUSSION AND THEN JUST JUST

02:31:28.179 --> 02:31:29.013
BRINGING IN MORE PEOPLE TO TALK

02:31:29.079 --> 02:31:30.981
ABOUT.

02:31:31.048 --> 02:31:33.184
EVEN NATIVE AMERICANS.

02:31:33.250 --> 02:31:35.820
EXACTLY THERE IT DAM NUMBERS ARE.

02:31:35.886 --> 02:31:38.422
IF YOU THINK AFTER AMERICANS AND

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:40.724
LATINOS ARE BAD.

02:31:40.791 --> 02:31:42.927
NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE STATE

02:31:42.993 --> 02:31:44.795
AND HOW WE TREAT THEM AS

02:31:44.862 --> 02:31:47.298
CRIMINAL CRIMINAL.

02:31:47.364 --> 02:31:49.033
INSTRUMENT SO IT WOULD.

02:31:49.099 --> 02:31:50.801
YES AND IS A THERE'S A COMMITTEE

02:31:50.868 --> 02:31:52.336
DOES LOOKING INTO THAT.

02:31:52.403 --> 02:31:53.904
AND SO -- I WANT TO THANK

02:31:53.971 --> 02:31:55.940
EVERYONE.

02:31:56.006 --> 02:31:58.242
THAT PARTICIPATED THAT.

02:31:58.309 --> 02:32:01.312
ADDICTIVE IS VERY EFFECTIVE --

02:32:01.378 --> 02:32:04.148
LOOKS LIKE A CHECKBOOK IS ARE

02:32:04.215 --> 02:32:05.616
YOU START TO WRITE CHECKS ON IT

02:32:05.683 --> 02:32:06.951
I'M WORK ON THAT BUT I ALSO WANT

02:32:07.017 --> 02:32:08.219
TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW EVERYONE

02:32:08.285 --> 02:32:08.819
IT'S SPOKEN EVERYBODY THAT'S

02:32:08.886 --> 02:32:09.720
HERE.

02:32:09.787 --> 02:32:10.788
CONTINUE TO GIVE HIS INPUT

02:32:10.855 --> 02:32:12.923
BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO FOLLOW UP

02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:13.891
SO WE CAN MAKE THIS TANGIBLE

02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:15.559
CADETS.

02:32:15.626 --> 02:32:16.260
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING SO

02:32:16.327 --> 02:32:18.095
AGAIN WE HAVE TO COMMITTEE THANK

02:32:18.162 --> 02:32:21.932
