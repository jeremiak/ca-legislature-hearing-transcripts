YOU ONLY SAY WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE IN SUPPORTER OPPOSITION OF THAT. I WHATEVER RATHER FOR OUR FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS AND THAT IS MR MEDINA. AND THAT IS. HOLD ON A SECOND. FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX. I DON'T A VIOLIN NUMBER ONE AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX BY MR MEDINA YOU MAY. PROCEED WHEN READY. NO. IMPETUS BEGINNING. A. FROM A. VERY. A. NOTORIOUS CASE IN IN MY DISTRICT THE TURBAN CASE THAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY. OF PARIS THAT I REPRESENT. I I WON A STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT I HAVE BEEN A. PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS. SOMEONE WHO VALUES EDUCATION AND ALL THE CHOICES THAT THERE ARE IN EDUCATION. SOMEONE WHO REALIZES THAT NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES. THAT THAT PARENTS AND STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE. AND HOW THEY EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN. I MYSELF WAS EDUCATED IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS ATTENDING. PAROCHIAL CATHOLIC SCHOOLS FOR. NINE YEARS. SO I THINK THAT MEANS THAT MY PARENTS WERE WILLING TO. SACRIFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEIR FOUR CHILDREN HAD THE KIND OF SCHOOLING THAT THEY WANTED. SO AS I PRESENT TODAY I WANNA BE CLEAR. THAT I VALUE HOME SCHOOLING THAT I DO NOT SEE THIS BILL AND ANYWAY. AS AN ATTACK ON HOME SCHOOLING I'VE ENJOYED THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WITH MY COLLEAGUES A JAMES GALLAGHER WHO HIMSELF. A HOME SCHOOLED HIS. CHILDREN. THE BILL WAS AMENDED. AFTER THOSE DISCUSSIONS. AND I I I THINK IT'S A A BETTER BILL NOW. THAN IT WAS BEFORE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH MISTER GALLAGHER. SO TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX. IN CALIFORNIA HOME SCHOOLS ARE CLASSIFIED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION KNOWN ABOUT HOMES SCHOOLS. AND THE TYPE OF PRIVATE SCHOOL PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALL PRIVATE SCHOOLS INCLUDING HOME SCHOOLS. FILED THE PRIVATE SCHOOL OUT AFFIDAVIT ANNUALLY TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. A PRIVATE SCHOOL AFFIDAVIT IS A REGISTRATION DOCUMENT. REQUIRED TO BE FILLED ANNUALLY. BY OPERATORS OF PRIVATE SCHOOL OR HOME SCHOOL. TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO VIOLATION. OF THE TRUANCY LA. INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE PRIVATE SCHOOL AFFIDAVIT. IS GEARED TOWARD AN INSTITUTION. AND AS A RESULT. WE HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION. ON THE NATURE OR THE TYPES OF PRIVATE SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND THE NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. OUTSIDE OF MAKING ASSUMPTIONS. BASED ON ENROLLMENT NUMBERS WE DO NOT HAVE THE DEFINITIVE WAY. TO KNOW THAT WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE. ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX. CLARIFIES THE DEFINITION. A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA. HELPS TO DIS AGGREGATE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE PRIVATE SCHOOL AFFIDAVIT. BY ADDING A FIELD. ON THE AFFIDAVIT THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE FILER. SELF SELECT. THE NATURE OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOL FROM A LIST OF OPTIONS. AND I THINK I YOU ALL. WILL HAVE A A COPY OF THAT AFFIDAVIT. THIS INFORMATION WOULD THEN BE ADDED TO THE DIRECTORY A PRIVATE SCHOOL. SIX OR MORE STUDENTS THAT IS ALREADY LISTED PUBLICLY. ON THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WEBSITE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS BEEN CONFUSION. ON WHETHER THE BILL. WE'LL IMPACT THE PRIVACY OF SCHOOLS. FIVE OR FEWER CHILDREN ENROLL. IT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. TO INCLUDE INFORMATION OF THOSE SCHOOLS PUBLICLY. TO MAKE THIS EXPLICITLY CLEAR. I HAVE REQUESTED AMENDMENTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. THESE AMENDMENTS INSURER. THAT ANY SCHOOL FIVE OR FEWER STUDENTS WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT. THE PUBLIC ON THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WEBSITE. I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. PRINT EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. TO MEET THE UNIQUE IS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF EACH CHILD. ALSO BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION. ON THE TYPE OF PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. SO THAT WE AS A STATE CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR OUR STUDENTS. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS DR RON REYNOLDS. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS ORGANIZATION. STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF TWENTY FOUR PRIVATE SCHOOLS SERVICE AGENCIES. AND ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS THAT SERVE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PRIVATE SCHOOLS. ENROLLING ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IN GRADES K. THROUGH TWELVE. I'M ALSO JOINED BY JEFF BACA. CHIEF GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS OFFICER FOR THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. BUT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON. RON REYNOLDS CAP SO. WE ARE APPROACHING THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LANDMARK U. S. SUPREME COURT DECISION IN PIERCE VERSUS SOCIETY OF SISTERS. THE DECISION THAT FIRMLY ESTABLISHES THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF PARENTS TO DIRECT THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN. IN ITS UNANIMOUS RULING THE COURT DECLARED. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEORY OF LIBERTY UPON WHICH ALL GOVERNMENTS OF THIS UNION REST. EXCLUDES ANY GENERAL POWER OF THE STATE. STANDARDIZE ITS CHILDREN BY FORCING THEM TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTION FROM PUBLIC TEACHERS ONLY. CHILD IS NOT THE MERE CREATURE OF THE STATE. THOSE TO NURTURE HIM AND DIRECT HIS DESTINY HAVE THE RIGHT COUPLED WITH THE HIGH DUTY. TO RECOGNIZE AND PREPARE HIM FOR ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS. HOWEVER. THE RULING. CONTAINED ON ADDITIONAL FINDING THAT IS NO LESS SIGNIFICANT AND I QUOTE. NO QUESTION IS RAISED CONCERNING THE POWER OF THE STATE. REASONABLY TO REGULATE ALL SCHOOLS TO INSPECT. SUPERVISE AND EXAMINE THEM THEIR TEACHERS AND PUPILS. TO REQUIRE THAT ALL CHILDREN OF PROPER AGE ATTEND SOME SCHOOL. THAT TEACHERS BE OF GOOD MORAL CHARACTER AND PATRIOTIC DISPOSITION THAT CERTAIN STUDIES PLAINLY ESSENTIAL TO GOOD CITIZENSHIP MUST BE TAUGHT. AND THAT NOTHING BE TAUGHT WHICH IS MANIFESTLY INIMICAL. THE PUBLIC WELFARE. ONE CANNOT UPHOLD ONE TENET WHILE IGNORING OR REJECTING THE OTHER. BOTH PARENTS AND THE STATE POSSESS RIGHTS THAT MUST BE BALANCED THROUGH COOPERATIVE EFFORTS. SEE THAT REGULATION IS REASONABLE. I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT SUCH A BALANCE HAS LONG BEEN MAINTAINED IN CALIFORNIA. AND I BELIEVE THAT AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX THE BILL BEFORE YOU IS NOTHING IF NOT REASONABLE. OUR SCHOOLS ARE PRIVATE. THEY'RE NOT SECRET. WE ARE HAPPY TO DISCLOSE OUR ESSENTIAL NATURE TO THE PUBLIC. AND WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMEMBERS AND STAFF. JEFF BACA WITH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION REPRESENTING. RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS DR JUDY WHITE. THIS IS NOT NORMALLY AN ISSUE THAT WE WOULD ENGAGE AND. AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION DO NOT HAVE STATUTORY ROLE IN EITHER THE ESTABLISHMENT OR THE OVERSIGHT OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ISSUE REAP RESULTED FROM THE. TURPIN CASE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA REFERENCED. AND VERY QUICKLY WE. HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUR PARTNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THIS MORNING TO FIND OUT WHAT WERE THAT RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO OVERSIGHT OF HOME SCHOOLS THAT WERE PRIVATE SCHOOLS. WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING. WE'VE CONTINUED TO PLAY A ROLE AS THE MONTHS HAVE INTERCEDED IN WORKING WITH HE COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEYS FOR THE CHILDREN. AS WELL AS THE COURT APPOINTED PUBLIC GUARDIAN IN ORDER TO. IDENTIFY OPTIONS FOR A SOUND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR THESE CHILDREN MANY OF WHOM ARE NOW ADULTS SO IT HAS PROVEN TO BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE. WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO THAT BY STATUTE. WE'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE WE FELT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IN WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AS WE TALKS TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ANSWER THE INQUIRIES THAT WE ARE GETTING FROM. OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ABOUT THE ROLLS OF DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AVE BECAME CLEAR TO US THAT THERE ARE SOME GAPS IN THE INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE. AND IN SOME INSTANCES YOU HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE CASE WHERE. A SCHOOL ATTENDANCE REVIEW THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR SCHOOL ATTENDANCE REVIEW WONDER STATUTE DOES PLAY A VERY SMALL ROLE WITH RESPECT TO VERIFYING THE EXISTENCE OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS. WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE EXISTENCE OF CERTAIN HOME PRIVATE SCHOOLS. SO WHILE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT OUR INTENT TO INFRINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF PARENTS TO EDUCATE THERE'S CHILDREN AND I SETTING THAT THEY BELIEVE IS MOST PROPER FOR THEM. THE RIGHT AND HIGH DUTY THAT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER MENTIONED. WE DO SEE AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX AS A MODEST ATTEMPT. TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION THAN IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. WITH THIS IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE PERHAPS WORRY WITH THIS HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE TURBAN CASE I DON'T THINK ANY OF US CAN ANSWER THAT. BUT WE AS I PREVIOUSLY STATED WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SO TO ED IS OPPOSITION TWO MINUTES FOR EACH WITNESS. YOU DID NOT ASK FOR OTHER WITNESSES AND AND I I YOU KNOW I YOU'RE RIGHT I'M. I'M NOT WILL PRACTICE TODAY. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT USE A GOOD SKATER SIT DOWN. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IT'S GOOD TO THE OPPOSITION HOUSE ONE OF TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES. EACH THANK YOU. IS IS MICHAEL I'VE YES UP WHEN A MISSILE THEY SINGLETON I'M HOME SCHOOLING PARENTS SPEAKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOME SCHOOL NETWORK. FIRST WE OPPOSE AB TWO SEVEN FIVE SIX FOR PRIVACY REASONS. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED HARD TO KEEP. THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN PRIVATE. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DOES NOT NOW PUBLISHED DIRECTORY INFORMATION ON PRIVATE SCHOOLS WITH FIVE OR FEWER CHILDREN WHICH ARE PRESUMED TO BE HOME SCHOOLS. IF AB TWO SEVEN FIVE SIX PASSES AS WRITTEN SCHOOL SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED AS HOME SCHOOLS WILL BE POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF IT. EXCUSE ME EDUCATION WEBSITE. THE INFORMATION WILL INCLUDE THE FAMILIES. ADDRESS AND THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN EACH GRADE. THIS IS A. PRIVACY AND SAFETY ISSUE. SECOND. WE OPPOSE AB TWO SEVEN FIVE SIX. BECAUSE IT MANDATES ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION FROM HOMESCHOOLING FAMILIES. THAT ARE INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE FROM THE DATA. THIS DATA IS NOT NEEDED TO ADMINISTER ANY EXISTING LAW OR SOLVE AN EXISTING PROBLEM IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO BASE A POLICY. ON ALARM ISM AND HEADLINES. DECADES OF STUDIES SHOW THAT HOMESCHOOLERS ARE THRIVING PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS BEEN A LEADER IN ESTABLISHING ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF EDUCATION. HISTORY SHOWS THE DATA COLLECTION. NATIONWIDE HAS AND WILL BECOME A PRETEXT FOR HARASSMENT OF HOMESCHOOLING FAMILIES. AND A PRELUDE TO REGULATION THE SOLE FUNCTION OF WHICH IS TO ELIMINATE FLEXIBILITY FROM EDUCATION. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIS CHANCE TO SHARE OUR VIEWS AND I HOPE YOU'LL REACH OUT TO ITS IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THE HERE NEXT WITNESS. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NATHAN PIERCE PRIVATE HOME EDUCATORS OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE ALL HEARD OF THE ALLEGED ABUSE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND ARE APPALLED. SOME HAVE TAKEN THE POSITION THAT WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE REMEDIED BY FOR THE LEGISLATION OF HOME BASED PRIVATE EDUCATION CALIFORNIA. HELLO HOWEVER MY COLLEAGUES AND I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY IF THERE WAS NOT MORE TO THE STORY. I'M HERE WITH SOLVING SINGLETON OF. CALIFORNIA HOMESCHOOL NETWORK ALSO WITH DEBBIE SCHWARZER. HOME SCHOOL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND AMEND EVER OF CHRISTIAN HOME EDUCATORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND WITH DARREN JONES OF HOME SCHOOL LEGAL DEFENSE ASSOCIATION. WE ARE ALL HERE TODAY WITH ONE VOICE TO ASK YOU TO CONSIDER A FEW POINTS. AND TO NOT PASS AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX. INITIAL STATED INTENT OF THIS BILL WAS TO ADDRESS SAFETY CONCERNS FOR HOME SCHOOLED STUDENTS. PROM AND RECENT STUDY COMPARING THE FREQUENCY OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT TO PRIVATELY HOME SCHOOL CHILDREN IN LOW MEDIUM AND HIGH REGULATION STATES FOUND THAT THE FREQUENCY WAS THE SAME IN EACH CATEGORY. SHOWING CLEARLY THAT MORE REGULATION WILL NOT IMPACT THE FREQUENCY OF THE VIEWS OR NEGLECTING CALIFORNIA. THE TRAGIC CASE OF THE TURBINE FAMILY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY FROM WHICH SO MUCH INTEREST AND CONCERN PRIVATE HOME SCHOOLING HAS BEEN STIRRED UP DOESN'T REFLECT THE HOMESCHOOLING COMMUNITY. ACCORDING TO THE STATISTICS THIS TYPE OF ABUSE ISN'T PREVENTED BY INCREASED REGULATIONS AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BY THE TYPE OF DATA COLLECTED BY THIS BILL. THE CLAIM THAT THE ATA GATHERED WILL BE HELPFUL. TO. SCHOOL OFFICIALS WILL NOT ACTUALLY BE REALIZED IN A REAL SENSE AS TODAY. ARM CURRENTLY THE TRUANCY OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA DO HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA RELATING TO THE PRIVATE SCHOOL AFFIDAVITS FOR THOSE SCHOOLS. ALL SCHOOLS INCLUDING THOSE WITH FIVE OR FEWER STUDENTS. AB TWENTY FIVE. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX IS UNNECESSARY. I MAKE THIS BRIEF FILED BY THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL JERRY SURE HE COULD SUMMARIZE. SIR. SHOULD NOT SET POLICY OUT OF SENSATIONALISM I WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU.

WELL AMENDMENTS OF READY BEEN GIVEN. TO REDWOOD JUDICIAL. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. TO MAKE IT. EXPLICITLY CLEAR. A THAT THE AMENDMENTS WOULD INSURE.

YOU CAME FROM ALL AROUND THE STATE TO THE CAPITAL THE EIGHT REMIND US THAT WE ARE A GOVERNMENT OF. FOR AND BY THE PEOPLE. VERY IMPORTANT. I WANNA THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES I WANNA THANK. ALL OF THE THOUSANDS OF HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WHO HAVE MADE CALLS WHO HAVE WRITTEN LETTERS WHO ORGANIZED TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD AND TO FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS? IT'S BEEN TRULY INSPIRING TO SEE. AND WE HAVE SUCH WONDERFUL HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES JUST THIS LAST WEEKEND AYE JUDGED AYE. PUBLIC SPEAKING AND DEBATING TOURNAMENT FOR AYE FOR HOME SCHOOL STUDENTS AND MAN WITH THESE KIDS ARE IMPRESSIVE. I GOTTA SAY. I SO I AM. AND MR MEDINA I JUST HAD A FEW QUESTIONS ON THIS AND I. I APPRECIATE THE YOU'VE AMENDED YOUR BILL AND THANK GOODNESS. THAT OTHER BILL THAT WAS OUT THERE. IS GONE. AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT I I RESPECT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO. TO LISTEN TO ALL THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE OPPOSED HERE I'M SO I'M JUST CURIOUS SORT OF WHAT YOU'VE TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE CONVERSATIONS WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS AS TO WHY YOU THINK? OF ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO SHOWED UP TODAY FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I DID I STOOD HERE I LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE COMMENT. I I'M GRATEFUL. TO HEAR. I I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE. FOR GOVERNMENT. TO. LEGISLATE. AWAY PROBLEMS OF OUR SOCIETY. BUT. WHEN THE TURBINE CASE HAPPENED. IN AND IN THE IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT IN THE SIXTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. A IN THE CITY OF PARIS. I LIKE MANY OTHERS. IN MY DISTRICT LOOK FOR. LOOKED IN THE LAW. LOOKED FOR OUT WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE BEEN DONE. TO HAVE AVOIDED THAT INCIDENT. AND IT WAS THERE THAT WE SAW. THAT IT HAD BEEN. BY LAW PUT. ON FIRE MARSHALS. THAT THEY WERE TO INSPECT. PRIVATE SCHOOLS OF SIX OR MORE. INDIVIDUALS. AND AND AGAIN I I SAY AND AND AND AND I THANK AGAIN OF MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER GALLAGHER. IN IN IN HELPING ME REALIZE THAT AS MUCH AS WE MIGHT LIKE TO. IT IS NOT IN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY TO LEGISLATE. THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'D LIKE TO AVOID SOMETIMES. BUT THAT WAS WHAT LED ME TO FIRST THE FIRST BILL WHICH YOU MADE REFERENCE TO. AND SO AGAIN IN CONVERSATION AYE AYE AS I STAND HERE A IN FRONT. OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE THE PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE. I WOULD LOOK AGAIN. FOR PERHAPS ANOTHER WAY AND I WOULD IMPLORE. PEOPLE. NOT JUST HOME SCHOOL PARENTS BUT ALL PEOPLE. TO BE MORE VIGILANT. TO BE MORE ENGAGED IN WHAT GOES ON AROUND THEM. TO REPORT. WHAT THEY SEE? TO. NOT BE SO HESITANT TO JUST ALLOW. STRANGE OCCURRENCES TO HAPPEN WITHOUT. BUT NO TO FIND SOMEONE. AND AND I THINK IF THAT IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IN MY CITY OF PARIS THAT I REPRESENT PERHAPS. OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE TURBAN FAMILY COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. SO AYE AYE I WILL IN MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT TO. A CONTINUE IN THAT EFFORT I WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. HOWEVER. IN THIS BILL. IN THIS BILL TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX I WOULD REMIND THIS COMMITTEE WHAT IT DOES AND WHAT IT DOESN'T DO. AND AND IF I MIGHT. IN CLOSING UNLESS YOU HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS. WELL WELL OF STUFF THERE THAT. I THINK THAT EVERYONE HERE ON IT KNOWLEDGE IS HOW TERRIBLE THE INCIDENT THAT THAT YOU REFER TO IS. BUT. I THINK EVERYONE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THAT'S AN EXTREME OUT WIRE CASE. AND ANY DATA SET WILL HAVE EXTREME OUT WIRE CASES. AND ITS NOT GENERALLY RESPONSIBLE POLICY MAKING IN MY VIEW. TO CREATE POLICY. ON THE BASIS OF THE EXTREME OUT LYER CASE AS OPPOSE TO. A LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE POPULATION SO I I MEAN WHAT PROBLEM IS IT THAT YOU SEE. IN THE HOME SCHOOL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. THAT THIS BILL WOULD SOLVE. AYE I DO NOT SEE A PROBLEM. IN THE HOMESCHOOL COMMUNITY AT ALL AS I SAID IT MY BEGINNING. I RESPECT. PARENTS AS EDUCATORS. BEING AN EDUCATOR MYSELF I I DO NOT SEE A PROBLEM I I WAS TRYING TO. REMEMBER. GENTLEMAN WHO I. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR AS VALID AS A COMMENCEMENT. ADDRESS AT LAST YEAR UNIVERSITY OF A YOUNG MAN. OF HIS NAME IS JEREMIAH PURDY. JEREMIAH PURDY WAS HOME SCHOOLED. HE THEN WENT ON. TO PRESTIGIOUS PRIVATE SCHOOL AFTER THAT AND. GRADUATED. LAW SCHOOL I BELIEVE A DUKW. AND JEREMIAH PURDY CAME AND GAVE THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT LAST YEAR UNIVERSITY. I THINK I'VE READ TWO OF HIS BOOKS NOW. UP SO I DO NOT SEE A PROBLEM. WITH HOME SCHOOLING. AND. IT THIS BILL IS NOT AN ATTEMPT. TO. ANYWAY ATTACK HOME SCHOOLING. AT ALL. A IT IS NOT AN INTENT. SOLVE A PROBLEM WITH HOME SCHOOLING. SO I GUESS WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE BILL THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE. COLLECTING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT. THE. THE NATURE. OF OF EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL ON. AND WHAT USE IS GOING TO BE MADE ABOUT INFORMATION. IN MY EFFORT TO. TO LOOK AT WHAT WE DO AND WHAT WE DON'T DO. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I. WAS LOOKED SOMEWHAT. BUT. SOMEWHAT SURPRISED BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NO RECORD AT ALL ACTUALLY. OF NUMBERS OF OUR PARENTS WHO HOME SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN I I BELIEVE THAT EVEN IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS. IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THE NUMBER THAT IS PRESENTED THERE IS IS A NUMBER THAT IN MY UNDERSTANDING. IS ONLY. A SORT OF EXASPERATED IS ONLY JUST TAKEN OUT OF THE DATA. BECAUSE THERE AND I HAVE RIGHT HERE. THE AFFIDAVIT FORM. PARENTS FILL OUT AND NO WHERE ON THIS FORUM IS THERE ANYWHERE TO PUT. THAT THEY ARE HOME SCHOOL. IT ONLY SHOWS THAT THERE ARE. IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL. SO WE DO NOT HAVE. ANY. RELIABLE NUMBER. AT ALL. OF HOW MANY. PARENTS OR HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HOME SCHOOL. SO THAT IS WHY I SAID YEAH IN YOUR IN ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. TO BE COGNIZANT OF WHAT THIS BILL. TRIES TO DO AND DOESN'T DO. AND ALL IT IS. TRYING TO DO ALL THAT IT ASKS FOR. IT JUST AGGREGATE. HOME SCHOOLING FROM OTHER PRIVATE SCHOOLS. AND GIVES. FIVE DIFFERENT A OPTIONS THE PARENTS. COULD I READ THOSE OPTIONS. THOSE OPTIONS. OUR CONVENTIONAL FOR TRADITIONAL PRIVATE SCHOOL. PRIVATE SCHOOLS SATELLITE PROGRAM. PRIVATE ONLINE OR VILLAGES OR VIRTUAL SCHOOL. PARENT GUARDIAN OR OTHER INDIVIDUAL OPERATING A PRIVATE HOME SCHOOL. CERTIFIED NON PUBLIC NON SECTARIAN SCHOOL SO WOULD BROADEN. GIVE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION SCHOOL THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING. MY QUESTION THOUGH IS. YOU KNOW USUALLY WHEN WE'RE COLLECTING. DATA OR INFORMATION WE DO SO FOR A REASON SO WHAT IS THE. REASON THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THIS DISAGGREGATED DATA WHAT ARE WE PLANNING TO DO WITH I I I THINK IT WOULD GIVE A BETTER PICTURE. OF OF THE EDUCATIONAL A LANDSCAPE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I I'D.

AYE I YOU KNOW I I VERY MUCH DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE NARROWED YOUR BILL BUT I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S CONCERNING FOLKS HERE IS THAT I THINK WE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF THE INTENSE WHEN WE HAVE A MUCH BROADER LEGISLATION. AND I THINK THAT ALL THE FOLKS WHO. TOOK TIME OUT OF THEIR DAY AND TRAVELED A LONG WAYS TO BE HERE. FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING TARGETED UNFAIRLY AND. AND I THINK THE RIGHT AND THAT YOU KNOW AS I SAID I I REALLY RESPECT YOUR THINKING A LOT OF GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS BUT I'M DEEPLY TROUBLED. BY THE DIRECTION OF THIS LEGISLATION AND I THINK COULD BE. YOU KNOW A GREAT ACT FOR YOU THAT TO BE CONSIDERATE AND ABANDON THE THIS POINT SO I I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO. AND IF NOT ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE THE BILL DOWN THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. A THE SEEING NINE. YOU WE WON'T TAKE MOTION RIGHT NOW BUT YOU MAKE CLOTHES. I I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AND. AS A THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS THE BILL.

AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT. I MISTER AT ALL. THIS ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT BY MISTER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS IDENTIFIED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. A VERY CAPABLE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND CHIEF OF STAFF I GUESS TO. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHT ESTABLISHES A PILOT PROJECT FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT USE TASK ORDER CONTRACTING. AGAIN THAT'S TASK ORDER CONTRACTING SIMILAR TO JOB ORDER CONTRACTING WHICH ALLOWS COME WHICH IS THE COMMITTEE HAS PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED. LA A A LA U. S. D. WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO OUT TO BID ON CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES AND REPAIRS. BEFORE THEY ARE NEEDED. FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE HOT SEASON HVAC SYSTEMS WILL BREAK DOWN. GOING OUT OF IT AFTER A QUICK MINT NAM FUNCTIONS TAKES TIME AND WILL LIKELY BE COSTLY. SIMPLE SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONCEPT APPLIES HERE. DELAY REPAIRS MAY AFFECT INSTRUCTION AND STUDENTS ABILITY TO LEARN THAT'S A NO BRAINER. I BEND A HUNDRED TEN DEGREE CLASSROOM. YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT A. HEALTHY SITUATION FOR LEARNING OR. PEOPLE OUGHT DELAY IN REPAIRS MAY AFFECT CONSTRUCTION AND STUDENTS ABILITY TO LEARN OF COURSE AS I STATED A BY HAVING CONTRACTS IN PLACE EARLIER. THIS BILL WILL ENABLE ELITIST YOU TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS REPAIRS WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED AND WILL SAY THE DISTRICT MONEY BECAUSE THE PRICES ARE PRE. DETERMINED. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT IS MARK HOPING TO HOOK. WHO BETTER THE CHIEF FACILITIES EXECUTIVE WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WITH THAT I TURNED OVER AND I HOPE I SAID YOUR NAME CORRECTLY AND I DON'T PLEASE CORRECT? AND I DON'T KNOW. WELL MARC COOPER WHO WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT IN HOUSE WORK FORCE THAT DOES OUR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR WORK. BUT THERE ARE SOME SITUATIONS WHEN WE NEED MORE. THAN THAT TO MAINTAIN OUR THOUSAND CAMPUSES. OUR. THIRTEEN THOUSAND BUILDINGS THIRTY THOUSAND CLASSROOMS. SOMETIMES. THE WORKLOAD JUST EXCEEDS OUR CAPACITY TO WORK WITH OUR IN HOUSE STAFF IT'S NOT PRACTICAL TO HAVE WORKERS ON STAFF ANTICIPATED THE SEASONAL LOADING THAT WE MIGHT HAVE. I'M SOMETIMES WE NEED SPECIAL UP SPECIALIZED SKILLSETS BUT WE DON'T NEED HIM ON A RECURRING BASIS OF DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THAT STAFF ON BOARD SO WE HAVE TO. LOOK SEEK OTHER MEANS IT'S NOT PRACTICAL FOR US TO OWN SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT LIKE CRANES AND PEOPLE LAUGHS MORE SPECIALIZED BORING EQUIPMENT. SO WHEN WE NEED. TO HAVE THIS EXTRA HELP FOR OUR WORKFORCE WE HAVE TO LOOK TO THE INDUSTRY TO CONTRACT OUT. NOW THERE ARE. I'M PROVISIONS NOW THAT ALLOW US TO CONTRACTED OUT BUT IT'S NOT AS EFFICIENT AS WE COULD HAVE. COME THERE TIMES WHEN. IF WE CONTRACT OUT IT MIGHT TAKE US LONGER TO GO GET THAT WORK DONE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A BIDDING PROCESS THAT COULD BE ME CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED. USUALLY WHEN WE HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT WE NEED HELP IT'S URGENT. AND WE NEED TO HAVE IT RIGHT AWAY IT COSTS US MORE BECAUSE IT'S SEASONAL IT WHEN AIR CONDITIONING GOES OUT USUALLY LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLES ARE COMMISSION GOT MORE NOW COMPETING FOR THE CONTRACT TO HAVE HIS WORK DONE. AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS GIVE US THE HIGHEST QUALITIES I'M SOMETIMES WE SPECIFY WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR MATERIAL. BUT CONTRACTORS CAN COME IN AND REQUEST A SUBSTITUTION OF THAT MATERIAL WEALTH IT'S URGENT FOR US WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH THAT EVALUATION PROCESS AND WE HAVE TO JUST ACCEPT. SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST. I'M THIS BILL WE WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE. WE ACTUALLY LIKE THE PROCESS WHERE WE AWARD THE LOWEST RESPONSIVE RESPONSIBLE BETTER. WE JUST BELIEVE IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD DO ALL OF THAT PRELIMINARY WORK TO ESTABLISH. WHO THAT CONTRACTORS GONNA BE PRIOR TO US NEEDING THE URGENT WORK? WE GOT ENOUGH HISTORICAL DATA NOW TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A COUPLE DOZEN COMPRESSORS THAT ARE GONNA GO OUT. WE KNOW TREES ARE GONNA FALL DOWN WE KNOW PLUMBING IS GONNA BREAK WHICH DON'T KNOW WHICH OF OUR ONE THOUSAND CAMPUSES IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON WE DON'T KNOW NGUYEN. BUT WITH THIS LEGISLATION WE CAN HAVE ALL THAT WORK DONE IN ADVANCE WERE PREPARED TO IT IMMEDIATELY AND URGENTLY DO THAT. AND WE WOULD WE BELIEVE OTHER PEOPLE COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS AS WELL AND WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THIS LEGISLATION THAT WE CAN DO IT. FASTER WE CAN DO IT MORE COSTLY EFFECTIVELY AND WE CAN DO WITH BETTER QUALITY. THANK YOU. I WOULDN'T TAKE A MOMENT TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND I'M SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. O'DONNELL. HERE.

WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. AND I WOULD SAY BEFORE ACTUALLY OUT WE GET TO THE VOWED THAT I I THINK THIS IS. A GOOD IDEA UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT BE TO SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT I THINK THAT IT'S TIME WHEN A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING. FINANCIALLY IT'S NOT GOOD TO IMPOSE EXTRA COST IT'LL JUST BENEFIT ONE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP BUT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. SECOND. WE HAVE A SECOND OUT OF SEVENTY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE A. B.. TWO THOUSAND TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWO THOUSAND AND TWO DIRECTS THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION AND THE STATE BOARD TO DEVELOP MODEL CURRICULUM FOR MY LONG HISTORY AND CULTURAL STUDIES. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENCOURAGED INSTRUCTION IN SOCIAL SCIENCES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION ON THE VIETNAM WAR. INCLUDING THE SECRET WAR IN LAOS AND THE ROLE OF THE SOUTHEAST ASIANS IN THIS WAR. AS A RESULT TEXTBOOK PUBLISHERS. HAVE NOT INCLUDED AMONG CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SECRET WAR IN LAOS. LEAVING STUDENTS LARGELY UNAWARE. OF THIS PART OF OUR AMERICAN HISTORY. I BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT AND TO DEVELOP A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATION OF THE SACRIFICES AND SERVICE OF THEM LONG AND LOUD VETERANS. AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITED STATES MOVE THE BILL ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY TEN CENSUS CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST MON POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. WITH OVER APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. FRESNO IS HOME TO APPROXIMATELY THIRTY TWO THOUSAND MOAN AND HAS THE SECOND LARGEST LONG POPULATION IN OUR COUNTRY AFTER MINNEAPOLIS. CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY HAS OVER FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND MON. THE MONEY PEOPLE HAVE A STORY OF COURAGE AND SUFFERING THAT SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR CURRICULUM AND TAUGHT TO STUDENTS. MOST STUDENTS KNOW NOTHING ABOUT MY OWN HISTORY OR CULTURE AND I BELIEVE MODEL CURRICULUM WILL HELP STUDENTS APPRECIATE LONG HISTORY AND CULTURE. ESPECIALLY IN REGIONS WITH LARGE MUNG POPULATIONS. THE MONK PEOPLE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT SACRIFICES AND ARE A RICH PART OF OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR STATE. AB TWO THOUSAND TWO WILL PROVIDE EDUCATORS WITH THE TOOLS TO HELP EDUCATE CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MONEY PEOPLE SO THEIR SACRIFICES ARE NOT FORGOTTEN.

THAT'S IT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY THAT ADDS A PROVISION NOT LIMITING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS IN THE WORKING GROUP AS WELL AS ADDING THE WORKING GROUP. SHALL CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THE SERVICE OF THE SERVICES CREDENTIAL IS WARRANTED. I THOUGHT SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVEN THESE BOTH OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS AND PHYSICAL THERAPISTS HAVE. PROVIDED THERAPY SERVICES TO STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SETTINGS THE FEDERAL AND IT. THE FEDERAL INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES I EDUCATION ACT. ASSURES THAT CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS WILL RECEIVE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TAILORED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS FEDERAL ACT. O. T. AND PT SERVICES WERE TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY TAKING CHOI AYE CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL. TO GO TO AN O. T. OR P. T. APPOINTMENT. UNDER THE ACT THE BECAME MORE SENSIBLE TO HAVE. TEASE IMPEACHES PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO STUDENTS ON SCHOOL SITES WORKING AS SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES NAY JOINED OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST. SCHOOL NURSES SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS AND OTHERS HOWEVER THESE OTHER PROVIDERS. PROVIDER PROFESSIONS WERE IN THE SCHOOLS PRIOR TO THE INCLUSION OF THE SCHOOL BASED O. T. MPT SERVICES AND BY THAT TIME THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING HAD ALREADY ESTABLISHED CREDENTIALS FOR THOSE OTHER HEALTHCARE. PROFESSIONS A CREDENTIAL POSITION IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT WHICH COMES TO MANAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT ADVANCEMENTS. THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE TYPICALLY TYPICALLY ONLY OPEN TO THESE WHIPPED UP TO THOSE WITH CREDENTIALS. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX ASKED THE CDC TO STUDY THE ISSUE FOR EACH PROFESSION THROUGH THE FORMATION OF A WORKING GROUP. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS LISTED UNDER THE BILL HERE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TO RE ADVOCATES THAT HAD BEEN APPROVED BY THE CHAIR.

RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THAT AN AYE VOTE FOR TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS DON JAMES AND I'M A PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX. AS A FORMER SCHOOL PHYSICAL THERAPIST I CAN SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS SCHOOL PHYSICAL THERAPIST LEAVE THE POSITION AS LACK OF A CAREER LADDER. IN FACT THAT'S THE REASON THAT I LEFT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AFTER SIXTEEN YEARS DESPITE THE GREAT BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT PACKAGE. I WAS ASKED BY ADMINISTRATORS TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO APPLY FOR SPECIALS POSITIONS AND SERVE ON COMMITTEES HOWEVER. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF A CREDENTIAL I COULDN'T EVEN APPLY FOR THAT POSITION. BUT DESPITE THE. SKILLS AND BACKGROUND THAT I COULD. BENEFIT STUDENTS I'M AYE LACK THAT CREDENTIALING COULDN'T APPLY AND THE SECOND REASON IS THERE PERSONALLY THE POSITION AS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF OUR UNIQUE ROLES IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. OTIS AMPUTEES ARE THE ONLY LICENSED NON CREDENTIALED RELATED SERVICE PROVIDERS CURRENTLY WORKING IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. THE ENTRY LEVEL THE GRIEF OF PHYSICAL THERAPISTS IS A DOCTORATE DEGREE. HOWEVER IN SOME CASES ARE REPRESENTED BY THE CLASSIFIED UNION THIS IMPORTANT UNION REPRESENTS THE VITAL NEEDS OF SCHOOL EMPLOYEES INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION SECURITY AND FOOD SERVICES. HOWEVER OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT MEANS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES. ADDITIONALLY OUR ADMINISTRATORS ARE OFTEN FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHERS OUR PRINCIPALS WHO MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF OUR DOCUMENTATION. REQUIREMENTS CONTINUING EDUCATION NEEDS ARE PRACTICE ACTS WITHOUT THE WITHOUT THE ABILITY FOR VOICES TO BE HEARD AT AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL WITHOUT ADMINISTRATORS WHO TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE DO. SCHOOL OG'S AMPUTEES LACK THE PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT NEEDED TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX WORLD OF SPECIAL EDUCATION EDUCATION. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX WILL PROVIDE EQUITY FOR SCHOOL BASED PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND ASSIST DISTRICTS IN THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF AUTISM PT'S BY BRINGING OUR UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES TO THE EDUCATION TEAM. AN IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE FOR AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU.

AND A MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL PURSUING MY DOCTORATE AS WELL AS COMPLETING CHO AT THE CLASSES FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE CREDENTIAL. I ARRIVED AND THOUGHT THIS IS GREAT I CAN SIT AT THE TABLE AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN AN EQUITABLE FASHION.

I AM LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA QUALIFIED TO WORK IN SCHOOLS I SERVE ON TEAMS THAT DEVELOPED BY A PIECE AND COLLABORATE WITH CLASSROOM TEACHERS AS WELL AS WORK DIRECTLY WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH THE VARIETY. OF SPECIAL NEEDS INCLUDING AUTISM NEUROLOGICAL IMPAIRMENTS AND CHILDREN WHO SUFFER EMOTIONALLY. I SUPPORT THE STUDENTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS INCLUDING ADDRESSING MOTOR SKILLS ARE ADAPTING THEIR ENVIRONMENT WAS SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS HELPING THEM TO TOLERATE THE CENTURY ENVIRONMENTS OF THE BUSY CLASSROOM. THE MANDATORY CREDENTIAL WILL MAKE ME UNQUALIFIED TO DO A JOB I HAD DONE FOR DECADES IT WILL ALSO FORCE ME TO TAKE ADDITIONAL CLASSES INCUR MORE COSTS TO KEEP MY JOB. THIS PLUS THE FACT THAT I AM ALREADY OBLIGATED TO MAINTAIN TWENTY FOUR UNITS CONTINUING EDUCATIONS FOR MY LICENSE WILL MAKE EXPENSIVE FOR ME TO REMAIN IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. I MAY BE FORCED TO LEAVE A JOB I TRULY LOVE. THE VACANCY I CREATE WILL FORCE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONTRACT WITH EXPENSIVE VENDORS THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A CREDENTIAL. FOR ALL THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE UNLESS THE BILL AS AMENDED TO ALLOW AN OPTION. FOR SCHOOL BASED O. TEAS AND PT'S TO WORK IN THE SCHOOLS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS BETSY GRAY AND I'M AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST ATTACK IN CSE A MEMBER. AND I WORK FOR SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I WORKED IN SCHOOL B. THIRTY FOR SIX YEARS AND I LOVE MY JOB AND THE STUDENTS I WORK WITH. I AM HERE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX BECAUSE THIS WORKGROUP COULD DEVELOP ARE ACQUIRED CREDENTIALS. FOR SCHOOL BASED IN POTEET AND PT'S THIS BILL IS ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT MY CAREER AND IT'S ABOUT MY PAY AND MY BENEFITS. MOVING TOWARD A MANDATORY CREDENTIAL WOULD PUT US INTO THE CERTIFICATED SALARY UNION AND ON THAT SALARY SCHEDULE. ON THE CURRENT CERTIFICATED PAYSCALE WHICH ENCOMPASSES TEACHERS SPEECH THERAPISTS NURSES ETCETERA I HAVING A MASTER'S DEGREE WOULD BE BUMPED BACK TO THIS STEPPED HILL AND I WOULD MAKE FIFTY FOUR PERCENT LAST. THAN I CURRENTLY DO NOW. MY TEAM MEMBERS WHO A BACHELOR'S DEGREES WILL BE PUMPED FURTHER BACK MAKING FIFTY FIVE PERCENT LESS THAN THEIR CURRENT SALARY. ALL OF THEM HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE THAN I. I PERSONALLY DON'T WANT AS SERVICE CREDENTIAL. I DON'T WANT TO BE AN ADMINISTRATOR AND HAVE TO SUPERVISE OTHER DISCIPLINES DEAL WITH ANGRY PARENTS DEVELOP CURRICULUM AND WORK ON PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. I WANT TO WORK WITH STUDENTS AS I HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO DEAL. WE HAD. TEASE HAVE OUR SPECIALTY AND I BELIEVE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS HAVE THEIRS WE CAN LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER BUT WE ARE EDUCATED IN DIFFERENT AND SPECIFIC TOPICS. WELL I SUPPORT ALLOWING. TEASING PT'S WHO WANT A SERVICE CREDENTIAL TO GET ONE AYE OPPOSER OF ACQUIRING ALL OF US TO GET A SERVICE CREDENTIAL TO WORK IN THE SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY WHEN PRIVATE CONTRACTED AGENCIES ARE EXAMS. I BELIEVE THIS CREDENTIAL WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFESSION AND WE WILL LOSE OUT ON OH TEAS AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN FAVOR OF THESE CONTRACTORS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHY THIS GROUP WANTED. THE CREDENTIALING IN THE FIRST PLACE I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YA WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WERE ALSO PULLS LISTA MINUTES WITH GOOD OPTION. HI JEANETTE THEM OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST OPPOSED. CARRIE BAUMGARTNER LICENSE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS WITH THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I OPPOSE. HI MICHELLE PEELER OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL.

BUT II I I ENCOURAGE YOU TO FIND A PLACE THAT WHERE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS CAN BE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE TODAY. I IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME SELL THOSE CONVERSATIONS I'M SURE WILL CONTINUE WITH THAT ANY OTHER COMMENTS MANY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEEING THEM DO WE HAVE A MOTION. YEAH. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. OKAY. I'M IN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS MAKE CLONES LIKE YEAH. YEAH YOU YOU YOU DIDN'T THERE WERE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE NOT TAKEN IS THAT CORRECT. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL WAS TO ESTABLISH A WORKING GROUP'S ALL OF THE THE OPPOSITION FROM WHAT I I HEARD IS. ABOUT. ACTUALLY AFTER THE WORKING GROUP HAS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT WE INCLUDED. WE DON'T LIMIT THE NUMBER OF OF. MEMBERS I CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE WORKING GROUP SO THIS IS NOT ESTABLISHING A CREDENTIAL RIGHT NOW IT'S ESTABLISHING A WORK GROUP SO THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE CREDENTIAL. AND TO YOUR POINT ABOUT NOT BEING THERE THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE OF THE WORKING GROUP SO THAT WE CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT AS TO HOW THIS WOULD WORK. AND SO. SO SO. THE. THE END BUT I THINK THE REYES ISSUE ABOUT REPRESENTATION ON THE COMMITTEE. AND SO THERE HASN'T BEEN AN AN IDENTIFIABLE. NUMBER BUT THERE IS A DISCUSSION THAT THERE WILL BE AMENDMENTS TO THE WORKING GROUP I'M NOT MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL BE ON THE COMMITTEE YES SO SO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK. IT DIDN'T LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE THAT COULD BECOME WE CAN DECIDE WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THAT AND ARE WORKING. COUNTY WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE INCLUDED IN A WORKING OUTSIDE AS IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS THEIR PROFESSION ABSOLUTELY AND I'M. OBVIOUSLY I WAS A FORMER TEACHER SO I'M IF SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING TO MY JOB I WOULD BE. WANTING TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT SO I I HAVE NEVER BEEN OPPOSED TO THAT I THINK THAT'S THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF NOT LIMITING THE NUMBER OF OF MEMBERS IN THE WORKING GROUP. AND ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ASSIMILATE AMENDMENTS WHERE IT SITS BEHIND. THE AD IN THE TIMELINE SO THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF BILLS TODAY. NEXT AND YOU'RE NOT DONE YET. I DO AS WELL GOING TO CLOSE THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO FOR OPERATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

I WAS EVER GOING TO MOVE A FILE ITEM NUMBER THIRTY THREE WHICH IS AB THREE ZERO NINE SIX THIS IS YOUR LAST EVERY THREE BILLS. THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO DOCTOR WEBER THEN I'M MR CHU PATIENTLY AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OFFERS I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT CHAIR IN HIS COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO IMPROVE THE COMPONENTS OF THE BILL. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AYE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS INTERESTED IN THIS LEGISLATION TODAY I AM PRESENTING A. B. THIRTY NINETY SIX. A BILL THAT STREAMLINES ACCESS TO THE SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT CARD FOR STARK. BY MAKING THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ONLINE AND AVAILABLE TO BE PRINTED IF DESIRED. CURRENTLY SCHOOL AND DISTRICT LEVEL STAFF ANNUAL TO COMPLETE THE STARK THE FINGER PLAN FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT S. P. S. A LOCAL EDUCATION. AGENCY LDA PLAN TO THE AND THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN THE EL CAP. FEDERAL TITLE ONE REPORTS CIVIL RIGHTS DATA COLLECTION AMONG THOUSANDS OF OTHER REPORTS REQUIRED FOR STATE AND FEDERAL PURPOSES. A. B. THIRTY NINETY SIX CREATES A MORE ALIGNED REPORTING SYSTEM FOR THE START AS WELL AS THE ONE STOP RESOURCE FOR PARENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR SCHOOLS. THE BILL WILL STREAMLINED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. TO DEVELOPING ANNUALLY COMPLETE A STARK FOR EACH SCHOOL AND MAKE THE STARK AVAILABLE ONLINE% INSTEAD OF REQUIRING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ANNUALLY COMPLETE THE STARK AS A SEPARATE REPORT. HERE WITH ME TODAY ARE THE SPONSORS REPRESENTATIVES FOR MY BILL ELIZABETH SHEPARD COORDINATOR OF COMPLIANCE FOR THE FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED. SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE. AND THE HERE REPRESENTING THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND SOOTHING AND BECAUSE ON THESE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL. QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF AYE MELISSA SHEPHARD AND SERVICE THE COURT DATE OF COMPLAINTS IN A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY NINETY SIX. IN NINETEEN NINETY WHEN I STARTED MY CREDENTIAL PROGRAM FORTY TO BECOME A TEACHER I NEVER IMAGINED THAT WE WOULD BE SITTING HERE TODAY TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY TO PROVIDE STUDENT INFORMATION TO PARENTS. AND COMMUNITIES WE SERVE BASED ON THE PROFOUND WORK THE VARIOUS COMMITTEE MEMBERS LIKE YOURSELF HAVE DONE IN THE PAST OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. TODAY I AM HERE TO EXPRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS TO BE TO BE BETTER COLLECT TO BETTER COLLABORATE. IN COOPERATION FOR STUDENT AND SCHOOL DATA TWO MORE MEANINGFULLY PASSED TO PARENTS TEACHERS AND OTHER. COMMITTEE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. CALIFORNIA HAS PREVIOUSLY ENGAGED IN A SIMILAR EFFORT WHEN OUR STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WAS ABLE TO. TO WORK WITH. I EP INDIVIDUALS WITH EDUCATION PROGRAMS. TO. TO UPLOAD INFORMATION FROM OUR STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AS A RESULT THIS ALLOWED SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO SPEND MORE TIME WORKING WITH STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. AND INSTEAD OF DUPLICATING DATA TO PAPERWORK. THIS BILL IF PASSED WOULD DO THE SAME THING FOR DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS SITE ADMINISTRATORS SUCH AS OUR PRINCIPLES. IT WOULD ALLOW US MORE TIME TO BETTER SUPPORT TEACHERS AND STAFF MEMBERS IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF OUR INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES. AND DIRECT START SERVICES TO STUDENTS. THIS BILL IS ALSO GREAT FOR STUDENTS BECAUSE IN. BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS AMERICA CALIFORNIA IS TO INCREASE PARENT ENGAGEMENT. AN ACTIVE. AND INCREASE ACTIVE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR PARENTS AND TRANSPARENCY INCONSISTENCY OF INFORMATION IS THE FIRST MOVEMENT TO BUILD TRUST AND TRUST BUILDS. MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION FROM PARENTS. THIS ENHANCEMENT OF AN ONLINE STARK WILL FACILITATE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AS THERE WOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION EXCEPT ACCESSIBLE IN ONE PLACE. PLEASE AUTONOMOUS. COMPLEMENTED BY THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD FOR QUICK ONLINE ACCESS TO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BOTH SCHOOL DISTRICT REPORTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SUE BANG ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TRUCKS AND CO SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. THE SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT CARD WITH ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AS PART OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. THE LAST DECADE AND ESPECIALLY SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IN THE SCHOOL DASHBOARD. STARK HAS BECOME A RELIC OF THE PAST PERSONAL LONGER REFERRING TO START TO SEE OTHER SCHOOLS ARE DOING. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND HAS UPDATED THE SITE TEMPLATE WHICH I'VE HANDED OUT TO YOU ABOUT SEVENTEEN PAGES LONG. TOLD CLIMATE TO LCF HAVE HOWEVER DUE TO OUTDATED REQUIREMENTS TO START REMAINS. ARM A PAPER COPY OR CAN BE UPLOADED ONLINE AS A PDF COMPOSING OF SEVENTEEN PAGES OR MORE. AND IS NOT USER FRIENDLY AS IT WAS INTENDED A FOR ITS AUDIENCE PARTICULARLY PARENTS. AB THIRTY NINETY SIX WITH STREAMLINED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE START BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO ANNUALLY COMPLETISTS ARC FOR EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL. AND MAKE THE STARK'S AVAILABLE ONLINE I'VE ALSO HANDED OUT. A MOCKUP OF THE STARK ONLINE BUT WHAT THE* WOULD LOOK ONLINE. AND PARENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT ONE DATA ELEMENT AT A TIME OR EXPAND ALSO ACTED ON WOMEN'S. WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM TO SEE THE ENTIRE SOCK REPORT IN ONE LUCK. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ALSO MAKE STARK AVAILABLE AS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS APPLICATION AND WHICH HAS FIVE THOUSAND CURRENT USERS SO PARENTS CAN ACCESS OUR. FROM THEIR SMARTPHONES AND THEIR TABLETS. UNDER A A. B. THIRTY NINETY SIX THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD CONTINUE TO ANNUALLY PUBLICIZED AVAILABILITY OF SPARKS AND PROVIDE HARD COPIES TO PARENTS. AB THIRTY NINETY SIX LEVERAGES EXISTING DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS TO UPDATE IN STREAMLINED THE START AND BRING IT INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AS MENTIONED CITY BECAUSE ON IS. THE DIRECTOR OF OUR ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY REPORTING DIVISION IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL PROGRAM QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. BUT. MY DAD DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HAVE ACCESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR TO STRONG SUPPORT. INDICATE A WATCH ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES UNIFIED IN SUPPORT. LIKE ANY OTHER SPORTS SEEN ON ANY OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M WHISKEY AND WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES WE TOOK IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. THE CIRCUS REQUIRED IN OUR CONSTITUTION AS YOU HEARD BY PROP NINETY EIGHT AND ONLY LEGISLATION THAT FURTHERS THE PURPOSE. A PROP NINETY EIGHT MAYBE ENACTED DELETING CRITICAL WILLIAMS SCHOOL LEVEL INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE NO WHERE ELSE WOULD DETRACT FROM NOT FURTHER THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PURPOSES. OF NINETY EIGHT THAT WOULD MAKE THE SPELL UNCONSTITUTIONAL OUR OPPOSITION STEMS FROM OUR REPRESENTATION OF A MILLION PLUS CHILDREN THAT WERE IN SCHOOLS ONLY IN THE LAST DECADE WITHOUT THE BARE NECESSITIES FOR AN EDUCATION. THAT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED EQUAL FULLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS PROPERLY ASSIGNED IMPERMANENT SUFFICIENT INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS CURRENT AND ALIGNED TO STANDARDS AND FACILITIES THAT ARE SAFE FUNCTIONAL AND NOT A THREAT TO HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE STATE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD NO SYSTEM TO INSPECT DETECT AND MONITOR ON A SYSTEMIC LEVEL WHETHER IT PROVIDES THESE VERY BASIC NECESSITIES AND ALL ITS SCHOOLS. THE CHOSEN MECHANISM FOR COLLECTING AND REPORTING THIS DATA IN THE WILLIAM SETTLEMENT LEGISLATION WAS THE SLORC WHILE WE SUPPORT THIS. DIRECTION OF ELIMINATING REDUNDANT ACTIVITIES REMOVING WILLIAMS THE SCHOOL LEVEL INFORMATION IS NOT ONE OF THEM. NOW MORE THAN EVER THE STATE IS RELYING ON THIS INFORMATION FOR ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER LC FF THE DASHBOARD REPORTS ON THE WILLIAMS CONDITIONS. AND THE GUIDANCE THAT DEPARTMENT PUTS OUT DIRECTS DISTRICTS TO USE THE STARK FOR GATHERING AND REPORTING THIS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. WITHOUT THIS CRITICAL DATA WHICH AFFECTS EVERY SCHOOL AND EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL FAMILY WE EXPOSE OURSELVES AGAIN TO A PRE WILLIAMS ERA. WITH ALL DISTRICTS CHECKING THE BOXES IN THE DASHBOARD THAT THEY HAVE MET THE STANDARDS FOR DECENT SCHOOLS BUT WITH NO ACTUAL SCHOOL LEVEL INFORMATION AT ALL. AND WIDESPREAD INEQUALITIES OBVIOUSLY WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS BUT THESE ARE THE REASONS FOR OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA A LEAD TOGETHER WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES FOR ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT BROUGHT THE WILLIAMS LITIGATION. TO ADDRESS. SEVERE INEQUITIES AND AND. LACKING FACILITIES AND TEXTBOOKS OF FOR MANY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CHILDREN. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THAT THE INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER THE WILLIAM SETTLEMENT IS NOT SOME KIND OF ADD ON TO WHAT'S IN THE STARK. IT'S INFORMATION THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO ASSESSING HOW WELL SCHOOL IS DOING ITS JOB. TO GIVE SOME EXAMPLES IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS BEFORE THE WILLIAM SETTLEMENT THERE WERE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION SCHOOL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THE BOOKS THEY NEEDED FOR HOMEWORK. ONE POINT NINE MILLION WERE IN CLASSROOMS THAT WERE TOO HOT OR COLD. I ONE POINT SIX MILLION WERE IN SCHOOLS INFESTED WITH ROACHES RATS OR MICE AND ONE MILLION WERE IN SCHOOLS WITH NON WORKING BATHROOMS ARE CLOSE BATHROOMS. KIDS CANNOT LEARN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THEY ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR EDUCATION AS OUR. TEACHERS OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU MIGHT THINK OF AS ESSENTIAL TO EDUCATION. WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS SINCE THEN BECAUSE OF WILLIAM'S AND BECAUSE OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS NOW AVAILABLE. THROUGH. THROUGH THE WILLIAM SETTLEMENT. AND IN THE STARK IT ALLOWS FAMILIES AND ADVOCATES TO MONITOR HOW DISTRICTS ARE DOING IN MAKING SURE THAT FACILITIES ARE MAINTAINED AND AND BOOKS AND MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE. WE ARE OPEN TO DISCUSSION AND HAVE BEGUN DISCUSSIONS. WITH THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHORS OFFICE AS TO HOW THE INFORMATION GETS PUT INTO THE SAR. BUT IT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE IN THE SAR SO THAT PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR LOCAL SCHOOLS IT CANNOT SIMPLY BE ELIMINATED. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS AND SPONSORS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. OTHER IS NOT AN APPRENTICE STRONG SENIOR DIRECTOR CHILDREN NOW. WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR WE ARE ALSO OPPOSE LISTEN AND THINK. THANK YOU I DON'T BRING IT BACK. LET ME ASK WHAT ARE YOUR ONLY CONCERNS THE WILLIAMS LAWSUIT. YEAH. THE DETAILS OF THAT ARE REPORTED AT THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL AS A RESULT OF THE WILLIAM SETTLEMENT AND BETTER AND THE LEGISLATION MORE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S IN THE. IN IN THE DASHBOARD SO YES AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY. THE ONLY THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT. CURRENTLY CAN'T POPULATE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO I'M SORRY. WHAT INFORMATION DO THEY NOT COLLECT THEY DON'T COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTUAL TEXT AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS WHETHER THEY ARE ALIGNED TO STANDARDS AND WHETHER THEY ARE CURRENT? LAW THEY DON'T COLLECT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SEEKING. THAT'S PART OF IT THERE'S OTHER FACILITIES LIKE IS THE BATHROOMS OF AND YET RIGHT FACILITY FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THAT'S RIGHT WELL. IN THE FACILITIES A AREA. EACH SCHOOL GOES THROUGH BY. FACILITIES INSPECTION REVIEW OR SOMETHING. RIGHT. AND SOMETIMES UP WELL THEY'RE REQUIRED TO REPORT WHETHER FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN INSPECTED ARE IN FAIR GOOD OR POOR CONDITION. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT DOESN'T MATCH UP TO WHAT THE REPORT IN THE DASHBOARD AND I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS MY STATE HERE COMPORTS WITH WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT BY THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL SOME OF THIS BECAUSE? I KNOW IN MY OWN CLASSROOM SETTING. EVERY CHILD HAD A TEXT BOOK TO TAKE HOME THAT WE DID BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT TEXTBOOK THAT WE ASSIGN WORK OUT OF A HOME. SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THOSE TEXTBOOKS AVAILABLE CLASSROOM. SO I JUST. BE CAREFUL AYE NICE HOPE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW THIS IMPACTS LOGISTICS ON THE GROUND. ON THE MIGHT OF TO TEXT FOR CLASS THEY MIGHT KNOW ONLY. NOT NOT HAVE ENOUGH IN THE SCHOOLS DISTRICT MIGHT NOT BY ENOUGH I HAVE TO HAVE AN IN CLASS AT THAT'S WHERE I REALLY. BECAME FRUSTRATED IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE THEY HAD A HOME. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T BRING YOUR CLUB BRING YOUR TEXTBOOK TO AYE WELL YOU KNOW YOU'RE AN EIGHTH GRADE YOU MIGHT. OKAY SO. IN OUR CONFERENCE I JUST HOPE WE'RE NOT GETTING TO PARTICULAR AND AND WALKING OUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN RATHER THAN UNLOCKING THE MEN. YOU KNOW A ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIR O'DONNELL WE LOOKED WE TALKED ABOUT THOSE ISSUES IN THE SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS. AND SO THE LEGISLATION SAYS A TEXTBOOK TO USE IN CLASS AND TO TAKE HOME BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE TWO SETS. ALL IT WAS A BUT IT WAS ABOUT ENSURE AND OR. IF IT GOT THAT OR WORDS PRETTY IMPORTANT. IT IT WAS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS IN THE LOWEST RESOURCE SCHOOLS. HAD MATERIALS TOO USED TO REFER TO FOR HOMEWORK BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THEY COULD NOT. REALLY ACCEPTABLE POSITION EYES THAT WERE OR MIGHT BE SOME MEDIA THINK ABOUT BECAUSE. ANDERSON AT HOME THAT CAN USE IN THE CLASSROOM AND YOU NEED TO USE IN THE CLASSROOM RIGHT. YOU KNOW. THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. OR THAT MR GRAHAM DID ANY OF THE FOLKS AND SUPPORTS ONE. RESPOND TO THIS NOTION THAT THEY'LL BE LASTS A USABLE. DATA AVAILABLE WITH THIS WITH THIS CHANGE ARE SEEKING. I HAVE MY NERVES UNDER CONTROL YES IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT UNDER PRIORITY ONE IN THE LC F. F. WE ARE ABLE TO DOCUMENT IN A NARRATIVE THE EXACT AMOUNT OF. AFFORD THAT WE PUT IN OUR START AT THIS TIME. AND IT WOULD NOT IT WOULD JUST BE DAY CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS AS TO HOW WE DO THAT WITH OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT'S IN THE DISTRICT LOADED AREA THAT THEY UPLOAD. SKINNER JEWISH TO COME. YES I. I WOULD SAY THAT THE DIRECTION FROM THE DEPARTMENT IN ITS TECHNICAL MANUAL. GUIDANCE ON THE LOCAL INDICATORS IS TO USE THE STARK INFORMATION. SO THE LOCAL INDICATORS WOULD BE AT THIS POINT ARE DISTRICT LEVEL REPORTS. AND THEY'RE NOT SCHOOL LEVEL DATA WHICH IS WHAT THE WILLIAMS SETTLEMENT REQUIRES REMEMBER THE STATE SAID WE DON'T HAVE SCHOOL LEVEL INFORMATION. EXCEPT FOR THE STARK AND THAT'S WHY. THESE. METRICS THESE INDICATORS WERE PUT INTO THE STARK. SO LET ME ASK YOU QUESTIONS ACT LIKE. SO SO SHE'S TALKING ABOUT DISTRICT LEVEL I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL LEVEL. BONTA IOWA PLASTER OF COSTUMES. THAT HAD IT BEEN A MONOPOLY HAS AN IMPACT DOES OKAY. TO ME THAT'S MY BECAUSE I'M I'M I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT AND THAT IS IMPORTANT TO BE WRONG. BUT I WANNA KNOW WHAT TOOLS I HAVE WHEN I WALK IN THE CLASSROOM IN THE MORNING. AND EVEN FOR MY OWN CHILDREN AND OUTSIDE OF MOSCOW UNDER WILLIAMS TEACHERS AND STAFF ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE LEARNING AND TEACHING CONDITIONS. AND THAT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR IN THE LEGISLATION AROUND THE UNIFORM COMPLAINT PROCEDURE. THANK YOU AYE SO I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. IT'S OUR COMMITMENT THANK YOU KNOW YES I JUST I JUST WANTED TO OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION. WE SHOULD NEVER MINIMIZE IMPORTANCE OF THE WILLIAMS CASE. IT IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CASE AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE AT THE STATE LEVEL OR EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WANT TO HAVE TO OPEN IT UP AGAIN. BECAUSE IT IS VERY SERIOUS AND IT REALLY GETS DOWN TO THE MOST BASIC LEVELS OF INEQUALITY THAT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT AND THE OUTCOMES OF THAT. SO THOSE OF US WHO LIVED THROUGH THE WILLIAMS CASE AT ONE LEVEL OF THE OTHER REALIZED JUST HOW IMPORTANT IS AND. AND SARK IS REALLY THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THE DATA IS FOUND. AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SOME I KNOW THAT. OF OUR BROUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T ELIMINATE WHAT IS SO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ABSOLUTELY ABDUCTOR WHERE BUT JUST FOR CLARIFICATION I KNOW THAT BOTH OF US ARE EDUCATORS I SPENT SIXTEEN YEARS IN THE CLASSROOM. UNDERSTAND THE WILLIAMS ACT ON THE WILLIAMS AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATE THOUGH THOUGH WILLIAMS INSPECTIONS THAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WHEN I WAS A CLASSROOM TEACHER WE HAD. SCHEDULED VISITS AND WE ALSO HAD I'M I'M SCHEDULED IT'S VISITS WHEN THEY SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ELIMINATED THIS IS ABOUT THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED SO. SO SO WE'RE WORKING ON THE DATA BUT THE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE WILLIAMS IS NOT GOING TO BE ELIMINATED AND THE WILLIAMS VISIT THAT'S VERY SEPARATE. SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET RID OF THE WILLIAMS. ACT. WE'RE STILL VISITING SCHOOLS WE HAVE GROUPS TEAMS THAT WILL VISIT THE SCHOOLS AND THE REPORTING WILL BE DONE IT'S STILL REQUIRED BY THE COUNTIES IS STILL REQUIRED BY ALL CFF. SO WE HAVE ALL THIS REQUIREMENT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILLS TO STREAMLINE THE INFORMATION AND I ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK BUT THIS IS ABOUT STREAMLINING NOT ELIMINATING THE WILLIAMS. LAWSUIT WHICH IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS YEAH I I THINK THE CONCERN WAS WITH AN UP THE DATA WOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE STOCK REPORT RIGHT THAT EVEN THOUGH THE VISITS OCCUR THE DATA IS COLLECTED IS IT GOING TO BE ALL SOLD. OUT REPORTED IN THAT BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS. VERY FEW OTHER PLACES ARE NOT PLEASE REALLY WHERE YOU CAN FIND THE REPORT FROM THE FROM THE WILLIAMS INVESTIGATIONS AT THE CURRENT SCHOOLS SO I KNOW YOU WORK ON IT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER GREAT UP THANK YOU YOU KNOW LAWSUITS DATA ALL YOU KNOW I GET AT THE SAME TIME STILL REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS REFLECTS WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE GROUND. IN THE CLASSROOM THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE THE CLASS AND THE TEACHER EXPERIENCE THE CLASSROOM SO THAT WE CAN ALL CAN SUCCEED. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I SEE NO FURTHER COMMENTS I DO WE HAVE A MOTION THAT WE DID. SO MOVE. IF THE MOVE AND SECONDED BY MISTER STEINORTH. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS YOU MAY CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS AS THE MOTION. O'DONNELL AYE O'DONNELL AYE JEFF AND MATT DOCTOR WEBER IS GOING TO GO AND THEN. CHIU. LOOK SO HAPPY OUT THERE IS NEXT AFTER DOCTOR WEBER. OF FOR ALLOWING US TO GO WE HAVE SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE BEEN HERE ALL DAY. AND UP TO THE LONG HEARING AND THEY HAVE A FLIGHT TO CATCH SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY. DON'T MISS THAT MOMMY JUST WERE UP THIS IS A FILE ITEM. BALONEY. S. HERE. FILE I'M TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO YES TWENTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN AND I'M TWENTY TWO A. B.. TWENTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN TWENTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN. RIGHT OKAY. BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT EXCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK BOTH CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK TO IMPROVE THE BILL. AMENDMENTS WERE LARGELY TECHNICAL IN A CLARIFY SEVERAL DEFINITIONS AND WILL MAKE IMPLEMENTATION MUCH EASIER. UMP AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO KEEP CHILDREN ESPECIALLY CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN SAFE IN SCHOOLS. OF YOUR HAVING A TWO DOCUMENTS TWO HANDS OUT THE HANDOUTS PAST YOU AT THIS TIME OF THAT COME FROM THE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. BUT DECADE SAW EDUCATORS ADVOCATES AND LEGISLATORS HAVE WORK TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WITH WITH CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS. ARE EDUCATED WITH DIGNITY AND SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS IN FACT CALIFORNIA WAS ONCE THE LEADER IN ADDRESSING STUDENTS WITH CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS ENACTING LEGISLATION IN NINETEEN NINETY THE HUGHES APP AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY SIX. THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WITH SEVERE BEHAVIOR CHALLENGES HOWEVER AS A RESPONSE TO THE RECESSION THE LEGISLATURE'S PART OF THE TWENTY THIRTEEN BUDGET. REPEALED A LONG STANDING REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE HUGE REAL AND CODIFIED A LIST OF EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS PREVIOUSLY PROHIBITED UNDER THE HUGHES BILL INCLUDING LOCKED OCCLUSION AND MECHANICAL RESTRAINING. FOR ALL LIAM SCIENCE SIMULTANEOUSLY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BEST AGAINST REPORTS AND PARENTS REPORTS DOCUMENT THAT CURRENT LAW FAILS TO CONTROL THE USE OF RESTRAINTS AND SECLUSION IN SCHOOL. STUDENTS CONTINUE TO SUFFER TRAUMA AND EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL HARM. SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS TEND TO BE TARGETED MORE FOR RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION JUST REPORTS ON A PACK CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES IN AFRICAN AMERICAN BOYS. AS ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IN THE LAST MONTH THE US GENERAL ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE CONFIRMS THAT THESE TWO POPULATIONS OF TARGET FISCAL DISCIPLINE. WE HAVE PASSED OUT TO DOCUMENTS TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. CALIFORNIA USED TO BE A LEADER AS I POINTED OUT. IN THE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS OF THE FIRSTSIDE OF TRIED ONE HANDED OUT DESCRIBES ELEVEN POLICIES TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RESTRAINTS AND SECLUSION IN SCHOOLS. CALIFORNIA SCORED A THREE OUT OF ELEVEN DEMONSTRATING THAT WE ARE NO LONGER A LEADER IN POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTION. THE OTHER HAND OUT PROVIDES A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN SCHOOLS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THESE ALL COME FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA INVESTIGATIONS ALTHOUGH THE NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED. pBEHAVIOR INTERVENTION OVER DANGEROUS DISCIPLINARY TECHNIQUES FOR PROVIDE THE SCHOOL PROTOCOLS ON THE USE OF RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION IN SCHOOLS. I WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A STUDENT AS WELL AND YOU KNOW THE STUDENT HAS ASTHMA. YOU SHOULD NOT PUSH THE STUDENT DOWN ON THE FLOOR IN A PROMO STRAIGHT RESTRAINT THAT WILL RESTRICT BREATHING. IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY WERE STUDENT BEHAVIOR PRESENTS AN IMMINENT DANGER OF SCHOOL PHYSICAL HARM TO IS TO SELF OR OTHERS THEN THE USE OF RESTRAINTS PERMISSIBLE. FOR MOST STUDENTS ARE OTHER WAYS TO IMPROVE BEHAVIOR AND YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY TO TO CONFIRM THAT. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN IS LESLIE MORRISON THE DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AND EDUARDO MIGUEL MIGUEL FROM PORT FEEL ACADEMY. YOU CAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M LESLIE MORRISON I'M DIRECTOR OF THE INVESTIGATIONS UNIT AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA'S THE PROUD SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND WE THANK DOCTOR WEBER FOR AUTHORING AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN. I STARTED MY CAREER AS A REGISTERED NURSE AND I HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE IN PSYCHIATRIC NURSING IN A USED TO RUN IN PATIENT ACUTE PSYCH PROGRAMS THAT USE RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION. I SAW FIRST HAND THE DANGERS AND TRAUMA THAT RESULTED FROM THESE PRACTICES. I NOW ON THE DIVISION OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THAT CONDUCTS INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE NEGLECT AND WE HAVE DONE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF CASES INVOLVING INJURIES AND DEATHS. RESULTING FROM RESTRAIN SECLUSION INCLUDING INJURIES TO CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS THEY HAND OUT THE DOCTOR WEBER MENTION IS JUST A HANDFUL WE COUNTED ON NEARLY A THIRTY FIVE CASES THAT WE'VE DONE. IT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA ALONE. THESE ARE DANGEROUS PRACTICES THAT CAN CAUSE INJURY AND DEATH. AS DOCTOR WEBER SAID THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE USE OF RESTRAINTS SECLUSION WE WANT TO KEEP CHILDREN SAFE AND NOTHING IN THIS BILL LIMITS ARE PROHIBITS STAFF FROM USING RESTRAINT SECLUSION TO STOP IMMINENTLY DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR. IT PROVIDES PROTOCOLS TO HELP GUIDE THE SAFE USE OF RESTRAINTS SECLUSION IN THE RARE INSTANCE WHERE IT IS REQUIRED. IT APPLIES THE SAME STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT WE SEE IN OTHER CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT EXTEND TO OTHER PLACES WERE RESTRAINED SECLUSION IS USED INCLUDING HOSPITALS NURSING HOMES GROUP HOMES COMMUNITY CENTERS. MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES AND STATE FACILITIES. IT SETS MINUTE THE BILL SETS MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS AND PROTECTIONS FOR WATER KNOWN DANGEROUS TECHNIQUES BUT IT DOES-NOT STOP TEACHERS FROM INTERVENE TO KEEP A CHILD SAFE. CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS SERVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT OTHER INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE WHEN THEY'RE SUBJECTED TO RESTRAIN SECLUSION AND IT'S ESPECIALLY IN FOR IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY'RE A PARTICULAR RISK OF INJURY AND DEATH FROM THE THESE PRACTICES. AS DOCTOR WEBER MENTION CALIFORNIA HAS FALLEN BEHIND WHERE WE WILL ONCE A LEADER AND HOW TO HANDLE CHILDREN WITH CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS. THIS BILL WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA LAW UP TO DATE WITH THE REFORMS ENACTED BY DOZENS OF OTHER STATES AND THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION GUIDELINES. AND THAT'S THE OTHER HAND OF THE DOCTOR WEBER. PROVIDED YOU. IT'S TIME TO MEET THESE MINIMUM NATIONAL STANDARDS AND BRING CALIFORNIA IN LINE WITH STANDARDS ADOPTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IT'S TIME TO PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH THE SAME PROTECTIONS EVERYONE ELSE. EXPOSED TO THESE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PRACTICES RECEIVE LIKELY CERTAINLY SUMMERS I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU AND KEEP IT TWO MINUTES PLEASE. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MINERS DOCTOR EVER MIGUEL AND I'M BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS IN A DOCTOR OF EDUCATION. HOW THE FOODS OF SERVING QUE TO TWENTY TWO STUDENTS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AS A FOUNDER AND PRINCIPAL FOR FEW PREPARATORY? A NONPUBLIC SCHOOL WITH CAMPUSES AN ORANGE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES. WE SERVE OVER THIRTY DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO RELY ON US TO EDUCATE UP TO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE STUDENTS AT A TIME. WAS SEVERE CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS. MY NATIONAL TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE INCLUDED USING SECLUSION ROOM DEMONSTRATES AS PART OF A STRATEGY. I SAW FIRST HAND HOW DANGEROUS AND TERM DRAMATIC THESE TECHNIQUES ARE IN BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS. AND KEEPING KIDS SAFE. NOW HAVING EDUCATED STUDENTS WITHOUT THE USE OF SUCH EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY HARMFUL TECHNIQUES FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND PROVING IT WORKS I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT THERE'S A BETTER WAY. A MORE HUMANE WAY FOR STUDENTS TO THRIVE BEYOND RESTRAINT. THE BEHAVIOR THAT WE SEE A POOR BUREAU WHO STUDENT BITING THEMSELVES UNTIL SEVERE BLEEDING OCCURS RECLINED SUTURES. PUNCHING THEMSELVES IN THE PLACE UNTIL THEY BLEED OR BONES ARE BROKEN. PULLING THEIR HAIR OUT OF THEIR HEAD SMEARING FECES ATTEMPTED HE'D HARMFUL ITEMS INCLUDING FECES. PROPERTY DESTRUCTION URINATING STRIPPING NAKED JUST TO NAME A FEW. THERE'S ALMOST ALWAYS REPEAT BEHAVIORS AT A PREDICTABLE AND CAN BE ANTICIPATED AS A STUDENTS REACTION TO CERTAIN STIMULI. THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS THAT ARE REFERRED TO US HAVE HISTORIES OF BEING RESTRAINED. IN SOME CASES SEVERAL TIMES PER DAY AND OVER THIRTY TIMES PER MONTH. OUR FOCUS IS TO ALLOW OUR STUDENTS TO LEARN AND GROW. WE DO THIS WITHOUT RESTRAINT OR SECLUSION BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK IT DOESN'T TEACH BUT IT DOES INJURE AND IT DOES KILL. THIS BILL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT WHAT NO STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO EXPERIENCE IN A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. WHICH INCLUDES STUDENTS BEING RESTRAINED OR SECLUDED WHERE THE RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH IS SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED. AB TWO SIX FIVE SEVEN PROMOTES POSITIVE ACCOUNTABLE LEARNING AND PROHIBITS STUDENTS FROM BEING HELD DOWN AND DANGEROUS POSITIONS BEING ISOLATED AND UNOBSERVED. RESTRAINED BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE AND FOR LONG PERIODS IN AN EFFORT TO PUNISH CHILDREN COLORS CHILDREN EXTORT CHILDREN OR AS A MEANS OF CONVENIENCE. THE BILL RECOGNIZES EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION MAY BE NEEDED AND DOES NOT PREVENT STAFF FROM USING STRAIGHT OR SECLUSION WHEN THE RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH IS IMMINENT.

THANK YOU ANY OPPOSITION. GOV OR. US CENTER BORRERO CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL A WE HAVE CONCERNS AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. WE ONLY RECENTLY RAISE THE SCOOBIES CONCERNS SO ALL I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHORS OFFICE WILLING TO ADDRESS THEM. OUR CONCERNS INVOLVED A STAFF PERSON THAT'S FORM BEHAVIOR RESTRAINTBEING PRESIDENT THE MEETING THANK YOU THANK YOU GREAT. OTHER SPREE BOXING NO OTHER OPPOSITION. YOU CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS BILL BECAUSE I'M. YOU KNOW ME DOCTOR WEBER I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS MY CONCERN IS THAT WE TRY AND MICROMANAGE SCHOOL SITES. FROM SACRAMENTO DOES ME THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET STAFF TRAIN. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS. BE PROACTIVE. AND NOT REACT TO NOT PUNISH KIDS BY RESTRAINT PUNISHED BUT I DON'T WANT TO. TIED DOWN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. BUT I COME FROM THE REAL WORLD QUOTE UNQUOTE WHERE I SEE KIDS GET IN FIGHTS. RIGHT AT LUNCH TIME GIRLS OF THE WORST BY THE WAY RAMEN LEGAL AND IT MAY HAVE A GO AT IT. THEM THIS ADVICE IS TRUE. AND THE THE MOTIONS ARE AND RIGHT AND. AND SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND FROM FROM SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT A SCHOOL WHY THIS IS A GOOD IDEA TO GET. I GET THAT I DON'T WANT SOMEONE. GIVE A HAND CUPPED ANYTHING FOR FOR HOURS FOR PUNISHMENT I MEAN LIKE THAT. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT. COOL SAYS SOME AT A SCHOOL SITES ABILITY TO INTERVENE. AND CONTROL SITUATION THEN THE PUNISHMENT'S ON THE PUNISH SITE PICKED UP IS THAT NOT WHAT ABOUT. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTERVENTION YOU GOT TWO KIDS GOING AT IT. YOU KNOW YOU GOT. SEVERAL THOUSAND KIDS OUT THERE AND LUNCH TIME YOU'VE GOTTA STOP THE SITUATION QUICKLY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GROW IF YOU DON'T. IF YOU DON'T REACT. THAT MAYBE A BIGGER PROBLEM HERE YOU JUST CAN'T SIT THERE WATCH KIDS FIGHT AND IS THIS GOING TO HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT. ON OUR STEPS WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH KIDS INTO CONTROL SITUATIONS THAT MIGHT ALREADY. BE OUT OF HAND. I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT FIGHTS AND AT THE PLAYGROUND AT LUNCH TIME THOSE THINGS MAY HAPPEN IN AND OFTENTIMES THERE OF SECURITY FOLKS THAT IT THERE. TO HANDLE THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES AND TO AND TO AND TO ENGAGE IT WE'RE PROBABLY TALKING MORE IN TERMS OF STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS WEBER. OF WHO BASICALLY ARE A AND CLASSROOMS WHO NEED VARIOUS KINDS OF ACTIVITIES DONE TO KEEP THEM FROM. BASICALLY HURTING THEMSELVES OR HURTING SOMEONE ELSE AND SO IT'S A BUT AS POINTED OUT. BUT WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY TO DO RESTRAINTS IF THAT'S NECESSARY OUGHT TO BASICALLY ENGAGE AT THAT LEVEL BUT WE'RE SAYING THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT AS A. EDUCATOR IN A CLASSROOM AND ANNA SCHOOL SIDE IF YOU'RE OUT IN THE SCHOOL SITE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT YOU CAN USE TO NOT HAVE TO RESTRAIN CHILDREN. TO TIE THEM DOWN INTO TO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND I THINK OUR EXPERT WITNESS HERE WHO HAS A SCHOOL WHO'S DEALT WITH THOSE. CHILDREN AND IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION OF HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE NEED TO DO IT. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SAD THINGS OFTEN TO HAPPENINGS IS AS WE SAY DO WE REALLY NEED TO DO THIS WHAT WE REALLY DO BECAUSE. IF OFTENTIMES WE HAVE BECOME LAX IN IT WHEN WE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ONE WE DID HAVE RESOURCES HOPEFULLY TO PROBABLY TO TRAIN PEOPLE. AND AS A RESULT WHEN YOU DON'T SAY THINGS AND YOU HAVE NEW POPULATION THE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE SCHOOLS TO WORK. YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM THE INFORMATION AND THE AND THE GUIDELINES IN THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED. SO THEREFORE THINGS GO AWRY. THEN WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH THE SITUATION SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPENS. THEN PEOPLE COME UP TO US AND ASK US WHY IS IT SOME CHILD DIED ON A CAMPUS WIDE TO SOME KID WAS HOSPITALIZED Y. THE SOME. HERE HAVE THEIR BACK BROKEN OR SOMETHING FROM PEOPLE SITTING ON THEM AND TRYING TO HOLD THEM ON THE GROUND I MEAN WIPE Y. BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED A POSITIVE. APPROACH TO IT AFFRONT PREVENTING RATHER THAN WAITING TO AFTER THE FACT OF TRY TO CURE SOMETHING. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. AND HELL IF YOU WILL BE VERY WHEN HIS COMMENTS BECAUSE YOU IN A SAVINGS DON'T DON'T YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR. DO CHIU SYRUP PARTICULAR. A PARTICULAR PART OUR STUDENT POPULATION AT YOUR SCHOOL SITE OR YOU HAVE. ALL TYPES OF STUDENTS IN YOUR SCHOOL. WE SERVE ARM ALL THE WAY FROM SEVERELY DISABLED TO MODERN DESIGN SO SIMILAR QUESTION REACH ON I'M GONNA I'M GONNA GET THAT YOU TALK WITH. THAT'S MY CONCERN IS I I THINK. IT SEEMS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENT IP SIX ADDRESS. AND I GET I GET THAT. BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT STUDENTS WITHOUT IP STUDENTS THAT ARE NOT SPECIAL NEEDS IT SEEMS PRETTY BROAD. AND I DON'T WANT AGAIN ANY STUDENT TO BE RESTRAINED. ESPECIALLY FOR PUNISHMENT. OF MY CONCERNS WERE TALKING WE SEEM TO BE FOCUSING ON. A YOU KNOW STE JUST SOME OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION AND YET IF THE BILL APPLIES TO ALL OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION. IF I COULD JUST JUMP IN THIS BILL REALLY DOES NOT ALLOW A DOES NOT PROHIBIT A TEACHERS FROM JUMPING IN TO BREAK UP THE KIND OF A FIGHT THAT YOU WOULD. YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT DOESN'T STOP A TEACHER FROM GRABBING A FIVE YEAR OLD IS RUNNING INTO TRAFFIC WHAT IT DOES STOP IS USING PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS TECHNIQUES THAT WE KNOW ENSURING KILL THAT ARE PROHIBITED EVERYPLACE ALL TO RESTRAIN SECLUSION ARE USED. SO. IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT THE KIND OF. JUST IT YOU KNOW INCIDENTS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING. PART OF THE REASON WHY WE HAVE AN AND DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA HAS DONE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF CASES WHERE KIDS TO RESTRAIN SECLUDED NOT BECAUSE THEY POSE AN IMAGE IMMINENT RISK BECAUSE. THEY WOULDN'T STAY SEATED IN THEIR CHAIR FOR AN HOUR DURING. A CLASSROOM EXERCISE ON THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT I GET I GET I GET THAT COMPONENT I'M JUST WORRIED BOUT THE MUCH BROADER PICTURE APPROACHED THIS BILL HAS TODAY. SO THIS BILL AGAIN DOES NOT PREVENT TEACHERS FROM INTERVENING ON IT JUST PROHIBITS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS PRACTICES AND IT REQUIRES THAT THE CHILD'S BEHAVIOR POSE A RISK BEFORE. A TEACHER INTERVENE. AND THE REASON WHY IT'S NOT JUST A SPECIAL EDUCATION BILL AS WE THINK THAT THESE PROTECTIONS SHOULD APPLY TO ALL STUDENTS. ON DATA COLLECTED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SHOWS THAT GENERAL ED STUDENTS ARE EXPOSED TO THESE PRACTICES JUST AS MUCH AS SPECIAL ED STUDENTS ARE LEAST EXPOSED. WE CERTAINLY KNOW SOME OF THE DATA SHOWS THAT SPECIAL ED STUDENTS ARE EXPOSED MUCH MORE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ART DOT CONTINUED SAYS I JUST TODAY I'M NOT CONVINCED. THAT I'M WORRIED THAT THIS IS TOO BROAD. AND I UNDERSTAND WHEN IS AN IEP AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT ONLY STUDENTS OF A YOU KNOW. OF UP ONLY A SPECIFIC PART ARE STERN POPULATION OR SCHOOL I THINK. THIS IS A BETTER FIT. I WONDER IF IT'S THE BEST FIT. FOR FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION AND AGAIN. LET ME CLARIFY I DON'T WANT ANYONE RESTRAINT BUT AT THE SAME TIME. AND WHEN YOU HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE VIOLENT VIOLENT SITUATION INTERACTIONS SAID YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE SOME ABILITY. TO TO TO AND THAT. THAT. INTERACTION. THAT THANK YOU. AND I THINK THE IN THE BILL ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW BUT OFTENTIMES A RESTRAINT TO USE NOT BECAUSE A PERSON IS OF A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR SOMEONE ELSE. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ITS SCHOOLS WENT BITES OF OCCURRED AND AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER ACTUALLY GOT HIM STOP THE FIGHT. I'D NEVER GO ANYBODY ON THE GROUND. LOW BUT THEY WERE FIGHTING IN NEARBY ACT LIKE THEY WAS SCARED SO I WENT BROKE THEM UP. YOU KNOW OF. YOU KNOW BUT OUT AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW I'VE ALSO SEEN PEOPLE TAKE KIDS IMPLEMENTED BROWN BECAUSE A KID KEPT TOPONYMIC COULDN'T STOP HIM FROM TALKING. YOU KNOW THEY HAD TO GET THE LAST WORD IN AND THEY WERE RUNNING THEIR MOUTH AND THE TEACHER GOT UPSET TO INCLUDE KID AGAINST A WALL AND THURMOND GROUNDED SAT ON A. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS OFTENTIMES OF THE PERSON TO STUDENT WASN'T A DANGER TO. BUT ANYBODY ELSE AND THEY JUST RUN INTO MY HOUSE AND SOMETIMES THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THEY KNOW HOW TO STOP OF ONE RESTRAIN WHATEVER IT WAS. SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE FACT THAT THE PERSON IS THAT IS IS. ALL IS IS HURTING THEMSELVES OF SOMEONE ELSE'S THAT THIS IS A STRATEGY THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED UNLESS THERE IS A SITUATION OF DANGER. AND YOU'RE TO PREVENT SOMETHING FROM HER HAPPENING THAT'S THEIR. YOU KNOW WE AS A SOCIETY HAVE TO BEGIN TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT IT'S OFTENTIMES THERE'S DISPROPORTIONATE TREATMENT AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF FEDERAL REPORTS HAVE SHOWN THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE THROWN ON THE GROUND AND TO BE. THE ONLY GETS WALL SO IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US WHEN WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY BECOME ADULTS. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THOSE LEVELS OF RESTRAINTS AND AND ACTIVITIES THAT IT THERE AND OFFICE ALSO THERE MORE OFTEN LIKELY TO BE CLASSIFIED A SPECIAL LIVE WHY BECAUSE BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS. NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF ACADEMIC PROBLEMS BUT BECAUSE OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT BEGIN TO ADDRESS THIS EARLY IN LIFE WE HAVE TO START IN THE SCHOOLS AND MAKE THIS A PART OF IT. AND THE HUGHES BILL THAT PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY WAS REALLY ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD US RECOGNIZING THE FACT THAT WE COULD DO SOMETHING BETTER. IN THE STATE AND YOU LOOK AT THE LIST AND YOU SEE WHERE ALL THE STATES ARE WHO USING THE VARIOUS KINDS OF RESTRAINTS AND WHO HAVE CERTAIN POLICIES IN PLACE. CALIFORNIA'S AT THE BOTTOM OF WE HAVE GIVEN UP OUR PLACE WHAT WE ONCE WERE THE PREMIER PLACE IN TERMS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF KIDS AND WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO ONCE AGAIN. GO BACK TO THAT AND REBUILD IT AND DISABILITY RIGHTS ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZES OF. CLEARLY THAT IT HAPPENED SIGNIFICANTLY BUT KIDS WOULD SPECIALLY BUT ALSO SOMETIMES FOR OTHERS BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT TO DO RESTRAINTS IF IT SMELLS LIKE YOU ANY ANY OTHERS FROM THE COMMITTEE WISH TO CALL. TO KILEY OUT SO I'M STRUGGLING WITH THE CHILD LIKE CHARM FROM THIS A LITTLE BIT TOO I IT IT SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE HERE THAT WE'RE ALL. AGREEING ON AND THAT'S THE RESTRAINTS ARE SECLUSION. SHOULD NOT BE USED EXCEPT. YOU KNOW IN IN EXIT HE'S OVER THERE IS AN EMERGENCY I DON'T HAVE A FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE SORT OF MENU OF. POLICY LIMITATIONS THAT. APPEAR TO BE A COMEDY VARYING DEGREES IN DIFFERENT STATES I'M SPENT WONDERING WHERE THESE PARTICULAR. POLICY LIMITATIONS COME FROM AND WHY I'M HAVING TROUBLE CAN IT JUDGING OKAY I DID ARE THESE DOZEN OR HOWEVER MANY THERE ARE IN THIS BILL. THE RIGHT ONES THAT WE WON'T HAVE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO. CHANGE PRACTICE IN A POSITIVE WAY SO THIS POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS CAME THAT FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THEY ISSUED A GUIDANCE A FIFTEEN RECOMMENDED. GUIDELINES THAT STATES SHOULD IMPLEMENT AND SO WE. THEN LOOKED AT THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S ANALYSIS OF HOW EVERY STATE IS DOING AND PUT IT TOGETHER A CHART FORM SAID THESE ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ABOUT WHAT SCHOOLS. A STATE SHOULD ADOPT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENT. MR THEM. CLAIMS CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE. CONSTERNATION AND AND PEOPLE WHO'VE RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT BALANCE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF WHERE REALLY THE SECTORS HAVE BEEN GOING TO SAY THAT. WE SHOULD BE USING RESTRAINT ON THEIR KIDS. EVEN FOR KIDS WHO HAVE SEVERE NEEDS THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO REDIRECT BEHAVIOR. AND AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN OUT RESTRAINT HAS BEEN RELIED UPON THERE HAVE BEEN SERIOUS INCIDENTS AND THAT HAVE LED TO SERIOUS HERE INJURY. AND TRAUMA. FOR ME AND SO WHILE WE ALWAYS STRUGGLE HOW TO INTERVENE IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION I THINK WE HAVE TO SAY. THAT. WE WANT TO LIMIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE ASKING SOMEONE TO PUT THEIR HANDS ON SOME. AS A WAY OF REDIRECTING. BEHAVIOR THAT IS EITHER TYPICAL BEHAVIOR FOR THAT STUDENT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THAT STUDENTS LEVEL OF. PRACTICE BEHAVIOR FUNCTION IS BUT WE WE WHEN WE PUT OUR HANDS ON KIDS AND I IF THERE ISN'T ONE ALREADY MISS CHARO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS. THANK YOU. TO MOVE TO SECOND IT UP PLEASE CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR CONCERNS AND AS POINTED OUT THESE ARE. YOU KNOW THESE ARE GUIDELINES THAT HAVE COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS TO HOW WE SHOULD BE ACTING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND WHAT STATES HAVE ADOPTED. AND WHERE WE STAND YOU KNOW IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING WE HAVE PASSED AN AWFUL LOT OF. BILLS TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. AND HELP LOOK IT WOULD JUST PASS ONE A DAY IN TERMS OF COUNSELING IN MENTAL HEALTH AND ALL THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND HOW OUR KIDS ARE SUFFERING FROM TRAUMA AND THAT'S SO TRUE THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS TO CREATE MORE TRAUMA OR DIDN'T ACCENTUATE THE TRAUMA AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE VOTE. OF FOR IT AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN. RETHINKING THE MOTION IS TO PASS. AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. O'DONNELL NO. O'DONNELL NO KILEY. KILEY NOT VOTING. KALRA. MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE STEINORTH. THURMOND. THURMOND AYE WEBER AYE WEBER AYE. BILLS THREE VOTES IT IS ON CALL. WITH THAT WILL GO TO. MISTER CHIU. THAT'S AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE SEE. PLEASE PROCEED TOOK A VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AMY SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE. REQUIRES ALL HIGH SCHOOL TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON COLLEGE OPTIONS CREEK SCHOOL OPTIONS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCIAL AID. TO EVERY STUDENT AT LEAST ONCE TO INTEGRATE NIGHT TO TWELVE. IT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY TO SCHOOLS ON HOW THIS INFORMATION COULD BE PROVIDED. AS STUDY SHOWS THAT. EDUCATED WORKER EARNS MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT MORE DAN DOES WAS ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. AND THIS IS ALSO AN INCREASED DEMAND AND SKILLED WORKERS A BIG OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOL IS JUST AN IMPORTANT S. COLLEGE. BECAUSE COLLEGE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE LETTING KIDS KNOW THE OPTION THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM COULDHELP THEM MAKE BETTER DECISIONS REGARDING TO YOUR. CAREER PATH HERE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS ESERVER THOUGH GUS GARCIA WAS WHO CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. AND DURING THE US GERMISTON US WAS JUST A BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL.

UNFORTUNATELY MANY SCHOOL SITES LACK THE SUFFICIENT FINDING. I FOR THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF COUNSELORS FOR THEIR STUDENT RATIOS. SO THIS BILL HELPS FILL IN THE GAPS OF INFORMATION FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE BILL UNDERSCORES. THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE OF OF CAREER AND COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS FOR OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM BUT BUT ESPECIALLY. IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. IN SHORT CTA SUPPORTS THE BILL'S FOCUS FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO ACADEMIC CONCURRENT FORMATION TO BETTER PREPARE STUDENTS TO SUCCEED AND OUR STATE AND NATIONAL ECONOMY. SO WE URGE ARRIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRTH COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. WE ARE OUT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY.

RIDICULOUS EDUCATION CENTER GRANT FUNDING TO THE KIDS CONNECTION OF CLASSES. THAT THIS BILL AIMS TO OUT TO TELL ABOUT THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES ON SUPPORT. WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. THEY WERE HOME. CAMPBELL IN THEM. QUESTION THE COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE ONE QUESTION THE. CHIU SO IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS ALREADY IN THE EDUCATION CODE. A SIMILAR. PROVISION THAT REQUIRES. THIS SORT OF INFORMATION BE SENT OUT ACTUALLY EVERY YEAR. THIS IS EDUCATION CODE. FIVE ONE TWO TWO NINE ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THIS AND WHAT IS YES I THINK THAT. REQUIRED SCHOOL TO SEND OUT A NOTICE TO THE PARENT. AND I'D INFORMATION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THREE POSSIBLE PORT FORWARD TO FINANCIAL EIGHT. SO DOES BILL WILL OF WOULD REQUIRED TO SCHOOL TO SEND IT DIRECTLY TO THE STUDENT. AND ALSO PROVIDES HOME FOR NAY IF OF FINANCIAL AID ASSISTANCE INFORMATION. THANKS ART WE WILL HAVE REAL GOOD CONTROL. OF WHAT DID MOVEMENT. IT HAPPENED IN THEIR HOME SO I WANT TO STUDENT WHO RECEIVED THE. THE STYLE OF THEIR PARENTS TO RECEIVE. I SEE SO GOES TO STUDENT RATHER THAN THE PARENTS AND I HAVE TWO YOUNG.

THURMOND. THURMOND AYE WEBER. WEBER AYE. THREE WISHES. OLD WE NEED IT IF. WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO A REVIEW ON THAT WHAT I DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. NOW WE DO ALRIGHT LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN. O'DONNELL KILEY. KILEY NO KALRA MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE STEINORTH. THURMOND THURMOND YE WEBER. WEBER AYE. THANK YOU VERY GOOD NIGHT. THE BILL IS ON COME MS ARLEN EUROPE. IS. ITEM NUMBER. THIRTY ONE EIGHTY THIRTY FORTY EIGHT. THANKS TO. MISTER CHAIR AND MR THURMAN FOR LETTING ME GO IN FRONT AB THIRTY FORTY EIGHT IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM SEEKS TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS TO MONITORS TEACHER CREDENTIALING. CURRENTLY THE MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUST PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT TEACHER CREDENTIALS AND COURSE ASSIGNMENTS TO THEIR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION EVERY FOUR YEARS. THROUGH A MANUAL PROCESS IN THREE SEPARATE DATABASES THIS INFORMATION IS USED TO IDENTIFY MISS ASSIGNMENTS OR TEACHERS WITH THE CREDENTIAL OUTSIDE OF THE CLASS THAT THEY TEACH. UNDER THIS BILL THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE THE DATA THEY ALREADY HAVE TO FIND POTENTIAL MISS ASSIGNMENTS. THEY CAN THEN SEND THESE POTENTIAL THIS ASSIGNMENTS TO COUNTIES TO REVIEW WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SINCE THIS PROCESS WOULD BE AUTOMATED THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR YEARLY TEACHER MONITORING INSTEAD OF EVERY FOUR YEARS. THIS WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO RUN MORE EFFICIENTLY LEE AND PROVIDE GREATER OVERSIGHT OF OUR TEACHER ASSIGNMENTS. HOWEVER THIS IS A BIG CHANGE FROM THE CURRENT PROCESS AND REQUIRES INPUT FROM MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE HELD MULTIPLE MEETINGS WITH THE COMMISSION COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS TEACHERS. AND MANY OTHERS TO CREATE A NEW SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE I'D RITUAL I HAD ORIGINALLY SET OUT TO STREAMLINE AND ONEROUS AN OUTDATED PROCESS. WE HAD A NUMBER OF UP PRODUCTIVE. MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. IN AN ATTEMPT TO RECREATE THIS. COMPLICATES THIS PROCESS AS I UNDERSTAND CERTAIN CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE REQUIRED TO HOLD CREDENTIALS ARE READY BUT THEIR INCLUSION IN THIS KNEW MONITORING PROCESS IS SOMETHING WE COULD OF CONSIDERED ONCE THE NEW. SYSTEM WISE AND PLACE HOWEVER I WILL ACCEPT THIS AND OTHER AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE AND WANT TO THANK THEM FOR ALL THEIR WORK. ON THIS BILL I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THOSE INVOLVED TO CONSOLIDATE THE CREDENTIAL MONITORING INTO ONE SYSTEM AND I HAVE WITH ME HERE IN SUPPORT JOSH WHAT SPARKS FROM THE COMMISSION ON. TEACHER CREDENTIALING. THANK YOU. MEMBERS MAYBE STRUCTURE SPEAKS AND I REPRESENT THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. I WILL TRAVESTY BRIEF THIS IS AN EQUITY ISSUE. EFFECTIVE AND TRANSPARENT ASSIGNMENT MONITORING HELPS ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS GET AN EFFECTIVE IN QUALIFY TEACHER. SO I'LL ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OTHER ISN'T SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HOPE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ISABEL GARCIA. WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WE ARE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION IN RECOMMENDING A SUPPORT WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORED THE SPONSOR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS REGARDING DATA PRIVACY FOR TEACHERS. AND INCLUDING CHARTER SCHOOLS. THINK. SO COUNTY WAS A WITNESS IN SUPPORT NOW IS IN OPPOSITION. YEAH I WAS TO CARRY MEMBERS JOHN WHEN YOU'RE ON THE OTHER THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL SAYS HE ASIAN. RESPECTFULLY HERE IN OPPOSITION WITH THE. COMMITTEE AMENDMENT. WE BELIEVE TEACHER CREDENTIALING FLEXIBILITY AS A CORE TENET OF CHARTER SCHOOLS AND ALLOWS CHARTER SCHOOLS TO INNOVATE IN AREAS SUCH AS BLOCK SCHEDULING. INTEGRATED CURRICULUM AND BLENDED LEARNING. CONFINING CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS TO STATE DEFINED CLASSIFICATIONS INHIBITS THE VERY TENTATIVE CHARTER SCHOOLS. CURRENTLY CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO RETAIN ALL CREDENTIALS IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZED HER IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING COMPLAINTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AB THIRTY FORTY EIGHT INCLUDES A STATEWIDE DEFINITION OF CORE COURSES IN CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS BROAD APPLICATION IS PROBLEMATIC WITHIN THE UNIQUE. CHARTER SCHOOL STRUCTURE WITH WHICH RETAINS LOCAL FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN THE CHARTER SCHOOL AND IT'S AUTHORIZED OR IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE DESIGNATION OF SPECIFIC COURSES. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS MUST MAINTAIN AUTONOMY AND FLEXIBILITY. BETTER REMAIN SUCCESSFUL IN PRODUCING POSITIVE RESULTS TOWARD STUDENTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. AB THIRTY FORTY EIGHT WITH THE AMENDMENTS. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DOCTOR WHAT. WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT IN THIS IN THIS BILL WHAT DOWN? FOR MISS ASSIGNMENTS OF. WHAT HAPPENS? BUT WE ACTUALLY ARE. WITH THIS NEW PROCESS TRYING TO FOCUS MORE ON PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN PROVIDING SUPPORTS. TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THAT HOWEVER IF THE BILL DOES HAVE LANGUAGE IN IT THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ADOPT REGULATIONS. THAT WOULD CREATE A SET OF CONSEQUENCE BUT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO FOCUS MORE. I THINK IN. IN HARMONY WITH THE STATE'S OVERALL FOCUS ON TRYING TO SUPPORT AND TRYING TO. YOU KNOW IMPROVE SCHOOLS RATHER THAN SORT OF YOU KNOW HOLD OUT THE THREAT OF PUNISHMENT TO THEM SO THAT'S OR FOCUSING ON INITIALLY. WHAT DO YOU WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN TERMS OF OF WHAT HAS BEEN ASKED TO? RESPONSIVE SCHOOLS IT MAY NOT BE TRADITIONAL. THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT TRADITIONAL IN TERMS OF. CERTIFICATION IN TERMS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE HAVING CURRICULUM THAT GOES ACROSS SEVERAL DISCIPLINES IN THE APPLIED CURRICULUM IN ALL KINDS OF INNOVATIVE THINGS HOW ARE YOU RESPONDING TO THAT. IT BECAUSE IT MAY NOT FIT INTO THE. YOU KNOW THE THE CATEGORY THAT THIS PERSON IS TEACHING HISTORY I'VE BEEN TO SOME OF THOSE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE. YOU KNOW WITH THEIR HISTORY AND LITERATURE AND SCIENCE IS ALL BLENDED INTO ONE. BECAUSE HUGE O. KIND OF LOW CURRICULUM OF LOVE. THAT SO I THINK LONG BEACH DOES SOME OF THAT IN SOME OF THE PLACES HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. RIGHT ARE YOU SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS NO THIS THIS IS SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS I ATTENDED. THEY HAVE I'M BLACK AND I CAN THINK OF THE NAME OF THE TERM BUT YOU DO A LOT OF LONG BEACH. WOULD YOU CALL IT. WELL I MEAN I QUE AT SCHOOL SOMETIMES YOU'LL HAVE SOMEONE TEACHING HUMANITIES WHICH OFTEN HELLO I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE A HISTORY WAS ON SIGNS FOCUSES ON SOME ROCKETRY. BUT WHAT THE LITERATURE THE HISTORY AND THE MATH AND SCIENCE WAS ALL IN ONE. HUGE COULD KIND OF CURRICULUM DOUBLE DIDN'T THE AMERICAN IDENTIFIED AS IT'S BEEN UP THE MATTER THINGS YET BUT IT IT'S SOMETHING IT'S AN A IF TO SPELL PATENTS LIKE THIS PAST AUGUST SO. I'M I'M SORRY PLEASE NO NO GO AHEAD NOW I KNOW THAT YEAH IF YOU'RE CAUGHT UP THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS READY THERE'S OR. THIS REQUIREMENT IS ALREADY IN PLACE THIS IS JUST STREAMLINING THE REQUIREMENTS OF WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING. BEFORE AND WHAT WAS ACCEPT ACCEPTABLE FOR FLEXIBILITY IN CREDENTIALING IS STILL GOING TO BE DONE THIS IS JUST REALLY AUTOMATING. THAT PROCESS SO WOULD IT THEN HOW DOES THIS APPLY TO CHARTER SAYS WELL THAT'S THAT THE CHARTERS. WE INITIALLY HAD NOT A. APPLIED THIS BILL TO CHARTERS DISK THERE WAS A COMMITTEE AMENDMENT THAT INCLUDED THE CHARTER SO WE HAVE NOT WORKED WITH. ON THE FLEXIBILITY GET ON THE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY'RE CLAIMING THEY NEED THEY SAY. YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. EXACTLY WHAT IS. WHAT THEY DO WITH CREDENTIALING BEFORE WE CAN FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW TO INCLUDE THEM IN THIS YEAR I THINK? IT IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT SO. CURRENT AD CODE. REGARDING CHARTER SCHOOLS. SAYS THAT A. TEACHER TO CHARTER SCHOOL DIDN'T NEEDS TO HOLD A CERTIFICATE PERMIT OR OTHER DOCUMENT THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO THAT WHICH A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER WOULD HAVE. IF THEY ARE WORKING AND. IN CORE OR COLLEGE PREP COURSES. ARBIL ACTUALLY DOES NOT. AT ANY DEFINITION OF OF WHAT CORE SUBJECTS ARE BUT THERE ARE DEFINITIONS OF THAT ALREADY EXISTING IN STATE LAW. AWAY IF THEY'RE NOT IN A CORE. SUBJECT OR IF THEY'RE NOT IN A COLLEGE PREP COURSE THAN THEY DO YOU HAVE. A PRETTY WIDE DISCRETION ARE BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THAT THAT'S ALL EXISTING LAW. ALL THIS. THE ASSIGNMENT MONEY MONITORING PROCESS DOES IS. IT IT GIVES US A A MORE STREAMLINED WAY OF CHECKING UP ON WHETHER OR NOT SCHOOLS BOTH TRADITIONAL AND CHARTER. ARE. MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ALREADY CURRENTLY EXIST IN STATE. AND ADD TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE COMING UP WITH BLENDED COURSES OR TRY NEW AND INNOVATIVE THINGS. THE COMMISSION AS WELL AS A COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS. IN IN POSITIONS LIKE THAT. AND WE WE TRY TO HELP ADVISE THEM TO REMAIN WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF EXISTING EDUCATION CODE. WHILE ALSO. ALLOWING THEM TO BE INNOVATIVE AND AND COME UP WITH NEW WAYS TO DELIVER. TRADING STOOD. SO MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT. AS A AS SINCE THIS IS SOMETHING ADDED ON IT BEGIN THAT. THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IF YOU IF THEY HAVE TO BE CLIP INCLUDED IN THIS LIST? I ASSUME THAT THIS THIS THAT MUCH WORK STILL LEFT TO BE DONE AND NOT JUST. OFTENTIMES WE PUT IT ON SOMEBODY WITHOUT REALLY DOING THE WORK THE INTERNAL WORK AS YOU SAY YOU HADN'T GIVEN IT ANY THOUGHT UNTIL SOMEONE RECOMMENDED IT. ALL SO I ASSUME THAT THERE WILL BE SOME EFFORT TO. DISCUSS HOW THEY'RE TO BE INCORPORATED IN THIS WELL DIRT DOES LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND THE CHARTERS WERE NOT STAKEHOLDERS UNTIL VERY RECENTLY SO WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO. TO WORK WITH THEM AND AND AND. YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET INTO THE BILL. OKAY. ARE AYE I DON'T. HAVE TO DECIDE IF I'M GOING TO VOTE ON IT UNTIL IT'S DONE OKAY THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THE TEACHERS ARE SIGN CORRECTLY IS THAT TRUE. CRACKED OKAY AND THIS REALLY JUST MERELY SET UP AN AUTOMATED PROCESS. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA MUCH EASIER FASHION AND CHARTERS TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THEIR TEACHERS ARE SON CORRECTLY. SO I DON'T KNOW FROM THE CHARTER SIGN WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT AYE I FAIL TO SEE WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT. OTHER THEN YO'VE GOT SOME YOU DON'T TELL US I MEAN IT'S PRETTY I MEAN YOU DO HAVE MORE LEEWAY. AND THE TRADITIONAL IS ALREADY WE'RE NOT ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE THAT TODAY SO I'M I'M I'M STILL CONFUSED AND WHERE THIS ARGUMENT COMES THAT THEY DON'T WANT IT TO ARTISTS AND AUTOMATED PROCESS. KIND HELPS EVERYBODY IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT TEACHERS ARE SITE CORRECTLY. AND I THINK I SHOULD WRITE BECAUSE I WILL GO UP NOT WHERE WE HAVE NOT. WE ARE NOT CONSIDERING THEM STAKEHOLDERS YET BECAUSE I'M INITIALLY WILL BRING THEM INTO THE CONVERSATION SO YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THAT THANK YOU YEAH THE SKIN YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE JUMPING BACK THERE YOU WANT TO TALK SO GO FOR IT. WHISKEY AND WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES I MISSED THE IN A IN SUPPORT. OF LINE THINK YOU. OKAY. OKAY AND AGAIN YOU KNOW BE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS GOING ON DOWN THE ROAD. THANKS SO WITH THAT THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO GIVE THAT UP THERE A FEW TIMES CLOSE DECISION A CHANCE TO RESPOND. SHARES CONCERNS ARE AYE QUESTION I SHOULD SAY AYE AYES TO YOU KNOW WHY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS HE TRYING TO ACTUALLY CLOSES UP BECAUSE I THINK SHE'S COMMITTED TO WORK WITH THEM SO I DON'T. DEBATE ON IF I SAY SOMETHING YOU SAY YOU WANT TO IT IS JUST ABOUT OVER SO LET'S NOT SAY QUICKLY AND I TRUST THAT BRADLEY WILL BE. YOU DON'T LEASE I HAD. I THINK I THINK JUST FROM FROM A HIGH LEVEL PERSPECTIVE WE JUST HAVE A ISSUE WITH HAVING A STATEWIDE DEFINITION OF. OF COURSE IS THAT INTERFERES WITH THE LOCAL FLEXIBILITY WITH OUR AUTHORIZED USERS. WILL WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE AUTHOR BUT. FROM IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'VE NEVER BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS MONITORING SYSTEM BUT. SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS A SEAT SO THANK YOU THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANY DEFINITION OF ANY COURSE THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT. WE'VE STATED THAT FOR EMPHATICALLY TODAY SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CONCERNS COMING FROM BUT THAT WILL BE PART OF YOUR CONVERSATION. WITH THAT DO WE HAVE A MOTION. ALL MOVEMENT TO HAVE A SECOND IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. YOU THE MOTION IS SUPPORT AS AMENDED. PLEASE CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE THE. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS. I'M SORRY. DO PASS AS AMENDED DO PASS AS MEDICAL. TO APPROPRIATIONS. O'DONNELL AYE O'DONNELL AYE KILEY. KILEY NO KALRA. CALLER I MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE STEINORTH. THEY'RE MEANT. THURMOND AYE WEBER. LOCAL FOR NOW AND WE. OKAY WHETHER I. BOB. THERE'S FIVE DOES. THE US FIVE VOTES IT IS OUT NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO. MISTER CHOOSE COMES IRWIN IS GONE MISS WALDRON. ALMOST I'M SORRY MISS WALDRON. MR THURMAN I MADE A PREVIOUS ARRANGEMENT GO RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAYS HE'LL BE OFFICIAL AT THE TIME. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING APOLOGIES TO MISS WALDRON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I HAVE A WITNESS USE ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE HAS TO LEAVE UNFORTUNATELY BUT THANK YOU. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT THAT IS FILE ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY SOME FILE ITEM TWENTY SEVEN. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT SEEKS TO HELP US ADDRESS OUR TEACHER SHORTAGE. AYE IN THE STATE IS WELL DOCUMENTED MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE EXPERIENCING TEACHER SHORTAGE THERE MANY WAYS TO TO HELP ADDRESS THAT BUT ONE OF THE. ISSUES IT HAS BECOME A BARRIER IS A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR EDUCATORS A TO LIVE IN THE DISTRICTS WHERE THEY WORK UP THIS BILL SEEKS TO CREATE A WAY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF SO THAT THEY CAN REMAIN IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY WORK. HISTORICALLY OUR HOUSING PROGRAMS HAVE NOT A PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS THAT WILL GO UP AS HIGH AS A HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT A A MIND WHICH IS. THAT LEVEL WHERE WORK TEACHERS AND OTHERS IN OUR WORKFORCE ARE TYPICALLY. FALL IN THAT RANGE. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A NEW PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED FOR PRE DEVELOPMENT. AND DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING TO SUPPORT. AT OF THE BUILDING OF HOUSING FOR TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIEDS THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT IN MANY DISTRICTS INCLUDING RURAL DISTRICTS ARE RECRUITING AND RETAINING TEACHERS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE. I'M AWARE OF DISTRICTS THAT HAVE REPORTED. THAT FOUR YEARS RUNNING THEY HAVE TO REPLACE AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED OR MORE TEACHERS EVERY SINGLE YEAR WE KNOW THAT'S A THREAT TO CLOSING ARCHIE ME GAP OF SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS. AND SO WE THINK THIS IS A CREATIVE WAY. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS IS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION KARAMANA ROW. AND REPRESENTING WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED IS DOMINIC DUTRA FROM DCG STRATEGIES WHO WAS ASSISTING THAT DISTRICT WITH THEIR EFFORTS TO BUILD EMPLOYEE HOUSING I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU AYE VOTE. WHAT DOES? GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE BEFORE YOU AGAIN. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I AM SURE YOUR QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE. TEACHER SHORTAGE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS NOW. A WHAT WERE CERTAINLY FINING IN ALAMEDA COUNTY IS THAT. WE HAVE EMPLOYED STRATEGIES HONOR SUPPORTING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD SUPPORT STRATEGIES. TO ATTRACT TEACHERS TO THE PROFESSION TO. ACTUALLY INCREASE THE TEACHING FORCE IN THE FIELDS WHERE WE KNOW IT'S NEEDED MOST IN THE SCIENCES AND IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. ARE HOWEVER WITHOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED SO WE DO A GREAT JOB OF HAVING SOME TEACHERS COME TO PLACES LIKE OAKLAND ARE BERKELEY. AND THEN THEY FIND OUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST ACTUALLY LIVES THERE. OUGHT AND CANNOT SIGN THE CONTRACT. CHOOSE TO GO ELSEWHERE AND QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF THEM ARE DISILLUSIONED OF BY. THIS PROFESSION THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN TO GO INTO. THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO REMAINING IN IN A LOT OF CASES SO. I FOR ONE AM ARE QUITE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE PLACES FOR OUR. TEACHERS AND MORE BROADLY OUR WORKFORCE IN EDUCATION TO LIVE ARE THE ONLY COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN WORKING TO ACTUALLY USE SOME OF THE LAND THAT IT HOUSE FOR THIS PURPOSE. ON WE'RE LOOKING AT CREATIVE WAYS OF OF FUNDING SUCH A THING WE HAVE. OF THE LAND THAT WE COULD INVEST IN THIS AND REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO US SERVE OUR DISTRICTS BY PROVIDING MORE HOUSING FOR THEIR WORK FORCE I BELIEVE THIS IS A. CRITICAL ISSUE AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL. NOT DOMINICK DO TRY. OF FROM THE CITY OF FREMONT I JUST WANT A BRIEF I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAYS I WANT TO SPEAK BRIEFLY FROM A POLICY A PROFESSIONAL IN THE AND A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE. FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. MY FAMILY GOES BACK THIRTY YEARS MY DAD WAS IN THE TWENTIETH I REPRESENTED THE TWENTY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL IN THE CITY OF FREMONT. SO WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF SUPPORTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OPPORTUNITIES AND PROJECTS WITHIN THE REGION AND LEGISLATION JUST HAS SIMPLY NOT CAUGHT UP WITH WHAT WE NOW CALL THE MISSING MIDDLE THE V. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN AS NOTED. THE THE GAP FUNDING AND THE PRE DEVELOPMENT FUNDING IS SIMPLY NOT THERE LEGISLATIVELY TO ALLOW US TO EFFECTIVELY. BUILD THESE SORT OF PROJECTS I KNOW THAT FROM A PROFESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE TO THEIR FAMILY'S BEEN IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY. FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS I'VE STARTED TO FIRM IDC YOU STRATEGIES THAT FOCUSES SINCE I LEFT THE CITY COUNCIL EXCLUSIVELY ON WORK BY PUBLIC ENTITIES AND FAITH BATES ENTITIES. AYE USING STE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE PURPOSES FOR THE LAND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. NOW JUST CLOSE OF THE PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE AND THAT IS MY DAUGHTER. MY DAUGHTER IS A TEACHER SEES A SPECIAL ED TEACHER. AYE SHE IS NOT ONLY A GRADUATE OF CAL BERKELEY BUT AL WENT ON AND GOT HER MASTER'S DEGREE SHE'S A SPECIAL EDUCATION. TEACHERS IS IN HER THIRD YEAR HE DID FOUR YEARS NATIONAL SERVICE TWO YEARS WITH CITY YEAR IN TWO YEARS WITH TEACH FOR AMERICA. SHE NOW I DOES A FANTASTIC JOB BUT LIVES IN A FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT STUDIO IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND SPENDS FIFTY PERCENT EFFORT GROSS. WAGES SHE'LL BE MOVING HOME IN MAY. NOT THAT SHE'S THRILLED ABOUT THAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE TO HAVE BEEN THE EMPTY NESTERS ARE TOO THRILLED ABOUT THAT EITHER BUT. I SHE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE A BECAUSE OF THE DEBT THAT SHE IS TAKING ON. SO REALLY DID IT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION I'M SO THANKFUL FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMOND TAKING THIS UP. I REALLY DO BELIEVE IT WILL PROVIDE SOME OF THE GAP OF P. DEVELOPMENT FUND THAT WE NEED. TO MAKE THESE PROJECTS NOT ONLY VIABLE PUT POSSIBLE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING US TO COMMENT. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

AND THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN ARE SAFER AT SCHOOL. CURRENTLY THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I SEE ARE VULNERABLE. WHAT THE TIMES ARE WIDE OPEN GATES OR WIDE OPEN? AS A MOM THAT'S OF CONCERN TO ME AND THAT'S WHY A PARTICULAR THIS BILL. RECENT CHAT TRAGEDIES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES NECESSITATE THE NEED FOR SCHOOLS TO REASSESS THEIR FACILITIES AND SECURITY FOR PREVENTION OF THREATS. AND THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT A SAFETY PLAN BUT OF FULL SECURITY PHYSICAL AND OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT. THE BILL REQUIRES LOCAL SCHOOLS TO COLLABORATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR THREAT ASSESSMENT EVALUATION WHICH WOULD INCLUDE A FULL SECURITY ASSESSMENT OF THE CAMPUS PERIMETER. FENCING WALLS GATEWAYS PARKING LOTS LIGHTING SECURITY CAMERAS ENTRYWAY SECURITY SCHOOL BUILDING LAYOUTS DIAGRAMS. THINGS LIKE THAT VISIBILITY BLIND SPOTS OR. THEY HAVE THE WEAPONS DETECTION ABILITY OR ANY KIND OF FOAM. TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE. SMART STUDENT ID'S UTILIZATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED. OF COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL BETWEEN THE SCHOOL PUBLIC LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF THE EMERGENCY PLAN IF. THEY HAVE ONE IN AFFECT. THREAT ASSESSMENT FACILITY PROTOCOLS ENSURE THAT ALL SCHOOLS HAVE FEASIBLE PROTECTIONS. INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGIES AND STRATEGIES IN PLACE TO PREVENT THREATS THREATS THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS PREVENT THEM. UP FROM HAPPENING. AND AS WE KNOW WHEN SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN. IT'S IN A CRISIS. IT'S VITAL FOR SCHOOLS TO KNOW HOW TO REACT AND RESPOND TO EACH CRISIS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE FACILITY. AND THE TECHNOLOGIES THE MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN PLACE ON THE CAMPUS. WHICH WILL HELP THEM IN RESPONDING TO AN EMERGENCY INCIDENT. HIGHER CHEN AYE VOTE.

AB TWENTY SIX OH NINE MISTER O'DONNELL PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO INCREASE OUR SUPPLY OF CREDENTIALED STEM TEACHERS BY RECRUITING SCIENTISTS. WHO WANT TO BECOME K. TWELVE TEACHERS? CALIFORNIA IS THE MIDDLE OF A CHRONIC AND SEVERE SHORTAGE OF STEM TEACHERS WHICH MEANS THAT TOO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO HIGH QUALITY STEM EDUCATION BOTH IN HIGH SCHOOL AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AT THE SAME TIME MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS CAN'T FIND SECURE EMPLOYMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH FACULTY JOBS. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TEACH THIS BILL HELPS THEM MOVE INTO SECURE REWARDING CAREERS AS TEACHERS AND GIVES OUR STUDENTS DIRECT ACCESS. TO CALIFORNIA'S CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC TALENT. THIS BILL ALSO LAYS OUT A PLAN FOR SUPPORTING AND RETAINING THESE NEW TEACHERS AND RICARDO AS A REPORT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROGRAM WORKS. TO CONCLUDE WE NEED MULTIPLE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR SOLVING STE THE STEM TEACHER SHORTAGE THIS KID UP THIS BILL CAN BE A ALUABLE PART OF OUR TOOL KIT FOR TACKLING. THIS STATEWIDE ISSUE.

THE CALIFORNIA SCIENCE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION MISSION IS TO PROVIDE A HIGH QUALITY SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS IN ORDER FOR STUDENTS TO RECEIVE A HIGH QUALITY SCIENCE EDUCATION. THEY NEED TO HAVE WELL PREPARED WELL SUPPORTED AND HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE STATE BOARD ADOPTED THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS THEY ARE DESIGNED TO BE TAUGHT IN A WAY THAT EMBRACES A YOUNG PERSON'S INNATE CURIOSITY BY INTRODUCING SCIENCE. AND KINDERGARTEN TO ALL STUDENTS AND CONTINUING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AS STUDENTS PROGRESSED FROM GRACE TO GRADE THE STANDARDS BUILT. IN UNDERSTANDING OF AND COMPLEX A CONCEPTS OVER TIME. THE NEW STANDARDS ASK THAT STUDENTS THINK AND BEHAVE LIKE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS LIKE THE LOVELY TEACHER SITTING NEXT TO ME. BY ASKING QUESTIONS ENGAGING AND SENSEMAKING AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO EMPHASIZE. AND HANDS ON LEARNING AND DISCOVERY WHEN STUDENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SCIENCE AND ENGINEERS DO THEIR WORK AND HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO CARRY OUT INVESTIGATIONS AND DESIGN SOLUTIONS THEY BECOME MORE ENGAGED IN THE LEARNING AND THEIR COMPREHENSION INCREASES. AS ARTICULATED IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS OF THE BILL SCIENCE OR STEM TEACHER SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA'S REAL AB TWENTY SIX OR NINE WOULD LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS TO RECRUIT AND SUPPORT SCIENTISTS WHO WANT TO MOVE FROM HIGHER EDUCATION WHERE THERE'S A SURPLUS OF PEOPLE. WANTING AT COMPETING FOR JOBS TOWARDS A REWARDING CAREER IN TEACHING SCIENCE AND K. TWELVE MAKING THE TRANSITION FROM A POST SECONDARY CAREER TRACK TO TEACHING IN K.

ON AN ISSUE I'M SURE ALL OF US TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. THIS BIPARTISAN BILL REQUIRE GREAT. CRATES SEVEN EIGHT NINTH TENTH ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH. PUBLIC SCHOOLS CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO INCLUDE THE NATIONAL CRISIS TEXT LINE AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LINE LINE. ONE STUDENT IDENTIFICATION CARDS. HIGH SCHOOL PREPARE STUDENTS FOR ADULTHOOD COLLEGE AND THE WORK FORCE UNFORTUNATELY THERE MORE SOCIAL PRESSURES THAT ARE PLACED ON YOUNG ADULTS THAN EVER BEFORE THE STATUS. WITH THE PREVALENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA APPS SUCH SNAPCHAT. IN INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK TEAMS ARE FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE FROM BOWLING. ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY BY SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY BETWEEN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN THE NUMBER OF TEENS WHO FELT USELESS JOYLESS. WHICH ARE TYPICAL SIGNS OF DEPRESSION ROSE THIRTY THREE PERCENT IN NATIONAL SURVEYS. THE NUMBER OF THIRTEEN TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE. INCREASED THIRTY ONE PERCENT. THIS RISE IN DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE CORRELATES WITH THE GROWING USE OF SMART PHONES AS WELL SOCIAL MEDIA. AS THE USAGE OF SMARTPHONES IS INCREASED WE SHOULD PROVIDE EMOTIONAL HELP TO TEENS FOR THEM TO USE. WITH THESE DEVICES. WHETHER STUDENTS WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE OR TEXAS SOMEONE THERE ARE EFFECTIVE RESOURCE THE MITIGATE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND HELP THEM HANDLE THE PRESSURES OF MY SCHOOL. THE NATIONWIDE CRISIS TEXT LINE IS A FREE CONFIDENTIAL TWENTY FOUR HOUR SUPPORT SERVICE THAT STUDENTS CAN CONTACT ANY TIME VIA TEXT. SINCE GOING LIVE AUGUST TWENTY THIRTEEN NEARLY THIRTY SEVEN MILLION MESSAGES HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED BETWEEN THE CRISIS COUNSELORS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN NEED. FOURTEENTH WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO SOMEONE OVER THE PHONE THERE'S OF COURSE THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE. THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE PROVIDES FREE AND CONFIDENTIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT.

AND HASN'T BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF DEATH FOR THAT AGE GROUP FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW. TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTED FOR NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT ALMOST TEN PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE NATION SUICIDES. RESULTING IN THE US LOSING SOMEONE EVERY TWO HOURS OF EVERY DAY. WE NO THAT UPWARDS OF NINETY PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ULTIMATELY DIED BY SUICIDE. WERE LIVING WITH A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION AT THE TIME OF THEIR DEATH BUT OFTEN THESE CONDITIONS WHEN UNDIAGNOSED UNTREATED. TO PREVENT SUICIDE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE AND CRISIS HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES. AND THAT THEY TAKE ACTION TO SAVE THEIR LIVES THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE IT'S A NATIONAL NETWORK OF OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACCREDITED CRISIS CENTER HOTLINES. THE CRISIS TEXT LINE IS FREE. PROVIDES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SUPPORT FOR THOSE IN CRISIS ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO TAX FROM ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT TAX TO A TRAINED CRISIS COUNSELOR. BY OFFERING IMMEDIATE COUNSELING TO EVERYONE THAT MAY NEED IT.

AS AMENDED TO AB TWO ZERO ONE FIVE WILL REQUIRE THAT SCHOOLS OFFER INFORMATION TO STUDENTS ON HOW TO PROPERLY COMPLETE AND SUBMIT THE FREE APPLICATION. FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID OR THE FAB SO. AND THE CALTRAIN DREAM ACT APPLICATION. THIS WILL HAPPEN AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE GRADE TWELVE AND AS AMENDED. THIS BILL PROVIDES SCHOOLS WITH THE NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE HOW THEY WILL PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE. THE TRANSITION FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE IS CRUCIAL TO A STUDENT'S EDUCATIONAL CAREER. RESEARCH FROM THE NATIONAL COLLEGE ACCESS NETWORK. STATES THAT NINETY PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS WHO COMPLETE THE PHELPS ATTEND COLLEGE AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL COMPARED TO JUST FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. OF FRAPH SO NON COMPLETAS. RECEIVING ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO FILL OUT THE FLAPS AND DREAM ACT APPLICATIONS CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER A STUDENT WILL OR WILL NOT ATTEND COLLEGE. SO WE MUST ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS DAVID O'BRIEN DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. YOU.

MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM CONVINCED THAT THE COMING YEARS WILL SEE AN INFLECTION POINT WHERE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WILL FUEL. OUT EXPLOSION IN HUMAN PRODUCTIVITY IN DEVELOPMENT GREATER THAN ANYTHING THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN AND WE'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SEE THIS IN FACT CAREERS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RELATED FIELDS. HEAVY JOB GROWTH OF OVER NINETEEN PERCENT WHEREAS CAREERS IN OTHER FIELDS ARE STAGNANT. I HOWEVER I AM CONVINCED ALSO THAT WE HAVE A GROWING PROBLEM WHERE WE'RE FAILING TO PROPERLY PREPARE. OUR CHILDREN FOR CAREERS IN THESE FIELDS AND. CAN FACTOR BEEN ONE NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT DOES DON THAT SEE. THAT SHOW THAT WE ARE UNDER PREPARING STUDENTS AND SO THE SO CALLED STEM FIELD SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS. THIS BILL AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE. IS ONE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM IT CREATES A NEW DIPLOMACY ALL THE SEAL OF STEM FOR CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS THAT RECOGNIZE PREPARATION IN THESE FIELDS TO QUALIFY THE SEAL AS FOR THE SEAL. AS OUR. AS PROPOSED YOU WOULD NEED FOR YEARS OF MATHEMATICS ONE YEAR OF WHICH COULD BE COMPUTER SCIENCE YOU NEED FOUR YEARS OF A HARD SCIENCE SUCH AS BIOLOGY. OR PHYSICS OR CHEMISTRY THAT YOU WOULD YOU DO ACHIEVE A MINIMUM GPA OF THREE PA THREE POINT OH IN THOSE. IN THOSE CLASSES. I THINK THAT IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE THAT WE MOTIVATE STUDENTS TO CHOOSE CLASS WORK IN THESE FIELDS AND WE ALSO MOVING SCHOOLS TO EMPHASIZE ENROLLMENT IN THESE CLASSES AND.

THURMOND AYE WEBER. WEBER AYE. THAT. THE BILL IS OUT WE'RE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM THIRTY FOUR AB THREE TWO ZERO FIVE MISTER O'DONNELL YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER THAT HAS PARTICIPATED IN MANY SCHOOL LOCKDOWNS. SOME LASTING AS LONG AS SIX HOURS I CAN ATTEST TO THE NEED FOR A TEACHER TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOCK A CLASSROOM DOOR FROM INSIDE THE CLASSROOM. IMAGINE THIS BILL GOES OFFER YOU MADE TO YOUR MADE AWARE THAT YOU NEED TO IMMEDIATELY LOCK THE CLASSROOM DOOR TO ENSURE STUDENT SAFETY. THIS MEANS YOU HAVE TO GET OUT YOUR KEYS WALK OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM AND LOCK THE DOOR. THIS TAKES TIME AND MAY REQUIRE REQUIRE TEACHER TO STEP OUT INTO A VERY SAFE ENVIRONMENT. YOU MAY HAVE YOUR KEYS IN YOUR POCKET. pIN YOUR POCKET YOU TO LOCATE THEM OFTEN I WOULD KEEP THEM OFTENTIMES I WOULD KEEP THE MY DESK THAT MEANS I MIGHT NOT BE. YOU KNOW YOU CAN NEAR MY DESK I WOULD HAVE TO WALK OVER TO MY DESK LOCATE MY KEYS. GO THROUGH MY KEYS WALKED TO THE DOOR STEP OUTSIDE. INTO WHAT MIGHT BE A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION. FOLLOWING THE COLUMBINE COLORADO SHOOTING IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHERE THIRTEEN STUDENTS AND A TEACHER WERE KILLED. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL THAT REQUIRES ALL NEW SCHOOLS TO HAVE LOCKS. THAT LOCK FROM INSIDE THE CLASSROOM. THE MAJORITY OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD THIS MEANS THAT IS LIKELY THAT MOS OF OUR CLASSROOM DOORS. DO NOT LOCK FROM THE INSIDE. IN TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY TWO TWENTY SIX STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS WERE KILLED AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN CONNECTICUT. A NUMBER OF THEM WERE SHOT AND CLASSROOMS THAT COULD ONLY BE LOCKED FROM THE OUT SIDE. ONE OF THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS OF A COMMISSION FORMED AFTER THE INCIDENT WAS CHANGE THE LOCKS ALLOW A TEACHER TO LOCK THE CLASSROOM DOOR FROM INSIDE THE CLASSROOM. THE RECENT TRAGEDY AND MARJORIE STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN PARKLAND FLORIDA REMINDS US THAT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE CALIFORNIA MUST ACT. THIS BILL REQUIRES MODERNIZATION PROJECTS SEEKING STATE BOND FUNDS TO INCLUDE IN THOSE PROJECTS LOCKS ON CLASSROOM DOORS THAT CAN BE LOCKED. FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. AS A TEACHER AND A PARENT I TAKE STUDENTS SECURITY VERY SERIOUSLY. LET'S ENSURE THAT STUDENTS TEACHERS AND ALL SCHOOL STAFF ARE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. WHETHER THEY ARE IN A NEW SCHOOL. OR AN OLDER SCHOOL. I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE. TO WITNESS IS HERE WITH ME TODAY MISTER CHAIR. IF THEY MAY PERCEIVE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS OF THE COMMITTEE RON RAPIDLY HAVE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS I ACTUALLY LIVED FIVE MILES FROM COLUMBINE WHEN THAT WENT DOWN BOTH OF MY. GUTTERS WERE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND IT WAS A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE. SO YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WE'VE SPONSORED A SIMILAR BILL MANY MANY TIMES AND AND YET IT WAS KILLED BECAUSE OF COST. HOW CAN WE PUT A COST ON A CHILD TO LIVE THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE SOLUTION BELIEVE IT OR NOT? YOU HAVE TO WALK OUTSIDE YOUR CLASSROOM AND MANY SCHOOLS TO LOCK YOUR DOOR IMAGINE IF A SHOOTER. COMES INTO THE BUILDING AND AND. YOU'RE TO WALK OUTSIDE SO WE'RE PUTTING OUR OUR TEACHERS AND OUR STUDENTS LIVES IN DANGER. WE NEED TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS WE THINK THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE STRATEGY AND. AND. CERTAINLY. ONE THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO. PROVIDE FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR OUR. STUDENTS AND FOR OUR TEACHERS NOW'S THE TIME TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS THIS IS A SIMPLE STRATEGY AND LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS.

O'DONNELL AYE O'DONNELL I KILEY AYE KILEY AYE KALRA KALRA AYE MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE STEINORTH. STEINORTH AYE THURMAN. WEBER. WEBER I. THE BILL IS OUT TO CUNNINGHAM. IS FILE ITEM EIGHTEEN AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY MISTER CUNNINGHAM PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU SIR I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY UNDER CURRENT LAW THE STATE. IS CHARGED WITH PROVIDING ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION RELATED DISPUTES THAT CANNOT BE RESOLVED. THESE HEARINGS ARE CONDUCTED BY THE MINISTRY OF LAW JUDGES. UNDER CURRENT LAW OR UNDER CURRENT LAW EITHER PARTY MAY REQUEST A CONTINUANCE OF THE HEARING. WHICH THE STATUTE SPECIFIES SHALL BE GRANTED UPON SHOWING OF QUOTE UNQUOTE GOOD BECAUSE. HOWEVER UNLIKE OTHER AREAS OF LAW THE STATUTE DOES NOT DEFINE WHAT GOOD CAUSE IS. SO WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE THE HEARINGS ARE SET AT A TIME PERIOD WHERE THE SCHOOL. IS OUT OF SESSION FOR SUMMER FOR WINTER. SPRING AND YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING WITNESSES THAT HER. EMPLOYEES OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ATTEND THE HEARING. THIS. PROLONGS DISPUTES AND MAKE SETTLEMENT DIFFICULT. AND IT DRIES UP COST FOR BOTH SIDES AND ACTUALLY IN SOME CASES CAN HAMPER OUR KIDS FROM GETTING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES IN A TIMELY WAY. IT'S THIS BILL WOULD DO TWO THINGS THAT WOULD CLARIFY IN STATUTE THE STANDARD FOR GOOD CAUSE. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION HEARING. IT IT WOULD CLARIFY THE STANDARD FOR BECAUSE IT WAS SPECIFIED THAT. THEY'RE TWO GROUNDS ACCOUNTS TO GOOD CAUSE FOR A ONE TIME CONTINUATION HEARING. THE FIRST ONE IS WHEN A MATERIAL WITNESS IS ABSENT. DO TO THE HEARING DATE BEING SAT ON A DAY WHEN THE SCHOOL WAS NOT IN SESSION. AND THE OTHER IS WHERE BOTH PARTIES BOTH PARTIES STIPULATE THAT EXTENSIONS NECESSARY TO RESOLVE THE MATTER. BY SETTLEMENT. A SOMETIME SCHOOL BOARDS CANNOT A ENACT A SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MEETING OVERWINTERED THEY CAN'T. VOTE ON IT AND SO YOU'VE GOT HEARING DATES THAT ARE DRIVING UP LITIGATION COSTS REALLY FOR NO. FOR NO REASON. I THINK IT'S COMMONSENSE IMPROVEMENT IN THE LAW. AGAIN IS JUST A ONE TIME CONTINUOUS FOR ONE OF THESE TWO GROUNDS. I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR TEACHERS GOOD FOR SCHOOL STAFF AND GOOD FOR KIDS AND HASTEN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. THANK YOU. ANYONE DOESN'T SUPPORT. KRISTY'S MOTHER BRIDGETTE READ EDUCATE ADVOCATE EMPOWER FAMILY CALIFORNIANS PART THANK YOU. EVELYN ABA HASN'T DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SUPPORTIVE AMENDED POSITION WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EQUALIZATION IN THE PROCESS OF THAT.

STORE NOT STEINORTH AYE THURMAN. WEBER. WEBER I. THE BILL IS OUT. AND I SEE MISTER LAZAR IN HERE. YOU'D LIKE TO APPROACH. THIS IS FILE ITEM FIFTEEN. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY. SEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PRESENTING. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY. THIS EVENING. OTHER CLEAN AND HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY REQUIRES ALL K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS WITH FIFTY OR MORE STUDENTS TO SWITCH TO SAFER. ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE CLEANING PRODUCTS ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE CLEANING PRODUCTS ARE THOSE THAT ARE INDEPENDENTLY CERTIFIED BY A THIRD PARTY. AS HAVING GREATLY REDUCE THE FACTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLISHED A REPORT URGING SCHOOLS TO SWITCH TO ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE. CLEANING PRODUCTS THE DEPARTMENT ALSO WARNED THAT CONVENTIONAL CLEANING PRODUCTS MAY CONTAIN CHEMICALS ASSOCIATED WITH ASTHMA CANCER REPRODUCTIVE HARM AND AND. CAN INDOCTRINATE OF DESTRUCTION. WHILE MORE AND MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE SWITCHED TO LESS TOXIC ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE CLEANING PRODUCTS CONVENTIONAL CLEANING PRODUCTS ARE STILL WIDELY USED. THE REQUIREMENT TO SWITCH TO ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE CHEMICALS IS ONLY REQUIRED IF IT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE TO THE SCHOOL MEANING. IF SWITCHING WILL HAVE NO NET COST INCREASE. IN REALITY ALMOST EVERY INSTITUTION ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY SWITCHING TO ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE CLEANING PRODUCTS. IF SCHOOLS OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHOOSE NOT TO COMPLY WITH THESE PROVISIONS THAN A LETTER DETAILING THE REASONS WHY COMPLIANCE IS NOT FEASIBLE SHALL BE POSTED. ON THE SCHOOLS OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WEBSITE. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY WILL REQUIRE SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO AVOID CLEANING PRODUCTS. THAT ARE HARMFUL TO TEACHERS STUDENTS AND CUSTODIAL STAFF. WHO HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EXPOSURE BY REQUIRING SCHOOLS TO SWITCH TO ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE CLEANING PRODUCTS IF ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE? WITH ME I HAVE BILL ELIUD WITH THE. SPONSOR ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AS WELL AS TONY TRICK ARROW. WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M BILL ALEJO ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND HAPPY TO SPONSOR THE BILL. MISTER NAZARIAN SAID MOST OF WHAT I NEED TO SAY SOLVE BE BRIEF. THE THIRD PARTY CERTIFIER IS THAT WOULD APPROVAL LISTA PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS EXCEPT FOR U. S. EPA SAFER CHOICE. PROGRAM WHICH IS NEWER AND DOING THE SAME THING AND THEY PROVIDE A LIST OF. DOZENS AND DOZENS OF CLEANING PRODUCTS IS NOT CREATING MONOPOLY WHICH JUST THOSE A MANUFACTURER TO WHO COULD HAVE THAT APPROVED. WE'VE. TAKE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION. I'M AND I THINK WE'RE CLOSE WITH THAT. A COUPLE OTHER ISSUES HAVE COME UP IN THE LAST WEEK. WHY NOT LET A STATE BODY CERTIFY THESE THINGS OF THE THIRD PARTY WITH A THIRD PARTY PEOPLE BEEN DOING IT FOR THIRTY YEARS OF DOING A GOOD JOB MANUFACTURERS SCHOOL DISTRICTS? OUR OWN DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES USES THEM. AND DO WE WANT TO PAY FOR A NEW STATE AGENTS I NEW PRODUCTS A PROGRAM A STATE AGENCY TO WOULD HAVE TO BE FEE BASED. OR COME OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND I DON'T THINK SO WE HAVE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE NOW. THIS THERE'S ALSO AN ACCUSATION SORT OF FIRES ALLOW TOXICS LIKE PROPS SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS TO BE CERTIFIED NOT TRUE I'VE LOOKED AT THEIR STANDARDS. THEY ALLOW NO INTENTIONALLY ADDED. MUTAGENS CARCINOGENS OR A CONTAINING THOSE INGREDIENTS IF THERE IS A TINY MOUSE ONE TARA HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION OR LESS. LASTLY SOMEONE SUGGEST WHY WE JUST THIS WOULD PROHIBIT THE USE OF DO IT YOURSELF PRODUCTS LIKE VINEGAR AND BAKING SODA. A THOSE ARE NOT ALWAYS BENIGN VINEGAR IS ALSO AN* MEGYN AND BE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LAW THAT WOULD SAY A TEACHER CAN'T CLEANER DESK WITH BAKING SODA VINEGAR IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. BUT MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE FEEL ONE USE REGULAR KEENING CLEANING PRODUCTS AND NOT START RESORTING TO BAKING SODA AND VINEGAR THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR TONY TO CARE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS WHERE IT'S SIMPLY WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY. UMP THIS. ISSUE IMPACTS EVERYONE AT THE SCHOOL SITE NOT JUST STUDENTS AND TEACHERS BUT ALL THE EMPLOYEES THERE I THINK THE ANALYSIS. ON PAGE BY POINTS OUT DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THIS IT'S A SOUND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MR MEMBERS ALICE FELONIES FELONIES GROUP ON BEHALF OF VOICE FOR CHOICE ADVOCACY IN SUPPORT. CAMERAS MURDEROUS SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION WE REPRESENT COST BY MEMBERS ON THE MOST POPULOUS DISTRICTS INCLUDING JANITORS AT WORK WITH THESE PRODUCTS NAM BEHALF BY MEMBERS THE STUDENTS WE SUPPORT. CHRISTIE'S MOTHERBOARDS ON BEHALF OF EDUCATE ADVOCATE AND EMPOWER FAMILY CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. WENDY CUTIE PARENT OF A CHILD WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL GOOD EVENING A COOKING UNITARILY HALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO STARTBY SAYING WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S AMENDMENTS THAT EXEMPTED. REAL PRODUCTS FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL OTHERS CLEANING PRODUCTS ARE CENTRAL IN OUR OPINION FOR REDUCING BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION ON FOOD SERVICE SAYS PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF FLU OUTBREAKS CLEANING RESTAURANT AT ULTRA. AND THEY ALREADY GO THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW BY THE US EPA AND DP ARE BEFORE REGISTRATION. WE ALSO AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE AUTHORED SPONSORS TO BELIEVE THAT USEPA SEE FOR CHOI CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WOULD QUALIFY UNDER THIRD PRE CERTIFIER. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE U. S. EPA HOWEVER JUST TO CONFIRM NOT. AND. MAY LOOK TO YOU. MAKE SOME CHANGES TO MAKE THAT EVEN CLEARER IF NECESSARY BUT WE DO SUPPORT THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT IS. BUT IT QUALIFIES. I'M WE JUST ALSO I WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT THAT. WHILE WE SUPPORT THAT THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION WE WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO LOOK AT OTHER SYSTEMS. AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO IMPROVE THEIR SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A. AND ORGANIZATIONS SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING LEADERSHIP COUNCIL AND THEY HAVE A PROCESS BASED APPROACH THAT HELPS. ORGANIZATIONS IDENTIFY THE SUSTAINABILITY GOALS THAT THEY HAVE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO REDUCE. ALLERGENS AND PRODUCTS. THEY CAN WAY AMONGST THE GREEN SALES WHICH HAVE BETTER. REDUCTIONS AND ALLERGENS. VERSUS WHAT MIGHT HAVE MORE ENVIRONMENTAL. BENEFIT SO. WE JUST THINK THIS ALLOWS THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ACHIEVE THEIR OWN GOALS. SO FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHER STATE IN OUR LETTER THAT I WON'T GO INTO WE ARE OPPOSED TODAY THINK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS TIM JUSTIN WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL OUT JUST TWO QUICK POINTS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEEK SOME CLARIFICATION ON THE LANGUAGE AROUND DISINFECTANTS AND SANITIZERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PRODUCTS. ARE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL THREATS FROM PATHOGENS NOROVIRUS WHAT HAVE YOU. AND THEN SECONDLY AS IT RELATES TO THE CRITERIA FOR A THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION WE DO HAVE SOME SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY OUR LEGAL FOLKS WE SHARE THOSE WITH MISTER HIS AREA AND. A LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THEM AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SIMILAR OPPOSITION WARRIOR BACK. STUDENTS ARE MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER MY QUESTION MAYBE YOU CAN STEP YOUR ARM WHEN YOU AWARENESS ABOUT OF THE SAFER CHOICE PROGRAM OF PUBLIC SHE DID. COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE ON WHAT MY CONCERNS HERE IS THAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO PICK WINNERS AND ON THE BUSINESS SIDE AND I DON'T THINK THAT YOUR INTENT HERE TODAY IS NO I'M SAYING AS MUCH SOME. I'M WORRIED THAT SOMEONE STARTS A LABEL SAYS LOOK YOU GET CERTIFIED BY US. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE GOLD pENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY NOW I'M GONNA MAKE MUCH MONEY NUMBER SIX. NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE BUT THAT'S MY CONCERN SO MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT MAYBE ONE OF THE. OTHER THE OTHER WITNESS COULD TALK ABOUT THE SAFER CHOICE PROGRAM. CHESTER. I'M SURE SO THE SAFER CHOICE PROGRAM IS RUN BY THE. U. S. EPA EYES SO WE DEFINITELY IT'S ANA OBVIOUSLY A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION SO WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY ARE A A PROGRAM THAT'S CONSIDERED DATE CERTIFIED. OVER TWO THOUSAND. PRODUCTS IN TERMS OF. THEIR COMPLIANCE. BUT FOR OF MANY OF THE THE REASONS YOU. MENTIONED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THAT'S WHY WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO LOOK AT THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY CERTIFICATION BASED. BUT MORE. HOLISTIC AND PROCESS BASED. IF I MAY COMMENT BILL ALLEY WITH THE WG. FOR MANY YEARS THAT WAS ON THE GREEN SEALING EAGLE LOGO AND NOW IT'S YOU EPSA PER CHOICES MUCH MORE ROBUST THAN JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THAT'S WHY WE THINK THE CRITERIA. AS EXPANDED WOULD ALLOW THE MEN WERE OKAY WITH THAT THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS RICHEST THAT THEY'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB TO EXTREMISTS WITHOUT THESE PROGRAMS WITHOUT CERTIFICATION THEY'RE MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT IT'S KIND OF THE WILD WEST OF A WOMAN NINE WELL APPARENT IN A WOODEN SCHOOL DISTRICT. WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT CHEMICALS AND THEY JUST TOLD HER THEY'RE ALL LEGAL LEAVE THE SALON THESE ARE LEGAL CLEANING PRODUCTS SO YOU HAVE TO. DISTRICTS WILL KIND OF FUN THERE KNOWS THAT THESE CONCERNS ESPECIALLY THE JANITORIAL STAFF TO GET THE MOST EXPOSURE I'VE SEEN PERSONALLY HOW WORKS IN ELK GROVE SCHOOL DISTRICT DOWN THE ROAD.

WITNESSES FROM FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA AND THE ADVANCEMENT PROJECT. MAYBE YOUR WITNESSES BUT. OF GOOD EVENING UMMC THE JOHN JOB IT WITH THE BEST PRICE IT FASTER PODCAST FORTY OUT. HERE TODAY NOT JUST AS AN ADVOCATE BUT A MOTHER OF A FOUR YEAR OLD WHO IS ATTENDING A PRETTY PROGRAM. I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT ABOUT THE RESURGENT BENEFITS OF EARLY EDUCATION. YOU'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE AND THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF LAYING THAT OUT. I WILL COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE AS A MOTHER. WHO HAD WHO WHOSE SON IS DRIVING BECAUSE HE'S IN A QUALITY PRE CARE PROGRAM? I THINK MY SIDE IS BRILLIANT AND I MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIASED. BUT HE'S BRILLIANT AND LEARNING BECAUSE HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. AT THE AGE OF FOUR YOU CAN DO ADDITION SUBTRACTION HE CAN WRITE A WHOLE SENTENCE HIS COMPASSIONATE CRITICALLY THINKS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IF HE HAS SAID OR DONE SOMETHING TO HURT HIS PEERS. I CAN TEACH HIM THAT HIS TEACHERS DEBT. IT'S ATTRACTIONS IN HIS SCHOOL TAUGHT HIM TO CONTROL HIS SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS. TO SHARE. IMAGINE FORTY THREE THOUSAND TO EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND KIDS. PRIVATELY SUCH OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR STATE. PRIVATE OF SUCH KNOWLEDGE. DEPRIVED OF BECOMING PERHAPS BRILLIANT. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL AN OPPORTUNITY GAP. WHEN THESE KIDS STEP INTO A KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM. WE'RE THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE HAD THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN THEIR KIDS HER LEARNING TO STILL SIT STILL. PAY ATTENTION PERHAPS EVEN LEARN TO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AS THEIR PEERS AND TEACHERS. THIS MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. IS WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY GAP BECOMES AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND IT PROCESS THROUGHOUT THEIR EDUCATIONAL CAREER. I'M LUCKY THAT I DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR MY CHILD. AND. PUTTING MY CHILDREN ON INTO A QUALITY EARLY LEARNING SETTING BUT MANY PARENTS HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. REALITY IS THAT PARENTS CAN AFFORD TO DO SO BILL PROPRIETOR BET PROVIDE THE BEST EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. MANY PARENTS CAN'T DO THAT. AND THIS IS WHERE THE STATE NEEDS TO COMMENT. IT IS THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY O MAKE THINGS EQUITABLE AND MITIGATE THESE GAPS EARLIER ON. IT DOESN'T PROJECT IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ANY FULLY SUMMARIZED YES ALMOST UNHEARD. OF PRE K. FOR ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNTIL THEN WE NEED TO PROVIDE THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A GOING CONCERN TO YOU. NEXT BUT.

AS WE ALL KNOW THERE'S OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE AND. AND DECADES OF RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT INVESTING IN HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS CAN LEAD TO PROMOTING BRAIN DEVELOPMENT PREVENTING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND PREVENTING LONG TERM EFFECTS LIKE POVERTY. SIMPLY PUT AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY FOUR WOULD CODIFY CALIFORNIA'S PRESCHOOL PROMISE AND ENSURE THAT ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS REGARDLESS OF THAT ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS WHO ARE INCOME ELIGIBLE WOULD RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY SUBSIDIZED CARE. ENCLOSING ABLE TO SHARE THAT THERE ARE A FEW BROADER ISSUES THAT WE KNOW ARMS ARE ARE. OUR BARRIERS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVING THE PRESCHOOL PROMISED THAT PROMISE THAT SIMPLY BAR TOO FAR TOO MANY CHILDREN FROM ACCESSING CARE THE TWO CRITICAL PIECES THAT WOULD JUST LIKE TO SHARE ONE THE LACK OF FACILITIES SUPPORT. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY IS LEADERSHIP AROUND EXPANDING QUALITY PRESCHOOL AND WE SEE AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY FOUR AS THE CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN ENSURING THAT ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS DO YOU HAVE HAVE ACCESS TO THESE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS.

I'M UNDER THE CURRENT EXISTING EAST THIS FRAMEWORK AS INDUSTRY LEADERS WE URGE THE STATE TO INVESTING EFFORTS TO EQUALIZE ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE ENCODING COURSES STARTING WITH THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS IN THE STATE. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION AND TECHNOLOGY JOBS INNOVATION AN AVERAGE WAGE ACCORDING TO KANT TIAS TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIVER STATES REPORT. IT QUANTIFIES THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE TECH INDUSTRY IN THE TOP WORKFORCE. ACROSS MULTIPLE VECTORS EMPLOYMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY EXPANDED BY AN ESTIMATED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND JOBS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND CONTRIBUTED MORE TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY. ACCORDING TO THE U. S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS IT IS PREDICTED THAT BY YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION JOBS WILL BE IN COMPUTING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS MORE THAN ALL OTHER SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY. ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS THE COMBINED HOWEVER IT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS GRADUATING WITH A COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE IS MINUSCULE COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE TECH JOBS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL. THERE REMAINS A LARGE DISPARITY BETWEEN STUDENTS FROM AFFLUENT SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME SCHOOLS WITH ACCESS TO QUOTING COURSE THAT. THE CALIFORNIA AFTER SCHOOL COMPUTER CODING GRANT PALETTE PROGRAM PROVIDES CRITICALLY NEEDED EXPOSURE AND ACCESS. THE CODING FOR AFTER SCHOOL YOUTH WHO ARE LESS LIKELY TO LEARN.

ADEQUATE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT RELATE TO OUR EL CAPS AND. BASICALLY. COMMUNITY DIALOGUE RELATE TO SCHOOL CONDITIONS AND CLIMATE THAT WE ALL KNOW THE AFTER FOUR YEARS OF LCF THAT IT'S A START BUT THERE'S NOT. AND NOT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL. IS THAT GUIDED TO DO AYE WITH ME TODAY. ARE. I CALIFORNIANS FOR JUSTICE AND THAT MR ROBERT GREEN ELEVENTH GRADER IT FROM HE WORDS UNIFIED SCHOOL MOUNT HAYDN HIGH SCHOOL. YOU'RE GOOD TO GO OF THINK.

NOW I AM GOING TO BE THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TO SAY IT IS TIME FOR THE STATE TO POOR AYE STUDENTS FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. AND SCHOOL CRIME IN IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE INVEST IN OTHER STATE PRIORITIES. STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ARE EXPERTS IN OUR EDUCATION AND NO ONE HAS MORE AT STAKE IN OUR SCHOOLS THEN. WE DO. I NEVER BELIEVED THAT I WOULD EVER GO TO A COLLEGE BECAUSE NONE OF MY FAMILY HAVE DONE BEFORE. I ASSUMED IT WASN'T FROM ME. BUT IN MY SOPHOMORE YEAR AND METAL LEVIN TEACHER MISS EASTWARD. SHE WAS SO SUPPORTIVE AND AMAZING. SHE CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT COLLEGE AND GIVE ME RESOURCES LIKE TUTORING. POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH TEACHERS AND STAFF IS CRITICAL FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. SLIGHTLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF COLOR. HOWEVER SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS SHOW THAT ONE OUT OF THREE STUDENTS CAN IDENTIFY A SINGLE CARING WIDOWED AT SCHOOL.% THIS SCHOOL CLIMATE DATA IS WHAT MY FELLOW STUDENTS AND HAVE SHARED. WITH MY DISTRICT TO PUSH THEM TO CHANGE THIS REALITY IN. AND GUESS WHAT. THEY ARE LISTENING AND PARTNERING. WITH US TO FIND SOLUTIONS. THEY ARE LISTENING BECAUSE THROUGH OAKLAND'S EL CAP PARENT STUDENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD TRUSTING COLLABORATIVE. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH DISTRICT STAFF ARE SUPER.

FIRST OFF THANK YOU TO THE AG COMMITTEE STAFF UP FOR THE FEEDBACK ON OUR BILL. CALIFORNIANS FOR JUSTICE PUBLIC ADVOCATES AND THE DEPARTMENT HAVE SHARED AMENDMENTS ON MONDAY THAT ADDRESS STAFF'S CONCERNS. WE'RE AT A MAJOR CROSSROADS WITH ALTHEA BENEFITS A HOOF YOU KNOW WELL AND WE FIND THE BIGGEST THREAT. TO THE SUCCESS OF LC FF THE BIGGEST THREAT EQUITY IN LC FF IS ACTUALLY THE LACK OF CAPACITY FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND SCHOOL CLAIMING. RESEARCH AND OUR EXPERIENCE IN THIRTY DISTRICT SHOWS THE REQUIREMENT TO ADDRESS PARENT STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND SCHOOL CLIMATE IN LC FF IS A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT FOR ELOISE. MOST OF WHICH WERE NOT PREPARED WITH THE SKILL SETS AND PRACTICES NECESSARY TO DO THIS WORK AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY WOULD PROVIDE ONE TIME FUNDING TO BUILD THE CAPACITY AT ALL LEVELS OF THE SYSTEM TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND SCHOOL CLIMATE. FUNDING WOULD ACCELERATE AND SCALE INNOVATIVE MODELS ENSURE THE STATE EVALUATES AND SHARES BEST PRACTICES WIDELY AND STRENGTHENS COUNTIES. THAT THEY CAN CARRY THIS WORK ON BEYOND THE STATE INVESTMENT. THESE TWO THINGS ARE DEEPLY INTERTWINED AND ARE THE LYNCHPIN OF AL CFF AS YOU HEARD FROM ROBERT SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS COMBINED WITH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CAN LEAD TO REALLY POWERFUL CHAINS. OUR FRAMEWORK HERE THIS REPORT SHOWS THAT SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS ASSESS SAFETY RELATIONSHIPS CONDITIONS FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT. THE STATE HAS PUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO BUILD CAPACITY IN THE SYSTEM FOR NEW IN MAJOR CHANGES LIKE COMMON CORE NOW IS THE TIME TO PUT THAT SAME INVESTMENT INTO THE NEW AND MAJOR CHANGE AROUND SCHOOL CRIME AND ENGAGEMENT.
