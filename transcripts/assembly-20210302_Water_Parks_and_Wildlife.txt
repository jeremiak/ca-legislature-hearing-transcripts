WITH THE- PROJECTS. A GOOD MORNING MISS CHAIRMAN. OF THE NEXT. PLEASURE YOUR YOU. I AM A MOM LOOKING THAT- THE DIRECT OF DEPARTMENT AND REC. AND I VERY MUCH YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN EXPERIENCE. YOU KNOW AS WE EXPERIENCE THIS WORLD THAT IS CHANGING SO RAPIDLY BEFORE IT. I WANT TO REMIND US THAT THE FIRST PUBLIC LAND SET ASIDE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY SATISFIED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY OR NOT WAS YOU SOMEBODY. THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY YEARS. WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN CARRYING FORWARD BEACH TRADITIONS. AND CERTAINLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'RE SEEING THAT THE CHRISTIAN TRADITIONS THAT WE- PART IN TERMS OF LAND MANAGEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN SERVED. SO CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS IS LOOKING AT BRINGING TOGETHER THE BEST WHAT IS THE- WE NEED ORGANIZATION WITH OUR PART PARTNERS AND WITH THE PUBLIC AT LARGE WE NEED THE BEST WITH THEM. CONSTABLE AS WE MANAGE AND REBUILD THE PARKS AND AS WE CREATE PARKS FOR THE FUTURE. SO I AM COMMITTING THAT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING AND WHAT WE ARE AND HAVE BEEN. IS A POINT THE BEST KNOWLEDGE IN SCIENCE THAT INCLUDES. ACTIONS AND DECISIONS THAT ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. PRACTICES OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION. CAPTION OF CULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES THE ENHANCEMENT OF BIODIVERSITY AND HABITATS IN THESE PUBLIC LANDS AND THE LANDS THAT ARE ADJACENT TO PARKS BY WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS. AND WE'RE WE ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSING OR CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PARK LEADERS FOR THIS CENTURY. GOING FORWARD WE ACTUALLY ARE IN A MOMENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE DEVELOPING THE TRADITIONS FOR THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS AND SO WE'RE EXTRAORDINARILY EXCITED ABOUT WORKING WITH THE COLLECTIVE. IN APPROACHING THAT GOAL. THE WORK DONE BY CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS STAFF PARK STAKEHOLDERS- ALONG WITH THE PARKS FORWARD IN TRANSFORMATION CHANGE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. HAS SET A REALLY INCREDIBLE POSITIVE TRAJECTORY FOR THIS DEPARTMENT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT MOMENTUM. PERSONALLY I HAVE BEEN A LIFELONG STUDENT OF THE NATURAL WORLD AND ACTUALLY OF HISTORY. I AM A STUDENT OF STATE NATIONAL PARKS AND PUBLIC LANDS AND AS AN ADULT I'VE CONTINUALLY ENGAGE WITH PUBLIC LANDS IS A PARK RANGER. AS A PERSONNEL SPECIALIST IN PARKS VOLUNTEER IS A SCIENCE PROFESSIONAL FUNDRAISER RESOURCES MANAGER I'VE WORKED AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN AVID PARK VISITOR A FULL TIME DAD FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND MORE. I LOVE PARKS I LOVE PUBLIC LANDS AND THE WATERS OF THIS STATE ANNALYNNE ALONG OUR COAST. MY WIFE AND I REYES OUR DAUGHTERS EXPLORING THESE PARKS AND EXPLORING THE PLANET AS MUCH AS WE COULD. OUR DAUGHTERS AND I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY REFER TO THEMSELVES AS CITIZENS OF THE WORLD. THERE COULD BE NO GREATER PRIVILEGE IN MY LIFE THAN TO SERVE YOU YEAH OUTDOORS IN THE PUBLIC. I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT- ON STEPPING INTO THIS ROLE ON SEPTEMBER FIRST IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC. THERE WERE TWENTY TWO PARTS THAT WERE ON FIRE MOST OF CALIFORNIA WAS ON FIRE. AND AS YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THIS YEAR THE AVERAGE ACRES THAT BURNED IN CALIFORNIA IN A FIRE YEAR WAS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. THIS YEAR WE SAW OVER FOUR AND A HALF MILLION ACRES BURNED IN OUR WILDLIFE. AND THE EXTRAORDINARY THING. IS THAT THIS YEAR THE FIRE SEASON RATHER THAN ENDING IN NOVEMBER AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE ACTUALLY CONTINUED RIGHT THROUGH DECEMBER WE ARE LIVING IN A VERY ACTIVE TIME OF SEEN THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SO AT THE HEART OF WHAT WE DO WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON ALL OF THAT WHICH AS WE KNOW THIS YEAR WHAT WE SAW WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY INCREASE IN VISITOR SHIPPED TO ALL THE PUBLIC LANDS. MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS ARE. UP TO TWO TIMES THE VISITATION THAT WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE PAST AND I THINK VERY IMPORTANTLY. I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. IS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THESE PUBLIC LANDS AND PARKS ARE IN CENTRAL LANDSCAPES. THEY'RE ESSENTIAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. FOUR THE CALL HEALTH OR MENTAL HEALTH. I MIGHT EVEN SAY FOR SPIRITUAL HELP AND FOR SOCIAL SOCIAL HEALTH. OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BETTER OFF BECAUSE OF THE PARKS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO SO AS A TEAM WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE PLACES WHERE THEY CAN GO. NEARBY AND FAR AWAY TO HELP RESTORE YOUR PHYSICAL MENTAL AND SOCIAL HEALTH WE NEED MORE THAN EVER SO I LOOK FORWARD TO STRENGTHENING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS ALONG WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY WITH OUR PARTNERS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS TIME. THANK YOU DIRECTOR THERE WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER ON THE AGENDA- DIRECTOR- OH WELL. FIGHT LIFE AND FISHERIES DIVISION FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF FISH AND WILDLIFE- STAFFORD LAYER PLEASE. REPLY YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- STAFFORD LATER ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES DIVISION FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. SO I KIND OF JUST ONE OF. EXPRESS MY TESTIMONY THAT WE ARE ON THE SERIES OF EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAD- EXPERIENCED ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE OF THE DEPARTMENT'S MANAGEMENT JOB RESPONSIBILITIES- IN EARLY MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY- THE FISH AND WILDLIFE WE FORMED AN INTERNAL CODE OF THE TASK FORCE LIVE AT THE STATE HOME ORDERS. WE BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT IT- APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY PLUS PERCENT OF OUR WORKFORCE UNDER TELEWORK CONDITIONS MISSION CRITICAL AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE STAFF REMAINED WORKING IN THE FIELD UNDER CODE SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND GUIDELINES. WITH THE STATE HOME ORDERS THAT BEGAN TO ARISE IN MARCH AND APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE MEET IMMEDIATELY BEGAN GETTING QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC WHETHER IT'S OKAY TO GO FISHING WAS IT OKAY TO GO OUTSIDE AND RECORD. MANY PORTS AND HARBORS AND OTHER PUBLIC ACCESS LOCATIONS WERE CLOSED BY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS AND WE WERE WE WERE REFERRED AND EXPRESSED TO THE PUBLIC THAT THEY NEED TO DO IT HERE THOSE LOCAL ORDERS AND ORDINANCES. IN MID TO LATE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY WE ALSO BEGAN TO HEAR CONCERNS ABOUT LARGE FISHING TOURNAMENTS THESE TOURNAMENTS WERE LOCATED IN RURAL COUNTIES WHEN THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT PARTICIPANTS TRAVELING GREAT DISTANCES OFTEN EXCEEDING A HUNDRED PLUS MILES AND BRINGING COVE IT TO THEIR COUNTIES WHERE THERE WERE LOWER INCIDENCE OF. POSITIVITY WE NOTIFIED TOURNAMENT ORGANIZERS TO PLEASE- VOLUNTARILY POSTPONE OR CANCEL THESE EVENTS. TO A LATER DATE WHEN KOBE CONCERNS WERE LESSEN WE HAD NO IDEA WHEN THOSE CONCERNS WOULD BE LASSEN- LATER IN MARCH AND EARLY APRIL THE DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. WERE APPROACHED BY ESIGHT SIERRA COUNTIES. SIERRA NEVADA COUNTY IS THAT WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE UPCOMING TROUT FISHING OCHRE. AND THIS EVENT OCCURS AT THE END OF APRIL. INTERNET OFTEN BRINGS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VISITORS TO THESE RURAL COUNTIES AND THEY- AT THE END OF THIS CALL FISH MASS AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH A LARGE PUBLIC CAL SURGE AND STRESSED THEIR LOCAL HEALTH CARE- OPERATIONS. SO THEY REQUESTED THAT WE POSTPONE THE FISHING SEASON OPENER WE WORKED WITH THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION THE COMMISSION GAVE THE DIRECTOR DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY- OFFICIALS AND UPON A- RICK FORMAL REQUEST BY THE COUNTIES- THE DIRECTOR COULD POSTPONE OR OR DELAYED THE FISHING OPENER. AND THAT HAD A SUNSET DATE MAY THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND EVENTUALLY- FISHING WAS DELAYED- IN ALPINE MONO IN YOU KNOW AND SIERRA COUNTIES AND I MUST SAY THESE COUNTIES RELY VERY HEAVILY UPON THE RECREATIONAL- THE ECONOMY TO- SUPPORT THERE- COUNTY BUDGETS AND ACTIVITIES SO IT WAS A BIG ECONOMIC IT. TO THOSE COUNTIES TO- TAKE THAT STEP AND ASK FOR A DELAY. AS OF JUNE FIRST ALL THESE COUNTY SAID READ OPEN FISHING. REQUIREMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE OWNS AND MANAGES OVER SEVEN HUNDRED PLUS PROPERTIES EXCEEDING OVER ONE POINT ONE BILLION ACRES ACROSS THE STATE FOR WILDLIFE AND HABITAT VALUES. PUBLIC VISITS TO STATE OWNED WILDLIFE AREAS AND ECOLOGICAL RESERVES INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AS THE PUBLIC SOUGHT PERSONAL RELIEF FROM THE STAND HOMEWARDS RECREATIONAL USES FROM HUNTING FISHING HIKING BOATING AND OTHER USES PUT MORE PEOPLE OUT IN OPEN AREAS AND WE HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE SALES WERE UP APPROXIMATELY 10% FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. DUE TO THE INCREASE OF PEOPLE SEEKING RECREATIONAL OUTLETS FROM BEING COOPED UP AT HOME. CONCURRENT WITH THIS INCREASE IN PUBLIC USE OF OPEN SPACE AND WILDLANDS WE HAVEN'T SEEN AN INCREASE IN HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS. IN OPEN SPACES IN IN THE URBAN WILDLAND INTERFACE WE HAVE OVER SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED CONFLICTS ANNUALLY AND WE HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN WILDLIFE ATTACKS ON PEOPLE AS THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE OUT NO OPEN SPACES AND COMING INTO CONTACT WITH LOT MORE WILDLIFE. NOW PIVOTING AFTER THE SUMMER OF ALL OF THIS GOING ON. LATE AUGUST AND EARLY SEPTEMBER THE STATE IS- DIRECTOR CAN TERO- MENTIONED. WE EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST WILDFIRE DISASTER IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY OVER FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES BURNED. THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND SOME OF THE STATE'S LARGEST PRIVATE TIMBERLAND OWNERS CLOSED THEIR LANDS TO PUBLIC USE. IN TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ADDITIONAL WILDFIRES AND THEREBY STRESSING AN ALREADY OVERTAXED FIRE RESPONSE NETWORK. BERMAN CAN CURRENTLY CLOSE FIFTEEN WILDLIFE AREAS AND ECOLOGICAL RESERVES THAT WERE WITHIN OR IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THESE LARGE AREAS OF HIGH AND EXTREME WILDFIRE RISKS. THESE CLOSURES OCCURRED JUST AS MANY OF THE MOST ICONIC HUNTING SEASONS WERE BEGINNING TO TAKE PLACE. ROCKSON ONLY FOURTEEN DIFFERENT HUD SON THAT THE PUBLIC LOST ALL OR A MAJORITY OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTAKE IN THAT ACTIVITY MANY OF THESE SITES COST HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN TAG THESE AND SOME MEMBERS HAD WAITED OVER TWENTY YEARS TO BUILD UP ENOUGH PREFERENCE POINTS TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY- HOW THE COMPETITIVE DRAW. THE DEPARTMENT WORKS WITH THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TO REFUND TAG FEES AND RESTORE THEIR PREFERENCE POINTS SO THEY WOULD HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE TO PARTAKE IN THIS ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY. PIVOTING TO THE LATER FALL. IN LATE OCTOBER AND EARLY NOVEMBER THE WATERFOWL HUNTING SEASON ARE PRESENTED NEIGHBORHOOD MAJOR CHALLENGES AS HUNTERS DESCENDED UPON STATE AND FEDERAL REFUGES. AND THE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE CONTACT LIST- CHECK INS AN EMPLOYEE CODE SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND GUIDELINES TO ENSURE STOP AND PUBLIC SAFETY AS THEY WERE PARTAKING IN THESE ACTIVITIES. WITH THE TREMENDOUS SURGEON CODE CASES DRING THIS TIME IN NEW STAY AT HOME ORDERS THAT INCLUDED RESTRICTIONS ON PUBLIC CAMPING. MANY OF OUR AREAS WE HAD TO CLOSE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS- THE PUBLIC FROM CAMPING ON THESE WILDLIFE AREAS. WE ALSO RESTRUCTURED IN RESTRICTED OUR HOURS OF OPERATION. THIS RESULTED IN LONG LINES OF THE PUBLIC HARD ON PUBLIC ROADWAYS WAITING TO ENTER THESE PUBLIC HUNTING AREAS AT VERY EARLY HOURS IN THE MORNING OFTEN UNDER VERY FOGGY CONDITIONS YEAH PRESENTED A PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT ON THE HIGHWAY. OVERALL WE'VE SEEN A TREMENDOUS UPTICK IN RECREATIONAL USE OF PUBLIC LANDS THIS PAST YEAR AND IT'S RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN TRASH AND STRESSED SANITATION FACILITIES ON STATE PROPERTIES. THIS IS HIGHLIGHTED A EED FOR INCREASED PUBLIC AMENITIES AND APPROPRIATE SIGNAGE THAT CREATES A WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY IN AREAS SURROUNDING URBAN AREAS. IT WAS A VERY VERY BUSY YEAR AND WE'RE PROUD TO OF MET THE CHALLENGES TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND HEALTHY RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIA'S AND I THINK YOU AND I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU DIRECTOR GOING TO HOLD OFF ON THE QUESTION STILL AFTER ALL THE PANELISTS ON THIS FIRST- SEGMENT BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT INSIGHT- THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED WILL WANT TO OUR NEXT A- SPEAKER OR PANELIST IS. NORMA IF YOU'D GARCIA GONZALEZ DIRECTOR OF COUNTY LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGIONAL PARKS AND OPEN SPACE DISTRICT. WELCOME- NORMA. GOOD MORNING AND YOU ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE FOR HAVING YOU SPEAK TODAY IT IS MY DISTINCT HONOR TO SHARE WITH YOU THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT PARK CITY LADY TO PROVIDE RESPITE. PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY RESIDENTS. BUT SPECIFICALLY TO ARE VULNERABLE FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT BY IMPACT A BY COBIT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY PARKS AND RECREATION IS ONE OF THE MOST DYNAMIC PARK SYSTEMS IN THE STATE IF NOT THE NATION. PROVIDING TEN MILLION COUNTY RESIDENTS WITH REGIONAL PARKS TRAILS LAKES. NATURAL AREAS WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES AND GOLF COURSES BOTANICAL GARDENS. THE QUESTION CENTERS AND MUCH MORE. WE ALSO PROVIDE LOCAL RECREATION PROGRAMMING AND SERVICES TO OVER ONE MILLION. UNINCORPORATED RESIDENTS WHICH INCLUDE COMMUNITY CENTERS SENIOR CENTERS OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE SPORT COURTS AND FIELDS. AND HUNDREDS OF PLAYGROUNDS NOT TO MENTION OUR VAST PUBLIC RESTROOM SYSTEM. Y. LAS ANIMAS COUNTY PARK SYSTEM RECEIVES MORE THAN FIFTEEN MILLION VISITS ON AN AVERAGE YEAR. DURING COLD AND WE EXCEEDED AVERAGE ATTENDANCE VISITS. JOINT COLBERT MANY SECTORS PARKS NEVER CLOSE ITS DOORS ARE PARKS WE NEED OPEN TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SAFETY NET SERVICES LIKE FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS WE CONTINUE TO OPPORTUNITY FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS A WEEK. LEADING EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TO TWENTY SIX HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS EVERY TIME. FORTY POUNDS OF FOOD ENOUGH TO FEED A FAMILY OF FOUR FOR A WEEK. ARGENIS WE TRANSFORMED INTO HOMELESS SHELTERS AND WENT TO ADMITTED SHELTERS DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER OUR PARKS WORK TRUSTED VOTING CENTRES. TRUSTED COBIT FIVE FIVE TESTING SITES IN VACCINATION SITES IN THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. WE PROVIDED CHILDCARE FOR ESSENTIAL WONDERFUL WORKERS WHO COULD NOT TELL THE WORK AND WHILE SCHOOLS WERE ONLINE WE PIVOTED TO PROVIDE TO PROVIDE A SAFE OUTDOOR PROGRAMMING FOR YOUTH AND TEENS. AND OUR PARK SERVED AS EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTERS THE WHAT OUR WATER IN OUR LAKES IS DROPS FOR THE BOBCAT FIRED AND THE MANY OTHER FIRES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY HAS GIVEN A NEW MEETING. TO PARKS MAKE LIFE BETTER. IN TWENTY SIX THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION COMPLETED A COUNTY WIDE PARK NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AND I'M PRESIDENT EFFORT TO DOCUMENT CRITICAL NEEDS IN CITIES AND UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES A LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WILL NOT FROM THE PARK NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND I'M NOT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO STATE WELL MAINTAINED AND PROGRAM PARKS AND GREEN SPACE. PARKS ARE POISED TO EFFECTUATE EQUITY AT A NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL IMPACTING CLIMATE CHANGE HEALTH AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES. BY PRIORITIZING AND ADDRESSING PARKING NEEDS IN COMMUNITIES WE ARE DIRECTLY TACKLING RACIAL INEQUITIES. AND LET ME BE CLEAR THERE IS NO RACIAL JUSTICE WITHOUT PARK EQUITY. RECENTLY THE PREVENTION INSTITUTE AND NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATION ALONG WITH UCLA AND THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION PUBLISHED RESEARCH LINKING THE LACK OF GREEN SPACE WITH LIFE EXPECTANCY. USING OUR PARKING NEEDS ASSESSMENT AS THE BASIS OF THEIR RESEARCH THE STUDY FOUND IF ALL OF THE CENSUS TRACT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH PART DEFICIT AND LOW TREE CANOPY LEVELS. HAD AN INCREASE IN PARK ACREAGE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND YEARS IN LIFE EXPECTANCY COULD BE GAINES. TARGETING INVESTMENTS IN PARK INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT THE HEALTH OF LATINO AND BLACK RESIDENTS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. LOS ANGELES COUNTY PARKS AND RECREATION WITH OUR MANY PARTNERS WILL BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT OUR RURAL AND REGIONAL AREAS OF COUNTY TO INCORPORATE INTO THE PARK NEEDS ASSESSMENT. WE ARE CALLING TO SEPARATE THE REGIONAL AND RURAL ADDITION KIND OF TIMING COULDN'T BE BETTER. WITH BIDEN'S NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROTECT 30% OF US LANDS AND 30% OF US OCEANS BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND THE GOVERNOR NEW SUMS PLEDGE TO CONSERVE 30% OF LANDING COASTAL WATERS ALSO BY TWENTY THIRTY IN CALIFORNIA TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND CONSERVE BIODIVERSITY AND BOOST CLIMATE RESILIENCE. LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGIONAL RULE ADDITION WILL ENSURE THAT THIS COUNTY IS ALIGNED WITH THE GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVES VISIT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFYING GAPS OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAND ACQUISITION AND AREAS WERE FINDING SHOULD. BE PRIORITIZED ARE FOCUSED. CITI BANK FAMILY THROUGH THE PLAN OUR MINIATURE. ON OLD WASTELAND WITH POSITIVE RESULTS FOR BIODIVERSITY AND CARBON CAPTURE MANY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY PORT PART PORT COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO REAT FOR. THE LOT THE LACK OF TREES IN THESE AREAS IT'S A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND WELLNESS ISSUE AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS BECAUSE OF THEIR ZIP CODE. I'M ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THE MANY BENEFITS OF TREES. CALIFORNIA CLIMATE BOND SHOULD SUPPORT THE STRATEGIC PLANTING OF TREES IN URBAN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE MOSTLY NEEDED AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONTEXT WHERE TREES ARE PROPOSED. TO BE PLANTED AND NOT JUST THE OVERALL NUMBER OF TREES. CLIMATE RESILIENCE MUST ALSO INCLUDE HUMAN AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE THE PARKING RECREATION SECTOR OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES SPECIFICALLY FOR AT RISK YOUTH. A GOOD EXAMPLE IN L. A. COUNTY IS OF OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CONSERVATION COURSE TO PROVIDE. ON THE JOB TRAINING FOR AT RISK YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS LAST YEAR MY DEPARTMENT HIRED FOURTEEN YOUNG ADULTS FROM THE CONSERVATION COURSE MANY OF THEM SYSTEMS INVOLVES YOU. TO WORK AS FULL TIME GROUNDS MAINTENANCE AND LANDSCAPING STAFF AND ON A SIDE NOTE. WITH JOBS NEW JOBS BEING SO SCARED BECAUSE OF KOBE ON APRIL FIRST I WILL BRING ON THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE OF ALL YOU. TO WORK AT OUR PARKS. AS PART OF A YOUTH THAT WORK INITIATIVE. STATE BONDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT JOB CREATION AND BONNEVAL COMMUNITIES. AND INCENTIVIZE LIVING WAGE JOBS AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU. ACCORDING TO RECENT ESTIMATES CALIFORNIA HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND BROWNFIELD SITES. THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BROWNFIELD SITES ARE STARK PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF UNRESOLVED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES FACING HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED NEIGHBORHOODS HOWEVER NEW INVESTMENTS FROM THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE BOND CAN'T PROVIDE TRANSFORMATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT GREEN HEALTHY AND ECONOMICALLY VIBRANT COMMUNITIES. WHILE LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS KNOWN AS AN URBANIZED AREA IT IS ACTUALLY PART OF A BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT CALLED THE CALIFORNIA FLORISTIC PROPONENTS WHICH IS THE PRETTIEST COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY WITH MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED RECORDED SPECIES. AND SITS IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOUR THOUSAND MILE BIRD MIGRATION FLYWAY THAT IS USED BY AT LEAST A BILLION BIRDS ANNUALLY. BIODIVERSITY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTH ARE PROMOTED BY THE COUNTY'S MANY PARKS INCLUDING LOCAL PARKS IN URBAN COMMUNITIES STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS SHOULD RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT FROM POINT ROLE THAT URBAN PARKS PLAY IN CONSERVING AND ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY THEREBY HELPING TO MITIGATE AND ADAPT TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. LASTLY I WANT TO SHARE A STATE BOND FUNDING STATE BOND FUNDING AT WORK. WHAT WE WANNA PARK POCKET PARKS IS A HALF OF MY HAPPENED A BIT IN SIZE AND IS MUCH NEEDED IN A VERY HIGH NEED PARK COMMUNITY WITH OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS AND OVER FOUR THOUSAND YOU. AND ALTHOUGH ITS NAME IS ONE OF PARK THERE IS NO CURRENT PARK IN THIS COMMUNITY AND YOU CAN VISUALLY SEE THE DENSITY IN THE SOUTHEAST COMMUNITY IN THE MATERIALS THAT I PROVIDED TO YOU. THE CREATION OF THIS NEW PARK WILL HELP TO ADDRESS. I'M BY HELP TO ADDRESS THE PART DENSITY BY INSTALLING A MICHAEL FORREST A THIRTY EIGHT DROUGHT TOLERANT NATIVE TREES ON A SITE THAT HAS BEEN VACANT FOR OVER TWO DECADES. THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION POTENTIAL THESE TREES IS ESTIMATED TO BE EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND POUNDS OF CO TWO OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE TREES. THE TREE PLANTINGS WILL ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS BY ALLEVIATING THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT PROVIDING COOLING FOR THE COMMUNITY AND CAPTURING PARTICULATE CONTAMINANTS AND BALA TILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO IMPROVE STORMWATER CAPTURE TREATMENT AND INFILTRATION THE POINT FIGHT WILL CAPTURE AND TREAT A THIRTY TWO ACRE DRAINAGE AREA IN THE COMMUNITY BY INSTALLING SIX DRY WELLS WITHIN THE SITE TO CLIENTS AND CAPTURE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND GALLONS OF WATER INFILTRATED. ALL THIS GONNA HAPPEN ACRE SITE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOUTHEAST. MACHINE RESIGNING M. P. M. P. H. SHE IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOSTATISTICS FOR THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO PLEASE WELCOME. ROGERS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU TO THE SAMPLING OF WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK. AND FOR THE PRESENTATIONS THAT CAME BEFORE ME THAT WAS SO INSPIRATIONAL. I AM A PEDIATRICIAN AND I ALSO RUN A PROGRAM AND NATURE PRESCRIPTION PROGRAM WHERE WE TAKE LOW INCOME FAMILIES INTO NATURE IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR- REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT. AND DESPITE ALL THE SUFFERING THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW I REALLY HAVE CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM IN NATURE IT IS PART OF MY- TO LISTEN- NATURE SUCH AS THAT FOUND IN PARKS AND PUBLIC LANDS. HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. A COMMUNITY RESOURCE FOR RELIEVING STRESS AND ENSURING HEALTH. AND I COULD GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT THE RESTORATIVE EFFECTS OF NATURE ON THE TENSION CREATIVITY BLOOD PRESSURE CORTISOL BUT IN SUMMARY OVER A LIFETIME. LIVING IN OR NEAR NATURE MAKES US LIVE LONGER AS WE JUST HEARD- DESCRIBED BY MS GARCIA GONZALEZ- IN LOS ANGELES AN EXAMINATION OF ALL THE CENSUS TRACTS- SHOW THAT. I'M HAVING PARKS AND TREE CANOPY NEED. WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LIFE EXPECTANCY TO ME THAT'S A CALL. TO ACCESS TO. NATURE IS A TOOL TO ADDRESS DEEPLY ENTRENCHED HEALTH DISPARITIES AND A STUDY LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE UNITED. KINGDOM. CENSUS SHOWED THAT EXPOSURE TO GREEN STATING IMPACT OF POVERTY ON. CARDIOVASCULAR THE DISEASE AND THAT'S RIGHT IN TEENS- SO IN OUR GROUP M. AT UCSF WE DID A NATIONAL SURVEY WE LOOKED AT A NATIONAL SURVEY STATES AND WE SAW THAT WHILE ONLY AROUND 25% ACTUALLY THAT'S PRETTY HIGH OF CHILDREN HAD REPORTED NO ACCESS TO PARKS THOSE WHO SAID THEY HAD NO ACCESS TO PARKS WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE NO. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PER WEEK. MORE THAN FOUR OF DAILY SCREEN TIME THIS WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- AND INADEQUATE SLEEP. AND THEY WERE ALSO MORE LIKELY. TO BE OVERWEIGHT OR TO HAVE AN ADHD DIAGNOSIS. THE THING THAT'S REALLY A CALL TO ACTION OUT FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORLD IS THAT- EXPOSURE TO NATURE IS ALSO ONE OF THE METHODS WE HAVE. TO DECREASE THE SPREAD OF KUWAIT- SO FIRST OF ALL EVIDENCE IS ACCUMULATING THAT NATURE CAN HELP HELP US GET THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS OF ISOLATION A SURVEY OF THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN. JAPAN SHOW THAT HAVING A ROOM THAT HAS YOU WOULD NEED. SURE OR HAVE VISITS TO NATURE DURING THE PANDEMIC IMPROVEMENT. SO HAVE PERMITS THAT CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES SHOW THAT. THERE WAS LESS DISCREPANCY BETWEEN RACES IN KOBE- RATES SO. THE RACIAL DISPARITY THAT WE'VE SEEN IN KOBE WHAT'S LESS IN AREAS THAT HAD MORE GREEN. AND THEN MY GROUP THAT A META ANALYSIS LOOKING AT MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND PAPERS TO SEE WHERE COKE IT WAS TRANSMITTED AND WE SAW THAT LESS THAN 10% OF ALL GLOBAL COATED TRANSMISSIONS OCCURRED OUTDOORS.AND AT THE RATE OF IT THE CHANCE OF GETTING CLOBBERED OUTDOORS IS ABOUT TWENTY TIMES LESS THAN IT IS INDOORS AND SO IN COMBINATION WITH MASKS AND DISTANCE AND LESS DENSITY. BEING OUTDOORS IS ACTUALLY AN INFECTION CONTROL MEASURE. SO ALL THIS TO SAY AS YOU ALREADY KNEW ACCESS TO NATURE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF HEALTH- AND WE IN PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD BE HELPING YOU INCREASE PHYSICAL ACCESS TO NATURE BUT WE ALL HAVE TO KNOW AS A GROUP THAT JUST HAVING NATURE NEAR YOU IS NOT ENOUGH- AS WE NOTE. THAT THE- NATURE IS NOT EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES NOT HEARD THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER BUT EVEN WHEN PEOPLE LIVE NEAR NATURE IF IT'S NOT ASAFE PLACE. THEY WILL NOT SPEND TIME IN IT- AND WE HAVE ALL BEEN WITNESSED THIS YEAR AND IN THE PAST TO REALLY pAGAINST. PEOPLE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY- AS WELL AS OTHER ETHNICITIES LATIN ACTS ASIAN AMERICANS MUSLIM AMERICANS IN OUTDOOR SPACES JUST FOR THE FACT OF BEING OUTSIDE. AND ACTS LIKE THAT THEY ARE HORRIFIC AND THEY ARE ALSO SOCIAL SIGNALS. TO FAMILIES NOT TO BE OUTDOORS AND NOT TO BE IN NATURE. AND SURFACE ACCESS IS ONE THING. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO WORK HRD ON MAKING THESE SPACES RACISM FREE AND MAKING SURE THAT FAMILIES FEEL A SENSE OF OWNERSHIP AND BEING OUTDOORS. AND IN THE CONTEXT OF COVE IT THESE TRAGEDIES AND INEQUITIES ARE SUPER DISTRESSING BECAUSE THE RIGHT TO BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE AND TO PLAY AND TO BE IN COMMUNITY OUTDOORS. IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE WILL HEAL. PANDEMIC SO IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES I'M JUST GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME STORIES THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MY PATIENTS I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT IS CLEARLY AN INCREASE IN PARK VISITOR **** BUT THE KIDS THAT I WORK WITH- ARE NOT. I DON'T SEE THEM REFLECTED IN THOSE NUMBERS SO WE- HAVE BEEN DOING INTERVIEWS WITH THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE IN THIS URBAN CLINIC- AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUOTES THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID. THERE ARE SOME CITY PARKS THAT ARE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE BUT THEY'RE UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW OF. IN WHAT WILL WORK BEST JUST TOOK ONE PLAY. REALLY THE ONLY TIME IT UPSIDE. DOWN THE BLOCK AND I'M THE ONLY JESSICA GB DUE. TO VIOLENT CRIMES THAT WAS A MONTH. AND I WISH THERE COULD BE MORE THINGS FOR CHILDREN TO DO THAT ARE SAFE AND HEALTHY FOR THEM. AND THAT THEY FELT ENGAGEMENT. AND JOY AND I WISH IT WOULD COULD BE CLOSER IT WASN'T SUCH A CHALLENGE FOR US TO GET ACCESS TO IT. REGIONAL PARKS ARE ALL FAR AWAY FROM WHERE WE'RE LIVING. WE DON'T HAVE A CAR. AND SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED THEY'VE CUT DOWN ON BUS ROUTES AND SUSPENDED A LOT OF SERVICES. NOBODY'S COMING TO GIVE US A RIDE ANYWHERE R TO HELP US IN ANY WAY THAT'S ANOTHER MONTH. I MISS GOING OUTSIDE. SOMETIMES I HAVE DREAMS ABOUT PLAYING IN NATURE WITH MY STUFFED ANIMALS. AND THEY COME TO LIFE. THEY CAN MOVE AND WALK AND TALKON THEIR OWN. THAT'S A SEVEN YEAR OLD. I WISH I HAD A BACKYARD BECAUSE THEN WE COULD GO OUTSIDE AND ENJOY BEING IN NATURE. TO HAVE GRASS UNDER YOUR FEET BEING OUT THERE WITH THE WIND BLOWING. IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN SITTING ON THE PORCH LOOKING AT CARS DRIVING BY WHICH IS NOT ONE OF OUR FAVORITE THINGS TO DO. I WISH THAT CODE IT DIDN'T MAKE A SO CONFINED BECAUSE I THINK THAT BY CUT CLOSING US OFF FROM NATURE YOU'VE ALSO CLOSED US OFF. FROM A PART OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE. AND AS A COMMUNITY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE IN NATURE AND FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING TO DO BESIDES BEING COOKED COOKED AT HOME UP. AT HOME SORRY I GET EMOTIONAL. TAKING THAT AWAY IS HURTING PEOPLE MORE THAN IT'S HELPING. EVEN THOUGH WE WANT TO PROTECT EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON NATURE PROVIDES ITS OWN PROTECTION AS WELL. BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOING AWAY. SO WE NEED TO FIND A HEALTHY WAY TO DO IT. AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE'RE HEARING ESPECIALLY FROM FAMILIES WHO HAVE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. OR TEENAGERS THAT THEY ARE REALLY SUFFERING AT HOME. SO WHAT DO WE DO. I WANT TO SAY THAT AS PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDERS PEOPLE WHO CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE CONTROL OF CLUB AT NINETEEN. I FOR ONE AM HERE STANDING WITH YOU WITH MY SLEEVES ROLLED UP TO SAY THAT SHELTER IN PLACE DOES NOT HAVE TO MEAN SHELTER INSIDE. AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP YOU MANAGE THIS. INFLUX OF PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE HAVING BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO AND WE NEED YOU TO STAY OPEN. WHEN I SEE PICTURES OF LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE PARK I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE THAT'S IN PLACE OF LOTS OF PEOPLE INSIDE SPREADING MORE COPE WITH AND THEY WOULD IF THEY WERE OUTSIDE. PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR FAMILIES FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. I WOULD MUCH RATHER AN EXTENDED FAMILY SPEND TIME IN THE PARK. THEN IN THEIR HOME. THE RISK OF COVERT IS LOWER OUTDOORS AND- I FOR ONE WOULD EVEN BE HAPPY SEEING SCHOOLS USE PARKS TO GET OUTDOORS. AND OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES. HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC LANDS IN ORDER TO STAY OPEN. THE SECOND THING THAT I THINK WE CAN DO IS REALLY A LINE HOW WE SPEAK ABOUT. TIME IN NATURE AND HOW COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE TIME IN NATURE. ACCESS TO NATURE IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT STANDING IN PARKS. HEALING IN NATURE IS ABOUT PLAYING AND BEING IN COMMUNITY AND FEELING GONNA SHIP AND KNOWING THAT YOUR SPACE AND PARKS. IS VALUED. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE FOR ALL OF HUMANITY. BEING IN NATURE RESONATES WHAT WITH ALL OF US WHETHER TEACHING TEENS- CELEBRATION OR IN MY COMMUNITY PERSIAN NEW YEAR'S COMING UP AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A BUNCH OF US WORKS IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND I KNOW THOSE OF YOU FROM LA KNOW THAT FOR SURE. OKAY SO HOW CAN WE BE MOBILIZED TO CLEAN. BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE A LOVE OF NATURE AND I'M IN OUR CULTURES. AND SO LET US HELP YOU TAKE CARE OF NATURE BECAUSE WE NEED IT. VERY MUCH INTO EACH OF YOU THAT HAVE KEPT YOUR PROGRAMS FOR TEENAGERS OPEN THANK YOU THEY ARE IN CRISIS. THERE'S NO SCHOOL FOR THEM THERE'S NO VACCINE FOR THEM WE NEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN GIVE US FOR TEENS. LIKE THAT TOO MUCH TIME I'M SORRY. GOOD THANK YOU DOCTOR THE PLAINTIFF WE'RE WE'RE GONNA JUMP INTO SOME QUESTIONS I KNOW THAT- WE'VE GOT A- NUMBER OF OTHER COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE JOINED US. CAN ADD TEN YOU KNOW FIFTEEN MINUTES OF QUESTION ANSWERS WE DO HAVE TWO OF THE PALACE BUT- YOU'VE ALL BEEN AN EXCELLENT JOB PRESENTING- THE SUBJECT MATTERS THAT THEY THINK WE'RE ALL INTERESTED SO FIRST. QUESTION WILL COME FROM MY COLLEAGUE TO MY FAR RIGHT OVER. HERE MRS REVIEW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION WORK I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE PLAN AND- YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT OUR KIDS AND OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE PARK LANDS I DO HAVE. A QUESTION THOUGH IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY I HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT SOLD- PARKLAND MY OFFICE IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY FOR OVER TWO YEARS- AND TO TRY AND RESTART THE LAND- AND WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY PROGRESS. I SAW IN THE MEANTIME THOSE KIDS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT. THE RECREATION ESPECIALLY DURING COLD FOOD SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK WHAT WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. IS THE COUNTY PUTTING IN PLACE TO ASSURE THAT- THIS AID THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. AND HOW CAN. YOUR SYSTEM PUSHING THAT COMMUNITY AND TRY TO RESTORE THE PARK LAND THAT WAS SOLD. A LONG TIME AGO. TO HAVE THE DIRECTOR OF A- PARKS AND REC- WHO COULD POSSIBLY TAKE ON THAT QUESTION. THE THEIR NUMBER WILL BE UP FOR THAT QUESTION- GOOD MORNING- I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT A LOS ANGELES COUNTY ACTUALLY USES THE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE PARK PRESERVATION ACT WHICH IS A STATE LEGISLATION ACTUALLY AND IT GOVERNS ALL OF THE PARK AND RECREATION ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M AT PARK PRESERVATION IS VERY CLEAR IN REGARDS TO OUR INTERPRETATION THAT PARKS- PARKS WHERE PARK FIND A PUBLIC FUNDING HAS BEEN USED TO PURCHASE- AND DEVELOP- PARTS MUST BE REPLACED ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS SO- THE COUNTY IS NOT THAT. JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY IN REGARDS TO WHERE IT'S SMALL CITIES- DO YOU- DO TAKE THOSE ACTIONS- BUT THEY CAN'T USE THE STATE OUT NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE PARK PRESERVATION ACT TO HOLD THOSE CITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE THAT PARKLAND IS REPLACED ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS AND- IF THERE IS- IF THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE REGIONAL PARK AND OPEN SPACE DISTRICT DOLLARS AND WHICH WERE INVESTED TO PURCHASE- OR DEVELOP THAT LAND OF MY AGENCY- WOULD VERY MUCH I'D BE ENGAGED IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY TO PARK AGENCIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY- THAT I TAKE AWAY PARK LAND AND- THAT IS I THINK A CONTINUOUS NEED THAT WE NEED TO- A CONTINUOUS ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE. AN EDUCATE CITIES THAT THEY CAN'T JUST TAKE A PART OF IT IS THE COMMUNICATED FOR PUBLIC YOU KNOW FOR PUBLIC USE AND CONVERTED TO ANOTHER USE AND ONCE AGAIN WE USE THE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE- PARK PRESERVATION ACT- TO EDUCATE AND INFORM OUR PARTY AGENCIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING PARK LAND AND IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN USE. THERE NEEDS TO BE A ONE TO ONE REPLACEMENT. THANK YOU FOR THAT AGAIN I DO WORKING WITH THIS PARTICULAR FOR NOW OVER TO YEARS ON CHINA TO MOVE ON THAT IN I HAVEN'T SUCCESS THAT STATE. HAS ALSO- IMPOSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE LOT ALONG WITH IT AND I KNOW ALL WHAT IT'S IN THERE BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE AND SO. SO THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO HELP I'M TRYING TO HELP BUT I'M I NEED TO EMPLOY YOUR HELP BECAUSE IT'S THERE'S NO MOVEMENT AND AGAIN OUR KIDS THAT WE ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT HELPING HAVE BEEN MISSING OUT AT LEAST. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE BY THE WAY LONGER THAN THAN THAN THE TWO YEARS SO IF I CAN ASK FOR SOME ASSISTANCE. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU. AND THAT IS THE MEMBER WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU- TO TRY TO ALSO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ANY CITY THAT ABSOLUTELY I WILL REACH OUT TO YOU IN YOUR. OFFICE SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THIS. AS MEMBER THIS IS DIRECTOR. BETTER AND I AM WELL AWARE. THE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND RESOLVING THAT. REALLY ARE. OUR INTENT ABSOLUTELY IS TO BE PROVIDING ACCESS TO. THE PARKS AND PUBLIC LANDS. AND- AND I APPRECIATE WHAT. THERE'S NO DOUBT IT'S JUST SAD BUT WE KNOW IT AND THIS IS A- OBJECT I'M WELL AWARE I'M I KNOW WE'RE BOTH. ON THAT SO LOOK FOR TO WORKING. THANK YOU JUST WOULD LIKE TO JUST I REITERATE THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH MY OFFICE HAND IN HAND AND WE BUT THEY'VE BEEN FANTASTIC THEN. AND TRYING TO GET THE CITY TO MOVE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR IT FOR THAT ASSISTANCE. BUT AGAIN IT'S BEEN OVER TWO YEARS SO MAYBE THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW WE CAN APPLY SOME LOCAL- PRESSURE AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT MOVING AND I WANT TO THANK YOUR DEPARTMENT BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW LITERALLY HOLDING HAT THAT THAT CITY'S HAND AND IT'S STILL THERE'S- BEEN A MOVEMENT I APPRECIATE THAT. THE WITH A QUESTION FROM A CALLING FROM THE SOUNDS AREA FOLLOWED BY SENEGAL. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU ALL THE PRESENTERS- IN PARTICULAR I THINK THE COMMON THEME AND HAS BEEN RECEIVING THIS MORNING WONDERING BECAUSE OF IT. IS THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS ABOUT HAVING ACCESS TO OPEN SPACES DOCTORS. SPOKE VERY SPECIFICALLY TO IT AS DID- BUT DIRECTOR GARCIA GONZALEZ AND INCLUDING AND SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT SHOW THE CONNECTION OF FIVE EXPECTANCY IN ACCESS TO PARK SPACE AND- I APPRECIATE THE- REFERENCE TO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. ON THE THIRTY PERCENT- PRESERVATION AS WELL AS PRESIDENT BIDEN FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT THAT- THAT PULLED THE- ABILITIES LAST YEAR MAYBE THIRTY THIRTY VERY GRATEFUL MY ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES ARE PASSING THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY A PARTIALLY GOT STALLED ON THE SENATE SIDE AND- SO GRATEFUL TO GOVERNOR. INCORPORATED BUT I THINK IT'S AN EXAMPLE WHEN WE PUT THINGS FORWARD HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NATIONAL- WE HAVE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT ALSO NOW- PROCLAIMING THAT THIS IMPORTANT FOR OUR NATION AND SO- I APPRECIATE. THE GOVERNOR- BUT IN FOLLOWING THROUGH EVEN THOUGH THE BILL DID NOT MAKE IT TO HIS DESK MAKING SURE THAT THAT ACT THAT THAT ACCESS AND EQUITY ARE PART OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I HAVE A BILL THIS YEAR TO BE THIRTY. WHICH FOLLOWS UP ON THAT ON ON HIS ON THE ACCESS PIECE BECAUSE MUCH LIKE MANY PARTS OF OUR STATE AND SAN JOSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE IS GOING TO BE SAN JOSE THAT MIGHT BE HALF HOUR FROM THE COAST AND THEY'VE NEVER SEEN THE OCEAN- EN LA AND OTHER PLACES THAT YOU SEE A LOT OF THAT AS WELL BUT I THINK. EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY AS DIRECTOR GARCIA IS ALSO REFERRING TO HELLO THANK THEM THE INTERNAL PARTS AND YOU MADE HALF ACRE PARK'S ONE ACRE THIRTY ACRE PARK CENTER IN- THESE URBAN DESERT FOR PARTS SO EVEN IN PLACES LIKE WHEN THEY DO. THESE RATINGS IN SAN JOSE FOR EXAMPLE- HOW MUCH. OPEN SPACE EXISTS WHO HAS I THAT OPENS. IS A IN YOUR NEIGHBOR. OR IS OPEN SPACE YOU TO DRIVE TO- YOU KNOW YOU DEBORAH THE PRIME WE SEEM LOT OF FOLK. YOU KNOW. RENTING A HOUSE ON THE BEACH OR- GOING CAMP FOR A WEEK. WHO WHO IS THAT ACCESSIBLE AND WAS A NOT X. TO. AND I THINK THAT FOR. WE GET AWAY THE NEED FOR US. TO INVEST I KNOW IT'S HARDER TO INVEST IN PLACES LIKE. AND IT WAS DOWNTOWN LA DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE OR DOWNTOWN OAKLAND. BECAUSE THE COST OF LAND IS MORE THERE'S SO MUCH. PRESSURE TO DEVELOP IT. FOR YOU KNOW FOR PROFIT AND FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO. CONTINUE TO. DENSIFY AND SO. AS WE GO FORWARD NOT JUST WITH THEM. ONE OF THE- 30% GOALS WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT AS WE MOVE THAT'S BEEN REFERRED TO THE CLIMB UP ON WHAT HAVE YOU- HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT. WE ARE. YEAH AND THIS GOES TO A CENTER WILL BE POINT AS WELL JUST IN A MORE SENSE. HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT WE'RE GETTING THESE OPEN SPACES AND PARKS IN COMMUNITIES. THAT NEED IT. AS A PRIORITY BECAUSE- I KNOW THAT. SOMETIMES IS THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE WE CAN. PRESERVE SOME SPACE YOU KNOW THE ONLY WAY OUT OF URBAN AREAS IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO DO THAT. TO BUY UP MAYBE SOME FORMER RENTAL AND THE MAKE IT OFFICE SPACE. IT'S MUCH HARDER TO DO THE WORK EVEN OF OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES AND SO IS THERE A THOUGHT OR A PLAN OF HOW WE CAN GO FORWARD. TO PRIORITIZE IT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT'S THE HARDER WORK. THAT SOMETIMES ENDS UP. PUTTING BEING IN THE- KIND OF THE END OF THE LAST AND THEN AS OF NOW GETTING DONE. BUT IF ANYONE OTHER. TO GET BACK TO THAT WORK SO A LONG WINDED WAY OF SAYING HOW TO BE FIRED. THESE INFILL URBAN PARKS IN A PARK DESERT'S. THIS IS THE RECORD THAT- I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE STATEMENT IN QUESTION. WELL THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS I'D LIKE TO MENTION TWO THINGS IS THAT IN OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR WE HAVE A LOT OF TIMES. WE HAVE OVER TEN MILLION DOLLARS APPROVED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE NEW LAND ACQUISITIONS FOR THE STATE PARK SYSTEM. THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT IS- IN OUR PRIORITY LIST LOOKING AT INTERNAL PIECES THAT WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR PARKS THAT ARE IN. NEAR COMMUNITIES BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO EXPANDING STATE PARK TO LARGER AREAS AND WE LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO BE ABLE TO BEAT MAKING SOMEONE ELSE BUT THEN THE NEXT IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL OF IN STATE PARKS THERE IS A COMMUNITY GRANTS PROGRAM WHICH SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND HAS INVESTED ALMOST THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT ON STATE PARK PROPERTY. AND THESE ARE INVESTMENTS IN PAYING FOR THINGS LIKE NATURE CENTER'S REBUILDING CLARK'S ESTABLISHING TRAILS. PUTTING IN THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY POOLS AND IT'S A GIRL I HAVE TWO GOALS AND- WE WILL THIS YEAR WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FNDS. WHICH WE ARE GOING TO BE DIRECTING TO COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IN A LITTLE LATER TODAY YOU'LL BE HEARING. A PRESENTATION BY CEDRIC MITCHELL WHO RUNS THAT OFFICE SO HE'LL GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT IT BUT I JUST WANT. TO LET YOU KNOW. THAT ONE OF THE- IT PRIORITIES FIRST PARKS THIS YEAR. YEAH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKING A KNOWN. THAT STATE PARK ARE ACTUALLY COMING TO YOUR- AND JUSTIN IN THOSE VERY- THAT. ALLOW FOLKS TO GIVE TE OPPORTUNITY TO RECREATION CLOSE TO HOME. AND MY INTENTION IS THAT MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS THERE WILL ALSO BE MESSAGING THAT SAYS. THESE PARTS ARE YOURS AND THESE PARKS ARE YOURS SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW. THAT PARKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. PART OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP. AND I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING THOSE MESSAGES OUT. TO MAKING% SURE THAT. THAT CITIZENS THROUGHOUT THE STATE START SEEING THAT THERE ARE LOCAL INVESTMENTS COMING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES BY VIRTUE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND- THE EFFORTS OF THE SAME ARTIST GRANTS MANAGERS FOR THESE AREAS. WE HAVE THREE GRANTS PROGRAMS ACTUALLY NOT ONLY IN OUR OFFICE IN FRANCE HERE. PARKS BUT IN DEPARTMENT OF BUILDING AND WATERWAYS WE MANAGE GRANTS. FOR WATER ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES THINGS LIKE NEW PROGRAMS. AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO HELP THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE A GRANTS PROGRAM IN OUR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE PROGRAM WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES INVESTMENTS IN LAND ACQUISITION. AREAS THAT ARE NOT IN STATE PARKSAND HELP RESTORE LANDS AND ALSO MAKE PLANS AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL- H. B. USE AND I'VE- I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS IN A VERY QUICK STORY IS THAT. I USED TO WORK AT UC MERCED FOR A THOUSAND YEARS. AND ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES A COUPLE MY COLLEAGUES WENT WITH ME TO THE ADJACENT OPEN SPACE TO USE THE WORDS AND IT'S OUT OF VERNAL POOL. COMPLEX VERY WHERE LANDSCAPE. A YOUNG WOMAN WHO MONEY FOR THE IN. WE OUT THERE FOR A COUPLE DAYS WITH THIS IS WE UP WITH SCIENCE AND RE. AND SECOND MORNING AFTER WE GET OUT OF OUR TEN AND WAIT UP YES YOU WOMAN. WHO WAS RAY IN RECESS WENT TO SCHOOL TO. IN NOW IT'S BACK IN VERSE. SHE CAME OUT TOWARD A GROUP OF A LOOK LIKE SHE WAS. AND I HAD A ARE YOU OKAY. AND SHE WAS. AND SHE SAID. I DIDN'T KNOW I. LIVED HERE MMHM. AND I THINK THAT WE AS A BROADER. AND ITS PUBLIC LANDS LEADERS AND AS PUBLIC LAND PROFESSIONALS. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE DOES THAT VERY EXPERIENCE. FOR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE I DO THINK. THAT A PART OF THE VALUE HERE IS GIVING ALL THE STUDENTS AND- THE UNDERSTANDING IN THE SENSE OF OWNERSHIP. AND PARTICIPATION IN THE PUBLIC LANDS WORLD OF. THE MOST INCREDIBLE STATE IN THE NATION CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THAT AND WOULD JUST SAY DIRECTORS INTO TO AVOID- MAN AND COME TO US IF YOU IF YOU'RE FINDING THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE TO BE ONE THAT GOES BACK TO THE NORM BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN AN ISSUE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THE LAST COMMENTS ON GRANT PROGRAMS I KNOW THE VERY TOP THIS IS TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF CAMPAIGN ACCOUNT BY ASKING WHAT HAVE YOU BUT YOU KNOW A PLACE WHERE I LIVE- WE ARE WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES AND YES THE PROPERTY VALUE MIGHT BE HIGHER. BUT YOU HAVE YET TO THREE FAMILIES AGAIN AND A HOME AND THEY DON'T HAVE PARTS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND SO THERE CAN BE WAYS AS WE LOOK AT THESE GRANT PROGRAMS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT EVEN THOUGH SOMEONE IS ON A HIGH COST OF LIVING AREA- HIGH PROPERTY VALUE AREA THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS. SO WE CAN NARROW DOWN AND TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AS TO REALLY. CREATING THAT MANY BLACKS SO THANK YOU. I YOU SOME- COMMON. THEME HERE IS THE ISSUE POOR PART. CAN YOU. IN HIGH PERCENTAGE. OF A- PER. KILLED PEOPLE IN. CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND SO CERTAINLY SOME FOLLOW UP ON TERMS OF LANGUAGE. WHEN WE'RE- PUTTING TOGETHER. SECTIONS FOR THESE PARTS- GRADS SOME. HOPE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SENEGAL WOULD LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE PRESENTATIONS HERE TODAY A LOT OF HELPFUL INFORMATION REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AS WELL COMING FROM AN URBANIZED NEIGHBORHOOD AS WELL WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT. DELTA ENVIRONMENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. HOW THAT- BOTH ACCESS TO EXISTING STATE PARKS AND ALSO FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES- BUT I ALSO HAVE THAT BLESSING OF BEING ABLE TO REPRESENT A BEAUTIFUL PART OF THE COAST LINE WITH A LOT OF GREAT STATE PARKS AND BEACHES. IN THE SEVEN EIGHT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND WE KNOW. ARE PARTICULARLY ACUTELY DOWN THERE HOW. USED ARE STATE PARKS FACILITIES ARE. ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE WELL AWARE OF THE IMPACTS THAT WERE FEARING UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO DIRECTOR CAN TERRA WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS DOING NOW- TO DETERMINE WHAT SEA LEVEL RISE MIGHT MEAN TO MANY OF OUR STATE PARKS AND THE FACILITIES THAT ARE THERE- ANY PLANS OF ACTIONS TO BE ABLE TO. ADOPT OR TO MITIGATE FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR MUCH FOR THAT. IS THAT MEMBERS TAKE PART IS JEFF. FINISHED A SEA LEVEL RISE ADAPTATIONS ADAPTATION STRATEGY. AND IT LAYS OUT A ROADMAP. TO BUILD A RAPPER NOW TO RESPONSE FOR SEA LEVEL RISE. OR THE COASTAL STATE PARK UNITS ALL ALONG THE COAST STATE PARKS ACTUALLY MANAGES OVER THREE HUNDRED MILES. OF THE COASTLINE OF CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE FOR ALL OF US. AND SOMEBODY IDENTIFIED ACTIONS ARE ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED FOR EXAMPLE. OR SOME OF THE- ACTIONS ARE ALREADY BEING IDENTIFIED AND WE'RE ALSO PRIORITY PRIORITIZING OTHERS AS WE WERE ABLE TO GET FUNDING. PARTNERSHIPS AND ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY- YOUR QUESTION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING IN OUR ADAPTATION STRATEGY IS LOOKING. TO WHAT KINDS OF ACTIONS DO WE NEED TO TAKE NOW IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A SEA LEVEL RISE OF SAY THREE FEET OVER THE NEXT FORTY YEARS. AND IT REALLY MAKES A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT WE IMPLEMENT- HOW WE MANAGE ACCESS AND HOW WE LOOK AT THE SAUDIS AND ALL OF THAT SO IT'S A- IT'S A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR US AND I WILL ALSO SAY. THAT WITH STATE PARKS WE'RE WORKING WITH ORIGINATION LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES WERE ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF WAR WE WORK WITH A GROUP CALLED CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE STEWARDSHIP NICHE. STEWARDSHIP NETWORK AND WHAT WE DO THERE IS WE WORK WITH PARTNERS SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST WORKING IN A POCKET IN ONE AREA WE'RE WORKING AS A COLLECTIVE. WITH OTHER LAND MANAGERS IN THE AREA BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO BE OPERATING. IN A WATERSHED SCALE IS WORKING FOR GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE EFFECTIVE DECISIONS AND EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS. INTO THESE PARTNERSHIPS I'VE SEEN. BASICALLY A FORCE MULTIPLIER OF KNOWLEDGE. OF RESOURCES IN TERMS OF PEOPLE AND FUNDING AND ALSO PROBLEMS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE. OR SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS AND HAVE A MUCH. BROADER. APPLICATION AND IMPACT. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- IF OUR DIRECTOR LAYERS WITH US WITHOUT AND WILD. I REALLY THOUGHT THE SAME THEREFORE THREE YEARS APART- WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR LANDS THAT MIGHT BE. AFFECTING WELL THAT MIGHT BE AT RISK FOR SEA LEVEL RISE- TO BE ABLE TO THICK AND MITIGATE OR ADAPT OUT FOR SOME OF THE WILDLIFE PROGRAMS- AND THOSE IMPACTS WE EXPECT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. THANK YOU. SUM OF MEMBER. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING THROUGH OUR PROPOSITION ONE PROP SIXTY EIGHT GRANT PROGRAMS TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE. ARE AREAS OF RESTORATION OR REMEDIATION. FOR THOSE POTENTIAL HABITAT THAT WOULD BE EITHER LOST OR ENTER DATED AS C. LEVEL RISE OCCURS. WE'RE ALSO WORKING AS DIRECTOR CAN TERO TALKED ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE- OUR- PARTNERSHIP- THE- ISSUE IS. ALL THIS WAS HIGH A LOT OF THESE- WILDLIFE AREAS OR ECOLOGICAL RESERVES ARE- DOWN BY URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM TO GO WHERE THE SEA LEVEL RISES AND WE CAN USE SOME OF THE IN LINE BECAUSE I MEAN THE COASTAL LAGOON HABITATS THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND BIODIVERSITY- WHAT HAPPENS AS THE SEA LEVEL RISE IS. AND INTIMIDATION OCCURS- UPWARD IN THE CHANNEL SO WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT STRATEGIC RESTORATION OR REMEDIATION PROJECTS WITHIN THE FOOTPRINT ALLOWED OR SEEK ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS BORDERING THOSE PROPERTIES TO ENSURE THAT THE HABITATS ARE MAINTAINED. AND I THINK THAT IT'S A IT'S A BIG LEFT- WORKING ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENCIES WHETHER IT'S THE COASTAL COMMISSION LOCAL PLANNING DEPARTMENTS STATE PARKS AND OTHER- FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES THAT MANAGE THOSE HABITATS SO IT'S BASICALLY EVERYBODY'S GOT A LEAD INTO THIS BECAUSE NO ONE ENTITY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND QUICK ENOUGH AND THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD MODELS OUT THERE AND THEN THE NATIONAL LANDSCAPE. HOW THE GULF COAST COMMUNITIES IN FLORIDA AND THE BARRIER ISLANDS ARE ADDRESSING HOW CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEA LEVEL RISE WILL AFFECT CENTRAL- CRITICAL WILDLIFE AND ECOLOGICAL HABITATS- NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE PLANET. THANK YOU AND I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID IT IS GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US ON VERY SENSITIVE AREAS LIKE THE TIJUANA RIVER ESTUARY IN MISSION BAY AND OTHER SPACES THAT EVEN AN URBANIZED ENVIRONMENT- PROVIDE GREAT RESOURCE FOR A LOT OF OUR- BOTH MIGRATORY AND- REALLY STAT TAKE A- FOUND SO- ONE OF. WITH YOU ON AND I WILL STAY IN TOUCH AND I'M SURE A LOT OF GONNA BE THERE AND AS A WORKING THE- OF BOND RELATED. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES. PROTESTED YOU SO MUCH. YOUR PARTICIPATION I HAVE ONE QUESTION I THINK ALL OF YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO. RESPOND TO IT AS WE CLOSE UP THIS A PANEL PRESENTATION. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER CHALLENGES THE PAST YEAR THE YOU DID NOT HAVE THE CHANCE TO SPEAK ON DURING YOUR TESTIMONY WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. HOW YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS AND PERSPECTIVES ON THAT MAYBE A MINUTE OR SO RESPONSE- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL THANK YOU. ON THIS SUBJECT IN BATTLE TO START VERY QUICKLY WHAT WE DID WITH THE PARKS AS WE LOOK. AT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE PARKS ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. BECAUSE EVERYONE IS STATED WE HAD TREMENDOUS INCREASES IN PUBLIC VISITATION APART. WELL WE HAD TO BE REALLY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE PROTECTING FOLKS FROM- ACTIVITIES IT COULD CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTAMINATION SO WE HAD TO DO THINGS LIKE REMOVE PICNIC TABLES AND WE MADE SURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE CAME TO PARKS. THEY WERE INFORMED WE SHOULD BE SIMPLY DISTANCE IS USUALLY THE PATIENT KEEP MOVING. AND WHAT WE DID IS WE USE ALL THE FORMS OF MEDIA TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT. ON OUT WHERE PEOPLE COULD GO WHAT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THEY COULD ENGAGE IN- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE DID IS WE TOOK. THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTIVE IN TERMS OF STAYING AT HOME. AND EMPLOYEES AND WE WORK WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE. THAT AS WE MAKE CHANGES RELATIVETO PUBLIC ACCESS. ON AND HOW WE MANAGE PUBLIC ACCESS TO PARKS WHAT IN LINE WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING COUNTYWIDE. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIP WITH CITY REGIONAL AND FEDERAL LAND AGENCIES WE ALL ENDED UP. BASICALLY MOVING IN CONCERT. AND I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT IT WAS. STATE PARKS LEADERS. BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY. WELL THE I CAME ON BOARD AS IT. AND ACTUALLY PUT THE- TOGETHER I HOPE HOW WE COULD MOVE FORWARD. IN BOTH AN ADAPTIVE MANNER AS WELL AS A COOPERATIVE MANNER WITH OTHER- PARK FARM PUBLIC. AGENCY NO BE THERE. THANK THANK YOU. AND I'D JUST LIKE- MISTER CHAIR STATE ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS- RECOGNIZED. AND I THINK IN OUR CURRENT BUDGET YEAR- APPROPRIATION AND ALSO IN THE GOVERNOR'S JAN TEN BUDGET. IS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO KEEP OUR OPEN SPACES OPEN AND ALSO MAKE THEM WELCOME. ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND WHAT WE FOUND IS. MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE DEPARTMENTS ARE BROAD LANDSCAPE- MENTORSHIP AND STEWARDSHIP RESPONSIBILITY. SO HOW DO WE PROVIDE APPROPRIATE SIGNAGE INFORMING THEM THAT IT'S OPEN AND WELCOME HELLO WE HAVE NATIVE AMERICAN AG KNOWLEDGE MEANT OF THAT LAND HOW DO WE DISCUSS THE VALUES OF THAT LAND IN TERMS THEN- APPROPRIATE- LANGUAGE THAT THEY CAN HELP UNDERSTAND WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO THEM. IN THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH SO WE ARE MOVING RAPIDLY INTO THAT SPACE APPROPRIATE SANITATION FACILITIES APPROPRIATE SIGNAGE AND APPROPRIATE ACCESS POINTS SO I THINK THAT THE- MEANING INTO IT AND KEEPING OPEN SPACES OPEN AND MAKING- WELCOME TO ALL MEMBERS CALIFORNIA IS ESSENTIAL AS WE MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I'LL PREDICT. IT MAY NOT BE CORONA VIRUS IN THE CODEPENDENT SOMETHING. ELSE WILL COME NEXT. THANK YOU THANK YOU DIRECTOR I. PLANO THAT- MY CALL AND I I'M SURE MANY OF OUR OTHER. COLLEAGUES HERE WE APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF NATIVE AMERICAN- IDENTIFICATION AT OUR STATE PARK SAID NESS ASIDE FROM KIND OF THE RESPECT THAT THE THAT IT THEY DESERVE IT IT'S ALSO EDUCATIONAL TO LET CALIFORNIANS AND OTHERS VISITING- OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE PARKS THE YOU KNOW THE TRADITIONAL PEOPLES. WHO WERE THERE PRIOR TO US AND THAT BECOMES THE PART THANK YOU- I LOVE ANOTHER AGAIN SAME QUESTION FOR THE OTHER TWO PALACE AND THEN WE'LL WRAP UP SO THAT WE CAN GET INTO THE NEXT- PANEL. OKAY CHECKERS YEAH I WOULD- I'D LIKE TO MENTION. THAT FOR US WE- I THINK I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHARM LEANING AND PARK AND RECREATION SECTOR UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REALLY NEEDS AND- TO PROVIDE SAFETY AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO. OUR COMMUNITIES AND REALLY PIVOTED IN VERY INNOVATIVE WAYS- IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE ARE ENGAGED AND ACTUALLY MEETING EVERY PARK AND RECREATION DIRECTOR IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. HAS BEEN MEETING ON A BI MONTHLY BASIS. I'M REALLY LOOKING AT INNOVATIVE WAYS TO SERVICING OUR DIRECTLY IN OUR- JOINTLY OUR CONSTITUENCIES. ALSO I DO WANT TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF JUST COLLABORATING. ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES AND THAT'S TO ME THAT'S A VERY STRONG ACCOUNTING SO AS PUBLIC HEALTH RESTRICTIONS I WOULD BE MODIFIED. IT WAS NOT ABOUT WHAT CAN NOT WE CAN'T DO BUT IT WAS MORE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. AND I WILL ALSO JUST WANT TO MENTION IN HIGHLIGHT THE THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF PARKING RECOGNITION. A RANGERS. PARK STAFF GROUNDS MAINTENANCE STAFF WHO LEGALLY LEGAL DAN. AND I THINK FOR ME THE LESSON LEARNED IS THAT WE NEED TO REALLY MARKET- THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT THIS CON- THIS PANDEMIC. WELL I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE. THE THAT THE CRITICAL VALUE OF OUR HEALTH WORKERS ARE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. BUT OUR PARK AND RECREATION TEAMS UP AND DOWN THE STATE HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES REALLY SUPPORTING THE WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITIES- AND I THINK THAT WE IN THE SAME WAY. NEED TO FURTHER- REALLY HIGHLIGHT- THIS WORKFORCE THAT IS BEEN GIVING CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ALL. OF THIS ENTIRE TIME DURING THE PANDEMIC. THANK SO MUCH TALK- WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE FINE WORD IN USE FOR. OF QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE ACTS TO THE BAR. BUT TO THE MEN BECAUSE- SPIRITUAL- ANDY AND A CALL THAT WE SEE- HAS BEEN SOLD NOT BOUGHT IF YOU WANT TO. KIND OF. FINAL WORDS FOR THE A PANEL. WHAT WILL IT FOR HIT WE ACTUALLY BENEFITED FROM THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WERE BUILT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS BETWEEN PARKS AND HEALTH- FOLKS IN THE BAY AREA WE HAVE BEEN MEETING UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF HEALTHY PARKS HEALTHY PEOPLE AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT- MANY PARK DISTRICTS AND LAND MANAGERS WERE REALLY RECEIVING MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT WHAT TO DO- AND SINCE WE STARTED MEETING FIRST ON A WEEKLY BASIS- AND THEN WE ACTUALLY ENDED UP PUTTING TOGETHER A SERIES OF THREE WEAPON ARTISTS WITH EPIDEMIOLOGIST. AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES PEOPLE GIVING INFORMATION TO PEOPLE IN PARKS BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED REALLY PEOPLE PARKS ARE VERY MUCH ON THE FRONT LINES OF DEALING WITH THE PANDEMIC AND- PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES WHICH WERE NOT HAPPENING IN A REGION WHERE WE'RE THROWING UP PARK MINISTRY- SOFT BECAUSE THEN THE POLICIES OF ONE COUNTY WOULD IMPACT- YOU KNOW IT WOULD LEAD PEOPLE TO ALL FLOCK TO ANOTHER COUNTY'S. IF BUT PARKS IN ONE DISTRICT WERE CLOSED AND SO WE REALLY TRY TO HELP CREATE CONSISTENT MESSAGING AND TO BE GENERALIZATION FROM THE HEALTH SIDE TO PARKS AND I THINK THAT THE U. INVITING ME TO THIS AND- MORE INTO YOU KNOW IF WE CAN DO THE SAME AND HAVE MORE INTO HER DISCIPLINARY- DISCUSSIONS WE REALLY WILL BE PREPARED FOR. THE NEXT PANDEMIC WHICH I AGREE IS COMING AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE- I THINK THAT PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE OUTDOORS AND PEOPLE THAT WORK IN PARKS ARE ARE ACTUALLY FACING VERY MUCH ARE VERY SIMILAR ISSUES AND WE ARE BOTH VERY IMPACTED BY INEQUITY BECAUSE INEQUITY DRIVES. A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE IN HEALTH AND I'M SURE THAT IT. DRIVES A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU SEE. I MEAN CAN FOR OUT PARKS WHY- AND- BUT I'D START THE WHOLE SO AND I'M- NH AS PART OF OPTIMA. WE HAVE A VACCINE WHICH IS LIKE UNBELIEVABLE WE SHOULD ALL BE REALLY CELEBRATING THAT IT'S A- GREAT THING- AND I HOPE THAT OUR DISCIPLINES CAN WORK TOGETHER TO. MAKE THE SUCCESS- ACCESSIBLE TO ALL- YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT ALL POPULATIONS CAN TRUST. AND THAT PARK FOLKS WHO ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO IT- AND SO I THINK REALLY FOR ME IT'S THE RELATIONSHIPS BUILT BETWEEN. THESE VERY DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES CARING FOR THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE ON THE PLANET- THAT WE QUOTE UNQUOTE LIED AND LEANED INTO AND THE TRUTH WE WILL NEED TO KEEP LEANING INTO TO BE PREPARED. FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU AGAIN DR AND ALL OF THE S. THE PALACE THIS MORNING WE WENT BACK OVER BUT GOOD INFORMATION IMPORTANT INFORMATION WE ASKED THE QUESTION WE WANTED TO KNOW AND I THINK IT WAS- WORKED UP. THE EXTENDED TIME THAT WE ADDED SO AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US WE WILL WE WILL GET BACK TO OUR DIRECTORS YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DIVERSITY. HIRING AS WE- YOU KNOW BEEF UP SERVICES AND INVESTMENTS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT AGAIN TODAY'S- FOCUS WAS THE ISSUE OF THE PANDEMIC- THE CURRENT STATUS OF OUR STATE PARKS AND OF COURSE THE STIRS ACCESS ISSUES. AT THAT- BEEN BROUGHT UP SO THANK YOU AGAIN WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT- PANEL AND THAT'S A FUNNY AN OVERVIEW AND IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE WE HAVE A PRIME BROWN FROM THE DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

OUR WEBSITE LA- AUTO DOT CA DOT GOV SO THAT'S- ANYONE CAN DOWNLOAD THAT WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW ALONG I'M IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- THE HEAD OF THE SELF IS. JUST SIX OR SEVEN PAGES BUT ALL ALL GO THROUGH PRETTY QUICKLY I WILL GO THROUGH PEOPLE LOOK WENT ON TO IS THE HIGHLIGHT. OF THE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END- IF THE- NUMBER OF PLEASURE SO I'M IF YOU TURN TO THE FIRST PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT WE DO HIGHLIGHT. SOME OF THE MAJOR FUNDING SOURCES FOR PARKS AND OPEN SPACE IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S OF COURSE. A VARIETY OF STATE FUNDING USED FOR BOTH. STATE PARK IN LOCAL PARKS- THERE'S STATE GENERAL FUND OR SPECIAL FUNDING OF COURSE GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND. ARE COMMONLY USED THERE'S A SIMILARLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE'S LOCAL TAX REVENUE- LOCAL BONDS AND ALSO LOCAL. A SPECIAL FUND REVENUES FROM VISITOR FEES. WE HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR PARKS RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT SPENT BY STATE AND LOCAL. FUNDS AND OF COURSE OUR NON PROFIT PARTNERS ALSO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND PARKS. TO SUPPORT THOSE ACTIVITIES. IF TURN TO PAGE TWO- PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE. IN DETAIL SPECIFICALLY ON STATE PROGRAMS AND SO OF COURSE OUR LARGEST PROGRAM FIRST PARKS AND OPEN SPACE IN CALIFORNIA AT THE STATE LEVEL. IS OUR STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT YOU HEARD FROM- THE DIRECTOR AT THE IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THE BUDGET PROVIDES ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT- YOU'LL SEE IN THE PIE CHART THAT. ROUGHLY HALF OF THAT IS FROM WHAT WE CONSIDER ONGOING. I'M SURE THIS IS SUCH IN GENERAL FIND IN STATE PARKS AND RECREATION FOR UNDER THE TWO LARGEST SOURCES. WE DO ALSO HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET FROM STATE BOND THAT'S PRIMARILY PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT WHICH ALL SPEAK TO IN JUST A MOMENT. AND THEN A SMALLER SHARE OF FEDERAL FUNDS IMPORTANTLY THE TOTAL FUNDING YOU SEE HERE THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION. ABOUT HALF OF THAT IS TO SUPPORT OUR STATE PARK SYSTEM- BOTH OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL PROJECTS AND THEN ABOUT HALF. IS FOR- GRANTS TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL PARKS AND MUCH OF THAT IS AGAIN FROM THE BOND FUNDING. IF YOU GO TO PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT DO WANNA HIGHLIGHT THAT OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO PARTS OF THE STATE. OTHER CLICK ACCESS- PROGRAMS- DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE YOU'VE YOU'VE HEARD FROM HAS OF COURSE IT'S HUNTING AND FISHING PROGRAM AS WELL AS AS A DEPUTY DIRECTOR MENTIONED THEY COULD MANAGE ONE POINT ONE MILLION ACRES OF THEIR OWN LANDS AS WELL AS YOU HAVE A LITTLE INFORMATION ON THOSE PROGRAMS THEY ARE THE FUNDING SOURCES FOR SUPPORT THOSE- AND THEN OF COURSE IN ADDITION WE HAVE. OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL WHEN I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU IS THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY HAS A RELATIVELY NEW PROGRAM IS JUST GETTING OFF THE GROUND NOW IT'S THE YOUTH COMMUNITY ACCESS GRANT PROGRAM THIS IS FUNDED BY A CANNABIS TAX REVENUES IN THIS PROVIDES. GRANTS TO LOCAL AGENCIES. RIGHT INCREASED ACTS FOR. UNDERSERVED AT RISK YOUTH TO- TO PUBLIC RECREATION ACTIVITIES. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE OUR TWELVE STATE CONSERVANCY THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD THAT DO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES. AND THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE- ACTUAL MANAGEMENT OF LAND AS WELL AS GRANTS TO. DIFFERENT AGENCIES INVOLVED IN- IN ACQUIRING OR CONSERVING PUBLIC LANDS. IF YOU TURN THE PAGE FOR ALL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT THIS WAS THE LEGISLATIVE BOND MEASURE GENERAL OBLIGATION. BOND THAT WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. YOU CAN SEE THE TABLE HERE THAT THE BOND PROVIDING TOTAL ABOUT FOUR POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT COVERED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NATURAL RESOURCES RELATED PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. AND IF WE LOOK THROUGH IT IT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION OF THAT IS SPECIFIC TO PARKS AND- PUBLIC LANDS ACQUISITION AND MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC LANDS AND YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE TABLE THAT THE SINGLE LARGEST SHARE OF THAT JUST OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A SPECIFIC TO IMPROVING. AND EXPANDING LOCAL PARKS AND OF THAT AMOUNT AT SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAS SPECIFICALLY TO- PROVIDE GRANTS TO PARK POOR COMMUNITIES AND YOU CAN SEE HERE TOO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMS SUPPORTING STATE PARK'S CONSERVANCY. AND OTHER PROGRAMS- IMPORTANTLY YOU'LL SEE IN THE TABLE TO THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. ROUGHLY 90% OF THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE- THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S BEEN SPENT YET BUT IT'S BEEN APPROPRIATED AND DEPARTMENTS ARE. HAVE EITHER AWARDED THAT FUNDING TO GRANT RECIPIENTS OR DEDICATED TO PROJECTS OR IN THE PROCESS OF DOING SO THAT A RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE OF THAT LEFT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE- I WILL GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE BULLET POINTS BUT I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE. THEY'RE WORTH ARE HAVE BEEN AND ARE SOME NOTABLE FISCAL PROPOSALS RELATED TO PARKS AND OPEN SPACE SO. IN THE CURRENT BUDGET THAT WAS ENACTED THIS PAST JUNE. WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN PARTICULAR EVEN EVEN YOU'LL RECALL AT THE TIME THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF CONCERN GIVEN THE PANDEMIC ABOUT THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION- DESPITE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND. APPROPRIATION PROVIDED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A STATE PARKS AND OTHER PROGRAMS SO IT% JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE ONE WAS THERE WAS QUITE A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT. POTENTIAL LOST REVENUES FOR STATE PARKS BECAUSE OF REDUCED VISITOR SHIP AN ACTIVITY- SO THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN BACK FILL ANY LOST REVENUES- I BELIEVE THE MOST RECENT UPDATE IS THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANTICIPATE WE WON'T NEED THE FULL ONE HUNDRED FIFTY IT MIGHT BE MORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY- ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT YET. FINAL IN ADDITION THE CURRENT BUDGET ALREADY ENACTED INCLUDED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT EIGHTY TWO OH NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER THE MOMENT- THIS IS GRANTS TO PROVIDE. UNDERSERVED YOUTH WITHOUT DOOR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES. AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- TO ESTABLISH A NEW STATE PARK- THAT LOCATION THAT PARK. AND NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED. I'M IN IT THE- GUY HAS FOR. A NUMBER NEW- FINDING FOR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES RELATED TO PARKS AND OPEN SPACE AND I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT ONE IN PARTICULAR- WHICH IS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S ONE BILLION DOLLAR WHILE FILER FIRE RESILIENCY PACKAGE. THAT'S IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE NOW THERE'S SIGNIFICANT FUNDING PROPOSED FOR FOREST HEALTH. ACTIVITIES TO- REDUCE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF LAW I'LL FIRED OWNERS ON OUR STATE LAND SO THAT INCLUDES. EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU SEE HERE IN THE HAND OUT SPECIFIC FOR STATE PARKS- BUT THERE'S ALSO FUNDING FOR SIMILAR ACTIVITIES. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE- ALSO STAYED ON THE LAND. AND OWNED BY THE- A STATE LANDS COMMISSION IN TALLINN CONSERVANCY IS WELL SO THAT'S A MAJOR NEW INVESTMENT I THINK A RECOGNITION THAT THE STATE HAS NOT INVESTED IN THOSE ACTIVITIES ADEQUATELY IN PAST YEARS. AND I'LL NOTE TO THAT- POURTANT FEDERAL LEGISLATION RECENTLY LAST YEAR THE FEDERAL CONGRESSMEN AND PRESIDENTS SIGNED- THE GREAT OUTDOORS ACT WHICH PROVIDES- SORT OF LOCKS IN A HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL PARKS THE ANTICIPATION I BELIEVE IS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL RE RECEIVE MAYBE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF AN ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN OR SO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. FROM THAT PROGRAM. LASTLY IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX OF THE HANDOUT JUST WANNA IDENTIFY SOME OF THE SORT OF FISCAL CHALLENGES THAT. CONFRONT THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU. CONSIDER THE DIFFERENT ISSUES DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN PROVIDING ADEQUATE PARKING OPEN SPACE- TO COMMUNITIES. THE FIRST IS THAT WE KNOW EVEN WITH OUR EXISTING LANDS- THAT. WE HAVE CHALLENGES MANAGING THEM THAT INCLUDES BOTH- FOR EXAMPLE STATE PARKS AND FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENTS HAVE UNDERGONE WITH THEY'VE REFERRED TO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING ANALYSES TO IDENTIFY DEFICIENCIES AND MEETING THEIR EXISTING OBLIGATIONS. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR EXAMPLE ON STATE FACILITIES. AND IN ADDITION YOU'VE HEARD SOME CONVERSATION ALREADY ABOUT INCREASING RISKS TO OUR EXISTING STATE LANDS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE WEATHER WILDFIRE SEALEVEL RISE OR OTHER. CHALLENGES BUT IN ADDITION TO THE CHALLENGES MANAGING OUR EXISTING FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE THERE ARE OF COURSE THE CHALLENGE HE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING ALREADY WHICH ARE THE CHALLENGES OF. THE EXISTING PARKS AND OPEN SPACES NOT NECESSARILY BEING SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE- CONCERNS THAT WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER ABOUT THE DISPROPORTIONATE ACCESS THAT DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES HAVE BASED ON GEOGRAPHY OR WEALTH OR OTHER FACTORS- AS WELL AS- CONCERN OR AN INTEREST IN EXPANDING. THE SHARE OF THE STATE LAND IN COASTAL WATERS THAT ARE. CONCERNED FOR THE FUTURE AND SO THAT. COURSE OF REFLECT IN THE GULF EXECUTIVE ORDER. TO INCREASE THOSE LANDS TO THIRTY PERCENT- BY TWENTY THIRTY. NOW WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE THINKING BOTH THE- ABOUT THE- INVESTMENTS TO BETTER PROTECT EXISTING LAN OR TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PUBLIC SPACE THERE ARE OF COURSE FISCAL CONSTRAINTS AND SO JUST TO IDENTIFY AS WE TALKED ABOUT- ON THE FIRST PAGE THE STATE FUNDING TYPICALLY COMES IN ONE OF THREE. FLAVORS EITHER GENERAL FIND STATE BOND FUNDS OR SPECIAL FUNDS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY FUNDED THROUGH FEE PAYERS ARE TAXPAYERS AND EACH ONE OF THOSE CAN BE USED TO YOU CAN LOOK AT OPTIONS TO EXPAND IN THE USE OF ANY OF THOSE FOR STATE AND LOCAL PARKS- BUT EACH COME WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF TRADE OFFS TO BE AWARE OF- GENERAL FUND OF COURSE- IS ALWAYS. SOMETHING THAT- ANY PROGRAM HAS TO ADJUST TO FIND HAVE TO COMPETE FOR ESSENTIALLY IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS INCORPORATING NOW- MOST RECENTLY BOTH OUR OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE PROJECTED THAT THERE COULD BE OUT YUR GENERAL FUND. DEFICIT AND SO THAT CREATES A CHALLENGE TO IDENTIFYING NEW FUNDING THAT CAN BE USED TO EXPAND PROGRAMS FROM THAT SOURCE- BOND FUNDS LIKE PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT- SOURCE THAT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY USED IN THE STATE TO SUPPORT- PARKS AND IN OTHER PROJECTS THE- PROBABLY THE MAIN THING TO JUST RECOGNIZE WITH BOND FUNDS AS THOSE ARE ONE TIME FUNDS. AND SO THAT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF FACILITIES BUT IS NOT REALLY THE BEST USE- OR OR THE BEST SOURCE. FOR ONGOING OPERATIONAL COSTS. IN IN LASTLY COURSE YOU CAN ALL LOOK AT ALL OF FOR. SPECIAL FOR REVENUES EITHER FROM FEEDS TAX- THE MAIN TRADE OFF TO BE AWARE THERE IS THOSE INCREASED REVENUES HAVE TO BE ASSESSED ON SOMEONE WHETHER THAT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE VISITING THE PARKS OR- OTHER SOURCES AND SO YOU IN. CONCERNING THOSE TYPES OF OPTIONS YOU ALWAYS GOING TO BE COGNIZANT OF WHO WOULD BE PAYING THOSE FEES IS IT EQUITABLE IN AUTUMN HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE USED- SO WITH THAT I AM. HAPPY AT THE END OF THE PANEL TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME MEMBERS THAT WILL BE GOING IN AND OUT GOING TO TAKE LIBERTY THAT. ALLOWS SOME OF THE MEMBERS TO MAYBE ASK YOU A QUESTION OR TWO BEFORE THEY HAVE TO CUT OUT. MEMBERS THANK YOU MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GERMAN GARCIA- MIGHT I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE OF THEM IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IT'S ON PAGE- IN FIVE. HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS THE FACT FIELD BECAUSE THE PARKS WERE ANTICIPATED TO HAVE LOWER REVENUE- AS A RESULT OF COVERT YET COVERT DROVE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE- TO GO OUTSIDE- COULD YOU DESCRIBE WHERE THE REVENUE LOSSES TOOK PLACE AND WHERE THE REVENUE GAINS TOOK PLACE IF MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE. FREE INDUCING OR OR OR FEE GENERATING- ASPECTS OF THE PARKS. YES I THINK IT'S A NUMBER IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S- SOMETHING THE PARKS DEPARTMENT PEOPLE SPEAK TOO WELL BUT I THINK THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT MOVING PIECES HERE THAT EXPLAINS THE INTEREST. RATE PART OF IT IS I MEAN SO I THINK- SOME OF THE- LADIES THE N. M. PARKS WERE CLOSED AND WE'RE WE'RE MORE CLOSED EARLIER IN THAT THIS PAST SPRING AND IN THE SUMMER AND- THAT'S OFTENTIMES SOME OF OUR HIGHEST REVENUE GENERATING PERIODS. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE LOST SOME REVENUE THERE PART OF IT TOO HAS TO DO WITH THE TYPES OF FACILITIES THAT WERE CLOSED SO- FOR EXAMPLE I THINK MANY OF OUR MUSEUMS ARE STILL CLOSED AND THOSE ARE REVENUE. SOURCES FOR US- THERE ARE ALSO- I THINK OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE HAD GENERATED LESS REVENUE DEPENDING ON- YOU KNOW RENTALS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN LASTLY I THINK IT IS ACCORDING TO THE CONVERSATION TO HAVE WITH THE FARM IS WHERE VISITORS SHIFT HAS HAPPENED THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT IN SO. AND NOT ALL NOT ALL PARTS CHANGED A CHARGE THE SAME VISITOR ACCESS FEES AND SO DEPENDING ON- WHERE PEOPLE ARE ACCESSING THEY MAY THEY MAY STILL BE VISITING IN GREATER NUMBERS BUT IF IT'S IN LOCATIONS THAT HAVE THAT GENERATE LESS REVENUE FROM- THE ACTUAL- FEASTED TO TOOK THE PARKING FEES OR THE ENTRANCE FEE. THAT COULD ACTUALLY DIMINISH THANK YOU MY OTHER QUESTION- FROM THERE THE REFERENCE TO THE GOVERNOR'S CALL AND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS- ESTABLISHED A GOAL OF PROTECTING 30% OF THE STATE'S LANDS BY TWENTY THIRTY- THAT'S IS THAT WHAT THAT REFERENCE OR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S. OVERALL PROPERTY PROTECTED. IN SOME WAY DO YOU. YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF IT. BEEN EXACT DEFINE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE INTENTION IS 430% OF THE STATE AND 30% OF COASTAL WATERS. TO BE- PROTECTED OR CONSERVANCY- WAY BUT WHAT WHAT PROTECTION CONCERT MEANS TO I THINK ALSO I HAVE NOT BEEN. FULLY DEFINED. SO WE DON'T HAVE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. ANY PROPOSALS TO SORT OF ENACT THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN WILL CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT PRESENTATION. AND THEN WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM OTHER MEMBERS. THANK YOU- CEDRIC MITCHELL BRETT W. DIRECTOR FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS THE WELCOME. THANK YOU SIR- MY NAME IS ANDREA MITCHELL I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AT CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS AND TODAY I WILL BE SPEAKING ON THE PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER HERE PARKS FIRST I'LL GIVE YOU A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODOLOGY UTILIZED FOR ENGAGING LOCAL STAFF STAKEHOLDERS FOR ALL OUR PROGRAMS I WILL THEN SHARE WITH YOU THE STATUS OF SAID PROGRAMS AND ANSWER IT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THAT YOU MAY HAVE. GENERALLY OUR APPROACH INCLUDES FOCUS GROUPS. PUBLIC HEARINGS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WORKSHOPS APPLICATION REVIEW AND AWARDS. WHAT'S MORE DO WE HAVE A DEDICATED TEAM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT AND TO ENSURE THE PROJECT REMAINS- AND PUBLICLY USED DURING THE DURATION OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. TO ENSURE ACCESS BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WE IMPLEMENTED A ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AIMED AT SIMPLIFYING PROCESS SEES. UPGRADING COMPUTER TOOLS TO ENHANCE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND INSTITUTED AN ONLINE APPLICATION SUBMITTAL PROCESS. AIMED AT STREAMLINING AND SEAMLESSLY PROVIDING APPLICANTS WITH ACCESS TO TOOLS THEY NEED TO. HAVE IN ORDER TO SUBMIT A COMPETITIVE APPLICATION. CORE TO OUR PROGRAM IS A COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE RESIDENTS ACCESS TO PLANNING PROCESSES AND TO REWARD APPLICANTS MUST SUBMIT PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE TRANSFORMATIVE FOR THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. WE DEVELOPED A PANDEMIC GUIDELINES THAT VALUE VIRTUAL CONNECTIVITY EQUALLY WITH IN PERSON ENGAGEMENT. OUR COMMITMENT TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HAS INCREASED USING VIRTUAL WORKSHOPS ONE ON ONE ACCESS JUST TO NAME A FEW. EMAIL AND PHONE CALLS OF A CERTAINLY A PART OF THAT AND SPECIFIC PROJECT OFFICERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR EVERY REGION WITHIN THE STATE. ALL COMPETITIVE WORKSHOPS HAVE BEEN RECORDED AND HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE ON THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR BASIS. THE RECORD SESSIONS HAVE BEEN SEGMENTED AND CONTENTS TO ALLOW APPLICANTS TO SELECT THEIR AREAS OF INTEREST AND THE VIEW AND LISTEN TO RECORDINGS IN ONE TO TEN MINUTE SEGMENTS. DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE- PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. A COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE STATEWIDE PARK AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT REVITALIZATION PROGRAM. AS DIRECTOR INTERMENT MENTIONED WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WILL BE- AWARDED THIS YEAR. THE APPLICATIONS FOR THAT PROGRAM ARE ACTUALLY DUE ON MARCH TWELFTH. AT ELEVEN FIFTY NINE SO JUST A REMINDER TO ALL OF YOU OUT THERE MARCH TWELFTH AT ELEVEN FIFTY NINE. THE STATE MY PART PROGRAM APPLICATIONS WILL BE DUE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE'LL BE MAKING AWARDS IN SEPTEMBER OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS PROGRAM. IT BASICALLY PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY CREATE NEW PARKS AND RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES AND CRITICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. INCLUDES NEW PARKS EXPANSION OF EXISTING PARKS FOR THE REHABILITATION OF EXISTING PARKS. THERE'S A THERE'S A MAXIMUM GRANT UP EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE MINIMUM REQUEST OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE IS NO MATCH REQUIREMENT FOR THIS. THIS PROGRAM IS ONE THAT'S- HIGHLY SUBSCRIBED NORMALLY WE RECEIVE ABOUT- ONE OUT OF EVERY TEN APPLICATIONS WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO FIND. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA HISTORICALLY LAST ROUND WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT APPLICATIONS. ASKING FOR OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS- WE HAD- OF THOSE FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT APPLICATIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHAT'S QUARTER PROGRAM IS COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. OTHER FOREIGN SEVENTY EIGHT APPLICATIONS OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND OUR- OUR MOST UNDERSERVED PARKOUR COMMUNITIES PARTICIPATED IN THE PLANNING AND DESIGN OF THOSE APPLICATIONS. THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE- CERTAINLY- OUR PARTICIPATION IS HOW WE DEVELOP APPLICATIONS AND PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE TRANSFORMATIVE FOR THE COMMUNITY CENTER THERE. OUR CURRENT ROUND AS I SAID WITH THE MARCH TWELFTH DEADLINE- WE'VE CONDUCTED- TEN APPLICATION WORKSHOPS IN JULY AND AUGUST ATTENDED BY OVER A THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS. NOW WE'RE CURRENTLY AVERAGING ABOUT FORTY QUESTIONS PER DAY REGARDING THIS PROGRAM SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT WOULD BE HIGHLY SUBSCRIBED ONCE AGAIN. AGAIN THIS PROGRAM CREATES NEW PARKS AND RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES IN UNDERSERVED AREAS SPECIFICALLY. HI IT HAS A HISTORY OF BEING EXTREMELY- SUBSCRIBE TO AND- WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS YEAR THAT WE WILL BASED ON- THE FEEDBACK WE WERE GETTING OUR HAVE AT LEAST A SEVERAL HUNDRED APPLICATIONS ARE LIKELY TO COME IN. FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE REAL RECREATION TOURISM PROGRAM. WE HAVE A NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH DEADLINE FOR THE APPLICATION WHEN TO SPEAK BETTER WORDS WILL BE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. OUR WORKSHOPS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND- THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW FOR THOSE APPLICATIONS. AND SHOULD YOU NOT BE X. COMPETITIVE IN THE STATE BY PARK PROGRAM TO STILL APPLY FOR PROGRAMS IN. THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM. WE HAVE TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE AND ESSENTIALLY ESSENTIALLY THE PROGRAM CREATES AND EXPANDS ROLE RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES- THE HEALTH. AND COMMUNITIES OF THE TOWNS AND THE TOWNS VISITORS. THE REGIONAL PARK PROGRAM ALSO HAS A NOVEMBER FIFTH DEADLINE. OUR FOCUS GROUPS AND PUBLIC HEARINGS AND GUIDELINE APPLICATIONS HAVE ALL BEEN COMPLETED THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE REGIONAL PARKS AGAIN THIS TIMING WILL ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR GRANTS A MISTAKE BY PART PROGRAM. IF THEY'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN GAINING A COMPETITIVE APPLICATION THEY CAN'T COMPETE- FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM ALSO. OUR PER CAPITA PROGRAM IS A NON COMPETITIVE PROGRAM WE HAVE A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE THOSE ALLOCATIONS HAVE BEEN- ANNOUNCED ON MINIMUM ALLOCATIONS FOR COUNTIES AND DISTRICTS IS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE MINIMUM ALLOCATIONS FOR CITIES- IS A ENTERED INTO OVER SEVEN HUNDRED CONTRACTS. WITH LOCAL PROVIDERS THOSE CONTRACTS IN OUR CASE ALLOW FOR US TO CELEBRATE A ESSENTIALLY RESET UPDATE- ACCOUNT WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS. AND THEN THEY WILL SUBMIT APPLICATIONS TO US FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS AND WE WILL ASSIST HIM ON FROM THE BEGINNING OF THAT PROJECT THROUGH THROUGH THE- COMPLETION.% THE COMMERCE DEADLINE FOR THOSE PROJECTS WILL BE JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE LIQUIDATION IS JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. YOUR MENTALITY- CAPITAL PROGRAMS A SUB PROGRAM WITHIN THE PER CAPITA PROGRAM. CITIES AND DISTRICTS AND URBANIZED COUNTIES WHERE THERE IS A POPULATION OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND- IN THE COUNTY IN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR LESS IN POPULATION ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM- THE FINES. ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE- AND- IT'S BASED ON THE ALLEGATIONS ARE BASED ON THE AVAILABLE FUNDS IN THE CAR. RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND REVENUE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BUT THAT CHANGED VOTER APPROVAL FOR- EIGHT REVENUE ENHANCEMENT MANAGER. BETWEEN NOVEMBER FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN- AND NOVEMBER THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. REVENUE ENHANCEMENT MEASURES ESSENTIALLY ARE FEES OR TAXES BUT THE SPECIFIC TO PARKS AND RECREATION- AND DID NOT INCLUDE OMNIBUS BILLS OR UNDER THIS- TAX TEXAS DEMOCRATS. WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. YES ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE IN LINE TO BE ALLOCATED FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT WE HAVE- WE HAVE AGAIN MAINTAINED A REQUIREMENT OF THE PUBLIC BE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS SEES. BECAUSE THE PROJECTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE- THAT WILL BE A WARNING WILL BE LONG LIVED IN THE COMMUNITY CENTER THERE. AT THIS TIME ALL STOP FROM THOSE OF THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT PROGRAMS AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALLOW FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU THE DIRECTOR WE DEFINITELY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS I'LL GO TO MY RIGHT- SOME MEMBER RUBIO AND WORK MY WAY BACK THIS WAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT- SO I HAVE QUESTIONS YOU SAID THAT YOU RECEIVED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT APPLICATIONS OF THOSE HOW MANY QUALIFIED IN. I ALSO HOW MANY WERE REJECTED FOR TECHNICALITIES WE HAVE- LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY CAN'T AFFORD A CONSULTANT TO PREPARE THEIR APPLICATIONS SO- THAT'S ALSO AN INTERESTING- DATA THAT I THINK IS RELEVANT BECAUSE IF SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES CAN'T- FILE THE APPLICATION OR THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND- AND ORDER BEING REJECTED FOR TECHNICALITIES ON THE APPLICATIONS NOT NECESSARILY. BECAUSE OF THEIR PROJECTS THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE REPRESENT THOSE SMALLER COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT NEED MORE ASSISTANCE YOU KNOW AND I LOVE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING FORTY QUESTIONS FOR PER DAY THAT YOU'RE DOING ALL THESE WORKSHOPS. BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO APPLY SOLD AGAIN THE QUESTION IS- HOW MANY QUALIFIED OF THE FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT AND NUMBER TWO HOW MANY WERE REJECTED FOR TECHNICALITIES NOT FOR. PROJECTS- CERTAINLY SOME OF THE FOURTEEN SEVENTY APPLICATIONS ALL WERE WERE ELIGIBLE AND THEY- WERE- IF YOU REJECTED ON ANY TECHNICALITIES. IT'S OUR POLICY THAT WE NOT REJECT APPLICATIONS BASED ON TECHNICALITY IN FACT. ONCE WE RECEIVE THE APPLICATIONS WHAT WE DO. IS THAT THEY ARE MISSING ITEMS WE CONTACT THE AGENCIES AND GIVE THEM AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME TO- TO PROVIDE THAT. EQUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS TO ENSURE THAT APPLICATIONS ARE APPLICANTS ARE ABLE TO PUT IN A QUALIFIED APPLICATION. WE HAVE A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS IN THIS CASE FOR THIS YEAR WE HAD TEN. IN THE PAST WE HAD- AN ADDITIONAL- SIXTEEN- BUT WHAT WE DO AT THOSE APPLICATION WORKSHOPS AS WE GO THROUGH PAGE BY PAGE. I'M ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE. WEEKLY TO FIND WHAT IS NEEDED. AND THEN WE PROVIDE A PROJECT OFFICER THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO. BUT THEY CAN CONTACT THROUGHOUT THE APPLICATION PROCESS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED. IN THIS CASE FOR THIS ROUND. WE HAD A NINE MONTH PROCESS NORMALLY AT SIX MONTHS. BUT BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF COVERAGE. WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE APPLICANTS. THE TOWN THEY NEED IN ORDER TO CONTACT AND ENGAGE THE PUBLIC. INPUT IN THE PLANNING PROCESS. SO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- WE DON'T DISQUALIFY FOR TECHNICAL REASONS OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT COMMUNITIES ARE SIR WE RECOGNIZE THAT- COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SOPHISTICATION AND PUTTING IN APPLICATIONS SO WE WILL LOOK AT THE APPLICATION FOR THEM. AS THE DESERT AS YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD- WE DON'T REQUIRE THAT ALL OF THE APPLICATION BE COMPLETED AT THE TIME OF SUBMITTAL GOTTEN SUCH A SEQUEL- THINGS SUCH AS- MEETINGS BY. BE A OFFICIALS ARE ELECTED BOARDS- WE ALLOW FOR THOSE BILLS TO COME IN LATER. SO THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO DISQUALIFY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE PROJECTS AND CERTAIN PEOPLE THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY THAT WE CAN. SO UNLIKE OTHER PROJECTS OR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU MAY BE AWARE OF. WELL WE DON'T REQUIRE LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT WE REQUIRE IS COMMUNITY ENGAGE PROCESS. THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO SEE. WHERE THE PUBLIC IS GOING IN AND THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PARTICULAR PROJECT. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU YES IT DOES- BUT I BELIEVE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A BREAKDOWN OF THOSE APPLICATIONS THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE TOO DETAILED BY YOU KNOW I'M SURE YOU HAVE A BREAK DOWN THAT THE COMMITTEE COULD. COULD LOOK OVER LIKE I SAID MY CONCERN AND I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION AND I COMMEND YOU FOR A LOT OF WORK THAT YOU DO HOWEVER IF WE CAN GIVE US A BREAK DOWN OF THE APPLICATION SO THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW SEE AND PERHAPS- WERE ABLE TO HELP IN OTHER AREAS- BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT YOU GUYS ARE PUTTING INTO MAKING SURE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES QUALIFY FOR THESE APPS FOR IT FOR THESE THESE FUNDS THANK YOU. OR WHAT LET'S PROVIDE REGION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR SURE- MR MITCHELL THANK YOU FOR THE- PRESENTATION. AND I AM THINKING OF THE FOLLOW UP KIND OF. ON THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS GOOD TO HEAR THAT YOU HELP BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THAT I GUESS I DON'T CALL IT SUCCESS BIAS ONCE. YOU HAVE CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL THEY TEND TO- HAVE GREATER SUCCESS THAN THOSE THAT HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY- MORE CHALLENGES SPECIAL INCOME TO COMPETITIVE GRANTS. SO EVEN IF. THEN SCENARIOS YOU'RE MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS THEIR- THE PROPER APPLICATION PUT IN PLACE. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO PUT A COMPETITIVE GRANT OUT THERE. AND. HI FOLKS APPLY BUT IS THERE ANY. I MEETING WITH WITH INTEREST. ARE EITHER KNOW% HOW WE- YOU I GO ABOUT IT BUT- TO BE PROACTIVE IN IDENTIFYING- AREAS THAT THAT ARE PART DOES THEIRS OR MAY NEED ASSISTANCE AND MAYBE THERE HASN'T BEEN- NECESSARILY. OF A GRANT APPLICATION BUT IS THERE A PROCESS WHERE EVEN WE COULD. YOU KNOW HELP OUR CITIES DO IT OUR COUNTIES DO IT OUR PARTS DEPARTMENTS WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE BUT- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE- SOMETIMES. IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BARRIERS MEAN THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT COST AN EARLIER PANEL- BUT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET SOME OF THESE- PARTICULAR PROJECTS APPROVED BUT- I'M- BEYOND THAT IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION. PROCESS I'D I'D REFERRED EARLIER TO THE FACT OF YOU KNOW BEING IN A HIGH COST OF LIVING AREA. HI PROPERTY VALUE AREA IT SEEMS A SOMETIMES DISADVANTAGE SOME OF- OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN MY DISTRICT. THAT AREN'T THAT DO HAVE PARKED OFFICES BUT BECAUSE- OF THE EQUATIONS AND CALCULATIONS USED. IT'S SOMETIMES HARD AGAINST AND THEY HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A HIGH CLASS LIVING AREA- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. IS YOU CAN OR HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR A CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR. GOING FORWARD I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET TO THAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY WHEN YOU HAVE. A STATEWIDE PROGRAM BUT IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THAT SO THAT WE GET THE REAL. THE REAL TIME NEED. OF THE FAMILIES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. CERTAINLY I'M AND THAT'S IT YOU BRING IT BACK POINT- OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS WE DEVELOPED ANY COMMITTEE FACTFINDER IS A TOOL THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO IDENTIFY- TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OUR PRODUCTS ARE AND WHERE THEY'RE NOT- WE ALSO HAVE TOOLS THAT ALLOW FOR US TO IDENTIFY- MAP OUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHERE THOSE THOSE THOSE PARK OUR DEFICITS ARE. EQUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO MR ARBITRATION PROCESS WHICH WE PROVIDE- WHICH IN THE CASE OF STATEWIDE PART PROGRAM INVOLVED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE ENGAGED ON IT AND POUNDING ON THE ON THE- GUIDELINES BUT IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE OUR CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES TOWARD IDENTIFYING WHICH REALLY. NEEDS SPACES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I FILE INCOME IS A QUALIFYING ACT AND CARPARK ACREAGE IS A QUALIFIER. OUR APPLICATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO LAST FOR YOUR STORE TO BE TOLD AND TO BE TOLD THROUGH THE EYES. AND EARS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING THERE. SO SO UNLIKE MANY PROGRAMS WE DO ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE DETAILS AND MOVE DOWN TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL. THE COMPUTER TOOLS HAVE HELPED US TO DO THAT IT HELPS ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD NORMALLY WOULD TAKE DAYS IF NOT WEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH. MUCH IN SECONDS IDENTIFYING WHERE THOSE THOSE- DEFICITS REALLY PART. ON WHETHER IT'S IN SAN JOSE OR WHETHER IT'S IN LOS ANGELES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THEY RANGE FROM THE SMALL COMMUNITIES OF AMERICA. TO DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WELL THEY RANGE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE- FOR THE MOST PART OF OUR STATE. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE COMPLETE APPLICATION PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH. WE ALSO DON'T JUST PLAY PAPER REVIEWS WE GET OUTLOOK TO THE COMMUNITIES. WE SEE THE PROJECT SITES WE MEET WITH PARKS AND THEN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS ARE REALLY GOING TO BE- SO IT'S NOT JUST A PAPER REVIEW. IT'S GETTING A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS AND THE STATE'S NAMES AND DIVERSITY. OF OUR STATE AND WHAT NEEDS TO OCCUR. THEY PROCESS THE WE DID A LITTLE AT OR SO. HAS REALLY GREAT IT'S BILL TO- AND EVEN SOME- I DID SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE BASED UPON. YEARS OF TRIAL AND ERROR. AND WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM SEMI PART PROGRAM PARTICULAR WHAT WE SEE IS WE SEE. THE ABILITY- TO ACTUALLY- COURAGE- ENCOURAGED ME THE NEIGHBORHOOD YES OUR NEIGHBORHOOD- COMMUNICATION TO TAKE PLACE SO I WE PRODUCED A DOCUMENT IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE IT'S PLANNING- PART PLANNING AND DESIGN THROUGH THE USE OF COMMUNITY AND THAT'S THE ONE IN WHICH- HAS BEEN APPROVALS BASED ON OVER TWELVE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS IN ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE SO WE HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. WHAT WE'RE ALSO FINDING IS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO FIND THOSE POCKETS IN URBAN AREAS AS WELL AS IN. OTHER RURAL COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. AND IT'S ABOUT A GOOD PROCESS NOT JUST LOOKING AT ONE IN PARTICULAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT LOOK FORWARD TO THE- DOING A DEEPER DIVE AS TO THE PROCESS BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE DEFINITELY TAKING THESE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT AND THERE'S NOT THERE'S NEVER A PERFECT PROCESS BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP ON BECAUSE IMPROVING AS WE LEARN MORE MORE SO. THANK YOU. A DIRECTOR- MITCHELL THANK YOU SO MUCH- YOU BOMB. DEFINITELY BEEN- PROVIDING SOME GOOD INFORMATION- ALONG THE WAY FOR THOSE WHO ARE APPLYING. FOR THESE GRANTS I KNOW FIRSTHAND MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES IN OUR DISTRICT. HAVE HAD A GOOD- OPEN- COMMUNICATION WITH WITH YOU IN THE AGENCY. PRIOR TO APPLYING AND EVEN AFTER APPLYING I I'VE ALWAYS ENCOURAGED THE CITY'S APPLICANTS TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE STATE. THE STATE AGENCY AND GET THE FEEDBACK AT THE HONEST FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF WHERE THE APPLICATION PUBLICATION. FOR PURPOSES OF YOU KNOW SHARPENING YOUR PENCIL AND MAKING SURE THAT THE NEXT ROUND IS MORE COMPETITIVE FOR THEM AND YOU IF YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE THAT YOUR TEAM IS ALWAYS ON THAT I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THAT I KNOW. THEY'RE STILL QUESTIONS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAD AND YOU'VE ANSWERED THAT IN TERMS OF THE PER CAPITA FUNDING FUNDING THAT EVERY CITY AND COUNTY JUST AUTOMATICALLY GETS FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT. THERE ARE MANY- AGENCIES THAT ARE STILL UNAWARE OF THAT FUNDING YOU MENTIONED COUNTIES FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CITIES A HUNDRED SEVEN SEVEN THOUSAND. THAT THAT'S A SHADE STRUCTURE OVER PLAYGROUND THAT'S A WATER FEATURE IN A HOT AREA OF THE STATE THAT'S A- PERHAPS EVEN FABRICATED NEW RESTROOMS I MEAN THAT THAT'S MONEY THAT CAN GO A LONG WAY. WHAT ARE THE- COMMUNICATIONS WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AS- FOR INFORMING THE CITIES AND COUNTIES- IT'S LIKE A YOU HAVE SOME MONEY RIGHT HERE YOU JUST NEED TO SUBMIT A PROJECT- WE'RE GONNA REVIEW IT. AND TELL YOU YEA OR NAY OR MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS OR WHAT WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE AGENCIES KNOW THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITIES EVEN IN OUR DISTRICT THAT ARE STILL. IN THE- GONNA NOT KNOWING- PHASE. OF HOW TO ACCESS THESE DOLLARS. CERTAIN WE'VE BEEN NOTIFIED EVERY AGENCY THAT THAT'S QUALIFIED FOR THE GRANT FUNDS- WE'VE ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS WITH MOST OF THEM- IF NOT ALL OF THEM AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT- SOME OF THE COMMUNICATION MAY BE INTERNAL AND THAT- IT JUST NOT AWARE THAT THE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE BUT THEY HAVE- BUT EVERY INSTITUTION EVERY AND EVERY- JURISDICTION HAS BEEN NOTIFIED AND WE HAVE HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH A PROJECTOFFICER- TO THAT JURISDICTION SO- WE WOULD BE GLAD TO TALK TO WHOMEVER YOU YOU'VE- COME ACROSS THAT ARE NOT AWARE THAT THE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED OR- ALLOCATED TO THEIR JURISDICTIONS. BUT BUT TYPICALLY WE HAVE MADE PERSONAL CONTACT AS WELL AS- WRITTEN CONTACT AND WE ALSO HAD A MANDATORY WORKSHOPS WHICH WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY OVER EIGHT HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS- GOING OVER ALL THE MONEY CAN BE SPENT ON THE PROCESS FOR SECURING IT- THEIR ALLOCATIONS ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE LAST. WEEKS AND- SO IT'S SURPRISING TO ME THAT IF THEY'RE NOT AWARE- BUT IT IS OUT THERE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK TO THE MEMBER- WE KEEP USING IT YES SIR ONE THING WILL DO AND WE HAVE EVERY EVERY THREE TO SIX MONTHS WE HAVE AGENCY REVIEWS AND WE REMIND FOLKS OF ALL THE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE WE SEEK OUT THE STATUS OF PROJECTS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD SO- SOMETIMES THERE'S A CHANGEOVER IN STAFF AND PERHAPS THAT DIDN'T GET COMMUNICATED BUT WE- STAND PERSONAL CONTACT WITH. EACH OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO ENSURE THE THING THAT. THEY DID NOT LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE. SO WE'RE GONNA CARRY JOB ALL A OF MIKE- KIND OF PUT OUT A NOTICE IN THERE COME AND- FOR THOSE COMING THAT ARE NOT AWARE THAT- THEY BE CONTACTING YOU. AND OR VICE VERSA- BECAUSE THAT'S MONEY THAT AS YOU SAID IS ON THE TABLE AND IF THOSE CONTRACTS AREN'T. ALREADY IN PLACE WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN GET THAT MONEY OUT- I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT D. DEFICIENCIES- FUNDING. AS IT RELATES TO A. B. R. THIRTY ONE CRITERIA THAT ARE USED FOR DISHING OUT SOME OF THESE DOLLARS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. HE TALKED TO US ABOUT YOU KNOW PROJECTS THAT YOU'VE SEEN THAT PERHAPS- COULD USE OR REQUIRE. ADDITIONAL I DON'T KNOW LEGISLATIVE- CRITERIA MODIFICATIONS WE HEARD SOME SUGGESTIONS EARLIER TO BE- THAT MUCH MORE INTENTIONAL WHEN IT COMES TO- GETTING DOLLARS TO- POR PART COMMUNITIES THAT MAY FIND THEMSELVES IN. REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT THE- THE SOCIO ECONOMICS ARE ARE NOT. IN LINE WITH THE POOR PARK COMMUNITY CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR OPINIONS ON HOW THAT- GREAT YEARS BEEN WORKING AS RELATES TO THE A. B. THIRTY ONE. OUR STATE PARK PROGRAM. WELL THIS AS A. B. THIRTY ONE'S CONCERN AND THAT AND THE WAY IN WHICH WE- ARE ENGAGING- WE'VE SEEN OUR PROJECTS COME FROM VERY RURAL COMMUNITIES LIKE EARLY MARCH AND CENTRAL VALLEY. TO TO PROJECTS IN CORNING AND STOPPED AND THE NORTH VALLEY TO PROGRESS IN CALEXICO I MEAN THERE IS A- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A- POINT OF CONTACT.

GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH JERRY GARCIA IT'S MY GREAT PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY AND ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ALL THIS IS JUST AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY HARD TO FOLLOW THE MONEY GUYS YOU KNOW AND- APPRECIATE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT CEDRIC AND STAFF. I WAS ABLE TO SHARE ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITIES IT WE ALL HAVE WITH EXISTING IN STATE FUNDS ARE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS EQUITY NEEDS FOR PARKS I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ARE REGARDING THE TREMENDOUS NEED THAT THERE IS OUT THERE FOR PARKS AND- I JUST OBVIOUSLY WITH CODED WE'VE SEEN THAT DON'T REALLY ASSUME IN QUITE A BIT MORE IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT NEED IS AND FRANKLY WHAT I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE- PEOPLE OF COLOR IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED FROM DISINVESTMENT AND CHALLENGES FOR DECADES ALL THE TIME FRANKLY BEEN KIND OF THE BACKBONE OF SUPPORTING. EFFORTS TO PASS BONDS FOR THE LAST TWO TO THREE DECADES AND YET HAVE NOT SEEN THOSEFUNDS BE INVESTED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES- MAYBE YOU KNOW IT'S IMPROVING A LITTLE BIT I THINK IN THE LAST TEN YEARS- DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE- SOME GREAT ELECTED MEMBERS. IN THE ASSEMBLY AND AT OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THAT RECOGNIZE THESE ISSUES AND ARE PROVIDING FOR VEHICLES TO INVEST IN IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- THAT HAVE THESE CHALLENGES- BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM WHERE- I'VE DONE THIS WORK FOR YOU KNOW OVER FORTY YEARS SAID BECAUSE I'M OLD. AND I DON'T GIVE UP AND I THINK THAT THE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ORGANIZATIONS STATEWIDE- THAT ARE VERY COMMITTED TO THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH COMMUNITY FOR A LONG TIME TO. MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY THEY HAVE ACCESS TO LOCAL PARKS BUT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PUBLIC LANDS AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON TODAY IS THE ISSUE OF THOSE ACCESS PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I SEE COMING UP. SO. I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH A QUICK LITTLE- SLIDESHOW HERE THAT I HOPE. ALL IS NOT GONNA BE DESTROY. BY THE IT'LL HELP US KEEP ON- EARLIER WE- A LITTLE. SIMPLE ABOUT PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF YOU KNOW WHY THEY NEEDED ACCESS TO NATURAL LANDS. I'LL JUST SHARE THIS REALLY QUICK QUOTE THAT. WAS PICKED UP ACTUALLY- IN THE PRESS LAST WEEK- AND IT'S FROM ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY LEADERS- A VOLUNTEER WITH NATURE FOR ALL. WHO MEET ANGLES LHASA WHO SAID WHEN FAMILIES VISIT THE SAME GABLE MOUNTAINS THEY TRANSFORM. BECOMING MORE RELAXED AND EXCITED TO EXPLORE AND EXPERIENCE NATURE. IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THIS NATURAL RESOURCE FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND FUTURE GENERATIONS TO ENJOY. AND THAT TO ME SAYS IT ALL RIGHT AND IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT NORMALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PUBLIC LANDS- THAT THEY HAVE LIKELY VOTED TO PROTECT. I'LL GET THAT OPPORTUNITY- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT NATURE FOR ALL WORKS ON HE IS- JUST A BASELINE POLICY OBJECTIVES THAT WE HAVE. EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ALL THOSE BENEFITS. ARE THE NATURE CAN PROVIDE AND I HAVE TO GIVE A BIG SHOUT OUT TO TWO OF MY STAFF MEMBERS OR OR A VERY SMALL A LOCAL NONPROFIT- BUT I HAVE BRAND MATSUMOTO WHO IS OUR PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE SAME PEOPLE MOUNTAINS. OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM WHO IS JUST DOING A BANG UP JOB. AND A STEADY AT NANDO'S WHO- IS OUR COMMUNITY TRANSIT SENIOR ORGANIZER. AND THEY HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE AND- WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. BETTER SERVICES TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. OUR ORGANIZATION WORKS ON PROTECTING PUBLIC LANDS CREATING MORE NATURAL OPEN SPACES AND- ALL THE SUBJECT MATTER TODAY CONNECTING PEOPLE. TO- TO PUBLIC LANDS. WE WERE. WHEN NO WERE JUST TO ON THIS- WITH. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT CAME ABOUT IN PARTICULAR IN LA COUNTY RELATED TO OUR MEASURE M. WHICH PROVIDED A FUNDING RESOURCE FOR TRANSIT OUR PROGRAMS. ON MEASURE A WHICH NORMATIVE AND SO ELOQUENTLY- AND THEN W. WHICH IS EIGHTY EIGHT FUNDING MEASURE UP FOR SAFE CLEAN WATER. THAT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY LEVERAGE IT AND AGAIN WAS VERY FORTUNATE HERE IN LA COUNTY THAT WE HAVE ELECTRIC OVER THE COURSE OF. A VOTE TWO VOTES- THAT PASSED MEASURES THAT ARE GENERATING ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS JUST A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY ON TOP OF YOU KNOW WHAT. IS AVAILABLE AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND WHAT WE WANNA DO IS MAXIMIZE THOSE INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY LEVERAGING OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE MOST AT DISADVANTAGE. ALL WE RECOGNIZE AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE ACCESS PROGRAMS WE HAD TO HAVE A PLAN. FOR HOW WE COULD ACHIEVE THAT THAT HAD SOM LEGITIMACY- SO WE REALLY WORKED HARD ON A ON A POLICY LEVEL. I HAD TO HAVE THE METRO BOARD FOR LOS ANGELES YOU ARE THE LESS INTEREST REGION OF THE COUNTY IT'S GREATER THAN THAT- TO BASICALLY DEVELOP A PLAN. THAT WOULD PROVIDE A BLUEPRINT FOR HOW YOU COULD PROVIDE A BETTER ACCESS TO OPEN SPACE AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT. UP MAJOR FOR ALL THE COMMUNITY NATURE CONNECTION ANOTHER ALL LONG TIME ORGANIZATION HERE IN THE LA AREA THAT HAS PROVIDED ACCESS TO- TO PARKS. WORKED ON THIS PLAN AND THAT CREATED BASICALLY THE FRAMEWORK FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE THIS WORK AND I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M I'M GOING INTO THIS NOT SO MUCH TO TELL YOU KNOW WHAT NEUTRAL HAS DONE. BUT TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THESE THINGS CAN BE APPLE A COUPLE ACROSS THE STATE. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT- YOU DON'T NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL THAT THERE ARE ALL WE CAN ALL LEVERAGE EACH OTHER BY SHARING THIS KIND OF INFORMATION AND WORKING COLLECTIVELY. HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND NOT TO SAY THAT SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS. ARE THE BEST FIT FOR EVERY COMMUNITY. BUT THEY CAN CAN HELP AND BITING THE BULLET. FOR THAT. US WHAT WE ARE HAVE TO BE. MORE TO JUST. OUR PROGRAM BASED ON ON WHAT WAS. IDENTIFIED IN THE METRO TRANSIT DEPARTS STRATEGIC PLAN. IS THAT WE REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON TWO PROGRAMS ONE BEING COMMUNITY ACCESS. AND THE SECOND BEING A SINGAPORE MOUNTAINS- ACCESS PROGRAM. IN A MINUTE TALK FIRST ABOUT THE COMMUNITY TRANSIT PROGRAM BECAUSE I THINK THIS ONE IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE'VE SEEN. A RECENTLY OUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AND THIS PART NEEDS ASSESSMENT- THAT DELHI COUNTY PARKS DID IS SO IMPORTANT TO BASICALLY. FRAME OUR WORK- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING IN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY- I HATE THAT TERM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHILE INCOME COMMUNITIES- THAT HAVE NOT HAD. THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT- THAT BROTHERS HAVE HAD OVER THE DECADES. ANDO WE FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON THOSE THREE REGIONS OF THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SAN. GABRIEL VALLEY BIG SHOUT OUT TO. HOW ARE SIMPLY. NOW BLACK GUY WHO. DREW BEALE WHO. I DEFINITELY AT APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENCE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THEN IN THE- SOUTHEAST AND LA AREA WHERE WE HAVE YOU KNOW SOME REALLY SERIOUS I'LL PARK ADMISSION SEATS. SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING OUR ATTENTION IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE GET THOSE PEOPLE OUGHT TO THAT DARK GREEN AREA THAT YOU SEE AT THE TOP OF THE MAP WHICH IS OUR NATIONAL FORESTS. AND THEN ON THE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THAT- THAT GRAPHIC WELL THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS WHICH ARE ALSO YOU KNOW THEORETICALLY WITHIN ABOUT AN HOUR'S DRIVE. FROM MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES BUT- IN REALITY A WORLD AWAY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSPORTATION ALL COMMUNITY TRANSIT PROGRAM THAT IS BASED ON HOGE'S. LOCATED WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT COULD PAY TAKE PEOPLE DIRECTLY ON A REGULAR BASIS AUG TWO PUBLIC LANDS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK THIS PROGRAM. IS JUST- SO VIABLE- ALL WE KNOW IS THAT- YOU KNOW THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE STATE IS OFFERING AND THAT WE HAVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I DO TRY TO PROMOTE THESE PROJECTS ARE IMPORTANT- THAT WE FOCUS ON THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH LIMITED OPTIONS. THAT WE DELIVER COMPREHENSIVE WRAP AROUND SERVICES AND THAT FRANKLY WAS STATE FUNDING IS I THINK THIS COMMITTEE DOES VERY WELL HAS BEEN CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW STATE FUNDS SO FAR. BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW SOME OF THE FINDINGS OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE LIMITED TO. INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE THAT ELEMENT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT BOTH IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN AT THE DESTINATIONS TO ENSURE THAT WERE. EFFECTIVELY YOU'RE JUST CREATING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY INSTEAD OF JUST FRANKLY PROVIDED A BUS SERVICE- AND WE ALSO WANT TO IN THIS PROGRAM ALL OFFER SOMETHING WITH MULTIPLE DESTINATIONS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE SHOULDN'T HAVE ALLOWED JUST ONE OPTION FOR COMMUNITIES SO THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO. GO TO THE BEACHES IN THE SUMMER GOING TO THE MOUNTAINS IN THE FALL YOU KNOW VISIT THEIR LOCAL PARKS WHEN IT'S COLD BUT MAYBE. YOU KNOW THEY WANT. TO GET OUTSIDE ALL THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE THERE COULD AND- APPROACH. SERVICE FROM THE COMMUNITY. TO THESE. AND HAS AN ORIENTATION EDUCATIONAL INTERPRETATION PROGRAMS WHICH REALLY ALLOWED THE VISITORS TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT SOME OF THESE PUBLIC LANDS THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING THEM TO. AND I'M JUST GONNA GO THROUGH THESE REALLY QUICKLY WE HAD A GRANT FROM KAISER THAT HELPED HELPED US TO- DO THESE PROJECTS IN CERTAIN OTHER RIVERS ARE IN DISTRICTS IN LA COUNTY. ALL YOU CAN SEE VERY WELL ATTENDED- WE OPERATE ON A MODEL OF THAT PROMOTE OTHER ARTISTS IN THE COMMUNITIES WHICH HELP US TO. REALLY GENERATE SOME PHENOMENAL PARTICIPATION. OF THE SECOND PROGRAM THAT'LL TALK ABOUT VERY QUICKLY IS CALLED THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS- TRANSIT AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. AND THIS IS BASICALLY TO TRY TO MAKE. USE OF THE LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM IN LA COUNTY OF KNOWN AS THE GOLD LINE. UP THAT COULD PROVIDE ACCESS UP INTO THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS WE HAVE HAD SO MANY MANY PILOT PROJECTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AFTER THE SANDY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL MONUMENT WAS PROCLAIMED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INTEREST ON HOW WE CAN GET PEOPLE UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND I THINK THAT THE OTHER POINT I WANNA MAKE REAL QUICKLY ABOUT BOTH THESE PROGRAMS BOTH THE GOLD LINE PROGRAM AND UP. IN THE COMMUNITY TRANSIT PROGRAM SOME OF THE COROLLARY BENEFITS ARE ABOUT. REDUCING B. M. T. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR RESOURCES BY NOT HAVING SO MANY PEOPLE USE OUR ROADS. AND HAVE IMPACTS TO THOSE YOU KNOW. RELATIVELY LIMITED ACCESS POINTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TO SOME OF THESE PUBLIC LANDS. SO IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT PROJECT AND THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA. THROUGH THE SLIDE IN THERE BECAUSE IT REALLY DEMONSTRATES THE FACT THAT- YOU KNOW THESE KINDS OF ACCESS PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN AROUND. FOR A VERY LONG TIME THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW THE NUCLEAR THAT WAS VERY ACTIVE- BACK IN THE DAY AND IT MIGHT FORGET THE EXACT DATE BUT- THEY YEAR IT'S BEEN AN OPERABLE FOR DECADES- BUT PROVIDES US. WITH A WINDOW INTO YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES ARE. AND- YOU KNOW SAYS TO REALLY SEE KNOW HOW WE DEMONSTRATE THIS FOR THE FOR. AWESOME YOU KNOW WHY ARE WE DOING THIS AND BURNELL JUSTICE YOU KNOW 82% OF OUR COMMUNITIES OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THEY HAVE POOR PUBLIC HEALTH THEY HAVE NATURE DEFICIT DISORDER ALL RIGHT AND- IN ORDER- YOU KNOW ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PUBLIC. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION IS BOTH THE NUMBER ONE AND THE NUMBER TWO BARRIER- TO ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS. ON YOU KNOW THE ISSUE OF HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS PROGRAM OPERATIONAL AND HOW CAN BE A GAME CHANGER. IS YOU KNOW A PRETTY SELF EVIDENT. IT SAYS IS THE SAME PEOPLE MOUNTAINS PART OF THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE ONE IN TWENTY AMERICANS SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE EVERY TIME I SAY THAT. IS BE THE CHILLS LIVE WITHIN A NINETY MINUTE DRIVE OF THE COOSA RESOURCE. AND THESE MOUNTAINS OF PROVIDED YOU KNOW SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RECREATIONAL ACCESS IN THE STATE IT SURPASSES EVEN YOU SOMEBODY. ALL RIGHT AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE MULTIPLE BENEFITS ALREADY. ALL THESE LINES ON THIS MAP- ARE ABOUT THE LIGHT RAIL SYSTEMS IN LA COUNTY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO. POINT OUT- I'M SORRY FOR IT APPARENTLY DID NOT BRING THE SITE WITH ME. BUT THE GOLD LINE IN PARTICULAR THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER WITH THAT PROVIDES THE ACCESS DIRECTLY INTO THE SAINT GABRIEL'S. GOES THROUGH THE COMMUNITY OF EAST LA. IN LOS ANGELES WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST TRANSIT DEPENDENT COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE IN THE COUNTY. AND THIS WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO- TO ACCESS. THE SAME GIVE OR MOUNTAINS. SO YOU KNOW WHY THIS IS THE- TIME WITH HER MANY OF THINGS ARE READY- IN. OF THE YOUR SPEECH. AT A TERM DEMAND FOR THE OUTDOORS IN PARTICULAR NOW WE CALLED IT. THERE'S A STARK DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO NATURE ALL WE HAVE TO HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL AND FUNDING ALIGNMENT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS. AND ALL THERE WAS A DOT DESIRE FROM AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. ALL WE'VE HAD TONS OF PILOT PROJECTS AND MANY YOU KNOW GREAT PHOTOS TO. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT. ON AT THE END OF THE DAY- MY EASY SENTIMENT AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY TO ALL OF YOU IS THAT. YOU KNOW LET'S GET DONE WITH THE PILOT PROJECTS WE NEED TO MAE THIS WORK- AFFECTED COMMUNITY LED EQUITABLE ACCESS PROGRAMS ARE CRITICALLY NEEDED. ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOW WOULD THERE SAY THROUGHOUT THE NATION YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST. A WAY THAT WE HAVE TO CONNECT OUR PEOPLE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THEM HEALTHIER- INTO IT BOTH. PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. ALL WE HAVE TO HAVE ADAPTABLE POLICIES WHICH YOU KNOW I. REALLY COMMEND STATE PARKS FOR ALL WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THE OUTDOOR EQUITY PROGRAM IN MAKING SURE THAT IT IS GOING TO MEET OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS. WE NEED FUNDING AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL- AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW SOME OF THA FEDERAL FUNDING IS GOING TO COME TO US- YOU KNOW SOON- WE WANT TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE SUCCESS STORIES THAT ALREADY EXIST. AND ELEVATE THOSE PROGRAMS SO THAT THEY CAN- THEY CAN BE FUNDED. SO I HOPE THAT WAS QUICK ENOUGH AND I TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF. EXTRA TIME BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. DISCUSS THESE THINGS WITH YOU AND I JUST WANT TO DO A BIG SHOUT OUT TO A PARTY OUT. OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT I'VE HAD A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH NOW FOR. MANY YEARS AND THEY HAVE A MEMBERSHIP FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I THINK- WOULD BE REALLY. INTERESTED IN COLLABORATING WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO FURTHER THE EFFORTS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU BELINDA YOU ANSWERED A COUPLE QUESTIONS WE HAD AS A RELATED TO EQUITABLE ACCESS BARRIERS ENCOUNTERING. PEOPLE. FOR OUTDOOR IT. AND ALSO- YOU GIVE US A GOOD. OF SOME OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE- IT NATURE FOR. THING YOU THERE ARE ANY OTHER. WILL GET AT THE TOP. I'M GONNA ASK MARK. HINDLEY IF HE CAN YOU KNOW CONDENSES PLANTATION TIPPING UP THREE MINUTES AS WELL AS- HELP WITH WALLS LAWLER. AND AND THEN WE CAN TRY TO GET. SOME SPEED QUESTIONS AT THE END WE'RE WE'RE DOWN TO ABOUT TEN MINUTES SO- THANK YOU. FLOOR'S YOURS NOW FOR NEXT WEEK- MISTER MARK KELLY YEP CAN YOU HEAR ME YES SIR. IT WAS BUSTED RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK KELLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC POLICY. AND WE REPRESENT ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND- MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE. ABU OUR STAFF WORKS WITH- THEM TO CONSERVE WATER FOWL HABITAT AT WETLANDS AND PROTECT OUR HUNTING HERITAGE SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT- I WILL TRY TO CUT MY PRESENTATION DOWN- HERE A LITTLE BIT WHEN I JUMPED WITH GLEE INTO WHAT I THINK CAN BE DONE TO HELP INCREASE- HUH- SPECIFICALLY HUNTING ACCESS- AND ENCOURAGE MORE PARTICIPATION IN CALIFORNIA- SPECIFICALLY ON- DEAR DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE PLANTS. FOR ME IT NEEDS MORE FUNDING AND STAFF TO MANAGE IT STATE WILDLIFE AREAS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHICH INCLUDE MANAGE WETLANDS BECAUSE THOSE MANAGED WETLANDS COSTS SIGNIFICANT SUMS OF MONEY TO MAINTAIN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. EXPENSES RELATED UP PUMPING WATER MISKITO ABATE MET FUEL NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL HAVE ALL RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS BUT THE BUDGETS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH THAT- WILDLIFE HABITAT QUALITY NOT ONLY STOPPERS BUT IT CAN ALSO REDUCE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT RECREATIONAL USE ONE FOR EXAMPLE. WETLAND FLOODING HAS TO BE DELAYED BECAUSE THERE'S INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PUMP WATER. OUT WHILE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING OUR WORK DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE LANDS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT I THINK A LOT MORE RESOURCES NEED TO BE TAKE DEDICATED THERE WE'VE GOT A LONG CALL TO GO TO REALLY GET THOSE. WILDLIFE AREAS OPERATING AT THEIR OPTIMAL CAPACITY. SOMETHING ELSE OUT WE THINK NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT- WE HAVE A VERY ANTIQUATED LICENSE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA HUNTING LICENSE SYSTEM AND FISHING LICENSE- THAT NEEDS TO BE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM. WHILE OTHER STATES HAVE EMBRACED TECHNOLOGY CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE STILL RELIES ON PAPER HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSES. THIS NOT NOT ONLY MAKES IT MORE BURDENSOME ON THE HUNDRED CHOIR AND PROVED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIELD THAT HERE SHE HAS ALL THE REQUIRED LICENSES AND VALIDATIONS BUT IT'S FRANKLY A DISINCENTIVE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER VERSED IN TECHNOLOGY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HUNTING. SO ALLOWING LICENSES AND VALIDATIONS TO BE DISPLAYED ON A MOBILE DEVICE WOULD PROVIDE CONVENIENCE AND ALSO FULLY BRING OUR LICENSING SYSTEM INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THERE'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM THAT THAT HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE CALLED THE SHARE PROGRAM. AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT PROGRAM EXPANDED. SHARE PROGRAM- IS THERE A PROGRAM WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE PROVIDES FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO LANDOWNERS- TO BASICALLY ALLOW ACCESS FOR HUNTING AND OTHER WILDLIFE DEPENDENT RECREATION. IN DOING SO THE PROGRAM ALSO ENCOURAGES LANDOWNERS TO MAINTAIN OUR LAND AS WILDLIFE HABITAT SO IT HAS THE DUAL BENEFIT. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM IT'S BEEN VERY LIMITED- IT'S BEEN MOSTLY GENERATED BY USER FEES- IMPOSED ON THE RECREATIONAL PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM. WHICH IS REALLY RESTRICTED THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN AND ROLL UP AND DOWN THE STATE. SO WE WOULD SAY THAT FUTURE YOU KNOW PARKING OPEN SPACE BOND SHOULD. BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROGRAM IT'S A IT'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND FOR IT AND WE JUST NEED FUNDING TO ARE REALLY FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TAKE IT STATEWIDE. WE ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND- THE STATE CREATED OR STRENGTHENED PARTNERSHIPS WITH NON- WITHOUT CONSERVATION ON PROFITS A GROWING NUMBER OF NONPROFIT CONSERVATION GROUPS IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THE OUTDOORS OUR ORGANIZATION HAS DEVELOPED A HUNT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC ACCESS FOR WATERFOWL HUNTING TO SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OF PRIVATE LAND INCLUDING SEVERAL PROPERTIES- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE SYSTEM IN MARCH. THAT WE ACTUALLY OWNED IN FEE- THIS MOST NOTABLY INCLUDES- SPECIAL HONEY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTIVE DUTY MIDDLE MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS. SO THAT'S A GREAT PART OF OUR PROGRAM IN OUR VIEW. ALTHOUGH IT WAS CURTAILED LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE CODE WE ALSO OFFER YOUTH AND EDUCATION CAMPS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO INTRODUCE NEWCOMERS TO HUNTING FISHING AND THE OUTDOORS- IN ADDITION WE ADMINISTER. THE BECOMING AN OUTDOORS WOMAN PROGRAM. WHICH MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY. FOCUSES ON PROVIDING WOMEN WHO TEND TO BE UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE HUNTING AND FISHING COMMUNITY WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN OUTDOOR SKILLS- IN A SAFE AND- ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENT- WE'RE ALSO WORKING BY THE WAY WITH- ON FUTURE INITIATIVES WITH OUTDOOR AFRICA EXCUSE ME OUTDOOR AFRO. WHICH FOCUSES ON CONNECTING AFRICAN AMERICANS WITHOUT DOOR EXPERIENCES SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. THE PROGRAMS- THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT RELY HEAVILY ON VOLUNTEERS AND DONATIONS TO KEEP COSTS TO THE PUBLIC AT A MINIMUM- THAT DEMAND FOR THESE PROGRAMS TYPICALLY EXCEEDS AVAILABLE SPACE. AND SOME PEOPLE MUST UNFORTUNATELY BE TURNED AWAY. THE MAJOR LIMITING FACTOR THOUGH IS THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE LANDS AND VENUES. IF THE STATE COULD OFFER UP SOME OF ITS OWN PROPERTIES WHERE NON PROFITS COULD IMPLEMENT THEIR OUTDOOR ACCESS PROGRAMS. THAT WOULD CERTAINLY ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE SO I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE. I ALSO KNOW THAT- THERE ARE SOME STATE PROPERTIES WITH THE STATES SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE STAFF RESOURCES TO ADMINISTER PUBLIC USE PROGRAMS. IN THESE CASES NONPROFIT CONSERVATION CONSERVATION GROUPS COULD HELP TO FILL THAT VOID MAKE THEM YOU KNOW USABLE FOR THE PUBLIC. SO THEY'RE REAL- ARE THESE OPPORTUNITIES OUT ON THE TABLE AND WE JUST NEED TO I THINK FULLY COME TOGETHER AND- FIVE DAY OUT WORKING AGREEMENT AND IMPLEMENT THEM AND DOUBT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP TO SOLVE SOME OF THIS PROBLEM THAT WERE SEEN OUT ON THE LANDSCAPE. SO WITH THAT- I AM OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS OR ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY NEED THANK YOU THANK YOU MARK THAT WAS GREAT- APPRECIATE YOU. JUMPING RIGHT IN IN TERMS OF WHAT SOME OF THE ISSUES ARE THAT- THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS ON SELF WE'RE GONNA GO INTO A- KELLY WALSH LAWLER THE PRESIDENT OF C. AND C. O. PARKS CALIFORNIA WE'RE DOWN TO THE LAST FIVE MINUTES. GOING TO SEE IF WE CAN. GET THIS PRESENTATION DONE AND THEN GET SOME SPEED QUESTIONS AND AT THE END SO. THANK YOU FOR YOURS. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS KELLY I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF PARKS CALIFORNIA. AS CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS STATUTORY PARTNER WE HAVE A SIMPLE MISSION IS TO HELP STRENGTHEN PARKS INSPIRE ALL TO EXPERIENCE THESE EXTRAORDINARY PLACES. AS BACKGROUND QUICKLY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE PARKS FOR COMMISSION WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE DECIDED ADOPTED THE PARKS FORWARD PLAN. A PARK SUPPORT ENTITY NOW KNOWN AS PARKS CALIFORNIA WAS A PART OF THAT PLAN. AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE SENATE PASSED SB ELEVEN ELEVEN WHICH AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENT TO ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP. FIRST CALIFORNIA WAS ESTABLISHED IN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IS A FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE PARTNER WORKING FROM THE INSIDE OUT. WITH CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. WE HAVE AN MO YOU WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT ARE FOCUSED ON SEVEN KEY GOALS WHICH I'LL TOUCH UPON THE ACTUAL WORK THAT WE DO TOGETHER. ANNUALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS CALIFORNIA NOW USED A FORMALIZED PROCESS JUST LIKE SELECT SHARED PRIORITY INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION WE KNOW OUR STRENGTH IS IN OUR COLLABORATION. WE'VE HEARD THAT NUMEROUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. OUR WORK HAS THREE AREAS OF FOCUS AGAIN LANDED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND REC. THE FIRST IS ACCESS INTERPRETATION AND EDUCATION. THE SECOND NATURAL RESOURCES PROTECTION AND STEWARDSHIP AND THE THIRD PARTY CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. ON AXIS INTERPRETATION AND EDUCATION WE'RE HELPING TO CLOSE THE PARK ACCESS GAP. CALIFORNIA WORKS THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO KEEP MANY FROM EXPLORING AND APPRECIATING STATE PARKS AND PUBLIC LANDS. AND OUR UNIQUE APPROACH WHICH IS PUSHES BEYOND VISITATION GOALS TO ALSO ADDRESS VISITOR EXPERIENCE AND RELEVANCY. FOSTERING DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH NATURE AND ULTIMATELY A NEW GENERATION THAT LOVES AND SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. ARE WORKING PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH IS CENTERED ON INVESTING IN TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS FOR ACCESS. IMPROVING OUTDOOR ACCESS AND PARKOUR COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH A ROUTINE PART SMART PROGRAM. ELEVATING THE VISIBILITY OF PARKS YOUR STORYTELLING AND COMMUNICATIONS INCLUDING AN EMPHASIS ON THE SUCCESS OF THE PROP. SIXTY EIGHT FUNDED STATEWIDE PARK PROGRAM. TELL MORE OF THE UNTOLD THAT OCCURRED ON THESE PROTECTED LANDS AND ALSO RUN THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF PARK CONNECTION PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE JUNIOR RANGERS JUNIOR LIFEGUARDS AND PORTS. SO INTEGRAL TO TEACHERS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND TWENTY TWENTY REACHING OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND TEACHERS AND STUDENTS DURING CO. UNDER NATURAL RESOURCES PROTECTION AND STEWARDSHIP WE WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES DIVISION. WE WORK TO STRENGTHEN LANDSCAPE SCALE STEWARDSHIP TO ADDRESS PRESSING CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. TO ENSURE THE PARKS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE BIODIVERSITY FOR GENERATIONS. WE KNOW STATE PARKS CANNOT TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE ALONE WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A PORTFOLIO OF PARTNERSHIPS. INNOVATIVE TOOLS TRAININGS AND WORKFORCES ALLMAN OPPORTUNITIES. TO MEET THESE PRESSING CHALLENGES WE KNOW WE NEED MORE TRAINED STEWARDS AT ALL PROFESSIONAL LEVELS ACROSS THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT CLIMATE RESILIENT SOLUTIONS. WE ALSO RECENTLY LAUNCHED HER CAREER PATHWAYS GRANT PROGRAM TO GROW AND STRENGTHEN THE WORK FORCE BY HELPING TO ENSURE THAT STATE PARKS WORKFORCE REFLECTS THE RICH DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S GROWING POPULATION. LASTLY PARKS CALIFORNIA FOCUSES ON PARK CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS BY WORKING TO AUGMENT THE FUND RAISING CAPACITY OF THE DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. AS WE ALL WORK COLLECTIVELY TO ENGAGE THE NEXT GENERATION OF PARK VISITORS MUST ALSO CONSIDER WHAT THE FUTURE PARK VISIT WILL ENTAIL. WE KNOW OUR LEGACY MUST PROVIDE A WORLD CLASS EXPERIENCE AND VIBRANT HEALTHY PARKS THAT WELCOME ENGAGE AND INSPIRE. BY WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WILL HELP STRENGTHEN OUR STATE PARK SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THAT OUR PARKS AND OUR COMMUNITIES BOTH THRIVE EVERYONE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN CREATING THIS LEGACY AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE. TO BE A PART OF IT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH WHERE WE HIT THE TWELVE MARK WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY ON. PUBLIC COMMENTS. AT THIS POINT- BUT- BELINDA DID TOUCH ON A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD OUTLINED FOR A MARK. WE DO HAVE A QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO METRICS THAT SHOW ATTENDANCE IN THE ORGANIZATION'S PROGRAMS. AND WE ARE THE KIND OF EXPANDED INTERESTS. AND ATTRACTING DIVERSE POPULATIONS OF THE STATE AND THEN FOR- PARKS CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW BUT THIS MODEL IS UNIQUE- THAT WE WANT TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT. THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING TO SUPPORT- THE STATE AGENCY AND OTHER ENTITIES DOING THIS WORK. WHAT WE'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU KNOW WHAT- WHAT OTHER AREAS OF SUPPORT DO YOU THINK THAT THE ORGANIZATION CAN PROVIDE- THE STATE AGENCY TO REACH ACHIEVE ITS GOALS OF ACCESS TO PARKS. SO WHAT WILL GO TO MARK IN THE END OF A DOLLAR AND I THINK AFTER THAT- IF THERE AREN'T ANY- INDIVIDUALS ON THE CALL- WE WILL HAVE- COMPLETED OUR OUR HEARING BUT. THE MARKET STILL WITH US THE. CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY GREAT YEAH IN TERMS OF METRICS WE DO SURVEYS OF PARTNERS IN WHICH WE LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND SEE HOW WE ARE CHANGING OVER TIME AND I WILL SAY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS WE HAVEN'T. GOTTEN A GREATER NUMBER OF WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE- IN HONEY WE'VE ALSO SEEN TRUE THAT BECOMING ABOUT OUTDOORS WOMAN PROGRAM. GREAT INTEREST IN OUR HUNTING AND FISHING AND AGAIN THE AVAILABLE SPACE- IT HAS BEEN EXCEEDED BY THE DEMAND SO WE KNOW THERE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW WOMEN THAT DO YOU WANT TO GET. INTO THE OUTDOORS AND EXPERIENCE HUNTING AND FISHING. I THINK- THERE PROBABLY IS ROOM TO DO A MORE SCIENTIFIC SURVEY THOUGH OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA. SO I WOULD CERTAINLY YES SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW JUST SURVEY INFORMATION AND ANECDOTAL INFORMATION ISN'T GOING TO CUT IT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE MORE OF A SCIENTIFIC- ANGLE ON ALL THIS SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE WE SHOULD LOOK TO IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MARK. THE NEXT QUESTION NOT TOO MUCH OLDER- JUST KIND OF HIGHLIGHTING SOME THE STATE AGENCY AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT THIS MODEL- THE- ARE WE SEEING THIS SAME APPROACH IN OTHER PLACES. AROUND THE COUNTRY. YES THANK YOU I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT WILL HELP US MOVE THIS PARTNERSHIP FORWARD ONE I THINK THAT WE NEED- TO CONTINUE DOING THESE FORMALIZED SHARE PRIORITY SETTING MOMENTS IN TIME WHERE WE DO CALL TO ACTION ACROSS ALL PARK DISTRICTS SO WE'RE HEARING FROM THE PARKS. EMPLOYEES ON THE GROUND AND ALSO WITH THE SACRAMENTAL LEVEL WE'RE UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE ISSUES ARE ON BOTH AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL BUT ALSO AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. ARE GRANT PROGRAMS ARE DEEPLY EMBEDDED INTO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SO THAT WE ARE HEARING AGAIN FROM COMMUNITIES MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING MOST WITH ACCESS AND RELEVANCY WHEN THEY DO ARRIVE INTO PARKS ON WHAT THEY NEED AND HOW WE CAN BEST SERVE THEM. AND THE THIRD COMPONENT IS FUNDRAISING WE ARE HERE TO ADD FUNDING INTO THE SYSTEM- THROUGH- THROUGH PRIVATE SECTOR FOUNDATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WE'RE HERE TO HELP WITH ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT AREAS AND FEEL- THAT IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS AND- AS THEY LOOK FORWARD I DON'T BELIEVE THAT STATUTORY PARTNERS ARE ARE TYPICAL AS WE LOOK NATIONWIDE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS WAS BORN THROUGH SB ELEVEN ELEVEN THAT THIS WAS MEANT TO SERVE AS-A MODEL ON TO BE ANALYZED AS A MODEL AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO POTENTIAL- NATIONAL GROWTH MODELS OF BUT RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE WE ARE. WE ARE PAVING THE WAY. ONE MORE QUESTION IS THERE A SPECIFIC- PROJECT A PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH STATE PARKS TO REALLY- CELEBRATE TAKE A LOOK AT THE HIGHLIGHTS- SOME POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. THEN I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR BELINDA THEY JUST CAME IN FROM- FOLKS WATCHING- EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS- SO WILL WILL THEN WITH THOSE TWO QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW I'M I'M EXCITED ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR MULTI STAKEHOLDER PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE JUST KICKED OFF OFFICIALLY IN SOUTH FRESNO CALLED OUTDOOR ACCESS TOGETHER AND GRANT TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. AND LEVERAGING MULTIPLE NONPROFIT PARTNERS INCLUDING LATINO OUTDOORS AND OUTDOORS AND POWER NETWORK AND THIS PROGRAM IS FOCUSED WITH THE COMMUNITY WHO'S ASKED FOR THAT ACCESS WHO WANT MORE COMFORT AND RELEVANCE WHEN THEY GO TO PARKS. AND WE'RE WORKING AS A CONNECTOR- BRINGING IN FUNDING TO THE MULTI STAKEHOLDER APPROACH BUT ALSO HELPING TO BRING THE COMMUNITY OUT TO MILLER TEN WHICH IS ONE OF THE CLOSEST STATE PARKS. AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH STATE PARK EMPLOYEES ON THE GROUND IN THAT PARK. WHO ARE READY FOR THEM WHEN THEY ARRIVE AND WHOARE THERE TO SUPPORT AND HELP THEM. I THINK AS WE LOOK MORE BROADLY AT LISTENING TO COMMUNITY NEEDS AND HELPING TO PLAY THAT CONNECTOR ROLE WHICH DOES INCLUDE A COMPONENT OF FUNDING WE SEE A REAL SCALABLE INNOVATIVE OPPORTUNITY MOVING FORWARD STATEWIDE. GREAT THANK YOU. A BLENDER SURE IT WILL JUST CHIME IN REAL QUICKLY I EAT- MENTIONED EARLIER HAVE BEEN IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORLD FOR PROBABLY ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AND IT'S BEEN REALLY. EYE OPENING IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND HOW DIVERSITY IN DURHAM BUT IN MINT HAS BECOME AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF EMERGING LEADERS SADDAM NORMA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT- AND THEN- THROUGH LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT I KNOW MANY ORGANIZATIONS RUN STATEWIDE WELL WE'RE SEEING A CHANGING DYNAMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP AWARD THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THAT IT IS MORE DIVERSE- BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON I THINK WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO- WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT. APPLICATIONS OF- DEVELOPING A NEW LEADERS AND MANAGERS AND DIRECTORS OF ORGANIZATIONS I WAS SO GLAD TO SEE ME- MISTER KING DENTAL- SELECTED AS A STATE PARK DIRECTOR WELL WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB- AND I THINK THAT IT'S CLOSE ACROSS THE BOARD- ERROR ASIAN YOU KNOW WHAT. THE PHILLY IT'S AND BLACK- COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALSO NEED TO BE AS VISIBLE SO WE JUST NEED TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND MAKE SURE THAT- WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR BETTER CALLS TO PROGRAMS TO FACILITATE THE WHOLE PROCESS% THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THAT IS A QUESTION THAT- YOU KNOW WE RAISE- THROUGHOUT THE STATE AGENCIES SPECIFICALLY THIS WASTED WERE TALKING ABOUT AND SO. TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR HONEST RESPONSE TO THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING WE DID GO BACK OVER BUT THEY'RE WELL WORTH THE TIME AND THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED I ALSO WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE A- THE PRIOR- PANELISTS THAT WERE WITH US IN THE PRIOR TO THE SEGMENT'S. AT THANK YOU SO MUCH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WERE HERE WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD TURN OUT FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE A HEARING A STAY TUNED FOR ADDITIONAL HEARINGS ON SUBJECTS RELATED TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY BUT- MIGHT MY GRATITUDE TO ALL OF YOU PARTICIPATE ALSO ARE RECOGNIZED THE TEAM FROM THE BALL PARKS- WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE COMMITTEE FOR HELPING. US PUT THIS TOGETHER BRINGING ALL OF YOU ON ON BOARD WITH THAT- I DON'T KNOW- MINUTE LOOKED SEE WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY IN THE PALM. COMMENT Q. SO WHILE WE THAT MISTER CHAIR. YEAH NAME IS YOUR I DO. WE MAY HAVE ONE PERSON WHO WISHES TO SPEAK. ALLARDYCE I'M NOT COMPLETELY SURE. BUT I'LL JUST INVITE THAT PERSON HAS TO PRESS ONE BUTTON ZERO PLEASE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM LINE TWELVE- PARDON ME JUST A MOMENT THANK YOU ONE TWELVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF- THIS IS RICO MONSTER DID NOT- WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND. I FIRST WANT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR INDISPENSABLE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE HI LIGHTED BY- MAKING THAT A PRIORITY EVER SINCE YOU CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. I WANT TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON OUR QUEST AFTER AND- EQUITY- THE EVIDENCE OF THE MULTI BENEFITS OF THE PARK INDISPUTABLE. WE KNOW- HUMAN HEALTH BOTH PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CLIMATE ADAPTATION RECREATION QUALITY OF LIFE ENHANCE BIODIVERSITY BETTER WATER QUALITY AND AIR QUALITY YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE THINGS WE KNOW WHAT. THE DOWNSIDE OF NOT HAVING PARKS THAT CAN CHARGE. THE POOR HUMAN HELP HIGHER CHILDHOOD OBESITY LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE AND IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES AND VALUES AND THE CHALLENGE. IS RELIABLE ON GOING FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE STATEWIDE PARK PROGRAM IS. IT'S ACCEPTABLE IT'S BEEN OVER SUBSCRIBED BY A 1000% YOUR BEEN GREENING- PROGRAM AT NATURAL RESOURCES IS ALSO OVERSUBSCRIBED ENOUGH HUNDREDS OF PERCENT. AND VERY SUCCESSFUL ACCEPTABLE TO COMMUNITIES YEAH WE ARE DEPENDENT ON BONDS FOR- TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS THAT IS NOT. A APPROACH AT THE LA- THAT APPROPRIATE SOURCE TO SUPPORT ON GOING PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE UNRELIABLE- WE WANTED WE ALL THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A BOND LAST YEAR AND UP BECAUSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES OUT OF OUR CONTROL THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. WE HOPE TO HAVE A BOND IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN EITHER AND EVEN IF IT DOES WE WON'T HAVE NEW MONEY UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AT THE EARLIEST. THE LAST FUNDING FOR THE STATE WIDE PART PROGRAM IS GOING OUT THE FLOTATION OF- DEPUTY DIRECTOR MITCHELL MAN CHIMP IS HAPPENING ON TWELFTH THAT THE LAB ABOUT MONEY YOU'RE BEING. PROGRAM DIDN'T EVEN HELP PROPOSE FUNDING FOR IT THIS YEAR IN THE- AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK THE LET'S. TO RESTORE FUNDING THAT PROGRAM SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A HOT IT STARKLY A HIGH PRIORITY BUT LOOKED AT AS AN AMENITY. SO THE CHALLENGE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE LEADERS LIKE YOU. IS TOUGH LOOK FOR- FUNDING SOURCES ARE MORE RELIABLE- WE NEED ON GOING FUNDING THE NEED IS THERE- THE- YOU KNOW CONSEQUENCE OF NOT FUNDING- PARK ACCESS. IS DEVASTATING AND- THE FIRST PLACE WE SHOULD START THIS TO MAKE SURE PARTS ARE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF PEOPLE AND LOW INCOME DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS. WE SHOULD BE PUTTING PARKS WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON TRANSPORTATION OR- SOME OTHER WAY TO GET TO THE PLATE THE- AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY WALK LIKE SOME CALIFORNIANS CAN. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE- DONE YOUR WHOLE CAREER HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I APPRECIATE THE STAFF VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION TODAY I THINK IT'S IMMENSELY IMPORTANT. BUT IT ALWAYS BOILS DOWN TO PRIORITIES VALUES AND FUNDING AND OUR- WE WOULDN'T HAVE- YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STATE COURT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WORK OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAMS. IN THE THOUSANDS OF PERCENT IF WE WERE- PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING TO BASELINE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SO. TO SPEAK I- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO- YOU KNOW OFFERING MY- OPINIONS AND SUGGESTIONS AND ANY SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS OR OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE. THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN THANK YOU FOR OR- THE KNOWLEDGE OF ANOTHER WORK THAT- THIS COMMITTEE'S BEEN DOING AND CERTAINLY THE WORK THAT- WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS. AND VERY WELL RECEIVED AND TAKEN WITH THAT- WE WILL LEAD THE FIRST HEARING FOR THIS COMMITTEE INFORMATIONAL HEARING THANK YOU ALL AND- THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED. THANK YOU THANK. THANK YOU MR.
