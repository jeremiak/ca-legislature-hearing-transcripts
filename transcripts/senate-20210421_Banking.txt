THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- HOW SECOND YOUR HAPPY BIRTHDAY- SORRY CAN'T BE THERE IN THE CHAMBERS WITH YOU ALL MY COMING THROUGH OKAY YES YOU ARE OKAY- SOME PRESENTING TO YOU ALL SENATE BILL FOUR FOUR NINE TODAY. AND BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO IT JUST THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS VIEW LOOK ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS- IT WOULD MOVE ALL THE MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BILL FROM THE FINANCIAL CODE INSTEAD OF CORPORATIONS CODE. DOWNLOAD ALSO AMEND AT ANY PENALTY OF PERJURY. FOR HER ANY INCORRECT- FILINGS- ENDS. AS YOU CAN SEE HOPEFULLY IN YOUR ANALYSIS IT WOULD- THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT. CHANGES IN THEIR WINGS OF THE BILL THAT HOPEFULLY MAKE THIS A LOT MORE FEASIBLE AND WORKABLE GOING FORWARD AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING INTO THOSE- AS THE DISCUSSION GOES ON BUT- ESSENTIALLY- THIS BILL IS ABOUT. TRANSPARENCY DATA AND TRYING TO LIFT UP- STANDARDS AND BUILD SOME UNIFORMITY AND HOW CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE IS UNDERTAKEN IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. WE KNOW ABOUT ALL THE LIABILITIES AND RISKS TO OUR STATE LL TOO WELL WHETHER THE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE FROM- DROUGHTS. HOME OR WILDFIRES ON COMMUNITIES ARE SEA LEVEL RISE OR EXTREME HEAT EVENTS- SO I DON'T WANT TO. GENERATE TOO MUCH YOU'RE PREACHING TO ALL ABOUT THAT THE LEVEL OF CRIME AT RISK IN THE STATE OR ACROSS THE WORLD- THE IDEA HERE THOUGH IS THAT IF WE CAN PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE CORPORATIONS IN THE STATE- TO GET AHEAD OF THIS AND TO HAVE POLICIES THAT JUST ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THESE RISKS ARE WITHOUT ANY ACTUAL- DIRECTION AS TO EXACTLY HOW DO INVESTOR WHERE TO LAND- BUT TO HAVE SOME UNIFORMITY. IN HOW THAT REPORTING OCCURS THAT WILL WILL GET BETTER OUTCOMES OVERALL- THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM HAS EMBRACED THIS THIS CONCEPT OF USING SORT OF STANDARDIZED REPORTING WE SAW THEM INITIATED TASK FORCE- RECENTLY- AND ON ON CLIMATE RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES AND THIS BILL TRIES TO BUILD ON THAT TASK FORCE NOT JUST FOR PENSION FUNDS AND SOME OF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS BUT ALSO. ON THE STATE'S LARGER FINANCIAL INCORPORATED- INSTITUTIONS- THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS BILL WILL ADOPT- THIS TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE RELATED DISCLOSURES FRAMEWORK IT'S BEEN ADOPTED BY ALMOST TWO THOUSAND ORGANIZATIONS STATEWIDE IT'S EXISTED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN- YOU KNOW BRAND NAME INSTITUTIONS LIKE WELLS FARGO BANK OF AMERICA PRUDENTIAL BLACKROCK CALPERS CALPERS AND CAL STIRS- AND MANY OTHERS ARE ALREADY USING. THIS FRAMEWORK SO IF WE CAN- HOPEFULLY FEEL THE LITTLE STANDARDIZATION- IT'LL HELP FEDERAL EFFORTS AS WELL WHERE WE KNOW THE BY NOON INSPIRATION IS ACTIVELY CONSIDERING AT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A SIMILAR FEDERALLY APPROVED CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I HAVE AND I'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD WITH THE OPPOSITION OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS NINETY SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE GOOD FAITH EFFORT THAT THEY'VE MADE TO SURFACE SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WE DO HAVE SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT I'M OPEN TO ADDRESSING- SUIT TO FOR INSTANCE. MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'RE COMPLYING WITH THE FED ROLE DCF STAND THAT COMPLY SHOULD. AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT THAT WE DON'T WANT YOU TO GO THROUGH TWO SEPARATE SETS OF FILINGS I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANDHOPEFULLY WE'LL GET INTO THIS A LITTLE MORE IN THE COMMITTEE- WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY- A WILLINGNESS TO USE SOME OF THEIR EXISTING. DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK- BOTH THE NATIONAL AND STATE LEVEL THAT ARE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS PURSUING AS SOON AS A FORM OF COMPLIANCE WITH HIS MEASURES WELL WE DON'T WANT TO ADD A BUNCH OF BURDENS WE JUST WANT TO. WE WANT TO STANDARDIZE THE ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK HERE WE THINK THIS WILL HELP POSITION CALIFORNIA TO MITIGATE THIS RISK GOING FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY UP LESS COMMUNITIES IN THE PROCESS AND- I'LL I'LL STOP TALKING HERE BECAUSE I'M GLAD THAT YOU ALL TOO MUCH OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT WE'VE GOT A- ED. TO LEAD WITNESSES HERE DR DAN CAME IN FROM UC BERKELEY WAS- LEAD AUTHOR ON THE IPCC REPORT FOR AN- AD FOR THE FOR THE U. N. EFFORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEN. A JURY COURT. WAS THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR SUSTAINABLE INVESTING AT IMPAX ASSET MANAGEMENT YOU CAN GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE ACTUAL ASSET MANAGEMENT'S SIDE AND WHAT. FINDING IT EASY IF THE REPORT IN THIS KIND OF CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE DOES- POSITIVELY FOR INVESTMENT FUNDS AND THEN HEADLAM FROM UC BERKELEY CENTER FOR LAW AT ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT IS HERE. JUST ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT MAY ARISE- SO I. WOULD EXPECT THE ANSWER ABOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN AND I- I APOLOGIZE THAT I DID NOT ASK IF YOU HAD ANY STAFF IN THE ROOM. I'M SORRY I HAD MY DISTRICT DIRECTOR JEREMY WILL FEATURE. THING IN ANOTHER ROOM BUT HERE. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT FIRST WE HAVE A DOCTOR DAN AT CAN'T CAME IN. A PROFESSOR OF ENERGY AT UC BERKELEY AT DOCTOR CAME IN YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY. MY THANKS FOR BEING THERE I THINK THE- BOTH THE COMMITTEE AND DUCKED UNDER STERN OR TAKING ACTION ON THIS. I AM HONORED TO SPEAK STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE BILL OR FORTY NINE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. SENATE BILL FOR FORTY NINE DOES AS SENATOR JUST HIGHLIGHTED IS REALLY TO BE SINCE ABBAS BEST PRACTICES FOR THINGS THAT COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD ARE ALREADY DOING- IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT CALIFORNIA'S. PATH TO CARBON. NEUTRALITY GETS ONE- GENERATING LARGE NUMBERS JOBS WE'VE ALL SEEN THE SOLAR SECTOR ALONE RIGHTS TO OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND JOBS. WE ANTICIPATE SIMILAR GROWTH IN THE ENERGY STORAGE FIELD OFFSHORE WIND FIELDS ENERGY EFFICIENT BEING- AND A VARIETY OF ASPECTS RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION FOR WHICH WE WILL BE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR LATER TODAY AND THE PRESIDENT TOMORROW. THE CRITICAL ASPECT OF FOUR FOUR NINE ARE YOU KEEPING WITH WHAT CALIFORNIA DONE IN THE PAST. I PERSONALLY SERVED ON BOTH THE YEAH COMMITTEE THE ECONOMIC ALLOCATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT ESTABLISHED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND BEFORE THAT I WORKED ON CALIFORNIA'S- WORLD FAMOUS LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD- EXECUTIVE ORDERS AT SEVEN ZERO ONE. BOTH OF THE YEAR STARTED OFF WITH ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGIES AND TOOLS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT FOUR FOUR NINE WILL PUT IN PLACE. AND THE BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING THE AREAS OF JOB GROWTH THE PRO BUSINESS SIDE OF THE STORY BUT ALSO ESTABLISHING THE METHODOLOGY SO THAT OTHER. JURISDICTIONS TO WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH CALIFORNIA COULD BE INFORMED FROM THE BEGINNING ABOUT THE TYPES OF REPORTING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. BY LABORATORY FIELD AND OPERATE THE POOL CLIMATE CALCULATOR IT'S A TOOL THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND PNC AND CALGARY EDUCATION EACH USED TO IDENTIFY CARBON REDUCTIONS WHAT IS. BEING PROPOSED HERE IS THE TEMPLATE THE TEMPLATE TO STANDARDIZE THAT SAME SORT OF REPORTING. AND WE HAD TO DEBATE THE SAME SORTS OF BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIA AS IT CHARTS OUT THE- PRO. CLIMATE STRATEGIES. ONE ANSWER OF THIS WHICH NOT BE FREE READ. USE THAT THE BENEFITS THE CAL. ARE THE FORM OF VETERAN MORTGAGE ACCORDING TO A LARGE COMPANIES. BETTER REPORTING AND OF OUR BILL BUT ALSO. JUSTICE THE THAT WERE EIGHT TO GET THE STRATEGY TO ACCELERATE THE POINT OF CLEAN ENERGY SUCH AS WHAT MAY WOMEN THE BY TWENTY THIRTY ALL OF THIS VEHICLE WOULD BE VEHICLE. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF AN OPPORTUNITY. TO QUANTIFY THE BENEFITS. IT'S BEEN WITH SENATE BILL FOR FORTY NINE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO SPEAK. VERY MUCH HOPE THAT YOU WILL VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY. STRONG BUSINESS AND ARAMBULA JUSTICE CAP THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU DOCTOR CAME IN. NEXT WE HAVE A JULIE- GORKY- SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT TO AT IMPAX ASSET MANAGEMENT SURELY YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRMAN NORMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD REPRESENT IMPAX ASSET MANAGEMENT AND TRILLIUM ASSET MANAGEMENT LLC INDEPENDENT ADVISERS WITH MORE THAN FORTY FIVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. TODAY WE OFFER TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR FOUR NINE WHICH WOULD SET A STANDARD FOR CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BETTER MEET THE FIDUCIARY DUTY THAT WE HAVE TO OUR CLIENTS. TRANSACTION CHILEAN WE SERVE CLIENTS WHO ARE BELIEVE THAT INTEGRATING ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE FACTORS INCLUDING CLIMATE RISK INTO THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS PROCESS CAN HELP US TO IDENTIFY COMPANIES BEST POSITIONED TO DELIVER LONG TERM PROJECTS RISK ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE SHOULD FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR MISSION AND PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY UNDERSTAND THAT ANY. MATERIAL ESG CONCERNOR OPPORTUNITY THAT WE BELIEVE WILL HELP PROTECT OUR ENHANCE SHAREHOLDER VALUE WE. CAN CORPORATE. CHANGING QUITE CREE TANGIBLE IN REAL WILL NOT BE. FURTHER WARMING UP IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO DAMAGING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES POSSIBLY APPROACHING WATER. 5% OF GLOBAL GDP BY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WELL INVESTMENT IN CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES OFFER A PATH TOWARDS MORE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND JOB CREATION CALIFORNIA HAS CONSISTENTLY LED THE COUNTRY IN RECOGNIZING THESE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF CLIMATE RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH. MANAGED AND THE PRICE THEM TRANSPARENTLY AND COMPREHENSIVELY FROM INVESTORS LIKE US TO AVERAGE CONSUMERS TRADING WITH A FREE TIRE MEANT CLEAR CONSISTENT DISCLOSURE WILL ALLOW FOR BETTER DECISION MAKING FOR INVESTORS IN PARTICULAR UNDERSTANDING CLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES IS ESSENTIAL. TO OUR INVESTMENTS BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PRICE THOSE WITH CORRECTLY OR WE CAN WAIT FOR A SERIES OF INCREASINGLY UNPLEASANT SURPRISES. WHICH IS THE FORMER. CURRENTLY IN JAIL THERE NO YOU FOR INVESTORS TO HAVE A CALL VIEW OF WICH COMPANIES ARE EXPOSED TO CLIMATE RELATED RISKS ARE BEST POSITIONED TO BENEFIT FROM CLIMATE RELATED OPPORTUNITIES. OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE MARC AN INFORMED DECISION MAKING ON CLIMATE RISK INTENDED BY INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE DISCLOSURE WITHOUT CLEAR INCOMPLETE DATA IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO CRACK THE WHIP FROM OPPORTUNITIES CORRECTLY AND THAT IS WHY WE SUPPORT SB FOUR FOUR NINE. AND REPORTING ALIGNED WITH THE TEETH YET THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH SB FOUR FOUR NINE CALIFORNIA WOULD SET THE STANDARD FOR G. C. SEVENTY ALIVE DISCLOSURE PROVIDING INVESTORS WITH COMPARABLE ACCURATE AND ACTIONABLE INFORMATION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL. BOB MCDOUGAL CLIMATE RISKS AND RISKS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE DISPOSABLE DISCLOSURE OF WHICH WE RECOMMEND INTEGRATING INTO SB FOUR FOUR NINE SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING OF THESE RISKS WILL ALLOW US TO PUT THE CHAPEL WE CAPITAL WE MANAGE TOWARDS A MORE CONSISTENT.

MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING THE OTHER VIRTUAL FORMAT AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR IT TO WORK ON THAT MEASURE I AM NOT ONLY CREATED THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION AND ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS AT THIS TIME REMAIN OPPOSED TO AT THE FORECOURT NINE AS AMENDED APRIL THIRTEENTH. AND WE HAVE FULL FAITH THAT THE FIGHT INHERITED MINISTRATION WILL APPROPRIATELY AND VIGOROUSLY ADDRESSED THE NATION RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSUREHAS ALREADY EMERGED AS A PRIORITY FOCUS FOR FINANCIAL REGULATORS UNDER THE GUIDANCE CARE ACT ADMINISTRATION. ON MARCH FOURTH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF A NEW CLIMATE YES G. TASK FORCE AND IS NOW ACCEPTING PUBLIC COMMENT ON CLIMATE RISK REPORTING AND ESG DISCLOSURES. THE US FEDERAL RESERVE HAS STEPPED UP ITS EFFORTS TO EVALUATE THAT RISK THAT CLIMATE CHANGE POSES TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY CLIMATE COMMITTEE AND JUST SAID MONDAY U. S. TREASURY SECRETARY JANET YELLEN OUTLINED THE DEPARTMENT CLIMATE GOALS AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT'S NEW CLIMATE HOT. WHICH IS AN ESTABLISHED TO COORDINATE CLIENT FOCUSED WORK ACROSS THE AGENCY AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER PLEDGE TO PUT CLIMATE CHANGE FRONT AND CENTER EACH OF THE- NUMBERS FEDERAL LAW ACTION WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A HARMONIOUS INCONSISTENT DATA ENTERED METRIC AND THE CLOSURE. THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE SO DESPERATELY NEEDS IS NOT A PIPE DREAM AND THEN WELL WE APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR IS CONTEMPLATING AN AMENDMENT THAT MADE KNOWLEDGE THAT ACTION THAT KNOWLEDGE MEANT TO SUPPORT OUR TEAM AND DIG THE. VERY OBVIOUS QUESTION. WHY IN THE BUILDING NOW. THERE IS NO THAT CHANGE IS HAVING NEED IMPACT ON CAL. FISCAL AND ECONOMIC. AND THIS IS A VITAL. DEPARTED THE IN BUT HE THE PAUSE BUTTON ON AT THE FOUR NINE TODAY WILL NOT ONLY ALLOW PRESENT RIGHT AND ACT. IT WILL ALSO THE GOVERNOR NEEDS KIND RELATED RISK DISCLOSURE ADVICE GROUP WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED MY- TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT IT HAD BEEN. TO WITH. OF A CRIME AT RISK DISCLOSURE STANDARD BUT IT'S- WHAT BETTER AND- STANDARD. THE COLLABORATIVE. THAT ALIGNS FEDERAL. SHOULD BE THE TRUMP CLICK. THAT TO THE GLOBAL. FOR THESE REASONS WE- ASK FOR NO VOTE ANY FOUR CORNER DAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL ON MATT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRMAN TO COME MY NAME IS MATT POWERS WITH ASSOCIATE OF CAL LAW AND HEALTH INSURANCE COME ACT LIKE. LARGER SOCIO CURRENTLY HAS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB FOUR FOUR NINE. I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING SENATOR STERN WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. HOWEVER RECENT AMENDMENTS DID NOT ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED SB FOUR FOUR NINE CONTINUES TO OVERLAP WITH THE WORK THAT WE ARE ALREADY DOING FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AS BACKGROUND SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN. INSURERS HAVE BEEN COMPLETING THE CITY I ADMINISTERED CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE SURVEY. ANNUALLY AROUND ONE THOUSAND ENSURES COMPLETE THIS COMPREHENSIVE MANDATORY AND PUBLIC SURVEY. THAT ASKS ABOUT A NUMBER OF TOPICS INCLUDING ADMISSIONS INVESTMENTS. IMPACT MITIGATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT. THE SURVEY ALSO CAPTURES MORE THAN 70% OF THE ENTIRE U. S. INSURANCE MARKETS. CERTAINLY THE SURVEY WAS CREATED THROUGH A PROCESS BETWEEN OUR CALIFORNIA REGULATOR CDI IN THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS HEY I SEE. THIS PROCESS WITH DELIBERATE IF IT SOLICITED INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT AND FEEDBACK AND ENSURE THAT REPORTING COULD BE HARMONIZED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. IN LIGHT OF RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE SEC AND THE ONGOING WORK BEING DONE BY THE ANY ICY CLIMATE AND RESILIENCY TASK FORCE. REGARDING POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR INDUSTRY SURVEY WE THINK THAT SB FOUR FOUR NINE SHOULD BE AMENDED TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS. AND WHAT WE CURRENTLY REPORTS. IT SEEMS TO BE NO CLEAR PUBLIC POLICY RATIONALE FOR SETTING UP A DUPLICATIVE PROCESS THAT CIRCUMVENTS OUR SUCCESSFUL MODEL OF NATIONAL COORDINATION. LASTLY WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE YEARLY MANDATE TO PROPOSE REGULATIONS THAT SB FOUR FOUR NINE PLACES ON THE NEWLY LAUNCHED CALIFORNIA CLIMATE ADVISORY GROUP WE TAKE INSURANCE REGULATION PROPOSALS BELONG WITH OUR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND I SEE THESE ENTITIES UNDERSTAND INSURANCE OR BUSINESS MODEL HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND HAVE ALREADY TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN CLIMATE REPORTING. AGAIN I DO WANT TO THANK SENATOR STERN FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND FOR FUTURE DISCUSSIONS AROUND LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW OUR CURRENT REPORT TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL AND GIVE DIFFERENCE OUR CURRENT REGULATOR. BUT UNTIL THAT TIME WE CONTINUE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB FOUR FOUR NINE. AND I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT- WE HAVE- DAVE SNYDER WITH THE AMERICAN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION AS A TECHNICAL WITNESS SHOULD THERE BE ANY QUESTIONS AROUND- BE CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE SURVEY.

THANK YOU MODERATOR I THANK YOU TO ALL THE SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WE WILL NOW BEGIN AT BRING THIS TO THE DISCUSSION AT BACK TO MEMBERS MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR THOUGHT SENATOR MAN. YES- I HEAR THE CONCERNS OF THE BANKS I'VE TALKED WITH THE AND SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS IN OPPOSITION I HAVE TALKED WITH SENATOR STERN AT LENGTH ABOUT THIS BILL AND- I GUESS I'D SAY AT THE OUTSET CLIMATE CHANGE YOU KNOW STEPPING BACK FROM THIS BILL IS OBVIOUSLY AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO OUR WAY OF LIFE TO OUR ECONOMY- AND I THINK THIS TYPE OF DISCLOSURE BILL IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED- I WAS PLEASED TO SEE CENTER STERN A KNOWLEDGE MANY OF THE CONCERNS THE OPPOSITION IN TRYING TO- I DONT CHANGES THAT WERE SUGGESTED TO TRY TO NARROW THE SCOPE TO TRY TO PREVENT HIS BILL FROM BEING OVERLY ONEROUS- IN THE OPERATIONS OF BUSINESSES BUT- A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE IS NOT. A LOT OF COMPANIES AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THAT'S- A VERY HIGH THRESHOLD THE MEDIA AND I'D I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION FOR THE SENATOR- WOULD BE HOW MANY COMPANIES. DOESN'T ACTUALLY COVER IN CALIFORNIA. SENATOR STERN. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- A CINNAMON- WE JUST GOT SOME INFORMATION BACK THIS MORNING FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED- ENTITIES IN THE STATE. ROSS SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS WE DISCUSSED BUT- WITH WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE CONTEMPLATING ALSO WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WE THINK THAT NUMBER WOULD ACTUALLY GO. DOWN EVEN FURTHER AND THEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE WANT TO COMMIT TO TODAY WITH THE REALTORS WE THINK THAT NUMBER GOES DOWN FURTHER STILL SO. ABOUT RIGHT NOW ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED. THANK YOU CENTER AND I WAS SURPRISED I MET WITH I THINK IT WAS THE COMMUNITY BANKERS THE CREDIT UNIONS EARLIER THIS WEEK. AND I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THEM IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR REVENUES THRESHOLD. TO BE CLEAR THERE'S NOT THAT MANYBANKS OUT THERE THAT I BELIEVE MAKE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE YEAR- AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION- FOR EITHER. I THINK THE WITNESS FROM THE COFFEE MAKERS ASSOCIATION OR FROM THE SENATOR FROM CENTER STERN. WE HOW MANY BANKS OR CREDIT UNIONS ROUGHLY WHAT THIS COVER UP. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK- WITHIN THAT FIVE HUNDRED NUMBER CAN I ASK MY- TECHNICAL EXPERT HERE YEP AND I PERHAPS THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE. HE SAYS. I KNOW THERE'S STILL ALSO CATCHING UP. ANALYSIS YOU'RE DOING THEIR OWN ANALYSIS FOR THE SCOPE OF THIS THING SO I DON'T WANT TO RUSH THEM TOO MUCH BUT- I'LL JUST SAY THAT I. AND THE FIFTEENTH LARGEST BANKING CALIFORNIA DID NOT HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE SO RIGHT I DON'T I DON'T THAT COVERS CREDIT UNIONS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS BUT- I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE IS A SMALL NUMBER- AND- YOU KNOW I HEAR THE CONCERNS ABOUT OVER. REGULATION IN THE STATE HAVING TOO MANY LAYERS OF REGULATION- I HAVE TALKED WITH SENATOR STERN I KNOW THAT HE IS CONSIDERING WAYS TO AMEND THE BILL. TO ENSURE THAT IF THERE ARE REPORTS- ESG REPORTING REQUIREMENT FROM THE SEC OR OTHER REPORTS THAT THOSEWOULD SATISFY THE CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS. I WILL ALSO NOTE THERE IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THE ESG DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS WILL COME OUT OR THEY WILL BE ROBUST THERE ARE MANY GROUPS. WORKING HARD TO LOBBY AGAINST IT RIGHT NOW. AND SO I WOULD SAY I THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE BILL I AM HEARTENED BY THE AUTHORS EFFORTS TO TRY TO MAKE THIS. TAILORED TO TRY TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS OF OPPOSITION- SO I WOULD BE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE WOULD. LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU SENATOR MANNY I DID HERE IF THAT'S CORRECT A QUESTION FOR THE THOSE. ON THE LINE THAT CAN THAT ANSWER THE TECHNICAL QUESTION ABOUT THE BANKS THE NUMBER OF BANKS. THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THE SPELL. US SENATOR STERN I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOMEONE ON THE LINE I CAN ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND I WILL ALSO ALLOW MISQUOTE US TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AS WELL. HAPPY TO DEFER TO HIS CLAIM S. OR A- OR PUT THE ONUS ON TED LAMB ALTHOUGH SENATOR MEANS. HE'S GOOGLING SEEMS TO HAVE. GIVEN THE BEST ANSWER SO FAR- THANK YOU MISS CLEVERNESS CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN POSED REGARDING THE NUMBER OF BANKS THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED. BY THIS BILL THAT WOULD HAVE TO REPORT. SURE THE NOMINEE OF THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION FOUNDER MAN APPRECIATE THAT THE QUESTION. ON THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ADOPTED ON APRIL THIRTEENTH CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF A COVERED ENTITY. AND TO ME IN A CORPORATION PARTNERSHIP LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR OTHER BUSINESS ENTITY INCORPORATED FORM. OR ISSUED A LICENSE TO OPERATE OR CERTIFICATE OF AUTHORITY UNDER THE LIVE. SEAT THAT HAD ANNUAL GROSS REVENUES OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CALENDAR YEAR PRIOR. TO FREEZING ISSUED A LICENSE TO OPERATE OR A CERTIFICATE OF THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE I THINK A LITTLE BIT NEBULOUS. AND SO WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR IN HOUSE WILL DETERMINE EXACTLY WHO WOULD QUALIFY FOR WHAT AND. QUALIFY UNDER THAT DEFINITION. BUT THIS TIME I CAN'T GIVE YOU A NUMBER BECAUSE WORK WE'RE HONESTLY NOT SURE WHICH ENTITIES WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE CURRENT DEFINITION. WE ALSO FIND THAT CONCERNED WITH THE AUTHORITY I THINK THAT UNDERSTANDS THEIR CONCERNS. AND WITH A LITTLE BIT AND THAT PERHAPS MAINTENANCE WITH THE DEFINITION SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE. ARE IN DISCUSSION ABOUT. THANK YOU. AND NEXT WE HAVE A SENATOR PORTANTINO THAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SINCE SENATOR EGGMAN. HOOPS THAT WAS A MAJOR GROUPS YES CENTER- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WANT TO START OFF BY COMPLIMENTING CENTER STERN I MEAN HE'S BEEN- ROLLING UP HIS SLEEVES AND REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE RISK- THIS CLIMB EMERGENCY THAT IS GRIPPING- NOT JUST CALIFORNIA BUT THE ENTIRE WORLD AND- HE'S REALLY BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO IT TO ADDRESS IT LEGISLATIVELY- AND I ALSO WANT TO COMPLIMENT HIM FOR- WORKING SO HARD WITH. A DISPARATE INTERESTS- EVERYBODY HAS A TAKE CLEARLY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MAKING EFFORTS- THE VICE ADMINISTRATION WHICH WE ALL APPLAUD AND SUPPORT. THOSE EFFORTS- I DID WANT TO JUST MAKE ONE SPECIFIC COMMENT. RELATIVE TO I KNOW WITHIN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THEY ARE DOING A CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE- AND I KNOW THERE MIGHT THERE'S SOME MERIT TO USING THAT FRAMEWORK. AND INCORPORATING THAT INTO THIS VERSUS CREATING A SEPARATE FRAMEWORK SO. JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW- ECHO- THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE IT WORKABLE IN THE SENSE THAT IF THERE'S A DOCUMENT ALREADY EXISTING- WE DON'T REINVENTED AND YEAH I KNOW THAT THE SENATORS WORKING WITH THAT INDUSTRY TO TRY TO. INCORPORATE THEIR BEST PRACTICES AND HOPE THAT CONVERSATION CONTINUES AND- CERTAINLY AS THE BILL MOVES TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THAT CONVERSATION CONTINUES IN AN OF THE CENTER WANTS TO COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL THAT WOULD BE MY SPECIFIC COMMENTS. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO'S SENATOR STAR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT. HE'S VERY BRIEFLY TODAY- TO YOU HERE NOW CENTER PORTANTINO THAT- WE WANT TO GET. THAT ISSUE RESOLVED- BEFORE WE IF THIS BILL MOVES ON TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE- WITH YOU I THINK WE'VE TALKED TO THE INDUSTRY ABOUT AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE ITSELF ABOUT- THIS NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS- WHAT THEY CALL THEIR- CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE SURVEY. AND WE'VE COMPARED THAT I'M LOOKING AT LIKE A SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON RIGHT NOW OF HOW THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY STANDARD WOULD MATCH UP AGAINST THIS TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES TASK FORCE AND THERE IS CLOSE PARALLEL OR DIRECT PARALLEL ON JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT HERE SO. MY INTENTION IS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TWO SETS REQUIREMENTS IF YOU'RE FILING THAT CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THAT WOULD SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL- AND SO. ANYHOW I JUST I DON'T GET INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL OTHER THAN TO SAY LIKE COMMITTED TO WORKING THAT THROUGH I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T GET THAT DONE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE BUT- HOPE BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN SETTLE IT OUT BEFORE YOU IF WE MOVE FOR TODAY. FANTASTIC AND AS I SAID YOU'VE BEEN REALLY PUTTING A LOT OF WORK AND YOU KNOW HAVING THAT SIDE BY SIDE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS IS IMPRESSIVE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE FIGHT THE FINAL DOCUMENT AND SEE THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOR. CONTINUE TO PROGRESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO SENATOR. THE. SENATOR EGGMAN THANK YOU AND- I THINK IT WAS A LONG THE LINES OF PERHAPS CENTER THAT YOU COULDN'T HEAR QUITE AS WELL BUT JUST THIS IDEA OF- AS WE'VE SEEN COMING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WITH OUR BUREAUCRACY SOMETIMES A STRUGGLING AND LIMPING AND TRIPPING- THAT IF FOR ALREADY IF IT COULDN'T CLEAN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WORKED IN WITH THAT SECRETARY STATES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING DUPLICATIVE THINGS BACK AND FORTH AND TO MAKE IT IS EASY FOR THE INSTITUTIONS AS POSSIBLE TO DO DATA SHARING. SENATOR STERN. WHOLEHEARTEDLY YES ABSOLUTELY SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MENU WE COULDN'T LAND LANGUAGE I HAVE FOR YOU ALL TO DATE BUT- I KNOW THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WITH AND ALSO THE CDI IS WORKING ON SOME WAITED KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT SUBMISSION TO SPEEDY I WOULD SATISFY COMPLIANCE WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE SEPARATE FILING WITH THIS IOS BUT THEN THAT THAT INSURANCE CMMISSIONER FILING AND THAT DATA WOULD BE SHARED WITH S. O. S- AS NECESSARY. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN SENATOR WESSEL. THANK YOU MISTER WOMAN AND- CENTER STERN FOR WORKING ON THIS- YOU KNOW I CAN FIND MYSELF IN THE CATEGORY OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON THIS BILL BECAUSE OF JUST SIMPLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE BILL IS GOING TO BE IS BEING PROPOSED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I MEAN RIGHT NOW OF THE EXPECTATIONS THAT WASHINGTON WILL DO SOME ON THIS WE KNOW THAT. SOMETIMES THINGS COME OUT OF WASHINGTON SOMETIMES THEY DON'T. AND REFORMS SUCH AS THIS OFTEN TAKE YEARS- THE LAST ADMINISTRATION I MEAN I REMEMBER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TOOK ABOUT SIX YEARS TO COME UP WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY THAT THAT WAS AN- OVERTURNED. BY- BY TRUMP. AND SO WHAT KIND OF THE YOU KNOW WORK FOR WE'RE BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED FROM ON THAT SIDE SO. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS COMING AS A PRESIDENTIAL. ORDER OR IF THE SCREEN COMES LEGISLATION BUT THAT COULD TAKE YEARS. SO I HAVE THAT CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE TRYING TO OF. ANTICIPATE SOMETHING IS GOING TO COME OUT OF WASHINGTON SO IF NOTHING COMES OUT OF WASHINGTON AT THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD ONLY OUR STATE CHARTERED BANKS WOULD HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT BUT FOR ONE SMALL AND ONE EVEN MEDICAL OR STATE OR STATE. CHARTERED BANKS AND I JUST DON'T SEE REALLY WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS IN THIS LEGISLATION AND THEN IF YOU COMPOUND THAT WITH THE PANDEMIC AND A STRUGGLING ECONOMY. AND EVERYTHING ELSE- THAT THAT THAT MAKES ME MORE WORRIED THAT WERE PUSHING LEGISLATION THAT COULD- THE- HELLO HURT INDUSTRIES THAT ARE ALREADY SUFFERING SO I HAVE OF THAT THAT ADDITIONAL CONCERN I ALWAYS OF ERROR IN IN THE DIRECTION OF MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE INFORMATION EXPOSING MORE INFORMATION OF PUBLIC I THINK THAT'S A GOOD ELEMENT TO THIS BILL BUT- BUT SELECTIVELY. ASSIGNING THIS LAW TO ONLY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THE CORPORATIONS I JUST DON'T SEE THE BENEFIT IN THAT. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO TODAY I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS I THINK MORE THAN LIKELY I THINK I WANT TO SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUES TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS. AND MAY BE- YOU CAN GET THIS BILL IN A BETTER FORM. OF ENCOURAGED BY- THE OPPOSITION TALKING ABOUT HOW THE MEMBER IS ACCESSIBLE AND WORKING WITH THEM THROUGH THIS AND- I HOPE SOMETHING. GOOD COMES OUT OF THIS IN A IN A WAY THAT. CAN AND MAYBE THE AUTHOR SHOULD CONSIDER- WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO COME OUT OF WASHINGTON SO THAT WHEN WE TO PASS A LAW THAT WOULD IT. ALIGNS ALL BANKS. WITH WITH FEDERAL LEGISLATION. AS LONG AS FEDERAL AS THE LEGISLATION IS IN PLACE I THINK THAT'S- WHEN WE REALLY NEED TO CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. FOR ALL BUSINESSES TO COMPETE AND TO WORK IN OUR ENVIRONMENT WE JUST CAN'T. CREATE SELECTIVELY SOME REGULATIONS FOR SOME AND OTHERS. NONE AND IT JUST DOESN'T ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO GET AT AND WHEN TO REALLY INFORM THE PUBLIC ON AND INFORM THE CONSUMER INFORMED- EVEN THE INVESTORS IN THOSE BANKS SO- I GUESS TODAY A LOVE OF SPORT TO BUILD AND MOVING FORWARD. AND ALLOW THE- THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY ON THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR WESSEL MEMBERS ANY ADDITIONAL AS A SENATOR THAT ASAL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FROM I ALSO WANT TO APPLY THE AUTHOR I HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION HERE ABOUT. IF YOU COULD JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COMPLIANCE ASPECT OF IT- AS I SEE THE ANALYSIS IS IT'S VOLUNTARY. BUT THEN BLAH BLAH BLAH OF THESE OTHER ISSUES THAT. MAY PUSH THE COMPANY TO DO IT SOME HI MOM MY CONCERN ON THAT SIDE ARE WE- PROPOSING THIS TO DO TO REACH WHATEVER IT HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S NOT COMPLETELY ENFORCEABLE AND IT'S A VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE COULD YOU. TALK ABOUT THAT AS A PIECE OF WHAT. YOU'RE HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN I THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO TO BE CLEAR THE RIVER THE REQUIREMENT TO PREPARE A- CLIMATE RELATED FINANCIAL RISK REPORT. IT THE STANDARDIZED REPORTING THEY CALLED T. C. S. D. THIS IS THE STANDARD THAT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND COMPANIES- GLOBALLY HAVE IT HERE TO- THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM ARE DOING THAT VOLUNTARILY EUROPE CENTER CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS BUT NON EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING SOME OF THAT WORK VOLUNTARILY SPILLWAYS AT WELLS FARGO AND BANK OF AMERICA- PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE BLACK ROCK SO. THERE'S VOLUNTARY EFFORTS UNDER WAY NOW BUT TO BE VERY CLEAR INDUSTRY FOR THE ALL. THIS WOULD REQUIRE THAT- THAT SAME DISCLOSURE TO BE MANDATORY- SO IT'S THERE THE ROBBIE IS WHETHER- IF THE FEDS ARE REQUIRING- THAT SAME REPORT DO THEY DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A SEPARATE FILING WITH- SECRETARY OF STATE I'M OPEN TO HAVING THAT FEDERAL SUBMISSION COUNT AS COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE BUT- YEAH I DON'T WANT TO ADD. THAT MISLEAD THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS A TOTALLY VOLUNTARY STANDARDS IT'S CURRENTLY VOLUNTARY STANDARD BUT THIS WILL BILL WOULD MAKE IT. A REQUIREMENT ALONG. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN A SENATOR CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WAS GOING TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF- MY GOOD FRIEND FROM MATT THE SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO AND BUT BUT I'LL TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND THAT IS THAT I'M IN IT NOT BE VOTING TODAY I THINK THIS HAS I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE SAID HE HE LOOKED AT MY NOTES AND JUST READ THEM AS- A MONSTER SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THE SENATOR STERN HAS DONE ON THIS. NO QUESTION THAT HE IS- HE'S ON THE FOREFRONT IN TRYING TO PUSH THINGS BUT GIVEN THE CONDITION THAT THE BILL IS IN RIGHT NOW I JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE MOVING IT FORWARD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR GAVIOTA ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. I SEE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AS SENATOR STERN I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON ON THIS BILL- I DO ALSO WANT TO JUST POINT TO THE ANALYSIS AND I THINK THERE IS QUESTION ABOUT. HOW ENFORCEABLE THIS IS SPECIFICALLY IF. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES ACT WHICH I THINK THE POINT HAS BEEN MADE WERE NOT CLEAR. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL ACT THEY'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS- AND CERTAINLY WE WANT THIS TO BE. AN EFFECTIVE TOOL- THAT CAN HELP CALIFORNIA LEARN ABOUT WHAT ARE THOSE. I RISK ASSESSMENTS- I OFTEN IN IN MY YOU KNOW PRIOR A- CAREER TO TALKED ABOUT TO EAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COLLECT DATA IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA USE THAT DATA. AND SO I THINK WE WANT TO ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS DATA- WILL TELL US AND PERHAPS. HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE IT- IN WAYS THAT- INSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE ADDRESSING CLIMATE RISK. SO AS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT TO- I DO APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS AND THOSE POINTS AND IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE. COMMITTED TO WORK ON THE ARE NOT NECESSARILY AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEES ASKING YOU'RE TAKING YOUR TAKING THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS- IT AND I JUST WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO CLARIFY FOR US WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT YOU ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON OUTSIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE. IF SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY. THANK YOU MANAGER AND CAN I TREAT THIS IS MY- CLOSE AS WELL YES YOU MAY. OKAY SO. FOR FOUR ITEMS JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET ALSO AHEAD OF. YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE STAFF SO WE LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU- THROUGH THAT- NOT SEPARATELY ON A SIDE TRACK FROM YOU ALL BUT- FOUR OF THEM I REALTORS BROUGHT UP AN ISSUE- A DEFINITIONAL ONE- THAT. WE ARE HAPPY TO MAKE- CHANGES TO- THE- THE BANKS BROUGHT UP. AN ISSUE AROUND THE CLARITY OF THESE CORPORATE ENTITIES AND EXACTLY. WHO'S IN WHO'S OUT WHAT A- CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE OF OPERATION OR CERTAIN LICENSES WOULD ENTAIL WE'RE HAPPY TO. ADD MORE GRANULARITY SO WE KNOW EXACTLY DO UNIVERSO VANITIES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ASIDE FROM THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A REVENUE ISSUE- WE ARE OPEN TO- AN AMENDMENT TAT WOULD- ANTICIPATE ARE BOTH FEDERAL COMPLIANCE AND TRYING TO USE. SEVENTY CFT FEDERAL FAINT FRAMEWORK AS SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE OR SOME OTHER WAY TO DO NOT HAVE DUPLICATIVE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS HERE SO THAT'S BAD BE THE THIRD AND FOURTH I WOULD SAY FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S PERSPECTIVE WERE ALSO- WE ALWAYS WANT TO WORK ON TRYING TO USE THE C. I. A. FILINGS FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. AS IF THEY'RE FIRED FILING SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR REPORTS- TO USE THAT MECHANISM AND NOT NOT ADD SOMETHING TO CLICK INTO SO I KNOW. IT'S A LOT TO. THROW AT YOU ALL BUT THOSE ARE FOUR ELEMENTS AND I WOULD JUST SAY IN CLOSING I SINCERELY APPRECIATE- GIVING. ME A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM TO WORK ON THIS I HOPE THIS BILL CAN MOVE FORWARD IN THAT WE CAN BRING YOU HOPEFULLY A PIECE OF WORK PRODUCT ON THE FLOOR THAT. REPRESENTS A STEP FORWARD AND SOMETHING IT'S NOT JUST A PIECE OF PAPER BUT THAT ACTUALLY DOES SET THE STANDARD BUT AT THE SAME TIME- I DOESN'T DEFERRED IT TO WASHINGTON AND- TO ACT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S HOW WE'VE PURSUED. CLIMATE POLICY IN CALIFORNIA HERE AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IT IS SENATOR MEANS POINT. BUT I'LL MAKE IT AGAIN BUT DURING. GET HOME NAM. HE BEFORE THE SENATE- THERE'S ACTIVE LOBBYING AGAINST THE BINDING MINISTRATION FROM ADOPTING THIS- FROM A NUMBER OF INTERESTS AND INDUSTRIES- AND THAT'S A BIG CONCERN SO I JUST. I FEEL COMFORTABLE AT LEAST FOR TODAY MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD WITH ALL THAT. WORK THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DO IT KNOWLEDGE- THAT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET WAY OUT AHEAD OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT WE ALSO WE NEED SOME KIND OF. BACKUP PLAN HERE FOR CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS TO DO THAT STRESS TESTING AND REYES DISCLOSURE THEMSELVES- THAT WE HOPE- PUTS US ON BETTER FOOTING GOING FORWARD. WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS STATE EITHER IT'S PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS SWALLOWED UP BY THE RISKS OF CLIMATE THAT WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL SO. SINCERELY APPRECIATED IN DEPTH DISCUSSION WE KNOW YOU'RE ALL VERY BUSY SO JUST WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ROOM TO WORK IN YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR WE DO HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT I WAS SENATOR WESSEL MANAGER JUST WANTED TO MAYBE ADD TO THE LIST IF I COULD ASSEMBLY. ON A MATTER THAT I BROUGHT UP- THAT ALSO INTERESTS ME HE DIDN'T MENTION. IN HIS ARGUMENTS HE SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MOVE THIS I MEAN I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT I THINK IT'S EARLY TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD BUT IF HE IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD- HE MADE ARGUMENTS IT WAS IMPORTANT TO PUSH WASHINGTON HAVE STATES ACT EARLY SO THEY CAN PROVIDE SOME PRESSURE. AND I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE AUTHOR TO COMMIT TO ADD LANGUAGE TO SAY THAT SHOULD. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THIS BILL WOULD ALIGN OR THIS BILL WOULD. GO INTO EFFECT WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TOOK ACTION ON THIS- SO THAT OF THAT POLICY COULD BE ENFORCED- OF. EQUALLY ACROSS THE STATE AND IF HE'S WILLING. TO COMMIT TO THAT ALL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. SENATOR STERN THIS. WOULD YOU LIKE RESPOND TO SENATOR WEST THOSE. YES FONT FIRMLY YES COMMITTED TO THAT. THANK YOU SO WITH THAT TO- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND- LOOK FOR MOTION FOR SB FOUR FOUR NINE. THE MOTION AT HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR WESSEL AND- CAN WE PLEASE- THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST THE MANDAN RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY LAMONT HI MON- HOTEL ABOVE. NO BUDGET ABOVE NO CABALLERO TWENTY. DALY BILL DALEY NOTE THE RUSSELL HI TORONTO ARE EGGMAN. EGGMAN I WITH A HIGH WHAT'S SO HIGH MAN HI MAN HI PORTANTINO HI PORTANTINO HI. THAT THE BILL HAS SIX VOTES IN FAVOR AND I WAS EXPECTING FAVOR. AND IS OUT OF COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR STERN. SENATOR MAN HAS THE OTHER BILL ON OUR AGENDA TODAY SB. FOUR SEVEN SIX. SENATOR MAN PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FELLOW MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR- CLOSE INVOLVEMENT WITH OUR WORK ON THIS BILL I JUST TO BE CLEAR I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS OUTLINED THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO TRY TO. FIND WAYS TO S. WAGE AND AMELIORATE SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS- THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED MULTIPLE LAWS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TRY TO REFORM THE PACE PROGRAMS- WE SEEN IT IF NO. CONSUMER PROTECTION ARE CLEARLY NEEDED AS UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS CONTINUE TO PREY UPON VULNERABLE HOMEOWNERS. SB FOUR SEVEN SIX ESTABLISHES TWO CRITICAL REFORMS THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE MORE COMMON CONSUMER ABUSES WE CONTINUE TO SEE. IN PLACE SOLICITATION AND FINANCING. FIRST THE BILL REQUIRES A QUALIFIED THIRD PARTY TO PERFORM AN ENERGY AUDIT TO ENSURE THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HOME OOREDOO'S ENERGY CONSUMPTION OR FOSSIL FUELS USE. A SOLICITOR'S OFTEN PROVIDE UNREALISTIC ASSESSMENT ASSESSMENTS ARE ESTIMATES ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY HOMEOWNERS WILL SAVE IN ENERGY COSTS. CONSUMERS ARE PROMISED ENERGY SAVINGS THAT MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE AND PITCHED UPGRADES OR UP CELLS THAT THEY DO NOT NEED. THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS INCLUDES THE STORY OF AN ELDERLY HOMEOWNER NAMED LARRY. WHO WAS DUPED BY PACE CONTRACTOR INTO INSTALLING AIR CONDITIONER AND TANKLESS WATER HEATER EVEN THOUGH LARRY IT HAD A SOLAR POWER WATER HEATER THAT WAS JUST A FEW MONTHS OLD. THE CONTRACTOR NEVER COMPLETED INSTALLATION AND LARRY WAS LEFT WITH THE CASE ASSESSMENT OF OVER FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. A THIRD PARTY AUDITOR WOULD NOT HAVE SUGGESTED REPLACING A SOLAR WATER HEATER IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION. AND THE HOMEOWNER COULD HAVE MADE A MORE INFORMED DECISION. ENERGY AUDITS ARE COMMON AND REQUIRED FOR OTHER ENERGY EFFICIENT PROGRAMS ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS INCLUDING CPUC SINGLE FAMILY AFFORDABLE SOLAR HOMES PROGRAM. AND ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AS WELL AS A COMMERCIAL PACE PROGRAM. THE SECOND IMPORTANT REFORM THE SP FOUR SEVENTY SIX MAKES IS HALTING PAYMENT TO PACE CONTRACTOR UNTIL THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR HAS OBTAINED COPIES OF ALL PERMITS AND FINAL INSPECTIONS TO VERIFY THAT ALL WORKERS BEEN ADEQUATELY PERFORMED. THE DENTAL PAYS HAS A HISTORY OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS REGARDING UNFINISHED ARE UNACCEPTABLE WORK AND IMPROVEMENTS SECONDS HERE CUT CONTRACTORS HAVE CHARGED FOR BUT NEVER INSTALLED. FOR EXAMPLE KPIX THE CBS AFFILIATE IN THE BAY AREA RECENTLY AIRED AN INTERVIEW WITH MELBA WALKER SOMEONE WOULD HIRE A CASE CONTRACTORS REMOVE ASBESTOS FROM HER BASEMENT. AS WALKER IS LEGALLY BLIND AND BEDRIDDEN APEJ SOLICITOR PROMISED HER THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD COVER THE COSTS FOR THE HOME IMPROVEMENTS BUT THE CONTRACTOR NEVER COMPLETED ANY OF THE WORK. MS WALKER HAD A LIEN PLACED ON HER HOME IN OUR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS SHOT UP SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX WOULD PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM THIS TYPE OF PREDATORY BEHAVIOR BY VERIFYING IMPROVEMENTS ARE COMPLETED BEFORE PAYMENTS TO PAY ITS CONTRACTORS ARE PROCESS. NOW WE'VE HEARD FROM OPPOSITION THAT THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR BILLS SO LET ME BE CLEAR THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO CRIPPLE PACE FINANCING. BOARD AND THE PROGRAM BUT RATHER TO ADDRESS THESE ALL TOO COMMON CONSUMER ABUSES. AND GIVE CONSUMERS CONFIDENCE IN PROGRAMS THAT PROMISE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND COST SAVINGS. WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE MAIN CONCERN AROUND THE ENERGY AUDIT. INTO PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS- FIRST WE ARE TRYING TO CLARIFY AS EASY A CLEARING YOUR COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES. THAT THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT WOULD BE LOUD LOWER THAN AND MORE NARROW THAN A FULL ON ENERGY AUDIT. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEING AN ENERGY UNDER UNDER THIS PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS. NOT INSURE THAT THERE'S AN AMPLE POOL OF ENERGY AUDITORS OUT THERE TO PERFORM THESE TYPES OF LIMITED ENERGY AUDITS. BOB WE DO NOT WANT SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR ENERGY AUDITS WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IS AN OWNER'S REQUIREMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT SOME KIND OF UP FRONT ASSESSMENT IS NECESSARY. FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THIS AREA. ON THE LINE TO TESTIFYING SUPPORT OF FOUR SEVENTY SIX WE HAVE STACY TODD. DIRECTOR OF UCI'S CONSUMER LAW CLINIC. IN ALL MARQUIS ACHE ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENT AND VICTIM OF UNSCRUPULOUS PACE PRACTICES. YES THANK YOU SENATOR AYE MAN AYE WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- FOR PREPARED TESTIMONY OF STACY TAPP PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND CENTER MAN FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THE SPELL I HAD MENTIONED MY NAME IS STACY PAT AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CLIENT AT UC IRVINE CONSUMER LAW CLINIC. WHEN OUR CLINIC STARTED I CONDUCTED A NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE OUR FOCUS. BEING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE GROWING RACIAL WEALTH GAP. ISSUE THAT CAME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH THE STRUGGLE OF HOMEOWNERS VICTIMIZED BY THE PAGE PROGRAM. SINCE THEN OUR CLINIC HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING HOMEOWNER SEEKING OUR ASSISTANCE. EVEN WITH A FOCUS ON REPRESENTING OLDER ADULTS WERE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN OUR INTAKE AFTER ONLY THE FIRST YEAR AND ARE STILL CLOSED TWO YEARS LATER DUE TO THE PROTRACTED LITIGATION NECESSARY TO UNWIND THESE COMPLEX FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS. BEFORE SEVEN SIX CAN PREVENT THESE HARMS BY ENSURING HOMEOWNERS HAVE CRUCIAL INFORMATION TO INVEST IN A FACT IT ENERGY EFFICIENT IMPROVEMENTS. OTHER CLIENTS ARE ALL LOW TO MODERATE INCOME WE WANT TO ENSURE A FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO CREDIT PRODUCT AND FIRMLY BELIEVE A SMALL UP FRONT INVESTMENT IN AN ENERGY AUDIT WILL PAY DIVIDENDS TO THE HOMEOWNERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE OPPOSITION HAS WRONGFULLY ASSUMED HOMEOWNERS WILL BE OVER BURDENED BY THIS EXPENSE. BUT THE BILL DOES NOT INDICATE WHO WILL BEAR THE COST IT COULD BE COVERED BY THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS OR WITH PUBLIC FUNDING AS IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WHICH USE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION BLOCK GRANTS. FOR COMMERCIAL. PACE ENERGY AUDIT. FURTHERMORE IT DIDN'T RESEARCH INDICATES THE OP ED AND ACROSS OF SUCH A PRODUCT. TO AUDIT FARM THAT THAT IN THE BILL'S REQUIRE. THE OPPOSITE HAS ALSO CLAY THAT THERE ARE NO ENOUGH. BUT AGAIN FAILED THE BUT- WITHIN THE BILL. OUR RESEARCH ON SIX TIMES THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMPANIES THAT CAPACITY TO MEET THE BILL REQUIREMENTS. AS WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS COMPATIBLE CERTIFICATIONS WE BELIEVE THE ACTUAL NUMBER IS LIKELY EVEN HIGHER. MORE THE BPI BUILDING ANALYST CERTIFICATE COMES AT A LOW COST AND THE STREAMLINED TRAIN. THAT NEW CERTIFICATIONS CAN BE QUICKLY OBTAIN TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND WE BELIEVE THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD HELP BUILD MUCH NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE ENCOURAGING MORE EFFECTIVE ENERGY EFFICIENT RETROFITS. AND CREATING NEW JOBS. ONE LAST NOTE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BILL'S REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE THE INTERCONNECTION OF SOLAR PANELS ARE APPROVED BY THE UTILITY COMPANIES. OUR CLINIC IS CURRENTLY HANDLING THREE CASES-INVOLVING CASE ASSESSMENT WHICH IS SOLAR PANELS WERE NOT CONNECTED BEFORE THE MONEY WAS RELEASED NOW YEARS LATER TWO OF THE THREE HOMEOWNER STILL DO NOT HAVE SOLAR PANELS CONNECTED TO THE GRID. AGAIN THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO UNWIND AND THE IMPACT DEVASTATING TO HOMEOWNERS. IT IS ESSENTIAL THESE GUARDRAILS ARE SET UP TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY FORECLOSURES SO OUR CLIENTS LIKE SEVENTY FOUR YEAR OLD ALMA FOSTER DO NOT LOSE THEIR FAMILY'S GENERATIONAL HOME. IT SEEMS A SMALL INVESTMENT TO PREVENT SUCH CATASTROPHIC KERR. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE. AND THE SENATE ARE MEANT FOR THEIR WORK ON THE- THANK YOU OUR SECOND WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS ADDED MY MARKET IS A RESIDENT OF ORANGE COUNTY IN A PACE CUSTOMER OF MINE.

WITH THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER LINE SOME QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MODERATOR WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL FIRST WE HAVE COLIN BISHOP FROM PACE NATION CALLING IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO START YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU CHEER THEM ON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS COLIN BISHOP AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PACE NATION. THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT WE ARE APPALLED AND DISAPPOINTED ANYTIME A CONTRACTOR TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A HOMEOWNER. PROVIDERS WORK DILIGENTLY EVERY DAY TO ENSURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN. AND WE SHARE YOUR GOAL OF PREVENTING CONTRACTOR MISCONDUCT BUT WE DON'T THINK SENATE BILL FOR SEVENTY SIX AS DRAFTED TODAY ACCOMPLISHES THIS GOAL. IN PARTICULAR I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON SENATE BILL FOR SEVENTY SIX UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE UNFUNDED AUDIT REQUIREMENTS. AS DRAFTED THIS BILL WILL EFFECTIVELY EXCLUDE LOW INCOME FAMILIES FROM PARTICIPATING IN CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. THE COST OF A MANDATORY AUDIT RANGING FROM FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS NEED TO BE PAID OUT OF POCKET UP FRONT BY CONSUMERS BEFORE THE PROJECT CAN BEGIN. THERE'S NOT A QUICK FIX FOR SHORT CUT TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM THE COST OF THE ENERGY AUDIT WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY HARM LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOMEOWNERS AND PREVENT THEM FROM IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND EFFICIENCY. OF THEIR HOMES. CLEAR TO ME CALIFORNIA'S CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS. WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK. NO ONE SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION. AND DESPITE ASSURANCES TO THE CONTRARY THEY'RE ONLY FORTY ONE BPI CERTIFIED ENERGY AUDITORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BY COMPARISON THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND LICENSED HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTORS. THE AUTO REQUIREMENTS IT'S LIKE MANDATING THAT EVERY CALIFORNIANS BRUSH THEIR TEETH PRIOR TO EATING AT A RESTAURANT WHILE ONLY PROVIDING A FEW HUNDRED TOOTHBRUSHES TO GO AROUND. IN SUCH A SCENARIO ACOSTA TOOTHBRUSHES WOULD SKYROCKET FURTHER HARMING LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS AND THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS YOU CAN EAT AT RESTAURANTS WOULD PLUMMET. THE AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FLIES IN THE FACE OF FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND RESIDENTIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY. OKAY OFFICIALS WITH EXPERTISE ON THESE ISSUES HAVE COUNSELED CONSISTENTLY AGAINST UNFUNDED MANDATORY AUDITS AND OFFER THEIR GUIDANCE TO THE BILL'S AUTHOR. INDEED IF ENACTED THE AUDIT REQUIREMENT WILL SUBVERT THE GOALS CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OFFICIALS LIKE THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THE NEED PACE IS A FINANCING OPTIONS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR BUILDING DECARBONIZATION WILL. WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU TO STRENGTHEN PACE FOR HOMEOWNERS. PLEASE VOTE NO ON SENATE BILL FOUR SEVENTY SIX UNLESS THE UNFUNDED AUDIT REQUIREMENT IS REMOVED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU AND OUR SECOND WITNESS IN OPPOSITION IS GRETCHEN WITH THE ADDRESS AT A HOMEOWNER GRETCHEN PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING X. COMMITTEE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU- THE A TELECONFERENCING MY NAME IS GRETCHEN GUTIERREZ I AM A HOMEOWNER IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY EASTERN RIVERSIDE REGION. WHERE I RESIDED IN THE CITY OF PROCEDURAL CITY FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS I'M ALSO A FORMER PEACE CUSTOMER HOWEVER I'M CALLING IN TODAY TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT BILL AS IT IS PROPOSED. LATELY MORE THAN SIX YEARS AGO I DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO MY RESIDENCE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE MY MONTHLY UTILITY COSTS. AT THAT POINT IN TIME I WAS PAYING ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN MY ELECTRICAL SERVICES NOT ALSO WITH- INCLUDING MY WATER SERVICES AS WELL AS- AN ADDITIONAL UTILITY CAUGHT. UPON REVIEWING IN THE VARIOUS OPTIONS THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO ME AT THAT POINT IN TIME TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO MY HOME. I DETERMINE THAT THE PACE PROGRAM PROVIDED THE BEST PLAN TO HANDLE THE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS AND RETROFITS TO MY HOME WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY CASH OUT OF POCKET OR MAKING A HEFTY DOWN PAYMENT TO PURCHASE THINGS. SUCH AS SOLAR OR NEW AIR CONDITIONING UNIT THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE FEATURES OF PACE FINANCING TO ME AT THAT TIME. HAD I BEEN CONDITIONED TO CONDUCT A FULL ENERGY HOT IT AND DO AN OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE PRIOR TO EVEN A PRE APPROVAL TO KNOW WHAT MY FINANCING OPTIONS WOULD BE OR WHAT TYPE OF IMPROVEMENTS I WOULD NEED TO HAVE. THAT WOULD HAVE- DRAMATICALLY MADE SOME DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED WITH MAKING THOSE VERY NECESSARY RETROFITS TO MY HOME. ADDITIONALLY THE COACHELLA VALLEY REGION. WHERE I LIVE IS A HIGH. YOUR ZONE. AND WE DO RUN A- AND HOW. YOU TELL BILLS OUT HERE. WE ALSO HOWEVER. HAVE HOMEOWNERS IN A LOWER ECONOMIC STRATA WITH OUR MEDIAN INCOMES ACROSS THE REGION. AND CONDUCTING A FULL ENERGY AUDIT AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE PRIOR TO DOING ANY IMPROVEMENTS OR HAVING. APPROVAL FOR PRODUCT TO BE INSTALLED INTO THEIR HOME TO HELP WITH THEIR ENERGY EFFICIENCIES. WOULD BE A NON STARTER FOR MOST OF OUR RESIDENTS- DAY JUST SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THOSE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO DO THOSE TYPE OF EXPENDITURES. TO CONDUCT AN ENERGY AUDIT IN ADVANCE OF INSTALLATION OF NEW UPGRADES. FOR ANY TYPES OF PRODUCTS WHETHER THEY BE SOLAR- AIR CONDITIONING UNITS WATER HEATERS. RETROFITTING OF WINDOWS ETCETERA THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THOSE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE AUTHOR HANDICAPPED WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF ENERGY AUDITORS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE CONDUCTING THOSE SERVICES HERE IN OUR AREA. WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT A NOT A MAINSTREAM METROPOLITAN AREA. AND HAVING SOMEONE THAT WOULD TO POTENTIALLY BE COMING TO US FROM OUT OF THE AREA WOULD DELAY ANY POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR. FOLKS TO LOOK AT- BRINGING THESE PROJECTS FORWARD IN THEIR HOMES- AGAIN WE ARE IN A AREA THAT. SEES EXCEPT THAT HE WAVES WE'D LIKE TO HAVE WORK CONDUCTED IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND IF WE HAVE TO WAIT WEEKS OR MONTHS IN ORDER TO HAVE AN AUDIT DONE COMPLETED REVIEW. AND THEN ANY TYPES OF FINANCING OR PROGRAMS BROUGHT TO US. TO DO THOSE. UPGRADES IT IT JUST EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM AND WE CONTINUE TO PAY OFF THOSE HIGH ENERGY COSTS. S. B. WE'RE GONNA STICK AROUND. BECAUSE OF THE TIME LIMIT. THANK YOU- SO IN INCOME I SAY B. SEVEN SIX **** CURRENTLY PROPOSED- I WOULD OPPOSE THAT BILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MISS GOOD HERE IS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THE GALLERY.

FIFTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. MY NAME IS CHRIS PETERSON I REPRESENT FORTY FIVE FINANCIAL WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE MOST AMENDED. IF THERE ARE OTHER PHONE LINES I'D LIKE TO STATE THAT- POSITION OF OPPOSITION TO THE SP FOUR SEVEN SIX. PLEASE PRESS ONE BUTTON ZERO AT THIS TIME ONE ZERO. I DON'T KNOW FOR THE LINES IN Q. THANK YOU MODERATOR NOW WE WILL MOVE TO MEMBER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR WEST SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW I'VE HE'S JUST BEEN THIS PACE PROGRAM JUST SEEMS TO COME BACK EVERY SINGLE YEAR- REFORMS AMENDMENTS IT JUST SEEMS THAT IT'S AN ONGOING STRUGGLE TO GET THIS PROGRAM. PROGRAM TO WORK IT WAS AS IT WAS IN INITIALLY INTENDED I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. SHOULD BE DATING BACK TO MY TIME IN THE CITY COUNCIL SAN DIEGO WE'RE TRYING TO. GET A PROGRAM GOING THAT WAS- PREVENTED BY- THE FANNIE MAE PROGRAM BASICALLY SAID THAT DECLARED IT ILLEGAL. AND THAT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE WE COULD PROBABLY. COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT CONFORM TO- THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OF COURSE WE CAME UP WITH THIS PROGRAM THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN REFORMED AT LEAST. TWO OTHER TIMES THAT I CAN THINK OF THIS PROGRAM IS ALWAYS COME THROUGH TO MY COMMITTEE SO- I'VE BEEN PRIVY TO ALL THE DIFFERENT REFORMS HAVE BEEN MADE BUT THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO WORK- WHATEVER HAPPENS THERE'S ALWAYS SOME LEVEL. OF THIS INHERENT CONSUMER FRAUD IN THIS IN THE CIS I DON'T KNOW OF TO WHAT EXTENT WE CAN CONTINUE TO AMEND THIS PROGRAM AND HAVE IT CONTINUE TO WORK THE WAY IT WAS. ORIGINALLY IN ENVISIONED. SO YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE AND NOW I WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORED MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD MOVE THIS ISSUE FORWARD. AND A THERE ARE DEFINITELY CONCERNED SOMEONE ASKED THE AUTHOR IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER- SOME AMENDMENTS AND- WE- WE DISCUSSED THE CONCEPT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER AND IT YOU KNOW BUT NATIONALLY WHEN. THE NET METERING FOR PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO A- A- A PUT SOLAR ON THE ROOF- WE PROVIDED THEM WITH A VERY ATTRACTIVE PRICE- USE THAT AS A AS A MEANS TO- FRIED SOLAR IN OF COURSE AT THAT IT'S BEEN A VERY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM BECAUSE PEOPLE. SEEN THAT BY ADDING SOLAR THEY CAN SOMETIMES YOU'RE FREE POWER. AND SO THAT- IN IN COMBINATION WITH PACES REALLY HELP TO GET THIS PROGRAMS TAKE OFF BUT- NOW. OFTENTIMES WITH PACE THERE ARE SOMETIMES CONSUMERS THAT ARE. I LEFT WITH A VERY VERY BIG DEBTS THAT OFTEN INVOLVES TURF. FIRST TO SAVE WATER AND SHOULDERS TO SAVE ENERGY SO. I'D LIKE TO IN IN MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS I'D LIKE TO OFFER TO CONSIDER. THAT IN SOME LANGUAGE THAT WOULD- AGAIN- I THINK HAVING THIS ASSESSMENT IS GOING TO HELP OF. TECH CONSUMERS FROM HAVING TO- PURCHASE MORE THAN THEY ACTUALLY NEED AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AT HOME HOMES BE. SELF SUFFICIENT THAT THEY DON'T GET SOLD ON THE PANELS ONE OF THE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING TO THE THIS IS THAT THEY'RE SOLD PANELS THAT EXCEED. THE LIMITS BEYOND WHAT THE HOME ACTUALLY NEEDS. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WAS EVER REALLY ENVISION ANY KIND OF PROGRAM WITH THE STATE. AND OFTEN TIMES THE COST OF THAT IS MUCH HIGHER THAN A PANEL THAT ACTUALLY SUSTAIN THE HOME. AND IT'LL SERVE EVERYONE A LOT BETTER TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH HOME IS SELF SUFFICIENT. AND AND- AS AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUBSIDIZED IN THIS PROGRAM THE PEOPLE YOU ARE USUALLY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE SOLAR. AREN'T LEFT WITH THEBILL TO ALSO SUBSIDIZED TO SOMETHING THAT. WILL LEAVE A HOMEOWNER HOMEOWNER WITH A- BIGGER BILL NOT JUST A DOUBLE CRIME. LIKE TO CONSIDER. THAT YOU ARE LANGUAGE THAT IN IN THESE REPORTS. THAT IT ALSO INCLUDE A RECOMMENDATION IN TERMS OF WHAT SOLIS HAD. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- THE APPROPRIATE SOLAR PANELS AND ENERGY SAVINGS PROVISIONS ARE TAKEN TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE WHAT THEY NEED AND NOT MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE IT HAS AN OVERALL COSTS IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THAT IS UNNECESSARY AND OVER BURDENSOME SAID WANTED TO ASK YOU A FEW BE WILLING TO DO THAT MOVING FORWARD NOT MAYBE NOT TODAY BUT AS A BILL MOVES FOR. CENTERMAN WOULD ELECTRIFY YOU SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES AND I DO KNOWLEDGE HERE- YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT CHANGES TO NET METERING WILL CHANGE THE ECONOMICS OF PACE PROGRAM- AND CERTAINLY AS YOU ALLUDE TO THIS IS A THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS HAD A LOT OF PRIDE IN IT. AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS TO ANSWER LIKE GOLDILOCKS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET IT TOO MUCH REGULATION BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ENOUGH CONSUMER PROTECTION HERE TO TRY TO- PROVIDED A MEANINGFUL CHECK ON SOME OF THE PIECES THAT WERE SAYING- AND SO I THINK THIS SUGGESTION YOU MADE WHICH IS SIMILAR TO SUITABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER TYPES OF CONSUMER LENDING. WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE APPROPRIATE AND I WOULD BE EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU ON ON MAKING THIS BETTER AND THAT'S SOMETHING I'D EMPHASIZES WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT- WE DON'T WANT TO KILL THE PACE PROGRAM WE WANT TO TRY TO CREATE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF REGULATION HERE BUT CLEARLY SOME LEVEL OF REFORM IS NEEDED- AND SO- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WOULD BENEFIT FROM YOUR EXPERTISE AND IT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION THE MAIN ONE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO. WORK WITH YOU ON- IMPLEMENTING AND STAFF THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. WESTERN NEXT TO SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR SO- I THINK SENATOR NO WAY SO BRINGS UP THE POINTS THAT I WISH OF PERSONAL ONE SIZE FITS ALL DOESN'T WORK IN IN CALIFORNIA HAS AS MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT. THIS IS THE LARGEST GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRICT IN THE STATE WITH VERY POOR PEOPLE. SO I DON'T I WANT YOU TO DRESS TO ISSUES THAT I THINK WILL BE REALLY CRITICAL FIRST OF ALL I HATE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO FRAUD OTHER PEOPLE JUST IT'S FRUSTRATING AND ONE THING ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE THAT I'M- NEW TO SINCE I'VE BEEN AT THE SENATE I WASN'T ON IN THIS FAMILIES THAT. I REALLY REALIZE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHER PEOPLE WHETHER IT'S CREDIT CARDS ARE WHAT I'VE LEARNED AND I'VE AND I'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF HOSE- BILLS TO GO THROUGH HERE THAT. PROTECT PEOPLE FROM. IS THAT NOT THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE NOT KNOWING THAT THEY'RE GETTING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO. THE PACE PROGRAM'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE IT DOES DO WHAT WE WANT IN SOME CASES IF WE HAVE GOOD CONTRACTORS. THE DOES WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO GET DONE SO I DON'T WANT TO LIMIT THE PROGRAM BUT I ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE WE STRIKE A BALANCE AND I THINK AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. GETTING ALL OF THE TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE MEETING WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO I'VE BEEN REACHED OUT OVER THEWEEKEND AND I APPRECIATE THAT. BECAUSE THIS IS A THIS IS A TIGHT ROPE I THINK THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO WALK HERE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. SO TWO QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED FOR ME IS. THE AVAILABILITY OF. PEOPLE DO DO THE INSPECTION NUMBER ONE I THINK IS. ANOTHER VISIT THERE'S NUMBERS ALL OVER THE PLACE FIFTY. S. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT- BUT IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR PEOPLE THAT. LIVE IN A VERY. GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE TRAVEL TIMES ARE HUGE IN IT WILL DRIVE THAT COST UP NUMBER ONE. AND THEN NUMBER TWO THE COST OF THE AUDIT AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- SO THOSE ARE TWO THINGS I THINK WILL BE CRITICAL FOR MY JUST. FOR MY DISH AND I WANT TO TELL YOU I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND THE REASON I'M GONNA TELL YOU THE REASON WHY. NOT THAT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL GET THERE AND I MAY BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT IS THE FACT THAT. IF YOU LAY OFF OF THE BILL IT HAS NO OPPOSITION AND THEN THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO WORK. AS A REPUBLICAN I DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT TO BUILD AND HAVE TO COME BACK IN LATER NOT GET WHAT I WANT I WANT YOU TO GET WHERE YOU'RE GOING. SO I WILL BE THE OPPOSITION TODAY THIS SAYS HEY WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS. BECAUSE I DO WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL EVENTUALLY. BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME CRITICAL. THINGS THOSE TWO THINGS. FOR SURE- I THINK NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND EVEN OPPOSITION BROUGHT IT UP AND- IF YOU'RE IN. BEAVER OR YOU'RE IN. L. A. SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO IS A WAY DIFFERENT WORLD OUT THERE TO GETTING CONTRACTORS. AND GETTING THE GETTING THE EVALUATION IS DONE. PROPERLY AND IN A IN A MANNER WHERE THEY'RE- COST EFFECTIVE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY THEN USE THE PROGRAM SO THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS TO YOU. THE AND COMMENTS. AND APPRECIATE YOU REACHING OUT. THANK YOU CENTER I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS I APPRECIATE YOU MAKING YOURSELF WILLING TO. HAVE DIALOGUE BEFORE THIS HEARING- I RECOGNIZE YOUR CONCERNS AND I GUESS I'D FIRST POINT OUT THAT. WE THINK THAT THE NUMBER SUBMITTED BY OPPOSITION ARE ON THE HIGH SIDE- OUR OWN ESTIMATES- STAFF AND SPONSORS OF WHAT THESE ARTISTS CURRENTLY CONSCIOUS FOUR HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THEY STATED THEIR ONLY FORTY ONE HUNDRED AND STATE OUR FINDINGS ARE. IF THEY'RE SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE ONE CERTIFIED RAIDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH HERS AND CAL CERTS. AND THERE ARE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT CERTIFIED THROUGH BPI NOW. I WILL SAY THAT'S ALMOST A THOUSAND THAT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH FOR THE SCOPE OF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WE ARE DOING IS WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. AND I WILL SAY WE'VE ASKED OPPOSITION IF THEY WOULD WORK WITH US AND- WE HAVE NOT HEARD BACK ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE CAN. TRY TO MAKE THIS A BETTER THIS ON REQUIREMENT THAT WE'VE SIMPLY BEEN TOLD REPEATEDLY THE AUDIT REQUIREMENT WILL KILL THE PROGRAM- I THINK IF WE CAN. GET IT WIDELY AVAILABLE AND LOWER THE COSTS WE CAN ACHIEVE THE PURPOSES. OF- THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO KEY WHICH IS PREVENT. THE CONSUME. FRAUD THAT WERE C. IN THIS IN THIS PRO. RIGHT NOW. AND AGAIN I DON'T THIS AS A THIS PART. PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS STATE SPONSORED BECAUSE IT IMPOSES A UNIQUE BURDEN ON THE- HOMEOWNER. IS ONE THAT REQUIRED TO HAVE A PUBLIC PURPOSE UNLIKE OTHER FINANCING PROGRAMS OUT THERE- BUT WE ARE LOOKING WITH. MANY STAFF ON WHAT CAN WE DO TO NARROW THE REQUIREMENT OF THE ON IT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A SOUP TO NUTS ENERGY ON IT HERE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LIKE A SUITABILITY. ASSESSMENT FOR A PARTICULAR PROPOSED HOME IMPROVEMENT- WERE WE WANT TO CLARIFY THE CRITERIA THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT WE ALSO THINK THAT. WE DON'T NEED A TRADITIONAL ENERGY AUDITOR. TO ASSESS THIS TYPE OF ON IT SO WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE. HOW WE CAN EXPAND THE POOL OF ENERGY AUDITORS AND WE WOULD BE EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU CENTER. AND ANYONE ELSE WILLING TO WORK WITH US TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS IS. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT PUBLIC SUBSIDIES AND WHAT PUBLIC SUBSIDIES MIGHT BE AVAILABLE TO FUND THIS PARTICULAR- ENERGY AUDIT. IF YOU ARE LOW INCOME- WE THINK THE CDC MIGHT HAVE SOME SOURCES OF FUNDING THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER PLACES WE CAN LOOK AT THE WORLD WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF. THAT TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU VOTE TODAY CENTER AND I WILL. HOPEFULLY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU. ONE ONE LAST. QUESTION TO IF I MAY. PLEASE ENTER- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN YOU KNOW MAYBE IN I KNOW THAT THERE'S A- IT'S DIFFICULT TO TRACK THEM DOWN AND BUT IF THEY'VE HAD MAYBE IT MAYBE SOME WORK ON THAT IN WOULD BE- IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. IF THEY'VE HAD SEX A COMPLAINT OR SOMETHING MAYBE THEY AREN'T ABLE TO USE THE PROGRAM ANYMORE I MEAN MAYBE THERE'S SOME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TO WEED OUT THESE. BAD ACTORS OUT THERE FOR THEM SO JUST SOME THOUGHTS I'VE BEEN THROUGH I'M I'M I WANT THE PROGRAM TO GO ON AND I REALIZE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH THE SITE I WILL WORK WITH YOU- AND I HAPPENED TO JUST IN MY OWN BUSINESS BE DOING SOME CHANGING OF- WHICH IS AN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS A GRANT PROGRAM TO CHANGE LIGHTING IN MY IN MY SHOP. IN IN A SIMPLE YOU CALL UP YOU GIVEN THE VOWED TO KILL WHAT YOU USE TELL WHAT KIND OF LIKE TO HAVE IN THE U. S. THIS PROGRAM IS I HAVE TO PURCHASE SUPPLIES FOR TO GET HIM INSTALLED. MYSELF AND THEN THEY GIVE ME A GRANT. UNFORTUNATELY HELLO OF PEOPLE THAT ARE LOW INCOME DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY TO. PUT THE MONEY UP FRONT AND DO IT THAT'S WHY THIS PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE IS. BENEFICIAL I THINK SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON YOUR BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND HEARING YOUR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY CENTER COMING AT ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- I AM I REALLY LIKE THIS BILL I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT PART OF THE CHALLENGE AND- I APPRECIATE THE- THE COMMENTS. FROM FROM MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN DIEGO BECAUSE IT'S THIS PRO PROGRAM. ABOUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGESIN THE PROGRAM IS THAT. IT IT IS TERRIFIC IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO- GET SOME REAL- REALLY IMPORTANT. SOLAR PROJECTS TAKING CARE OF ON ON AND FOR SOME OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE A HIGH ENERGY USES BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HOT IN THE SUMMER AND REALLY COLD IN THE WINTER. THIS IS A GODSEND BUT- BUT- IT IS PART OF THE PROGRAM WE DIDN'T SET UP. THE CONSUMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A GREAT PROGRAM AND BECAUSE IT WAS DONE. FOR GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS WE JUST DIDN'T SET UP ANY CONSUMER PROTECTION WE DIDN'T SET UP ENOUGH CONSUMER PROTECTION. OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT- PEOPLE OF LIMITED MEANS COULD BE PROTECTED AND BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM ASSUMES- A PRINCIPAL. PLACE OVER THE MORTGAGE OVER THAT. THE THE MORTGAGE AND THE TAXES- IT CREATES A SITUATION WHERE- PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS AND DON'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT IT HAS. ON CAN BE- TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND THAT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE I THINK THIS THIS BILL- CAN HELP TO FLIP THAT BUT- I ALSO- UNDERSTAND THAT IT DID THE AUDIT. DISCUSSION NEEDS TO BE NARROWED- I'VE TALKED TO THE CENTER SENATOR ABOUT THAT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. DOING A FULL AUDIT WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU NEED DOUBLE PANED WINDOWS AND INSTALL NEW INSULATION AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT. WHAT THE PACE PROGRAM CAN PROVIDE AND I THINK. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FUNDS IN DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THIS UP FRONT. SO THAT WE CAN GET REALLY GOOD VALUE FOR THE PROPERTY OWNER THAT'S THINKING ABOUT USING THE PACE PROGRAM SOME OF THE SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE GOOD SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR CAMBIADO SENATOR DO NOT SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I ALSO APPLIED THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL- WELL HE'S ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF. SPECIALLY POOR PEOPLE COMMIT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PROBABLY. GETTING SCAMMED YOU KNOW AT TIMES- IN ADDITION TO THAT I HEARD OVER AND OVER AND READ HERE DID NOT ENOUGH AUDITORS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S MUSIC TO MY EARS BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MORE JOBS. MORE JOBS MORE JOBS THAT PEOPLE COULD BE TRAINED FOR. MORE JOBS THAT PEOPLE FROM CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT CAN BE TRAINED FOR. AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING A CLIMATE ISSUE AND A CLEAN ENERGY ISSUE AND I'M- LIKE THIS IS THIS IS A NEW OPPORTUNITY- YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY GUIDE. THE HIRING FROM TARGETED FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHAT WE COULD DO AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GOOD WAGES AND THEY'RE TRAINED ACCURATELY SO WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH THE AUTHOR OF A PROGRAM THAT WE- SOME FOLKS PUT TOGETHER IN LOS ANGELES WITH THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER. IN THE ELECTRICAL WORKERS LOCAL EIGHTEEN. IT'S THEY CREATED A NEW UTILITY PRETTY CRAFT TRAIN ME PROGRAM- AND THEY HAVE RECEIVED- HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIP GRANT FROM THE STATE AND IT COULD BE A MODEL NOT MAYBE NOT FIT PERFECT BUT IT COULD BE A MODEL- THEY'VE TRAINED. OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY A PARTICULARLY FROM COMMUNITIES OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR 90% OF THEM GOT HIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER. THEY BECAME A JOURNEY LEVEL ON A WORKERS- THEY LEARNED ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFIT SOLAR INSTALLATION THEY LEARN HOW TO SUPERVISE WORK THAT WAS NEEDED- AND ULTIMATELY. THEY ARE NOW ON TRACK WITH THE BRAND NEW CAREER THAT WAS OPENED UP TO THEM SO I THINK ONE POSSIBILITY IS WHERE ALL WE COULD PARTNER OR THE PARTNER COULD BE A PUBLIC THE PUBLIC UTILITY. OF WHERE AGAIN YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE PROPERLY TRAINED- AND LEAD TO GOOD WELL WAGE JOBS AND- YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALSO ADDRESSING A SOCIAL ANNA AND THE COMMUNITY CONCERNS SO. I THINK THIS THIS LACK OF THIS NOT HAVING ENOUGH ENERGY AUDITORS MAKES HIM VERY EXCITED THAT WILL NOW BE ABLE TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN HOPEFULLY. I DON'T KNOW THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN EACH OF OUR COMMUNITIES SO. A WHOLE BUNCH OF THOUGHT LIKE THAT- TRIGGERS SOMETHING IN YOUR BILL THANK YOU. I WOULD SAY I WOULD BE EAGER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND HOW WE CAN- TRY TO. TARGET PEOPLE FOR THESE JOBS COMING FROM MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT BE FANTASTIC. THANK YOU SENATORS AND ALSO CENTER PORTANTINO. JUST VERY BRIEFLY I ECHO A LOT OF THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE YOU KNOW CLEARLY THE AUTHOR IS RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT- NEEDS REFORM BUT NOT TO BE DISSOLVED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS AS THEY PROGRESS OBVIOUSLY IT'S GONNA COME TO APPROPRIATIONS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OFFICE. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO. S. H. OBERG. HELLO- AN ICON YES OKAY GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF YOU CAN JUST GET A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOUR MICRO AREA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THANK YOU SENATOR MAN FOR BRINGING THIS- FORWARD I'VE BEEN AS A REAL TOUR HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW THE PAYS PROGRAM HAS EVOLVED IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND HOW IT'S BEEN AMENDED IN ORDER TO MAKE IT. A SAFER MORE EFFECTIVE PROGRAM I REMEMBER FIRSTHAND AND BEING IN IN OUR LOCAL BOARD OF REALTORS- MEETINGS AND HEARING THE STORIES PERSONAL STORIES OF THE ISSUES THAT HAPPENED SO GRATEFUL TO SEE THAT YOU ARE GOING FORWARD IN PROTECTING OUR OUR CONSUMERS I DO OF COURSE FROM A REAL TO PERSPECTIVE AND IN HAVING YOUR PRESENTED MANY MANY BUYERS. OF COURSE- AND KNOWING HOW COSTLY IT IS TO GO THROUGH THE- ONE PURCHASING A HOME AND A NUMBER TO JUST YOU KNOW THE COST OF MAINTAINING A HOME ONCE YOU OWN IT YOU KNOW EDUCATING. HAVING THE FINANCIAL LITERACY FOR HOMEOWNERS I ONCE THEY PURCHASED A HOME AND SAYING OKAY HAVE YOU PREPARE NOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. DOING THESE IMPROVEMENTS YOUR HOME AS YOU BY YOUR FIRST STARTER HOME USUALLY. WOULD YOU MIND INTERESTING A LITTLE BIT- WHAT YOUR GOAL WHAT YOUR VSION IS AS FAR AS THE INSPECTION COST- FOR THE AUDITOR IN EXPANDING THE POOL OF WHO COOPER. FOR FORM THE- AUDITS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE COST- TO SOMETHING MORE AFFORDABLE AND MORE AT COMPETING CONDUCIVE TO HAVING THESE ARTISTS BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS OF COURSE CURTAIL- PEOPLE'S OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE THE- THE PACE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO DO THE IMPROVEMENTS. THAT WOULD BE SO BENEFICIAL FOR THEM AS AS HOMEOWNERS- YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT PROCESS AND SO THAT YOU KNOW OUR- WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE MORE REASSURANCE AS TO WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE AND IN PROTECTING. THE CONSUMERS AND MAKING AND NOT A FINANCIAL BURDEN BUT A CONDUIT OF BOTH PROTECTION IN IT- VISIBILITY. I'M SORRY IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO HEAR YOU BUT AS THE QUESTION I AS I UNDERSTAND IT- WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT AND THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE AN AUDITOR UNDER THIS PROGRAM. PARTICULAR REQUIREMENT. YES AND ALSO A WITH REGARDS TO THE COST AND IF WE ADD YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT- THE STILL AT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IT. IT'S LITTLE STEVE. YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE COULD EXPAND THE POOL OF INSPECTORS IN ORDER TO CONDUCT THE AUDITS AND THAT HOW THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO REDUCE THE COST TO SERVE IT'S MORE FEASIBLE. FOR HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE THE LAST. THING WE WANT TO DO IS- THE FIRST BFI. BURDEN ON ON THE HOMEOWNERS RIGHT IN NUMBER TWO AT. THE TRYING TO REDUCE THE- THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO PURSUE HAVING THESE THESE HOME IMPROVEMENTS WE DON'T WANT TO DISSUADE THEM WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE AND INCENTIVISE YEAH. SO AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON EXPANDING THE POOL- SO THAT MORE. SAY HOME INSPECTORS ARE REGULAR HOME INSPECTOR TO DO THATOR IN H. FAQ. COMPANY WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. YEAH- SO FEW QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL TRY TO ADDRESS EACH IN TURN AND SENATORS MAN SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU AND I'M WONDERING ACTUALLY DUE TO THE TIME IF WE COULD- CLOSE RECIPES AND ALSO PERHAPS CLOSE AT THE SAME TIME SEEN NO OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. PERFECT HAPPY TO DO THAT SENATOR I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS. I GUESS THE FIRST THING I EMPHASIZE IS THAT THIS PACE PROGRAM IS NOT THE ONLY SOURCE OF FINANCING OBVIOUSLY AVAILABLE FOR HOME IMPROVEMENTS OR OR HOME IMPROVEMENTS. THAT ARE MEANT TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY- AND ALSO POINT OUT AGAIN THAT BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM IS SENATOR CABALLERO DESCRIBED- PUTS A SUPER SENIOR LEAN. ON THE CROSSES PROGRAM IT IS UNIQUE. AND CAN CREATE ENORMOUS COSTS FOR HOMEOWNERS IF IT IF THEY GET UP SOLD IF THEY GET SOLD SOME KIND OF IMPROVEMENT THAT DOESN'T HELP THEM- AND THAT'S THE FRONT OR TRYING TO ADDRESS- WE WANT A MODEST COST UP FRONT. I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER IN MIND I'LL SAY THAT. WE BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION'S NUMBERS ON ENERGY AUDITS ARE GROSSLY INFLATED- WE HAVE FOUND IN OUR RESEARCH THAT THE AVERAGE COST IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR ON IT. WE WOULD LIKE TO GET IT DOWN FROM THERE. IS A LOWER INTO THAT IN DOWN FROM THERE IDEALLY- YOU KNOW WE EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS AND THE STAFF TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE- PARTICULAR AUDIT REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE- BUT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'M ENVISIONING SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE. TAILORED MORE TO THE PARTICULAR SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS- AND MORE LIKE AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER A SUITABILITY. ASSESSMENT IS THIS RIGHT FOR THE HOMEOWNER DOES IT PROVIDE ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS DOESN'T PROVIDE. ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST SAVE IN THAT ARE APPROPRIATE THEIR SIX. SO THAT THEY HAVE. THEY CAN LOOK AT- THE GIVES AND REAL SENSE INSIDE AND CENTER POINT SHOULD. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GET UP SOLD INTO SOLAR THAT YOU DON'T NEED MY AND YOU KNOW THAT CAN ADD A LOT OF COSTS HOW DO WE PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING- AND THAT'S KIND OF THE GOAL OF. THE AUDIT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO ENVISION WOULD LOOK LIKE- WE'RE OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS ON THIS I WOULD AND STRESSES IS A MALLEABLE PROCESS AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT- SIMILARLY WITH THE AUDITOR REQUIREMENTS- WE'RE WORKING WITH STAFF RIGHT NOW. I'LL CONFESS WE HAVEN'T YET LOOK AT WHAT THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS ARE IN DETAIL ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO INFORM US. AS TO HOW THIS A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW GIVEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF WHAT WE'RE SORT OF ENVISIONING. I DON'T THINK WE WOULD NEED SORT OF THE SAME TYPES OF LIMITATIONS- YOU KNOW. WHAT WE DO INTO SPEAKING CHAPLAIN NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING TO CREATE THOUSAND DOLLAR PER ON IT. THANK JOBS AND WE DO WANT TO MAKE THIS AFFORDABLE. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AS I MENTIONED EARLIER INTO WHETHER THEY'RE PUBLIC SOURCES OF FINANCING THAT CAN HELP FRONT THE UP FRONT COSTS OF THIS AUDIT. BUT OVERALL YOU KNOW IT IT'S WE THINK THIS IS PENNY WISE- THIS IS. NOT NOT PENNYWISE POUND FOOLISH THAT. TAKE THE ATTITUDE THAT AN AUDIT THAT COULD WEED OUT A LOT OF FRAUD. YOU KNOW HE'S IS PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH THAT IS TO SAY. YOU MIGHT SAVE A LITTLE BIT ON THE FRONT END BUT GIVEN HOW MUCH. HOMEOWNERS ARE. STRAPPED WITH THE HUGE COSTS. THE CREW INTEREST OVER TIME. WE THINK IS A PRO. A AND- WE ARE OPEN TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN TAILOR. THANK YOU SAID I'M AND WITH THAT I WOULD SAY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE AND I WOULD EMPHASIZE WE ARE LOOKING TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY THAT THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WILL CONTINUE DOING THAT BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN AND THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR A ROBUST CONVERSATION SO WITH THAT TO- DO WE HAVE A MOTION.
