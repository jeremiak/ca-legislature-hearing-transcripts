UNTIL CERTAIN LIMITS THESE LIMITS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND DO NOT REFLECT INFLATION CHANGES IN CONSTRUCTION MARKET PRICING AND CHANGES IN THE SCALE OF PROJECTS. THIS RESULTS IN CHANGE ORDER LIMITS FREQUENTLY B REACHED OFTEN LEADING TO COSTLY DELAYS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR L. A. COUNTY WITH THEIR CURRENT PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS.

I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AGUIAR-CURRY HI AGUIAR-CURRY I. LACKEY AYE LACKEY AYE BLOOM. AYE BOERNER HORVATH. BUT I RAMOS. ALMOST FIVE. THREE OF US SIDE ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT RIVERSIDE VOEPEL RIGHT HI EIGHT ZERO HOW GREAT HERE THAT BILLS OUT AND THANK. YOU VERY MUCH I THINK ABOUT A MEASURE. OKAY WELL WE'LL GO TO ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TEN NINETY ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN WE HAVE TO FOR SUPPORT AND TO FOR OPPOSITION FOR THIS- OF THE- PROCEED SIR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. AB TEN NINETY ONE WOULD REFORM THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS VTA. MEDIA'S GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF THREE CIVIL GRAND JURY REPORTS OVER THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR. TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CIVIL GRAND JURY HIGHLIGHTED THE VT IS OPERATING PERFORMANCE HAS CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. RELATIVE TO ITS OWN HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE AND THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR AGENCIES. ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF METRICS. OF THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GRAND JURY REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION. MEDIA'S GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS A ROOT CAUSE OF THE AGENCIES POOR PERFORMANCE. HISTORICALLY THE BOARD HAS SUFFERED FROM A LACK OF FOCUS A LACK OF CONTINUITY AND A LACK OF RELEVANT EXPERIENCE. ALMOST HALF OF THE BOARD IS MADE UP OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO LIKE I DID WHEN I SERVED ON THE POLITICAL SOUL. ARE WORKING FULL TIME. SPENDING TWENTY PLUS HOURS A WEEK ON COUNCIL DUTIES ARE POINTED TO A HALF DOZEN OTHER BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. AND DON'T HAVE STAFF TO HELP THEM READ THROUGH HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF MATERIAL. TO BE SUFFICIENTLY PREPARED FOR MEETINGS. IN ADDITION MEMBERS ARE ONLY APPOINTED FOR A TWO YEAR TERM FOR AN AGENCY WITH A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. BY THE TIME BOARD MEMBERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE OFF THE BOARD. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THE SMALLER CITIES. AND THE GRAND JURY REPORTS HAVE NOTED THAT MANY BOARD MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE THE REQUISITE EXPERIENCE. THE GOVERNOR TRANSIT AGENCY. THE GRAND JURY INSTRUCTED VTA TO PROPOSE LEGISLATION TO RESTRUCTURE THE GOVERNING BOARD WHICH IS ENSHRINED IN STATE LAW. I WROTE AB TEN NINETY ONE WITH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IN MIND. AT A HIGH LEVEL THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE APPOINTING AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE THAT EXPERTISE. RELATIVE TO TRANSPORTATION. INFRASTRUCTURE OR PROJECT MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING OR FINANCE AND EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT. ARE REPRESENTED ON THE BOARD. IT WOULD EXPAND THE TERMS ON THE BOARD FROM TWO YEARS TO FOUR YEARS FOR GREATER CONTINUITY. IT WOULD REDUCE THE OVERALL BOARD SIZE FROM EIGHTEEN MEMBERS TO NINE VOTING MEMBERS. AND IT WOULD REPLACE THE ELECTED OFFICIALS ON THE BOARD WITH QUALIFIED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. WHILE THE BILL. WELL THE BILL REDUCES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BOARD MEMBERS APPOINTED BY SAN JOSE IN BY THE NON SAN JOSE CITIES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE BILL MAINTAINS THE CURRENT BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS. IT DOES NOT TAKE POWER AWAY FROM SAN JOSE AND GIVE MORE POWER. TO THE SMALLER CITIES OR VICE VERSA. HOWEVER THE BILL INCREASES THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS EACH SUPERVISOR WOULD APPOINT ONE DIRECTOR. THIS WAS DONE WITH THE HOPE. THAT BOARD MEMBERS WILL ACT MORE REGIONALLY AND LESSEN THE PAROCHIAL BEST INTEREST OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITY THEY REPRESENT. I'VE HAD MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL AT THIS STAGE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAN ANY OF THE HUNDRED PLUS BILLS. I HAVE INTRODUCED IN MY FIVE YEARS IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND I'VE BEEN VERY UP FRONT WITH EVERYONE THAT THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I RECEIVED A LOT OF GOOD CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. BUT WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO IGNORE THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS WITH THE VTA BOARD THAT HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZED. BY THREE CIVIL GRAND JURY REPORTS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR. AND ACT LIKE THE EXISTING STRUCTURE IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE OPTION FOR ETA. MEDIA WRITERS STAFF IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY TAXPAYERS DESERVE. A MORE ENGAGED AND MORE EXPERIENCED BOARD. SHOULD THE BILL MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. ESPECIALLY THE OPPONENTS. TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF COMPROMISE TO ENSURE THAT B. T. A. HAS ENGAGED AN EXPERIENCED BOARD THAT EVERYONE DESERVES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON A. B. TEN NINETY ONE. AND WITH ME I HAVE THREE SO NEIL WHO IS THE FORMER CHAIR OF VTA. AND COUNCIL MEMBER FOR THE CITY OF SANTA CLARA. AND JOHN MCALLISTER FORMER MOUNTAIN VIEW MAYOR AND CHAIR OF THE VTA. AD HOC BOARD ENHANCEMENT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR OF PLEASE THE HE HAD INCREASE O'NEILL. ALL WITNESS LINES ARE OPEN. THANK YOU SHARE ALL THEIR CURRY BIKESHARE LACKEY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN BILL EIGHTY TEN NINETY ONE I WAS A MEMBER OF THE VTA BOARD OF DIRECTORS FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ALTHOUGH I HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING AS CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE BOARD AT THE MEETING WHERE I WAS INSTALLED AS CHAIR IN TWENTY NINETEEN I MADE SOME FRANK REMARKS ABOUT THE CASE CHALLENGES. THE BIGGEST ONE WHAT THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THE BOARD I ASKED THE BOARD TO WORK WITH ME TO DESIGN A STRONGER BOARD WONDER CAN FOCUS ON THE TREMENDOUS TRANSPORTATION ISSUES AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND OUR REGION I CONVENE AN AD HOC BOARD COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM AND FIND A BETTER WAY FORWARD WE DEVELOPED A ROBUST FLIPBOARD ISSUES ENGAGED OUR OUTSIDE AUDITOR GENERAL TO HELP ANALYZE THEM. WE BOARD STRUCTURE THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES AROUND THE U. S. DURING MY ATTENDANCE AT TRANSPORTATION CONFERENCES I FOUND VERY FEW SUCCESSFUL AGENCIES HAD BGH BOARD STRUCTURE. THE RESULTING REPORT DIDN'T MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON CHANGING THE BOARD STRUCTURE. AS THE AUDITOR GENERAL FELT THE DTA HAD SO MANY ISSUES. BUT THEY WEREN'T SURE PUTTING A NEW BOARD STRUCTURE IN PLACE WOULD HELP. THE AD HOC COMMITTEE COULDN'T REACH A CONSENSUS ON RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD ON AN ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE. I BELIEVE THE AD HOC COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A POLITICAL PATH FORWARD. I STILL AM CONVINCED THE VTA AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. THE PEOPLE SANTA CLARA COUNTY WOULD BENEFIT FROM A BOARD STRUCTURES SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN AB TEN NINETY ONE. WITH THE SCOPE OF VGH RESPONSIBILITIES AND IS VERY LARGE BUDGET. WE NEED ONE VERY FOCUSED ON BTA. NOT HAVING BTA IS ONE OF MANY ANCILLARY DUTIES. FOR MY FIRST BOARD MEETING AT VGH CHAIR I WORK WITH STAFF TO PLACE FOR MEMBERS ON THE MANY VGA COMMITTEE. WHEN I ARRIVED FOR THE MEETING I STARTED. HEARING WHICH OF THE SITTING BOARD MEMBERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM VTA BY THEIR MAYORS. THESE INCLUDED BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE GOING TO CHAIR COMMITTEES. ONE OF THE MAYORS WHO HAD NO EXPERIENCE A VGA OR-TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. PUT HIMSELF ON THE BOARD AND HE WAS PLANNING TO RUN FOR ANOTHER OFFICE THAT YEAR. LATER THAT YEAR HE RESIGNED FROM VGA INPUT THE PRIOR BOARD MEMBER BACK ON. A COUPLE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS GOT TEXT MESSAGES DURING THE MEETING SAYING THEY WERE BEING ON APPOINTED ONE LEANED OVER AND SAID TO ME. HOW LONG IT'S BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH YOU AND HE STARTED TO PACK UP HIS THINGS. I SAID TO HIM WHERE ARE YOU GOING. HE SHOWED ME HIS PHONE WITH A TEXT AND SAID HOME. I DID SAID YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW I NEED YOUR PRECOCIOUS SHIN. AND HE WAS A STRONG VOICE IN NEED OF A QUORUM. I CONVINCE HIM TO STAY FOR PARTICLE SESSION BUT OTHERS LEFT. THE STORY REFLECTS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH VTA BOARD. I DON'T MEAN TO BE CRITICAL OF THE BOARD MEMBERS BUT THEY ARE EITHER FULL TIME COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE COUNTY SUPERVISORS. OR OR PART TIME COUNCIL MEMBERS USUALLY HAVE DAY JOBS AND IT'S VERY CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO GIVE VTA. THE APPROPRIATE TIME ATTENTION. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SENDING THEM BERMAN AB TEN NINETY ONE TO PROVIDE. BEACHY WITH THE BOARD. TO PROVIDING THE BEST. WHICH FOR SO VALLEY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISS O'NEILL NOW LOOKING FOR JOHN MCALLISTER PLEASE. I'M HERE. CAN I GO AHEAD YES YOU CAN. OKAY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE A WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD FOR THREE YEARS AS A BOARD MEMBER AND ALSO FOR YEARS ON THE PUBLIC ADVISORY BOARD I DON'T A LOT OF. INCONSISTENCIES AND- CANTICUM PARTICLE. YEAH COMMITTEE. CANTOR APPROACH WHICHEVER I NEED HELP AND AFTER WEEKS. FIND SOME WAY TO WE CAN LOOK AT THIS AND TRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK BETTER NOW AS YOU HEARD EARLIER THERE WAS BIG. PUBLIC COMMENTS ABOUT. THE REPORT THAT WE GOT FROM. IT CONSULTANT AND IT IS TRUE THAT WE NEVER CAME UP BUT THEY NEVER CAME UP WITH A RECOMMENDATION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ABOUT POOR GOVERNANCE. BUT WHAT THAT GIVEN. WE AS A BOARD THAT WE DON'T HAVE POWER TO CHANGE HOW PEOPLE ARE POINT BUT WE DO HAVE CONTROL OUR OVER OUR MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED. OUR APPOINTED WE FIGURE LET'S LOOK AT THE SELECTION PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. ON THE BOARD ARE ENGAGED AND INFORMED. SO. BY GOING TO THE THERE ARE THREE AREAS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I FIGURED THAT THE BOARD COULD ACTION ADNOC COMMITTEE COULD ACTUALLY WORK ON TO IMPROVE THE ENGAGEMENT ONE WITH ENGAGEMENT WELL WITH THE APPOINTMENT PROFIT. AND ONE WITH THE PAROCHIAL ATTITUDE. THE BOARD OF NEEDED FOR US- STAFF USUALLY PUTS OUT ABOUT TEN MAJOR POLICY DOCUMENT STRATEGIC PLANS CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PLAN. THEY SIMPLY AT TWO THOUSAND FOUR. IT CAME TO MY ATTENTION THAT A LOT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS NEVER FULLY READ ANY OF THE INFORMATION OR ENTITIES POLICY REPORT AND WHAT WAS THAT CONCERNED ME WAS THAT THESE WERE THE BASIS. FOR AND THE BACKGROUND TO MAKE MAJOR DECISIONS. TALKING ABOUT A- ORGANIZATION THAT DOES. HAVE A FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WORK. NINE DOLLARS IN CAPITAL PROJECTS AND YET PEOPLE ARE MAKING DECISIONS WITHOUT FULLY READING THE POLICIES THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW. WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE AT THE BOARD LEAVE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK EVEN THOUGH THE BOARD MEETINGS WILL CONTINUE PAST NINE OR PEOPLE WERE SAT THERE VERY QUIETLY. SO THAT WAS REALLY CONCERNING TO ME HOW CAN YOU GAUGE THEIR GATE. ANOTHER CONCERN WHAT THE APPOINTMENT. AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS EVERYBODY IS APPOINTED TO THAT BOARD EXCEPT THE MAYOR SENATE THANK YOU POINTS PEOPLE. SO IN THAT APPOINTMENT AS- ADAM NEIL SAID IF THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND YET AT THE WHIM OF A CERTAIN AIR SPECIALIST WILL POINT OUT THEY COME AND THEY GO AND SO THERE WAS ALWAYS CONCERN ALSO THE TIMING OF THE TWO YEAR ELECTION NEVER TIDY AND ALWAYS WITH THE ELECTION OF THAT INDIVIDUAL THEY MAY HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO SERVE AND POINTED TO THE TWO YEAR TERM. BUT ONLY SPEND ONE TIME. SO THAT WAS ALWAYS A PROBLEM TO WITH THE INTO THE ELECTIONS. LITTLE BLANK DISCOUNT. AND THEN THE FINAL THING KILLED ADDED TO. EVERYBODY WHEN THEY ON AND WAS RE MANY TIMES REGIONAL REDUCE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES ONCE THE SENATE WHEN THERE IS A GROUP OF EACH CANDIDATE ALONG WITH TWO BOARD MEMBERS FROM. BY THE STATE OF FOR MAJORITY. PLEASE WRAP IT UP MISTER MCALLISTER REFER. OKAY SO YEAH BASICALLY SO WHAT WAS HAPPENING A LOT OF TIMES WHEN MONEY WAS BEING ALLOCATED A MEASURE WE COMING FROM THE FROM THE BOARD THE MOTION WOULD BE MADE IMMEDIATELY NO DISCUSSION AND WE GO RIGHT INTO A VOTE. AND SO WE NEED PEOPLE TO START LOOKING AT PEARL COULD NOT PAROCHIAL BUT LOOK AT A REGIONAL THINK AND WITH MR BERMAN BILL THAT WILL ALLOW THE TAKE THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH AND GET BACK TO WHAT PTA REALLY IF IT'S A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. AND NOT SOMEBODY'S BACKYARD TRANSPLANT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MCALLISTER- ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I DON'T SEE ANY IT HERE IN THE GALLERY.

THIS IS GOING ON HERE. GOOD WELCOME. ONE LOOK CHUCK PERSON AUG YOUR CURRY VICE CHAIR LACKEY AND MEMBERS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HEARING OR TESTIMONY THIS AFTERNOON I'M GOING TEMPERATURE OF DJ BOARDING VICE MAYOR OF THE CITY CENTRE BELL ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FOUR. THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE PROPOSED BY AB TEN NINETY ONE IS UNNECESSARY WILL DO SERIOUS HARM TO BJ'S OPERATIONAL CONTINUED SUCCESS. THE CURRENT BOARD WHICH SAYS APPOINT BY EACH SO. AND SO AS YET UNNAMED TO SELECT CITY REPRESENTATION. THE CURRENT REPRESENTATION ON THE GT FORTY STRUCTURES REPRESENTS A CAREFUL BALANCE BETWEEN POPULATION AND REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. WELL NO SYSTEM OF REPRESENTATION IS PERFECT THIS BALANCES WORKS EXCEPTIONALLY IN PAST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN OUR REGION. CRITICISMS OF THE CHAIR ALWAYS TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND WERE JUSTIFIED ACTED UPON. OR BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSIST OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM THE CITY TO SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND TWO MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HE'S DIRECTORS ARE CHOSEN BY THE CITY GROUPS TO SERVE ON THE CHECK FOR. THIS RESPECT BOTH THE POPULATION BASE AS WELL AS THE MARKET REGIONAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE COUNTY. BOARD OF COMMUNITY SELF IMPROVEMENT. CURRENTLY WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A SERIES OF LOCALLY GENERATED IMPROVEMENTS OR PROCESS. I SERVED ALONGSIDE MY COLLEAGUE VICE MAYOR JONES AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE TO ENHANCE THE TEAM GOVERNMENT. WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN ONE DIVERT SO MUCH ABOUT. IN CONTRAST WAS LEGISLATION THIS WAS AN OPEN TRANSPARENT. I THREE GROUPS OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS AND THE PUBLIC. THIS IS UNLIKE THE LEGISLATION REPORTING WHICH IS PROPOSING A SOLUTION RESPOND REPRESENTATIVE. L. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE COUNTY I WOULD BE IMPOSED FROM THE STATE. IT ALSO MAKES THE ASSUMPTION THAT LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE INCAPABLE OF SERVING AS DIRECTORS. INDEPENDENT DISTRICTS THIS IS AT ODDS WITH THE MAJORITY OF TRANSPORTATION FIFTIES THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THE CHASERS PORTENT PUBLIC PROPS PURPOSE OF PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION TO THE TRANSIT DEPENDENT THE COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN. IT ALSO PROVIDES MAJOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AS WELL AS ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS AND BIKE SICKLE A PEDESTRIAN PROJECTS. WE GAIN VALUABLE INSIGHT FROM ADVISORY COMMITTEES FROM THE COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION PROFESSIONALS AND LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE GT FOUR HAS BEEN COMPRISED A MIX OF ELECTED COUNTY AND CITY REPRESENTS AND ALL VALUATIONS OF THE BOARD STRUCTURE INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY INDEPENDENT EVALUATION. DETERMINATIVE COURT CURRENT BOARD COMPOSITION. IS A VERY WORKABLE MODEL. GEN COUNTY IS FIRST HEALTHCARE CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDE ROBUST LOCAL SALES TAX REVENUE TO SUPPORT A TRANSIT SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE OTHERWISE UNAFFORDABLE OVER THIS LARGELY SUBURBAN BAR. DGA UNDER THE CURRENT BOARD STRUCTURE A LONG HISTORY OF PASSING TECH SALES TAX MEASURES TO DELIVER TRANSMITTED TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WE'RE CURRENTLY ENTERING THE SECOND PHASE OF THE BART EXTENSION INTO SILICON VALLEY. I DON'T NEED TO REMIND ANYONE HERE THE PASSING THE SALES TAX MEASURES TAKES A TO THIRDS MAJORITY. TO SHOWS A HIGH LEVEL PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN PGA. ACTUALLY ASK THIS BILL NOT BEFORE. HE CAN'T. TO IMPLEMENT IMPROVE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED LOCALLY IN DIALOGUE WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THE POTENTIAL CHANGES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR HENDRICKS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW HOW THE VICE MAYOR JONES. THANK YOU ARE CHEER AGUILAR CURRY AND PRICED YOU'RE LACKING IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY. AND FIGHT MAYOR AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CDSL DAY. I STRONGLY OPPOSE AB CA NINETY ONE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE OF SANTA CLARA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY WITHOUT APPROPRIATE STAKEHOLDER AND COMMUNITY INPUT. THE CITY OF SALE THEY HAVE BY FAR THE LARGEST YEAR NEARLY 70% OF THE ETA TRANSIT RIDERS THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY. YOUR PERCENT OF THE COUNTY'S RESIDENTS IN 57% OF THE CONGESTION MANAGEMENT INTERSECTIONS IN THE COUNTY. HUNDRED EIGHTY TO NINETY ONE THE CITY OF BELGRADE WOULD BE GUARANTEED ONLY TWO OUT OF NINE SEATS ON THE BOARD SHE CAN'T LEAD TO LESSEN THE TICKET CURRENT PROPORTIONAL AND EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION OF OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND RESIDENTS OF COLOR. EIGHTY TO NINETY ONE X. IT THE LIKE OFFICIAL WHO SERVED ON THE BOARD. HE CALLED FOR A. BOARD EXCLU ELECTED OFFICIALS UNDERMINED AGENCY THE TO THE PUBLIC THAT IS FUNDED. BILLION DOLLARS A. ORGANICALLY COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS TO IDENTIFY GOVERNANCE BEST PRACTICES AND EVALUATE THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE. AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD ENHANCE THE P. YOU CAN LOOK AT ME SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS REVIEWING NEARLY NINETY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THREE KEY BORGES IT IN EFFECT YEAH. WE DIDN'T FIND A SLEW THAT HEARING A BETTER GOVERNANCE. IN FACT AB CA NINETY ONE EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO OUR DISTRICT CAN BE WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCES THAT A NON ELECTED BODY BETTER POLITICALLY. CONFEDERATION OTHER CRITICAL GRANT YOUR SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT. BUT THIS AGREEMENT BUT THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. THE BILL CERTAINLY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE CORE ISSUES OF GOVERNMENT LINK LINK TO THE GRAND JURY REPORT. ACTUALLY WE CREATED CURRENTLY DRAFTING THE CORE ISSUES IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES YEAH BAKER THE COLDEST. HERE'S WHAT THE REASON. YOU VERY OPPOSED THIS AB CAN ONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS MAYOR HOW DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE LINE OPERATOR. FOUR COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO A. B.

CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN TO DO ANYTHING I CAN TO HELP OF WITH OTHER AGENCIES HAVE STRUGGLED- AND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- CLEAR GUARDRAILS ON APPOINTMENTS I THINK APPOINTMENTS THAT WE HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMPONENT- ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION COMPONENT- ARE ARE BETTER THAN JUST ALLOWING RANDOM APPOINTMENTS BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ELECTED I THINK THERE IS A VALUE IN HAVING ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES ON REGIONAL BOARDS AND I UNDERSTAND CURRENTLY IN YOUR DISTRICT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN MINE- PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE FULL TIME JOBS AS WELL AND SO SOMETIMES THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM. WITH DOING THAT SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT TO SPONSOR YOU TOO MUCH TO KEEP WORKING ON IT AND THEN WE CAN WE CONSIDER. WHEN IT COMES THE FOR. IF YOU OR SOMEONE BROWN AND IT'S THE PRIOR CONVERSE. IN THIS.

OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LUCKY. YEAH WE IN THE SPOKEN PREVIOUSLY I'VE- SERVED ON CUBA TRANSPORTATION BOARDS BOTH WITH THE- APPOINTED AND ELECTED AND I THINK THE HYBRID MODEL. BECAUSE I THINK BOTH HAVE MERIT IF DONE PROPERLY- I THINK THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS IS IMPORTANT. AND I THINK THAT APPOINTED MEMBERS SOMETIMES HAVE EXPERTISE. AND THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE. GREATER INSIGHT. BUT TO HAVE JUST ALL OF ONE. I THINK IS A- VERY DIFFICULT HAVE GOOD GOVERNANCE AND WHAT THE TRANSPORTATION BOARDS I SERVED ON HAVE HIGHBRIDGE. AND I THINK THAT THEY HAVE SERVED THE PUBLIC WELL AND SO. I'M NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT IT AT THIS POINT BUT ALL SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THERE THANK YOU. DID MITCHELL I AM GLAD I HELD OFF ON MY COMMENTS TO MS BROWN FORGOT BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS A WE ARE LOOKING AT AS A HYBRID IDEA- AND THEN MAYBE.

ALWAYS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. WELCOME IS MEMBER CAREER THIS IS NO. THREE EIGHT SIX THIRTY FOUR. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS WHAT A PRIVILEGE I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I'M ACTUALLY PRESENTING IN YOUR COMMITTEE SO GOOD TO BE HERE I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB SIX THREE FOR A MEASURE THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO EXTEND THE AFFORDABILITY TERM FOR FUTURE HOUSING UNITS THAT QUALIFY A DEVELOPER FOR A DENSITY BONUS BEYOND FIFTY FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA THE DENSITY BONUS LAW WAS CREATED AS A TOOL TO HELP ADDRESS A SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BY INCLUDING AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPER CIRCUIT GRANTED AN INCREASE IN DENSITY OVER CITY SUNTAN CITY THIS INCREASE IN DENSITY CONCESSIONS AND INCENTIVES ARE AIMED TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THE INCLUSION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CURRENTLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ADOPT INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE THAT REQUIRED DEVELOPER TO INCLUDE A PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON SITE OR PAY IN LIEU FEE TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ELSEWHERE IN THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER UNDER THE CURRENT LAW FOR DEVELOPERS SUBJECT TO INCLUSIONARY SET ASIDE REQUIREMENTS AND DEVELOPER ELECTS TO UTILIZE A DENSITY BONUS PROGRAM THEN THE AFFORDABILITY DURATION OF A RENTAL SET ASIDE UNITS UNDER BOTH PROGRAMS WOULD BE FIFTY FIVE YEARS IN SOME CASES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCES REQUIRE LONGER AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS THAN FIFTY FIVE YEARS FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR LOS ANGELES COUNTY FINALIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE WHICH REQUIRED THE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING SET ASIDES AND RENTAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO BE AFFORDABLE. IN PERPETUITY. AB SIXTY FOUR CLARIFIES THAT FOR THE UNITS IN A DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE. THE COVENANT CAN BE LONGER THAN FIFTY FIVE YEARS IF THE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE REQUIRES A LONGER PERIOD. AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY ON THE LINE IS AMY VOTED WITH THE L. A. DEPARTMENT OF REGIONAL PLANNING. THANK YOU. OPERATOR OUR LOOKING FOR AMY BURDICK. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS AFTERNOON AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO THANK YOU INTRODUCTION MY NAME IS AMY ABOUT ACT. I AM THE DIRECTOR OF REGIONAL PLANNING FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS H. AS THOSE MENTIONED AB SIX THREE FOUR WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SUCH AS THE COUNTY TO EXTEND BE AFFORDABILITY TERMS. FOR FUTURE HOUSING UNITS CREATED UNDER STATE AND LOCAL HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR LONGER THAN FIFTY FIVE YEARS BASED ON A LOCAL ORDINANCE. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS ACROSS THE STATE WHICH IS NO LESS ACUTE IN L. A. COUNTY. OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS L. A. COUNTY HAS TAKEN DRAMATIC STEPS TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTY'S UNINCORPORATED AREAS. THEY HAVE ADOPTED TWO LANDMARK POLICIES INCLUDING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRESERVATION ORDINANCE. EIGHT FIVE RIGHT HOUSING ORDINANCE. AN INTERIM AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ORDINANCE A VERY PROGRESSIVE DENSITY BONUS ORDINANCE THAT GOES BEYOND STATE DENSITY BONUS REQUIREMENTS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE MANDATORY INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE WHICH HOWEVER WHEN WE COMBINE THE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE WITH THE DENSITY BONUS ORDINANCE. THAT AFFORDABILITY DURATION MUST BE FIFTY FIVE YEARS WHICH IS THE LIMITS UNDER THE STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW. THIS BILL AB SIX THREE FOUR. BUT PROVIDE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOLUNTARILY EXTENDS THOSE COVENANTS BEYOND SIXTY FIVE YEARS PROVIDING A CRITICAL TOOL TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THIS BILL DOES NOT AFFECT THEIR JURISDICTIONS SINGLE FAMILY ZONING NOR DOES IT CREATE A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO ANY OF THE MUNICIPALITY. ALLOWING A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO EXPAND THAT AFFORDABILITY TERM FOR FUTURE UNITS FOR LONGER THAN FIFTY FIVE YEARS RESULTS IN A LONGER TERM AFFORDABILITY ON NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND ENSURE THAT HUMANITIES ARE ABLE TO PRESERVE THEIR AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK FOR THE LONG TERM. IT IS REALLY A SIMPLE CHECKS BUT ONE THAT WE THINK WOULD HAVE FAR REACHING POSITIVE BENEFITS IN STABILIZING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AVAILABILITY. IN SHORT WE SUPPORT THIS BILL ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL- AGAIN VERY GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC AND I YIELD. TO THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME THANK YOU.

WITNESSES WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THE TIME OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH. WE HAVE A MOTION ENVIRONMENT. SO I JUST WANNA CONFIRM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BILL IS ONE CITIES HAVE TO CHOOSE TO OPT IN RIGHT SO THE NUMBER NOT MANDATING ANYTHING FOR THE STATE CITIES CHOOSE TO OPT IN IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES LAW THE ONLY CHANGES ALLOWING CITIES TO GO AFTER- GO TO ALLOWING CITIES TO CHOOSE TO GO BEYOND FIFTY FIVE YEARS AFFORDABILITY. THAT IS CORRECT YES I WAS NOT THE FIFTY FIVE YEARS AFFORDABILITY WAS THAT WHEN I WAS ON THE INTERNET CITY COUNCIL WAS SUCH A WEIRD NUMBER SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS COMING THROUGH YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE I WAS I WAS TALKING WHEN I WAS READING THE BILL. YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T A BILL FOR REALLY US THIS IS A BILL FOR MY DAUGHTER'S CHILDREN SO ON THE BEHALF OF MY DAUGHTER'S FUTURE CHILDREN THANK YOU FOR. KEEPING HOUSING AFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK. IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMITMENT COMMITTEE COMMENTS QUESTIONS FACING NON ON ENTERTAIN A MOTION WE HAVE A FIRST BUT WE HAVE A FIRST BY SOME MEMBER RAMOS SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THREE OF US I WOULD YOU LIKE TO KEEP A CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING INCLUSIONARY HOUSING IS A TREMENDOUS TO THE WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS IN NEED- AB SIXTY FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO ADD TO ADD TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TOOLBOX TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES- TACKLE MY COLLEAGUE- OF MS BURNETTE **** BATH WE ARE EXPERIENCING MY COMMUNITY AND MY DISTRICT OF CHINATOWN- THESE COVENANTS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE LASTED FOR A NEXT MAN OF YEARS THT HAVE EXPIRED AND NOW THE CHILDREN OF PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING IN IN THESE UNITS FOR QUITE SOME TIME ARE EXPERIENCING A VERY SEVERE A SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL AS BEING DISPLACED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO I REALLY DO HOPE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A MANDATE THIS IS AN OPT IN. THAT LOCAL CITIES DO THE RIGHT THING AND ACTUALLY EXPAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THAT WE'RE NOT IN THE SITUATION CONTINUED CYCLE OF EVICTIONS AND INABILITY TO ACTUALLY FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRING THIS FORWARD I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE AND I MUST AGREE WITH US ON MEMBER BERNHARDT PARVATHY HELLO MY GOD WE WILL BE HERE BUT OUR KIDS WILL BE HIT WITH THE TABLE WITH THIS- I THINK THE BILL'S GOING TO HELP ENSURE LONG TERM PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE UNITS I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AGUIAR-CURRY HI AGUIAR-CURRY HAI LACKEY LACKEY. NARROW BLOOM. BLOOM I BURN A- BOERNER HORVATH I. RAMOS RAMOS HI LOU. THIS WITH I ROBERT REED. VOEPEL WILL TELL DEL IS. FIVE TWO. FIVE BOB HOPE PHONE BILLS. THANK YOU. COME BACK AGAIN SOMETIME. OKAY NICK WE HAVE I DON'T KNOW FOUR AND THIS IS A TWENTY FOUR SOME MEMBER FOR. WELL TO PROCEED WHEN YOU READY OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ON A PERSONAL THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL ALL OF YOUR HELP MUCH APPRECIATED AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR IS A REALLY A CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURE THAT JUST INSURES THAT CITIES MUNICIPALITIES DON'T PRICE GOUGE CONSUMERS WHO WANT TO PUT SOLAR ON THEIR HOMES I DID A BILL A FEW YEARS AGO AB FOURTEEN FOURTEEN THAT HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THAT DID THIS FOR RESIDENTIAL SOLAR AND IT'S BEEN WORKING OUT JUST FINE DOES IT IS A GONE BANKRUPT TRYING TO PERMIT TO OUR PEOPLE'S ROOFTOP SOLAR BUT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IS THAT SOME CITIES HAVE BEEN CHARGING REALLY EXORBITANT FEES TO PERMIT OTHER THINGS THAT WERE MADE ON SPECIFICALLY UNDER THAT ORIGINAL BILL LIKE- SO THE PEOPLE PUT ON CARPORTS- THAT KIND OF THING SHADE STRUCTURES A ONE CASE A SCHOOL WANTED TO PUT OR OR SOME BECAUSE SOME PLACE WANTED TO PUT ONE OF THESE BIG SOLAR CARPORTS OVER THE PARKING LOT. AND THE CITY AND THE CITY CAME OUT AND WANTED LIKE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PERMIT IT EVEN THOUGH REALLY THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THAT FIRST BILL OF FOURTEEN FOURTEEN WAS TO STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING OF THIS AND MAKING IT REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE SO THIS BILL JUST ALLOWS FOR THOSE TYPES OF STRUCTURES TO ALSO BE PERMITTED- OF FOUR OR MORE MUCH MORE REASONABLE COST AND WITH MORE. PREDICTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO PUT THESE UP SO ALLOW CITIES TO DO SAFETY INSPECTIONS AND SO ALLOWS FOR THEM TO EVEN ARGUE THAT SOMETHING'S MORE COMPLICATED AND SHOULD HAVE HAVE A HIGHER FEE STRUCTURE THEY CAN DO THAT IF THEY MAKE FINDINGS AND REALLY YOU KNOW ADULT THOSE FINDINGS- SO. WITH THAT I WOULD REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE INTO WE- IN SUPPORT AND LOOK FOR WE HAVE A MISSED BINGE. DAVIS WE'RE LOOKING FOR SUPPORT. YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM I HEARD YES YOU ARE. GREAT THANK YOU MY NAME IS BENJAMIN DAVIS I AM AN ASSOCIATE WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED SOLAR COMPANIES THAT CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THE STATE WE ARE PROUD SPONSORS OF AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK OUT THE BILL. THE MOST BUILDING DEPARTMENTS COMPLY WITH THE LETTER AND INTENT OF PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THAT AB FOURTEEN FOURTEEN WHICH THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CREDENTIALS BY OUT. I'M TED CAPS ON THE FEES BUILDING DEPARTMENTS CAN CHARGE TO ISSUE PERMITS TO INSTALL SOLAR. ADDRESS PREVIOUS LEGISLATION HAVE A LOT FOR MORE HOMES AND BUSINESSES TO GO SOLAR. NOT ONLY BY KEEPING THE COSTS LOW THE MARKET. HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW BUILDING DEPARTMENT THAT EXPLOIT LOOPHOLES IN THE EXISTING CAPS ON THE FEES. ARCMINUTES WELL BREAK THE FEES IN TWO PIECES SO THAT THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES ARE BELOW THE CAPS BUT THE SOME OF THE PIECES A CREEPY CAPS. THE BUILDING DEPARTMENTS CAN ALSO CLAIM THAT THE PURPOSE OF A SOLAR SYSTEM IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN GENERATING SOLAR ENERGY AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO EXCEED THE CAPS AS WELL. TO REITERATE MOST BUILDING DEPARTMENT FOLLOW THE CAPS- FOR ALL TYPES OF SYSTEMS BUT FOR THE ONES THAT DO NOT. YEAH IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO INSTALL SOLAR THERE. SOMETIMES D. EXTRA FEES ARE A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE I WHICH IS THE COST THE COST OF MORE- THE SOLAR COMPANY IS WILLING TO PAY. OTHER TIMES SO THE COSTS OF THE PERMIT CAN BE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS INSTEAD OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. I AND I CAN REALLY JEOPARDIZE THE ENTIRE PROJECT. SO WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE IT WOULD PREVENT BUILDING DEPARTMENT TARGET SPORTING PEOPLE POLLS. AND MORE HOMES AND BUSINESSES I WOULD BE ABLE TO INSTALL SOLAR- CAL. HAS HALF OF ALL SOLAR INSTALLATIONS IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE I WE HAVE A LOT OF SUN OF COURSE BUT WE ALSO HVE A HISTORY OF PATENT POLICIES. THAT REMOVE BARRIERS STAND IN THE WAY OF MARCH CALIFORNIANS GOING TELLER. I AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR WOULD CONTINUE TO REMOVE SUCH BARRIERS. ALLOWING FOR THE GRANT OF SELLER ACROSS THE STATE.

THESE ARE AGENCIES THAT HAVE SOME CONCERNS THE BILL DOES NOT DOES NOT REMOVE ANYBODY'S ABILITY TO PERMIT AND TO HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS. THIS IS NOT CHANGE THE RIGOR OF THE PERMIT THAT A CITY WOULD GO THROUGH THE SIMPLY FOCUSES ON THE FEES THAT ARE CHARGED. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE FEE SCALE TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT INCREASES SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE VERY MINDFUL TO MAKE SURE IT'S WORKABLE. BUT WE SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW PRESS PRICE GOUGING WHEN IT COMES TO SOLAR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU AGENCIES ARE DOING. BUT THIS DOES NOT MAKE THE PERMITTING MINISTERIAL IT STILL ALLOWS FOR SAFETY INSPECTIONS TO BE DONE TO MAKE SURE STRUCTURES ARE SAFE. AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CLARIFY THAT IF THAT'S STILL NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD BY THE COUNTIES. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO MEMBER BRING IT FORWARD TO CLARIFY THE PERMIT FEES THAT LOCAL AGENCIES MAY IMPOSE ON SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS.

BLOOM HI BOERNER HORVATH. BOERNER HORVATH I RAMOS. WELLS FARGO'S RIVAS THREE OF US I ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVAS I VOEPEL. HI EIGHT ZERO THAT BILL IS OUT- NICK THEY YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS A GOING TO I NUMBER. THE SINCE WE DON'T HAVE WE WANT TO HEAR THIS WILL BE AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM. AGAIN THAT'S AN ITEM NUMBER TEN AB. EIGHT THIRTY TWO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON AMENDMENTS AND THAT WILL BE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS TODAY. AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO IS A DISTRICT BILL THAT WOULD SUNSET MORE RESTRICTIVE LAND USE REGULATIONS CONTAINED AND FORMER REDEVELOPMENT PLANS AND HELP BUILD NEEDED HOUSING. REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES OR RDAS WERE DISSOLVED IN TWENTY TWELVE AND SUCCESSOR AGENCIES WERE CREATED TO WIND DOWN THEIR ACTIVITIES. DUE TO ITS SIZE AND SCOPE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DID NOT ELECT TO BECOME THE SUCCESSOR AGENCY TO THEIR FORMER RDA. INSTEAD GOVERNOR BROWN APPOINTED A DESIGNATED LOCAL AUTHORITY TO TAKE ON THE DUTIES OF A SUCCESSOR AGENCY. DESPITE THE DISSOLUTION LAND USE REGULATIONS UNDER RDA REMAIN IN EFFECT IN THE CITY. RTA'S MORE STRINGENT LAND USE POLICIES HAVE CONFLICTED WITH PROGRAMS THAT WERE CREATED UNDER VOTER APPROVED MEASURE JJJ- NAMELY THE TRANSIT TO ORIENTED COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT PLANS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES HAVE LED TO ONEROUS LAWSUITS AND DELAYS IN HOUSING PRODUCTION AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO WILL SIMPLY PROVIDE CLARITY BY SUNSETTING THE MORE RESTRICTIVE LAND USE REGULATIONS IN THE FORMER RDA. THE BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THE CITY CONTINUES TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER MEASURE JJJ. TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES. THE UNIQUE NATURE OF LA'S REDEVELOPMENT TO SOLUTION REQUIRES LEGISLATION TO REMOVE UNNECESSARY HURDLES AND BOOST HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CLOSER TO TRANSIT AND JOBS. AND LASTLY I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION. FIRST OF THE BILL IN NO WAY INTENSELY WIPE AWAY HISTORIC DISTRICT PRESERVATION OF MY OFFICE IS WORKING WITH HOLLYWOOD HERITAGE ON SOLUTIONS TO THEIR CONCERNS. AND ADDITIONALLY SOME ADVOCATES HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS OVER SECTION THREE THREE FOUR ONE THREE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THAT IS REFERENCED IN THE BILL. AND I'LL BE REMOVING THE REFERENCE TO SECTION THREE THREE FOUR ONE THREE FROM THE BILL AND WE'LL DO THOSE AMENDMENTS ON THE FLOOR WHERE THE BILL IS HEADED NEXT SHOULD BE. FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GATHER A MAJORITY OF US TODAY. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OUR GREG BULLOCK PLANNING DIRECTOR FOR THE OFFICE OF COUNCILMEMBER MITCH O'FARRELL THANK YOU GREAT- WELCOME MR BOUGHT UP RAIDERS WERE LOOKING FOR CRAIG BULLOCK. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CRAIG BALKENENDE PLANNING DIRECTOR FOR COUNCILMEMBER MITCH O'FARRELL. PRIOR TO JOINING COUNTS MEMBER OF PERILS OFFICE I WORKED FOR FIVE YEARS FOR THE C. R. A. L. A. A DESIGNATED LOCAL AUTHORITY AND SUCCESSOR AGENCY TO THE FORMER COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY AT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. PRIOR TO THAT I WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY AT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR EIGHT YEARS. MY RESPONSIBILITIES THERE INCLUDED THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAND USE AUTHORITIES OF THE REAL OF THESE REDEVELOPMENT PLANS. I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLAME FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MULTIPLE REDEVELOPMENT PLANS AND LOS ANGELES ARE SERIOUS AND HAVE BEEN OBSTACLES IN CREATING HOUSING. ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE DISSOLVED NEARLY A DECADE AGO WE CONTINUE TO BE HAMPERED BY THEIR OUTDATED REQUIREMENTS. SUCH HINDRANCES INCLUDE MORE RESTRICTIVE DENSITY AND THAT THEY ARE LIMITATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY PLANS AND ZONING. THEY PREVENT THE USE OF THE CITY'S TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES PROGRAM A VOTER APPROVED AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES GREATER DENSITY. THAN THE STATE DENSITY PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IT ALSO INCLUDES THE MUCH NEEDED. EXTREMELY LOW INCOME CATEGORY. THREE PLAN OF ALL BEEN A SORE OF BALD LOS. WHICH HAVE SLOWED HOUSING PRODUCTION INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IN TURN HAS INCREASED COST OF HOUSING AND ONE OF THE STATE'S MOST EXPENSIVEHOUSING MARKETS. DID BETTER EXAMPLES EXIST IN A LITIGATION FILED AGAINST THEM ON A CO A 100% AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN HOLLYWOOD. IN ADDITION PASSED THERE WAS HOLLYWOOD A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECT WAS ALSO LITIGATED AGAINST USING THE HOLLYWOOD REDEVELOPMENT PLAN AS THE BASIS OF THE LITIGATION. THE DELAY HAS INCREASED THE COST OF THE POLICY THOUGH BY TWELVE PERCENT. CLAIMS AGAINST THE BILL IN LARGE PART ARE BEING MADE BY INDIVIDUALS AND PARTIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLAINTIFFS THAT HAVE A HISTORY OF FILING LITIGATION AGAINST THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY THE SUCCESSOR AGENCY AND THE CITY. IN THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS THAT LITIGATION HAS INVOLVED THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF HOUSING. INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF UNITS BEFORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH AN INFILL DEVELOPMENTS. IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PROTECTIONS OF HISTORIC RESOURCES FOUND IN THE REDEVELOPMENT PLANS WILL NOT BE REMOVED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL. HISTORIC RESOURCE PROTECTIONS ARE BEING INCORPORATED INTO THE CITY'S NEWLY ADOPTED COMMUNITY PLANS WHICH ARE BEING UPDATED RIGHT NOW THESE PROTECTIONS WILL BE IN PLACE LONG AFTER THE PROTECTIONS OF THE CURRENT REDEVELOPMENT PLANS EXPIRE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM'S OFFICE. TO RESOLVE ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES. THIS IS A TIME TO THIS. THE REMAINING REDEVELOPMENT PLANS HAVE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN AGENCY THAT THE STATE TO SOLVE NEARLY A DECADE AGO. NOW THE SAME PLANS WHICH WERE CREATED TO REMOVE BLIGHT AND CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAVE BEEN WEAPONIZED AGAINST THOSE OBJECTIVES. THIS BILL WOULD GREATLY ADVANCE OUR EFFORTS TO MEET OUR CURRENT NEEDS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BORK- ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF C.

IN THOSE REDEVELOPMENT PLAN AREAS HAVE SOME ASSURANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WILL BE AVAILABLE- IT WOULD IT WOULD PUT THE CITY IN A POSITION NO LONGER NEEDING TO PAY ATTENTION TO LOW INCOME HOUSING- IN THOSE PLAN AREAS A TIME THAT LA HAS THE HIGHEST HOMELESS RATE- IN THE STATE AND THE 30% OF ANGELENOS ARE PAYING MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT OF YOUR PORTAL HOUSING NEED IN LOS ANGELES IS GREAT AS IT IS ACROSS THIS ACROSS THE STATE. AND WILL TAKE EVERY EFFORT TO MEET THAT NEED NOW IS NOT THAT WOULD NOT BE THE TIME TO RETREAT FROM THE RETREAT FROM ANY OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME CITIZENS WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS THAT AYE MR BLOOM WILL BE PRESENTING- AS THE BILL MOVES TO THE FLOOR AND LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING OUR POSITION AT THAT TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH.

I RESEARCH THE LAST FEW WEEKS FOUND THAT JUST. ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR JURISDICTIONS. ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW WHEN IT COMES TO STREAMLINING. PERMITTING AND THIS BILL. WILL FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE TO MAKE SURE WE CAN RESOLVE. THESE ISSUES THAT WE MUST TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO BUILD OUT CHARGING STATION INFRASTRUCTURE. NECESSARY TO SUPPORT EV'S. AND TO MEET OUR AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE GOALS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I THINK THIS BILL DOES THAT. IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THESE THINGS WILL BE BUILT IT JUST WITH- MOTIVATE. I JURISDICTIONS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THAT THEY DO DRAG THEIR FEET IT WOULD SET SOME. TIME LINES FOR. A SWIFT ACTION AS FAR AS COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICATIONS FOR THESE TV CHARGING STATIONS.

HAVE ALL FAILED TO ACHIEVE. NATIONALLY REQUIRED. AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. AND WE SEE EVERY DAY THE EFFECTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS WITH WILDFIRES. DROUGHT HEAT WAVES AND RISING SEA LEVEL. THE GOOD NEWS IS- THAT WE HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF THE EMISSIONS THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF EMISSIONS THAT CAUSE AIR POLLUTION AND pTRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND WE CAN CLEAN THAT UP BY ELECTRIFY. OUR VEHICLES ARE CARS TRUCKS AND BUSES- AND BECAUSE OF THAT. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE- NEED TO HAVE WIDESPREAD ACCESSIBLE. CONVENIENT CHARGING. IN ORDER TO ELECTRIFY TRANSPORTATION. AND THE LEGISLATURE SAW. THAT NEED AND IN TWENTY FIFTH. PASSED AB TWO THIRTY SO BY SOME WE MAY DAVID CHIU ROCK. LOCAL TO. THE PERMITTING FOR. ON WE HAVEN'T BEEN KEEPING UP WE HAVE A CHARGING GAP THE ENERGY COMMISSION ESTIMATES THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WILL BE SHORT SIXTY TWO THOUSAND. CHARGERS AT OUR CURRENT RATE. AND WITHOUT THERE'S A LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH AB TWELVE THIRTY SIX. GOBIZ WHICH HAD A GOAL OF A 100% COMPLIANCE BY EARTH DAY OF LAST MONTH.

HERE IN CALIFORNIA OPERATIONAL TODAY. CALIFORNIA'S EVEY CHARGING STATION CARMEN IN LAW ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBER CHOOSE AB TWELVE THIRTY SIX. IT IS THE STRONGEST EVEY PERMIT EXPEDITING LAW IN THE NATION. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT FOLLOWED AND IT'S NOT ENFORCED. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE AVERAGE TIME TO COMPLETE THE PERMITTING PROCESS FOR A DC FAST CHARGING STATIONS. IN CALIFORNIA ROSE FROM SEVENTY FIVE BUSINESS DAYS TO SEVENTY SEVEN BUSINESS DAYS. MAKING THAT 38% LONGER THAN OUR NATIONAL AVERAGE. PERMITTING PROCESS HE'S ALSO RESULT IN STATION SITE SITES BEING REDESIGNED MORE FREQUENTLY IN CALIFORNIA THAN THE REST OF THE NATION. WHICH INCREASES COSTS AND LEADS TO DELAYS. IN INC. IT COSTS ELECTRIFY AMERICA ABOUT AND CONSTRUCT A STATION IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS EXACTLY THE SAME FEATURES EXACTLY THE SAME NUMBER OF CHARGERS WHEN COMPARED TO ANY OTHER STATE. THE HIGHER COSTS PER STATION ULTIMATELY MEAN THAT CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE FEWER STATIONS PER DOLLAR INVESTED BY ELECTRIFY AMERICA AND EVERY OTHER INVESTOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. ADDITIONALLY AS AS BILL JUST MENTIONED A REVIEW BY GOVERNOR'S MEANS THAT INDONESIAN STAFF I GO THIS IS FOUND THAT ONLY 2524225% OF CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS ARE COMPLYING WITH AB TWELVE THIRTY SIX.

GOBIZ MOP OR READ BOTH CITY MANAGERS WERE LIKE OH SORRY WE CAN FIX THIS NOW- SO I DO THINK THERE IS A MESS I DISAGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT THIS IS UNTENABLE I SPOKE WITH- THE ONE OF THE- PLANNING OFFICERS AND SEND IT IS. ANY SAID GENERALLY WE DO IT WITHOUT THE STREAMLINING BUT WE GENERALLY PROVE THEM ON THE BUILDING PERMIT SIDE- WITHIN THIRTY DAYS SO COMPLYING WITH THIS THE BILL WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE A PROBLEM FOR EITHER OF THE TWO CITIES. SO I THINK IT IS GOOD THAT WE BRING IT FORWARD- WE DO NEED EASY FAST CHARGING NETWORKS AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM OUR CONVERSATION THAT IF THE CITY NEEDS TO HAVE LIKE A DO A TRAFFIC ANALYSIS THEY HAVE THOSE FIVE DAYS TO DO A COMPLETE AND TWENTY DAYS. TO MAKE THOSE FINDINGS TO THE TO HAVE THE FURTHER ANALYSIS. CORRECT IT. GOOD YEAH EVEN. IT JUST SAYS IF THE- SITS THERE. FOR FIVE DAYS AND YOU DON'T RESPOND THE APPLICATIONS A COMPLETE APPLICATION AND THEN THERE'S TWENTY DAYS TO REVIEW IT SO THAT TWENTY DAYS IF THEY SIDE VIEW WE ADDRESS SOME PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. THEN THEY CAN TRIGGER EVEN MORE TIME TO DO THAT WORK THEY JUST CAN'T SIT ON IT FOR THAT TIME YEAH SO I THINK IT'S IS- REASONABLE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SO MUCH SUPPORT THERE WAS SOME OPPOSITE FROM THE SMALLER CITIES AND I THINK WITH THE AMENDMENTS FOR. GIVING THEM MORE TIME TO DO SO IN MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE DOING THIS AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY COSTLY BECAUSE THE DEVELOPERS ASK YOU COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU PAY IT OUT YOU PAY A FEE SO THESE ARE FEE BASED PROGRAM IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND. ALL PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT AS THE PLANNING FEE AND THAT GOES TO PAY FOR THE FOR THE SERVICES FOR THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AS WELL YES SO I THINK MY CITIES WILL BE COMPLYING AHEAD OF THIS BILL GETTING OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THROUGH THE SENATE TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DESK.

OKAY LET'S WELCOME ITEM NUMBER NINE AB SEVEN SUPPOSED TO USE ME THANKS AB EIGHT NINE FIVE NINE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. I GOT AHEAD OF MYSELF MISTER MULLIN. THANK YOU GOVERNOR WELCOME. M. MEMBERS PRESENTING. AB DIED FIFTY NINE THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR A START UP BY SEVEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS OUTLINED IN COMMON NUMBER SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE MEASURE AB KNIFE IT DID I WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW INDEPENDENT PARK DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS A MULTITUDE OF PUBLIC NUISANCES. THAT THEY CONFRONT REGULARLY SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD GIVE THE STATE'S FOR INDEPENDENT PARK DISTRICT'S PUBLIC NUISANCE ABATEMENT AUTHORITY WITHIN ITS PRINCIPAL ACTS SIMILAR TO A CITY OR COUNTY'S ABILITY SPECIFICALLY THE PARK DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DECLARE BY ORDINANCE WHAT CONSTITUTES A PUBLIC NUISANCE THE AUTHORITY TO ABATE THOSE PUBLIC NUISANCES BY EITHER ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL ACTIONS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS COSTS INCURRED IN ABATING THE PUBLIC NUISANCE INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PARK DISTRICT STAFF TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS ILLEGAL ENCROACHMENTS ON A PARK DISTRICTS PROPERTY WITHOUT A FULL SET OF TOOLS AT THE PARK DISTRICTS DISPOSAL THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE PUBLIC LANDS ARE NOT GETTING THE PROTECTION THEY NEED EXAMPLES OF THESE NUISANCES- CAN RUN THROUGH UP A LEGAL WATER DIVERSION EXTENSION OF YARDS IN A PARK HABITAT ILLEGAL DUMPING AND GRADING ON AUTHORIZED LANDSCAPING AND LEGAL- STREAMBED ALTERATION ALL OF WHICH MAY IMPACT SENSITIVE HABITAT WILDFIRE PROTECTION ZONES. AND OTHER PARK SPECIFIC USES THESE DISTRICTS UP NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ILLEGAL ENCROACHMENTS IN THE SAME COMPREHENSIVE WAY THE OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES DO AS WELL- GIVEN THAT PURCHASERS ARE BEST SUITED TO ADDRESS LAND STEWARDSHIP AND MANAGEMENT ISSUES ON ITS OWN LANDS PROVIDING PARK DISTRICTS WITH THE APPROPRIATE ABATEMENT TOOLS WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES THIS MEASURE HAS NO OPPOSITION. I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE I HAVE WITNESSES ON THE PHONE- IN SUPPORT CHASIN ROSENBERG WITH- EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT AND HILARY STEPHENSON WITH MID PENINSULA REGIONAL OPEN SPACE DISTRICT. IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS AND I ASKED FOR THE I FELT THANK YOU WILL HAVE A- IN SUPPORT CAN WE PLEASE GET JEEZ- ROSENBERG PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY THE PRIMARY WITNESS MY NAME IS JASON ROSENBERG AND I SERVED AS ASSISTANT DISTRICT COUNCIL FOR THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT. THESE BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT OF THE MULTI COUNTY REGIONAL PARK AND OPEN SPACE DISTRICT CREATED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. A CORE FUNCTION OF THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT LIKE ANY PARK DISTRICT IF THE STEWARDSHIP OF ITS NATURAL RESOURCES. THIS RESPONSIBILITY HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CRITICAL GIVEN THE PRESSING NEED TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING CLIMATE. PART DISTRICTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLANNING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE WITH OF THIS SYSTEM OF PARK LANDS HOWEVER BECAUSE PART DISTRICTS DO NOT HAVE LAND USE POWER IT LIKE CITIES AND COUNTIES THE LEGAL TOOLS. THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED USES OF PARK LANDS ARE STRICTLY LIMITED TO THOSE GRANTED TO US BY STATUTE. IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE PARK DISTRICT STATUTORY GRABBED ALREADY OF LIMITED COMPARED TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IS IN FACT NUISANCE ABATEMENT. IT IS FOR THIS REASON I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN BILL AB NINE FIVE NINE. IF THIS BLL BECOMES LAW IT WOULD PROVIDE THE PARK DISTRICT WITH A VALUABLE TOOL TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGES PARKLANDS. HAVING THE ABILITY TO ADMINISTRATIVELY OBEY ILLEGAL ENCROACHMENTS THAT EXIST ON PARK DISTRICT PROPERTY WOULD IN COMPARISON BE COST EFFECTIVE AND HELP THE PARK DISTRICT EFFICIENTLY CARRY OUT A PLAN STORAGE OF MISSION. THE GOAL WITH THE BEATEN POWER WOULD BE USED TO USE IT AS A LAST RESORT WITH THE INTENT TO HAVE IT FUNCTION AS A DETERRENT INDIVIDUALS ARE CONDUCTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ON THE PARK DISTRICT PROPERTY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ROSENBERG WE ARE LOOKING FOR MISS STEVENSON. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS HILLARY STEPHENSON.

OUR DISTRICTS CANCEL PORTIONS OF THREE COUNTIES AND SEVENTEEN THIRTY. AND ALTHOUGH WE PROACTIVELY COORDINATE AND COMMUNICATE WITH OUR NEIGHBORS PROBLEMS OCCASIONALLY ARISE SOME REAL LIFE EXAMPLES OF ISSUES THAT WE COULD ADDRESS VIA A NEWSGROUP ABATEMENT PROCESS RANGE FROM ILLEGAL TRAIL AND ROAD CONSTRUCTION ON THE HANLAN'S AND DISPOSAL OF CUT VEGETATION WHICH CREATES A FIRE RISK. TO SOME MORE UNUSUAL SITUATION. SUCH AS AN OPERATOR FOR A LLAMA ENCLOSURE AND A BOCCE BALL COURT ENCROACHING ON Q. BELLA KITCHEN MADE PENALTIES OR SLAM. WITHOUT YOU CAN THE BASEMENT ALSO. MIDTOWN ADDRESS INCREASE. THROUGH THE CRIMINAL PROCESS OUR RANGERS ISSUE CITATIONS OR REFER MORE SERIOUS MATTERS TO CRIMINAL COURT AND IN RECENT YEARS AND HOW PREFERRED TO CRIMINAL CASES SHE'S THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR PROSECUTION BOTH OF THOSE CASES HAVE POPPED ME FIRST ILLEGALLY DIVERTED WATER OTHER PROTECTED CREEK ON THE PAR LANDS FOR UNAUTHORIZED. USE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. PROSECUTION THE CASE CLOSE MORE THAN A YEAR FROM TIME THAT WE FIRST DETECTED A VIOLATION AND UNFORTUNATELY EVEN AFTER RECEIVING RESTITUTION THE CRIMINAL PROCESS DOES NOT MAKE MID PENN HOLE FOR THE COSTS AND THE RANGER AND STAFF TIED NECESSARY TO COMMAND. A CRIMINAL ACTION AND STEVE THAT PROCEEDING THROUGH TO CONCLUSION SO SIMPLY PUT WE'RE LYING ON THE CRIMINAL PROCESS CONFUSED. LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES THE COURT RESOURCES AND UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T HAUNT ME ADDRESS THE CONDITION. SO THE HOPE IS THAT EIGHTY NINE FIVE NINE WHAT IF ARE YOU SEE MY OF HOW. IN OUR FORCES.

THIS IS THAT HAVE BEEN- DONE AND DEMONSTRATED BY LOCAL AGENCIES- IN REGARDS TO FUTURE STATES OF EMERGENCY. AND SO WHAT THIS LEGISLATION IN PARTICULAR LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODIES. WILL NOT HAVE TO RELY ON AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO SAFELY CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS- TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS- AMID THESE TIMES OF EMERGENCIES LIKE A DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE OR A- WILDFIRE. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY MAKE IN PERSON MEETINGS DANGEROUS OR SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE. I AM SO INSTEAD THEY WILL HAVE AN OPTION THEY'LL HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO MEET REMOTELY WHILE ENSURING. ACCESS ENGAGEMENT- FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND SO AB THREE SIXTY ONE I WILSHIRE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT. WHEN WE NEED IT MOST- IN FUTURE TIMES OF SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION. I LIKE WE'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THIS PAST. FOURTEEN MONTHS AND SO FOR THESE REASONS MADAM CHAIR RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS MARCUS. DETWILER A LEGISLATIVE ANALYST FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. THURMOND THANK YOU VERY MUCH HARPER AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN SUPPORT IS MARCUS DEPLOYMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF. MY NAME IS A MARKET THAT WHILE THEY'RE ON THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION- AB THREE SIXTY ONE IMPLEMENT THE REASONABLE. COMMONSENSE TIMELY NARROWLY CRAFTED PROVISIONS THAT BOTH ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES TO BE PUBLICLY DURING DECLARED LOCAL EMERGENCIES WHILE ALSO ENSURING TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND PUBLIC ACCESS IS PRESERVED. THE GOVERNOR OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY EXECUTIVE ORDER THIRD OF THE RECOGNITION THAT THE CURRENT PROVISIONS OF THE BROWN ACT DO NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WHERE IT WOULD BE UNSAFE TO CONGREGATE IN ONE LOCATION. TODAY THE MERGING STATE WAS THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC. BUT FUTURE DISASTERS REMAIN TO BE SEEN WE CAN HOWEVER BE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT DISASTER WE THINK NOW OF THE CITY OF PARADISE AN EXAMPLE THAT IT THAT. IN THE CITY OF PARADISE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC INCLUDING LOCAL AGENCY BOARD MEMBERS WERE FORCED TO EVACUATE THE ENTIRE CITY. MEETING REMOTELY PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF AB THREE SIXTY ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP IN SITUATIONS LIKE THE BILL THREE ONE WOULD ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES TO CONTINUE TO MEET PUBLICLY AND PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES WHILE REMAINING SAFE DURING LIFE THREATENING EMERGENCIES. WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AB THREE SIXTY ONE INCLUDE SAFEGUARDS THAT WERE DEVELOPED TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC ACCESS TO THESE MEETINGS IS PRESERVED. OVERALL IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE PUT TO USE ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR IF I EVER. OVERALL AND IMPORTANTLY THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO WEAKEN THE SPIRIT OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRYING TO WITHIN THE BROWN ACT. I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR TIME AND THEIR CONSIDERATION WITH THE REGARD TO AB THREE SIXTY ONE I WILL REMAIN LISTENING IN ON THE LINE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR WILL MOVE INTO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE TO- MRS DEAN AND MISS FINEMAN. OF JUSTIN ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YEAH THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRY MEMBERS CAME WHEN DEAN WHAT LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR STAFF AND SPONSORS OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE BILL LAST MONTH WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S ARCHIVE IN CONSIDERATION OF A PROPOSED REVISION. REGRETTABLY WE MUST OPPOSE. EIGHTY THREE SIX ONE AND MARKET DEMAND AND- THE GOAL OF ENSURE THAT POP AGENCIES CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES DURING TIMES OF CRISIS OR EMERGENCY IF MARKLE. ACCOMMODATIONS MAY TEMPORARILY BE NEEDED TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COMBAT NECESSARY BUSINESS. EVERYONE LAUGHS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST CONNECT THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS IS OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER LEADING FUNDAMENTAL AND LONGSTANDING PUBLIC PROTECTION SHOULD BE EXTREMELY RARE AND HIGHLY CIRCUMSCRIBED. EIGHTY TREE SIX ONE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF A LOCAL AGENCY CAN MEET USING TELECONFERENCE TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BROWN ACT. UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTY THREE SIX ONE GOES TOO FAR BY EXEMPTING ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM THE OBLIGATION TO IDENTIFY THEIR TELECONFERENCE LOCATION. EXCEPT IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES THE REQUIREMENT FOR TELECONFERENCE LOCATION SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE PUBLIC SHOULD REMAIN IN PLACE. ALTHOUGH A QUORUM OF MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY SHOULD PARTICIPATE WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHICAL BACKED BY GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF THE BODY'S JURISDICTION. UNDER EIGHTY THREE SIX ONE THE PREDICATE FOR EXEMPTIONS TO THIS REQUIREMENT IS TOO LAX. IN ADDITION THE BILL SHOULD BE AMENDED TO REQUIRE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY TO APPEAR ON VIDEO DURING PUBLIC MEETINGS WHENEVER TELECONFERENCING FROM THE PRIVATE LOCATION. IT CONCERNS THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHO MIGHT BE IN THE ROOM THE LEGISLATORS INCLUDING LOBBYIST OTHER REPRESENTATIVE OTHER PRIVATE INSURANCE. CONSTITUENTS HAVE A RIGHT TO VIEW THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS ACTING MAKE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEM. FURTHERMORE DIRECT ACCESS TO ELECTED OFFICIALS IS THE CORNERSTONE OF A HEALTHY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. REQUIRING AN INTERNET BASED SERVICE OR A CALL AN OPTION IT INSUFFICIENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BOTH TO THE PUBLIC. THIS ENSURES THAT PEOPLE WITH AN UNSTABLE INTERNET CONNECTION OR NO ACCESS TO INTERNET ARE STILL ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO ATTRACT THE REPRESENTATIVE ON VIDEO. THE CURRENT IS REMINDED OF HOW FRAGILE A FUNCTIONAL GOVERNMENT IS ALL OF OUR WELL BEING. WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS MADE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO STAY CONNECTED DURING HIGH. THE PUBLIC ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE BROWN ACT ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN ATTEND MEETINGS IN PERSON IN CAN DIRECTLY ADDRESSED MEMBERS OF GOVERNING BODY. BROADLY REMOVING ITS ABILITY IS CONTRARY TO THE BASIC TENANTS THE REPRESENTATIVE ACROSS THE- B. HAPPENED. CALIFORNIA ACTION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB THREE SIX ONE TODAY AND NOT KEEPING MANDATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. YEAH I THINK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS OLIVIA STAGNANT AND I'M THINKING GAUGE WENT COORDINATOR BUT LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES FOR EQUITABLE POLICIES EQUAL ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY ALONGSIDE WORLD COMMUNITIES ACROSS. THE SAN JOAQUIN IN EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR STAFF AND SPONSORS FOR THE AMENDMENTS MADE LAST MONTH. BUT WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH EIGHTY THREE SIX HUNDRED NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES THEY WORK WITH THAT WE MUST REGRETFULLY OPPOSED AB THREE SIX ONE AND LEFT IT AT MY DAD. I THERE ARE SOMETIMES FAITH ACTORS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU CAN EASILY MANIPULATE THE PROVISIONS THAT EIGHTY THREE SIX ONE AND CONFIDENCE A LOT IN ORDER TO LIMIT PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE GOVERNMENTAL DECISION MAKING PROCESS. NOT PARTICULARLY XIN IN THE PAST YEAR WE'VE SEEN HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE YOU SEE AN ABILITY TO MEET IN PERSON TO LIMIT THE PUBLIC AND CUT. SAMPLE ANAHEIM CITY COUNCIL LIMITED PUBLIC COMMENT ON AN UNPOPULAR GOP UNTIL EIGHT AM. SIMILARLY THE FACT THAT- COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MAKE DECISIONS TO ELIMINATE A COLD TESTING SITE IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY OF TOWN TO A CREEK. WITHOUT INPUT FROM RESIDENTS. WELL THE REASON AMENDMENT IN PERFECT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE STILL REMAIN CONCERNED WITH EIGHTY THREE SIX ONE FAILURE TO BE DEFINED TELECONFERENCE TO ENSURE THAT LEGISLATIVE BODIES MUST MEET ON CAMERA AND TO PROVIDE. INTERNET SERVICE IN CALLING OPTIONS TO THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE WHEN HE DID NOT THINK TO MEET IN PERSON. ADDITIONALLY THE DEFINITION OF EMERGENCY IS WAY TOO BROAD AND COULD EASILY BE ABUSED BY ELECTED OFFICIALS. ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RATIFY AMERICANS SITUATION EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND APPLYING THE SAME PROVISION ALL TYPES OF EMERGENCIES. IF INDIVIDUAL A LECTIN OFFICIALS TOO MUCH POWER OVER PUBLIC ACCESS AND LACK NUANCE. IN A WILDFIRE EVACUATION FOR EXAMPLE IT IS STILL POSSIBLE TO REQUIRE ELECTED OFFICIALS TO BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. PROTECTING THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT. AB THREE SIX ONE SHOULD BE TAILORED TO PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND SHOULD ONLY ALLOW AUTHORIZED PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO DECLARE EMERGENCY. SITUATIONS THAT LIMIT PUBLIC ACCESS. AB THREE ONE DEFICIENT VEGAN THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM THESE MODIFICATIONS OF THE BROWN ACT UNDER TEN U. S. SECOND GET THAT. OF COURSE IN MANY INSTANCES ANY TENUOUSLY DECLARED EMERGENCY COULD LIKELY BE REGARD FOR THE LAW. BUT NOT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE THE RESOURCES TO LITIGATE. FRANKLY THE IDEA THAT THE OWNERS SHOULD BE ON PRIVATE SECTOR ACTORS TO HOLD GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE RATHER THAN CREATING PUBLIC SAFEGUARDS AGAINST CORRUPTION IN THE FIRST PLACE. FUNDAMENTALLY MISUNDERSTANDS. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN OUR SOCIETY. BECAUSE AB THREE ONE DOES NOT DO ENOUGH TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM ABUSE WE MUST OPPOSE IT AND LEFT MANAGED TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS THEY'RE MADE. AS IT IS WRITTEN OUT AB THREE SIX ONE PROVISIONS COULD EASILY EVEN IF EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO LIMIT PUBLIC ACCESS. FURTHERING THE MARGINALIZATION OF COMMUNITIES WHO ALREADY FACE MANY BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY NO I SEE NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ON THE PHONE VIBRATOR. FOR IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. THREE SIXTY ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO.

I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION BY THE PUBLIC IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.
