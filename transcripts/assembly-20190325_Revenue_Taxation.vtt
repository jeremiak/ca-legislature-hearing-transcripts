00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:24.775
QUICK MEN IN THIS WAY THE SALES

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:25.876
AND USE TAX EXEMPTION --

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:27.011
CERTAINLY WE WOULD PREFER A

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:28.579
GENERAL UND ALLOCATION WE DO

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.147
CONSIDER THIS. TO BE A LOT OF

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:31.582
ALL PUBLIC POLICY GOAL WE'RE

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:32.516
JUST CONCERNED AGAIN ABOUT THE

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:33.884
PRESIDENT THAT IT SETS AT THIS

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:36.120
TIME WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:36.954
THE BILL THANK YOU.

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:38.122
THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:40.057
IN OPPOSITION XENON COMMENTS OR

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.792
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:44.662
DOCTOR PARK.

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.263
SO YEAH THAT'S THE THE ISSUE

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.999
HERE IS YOU NEED THE MONEY.

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:51.201
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:52.937
THE PROBLEM IS WHAT IS THE BEST

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:56.073
WAY TO DO IT -- I DON'T KNOW

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.474
MUCH ABOUT.

00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:59.777
THESE -- DISTRICTS ACROSS THE

00:42:59.843 --> 00:43:01.946
STATE AND WHOSE WELL FUNDED AND

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:03.580
WHO ISN'T.

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.082
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT.

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:06.583
YOU COULD END UP WITH A

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.087
RELATIVELY WELL OFF -- DISTRICT

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:11.722
GETTING A BIG BREAK AND THE

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:13.157
SMALL DISTRICT THE CAN CAN'T

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:15.059
REALLY EVEN PURCHASE EQUIPMENT

00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:16.560
GETTING NO BREAK AT ALL.

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:18.162
AND THAT WOULD BE MY CONCERN

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:18.696
WITH THAT.

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:21.532
APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO A GRANT

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:25.402
REAP GRANT APPROACH -- SO THAT'S

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:27.538
THE OTHER WELL THERE'S ONE OTHER

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:30.107
ISSUE WHICH IS PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.643
DEPENDS UPON A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.078
MONEY THAT COMES INTO THE STATE.

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:36.113
AND ONCE YOU DECREASE THE TAXES

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.649
COLLECT COLLECTED THOUGH YOU

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:40.384
DON'T MEAN TO CUT THE MONEY.

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:41.785
GOING TO THE SCHOOLS IN AFFECTED

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:43.220
CUTS THE MONEY GOING TO THE

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.288
SCHOOLS.

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:45.990
IF YOU HAVE A GRANT PROGRAM THAT

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:48.025
MONEY COMES OUT OF THE OTHER

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:49.860
SIDE OF THE GENERAL FUND.

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.895
SO THERE COUPLE OF REASONS THAT

00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:54.298
A GRANT PROGRAM MIGHT BE A

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:55.933
BETTER PROGRAM THAN.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.301
A SALES TAX.

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:59.269
REMITTANCE PROGRAM BOTH FOR

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:01.672
EDUCATION AND FOR MAKING SURE

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:03.474
THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE GOING

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.842
TO SPEND A COUPLE MILLION

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:08.078
DOLLARS A YEAR -- WHERE DO YOU

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.014
SPEND IT WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.782
AND WHAT IT SIMPLY -- TAX

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:13.684
MEASURE YOU MAY NOT BE SENDING

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:19.423
IT TO THE MOST NEEDY DISTRICT.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.625
YES IF I MAY I'M NOT QUITE SURE

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:23.227
IF I HEARD A QUESTION IN THAT.

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:25.095
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND OKAY --

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:26.764
IF I MADE MADAM CHAIR AND THE

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.732
FIRST THING -- ON THE SUGGESTION

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.401
OF A GRAND I RESPECTFULLY --

00:44:30.467 --> 00:44:32.202
RECEIVE THE COMMENTS BY MY

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:34.538
COLLEAGUE -- MISSED WORK BUT ON

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:36.974
THE GRANT -- PROCESS A GREAT

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.375
SUGGESTION HOWEVER.

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.611
IN A GRANT PROCESS NORMALLY IT

00:44:40.677 --> 00:44:43.981
COSTS AN ENTITY TO APPLY FOR A

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:46.250
GRANT -- NORMALLY THEY WOULD

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:48.752
HAVE TO HIRE ON A POSITION OR

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:51.321
REACH OUT TO SOMEONE THAT IS --

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:52.890
THAT DOES THAT IN A PROFESSIONAL

00:44:52.956 --> 00:44:54.725
WAY TO EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.460
QUALIFY FOR A GRANT.

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.562
THEREFORE RISKING -- THE FACT

00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:00.197
THAT THEY ARE PAYING OUT MONEY

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:02.166
TO BE A PART OF THIS GRANT

00:45:02.232 --> 00:45:02.599
PROCESS.

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:05.102
AND MOST LIKELY WALKING AWAY

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:08.372
WITHOUT THE GRANT SO -- I DO

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.340
UNDERSTAND THAT AND RESPECT THAT --

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:14.144
HOWEVER IN A SALES TAX EXEMPTION

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:16.013
FOR VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.715
IT IT IS -- DESIGNED TO REACH

00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:21.819
THE RULE -- AREAS MAINLY THAT

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:23.921
ARE UNDER SERVED I'M NOT SURE IF

00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:25.289
WE WOULD FIND VERY MANY FIRE

00:45:25.355 --> 00:45:26.523
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE VOLUNTEER

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.960
AND SAN FRANCISCO OR LA FRESNO

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:32.796
OR SACRAMENTO -- IT'S MOSTLY IN

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:36.233
RURAL AREAS WHERE WILDFIRES ARE

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.234
HAPPENING.

00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:38.202
SO -- THE TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:39.269
BE LOST FROM THOSE WILD FIRES

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:40.471
ARE FAR GREATER THAN THE TWO

00:45:40.537 --> 00:45:41.839
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:43.340
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT -- THAT

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:44.741
WOULD BENEFIT VOLUNTEER FIRE

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:47.211
DEPARTMENTS.

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:49.513
PLACE YOUR BRO.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.348
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- CHIEF

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:53.784
REAL QUICK IS HAVE YOU EXPLORED

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:56.353
THE OPPORTUNITIES OF MILITARY

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.655
SURPLUS EQUIPMENT MAY BE USED

00:45:58.722 --> 00:45:59.189
EQUIPMENT FROM SOME OF THE

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:00.891
BIGGER.

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:03.260
ENTITIES IN THE STATE.

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:06.296
YES THE PROBLEM WE'RE FACING IS

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:07.464
THE FOLLOWING A LOT OF TIME A

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:09.466
LOT OF DEPARTMENTS.

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:11.168
PAID AND VOLUNTEER ARE

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:12.603
STRUGGLING SO MUCH THAT BY THE

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:14.204
TIME A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IS PUT

00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.473
UP FOR SURPLUS.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.242
IT IS BEYOND IT'S TIME.

00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:20.377
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE TRUCK THAT

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:21.979
WE'RE GOING TO PURCHASE.

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.480
BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRAINTS OF

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:24.848
THE SIZE OF THE COMMUNITY THE

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:27.251
SIZE OF OUR FIRE STATIONS SUCH

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:28.919
WE ARE REQUIRED TO GO OUT AND

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.787
GET SOMETHING THAT CAN FIT.

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:34.491
THAT IS NOT AVAILABLEON THE

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:37.461
OPEN USED MARKET -- SO THAT'S

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:40.731
WHY NOW WE ARE.

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.466
GOING TO BEYOND.

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:44.034
OUR OWN FUNDING.

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.469
WE'RE LOOKING OUT TO LOCAL

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:48.438
INDUSTRY WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR A

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:50.641
BEER QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT

00:46:50.707 --> 00:46:52.276
AND REPLACEMENT FUNDS WE'RE

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:54.945
REACHING OUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:56.914
TO GET THE MONEY TO REPLACE

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.749
THESE EQUIPMENT AND IT'S JUST

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:00.250
NOT MOBILE EQUIPMENT.

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:01.985
I DID I TALKED ABOUT AIR PACKS

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:04.288
WERE TALKING ABOUT -- DEFEAT BE

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:07.224
LAY ALL THE THINGS THAT -- WE

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:09.259
ARE REQUIRED [inaudible] TO

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:10.527
REPLACE [inaudible]

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.563
UPDATE.

00:47:12.629 --> 00:47:15.799
BASED ON STATUTE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:18.735
LAW AND JUST OF STANDARD SUCH AS

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:19.836
NFPA.

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:22.072
SOUL THE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

APPRECIATE THE THE IDEA GRANTS

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.683
THE PROBLEM IS.

FEMA.

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:39.990
BUT THE PROBLEMS ARE THAT SO

00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:43.360
MANY GRANTS ARE SO LIMITED --

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:45.262
NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT WE HAVE TO

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:46.930
BUY THESE THINGS.

00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:48.332

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.451
FIFTY ONE IT NEEDED TO BE.

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:37.620
FIXED UP -- I DIDN'T AB ONE

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.322

THAT MONEY BACK SO OUR PROPERTY

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:27.170

THE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:42.565

THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS TAKE THE

WORDS IT IS ON THE HOOD TIGHT.

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.992
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:11.560
CUSTOMERS TO PAY LESS EVERY

FOUR THOUSAND MILES ON IT.

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:09.952
THAT IS THE TYPE OF CAR WERE

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:12.054
SOMEBODY COULD TRADE IN THEIR

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.756
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD VEHICLE AND GET

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:15.658
SOMETHING CLEANER.

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:18.494
IT IS IMPROVING THE FLEET IT IS

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:21.630
AN IMPORTANT ASPECT IN THESE ARE.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:23.332
HONEST TO GOODNESS REAL

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.134

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:27.436
LOT OF TIME ON GREENHOUSE GAS

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:30.105
BUT I CAN TELL YOU IT IS

01:08:30.172 --> 01:08:32.074
SOMETHING MY FOLKS ARE FOCUSED

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:34.844
ON WE WANT TO HELP SELL MORE

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.545
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THE WAY

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.180
TO DO THAT IS TO INCREASE

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.448
CONSUMER DEMAND.

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:41.450
THIS BILL WILL HELP CREATE

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:42.852
INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND. ONE

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:45.788
FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY BEFORE --

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.523
I ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT WHEN IT

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.657
DOES COME UP.

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:52.194
IF IT DOES COME UP -- IS

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:53.596
RECENTLY A STUDY WAS.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.598
PRODUCED AND THERE ARE TWO AREAS

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:56.832
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.901
ARE KNOWN FOR HAVING THE OLDEST

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.770
VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:03.172
THOSE TWO PLACES ARE THE SAN

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:06.375

IN SAN DIEGO.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.380
SO OF THE TOP TEN PLACES IN THE

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.415
COUNTRY PEOPLE ARE KEEPING THEIR

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:15.184

MANUFACTURER THANKS -- WITNESSES

01:09:58.193 --> 01:10:00.596
IN OPPOSITION.

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:01.630
WE ACTUALLY HAVE LIKE A COUPLE

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:02.565
OTHER BILLS BEFORE THIS

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:03.933
COMMITTEE TODAY DO NOT OF A

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.401
POSITION YEAH IT'S MADE THE

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:06.735
CORPSMAN AT COMPANY TAX REFORM

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:08.103
ASSOCIATION THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.238
OF TWO BILLS UP BEFORE THIS

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:10.472
COMMITTEE RELATED TO ZERO

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:12.308
EMISSION VEHICLES -- TODAY WOULD

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:13.709
NOT HAD A CHANCE TO COMMUNICATE

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:15.511
WITH EITHER AUTHORS OFFICE BUT

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:16.845
AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY CTO

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:19.481
RATE IS NOT OPPOSE INCENTIVIZING --

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:20.849
THE PURCHASE OF WERE YOU SAID

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:22.151
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE CERTAINLY

01:10:22.217 --> 01:10:23.385
WE HAVE A PRETTY AMBITIOUS GOAL

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:25.187
TO MEET AS A STATE BY TWENTY

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:25.921
THIRTY ON WHERE WE DO HAVE

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.756
CONCERNS ON THIS BILL ARE TWO

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:29.725
FOLD -- ONE AND THERE'S A LARGER

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.060
CONVERSATION HAPPENING OR WE

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:32.528
HOPE WILL BE HAPPENING RECORDING

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.063
FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY WHERE THE

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.030
STATE SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:36.498
CONFORM OBVIOUSLY THIS

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:38.100
POTENTIALLY COULD BE SOMETHING

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:39.535
THAT IS OUT OF CONFORMITY -- IN

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:41.070
THE STATE'S TAX CODE AND THE

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:42.471
NUMBER -- TWO AND THIS IS THE

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.373
LARGER ISSUE IS THE USE OF THE

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.342
GENERAL FUND TO SUBSIDIZE --

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:48.210
THIS TYPE OF INCENTIVE RATHER

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.244
THAN FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE'S

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:50.412
TRANSPORTATION FUNDS IN

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:51.714
ALLOCATING DIRECTLY THROUGH

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.948
THERE AS PART OF A LARGER

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.583
TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY SO

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:56.085
BETWEEN NOW AND A POTENTIAL VOTE

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:56.819
ON THIS WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE

01:10:56.885 --> 01:11:01.056
WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON NOT

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:03.325
SPECIFICALLY THANK YOU.

01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:05.294
COMES THE QUESTION FOR THE

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:05.561
COMMITTEE.

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:07.963
DOCTOR QUIRK.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.765
SO MY I HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS.

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:10.432
NOW THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK

01:11:10.499 --> 01:11:12.701
ABOUT THE FIRST ONE IS THIS IS

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.203
REALLY COMPLICATED.

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:16.872
SOMEBODY ISN'T GOING TO KNOW

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.307
WHEN THEY SAY I MEAN.

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:19.808
NOW AFTER BATTLE LEVIN YEARS

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:21.477
THAT'S ABOUT WHEN I TRADE MY CAR

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:23.746
AND I HAVE NO IDEA AT THE TIME

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.481
WHAT THE TRADE IN VALUE WAS

01:11:25.547 --> 01:11:30.185
GONNA -- AND SO I HAVE NO IDEA

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:31.787
WHAT I'M GOING TO GET BACK.

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:34.390
THROUGH THIS TAX BREAK OR EVEN

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:34.990
WHAT I'M GOING TO GET FOR THE

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:35.824
CAR.

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.826
SO I DON'T THINK THIS WILL

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:39.695
ACTUALLY ACT AS AN INCENTIVE I

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:42.264
THINK A BETTER INCENTIVE IS. FOR

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:44.033
EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:44.967
THERE WAS AN INCENTIVE FOR

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:46.168
PEOPLE TO GET RID OF THEIR

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.003
CLUNKERS THERE WAS SO MUCH I

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:49.905
DON'T REMEMBER THE DETAILS.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.141
BUT SO MUCH FOR CLUNKER OR WE

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:55.511
CAN JUST MAKE SURE THAT.

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:56.812
FRANKLY I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.247
TO HAVE INCENTIVES.

01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:00.783
ARE FOR PURCHASE OF SECONDHAND

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:02.551
ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO KEEP THEM

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:03.752
ON THE ROAD.

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.688
OUR BUT AGAIN YOU COULD HAVE A

01:12:05.754 --> 01:12:07.756
PROGRAM ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:09.558
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:10.759
OR ANOTHER FIND.

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:12.761
THAT SIMPLY MORE TRANSPARENT

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:15.030
THAN THIS MY DIFFICULTY IS THAT

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:17.399
THIS JUST ISN'T VERY TRANSPARENT.

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:18.867
THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NO IDEA

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:20.202
WHAT IT'S WORTH UNTIL

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:22.438
PRACTICALLY THEY BOUGHT THE CAR.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.806
BECAUSE USUALLY DON'T EVEN FIND

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.207
OUT ABOUT WHAT YOUR TRADING IS

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:26.408
RIGHT AWAY YOU CAN LOOK AT THE

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.243
BLUE BOOK BUT WHO KNOWS WHICH

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.278
GAP.

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:31.013
SO IT'S THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.815
AND I JUST THINK OTHER TYPES OF

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.650
MORE DIRECT INCENTIVES MIGHT

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:35.951
WORK BETTER AND PERHAPS YOU

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:38.053
COULD PICK ABOUT THAT.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.255
IT WAS A GREAT COMMENTS.

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:41.323
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:46.161
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:47.396
SO I'M ACTUALLY ALSO PRESENTING

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.131
THE OTHER BELL ON ZERO EMISSION

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.699
VEHICLES TODAY I'M JUST A

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.167
QUESTION IN YOUR PRESENTATION

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:54.570
YOU SAID THAT IT WAS LOW AND

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:55.904
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO WHAT

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:57.940
ACTUALLY IS WHAT IS A LOW

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:59.942
EMISSION VEHICLE.

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:02.444
SO I'LL DEFER TO QUIT.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:03.178
YEAH THESE ARE BOTH VEHICLES

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:05.080
THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO GET THE H.

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.648
APPEALING STICKER SO WELL LOW

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:09.118
EMISSION IS YOUR PLUG IN HYBRID.

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:11.320
THE MOST -- COMMONLY KNOWN AS

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:13.288
THE CHEVY VOLT BUT THE PREVIOUS

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:17.092
PRIME THAT AND OKAY RIGHT I JUST

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:17.292
WANT.

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:19.795
TO MAKE SURE THANKS.

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:20.796
I'M. TO DOCTOR COURTS POINT

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:22.131
THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:23.265
ARE LIKE OUR CLASS CASH FOR

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:24.833
CLUNKERS THAT DO TRIED

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:25.601
INCENTIVIZE FOLKS TO GET INTO

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:26.168
SECOND.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:27.302
HAND THE VEHICLES HOWEVER THE

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:29.037
LINE FOR THEM IS THE WAITING

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:31.340
LIST FOR THEM IS SO LONG.

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:34.977
THAT -- WE WE DO HAVE A BACKLOG

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:36.145
AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET.

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:38.781
PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND TWO

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:39.581
ZERO MISSION AND LOW AND LOW

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:40.783
EMISSION VEHICLES AND SPECIALLY

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:42.184
THEY WILL ONLY AFFORD SECONDHAND

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.353
VEHICLES -- SO I CONTINUE TO BE

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:46.088
A SUPPORTER OF THAT CONCEPT I

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.322
BELIEVE THAT WE WILL NOT SEE POR

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:48.657
EL THE INTO ALL COMMUNITIES CAN

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:50.626
PARTICIPATE AND WE HAVE NOT

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:51.693
REACHED THAT POINT YET.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.995
OUT WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO

CALLING FOR FIVE MILLION ZERO

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:27.222
LONG WAY TO GO.

FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES LIKE

HYDROGEN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:36.765
THE LARGEST HYDROGEN PRODUCING

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:38.767

CONSUMER ADOPTION AS WE'VE HEARD

01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:49.478
DOES REMAIN A CHALLENGE.

01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:51.213
THIS BILL WILL CREATE PARITY

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.447
BETWEEN THE TWO SEVEN

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:53.615
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IN THE

THE PROPOSED EXEMPTION IS

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:04.192
TEMPORARY AND THIS WILL ENABLE

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:05.928

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:07.696
THIS POLICY CHANGE.

SUGGESTION ON A COUPLE POINTS OF

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:15.804
CLARIFICATION THERE IS A

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:16.571
QUESTION AROUND.

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:18.273
WHERE THIS WOULD APPLY AND IT

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.510
WOULD APPLY TO BOTH THE?

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:24.246
RETAIL SALES HI AND THE THINGS

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:26.081

RETAIL CELLS BUT ARE STILL.

01:16:27.482 --> 01:16:28.650
SOLD ON TO CONSUMERS WILL

CERTAINLY TAKE ON CAR FIND

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:31.753
AMENDMENTS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:32.387
PROCESS.

SHANE STEPHENS FROM FIRST ON

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.731
THAT FUEL AND TO RESET CUT FROM

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:44.366
ENERGY INDEPENDENCE NOW

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:45.934
WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:46.501
GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:47.936
TERESA COOK ON BEHALF OF ENERGY

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.705
INDEPENDENCE NOW I'M VERY

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:53.175
PLEASED TO BE SUPPORTING AB --

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:53.842
SEVEN FORTY FIVE AS THE ASSEMBLY

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:55.544
WOMAN ELOQUENTLY STATED THERE

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:57.112
ARE TWO MAIN PURPOSES OF THIS

01:16:57.179 --> 01:16:59.948
BILL WINE IS THE PARITY AND TAX

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:01.550
TREATMENT BETWEEN BOTH ZERO

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.618
EMISSION VEHICLE FUELS -- AND

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:05.320
THEN THE SECOND IS RECOGNIZING

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:07.089
THAT FOR THE TIME BEING IN ORDER

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.523
TO MEET THE ENVIRONMENT ON%

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:09.758
CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS THAT THIS

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.560
STATE HAS WE NEED TO TRY TO

01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:13.962
REDUCE OR ELIMINATE -- BARRIERS

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:15.831
TO OWNERSHIP -- AND THIS BILL

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:19.468
WILL GO A LONG WAY TO DOING NOT

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.870
SO THANK YOU.

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:23.005
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:24.239
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.108
NAME IS DOCTOR SHANE STEPHENS ON

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:26.742
ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF FIRST ON

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.210
THE FUEL -- WERE COMPANY FOUNDED

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:30.345
AND BASED IN IRVINE CALIFORNIA.

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:31.713
AND WE RETAIL HYDROGEN TO KERR'S

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.182
BOOKS -- THE THE THING WE DO --

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:36.718
SO TODAY WE DO PAY A SALES AND

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:38.687
USE TAX OUR CONSUMERS DO -- AT

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:41.890
THE PUMP -- BECAUSE OF OLD CODE --

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:42.591
YOU KNOW IT'S ODD FOR A

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:43.592
TRANSPORTATION FUEL TO BE

01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:45.260
TREATED THIS WAY BUT THAT'S THE

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:46.695
THE OLD CODE THE WAIT IS.

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.864
A PLUG IN ELECTRIC ZERO EMISSION

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:53.802
VEHICLES DO NOT PAY ANY KIND OF

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:54.436
NOT TAX WHEN THEY CHARGE UP.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.170
BECAUSE OF THAT SB ONE WAS

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:57.839
INTRODUCED AND PASSED LAST YEAR --

01:17:57.906 --> 01:17:59.808
SO THAT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:02.010
WOULD PAY A REGISTRATION FEE --

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:02.644
TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT THEY'RE NOT

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:04.813
PAYING AT THE PUMP -- HOWEVER

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.681
FUEL CELL CARS GOT LUMPED INTO

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:07.382
THAT CATEGORY.

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:08.950
TOO SO NOW WE HAVE THE JOY OF

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.318
PAYING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:13.121
FENCE WE PAY AT THE PUMP.

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:14.289
AND WE PAY THIS REGISTRATION FEE.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.758
SO I THINK THE PARITY ARGUMENT

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.126
IS A IS A VERY STRONG -- ONE AND

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:19.261
WE WOULD LIKE.

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:20.462
TO GET TREATED IN THE SAME

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:21.763
CATEGORY AS THE PLUGIN ZERO

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.632
EMISSION VEHICLES AND NOT HAVE A

01:18:23.698 --> 01:18:26.401
CONSUMERS ALSO BEING.

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:28.136
HIT WITH TAXES AT THE PUMP --

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:28.670
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.639
MENTION ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT --

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:32.207
WE DID VOLUNTARILY INTRODUCE --

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:34.309
SUNSET DATE -- KNOWING THAT

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.811
DAVID RUFFIN MAKE US DO SO

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.646
ANYWAY -- BUT THE THE IDEA

01:18:37.712 --> 01:18:39.548
BEHIND THAT WAS -- YOU KNOW TO

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:40.549
GET.

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.918
LUMPED INTO THIS KIND OF SB ONE

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:44.453
CATEGORIZATION OF JOBS FOR NOW.

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:46.321
BUT WE THINK IN FOUR YEARS ONCE --

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.856
WE'VE GROWN TO A SLIGHTLY LARGER

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:48.957
LEVEL WE HELP.

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:50.192
OUT WE COULD HAVE A MORE

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:51.460
MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:52.727
HOW SHOULD HYDROGEN BE TREATED

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:54.696
RIGHT SHOULD IT BE -- TAX MORE

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:55.831
LIKE GASOLINE SHOULD BE THAT

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:57.299
CONTINUE TO BE A REGISTRATION

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:59.067
FEE OR YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE EVEN

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:01.169
TALKING ABOUT MAYBE A VMT TAX.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:02.437
AND A WHOLE KIND OF OVERALL OF

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:05.173
THE CODE SO -- WE HOPE THAT

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.875
COINCIDES WITH -- ARE SOME SAID

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:08.210
THEY COINCIDES WITH A BIGGER

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:08.977
DISCUSSION WE CAN HAVE ABOUT

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.278
THAT -- AND FINALLY I JUST WANNA

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:12.214
TALK ABOUT THE REALITY OF WHAT'S

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.682
HAPPENING ON THE GROUND -- TODAY

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:16.051
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ABOUT

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:16.718
SEVEN THOUSAND FUEL CELL CARS ON

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.153
THE ROAD -- THAT'S BEEN

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.121
OCCURRING OVER THE PAST THREE

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:21.423
YEARS -- IT'S AN EXCITING START --

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:22.757
BUT THAT'S A VERY SMALL VOLUME

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:24.826
OF CARS -- SOME FUEL IS A

01:19:24.893 --> 01:19:26.461
VOLUMES GAME RIGHT WHEN WE GET

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:27.529
TO MORE SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES THE

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.631
ECONOMICS WORK VERY WELL WE CAN

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:30.799
BE COMPETITIVE.

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:32.267
TODAY IS VERY HARD TO BE

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:33.335
COMPETITIVE.

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:34.936
AND SO OUR PRICES ARE HIGHER AT

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:36.538
THE PUMP THAN WHAT WE WOULD LIKE

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:37.739
AND WHERE THEY NEED TO BE.

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:39.708
BECAUSE OF THAT AUTO MAKERS HAVE

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.643
BEEN PAYING FOR SOME OF THE FUEL --

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:43.145
THIS IS NUMBER ONE DISCOURAGING

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:44.279
TO AUTO MAKERS YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:46.281
NOT A GAME THAT THEY CAN BE IN

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:47.549
LONG TERM TO PAY FOR THE FUEL.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:48.950
NUMBER TWO THE OTHER THING THAT

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:51.052
STARTED HAPPENING IS -- AFTER

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:52.220
THREE YEARS OF SALES A LOT OF

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.221
THESE CARS HAVE BEEN EITHER

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.490
COMING OFF LEASE AND HAVE TO GO

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:56.892
INTO THE SECOND HAND MARKET.

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.727
OR LEAVE FOR THOSE WHO BOUGHT

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:00.195
AND OWNED THE CAR THE THREE

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:02.130
YEARS OF FREE FUEL PAID BY

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:03.632
AUTOMAKERS HAS TIMED UP.

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:04.966
SO NOW CONSUMERS ARE ACTUALLY

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:06.668
GETTING HIT BY THIS DIRECTLY --

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:08.537
AND IT'S GOING TO I THINK

01:20:08.603 --> 01:20:10.572
BECAUSE A GROWING PROBLEM OF

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.474
USED FUEL CELL CARS SITTING ON

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:13.775
THE LOT RATHER THAN BEING PUT

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.010
INTO THEIR THEIR SECOND SECOND

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:17.379
LIFE AND I THINK FOR FOR MANY

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:19.014
COMMUNITIES AS CHAIRWOMAN UPPER

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:19.481
POINTED OUT.

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:20.615
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT --

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.717
THAT USED CAR MARKET SO THAT

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:23.485
CONSUMERS CAN GET INTO THE

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:24.819
SERVICE.

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:26.955
AND DOT RIGHT NOW THE PRICE OF

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:28.156
FUEL AT THE PUMP IS CAUSING A

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.824
PROBLEM SO SO IN ADDITION TO THE

01:20:29.891 --> 01:20:31.593
PERRY ARGUMENT THIS WILL JUST.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.194
HELP US AT THIS POINT WE'RE A

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.695
SMALL YOU KNOW NON PROFITABLE

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:41.002
COMPANY AND INDUSTRY -- GET TO A

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:42.204
FASTER WHERE WE CAN COMPETE WITH

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.804
MORE CONVENTIONAL FUELS THANK

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:45.207
YOU.

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:46.474
ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN SUPPORT.

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:47.842
GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:49.344

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:50.412
SUPPORT THANK YOU.

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:54.516
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:55.083
SOME OF THE CARBON WITH THE

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:55.984
CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:57.052
ASSOCIATION I WON'T BELABOR MY

01:20:57.118 --> 01:20:58.486
EARLIER POINTS BUT LOOK FORWARD

01:20:58.553 --> 01:20:59.354
TO COMMUNICATING WITH THE

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.155
AUTHORS OFFICE AS WELL AS THE

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:01.423
CHAIR IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN A

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:03.291
SORT OF LARGER CONVERSATION ON

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:06.161
THIS BETWEEN NOW AND A POTENTIAL

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:06.361
THOáT.

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:06.628
THANK YOU.

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.531
THANK YOU.

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:12.300
DARKER OF COURSE -- SO I DON'T

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:14.603
HIDE WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION.

01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:14.970
I CAN IMAGINE.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.071
WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:18.440
THE THE DIFFICULTY IS THE VAST

01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:21.309
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OWNING

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:22.410
HYGIENE VEHICLE.

01:21:22.477 --> 01:21:24.646
OUR WELL THE BASICALLY GETTING

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.481
THEM FOR FREE.

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:29.551
AND AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY FOR

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:32.220
BOTH THE HONDA AND TOYOTA YOU

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:34.256
GET THIS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:36.057
BACK AT THE VERY BEGINNING.

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:37.792
AND THEN THEY PAY FOR YOUR FUEL

01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:39.027
FURTHER I'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.729
HONDA PEOPLE THAT WHEN THE THREE

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:42.664
YEARS IS UP THEY WANT THE CAR

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.231
BACK.

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:44.899
THEY DON'T WANT IT ON A USED CAR

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:46.301
LOT BECAUSE THEY SAY THE

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:48.803
TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE CHANGED.

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.805
SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS ARE

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:52.741
THERE ANY PEOPLE OUT THERE OF

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:53.942
THE SEVEN THOUSAND VEHICLES

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:56.578
WOULD ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS.

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.346
THE REASON THAT.

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:00.048
THE AUTOMAKERS ARE DOING THIS

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:03.485
SUBSIDIZING THE FUEL IS NOT ONLY

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:06.154
BECAUSE THE FUEL COST BUT THESE

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.622
ARE WERE BETA TESTERS.

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:10.358
I HAD TO HAVE THE WHOLE FUEL.

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:12.927
TANK REPLACED A FEW MONTHS INTO

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:16.364
MY OWNERSHIP BECAUSE IT STOPPED

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:17.232
WORKING.

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.868
AND RIGHT NOW IT'S GONE FROM

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:21.736
GETTING.

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.104
THREE HUNDRED MILES ON A FAILED

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:24.739
TO GETTING TO FIFTY SO I'M GOING

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:26.474
TO TAKE IT IN AGAIN TO FIND OUT

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.676
WHAT HAPPENED THE WERE BETA

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:28.576
TESTERS.

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:31.680
AND MY UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:32.714
FROM HONDA IS THEY DON'T EVEN

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.416
WANT THEM ON THE ROAD ONCE THE

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:35.383
LEASE IS UP.

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:37.752
SO THIS THEN BECOMES MORE OF A

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:39.487
REWARD THAN INCENTIVE NOW IF YOU

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:41.122
CAN SHOW ME THERE'S GONNA BE

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:42.824
LOTS OF PEOPLE ON THE ROAD.

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.626
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.628
NOW WE PAY THE EQUIVALENT OF

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.229
EIGHT DOLLARS A GALLON -- THAT

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:50.899
IF YOU REDUCE THAT.

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:51.466
TO SEVEN TWENTY THAT THAT'LL

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:53.835
MAKE A DIFFERENCE I DON'T THINK

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:56.371
SO BUT MY CONCERN IS THIS REALLY

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:57.272
WILD.

01:22:57.339 --> 01:22:59.407
PROMOTE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:03.078
PROMOTE -- AND ALREADY THE STATE

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:04.412
WITH A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:07.415
REBATE IS AND A STICKER IF YOU

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.184
MAKE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:09.884
THOUSAND A YEAR.

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:11.586
IS ALREADY PROMOTING THIS IN A

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.688
MAJOR WAY AND I'M AGAIN I JUST

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:15.824
THINK THIS WILL BE A BREAK FOR

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.560
HONDA AND TOYOTA -- BUT YOU KNOW

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:19.761
THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:20.895
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY ON IT

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.197
THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:24.165
BELIEVE IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.500
THEY KNOW WERE BETA TESTERS.

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:27.435
AND THEY'RE TREATING THIS VERY

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:29.037
NICELY.

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:30.271
I WOULD I WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:31.973
THAT THESE ARE YOU THESE ARE NAY

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.042
SENT TECHNOLOGIES AND I THINK

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:34.876
THAT.

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.778
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK AS

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.179
POLICY MAKERS.

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.848
YOU I'D LIKE TO SEE AS IT I

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:42.517
THINK WE CAN'T -- IT WE'VE GOT

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:43.351

STRUGGLE TO AFFORD CARE.

SHOWN THAT HOME CARE REDUCES

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:53.615
HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AND

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:55.483
READMISSIONS KEEPING DOWN THE

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:56.751

ARE RECEIVING CARE -- WHEN

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:44.299
PEOPLE DON'T RECEIVE CARE IN THE

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:46.000
HOME THAT THEY NEED -- THEY

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:46.801
DON'T HAVE FAMILY TO SUPPORT

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:49.337
THEM -- INEVITABLY ARE THEY PUT

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:50.572
THEMSELVES IN DANGER SO THERE'S

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:52.273
NEGLECT NEGLECT FOR THEIR OWN

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.043
CARE THE END UP -- THEIR

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:56.511
NUTRITION SUFFERS THEIR SAFETY

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:57.879
SUFFERS THEIR ACTIVITY LEVEL

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.414
STAFFERS WHEN ONE OF THE MOST

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.682
COMMON THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:02.717
THERE ARE THERE ARE AVOIDABLE

01:27:02.784 --> 01:27:04.285
FALLS THAT HE NEVER.

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:09.123
INEVITABLY TURN TO E. R. VISITS

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:10.992
HOSPITAL STAYS.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.527
A NURSING HOME -- THIS IT

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:14.629
SOMETIMES NURSING HOME STAYS SO

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:15.997
THAT'S A ISSUE THE QUESTION IS

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.632
WHY DON'T PEOPLE HAVE MORE CARE

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:18.099
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.133
AFFORDABILITY SO THAT'S WHAT I

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.369
THINK HIS BILL IS ABOUT -- THE

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:22.403
PEOPLE IN THE LOW END OF THE

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.606
SPECTRUM HAVE SOME PUBLIC

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:26.407
SUPPORT THROUGH HSS PROGRAM.

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:27.408
PEOPLE ARE THE HIGH END OF THE

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:29.344
SPECTRUM HAVE DISCRETIONARY

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.478
INCOME.

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:32.447
OR NICE FAT LONG TERM CARE

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:34.015
INSURANCE POLICIES TO PAY FOR IT

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:35.450
BUT PEOPLE ARE IN THE LOWER.

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:38.653
LOWER MIDDLE INCOME RANGE CANNOT

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.455
AFFORD ENOUGH CARE AND IN

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:42.123
CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THIS IS

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:45.093
GETTING MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.094
OVER THE LAST. THREE FOUR YEARS

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.630
WITH THE ADVENT OF PAID SICK

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:51.499
LEAVE OVER TIME.

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:53.768
THEY REDUCTION OF SLEEPOVER --

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:56.604
EXCEPTIONS -- AN EXAMPLE IS IT

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:58.072
WOULD USED TO BE THE LIVING CARE

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.941
WHEN SOMEBODY WAS TAKEN CARE FOR

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:01.175
SOMEBODY TWENTY FOUR HOURS.

01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:06.247
A DAY HAS GONE DOWN BY 90%. 90%

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:07.181
SO IT IS CERTAINLY AN

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:08.916
AFFORDABILITY ISSUE NOW THAT'S

01:28:08.983 --> 01:28:10.718
EXPENSIVE AND IF THEY CARE

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.120
SPECTRUM.

01:28:12.186 --> 01:28:12.920
IN THE LOW AND THE SCARE

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:14.188
SPECTRUM I CAN TELL YOU WITH

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:16.591
MINIMUM WAGE THE CARE GIVERS IN

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:17.925
THIS INDUSTRY MAKE THEIR ABOVE

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:19.160
MINIMUM WAGE AT LEAST TO MY

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:21.362
COMPANY BUT NOT FAR.

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:23.231
SO MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP CARE

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:24.966
GOES UP AND HIS HIS LAST YEAR

01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:27.201
WITH INCREASED TO TWELVE OH CARE

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:28.336
WHEN UP AND THAT'S MORE

01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:30.338
INCREASING IN THE COST OF CARE.

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:31.572
HAS CREATED A SIGNIFICANT

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:33.775
REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:35.209
THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD.

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:37.011
SO IS DEFINITELY THERE'S A ONE

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:38.212
TO ONE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EVEN

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:40.148
SMALL CHANGES IN THE COST OF

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:40.815
CARE.

01:28:40.882 --> 01:28:43.418
HOW MUCH CARE PEOPLE RECEIVE?

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:49.757
SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS -- A TAX

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:50.391
CREDIT CAN BE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:51.292
THAT HELPS AND ACTUALLY THIS

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:52.427
REDUCTION OF OURS IS USUALLY AND

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.795
THE PEOPLE WITH MORE LIMITED

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:54.395
INCOME.

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:55.997
THE ONES ARE GETTING FOR SIX

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:56.631
HOURS OR EIGHT HOURS NOW THEY

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:59.200
DIVIDED DOWN INTO TWO FOUR SO

01:28:59.267 --> 01:28:59.934
FOR HOURS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:00.835
AFFORD IT.

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:03.004
SO I THINK THIS TAX CREDIT COULD

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:04.739
CERTAINLY SWEET IT HIT A SWEET

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:06.074
SPOT IN.

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.742
ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO READ

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:09.777
REMAIN -- PROVIDING CARE FOR THE

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:12.480
LOVE ONCE IN THEIR HOME.

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:14.348
THANK YOU.

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:15.216
GOOD AFTERNOON I'M GOING TO BE

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.453
FIRST TIME I'VE EVER.

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:19.921
TESTIFYING FROM COMMITTEE SO.

01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:21.522
BEAR WITH ME THANK YOU -- MY

HOME CARE ASSISTANCE HERE ANY

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:26.227
SACRAMENTO -- I SPENT THIRTY

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:27.862
YEARS IN IT BEFORE I GOT INTO

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:29.330
THIS BUSINESS AND THE REASON WHY

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:30.765
I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS WAS

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:33.968
BECAUSE I SAW THE NEED. FOR CARE

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:35.903
AND OF THE OF THE RAISING THE

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:38.473
BAR FOR CARE IN IN CALIFORNIA

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:41.709
HERE -- ONE OF THE THINGS I

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:42.677
THINK OF I REALLY WANT TO POINT

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:43.978
OUT TO YOU WITH REGARD TO THIS

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.680
BILL IS.

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:46.948
CURRENTLY THERE ARE SERIOUS

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:48.883
CONSTRAINTS IN JUST PROVIDING

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:50.485
CARE IN GENERAL.

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:52.286
AND WHAT THAT ONE THE REASONS

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:53.488
WHY I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS IS

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:54.489
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:55.790
COMPANIES THAT WERE STARTED BY

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:57.792
INTEL KAREN EVASIONS WAS A COME

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:59.060
AS WORKING FOR IS THERE WERE

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:00.828
STATS THAT SHOW DO WILL NOT BE

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:02.897
ENOUGH BRICKS AND MORTAR PLACES

01:30:02.964 --> 01:30:04.132
FOR PEOPLE TO GO.

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:06.134
WE HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:06.534
DEMAND.

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:09.570
OVER BETWEEN NOW AND TWO

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:10.171
THOUSAND THIRTY WILL APLEY AGE

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:10.638
OUT.

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:11.873
THERE WILL NOT BE PLACES TO GO

01:30:11.939 --> 01:30:14.142
SO WHAT DOES THAT DO IT AND I

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:15.710
ALSO READ AN ARTICLE JUST TODAY

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:17.645
JUST IN PREPARING FOR THIS.

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:20.014
IS THAT OF THE NEAR TIMES POSTED

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:21.516
ON MARCH FOURTH THAT IS STATED

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:22.917
DUE TO CORPORATE BUYOUTS AND

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:24.619
FINANCIAL RUIN MANY SENIOR CARE

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:26.087
FACILITIES HAVE GONE OUT OF

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:27.555
BUSINESS LEAVING SENIORS TO AGE

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:28.923
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:30.725
SO FRANKLY THE OPTION IS THERE

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:31.626
GOING TO HAVE TO STAY IN THEIR

01:30:31.692 --> 01:30:31.826
HOME.

01:30:31.893 --> 01:30:33.494
BECAUSE FIRST FOR THE CAN'T

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:34.295
AFFORD IT SECONDLY THERE'S NOT

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:35.596
GONNA BE ANY OTHER OPTIONS.

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:39.033
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR THESE

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.434
GUYS WELL.

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:41.068
STAYING AT HOME MIGHT BE A GOOD

01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:42.003
OPTION -- AND MOST OF MY CLIENTS

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:43.504
TO WANT TO STAY AT HOME.

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:45.373
UT THE RESOURCES WILL NOT KEEP

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:46.841
PACE WITH THE DEMAND.

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:48.075
THERE'S JUST NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.243
CARE PEOPLE TO GO AROUND

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:51.212
CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW HERE IN EAST

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:52.547
EARING YOU SACRAMENTO.

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:54.248
I'M RUNNING INTO CONSTRAINTS

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:55.750
BECAUSE AMAZON'S HIRING MY

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:56.851
PEOPLE AWAY

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:57.919
STARBUCKS.

01:30:57.985 --> 01:30:59.453
THEY'RE ALL PAYING HIGHER

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.123
MINIMUM WAGE IN THE LABOR FORCE

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:05.493
IS SO STRONG RIGHT NOW THE OTHER

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.861
FOR DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND SO.

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.796
EVER CONSTRAINTS ARE REALLY.

01:31:08.863 --> 01:31:10.031
AUG CONSTRAINED WHAT A SECOND TO

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:11.699
DO THAT'S GOING TO MAKE ME PAY

01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:12.633
THEM MORE.

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.001
WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA HAVE TO

01:31:14.068 --> 01:31:15.503
CHARGE MY CLIENTS MORE.

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.772
OKAY SO TO OUR POINT HERE IS

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:19.407
THAT CARE IS ONLY GOING TO GET

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:20.708
MORE EXPENSIVE.

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:22.910
SO HOW CAN WE CREATE SOME SORT

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:24.278
OF SAFETY NET FOR OUR CLIENTS

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:26.314
AND OUR CONSTITUENTS TO MAKE

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.748
SURE THE CARE IN THE HOME WHICH

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:28.983
FOR HOPE WILL PROBABLY BE THE

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:30.818
ONLY OPTION THEY HAVE.

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:33.087
MORE AFFORDABLE.

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.222
I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.890
HOPEFULLY IT'LL EASE SOME OF THE

01:31:35.957 --> 01:31:37.992
FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT IS GOING

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:40.094
TO HAPPEN TO OUR SENIORS HERE IN

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.596
THE MARKET -- IT JUST IT JUST

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:43.831
MAKES SENSE WE WE ARE RUNNING

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:44.899
INTO.

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:45.867
THE TRAIN'S LEFT THE STATION AND

01:31:45.933 --> 01:31:47.535
WE'RE RUNNING INTO A BRICK WALL

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:49.770
UNLESS WE DO SOME SORT OF THING

01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:51.472
AROUND KEEPING OUR KEY OUR

01:31:51.539 --> 01:31:51.806
SENIORS SAFE.
