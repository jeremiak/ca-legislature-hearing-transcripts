NUMBER FOUR IN YOUR POCKET SENATOR ALLEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU A MEASURE MEMBERS SO I THE INTRODUCTION OF AUTONOMOUS PASSENGER VEHICLES ON TO OUR ROADS AND WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY THAT WE GET AROUND AND HOW WE RESHAPE OUR COMMUNITIES NOW IT'S INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY. I AND THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS READY COULD DRASTICALLY REDUCE COLLISIONS AND ENHANCE TRAFFIC FLOW. THAT'S ALL VERY PROMISING -- BUT OF COURSE IF NOT FIVE FULLY DEPLOYED -- THIS NEW MOBILITY REVOLUTION COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS POTENTIALLY INCLUDING EXACERBATING CLIMATE AIR QUALITY PLANNING CONGESTION CHALLENGES. ARE THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS THERE'S BEEN SOME RECENT STUDIES THAT HAVE FOUND THAT -- BECAUSE A VIS POTENTIALLY MAKE TRAVEL LESS ONEROUS THEIR WIDESPREAD ADOPTION COULD ACTUALLY INCREASE. VEHICLE TRAVEL ARE. BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. I THERE WAS AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED BY PROFESSORS AT UC DAVIS AT BERKELEY GEORGE ATTACK THE MIMIC LIFE WITH ANY V. BASICALLY PROVIDING. YOU KNOW EACH PARTICIPATING HOUSEHOLD WITH A SHOW FOR AND THE EXPERIMENT SAW THAT HOUSEHOLDS TRAVEL EIGHTY THREE M.. PERCENT MORE MILES PER WEEK WITH MORE THAN A FIFTH OF THE VEHICLE TRIPS CARRYING NO PASSENGERS. I WHEN THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THE OPTION OF OF A COMMERCIAL FOR TRAVEL [inaudible] SO. YES THE POINT IS I THERE IS INCREDIBLE PROMISE ASSOCIATE WITH A VIS BUT THE QUESTION IS -- IF IT'S NOT DONE RIGHT IT COULD ACTUALLY MAKE PROBLEMS WORSE. AND SO ARE. YOU KNOW. ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS LOOK AT THIS ISSUE WE'VE LOOKED A LOT OF SAFETY ISSUES. WITH THE REST AB THAT'S BEEN WHERE A LOT OF THE FOCUS IS SPEND BUT THERE'S A WHOLE SLEW OF BROADER SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH THE ROLL OUT OF AB SO. THIS CREATES AN INTERAGENCY GROUP TO TO DELIBERATELY PLAN FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS OUR PLANNING. ARE SENATE BILL THE GOALS WITH THE MIND TOWARD AVOIDING POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ME WORKING STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE BEEN TALKING INDUSTRY GROUPS AND AUTOMAKERS AN ENVIRONMENTALIST TO REFINE THE MEASURE AND INSURE THAT WE DELIVER THE PLAN. WILL NOT SIGNING WHAT COULD BE A A REALLY TRANSFORMATIVE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SO. I'M VERY COMMITTED TO TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS EYES IS BILL PROCEEDS IS REALLY COMING OUT THIS ISSUE AT A THAT. KIND OF A VALUE NEUTRAL PERSPECTIVE. I AND WE'VE GOT A BOOST SO. OKAY IS DONE HERE NO. OKAY SO WELL RYAN I SHOULD CHARGE FROM CAL START IF YOU'RE SPARKS BEGIN -- SUPPORT ABOUT. ORDERS. YEAH GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M RANGE YOU HARD ON BEHALF OF CAL START. WE'RE A CLEAN TECHNOLOGY CONSORTIUM HAS BEEN WORKING FOR THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. TO ADVANCE THE GROWTH AND AND AND DEVELOPMENT OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA. WHETHER THIS STATE IS READY OR NOT AUTOMATED VEHICLES ARE HERE AND THEY'RE POISED TO TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA'S ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. AND HOW CALIFORNIANS USE IT. CAL STARTS ENCOURAGED ADMITTED VEHICLES THE TECHNOLOGY COULD SPEED THE GROWTH OF YOUR MISSION VEHICLES ENCOURAGE CARPOOLING GIVE NEW TOOLS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT AND REDUCE ACCIDENTS WHICH ARE MOSTLY CAUSED BY DRIVER ERROR. BUT SINCE IT IS SUCH A NEW TECHNOLOGY WE ARE JUST GUESSING AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS COMING EXCEPT THAT THE EFFECTS OF A DRIVERLESS FUTURE WILL BE PROFOUND. COMPLEX. ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS. ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP A CLEAR VIEW ABOUT THE FUTURE AUTOMATED VEHICLES THE BENEFITS A CONCERNS MUCH LIKE THAT MUCH LIKE WAS DONE LAST YEAR -- ON ON THE SUBJECT. BUT IN ANY COMMITTEE HEARING ON THE SUBJECT LAST YEAR. BUT THERE ARE STILL MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. HOW WILL AUTOMATED VEHICLES AFFECT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN LAND USE HOW AUTOMATED VEHICLES AFFECT INDIVIDUALS USE OF ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION SUCH AS PUBLIC TRANSIT BICYCLING AND MORE? HOW DO WE PROMOTE SHARED TRANSIT? SHARED PASSENGER ABILITY AND ON BALANCE AUTOMATED VEHICLES HELP OR HINDER CALIFORNIA ACHIEVING ITS CLIMB ECKELS. WE WANT TO GIVE AUTOMATED VEHICLE TAX TECHNOLOGY THE BEST CHANCE TO CREATE THE MOST BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIANS IT SUCCEED IN THE LONG RUN. WHICH WHICH WE CAN SUPPORT TODAY BY ESTABLISHING A CONSENSUS VIEW ACROSS THE AGENCIES IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT WHAT THE KEY ISSUES ARE AND THE GOALS FOR THIS TEST THIS DESTRUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY. FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT I MADE A VEHICLE TASK FORCE IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO CREATE SUCH AN IMPORTANT QUESTION RESPECTFULLY URGE I ABOUT [inaudible] MORE. THE ARE YOU SMARTER. OTHER AYE WITNESSES AND SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. AARON RODRIGUEZ WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS ALSO A CO SPONSOR AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. BROWN AND ASSOCIATES OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. MARK. UP WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE ANY. THE ANY THEN LET'S WRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. YOU HAVE NONE [inaudible] YEAH. TO THE REPORT LET'S SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE A MAN DOWN. BACK TO YOU ARE SENATOR. DO YOU LIKE. TO CLOSE YOUR THIS IS JUST AN ISSUE WE ALL KNOW IT'S COMMON -- AND TWENTY PREPARED SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY BUT WHEN THE QUORUM IS PRESENT. THANK YOU DID YOU HAVE MOTION WE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM SORRY OKAY. I THANK YOU. JOHN I WANTED TO BE THE FIRST ONE GOT A BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR THAT [inaudible] OKAY. NUMBER ONE WHEN WE HAVE YEAH. OKAY SO I SEE SENATE JACKSON IS HERE AND SHE IS AS THIS SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR THIS HAS TO DO WITH. A SINGLE USE MULTI USE COMPONENT TOBACCO PRODUCTS AS ITEM EIGHT IN YOUR AGENDAS MEMBERS. SENATE JACKSON YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. WELL GOOD MORNING LONG TIME NO SEE MR HEY NO. CRAZY WEEK LONG LONG HEARING AS A BUT APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB. FOUR TWENTY FOUR WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE TOBACCO PRODUCT WASTE. PROGRAM TO GREATLY REDUCE EXISTING AND EMERGING WASTE STREAMS ASSOCIATED WITH TOBACCO USAGE. THE TOBACCO PRODUCT WASTE COVERED BY THIS BILL. INCLUDES NACHOS SINGLE USE FILTERS. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CIGARETTE OUR THAT WE SEE UBIQUITOUSLY LITTERING OUR STREETS OR SIDEWALKS ARE GREEN SPACES ARE BEACHES. OUR LAKE FRONTS. BUT ALSO. WOULD ADDRESS PLASTIC TIPS THAT ARE USED AS SINGLE USE PLASTIC TIPS. THAT ARE USED FOR THE MANIPULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS. AND SINGLE USE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES THAT ARE INCREASINGLY PREFERRED BY TOBACCO USERS. AS WELL AS MULTI USE DEVICES OF SEVERAL SORTS INCLUDING VAPORIZERS. TOBACCO PRODUCT WASTE IS AMONG THE MOST VEXING PROBLEMS THAT IS FACED BY MUNICIPAL AGENCIES. IN THEIR EFFORTS TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES CLEAN AND OUR ENVIRONMENT PROTECTED. COSTING MILLIONS TO CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IMPACTS FROM THIS WASTE ON COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE SEVERAL. THE TOBACCO COMPONENT OF THIS WASTE LEECHES TOXIC CHEMICALS INTO OUR WATERWAYS AND OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT. CREATING A SIGNIFICANT HAZARD TO WILDLIFE THE WASTE IS ALSO A HAZARD TO CHILDREN AND PETS WHO MAY UNKNOWINGLY INGESTED IMPROPERLY DISPOSED PRODUCT. WHEN ENCOUNTERING IT OUTDOORS? ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE SEVERAL PLASTIC AN INCREASINGLY ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS TO NEW AND EXISTING TOBACCO PRODUCTS THE CARRY THEIR OWN HARMS. A TO WILDLIFE IN THE ENVIRONMENT. PLASTIC COMPONENTS INCLUDING CELLULOSE FILTERS IN CIGARETTES THANK DECADES TO DEGRADE. BECOME MICRO PLASTICS AND CREATE A DANGEROUS MIX OF TOXIC IN HAT HAZARDOUS TOBACCO AND PLASTIC CHEMICAL POLLUTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE WORLD ARE MAKING EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS TO GET AT THIS PERVASIVE POLLUTION PROBLEM. BUT THOSE EFFORTS HAVE LARGELY FAILED IN NO SMALL PART TO THE PERVASIVE NATURE IN DIFFICULT COLLECTION. OF SINGLE USE COMPONENTS SINGLE USE ENCOURAGES USERS TO DISPOSE OF THEIR CIGARETTE FILTERS BY SMASHING THEM UNDERFOOT. THROWING THEM ON THE SIDE WORK THROWING THEM ON THE SAND BEACH. AND OTHER. OUT WAYS OF JUST SIMPLY LEAVING THEM IN A FORM THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO RECOVER. OR SINGLE USE INVITES USERS TO CASUALLY TOSSED THEIR VAPE CARTRIDGES WHEN NO WROTE RECEPTACLE IS AVAILABLE. ORDER TOSS AN ELECTRONIC VERSION OF A CIGARETTE LIKE THE ONE WOULD. TOSS A TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES. THIS MEASURE SB FOUR TWO FOUR ADDRESSES THIS PERNICIOUS PROBLEM THROUGH A TWO FOLD APPROACH FIRST THIS BILL BANS SALE OF SINGLE USED TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. IN MOST CASES MULTI USE TOBACCO SUBSTITUTE ALREADY EXIST ON THE MARKET AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE. SECOND THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT ALL MULTI USED TOBACCO PRODUCTS BE REGULARLY RECYCLABLE. BY EITHER A LOCAL OR STATE RECYCLING PROGRAM SIMILARTO WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR WHEN WE PASSED A BILL. TO HAVE THE PRODUCERS OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS A DRUGS IN CHARGE CREATE TAKE BACK PROGRAM SO THAT WE COULD REMOVE THEM FROM OUR WASTE STREAM AND FROM. OUR SOCIETY AT LARGE ONCE THEY HAVE EXPIRED OR NO LONGER SERVE ANY USEFUL PURPOSE. SO IF UPON A COMPONENT IS NOT REGULARLY RECYCLABLE. THEN THE MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCT MUST SET UP EITHER A COLLECTION OR MAIL TAKE BACK PROGRAM FOR THAT COMPONENT. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY OR EPR EPR PROGRAMS AS I MENTIONED ALREADY EXISTING CALIFORNIA. FOR SEVERAL DIFFICULT TO HANDLE PRODUCTS USUALLY ADMINISTERED BY CAL RECYCLE. MATTRESSES OF OTHER PRODUCTS OF THAT NATURE TIRES. I AND THEY YUM. THESE PROGRAMS -- ARE AS I MENTIONED ADMINISTERED BY RESELL -- CAL RECYCLING RUN BIKE MANUFACTURER FUNDED STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMS. THIS INCLUDES THE PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG IN SHARP INDUSTRY AS I MENTIONED WHICH STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WILL BE COLLECTED THROUGH A SIMILAR PROGRAM THAT WE ENVISIONED FOR THIS. AND THIS WAS A AS A RESULT OF A MEASURE THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET PASSED LAST YEAR AS BE TO TWELVE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THIS IS A FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- A PROGRAM OF FOLKS OF IF YOU'VE BEEN ON A BEACH CLEAN UP OR ANY KIND OF CLEAN UP DAY YOU'LL NOTE THAT CIGARETTE ****. ARE PERVASIVE. AND IN FACT THERE WAS JUST A CLEAN UP DONE IN THE LAKE TAHOE AREA THAT ACCUMULATED WHAT WAS IT SEVEN IN A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SOUNDS. OF CIGARETTE **** I MEAN THIS THIS PROBLEM REALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT. ONE THERE IS A WAY TO DEAL WITH IT. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DOCTOR TO JOANNE BRASH HO IS THE SPECIAL PRODUCTS MANAGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT. STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF THIS BILL [inaudible] JACKSON -- THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS JOANNE FRESH. IT WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS WHICH ACCOUNTS I ALSO WORK FOR THE NATIONAL STORAGE OF ACTION COUNCIL -- WE'RE NONPROFIT ADVOCATING FOR A CIRCULAR ECONOMY ALSO LECTURE AT UC DAVIS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TEXTILES ON TOPICS OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY. I'M HERE TODAY AS A SPONSOR OF THE BILL TO URGE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR SB. TWO FOUR TWO FOUR TOBACCO PRODUCT REYES HAS CAUSED LONG TERM DAMAGE TO OUR ECOSYSTEM AND OUR COMMUNITIES. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE BEARING THE COST BURDEN TO REMOVE TOBACCO WASTE FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT CANNOT REMOVE ALL THE CHEMICALS AND MICRO PLASTICS. REACHING INTO THE WATER KILLING WILDLIFE AND ENDANGERING PUBLIC HEALTH. REVIEWED RESEARCH INDICATES RISING LONG AND CARCINOMAS. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF ACETATE FILTERS WHICH ALTER TOBACCO COMBUSTION INCREASING SMOKE TOXICANT. AS CITED IN THE JOURNAL OF NATIONAL COUNCIL CANCER INSTITUTE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN JUST RECENTLY. CURRENTLY THERE IS INSUFFICIENT END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT IN PLACE FOR PROPER HANDLING OF TO BACK AWAY. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE SAN FRANCISCO SPENT NEARLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON CIGARETTE BUT CLEAN UP ALONE. IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. THE DOWNTOWN STREETS TEAM ARE AUDITED A TWO MILE STRIP WHICH IS ALREADY CLEANED THREE TIMES A WEEK THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING FOR REGULAR CLEAN UPS AND THEY STILL FOUND OVER ONE THOUSAND CIGARETTE BUT IN JUST THIS SHORT. STRIP OF UNINCORPORATED ALAMEDA COUNTY. I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO LOOK AT THE GROUND TODAY AS YOU LEAVE THE CAPITAL AND NOTICE ALL OF THE CIGARETTE BUT HERE ON OUR OWN LITTLE SLICE OF EARTH HERE IN SACRAMENTO. COSTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PHASE IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF CAPTURE DEVICES. TO MEET THE TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD REQUIREMENTS AS SET BY THE STATE WATER. THIS BILL BANS THE SALE OF SINGLE USE PLASTICS IN TOBACCO PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT MEET STATE AND LOCAL RECYCLING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES BE REUSABLE. AND THE PRODUCERS PROVIDE TAKE BACK PROGRAMS FOR PROPER END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT. WE AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROVIDES INCENTIVE TO ELIMINATE THE WET THE WASTE AFTER SOURCE. WE ASKED PRODUCERS TO TAKE THEIR FAIR SHARE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE HARD TO MANAGE PRODUCTS. AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALONE CANNOT HANDLE THE BY THE COST BURDEN OF TAP TOXIC TOBACCO WASTE. POSING SIGNIFICANT. HEALTH RISKS TO HUMAN AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU YES. BEFORE WE GET TO OUR SECOND WITNESS I NEED TO CORRECT THE RECORD HERE MY NUMBERS WERE OFF AND I DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF HYPERBOLE -- THE IT WAS JUST THIS MORNING ON PUBLIC RADIO BEFORE A CUP OF COFFEE I HEARD THIS SO MY NUMBERS WERE LITTLE OFF. BUT I HEARD A THAT VOLUNTEERS ON EARTH DAY IN AN EARTH THEY CLEAN UP IN SOUTH LAKE TAHOE THAT SO. OTHER THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF THE LEADER THAT THEY COLLECTED CAME FROM THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OF TRASH NOT SEVENTY FIVE WHATEVER I SAID BUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS OF TRASH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF TRASH -- WAS CIGARETTE **** THEY COUNTED OVER SX THOUSAND PIECES SELECTED BY CHEST SIXTY VOLUNTEERS SO. I WANT TO BE ACCURATE ON THAT BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY HORRIFIC SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHENMEMBERS I'M GENEVIEVE AVEDON AND I REPRESENT THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION THAT CONSISTS OF ELEVEN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO PLASTIC POLLUTION SOLUTION. INCLUDING HEAL THE BAY SURFRIDER FOUNDATION AND OTHERS. UP PLASTIC POLLUTION AFFECTS EVERY STREAM RIVER PARK IN STREET IN CALIFORNIA IT STARTS WITH FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION AND CONTINUES THROUGH MANUFACTURING TRANSPORTATION YOU SUCH AND DISPOSAL. PLASTIC THE RECENTLY BEEN FOUND TO EMIT POTENT GREENHOUSE GASES AS THEY BREAK DOWN AND WITH THE PLAN 40% INCREASE IN PLASTIC PRODUCTION OVER THE NEXT DECADE. UNLESS WE MAKE MAJOR POLICY CHANGES TO SIGNIFICANTLY COUNTER THIS PLASTIC PRODUCTION WILL ACCOUNT 420% OF GLOBAL FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION. MOST PEOPLE THINK CIGARETTE **** ARE COTTON AND QUOTE BIODEGRADABLE BUT THEIR PLASTIC FULL OF TOXIC CHEMICALS WHICH HARM WILDLIFE AND IMPACT WATER QUALITY. ADDITIONALLY MICROPROCESSOR BEEN FOUND IN TAP WATER BOTTLED WATER TABLE SALT FISH SHELLFISH AND AGRICULTURAL SOILS ALL OF WHICH POSE A POTENTIAL THREAT TO HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CIGARETTE **** ARE THE NUMBER ONE MOST LETTER THING ON THE THEY'RE FULL OF TOXIC CHEMICALS. AT CLEAN UP DATA INTERNATIONAL OCEAN CLEAN UP DATA SHOWS THAT DURING THE GROUP'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN COASTAL CLEANUP MORE THAN TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CIGARETTE **** WERE PICKED UP WORLDWIDE. TOPPING FOOD WRAPPERS AND PLASTIC BEVERAGE BOTTLES. THE SAME EVENT PICKED UP EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN CIGARETTE **** AND RELATED LETTER FROM COASTLINES IN THE US AND A HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN FROM CALIFORNIA MORE THAN FROM ANY OTHER STATE. IN CONCLUSION CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK TO FINALLY ADDRESS OUR THIRTY YEAR OLD POLLUTION PROBLEM BY ELIMINATING FILTERS ON CIGARETTES. WE THUS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY SO FOLKS WHO WANT TO WIN IN SUPPORT. VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRING GARCIA ON TO HAVE A RETHINK WASTES IN SUPPORT OF A HAVE A HAVE TO RETHINK WASTE OKAY GREAT. AND ALSO SIERRA CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT YOU. GOOD MORNING JUST MULLIN FOR THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS IN STRONG SUPPORT. IT'S LIKE IT DOES ON BEHALF OF STOP WASTE IN SUPPORT. OKAY. THEY WANT TO VOICE OPPOSITION CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. OUR SERVER YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SENATOR WHAT CASKEY. AS CENTER OF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HARMONIZING THIS BILL WITH WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION DID I MEAN THEY THEY PASSED THE PRETTY EXTENSIVE -- A BILL TO OUTLAW CIGARETTE **** BUT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE DATE IS LIKE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FOR IMPLEMENTING EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY THIS IS. THIS IS ALL DUE IN JANUARY. IT SEEMS RATHER ABRUPT. WELL I'M THE REASON THAT WE ARE SENDING AN EARLY DATE IS WE ANT TO GET THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY TO THE TABLE -- IF WE FOLLOW THE PATTERN THAT WE DID GETTING THE PHARMACEUTICALINDUSTRY TO THE TABLE -- WE SAT DOWN AND BASICALLY I THE QUESTION IS SIMPLE THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH HOW DO YOU PROPOSE DOING IT. AND WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WE ESSENTIALLY LEFT IT UP TO THEM TO FIGURE OUT THE METHODOLOGY THEY WERE GOING TO USE WE GAVE THEM CERTAIN METRICS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO OBTAIN. AND THAT BILL BECOMES EFFECTIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO OF AGAIN IT'S A QUESTION OF BRINGING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE HAVING THEM SIT DOWN RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM THE URGENCY OF IT. AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BEST ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND CERTAINLY I SUSPECT THAT IT WILL WE WON'T BE. THERE -- BY JANUARY TWENTY NINETEENTH BUT WE WILL HOPEFULLY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE WITH A REASONABLE START UPDATE. AND HAVE THE INDUSTRY TAKING THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO ADDRESS A MESS THAT WE AS POLICY MAKERS DETERMINE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN OUR STATE I I JUST I JUST KNOW THE EUROPEAN SPENT. ON THEIR PLASTIC RECYCLING SPENT FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING AND JUST ENJOY IN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER THEY GOT A DEAL THAT THEY HAVE AND THAT. PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT OUT OF STATE COMPLIANCE AND IT APPEARS THAT IF THE U. THEY IF. IF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY AND THE PLASTIC FILTER INDUSTRY HAS TO DO THIS IN EUROPE IT SEEM LIKE THIS WOULD BE A WAVE. THE PARALLEL COULD DISCUSSIONS AND YOU HAD SAID THAT WOULD MAKE EMINENTLY GOOD SENSE THE SENATOR AND MY HOPE IS THAT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY WILL. RECOGNIZE THAT IN THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND COME UP WITH THE SPECIFIC SOLUTION RIGHT NOW WE ARE. ABOUT TO HAVE MEETINGS WITH THEM THE BRING THEM TO THE TABLE -- I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THOUGH THAT. SHOULD DO WE AS A LEGISLATURE MAKE CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE GOT. TO HELP. AND IN TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE. THAT THEY WILL COME TO THE TABLE IF THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS THAT WE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY'VE GOT THAT RESPONSIBILITY. AND I AM VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM TO ACHIEVE THE BEST. APPROACH TO RESOLVING THIS PROBLEM AND HAVING THEM. ESSENTIALLY TAKE THE LEAD IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO IT THAT'S WHAT WE DID WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL ISSUE -- AND A BEGIN WITH THE E. F. THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS A SYSTEM THAT WORKS I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HOW WE CAN APPLY THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M NOT. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE LITTLE DETAILS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THIS INDUSTRY BETTER BUT THE RESULTS ARE RESULTS THAT I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS LEGISLATURE WILL MAKE CLEAR. THAT ARE THE POLICY THE STATE AND THAT THEY WILL THEN IMPLEMENT THEM. IN AND IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US. AND THEN MISTER CHAIR THE LAST QUESTION THIS. ART NAY SENT LEGAL MARIJUANA INDUSTRY THAT -- WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THIS IS THIS LEGISLATURE'S NOT SHORT ON NEW REGULATIONS ON HOW WE BELIEVE WE CAN REGULATE POT. YOU KNOW AND AT AND AND DO THAT THIS EXTENDS TO THOSE. A SINGLE USE THIS IS NOT BONGS AND PIPES THIS IS. NO THIS IS SINGLE USE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE PRODUCT IS THAT'S BEING SMOKED WITHIN IT SO IT WOULD HAVE FLOOR IT WOULD APPLY TO SINGLE USE. MARIJUANA CIGARETTES. ARE I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THEY WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT ARE A IT DOES APPLY TO THE RECEPTACLE. REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS BEING SMOKED WITHIN IT. OKAY I'M I'M JUST. HI I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY COME TO THE TABLE. WELL I I THINK. YOU KNOW I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE INVASION SMOKING POT. IS A TOBACCO TYPE PRODUCT OF DIFFERENTLY THAN. THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY ITSELF I MEAN. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BEFORE BUT BETTER TO START THEM RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING I WOULD SUGGEST. THEN HAVE THEM CREATE SOMETHING AND THEN WE SAY NO THAT ISN'T GOING TO WORK TO HAVE THEM IN AT THE GROUND LEVEL I THINK IS. IS HELPFUL TO THEM AS WELL. SO THEY RECOGNIZED THAT SINGLE USE THIS THE DISPOSABLE OF MARIJUANA BOX OR WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO CALL THEM. ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE EITHER. I'M I'M WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A SOMEWHAT OF AN OVERLOAD WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE I'M PASSING VARIETY OF BILLS TO REGULATE THIS COMMUNITY THAT HAS NEVER BEEN REGULATED. AND I'D THE IDEA OF THEM PARTICIPATING IN THE EXTENT OF PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS ON THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL I I GET BUT I JUST JUST SPOTTING THE ISSUES STAFF IS -- BUT IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE. AND AGAIN -- IF THEY COME TO THE IF THEY'LL COME TO THE TABLE AND TELL US. WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE WITH THEIR NEEDS ARE IN A PROPOSAL TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM I'M COMPLETELY OPEN AND AND ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN? IN THEIR THEIR PERSPECTIVE OKAY. GREAT ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS THOUGHTS [inaudible] YEP SUPERVISOR. THE PERSON. WHO POSSESSES THE? CIGARETTE WITH A FILTER ON IT NAY BOUGHT IT IN ANOTHER STATE. YOU KNOW THE BODY YEAR SUPPLY THAT'S POSSIBLE. SO THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THE POSSESSION OF A SINGLE USE FILTER IN THOSE OR CIGARETTES BASICALLY THE FILTER TIP. YES HOW SOME OF THESE BANDS PRODUCT FROM YOU WELL WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MANUFACTURER. THAT'S REALLY THE BEST AND THE MOST BROAD BASED WAY TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM IS THE MANUFACTURER OF THE PRODUCT. SO SOMEONE HAS POSSESSION OF THEM I DON'T THINK WE'VE ADDRESSED THEIR POSSESSION I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WE JUST WANT. TO CLOSE OUT THE USE OF THIS PRODUCT IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING SENATOR JACKSON IS THAT THEY COULD JUST STOP. PRODUCING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN JUST RUN ACROSS THE BORDER TO GET IN THE NEXT GO WHERE. IF IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA COME TO THE TABLE AND HAVE A DISCUSSION. SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THE PAST MIGHT NOT BE THERE AND I AM CERTAIN ISSUE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT. BUT IF YOU'RE A MAJOR CIGARETTE MANUFACTURER AND YOU HAVE TO CHANGE. THE WAY YOU -- MAKE A CIGARETTE WITH THE ATTACHED FILTER ON IT THE HOUSE OF THIS PLASTIC COMPONENTS. NON BY BY AGRADABLE -- THEN YOU'RE. TO CHANGE YOUR ENTIRE WAY YOU MANUFACTURE CIGARETTES TO MY SAY FORGET I'LL JUST SOLOMON MEXICO AND OTHER STATES AND THEN PEOPLE WHO STILL SMOKE I MEAN IT MIGHT BE A DETERRENT -- YOU KNOW IN YOUR HAND DIRECT BENEFIT A DETERRENT TO SMOKING. THEN PEOPLE HAVEN'T BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT POSSESSING. THE EMILY K. IF I BUY THEM -- LET'S SAY I GO OUT OF STATE GET THEM AND I GIVE THEM TO A FRIEND. DOWN THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I KNOW GUILTY OF CONFIDE HAVE. SHARED IT WITH THE PLAN I THINK DOUBTS IN THERE BUT NOT JUST POSSESSING IT MYSELF. AND I I'M I'M ONLY ASKING THE QUESTION I'M ASKING YOU TO FIND AN ANSWER TODAY. THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED WITH THOSE WHO MANUFACTURE CIGARETTES THE MAJOR ON TOBACCO COMPANIES AND HOW. TO GET THEM TO THE TABLE TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS REALLY IMPORTANT ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY I AGREE -- AS FAR AS THE THE USUAL WELL I WON'T SELL IN CALIFORNIA WERE SUCH A LARGE ECONOMY -- THOSE ARGUMENTS WERE USED BACK AT WITH THE AUTOMOBILE STANDARDS THAT WERE CREATED THE CALIFORNIA IS A MAJOR SADLY WHEN IT COMES TO TOBACCO BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S AND HEALTHY. BUT I IN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS THERE ALSO A GETTING IN LINE ON THIS SO -- MANUFACTURERS ARE USUALLY PRETTY SMART THEY SEE THE FUTURE AND CERTAINLY IF IT'S BEEN PRESENTED DIRECTLY TO THEM SO MY HOPE AND EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY WOULD START -- CHANGING THE WAY THEY MANUFACTURE THEIR PRODUCT AND AGAIN. YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY AND OF COURSE THE GOAL HERE WOULD BE A IT CERTAINLY WOULD HELP THE NATION AND THE WORLD IF WE COULD GET RID OF THESE THIS HORRIFIC POLLUTION IT REALLY -- LIKE PLASTICS IS REALLY KINDA TAKING OVER THE PLANET SO -- AGAIN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM WE DID THIS WE WE BASICALLY I WANTED TO BRING THIS BILL. A KIND OF PLAYING OFF THE SUCCESS WE HAD WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY -- WHICH WE WERE TOLD WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AND SO -- BUT IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS ANOTHER VERY SIGNIFICANT A PROBLEM HERE -- IN OUR STATE IN OUR COUNTRY. FOR TE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH AND WHAT HAVE YOU BY. TAKING ON THIS CHALLENGE WHICH I THINK WE CAN ACCOMPLISH I'M I'M OPTIMISTIC BASED UPON WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST SO. WITH THAT I WOULD THE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. YEAH RIGHT YEAH GREAT WELL THANK YOU SO WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET -- WE WILL CERTAINLY TAKE UP YOUR BILL AND YOUR YOUR BILL OF ENJOY THE D. PASS RECOMMENDATION SO. APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION APPRECIATE YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA OF A SEASON THAT I CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT AS WELL. I'M JUST THE LOGISTICALLY. THIS IS GOING TO JUDICIARY BUT IS OUR TIME TO I MEAN WHAT HAS A WORK OF THEM IT. IT'S LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A WAIVER. OKAY OR IF NOT WE WILL TRY TO HEAR IT. WAS SOME KIND OF ASSISTANCE IS I THINK IT'S BEEN. OFF OF THE FLOOR WHAT. I'M TOTALLY NOT SURE ABOUT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF JUDICIARY FOR THE WEEK YOU KNOW. WHERE WE'RE BACK AGAIN OKAY BUT WE WE MAY HAVE TO COME BACK FOR A OFF THE FLOOR HEARING? YEAH IF IT IF WE DON'T GET A WAIVER WILL BE WILL BE BACK OKAY YOU CAN BE SURE WE WE VOTE DEVELOP THE FAMILY ATMOSPHERE. RATING IN LATE IN THE EVENING FOR RIGHT TO SHERRY I HOPE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BUT IF WE DO WE WILL OKAY THANK OU THANK YOU SO MUCH DO APPRECIATE THANK YOU FOR THE ADVOCATES. OKAY WELL NEXT YEAR FROM CENTER MITCHELL. IN CENTER MITCHELL AS YOU'RE PRESENTING ITEM SIXTEEN IS SB. SIX FORTY SEVEN ARE THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT HAVE ANY SUGGESTED AMENDS FOR YOU SENATOR -- BUT THE COMMITTEE DOES ASK FOR YOUR PROGNOSTICATION ABOUT THE CLIPPERS WARRIORS GAME TONIGHT. AND WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR YOUR READ ON THE ON THE SITUATION OUR HOPE IS THAT THE BILL. WELL I THINK WE'D PREFER A PROJECT FOR US OCCASION FIRST -- CLIPPERS ALL RIGHT THERE YOU GO -- I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMMITTEE FIRST BEFORE. RIGHT NOW ALL I HERE WAS WITH ME. I THINK I'M SAY. A GOOD MORNING COLLEAGUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TO YOU SENATE BILL SIX FOUR SEVEN THE SAFETY JEWELRY ACT THE BILL AIMS TO UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S. METAL CONTAINING JEWELRY Là TO BETTER REFLECT THE CURRENT AND WIDELY ACCEPTED SCIENCE ON THE TOXICITY OF LEAD AND CADMIUM IN JEWELRY. THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT UPDATE IN CALIFORNIA'S METAL CONTAINING YOUR RELY IN ORDER TO PROTECT CHILDREN AND WOMEN FROM THE HARMFUL REST ASSOCIATE WITH LEAD AND CADMIUM IN JEWELRY. IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT EXPOSURE TO LEAD CAUSES REAL AND PERMANENT HARM THERE ARE VOLUMES OF STUDIES IN THE MANY SOURCES OF LEAD EXPOSURE IN THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES. WHAT IS LESS WELL KNOWN IS THAT LEAD IS A COMMON INGREDIENT IN JEWELRY? AND ALSO THAT CADMIUM IS ANOTHER TOXIC METAL COMMONLY FOUND IN JEWELRY CUT. COSTUME JEWELRY. CALIFORNIA'S METAL CONTAINING JEWELRY Là PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND WAS BASED ON SCIENCE THAT WAS AT THAT TIME WELL ESTABLISHED. SINCE THEN THE SCIENCES IMPROVE AND IT'S BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT CALIFORNIA'S LAW IS OUTDATED AND INADEQUATE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANADA THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ALL ENDORSE A MORE RIGOROUS STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL REFLECTS A THOUGHTFUL MEASURED UPDATE TO THE LAW THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE EXPOSURE TO CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE IMPACT ON THE INDUSTRY IN THE FEASIBILITY OF THE LIMITS. SB SIX FORTY SEVEN STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA'S LEAD AND CADMIUM JOE WE LOST BY ESTABLISHING SCIENCE BACK STANDARDS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS IN BOTH NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. ONE THIS BILL ADOPTS THE FEDERAL STANDARD FOR LEAD IN CHILDREN'S JEWELRY WHICH IS ONE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION. ESTABLISHES CADMIUM STANDARD FOR PAINT SURFACE COATING OF CHILDREN'S JORI PURSUANT TO THE ASTM INTERNATIONAL STANDARD WHICH IS LESS THAN. SEVENTY FIVE PARTS PER MILLION. IT AMEND THE DEFINITION OF CHILDREN CHILDREN FIORI TO CONFORM WITH CANADA'S DEFINITION WHICH IS FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. AND FINALLY THE APPLIES THE EUROPEAN UNION LEADS ALWAYS FOUNDED OF LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION FOR ADULT JEWELRY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY IS MORRELL. DE BERNARDO REPRESENTING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFICE. AND HERE AND THROUGH THE LITTLE WHO WAS WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP WAS ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARIO DIBERNARDO I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HOBBY ABBAS THERE IS PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF LEAD AND CADMIUM ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. AND WE KNOW THAT -- CHEAP JEWELRY SUCH AS COSTUME JEWELRY AND CHILDREN'S JULIE I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO CONTAIN LEAD AND CADMIUM. AND THESE TOXIC METALS COULD MIGRATE INTO A PERSON'S BLOOD SYSTEM IF THEY ARE MOUTH OR INGESTED. SO FOR CHILDREN -- THEY CLEARLY CAN DEMONSTRATE ANYONE WHO'S A PARENT KNOWS THAT CHILDREN. ARE CAPABLE OF FREQUENTLY CHEWING ON THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S REALLY OR THEIR PARENTS JEWELRY THEY'RE ALSO STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT -- ADULT TO A VISUALLY NOW THEIR JEWELRY SHOW HIGHER LEVELS OF BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. AND I MEAN IN PARTICULAR FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH -- THEIR IMPACTS ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IT COULD LEAD -- TO LEAD EXPOSURE CAN LEAD TO EARLY MENOPAUSE OR HEALTH ISSUES POST MENOPAUSE. AND SO THESE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS -- SEEING THE FLOW OF ESPECIALLY FROM CHINA -- CHEAP JEWELRY THAT HAS HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD AND CADMIUM MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED STANDARDS TO REGULATE THIS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BROUGHT -- THE CASE AGAINST SEVERAL JEWELRY -- RETAILERS MANUFACTURERS -- TWO DECADES AGO. AND THAT CASE LED TO THE STATE ADOPTING ITS CURRENT STANDARDS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS JEWELRY STANDARDS -- SUBSEQUENTLY BASED ON STUDIES AND MORE INFORMATION THE US CONGRESS CANADA IN THE E. U. ADOPTED STANDARDS THAT ARE ACTUALLY MANY WAYS STRICTER THAN CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT IT LOOS AT THOSE STUDIES AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF FEDERAL STANDARDS AND INCORPORATES MANY OF THOSE STANDARDS INTO CALIFORNIA'S LAW TO UPDATE IT. SO THAT WE ARE HAVING AS MUCH PROTECTION HERE AS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE IN OTHER AREAS OF NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. SO WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK DR A HELLO I'M SUSAN LITTLE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL ALONG WITH THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ATTORNEY GENERAL. JUST WANT TO REMIND THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE'VE DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO REDUCE OF LET X. CHILLS CHILDHOOD LEAD EXPOSURE. AND PARTICULARLY ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP BRAND OF A WHOLE SERIES OF BILLS LAST YEAR. LAST SESSION REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND WANTED TO SET. TO ALSO. REMIND FOLKS THAT JEWELRY IS STILL CONSIDERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BE ONE OF AT CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO GE TO LET A JURY IS ONE OF THE MAIN. RISK FACTORS THAT PEDIATRICIANS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DECIDING WHETHER NOT TO LEAD TEST CHILDREN THIS IS STILL A DOCUMENTED WELL KNOWN -- EXPOSURE PATH THAT CHILDREN HAVE -- IN REGARDS TO LEAD AND THIS IS THIS BILL IS AN EFFORT TO TRY TO JUST GET RID OF THAT EXPOSURE PATH AND MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO LET A JURY IN THE HOME -- OR THE LEGISLATIVE JEWELRY THAT WILL CAUGHT THAT WILL CAUSE THEM HARM -- I ALSO WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE CENTERS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAVE RECENTLY DONE SOME TESTING OF JEWELRY. AND FOUND A FROM THAT THEY GATHER FROM MAJOR DEPARTMENT STORES AND AND RETAILERS NAY FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM. SHE 80% WERE ABLE TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF THIS BILL. AND SO WE THINK THAT'S VERY REASONABLE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS IN THIS REGARDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH LET'S HEAR FROM OTHER FOLKS WANT TO WEIGH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I'M DOCTOR MONA PATEL A PRACTICING PEDIATRICIAN IN LOS ANGELES AND I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. RENDON DAWSON IN SUPPORT OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. HEALTH REPORTER WITH SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN STRONG SUPPORT. THE SEVENTH FLEET BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. JUST NONE FOR THE LOCAL IN BRANCH Là HEALTH DIRECTORS IN SUPPORT WE SUPPORTED THE ORIGINAL BILL MANY YEARS AGO AND WE GLAD TO SEE THIS UPDATE THANK YOU. AND ONE FINAL JUST THAT CENTERS FOR A TUESDAY THE CLEAN WATER ACTION IS ALSO IN SUPPORT. OKAY THANK YOU. GREAT WELL OUR THE IT'S OVER SEC. OTHER OPPOSITION ANY FOLKS ONE WAYS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY IRA AND IT WAS IN THE RESTAURANT POSITION -- OKAY TO THE ITEMS BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS SPOTS -- THEN I WOULD ASK [inaudible] SOME. THE STAFF REPORT [inaudible] FIVE SAID. LEAD IN CANTON -- EXPOSURE CANNOT HAPPEN FROM SKIN. THROUGH THE SKIN IT'S IT'S GOT TO BE IN THE MOUTH WAS THE CANADIAN STUDY OR THE EUROPEAN STUDY. SHOW THAT THE TWEENS HAVE THIS PROPENSITY TO PUT. THIS JEWELRY INTO THEIR MOUTH AND THAT'S WHY THEY MOVED TO STANDARDS OF FIFTEEN YEARS. I MEAN I KNOW THERE'S A NERVOUS CROWD THE SO THE CANADIAN. REGULATIONS. FOCUS ON THE MARKETING DEMOGRAPHIC -- FOR TWEENS AND YOUNG TEENS -- THE FEDERAL STANDARD THE US CUT BACK THE CONGRESS ADOPTED AND IN THE UNITED STATES HAS -- JURIES -- CHILDREN'S JEWELRY THRESHOLD OF AGE TWELVE SO CAñADA LOOKED AT THE U. S. STANDARD OF AGE. TWELVE BUT FOUND THAT THE SINCE THERE IS THIS BUTSINCE THE INDUSTRY MARKETS TO THIS TWEEN YOUNG TEAM GROUP THAT RANGES BETWEEN. TEN AND FOURTEEN BE EASIER TO DECIPHER WHAT IS INTENDED. FOR THE AGE GROUP THAT THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED BY -- BY FOLLOWING THE INDUSTRY STANDARD AND LOOKING AT THEIR HARD LINE OR THEIR YOU THEIR MARKETING PRACTICES OF TARGETING PEOPLE UNDER. FIFTEEN AND THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR ENFORCEMENT -- A LITIGATOR BOB UP A PLAINTIFF. COULD MORE EASILY PROVE THAT. JEWELRY IS INTENDED FOR THE TWEEN OR YOUNG TEEN MARKET BASED ON THE MARKETING AND AN INFORMATION LIKE THAT -- RATHER THAN JUST. A NUMBER THAT DOESN'T NEATLY FIT WITHIN THE INDUSTRY'S MARKETING'S. RIGHT IN WITH IT BESIDES THE MARKETING THAT MAKES SENSE WAS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE. PEOPLE GO THROUGH LIFE PUTTING STUFF IN THEIR MOUTH SO I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE BUT IS IT IS IT THE THE TWEENS THAT WHERE THE JEWELRY THAT THEY'RE NERVOUS. NERVOUS SIR I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SAY JUST -- I GUESS I THINK THIS. MORE INCLINED TO PULL IT UP AND JUST AND AND SUCK ON IT OR DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT I GUESS WAS THERE -- OTHER THAN THE MARK THE TARGET OF THE POPULATION TO WEAR THE JEWELRY WHICH IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AGE BRACKET THAT SAID THAT THE YOU KNOW HAVE OFF A PROPENSITY LIKE A THREE YEAR OLD BUT STUFF IN THEIR MOUTH. I WILL THERE ARE STUDIES THAT THAT FOCUS ON OR INCLUDE -- OBSERVATIONS ON ADULTS MAPPING TOOL OR A AND SO I MEAN. THERE IS CERTAINLY WITH CHILDREN -- AND WHERE YOU DRAW THAT LINE IS UP FOR DEBATE AND AS THERE'S A SPLIT IN JURISDICTION. CHILDREN HAVE THE DAY ARE ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND SO THAT'S WHY -- THERE ARE HEIGHTENED STANDARDS FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE DEVELOPING AND CERTAINLY CHILDREN THAT. ARE YOU KNOW IN THEIR YOUNG TWEENS AND YOUNG TEENS ARE ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP SO -- SO THAT THE THE INFORMATION SUPPORTS THAT. IF YOU WANT THE MOST PROTECTIVE STANDARD FOR THOSE THAT ARE. ARE DEVELOPING STILL THE FEW MOVING BEING A BEYOND FIVE AND SIX YEAR OLDS AND WE'LL GET AGO AT LEAST THE FEDERAL STANDARDS TWELVE THE CANADIANS YOU SEE AND THIS IS THE MARKETING THE TARGETING. I IT MORE ELASTIC IF I HAD ONE MORE THING SO IF YOU GO TO MACY'S. RIGHT DOWN THE STREET HERE AND GO TO THEIR COSTUME JEWELRY DISPLAY ON A COUNTER. THE LOOK THE JEWELERY TYPICALLY INCLUDES A LABEL THAT SAYS NOT INTENDED FOR TWELVE AND UNDER AND THE U. S. AND CHILDREN. FIFTEEN UNDER IN CANADA AND SO THE INDUSTRY'S ALREADY ADAPTING TO THAT FIFTEEN YEAR OLD STANDARD IT'S AN ODD LABEL TO SUGGEST THAT US CHILDREN ARE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT THE CANADIAN CHILDREN. THIS BRINGS THIS WOULD BRING IT IN LINE WITH THE PRACTICE THAT THE IN THE OBSERVING. WELL I HAVE A SIX MONTH OLD WHO JUST. EVERYTHING YOU DO EVERYTHING IT'S WITHIN HIS REACH WILL WILL AND FIND ITS WINDOWS MOUTH SO I'M I'M INDIVIDUAL FINEST AS WOMEN DO WHEN WHEN WERE HOLED UP.

TWELVE YEARS AGO THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION PROPOSED A PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR A VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE FIRE PREVENTION STRATEGY. THE KEY OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM WERE TO PREVENT LOSS OF LIVES AND PROPERTY. REDUCE FIRE SUPPRESSION COSTS AND PROTECT NATURAL RESOURCES FROM DAMAGING WILDFIRE THROUGH THE USE OF APPROPRIATE VEGETATION TREATMENTS.

THIS LANGUAGE OF PROVIDE FOR A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR AWARDING ATTORNEY'S FEES FOR THOSE INFILL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. ARE THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY PROVIDED FOR IN EXISTING LAW. AS WE ALL AWARE CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCING HOUSING CRISIS MANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STRUGGLED TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

UNFORTUNATELY MANY PROJECTS ARE FORCED TO DELAY CONSTRUCTION IN BATTLE IN COURT WHEN A LAWSUIT IS FILED UNDER SEEK WHAT. IN THE GOVERNOR STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS WE HEARD HIS CALL. FOR A SEEK WORK REFORM. THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT INTENDED TO DISCOURAGE GROUPS OR CREATE A CHILLING EFFECT. TO PREVENT LEGITIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR ON THAT.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN RISK MANY BRENDA WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE COMMITTEE INTO THE OUT THERE FOR FOR THE AMENDMENTS -- I THINK THERE ARE TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT -- I NEVER. IN ANY ITERATION OF THIS BILL THOUGHT THAT IT WAS PARTICULARLY APPLICABLE TO THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OTHER. LAW FIRM TYPE -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ABLE TO ASSESS THEIR AT THAT HAVE A ORGANIZATIONAL MANDATE. TO TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ABLE TO FULLY ASSESS THEIR CASES. OUR CONCERN IS ALWAYS THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE MOST DISRUPTIVE FOR AND MOST -- DISSUADING TO THE LOCAL. LOCAL GROUPS TO THE SMALL -- TO THE TO THE LOCAL. LANDOWNERS WERE NEIGHBORHOODS AND AND THE SMALLER GROUPS IN THE CITIES AND AND LOCATIONS WHERE THESE -- WHERE WHERE THE SEATS MIGHT BE BROUGHT THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST -- DISSUADED BY THE THREAT OF HAVING THE REPERCUSSIONS THAT WERE INITIALLY STATED I FEEL LIKE SOME OF THAT MESSAGES STILL EVEN WITH STILL CARRIED INTO THIS BILL AGAIN. NOT FOR MY ORGANIZATION OR THE OR THE IT'S CALLED THOáT THE LARGER LEGAL -- ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS BUT DEFINITELY STILL OF THE MESSAGE STILL CARRIES -- TO THE SMALLER ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT STILL MIGHT WANT TO BRING THE USE THAT MIGHT NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND. ALL THE REPERCUSSIONS IN THE LIMITATIONS ON THIS BILL AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CAUTION I WOULD STILL LIKE TO BRING TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT DOESN'T ZERO CALIFORNIA WILL HONOR SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF CVD -- WERE ALSO KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT THE BRIGHT LINE ROLLED OUT OF INFILL DEVELOPMENT INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND STODDEN BARMAN REPERCUSSIONS AND EVEN THOUGH -- SOME MAY THINK THAT IT'S A MERITORIOUS TO BRING LITIGATION AGAINST INFO DEVELOPMENT HOLISTICALLY -- THEY STILL HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL REPERCUSSIONS THAT -- MIGHT NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN EXEMPTION PROCESS AND SO. COMMUNITY SMALL COMMUNITY GROUPS CAN BRING THOSE CASES MERITORIOUS LEE AND STILL NOT UNDERSTAND THE REPERCUSSIONS OF NECESSARILY HAVING TO BRING FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS -- EVEN HEN THERE ARE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT REPERCUSSIONS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS AND IF OF THIS ONE IF THE SENATOR WANTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THOSE IT ATTORNEY FEES STATUTES ALREADY THEN THAT SHOULD BE IT BUT WE DON'T THINK SB SIX FIVE NINE IS NECESSARY. TO KIND OF A BRING THAT CONVERSATION FORWARD THANK YOU FOR THAT YEAH. WAS THERE A MERRILL WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS WE HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION OF WITH THIS BILL AND IN PRINT CURRENTLY -- AND WILL BE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS BUT STILL HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS GIVE. THE ATTACKER THE CONSUMER DURING THE CALIFORNIA STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BILL IMPRINT BUT WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS AND GET BACK TO MEMBERSHIP THANK YOU. MY NAME'S ALAN LEVINE -- REPRESENT BECAUSE ACTION GROUP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANNA REMIND THE SENATORS THAT SEQUOIA IS A PROCESS THAT IS. DESIGNED TO BRING THE PUBLIC AND TO INFORM DECISION MAKING PROCESS. IF A MEMBER OR A GROUP IN THE PUBLIC. SEIZE THE SPECTER. OF POTENTIAL HI THE HIGH COST OF LOSING LITIGATION THEY WILL BE THIS WAY THAT FROM TRYING TO ENFORCE A PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE IN CALIFORNIA SO I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT [inaudible] OKAY. I KNOW I WILL SAY I MEAN THE THE YOU KNOW THE DID EVERYTHING UNDER THIS BILL IT DOESN'T JUST AWARD FEES. BECAUSE YOU LOSE ARE YOU THERE HAS TO BE A PRETTY HIGH FINDING BY THE JUDGE -- THE MERE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO PAY THOSE COSTS WILL TO SCARE PEOPLE OUT OF PARTICIPANTS. OKAY I THE ITEM IS NOW BEFORE THE COMMITTEE -- FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS THOUGHTS EIGHT I DO HAVE ONE LOGISTICAL QUESTION ON YOU WE JUST SEVERED THROUGH YOU KNOW A LATE NIGHT AT JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I'M. WHAT THE THIS IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO JUDICIARY? WITH THE IMMENSE I'M. WHAT'S LOGISTICALLY RELIGIOUSLY HAPPENS IS THEY'RE GONNA I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A GO OFF THE FLOOR FOR IT JUDICIARY. TO GET THIS PASS UP THIS WEEK OR YEAH. SO WE CAN DO IT TUESDAY NEXT WEEK I UNDERSTAND OKAY ALL RIGHT. UNDERSTAND OKAY QUESTIONS THOUGHTS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE AS CENTER CASKEY. I MONTH I'M LOOKING AT THE STAFF REPORT THAT AT TALKED ABOUT THE DOESN'T HAVE THE WORD CLAIM SENATE -- THAT'S ADDED. EDUCATE ME ON BOND WHAT ADDITIONAL -- PARAMETERS THAT THE COKE COURT COULD LOOK AT TO AWARD ATTORNEY FEES UNDER JUST THE CLAIMS NOT A ACTION OR TACTIC. WELL I I THINK I THINK THE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A STEP BACK IN AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT -- THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR THAT THIS DOES NOT. IS NOT DESIGNED TO DISSUADE -- SEE WHAT CHALLENGES -- ON THE MERITS AT ALL -- WE DON'T WANT THE LITTLE GUY TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME. IF IF -- IF YOU'RE SHE WERE TO BRING OR AN INSTITUTION WHERE TO BRING -- A CAUSE OF ACTION -- OR CLAIM -- ON UNDER -- SOME SORT OF SECRET CHALLENGE. I THINK THE IDEA IS SOMETIMES IT IS BEEN LOOKED UPON AS A TOOL -- TO EXTRACT CONCESSIONS. OUR WITH THE THREAT OF DELAY TACTICS IN JUST THE THE MERE THREAT OF OF OF SECRET CHALLENGE CAN SOMETIMES -- STOP PROJECTS IN THEIR TRACKS. I THINK THE IDEA THOUGH IT IS. WE DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE MERITORIOUS CLAIMS IN THE BAR AS CHAIRMAN INDICATED IS SO SO HIGH. FOR A JUDGE TO DETERMINE THAT SOMETHING IS. IN BAD FAITH OR COMPLETELY WITHOUT MERIT BUT YOUR YOUR QUESTION ON CLAIMS. THE WEATHER ITS TACTICS OR ITS ITS ITS CLAIMS IF YOU'RE BRINGING SOMETHING THAT IS WHOLLY ON RELATED -- TO A PARTICULAR SEQUEL ACTION -- I MAYBE IT YOU KNOW I'M JUST THROWING OUT AS HYPOTHETICAL YOU KNOW WHAT TITLE NINE ACTION FOR EXAMPLE -- HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UNDERLYING LAND USE ISSUE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO LEGAL SUBSTANCE WHATSOEVER BUT GET IT WILL FORCE. THE RESPONDENT ON TO ENCOURAGE TO ORDER LEGAL COSTS -- THROUGH REPRESENTATION AND TAXPAYERS HAVING TO HAVE COURT SYSTEMS -- HANDLE THIS TYPE OF OVERHEAD SO I THINK IT WAS A VERY FAIR AND BALANCED WAY THAT. IT LOOKED ALLOWS PEOPLE TO MOVE FORWARD -- WITH SEQUEL BECAUSE IT IS WE WANT TO PROTECT SEQUEL DON'T GET ME WRONG WE WANT TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF SICK WHEN THE PURPOSE. WE JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S WAYS THAT -- WE CAN IMPROVE THE PROCESS. YEAH I MEAN FOR BETTER FOR WORSE SEEK WAYS YOU'RE ONLY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS TO GO TO COURT SO WE AND WE SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THERE ARE OTHER MECHANISMS AND IN. THE I PLAINTIFF MAY BE UNSATISFIED WITH THE PROCESS THAT THE LEAD LEAD AGENCY THE LOCAL AGENCY USED IN THE IN THE IN PROCESSING OF OUT OF IT AND THEY HAVE A CLAIM. THAT MAY BE A PROPERTY RIGHT OR WHATEVER THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE RELYING ON THAT TO FEEL THEIR ADVERSELY AFFECT WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM. YOU KNOW AND ACTION OR AS A TACTIC THE DAY THE DAY MAY USE SO WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S IT. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY A CLAIM MEANS IT'S SOMETHING THAT I YOU KNOW IT'S PHYSICAL OR ITS ITS ACTUAL AFFECT. IN MONETARILY COULD AFFECT ME. I GUESS THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT CAUSING UNNECESSARY DELAYS. I GUESS SOME DELAYS ARE NECESSARY SUMMER UNNECESSARY BUT THIS IS AND REASONABLE DELAY. TELL ME YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THAT AT THE CHANGE ROM A NECESSARY TO AND REASONABLE I THINK WE WANT TO EMPOWER THE COURTS ARE IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS. AND THE JUDGE HERE SHE WILL BE IN A POSITION TO DETERMINE ON AT BEST WHAT IS A REASONABLE AN UNREASONABLE IN FACT THAT'S ALREADY CODIFIED -- IN DIFFERENT FORMS THROUGH DISCRETION GRANTS TO JUDGE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM SO INHERENTLY IT ALREADY EXISTS. I THINK WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS WE WANTED TO TAKE. UP AN ALREADY EXISTING -- BODY OF LAW. IN A RIGHT FOR ATTORNEYS FEES THAT ALREADY EXIST AND PUT IT ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT. OF INFILL HOUSING TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS THAT SOMETIMES GETS -- SLOW DOWN -- ON REASONABLY. AND I THINK IF THERE ARE MERITORIOUS CLAIMS AS DETERMINED BY A JUDGE -- OR THE THE THE COURT. THOSE ABSOLUTELY ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH WE DON'T WANT TO STOP. BY -- ACTIONS THAT HAVE -- YOU KNOW DEGREES OF MERIT IT'S THE ONES THAT HAVE. ZERO MERIT THAT ARE DESIGNED ONLY TO EXTRACT CONCESSIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED -- TO TO TO HOBBLE A PROJECT WITHOUT LEGAL BASIS. WELL THAT WOULD BE ZERO MERRICK WITH WITH SEEMS TO ME TO BE UNNECESSARY YES THAT WOULD BE IT'S IT'S NOT ASSERT UNREASONABLE MAY HAVE. 10% MERIT OUTLANDISH FOR SOME PEOPLE OF AN INFILL PROPONENT BUT IT'S IT'S A IT'S A HIGHER LEVEL AND AND LESS I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THE UNNECESSARY IN AND REASONABLE RIGHT SO THAT TIGHTENS IT UP A LITTLE -- I I'D BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU IF YOU FEEL THAT -- YOU WOULD PREFER UNNECESSARY -- INSTEAD OF ON REASONABLE -- I'D DEFINITELY BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU TO TO ADVANCES ALONG THE PROCESS I THINK THE THE FOLKS SPOKE OUT ARE SAYING THAT -- YOU KNOW THE PROFESSIONAL -- ENVIRONMENTALISTS S PROBABLY NOT GONNA HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA THEYRE GONNA BRING A CLAIM AND THEIR THEIR LAWYER UP IN THERE OKAY IT'S THE UNSOPHISTICATED -- COMMUNITY GROUP THAT REALLY DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY GOT A FAIR. THERE WAS AN THERE WAS A A MEDICATED ARE MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECK AND THEY FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND THEY DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW IT'S A SMALL INFILL PROJECT AND THEY DON'T FEEL THAT THEY'VE THEY GOT THE RIGHT -- OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE THEIR CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE THAT THE FAST TRACK THAT THEY HAD MET MAYBE GOOD FOR THE PROJECT I I I GET THAT SO. IT WILL SIT AND SOPHISTICATED LOOK -- FOLKS ARE YOU AND I BOTH PRACTICE LAW -- AND USE THE EXAMPLE OF WHEN I CLERKED FOR FOR A JUDGE -- NGUYEN YOU HAD FOLKS THAT REPRESENTED THEMSELVES. IT WAS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THAT THE JUDGE WOULD BE GRANTED -- I CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE UNSOPHISTICATED PETITIONER -- SO I THINK ALREADY IN OUR SYSTEM IT IS BUILT. IN IT'S DESIGNED TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE. AND I THINK IT'S WITHIN YOU KNOW THE NORMAL PRACTICE AND AND CANONS OF THE JUDICIARY -- FOR THOSE -- CONSIDERATIONS TO BE MADE NATURALLY SO I THINK IF YOUR CONCERN IS -- THAT THE LITTLE GUY. IS GONNA BE HURT IN THIS PROCESS THAT'S NOT THE INTENT AND ONCE AGAIN I BIãU MORE THAN WILLING -- TO WORD SMITH THIS IF THE IF YOU'D LIKE TO ENGAGE THIS -- ENGAGE ON THIS MORE DETAIL -- I'D LOVE TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS PROCESSAND BE WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM. MR ONE LAST QUESTION AND IT'S IT'S THE CHILLING EFFECT WELL I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE ARE -- THERE'S AN INVITATION WHEN PEOPLE COME IMPROPER FOR THAT THE KIND GENTLER -- JUDGE TO ADD WORK WITH THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY THEIR HEARD THERE'S OTHERS THAT -- HOURS DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY TIME WITH THIS NONSENSE -- IS INDEED USING THEIR WORDS AND THAT WOULD MAKE A FINDING. TO AWARD ATTORNEY FEES HE WAS A LITTLE SMALL GROUP THAT MAY HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON OTHER FOLKS EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN IN LOS ANGELES BUT THEY KNOW THAT THE YEARS HERE'S THIS ONE CASE WHERE -- THE JUDGE HAS ORDERED ATTORNEY FEES AND THE SMALL ACTIVIST GROUPS THAT MAY HAVE. A LEGITIMATE REASON TO CHALLENGE THE PROCESS OF THE LEAD AGENCY HIS HAS UNDERTAKEN ON THIS INFILL PROJECT WHICH IS WE WANT HOUSING AND ALL THAT TYPE STUFF SO THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE. NO AND I I WOULD SEE I MEAN THE BAD FAITH STANDARD IS A HIGH BAR AND THAT'S WHEN THAT I YOU KNOW I I CERTAINLY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH -- THE EDISON REASONABLENESS STANDARD IS I WONDER WHY I YOU KNOW. I WANTED I WANT TO GRAB WITH ALL OF THE MORE I MEAN WE JUST PROVIDED WITH THESE A MAN'S -- I AM WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD GO TO JUDICIARY I YOU KNOW I WE'RE ALL IN JUDICIARY ALL THREE OF US. AND SO I MEAN I I SUPPOSE I I WOULD WANT YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING OF THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT AND YOU KNOW AND AND AND I THINK FOR US -- TO TO KIND OF EXPRESS I'M FULLY COMFORTABLE WITH THE BAD FAITH STANDARD I I THINK THAT IS HIGHER THAN REASONABLE ST I'M I'M AYE AYE I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I JUST -- WOULD WANT. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS AND I THINK I I WOULD BE LESS COMFORTABLE PASSING THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE IF IT WERE NOT GOING TO DO THIS NEXT. I FOR FOR FOR A MORE ROBUST EXAMINATION OF WHAT THAT WOULD ENTAIL -- BUT I I DO YOU. I MEAN I I DO TEND TO BE SOMEONE WHO. IS PRETTY SUPPORTIVE OF GIVING JUDGES DISCRETION I THINK THAT IN THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS YOU'RE ABLE TO DETERMINE. THIS THE DIFFERENT. FACTORS AT PLAY AND AND SO ON I I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN OUR JUDICIARY AND I I FEEL I WAY ON ALL THE BILL REFORM ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT I'M. SO I THAT'S WHY I HAVE YOU KNOW BEEN OPEN TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK. AND LET'S CONTINUE LOOK OUT LET'S CONTINUE IF WE FIND THAT -- THAT -- THE THE WORD ON REASONABLE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK -- IS ACCEPTABLE DOWN THIS PROCESS THAN. CERTAINLY WORK WITH YOU AND I WOULD WOULD CONSIDER OF REMOVING IT. OKAY SO LET'S LET'S CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION AND AND SO JUST. SO WHAT JUST. AYE AYE WE WERE ASKED. THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE. I IT READS. THE US SENATE BILL SIXTY NINE WITH AUTHORIZED THE COURT TO WHERE TO TURN THESE FEES TO THE PREVAILING PARTY. THAT IS A RESPONDENT OR REAL PARTY IN INTEREST. WHEN THE COURT FINDS THE PETITIONER USED ACTIONS TACTICS OR CLAIMS MADE ON REASONABLY OR IN BAD FAITH THAT ARE FRIVOLOUS OR INTENDED TO CAUSE UNNECESSARY DELAY? THIS LANGUAGE WOULD PROVIDE FOR DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR AWARDING ATTORNEY'S FEES FOR THOSE INFILL HOUSING DEVELOPER OBJECTS THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY PROVIDED IN EXISTING LAW [inaudible] SO -- THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW FROM THE FROM THE AUTHOR. AND SO THAT'S THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISCUSSION I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THE FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE OPPORTUNITY. TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM SO I'M [inaudible] SO. YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY -- WITH WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING OF OF OF THIS STILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS I'M I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY -- YOU KNOW BUT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE BE A MORE ROBUST EXAMINATION THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT ON WHICH WE ALL SET. AND YOU KNOW I MEAN ULTIMATELY -- BUT FOR ME IT WAS YOU KNOW DOES WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE IDEA OF REQUIRING. THE JUDGE TO OFFER A TO TO AWARD FEES -- WITH A NON STARTER BUT BUT THE AUTHORIZATION. ARE THE GIVES DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE GIVES ME -- I THINK -- A LOT MORE COMFORT [inaudible] AND SO. WITH OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OR OTHER THINGS YOU WANT TO ASK ABOUT OKAY SO WITH THAT YOU CAN MAKE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE WE CAN'T TAKE A MOTION -- BUT OKAY WELL LOOK I WAS GONNA SAY I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- YOU BROUGHT UP YOU IN YOUR YOUR COLLEAGUES BROUGHT UP -- SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I THINK -- I'VE DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS THAT WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD -- A GOOD PRODUCT AND CENTER WHAT CASKEY BRINGS UP SOME SOME GOOD POINTS AND I WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE WHAT -- WHAT HE HAS TO SAY -- AND MAKE AMENDMENTS AS NECESSARY TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF NOT ONLY -- THIS COMMITTEE BUT ALSO JUDICIARY OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU I WAS JUST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE WILL TAKE THAT UP IT COMES UP I THINK THAT WHEN IT COMES UP [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU ITEM NUMBER -- ELEVEN CENTER MORE LIKE IS HERE THIS IS THE CALIFORNIA GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX A SCOPING PLAN. THIS SB. FIVE THREE FIVE OF CENTER MORE LIKE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I BELIEVE THAT -- THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE IS PROVIDED AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE AGREED. TO I HAVE A AMENDMENTS. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. SHE RIGHT HERE. AND THE MEASURE COLLEAGUES A I HAD THE PRIVILEGE -- ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS. TO FIRST AND LISTEN TO PETER DRUCKER IN PERSON WHILE HE WAS STILL ALIVE. WE PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND THIS. THE SAME AS MANAGEMENT GURU -- IMPRESSED ON ME ONE OF HIS NOW FAMOUS QUOTES. IF YOU CAN'T MEASURE IT YOU CAN'T IMPROVE IT. OR YOU CAN'T MANAGE WHAT YOU CAN'T MEASURE [inaudible] THE MEETING. YOU CAN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOUR SUCCESSFUL IN THIS SUCCESS IS DEFINED IN TRACK. WITH WILDFIRES CONTINUING TO BE A PREDOMINANT THEME HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE ONE MISSING COMPONENT. IN THEM IS THERE MASSIVE PRODUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES. IF WE MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GASES THESE COMPOUND FOR RATIONS CREATE. IT WOULD BETTER EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO REDUCE MANMADE WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE. IF WE CANNOT QUANTIFY THE DEVASTATION BY ITS IMPACT ON GLOBAL WARMING THEN THE UTILITIES WOULD BETTER APPRECIATE SACRAMENTO'S INTENT ON HARDENING ELECTRICAL ASSETS. AND THE POTENTIAL FOR UNDER GROUNDING THEM. FOR WHATEVER REASON REMEDIES ARE AVAILABLE TO PREVENT SPARKING OR IGNITING VEGETATION. ONE HEADLINE IN DECEMBER STATED CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES HAVE RELEASED EMISSIONS EQUAL TO ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT MILLION TONS. OF CARBON DIOXIDE THIS YEAR. SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON SENATE BILL FIVE THREE FIVE OKAY THANK YOU AND AND I AND WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE. YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I MEAN I THINK ON THAT NOW HOUSES WENT THROUGH. KIND OF A THE DETAILED SENSE OF WHY WE WERE CONCERNED WITH THE ORIGINAL APPROACH -- BUT YEAH THERE'S ABSOLUTE NO QUESTION THAT WILD FIRES ARE. CONTRIBUTING -- TO TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND AND THERE THEY BE NEED TO BE DISCUSSED YOU KNOW TO BE EXAMINED AND AND AND AND EVALUATED AND AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY JUST I DON'T I THINK THERE'S SOME FUNDAMENTAL AGREEMENT ON ON ON ON THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES. AND SO I'M REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE IMMENSE -- TO TO TO TO WORK YOU KNOW TO TO TO ADDRESS I THINK THE CORE ISSUES THAT THE THAT WE ALL KNOW EXIST WITH REGARDS TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ASSOCIATE WITH FIRE SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH ME YEAH [inaudible] OKAY. GREAT OKAY SO I'M. SO WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT SO LET'S ASK. FOR FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO SPEAK OUT IN SUPPORT. YOUR SINGLE BECKY WITH A CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. I ANY FOLKS WHO WANT TO RAISE CONCERN -- THOSE ARE.

AND AND AND VERY PEASED TO SEE THE AMENDMENTS AND DEFINITELY HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO THIS IS. A LOT OF AGENCIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS RIGHT NOW IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS IS. THE MAIN CONCERN THAT WE HAD ALL ALONG WAS NOT TO CONFLATE WILDFIRE MISSIONS WITH ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS AND THAT'S AGAIN SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH WANT TO SEE TO USE THE PARTS OF THANK YOU FOR THE AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU.YEP TO THE RADIUS TO HAVE -- AIR BE PREPARE SEPARATE PORT APART FROM THE SCOPING PLAN IT COULD THEN FORMALIZE THE DATA -- WITH THE COMPANY LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES AND SO THE WAY OF OF GET MORE INFORMATION AND AND AND SUPER IMPORTANT. SO. THANK YOU OKAY I ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO RAISE CONCERNS OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR -- WE WE DO HAVE BEEN A QUORUM YET -- BUT WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE AND PRESENTING AND I'M CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WITH THESE AMENDMENTS GOING TO RECOMMEND IT. DO YOU PASS -- RECOMMENDATION I AND I SUPPOSE IT NOW WILL WOULD GO OFF TO APPROPRIATIONS FROM HERE. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SO MUCH YOUR PRESENTATION ACTOR. IN SESSION I SEE THAT CENTER HUESO HAS COME -- MEMBERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WE WILL GO TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN THIS IS. I NEVER EIGHTEEN SB SIX SIX SEVEN GREENHOUSE GASES RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES GOOD MORNING SIR -- ALRIGHT THEN YEAH [inaudible] THERE WILL. OFTEN IN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE LAST PAGE OF THE ANALYSIS ERA. THANK YOU. FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB SIX SIX SEVEN THIS IS A BILL WAS WHICH SIX TO SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTION. JURISDICTIONS. AS THEY WORK TOWARD MEETING OUR ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING GOALS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE CAL RECYCLE. ON OR BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE FIVE YEAR STRATEGY TO MEET THE STATE'S ORGANIC WASTE. AND DIVERSION GOALS BY SUPPORTING ORGANIC WASTE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE CAL RIGHT. THE CAL RECYCLE IN THE TREASURE TO COORDINATE WITH THE STATE OF NEVADA. OREGON AND WASHINGTON ON INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING TO SUPPORT REGIONAL RECYCLING NEEDS. SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF INTERSTATE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE MARKETS NECESSARY FOR THESE RECYCLED. MATERIALS -- WE HAVE A JOHN KENNEDY WITH RURAL COUNTIES. REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE SOME COMMENTS. OKAY -- WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING -- JOHN KENNEDY WITH ROLE -- CALIFORNIA -- WE SEE THIS BILL IS A VITAL LOOK AT ALL THE COMPLY WITH SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT WAS A BILL PASSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO. IT REQUIRES THE STATE -- 75% ORGANIC WASTE BY -- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE POWER CYCLE THE DOCKING IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS THAT WILL HAVE FOUND THE FACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- OUR CYCLES ANTICIPATING REX COULD COST UP TO TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT. EVEN IF WE GET SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED. WITH THE RAGS THAT STILL MEANS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS JUST TO MEET THIS THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL WILL HELP US GET THERE BY PROVIDING SOME CLEAR DIRECTION TO POWER CYCLE TO IDENTIFY THE TECHNOLOGIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NEEDED. AND DEVELOP A FINANCING -- PLANNED TO IDENTIFY THE TYPES OF FINANCING FUNDING THAT'S REQUIRED TO HELP US COMPLY WITH THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIREMENTS SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WE THINK THIS IS A WIN WIN WIN TO HELP US ACHIEVE OUR ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING REQUIREMENTS. TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMPLY WITH THOSE MANDATES AND THEN FINALLY TO INCREASE IN STATE JOBS. SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX SIX SEVEN PLEASECOME FORWARD.

AND WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT AND AND YOU KNOW LAST YEAR -- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FILED SUIT AGAINST. THE I. B. W. C.. ON ON THE TIJUANA RIVER CLEANUP-- WE ALSO -- WORKED ON A BILL -- TO START A PLANNING PROCESS THAT WOULD. ALLOW FOR THERE TO BE A SOLUTION ON THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY. SO WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK IN AND THAT THE QUAN A RIVER VALLEY -- A RAMS OUR SIDE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST -- THREATENED. IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL SITES IN THE WORLD. NOW IT'S OF A VERY IMPORTANT -- ECO SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE AT THE BORDER OF WHICH THE HAS FACED -- VERY LITTLE POSITIVE IT ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALL THIS BILL. OF FIRST OF ALL OF IS IS A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME MUCH NEEDED RELIEF. TO A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY DECADES AND DECADES OF OF OF AN ENORMOUS POLLUTION AND RUNOFF. THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AROUND THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY ARE ALL IN MY DISTRICT AND THEY HAVE BEEN PLAGUED BY THIS PROBLEM. I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING -- THE COMMITTEE AGAIN AND AND FOR WORKING FOR MY OFFICE AND MAKE SURE THIS BILL -- IS IS SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING ACHIEVING ITS OBJECTIVE. AND I'D ALSO LIKE -- TO EXCEPT AMENDMENTS ADMIN PROPOSED TO MAKE THE BILL MUCH BETTER -- THIS BILL AGAIN WOULD WOULD -- HELPED IN THIS UP [inaudible] UP. PROCESS THAT ENSURES THAT -- WE CONTINUE -- TO RESTORE THIS IMPORTANT VALLEY THAT WE WORK TO STOP THE THE UNNECESSARY RUNOFF THE RUNOFF COMING THROUGH THIS VALLEY IS. IS PRETTY MUCH THE RESULT OF A PLUMBING PROBLEM. IN MEXICO THAT CAN BE RESOLVED WE CAN BE CORRECTED. AND IN THE INTERIM WE HAVE TO TAKE MEASURES TO STOP AT THIS WASTE FROM COMING IN -- TO THIS VALLEY AND THERE'S A WAY TO FILTER. THE THE WASTE -- IT IS ENOUGH SOME INSTANCES WE'VE HAD AUTOMOBILES. COME INTO THE VALLEY FROM MEXICO. WE'VE HAD -- REFRIGERATORS WE'VE HAD THOUSANDS OF TIRES. WE'VE HAD OF STYROFOAM BOTTLES. THERE IS A PICTURE. OF OF OF ONE EVENT ONE RAIN EVENT THE STACKED. BOTTLES AND IF YOU THINK OF ANY KIND OF PLASTIC BOTTLE. OF DETERGENT PLASTIC BOTTLES WATER BOTTLES BEVERAGE BOTTLES. THE IN THIS PHOTO IF I CAN JUST DESCRIBE IT -- THE THE PHOTO IS A ERSON STANDING NEXT TO A PILE THAT'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FEET TALL. OF PLASTIC MATERIAL. THAT INCLUDE BOTTLES AND AND STYROFOAM AND TIRES. THIS IS JUST. AN UNBELIEVABLE BURDEN ON THIS COMMUNITY AND IT'S CAUSING A COULD CONTAMINATION OF ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST BEAUTIFUL BEACHES. IMPERIAL BEACH HAS BEEN FAMOUS FOR SURFING IN INTERNATIONALLY. AND IN MANY CASES -- THE PEOPLE OF MY COMMUNITY CANNOT EVEN RECREATION THE NATURAL NATURAL ENVIRONMENT THEY CAN'T GO TO THE BEACH. WITHOUT THE THE THE THE THREAT OF HEPATITIS. THEY ACTUALLY GIVE SWIMMERS OUT THERE HAVE HEPATITIS SHOTS BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE WATER. AS A PRECAUTION. AND I JUST SHOULD NOT BE IN CALIFORNIA THAT SHOULD NOT EXIST. AND WE HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BIRDS THAT ARE ON THE THREATENED OR ENDANGERED LIST. THAT MAKE THIS -- ENVIRONMENT THEIR HOME. SO I I ASKED OF THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ME AND SUPPORT MY EFFORTS TO TO HELP. CLEAN UP CALIFORNIA HELP PROTECT. THIS OF THE A VERY SENSITIVE -- LOCATION. AND SUPPORT THE PEOPLE OF MY COMMUNITY ABOUT HAVE ACCESS. TO CLEAN WATER IN THEIR OCEANS AND IN THE RIVERS. SADLY THIS USED TO BE YOU KNOW IN IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES WE STILL HAVE THE THE FOUNDATION OUT THERE. OF A OF A SALMON CANNERY. THERE USED TO BE A SALMON CANNERY IN TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY AND THERE ARE SCARCELY. ANY FISH OR ANYTHING THAT CAN MIGRATE UP THIS RIVER BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY DESTROYED. I IT'S HARD TO EVEN. CONTEMPLATE ANY SALMON RUNNING THROUGH SAID HE WILL COUNTY ANYMORE. BUT THINK ABOUT. NOT LONG AGO WE WERE FISHING SALMON IN ABUNDANCE. FROM THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY AND THE ONLY THING YOU CAN FISH OUT OF THAT RIVER NOW IS PROBABLY A TIRE. OR PLASTIC BOTTLE. AND THAT IS A TRAGEDY. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. TO DO A TO REVERSE. DECADES AND DECADES OF HARM TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT HECK ECO SYSTEM AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK LET'S HEAR FROM YOU HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF A SB. SIX NINETY I CAN GIVE THE HI JENNIFER SAVAGE THEIR CREDIT FOUNDATION. THE CALIFORNIA POLICY MANAGER. AND SURRIDER SAN DIEGO CHAPTER IS LONG DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE SITUATION AT THE BORDER AND pON IT IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE PROBLEM FOR DECADES. SO IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN M. AT HALF OF THE BEACHES. ARE THE TWO THAT I SHOULD SAY IN IMPERIAL BEACH WERE CLOSE ON AVERAGE HALF TIME -- DEPENDING ON THE BEACH THEY HAD ONE HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED CLOSURES SUPPORTER FIELD BEACH WITH CLOSE THREE HUNDRED DAYS OUT OF THE YEAR. AND THAT'S IT INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT BLOW NOT ONLY TO COASTAL RECREATIONAL USERS BUT ALSO TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. AND WE KNOW THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE LAST YEAR WERE MADE SICK -- BY SWIMMING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALONE THAT AREA IS THE HIGHLY DISPROPORTIONATE OF WHAT IS ALREADY A TERRIBLE PROBLEM. I'M IN THE US THE US BORDER PATROL WHO HAS. BEEN PARTNERING WITH SURFRIDER HELPING TO PROVIDE TOUR IS DOWN IN THE AREA IF IT DOESN'T ONE MYSELF AND I'M ENCOURAGE ANYBODY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE TO TAKE. ONE I'M AS OF MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY HAD EIGHTY THREE AGENTS WHO WERE MADE SICK -- BY THE POLLUTION DOWN THERE AND THE STATE HAS CONSISTENTLY AND YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM STATE HAS CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED EFFORTS TO SOLVE IT THE PRIOR LEGISLATION IT THROUGH THE CURRENT LAWSUIT. TO THE BUDGET AND THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO AND TO THE WILDLIFE THERE THE CRITICAL WETLANDS. ON HUMAN HEALTH BOTH FOR COASTAL RECREATIONAL USERS SURFERS SWIMMERS EVEN JUST BEACH GOERS IT SO TOXIC YOU CAN'T WALK THROUGH THE ESTUARY WITHOUT IT AFFECTING YOU. I'M AND YOU ARE OF COURSE A U. S. BORDER PATROL. AS WELL AS TO THE CAUSE THE ECONOMY THERE THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS THAT COULD REALLY FINALLY AT LAST DO SOME GOOD -- SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I THOUGHT THANK YOU OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE SB SIX NINETY PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND EVEN GENEVIEVE ABIT ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION AND SUPPORT. LET'S HEAR FROM OPPOSITION OF ANYBODY OPPOSED TO SB. SIX NINETY I WAS CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. THE STAFF REPORT NOTES MEMBERS THAT. THERE IS A BUDGET REQUESTS A PENDING BEFORE SUB TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S A TIGER BUT CHAIRMAN THAT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS WE'RE NOT TALKING MONEY RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST TALKING THE THE BILL THAT. CONTEMPLATES TO STAND DIEGO WATER POURED NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT [inaudible] WITH THAT. SENDER SCANNERS RECOGNIZE A RETURN TO GAVEL BACK HERE. I'M WHEN APPROPRIATE I'LL MOVE THE BILL AND I WANT TO THANK DOCTOR FOR INTRODUCING IT THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY. ON THAT WOULD DO MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE HOPING BUT IS NOT BEING ACTED UPON WHICH SO OFTEN WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE SITUATION OF HAVING.

OKAY YOU'RE A SUBJECT CLOSE. JUST SIMPLY STAYING A SAYING THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN THIS PROCESS WE'VE BEEN WORKING. VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE THE SENEGAL WATER POURED AND THEY HAVE BEEN -- ENORMOUS ADD ADVOCATES AND ALLIES IN THIS EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY OUR ARE LAWSUIT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH. WHO THE PRESIDENT IS THAT THE THAT THE FRANK TRUTH IS THAT WE WE DON'T FEEL THAT? REGARDLESS OF WHO'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE I. B. W. C. HAS NOT BEEN AN ADEQUATE ADVOCATE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL ON OUR BORDER ISSUES FACING MEXICO. AND THERE ARE TREATIES AND THEIR JOB IS TO ENFORCE THEM. AND HOLD -- THE THE THE PARTNERS TO THE STREET IS ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO. WITH THIS BILL WERE WERE SIMPLY TAKING ANOTHER STEP. TO ASK THE THE WATER BOARD SHOULD NEGOTIATE.

AND WE NEED THEM TO FIGHT FOR US AND AND IN A COMBINATION WITH WITH THE LAWSUIT THIS ACTION I THINK WE WILL GET. A LOT MORE FROM THE I. B. W. C. THAN WE CURRENTLY GETTING SO. YOUR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS WOULD WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO THE PEOPLE OF MY COMMUNITY. AT AND TO THIS IMPORTANT VITAMIN THE SERVICE ALL OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER FOR THIS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED ADVOCACY ON THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IF THEY EVEN READ YOU KNOW I WAS. OUT AS I WAS IN.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER SEE THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I WANT TO THANK OF THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF WERE WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH US. I ALSO WANT TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT. RIVER REFERENCE ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. UP. COLLEAGUES THIS BILL IS VITAL TO PROTECTING ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE FROM EVERY RACE AND ETHNICITY. EXPOSURE TO CHLORPYRIFOS BEGINS IN THE WOMB AND CONTINUES WHEN KIDS CONSUME THE FRUITS THE NUTS IN THE VEGETABLE THAT WE AS PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS ENCOURAGE THEM TO EAT. BUT IT PUTS ALL CHILDREN AT RISK OF HARM. THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS HAS BEEN IRREFUTABLE. ABOUT THE NEARLY ONE MILLION POUNDS OF THIS CHILD BRAIN DAMAGING PESTICIDE THE GETS APPLIED EACH YEAR ON OUR CALIFORNIA CROPS. THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CONCLUDES THE RISK THE INFANT AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH DEVELOP AND DEVELOPMENT IS UNAMBIGUOUS. YOU HAVE A LETTER FROM THIRTY NINE SCIENTISTS -- UP TO THIS AFFECT THEY RIGHT THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE CONTINUED USE OF THIS PESTICIDE IS HARMFUL TO BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF DOZENS OF STUDIES THEY TELL US EXPOSURE HAS BEEN LINKED TO ABNORMAL REFLEXES IN NEWBORNS. MENTAL AND PSYCHOMOTOR DELAYS AND PRESCHOOLERS -- DECREASES IN I. Q. ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER AN AUTISM. EVEN SCRIPT STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE BRAIN THE EARLY RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES FORCED THE MAKER OF RAID. S. C. JOHNSON SON. TO REMOVE THIS CHILD BRAIN DAMAGING CHEMICAL FROM ITS PRODUCT ALMOST TWO DECADES AGO. THE EPA UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA RECOGNIZED THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. UP BY PROPOSING TO BAN THIS CHILD BRENT BRAIN DAMAGING INGREDIENT IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION'S EPA CONTRADICTED THE OVERWHELMING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. ON THE CLEAR CONCLUSION OF THE EPA'S OWN SCIENTISTS. BY REFUSING TO FINALIZE THAT BAN IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW THE ONLY WAY CALIFORNIA CAN RESPECT THEY REFUSE TO BOWL SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS BY ENACTED AS BEFORE. FIVE EIGHT THIS YEAR WE IN THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERING GOVERNOR NUISANCE PLAN TO EXPAND EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT WHILE DOING SO THE GOVERNOR MAKES A STRONG AND CONVINCING CASE WHERE THE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF A CHILD'S BRAIN. SB FOUR FIVE EIGHT WILL END CALIFORNIA'S WIDESPREAD USE OF A PESTICIDE INGREDIENT THE DOES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. AMONG THE MEN IN THE BILL'S MANY SUPPORTERS ARE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE UNITED FARM WORKERS AND EARTH JUSTICE WE MUST END. THE MULTI DECADE LONG DELAY OF A BAND OF THIS TOXIC CHEMICAL JOINING ME TODAY ARE TYLER SMITH. STAFF SCIENTIST AT JUSTICE AND GREG GLORIA STAFF ATTORNEY AT EARTH JUST. AND THESE. HELLO GOOD MORNING GERMAN ALLEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TYLER SMITH I'M A STAFF SCIENTIST EARTH JUSTICE WE ARE THE NATION'S LARGEST NONPROFIT APARTMENT A LAW ORGANIZATION. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SENATE BILL FOUR FIVE EIGHT AND WE JOIN THE UNITED FARM WORKERS AND THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS IS CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE CONTINUED USE OF CORPORATE FOSS HARMS THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OF INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. ACROSS DOZENS OF STUDIES EXPOSURE TO CORPORATE BOSTON SIMILAR PESTICIDES. BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH POOR COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN. NOW IS THE SENATOR MENTONED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN US EPA CONCLUDED THAT USING CORPORA FALSE ON FOOD DOES NOT MEET THE FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARD. OF A REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF NO HARM. MAY PROPOSED A BAN THAT WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED NEARLY ALL USES OF THIS PESTICIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN US EPA SCIENTISTS REVIEWED THE STUDIES CITED BY OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL IN THEIR LETTERS TO YOU. AND EXAMINE THE HUNDREDS OF WHERE THE CORPORATE FOSS MAY BE USED UNDER CURRENT LAW. THEY FOUND THAT ALL OF THESE USES RESULT IN UNSAFE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE EVEN WHEN THE HANDLERS FOLLOW ALL OF THE DIRECTIONS ON PESTICIDE LABELS. AND WHERE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. AND THEY FOUND THAT THE CONTINUED USE OF CORPORATE FALLS ON FOOD HARMS THOSE TO BE PERFECT. USES ON FOOD EXPOSE CHILDREN WANTED TO YEARS OF AGE THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TIMES WHAT THE AGENCY CONSIDERS ACCEPTABLE AND MOREOVER YOU WITH THE PS CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL. OF CORPORATE BOSS IN DRINKING WATER. AND YET IN EARLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD NOT FINALIZED THE PROPOSED BAN. THE ADMINISTRATION DISREGARDED THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND LEFT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EXPOSED TO THIS TOXIC CHEMICAL. NOW A COALITION OF HEALTH LABOR AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS THE THROUGH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND US EPA HAS NOT DISPUTED THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY SCIENTISTS BUT INSTEAD IS BASIS LEGAL ARGUMENTS IN THIS LITIGATION ON UNRELATED PROCEDURAL ISSUES. THERE SIMPLY IS NO DEBATE ABOUT THE SCIENCE A CORPORATE BOSS EXCEPT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE MONEY OFF CORPORATE. BUT UNLESS THE LEGISLATURE TAKES ACTION. THIS CHEMICAL WILL REMAIN ON THE MARKET AND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WILL REMAIN EXPOSED WHILE THE FEDERAL LITIGATION CONTINUE. AND IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO RESOLVE THIS LITIGATION EVEN IF THE PLAINTIFFS ULTIMATELY PREVAIL. SENATE BILL FOUR FIVE A WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA A SAFER PLACE FOR KIDS TO LIVE. I HEARD YOUR SUPPORT AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

HI I'M DOCTOR JENNIFER JOHNSON I'M A PRACTICING PEDIATRICIAN AND LOS ANGELES HERE AT THE CABIN. AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS MY SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU ARE SO FOLKS WINERIES OPPOSITION TO THE BILL RAISE CONCERNS [inaudible] SEEING NANA. ALL RIGHT LET'S AREA. HOW YOU DOING THIS TO RENEW? WE HAD TO FOLKS OKAY. I WAS DOING. MISSION. YEAH BUT WHO'S WHO'S WHO'S TAKEN THE LEAD [inaudible] OKAY. THE TWO OF YOU [inaudible] OKAY. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CAROL BURNS AND WITH BIRDS EPIDEMIOLOGY CONSULTING AND I'M RETIRED FROM THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY. I'VE PHD AND A MASTERS IN EPIDEMIOLOGY. I OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL TO BAN CHLORPYRIFOS. FIRST PLEASE DO NOT DISMISS ME BECAUSE I'M A CONSULTANT FOR COULD HAVE A I AM INTRODUCED BELOW CLOSER TO MAKE FURTHER HERE PLEASE DON'T DISMISS IS WITH YOUR CONSOLE THEM. FOR WHATEVER WHATEVER OKAY MARY A THEY ARE THEY USED TO BE DAHLE AGROSCIENCES AND NOW THE THE WORK WITH OR FOR A MANUFACTURER CLICK HERE THAT'S OKAY. SO I WAS PREGNANT WHEN I STARTED WORKING AT THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY AND MY OFFICE WAS ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE THEY MANUFACTURED AND FORMULATED CORPS PURIFY US. ALL THREE OF MY CHILDREN WERE DELIVERED AT THE HOSPITAL WITHIN A MILE OF THIS FACILITY. MY VIEWS TODAY RESULT FROM TWENTY YEARS OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND REVIEWING THE WEIGHT O THE EVIDENCE OF CHLORPYRIFOS NOT FROM MY EMPLOYER. FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION ON CORE PURIFY US. FOR PURIFIES IS AN ORGANIC PHOSPHATE BUT NOT ORGAN ALL ORGAN APOSTATES ARE CLICK HERE FOR US. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TOXICOLOGY AND EXPOSURE PROFILES. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO YOU TO WRITE DOWN THESE ACRONYMS TCP. D. E. P. E. N. D. A. P.. WHEN MEASURED IN YOUR AND T. C. P. IS A SPECIFIC METABOLITE OF CHLORPYRIFOS TRICOR APPEARED IN ALL? D. E. P. IS A METABOLITE OF UP. TO SEVEN OR GALA PHOSPHATES INCLUDING CORPORATE BOSS IN D. A. P. IS A METABOLITE OF UP TO TWENTY INSECTICIDE SO IT'S NONSPECIFIC. TO THE BEST SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE TO COMPARE RESULTS SPECIFIC TO CHLORPYRIFOS AND LOOKING AT RESULTS FOR TCP IN D. E. P.. NOT THE LESS SPECIFIC ON ALL OUR GAL PHOSPHATES IMPORTANT TO COMPARE LIKE WITH LIKE. SECONDLY IN A POINT OF AGREEMENT IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THE DPR REGULATION OF CORPORATE BOSS HAS CHANGED USES. REDUCE DRAFT AND AS A RESULT THE EXPOSURE POTENTIAL HAS DECLINED IN CALIFORNIA. SPEAKING TO THE EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDIES FOR THE MOST PART THE STUDIES ON CHILDREN WERE BORN IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES IN THE FIRST DECADE OF TWO THOUSAND THE NEW YORK CITY STUDIES FROM COLUMBIA AND MOUNT SINAI ARE ABOUT INDOOR APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE NO LONGER REGISTERED. THERE ARE TWO AUTISM STUDIES YOU HEAR ABOUT. A LOT AND BOTH RELIED ON APPLICATION AND RESIDENTS RECORDS FROM THE NINETEEN NINETIES. TO TWO THOUSAND TEN REASSURINGLY THE AUTISM STUDY OF CHILDREN AS REPORTED BY UC DAVIS MOST RECENTLY. FOUND NO LINK OF CHLORPYRIFOS AN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. IN OTHER WORDS DPR HAS ADDRESSED THE CONCERNS OF THIS PANEL. FURTHER THE HOME STUDY IN OHIO CAN DISPEL SOME CONCERNS ABOUT RESIDUE ON FOOD SINCE NO ADVERSE ASSOCIATIONS WERE REPORTED WITH CHLORPYRIFOS LEVELS IN THIS STUDY. THE MESSAGE SO I'D LIKE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT MODERN USE PRACTICES IN DVRS ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA USES. SHOULD BE EVALUATED BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION OF A BAND. IN CLOSING THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SCIENCE LOOKING AT BEST SCIENTIFIC METHODS EXPOSURE LEVEL AND REPLICATION. THE COLLECTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY DATA DO NOT SUPPORT CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIP FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT. IN CORPUS EXPOSURE. I'D LIKE TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT THE POINT ABOUT RESIDUES BEING A HUNDRED AND FORTY TIMES HIGHER THAN USEPA SAFE LEVELS. THIS WAS BASED ON A DRAFT POINT OF DEPARTURE. ON WHICH WAS BASED AND THAT IT WAS DEBATED AND REJECTED AS POOR SCIENCE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION US SCIENCE ADVISORY PANEL. LASTLY INDUSTRY AND D. P. R. ARE PROMOTING PRECISION AGRICULTURE AN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT. BANDS LIKE THE ONE PROPOSED MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF INCREASED RESISTANCE. DUE TO LIMITED TOOLS HIGHER USE OF LEFT LESS EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS AND PRECEDENT SETTING OF SCIENCE BASED PRACTICES FOR DECISION MAKING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU [inaudible] THE THIRD. YEAH MY NAME IS BRIAN NEUFELD. I OWN A FARM MANAGEMENT BUSINESS AND TULARE COUNTY. I DO A CUSTOM FARMING. PEOPLE BY FARMS AS INVESTMENTS IN MY JOB IS. TO GROW THE BEST CROSS THAT WE CAN'T SO I SPECIALIZE IN GROWING TREE CROPS LIKE CITRUS AND NUTS AND VINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME I WAS. BORN IN A FARMING FAMILY AND BUT I STARTED THIS BUSINESS ONE BECAUSE I LIKE FARMING INTO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE GROWN REALLY GOOD CROPS MEAN STUFF THAT WE ALL EAT EVERY DAY EVERYBODY'S IN ALMOST NOW. CUTIES HALOS MANDARINS. THESE THINGS ARE VERY POPULAR THINGS AND AS PART OF OUR INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS WE HAVE JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF TOOLBOX LAUGHTER THINGS THAT WE CAN USE. SO IN MY PARTICULAR CASE I TRY TO UTILIZE AS MUCH BIOLOGICAL. A INSECTS TO HELP US GET OUR JOB DONE BUT FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE TO DO THINGS LIKE SPRAYED WITH. PESTICIDES AND SO I WANT TO RUN DOWN REAL QUICK. THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ASIDE REGULATION REQUIRES -- PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ARE FARMERS I'M NOT A PEST CONTROL ADVISER. I'M JUST A FARMER -- WHICH BY THE WAY I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS CARD THAT. THE P. R. ISSUES MAY AS A QUALIFIED APPLICATOR. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THIS CARD I GOT A TAKEN EXAMINATION AND HAVE TWENTY HOURS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION AND LAWS IN RAGS -- EVERY TWO YEARS -- BUT THIS DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO WRITE A RECOMMENDATION AS A DOCTOR WOULD WRITER RECOMMENDATION FOR APPLYING RESTRICTED CHEMICALS SUCH AS CORPORATE BOSS. SO I HIGHER THE A PEST CONTROL ADVISER. THE WAY THAT THEY OBTAIN THEIR LICENSE IS A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN THIS I MEAN THEY GOT TO GO TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. THEY GOTTA GO TO ABOUT FORTY HOURS A YEAR WORTH OF EDUCATIONAL -- UNIVERSITY SPONSORED TRAINING IN ORDER TO WRITE A RECOMMENDATION SO I GOTTA GET A RECOMMENDATION FROM A LICENSE [inaudible] PROFESSIONAL. THEN I HAVE TO USE MY CARD NOT EVERYBODY CAN GO BY CORPORATE BOSS YOU GOT TO HAVE THIS CARD IN ORDER TO GO DO IT. AND AND I RECEIVED A LETTER LAST NOVEMBER FROM TULARE COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS OFFICE SAYING. WHEN YOU RENEW YOUR LICENSE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL FARM WE'RE NO LONGER GOING TO HAVE FOR PARA FOST? AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO JUST PUT ON THERE. THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN UTILIZE IT IS UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS SO THIS IS ALL NEW TO EVERYBODY AND I WAS CONFUSED WHEN THIS CAME OUT. SO WHEN I WENT TO GO REGISTER. SO HOW COME I CAN'T OF CORPORATE FOR US ON HERE. THIS IS IN A PRODUCT THAT I REALLY USE ANYWAY BUT OCCASIONALLY FROM TIME TO TIME IF I HAVE A A MAJOR PROBLEM ALL USERS SO. THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW IS. IF I WANT TO USE IT I GOTTA GO THE AYE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE I GET A GIVEN VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS AS TO WHAT MY PAST IS AND RIGHT NOW FOR CITRUS. I CAN ONLY USE IT FOR ANSWER I CAN USE IT FOR SALE ADS THAT'S IT. YEAH OKAY SO THE POINT IS IS THAT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF RESTRICTIONS IN PLACERIGHT NOW THAT ARE PROHIBITING GROWERS SUCH AS MYSELF. FROM EVEN WANTING TO USE THIS PRODUCT THERE'S NO NEED TO ELIMINATE IT BECAUSE IT'S JUST ANOTHER TOOL IT'S IN OUR BOX THAT. THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR CROPS. SO I OPPOSE THE THE BILL. OKAY APPRECIATE THAT. OUR OTHER FOLKS WANT TO WEIGH IN OPPOSITION -- CAN RAISE CONCERNS.

YOUR TAKE ON YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT RATE US ON BEHALF OF COURSE HAVE A YEAR AGAINST THESE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE THERE'D PARTICULARLY CONCERNING BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES THE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE SCIENCE BASED SYSTEM FOR REGULATING PESTICIDES THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES. THIS GRANT SO WE HA UNPRECEDENTED AUTHORITY TO IN FACT APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES THAT DPR HAS DETERMINED TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR PARTICULAR PESTICIDE. AND FURTHERMORE THE AMENDMENT IN PARTS OF THIRTY TWO WE HA UTILIZING AN INAPPROPRIATE STANDARD OF PROOF QUOTE CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE WITHOUT PRECEDENT IN THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE COAT. OKAY. I'M MISTER CHAIR FIBERS. STAFF NOW SAYS ONE OF THE ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT A 50% REDUCTION IN THE USE THE OF AND I'LL GET IT. FOR FIVE REFER US BOTH FOR PURE FIVE OR FOR A FIGHT OKAY -- BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHAT ARE THE EPOCHAL LOGICAL STUDIES NOW ON THE USE OF IT BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S IT WAS TRENDING DOWN WHETHER FROM THE OPPONENTS AND THE OPPONENTS ON TODAY'S SCIENCE STUDIES. CHERYL SENATOR IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE P. A. PUT OUT THE ITS LAST RISK ASSESSMENT ON CORPORATE OFF THE FINAL RISK ASSESSMENT. LOOKING AT THE MOST RECENT DATA AND SAYING THAT -- EXPOSURE TO CORPORATE BOSS RESULTS IN UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE TO INFANTS TO CHILDREN. THE WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE CURRENT DATA -- SO BASED ON THE BEST SCIENCE WE HAVE FROM U. S. EPA. AND ALSO THE ANALYSES THAT WERE DONE BY CALIFORNIA DPR -- THE CURRENT LEVELS OF EXPOSURE CONTINUE TO PLACE CHILDREN AT RISK. MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD IF THE RESPECTFULLY -- THE EPA REGULATIONS IN FACT TODAY ARE FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX THAT'S STILL A DRAFT -- BUT WHAT I THINK YOU'RE ASKING IS -- WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE IN EPIDEMIOLOGY FOR THE ROAD THE USE PATTERNS TODAY? BASED ON THAT 50% REDUCTION OF CORPORATE BOSS YOU SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT REALLY I WOULD LIKE TO CITE THE LATEST UC DAVIS STUDY ON AUTISM WHICH FOUND NO EFFECT AT ALL AND THOSE CHILDREN WERE BORN. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT TIME PERIOD OF LOWERED USE. THE STUDIES FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MOUNT SINAI AND UC BERKELEY ARE ALL BASED ON CHILDREN THAT WERE BORN IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT SO THAT'S THAT. WE CAN DEBATE THE CONSISTENCY OF THOSE STUDIES ABSOLUTELY BUT CERTAINLY THE USE PATTERNS WERE DIFFERENT IN CALIFORNIA. AT THAT TIME PERIOD [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] MR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANKS SENATOR RAZA AYE I KNOW IT THIS BILL COMES FROM TO I MEAN JUST. TERMS OF THE HISTORY WE'RE SAYING THE PAST. DOESN'T. MATTER IS A RELEVANT NOW BUT WE KNOW WHAT. WORKING PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR MANY DECADES. WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE EVEN GRANTED CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS OR WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THEY BUILT THIS STATE AND NOW SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES THEY FED US FOR DECADES SO. I'M NOT PARTICULARLY MOVED BY THAT ARGUMENT I'M ALSO I HAVE TO SAY. I'M NOT PARTICULAR INTEREST WITH THE CHEMICALS INDUSTRY HAS TO SAY ABOUT [inaudible] THIS. CHEMICALS BILL -- I KNOW WITH THEIR THEIR MOTIVES ARE GOING TO BE THERE -- SELLING PRODUCT I THINK ON THE WHOLE. BUT I DO WANT TO BRING BACK UP. IF IF THE CITRUS. MY MY FOLKS GROW TANGERINES IN ORANGE INVENTOR ACCOUNT. AND I'M TRYING TO GET BACK FROM MY MOM ACTUALLY AS WE SPEAK. TO INVOKE HER IN THE BILL BUT IN THE HEARING BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK THEY USE -- CHLORPYRIFOS IN IN ANY OTHER TREATMENTS BUT I KNOW THAT A C. PEAS A BIG DEAL. AND THAT PSYLLID. TANK THE ENTIRE FLORIDA'S CITRUS INDUSTRY SO BUT BUT I DON'T LET THAT SORT OF THINK THAT FEAR CLOUD THIS LEGISLATION LET'S LET'S GET DOWN TO IT LET'S FIGURE OUT. IS THIS ACTUALLY USEFUL OR NOT SO IS THERE ANYONE STILL HERE FROM THE CITRUS INDUSTRY JUST GIVES A GENERAL SENSE. YEAH I CAN CAN YOU JUST YOU MIND COMING BACK UP -- JUST SO JUST GIVE US IT GIVES THE ANNOUNCES SAID. IT TALKED ABOUT. WE'RE DOWN. TO JUST OVER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THEN IT SAYS THE THE THE INTERIM RAGS FROM T. P. R. RECOMMENDED. DISCONTINUING ITS USE ON MOST CROPS SO SOON WALK US THROUGH A LITTLE BIT LIKE. WHAT CROPS ARE STILL ALLOWED BY THOSE INTERIM RIGS WHAT WHAT IS THAT LIMITED TREATMENT LOOK LIKE AND YOU SAID YOU TALKED ABOUT LIKE? OTHER PASSED AT OTHER USE OF A I FORGET WHAT YOU CALL -- THE OTHER IN SYNC INSECTS BEEN BENEFICIAL -- YES -- SO FOR A LONG TIME A LARGE VAN WAS USED FOR CALIFORNIA RED SCALE WHICH IS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR A LONG TIME IT'S AN INSECT THAT. LANDS ON YOUR FRUIT IT'S THOSE LITTLE ROUND SPECS THAT ARE ALL OVER YOUR FRUIT. AND YOU KNOW AS OUR CLIENTS GET WARMER AND ALL THAT IT'S BECOME WORSE AND WORSE SO ANYWAYS THAT PRODUCT IS NO LONGER USE FOR THAT. SO THAT WOULD HAVE BESIDES THAT USING EVERY DAY THOUGH IT WE CAN EITHER USE IN COURT YOUR FAUCET OUR WE'RE NOT NO NAY PACK I HAVE AND USE IT IN OVER THREE YEARS. BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO USE BUT I CAN STILL USE AND THAT'S THE POINT IS THAT. IT WITH A C. P. IS A HUGE PROBLEM ESPECIALLY WHEN HLB SHOWS UP LIKE YOU SAID TWO THIRDS OF FLORIDA INDUSTRIES WIPED OUT AS A RESULT OF THIS. WINTER IS THE HEIGHT OF IT SO THIS IS A CHEMICAL THAT WE CAN USE TO WIN DO YOU WANT TO USE IT THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M CURIOUS THANK YOU SEE IMEAN USED FOR THREE YEARS. MY ONLY USE ONLY I NEED TO USE IT WHEN IT'S A BECOMES A PROBLEM. I DON'T WANT MY VARIOUS VERSUS SOME OTHER CHEMICAL WHEN THEY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY OPTIONS WELL WHAT ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES THE THE IN THE LITTLE RED BUGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT ELSE OUT THERE WELL THE ONLY THING THAT STRETCHES FOR IS. AUNTS AND FOR ACP THAT'S IT. I'M SAYING SAYS I CORPORATE FOSTERS A WHAT ELSE YOU USING IN THE INTERIM TO DEAL WITH A C. P. OR WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT FORTUNATELY WHERE WE'RE AT AND CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVEN'T HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT YET WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP IT SOUTH OF YOU KNOW. RIGHT OUT OF IT MAYBE SOMEONE CAN CALM ON THE NAKED TONIGHT TO BE THAT WAS THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD A COUPLE YEARSAGO WHEN I WAS. WORKING ON THAT ISSUE AND IT YEAH I DON'T I FATHERS FOR COMPANY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S BY LIKE I WAS VERY CAN MEAN. WHAT WE DO IS IN UIX OR IS IT? OR IS IT. IS IT IS YOU KNOW CORPORATE I'VE IT WHAT WHAT'S HAS - SO ON ON THAT ACCOUNT I MEAN. OUR UNIVERSITIES HAVE PUT OUT THESE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS WHICH MEANS THAT HERE IS. A AY TO UTILIZE CHEMICAL CHEMISTRIES TOGETHER. THE BEST CONTROL PASS AND ALMOST EVERY GROWER NOW IS USING THESE THINGS GIVEN THE INCREASED COST OF PESTICIDES ALL I MEAN YOU HAVE. TO SO. YOU HAVE IT'S YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF TOOS IN YOUR BOX THAT YOU CAN YEARS. AND IF WE'RE ELIMINATING THESE. I GOT YOU I JUST WE CAMPOS I CAN'T SIT HERE PUT HAS TO HELP PEOPLE RIGHT LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA. FLY IN THIS COMMITTEE -- OR I DON'T THINK IN THIS LEGISLATURE WILL SEE WHERE THINGS AND UP BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OKAY IF IT'S A MATTER COST. HOW DO WE HELP YOU GUYS GET THERE RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN BREAKING THE CITRUS INDUSTRY OR AN OUTBREAK OF OURS  DON'T HEAR THAT FROM THE AUTHOR? RIGHT WE DON'T SO SO WHAT'S THIS OTHER PATHS START TO LOOK LIKE WE'RE DOWN FIFTH WE'RE DOWN OVER THOUSAND POUNDS. WHAT ELSE IS BEING USED HELP ME OUT HERE WHAT WHAT OTHER WHAT OTHER CHEMICAL TREATMENTS OUT THERE? OR NOT IT SORT OF I MEAN NO ONE LIKES PESTICIDES PERIOD RIGHT THIS IS ALWAYS A TOUGH CONVERSATION HAVE -- BUT THE TECHNOLOGIES HAD TO OF ALL I MEAN WE'VE GOT OTHER THINGS ON THE SHELVES BESIDES YOU WOULD THINK THAT BUT THERE IS. THAT YOU DON'T EVEN USE IT. YEAH WELL IT'S BECOME BURDENSOME TO USE IT. BUT THE BUT THE THE REGULATIONS ON THE USE OF THE PRODUCT. ARE PROHIBITIVE OBJECTS USING IT WELL HAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST BRAIN WHEN WE WANT TO SPRAY WE CAN'T JUST DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO I GOT TO WORK WITH OUR AG COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. I DO IT I'M DONE. I GOT YOU I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OTHER CHEMICAL APPLICATIONS OUT THERE IS THE CITRUS INDUSTRY USING BESIDES CORP HERE FOSS TO PREVENT HLB. FOUR IT'S NOT PREVENTING HLB IT'S IT'S THIS ORDER ATTACK IT IS. TO INSECTS FINE THE TICKET KELLY C. P.. THE KILL SELLERS WHAT ELSE WITH WHAT OTHER CHEMICALS ARE OUT THERE THAT THE INDUSTRIES USING RIGHT NOW. ALL OF A THREE OR FOUR OTHER CHEMICALS THAT WE CAN HEAR LIKE WHAT. I KNOW I HAVEN'T HAD TO SPRAY FOR YET. AS ANY DID ANYONE IN HERE HAVE ANYMORE INFORMATION THERE YEAH LAURENCE SORRY I I THAT I JUST. YEAH I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE NITTY GRITTY THANK YOU SENATORS SO -- THE CHERRIES CORRECT NEONICOTINOIDS ARE THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE AND THAT'S WHAT'S MOST USED WHEN IT'S COME TO COMBATING ACP AGENTS THAT ARE STILL IN TRYING TO KEEP IT OUT OF COMMERCIAL GROVES. THAT'S IS BEING USED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO FIGHT IN THE BACKYARDS SO THAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE RIGHT NOW THERE'S ALSO -- WE'RE TRYING WITH THE WASPS BUT UNFORTUNATELY TAMARIX CO AS FAST AS THEIR BREEDING THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP UP. SO THOSE ARE THE ALTERNATIVES WERE LOOKING FOR WE'RE LOOKING FOR TERRORISTS YET. ARE GIVE ME THAT ONE AGAIN SO IT WAS TAMARIX YOU IT'S A LITTLE LAS HOW THAT'S THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL YES AND IF YOU KNOW WE WOULD LOVE IT IF WE COULD JUST. USE THESE WASPS EAT UP THE BUG AND BE DONE WITH IT BUT THEY JUST CAN'T. THE BASS NUMBER LOGICAL NOT ENOUGH THE NEAR NEXT WHICH I KNOW THERE'S OTHER CONCERNS ABOUT IN THE POLLINATOR POPULATION FOR THOSE WE'VE HAD SOME OF THOSE BILLS THAT PASS BUT SO IN. THOSE THE ONLY. TWO THOSE ARE REALLY THE ONLY TWO THAT ARE EFFECTIVE BESIDES CORPORATE VICE THEIR **** WE'RE LOOKING FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES THERE'S SOME RESEARCH BEING DONE AT UC RIVERSIDE RIGHT NOW TRYING TO FIND SOME THINGS TO DO. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IN CALIFORNIA WERE THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS A DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT MEANS NO MATTER WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES CALIFORNIA MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE BEFORE IT GETS HERE BUT WHAT THAT DOES DO IS IT EXTENDS THE TIME AND THE COST FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO MAKE ITS WAY INTO CALIFORNIA'S MARKET PLACE. AND IT COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO GET THESE THINGS THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS. I'M TO MAKE IT TO THE MARKET AND IT CAN BE TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROCESS AND WITH THE PR SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE OF THESE ALTERNATIVES. BUT IT TAKES SUCH A LONG TIME WHAT LONG AMOUNT OF TIME AND IT'S SUCH A LARGE INVESTMENT. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO STILL PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. AND ALSO GET THESE ALTERNATIVES IN HERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THAT YET BECAUSE WE NEED WE STILL NEED. TO BE MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE SCIENCES CORRECT IN BEING DONE BEFORE IT EVER GETS RELEASED INTO THE MARKET BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'S HARD AND SO WHILE. FARMERS AT THE TIME I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT WHEN YOU'RE SAYING TOO LONG OF A LAG TIME BUT I MEAN I KNOW EVERYONE'S HUSTLING FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THEIR DITCHES INDUSTRY. TO TRY TO GET SOMETHING SOME OTHER SOLUTIONS TO MARKET LIKE I I DON'T HEAR YOU GUYS SAYING YOU WANT TO USE THIS HE SAID HE DOESN'T EVEN USE IT NOW IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE PESTICIDES IS KIND OF A LAST RESORT PESTICIDE YOU USE IT. WHEN YOU HAVE THESE GIANT INFESTATIONS AND NOTHING ELSE IS WORKING? I'M AND THAT'S WHY WE ARGUE THAT IT JUST NEEDS TO BE A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT'S USED IN. LIMITED USES IS RESTRICTED AND THINGS LIKE THAT WERE TRYING TO GET ALTERNATIVES BUT IT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THE SCIENCE IS THERE AND THE MITIGATION MEASURES ARE THERE IN THE RESTRICTIONS ARE THERE BEFORE IT EVER GETS USED AND NOT JUST TAKES TIME. AND A LOT OF MONEY I JUST I WERE IN A RUSH BOTH ON A C. P. BUT ALSO ON HUMAN HEALTH HERE AND SO I I DON'T AT EIGHT IT'S TOO OPEN ENDED RIGHT NOW AND JUST THAT IT WAS A DRAFT REGULATION. I DON'T KNOW I I DON'T FIND THAT PARTICULARLY COMPELLING LIKE THIS IT THIS LAST ADMINISTRATION I TRUSTS. FUNDAMENTALLY THE NEW ONE I DON'T FUNDAMENTALLY SO LIKE IF IT'S A MATTER OF ME THERE'S A LOT OF RAIDS THAT. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT THAT JUST DIDN'T MATERIALIZE -- I DON'T NEED IT TO BE EVEN CLEAR AND CONVINCING AT THIS POINT I HAVE A VERY PRECAUTIONARY. SENSE ON THE THE HUMAN HEALTH SIDE I JUST. I DON'T WANT. TO WE CAN'T BREAK YOU GUYS AND AND WE CAN HAVE AN OUTBREAK HERE SO HOW DO WE FIND A WAY TO BRIDGE THIS PERIOD WERE BASICALLY PHASING THIS THING OUT. AND I I DON'T HEAR IT COMING FROM INDUSTRY DAY BUT LIKE IT'S AT THE END IS NEAR AS A MATTER OF WHEN FEELS LIKE. AND WOOD WE DO TODAY OR DO WE DO-IT. WHENEVER THIS NEW STUFF COMES TO MARKET SO. I I I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT INDIA'S BUT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT TRANSITION WORKS OVER IF WE MOVE THIS THING THROUGH. RIGHT LIKE HOW HOW DO WE FIND THAT BRIDGE TO SOLVE THE THE A. C. P. ISSUE IN THE NEAR TERM DO YOU THIS I MEAN YOU GUYS HAVE A GUIDE. READ ON THAT I KNOW YOU'RE INCREDULOUS ABOUT THE THIS SORT OF ALTERNATIVES BEING. I ON WORKABLE THE GOOD THE THE THINK THERE'S FUNDAMENTAL MERIT WITHOUT CHLORPYRIFOS. YES BECAUSE THE SO JUST FOR THE FIRM FROM YOUR PROTECTED SENATOR THEIR PROPONENTS I MEAN JUST. WHAT IS THIS TRANSITION LOOK LIKE? WE BàN IT WE ENDED. AND THEN SO HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS SOARED IN TERM PERIOD BECAUSE I WANT I WANT TO I'M THERE I JUST. CENTER I THINK YOUR YOUR INSTINCT IS CORRECT I MEAN THIS STUFF IT'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE DANGEROUS FOR CHILDREN IN A NEEDS TO COME OFF THE MARKET. BUT I WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE POSITION IS THAT THEY DON'T USE QUICKER OF US NOW. THERE ARE TWO ALTERNATIVES AND MORE ON THE WET HE DOESN'T USING NOW BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE AN INFESTATION OF LONG BEING SO HE DOES NEED TO GO KILL THOSE SOLD BECAUSE THERE'S NO INFESTATION BUT HE'S ALSO SAYING IF THERE IS. ONE WE NEED TO HIT HARD SO LIKE IF IF SOMETHING BREAKS OUT WHAT WE DO. YOU KNOW SENATOR I I THINK THAT THAT'S A QUESTION WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THIS. VERY CLEAR ON WHAT THIS MEANS FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH. I WOULD ALSO ADD. THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO DECADES YES. OF ITS IT DIDN'T JUST. YOU KNOW THE ISSUED ON THE DANGERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR DECADES. AND SO ARE THE QUESTION FOR ME IS HOW MUCH LONGER. DO WE PUT THESE KIDS AND BABY IS IN DANGER. AND WE SHOULD PUSH OURSELVES TO COME UP WITH THOSE ANSWERS MUCH SOONER. AND NOT LET DECADES GO BY. OF A YOU KNOW WITHOUT DOING SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT ABOUT IT AND THAT'S AND THAT'S OUR POINT TODAY. IS IS GONE TO THE POINT WHERE THE SCIENCE IS IRREFUTABLE. LET'S DO SOMETHING AND NOT KEEP. PUTTING IT OFF AND PUTTING IT OFF AND PUTTING IT OFF LIKE I'M GLAD TO HEAR THERE ARE. ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT AND LET'S PUSH ON THE ALTERNATIVE I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR LAUREN IS I MEAN ALONG THESE LINES. VIEW THIS. THIS BILL DOES IT IS NOT JUST AN HOUR RATED IT IT OUTLAWS -- THE PESTICIDE IN TILL SUCH TIME AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE P. R. ISSUES CONTROL MEASURES WHICH DETERMINE THE PRODUCTIVE TRIP CHILDREN'S NEURAL DEVELOPMENT. SO. PERHAPS IN THERE THERE'S SOME WIGGLE ROOM TO ALLOW FOR THE KIND OF STRONG RESPONSE -- IN A YOU KNOW IN A IN IN THE CASE OF A STILL IT OUT BREAK. I AS LONG AS THERE ARE MEASURES TAKEN. TO PROTECT KIDS I MEAN IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION -- EIGHT YEAH YOU KNOW WE WE BELIEVE AS WRITTEN THE AMENDMENTS REALLY ARE A BAN BECAUSE OF THAT CLEAR AND CONVINCING STANDARD IS CONFUSING IT THROWS THE REGULATORY SYSTEM JUST KIND OF ON ITS HEAD. AND BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE -- THE YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRIES WORKING WTH DPR TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT DEEP YOU'RE RIGHT NOW IS WORKING WITH CARBON A WE HAN. ON THESE INTERIM MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS BEING HARMED WE HAVE DEEP HEARING CDFA THAT IS REGULARLY TESTING FOOD TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO RESIDUE ON IT. SO ARGUMENT IS THAT A LOT OF THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA FORGET WHAT THE FEDS ARE DOING CALIFORNIA IS. PUSHING VERY HARD AND HAS RESTRICTED THE USE SO MUCH IN VERY SPECIFIC QUANTITIES. THAT WE'RE BEING INCREDIBLY PROTECTIVE OF HUMAN HEALTH UNDER THESE MITIGATION MEASURES AND RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- SO I I I DO THINK WE CAN WORK WITH THE P. ARE YOU KNOW WHAT IS A MORE THEY THEY DO HAVE PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR CERTAIN EMERGENCIES I THINK THIS BILL WOULD. STOP THAT. YES I GUESS I MEAN I GUESS MY ARM QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER IS. I HEAR THEY ARE I MEAN THE ART CITRUS INDUSTRY IS JUST FREAKED OUT ABOUT [inaudible] THE SILICON. AND HAVING SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENED TO WHAT HAPPENED. TO THE FOLKS IN FLORIDA AND YOU KNOW I GOT I'M A CITY PERSON LIKE YOU I HAVEN'T SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT I'VE DELVED INTO THE NEW UNIX ISSUE BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IMPACT ON POLLINATORS AND BEES. I AND YES SPEND SOMETIME TALKING THE FARMERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN AND JUST GOT A A SENSE OF OF THE DEPTH OF THEIR CONCERN THERE. YOU KNOW I WONDER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD IF THERE IF THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF I MEAN I I'M SURE THIS pTO BE HAPPY WITH THE BILL BUT FROM A YEAH FROM FROM SOME THE CONCERNS YOU HEARING FROM THE COMMITTEE I WONDER IF THERE BE A WAY. FOR US TO TO CREATE A ANOTHER FLEXIBILITY IN THE BILL. THAT WOULD ALLOW. FOR SOME SORT OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO BE TAKEN THAT COULD BE VERY CONTROLLED AND TARGETED AND I WHERE WHERE WE REALLY WOULD HAVE A STRONG. I SENSE OF OF CONFIDENCE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO PACK KIDS BUT SOME SORT OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE THAT COULD BE TAKEN IN THE IN THE CASE OF A MATTER OF AN OUTBREAK OF THE SELL IT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I ANY OBVIOUS HE WOULD TAKE A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN ENGAGEMENT -- I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT ANY RESTRICTION ON THIS PESTICIDE IN GENERAL ARE BUT I I WONDER WHETHER THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING INTO -- IN IN IN THE IN THE IN THE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF THERE BEING A STILL IT OUT BREAK IN -- IN IN THE IN THE CENTER VALLEY I'M OBVIOUSLY THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT RIGHT NOW YOUR TURN OTHER MORE ORANGE TREES IN PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS IN THE CITIES AND THERE ARE IN SUCH A VALLEY. SO HARD TO REGULATE AND CONTROL THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE RAN INTO IN THE ISSUE THE NEO NECKS. I THEY'RE JUST IT IS THIS COULD BE THIS COULD JUST BREAK OUR CITRUS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH YOU KNOW IS AN IMPORTANT. ARE PART OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY SO HOW DO WE SO I DON'T KNOW I I I I GUESS I WOULD ASK YOU. TO SPEND YOUR HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT I ASKYOU TO SPEND SOME TIME. TO KIND OF DELVE INTO -- THE POSSIBILITY OF A VERY TARGETED EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN THE IN THE IN THE IF THERE WERE TO BE A DEVASTATING SO IT OPERATE. WELL I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WHEN I'M GOING BACKWARDS HERE -- YEAH AND I WOULD. THE CORE THE BILL LOT OF THERE'S BEEN. A NON STOP WORKING TOWARDS. GETTING RID OF IT. AND SO I DON'T WANT TO OPEN UP A DOOR THAT SAYS WELL NOW WE CAN START USING IT AND SO. YOU KNOW EVEN FROM THE EVEN FROM THE OPPOSITION SAYING WE'RE USING THAT YES AND LESS AND LESS THAT'S A GOOD THING I DON'T WANT TO OPEN UP THE DOOR SO. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN YOU'RE RAISING I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT GOING BACKWARDS AS FAR AS THE USE OF IT. OF YOU KNOW WHERE WE HAVE GOT. TO WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT THOSE BABIES NO I I I CAN AGREE WITH YOU MORE I CAN AGREE WITH YOU MORE I WOULD ONLY BE. YOU KNOW I WOULD ONLY BE EVEN ANDERSON ENTERTAINED SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE CASE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE. I WHICH WOULD BE. YOU KNOW A POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC. I YOU KNOW INDUSTRY THREATENING STILL IT OUT BREAK THAT -- KINDLE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IN FLORIDA [inaudible] YES. HAS BEEN ON THE RISE AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE FARM WORKERS THERE'S BEEN SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM THE INDUSTRY. BUT OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD. AND REGULATORS AND HOW THEY TREAT FARMWORKERS IN THE FIELD IS THAT EVEN THROUGH EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IT TOOK DECADES TO GET THE SIMPLE. COMPONENTS OF WATER IN SHADE AND YET. MANY DIED FARMWORKERS LATER WE COULDN'T GET THAT SO I WOULD JUST CAUTION THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AS WE LOOK AT REGULATIONS AND THAT PROCESS AND WHAT THE DAMAGE. HAS BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF FARMWORKERS AND THEIR LIVES AS ARE OUT THERE. I WOULD JUST JUMP BACK INTO VERY INTO. YOUR GAUGE. WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS OPEN ENDED TO SOME DISCRETION ON THERE WITH YOU I MEAN THEY GIVE IF THERE ARE SOME WIDE OPEN DOOR NO WAY RIGHT THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK NO AND I AND I'M NOT TRYING TO SQUISH AROUND THIS ISSUE AND SORT OF GIVE SOME OPEN ENDED UP. FORTY THAT'S REALLY A BACK DOOR TO JUST CONTINUE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING THE PEOPLE ARE HURTING AND PEOPLE HAVE SERIOUS DISEASES NSWER ANY DISPUTE ABOUT THE AUTISM STUDY GOING BACK IN TIME THE STAFF IS DEAD. SERIOUS AND DEADLY SO I'M THERE JUST TO DO SOME THOUGHT BEFORE I'M I'M I'M I'LL BE SUPPORTING TODAY ABSOLUTELY. GIVE SOME WORK LET'S WORK ON THIS THOUGH AND AND AND AND ENGAGE WITH THE CITRUS FOLKS IN START FIGURING OUT LIKE. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE LOOK LIKE HOW DO WE? IF IT IS ABOUT FUNDING ACCELERATING ALTERNATIVES HOW DO WE FUND THAT HOW WE GET THINGS IN THE MARKET FASTER -- AND THEN IN THIS OUTBREAK CASE LIKE JUST WHAT'S THE PLAN LIKE LET'S JUST BE UP FRONT ABOUT IT AND THEN WE'RE GOING IN EYES WIDE OPEN EVERYONE FEELS COMFORTABLE LIKE THERE ACTUALLY IS A PLAN. BUT WE WE CAN'T GO BACKWARDS AND IT YOU KNOW THIS IS. THIS IS GOT END IT'S JUST IT'S A IT'S A TIMING A TO IT'S IT'S HIGH I I YEAH IT'S A IT'S IT'S ABOUT THIS TRANSITION AND DOING NO HARM TO PEOPLE. AND THIS INDUSTRY IN THE PROCESS THANK YOU ANYWAY I'M THERE I THANKS FOR INDULGING THE THE CONVERSATION AND LISTINGS AND POOR AND ONE AND AND IT'S ONE I THINK I JUST THINK THE SILLY ISSUES WHEN IT A LOT OF FOLKS AREN'T VERY AWARE OF WHO AREN'T. DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THE INDUSTRY -- FONG INDUSTRY A CENTER CASKEY. SYSTEM THEY GIVE US A CHAIR -- GET OUT THERE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A AS SAFE INSECTICIDE OKAY I MEAN THESE THESE CHEMICALS ARE DESIGNED TO KILL LIVING CREATURES. AND IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THEM ENOUGH AS A HUMAN BEING YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOURSELF SET. I MEAN I GOT A FRIEND OF MINE THAT -- WANTED TO KILL SOME ANTS IN HIS GARAGE BE SPRAYED FRANCE AND CLOSES GARAGE DOOR. ANY LOSSES HERE FOR FIVE YEARS YOU DID READ THE ARMOR ACTIONS LIKE I'D READ ALL THIS INSECTICIDE IN AND STILL SUFFERING FROM THE CONSEQUENCES MY DAD WAS A SPRAY PAINTER. I HAD HIS OWN BUSINESS A LOS ANGELES -- THERE WERE THE WARNINGS ABOUT LEAD BASED PAINTS WHEN HE WAS SPRING AND WASHING ITS HANDS WITH LACQUER THINNER AND UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY. FROM -- WITH THE THEY CALLED ALZHEIMER' BUT IT WAS REALLY THE ORGANIC SOLVENTS IN THE LEAD THAT. THAT POISON MY MY DAD. AND THERE CERTAINLY WASN'T THE THE THE REALIZATION WITH A FARMWORKERS DECADES AGO ABOUT THE TOXICITIES OF THE THE CHEMICALS ARE BEING USE ARMIES ARE WASN'T -- EMPHASIZED -- THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE COULD BEAT OUR STATE AND AND AND AND PETER COUNTRY -- WHAT'S WE'VE HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRY IS THAT. WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE UTILIZATION OF THIS CHEMICAL BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AND AND SENATOR STERN WANTED TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING OTHER ALTERNATIVE CHEMICALS ON THE MARKET TO REPLACE THIS THE MAY IN FACT BE SAFER. BUT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THEIR DUE DILIGENCE THAT I DON'T THINK IT GOVERNMENT THAT NEEDS TO PUSH THOSE CHEMICALS TO THE FOREFRONT. IT'S THE MARKETABILITY IN THE PROFITABILITY THOSE COMPANIES TO GET THOSE SAFER INSECTICIDES ON THE MARKET. SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE QUICK EXAMPLE ANOTHER ONE IF I MAY. WE HAD AN ISSUE IN THE TO MACULA ONE COUNTRY CALLED THE GLASSY WINGED SHARPSHOOTER. IT DOESN'T MADE A 20% OF OUR VINE I WAS COUNTY SUPERVISOR AT THE TIME. I WAS GETTING CALLS FROM DEVELOPER SAYING HEY WE LIKE TO BUY THAT THREE HUNDRED ACRE VINEYARD SIDE WE WANT TO PUT SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT LOTS AND BUILD HOMES. AND I SAID NO I SAID WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH OUR INSTITUTION YOU SEE ARE WE'RE GONNA FIND A CURE FOR THIS I'M A PUT A CIRCLE AROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES. EVER GOING TO PRESERVE THAT ONE COUNTRY. AND WE DID WE ALSO WENT TO THE STATE LOOKING FOR ASSISTANCE THE COUNTY PUT UP A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS IMMACULATE BUT A POOR TO MILLION. AND THEN WE SAW SENATOR FEINSTEIN THAT RECOGNIZE IT IF WE DON'T TACKLE THIS PROBLEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S GOING TO MIGRATE TO NAPA WE'RE GOING TO DECIMATE. A MAJOR INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WELL WE DID FIND A CURE FOR YOU SEE OUR WE PRESERVE OUR WINE COUNTRY THE GLASSY WINGED SHARPSHOOTER IS NO LONGER A MAJOR THREAT FOR NAPA AND SONOMA AND CENTRAL VALLEY -- HERE WELL IN MY DISTRICT I MEAN. SUN KISSED WAS FOUND IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHERE AN AGRICULTURAL COUNTY WE HAVE A pWE HAVEN'T HAD TOO MUCH OF THE SILLY IT. BUT IF YOU OUTLAW THIS CHEMICAL WHIH IS THE BACKSTOPS. AND THERE'S NO OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO STOP THIS POTENTIAL DEVASTATION ON OUR AGRICULTURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHY WOULD WE DO THAT. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HAVE COMING UP WITH SOME ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT ARE NECESSARY BEFORE AN AD COMMISSIONER AND A COUNTY CAN AUTHORIZE THE UTILIZATION OF THIS. BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS IN OUR ARMAMENT TARIAN UNTIL THESE OTHER. INSECTICIDES COME ON THE MARKET SO WE DON'T DECIMATED OUR AGRICULTURAL -- BUSINESS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. SO -- I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO PUT MY FARMERS IN IN HARM'S WAY OF LOSING THEIR INVESTMENTS AND BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE QUALITY CITRUS. COMING FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY -- UNTIL WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT CAN REPLACE THAT BACKSTOPS BECAUSE YOU HEARD THE WASH DON'T DO IT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE INSECTICIDE TO THAT CAN DO IT. SO WE NEED TO KEEP THAT ONE CHEMICAL I HAVEN'T HEARD OF PATHOLOGISTS COMING FORWARD AND TOXICOLOGIST COMING FORWARD AND SAYING WE HAVE CHILDREN BEING POISONED AND THE THEIR COGNITIVE -- ISSUES OR OR THERE AND IT'S CAUSING UTISM WHERE THEY WORSE WORSE DPR RESEARCH DID GET DTS pUNIQUE STATE WHERE WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT. THAT CAN EVEN PREAMP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE SAY SOMETHING A SAFE OF OUR AGENCY SAYS THAT'S NOT WHY NOT LET. DTS DO THEIR JOB WHY WE'RE PREEMPTING THEM THAT'S SETTING A BAD PRESIDENT OR WHAT WE'VE INDEED DTS FOR IF WE'RE GONNA PREEMPT THEY'RE THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS THAT. ALL THEY DO IS THEY HAVE PROFESSIONAL TOXICOLOGIST RESEARCH BIOLOGIST TO COME UP WITH THESE CONCLUSIONS TO ADVISE US. MANY OF US EARLY PEOPLE I HAVE A PIECE OF SCIENCE BACKGROUND I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. BUT I DON'T WANNA CRIPPLE THE THE THE CITRUS INDUSTRY WHAT THE WITH WITH WITH A KNEE JERK REACTION. TO A CHEMICAL THAT IS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE ANY MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT A TIME WHEN IT'S UTILIZATION IS COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR A LOT TURNS TO REPLACE. THOSE REASONS AGAINST PORTABLE. A AB DID MEAN WHAT CAN YOU RESPOND OF THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS ABOUT ABOUT EVIDENCE. OF I MEAN I EAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A THREE SERIOUS DISCONNECT BETWEEN [inaudible] AREA. THAT'S VERY FUNNY. SURE SENATOR I WOULD RESPOND IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. AS SENATOR TO RAZA MENTIONED IN HER OPENING REMARKS THERE IS A LETTER. AVAILABLE TO ALL OF YOU THIRTY NINE SCIENTISTS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS STATING UNEQUIVOCALLY. THAT OUR CORPORATE BOSSES LINK -- TO DAMAGING SHOT TO CHILDREN'S BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. THEY ALSO STATE THAT NO SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED I BELIEVE SENATOR STONE. REYES THAT LETTER TWO WEEKS AGO AT THE SENATE HEALTH CARE AND YOU ALSO HAVE OF COURSE THE ODD NUMER THE SUPPORT NUMEROUS PEDIATRICIANS AND OTHERS WOULD WIND UP TODAY. W. SUPPORT FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. SO I I THINK THERE'S AMPLE SUPPORT FROM SCIENTISTS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THIS STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY THANK FINANCES VERY CLEAR. AND THAT -- CHILDREN'S HEALTH IS THREATENED AS LONG AS CORPORATE BOSSES USE. AS THE PR I WOULD ONLY POINT OF THE DPR EVALUATION FROM LAST YEAR. FINDING THAT EXPOSURE TO ALL AGE GROUPS THROUGH FOOD. RESULT IN UNSAFE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE. EXPOSURE AT ALL AGE GROUPS AND DRINKING WATER. RESULT IN UNSAFE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE. AND EXPOSURE UP TO HALF A MILE AWAY. FROM FIELDS WHERE YOUR FAUCET SPREAD. ALSO RESULT IN UNSAFE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE. SO USEPA CALIFORNIA. SCIENTISTS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE EVIDENCE IS VERY CLEAR. OKAY CAN I TALK TO RESPOND I'LL BE QUICK. SO I WOULD ALWAYS SAY THE EVIDENCE ISN'T CLEAR AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE ME BECAUSE I'M FROM INDUSTRY I ITEM BRACE THAT. BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE THE UNDERLYING DATA THERE'S A STUDY UC BERKELEY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT I. Q.. THEY FOUND NO ASSOCIATION WITH CORPORATE BOSS SAID IN CINCINNATI FOUND NO ASSOCIATION WITH CORPORATE VICE. TWO PUBLICATIONS FROM EUROPE ALSO KNOWS THIS ISSUE WITH PER PURIFIES IN LOSS OF I. Q. SO WE HAVE FOUR STUDIES. THE SHOW NO ASSOCIATION WITH CORE PURIFIES IN LOSS OF I. Q.. I'M A GET IT I'M A MOTHER TO WE DON'T WE WE AGREE THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN I GET THAT. BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FRONT UNDERLYING SCIENTIFIC DATA. THAT HAS BEEN ROLLING OUT SINCE THE COLUMBIA STUDY WAS PUBLISHED IN THE ISN'T SUPPORTING THOSE STUDY. OKAY I MEAN I GUESS I DO TAKE COMFORT FROM THE FACT THAT THE BILL AND I UNDERSTAND IT MAY BE YEAH. BARS ARE STANDARDS THAT THAT THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THERE'S TOO HIGH BUT YOU KNOW IT REALLY. YOU KNOW IF IF. WHEN WHEN IF THE DPR FEELS COMFORTABLE ISSUING YOU THAT THAT THEY'VE GOT CONTROL MEASURES IN PLACE THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE PRODUCTIVE OF? CHILDREN'S NO DEVELOPMENT. THE YEAH THE THE USE OF THE PESTICIDE WOULD BE. AND IF WE ALLOWED -- IF AS LONG AS A DVR DETERMINES IF THERE'S ENOUGH -- PROTECTION IN PLACE I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT -- YOU PROTECTION IN THE BILL FOR INDUSTRY I I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT -- I WOULD JUST KIND OF YOU ASKED THAT WE YOU KNOW. THIS BILL ISSUES A SERIOUS ISSUE AND AND IF THERE I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IF THERE IS SOME. I I I WOULD ULTIMATELY OBVIOUSLY PUT. KIDS HEALTH OVER OVER INDUSTRY -- BUT IF THERE IS SOME WAY IN THE CASE OF AN OF A CATASTROPHIC EMERGENCY FOR THE INDUSTRY. AND ALL THE JOBS AND AND AND THE CON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SO SEATED -- THAT THAT WOULD THAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT A PATH THAT WOULD PROTECT HEALTH AND THE KIDS HEALTH. AND FARMWORKERS SELF WHILE ALSO PROTECTING THE INDUSTRY AND THAT WOULD BE A SMART THING FOR US TO DO AND SO I YOU KNOW I'M. I ACTUALLY GREW THE CENTER WE WE ARE NOT -- THIS TAKE A STEP BACK -- IN SO. I GUESS I I JUST TRY TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU IF IF IF. IF YOU WANTED TO EXPLORE THAT IDEA -- AND AND I WOULD ONLY TRIBUTARY GOT INTO THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES -- AND I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO TAKE ANY FROM COMMITMENT RIGHT NOW BUT IF THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING YOU'D BE ONE SENSE OF TIME LOOKING INTO AND EXPLORING.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND CENTERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN -- MY COMMENT BY THINKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE. TWELVE AND THIRTEEN IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS KEEPS CONSISTENT THE EXISTING THIRTY DAYTIME FRAME TO GIVE NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC OF THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROJECTS APPROVED AS A USED BY RIGHT. AND REMOVES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING WHETHER THE LAWSUIT IS BROUGHT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC INTEREST WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AG ON THIS PIECE AND SO WILL. WILL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE JUST WEREN'T ABLE TO DO IT BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING. AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA FACES A DUAL CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS. AND THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH THE RESULTING BURDENS FALLING PARTICULARLY HARD ON PEOPLE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. NEARLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE LIVING WITH AMOUNT MENTAL ILLNESS. IN MONTEREY COUNTY ARE BY INYO COUNTY PHONE HOMELESSNESS GREW IT'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN TEN YEARS WE KNOW THAT HAVING PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS LIVING AND SHELTERED RECYCLING IN AND OUT OF HOSPITALS AND INCARCERATION. IS COSTLY TO THE PUBLIC AND RESULT IN NEEDLESS SUFFERING FOR THE HOMELESS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE GOOD NEWS S THAT LAST FALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED PROPOSITION TWO THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE WHICH AUTHORIZES THE STATE TO ISSUE TWO BILLION IN BONDS. TO CREATE TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HOUSING. KEEPS PEOPLE INSIDE REDUCING ILLNESSES AND SUFFERING AND LOWERING PUBLIC COSTS. SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR HOPES TO FULFILL THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS BY CLARIFYING AND STREAMLINING THE LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND IT AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES. LIKE THOSE THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME BONDS WILL FIND. THIS BILL UTILIZES THE STREAMLINING APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECTS ENVISIONED IN LAST YEAR'S AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO AND APPLIES THIS PROCESS TO PROPOSITION TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. SUFFERING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THE BILL EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND INCLUDES THAT SUPPORT OF HOUSING MAY BE A USE BY RIGHT IN ZONES WHERE MULTI FAMILY. AND MIXED USE ARE PERMITTED CALIFORNIA VOTERS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WANT PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND ARE HOMELESS TO BE SHELTERED AND CARED. FOR NO PLACE LIKE HOME GOT MORE VOTES THAN ANY OTHER MEASURE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. SEVEN FORTY FOUR AM WITH ME TODAY IS MAY. DARRYL STEINBERG TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU SO MUCH MR MERRY PRESENT A PATIENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF LIKE AND I UNDERSTAND I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE THOROUGHNESS THAT LESS DISCUSSION I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY AND BUTTE. WITH OLD COLLEAGUES IN A DIFFERENT ROLE -- ENJOYED BY TINA THOMAS WHO -- I ONLY ALLOWED NOT TO WEAR A TIE I SO I PUT SHOULD I BE WEARING ONE WELL YOUR YOUR WITNESS SORRY REMEMBER THE PUBLIC I WONDERED ABOUT THAT. I TRY NOT TO IN MY NEW JOB IS WHICH IS WHICH IS I CAN -- THE I'M JOINED BY TINA THOMAS WHO IS -- IS THE PRIMARY DRAFTER ACTUALLY BEHIND THIS IDEA IN ONE OF THE LEAD A SEEK WERE. ATTORNEYS AND ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA AND MY FRIEND -- SO I'M ACTUALLY HERE ON BEHEST OF THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY THE INSTITUTE -- HUMBLY IN A IN MY NAME WHERE WE ARE [inaudible] WORKING WITH. VERY GOOD PEOPLE NOW TO TRY TO HELP YOU TRANSFORM THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND WE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA. OF NO PLACE LIKE HOME. ESSENTIALLY TO SAY THAT THERE MUST BE STATEWIDE APPROACHES TO USING THESE PRECIOUS MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS AND SO WE WE THOUGHT WHAT IF WE SECURITIZED. SECURITIZED A TWENTY FIVE YEARS WORTH OF SMALL INCREMENTS OF THE MONEY. AND CREATED A TWO BILLION DOLLAR HOUSING BOND HOUSE THE HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL. AND SO IT PASSED IS CENTER COPIER SAID I WANT TO THANK HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND ALL SHIP HERE. IT PASSED MORE VOTES THAN ANY OTHER INITIATIVE ON THE BALLOT WHICH A FIRM IS WHAT I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS THAT THERE IS A VERY SILENT -- BUT EVER GROWING CONSTITUENCY AROUND MAKING MENTAL HEALTH. A PRIORITY IN THIS STATE. WE WANT TO PUT THESE RESOURCES TO WORK. BECAUSE THE TRADITIONAL WAY RESPECTFULLY AND I WAS PART OF THIS PROBLEM AS WELL I THAT WE DO THESE BIG IN GREAT THINGS IN AND IT TAKES. FOREVER SEEMINGLY. FOR THE MONEY TO GET OUT. WE KNOW THIS WHEN IT COMES TO COMBATING HOMELESSNESS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ON THE STREETS FOR A LONG TIME. THE COMBINATION OF A NEW. AND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES. TOGETHER WITH APPLYING THE BEST EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN PEOPLE OFF THE STREET. TOGETHER WITH WILL AND I SAY THAT. IN A BROAD. SENSE AND NOW THEY WERE IN IMMINENT A VERY SPECIFIC SENSE COMBINED WITH WILL. WILL HELP US GET THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. HOW IS THAT WILL WE NOW HAVE THE MONEY? WE KNOW WHAT WORKS THE COMBINATION OF ASSERTIVE OUT REACH INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT TRIAGE HOUSING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE CARE AND TREATMENT. HOW DO WE SUPPLY THE WILL? THE WILL IS SUPPLIED IN PART BY CHANGING THE LAWS WHICH MAKE IT SO DARN DIFFICULT TO SITE. THESE WERE THE PROJECTS IN THE FIRST PLACE [inaudible] IT'S LEGENDARY. YESTERDAY WE APPROVE CITING A TRIAGE SHELTER. IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO I HOPE YOU WILL ALL BENEFIT FROM THAT AS PEOPLE WHO WORK IN AND AROUND THE LEGISLATURE. TWO THINGS ARE VERY CLEAR AND IT WAS STATED VERY CLEARLY. THE MORE SITES YOU TAKE OFF THE TABLE. FIRST IF YOU WERE SITES THE ROD LOCATE ANYTHING. AND SECONDLY PEOPLE MAY NOT WANTED IN THEIR BACKYARD. BUT WORSE THAN THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THE CONTINUED EXPLOSION IN GROWTH OF HOMELESSNESS IN THEIR BACKYARD IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT. TO TAKE SOME OF THE PRESIDENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY ADDRESSED TO BUY RIGHT IN THROUGH. MODEST REVISION OF OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS TO SAY WHEN IT COMES TO LOCATING SB TWO PROJECTS NO PLACE LIKE HOME. MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD. MAKE IT MORE OF A BY RIGHT. DON'T LET NO BE THEIR FIRST IN REFLEXIVE ANSWER WHICH IT TOO OFTEN IS. AND THIS BILL IN COMBINATION THOSE RESOURCES IN COMBINATION WITH APPLYING THE ELEMENTS THAT WE KNOW WILL WORK TO GET PEOPLE OF ST GIVE US A REAL CHANCE IN CALIFORNIA. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. Q. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS STAMBERG I'VE YES MA'AM -- I'LL I'LL BE HERE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS I DON'T NEED TO TESTIFY THANK YOU. SO DOES ANYONE HAVE A PARTICULAR QUESTION THE MERS GOTTA LEAVE -- SO ANYONE HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE MAYOR BEFORE. AT THIS TO AN OVER AN HOUR OKAY. OTHERWISE OTHER AND THANK YOU FOR THE BILL OKAY. THIRTY CENTER OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WE APPRECIATE IT. THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE YES YES MA'AM. DID YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS RESERVE ATTACK A QUESTIONS OKAY GOTCHA. OKAY WILL ANYONE ELSE WANT TO WEIGH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MALLORY SPOKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. JOHN KENNEDY WITH A RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY OUR FOLKS WINERIES OPPOSITION CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. YOU CAN COME UP [inaudible] YEAH. ARE YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING AT THE HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY. YOUR MEMBERS THEM HOME FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IS LIMITED TO THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW PORTION RIGHT WING. I WHY IS THIS GOING TO ADD YOU DISH. VERY GOOD QUESTION. BUT THE THE TUESDAY AND THE ALL OF THE REMAINING ISSUES IN THE BILL OR OUTSIDE OUR PURVIEW -- AND IF THE IF THE X. RIDE REVIEW WERE REMOVED WE WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD ME ON THIS TOPIC MULTIPLE TIMES. AND IS A FORMER LONG TERM -- ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY IMPORTANT THE PROJECTS THAT ARE. THE TARGET OF THIS BILL AND THAT WOULD BE ADVANTAGE BY THIS BILL HOWEVER. TAKING THIS SUPER XCELERATED JUDICIAL REVIEW APPROACH AND APPLYING IT JUST TO THIS PARTICULAR. CATEGORY OF CASE WORK TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF A VARIETY OF OTHER LITIGANTS WHO HAVE BUSINESS BEFORE THE COURTS INCLUDING -- LITIGATION INVOLVING ISSUES THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS JUST BEEN HEARING THIS MORNING FOR EXAMPLE. THE BILL BY SENATOR HUESO DEALING WITH WATER CONTAMINATION IF LAWSUIT IS BROUGHT DEALING WITH THAT INCREDIBLE PROBLEM AFFECTING. MANY YEAH COUNTLESS AT CALIFORNIANS THAT LED THE LITIGATION MOVED TO THE BACK OF THE LINE AND DOES NOT GET THE CALENDAR PREFERENCE -- WHAT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE THE BILL THAT YOU JUST HEARD BY SENATOR TO RAZA -- IF A PERSONAL INJURY ACTION IS BROUGHT. ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SEVERELY BRAIN DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF PESTICIDE CONTAMINATION. THAT CASE IS NOT GET THE ALTAR CALENDAR PREFERENCE THAT BILLS LIKE THIS PROVIDE SO WE'RE NOT HERE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING MORE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES. IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY A VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVE NO ONE CAN TAKE. ISSUE WITH THAT. BUT THE UNDERLYING JUDICIAL CONSTRUCT THAT THE THAT THAT THIS PORTION OF THE BILL IS BASED NOT THE ENTIRE BILL. BUT THAT THIS PORTION OF THE BILL IS BASED UPON IS IF IT WAS FLAWED FROM ITS INCEPTION. AND WE URGE YOU NOT TO CONTINUE TO REPLICATE AND EXPAND ITS APPROACH BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING PREMISE THAT FOUNDATION FOR THIS XCELERATED JUDICIAL REVIEW. IS THIS OPPOSE IT CERTAINTY THAT COMES WITH THIS SUPER ACCELERATED TURNAROUND TIME FOR THE TRIAL IN THE APPELLATE COURTS TO FINISH THEIR WORK. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT DOES NOT EXIST IN THE REAL WORLD. BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE PROJECTS ARE CHALLENGED THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE CHALLENGED BY. VERY DETERMINED OPPONENTS OFTEN VERY WELL RESEARCHED OPPONENTS. WHO WILL BE VERY CREATIVE IN BRINGING BOTH SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND NON&lt;/c&gt;</u> SEQUEL CAUSES OF ACTION WE'VE SEEN THAT IN SOME OF THE PROJECT TO DATE -- I'M NOT CONDONING THAT KIND OF LITIGATION BUT THE REALITY IS THOSE CASES WILL BE BROUGHT. THEY WILL HAVE SECRET AND NON SEQUEL PORTIONS AND YOU ARE TAKING JUST A PORTION OF THE LITIGATION MOVING IT TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE. AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL OTHER LITIGANTS ON THE DOCKET WITH OUT GETTING THE CERTAINTY. IT'S SUPPOSEDLY COMES FROM THIS APPROACH SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING ABSOLUTELY THE INTENTION. BEHIND THE BILL IN THE IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES WE JUST RESPECTFULLY ARE OPPOSED WE WISH THAT YOU COULD PROCEED FRANKLY WITH THE OTHER PORTIONS OF THE BILL WE UNDERSTAND THAT CLARIFYING THE USE BY RIGHT. AND THE THINGS THAT WERE DONE I KNOW SOME OF MY ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDS MAY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR APPROACH BUT OUR FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE AND CONCERN WOULD BE REMOVED IF THAT PORTION OF THE BILL. WERE TAKEN OUT AND AND SO RESPECTFULLY WE ORDER NO VOTE -- BUT ON THAT SOUL BASS. FIVE GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON US SENATORS ARE BRAND ALSO IS YOUR CALL CALIFORNIA -- THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME JUST APPRECIATED A OF WE APPRECIATE THE OTHER TAKING MMS REGARDING THE TEN DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT. AND THE TWENTY FEWER WORDS -- HOWEVER WE STUFF CONCERNS ABOUT SB -- SEVEN FORTY FOUR FIRST WE WANT TO NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH MANY MAY NOT BELIEVE THIS WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE GOAL OF FINDING A SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING CRISIS BY BUILDING SUPPORTIVE. OPEN MERGING CA AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE UNDERSTAND SYMPATHIZE WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT THE NEED TO DO SO HOWEVER WE OPPOSED TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH SEVEN FORTY FOR ANOTHER BILLS LIKE IT. GO THROUGH TO GET THIS DONE -- BY PROVIDING IN OUR VIEW IS NOT NECESSARY TO CREATE NEW SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS ARE STREAMLINED A SECRET PROCESS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL AND IT TO DO SO ONLY PROPAGATES THIS MISLEADING NARRATIVE THAT COMMUNITIES NEED. NEED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND A STRONG SEEK A NOT ONLY DOES SB SEVEN FOUR SEVEN FORTY FOUR EXAMPLES PROJECTS AND SEQUEL THE DOG ACTUALLY GOES A STEP FURTHER AND LIMITING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR THESE PROJECTS NOW I'M HAVING A A LITTLE BIT OF A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU CAN EXEMPT SOMETHING FROM SEQUEL. YET STILL LIMIT SEEK WAS IMPORTANT MECHANISMS OF PROVISIONS BUT I DO UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THAT DOING SO WOULD HAVE AN UNDOUBTED I'M DETRIMENTAL IMPACT TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES. THE BEST PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS SUBSTANTIVE SEQUEL RIGHTS THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO FOLLOW THE PROCESS THAT'S THE GROUT. AND THE JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS IS THAT SHE WAS ONLY OF COURSE MECHANISM WHEN YOU CUT THE REVIEW PERIOD SHORTAGE TWENTY SEVENTY DAYS YOUR EFFECTIVELY COULD TELLING THAT PROCESS AND TELLING. THE YEARS CONSTITUENTS THAT THE POP ON THE SUBSTANCE OF SEEK WAS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS BUILDING THESE PROJECTS. LASTLY AND MANY IN THE BUILDING AND BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT IT SOME INTEGRATION OF IF WE CAN'T IF WE CAN BUILD THESE PROJECTS AND GIVE EXTRA YOU JUST REVIEW. FOR STADIUMS WE CAN DO SO FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONE NINE AND WHILE I ADMIRE THE DESIRE TO BE CONSISTENT FIRST TAKING THE FULL ENFORCEMENT POWER SEEK WHICH NOT BE THE STARTING POINT. FOR BUILDING NEW DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLETELY REMOVING OF NEW DEVELOPMENT FROM C. QUESTION NOT BE IT SHOULD BE A NON STARTER CONSIDERING ONE THE LEGISLATURE AND STATES STRONG COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION. INTO THE NUMEROUS STREAMLINING EFFORTS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS UNDERSEA BARTY ALLIED. SO WITH THAT WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR NOBLE -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO FIND SOME SORT OF NO GROUND THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS A COMMITTEE BRINA WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE POINTS THAT - HERE CALL CALIFORNIA JUST RAISED IF I MAY SPEAK VERY QUICKLY. TWO POINTS AND I WILL MAKE A VERY BRIEF ONE IS UP THERE WAS OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME. BALLOT MEASURE I MYSELF SUPPORTED THAT -- BUT THAT MEASURE DID NOT INCLUDE THAT THERE WOULD BE A A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC OVERSIGHT AND THE REDUCTION AND ANY IMPACTS TO ERNIE UNDERMINING OF SYKORA ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE PROJECTS. AND AND THAT LEADS ME TO MY SECOND POINT WHICH IS THAT. INHERENT IN THE BILL IS THIS FAITH. THAT THE CITY COUNCIL OR THE PLANNING -- BODY THAT APPROVES THESE PROJECTS CUSTER ARE HAVE HAVE BANISTER COMES BACK AS THEY NEED TO BE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THESE PROJECTS AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT MY EXPERIENCE THAT IS NOT EXPERIENCE OF THE CENTER FOR BALLOT UNIVERSITY EVEN WHILE WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE IDEA OF BUILDING. HOUSING FOR THE FOR DRESSING THE HOMELESS ISSUE AND FOR INFILL HOUSING -- TO SAY THAT THERE TO REMOVE THE SICKER MOVES OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL THE CHANGES. THAT REDUCE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ON THESE OF THESE PROJECTS ALLOWING THOSE PROJECTS TO GO FORWARD BUT MAKING THE CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO REDUCE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M. OKAY THE MATTERS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE I'M WHAT ONE THING. THAT I'VE I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP. I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO PASS THIS. ARE WE DON'T. GAP SITUATION WHERE. A NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROJECT. IS PART OF A BIGGER PROJECT. THAT INVOLVES A LOT OF OTHER STUFF. AND THAT THAT BIGGER PROJECT. GETS THE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXPEDITED REVIEW [inaudible] I WHEN IT WHEN THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PORTION IS ONLY A SMALL PORTION BECAUSE WE ARE WE REALLY ARE I MEAN I DON'T I DON'T DISAGREED ANYTHING THE OPPOSITION TO SET IN AND I YOU KNOW I CONTINUE TO BE. I'VE WARILY APPROACHING THIS STUFF -- BUT YOU KNOW I I AM KIND ACUTELY AWARE OF THE THE THE POLICY INTERESTS AT PLAY HERE WITH REGARDS -- TO THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE AND BY THE WAY I I REALIZE RELATING TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT WAS TRIPLE REFERRED ARE YOU WANT TO GO INTO FINANCE AND HOUSING -- YOU KNOW AND AND IT I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE ENORMOUS. I'M REPORTS THAT WERE PLACING ON TRYING TO ADDRESS. I'VE THE THE ISSUES AT THE HEART OF NO PLACE LIKE HOME BUT I'M. WHEN YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU TO MAKE IT? A COMMUNITY PARTICULAR LANGUAGE NOW BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE WHICH IS VERY MEANINGFUL TO ME. ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE REALLY NARROW THIS VERY GENEROUS EXPEDITING. I TO THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROJECT THEMSELVES AS OPPOSED TO HAVING THE BIG BE PART OF A BIGGER PROJECT. EVEN YOU RAISE A REALLY GOOD POINT NEVER CONSIDERED THAT. ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME HOUSING THAT'S ALL WE INTEND AND SO IF WE NEED. TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT -- WERE MORE THAN HAPPY BECAUSE THERE'S NO INTENTION TO DO URBAN RENEWAL RIGHT -- IT'S TO BE ABLE TO I MEAN IT MAY ACTUALLY END UP. IMPROVING AND NEIGHBORHOOD BUT IT'S TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE HOUSING THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT OKAY HOUSING FOR HOMELESS WE COULD WORK ON ON A MAN'S LANGUAGE YES LANGUAGE THAT WOULD JUST WHERE THERE'S SURE THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AT A REAL I AM. VERY PROBLEMATIC LOOPHOLE IF IF WE GET THAT ADDRESS AND THAT'S OUR INTENTION OKAY SO I WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT OKAY SANDERSON. THANK YOU MISTER AND SENATOR KERREY -- I POLICE OF OR YOUR YOUR DESIRE -- TO MITIGATE THE HOMELESS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN IN THE IN CALIFORNIA AND I'VE LEARNED BEING A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT -- ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT IF YOU HAVE A PRISON IF YOU HAVE A HOMELESS SHELTER. AIRPORT -- ALL THE NEWBIES COME OUT AND MAKE IT A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION SOMETIMES FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS SO -- IN A AND I'M ONE THAT LIKE SICK WAS STREAMLINING AND I LIKE ARGUMENT. THAT WAS THAT WAS MADE BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THAT IF WE CAN EXAMPLE. FOOTBALL STADIUMS A BASKETBALL STADIUMS -- WHEN WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS WHY WOULD WE DO AN EXPEDITED AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW? BUT I ALSO. CAME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND SO I WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW I'M GONNA BE ABLE? TO EVALUATE A PROJECT. AND MITIGATE IMPACTS SO. HOWWOULD A DEVELOPER APPROACH -- COUNTY OR CITY. WITH RESPECT TO THE CITY OR THE COUNTY'S GENERAL PLAN SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE AN INFILL PROJECT IN -- IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT LET'S SAY YOU'RE ALLOWING YOU KNOW FIVE TO THE ACRE OKAY AND YOU GOT A FEW LOTS OF AVAILABLE SOMEBODY SAYS I'M GONNA BUY THAT PIECE OF INFO ON I'M GONNA. I'M GONNA GO SIX STORIES UP. WOULD YOUR BILL BASICALLY. ALLOW A SIX STORY PROJECT IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA. THAT DOESN'T THAT HAS HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS WITH THE NEW GENERAL PLAN OR WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TO ADDRESS THAT OR WHAT IF YOU'RE IN A LOCK PATTERN YOU KNOW THAT THEY COULD EITHER A LOCK. GET IN THE WAY OF HI RESTRICTIONS OR OR EVEN -- TONIGHT THE PROJECT. WHAT? IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE A SIX STORY. BUILDING LET'S SAY IT'S GOING TO HAVE -- TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY UNITS -- AND YOU'RE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET IS GOING TO BE SOME TRAFFIC IMPACTS OUR PEOPLE GOING TO GET AN EMERGENCY VEHICLES GET IN AND GET OUT. HOW HOW DOES LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIT INTO ALL OF THIS KNOWING THAT THEIR REVIEW IS GOING TO BE LIMITED? WELL LET ME LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT THAT -- THIS. ANTICIPATES THE DROP TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF THE RULES AND RESTRICTIONS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE. INCLUDING THE GENERAL PLAN INCLUDING THE GENERAL PLAN IN MANY INCLUDING ANY ANY STATE RULES SAY YOU CAN DO DENSITY BONUSES AND AND LOCAL IT IT IF IT'S INCLUSIONARY. RIVER REQUIREMENTS ALL THAT KIND OF AND YOU YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE -- TO TO VIOLATE THE THE HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE E. I. R. AND IN. THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS THEN THEN IT IT'S A BY RIGHT ARMED. AS PER THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND WHAT ABOUT A FEES AS AN EXAMPLE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WE HAVE A THE WESTERN REGIONAL COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS. THAT IMPOSES A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR FEE O EVERY HOME TO PAY FOR REGIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'RE BUILDING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WITH A BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THOSE FEES LIKE ANY OF THE DEVELOPER WOULD YES. OKAY AND THEN HOW ABOUT TRAFFIC MITIGATION WHAT WENT DOWN CONTROLS WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE -- TO REQUIRE IMPROVEMENTS IN AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT. EMERGENCY VEHICLES AND GET TO THE THE FACILITY THE FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS LIKE THE GENERAL PLAN THE HOUSING ELEMENT ALL APPLY AND ASSEMBLY. WHEN AN AGENCY ADOPTS THE GENERAL PLAN OR A SPECIFIC PLAN OR? THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT THEY ALSO INCLUDE OBJECTIVE STANDARDS THAT MUST BE MET BY A PROJECT. IN THESE WERE NOT EXEMPTING THESE PROJECTS THIS OBJECTIVE STANDARDS. OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE -- YOU BRING US FOR DO YOU. USE MY CONCERNS WITH THEIR ANSWERS AND I'M HAPPY WORKABLE. THANK YOU OKAY THIS IS ROGER I THINK YOU ON THE SENATOR STONE COVERED. HI MIKE. MY CONCERNS. HI I ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN THE LAST OF MY HADN'T HAVE SOME OF THOSE ANSWERED THAT. I HE WENT THROUGH A LAUNDRY LIST pI I STILL HAVE A CONCERN REGARDING ALL MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS WHERE THERE ARE VACANT LOTS BUT THEY'RE COVERED BY CC IN OURS. WHICH CAN BE MORE RESTRICTIVE -- THEN WHAT IS LAID OUT A GENERAL PLAN OR THE SONY HOW WOULD THOSE BE AFFECTED ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BILL ALLOWS. FOR ON SITE SERVICES THAT WOULD. SEEM TO ME FOR SOME WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THERE THERE COULD BE. YOU KNOW IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE RUNNING A ON AN ASSISTED LIVING FOR THOSE IN THAT CATEGORY. HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT? THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT DO HAVE VERY STRICT CCAR'S REGARDING -- THE USES PARKING AND ALL ABOUT. I AND THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM IN A NUMBER OF MY SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITIES I BELIEVE -- CC IN OURS WOULD STILL EXIST THEY RUN WITH THE LAND SO THEY WOULD NOT EVAPORATE BECAUSE OF THIS BILL YES OKAY. GOT THAT ON RECORD THEN I'M SUPPORTING IT [inaudible] OKAY ARE. SO THAT UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW I'M I'M I I GOT I I MEAN IT'S NOT WITHOUT SOME. SOME CONCERN THAT I AMONG SUPPORT THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW DID THE PREVIOUS BILLS THAT WE LOOKED AT THAT LOOKED AT SEA QUEST -- STREAMLINING DID PROVIDE PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ASSOCIATED YOUNG LEAD GOLD IN.

WHEN YOU GET A STARTED WITH -- SB. FORTY EIGHT INTERIM HOUSING INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENTS YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN WHEN READY. I THANK YOU ARE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE -- FOR WORKING WITH US IN WITHIN ALICE'S. I SENATE BILL FORTY EIGHT WILL CREATE A NEW I STREAMLINING PROGRAM FOR INTERIM SHELTER DEVELOPMENTS ALSO KNOWN AS NAVIGATION CENTERS. OF THE GOAL WHICH IS TO EXPEDITE APPROVAL OF A HIGH QUALITY LOW BARRIER SHELTERS TO CONNECT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SERVICES IN PERMANENT HOUSING -- ONLY NAVIGATION CENTERS THAT MEET ALL APPLICABLE HEALTH SAFETY AND BUILDING CODES -- THAT ALLOW FOR THE PRESENCE OF PARTNERS PATTERSON STORAGE OF POSSESSIONS. THE PROVIDE PRIVACY UNDER OTHERWISE LOW BARRIER AND OFFER SERVICES TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO BERMAN HOUSING. ONLY BE USED NAVIGATION CENTERS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR STREAMLINED THE GOAL HERE IS TO INCENTIVIZE. THESE ARE VERY -- I THINK IMPROVED VERSIONS OF THE TRADITIONAL HOMELESS SHELTER. THE BILL ALSO MAKES CLARIFYING CHANGES -- TO A HOUSING ELEMENT LAW REGARDING ZONING -- AND SPECIFICALLY WHERE I CITIES ARE REQUIRED TO ZONE FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS -- AS A PERMITTED BY RIGHT USE. ARE CURRENTLY US CITIES ARE REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT -- AS OWNER MORE THAN ONE'S OWN OP FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS I AND ALTHOUGH MORE MORE CITIES ARE COMPLYING -- ALL TOO OFTEN THEY WILL PLACE ADS ON IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME REMOTE INDUSTRIAL AREA -- THIS BILL REQUIRE THAT IT BE -- I NOT IN INDUSTRIAL AREA AND LET'S THAT AREA IS VERY CLOSE TO SERVICES -- WE HAVE A TERRIBLE HOMELESS ARE CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- TOO MANY PEOPLE LIVING ON OUR STREETS OF LIVING IN CARS LIVING IN -- SHELTON AND PLACES WHERE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE LIVING. AND ALTHOUGH THE OLD MICHAEL'S PERMANENT HOUSING -- NAVIGATION CENTERS AN EMERGENCY SHELTER OR CRITICAL STEP FOR PEOPLE TO EXIT THE THREE AND THE TRANSITION AND THE SERVICES AND PERMANENT HOUSING -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. pYOUR LAWLER FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ONLAW AND POVERTY. AND SHARON REPORT FROM THE CORPORATION OF FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHARMERS ANOTHER WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I'M. IT'S SO AS A SENATOR HAS MENTIONED -- IT FOR ABOUT A DECADE STATE LAW HAS PROVIDED FOR BYRATES OWNING FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS -- UNFORTUNATELY WE KNOW FROM A DECADE EXPERIENCE THAT THE SCALE OF THE LAW IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AS WE NEED IN THE PLACES THAT WE NEED THEM. THIS IS A GOOD EXPANSION ON EXISTING LAW THE BUILT ON OUR EXPERIENCE. AND WILL HELP DELIVERY NEEDED SHELTER BEDS IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THEY ARE FAR SHORT. OF IT'S A GOOD INTERMINABLE INTO AS WE TRIED TO DEVELOP MORE PERMITS SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND MORE EXTREME LOW INCOME HOUSING TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T FUND HOMELESS AS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING I WE WELL WE DO KNOW THAT PERMANENT HOUSING WORKS TO END HOMELESSNESS SHELTERS ARE AN IMPORTANT PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS SERVICES TO GET CONNECTED TO PERMANENT HOUSING -- IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THE NUMBER SALTERS IS FAILING TO MEET DEMAND AND IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO HAVE ENOUGH SHELTER BEDS -- MANY OF THOSE SHELTERS ARE SO AND SAFE AND UNINHABITABLE -- THEY HAVE VERY HIGH VACANCY RATES BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO ACCESS THE SHELTER. SB FORTY EIGHT WITH OVERCOME BARRIERS TO CREATING NEW -- SAFE SHELTERS AND AS THE SENATOR SAID IT WOULD PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR SHELTERS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF RESIDENTS. INCLUDING -- REQUIREMENTS TO ALLOW FOR LOW BARRIER SHELTERS TO ALLOW PEOPLE AND WHO NORMALLY ARE EXCLUDED FROM SHELTERS. AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND HABITABILITY CONDITIONS OF SHELTERS. I'M IN DOING SO SB FORTY EIGHT WOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO SAFETY AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS WHILE EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR A MORE PERMANENT HOUSING. THEY WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND ARCHER I THOUGHT THANK YOU. THE FOLKS WANT TO WIN IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. TWO GERMAN KEITH ON HER BEHALF CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE THE SENATORS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE WE THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THE BILL ON INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING FOLKS OFF THE STREET AND INTO SOME SHELTER SO WE APPRECIATE THE CENTERS. LEADERSHIP AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. DAVID ON BEHALF OF THE BAY AREA HOUSING ADVOCACY COALITION AND SUPPORT. FIRST FOR MARTIN WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SIMILAR RECIPE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR EUROPE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE OKAY FOLKS WORRIES OPPOSITION CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. SEEING NONE -- ITEMS FOR THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS THOUGHT CONCERNS [inaudible] TERRACE [inaudible] YEAH. LET'S REVISIT THE BY RIGHT AT STAFF REPORTS THAT SENDS. SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT BALANCING ACT WHEN YOU HAVE SOME BY MENTAL REVIEW YOU TAKING ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OUT OF DICK OF THE CONSIDERATION LEASE FOR SEVEN YEARS. I UNDERSTAND THE MEMBERS THAT YOU TOOK AND FINANCE AND AND GOVERNMENTS -- HOW WILL THE LOCAL? LEAD AGENCIES WHERE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE EMERGENCY SHELTERS. WELL WHEN I WHEN ZONING IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS HAPPENS THERE IS -- AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THAT HAPPENS -- IN CONNECTION WITH THAT I IN ADDITION -- SERVICES AND THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE -- THAT YOU YOU'RE REQUIRED. TO EVERY CITIES REQUIRED TO HAVE AN AREA -- WHERE THE -- TO WITH OUR OUR REVIEWED WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED RIGHT NOW THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DESIGNATE HIS OWN THAT IS BY RIGHT FOR EMERGENCY SHELTER. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SAYING FIRST OF ALL YOU KAMPOT THAT BY RIGHTS OWN INTO THE MIDDLE OF SOME INDUSTRIAL. DISCONNECTED WASTELAND AREA FAR FROM WHERE WE WOULD NORMALLY HAVE PEOPLE THEY HAVE -- AND THEN IF YOU HAVE. AUGUST A NAVIGATION CENTER WHICH IS SORT OF A SHELTER TWO POINT OH FOR LACK OF A BETTER. TERM -- THE DOT IS ALSO -- BY RIGHT -- SO I THIS IS NOT. THIS IS NOT INVENTING A NEW THING THIS IS -- EXPANDING AND IMPROVING ON SOMETHING THAT EXISTS ALREADY. X. IT IS ALREADY MADE OF POLICY JUDGMENT TO HAVE STREAMLINED SHELTER EXCEPT MR THROUGH THE CHAIR. IF I MANY MUNICIPALITY AND I HAVE. GONE THROUGH AN E. I. R. OR ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS AND I'VE IDENTIFIED BY RIGHT THAT'S ADJACENT TO THE INDUSTRIAL ZONE OR IN SOME PLACE THAT DOESN'T IS NOT CONTEMPLATE BY THIS BILL. THEN I WILL HAVE DONE A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL WORK TO DETERMINE IT IT DOESN'T MEAN THE LEVEL OF SERVICE PROVIDING THAT YOU DID LET'S SAY DID IT SEVEN YEARS AGO. AND THEY HAVE -- I CREATED TO SPY RIGHT NOW YOU'RE SAYING UNDER THIS BILL IT'S NOT ALLOWED YOU HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER SPOT THAT DOESN'T GIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA SAVE. YOU COULD DETERMINE THAT THE FOLKS CAN. BUILDING MY MISSING IT. AND IF THEY HAVE TO MOVE IF THEY IF IF THEY'RE IN INDUSTRIALS ON LET'S JUST SAY THAT I HAVE TO MOVE IT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS -- WHICH ARE MY MY RECOLLECTION FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AT THE HOUSE OF OUR MENTAL BECAUSE STILL ATTACHED -- TO TO THAT MAKE THAT CHANGE [inaudible] I'M. CENTER I AYE IF YOU DON'T MIND. IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE FIVE YOU'VE COME TO THE BILL. YES OKAY SO ON PAGE [inaudible] FIVE LINE. EIGHT THERE IS A REFERENCE AS A LOOK OF ROONEY DESIGNATE ZONES FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS IN AND IT THIS IS THE MAN SO WE JUST GOT THESE. AND LOOK OVER AT ME AND DESIGNATE ZONES FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS IN AN INDUSTRIAL ZONE IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE ZONE. IS CONNECTED TO AMENITIES AND SERVICES THAT SERVE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. I JUST WANTED TO GET A BETTER SENSE. OF WHAT EXACTLY MEAN BY THE WORD AMENITIES YOU MEAN IS THAT LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE AMENITIES SUCH AS ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. OR IS IT MORE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TYPE AMENITIES. I AND JUST BECAUSE OF THE THE GOAL THERE IS. RIGHT IS TO SAY WE DON'T WANNA BLANCA PER HAVE INDUSTRIAL ZONE BECAUSE HERE ARE SOME INDUSTRIAL ZONES ARE COULD BE RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE PEOPLE GET SERVICES -- AND SO IT'S NOT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID THIS SORT OF REMOTE DISCONNECTED AREAS -- AND SO THE GOAL IS TO BE CLOSE TO SERVICES -- AND TO JUST TO HELP HUMAN BEINGS -- EXIST OKAY -- I I CAN GIVE AN EXAMPLE IF THAT'S AT ALL HELPFUL. SO. YOU KNOW JUST IT IN IN OUR EXPERIENCE IN TRYING TO MOVE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALONG AND ACTUALLY DESIGNATING A BUYER ITS OWN PURSUANT. TO SB TWO FROM TEN YEARS AGO. WHICH TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE WITH THAT WELL THERE'S LIKE 92% COMPLAINTS NOW -- WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS AS A CENTERS THAT WERE DESIGNATED DESIGNATING SOME INDUSTRIAL ZONE THAT WAS WAY FAR FLUNG AND FAR AWAY FROM ANYTHING -- A GOOD EXAMPLE THOUGH OF AN INDUSTRIAL ZONE THAT ALSO MAKES SENSE THE SHOULDER LOCATION IS RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- THE AREA WHERE LIVES OFFICIALS LOCATED WHICH IS AN INDUSTRIAL ZONE NOT THAT FAR OUT OF DOWNTOWN WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT'S VERY CLOSE -- TO IT'S WELL CONNECTED WITH BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ALSO REAL AND BIKE TRANSPORTATION SO THEN GET TO AND FROM PLACES LIKE THAT IT'S THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT WE DON'T WANT. A BY RIGHT SHOULDER DESIGNATION IN A FAR FLUNG INDUSTRIALS ON WHEN NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO LOCATE FILTER IS ESSENTIALLY. EXCLUSIONARY ZONING FOR MY RIGHT SHOULDER IS IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HELPFUL AND SO I THINK THERE THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME JUDGMENT ABOUT THE AMENITIES AND SERVICES. BUT I THINK WE SORT OF KNOW IT WHEN WE SEE IT AND I THINK THAT WE CAN TRUST THAT THAT. THAT JUDGMENT CAN BE MADE QUESTION I WROTE -- ITEM NUMBER TWO SB 48% UNDER WIENER P. M. DO YOU PASS AS AMENDED THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN. ALLEN HI BATES [inaudible] HELLO [inaudible] SKINNER [inaudible] STERN. STONE I KELSEY. CASKEY AYE OKAY SO THAT'S DONE.

WERE ALL WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- SB SIXTY NINE THE OCEAN RESILIENCY OCT. TO TWENTY NINETEEN BOB REPRESENTS A MAJOR STOPPED WORD OF PROTECTING OUR OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS. AGAINST THE GREATEST THREAT THAT THEY FACE TODAY CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ACIDITY HYPOXIA MASS EXTINCTION IT CAN LEAD. TO HEALTHY OCEANS INTERN I CAN SERVE AS THE LARGEST -- ABSORBER OF CARBON EMISSIONS ON EARTH AND CAN HELP BLUNT THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SB SIXTY NINE WILL RESTORE WATER QUALITY AND ELIMINATE LOCAL OCEAN ACIDITY HOT SPOTS BY SETTING STATEWIDE A CITY ON AYE ACIDITY AND HYPOXIA OBJECTIVES. REQUIRED DENITRIFICATION OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGES AND OVERLAYING MARINE RESERVES AND AREAS OF BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE WITH STATE WATER QUALITY PROTECTED AREA DESIGNATIONS. LEGISLATION WILL ALSO HELP RESTORE HABITATS AND ENCOURAGE PRACTICES OTHER INCREASE SEQUESTRATION OF SO CALLED BLUE CARBON. INCLUDING WETLANDS RESTORATION BENEFICIAL REUSE OF MARINE SEDIMENTS TO BUILD UP A ROAD WETLANDS. AND SUSTAINABLE CULTIVATION OF SHELLFISH AND SEE WE'D. WE ALSO NEED TO PROTECT OUR ECOLOGICALLY CRITICAL SPECIES. INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE COASTAL ECONOMIES RELY ON THE BILL WILL PROTECT WHALES BY CODIFYING AN EXISTING VOLUNTARY PROGRAM AIMED AT PREVENTING SHIP STRIKES. SB SIXTY NINE ALSO TAKES A NUMBER OF LONG OVERDUE STOPS. ARE TO BEGIN REBUILDING OUR SALMON FISHERIES ARE REBUILDING OUR SALMON FISHERIES INCLUDING PROTECTION OF THE FOREST STREAMS WHERE THEY SPAWN. I KNOWLEDGE OF THIS IS A BIG AMBITIOUS -- BILL OF TERRACE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE BILLS AS HE DOES THE SOUTH -- AND THAT THERE ARE SOME GROUPS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN. ARE WE ARE WORKING WITH EACH OF THESE GROUPS -- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH -- AND THE HOPE THAT WE END UP WITH A PACKAGE TO EVERYONE I CAN GET BEHIND. I'M ALTOGETHER ARE THESE MEASURES WILL ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA HAS THE STRATEGY. AND THE ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR OCEAN. OUGHT TO SEQUESTER A LARGER AMOUNT OF CARBON. ALLOW COASTAL COMMUNITIES TO CONTINUE THEIR WAY OF LIFE INTO THE FUTURE. I WITH ME TODAY ARE TO RESA BURKE OF EDGE OF THE PACIFIC COAST SHELLFISH GROWERS ASSOCIATION. AND ALLEN LEVINE OF COAST ACTION GROUP. I AND ALSO WITH US TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MAY COME UP -- JOHN BOTHWELL THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE I RESPECTFULLY ASK BROUGH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THREE SEBERG **** ON BEHALF OF THE PACIFIC COAST OFFICE GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND IN PARTICULAR THE CALIFORNIA MEMBERS WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB SIXTY NINE WHICH WILL HELP MAKE CALIFORNIA'S OCEANS MORE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. AQUACULTURE IS NOW THE FASTEST GROWING FORM OF FOOD PRODUCTION AND WHEN IT IS DONE RESPONSIBLY IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO PRODUCE ANIMAL PROTEIN. CARBON IMPROVE WATER QUALITY ASSISTING IN CURBING ACCESS TONIGHT ACCESS NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS AS WELL AS IMPROVING WATER CLARITY. CHAU OFFICE USE CARBON FROM THE OCEAN TO MAKE THEIR CELLS AND SEE WE TAKE UP CARBON DIOXIDE JUST LIKE TERRESTRIAL PLANTS WHEN THE SEAWEED AND SHELLFISH DIE THEY WILL DECOMPOSE AND FALL TO THE OCEAN FLOOR ACTING AS A CARBON SINK. THE ABILITY FOR SELFISH TO IMPROVE WATER CLARITY HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVEN TO BE BENEFICIAL IN EFFORTS TO RESTORE EAGLE YOUR GRASS BEDS. IN MORE SEDIMENT FILLED WATERS LIKE CHESAPEAKE BAY. THREE ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIVE SEE SHELLFISH REEFS AND HELP FOREST WILL HELP BUFFER THE COASTLINE BY PROVIDING A NATURAL STRUCTURE THAT WILL HELP STABILIZE. THE SUBSTRATE AND REDUCE IMPACT OF STORM WE'VE ACTION. FOR PROMOTING THE CALIFORNIA'S SUSTAINABLE MAYOR CULTURE WE WILL BE INVESTING IN AN INDUSTRY THAT NOT ONLY PROVIDES JOBS AND INVESTMENT THE ECONOMY BUT IT ALSO DIRECTLY HELPS COMBAT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. BECAUSE WE ARE SO DEPEND ON OUR HEALTH THE OCEAN WE SEE OURSELVES AS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO ADDRESSING THIS QUICK CRITICAL CHALLENGE OF OCEAN RESILIENCY. THE PACIFIC OR SHELLFISH GROWERS ASSOCIATION IS THANKFUL TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY MY NAME'S ALAN LEVINE. I REPRESENT. COAST ACTION GROUP WHICH IS A AFFILIATE OF REVERTED COAST WATER SHED ALLIANCE. SINCE THE GROUP THAT WORKS IN MENDOCINO AND SNOW MECHANIC BECAUSE BECAUSE ACTION GROUP IS WHAT WORKS STATEWIDE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN ALLOWING ME TO ADDRESS YOU IN SUPPORTING SB. SIXTY NINE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SINCE SALMON ISSUES AND FOR THREE ISSUE SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY THREE YOU MIGHT CALL ME A PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENTALISTS THAT'S NEVER BEEN PAID FOR ANYTHING. DOZEN ADVISER TO WORKING FOREST'S PROJECTS SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND ACRES AND MENACING ON CINEMA COUNTY. I'M INTIMATELY AWARE OF THE SCIENCE AND FORCE PRACTICE RULES AND WATER CODE. THAT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. I BELIEVE SB SIXTY NINE REPRESENTS A CRITICAL AND NECESSARY STEP. FORWARD IN THE RECOVERY OF CALIFORNIA'S SALMON BEARING STREAMS. WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR SALMON BEARING WATER COURSES ARE POLLUTED. FACT EVERYONE IS LISTED AS POLLUTED UNDER THE STATE'S -- IMPAIRED WATERS LIST SECTION THREE OF THREE D.. UP OFTEN TO EXTREME LEVELS WITH THE SETTLEMENT STREAM TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS. THAT DO NOT SUPPORT SALMONIDS IN% THAT IN ALL THEIR ALL THEIR LIFE CYCLES -- THE CURRENT PRACTICE FOREST PRACTICE RULES FAIL TO PROTECT. SALMON AND THERE'S LOTS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES TO SUPPORT THE SUBSEQUENT TO THE IMPAIR LISTING OF CALIFORNIANS SALMON BEARING STREAMS SAMMY POPULATIONS HAVE DROPPED THE PERILOUS. LEVELS IN OUR STREAMS ARE IN NO BETTER SHAPE. NOW THERE'S A COPY OUT THERE THERE'S THE GARCIA RIVER WHERE WE'VE BEEN EMPLOYING THE STANDARDS AND OF SB SIX NINE AND BETTER. AND WE'VE SEEN SALMON COMING BACK FOR AWHILE AND SO YOU CAN HAVE POSITIVE BENEFITS BY EMPLOYING THESE STANDARDS. CLOSE THE **** ECONOMIES THAT RELY ON SALMON FISHERIES HAVE BEEN PUSHED TO THE BRINK. AND THE JOB LOSSES ARE CONTINUING AS WE SPEAK THIS MOVIE THE REPAIR AND RECOVERY OF THE STREAMS IS A VERY VERY VERY EXPENSIVE AND I'M REALLY DIFFICULT JOB. AND IT'S THIS RECOVERY IS CURRENTLY BEING SUBSIDIZED BY THE CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. MEANWHILE THERE'S OTHER CONNECTED SPECIES THAT SUFFER WITH THE LOSS OF SALMON -- THAT FACE EXTINCTION ORCAS NEED SALMON TO LIVE ON FAIRS NEEDS THEM IN THE LIVE ON BALD EAGLES THROUGH AND OTHER RAFTERS. TO OF WASHINGTON STATE TO SPENT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN PRESERVING THEIR MAJESTIC. THESE THIS THEIR SALMON AND CALIFORNIA MIGHT MAY SOON FIND. THEM SIMEON THE STATE IN THAT PLACE OF PUTTING MORE BACKS OUT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. SB SIX ISLAMIC SERVER TAILORED AND MINOR INFORM CHANGES TO THE URRENT LOGGING RULES WHILE ENSURING THAT WE'RE NOT UNDULY LIMITING HARVEST THE WOOD IN CALIFORNIA WHAT IS A ESSENTIAL PRODUCT AND WE NEED. TO IN FACT THESE RULES WERE PREVIOUSLY RECOMMENDED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THEN FISHING GAME BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND NO A FISHERIES IN THE TO THE THEY WERE CALLED THE TWENTY ONE TWELVE RULES AND THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. ADOPTED PART OF THEM IN THEIR NEW RULE MAKING BUT LEFT OUT PARK. TO SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ENSURES THAT ENOUGH TREES AND TREE CANOPY ARE LEFT. I'M IN THE RIGHT PERIANDER MANAGEMENT ZONES. IN NEAR STREAMS ON FOR FIRST SHADE. HANNAH OUR WATER TEMPERATURE CONTROL AND PREVENT EROSION WHICH RELATIVE TO LOGGING OPERATIONS IS IT'S THEIR PROTECTIVE ZONES THAT. INCREMENTALLY. BEING ADJUSTED IN AREAS THAT WERE IGNORED PREVIOUSLY -- THERE'S A METAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL AND THEY SOME PLAN ISSUES BUT I MIGHT LEAVE THAT TO LATER. SB SIXTY NINE ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES AND STATE NON POINT SOURCE POLICY EMPLOYING STATE NON POROUS US POLICY. WHICH IS A BALANCED PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I'M I HOPE YOU APPROVE IT HAS I THINK IS THIS IS THE FAMINES LAST CHANCE. WE NOW HEAR FROM BY THE FIRST ONE AND SUPPORT. MR TURN MEMBER SYLVIA'S ALICIA ON BEHALF OF THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION -- WE WHAT THE BALLAST WATER IT I ACTUALLY VESSEL SPEED REDUCTION OUR IS OUR ISSUE -- FOR THIS BILL ALL WE AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT IT SHOULD BE TIED. TO HARMONIZE WITH EXISTING INCENTIVES AND PRACTICES OF FOR SPEED REDUCTION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GRAHAM. WAS THERE ARE. LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. RENDON GARCIA -- HALF OF CALIFORNIA TROUT AND SUPPORT. BRENNAN DAWSON WAS VEHICLE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. I A FOLKS WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION THERE'S NO OPPOSITION -- THERE'S UP THERE. I'M JENNIFER APPEAR AT THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS ARE WHERE OPPOSE LESS AMENDED WATER CONTRACTORS THEY WATER CONTRACTORS YES TWENTY SEVEN PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT CONTRACT WITH THE STATE FOR WATER. I WERE OPPOSE LESS AMENDED BUT FOCUSING ON SECTION THREE WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL'S MEANT TO IMPROVE HATCHERY MANAGEMENT AND BENEFIT RECREATIONAL COMMERCIAL FISHERY. WE TOTALLY AGREE THE HATCHERY MANAGEMENT THE STATE NEEDS TO BE AN IMPROVED -- HOWEVER HAVE TO DO THIS CAREFULLY BECAUSE HATCHERY FISH CAN INTERFERE WITH THE RECOVERY OF NATURALLY PRODUCED FISH. AND THE BILL DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL IN ORDER TO VERIFY THAT WHAT'S GOING TO BE PROPOSAL WHAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED CAN ACTUALLY INSURE THAT WERE NOT IMPACTING NATURALLY PRODUCED FISH. WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THE BILL PROPONENTS ON THIS TOPIC. AND WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT INSTEAD REFORM SOME SORT OF WORK GROUP THAT ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON STUDY THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE HATCHERY MANAGEMENT. ACTUALLY MOVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE INTO A BETTER HATCHERY MANAGER PLAN FOR THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS THAT COST AFFILIATED WITH SECTION THREE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE -- THERE'S NO CLEAR NEXUS BETWEEN STATE WATER PROJECT AND THESE STUDIES AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT BECAUSE DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE IS UNDERGOING A MAJOR BUDGET REVIEW AND THAT THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY FUNDING THAT. THE FUNDING IS NOT THERE TO IMPLEMENT. THE SPECIFIC STUDIES THAT ARE LISTED HERE SO WE'D RATHER WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COOK COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS HATCHERY MANAGEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOUR SINGLE BECKY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE CONCERNS RELATED TO THE TIMBER HARVESTING CHANGES THAT THIS BILL WOULD PROPOSE -- WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WE'VE ASKED FOR THE STUDIES AND INFORMATION THAT THEY SAY INDICATE ARE THE NEEDS FOR THE BILL -- RECEIVE SOME OF THE INFORMATION LAST WEEK -- WE ACTUALLY -- DISAGREE WITH THEIR ASSERTION THAT THE STUDIES PROVE THEIR POINT IN FACT THE STUDIES THAT THEY GAVE US GO BACK AS FAR AS TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO -- AND THE MOST RECENT STUDY THEY GAVE WAS FROM TWENTY TEN SO SINCE THAT TIME THERE BEEN SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES IN THE FOREST PRACTICE RULES THROUGH CAL FIRE THROUGH THE BOARD OF FORESTRY IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. THAT ARE PART OF A MULTI REVIEW AGENCY. REVIEW THAT IS SEEK WORK WITH WANT AND ARE PROCESS UNDER TO REHEARSING PLANS -- WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL YOU SERVICE THAT A THOR THEIR AUTHORITY THAT WE CURRENTLY GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT PROCESS -- IN ADDITION TO THAT IN THE FOREST PRACTICE RULES THERE ARE DIFFERENT RULES BASED UPON THE REGIONS OF THE STATE IN THE DISTRICT. THAT THERE IS SO THIS BILL IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AND APPLIES THAT RULE REGARDLESS OF THE GEOGRAPHY OR THE AREA OF THE STATE THAT WE'RE IN -- FURTHERMORE WE FEEL LIKE IF THERE ARE SPECIAL RULES THAT ARE NEEDED. IN PARTICULAR PLACES OF THE STATE THE FOREST PRACTICE RULES ALSO ALLOW COUNTIES TO APPLY SPECIFIC RULES TO THEIR COUNTY IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE MULTIPLE IT -- COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE THEY DO HAVE AN IMPLEMENT THESE RULES. FINALLY WERE CONCERNED THAT BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD THEN PUT THOSE RULES IN STATUTE AS OPPOSED TO THE FOREST PRACTICE RULES THAT IT SORT OF LOCKS IN THOSE RULES GOING FORWARD. IT PLACES SCIENCE AND A FREEZE AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME WE HAVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES -- WITH REGARDS -- TO LARGE WOODY DEBRIS WHICH ONE OF THE STUDIES POINTS TO IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE. THIS LARGE WOODY DEBRIS IN WATER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SHADE PULLING FOR FISH FOOD SOURCES -- IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT WE THOUGHT THAT HAVING WOOD IN THE WATER WAS ACTUALLY A DETRIMENT AND WE PULLED IT OUT OF THE WATER NOW SCIENCE IS SAYING NO NO IT'S GOOD PUT IT BACK IN THE WATER. IN ADDITION TO THAT A LONG TIME AGO WE THOUGHT NORTHERN SPOTTED OWLS WHICH ARE ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT THEY COULD ONLY SURVIVE IN OLD GROWTH FORESTS WHAT WE'VE COME TO LEARN IS THAT SPOTTED OWLS WILL OFTENTIMES MAKE THEIR NESTS IN OLD GROWTH FORESTS. BUT THEY ACTUALLY LIKE TO BE NEAR ARE ON THE EDGE OF WHERE THEY HAVE HAD. INNINGS IN THE FOREST BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEIR FOOD SO LIKE WE HAVE A KITCHEN AND A FAN AND A BEDROOM IN OUR HOUSE. THEY ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN KITCHEN AND THEIR BEDROOM OLD GROWTH AND LIKE TO BE NEAR STANDINGS IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK. AND EITHER HAVE THESE PROVISIONS REMOVED FROM THE BILL OR POTENTIALLY PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO LANDOWNERS TO DO ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS -- TO IMPROVE LEGACY FORCED ISSUES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS ROBERT SPIEGEL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION ALSO REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION SPECIFICALLY TO PREVENT TO THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO TIMBER HARVEST AND FUNDAMENTALLY WITH WITH THIS LEGISLATION WHAT THE BILL'S DOING FITS USURPING THE CURRENT PROCESS THAT WE HAVE NOW WITH CAL FIRE ACTING AS THE LEAD AGENCY. AND THE OTHER AGENCIES INVOLVING LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OFFISH WILDLIFE THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD AND OTHERS HAVING A REVIEW PROCESS AS WELL TO GO THROUGH THAT T. H. P. TO ENSURE THAT. THE RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS OF THOSE AGENCIES ARE PROTECTED AS WELL IF WILDLIFE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS. WHAT SB SIXTY NINE DOES THE PRICE PLACES WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE? AND WHILE THAT MAY BE WELL INTENTIONED AND GOOD. THE PROBLEM IS SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO SALMON SPECIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN YOU'RE REQUIRING. SPECIFIC CANOPY LEVELS WHICH IN SECTION TWENTY ONE OF THE BILL PROVIDES. BACK CANOPY AXE WHILE NOT MAYBE NECESSARILY BAD FOR SALMON IN PARTICULAR IT DOES HAVE OTHER. NEGATIVE IMPACTS ANOTHER CANDIDATE SPECIES SUCH AS THE LIKE A FROG THAT ALSO REPRESENT A REPRESENTATIVE LIVING HAVE HABITAT AND SOME OF THESE AREAS. SO WE THE MULTI AGENCY REVIEW IS IS VERY CRITICAL TO INSURING A BALANCED APPROACH TO ALL OF THE CRITERIA SO SHOULD TO TO TIMBER HARVEST PROGRAMMER PLAN. AS WELL AS ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AS PART OF IT AGAIN FOCUSING ON ONE ISSUE A REGIONAL WATER QUALITY MIGHT BE FINDING GOOD FOR ONE SPECIFIC SECTION ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE. BUT IT DOESN'T RESOLVE THE OTHER ISSUES INVOLVING THE MULTI AGENCY JURISDICTION OF THIS OR CONCERN OBVIOUSLY LIKE I SAID. WE ARE ON DOING THAT PROCESS WERE GIVEN ONE AUTHORITY ESSENTIALLY. THE POWER TO VETO THE TIMBER HARVEST PLAN WE BELIEVE THAT'S UNNECESSARY GIVEN THE FORCE PRACTICE ROLE FOR PRACTICE ACT. AND THE UPDATES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LAST LITERALLY FIVE TO TEN YEARS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN. CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU IN OPPOSITION OKAY WE'RE OKAY I WOULD LIKE TO JUST REMIND THE FOLKS TESTIFYING THAT THE TIMBER HARVEST ISSUES IS REALLY A NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER. ISSUE WORK ENVIRONMENT QUALITY AND THIS BILL WAS -- I GUESS IS DOUBLE REFERRED. IS THAT RIGHT SO I MEAN I'M I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THOSE COMMENTS BUT THOSE COMMENTS WERE MOST APPROPRIATELY -- DIRECTED TOWARD NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. SURE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND CHAIRS A BRIAN WHY DON'T HAVE THE CALCULATIONS FORCES SO SHE ASIAN WE ARE THE STATE'S REGISTER PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS SO WE ARE ACTUALLY. LICENSED BY THE STATE THAT YOU APPROVED AND ROBBERS PLANS SO WE HAD TO PUT OUR LICENSE ON THE LINE WE ACTUALLY DO THESE TIMBER HARVEST PLANTS AND WE MUST RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSE A SENATORS BILL WE'VE WORKED WITH HIM ON HE PASS ON VARIOUS BILLS BUT WE WERE GONNA BE MUST POSE THE FORTY PROVISIONS. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YES YOU'RE RIGHT THIS THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE DID DO WHAT THE TIMBER HARVEST PLAN FOR PROVISIONS BUT THIS BILL BLENDS THE ISSUE BETWEEN WATER QUALITY. IN THE APPROVAL TIMBER HARVEST PLANS AND SO THE FACT THAT. BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY APPROVE THESE PLANS WE WORK WITH ALL THE OTHER AGENCIES BEFORE THEY CAN BE SIGNED OFF. THE NARRATIVE IN THIS BILL ON THE PREMISES AT BOTH APPROVAL PLANS HAVE NOT BEEN DONE CORRECTLY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WHICH IS JUST NOT THE CASE. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MULTI AGENCY AGREEMENTS WITH THE WATER BOARD PART OFFICIAL WILDLIFE THE TRYING IMPROVE THE SETTLEMENT ISSUES BUT THIS BILL TAKES THE PREMISE A LEAST A FORTY PROVISIONS TAKES A PREMISE THAT. NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS THEIR LEGACY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH FORTY PROJECTS CORRECT. BUT THOSE AREN'T CAN'T JUST BE ASSOCIATE IT WOULD JUST TODAY'S FORTY PRACTICES WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY. RUSSIA PROFESSIONAL FORSTER THEY TAKE THEIR JOB SERIOUSLY WE THINK THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY TARGETS ONE PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AS PREVIOUS COMPANIES THAT THE FORTY PROVISIONS TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL AND BE MORE OF A CONSTRUCTIVE AND AND INCENTIVIZE BILL RATHER JUST A A MANDATE SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WEARABLES AND BECAME. YES MY NAME'S LAURA CAMP -- I'M REPRESENTING FOR FLANNER CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A NON AND NON INDUSTRIAL OWNER SO THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE SAWMILLS THERE ARE OWNERSHIP REYES FROM TEN ACRES TO AS MUCH AS A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES BUT ON THE THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE HERE BEFORE -- I WOULD JUST REITERATE THAT THAT -- THERE IS A MULTI AGENCY PROCESS -- THE RULES AND REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED -- SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND PARTICULAR THE OF PROTECTION OF AN OUT FROM ITS SOLEMN SOMEONE IS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND ROADS-- THAT DEAL WITH EROSION WATER QUALITY AND IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN AND I I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT WE WE DID I HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS -- THEY WERE PROVIDED BY BY A THE SENATOR STAFF AND ONE OF THEM GOES BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY NINE DEALING WITH SAY SOMEONE IS. NEARLY ALL THE CONSTITUENCY GROUPS INTERVIEWS SUPPORT INCENTIVES TO LANDOWNERS TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN SOMEONE OR HAMMER. THE PROGRAM OF ITS CITIES MUST BE DEVELOPED. TO ALLOW THE VALUE PERMANENTLY DESIGNATED STANDING IN DOWN TREES TO BE DEDUCTED FROM THE TIMBER OWNERS YOUR OTHER STATE TAXES. WHILE THIS WAS AUTHORED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE FIVE NONE OF THOSE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE. ALL WHAT WE HAVE. HAVING INSTEAD OF THAT IS. A SUBSTANTIAL -- REDUCTIONS IN THE VALE ABILITY OF TIMBER AND TIMBERLAND -- THROUGH THE ASP RULES AND SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS TO ARE THE FINANCIAL INCREASES IN COST. ASSOCIATED WITH ROAD RULES GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE MAGNITUDE. ARM. THERE'S TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OF STREAMS -- THEY'RE COVERED UNDER THE EXISTING RULES THAT IS. A ONE MILE WIDE STRIP. FROM HERE TO LOS ANGELES. ON A HALF MILE WIDE ON EITHER SIDE OF INTERSTATE. FIVE THAT'S HOW MUCH ACREAGE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT WOULD PROBABLY DOUBLE OR PERHAPS TRIPLE. IF YOUR PROPOSALS IN THIS BILL ARE PUT FORWARD SO THANK YOU. I THANK YOU I MAKE I GET THIS IS A BIG BILL WE WE HAVE TO SO PLEASE DO LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO THINK YOU COULD SAY DID A OR I YOU KNOW. SO SEE YOURSELF WITH PREVIOUS COMMENTS BUT I'M. YEAH PLEASE MAKE NEW COMMENTS AND AND KEEP THEM AS FAR AS YOU CAN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR AND MEMBERS CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE HAVE A POSITION OF OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS -- I'D SAY FOR PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE OUR CONCERNS CENTER ON THE DENITRIFICATION PROTOCOLS WHEN. YOU NOTIFICATION PROTOCOLS IN THE BILL AND I WOULD JUST CONCURRENT WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES IN THE ANALYSIS THANK GRANT THANK YOU. GEN MEMBERS BY DYLAN REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES ALL THE MAJOR WASTE WATER AGENCIES OUR CONCERN. IS WITH SECTION TWENTY TWO AND WE WOULD REQUEST THE REMOVAL OF THAT THEY'RE ALREADY STUDIES UP IN THE BAY AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OTHER SCIENTIFIC STUDIES MANAGEMENT PLANS -- FOR NUTRIENTS INCLUDING A NEW A NEW TRAFFIC CATION AND DENITRIFICATION. AND SO WE THINK WITH THOSE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY WITH THE REGIONAL QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS -- THAT THIS PROVISION IS UNNECESSARY THANK YOU. DURING GREEN -- CAL AN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICTS AND I WOULD ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH PRIOR COMMENTS -- IN ADDITION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE LESS AMENDED POSITION THERE WAS ONE OTHER SMALL AMENDMENT WE ARE SEEKING TO SECTION NINETEEN IT HAS TO DO WITH -- STATE WATER QUALITY PROTECTION AREAS AND THERE ARE ALREADY EXISTING PROCESS PROVISIONS -- LAYING OUT THE PROCESS AND DETAILED CRITERIA IN THE CALIFORNIA OCEAN PLANNED SO WE BELIEVE THAT'S ON NECESSARY TO INCLUDE IN THE BILL THANK YOU. MARGOT. OF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION -- WOULD CONCUR WITH AMENDMENTS UPS ARE WITH THE COMMENTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY MADE -- ON SECTIONS NINETEEN TWENTY TWO OF THE BELL -- ADDITIONALLY WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BALLAST WATER PROVISIONS THEIR AMENDMENTS TAKEN FROM THE LAST COMMITTEE WHICH I THINK ARE AN IMPROVEMENT. BUT I THINK AS A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT -- THERE'S FEDERAL PREEMPTION IS LOOMING -- IN THE MEANTIME I THINK TO TAKE AWAY I'M ANY CONSULTING AUTHORITY FROM STATE LANDS AND MOVE IT OVER TO THE WATER BOARD. AT THIS POINT IS UNNECESSARY STATE LANCE'S BEEN. HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROGRAM -- FOR YEARS SO IT'S SEEMS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING -- AN OUT OF ORDER AT THIS POINT I'M AND THEN OUR FINAL COMMENT IS WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF REMOVING THE AUTHORITIES OUT OF THE REGIONAL WATER UALITY BOARDS TO THE STATE BOARD. FOR DISCHARGE -- INTO SENSITIVE AREAS AND PUTTING THAT THE STATE FORTY THINK IS. PERHAPS AONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH ON THE CANADIAN ALICE'S DOES POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE. AND THERE MAY BE SOME LAG TIME OR SOME OVERLAP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EXEMPTIONS THAT THE BILL OUTLINES OR ALLOWS FOR ON THE CREATION OF THOSE AND SO THERE THERE'S AN ISSUE IN. WHO IS? IN CHARGE OF THOSE EXCEPTIONS -- DURING THAT TIME PERIOD SO WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION BUT WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH AUTHORS STAFF AND AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL IN THIS AREA AND THINK THAT PERHAPS THIS. COULD BE NARROWED A LITTLE BIT MORE -- TO ENSURE THAT IT IS LIMITED TO PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES -- ARMORS ARE NOT PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT ARE HOLDERS THAT AND PDS PERMITS AND SO WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND REFINED THAT ISSUE -- BUT FOR NOW WE ARE PASSED THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. NUMBER TEN FOR THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL BUT I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE BALLAST WATER PROVISIONS. AND MENTION THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS ON SOME UNRESOLVED ISSUES WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. EXPERT REVIEW PANEL AND WHETHER IT'S REDUNDANT AND CAN BE SUSTAINED FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. THAT'S WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY ON THOSE PROVISIONS -- FOR CALLING. SO THE BILL. WHY ARE WE FIND? THE COMPETITION PLAN IN CALIFORNIA CLOSE BASS INDUSTRIES PLAINTIFF DOCKED INCORPORATOR TO IMPROVE DENITRIFICATION PROTOCOLS [inaudible] I'M. IS IT YOUR WE SURELY. THERE OUGHT TO BE DENITRIFICATION PROTOCOLS. THAT THEY EMPLOYMENT MAYBE YOU OBJECT TO THE LEVEL OF OF FIVE SPECIFICITY THAT OR OR ARE YOU CALLED A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. APPROACH FURTHER DOWN IN YOUR LETTER BUT I'M I'M JUST FILLING IN TODAY MISTER CHAIR BUT MY UNDERSTAND OUR MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT THIS THE BLANKET REQUIREMENT WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY -- WERE ALREADY INVOLVED IN IN THE BAY AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- WITH THE REGIONAL BOARDS ON ON THAT TOTAL NUTRIENTS STUDIES WHICH INCLUDES A DENITRIFICATION YEAH. I GUESS. IF I CAN DO A FOLLOW UP. WE HAVE A LOT OF LEGACY IN -- NITRIFICATION THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW IS ARE WE DISPUTING THE CLEAN UP OF THE CURRENT LEGACY OR ASSISTED THIS NEW DISCHARGED THAT MAY BE CREATED BY ACTIVITY WITH DISTRICTS. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT IS THAT THERE WOULD BE NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR TREATMENT AT WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES TO REMOVE NITROGEN COMPOUNDS. RIGHT NOW MOST TREATMENT PLANTS -- DISCHARGING TO THE OCEAN AND I'M I WOULD ASSUME THE BAY I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE -- DON'T NIGER FINDING I DEFY THEIR AFFLUENT IT -- TO ENERGY INTENSIVE EXPENSIVE PROCESS TO ADD DIRECTOR FRED INTO THE TREATMENT -- FACILITIES OFTEN YOU END UP DE RATING YOUR CAPACITY OF YOUR TREATMENT PLANT BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA TANKS THAT IT TAKES -- SO IT BECOMES A VERY EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE ARE MODELS AND STUDIES THAT ARE GOING ON BOTH IN THE BAY AREA. AND WITH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL WATERS RESEARCH PROJECT THOSE ARE STILL UNDER WAY AND HAVE -- A WAYS TO GO SEVERAL YEARS AGO I BELIEVE -- WE JUST FEEL THAT THIS IS SORT OF NOT THE RED PROPIONATE -- DECIDE TO SORT OF END RUN AROUND THE SCIENCE THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW TO DETERMINE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. MR JUST INSTANTLY HAPPENS TO BE THE I THINK THE WASTE TREATMENT PLANTS IN OR LIMON IN. IN SAN LEANDRO MY DISTRICT IS IS DOING THE WASTE WATER TREATMENT AND THEY RE READING OF THE BAY -- WITH SOME FANTASTIC. RESULTS AS FAR AS THE THE SUCCESS. YEAH I'M WE HAVE SET WE HAVE A NUMBER OF TREATMENT PLANTS THAT DO NOT TO FIND THE NINETY FIVE THOSE ARE OUR WATER RECLAMATION PLANS ARE OCEAN DISCHARGE PLANT DOES NOT IT'S A BIG UNDERTAKING I DON'T HAVE A A COST ESTIMATE AT THIS TIME OF HOW MUCH IT WOULD. COST OUR STAFF OR ARE LOOKING INTO IT BUT IT BECAUSE W ARE INVOLVED IN THIS IN THE MODELING AND STUDIES GOING ON WE ARE LOOKING AT IT BUT IT'S IT'S IT JUST SEEMS PREMATURE TO US AT THIS POINT IN TIME. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT I'M. SENATOR SOME YEARS BEFORE. YES OKAY A FEW THINGS ON YOUR I'M I APOLOGIZE JOHN BOTHWELL AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE KEEPER LANCE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE PANEL -- COUPLED POINTS ON ADDRESS FIRST THAT WE'RE WE'RE GETTING AHEAD OF THE SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING THE RESEARCH AND THE MODELING. I'M I'M ACTUALLY ON THE ADVISORY GROUP THAT'S BEEN WATCHING THAT MOLLY IN SCIENCE GO FORWARD IS ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO COME OUT WITH PRELIMINARY -- CONCLUSIONS IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE LIKE A SOME OF THE STUDY BUT THEY ANTICIPATE -- NEXT MONTH TO BE RELEASING INFORMATION ABOUT IT -- WE HAVE SHARED THIS BILL WITH THEM ALONG THE WAY THEY HAVE NOT SHARED ANY CONCERNS WITH US MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS -- WE'VE TALKED WITH OCEAN PROTECT WHO. THE THE THE RESEARCH AND SCIENCE SPOKES ARE WORKING WITH WORK ON THE MODELING -- OF ON THE MODELING YEAH THE WORKING WITH YOU [inaudible] SCORE. WORKS QUIRK SEC SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL RESEARCH PROJECT IS WHAT'S THAT THERE'S A FEW GUYS YEAH IT'S A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY WITH THE COMMISSION THE COMMISSION CURRENTLY CHAIRED BY THE ASSISTANT JENNA MANTRA MY AGENCY BUT IT INCLUDES ALL OF THE REGIONAL BOARDS THE STATE WATER BOARD USEPA AND THE SANITATION. FOLKS AND YES AND FOR LARGE SANITATION AGENCIES ARE. THREE SHARED IT WITH SCHOOL WORK. MOVE THOSE GUYS AND HEN AND THEN WHAT AND WE HAVEN'T -- Và. IF THE JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT OF OF WASTE WATER FOLKS AND BUT THERE'S A IF THIS. OKAY OKAY OKAY -- RIGHT DO YOU ONE SECOND OKAY ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT WILL -- CLOSE THE IT'S IT'S A SCIENCE WORKING GROUP THAT THAT STUDIES VARIOUS THINGS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BIGHT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THE MODELING PAY THROUGH FOR WAS WHAT WHAT EFFECT YOU WHAT. AM I SENATOR SO WHAT'S HAPPENING pTHE ROLE WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO CLOSE ON IT WILL JUST FINISH THE CONVERSATION. ENTERTAIN A MOTION AND OKAY THANK YOU SO WILL WILL FINISH THE CONVERSATION THESE GUYS GO BACK TO ENERGY. SO WE'VE SPOKEN WITH THEM WE SPOKE WITH OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL WHICH HAS BEEN FUNDING THIS THIS STUDY IN MODEL OF PC HAS BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION LOOKING AT OCEAN ACIDIFICATION HOTSPOTS -- ALONG WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD WHO'S BEEN MONITORING THIS AND ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THIS AND THE THIS -- A HOT SPOT TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH OR WITHOUT THIS BILL OF THE STATE BOARD IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION OF SETTING A WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE. THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE AWAY HOT SPOTS AND THEY DO WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THE SCIENCES THERE WHICH THEY THINK IS GOING TO BE. THE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS ALREADY COMING OUT THERE ALREADY IN TALKS -- AND WE ARE TALKING WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD TO PROVIDE AMENDMENTS AND FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THE STATE BOARD DOESN'T GET AHEAD OF THE SITE THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IN THE STATE BOARDS ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO THIS EITHER. OF GET AHEAD OF ITSELF AND SET SOME WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE THAT'S NOT SCIENTIFICALLY AND LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE. I WORK AT THE STATE WATER BOARD CONSTANTLY. I'VE NEVER SEEN A WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE BE ADOPTED. ANY SHORT OF FIVE YEARS THEY FIVE TOXICITIES BEEN FIFTEEN YEARS THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THE SIDE STILL BE SIDE PANELS. TO INFORM WHAT THIS WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE IS. THIS ONLY JUST SETS THE TRIGGER TO GET THE STATE WATER BOARD TO MOVE FOR WITH THAT AND AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE LANGUAGE OR WORK WITH STATE BOARD. ON TO TO PUT LANGUAGE IN THERE SO THAT THEY DON'T GET AHEAD OF THE SITES THAT. IT MAYBE THE STATE FOR NEED TO PUT A FINDING IN OF OKAY THE THE SCIENCE DOES JUSTIFY THESE HOT SPOTS ARE CURRENT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. OKAY. BUT OKAY I ONE MORE THING ON THE JUST THE DEAN EDUCATION PIECE. THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS REALLY FOR THE WASTEWATER FACILITIES TO MEET THE WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE THAT THE STATE BOARD SETS WE DON'T WANNA BE PRESCRIPTIVE AND SAY IT HAS TO BE THIS ONE WAY. OR THE WAY I READ THE LANGUAGE IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIVE THE ONE EXACT WAY -- WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THE BAY AREA FOLKS I'M AS A P. C. S. FBI. ON THERE DOING OTHER THINGS OTHER THAN JUST PURE DEAN EDUCATION LOOK AT WETLANDS LOOKING RECYCLED WATER WE WE THINK THE BILL HAS THE FLEXIBILITY IN THERE NOW. WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE A FURTHER LANGUAGE THAT THAT ADDRESSES THAT. WE'VE BEEN TINKERING WITH AN AMENDMENT TO TO REQUIRE THE STATE BOARD TO CONSIDER REGIONAL BOARD APPROACHES WHEN THEY'RE DOING THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. WHEN WHEN THE SEA PORTS THAT'S A WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE THAT WILL SET THE OBJECTIVE BUT THERE'S AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT GOES WITH THAT AND THAT'S REALLY THE HEART OF IT AND THE MEAT OF IT? AND THE WATER BOARD'S GOING TO HAVE THE DISCRETION TO LOOK AT OTHER REGIONS AND WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON INCOMPETENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT WORKS TO MEET THAT WATER. AT THE END. OKAY WELL ARMED. INTERESTING I HAVE I THINK THERE'S A TON MORE WORK TO BE DONE -- I THINK EVERY RECOGNIZE THAT WOULD RELATE TO THIS BILL -- BUT I CERTAINLY AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRIDE INTENDED THE BILL AND I'M INCLINED TO GIVE THE THE AUTUMN YOU KNOW MORE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BUT IT'S A POOR LUCKY IN THE IT ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATIONS. WHICH IS ALL DIFFERENT YEAH ALL DIFFERENT DEAL IT'S NOT NATURAL RESOURCES WERE REALLY FOCUSING ON THE WATER QUALITY IN AND THAT THAT CHUNK OF IT -- SO WITHOUT. TIPPING MY HAT ON APPROPRIATIONS QUESTION THEN THE HOLISTIC JUST DOING MY JOB HERE IS A MEMBER OF THE E. Q. I WILL MOVE THE BILL. CURRENT SIZE A MOVE WE HEARD A CLOSING FROM THE AUTHOR. MUCH MORE WORK TO BE SPENT ON THIS. ENORMOUS BILL I'M SORRY TO PLEASE CALL. ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB SIXTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE BATES [inaudible] HILL [inaudible] SKINNER. STERN STONE. I CASKEY.

SEE YOU BEING HERE AND AND YOU MAY PROCEED BY WITH PRESENTING SB. TWO TWO SIX WHEN WHEN WHEN READY. AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD COMMANDERS [inaudible] CATACLYSMIC FIRES. NOT JUST LAST YEAR ALTHOUGH THAT WAS PROBABLY AT A PEAK YEAR. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THESE FIRES. I HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OUR WATERSHEDS. IN TERMS OF THE CAPACITY OF THOSE WATERSHEDS TO RETAIN. THE STORE WATER. IN THE WATERSHEDS. IN TERMS OF EROSION. THAT SOMETIMES AND FILLS OUR STREAMS AND RIVERS [inaudible] SEDIMENTATION [inaudible] STILL [inaudible] AND SNAGS [inaudible] THAT HAS. REALLY AFFECTED THIS. AND IT AFFECTS ALL OF OUR WATERWAYS. SOMETIMES THESE FIRES REACH SUCH A TEMPERATURE THAT THE ROUND IS LITERALLY STERILIZED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. BEFORE ANYTHING COMES BACK. IT TAKES A SUSTAINED EFFORT. TO BRING THEM BACK. DIVIDE THE HABITAT [inaudible] THE RECREATION. AND EVEN THE ECONOMIC ABILITY. THESE WEAKEN TREES. OFTENTIMES GET INFECTED WITH VARIOUS INSECTS. AND DIE. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. WITH THIS MEASURE. IS TO CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM. FOR OUR COMMUNITIES TO BE PROVIDED SOME PHONETIC FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. TO BEGAN. TO RESTORE. THIS WATERSHED REGION'S. IN THAT SO MUCH OF THE WATER TRANSFERS AROUND CALIFORNIA NORTH SOUTHEAST WEST. IT'S AN CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. THAT WE MAINTAIN THESE LANDS. AND RESTORE THEM [inaudible] THIS PROVIDES. SOME FUNDS IN. FOR THAT PURPOSE IT'S THE REALLY NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB. BUT IT IS A START. IT IS THE FIRST COMMITMENT. AND NOT BE OUR GOAL. WE ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS.

SO WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND AND AND YOU MAY PROCEED THIS IS ITEM TWELVE IS SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ALAN OF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AND THINKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL IS MUCH APPRECIATED. MEMBERS SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR ON DESIGNATED AND ALL. THOR TATUM HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL THIS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM. EASY TO SAY -- SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR ONE POWER CONSUMERS TO MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH PRODUCTS TO USE WITH THEIR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES. TO NOTE THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN ANY PRODUCT INGREDIENTS OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PRODUCT LABELING. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR ALSO PROTECTS THE CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION INCLUDING PRODUCT INGREDIENTS FORMULAS THAT IS NOT IDENTIFIED AS HARMFUL BY AUTHORITATIVE BODIES. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS IN CLEANING PRODUCTS THAN THOSE THAT WE USED TO CLEAN AND PERFORM PERFUME OUR OWN BODIES. PUT ANOTHER WAY WE NORMAL MORE ABOUT THE FLOOR CLEANER AND DISINFECTANTS THEN WHAT IS IN OUR SHAMPOOS DEODORANTS AND BODY SPRAYS. WE ALSO KNOW VERY LITTLE LITTLE ABOUT THE FLAVORS IN CHAP STICKS MOUTHWASH AND LIP GLOSSES AND I LEFT MY LITTLE LIP GLOSS AS AN EXAMPLE IN EDUCATION I WAS GOING TO BRING THAT AS A LITTLE A LITTLE THING LOOK AT MANY MARKETED TO CHILDREN. WITH KRISPY KREME DONUT AND ICE CREAM FLAVORS ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO SECRET HAZARDOUS. FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR CHEMICALS AND RELATED HARMFUL CHRONIC HEALTH CONCERNS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS CHILDREN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND PEGNANT WOMEN. CURRENTLY NO STATE OR FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANT FLAVOR INGREDIENTS TO CONSUMERS OR REGULATORY AGENCIES. THIS LOPHOLE ALLOWS CHEMICALS TO HIDE UNDER THE WORD FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR ON THE LABELS OF BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WITH A LITTLE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. OF THE SAFETY OF THOSE INGREDIENTS. YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF ON THE LABELS OF THE PRODUCTS THAT YOU USE EVERY MORNING AND EVERY NIGHT. THOUSANDS OF SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS ARE USED TO CREATE THE FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS THAT COMPRISE THE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WE USE EVERY DAY. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE PERFUMES SHAMPOOS MOISTURIZERS LIPSTICK AND HAIR STYLING PRODUCTS SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS. RANGING FROM ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO REPRODUCTIVE HARM AN INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER. FRAGRANCE CHEMICALS CAN BE FOUND IN MORE THAN 95%. OF SHAMPOOS CONDITIONERS HAIR STYLING PRODUCTS ANTIPERSPIRANT AND SHAVING PRODUCTS AS WELL AS FINE FRAGRANCES. BODY SPRAYS AND LOTIONS I THINK YOU'RE GETTING THE HINT HERE THAT IT IS IN EVERYTHING. IN FACT ONE THIRD OF THE FRAGRANCE CHEMICALS CURRENTLY IN USE HAVE BEEN LINKED TO NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS. IT IS CURRENTLY LEGAL FOR COMPANIES TO NOT DISCLOSE THESE INGREDIENTS HOWEVER. IN RESPONSE TO GROWING CONSUMER DEMAND SOME COMPANIES HAVE BEGUN DISCLOSING FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS IN THEIR PRODUCTS AND BIG RETAILERS ARE BEGINNING TO DEMAND INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE AS A CONDITION TO SELLING PRODUCTS IN THEIR STORES. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WILL BE THE CATALYST NEEDED TO ENSURE THE CONSUMERS KNOW THE PRESENCE OF HARMFUL INGREDIENTS AND ALL OF THE PERSONAL CARE OPTIONS. ALL PRODUCTS THAT THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF BUYING. WITH THIS BILL WE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT CONSUMERS AND WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT INGREDIENTS ARE IN THEIR BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT THE USE DAILY. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONCE AGAIN A NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEADER ON PUBLIC HEALTH. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR REPRESENTS THE STRONGEST DISCLOSURE LAW IN THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD OF HARMFUL FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS. BEFORE TURNING OVER TURNING OVER TO MY SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT I WOULD LIKE TO DRESS ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENTS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. OPPOSITION KNOWS THE SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR IS TRYING TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST HOWEVER THEY RELY ON THEIR OWN INTERNAL INDUSTRY FUNDED STUDIES AND PANELS. TO COME TO THIS CONCLUSION. IF THE PRODUCT INGREDIENTS ARE INDEED AMONGST THE SAFEST THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM DISCLOSING THE PRESENCE OF ANY THAT APPEAR ON THE AUTHORITATIVE CANDIDATE CHEMICAL LIST. OPPOSITION NOTES THAT SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR THREATENS TRADE SECRETS. GET THE BILL STRENGTHENED BY THE MEMBERS BEING TAKEN TODAY. DOES NOT REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF INGREDIENTS WAIT AMOUNT COMBINATION OR MANNER IN WHICH THE INGREDIENTS ARE USED. THE OPPOSITION NOTES THAT THE MEASURE RELIES ON TWENTY SEVEN AIR QUOTE. AUTHORITATIVE LISTS THAT ARE NOT GROUNDED IN SOUND SCIENCE HOWEVER THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY ONLY CONTAINS TRULY AUTHORITATIVE DTS SEE CANADA CHEMICAL LISTS. THAT ARE IDENTICAL TO THOSE INCLUDED IN THE CLEANING PRODUCTS BILL. FINALLY OPPOSITION NOTES THAT SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR UNFAIRLY PUNISHES AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS LED ON DISCLOSURE YET WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THE FRAGRANCES AND CLEANING PRODUCTS THEN WE DO THAT WE WHAT WE USE TO CLEAN OUR OWN BODIES. I DO NOT BELIEVE DISCLOSURE IS A PUNISHMENT MEMBERS I AM COMMITTED TO ONGOING GOOD FAITH DISCUSSIONSWITH INDUSTRY AND ADVOCATES. I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO THIS POINT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IS JANET NEWMAN WITH BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS AND MARTIN WOLF THE DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABILITY AND AUTHENTICITY AT SEVENTH GENERATION. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WILL ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. GIVE ME PROCEED. OKAY YOU GO [inaudible] IRATE TRAFFIC. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR ALLEN AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JANET NOODLE MAN AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM AND POLICY A BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS A PROUD SPONSOR OF SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR I AM HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IT IS A IN NYC CREDIBLY IMPORTANT CONSUMER IN RIGHT TO KNOW ISSUE THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED. A SENATOR LEYVA MENTIONED FRAGRANCE CHEMICALS CAN BE FOUND IN THE MAJORITY OF HAIR CARE PRODUCTS PERSONAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS FINE FRAGRANCES BODY SPRAY LOTIONS. AS WELL AS MORE AND MORE MAKE UP LITERALLY ANY OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS YOU USE DAILY THAT SMELL GOOD. AND FLAVOR CHEMICALS CAN BE FOUND IN THE MAJORITY OF TOOTHPASTES MOUTHWASHES LIP GLOSSES AND CHAPS DECKS. YET NO FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THESE INGREDIENTS TO CONSUMERS TO MANUFACTURERS OR EVEN TO THE FDA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES. THIS LABELING LOOPHOLE ALLOWS DOZEN SOMETIMES EVEN HUNDREDS OF CHEMICALS MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CANCER. BIRTH DEFECTS ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION ANOTHER HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS TO HIDE UNDER THE WORDFRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR ON PRODUCT LABELS WITH NO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. BY ANY STATE NATIONAL OR GLOBAL ENTITY REGARDING THE SAFETY OF THESE INGREDIENTS. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WOULD CLOSE THIS LABELING LOOPHOLE BY GIVING CONSUMERS AND WORKERS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR CUSTOMERS FROM UNSAFE CHEMICAL EXPOSURES AND SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR ENJOYS BROAD BASED SUPPORT FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN ORGANIZATIONS. EIGHTY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND HEALTH ASSOCIATIONS AND THIRTY FIVE COSMETIC COMPANIES. DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING POPULAR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL HOWEVER OPPONENTS ARE ATTEMPTING TO PAINT THIS COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL. AS AN UNWARRANTED. UNWANTED OVER REACH AN OVER REGULATION OF A VERY SAFE CORNER OF THE MARKET. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR THREATENS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION. AND I KNOW SENATO LEYVA I'M JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT BUT THIS IS REALLY THE CORNERSTONE OF OF WHAT THE BILL'S ALL ABOUT. IN FACT SB SEVEN FIVE SEVENTY FOUR DOESN'T THREATEN THE COMPETITIVE EDGE OF A COMPANY'S FRAGRANCE FORMULATION OR FORCE THEM TO GIVE AWAY THEIR SECRET SAUCE. THE BILL ONLY REQUIRES A SMALL FRACTION OF THE THOUSANDS OF FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR CHEMICALS CURRENTLY BEING USED TO BE PUBLICLY. TO DISCLOSED LITERALLY LESS THAN CHEMICALS IN USE TODAY. AND ONLY THOSE FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR CHEMICALS THAT APPEAR ON A DESIGNATED LIST. FURTHERMORE THE BILL SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THE WEIGHT OR AMOUNT OF ANY INGREDIENT EVEN FOR REPORTABLE INGREDIENTS. WITH THIS LIMITED INFORMATION IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A COMPETITOR TO REPLICATE THE FRAGRANCE OR A FLAVOR FORMULATION. THE MARKETPLACE HAS RESPONDED TO THE INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR MORE INGREDIENT TRANSPARENCY WITH STRICTER LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD FOR CLEANING PRODUCTS AND FOR COSMETICS. NOW MANY HUNDREDS OF COSMETIC COMPANIES ARE VOLUNTARILY FULLY DISCLOSING FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS RETAILERS TO ARE BECOMING PART OF THE SOLUTION. IN FACT TARGET WILL BE REQUIRING THE NATIONAL BRANDS THAT THEY CARRY TO DISCLOSE THEIR FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS BY. TWENTY TWENTY EVERYONE IS AT RISK FROM HARMFUL CHEMICAL CONCERNS AND SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS FROM SECRET FLAVOR AND FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS. ON BEHALF OF SB FIVE SEVENTY FOURS BILL SPONSORS BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS AND WOMEN'S VOICES FOR THE EARTH. WE URGE YOU TO GIVE CONSUMERS AND WORKERS THE INFORMATION THEY WANT THEY NEED AND THEY DESERVE BY SUPPORTING SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU BY THE WAY I'M JUST BEFORE YOU MOVE ON TO THE YOU MISSION PERSONAL HYGIENE -- I I SENT I SENT THE WELL MY WIFE AND SHE'S EXCITED ABOUT WHICH I GUESS IS BAD NEWS FOR THE OPPOSITION. BUT THAT BUT SHE DID ASK ABOUT -- TAMPONS ARE THEY COVERED UNDER THE AND WHY NOT. THERE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY REGULATED AS MEDICAL DEVICES F. FROM IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT THEIR AND THEY'RE UNDER A DIFFERENT AREA OF REGULATION BY THAT BY THE FDA. SO THEY'RE NOT CAPTURED WITHIN WITHIN THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY WERE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING COSMETIC PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDES PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS BUT NOT TAMPONS WHICH IS KIND OF COUNTER INTUITIVE OKAY WOULD YOU I MEAN YOU SAID THAT THE WORK ON THAT FOR THEIR CENTER [inaudible] ALL THE YEAH [inaudible] IT IS. THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER. YEAH. OKAY ALL RIGHT. FOR YOU TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THAT THE ME BUT MY WIFE WILL BE VERY HAPPY. THAT'S THE KEY AND TO OKAY ALL RIGHT GOOD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH YES SIR. FIRST SENATOR ALLEN PLEASES FREE WIFE THAT SEVENTH GENERATION WHICH IS A MANUFACTURER WE NINETEEN PROBABLY BY YOUR DIAPERS ADVOCATING FOR SUCH DISCLOSURE THANK YOU. CENTER ALLEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARTIN WOLF ON THE DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABILITY AND AUTHENTICITY FOR SEVENTH GENERATION. AND ON BEHALF OF SEVENTH GENERATION UNILEVER AND MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS COUNCIL. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR BECAUSE MEDIC FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENT. RIGHT TO KNOW ACT. TWENTY NINETEEN SEVENTH GENERATION IS THE NATION'S LEADING BRAND OF HOUSEHOLD AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO HELP PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH. AND THE ENVIRONMENT. OUR COMPANY DISTRIBUTES PRODUCTS FROM NATURAL FOOD RETAILERS SUPERMARKETS MASS MERCHANTS AND ONLINE RETAILERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND IN MORE THAN TWENTY COUNTRIES. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTH GENERATION WAS ACQUIRED BY UNILEVER. A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS DEDICATED TO MAKING SUSTAINABLE LIVING COMMON PLACE. UNILEVER ONE OF THE LARGEST BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COMPANIES IN THE WORLD EMPLOYEES OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. AND HAS SALES IN EXCESS OF SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS. UNILEVER IS A MEMBER OF THE PERSONAL ON UP. EXCUSE ME PC PC THE PERSONAL CARE OF PRODUCTS COUNCIL. AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THOUGH AT THIS TIME PC PC DOES NOT I AM. TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF SEVENTH GENERATION. UNILEVER AND MEMBERS OF A S. BC ALL OF WHOM HAVE A STRONG PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING MANUFACTURING WAREHOUSING DISTRIBUTION HEAD QUARTER AND OTHER OFFICE FACILITIES. IN PRESENTING THIS TESTMONY. I COME BEFORE YOU AS A SENIOR EMPLOYEE OF THE SUCCESSFUL SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS THAT IS GROWING AT DOUBLE DIGIT RATES THEN INDUSTRY WHOSE SALES ARE ESSENTIALLY FLAT. I COME BEFORE YOU AS A CHEMIST WHICH SCIENCE I HAVE STUDIED AND PRACTICED MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE. AND I COME BEFORE YOU AS A FATHER WHO VALUES THE HEALTH OF HIS CHILDREN. AND BELIEVES WE DO NOT HAVE TO SACRIFICE THE HEALTH OF OUR FAMILIES TO MAINTAIN OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY. NOR DO WE HAVE TO SACRIFICE OUR ECONOMIC ABOUT VITALITY TO MEAN THE WHOLE MAINTAIN THE HEALTH OF OUR FAMILIES. IF WE ACT WISELY WE CAN HAVE BOTH. AS STIPULATED IN SECTION ONE OF THIS BILL. THERE ARE ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS OF USED TODAY. THESE INGREDIENTS INCLUDE CARCINOGENS REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS AS MAGICIANS NEUROTOXINS ALLERGENS AND OTHER CHEMICALS OF CONCERN. DESPITE THIS THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO STATE OR FEDERAL FEDERALLY MANDATED FRAGRANCE INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE. REQUIREMENTS FOR BEAUTY OR PERSONAL GOAL PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. THIS LACK OF FRAGRANCE INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE CREATES AN UNFAIR BURDEN FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS WANTING TO AVOID EXPOSURE. TO CHEMICALS THAT THEY DEEM UNSAFE. IN CORRECTING THIS PROBLEM THIS BILL WOULD NOT PLACE AN UNDUE BURDEN ON INDUSTRY. BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE COMPANIES IN CLEANING PRODUCT COMPANIES HAVE MUCH IN COMMON WHEN IT COMES TO FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS. THE CHEMICALS USED TO FRAGRANCE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COME FROM THE SAME LIST OF FOUR THOUSAND CHEMICALS TYPICALLY USED TO FRAGRANCE CLEANING PRODUCTS. CORRECT CORRECT CASSIE JUST WRAP IT UP [inaudible] CERTAINLY. SORRY SIR. THAT IS QUITE ALRIGHT. SEVENTH GENERATION HAS BEEN DISCLOSING ALL INGREDIENTS pIN ITS PRODUCTS.

I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT THE NEED FOR THIS BILL ARISES OUT OF THE ATONISHING REALITY THAT THIS L'INDUSTRIE IS LARGELY SELF REGULATED. THAT THE FDA DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO EITHER. REQUIRE RECALLS OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC OR TO REQUIRE SAFETY TESTING OF THESE PRODUCTS AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE CONSUMER OF NEEDED CONSUMER PROTECTIONS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHER MEMBERS MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL WERE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING. HUNDREDS OF BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE COMPANIES MANY OF THEM LOCATED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SOME IN YOUR DISTRICT MISTER CHAIR -- I WANNA FIRST OFF START OFF BY SAYING. THAT WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WITH THE SPONSORS AND WE APPRECIATE THE FORM IN WHICH THE BILL IS IN RIGHT NOW AND I ALL THAT SAID I THINK WE HAVE. TO WE HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS ON THE BILL AND ALL SPEND A PART OF MY TESTIMONY TALKING ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS. BUT AT THE HEART OF OUR OPPOSITION IS REALLY THIS ISSUE OVER AND THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OUR PRODUCTS -- NAMELY WITH RESPECT TO THE FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF YOU WALK DOWN AN AISLE OF A STORE AND YOU LOOK AT A CONSUMER TESTING OUT A PRODUCT BEFORE HE OR SHE IS BUYING T. YOU'LL USUALLY SEE THAT PERSON TAKING THE PRODUCT PUTTING IN HIS -- HAND SMELLING IT. FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR PRODUCTS. AND SO -- REALLY BALANCING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE PRESERVATION OF TRADE SECRET WITH RESPECT TO THESE PRODUCTS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US. IF YOU THINK ABOUT COCA COLA AND JUST AS AN EXAMPLE AND TE MANNER IN WHICH THEY BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THEIR SECRET RECIPE SECRET -- FOR THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS CONSIDER IF THAT RECIPE WAS MADE PUBLIC AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COUNTERFEIT IF IT WERE MADE PUBLIC -- THAT IS PRECISELY THE CONCERN HERE AND I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC POLICY QUESTION THAT WE NEED A WAY HERE. IS BALANCING A CONSUMERS RIGHT TO KNOW WITH BALANCING A COMPANIES RIGHT TO PRESERVE ITS TRADE SECRET TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS. I'M WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CLEANING PRODUCTS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT WHICH WAS PASSED LAST YEAR BY THIS BODY AND IT'S BEEN REFERENCE MANY TIMES WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL -- IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CLEANING PRODUCTS ARE DIFFERENT THAN BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE DIFFERENT THAN FIND FRAGRANCES. AND SO I THINK THAT THOUGHT OF KNOWLEDGE MINT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL AND THINK THROUGH THAT FRAME. I WITH ALL THAT SAID OUR INDUSTRY IS VERY PROGRESSIVE WITH RESPECT TO DISCLOSURE WE'VE BEEN DISCLOSING OUR INGREDIENTS IN OUR PRODUCTS SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES -- AND I THINK THERE IS A PATH TO THIS BILL AND I THINK I FEEL LIKE WE'RE CLOSE -- WITH ALL THAT SAID I DO WANT TO RUN THROUGH VERY QUICKLY ARE REMAINING CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE OVER THE COUNTER COSMETICS EXEMPTED FROM THE BILL IN PART BECAUSE AS IT KNOWLEDGE BY THE SUPPORTERS IT IS REGULATED BY THE FDA. VERY RIGOROUSLY REGULATED BY THE FDA SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- TC'S TAKEN OUT FROM THE BILL -- AND BECAUSE THIS BILL REQUIRES DISCLOSURE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATABASE AND BECAUSE THERE ARE TWENTY SOME ODD LISTS DESIGNATED LISTS THAT WOULD PROMPT DISCLOSURE UNDER THE BILL WE WOULD LIKE FOR DPH. TO REGULARLY UPDATE THOSE LESS ON THE DECK DPH WEBSITE WHICH I THINK IS AN AGREEABLE THING BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR COMPANIES ESPECIALLY THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THOSE LESS AS INGREDIENTS ARE UPDATED AS A REMOVED OR ADDED X. ADDRESS -- UNIFORMITY IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT SO PART OF OUR **** PREEMPION. IF WE ARE SABOTAGING STATEWIDE POLICY WE WOULD LIKE FOR THIS TO BE THE STATEWIDE POLICY. AND ALONG THOSE LINES WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE ALIGNMENT WITH EXISTING DEFINITIONS THAT ARE READY AN EXISTING LAW. THERE IS A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF INGREDIENT A DIFFERENT DEFINITION FOR COSMETIC PROFESSIONAL COSMETIC AND TRADE SECRET THAN IS ALREADY FOUND IN EXISTING LAW. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE ALIGNED WITH EXISTING DEFINITIONS [inaudible] I'M. CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION PROTECTION IS STILL REMAINING CONCERN OF OURS. WE APPRECIATE WHAT IS IN THE LANGUAGE HOWEVER DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH UNDER THEIR EXISTING AUTHORITY HAS THE INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY TO **** FOR FULL FORMULATION. AND WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY LIKE TO HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS AROUND THAT TO SAY THAT IF WE DO REVEAL OUR FULL FORMULATION THAT. THAT INFORMATION IS -- WILL BE MADE OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND FINALLY -- WE WOULD REALLY LIKE -- MORE OF A QUESTION THAT WE LKE TO POSE A COMMITTEE SINCE THIS IS A CONSUMERS RIGHT TO KNOW BILL -- WITH THIS BILL DOES REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE THESE INGREDIENTS ON TO IT DPH WEBSITE. AND ONE THAT WE BELIEVE IS NOT OFTEN USED BY CONSUMERS AND IF THE GOAL REALLY IS TO DISCLOSE TO CONSUMERS SIMILAR TO THE CLEANING PRODUCTS RIGHT TO KNOW CT BILL WHICH YOU GUYS PASSED LAST YEAR -- THAT BILL REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF INGREDIENT INFORMATION ON TO THE MANUFACTURER'S WEBSITE AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS THE MOST LOGICAL PLACE FOR INGREDIENT THE SOLDIER TO TAKE PLACE WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU. WE GIVE OUT OKAY MOSQUE ABOUT THAT. THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW COOKING UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION WHERE THE PRINCIPAL TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE FRAGRANCE INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE HAVE AN OPPOSE LOS AMENDED POSITION ON SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR OUR MEMBERS CREATE MANUFACTURE FRAGRANCES INCENSE FOR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS HOME CARE PRODUCTS -- WE ALSO REPRESENT FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS SUPPLIERS AND FINISHED PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS OF FRAGRANCE CONTAINING PRODUCTS. THE INDUSTRY IS FIRST AND FOREMOST COMMITTED TO THE SAETY OF OUR PRODUCT THE END WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE A FRAGRANCE MATERIALS IN. NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND THE ORGANIZATION CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE FRAGRANCE PALETTE OF INGREDIENTS AND PLACES RESTRICTIONS ON INGREDIENTS AND HAS EVEN BANNED INGREDIENTS WHEN SCIENCE SUPPORTED THE NEED TO DO SO EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF FORMAL GOVERNMENT'S REQUIRING US. WE ALSO TAKING GREETING COMMUNICATION OF THE MATERIALS WE USE VERY SERIOUSLY WE ARE RESPONDING TO THE INCREASED DESIRE OF CONSUMERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IN THE PRODUCTS THEY USE EVERY DAY. IN OUR MEMBERS STRIVE TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO ARE THE CAUSE MEDIC MANUFACTURERS TO DELIVER THAT INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS WHILE ALSO PRESERVING THE UNIQUENESS. OF THESE PROPRIETARY BLENDS WHICH IS THE ARTISTRY OUR MEMBERS HAVE BUILT THEIR BUSINESSES AROUND. WE HOPE WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT BOUNCE IN SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR IN ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS MENTIONED BY THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNSEL I JUST WANNA QUICKLY ODD. ARE MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT WERE SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS PARTICULARLY AROUND THE LEADING -- THE FRAGRANCE ALLERGEN LESS FROM THE DESIGNATED LESS WE BELIEVE -- THIS MAKES IT VERY CLEAR TO THE REGULATED COMMUNITY HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON THOSE ALLERGENS. ALSO IN REGARDS TO TIME LINES AND DPH MAINTAINING THE LIST OF LISTS IF YOU WELL -- AS WAS MENTIONED IN MANDY'S COMMENTS WE AGAIN APPRECIATE THE REFERENCE IN THE ANALYSIS -- SUGGESTION THAT THE AUTHORS AND SPONSORS CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT -- AND LASTLY I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT LANGUAGES IN THE BILL WE HAVE PROVIDED SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS -- TO MAKE SURE THE LANGUAGE ACCURATELY REFLECTS FRAGRANCE MATERIALS AND THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED TO THESE INGREDIENTS FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE UNAWARE OF FRAGRANCE ALLERGENS THAT COULD BE LIFE THREATENING AS THAT LANGUAGE SUGGEST. AND I KNOW OFTEN THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION CAN TAKE A BACKSEAT TO THE ACTUAL STATUTE BUT THESE DECLARATIONS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THEY SHOULD BE ACCURATE. THE WERE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ON HOW BEST TO COMMUNICATE FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M OKAY YES FOLKS WANNA WIN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR EMBERS TRANSMIT ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WICCANS WHICH CONSISTS OF THE MANUFACTURERS OF OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS AND MEDICINES. AND WERE CONCERNED THAT THE DEFINITION OF COSMETIC PRODUCTS MAIN CAMPUS -- EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY -- SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY MANUFACTURED [inaudible] OKAY. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ON CAP CAME ACU CAP CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO AND OPPOSE UNLESS I'M IN A POSITION LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ADAM REGULAR BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT. I SO THAT IS FOR THE COMMITTEE SO I'M. MAYBE ARE FOR HIM [inaudible] WELL. MACOMBER ONE A ADVOCATES UP AND THEN WE CAN HAVE KIND OF BACKING FOR THAT ARE WHO IS THE LEAD I'M. OKAY. ALRIGHT SO I'VE THROUGH THE PROPONENTS CAN YOU. I MEAN I HEARD A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND THE LIST OF LESS THERE IS A WEBSITE. I'M CAN YOU CAN I MEAN SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S GOOD MOVEMENT ON THE CONVERSATION BUT CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF YOUR RESPONSE TO THE THE THEIR ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION I MEAN YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE THIS. WORK YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO I WOULD FIRST SAY THAT WE HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS IN EACH COMMITTEE IT'S BEEN HEARD FROM SO AS THE OPPOSITION BRINGS UP -- THEIR CONCERNS WEHAVE TRIED TO AMEND THE BILL TO RELIEVE THEIR AND THEIR CONCERNS ARE THEIR OPPOSITION. AT SOME POINT IF YOU TAKE TOO MANY AMENDMENTS THE BILL ISN'T WORTH DOING A TWO THINGS SPECIFICALLY THAT I WOULD LIKE -- TO TO ADDRESS ARE ACTUALLY ONE TO KNOW -- TO WE ARE NOT REQUIRING THE RECIPE TO BE MADE PUBLIC AND ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE JUST TOOK IN YOUR COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR. IS THE CHANGES TO TRADE SECRET DEFINITION TO MAKE SURE THAT STATE WILL NOT RELEASE FULL PRODUCT FORMULATION INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. PROTECTING THE QUOTE UNQUOTE CHANEL RECIPE OR ANY OTHER RECIPE. SECONDLY WITH BIG WITHOUT REGARD TO THE FDA. JUST BECAUSE IT'S FDA APPROVED DOES NOT MEAN WE KNOW WHAT IS IN THE FLAVOR OR THE THE PERFUME. FTA DOES NOT NOTE NOR DOES ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITY REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF THE FRAGRANCE FOR FLAVOR INGREDIENTS EVEN IN APPROVED PRODUCTS SO JUST BECAUSE IT'S FDA APPROVED DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY ARE GOING AFTER WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL. SO I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY AND WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT AGAIN AT SOME POINT YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO HOLD ON TO SOMETHING ARE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A BILL. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A NEW ONE YEAH THERE'S THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS. I'D LOVE I'D LOVE TO ADDRESS -- ONE IS AROUND THE EXEMPTION OF OF OTC PRODUCTS -- WHAT THAT REFERS TO OUR COSMETIC PRODUCTS THAT MAKE A MEDICAL CLAIM WE THINK OF THEM AS BECAUSE MASUDA COLES AND THEY ARE REGULATED DIFFERENTLY BY THE FDA -- AND THEY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ANTI PERSPIRANT SUNSCREENS -- TOOTHPASTES WITH -- THAT FIGHT GINGIVITIS I MEAN ANYTHING ANYTHING THAT MAKES A MEDICAL CLAIM. IS REGULATED DIFFERENTLY BY THE FDA BUT BUT TWO THINGS ONE THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT REGULATION IT'S ABOUT DISCLOSURE. SO THAT PART IS IRRELEVANT AND THE OTHER PART IS THAT THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM IN CONSUMERS DON'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN KOSMOS ARTICLES AND COSMETICS CURRENTLY. BECAUSE MISTER NICHOLS ARE BEING REPORTED TO THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM IF THEY CONTAIN A PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICAL. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF BECAUSE MISTER NICHOLS CURRENTLY IN THE SAFE COSMETICS DATABASE AND CONSUMERS. IF THEY'RE USING AN ANTI PERSPIRANT OR DEODORANT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT ONE IS AN OTC REGULATED PRODUCT AND THE OTHER IS SO. THAT TO ME FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A RED HERRING. I'M. SHOULD I GO ON QUESTION -- LET'S LET'S THANK YOU THANK YOU I I I I I YEAH THIRTY BULLETS HERE FROM MINE FROM SUMMER HOUSE HE I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANY ODD QUESTION SITE. OKAY -- WELL IT'S TEMPTING TO GET INTO A TRADE SECRET DISCUSSION WE'RE NOT INTO THE ISSUE WE ARE AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY SO I'M GOING TO CONTROL MYSELF -- YOU CAN TRY SEVEN JUDICIARY IS WELL I JUST WHAT I'M THERE I'M THERE. OKAY ALL RIGHT -- LOOK I I I I APPRECIATE THE FACT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER AND I MEAN I UNDERSTAND YOU YOU WANT -- TO YOU KNOW I WILL SAY ON THINGS LIKE. BUT HE'S UP ON A WEBSITE THEY MAY NOT BE USED BY FOLKS MAYBE THERE'S A BETTER WAY I DON'T KNOW. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT I'M. LOOKING FOR DID SEEM TO WORK OUT BUT I DO THINK ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS VITALLY IMPORTANT AND I'M. AS YOU SAY TO DISCLOSURE BILL ALLOWS CONSUMERS OR THE MORE INFORMATION AS TO WHAT. FACTOR BUT NOT THEIR FACES IN OUR BODIES AND IN THEIR BODIES ITS ADDRESS SO -- I UNDERSTAND THIS IS BILLS GOT A LONG WAY TO GO AND JUST A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE -- BUT I'M CERTAINLY -- ONE SUPPORTED TODAY TO TO TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FOR TO MOVE THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE -- FOR ITSELF WITHOUT ENTERTAIN A MOTION OKAY SO IT'S REMOVED IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A AS YOU RIGHTLY SAID IT IS A DISCLOSURE BILL IT IS NOT A LABELING BILL WERE NODDING AND WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANY LABELING TO HAPPEN WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE. TO BAN ANY OF THE PRODUCTS THEY USE YOU KNOW AS A SOCIETY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET BETTER. AND AS WE MOVE ALONG AND WE REALIZE THAT THERE COULD BE THINGS OUT THERE THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN OUR ON OUR BODIES THE COULD BE CART CAUSING US HARM. PEOPLE JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT YEAH I WANT TO KNOW THAT WHEN THE OPPOSITION ASKED ME WHY DID THE BILL I SAID YOU KNOW I SAID. PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE WHEN I WAS ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE DAY AFTER I WAS ELECTED WE FOUND OUT MY FIFTY YEAR OLD HUSBAND. WHO'S IN GREAT HEALTH GREAT SHAPE RARELY EXERCISES HAD KIDNEY CANCER NO CLUE WHERE THAT COULD HAVE COME FROM WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING HE USES GAVE HIM THAT. BUT MORE MORE PEOPLE HAVE CANCER MORE MORE PEOPLE HAVE ALLERGIES PEOPLE JUST HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PUTTING IN AND ON THEIR BODIES. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OKAY. ALL RIGHT TO THE ITEM IS BàN -- MOVED BY CINEMA CASKEY -- SECTOR PLEASE KALRA. ITEM NUMBER TWELVE SB FIVE SEVEN FOUR BY SENATOR LEYVA THE MISSION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE BATES HILL [inaudible] SKINNER [inaudible] STERN.

WE'D LIKE YOU STERN YEAH. YES CENTER STERN ONCE YOU. KAMALA DíAS IN. WILL HAVE YOU START WITH THE SB. SIX THIRTEEN THIS ITEM THIRTEEN AND YOUR I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY I WAS SERVICE ITEM. TEN IS SB FOUR SIXTY THREE NATURAL GAS STORAGE WELLS MONITORING AND REPORTING ALL RIGHT. ON WE GO. SORRY FOR THE DELAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THIS IS A PRETTY STRAIGHT FOR TRANSPARENCY MEASURE. THE THE RULES THAT APPLY. TO THE FRACKING INDUSTRY WHICH WE SET OUT A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN WE REALIZED WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT CHEMICALS. THE INDUSTRY WAS USING TO EXTRACT IN -- YEAH -- USE OUR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES -- DO NOT CURRENTLY APPLY TO NATURAL GAS STORAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM FOR US AFTER THE ONLY SO CANYON DISASTER. WHERE WE HAD? BUT TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE GET PUSHED OUT OF THEIR HOMES FOR THE LARGEST GHASTLY CAN US HISTORY AND A LOT OF THEM GOT SICK AND ARE STILL SICK AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHY [inaudible] AND WE HAVE FOUND OUT IN RECENT MONTHS THAT. WELL THE WHOLE THERE WAS STILL OIL IN THAT FORMATION. AS WELL AS HEAVY METALS AND OTHER CARCINOGENIC MATERIALS THAT AT THE TIME THE GAS COMPANY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE WERE. PUSHED INTO THE AIR AND WE FOUND OUT THROUGH SOUTH COAST RECORDS. FROM EARLIER DISCLOSURE THAT LONG HOLD PEOPLE WORK GETTING SICK BECAUSE THERE'S BARIUM IN PEOPLE'S COUCHES OR THEY WERE DEALING WITH BENZENE BECAUSE THERE WAS OIL IN THERE WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PUTTING IN. THAT STORAGE FACILITY OTHER STORAGE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THIS BILL MOVED. WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT LAST YEAR WITH A PORT FOR BECAUSE OF PROCEDURAL ISSUES OR JUST WILL BRING IT BACK THIS YEAR AND THIS IS THE VERY LEAST. IN MY VIEW THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ON NATURAL GAS STORAGE IN THE STATE I THINK THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT MORE CONCERNED. ABOUT HOW CLOSE THEY ARE TO COMMUNITIES BUT I'VE I FIGURED WE SHOULD AT LEAST STARTWITH THIS BASIC STEP OF A RIGHT TO KNOW -- I KNOW YOU GUYS BEEN TALKING ABOUT TRANSPARENCY OTHER CONTEXT BUT HERE I THINK IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. SO WITH THAT RESPECT AS RIVAL A BILL ELLIOT IS HERE -- WITH ENVIRONMENT WORKING. THIS BILL ELIA ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. I'M WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING INTO THESE NATURAL GAS STORAGE AREAS AND WHAT COULD COME OUT THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WAS. THE LEAST SO CANYON THING WAS A DRASTIC RESULTS FOR THE NEIGHBORS AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'SIN THEIR THEIR NATURAL GAS STORAGE OCCURS IN. LARGE BASINS SCATTERED AROUND THE STATE THERE WAS ONE PROPOSED FOR SOUTH SACRAMENTO UNDER RESIDENTIAL AREA THAT WAS. NOT APPROVED EVENTUALLY IN A MATTER WHERE THEY ARE EITHER EXISTING LONG TERM HISTORICAL THEIR SUMMER VERY OLD NOW. OR WHETHER WE HAVE TO PROPOSE NEW ONES -- WE SHOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S OING IN AND AND HAVE A US SYSTEMATIC APPROACH -- TO INVENTORYING THAT BOTH THE AN IMPOSSIBLE OUT THANK YOU. TRANSPORT REMEMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT THIS IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD DISCLOSURE TRANSPARENCY BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. HERNANDEZ WAS THE A CAPPELLA FORTY IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. HOW MANY ORGANIZATIONS? YOU KNOW IF ANYONE THIS TIME AT LISETTE BENTLEY BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS THANK YOU IN SUPPORT. MIKE MATTER CONSUMER WATCHDOG IN SUPPORT. OKAY ZERO SEVEN SUPPORT AND YOUR BILL. IT'S GOOD OKAY SO I'M YEAH THIS ONE ARE LIKE HOPEFULLY ALL OF THEM WHO KNOWS. ALL RIGHT LET'S FIND OUT SO WILL -- NOW WHERE FROM FOLKS WHO WANT TO RAISE OPPOSITION. AND UNITS GOT CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. OKAY. SO THE BILLS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS THOUGHTS COMMENTS FROM ANYBODY NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION. NOT YET MISTER MEREDITH WE HAVE A DIRECTION OF WHERE WE THINK THE LEAD AGENCIES GOING TO BE ON THIS. IT SAID THAT THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT. WE MIGHT WANNA [inaudible] PICK. ONE YES WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT. OF MY ABLE CONSULTANT HERE IS SAYING THAT WE THINK IT'LL TAY WITH DOGGER BUT THAT THE AIRPORT IS GOING TO BE. GETTING MORE DIRECTLY INVOLVED. I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING I AND THE DRIVERS BEEN THROUGH A SERIES OF REFORMS BUT HOW SOLID THEY'LL BE -- REMAINS TO BE SEEN THEY'RE NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY BY DESIGN SO. WE CERTAINLY FELL DOWN ON THE JOB DURING THE LEAK I DON'T KNOW. WHEN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE -- REPORTING ON THE CHEMICALS AND ENHANCE. UNDER ENHANCE RECOVERY IN OIL YOU YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR CHEMICALS ARE VIEW YOU COULD YOU CREATE THEM YOU PUT THE MEN. THEN YOU WHEN YOU PRODUCE THE OIL YOU PULL THEM OUT AND YOU HAVE YOU HAVE THAT LEFTOVERS AND YOU CAN DO THE ANALYSIS. HOW IF YOU PUT THE? ENHANCE CHEMICALS IN WITH THE NATURAL GAS YOU SHOULD KNOW WHO THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE BUT IF IT LEAKS OUT HOW WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS -- BECAUSE YOU'RE SOME NATURAL OCCURRING CANNELLA EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THAT. THIS S AN EMPTY OIL FIELD -- SO THERE'S THERE'S LEFTOVER DEPOSIT THAT MIGHT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE CHEMICALS THEY USED ACTUALLY. BRAK. FOR RAIN OR EXTRACT -- SO I GUESS YOU'D HAVE TO DO SOME KIND OF DEDUCTION BASED ON WHAT THE UP FRONT DISCLOSURE IS RIGHT BECAUSE WE WANT TO DISCLOSURE IN ADVANCE. THAT'S THE EASY PART I THINK ANY. WELL I THINK IT SHOULD BE AND I'M AND I'VE HEARD AND I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE CONFIRMATION ON THIS AND WE LOVE EACH USE HELP AND SUPPORT GOING FOR TO DO MORE INVESTIGATION HERE WE HAVE TO DO SOME OVERSIGHT HEARINGS FRANKLY BUT BUT THE CONTINUOUS AIR MONITORING. I'VE HEARD IS NOT STILL OCCURRING AT ALL THE WELL HEADS -- I'D I DON'T HAVE THAT. FOR SURE CONTINUES AIR MONITORING ON ALL OIL AND GAS WELLS RANKLY ANYWHERE WITHIN A A COMMUNITY THAT'S IMPACTED SO THAT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY REASONABLE WAY TO FIGURE OUT -- IF WHAT WINNING IS ALSO WHAT'S COMING OUT. I'M NOT MANAGING YOUR BILL BUT THAT'S A BIG PRICE TAG JUST ONE ON THAT CONTINUOUS MANNER WHAT IS FOR HIM. I MEAN [inaudible] YEAH OKAY. IT'S A COMPLETELY VALID QUESTION. I MISTER CHAIR I RECOGNIZE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS -- BUT I'M WILLING TO MOVE TO BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. BILLS TO MOVE I AND AND YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD JOINT HEARING FOR OUR TO COMMITTEE YEAH I AGREE I AGREE WE'RE GONNA LEAN ON IT AND WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS THING AS IT DEVELOPS SO. WHERE THERE? ALL RIGHT OF GO QUESTION COMMITTEE. BILLS REMOVED I FEEL LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER. THAT THIS RABBLE OKAY SO SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL TO MOVE BY SENATOR CASKEY. ITEM NUMBER TEN AS BEFORE SIXTY THREE THE MATH THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN HI ALLEN AYE BATES. BATES AYE HILL [inaudible] SKINNER. STERN AYE STERN AYE STONE. WHY CASKEY? MAKOWSKI AYE ALL RIGHT DID YOU OF THAT WILL NOW TURN TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN IN YOUR AGENDA MEMBERS THIS IS -- SB SIX THIRTY SIX THIRTEEN IS A MAGICAL NUMBER AND JEWISH FAITH BECAUSE IT'S THE NUMBER OF OF COMMANDMENTS. IN THE BIBLE [inaudible] SO -- WITH THAT WITH THAT WEIGHTY RESPONSIBILITY ASSOCIATE WITH THIS NUMBER. IN MIND. I CANNOT PROMISE -- ANY DIVINE INTERVENTIONS WITH THIS MEASURE -- BUT I CAN PROMISE SOME MODEST PROGRESS -- WE CURRENTLY. PURCHASE AND CONSUME MANY GOODS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH PROCUREMENT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A ANNUAL STATE AGENCY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REPORT CARD. THAT WE THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY EFFECTIVE FOR TRACKING HOW AGENCIES. OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE ARE UNDERTAKEN THEIR CLIMATE COMMITMENTS FOR INSTANCE -- THE LIGHTING IN THIS BUILDING OR THE COMMUTES BEING UNDERTAKEN BY STATE EMPLOYEES OR WHAT KIND OF POWER SOURCES WERE RELYING ON OR THE THE USE OF SAY PAPER OR COMPOSTABLE MATERIALS FOR THE FOOD SYSTEMS THAT YOU'VE LEAD ON THIS ISSUE MISTER CHAIR IN THE PAST -- WERE SAYING HERE THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO APPLY TO THE TO THE FOOD BEING PURCHASED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE THINK IT'S IT COULD ACTUALLY BE A REALLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST. FOR FOR THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF WHAT WE'RE CONSUMING THE STATE BUT ALSO -- FOR IN STATE -- GROWERS OF OF FOOD WE THINK THAT. UNDERSTANDING BETTER THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE FOOD SYSTEM THAT THE STATE'S PROCURING FROM COULD ACTUALLY GIVE -- SOME VALUE TO THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA'S I COMMUNITY IS THE MOST ADVANCED I WOULD SAY IN THE NATION IF NOT THE WORLD. THE EFFICIENCIES WERE ASKING THEM TO UNDERGO GREENHOUSE GAS. REDUCTION TECHNIQUES UNDERGOING IN HEALTHY SOILS ALTERNATE MANY OR MANAGEMENT ALL KINDS OF SECTOR SO WE ACTUALLY TINK THERE'S AN INTERESTING WHEN WHEN TO BE HAD HERE BUT THIS IS A MODEST START THAT WOULD EXPAND THAT INVENTORY TO APPLY THE FOOD SECTOR SO THAT'S THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT -- SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE NO REAL REWRITE THAT. THANK YOU SIR I ANYONE WANTS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND YOU ARE YOUR AVAILABLE IN SUPPORT. GREAT. I THANK YOU I ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION -- IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL. THE NUMBER I WAS FOR THE COMMITTEE THOUGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE NOW YES. MAYBE WE CAN ENTERTAIN A MOTION THERE'S NO BRIDGE OPPOSITION. YES AN AGGRESSION THAT I WOULD HAVE IT WE'RE IN SCOPE THREE ON THE I SCOOPFREE ONIONS ON THE OTHER EMISSIONS AND THESE ARE THE INDIRECT ANTHROPOLOGICAL -- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. ARE YOU BIFURCATING. A THE FOOD. EMISSIONS OR FOOD PROCESSING FEE FROM THIS. AND AT FIRST AS ALL THE OTHER WASTE DISPOSAL. AB BUSINESS TRAVEL EMPLOYEE COMMUTING ALL THE OTHER. BITS AND IF YOU ARE. WHY WHY WOULDYOU JUST THOUGHT YOU ALL OF SCOPE? THREE I'M HERE AT THE THE ONLY REAL A REQUIREMENT THIS BILL IS A IS A METHOD A METHODOLOGY IN ESTIMATES I DON'T THINK IT. PRE DECIDES THAT -- HOW IT'S GONNA BE INTEGRATED EITHER ENDOSCOPE THREE OR ON SOME SEPARATE TRACK I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOME -- SOME ORIGINAL WORK IN TERMS OF HELP WORKING WITH THE AG COMMUNITY ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING BOTH HERE AND WHAT MAYBE NOT. WAS NOT OCCURRING ABROAD BUT I'M OPEN TO INTEGRATION AND SO IT WAS SORT OF FITS INTO THAT BROADER ASSESSMENT OF THE CARBON FOOTPRINT I JUST I JUST KNOW THIS PIECE IS MISSING RIGHT NOW SO. I DON'T I'M I'M NOT -- OKAY RELIGIOUS ABOUT -- EXACTLY HOW IT GETS ANYWAY THAT'S YOUR QUESTION DOES IT GO IN DISCO THREE ONCE THEY DEVELOP THIS METHODOLOGY AND AND AND GET THE REPORT. MORE. COMPREHENSIVE IS A FLOW BACK TO SCOPE THREE OR IS IT'S ON SOME STEPS SEPARATE TRACK IS NOT WHITE I KNOW I ASSUME THAT IT'S IN SCOPE THREE MAYBE I'M MAYBE I'M WRONG ACT. I GOT THE DIRECT ANSWER LOGIC GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THE INDIRECT ONES AND ALL THE OTHER SO I ASSUME THAT THIS IS ALL THE OTHER. AND RIGHT. WITH A SEPARATE CATEGORY OF INDIRECT IS GO TO RIGHT NOW YOU AS WELL MY MY OLD GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING KNOWLEDGE HERE BUT TWO IS ALSO INDIRECT. BUT THREE IS. THINGS LIKE INDIRECT LAND USE IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO FOR BUYING THE FROM. BRAZIL OR AUSTRALIA THAT'S GONNA HAVE BIGGER SCOPE THREE EMISSIONS VERSES. BUYING BEEF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. WE HAVE BETTER DATA ON NOW THE ONE NO I MEAN I I THINK AS IF I'M READING THE STAFF REPORT CORRECTLY. THESE REPORT CARDS A KELPIE HAIR ONLY CONTAINED IN SCOPE ONE SCOPE TO EMISSIONS SO YOU JUST LOOKING FOR SCOPE TO EMISSIONS FOR FOOD. PRODUCTION OR IS IS THIS. JUST SO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING I'M NOT I'M CONFUSED. IF YOU SEE THAT INDIRECT THEN THEY WOULD NORMALLY THEY'RE WORKING ON THE SCOPE TO EMISSIONS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS RIGHT. I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE THREE BUT MAYBE I'M WRONG. YES TO THAT QUESTION WITHOUT -- LOOKING AT I'M TRYING TO MY NAVIGATE THIS. THE CHART RIGHT NOW AND UNDERSTAND WHETHER IT WOULD FALL IN THE SCOPE TWO OR THREE BUT YOU WENT ON A STAMPER -- CERTAINLY THERE. SINCE IN ART ARE IN OUR CONSULTANT IS PRETTY -- CLEAR ON THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD BE SCOPE THREE OKAY THE MISSION. OKAY WELL THEN I GREW THE CONSULTANT. DO YOU DO YOU LIKE THAT DO NOT LIKE THAT I'M I'M STRUCTURE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU KNOW I CAN ARE YOU GOING HERE I WILL USE. THE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THEY WOULD DO ALL PRODUCTS YOU'RE THIS BILL SAYS LOOK AT FOOD PRODUCE PRODUCTS YOU'RE SORT OF SAYING BY FOR KATE. ARE IF THIS BILL PASSCODE SIGNED INTO LAW BY FOR CAPE SCOPE THREE DO THE FOOD PRODUCTS INSTEAD OF DOING ALL THE LIKE BUSINESS TRAVEL AND YEAH. EMPLOYEE COMMUTING AND USE OF OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD WASTE DISPOSAL AND ALL THESE OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION THINKS pOUT. I'M OPEN EXT YOU'RE SAYING JUST TO ADD TO MAKE IT A FULLY COMPREHENSIVE SCOPE THREE FOUR DELVING INTO THAT WORLD SHOULD WHY SHOULD WE COVER EVERYTHING. WELL YOU MIGHT CHECK WITH THE AGENCY I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE GAME PLAN IS AND HOW THE ROLLING OUT. OUT THE STUFF I JUST THAT'S MY QUESTION I WAS JUST OF WELL I I WOULD THE GAME TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO FLESH THAT OUT. FIGURE OUT OF IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO HAVE A MORE EXPANSIVE LOOK AT IT. A LOOK AT INPUT FROM CAL RECYCLE -- I THINK THERE'S COULD ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN A STAFF REPORT SO I APPRECIATE DRILLING DOWN ON THAT AND I'M. VERY OPEN TO IT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THAT TODAY -- BUT YEAH WE WE'VE BEEN JUST TRYING TO GET OUR HEADS WRAPPED AROUND THE FOOD SECTOR FOR A LONG TIME AND IT'S AN EASY ONE TO KICK DOWN THE ROAD IT'S VERY. IT'S IT'S A LOT EASIER TO GET YOUR HEAD WRAPPED AROUND SOME OF THESE OTHER EMISSIONS SECTORS BUT WITH ALL THE EFFORTS GOING ON IN AGRICULTURE IN THIS STATE WE AT LEAST ONE FOR THE STATE PORTION THAT WERE BUYING TO BE -- RECOGNIZING ALL THE GOOD ACTIVITIES GOING ON IN IN THE STATE SO THE SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT METHOD. I KNOW THIS IS A BIT OF A LIKE A LATE GUNMEN -- NO. NOW THE THING IS THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN MEN WASN'T [inaudible] OKAY WELL. IT'S BEEN PRINT REGARDLESS -- I WHY DON'T WE I DID YOU WANT TO MAKE MAYBE. I CAN COMMIT TO WORK WITH BUT I WANT TO OWN A MOVE THE BILL LONG YEAH NO NO I I THINK WE'RE FINE WITH THAT -- BUT THE LET'S LET'S WORK TOGETHER. HI. LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO THE TO KIND OF OWNING MY REVENGE ON WHO IS RUNNING POINT -- STAFF ON THIS. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT OKAY OKAY ALL RIGHT THE NOVEL IDEA OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL WORK WITH YOU I'M MOVING FORWARD ON THIS AND THEN. GET OUT OKAY SO WITH THAT THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED I FEEL LIKE THIS CLOSE. REALLY APPRECIATE THE DILIGENCE. pYOU RAISE SOME GOOD POINTS ABOUT. IF WE'RE GONNA SCOPE IT SCOPE IT ACCURATELY -- AND AND INTEGRATING POWER CYCLE MAKES SOME SENSE HERE SO GAME TO KEEP WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK. OKAY AREN'T [inaudible] I BILLS REMOVED BY SUMMER CASKEY CENTERPIECE CORAL. I REMEMBER THIRTEEN SB SIX ONE THREE BY SENATOR STERN THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND SOMEHOW TO START CHIPPING AWAY AT THE LONGEVITY OF A BROADER STATE COMMITMENT. TO NOT JUST ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY BUT TO OUR BROADER WASTE REDUCTION GOALS I DON'T WANT TO OVER PROMISE WITH THIS BILL IS. IT IS NOT -- THE FINAL ANSWER TO SOLVING THE IMPASSE WE FACE BUT WE KNOW THAT. WHEN IT COMES? TO CURBSIDE RECYCLING EFFORTS THEY'RE THEY'RE FALLING DOWN AND WE'VE WE'VE NOT DONE A GOOD-ENOUGH JOB THERE WE KNOW THAT -- GROCERS ARE NOW. FACED WITH A SITUATION WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE AREAS AND ARE BEING FORCED INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO BE. EITHER FIND OR ADD IN SOME NEW COSTLY INTAKE. MECHANISM SO WE'RE TRYING TO BOTH STIMULATE THE MARKET BOTH ON ADVANCE RECYCLING IN THE PLASTICS AREA CURBSIDE BUT ALSO TO TRY TO FIND [inaudible] SOME. NEW APPROACH AT LEAST NINE THE GROUNDWORK FOR A LITTLE DIFFERENT TAKE ON HOW WE RECYCLE IN THE STATE I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY. SOME OF THOSE NHà OPPOSITION I I'VE BEEN TALKING TO CONSUMER WATCHDOG ABOUT A REPORT THEY JUST PUT OUT SAYING WE NEED TO FOCUS. MORE ON GETTING MORE PEOPLE TO GET THEIR BOTTLES BACK TO THE STORES -- V. IN AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK -- I DON'T COMPLETELY DISAGREE BUT I ALSO THINK THAT -- THE FUTURE MAY LOOK A LOT DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS IN THE PAST AND THIS MODEL BEING ABLE GOOD ON YOUR MOM AND POP GROCERY STORE A LIQUOR STORE DOWN THE STREET AND MAKE THAT. THE WAY YOU OBTAIN YOUR REDEMPTION. MAYBE I'M TO MILLENNIAL BUT I DON'T I I DON'T ANTICIPATE DRIVING AROUND TOWN. LOOKING FOR PLACES TO DROP OFF MY RECYCLING AND GET SOME REDEMPTION BACK I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME UP WITH SMARTER DISTRIBUTED STRATEGIES. IMPROVE YOUR GAME ON CURBSIDE IMPROVING SOME OF THE PLASTIC RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY SO THIS PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF NEAR TERM SUPPORT INTO WHAT REALLY OUGHT TO BE A LONG TERM FIX AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT. CHAIR EMERITUS OF PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE MUCH BIGGER WE'LL LAST YEAR AND YEARS BEFORE THAT. AND I DON'T WANNA IN P. THAT EFFORT IN ANY WAY. YEAH I KNOW IT SHOWS. THAT HE DID NOT DISLOCATED THOUGH. STILL ON SO. WHAT WE NEED TO SOLVE THE BIGGER PROBLEM BUT WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FIRST STEP -- AND THAT SORT OF MODEST NEAR TERM FIX I MOVED GOT A INTERESTING COALITION HERE SO LET ME JUST START BY ASKING FOR YOUR AYE OTE -- BUT PASSING OVER TO MARK MURRAY WITH CALIFORNIANS WASTE AND THEN -- MISTER KENNEDY FROM THE A ROPE COUNTY I GOT THAT RIGHT YES.% MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE SUN YEAH MARK MURRAY WITH THE REBEL GROUP CALIFORNIA'S GUESS WASTE -- I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING -- EXCELLENT ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF SUMMARIZING THE PROBLEM IN IDENTIFYING WHAT THIS BILL DOES AS AS NOTED THIS IS NOT -- THE COMPREHENSIVE LONG TERM FIX THIS IS A SHORT TERM BUT REALLY NECESSARY IMMEDIATE FIX TO REINSTATE FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN FUND THE RICH IN RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S LEFT AND AND PROVIDE A OF FUNDING PROMISE. TO THE RECYCLERS THAT HAVE CLOSED THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE RECYCLING CENTERS THAT HAVE CLOSED IN THE STATE SO THAT WE CAN OPEN THOSE CENTERS BACK UP. AND JUST FUN FACT ON THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE RECYCLING CENTERS THAT HAVE CLOSED IN THE STATE. ONLY HALF OF THOSE WERE SUPERMARKET CONVENIENCE ON RECYCLING CENTERS HALF OF THE RECYCLING CENTERS THAT HAVE. CLOSED WERE WHAT WE CALL OLD LINE RECYCLERS ON THAT BOARD SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT RECYCLING CENTERS -- SO THERE IS A MIX OF OPERATIONS. THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS AS WELL AS AS CURBSIDE RECYCLING. ARM ONE UP -- APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF A ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERVISOR RICHARD BY A WHO WAS HERE THIS MORNING AND AND THROUGH LUNCH BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO STICK AROUND. TO HAVE THIS BILL HEARD AND HE IS HE'S PREPARED SOME EXCELLENT. TESTIMONY HERE -- THAT HE ASKED ME TO READ I I WON'T READ ALL THAT TESTIMONY BUT HE'S HE DOES HAVE A VERY POWERFUL CONCLUSION HERE THAT I WANTED TO REFERENCE AND HE SO. RICHARD OR SUPERVISOR OF BY A IN ADDITION TO BEING AN ELECTED OFFICIAL HE RUNS A NONPROFIT RECYCLING CENTER THAT DOES BOTH BUYBACK RECYCLING IN THE EAST BAY AS WELL AS CURBSIDE RECYCLING. AND HIS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY AFFECTED BY THIS DROP IN FUNDING -- SO WE'RE WE'RE IN THIS CRISIS BECAUSE OF A A DROP IN SCRAP VALUE FUNDING BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE PROCESSING PAYMENT MECHANISMS IN THE LAW. FAILED TO COME UP WITH THE BILL TO COVER THE NET COST RECYCLING PRECISELY WHEN WE NEEDED THEM TO AND CAL RECYCLE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. AND THEY HAVE THE SURPLUS THAT'S GROWING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SPEND THE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE THE OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS S HE SAYS PLEASE. FOCUS ON FIXING WHAT'S BROKEN IN THE USE SURPLUS PROGRAM REVENUE TO RETURN RECYCLING CENTER FUNDING TO THE TWENTY FIFTEEN LEVELS. PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO RE OPEN CLOSE RECYCLING CENTERS IN RURAL AND OTHER UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE. ARM AND PLEASE DIRECT CAL RECYCLE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON LONGER TERM FIXES TO EXPAND RECYCLING. IN TO ENSURE FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES THOSE THREE THINGS. ARM. I'M YOU KNOW AGAIN THE ANALYSIS. DESCRIBES THE PROBLEM -- I'M HAD HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE -- IN ADDITION URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU MARK THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE RURAL COUNTIES. IT WAS HAS BEEN REFERENCED A RELATIVELY RECENT CLOSURE OF ALL THOSE RECYCLING CENTERS HAS HAD A REAL REALLY DEBILITATING IMPACT ON CONSUMERS I'M ONE OF THOSE CONSUMERS WHO HAS DRIVEN AROUND MY LOCAL CITY LOOKING FOR RECYCLING CENTERS. AND CAN SPEAK TO THE FRUSTRATION. IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A WAY TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK AND WITHOUT CONVENIENT COLLECTION OR REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES THE BOTTLE BILL OFTEN BECOMES A REGRESSIVE TAX. IT'S IN NO ONE'S BEST INTEREST SO WE REALLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AS A STOPGAP SOLUTION TO HELP SUSTAIN HE EXISTING RECYCLING CENTERS THAT ARE OUT THERE TO PREVENT MORE FROM CLOSING. AND WE THINK IT CAN REALLY HELP INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE IN RURAL AREAS WE HAVE SOME RURAL COUNTIES THAT HAVE NO REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES OR OF HAD NO REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES. FOR PERIODS OF TIME AND THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE -- FOR CONSUMERS OUT THERE SO IN THE ABSENCE OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION WE THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE AND DEFINITELY SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU. I SHOULD JUST THAT I'M SURE I SHOULD MENTION IN MY OPENING BUT WE DID WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AND ACCEPTED THERE'S A THERE'S A COMMITTEE AMENDMENT THAT SUGGESTS. STRIKING SUBDIVISION H. WHICH WOULD. WHICH WOULD WOULD HAVE PROPOSED A ONE MILE RADIUS INCREASE -- BUT WE'RE WILLING TO THE STRIKE THAT'S WE APPRECIATE THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION ONE EXCEPT THAT MEMBERS THIS IS AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE. NINE AND THE US STAFF REPORT THANK YOU. FOR THE CLARIFICATION JOHN. ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF A SB SEVEN TWENTY FOUR THESE COMPORT. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. STEPHANIE MARBLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEELS AND CONVENIENCE ALLIANCES WELLS RECOLOGY IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL DAFT WITH REPUBLIC SERVICES IN SUPPORT. FIFTY FAN OF HAVE RE PLANET AS PART. IT'S LIKE IT US HERE WE HAVE ALWAYS ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA IN SUPPORT. HELLO I'M CHEN ABIT I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PROTECT YOUR BE WHERE A TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THOSE SMALL INDEPENDENT RECYCLERS. I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID HERE TODAY. CURBSIDE IS DIFFERENT FROM REDEMPTION REDEMPTION. CONSUMERS GET THEIR MONEY BACK. BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WE NEED THE RELIEF. JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF WASTE MANAGEMENT SUPPORT. GARCIA CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF A CONSERVATION CHORUS IN SUPPORT. LARA FRONTERA BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. AMARILLO MAP THE COMPANY GROW SENSATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S HEAR FROM OPPOSITION. PLEASE REMEMBER MIKE MATIC CONSUMER WATCHDOG AND FIRST I WANT THANK US SENATORS OR STERN. FOR MESSING UP MY A SPEECH YEARS SORRY TOOK ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS SO I HAVE TO JUST QUICKLY -- THE AGAIN. I JUST LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO TO OUTLINE THE PROBLEM THEN ANOTHER MINUTE TO OFFER A COUPLE. SOLUTIONS. THE CALIFORNIA EVERYONE'S PAYS DEPOSITS FOR THE VETERANS AS THEY BY AND WE ARE ENTITLED TO GET OUR OUR NICHOLS BACK OR SEE THEM USED TO IMPROVE RECYCLING AND TAKE CARE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT. INSTEAD CONSUMERS ARE FORFEITING ALMOST HALF OF EVERY NICKEL RECYCLING CENTERS ARE CLOSING RIGHT AND LEFT. AND THE QUALITY OF RECYCLING IS DROPPING. CALIFORNIA RECYCLING REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL RESTRUCTURING -- AND THAT WE CAN AGREE ONE I'M NO WHERE NEAR MILLENNIAL BUT I AGREE WITH SENATOR STERN ON THE LONG TERM FIX IS DEFINITELY NECESSARY [inaudible] I'M. CALIFORNIA'S LAW IS BROKEN AND BOTH CONSUMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE PAYING A HUGE PRICE I THINK SENATOR STERN'S BILL. MAY BE THE VEHICLE TO JUMP START A REAL FIX MOVING FORWARD -- THE BOTTLE BILL OBLIGATES GROCERIES DRUGS IN CONVENIENCE STORES AND OTHER BEVERAGE DEALERS. TO TO RECYCLE INTO CONTAINERS AND PAY CONSUMERS IF NO RECYCLING CENTER EXISTS IN THAT HALF A MILE NOW WE'RE GONNA KEEP. AROUND THE MAJOR SUPERMARKET JUST WHEN RECYCLING CENTERS ARE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS AND 40% OF CLOSEDRECENT YEARS. GROCERY STORES ARE REFUSING TO FOLLOW THE LAW. CONSUMER WATCHDOG RECENTLY CONDUCTED A THREE MONTH STUDY HERE IT IS. YOU GUYS HAVE IT OR NOT USING IT AS COASTERS I CAN PASS OUT SOME MORE ON THE WAY OUT -- THE PRIMARY REASON IS BECAUSE THE STATE RECYCLING SYSTEM LEAVES CONSUMERS YOUR OPTIONS EVERY YEAR WHERE TO REDEEM. THEIR ANTES WHILE LEADING THE GROCERY CHANGE. BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS AND TRASH HAULERS TO GET RICH AT THE CONSUMERS EXPENSE. ACCORDING THE LA OWES TWENTY SEIZE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REVIEW OF THE STATE'S NO OTHER STATE. HAS EXPERIENCED THE SAME PRECIPITOUS LOSS IN THE NUMBER OF RECYCLING CENTERS OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S KIND OF ALARMING FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES OF LOS TWO THIRDS. OTHER CENTERS IN JUST FIVE YEARS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AS LOSS OF COURSE THE MOST. ABOUT A HUNDRED NAY. AND CURRENTLY RETAIL CHAINS INCLUDING SOME OF THE BUSINESS WALLS MARK SAM'S CLUB SAFE WAY ALBERTSONS VONS PAVILIONS ARE SERVING ABOUT 64%. OF THE CONVENIENCE ZONES. SO AS TO THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUE. LET'S JUST GIVE ONE EXAMPLE. CAL RECYCLE FOUND THAT WALMART HAD UNDER REPORTED SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DEPOSITS. DESPITE REPEATEDLY BEING CAUGHT UNDER COUNTING DEPOSITS BUT THE STATE CAL REESE'S CAL RECYCLE NEVER FIND WALMART. THEY WERE NEVER THEY WERE TOLD NEARLY TO REPAY WHAT THEY OWED ANYWAY THAT'S NOT REALLY A MUCH OF A AN INCENTIVE TO FOLLOW THE LAW. SO AS TO THE SOLUTION WE WOULD OFFER -- I WILL TAKE SOLUTION ONE NOW WHICH WAS THE HALF A MILE. THANK YOU CENTER STERLING AND REQUIRE HOW BIG STORES SELLING BEVERAGES INCLUDING CHAINS CONVENIENCE BIG BOX AND GROCERY STORES GROSSING MORE THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO OFFER REDEMPTION SERVICES. SECOND HAVE CARL RECYCLE PERFORM FREQUENT SURPRISE INSPECTIONS AND IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL FINES AGAINST STORES THAT TURN CONSUMERS AWAY IN VIOLATE THE LAW [inaudible] PRETTY SIMPLE. IN CLOSING WE NEED TO MAKE RECYCLING EASIER FOR CONSUMERS NOT HARDER OTHERWISE BOTH CONSUMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- GONNA LOSE. NOW WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHETHER IT LOOKS LIKE A EUROPEAN MODEL A NOR WHERE WHERE WE HAVE VENDING MACHINE TYPE WITH PLATFORMS AND DROPPING THEM AND THAT'S IT LOTS IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND IT. IS CLEAN THE AND ARE RECYCLING MATERIALS A DONE AND IT'S EASY TO FIND YOU CAN STICK THEM ANYWHERE. WHATEVER THAT'S GOING TO BE. THAT'S THE LONG TERM APPROACH THAT SENATOR STERN MASSES HOW IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA LOOK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORKING UP IT HAS TO BE DONE. SO WE WILL -- WE LIKE A SHORT TERM FIX TO GO THROUGH. WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE CONSIDERED AND WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO HAVING A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF OUR RECYCLING SYSTEM BY THE LEGISLATOR AND LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION ASK INVOLVED TOO SO. THAT'S IT. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION MY NAME IS LEONARD LYING I'M FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND I'VE CONSULTED WITH -- RECYCLERS FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE PROGRAM SINCE THE BEGINNING. I AM AN EXPERT [inaudible] UP. I'M HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE SERIOUS ERRORS OF FACT IN. BOTH THE CONSUMER WATCHDOG REPORT. AND IN THE ANALYSIS FOR THIS BILL AND I THINK IF THOSE WERE CLARIFIED WE COME UP WITH MUCH BETTER BILL I AM OPPOSED TO THE BILL UNLESS AMENDED. AND I'VE SUBMITTED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO FIX THIS PROGRAM. THE KEY IS THE CLOSURES ARE BASED UPON ONE COMPANY CLOSING HUNDREDS. THE NEXT ISSUE OF CLOSURES ARE REVOCATIONS BY CAL RECYCLE SUCH AS IN AMADOR COUNTY RECENTLY FORTUNATELY THAT WE FIX THAT -- THEY WANTED TO REMOVE ONE OF THREE RECYCLERS WITHIN THE COUNTY. OF THE NEXT IS. CALORIE CYCLE HAS DENIED APPLICATIONS TO REFILL THESE ON AND THEN CITIES HAVE BEEN WORKING AGAINST RECYCLING. TO REMOVE RECYCLERS BECAUSE OF HOMELESS ISSUES. THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS HOW MANY UNSUBSIDIZED RECYCLERS HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS THAT'S THE NUMBER YOU NEED TO KNOW AND THIS BILL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP THEM. THIS AYE YEAH. THREE FALSE ALARMS THIS WITH A CALL YOU TO GO TO THE COMMITTEE AND THEN ANOTHER AUTHORS THERE AND IT'S LIKE. UNION LEADER ON COMMITTEE WELL. SO I DON'T KNOW I WAS TRYING TO GET THE CLIFF'S NOTES ON YOUR PRESENTATION BUT I OTHER FOLKS WANTED. ONE IT YEAH RIGHT I AREA I'M. ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO RAISE OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. OKAY I MIGHT MAKE MUCH ABOUT MARK AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION DEBATE I KNOW THIS IS THIS IS AN ISSUE IT ETCETERA CASKEY ESPECIALES WORKED ON PRETTY INTENSELY FOR A LONG TIME -- SO LET'S LET'S OPEN UP THE FLOOR. TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE TO DEBATE DISCUSS AND OUR CENTER WITH DISLOCATED SHOULDER -- IF WELL. YOU STILL BEYOND THE NOT THE DISLOCATED. I'M SO ANY ANY QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS DISCUSSION. NO I GET I GUESS YOU KNOW I DID NOT. EMBRACE THE BANDAID TECHNIQUE. BUT LAST YEAR AND THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING. BETTER BUT I ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM OUT IN THE STREET WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING I'M THERE'S NOTHING. AT WITH THE WITH THE AMENDMENTS -- OBVIOUSLY THE OPPOSITION HAS WOULD LIKE MORE AMENDMENTS TO OF WHICH DANCE. AB TWO OUT OUTRAGEOUS -- I JUST AS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO CONSIDERED CONTINUED HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LARGER REFORM I MEAN IT SAYS WE'LL BE BACK HERE IN TWO YEARS TALK ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEMS. I SAID THIS IS A THREE YEAR THREE YEAR SORT OF THAT'S LET THE ADMINISTRATION COME TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW I'M. WE'LL DO MY WORK IN. THIS IS A TWO YEAR SESSION THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. LEAVE IT AT THAT. IF YOU HAVE A I JUST GOT CENTER HOW I'M OF THE BILL. I JUST WANTED TO ADD MY COMMENTS TO SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE'S AN IMMEDIATE AND APPLAUD HIS GREAT EFFORTS -- AND THE STRUGGLES THAT THE TO DEAL WITH THIS THIS IS ONGOING PROBLEM AND I APPRECIATE. OF THE AUTHOR'S ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO TAKE IT ON I DO I RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN AND I THINK IS. pWOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A FIX THAT WE CAN DEPEND ON RELY ON AND MOVE FORWARD WITH -- I I DON'T KNOW IF. THIS IS WILL GET US THERE IN THIS SHORT TIME FRAME SO I HOPE. THAT IS BECAUSE TO ME YOU COULD BE THIS COULD BE IN THE WHOLE THING COULD BE DONE IF IF YOU. CAN WORK AT IT AND AND NOW I'M CERTAIN WANTED SUPPORTED KEEP IT GOING. BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN KIND OF WORK ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT IN GETTING US TO THAT [inaudible] SPECIAL SPOT. CHOOSE UP IN THE THAT WOULD. WOULD WORK. THAT WOULD WORK. THE SPECIALS FIVE LIVE SPECIALS BY. AND I'LL JUST SAY I I DON'T. BETWEEN CENTER SKINNER WHO WAS WORKING ON WASTE. YOU KNOW BEFORE WE EVEN CALL THE WAYS I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU CALL THAT. BACK WHEN YOU WORKED ON THE FIRST STYROFOAM BAND AND CENTER ALLEN ON PLASTICS. FIRST 50% SO. I'M YOU KNOW I'M A LITTLE -- OUT RANKED HERE IN TERMS OF EXPERTISE BETWEEN. THE CENTER Y. CASKEY. BUT I'LL JUST COMMIT MYSELF TO DOING THAT WORK AND NOT JUST TRY TO SAY A BANDAIDS GONNA SELL BECAUSE I I REALLY THE THIS ISN'T THE TOTAL ANSWER WE'VE GOT TO GET THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS THOUGH OR AT LEAST THIS YEAR. AND TRY TO FIND SOME NEAR TERM WAY TO DEAL WITH NATIONAL STORED RE STIMULATE THE MARKET IN SOME MEANINGFUL WAY BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE WAY THAT BIGGER PROGRESS IN FACT AYE AYE SIR TO CONSIDER THIS BILL. AN IMPLICIT COMMITMENT TO HELP SOLVE THAT BIGGER PROBLEM SO ON THEIR ON THEIR AND I CANNOT WAIT TILL NEXT SESSION CENTER WE CAST YOU CENTER SKINNER. I'M. THE INTERESTING THING IS THE VETO MESSAGE ON GLAZERS BILL WHICH WAS VERY COMPARABLE TO THIS LAST YEAR HAD TO DO WITH. THE PROBLEM OF THE BUDGET. MEANING THE IN OUR ACCOUNTS OR OUR RESOURCE FUND IS AN ADEQUATELY FUNDED. BUT IN FACT. THE ONE OF THE ISSUES IN YOUR FINDINGS ARE YOUR ARGUMENTS -- DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THAT WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE COLLAPSE WITH HE UNWILLINGNESS OF COUNTRIES IN ASIA TO BUY WHAT WE NO LONGER CONSIDER VALUABLE. WHICH IS OUR WHOLE RECYCLING PROGRAM WAS BASED ON THEIR BUYING OUR JUNK. AND I NOW THAT THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN BECAUSE EVERYBODY TALKS NATIONALS WORK BUT RIGHT REALLY IS GOING ON WASTE IS A VERB IT IS NOT A NOUN SOMETHING IS NOTWASTE UNTIL IT IS WASTED. WE WASTE MANY MORE THINGS. BASICALLY POOR COUNTRIES DON'T WASTE AS MUCH WHEN THEY GET RICHER THEY BECOME LIKE US SO THEY GOT THEIR OWN JUNK. SO NOW WE HAVE ALL THIS STUFF THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH [inaudible] BUT WE ALSO HAVE. BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE'VE DECIDED TO DO CURBSIDE IN MOST PLACES NOT MY CITY. WE MIX EVERYTHING AND IT BECOMES CONTAMINATED SO THE ONLY THING. I AM NOT A I DO NOT OPPOSE THE BILL BUT I DO THINK THAT. UNTIL WE HAVE OUR OWN MARKETS WE DO YOU NEED TO TRY TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN. THOSE PLACES WHERE THIS MATERIAL CAN BE RECEIVED. UNCONTAMINATED BECAUSE THE C. R. V. STREAM. IS A STREAM THAT CHINA IS STILL BUYING. IT IS OUR CURBSIDE THAT THEY'RE NOT BUYING SO IT. THIS IS. I WILL NOT IS ANY KIND OF INSULT BUT IT ISN'T IN ELEGANT FIX THOUGH IT IS UNNECESSARY FIX FOR THIS MOMENT BUT WE HAVE TO GET THAT THE FIX THAT ALLOWS US TO BOTH HAVE A STREAM. AND CREATE SOME MARKETS CLEAN STREAM IN SOME MARKETS. YEAH I MEAN A I AGREE AND I I THINK ALSO WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AS WE GO AND COMPLETELY TRY TO RELY ON CURBSIDE RECYCLING FOR EVERYTHING AND YET THEY'RE INADEQUATE. THEN YOU BASICALLY THROW EVERYTHING IN THE LANDFILL ANYWAY BECAUSE AS THE REPORT POINTED OUT. YOU ARE AT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RATE IS AT WITH THE AVERAGE IN THERE. SO IT'S MILLION LESS YOUR CHANCES GO OR BERKELEY WHERE PEOPLE ARE UPSTREAM CONSUMERS THEMSELVES ARE BEING EXTRA DILIGENT ON THE FRONT AND PAYING FOR THE CURB THE STILL SEPARATE SO ARE. YEAH OUR PROCESSING FACILITY. IS RIGHT NOW HAVING LESS PROBLEM WITH THE PURCHASE BECAUSE OUT YOUR ARMOR BECAUSE WE HAVE CLEAN LOADS NOT A 100% BUT AND NOT A LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES DO. COMPLETELY AGREE OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO. LOT MORE WORK TO DO. I THE BILL I THINK IS TO MOVE BY CINEMA CASKEY -- WITH THAT WELL IF YOU CLOSE CENTER [inaudible] YOU -- THE QUICK LOOK WE'VE WE'VE TRIED IT WE TRIED TO BE RESPONSIVE AND AND AND THERE IS SOME OF THAT IMPROVE COLLECTION BEING ADDRESSED HERE THERE IS SOME INCENTIVE FOR THE INNOVATIVE RECYCLING TECHNIQUES IN TRYING TO RE STIMULATE THE MARK I THINK YOU. THAT IS IN HERE IS IT ENOUGH NO. IS IT IS IT THAT FIX THAT THAT LONGER TERM SOLUTION NOTE SO AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO OVER PROMISE BUT I THINK JUST RESTORING RECYCLING INCENTIVE TO GET BACK TO AT LEAST TWENTY FIFTEEN LEVELS. AND TRYING TO REFOCUS THE CAL RECYCLE RESOURCES ON TO GETTING TO THESE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IS A POSITIVE STEP -- SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN PROMISE AT LEAST IN THIS YEAR THAT WILL HAVE IF IF FOR THE NEXT YEAR IF THIS BILL PASSES WILL BE ABLE. TO RESTORE SOME RECYCLING MARKET PLACE BUT I DON'T THINK IS ENOUGH TO COMPETE WITH NATIONAL SOARED -- IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN THAT AND I'M GONNA MAKE SOME OF THOSE HARD DECISIONS TO DO THAT SO IF THIS ENDS UP BEING IF THE STARS ALIGNED COVER CYCLE IN THIS GOVERNOR ENGAGES IN WE ACTUALLY A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. I'M ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO TO BRING THAT IN BUT YEAH I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE TODAY IN LOOKING AT HOW -- TO DEAL WITH A VERY AWKWARD CURRENT SITUATION -- OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS INCREDIBLY LANDMARK PROGRAM SO THAT ESPECIALLY ESCRIBIR. THANK YOU OKAY I THINK TO PLEASE CALL. ITEM NUMBER TWENTY SB SEVEN TWENTY FOUR BY SENATOR STERN THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN. ALLEN AYE BATES. HILL. HILL AYE SKINNER. I STERN STERN AYE STONE. WHITE HOUSE GAME. I CASKEY I AWESOME ALL RIGHT WELL THAT WE WILL LEAVE OPEN FOR OTHER FOLKS TO ADD ON THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I KNOW THE CENTER WILL CONTINUE WORKING -- EXTENSIVELY WITH THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S NEXT YEAR FROM CENTER SKINNER WHO'S HERE TO PRESENT SB FORTY NINE THIS IS ITEM NUMBER THREE IN YOUR AGENDAS MEMBERS. INOCULATED TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY. YEAH AND SO CENTERS CAN YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THANK YOU SO MUCH. SB [inaudible] FORTY NINE A WE'RE GONNA MY TEEPEES NO LIKE ALRIGHT HOW DO I JUST EXPLAIN THIS BILL SIMPLY. OUR ARMED ENERGY COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO SET ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO TO MAKE A POINT STANDARDS BASED ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS ABSOLUTELY STOOD STILL BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BECAUSE IT REFLECTS NEGA WHAT'S. BUT AS WE EXPAND NOW TO RENEWABLES. AND AS WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE. OUR DEMAND ON OUR ELECTRICITY SYSTEM. IS VERY BOLD DURING HE DAY WE HAVE THESE PEAK TIMES. IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE CAPACITY. TO HAVE [inaudible] SMART APPLIANCES THAT IF OUR ENERGY COMMISSION WAS EMPOWERED TO SET STANDARDS FOR THOSE APPLIANCES TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO DEMAND MANAGEMENT. THEN THEY COULD BE SET TO BE USED DURING TIMES THAT ARE PEAK OR DURING TIMES WHEN RENEWABLES ARE GENERATING THE HIGHEST. AND UTILIZE OUR ELECTRICAL RESOURCES BETTER SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S A KIND OF FUNNY. IT ALLOWS THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO FACTOR THAT DEMAND MANAGEMENT IN AND IT DOES SO THROUGH USING THE LANDS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. ALL THE ONLY LENDS THEY CAN USE IS INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY SO THAT'S IN EFFECT WHAT THE BILL DOES. AND I HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GREAT THANK YOU I MY NAME IS LILLIAN MARVIS I AM A GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER AT HOME CAN ACT WERE OF RESIDENTIAL A DEMAND RESPONSE OFFER COMPANY. DOWN IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE THAT OWN CONNECTS THE PORTS SB. FORTY NINE AS CALIFORNIA STRIVES TO MEET ITS SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE DEMAND OF ELECTRICITY MATCHES WHEN THAT SUPPLIES CLEANEST ME THAT THERE IS HIGH PENETRATION OF THE NOBLES ON THE GRADE. UNDER SB FORTY NINE WE'LL SEE HOME DEVICES TRANSFORM FROM JUST BEING ON OFF YOU KNOW TURN ON AND USE IT WHENEVER YOU NEED AT TO BECOMING SMARTER AND GREAT CONNECTED TO THAT THOSE DEVICES RESPOND TO GRADE CONDITIONS. THOSE CAN GRADE CONDITIONS ARE NOT ONLY REFLECTIVE OF WHEN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE LOW BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE INDICATIVE OF REAL TIME PRICING SELLING PRICES ARE LOW AS WELL. WHERE OWN CONNECT IS MOST EXCITED ABOUT SB FORTY NINE IS THAT IT ALLOWS? EVERYDAY CONSUMERS OF ELECTRICITY SO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM TO BE A PART OF CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION SO THE DEVICES IN OUR HOME CAN ACTUALLY INTEGRATE RENEWABLES AND FACILITATE THAT PROCESS. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY I ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN AND CATCH THE TRAIN BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE FOLLOW UP WITH ME AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE [inaudible] THANKS. NEXT AT FIFTY PHÃN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EFFICIENCY INTERIM MANAGEMENT COUNCIL WE ARE STATEWIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION OF COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND A MAN RESPONSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES -- IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB.
