SITUATIONS. SO. IT WAS A IT WAS

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:52.751
A- VERY PROBLEMATIC. MOVED BY

00:20:52.818 --> 00:20:53.919
BY OUR FELLOW CITIZENS AT THE

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.153
TIME BUT THE GOLDEN STATE HAS

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.388
CHANGED A LOT SINCE NINETEEN

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:57.956
FIFTY OUR SOCIETY HAS HAD VERY

00:20:58.023 --> 00:20:58.590
DIFFERENT ATTITUDES ABOUT RACE

00:20:58.657 --> 00:20:59.825
AND ETHNICITY CLASS AND POVERTY

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:01.560

NEW HOUSING THAT DID NOT EXIST

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:08.800
BACK IN IN NINETEEN FIFTY THERE

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:09.534

LAWSUITS. SO THE GAME IS

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.508

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:19.544

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.349
AS A RESULT ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:25.283
REALLY DOES STAND AS AN

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.718
ANACHRONISTIC CONSTITUTIONAL

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:45.504
OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THE

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.738

THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHILDREN.

00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:33.458

HOMELESSNESS FROM GROWING.

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:44.746

INFLATION. IT'S ANOTHER THING

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:23.384
ONE RENTERS ARE ROUTINELY

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:25.453

DOUBLING TRIPLING THE RENT IN

YOU ACHIEVE HOUSING STABILITY

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:47.609

FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL HELP

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:58.953
TO DO THAT BY PUTTING A VERY

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:02.290
REASONABLE CAP IN PLACE 5% FROM

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:03.758
IMPORTANT PLOT BY PERCENT PLUS

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.494

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:08.530
REASONABLE CAP FROM A LANDLORDS

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:12.834
PERSPECTIVE AND BASIC JUST

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.603
THAN TWICE MEMBERS THE MINIMUM

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:31.205
WAGE. THAT IS WHY A MAJORITY OF

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:33.074
RENTERS ARE SPENDING MORE THAN

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:36.077
HALF. OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:36.711
AND ACCORDING TO OUR OWN

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:39.714
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S MEMBERS

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:41.949
HOUSEHOLDS ARE CONSIDERED RENT

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.685
TO BURDEN. IF THEY SPEND OVER

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:46.454
30% JUST OVER 30% OF THEIR

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:49.190
HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON RENT. OUR

INCOME RENTERS ARE RED BURDEN.

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:04.038
EXTRAORDINARY THINK ABOUT THAT

01:29:04.105 --> 01:29:05.873
HOW MANY HOUSEHOLDS ARE

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:07.408
SPENDING MOST OF THEIR INCOME

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:09.444
JUST TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:13.381
HEAD. IT IS TRUE WHEN THEY SAY

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:15.717
THE RENT IS JUST TOO HIGH. NOT

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:18.453
ONLY IS IT HIGH BUT ONLY A HUNT

FORM OF LOCAL RENT CONTROL.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.901
THAT MEANS MEMBERS. MILLIONS OF

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:35.269
CALIFORNIANS ARE VULNERABLE TO

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:37.071
EXCESS RENT INCREASES OR

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:40.274
VACATION WITHOUT COST. MANY

01:29:40.341 --> 01:29:40.708
FRAGILE FAMILIES AND

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:43.044
INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE.

01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:44.512
LARGE RENT INCREASES CAN BE THE

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:46.681

ANGELES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:11.332
TO BE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BUT

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:12.967
THE FIRST I'D LIKE TO MENTION

01:36:13.033 --> 01:36:15.069
IS THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:16.904
OVERWHELMINGLY. REJECTED RENT

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:24.011
CONTROL. RECENTLY. JUST LAST

01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:25.846
YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:28.549
CALIFORNIANS VOTED NO ON PROP

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:29.517
TEN WHICH FAILED NOT BY A FEW

01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:31.952
PERCENTAGE POINTS MY FRIENDS

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:35.022
IFILL BY NINETEEN POINTS. I

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:37.591
GUESS THE LEGISLATURE IS JUST

01:36:37.658 --> 01:36:38.192
FOLLOWING THE GOVERNOR'S LEAD

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:38.759
AND IGNORING THE WILL OF THE

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:39.927
VOTERS. FIRST IT WAS A DEATH

01:36:39.994 --> 01:36:44.532
PENALTY. NOW IT'S RENT CONTROL.

01:36:44.598 --> 01:36:47.535
THE PEOPLE OF SPOKEN AND WE ARE

01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:48.102
IGNORING THAT AND BELIEVE ME

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:50.237
THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION. THAT

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.772
DOESN'T SOMEONE DEMOCRACY TO ME

01:36:51.839 --> 01:36:53.107
BUT I'M GETTING USED TO THAT

01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:54.975
PRACTICE IN THIS BUILDING. WITH

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:56.377
THIS GOVERNOR. AND THIS

01:36:56.443 --> 01:37:00.781
LEGISLATURE. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:02.550
TWO WILL ALSO CREATE MAJOR

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:05.152
HOUSING MARKET INSTABILITY

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:07.321
WHICH WILL ONLY PERPETUATE OUR

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:07.888
STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS EVEN

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:11.592
MORE. MAYBE WE SHOULD LEARN

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:14.161
FROM LESSONS FROM OTHER STATES.

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:15.863
MIKE ORGAN WHO VOTED IN A RENT

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:18.165
CONTROL. MEASURE THREE MONTHS

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:22.036
AGO. ALREADY IN THE STATE OF

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:25.072
OREGON THERE'S BEEN A 38%

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:26.807
DECREASE IN MULTI FAMILY

01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:28.842
INVESTMENT IS THAT WHAT WE WANT

01:37:28.909 --> 01:37:30.077
CALIFORNIA'S A DECREASE

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:31.612
INVESTMENT IN MULTI FAMILY

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:33.380
INVESTMENT ESPECIALLY BY THE

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:34.615
BIG PLAYERS SO WE HAVE A

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.183
SHORTAGE OF HOUSING AND YOU ALL

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:39.086
KNOW THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:39.687
EQUATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:37:39.753 --> 01:37:40.287
SUPPLY. THE RICH ARE GOING TO

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:43.524
GO UP. WE'RE GONNA GO

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:44.858
ESPECIALLY IN THE NEWER UNITS

01:37:44.925 --> 01:37:46.227
THERE ARE TO BE EVEN MORE ON

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:47.661
AFFORDABLE ESPECIALLY WITH THE

01:37:47.728 --> 01:37:49.730
MANDATES THAT THIS. IS A TO

01:37:49.797 --> 01:37:53.467
SHIP PLACES ON ON BUILDERS.

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:54.401
HOUSING INVESTORS AND

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:56.136
DEVELOPERS ARE NOT STUPID

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:57.471
PEOPLE THEY KNOW THAT RENT

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:59.106
CONTROL PROVIDES NO MARKET

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:01.642
STABILITY AND WHO WOULD RESTORE

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:02.209
MONEY TIME AND INVESTMENT ON

01:38:02.276 --> 01:38:04.878
INSTABILITY. WHEN CERTAINLY

01:38:04.945 --> 01:38:06.313
THERE ARE OTHER PLACES THEY CAN

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.349
GO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:09.984
THEIR INVESTMENTS HAMSTRING ARE

01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:11.986
HAMSTRUNG THE WAY THE STATE OF

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:14.054
CALIFORNIA IS TRYING TO DO THAT.

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:15.322
MAYBE OUR CONSTITUENTS WILL

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:17.491
HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO MOVE TO

01:38:17.558 --> 01:38:21.061
TEXAS TO ARIZONA. THE FLORIDA.

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:25.599
IDAHO TO NEVADA. FOR TENNESSEE

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:26.166
AND THAT'S JUST OUR RHETORIC

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:29.403
THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING.

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:30.804
FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO

01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:33.073
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THOSE

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.408
STATES HAVE SEEN THREE HUNDRED

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:36.443
AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND NEW

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:39.380
HOUSING UNITS BUILT. BUT

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:40.281
CALIFORNIA'S ONLY SEEN A

01:38:40.347 --> 01:38:40.914
HUNDRED THOUSAND. UNITY

01:38:40.981 --> 01:38:44.852
INCREASE. DO YOU USE THE NUMBER

01:38:44.918 --> 01:38:47.021
OF UNITS BUILT MY FRIENDS IF

01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:49.456
YOU PASS THIS MEASURE AB

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:50.724
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL ONLY

01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:52.693
DECREASE IF RENT CONTROL IS

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.428
ENACTED WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:56.697
CALIFORNIA WE'LL SEE EVEN A

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:58.065
GREATER HOUSING CRISIS BECAUSE

01:38:58.132 --> 01:38:59.700
OF THE LOW SUPPLY OF HOUSING

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:01.001
EITHER THIS WILL FORCE OUR

01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:03.937
CONSTITUENTS TO JOIN SIXTY

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:06.106
THOUSAND HOMELESS POPULATION

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:08.242
THAT WE SEE IN THE LA AREA

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:08.876
ALTHOUGH SIMPLY JUST MOVE TO

01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:11.378
ANOTHER STATE. IF WE REALLY

01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:11.945
WANT TO SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:14.548
HOUSING CRISIS AND PROTECT

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:16.684
EXISTING AND FUTURE TENANTS WE

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:18.485
MUST PASS LEGISLATION THAT

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:20.854
ENCOURAGES HOUSING INVESTMENT

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.523
AND PROVIDES HOUSING CHOICE BY

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:24.958
REMOVING BARRIERS SO THAT

01:39:25.025 --> 01:39:28.395
DEVELOPERS CAN BUY LAND AND CAN

01:39:28.462 --> 01:39:29.563
BUILD AND STOP OVER IMPORTING

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:30.898
THEM WITH INTEREST RATES PLACE

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:32.466
SINCE THAT TRANSLATE INTO

01:39:32.533 --> 01:39:36.070
HIGHER COSTS THAT HAVE TO BE

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:40.107
PASSED ON. TO RENTERS. AB

01:39:40.174 --> 01:39:40.641
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WOULD

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:41.275
DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT HOUSING.

01:39:41.342 --> 01:39:44.078
SLOW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. AND

01:39:44.144 --> 01:39:44.678
LIMIT TENANTS ABILITY TO FIND

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:53.253
HOMES. MY FRIENDS. I KNOW IT.

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.756
GOOD TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:57.391
YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE RENTERS

01:39:57.458 --> 01:39:57.991
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE

01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:01.395
ALL DO. BUT THERE'S A RIGHT WAY

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:02.896
TO DO IT IN A WRONG WAY TO DO

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:04.698
IT LIMITING THE SUPPLY AND

01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:07.167
LIMITED THE INVESTMENT IN

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:07.768
PROVIDING THE SAME IS NOT THE

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:09.703
RIGHT APPROACH. WE LEARNED THAT

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:13.173
IN THE NEXT ONE ONE. I CAN TELL

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.575
YOU I'VE BEEN A PROUD INVESTOR

01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:15.175
IN REAL ESTATE FOR THIRTY FIVE

01:40:15.242 --> 01:40:19.146
YEARS. I PREPARED FOR THIS

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:19.713
MOMENT I'M GOOD I'M IN GOOD

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:22.449
SHAPE. MANY OF MY FAMILY.

01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:23.751
MEMBERS HAVE PREPARED FOR THIS

01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:26.153
MOMENT THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.221
BUT THERE ARE MANY IN

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:29.156
CALIFORNIA THE WEREN'T AWARE.

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:31.325
THAT THIS TRAIN WAS GOING TO BE

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:33.360
LEAVING THE STATION HEARD IN

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:35.662
THEIR ABILITY TO. ENJOY THEIR

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:38.065
INVESTMENTS ESPECIALLY ARE

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:39.199
RETIRED FOLKS THAT WORK THEIR

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:42.202
ENTIRE LIVES. TO BUILD A LITTLE

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:43.771
BIT OF SAVINGS TO BUY A FEW

01:40:43.837 --> 01:40:46.240
DWELLING UNITS SO THAT THEY CAN

01:40:46.306 --> 01:40:46.774
LIVE A COMFORTABLE LIFE IN

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:49.076
THEIR RETIREMENT. THEY STILL

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:50.544
HAVE TO MAINTAIN THESE UNITS

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:52.546
THAT ARE OLDER. THE PLUMBING

01:40:52.613 --> 01:40:54.515
GOES OUT THE AIR CONDITIONING

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:56.517
GOES OUT THE HEATING GOES OUT.

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:58.018
THESE THESE EXPENDITURES ARE

01:40:58.085 --> 01:40:59.620
NOT CHEAP THEY'RE EXPENSIVE

01:40:59.686 --> 01:41:02.456
ESPECIALLY WITH OLDER UNITS. SO

01:41:02.523 --> 01:41:04.491
IF YOU HAVE A CAP OF 5% ON A

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:05.993
UNIT IS THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS

01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:07.861
OLD MY UNCLE OWNS SOME UNITS IN

01:41:07.928 --> 01:41:08.796
GLENDALE CALIFORNIA THE

01:41:08.862 --> 01:41:10.664
PROBABLY FIFTY YEARS OLD. YOU

01:41:10.731 --> 01:41:11.999
KNOW IT'S ALMOST TIME YOU HAVE

01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:13.534
TO KIND OF REBUILD THESE UNITS

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.803
AGAIN TO MAKE THEM HAPPY DOUBLE

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:16.770
SO THE PEOPLE CAN ENJOY THEIR

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:19.740
HOMES BUT THAT COSTS MONEY WELL

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:21.074
IF THEY CAN'T GET A RETURN ON

01:41:21.141 --> 01:41:22.409
THEIR INVESTMENT DO YOU REALLY

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:23.877
BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO VESTED

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:25.512
THESE UNITS AND MAKE THEM MY

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:26.980
SON HABITABLE. I THINK THE

01:41:27.047 --> 01:41:29.149
ANSWER IS NO WE'RE GOING TO

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:30.617
CREATE SUB STANDARD LIVING

01:41:30.684 --> 01:41:32.519
CONDITIONS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:36.523
LIVING AT THE BORDERLINE OF

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:37.124
BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE STATE

01:41:37.191 --> 01:41:40.160
OF CALIFORNIA. THIS HOUSING

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:42.596
CRISIS IT IS VERY MUCH.

01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:44.298
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLICIES

01:41:44.364 --> 01:41:45.065
THE COME OUT OF THIS

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:47.134
INSTITUTION. WE CAN DO A LOT

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:48.869
BETTER JOB OF REDUCING COSTS.

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.971
AND THAT'S HAVE COMPETITION.

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:52.806
AMONGST LANDLORDS THERE'S NO

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:53.874
NOT MUCH COMPETITION NOW

01:41:53.941 --> 01:41:56.043
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T. MADE IT.

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:58.111
EASY FOR PEOPLE TO BUILD MULTI

01:41:58.178 --> 01:41:59.580
FAMILY DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:01.615
OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T HAVE

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:02.983
COMPETITION. THIS IS WHAT THE

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:05.018
RESULT IS. AND SO WHAT'S THE

01:42:05.085 --> 01:42:06.887
GOVERNMENT SOLUTION. LET'S JUST

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:07.421
CAP THE INCOME THAT THESE

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:09.456
ENTREPRENEURS ARE ENTITLED TO

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:11.458
MAKE. IT THE WRONG WAY TO DO IT

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:12.993
YOU NEED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:13.894
SOMETHING WE'VE ALL TALKED

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:15.963
ABOUT. AND WHEN YOU INCREASES

01:42:16.029 --> 01:42:18.365
APPLY. MANY OF THESE LANDLORDS

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:21.335
ARE GOING TO COMPETE. AND

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:22.302
THEY'RE GOING TO COMPETE IN A

01:42:22.369 --> 01:42:24.638
ROW WHY IS HEY AND THAT'S HOW I

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:26.874
GOT A LOWER RENTS. AND THAT'S

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:27.708
HOW YOU'RE GONNA MAKE.

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:31.311
PROPERTIES AWFUL WE HAVE A BILL

01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:31.945
DO WILLING IS FOR PEOPLE TO GET

01:42:32.012 --> 01:42:35.516
BY. MY FRIENDS THESE ARE THE

01:42:35.582 --> 01:42:37.050
REASONS WHY WE DO THIS NOTE AB

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:37.618
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IT FEELS

01:42:37.684 --> 01:42:39.052
GOOD. BUT IT'S GOING TO HER A

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:39.620
LOT OF PEOPLE THE STATE OF

01:42:39.686 --> 01:42:40.187
CALIFORNIA IF YOU PASS THIS

01:42:40.254 --> 01:42:41.588
ORIGINAL VOTED AB FOURTEEN

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:42.155
EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU SENATOR

01:42:42.222 --> 01:42:49.663
GLAZER. THANK YOU MADAM

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:53.800
PRESIDENT MEMBERS. AS IT HAS

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:54.401
BEEN SAID BY NUMBERS SPEAKERS

01:42:54.468 --> 01:42:57.471
EARLIER. A SEVERE SHOULD

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:58.438
SHORTAGE OF HOUSING AND

01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:00.841
CALIFORNIA'S IS CAUSING RENTS

01:43:00.908 --> 01:43:03.277
TO RISE TO LEVELS THAT ARE NO

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:03.877
LONGER AFFORDABLE FOR A LARGE

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:05.946
SHARE OF OUR POPULATION. HI

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:07.247
THIS BILL PROMISES TO SLOW

01:43:07.314 --> 01:43:09.583
THOSE INCREASES AND PREVENT ON

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:12.653
JUST ADDICTIONS. BUT IN MY VIEW

01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:14.421
RENT CONTROL IS NOT THE ANSWER

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:17.024
TO OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE. WHILE

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:17.491
IT MAY BE NEEDED IN AN

01:43:17.558 --> 01:43:19.927
EMERGENCY. IT MIGHT MAKE THINGS

01:43:19.993 --> 01:43:22.696
WORSE OVER THE LONG RUN. RED

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:24.331
CONTROL ALMOST BY DEFINITION

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:26.099
MAKES THE THINGS WE NEED MOST

01:43:26.166 --> 01:43:27.434
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW RENTAL

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:29.503
HOUSING LESS LIKELY. AND IT

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:33.440
WOULD OTHERWISE BE. ANYTIME YOU

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:34.641
REDUCE THE RATE OF RETURN ON

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:36.043
INVESTMENT YOU MAKE THAT

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:39.046
INVESTMENT LESS ATTRACTIVE. AND

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:40.814
THIS IS TRUE EVEN IF NEW

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:42.950
INVESTMENT IS ACCEPTED FOR

01:43:43.016 --> 01:43:43.517
FIFTEEN YEARS HAS THIS BILL

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:47.521
DOES. RED CAN WROTECONTROL CAN

01:43:47.588 --> 01:43:48.288
LEAD TO THE REDUCTION IN THE

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:51.491
EXISTING RENTAL SUPPLY. A TWO

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:52.059
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY BY

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:53.060
STANFORD BUSINESS SCHOOL FOUND

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:55.228
THAT AFTER. SAN FRANCISCO

01:43:55.295 --> 01:43:56.597
ADOPTED RENT CONTROL IN

01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:58.899
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. LANDLORDS

01:43:58.966 --> 01:43:59.600
ARE MORE LIKELY TO CONVERT

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:02.869
THEIR APARTMENTS TWO CONDOS. OR

01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:03.570
NOT IS THERE TENANTS OUT BY

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.272
SPENDING LESS ON MAINTENANCE.

01:44:05.339 --> 01:44:07.474
OTHERS MOVED INTO THE RENTAL

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:08.075
UNITS THEMSELVES ARE RENTED TO

01:44:08.141 --> 01:44:11.011
FAMILY MEMBERS. AND AT A TIME

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.479
WHEN WE SHOULD BE TARGETING OUR

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:14.781
SOLUTIONS TO THOSE MOST IN NEED.

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.416
CONTROL HELPS THE MILLIONAIRE

01:44:16.483 --> 01:44:17.751
AND A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR A

01:44:17.818 --> 01:44:20.587
MONTH UNIT EVEN MORE THAN IT

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:22.289
HELPS THE SINGLE MOM. AND A

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:22.856
NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR. A MONTH

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:27.227
FLAT. A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO

01:44:27.294 --> 01:44:29.696
HELP POOR RANCHERS. IN A WAY

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:32.599
THAT DOES NOT REDUCE SUPPLY. IS

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.801
TO GIVE THOSE RENTERS GRANTS OR

01:44:34.868 --> 01:44:36.503
TAX CREDITS TO HELP THEM PAY

01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:38.472
THE RENT. WE DO THIS IN

01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:40.807
HEALTHCARE. AND WE DO THIS WITH

01:44:40.874 --> 01:44:44.244
FOOD. WE SHOULD DO MORE OF IT

01:44:44.311 --> 01:44:48.582
WITH HOUSING. THE SENATE HAS

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:51.084
PASSED MY LEGISLATION TO CATCH

01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:52.085
THE RENTER'S CREDIT UP TO

01:44:52.152 --> 01:44:55.088
INFLATION AFTER HOLDEN FLAT FOR

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:55.656
FORTY YEARS I THANK YOU FOR

01:44:55.722 --> 01:44:59.660
THAT. AND THAT MEASURE ALSO

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:01.762
INCREASE THE CREDIT FOR. LOW

01:45:01.828 --> 01:45:04.531
INCOME SINGLE MOMS AND DADS.

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:06.633
THAT BIPARTISAN IDEAS SHOULD BE

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.200
A PART OF ANY PLANNED EIGHT

01:45:07.267 --> 01:45:10.103
RENTERS. BUT THAT BILL WAS HELD

01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:10.704
IN THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS

01:45:10.771 --> 01:45:13.974
COMMITTEE. I HOPE WE CAN

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:14.608
REVISIT THIS WERE THE PLAN NEXT

01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:18.645
YEAR. THE ASSEMBLY ALSO BLOCKED

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:21.014
COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION TO GIVE

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:21.581
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE SAME

01:45:21.648 --> 01:45:24.251
RELIEF FROM SYKORA. FROM SEQUEL

01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:25.318
LITIGATION THAT THIS

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:27.087
LEGISLATURE'S GIVEN THE

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:27.721
BUILDERS OF SPORTS STADIUMS AND

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:32.292
ARENAS. SO WHILE RENT CAPS IN

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:33.193
THIS BILL MAY PROVIDE SOME

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.495
SHORT TERM RELIEF TO THOSE WHO

01:45:35.562 --> 01:45:37.597
HAVE A RENTAL UNIT TODAY. WE

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:39.032
MUST DO MORE TO HELP LOW INCOME

01:45:39.099 --> 01:45:41.435
RENTERS AND THAT MEANS

01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:42.269
INCREASING THE SUPPLY

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:44.404
INCREASING THE SUPPLY THE RENT

01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:45.939
IS NOT JUST CAPITA COMES DOWN

01:45:46.006 --> 01:45:48.141
OVER TIME AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR

01:45:48.208 --> 01:45:49.176
OF THIS LEGISLATION UNDERSTANDS

01:45:49.242 --> 01:45:51.378
THAT AND AGREES WITH THAT THAT

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:54.181
DESIRE TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY.

01:45:54.247 --> 01:45:54.781
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE FACTOID IN

01:45:54.848 --> 01:45:59.786
A CLOSE. ACCORDING TO THE-

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:01.354
CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC FORUM THERE

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:03.190
ARE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:03.724
APPROVED HOUSING UNITS IN

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:06.927
CALIFORNIA TODAY. THAT'S RIGHT

01:46:06.993 --> 01:46:08.795
FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

01:46:08.862 --> 01:46:09.863
APPROVED HOUSING UNITS IN

01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:12.699
CALIFORNIA TODAY WITH THE

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:13.266
ROBUST CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:13.834
THAT'S PROBABLY A THREE YEAR

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:16.303
SUPPLY. AND SO YOU HAVE TO ASK

01:46:16.369 --> 01:46:18.338
YOURSELF SO WHAT WHAT'S

01:46:18.405 --> 01:46:18.939
HAPPENING HERE WHY WHY AREN'T

01:46:19.005 --> 01:46:23.543
PEOPLE BUILDING. RENTS ARE

01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:25.312
GOING OUT PEOPLE MAKING MONEY

01:46:25.378 --> 01:46:27.414
ALLEGEDLY. SO WHY ARE WE ABLE

01:46:27.481 --> 01:46:29.116
TO BORROW WHY ISN'T THAT.

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:30.484
CAPITAL BEING INVESTED IN

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:33.453
CONSTRUCTION AND WE ALL KNOW

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:34.087
THAT THE COMPLEX ANSWER TO THAT

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:37.958
QUESTION. WHETHER IT'S FEES.

01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:40.193
WHETHER IT'S AVAILABILITY OF

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:42.262
SUPPLIES AND COST OF LABOR

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:44.731
THERE'S A LOT TO THAT AND IT'S

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:45.365
COMPLEX AND WE ALL KNOW WE NEED

01:46:45.432 --> 01:46:47.601
TO WORK ON IT. IT HAS LITTLE TO

01:46:47.667 --> 01:46:50.670
DO. WITH NIMBY ISM THAT SAYING

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:53.874
NO TO CONSTRUCTION AS WE DEBATE

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:56.777
A LOT ON THE FLOOR IN THAT AREA.

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:58.512
NEVER THE LESS THE ACUTE

01:46:58.578 --> 01:46:59.546
CONSEQUENCES OF THESE LARGE

01:46:59.613 --> 01:47:02.649
RENT INCREASES. IS A CRISIS

01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:05.919
THAT WE CAN'T IGNORE. ALTHOUGH

01:47:05.986 --> 01:47:07.788
FLAWED AND SHORT TERM IN ITS

01:47:07.854 --> 01:47:10.190
BENEFITS THIS BILL. PUTS A

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.892
TEMPORARY BANDAID AGAINST RENT

01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:15.595
GALGIANI. AND ACCORDINGLY I'LL

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:20.267
BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. THANK

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:41.087
ARTICULATED VERY IMPORTANT

01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:42.522
THINGS ABOUT THIS IS A

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:44.324
VIOLATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS

YOU KNOW PERSON WORKS WATSON

01:47:45.992 --> 01:47:47.727
TOILS AND THEY MAKE A LITTLE

01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:49.296
MONEY THEN THEY INVEST IN AN

01:47:49.362 --> 01:47:50.664
APARTMENT BUILDING IN OUR HOUSE

01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:52.866

BUSINESS RENTAL HOUSING AND.

01:48:32.005 --> 01:48:32.539
THE ARK SKIPPING MANY OF THEM

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:35.675
WERE VERY CONCERNED. PLACE LONG

01:48:35.742 --> 01:48:36.476
TERM INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:48:36.543 --> 01:48:37.344
BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATION AND

01:48:37.410 --> 01:48:38.144
SELL. MANY OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:39.346
HAVE LEFT CALIFORNIA'S. MY

01:48:39.412 --> 01:48:41.081
FRIEND FROM RIVERSIDE AS WELL

01:48:41.147 --> 01:48:43.149
AS I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY MORE WHO

01:48:43.216 --> 01:48:44.384
ARE CONSIDERING DOING THE SAME

01:48:44.451 --> 01:48:46.753
THING. BECAUSE HOW DO YOU HOW

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:49.489
DO YOU MAKE A GOOD INVESTMENT.

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:51.057
IN CALIFORNIA ON OUR PART AND

01:48:51.124 --> 01:48:52.292
BILLING RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU HAVE

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:54.227
RENT CONTROL IN AND ONE OF THE

01:48:54.294 --> 01:48:55.896
THINGS THAT THAT DEBTS THIS

01:48:55.962 --> 01:48:58.465
REALLY TOUGH. IS REPAIRS AND

01:48:58.531 --> 01:48:59.733
CITIES LIKE DETROIT WHERE YOU

01:48:59.799 --> 01:49:02.636
DO HAVE STRICT RENT CONTROL

01:49:02.702 --> 01:49:03.536
THERE'S THIRTY NINE THOUSAND

01:49:03.603 --> 01:49:04.504
VACANT HOMES FROM WHAT I

01:49:04.571 --> 01:49:06.106
UNDERSTAND. IN THE CITY OF

01:49:06.172 --> 01:49:08.241
DETROIT WE DON'T WANT TO BECOME

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:09.843
LIKE TROY BUT SADLY PERHAPS WE

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:12.212
WILL BECAUSE- FOR LANDLORDS

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:13.013
MAKE A RETURN ON YOUR

01:49:13.079 --> 01:49:14.915
INVESTMENT. IT'S VERY TOUGH

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:16.783
WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY. HOUSING

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:18.451
REPAIR SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:20.420
AWAY WITH MINOR THINGS BUT WHEN

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:21.321
THAT AIR CONDITIONING HEATING

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:23.490
BREAKS THEY COULD BE FIVE TO

01:49:23.556 --> 01:49:24.357
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN CIVIL

01:49:24.424 --> 01:49:27.260
WITH RENT CONTROL QUITE OFTEN

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:30.597
YOU SEE THAT THEIR CONDITIONS

01:49:30.664 --> 01:49:33.066
OF THE PROPERTY WELL CERTAINLY.

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:35.769
AND SO AGAIN I THINK. I AM THE

01:49:35.835 --> 01:49:36.603
FREE MARKET SHOULD ROLL IT WAS

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:38.371
MENTIONED THAT THE VOTERS VOTED

01:49:38.438 --> 01:49:41.074
OVERWHELMINGLY TO PROTECT

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:43.343
HOUSING HAND WE SHOULD DO WHAT

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:45.712
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE VOTED ON

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:47.948
AND SO FOR THAT REASON I AM A

01:49:48.014 --> 01:49:51.084
NO BUT BUT THE LONG TERM

01:49:51.151 --> 01:49:53.353
THINKING IS THIS WILL BE IF

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.288
HISTORY IS ANY INDICATION

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:56.923
MODERN HISTORY THIS WILL BE

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:59.159
DEVASTATING TO OUR- OUR OUR

01:49:59.225 --> 01:50:01.361

01:50:01.428 --> 01:50:03.830
FEWER. PIECES OF PROPERTY BUT

01:50:03.897 --> 01:50:06.333
ALSO WILL HAVE CITIES THAT WILL

01:50:06.399 --> 01:50:09.235
DETERIORATE BECAUSE OF THE

01:50:09.302 --> 01:50:09.803
EXPENSE THAT COMES WITH RENT

01:50:09.869 --> 01:50:12.038
CONTROL AND YOU WON'T HAVE.

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:14.040
THAT MANY INVESTORS WHO ARE

DISCUSSION WITH. THE POINT SAID

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:54.441
IN PREVIOUSLY RAISED BUT IT

01:51:54.507 --> 01:52:00.613
OCCURRED TO ME. THAT. ALL OF US

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.181
APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE IN A

01:52:01.247 --> 01:52:04.050
HOUSING EMERGENCY. I DON'T

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:05.585
THINK ANYBODY THINKS THAT WERE

01:52:05.652 --> 01:52:07.387
NOT. WE'VE HEARD IT FROM THE

01:52:07.454 --> 01:52:09.322
GOVERNOR WE DISCUSSED AD

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:12.592
NAUSEAM A NUMBER OF ITEMS IT IN

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:15.728
IN THE MEDIA THAT CALIFORNIA IS

01:52:15.795 --> 01:52:18.898
JUST NOT. OF IT IS NOT GOING TO

01:52:18.965 --> 01:52:21.067
BE ABLE TO SATISFY ITS PRESENT

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:22.302
HOUSING NEEDS AND CERTAINLY NOT

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:24.571
ITS FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS. WITH

01:52:24.637 --> 01:52:25.171
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING RIGHT

01:52:25.238 --> 01:52:29.109
NOW. AND I'VE GOING BACK TO MY

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:33.213
LAW SCHOOL. EXPERIENCE THERE

01:52:33.279 --> 01:52:35.381
ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT HAPPEN

01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:38.184
IN EVENTS LIKE EMERGENCIES. YOU

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:39.919
KNOW WHETHER IT'S HABEAS CORPUS

01:52:39.986 --> 01:52:45.291
OR. WE HAVE MARTIAL LAW FOR.

01:52:45.358 --> 01:52:46.960
EMERGENCY NATURAL DISASTER

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:49.129
DECLARATIONS THESE ARE ALL

01:52:49.195 --> 01:52:51.965
IDENTIFIED AS TEMPORARY BUT

01:52:52.031 --> 01:52:55.502
IMPORTANT GESTURES TO ACHIEVE

01:52:55.568 --> 01:52:56.035
STABILITY FOR SECURITY OR

01:52:56.102 --> 01:52:59.272
SAFETY. AND I THINK IF SINCE WE

01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:01.141
ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN A

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:04.344
HOUSING EMERGENCY. I WOULD

01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:07.714
SIMPLY ASK THAT MAYBE IT WOULD

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:09.816
BE MORE PRUDENT IF THIS

01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:13.753
LEGISLATION. HAD SOME SAFETY

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:14.387
VALVES IN IT MORE SO THAN EXIST

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:17.790
RIGHT NOW. IN ONE OF THEM WOULD

01:53:17.857 --> 01:53:20.426
BE IN A TEN YEAR WINDOW FOR

01:53:20.493 --> 01:53:23.129
SOMETHING THAT I THINK

01:53:23.196 --> 01:53:25.798
ECONOMISTS AND FOLKS IN THE

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:28.334
INDUSTRY HAVE AMPLE DEBATE ON.

01:53:28.401 --> 01:53:31.538
MAY PERHAPS A FIVE YEAR WINDOW

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:34.174
INSTEAD OF ITS CURRENT

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:36.643
EXPLORATION AT TWENTY THIRTY.

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:38.878
HOW ABOUT AN ANNUAL REVIEW ON

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:40.480
WHERE OUR HOUSING STOCK IS

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:42.182
GOING AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT

01:53:42.248 --> 01:53:44.551
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:47.654
ACTUALLY GAINING TRACTION. IN

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.088
ACHIEVING THE OUTCOMES THAT WE

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:51.024
HAVE TALKED ABOUT NEEDING SO

01:53:51.090 --> 01:53:53.593
DESPERATELY IN OUR STATE. I

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.395
THINK THAT COULD MAKE SOMETHING

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:57.397
LIKE THIS EVEN THOUGH I'M-

01:53:57.463 --> 01:53:58.565
PHILOSOPHICALLY AND

01:53:58.631 --> 01:53:59.799
ECONOMICALLY OF THE OPINION

01:53:59.866 --> 01:54:02.635
THAT RENT CONTROL IS NOT GOING

01:54:02.702 --> 01:54:04.837
TO GIVE US WHAT WE NEED. I

01:54:04.904 --> 01:54:06.906
THINK WE KNOW THAT THE VOTE

01:54:06.973 --> 01:54:09.342
COUNT IN THE POLITICAL SUPPORT

01:54:09.409 --> 01:54:12.412
WILL BRING THIS TO REALITY. BUT

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:14.747
PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MADE BETTER

01:54:14.814 --> 01:54:16.282
FOR AT LEAST MORE ACCOUNTABLE

01:54:16.349 --> 01:54:18.851
IF WE HAD SOME SAFETY VALVES

01:54:18.918 --> 01:54:20.119
INCORPORATED INTO THIS MORE

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:22.155
THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW. I CAN

01:54:22.222 --> 01:54:23.723
ONLY OFFER THAT IS A RESPECTFUL

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:25.758
RECOMMENDATION BUT JUST TO

01:54:25.825 --> 01:54:27.860
REITERATE. INSTEAD OF IT BEING

01:54:27.927 --> 01:54:30.129
AT TWENTY THIRTY MAKE IT FIVE

01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:33.666
YEARS. AND REQUIRE. EXPERTS

01:54:33.733 --> 01:54:36.603
WITHIN. THE RELEVANT FIELD TO

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:38.404
REPORT BACK TO US ON WHETHER OR

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:42.308
pTO THE WE DON'T LET TOO MUCH

01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:43.776
TIME EXPIRE BEFORE RE

01:54:43.843 --> 01:54:48.815
CORRECTING THE COURSE. THANK

01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:53.453
YOU SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU

01:54:53.519 --> 01:54:56.422
MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS BAND

01:54:56.489 --> 01:54:57.590
THESE ARE THE TYPE OF DEBATES I

01:54:57.657 --> 01:54:59.726
THINKER I'VE RATHER WE DON'T

01:54:59.792 --> 01:55:00.927
DEBATE THIS IS THE TYPE OF

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:03.363
DISCUSSIONS THAT I THINK ARE

01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:06.099
VERY VALUABLE ON OUR FLOOR. AND

01:55:06.165 --> 01:55:08.735
I NOTE THAT IT WAS EITHER TODAY

01:55:08.801 --> 01:55:10.036
OR MAYBE POSTED YESTERDAY

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:12.705
ONLINE THE SACRAMENTO BEE ONCE

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:14.240
AGAIN REPORTED THAT

CALIFORNIA'S POVERTY RATE

ACCORDING TO NEW CENSUS BUREAU

01:55:19.279 --> 01:55:20.847
DATA IS THE HIGHEST IN THE

01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:23.149
NATION. AND WHEN YOU ACCOUNT

01:55:23.216 --> 01:55:25.618
FOR COST OF LIVING. OUR POVERTY

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:27.320
RATE IS ONLY EXCEEDED BY

01:55:27.387 --> 01:55:33.860
WASHINGTON DC. WE ARE IN THE

01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:36.129
HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE ARE IN

01:55:36.195 --> 01:55:36.729
BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BUILT IN A

01:55:36.796 --> 01:55:41.334
FALLACY. AND I KNOW THAT MANY

01:55:41.401 --> 01:55:44.671
OF YOU AND I HAVE BEEN DOING

01:55:44.737 --> 01:55:49.208
OUR BEST TO. FULLY GIVE A GREEN

01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:53.146
LIGHT TO GET MUCH MORE HOUSING

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:55.615
AND TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT

01:55:55.682 --> 01:55:57.317
FOR NOW DECADES WE DID NOT

01:55:57.383 --> 01:55:59.886
BUILD ENOUGH BUT WE CAN NOT

01:55:59.952 --> 01:56:02.155
BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS

01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:04.657
CRISIS FAST ENOUGH. AND

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:08.995
MEANWHILE WE HAVE MORE IN MORE.

DISPLACED FROM THEIR RESIDENTS.

01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:24.644
IN MY DISTRICT ALONE. AND I

01:56:24.711 --> 01:56:26.612
USUALLY BUY PREVIOUSLY IN

ACCURATELY SAID THERE WAS A 47%

01:56:29.782 --> 01:56:31.684
INCREASE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:35.888

TEN YEARS OF TEMPORARY RELIEF

HOMELESS AND TO GIVE US THE

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:01.974
OPPORTUNITY TO STEM THIS TIDE

01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:04.343

01:58:04.977 --> 01:58:06.212
ASKED ZERO VOTE. THANK YOU

01:58:06.279 --> 01:58:10.583
SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:13.352
MADAM PRESIDENT THANKS FOR THE

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:13.920
VALUABLE DISCUSSION ON THIS

01:58:13.986 --> 01:58:16.522
TOPIC. FOR ME MISDIAGNOSIS IS

01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:22.061
TOUGH. TO OBSERVE AND WATCH SO.

01:58:22.128 --> 01:58:22.562
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE

01:58:22.628 --> 01:58:24.831
TEMPORARY HOUSING SHORTAGE.

01:58:24.897 --> 01:58:26.632
COLLEAGUES THAT THE TWO WORDS

01:58:26.699 --> 01:58:29.502
RENT CONTROL FOR ME IS LIKE

01:58:29.569 --> 01:58:30.069
FINGERNAILS SCRATCHING ON A

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:34.040
BLACKBOARD. BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT

01:58:34.106 --> 01:58:37.310
THAT A 5% ANNUAL INCREASE PLUS

01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:40.313
CPI AS A CAP IS VERY VERY

01:58:40.379 --> 01:58:42.548
GENEROUS ESPECIALLY WHEN REPORT

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:44.684
TENSION LATE AT THE TOP. OF A

01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:48.988
MARKET WAY TO GO. SO WHAT DO

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:49.922
YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE AN

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:51.924
AGREEMENT THAT MAKES SO MUCH

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:54.427
SENSE. HOW DO YOU PASS IT UP.

01:58:54.494 --> 01:58:59.499
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. BUT IF IT

01:58:59.565 --> 01:59:01.934
THIS INCENTIVIZE IS THE

01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:03.769
CREATION OF MORE NEW HOUSING

01:59:03.836 --> 01:59:07.373
WERE TOAST. MISDIAGNOSIS COULD

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.878
BE. HAPPENING HERE AS A FREE

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:13.646
MARKET PERSON THERE'S A LOT OF

01:59:13.713 --> 01:59:15.848
REASONS FOR THE PROBLEM WE

01:59:15.915 --> 01:59:16.382
KNOW. BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:20.152
POPULATION TRENDS. RECESSION

01:59:20.219 --> 01:59:20.653
ECONOMIC CYCLES AND THEN

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:23.422
POTENTIALLY OVER BUILDING. AND

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:24.790
THOSE ARE THE WAYS THAT WE

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:27.660
CORRECT HOUSING DEMAND SO

01:59:27.727 --> 01:59:36.168
COLLEAGUES PATIENCE PATIENCE.

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:38.838
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT UP

01:59:38.905 --> 01:59:41.574
SENATOR LABEL. THANK YOU MADAM

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:45.244
PRESIDENT. MEMBERS WE CAN'T

01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:47.914
HAVE IT BOTH WAYS WE CANNOT AS

01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:50.616
A STATE AND AS A COUNTRY NOT

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.618
HOLD CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE

01:59:52.685 --> 01:59:55.454
FOR THE LOW POVERTY WAGES THAT

01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:58.858
THEY PAY WORKERS AND THEN SAY

01:59:58.925 --> 02:00:00.860
THAT THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT

02:00:00.927 --> 02:00:02.795
THAT THAT WEEK WE SHOULDN'T

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:05.765
SOLVE. THE RENT PROBLEM. UNTIL

02:00:05.831 --> 02:00:08.034
WE DECIDE THAT WORKERS DESERVE

02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:10.336
A LIVING WAGE UNTIL WE DOES

02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:12.471
DECIDE THAT CORPORATIONS WHO

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:14.006
MAKE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF

02:00:14.073 --> 02:00:15.441
DOLLARS SHOULD SHARE SOME OF

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:17.410
THAT WITH THE WORKERS WHO PUSH

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.412
THE MONEY UP TO THEM. THIS IS

02:00:19.478 --> 02:00:20.713
GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:22.281
PROBLEM DO WE HAVE A HOUSING

02:00:22.348 --> 02:00:23.149
SHORTAGE OF COURSE WE HAVE HAD

02:00:23.215 --> 02:00:25.451
A HOUSING SHORTAGE. THAT WE

02:00:25.518 --> 02:00:27.820
KNOW HOW TO FIX BUT HOW DO WE

02:00:27.887 --> 02:00:30.189
FIX THE RENT AND HOW DO WE FIX.

02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:32.191
THAT PEOPLE CAN'T PAY THE RENT

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:33.726
ONE OF THE WAYS IS THROUGH

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.761
WAGES BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO

02:00:35.828 --> 02:00:37.563
THAT WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT WE

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:39.298
ALLOW CORPORATIONS WHO HOLD

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:41.233
MORE WEALTH THAN THEY'VE EVER

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.835
HELD IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

02:00:42.902 --> 02:00:44.170
COUNTRY. TO CONTINUE TO BE

02:00:44.236 --> 02:00:46.405
GREEDY UNTIL WE HOLD THEM

02:00:46.472 --> 02:00:48.040
ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE THEM FORCE

02:00:48.107 --> 02:00:49.775
THEM TO PAY LIVING WAGES THIS

02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:51.243
IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A

02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:54.080
PROBLEM. I'VE TOLD THIS STORY

02:00:54.146 --> 02:00:54.680
BEFORE BUT I'M GONNA TELL IT

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.349
AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK IT BEARS

02:00:56.415 --> 02:00:56.983
REPEATING AND IT'S ONE OF THE

02:00:57.049 --> 02:00:59.685
REASONS I RAN FOR OFFICE. IN

02:00:59.752 --> 02:01:00.219
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHEN

02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:01.687
MYSELF AND MY HUSBAND GOT

02:01:01.754 --> 02:01:03.589
MARRIED WE MADE TWELVE DOLLARS

02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:05.257
AN HOUR IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:05.992
EIGHT DO YOU KNOW PEOPLE RIGHT

02:01:06.058 --> 02:01:07.893
NOW THAT BARELY MAKE THAT AND

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:08.894
THE ONLY REASON THEY DO IS

02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:11.030
BECAUSE WE RAISE THE MINIMUM

02:01:11.097 --> 02:01:13.733
WAGE WE HAVE THE LEGISLATURE

02:01:13.799 --> 02:01:15.668
HAD TO DO IT BECAUSE

02:01:15.735 --> 02:01:18.604
CORPORATIONS WOULDN'T DO THE

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:19.839
RIGHT THING. WE MADE TWELVE

02:01:19.905 --> 02:01:23.075
DOLLARS AN HOUR WE BOUGHT A

02:01:23.142 --> 02:01:28.881
HOUSE. THIS WAS. NINE NINE. IN

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:31.150
DOLLARS EIGHT TOURISTS THE TWO.

02:01:31.217 --> 02:01:31.984
AS AN GAS WAS NINETY TWO CENTS

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:33.386
A GALLON FAST OVER THIRTY YEARS

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.286
THAT HOUSE IS WORTH FOUR

02:01:34.353 --> 02:01:34.787
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:01:34.854 --> 02:01:35.388
RELEASE IS SELLING FOR FOUR

02:01:35.454 --> 02:01:35.921
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS I

02:01:35.988 --> 02:01:36.555
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH FOUR

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:37.189
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS GAS IS

02:01:37.256 --> 02:01:37.790
ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS A GALLON

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:39.558
EXIT THREE TO SIX DOLLARS A

02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:41.360
DOZEN WHAT SHOULD THAT GROCERY

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:42.928
CLERK THAT WAS MAKING TWELVE

02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:44.363
DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:47.066
EIGHT BE MAKING IF IT'S GOING

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:47.633
TO KEEP UP WITH. EVERYTHING

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.069
ELSE THAT'S GONE UP AROUND THEM.

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:51.237
FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR TO ME FOR

02:01:51.303 --> 02:01:52.104
EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR WHAT DOES

02:01:52.171 --> 02:01:54.640
THAT GROCERY WORKER MAKE TODAY.

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:55.908
TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AN HOUR IF

02:01:55.975 --> 02:01:57.643
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LET

02:01:57.710 --> 02:01:59.078
EVERYTHING RISE AROUND US

02:01:59.145 --> 02:02:01.180
EXCEPT REAL WAGES. WE ARE NEVER

02:02:01.247 --> 02:02:02.548
GOING TO FIX THE ROOT OF THE

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:05.017
PROBLEM. BUT I THINK THE

02:02:05.084 --> 02:02:07.019
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO GOES A LONG

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:07.586
WAY AND PEOPLE WHO NEED OUR

02:02:07.653 --> 02:02:11.357
HELP. THINGS COME TO THIS

02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:13.726
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE OUTSIDE OF

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:15.728
THIS BUILDING. PEOPLE DON'T DO

02:02:15.795 --> 02:02:17.163
THE RIGHT THING AND WERE FORCED

02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:18.664
TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO I'M

02:02:18.731 --> 02:02:20.366
HAPPY TO STAND IN STRONG

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:23.102
SUPPORT. OF FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:25.504
AND DO A LITTLE PART. ARE PART

02:02:25.571 --> 02:02:27.406
IN HELPING PEOPLE REMAIN IN

02:02:27.473 --> 02:02:28.841
THEIR APARTMENT. IN THEIR

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:31.310
RENTAL HOME. WE CAN'T SEE MORE

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:32.812
PEOPLE ON THE STREET WE CAN'T

02:02:32.878 --> 02:02:34.113
WE CAN'T BE CONSIDERING

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.015
LEGISLATION TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO

02:02:36.082 --> 02:02:38.250
SLEEP IN THEIR CARS. ISN'T THAT

02:02:38.317 --> 02:02:39.752
AWFUL THAT WERE THINKING ABOUT

02:02:39.819 --> 02:02:42.888
THAT. SO UNTIL WE DECIDE THAT

02:02:42.955 --> 02:02:44.457
WE WANT OF WORLD CORPORATIONS

02:02:44.523 --> 02:02:45.791
ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:47.660
THEY PAY LIVING WAGES. THIS IS

02:02:47.727 --> 02:02:49.862
THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO FOR

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:52.164

02:04:51.083 --> 02:04:53.452
LESS COST TO THEM THE BY THEN

02:04:53.519 --> 02:04:58.757
WAS FOR THEM IN THAT AREA. I

02:04:58.824 --> 02:05:00.559
GUESS WE SORT OF DESERVE WHAT

02:05:00.626 --> 02:05:02.561
WE GET AND COMPLAINING ABOUT

02:05:02.628 --> 02:05:05.664
IT. OVER THESE DECADES. HAS NOT

02:05:05.731 --> 02:05:09.501
ACHIEVED VERY MUCH. MAYBE ANY

02:05:09.568 --> 02:05:13.772
EFFORT IS WELL WORTH IT. BUT IF

02:05:13.839 --> 02:05:14.340
YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES THAT

02:05:14.406 --> 02:05:17.076
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND

02:05:17.142 --> 02:05:19.411
EVEN THE QUOTE DEAL. DOES NOT

02:05:19.478 --> 02:05:26.518
TAKE US VERY FAR DOWN THE PATH.

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:29.188
WE ALSO THEN HAVE ISSUES SUCH

02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:31.757
AS OUR FIRE IN PARADISE WHERE

02:05:31.824 --> 02:05:35.361
THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS.

02:05:35.427 --> 02:05:37.763
ACTIVELY SEEKING TO DE POPULATE

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:38.297
THESE AREAS ANOTHER DO NOT

02:05:38.364 --> 02:05:42.534
REBUILT. WE DON'T WANT YOU. TO

02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:45.204
STAY LIVING HERE. THE

02:05:45.271 --> 02:05:48.474
CALIFORNIA. IN PARADISE IN

02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:51.176
BUTTE COUNTY. THAT IS NOT AN

02:05:51.243 --> 02:05:55.981
ANSWER. AN ANSWER CERTAINLY IS

02:05:56.048 --> 02:06:00.252
SUPPLY. AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR A

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:02.021
LOT MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW

02:06:02.087 --> 02:06:07.326
WE ENHANCE AND EXPAND. SUPPLY.

02:06:07.393 --> 02:06:11.563
THE REGULATORY RELIEF IN PART.

02:06:11.630 --> 02:06:13.732
BY DOING THINGS THAT PROVIDE

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:17.569
MORE JOBS TO CALIFORNIANS. SO

02:06:17.636 --> 02:06:21.907
THEY CAN AFFORD TO BUY. BUT NOT

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:24.209
WITHOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:25.945
EQUATION BEING HANDLED AND THAT

02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:28.180
IS THE COSTS. OF THAT HOUSING

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:33.485
ITSELF. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:37.890
THIS MAY BE A STEP. BUT I THINK

02:06:37.957 --> 02:06:39.892
IT COULD BE SAFELY ASSURED. IN

02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:43.796
FIVE YEARS. WE'LL BE HAVING

02:06:43.862 --> 02:06:46.332
EXACTLY THE SAME DEBATE HERE.

02:06:46.398 --> 02:06:49.301
AND THIS REMEDY. WE'LL HAVE

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:52.705
BEEN PERICA BEST. AND MORE

02:06:52.771 --> 02:06:53.172
PEOPLE WILL HAVE LEFT

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:59.378
CALIFORNIA. AND FEWER. OF OUR

02:06:59.445 --> 02:06:59.979
FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE

02:07:00.045 --> 02:07:01.947
TO STAY. WHERE THEY WERE BORN

02:07:02.014 --> 02:07:05.584
AND RAISED. THAT'S A SAD

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:07.553
COMMENTARY ABOUT A GREAT STATE.

02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:10.522
I URGE NO VOTE. THANK YOU

02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:16.528
SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU

02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:17.629
VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT THIS

02:07:17.696 --> 02:07:19.832
IS BEEN A REALLY INTRIGUING

02:07:19.898 --> 02:07:22.468
THOUGHTFUL DEBATE AND AS I SAID

02:07:22.534 --> 02:07:23.068
HER LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES I

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:27.206
SAID I. REALIZE THAT I HATE

02:07:27.272 --> 02:07:30.609
HATE HATE TO ADMIT. BUT I AM

02:07:30.676 --> 02:07:33.479
OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THAT MY

02:07:33.545 --> 02:07:36.181
PARENTS PAID ONE HUNDRED AND

02:07:36.248 --> 02:07:38.717
NINETEEN DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:39.284
TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE

02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:43.455
MARK PARK. EITHER I'M REALLY

02:07:43.522 --> 02:07:45.424
REALLY OLD OR THE RENT CAR

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:49.395
ROCKETED IN A VERY. FEW YEARS I

02:07:49.461 --> 02:07:50.029
THINK WE ALL KNOW THE ANSWER TO

02:07:50.095 --> 02:07:55.100
THAT OLD. AND WE ALL ARE CLEAR

02:07:55.167 --> 02:07:56.869
THAT WE HAVEN'T BILL TODAY WE

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:58.504
ARE ALL CLEAR THAT OUR

02:07:58.570 --> 02:07:58.937
POPULATION HAS GROWN

02:07:59.004 --> 02:08:01.807
EXPONENTIALLY. BUT YOU KNOW I

02:08:01.874 --> 02:08:03.509
WORRY ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS I

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:04.910
REPRESENT BALL ONE VILLAGE IN

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:07.413
LOS ANGELES CITY COUNTY ONE OF

02:08:07.479 --> 02:08:09.148
THE AREAS THAT MR AMERICA

02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:13.786
pCALIFORNIA. BUILT ON A AND

02:08:13.852 --> 02:08:17.189
DESIGNED A HIGH END APARTMENT

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:19.024
COMMUNITY HI IT'S

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.492
AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS THE

02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:23.128
JUNGLE. AND IT WAS KNOWN AS THE

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:24.863
JUNGLE BECAUSE HE IMPORTED

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:27.533
TROPICAL PLANTS AND FOR ALLEGE

02:08:27.599 --> 02:08:30.035
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. EVERY

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:31.003
APARTMENT BUILDING HAD SWIMMING

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:34.073
POOLS WE WERE WALKING CLOSETS

02:08:34.139 --> 02:08:36.275
AND IT WAS HIGH LIVIN AS MY

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:39.344
FATHER WOULD SAY IN LOS ANGELES.

02:08:39.411 --> 02:08:40.779
ALL THOSE APARTMENT BUILDINGS

02:08:40.846 --> 02:08:41.613
IN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THEM

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.382
IN THIS COMMUNITY WERE BUILT

02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:45.217
MANY OF THEM ON STILTS WITH THE

02:08:45.284 --> 02:08:47.352
PARKING UNDERNEATH. YOU KNOW IN

02:08:47.419 --> 02:08:51.256
THE FIFTIES. AND I WORRY ABOUT

02:08:51.323 --> 02:08:53.792
SEISMIC SAFETY I KNOW A NUMBER

02:08:53.859 --> 02:08:55.594
OF THOSE APARTMENT OWNERS IN

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:56.161
THAT COMMUNITY THEY WERE MY

02:08:56.228 --> 02:09:00.699
PARENTS PEERS AND I WORRY THAT

02:09:00.766 --> 02:09:02.835
IF THE WIND THE NEXT BIG ONE

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:10.109
COMES A LOS ANGELES AND BALLING.

02:09:10.175 --> 02:09:10.642
IT IS HOME TO THOUSANDS OF

02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:14.113
ANGELENOS. AND YOU KNOW THAT

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:15.047
WAS INTO THIS DEBATE I'M

02:09:15.114 --> 02:09:16.281
REMINDED THAT PROPERTY

02:09:16.348 --> 02:09:17.749
OWNERSHIP IS VERY SIMILAR TO

02:09:17.816 --> 02:09:19.618
RUNNING A BUSINESS AND THE

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:22.855
DEBATE IS SIMILAR ON THIS FLOOR.

02:09:22.921 --> 02:09:23.489
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT INCREASING

02:09:23.555 --> 02:09:26.525
MINIMUM WAGE. TRYING TO BRING A

02:09:26.592 --> 02:09:28.060
CLOSER TO A LIVABLE WAGE IN

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:29.128
CALIFORNIA WE HEARD THE

02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:31.563
BUSINESSES COULDN'T AFFORD AND

02:09:31.630 --> 02:09:32.164
THEY WOULD GO OUT OF TOWN THEY

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:34.166
WOULD BUT LEAVE THE STATE. WELL

02:09:34.233 --> 02:09:36.668
THE SAME APPLY PROPERTY OWNERS

02:09:36.735 --> 02:09:39.872
WHO RELY ON RENTAL INCOME. TO

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:41.807
MAKE A PROFIT TO PAY THEIR

02:09:41.874 --> 02:09:42.441
MORTGAGE WHATEVER THE CASE MAY

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:44.743
BE A COLLEAGUE TALKED ABOUT

02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:45.911
FAMILY MEMBERS THAT OWN

02:09:45.978 --> 02:09:47.513
PROPERTY THAT'S FIFTY YEARS OLD

02:09:47.579 --> 02:09:49.047
WELL YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS IF

02:09:49.114 --> 02:09:50.349
YOU OWN PROPERTY FOR A GOOD

02:09:50.415 --> 02:09:53.886
NUMBER OF YEARS OF WHAT EVER

02:09:53.952 --> 02:09:54.453
WRITTEN YOU'RE EARNING THIS

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:55.053
PROBABLY TURNING A PROFIT FOR

02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:56.755
YOU. SO MUCH LIKE THE

02:09:56.822 --> 02:09:58.357
BUSINESSES THE QUESTION IS HOW

02:09:58.423 --> 02:09:59.525
DO WE CREATE A SENSE OF

02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:01.426
BALANCE. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

02:10:01.493 --> 02:10:03.562
STOP I'M NOT TRYING TO START

02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:04.196
BUSINESSES FOR MAKING A PROFIT.

02:10:04.263 --> 02:10:06.798
BUT ON THE BACKS OF. AND

02:10:06.865 --> 02:10:08.967
CREATING THE SENSE OF BALANCE.

02:10:09.034 --> 02:10:13.005
BUSINESSES ARE SUCCESSFUL WHENTHEY HAVE A SUCCESSFUL

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:16.308
EMPLOYEES WELL TRAINED. HAPPY

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:17.943
EMPLOYEES THAT DELIVER HIGH

02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:20.612
QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT

02:10:20.679 --> 02:10:21.213
INCREASE THE PROPERTY ON YOUR

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:25.651
BUSINESS. PROPERTY OWNERS RELY

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:27.553
ON RENTER'S BEING ABLE TO

02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:30.422
AFFORD YOUR RENT OR YOU WILL

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:32.891
HAVE IN THE UNITS PHILLIPS IT'S

02:10:32.958 --> 02:10:34.693
NOT A US VERSUS THEM IT'S A

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:38.597
WEAK SCENARIO. AS WE TALK ABOUT

02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:39.531
HOW WE BUILD THE CALIFORNIA

02:10:39.598 --> 02:10:40.132
THAT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD TO BE

02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:42.634
HOUSED IN. OUR COLLEAGUE SAID

02:10:42.701 --> 02:10:43.902
THAT OVER TIME THE WE'VE

02:10:43.969 --> 02:10:45.938
TINKERED AROUND THIS ISSUE FOR

02:10:46.004 --> 02:10:49.374
A WHILE IT'S PROBABLY RIGHT. I

02:10:49.441 --> 02:10:52.377
THINK IT'S TIME FOR PERHAPS.

02:10:52.444 --> 02:10:53.645
THAT WE STOP TINKERING AND

02:10:53.712 --> 02:10:55.314
ENGAGE IN SOME RADICAL THINKING

02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:58.917
A RADICAL CHANGE. BECAUSE WE

02:10:58.984 --> 02:11:02.688
ARE EXPERIENCING. LIVING

02:11:02.754 --> 02:11:04.256
CONDITIONS IN ALL OF OUR

02:11:04.323 --> 02:11:06.291
DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE THAT

02:11:06.358 --> 02:11:06.892
REQUIRES RADICAL ACTION ON OUR

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:14.800
PART. WE WATCHED AREAS ACROSS

02:11:14.866 --> 02:11:15.334
THIS COUNTRY IN STATE THAT

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.071
PERHAPS. PROPERTY IS LOWER THAT

02:11:19.137 --> 02:11:23.208
HAVE LESS REGULATION AND DON'T

02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:24.209
HAVE THIS ONEROUS ZONING

02:11:24.276 --> 02:11:25.978
REQUIREMENTS IN THOSE ARE ALSO

02:11:26.044 --> 02:11:29.014
AREAS THAT I'VE SEEN TEXAS

02:11:29.081 --> 02:11:29.615
BEING ONCE THEY OR WE THOUGHT

02:11:29.681 --> 02:11:31.917
MASS DEVASTATION. WHERE WE

02:11:31.984 --> 02:11:32.951
LEARNED THAT PROPERTY LIFE WAS

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:34.686
LOST IN PROPERTY WAS LOST

02:11:34.753 --> 02:11:37.422
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF REGULATION

02:11:37.489 --> 02:11:39.925
AND A LACK OF ADHERENCE TO A

02:11:39.992 --> 02:11:42.394
ZONING PERSPECTIVE. WE LIVE IN

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:44.296
EARTHQUAKE WE LIVE IN FIRE

02:11:44.363 --> 02:11:45.364
COUNTRY AND SO WE DON'T HAVE

02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:46.398
THE LUXURY OF NOT BEING

02:11:46.465 --> 02:11:48.467
THOUGHTFUL AND DEVELOPING

02:11:48.533 --> 02:11:50.435
REGULATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW US

02:11:50.502 --> 02:11:52.704
TO BUILD HOUSING AND STRUCTURES

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:54.906
THAT WILL PROTECT LIVES. AND

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:57.676
CAN BE SUSTAINED OVER TIME. IS

02:11:57.743 --> 02:11:59.311
THE PER UNIT COST FOR NEW

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:00.846
CONSTRUCTION TO HIGH ABSOLUTELY

02:12:00.912 --> 02:12:02.848
DOES IT VARY WIDELY ACROSS THE

02:12:02.914 --> 02:12:06.418
STATE YES. AND SO THOSE ARE ALL

02:12:06.485 --> 02:12:07.686
PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE TAT WE'RE

02:12:07.753 --> 02:12:10.222
GOING TO HAVE TO DEBATE AND

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:12.357
COME TO A CONCLUSION AND HOW WE

02:12:12.424 --> 02:12:13.191
MANAGE IT AND A HEALTHY

02:12:13.258 --> 02:12:15.527
PRODUCTIVE WAY. TO CREATE TO

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:15.927
CONTINUE TO CREATE

02:12:15.994 --> 02:12:16.395
OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW

02:12:16.461 --> 02:12:19.031
CONSTRUCTION. AND MAKE SURE

02:12:19.097 --> 02:12:21.166
THAT IT'S NOT SUCH THAT

02:12:21.233 --> 02:12:21.767
VIRTUALLY NO ONE ARE ONLY THE

02:12:21.833 --> 02:12:26.004
1% CAN AFFORD IT. I AM A PROUD

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:27.973
CO AUTHOR OF FOURTEEN EIGHTY

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:28.540
TWO AND WILL BE SUPPORT IT

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:30.175
TODAY. AND WHAT I WOULD JUST

02:12:30.242 --> 02:12:32.210
CHALLENGE ALL OF US TO THINK IS

02:12:32.277 --> 02:12:34.579
BECAUSE WE HAVE COLLEAGUES TO

02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:35.113
WAX FOR ELOQUENTLY ON THIS

02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:37.416
FLOOR. TO GET TO A CONCLUSION

02:12:37.482 --> 02:12:41.086
OF A NO VOTE. AND SO IF WE

02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:43.355
CONTINUE TO SAY NO. TO THESE

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:49.428
CHRONIC. SITUATIONS THAT WE ALL

02:12:49.494 --> 02:12:51.897
FIND OURSELVES IN WHAT ARE WE

02:12:51.963 --> 02:12:53.899
GOING TO SAY YES TO ARE WE

02:12:53.965 --> 02:12:56.034
GOING TO CONTINUE TO TINKER OR

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:57.269
CONTINUE TO DEBATE OR WAX

02:12:57.336 --> 02:13:00.005
FOURTH ELOQUENT ON PUBLIC

02:13:00.072 --> 02:13:00.972
POLICY SOLUTIONS AND BRING

02:13:01.039 --> 02:13:02.641
NOTHING TO THE TABLE AS A

02:13:02.708 --> 02:13:05.310
SOLUTION THAT'S NOT HELPFUL TO

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:08.347
YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE MINE. SO

02:13:08.413 --> 02:13:09.147
FOR THOSE REASONS I AM PROUD

02:13:09.214 --> 02:13:12.617
TODAY TO VOTE FOR A SOLUTION AB

02:13:12.684 --> 02:13:15.854
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU

OUR LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE

02:14:41.973 --> 02:14:44.009
PRODUCTION SIDE AS WELL AS THE

02:14:44.075 --> 02:14:46.578
FUNDING SIDE MANY OF THE

02:14:46.645 --> 02:14:47.212
FUNDING ISSUES WE'VE BEEN

02:14:47.279 --> 02:14:49.481

HOUSING AND I SAID WE HAVE A

02:15:01.493 --> 02:15:02.761
PROBLEM. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:03.829
HAVE A PROBLEM AND BECAUSE OF

02:15:03.895 --> 02:15:04.463
THE POLITICAL REALITIES IN THE

02:15:04.529 --> 02:15:05.630
CONSTRAINTS THAT EACH OF US

02:15:05.697 --> 02:15:07.966
FEEL FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

02:15:08.033 --> 02:15:10.268
WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME

02:15:10.335 --> 02:15:10.802
COMPLETELY ADDRESSING THIS

02:15:10.869 --> 02:15:15.407
PROBLEM. I WOULD SAY I'D- JUST

02:15:15.474 --> 02:15:20.212
A FEW POINTS. THE KID IN THE

02:15:20.278 --> 02:15:22.981
ISSUE TODAY WE ARE IN A CRISIS.

02:15:23.048 --> 02:15:26.551
AND IN STATE LAW THERE ARE ANTI

02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:29.454
GALGIANI. LAWS THAT ADDRESS

02:15:29.521 --> 02:15:31.223
WITH ALMOST ANY KIND OF NATURAL

02:15:31.289 --> 02:15:34.159
DISASTER AS AS I SAID. THERE

02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:34.893
ISN'T ONE THAT SORT OF FITS

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:37.729
THIS MOLD. WE HAVE TO WORK TO

02:15:37.796 --> 02:15:40.732
FIND AN ANSWER TO ADDRESS THE

02:15:40.799 --> 02:15:42.767
MOST EGREGIOUS SITUATIONS

02:15:42.834 --> 02:15:43.835
SITUATIONS LIKE RENTERS WHO

02:15:43.902 --> 02:15:45.737
WORK IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE

02:15:45.804 --> 02:15:46.271
HOSPITALS PEOPLE WITH GOOD

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:49.741
CAREERS. CAREER SAID IF YOU

02:15:49.808 --> 02:15:50.876
KNOW WHERE I GREW UP IF I HAD A

02:15:50.942 --> 02:15:53.378
CAREER AS A NURSERY TEACHER.

02:15:53.445 --> 02:15:54.012
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN MAKING IT IN

02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:56.214
LIFE. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:15:56.281 --> 02:15:58.049
MAKING IT. SO HOW DO YOU HAVE A

02:15:58.116 --> 02:15:59.751
GOOD CAREER AND YOU'RE MAKING

02:15:59.818 --> 02:16:00.652
IT AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE

02:16:00.719 --> 02:16:03.021
RENT. SO WHETHER IT'S IN OUR

02:16:03.088 --> 02:16:05.257
SCHOOLS ARE HOSPITAL SMALL

02:16:05.323 --> 02:16:07.259
BUSINESSES EMERGENCY SERVICES.

02:16:07.325 --> 02:16:08.560
THEY DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED

02:16:08.627 --> 02:16:10.061
FROM AGREE JUST RENT INCREASES

02:16:10.128 --> 02:16:12.330
AND CAPRICIOUS EVICTIONS THAT

02:16:12.397 --> 02:16:12.931
COULD LEAD THEM HOMELESS WE'RE

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:15.634
SEEING THAT HAPPEN. THE PEOPLE

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:16.968
WHO WILL BE MOST AFFECTED BY A.

02:16:17.035 --> 02:16:19.004
B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO

02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:20.539
APARTMENT OWNERS AND BUILDERS.

02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:21.840
ARE ACTUALLY NOT OPPOSED TO

02:16:21.907 --> 02:16:23.308
THIS BILL. AND THAT'S A

02:16:23.375 --> 02:16:26.244
REACTION OF A FOLLOW UP FROM

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:26.845
THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT ONE OF

02:16:26.912 --> 02:16:29.447
MY COLLEAGUES REFERENCED. THIS

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:30.282
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT

02:16:30.348 --> 02:16:32.684
BALLOT MEASURE. IT'S VERY

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:33.852
DIFFERENT BECAUSE THOSE VERY

02:16:33.919 --> 02:16:35.787
PEOPLE OPPOSED CAME TO THE

02:16:35.854 --> 02:16:38.823
TABLE AND SAID LET'S KEEP

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:40.892
HAMMERING OUT SOME SOLUTIONS

02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:42.594
HERE. THAT CAN GET US DOWN THE

02:16:42.661 --> 02:16:45.297
ROAD WHILE WE DEAL IN A DRESS

02:16:45.363 --> 02:16:47.065
IF WE CAN THE ISSUE OF

02:16:47.132 --> 02:16:49.367
PRODUCTION. FOR THE VERY PEOPLE

02:16:49.434 --> 02:16:52.003
OPPOSED ARE NOW NEUTRAL BECAUSE

02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:53.705
THEY'VE WEIGHED IN AND THEY'VE

02:16:53.772 --> 02:16:56.675
SAID. HERE'S WHAT WE THINK. AND

02:16:56.741 --> 02:16:59.077
SO THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL OUT

02:16:59.144 --> 02:17:02.280
WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS

02:17:02.347 --> 02:17:02.847
HAS REALLY TRIED TO THREAD A

02:17:02.914 --> 02:17:08.887
VERY VERY. THEN NEEDLE. AND I

02:17:08.954 --> 02:17:11.156
JUST I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE

02:17:11.222 --> 02:17:13.458
CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE

02:17:13.525 --> 02:17:14.059
RENT CONTROL THIS IS NOT RENT

02:17:14.125 --> 02:17:19.130
CONTROL. THIS IS. NOT RENT

02:17:19.197 --> 02:17:20.799
CONTROL IT IS A RENT CAP. IN

02:17:20.865 --> 02:17:25.403
CPI. COMBINED IN ORDER TO ALLOW

02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:28.506
PROPERTY OWNERS TO CONTINUE. TO

02:17:28.573 --> 02:17:31.743
HAVE THEIR INVESTMENT BE REAL.

02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:33.244
THEY'LL STILL BE ABLE TO PROFIT

02:17:33.311 --> 02:17:33.945
FROM THEIR INVESTMENTS AND

02:17:34.012 --> 02:17:36.047
MANAGE THEIR PROPERTIES SO IT'S

02:17:36.114 --> 02:17:37.482
NOT EVERY DAY WHERE YOU'RE ABLE

02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:38.550
TO GET TEN IT GROUPS AND

02:17:38.617 --> 02:17:40.285
BUSINESS INTEREST TO COME

02:17:40.352 --> 02:17:41.553
TOGETHER TO COMPROMISE ON

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.355
GETTING SOME SIGNIFICANT RELIEF

02:17:43.421 --> 02:17:45.490
TO RENTERS I DO WANT TO ADD MY

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:47.726
THANKS TO SENATOR HERTZBERG WHO

02:17:47.792 --> 02:17:49.527
CAME VERY CLOSE TO NEGOTIATING

02:17:49.594 --> 02:17:51.463
AN AGREEMENT ON THIS ISSUE LAST

02:17:51.529 --> 02:17:53.999
YEAR. BUT RAN OUT OF TIME. AND

02:17:54.065 --> 02:17:55.233
I HAVE TO THANK THE BILL'S

02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:56.668
AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID

02:17:56.735 --> 02:17:58.136
CHIU. AND THOSE WHO'VE

02:17:58.203 --> 02:17:59.904
NEGOTIATED THE BILL FOR

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:03.208
BRINGING THIS FINAL PRODUCT.

02:18:03.274 --> 02:18:04.576
AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS BEEN A

02:18:04.643 --> 02:18:07.245
PRIORITY TO ME FOR A LONG TIME.

02:18:07.312 --> 02:18:08.346
BUT I THINK YOU ALSO KNOW I'M

02:18:08.413 --> 02:18:09.981
NOT ONE TO STAND UP AND TAKE A

02:18:10.048 --> 02:18:11.716
LEAD ON EVERY BILL IN THIS

02:18:11.783 --> 02:18:13.351
HOUSE EVERY BILL THE A IT'S

02:18:13.418 --> 02:18:16.221
JUST NOT. WHAT I THINK MY JOB

02:18:16.287 --> 02:18:18.556
IS AS THE PRO TEM OF THE SENATE.

02:18:18.623 --> 02:18:21.726
BUT THIS BILL. IS DIFFERENT.

02:18:21.793 --> 02:18:22.861
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

02:18:22.927 --> 02:18:26.431
BECAUSE- MANAGING AB FOURTEEN

02:18:26.498 --> 02:18:29.034
EIGHTY TWO. IS NECESSARY FOR US

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:30.268
TO DO AS PART OF A

02:18:30.335 --> 02:18:32.103
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO

02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:35.073
ADDRESS THIS CRISIS NOW. TO

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.374
ANSWER A COMMON OF ONE OF MY

02:18:36.441 --> 02:18:40.545
COLLEAGUES. THERE IS AN LA TEN

02:18:40.612 --> 02:18:43.615
YEAR REVIEW. I KNOW YOU

02:18:43.682 --> 02:18:44.582
MENTIONED FIVE YEARS OR SAID

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:45.450
ELLIE TENURE REVIEW TO

02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:47.619
DETERMINE. WHAT WERE WE ABLE TO

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:49.888
DO IN THE TIME. THAT WE HAVE

02:18:49.954 --> 02:18:52.490
ALLOWED FOR THE SUNSET. BUT I

02:18:52.557 --> 02:18:54.192
WOULD ALSO SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES

02:18:54.259 --> 02:18:56.861
WHO CHAIR. COMMITTEES HOUSING

02:18:56.928 --> 02:18:59.330
GOVERNMENT FINANCE OTHERS. AND

02:18:59.397 --> 02:19:01.132
THE VICE CHAIRS. WE HAVE THE

02:19:01.199 --> 02:19:02.600
ABILITY TO LOOK AT THIS ON AN

02:19:02.667 --> 02:19:04.302
ANNUAL BASIS AND TO HAVE THE

02:19:04.369 --> 02:19:05.804
NUMBERS COME FORWARD WE HAVE

02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:07.872
THE ABILITY. TO KIND OF MONITOR

02:19:07.939 --> 02:19:09.507
THIS AS WE GO AND I WOULD URGE

02:19:09.574 --> 02:19:13.611
US. TO DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK.

02:19:13.678 --> 02:19:14.913
IT IS PART OF REALLY

02:19:14.979 --> 02:19:16.948
UNDERSTANDING WHERE WE ARE ARE.

02:19:17.015 --> 02:19:21.352
AND I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW THE

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:22.554
MARKET DOES RESPOND TO THIS I

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:23.488
SEE LOTS OF CRANES IN THE AIR

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:24.389
IN DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO THAT I

02:19:24.456 --> 02:19:26.958
DIDN'T SEE. FIVE YEARS AGO. THE

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:29.994
ISSUE IS THE MARKET IS HELPING

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:32.397
US TO BUILD LUXURY CONDOS AND

02:19:32.464 --> 02:19:34.999
LUXURY APARTMENTS. AND THAT'S

02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:37.902
PART OF THE SUPPLY ISSUE BUT IN

02:19:37.969 --> 02:19:40.805
TERMS OF AFFORDABLE OR LOW

02:19:40.872 --> 02:19:42.741
INCOME BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF

02:19:42.807 --> 02:19:43.675
HARD TO SAY WHAT IS AFFORDABLE

02:19:43.742 --> 02:19:45.944
TODAY. WE'RE HAVING TO PUT

02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:48.413
MONEY FORWARD TO SUBSIDIZE

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:48.980
DEVELOPERS WHO ARE TRYING TO

02:19:49.047 --> 02:19:53.384
BUILD. THIS IS A PIECE OF THE

02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:55.620
PUZZLE. THAT WILL ALLOW US THE

02:19:55.687 --> 02:19:57.922
TIME. TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE

02:19:57.989 --> 02:20:01.693
ISSUES IN POLICY AND BUDGET BUT

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:03.294
AT THE SAME TIME THOSE PEOPLE

02:20:03.361 --> 02:20:04.462
THAT WE'VE MENTIONED AND HEARD

02:20:04.529 --> 02:20:07.165
THE STORIES ABOUT THE ONES THAT

02:20:07.232 --> 02:20:08.666
KEEP MISS SKINNER AWAKE AT

02:20:08.733 --> 02:20:12.036
NIGHT. THEY CAN'T WAIT FOR US

02:20:12.103 --> 02:20:15.440
TO CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE WHICH

02:20:15.507 --> 02:20:17.242
IN SOME OF OUR CASES IS REALLY

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:19.077
THEORETICAL WE HAVE A

02:20:19.144 --> 02:20:20.578
RESPONSIBILITY TO THESE

02:20:20.645 --> 02:20:22.113
CONSTITUENTS UP AND DOWN OUR

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:24.849
STATE. REGARDLESS NORTH SOUTH

02:20:24.916 --> 02:20:27.485
INLAND COASTAL OUT WE HAVE A

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:29.254
RESPONSIBILITY TO THESE

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:30.989
RESIDENTS TO TRY TO GIVE SOME

02:20:31.055 --> 02:20:32.924
RELIEF. TO TRY TO GET SOME

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:34.959
RELIEF AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON

02:20:35.026 --> 02:20:37.362
US TO SEE THIS THROUGH AND TO

02:20:37.428 --> 02:20:38.830
TAKE UP THOSE ISSUES THOSE

02:20:38.897 --> 02:20:40.498
OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO THIS

02:20:40.565 --> 02:20:43.101
DILEMMA SO THAT WE BEGIN TO

02:20:43.168 --> 02:20:43.835
SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA

02:20:43.902 --> 02:20:45.670
WE ARE A GREAT STATE. BUT THE

02:20:45.737 --> 02:20:47.272

BEEN IDLE FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE

02:59:44.773 --> 02:59:45.307

DESERTION. AS ALL PRODUCTION.

02:59:49.979 --> 02:59:51.347
GOES THROUGH ITS PHASES IN

02:59:51.413 --> 02:59:54.116
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS HAVE BEEN

02:59:54.183 --> 02:59:55.584
STUCK WITH THE BAG FAR TOO MANY

02:59:55.651 --> 02:59:58.487
TIMES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN

02:59:58.554 --> 03:00:00.789
COMPANIES LIKE GRECO PREVENT

03:00:00.856 --> 03:00:02.491
ECHO LEFT THEIR OFFSHORE

03:00:02.558 --> 03:00:05.327
PLATFORMS ABANDON MAY HAVE BEEN

03:00:05.394 --> 03:00:07.730
HIT WITH THAT BILL. THIS BILL

03:00:07.796 --> 03:00:11.233
IS PART OF A LONG. LONG

03:00:11.300 --> 03:00:13.269
NEGOTIATED PROCESS LED BY

03:00:13.335 --> 03:00:14.603
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW MOAN WHO

03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:16.305
REPRESENTS THAT REGION THAT WAS

03:00:16.372 --> 03:00:17.973
HIT HARD BY THOSE ABANDONED

03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:20.376
PROJECTS AND I THINK REFLECTS A

03:00:20.442 --> 03:00:22.578
VERY REASONABLE COMPROMISE WHEN

03:00:22.645 --> 03:00:25.247
IT COMES TO ASKING THE OIL

03:00:25.314 --> 03:00:28.184
INDUSTRY TO PUT UP SOME AMOUNT

03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:31.220
OF SECURITY FOR THE REASONABLE

03:00:31.287 --> 03:00:34.056
COST. OF CLEANING UP THEIR

03:00:34.123 --> 03:00:35.658
WELLS OR PLUGGING THEM IN

03:00:35.724 --> 03:00:37.493
ABANDONING THEM WHEN THEY DO

03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:41.997
DESERT THOSE WELLS. FOR THIRTY

03:00:42.064 --> 03:00:42.565
MILLION DOLLARS WHICHEVER IS

03:00:42.631 --> 03:00:45.467
LESS. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR

03:00:45.534 --> 03:00:47.603
THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT

03:00:47.670 --> 03:00:49.071
OF INFORMATION MOVING AROUND

03:00:49.138 --> 03:00:51.240
ABOUT THIS MEASURE AND I KNOW

03:00:51.307 --> 03:00:52.341
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT'LL

03:00:52.408 --> 03:00:56.879
BE RAISED HERE. BUT TO BE CLEAR

03:00:56.946 --> 03:00:59.548
THIS S NOT INTENDED TO GO

03:00:59.615 --> 03:01:02.084
AFTER OR TARGET THE SMALLER OIL

03:01:02.151 --> 03:01:05.821
PRODUCERS IN THIS STATE. BUT IT

03:01:05.888 --> 03:01:08.657
IT'S NOT FAIR IN MY ESTIMATION

03:01:08.724 --> 03:01:11.360
TO ALLOW THOSE PRODUCERS TO NOT

03:01:11.427 --> 03:01:13.295
HAVE ANY SECURITY FOR THE

03:01:13.362 --> 03:01:15.297
COSTUME PLUGIN ABANDONING THOSE

03:01:15.364 --> 03:01:16.198
WELLS NOW WHAT THE REASON WILL

03:01:16.265 --> 03:01:19.268
COST OF THAT IS REMAINS TO BE

03:01:19.335 --> 03:01:21.503
SEEN BUT ACCORDING TO THE BILL.

03:01:21.570 --> 03:01:22.771
THEY CAN BE BASED ON THE

03:01:22.838 --> 03:01:23.973
OPERATORS COST ESTIMATES IT

03:01:24.039 --> 03:01:26.575
PROVIDED TO DEPARTMENT OF OIL

03:01:26.642 --> 03:01:27.042
AND GAS AND GEOTHERMAL

03:01:27.109 --> 03:01:29.979
RESOURCES. SO WE THINK HIS BILL

03:01:30.045 --> 03:01:33.382
REPRESENTS A FAIR COMPROMISE

03:01:33.449 --> 03:01:36.518
BETWEEN ENVIRONMENT. INDUSTRY

03:01:36.585 --> 03:01:38.187
AND ALSO MAKE SOME IMPORTANT

03:01:38.254 --> 03:01:39.421
CHANGES THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

03:01:39.488 --> 03:01:42.124
WEIGHED IN ON. THEN WHEN IT

03:01:42.191 --> 03:01:43.359
COMES TO THE FUTURE OF DOG

03:01:43.425 --> 03:01:46.528
WHICH IS BEEN A PLAGUED AGENCY.

03:01:46.595 --> 03:01:47.529
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEES BEEN

03:01:47.596 --> 03:01:49.298
FRUSTRATED WITH IT THERE'S

03:01:49.365 --> 03:01:51.133
DISTRUST ALSO FROM THE OIL

03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:54.270
INDUSTRY AND IS RESOURCES CHAIR

03:01:54.336 --> 03:01:56.238
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME

03:01:56.305 --> 03:01:57.640
WAY TO TURN THE PAGE WITH

03:01:57.706 --> 03:01:59.541
DAUGHTER. SO THE GOVERNOR'S

03:01:59.608 --> 03:02:02.611
OFFICE HAS SUGGESTED AT LEAST

03:02:02.678 --> 03:02:06.782
AS AN OPENING SALVO. TO ALTER

03:02:06.849 --> 03:02:09.585
THE NAME OF THE DIVISION. TO

03:02:09.652 --> 03:02:10.219
THE DIVISION OF GEOLOGIC ENERGY

03:02:10.286 --> 03:02:13.856
MANAGEMENT. AND ALSO TO MAKE

03:02:13.922 --> 03:02:15.824
CLEAR WHAT ITS MISSION TRULY

03:02:15.891 --> 03:02:17.926
IS. HEALTH AND SAFETY YES ARE A

03:02:17.993 --> 03:02:19.962
PART OF THAT AND THAT. THAT

SETTLERS. LIKE THAT I DON'T

03:36:45.592 --> 03:36:47.594

THAT A AN ANTIQUE IF YOU WILL

03:36:57.070 --> 03:36:59.706

03:36:59.773 --> 03:37:02.075

SHUT DOWN LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES

03:37:23.196 --> 03:37:26.333
OR INDUSTRIES. I THINK THE FREE

03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:30.036
MARKET SHOULD DO THAT.

03:37:30.103 --> 03:37:32.372
SACRAMENTO'S DOING SO EVEN

03:37:32.439 --> 03:37:32.939

PURCHASE. SUCH A PRODUCT BUT IT

03:37:36.743 --> 03:37:38.545
DOESN'T GIVE US THE RIGHT TO DO

03:37:38.612 --> 03:37:40.714
SO I BELIEVE IT SENDS A

03:37:40.781 --> 03:37:44.451
CHILLING CHILLING MESSAGE. TO

03:37:59.132 --> 03:38:00.801
BILL WHEN IT CAME BEFORE

03:38:00.867 --> 03:38:04.438
JUDICIARY. I POSE THE QUESTION

03:38:04.504 --> 03:38:07.140
THAT I DON'T THINK I EVER. THE

03:38:07.207 --> 03:38:10.777
PROPER WANTS TO THAT THERE IS

03:38:10.844 --> 03:38:12.846
AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION

03:38:12.913 --> 03:38:14.481
AND SIGNATORY ENTITIES AND

03:38:14.548 --> 03:38:15.916
SIGNATORY STATES TO THIS

03:38:15.982 --> 03:38:20.620
CONVENTION THAT PRESCRIBE THE

03:38:20.687 --> 03:38:23.290
LAWFUL CENTER BORDERS IS THAT A

03:38:23.356 --> 03:38:24.291
QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR OR THE

03:38:24.357 --> 03:38:25.792
FLOOR MANAGER FOR USE MAKE IS

03:38:25.859 --> 03:38:28.395
STATEMENT JUST. SPEAKING OKAY

03:38:28.462 --> 03:38:31.331
VERY GOOD THANK YOU SIR AND- I

03:38:31.398 --> 03:38:33.333
ASKED THE QUESTION WHY DON'T WE

03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:37.103
INVEST IN MAKING THIS FRAMEWORK

03:38:37.170 --> 03:38:38.038
THAT ALREADY EXISTS MORE

03:38:38.104 --> 03:38:40.140
ROBUST. IF WE'RE CONCERNED

03:38:40.207 --> 03:38:42.275
ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS

03:38:42.342 --> 03:38:43.410
AND WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN

03:38:43.477 --> 03:38:46.379
THAT THE ILLICIT TRADE IS

03:38:46.446 --> 03:38:49.249
REDUCED IN MEANINGFUL WAYS.

03:38:49.316 --> 03:38:53.653
SIMPLY HAVING CALIFORNIA TAKE A

03:38:53.720 --> 03:38:55.889
PROHIBITION APPROACH I DON'T

03:38:55.956 --> 03:38:58.091
THINK IS GOING TO REALLY AFFECT

03:38:58.158 --> 03:38:58.959
THE CHANGE THAT THAT PEOPLE

03:38:59.025 --> 03:39:02.395
WANT. SO I GUESS THE REASON WHY

03:39:02.462 --> 03:39:03.730
I WOULD BE IN OPPOSITION TO

03:39:03.797 --> 03:39:06.466
THIS. IN ADDITION TO SOME OF

03:39:06.533 --> 03:39:10.103
THE POINTS MADE EARLIER IS THAT

03:39:10.170 --> 03:39:10.637
WERE ATTACKING. THE WRONG

03:39:10.704 --> 03:39:13.640
TARGET. IT'S THE PRAYER THAT

03:39:13.707 --> 03:39:14.608
OTHERS HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO THAT

03:39:14.674 --> 03:39:16.042
ACTUALLY WOULD IT WOULD HAVE

03:39:16.109 --> 03:39:18.712
MEANINGFUL TRACTION TO REDUCE

03:39:18.778 --> 03:39:19.746
TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT

03:39:19.813 --> 03:39:21.681
HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE PAST.

03:39:21.748 --> 03:39:23.950
BUT OUTLAWING IN CALIFORNIA IS

03:39:24.017 --> 03:39:25.619
SIMPLY JUST GOING TO PUSH IT TO

03:39:25.685 --> 03:39:27.387
NEVADA AND ARIZONA AND

03:39:27.454 --> 03:39:29.789
ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. AND NOT

03:39:29.856 --> 03:39:32.192
TO MENTION OF COURSE THE

03:39:32.259 --> 03:39:34.060
ILLICIT TRADE WILL JUST CONVERT

03:39:34.127 --> 03:39:35.862
INTO THE BLACK MARKET TRADE SO

03:39:35.929 --> 03:39:37.998
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK

03:39:38.064 --> 03:39:39.499
THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE THE

03:39:39.566 --> 03:39:41.668
OUTCOME OF. THE PRODUCT THE

03:39:41.735 --> 03:39:43.970
PEOPLE DESIRE NGUYEN INSTEAD

03:39:44.037 --> 03:39:46.540
THE FRAMEWORK SHOULD BE ARE

03:39:46.606 --> 03:39:49.609
SUING IS THE REMEDY THAT WILL

03:39:49.676 --> 03:39:51.211
BE MOST EFFECTIVE FORCING THIS

03:39:51.278 --> 03:39:51.778
LEGISLATION. NOT PURSUE THAT

03:39:51.845 --> 03:39:55.348
REMEDY. THE USER BORDERS CENTER

03:39:55.415 --> 03:39:56.516
JONES. THANK YOU MADAM

CONCERNS ON THE BILL AND I

03:40:12.966 --> 03:40:13.500
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME

03:40:13.567 --> 03:40:15.335
EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL. BUT

03:40:15.402 --> 03:40:18.305
THAT THE- THAT THAT TESTIMONY

03:40:18.371 --> 03:40:19.739
MADE A PRETTY GOOD CASE. OF

03:40:19.806 --> 03:40:23.276
THIS BILL BEING PROPOSED BY.

03:40:23.343 --> 03:40:26.279

OTHER PEOPLE HAVE CAUGHT UP TO

THAT SOCIAL STANDING. NOW THEY

03:40:37.023 --> 03:40:39.125
WANT TO STOP ANYONE ELSE FROM

WEARING THAT FOR PRODUCT. AND

03:40:41.328 --> 03:40:42.762

INTERPRETATION IT DOES EXACTLY

04:00:20.439 --> 04:00:22.674
WHAT OUR COLLEAGUE SUGGESTS IT

FURTHER BACK BECAUSE WE'VE

04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:48.600

THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:00:55.374 --> 04:00:57.276
CHANGE THAT BY CREATING A

AND UNDERSTAND WHY VOTING IS

04:01:04.817 --> 04:01:06.084

AND WE ALL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER

04:01:29.808 --> 04:01:30.375
IN EMBARRASSMENT DIDN'T WANT TO

04:01:30.442 --> 04:01:33.445
CONFESS. WHAT A DEMOCRACY IS

04:01:33.512 --> 04:01:35.314

JUST THE ENVIRONMENT WORK

YEAR EL AS OURS WAS SENTENCED

HAPPENED OUTSIDE OF A RAP

AND A NEXUS TO GUN VIOLENCE.

04:28:41.839 --> 04:28:43.407

MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES WHEN

05:28:08.235 --> 05:28:09.136
HEARING JOHNSON WAS GOVERNOR

05:28:09.202 --> 05:28:10.737
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE

05:28:10.804 --> 05:28:11.738
DIDN'T HAVE FORTY MILLION

05:28:11.805 --> 05:28:13.273
PEOPLE LIVING HERE WE PROBABLY

05:28:13.340 --> 05:28:15.008
HAVE A LEGISLATURE THAT WAS

05:28:15.075 --> 05:28:15.509
TRULY REFLECTIVE OF THE

05:28:15.575 --> 05:28:18.412
ELECTORATE. HEY IT'S A

05:28:18.478 --> 05:28:19.913
DIFFERENT DAY WHERE IN ORDER

FOR US TO DO SOMETIMES WHAT IS

05:28:21.715 --> 05:28:24.151
RIGHTEOUS FOR THE CITIZENS OF

05:28:24.217 --> 05:28:24.785
THE STATE. WE HAVE TO GO TO THE

05:28:24.851 --> 05:28:27.587
BALLOT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT

05:28:27.654 --> 05:28:31.358
SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY VERY WILL

05:28:31.425 --> 05:28:35.295
USE ROUTE. TO ENSURE THAT

05:28:35.362 --> 05:28:38.899
CITIZENS VOICES ARE HEARD. PROP

05:28:38.965 --> 05:28:39.499
THIRTEEN WAS PASSED HOW MANY

05:28:39.566 --> 05:28:40.700
YEARS AGO THIRTY YEARS AGO AS

05:28:40.767 --> 05:28:43.770
A- AS A STATE PEOPLE WERE

05:28:43.837 --> 05:28:45.205
REBELLIOUS OVER THE HIGH

05:28:45.272 --> 05:28:48.175
PROPERTY TAXES OVER PRODUCT

05:28:48.241 --> 05:28:48.742
PRICING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR

05:28:48.809 --> 05:28:52.512
HOMES. IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL

05:28:52.579 --> 05:28:53.447
RIGHT THAT WE CAN EMPLOYEES

05:28:53.513 --> 05:28:55.582
SOMEONE TO GET SIGNATURES TO

05:28:55.649 --> 05:28:58.085
GET SOMETHING ON A BALLOT. SO

05:28:58.151 --> 05:29:00.387
THAT CAN HAVE A LAWFUL ELECTION

05:29:00.454 --> 05:29:02.022
AND BE CONSIDERED AT THE BALLOT

05:29:02.089 --> 05:29:03.890
BOX. NOW THE LEFT PROBABLY

05:29:03.957 --> 05:29:05.258
DOESN'T LIKE THAT WE USE

05:29:05.325 --> 05:29:07.227
SIGNATURE GATHERERS BECAUSE OF

05:29:07.294 --> 05:29:08.361
THE PART OF THE LEGISLATION YOU

05:29:08.428 --> 05:29:10.263
CAN HAVE NONPROFIT SECOND STEP

05:29:10.330 --> 05:29:13.066
UP TO THE PLATE. AND DO THAT

05:29:13.133 --> 05:29:14.868
MANY THOSE SAME NONPROFITS ARE

05:29:14.935 --> 05:29:16.770
BENEFICIARIES OF LEGISLATION

05:29:16.837 --> 05:29:19.506
THAT HAPPENS HERE AND THE STATE

05:29:19.573 --> 05:29:21.007
LEGISLATURE SO CREATES A LITTLE

05:29:21.074 --> 05:29:23.844
BIT OF AN IMBALANCE. AND I CAN

05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:25.345
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY THE

05:29:25.412 --> 05:29:26.580
LEGISLATURE WOULD MOVE TO TRY

05:29:26.646 --> 05:29:28.048
TO BAN THIS CONSTITUTIONAL

05:29:28.115 --> 05:29:30.417
ACTIVITY SO I THINK WE SHOULD

05:29:30.484 --> 05:29:31.818
RESERVE THE RIGHT FOR OUR

05:29:31.885 --> 05:29:33.487
CITIZENS TO CHALLENGE WHAT WE

05:29:33.553 --> 05:29:35.956
DO UP HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE

05:29:36.022 --> 05:29:38.558
THIS CONTRARY TO. HOW THEY LIKE

05:29:38.625 --> 05:29:40.227
TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

05:29:40.293 --> 05:29:43.163
RUN AND IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL TO

05:29:43.230 --> 05:29:45.232
PAY A COMPANY TO DO THE LEGWORK

05:29:45.298 --> 05:29:47.100
TO GRAB THE SIGNATURES TO GET

05:29:47.167 --> 05:29:48.568
ON THE BALLOTS ARE CITIZENS CAN

05:29:48.635 --> 05:29:52.072
VOICE THEIR OPINION ON ISSUES.

05:29:52.139 --> 05:29:53.974
BEFORE THIS STATE THAT ARE PAST

05:29:54.040 --> 05:29:55.108
ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH A

05:29:55.175 --> 05:29:56.710
MAJORITY OF THE CITIZENS AND

05:29:56.776 --> 05:30:01.848
FOR THOSE REASONS. WE SHOULD

05:30:01.915 --> 05:30:02.816
DEFINITELY SAY NO AB FOURTEEN

05:30:02.883 --> 05:30:08.355
THIRTY ONE. ANY FURTHER DEBATE

05:30:08.421 --> 05:30:09.656
OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM.

05:30:09.723 --> 05:30:13.026
SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM

05:30:13.093 --> 05:30:14.361
PRESIDENT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR

05:30:14.427 --> 05:30:15.695
THE FLOOR MANAGER IF YOU TAKE A

05:30:15.762 --> 05:30:18.798
QUESTION SENATOR HURT I WILL.

05:30:18.865 --> 05:30:20.167
PLEASE PROCEED. I AM I DON'T

05:30:20.233 --> 05:30:22.035
UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE NON

05:30:22.102 --> 05:30:24.504
PROFITS AND UNIONS EXEMPTED.

05:30:24.571 --> 05:30:25.605
ARE FROM IN THIS BILL AND COULD

05:30:25.672 --> 05:30:28.375
YOU EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE THERE

05:30:28.441 --> 05:30:28.875
IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE

05:30:28.942 --> 05:30:31.044
CONSTITUTIONALITY ABOUT. WELL I

05:30:31.111 --> 05:30:32.779
THINK IT HAS TO DO. WITH THE

05:30:32.846 --> 05:30:35.081
NATURE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THE

05:30:35.148 --> 05:30:37.517
EASE OUR EMPLOYEE BASE GROUPS.

05:30:37.584 --> 05:30:38.752
INDIVIDUALLY BASED GROUPS.

05:30:38.818 --> 05:30:40.854
MEMBERSHIP BASED GROUPS. AND I

05:30:40.921 --> 05:30:41.388
THINK THAT THERE'S IN THE

05:30:41.454 --> 05:30:43.356
CONSTITUTION THE IDEA OF THE

05:30:43.423 --> 05:30:45.258
RIGHT TO ASSOCIATION. IT IS

05:30:45.325 --> 05:30:47.060
FOUNDATIONAL IN THE BILL OF

05:30:47.127 --> 05:30:48.628
RIGHTS. SO THESE ARE MEMBERSHIP

05:30:48.695 --> 05:30:50.931
GROUPS. THAT ARE FORMED BY A

05:30:50.997 --> 05:30:52.599
COMMON SET OF IDEAS THOSE COULD

05:30:52.666 --> 05:30:54.467
BE A SOME OTHER GROUPS THAT

05:30:54.534 --> 05:30:56.303
EXIST IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD

05:30:56.369 --> 05:30:59.239
THE ESSENCE OF THIS BILL IN TWO

05:30:59.306 --> 05:30:59.806
THOUSAND I DID THE SPEAKERS

05:30:59.873 --> 05:31:01.408
COMMISSION ON INITIATIVE

05:31:01.474 --> 05:31:02.809
REFORM. AND WASN'T ABLE TO GET

05:31:02.876 --> 05:31:04.578
PUSH IT THROUGH BECAUSE WE HAD

05:31:04.644 --> 05:31:05.779
THE ENERGY CRISIS AND

05:31:05.845 --> 05:31:07.147
REDISTRICTING AND THIRTY FIVE

05:31:07.214 --> 05:31:11.084
OTHER THINGS AND TRUCKS RUNNING

05:31:11.151 --> 05:31:11.551
INTO THE BUILDING. THE

05:31:11.618 --> 05:31:15.822
DISRUPTED US A LITTLE BIT. YOU

05:31:15.889 --> 05:31:18.258
KNOW ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS WE

05:31:18.325 --> 05:31:18.858
CAME UP RECOMMENDATIONS THESE

05:31:18.925 --> 05:31:21.461
BEING SOME OF THEM. THE NUMBER

05:31:21.528 --> 05:31:22.696
OF BILLS I'VE SEEN TWENTY OF

05:31:22.762 --> 05:31:23.230
THEM AT LEAST THROUGH THE

05:31:23.296 --> 05:31:25.131
LEGISLATURE THAT TRY TO STOP

05:31:25.198 --> 05:31:27.234
AND MAKE IT ONLY VOLUNTEER IN

05:31:27.300 --> 05:31:28.835
THE LIKE BUT THIS IS A 10%

05:31:28.902 --> 05:31:30.136
PERCENT THRESHOLD IS ALMOST

05:31:30.203 --> 05:31:31.972
LIKE. PROPER LABELING THAT AT

05:31:32.038 --> 05:31:33.273
LEAST IT'S TRUTH IN LENDING IF

05:31:33.340 --> 05:31:34.107
YOU WILL THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY

05:31:34.174 --> 05:31:36.009
SOME REAL PEOPLE BEHIND THE

05:31:36.076 --> 05:31:37.944
MOVEMENT RATHER THAN AND AN

05:31:38.011 --> 05:31:40.280
INITIATIVE RATHER THAN JUST A

05:31:40.347 --> 05:31:42.382
GIGANTIC PAYCHECK A BIG BIG

05:31:42.449 --> 05:31:43.617
GIGANTIC CHECK WE'VE SEEN

05:31:43.683 --> 05:31:45.218
INITIATIVES BEING FUNDED BY ONE

05:31:45.285 --> 05:31:48.088
INDIVIDUAL THIS REQUIRES THAT

05:31:48.154 --> 05:31:49.256
AT LEAST YOU'VE GOT TO GATHER

05:31:49.322 --> 05:31:52.025
SOME THRESHOLD A QUORUM IF YOU

05:31:52.092 --> 05:31:53.693
WILL SOME LEVEL OF. THE

05:31:53.760 --> 05:31:55.262
DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY BEYOND

05:31:55.328 --> 05:31:56.997
THE NOTION OF THE CHECK AND THE

05:31:57.063 --> 05:31:59.833
UNIONS ARE NOT FOR PROFITS

05:31:59.899 --> 05:32:02.068
THEIR MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION

05:32:02.135 --> 05:32:03.203
UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL AGENDA

05:32:03.270 --> 05:32:04.337
I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT. BUT

05:32:04.404 --> 05:32:07.107
THEY'RE FUNDAMENTALLY DRIVEN BY

05:32:07.173 --> 05:32:07.974
INDIVIDUALS AND THAT'S THE

05:32:08.041 --> 05:32:10.110
DIFFERENCE AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL

05:32:10.176 --> 05:32:11.711
IN THOSE MEMBERSHIP

05:32:11.778 --> 05:32:13.413

05:32:20.787 --> 05:32:25.992
THAT. IS THE RIGHT TO

ASSOCIATION THAT'S WHY THEY'RE

05:32:26.660 --> 05:32:34.334
INCLUDED. BEN RESIN ON MY OWN

05:32:34.401 --> 05:32:35.435
TIME I JUST LIKE TO REFER TO

05:32:35.502 --> 05:32:37.103
SOMETHING IN THE ANALYSIS THAT

05:32:37.170 --> 05:32:38.305
I THINK GOES TO THE HEART OF

05:32:38.371 --> 05:32:40.640
THE QUESTION REGARDING. HI

05:32:40.707 --> 05:32:43.943
EQUAL ACCESS SAYS THE PROVIDED

05:32:44.010 --> 05:32:47.013
IN THE CONSTITUTION. I'D LIKE

05:32:47.080 --> 05:32:52.452
TO READ I MIGHT. VOLUNTEERS

05:32:52.519 --> 05:32:54.754
THIS MAY BILL MAY ALSO VIOLATE

05:32:54.821 --> 05:32:55.755
THE EQUAL PROTECTION AS

05:32:55.822 --> 05:32:57.624
IDEOLOGICALLY EXAMS UNIONS AND

05:32:57.691 --> 05:32:59.359
OTHER NON PROFITS FROM THIS

05:32:59.426 --> 05:33:00.860
REQUIREMENT. AND EVEN ALLOWS

05:33:00.927 --> 05:33:02.595
ARE PAID CIRCULATORS TO USE

05:33:02.662 --> 05:33:04.331
PETITIONS STATING THAT THEY ARE

05:33:04.397 --> 05:33:05.632
NOT BEING PAID TO CIRCULATE

05:33:05.699 --> 05:33:07.400
PETITIONS. I THINK THE POINT

05:33:07.467 --> 05:33:09.803
HERE IS THAT YOU CAN HELP. MANY

05:33:09.869 --> 05:33:11.504
ORGANIZATIONS AND I'D LIKE TO

05:33:11.571 --> 05:33:12.605
REFER TO ONE THAT HAPPENED IN

05:33:12.672 --> 05:33:14.307
LAGUNA MIGUEL FOR MANY YEARS WE

05:33:14.374 --> 05:33:15.975
FIND AN AIRPORT WAS ABOUT TEN

05:33:16.042 --> 05:33:18.311
YEARS. AND WE HAD TO FILE OF

05:33:18.378 --> 05:33:20.980
PETITIONS FOR BALLOT MEASURES

05:33:21.047 --> 05:33:22.816
THAT WOULD STOP THAT WE USED

05:33:22.882 --> 05:33:24.784
PAID WE HAD MANY VOLUNTEERS WE

05:33:24.851 --> 05:33:26.586
YOU'D PAID CIRCULATORS BUT WE

05:33:26.653 --> 05:33:28.154
ARE ALSO A NONPROFIT. SO

05:33:28.221 --> 05:33:30.123
BASICALLY YOU COULD HAVE AN

05:33:30.190 --> 05:33:33.193
EMPLOYER WHO HAS A PARTICULAR

05:33:33.259 --> 05:33:35.762
INITIATIVE THAT ARE A BILL IS

05:33:35.829 --> 05:33:38.164
COMING OUT TOMORROW. ASIAN

05:33:38.231 --> 05:33:39.199
THAT'S COMING OUT THEM SO THEY

05:33:39.265 --> 05:33:39.833
CAN ACTUALLY FORM A NONPROFIT

05:33:39.899 --> 05:33:40.633
SAY THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES OR

05:33:40.700 --> 05:33:42.168
MEMBERS BECAUSE IT AFFECTS ALL

05:33:42.235 --> 05:33:43.069
OF THEM AND THEN THEY WOULD BE

05:33:43.136 --> 05:33:45.071
EXEMPTED TO I ASSUME. IT SEEMS

05:33:45.138 --> 05:33:47.807

05:33:47.874 --> 05:33:49.442

GOVERNMENTS IN THE LAWS THAT

05:41:47.019 --> 05:41:48.654
SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THE

A MEASURE I PRESENTED YOU

05:45:22.068 --> 05:45:24.637
EARLIER TODAY REGARDING.

05:45:24.703 --> 05:45:26.839
BASICALLY AN INSURANCE POLICY

05:45:26.906 --> 05:45:29.041
TO MAKE SURE THAT TAXPAYERS ARE

05:45:29.108 --> 05:45:32.812
NOT STUCK WITH THE DIME IF NO

05:45:32.878 --> 05:45:33.813
OIL OR GAS COMPANY GOES

05:45:33.879 --> 05:45:36.549
BANKRUPT. FOR THE COSTA

05:45:36.615 --> 05:45:37.917
PLUGGING IN ABANDONING THEIR

05:45:37.983 --> 05:45:41.387
WELLS ALREADY THE TAB HAS RUN

05:45:41.454 --> 05:45:44.023
OUT ON ON HOLLY PLATFORM WHICH

05:45:44.090 --> 05:45:45.958
WAS A FORMER EXXON SITE THAT

05:45:46.025 --> 05:45:48.060
WAS THEN SOLD TO VAN ECHO

05:45:48.127 --> 05:45:50.463
INVENTED CO WENT BANKRUPT AND

05:45:50.529 --> 05:45:53.299
THE BILL I BELIEVE IS OVER A

05:45:53.365 --> 05:45:53.933
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT THIS

05:45:53.999 --> 05:45:55.935
POINT. TWO HUNDRED. THIS BILL

05:45:56.001 --> 05:45:58.871
DOES NOT CAP THE LIABILITIES

05:45:58.938 --> 05:46:00.206
FOR OIL COMPANIES ON THE BACK

05:46:00.272 --> 05:46:01.507
END OF WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

05:46:01.574 --> 05:46:02.641
DO WHEN IT COMES TO REAP

05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:04.043
REMEDIATION OR DE

05:46:04.110 --> 05:46:06.145
COMMISSIONING. SO MAKE NO

05:46:06.212 --> 05:46:07.913
MISTAKE THIS IS NOT A FREE PASS

05:46:07.980 --> 05:46:11.283
TO OIL. BUT IT DOES REQUIRE

05:46:11.350 --> 05:46:12.518
OPERATORS IN THIS STATE TO HAVE

05:46:12.585 --> 05:46:14.687
SOME SKIN IN THE GAME. TO SAY

05:46:14.753 --> 05:46:16.188
THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT UP SOME

05:46:16.255 --> 05:46:19.058
REASONABLE COST OF PLUGGING IN

05:46:19.125 --> 05:46:20.526
ABANDONING THAT WELL OR THOSE

05:46:20.593 --> 05:46:23.596
WELLS. PRIOR TO WORKING THOSE

05:46:23.662 --> 05:46:26.832
WELLS. THE COSTS ARE CAPPED A

05:46:26.899 --> 05:46:28.934
RIGHT NOW FOR THAT REQUIREMENT

05:46:29.001 --> 05:46:31.670
IT'S THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS.

05:46:31.737 --> 05:46:33.873
FOR THE REASONABLE COSTS OF

05:46:33.939 --> 05:46:34.373
PLUGGING IN ABANDONMENT

05:46:34.440 --> 05:46:37.076
WHICHEVER IS LESS. SO WE THINK

05:46:37.143 --> 05:46:39.078
IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE

05:46:39.145 --> 05:46:39.578
MEASURE BUT THERE'S ALSO

05:46:39.645 --> 05:46:40.112
ANOTHER COMPONENT THAT YOU

05:46:40.179 --> 05:46:43.449
SHOULD KNOW. THE GOVERNOR WAIT

05:46:43.516 --> 05:46:45.751
IN. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO IN THE

05:46:45.818 --> 05:46:48.387
PROCESS AND IN LIGHT OF SOME OF

05:46:48.454 --> 05:46:49.188
THE CHALLENGES WE'VE BEEN

05:46:49.255 --> 05:46:52.491
FACING A DOG OR- WHETHER IT'S

05:46:52.558 --> 05:46:55.628
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. OR DEMI

05:46:55.694 --> 05:46:56.662
PERMITS THAT HAVE MADE THEIR

05:46:56.729 --> 05:46:59.198
WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM. FOR A

05:46:59.265 --> 05:47:02.334
GENERAL GENERAL. FRUSTRATION

05:47:02.401 --> 05:47:03.502
BOTH FROM INDUSTRY AND FROM

05:47:03.569 --> 05:47:06.005
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WITH THEIR

05:47:06.071 --> 05:47:08.974
ABILITY TO DO PROPER OVERSIGHT

05:47:09.041 --> 05:47:10.276
AND PERMITTING IN THE OIL AND

05:47:10.342 --> 05:47:12.978
GAS INDUSTRY. CHANGES ARE BEING

05:47:13.045 --> 05:47:14.446
MADE AND AN OVERALL WILL BE

05:47:14.513 --> 05:47:17.583
UNDER WAY. THIS FALL AND INTO

05:47:17.650 --> 05:47:20.152
NEXT YEAR. ENTITIES KICK OFF

05:47:20.219 --> 05:47:23.889
THAT PROCESS THE GOVERNOR

05:47:23.956 --> 05:47:24.423
PROPOSED A RENAMING OF THE

05:47:24.490 --> 05:47:27.359
AGENCY. I BELIEVE THE ACRONYM

05:47:27.426 --> 05:47:29.495
NOW WILL BE CAL JAM. BUT IT

05:47:29.562 --> 05:47:32.498
WILL BE THE GEOLOGIC ENERGY

05:47:32.565 --> 05:47:33.098
MANAGEMENT DIVISION WITHIN THE

05:47:33.165 --> 05:47:36.669
RESOURCES AGENCY. BUT ALSO IT

05:47:36.735 --> 05:47:38.404
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE

05:47:38.470 --> 05:47:39.705
MISSION IS BEING CLARIFIED IN

05:47:39.772 --> 05:47:42.441
THIS LEGISLATION. TO MAKE CLEAR

05:47:42.508 --> 05:47:45.711
THAT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY.

05:47:45.778 --> 05:47:46.212
THAT ALIGNMENT WITH OUR

05:47:46.278 --> 05:47:49.048
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. IS A

05:47:49.114 --> 05:47:49.648
CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE WORK

05:47:49.715 --> 05:47:53.252
THAT. THE FORMER DOGGER HAS TO

05:47:53.319 --> 05:47:54.987
DO THAT THEY'RE NOT ON AN

05:47:55.054 --> 05:47:56.555
ISLAND THAT THEY MUST

05:47:56.622 --> 05:47:58.524
COORDINATE WITH OTHER AGENCIES

05:47:58.591 --> 05:47:59.425
IN THEM PLAN IMPLEMENTATION A

05:47:59.491 --> 05:48:01.727
STATE POLICY. SO LOOK FORWARD

05:48:01.794 --> 05:48:02.561
TO THE DISCUSSION I KNOW THAT

05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:05.197
THERE'S SENSITIVITIES

05:48:05.264 --> 05:48:06.966
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO

05:48:07.032 --> 05:48:09.301
OPERATE IN IN CERTAIN AREAS

05:48:09.368 --> 05:48:10.269
WITH SMALLER INDEPENDENT

05:48:10.336 --> 05:48:12.771
OPERATORS. BUT THE INTENT OF

05:48:12.838 --> 05:48:15.674
THIS BILL IS NOT TO PUT ANY

05:48:15.741 --> 05:48:16.242
INDEPENDENT OPERATOR IN THE

05:48:16.308 --> 05:48:18.077
STATE OUT OF BUSINESS. THE

05:48:18.143 --> 05:48:19.778
REASONABLE COSTS A PLUGIN IN

05:48:19.845 --> 05:48:22.948
BANNING A WELL THOUGH. SHOULD

05:48:23.015 --> 05:48:25.517
BE REQUIRED AS SOME KIND OF

05:48:25.584 --> 05:48:26.085
SECURITY SO THAT WHEN THESE

05:48:26.151 --> 05:48:30.656
COMPANIES. DECIDE TO CHANGE

05:48:30.723 --> 05:48:33.592
COURSE LIKE GRECO JUST DID WHEN

05:48:33.659 --> 05:48:35.461
THEY WENT BANKRUPT OR LIKE VENN

05:48:35.527 --> 05:48:37.263
ECHO DID WHEN THEY LEFT THE

05:48:37.329 --> 05:48:39.231
HALL THE PLATFORM BEHIND THE

05:48:39.298 --> 05:48:42.134
TAXPAYERS WILL GET STUCK WITH

05:48:42.201 --> 05:48:42.735
THE TAP. SO THAT RESPECTFULLY

05:48:42.801 --> 05:48:46.672
ASK DR. THANK YOU CENTER STERN

05:48:46.739 --> 05:48:48.040

05:48:52.278 --> 05:48:54.947
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I

05:48:55.014 --> 05:48:56.048
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY ON

05:48:56.115 --> 05:48:58.684
THE FLOOR EXCEPT FOR MYSELF AND-MY COLLEAGUE FROM KERN COUNTY

05:48:58.751 --> 05:49:01.253

05:49:05.858 --> 05:49:09.962
C. AN ERA. BERRY IS NOW PART OF

05:49:10.029 --> 05:49:10.462
THAT WHICH REPRESENT AN

05:49:10.529 --> 05:49:12.398
ORGANIZATION CALLED WITH CPAP.

05:49:12.464 --> 05:49:15.601
AND WE ALSO REPRESENT ALMOST

05:49:15.668 --> 05:49:16.201
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT SMALL

BY THE OR THE I. O. PA OF

05:49:19.138 --> 05:49:21.140
INDEPENDENCE. SO I KNOW THAT

05:49:21.206 --> 05:49:22.508
SOME OF YOU HAVE EITHER THE

05:49:22.574 --> 05:49:24.310
MAJORS OR SOME OF THE SMALL

05:49:24.376 --> 05:49:25.911
ONES BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

05:49:25.978 --> 05:49:26.945

05:49:27.012 --> 05:49:28.247
FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

05:49:28.314 --> 05:49:32.618
REPRESENT BOTH ENTITIES SO THIS

05:49:32.685 --> 05:49:35.721
IS A HARD DEBATE TO SPEAK OUT

05:49:35.788 --> 05:49:38.357
ABOUT IN THIS BILL IS BECAUSE-

05:49:38.424 --> 05:49:41.026

ORGANIZATION. EVERYTHING ELSE

05:49:58.977 --> 05:50:00.079
PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION

05:50:00.145 --> 05:50:01.613

CONSIDERED BIG OIL. AND THESE

05:50:21.867 --> 05:50:23.068
OIL COMPANIES THAT ARE

05:50:23.135 --> 05:50:24.370
CONSIDERED WHAT WE WOULD CALL

05:50:24.436 --> 05:50:26.472
OR YOU RECALL BIG OIL ON THESE

05:50:26.538 --> 05:50:28.707
COMPANIES HAVE OVER TEN

05:50:28.774 --> 05:50:30.376
THOUSAND WELLS EACH THAT THEY

05:50:30.442 --> 05:50:32.177
OPERATE IT'S MUCH IT'S HIGHER

05:50:32.244 --> 05:50:33.779
THAN THAT BUT YOU CAN

05:50:33.846 --> 05:50:37.049
DEFINITELY SAY IT'S OVER TEN

05:50:37.116 --> 05:50:37.649
THOUSAND WHEELS WITH DECEPTION

05:50:37.716 --> 05:50:38.150
TO BURY THEIR ABOUT SIX

05:50:38.217 --> 05:50:41.587
THOUSAND MILES. THOSE ARE THE

05:50:41.653 --> 05:50:42.287
WHISPER MEMBERS IN THE HOUSE

05:50:42.354 --> 05:50:42.788
MEMBERS ARE THE SMALLER

05:50:42.855 --> 05:50:44.723
OPERATORS. AND WHAT REALLY

05:50:44.790 --> 05:50:45.991
FRUSTRATES ME ABOUT THIS PIECE

05:50:46.058 --> 05:50:47.292
OF LEGISLATION IS AT THE

05:50:47.359 --> 05:50:49.895
SMALLER OPERATORS WERE CUT OUT

05:50:49.962 --> 05:50:50.462
OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

05:50:50.529 --> 05:50:53.465
AND A DEAL. I UNDERSTAND LET ME

05:50:53.532 --> 05:50:55.100
SAY THAT Y. WHISPER MEMBERS

05:50:55.167 --> 05:50:59.037
MADE THE DEAL. THE EXPOSURE FOR

05:50:59.104 --> 05:51:01.006
PUTTING THAT MONEY FOR EVERY

05:51:01.073 --> 05:51:02.608
WELL THAT YOU HAVE WITH THE

05:51:02.674 --> 05:51:04.009
VOLUME OF WELLS THAT ARE

05:51:04.076 --> 05:51:05.978
WHISPER MEMBERS HAVE AGAIN JOB

05:51:06.044 --> 05:51:08.447
CREATORS IN MY DISTRICT. THE

05:51:08.514 --> 05:51:09.948
EXPOSURE THAT THEY HAVE IF YOU

05:51:10.015 --> 05:51:11.583
CALCULATE IT FIVE HUNDRED

05:51:11.650 --> 05:51:12.951
THOUSAND OR SKEWS ME A FIVE

05:51:13.018 --> 05:51:13.519
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

05:51:13.585 --> 05:51:14.686
ENSURE CAP ON A WELL WHICH IS

05:51:14.753 --> 05:51:16.355
THE ESTIMATE THE NUMBER'S BEEN

05:51:16.422 --> 05:51:19.224
FLOATING AROUND THAT'S A SIX

05:51:19.291 --> 05:51:22.027
BILLION DOLLAR. EXPOSURE TWO

05:51:22.094 --> 05:51:23.929
ONE COMPANY AND THAT'S PRETTY

05:51:23.996 --> 05:51:27.299
SCARY. SO I GET WHY THEY WANTED

05:51:27.366 --> 05:51:29.034
A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR CAP I

05:51:29.101 --> 05:51:31.236
GET IT. IT MAKES SENSE FOR

05:51:31.303 --> 05:51:33.505
THEM. BUT FOR A SMALL GUY THAT

05:51:33.572 --> 05:51:35.874
HAS TO PUT UP. ALMOST THIRTY

05:51:35.941 --> 05:51:38.043
MILLION DOLLARS BUT THAT AGAIN

05:51:38.110 --> 05:51:39.244
THE BILL DOES SOME DISCRETION

05:51:39.311 --> 05:51:41.246
THAT DOG CAN HAVE THE

05:51:41.313 --> 05:51:43.248
DISCRETION OF THAT PIECE OF

05:51:43.315 --> 05:51:45.851
THAT OF THAT. UP TO THIRTY

05:51:45.918 --> 05:51:47.085
MILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S NOT TO

05:51:47.152 --> 05:51:48.554
SAY THAT BRACKEN WOULD HAVE TO

05:51:48.620 --> 05:51:50.022
PAY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IT'S

05:51:50.088 --> 05:51:50.856
GOING TO BE A DOCTOR'S

05:51:50.923 --> 05:51:52.925
DISCRETION. AND THEY ARE

05:51:52.991 --> 05:51:54.493
SUPPOSED TO UNDER THE LANGUAGE

05:51:54.560 --> 05:51:56.829
TO THE LESSER OF THE TWO. WHAT

05:51:56.895 --> 05:51:59.665
IS AFFORDABLE AND WHAT IS THE

05:51:59.731 --> 05:52:02.301
THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR CAP.

05:52:02.367 --> 05:52:03.569
SMALL PRODUCERS LIKE I SAID

05:52:03.635 --> 05:52:05.137
THAT HAVE YOU KNOW FIVE AND TEN

05:52:05.204 --> 05:52:07.206
WELLS. LIKE RUNNY BRACKET THAT

05:52:07.272 --> 05:52:10.008
I JUST TALKED ABOUT FOR EIGHTY

05:52:10.075 --> 05:52:10.609
HE'S EIGHTY YEARS OLD HE'S GOT

05:52:10.676 --> 05:52:11.176
OUT CHECKED AS WELL AS EVERY

05:52:11.243 --> 05:52:13.879
SINGLE DAY. AND FOR HIM QUALIFY

05:52:13.946 --> 05:52:15.547
FOR THIS IT WOULD PAY TAKE HIM

05:52:15.614 --> 05:52:17.316
YEARS TO PUT AT THAT TYPE OF

05:52:17.382 --> 05:52:19.551
REVENUE. I AGREE WITH MY

05:52:19.618 --> 05:52:20.953
COLLEAGUES THAT WE NEED TO GO

05:52:21.019 --> 05:52:23.188
AFTER BAD ACTORS THE ONE TO

05:52:23.255 --> 05:52:24.756
ABANDON THESE WELLS. MY

05:52:24.823 --> 05:52:25.757
COLLEAGUE FROM VENTURE THAT

05:52:25.824 --> 05:52:27.226
SAID THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN

05:52:27.292 --> 05:52:28.760
MY MIND THERE ARE SOME BAD

05:52:28.827 --> 05:52:29.761
OPERATORS OUT THERE AND I

05:52:29.828 --> 05:52:31.463
AGREED. THAT WE SHOULD GO AFTER

05:52:31.530 --> 05:52:32.464
THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY

05:52:32.531 --> 05:52:33.999
ARE COMPLYING WITH THAT. AND

05:52:34.066 --> 05:52:36.068
THE TAXPAYER SHOULD NOT BE ON

05:52:36.134 --> 05:52:37.569
THE HOOK. BUT THIS BILL IS NOT

05:52:37.636 --> 05:52:40.606
THE ANSWER. THIS BILL HURTS OUR

05:52:40.672 --> 05:52:42.474
SMALL OPERATORS AND IT ONLY

05:52:42.541 --> 05:52:44.943
BUYS MAYBE A YEAR. FOR OUR

05:52:45.010 --> 05:52:46.512
LARGE OPERATORS WHEN THAT C. C.

05:52:46.578 --> 05:52:48.847
S. T. REPORT COMES OUT. AND IT

05:52:48.914 --> 05:52:50.082
ESTIMATES THE COST OF PLUGGING

05:52:50.148 --> 05:52:51.783
IN ABANDONED WELLS IN UPWARDS

05:52:51.850 --> 05:52:54.653
OF THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

05:52:54.720 --> 05:52:55.687
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN

05:52:55.754 --> 05:52:57.623
THE ORPHAN WILL FIND TO BE ABLE

05:52:57.689 --> 05:52:59.892
TO SECURE. THAT TYPE OF

05:52:59.958 --> 05:53:02.027
LIABILITY AND I GET IT BUT

05:53:02.094 --> 05:53:04.329
THAT'S PARTIALLY OIL AND OUR

05:53:04.396 --> 05:53:06.798
FAULT AS LEGISLATORS. IN THE

05:53:06.865 --> 05:53:08.700
HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA OTHER

05:53:08.767 --> 05:53:11.336
THAN THE DA'S WILLIAMS BILL A

05:53:11.403 --> 05:53:12.504
COUPLE OF YEARS. FORGIVE ME

05:53:12.571 --> 05:53:13.071
BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER THE

05:53:13.138 --> 05:53:14.239
NUMBER. THAT WOULD ONLY BE

05:53:14.306 --> 05:53:16.875
REQUIRED OPERATOR TO GO BACK

05:53:16.942 --> 05:53:18.043
FLOOD OR DRESS ABANDONED OR

05:53:18.110 --> 05:53:20.379
ORPHANED WHAT ELSE. THAT

05:53:20.445 --> 05:53:21.413
PARTICULAR PIECE OF

05:53:21.480 --> 05:53:24.216
LEGISLATION. AFFECTED ORPHANED

05:53:24.283 --> 05:53:26.218
AND ABANDONED WELLS WITH

05:53:26.285 --> 05:53:30.522
COLLEAGUES WHEN PEOPLE. STARTED

05:53:30.589 --> 05:53:31.123
LOOKING AT THIS ABANDONED WELL

05:53:31.189 --> 05:53:36.028
PROCESS. WELLS IN THIS STATE

05:53:36.094 --> 05:53:36.828
THE WERE ORPHANED OR ABANDONED

05:53:36.895 --> 05:53:38.163
SINCE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE. SO

05:53:38.230 --> 05:53:39.464
TO REQUIRE SO THINK ABOUT THIS

05:53:39.531 --> 05:53:40.399
TO REQUIRE OIL COMPANIES. TO

05:53:40.465 --> 05:53:41.300
IMMEDIATELY ELIMINATE ALL THESE

05:53:41.366 --> 05:53:42.000
ABANDONED WELLS THAT ARE OUT

05:53:42.067 --> 05:53:43.769
THERE. THE COST NUMBER ONE IS

05:53:43.835 --> 05:53:44.870
ANSWER ASTRONOMICAL AND

05:53:44.937 --> 05:53:47.406
SUSTAINABLE. IT NEEDS TO BE A

05:53:47.472 --> 05:53:48.674
PROCESS IN ORDER TO ABANDON

05:53:48.740 --> 05:53:50.776
THESE IDA WELLS. BECAUSE YOU

05:53:50.842 --> 05:53:52.711
COULD EVEN FOR EVERY OIL WORKER

05:53:52.778 --> 05:53:54.346
I BET YOU I BET AND I DON'T

05:53:54.413 --> 05:53:55.914
HAVE ANY STUDY TO PROVE IT BUT

05:53:55.981 --> 05:53:57.382
BASED ON THE INDUSTRY AND BASS

05:53:57.449 --> 05:53:58.517
WHAT I KNOW. AND HOW LONG IT

05:53:58.584 --> 05:54:00.719
TAKES IN THE PROCESS. I BET YOU

05:54:00.786 --> 05:54:02.654
CAN EMPLOY ALMOST EVERY IF NOT

05:54:02.721 --> 05:54:04.623
EVERY OIL WORKER WORKING SEVEN

05:54:04.690 --> 05:54:06.425
NAY DOUBT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK

05:54:06.491 --> 05:54:07.559
TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. FOR

05:54:07.626 --> 05:54:11.897
THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND STILL.

05:54:11.964 --> 05:54:12.364
NOT BE ABLE TO PLUG OR

05:54:12.431 --> 05:54:16.101
ABANDONED ALL OF THESE WELLS. I

05:54:16.168 --> 05:54:16.635
REALIZE THAT THERE IS A

05:54:16.702 --> 05:54:17.869
PROBLEM. BUT THIS BILL IS NOT

05:54:17.936 --> 05:54:18.403
THE WAY TO ADDRESS THIS

05:54:18.470 --> 05:54:20.672
PROBLEM. HOWARD K. WOULD IN MY

05:54:20.739 --> 05:54:23.041
DISTRICT AND IN MY- ACTUALLY WE

05:54:23.108 --> 05:54:25.177
SHARED THAT AREA. WITH MY

05:54:25.243 --> 05:54:26.411
COLLEAGUES FROM THE CENTRAL

05:54:26.478 --> 05:54:29.147
VALLEY HIS TEN WELLS. TEN WELLS

05:54:29.214 --> 05:54:30.882
AND HE'S GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO

05:54:30.949 --> 05:54:34.019
UP TO. A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR

05:54:34.086 --> 05:54:38.991
BONDING. RIGHT NOW HE PAYS

05:54:39.057 --> 05:54:39.758
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

05:54:39.825 --> 05:54:43.695
SO. IT'S A TREMENDOUS REACH TO

05:54:43.762 --> 05:54:45.497
THINK THAT ANY COMPANY IS GOING

05:54:45.564 --> 05:54:47.933
TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB THESE COST.

05:54:48.000 --> 05:54:49.668
SO EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS TO

05:54:49.735 --> 05:54:52.604
MITIGATE DOWN THESE COST IF

05:54:52.671 --> 05:54:53.238
THEY APPLY FOR THIS AND

05:54:53.305 --> 05:54:56.008
DAUGHTER ON THE NEW DIVISION.

05:54:56.074 --> 05:54:57.542
ISSUES ASK THEM TO MITIGATE

05:54:57.609 --> 05:54:59.311
DOWN THEIR COST YOU HAVE TO

05:54:59.378 --> 05:55:00.245
THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

05:55:00.312 --> 05:55:02.147
THROWING AROUND AS THIS NUMBER

05:55:02.214 --> 05:55:02.748
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

05:55:02.814 --> 05:55:03.715
THEY'D HAVE TO MITIGATE THEIR

05:55:03.782 --> 05:55:08.020
COST BY 90% TO EVEN COME UNDER

05:55:08.086 --> 05:55:08.553
THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR

05:55:08.620 --> 05:55:11.189
THRESHOLD. WHEN YOU LOOK AT

05:55:11.256 --> 05:55:12.691
THAT THAT'S ABOUT SIXTY WELLS

05:55:12.758 --> 05:55:14.793
SO ANYBODY ABOVE SIXTY WELLS IS

05:55:14.860 --> 05:55:16.128
GOING TO BE AT THAT THIRTY

05:55:16.194 --> 05:55:16.895
MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD

05:55:16.962 --> 05:55:19.431
EXCEPT. SOME OF THE ONES THAT

05:55:19.498 --> 05:55:20.832
ARE IN THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

05:55:20.899 --> 05:55:21.767
RANGING THINGS BUT THE MOST

05:55:21.833 --> 05:55:24.302
PROTECTION IT'S OFFERED IN THIS

05:55:24.369 --> 05:55:24.770
BILL IS FOR THE LARGE

05:55:24.836 --> 05:55:27.172
OPERATORS. AND I. THIS IS A

05:55:27.239 --> 05:55:28.573
HARD BILL LIKE I SAID BECAUSE I

05:55:28.640 --> 05:55:30.242
HAVE LARGE OPERATORS IN MY

05:55:30.308 --> 05:55:32.611
DISTRICT THAT PROVIDE JOBS. BUT

05:55:32.678 --> 05:55:34.846
MY PROBLEM IS THAT THE SMALLER

05:55:34.913 --> 05:55:35.447
OPERATORS WERE CUT OUT OF THIS

05:55:35.514 --> 05:55:39.351
DEAL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. LIKE

05:55:39.418 --> 05:55:40.919
I SAID THE ESTIMATES IT'S

05:55:40.986 --> 05:55:42.154
ROUGHLY ABOUT SIX BILLION

05:55:42.220 --> 05:55:44.423
DOLLARS IF YOU MULTIPLY TWELVE

05:55:44.489 --> 05:55:44.890
THOUSAND MILES FOR ONE

05:55:44.956 --> 05:55:45.924
ORGANIZATION HERE IN THIS

05:55:45.991 --> 05:55:48.493
STATE. AND YOU APPLY A FIVE

05:55:48.560 --> 05:55:48.994
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR

05:55:49.061 --> 05:55:50.662
ESTIMATE FOR COSTS TO BE. TO

05:55:50.729 --> 05:55:52.264
ABANDON A WELL WHICH IS A

05:55:52.330 --> 05:55:53.298
NUMBER THAT'S BEING THROWN

05:55:53.365 --> 05:55:55.734
AROUND. AGAIN THAT SIX BILLION

05:55:55.801 --> 05:55:58.770
DOLLARS. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT

05:55:58.837 --> 05:56:00.138
WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND I'M

05:56:00.205 --> 05:56:01.673
WILLING TO WORK ON A SOLUTION

05:56:01.740 --> 05:56:03.375
FOR PROBLEM BECAUSE- AND I KNOW

05:56:03.442 --> 05:56:05.577
MY COLLEAGUE IS AS WELL A

05:56:05.644 --> 05:56:06.978
SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM. TO THE

05:56:07.045 --> 05:56:09.448
FIX THIS PROBLEM. BUT WE HAVE

05:56:09.514 --> 05:56:11.283
TO FIX IT APPROPRIATELY AND

05:56:11.349 --> 05:56:13.485
THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER THIS

05:56:13.552 --> 05:56:15.954
BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER. AND SO

05:56:16.021 --> 05:56:17.456
I'M ASKING YOU GUYS TO PLEASE

05:56:17.522 --> 05:56:19.591
VOTE NO. OR OBSCENE SO THAT WE

05:56:19.658 --> 05:56:21.426
CAN WORK TOGETHER ON A REAL

05:56:21.493 --> 05:56:22.761
SOLUTION. AND I GIVE YOU MY

05:56:22.828 --> 05:56:25.030
WORD OF SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENT

05:56:25.097 --> 05:56:28.633
75% OF THE STATE'S OIL. WE WILL

05:56:28.700 --> 05:56:29.234
COME UP WITH A GOOD SOLUTION.

05:56:29.301 --> 05:56:32.537
THAT DOES NOT. SHUT DOWN THE

05:56:32.604 --> 05:56:33.572
OIL INDUSTRY MUCH LESS THE

05:56:33.638 --> 05:56:35.941
SMALL OPERATORS AND I ALSO TELL

05:56:36.007 --> 05:56:42.848
YOU THAT. IT'S GONNA HURT

05:56:42.914 --> 05:56:45.484
WORKERS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT.

05:56:45.550 --> 05:56:47.052
WHEN I DRIVE DOWN SIXTY FIVE ON

05:56:47.119 --> 05:56:49.721
MY WAY HOME I PASSED JERRY

05:56:49.788 --> 05:56:51.623
JERRY IS A GUY THAT WENT TO

05:56:51.690 --> 05:56:53.325
FULL SOME PRISM HE'S GOT A

05:56:53.391 --> 05:56:54.493
TATTOO ON HIS HEAD THAT THE

05:56:54.559 --> 05:56:55.827
TARGET HE'S GOT TO DROP SENATE

05:56:55.894 --> 05:56:57.696
SIGN IS AND NOW HE'S THE PTA

05:56:57.763 --> 05:57:00.565
PRESIDENT FOR A SEVENTH GRADER

05:57:00.632 --> 05:57:01.133
OR SEVEN YEAR OLD. IN FIRST

05:57:01.199 --> 05:57:03.368
GRADE. THE OIL INDUSTRY CHANGES

05:57:03.435 --> 05:57:05.203
PEOPLE'S LIVES THEY PROVIDE

05:57:05.270 --> 05:57:07.639
JOBS TO SECOND CANCERS. TWO

05:57:07.706 --> 05:57:10.342
WOMEN TO VETERANS. TO UNION

05:57:10.408 --> 05:57:13.445
WORKERS. AND SO WE HAVE TO

05:57:13.512 --> 05:57:16.448
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO. WORK ON

05:57:16.515 --> 05:57:17.883
THIS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN

05:57:17.949 --> 05:57:19.484
THIS STATE WITHOUT SHUTTING

05:57:19.551 --> 05:57:21.553
DOWN THE INDUSTRY AND THIS BILL

05:57:21.620 --> 05:57:22.988
FRANKLY STARTS WITH SHUTTING

05:57:23.054 --> 05:57:23.622
DOWN THE SMALL OPERATORS

05:57:23.688 --> 05:57:26.158
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT

05:57:26.224 --> 05:57:27.759
KIND OF LIMIT YOU HAVE IF THE

05:57:27.826 --> 05:57:29.928
LIMIT IS TOO HIGH TO ATTAIN YOU

05:57:29.995 --> 05:57:32.831
CAN'T MAKE IT SO IF YOU'RE TEN

05:57:32.898 --> 05:57:34.299
MILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION

05:57:34.366 --> 05:57:34.866
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

05:57:34.933 --> 05:57:36.134
BOND FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

05:57:36.201 --> 05:57:38.470
AT THE CAP EVEN IF YOU COULD.

05:57:38.537 --> 05:57:40.238
SO I WOULD ASK YOU FOR A NO

05:57:40.305 --> 05:57:43.074
VOTE SO WE CAN PROVIDE A- A

05:57:43.141 --> 05:57:44.843
GOOD SOLUTION AND I REALIZE

05:57:44.910 --> 05:57:46.645
RENDERED AGAIN BECAUSE AT CCS

05:57:46.711 --> 05:57:48.313
HE REPORT IS COMING OUT AND I

05:57:48.380 --> 05:57:49.781
REALIZE THERE'S A PROBLEM IS

05:57:49.848 --> 05:57:51.049
STATE WITH IDLE AND ABANDON AN

05:57:51.116 --> 05:57:53.018
ORPHAN WELLS. BUT LET'S FIX IT

05:57:53.084 --> 05:57:54.653
RIGHT AND NOT AN INDIE JERK

05:57:54.719 --> 05:57:57.422
REACTION TO WOULD SATISFY A

05:57:57.489 --> 05:57:58.857
POLITICAL LEFT I ASK YOUR NO

05:57:58.924 --> 05:58:00.592
VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GROCER

05:58:00.659 --> 05:58:02.894
JACKSON THANK YOU SO LET'S TALK

05:58:02.961 --> 05:58:05.330
ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT

05:58:05.397 --> 05:58:06.998
DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY

05:58:07.065 --> 05:58:09.134
OF A GUY WAS IMPRISONED TO RUN

05:58:09.201 --> 05:58:13.004
A. OR PARTICIPATE IN THE OIL

05:58:13.071 --> 05:58:13.605
INDUSTRY HERE'S WHAT THIS BILL

05:58:13.672 --> 05:58:18.743
DOES. WHEN OIL COMPANIES FINISH

05:58:18.810 --> 05:58:21.079
DIGGING OIL. AND THEY ABANDONED

05:58:21.146 --> 05:58:23.748
THEIR WELLS. THE QUESTION IS

05:58:23.815 --> 05:58:24.316
WHO IS LEFT CLEANING UP THE

05:58:24.382 --> 05:58:28.386
MESS. WHAT IS HAPPENING AND

05:58:28.453 --> 05:58:30.789
WE'VE SEEN THIS IS A RESULT OF

05:58:30.856 --> 05:58:31.356
THE OFFSHORE WELLS IT IS THE

05:58:31.423 --> 05:58:34.893
TAXPAYER. WHO ENDS UP CLEANING

05:58:34.960 --> 05:58:38.663
UP THE MESS SO LET ME SHARE

05:58:38.730 --> 05:58:40.632
WITH YOU AS WAS INDICATED BY

05:58:40.699 --> 05:58:43.401
THE GOOD SENATOR FROM LA WHAT

05:58:43.468 --> 05:58:43.969
BROUGHT THE OUR ATTENTION TO

05:58:44.035 --> 05:58:47.205
THIS ISSUE. IN MY DISTRICT WE

05:58:47.272 --> 05:58:49.307
HAVE SOME OFFSHORE FACILITIES

05:58:49.374 --> 05:58:53.311
THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN. WHAT WE

05:58:53.378 --> 05:58:55.580
HAVE SEEN IS THE COMPANIES

05:58:55.647 --> 05:58:58.617
WHICH HAVE BEEN MAKING MILLIONS

05:58:58.683 --> 05:58:59.150
IF NOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

05:58:59.217 --> 05:59:01.786
DRILLING THE SOIL. ULTIMATELY

05:59:01.853 --> 05:59:05.156
DECLARING BANKRUPTCY. AND

05:59:05.223 --> 05:59:06.625
HANDING THE DEED BACK TO THE

05:59:06.691 --> 05:59:09.494
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE

05:59:09.561 --> 05:59:12.697
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE ONE

05:59:12.764 --> 05:59:14.366
YOU WANT ME AS TAXPAYERS WHO

05:59:14.432 --> 05:59:16.001
HAVE HAD TO PAY TO DECOMMISSION

05:59:16.067 --> 05:59:18.803
THESE WELLS. THAT'S WHO'S

05:59:18.870 --> 05:59:21.473
PAYING THE TAB. THE REASON FOR

05:59:21.539 --> 05:59:26.211
THIS BILL. IS TO TRY TO PUT

05:59:26.278 --> 05:59:28.079
SOME OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY

05:59:28.146 --> 05:59:30.715
BACK ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

05:59:30.782 --> 05:59:31.950
DRILLED THE WELLS WHO HAVE MADE

05:59:32.017 --> 05:59:33.485
THE MONEY BY REQUIRING THAT

05:59:33.551 --> 05:59:36.888
THEY BOND. BUSINESSES ARE

05:59:36.955 --> 05:59:39.357
REQUIRED TO BELONG. THIS TRUST

05:59:39.424 --> 05:59:41.326
ASSURES THAT AT THE END OF THE

05:59:41.393 --> 05:59:42.527
LIFE CYCLE AND NO ONE SAYING

05:59:42.594 --> 05:59:44.763
WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEAVE IT'S

05:59:44.829 --> 05:59:47.699
WHEN THEY ARE DONE. DRILLING

05:59:47.766 --> 05:59:49.668
THEY CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY

05:59:49.734 --> 05:59:52.237
LEAVING US THE TAXPAYER WITH

05:59:52.304 --> 05:59:55.240
THE BILL. AND WE ARE PAYING THE

05:59:55.307 --> 05:59:56.942
BILL IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW

05:59:57.008 --> 06:00:00.045
WITH PLATFORM HOLLY. WE HAD TO

06:00:00.111 --> 06:00:01.947
HIRE THE COMPANY TO COME BACK

06:00:02.013 --> 06:00:03.348
IN TO RUN IT WHAT WE DO

06:00:03.415 --> 06:00:05.183
COMMISSION. THE TAXPAYER OF

06:00:05.250 --> 06:00:08.119
CALIFORNIA'S PAID OVER TWO

06:00:08.186 --> 06:00:11.022
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR

06:00:11.089 --> 06:00:13.825
TO DECOMMISSION THIS WELL.

06:00:13.892 --> 06:00:16.027
THAT'S YOUR MONEY IN MY MONEY.

06:00:16.094 --> 06:00:17.996
BECAUSE THE OIL COMPANY WAS NOT

06:00:18.063 --> 06:00:20.365
PROPERLY BONDED SO THAT THE

06:00:20.432 --> 06:00:22.567
COST WOULD BE PAID BY THE BOND

06:00:22.634 --> 06:00:24.736
IN BY THE COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN

06:00:24.803 --> 06:00:26.805
MAKING THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

06:00:26.871 --> 06:00:29.040
DRILLING OIL WE HAVE HUNDREDS

06:00:29.107 --> 06:00:31.309
OF ABANDONED WELLS IN MY

06:00:31.376 --> 06:00:33.378
DISTRICT. THE COMPANIES ARE

06:00:33.445 --> 06:00:35.313
LONG NOT A BUSINESS THEY ARE

06:00:35.380 --> 06:00:37.515
ORPHANED WELLS THERE'S NOBODY

06:00:37.582 --> 06:00:39.818
LEFT TO PAY THE TAB. EXCEPT THE

06:00:39.884 --> 06:00:42.053
TAXPAYER. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

06:00:42.120 --> 06:00:46.891
IS ALL ABOUT. THE SMALL PERSON

06:00:46.958 --> 06:00:48.026
ISN'T GOING TO GET HIT THEY CAN

06:00:48.093 --> 06:00:50.395
COMBINED TOGETHER THE ESTIMATE

06:00:50.462 --> 06:00:52.263
WILL BE MADE AS TO WHAT THE

06:00:52.330 --> 06:00:56.267
COSTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE. SO

06:00:56.334 --> 06:01:00.872
THAT THE TAXPAYER DOESN'T GET.

06:01:00.939 --> 06:01:01.506
GET STUCK HOLDING IN PAYING THE

06:01:01.573 --> 06:01:03.908
TAB. THAT'S WHY THIS IS A GOOD

06:01:03.975 --> 06:01:09.080
BILL. IT IS A MODEST BILL. IT

06:01:09.147 --> 06:01:11.116
IS A BILL THAT SAYS YOU GOT TO

06:01:11.182 --> 06:01:15.553
LET US KNOW. AND YOU GOT A BOND.

06:01:15.620 --> 06:01:17.222
UP TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT SO THAT

06:01:17.288 --> 06:01:20.291
WHEN AND IF YOU WERE GOING TO

06:01:20.358 --> 06:01:22.761
LEAVE WITHOUT CLEANING UP. THE

06:01:22.827 --> 06:01:24.796
AREA AROUND THE WELL WITHOUT DE

06:01:24.863 --> 06:01:27.632
COMMISSIONING THE WELL. AT

06:01:27.699 --> 06:01:30.035
LEAST THE TAXPAYER ISN'T GOING

06:01:30.101 --> 06:01:31.569
TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR IT AND

06:01:31.636 --> 06:01:33.671
WITH THAT. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

06:01:33.738 --> 06:01:35.874
ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK

06:01:35.940 --> 06:01:37.909
YOU CENTER JACKSON SEEING NO

06:01:37.976 --> 06:01:41.246
FURTHER SENATOR BOARD YES.

06:01:41.312 --> 06:01:42.647
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I

06:01:42.714 --> 06:01:44.382
WASN'T PLANNING ON SPEAKING ON

06:01:44.449 --> 06:01:47.819
THIS ISSUE I KNOW A LOT OF US

06:01:47.886 --> 06:01:51.056
HAVE SOME TORN INTERESTS. MAYBE

06:01:51.122 --> 06:01:52.290
WE REPRESENT AREAS WERE

06:01:52.357 --> 06:01:54.592
DRILLING OCCURS WITH THE FOSSEL

06:01:54.659 --> 06:01:57.629
INDUSTRIES PRESENT. BUT I DON'T

06:01:57.695 --> 06:01:59.197
THINK WE SHOULD BE CAN WE

06:01:59.264 --> 06:02:01.566
SHOULD BE MISLED BY SOME OF THE

06:02:01.633 --> 06:02:04.202
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE HERE. I

06:02:04.269 --> 06:02:07.472
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. ALL

06:02:07.539 --> 06:02:09.040
THE INDUSTRY PLAYERS. ARE

06:02:09.107 --> 06:02:10.642
WILLING. TO PARTICIPATE IN A

06:02:10.708 --> 06:02:14.712
PROGRAM. AND MY COLLEAGUES WHO

06:02:14.779 --> 06:02:17.115
SPOKE JUST A MOMENT AGO HAS

06:02:17.182 --> 06:02:20.185
BASICALLY SAID THAT. THESE

06:02:20.251 --> 06:02:21.920
INDIVIDUALS HAVE CREATED

06:02:21.986 --> 06:02:25.990
PROBLEMS AND HAVE WALKED AWAY.

06:02:26.057 --> 06:02:26.558
I BELIEVE THAT PROBABLY HAS

06:02:26.624 --> 06:02:28.660
OCCURRED IN SOME INSTANCES BUT

06:02:28.726 --> 06:02:30.829
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THAT WE

06:02:30.895 --> 06:02:33.865
ARE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS.

06:02:33.932 --> 06:02:35.333
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT

06:02:35.400 --> 06:02:37.235
IN TO USE THE WORDS OF SOMEONE

06:02:37.302 --> 06:02:39.804
ELSE A PARTIAL SOLUTION IS NOT

06:02:39.871 --> 06:02:42.907
A SOLUTION AT ALL. IN THIS

06:02:42.974 --> 06:02:44.309
EXACTLY THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT

06:02:44.375 --> 06:02:46.177
WE'RE SEEING RIGHT HERE. THIS

06:02:46.244 --> 06:02:49.314
IS A PARTIAL SOLUTION THAT DOES

06:02:49.380 --> 06:02:50.682
NOT INCLUDE ALL THE RELEVANT

06:02:50.748 --> 06:02:52.884
PLAYERS. IN A MORE SERIOUS

06:02:52.951 --> 06:02:54.686
ABOUT GOOD POLICY AS WE'VE

06:02:54.752 --> 06:02:57.455
HEARD THAT WE ARE. THIS IS NOT

06:02:57.522 --> 06:03:01.593
RIGHT FOR PRIME TIME. THIS IS A

06:03:01.659 --> 06:03:03.928
HALF BAKED PIECE OF LEGISLATION

06:03:03.995 --> 06:03:05.930
THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE MOST

06:03:05.997 --> 06:03:07.065
RELEVANT PLAYERS IN THE

06:03:07.132 --> 06:03:09.968
INDUSTRY IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT

06:03:10.034 --> 06:03:11.703
MAKING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

06:03:11.769 --> 06:03:14.205
INTERESTS PARAMOUNT THEN YOU

06:03:14.272 --> 06:03:15.940
CAN'T JUST SIMPLY HAVE A

06:03:16.007 --> 06:03:18.309
PARTIAL SOLUTION. I WOULD

06:03:18.376 --> 06:03:21.613
RECOMMEND RESPECTFULLY. THERE'S

06:03:21.679 --> 06:03:23.982
A LOT OF MERIT IN THIS PIECE OF

06:03:24.048 --> 06:03:26.050
LEGISLATION THAT INDIVIDUALS IN

06:03:26.117 --> 06:03:28.086
THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY NEED

06:03:28.153 --> 06:03:30.088
TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE INTEREST

06:03:30.155 --> 06:03:32.023
P. RESPONSIBLE PLAYERS IN

06:03:32.090 --> 06:03:33.191
STEWARDS OF OUR ENVIRONMENT

06:03:33.258 --> 06:03:35.493
WHILE STILL KEEPING OUR YOUR

06:03:35.560 --> 06:03:37.262
OUR ECONOMY MOVING FORWARD

06:03:37.328 --> 06:03:39.864
LET'S BE REALISTIC HERE. BUT

06:03:39.931 --> 06:03:40.798
WE'RE PICKING WINNERS AND

06:03:40.865 --> 06:03:43.134
LOSERS WHEN WE HAVEN'T WE'VE

06:03:43.201 --> 06:03:45.069
NOT EVEN EXHAUSTED THE

06:03:45.136 --> 06:03:45.537
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A

06:03:45.603 --> 06:03:48.439
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. I WOULD

06:03:48.506 --> 06:03:50.775
RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES

06:03:50.842 --> 06:03:52.677
TO ABSTAIN ALLOW THIS TO GO

06:03:52.744 --> 06:03:54.712
BACK TO THE PROCESS BE

06:03:54.779 --> 06:03:57.448
REINTRODUCED IN JANUARY AS A

06:03:57.515 --> 06:04:00.485
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION ONE THAT

06:04:00.552 --> 06:04:02.420
ACTUALLY WILL BE SUSTAINABLE IT

06:04:02.487 --> 06:04:05.757
DOES NOT DRIVE OUT SMALL AND

06:04:05.823 --> 06:04:06.491
MEDIUM SIZE FIRMS. FROM THIS

06:04:06.558 --> 06:04:08.159
ENTIRE INDUSTRY. BECAUSE THAT

06:04:08.226 --> 06:04:10.395
IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE PEOPLE

06:04:10.461 --> 06:04:12.463
LOSE THEIR JOBS COMMUNITIES

06:04:12.530 --> 06:04:15.433

OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING THAT

MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED BUT IT

06:24:49.299 --> 06:24:52.002
DOES SPECIFICALLY ARM FILL A

06:24:52.068 --> 06:24:55.672
GAP THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW AND

06:24:55.739 --> 06:24:57.874
IN OUR COMMUNITIES THERE'S

06:24:57.941 --> 06:24:59.843
FARMWORKER FAMILIES THAT HAVE

06:24:59.910 --> 06:25:01.745

06:25:21.064 --> 06:25:21.531
IN THIS BILL THAT I HAVE

06:25:21.598 --> 06:25:22.566
CONCERNS ABOUT AND I'D LIKE TO

06:25:22.632 --> 06:25:25.669
ASK THE FLOOR MANAGER TO

06:25:25.735 --> 06:25:28.538

PLEASE PROCEED. THE FIRST

06:25:34.177 --> 06:25:37.314
QUESTION I HAD IS THE- THE

06:25:37.380 --> 06:25:37.948
CONCERN THAT THIS HOUSING WOULD

06:25:38.014 --> 06:25:40.517
NOT BE AVAILABLE. TO THOSE WITH

06:25:40.584 --> 06:25:42.586
H. TWO A. VISA IS NOT THE WORDS

06:25:42.652 --> 06:25:43.954
THERE'D BE DISCRIMINATION AND

06:25:44.020 --> 06:25:45.489
THE AVAILABILITY THIS HOUSING

06:25:45.555 --> 06:25:48.291
BASED ON. A FARMWORKERS

06:25:48.358 --> 06:25:48.825
DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED

06:25:48.892 --> 06:25:51.394
STATUS COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT.

06:25:51.461 --> 06:25:54.231
SURE WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT

06:25:54.297 --> 06:25:56.700
PRECLUDES THE USE OF STATE

06:25:56.766 --> 06:25:59.102
FUNDS THE PAPER HOUSING FOR

06:25:59.169 --> 06:26:00.136
EACH TO A WORKERS OUT

06:26:00.203 --> 06:26:02.138
SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT DOES. YOU

06:26:02.205 --> 06:26:03.740
CAN USE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER

06:26:03.807 --> 06:26:06.142
DOLLARS TO PAY FOR HOUSING FOR

06:26:06.209 --> 06:26:08.278
A TO A WORKERS AND THE REASON

06:26:08.345 --> 06:26:10.647
IS ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE THE H.

06:26:10.714 --> 06:26:13.917
TO A AUGUST WORKER PROGRAM IS A

06:26:13.984 --> 06:26:16.520
PROGRAM WHERE AN EMPLOYER.

06:26:16.586 --> 06:26:17.687
BRINGS IN WORKERS FROM OUTSIDE

06:26:17.754 --> 06:26:20.857
OF THE COUNTRY. AND IS GIVEN

06:26:20.924 --> 06:26:22.692
ALLOW THE TO HAVE VISAS FOR

06:26:22.759 --> 06:26:24.828
THOSE WORKERS AS GUEST WORKERS

06:26:24.895 --> 06:26:26.897
AND IN EXCHANGE UNDER FEDERAL

06:26:26.963 --> 06:26:29.099
LAW THAT EMPLOYER IS REQUIRED

06:26:29.165 --> 06:26:31.301
TO PROVIDE CERTAIN BASIC LIVING

06:26:31.368 --> 06:26:33.436
NECESSITIES FOR THOSE WORKERS.

06:26:33.503 --> 06:26:35.772
INCLUDING HOUSING AND SO IN

06:26:35.839 --> 06:26:38.074
ORDER TO THE EMPLOYER BENEFITS

06:26:38.141 --> 06:26:39.509
BY BRINGING IN TEMPORARY GUEST

06:26:39.576 --> 06:26:41.611
WORKERS AND IS REQUIRED TO

06:26:41.678 --> 06:26:42.345
AMONG OTHER THINGS PROVIDE

06:26:42.412 --> 06:26:44.281
HOUSING. ON I DON'T THINK

06:26:44.347 --> 06:26:46.716
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE

06:26:46.783 --> 06:26:48.919
PAYING FOR THAT OBLIGATION THAT

06:26:48.985 --> 06:26:50.854
THOSE EMPLOYERS HAVING HEARD

06:26:50.921 --> 06:26:52.489
UNDER FEDERAL LAW IN EXCHANGE

06:26:52.556 --> 06:26:54.257
FOR BRINGING IN. THOSE GUEST

06:26:54.324 --> 06:26:56.126
WORKERS I THINK WE SHOULD NOT

06:26:56.192 --> 06:26:58.028
BE FOCUSING OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE

06:26:58.094 --> 06:26:59.262
THERE'S EMPLOYERS HAVE THAT

06:26:59.329 --> 06:27:00.864
OBLIGATION AND THEY SHOULD BE

06:27:00.931 --> 06:27:03.466
PAYING FOR THAT OBLIGATION. AND

06:27:03.533 --> 06:27:07.671
SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY. QUITE

06:27:07.737 --> 06:27:08.305
STRAIGHTFORWARD WHY WE HAVE THE

06:27:08.371 --> 06:27:11.207
RESTRICTION IN THE BILL. THANK

06:27:11.274 --> 06:27:11.775
YOU THANK YOU AND MY SECOND

06:27:11.841 --> 06:27:14.144
QUESTION. THIS IS LAND THAT

06:27:14.210 --> 06:27:14.878
FARMERS ON THEMSELVES BUT UNDER

06:27:14.945 --> 06:27:17.681
THIS LEGISLATION IT IT SEEMS TO

06:27:17.747 --> 06:27:18.481
REQUIRE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO

06:27:18.548 --> 06:27:20.584
BUILD THIS HOUSING. THAT

06:27:20.650 --> 06:27:22.586
ACTUALLY THE FARMERS THEMSELVES

06:27:22.652 --> 06:27:24.788
CAN'T BUILD IT THEY HAVE TO.

06:27:24.854 --> 06:27:27.424
RETAIN A- ANOTHER ENTITY

06:27:27.490 --> 06:27:34.831
ACTUALLY. TO CONSTRUCT THE

06:27:34.898 --> 06:27:35.765
HOUSING ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY

06:27:35.832 --> 06:27:37.667
IS THAT IS THAT I READ THE BILL

06:27:37.734 --> 06:27:38.568
CORRECTLY IT'S MORE ABOUT

06:27:38.635 --> 06:27:41.571
MANAGING. THE PROPERTY I THINK

06:27:41.638 --> 06:27:43.106
THE THINKING IS THAT YOU DON'T

06:27:43.173 --> 06:27:46.242
WANT SO YOU DON'T WANT THE BOSS

06:27:46.309 --> 06:27:47.444
TO ALSO BE THE LANDLORD. YOU

06:27:47.510 --> 06:27:48.478
ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE THAT

06:27:48.545 --> 06:27:52.182
SEPARATION IF YOUR BOSS IS ALSO

06:27:52.248 --> 06:27:54.017
YOUR LANDLORD. THAT CAN CREATE

06:27:54.084 --> 06:27:55.785
HUGE PROBLEMS YOU LOSE YOUR JOB

06:27:55.852 --> 06:27:56.886
THAT MEANS YOU CAN

06:27:56.953 --> 06:27:58.321
AUTOMATICALLY LOSE YOUR

06:27:58.388 --> 06:28:00.957
HOUSING. AND SO WITH THE FIGURE

06:28:01.024 --> 06:28:02.592
IN THIS BILL AND WE HAVE TO

06:28:02.659 --> 06:28:03.893
WORK LAST YEAR WHEN I CARRIED A

06:28:03.960 --> 06:28:06.529
SIMILAR BILL WE WORKED ON THIS

06:28:06.596 --> 06:28:09.132
ISSUE EXTENSIVELY. TO WHINE AND

06:28:09.199 --> 06:28:11.267
OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY TO BE THE

06:28:11.334 --> 06:28:13.403
ONE WHO ACTUALLY MANAGES THE

06:28:13.470 --> 06:28:18.008
PROPERTY SO THAT YOU DON'T.

06:28:18.074 --> 06:28:18.608
HAVE THE BOSS AND THE LANDLORD

06:28:18.675 --> 06:28:23.113
BEING THE SAME PERSON. GREAT

06:28:23.179 --> 06:28:24.314
AND THEN I AM MY OWN TIME SO

06:28:24.381 --> 06:28:25.115
THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION

06:28:25.181 --> 06:28:26.249
AND I THINK. THOSE QUESTIONS

06:28:26.316 --> 06:28:28.952
HIGHLIGHTS SOME CONCERNS THAT

06:28:29.019 --> 06:28:30.320
THAT MANY HAVE ABOUT THIS BILL.

TYPE OF HOUSING AVAILABLE. AND

06:28:43.800 --> 06:28:45.802
IF THE FARMERS GOING TO PROVIDE

06:28:45.869 --> 06:28:46.403
THAT HOUSING ON THEIR PROPERTY

06:28:46.469 --> 06:28:48.705
SHOULD THEY HAVE SOME RIGHTS. I

06:28:48.772 --> 06:28:51.274
IN TERMS OF BEING THE LANDLORD

06:28:51.341 --> 06:28:53.510
MAKING SURE IT'S- IT'S BEING

06:28:53.576 --> 06:28:56.780
RUN CORRECTLY. AND SO WITH THAT

06:28:56.846 --> 06:29:01.351
MEMBERS AT CONCERNS RAISED INTO

YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I

06:29:11.494 --> 06:29:13.897
WOULD TO RISE IN OPPOSITION

06:29:13.963 --> 06:29:15.732
SOME OF THE SAME REASONS WHY IT

06:29:15.799 --> 06:29:16.466
CALLING FROM ALAMEDA BROUGHT UP

06:29:16.533 --> 06:29:18.468
DURING QUESTIONING SO WE HAVE

06:29:18.535 --> 06:29:19.069
YOU MAY NOT KNOW BUT IN MY

06:29:19.135 --> 06:29:21.304
DISTRICT WE RAISE ABOUT 95% OF

06:29:21.371 --> 06:29:22.939
THE WORLD'S STRAWBERRY PLANTS

06:29:23.006 --> 06:29:24.874
NOT THE BERRIES BUT THE PLANTS.

06:29:24.941 --> 06:29:28.712
AND WE RELY ON. THOSE AGE TO A

06:29:28.778 --> 06:29:29.713
FARM WORKER HOUSING PROGRAMS

06:29:29.779 --> 06:29:32.582
THAT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE IN ARE

06:29:32.649 --> 06:29:34.751
VERY RULE COMMUNITIES AND THIS

06:29:34.818 --> 06:29:35.719
BILL WILL ACTUALLY WORK AND ADD

06:29:35.785 --> 06:29:36.853
IT BE AN ADVERSARY TO WHAT THE

06:29:36.920 --> 06:29:38.321
PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE

06:29:38.388 --> 06:29:40.156
NOW TO TRY TO AND WE'RE

06:29:40.223 --> 06:29:41.057
STRAPPED FOR HOUSING FOR THESE

06:29:41.124 --> 06:29:42.659
WORKERS. SO I THINK THERE'S

06:29:42.726 --> 06:29:44.027
SOME PROBLEMS WITH HIS BILL

06:29:44.094 --> 06:29:46.629
BECAUSE IS A THIRD PARTY AND

06:29:46.696 --> 06:29:47.230
NOT ALLOWING THE ACTUAL. SOME

06:29:47.297 --> 06:29:50.467
OF THESE ARE. BIG CORPORATIONS

06:29:50.533 --> 06:29:53.103
LIKE DRISKELL STRAWBERRIES TO

06:29:53.169 --> 06:29:56.139
HAVE AS STOP IN. THE MONTEREY

06:29:56.206 --> 06:29:57.173
AND THEY BUT THE OTHER PLANS OF

06:29:57.240 --> 06:29:58.875
THEIR AND SO WE WE'RE WE'VE

06:29:58.942 --> 06:29:59.843
BEEN WORKING ON THE H. TO A

06:29:59.909 --> 06:30:01.811

WORKING WITH THE COMMIES AND H.

06:30:07.984 --> 06:30:10.386
TO A PROGRAM. AND THIS. ABILITY

06:30:10.453 --> 06:30:11.888
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TO FIGURE

06:30:11.955 --> 06:30:14.124
OUT. WHICH EMPLOYEES ARE WHICH

06:30:14.190 --> 06:30:16.226
CATEGORIES I THINK WILL BE VERY

06:30:16.292 --> 06:30:17.160
DIFFICULT SO I THINK THIS BILL

06:30:17.227 --> 06:30:18.461
NEEDS A LITTLE MORE WORK AND

06:30:18.528 --> 06:30:22.432

THAT PART OF ME COULD

06:45:53.595 --> 06:45:55.531
UNDERSTAND THAT AS A MATTER OF

PUBLIC POLICY YOU DON'T WANT TO

PROCESS EITHER DIRECTLY OR AS A

06:46:01.937 --> 06:46:04.873
WITNESS IN DIRECTLY BUT I THINK

06:46:04.940 --> 06:46:06.542
THIS BILL GOES FURTHER THAN

06:46:06.608 --> 06:46:08.577
THAT IT'S NOT JUST LIMITED TO

06:46:08.644 --> 06:46:11.213
IMMIGRATION ISSUES. IT'S

06:46:11.280 --> 06:46:14.149
EVERYTHING IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

06:46:14.216 --> 06:46:16.819
AND IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS THE

06:46:16.885 --> 06:46:20.022
SUBJECT OF A WARRANT AND HERE

06:46:20.089 --> 06:46:20.789
SHE HAPPENS TO BE AT THE

06:46:20.856 --> 06:46:22.458
COURTHOUSE. WHY WOULD WE

06:46:22.524 --> 06:46:24.960
DISSUADE THE SHERIFF FROM

06:46:25.027 --> 06:46:29.631

THE POLICE DEPARTMENT DOING THE

06:46:30.332 --> 06:46:34.136

06:46:35.871 --> 06:46:36.839
THERE ARE NO SANCTUARY

06:46:44.513 --> 06:46:46.548

06:46:51.620 --> 06:46:53.689
REALLY WHAT THIS IS ASKING. IF

06:46:53.756 --> 06:46:55.524
THAT WERE THE CASE THEN I THINK

06:46:55.591 --> 06:46:56.525
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT A WHOLE

06:46:56.592 --> 06:46:58.427

ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE FULL TIME.

07:50:05.010 --> 07:50:06.244
PHYSICAL THERAPIST SO MANY OF

HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS FOR THEM

07:50:17.522 --> 07:50:18.456
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO

07:50:18.523 --> 07:50:19.324

ASSUME LEGAL RISKS THIS IS

07:51:44.709 --> 07:51:45.810
ESPECIALLY CONCERNING WHEN OUR

07:51:45.877 --> 07:51:47.445

YET OVER FOUR HUNDRED TRUCKING

07:51:55.987 --> 07:51:57.956
COMPANIES AT THE PORT HAD BEEN

07:51:58.023 --> 07:52:01.359
CITED WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

07:52:01.426 --> 07:52:04.963
IN JUDGMENTS FAVORING TRUCKERS.

07:52:05.030 --> 07:52:05.730

BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LA

07:52:07.666 --> 07:52:09.634
CONTINUED. ON BEHALF OF THE

07:52:09.701 --> 07:52:11.336
TRUCKERS AND IT MANY OF THESE

07:52:11.403 --> 07:52:14.172
TRUCKERS WERE EXPECTED TO WORK

07:52:14.239 --> 07:52:15.974
OVER TWENTY HOURS A DAY.

07:52:16.041 --> 07:52:17.409
REASSIGNED TO THE LOWEST PAYING

07:52:17.475 --> 07:52:19.577
GROUPS MANY OF THESE ROUTES

07:52:19.644 --> 07:52:21.012
WHICH OFTEN TRANSLATED INTO

07:52:21.079 --> 07:52:22.981
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. OR LESS

07:52:23.048 --> 07:52:24.749

WORK WHICH RESULTS AT THREE

07:52:26.751 --> 07:52:29.854
DOLLARS AN HOUR. BUT LET'S BE

07:52:29.921 --> 07:52:31.723
CLEAR DYNAMICS IN AB FIVE DOES

07:52:31.790 --> 07:52:34.592
NOT FORCE OWNER OPERATORS TO

07:52:34.659 --> 07:52:35.560
BECOME EMPLOYEES IF THEY ARE

07:52:35.627 --> 07:52:37.862
NOT BEING MISCLASSIFIED. SIMPLY

07:52:37.929 --> 07:52:39.931
EMPOWERS INDEPENDENT OWNERS

07:52:39.998 --> 07:52:41.299
OWNER OPERATORS BY REMOVING THE

07:52:41.366 --> 07:52:43.468
MIDDLE MAN OR BROKER AND ALLOWS

07:52:43.535 --> 07:52:45.637
DRIVERS TO SET THEIR OWN RATES

07:52:45.704 --> 07:52:47.372
WHICH IS THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE.

07:52:47.439 --> 07:52:49.074
CONSTRUCTION TRUCKING ALSO HAS

07:52:49.140 --> 07:52:50.909
A VERY LIMITED EXEMPTION THAT

07:52:50.975 --> 07:52:52.010
RECOGNIZES THE PATTERN OF

07:52:52.077 --> 07:52:53.611
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS WE

07:52:53.678 --> 07:52:55.113
HAVE SOME EMPLOYEE DRIVERS AND

07:52:55.180 --> 07:52:57.148
OCCASIONALLY HIGHER INDEPENDENT

07:52:57.215 --> 07:52:59.250
OWNER OPERATORS. THE AUTHOR IN

07:52:59.317 --> 07:53:01.686
THE SPONSORS OF AB FIVE ARE

07:53:01.753 --> 07:53:02.320
ALSO COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE

07:53:02.387 --> 07:53:04.255
SMALL TRUCKING COMPANIES.

07:53:04.322 --> 07:53:05.523
BUSINESSES SUCH AS A TRULY TO

07:53:05.590 --> 07:53:07.325
TRULY ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE BY

07:53:07.392 --> 07:53:08.760
PROVIDING THEM WITH ASSISTANCE

07:53:08.827 --> 07:53:10.428
TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES.

07:53:10.495 --> 07:53:11.463
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL

07:53:11.529 --> 07:53:13.331
CONTINUE TO SEE THIS INVOLVED

07:53:13.398 --> 07:53:15.533
AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE. IF THEY

07:53:15.600 --> 07:53:17.135
ARE MISCLASSIFIED ARMS ARE IF%

07:53:17.202 --> 07:53:18.536
THEY ARE TRULY INDEPENDENT

07:53:18.603 --> 07:53:20.071
CONTRACTORS THAT THEY HAVE A

07:53:20.138 --> 07:53:21.940
DIRECTION TO BE SO AND AS THE

07:53:22.006 --> 07:53:23.074
DAUGHTER OF A TRUCK DRIVER WHO

07:53:25.210 --> 07:53:26.277
MAKING ABOUT ONE IN THE

07:53:26.344 --> 07:53:28.780
MORNING. TO BE ABLE TO. PUT

07:53:28.847 --> 07:53:30.148

07:53:33.284 --> 07:53:33.818

TAKING CARE OF HIS GRANDCHILD.

07:53:42.260 --> 07:53:44.496
AND THAT'S BECAUSE- HE HAD THE

07:53:44.562 --> 07:53:47.499
OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN A UNION AND

07:53:47.565 --> 07:53:48.066

UNFETTERED DREAMS OTHER THAN

08:03:37.254 --> 08:03:39.657
TO RAISE A FAMILY IT WAS A

08:03:39.724 --> 08:03:40.291
STARTING LEVEL WAGE. AND THEN I

HOLE. A RELATIVE RECENT RABBIT

OF CONFIRMATION BIAS.

08:08:37.254 --> 08:08:38.822
CONFIRMATION BIAS CONFIRMATION

BELIEF. CONFIRMATION BIAS AM I

08:08:51.835 --> 08:08:53.203
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT I QUITE

08:08:53.270 --> 08:08:54.104
FRANKLY THOUGHT ABOUT ALL MY

08:09:00.144 --> 08:09:01.578
FRANKLY VERY PREDICTABLE.

08:09:01.645 --> 08:09:03.180
BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL SUFFER

08:09:03.247 --> 08:09:05.616
FROM CONFIRMATION BIAS. WHEN

08:09:05.683 --> 08:09:07.017

WHO EVALUATED THE POTENTIAL TO

GET AN EXEMPTION. I DON'T KNOW

08:22:57.814 --> 08:23:00.216
ALL THOSE DETAILS BUT MY

08:23:00.283 --> 08:23:02.418
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THERE'S

08:23:08.358 --> 08:23:09.425
YOU'RE NOT UNDER OATH AND

08:23:09.492 --> 08:23:10.760
YOU'RE NOT IN A COURT OF LAW

08:23:10.827 --> 08:23:12.362

08:23:21.437 --> 08:23:23.840
UNFORTUNATELY IT SAYS ON THE

08:23:23.907 --> 08:23:25.241
BOTTOM LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE

08:23:25.308 --> 08:23:29.946
FORM. THE AFL CIO SO. I CAN

08:23:30.013 --> 08:23:32.815
ONLY OPINED THAT. THESE

08:23:32.882 --> 08:23:34.117
APPLICATIONS WERE REVIEWED BY A

08:23:34.183 --> 08:23:38.721
LABOR UNION. NOT NECESSARILY

08:23:38.788 --> 08:23:40.523
EARLY BY THE AUTHOR TO DELIVER

08:23:40.590 --> 08:23:43.092
THESE EXEMPTIONS. I MEAN DO YOU

08:23:43.159 --> 08:23:47.096
THINK. IF THE LABOR UNIONS ARE

08:23:47.163 --> 08:23:48.097
REALLY GONNA PICK WHO'S GETTING

08:23:48.164 --> 08:23:49.399
EXEMPTIONS WAS NOT GETTING

08:23:49.465 --> 08:23:50.600
EXEMPTIONS A LEASE WOULD TAKE

08:23:50.667 --> 08:23:51.868
HER NAME OFF THE APPLICATION

08:23:51.935 --> 08:23:54.704
FORM. BUT IN THE BEST INTERESTS

08:23:54.771 --> 08:23:55.271
OF TRANSPARENCY I GUESS IT'S

08:23:55.338 --> 08:23:57.907
GOOD THAT WE KNOW. I HAVEN'T

08:23:57.974 --> 08:23:59.442
BEEN. IN THE STATE CAPITALS

08:23:59.509 --> 08:24:01.644
LONG AS MANY OF YOU BUT I HAVE

08:24:01.711 --> 08:24:02.211
TO TELL YOU. I FIND IT VERY

08:24:02.278 --> 08:24:05.882
OFFENSIVE. THAT THE AUTHORS

08:24:05.949 --> 08:24:07.784
OFFICES TURN THIS BILL INTO A

08:24:07.850 --> 08:24:08.985
CHRISTMAS TREE FOR LABOR

08:24:09.052 --> 08:24:11.854
UNIONS. THAT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE

08:24:11.921 --> 08:24:12.422
AN OFFICE RIGHT HERE IN THE

08:24:12.488 --> 08:24:15.858
STATE CAPITAL. I MIGHT BE NAIVE

08:24:15.925 --> 08:24:16.793
BUT I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY

08:24:16.859 --> 08:24:18.661
INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE DOCUMENTS

08:24:18.728 --> 08:24:19.929
HANDED OUT TO PEOPLE REQUESTING

08:24:19.996 --> 08:24:23.032
AN EXEMPTION. FOR AB FIVE THAT

08:24:23.099 --> 08:24:24.400
ARE PLAINLY PREPARED BY

08:24:24.467 --> 08:24:27.337
ORGANIZED LABOR THE AFL CIO TO

08:24:27.403 --> 08:24:35.244
BE SPECIFIC. BUT EVEN THOUGH

08:24:35.311 --> 08:24:35.812
THE PROCESS THE GODDESS HERE

08:24:35.878 --> 08:24:39.282
STINKS. I THINK THE BILL ITSELF

08:24:39.349 --> 08:24:43.286
IS FATALLY FLAWED. AB FIVE WILL

08:24:43.353 --> 08:24:45.421
MEAN THE END OF THE INDEPENDENT

08:24:45.488 --> 08:24:47.123
CONTRACTOR STATUS FOR HUNDREDS

08:24:47.190 --> 08:24:49.926
OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS.

08:24:49.993 --> 08:24:51.494
SUPPORTERS WILL ARGUE THAT THIS

08:24:51.561 --> 08:24:54.297
BILL PROTECTS WORKERS. BUT WHAT

08:24:54.364 --> 08:24:55.832
ABOUT THE FRANCHISE OWNERS WHO

08:24:55.898 --> 08:24:57.300
LOSE THEIR FRANCHISES AND THEN

08:24:57.367 --> 08:24:59.802
HAVE TO FIRE THE WORKERS WHO

08:24:59.869 --> 08:25:00.370
DEPEND ON THEIR JOBS TO FEED

08:25:00.436 --> 08:25:02.905
THEIR FAMILIES. BUT WHAT THE

08:25:02.972 --> 08:25:04.340
MAN OR THE WOMAN WHO WORKS A

08:25:04.407 --> 08:25:05.575
FEW HOURS ON THE WEEKEND FOR

08:25:05.642 --> 08:25:08.177
UBER LEFT OR DOOR DASH TO MAKE

08:25:08.244 --> 08:25:08.811
A FEW BUCKS ON THE SIDE TO MAKE

08:25:08.878 --> 08:25:12.515
ENDS MEET. I HAVE TENANTS THAT

08:25:12.582 --> 08:25:16.486
WORK FOR UBER LEFT. A COUPLE OF

08:25:16.552 --> 08:25:18.354
THE MAKE OVER A HUNDRED AND

08:25:18.421 --> 08:25:21.591
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

08:25:21.658 --> 08:25:23.493
THAT'S THEY DO A GREAT JOB OF

08:25:23.559 --> 08:25:25.628
SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES. THAT

08:25:25.695 --> 08:25:27.797
WORK WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK AND

08:25:27.864 --> 08:25:28.765
DON'T WORK WHEN THEY DON'T WANT

08:25:28.831 --> 08:25:31.367
TO WORK. IT'S BEEN A GREAT

08:25:31.434 --> 08:25:33.770
GREAT MODEL FOR SINGLE MOMS.

08:25:33.836 --> 08:25:37.206
FOR SINGLE DADS. FOR PEOPLE THE

08:25:37.273 --> 08:25:38.341
NEED TO MAKE A FEW EXTRA BUCKS

08:25:38.408 --> 08:25:40.109
SO THEY CAN FEED THEIR KIDS PUT

08:25:40.176 --> 08:25:42.078
THE KIDS IN POP WARNER FOOTBALL

08:25:42.145 --> 08:25:47.216
LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL. OR WHAT

08:25:47.283 --> 08:25:47.817
ABOUT THE TRUCKER WE'VE HEARD

08:25:47.884 --> 08:25:51.154
SO MUCH ABOUT TODAY. WHO SPEND

08:25:51.220 --> 08:25:53.356
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

08:25:53.423 --> 08:25:56.526
DOLLARS TO BUY THEIR OWN TRUCK.

08:25:56.592 --> 08:25:58.928
SO THEY COULD DECIDE WHAT LOADS

08:25:58.995 --> 08:26:01.531
TO HAUL IT WOULD JOBS TO TAKE.

08:26:01.597 --> 08:26:05.134
IF THIS BILL GOES THROUGH. AND

08:26:05.201 --> 08:26:06.536
THEY HAVE TO BECOME EMPLOYEES

08:26:06.602 --> 08:26:08.871
OF LARGE TRUCKING COMPANIES.

08:26:08.938 --> 08:26:09.505
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING

08:26:09.572 --> 08:26:12.208
TO GET FOR THEIR TRUCKS. IF

08:26:12.275 --> 08:26:12.809
YOU'RE GONNA GET TOP VALUE FOR

08:26:12.875 --> 08:26:17.547
IT. WE'LL BE LUCKY IF THEY CAN

08:26:17.613 --> 08:26:22.518
SELL THE TRUCKS FOR WITH A. BY

08:26:22.585 --> 08:26:23.986
REQUIRING THESE PEOPLE TO

08:26:24.053 --> 08:26:25.388
BECOME EMPLOYEES THEY WILL

08:26:25.455 --> 08:26:29.158
BECOME. LIKELY. FORMER

08:26:29.225 --> 08:26:30.359
EMPLOYEES THE AUTHOR AND

08:26:30.426 --> 08:26:32.395
SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL SAY

08:26:32.462 --> 08:26:32.929
THEY'RE TRYING TO PROTECT

08:26:32.995 --> 08:26:36.265
PEOPLE FROM BEING EXPLOITED.

08:26:36.332 --> 08:26:36.866
SUPPORTERS ARE CLAIMING TO BE

08:26:36.933 --> 08:26:40.336
FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE THAT. MAKE

08:26:40.403 --> 08:26:42.805
THE LEAST THE MINIMUM WAGE WELL

08:26:42.872 --> 08:26:45.808
MY FRIENDS LET ME BE CLEAR. IN

08:26:45.875 --> 08:26:47.777
THIS CASE THE MINIMUM WAGE IS

08:26:47.844 --> 08:26:48.344
NOT TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IT'S

08:26:48.411 --> 08:26:49.445
NOT FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR.

08:26:49.512 --> 08:26:54.817
IT'S ZERO. THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE

08:26:54.884 --> 08:26:55.818
A PERSON WITHOUT A JOB MAKES

08:26:55.885 --> 08:26:58.621
ZERO. AND WILL BE MANY JOBS

08:26:58.688 --> 08:27:01.224

08:27:01.290 --> 08:27:03.760
YOUR BROAD BRUSH FIVE VOTE. ON

THE PEOPLE WILL BE HARMED BY

08:27:08.164 --> 08:27:10.600
THIS BILL GOING INTO EFFECT.

08:27:10.666 --> 08:27:12.735
THE TRUCKERS WHO WANT TO DECIDE

08:27:12.802 --> 08:27:14.570
WHAT THE HALL WHEN THE HOLIDAY

08:27:14.637 --> 08:27:16.038
WILL BE SHUT DOWN UNLESS THEY

08:27:16.105 --> 08:27:16.539
WANT TO BECOME EMPLOYEES

08:27:16.606 --> 08:27:18.107
SOMETHING. MANY DON'T WANT TO

08:27:18.174 --> 08:27:20.243
DO THE SINGLE FATHER WHO WANTS

08:27:20.309 --> 08:27:21.144
TO MAKE A FEW EXTRA BUCKS

08:27:21.210 --> 08:27:22.278
WORKING NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS

08:27:22.345 --> 08:27:23.946
WILL BE ABLE TO WORK FOR A

08:27:24.013 --> 08:27:25.314
COMPANY LIKE UBER LIFT BECAUSE

08:27:25.381 --> 08:27:27.517
LEAVE BIG LABOR WANTS TO HAVE

08:27:27.583 --> 08:27:29.819
BAD BE A MEMBER. OF THE UNION.

08:27:29.886 --> 08:27:30.920
PHYSICAL THERAPIST TO HELP

08:27:30.987 --> 08:27:32.588
PATIENTS AT REASONABLE RATES

08:27:32.655 --> 08:27:34.490
WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND WORK

08:27:34.557 --> 08:27:35.658
UNLESS THEY BECOME FULL TIME

08:27:35.725 --> 08:27:38.327
EMPLOYEES. OF A HOSPITAL OR A

08:27:38.394 --> 08:27:41.130
REHAB CENTER. THEREBY LOSING

08:27:41.197 --> 08:27:41.697
THE FLEXIBILITY THE BROUGHT

08:27:41.764 --> 08:27:42.865
MANY OF THEM INTO THE

08:27:42.932 --> 08:27:44.934
PROFESSION. NOW I DON'T BLAME

08:27:45.001 --> 08:27:48.638
THE PEOPLE. WHO FELT FORCED TO

08:27:48.704 --> 08:27:51.274
CUT THEIR OWN SPECIAL DEALS.

08:27:51.340 --> 08:27:53.709
WITH BIG LABOR AND THIS AUTHOR.

08:27:53.776 --> 08:27:55.812
I DON'T BLAME THAT THE

08:27:55.878 --> 08:27:56.412
ARCHITECTS GOT THEIR CAR ABOUT

08:27:56.479 --> 08:27:58.881
FROM THIS POORLY DESIGNED BILL.

08:27:58.948 --> 08:28:00.016
I DON'T BLAME INVESTMENT

08:28:00.082 --> 08:28:01.184
ADVISORS WHO MADE SURE THEY

08:28:01.250 --> 08:28:03.286
WERE GOING TO BE SUED BY GREEDY

08:28:03.352 --> 08:28:03.920
TRIAL LAWYERS LOOKING TO MAKE A

08:28:03.986 --> 08:28:07.089
QUICK BUCK. I DON'T FAULT THE

08:28:07.156 --> 08:28:08.991
REALTORS. WHO MADE SURE THEY

08:28:09.058 --> 08:28:10.693
DIDN'T GET CAUGHT IN THE LABOR

08:28:10.760 --> 08:28:13.596
UNIONS SPIDER WEB SPUN BY THE

08:28:13.663 --> 08:28:16.399
BLACK WIDOW OF PUBLIC POLICY.

08:28:16.465 --> 08:28:18.601
NOR DO I THINK IT'S A BAD THING

08:28:18.668 --> 08:28:19.936
THAT THE TWENTY EIGHT OTHER

08:28:20.002 --> 08:28:21.237
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS TO PAY

08:28:21.304 --> 08:28:23.573
THEIR TOLL TO THE LABOR UNION

08:28:23.639 --> 08:28:25.942
BOSSES GOT THE EXEMPTIONS.

08:28:26.008 --> 08:28:28.010
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT

08:28:28.077 --> 08:28:28.578
COSTS THEM BUT I'M SURE. IT

08:28:28.644 --> 08:28:31.380
WASN'T FREE. THERE'S A LOT OF

08:28:31.447 --> 08:28:32.982
REASONS TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL

08:28:33.049 --> 08:28:34.517
BUT PERHAPS THE BIGGEST REASON

08:28:34.584 --> 08:28:35.685
IS IT OPENS THE DOOR TO

08:28:35.751 --> 08:28:38.988
THOUSANDS. THOUSANDS OF

08:28:39.055 --> 08:28:39.956
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS TARGETING

08:28:40.022 --> 08:28:42.358
BUSINESS OWNERS. AND THOSE THAT

08:28:42.425 --> 08:28:45.795
HAVE BEEN PLAYING BY THE RULES.

08:28:45.862 --> 08:28:46.395
HERE'S WHAT I HAVE TO PRESUME

08:28:46.462 --> 08:28:48.764
IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE BILL.

08:28:48.831 --> 08:28:51.000
UNDER AB FIVE A DRIVER UBER

08:28:51.067 --> 08:28:52.501
WILL BE ABLE TO FILE A LAWSUIT

08:28:52.568 --> 08:28:54.904
AGAINST UBER TO COLLECT FOUR

08:28:54.971 --> 08:28:55.705
YEARS OF BACK PAY UNDER THE

08:28:55.771 --> 08:28:58.007
PROVISIONS OF THE LAW. MANY OF

08:28:58.074 --> 08:28:59.942
YOU VOTE FOR TODAY MANY THOSE

08:29:00.009 --> 08:29:03.079
DRIVERS WHO MADE OVER A HUNDRED

08:29:03.145 --> 08:29:03.746
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

08:29:03.813 --> 08:29:05.815
WORKING FOR THESE COMPANIES.

08:29:05.882 --> 08:29:07.350
THIS RETROACTIVE CLAW BACK FOR

08:29:07.416 --> 08:29:08.651
WAGES IT ALSO COMES WITH

08:29:08.718 --> 08:29:11.821
MASSIVE PENALTIES WILL FORCE.

08:29:11.888 --> 08:29:12.321
MANY COMPANIES TO CLOSE

08:29:12.388 --> 08:29:16.025
ENTIRELY. THIS BILL OPENS THE

08:29:16.092 --> 08:29:18.561
DOOR FOR AGGRESSIVE TRIAL

08:29:18.628 --> 08:29:19.128
LAWYERS TO TARGET BUSINESSES

08:29:19.195 --> 08:29:22.398
MUCH LIKE. CURRENTLY GOES ON

08:29:22.465 --> 08:29:24.100
WITH LAWYERS TARGETING

08:29:24.166 --> 08:29:25.635
BUSINESSES WITH FRIVOLOUS ADA

08:29:25.701 --> 08:29:29.071
LAWSUITS WERE OPEN THE DOOR TO

08:29:29.138 --> 08:29:32.942
A DUPLICATION. OF THIS. DURABLE

08:29:33.009 --> 08:29:35.811
FRIVOLOUS FILING OF LAWSUITS TO

08:29:35.878 --> 08:29:37.847
GET SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE THAT

08:29:37.914 --> 08:29:38.481
CAN ILL AFFORD TO PAY THE LEGAL

08:29:38.547 --> 08:29:41.751
FEES. SO WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S

08:29:41.817 --> 08:29:42.652
GOING TO HAPPEN THE TRIAL

08:29:42.718 --> 08:29:44.253
LAWYERS ARE TO SEE BUSINESS

08:29:44.320 --> 08:29:45.888
USING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

08:29:45.955 --> 08:29:47.423
THE TRIAL LAWYERS CALL ONE OF

08:29:47.490 --> 08:29:49.058
THE CONTRACTORS IN GETS AND OR

08:29:49.125 --> 08:29:50.459
HER TO AGREE TO SOME FREE MONEY

08:29:50.526 --> 08:29:52.395
TO FILE A LAWSUIT. THE TRIAL

08:29:52.461 --> 08:29:53.829
LAWYER SENDS A DEMAND LETTER TO

08:29:53.896 --> 08:29:55.264
THE BUSINESS SAYING A LAWSUIT

BILL. I'M A PROUD SUPPORTER OF

THIS BILL I THINK THAT. WHICH

08:35:54.023 --> 08:35:56.025
WE DIDN'T HAVE A COURT DECISION

08:35:56.091 --> 08:35:57.793
TO DO THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION

08:35:57.860 --> 08:35:58.394
TO PROBABLY WOULD HAVE. HELPED

08:35:58.460 --> 08:36:04.400
IF WE- CODE OF. GONE THROUGH IN

08:36:04.466 --> 08:36:06.435
A VERY COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO

DISCUSS THE ISSUES AND DO A

08:36:09.271 --> 08:36:12.908
GREAT GRAN PIECE OF LEGISLATION

THAT FURTHERS SO. A NEW ISSUE

08:36:16.445 --> 08:36:18.480
THAT'S VERY THAT'S KIND OF BEEN

08:36:18.547 --> 08:36:20.049
HANGING OVER CALIFORNIA FOR

08:36:20.115 --> 08:36:21.750
QUITE A LONG TIME I'M I'M A

08:36:21.817 --> 08:36:24.420
CALIFORNIA NATIVE AND I'VE SEEN

08:36:24.486 --> 08:36:25.621
CALIFORNIA CHANGE AND ONE OF

08:36:25.688 --> 08:36:27.323
THINGS I'M MOST PROUD OF. OF

08:36:27.389 --> 08:36:29.858
OUR STATE IS THE DIVERSITY WE

08:36:29.925 --> 08:36:31.226
HAVE IN OUR STATE THE DIVERSITY

08:36:31.293 --> 08:36:34.930
OF AREAS CULTURES THE FACT THAT

08:36:34.997 --> 08:36:38.534
WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE FROM ALL

08:36:38.600 --> 08:36:40.069
OVER THE WORLD LIVING HERE

08:36:40.135 --> 08:36:42.071
LANGUAGES AND MY DISTRICT AND

08:36:42.137 --> 08:36:44.273
SALAS A WE HAVE TO SO MANY

08:36:44.340 --> 08:36:45.607
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BEING

08:36:45.674 --> 08:36:48.010
SPOKEN. IN THE IN OUR

08:36:48.077 --> 08:36:50.346
COMMUNITIES BUT I THINK YOU DO

08:36:50.412 --> 08:36:52.214
WITH THAT DIVERSITY AND WITH

08:36:52.281 --> 08:36:54.383
THAT THAT THAT THE ENVIRONMENT

08:36:54.450 --> 08:36:57.086
I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT

08:36:57.152 --> 08:37:00.055
THIS BILL REALLY ADDRESSES AND

08:37:00.122 --> 08:37:01.423
THAT IS THAT WE DON'T WANT

08:37:01.490 --> 08:37:04.093
PEOPLE CHEATED OR EXPLOITED OR

08:37:04.159 --> 08:37:06.228
ARE NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR WAGE

08:37:06.295 --> 08:37:07.262
AND NOT GETTING THE BENEFITS

08:37:07.329 --> 08:37:10.632
THAT THEY SHOULD DESERVE. AND

08:37:10.699 --> 08:37:14.370
IT SHOULD BE BASED ON. THOSE

08:37:14.436 --> 08:37:15.437
KINDS OF STANDARDS THAT ARE

08:37:15.504 --> 08:37:18.040
AMBIGUOUS WE SHOULD HAVE CLEAR

08:37:18.107 --> 08:37:19.007
STANDARDS AND I THINK THAT'S

08:37:19.074 --> 08:37:20.976
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. THAT

08:37:21.043 --> 08:37:23.112
THIS BILL DOES THE OTHER THE

08:37:23.178 --> 08:37:24.713
OTHER ISSUE I WANT TO RAISE AND

08:37:24.780 --> 08:37:27.049
I THINK IT'S BEEN RAISED BY. MY

08:37:27.116 --> 08:37:28.317
COLLEAGUES IS TO CALIFORNIA

08:37:28.384 --> 08:37:31.787
REALLY HAS. ONE OF THE HIGHEST

08:37:31.854 --> 08:37:34.156
ON THE HIGHEST RATES OF POVERTY.

08:37:34.223 --> 08:37:36.558
IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE A

08:37:36.625 --> 08:37:38.694
SUCH A HIGH RATE OF POVERTY WE

08:37:38.761 --> 08:37:40.396
HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE

08:37:40.462 --> 08:37:43.966
LIVING. ADD POVERTY OR ABOUT TO

08:37:44.032 --> 08:37:46.835
BE ON POVERTY. AND SO ARE WE

08:37:46.902 --> 08:37:48.203
LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THIS ISSUE

08:37:48.270 --> 08:37:49.805
WITH THIS BILL WE SHOULD PAY

08:37:49.872 --> 08:37:52.040
VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO

08:37:52.107 --> 08:37:54.009
PROTECTING THEIR WAGES THEIR

08:37:54.076 --> 08:37:56.845
BENEFITS. AND STANDING UP FOR

08:37:56.912 --> 08:37:59.214
THOSE FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT IF

08:37:59.281 --> 08:38:02.184
WE DON'T STAND UP FOR WILL SLIP

08:38:02.251 --> 08:38:03.352
EVEN FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO

08:38:03.419 --> 08:38:05.921
POVERTY. I THINK THERE'S MORE

08:38:05.988 --> 08:38:07.055
WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL

08:38:07.122 --> 08:38:13.295
I'M SURE. IS SUCH A GRAND.

08:38:13.362 --> 08:38:15.764
GRAND MOVEMENT I CALL IT. I

08:38:15.831 --> 08:38:18.600
WANTED TO POINT OUT. SOME WORK

08:38:18.667 --> 08:38:20.436
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON

08:38:20.502 --> 08:38:22.171
INDUSTRIES LIKE THE TRUCKING

08:38:22.237 --> 08:38:25.607
INDUSTRY THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH

08:38:25.674 --> 08:38:26.842
THIS CHAIR OF THE

08:38:26.909 --> 08:38:28.076
TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I

08:38:28.143 --> 08:38:30.779
POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS HERE.

08:38:30.846 --> 08:38:32.648
WE GOT A GOOD START WITH THE

08:38:32.714 --> 08:38:35.651
CONSTRUCTION AMENDMENT I THINK

08:38:35.717 --> 08:38:37.686
THERE'S MANY OWNER OPERATORS

08:38:37.753 --> 08:38:41.290
STAT RUN FREIGHT SO OF HAULING

08:38:41.356 --> 08:38:42.958

TO UPGRADE THEIR TRUCKS OR EVEN

08:39:02.377 --> 08:39:04.279
BUY NEW TRUCKS. SO THERE'S A

08:39:04.346 --> 08:39:05.380
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DEBT

08:39:05.447 --> 08:39:08.584

I WANTED TO. KIND OF SUMMARIZE

08:42:20.342 --> 08:42:21.176
SOME THOUGHTS IN IN FIRST OF

08:42:21.243 --> 08:42:21.710
ALL AGREE WITH OUR GOOD

08:42:21.777 --> 08:42:22.310
COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS. WHEN

08:42:22.377 --> 08:42:22.944
SHE STATED THAT THE REASON THAT

08:42:23.011 --> 08:42:23.612
WE'RE HERE TONIGHT AND IN THIS

08:42:23.679 --> 08:42:25.180
SITUATION IS BECAUSE OF A COURT

08:42:25.247 --> 08:42:27.115
CASE. IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

08:42:27.182 --> 08:42:29.151
COURT AND WHAT CONCERNS ME

08:42:29.217 --> 08:42:32.754
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE CASE. AS

08:42:32.821 --> 08:42:34.289
HAS BEEN EXPLAINED AND I AGREE

08:42:34.356 --> 08:42:35.791
WITH THE DYNAMAX WAS ABOUT

08:42:35.857 --> 08:42:38.427
OPERATOR ACCORDING TO THE LAW

08:42:38.493 --> 08:42:40.395
AT THE TIME REGARDING EMPLOYEES

08:42:40.462 --> 08:42:42.597
VERSES INDEPENDENT OPERATORS.

08:42:42.664 --> 08:42:46.034
IN MY OPINION THE SUPREME COURT

08:42:46.101 --> 08:42:46.668
AT THAT POINT TIME SHOULD HAVE

08:42:46.735 --> 08:42:48.503
JUST DEALT WITH THE DYNAMAX.

08:42:48.570 --> 08:42:50.639
ANNA JUDICATA WHAT THEIR

08:42:50.706 --> 08:42:57.479
PENALTY AND WAS FOR THEIR-

08:42:57.546 --> 08:42:58.113
MISGIVINGS AND THEY'RE BREAKING

08:42:58.180 --> 08:43:01.149
OF THE LAW. BUT WHAT RISES TO A

08:43:01.216 --> 08:43:03.752
HIGHER CONCERN FOR ME IS. HOW

08:43:03.819 --> 08:43:08.423
BAD THIS DECISION REALLY IS.

08:43:08.490 --> 08:43:09.891
BASED ON LAW BASED ON

08:43:09.958 --> 08:43:10.959
APPLICATION BASED ON WHAT

08:43:11.026 --> 08:43:15.864
REALLY HAPPENED. I'M AFRAID.

08:43:15.931 --> 08:43:18.400
THERE AS THIS CASE IS STUDIED

08:43:18.467 --> 08:43:20.602
IN LAW SCHOOLS AND IN TEXT

08:43:20.669 --> 08:43:22.437
BOOKS AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS

08:43:22.504 --> 08:43:24.005
IS GONNA GO DOWN IN HISTORY OR

08:43:24.072 --> 08:43:25.907
AT LEAST MODERN HISTORY IS ONE

08:43:25.974 --> 08:43:28.810
OF THE VERY WORST DECISIONS AT%

08:43:28.877 --> 08:43:30.912
THIS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

08:43:30.979 --> 08:43:34.349
HAS EVER MADE AND WE GET ON THE

08:43:34.416 --> 08:43:34.950
BILL. AND I THINK A LOT OF US

08:43:35.016 --> 08:43:37.419
ACTUALLY AGREE ON THAT. BUT

08:43:37.486 --> 08:43:38.987
WHAT WE CONCERNS ME EVEN MORE

08:43:39.054 --> 08:43:40.689
THAN THAT. IS THERE WAS A

08:43:40.756 --> 08:43:45.060
UNANIMOUS DECISION. WE HAVE

08:43:45.127 --> 08:43:49.197
SEVEN HIGHLY TRAINED COMPETENT

08:43:49.264 --> 08:43:49.798
SINCE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

08:43:49.865 --> 08:43:53.468
JUSTICES. THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE

08:43:53.535 --> 08:43:56.404
OF THEM GOT THIS DECISION WRONG.

08:43:56.471 --> 08:43:57.005
AND THE CONCERN FOR ME ON THAT

08:43:57.072 --> 08:44:01.243
IS. WHERE IS THE FREEDOM OF

08:44:01.309 --> 08:44:01.777
THOUGHT ON THE CALIFORNIA

08:44:01.843 --> 08:44:05.013
SUPREME COURT. WHERE IS THE

08:44:05.080 --> 08:44:07.749
DEBATE AMONGST OUR OUR CO EQUAL

08:44:07.816 --> 08:44:10.619
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. BUT NOT

08:44:10.685 --> 08:44:13.021
EVEN ONE DESCENDED ON THIS BAD

08:44:13.088 --> 08:44:18.560
DECISION. THAT BRINGS US HERE

08:44:18.627 --> 08:44:22.497
TONIGHT AND. AND I I'M ACTUALLY

08:44:22.564 --> 08:44:24.065
LESS CRITICAL OF THE

08:44:24.132 --> 08:44:26.902
LEGISLATURE IN THIS PROCESS AND

08:44:26.968 --> 08:44:28.670
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AUTHOR I

08:44:28.737 --> 08:44:30.071
THINK HAS GOOD INTENTIONS IN

08:44:30.138 --> 08:44:32.307
THE IN THE EXEMPTIONS THAT THAT

08:44:32.374 --> 08:44:34.543
THEY'RE TRYING TO OFFER. BUT

08:44:34.609 --> 08:44:36.845
YOU JUST CAN'T EXIT YOU THIS IS

08:44:36.912 --> 08:44:40.248
NOT POSSIBLE. TO MANAGE AN

08:44:40.315 --> 08:44:42.150
ENTIRE TWO TRILLION DOLLAR

08:44:42.217 --> 08:44:44.386
ECONOMY FROM THIS LEGISLATIVE

08:44:44.452 --> 08:44:49.925
BODY IS NOT POSSIBLE. I DO HAVE

08:44:49.991 --> 08:44:51.493
SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT

08:44:51.560 --> 08:44:53.295
THE ON INTENT OR MAYBE EVEN

08:44:53.361 --> 08:44:54.830
INTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE

08:44:54.896 --> 08:44:59.935
BILL. SO IF I MAY MANTRAS I

08:45:00.001 --> 08:45:02.504
WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR

08:45:02.571 --> 08:45:05.307
GENUINE QUESTION REGARDING THE

08:45:05.373 --> 08:45:08.210
CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL. DO

08:45:08.276 --> 08:45:10.245
YOU WISH TO TAKE A QUESTION

08:45:10.312 --> 08:45:12.914
SENATOR TRYING YES I'M JUST

08:45:12.981 --> 08:45:14.482
WONDERING IF IT HAD BEEN

08:45:14.549 --> 08:45:16.418
DISCUSSED IN IN IT BECAUSE I

08:45:16.484 --> 08:45:17.285
KNOW I WASN'T INANY THE

08:45:17.352 --> 08:45:18.186
HEARINGS ON THIS PARTICULAR

08:45:18.253 --> 08:45:22.424
BILL. BUT WHEN IT COMES TIME

08:45:22.490 --> 08:45:23.959
FOR THE FOLKS THAT ARE THERE

08:45:24.025 --> 08:45:24.993
THAT ARE NOW GOING TO BE UNDER

08:45:25.060 --> 08:45:27.562
THIS BILL AND DON'T HAVE AN

08:45:27.629 --> 08:45:30.465

08:48:02.384 --> 08:48:06.354
AMBITIOUS GOAL. BUT WE JUST

DREAMERS OF GROWING AND WORKING

HARD TO START IS BUSINESS AND

08:49:42.484 --> 08:49:44.219
BE ABLE TO HIRE SOMEBODY SOME

08:49:44.285 --> 08:49:45.753
DAY AND BE LIKE SOME OF THE

BUSINESS. I'VE WORRIED ABOUT

08:49:49.124 --> 08:49:51.059
HAVING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE

08:49:51.126 --> 08:49:52.894
ONLY INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN ENTER

08:49:52.961 --> 08:49:54.395
THE PIPELINE OF THE TRUCKING

08:49:54.462 --> 08:49:56.931
INDUSTRY WOULD BE EITHER

08:49:56.998 --> 08:49:58.766
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE A LOT OF

08:49:58.833 --> 08:50:00.902
MONEY TO BUY A LOT OF TRUCKS

08:50:00.969 --> 08:50:03.037
AND START A BUSINESS OR

08:50:03.104 --> 08:50:07.408
INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD INHERIT.

08:50:07.475 --> 08:50:12.413
A BUSINESS FROM THEIR PARENTS.

08:50:12.480 --> 08:50:12.981
BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS WORKED

08:50:13.047 --> 08:50:14.949
HARD. SO I WAS PREPARED TO KNOW

08:50:15.016 --> 08:50:15.550
TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL TODAY

08:50:15.617 --> 08:50:16.618
FOR THAT REASON AND SOME OTHERS

08:54:48.289 --> 08:54:50.925
IN THAT CONVERSATION. THERE'S A

08:54:50.992 --> 08:54:53.060
LOT OF THINGS IN LAWS THAT WE

08:54:53.127 --> 08:54:54.695
WOULD NOT HAVE IN PLACE TO

08:54:54.762 --> 08:54:57.465
PROTECT WORKERS IN BUSINESSES.

08:54:57.532 --> 08:54:58.800

KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS

08:55:23.357 --> 08:55:26.727
WE WOULD ANTICIPATE DOING.

08:55:26.794 --> 08:55:29.030
BECAUSE IT IT WAS FOUND TO BE

08:55:29.096 --> 08:55:30.932
WAY MORE COMPLEX THAN I THINK

08:55:30.998 --> 08:55:33.601
ANY OF US IMAGINED. SO OF THE

08:55:33.668 --> 08:55:36.003
OF THE STORIES THAT CAME OUT

08:55:36.070 --> 08:55:38.806
TONIGHT THAT WE'RE GONNA. PUT

08:55:38.873 --> 08:55:40.875
INTO THE PROCESS OF DISCUSSION

08:55:40.942 --> 08:55:41.509
WITH STAKEHOLDERS WHICH IS WHAT

08:55:41.576 --> 08:55:44.712
WE SHOULD DO. THE STAKEHOLDERS

08:55:44.779 --> 08:55:47.181
THE TENSION THE DISCUSSION

08:55:47.248 --> 08:55:48.483
MAKES HAS COME FORWARD WITH A

08:55:48.549 --> 08:55:51.719
BETTER PROCESS. AND SO I WILL

08:55:51.786 --> 08:55:53.721
JUST THANK THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

08:55:53.788 --> 08:55:56.424

08:56:02.697 --> 08:56:04.031
AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WOULD

08:56:04.098 --> 08:56:05.233
LIKE IT TO BE A DIFFERENT KIND

08:56:05.299 --> 08:56:06.968
