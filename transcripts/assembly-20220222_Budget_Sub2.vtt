00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:13.009
AT WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS THE CAP

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:15.311
AT JUST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PER

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.813
ADA- AND THAT'S WHAT. WAS

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.715
INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY ONE

00:55:18.782 --> 00:55:19.783
TWENTY TWO BUT AT TWENTY ONE

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:22.052
BUDGET ACT. TWENTY ONE TWENTY

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:22.886
TWO BUDGET ACTING MANY YEARS

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:25.655
COMPUTERS- AND SO THE WAY THAT

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:27.657
THE FUNDING WHEN OUT IN HERE ONE

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.392
WITH IT WAS APPROXIMATELY A

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:32.395
SIXTY FORTY SPLIT- SO 60% OF THE

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:34.397
FUNDS PROVIDED IN THE FIRST YEAR

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:36.232
OF THE PROGRAM WENT TO ELEAZAR

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:39.002
ABOVE BATTER ABOVE 80% UCBCP.

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:42.772
AND THE RED THE REMAINING FUNDS

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:44.708
WENT TO THOSE BELOW AND IN THE

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:46.676
END THAT WE YOU KNOW WE MODELED-

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:48.011
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT I'M KIND

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:51.948
OF IN FUNDING RATES PER ADA- AND

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.650
WE ENDED UP IN. VARIOUS OPTIONS

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:54.784
FOR DIFFERENT UNDUPLICATED

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:56.920
PEOPLE PERCENTILE CUT OFF AS

00:55:56.986 --> 00:55:59.923
WELL SO- WHAT WE LANDED AT IS

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:02.158
THAT KEEPING IT KEEPING THE RATE

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:03.893
ONE THE TIER ONE- AT TWENTY

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.097
FIVE. HUNDRED AND PROVIDING A

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:08.698
SIXTY FORTY SPLIT IN YEAR TWO OF

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:11.101
THE PROGRAM- IF WE SHIFTED THAT

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:14.170
80% U. P. P. 275% THE FUNDING

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:16.239
WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED. D. FORTY

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:17.874
SPLIT THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:19.776
IT BUT IT ALSO ALLOWED US WITH

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:21.010
THE BIGGER BUCKET OF MONEY SORRY

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:23.513
THERE'S AN AIRPLANE GOING BY.

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.081
ABOUT WITH THE WITH A FOUR POINT

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:26.549
FOUR BILLION ONGOING VERSUS THE

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:32.689
ONE BILLION. I'M GOING- THE

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:33.957
FUNDING RATE EIGHTY FOUR THE

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:35.458
TIER ONE AS A FIVE PER OR ABOVE

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:36.459
WOULD BE A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:37.894
AND A MUCH HIGHER FUNDING RATE.

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:39.662
FOR THE TIER TWO- ORDER WAS

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:41.664
BELOW SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT.

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:43.099
UNDUPLICATED PEOPLE PERCENTAGE-

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:45.168
THEY WOULD RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.870
TWO THOUSAND THAT EXACT. THAT

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:50.206
EXACT NUMBER- WILL BE SUBJECT TO

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:52.342
CHANGE THE BIRTH THE TWO

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:54.511
THOUSAND THE SECOND NUMBER ONCE-

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:56.713
ONCE THE CITY EVEN ACTUAL

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:57.781
NUMBERS ARE REPORTED FOR

00:56:57.847 --> 00:57:02.051
ATTENDANCE- FROM CD BUT- THAT IS

00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:06.689
OUR ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW. AND THEN

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:08.057
HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO WHAT

00:57:08.124 --> 00:57:11.194
THE- THAT SO THIS IS THE RIGHT

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:12.929
THIS ISN'T A TOLERATE SO THIS IS

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:15.365
THE RATE. THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:16.966
FROM THE STATE PERSON STATE AND

00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:19.702
THEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE.

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:22.138
PARENT FEES I GUESS MATCH WOULD

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:24.207
BE. BUT BUT THE WOULD BE

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:26.242
NECESSARY TO FILL. THE FELLOW

00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:28.278
BACK ENTIRELY IS THIS AN

00:57:28.344 --> 00:57:30.213
ADEQUATE AMOUNT FROM THE STATE'S

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.481
PERSPECTIVE TO MAKE SURE WE

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:34.017
DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW BURDENSOME

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:36.786
FEES- ESPECIALLY WHEN WE KNOW

00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:38.488
THAT. WE HAVE MINIMUM WAGE

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:41.624
INCREASES AND POTENTIAL ANOTHER

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:42.992
ONE LOOMING. SO IN A MAKE SURE

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:45.528
THESE PENCIL OUT AND ANSWERED OF

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:51.634
FAMILIES. YEAH THE WAY THAT THE

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:53.036
PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY- STRUCTURED

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:54.637
WAY WE ENVISION IT IN THE

00:57:54.704 --> 00:57:57.073
STATUTE IS THAT IT IS- PROVIDED

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.709
REGARDLESS- REGARDLESS OF

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:00.944
COMMUNITY DEMOGRAPHICS ALL

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.779
PARENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.214
LOW COST IT'LL BE ANOTHER

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.082
SLIDING FEE SCALE SIMILAR TO THE

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:08.184
WAY A SENSE AND- TWENTY FIRST

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.019
CENTURY IS STRUCTURED. TWENTY

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:11.688
FIRST CENTURY PROGRAMMING

00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:13.223
INSTRUCTOR. AND THE DIFFERENCE

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:15.625
WITH THAT YELLOW P. PROGRAM. I'M

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:17.126
GETTING BETTER AT SAYING NOT

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:19.462
SAYING YOU OP- SO THE DIFFERENCE

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:21.965
AT THAT IS THAT- THIS PROGRAM IS

00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:25.435
FUNDED- BASED ON YOU PP

00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:28.004
ATTENDANCE AT THE L. EA. SO IT'S

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:29.973
AT BUT IT'S NOT. THE FUNDING OF

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:31.007
THE PROVIDING FOR PARTICIPATION

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.675
IN THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY SO

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:34.510
YOU GET A HIGHER FUNDING RATE

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:36.279
SINCE THE FUNDING IS BASED ON

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:41.618
THAT ELEAZAR YOU PP. OKAY AND

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:43.519
THEN LET'S LET'S GO ON TO THE

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:46.089
UNIVERSAL ASPECT OF IT I THINK

00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:47.156
THAT'S ONE THING THAT THE

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:48.157
MEMBERS REALLY APPRECIATE

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:50.026
WHETHER IT'S BEST. FOR

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:51.995
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IS

00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:53.796
HAVING A PROGRAM THAT'S FOR

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:56.299
EVERYBODY- SO YOU DON'T SQUEEZE

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:59.068
OUT. MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO

00:58:59.135 --> 00:59:00.770
YOU KNOW ARE JUST TOO RICH TO

00:59:00.837 --> 00:59:02.705
QUALIFY FOR FREE BUT DON'T HAVE

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:04.407
ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR IT THEY

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:06.542
THE PROGRAM THEMSELVES. SO

00:59:06.609 --> 00:59:07.877
THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING IS

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:10.113
VERY ATTRACTIVE TO US SO HOW DO

00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:13.583
WE ANTICIPATE. THAT THIS REVIEW-

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:14.851
BEING IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE TO

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:17.954
MAKE SURE IT'S UNIVERSAL FOR ALL

00:59:18.021 --> 00:59:20.757
KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.158
QUESTION IS FOR ME AGAIN YOU'RE

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:26.562
GONNA. AT- SO. THE WAY THAT THE

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:28.531
WE ENVISION THIS PROGRAM WORKING

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:30.166
WE SEE IT AS A COMPREHENSIVE

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:32.602
PROGRAM THAT IS THAT BRAIDS KIND

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:34.771
OF THE ASUS PROGRAM THE TWENTY

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:36.572
FIRST CENTURY FUNDS THAT- ELLIE

00:59:36.639 --> 00:59:38.441
IS RECEIVED AND BECAUSE FIVE YOU

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:39.575
KNOW AT LEAST RECEIVE FUNDING

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:40.209
THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:41.544
FUNDING FORMULA THEY CAN

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:42.979
LEVERAGE. OTHER SOURCES OF

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:46.149
FUNDING TO SUPPLEMENT- THE

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:47.784
AVAILABILITY OF PROGRAMMING FOR

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:50.954
EXTENDED LEARNING SERVICES-

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.855
BECAUSE LIKE I LIKE I SAID AT

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:53.723
THE BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS IT

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:54.324
FUNDED BASED ON STUDENT

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.092
PARTICIPATION. THE EFFECTIVE

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:57.493
FUNDING RATE PER STUDENT WAS

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.361
REALLY GONNA DEPEND ON THE

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.562
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT RECEIVE

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.931
ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM- AND I

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:02.999
THINK OUR ESTIMATES AND ELLY

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.600
ELLS ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT A

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:05.668
LIKELY BE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:08.638
PROVIDE ACCESS. 62% OF ALL KIDS

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:11.307
T. THREE T. K. THREE SIX UP ON

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:13.176
GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:17.513
WOULD COVER ALL- AND DUPLICATED

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.482
PEOPLE PEOPLE'S. ALL RIGHT CAN I

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.551
GET A MISTER FUNK ON THE ON THE

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:24.620
- UP HERE. AND I CALL. I'M HERE

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:26.689
IS YES- MAY YOU COULD ADDRESS

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:29.692
THE TO TWO ISSUES THAT FIRST ONE

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:33.262
IS- THE UNIVERSAL PERSPECTIVE.

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.365
FOR ALL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA HOW

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:36.666
DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:38.735
SOMETHING THAT WE DELIVERED THE

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.503
PROMISE FROM. OUR LAST YEAR'S

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:47.276
BUDGET ACTION. IT'S A IT'S- AS

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:50.947
WE'VE GOT- A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:53.416
OF LIAISE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:54.550
AGENCIES THAT HAVE NEVER

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:56.319
OPERATED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.054
BEFORE THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY

01:00:58.121 --> 01:00:59.789
SINCE OUR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.824
FUNDING. AND QUITE FRANKLY OF

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:03.760
MANY OF THEM ARE ASKING IF THEY

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:05.028
HAVE TO DO THIS THEY HAVE TO

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:07.864
TAKE THE BODY AND SO ARE BIG

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:11.801
CHALLENGE HAS BEEN. TO MATCH UP

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:13.536
THESE NEW LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:16.506
AGENCIES WHICH QUITE FRANKLY

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:17.874
HAVE A LOT OF THINGS ON THEIR

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.075
PLATE RIGHT NOW WITH ALL THE

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.344
CHALLENGES OF STAFF IN SCHOOLS

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.680
IN KEEPING SCHOOLS OPEN AND THE

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.516
OVERCROWDED AND THE CHALLENGES

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.718
AND TO GET THEM TO THINK OF AN

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:30.086
AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM HAS BEEN A

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:32.388
CHALLENGE. BUT WE'RE DOING WE'RE

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:34.924
TRYING TO MATCH. DISTRICTS WHO

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:37.894
ARE RELUCTANT. OR HESITANT.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.495
PASSED WITH DISTRICTS YOU REALLY

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:40.897
HAVE A VISION FOR OUR AFTER

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:42.799
SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND EXPANDED

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:45.701
LEARNING PROGRAMS. CAN BE A

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:48.571
CRITICAL ELEMENT TO SUPPORT

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:52.008
EQUITY TO SUPPORT- OPPORTUNITIES

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:53.342
FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT HAVE

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:59.482
THE UP THE ADVANTAGES. SO- THE

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.150
AND THIS DOES DOES BLEED INTO

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.486
THE- THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:07.423
RATES. BECAUSE OF IS TWENTY FIVE

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.293
HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO GET STUDENT

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.462
ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS UNIVERSAL

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.263
FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN TIER ONE

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.966
THE PROPOSAL A 5% AND ABOVE AND

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.501
TO PUT IT. THE CLEANER FROM

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.368
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.838
ACCURATE. THAT IT ALL DEPENDS ON

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.773
HOW MANY STUDENTS COME AND RIGHT

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.508
NOW WE HAVE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.777
AGENCIES. WHO ARE MODELING

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:32.181
THINGS OUT. AND SOMEONE JUST

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.784
THROWING UP THEIR HANDS AND SAY

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:35.384
THIS IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY IT'S

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:37.687
NOT GOING TO WORK. BECAUSE THEY

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:40.723
ARE CALCULATING- THEY'RE

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:43.359
CALCULATING IF EVERY STUDENT

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.628
THAT CAN COME WILL COME WE'RE

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:46.829
NOT GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.331
AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET FOLKS TO

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:49.765
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:51.567
LIKELY TO HAPPEN I MEAN I'VE

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:53.536

YEARS TWENTY YEARS IN THE BAY

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:59.442
AREA ENGINEERS HERE AT CD. AND-

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:01.744
UNIVERSAL DOES NOT BE UNIVERSAL

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:03.246
ACCESS DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.014
STUDENT CAN COME WILL IT JUST

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:07.216
DOESN'T DOESN'T MEET THE NEEDS

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:10.953
FOR SOME FAMILIES. SO RIGHT NOW-

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.688
I THINK THE WAY TO GET TO

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:15.758
UNIVERSAL. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:18.661

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:29.972
NOT GONNA HAPPEN THROUGH AN

IS THE IS THE- THE SALARIES AND

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.148

JUST FOR MY OWN KIDS. THEIR NON

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:31.827
. GRADE WHEN THEY'RE IN

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:33.496
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THEY HAD AT.

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:34.897
THEIR PROGRAM HERE BEFORE THE

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:37.433
PANDEMIC. AND THEY WENT THROUGH

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.568
A LOT OF STAFF HERE IN THERE

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:41.637
BECAUSE THAT THE- WORKERS. YOU

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:42.905

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:44.607
COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE YOU KNOW.

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:46.575
LATE TEENS EARLY TWENTIES. THEY

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:47.710
COULD MAKE MORE GOING AND

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.012
WORKING AT STARBUCKS OR YOU KNOW

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:52.882
SOMEWHERE ELSE. THAN THEY COULD.

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:54.617
IN THIS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:58.654
AND THE CDVA UTILIZZARE YOUR

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.022
PAST ASSET WHICH IS YOUR

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:02.491
WORKFORCE. SO DO YOU DO YOU

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:05.594
THINK. THAT THEIR RATES WE HAVE

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:07.129
HERE. ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:08.964
SURE WE HAVE. HIGH QUALITY

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.833
PROGRAMS WE CAN BRING IN THE

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.835
COACHING OTHERS TO MAKE SURE

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:16.005
THEY'RE- STABILIZED AND VALUABLE

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:19.375
FOR THE COMMUNITIES THEY THEY'RE

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.510
THEY'RE TEND TO SERVE. I'LL TAKE

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:24.747
THAT A TUTOR FOR WAYS MISTER.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.882
FIRST OF ALL AS LEADER FROM THE

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:28.584
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.454
IT IS THE INTENT. THAT ACES IN

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.756
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. M. THE

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.157
EXPELLER IN OPPORTUNITIES

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:36.826
PROGRAM IS ONE COMPREHENSIVE

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:39.795
PROGRAM THIS IS TAKEN A BIT FOR.

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.831
LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:45.735
GET THEIR HEAD AROUND- BUT

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:47.536
INSTEAD OF THINKING OF BASIS

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:48.938
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND ELO P.

01:06:49.004 --> 01:06:50.740
EVEN IF THEY'RE STRUCTURED

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:53.676
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY. I SEE A

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:55.845
CLEAR WAY THE DATES CAN BE

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:58.414
CONSIDERED. THREE DIFFERENT

01:06:58.481 --> 01:06:59.682
FUNDING STREAMS FOR ONE

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:01.684
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM AND IN SO

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:06.989
DOING- WE CAN INCREASE. THE

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:09.558
AMOUNT OF THE WAGES AB AND PAY

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.293
PEOPLE MORE AT THE SENATE

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.830
HEARING- ANY READING FROM YOUR

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:16.198
UNIFIED HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:18.667
THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING USE THIS

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.035
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MAKE SURE

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:21.937
THAT THEY'RE GIVING OUT RATE

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:25.574
INCREASES FOR PAY FOR STAFF AND

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:28.411
FOR SITE COORDINATORS- SOME

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:29.879
MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.647
CONSIDERING CAN WE BRING OUR

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.482
CYCLE COORDINATORS ON AS A FULL

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.618
TIME. POSITION MAYBE EVEN WITH

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:38.888
BENEFITS SO THIS BECOMES MORE OF

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:40.856
A CAREER PATH. I THINK THE

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:43.926
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THESE.

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:46.796
STREAMS BLEND TOGETHER- IS WORTH

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.631
A LOT OF CONVERSATION MAYBE NOT

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:49.832
FOR THIS HEARING BUT WE'RE AS WE

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.935
WORK WITH- FINANCE AND

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:54.837
LEGISLATIVE STAFF WE HAVE SOME

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.006
IDEAS OF MAYBE SOME TWEAKS THAT

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.140
NEED TO HAPPEN IN THE ACES AND

01:07:58.207 --> 01:08:00.276
CODE IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TO

01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:01.510
MAKE SURE THAT THESE CAN BE MORE

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:03.212
COMPATIBLE THERE FUNDAMENTALLY

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:04.947
STRUCTURED IN DIFFERENT FUNDING

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.649
MODELS WERE WITH ACES IT'S VERY

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:08.651
CLEAR YOU'VE GOT A DAILY RATE

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:12.188
PER CHILD YOU'VE GOT ATTENDANCE.

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:14.857
GOALS THAT ARE SET BY STATE YOU

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.392
YOUR TARGET GOALS ARE FOR

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:18.994
ATTENDANCE AND YELLOW PIAS VERY

01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:24.633
MUCH ABOUT OCT- ACCESS AND-

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.802
PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES BUT

01:08:26.869 --> 01:08:28.671
ATTENDANCE IS LEFT TO THE

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:30.506
DISCRETION OF THE FAMILY. THE

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.641
SECOND POINT THOUGH I THINK THAT

01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:33.976
. WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS IN

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:35.911
TERMS OF WORK FORCE BECAUSE THAT

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:37.179
IS THE ISSUE THAT IS THE

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:38.848
UNIVERSAL. CHALLENGE WE'RE

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:40.783
HEARING FROM SMALLER DISTRICTS

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.518
RURAL LARGE DISTRICTS IS

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:44.487
WORKFORCE AND THAT'S NOT

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.522
DISSIMILAR TO IN THE INDUSTRY.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:50.926
IN IN OUR COUNTRY. OR THE WORLD

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:53.529
- MY CONTENTION IS IF WE'RE JUST

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:54.930
TRYING TO MATCH WHAT IS YOUR

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:57.500
HOURLY RAGE IN COMPETITION WITH

01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.135
STARBUCKS. OR SOME OTHER-

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:02.705
BUSINESS NOT TO PLUG ANYONE

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:05.608
BUSINESS BUT- ALL BUSINESSES

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:07.743
PULLING OUT THE STOPS TO MAKE

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.378
THEIR BUSINESS MORE ATTRACTIVE

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:12.982
HIGHER WAGE MORE BENEFITS. WE'RE

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.650
GOING TO LOSE THAT COMPETITION.

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:16.986
BUT IF WE FRAME THIS. AS NOT

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:20.389
JUST. A LIVABLE AND MORE THAN

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:22.858
LIVABLE WAGE. BUT AS A ENTRY

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:25.561
POINT AND GATEWAY TO A CAREER IN

01:09:25.628 --> 01:09:27.696
EDUCATION. THAT WE CAN MAKE

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:31.066
EXPANDED LEARNING TIME COUNT FOR

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:33.969
TEACHER PREPARATION HOURS- WE'VE

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.571
BEEN DOING SOME WORK WITH. THE

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.006
CREDENTIALING FOLKS IN WITH

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:39.842
HIGHER EDUCATION. SO THE STAFF

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:43.412
PERSON CAN GET CREDIT TOWARDS

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.114
THEIR TEACHER PREPARATION FOR

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.583
THE TIME THEY SPEND. IT WORKING

EXPAND AS OUR NEEDS- EXPANDED

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:51.820

EDUCATION THIS BECOMES THE

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:09.438
PORTAL THROUGH WHICH THEY CAN

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:12.474

CAREER PATH. THANK YOU THEN THE

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:21.684
LAST QUESTION IS- I THINK IT IS

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:24.086
A BIT CONFUSING WITH ALL OF OUR

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:26.055

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:47.509
FEDERAL MONEY FROM THE TWENTY

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:49.011
FIRST CENTURY AND THEN WE HAVE

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.614
THE EXPANDED LEARNING GRANTS. IT

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.215
WOULD BE A DISASTER IF THESE GO

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:56.051
OUT AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE.

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:58.988
YOU KNOW- BASICALLY- OFFERING

01:10:59.054 --> 01:10:59.922
THESE AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.124
ACRONYMS AND I THINK IT'S SUPER

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:03.892
CONFUSING SO WHAT ARE WE DOING

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.661
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AD AND

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.029
LEVEL I KNOW I LEGISLATION ON

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.565
THIS BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK AS

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:10.165
FAR AS JUST STREAMLINING AND

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:11.400
HAVING. WHAT THREE POTS OF MONEY

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:14.470
GO AND HAVE ONE SIMPLIFIED.

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:16.872
OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:20.609
TO OFFER AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS.

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:22.911
BUT A VERY BASIC LEVEL BECAUSE

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:24.647
IN THIS CURRENT MOMENT IN TIME

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.148
WE STILL HAVE THE DIFFERENT

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:28.550
FUNDING STREAMS WITH DIFFERENT

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.452
SECTIONS OF THE CODE OF COURSE

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:31.787
THERE'S A CORRELATION WHAT WE'RE

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:33.856
DOING IS WE AS I MENTIONED

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:37.593
EARLIER. WE ARE DOING A FINE.

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.628
EDUCATIONAL LEADERS WHO HAVE

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:41.697
FIGURED OUT HOW TO LAND THE

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.532
STREAMS TOGETHER AND BRING THEM

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.501
TOGETHER INTO ONE COMPREHENSIVE

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:48.771
PROGRAM. AND WERE ELEVATED THAT

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:51.040
WERE INTERVIEWING THEM ONLINE

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:53.842
WERE WERE. PRODUCING VIDEO BLOGS

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:54.910
WHERE THEY'RE TELLING THEIR

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:57.546
STORY WE'RE PROVIDING PLACES.

01:11:57.613 --> 01:12:00.082
WHERE PEOPLE CAN GATHER AND

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.784
GOING TO BREAK OUT GROUPS

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:03.585
DISTRICTS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS WHO

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:04.787
ARE STRUGGLING MATCHING THEM

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.188
WITH DISTRICS WHO HAVE FIGURED

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:09.458
THIS OUT- AND THERE ARE SOME

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:11.293
TWEAKS WE NEED TO MAKE UP. IN

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.928
TERMS OF BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:13.996
REALLY ASKING MISTER CHAIRMAN IS

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:16.165
LIKE. WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF THIS

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:17.366
IS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY OF

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:19.001
COURSE TWENTY FOR CENTURIES A

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:21.170
FEDERAL PROGRAM. AND THERE ARE

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.871
LIMITATIONS TO WHAT CHANGES WE

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:24.807
CANMAKE THERE SOME SOME STATE

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:25.974
IMPLEMENTATION FLEXIBILITY AS

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:30.212
WELL. AND MANY IN THE- AFTER

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:32.181
SCHOOL UNIVERSE. HAVE RAISE THE

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.716
CONCERN THAT BECAUSE THE EVIL

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:35.551
PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON T. K.

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:38.754
THREE SIX. THAT ARE OLDER YOUTH

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:42.057
MIGHT BE GETTING- DOCUMENTS THEY

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:43.959
NEED OUR MIDDLE SCHOOL PROGRAM

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.694
USE THAT ARE HIGH SCHOOL HOUSTON

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:47.996
SO. WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:50.065
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW. TO WORK

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:51.633
WITH THESE FUNDING STREAMS IN

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.636
THE FUTURE BECAUSE I THINK- YOUR

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.572
INSTINCTS ARE CORRECT. THE FACT

01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:57.740
THAT WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT

01:12:57.806 --> 01:12:59.641
FUNDING STREAMS THREE ACRONYMS

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:00.676
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TRAINING IN OUR

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:02.578
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FOR A LONG

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:04.513
TIME. TO KEEP THINGS SEPARATE

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.415
DON'T MIX THINGS UP KEEP THINGS

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:08.217
IN SILOS THAT WAY YOU'RE GONNA

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:09.918
FOLLOW ALL THE RULES YOU'RE NOT

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.086
GONNA GET IN TROUBLE. AND THAT'S

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:12.287
NOT GOOD FOR KIDS IT'S NOT GOOD

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:15.524
FOR FAMILIES IN IS CONFUSING FOR

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.326
PARENTS. SO WE'RE VERY OPEN TO

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:19.394

WHAT OUR PARENTS AND STUDENTS

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.738
NEED AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE MOST

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:31.640
BENEFICIAL FOR THAT IS WHERE WE

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:34.276
SHOULD FOCUS AND OF CREATING

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:36.411
SOMETHING THAT'S LESS CONFUSING

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:37.913
AND WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.915
SCHOOL THEY SEE. ONE THE HIGH

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:41.950
QUALITY AFTER SCHOOL SUMMER

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.828
SOMETHING THAT'S HEAVILY BASED

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:54.563
ON SLIDING FEES BECAUSE OUR

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:55.597

EXPENSIVE PROGRAM WITH ONGOING

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:52.721
MONEY. THAT DRIVES DOLLARS AWAY

RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING- AND I CAN

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.602

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:35.797
DISTRICTS EVENLY DECLINING

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.499
ENROLLMENT CODE RELATED

PROPOSED BUDGET YEAH THE

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:54.683
ACTUALLY PROBABLY CLOSER TO

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:59.488
THIRTEEN POINT 8% AND WHAT WE

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:00.889
WANT TO GO OUT AND DO. WHAT I'M

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:03.492

TAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF ON

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.998
GOING MONEY. ON AND THEN WHEN WE

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.433
LOOK AT THE AFTER SCHOOL

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.701
PROGRAMS THE QUALITY VARIES

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:15.037
QUITE FRANKLY THESE ARE OFTEN

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:16.872
COLLEGE KIDS. GREAT KIDS GETTING

THE YOUNGER KIDS THAT'S A GOOD

01:16:19.975 --> 01:16:21.643
THING. BUT AGAIN WE I THINK THE

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.145
QUALITIES- WE DON'T KNOW THE

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:24.813

STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM I

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.796
THINK THAT'S AN UNFORTUNATE

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:41.396
THING I DON'T THINK THIS IS

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:43.799
TOTALLY. BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH.

THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.034
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO PAY CLOSE

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:29.938

IF I FIND THAT UNFORTUNATE- AND

01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.901

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:00.936
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS USE OF

THAT'S EVEN AN APPROPRIATE AND

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:31.867

VANTAGE POINT GUARDS TWENTY

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.268
DIFFERENT MINDSET- I REALLY LOOK

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:42.671
AT NOW SCHOOLS WERE DESIGNED AT

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:45.440
A TIME- IN A VERY DIFFERENT

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.375
PLACE YOU KNOW WE TAKE SUMMERS

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:48.843
OFF SCHOOLS WERE DESIGNED WE GO

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.780
TO SCHOOL BETWEEN NINETY TWO-

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:53.782
FAMILIES WERE DIFFERENT WE

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:55.684
DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:57.619
WORK SCHEDULES NOW- MOST

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.955
FAMILIES. WHO HAVE CHILDREN YOU

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:02.023
HAVE TO WORKING PARENTS THEY

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:04.793
CAN'T AFFORD TO COME PICK UP

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:06.828
THEIR KIDS AT TWO O'CLOCK- THEY

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:08.330
HAVE DIFFICULTY WE HAVE TO

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:09.764
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH OUR

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:10.632
KIDS ALL SUMMER BECAUSE WE

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:13.635
EVERYONE'S WORKING SO THE VISION

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:16.104
I THINK THAT MR FONG CLEAN AND

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:17.939
YOU KNOW I HAD THE DISTINCT

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:19.908
HONOR OF- KNOWING HIM WHEN HE

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:22.944
RAN ARE GREAT- BEACON PROGRAM IN

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:25.914
MY DISTRICT. MANY MANY YEARS AGO

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:28.516
BUT- YOU KNOW REALLY THE VISION

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:31.553
THAT HE LAID OUT WHICH IS YOU

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:35.023
HAVE A SCHOOL DAY THAT IS REALLY

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.359
FROM NINE O'CLOCK UNTIL FIVE

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:37.926
O'CLOCK AND I THINK THAT'S

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:39.728
REALLY WHAT FAMILIES NEED AND

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:40.929
THAT'S REALLY WHAT FAMILIES WANT

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:42.364
AND IF YOU LOOK AT WORKING

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:43.832
FAMILIES ARE MIDDLE CLASS

01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:45.333
FAMILIES OR FAMILIES WHO HAVE

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.936
TO. WORKING PARENTS THAT REALLY

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:52.007
IS THE LONG TERM VISION I THINK

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:55.043
OF WHERE WE HAVE TO GO SO IT'S

01:21:55.110 --> 01:22:00.448
REALLY NOT ABOUT- THIS NOT ABOUT

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:01.816
- THE MONEY ONLY IN THE CLASS

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:02.917
WAS RELEASED THE MONEY AT THE

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:06.821
SCHOOL. AND WHETHER IT IS- AFTER

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:08.490
THE BELL RINGS OR BEFORE THE

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:09.557
BELL RINGS IT'S REALLY ALL

01:22:09.624 --> 01:22:11.459
ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT FAMILIES

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:12.761
AND CHILDREN ARE REALLY GETTING

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:14.529
THAT SUPPORT SO JUST A COUPLE

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.531
COUPLE QUESTIONS- STARTING WITH

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:17.999
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OBVIOUSLY

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:21.002
I THINK OUR OUR SUB CHAIR. ON

01:22:21.069 --> 01:22:23.438
REITERATED THIS POINT- THAT THIS

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:24.973
IS JUST REITERATE THIS IS JUST

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.442
A- IMPLEMENTATION OF LAST

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:28.943
YEAR'S- BUDGET AGREEMENT. BUT IT

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.779
IS A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT OF-

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.247
FINANCES VANTAGE POINT WITH THE

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.948
INCREASED TO FOUR POINT FOUR

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:34.816
BILLION OBVIOUSLY WITH THE GOAL

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:36.951
OF. FIVE BILLION- WHAT'S THE

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:40.255
EXPECTATION THAT THAT THE YOUR

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:42.557

GONNA BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:56.104
THE END OF THIS BUDGET YEAR. I

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:58.573
THINK OUR VISION AS- PER STATUTE

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.241
IT'S TO RAMP UP TO THE FIVE

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:02.510

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:19.260
IMPLEMENTATION HAPPENING OVER A

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:22.497
FEW YEARS- AND- THE AUDIT. YOU

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:25.767

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.405
MASKING MORE FROM A LADY- LEE

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:32.474

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:28.756
MODERATE AREA EARLIER WELL AS

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:31.860
YOU TO- THERE'S DIFFERENT RIGHT

01:25:31.926 --> 01:25:33.261
CALIFORNIA'S VERY DIVERSE WELL

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:36.231
THAT AND SO- DIFFERENT LEDS ARE

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:37.065
GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:37.999
CHALLENGES- SOME OF THEM ARE

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:38.800
GOING TO BE ALREADY

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:39.734
PARTICIPATING IN THE ASUS

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:41.336
PROGRAMS YOU CAN PUNK THERE

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:42.770
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A EASIER TIME

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:43.972
PERHAPS BREEDING FONG FROM

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:45.373
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS GRADING ONE

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.275
COHESIVE. AS WE MISS MCCARTY

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:49.944
SAID AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM RIGHT

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:51.546
THAT PARENTS WOULD KNOW THAT-

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:52.380
EVEN THOUGH THE FUNDING FROM A

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:53.748
STATE PERSPECTIVE COMING FROM

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:54.716
DIFFERENT PARTS MAYBE EVEN

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:57.752
FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL. SO THAT'S

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.754
REALITY AND SO IT'S HARD FOR US

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:00.722
TO FIND IN THE EXACTLY WHAT'S

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:02.090
GOING TO LOOK INTO YOU KNOW YOUR

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:04.092
DISTRICT NUMBER CISCO UNIFIED

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:06.528
VERSUS SOMEWHERE IN MONTEREY OR

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:08.897
WHATEVER- SO THAT IT IS

01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:09.797
DIFFICULT PRESS REALLY GIVE US

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:11.733
THE GAS I THINK OUR VISION OUR

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:14.536
HOLD RIGHT IS THAT- WITH A LOT

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:17.839
WORK THAT MEANT MR FONG AND HIS

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:20.041
- STAFF TO MAKE MEMBERS BUT ARE

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:23.044
DOING AND SEE. OPERA MEDICAL

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:25.246
ASSISTANCE LIAISON- RIGHT BASIS

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:27.148
THAT BY THE END OF THIS CURRENT

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.349
YEAR AND CERTAIN IN TWENTY

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:29.183
TWENTY THREE WITH THE ADDITION

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:32.554
THE IN OF- THE L. YOU COULD GET

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.922
TO A- WHERE THEY DO HAVE

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:35.156
PROGRAMS THAT ARE UP AND

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:35.990
RUNNING- BUT OF COURSE THAT'S

01:26:36.057 --> 01:26:38.560
PREDICATED ON A LOT OF THESE

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:39.127
WRITERS THAT THERE'S THE-

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:40.261
WORKFORCE SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.230
HOPING COMES TO AN END SOON BUT

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:44.132
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW-

01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:46.267
CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD UP ON FOR

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.002
THINGS. UNFORESEEN HAPPEN WITH

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:49.203
AND TO MAKE I OUR PERSPECTIVE OF

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:50.872
THE POINT IS ASSUMING THAT THOSE

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.307
THINGS PROGRESS IN A IN A

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.976
POSITIVE DIRECTION. NONE BY THE

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.678
END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE MOST

01:26:56.744 --> 01:27:00.114
OF THE AS- BETTER CAN HELP THEY

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:01.583
NEED GUIDANCE FROM DVD WHAT HAVE

01:27:01.649 --> 01:27:03.318
YOU THAT THEY'D BE ABLE TO

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:05.486
PROGRAMS THAT ARE IF NOT 1100%

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:16.864
UP TO SPEED AT LEAST MAKING. IN

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:17.465
THAT DIRECTION SO THAT WHEN WE

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:19.601
GET THE- THREE. FOUR AS MY

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:20.201
COLLEAGUE MS GRAHAM. TO WITH

WANT WE DON'T WANT. SO WORRIED

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:32.914
ABOUT THE DISCONTENT- THAT IT

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:34.549
PRECLUDES THEM FROM. ALL IN GOOD

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:35.817
PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:40.488
WHAT WE BETTER I ANSWERED YOUR.

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:41.956

ENSURE. THAT THE MONEY'S SPENT

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:53.701
PROPERLY. SO HOW YOU. JUDGE OF

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:56.638
THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS. WE

01:27:56.704 --> 01:27:58.806
HAVE. YEAR OLD DISTRICTS ALL

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:00.108
OVER THE STATE ARE GONNA SPEND

01:28:00.174 --> 01:28:02.543
IT DIFFERENTLY- AND SO WE'LL

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.946
SEE. BUT YOUR YOUR JOB IS TO

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.514
DETERMINE THAT BUT MONEY IS

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:07.949
ACTUALLY BEING SPENT PROPERLY.

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:10.151
SO YOU DIDN'T GET ME- I WOULD

01:28:10.218 --> 01:28:13.488
ACTUALLY SAY THAT THAT. IF YOU

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:14.589
COULD LET ME. BEFORE YOU

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:18.292
INTERRUPT ME AND APPRECIATED. SO

01:28:18.359 --> 01:28:20.094
I GOT THIS QUESTION TWICE YOU

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:20.962
HAVEN'T GIVEN ME ANY KIND OF

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:23.831
BENCHMARK YOU GONNA SAY HEY.

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:24.599
IT'S JUST GOOD PANDA WHEN THE

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:26.801
AUDITS DONE IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:27.969
FOUR WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW IT IS.

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:30.638
SO HOW ARE YOU GONNA BE DOING

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:32.573
YOUR JOB IT OVER THE NEXT THREE

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.109
YEARS TO ENSURE THAT THIS MONEY.

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:37.712
IS REACHING. THE KIDS AND THE

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.514
FAMILIES WE ARE WE'RE ALL

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.949
INTENDING TO HELP WHICH IS ALL

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.951
WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT. AND I

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:45.420
DIDN'T GET GOT INTO ANY CLEAR

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:46.954
INDICATION THAT YOU HAVE ANY

01:28:47.021 --> 01:28:49.424
IDEA OF HOW THAT WAS GOING TO BE

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:50.525
HOW YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO

01:28:50.591 --> 01:28:54.028
THAT. BUT THE JOINT EFFORT.

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:57.899
RIGHT SO THE WORK THAT MR FONG.

01:28:57.965 --> 01:28:59.067
AND HIS FOLKS LIKE IF THAT DOING

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:00.334
IT EITHER DOING THEIR BEST TO

01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:02.904
GET A- FOLKS IN THE FIELD BEST

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.739
ADVICE THAT THEY CAN PERCENT OF

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:05.973
STATUTE. RIGHT ALLOWABLE THERE

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:09.644
IF. I PRESUME FROM CONVERSATION

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:10.778
. I'VE HAD WITH MISTER HAWKINS.

01:29:10.845 --> 01:29:13.781
THAT ITALIAN COME FOR THEM. AND

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:14.816
IS TALKING ABOUT USING THE FUNDS

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:16.350
IN A WAY THAT YOU KNOW WOULDN'T

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:18.219
BE ALLOWABLE WOULDN'T BE UP TO.

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:19.620
THE EXPECTATION OF THE PROGRAM

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:21.756
HERE SO WE'RE GOING TO LET THEM

01:29:21.823 --> 01:29:23.725
KNOW. RIGHT THAT THAT'S- NOT

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:25.159
SOMETHING THEY SHOULD PROBABLY

01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:26.861
BE DOING. OR THEY WILL SUFFER

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:27.762
SOME KIND OF AUDIT. AND IF

01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:29.864
YOU'RE OTHERWISE- THE WAY THAT

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:31.599
THIS PROGRAM THOUGH AND SEVERAL

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:34.235
PROGRAMS IN IN THAT CODE WORK-

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:35.703
OFTEN IS THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:38.506
IS AT THE YOU KNOW MORE OR LESS-

01:29:38.573 --> 01:29:39.974
AT THE BACK INTO THE AUDIT

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.809
PROCESS RIGHT- IN FACT YOU THERE

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.611
ISN'T NECESSARILY A WAY FOR

01:29:43.678 --> 01:29:45.613
FINANCE. TO GO IN AND- MONITOR

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.815
EVERY ELEAZAR. SPENDING FOR THIS

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:49.851
PROGRAM IN A REAL TIME BASIS

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.719
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW IT WORKS-

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:54.489
YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL-

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:58.025
ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS THAT NEED

01:29:58.092 --> 01:29:59.193
CERTAINLY NOT THE CONVERSATION I

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.495
COULD BE HAPPY. IN THE SHORT

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:02.730
TERM. BUT FOR US WE HEARD A LOT

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.632
OF WE WANT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:06.501
WHAT ELEAZAR TELLING US OVER

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:07.735
THIS WHOLE LAST YEAR. THAT THEY

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:08.703
WERE HAVING A REALLY REALLY HARD

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.171
I AM WORRIED ABOUT GETTING OVER

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:14.175
PENALIZED- WHEN EVEN WHEN THEY-WERE MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT-

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:16.444
TO OFFER THE PROGRAM. SO AND

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:18.713
FINANCES GOAL IS A TYPICALLY TO

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.914
JUST BE YOU KNOW. CHECKING IN ON

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.082
WHAT DISTRICTS ARE DOING ON THE

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.583
MONEY ON A WEEKLY OR MONTHLY

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:23.284
BASIS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:25.286
REALLY IS KIND OF MORE. HERE'S

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:26.220
THE REQUIREMENT. AND THEN WE'RE

01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:28.356
GONNA HAVE A CONVERSATION AT A

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:29.891
TIME CERTAIN CERTAIN STATUTE

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:39.867
ABOUT HOW ABOUT. HOW THAT'S

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:42.603
GOING. OKAY BROWN- MY DO THAT. I

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:43.771
LEAST IN MY MIND I DON'T I DON'T

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:45.106
WORK FOR THE L. A. ASE. I DON'T

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:46.641
THINK YOU DO EITHER. OF WORK FOR

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.409
THE FAMILY AND THE- OF THE

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:49.844
STATE. THAT'S WE'RE SETTING UP

01:30:49.911 --> 01:30:51.546
FOR. AND WHAT WE SAW. DURING THE

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:53.614
LAST TWO YEARS IS THAT THERE

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.750
SEEM TO BE A DISCONNECT. BETWEEN

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:58.886
L. A. A.'S. IN THOSE FAMILIES

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:00.721
AND THOSE KIDS. AND THEN A TIME

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:01.856
WHEN WE HAD A PANDEMIC AT A TIME

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:03.958
WHEN MOST LEDS REFUSED TO OPEN

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:07.161
THEIR SCHOOLS. WHEN THE PUBLIC

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:09.096
HEALTH DOCTORS ALL SAID IT WAS

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:12.433
SAFE TO DO SO- ELEAZAR.

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:16.003
CONFIGURED TO DO. SO I WOULD.

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.971
YOU KNOW JUST REMIND THE

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:20.007
DEPARTMENT THAT. YOU DON'T WORK

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:22.009
FOR THE A. S. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:24.111
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS IT I DON'T

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:25.313
AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND I

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:27.014
TOTALLY RESPECT HIS JUDGMENT

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:30.318
COMPLETED MISTER FOCUS SOUNDS

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.118
LIKE YOUR DEFERRING. TO FUNG'S

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:33.054
JUDGE AS TO WHETHER THE MONEY'S

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.690
BEING SPENT APPROPRIATE OR NOT.

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:39.861
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD. ARE YOU

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:41.829
SAYING THAT IT'S A JOINT EFFORT

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:43.464
MR FONG HAS A ROLE FINANCE OF

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:45.600
THE ROLE IN THE AUDIT GUIDE

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:47.668
PROCESS AS I MENTIONED HOW THE

01:31:47.735 --> 01:31:49.036
ROLE IN TERMS OF THE

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:51.939
ACCOUNTABILITY OFF PROGRAM. ONE

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:53.941
CRITICAL TO ME WHAT MR FUNK'S

01:31:54.008 --> 01:31:55.243
ROLLINS WITH A LOT OF ROLE AS I

01:31:55.309 --> 01:31:57.979
SEE DON'T. THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE

01:31:58.045 --> 01:31:59.213
. WELL I WOULD SAY DEPARTMENT OF

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:03.317
FINANCE. CERTAINLY THE- THE-

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:07.021
COMPLIANCE AGENCY- BRITAIN'S OF

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:08.789
THE STATUE FOR THIS PROGRAM.

01:32:08.856 --> 01:32:10.057
RIGHT CERTAINLY HAVE A HAND IN

01:32:10.124 --> 01:32:11.859
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:13.828
PROGRAM RIGHT IT'S OUR PROPOSAL

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:15.596
TO ADD THE NEW DOLLARS BUT

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:16.664
TYPICALLY FOR A PROGRAM LIKE

01:32:16.731 --> 01:32:18.399
THIS. IT REALLY DOES FALL MORE

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:19.667
WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE CD

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.569
ALCOHOLIC I PROCESS THAT'S JUST

01:32:21.636 --> 01:32:23.337
KIND OF HOW A LOT OF EDUCATION

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:25.740
PROGRAMS. WORK IN LESS IF

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.308
FINANCES IT WOULD BE WRITTEN

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.850
OPPORTUNITY TO PARADE FUNDING

COMMUNITIES- LOOK AT IT AS ONE

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:34.929

01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:37.598
SEPARATES AND SILO TO PROGRAMS

POINT THAT I HEAR A LOT THAT. IT

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:47.808
AFTER SCHOOL IS A COMPONENT IT'S

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.310
AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF A

01:35:49.376 --> 01:35:51.212
CHILD'S EDUCATION. WE'RE NOT

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:52.580

MORE OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY THAT- OF

01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:18.912
THIS THE WAGES THAT WERE PAYING-

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:20.547
MOST OF THESE EMPLOYEES THEY'RE

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:23.283
NOT SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM- LIES

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:25.052
YOU MENTIONED THIS DIFFICULTY

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:27.554
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SEE-

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:30.290
A CAREER TRAJECTORY IN THESE IN

01:40:30.357 --> 01:40:32.893
THESE FIELDS RATHER THAN. JUST

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.294
AS A JOB TO YOU KNOW GO JUMP

01:40:34.361 --> 01:40:36.764
INTO ANOTHER FIELD- IT'S I THINK

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:37.598
THAT DEFINITELY IS THE RIGHT

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:39.767
STRATEGY AND OBVIOUSLY I FULLY

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:42.603
SUPPORT- LOOKING AT WAYS TO

01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:44.004
INCREASE COMPETITION I THINK

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:45.506
THAT'S QUITE. OFTEN THE CHAIR

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:47.007
HAVE FOUGHT FOR YEARS TO

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:48.675
INCREASE RATES- BECAUSE WE KNEW

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:51.078
THAT FOR SO LONG PEOPLE WERE

01:40:51.145 --> 01:40:53.013
JUST UNDERPAID AND IT'S JUST NOT

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.982
SUSTAINABLE TO KIND OF TURN YOU

01:40:55.048 --> 01:40:56.884
HAVE THE TURN OVER YOU HAVE-

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:58.986
WITH A FEW PEOPLE. OBVIOUSLY

01:40:59.052 --> 01:41:00.421
PEOPLE LIKE BABYSITTERS AFTER

01:41:00.487 --> 01:41:01.555
TOGETHER YOU CAN BET YOU GET

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:03.023
BABYSITTERS BUT IF YOU IF YOU

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:06.427
WANT TO ACCESS YOU ACTUALLY WANT

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:07.928
TO- HAVE. EDUCATORS YOUNG PEOPLE

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:10.063
EDUCATE TO CAN'T PAY PEOPLE LIKE

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:13.133
. MINIMUM WAGE SALARIES AND

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.535
EXPECT THEM TO BE EDUCATORS

01:41:14.601 --> 01:41:16.637
THAT'S NOT. A FAIR- IS NOT A

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:18.705
FAIR PROPOSAL IT IS NOT FAIR

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:22.609
EXPECTATIONS SO TOTALLY. I

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:23.410
TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THERE IS

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:25.579
SO SOUNDS LIKE ONE ONE POTENTIAL

01:41:25.646 --> 01:41:29.750
THAT YOU SEE IS- PERHAPS- YOU

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:30.951

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:01.281
AROUND LEARNING LOSS AS WELL AS

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:04.885
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- OBVIOUSLY.

IN THEIR PROGRAMS FOR THOSE

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:25.839
ISSUES. YEAH AND THAT'S AN

01:42:25.906 --> 01:42:28.408
EXCELLENT QUESTION I THINK THAT-

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:30.644
WHAT WE FOUND WITH OUR PROGRAMS

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:31.745
WERE REPORTING WITH THE

01:42:31.812 --> 01:42:33.514
INCREASED FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:37.384
RECEIVED- EARLY LAST YEAR. ME

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:39.219
THEY FELT VERY FORTUNATE THAT

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:40.654
THEY WERE ABLE TO USE THOSE

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:43.423
FUNDING THAT THE EXISTING ASUS

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:44.591
IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FUNDING

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:46.460
DURING THE DAY TO ALLOW THEIR

01:42:46.527 --> 01:42:48.228
AFTER SCHOOL STAFF TO ACTUALLY

01:42:48.295 --> 01:42:50.063
WORK DURING THE DAY TO SUPPORT

01:42:50.130 --> 01:42:51.632
OUR YOUTH AND FAMILIES WE SOUGHT

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:53.800
THE FUNDING BEING USED THAT WAY.

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:55.602
AND HAVING QUITE DRAMATIC-

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:59.339
POSITIVE RESULTS MATTER OF FACT-

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:01.475
KIDS YOU WERE NOT NECESSARILY

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:02.643
SHOWING UP FOR THEIR DISTANCE

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:05.045
LEARNING CLASSES- BLUES AFTER

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.680
SCHOOL PROGRAM STAFF WOULD PLAY

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.415
THAT ROLE OF CALLING HOME AND

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:09.449
FINDING OUT WHERE THAT CHILD

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:12.786
WAS- I WOULD SAY- FROM MY

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.321
EXPERIENCE ALSO WORKING IN THE

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:16.256
FIELD. WE ARE VERY LUCKY AS

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:18.091
AFTER SCHOOL WORKERS TO HAVE

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:19.493
DEVELOPED VERY DEEP

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.894
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR STUDENTS

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:22.796
AND FAMILIES AND I THINK THAT'S

01:43:22.863 --> 01:43:24.598
PARTLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT.

01:43:24.665 --> 01:43:26.900
THAT OUR PARENTS COME TO PICK UP

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:28.068
THEIR CHILDREN THERE'S AN

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.703
OPPORTUNITY TO CONVERSE THERE'S

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:31.471
AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THOSE

01:43:31.538 --> 01:43:33.707
RELATIONSHIPS AFTER SCHOOL IN A

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:36.343
WAY THAT- YOU KNOW NOT OFTEN AS

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:38.779
POSSIBLE IN THE CLASSROOM- AND

01:43:38.845 --> 01:43:40.681
SO DOES AFTER SCHOOL WORKERS

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:42.249
PLAYED SUCH A VITAL ROLE IN

01:43:42.316 --> 01:43:43.717
MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS

01:43:43.784 --> 01:43:45.686
WERE RE ENGAGING IN SCHOOL

01:43:45.752 --> 01:43:47.754
DURING THAT. REALLY AT A TIME OF

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:51.024
GREAT DROP OFF. AND I THINK ALSO

01:43:51.091 --> 01:43:53.927
HELPING TO BUILD THE SKILLS- YOU

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:55.629
KNOW I SORT OF WALKED AWAY FROM

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:56.997
THE TERM LEARNING RECOVERY

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:58.865
BECAUSE I THINK WE LEARNED SO.

01:43:58.932 --> 01:44:02.669
SO MANY NEW SKILLS AND EVEN MY

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:06.607
OWN DAUGHTER ANNE AND SONS.

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:08.375
LEARNING HOW TO. IT INTERFACE A

01:44:08.442 --> 01:44:10.944
THE IT DID. SPACE WAS A NEW

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:12.980
SKILL THAT THEY ALL LEARNED AND

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:14.881
SO WAIT HERE I AM MAYBE WORKING

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:16.717
AT HOME AND HAVE MY TEN YEAR OLD

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.251
SAY YOU KNOW I'M NOT.

01:44:18.318 --> 01:44:20.253
INTERCONNECT MY CONNECTIVITY IS

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.522
DOWN AND THEN HAVING- HER FIGURE

01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:25.592
IT OUT ON HER OWN- WE SAW A LOT

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:27.728
OF THESE SKILLS AND A LOT OF-

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:30.364
AND A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES AND

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.999
OUR STUDENTS TO. DALY BECAME

01:44:32.065 --> 01:44:33.667
VERY SELF RELIANT DURING THE

01:44:33.734 --> 01:44:36.003
PANDEMIC AND SO. I SAY ALL THAT

01:44:36.069 --> 01:44:38.338
BECAUSE I THINK. WE REALLY ALSO

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:39.439
NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE

01:44:39.506 --> 01:44:40.841
LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC AND

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:42.809
NOT BE PULLED BACK INTO WHAT WE

01:44:42.876 --> 01:44:45.212
ARE DEFINING AS NORMAL- AND IN

01:44:45.278 --> 01:44:46.513
PERSON IN FACT I'VE HAD SOME

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.148
DISTRICTS ASKED ME. IS IT

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:49.950
POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO ANYTHING

01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:52.052
ONLINE. IS WE'VE ACTUALLY HAVE

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:54.655
SOME KIDS WHO EXCELLED- DURING

01:44:54.721 --> 01:44:57.057
ONLINE AND- YEAH OF COURSE IT

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:57.958
HAD TO ANSWERING STATE.

01:44:58.025 --> 01:45:01.228
UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT NO-

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:03.196
BUT BECAUSE WE'RE ENCOURAGING IN

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:04.431
PERSON AND WE KNOW COURSE KNOW

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:06.333
THE VALUE OF THAT. BUT THERE ARE

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:09.369
ALSO SOME STUDENTS WHO WHO

01:45:09.436 --> 01:45:11.571
QUITE. LITERALLY BENEFIT FROM A

01:45:11.638 --> 01:45:13.740
NOT AN OPPORTUNITY- AND AGAIN

01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:16.309
YOU KNOW. THE MARLBOROUGH WINES

01:45:16.376 --> 01:45:18.078
AND THAT MAY BE A RESOURCE THAT

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:21.615
THEY NEED TO TAP INTO. AT SOME

01:45:21.682 --> 01:45:22.949
POINT TO MAKE IT WORK. SO GREAT

01:45:23.016 --> 01:45:27.387

MAGIC HAPPENS IN TRANSFORMATION

01:47:25.038 --> 01:47:26.940
. WHEN THE SCHOOL IS NOT

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:30.477

REQUIREMENT IN STASHING. IN

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:03.076
EVERY CASE IS A TWENTY FIRST

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:06.847
CENTURY PROGRAM. SELECT WORK

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:10.717
WITH THE QUALITY STANDARDS AND.

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:11.852
DEVELOP CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:15.689
AWESOMEST SO THE HEAT THE YOUTH

01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:17.824
AND STUDENTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:21.294
ARE EXPERIENCING. SOMETHING VERY

01:48:21.361 --> 01:48:25.565
TRANSFORMATIVE AND IN RICHMOND-

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:28.802
AND THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT MAR

01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:30.704
MENTIONED WHERE OUR COMMUNITY

01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:34.374
EDUCATORS HAVE CLOSE PROXIMITY

01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:35.942
TO THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES SO

01:48:36.009 --> 01:48:37.911
THE QUALITY STANDARDS FOR EXPAND

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:40.113
LEARNING. WE'RE ALSO BUILT INTO

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.682
THE PROGRAM PLAN. THAT IS

01:48:42.749 --> 01:48:44.417

01:48:44.484 --> 01:48:45.585
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM

01:48:45.652 --> 01:48:47.654
SO THERE'S A LINE THAT THERE.

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:49.890
AND I WOULD I WOULD SAY WITH

01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:53.960
CONFIDENCE. THAT YES QUALITY

01:48:54.027 --> 01:48:54.494
VARIES ACROSS AFTER SCHOOL

STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN THE

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:09.910
DEEPEST URBAN AREAS. AND I SEE.

01:49:09.976 --> 01:49:11.211
HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:15.315
CONSISTENTLY WHERE CHILDREN ARE

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:18.184
ENGAGED THERE. EXPANDING THEIR

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:20.954

AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

01:49:26.593 --> 01:49:27.794
- WHAT I WOULD SAYFIRST AND

01:49:27.861 --> 01:49:28.795
FOREMOST IS THAT THE

01:49:28.862 --> 01:49:31.197
RELATIONSHIPS THAT AFTER SCHOOL

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:33.133
STAFF HAVE WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:36.169
OUR DEEP AND CARING AND THAT IS

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:37.370
ONE OF THE STRONGEST PROTECTIVE

01:49:37.437 --> 01:49:39.673
FACTORS AGAINST MENTAL HEALTH

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:41.841
AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES.

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:43.810
IS WHEN STUDENTS FEEL ISOLATED

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:45.512
AND OUT OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH

01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:53.119
STUDENTS. THAT IS THE MOST THE

01:49:53.186 --> 01:49:54.888
STRONGEST PROTECTIVE FACTOR

01:49:54.955 --> 01:49:56.423
AGAINST MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL

01:49:56.489 --> 01:50:00.093
EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES. SO MR TANG

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.929

PARENTS CAN RELY ON THIS AS NOT

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:23.950
ONLY A PLACE WHERE THEIR CHILD

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:25.919

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:28.388
THEIR CHILD CAN EXPERIENCE.

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:29.456

OF THE LAST COMMENT YOU MADE I

01:56:12.398 --> 01:56:13.032
THINK IS PROBABLY THE ONE OF THE

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:14.600
MOST IMPORTANT IS THE LIVABLE

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:16.703
WAGES FOR OUR WORKERS WERE

01:56:16.769 --> 01:56:19.305
EXPECTING THEM TO DO SOMETHING

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:21.474
THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND THAT IS

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:23.242
TEACHING OUR CHILDREN WORKING

01:56:23.309 --> 01:56:25.511
WITH OUR CHILDREN- HELPING WITH

01:56:25.578 --> 01:56:28.047
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND IF WE

01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:33.186
DON'T PAY EVERYBODY EVERYBODY

BUT IF WE DON'T PROVIDE. LIVABLE

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:39.625
WAGES AND BENEFITS WE WON'T HAVE

01:56:39.692 --> 01:56:41.761
THE STABILITY THAT WE NEED FOR

FEEL THAT THIS I SOMETHING THAT

01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:51.971
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I THINK

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:53.606
MAKING SURE THAT THEY THE

01:56:53.673 --> 01:56:55.274
PROGRAMS ARE NOT BABY SITTING

01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:56.776
AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM

01:56:56.843 --> 01:56:58.578
WE'VE SEEN QUALITY PROGRAMS IN

01:56:58.644 --> 01:57:01.080

HELP WITH HOMEWORK THESE ARE THE

01:57:16.896 --> 01:57:18.731
SORTS OF THINGS THAT PROVIDE

01:57:18.798 --> 01:57:21.501
THAT EXTENSION- THE MENTAL

01:57:21.567 --> 01:57:26.205

EXPERT EXPANDED LEARNING

01:57:34.814 --> 01:57:37.049
OPPORTUNITY BUT- IT'S AN

01:57:37.116 --> 01:57:38.751
EXTENSION OF THE SCHOOL. THE

01:57:38.818 --> 01:57:41.554
SCHOOL DAY SO THAT THE CHILDREN

01:57:41.621 --> 01:57:44.557
THEN HAVE MORE PROVIDED TO THEM

01:57:44.624 --> 01:57:46.926
DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME. AND

01:57:46.993 --> 01:57:48.795
THAT IT IT'S INVALUABLE EVERY

01:57:48.861 --> 01:57:51.464
PROGRAM THAT I HAVE SEEN HAS IT

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:53.332
IN MY OPINION HAS PROVEN TO BE A

01:57:53.399 --> 01:57:56.903
VERY- SUCCESSFUL ON THE EVE OF

01:57:56.969 --> 01:57:59.172
SUBSTANCE PROVED TO BE VERY

01:57:59.238 --> 01:58:01.841
SUCCESSFUL. THE LAST THING THAT

01:58:01.908 --> 01:58:04.677
IS. AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:28.034
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO HAVE THE

01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:30.236
ACCOUNTABILITY SO IF WE DO HAVE

01:58:30.303 --> 01:58:31.504

ME TO THE SCHOOLS BUT WE ALSO

01:58:41.481 --> 01:58:42.515
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT SOME

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:45.117
SCHOOLS REQUIRE MORE ASSISTANCE.

01:58:45.184 --> 01:58:46.385
THEY MAY NOT BE AS CREATIVE

BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THEY'RE

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:49.655
NOT ABLE TO PAY THE PEOPLE TO

YEAR REQUIRING THAT BEGINNING IN

02:03:48.053 --> 02:03:49.388
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ALL

02:03:49.455 --> 02:03:50.389
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS PROVIDE ONE-

FREE BREAKFAST AND ONE FREE

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.926
LUNCH PER SCHOOL DAY TO ANY

02:03:53.993 --> 02:03:55.461
STUDENT REQUESTING A MEAL UNDER

02:03:55.528 --> 02:03:57.329
UNIVERSAL MEALS. THE REMAINDER

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:58.864
OF MY COMMENTS FOCUS ON THE

02:03:58.931 --> 02:04:00.499
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FIND

02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:00.900
ADDITIONAL KITCHEN

02:04:00.966 --> 02:04:02.001
INFRASTRUCTURE IN TRAINING

02:04:02.067 --> 02:04:03.869
GRANTS WE RECOMMEND TO THE

02:04:03.936 --> 02:04:05.638
LEGISLATURE APPROVED A REDUCED

02:04:05.704 --> 02:04:07.306
AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:04:07.373 --> 02:04:09.141
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE GRANTS

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:10.376
THIS IS ONE THIRD OF THE

02:04:10.442 --> 02:04:11.644
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AMOUNT BUT

02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:13.546
IT MATCHES THE AMOUNT PROVIDED

02:04:13.612 --> 02:04:15.080
IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE

02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:16.182
PRIMARY REASON WE'RE

02:04:16.248 --> 02:04:17.716
RECOMMENDING APPROVING A REDUCED

02:04:17.783 --> 02:04:19.385
AMOUNT IS BECAUSE THE STATE DOES

02:04:19.451 --> 02:04:21.554
NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A CLEAR SENSE

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:22.955
OF THE TOTAL COST OF KITCHEN

02:04:23.022 --> 02:04:24.056
INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:25.491
ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:27.159
UNIVERSAL MEALS AT THIS TIME

02:04:27.226 --> 02:04:28.060
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STATE

02:04:28.127 --> 02:04:29.395
ALREADY PROVIDED FUNDING FOR

02:04:29.461 --> 02:04:31.430
THESE ACTIVITIES AND THE TWENTY

02:04:31.497 --> 02:04:32.364
ONE TWENTY TWO PROJECT. WE DO

02:04:32.431 --> 02:04:33.933
EXPECT SOME MORE INFORMATION TO

02:04:33.999 --> 02:04:35.401
BE MADE AVAILABLE AFTER JUNE

02:04:35.467 --> 02:04:37.636
THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE

02:04:37.703 --> 02:04:38.938
WHICH IS WHEN ELOISE MUST REPORT

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:40.806
HOW THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:43.209
WAS USED WE ALSO RECOMMEND

02:04:43.275 --> 02:04:44.577
PRIORITIZING THIS FUNDING FOR

02:04:44.643 --> 02:04:46.679
IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL MEALS

02:04:46.745 --> 02:04:48.380
RATHER THAN THE CORPORATION OF

02:04:48.447 --> 02:04:49.548
FRESH FOODS THEIR SCRATCH

02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:51.817
COOKING SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO

02:04:51.884 --> 02:04:53.552
MANAGE A VARIETY OF CHALLENGES

02:04:53.619 --> 02:04:55.187
IN THE NEAR TERM INCLUDING

02:04:55.254 --> 02:04:56.755
IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL MEALS

02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:59.191
STAFFING SHORTAGES AND INCREASED

02:04:59.258 --> 02:05:01.393
FOOD AND EQUIPMENT COSTS. FOR

02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:02.695
THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE

02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:04.730
EDUCATIONAL FUNDING FOR SCRATCH

02:05:04.797 --> 02:05:05.998
COOKING TO MEET SOMEONE M.

02:05:06.065 --> 02:05:08.400
PREMATURE AT THIS TIME WE THINK

02:05:08.467 --> 02:05:09.735
THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT

02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:15.941
FUNDING FOR BOTH UNIVERSAL MEALS. AND SCRATCH COOKING IN FUTURE

02:05:16.008 --> 02:05:17.243
YEARS ONCE MORE IT. ABOUT DEMAND

02:05:17.309 --> 02:05:19.545
AND THE USE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY

02:05:19.612 --> 02:05:20.412
TWO GRANTS AND- LASTLY THE LEAD

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:22.448
. COULD ALSO CONSIDER MODIFYING

02:05:22.514 --> 02:05:23.883
THE PROPOSAL FOR THE GRANTS TO

02:05:23.949 --> 02:05:25.050
TARGET DISTRICTS THAT ARE MOST

02:05:25.117 --> 02:05:27.553
IMPACTED BY UNIVERSAL MEALS. THE

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:29.054
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALLOCATES A

02:05:29.121 --> 02:05:30.789
PORTION OF FUNDING TO DISTRICTS

02:05:30.856 --> 02:05:32.725
WITH AT LEAST 30% OF STUDENTS

02:05:32.791 --> 02:05:34.426
QUALIFYING FOR FREE OR REDUCED

02:05:34.493 --> 02:05:36.128
PRICE MEALS. THIS APPROACH

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:37.930
LIKELY EXCLUDES DISTRICTS THAT

02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:39.765
NEED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:41.233
THEIR CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:43.235
UNIVERSAL MEALS INCLUDING THOSE

02:05:43.302 --> 02:05:44.570
NOT CURRENTLY OFFERING SCHOOL

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:46.538
LUNCH OR BREAKFAST. AND THOSE

02:05:46.605 --> 02:05:48.107
WITH LOWER SHARES OF STUDENTS

02:05:48.173 --> 02:05:49.708
ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED

02:05:49.775 --> 02:05:51.510
PRICE MEALS. ENSURE SMOOTHER

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:52.511
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

02:05:52.578 --> 02:05:54.313
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:56.682
ALLOCATING FUNDING BASED ON SOME

02:05:56.749 --> 02:05:58.884
MEASURE OF NEEDED CAPACITY SUCH

02:05:58.951 --> 02:06:00.452
AS SOME PROJECTION OF HOW MANY

02:06:00.519 --> 02:06:02.121
MORE BILLS A DISTRICT WE NEED TO

02:06:02.187 --> 02:06:03.789
SERVE. UNDER UNIVERSAL MEALS

02:06:03.856 --> 02:06:05.457
COMPARED TO A PRIOR BASELINE

02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:06.926
LEVEL. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY

02:06:06.992 --> 02:06:08.294
TESTIMONY BUT HAPPY ANSWER ANY

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.561

INVESTMENT TRULY ELEVATES THE

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:42.294
IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY SCHOOL

02:06:42.361 --> 02:06:44.630

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:55.274
FINANCIAL RESPITE TO MAKE IT

02:06:55.341 --> 02:06:57.343
HAPPEN. STEADY'S CONFIRM THAT

02:06:57.409 --> 02:06:59.111
THERE IS INCREASED PARTICIPATION

02:06:59.178 --> 02:07:01.847
SCHOOL MALES FROM ALL STUDENTS

02:07:01.914 --> 02:07:03.382
REGARDLESS OF THEIR ECONOMIC

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:11.023
HAS REVEALED JUST HOW TRULY

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:13.392
ESSENTIAL SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS

02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:15.928

OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET AND THE

INVESTMENTS AND UNIVERSAL MALES.

02:07:35.214 --> 02:07:37.116
THIS BUDGET REALLY HELPS THAT

02:07:37.182 --> 02:07:38.617
OUR SCHOOLS UP FOR GREATER

02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:40.219

SUSTAINABLE UNIVERSAL MALES

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:44.256
PROGRAM. THE DESIGN OF THE

02:07:44.323 --> 02:07:46.058
UNIVERSAL MALES PROGRAM IS

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:48.427
INTENTIONAL TO SUPPLEMENT NOT

02:07:48.494 --> 02:07:49.895
SUPPLANT THE FEDERAL MAIL

02:07:49.962 --> 02:07:52.564

MAXIMIZE THE FULL AMOUNT OF

02:08:03.242 --> 02:08:05.611
FEDERAL FUNDING BY REQUIRING

02:08:05.677 --> 02:08:07.479
HIGH PRIVATE POVERTY SCHOOLS TO

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:12.284
IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY. OR PROVISION AND THE NEXT

02:08:12.351 --> 02:08:13.152
SCHOOL YEAR. CURRENTLY THERE'S

02:08:13.218 --> 02:08:15.421
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SIX ELEAZAR

02:08:15.487 --> 02:08:18.457

COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION

02:08:22.094 --> 02:08:24.596

02:08:24.663 --> 02:08:26.198
OVER A LEVIN HUNDRED SCHOOL

02:08:26.265 --> 02:08:28.100

COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY. THERE

02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:38.610
WOULD BE A COST SAVINGS TO THE

02:08:38.677 --> 02:08:40.646
STATE UNIVERSAL MALES PROGRAM

02:08:40.712 --> 02:08:42.247
BECAUSE WE WOULD BE TOP DRAWING

02:08:42.314 --> 02:08:45.017
DOWN MORE FEDERAL FUNDS AT THE

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:47.419
FREE RATE. THE PROPOSED FOUR

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:57.563
RECOGNIZES THAT NOT ALL SCHOOLS

02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:59.498

NEED CHOICE AND OPTIONS AND HOW

02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:15.681
TO USE THESE VALUABLE RESOURCES.

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:17.216
THE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS ALLOW

02:09:17.282 --> 02:09:19.017
SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT OR EXPAND

02:09:19.084 --> 02:09:21.320

COUPON WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE

02:19:00.832 --> 02:19:01.332
I'LL START WITH THE SCHOOL

02:19:01.399 --> 02:19:03.535
TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL. IN JUST

02:19:03.601 --> 02:19:04.469
SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND HERE

02:19:04.536 --> 02:19:06.404
SCHOOL DISTRICTS OWN NEARLY

02:19:06.471 --> 02:19:07.405
SIXTEEN THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSES

02:19:07.472 --> 02:19:08.940
ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THOSE ARE

02:19:09.007 --> 02:19:10.175
DIESEL BUSES AND MANY OF THOSE

02:19:10.241 --> 02:19:11.776
DIESEL BUSES ARE OLDER MODELS

02:19:11.843 --> 02:19:12.844
THAT WERE MANUFACTURED UNDER

02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:14.779
LESS STRINGENT EMISSION

02:19:14.846 --> 02:19:15.346
STANDARDS IN THOSE EXISTING

02:19:15.413 --> 02:19:17.615
TODAY. A BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:18.750
ARE RELATIVELY NEW MY CHIN

02:19:18.817 --> 02:19:19.784
DISTRICTS BEGAN BUYING THEM

02:19:19.851 --> 02:19:20.885
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND

02:19:20.952 --> 02:19:22.120
CURRENTLY OWNS SEVERAL HUNDRED

02:19:22.187 --> 02:19:24.856
STATEWIDE. ELECTED BUSES HOUSE

02:19:24.923 --> 02:19:26.124
MENTAL ADVANTAGES DID NOT

02:19:26.191 --> 02:19:27.425
PRODUCE DETAILED EMISSIONS THAT

02:19:27.492 --> 02:19:29.394
CAN HARM HUMAN HEALTH. THEY

02:19:29.461 --> 02:19:31.029
MIGHT SNIFFING LESS GREENHOUSE

02:19:31.096 --> 02:19:32.797
GAS AND IT CAN BE LESS EXPENSIVE

02:19:32.864 --> 02:19:34.933
TO OPERATE. THE MAIN IMITATION

02:19:34.999 --> 02:19:36.334
IS THE RANGE MANY MODELS TODAY

02:19:36.401 --> 02:19:37.702
HAVE A MAXIMUM RANGES BETWEEN A

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:38.703
HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND A HUNDRED

02:19:38.770 --> 02:19:40.371
FIFTY MILES. AND THAT MEANS

02:19:40.438 --> 02:19:41.439
NOTHING BE LESSEN STRENUOUS

02:19:41.506 --> 02:19:42.707
CONDITIONS LIKE MOUNTAINOUS

02:19:42.774 --> 02:19:44.676
TERRAIN OR HOT OR COLD WEATHER.

02:19:44.743 --> 02:19:45.276
THEY ALSO THE HIGHER UPFRONT

02:19:45.343 --> 02:19:47.145
COST ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AS A

02:19:47.212 --> 02:19:48.413
DIESEL BUS. I THINK THE

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:49.781
ADMINISTRATION GIVE YOU A GOOD

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:50.982
OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL SO IT

02:19:51.049 --> 02:19:53.284
IS ON TOP OF A LARGE FEDERAL

02:19:53.351 --> 02:19:54.486
PROGRAM CREATED LAST NOVEMBER.

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:55.520
THE FUND AND FIFTY MILLION

02:19:55.587 --> 02:19:57.388
DOLLARS STATE PROGRAM CREATED IN

02:19:57.455 --> 02:19:58.490
THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

02:19:58.556 --> 02:19:59.924
BUDGET. COUPLE SMALLER STATE

02:19:59.991 --> 02:20:01.393
PROGRAMS. AND WE THINK THE

02:20:01.459 --> 02:20:02.694
ADMINISTRATION'S ADVANCED A

02:20:02.761 --> 02:20:04.462
PROMISING IDEA USING ONE TIME

02:20:04.529 --> 02:20:06.464
FUNDS TO PURCHASE ELECTRIC BUSES

02:20:06.531 --> 02:20:07.699
COULD PROVIDE MISSION BENEFITS

02:20:07.766 --> 02:20:09.234
THAT WILL LAST FOR MANY YEARS.

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:10.301
AND AGAIN DISTRICTS SOME COST

02:20:10.368 --> 02:20:11.970
RELIEF RELATED REPLACING OLDER

02:20:12.036 --> 02:20:13.972
BUSES AND PROGESTIN. WOULD

02:20:14.038 --> 02:20:14.973
RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE PROPOSAL

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:17.208
WITH A COUPLE MODIFICATIONS. ARE

02:20:17.275 --> 02:20:18.910
THE FIRST TO BE TO PRIORITIZE

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:20.278
THE PLACEMENT OF THE OLDEST

02:20:20.345 --> 02:20:22.480
BUSES I SWEAR AS THE GOVERNOR

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:23.515
PROPOSES THE AGE OF THE BUSES AS

02:20:23.581 --> 02:20:24.916
ONE FACTOR WE RECOMMEND MAKING

02:20:24.983 --> 02:20:26.518
IT THE MAIN FACTOR. GENERALLY

02:20:26.584 --> 02:20:28.353
OLDER BUSES EMIT MORE POLLUTION

02:20:28.419 --> 02:20:29.621
SO PLACED IN THE OLDEST ONES

02:20:29.687 --> 02:20:30.655
FIRST WOULD MAXIMIZE THE

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:31.589
POTENTIAL AIR QUALITY

02:20:31.656 --> 02:20:33.625
IMPROVEMENTS. A SECOND WE

02:20:33.691 --> 02:20:34.759
RECOMMEND ALLOWING FUNDING FOR

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:36.694
OTHER TYPES OF BUSES ELECTRIC

02:20:36.761 --> 02:20:38.196
BUSES ARE NOT FEASIBLE. THIS IS

02:20:38.263 --> 02:20:39.631
MAINLY AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:41.566
REAL DISTRICTS OF LONG STRENUOUS

02:20:41.633 --> 02:20:42.567
ROUTE. IN THOSE DISTRICTS

02:20:42.634 --> 02:20:44.302
REPLACEMENT THEY'RE NOT ELECTED

02:20:44.369 --> 02:20:46.304
BUS WITH THE NEW. BUSQUETS

02:20:46.371 --> 02:20:48.740
ACHIEVE. REDUCTIONS IN POLLUTION

02:20:48.807 --> 02:20:49.674
. I WE'VE GOT ELIMINATING THE

02:20:49.741 --> 02:20:51.309
TEMPERATE ALLOWANCE FOR OTHER

02:20:51.376 --> 02:20:53.378
TRANSPORTATION COSTS. ARE THAT

02:20:53.444 --> 02:21:02.387
PART OF THE PROPOSAL DOES. NOT

02:21:02.453 --> 02:21:03.621
SEEM CLEARLY CONNECTED WITH THE

02:21:03.688 --> 02:21:04.189
UNDERLYING BECAUSE IS PRETTY

02:21:04.255 --> 02:21:05.323
SIMILAR. BUS FOR RUNNING A

02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:06.291
SCHOOL TRUST. PROGRAM AND WE

02:21:06.357 --> 02:21:07.358
HAVE SOME KIND THAT IT CA

02:21:07.425 --> 02:21:09.093
DISCOURAGE DISTRICTS. FOR PLACE

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:09.994
FUNDING FROM THE OTHER PROGRAMS

02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:13.231
THAT DON'T OFFER THAT. OF A LOT

02:21:13.298 --> 02:21:14.432
. NOT WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:16.534
STARTING WITH A SMALL AND MARK

02:21:16.601 --> 02:21:18.403
LEE FOR THE FOR. AND FUTURE FUND

02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:20.004
OVER SO YEARS. THAT WOULD

02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:21.406
PROVIDE THE LATEST NOT BUT TO A

02:21:21.472 --> 02:21:22.907
- THE- IN THE FUTURE BASED

02:21:22.974 --> 02:21:24.776
DISTRICT IN. IN PROGRESS FOR TO

02:21:24.843 --> 02:21:26.978
PLAY SOME THE BUSES. ONE OUT

02:21:27.045 --> 02:21:28.613
COULD BE TO WITH THE NEW ON OF

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:30.315
FIVE MILLION. AND AFTER PLACE

02:21:30.381 --> 02:21:32.150
THAN I THOUGHT BUSES. LYNCH AND

02:21:32.217 --> 02:21:33.184
FIX UP THE CURRENT IN A TWO

02:21:33.251 --> 02:21:35.887
YEARS. IF YOU JUST WITH

02:21:35.954 --> 02:21:37.455
SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE FULL FIVE

02:21:37.522 --> 02:21:39.157
FIVE BILLION. WOULD RECOMMEND

02:21:39.224 --> 02:21:40.558
ALLOWING SOME OF IT TO BE TRICKS

02:21:40.625 --> 02:21:44.062
DISTRICT. NOT A PLACE BY. THAT

02:21:44.128 --> 02:21:46.764
WOULD SAFETY CARE THE FULHAM

02:21:46.831 --> 02:21:52.370
INTEREST DESTROY. LASTLY WE SEE

02:21:52.437 --> 02:21:54.272
. CAN WHICH AGENCY IS BEST

02:21:54.339 --> 02:21:56.307
POSITIONED TO. THE WE CAN PUT A

02:21:56.374 --> 02:21:57.976
CREDIT. IS KEEPING OF MAN THE

02:21:58.042 --> 02:22:00.011
PROBE. THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF

02:22:00.078 --> 02:22:01.079

COULD LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND

02:22:10.889 --> 02:22:12.223
DIVIDING TO FROM ACROSS THE TWO

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:14.092

CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT REALLY A

02:29:41.439 --> 02:29:43.741
REASONABLE APPROACH THOSE

02:29:43.808 --> 02:29:44.508
DOLLARS SHOULD BE SPENT IN THE

02:29:44.575 --> 02:29:46.310

02:29:53.117 --> 02:29:54.618
LECTURED. FOR A VARIETY OF

02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:56.654

02:29:56.721 --> 02:29:58.923
GOOD IDEA NINE NINE NINE NINETY

02:29:58.989 --> 02:30:00.458
EIGHT LET'S HAVE THAT

02:30:00.524 --> 02:30:01.625
CONVERSATION BUT USING CLASSROOM

02:30:01.692 --> 02:30:03.828
DOLLARS FOR THAT PURPOSE. AGAIN

02:30:03.894 --> 02:30:05.296
IS TO ME JUST CHASING THE SHINY

02:30:05.363 --> 02:30:08.466
OBJECT A SHINY OBJECT TO ME. IS

02:30:08.532 --> 02:30:09.867
THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS OF OUR

02:30:09.934 --> 02:30:12.470
STUDENTS I WITH THAT AND JUST

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:14.772
OVER TO THE FACILITY SIDE- THAT

02:30:14.839 --> 02:30:18.175
CHARTER. SCHOOLS ARE LUCKY

02:30:18.242 --> 02:30:20.177
ENOUGH TO HAVE AN- AN ANNUAL DAY

02:30:20.244 --> 02:30:22.079
. DEDICATE ON DOLLAR FOR. WHERE%

02:30:22.146 --> 02:30:26.250
IN OTHER SCHOOLS ARE NOT- SO WE

02:30:26.317 --> 02:30:27.151
SHOULD LOOK AT PARITY FOR THAT

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:29.687
AND REALLY A LOT OF THE DOLLAR

02:30:29.754 --> 02:30:30.321
SHOULD COME OUT OF NINETY EIGHT

02:30:30.388 --> 02:30:32.957
AS WELL. AS THEY DO FOR

02:30:33.023 --> 02:30:35.326
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS- BUT

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:37.962
A QUESTION FOR FINANCE IS I DO

02:30:38.028 --> 02:30:39.630
HAVE A QUESTION WHY WOULD THE

02:30:39.697 --> 02:30:42.266

PRIVATELY OWNED. FACILITY NOW

02:30:55.413 --> 02:30:56.380
FOR A PUBLIC ONE I THINK AN

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:58.749
ARGUMENT CAN BE MADE. BUT PUT.

02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:00.351

THINK MODEL CURRICULA

02:59:41.604 --> 02:59:42.838
