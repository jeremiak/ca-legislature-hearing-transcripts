UNDER THE MITIGATION FEE ACT A NEXUS STUDY MUST BE DONE TO ENSURE THERE'S A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FEES COLLECTED IN THE NEED FOR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SERVICE FACILITIES TO OFFSET THE STRING OF A GROWING COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY MANY LOCAL AGENCIES THAT COLLECT THESE FEES FAILED TO MEET THE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE MITIGATION FEE ACT. THE ACT IS CURRENTLY WITHOUT CORRECTIVE MEASURES FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WHICH CAN FORCE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT TO A COMPLETE HALT. S. B. TWELVE A TO WOULD TRIGGER AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT AND THE LOCAL AGENCY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE COST OF THE AUDIT.

MEMBERS A QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE HEARING ON SB NINE NO ONE HAS BEEN CANCELED. MOVING AHEAD OF TIME ITEM ONE FIFTY ONE S. B. NINE TEN MISTER COOK PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL NINE TEN BY SENATOR HERNANDEZ AND OTHERS AND I BELIEVE HEALTH INSURANCE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THAT AND THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS S. B. NINE TEN MAKES IT CLEAR THAT SHORT TERM LIMITED DURATION HEALTH INSURANCE MAY NOT BE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. THESE POLICIES INCLUDING SENSE EXTENSIVE HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRES USED BY THE CARRIER TO EITHER REJECT COVERAGE OR ONCE TREATMENT OCCURS TO DENY COVERAGE UNDER PREEXISTING CONDITION CAUSES. S. PLANS HAD OP HAVE OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUMS AS HIGH AS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. COVERAGE GAPS THAT RANGE FROM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT GAPS. THE THREE LARGEST CARRIES OF THIS INSURANCE HARPER SHORT TERM COVERAGE WITH MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS A 52% AND LOWER WHICH MEANS THAT. THEY'RE NOT SPENDING THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF MY MONEY ON CARE. HERE ARE THE PROBLEMS THAT CREATED BY ALLOWING THESE PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET. THE CENSUS GO WOMAN WAS HIT WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR CHARGE AFTER A SHORT TERM PLAN REFUSE COVERAGE FOR A HEART PROCEDURE. COUPLE PURCHASE ONE OF THESE POLICIES IN TWO MONTHS LATER THE HUSBAND HAD A HEART ATTACK. THE POLICY REFUSE TO COVER THE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MEDICAL BILLS. THIS ARE JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES SHORT TERM INSURANCE INCREASES THE COST TO BE CA PLANS BY DRAWING YOUNGER HEALTHIER PEOPLE OUT OF THE ACR MARKETS. ONLY TO REENTER WHEN THEY HAVE A HEALTHCARE CRISIS THE PROMOTION THESE PLANS IS THE SABOTAGE OF THE ACA ONE CARE OF THESE PRODUCTS OPERATE THE COMMISSION RATES AS HIGH AS 22%. AND BONUSES TO INSURANCE AGENTS OR SELLING SHORT TERM PLANS. OPPONENTS OF SHORT TERM LIMITED DURATION HEALTH INSURANCE ARGUE THAT THESE ARE NEEDED TO FOR LIFE TRANSITIONS ARE WHEN SOMEONE IS BETWEEN JOBS. THE ACA HAS SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIODS IF CERTAIN Y. TRANSITIONS OCCUR OUTSIDE OF OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIODS AND AN ELIGIBLE PER PERSON CAN ENROLL IN MEDICARE AT ANY TIME DURING THE YEAR. MEDI CAL HAS NO OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD WE ASK YOUR AIBO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I WANNA RICE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE -- SHORT TERM LIMITED DURATION PLANS. HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE MARKETPLACE BUT THE FACT IS THAT SHORT TERM CHARACTER. MUSIC AND LEAVE. THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES -- WITH THEM. THEY CREATE CONFUSION AS TO WHAT EXACTLY IS COVERED. THEY OFTEN FOR EXAMPLE DO NOT COVER MATERNITY COSTS. THEY'RE VERY PRACTICAL THINGS THAT MATTER THE LIVES OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT. TYPICALLY COVERED IN SHORT TERM PLANS OF THIS CHARACTER. SO YOU GET CONFUSED AS TO WHAT. WHAT THEY COVER? A AND THIS GETS COMPOUNDED SOME IS BECAUSE THE WAY IN WHICH YEAR SOLD. PEOPLE SOLD THESE PRODUCTS WAS SORT OF SHORTHAND DESCRIPTIONS WHAT'S THERE. LEADING TO CONFUSION. THEY DO NOT COVER PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT THIS MEANS THAT PEOPLE WHO RELY UPON THESE. CAN BE EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSSES. WHEN A CONDITION ARISES THAT THEY THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN COVERED IS NOT COVERED HERE'S FINANCIAL LOSSES IS PERSONAL EXPOSURE? THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH MATERNITY ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS ARE NOT TYPICALLY COVERED SO. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL. THAT WE WOULD. OPT TO BAN THEM ALL TOGETHER. THIS IS ACTUALLY. A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT EVEN BEFORE THE EVENTS OF LAST YEAR WITH THE ACA. THE PRODUCTS THEMSELVES ARE PROBLEMATIC -- SO I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A VERY. GOOD BILL A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. I THINK IT PROVIDES CLARITY. ABOUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN COVERAGE IT MEETS PEOPLE IN THEIR LIFE NEEDS. I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD PROPOSAL -- Y. ARE SENATE COLLEAGUE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARAMBULA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AS WELL IS OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SANTA ROSA. I STAND TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. NINE TEN THE INSURANCE WE PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS SHOULD NOT BE SUB PAR. TWO FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. IF AND IS BEING SOLD AS HEALTH COVERAGE IT SHOULD NOT BE SHORT TERM AND LACKING ANY COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS SUCH AS SOME OF THESE PLANS DO NOT EVEN COVER THE BASICS OF PRESCRIPTIONS DRUGS MATERNAL CARE OR MENTAL HEALTH. THEY ALSO LACK THE IMPORTANT ACA PROTECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF INSURANCE PROVIDE A FACADE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS HEALTHCARE NEEDS WILL BE COVERED. BUT IN REALITY THE ONLY MISLEAD CALIFORNIANS AND DESTABILIZE THE ACA MARKET. THIS DESTABILIZATION IN PART CAUSED BY THE SHORT TERM INSURERS IMPACTS THE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BY INCREASING PREMIUMS. FOR A CA HEALTH COVERAGE. THEREFORE WE SHOULD SUPPORT SENATE BILL NINE TEN IN ORDER TO ENSURE WE PROVIDE QUALITY HEALTHCARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY FOR THIS IMPORTANT VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I SPENT THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND FOR MANY YEARS SOLD. SHORT TERM POLICIES THEY HAVE A TRUE USE IN THE MARKETPLACE. MANY SELF EMPLOYED. NEED SHORT TERM INSURANCE. THIRTY DAYS SIXTY DAYS NINETY DAYS EXCEPT ERA. IN BETWEEN DIFFERENT OTHER ALTERNATIVES [inaudible] ALSO. SHORT TERM POLICIES. WHEN THEY'RE SOLD HAVE MANY MANY DECLARATIONS OF WHAT THEY DO AND DO NOT COVER? MANY CONSUMERS DON'T NEED MATERNITY THEY DON'T NEED MENTAL HEALTH. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT [inaudible] THAT. IS WELL SERVED BY SHORT TERM POLICIES THAT ARE DESIGNED AND SOLD. AS GAPS BETWEEN OTHER TYPES OF COVERAGE SUCH AS THEY SEE A GROUP PLANS EXCEPT. FOR SO THAT'S MY OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SEEN AT NO FOR THE DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THINK ABOUT A SPEAKER PERMITTING SHORT TERM LIMITED DURATION PLANTS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD TAKE ITS BACK TO THE DARK DAYS BEFORE THE AC. OR CHEAP JUNK INSURANCE POLICIES ARE AVAILABLE ONLY TO YOUNG HEALTHY PEOPLE AND THE REST ARE LEFT WITHOUT COVERAGE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CLICK PLEASE OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL THOSE VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. MR CLARKE YOU MAY CLOSE THE ROLE AND TALLY THE VOTES EYES FORTY THREE NO.

SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY TWO BY SANTA MONICA BACK RELATED CHILDREN'S HEALTH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I HAVE BEFORE US THAT BIPARTISAN BILL WITH NO OPPOSITION RELATE. TO KIDS MEALS AND HEALTHY BEVERAGES ESSENTIALLY THIS REQUIRE. A RESTAURANT WHICH PRIMARILY SERVES -- KNEELS MARKETED CHILDREN TO MAKE THAT DEFAULT DRANK AT HEALTHY DRINK Y. WATER OR MILK WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST. OF AN OBESITY AND DIABETES CROP. SO I THINK MANY PARENTS AND LOVED ONES WHO GO BUY A HAPPY MEAL ARE SHOCKED WHEN THEY REALIZE THAT A TRADITIONAL HAPPY MEAL DRINK. HAS NINE TEASPOONS OF SUGAR. AND WEAK SOMETIMES STILL GUILTY PUTTING THREE TEASPOONS OF SUGAR IN OUR COFFEE OR EVEN TO BUT I NINE AT TEASPOONS. FOR FIVE TEN THREE YEAR OLDS DRINK IS PROBABLY ISN'T GOOD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SO WHEN SIMON. AYE I THINK IS IS A BASED UPON THE PREMISE THAT KIDS MEALS STUDENT COME WITH A SIDE ORDER OF DIABETES. AND OBESITY OR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AN ASPIRIN I FELT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER -- COLLEAGUES I DON'T DISAGREE THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY LIMIT THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR NOT JUST IN OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES BUT IN OUR ALLIES BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S IN -- APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE STEPPING IN AND SORT OF TAKING THE PARENTS ROLE IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN THEN YOU AND YOU GO OUT TO EAT WHETHER IT'S AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT OR SIT DOWN RESTAURANT THING YOU HAVE NOTICED. THAT MOST OF THESE RESTAURANTS OFFER CHOICES IT'S NOT JUST A SODA THAT THEY GET WITH THE CHILD'S MAIL THERE MANY CHOICES AND THEN INCLUDES FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS IT'S NOT. NO LONGER IT'S NOT LIKE WHEN WE WERE. SO IT WAS THE ONLY OPTION NOW IT'S CHAU BUT MILK ORANGE JUICE OR ITS WATER SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THIS HAVING A SODA IS BEING FORCED UPON CHILDREN WHEN THEY'RE OUT TO EAT WITH THEIR PARENTS. IT ALSO DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT REALLY IF THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF SUGAR IN A CHILD'S DIET LIKELY THAT'S COMING FROM HOME BECAUSE MOST KIDS DON'T GO OUT TO EAT EVERY NIGHT WITH THEIR PARENTS. SO IF THEY'RE HAVING TOO MUCH SUGAR. IT'S COMING FROM HOME OR SCHOOL IT'S NOT COMING FROM GOING OUT TO EAT SO I'M NOT SURE REALLY HOW MUCH GOOD THIS WOULD DO ANYWAY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. IT IS IMPOSING A FINE ON RESTAURANT OWNERS BEFORE. I GUESS FOR NOT TAKING THE PLACE -- OF PARENTS IN FORCING THEM TO ASSUME THE PARENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CHILD'S HEALTHY FOR THAT REASON I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS.
