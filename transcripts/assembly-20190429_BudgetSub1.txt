GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR OF DR GIL CHAVEZ TIME DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR INFECTIONS THE SUCCESS THAT CV PH. AS YOU. PROBABLY HAVE HEARD IN THE NEWS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE TEST FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IT IS. NOW THE CASE THAT WE DID RECEIVE REPORTS FROM MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS TO THE CASES IN THE STATE EVERY YEAR. AND THAT'S ABOUT A 45% INCREASE FOR JUST THE LAST. FOUR YEARS. OUR PROVISIONAL DATA FOR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN I SHOWS THAT UNFORTUNATELY ON THE RATE OF INCREASE CONTINUES ON A AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE CASES WHEN THE DATA FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ARE FINALIZING WE SAW. IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I WITHIN THESE INCREASES SO WE KNOW THAT THE RATES OF EVERY SINGLE STV ARE INCREASING. BUT VERY CONCERNING OUR THE INCREASES IN THE RATES OF SYPHILIS. I AM PARTICULARLY WITHIN CITY POLICE THEIR CASES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. CONGENITAL SYPHILIS USED TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE NEVER SELL IN CALIFORNIA. NOW WE SEE A CASES REGULARLY. HI JOE STING TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALONE WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE CASES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. HI THIS CASES ARE VERY TRAGIC AND THEY ARE ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE. A AND THERE REALLY SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING. IN ADDITION IN THIS THE THE RATES WE SEE SOME SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES. WE SEE THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS PARTICULARLY COVERED DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RATES. HOT SO STV INCREASES ARE ALSO ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH EQUITY. AND AN ISSUE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. SO THE DEPARTMENT HAS A PROPOSAL FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO LOCAL ISSUES THINS. OUT SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN INVESTMENTS THAT YOU ALL MADE -- LAST YEAR WHERE WE WERE YOU FUNDED A STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL FOR THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. HI THAT STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL WAS FOUNDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS. ALSO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE GOOD WORK THAT IS HAPPENING ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. HOW MAY STOP IT WE DON'T CONTINUE THAT APPROPRIATION AND MAKE IT PERMANENT -- THEY WORK THAT IS BEING DONE NOW IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. IN INCREASING OUT REACH THE COMMUNITIES TO ENSURING THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN TO BE SCREENED AND TREATED -- AND ALL THE ALTHOUGH IT'S A VERY SMALL INVESTMENT WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE. A FOR THAT -- ROSHAN ON THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE FOR THE PROGRAM SO THAT IS OUR US FOR YOU TO THE THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER.

D. -- TRANSMISSION RATES IS UNKNOWN -- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IN THE SENATE HEARING LAST WEEK SENATOR PAN REQUESTED THAT OUR OFFICE WORK WITH FINANCE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH -- TO TRY TO COME UP WITH WHAT THE THE NUMBER THE AMOUNT WOULD BE TO TRY TO HALT AND REVERSE THIS TREND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS.

ISSUE NUMBER FOUR CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. FOR THE RECORD MONICA MORALIS CITY PH CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES OCCURRING -- DEAN CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO THIS IS A BUDGET PROPOSAL IS A FOUR YEAR PROPOSAL TOTALING TWENTY SIX FOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IT REALLY IS AN INITIATIVE TO UPDATE OUR EIGHTEEN LEAD. TO DATA SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN THE DEPARTMENT -- THE FIRST YEAR WERE REQUESTING EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND A NINE POINT THREE MILLION FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIVE POINT NINE MILLION FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THEN THREE POINT FOUR ONGOING -- MANY OF US HAVE BEEN HERE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE SCENE INTO A LOT OF THE CHANGES IN NEW MANDATES RELATED TO LEAD. AND WE'RE DOING A DECENT JOB IN THE DEPARTMENT I WAS SAY IN TERMS OF REALLY TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE NUMBER OF CHANGES AND THE NEW -- REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THE PART OF THAT ALSO MEANS THAT WE RELY ON OUR SYSTEMS TO REALLY PROVIDE US WITH THE REPORTING TECHNOLOGIES AND CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME BASIC QUESTIONS LIKE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN BEING SERVED FOR EXAMPLE AND SO FORTH AND STAKEHOLDERS SAID THAT WE WORK WITH. IN LABORATORY CENTER THAT ARE REPORTING INTO OUR SYSTEM. SO FOR US THIS IS AN ONGOING -- PROPOSAL THAT WE STARTED LAST YEAR WE GOT A OF B. C. P. APPROVED TO START THE PELL PROCESSES AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIS IS A CONTINUATION FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH STAGE THREE AND FOUR OF THE PROCESSES. OF IN NOT ONLY IMPACTS OBVIOUSLY CITY P. H. WE WORK WITH ABOUT FIFTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT WE CONTRACT WITH TO PROVIDE A LOT OF THE LEAD. CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INVESTIGATIONS AND THEY RELY ON THE SYSTEM AS WELL. CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE A VERY SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE WERE YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT WHEN YOU'RE. DOING FIELD WORK AT HOME WHERE YOU'RE DOCUMENTING SOME OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INVESTIGATIONS INTO LIKE A TABLET FOR EXAMPLE ARE. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO INTO THIS YOU KNOW HAVE A PAPER PROCESSING METHOD THAT WE'RE STILL USING AND SO OUR GOAL REALLY WITH THE SYSTEM IS TO TRY TO MOVE FORWARD IN ADVANCE. ARE REPORTING CASE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND MOST OF PARTY CATCH UP TO IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF OUR AUTOMATED -- DATA SO THAT'S WHAT THIS PROPOSES ABOUT -- MY COLLEAGUE GERRY CAN GIVE MORE EXAMPLES TO ON THE A. T. STEP. FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR US VERY GOOD THANK YOU -- STE SO THIS IS AN I. T. SYSTEM AND WE'RE REPLACING AN EXISTING AGING SYSTEM -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING AND PLANNING THIS PROJECT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND WE HAVE AT LEAST ANOTHER SIX MONTHS OF PLANNING BEFORE WERE ACTUALLY COULD GO INTO HAVE APPROVAL FOR DEVELOPMENT WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT IN. IN IDENTIFYING WHAT WHAT -- BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS WE NEED ON THE OUTCOME FROM THE SYSTEM. WE FEEL THAT THE REQUEST OF THE GOVERNOR BUDGET TODAY IS IS VERY REALISTIC AND IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE FOR THE TOTAL COST OF THIS PROJECT OVER THE THE THREE TO FOUR YEAR PERIOD. WE FEEL THE PROJECT HAS A HIGH RATE OF SUCCESS BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WE ARE DOING FOR THIS PROJECT. RE USING SOFTWARE THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN PLATFORMS OF SOFTWARE THAT -- LIKE G. I. S. AND CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN PRODUCTION TODAY AND SO WE'RE RECONFIGURING THOSE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF INTERNAL SKILLS. THAT LEAD TO LOWERING THE RISK OF FAILURE INCREASING THAT THE RISK FOR SUCCESS. THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE IS HIGHLY TUNED AROUND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE WOULD -- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THAT IT GETS -- APPROVED IN THAT WAY SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY DELAYS AND THE THE STAFF HIRING THAT WE MIGHT HAVE AND THE ACTUAL ONGOING CONTINUITY OF CONTRACTS BETWEEN FISCAL YEARS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS [inaudible] OKAY. LET'S HEAR THE CONCERNS OKAY -- SO YOU PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND WE DO NOT PARTICULARLY HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE MERITS OF THIS PROPOSAL WE DON'T DISAGREE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT I. T. SYSTEM -- AS WAS NOTED IN THE AGENDA OUR OUR OFFICE DID NOTE THAT THERE WERE. AS SEVEN DIFFERENT PROPOSALS -- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT REQUEST FULL IT PROJECT FUNDING BEFORE THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THE ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE HELL PROCESS WHEN IT WAS IMPLEMENTED WAS TO GIVE THE BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE -- MORE INFORMATION SO THAT THEY WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT TO THE THE ACTUAL COST OF IT PROJECTS AND ON TO THE THE ASSOCIATED TIMELINES WITH THE PROJECTS. THIS PARTICULAR REQUEST OF FOR FUNDING IS -- REQUESTING THE FULL FULL EIGHTY PROJECT FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION -- BEFORE THE THAT STAGES THREE AND FOUR OF THE PALO PROCESS. IS COMPLETE AND WHILE THE THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT MAY VERY WELL KEEP. ON SCHEDULE AND WITHIN COST WE DO RAISE SOME CONCERNS JUST ABOUT HOW THIS AFFECTS THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF IT PROJECTS NOT ONLY FOR THIS PROJECT BUT OR THE OTHER. PROJECTS THAT HAVE A SIMILAR APPROACH IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO WHAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND IS -- ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER APPROVING A SINGLE YEAR FUNDING pBACK NEXT YEAR AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE -- IN ORDER TO ADD PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- WHERE WE'RE BY FUNDING WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON -- APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE DOCUMENTS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY -- WITH NOTIFICATION TO THE APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS TO THE LEGISLATURE -- FOR ITS APPROVAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS -- ROB TROJAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALTHOUGH WE DEFINITELY KNOWLEDGE LA THOSE CONCERNS -- THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT. SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOR EXAMPLE THE CANNABIS LICENSING SYSTEM SO THEY HAVE THE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE AROUND THAT. THAT WOULD HELP DEVELOP THE PROPER REASONABLE ESTIMATES AND SO WE WOULD AGREE WITH AND THE CURRENT ESTIMATES THAT THEY HAVE. AND THEN THERE WOULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WITH AWARDING CONTRACT THE FULL FUNDING. WAS NOT -- WAS NOT APPROVED IN THE BUDGET BECAUSE THEY WILL BE -- FOR CARRYING THIS -- WHICH WE COMING UP IN OCTOBER IN THE FALL THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. ALL RIGHT PUBLIC COMMENT. NOW GOING BACK TO THE IS SAYING NO PUBLIC COMMENT -- BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO THEN GO BACK TO THE CONCERN FROM THE LA -- IT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN -- IS THERE A IT'S NOT THAT THE ART THAT I HAD ONLY CONSIDERED THE ONE YOU'RE FUNDING BUT I THINK HAVING THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IN THE PRODUCT AND THE PROJECT. ALONG WITH THE FUNDING OF WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT FEEL ABOUT THAT OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELL OUR OUR CONCERN WOULD BE ANY DISRUPTION TO THE FLOW OF THE PROJECT I MEAN WE HAVE SPENT OVER TWO YEARS PLANNING WE HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT CONTRACTS MULTI YEAR CONTRACT -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE POWER PROCESS WHICH IS -- FINAL APPROVAL BY THE PARTNER TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE TWO ONGOING OVERSIGHT REPORTAGE THAT OUR PUBLIC AND THAT CONTINUALLY MONTH AFTER MONTH MONITOR THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE PROJECT. SO HAVING TO COME BACK EVERY YEAR POTENTIALLY WITH ANOTHER VCP WOULD MEAN WE WOULD HAVE TO WRITE A B. C. P. TODAY FOR NEXT YEAR TO ENSURE WE HAVE NO LAPSE. AND IN SOME CASES A DEPENDING ON THE CONTRACT COULD BE RIGHT A MULTI YEAR CONTRACT WITHOUT HAPPENED WHEN NOT HAVING GUARANTEED FUNDING IT INTRODUCES A FEW ISSUES OF THE FLOW OF THE PROJECT. THE LAST THING WE'D EVER WANT IS NOT TO BE ABLE HIGHER OUR STAFF FULL TIME RATHER THAN LIMIT TO TERM WHO'D WANT TO BREAK IN A CONTRACT WHERE WE WOULD HAVE TO POTENTIALLY GO OUT TO BID AGAIN AND HIGHER DIFFERENT VENDOR. TO WORK THOSE THINGS COULD CAUSE THE DESTRUCTION THAT WERE WERE A TOTAL OF A AGREEMENT ALIGNMENT WITH TRANSPARENCY. A WHATEVER -- IT TAKES TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY IS IT THAT WE'RE TRANSPARENT AND WE MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS. BUT KNOWING HOW HEALTH PRIOR PROJECTS GO THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND EVEN FINANCE ON A REGULAR BASIS ON THE SUCCESS OF THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT OF A PROJECT. SO PALM I'M I I'D NOT SURE THAT BRING IT BACK THE LEGISLATURE EVERY YEAR IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE DONE IS A LOT OF EFFORT AND WORK TO PUT A BGP THROUGH OUR OUR COME BACK AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THAT IT'S PICKED A FULL. AND WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD TRACK RECORD AND WE'RE BUILDING ON KNOWN. PLATFORMS -- IF THIS WAS SOMETHING BRAND NEW I WOULD COULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT WE'VE INVEST A LOT OF TIME TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS. IT IT AS WAS NOTED IN THE HELP PROCESS THE LAST. TWO STAGES HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED. I MEAN THE WHOLE PURPOSES FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY -- AND I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE ALEJO. EXPRESSING THE CONCERNS IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT THE LEAD. TESTING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN. I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE TESTED TWICE AND THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OTHER DEPARTMENT THE NEEDS -- TO THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THANK YOU -- IF THE COMMUNICATION ISN'T. OPEN BETWEEN THE TWO I CAN TELL YOU THAT RECENTLY THERE WAS A HEARING ON THIS. AND TO SEE THAT MANY OF OUR CHILDREN ARE FALLING. BETWEEN THE CRACKS AND IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM -- BECAUSE THE RESULTS ARE DEVASTATING I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN I. T. SYSTEM. WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE CHILDREN AND IF WE DON'T DO THAT LET TESTING ON THE CHILDREN WE HAVE SOME MORE CAKE. PROCESS OF KEEPING TRACK. IT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM -- BUT I APPRECIATE LA OWES -- CONCERN AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT WITH US [inaudible] THANK YOU. MR MADAM CHAIR JUST A FEW QUESTIONS UP ON THAT SO. YOU'RE INTO THE DIFFERENT STAGES AND SO LAST TWO STAGES NOW THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO COMPLETE OF AN ONGOING PROJECT. FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT DIFFERENT NAM BUDGET CYCLES. WHAT THIS -- THAT THE PAGE ROOM RIGHT NOW IS THAT -- IS THEY CALL THE PAL PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE ON IT THE IT'S IN FOUR PHASES AND AT THE END YOUR GIVING AUTHORITY BY DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AN AGENCY. TO AWARD CONTRACTS AND MOVE FOR TO DEVELOPMENT SO WE HAVE A STARTING DEVELOPING YET WE'RE JUST LINING UP THE DIFFERENT CONTRACTS AND THE WORK EFFORT THAT WE NEED. TO GET READY AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS BY APARTMENT TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE. TEN MANAGEMENT PLAN SEARCH FOR CONTRACT AND STATE STREE IS FAIRLY EXTENSIVE WE'VE JUST FINISHED AGE THREE I'M RUNNING IT THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT FOR APPROVAL. AND THEN WE WOULD MOVE IN THE STATE FOR WHICH WOULD WE COULD RELEASE THE CONTRACT. AND GET THE RESPONSES BACK AND THEN WE WOULD DEPEND ON THE APARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO GIVE US AUTHORITY TO AWARD THE CONTRACT. THEN WE COULD START DEVELOPMENT SO YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE FULL POWER PROCESS YET BUT THE ACTUAL DOLLARS AND RECOMMENDATION AND STAFFING WAS DONE IN THE STAGE TO WHICH WAS FULLY APPROVED AND SUPPORTS THE BUDGET ACTION -- WE WILL BE GETTING APPROVAL. IN THE MIDDLE OF NEXT OF COUNTY OR AT THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. TWO OF STATE FOR THAT'S FOR WE THINK WE ARE AND WE WOULD NOT WANT ANY DELAYS AT THAT POINT -- WE WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO AWARD A CONTRACT AND GET STARTED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. I THINK THAT THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE -- IS SOMETHING IF IF THERE IS GOING TO BE. ANYTHING OTHER THAN A COMPLETE APPROVAL I THINK THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT -- PERHAPS THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALEJO AND STAFF CAN CAN WORK ON IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR YES -- I THINK ONE OF THE TRICKY THINGS ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE PROPOSAL IS IS ESSENTIALLY REQUESTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE GRANT IT'S APPROVAL AND FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT BEFORE. IT HAS THE BENEFIT OF SEEING THE FINALIZED PAL DOCUMENTS THE WAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THE ADMINISTRATION -- THEY'LL GET TO SEE THOSE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THEY GIVE THEIR FINAL APPROVAL AND IN THIS CASE THEY'RE REQUESTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DO SO WITHOUT THAT BENEFIT SO [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE HOME VISITING PROGRAM EXPANSION. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M LESS LIKE THE CHIEF OF THE AND C. H.

AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT I HAD HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN THAT HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS WE RECOGNIZE IMPACTS OF THINGS LIKE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TAYLOR -- MODELS BASED ON THE POPULATIONS OF OUR IN OUR COMMUNITIES ON THE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST MENTION AS IN REGARDS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S TIMELINE WE DON'T HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT OTHER TO THAN TO SAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION. ABOUT WHETHER THAT TIMELINE MAKE SENSE OR WHETHER THERE'S EXPANSIONS THAT COULD BE HAPPENING SOONER OR ON A DIFFERENT TIME LINE AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE FURTHER ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TELL US YOUR NAME AND YOUR IS -- ORGANIZATION AGAIN PLEASE -- MICHELLE GIBBONS WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE SUPPORT BOTH THE FUNDING AS WELL AS THE EXPANSION OF THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM THANKS. THANK YOU. LINDA TENER WHAT'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA PANDA THINK HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I CAN LOS WITH REPRESENTING CHILDREN NOW AND I SAY THAT WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR FOR PROPOSING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT. C. H. P. P. PROGRAM AND THE DEPARTMENT'S COMMITMENT TO EXPAND BEYOND THE TWENTY THREE COUNTIES IN THE EXISTING. I'M TO EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS HOME VISITING CURRENTLY REACHES ABOUT 2% OF CALIFORNIA BABIES BUT WE KNOW THAT AS MANY AS 60%. I'M COULD BENEFIT FROM THE ASSN SEVEN REALLY TO ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY GET THESE PROGRAMS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE CHILDREN NOW. AVERAGES -- THAT WE SUPPORT IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT FURTHER STUDY THE ADOPTION OF EXISTING EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING PROGRAM MODELS THAT ARE MEETING THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. MATERNAL INFANT AND EARLY CHILDHOOD HOME VISITING CRITERIA AS A LIST OF MODELS ALLOWABLE UNDER SIEGE V. P.. AND THAT WE ESTABLISH A PROCESS TO ISSUE CONTRACTS EXISTING AND NEW COUNTIES NO LATER THAN JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY AS PART OF THIS PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS THE FUNDS -- AND THAT WE ASSESS AS STEPS TO SET ASIDE NOT TO EXCEED TWENTY FIVE ART BY PERCENT OF THE EXISTING FUNDS. TO SUPPORT LOCAL INNOVATIONS TO PROMISING AREN'T PROGRAMS FOR NEW MODELS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ASKING ON BEHALF OF THE NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE EXPANSION OF SIEGE V. P. THIS YEAR AND OF P. IS ONE OF THE EXISTING MODELS -- WE ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONCEPT OF LOOKING AT THE BESTDATA IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT WHICH POPULATIONS -- BENEFIT BEST FROM WHICH TYPE OF HOME VISITING MODELS UP LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND WITH DPH AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURING OUT WHAT. POPULATIONS WOULD BE BEST SERVED BY DIFFERENT MODELS WE HOPE TO BE CONSIDERED AND THAT. ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE SOME OF THE EXPLANATION OF HOW THE GROWTH WOULD HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS SO WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOME ROOM FOR GROWTH AND EXPANSION. PARTICULARLY IN A COUPLE OF THE COUNTIES THAT AND IF PIECE SERVES WHERE WE'VE HAD TO CAP OR SERVICES DUE TO COST OF LIVING INCREASES NOT BEING ABLE TO BE COMMENSURATE. WITH THE EXISTING FUNDING THAT WE GET SO WE APPRECIATE THIS BUDGET ITEM AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU THANK YOU -- OCCURS ON BEHALF OF THE MARCH DOWN THE SUPPORT GROUP THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I'M SURE THANK YOU AND AND TO ALLOW VERY LITTLE ONE OF THE PUBLIC SPEAKER AS FAR AS A TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. IS THAT WITHIN THE PLAN OR OR HOW DO YOU SEE THAT WORKING OUT WITHIN THE SOME BUDGET REQUESTS. CURRENTLY WE WE FIND. THAT TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS DRIVING THE MICROPHONE CLOSE FROM SORRY CURRENTLY THERE IS DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM -- THAT THE TRIBES ARE IMPLEMENTING AND I THINK THAT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB REACHING OUT TO THEM AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THEIR MODELS ARE WORKING AND HOW THIS NEW. NEW. OPPORTUNITY CAN HELP MEET THE NEEDS THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE CURRENTLY MATT. SO SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE BEING USE ARE BEING PROPOSED. ARE THOSE BEST PRACTICES -- BEING USED WITHIN THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I WE HAVE TITLE FIVE FUNDING OUR OUR BLOCK GRANT FUNDS GO TO SUPPORT HOME VISITING WITHIN THE TRIBES AND I KNOW THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON A JOHN HOPKINS EVIDENCE BASED MODEL. BUT WE WE CAN CERTAINLY BE CIRCLING BACK AROUND TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF OUTCOMES ARE GIVEN GETTING JUXTAPOSED TO THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH AND IF PM HFA MODELS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK GETTING A REPORT -- BASED ON THAT AS FAR AS THE TROUBLE COMMUNITIES AND HOW BEST PRACTICES ARE BEING USED THEIR ALSO BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE BEING PRESENTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S CONSISTENCY -- OUT THERE AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT ALL ARE BEING SERVED UP UNDER THE STYLUS. THANK YOU MISTER ABBAS. THE COUNTY IS BEING SERVE THE TWENTY THREE COUNTIES BEING SERVED -- IT JUST SO HAPPENS OF THREE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE. ARE ALL FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND THAT IS NOT ONE OF THE COUNTIES -- IN THE EXPANSION. THE WORD IS SANDRA DINO -- FOR SAN BERNADINO ABSOLUTELY SAMBAR MEDINA WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE FUNDS WE WE'D WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT HOLES IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT. NOT ONLY HAS FIRST FIVE STEPPED UP TO FIND HOME VISITING PROGRAMS BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE CURRENT CAL WORKS EXPANSION HAS HAS A FORTY COUNTIES WITH ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO DO HOME VISITING. SO THAT'S WHY THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS SO IMPORTANT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE WHERE HAVE OTHERS PICKED UP AND FUNDED HOME VISITING PROGRAMS. AND WILL WHO HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND SO THAT'S OUR OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY IDENTIFY THOSE COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR HOME VISITING. AND MAYBE NOT HAVE ENOUGH FUNDS TO REACH ALL THE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN NEED. WHEN I SEE? SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO. INCLUDED IN THE COUNTIES THAT OUR AT THAT ARE RECEIVING -- THE HOME VISITING -- I CAN'T IMAGINE. THAT THEY DON'T ALSO HAVE THE FIRST FIVE AND THE OTHERS. COULD. PROVIDE SOME OF THAT SERVICE SO IT IS A GREAT CONCERN THAT THE LARGEST COUNTY. IN THE STATE. WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED. I RECOGNIZE IT RIVERSIDE IN FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE IS ON THE LIST BUT NONE THE LESS -- KNOWING HOW THE COUNTY USE ARE SELECTED AND GOING BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION. REGARDING HOW THE SELECTIONS. ARE MADE ON INVEST MODELS BEING USED AT EACH. ONE I THINK IS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. DO YOU HAVE CRITERIA. THAT WILL BE USED TO YOU HAVE THE LIST OF CRITERIA THAT WILL BE USED IN DETERMINING WHAT COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE INCLUDED. THAT WILL EXPANSION STATEMENT THAT WILL HAPPEN DURING YOUR ONE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEEDS WE WANT IT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE ARE GOING TO EMBARK ON WITH THESE WITH THIS WITH THESE NEW MONIES ARE REALLY GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET CURRENTLY SORE FUNDING CRITERION WHO WERE GOING TO BE FUNDING REALLY IS GOING TO BE DICTATED THROUGH THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. AND WE WANT TO SEEK INPUT FROM THE COUNTIES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT FUNDING CRITERIA NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE AND WE WILL BE PUTTING TOGETHER A METHODOLOGY THAT WILL THAT WE WILL SEEK INPUT ON AND APPROVAL FOR IT. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE AN IDEA ON WHAT IS GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT. WE CURRENTLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WOMEN ARE WHAT WHAT WOMEN ARE CURRENTLY IN HOME VISITING PROGRAMS WHERE THE PSYCHO SOCIAL ISSUES ARE OCCURRING IN IN WHICH NEIGHBORHOODS. ARE THE COUNTIES LIKE IN LA ABLE TO REACH THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM. DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT. NURSE OR HOME VISITOR. IN THE RIGHT LOCATION TO DELIVER THE SERVICES SO WE'VE GOT WE HAVE A A ROBUST NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT TO REALLY GET A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS WHAT IS BEING CURRENTLY CARRIED OUT. AND WHO ISN'T BEING LEFT BEHIND HELLO. HOW ARE YOU GOING? TO WHAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT OFTEN COMES UP IS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SOME COUNTIES ARE SOME ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE BETTER AT WRITING PROPOSALS KLAY AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DETERMINE THE NEEDS OF A COMMUNITY. AND YOU ASK THE THE COMMUNITY WHAT ARE YOUR NEEDS IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT EVERYBODY ELSE IS LOOKING AT THEY WON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD BE SAYING. WHERE IS IF THERE IS A LIST ALREADY OF WHAT IT IS YOU'RE LOOKING -- FOR IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THE COUNTIES ARE THE CITIES OR THE COMMUNITIES ARE BEING LEFT OUT WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THEY CAN ASK. OF THAT THEY CAN ASK FOR AND IF THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING ASSESSED. THEN THEY WON'T KNOW TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT. BUT THAT ALWAYS IS A A MAJOR CONCERN. SO WE PARTNER QUITE CLOSELY WITH OUR MATERNAL CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH DIRECTORS IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES SO THEY HAVE THEIR POLLS ON EXCUSE ME. FOR INTERRUPTING IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES THAT YOU ALREADY FUND OR IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE A REGULAR READ -- ON GOING DISCUSSION AND RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE MONTHLY MEETINGS WE HAVE BIANNUAL TODAY THREE DAY MEETINGS WITH OUR LOCAL NCH DIRECTORS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE THEY ARE COMPLETING A A TITLE FIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO REALLY ASSESS THE COMPREHENSIVELY ALL THE NEEDS OF WOMEN'S CHILDREN USE CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS WITH IN THEIR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION. SO THEY'VE BEEN SPENDING A YEAR LOOKING AT THE NEEDS WE ENVISION THAT THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL BE ON THE HEELS OF THIS ROBUST NEEDS ASSESSMENT. SO THEY HAVE THEIR POLLS ON WHAT'S GOING ON AND HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS. AND AND WE BELIEVE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AND NOT JUST STANDING BACK AT THE STATE AND SAYING HERE'S YOU SHOW ME THAT SHOW ME THE PAPER BUT REALLY DIALOGUING AND HAVING IN PERSON MEETINGS TO UNDERSTAND. FACE TO FACE WHETHER THE NEEDS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITHIN YOUR COUNTIES. BECAUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE SERVICE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ABSOLUTE AND THAT FOR THOSE FAMILIES THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE THE HOME VISITS. THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BENEFIT THAT'S RIGHT BUT OF GREAT CONCERN. ESPECIALLY IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THE THREE OF US SITTING HERE AT THE DICE ARE ALL FROM SAMBAR TO DO YOU KNOW REPRESENT. PARTS OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. AND TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS. WE'RE JUST ONE OF THE COUNTIES. BUT WE HAVE MANY OTHERS WHO ARE ALSO EXCLUDED. MR ROMS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST GOING BACK TO THE THE DATA COLLECTION AND REACHING OUT TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES I HEARD THAT CORRECT RIGHT. SO -- AND AND LOOKING AT THE LIST OF THOSE THAT ARE READY -- ENGAGED IN AND SOME OF THESE HOME VISITING MOM THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. DOES THE THE DATA TAKEN TO COLLECTION URBAN SUBURBAN -- AS FAR AS THOSE COUNTIES IN THE SEPARATION OF THOSE -- AREAS WHERE THEY'RE AT IT WELL AND IT DOES YES SIR A COUNTY THE SIZE OF SAN BENITO COUNTY. DEALS WITH ALL THOSE RURAL SUBURBAN AND URBAN -- ASK EVEN OF ITS DESIGNATED URBAN COUNTY BUT STILL THE NEED IS THERE. SO IF ALL THAT DATA IS COMING IN HOW THEN I MEAN YOU'RE DEALING WITH FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HOW THEN DO YOU START TO LOOK AT WHERE. THAT MONEY IS STARTING TO GO OR AS FAR AS THOSE THAT ARE GONNA BE COMPETING. HOW TO THE RIGHT FOR THAT GRANT BASED ON THAT CRITERIA THAT'S COMING IN AND IS THERE A CRITERIA MODEL -- GIVEN TO THE COUNTIES AHEAD OF TIME SO THEY CAN START TO PLAN AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE PERFORMING. IN AREAS THAT. WILL BE SEEN -- POSSIBLE -- POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE GRANT MOVING FORWARD. SO THERE'S THAT THE NF P. AND HFA THEY HAVE MODEL CRITERIA THAT THAT. THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN IMPLEMENTED WILL WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES THEIR THEIR EVIDENCE BASED MODEL SO THERE ARE SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR THE TWO MODELS THAT THAT WE IMPLEMENT. SO WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF IMPLEMENTING OTHER MODELS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT CRITERIA? AND SO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE EMBARKING ON IN YOUR ONE SO WHEN YOU'RE. THREE WERE IMPLEMENTING A DIFFERENT MODEL WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF CRITERIA TO MEET AN AND MATT NEED IN THE COMMUNITY. TO MAKE SENSE. YEAH BUT IS A SEPARATE IT TOWARDS URBAN SUBURBAN ARE -- ROLE AS FAR AS THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AT THAT AND THE DATA IS BEING COLLECTED OR HOW THOSE GRANTS ARE COMING FORWARD. INVEST MODELS USED IN THE THAT KERR PARTICULAR SETTING. I'M OR IS IT JUST. IT'S BROUGHT IT'S BROUGHT IS BY COUNTY WE WE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KNOWING THE VET THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTY. WHETHER IT'S URBAN RURAL OR POCKETS WITHIN IT WITH IN A CITY IS UP TO THE M. C. H. DIRECTORS AND WE LIE ON RELY ON THEM FOR THEIR EXPERTISE TO TRULY UNDERSTAND. HOW BEST TO CARRY FORWARD PROGRAMS AND SO USING THE LENS OF OUR HOME VISITING MODEL? WHAT MODELS THEN BECAUSE MODELS HAVE CRITERIA WHAT CRITERIA THEN DO WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT IN THE COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT WITH THIS INVESTMENT? THANK YOU. FOR THE TEST IT IS AN IN IT AND WE WANT TO SPEND THE TIME AND THE VERY THOUGHTFUL IN THIS REVIEW SO THAT WE TRULY UNDERSTAND WHO'S BEING LEFT BEHIND BUT COUNTIES AREN'T BEING FUNDED WHAT POPULATIONS ARE NOT BEING FUNDED. AND THEN DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT MODELS IN PLACE THAT HAVE THE CRITERION THE FIDELITY TO THE MODEL TO CLOSE THE GAPS IN THOSE NEEDS. VETERAN COLLECTING DATA ON DEMOGRAPHICS EIGHT ON CLIENTS CORRECT CORRECT CURRENT. SO AS PART OF THE TWO MODELS THAT WE USE THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM THER MODELS THAT ARE BEING USED BY OTHER PROGRAMS AS WE COLLECT A LOT OF DATA ON OUR CLIENTELE. AND WE HAVE A TEAM OF EPIDEMIOLOGISTS WHO WHO ARE ANALYZING THAT DATA SO. WELL THAT WHILE THE PROGRAM MIGHT LOOK AT SAN BERNADINO AS A WHOLE WERE ABLE TO DRILL DOWN BY PROBABLY BY ZIP CODE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT COME AND KNOW THAT. THIS GROUP OF WOMEN HERE. IN THIS AREA ARE MORE RURAL THAN THE GROUP OF WOMEN OVER HERE IN A MORE URBAN ZIP CODE SO WE DO DEFINITELY ARE COLLECTING DATA AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRILL DOWN AND LOOK AT OUR DATA. AND LOOK AT WHO'S BEING SERVED AND THEIR OUTCOMES BENCHMARKS. AND THEN LOOK AT THE THE BEST -- MODELS BEING USED IN THOSE PARTICULAR -- ENVIRONMENTS WITH THE DEBT IS BEING COLLECTED SO SO WE WILL BE COLLECTING DATA FROM THE TWO MODELS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY USING SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE OUTCOMES FROM THAT DATA AND THEN IN ADDITION. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT WHAT OTHER PROGRAMS ARE BEING FUNDED IN THOSE COUNTIES NOT BY US BUT BY DSS OUR FIRST FIVE WHAT WHERE ARE OTHER SERVICES BEING OFFERED IN TRYING TO FIND AT THE GAPS IN SERVICES WHERE ARE. IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY PERHAPS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS GAP BECAUSE WE ARE NOT THERE OR MAYBE THERE'S FIRST FIVE IS DOING A REALLY GREAT JOB WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND BUT BECAUSE OF THAT PARTICULAR MODEL THEY'RE USING. THERE IS A NEED FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PROGRAM AND SO WE MIGHT THINK WOW WELL THERE'S THE GAP THAT WE NEED TO FILL IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT OUR DATA AND THEN WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT'S BEING OFFERED BY OTHER PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE GET A CUMULATIVE LOOK AT WHAT'S THERE. GOING BACK TO DATA -- DO WE HAVE THE DATA ABOUT. THAT SHOWS HOW MANY. MOTHERS HOW MANY FAMILIES ARE BEING SERVED IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES. YES WE DO COULD YOU PROVIDE THAT TO US YES AND IF IF ANY OF THE TRIBES ARE BEING -- SERVICE COULD YOU PUT BE SPECIFIC IF THEY'RE THERE ARE SPECIFIC TRIBES ARE BEING SERVED ABSOLUTELY. EARLIER YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD BRING BACK THE NEW MODEL FOR APPROVAL. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT PLEASE SO WE HAVE WE HAVE AN APPROVAL PROCESS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THROUGH OUR CENTER FOR FAMILY HEALTH AND THROUGH OUR OUR NCH DIRECTORS AS A COLLECTIVE. THAT THE MODELS THAT WE'RE SELECTING ARE ARE SOMETHING THAT THAT ARE GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS AND SO WE WE JUST. WE DON'T MAKE IT IN A VACUUM WE HAVE WE'VE GOT INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT A HAVE AN APPROVAL QUOTE UNQUOTE APPROVAL PROCESS WERE GETTING INPUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SELECTING THE BEST THE BEST MODEL. INPUT FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS CORRECT AND THEN ALL. STAKEHOLDERS MEANING ARE AND STAGE DIRECTORS AND OTHER CBO IS ON THE GROUND THAT WOULD HAVE INTEL ON THE POPULATION. I THINK THAT THE THE BIGGEST CONCERN. THE WE'VE HEARD FROM ADVOCATES HAS TO DO WITH HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO IMPLEMENT. AND I THINK GOING BACK TO THE COMMENTS THE STAFF COMMENTS. ON PAGE. TWENTY ABOUT WHETHER THESE ACTIVITIES COULD OVERLAP. EACH OTHER IN YEAR. ONE AND I THINK YOU SAID THAT THEY COULD. WELL WE'RE WORKLOAD THE WORKLOAD OVERLAPS BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOT SO IN THE FIRST YEAR DEFINITELY WE WILL HAVE MORE MONEY OUT TO OUR EXISTING -- ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S SIMPLE TO GET MORE. GET AGREEMENTS AMENDED AND GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR. IT'S GOING TO TAKE US LONGER TO LOOK AT WHERE THE GAPS ARE. AND ANALYZE WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO THEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO CHOOSE. DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. AND MOVE THAT MONEY OUT. SO THAT'S THE IT IT CERTAINLY THE WORK WILL BE HAPPENING IN YEAR ONE BUT WE WON'T GET TO THE END AND BE READY TO IMPLEMENT IN YOUR ONE SO WHAT IN YEAR ONE IT IT'S EXPANSION OF EXISTING SITES. SO PROVIDING MORE MONEY TO THOSE COUNTIES WHICH ARE ALREADY GIVING MONEY. TO EXACTLY SO THAT THEY CAN EXPAND THEIR CASELOAD WITHIN. THEIR AREA OF REACH. I CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR SAN BERNADINO COUNTY I DON'T LIKE THAT IDEA. BUT I UNDERSTAND. AND OF MY COLLEAGUE IS NOT FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY BUT WE WE CLAIM HER BECAUSE SHE HAS SHE HAS TAUGHT IN OUR COUNTY THAT'S RIGHT. REMEMBER THAT CALIFORNIA. THAT'S RIGHT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MS ROOM. ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA STAY RIGHT HERE ALL RIGHT TO THE NEXT ISSUE NUMBER SIX BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM EXPANSION. OTHER CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN ITS OVERALL INFANT MORTALITY RATE AND ITS CURRENT AND IS CURRENTLY RANKED THIRD IN THE NATION WITH THE LOWEST INFANT MORTALITY RATE. THE RATE OF MORTALITY AMONG BLACK INFANTS DYING BEFORE THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY CONTINUES TO BE MORE THAN TWO TIMES HIGHER. THAN WHITE INFANTS KALIFORNIA ALSO RANKS FIRST IN THE NATION WITH THE LOWEST MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE GET AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHERS ARE NEARLY FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM PREGNANCY RELATED CAUSES THAN WHITE MOTHERS. YEAH IMPROVEMENTS IN CLOSING THE GAP BETWEENBLACK WHITE INFANT AND MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES HAVE BEEN MADE IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE SO ALL FAMILIES REGARDLESS OF RACE REALIZE THEIR DREAMS. CD PH REQUESTS FOR POSITIONS AND SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN GENERAL FUNDS. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN STATE OPERATIONS AND SEVEN MILLION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE IN STATE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER TO EXPAND OUR B. I. H. PROGRAM TO IMPROVE PLAQUE MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH. CITY PH REQUEST FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF OUR CURRENT AT THE I. H. MODEL. INCLUDING ADDING STRATEGIES TO INCREASE PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION DATA COLLECTION EXPANSION OVER B. H. SITES AS WELL AS MODEL REFINEMENT. IN YEAR ONE WE WILL FINALIZE OUR EVALUATION OF R. B. I. H. PROGRAM WE WILL INVEST IN THE EXPANSION AND RETENTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT CURRENT THE I. H. SITES. WE WILL EXPAND THE CURRENT B. I. H. DATABASE AND SET PERFORMANCE MEASURES. AND DEVELOP A STATEWIDE DISPARITIES AWARENESS PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. IN YOUR TO WE WILL CONDUCT A MODEL A. B. I. H. MODEL REVISION BASED ON OUR EVALUATION RESULTS WE WILL PROVIDE TA TO IS EXISTING B. I. H. SITES AND RELEASE AN RFA. TO ALLOW EXPANSION OF B. I. H. TWO NEW TARGETED VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE EXCUSE ME COMMUNITIES. WE WERE IN YOUR THREE WILL WILL COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA PERFORMANCE MEASURES HOMEOWNER MODEL FIDELITY AND MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF OUR PROGRAM. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EFFORTS WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND BLACK WOMEN THAT DELIVER IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR HAVE AN EQUAL CHANCE OF HAVING A HEALTHY BABY. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. WELL I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS ANOTHER. VERY GOOD INVESTMENT ON THE GOVERNOR'S -- ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR AND I THANK HIM FOR THAT [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. LET'S BRING IT TO THE TO THE PUBLIC FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. MICHELLE GIVENS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE TO APPLY THE GOVERNOR FOR THIS INVESTMENT WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT ONE THING THAT I'VE HEARD FROM MY MEMBERS WHO ARE THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS IS THAT THE BACK INTO HEALTH PROGRAM AS IT STANDS TODAY IS VERY. PRESCRIPTIVE AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IT'S NOT WORKING AND GIVING US THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN ADDRESSING% AFRICAN AMERICAN MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY -- I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THE IMPLEMENTED AT A DIFFERENT STRATEGY -- THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY IN LINE WITH THE BACK INTO HEALTH PROGRAM BUT THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING REALLY FAST TURNAROUND IN THEIR DATA AND SEEING -- ALLOW YOU TO READ OF THE DISPARITIES BEING ADDRESSED AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY AS THE BACK INTO HEALTH PROGRAM HAS THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND DEDICATED TO IT TO REALLY OPEN THE CONVERSATION AROUND WHAT INTERVENTIONS COULD WORK ALLOWING US AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO TEST DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODELS. BASED ON THE POPULATIONS THAT WE SERVE AND THE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE AND REALLY TRYING TO SEE IF THAT WE CAN BUILD SOMETHING THAT IS EVIDENCE BASE THAT COULD APPLY. AND IT MAY NOT BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY CONSIDERING THE HEALTH DISPARITIES. FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AND MATERNAL MATURE MORTALITY AND BLACK AND THEN A WEEK TO APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR AND THE SUPPORT THIS REQUEST THANK YOU THANK YOU. ON BEHALF OF THE MARCH OF DIMES OUT LIKE THAT COMMA COMMENTS OR THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES PART PART OF ME -- MARCH OF DIMES AND AS DENNIS SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WANTED -- TO WHAT'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK ALSO IN SUPPORT -- WE FIND THAT THIS RECALLS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WILL TRULY -- IMPROVE THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND AND CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I APPRECIATED THE COMMENT ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED. SO WE HAVE AS YOU MAY KNOW WITH YOU ALL -- THE GOVERNOR GAVE US MONEY LAST YEAR FOR SOMETHING CALLED THE PERINATAL EQUITY INITIATIVES THAT WE RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP AUGMENT OUR BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM. WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE THAT TOXIC STRESS IS A IS A KEY COMPONENT OF POOR BIRTH OUTCOMES AMONG SAYS POPULATION WE KNOW THAT ARE BLACK AND THAT HEALTH PROGRAM IS DESIGNED. TO ADDRESS THIS TOXIC STRESS THAT THESE BLACK WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ARE THAT OUR OUR EVALUATION DATA IS ANALYZED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS WORKED AND WHAT HASN'T AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT HAS IMPACTED THIS TOXIC STRESS THAT IS OCCURRING. SO WE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE MODEL REFINEMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY WE LOOK FORWARD TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE DATA IS TELL US TELLING US. IN ORDER TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON HOW TO READJUST THE MODEL GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE WOMEN THAT WE INTEND TO SERVE. WE KNOW THAT THE PERINATAL EQUITY INITIATIVE HAS INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL AUGMENT THE CORD BE AYE EACH PROGRAM WE SEE IT AS A WRAP AROUND. TWO RBI H. PROGRAM AND WE ARE WORKING CURRENTLY WITH COUNTIES WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN IN PERSON MEETING TOMORROW TO TALK ABOUT WHAT M. INTERVENTIONS ARE REALLY GOING TO HELP SUPPORT AND AUGMENT. THE THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED AT THE COUNTIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE WOMEN THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING SERVED. THANK YOU SO CONSISTENCY AND SOME FLEXIBILITY YEAH. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M HAPPY SANTA KERR IN THE NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY. AND I'M AND I'M SICK OF A INCIDENT OCCURRED DOCTOR FOR THE CIRCLE OF CARE QUALITY. SO THE BRACES ST OVERVIEW OF OUR ESTIMATE AS REQUESTED. SO THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY SERVICE MANY ROLES FOR CD PH ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT ROLES IS OUR LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WHERE WE OVERSEE AND THE REGULATE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF OVER TEN THOUSAND FACILITIES. IN THIRTY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FACILITY TYPES WE ALSO OVERSEE THE CERTIFICATION OF NURSE ASSISTANTS HOME HEALTH AIDS HE MEANT ON DIALYSIS TECHNICIANS AND LICENSING OF NURSING HOME ADMINISTRATORS. OTHER ROLES THAT WE SERVE OUR ALL SU THE PROGRAM FOR HEALTH CARE SATIATED INFECTIONS -- SO ARE H. I. A PROGRAM WHICH SERVES MORE OF IT PREVENTION AND SURVEILLANCE ROLE -- TO PROTECT -- HOSPITAL ACQUIRED INFECTIONS IF YOU WELL. SO FOR FUNDING SOURCES WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES SOME OF THEM ARE OBVIOUSLY ARE FUND THIRTY NINETY EIGHT WHICH IS OUR PENALTY FIND WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT GROUNDS WE DO REIMBURSEMENTS ASSOCIATE WITH AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- AND SOME GENERAL FUND. FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR AS AN OVERVIEW WE THE BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATED. TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION TO CD PH N.

WIDE -- VACANCY RATE IS NOW DOWN 26% -- RIGHT NOW WE'RE UNDERGOING -- AS SEVERE OR WHAT I WOULD SAY -- RETHINKING OF HOW WE DO OUR WORK -- WE HAVE CURRENTLY ALREADY CURRENT STATE -- PROCESS MAPPED ALL OF OUR LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES FOR EVERY TOUCH POINT THAT WE THAT WE INTERSECT WITH OUR FACILITIES AND PROVIDERS. AND WE ALSO DID A FUTURE STATE -- LEAN SIX SIGMA -- PROCESSING MAP TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH MORE STREAMLINED WAYS SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE -- WE ALSO NOW ARE. GOING TO BE RESTRUCTURING SOME OF OUR DISTRICT OFFICE FACILITIES -- HOW WE DO OUR WORK AND REALIGNING IT WITH HEADQUARTERS AND -- THE WHOLE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO START TO ONCE WE HAVE THIS NEW PROCESSES TO THEN AND FUSE IT WITH TECHNOLOGY. IT'S THE THEN WERE ABLE TO USE -- MODERNIZED WAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SERVING IN OUR FACILITIES CURRENTLY WE OVERSEE OVER TEN THOUSAND FACILITIES THROUGH MAINLY MANUAL PROCESSES AND PAPER OR ELECTRONIC MANUAL PROCESSES RATHER THAN AUTOMATED PROCESSES THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR HUGE GOAL OVER THE NEXT. ONE TO TWO YEARS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. SENATE PADDOCK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR OFFICE WOULD JUST NOTICE SORT OF ECHO WHAT -- IS STARTING HER SAID IS THAT IT'S AT THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY ISRAEL HAS REALLY BEEN GOING UNDER GOING AT A TRANSITION AND HOW IT DOES. ITS WORK I MEAN IT REALLY CAME UNDER FIRE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO FOR SOME SOME PROBLEMS IN THE QUALITY OF THEIR WORK IN THAT AND BACKLOGS IN THE TIMELINESS OF RESPONSES. AND YOU KNOW OUR OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR PROGRESS WE EXPECT AT SOME POINT TO THE STAFFING LEVELS THE FEES -- THE BACKLOGS -- YOU KNOW THE APPROACHES THE A. T. IMPLEMENTATION ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL START TO STABILIZE AT SOME POINT IN A A YOU KNOW IT'S AT THAT POINT THAT WILL REALLY EXPECT TO START SEEING. THE RESULTS FROM FROM ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS. WE CAN YOU [inaudible] VERY GOOD [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. NO DIFFERENT FINANCE. ALL RIGHT LET'S OPEN IT UP TO THE PUMP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS BARBER GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE FEE INCREASE PROPOSED IN THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET. AND LET LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT ILLUSTRATES WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RATE OF INCREASE SINCE THIS IS THE SIXTH YEAR IN A ROW WHERE WE'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ABOUT. 20%. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN A TWO HUNDRED BED HOSPITAL PAID A LICENSING FEE OF ABOUT FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT SAME HOSPITAL IS GOING TO PAY A FEE OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS YEAR THIS IS A TWO HUNDRED BED HOSPITAL IF THAT HOSPITAL IS LOCATED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THEY WILL PAY IT WILL PAY A FEE OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WE'VE SEEN A STEADY INCREASE HAPPENING OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS WE DO WONDER WHEN IS THIS GOING TO LEVEL OUT. THE WORK THE DEPARTMENT DOES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE'RE NOT QUESTIONING THAT AT ALL BUT WE'RE NOT SEEN A CORRESPONDING TIMELINESS IN RESULTS SO I I'M JUST HERE TODAY TO APPLE OUR CONCERNS WITH THESE BEING CREASES. THEY DO ADD TO THE OVERALL COST OF HEALTH CARE [inaudible] THANK YOU. JENNIFER SIGNED ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HOPE FACILITIES AS REPRESENTS OVER NINE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND FOUR HUNDRED INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED MICHAEL ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I WE TO HAVE SEEN EXPONENTIAL INCREASES IN OUR LICENSING FEES SINCE -- TWENTY FOURTEEN WELL WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE NEW LEADERSHIP AT THE DEPARTMENT I'M VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE PROJECTS AND THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS UNDERSTAND THEM THE IMPLICATIONS OF OF THE FEE INCREASES AND HOW THEY CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON REVENUE FOR FACILITIES -- FOR US ARE -- FEES WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER BED BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN A FOR AN LA COUNTY FACILITY WHAT'S PROPOSED STARTING IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WILL BE A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BED. SO THAT'S OVER 3100% INCREASE IN OF A LICENSING FEE PER BED FOR OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SO IT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT. AGAIN WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED A PROJECTS GOING FORWARD BUT WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NO AND CAN KEEP A HANDLE ON IMPROVEMENTS AND WHERE OUR LICENSING FEES ARE ACTUALLY BEING USED FOR SO THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] COMMENTS QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO COMMENT THAT I'M SHOCKED THAT THE THE INCREASES AND YOU KNOW WITH THE HEALTHCARE COST GOING UP THAT OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO BE PASSED DOWN TO THE CONSUMER WHICH A LOT OF TIMES IT'S ALSO ARE MEDICAL PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW UNTIL THE FEES FOR HEALTH CARE. GOING UP AND HOW DO WE BALANCE THAT IT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION. AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. MR ALMOST CIRCULAR CHAIR ON THE SAME NOTE I KNOW THAT -- INLAND EMPIRE ARE ARIANS AMBER DO YOU KNOW. WE HAVE A LARGE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY -- IN OUR AREA SO IT'S A VERY -- INTERESTING TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO BALANCE THAT OUT AS FAR AS THE HEALTH CARE IN THE COSTS THAT CONTINUE TO THE ONE THAT. SEES THE THE THE BRUNT OF THOSE INCREASES THAT ARE THERE. I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE'D BE SOME MORE -- DIALOGUE OR SOME MORE DISCUSSION ON THAT DATA BEING DRIVEN -- I KNOW WE HAD ANOTHER PRESENTATION AND ANOTHER COMMITTEE. SOMEWHERE THAT TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT RATES IN DIFFERENT STUDIES SOME BASED ON THE POPULATION THAT SERVING IN THOSE AREAS -- LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING SOME MORE THAT DIALOGUE AS FAR AS HOW WE'RE COMING UP WITH THE THE INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AND MAYBE EVEN SOME. SOME DATA FROM HISTORICAL AS FAR AS WHERE WE WERE AT TO WHERE WE ARE NOW. AND DO WE SEE WERE HAD IT BEEN AND SOME OF THESE COSTS ARE MOVING FORWARD SO IT REMAINS A AN AREA THAT I'D BE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. THANK YOU STROKES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YES. I ECHO OTHER A LOT OF THE SAME CONCERNS IT'S NO EVERY YEAR I GET ANOTHER CLINIC OR ANOTHER HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING GOING ON WHERE. THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO STAY OPEN AND AT I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THIS LOOKING AT TO INCREASE FEES ON THEM -- ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. BECAUSE MY TURN AROUND A THAT IS YOU KNOW WE AND ACCESS FOR ALL AND WE NEED. MORE HOSPITALS AND MORE CLINICS. AND ALL OF THESE THINGS BUT THEN YOU GET INTO THE WEEDS ON A AND YOU KNOW YOU FIND OUT A LOT OF OUR CLINICS OR OR WAITING FOR REIMBURSEMENTS AND IT TAKES A YEAR [inaudible] OR LONGER. TO GET THE FUNDING BACK SO THEY HAVE THE FRONT FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR [inaudible] AND EIGHT NOW YOU GUYS ARE ASKING FOR MORE FROM ALL. AND AND THAT MORE OR IS IT JUST GONNA COME FROM THEM BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO COME FROM. YOU KNOW OUR FAMILIES. WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO AFFORD CALIFORNIA? YOU KNOW YOU GET 24% OF OUR PEOPLE AND POVERTY. AND IT TAKES FROM THREE TO FOUR WEEKS TO GET IN TO SEE A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA AS MAKE IT HARDER TO KEEP THOSE FACILITIES OPEN IT JUST REALLY. MAKES ME QUESTION WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT BECAUSE A A WHAT WAS SAID BY THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WERE NOT SEEN A GOOD ARE A WHY. WITH WHAT YOU ALL OF BEEN GETTING. IS EVERY YEAR THERE'S MORE AND MORE FUNDING GOING TO YOUR AGENCY [inaudible] BUT YET. WHAT WE'RE GETTING BACK? IS THE SAME HEADACHE WE'VE BEEN GETTING BACK AND IN ITS THINGS ARE SLOW TO COME BACK. IN IN YOU GUYS ARE GREAT WORKING WITH MY OFFICE I KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE HAVE AN ENTIRE SAY WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF WE HAVE MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF FAMILIES THAT NEED HELP. AND WE'VE GOT A SEE BETTER RETURN ON INVESTMENT. AND AND THAT'S MY BIGGEST. CONCERN ON ALL OF THIS BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WE'RE GETTING ON THE OTHER END [inaudible] IS [inaudible] IT'S HURTING. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING. THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT ON THE SIDE FROM THE STATE AGENCY FROM YOU FOLKS SO HOW HOW IS THAT GOING TO BALANCE OUT AND WHY SHOULD WE GIVE THAT TO YOU. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE PAST HISTORY. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PART OF THESE FEE INCREASES ARE TO RIGHT SIZE THE SHIP IN THE SENSE THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL YEARS WERE. FEES WERE EITHER DECREASED OR STABILIZE WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GROWING WHICH THEN. THEREFORE THEN WE'RE TRYING TO RIGHT SIZE EIGHT YEARS LATER WHICH CAUSES THESE THESE HUGE INCREASES. AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS AS WELL AS AS FAR AS IN THE PAST YOU KNOW. THIS CHANGE TRANSFORMATION OF A LARGE DECENTRALISED AGENCY TROUGHOUT THE STATE IT TAKES TIME TO HAVE THAT KIND OF TRANSPORTATION ROUTE TRANSFORMATION BUT THERE DO YOU NEED TO BE RESULTS AND ESPECIALLY THIS NEXT YEAR WE KNEW DEAN IT NEXT YEAR WHEN I SHOW UP HERE. THERE NEEDS TO BE DEFINITE R. O. I. I KNOW ON THE TABLE THAT NEEDS TO BE SHOWN THAT IS WORKERS VERY RELEVANT ON WERE VERY WELL AWARE OF THOSE SPECIFIC RESULTS WE'RE LOOKING AT AS FAR AS COMPLAINT BACKLOGS. AS FAR AS OUR TIME TO PROCESS THEIR APPLICATIONS AND AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT OUR SURVEYORS ARE REACHING EVERY FACILITY -- AND GIVING ADEQUATE EFFICIENT -- HELPFUL INFORMATION BACK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HIGH QUALITY AND SAFETY AT ALL OF OUR FACILITIES THAT'S OUR GOAL HERE IS THAT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME COMMON GOALS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF US. WHETHER BE FAMILY MEMBERS OURSELVES WE'RE ALL PATIENTS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE IN SAFE HIGH QUALITY FACILITIES. WELL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE THERE THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US UP HERE ON THE DíAS THAT HAVE BEEN SITTING IN THE SEATS FOR YEARS NOW. AND WE'VE HEARD THESE THINGS BEFORE [inaudible] AND WE DON'T SEE DIFFERENT RESULTS FROM THE AGENCY REGARDLESS OF WHO THE NEW DIRECTORS ARE THE NEW HEADS ARE. AND IT'S FRUSTRATING. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. IF. THERE'S A MISTAKE MADE IT ON THE AGENCIES PART. THEN ONE OF OUR CLINICS IS GONNA BE PAYING BACK WITH INTEREST. TO THE AGENCY FOR THAT MISTAKE BY. IT DOESN'T WORK THE OTHER WAY AROUND. SO THEY KEEP PAIN IN PAIN IN PAIN FOR ANY MISTAKES MADE BY THE AGENCY WITH INTEREST. AND ARE WE WE GET THE LIP SERVICE AND WE APPRECIATE IT AND LOOK FORWARD TO IT MOVING FORWARD. TO TO THOSE REAL CHANGES AND WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE POLICY SIDE. BUT SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE YEAH AND AND JUST SAYING NO OKAY WERE WORKING ON IT THAT THAT'S GREAT. BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT AND THE I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE DEEP DIVE THAT WE ARE DOING IN CH ACU HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. I DON'T KNOW EVEN TOLD BY PREVIOUS DIRECTORS BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS QUITE RADICAL AND I'M NOT USING A CONSULTANT TO COME IN AND THEN FIX IT FOR US. I'M USING A GRASSROOTS EFFORT OF PROCESS CHANGE MANAGEMENT WE ARE DOING WORK STREAMS PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT HIRING -- DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPERTS WITHIN OURSELVES TO BE ABLE TO RIGHT SIZE BECAUSE THIS IS SO CRITICAL AM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SUCH A LONG STANDING ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD THE LIP SERVICE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CANDID COMMENTS BECAUSE WE DO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. THANK YOU ANY TIME TO STOP BY THE HAPPY TO THE SCORES THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS I THINK THAT AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWENTY EIGHT TOWARDS THE STAKEHOLDERS RESPONSE. JUST AS WAS NOTED THEY THEY UNDERSTAND THERE'S GOING TO BE A FEE INCREASE. CONCERNS REFLECT THE STEADY INCREASES OVER THE PAST MANY YEARS COUPLED WITH ALLEGE THAT LACK OF PROGRESS ON PROVIDING MORE TIMELY SERVICE. AND I I DO HOPE AS MR MATHIS HAS INDICATED IN MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. THAT TO AND NEXT YEAR THAT WE WILL HEAR NO MORE FEE INCREASES. AND THE BACKLOG HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF AND I THINK THEY WILL KNOW THAT. IT WAS DONE TO RIGHT THE SHIP -- BECAUSE THAT BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A BACKLOG BEFORE THEY WERE SUCH A PROBLEM BEFORE. I THINK THAT THE COMMENTS THAT ARE MADE. WHAT I'M HEARING IS? IT'S OKAY DO YOUR FEE INCREASE SO LONG AS WE'RE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS BACKLOG. BUT DON'T DO THE FEE INCREASE IF IN THE END WE'RE STILL HAVE TE BACKLOG AND THE SERVICE IS NOT BE PROVIDED. BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MORE COMMON -- MANAGER OR AND TO ADD ON TO THE DIALOGUE THERE ARE -- SUBSTANTIATE THAT THE RATE INCREASES THAT ALREADY HAVE BEEN. INCREASED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
