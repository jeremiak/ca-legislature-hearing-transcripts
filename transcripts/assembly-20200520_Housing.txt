SEVEN I AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH. ITEM TWELVE AB TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY TWO MULLIN. ITEM FIFTEEN AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY EIGHT KANSEN CHU. AND ITEM TWENTY AB NINETEEN OH FIVE WHICH IS MINE DAVID CHIU. SO WITH THAT I THINK WE HAVE OUR FIRST BILL AUTHORED ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AB TWENTY FOUR OH SIX FILE ITEM ONE WELCOME. ASSEMBLY WOMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THANK YOU REALLY BE HERE TODAY. YOU KNOW I ASSUME THIS WILL BE SAID QUITE A BIT THIS COMMITTEES TODAY BUT- IF NEEDS BE UNDERSCORED THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO FACE IN TERMS OF OUR- IN CRISIS AND ARE THE STATE FACED WITH GIVEN THE COVER NINETEEN ECONOMIC FALL OUT. PART OF THE SOLUTION THERE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RESOURCES FROM THE STATE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE FORM OF FINANCIAL AID FOR LANDLORDS AND TENANTS WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT. THE WITH EIGHT ALSO BECOME ALSO CRITICAL AS ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. AND THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE AN ONLINE PORTAL THAT WILL COLLECT RENTAL DOT INFORMATION. AB TWENTY FOUR SIX FOR LANDLORDS TO REGISTER. IF THEY ARE ACCEPTING STATE OR FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE A RESPONSE TO COVER NINETEEN WHICH I BELIEVE IS A REASONABLE ASK OF LANDLORDS. LANDLORDS SAVING THESE RESOURCES- TENANTS- MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS- AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WILL ALSO BE ALLOWED TO VOLUNTARY SUBMIT THE DATA SHOULD THEY SO CHOOSE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL TO WRITE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR LENDERS RECEIVING RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND PREVENTING RESIDENTS FROM EXPERIENCING HOW DO TO COVER NINETEEN. THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE'S LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE AS WELL AS MYSELF- IN TERMS OF PROVIDING THAT RENTAL ASSISTANCE. HOWEVER AB TWENTY FOUR SIX IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW BILLS HOLDING LIMITS ACCOUNTABLE FOR RECEIVING. SUCH A SYSTEM. REQUIRING LENS PLAY TO SUBMIT BASIC RENTAL DATA INFORMATION IS NOT TIME CONSUMING. FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF LA'S RENTAL REGISTRY IS TWO PAGES. TAKES AT MOST MAYBE TEN MINUTES. I APPRECIATE THIS QUESTION AMONG MY COLLEAGUES AND ADVOCATES INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT CESSATION CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND THIS BILL. IN ITS CURRENT FORM FRANKLY NEEDS MORE WORK AND- I HAD EARLIER VERSION OF THIS BILL WHICH WE BASICALLY GOT IT- THINKING THROUGH WHAT'S ACTUALLY THAN THIS MOMENT IN TIME GIVEN THE ECONOMIC SITUATION THAT WE'RE FACED WITH. AND WANT TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL BUT HOW WE APPROACH OUR POLICIES WERE GIVEN OUR CURRENT REALITY SO THERE WILL BE CHANGES TO THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD FOR EXAMPLE. GET PLACER TWENTY. TO THE- THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. WE'RE ALSO POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT HOUSING THIS ONLINE PORTAL THROUGH- U. S. C. OR C. S. YOU- RESEARCH BASE ENTITY HOUSING THIS PORTAL AND ON GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY WILL REDUCE. THE COST WILL ALSO I CAN IMPORT ELEMENT TO FIGURE OUT. HERE GIVEN ARE ON BUDGET SITUATION. HI AND AS I SAID IT'S STILL WORK IN PROGRESS I THINK IT'S CRITICAL HAVING SOME LIGHT IN TRANSPARENCY OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT- IS IT IS GOING TO BE KEY AS WE THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY OF COVERT NINETEEN AND I WOULD FOR THESE REASONS THAT AB TWENTY FOUR SIX MOVE FOR TODAY IN ORDER TO ALLOW DISCUSSIONS TAKE. TEST THE PORT IS. EVE FROM TECH EQUITY. AND MARK STIVERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS- I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I'M GONNA ASK MODERATOR TO CONNECT US FIRST WITH THE FIRST WITNESS AND THAT IS- IT IAN EVE PERRY FROM TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE.

ABLE OPERATE AND MAKE A PROFIT ON YOUR YOU ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE YOUR BUSINESS HAVE MAKE MONEY FOR YOU THAT LEAVES THE ONLY REAL OPTION IN ORDER THE CLOSURE PARK AS BANKRUPTCY.

WE SHARE THE GOALS AND THE AIMS OF THE BILL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION- WITH THE AUTHORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME ASK IF SURE REPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA. VERSION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS ON THE LINE MISTER MODERATOR. YES HI- ACCUSED CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M SURE REPORT WITH CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING GOOD AFTERNOON CSA TO THE NATIONAL NONPROFIT WORKING TO FALL HOMELESSNESS AND LEAVE MY RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY AND LATIN AND- IN THE PAST THE LEGISLATURE HAS TREATED EXEMPTION FOR. STREAMLINING AS AN INCENTIVE TO ACHIEVE A STRONG PUBLIC GOOD AND WE SEE THIS BILL IN AND ATTENDED- DEPARTURE FROM THIS POLICY CURRENTLY THE STATE AND MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING TOWARD PLACING THE- BORN IN SIX. AND MOTEL TO SAFEGUARD THESE A FROM COVETING THIS POLICY HAVE THE GOAL OF ACQUIRING MANY OF IS NOT COME INTO TERM HOUSING. AB TWO FIVE EIGHT WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR DEVELOPERS ACROSS THE STATE TO PURCHASE THESE MOTELS POTENTIALLY DRIVING UP COSTS. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BILL I COULD RESULT IN PLACEMENT OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS WERE SHELTERING IN MOTELS BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN ABILITY TO COPE IT. EXIT THIS PLACE THOUSANDS MORE WHO LIVE IN MOTELS BECAUSE THEY ARE HOMELESS OR WHO CAN'T GET INTO HOUSING IN THE PRIVATE MARKET BECAUSE OF POOR CREDIT OR FIX OUR PATH JEFF. THE REASON AMENDMENTS HAVING A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHERE DEVELOPERS COULD BE BUILDING HOUSING FOR SIXTY TO EIGHTY- SIXTY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT- A IN MY AREA MEDIAN INCOME. WOULD RESULT IN DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO ARE ABOUT THE LOW INCOME THRESHOLD. UNFORTUNATELY AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY CURRENTLY DOES NOTHING TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. EVEN RECENT AMENDMENTS ARE UNLIKELY TO PROTECT PEOPLE CURRENTLY RESIDING IN THE IT'S NOT SPELLED. AS MOST CURRENT RESIDENTS ARE WELL BELOW THE INCOME LEVEL AND DEVELOPERS COULD DISPLACED RESIDENTS OPPOSE BOTH EVEN COME AT THAT ARE BELOW THESE INCOME LEVEL. TO CONVERT HOUSE. THERE ARE NO KERN PROTECTIONS THE BILL. I PREFER THE ADDRESS. WE HOPE TO COME TO WORK WITH THE SAN MEMBER STAFF ON AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY TWO AND NOT ALL OF THE TWO EXCEPTIONS THE LAST. NAME LINE THE CONVERSION MOTELS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING ARE AT RISK OF. AND REQUESTED THE FALL ON MEN AND- WOMEN THE STREAMLINED MINISTER VIEW TOO MUCH TALKING FOR. AND WHICH HUNG PERCENT OF THE UNITS ARE FOR BOTH LOWER INCOME. AND A SICKENING PORTION OF THE UNITS ARE AFFORDABLE TO THE HOUSEHOLD EXPERIENCING OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. REQUIRE THAT ANY EXISTING RESIDENT WE THE LOCATION OF THE SPENT DURING THE REHABILITATION PROCESS AND IS OFFERED A RIGHT TO RETURN TO THE PERMANENT UNIT EVENT TAKE FOR. THE AMENDMENTS WOULD CHANGE THE BILL TO ACHIEVE THE STRONG PUBLIC GOOD THAT IT'S BEEN TYPICAL OF- FROM THE PATH. LISTEN LEARN CAN'T. WITHOUT THESE AMENDMENTS AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY WOULDN'T CHEAT THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE COULD BUY TO STRESS MOTELS AT A LOWER COST BY DRIVING MORE COMPETITION FOR THE PROPERTY. IT WOULD FURTHER DISPLACED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE AN ART RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. AND FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU.

THE TWO CHAIR MEMBER TERAFLOPS IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT GETTING A LETTER IN IN TIME WE STAND WITH THE BUILDING TRADES AND IN OPPOSITION AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTHOR IS WORKING TO WORK OUT AMENDMENT AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT. THANK YOU. NO NOW IN THE QUEUE AT THIS PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. IT THIS TIME LET US BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. MISS QUIRK SILVA. ONE OF PSYC THANK THE OFFER OF FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND- TO ALL OF OUR BUILDING TRADE HONORABLE FRIENDS THAT TIME WE ARE ALWAYS HAPPY TO SUPPORT. THE CRITICAL FACTOR THAT MAKES ME MOVE TOWARDS SUPPORTING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. IS SIMPLY WE ALREADY HAD A HOUSING CRISIS BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT HOMES AND WE CAN EXPECT EVEN MORE AFTER WE GET BACK TO SOME KIND OF NORMALCY AND AS MUCH AS- WE MIGHT. TO GET BUILDING HOUSING WE SIMPLY DO WE KNOW IT'S TAKING THREE FOUR YEAR AND- ANY PROJECTS OFF THE GROUND. AND WE ALSO HAVE MANY PEOPLE EVEN IF THE PROJECT GETS TO THE CITY- WHERE THEY OPPOSE IT. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT USING MOTELS AND HOTELS THERE ALREADY AS WAS STATED- EXISTING MOTELS AND HOTELS THAT ARE BEING USED FOR. LOW INCOME FAMILIES. OR INDIVIDUALS AND SOME OF THEM ARE OPERATING THIS WAY AS WELL WHAT. THE CONVERSION OF THESE HOTELS CERTAINLY- AND I DO ASK THE MEMBER BRINGING THE LEGISLATION FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE TRADES. BUT WE KNOW THAT IF WE DO NOTHING. WE DO NOT THE WE HAVE THE EXPECTATION THAT NOT ONLY WILL THINGS GET WORSE WHAT WE KNOW THEY WILL IN FACT AND ALL THE MEMBERS IN THE TRADES AND OTHERS WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT YOUR VERY OWN COMMUNITIES YOUR LIVING IN AND ASK YOURSELF HAS HOMELESSNESS INCREASED. WHETHER IT BE FOR VETERANS WHETHER IT BE FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN FAMILIES INDIVIDUAL. AND IS THAT IT. ALL OF DO IS WALK OUT THIS IS GREAT BUILDING HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND WE HAVE PEOPLE LIVING LITERALLY ON THE CAMPUS OF THIS GREAT BUILDING THE CAPITAL OF SACRAMENTO. WE WALKED TWO TO THREE BLOCKS AWAY AND WE SEE PEOPLE NOT ONLY LIVING ON THE STREETS BUT LINE ON CURBS WITH LITTLE POP UP TENTS. IT'S ABSOLUTELY ACCEPTABLE WE HAVE TO WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION AND EVERY TIME WE SAY NO THEY'RE ALREADY BEEN. TOLD COMMITTEE WITH. EVEN FURTHER EXPENSES GO UP AND PRETTY SOON WE BEAT THEM YOU TO. WHAT I WE HAVE OUR- AND WE ARE I SO I CERTAINLY ON OUR ONLY SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I'M IT SO AND I ASKED OF US TOGETHER INCLUDING. A HIGH VALUED BUILDING TRADES TO WORK WITH US TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS. SO THERE'S BEEN A MOTION WITH THIS FOR IS OUR SECOND. MISTER GORE'S SECOND AND OTHER COMMENTS MISTER GORE. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE IN THE BILL AUTHORED I WANT TO UNDERSTAND OF BECAUSE IT WAS MY IDEA WAS REPRESENTATIVE MY STAFF- THAT THEY HAD BEEN CHANGED POSITION- FROM THE BUILDING TRADES- ON THIS TICKET AND I HEARD THE TESTIMONY ST IF MANDATE. YOU KNOW IT IS OFTEN. I HAVE JUST AS MEMBERS TO HAVE BUT CAN THAT IS A MEMBER MAKING YOU TO. A PERHAPS THE- LEADING GOOD INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN HAS CERTAINLY SET IN AN NOT AND THINK YOU YES A THE TROOPS COMMUNICATED WITH US YESTERDAY THAT THE APPRECIATED. ALL THE WORK WE PUT INTO IT AND THEY WILL NOT BE OPPOSING NOT BE OPPOSING TOMORROW COMPETE. BOTH THE CABBIE OUT NEED TO KEEP WORK SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN NOW YES YOU. WAS THAT. CAN ALL OF US. AND TODAY BUT ALSO I LIKE TO SPEAK A LITTLE TO. WHAT WHAT THIS BILL IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT SO WHEN WE STARTED WITH THIS BILL- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST BILLS WE INTRODUCED THIS YEAR AND LIKE ME MEMBERS WE HAVE THE MOST BILLS WITH THOSE THAT WE THINK ARE EX COVERAGE. SO I TO MIDDLE BILLS YOU DEALING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS RELATES NOT OFTENTIMES TO HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE STREETS AND THEN THIS HOUSING ONE WHICH THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IT'S- PEOPLE. ALIVE BUT THEY- PLACE FOR THE TO. SO IN. SOME OF THE- LOW LOW INCOME THE SPEAKING ABOUT THIS PEOPLE I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT WHAT DONE IN HERE THAT OF A MOTEL OR HOTEL. FOR SIX MONTHS IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO PLACES USING PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. CAN BE USED SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SB CERTIFIED THE HOTEL OR MOTEL. SO WE WENT JUST FROM THIS BEING A- YOU KNOW WITH WITH WITH NO LABOR PROTECTIONS TO AS WE BEGAN TO NEGOTIATE. A PREVAILING WAGE HER. AND LET ME ALSO SAY REMIND YOU AGAIN THAT WE AVE DONE FIRST WE HAD 20% AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE GOT UP TO. FIFTEEN WITH 5% GOING TO LOW LOW INCOME HOUSING AND THEN WE WERE ASKED TO PUT IN SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. SO WE TOOK THAT AMENDMENT AS WELL SO THAT'S ALSO BEEN THERE FOR THESE PROJECTS. HOW 2% SKILLED AND TRAINED PREVAILING WAGE. WE SAID THE ONLY CAVEAT WOULD BE IF SOMEONE WANTED TO DO THAT SPOKE TO SOME OF THE OTHER- OPPOSITION. A 100% AFFORDABLE LOW INCOME HOUSING. THEN IT WAS STILL THE PREVAILING WAGE BUT THE NOT SKILLED AND TRAINED JUST BECAUSE OF THE CAR WE HAVE ALL TALKED ABOUT. ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING HOUSING AND JOB. AND THEN. BASE COST WITH DEALING WITH- VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING. SO WE FEEL LIKE THAT'S A PLACE AS A GOOD PLACE TO LAND AND I GUESS AS MEMBERS WE GET TO THE- RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE THE CALIFORNIA. TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WE HAVE ELECTED TO DO THAT AND WE GET TO VOTE ON WHAT WE THINK IS PUBLIC POLICY. WHEN SOMETIMES THAT MEANS SAYING NO TO OUR FRIENDS AND IF WE CAN'T SAY NO TO OUR FRIENDS SOMETIMES FOR THE ETTERMENT OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. OF WHAT WE THINK IS GOOD. POLICY THEN WE DON'T AND THAT'S TOO BAD FOR CALIFORNIA BUT I BELIEVE MEMBERS I BELIEVE THAT E ALL HAVE THE COURAGE AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL CAN SEE WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS NOW FIND WAYS TO BE RICH PEOPLE AND ME SURE WILL HAVE GOOD PAYING JOBS. BUT THAT PLACE TO LIVE. YOU WILL I GREW UP. WE HELD OUR NAY. WHAT I DRIVE MY CAR NOW WITH MY ELEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND I SEE PEOPLE LAYING ON THE STREET. DO I TELL HER TO TURN HER HEAD. TOWARDS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN'T HELP THOSE WHO NEED THE MOST HELP. I TALKED TO HARD TO STAND UP. OR DO I SAY. YEAH WE DO OUR BEST TO HELP PEOPLE EVERYDAY THROUGH NON PROFITS IN THE WORK WE DO. AND YOUR MOM. TO PASS LAWS. TO PROVIDE A PATH FOR DIGNITY FOR ALL PEOPLE. NO THAT MEMBERS I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR IBM. YEAH I WAS. OKAY COMMAS I WAS QUITE DONE BUT I APPRECIATE EXPLAINS HOW WE COME HERE TODAY AND I BILL YOU LOVE TO KNOW I KNOW THE MANY OF THE OPPONENTS WHO SPOKE TODAY TO RECOGNIZE IT'S PROBABLY WORTH ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION. AND SO I THINK IN THAT SPIRIT WE SHOULD CONTAIN WORK ON THE CHECK MY CALL. HOTEL CONVERSION IN SANTEE TO INCREASE OUR SUBSET PERMANENTLY OF- RETAINED. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY QUITE HONESTLY. WITH THE CONVERSION PARKS CONVENTION CENTER IN SAN DIEGO INTO A TWELVE HUNDRED PERSON HOMELESS SHELTER. WE DO NOT HAVE THIS PARTICULAR- IN THE TOWARD POSSIBILITY AB BEER FOR THE END OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO SHOW THESE ARE SHELTERED INDIVIDUALS THE DOOR IS SHUT FOR THE BACK ON THE STREET SO. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS. TO REPRESENT WHO'S CURRENTLY LIVING THERE ALTHOUGH I PASSED PARCELLS WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE FAMILIES LIVING IN MOTELS. ON THAT DATE THE DAILY RATE TENDENCY WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY YOU DON'T HAVE TIME HOMELESS RIGHT. IN OFF THE DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS I WOULD NOTE THAT IT'S MY LOCAL HOUSING COMMISSION IS TRYING TO A PART. PROPERTY THAT WOULD DISCOVERY IS THERE TO SUPPORT. THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT WORTHY OF PUBLIC IN. BECAUSE THEY NOT GONNA CONDITION THAT THE KIND THAT WE BY OPPOSING THIS LEGISLATION ARE COMPLICIT SEEMINGLY TO. ENDORSING WHICH I DIDN'T ALONG THE LINES OF YOUR SAME AS AN ANTI WITH TWO DAUGHTERS. ABOUT WHAT KIND OF STATE YOU LIVE IN SO. MY POINT IS THIS. I'M NOT HOW THE COMMISSION. THIS IS THE CHEAPEST PER DOOR WAIT DON'T PER DOOR RATE I KNOW OF TO GET MORE FOR THE HOUSING STOCK ON TO THE ROLES. AND I RECOGNIZE THIS ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE MEANS A MAYES PROPERTIES ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. AND TO THE EXTENT YOU ARE WORKING TO CRAFT A SITUATION WHERE THESE WILL NOT BE COVERED UP BY. A REAL ESTATE CONFIRMS BUT INSTEAD CAN BE PURCHASED FOR THE INCREASE FOR TO GROW OUR HOUSING. HOUSING STARTS I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION WITH THE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION IT IS CERTAINLY COMPLICATED. OUR OFFICE IS SCHEDULED THIS YEAR NON BUT BELIEVE IN YOUR- LEGISLATOR I BELIEVE IN THE OPPONENTS BOTH CARE DEEPLY ABOUT WHAT WHAT. DOES IT CARE ABOUT THE- DOCTOR. THE STATE. WITH THE BECAUSE THE DEMAND OF A SUB THANK YOU. TO THAT FOR THE VISION TIME HAPPY SUPPORT THE- ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I WANT TO THANK AUTHOR FOR YOUR WORK HERE IN YOU KNOW LET ME SAY STATE THE OBWHICH IS ARE LIVE IN ON PRESS TIMES AND WE ARE TO THINK HARD AND IN FOR NEW IDEAS AND WE HOUSE. OF CALIFORNIA'S ARE AND THIS IDEA OF THE HOUSE INDIVIDUALS AND CONVERTED HOTELS HOTEL ROOMS IS FRANKLY CENTRAL TO OURS. POINT ARE AND HOW WE ARE DRESSING NOT JUST HOMELESSNESS BUT CRIME VIRUS- THROUGH PROJECT ROOM KEY AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE CONVERSIONS DON'T GET DOWN AND- THE PROCESS OR NEED THE GROUP'S ARE THAT ONE OF. HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ON HAVE VISUAL. ONCE YOU KNOW I EVERYONE ON THIS DíAS WE ARE INCREDIBLY SUPPORT. OF THE WORK AND THAT- THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR TRADE BUILDING TRADES TO. I DO THINK THERE HAVE BEEN THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION ABOUT DAYS I JUST WANNA AGAIN CLARIFY WHAT. ABOUT MS AT. AGREED TO ACCEPT THE MEMBER. TO ENSURE THE PREVAILING WAGE WILL APPLY TO ALL PROJECTS AND TO ASSURE THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A PROJECTS- DEVELOPERS- WHO WISH TO TURN TRULY VACANT HOTELS INTO MULTI FAMILY HOUSING- WITHIN I'M PRESS LEVEL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'LL DO THAT UTILIZING A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. ARE SKILLED TRAINED WORK PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL HI AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE STANDARD- THAT WE'VE HAD FOR- YOU FOR YEARS- REALLY BASED ON THE IDEA THAT- THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE BALANCES WERE TRYING TO TREAT THIS HOUSING SO ARE WANT TO SAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW NUMBER OF COLOR TO PASS ME SINCE THERE TO AND SOME CAN. DO YOU HAVE NOW FOR. TRADE PROVIDE TO MY STAFF THAT THAT THEY WERE NOT BE OPPOSING IN COMMITTEE TODAY BUT AGAIN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING- WITH THE CABINET THAT HAS EXPRESSED AT THAT THEY WOULD KEEP WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS LINGERING CONCERNS AND I TRUST THAT YOU WILL DO THAT SO. I KNOW THIS IS A- THAT WITH THE WITH CHALLENGES APPRECIATE- OF THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING IMMINENT SAID WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S THOUGHTFUL INPUT- I AM COMMITTED AS A SURE THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FOR WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE HELP THOUSANDS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE- QUICKLY- AND PERMANENTLY RECEIVE HOUSING WHICH IS WHY I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. SO WITH THAT. UNLESS THERE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS.

SOME LOCAL CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA PLACE RESTRICTIONS OR PRECONDITIONS ON RESPONDING TO TENANTS HABITABILITY COMPLAINTS FOR EXAMPLE SOME PLACES WILL REQUIRE TENANTS TO PROVE THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER HAS BEEN UNRESPONSIVE TO THEIR COMPLAINTS OR THAT THE TENNIS CIRCLE ON THE RAMP FOR THE LOCAL AGENCY WILL SEND OUT AN IT FACTOR. NONE OF THE SHOULD MATTER LOCAL GOVERNMENT. POST TO ENSURE THAT ALL DWELLING UNITS ARE HABITABLE OR FREE OF LEAD PAINT. AB THIRTY THREE FIFTY TWO PROHIBITS LOCAL CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA FROM PLACING RESTRICTIONS OR PRECONDITIONS. BEFORE RESPONDING TO HABITABILITY COMPLAINTS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE AGENCY PROVIDE COPIES OF THE INSPECTION REPORT ANY CITATIONS TO THE TENANT. THEIR OCCUPANTS OF THE BUILDING WHO MAY BE AFFECTED BECAUSE SOME LOCALITIES ATTENDED MY COMPLAINT. AND NEVER FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COMPLAINT AND WONDER IF THEY'RE LIVING IN AN UNSAFE CONDITION. OUTSIDE PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE REPORTED ANY INSPECTION AB THIRTY THREE FIFTY TWO DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW DUTIES OR RESPONSIBILITIES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

THE REPAIRS MADE THEM EAT BUT IT ALSO POTENTIALLY AMERICA'S- THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS OBLIGATION TO REPAIR IS ON ARE NOT ON THE TENNIS. AND THE P. OBLIGATION.

YOU KNOW WHEN HOUSING AT THE SAME- STANDARDS ON VERY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT- TIME I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THE ZONING ITSELF LEE. IT ALL. LAWS ARE BEING USED IN A WAY TO CREATE STATEWIDE PROBLEMS I THINK THAT THAT ADMITS OF A YOU KNOW YEAH REVISITING THE STATE LAW AND THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE WITH WITH WITH ZONING IN IN SOME SORT. OF THEIR- I. IN ORDER THE NATIONAL HOUSING HAVE IN THIS SO YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INTERESTING SOLUTION HERE I PERSONALLY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED IT IT DIDN'T YOU IS THAT. CHINA INCLUSIONARY.

HIGHER AND BELIEVE YOU. I WOULD BE. FOR US TO HAVE THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE. EVERY POSSIBLE. BUT I THINK WE- A BIT UNREALISTIC GIVEN FIND UNLESS HAVE. A BILLING OF DOLLARS THAT WE CAN USE TO HELP SUBSIDIZE THIS I KNOW EVEN IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO- WE'VE DONE ECONOMIC STUDIES BY ALL. BY ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THIS CONVERSATION AND 20% TO. IS A VERY HIGH THRESHOLD SO UNLESS THERE ARE. IS AND SO THIS I THIS IS TOUGH COME. I THINK CERTAIN DURING THIS TIME OF CORONAVIRUS WHEN WE KNOW HOW MANY EMPTY STOREFRONTS AND COMMERCIAL YEARS ARE GONNA BE CHALLENGED IT IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR US TO TAKE A MOMENT SAY. IT MAKES SENSE. THIS IS PROPERTY OWNERS CAN'T MAKE IT THE COMMERCIAL AND FOR US TO CONVERT THAT TO HOUSING. SO AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT.

IT'S ONE TO THINK YOU WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF EVERYBODY HAPPY TO MERGE THESE BILLS AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I. AS FOR. THE MOTION AND SECOND MADAM SECRETARY. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED Q. HI JILL I DEEP. GABRIEL HI GABRIEL I'D GLORIA KILEY KILEY IDLY MOM MAIENSCHEIN QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES ON CALL IS ON CALL THANK YOU. WHEN WE GO TO IF FOR A SCRIPT SO IF YOU'RE READY FOR FILE ITEM THIRTEEN AB TWENTY NINE FIVE. IF YOU WANT TO PLEASE PROCEED AND I'M JUST GONNA TALK TO THE BACK TO TRY TO EAT A SANDWICH IN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND AS WE HAVE. MEMBERS COMING IN AND OUT I ANY. STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU- HEAR THE TESTIMONY ABOUT AB TWENTY. EIGHT NINETY FIVE. AS WE'VE HEARD MANY MANY TIMES TODAY IN OUR HEARING. A HOUSING IS AN SHORTAGE. WE HAVE A HOMELESS CRISIS. AND WE ARE INDEPENDENT AND THE THAT A PANDEMIC. UP WHICH- MEANS THERE ARE ESTIMATES. UP TO TWO. THAT FALLING INTO HOMELESS. SO AS WE THAT SEEN AND AS WE LOOK AT THIS COMMITTEE IT'S A VERY VERY SERIOUS COMMITTEE THAT DEALT WE NEED TO MAKE EVERY ATTEMPT TO MOVE HOUSING INITIATIVES FORWARD. AT THE SHORE WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HERS HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED RENT INCREASES AT UNPRECEDENTED RATES. HOMEOWNERSHIP HAS BECOME. UNATTAINABLE FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS AND WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS FOR ALSO TALKING ABOUT OUR MILLENNIALS ARE ADULT CHILDREN MOVING BACK HOME AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE MIDDLE CLASS STUDIES SHOW THAT 40% OF AMERICANS ARE ONE STEP AWAY FROM POVERTY. WE KNOW IN THIS PAN I'M AT THAT THAT TESTED THAT MANY OF OUR FELLOW. BIRDS AT FRIENDS HAVE USED EVERY BIT OF THEIR SAVINGS AND NOW ARE LOOKING AT POSSIBLE OF ACTIONS. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO NEVER IMAGINED THEM SELVES IN A SITUATION OF BEING HOUSING TO KEEP. ARE LOOKING AT THAT SAID. UNDEAD PANDEMIC THE HOUSING CRISIS AND HOMELESS ISSUES OF OUR STATE HAS GROWN WHEN FROM BEFORE COVETED NOW. ONE OF AN OPTIONS THAT MANY PEOPLE AS THEY LOOK TOWARDS RETIREMENT. INVESTED IN WERE MOBILE HOMES FOR THIS TODAY THERE HAVE BEEN TWO OTHER MOBILE HOME BILLS SO I CONSIDER THOSE UP ACTED YOUR MOBILE HOME BILLS. EXACTLY THE LOOK AT MOBILE HOME RENTERS AND MOBILE HOME OWNERS AND TO NOTE ACTS THE FACTS ARE THAT MOBILE HOMES. ARE NOT MOBILE THEY ARE MOBILE TO NOTE THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO USE OR CHOOSE TO LIVE IN A MOBILE HOME. OUR SENIORS ARE RETIRED AND EXPECTED THAT INVESTMENT TO BE. PART OF RETIREMENT AND TO BE ABLE TO RETIRE AND LIVE IN THE MOBILE HOMES THAT THEY CHOSE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED. EFFORT TO SELL MOBILE HOME PARKS AND TURN THOSE MOBILE HOME PARKS INTO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF HOUSING. AS WE LOOK AT THIS ONE QUOTE HUGE QUESTION TO ASK IS WHAT ABOUT THOSE SENIORS WHO HAVE INVESTED% IN THAT PROPERTY WHAT WOULD BE THEIR NEXT STEP. THIS SCENARIO DEVELOPED IN MY HOMETOWN FULLER TEN IN MY DISTRICT THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS SIXTY FIVE WHERE A MOBILE HOME PARK WAS SOLD AND WITH AND MONTHS OF SELLING THE- RESIDENT. READ IF THE TWENTY PERCENT. PAY INCREASE WHICH FOR MANY OF THEM- IS JUST KIND OF DOUBLE. WITH ANAHEIM TEN AS THE MOBILE HOME PARK STRETCHES BETWEEN THOSE TWO CITY BOTH CITIES DELIBERATED ABOUT POSSIBLE SUPPORT FOR MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS BUT IS IT TURNED OUT ANAHEIM CAME UP WITH NO SOLUTIONS FULLER TEN DID SOME LOW. OR A SHORT SUBSIDY FOR THESE MOBILE HOME RIGHT RENTERS BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ABLE TO HELP THE MOBILE HOME RENTERS RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THOSE FUNDS ARE RUNNING NOW. AND IT ALSO KEEPS THEM FROM HELPING OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE AND HOMELESS SITUATION GEN SO WHAT MY BILL DOES MY BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE EXPAND PROTECTION. AND RENT INCREASE IS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO OWN A MOLE. BUT RENT THE LAND AND THE THOUGHT HOME RESIDES ON AS- THE WHO RENT A MOLD HOME FROM A PART OWNER. THE RESIDENTS A RANCHO LOS. AS I JUST KNOW ALL OUR SOMEBODY THAT I KEEP IN MIND AS I KNOW MANY OF THESE PARK A RENTERS. WE HAVE MET THEY HAVE COME UP TO ME TO ASK FOR SUPPORT AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING. THEY ALL ARE WANTING TO LIVE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE FOUR YEAR OLD VETERAN LIVING IN THIS PARK AND THEY PLANNED ON RETIRING THERE AND NOT IS MY WHOLE BUT NOT JUST FOR FULLER TO ANAHEIM. BUT ACROSS THE STATE THAT WILL BE CAN. LOOK AT LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP PROTECT THEM- WE DO HAVE- SUPPORTERS ON THE PHONES ALL MOVE TOWARDS HEARING THEIR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE WE GO TO OUR- WITNESSES ON THE PHONE TO THE MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE ALLOW BRYAN ACOSTA WITH THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION OF SPEAK.

GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN A GUEST ON BEHALF OF THEIR CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. PLEASE DO. A SUPPORT THIS BILL- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DISCUSS- IT'S CRITICAL. THAT WE PROVIDE TO FOR. FOUR THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST. REMAINING SOURCES OF AFFORDABLE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA AND RATE INCREASES CAN BE DEVASTATING FOR MOBILE HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE- YOU CANNOT MOVE YOUR HOME INTO A NEW PARK CALIFORNIA AND SO IF THE RENT IS BASED OFF THEY SAID THEY DID. QUESTION THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD. TO TRY TO MAKE ESCALATING RENT PAYMENTS WHEN WE FACE THAT SITUATION WE OFTEN SEE FOLKS FACING WHAT WE CALL ECONOMIC EVICTION WHERE THEY EVENTUALLY ARE FORCED TO MOVE OUT NOW LOTS OF CITIES HAVE PROTECTED HOME THIS AND BY. RENT CONTROL. MANY CITIES AND NOT HAVE SO MANY HOMEOWNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE NOT PROTECTED BY ANY LIMITS ON GREECE'S. BEYOND WHAT AN ANNUAL LEASE MIGHT PROVIDE AND SO. THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE MAJORITY OF HOMEOWNERS ARE PROJECTED FROM UNREASONABLE RATE INCREASES WHILE ALSO PRESERVING THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO. PROTECT AT. NICOLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TOOL AND WE WOULD URGE AND I DON'T. IF WE CAN NOW GO TO THE NEXT WITNESS. IT TO THE MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE ALLOW LUPE RAMIREZ TO.

THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I THINK THE- THEY'RE BOTH IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM SO THE FIRST WITNESS IS ANDREW. YES THANK YOU CHAIR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS- ANDERSON MEMBER QUIRK SILVA- W. MAY RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES THIS BILL AS WE SAID BEFORE. MA'AM WRITTEN TENANTS ARE GOING TO COVER NINETEEN TOGETHER- LANDLORDS ARE JUST AS CONFUSED AS TENANTS WERE TRYING TO PAY OUR EMPLOYEES ARE. TO KEEP PARKS AND OBVIOUSLY THESE BILLS PUT PRESSURE ON OWNERS. WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE OPPOSE. HAVING THAT I RENT CONTROL MOBILE HOME CONTROL IS. THE RE BEING IF YOU PUT RENT CONTROL ON APARTMENT THERE'S JUST ONE FEE IT'S THE APARTMENT RENT BUT WHEN YOU PUT RENT CONTROL ON A MOBILE HOME WHAT YOU DO IS YOU DRIVE UP THE PRICE OF THE SALES. AND WE HAVE EXAMPLES THAT WE'VE- WE'VE NOTICED FOR INSTANCE WHAT LOW INCOME A MODERATE PERSON CAN AFFORD A SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOME IN OXNARD BY THE BEACH IN A RENT CONTROL JURISDICTION. THE IN CLOSE BY I WOULD BE QUE. IN YOUR- PLEASE THIS WILL HAVE A DRAMATIC. I GOT WHERE IF YOU SUPPRESS THE RENT AND YOU KEEP IT DOWN A LOW LEVEL SPECIAL VACANCY CONTROL ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS JACK UP THE PRICE OF THE HOME SALE AND WHAT BE THE CURRENT. YOU CAN READ CURRENT LIVING HOW DOES THAT HELP YOU WHAT ABOUT. IT DOESN'T WORK THE THAT IT'S PAID FOR. YES THE TO A IT. SO REALLY WHEN IT COMES RENT CONTROL FOR MOBILE HOMES YOU NEED TO HAVE A I DON'T TO VACATE THE TROUBLE. A LITTLE PRESSURE WHEN SOMEONE MOVES OUT AND THEN THAT WAY THE RENT CAN GO UP A LITTLE AND IT KEEPS THE HOME PRICES DOWN AS- A FACT. PROOF THAT ARE NOT. THEY CAP THE RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THE SAME OF THE SO THE HOME OF THE READ THE PARKING COULDN'T TO MY BUT NEITHER COULD THE RESIDENTS WHEN SURE THAT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW THAT WAS THROWN OUT BECAUSE SANTA DIDN'T FOR SALE OTHER RESIDENTS. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A NOVEL CONCEPT FIND BOUNCE FOR OWNERS SINCE IN THE STATE BACK BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DO RICH ONE GROUP OF AN EVENT. AT THE DETRIMENT OF BECAUSE TRYING TO COME AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THAT IF YOU PASS THIS BILL IF YOU PASS RENT CONTROL AND AGAIN WE UNDERSTAND. THE ARE YOU. IN MY- WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SET. UP I THINK THEY NEED TO BE MORE WORK DONE ON BILL PROVIDE ABOUT. OF RENT AND THEN FINALLY A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A PARK THAT'S BOT. YOU HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY THOSE TAXES GET PASSED ON TO RENT INCREASES IF THE STATE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH. THEM AND OWNERS TO SOMEHOW WORK WITH THEM SO WE DON'T HAVE TO PASS ON THIS TAXES AND RENT INCREASES YOU CAN WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS LEGISLATOR. SO IF IT ISN'T. STRICTLY A- WE- TURN OVER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AGAIN JASON ACT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE TO HANDLE ALL THE IT'S BEEN MY MISTER GOVERNOR ON BEHALF OF WMA. ADD THAT.

CAMERA I GLORIA ANY KILEY NOW WE MOM MANGE QUIRK. THAT BILL HAS SORRY. THE BILL HAS THREE VOTES IN ITS ON CALL GREAT THANK YOU. LET'S GO NOW TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS LINE ITEM SEVENTEEN AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY FIVE. MISTER CHAIR HOW ARE YA COLLEAGUES. IT'S LIKE TO- FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF- FOR THE WORK ON THE ANALYSIS THIS BILL- AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR OF ACCEPTED ALL OF THE SUGGESTED OR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT SO. SHEET THAT FROM FROM STAFF CERTAINLY MADE THE BILL. MUCH STRONGER. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT THIS BILL SIMPLY BILL THREE ONE FIVE FIVE THE MODERATE INCOME HOUSING ACT. RIGHT NOW THIS BILL WOULD HELP- AND PRODUCE HOUSING. AT A TIME WHEN WE CERTAINLY NEED IT MOST. NOW I'M AS- WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA'S ARE WAS WAS ALREADY IN THE MIDST. OF A HISTORIC HOUSING CRISIS- PRIOR TO THIS- KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC YOU KNOW THE ECONOMIC IN A BECAUSE BY. THIS PANDEMIC IS LIKELY TO MAKE THINGS MUCH. MUCH WORSE- IN OUR STATE NO FOR A STATE THAT HAS BECOME THE NOT OPPOSE. FOR MY HOUSE COSTS. HOMELESS THE INABILITY TO PRODUCE HOUSING- THIS PANDEMIC WILL ONLY EXACERBATE THESE PROBLEMS. AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY MOVING FORWARD SINCE MARCH SINCE THE ONSET OF THIS PANDEMIC- WE KNOW THIS THAT HOUSING- THE PRODUCTION HAS SLOWED. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. HOW AND FOR MANY IN OUR STATE HERE CALIFORNIA THE DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP SINCE FARTHER AWAY THAN EVER. THE HOUSING SITUATION WAS DIRE PRIOR TO CALL THE NINETEEN BUT IT IS EVEN MORE DIRE RIGHT NOW. AS I MENTIONED WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE RECORD HIGH RATES OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND SECURITY IN OUR STATE. WE KNOW THAT MOST COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO CHOOSE TO LIVE AND WORK IN CALIFORNIA. NO LONGER FOR- AFFORD A HOME HERE CAN AFFORD HOME UNLESS THEY COME FROM SIGNIFICANT FAMILY WEALTH. WE KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO POWER THIS STATE TEACHERS FIREFIGHTERS. SCHOOL SUPPORT STAFF HOSPITALITY WORKERS FARMWORKERS COOKS ARE SERVICE INDUSTRY MEMBERS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAN NOT AFFORD TO OWN A HOME HERE IN OUR STATE. MY ARGUE THAT THIS IS AT THE MOMENT THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO ADDRESS HOUSING. BUT I STRONGLY. I DISAGREE. EXPANDED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING MUST BE A CRITICAL PART OF OUR RECOVERY FROM THIS UNPRECEDENTED HEALTHCARE CRISIS. WE NEED TO HELP THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING. STRUGGLING TO GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR FAMILIES. CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE. AND WE CAN DO THIS WE CAN MAKE REAL PROGRESS ON HOUSING. RATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND WE CAN DO SO WITHOUT PUBLIC SUBSIDIES THE SUBSIDIES THAT WOULD CLEARLY PUT A FURTHER DENT IN OUR STATE BUDGET. THIS LARGEST ADDRESSES THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR HOUSING SUPPLY AND IT DOES SO BY REMOVING BARRIERS IS STATE LAW BARRIERS THAT PREVENT THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL LOT HOMES. AND BUILDING MORE OF THESE ACTUALLY AFFORDABLE SMALL LOT HOMES PUT HOME OWNERSHIP IN REACH FOR MANY MORE CALIFORNIANS. NOT TO MENTION IT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HAPPENED AYE VERSIFIED CAL AND STOCK. AB THREE ONE FIVE FIVE IS DESIGNED TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE NEVER NEVER BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A HOME IN THEIR OWN CITY. AND WITHIN OUR OWN. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS PERMITTING FOR SMALL HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AT TEN UNITS ARE FEWER. WHILE ENSURING THAT DEVELOPMENTS MEET ANY EXISTING LOCAL INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENTS OR ALTERNATIVELY PAY A FEE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE SMALL SCALE PROJECTS TOWN HOMES AND ROW HOUSES OFTEN FORM THE BASIS OF MUCH OFTHE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALREADY BUSINESS IN OUR STATE. BUT THEY ARE ALL VERY VERY TOUGH TO GET APPROVED. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THESE TYPES OF HOMES TO FOLLOW A MINISTERIAL STAFF LEVEL APPROVAL SO LONG AS THEY MEET THE OBJECTIVE RULES AND CRITERIA THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE THESE HOMES- WOULD STILL HAVE TO FOLLOW RELEVANT LOCALS ONLY RULES AN OBJECTIVE DESIGN CRITERIA. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXPAND AN EXISTING EXEMPTION IN CURRENT LAW THE THIS THIS BILLS LIMITED EXPANSION OF SB THIRTY FIVE IS CRITICAL. AND IT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE REQUIRINGSMALL PROJECTS OF TEN UNITS ARE LESS TO HAVE ONSITE AFFORDABLE HOUSING A 50% 50% THE CURRENT LAW SIMPLY IS NOT PRACTICAL. IT'S NOT PRACTICAL. BECAUSE ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN PUBLIC FUNDS FOR FORMER HOUSING GO TO LARGER PROJECTS PROJECTS WHERE THEY CAN GET THE MOST BANG FOR THEIR BUCK. WITHOUT THIS- EXPANSION OF THE STREAMLINING PROVISION THE SMALLER NATURALLY AFFORDABLE ENTRY LEVEL HOMES WILL NEVER NEVER GET BUILT. WE KNOW THIS BILL WILL WORK IT'LL WORK BECAUSE IT'S PROVISIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN TRIED THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN TESTED IN OUR STATE. IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- THESE THESE ARE PROVISIONS THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR NATURE HAVE BEEN POPULAR WITH BUILDERS AND HOME BUYERS. THROUGH A SMALL LOT SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE THE CITY IS CREATED MORE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. AND IT'S HELP AID THAT CITIES RECOVERY IN PAST RECESSIONS. IF WE DO THIS HERE A CALIFORNIA STATE WIDE LEVEL WE CAN AS A STATE. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL PRODUCE RESULTS. EXPANDING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING EXPANDING ACCESS TO HOUSING PERIOD. CAN BE AND SHOULD BE A KEY PART OF HELPING CALIFORNIANS RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMIC DEVASTATION CAUSED BY KOBE NINETEEN. OUR CONSTITUENTS ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE COUNTING ON US TO MAKE PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS. SENATE PASSAGE THERE IS A FUTURE FOR THEM IN OUR INCREDIBLE STATE THAT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IS STILL WITHIN REACH EVEN. EVEN IN THIS TIME OF HARDSHIP.

I WANT TO JUST BEGIN BY SAYING THAT IS A FORMER LEGISLATIVE LEADER- DURING THE GREAT RECESSION I'M FULLY COGNIZANT OF THE- FISCAL CHALLENGES. YOU FACE. AND YES WHEN WE REALLY STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT THE TIME WE ARE LIVING IN HOMELESSNESS WAS. A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BEFORE COVERT NINETEEN. IT HAS ELEVATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS DURING CO NINE. QUESTION YOU'LL TO FOR. IS ARE WE GOING TO TAKE THE STEPS TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ADVANTAGE OF THE SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PERS INTO WEST TO MAKE IT BETTER. ONCE WE ARE MERGED. CRISIS AND HERE IS THE MOST PRACTICAL EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT AND WHY AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING THE WHETHER IT'S FROM THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND OR THROUGH SOME COMBINATION OF RESOURCES- READERS TO VOTE OR ISSUE FEDERAL STIMULUS OUR STATE FUNDING IS. SOME PATTERSON I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY GREAT SUCCESS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE TIME FROM THE AMOUNT OF TIME. WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE AND- CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE STAND UP THIS PROJECT ROOM KEY. WHICH HAS BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED EFFORT TO BRING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND SHELTERED PEOPLE INTO- IN MOTEL. NOW WE'VE GOT A WAYS TO GO A AND THE NUMBERS ARE ARE STILL MOVING FORWARD BUT HERE'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE. CHALLENGE IS. HOURS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WE BRING INTO TEMPORARY SHELTER WHETHER IT'S THE MOTELS WHETHER IT'S OUR LOW BARRIER TRIAGE SHELTERS WHERE THERE IS A VARIETY OF OTHER- MEANS CITIES HAVE STOOD UP. AND COUNTIES HAVE STOOD UP TO HELP BRING PEOPLE INDOORS WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER QUESTIONS TO EDIT ACT WITHOUT ANY. SHE MAKES IT HARDER TO. INDUCE WHO ARE ON THE STREETS TO ONE TO COME IN BECAUSE THEY ASK WAS JUST GOING TO BE. ATTEMPT THING OR IS. BACK FOR ME TO MOVE THROUGH A CONTINUING TO ARE GETTING LONGER TERM HELP AND SO THIS BILL COMBINATION WITH NO THE BILL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR. BY THE CHAIRMAN I THINK YOU'RE THE ESSENTIALLY. ACTUALLY MAKING A SUBSTANTIVE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBERS OF ON SHELTERED HOMELESS PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS MONEY PLUS PUBLIC POLICY. AND THIS IS THE ESSENTIAL MONEY PAID.

AND THAT I'M JUST WONDERING I DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON WHY- PREVIOUS INVESTMENTS. DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE WE MIGHT HAVE LIKED AND WHY IS THIS INVESTMENT GOING TO PRODUCE DIFFERENT GIRLS YEAH AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION FIRST AYE AYE I. SHOULD A SERVANT OF THE YOU KNOW ONE THING. ALL THE- OTHERS IT BOTHERS PICCOLI ONE WHO IS SITTING ON THE COMMITTEE THAT'S A THIS QUIRK SILVA SUPPOSE MONTHS AND THAT IN WITHOUT SAY WITHOUT- I ALSO SHOULD RECOGNIZE MISTER BLOOM BONTA GIFTS AND- AND WHICH WAS SPOKEN HISTORY- SO I APOLOGIZE CONCERT INDEED THE ANSWER. QUITE FRANKLY HAS WORKED HERE'S HERE'S A HERE'S HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND TO THE CHAIR ABOUT THE AGE OF HOMELESSNESS. IT IS AS THE INCOME INEQUALITY WINDS MORE PEOPLE FALL ON STREET AND FALL ON THE PEOPLE OF ALL OF FAMILIES ARE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY. FROM LANDING ON THE STREETS OF THE BAR. IF YOU YOU TAKE A AT SAMPLE CARE THAT I REPRESENT OR THE LOS ANGELES REGION THE LARGEST PULL PEOPLE WHO LAND FOR PEOPLE WHO. WHO ARE ON THE VERGE OF LANDING ON BUT THERE IS. QUAN OF DATA SHOWS THE MONEY BUT NOT. WHAT IN PEOPLE. IS THERE ARE YOU SURE THE WORK ON THAT THE LEAD TO LET LET A TACKLING SUCH AS OF HOUSING SUCH A BETTER WAGE SUCH AS OF THE OTHER THINGS OTHER THAN MENTION THIS COMMITTEE BUT THERE ENOUGH THAT TO SHOW THAT THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT OUR HOUSING PEOPLE IN FACT EARLIER TODAY WAS REFERENCE- PROJECT ROOM KEY THE STATE IS I BELIEVE ARE PURSUING CONTRACTS WITH- WITH HOTELS- AND MOTELS TO HOUSE PEOPLE AND HALF OF THEM ARE ARE ALREADY FULL. OF SO THOSE PEOPLE ARE HOUSED THE LARGER THAN A WE'VE NOT TACKLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BETTER WAGES BETTER JOBS. HAS RESULTED IN A LIGHTING AN UNCOMMON EQUALITY MORE PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS. I WOULD ARE YOU SAYING- MUCH MORE INVESTMENT NEEDS AND NEEDS TO BE DONE. WELL I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE ARE SOME SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS OUT THERE THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT SENSE AT ALL OF. WHAT THEY ARE AND THEIR GOALS ARE BUYING- THAT COULD BE BETTER SPENT IN THE HOUSE THIS TO ME AFTER TEN. REALLY FIGURE THAT OUT AND EVEN YOU KNOW BUT I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT THAT THINGS HAVE OVERALL BEEN WORKING EVEN THE GOVRNOR AND HIS STATE THE STATE. ADDRESS IT DOESN'T. AND IT. IS THAT WHEN IT WAS A SAYS THE GOVERNOR'S IN THIS ADDED WHEN WAS SPENDING PROPOSAL. THAT NEW FOR. COULD QUICKLY. WITHOUT DEMONSTRATING MUCH PROGRESS. INVESTMENTS ARE MADE WITHOUT A CLEAR PLAN SO. I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW- URGED THAT WE THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT. WHERE THE FUNDING IS GOING BECAUSE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IF YOU'RE DOING A BETTER JOB SPENDING THE LAST TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION IN DOING AND USING THAT. YOU KNOW THE DATA THAT WE HAVEN'T REQUIRED IN ORDER SPEND MORE ON THE THINGS THAT WORK AND SPENT MOST OF THE THINGS THAT DON'T WORK AND THAT WOULD DO A HECK OF A LOT MORE GOOD. THAN JUST THROWING TWO POINT TWO BILLION MORE DOLLARS THE PROBLEM. IS NOT. NINE FIVE. I AT LEAST APPRECIATE THE- TO. ADD TACKLE HOMELESSNESS SITUATION IN THE- IN A MAJOR WAY. I CALL ME BACK OF COURSE THANK YOU I BELIEVE THE QUESTION WAS THE DOLLARS THAT ARE EXPENDED BY THE STATE- TO THE CHAIR- IF THAT IF WE SEE IN SOME- SOME SUCCESS IN THE IT WAS YES I DON'T THE QUESTION WAS HAVE WE DONE ENOUGH. HOMELESSNESS TO RESOLVE THE- ANSWER ACTUALLY NOT. A 100% WE SHOULD BE DOING A HECK OF A LOT MORE WE SHOULD BE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT A TWO BILLION DOLLAR REQUEST OUT OF A STAFF OF TWO BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET THE NUMBER THAT'S BEEN SEVERAL BY THE GOVERNOR. HI MOM WHEN YOU REALLY THINK OF 1% THIS IS THE- SHE- OUR- OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES IN THE STATE. WE'RE ONLY GONNA ALLOCATE CLOSE OUR VALUES I THOUGHT SO I WOULD ARGUE WE NEED TO INVEST A LOT MORE. MISTER COOPER THANK YOU MISTER TURNER SO I CAN ACTUALLY RESIST THE OPPORTUNITY EVEN THOUGH THE DAY IT'S LIKE TO- TO NOTE FOR MISTER KIND OF ACTIVE A BILL UP TODAY THAT'S ON CONSENT IT'S A. B. TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SIX THAT ACTUALLY IT'S PARTISAN ALL THEIR EIGHTEEN NUMBER. PUTTING THE ASSEMBLY REPUBLICAN LEADER. OF THE WITH ATTACHED. US TO COLLECT A LOT OF DATA SO WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE ABOUT WHAT PROGRAMS ARE WORKING ONE ON WE CAN DO GOOD DATA DRIVEN POLICY MAKING AN INVESTOR SCARCE DOLLARS IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WHY SO I JUST WANTED TO- YOU KNOW SUPPORT WOOD MISTER SANTIAGO TRYING TO DO. IN DRUGS ABOUT. RESEARCH PROBLEM BUT- WITH YOUR. THAT'S ABOUT THE NEED FOR TIME FOR TRANS WITH TAXPAYER AND ABOUT THE NEED GATHER DATA GOOD DO GOOD DATA TERM POLICY MAKING SO JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THAT BILL WAS ON- CONSENT TODAY AND THAT IF I TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF IT. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE WELCOME TO. IF YOU WANT WE CAN NOTE THAT BUT- THAT'S UP TO YOU- I WILL. ALSO SAY THAT I THINK. WE ALL. I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE WE NEED MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND ACTUALLY THE NEXT BILL. THAT I'M GONNA PROCESS. TO TACKLE THAT TOPIC. ONE OF THE CHILD WE HAVE. IS NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE- A- HUNDRED. THOUSAND AND- CALIFORNIANS ANY. WEAKER ALMOST. THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE ON THE EDGE OF BECOMING HOME THIS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY CHALLENGE IN. OUR IN STEMMING. THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT ARE BECOMING HOMELESS EVERY NIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE A I THINK THE STATISTIC IS. WHAT HOUSING HUNDRED THIRTY THREE PEOPLE EVERY. AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS ON THAT AMAZINGLY START. AND THAT'S ONE. THAT'S ONE SO WE'RE REALLY FACING. IT'S NOT JUST HOUSING THE FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY HOMELESS IT IS NOT A STEP. IN THE TIME. UP WHAT. I THINK WALGREENS. HE AN ON GOING. TO ADDRESS THIS THIS PANDEMIC HAS ONLY INTENSIFIED THIS THIS OUTLOOK AND- AND THIS CAN BE HARD NOW ONE THING I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST IS- I KNOW THE SOURCE OF THE- AND OUR GENERAL FUND HAS- BEEN DECIMATED JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS AND I THINK. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT POINT. SOURCES FUNDING ARE AND I KNOW THIS IS A CONVERSATION A NUMBER OF US HAVE HAD BUT I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THAT SO THAT. BACK TO MISTER SANTIAGO. YEAH AND ALL THAT IS MY CLOTHES IN THE INTEREST OF THE COMMITTEE'S TIME AND- WANT TO THANK ALL THE JOINT AUTHORS THE COMMITTEE FOR. THE WORLD THIS. LEAVING A LONG TIME. A FUNDING SELECTION OR ONLY JUST NUMBERS CONTINUE TO EXPLODE- AND- I. YOU DO EVEN THOUGH WITH THIS.

IN A LOT OF TIME. AND WHAT TO HIS TESTIMONY THIS. I'M COLLEAGUES THIS BILL. IS ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HOMELESS PROGRAMS- EXACTLY THE DISCUSSION WE WERE JUST HAVING WITH THE LAST BILL ARE AND I KNOW IT IT THIS IS A CAN KNOWS FULL WELL THE DIRE CRISIS HOMELESSNESS BUT AS A REFERENCE BEFORE. EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS FOR HOMELESS. W HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF ON SHELTER HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE NATION. AND AS I JUST STATED AS PEOPLE ARE HOUSE MORE FOR INTO HOMELESSNESS. IN LA FOR EVERY HUNDRED THIRTY THREE PEOPLE HOUSE. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR TO HOMELESSNESS. IN OAKLAND FOR EVERY ONE PERSON WHO IS ALLEGED TO FALL INTO. AND UNFORTUNATELY AM I AM- SUCH A REPORT THAT IN MY OWN CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO FOR EVERYONE PERSON HOUSE THREE FALL TO HOMELESSNESS. AND THIS WAS BEFORE CORONA VIRUS. THE PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED THE CRISIS GASOLINE ON FIRE. IF WE DON'T HOUSE PEOPLE WE ARE INTENSIFIED THE VIRUS SPREAD. AND ECONOMIC CALAMITIES LEADING TO A NEW WAVE OF HOMELESSNESS AS MR SANTIAGO JUST MENTION- THE ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS ARE THAT HOME ASSIST. GREECE BY 12% OUR STATE A LOT. AS A RESULT. GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL OF REGIONAL HOMELESS ADVISORS AND I WANT TO THANK OUR THE CULTURES OF THAT EFFORT. TIME BURKE WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOON AS WELL AS SUPERVISOR MARK REALLY THOMAS FROM LA BOTH OF WHOM ARE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. EARLIER THIS YEAR BEFORE CRIME VIRUS WHEN OUR GOVERNOR WAS DEVOTING HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS ON HOMELESSNESS. THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL MADE A KEY RECOMMENDATION THAT OUR STATE ESTABLISHED AND ENFORCEABLE RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY MANDATE TO END HOMELESSNESS. SINCE WE ALL KNOW THAT PURELY VOLUNTARY EFFORTS BY MYRIAD OF LOCAL AND STATE JURISDICTIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FUNDING HAVE FAILED WITHOUT THAT. AND I WANT ALSO KNOWLEDGE- MISTER SANTIAGO IS A JOINT AUTHORED THIS BILL. WAS LOOK AT THE CONDITION WE BOTH INTRODUCED BILLS THE SPACE MERGER EFFORTS FOR THIS CAR. THE SECOND CONVERSATION THAT HAS LED TO THIS BILL IS A LEGAL ONE. BEFORE CORONAVIRUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAD COME UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS FROM. CONSTITUENTS PUBLIC INTEREST ADVOCATES BUSINESS COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS OF COURSE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS. THE LATEST PRESSURE POINT HAS BEEN IN THE COURTS. IN RECENT YEARS ADVOCATES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AROUND STATE WHO FAIL TO HOUSE THE ON SHELTER. THE NINTH CIRCUIT BOISE CASE BEING THE MOST PROMINENT. I KNOW OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS BECAUSE IN ORANGE COUNTY AND CITIES AND HER COUNTY. THEY WERE SUCCESSFULLY SUED OVER THIS. AND WHILE ONE FEDERAL JUDGE JUDGE DAVID CARTER HAS IT WE HELD. ACCOUNTABLE TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SHELTERS. THAT LEGAL PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLEX EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING FOR LITIGANTS LOCAL GOT AND I. OUT A HAVE FILE LAWSUITS WERE SENT DEMAND LETTERS TO LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO. SANTA CRUZ SACRAMENTO SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER JURISDICTION. THIS BILL WILL CREATE A SAYS HOLD STATE AND LOCAL ACCOUNT FOR HOUSING ARE ON SHELTER BASED ON MEASURABLE GOALS AN EXISTING RESOURCES IDENTIFIED FOR THAT PURPOSE. HOPEFULLY AVOIDING THE NEED FOR COMPLEX EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING LEGAL FIGHTS AROUND STATE. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ASSESS THEIR RESOURCES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND TO PROVIDE THAT ANALYSIS TO OUR STATE HOMELESSNESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. IT REQUIRES EACH CFC TO REVIEW THAT ANALYSIS AND DEVELOP BENCHMARK GOALS. BASED ON THOSE GOALS IT REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP AN ACTIONABLE PLAN TO REDUCE PROCESS BY 90% BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AND IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS FORWARD HE WOULD ESTABLISH AN INSPECTOR GENERAL POSITION HOMELESSNESS INSPECTOR GENERAL. THAT COULD BRING A PUBLIC RIGHT OF ACTION AGAINST STATE AGENCIES OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR FAILING TO SUBMIT A PLAN I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF ACTION WOULD BE LIMITED TO EXISTING RESOURCES SET ASIDE BY A JURISDICTION. TO RATHER THAN WAITING FOR CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK NUMBER TWO OR EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING LAWSUITS TO FORCE THIS QUESTION OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AROUND HOMELESSNESS. THIS BILL WOULD PROACTIVELY ESTABLISH PLANS. METRICS ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT. BY HOLDING ALL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE BASED ON THESE BENCHMARKS THIS BILL WILL HOPEFULLY MOVE CALIFORNIA TORE FINALLY ADDRESSING THE MORAL CRISIS OF OUR DAY. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER TO OUR WITNESSES AS I MENTIONED- THE MAYOR OF THIS CITY THE CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL OF REGIONAL HOMELESS ADVISORS. AND A FORMER SENATE PRESIDENT. MAYOR STEINBERG AND THEN- WE WILL HEAR FROM THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO- FROM MORE A TOP TOP. I JUST WANNA MENTION- THAT SENIOR SUPERVISOR NEEDS AND FLETCHER WAS PART OF THE COUNCIL AND SUPPORTED THE KEY RECOMMENDATION THAT THIS THIS LAWS BASED ON SO WITH THAT. ASK YOUR SUPPORT AND WILL TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR OUR FIRST WITNESS IS- MAYOR DEAR SACRAMENTO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO FOR. YOUR COURAGE IN. BEING WILL WILLING TO PUT FORWARD A VERY PROVOCATIVE BUT IN. AND AS YOU SAID THIS BILL REFLECTS. THE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT- OF THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL OF HOMELESS ADVISORS INCLUDING NINE OUT OF THIRTEEN MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ONE. ASPECT OR ANOTHER LET ME STIPULATE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND DAD- A PUBLIC POLICY LIKE THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE STORY AND IT WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM JUST AS MORE MONEY ALONE- WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT A COMBINATION OF MORE CLEAR AND DIRECT PUBLIC POLICY. IN BORN THERE WERE SAYS THE BEST CHANCE. WE POSSIBLY HAVE TO MAKE A GREATER DANTE IN THIS PROBLEM. THE LEGISLATURE IS OBVIOUSLY A POLICY MAKING BODY I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SERVE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. AND WHEN WE STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT IT JUST A MOMENT THIS WHAT ARE COMMISSION GRAPPLED WITH WHAT IS THE PUBLIC POLICY IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS. I DON'T MEAN TO DENIGRATE ANY OF THE HEROIC EFFORTS DID GO ON AMONG GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS. OUR PUBLIC POLICY IS LET'S DO THE VERY BEST WE CAN. EVERYTHING WE DO IS OPTIONAL INVOLUNTARY THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO BRING PEOPLE INDOORS. THERE IS NO HOUSING PRODUCTION STANDARD OF ANY KIND. THERE IS A EFFOR TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES OFTENTIMES DATA HAPHAZARD WAY FRANKLY AMONG THE NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE THE PROBLEMS INTERSECTED NO NO ARTIFICIAL BOUNDARIES WE ARE SEPARATE FUNDING STREAM SEPARATE PROGRAMS AN ALPHABET SOUP OF- OF APPROACHES. AND NOTHING WE DO IS DRIVEN TOWARDS- IT ENFORCEABLE RESULT. AND AS WE SAID DURING OUR COMMISSION PROCEEDINGS NAME ANOTHER AREA OF MAJOR PUBLIC POLICY WHERE EVERYTHING THAT GOVERNMENT CALLS ON THAT THE PEOPLE TO DO IS OPTIONAL OR VOLUNTARY IF IT MATTERS. WE REQUIRE IT I'LL GIVE THE CREDIT TO SUPERVISOR FLETCHER BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE WHO CAME UP WITH THIS AND I'M SORRY IF I STEAL IS LINED BUT IT'S SO GOOD. AND THAT IS. WHEN WE DECIDED CLIMATE CHANGE WAS A MORAL IMPERATIVE. AND WE DECIDED THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY WITH A KEY PIECE OF ADDRESSING CLIMATE WE DID NOT SAY TO THE ENERGY WORLD OR THE LCAL AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS ARE TO THE STATE ITSELF. PLEASE VOLUNTEER TO SUBSTITUTE OUT YOUR FOSSIL FUELS RENEWABLE ENERGY DO THE BEST YOU CAN REPORT TO WEST WHEN YOU CANAND HERE'S SOME MONEY AND GOOD LUCK WE DIDN'T DO THAT. WE REQUIRED IT THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA THE LAWS I WAS PART OF THAT YOU'RE PART OF REQUIRE US TO MEET. AGGRESSIVE BUT REASONABLE PERCENTAGES AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOUR BILL MISTER CHAIRMAN SEEKS TO DO. IT DOESN'T SAY FINE MONEY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY CLEAR THAT ACCOUNTABILITY NEED IT SHOULD ONLY BE COMMENSURATE IN A FAIR WAY WITH RESOURCES. BUT IF ANYBODY BELIEVES THAT THE CURRENT SOURCE MIX WE HAVE. BEING SPENT WITH THE MAC. AMOUNT OF URGENCY IN TERMS OF HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET MONEY OUT. WITH THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COLLABORATION IN TERMS OF JURISDICTIONS. COORDINATING OR CONSOLIDATING THE RESOURCES TO GET MORE PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. AND THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON THAT OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING ON SHELTERED HOMELESSNESS NOT AS AN END. BUT IS THE BEGINNING OF MOVING PEOPLE. THROUGH A CONTINUUM TO PERMANENT HOUSING. NOBODY CAN MAKE THAT CLAIM THAT WE ARE DOING THIS IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THE LAWSUIT AND WHY YOU SEE. THE FRUSTRATION THIS WOULD GIVE US. EIGHT EIGHT AND ENFORCEABLE- FOCUS THAT COMBINED WITH RESOURCES I BELIEVE WOULD MOVE US TOWARDS GREATER PERCENTAGES IN NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY GETTING OFF THE STREET I THINK THIS IS A VITAL BILL NOT JUST TO TALK TO DO THE INTERESTING PROVOCATIVE IDEA BUT HE IS A VITAL SUPERVISOR RIDLEY THOMAS MICE CO SPONSOR AND I IN THE ENTIRE COMMISSION. BELIEVE IT WITHOUT A CLEAR PUBLIC POLICY BUT IT IS NO LONGER LEGALLY ACCEPTABLE FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE OUTDOORS WITHOUT. WITHOUT ANY MOVE TOWARDS TRYING TO HELP THEM COME INDOORS THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY WE SPEND IT IN THE END ISN'T GOING TO GET BETTER BUT THAT COMBINATION OF THE TWO. MONEY AND REQUIRE AND WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS NECESSARY FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PEOPLE AND OUR COMMUNITIES. WE THINK WE CAN ALL MOVE THIS ISSUE- TOWARDS A MUCH BETTER TRAJECTORY AND I APPRECIATE THE- THE EFFORT AND I HOPE THAT- THIS BILL IS A CENTERPIECE OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE- CHOOSES TO DO AROUND HOMELESSNESS THIS YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MAYOR OF THE MODERATOR COULD NOT OPEN UP THE LINE FOR OUR SECOND WITNESS MORE ATOP FROM THE CITY CENTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MATTER MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M WHERE A TOP ON THE HOSPICE CITY OF SAN DIEGO CERTAINLY AN HONOR TO FOLLOW THEIR CAMARO. MERIT THEIR STEINBERG BACK TO AND THE CITY IS- VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT. OF AB THIRTY TO SIXTY NINE. DIEGO IT'S ONE OF THE FEW JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ACTUALLY SEEN A REDUCTION IN HOME A THREE IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE'RE CERTAINLY PLEASED WITH THAT THAT THAT THAT. BUT WE KNOW THAT MORE MUST BE DONE. THE CITY HAVE A SELF IMPOSED GOAL TO REDUCE ON SHELTER HOMELESS IN OUR CITY BY 50% IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THE REDUCTION GOAL OF 90% BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE INCLUDED IN AB THIRTY TO SIXTY NINE IS IN LINE WITH THE FANS WITH SAN DIEGO GOAL. IT'S A STRETCH GOAL BUT WE DO BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT CALL. WE ALSO KNOW THAT REDUCING HOMELESSNESS REQUIRES MORE THAN JUST THE WORK DONE AND DESPERATE CITIES. AND INSTEAD MUST BE REGIONAL. INTER REGIONAL AND EVEN STATEWIDE. THIS BILL FURTHER IF THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. AND WE THINK CREATES THE RIGHT MIX OF CARROTS AND STICKS TO TACKLE HOMELESSNESS. THIS THAT IF THE DOCTOR AND FUNDED CONSEQUENTIAL HOMELESS REDUCTION MEASURES. SAN DIEGO BELIEVES THAT ALL CITY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO DO THEIR PART TO AND HOMELESSNESS. WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE MEASURE AND KINDLY ASK FOR YOUR I THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN TO ANY- ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

OKAY GREAT THANK YOU I THINK WE'LL MOVE NEXT TO OPT FILE ITEM TWENTY TWO AB THREE ZERO FOUR ZERO- BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER Q. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THINKING COLLEAGUES COLLEAGUES THIS BILL WOULD HELP CITIES GET THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE WHEN THEY ALLOW UP TO FOUR UNITS PER PARCEL. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY CREATING THEIR HEALTH PLANS FOR THE MISSION EIGHT CITY THIS IS A COMMON PROCESS THAT HAPPENS EVERY EIGHT YEARS BUT THIS TIME IT'S GONNA LOOK DIFFERENT DUE TO THE WORK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE DID A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK WHEN WE REQUIRE OUR STATES PROCESS FOR DETERMINING OVERALL HOUSING DEMAND. TO REFLECT NOT JUST GROWTH BUT THE BACKLOG OF MILLIONS OF UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT THIS TIME AROUND THE BAR'S GONNA BE HIGHER FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WILL HAVE TO MAKE SOME HARD DECISIONS THAT THEY MAY HAVE POSTPONED FOR SOME DECADES. ONE OF THOSE HARD DECISIONS MIGHT BE TO ALLOW FOR MORE HOUSING IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUSIVELY SINGLE FAMILIES ON. THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THEM OR WHO LIVES IN THEM. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE ZONE AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF LAND IN CALIFORNIA TO SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. IT IS NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF LAND AND GIVING CHANGING CLIMATE. WILD VIRUS AND PUNISHING COMMUTES WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUTWARDS. WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE EXCLUSIONARY. AND OFTEN REYES SPACING CLASS SPACE NATURE OF THIS DESIGN. AB THIRTY FORTY SIGNALS TO CITIES THAT THE STATE WILL GUARANTEE THEM ISSUED HOUSING TARGETS FOR EVERY SITE THAT THEY UP ZONE. FROM SINGLE FAMILY TO FOR PLEXUS. THE VALUE TO CITIES AND TOWNS IS THAT THEY CAN CALCULATE THIS CREDIT UP FRONT. RATHER THAN AT THE END OF THE PROCESS THIS BILL THIS BILL BILLS IN GUARDRAILS TO ENSURE THAT NEW UNITS COULD BE CREATED. THIS BILL THIS BILL ALSO BUILT IN AND CENTERS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CREDIT GRANTED BY THE BILL. ALLOWING EASY TO GIVE ADDITIONAL CREDIT. AND BEFORE TURN IT OVER TO WITNESSES I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE STILL ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL PROPERTY LINES. WITH THE PROCESS THEY'RE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING. AND THAT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LAND USE A CONTEST. TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE EXACT RIGHT AMOUNT OF CREDIT. WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WINTER STAND WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- SUNDAY GEORGE AND- JASON RHYNE INTERNAT THE MODERATOR TO CONNECT US WITH THE FIRST WITNESS SEEM TO GEORGE. YES ANY GEORGE YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

AND TO FIND A WAY TO INCREASE THE DENSITY THAT OUR COMMUNITY TO MEET BOTH LOCAL AND STATE OBJECTIVES OF A DISTRICT LIKE WHAT WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED. TO FIND MORE ADEQUATE SITE THIS IS A GREAT WAY OF PROVIDING THAT SITE CREDIT- BASED ON THAT AND WE DON'T EVEN WE SEEN IT DONE SIMILARLY WITH EXCESS READ WHILE IN UNIT SO WE REALLY SUPPORT THE GERMAN I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING THIS OUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

FIVE MISTER CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE MEMBER SORRY BUT THAT'S NOT BROUGH NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED THIS IS CHRIS WOULD DROP WITH LIVABLE CALIFORNIA AND- WE OPPOSE EIGHT THE THIRTY FORTY. CALIFORNIA DOESN'T JUST HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE WE HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGE AND AB THIRTY FORTY WOULD NOT IMPROVE THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN FACT IT VERY LIKELY WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT I MANDATING THE REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING SINGLE FAMILY STOCKTON FOR AND WITH EIGHTY USE POTENTIALLY EIGHT. MULTI FAMILY UNITS THE BILL WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER THE LUXURY DEVELOPMENTS DISPLACING COHESIVE EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS. IT POLICY WOULD BE A GIVEAWAY TO BIG DEVELOPERS AT THE EXPENSE OF DESTRUCTION OF EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES. AB THIRTY FORTY IS REALLY ANOTHER TOP DOWN ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS THE MANDATE STUDENTS TO BE AND COUNTLESS SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS. AND IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING THOSE PROVISIONS US- SPECIFICALLY TARGET. HOMES THAT ARE FIFTEEN OR MORE YEARS OLDER THIS SUGGESTS A RIFLE SHOT THE NEXT BUSINESS DAY. ESTABLISHED AND COHESIVE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHEN I WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD BLOCK WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE GETS KNOCKED OUT. AND REPLACED BY A LARGER BOTHERED BUT THE FAMILY ABOUT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO WHAT. WE DO. THE COROLLARY IS THE PROBLEM IS THE BILL'S BACK AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS. AND AS WE KNOW- OFTEN EVEN MODERATE AND ABOUT MODERATE INCOME REQUIREMENTS YOU'RE SKIRTED. SO AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO DISPEL WHAT I THINK UNINTENTIONALLY INCENTIVIZE. LUXURY OR HIGH AND MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT SCREW JUSTIN COMMUNITIES. AND THE LAST POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THAT THE NEIGHBORHOODS MOST VULNERABLE TO THIS KIND OF. DE FACTO UP SO THEY CAN DISPLACEMENT ARE PRETTY DECENT URBAN CORES. WHICH IN MANY CASES RECORDS OF LOWER INCOME AND MINORITY HOMEOWNERSHIP. SO NEIGHBORHOODS MAILLET LIKE CRENSHAW WE LOOK PARK. HEIGHTS ELSEWHERE WOULD BE PRIME TARGETS LASTLY LIKE MANY HOUSING IN THE CONTEXT OF CLOTHES NINETEEN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATE HOUSING NEEDS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN SIX MONTHS MUCH LESS FOR SIX YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WHEN THIS BILL WOULD REALLY KICK **** AND SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE EMAIL PHONES ON AT THIRTY FORTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NUMBER FIVE. EIGHT FIVE TWO EIGHT THE LINE IS OPEN. HI MY NAME JOKES TO WORK CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES. OKAY HI JILL DILLARD I'M WITH- ANYTHING ELSE FOR TREES WHICH THEN BY MIDDLE GROUP AND THE GLOBAL CALIFORNIA SAN FERNANDO VALLEY I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SOME- MARKETING AND GEN X. HOME HOMEOWNERS THE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD HOUSING ISSUES BAFFLING TO ME WE HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE AFFECTED THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY CHEST ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. RESIDENTS MANY MANY OF THEM FAMILY HOMES AND REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF THIS IN THE BAY AREA AND I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCES IN THE TWO FIVE STATE BUT WE HAVE MANY MANY FIBER FILLED WITH CHINO AND BLACK WORKING CLASS MEMBERS ALL OF WHOM WOULD BE DISRUPTED IN POTENTIAL- BOUGHT OUT SHOVED OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS BY DISH I JUST DON'T. IF. I DON'T THINK IT'S NOT TO IT'S NOT FOR WHO SOUTHERN CAL. WE LOOK LIKE IT WAS FOUGHT FOR THE BAY AREA AND WE ASK THAT YOU. AND START ALL OF THANK YOU MUCH. IF ANYONE ELSE IS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU MAKE YOU UP BY PRESSING ONE THEN IT IS ZERO AGAIN THAT IS ONE. THEN FZERO FOR OPPOSITION. NO ONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU ARE BRINGING IT BACK ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A OUR MOTION. YEAH SO WE HAVE A MOTION FROM US A MEMBER QUIRK SILVA A SECOND FROM MISTER GLORIA- MISTER TURNER JOY TO CLOSE I DO WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS- IN RESPONSE TO THE OPPOSITION FIRST OF ALL- THE IDEA THAT THISIS A MANDATE IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE- AND IN FACT- I WOULD SAY I DON'T THINK THAT- SEE SACROILIITIS CITIES OR THE IRVINE COUNTY CALIFORNIA OR THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES- WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED THIS BILL IF IT WASN'T MANDATE. THIS IS PURELY THEN THE LOCAL CONTROL OF ANY JURISDICTION TO DECIDE WHAT IS IT THAT THEY WANT TO DO SO NOTHING ABOUT THAT COULD BE FURTHER THAN THE TRUTH- I WANT TO MENTION THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHY WE SAY APPLICABLE SIX NEED TO INVOLVE HOUSING OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OF THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT NEWER HOUSING IS LESS LIKELY TO BE DEMOLISHED WE'RE GONNA. FOCUS ON. ON SIDE EFFECTS. I'M IN THE- BLESSING I JUST HAVE TO SUGGEST. IT IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED THAT SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF- OF OFTENTIMES CLASS SPACE MOTIVATIONS AND RACE BASED MOTIVATIONS AND THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THE OPPOSITION WILL TRY TO CLOAK THEIR OPPOSITION ARE REFERRING TO THEIR DESIRE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS INCREDIBLY IRONIC AND FRANKLY SLIGHTLY OFFENSIVE- BUT TAKING THEM AT FACE VALUE- JUST SIMPLY WRONG SO I HAVE TO SAY THAT. AND THAT WITH THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ADULT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- COURT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS Q. FIVE Q.
