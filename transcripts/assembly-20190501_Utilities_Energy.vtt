00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:31.850
THINGS THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.285
WITH BATTERIES AND ELECTRICITY

00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:35.253
BUT WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.354
IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A

00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:37.723
PORTFOLIO APPROACH.

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:38.824
WHETHER YOUR GOAL IS

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.892
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS --

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:44.629
RESILIENCY IN OUR ENERGY SYSTEM.

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:47.532
COST SAVINGS FOR ONE OF OUR BIG

00:22:47.599 --> 00:22:49.000
CHALLENGES THAT I THINK THERE'S

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:50.102
A GROWING AWARENESS ABOUT IS

00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:51.703
WHAT WE GONNA DO ABOUT ENERGY

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.739
STORAGE -- BATTERIES ARE

00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:55.240
DEFINITELY GONNA PLAY A ROLE BU

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:56.274
ARE THEY GOING TO MEET ALL THE

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:57.976
NEEDS AND THEIR I THINK THERE'S

00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.378
A GROWING AWARENESS NOT ONLY IN

00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:02.781
IN EUROPE BUT ACROSS AMERICA.

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:04.816
THAT -- WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:07.052
OTHER -- LONGER TERM ENERGY

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:09.788
STORAGE OPTIONS AND RENEWABLE

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:15.694
GASES WE BELIEVE COMPLACENT

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:17.295
AFRICAN ROLE IN THAT.

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:19.264
THERE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN

00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:20.232
THE BRIEFING PAPER THAT I JUST

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:20.432
WANT.

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:23.168
TO SPEAK TO A A COUPLE OF THOSE --

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.303
THERE.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:26.805
THERE'S THERE'S A BROAD QUESTION

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:28.507
ABOUT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO MOVE

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:30.942
AHEAD WITH THIS EFFORT AT THIS

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:33.311
TIME ARE THERE OTHER -- EFFORTS

00:23:33.378 --> 00:23:34.646
THAT NEED TO PLAY OUT FIRST

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:35.847
RATHER LEGISLATION THAT NEEDS TO

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.315
PLAY OUT FIRST BEFORE WE MOVE

00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:38.316
AHEAD WITH.

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:40.285
A STRATEGY LIKE THIS A PROGRAM

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:42.254
LIKE THIS AND WE BELIEVE THAT

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.589
THIS APPROACH -- DEVELOPING A

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:46.825
CONSUMER ORIENTED INCENTIVE FOR

00:23:46.892 --> 00:23:48.059
THE USE OF A NOBLE GASES IS

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:50.896
COMPLEMENTARY TO AT OTHER

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:51.930
EFFORTS UNDER WAY.

00:23:51.997 --> 00:23:53.098
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE EFFORTS

00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:54.699
THAT ARE ACTIVE RIGHT NOW ARE

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:57.969
INCENTIVES TO PRODUCE --

00:23:58.036 --> 00:24:00.405
RENEWABLE GASES IN CALIFORNIA

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:03.375
NOT NECESSARILY TO CONSUME THEM

00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:06.611
AND NOT DIRECTED AT THE THE

00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:07.712
CONSUMERS AND WE THINK IT'S

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:08.814
IMPORTANT TO HAVE BOTH.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.782
JUST LIKE WE'VE DONE OVER TIME

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:12.651
IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SPACE WE

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:14.219
HAD INCENTIVES TO PURGE TO

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.253
PRODUCE MORE SOLAR AND WIND AND

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.622
WE INCENTIVES FOR CONSUMERS. TO

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:19.658
TO BUY THAT -- THAT ENERGY OR

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:21.092
THAT ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM

00:24:21.159 --> 00:24:25.964
THE SOURCES -- ONE OTHER POINT I

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:28.033
WANT TO MENTION -- RELATES TO A

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:30.535
COMMENT IN REFERENCE TO AB

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:31.436
THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO WHICH IS A

00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:32.037
MISS FRIEDMAN BILL FROM LAST

00:24:32.103 --> 00:24:33.104
YEAR.

00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:36.675
THIS IS A THE REFERENCE IN THE

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:38.376
IN THE BRIEFING PAPER IT.

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:40.846
WE THANK -- CONTINUES A COMMON

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:43.949
MISPERCEPTION ABOUT A FEW BILLS

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:45.383
THAT PASSED IN THE LAST YEAR.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.086
TO THEY WERE AND IF YOU IF YOU

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:50.055
LOOK AT THE THE LANGUAGE THEY

00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:52.757
ARE -- AND D. CARBONIZATION OF

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:55.861
BUILDING DE CARBONIZATION BILLS.

00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:56.895
THE AGENCY SOME OF THE

00:24:56.962 --> 00:24:58.697
CALIFORNIA AGENCIES HAVE CHOSEN

00:24:58.763 --> 00:24:59.731
TO FOCUS ON BUILDING

00:24:59.798 --> 00:25:01.900
ELECTRIFICATION.

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:03.301
BUT THE LEGISLATION -- THAT

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:04.870
PASSED WAS BUILDING D.

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:06.037
CARBONIZATION.

00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:07.873
UNDER THAT UMBRELLA WE THINK

00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:11.042
WE'RE NOBLE GASES ARE -- TODAY

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:14.579
AND CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:16.982
FOR BUILDING D. CARBONIZATION

00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:18.817
ELECTRIFICATION IS ONE STRATEGY.

00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:20.352
NOBLE GASES IS ANOTHER STRATEGY

00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:22.254
THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR YOUR

METHANE RELATIVE TO CALIFORNIA

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:53.311
CALIFORNIA'S DEMAND FOR METHANE

00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:54.279
GAS.

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:55.380
AND THAT SOME OF THE SOURCES ARE

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.248
VERY HIGH COST WE NEED TO GET

00:26:57.315 --> 00:26:59.317
CLEAR ON HOW MUCH REALLY EXISTS

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:01.019
AT WHAT COST AND IMPORTANTLY

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:02.687

YEAR.

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:19.738
THE CBC'S ALSO ASSESSING OPTIONS

NINETEEN I PER AND IN ADDITION

00:27:29.614 --> 00:27:31.383
THERE SHOULD BE A PC ACTIVITY TO

00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:32.550
CONSIDER BY A MYTH THAT METHANE

00:27:32.617 --> 00:27:33.318

IMPLICATIONS OF THESE EFFORTS

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:42.727
WHICH MIGHT END UP WORKING AT

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:44.429
CROSS PURPOSES WITH OTHER STATE

INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:49.601
BUT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:50.435
WORKING THROUGH BOTH THESE

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:52.170
EXISTING FORMS AND WHAT THE

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:53.972
AUTHOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS --

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:56.441
ON TOPICS RELATED TO BEST USING

00:27:56.508 --> 00:28:02.647
CALIFORNIA'S METHANE AND BY MATH

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:05.316

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:05.884
AND THEN MICHAEL BOOKER ON

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:06.584
BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:07.218
CONSUMERS ASSOCIATIONAL TRYING

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:08.219
TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BUSINESS

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:09.487
PERSPECTIVE -- OUR CLIENTS

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:10.889
REPRESENT -- FOLKS THAT ARE NOT

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:11.790
ONLY IN THE BUSINESS OF

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.925
DEVELOPING BY METHANE PROJECTS

00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:15.260
AND SO WERE HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE.

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:16.594
THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THAT

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:17.829
BY A METHANE THOSE S.

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:19.831
TRANSPORTATION FUEL NOT FOR USE

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:21.132
IN BUILDINGS NOT FOR USE IN

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:23.401
HOMES NOT FOR USE IN BUSINESSES.

00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:25.170
BUSINESS COMMUNITY CAN'T AFFORD

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:27.505
TO USE BY METHANE IN OUR

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:28.640
FACTORIES PERIOD.

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:31.509
IT'S FIVE TEN FIFTEEN TIMES AS

00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:32.677
EXPENSIVE.

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:34.512
AS RENEWED AS CONVENTIONAL

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:36.314
NATURAL GAS SO IT'S NOT AN

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:37.882
OPTION FOR US AND WON'T BE AN

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:39.017
OPTION FOR US.

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:40.151
AND THAT GETS LOST IN THIS

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:41.653
DEBATE A LOT IT'S GOING TO BE

00:28:41.719 --> 00:28:43.221
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:43.788
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS ARE

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.123
GOING TO BE CONSIDERING AT SOME

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.591
POINT THIS YEAR.

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.393
IS COST CONCERNS ABOUT ELECT

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.361
RISING ELECTRICITY PRICES FROM

00:28:50.428 --> 00:28:52.297
ALL OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:52.997
WILD FIRE.

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:54.299
AND IT IS GOING TO BE VERY

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:56.301
DIFFICULT TO ELECTRIFY BUILDINGS

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:58.369
GOING FORWARD IF OUR ELECTRICITY

00:28:58.436 --> 00:28:59.871
PRICES ARE SUPER HIGH.

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:01.573
BUT USING BIO METHANE AND

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:03.108
BUILDINGS THAT HAS THE EXACT

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:05.343
SAME EMISSIONS PROFILE.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.445
DOES CONVENTIONAL NATURAL GAS SO

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:11.049
IT'S NOT A SOLUTION TO REDUCE CO

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:12.417
TWO FROM BUILDINGS.

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:15.153
NOT NOW NOT TEN YEARS FROM NOW

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.187
AND IT'S NOT COST EFFECTIVE

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:18.256
FORCE WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:19.924
DON'T GET ME WRONG MY DERRY'S

00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:20.725
ARE PRODUCING A TREMENDOUS

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:22.060
AMOUNT OF BY METHANE.

00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:23.728
IT'S ALL GOING INTO

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.897
TRANSPORTATION FEEL AND IT HAS A

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:27.832
VERY VALUABLE BENEFITS THEY'RE

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:29.701
NOT ONLY REDUCES NOTHING ITS

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:31.102
CARBON NEGATIVE.

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:33.338
IT ALSO HAS A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT

00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:34.772
WHEN REPLACES DIESEL IS

00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:35.940
TRANSPORTATION FEEL.

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:38.376
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE FIFTY MILLION

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:39.410
GALLONS.

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:40.945
EXCUSE ME DIESEL GALA QUOTE ONCE

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:42.013
ARE GONNA BE PRODUCED BY JERRY

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.584
BIO DIED JESTERS.

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:47.752
IN THE NEAR TERM.

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.187
USING THAT AND HEAVY DUTY

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:50.155
FREIGHT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR

00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:50.388
DIESEL.

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:53.658
WILL REDUCE EMISSIONS OF KNOX BY

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:55.093
ELEVEN HUNDRED TONS PER YEAR.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.694
ABOUT THREE TONS PER DAY IT'S

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:58.830
HUGE IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:00.698
THAT'S THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:01.866
OF BY A METHANE.

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:03.468
NOT FOR REPLACEMENT OF NATURAL

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:05.136
GAS AND HOMES BUILDINGS ARE

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:06.704
BUSINESSES.

OF A RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND

00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:55.853
HOW THAT COULD BE INNER

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.022
