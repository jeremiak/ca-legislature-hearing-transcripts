BACK TO WORK WITH THE CHILDREN

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:53.271
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN IT EVEN

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:54.505
THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES ARE

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:55.940
PEOPLE AT THE HIGH RISK

HOMELESS AND I MIGHT SOME THAT

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:18.863
PEOPLE WILL THIS IS A WITH BUT

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.367
THAT WHAT WHO ARE HOMELESS WITH

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.702
MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTIONS

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:27.572
AND ACCESS TO TREATMENT IS VERY

00:33:27.638 --> 00:33:29.874
COMPLEX AS YOU POINTED OUT IT'S

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:31.843
NOT EASY I CAN TELL YOU IN

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:34.045
ORANGE COUNTY JUST LIKE ANY

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:37.014
OTHER COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:39.283
INDIVIDUAL WHO HAVE SEVERE

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.219
MENTAL ILLNESS ON THE STREET

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:44.889
I'M NOT STRANGER TO US. HEALTH

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:47.558
SYSTEM WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE WE

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:49.660
HAVE TRIED YEARS FOR YEARS TO

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:52.697
ENGAGE THEM INTO TREATMENT BUT-

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:54.699
IN OUR COUNTRY THE RIGHT TO

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.868
REFUSE TREATMENT. IT IS THE

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:59.270
FUNDAMENTAL. AND I'M IN MY

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:01.939
OPINION THAT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:03.107
IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:04.942
CHALLENGE FOR US TO ENGAGE

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:07.478
PEOPLE IN TREATMENT- ESPECIALLY

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:09.447
WHEN THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:12.083
THEIR- EPISODE WHETHER IT BE

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.452
SEVERE MANIA ARE SEVERE

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:16.988
PSYCHOSIS- IS THAT THERE'S NOT

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:19.157
THAT RECOGNITION THAT TREATMENT

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:21.225
IS IMPORTANT FOR THAT BRACKET.

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:23.861
AND SO YES WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:25.563
IN ORANGE COUNTY I'M SO PROUD

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.532
OF THE PARTNERS IN THE PANEL

00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:29.700

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:33.037
DECADES. TO TRY TO GET HOUSING

COUNTY IT'S NOT A PERFECT PLACE

00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:44.282
FOR US TO DO THAT. IT IS VERY

00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:46.751
EXPENSIVE AND YOU CAN'T DO IT

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:49.220
RIGHT AND I KNOW WE HAVE GOTTEN

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:51.088
COOPERATION AND PARTNERSHIP

00:34:51.155 --> 00:34:52.957

MORE PEOPLE AT RISK OF

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:17.682
HOMELESSNESS SO COMPOUNDED BY

ARE MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.871
SHOWN THIS. WHEN THE FAMILY AN

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:10.774

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.256
TWO OF OUR CHILDREN WERE ON THE

00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:47.678
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND MORE

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:50.114
IMPORTANTLY MENTAL HEALTH

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:50.681
OUTCOMES FOR THE HOMELESS IN

00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:54.751
ORANGE COUNTY. MUCH HAS BEEN

00:45:54.818 --> 00:45:56.186
ACCOMPLISHED. BUT THERE'S MUCH

00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:59.223
MORE TO DO. IN ORANGE COUNTY WE

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:00.991
DON'T HAVE OUTREACH WORKERS

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:01.525
CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS TO

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:04.194
SERVICES. WE'RE ALSO PILOTING

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:06.130
PROGRAMS APPEAR A CLINICIAN AND

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:08.699
APPEAR TO RESPOND TO MENTAL

00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:09.266
HEALTH GOALS RATHER THAN ONE

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:12.603
FORSMAN. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:14.538
OF DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT ON

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.807
HOUSING FIRST INITIATIVES. AND

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:18.876
THE BE WELL SITE IN ORANGE IS

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:21.512
IN FULL OPERATION. BUT THE

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:24.081
ESSENCE OF PREVENTION IS

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:24.515
EDUCATION AND EARLY

00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:29.253
INTERVENTION. WE'RE THE SYSTEM

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:32.823
FALLS DOWN IS AFTER THE CRISIS.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.423
INDIVIDUALS STABILIZE BUT WHAT

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:36.994
THEN. WE DO NOT HAVE WARM HAND

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.929
OFFS OFTEN NOT HOMELESS

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:40.764
INDIVIDUAL HAS NO ALTERNATIVE

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:43.600
BUT THE STREETS. THERE IS NO

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:46.803
OFTEN NO ROOM AT THE END. WHEN

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.305
OUR SON DIED HE WAS DISCHARGED

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.774
FROM A PSYCHIATRIC UNIT DOSED

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:51.208
WITH THE COCKTAIL OF

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:53.577
MEDICATIONS. THE CLOTHES ON HIS

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:56.613
BACK. SOME PRESCRIPTIONS AND IT

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.714
WAS PASSED WITH THE INSTRUCTION

00:46:57.781 --> 00:46:58.582
TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.951
DEPARTMENT IF YOU FELT SUICIDAL

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:03.420
OR HOMICIDAL. THREE HOURS LATER

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.722
HE WAS DEAD. THIS IS

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:08.692
UNACCEPTABLE. IN WORKING WITH

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:09.927
COLLEAGUES IN EUROPE I'VE

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:11.261
LEARNED THE TRUE NATURE OF

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:14.231
WRAPAROUND CARE. BRICKS AND

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:15.999
MORTAR OR A PART OF THE ANSWER.

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:17.568
BUT CONDITIONS HAVE TO GO WHERE

00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:20.537
THE PROBLEM LIES NOT WAIT FOR

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:21.038
DISASTER TO WIN ON THEIR

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:25.342
DOORSTEP. HOUSING AND THE RIGHT

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:27.477
KIND OF HOUSING IS CRITICAL.

00:47:27.544 --> 00:47:29.179
INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS HAVE

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:29.746
DIFFERENT NEEDS AT DIFFERENT

00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:33.584
STAGES. SOMETIMES IT IS BEHIND

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:34.151
A LOCKED DOOR FOR THEIR OWN

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:37.754
SAFETY. THEN MAYBE IN A NON

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:40.457
WALKED ENVIRONMENT. BETTER TO

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:42.659
STEP DOWN HOUSING. THEN IT MAY

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:46.430
BE A GROUP HOME OR WITH FAMILY

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:46.964
AND ISN'T THAT REALLY THE

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.067
ULTIMATE GOAL. WE NEED SERVICES

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:52.236
AND HOUSING AT ALL THE STAGES.

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:54.638
WE DON'T HAVE NEARLY ENOUGH.

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.206
THE ECONOMICS OF GROUP HOUSING

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:58.375
SIMPLY DON'T WORK AND YET THERE

00:47:58.442 --> 00:47:59.910
ARE FEWER AND FEWER MENTAL

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:01.912
HOSPITALS IN EUROPE EXACTLY

00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:03.513
BECAUSE THEY FOUND THAT THESE

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.416
OPTIONS WORK. HAVING THE

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.418
CONDITIONS GO TO THE INDIVIDUAL

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:10.454
AND PATIENT CENTERED CARE WORKS.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.423
M. INVOLVEMENT WORKS. THE COST

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.559
OF HOMELESSNESS IN WASTED WIVES

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:18.061
AS A NATIONAL STATE. ACOSTA

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:20.030
DOLLARS IS TREMENDOUS WE NEED

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:24.501
TO DO BETTER. HOUSING AT EACH

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:27.537
LEVEL OF CARE CASE MANAGEMENT

00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:26.129
PEOPLE SAY WHY DON'T YOU JUST

TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:30.233
INSINUATING THAT PEOPLE WHO

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.069
HAVE LOST FAMILY MEMBERS TO THE

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:33.837

NEVER TRIED TO DO THAT HAVE

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:37.841
NEVER TRIED TO MAKE

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:41.511

THAT SAY THINGS LIKE WELL

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.351
THAT'S GREAT ALL THESE

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:48.819
INTERVENTIONS YOU WANT BUT WE

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:49.419
DON'T WANT HIM IN OUR

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:51.321
NEIGHBORHOOD WE DON'T WANT HIM

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:52.756
IN OUR CITY AND WE DON'T WANT

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.825
TO MEN ARE COUNTY BECAUSE- THEY

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:58.195
BRING CRIME AND DRUGS AND- AND-

00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:01.064
WE JUST DON'T WANT TO HEAR.

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:02.065
WELL THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.400
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE FROM

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:05.535
ORANGE COUNTY ORIGINALLY ANYWAY.

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:07.471
SO MOST OF THEM HAVE FAMILY

00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:10.273
HERE. THEY HAVE FRIENDS HERE.

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.942
BOB THEY HAVE SERIOUS

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:14.044
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. BUT

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:17.981
AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE- AND

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:18.615
SO WE HAVE TO TREAT THEM AS OUR

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:21.118
OWN. AND THIS IS THIS IS ALL

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:25.222
PART OF A CONTINUUM OF CARE. SO

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:27.991
WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AS-

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:31.161
WHERE DO WE WORK WE- ENGAGE

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:35.132
PEOPLE WHERE WE HAVE THEM. BOB

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.968
GETTING SERVICES AND AS I AM AS

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:39.703
I MENTIONED IN EUROPE B.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.838
CLINICIANS OFTEN GO TO THE

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:44.040
INDIVIDUAL. AND THAT'S NOT

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:46.243
CHEAP BUT WE HAVE TO BALANCE

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:48.445
THE COST OF DOING THAT VERSUS

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:51.314
THE COSTS OF INCARCERATION AND

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:54.351
BOB. HOSPITALIZATION AND THE

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:56.353
COST IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS SO

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.488
WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AS

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:02.259
A HOLISTIC OUR SYSTEM. AND I

00:51:02.325 --> 00:51:04.961
DON'T THINK WE DO GET. AND I DO

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.696
APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AS I

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:08.865
DO THINK ORANGE COUNTY DOES

00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:10.634
HAVE MANY MODELS THAT ARE BEST

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.469
PRACTICE MODELS AND WHERE WE

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:15.472
HAVE I THINK HAVE SOME. VERY

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:18.141
BRIGHT STARS I KNOW THAT MANY

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:20.510
MANY IF NOT ALL CITIES WHOSE

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:22.312
SOME INDIVIDUAL HOMES THAT WE

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.080
REALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT

00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:25.916
BECAUSE OF COURSE WE WANT TO

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:28.018
KEEP. THOSE HOMES PRIVATE

00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:30.454
WHETHER IT'S FOR ABUSED WOMEN

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.855
WHETHER THEY'RE SHELTERS FOR

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:33.757
FAMILY AND WHETHER THEIR GROUP

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:35.792
HOMES BECAUSE WE KNOW. IT TOO

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:37.961
OFTEN IF THESE HOMES ARE PUT ON

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:40.430
A LIST- SOMETIMES FOR NO

00:51:40.497 --> 00:51:42.532
APPARENT REASON OTHER THAN

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.700
PEOPLE DON'T WANT THAT TYPE OF

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.869
HOMES. IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:47.804
THEY COULD BE AT RISK OF BEING

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:50.207
SHUT DOWN. ON THE OTHER HAND WE

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:52.175
CERTAINLY KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:54.277
ISSUES WITH SOME GROUP HOMES

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:56.713
NOT BEING REGULATED- AND THIS

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.216
IS ALSO CAUSED- THE TIDE TO

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:00.517
TURN AGAINST SOME OF THE

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.886
SUPPORTIVE. SERVICES WHEN WE

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:05.222
HAVE BAD ACTORS SO THERE HAS TO

00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:06.823
BE A BALANCE BUT I CERTAINLY

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:10.026
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. I IF

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:12.062
YOU COULD PUT A PHONE NUMBER IN

THERE FOR AGAIN I'M LOOKING AT

BEING ABLE TO GET FAMILIES

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:19.069

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:31.474
HOURS AT A TIME- IN THE SIX

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.176
MONTHS AFTER KIDS GRADUATE FROM

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:34.544
THE PROGRAM WE'VE SEEN LESS

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.479
THAN 1% OF THEM GET RE ADMITTED

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:37.947

PROGRAM THAT WORKS. AND ALSO TO

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:41.117

KIDS WITH MEDICAL DISORDERS AND

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.791
PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS- WE'VE

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.326
SEEN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:51.227
MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:52.028
PARTICULARLY IN EATING

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:53.829
DISORDERS- AND WE'VE HAD SOME

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.198
GOOD SUCCESS THERE SO THERE ARE

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:57.033
PROGRAMS OUT THERE. THAT'S JUST

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.334
A SMALL SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.268
HAPPENING THE CHOCOLATE

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.671
WONDERFUL PROGRAMS HAPPENING

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:04.106
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY- SO THERE

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.108
IS GOOD NEWS IN ALL OF THIS. IN

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:07.109
TERMS OF NEEDS FOR THE

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.444
COMMUNITY THE I JUST WANT TO

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.613
HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS-

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.381
WE DO HAVE A NEED FOR

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:12.982
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:15.885
OUTPATIENT CARE- I KNOW WITH

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.119
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE'S

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:18.988
MONEY- GOING TO CHILDREN'S.

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.923
HEALTH CARE AT CHILDREN'S

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.192
MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR SCHOOL-

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:24.927
I THINK THAT IDEA OF WHAT'S-

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:26.662
WHERE WHERE WHERE KIDS ARE AND

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.631
LET'S BE SURE THAT WE HAVE A

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:29.465
HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL OF CARE

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:32.034
AVAILABLE- I THINK OF A VERY

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.703
IMPORTANT PART FOR THAT MONEY

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:35.004
TO COME TO ORANGE COUNTY AND

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:37.607
BEAT. RB SPENCER- IN IN THAT

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:38.808
WAY AND EXPANDING THOSE

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:40.676
OUTPATIENT CARE OPPORTUNITIES

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:41.944
THAT COLLABORATION WITH

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:45.681
PEDIATRICIANS. WERE NEVER GONNA

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:46.215
HAVE ENOUGH CHILD AN ADULT

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:47.283
ESSENCE LIKE HYATT. OUT WE ONLY

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.952
HAVE THOUSAND IN THE ENTIRE- SO

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:51.654
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO RAMP

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.423
UP BUT WE CAN. LEVERAGE OUR

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.058
PEDIATRICIANS IF THEY HAVE

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:57.893
SUPPORT AND CARE SO. I'M

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.629
CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THOSE

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:01.631
KINDS OF CONSULTATION LINES OUT

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.566
WOULD BE IMPORTANT-

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:05.167
UNFORTUNATELY INTENSIVE

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:08.771
OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS- ARE NOT.

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.640
PAID FOR BY MEDICAID HOW AT

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:12.842
THIS POINT IN TIME- IT SO I

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:14.243
THINK IF WE COULD EXPAND THE

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.647
SERVICES- TO INCLUDE I. THE

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:18.581

PROGRAMS WHICH WE KNOW OUR

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.953
SUCCESSFUL- AND I THINK WE

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:24.954
COULD USE SOME OF THE MONEY

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:26.856
THAT'S COMING OUT FOR EVIDENCE

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:28.858
BASED PROGRAMS. TO PROVIDE

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:30.926

SCHOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT AS

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:39.068
THAT MONEY'S GOING INTO THE

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.037
SCHOOLS. FOR MENTAL HEALTH THAT

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.672

THINGS THAT WE KNOW WORK RATHER

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.344

TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE KNOW IS

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:40.576
ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE USING NOW

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.811
AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHO WE ARE

01:09:42.878 --> 01:09:45.648
AND HOW WE OPERATE. BUT IT IS A

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.517
VERY LOUD NOISE WHEN KIDS ARE

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:51.053
USING IT WITHOUT ANY CONTROLS

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.923
WE KNOW THAT THE LIGHTS ARE FOR

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:57.092

GROUPS THAT THEY CAN GO TO KIND

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:18.180
OF MOVE AWAY FROM SOME OF THAT

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:23.218
JUST CHATTERING NOISE. I THINK

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:23.786
IS GOING TO START TO PUT THE

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:24.853
BACK INTO SPACE WHERE THEY CAN

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.488
UP CALM THE BRAIN DOWN IF YOU

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:23.799
HER BACK HOME AND TO HELP

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.333
PATIENTS PROGRAM AND COMMUNITY.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.103
AND THE THIRD PATIENT WAS- BUT

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.806
COMMERCIALLY INSURED YOUNG MAN

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:31.673
TWENTY TWO HAVING HIS FIRST

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.575
PSYCHOTIC BREAK OVER AT ANOTHER

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:36.011
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT- BECAUSE

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:37.479
WE HAD ALREADY TRAINED THAT E.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.480
R. WE WERE ABLE TO MEDICALLY

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.415
CLEAR HIM. VERY QUICKLY GET

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:42.484
OVER TO THE CAMPUS AND HIS

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.786
FIRST WORDS UPON ARRIVAL WORK

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.955
WELL I THINK I COULD BREATHE.

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:48.223
SO EVEN IN THE MIDST OF A FIRST

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:49.691
PSYCHIATRIC BREAK NEW THE

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:50.959
DIFFERENCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.027
HE WAS IN AN EMERGENCY

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:53.562
DEPARTMENT. VERSUS THE

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:56.364
ENVIRONMENT OF THIS- HIGH

01:18:56.431 --> 01:18:58.266
QUALITY CLINICAL CARE FACILITY

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.168
AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET HIM

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:01.736
INTO THE CARE NEEDED. THE

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:03.839
REASON I HIGHLIGHT THOSE THOSE

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:05.774
THREE PATIENTS- IS BECAUSE IT

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.609
SPEAKS TO WHAT'S POSSIBLE WITH

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:10.545
COLLABORATION. SO ONE OF THE

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:11.913
HOSPITALS WOULD HAVE A VERY

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.349
DIFFICULT TIME TREATING ALL

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.817
THREE OF THOSE PEOPLE ACROSS

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:16.985
ALL THREE OF THOSE DIFFERENT

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:18.954
HAIR TYPES. ALL THREE OF THOSE

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.222
DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.290
SITUATIONS AND ALL THREE OF

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:24.292
THOSE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS.

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:27.262
BUT BECAUSE THE COUNTY ALABAMA

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:28.830
THE HOSPITAL'S ALL DID THIS

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.832
TOGETHER WE WERE ABLE TO CARE

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:32.167
FOR ALL THREE OF THOSE PEOPLE

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:34.102
IN THE SAME PLACE NO QUESTIONS

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:35.937
ASKED BRING THEM IN AND WRAPPED

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.839
A HOPELESS SUPPORT AROUND. SO

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:40.375
TO ME THAT START SPEAKING TO

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.077
THE TOPIC THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:44.212
FOR US TODAY. OF THE INTEGRATED

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:47.149
COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. AND AND

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:49.351
THE NECESSITY OF BRINGING

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.386
COMMUNITY AND A COMMUNITY OF

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:54.389
CARE PROVIDERS BETTER TOGETHER

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.091
TO CREATE SYSTEMS OF CARE THAT

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.159
ARE MORE INTEGRATED AND

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:59.661
HOLISTIC. AND I REALLY LIKED-

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:01.663
MR HOLTZMAN'S COMMENTS ON THAT

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:07.135
HOLISTIC INTEGRATED CONTINUUM'S.

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:10.672
OF CARE AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:12.674
ALL RIGHT A HIGHLIGHT A LITTLE-

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.943
PIECE AT. IN OUR SYSTEM NOW AND

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:17.245
THAT IS WE HAVE FRAGMENTATION

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.147
WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:21.850
ITSELF. WE HAVE FRAGMENTATION

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.618
WITHIN THE HOMELESS SERVICES

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:25.987
SOLUTION ITSELF. AND BURN

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:28.890
REGRETTABLY OFTENTIMES THE

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:31.693
TUESDAY BROWN'S- POOR ATTEMPTS

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.329
AT SYSTEMS ARE NOT INTEGRATED

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:37.332
NEARLY ENOUGH- THE FUNDING

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:38.767
STREAMS OFTENTIMES KEEP

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:40.735
SEPARATE EFFORTS FUNDING

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:42.537
STREAMS OFTENTIMES CREATE

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:44.472
COMPETITION AND FRAGMENTATION

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:46.474
OF INSTEAD OF COLLABORATION AND

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.977
CONNECTIVITY AND SO THERE'S

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:52.280
SOME REAL OPPORTUNITY THERE- IN

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.449
THE LAST- IN THE LAST PLANE

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:57.752
PLANE CAL- OR AT LEAST FOR THE

01:20:57.819 --> 01:20:58.353
TWENTY NINETEEN POINT IN TIME

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.288
COUNT I THAT I HAVE IN FRONT OF

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.557
ME- WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.926
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ENTERED

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:07.963
HOMELESSNESS- AT THAT POINT IN

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:09.798
TIME COUNT IN TWENTY NINETEEN.

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:12.300
IT WAS UP ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:14.269
HUNDRED PEOPLE ENTERED INTO

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.838
HOMELESSNESS. AND WHEN WE LOOK

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:18.873
AT WHO EXITED HOMELESSNESS

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:22.077
INTO- GOING BACK HOME OR INTO

01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:23.445
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:26.181
INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT WAS

01:21:26.248 --> 01:21:28.383
AROUND ROUGHLY SEVENTEEN

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.684
HUNDRED. SO MUCH MORE GOING

01:21:29.751 --> 01:21:32.287
INTO HOMELESSNESS THEN WE HAD

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:34.889
GOING OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. AND

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.358
THE OTHER THING I THINK TO NOTE

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:38.159
IS THAT AMONG THOSE GOING INTO

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:41.129
HOMELESSNESS ONLY 40%

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:55.877
IDENTIFIED ECONOMIC REASONS. SO

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:59.080
IF WE HAVE 60% OF THE DRIVERS

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:00.115
AND THE HOMELESSNESS IS MENTAL

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:02.050
HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE AND THE

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:03.551
NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOING INTO

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.920
HOMELESSNESS FAR OUTSTRIPPING

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:06.488
THE NUMBER THAT ARE EXITING

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:08.757
HOMELESSNESS AND WE'VE GOT SOME

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:11.026
REAL NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:13.128
BETTER WEAVE TOGETHER THE

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:15.230
SYSTEM OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:15.964
AND THE SYSTEM OF HOMELESS

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:17.732
SERVICE SOLUTIONS AND WE'RE

01:22:17.799 --> 01:22:20.068
GONNA NEED A WHOLE COMMUNITY

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:22.337
EFFORT TO PULL THAT OFF-

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:24.139
OBVIOUSLY. NOT EVERYBODY THAT

01:22:24.205 --> 01:22:26.241
IS HOMELESS IS MENTALLY ILL AND

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:27.776
NOT EVERYBODY WAS MENTALLY ILL

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:30.412
IS OMELESS- BUT THE NUMBERS

01:22:30.478 --> 01:22:33.882
ARE- ARE STRONG ENOUGH SUCH

01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:34.749
THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:36.451
OVERLAP. BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:39.020
REAL INTENTIONAL ABOUT BRINGING

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:41.990
THESE SYSTEMS TOGETHER. SO A

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:45.460
COUPLE OF- OF SORT OF SPECIFIC

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:48.063
NEEDS I THINK- AGAIN FOLLOWING

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.931
HEATHER'S LEAD I THINK WE HAVE

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:52.334
OPPORTUNITIES WHEN IT COMES TO

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.135
LOOKING AT THAT STATE FUNDING.

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:56.738
OF THAT OFTENTIMES RUNS THROUGH

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:58.573
A COUNTY CHANNEL WE HAVE

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.041
OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THAT

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:03.178
FUNDING- TO INCENTIVIZE

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:05.980
COLLABORATION AND CONNECTIVITY

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:08.616
AND INTEGRATION. BECAUSE

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.151
INADVERTENTLY SOMETIMES THOSE

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:12.721
FUNDING STREAMS DR COMPETITION

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:15.724
AND FRAGMENTATION- AMONGST A

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.992
GROUP OF CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:22.497
LARGELY- BY DNA DESIGN LOOKING

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:22.964
FOR COLLABORATION AND

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:25.266
CONNECTIVITY- BUT OFTENTIMES

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.901
FUNDING STREAMS BECAUSE

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:27.736
COMPETITION AND THAT

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:29.571
SEPARATION. SO I WOULD CALL

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:31.039
THAT OUT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.507
US IN CALIFORNIA AND IN ORANGE

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:34.476
COUNTY TO LOOK AT OUR FUNDING

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:36.211
STREAMS AS OPPORTUNITIES. TO

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:39.948
LEVERAGE- AND INCENTIVIZE

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:41.082
PARTNERSHIP AND INTEGRATION. OF

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:42.350
THE OTHER THING I JUST THAT

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:44.252
CAUGHT MY ATTENTION OF THAT

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:46.488
DOCTOR CHAO WAS COMMENTING ON

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:48.656
IS- THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:50.792
ILLNESSES THEMSELVES. AND SO WE

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:51.993
JUST TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:52.861
THE SYSTEM AND THE

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:54.229
FRAGMENTATION THERE HOW WE

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.797
MIGHT ADDRESS SOME THINGS TO

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.232
BRING INTEGRATION BUT THEN

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:58.266
THERE'S THE CHALLENGES OF THE

01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:02.237
ILLNESSES THEMSELVES. AND AND

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:04.906
THERE IS A STRANGE QUALITY TO

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:06.641
THE ILLNESSES OF SUBSTANCE USE

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.710
AND MENTAL- MENTAL ILLNESSES

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:10.612
WHERE IN THE PERSON SUFFERING

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:13.782
OFTENTIMES IS THE LAST IN LINE

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.683
TO REALIZE THE DEGREE TO WHICH

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:16.618
THEY'RE STRUGGLING AND

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.420
SUFFERING AND OFTENTIMES IT'S

01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:20.688
THE ILLNESS ITSELF. THAT

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:21.556
PREVENTS THEM FROM ENGAGING IN

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:23.558
CARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THAN

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:24.826
OTHER MEDICAL ILLNESSES

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.194
SOMEBODY A GETS A CANCER

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.729
DIAGNOSIS TODAY THERE AT THE

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.397
FRONT OF THE LINE SAYING YES

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:30.632
PLEASE SIGN ME UP GET ME INTO

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:31.332
THE BEST CARE PROVIDER

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:33.802
POSSIBLE- THE PERSON STRUGGLING

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:36.104
WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA OR A SEVERE

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:38.306
ADDICTION. OFTENTIMES IT TAKES

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.141
MANY MANY MANY TIMES OF

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:42.076
ENGAGEMENT TO GET THEM TO SEE

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:43.178
THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:45.880
ILLNESS AND AGREED TO CARE. AND

01:24:45.947 --> 01:24:47.282
SO I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSCORE

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:48.450
SOMETHING DOCTOR CHANNEL

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:50.618
MENTIONED WITH REGARDS TO-

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:52.854
POLICY CHANGE IN REGULATION

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:55.190

DESIGNED TO PROTECT PEOPLES-

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:01.396
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WHICH IS

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:03.064
CLEARLY A VERY IMPORTANT THING.

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:04.799
CAN ALSO INADVERTENTLY

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:07.535
INTERFERE WITH A COMMUNITY OF

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.070
CARE PROVIDERS BEING ABLE TO DO

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:11.306
WHAT'S CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:13.675
FOR A PERSON IN NEED- OF A

01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:16.077
STORY THAT- THAT THAT STRUCK ME

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:17.779
ECENTLY AND I- HERE THESE

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:19.781
STORIES ALL THE TIME- EVERYDAY

OF MY LIFE IN FACT- A FAMILY

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:23.318
MEMBER CALLED ME A FEW WEEKS

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:26.688
AGO. BECAUSE THERE- A TEENAGER

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:29.657
WAS- PSYCHOTIC IN THE PARK-

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:32.594
pHAD BEEN LIVING IN THE BUSHES

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:36.164
IN THE PARK- FOR MANY DAYS- THE

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:37.532
CARE PROVIDER TEAMS THAT ARE

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:42.237
AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:43.137
WENT OUT AND WENT AND GAVE EACH

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:44.272
THE YOUNG MAN- HE WAS A TO PULL

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:45.940
THE ENOUGH TO SAY OH NO I'M

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:46.841
GONNA GO GET A SANDWICH AND

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:47.642

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:51.412
TOGETHER FOR THE SIXTY SECOND.

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:53.481
NINETY SECOND INTERACTION-

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:54.749
SUFFICIENT TO SAY THERE'S NO

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:56.451

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:06.694
THERE IS- SOMETHING HERE ON THE

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.863

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.510
WHAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE

MENTIONED WHERE IS IF IN

01:29:10.845 --> 01:29:12.847
INDIVIDUAL TRIES TO ATTAIN THE

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND YET

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:18.119
THEY HAVE AN ADDICTION- THE LAW

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:21.522
WAS UNCLEAR OF CAN. MENTAL

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:23.558
HEALTH FUNDS BE USED FOR CO

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:25.326

HEALTH THEY CAN BE TREATED I

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:40.441
AND BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE HAVE

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:42.176
BEEN POINTS WHERE IF YOU'RE

01:29:42.243 --> 01:29:44.011
HAVE AN ADDICTION NO YOU NEED

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:45.446

OVER THERE. AND THAT IS AN

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:51.052
EXTREMELY A DIFFICULT A

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:52.687
SCENARIO FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.789
ARE STRUGGLING AND THEN IF YOU

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.791
ADD ON TO THAT SOMETIMES

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:59.026
ANOTHER OCCURRING A CONDITION

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:00.261
WHICH COULD BE A PHYSICAL

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:02.163
CONDITION SOME PEOPLE

01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:07.135
CONDITIONS AT THE SAME TIME.

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:09.437
AND THEN ADD EVEN MORE TO THAT

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:11.439
WITH WHICH MA BE VERY LITTLE

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:12.874
RESOURCES TO GET AROUND THE

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:16.444
COUNTY FROM TRANSPORTATION- TO

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:18.946
VERY LITTLE RESOURCES FROM

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:21.482
ACTUALLY HAVING- DOLLARS IN

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:23.417
THEIR POCKET POCKET TO HOP ON A

BUS TO GET A NEW WORD TO GET TO

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:26.921
THESE APPOINTMENTS. SO WHEN

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:28.656
WEEKEND HOUSE SOME OF THESE

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:31.526
SERVICES UNDER ONE UMBRELLA IN

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:33.494
ONE BUILDING EVEN MAKE THESE

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:35.062
APPOINTMENTS THAT THEY'RE NOT

GOING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:39.700
BUT NOW EVEN WITH IF ANYTHING

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:42.537
IS A SILVER LINING IS A THROUGH

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:44.105
THE PANDEMIC IS THESE VIRTUAL

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:46.607

POSSIBLY BEING ABLE TO ATTEND-

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:50.845

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:53.381
COULD HELP A VIRTUALLY ACT-

01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:55.116
WHETHER IT'S EVEN THE HOUSING

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:56.684
PLACE THAT THEY'RE AT SO

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:58.152

THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY YEP TO

APPOINTMENT TO APPOINTMENT AND

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:03.724
FOR SOME OF THEM THE TOLERANCE

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:05.459
IS VERY LITTLE AND WE LOSE THEM

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:08.996

HOMELESSNESS IN ORANGE COUNTY

02:14:32.197 --> 02:14:35.700
AND NOW OTHER AREAS LOS ANGELES.

02:14:35.767 --> 02:14:38.103
THE CITY HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO

02:14:38.170 --> 02:14:39.504
OR THAT I SHOULD SAY THE COUNTY

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:41.540
AND TO THREE SERVICE PROVIDER

02:14:41.606 --> 02:14:44.443
AREA SPOT AREAS NORTH ORANGE

02:14:44.509 --> 02:14:46.144
COUNTY WHICH STANTON IT

02:14:46.211 --> 02:14:48.413
INCLUDES ALSO INCLUDES I'M NOT

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:50.382
GONNA LIST- BUT TEN CITIES OR

02:14:50.449 --> 02:14:53.785
TWELVE. HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:57.689
PUT- WHETHER IT'S THE HOME KEY

02:14:57.756 --> 02:14:59.724
PROJECTS IN STANTON WHETHER

02:14:59.791 --> 02:15:01.693
IT'S THE A HOMELESS SHELTER AND

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:03.028
ONE OF PARK WHETHER IT'S

02:15:03.094 --> 02:15:04.396
ELIMINATION FOUNDATION

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:06.398
RECUPERATIVE CENTER IN

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:08.467
FULLERTON PLACENTIA WITH

02:15:08.533 --> 02:15:10.101
ANOTHER HOMELESS SHELTER AND

02:15:10.168 --> 02:15:12.003
VETERANS HOUSING ALL OF THESE

02:15:12.070 --> 02:15:13.472
MODELS AND FOR SOME OF THE

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:15.307
SMALLER CITIES WHO AREN'T

02:15:15.373 --> 02:15:17.242
HOSTING SITES THEY ARE ACTUALLY

02:15:17.309 --> 02:15:20.212
PUTTING IN FUNDS. BUT I WOULD

02:15:20.278 --> 02:15:22.347
BE REMISS IF I DID NOT SAY THAT

02:15:22.414 --> 02:15:24.316
EVERY CITY NEEDS TO BE DOING

02:15:24.382 --> 02:15:26.818
SOMETHING GIVING DOLLARS TO US

02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:28.887
PAUL AREA IS GREAT BUT THE

02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:31.089
CITIES THAT ARE HOSTING THOSE

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:34.059
AREAS. IT IS A DRAIN ON THEIR

02:15:34.125 --> 02:15:35.760
SERVICES AS YOU WELL KNOW MAYOR

02:15:35.827 --> 02:15:38.330
SHAWVER WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE

02:15:38.396 --> 02:15:40.499
THAT ARE COMING INTO YOUR CITY

02:15:40.565 --> 02:15:42.367
FOR CITY OF FOR SERVICES

02:15:42.434 --> 02:15:43.802
WHETHER THE WRAPAROUND

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:47.072
RECUPERATIVE- THIS TAKES UP

02:15:47.138 --> 02:15:48.840
QUITE A BIT OF POLICE TIME IT

02:15:48.907 --> 02:15:50.742
TAKES QUITE A BIT OF TIME FROM

02:15:50.809 --> 02:15:53.178
PARKS AND RECREATION FROM THE

02:15:53.245 --> 02:15:54.479
LOCAL CITIES THAT ARE HOSTING

02:15:54.546 --> 02:15:56.348
THEM. AND SO THIS WOULD BE MY

02:15:56.414 --> 02:15:58.316
PLEA I KNOW IT IS NOT POPULAR

02:15:58.383 --> 02:16:00.519
BELIEVE ME I KNOW WHAT IS NOT

02:16:00.585 --> 02:16:03.188
POPULAR BUT EVERY CITY NEEDS TO

02:16:03.255 --> 02:16:06.458
DO SOMETHING EVERY CITY NEEDS

02:16:06.525 --> 02:16:08.994
TO BE HOSTING SOMETHING UP AND

02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:11.596
AGAIN IF WE ALL DID SOMETHING

02:16:11.663 --> 02:16:13.565
IN IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE

02:16:13.632 --> 02:16:15.534
POPULATION SIZE OF THE CITY.

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:16.968
CERTAINLY LA PALMA IS THE POP

02:16:17.035 --> 02:16:18.937
SMALLER CITY IN MY DISTRICT

02:16:19.004 --> 02:16:20.672
THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING WHAT

02:16:20.739 --> 02:16:22.374
FULLER THàNH DOES WHICH IS THE

02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:24.376
LARGEST PART BUT IF EVERYBODY

02:16:24.442 --> 02:16:26.111
DOES SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE

02:16:26.177 --> 02:16:29.447
HAVE THE ABILITY TO TACKLE THIS

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:31.716
AND- EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SOME

02:16:31.783 --> 02:16:35.720

OVERWHELMED THAT YEAR WE WERE

02:23:43.748 --> 02:23:46.351

PRETTY MUCH SUMMARIZES- THE

02:23:59.163 --> 02:24:01.766
RESPONSE THAT THEY GOT AND SO.

02:24:01.833 --> 02:24:04.035
ON IN OCTOBER BECAUSE OF MANY

02:24:04.102 --> 02:24:06.137
FACTORS BUT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

02:24:06.204 --> 02:24:06.604
