HEARING THE CHANGING. ELECTRICITY LANDSCAPE THE NEED FOR NEW REGULATORY APPROACH -- BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING -- RECENTLY WITH -- IN THE ENERGY. INDUSTRY. AND OF COURSE AND AND THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL -- THIS IS OUR THIRD HERE IN. IN IN THREE WEEKS AND TODAY -- WE WANNA TAKE IT UP. AN OPPORTUNITY GET MORE INFORMATION AND AND IN THIS AREA. THIS IS A A FOLLOW UP TO A SIMILAR HEARING WE HAD. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. ON AUGUST OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE HEAT THE HEARING FOCUSED ON THE GROWTH OF CUT COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE UTILITY SURVEY IN. THE ENERGY LOW. TO PROVIDE A SENSE OF THE PACE OF CHANGE AT THE TIME OF THAT HEARING -- THERE WERE EIGHT CCA'S LAUNCHED OR PREPARING TO LAUNCH TO SERVE THE ENERGY LOAD ACROSS OUR STATE OR FOR ABOUT -- ONE MILLION CUSTOMERS. A ROMAN IN THE DIRECT ACCESS PROGRAM REMAINED. CAPT AND THE STATE WAS IN THE MIDST OF IMPLEMENTING SB -- THREE FIFTY RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD GOALS. A YEAR AND A HALF LATER NINETEEN CCA'S LAUNCHED SURVEY IN ABOUT TEN MILLION CUSTOMERS. AND DOZENS MORE ARE PREPARING TO LAUNCH. THE CAPTAIN SHOULD THE CAP ON DIRECT ASK ACCESS WAS LIFTED. EVEN A EVEN IF MODESTLY. BUT THE LEGISLATION. ADOPTED LAST YEAR PRETTY MUCH -- CHANGE THAT. SB ONE HUNDRED HAS BEEN ADOPTED IT AS A IT HAS XCELERATED -- AND OF THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD AND AND ZERO CARBON RESOURCES GOAL BY BY -- TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND THIS IS ALSO PLATE HAVING A ROLE IN IN. IN AN INCREASE THE CCA'S ONE HAND AND INCREASE OUR SANDERS ANOTHER HOW DOES THAT. HOW DOES THAT WORK TOGETHER MAYBE TODAY WE CAN ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS FROM? EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. THE GOAL OF OUR HEARING TODAY IS IS REALLY TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS A SENSE OF THE CHALLENGES AND AND OPPORTUNITIES POSTED BY THE CHANGES IN THE ELECTRICITY LANDSCAPE. WE ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HEARING FROM SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE PROPOSING PARTICULAR CHANGES. TO THE REGULATORY APPROACH TODAY -- I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A CAUTION TO EVERYONE. WE WE HAVE A HARD STOP BEFORE ELEVEN THIS MORNING WE HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT -- HEARING IN THE SENATE AT ELEVEN SO WE WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA TRY -- TO GIVE UP PEOPLE'S COMMENTS AS TESTIMONY BEFORE ELEVEN BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS WERE STOPPING AT ELEVEN TODAY. UNFORTUNATELY -- BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CONSTRAINTS OF TODAY'S CALENDAR. AND WE HAVE A A VERY AND VICIOUS SET OF OF MEETINGS TODAY THAT WE'RE GONNA HOPE TO ATTEND ALL AT THE TEND TO YOU KNOW -- AGAIN -- DUE TO THE LIMITED TIME WE HAVE A LITERAL NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS WHO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE MANY MORE PERSPECTIVES -- MANY MORE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE HAVE A VERY LIMITED WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY HERE THAT WE INTENDED. TO SEIZE -- I HOPE -- THAT WE WE FOCUS. ON THE PERSPECTIVE OF LOAD SERVING ENTITIES A UTILITIES CCA'S AND YES PLEASE AND OF COURSE TURN. IS HERE AS WELL -- WE WILL BE HEARING TODAY FROM -- PRESIDENT THE KID THE PC ONCE AGAIN MICHAEL PICKER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND ALSO -- THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA PC -- EDWARD WENT FRIEND OFFICE HERE'S WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION LATER WE WILL HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDER -- STAKEHOLDERS -- IN PROVIDING THE THEIR PERSPECTIVES. FONG **** THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT ENERGY POLICY PROCUREMENT FOR PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. MATTHEW FRIEDMAN STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. DON WEIS PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD DIRECTORS HE'LL CLEAN ENERGY CALIFORNIA CHOICE. ASSOCIATION KENDALL HOME VICE PRESIDENT AND YOUR SUPPLY CENTER GAS AND ELECTRIC RUN PERRY. PRESIDENT AND CEO OF COMMERCIAL ENERGY AND CALL IN QUESTION A VICE PRESIDENT OF ENERGY PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT -- THIS PRESIDENT. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I CAME TO SPEAK BEFORE LOW LEGISLATIVE BODIES LIKE THIS THE COP TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WAS WHAT WE CALLED THE DEATH SPIRAL OF THE ELECTRIC UTILITY DUE TO NET ENERGY METER -- SOLAR ROOF TOP. AT THIS POINT THAT MARKET IS FLATTENING AND IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A CONSIDERED TO BE A RISK TO THE TO THE INCUMBENT -- ELECTRIC UTILITIES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY USERS CAN GET THEIR POWER FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN THOSE TRADITIONAL -- I USE. INVESTOR IN UTILITIES THEY CAN THEY THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATTERNS BY WHICH PEOPLE CAN PROCURE ONE IS BY A RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT THE STATE HELPS TO FINANCE SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE A CHIU RANGE CHOICES AS TO HOW THEY GET THEIR ELECTRICITY FREQUENTLY ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY BEHIND THE METER. AND THEN THEIR BUSINESS MODELS FOR PROVIDERS WHO CAN ALSO COMPETE FOR SELLING ELECTRICITY. TO THOSE CUSTOMERS TERMS OF TECHNOLOGIES ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS ALWAYS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBABLY FOR QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY A COMBINED HEAT AND POWER WHICH IS A AN INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY PROCESS TO CAPTURE HE TURNED INTO STEAM TO MAKE COLLECTOR CITY THIS USED ON CIDER SOLD BACK TO THE ELECTRICITY UNDER. CONTRACT. ROOFTOP SOLAR YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT WAS HELPED BY A PARTICULAR FINANCING BUSINESS MODEL CALLED NET ENERGY METERING. I REQUIRES -- CUSTOMERS TO HAVE BOTH A GOOD ROOF AND A GOOD FIGHT GO SCORE I THINK IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOTH THE YOU ROOF THAT'S READY TO STAND UP TO TWENTY YEARS OF SOLAR PANELS. WITHOUT BEING REPLACED BECAUSE I MEAN YOU HAVE FICUS SCORES. BUT THERE'S ALSO BATTERY STORAGE CELLAR PLUS BATTERY AND FIRST A LOT OF SMALL INDUSTRIAL AND AND COMPUTER COMPANIES NATURAL GAS FUEL CELLS WHICH TO USE FOR A LIABILITY. THE BUSINESS MODELS INCLUDE DIRECT ACCESS WHICH GOES BACK TO THE DE REGULATION 220-002-0001. THE NEW COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS COR AND NOW CORPORATE PROCUREMENT WE SING LÃ  MANY LARGE COMPANIES WHO WILL BUY A GIGAWATT OF WIND IN ANOTHER STATE AND THEN PAID A WE'LL THEIR ELECTRICITY TO THEM OVER THE GRAD SO THERE'S A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PATTERNS ERODING. THIS CENTRAL PROCUREMENT DO WE USE TO SEE UP 2405% OF CUSTOMER DEMAND LOAD. IS DEPARTING FROM IT IS PROBABLY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. AS OF SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE THIRTY SEVEN LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PROVIDERS OF ELECTRICITY UNDER PSG JURISDICTION SERVING CUSTOMERS. COLLUDING THE THREE BIG I USED TO SMALLER WHEN. NINETEEN CLEAN COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS AND FOURTEEN ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS THOSE DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS TO GO BACK 220-002-0001 ENERGY CRISIS. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS NOT A DE REGULATION THAT WAS PLANNED? BY THE LEGISLATURE AND HAD CONSISTENCY BUT IT'S A DE REGULATION FROM THE GROUND UP AS A RESULT OF MANY CHANGES AND AND DECISIONS AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIONS OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. MY FEAR IS THAT UNLESS WE PUT SOME -- PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. OR COME UP WITH THE CONSISTENT MODEL THEN WE COULD DRIFT BACK INTO SOME OF THE SAME KINDS OF OF PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW. THOUSAND ONE WITH THAT DE REGULATION THAT WAS EASY FOR THE LEGISLATURE REVERSE THIS WILL BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE INVESTMENT MADE BY CUSTOMERS AND A WHOLE RANGE OF OF OTHER PATTERNS THAT ARE DEVELOPED. WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS FRAGMENTED DECISION MAKING WERE MANY INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS TONY UP TO ADD UP TO THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE -- WE'RE SEEING -- POORLY COORDINATED PROCUREMENT. THAT DOESN'T -- MAKE SURE THE SPECIFIC RESOURCES ARE IN PLACE TO PROVIDE RELIABILITY THE GRAD. AND THERE'S NO PLAN FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF FAILURE OF ANY THESE NEW PLAYERS. IN THE MARKET PLACE AS A RESULT OF TURBULENCE AND IN THE LARGER ELECTRICITY MARKETS AND OTHER KINDS OF ON TOWARD EVENTS. SO I A QUICKLY OUTLINED SOME OF WHAT WE SAW IS WE STUDIED OTHER STATES. AS WE STARTED TO SEE THIS PATTERN EMERGING NOT JUST IN ONE CASE BUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS TECHNOLOGIES TOGETHER. WE STARTED A STUDY WHICH WE CALL CALIFORNIA CUSTOMER CHOICE WE TRY TO BE AGNOSTIC AS TO THE TECHNOLOGY OR THE BUSINESS MODEL. BUT WE ARE SEEING SOME PATTERNS THE THAT WE THINK DESERVE ATTENTION -- AS PART OF THEIR PROJECT AGAIN WE LOOKED AT FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO EVALUATE THEIR DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OR OF A COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT HAVE ENABLED THEM TO HAVE A HIGH PENETRATION OF CUSTOMER CHOICE. IN ELECTRICITY SERVICE AND THAT'S JUST ELECTRICITY SERVICE IT DOES NOT -- AND GENERALLY INVOLVE THE IN THE A THEY DID NATURAL MONOPOLY OF WIRES AND POLES. YOU DO NOT HAVE CUSTOMERS YET OUT THERE WANTING TO OWN THEIR OLD WOODEN POLE. OR SEGMENT OF WIRE THAN CHARGING THEIR NEIGHBORS TO USE. THAT'S STILL A MONOPOLY. NONE OF THESE ARE EXACTLY IDENTICAL TO CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MUCH MORE PATTERNS. AND PROTECTIONS IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT ELECTRICITY IS AFFORDABLE TO ALL CUSTOMERS. WE ARE REALLY FOR OFF MUCH FURTHER DOWN THE PATHWAY OF D. CARBONIZATION OF THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY THAN OTHER STATES. AND WE HAVE BE BECAUSE OF LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION VERY FIRM AND FAST RULES ABOUT RELIABILITY CORD TO CALL RESOURCE ADEQUACY. SO IN NEW YORK. CUSTOMERS CAN ENTER INTO. AGREEMENTS WITH WITH ENERGY S. GOES. THEN THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THOSE COMPANIES SERVICE THERE WERE SEVENTY OF THEM AS OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT UNLIKE CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A SINGLE STATE AGENCY THAT DOES ALL THE PROCUREMENT NICER TO KNOW NEW YORK STATE -- ENERGY RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. AND THEY DO THEY DO PARTICULARLY THE CLEAN ENERGY PROCUREMENT. THE UTILITIES ONLY RUN THE WIRES AND POLES AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY SEPARATE THE BULK TRANSMISSION FROM THE LOW VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. MORE RECENTLY THEY'VE TRIED TO STIMULATE INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT WOULD COMPETE WITH SOME OF THOSE DISTRIBUTION SERVICES. SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE DOING HEARING CALIFORNIA -- HOWEVER THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL TRAILING I THINK SOME OF THE SUCCESSES WE'VE SEEN. SO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THEIR WORKS VERY WELL FOR LARGE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS THE RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL CUSTOMERS. IN KONA -- INCLUDING LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ARE ARE OVERPAYING ACCORDING TO WHAT WE FOUND. ILLINOIS' ILLINOIS' HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODEL THEY HAVE. A VERY LARGE INCUMBENT. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BUT THEY'VE ALLOWED COMMUNITIES TO CREATE WHAT THEY CALL A MUNICIPAL ENERGY AGGREGATORS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO OUR OUR CLEAN A COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS. EXCEPT YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH THAT HERE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHES THE THE MUNICIPAL -- ENERGY AGGREGATOR AND YOU ARE STUCK WITH IT FOR A YEAR -- THERE'S A RATE THE YOU HAVE TO BE THAT'S ACTUALLY -- BASED ON THE THE THE LECTURE CITY RATES SET BY ALL THE OTHER YOU. REGULATED UTILITIES. AND THAT WAY THE RETAIL PROVIDERS KNOW WHO THEY HAVE TO TO TO BE -- FIXED -- ROUGHLY ONE THIRD TO HALF A CUSTOMERS WERE SERVED BY A MUNICIPAL ENERGY AGGREGATORS. BUT THEY FOUND IT WAS HARD TO ACTUALLY BEAT THE PRICE OF THE INCUMBENT. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SO PEOPLE ARE NOW STARTING TO FOLD UP THOSE MUNICIPAL ENERGY AGGREGATORS AND GO BACK TO THE TO THE TO THE DOMINANT UTILITIES. THAT STATE ALSO HAS A SEPARATE CENTRAL PROCUREMENT AGENCY THE ILLINOIS' POWER AGENCY WHICH COURTNEY'S PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT FOR THE STATE'S ELECTRICITY MARKET. SO OF THOSE CENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT -- PLANNING PROVIDES CUSTOMERS ASSURANCE FOR RELIABILITY EVEN WITH RETAIL CHOICE. BUT IT ALSO SETS THE PRICE. AND THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY HAS TO BE. THEY'RE NOT FOCUSED ON DE CARBONIZATION. TEXAS TEXAS IS THE PLACE WHERE THEY JUST RIP THE BANDAID OFF COMPETITION RETAIL COMPETITION IS THE KEY TO MARKET -- STRUCTURE. THEIR RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDERS. AND THEY ALSO HAVE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS IS JUST STARTING UP THERE. IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDERS YOU'RE NOT IN ONE OF THE THE NEWLY FORMING CCA'S. THEM AND THE STATE. PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF TEXAS ASSIGN YOU. TO A RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDER -- THERE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY. DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH GENERATORS ARE PARTICIPATING WHOLE SO MARKETS THEY HAVE WHOLE GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS IN THE END THEY NEGOTIATE A A RATE. WITH THE RETAIL PROVIDERS THAT'S HOW THEY'RE CCA'S WORKED THE RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDERS ON THE HAND. ARE JUST STRAIGHT OUT COMPETITIVE BASED ONLY ON PRICE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY. ANY ANY REAL GOALS TOWARDS RENEWABLES TO SPEAK OF THEY'RE VERY CHEAP RATES. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PUBLIC GOODS CHARGE LIKE OUR LIKE -- CONSUMER ACCESS -- TO TO CHEAP ELECTRICITY OR AT THE ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. OR A MEDICAL BASS LINE. THERE YOU'RE JUST DEPENDENT ON THE MARKET. THEY DON'T HAVE A ENERGY EFFICIENCY -- SUBSIDIZED OR AIDED BY THE UTILITIES -- SO THEY HAVE HIGH USAGE WHAT WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY HIT THE SPOT MARKETS WIN. THE RETAIL PROVIDERS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY CURRENTLY UNDER CONTRACT. IS THOSE PRICES GO SKY HIGH. SO AS A RESULT. MOST CUSTOMERS ARE KIND OF BONTA UNBUNDLED AND DISAGGREGATED AMONGST ALL THESE OLD ENERGY PROVIDERS BUT THEY GET THEIR THEIR WIRES AND POLES SERVICES FROM FROM THESE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES. SO IF A COMPANY OF ONE OF THOSE RETAIL PROVIDERS FAILS SOMETIMES HAPPEN THE IS GET REASSIGNED TO ANOTHER -- RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDER -- THIS IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO GREAT BRITAIN WHERE CUSTOMERS REALLY DID NOT GO OUT AND LOOK VERY MUCH. AT WHAT THE DIFFERENT PRICES FOR SO BECAUSE OF THIS BOTH NEW YORK. WHICH HAD THE SAME PROBLEM IN TEXAS ARE CREATING WEBSITES TO COMPARE PRICES TO MAKE IT EASIER. FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AROUND SEE WHO CAN GIVEN THE CHEAPEST PRICES. AGAIN RELIABILITY IS MAINTAINED BY WHEN THE PRICES GO HIGH AND AND LET THE MARKET DECIDE -- GREAT BRITAIN IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLICATED -- CUSTOMERS CAN CHOOSE THEIR ELECTORATE SO I COULD SERVICE PROVIDER BUT PROBABLY 80% OF ALL CUSTOMERS IN ENGLAND GO WITH THE TOP SIX PROVIDERS WHO ARE THE OLD DOMINANT ELECTRICITY COMPANIES. OUR CUSTOMERS. TO USE. PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES -- DAME THE STATE WOULD LAST I HEARD THEY ARE STARTING TO SEE COMMUNITY AGGREGATOR STARTING TO FORM A LITTLE BIT MORE FOCUSED ON DE CARBONIZATION. THERE'S NO PREDETERMINED PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT QUIRK IN CASE OF FAILURE BECAUSE THERE'S SO THERE'S SEE AND AND IN THEIR MINDS A WIDE RANGE OF CHOICES. BUT IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A NEED TO AND THE THE NATIONAL REGULATOR STEPS IN OFF JIM WHICH IS -- WHICH IS GOT A COMPLICATED NAME ANYMORE REPEAT -- AN ACE DAY THEY BECOME THE SUPPLIER FLAT PASSED RESORT. SO -- AGAIN CUSTOMERS DID NOT EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO CHOOSE BASED ON PRICE OR ANY OTHER PATTERN THAT WE COULD SEE IT'S JUST THAT PEOPLE TENDED TO STAY WITH WHAT THEY HAVE. OUR CHALLENGES ARE REALLY DIFFERENT -- WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON GREEN POWER NOT JUST RE NOBLES BUT ALSO GHG REDUCTION RELIABILITY AND COST. WHEREAS MOST OF THE STATE'S F ONLY FOCUS TO ON TO THOSE AXES. BUT WE DID SEE SOME COMMON THEMES. CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT AND PRICE TRANSPARENCY ARE REALLY CRITICAL -- REGIONALIZED GRID. BEING ABLE TO PROCURE OUTSIDE OF THE NARROWLY POLITICALLY JURISDICTION ONLY DEFINED MARKET CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT. CENTRALIZED STATE PROCUREMENT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT TO REACHING GOALS AND TO ACTUALLY ENSURING RELIABILITY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CHOICES SOMETIMES DON'T GO TOGETHER WELL TO MAKE UP THE WHOLE. A SUCCESSFUL OUR ENERGY MARKETS HAVE A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT IN CASE THERE'S A FAILURE. SO CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE THIS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE HAVE PLAYED THEIR ROLE BY DEFAULT. INCLUDING BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SERVE UNDER THE LAW. AND SERVE A CUSTOMER SHOWS UP THEY HAVE TO SERVE THEM. BUT WE SAW DURING THE LAST ENERGY CRISIS WHEN THERE IS A FAILURE OF A ELECTRICITY SERVICE SERVICE PROVIDER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS GOT DUMPED ON TO ONE UTILITY. THE CUT THE THE PUBLIC TRICITY SERVICE PROVIDER FAILED BECAUSE THEY WERE BUYING THEIR ELECTRICITY AND THE WHOLESALE MARKET THERE WAS. HARD TO WEEKS HOT WEATHER EVERYBODY IN THE WEST WAS USING ALL THE GENERATION THEY GET ACCESS TO THIS COMPANY WAS LATE TO THE GAME. WAS PAYING VERY HIGH PRICES RAN OUT OF CASH. COULDN'T PAY FOR MORE ELECTRICITY. THEIR CUSTOMERS THAN GOT DUMPED ONTO THE PREVIOUS -- UTILITY AND THEY STARTED TO HEMORRHAGE CASH. AND SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD PATTERN YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME PLAN YOU WENT AHEAD CHEN INSURANCE PLAN THAT'S THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. SO WHAT WERE ALSO SEEN AS WE THE STRONG POSSIBILITY WE COULD FALL BEHIND IN OUR IN REACHING OUR GREEN GOALS THE SO THE STATE'S RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD REQUIRES THAT ALL I WHO USE. A COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS AND ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS MEET CERTAIN TARGETS. SB THREE FIFTY REQUIRES THAT ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES WHICH INCLUDES ALL THOSE HAVE ONLY SIXTY FIVE OF THEIR PERCENT OF THEIR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD ELIGIBLE KERMIT FROM CONTRACTS. THAT ARE TEN YEARS OR LONGER BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE SHARP REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ON THE RENEWABLE FOR FOR THE STANDARD SAID. DE IDENTIFIED SOME CLEAR CHALLENGES ADDITIVE COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS THE CCAC AND ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND IN MEETING THEIR OUR PS REQUIREMENTS. SO CAL CCA INDICATES THAT THAT TWO GIGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE PROJECTS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT. OR ARE THE BILL TO SERVE FONG. THEIR CUSTOMERS OF THE CCA'S BY. TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S TWO GIGAWATTS THAT'S ABOUT THE FIFTY SIX PROJECTS ROMA TOTALING -- TWENTY ONE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. NOT ALL OF PROJECT YOUR BILL IN MY EXPERIENCE OF HAVING BUILT A LOT OF LARGE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS IS THAT NOT ALL PROJECTS THE CARD GET CONTRACTS YOU THINK YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL SUCCESS PATTERN FOR PROJECTS BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEES IN IN THE MARKET. EVEN IF THE THOSE PROJECTS ARE ALL BUILT THE CCASTILL HAVE A SHORTFALL FOR MEETING THEIR REAP ARE THERE AND THEY'RE IN A GREAT RESOURCE PORTFOLIO GOALS. FOR ENERGY. PROBABLY THEY'LL HAVE TO TRIPLE THEIR CURRENT PROCUREMENT PLANS BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND IT SIX TIMES AS MUCH BY. TWENTY THIRTY THE MEETING IN SIZE OF THE EXISTING PROJECTS THAT THE LIST. IS ABOUT ONE POINT SIDE GET FIVE GIGAWATTS TO MEET THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL THAT'S ROUGHLY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PROJECTS SO. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC I'M NOT JUST I'M USING THAT BECAUSE WE HAD BETTER INFORMATION BUT THE ELECTRICITY SERVE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS ALSO PROBABLY ARE GOING TO HAVE SIMILAR KINDS OF PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES THOUGH FOR THE FOR THE COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS IS THAT HAVE A HARD TIME. GETTING FINANCING BECAUSE ALL THEY HAVE THIS CUSTOMERS THEY DON'T HAVE ASSETS THEY DON'T HAVE PROPERTY THAT THE PEOPLE CAN LEAN ON IN CASE THERE'S A FAILURE TO PAY. SO FOR A SIMPLE SOLUTION WOULD BE FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT CREATE THE CCA'S TO PUT THEIR BALANCE SHEETS ON THE LINE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY CREATES UNCERTAINTY AND FINANCING. HOWEVER MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ARE A LITTLE LEERY OF GETTING INTO THE VOLATILE AND SOMETIMES HARSH ELECTRIC MARKETS. SO WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME SHIPS WITH THE RELIABILITY IN THE FOR MORE WILL BE CALL RESOURCE ADEQUACY OF WAIVERS AFTER THE THE FAILURE REQUIRED ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TO PROCURE ALL THE ELECTRICITY THEY WOULD NEED FOR STE FORESEEABLE PEAK CIRCUMSTANCES. AND TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT TO US THE THE LARGER PICTURE IS THE IT UNTIL LAST YEAR WE MAYBE HAD TWO REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS FROM COMPLIANCE. OVER THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. THE YEAR BEFORE LAST WE HAVE ELEVEN FROM ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AND CCA'S SOME OF THE CCA'S ARE SERVED BY THIS ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR SHORT TERM CONTRACTS AND WITH THOSE WAIVERS FOR COMPLIANCE HAVE ANY ANYTHING TO DO WITH. PRESERVING RACHEL WAS A MAJOR ISSUE THE MAJOR ISSUE IS THAT MANY OF THESE SMALLER ENTITIES ARE FOCUSED IN PARTICULAR AREAS WHERE THE GRID TOPOLOGY DOESN'T ALLOW ALL THE ELECTRICITY THAT THEY NEED TO FLOW IN FROM OUTSIDE ON THOSE PEAK DAYS SO YOU HAVE TO HAVESOME GENERATION WITHIN THOSE LOAD POCKETS. GIVEN THAT WITHIN THOSE LOAD PARKS YOU MAY HAVE TO SEE CA SOME MEDIA X. ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS AND SOME I OWE YOU CUSTOMERS. THERE'S COMPETITION TO GET ACCESS TO THAT BACK UP GENERATION WHICH IS DWINDLING BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY GETTING CONTRACTS OR MAYBE TWO HUNDRED HOURS A YEAR. AND IT GETS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TO FIT WITHIN THE HARSH AND SOMETIMES VOLATILE SITUATIONS. OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET PARTICULARLY IN THOSE CONSTRAINTS SPACES. BUT IT REPRESENTS IN MY MIND AT LEAST A RISK TO THE THE THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SET TO GUARANTEE RELIABILITY. AND WE NEED TO SECURE THAT WE'VE LOOKED IN OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCEEDING TO MAYBE CREATE WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS IS SAID NO MORE ONE YEAR CONTRACT BRING US THREE YEAR CONTRACT. SO THAT MAY ACTUALLY ENTICE SOME PROVIDERS INTO SIGNING WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER ENTITIES. BECAUSE THERE'S A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEIR FOR THEIR THEIR GENERATION. WITHIN THOSE LOADS CONSTRAINED AREAS. BUT WE ALSO WORRY THAT MAYBE WHAT WE NEED IS SOME KIND OF CENTRAL PROCUREMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT CAN CURE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS AND NOT LEAVE SOME CUSTOMER AT RISK OF RELIABILITY THAT THAT'S THAT'S OUR FEAR. SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT WHAT THAT WITHIN THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCEEDING [inaudible] SO. AGAIN YOU KNOW WE ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN. THESE MORE. CLEAR MODELS WHERE ALL CUSTOMERS HAVE RETAIL PROVIDERS FOR ELECTRICITY THEN THERE'S TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION. ON THE SIDE SOMETIMES THOSE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATORS CAN COMPETE. WITHIN THESE OTHER MARKETS TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY OR TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY ON A CHOICE BASIS CUSTOMERS CAN PICK AND CHOOSE. WE'RE NOT AT THE FAR END THAT WE STARTED OUT HOWEVER EITHER WHICH IS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITY WHERE THE UTILITIES ON THE ELECTRICITY THEY OWN THE WIRES THEY OWN EVERYTHING ELSE. AND DO YOU ALL DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE AT ALL. WE'RE IN BETWEEN. AND THAT THAT PROBABLY REQUIRES SOME PROTECTIONS AND SO. WE TRIED TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE GAPS IN OUR SECOND REPORT FROM OUR CHOICE PROJECT IT'S HERE BEFORE BE FOR YOU TODAY WE RELEASED IT AND OCTOBER. ALREADY WE'RE SEEING SOME. BILLS THAT MATCH SOME OF THE THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE SEE THAT WE IDENTIFIED HERE. SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE THE THE YOU DO UTILITY DIVERSITY CONTRACTING IS MORE MORE CUSTOMERS DEPART FROM THE ELECTRICITY COMPANY UTILITIES FROM FOR THEIR THEIR OUR ELECTRICITY.% THE MONEY THAT SPENT ELSEWHERE DOESN'T GO INTO THAT DIVERSITY CONTRACTING PROCESS WHICH IS NOW A TEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A HUGE INVESTMENT IN TO FRAGILE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE NOT JUST FOR JOBS. BUT ALSO TO BUILD THE BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE HELPS TO MAKE THOSE THRIVING COMMUNITIES AMERICA MANY LEVELS. SENATOR BRADFORD IS ACTUALLY -- PUT FORWARD SOME LANGUAGE ON THAT. ONE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE -- STE RESORT BILL FROM SENATOR HERTZBERG THE AND I'M. I WILL LEAVE IT TO HIM TO CONTINUE TO CLARIFY HIS THINKING ON THAT HIS STAFF HAS BEEN MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ACTUALLY CREATE THAT INSURANCE HEDGE. AGAINST FAILURES OF ANY THESE DIVERSE COMPANIES. HE ALSO HAS PROPOSED EARLIER EXPANDING THE DIRECT ACCESS FOR ALL COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS HIS INITIAL BILL ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE LIFTED THE CAP LAST YEAR. WE WORKED WITH THEM AND HE WE HAVE A MORE FACED PROCESS THAT WERE WORKING UNDER TO ACTUALLY EXPAND IT TO A LARGER NUMBER THIS YEAR. BUT HE WANTS A PLAN TO EXPAND DIRECT ACCESS COMPLETELY BY TWENTY TWENTY SO WE WILL PROVIDE THAT TO HIM -- I THINK THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT OR CONTENT TO CONFIRM THAT ARE CONTAINED HERE I DO WE'RE STILL TRYING TO REMAIN SOMEWHAT AGNOSTIC. PUT TO ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS HEART OVER PAYING ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS WHO DEPARTED. SO YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ON FARE SUBSIDY. THAT WE TRY TO KEEP ELECTRICITY RATES AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYBODY THAT WE KEEP IT RELIABLE AND THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CONTINUE TO MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AT THE SAME TIME. THAT WE FOLLOW OUT THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION FOR MANY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES MANY DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS. BUT I WILL I WILL JUST SAY THAT GENERALLY THE PLACES THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT THAT HAVE BEEN MOST SUCCESSFUL HAVE A CLEAR MODEL AND THEY TEND TO DOCTOR LEAN TOWARDS. A COMPLETE FREEDOM OF CHOICE AS OPPOSED TO THE KINDS OF MIX THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS EDU HAVING THAT. SORRY THAT'S A LOT TO COVER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AGAIN -- THIS WEEK -- FREE SHEET IF IF I'M AGAIN I'M HAVE TO BUY NEW BUSINESSES PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME. WE'VE I WILL THAT'S FOR SURE. YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND PAPER AND YOU MENTIONED IT TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CCA'S AND IT HIGHLIGHTED AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE'S THERE'S NO RATE APPROVAL PROCESS WITHIN OVER APPROVAL AUTHORITY WITHIN THE CPC -- WELL THERE IS FOR I USE -- DO YOU YOU KNOW GIVEN THE SHE SHOULD COME UNDER THE OF REGULATORY AUTHORITY THE CPUC. WELL SO THERE'S A WIDESPREAD BELIEF AMONG CCA ARM OPERATORS THAT THEY HOME WILL ALWAYS BE CHEAPER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY PROPERTY TAX AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY SHAREHOLDERS. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE SIMPLY BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS TO IS PRIMARILY PROVIDING. ELECTRICITY SERVICE THOSE OTHER COSTS STILL GO TO RATE PAYERS BY THE BILL IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR ELECTRIC BILL. USUALLY IT'S STILL UNDER THE NAME OF YOUR UTILITY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE BILLING SERVICE TO ALL THE CCA'S. THERE'S AN ELECTRICITY CHARGE IN SOMETIMES IT WILL NAME THE CCA IF THEY CARE TO BE NAMED AND THEN THE REST OF THE BILL IS TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION NON BY PASSABLE CHARGES AND THE PUBLIC GOODS CHARGES. SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE'S ENOUGH LEFT. ON THOSE THIN MARGINS OF RESELLING ELECTRICITY. FROM THIRD PARTY CONTRACT THAT THERE'S WHO CAN REALLY BE THAT KIND OF COMPETITION THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT. MY FEARS I ACTUALLY HAVE MORE TO DO WITH HOW DO YOU MAKE. WHAT'S LEFT OF THOSE OLD UTILITIES WHO STILL HAVE TO RUN THE POLES AND WIRES STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES UNDER THE PUBLIC GOODS CHARGE STILL HAVE TO FIND THE SMALL GENERATOR INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR BATTERY STORAGE. STILL HAVE TO TO FUND ON ENERGY METERING HOW WILL THEY ACTUALLY BE STABLE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THOSE KEY SERVICES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAS TASKED THEM WITH. AND THE ANSWER THERE AND THERE'S A VERY GOOD PAPER FROM FROM MACKENZIE IS TO MOVE TOWARDS A MORE FLAT CHARGE BECAUSE MOST OF WHAT TEY'RE DOING IS NOT VOLUMETRIC. PEOPLE DON'T USE MORE OR LESS OF THEY MAY ACTUALLY USE MORE ELECTRICITY DURING PEAK CONGESTION HOURS. SO THE THERE BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURES THAT CAN MEET THAT. THE OTHER THING THAT I FEAR FOR SOME OF THE THE LAST -- WELL GROUNDED CCA LEADERSHIP IS THAT THEY WON'T. USE THE STATE'S. EMERGING TIME OF USE PROGRAM WHICH SINCE PRICE SIGNALS FOR PEOPLE TO AVOID USING DURING THOSE PEAK HOURS AND SO THE BEST EXAMPLE WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT. WHERE THEY GOT 8% REDUCTION ON A MINIMUM OF THEIR ELECTRICITY USE THROUGH A PEAK CHARGE DURING THE TWO HUNDRED HOURS OF THE YEAR? WHEN ACTUALLY TRICITY IS IN SHORT SUPPLY SAU KHI THEY TELL PEOPLE CHARGING MORE? SO THAT WE CAN BUILD THOSE POWER PLANTS JUST TO PROVIDE YOU POWER DURING THOSE TWO HUNDRED HOURS OR YOU CAN GET SMART USE TECHNOLOGY WILL HELP YOU WITH ENERGY TOOLS. TO AVOID USING ELECTRICITY HOURS THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS. BUT WHAT I DO THINK IS IMPORTANT ON EVERY LEVEL WHETHER IT'S ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS WHETHER IT'S IT'S CCA'S WEATHER'S INCOME. IS WE NEED BETTER TOOLS THAT SHOW PEOPLE THE RATES THEY CAN CHOOSE FROM. BECAUSE AS IT IS THEY JUST HAVE TO FORMATION VIED PEOPLE AS THEY DO IN TEXAS AND NEW YORK SO PEOPLE CAN SEE AND COMPARE. IN IN THIS FOLLOW UP ON ON THE REGULATORY ASPECT OF IT DO YOU THINK YOU COULD DO. I DON'T HAVE BETTER NECESSARY JOB IF YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. TO THOROUGHLY FOR DISCLOSURE I THINK THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SOMEBODY HAS TO DO THAT IT COULD BE YES IT COULD BE THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. BUT EVERYBODY HAS TO PUT THEIR CARDS ON THE TABLE. AND I'M IN DIFFERENT AS TO WHO THAT REALLY DOES THAT PROVIDES IT BUT IT'S GOT TO BE THERE. I DO WORRY MORE ON THIS ISSUE OF MEETING OUR OUR OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND HOW WE ACTUALLY DO THAT. WE KNOW THAT EVEN IF EVERYBODY NEEDS THEIR ASPIRATIONAL ON RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD GOALS. THAT THAT ADDS UP TO LESS THAN ON THE CLEAN AND RELIABLE GRID THERE WE WANT SIMPLY BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CHOICES DON'T ALWAYS MATCH UP. AND TOO MANY PEOPLE MAKING DIFFERENT CHOICES SOMETIMES WILL FORCE. MORE NEED -- FOR FOR A NATURAL GAS SPEAKERS TO BACK IT UP HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY HARMONIZE THAT AND YET THE OPTIMAL. OUT OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT CHOICES AND THAT MAKE REQUIRE A CENTRAL PROCUREMENT -- MECHANISM SIMILAR TO NEW YORK TO INITIALLY -- MUCH THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO ALSO THANK OF PRESIDENT PICKER FOR YOUR PRESENTATION BUT AS I LISTEN TO A TODAY AND HAS LAST WEEK AND FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AS WE TALKED ABOUT I'M ALWAYS LIFE WHAT CONCERNS. AND I THINK YOUR OVERALL PRESENTATION IS ONE OF CONCERN AS WELL AS TO THE FUTURE WHERE WE ARE IN CALIFORNIA AS IT RELATES TO ENERGY [inaudible] WOULD YOU. DETERMINAR -- CLASSIFY OR DESCRIBE OUR OURPS PROGRAM IS BEING SUCCESSFUL. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS THAT FOR WHAT I BELIEVE THE REAL PURPOSE WAS WHICH WAS TO STIMULATE INVESTMENT IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND DEVELOPERS THERE WEREN'T PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY MARKET PLACE YES. WE NOW HAVE FROM THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES PROVIDING PROBABLY CLOSE TO FORTY THIRD BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND 40% OF ALL THEIR ELECTRICITY FROM REAL PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE GROUND. WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE CONTRACTS FOR PROJECTS BUILT BY DEVELOPERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED BUILDING IN CALIFORNIA HAVE MOST OF THEIR ENTITLEMENTS IN PLACE AND ARE JUST WAITING FOR DEMAND TO REACH THE POINT THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN START TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION AND CONNECT TO THE GRID. THOSE UTILITIES WILL PROBABLY BE SOMEPLACE UPWARDS OF 4250% -- SOMETIME TALK AROUND TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND CAN EASILY GET BRING NOBLES HAVE BECOME EASY. THE CHALLENGES RELIABILITY AND D. CARBONIZATION AND SO THOSE I THINK ARE ARE -- AND COST WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A HEAVY PRICE PAID TO GET THERE. THE EARLY CONTRACTS WERE VERY EXPENSIVE. IN PART BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH FOLKS WHO HAD NOT REALLY HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE BUILDING THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. THEY YOU HAD BANKS THERE WERE CLEARLY NERVOUS ABOUT LENDING INTO CALIFORNIA ONE HAND TO THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT -- PRESIDENT. OBAMA'S. STIMULUS DOLLARS STARTED TO RELENT BUT THAT WAS AIDED BY THE FACT THAT THEY STARTED TO SEE SUCCESS. THAT IN I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT A LOT OF OF INNOVATION AND BRINGING LABOR COSTS DOWN ON THE PART OF OF THOSE DEVELOPERS PRIMARILY BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT IT TOOK TO CONSTRUCT A WIND OR SOLAR PROJECT. HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE PRICE DOWN THESE DAYS [inaudible] SO FROM. THE THE AT THE AT THAT POINT I THINK WITH SUCCESS BUT IT WAS IT WASN'T REALLY AIMED AT PRICE OR RELIABILITY THAT WAS HERS BEING DEALT WITH SEPARATELY. IT WAS FOCUSED ON JUST BRINGING THESE NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO COMMON USE AND AN UNDERSTANDING THAT AND I'M. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GRAPPLE WITH OKAY YOU'VE SEEN UTILITIES MAKE A MAJOR. YOU DON'T TRANSITION TOWARDS RENEWABLE ENERGY ENTERING THE LEAGUE'S LONG TERM LONG TERM CONTRACT AND NOW. IN THE SAME TIME THE CUSTOMERS ARE BEING ALLOWED TO MIGRATE AWAY WHAT SENSE DOES THAT MAKE THAT WE HAVE ASKED HIM TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT. AND NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE UP 260% IN SOME ASPECTS FOR THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMERS A SERVER. AND THERE'S NO GREATER AMOUNT OF RE NOBLES AVAILABLE TO SEE C. H. R. E. S. BEES AND THEY ARE TO THE UTILITIES THEY'RE ALL STICKING THEIR STRONG TO THE SAME POLL. A RENEWABLE ENERGY SO ARE WE ACHIEVING OUR GOAL OF MORE CLEANER ENERGY WHEN IT'S ONLY SO SO MUCH AVAILABLE IN UTILITIES ARE PICKED ARE PACKED WITH YOUR ARE PROCURING AND CONTINUE TO PROCURE. POWER I NEVER SEEK TO QUESTION THE IT WILL HAPPEN AND AND THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I AND I AND I SPEAK FROM A INDIVIDUAL WHO. WORK FOR UTILITY FOR NUMBER YEARS AND I'M NOT HERE CARRYING A WATER BECAUSE I KNOW WITH THE DO WELL AND WHAT THEY DO LOUSY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M ALL FOR CUSTOMER CHOICE BUT THE SCENARIO YOU GAVE IS NOT CUSTOMER CHOICES CUSTOMER FORCE. I MEAN AND YOU SAID ILLINOIS' MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS ARE GOING BACK TO THE INCUMBENT UTILITY WHAT WHAT'S THE REASON FOR IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE CUSTOMERS IT'S ACTUALLY AN ASSOCIATION OF THE THOSE -- MUNICIPAL ENERGY AGGREGATORS GOT TOGETHER BECAUSE THEIR HOPE WAS THEY WERE GOING TO BEAT THE PRICE OF OF THE THE UTILITIES AND THEY COULDN'T I THINK THEY DECIDE WOMAN THIS IS NOT WHATWE SHOULD BE DOING ON BEHALF OF OUR COMMUNITIES. OKAY SO MY LASTING SINCE THEY HAVE NO BALANCE SHEET -- THEY HAVE NO ASSETS. I MEAN AGAIN. I'VE SEEN THE SCENARIO THIRTY YEARS AGO MANY CITIES AND AND CALIFORNIA FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY ALL THOUGHT THEY CAN GET INTO THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS AND HELP PEOPLE BUY HOMES. TODAY YOU'RE PROBABLY BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND ANY CITY WERE FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS PROGRAM HOUSE THIS ANY DIFFERENT BECAUSE AGAIN. MOST CITIES HAVE ENOUGH DOT A HARD ENOUGH TIME RUNNING THEIR PARKS AND REC DEPARTMENT LET ALONE ELECTRICAL GRID ITSELF. AND YOU SAID THAT THEY WILL BE THE DEFAULT OF FALTER. WHAT WOULD I SHOULD SAY TO POP BACK TO THE CITY IF YOUR CCA FAILS WHAT CITY ONCE ON THE BALLOT YOU? WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN ARE YOU DON'T PAY THEIR PENSION OBLIGATION? FOR SO ELECTRICITY MARKETS A SAID CAN BE VERY VOLATILE VERY HARSH AND I THINK THAT -- THAT COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR CITY -- MANAGERS ARE VERY WARY OF PUTTING HEIR CREDIT -- ON THE LINE IN THESE RYAN KINDS OF OF ENERGY MARKETS. SO THAT LEAVES THE THE THE THE LARGEST CREDIT ASSET. FOR THESE CLEAN COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS THE ELECTRICITY SEPARATE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. HAVE A DIFFERENT ADVANTAGE THEY'RE USUALLY OUT OF STATE UTILITIES. WHO ARE DABBLING INCH RETAIL CHOICE HEARING CALIFORNIA? THEY HAVE BALLOT SHEETS THEY HAVE THE HOME FOR THE HOME UTILITY AND ITS ASSETS TO THE BACK OF I HEARD I HEARD A QUESTION IN THERE THAT WASN'T. CLEAR TO ME IN YOUR ANSWER AND AND MY MY QUESTION ONLY REQUIRES A VERY SIMPLE YES OR NO. BUT IT'S A KIND OF PIGGY BACKING ON SOME OF THE DISCUSSION HERE BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT. I HAVEN'T ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT. AND I'M JUST GOING TO BE HARD TO GET. TO BUT YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT WE NEED SOME. SOMEONE IN THE STATE TO IN A PROCUREMENT BALANCING AT SOME LEVEL. AND THAT IS OCCASION BYE BYE. THE WSDOM OF THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF HOW WE HAVE. CHOSEN -- TO YOU KNOW ALLOW FOR THE EMERGENCE OF OF CCA'S IN THIS IN THIS CASE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CCA SHOULD BE UNDER YOUR REGULATORY CONTROL. I'M I I THINK THE DATE TO SOME EXTENT THEY ARE BECAUSE WE SAT THE STATE'S GOALS FOR ENERGY AND WE'RE WORKING OUT HOW THAT WORKS UNDER THE NEW INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN WHICH BALANCES BOTH. RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD BUT ALSO THE CARBON READ ACT -- THE J. SHE REDUCTION GOALS OF SB. THREE FIFTY SO WE SET THE GOALS THE QUESTION IS IS DOES IT IS THE CPUC THE RIGHT AGENCY TO ACTUALLY DO PROCUREMENT AS A BACKSTOP IN OTHER STATES IT'S A SEPARATE AGENCY FROM THE REGULATOR SO ALL I'LL SAY THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR THAT BACKSTOPS PROTECTION. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT HAS TO THAT'S IT JOBS HI SO. HI SO PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY DOING THAT AT THE RETAIL LEVEL -- DAY SET TRANSMISSION STANDARD SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT FOR THEM ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT THEY ACTUALLY -- GET STUCK DOING THAT FOR AND NERSC RULES OR THROUGH THERE ARE THE RUN MUST RUN -- CONTRACTS BUT AGAIN YOU COULD CHOOSE ANY OF THOSE I'M SURE YOU GET A SATISFACTORY ANSWER OTHER STATES HAVE CHOSEN A SEPARATE ENTITY. THAT FOCUSES ON THAT. PUTS SOME PUTS THE THE THE THE PROGRAMS TOGETHER AND THEN EVERYBODY HAS TO GO THERE FOR EITHER THEIR ALL THEIR ENERGY OR FOR SOME RESIDUAL THAT THEY CAN'T PROCURE. CENTER WIENER A LESSON FROM CENTER. IF I CAN BUILD ON THAT JUST EVER SO SLIGHTLY TALKING ABOUT THE RELIABILITY -- THE CHI SO ON THE RELIABILITY ISSUE THERE'S ALREADY SOME MECHANISMS IN PLACE IF ENOUGH RESOURCES ARE BOUGHT IN A LOCAL AREA FOR THE KAISER TO STEP IN AND BUY SOME RESOURCES. ON IT'S NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT MECHANISM THAT'S WHY THERE'S A LOT TO CONVERSATIONS ON DIFFERENT MECHANISM. A BROADER ISSUE WHERE THE ICE SO WE REALLY CAN'T STEP IN AND HELP THOUGH AND WE ARE SEEING THIS AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING. IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING LONG TERM. AND THE RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO BUY LONG TERM DON'T ADD UP TO OUR CLINICAL. THE I. SO WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY POTENTIALLY TO STEP IN AND SAY THESE RESOURCES DON'T RULE OUT -- ADD UP TO OUR RELIABILITY GOALS. IT'S NOT AT ALL CLEAR THAT UNDER BECAUSE IS FOR JURISDICTIONAL THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY YOU HAVE ENOUGH SOLAR YOU HAVE ENOUGH GEO THERMAL YOU HAVE ENOUGH -- PUMP HYDRO THOSE RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE. DOESN'T SEEM TO BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE WELL FIT TO THE HI SO AND WE'RE ALREADY SEEN THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE ISRAELI RESOURCE PLANNING. THAT WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES SAY THIS IS WHAT OUR LONG TERM PLANS ARE THEY ARE ADDING UP TO THE STATEWIDE GOALS AND THAT'S WHAT AT THE POINT WHERE WE WE ARE QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT YET. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A FEW PEOPLE ASKED WHETHER THE CPC CEBU CITY SHOULD HAVE A GREATER ROLE. IN REGULATING -- CCA'S AYE -- I WOULD AND FRANKLY WITH ALL RESPECT IS TO FIGURE YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY -- ARE -- FURTHER BOLSTER MY BELIEF -- I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE CPC HAVING A GREATER ROLE I THINK THE CPUC WOULD -- PRETTY QUICKLY MOVED TO KILL OFF CCA'S INTO SPRING SUPER BLUNT -- AND HI. I AM I HAVE A SENSE OF YOUR OF FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE AGENCY -- BECAUSE I I BELIEVE THAT THE AGENCY IS ATTEMPTING TO THE DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS PAPER CENTRALIZE MONOPOLY MODEL THAT HAS NOT WORKED WELL. FOR CALIFORNIA. THE HOSTILITY TOWARD CCA'S THE HOSTILITY TOWARDS -- D. -- WHICH WE'RE SEEING AGAIN AND AND AND SAYS THE REALLY PROBLEMATIC -- PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT -- DR LEGISLATION THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THAT LEGISLATION COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE AND TOTALLY OVERTURN THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE -- AND SPECIFICALLY -- YOU MU MENTIONED TODAY OF THE TERMS OF CCA'S POTENTIALLY NOT -- MEETING THERE -- RESOURCE ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS NOT SEE THIS VIDEO BUT I'VE BEEN INFORMED THAT AN ASSEMBLY HEARING. EARLIER THIS YEAR HE MADE A STATEMENT THERE WERE ELEVEN RESOURCE ADEQUACY RAPE WAIVERS GRANTED AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THAT A MAJORITY WERE GRANTED TO CCA'S -- THE CCA'S WENT INTO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST OF THE CPUC. AND IT APPEARS THAT OF THE ELEVEN WEEK. OR A. WAIVERS GRANTED LAST YEAR. ZERO WERE FOR CCA'S SO COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY FOR ME HOW MANY. OF THE ELEVEN ARE A WAIVER IS GRANTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WORK FOR CCA'S. SO USUALLY I SAY CCA OR ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDER SUN I DIDN'T SAY THAT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M MY APOLOGIES IS HOW HOW OTHERS. OF ELEVEN RESOURCE ADEQUACY WAIVERS GRANTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN HOW MANY WERE FOR CCA'S. I'M I BELIEVE OUT OF THE NUMBER ELEVEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EITHER ONE OR ZERO WERE FOR CCA THE REST WERE FOR E. S. PEAS -- BUT LET'S HAVE. THE TALKING ABOUT THE ARE A WAIVERS ON FLOATING AROUND CONFUSES THE ISSUES I THINK BOTH WAYS TO BE QUITE HONEST. I AM SO IS PRESENT PICKER WAS ALLUDING TO A LITTLE WHILE AGO ON I THINK IT WAS CENTER HERE HUESO ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. YOU ARE A WAIVERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE FOR LOCAL RESOURCE -- AND THERE'S A MECHANISM IN THERE IF A LOAD SERVING ENTITY INCLUDING THE S. P. S. CCA OR AND I OWE YOU CAN'T. GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED LOCALLY -- THEY CAN ASK FOR WAY FOR THE WAIVER PROCESS EXISTS TO MITIGATE AGAINST MARKET POWER SO IF THEY'RE GOING OUT AND TRYING TO BUY. A RESOURCE IN THE GENERATORS WITHHOLDING -- THE INTO T. IS NOT. WE'VE GRANTED THE LAST YEAR I THINK TEN OF THE ELEVEN WAIVERS -- IN ONE WE THOUGHT DIDN'T OPERATE PROPERLY THERE -- WE'RE SEEING A SIMILAR TREND -- THIS YEAR -- THIS HAS TO DO THE GROWTH IN THE WAIVERS WE DON'T THINK HAS TO DO BECAUSE THE C. C. A. R. E. S. P. YEAR THE I. ARE YOU IS A BAD ACTOR. WE THINK IT'S COMING BECAUSE OF A CONFLUENCE OF TWO SIX ONE THERE'S ACTUALLY LESS LOCAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE NOW THAN THERE WERE. FIVE YEARS AGO BECAUSE THE ONCE THROUGH COOLEY POWER PLANTS ARE CLOSING DOWN AND THAT IS THEN MAKING FOR A TIGHTER MARKET ON LOCAL RELIABILITY -- I'VE IT'S ARGUABLE WHETHER THAT'S A GOOD THING OR NOT WE'RE GETTING TO THAT JUST ENOUGH RESOURCES AND NOT OVER PROCURING IF YOU'RE MEMBER COUPLE YEARS AGO THE LA TIMES IS PRETTY CRITICAL OF WE HAD TOO MUCH RESOURCE. NOW WERE THERE ON AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE IS IF YOU HAVE MRE AND MORE ENTITIES TRYING TO FIVE FROM THE SAME SET OF PLANTS. THOSE PLANS HAVE AN ABILITY NOW TO POTENTIALLY. PLAY THE MARKET A LITTLE BIT SO WE THINK THAT COMBINATION OF HAVING A LOT OF ENTITIES TRYING TO PROCURE THE THIS IS DOING THE PROBLEM. THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ASKING FOR THE WAIVER IS A BAD ACTOR. IT'S THE FACT THAT WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF WAIVERS IS THE SIGN THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE MARKET. RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND BUT THE THE COMMENTS WERE HEARING ARE THIS CONSISTENT DRUM BEAT -- THERE'S A RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROBLEM WITH THIS YOU SEE AIDS IS A RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROBLEM WITH THE CCA'S. AND I I JUST THINK. YOU KNOW. I THINK THE FACTS DON'T SUPPORT THAT -- AND AND THIS IS WHY I WOULD NOT SUPPORT EXPANDING CP'S THIRTY OVER OF THAT I AGAIN I WILL I'LL APOLOGIZE FOR THE WAY THAT I CHARACTERIZE THE PROBLEM BUT I WILL NOT SAY THAT THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM [inaudible] SO RUBIO [inaudible] THANK YOU. ONE IDEA SURE MISTER BRAD FIRST FRUSTRATION I DO AGREE WITH YOU -- AND SOME PEOPLE HERE JUST ANSWERED SOME OF MY QUESTIONS BUT I HAVE A OF A CURIOSITY DISCUSSED VIA. PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITETHINGS TO TEXAS AND I BELIEVE IN YOUR CAR YOU WENT THAT ROUTE CAN INJURE AND IN ENGLAND. YOU SURE YOU'RE INSIDE ASKED TO WHAT WERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY WERE FACING AS THEY WERE MOVING TOWARDS THIS OUT PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITE THERE ARE MANY OUR PARTY IS TO WHO ARE. NOMINALLY UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE CPUC WHO DON'T HAVE TO REPORT TO US WHAT THEIR PRICES ARE. AND SO THAT'S WHY I SAY THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE WEBSITE I'M IN DIFFERENT AS TO WHETHER IT'S US OR ANOTHER AGENCY. BUT I THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY ACTUALLY SEE THE PRICES. PROBABLY ALSO THE AS THE CDC IS DOING ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO COMPARE. THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF DE CARBONITE SINGING GREENING IS WELL IT'S BEYOND JUST OUR PS BECAUSE YOU GET A ONE YEAR CONTRACT FOR OUR PS SCHOOL AND TO BE ABLE TO PORTRAY THAT. BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME WAY FOR PEOPLE TO REALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON UNDERNEATH. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU. SENATOR HERTZBERG [inaudible] ON I APOLOGIZE TO MR MEMBERS I WAS THERE EARLIER FOR THE PRESENTATION I JUST WANTED TO UP. NOT SO MUCH AS QUESTIONS WHICH IS JUST YOUR THOUGHTS WITH THE COMMITTEE AS WE ENGAGE IN THE SUBJECT MATTER HERE THE BROADER THINK. HERE IN IT'S KIND OF SOME CONCERNS THAT I HAVE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I HAVE TO MEASURES THIS AND I AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE CONCLUSIONS ON THEN WE STARTED TO CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS ONCE CENTER COMPARE PROCUREMENT ONE ON PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT. LAST YEAR WE HAD A RESOURCE ADEQUACY MEASURE WITH THOSE THREE PILLARS OF THE ARCHITECTURE REALLY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO INFORM AS WE GO FORWARD. AS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES MAY CHOOSE TO BE PPED WIRES AND POLES COMPANIES. YOU STILL HAVE TO CREATE A SOCIETY WE PREVENT AGAINST BROWNOUTS AND BLACKOUTS THERE'S STILL HAS TO BE IF THE PERFECT STORM HAPPENS. THERE HAS TO BE A BACK UP PLAN WE LOAD ON THROUGH THE P. C. AND FOR MANY MANY YEARS ALL SORTS OF SOCIALIZATION COSTS FOR SENIORS FOR ALL SORTS OF STUFF. AND WE HAVE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS NOT MAYBE ARTFULLY OR NOT ARTFULLY GRAPPLED WITH AS YOU CORRECTLY NOTE IN YOUR ANALYSIS YEAR YOUR YOUR SUMMARY HERE. COST ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES WE JUST HAD A TALKED ABOUT THE CCA'S MAY BE -- TAKING ON SOME OF THE LIABILITY FOR THE FIRES YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE ON THE ELECTRON SERVE YOUR ELECTRONS AND AND AND BE IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM I'M NOT SUGGESTING. THE DEAL BUT BUT AS WE SIT DOWN WITH THIS INTERESTING FOR INFLECTION POINT MEMBERS IT IS I SEE IT WHERE WE'VE DONE ALL THIS BIG PICTURE STUFF ON PERCENTAGES OF OUR P. S.'S AND BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WORLD TECHNOLOGICALLY BY VIRTUE WHAT TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE THE COST UPPER K. W. OUR ON ARIOUS ALTERNATIVES WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF NEW THINGS IN THE PIPELINE. BUT WE'RE REALLY AT THAT INFLECTION POINT WHERE AS WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT NEW WORLD ORDER IS. THAT'S WHY I HAVE THIS COST RICK THE THE THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT THATSENT TO PROCUREMENT NOT TO ADVOCATED BUT TO TRY TO AT LEAST TWO ARE COMMITTEE. MEMBERS MISTER CHAIRMAN TO BEGIN TO START THINKING ABOUT THAT THE MUCH MORE SERIOUS WAYS WERE KIND OF PASS THE OTHER ISSUES AND INTO THE REAL RESTRUCTURING OF WHAT THIS IS GONNA LOOK LIKE AND DO WE ALLOWED AT WAIVERS AND HOW THAT RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROCESS WORKS WE DID THAT IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE SO I JUST VERY SENSITIVE TO IT I THINK WE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE BEFORE US AND YOU KNOW WE CREATE CCA'S THAT I THINK WERE IN A ROOM STEPS. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A MARKET MECHANISM TO PROVIDE RENEWABLES AND THE LIKE TO IT BUT THERE'S SOME INTERESTING CHALLENGES THERE ARE CONTINUE TO SURVIVE BUT I THINK IS WHAT WE'RE ALL IN FOR A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A LIABILITY. FOR OF PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU YOU SOMEWHAT SOME RICE A PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING. AND I JUST WANNA. THAT BRING US BACK OF WE'VE GOT WE BASICALLY WENT THROUGH A ONE HOUR FOR THE FIRST PRESERVATION NO YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZED THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR GIVING US AT OUR WE HAVE -- QUITE A LONG LIST BUT WE HAVE. AN ELEVEN PM -- HARD STOP. AND WE WANT TO GET EVERYBODY BECAUSE COMMENTS IN [inaudible] OF WE'RE GOING TO BEG BEGIN WITH FAN FONG LINE FOR FONG ONE SORRY -- AND THEN FOLLOWED BY -- MATTHEW FRIEDMAN. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU CHAIR HOTEL IN THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AND TIMELY TOPIC. THAT START WITH TODAY'S ENERGY LANDSCAPE AND CELEBRATE OUR SUCCESSES A LITTLE. CALIFORNIA'S ACCOMPLISH MAJOR STEPS ON RENEWABLE ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE STATE HAS PURSUED AGGRESSIVE GHG REDUCTIONS. FROM ELECTRICITY SECTOR TO LEAD A BROADER STEAK -- A SUSTAINABLE LOW CARBON ECONOMY. AS A KEY PARTNER IN THIS TRANSITION. P. GENIUS ENTRY INTO HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTS TO BUY RENEWABLE ENERGY. P. JEANNIE HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO ENERGY STORAGE CONTRACT. TO SPUR JUST NASCENT TECHNOLOGY FOR LOW CARBON FUTURE. IN TOTAL BGS COMMITTED THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS BY SIGNING OVER THREE HUNDRED RENEWABLE AND ENERGY STORAGE CONTRACTS. AND AS A RESULT OUR PORTFOLIO IS OVER 80% G. SHE FREE WE HAVE FAR SURPASSES 33% REQUIREMENT BY THE YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY HEALTHY INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SUCH AS P. GINNY HAVE BEEN KEY TO FINANCING DISTASTE TRANSITION. SUSTAINABLE LOW LOW CARBON ECONOMY. HOWEVER TO LECTURE CITY SECTOR. AS IN EARLY TO VOIGTS BEEN CHANGING RAPIDLY. IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR P. GENIES. SUPPLY SERVICE. THE THREE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THIS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE. THE FIRST IS THE RAPID EXPANSION FOR RETAIL CHOICE AVAILABLE FOR CALIFORNIA. THAT INCLUDES DIRECT ACCESS AND COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION. THE SECOND IS THE INCREASES IN DISTRIBUTED GENERATION. PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. AND THE THIRD IS THE ONGOING SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. LET'S TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT YOU SHOVEL. COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION HAS BECOME MORE PREVALENT ALTERNATIVE TO FIJI SUPPLY SERVICES. PGA A SEIZE CCA'S EXPAND IN JUST A FEW YEARS ABOUT 40% OF OUR CUSTOMERS. AND MOST OF THESE ARE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. WE ADDED DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS SELLING ELECTRICITY SUPPLY TO OUR INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THAT BRINGS US TO BOB 55% NEXT YEAR. THIS IS A HUGE CHANGE P. JEANNIE WHEN ALL SERVE TO MINORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS. AND AS TO COMPARE TO TO HIDE A DEREGULATION. P. JEANNIE STOSUR. 75280% SO NOW WE'RE DOWN TO FORTY FIVE THE SECOND DISTRIBUTED GENERATION. MPG SERVICE TERRITORY HAS ALSO INCREASED CONSIDERABLY OVER THE LAST DECADE. THIS IS MOSTLY THE INSTALLATION OF ROOFTOP SOLAR TO RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. AND STUDENTS DUE TO THE LOWER PANEL BECAUSE INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS. AS WELL AS A CALIFORNIA'S NET ENERGY MEETING. GLASS IS ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND AS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EACH YEAR WE SAVE 122% OF OUR CUSTOMERS USAGE. THERE HAS BEEN CALL SHIFTED AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER UNDER THIS CHANGING STRUCTURE. CALIFORNIA SO I USE INCLUDING P. JEANNIE WE ALWAYS SUPPORTED CUSTOMERS RIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIR ELECTRICITY SUPPLIERS. PROVIDED THE EXERCISES CHOICE DOES NOT COST CAUTIOUS TO THE REMAINING CUSTOMERS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CPC ISSUED A VERY NEW IMPORTANT DECISION. P. JEANNIE AND THE OTHER UTILITIES COMMANDER CPUC ON A SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT TO MAKE THIS TIMELY NECESSARY CHANGE THE MECHANISM IS CALLED POWER CHARGE. INDIFFERENCE ADJUSTMENT. UPDATED IS ADJUSTMENT HAVE MADE OF FAIR. TO ALLOCATE COSTS ON BEHALF OF ALL CUSTOMERS AND REMEDY TO COST SHIFT. LARA FROM DEPARTING LOW TO BUNDLE LOVED. ADDITIONALLY P. GENIES ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CPC LATER THIS YEAR UNDER SIMILAR REVIEW. OF THE D. G. MECHANISM TO CORRECTIVE. KASHA FROM ROOFTOP SOLAR. AND I'VE BEEN IN THAT THE COSTS OF UPGRADED ONE BILLION DOLLARS. A YEAR IT'S NOT AN ISSUE. LET'S TURN TO TODAY'S HIGH MARKET PRICES AT THE POTENTIAL FOR RELIABILITY CONCERNS. AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF INCREASED CUSTOMER CHOICE WERE ALSO SU STORY SEEING OF NORMAL HIGH. PRICES IN THE EYES SO MARKET ON JULY TWENTY FOURTH OF LAST SUMMER. THE HIGH SO EXPERIENCE AND YOU PRICES HITTING THE FIRST SET CAP OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MEGAWATT HOUR. THE FREQUENCY OF SUCH HIGH PRICES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF LAST YEAR. JUST LAST MONTH WE ALSO HAVE MANY HIGH PRICES DO LOCK IN LARGE PART TO NATURAL GAS WORKING CONDITIONS. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT SEEN PRICES AS HIGH SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND ONE ENERGY CRISIS. THESE HIGH PRICES ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE DURING. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE ARE MANY OF US WHO BELIEVE THESE HIGH PRICES WOULD BE TO LEAD LEADING INDICATOR FOR RELIABILITY CHALLENGES TO COME. IS A VERY EVIDENT THAT OUR INVENT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. AND THAT THIS AGGREGATION OF THE RETAIL MARKET IS LEADING US INTO UNCHARTED WATERS. SOLUTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY. WHAT ABOUT A CENTRAL BUYER? A CENTRAL BY STRUCTURE HAS EMERGED AS A SOLUTION THAT CAN PROVIDE COST EFFICIENCY. MARKET CERTAINTY RELIABILITY ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER PROTECTION DOES SOUND PRETTY GOOD DOESN'T. THE STARTED THIS DISCUSSION EMERGED IN TWENTY JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CPUC. POSTED A CENTRAL BY STRUCTURE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO IMPLEMENT WHAT'S CALLED A MULTI YEAR RESOURCE ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS. P. JEANNIE BELIEVES THAT -- LEGISLATIVELY. ESTABLISH DESIGNATED SPECIAL EIGHTY IS THE IDEAL CENTRAL BUYER. THIS DESIGNATED ENTITY WOULD BE FINANCIALLY STABLE NEUTRAL. SUBJECT TO THE COMMISSION'S OVERSIGHT PROMOTING THE STATE'S GOAL OF EFFICIENCY CERTAINTY RELIABILITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE A CENTRAL BY STRUCTURE COULD BE EXPANDED BEYOND THE LOCAL ARE A IN TO CLEAN ENERGY POLICY PROCUREMENT MANDATES. BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT OUR PS DEFICIENCY OR EVEN FOR FLEXIBLE AND SYSTEM OUR RACE. THE CENTRAL BY ALSO WE NEED TO BE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED FOR THE TOO SOON THIS ROLE. TURNING TO P. GENIES THOUGHTS ON CENTRAL PROCUREMENT. P. GENIES OPEN. THE DISCUSSION SURROUNDING CENTER PROCUREMENT. BEYOND THAT SOLELY TO RESOURCE ADEQUACY BUT THEIR COMPLEX ISSUE SO WE NEED SOME TIME TO RESOLVE. WERE OPEN TO DISCUSSING BECOME A WIRES ONLY COMPANY THAT PROVIDES ONLY TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES. THE KITTY KEY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED BEFORE WE HEAD DOWN THIS PATH. NUMBER ONE IS THAT WE HAVE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL GENERATION PORTFOLIO WE STILL HAVE DIABLO CANYON. THE BIGGEST INVESTOR OWNED YOUR A UTILITY HYDRO RESOURCES IN THE COUNTRY. AS WELL AS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED GAP OCT ABOUT EARLIER THERE HAS TO BE A CLEAR PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. SO THAT THIS IS BACKSTOPS FOR ALL CUSTOMERS. NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND WOULD PROVIDE OF LAST RESORT. THIRTY IT'S A SEPARATE BUILDING AND A RATE DESIGN STRUCTURE THAT CLEARLY SEPARATES AGREE CHARGES VENDOR AND JUST SUPPLY CHARGES. I'LL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU AND AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THE SEGREGATION OF THE MARKET. YES IN YOUR OPINION. IS IT THE SERVER CATION. LEE TO RELIABILITY CONCERNS FOR YOU GOING INTO THE FUTURE LIKE. IN THE INTERIM I MEAN. THIS YEAR ARE WE LOOKING AT RELIABILITY CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THIS YEAR I BELIEVE WE'RE LOOKING AT HIGH PRICES. AND POSSIBLE RELIABILITY CONCERNS BUT HE'S COMING IN FUTURE YEARS DO YOU THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE SEGREGATION. I BELIEVE YES I DO AND HISTORICALLY DO UTILITIES HAVE SERVED EIGHTY PLUS PERCENTAGE OF OUR LOAD. AND WE STEP FORWARD TO MAKE SURE SOME OF THE LOCAL RELIABLE UNISON ALWAYS THERE. AND WE NO LONGER HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE ARE NO AND THE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR HILL I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF I HAVE TO TO MAKE A COMMON ISSUE AYE AYE AYE YOUR COMMENT THAT P. GINNY SUPPORTS CUSTOMER CHOICE IN IT AND THAT YOU HAVE. HISTORICALLY YOUR COMPANY. HISTORICALLY FOR EVERY EFFORT FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS OF YOUR CUSTOMERS TO CHOOSE IT ANOTHER SOURCE OF ELECTRIC POWER WITH THE RICH PROPOSITION A SIXTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER FORTY MILLION I I JUST DID. IT AMAZES ME TO HEAR THAT THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME AND TELLING THIS COMMITTEE THAT YOU SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS OF OF OF CUSTOMERS. TO DO THAT AND THAT IS SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH. SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT QUESTIONS MY THE CREDIBILITY OF EVERYTHING ELSE YOU SAID TODAY [inaudible] OKAY. DID YOU WANNA RESPOND. I WOULD I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE HAVE TO GRADERS PENETRATION CCAC CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE TO TRY TO FACILITATE -- THIS EVENT AND HAPPENING. OKAY THANK YOU. OF MATTHEW FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE MARKET AND SOME PRINCIPLES AND NEXT STEPS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THIS YEAR. CUSTOMER CHOICE AND EVOLUTION OF THE CURRENT MARKET. CREATES ALL SORTS OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES WHILE ALSO POSING THREATS TO THE TO THE SUCCESSFUL ACHIEVEMENT. OF DEFINED STATE POLICY OBJECTIVES CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. AND STABLE MARKETS. REGULATION CERTAINLY HAS ITS FLAWS AND THE CALIFORNIA P. YOU SEE IS A HIGHLY IMPERFECT ENTITY AS WE ALL NOW. BUT EXPERIENCE SINCE THE DEREGULATION DEBACLE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE PROVES THE STATE CAN ACCOMPLISH SUBSTANTIAL RESULTS THROUGH SMART REGULATION. DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF THE PURCHASING BY LOW SERVING ENTITIES AND THE EXERCISE A BROAD ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. SO THE STATE SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO REPLACE BROAD OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. WITH PROMISES THAT LOCAL CONTROL OR COMPETITION OR CUSTOMER PREFERENCES PROVIDE A COMPLETE SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT FUNCTION. ON THE ENERGY CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND ONE TWO THOUSAND WAS DRIVEN IN PART BY A LACK OF COORDINATED PLANNING. AND A NEAR COMPLETE RELIANCE ON MARCH HOUSE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WE CAN'T MAKE THAT SAME MISTAKE AGAIN. ON TODAY WE FACE A CLASSIC COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM WHERE EVERY INDIVIDUAL BUYER IN THE MARKET. WANTS TO PROCURE RESOURCES BASED ON THEIR OWN PREFERENCES. EVEN IF THE LARGER SYSTEM NEEDS ARE LEFT UNADDRESSED. THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR STATE REGULATORS NEED TO BE PREPARED TO MAKE SOME HARD CHOICES IN THE DAYS AHEAD. NOT ASSUME THAT ALL COMPETITIVE ACTORS ARE GOING TO BE SATISFIED BY THE POLICY CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED. BUT LIKE TOPPER COUPLE PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE ACTION FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE INDIFFERENT TO THE CHOICES MADE BY OTHER CUSTOMERS. IN OTHER WORDS -- THE DECISIONS MADE BY ONE SUBSET OF CUSTOMERS CAN'T FRUSTRATE THE COLLECTIVE ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR SHARED POLICY GOALS. OUR CUSTOMER CHOICE ISN'T VALUABLE IF IT MAKES IT HARDER TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOMES. AND SECONDLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT CUT THE CHOICES MADE BY ONE SET OF CUSTOMERS DON'T SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEGACY COST TO OTHER CUSTOMERS. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF THESE BATTLES OVER COST ALLOCATION OVER TERRACE FOR DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES OVER EXIT FEES. THESE ARE EFFECTIVELY CUSTOMER VERSUS CUSTOMER CHOICES IT'S WHICH SET OF CUSTOMERS PAY -- AND IN MANY CASES AS MUCH AS I WOULD TO PAY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT'S ARGUING ABOUT IN FRONT OF THE COMMISSION WERE ARGUING ABOUT WHICH SET OF CUSTOMERS PACE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WERE FAIR [inaudible] I CAN. WE NEED TO ESTABLISH COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS AND VIABLE MECHANISMS TO ACHIEVE ARE DEFINED OBJECTIVES WHAT'S THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS THE COMPETITIVE ELECTRICITY MARKETS ARE TYPICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY SHORT TERM COMMITMENTS AND SHORT TERM CUSTOMERS. DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS HAVE RELIED VERY HEAVILY ON SHORT TERM PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES TO SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND NEW COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS ALSO RELY PRIMARILY ON SHORT TERM PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES. MORE MATURE CCA'S HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MIGRATED TO MORE LONG TERM COMMITMENTS AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT. BUT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES THEY'VE BEEN THE GOLD STANDARD HISTORICALLY FOR DRIVING YOU RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT -- AND THAT'S BECAUSE NEW RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES LONG TERM COMMITMENTS AND STABLE CREDIT WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES. BUT GOING FORWARD WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MARKET ALMOST ALL OF THE NEW RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET OUR STATES GOALS. ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE DRIVEN BY THE COMPETITIVE PORTION OF THE MARKET SERVE BY COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS. SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO MODIFY OUR POLICIES OR COME UP WITH NEW MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THERE. ON THE OUR PS PROGRAM IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ELEMENT OF THE STATE'S CIMATE POLICY -- BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO BE A SILVER BULLET WE ALSO HAVE AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS. THAT PROCESS IS -- IN AN INTERESTING AN INTERESTING CROSS XIN ISSUED YESTERDAY BY THE PC POINTS TO SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN THE COMMISSION'S OWN PROCESS. AND THE FACT THAT THE PLANS COMING IN SO FAR SIMPLY AREN'T ADDING UP -- AND RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THAT POLICY IS GOING TO HAVE TO OF ALL. ME AND UNDER THE OUR PS PROGRAM AS WAS MENTIONED A FEW MINUTES AGO THERE'S A REQUIREMENT 465% OF ALL PROCUREMENT. USED FOR COMPLIANCE TO COME FROM LONG TERM CONTRACTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WELL IT'S TWENTY NINETEEN WE'VE GOT TO GET THERE QUICKLY AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT EVERYBODY'S GONNA MAKE IT. SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS THIS COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM OF THE ISSUES WERE FACING IN THE MARKET. AND THIS IS WHEREWE SEE THE NEED FOR A CENTRALISED BACKSTOP MECHANISM FOR PROCUREMENT -- I THINK THE WORD BACKSTOPS IMPORTANT HERE. BECAUSE IT INDICATES THAT THERE IS A DESIRE TO LET LOW SERVING ENTITIES DO THEIR SHARE -- ASSEMBLE THEIR PORTFOLIOS AND HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE STATE'S NEEDS BUT WHEN NEEDS ARE ON MATT. THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ENTITY TO STEP IN WELL TODAY WE HAVE TO BACKSTOP MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN USE ONE THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. UTILITIES HAVE BEEN THE LEVER THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMISSION HAS PULLED REPEATEDLY TO SAY GO DO THIS THING MAKE IT HAPPEN WE NEED MORE RESOURCE ADEQUACY -- WE NEED MORE OF THIS AND MORE OF THAT THAT NUMBER IS IS INCREASINGLY BROKEN. ON THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THEMSELVES ARE FORMING THAT FUNCTION WE HAVE AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY IN BANKRUPTCY OTHERS FACING CREDIT CHALLENGES. AN OVERALL CONVERSATION ABOUT MAKING THE UTILITIES SKINNIER IN THIS RESPECT TURNING THEM INTO MORE WIRES COMPANIES. ON THE OTHER BACKSTOPS MECHANISM IS THE CALIFORNIA ISO THEY DO BACKSTOP RETIREMENT FOR RELIABILITY. THROUGH SINGLE YOUR CONTRACTS AND MAY BE THROUGH MULTI YEAR CONTRACTS WHAT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH RELYING MORE ON THE CALIFORNIA I SO -- THEIR DECISIONS AREN'T SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY ANY STATE AGENCY. OR BY THIS LEGISLATURE. THE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. SO GREATER RELIANCE ON THE ISO TO PERFORM THE CENTRAL ROLE. EFFECTIVELY MEANS TURNING OVER MORE RESPONSIBILITY TO FORK AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE FOR THAT WE HAVE TODAY IN THE APPOINTEES -- WHO ARE CONTROLLING THE PROCESS THERE I DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA WANTS TO SEE MORE HAVE ALREADY TO THAT AGENCY AT THIS TIME? ESPECIALLY SINCE BURKE HAS EXPRESSED A STRONG PREFERENCE. FOR CENTRALIZED FORWARD CAPACITY MARKETS THAT HAD BEEN WIDELY CRITICIZED IN THE EAST FOR RAISING CUSTOMER COSTS AND FRUSTRATING STATE RESOURCE PLANNING GOALS. SO THE NEXT STEP SHOULD BE THE CONSIDERATION OF A SEPARATE ENTITY. TO PERFORM THIS DEDICATED PROCUREMENT ON A BACKSTOPS BASIS IT COULD EITHER BE MANDATORY PROCUREMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE SAYS MUST HAPPENING CAN'T BE EASILY ALLOCATED. IT COULD BE COORDINATED PROCUREMENT OF RESOURCE ADEQUACY. I COULD BE CURING ON MATTER RESIDUAL NEED THAT'S IDENTIFIED IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS AND COULD ALSO BE A VOLUNTARY OPT AN ENTITY. FOR LOW SERVING ENTITIES THAT NEED HELP MEETING FOR EXAMPLE THEIR LONG TERM CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE OUR PS. THE BIG QUESTION IS THIS A STATE AGENCY OR IS IT AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH -- IF A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS MOVES FORWARD AT THE END OF THIS IS TO HAVE A ROBUST MECHANISM. WELL WE ALSO PRESERVE THE AUTONOMY OF COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MAKE THEIR OWN RESOURCE PLANNING CHOICES. I THINK THIS OFFERS AN APPROACH THAT CAN RECONCILE A LOT OF OUR COMPETING OBJECTIVES -- AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WE NEED TO DEVELOP THIS MECHANISM BEFORE THE NEXT CRISIS HITS. ON THE MISTAKE OF THE ENERGY CRISIS WAS THAT WE TRY TO RESTRUCTURE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IN REAL TIME WHILE MARKETS WERE MELTING DOWN WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT THAT LONG. WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF THE CURVE THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WILL GO -- TO DÃ¢N WHITES OF WITH THE THE CLEAN ENERGY CALIFORNIA CLEARLY CHOICES SO SITUATION AND KENDALL HOW LONG. OF WOULD SEND US ELECTRIC. IF WE CAN. MAKE ROOM HERE IN THE DÃ­AS THINK. THE MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY. MY NAME IS DONNA EYES AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF KELSEY CA AND ALSO THE CEO OF AND C. E. THE FIRST COMMUNITY CHOICE PROGRAM FORMED IN CALIFORNIA BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AT TODAY THEIR NINETEEN CALIFORNIA CCA'S IN OPERATIONS SERVING AN ANNUAL LOAD. OF THIRTY THREE THOUSAND GIGAWATT HOURS PER YEAR. THAT'S ABOUT EQUAL TO THE LOAD SERVED BY P. JEANNIE WHICH IS NOW. LOAD OF ALL THREE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES OR AREAS. SO CLEARLY WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A TREMENDOUS PARADIGM SHIFT. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED CCA BY -- IS A VISION TO LOCALIZE AND DEMOCRATIZE THE ENERGY SECTOR. TODAY THE ENERGY LANDSCAPE HAS REINVENTED ITSELF BUT THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE HASN'T QUITE CAUGHT UP. THE CPUC WAS SET UP TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST THE INHERENT PROFIT DRIVE OF I'LL. AND TO TRY AND KEEP GIANT UTILITIES FROM FAILING. THAT REGULATORY MODEL RELIES ON CENTRAL DECISION MAKING TOP DOWN DIRECTION AND EXERTING CONTROL OVER LARGE POWER PROVIDERS. THE MODEL IS NECESSARY WHEN DEALING WITH LARGE FOR PROFIT UTILITIES BUT IT FALLS APART WHEN IT'S APPLIED TO SMALL AND MID SIZED PUBLIC POWER PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THIS NEW MODEL. IS SET UP WITH THE DIRECT WITH THE PUBLIC HAVING DIRECT INPUT INTO THE ELECTRIC PROVIDERS DECISIONS AND THE PUBLIC CONTROLS THE LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS MADE UP OF MAYORS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND COUNTY SUPERVISORS. ELECTRIC SUPPLIERS ARE INHERENTLY MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE AS WE ARE GOVERNED BY THE BROWN ACT AND THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. OUR CUSTOMERS AND LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS HAVE ALREADY BUILT ENERGY AGENCIES THAT ARE INTIMATELY ORIENTED TOWARDS REASONABLE COSTS FINANCIAL STABILITY AND EXCEEDING STATE STANDARDS FOR RENEWABLES AND GHG REDUCTION. WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE RENEWABLES AND GHG FREE POWER IN OUR PORTFOLIO THAN THE I'LL USE TODAY WITH LONG TERM CONTRACTS. WHEN THE CPC REGULATORY CULTURE IS APPLIED TO PUBLIC AGENCIES THE TOP DOWN MODEL DRIVES UP COSTS FLOWS DOWN PROGRESS AND PREVENTS CREATIVE TRANSPARENT LOCAL SOLUTIONS? IS NOT INHERENTLY BAD SYSTEM BUT IT WON'T WORK IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT. AND WEN WE ADD IN P. GENIES MULTIPLE SAFETY FINANCIAL AND CREDIT FAILURES. AS WELL AS THE CLOSE REGULATOR RELATIONSHIP MANY HAVE NOTICED BETWEEN P. JEANNIE AND THE CPSC. I AGREE THAT IT'S TIME TO REVISIT THE REGULATORY FOCUS. WHAT'S EXCITING IS THAT WE'RE SEEING THE NEW OUT OF THE OLD. ENERGY DEMOCRACY THAT WAS ENVISIONED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO IS TAKING ROOT ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ITS ACCELERATING PROGRESS TOWARDS CALIFORNIA'S RENEWABLE AND GHG FREE GOALS WHILE USING A TRANSPARENT. PUBLIC BOTTOM UP FREE MARK. THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO TO ADJUST TO THE NEW PARADIGM FOR TODAY I HAVE JUST THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST IS THAT THE CPC SHOULD NARROW THEIR FOCUS. TO SAFETY AND I OWE YOU COST MANAGEMENT TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS. THIS MEANS IS THAT THEY WILL ENSURE OR THEY SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE I'LL USE ARE SELLING OFF ENERGY AND RELIABILITY RESOURCES THEY NO LONGER NEED. AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST I. O. U. MARKET POWER. THAT MEANS MINIMIZING -- THE LOS SUNK COSTS AND MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF THEIR POWER FOR RATE PAYERS. THE IDEA YOU SHOULDN'T BE SELLING OFF VALUABLE LONG TERM POWER CONTRACTS INTO THE SPOT MARKET. THEY SHOULDN'T BE ENGAGING IN AD HOC LOW COST SALES WITHOUT A BROADER PLAN AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE THE DEER PARK HYDRA FACILITY BEING SOLD OFTEN PLASTER COUNTY WITH THE SALE PRICE OF ONE DOLLAR. AND NO APPARENT PUBLIC SOLICITATION. THE CPUC SHOULD ALSO BE ENSURING DATA TRANSPARENCY FOR TIME OF USE RATE DESIGN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SMART METERS THAT OUR RATE PAYERS ALL PAID. FOR AND TO ALLOW FOR LOW SHIFTING PROGRAMS AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT WILD FIRE BASED DE ENERGIZING OF POWER LINES. HAPPENS IN A PROACTIVE WAY. MY SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY OF THE COMMISSION THE CDC TO TAKE OVER PUBLIC CCA ENERGY PLANNING ACTIVITIES REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT. THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE TRANSITIONAWAY FROM THE CPSC TO ALLOW THEM TO FOCUS ON SAFETY AND I OWE YOU COST MANAGEMENT. FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE I'LL USE WILL HAVE VIRTUALLY NO ROLE IN BUILDING ENERGY OR RELIABILITY REACHED RESOURCES. THE EASY COORDINATION OF INTEGRATED CA IS AND PUBLIC UTILITIES IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. THAN WITH THE CPUC BECAUSE THAT'S WHO'S DOING THE PROCUREMENT. ON THIS POINT ON ALL ALSO NOTE THAT THE CPC HAS HAD DIFFICULTY PROVIDING ACCURATE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING TEMPLATES TO CCS BECAUSE THEIR MODELS ARE SET UP FOR LARGE I USE. AS A RESULT THE I. R. P. TEMPLATES LAST YEAR WERE BEING ALTERED IN THE MONTH MONTHS WEEKS AND EVEN DAYS LEADING UP TO THE FILING DEADLINE. CCA'S AND PUBLIC UTILITIES ALREADY REPORT TO THE CDC UNDER THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD FOR OUR RELIABILITY OBLIGATIONS AND MANY OTHER COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE. PUBLIC AGENCY PLANNING SHOULD BE ALL IN ONE PLACE FREEING UP THE CPUC TO FOCUS ON SAFETY AND I OWE YOU OVERSIGHT. MY THIRD RECOMMENDATION RELATES TO RELIABILITY PLANNING AND SPECIFICALLY IN NEED FOR CLEAR REQUIREMENTS WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT RELIABILITY WE AGREE THAT WE ALL NEED TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON THE CHALLENGE WITH RELIABILITY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. IS PARTLY DUE TO OUR INTENDED TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUEL BASED RESOURCES BUT ONE KEY ISSUE THAT. HAS NOT BEEN A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION IS THE LACK OF CLEAR REQUIREMENTS FOR LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TO FOLLOW. JUST LIKE ENERGY PLANNING WE SHOULD SHIFT RELIABILITY PLANNING AWAY FROM THE CPUC AND CREATE CLEAR REQUIREMENTS OR A LIABILITY. A DEFINED BY CASE SO BECAUSE THEY HAVE BETTER MARKET INTELLIGENCE. AS WEST WITH THE PLANNING FUNCTION ABOVE THE CPC IS NOT EQUIPPED TO CORRECTLY MANAGE RELIABILITY AND IT ONLY TAKES AWAY FROM WHAT SHOULD BE THEIR CORE FOCUS ON SAFETY AND HOW YOU COST MANAGEMENT -- IF I MAY PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THE CPUC HAS CHANGED RELIABILITY FILING REQUIREMENTS WITHIN MONTHS OF THE FILING DEADLINE AFTER MANY LOW SERVING ENTITIES HAD ALREADY PROCURED. TO MAKE THINGS WORSE LAST FALL THE CPC THAN REDUCE THE REQUIRED ALLOCATION SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE FILING DEADLINE COSTING CCA'S SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF ACCESS RELIABILITY PROCUREMENT. WITH CLEAR STANDARDS SET BY CHI SO THE RELIABILITY NEEDS SHOULD BE MET BUT ANY RESIDUAL NEED NOT COVERED COULD THEN BE PURCHASED BY HI SO OR A THIRD PARTY. JUST LAST MONTH FIVE TO SEE IF YOU CAN WRAP UP NOW ABSOLUTELY I'M JUST OF THE TALENT HERE WANTED TO NOTE THAT JUST LAST MONTH FIVE CCA'S ISSUED A SOLICITATION FOR JOINT ARE A LOOKING TO BUY A BIG CHUNK OF RELIABILITY. AND THEIR COMBINED LOTUS TWENTY THOUSAND WHAT HOURS. PRETTY BACK ABOUT HALF THE SIZE OF P. JEANNIE ONE LAST NOTE THE WILDFIRE THREAT THAT WILL CAUSE MORE ROUTINE AUTOMATIC OUTAGES IN FIRE PRONE AREASWILL JEOPARDIZE RELIABILITY FOR CRITICAL CUSTOMERS LIKE HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY CENTERS AND MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS. CCA'S WANT TO PARTNER WITH THE CPUC AND I'LL USE TO BUILD IN BACKUP SUPPLY AND RESILIENCY BUT WE NEED ACCESS TO DATA AND WE NEED JOINT COOPERATION TO SUCCEED. FOR OUR SHARED COMMUNITIES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE AS WE ENTER THE NEW PARADIGM THANK YOU WAS GOING HOME. RIGHT GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN HUESO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS ENERGY SUPPLYING CALIFORNIA AND HOW IT WILL EVOLVE TO MEET BOTH STATE AND CUSTOMER INTERESTS. I PLAN ON ADDRESSING THREE TOPICS TRENDS IN SAN DIEGO A CENTRAL BUYER AND THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. LET ME BEGIN WITH AN UPDATE ON DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR TERRITORY. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FIFTH THE SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL VOTED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CCA THROUGH ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY INTENDED TO INCLUDE OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE COUNTY.% THEIR GOAL IS TO BE UP AND RUNNING AND PROVIDING ENERGY TO CUSTOMERS BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF WE INCLUDE JURISDICTIONS WITH ANTICIPATED INTEREST IN THIS THE SAME MODEL AND CUSTOMER SURVEY THE ONE OPERATING CCA AND OUR TERRITORY AND DIRECT ACCESS. ESTY GINNY COULD BE LEFT SERVING ROUGHLY 20% OF LOAD IN OUR TERRITORY IN JUST A FEW YEARS. THIS TREND IS NOT INCONSISTENT WHAT WITH WHAT WE ARE SEEING ACROSS THE STATE WHERE BY ENERGY SUPPLY IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DECENTRALIZED. IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE MOVING TO A MODEL WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR OVER FIFTY CC IS AN EXPANSION AND THE DIRECT ACCESS PROGRAM. AS A RESULT THE I'LL USE WILL PLAY A SMALLER ROLE IN PROCUREMENT GOING FORWARD. FOR EXAMPLE AS THE GENIE IS CURRENTLY NOBLE PERCENTAGE IS AROUND 45% WELL AHEAD OF OUR COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. WITH ANTICIPATED LOW DEPARTURE OUR MODELS NOW SHOWN THAT ARE NEED TO PROCURE RENEWABLE RESOURCES AS EXTENDED FROM THE MIDTWENTY TWENTIES TO WELL BEYOND. TWENTY THIRTY WELL OUR FORECAST AND ENERGY SUPPLY NEEDS ARE DECREASING PROCUREMENT BY NOT A YOU PROVIDERS IS EXPECTED TO RISE AS DESCRIBED BY PRESIDENT PICKER AND MAIN CLEAN ENERGY. AS THE STATE MOVES FORWARD WITH DECENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT A KEY ISSUE ACING LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS IS COORDINATION OF THAT PROCUREMENT TO MEET A SINGLE GOAL BJ'S TO REDUCTION OF RELIABILITY. THIS COORDINATION QUESTION BRINGS ME TO AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR VISION. WITH THE IDEAS HAVE TRADITIONALLY PROVIDED OPERATIONAL RESOURCES AND THE BALANCE SHEET TO LEAD LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY DIRECTED PROCUREMENT. WE RECOMMEND THAT GOING FORWARD THE EMERGING PLAYERS LEAD THE WAY. IT WILL BE IMPORTANT AT ALL -- THIRTEEN ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RELIABILITY AND CHASE TO PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. BUT WHEN THERE IS A GAP BECAUSE OF DECENTRALIZED A STATE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY OR CENTRAL BUYER COULD BE RELIED UPON TO PICK YOUR RESIDUAL NEEDS. THE SCOPE FUNCTIONALITY AND GOVERNANCE OF THE CENTRAL BUYERS PARAMOUNT TO SUCCESS THE LET ME STATE A FEW POINTS ABOUT OUR POSITION. FIRST RELATES TO THE QUESTION OF WHO WILL BE THE CENTRAL BUYER. WE BELIEVE THE ENTITY MUST BE INDEPENDENT AND FINANCIALLY VIABLE WITHOUT INDEPENDENCE OF THE FUNCTION IS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO LITIGATION AND DISPUTE. AND WITHOUT THE FINANCIAL BACKING TO SECURE RESOURCE FOR FOUR BROAD STREET NEEDS BROAD ST MEANS THE FUNCTION CANNOT BE RELIED UPON AS A SAFETY NET. SECOND RELATES TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT WILL BE PROCURED. WE BELIEVE THE ENTITY SHOULD BACKSTOP RELIABILITY AND GT REDUCTION GOALS BUT THAT CENTRAL PROCUREMENT SHOULD BE LIMITED IN SCOPE THE COLLECTIVE DEFICIENCIES RESULTING ONLY AFTER OTHER LOW SERVING ENTITIES HAVE MADE THEIR PORTFOLIO DECISIONS. THIRD RELATES TO WHY S. DETAINEES SHOULD NOT SERVE IN THIS FUNCTION. BESIDES FAILING TO MEET THE INDEPENDENT STANDARD AS DETAINEES SHOULD NOT SEEK TO REGULARLY TAKE ON MULTI MILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENTS FOR CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE CHOSEN A DIFFERENT ENERGY PROVIDER. INSTEAD WE BELIEVE IT MAKES MOST SENSE FOR US TO FOCUS ON SAFE AND RELIABLE DELIVERY OF CLEAN ENERGY. INCLUDING THE INVESTMENTS NEEDED TO INTEGRATE HIGHER LEVELS OF CLEAN ENERGY ON THE GRID. IN FACT AT A BROAD LEVEL WE BELIEVE IT IS BEST FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS IF WE ACCEPT THE ROLE OF ENERGY SUPPLY. ENERGY SUPPLY ALTOGETHER. AS WE CONSIDER THE OPTION IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE CURRENTLY ACTIVISTS PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT A POLAR. WITH THIS TERM I'M REFERRING TO THE OBLIGATION TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR TERRITORY WHO ARE NOT SERVED BY ANOTHER LEAD SERVING ENTITY. CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT WHO WILL PROVIDE FULLER SERVICE AND AS THE GENIE EXITS PROCUREMENT. IF WE ESTABLISH THAT ALL THOSE SERVING ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME -- LIABILITY AND CHASE TO PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL AS A CENTRAL PRIOR TO BACKSTOP ANY GAPS THE POLAR SERVICE IS SMALLER IN SCOPE. SIMPLY PUT THE POLAR SERVICES LIMITED TO PROCURING DAILY ENERGY NEEDS FROM THE CHI SO FOR A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS IN THE STATE. I'VE DONE ELSEWHERE THIS FUNCTION CAN BE PROVIDED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF ENERGY SUPPLIERS AUCTIONED OFF OR PROVIDED BY THE CENTRAL BUYERS WELL. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT AS TEACHING HE RECOGNIZES THE PROCUREMENT LANDSCAPE IS CHANGING. WE EXPECT IT IS CENTRAL AS MODEL CAN WORK IF IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE BELIEVE NOW IS THE TIME TO ENSURE THE RULES REGULATIONS INSTRUCTIONS ARE PUT IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THIS FUTURE MARKET PLACE. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND BEFORE WE CHANGE A PANEL JUST WANT TO ASK. EACH OF YOU. THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED. THE REPRESENTED FROM P. JEANNIE REGARDING -- THE SEGREGATION AND HOW IT'S AFFECTING THE MARKET PLACE AND WHETHER IT'S CONTRIBUTING. TO RELIABLE REAL RELIABILITY CONCERNS. EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. IF YOU COULD JUST. BRIEFLY GIVE GIVE ME A RESPONSE TO THAT. SURE THANK YOU SENATOR -- I THINKA JURY STILL OUT ON WHAT THE RESULT IS GOING TO BE IN TERMS OF RELIABILITY WERE HEARING ANECDOTALLY ABOUT GREATER CHALLENGES OF FINDING RESOURCES AND SOME OF THE LOCAL AREAS -- THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN A SLOWDOWN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW RESOURCES AND SOME OF THE LOCAL AREAS THAT ARE NEEDED. COMBINED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF EXISTING FACILITIES ON THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW WE'RE GONNA PLAN ESPECIALLY IN THE LOCAL AREAS TO MEET RELIABILITY NEEDS AND IF WE IF WE RELY ON A SYSTEM WHERE EVERYONE GETS TO CHOOSE WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO BUY IN THE LOCAL AREA AND BUYS. A LITTLE BIT OF THIS AND A LITTLE BIT OF THAT -- AND THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED COORDINATION AROUND THAT WE MAY VERY WELL GET SUB OPTIMAL RESULTS -- AND UNLESS WE MAKE SURE THAT GENERATION IS BUILT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME OR WE HAVE DEMAND SIDE RESOURCES THAT CAN PROVIDE THAT SAME FUNCTION. WE MIGHT BE HEADING TOWARDS -- SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF PRICING AND SO THE GOAL WOULD BE TO AVOID THAT BUT AGAIN JURY STILL OUT. THANK YOU. BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO GINNY'S TERRITORY ANY RELIABILITY CONCERNS THAT HAVE EMERGED REALLY RELATE MUCH MORE TO THE EXISTING GENERATION -- THAT'S NEEDED IN THE LOCAL AREA GOING FORWARD UNDER TO CENTRALIZE MODEL I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE CENTRALIZED PLANNING. AND AND THAT SOME AGENCY OR OR THERE'S SOME WAY. TO ENFORCE THE REQUIREMENT THAT ARE PUT UPON AFRAID LOW TECH UNITY. I'M AT ALL RESPOND TO THE QUESTION UP FIRST BY CLARIFYING THAT WHEN WE DID THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST REGARDING THE WAIVERS THAT WERE FILED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONE I OWE YOU FILED A WAIVER FOR A LIABILITY ONE D. A CUSTOMER FILED A WAIVER. NINETY S. P. IS FILED A WAIVER AND ZERO CC IS FILE THE WEATHER WHAT A WAY FOR SOMEONE TO TO CORRECT THE RECORD ON THAT POINT -- WHEN A LARGE ENTITIES SERVING HALF THE STATE FAILS IT'S A DISASTER? THIS SEGREGATION IS A AND ANOTHER VERSION OF DIVERSITY -- IN FINANCE WE ARE TOLD TO DIVERSIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO I'M IN THE ENERGY SECTOR IT'S NO DIFFERENT DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S CREATING RELIABILITY CONCERNS. NO I BELIEVE THAT WITH GOOD PLANNING AND COORDINATION WE WILL HAVE A STRONGER SYSTEM WITH THE SOCCER CATION WE HAVE THAT GOOD PLANNING NOW. I THINK WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR PLANNING OKAY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU DID YOU WANNA ASSN. OKAY WELL WE'LL GO TO WE DON'T KNOW. QUESTION WHAT I WOULD DO IT NOW BECAUSE FOR YEAH. I JUST I JUST A QUICK QUESTION OF THE CCA'S OF YOUR NINETEEN ARE ANY STEEL. PURCHASING REX. I'M TO MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE NINETEEN CCA IS -- I THERE ARE -- I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY THAT ARE PURCHASING RACKS BUT I THINK WHAT YOU MEAN IS ON BUNDLED OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS ARE ALSO CALLED DOCKET THAT. MORAN WAS PURCHASING FROM SHELL. JUST A FEW YEARS AGO SO. I'M NO THAT IS NOT ACCURATE -- P. JEANNIE -- WAS NOT PURCHASING UNBUNDLE CONRAD INTERVIEW WAS NO I'M THE CEO OF AND C. E. AGAIN WITH MC A SENSE BEFORE ONE WELL I WISH YOUR UTILITIES AT THE TIME AND YOU GUYS WERE PURCHASING. RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS FROM SHELL OIL. THAT'S NOT ACCURATE OKAY ARE THEN I'M GONNA BE AN ACCURATE THAT. IS ME I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE I WAS ON THE NAPA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AT THE TIME AND THAT'S WHY VOTED NO. ON M. C. BECAUSE YOU WERE USING SUBSTANTIAL RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDIT SO I I DON'T KNOW WHERE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS COMING FRIDAY. THANK YOU I HAVE LOTS OF CONSTITUENTS THERE ON THE PROGRAM. SO YOU KNOW I I'VE I'VE COME AROUND I'M LISTENING AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT HEARING YOU SAY THAT. I MEAN JUST TO THE POINT THAT -- MISTER HILL MADE ABOUT THE P. JEANNIE IT MAKES ME QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF YOUR TESTIMONY BEFORE BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S TRUE. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISSED INFORMATION CIRCULATED ABOUT AND C. E. SINCE OUR LAUNCH -- THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE WERE PURCHASING UNBUNDLED RENEWABLE CREDITS BUT WE HAVE -- TRANSITION AWAY FROM THAT I OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND IT'S BEEN ZERO FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I'M HAPPY PROVIDE YOU WITH DETAIL. BUT I JUST. READ A FURNACE AND WE NEVER PER TWO THAT'S RIGHT I DIDN'T SAY NO HI YEAH I KNOW I SAID ANYWAY LAST QUESTION -- I'M I'M GOING AWAY EASY YOU SAY THIS IS COMMUNITY CHOICE. BUT IF IT WAS TRULY COMMUNITY CHOICE YOU AN OPT FOR OP INVERSES OPT OUT TO ME THIS IS COMMUNITY FORCE HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM. OCCUPYING COMMUTING INTO YOU LIBERATE YOURSELF BECAUSE I GUARANTEE IF YOU PULLED. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS NOT 10% NO THEY'RE PART OF CCA AND I BET EVEN LESS THAN THAT KNOW WHAT IS TO SERIOUS SO HIGHS IS TRULY COMMUNITY CHOICE. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SENATOR BRADFORD AND I'D LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT THAT NO CUSTOMERS CHOSE TO BE A CUSTOMER OF ON I OWE YOU -- THAT TRULY WAS A MODEL THAT WAS CREATED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN YOU HAD VERY FEW OPPORTUNITIES DO YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY WERE YOU OUT. HOLDEN WIRES ALL IT HAPHAZARDLY AROUND IT WAS DUE FOR THE SIMPLICITY OF HAVING A UNIFIED. GREER AND A DELIVERY SERVICE VERSUS MULTIPLE SUPPLIERS THAT WOULD HAVE TOLD CHAOS IN YOUR COMMUNITY HAVE OUTAGES ALL DAY LONG SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT MIKE I COMPLETELY AGREE -- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WITH A CCA THERE ACTUALLY IS A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT ENTITIES PROVIDING SERVICE PRIOR TO SEE CA THERE ACTUALLY ISN'T CHOICE UNDER MONOPOLY PARADIGM. AGAIN IF IT WAS TRULY CHOICE YOU WOULD OPT FOR OBTIENT VERSUS OPT OUT AND MY LAST THING YOU SAID YOUR SUPPORT OF OF DIVERSITY AND OB PURCHASING THE PROCUREMENT BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR YOUR ONE FIFTY SIX DIVERSITY IN YOUR CCA'S WHICH IS LACKING. VERY MUCH SO IN FACT LAST WEEK WE HELD OUR LOCAL VENDORS TO COME AND GET SIGNED UP TO BE GEO ONE FIFTY SIX CERTIFIED -- WE GO THROUGH A RIGOROUS PROCESS TO OF THAT OUR VENDORS AND OF FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON DIVERSITY AND WE HAVE -- ANNUAL REPORTING ON THAT WE LOOK. FOR TO WELL FED US. I MEAN JUST A CLEAR OFF THEIR BECAUSE WERE WAY OVER ON TIME. WE'RE GONNA. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE COMMENTS AT THE END RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE IF IF WE GET THROUGH THIS ALL RIGHT I JUST CAN'T DO THIS OF FOR FIRST OF ALL MISTER CHAIRMAN I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU HOLDING THIS HEARING -- I KNOW WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST PANEL YET BUT I THINK IT'S GIVEN US. A LOT OF DETAIL TODAY ON MANY THINGS WE'VE HEARD SOME SIGNIFICANT THINGS. LIKE UNCHARTED TERRITORY REPLY ABILITY ISSUES. PRICE UNCERTAINTY NEED FOR CENTRALIZED PLANNING -- THE TESTIMONY FROM TURN I LIKE WHAT I'VE HEARD IN THE PAST WAS QUITE CREDIBLE I THINK HE DID AN OUTSTANDING. JOB SETTING THAT SAID SETTING THE TABLE THERE WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR CCA'S ONE THING THAT I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. IS THE ABILITY AND THE OBJECTIVITY THAT NEEDS WE CANNOT GET TO A POINT WHERE THIS UNCHARTED TERRITORY JUST SHOWS UP AND THEN ALL SAID WE HAVE I I I'M JUST GONNA PUT THIS OUT THERE I THINK WHEN THE STRIKE TEAM THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS -- YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD -- DO MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR FIRES EVERYTHING THAT MAYBE THEY BE DELEGATED THIS TASK OF LOOKING INTO THIS AND MAKING A RECOMMENDATION. BACK BUT I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE. YOUR WHERE MOST OF US. OUR REPRESENTING CCA'S I AM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO GO YES ALL MY LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS IT ALL THE COUNTIES I HAPPEN -- IT IN I THINK THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT HAPPENING IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE CAN NOT. PUT OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS IN HARM'S WAY I HOPE. HIS WIFE IS CORRECT IN WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT THEIR AT PLANNING AND THEIR ABILITY TO PLAN. BUT SOMEWAY SOMEHOW BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO FALL BACK ON US WE HAVE TO TRUST [inaudible] BUT VERIFY. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE NEXT TIME AROUND PERRY. OF TO COME FORWARD AND FOLLOWED BY COLIN CUSHIONING. THAT ONE OF THE ON AIR LIVING. GOT YOUR GEAR BUT THE THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING MY CALIFORNIA BASED EMPLOYEE OWNED COMPANY COMMERCIAL ENERGY TO REPRESENT DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS AT THIS TABLE. FOR A KID THAT WENT TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL OF WHAT AVENUE IN NORTH HIGHLANDSAND WAS THE BOYS STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE ALMOST FORTY YEARS AGO TO THIS PLACE IT'S MY HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. AS AN ACTIVE ESP IN THE NATURAL GAS AND POWER MARKETS FOR OVER TWO DECADES COMMERCIAL ENERGY BRINGS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. WHILE 36% OF INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS USE OVER FIVE THAT USE OVER FIVE HUNDRED K. W. BY THROUGH AN ENERGY PROVIDER ONLY AGRICULTURAL CUSTOMERS DO. ON THE OTHER HAND 95% OF THE DIRECT AXIS METERS OR LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED K. W.. AND THE ONLY REPRESENT 37% OF THIS DIFFERENCE IN PRISON IN PENETRATION RATES HIGHLIGHTS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IN THE GO TO MARKET ISSUE FOR THE GRID. HOW DO WE EMPOWER SMALLER SEE AN AYE CUSTOMERS TO ENGAGE IN THE CARBONIZATION? WE THINK YOU DO THAT BESTER EXPANDING DIRECT ACCESS AND WE SEE FOUR LEGS TO THAT TABLE. FIRST ALLOW THE PCI A FACE TO PROCEEDING TO FINISH ITS WORK IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. KNOCK ON WOOD. SECOND. ALLOW THE CARBONIZATION OF THE EXISTING BUILDING INVENTORY BY ELECTRIFYING NATURAL GAS FIRED HEATING SYSTEMS AND ON SITE GENERATORS AND EMPOWERING -- EVEY CHARGING STATIONS SINCE ALMOST 20% OF OUR CO TWO COMES FROM BUILDINGS AND 50% FROM THE TRANSPORTATION GRID. THIRD DELIVER TIME OF USE RATES TO FULLY PRICE THE COST OF THE LATE AFTERNOON RAMP ESPECIALLY DURING THE DARK AND STILL DAYS OF WINTER AND THE HOT AND HOTTER SUMMER DAYS. AND LASTLY DIVERSE SYFY STATEWIDE PORTFOLIO RISK BY ALLOWING E. S. PIECE TO COMPETE IN BRINGING THE SOLUTIONS TO THE SEA AND I MARKET PLACE INSTEAD OF ONLY FIFTEEN POINT 4% THAT YOU'VE ALLOWED US TO TODAY. WE SEE DIFFICULT IN ACCOMPLISHING THE CARBONIZATION WITHOUT COMPLETE DA OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE IN NATURAL GAS OF FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. pOF THE PC I A OR ALLOWING PCIE TO FINISH ITS BUSINESS THE KEY FINDINGS THERE ARE TO ESTABLISH A METHODOLOGY TO REDISTRIBUTE THE EXISTING ASSETS WHETHER OUR A. R. P. S. OR BROWN ENERGY. TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKET PLACE. COMMERCIAL ENERGY PROPOSED EVALUATION ALLOCATION AN AUCTION. CLEARING HOUSE TO SET THESE PRICES AND THESE ASSETS AND THIS OUTPUT TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS IN AFFECT OUR BACK PROPOSAL IS SIMILAR TO THE CENTRAL PROCUREMENT WITHOUT THE MANDATE. CUSTOMERS VOLUNTARILY CUSTOMERS EXCUSE ME ESPN'S VOLUNTARILY CAN TAKE THEIR ALLOCATION OR AUCTION INTO IT ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS ON THE LONG TERM ASSETS WHAT THIS DOES IS ELIMINATES THE RISK WE CONTINUE TO DOUBLE PROCURE. TOO MUCH SOLAR AT NOON AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM WE TALK ABOUT VOLATILITY OF HIGH PRICES YOU ALSO GET VOLATILITY OF LOW PRICES. I'M A PRETTY GOOD QUANTITY THIS KIND OF STUFF AND THAT'S WHY G. AT NOON. ESPECIALLY IN SOLELY IN IN THE VALLEY SWEAR YOU HAVE THIS ACCESO BACK LECTURES CITY UP AND THEN YOU SEE THOUSAND DOLLAR POWER AT EIGHT PM BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T EMPOWERED TO SEE AN AYE CUSTOMERS TO HELP MITIGATE THAT LOAD. SECOND WE NEED TO DE CARBONIZED EXISTING BUILDING YOUR INVENTORY AND IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN JUST CHANGING CODES. RETROFITTING LEG LEGACY BUILDINGS LABORIOUS SITE BY SITE WORK REQUIRES COMPETENT USUALLY UNION CONTRACTORS AND TRUSTED FINANCIAL ANALYST TO QUANTIFY TRUE COSTS AND PAY BACK. BUT SINCE 50% OF THE P. JEANNIE NATURAL GAS COURSE SUPPLY TO SMALL AND MEDIUM COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES IS PROVIDED BY CTA'S LIKE MY COMPANY -- AND BY THE WAY YEAH WE ARE THE LEADING SELLER IN THAT SPACE. WE LOSE THAT GAS BUSINESS AT LEAST GIVE US A CHANCE TO KEEP IT BY SELLING THEM ELECTRICITY TO OFFSET THE LOSS ON THE GAS SEEMS FAIR TO ME. ARMED WITH THEIR HOURLY IN MONTHLY USAGE INFORMATION AN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW AND WHEN THEY USE ENERGY AND THEIR FINANCIAL RISK THE CUSTOMER'S DECISION BE DRIVEN BY TOTAL ENERGY COSTS. NOT JUST THE SUPPLY. AND WE'LL FINANCES BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE BALLOT SHE TO DO IT AND SO DO MY COMPETITORS. THIRD DELIVERING REAL TIME RATES TIED THE CHI SO PRICES IS ALSO ESSENTIAL WHILE THE NEW UTILITY TERRACE RECOGNIZE THE ENERGY IS MOST EXPENSIVE FROM FIVE TO NINE THIS POSTAGE STAMP SIMPLICITY OF ONE PRICE ACROSS THE PERIOD IS INSUFFICIENT. TO CHANGE MOST CUSTOMERS BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE THE UTILITY AND THE CPUC CANNOT QUICKLY ENOUGH PROVIDE A REAL TIME TEAR FROM REAL PRICE SIGNALS NEED TO SHOW FOR CUSTOMERS. TODAY THE CCA SIMPLY COPY UTILITY RATES LESS ONE OR 2%. BUT YES P. RATES HAVE TO BE BASED THIS AGAINST BECAUSE CLIENTS ACTUAL HOURLY USAGE THAT'S HOW WE PRICE AND THEN WE HAVE A COMPETITOR BUSINESS UP ON MARGIN RIGHT. GOOD FOR THE CUSTOMER E. S. P. RATES BASED ON THAT REFLECT THE TRUE RAMPING COST TO MEET THE SEVEN PM PEAK AND AN E. S. P. E. PASSES THROUGH THOSE ON CONTRACTS ARE MITIGATES THEM THEMSELVES. BETWEEN THE PROFIT MOTIVE OF AN ESP AND THE BUDGET CONTROL MODE ABOUT THE BUSINESS. DIRECT ACCESS STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE OF MARKET SIGNALS OF BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE FINALLY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO RISK IS JUST PRUDENT POLICY WE ALL KNOW THAT A TOP DOWN APPROACH OF PICKING TECHNOLOGIES OF THE YEAR AS PRESIDENT PICKER KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY CREATING SUBSIDIES IS NOT LONG TERM GOING TO BE. THE BEST READ THE READ THE PCI A TRANSCRIPTS ON HOW WE ARGUED ABOUT THE PRUDENT SEE OF OF PAST DECISIONS. YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE. MAGNIFY THE TECHNOLOGY RISK BY THE GO TO MARKET RISK OF HAVING ONLY ONE OR TWO ALLOWED ENERGY SUPPLIERS 485% OF THE MARKET. MULTIPLY THAT BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE CC A BUSINESS MODEL. AND YOU HAVE A RECIPE THAT'S NOT GONNA TASTE VERY GOOD. FLAVOR THAT WITH THE UNCERTAINTY OF HOW WHEN AND IN WHAT CONDITION P. GINNY WILL EXIT BANKRUPTCY. AND WHAT THE OTHER UTILITIES WANT TO DO WITH THEIR PROCUREMENT FUNCTION. WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL IS THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE OPTIONS A CUSTOMER HAS AND THAT DIVERSIFICATION LIKE A STOCK PORTFOLIO QUOTING SOMEONE ELSE IS ESSENTIAL TO LONG TERM SURVIVAL AND GROWTH? RELYING ON MULTIPLE ACTORS TO BRING DE CARBONIZATION TO THE SCENE I MARKET PLACE SERVES AS A BACKSTOP TO THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE. IN CONCLUSION WE SIMPLY ASK YOU FOR WHAT I ASKED THE YEAR ON BOND FOR TWO YEARS AGO. A TEN YEAR HORIZON TO OPEN UP TO RIGHT. SENATOR HERTZBERG. FOUR THOUSAND IS A GOOD START IN THAT DIRECTION THE E. S. P. SKILLS OF DEVELOPING DEPLOYING AND FINANCING ENERGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO FULFILL KNOWN RUN NO NEEDS IS AT THE HEART OF OUR MISSION. THINK OF THE S. P. IS AS MANAGING DEMAND AND DELIVERY COSTS OF A BUSINESS THERE 45% OF THE BILL. WHEN ANY SB HELPS THE CLIENT LOWER THERE IS USAGE OR DEMAND TO EARN AS MUCH LOYALTY AS THE SUPPLY? AND WHEN THE E. S. P. FINANCES THOSE RETROFITS THEY ARE CREATING LONG TERM ASSETS ON THE GRID TWO D. CARBONIZED THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR CUSHIONING. YES THANK YOU OF OF MARBLE CHERUB HOW HUESO AND HANNAH MEMBERS OF THE S. SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE -- MY NAME IS COLIN CATCHING ON THE VICE PRESIDENT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY'S -- ENERGY PROCUREMENT RULES OF MARKET OPERATIONS AND THE LIMITED -- POWER PLANT OPERATIONS THAT WE HAVE. WITH THE UTILITY THIRTY TWO YEARS AND I'VE SEEN A LOT IN MY RELY ON THAT EXPERIENCE AND SOME OF THE REMARKS THAT MAKE HERE. MOST NOTABLY I WAS VERY MUCH INVOLVED WHEN CALIFORNIA I MOVED WITH THE B. EIGHTEEN NINETY AND I'LL REMIND THIS COMMITTEE I RESPECTFULLY THAT. A AB EIGHTEEN NINETY MOVED ON A UNANIMOUS VOTE EVERYONE SUPPORT IT MAYBE BECAUSE EVERYONE GOT SOMETHING IN NOBODY'S STEP BACK IN AND LOOK AT WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS COULD BE -- BUT THE REVOCATIONS EXIST TODAY ALMOST TWENTY YEARS LATER STILL BEING PAID FOR BY OUR CUSTOMERS. ACROSS THE STATE AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN -- SO AGAIN MY MY COMMENTS WILL -- WILL FOCUS ON THAT TO A BET -- WE'RE A LOT THIS MORNING AND AND QUITE FRANKLY DON'T THREE FOUR MINUTES IS JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME TO TO REALLY GIVE IT THE OTHER CONVERSATION IT NEEDS SO INSTEAD OF THE MADE. JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY PRINCIPLES AND A FEW ISSUES -- THAT I THINK NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY AND I CERTAINLY WELCOME ANY INVITATION TO RETURN TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN MORE DETAIL. IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE ITS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS WE HAVE TO DO SO IN A MANNER THAT MAKE SURE ELECTRICITY IS AFFORDABLE. AND RELIABLE FOR ALL CUSTOMERS ON WHAT I'M HEARING -- RIGHT NOW IS A DISAGGREGATED MODEL WHERE WE'RE GONNA CREATE -- ELECTRICITY PRODUCTS THAT MEET CERTAIN CUSTOMERS NEEDS BUT MAYBE NOT OTHERS. IN THE GRID AS EVERYONE KNOWS IS GREATLY INTERCONNECTED THE GREAT CANNOT OPERATE INDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER SO THAT IS WHY CENTRAL PLANNING IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT -- SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER THE FORUM. ARE CCA'S OUR E. S. P.'S OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR PO USER CONNECTED TO OTHER KINDS SO -- GRAD THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING IN CONCERT TO ACHIEVE OUR SHARED GOALS. AS A TO DO THIS WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED -- UP PLANNING PROCESS SB THREE FIFTY CREATED -- INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS P. -- TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK. HOWEVER THE CCA'S IN HIS PIECE OF THE CPC OF SOON WHICH WILL BE MORE THAN 50% OF THE CPC'S JURISDICTIONAL LOAD. HAVE BEEN LARGELY RESISTANT -- TO HAVING THEIR I. R. PEAS ARE AROUND THE PROCUREMENT THAT THEY WILL DO -- DIRECTLY REGULATED BY THE CPC. AND THIS IS JUST UNTENABLE OUR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC GRID NEEDS TO BE PLAN FOR A THOUGHTFUL COMPREHENSIVE MANNER. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS OPERATING AGAIN AS I SAID IN IN CONCERT FOR THE BETTERMENT OF ALL. OF THE GRID IT'S NOT THE INTERNET. IT'S A COMPLEX MECHANISM. YOU CAN'T JUST ADD STUFF TO IT HOPE IT ALL WORKS IT HAS TO BE BUILT IN THE RIGHT LOCATIONS WITH THE RIGHT ATTRIBUTES THAT HAS TO BE OPERATED FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE NOT FOR A FEW. AND IT HAS TO BE ESSENTIALLY PLAN TO GET THERE. SO I I SORT OF TO THE QUESTIONS THAT I HEARD EARLIER THAT THE CPC DOES NEED MORE AUTHORITY OVER OUR E. S. P. ISN'T CCA'S FOR SOME ENTITY NEEDS MORE AUTHORITY. TO MAKE SURE THE COLLECTIVELY ON EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED WILL ACTUALLY MEET OUR NEEDS. THE AMOUNT OF CENTRAL PROCUREMENT THAT'S NEEDED I DON'T HEAR ANYONE DISAGREEING ABOUT CENTRAL PROCUREMENT THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR IT. I'D SAY THE AMOUNT OF SUCH A PROCUREMENT THAT WE NEED IS DIRECTLY A FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH SHE IS PEAS AND CC IS ARE WILLING TO BE OVERSEEN AND THEIR RETIREMENT. IF THEY'RE WILLING TO HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF REQUIREMENTS THEN THE CENTRAL PROCUREMENT CAN BE SMALL. IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO RELY ON THEIR CITY COUNCILS AND AND COUNTY SUPERVISOR PORTS TO TOM WHAT TO BUILD THERE WILL BE LARGE GAPS TO DEVELOP HONOR SYSTEM. AND THE CENTRAL BUYERWILL HAVE TO DO A LOT OF PROCUREMENT AND OUT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AND THAT WILL BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WERE EFFECTIVELY DOUBLE PROCURING RESOURCES. THAT WE COULD HAVE SECURED AT THE OUTSET OF MET ALL THE NEEDS. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE I'M IN I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS HOW IT WOULD HAVE WORKED OUT BUT WE HAVE CCA'S RIGHT NOW AND THAT THERE FORMING IN SANTA MONICA BEVERLY HILLS. ON BUT IF WE NEED RESOURCES IN SANTA ANA HER SUPERIA ARE THEY GOING TO BUILD THE RIGHT RESOURCES IN THOSE LOCATIONS IF THEY BUILD THE RESOURCES THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WANT. ALL WILL BE GREAT BE RELIABLE FOR EVERYONE BUT WE HAVE ROLLING BLACKOUTS WE BLACKOUT EVERYBODY EXCEPT FOR SOCIAL SERVICE CUSTOMERS. SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE WE DON'T PRETEND THAT SOMEHOW LETS SERVING IDEAS ARE NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE GRID THAT EXISTS TODAY. WHO SHOULD BE THE CENTRAL BUYER -- I SUBMIT THE LEGISLATURE'S ALREADY DECIDED AS THE LEGISLATURE. INSTRUCTED -- THROUGH -- SB THREE FIFTY ON THAT THE CPC INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO DO RELIABILITY PROCUREMENT SYSTEM AND LOCAL AND RECOVER THOSE COSTS ON A NON BY PASSPORT CHARGE BASIS FROM ALL CUSTOMERS IT'S CALLED THE CAMERA COST ALLOCATION. BACK BACK IN HIS ROOM. AND THE UTILITIES HAVE DONE THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS PROCUREMENT SINCE MID LAST DECADE FOR RELIABILITY IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WE HAD A NEAR ENERGY SHORTAGES. OF DURING PEAK DEMAND AND UTILITIES WERE ORDERED BILL THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF THE CAMP. RECENTLY WITH OUR AGING GAS FIRED RESOURCES RETIRING ALONG THE COAST AND BECAUSE OF WANTS TO COOLING -- REQUIREMENTS OF THE CPC HAS HAS AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF ASSN ORDERS TO CONSTRUCT CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW CLEAN RESOURCES FOR THE MOST PART. HOW TO REPLACE THOSE OLD GAS FIRED RESOURCES AND ALL CUSTOMERS WILL PAY FOR THAT AND THAT WILL KEEP THE LIGHTS ON? BUT WE HAVE OTHER ISSUES COMING UP IN THE NEAR TERM -- EDISON IS RIGHT NOW SOCIALIZING ANALYSIS WITH CPC STAFF AND CAL ICE OF STAFF. pWE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IS IS IT AS EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH CAPACITY ON THE SYSTEM FOR ALL THOSE CERVANTES TO MEET THEIR RESOURCE ADEQUACY CREEK. AS THE REQUIREMENTS. OF MAYBE SEVERAL THOUSAND MEGAWATT SHORT. OF WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEPEAK LOAD ON THE SYSTEM IS SHIFTING TO THE EVENING. THINK ABOUT SEPTEMBER THE SUN DOESN'T SHINE IS TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE PEAK LOAD MAY BE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT THERE WILL BE NO CNTRIBUTION FROM THE THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR THAT THE CCA'S ARE CONSTRUCTING. THAT WILL THAT WILL MEET THAT WE NEED LOTS OF OTHER THINGS TO MEET THAT SO IT NEEDS TO BE SEXUALLY PLANNED IT NEEDS TO BE DONE AWAY THIS AFFORDABLE RELIABLE FOR EVERYONE. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED -- I I WILL FINAL COMMENTS HERE DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS. THE THE STATE'S SOLVED A LOT OF THE ISSUES THATYOU HEARD TODAY ON FOLKS MAYBE JUST DON'T WANNA RECOGNIZE THAT IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL -- THE UTILITIES ARE THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. GUESS WHAT UTILITIES SERVE ALL CUSTOMERS FOR THE WIRES THE UTILITIES HAVE RELIABILITY FUNCTION IT MAKES SENSE FOR UTILITIES TO BE THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. UTILITIES DO RELIABILITY PROCUREMENT -- UTILITIES HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO A LOT OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS WE ARE UTILITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OF ABOUT 40% OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE LARGEST RENEWABLE FULLY IN THE STATE -- THE YOUNG UTILITIES GO THROUGH LONG TERM PROCUREMENT PLANTS AND I ARE PIECE TO MAKE SURE SYSTEMS A RELIABLE SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HERE THAT ALREADY EXISTED THE STATE FIGURED OUT THROUGH THE ENERGY CRISIS. SIR IF YOU CAN WRAP UP NOW AND NOW NOW THE ISSUE IS HOW DO WE BRING THE CCA'S IN HIS PIECE IN THE FOLD. AND RECOGNIZE BEING A C. C. A. R. E. S. P. AS AN ELECTIVE. DECISION YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IS HE SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN YOUR OF THE GRAD TOGETHER ON THAT SB FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER ON THAT THANK YOU. AND I'M GONNA COME BACK WITH SOME QUESTION RICK RICK REGARDING AGGREGATION DOESN'T CREATE RELIABILITY CONCERNS IN THE FUTURE. MAYBE BEGINNING WITH -- MISTER PERRY THEN [inaudible] I THINK. DEPENDING ON HOW YOU WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM -- STATEWIDE AGGREGATOR STATEWIDE ALREADY ASSUMING WE DID NOTHING TODAY. OR T WOULD HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE UNDER THE CURRENT. CONDITIONS WELL PART OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE TO BE DETERMINED IN THE PC I A FACE. TO I DO BELIEVE THERE REALLY A RELIABILITY CONCERNS I KNOW I BILL I BELIEVE THAT. THE UTILITY HAS A BETTER LOAD FORECASTING TOOL THAT I HAVE AVAILABLE TO ME ON A CUSTOMER BY CUSTOMER BASIS RIGHT IF COLIN SAYS MR CHRISTIAN SAYS THAT WERE SHORT A COUPLE THOUSAND MAKES IN THE FUTURE AND WE'RE SHORT PROBABLY A COUPLE THOUSAND MAKES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WHAT THAT MEANS IT WAS WE HAVE TO EMPOWER SOLUTIONS WHETHER AND THE BEAUTY OF CNI IS YOU CAN DO THOSE SOLUTIONS LOCALLY IF YOU NEED THEM? THE ENERGY IN HYSTERIA. TALK TO THE BUSINESSES IN THIS AREA WE'RE TALKING YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD A PLANT IS VERY OR IF I HAVE A CLIENT IN HYSTERIA I'LL PUT A PLAN HAS VERY AT THE CLIENT SITE BECAUSE I CAN WHICH WHICH COULD TAKE YEARS. IT TOOK US A YEAR TO PUT A ONE AND A HALF MAKE A WATCH BATTERY STORAGE SYSTEM EL CAMINO HOSPITAL THE LARGEST BATTERY STORAGE SYSTEM BEHIND THE METER THAT BEEN INSTALLED AT THE TIME TWO YEARS AGO. OKAY. MISTER CHRISTIAN EVENT YOU FOR THE QUESTION YES I THE PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT PROCESS THAT WE WILL HAVE RELIABILITY ISSUES. NO ONE LOC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING THAT WAS THE PROBLEM DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS NOBODY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR LIABILITY EVERYONE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROFITABILITY. SO WE HAVE A PROBLEM. VERY BRIEF CENTER VERY BRIEF. DESCRIPTION A AYE IN YOUR CLEAR YOU WERE WITH THE COMPANY DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS WOULD YOU AGREE THAT ENRON WAS NOT A UTILITY COMPANY -- ENRON WAS NOT A UTILITY COMPANY AND HOW DIFFERENT IS THE CCA THAN ENRON THEY'RE JUST SUPPORTER OF POWER WHICH YOU'RE GREAT. OF THE THAT THE DIFFERENCE THE DIFFERENCE THAT I I I WOULD I WOULD MAKE BETWEEN CCA AN ENRON IS THAT. YOU'RE CCA'S ARE LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR COLLECTIVE CITIZENS INTERESTS JUST LIKE AND ROMS LOOKING OUT FOR ITS COLLECTIVE CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS INTERESTS. BUT THOSE INTERESTS DON'T EXTEND TO THE GREAT MORE BROADLY THEY DON'T EXTEND TO ALL THE OTHER CUSTOMERS. OKAY WE'RE GONNA COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] NOW OF AND IF PEOPLE WANT TO LINE UP. ON THE MIKE IF BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE A DEPENDS ON HOW MANY SPEAKERS WE GET WE ONLY HAVE THREE MINUTES. AND ANYBODY ELSE -- WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUBMIT YOUR COMMENTS IN WRITING TO THE COMMITTEE WILL PASS MOPPED MEMBERS [inaudible] SIR. WHAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA MINISTRY TO LEASE THE STATION REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC AND UTILITIES THAT PROVIDE ELECTRICITY ABOUT 25% OF CALIFORNIANS? LOOK FOR TO ENGAGING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE. RELIABILITY IS PRETTY MUCH JOB NUMBER ONE FOR OUR MEMBERS IN ADDITION TO AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY -- WE OPERATE OUR MEMBERS OPERATE UNDER A DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES SO TO THE EXTENT THE COMMITTEETHE LEGISLATURE'S LOOKING AT SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED TODAY -- SUCH AS A STATEWIDE CENTRAL PROCUREMENT AGENCY PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TOWARDS THAT END THANK YOU. THE MORNING LISTA BROWN ON BEHALF OF EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY SCCA SERVING ALAMEDA COUNTY ELEVEN OF ITS CITIES -- ONE OF THE THE CONCERNS THE PC BROUGHT UP WAS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN RESOURCES ARE BEING FOUGHT LONG TERM. AND THAT DOESN'T STACK UP TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS -- REFLECTS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE PC OF WHAT IS HAPPENING CCA'S HAVE BEEN RAMPING UP QUICKLY TO MEET. THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND A LOT OF NEW PROCUREMENT IS UNDER WAY WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN THE COMING MONTHS WE HAVE INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THE OAKLAND CLEAN ENERGY INITIATIVE WHERE. ABC IS PARTNERING WITH P. JEANNIE TO MEET A RELIABILITY NEED IN THE DOWNTOWN OAKLAND AREA. AND ALLOW FOR THE THE RETIREMENT OF AN OLD PETER PLANT THERE -- AND WE'RE USING -- WE'RE MAKING INNOVATIVE USE OF SMART METER DATA IN A WAY THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE TO DESIGN RATES WITH AN EYE TOWARDS ENCOURAGING OF TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION AND BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION IN OUR LOCAL AREAS. I WERE ALSO JOININGTOGETHER TO ISSUE RFPS WHEN IT MAKES SENSE TO DO SO TO SEGREGATION IS NOT A PROBLEM PER SE -- CENTRAL PLANNING SHOULD MEAN TELL US WHAT YOU NEED AND WE WILL FIND THE OPTIMAL WAY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THANK YOU VERY WORDS WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND JUST -- IF I COULD MAKE JUST FINAL COMMENTS THANK YOU'S TO EVERYBODY THAT PARTICIPATED AND I I REALLY APPRECIATE. EVERYONE COMING FORWARD AND GIVING SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO HOW TO FIX THE SYSTEM WHETHER YOU WERE ON ONE SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT OR THE OTHER I I THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS OR PUT FOR JUST INITIALLY JUST LISTENING THEM SOUND. LIKE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY -- EXCLUSIVE OR OR AT WORK AGAINST EACH OTHER I THINK A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF IMPLEMENTED TOGETHER CAN ACTUALLY HELP. OVERALL WITH THIS IN THIS THIS WOULD THIS RADICAL COARSER OF WHAT REQUIRE A MORE THOROUGH DEBATE PUBLICLY BUT I APPRECIATE THOSE COMING FORWARD. I I AM VERY CONCERNED LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY AS I'VE HEARD TODAY AND ANOTHER COMMITTEES. THAT WE DO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS GOING ON FORWARD AND AND AND AND UNLESS THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT. OR IF -- WITHOUT SOME -- REFORM AND HOW ARE. ENERGY IS PROCURED AND HOW IT'S BALANCED AND AND HOW. WE CAN PROVIDE A LEVELING OF THE PLAYING FIELD WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME RELIABLE BILLY PROBLEMS GOING FORWARD. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO CREATE A YOU KNOW A SYSTEM IN OUR STATE WHERE THERE ARE SOME MORE FORTUNATE PEOPLE IN SOME AREA OF THOSE OF THE STATE AND OTHERS THAT BEAR. A HIGHER BURDEN WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE IN AND LESS RELIABILITY OR HIGHER RATES. OR IN SHOULDERING THE COSTS OF OF OTHER AREAS AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED. REGULARLY IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW HOW WE CREATECOUNTIES AND CITIES AND AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND AND HOW WE HAVE IMBALANCES IN PROVIDING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO PEOPLE IN EDUCATION -- PEOPLE IN HOUSING. YOU KNOW I JUST HATE TO SEE US CREATE A SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO CREATE INEQUALITY IN ENERGY -- DISTRIBUTION -- TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT MAY THAT MAY BE THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT NOW. BUT IF IT'S GONNA GET WORSE UNDER THE THE STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW IF NOTHING IS DONE NOTHING IS CHANGED IF WE DON'T REALLY FOCUS ON WORKING TO CREATE. A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN ADDRESS OUR OUR SAFETY CONCERNS. AND AND OUR ARE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS [inaudible] OF YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA WORKING AT CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE WHERE. ARE YOU YOU ARE CAN YOU CREATE -- YOU KNOW SOME AREAS WHERE AREA OR ENERGY AS AS CHEAPER AND MORE RELIABLE AND OTHER IT'S WORSE NOT [inaudible] AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS OFF THIS YEAR OR IN THE COMING YEARS. AND AND THIS IS REALLY -- BEEN VERY EDUCATIONAL -- HEARING FOR ME SO THANK YOU EVERYBODY WHO PARTICIPATED. AND IF ANYBODY ELSE WISHES TO MAKE COMMENTS -- I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SEND. YOUR REACTIONS IN YOUR COMMENTS TO MY OFFICE AND WILL DISTRIBUTE AND TO MEMBERS SO WE CAN HEAR EVERYBODY'S VOICES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY
