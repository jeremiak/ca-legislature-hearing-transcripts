OF HOW THAT MONEY CAN BE PUT TO

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:56.434
GOOD USE BECAUSE THE WORST

00:28:56.501 --> 00:28:57.969
THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS. WE

00:28:58.036 --> 00:28:59.437
SPEND TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:01.172
SHORT ORDER. AND AT THE END OF

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:05.610
THAT DAY. IF HOMELESSNESS DOES

00:29:05.677 --> 00:29:06.744
NOT DROP. WE WILL BE ONE. WHY

00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:07.612
WE DIDN'T REQUIRE MORE

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:08.746
ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS MEASURE

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:10.281
IS REALLY CHEAP DISPELS REALLY

00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:11.483
TRYING TO. TRYING TO GRAPPLE

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:13.852
WITH THAT- I WILL ALSO SAY

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:17.555
THAT- THAT- I HEAR THE

00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:18.990
SUGGESTION THAT WE SHOULD NOT

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:20.358
BE HOLDING CITIES ACCOUNTABLE

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.060
FOR THE RESOURCES. THAT THEY DO

00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:23.695
NOT HAVE AND I CAN AGREE WITH

00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:25.130
THAT MORE WHICH IS WHY THIS

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:27.365
BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS. THAT

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:28.433
CITIES CANNOT BE HELD

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.001
ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY DON'T HAVE

00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:31.436
THE RESOURCES TO TACKLE IT WHAT

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:32.570
THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:35.273
REALLY. ANALYZE WHAT IS THE GAP

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.242
BETWEEN- THE LEVELS OF

00:29:37.308 --> 00:29:38.443
HOMELESSNESS IN ANY CITY OR

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.379
COUNTY- AND REGION. AND WHAT

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:42.547
RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:46.484
ADDRESS IT- AND WE WOULD REALLY

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:47.619
ONLY BE ASKING CITIES AND

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:49.387
COUNTIES. TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:51.156
THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE. BUT

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:52.390
IT'S ONE ASPECT OF THIS BILL

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:53.625
THAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO KNOW THE

00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:55.793
GAP BETWEEN WHAT. WE NEED TO

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.428
REVERSE THIS WHAT WE HAVE SO

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:58.463
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE

00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.497
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:00.765
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESOURCES

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:03.234
SO- ENCLOSING EVERYONE KNOWS.

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:05.069
THIS IS THE MORAL CRISIS OF THE

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:07.505
DAY. WE NEED TO HOLD OURSELVES

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:08.706
ACCOUNTABLE TO ADDRESSING THAT

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:09.641
AND WITH THAT AT THE

00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:12.277
APPROPRIATE TIME I HOPE THAT

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:13.044

ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CITIES WHERE

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:33.865

00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:35.667
UNDERPERFORMING. ALL OF US

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:37.268
PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO SERVE ON

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:38.803
THIS COMMITTEE KNOW THAT CITIES

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.271
DON'T BUILD HOUSING BUT THEY

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:41.339

TO PREVENT PROJECTS AN EIGHTY

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:48.479
TWO FIFTEEN WOULD MAKE SURE

THROUGH THE RENEWAL PROCESS IN

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:58.156
THREE WAYS FIRST REQUIRE CITIES

00:30:58.223 --> 00:30:59.257

GIVE A LITTLE- BROADER

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:19.904
EXPLANATION OF WHY. WE HAVE

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.873
THAT AS SOMETHING THAT EACH CD

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.608
COMES DOWN IN CITIES ABOUT.

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:26.610
THIS SEEMS TO BE KIND OF OUT OF

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:27.745
CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:29.647
DO TO MOVE OUR CITIES IN THE

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.248
RIGHT DIRECTION AND LOOK FOR

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:34.051
THE OPPORTUNITIES TO- NEED RAIN

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:36.020
NINE AND OUR CERTAINLY. OUR

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:37.755
BALANCE OF HOUSING IN IN THEIR

00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:41.458
COMMUNITIES. CERTAINLY SO A

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:42.760
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AGAIN FOR

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:43.861
THIS BILL AS WE KNOW WE ARE

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:46.063
ASKING. THE STATE AND CITIES TO

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.365
PUT A TON OF TIME AND- TO

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:49.733
DEVELOPING HOUSING ELEMENTS IN

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.636
RENO. AND ONCE HOUSING HOMES

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:54.872
ARE DOTTED BASICALLY. NO ONE

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.907
REALLY LOOKS AT THEM AGAIN FOR

00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:58.075
EIGHT YEARS TO SEE IF CITIES

00:42:58.142 --> 00:42:59.843
ARE DOING. WHAT THEY HAD

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.378
PLANNED TO DO SO WHAT THIS BILL

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:02.313
IS TRYING TO ADDRESS IS REALLY

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.448
REALLY BAD. WHAT PART OF WHAT

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:05.616
THIS BILL IS SAYING IS FOR

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:06.817
CITIES THAT ARE WOEFULLY

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:09.219
UNDERPERFORMING IN THAT AREA-

00:43:09.286 --> 00:43:11.155
WE WANT THEM TO ACHIEVE THE PRO

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:12.389
HOUSING DESIGNATION WITH THE

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:13.724
PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION DOES

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:15.292
IS. IT SAYS THE CITIES THAT ARE

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.760
DOING A GOOD JOB IN THIS AREA

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:18.595
YOU ARE GOING TO GET IF I COULD

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:19.897
PUT IT THIS WAY. CARATS

00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:22.266
INCENTIVES ARE TO MOVE FORWARD-

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:24.468
THOSE WOULD INCLUDE- BEING ABLE

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:27.905
TO- TO POTENTIALLY GET MORE FOR

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:29.640
MORE FUNDING- AND BEING ABLE TO

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:30.874

OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TO THE

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.477
WORST PERFORMING CITIES. WE

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:34.945
WANT YOU TO STRIVE WITH THE

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:36.780
FLEXIBILITY THAT THE PRO

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:38.615
HOUSING DESIGNATION ALLOWS TO

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.250
STRIVE TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO

00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:42.553
DO TO MAKE SURE- THAT YOU'RE

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:44.088

WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:53.964
THIS VERY ISSUE WHAT IS THE

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:56.467
APPROPRIATE WAY. TO UTILIZE

00:43:56.533 --> 00:43:57.468
WHAT HAPPENED THE CARROTS THE

ONGOING AND I'M COMMITTING TO

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:04.508
ALL STAKEHOLDERS WHO REALLY

REALLY WANT TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.511
AT HOW TO USE TO YOUR POINT

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.079
WHAT HUSBAND STRUCTURED AS SORT

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.914
OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. AS A WAY

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:11.815
TO MOVE EVERYONE BECAUSE

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:14.351
ULTIMATELY WE WANT ALL CITIES

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:15.419
TO BE PRO HOUSE IN CITIES

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.221
IDEALLY EVERY CITY IN THE

00:44:17.287 --> 00:44:18.389
STATE. GETS THE DESIGNATION

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:20.524
BUT- AT THE MOMENT IT'S ONLY

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:22.359

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:23.527
THE BEST PERFORMING CITIES THAT

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:24.962
WILL GET IT. AND THEN WE HAVE A

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:26.330
LOT OF OTHER CITIES THAT LOAN

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:27.431
AND AGAIN PART OF WHAT THIS

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:28.799
BILL DOES IS IT IT SORT OF

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:33.404
BRIDGES PUSHES. THOSE WORST

THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.341
AND IT JUST SEEMS TO BE UPSIDE

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:39.043
DOWN TO ME IT WOULD BE TO ME

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:40.811
HAVING SERVED AT. BOTH LEVELS

THOSE THAT ARE UNDER PERFORMING

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.497
DON'T DO THAT PURPOSEFULLY.

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:02.232
THAT THERE ARE OBSTACLES

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:03.634
WITCHER FEES FIVE AND THE

WHAT OUR CITIES TRY TO DO AND

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:37.468

INSPIRATION FOR THIS BILL FOR

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.744
ME WAS READING A ARTICLE IN THE

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:57.013
LA S. MAGAZINE ABOUT SOME SOME

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.048
REAL SLUM PROPERTIES IN

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.517
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:01.451
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:02.452
ENFORCEMENT THE TENANTS WERE

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:03.620
FORCED TO DO THINGS LIKE USE

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:04.888
ILLEGAL SPACE HEATERS THE

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:09.959
KILLED IN THIS FIRE AND THESE

00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:11.895
WERE TENANTS WHO WERE POWERLESS

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:13.863
TO COMPEL THE SAFETY ON THE

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.965

00:57:16.032 --> 00:57:17.700
BUILDING OFFICIALS IN THAT CITY

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:18.802

ENFORCEMENT ON THIS PROPERTY

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.738
THE UNFORTUNATE FACT IS THAT WE

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:22.639
STILL HAVE A FEW CITIES IN

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:24.407

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:33.183
BE CURRENT ON ALL THEIR RENT

00:57:33.249 --> 00:57:34.317
BEFORE THE LOOK AT WHETHER THE

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.734
PRIVATE COVENANTS THAT DO NOT

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.236
ALIGN WITH LOCAL ZONING. UNTIL

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:29.571
THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:31.139
RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.273
WERE USED AS A TOOL TO

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.742

HAVE MADE RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:41.416
COVENANTS UNENFORCEABLE

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:43.885
THANKFULLY AND- BUT THESE

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:46.054
COVENANTS OFTEN CONTAIN OTHER

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:48.690
VESTIGES OF THIS DISCRIMINATION

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.291
SUCH AS LIMITS ON THE NUMBER

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.594
AND SIZE OF UNITS THAT CAN BE

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.430
BUILT ON A PARCEL. THE DENSITY

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:57.198
RESTRICTIONS ALSO CONFLICT WITH

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:59.267
LOCAL ZONING CODES THAT WOULD

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.169
ALLOW FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING

CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING.

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:08.743
THESE RESTRICTIONS REMAIN

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:16.951
