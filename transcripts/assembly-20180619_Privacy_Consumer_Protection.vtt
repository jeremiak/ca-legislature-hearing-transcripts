GOT COMING UP HERE THIS MORNING

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:14.330
TO CARS WILL SOON DRIVE

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:15.598
THEMSELVES.

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:16.366
ALONG WITH SYSTEMS THAT

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:17.801
RECOGNIZE SPEECH AND FACES

00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:19.102
TRANSLATE DOCUMENTS ORGANIZE

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:21.938
NEWS FEEDS TO FEET GO MASTERS.

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:22.572
EVEN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND SO

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:25.308
ON IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR THE

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:26.576
INSTITUTE CONVENE A MEETING AND

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:28.611
SO MARK CALIFORNIA. TO BRING

00:57:28.678 --> 00:57:29.879
TOGETHER PRIME MOVERS IN A AYE

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.014
AND RELATED FIELDS TO DISCUSS AN

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.515
URGENT QUESTION.

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:34.184
GIVEN THIS RECENT EXPLOSION IN

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.085
CAPABILITY AND ADOPTION OF A AYE.

00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:37.020
HOW DO WE ENSURE OVER THE COMING

00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:38.655
DECADES AYE AYE AYES NOT JUST

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:39.689
POWERFUL?

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:40.757
AND NOT JUST PROFITABLE BUT

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.458
BENEFICIAL.

00:57:42.525 --> 00:57:43.293
WE SEARCH FOR THIS GROUP A

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:44.527
PARTICULAR TASK TOGETHER

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.496
PROPOSALS REGARDING A AYE POLICY

00:57:46.563 --> 00:57:47.831
AND DISTILL THEM INTO A SET OF

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:49.766
PRINCIPLES THE GUY TECHNOLOGISTS

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.734
POLICY MAKERS AND OTHERS.

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.002
THIS PROCESS I WOULD SAY IT

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.903
SUCCEEDED BEYOND OUR

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.438
EXPECTATIONS RESULTING IN TWENTY

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:56.172
THREE PRINCIPLES IS LISTED IN

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:58.041
THE RESOLUTION.

00:57:58.107 --> 00:57:58.641
I WITH EXCELLENT CONSENSUS ON

00:57:58.708 --> 00:57:59.776
THEM.

00:57:59.843 --> 00:58:01.010
THEY BROAD SUPPORT AS WE'VE

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:01.945
HEARD FROM THE HEADS OF A AYE

00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:03.746
RESEARCH A COMPANIES INCLUDING

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:05.715
GOOGLE DE MINED FACEBOOK OPEN A

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:06.816
AYE GOOGLE BRAIN.

APPLE AND OVER A THOUSAND MORE A

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:10.453
AYE RESEARCHERS AS WELL AS

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.588
LEADERS IN THE CALIFORNIA TECH

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:12.722
INDUSTRY LIKE YOU ON MOSQUEIN

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:14.858
SAM ALTMAN AND ACADEMICS FROM

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.759
THE LATE STEPHEN HAWKING. TO A

AYE PIONEER STUART RUSSELL AND

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:19.662
PETER NORFOLK ALSO CALIFORNIANS.

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:20.363
PART OF WHAT MAKES THIS

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:21.364
CONSENSUS POSSIBLE I THINK IS

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:22.632
THAT MANY OF THESE PRINCIPLES

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:23.166
ARE ALMOST SELF EVIDENTLY

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:24.734
DESIRABLE.

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:26.169
WE ALL WANT AND I SYSTEMS THAT

00:58:26.236 --> 00:58:27.537
ARE SAFE THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:28.504
THE RESPECT OUR LIBERTY AND

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:30.073
PRIVACY AND RIGHTS.

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:31.174
SUPPORT OUR SHARED PROSPERITY

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.775
MITIGATE RISKS AND KEEP US

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:34.744
HUMANS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:36.112
WE ALL KNOW THAT THESE DESIRES

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:37.380
ARE FAR FROM SELF FULFILLING

00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:38.648
SAFE TECHNOLOGIES DON'T HAPPEN

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:40.049
BY THEMSELVES PRIVACY IS NOT

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:41.718
AUTOMATICALLY RESPECTED.

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:42.952
CIVIC PROCESSES ARE NOT

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:43.419
INHERENTLY IMMUNE FROM

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:45.088
SUBVERSION.

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.322
ENSURING THAT LOOK BENEFIT OF

00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:47.690
TECHNOLOGY TAKES ACTIVE EFFORT

00:58:47.757 --> 00:58:48.558
AND PARTICIPATION FROM

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:50.493
RESEARCHERS DEVELOPERS POLICY

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.561
MAKERS SUCH AS YOURSELVES AND

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:52.996
THE PUBLIC.

00:58:53.062 --> 00:58:54.497
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AND WILL BE

00:58:54.564 --> 00:58:55.698
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MANY CUTTING

00:58:55.765 --> 00:58:56.733
EDGE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:58.334
INCLUDING AYE AYE.

00:58:58.401 --> 00:58:59.469
IT WAS POSSIBLE IN VITAL FOR

00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:01.204
CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THE LEAD ALSO

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:02.372
AND HOW THOSE TECHNOLOGIES CAN

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:02.906
BE USED FOR THEIR ULTIMATE

00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:05.308
PURPOSE. TO BETTER HUMANS LIVES

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:07.744
AND SOCIETIES FUNCTIONING.

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:08.745
LIKE YOU SAW MY PRINCIPLES IT

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:09.946
ENDORSES THIS PRINT THIS

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:12.215
RESOLUTION DOES NOT OF COURSE BY

00:59:12.282 --> 00:59:12.782
ITSELF REQUIRE ANYONE TO DO

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:15.618
ANYTHING.

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:16.252
RATHER WE HOPE IT WILL INSPIRE

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.754
SIMILAR ACTIONS ELSEWHERE.

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:18.888
AND HELP HIGHLY THESE PRINCIPLES

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.690
A SET OF CORE ASPIRATIONS TO

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:22.258
HELP A AYE REVOLUTION HAPPENED

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:23.259
IN ITS BENEFICIAL AWAY AS

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:24.193
POSSIBLE FOR ALL [inaudible]

DIRECTOR AT THE ELECTRONIC

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.742
FRONTIER FOUNDATION --

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:40.910
PRIOR TO JOINING YET THAT I

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:42.545
RECEIVE MY PHD IN COMPUTER

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:43.713
SCIENCE FROM STANFORD WHERE MY

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.048
RESEARCH FOCUSED ON HOW TO

GUARANTEE SAFETY FOR MACHINE

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:47.984
LEARNING SYSTEMS.

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.118
PART OF THAT IRON MY BACHELORS

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:50.653
DEGREE AT ANOTHER GREAT

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.155
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CAL TECH --

00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.323
WHERE I SPENT MY SUMMERS DOING

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:55.091
RESEARCH ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES?

00:59:55.158 --> 00:59:56.960
NOW PART OF MY AND IT EFF IS THE

00:59:57.026 --> 00:59:58.461
WAY A AYE SYSTEMS WILL IMPACT

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.530
PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES.

01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:01.364
WHEN THE UP THAT WAS FOUNDED

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.799
ALMOST THREE DECADES AGO

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:03.800
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WAS THE

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:04.968
STUFF OF CYBERPUNK SCIENCE

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.936
FICTION STORIES?

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.371
NOW A AYE IS A REALITY AND IS

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.305
VERY QUICKLY PERMEATING OUR

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:11.641
LIVES FROM THE ALGORITHMS THAT

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.276
DETERMINE WHAT ADS WE SEE ONLINE

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:14.911
TO FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS TO

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:16.145
THE SOFTWARE THAT DRIVES

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:17.180
AUTONOMOUS CARS AND THAT'S JUST

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.348
THE BEGINNING.

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:18.848
THE STATE OF THE ART IS

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.750
ADVANCING RAPIDLY.

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:21.884
YEAH I PRESENTS ENORMOUS

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.453
OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:25.555
WORK BETTER FOR SOCIETY BUT IT

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:27.590
ALSO COMES WITH GREAT RISK.

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:28.725
YEAH I SYSTEMS THAT ARE

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.393
CAREFULLY DESIGNED OVER A LITTLE

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.160
THOUGHT WAS GIVEN TO THE

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:32.628
ACCURACY OF THE TRAINING DATA

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:33.363
USED.

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:34.897
CAN RESULT IN OUTCOMES THAT ARE

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:36.399
UNFAIR OR BIASED.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.467
THIS CAN HAPPEN EVEN IF THE

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:38.334
DESIGNER DIDN'T HAVE MALICIOUS

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:40.036
INTENT.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:41.404
IN ORDER TO AVOID OUTCOMES LIKE

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.206
THIS TECHNOLOGISTS AND LAWMAKERS

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.974
NEED TO CAREFULLY THINK THROUGH

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:46.009
HOW THEY'RE DESIGNING AND

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.677
DEPLOYING NEW A AYE SYSTEMS AND

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:50.346
HOW THEY WILL BE PUT INTO.

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:51.814
DOCUMENTS LIKE THE ASILOMAR A

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:52.448
AYE PRINCIPLES CAN HELP IN THIS

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:53.716
REGARD.

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:54.417
THEY DON'T PROVIDE ALL THE

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.152
ANSWERS BUT THEY DO A VERY GOOD

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:58.154
JOB OF HELPING US FLAG THE SORTS

01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:58.688
OF ISSUES WE NEED TO THINK

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:00.189
THROUGH.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.424
MANY OF THEM MAY SEEM OBVIOUS

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.525
BUT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:03.526
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THESE

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.894
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.429
MISSED BY THOSE DEVELOPING AND

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.531
DEPLOYING A AYE SYSTEMS.

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:09.599
THESE PRINCIPLES REPRESENT A

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:11.334
STEP FORWARD IN THE RESPONSIBLE

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:12.702
DEVELOPMENT TODAY I AND WILL

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:13.870
HELP US ENSURE THAT A AYE

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:15.938
BENEFITS BENEFITS US ALL AS WE

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:18.141
ENTER THE SCIENCE FICTION FUTURE.

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:18.775
THANK YOU KNOW THE COURT YOUR

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:19.509
AYE VOTE.

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:24.147
OF THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:26.983
SEEN AN OPPOSITION.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.085
SEEING NONE LET'S BRING BACK TO

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:32.355
ONES ARE YOU FOR BRINGING THE

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:33.556
RESOLUTION FOR MY OFFICE IS

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:34.757
ACTUALLY BEEN LOOKING AT INTO

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.159
ISSUES REGARDING ARTIFICIAL

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:37.493
INTELLIGENCE --

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.896
YOU KNOW RECENTLY ALONG MOSQUE --

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:42.298
PAID FOR US OUR DOCUMENTARY TO

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.366
BE ONLINE FOR A LITTLE WHILE

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.234
IT'S CALLED THE TRUSSES COMPUTER

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:46.035
AND OF ANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN AT

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.136
AT OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.337
THAT IT TALKS ABOUT ARTIFICIAL

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:49.405
INTELLIGENCE IN THE DIFFERENCES

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:50.706
BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.442
IS PROGRAMMING CODE ARTIFICIAL

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:53.142
INTELLIGENCE.

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:56.512
YOU KNOW LIKE CERTAIN COMMANDS

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:57.613
AND THEN THERE'S A THOMAS.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.648
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS FREE

01:01:58.714 --> 01:01:59.749
THINKING I THINK THE CONCERN

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:01.684
THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:04.187
HAVE STE COMPANIES THAT ARE --

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:04.754
NOT REALLY STOPPING TO THINK

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:07.356
ABOUT IS OF WORKING ON

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.825
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE --

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.493
AND AT ANY POINT TIME COULD

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.395
RELEASE A COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:14.097
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT BEING

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:15.131
OVER THE NETWORK AND ONCE IT'S

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:16.566
OUT THERE THERE'S NO THERE'S NO

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:17.266
STOPPING IT.

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:18.935
THERE IS NO ON OFF BUTTONTO ANY

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.103
TYPE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:21.637
ONCE IT'S ONCE PERMEATED

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:22.538
THROUGHOUT OUR NETWORKING

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.440
THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM THERE'S NO

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:25.475
STOPPING IT OTHER THAN STE.

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:26.476
MAYBE SHUTTING DOWN THE ENTIRE

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:28.478
SYSTEM WHICH A IS NOT REALLY

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.146
FEASIBLE POWER NOT POSSIBLE LOT

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:31.347
OF PEOPLE WOULD BE HURT BY THAT

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.349
AND I I I I STILL QUESTION THE

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.150
THE REALITY BEING ABLE TO DO

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:35.151
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:36.853
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE I

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:37.420
THINK IS SOMETHING THAT THE

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.021
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING THAT

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.423
WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.524
IN THE WORLD WE ARE THE HOME TO

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:42.992
THE TECH INNOVATION SECTOR.

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.160
AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT US

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:45.728
WORLDWIDE TO SEE WHAT WE DO ON

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:46.863
THESE ISSUES IT'S REALLY

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.297
IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:49.432
TIME AND A LOT OF ENERGY

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:50.399
FOCUSING ON THIS BECAUSE WE

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:51.400
DON'T KNOW GOOGLE'S DOING BEHIND

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:52.235
THE SCENES RIGHT NOW OTHER

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:53.236
COMPANIES DO BEHIND THE SCENES

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:53.436
RIGHT.

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:54.704
NOW THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:55.838
UNLEASH AN ARTIFICIAL

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.406
INTELLIGENT BEING THROUGHOUT OUR

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:58.574
NETWORK AND ONCE IT'S OUT THERE

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:01.277
AGAIN WE HAVE NO ABILITY THERE'S

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:01.911
NO ON AND OFF SWITCH IT'S IT.

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:04.480
IT'S DONE AND SO I THINK YOU I'M

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:05.314
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT WITH

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.682
THE PRINCIPLES I APPRECIATE THE

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.784
RESOLUTIONS AND I CAN I CAN I GO

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.919
IN AND SPEND SOME MORE TIME

01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:10.953
LOOKING OUT THE PRINCIPLES

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:11.888
ACTUALLY DO BUT IT REALLY IS

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.122
IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT A LOT OF

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:13.322
TIME.

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:14.891
AND ENERGY OUT INTO THE SUBJECT

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:15.691
MATTER BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.226
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR LIVES

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.294
OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW AND KNOW

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:19.529
THE DIFFERENCE AND AGAIN.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.197
YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.565
BEEN USING THAT AS MORE COATED

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.500
TO GIVE A CERTAIN COMMAND --

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:25.902
LIKE.

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:27.370
I SEARCH FOR THESE THIS TYPE OF

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:28.738
INFORMATION ONLINE AND THEREFORE

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:30.206
I'M EXPOSED TO THAT TYPE OF

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:31.407
INFORMATION ONLINE I THINK

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.542
THAT'S ACTUALLY DETRIMENTAL.

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:35.111
I END AND I THINK PART OF WHY WE

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:37.146
ARE SEEING SUCH DIVERSE OF

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.514
POLITICAL --

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:39.715
SPEECH OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IS

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.851
BECAUSE WERE ONLY BEING FED WHAT

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.319
AN ALGORITHM BELIEVES WE SHOULD.

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.288
SEE OR WHAT THEY THINK WE WANT

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:46.789
TO SEE WHAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.157
SEE OPPOSING POSITIONS IN A BEEN

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.892
OPPOSING POINTS OF VIEW SO I

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:50.893
THINK THAT.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.695
IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE PLACE OF

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.830
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO GET

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:55.431
INVOLVED AT LEAST FOR OUR OWN

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:56.632
STATE.

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:58.568
BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER

01:03:58.634 --> 01:03:59.602
PEOPLE LOOKING AT US FOR

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.537
LEADERSHIP BUT ALSO TO TO REALLY

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:02.738
PUSH THE ENVELOPE TO ENCOURAGE

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:03.673
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:04.640
SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.242
OF REGULATION BECAUSE IS LACK OF

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:07.443
UNDERSTANDING IS A LACK OF

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.710
INTEREST.

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.612
AND IT'S KIND OF THIS --

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:10.246
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE A THING

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:13.049
OF THE MOVIES.

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.550
MORE IT IS A REALITY IT IS HERE.

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.385
AND WE NEED REAL REGULATION WHEN

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:17.887
MS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SO

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:18.888
I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:20.389
WHENEVER WE CAN OPPORTUNITY MOVE

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:21.691
AT ALL MOVE IT I WOULD

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:22.325
APPRECIATE YOU ARE BRINGING THE

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:23.960
MEASURE.

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:24.660
FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:26.329
MISTER OBERNOLTE.

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:28.431
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:29.665
WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:31.334
RESOLUTION I I HAD A COUPLE OF

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.468
CONCERNS THAT I JUST WANTED TO

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:35.171
VOICE BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS A

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:38.174
SET OF VALUES THAT WERE ADOPTED

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.542
OUT OF THE CONFERENCE AND WE ARE

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:40.610
POLICY BODY.

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:42.545
SO WE WORRY ABOUT HOW THOSE

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.847
VALUES TRANSLATE INTO POLICY AND

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.315
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT.

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:49.185
WAYS IN WHICH I THINK THAT SOME

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:50.519
OF THE VALUES EXPRESSED IN THIS

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:51.754
RESOLUTION.

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:53.356
NOW AND IN THE CAR OUTPUT OF THE

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:54.724
CONFERENCE ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:55.925
DIFFICULTY GETTING TRANSLATED

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:57.793
INTO POLICY AND I JUST WANTED TO

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:58.928
TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM.

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:00.896
BOB FIRST FAILURE TRANSPARENCY

01:05:00.963 --> 01:05:03.766
IT SAYS IF A NAY I SYSTEM CAUSES

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:04.634
HARM RICHARD PIPE POSSIBLE TO

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.668
ASCERTAIN Y. WHICH I TOTALLY

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:06.369
AGREE WITH.

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:08.104
AND THIS IS A REALLY DIFFICULT

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.238
THING TO DO WITH ARTIFICIAL

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:10.539
INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE BY

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:13.109
DEFINITION A AYE IS A NON I MEAN

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.377
IT IT'S IT'S WE DO IT WE

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:15.745
IMPLEMENTED DETERMINISTIC KLAY.

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:16.979
BUT THE OUTCOME OF OF THE NAY

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:18.481
AYE CALCULATION IS NOT

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:19.782
DETERMINISTIC SO.

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.117
I IF YOU DO SOMETHING WITH

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:23.119
MACHINE LEARNING THEIR IT'S IT'S

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.387
REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GO BACK AND

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:25.087
SAY WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:26.589
DECISION IT'S WELL CAN YOU TRAIN

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:27.490
ME ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT DATA

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.158
SETS AND I SUMMED UP ALL THESE

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:29.992
WEIGHTS ON THESE DIFFERENT

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.127
NEURONS AND THAT'S THE OUTPUT.

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:32.762
THAT I SELECTED AND YOU CAN'T

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:33.763
SAY WELL WHY DID YOU SAY THAT

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:36.132
YOU KNOW --

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.834
YOU DID HARM WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:40.303
TO RETRAIN IT RIGHT SO IT IT'S

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:42.004
THIS IS A CRITICALLY CRITICALLY

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:42.538
IMPORTANT.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.807
HOWEVER WE KNOW BY DEFINITION

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.542
BECAUSE WERE WERE LYING ON A AYE

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.344
TO MAKE THESE LEAPS --

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:50.179
OF OF LOGICAL THINKING ARE BY

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:51.881
DEFINITION WE'RE NEVER GOING TO

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:54.417
BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT EXACTLY --

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:55.251
ANOTHER ONE HAS RESPONSIBILITY

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:55.551
[inaudible]

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:58.254
THE CONFERENCE SAYS THAT

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:00.323
DESIGNERS AND BUILDERS OF A AYE

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:01.624
SYSTEMS ARE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:03.159
MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR USE

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:04.994
MISUSE AND ACTIONS WITH A

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:05.795
RESPONSIBILITY TO SHAPE THOSE

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:07.396
IMPLICATIONS.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:10.066
AND THAT IS GREAT AS A VALUE.

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.367
OUR I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.369
WERE THINKING ABOUT THE POLICY

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.104
IMPACT THOUGH THAT VALUE BECAUSE

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.939
IF YOU EQUATE RESPONSIBILITY

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.574
WITH LIABILITY.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:19.141
THEN IT COULD HAVE A VERY

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.876
CHILLING IMPACT ON THE

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:22.578
DEVELOPMENT AND THE DEPLOYMENT

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.580
OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:26.048
IMAGINE IF YOU.

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:28.050
OVER WORD A DEVELOPER OF ANY AYE

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:30.286
SYSTEM AND OUR LEGAL SYSTEM PUT

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.221
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERY SINGLE

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:33.422
MISTAKE THAT THAT PIECE OF A I

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:34.890
MADE AND ITS ENTIRE COMMERCIAL

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:36.258
LIFETIME ON YOU.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:37.927
YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT WOULD NOT

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:38.561
BE A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE THING

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:39.395
TO DO.

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:40.196
AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO

01:06:40.262 --> 01:06:41.797
TALK ABOUT WAS OTHER VALUES IN

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:43.933
HERE HUMAN VALUES IT SAYS A AYE

01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:45.067
SYSTEM SHOULD BE DESIGNED AND

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:45.935
OPERATED.

01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:47.169
SO AS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:48.738
IDEALS OF HUMAN DIGNITY RIGHTS

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:51.440
FREEDOMS AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY --

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:54.076
AS A POLICY MAKER I UNDERSTAND

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:54.710
WHAT THOSE ARE.

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.379
A IS A COMPUTER SCIENCE I HAVE

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:57.480
NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:59.415
ABOUT BECAUSE A I AM EVEN EVEN

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:01.117
THOUGH IT IS ANTHROPOGENIC IT IS

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.818
NOT ANTHROPOMORPHIC.

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:04.487
THEY AYE SYSTEMS LOOK AND THINK

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.822
NOTHING LIKE HUMANS DO AND TO

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.290
THE EXTENT THAT IT A AYE HOUSE

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:09.925
IN RESPECT VALUES.

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:12.027
IT'S ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.262
PROGRAM IT TO DO THAT.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:14.330
AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW YOU

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:15.631
WOULD TRANSLATE THAT INTO POLICY

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.032
ADMIN IF YOU'RE DESIGNING A SORT

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:19.034
OF A AYE. TO TO TRY AND FIGURE

01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:20.736
OUT WHAT LIFE EXPECTANCY IS FOR

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:22.171
LIFE INSURANCE ACTUARIAL TABLES

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:23.806
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:24.473
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER THE

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.075
QUESTION AS IT RESPECTING

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:26.709
CULTURAL DIVERSITY WHEN IT DOES

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:27.777
THAT?

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.211
SO I I JUST WANT TO CAUTION US

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.279
THAT IT'S IT'S GREAT TO ADOPT

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:31.747
THESE IDEALS BUT WE NEED TO BE

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:32.681
VERY VERY CAREFUL AS WE

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.383
TRANSLATE THEM INTO POLICY TO

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.751
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT IN

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:36.385
WAYS THAT ARE WORKABLE AND THAT

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:37.787
ARE USEFUL.

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:38.988
SO SORRY FOR THE MONARCH KNOW

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:40.256
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO YOU KNOW

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:41.757
IT'S COUNT ON A FELLOW EYE

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:43.492
CONTACT GRAD TO STIR THE POT OF

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.161
THE MINNESOTA.

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:46.629
THAT'S WHAT WE DO --

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:48.864
AYE I I I I I THINK THERE'S A

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:50.433
GREAT POINTS I AM I DON'T THINK

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:51.834
OUR INTENTION IS TO SAY THAT

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:52.635
EACH OF THESE PRINCIPLES

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.270
NECESSARILY HAS A A POLICY

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:55.871
QUARREL IT --

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:58.874
OR CONCRETE POLICY THAT I THINK --

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:00.943
MORE THE THINKING IS THAT --

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.811
I YOU KNOW IN THE COMING YEARS

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:03.779
ADVANCEMENTS AND I ARE GONNA --

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:05.347
YOU KNOW I TRANSFORM THE WAY WE

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:07.283
APPROACH PERHAPS EVERY POLICY

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:09.051
AREA AT THAT WE DEAL WITH THAT

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:10.352
AT THE CAPITOL HERE AND SO I

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:11.720
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT --

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:12.955
WE AT LEAST START TO KIND OF

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:14.256
THINK ABOUT THAT IN THESE

01:08:14.323 --> 01:08:16.392
PRINCIPLES I THINK PROVIDE US A

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:18.027
REALLY GOOD BASIS TECH KIND OF

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:19.595
GROUND THAT THOUGHT PROCESS AND

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.597
DISCUSSION IN THAT ARE OF YOU.

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:25.067
ANYONE THAT --

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:25.868
YEAH I WOULD JUST AGREE WITH

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.102
THAT IN THAT --

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:29.071
THESE PRINCIPLES AS ENVISIONED

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:29.672
BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:29.972
THE MORE.

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:30.973
I THINK DID NOT HAVE THE

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:31.974
INTENTION OF EACH ONE WOULD

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.709
TRANSLATE INTO A POLICY BUT SOME

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:34.577
OF THEM MIGHT TRANSLATE INTO

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:36.245
OTHER THINGS FOR EXAMPLE.

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:37.580
YOU BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF

01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:39.615
FAILURE TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAIN

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:41.150
ABILITY AND I SYSTEMS WHICH IS.

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:42.885
AS YOU MENTIONED TERRIBLE AT THE

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.553
MOMENT YOU SORT OF THERE'S NO

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.355
ANSWER TO WHY DID YOU DO THAT

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:47.323
OTHER THAN.

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:48.324
THOSE WITH IT THAT WAY TO MY

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.359
NARAL NETWORK SAID BUT THAT IS A

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.927
RESEARCH PROGRAM OF LOOKING FOR

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:53.596
HOW TO CREATE MACHINE LEARNING

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:54.830
SYSTEMS THAT DO HAVE SOME LEVEL

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:58.100
OF TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAIN

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:58.400
ABILITY SO.

01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:01.437
HAVING A CAN ENCOURAGE

01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:03.138
INVESTMENTS AND EFFORT PUT INTO

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:04.673
RESEARCH THAT ON THE TECHNICAL

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.208
SIDE BRING SOME OF THOSE

01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:07.610
CAPABILITIES INTO BEING AND THEN.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:08.844
IF THERE IS A TECHNICAL

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:10.279
CAPABILITY DO IT THEN YOU CAN

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.881
THINK OF IS THEIR POLICY THAT

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:13.382
THEY COULD ENCOURAGE THAT ARE

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:14.316
EVEN REQUIRED IN SOME

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:15.985
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SAY SAFETY

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:17.987
WAS VERY CRITICAL OR SOMETHING --

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:19.922
SO I THINK THE SOME OF THEM MAY

01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:21.123
TRANSLATE MORE LESS DIRECTLY IN

01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:22.625
A POLICIES BUT OTHERS ARE MORE

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:23.859
ASPIRATIONAL GOALS IT MIGHT

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.794
MIGHT ENCOURAGE RESEARCH OR

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:26.929
MIGHT ENCOURAGE --

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.231
A AYE RESEARCHERS THEMSELVES TO

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:29.832
THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THINGS

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.233
THAT WOULD IT'S IT'S COVERING

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.434
ALL THOSE DIFFERENT FACES I

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.103
WOULD SAY. FOR NOW I I REALIZE

01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:35.471
THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT.

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.540
THE INTENTION WAS NOT TO

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:39.675
TRANSLATE DIRECTLY INTO POLICY

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.410
HOWEVER I JUST WANTED TO CAUTION

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:43.178
EVERYONE BECAUSE WE ARE ADOPTING

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:44.780
AND SUPPORTING IT THAT WE NEED

01:09:44.847 --> 01:09:45.848
TO START THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.249
WILL GET TRANSLATE INTO POLICY.

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.218
BECAUSE IN FUTURE YEARS WE'RE

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:49.852
GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:52.121
ISSUE.

FACEBOOK THAT ARE BOTS SO

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:36.852
SIGNIFICANT QUESTION.

01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:38.587
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:40.155
IS TO BASICALLY TO TELL THE

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:42.024
TRUTH BILL.

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.658
TELL THE TRUTH BILL ARE YOU A

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:46.261
HUMAN ARE YOU A COMPUTER.

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:48.130
ARE YOU GENERATED FOR THAT

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:49.131
PURPOSE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:50.699
ABOUT.

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.100
NOW WHEN YOU DEAL IN THE ISSUE

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.568
OF TRUTH YOU RUN INTO THE FOLLOW

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:55.103
THE CONSTITUTION.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.705
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WHAT WE

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.240
SEEING WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO

01:17:58.306 --> 01:17:59.608
THE CREDIBLE STAFF YOU HAVE THIS

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:01.243
COMMITTEE THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN

01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:03.111
IN THE QUE TORTURED VIEW OF THE

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:04.346
CONSTITUTION.

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:05.647
FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAS SPENT HIS

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:08.116
ENTIRE LIFE IN THAT REGARD.

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:09.484
THE TRICK THAT'S OFTEN PLAYED ON

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.685
PEOPLE IS THAT YOU WRITE A

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:13.021
DOCUMENT YOU CITE CASES AND YOU

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.323
CITE CASES FOR PROPOSITIONS THAT

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:17.092
ARE BROUGHT PROPOSITIONS THAT

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:18.593
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE REALLY

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.261
IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:20.796
PRINCIPLES I WANT TO GIVE YOU A

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:21.530
FEW.

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:22.898
THAT WERE CITED BECAUSE I READ

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:26.334
THE CASES. FOR EXAMPLE IN TALLY

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:28.370
VERSUS CALIFORNIA THE CITY OF

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.772
LOS ANGELES PASSED AN ORDINANCE.

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.207
THAT SAID NO PERSON SHALL

DISTRIBUTE ANY HAND BILL WITHOUT

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.610
PUTTING THEIR NAME ON IT.

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:36.845
THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTS

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:40.415
PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO BE ANONYMOUS.

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:41.550
THE FEDERALIST PAPERS IS A

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:43.552
PERFECT EXAMPLE COMMONSENSE IN

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.153
THE CONSTITUTION THERE'S A

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.188
REASON WHY YOU WANT TO BE

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.823
ANONYMOUS.

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:50.292
BUT ANONYMITY ISN'T FRAUD.

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:52.160
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT IN

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.895
THE CONSTITUTION.

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:55.797
YOU CAN IS LAWS NOT YELLING FIRE

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:57.165
IN A CROWDED THEATER BUT YOU

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:59.568
COULD NOT COMMIT FRAUD WE HAVE

01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:01.103
IN THIS STE AND AND THAT'S WHAT

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:02.404
THIS BILLS ABOUT FRAUD BUSINESS

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:05.273
AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION.

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:05.907
SEVENTEEN FIVE HUNDRED WHICH IS

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:07.576
REFERENCED HERE TALKS ABOUT ACT

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:08.777
ACTIONS WHICH ARE UNTRUE WERE

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:10.245
MISLEADING.

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:11.780
THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS YOU TO

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:13.815
MAKE UP EXAGGERATE TWEET IF

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.016

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.718
UNITED STATES.

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:19.421
BUT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT THAT.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.889
THIS BILL ISN'T SAYS THAT I'M

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:22.891
THOMAS PAINE OR I'M ALEXANDER

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:25.060
HAMILTON THIS BILL SAYS THAT I'M

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:27.262
A COMPANY IN BULGARIA THAT'S

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:29.097
TRYING TO INCITE ACTIVITY.

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:30.565
AND ALL WE'RE SAYING IS IF

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:32.167
YOU'RE A BOT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:34.336
CREATE A PROCESS WHEREBY WE'RE

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:36.004
DEALING WITH THIS THING IN A

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:37.839
THOUGHTFUL INTELLIGENT MANNER.

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:38.807
THAT'S SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THIS

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.909
LEGISLATIVE BUILDING THAT I FIND

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:42.911
EXTRAORDINARILY FRUSTRATING.

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.012
THE INTEREST GROUPS THAT ARE

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.514
NARROW MINDED IN THEIR OWN

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.516
LITTLE WAYS TRY TO ENGAGE IN

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:48.884
BEHAVIOR BUT WE SEEN HERE IN

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:49.985
THIS BILL.

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:51.119
IS THE MERGER OF THE LEFT AND

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.821
THE RIGHT.

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.289
THE CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:55.557
BUSINESS AS USUAL AND DON'T

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.159
UPSET MY BUSINESS AND THE

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:58.827
CONSTITUTIONALIST TO TAKE A

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:00.762
TORTURED VIEW IN ADDITION I HAVE

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.697
ALL THE OTHER CASES THE MCINTYRE

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:03.165
CASE.

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:05.367
AND THE TURNER BROADCASTING CASE

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:06.868
AND THERE ARE A V. CASE WHICH

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:08.737
WAS A ST PAUL'S CASE THAT DEALT

01:20:08.803 --> 01:20:10.272
WITH INCENDIARY LANGUAGE IN

01:20:10.338 --> 01:20:11.706
SAINT PAUL WHICH IS NOT WHAT I'M

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.341
DEALING WITH IN THIS BILL.

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:14.876
THIS IS ABOUT TELLING THE TRUTH

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:16.912
AND USING THE COMPUTERS TO

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.346
MANIPULATE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:19.814
NOW BECAUSE OF THE POLITICS OF

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:20.815
THIS BILL THEY HAVE AGREED TO

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:22.817
TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:24.119
NOT HAPPY ABOUT BUT I WANT.

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:24.753

FORTY TWO FROM THE BILL WHICH IS.

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:31.993
GUTS IT PRETTY DRAMATICALLY BUT

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.995
I WILL BE BACK.

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:36.298
I AM PERSON OF GREAT --

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.500
RESILIENCE AND I WILL PUSH

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:39.834
THROUGH AND DEAL WITH WHAT I'VE

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:41.002
GOT TO DEAL WITH BUT I WANT TO

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:42.470
KEEP THE RECORD CLEAR AND

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:44.139
STRAIGHT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:45.140
HERE AND WHY.

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:47.075
AND THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN I

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:48.577
THINK THAT IS MORE AND MORE

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.212
PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THESE

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:51.780
IMPERSONATIONS THERE'S GOING TO

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:53.348
BE MORE EFFORT TO MOVE THE BALL

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:55.050
FORWARD IN WHAT HAPPENS IN

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:55.517
GOVERNMENT.

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.319
WHICH IS QUITE CHALLENGING FOR

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:59.588
ME IS THAT WE WE DON'T GET TO

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.523
THINK THROUGH THE FUTURE WE

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.458
RESPOND TO WHAT HAPPENS AND SO

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.327
THERE WILL BE MORE CONTROVERSIES

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:08.230

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:15.904
A BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT.

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:18.373
WE WILL HAVE IN MY VIEW MOVE THE

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.308
BALL BY BEGINNING TO IDENTIFY

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:21.810
THIS INSTEAD OF CUTTING AND

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:24.012
RUNNING AT LEAST GETTING IN THE

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.447

ELECTIONS ARE SELF ARE BEING

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:52.467
UNDERMINED IT IS WE WOULD

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.035
NORMALLY TURN TO WASHINGTON DC

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:55.170
TO FIX THAT BUT THERE IS NO

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:56.504
RATIONAL MIND IN THIS COUNTRY

AMERICANS WERE EXPOSED TO

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.134
RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA ON FACEBOOK

GAMES LIKE WORLD WARCRAFT LEAGUE

01:29:33.234 --> 01:29:34.102
OF LEGENDS.

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:35.837
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN YOU'RE

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:37.238

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.277
THE A I OF THE GAMEPLAY.

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:44.712
GIVEN THE POINT IS LIKE BUT I

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:45.913
GUESS THE QUESTION IS A CERTAIN

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.048
CHAIR IF I COULD.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:47.615
WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:48.916
THIS?

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.318
IF YOU'VE GOT SOME IDEAS TO MAKE

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:51.853
IT CLEAR I'M ALL FOR IT YOU KNOW

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:53.087
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT GAMES IN

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:54.322
MY THING IT WOULD LOVE TO GET

01:29:54.388 --> 01:29:55.823
YOUR INSIGHTS ON THAT HAPPY TO

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:57.325
MAKE CHANGES IN THAT REGARD.

01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:59.694
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:01.329
TO MAKE SURE.

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:02.997
IN THESE CONTEXTS WHAT HAVE WE

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:04.665
SEEN WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EVEN

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:07.001
HIM EVEN THE MAJORITY LEADER

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:08.436
YOUNG GUY RIGHT.

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:10.938
THE GUY SIT NEXT TO HIM THESE

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:11.606
GUYS IN HAVE BOTS WHEN THEY WERE

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:12.507
KIDS DID YOU.

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:13.574
IT WAS A DIFFERENT WE HAD VIDEO

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:15.543
GAMES AND STUFF BUDGET THAT BOTS

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:16.911
TODAY IT'S ALL BECOME A REALLY

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:17.945
BIG THING.

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.046
AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET TO

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:20.748
IT BY VIRTUE OF THE IMPACT IT'S

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.083
HAVING ON BUSINESS SONS IT'S

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:24.485
HAVING ON POLITICAL DISCOURSE.

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:26.988
AND TRYING TO BASICALLY LABEL IT

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:28.289
SO THAT BECAUSE THE YOUR

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:30.124
INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO DECEIVE

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:31.359
THAT'S THE POINT.

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:32.593
AND IT TALKS ABOUT INTENTIONAL

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.195
DECEPTION WE'RE AND FURIOUS

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:35.696
AGREEMENT OKAY WELL ALL WORK

LET'S MENTAL TIME A BY A LUNCH

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:39.600
AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN COME AYE

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:40.401
SOME FURTHER CLARIFIED.

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:41.903
BUT I MEAN IF MY POINT IS IF WE

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:43.571
RELY ON COMMON SENSE TO

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:45.640
INTERPRET THE LAW THEN A LOT OF

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:49.010
THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:50.278
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER.

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:50.945
WE HAVE TO GO ON IS IS WHAT IS

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:52.213
IN THE LAW AND THE WAY THAT

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.981
YOU'VE WRITTEN THIS MAKES IT

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:55.349
BROAD ENOUGH THAT.

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:57.451
A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:58.686
HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION COULD

01:30:58.753 --> 01:31:00.488
BE IMPACTED AND I JUST RAISE ONE

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:01.789
HAVE BEEN WE JUST OF VIDEO GAMES

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:03.291
BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT --

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:05.593
VIRTUAL REALITY AND AUGMENT

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:06.794
FIELDS WHERE --

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:08.029
IS REALLY GOING TO BLUR THE

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:09.831
LINES BETWEEN --

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:11.065
INTERACTING WITH REAL PEOPLE

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:12.366
INTERACTING WITH MACHINE SO YOU

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:14.869
READ THE PREFACE WHEN VERY SURE

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:17.138
THAT WE THAT WE TIGHTEN DOWN.

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:17.939
OKAY YOU KNOW THE LOOK AT IT

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:20.341
WILL MEAN BY FIVE MISLEAD NO.

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:21.576
I JUST ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS IT

01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:23.144
IS COMMON SENSE WHEN YOU READ

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:24.412
THE PREFACE TO OLIVER WENDELL

01:31:24.478 --> 01:31:25.746
HOLMES THE COMMON LAW IN THE

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.515
FIRST PARAGRAPH IT SAYS THE LIFE

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:28.583
OF THE LAW.

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:29.884
HAS NOT BEEN LOGIC IT'S BEEN

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.586
EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING THAT WE DO

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:33.120
HERE EVERY LAW THAT WE WRITE

01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:35.489
EVERY JUDGE'S INTERPRETATION IS

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:36.524
BASED ON EXPERIENCE.

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.559
IT IS ULTIMATELY REGULATION OF

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.528
THE HUMAN CONDITION AND SO THAT

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:42.597
IS IT IS ULTIMATELY COMMON SENSE

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:44.765
AND HAVE ALWAYS HAS TO BE EVERY

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:46.334
TIME WE WRITE A LAW.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.335
THAT'S MY VIEW.

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:48.436
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF I COULD JUST

01:31:48.502 --> 01:31:49.704
POINT OUT THERE IS A CARVE OUT

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:50.905
IN THE BILL THAT THIS ONLY

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:53.074
APPLIES TO CASES OF COMMERCIAL

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.109
SALE OF PRODUCTS OR TO INFLUENCE

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.310
THE VOTE IN AN ELECTION THAT

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:57.411
SOUNDS TO ME MORE LIKE AN

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:58.546
ENTERTAINMENT I SEE HOW YOU

01:31:58.613 --> 01:31:58.779
COULD.

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:00.514
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:02.683
COMMERCIAL SALE --

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:03.618
WASN'T I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:05.052
LANGUAGE ABOUT ELECTIONS I MEAN

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.554
COMMERCIAL MEANT THAT THIS IS

01:32:06.621 --> 01:32:08.222
WHAT WE DO IS COMMERCIAL RIGHT

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:08.823
ON TOP TALK ABOUT A COMMERCIAL
