THIS IS NOT A NEW THING FOR THEM

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:31.303
RIGHT ON THE MEDICINAL SIDE THEY

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.205
HAVE ALSO HAD THIS

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:33.805
RESPONSIBILITY IN THE PAST IS

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:34.540
THAT RIGHT.

RIGHT SO IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S OF

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.254
A POINT OF BAFFLEMENT FOR FOR ME

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:51.356
AT LEAST IS THAT THIS IS NOT

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:51.924
SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENED

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.325

WE HAVE NOT HAD A CLEAR

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:18.850

I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:40.339
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS WE ARE

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.641
LEFT WITH NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE --

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:45.177
IF WE DO NOT PASS THIS BILL --

00:20:45.243 --> 00:20:47.145
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOUSANDS OF

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:49.281
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE TRYING TO

IN FACT THAT WE'RE TAKING TEN

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:56.421
BUT THERE ARE EW THAT I WOULD

00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:57.722
LIKE TO BE ABLE.

00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:59.958
TO THROW OUT NUMBER ONE WE HAVE

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:01.393
TO GET THIS BILL PASSED SO WE

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:02.928
DON'T HAVE FOLKS WHO WERE LEGAL

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:04.496
NOW ENDING UP INTO THE ILLICIT

00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:05.664
MARKET.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.832
THAT THEN BY THIS TIME TO HAVE A

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:09.701
GREATER CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:11.069
SENATE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:13.071
ADMINISTRATION.

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:14.105
I WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:16.141
CONVERSATIONS WOULD THEN BE ABLE

00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:18.777
TO ADVANCE A LONG TRM FIX.

00:26:18.843 --> 00:26:20.779
ON THE BACKLOG AND HOW WE GET

00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:22.681
THESE FOLKS INTO THE ANNUAL

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:24.316
CATEGORY.

00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:26.785
MY FINAL ITEM ON THIS --

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:27.786
IS.

00:26:27.852 --> 00:26:29.421
IT'S IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME

00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:30.989
THERE'S AN ENORMOUS.

00:26:31.056 --> 00:26:34.326
AMOUNT OF DEMAND DOUBLY

00:26:34.392 --> 00:26:36.828
COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE TO BE

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:37.662
ABLE TO GET THROUGH.

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:41.633
AND I RIGHT NOW TIME IS NOT ON

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.134
OUR SIDE WE HAVE TO GET TO SING

00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:44.869
MOVED WHAT I'M WONDERING IS IF

00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:47.439
THE PROCESS IS EXTREMELY

00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:49.207
CUMBERSOME AND IF THAT'S A PART

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.208
OF WHY.

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.443
THE DELAY CERTAINLY I'M SURE

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:52.877
RESOURCES IS PART OF IT

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:55.447
BUDGETARY RESOURCES BUT IF IF

00:26:55.513 --> 00:26:56.848
FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE FROM THE

00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:58.750
DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO GO OUT

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:00.352
TO TRAVEL OUT TO THE FACILITY.

00:27:00.418 --> 00:27:02.387
AND LOOK AT THINGS AN EXAM AND I

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:03.922
WOULD SEE WHERE THAT WOULD

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:05.323
CREATE A TREMENDOUS BACKLOG AND

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.491
SO I'M WONDERING IF.

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:08.626
IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY WITHIN

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:12.263
THEIR REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.132
STREAMLINE AND AND SPEED UP THE

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:17.102
PROCESS SOMEHOW OR IF THAT WAS

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:19.671
HARD LINE IN THE BALLOT MEASURE

00:27:19.738 --> 00:27:20.972
ITSELF AND DESCRIPTIVE IN THE

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.107
BALLOT MEASURE.

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:24.409
PERHAPS IT WAS TOO PRESCRIPTIVE

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.745
AND BUT ON THE OTHER HAND MAYBE

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:27.412
IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:29.948
CHANGED THROUGH THEIR REGULATORY

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:32.550
ABILITY.

00:27:32.617 --> 00:27:34.085
I'LL BE THE THE FIRST TO SAY AND

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:34.886
I THINK THAT --

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:36.321
ARE TWO WITNESSES TODAY WILL BE

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:38.590
THE RIGHT THERE WITH ME THAT-THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY

00:27:38.656 --> 00:27:39.657
CHALLENGING PROCESS TO GET

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:42.227
THROUGH AND IF YOU ARE A FARMER.

00:27:42.293 --> 00:27:44.295
WHO HAD BEEN FARMING ON THE LAND

00:27:44.362 --> 00:27:45.530
FOR THIRTY YEARS FOR YOUR SECOND

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:46.564
GENERATION YOU'RE TRYING TO BE

00:27:46.631 --> 00:27:47.899
ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:49.834
BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS OF BOTH THE

00:27:49.901 --> 00:27:51.403
COUNTY IN THE STATE?

00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:52.971
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME SO --

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:56.274
WHAT I'LL SAY IS THIS FIRST WE

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:58.410
ONLY ENGAGE WE BEING THE STATE

00:27:58.476 --> 00:28:00.378
ONCE WE GET THE NOD FROM LOCAL

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:02.547
GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTHAS

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:04.049
FOR SAY ON THE LICENSES?

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:06.051
THEY THEN ENTER INTO THE STATE

00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:08.086
PROCESS -- I

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:10.221
DO I DON'T EVER WANT TO SPEAK

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:11.189
FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:13.324
LOOKING THOUGH AT SIXTY NINE

00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:15.593
HUNDRED LICENSES AS WELL AS THE

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.263
NUMBER OF STAFF THAT THEY HAVE --

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:19.397
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME

00:28:19.464 --> 00:28:21.599
CHALLENGES I AGAIN THAT'S JUST

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:23.568
ME SPEAKING MY OWN EDITORIAL ON

00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:25.403

NEED IN IN IN THIS IS A AN ITEM

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:29.340
THAT DAY CHAIR BROUGHT UP.

00:28:29.407 --> 00:28:32.444

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:49.894

TERM SOLUTION IF THE

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:53.237

ISSUE.

00:32:57.308 --> 00:32:59.744
ARE THE ONLY WAY TO BE MY

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:00.445
OPINION --

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:02.914
IN WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TRY TO

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.148
LOOK AT ADMINISTRATIVE FIXES I

00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:06.451
AM NOT A BIG BELIEVER THAT WE

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:07.352
SHOULD HAVE TO BRING FOR THE

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:09.354
BILL. TO GET A FIX ON AN ISSUE

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.289
FACT THAT SHOULD BE THE LAST

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:12.223
RESORT.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.224
BEING VERY HONEST WITH THE CHAIR

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:15.126
IN THIS COMMITTEE.

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:15.760
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:18.896
AT WE NEED THE ADMINISTRATION TO

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:21.599
ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE. TO DEVELOP

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:24.268
A LONG TERM FIX COLLABORATIVELY

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:26.637
WITH THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY --

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:29.073
SO NEXT STEPS WILL BE.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.743
CONTINUING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:32.810
BETWEEN THE WORKING GROUP'S OF

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:35.146
BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY.

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:37.882
AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:39.083
ADMINISTRATION I DO KNOW THAT

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.886
THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS WITH --

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:43.521
CD AT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:45.156
FOOD NAG --

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:47.158
BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:49.026
BEEN ABLE.

00:33:49.093 --> 00:33:50.328
TO HERE ANY SOLUTIONS WHICH IS

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:52.897
WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY I'M HAVING

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:56.300
TO TAKE IN OUR OWN HANDS.

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:57.702
BUT I PROMISE YOU CENTER TO LET

00:33:57.769 --> 00:34:00.037
A IT'S ABOUT MS OF MOST

00:34:00.104 --> 00:34:02.774
IMPORTANCE.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.509
CENTER GALGIANI UP DOES ANYBODY

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:06.043
KNOW WHETHER THE COUNTY LEVEL

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.578
PROCESS IS THE SAME COUNTY BY

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:10.415
COUNTY OR IS IT THAT CDFA HAS TO

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:12.583
DEAL WITH FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.520
LOCAL PROCESSES AND SO FORTH

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:18.022
WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO THEN.

00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:20.691
THERE I BELIEVE IT'S IN STATUTE --

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:23.227
COUNTIES HAVE SIXTY DAYS OF

00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:24.595
DIFFERENT ORDINANCES SO THE

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:26.230
PROCESS FOR THE FOR THE

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:28.199
APPLICANT BASED ON EACH COUNTY

00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:29.734
IS DIFFERENT BUT THE COUNTY DOES

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:32.136
NEED TO REPLY TO THE STATE WHEN

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.738
ASKED WITHIN SIXTY DAYS CORRECT.

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.473
BECAUSE I COULD SEE WHERE IF IF

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.308
I'M A STAFF MEMBER AT CDFA AND

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:38.176
I'M LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.777
LICENSE APPLICATIONS AND

00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:41.045
EVERYTHING COMING MY WAY IS

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:42.013
DIFFERENT ALL THE FORMS ARE

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:43.548
DIFFERENT I HAVE TO LOOK IN

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:44.816
DIFFERENT PLACES TO FIND.

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:46.317
THE INFORMATION I COULD SEE

00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:48.653
WHERE THAT WOULD SLOW THINGS UP

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.354
SOME JUST WONDERING IF THAT'S A

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.056
PART OF THE PROBLEM.

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:53.624
I THINK THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:55.893
CHALLENGES BUT I I MY BOTTOM

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.028
LINE AND CONTINUE TO COME BACK

00:34:57.094 --> 00:34:59.430
TO IS WE'VE KNOWN THIS WAS GOING.

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:00.731
TO HIT US.

00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:03.534
IN HIT US HARD ON IN THAT IS

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:04.669
WHERE.

00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:06.137
I HAVE SOME FRUSTRATION I DON'T

00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:07.672
SPEAK FOR THE CHAIR I BELIEVE HE

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:09.407
HAS SOME FRUSTRATION --

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.242
IN IT IS HUMAN NATURE.

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:12.777
ANYTIME.

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.412
ODD THAT I I KNOW I'M LIKE THIS

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:15.613
IF IT'S GOING TO COST ME A LOT

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.148
OF MONEY AND IT'S GONNA BE

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:18.282
COMPLICATED I'M GONNA WAIT TO

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:20.017
THE LAST MINUTE.

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:21.986
WE SAW AB.

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:26.023
SHOOT YOU RUSH. TO SECURE A

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:30.628
TEMPORARY LICENSE OF TO TEAM SO

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:34.232
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE --

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:36.300
CDFA SIDE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:35:36.367 --> 00:35:38.135
APPLICATIONS COMING IN THOSE

00:35:38.202 --> 00:35:42.807
LAST NINETY DAYS OF TWO THOUSAND

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:44.141
EIGHTEEN AND IF IT'S AN ISSUE

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:45.276
THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:46.511
EXPAND BAND WITH.

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:47.545

BUDGET SUB TWO WE LOOK FOR TO

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:51.415
WORKING WITH THEM TO BE ABLE TO

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:53.985
DRIVE DOWN THE SIXTY NINE

00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:56.187
HUNDRED NUMBER.

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:57.021
SENATOR MCGUIRE WELL IT'S FAIR

00:35:57.088 --> 00:35:57.989
TO SAY THAT THERE WERE  LOT

00:35:58.055 --> 00:35:58.923
LAST MINUTE APPLICATIONS IS IT

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.057
ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE WERE

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:01.259
HUNDREDS IF NOT.

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:02.760
THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS IN THE

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:05.329
EARLY PART OF THE YEAR.

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:07.498
YES OKAY THAT IS OF AN AND YOUR

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:09.066
SUMMARY IS THAT THAT CDFA IS

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:12.870
PROVIDED [inaudible] FOR FOR

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.171
CALL CULTIVATION Là ANNUAL

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:15.840
LICENSES IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME

00:36:15.907 --> 00:36:17.008
FOR THEIR WEBSITE OKAY BECAUSE

00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:17.875
I'M SENSITIVE TO A NEW

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:19.277
ADMINISTRATION.

00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:20.745
AND THEY GET THE CHANCE TO GET

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:21.345
THEIR FEET ON THE GROUND FOR

00:36:21.412 --> 00:36:22.179
SURE.

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:24.448
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY EXPLAIN --

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.817
IS A LOT MORE TO THE TO WHAT'S

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:28.619
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING --

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:30.521
CERTAINLY THE SENSITIVITY --

00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:31.822
TO THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY ISSUE

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:33.524
IS GOOD BUT THE AT THAT WOULD BE

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:35.860
WHY WE SHOULD HAVE CDFA HERE.

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:37.161
GIVING US AN EXPLANATION AND I

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:40.464

CERTAINLY TO ME.

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:43.100

EXPLANATION FOR WHY WERE IN THIS

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:45.937
CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:47.471
BUT NOT JUST UNDERSTAND IT BUT

00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:48.573
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:50.274
TRYING TO DO IS HELPFUL.

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.676
IN DOING WHAT WE HAVE MUTUAL

00:36:51.742 --> 00:36:53.244
GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH AND WE'RE

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:54.979
NOT EVEN CLEAR ON THAT ALTHOUGH

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:56.614
I THINK THIS LEGISLATION.

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:58.783
IS A NECESSARY STEP TO TAKE A

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:00.251
