THE AUDIT REPORT WE LOOK AT

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.987
LICENSING- WE CERTAINLY LOOKED

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.689
AT. THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC

00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:58.423
HEALTH AND THEIR INSPECTION

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.725
PRACTICES THEIR ABILITY TO

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:02.394
ISSUE CITATIONS TIMELY AND

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.762
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CITATIONS

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:05.830
ARE EFFECTIVE IN GETTING

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.933
QUALITY OF CARE IMPROVED A

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:09.401
LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION ON

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:11.436
AND THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:12.470
THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEN

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:14.439
CERTAINLY RELATED PARTIES SO

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:15.907
STARTING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF

00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:17.976
BACKGROUND AS I'M SURE YOU ARE

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:19.311
AWARE MEMBERS BACK WHEN WE

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:21.112
CONDUCTED THE AUDIT. WE LOOKED

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:23.281
AT A TIME FRAME OF TWO THOUSAND

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:24.382
SIX THROUGH TWO THOUSAND

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:25.784
FIFTEEN ABOUT A TEN YEAR WINDOW

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.585
AND FOUND THAT DEFICIENCY SUB

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:28.586
STANDARD CARE HAD BEEN

00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:30.555
INCREASING AND HAD INCREASED

00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:32.057
PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT

00:26:32.123 --> 00:26:33.892
THIRTY ONE PERCENT- BUT THEN

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:36.127
ALSO SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S

00:26:36.194 --> 00:26:37.295
IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY WHERE IT

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:39.097
WOULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM OR

00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:40.899
POTENTIALLY DEATH HAD ACTUALLY

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:43.001
INCREASED THIRTY FIVE PERCENT.

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:44.936
SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT WHETHER

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:45.904
PUBLIC HEALTH WAS ISSUING

00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:48.673
CITATIONS WE SAW THE OPPOSITE

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.975
WE SAW THAT SIDE THE NUMBER OF

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.209
CITATIONS HAD ACTUALLY

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:53.979
DECLINED- SO WE WANTED TO SEE

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:54.980
YEARS IT BECAUSE THERE'S A

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.281
DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:58.283
BEDS HAS THE INDUSTRY CHANGED

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.184
THERE WASN'T A SIGNIFICANT

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.653
CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY AS FAR

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.154
AS THE NUMBER OF NURSING BEDS

00:27:03.221 --> 00:27:05.090
AVAILABLE INDUSTRY WIDE SO

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.624
THERE CLEARLY WAS A PROBLEM

00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:07.759
WITH QUALITY OF CARE AND

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:09.294
CERTAINLY AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:12.263
WOOD AND CENTER MCGUIRE. CITED

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.065
IN THEIR REQUEST LETTER. SO THE

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:15.967
FIRST AREA THAT WE LOOKED AT IS

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:17.235
RELATED TO LICENSING AND THAT'S

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:18.870
THE FIRST SECTION WE HAVE AND

00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:21.039
HAND OUT FOR YOU AND WHAT WE

00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:21.873
LOOK AT WE LOOK AT THREE

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.875
DIFFERENT NURSING HOME FACILITY

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:25.677
OWNERS OF PREVIOUS PLOMIN LONG

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:27.545
WORD LONG WORD AND WANTED TO

00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:29.247
SEE HOW CONSISTENT DEPARTMENT

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:31.750
OF PUBLIC HEALTH WAS IN

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:33.418
REVIEWING APPLICATIONS FOR

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:35.353
LICENSURE- AND MAKING

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.654
DETERMINATIONS AND WHAT WE

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:38.356
FOUND IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.892
INCONSISTENCIES- WE'VE WE

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:42.794
LOOKED AT TEN FILES WE FOUND

00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:44.729
THAT NINE FILES WERE INCOMPLETE

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:46.064
SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:47.032
THOSE FILES IS PUBLIC HEALTH IS

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:48.900
SAYING. WE LOOK TO SEE HOW MANY

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:50.635
CITATIONS A PARTICULAR FACILITY

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:52.737
HAD- LOOK TO SEE IF THERE ARE

00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:53.838
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:55.874
DEFICIENCIES AND WE FACT USE

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.909
CELLS AS FACTORS TO DETERMINE

00:27:57.976 --> 00:28:00.011
WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE A

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:01.713
LICENSE APPLICATION BUT

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.181
UNFORTUNATELY WE LOOKED AT TEN

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:04.749
FILES WE FOUND NINE THAT WERE

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:06.484
INCOMPLETE THEY WERE NOT FULLY

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:08.686
DOCUMENTING THE DEFICIENCIES

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:10.622
ANY CITATIONS ANY COMPLAINTS

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:14.793
THAT HAD BEEN RECEIVED- SO WHEN-WE LOOKED AT A DISTINCTION

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.861
BETWEEN APPROVING A LICENSE

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:19.130
APPLICATION FROM PLUM VERSUS

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:21.166
ONE FROM LONG WATER FROM YES WE

00:28:21.232 --> 00:28:22.534
SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE SIMILAR

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.835
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT DIFFERENT

00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:25.804
DECISIONS. SO WE REALLY HAD

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.605
SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:29.741
THAT INCONSISTENCY AND WHETHER

00:28:29.808 --> 00:28:31.876
OR NOT PUBLIC HEALTH REALLY HAD

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:34.446
A GOOD DEFENDABLE PROCESS- IN

00:28:34.512 --> 00:28:35.947
ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE LOOKING

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:37.549
TO SEE WHAT ARE THE FACTORS ARE

00:28:37.615 --> 00:28:39.017
WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE ARE

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:41.186
PUBLIC HEALTH- EMPLOYEES

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:42.687
RECEIVING TO DETERMINE DO I

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:43.988
NEED TO ELEVATE THIS TO A

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:45.390
HIGHER LEVEL TO A HIGHER LEVEL

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:46.324
MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:49.761
DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SOME

00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:50.762
DECISIONS RELATED TO LICENSURE.

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:51.863
AND AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE ON

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.165
THE HAND OUT WE HAVE JUST

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:56.201
DECISIONS WERE INCONSISTENT.

00:28:56.267 --> 00:28:57.268
BECAUSE PUBLIC HEALTH HAD A

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:58.803
POOR PROCESS THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.072
ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION. SO WE

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:02.040
MADE A COUPLE OF

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:03.475
RECOMMENDATIONS HERE WANT TO

00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:05.743
THE LEGISLATURE. TO REQUIRE

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:06.811
PUBLIC HEALTH TO OUTLINE THOSE

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.880
FACTORS AND THAT THEY WILL

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:09.781
CONSIDER WHEN APPROVING OR

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:11.616
DENYING APPLICATIONS SO THERE'S

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:14.185
SOME CONSISTENCY. THE PROPOSAL

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:15.587
NEEDS OUTLINED SPECIFIC

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:17.755
CRITERIA THAT PUBLIC HEALTH

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:20.291
STAFF WOULD USE TO MAKE THOSE

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:21.793
DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.862
TO APPROVE OR DENY. AND WHAT WE

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:24.996
ARE SUGGESTING IS A LEGISLATURE

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:27.732
CODIFY. ESTABLISH A STATUTE

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:29.367
THAT KIND OF LAYS OUT WHAT

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:30.668
PUBLIC HEALTH PUT TOGETHER AS

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:31.836
FAR AS WHAT THE FACTOR SHOULD

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:34.038
BE. AND WHAT TYPES OF

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:34.839
CONSIDERATIONS PUBLIC HEALTH

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:37.642
SHOULD. SHOULD BE ADDRESSING.

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:38.843
AS YOU CAN SEE IN OUR DOCUMENT

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.745
WE LOOKED AT AB FIFTY NO TO

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:42.313
THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TUCCI HAS

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.715
AUTHORED AND I'M IT'S M

00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:46.184
UNDERSTANDING IT IS- A TWO YEAR

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:47.785
BUILT- BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:50.255
THAT LEGISLATION THAT BILL. WE

00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:51.990
BELIEVE THAT MUCH OF THE BILL

00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:53.625
ADDRESSES THE RECOMMENDATION

00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:55.894
THAT WE HAD AND IT WILL CODIFY

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.128
SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT PUBLIC

00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:58.997
HEALTH SHOULD BE CONSIDERING.

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:00.632
WHEN THEY'RE ASSESSING AND WHEN

00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:02.367
THEY'RE ESTABLISHING WHAT WE

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:04.202
HOPE TO SEE AS A CONSISTENT

00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:06.838
STRONG ROBUST LICENSING REVIEW

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:08.306
PROCESS SO WE THINK THAT.

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:09.974
LEGISLATION GOES A LONG WAY IN

00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:11.142
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:14.445
WE IDENTIFIED. IN THE AUDIT A

00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:15.413
FEW YEARS AGO. IN ADDITION TO

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.781
THAT WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:18.383
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:19.450
THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR

00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:21.553
LICENSING REVIEW PROCESS AND WE

00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:23.588
LAID OUT HERE AND BULLETS.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:24.222
ENSURING THAT THE ANALYST

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:26.758
COMPLETE. STANDARDIZED REVIEW

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:27.725
OF APPLICATIONS MAKE SURE

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:28.593
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ALL THE

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.195
CITATIONS THE CAUGHT THAT THE

00:30:30.261 --> 00:30:31.863
DEFICIENCIES AT CETERA.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.665
DETERMINE WHAT FACTORS WILL BE

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:36.034
INCLUDED. IN THEIR ANALYSIS AND

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.335
HOW DO THEY WAIT THOSE FACTORS

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:38.836
WHICH FACTORS ARE PERHAPS MORE

00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:41.105
IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS WE REALLY

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:41.673
DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THAT WE

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:43.441
CONDUCTED THE AUDIT. AND THEN

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:45.210
DEVELOPING THAT THRESHOLD IS

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:46.544
THERE A THRESHOLD WHERE I HAVE

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:47.278
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:48.379
DEFICIENCIES A CERTAIN NUMBER

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:50.014
OF CITATIONS. THAT I AS AN

00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:51.216
ANALYST AT PUBLIC HEALTH NEED

00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:52.850
TO ELEVATE THIS TO HIGHER LEVEL

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:55.420
MANAGEMENT. SO THAT- THERE'S

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:57.855
CONSISTENT AGAIN PROCESS AND

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:59.591
DECISION MAKING. AND THEN

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:00.858
ADEQUATELY DOCUMENT THOSE

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:02.827
DECISIONS AS WELL AS I SAID IN

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:03.962
NINE OF THE TEN APPLICATIONS WE

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:05.830
LOOKED AT. WE SAW INCOMPLETE

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.765
APPLICATIONS POOR DOCUMENTATION

00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:09.033
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR PUBLIC

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.768
HEALTH TO EXPLAIN TO US BASED

00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:12.503
ON THE MATERIALS IN THE FILES.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:13.638
WHY DID YOU APPROVE THIS

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:15.240
APPLICATION AND WHITED VERSES

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:17.375
DENYING THIS OTHER ONE SO THERE

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:19.210
NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENCY. AS YOU

00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:20.712
CAN SEE AND THE AND THE HANDOUT

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:21.412
WE'RE SAYING PARTIALLY

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:23.281
IMPLEMENTED. SO PUBLIC HEALTH

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:25.617
HAS IMPLEMENTED SOME PROCESSES

00:31:25.683 --> 00:31:26.451
TO STANDARDIZE LICENSING

00:31:26.517 --> 00:31:28.486
REVIEW. THEY'VE CREATED SOME OF

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:30.221
THOSE THRESHOLDS THAT WOULD

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:32.957
PROMPT. ANALYSTS TO ELEVATE.

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:35.026
THE FIRST. LINE THEIR PUBLIC

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:36.327
HEALTH HAS NOT DETERMINED HOW

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:37.028
ANALYSTS WILL WEIGH THE

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:39.430
FACTORS- AS RECENTLY AS THIS

00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:41.799
PAST THURSDAY OR FRIDAY EVENING

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:42.800
WE RECEIVE SOME MATERIALS FROM

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:44.769
PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT THEY ARE

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.037
HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION WE

00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:47.438
HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO FULLY

00:31:47.505 --> 00:31:49.040
REVIEW THOSE TO DETERMINE

00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:49.841
WHETHER OR NOT IT FULLY

00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:51.809
ADDRESSES. OUR CONCERNS BUT

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:53.077
THAT'S KIND OF LATE BREAKING

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.012
NEWS I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:55.780
I. I SHARE THAT WITH YOU TODAY

00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:57.482
BUT AT THIS POINT UNTIL WE HAVE

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.083
A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THAT. WE

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.084
BELIEVE THIS IS PARTIALLY

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:01.719
IMPLEMENTED THEY NEED TO DO

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:04.289
SOME ADDITIONAL WORK. SO THAT

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:05.990
WAS THE FIRST AREA OF THE AUDIT

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:07.158
REPORT THAT WE LOOKED AT AS FAR

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:08.326
AS LICENSING AND THE

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:09.827
CONSISTENCY AND WHAT FACTORS

00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:11.429
ARE USING ARE YOU TRAINING YOUR

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:14.399
ALICE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:14.966
THE SECOND AREA WANT TO TALK

00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:15.867
ABOUT STATE RELICENSING

00:32:15.933 --> 00:32:17.869
INSPECTIONS. AND THESE ARE VERY

00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:18.870
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.071
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE STATE LAW

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:21.205
REQUIRES THE INSPECTORS

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.507
INSPECTIONS TO BE DONE EVERY

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:24.275
TWO YEARS. AND IT'S TO ENSURE

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:26.277
THAT FACILITIES ARE. YOU KNOW

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:28.413
COMPLYING WITH STATE LAW. AND

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:29.947
MEETING THE QUALITY OF STANDARD

00:32:30.014 --> 00:32:31.416
REQUIREMENTS THAT A NURSING

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:33.451
FACILITY SHOULD MEET. WHEN WE

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:35.620
CONDUCTED THE AUDIT AGAIN WE

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:36.621
ISSUED THIS REPORT BACK IN

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:38.323
TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WHAT WE FOUND

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:39.590
IS PUBLIC HEALTH WAS

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:41.826
PRIORITIZING THEIR FEDERAL.

00:32:41.893 --> 00:32:43.194
RELICENSING INSPECTIONS ARE

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:44.896
THERE FEDERAL INSPECTIONS AS

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:45.563
OPPOSED TO THE STATE

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.098
INSPECTIONS PART OF THE PROBLEM

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:49.367
HERE IS. AS WE CITED IN THE

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:51.102
REPORT THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:52.737
IS EVERY FIFTEEN MONTHS A

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.706
FACILITY HAS TO BE REVIEWED.

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:56.574
THE STATE LAW REQUIRES A STATE

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:58.176
INSPECTION AS I SAID EVERY TWO

00:32:58.242 --> 00:32:59.444
YEARS SO IT'S TWENTY FOUR

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.311
MONTHS IT WAS A DIFFERENT

00:33:00.378 --> 00:33:03.481
CYCLE. SO WHAT WE SUGGESTED IS.

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:05.583
WE MAKE THE STATE INSPECTIONS

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.385
PERHAPS THIRTY MONTHS AND THEN

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:08.386
IT WOULD BE EASIER BECAUSE

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:09.387
PUBLIC HEALTH SAID IT'S

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:10.488
DIFFICULT FOR US BECAUSE THE

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:12.090
TIMING IS DIFFERENT. WELL IF

00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:13.791
YOU MAKE ONE THIRTY MONTHS AND

00:33:13.858 --> 00:33:14.292
ONE FIFTEEN MONTHS IT'S

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:17.161
RELATIVELY EASY. TO BE ABLE TO

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:18.796
DO THOSE INSPECTIONS TOGETHER

00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:19.797
BECAUSE THE STATE INSPECTIONS

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:21.766
ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:22.533
BECAUSE SOME OF THE

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.102
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN STATE

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:26.037
LAW ARE MORE STRINGENT. AND

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:28.106
MORE ARE NOT ACTUALLY WILL DO A

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:30.174
BETTER JOB OF ENSURING QUALITY

00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:32.777
OF CARE IN CALIFORNIA SO- THE

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:33.845
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THE

00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:34.979
STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:35.947
MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING THEIR

00:33:36.013 --> 00:33:37.382
FOR THOSE STATE RELICENSING

00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:39.851
INSPECTIONS- WE MADE A

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:41.052
RECOMMENDATION THE LEGISLATURE

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:43.154
THAT REQUIRES PUBLIC HEALTH TO

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:44.222
CONDUCT THOSE STATE. AND

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:45.456
FEDERAL INSPECTIONS

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.325
CONCURRENTLY AND I ALS WANTTO

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:48.626
POINT OUT WHAT WE SAID IN THE

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:49.761
AUDIT REPORT IS A LEGISLATURE

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:51.829
DID TAKE ACTION BACK IN TWO

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.431
THOUSAND SEVEN. THAT GAVE THE

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:54.499
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THE

00:33:54.565 --> 00:33:56.234
AUTHORITY TO DO DUAL

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.668
INSPECTIONS GO OUT THERE DO

00:33:57.735 --> 00:33:59.137
YOUR FEDERAL INSPECTION AND

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:00.304
YOUR STATE INSPECTION AT THE

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:01.572
SAME TIME THEY ALREADY HAVE THE

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:03.441
AUTHORITY TO DO THAT- BUT THEY

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:04.942
WEREN'T DOING IT AND THAT WE

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:05.977
STILL THINK THAT'S A VERY

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:07.445
IMPORTANT STEP THAT DEPARTMENT

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:09.213
PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS TO TAKE IS.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.314
GET THOSE TWO INSPECTIONS

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:11.816
COMBINED MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.017
THE STATE INSPECTION THE

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:16.854
RELICENSING INSPECTION WHEN

00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:17.355
YOU'RE DOING THE FEDERAL

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.756
INSPECTION- PARTICULARLY

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:20.691
IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOKED AT.

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:22.393
THE NUMBER OF STATE FEDERAL OR

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.128
STATE RELICENSING INSPECTIONS

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:24.862
THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.764
PERFORMING. WE LOOKED AT TWO

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:28.299
YEARS BECAUSE IT'S A TWENTY

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:29.434
FOUR MONTH. THEY WERE SUPPOSED

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.668
TO DO ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:31.636
THEY WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:32.970
LITTLE OVER FOUR HUNDRED SO

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:33.805
THEY'RE DOING ABOUT FORTY

00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:35.740
PERCENT. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:37.742
WHEN WE DUG A LITTLE DEEPER

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:39.210
MANY OF THOSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:41.078
OCCURRING AND LOS ANGELES.

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:42.413
BECAUSE L. A. COUNTY OF COURSE

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.915
HAS A HIGH NUMBER OF NURSING

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:45.650
HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:46.784
FOUND THAT MOST OF THE

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.419
FACILITIES AND THE LOS ANGELES

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:49.554
AREA WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.956
AUDIT. HAD NOT BEEN GETTING NO

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:53.858
STATE RELICENSING INSPECTION SO

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.393
AGAIN SOMETHING VERY VERY

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.093
IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.995
CALIFORNIA. SO WE WOULD

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.430
REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:03.000
THAT. THE NEXT AREA CITATIONS-

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:04.368
AND CITATIONS ARE IMPORTANT OF

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:06.871
COURSE- TO TWO THINGS RELATED

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:08.639
TO CITATIONS THAT WE TALK ABOUT

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:10.675
IN THE AUDIT REPORT. TIMELINESS

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:12.109
AND WHETHER OR NOT IT REALLY IS

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:13.911
AN INCENTIVE FOR A FACILITY TO

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:16.514
IMPROVE A PENALTY THE UP TO P2P

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:18.749
HAVE TO PAY A PENALTY. WHAT WE

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:20.685
FOUND WITH- TIMELINESS. THE

00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:22.019
STATE LAW REQUIRES PUBLIC

00:35:22.086 --> 00:35:23.588
HEALTH ISSUE A CITATION WITHIN

00:35:23.654 --> 00:35:25.556
THIRTY DAYS. AFTER COMPLETING

00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:27.959
AN INVESTIGATION- BUT WHEN WE

00:35:28.025 --> 00:35:30.194
LOOKED AT THAT TIME FRAME TWO

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:30.728
THOUSAND SIX TWO THOUSAND

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.997
FIFTEEN. THEY ISSUED MORE THAN

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:33.865
ELEVEN HUNDRED OF THEIR

00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:34.999
CITATIONS ISSUED ABOUT FOUR

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.201
THOUSAND. THEY ISSUED ELEVEN

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:38.936
HUNDRED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS.

00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:40.872
NOT THIRTY DAYS MORE THAN SIX

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:41.939
MONTHS AFTER THEY COMPLETED

00:35:42.006 --> 00:35:44.242
THAT INSPECTION. SO THAT IS

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:47.211
VERY POOR PERFORMANCE- ONLY

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:51.916
ABOUT- 60% OR SO- WERE WITHIN.

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:54.252
NOW 67% WERE MORE THAN THIRTY

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:56.787
DAYS. 28% WERE MORE THAN SIX

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.723
MONTHS SO SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:00.525
THE CITATIONS BEING ISSUED VERY

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:02.727
VERY LATE. WHEN YOU COMPARE IT

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:04.161
TO THE STATE- LAW REQUIREMENT

00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:07.331
OF THIRTY DAYS. NOW ARE THESE.

00:36:07.398 --> 00:36:08.933
PENALTIES SERVING AS AN

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.868
EFFECTIVE DISINCENTIVE OR AN

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:13.004
INCENTIVE FORCE FACILITIES TO

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.039
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE.

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:16.407
AND AGAIN WE FOUND THAT NOT

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:19.210
NECESSARILY TO BE TRUE- BECAUSE

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:21.045
A LOT OF THE FACILITIES WERE

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:24.448
ABLE TO LATER PAID FOR. THE

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.083
CITATION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AND

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.985
THEY GET A 35% DISCOUNT TO

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:30.588
CENTER- AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:32.056
PAY AND THAT'S STILL IN STATE

00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:32.857
LAW THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:34.692
FULL AMOUNT. BUT WHAT WE WERE

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:35.993
MORE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.329
AMOUNT FOR THOSE CITATIONS THE

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:40.131
AMOUNTS FOR MANY OF THEM HAD

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:40.898
NOT BEEN CHANGED FOR A LONG

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:44.302
TIME- IN FACT SOME HAD BEEN THE

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:46.337
SAME AMOUNT SINCE BACK IN TWO

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:47.805
THOUSAND EARLY TWO THOUSANDS.

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.040
AND WE COMPLETED THE AUDIT AND

00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:50.675
ISSUED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:52.209
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND WE

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:53.978
HAVE IT IN IN THE HAND OUT.

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:56.681
THAT AB THREE TWENTY THREE

00:36:56.747 --> 00:36:59.050
ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA BILL WAS-

00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:00.618
ACTUALLYSIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:02.119
LAST NIGHT. THAT IS A

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:03.621
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE

00:37:03.688 --> 00:37:05.790
THAT DID INCREASE THOSE. A

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:07.258
CITATION AMOUNTS FOR ALL THE

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:08.492
CITATIONS ACROSS THE BORDER

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:09.594
TOOK A QUICK LOOK AT THE BILL

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.128
THIS MORNING AND ABSOLUTELY IT

00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:12.964
INCREASES A LOT OF THOSE. SO

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.600
THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE AN

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:16.500
INCENTIVE FOR SOME OF THESE

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.736
FACILITIES TO WANT TO IMPROVE

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:20.204
THE QUALITY OF CARE AND IN

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:21.872
THEIR AND THEIR PARTICULAR-

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:24.208
NURSING HOMES. ONE THING THAT

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:25.242
IT WAS NOT IN HIS BILL THAT

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:27.011
WASN'T A BILL IN THE PAST WAS

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.613
THE INFLATION FACTOR WE WERE

00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:29.580
SUGGESTING THERE SHOULD BE AN

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:31.816
INFLATION FACTOR- THERE WAS A

00:37:31.882 --> 00:37:33.818
BILL. MR CALLER AGAIN AUTHORED

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:36.287
A BILL- A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:37.788
SUBSEQUENT TO THE AUDIT THAT

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:39.857
DID INCLUDE THAT. INFLATION

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:41.158
FACTOR UNFORTUNATELY THAT BILL

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:42.827
WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR WE

00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:44.095
WOULD BELIEVE THAT THAT IS

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.696
SOMETHING THAT AGAIN EVEN

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:48.366
THOUGH THERE IS SIGNIFICANT

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:48.933
IMPROVEMENT WITH IT WITH THE

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.267
BILL THAT WAS. SIGNED HAVING AN

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:52.069
INFLATION FACTOR ALSO IS VERY

00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:54.238
VERY IMPORTANT. FOR CALIFORNIA

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:55.806
AND I THINK IT WILL AGAIN BE AN

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:57.108
INCENTIVE FOR SOME OF THESE

00:37:57.174 --> 00:37:59.310
FACILITIES THESE THESE. PENALTY

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:00.411
AMOUNTS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.812
TO GO UP AT LEAST ANNUALLY

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:04.348
BASED ON CPI SO YOU KNOW WHAT I

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:05.650
NEED TO IMPROVE THE CARE I

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:06.917
DON'T HAVE TO KEEP PAYING

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:09.954
THESE. THESE THESE CITATIONS

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:10.821
THE CITATION AMOUNTS THESE

00:38:10.888 --> 00:38:14.258
PENALTIES. SO AGAIN THE

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:15.259
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:17.161
NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:17.962
GETTING ALL CITATIONS ISSUED

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:19.797
TIMELY. I THINK THAT THE

00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:21.298
INCREASE IN THE IN THE AMOUNT

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:22.800
OF THE CITATIONS HOPEFULLY WILL

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:25.503
BE AN INCENTIVE. FOR THE

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:28.305
FACILITIES TO IMPROVE THE

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:28.839
QUALITY OF CARE THAT THEY

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:31.575
PROVIDE. SO MOVING ON TO JUST A

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.577
COUPLE MARC MAUER AREAS

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:34.712
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WE LOOKED AT

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.847
THE- THE QUALITY OF CARE

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:39.116
IMPROVEMENT THE A. Q. A. S. P.

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:40.284
WHICH WAS INTENDED TO

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:41.819
INCENTIVIZE NURSING HOMES TO

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.821
IMPROVE. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:44.922
CONDUCTED THE AUDIT WE FOUND

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:45.956
THAT A LOT OF FACILITIES

00:38:46.023 --> 00:38:47.191
WEREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:48.526
FUNDS BECAUSE THEY EITHER HAD

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:50.294
SOME DEFICIENCIES. OR THEY HAD

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:52.563
SOME CITATIONS BUT WHAT WE DID

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.298
FIND IS THOSE THAT WERE

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:55.733
ELIGIBLE FOR THE QUALITY

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.835
IMPROVEMENT PAYMENTS. YOU DID

00:38:57.902 --> 00:38:59.170
SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IT WITH

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:01.138
THOSE FACILITIES THEY GOT THAT

00:39:01.205 --> 00:39:02.273
MONEY THEY WERE ABLE TO INVEST

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:03.541
THAT MONEY IN THE QUALITY OF

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:04.408
CARE IMPROVED AT THOSE

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:05.843
FACILITIES SO THERE'S INCENTIVE

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.545
PAYMENTS ARE IMPORTANT. IT WAS

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.280
JUST FOR US- WHEN WE CONDUCTED

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:11.182
THE AUDIT WE FOUND THAT. THE

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:13.851
WAY THE- THE PROGRAM WAS SET UP

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:16.120
AS IS MANY FACILITIES AND

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:17.722
TYPICALLY THE ONES THAT ARE NOT

00:39:17.788 --> 00:39:19.890
AS PROFITABLE REALLY STRUGGLE

00:39:19.957 --> 00:39:21.892
TO EVEN QUALIFY FOR THE

00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:23.794

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.296
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THERE AS

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:28.466
WELL AS FAR AS- OCCUPIED

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:29.767
CREATING A SCHEDULE THAT WOULD

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:31.769

IMPROVEMENTS- OCCUPIED IS

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:41.278
SUGGESTING. THAT THEY NEEDED TO

00:39:41.345 --> 00:39:42.913
DO A REGULATORY CHANGE SO THEY

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.248
HAVEN'T FULLY IMPLEMENTED THAT

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.983
RECOMMENDATION YET BUT AGAIN WE

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.618
STILL FEEL. THAT THAT'S VERY

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:48.919
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S ALL

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.554

LEGISLATION ESTABLISHED AND IT

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.935
ALLOWED US AS A STATE TO GET

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:07.338
MORE FEDERAL MATCHING MONEY. WE

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:08.539
SUGGESTED THERE SHOULD PERHAPS

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:09.940

RISK BASED ASSESSMENT WHICH

00:41:32.423 --> 00:41:34.658
AUDITORS DO IF THERE'S NON

PROFITS ABOVE A CERTAIN

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.428
THRESHOLD WE NEED OR IF

THERE'S- A CHANGE WE START

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:40.331
LOOKING AT TRENDS AND THERE'S A

00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:41.799
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THEN THAT

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:42.967
MIGHT BE A PLACE THAT THE

00:41:43.033 --> 00:41:44.802
AUDITORS AT DH CS MIGHT WANT TO

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:46.470
LOOK AT. SO THAT BILL CERTAINLY

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:50.274

TRANSPARENCY. THE OTHER AREA

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:56.280
THAT WE THINK NEEDS- NEEDED

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:57.381
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN FULLY

00:41:57.448 --> 00:41:59.416

00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:22.806
FIVE LINES ON THE FORM SO

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:23.807
BASICALLY WHAT OCCUPIED WAS

00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:25.576

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:08.552
INDIVIDUAL- THE GRAPHIC ON PAGE

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.587
EIGHT OF THE HANDOUT SHOWS THAT

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.722

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:20.897
UNDERSTANDABLY WITH THE

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:23.333
ADDITION OF NEW POSITIONS IN

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:23.867
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THIS ALSO

00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:25.902
HAPPENED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:26.903
WHEN NEW POSITIONS WERE ADDED

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.838
AND ALSO BECAUSE OF COATED. THE

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.206
DEPARTMENT EXPERIENCED MORE

00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:33.143
DEPARTURES AND RETIREMENTS THAN

00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:33.643
WOULD HAVE NORMALLY BEEN

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.546
EXPECTED- BUT THE THING I WANT

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:40.116
TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT FROM

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:40.684
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:41.651
TWENTY ONE. THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.620
WORKLOAD ANALYSIS INDICATED

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:44.955
THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDED MANY

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:47.123
MORE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS TO

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:49.326

CERTIFICATION OF HEALTH

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.263
FACILITIES. THE DEPARTMENT

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.864
DIDN'T REQUEST ADDITIONAL

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:55.966
POSITIONS HOWEVER BECAUSE IT

00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:57.934
WAS HAVING TROUBLE FILLING OPEN

00:53:58.001 --> 00:53:59.169
POSITIONS THAT I ALREADY HAD A

00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:00.770
THIRTY FOUR. SO IT DIDN'T MAKE

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:02.606
ANOTHER REQUEST UNTIL TWENTY

00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:03.607
TWENTY WHEN THE VACANCY RATE

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:05.275
HAD GOTTEN DOWN TO THREE POINT

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:07.744
6% AND THEN OF COURSE COVERED

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:11.047
NINETEEN HIT. AND WE HAVE NEW

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:12.682
CHALLENGES- BECAUSE OF THAT. IF

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:14.384
YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE I WAS

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:16.486
GOING TO MENTION. SOME OF THE

00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:18.888
PERFORMANCE METRICS IN A COUPLE

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:22.459
OF ADDITIONAL AREAS- SO FIRST

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:23.994
IS CENTRALIZED APPLICATION

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.464
PROCESSING SO IN FIFTEEN

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:28.765
SIXTEEN THE DEPARTMENT WRIST-

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:30.500
BEGAN TO CENTRALIZE SORT OF

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:32.035
STEP ONE OF THE APPLICATION

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:34.204
PROCESS BASICALLY. DEALING WITH

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.740
THE PAPERWORK AND THINGS

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:37.340
ASSOCIATED WITH REVIEWING THE

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:40.143
APPLICATION. BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:41.878
THE DEPARTMENT HAS INDICATED

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:43.947
THAT IT REALIZED IT HAD UNDER

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:46.516
ESTIMATED THE WORK. ASSOCIATED

00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:47.384
WITH PROCESSING THOSE

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.652
APPLICATIONS AND IT BEGAN TO

00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:54.124
HIRE. IT REQUESTED AUTHORITY

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.659
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS TO

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:57.827
MAKE THOSE POSITIONS PERMANENT.

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:59.562
THE GRAPHIC ON PAGE NINE SHOWS

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:00.563
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.565
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROCESSING

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:05.669
TIMES AN AGE OF OPEN

00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:06.169
APPLICATIONS DURING THIS

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:09.806
INITIAL STEP- SO FOR EXAMPLE BY

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:12.108
QUARTER TWO OF NINETEEN TWENTY

00:55:12.175 --> 00:55:14.310
THE NUMBER OF OPEN APPLICATIONS

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:15.378
HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY MORE THAN

00:55:15.445 --> 00:55:17.847
HALF COMPARED TO SEVENTEEN

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:18.782
EIGHTEEN AND NEARLY TWO THIRDS

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:20.684
HAD ONLY BEEN OPEN. FOR ABOUT A

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.552
HUNDRED DAYS OR LESS STILL THIS

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.020
CAN TAKE SOME TIME SO FOR

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:25.755
EXAMPLE THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:27.490
APPLICATIONS WHICH I KNOW IS OF

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:29.459
PARTICULAR INTEREST- THE

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:30.794
CURRENT MEDIAN AGE OF AN

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.028
APPLICATION IS ABOUT NINE

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.163
MONTHS AND THIS IS JUST THE

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:35.832
FIRST STEP OF THE CHANGE OF

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.734
OWNERSHIP APPLICATION PROCESS.

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:38.935
SO THE SECOND STEP IF YOU TURN

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:41.071
TO PAGE TEN AND INVOLVES THE ON

00:55:41.137 --> 00:55:44.074
SITE. SURVEY AND THEN OF COURSE

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.341
THESE ARE ALSO CONDUCTED AS THE

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:49.045
REGULAR- PART OF. RENEWING THE

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:51.981
LICENSE AND RE CERTIFICATION-

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:54.617
THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED THE

00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:56.853
TIMELINESS OF COMPLETION OF

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.955
THESE LICENSOR LICENSURE

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:01.825
SURVEYS. SO AT THE END OF MARCH

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:03.226
THERE WERE THIRTY TWO

00:56:03.293 --> 00:56:05.161
APPLICATIONS AWAITING A SURVEY.

00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:06.296
AND THE MEDIAN AGE OF THESE

00:56:06.362 --> 00:56:08.698
APPLICATION- LICENSURE SURVEY

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:09.933
SURVEYS TO COMPLETE THE

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:13.670
APPLICATION WAS NEARLY ONE YEAR-

00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:15.772
SO IF WE GO BACK TO OUR EXAMPLE

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:16.306
OF THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:19.509
APPLICATION. IN MARCH TWENTY

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:20.944
TWENTY ONE THE MEDIAN AGE OF

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.345
THE APPLICATIONS AWAITING A

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:24.447
LICENSE OR SURVEY WAS ABOUT

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:25.915
THREE HUNDRED DAYS. THIS MEANS

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:27.117
THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS FROM

00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:28.451
START TO FINISH FOR A CHANGE OF

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:30.787
OWNERSHIP COULD TAKE. A YEAR

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:36.559
AND A HALF OR MORE. I'M NEXT I

00:56:36.626 --> 00:56:38.528
WOULD- JUST HIGHLIGHT A

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:40.597
COMPLAINT THE COMPLETION OF

00:56:40.663 --> 00:56:42.732
COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS-

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:44.267
THERE'S A GRAPHIC ON PAGE

00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:49.105
ELEVEN. SO AS YOU KNOW- THE

00:56:49.172 --> 00:56:50.607
STATE BUDGET IN FIFTEEN

00:56:50.673 --> 00:56:52.909
SIXTEEN. I REQUIRED THE

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:54.244
DEPARTMENT TO BEGIN PHASING IN

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.512
SHORTER TIMELINES TO TURN

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:57.747
AROUND COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS

00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:58.748
AND IT TASTED IN MORE

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:00.116
AGGRESSIVELY FOR THOSE.

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:01.251
COMPLAINTS THAT INVOLVED

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:03.720
IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY- SO SINCE

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:05.188
JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALL OF

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:06.556
THESE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:08.424
HAVE TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.460
SIXTY DAYS. HOWEVER THE GRAPHIC

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:13.596
SHOWS THAT SINCE THE RECORD THE

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:14.798
SIXTY DAY REQUIREMENT TOOK

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:15.899
EFFECT THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:17.600
MET THE TIMELINE IN AT LEAST

00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:19.769
10% OF THE- OF CASES AND THIS

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:22.639
IS BECOME NOTABLY WORSE SINCE

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:24.541
THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. I'M

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:26.543
SO THE LAST THING I WOULD JUST

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:28.678
MENTION A IS ENFORCEMENT WHICH

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:30.780
HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED BUT

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:32.448
I WOULD JUST ALSO POINT OUT

00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:34.450
THAT- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

00:57:34.517 --> 00:57:36.386
YEARS. THE DEPRTMENT TOOK ON

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:38.121
AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:40.490
DAYS TO ISSUE MORE THAN TWO

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:41.658
TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PENALTIES

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:42.792
ASSOCIATED WITH THE MORE

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:45.695
SERIOUS SORT OF TYPE A AND TYPE

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:49.232
A- TYPE B. VIOLATIONS-

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.867
FACILITIES CAN APPEAL THESE

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:53.870
PENALTIES WHICH FURTHER- DELAYS

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:55.638
THE ENFORCEMENT ACTION. AND

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:56.773
THEN THIS IS PARTICULARLY

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.641
COMPLICATED IFISA FACILITY IS

00:57:58.708 --> 00:57:59.509
UNDERGOING A CHANGE OF

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:02.946
OWNERSHIP- AND IF THAT PART OF

00:58:03.012 --> 00:58:04.814
THE PROCESS IS ALSO DELAYED-

00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:06.783
YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE THAT

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.352
COULD SORT OF COMPLICATED ABOUT

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:09.919
WHO'S WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:12.956
WHAT. SO I JUST WANT TO END. IF

00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.224
YOU TURN TO PAGE TWELVE WITH

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.325
SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:58:15.391 --> 00:58:17.560
CONSIDERATION WELLTHIS HEARING

00:58:17.627 --> 00:58:19.262
IS NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:20.496
COVERT NINETEEN WE KNOW THAT

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:21.931
COVERED NINETEEN IS REVEALED

00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:24.167
SOME ISSUES IN. ITS SOME

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:25.235
LONGSTANDING ISSUES AND SKILLED

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:27.303
NURSING FACILITIES HIGHLIGHTING

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:28.004
THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:30.340
OVERSIGHT. YET OF THE PANDEMIC

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:31.641
HAS ALSO HAMPERED THE

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:33.042
DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT

00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:34.244
ITS OVERSIGHT FOR A COUPLE OF

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:35.678
REASONS NOT ONLY IS IT HARDER

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:37.280
TO CONDUCT TO THE ON SITE

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.349
INVESTIGATIONS. BUT THE STAFF

00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:40.750
IS REALLY HAD TO PRIORITIZE

00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:43.086
THINGS LIKE INFECTION CONTROL-

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:45.054
SORT OF AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:47.056
COMPLIANCE MONITORING AND THEN

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:48.758
IN ADDITION WE HAVE THE HIGHER

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:50.126
VACANCIES FOR THE NURSE

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:52.562
SURVEYOR POSITIONS. AND IN FACT

00:58:52.629 --> 00:58:54.097
A RECENT STATISTICS FROM THE

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:56.099
DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE SHOWS THAT

00:58:56.165 --> 00:58:57.300
THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT YET

00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:58.635
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW

00:58:58.701 --> 00:59:01.170
POSITION OF AUTHORITY- APPROVED

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:04.040
IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO JUST

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:05.875
SOME ISSUES THAT WE WOULD RAISE

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:07.176
OR QUESTIONS THAT THE

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:07.977
LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:10.413
CONSIDER IS WHAT HAS BEEN

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.248
LEARNED FROM COVERT NINETEEN

00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:13.216
THAT SHOULD BE BUILT IN

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:14.851
PERMANENTLY TO THE LICENSING

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:17.153
AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM AND

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:17.720
OVERSIGHT OF SKILLED NURSING

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:20.323
FACILITIES- WHAT ADDITIONAL

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:21.758
TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS WOULD

00:59:21.824 --> 00:59:23.259
HELP THE PROGRAM NOT ONLY TO

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:24.894
IMPROVE TIMELINES BUT TO ALSO

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:26.562
IMPROVE CONSISTENCY. AND

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:28.798
QUALITY OF OVERSIGHT- WHAT HAS

00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:30.800
BEEN THE EFFECT OF CENTRALIZING

00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:33.269
SOME OF THE TASKS THAT THE

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:34.504
DEPARTMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.940
FROM APPLICATION PROCESSING TO

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:38.641
MEDICAL BREACH INVESTIGATIONS

00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:40.576
IN POLICY INTERPRETATION. HOW

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:43.046
IS IT HELPED AND HASN'T LED TO

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:45.181
ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND

00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:46.349
THEN JUST HOW DOES THE

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.251
DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO ADDRESS-

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.953
CHALLENGES SUCH AS HIRING AND

RETAINING NURSE SURVEYORS AND

00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:56.292
SPEEDING UP- THE APPLICATION.

01:03:55.731 --> 01:04:00.570
SITUATION WHERE EVEN THOUGH A-

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:02.605

EXAMPLE OF THE WINDS ARE

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:50.172

THIS FACILITY WINDS ARE READING.

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:11.160
THE APPLICATION WAS DENIED AND

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:13.062
TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND YET THE

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:14.463
OPERATION OF THE NURSING HOME

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.799
CONTINUES WITH THE LICENSEE

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.535
BEING THE PREVIOUS OWNER WINS

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:23.539
ARE READY RIGHT. I MEAN WHAT.

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:28.711
WHAT IF ANY. PUBLIC PROTECTION

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:31.414
CONSUMER PROTECTION FUNCTION.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.284
DOES TREATING THE LICENSEE OF

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:40.022
THE PREVIOUS OWNER- SERVE- IN

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:42.258
IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE.

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.993
WELL I I'M NOT SURE THERE IS A

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:45.528
MINUTE AGAIN I HAVE TO DEFER TO

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:46.695
PUBLIC HEALTH BUT THAT WOULD BE

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:48.931
A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN SO IF

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.966
YOUR GOING TO DENY THE LICENSE

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:54.570
OF THE NEW OWNER. BASED ON-

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.672
CITATIONS DEFICIENCIES THAT THE

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:59.742
PREVIOUS LICENSEE- EXPERIENCED

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:01.143
AS FAR AS PUBLIC HEALTH

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:02.745
PROVIDING OVERSIGHT THEN I

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:04.113
WOULD THINK THAT THE STATE OF

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.181
CALIFORNIA WOULD WANT TO MOVE

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.715
FORWARD AND SUGGESTED THAT

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.617
FACILITY SHOULD NOT BE LICENSE

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:09.418
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.420
SAYING AS FAR AS- IT HAD BEEN

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:13.856
DENIED. BUT AND I DON'T HAVE

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.858
THE EXPERTISE TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:16.759
ARE THE NEXT STEPS THAT THE

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:18.527
STATE WOULD NEED TO TAKE TO

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:19.595
MAKE SURE THAT THAT FACILITY

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:20.930
DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:23.499
OPERATE IF IT HAS HAD A HISTORY

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.768
OF DEFICIENCIES AND BEING CITED

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.803
BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.271
THE NEW OWNERSHIP HAS BEEN

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.207
DENIED A LICENSE THAT THAT

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.843
THAT. TO ME FROM PERSONAL

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:36.345
PERSPECTIVE- IS NOT A GOOD

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:38.180
SITUATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.449
ARE OR HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS- IN

01:08:40.516 --> 01:08:42.218
THAT PARTICULAR NURSING HOME

01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:43.285
BUT AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:44.887
EXPERTISE TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:47.590

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:02.331
AND AND MR RECHNITZ FOR THE

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:06.702

LOOKING AT THE PROCESS WE HAD

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:56.885

WHEN OUR STAFF LOOKED AT THAT

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:08.664

DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:12.868
WHICH- OF THE PROPOSED

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.970
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEGISLATION

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:15.604
AND OVERSIGHT ARE MOST URGENTLY

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.507
NEEDED. OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:20.242

PRIORITY NUMBER ONE OR PRIORITY

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:32.054
NUMBER TWO WELL I THINK-

BILL- MISTER KALRA BUILD THOSE

ARE ALL WE ALL REALLY- I THINK

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:41.630
EXCELLENT STEPS IN THE RIGHT

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.332
DIRECTION TO IMPROVE.

01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:44.900
CALIFORNIA'S OVERSIGHT OF

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:46.768
NURSING HOME FACILITIES IN

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:48.704
CALIFORNIA. THE THEY WON

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:49.705
OUTSTANDING RECOMMENDATION THAT

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:51.974
WE HAD- WITH RESPECT TO

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.475
LEGISLATION IT A COUPLE OF

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:55.043
THEM. THE ONE RELATED TO THE RE

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.079
INSPECTIONS TO TRY TO GET THE

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:59.181
TIMELINE SIMILAR BECAUSE- IT

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:00.415
WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT FOR

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:01.416
PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO GO

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:02.784
OUT THERE AND DO THE FEDERAL

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:03.919
INSPECTION WHICH THEY HAVE TO

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:05.287
DO EVERY FIFTEEN MONTHS. AND

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.622
GET THAT STATE. ARE RE

01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:09.091
LICENSING RECERTIFICATION

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.826
INSPECTION DONE BECAUSE AGAIN

01:17:10.892 --> 01:17:12.127
AS I SAID SOME OF THE STATE

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:12.828
REQUIREMENTS ARE MORE

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:15.163
STRINGENT. AND FOR THE PUBLIC

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.131
HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.299
THOSE AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:18.867
SATISFYING REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.602
FEDERAL. CERTIFICATION FOR

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.137
MEDICARE MEDICARE AT CETERA I

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:24.840
MEAN MEDICARE- WOULD BE REALLY

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:27.075
REALLY. IMPORTANT THE ONLY

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:28.110
OTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT WE

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:30.178
HAD LEGISLATIVELY REALLY WAS

01:17:30.245 --> 01:17:31.213
RELATED TO THE QUALITY

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:34.216
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- BECAUSE AS

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:35.183
WE MENTIONED IN THE AUDIT

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:37.285
REPORT I BRIEFLY MENTIONED- A

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:38.920
LOT OF FACILITIES. DIDN'T

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.522
QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY HAD

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:41.423
CITATIONS THEY HAVE

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.824
DEFICIENCIES SO MAYBE THERE

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.126
NEEDS TO BE SOME RESTRUCTURING

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:46.128
THERE. BECAUSE THOSE THAT DID

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:47.329
RECEIVE THOSE INCENTIVE

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:48.997
PAYMENTS WE DID SEE WHEN WE

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:51.433
LOOK AT THE INDICATORS- AS FAR

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.468
AS- AND THEIR QUALITY OF CARE

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:54.870
SCORES COMPARED TO THE

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:55.937
STATEWIDE AVERAGE THEY GOT

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.606
BETTER THEY DID IMPROVE SO

01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:59.741
THERE'S INCENTIVE PAYMENTS-

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:01.910
DID. AFFECT CHANGE THEY THEY

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:04.613
WERE WORTHWHILE SO- I THINK THE

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.548
RE LICENSURE TO GETTING THOSE

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:09.184
TWO TIME FRAMES TO MERA I MEAN

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.085
ONE FIFTEEN MONTHS ONE THIRTY

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:12.220
BUT- EASY ENOUGH- WOULD BE

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:13.388
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:15.424
THOSE IN REAL RE CERTIFICATION

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.159
RELICENSING INSPECTIONS ARE ARE

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:18.093
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.295
STATE. SO THAT SEEMS REALLY

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:22.831
SIMPLE REALLY RUDIMENTARY AND I

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:24.166
GOT THE IMPRESSION FROM AN

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:27.536
EARLIER COMMENT THAT THEY

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:28.136
ACTUALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:28.603
DO THAT. THEYHAVE THE

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:29.371
AUTHORITY DO THAT WILL ANSWER

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:30.605
SO WHAT WE MENTION IN THE AUDIT

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:32.107
REPORT IS A TWO THOUSAND AND

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:33.175
SEVEN LINE I REMEMBER LOOKING

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:35.177
AT IT FOR YOU. AUTHORIZED DUAL

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:36.611
INSPECTIONS WERE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:18:36.678 --> 01:18:37.512
CAN GO AND WE'RE GONNA

01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:38.713
INSPECTOR FOR THE FEDERAL

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.082
REQUIREMENTS WERE EXPECTED AT

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:41.149
THE SAME TIME FOR THE STATE

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.651
REQUIREMENTS. BUT WHEN WE DID

01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:43.985
THE OTTAWA PUBLIC HEALTH SAID

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.520
IS. WELL THE TIME FRAMES ARE

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:46.521
DIFFERENT IT'S HARD TO

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.023
COORDINATE THIS ONE'S FIFTEEN

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:49.257
MONTHS THIS ONE TWENTY FOUR

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:50.892
STATES TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. WE

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:51.927
SAIDOKAY WELL WE'LL MAKE THE

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:52.961
STATE THIRTY MONTHS AND THEN

01:18:53.028 --> 01:18:54.830
IT'S EASY ENOUGH. BECAUSE YOU

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:57.666
DO THE FEDERAL AND YOU KNOW

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:59.501
IT'S LIKE EVERY TWO YEARS. IT'S

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.570
SERVICE RUN BY SOMEONE WHO YOU.

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:03.772
SAMPLE THING TO CHANGE. SO IS

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:05.707
IT YOUR IMPRESSION IT'S OF. A

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:07.375
WILL OR OR IS THERE SOME

01:19:07.442 --> 01:19:09.044
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AS

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:11.079
PREVENTING THEM FROM DOING THIS

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:12.647
OFTENTIMES WILL SEE. BUT

01:19:12.714 --> 01:19:13.849
DEPARTMENTS HAVE AUTHORITY TO

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:15.016
DO SOMETHING BUT THEY DON'T

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.318
EXERCISE IT UNTIL THEIR IT'S

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:17.786
EXPLICITLY TOLD BY THE

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:19.988
LEGISLATURE YOU HAVE TO DO THIS

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:20.856
SO I'M KIND UNDERSTRENGTH

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.290
STAND. DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:25.994
pJUST CHOOSING TO NOT FOR

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.796
WHATEVER VARIETY REASONS OR ARE

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:29.631
THEY WAITING FOR US TO SAY. YOU

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:31.967
HAVE TO DO THIS. GO AHEAD

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:37.139
PLEASE. IF YOU THE BUTTON THERE

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:38.406
TOO I THINK THE RED LIGHT NEEDS

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:40.142
TO BE ON FOR US IS IT I CAN'T

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:43.712
SEE FROM RIGHT- SO THERE IS A

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:45.947
DISCONNECT AND STAY LAW IN

01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:47.282
TERMS OF THE TIMING IF YOU

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:49.151
INCREASED IT LIKE- THE STATE

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:51.186
AUDITOR SAID FROM THE TWENTY

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:51.753
FOUR MONTHS TO THE THIRTY

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.188
MONTHS IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:54.523
FOR THEM TO SCHEDULE AND MORE

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:55.724
EFFICIENT FOR THEM TO SCHEDULE

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:58.093
THOSE. RELICENSING INSPECTIONS

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.295
I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW- IN THE

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:01.429
INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:02.664
AS PART OF THIS HEARING THERE

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:03.598
SAYING THEY'RE CONDUCTING THE

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:05.300
INSPECTIONS ON AVERAGE EVERY

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:05.967
TWELVE MONTHS AND I THINK

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:07.302
THAT'S AN INABILITY TO TRY TO

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:09.337
CREATE SOME EFFICIENCIES BUT IF

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:11.706
THE LAW WAS CHANGED FROM THE

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:14.476
TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF THE

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:15.110
THIRTY MONTH THEY WOULD MAKE IT

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.278
MORE EFFICIENT FOR THEM. OKAY

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:18.246
WELL. IT YES I JUST WONDER HOW

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.714
MUCH FLEXIBILITY THEY ACTUALLY

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:21.816
HAVE TO DO THIS AND- AND IT IT

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.952
IT SEEMS SO SIMPLE- BUT YOU

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:27.055
KNOW. REMEMBER WHERE WE ARE

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.323
IT'S NOT ALWAYS NOTHING IS

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.224
ALWAYS THAT SIMPLE SO

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:32.027
APPARENTLY SO- FROM THANK YOU.

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:33.929
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT MISS

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:35.730
PETTICOAT THANK YOU ALSO FOR

01:20:35.797 --> 01:20:37.632
YOUR PRESENTATION AND I WAS

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:38.867
OPPOSITE SPECIALLY INTERESTED

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:40.936
IN IN ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YOU

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.971
KNOW THAT THAT HAVE SWINE AND

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:44.406
FOR CONSIDERATION AND YOUR YOUR

01:20:44.472 --> 01:20:46.841
COMMENTS WERE THOUGHTFUL. SO AS

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:49.945
WE LOOK AT THE AT THE STAFFING

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:53.748
ISSUES- DO YOU THINK THIS IS A

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:56.685
BUDGETARY OR RESISTS. MAKE THE

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:58.853
MECHANICS IN NOW HAVE WE HAVE

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.589
WE AT SOME POINT REDUCE THE

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:02.691
BUDGET TO ALLOW FOR IT DID NOT

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:06.061
MAKE THIS. DOABLE FOR FOLKS OR

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:08.730
FOR THE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OR

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.498
IS THIS JUST. IS THE PAY

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:12.234
STRUCTURE SO SUCH THAT IT'S

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.736
HARD TO ATTRACT PEOPLE. OR IS

01:21:14.803 --> 01:21:16.238
THERE NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO FILL

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:20.675
THE POSITIONS. I THINK IT'S- I

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:22.777
THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.879
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS SO

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:27.315
FOR ONE THING THE JOB IS WELL

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:29.351
FOR ONE THING. A LOT OF THESE

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.720
POSITIONS REQUIRE THE PERSON TO

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:34.422
BE A REGISTERED NURSE SO THERE

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:36.658
MAY BE COMPETING- PRESSURES IN

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:39.127
THE MARKET- BETTER JOB YOU KNOW

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:41.062
BUT OF. DECISIONS PEOPLE WOULD

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:43.365
RATHER TAKE THAN BEING A NURSE-

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:45.867
SURVEYOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT-

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:47.002
IN ADDITION IT'S MY

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:48.570
UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING TO

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:49.704
THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:51.573
SOMETIMES STRUGGLE WITH MORALE

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.141
TAPE ISSUES BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.509
YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING IN AND

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:55.744
YOU'RE BASICALLY LOOKING FOR

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.145
DEFICIENCIES AT THESE

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:58.613
FACILITIES AND IT'S NOT THE

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.549
EASIEST. OF JOBS THE TIME WHAT

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:02.817
THERE'S YOU KNOW PRESSURE WITH

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:04.586
THE TIME LINES THE TURNAROUND

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:07.289
IS REALLY FAST- IT'S SUPPOSED

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.957
TO BE REALLY FAST THERE AND

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:10.759
THEY'RE GOING YOU KNOW. EVERY

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.060
TWO WEEKS OR SO GOING INTO A

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:14.496
NEW- FACILITY TO CONDUCT THIS

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:15.997
WORK SO THE POSITION OF

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:17.866
AUTHORITY HAS BEEN THERE BUT

01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:19.534
THERE HAS BEEN THESE ISSUES

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.503
WITH RETAINING YOU KNOW FIRST

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:23.271
OF ALL THE RECRUITING THE STAFF

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:25.206
AND THEN RETAINING THE STAFF.

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:27.542
AND THE THAT- TIME THAT IT

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.477
TAKES TO REALLY TRAIN SOMEONE

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:31.212
ALSO DOESN'T HELP BECAUSE ONCE

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:33.181
YOU DO HIRE SOMEBODY IT'S-

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:35.016
ANOTHER TWELVE TO FOURTEEN

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.051
MONTHS BEFORE THAT PERSON IS

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:37.519
READY TO GO OUT ON THEIR OWN

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:40.655
AND DO YOU- A SURVEY. OF THE

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:41.790
LAST THING I WOULD MENTION IS

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:43.558
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.760
TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT A

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:47.629
YEAR OR TWO AGO. THEY HAD

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:49.898
BROUGHT IN A CONSULTANT TO HELP

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:51.733
WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.234
I'VE RAISED TO- WHEN IT COMES

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:54.636

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:56.571
INTO THE JOB OR OR RETAINING

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:59.174

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.109
HELPED IT HELPED- GET THAT

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:03.244
VACANCY RATE DOWN TO THREE

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:05.480
POINT SIX- PERCENT BUT IT'S MY

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.314

I'M A PLANNER CIVIL LITIGATOR

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:53.301
WHO HAS PRACTICED IN THE AREA

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:56.504
OF NEGLECT AND ABUSE OF ELDERS

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:57.038
IN NURSING HOMES FOR OVER

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.040
TWENTY YEARS. I WAS ASKED TO

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:00.908
COME HERE TODAY AND TALK TO YOU

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:02.477
ABOUT WHY OWNERSHIP IN NURSING

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:07.081
HOMES MATTER. SO AS IT SOUNDS

01:28:07.148 --> 01:28:08.883
LIKE A LOT OF YOU ALREADY KNOW

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:09.984
THE PRIMARY PROBLEM IN A

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:11.919
NURSING HOME SIMPLY PUT IT IS

01:28:11.986 --> 01:28:14.122
UNDERSTAFFING. STUDY AFTER

01:28:14.188 --> 01:28:16.090
STUDY SHOWS THAT INCREASE

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:17.525
STOPPING LEADS TO HIGHER

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:20.762
QUALITY OF CARE. BUT OBVIOUSLY

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:23.598
IT TAKES MONEY TO INCREASED OFF.

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:25.333
AND MOST NURSING HOMES ON PAPER

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.868
RIGHT IN THE RIDE AND CRY

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:29.871
POVERTY. THIS IS WHILE THE

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:31.039
OWNERS ARE OFTEN MAKING

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:33.574
MILLIONS AND SOMETIMES BILLIONS

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:37.712
OF DOLLARS. 85% OF NURSING HOME

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:40.014
REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM STATE

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:43.251
AND FEDERAL MONEY. SO HOW ARE

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:47.355
WE CREATING BILLIONAIRES. I

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:48.990
CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.925
I'VE HEARD THAT NURSING HOMES

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:53.027
ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND DON'T HAVE

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:55.263
THE MONEY TO HIRE MORE. SINCE

01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:58.466
THE NURSING HOME. IS OFTEN THE

01:28:58.533 --> 01:29:00.568
LAST PLACE THAT MY CLIENTS ARE

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:03.237
EVER GOING TO LIVE. I MAKE IT A

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:07.608
POINT. TO LOOK UP THE HOME. IN

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:09.677
WHICH THE OWNER OF THAT NURSING

01:29:09.744 --> 01:29:13.648
HOME LIVE. AND I STRUGGLE TO

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:16.117
ACCEPT THE PREMISE THAT NURSING

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.586
HOMES ARE UNDERFUNDED WHEN

01:29:18.653 --> 01:29:20.722
THEIR OWNERS ARE LIVING IN

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:24.392
HOMES THAT ARE SOMETIMES WORTH

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:35.336
CONDUCT THAT I AM COVER OVER

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:37.739
AND OVER AGAIN. I HAVE STOPPED

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:40.641
ASKING MYSELF THE QUESTION OF

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:41.275
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S GOING TO

01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:44.078
BE FRAUD. I JUST ASK MYSELF THE

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:47.248
QUESTION CAN I PROVE FRAUD IN

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:49.417
THIS CASE HOW ARE THEY DOING AT

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:53.121
THIS TIME. WHICH IS WHY I VERY

01:29:53.187 --> 01:29:54.922
MUCH APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

01:29:54.989 --> 01:29:56.657

THAT OBVIOUSLY CARE ABOUT THIS

01:29:57.825 --> 01:29:59.794
ISSUE. BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY I

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:00.728
HAVE FELT LIKE I HAVE BEEN

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:03.931
CARRYING ALL OF OUR FUTURES. AS

WE AGE ON MY SHOULDERS AND I

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.703
HAVE FELT LIKE IT HAS BEEN A

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:13.141
VERY LONELY ROAD. TWENTY YEARS

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.142
AGO I FELT LIKE THE DEPARTMENT

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:15.343
OF HEALTH SERVICES NOW THE

01:30:15.409 --> 01:30:17.411
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:21.215
WAS ACTUALLY A PART PARTNER AND

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:21.783
TRYING TO HOLD NURSING HOMES

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:24.952
ACCOUNTABLE. THE REALITY IS NOW

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:26.487
WHEN THE CURRENT CLIENT COMES

01:30:26.554 --> 01:30:27.989
TO ME AND BAD CONDUCT HAS

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:30.992
OCCURRED I DON'T EVEN TELL THEM

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:32.193
TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:33.895
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:36.831
BECAUSE IT IS POINTLESS. MY

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:38.432
EXPERIENCE IS THE AGENCY HAS

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.768
REDUCED ENFORCEMENT. OF QUALITY

SINGLE YEAR AND THE QUALITY OF

01:30:53.047 --> 01:30:55.149

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:56.584
NO CONSISTENCY AND THE

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:58.553
PENALTIES OR THE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:01.322

GOING ON IN THE FACILITY SO

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:35.890

HOW TO REPORT FOR PROFITS

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:31.005
SENATE BILL SIX FIFTY IS A

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:33.274
REALLY GOOD START. TO TRY AND

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.174
BRING SOME DEGREE OF

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:35.809
ACCOUNTABILITY BY REQUIRING

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:37.278
THESE RELATED PARTIES TO

DISCLOSE PROFIT AND LOSS

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:40.848
STATEMENTS. IT'S A START. BUT

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:42.483
THE ONLY REAL WAY TO ENSURE

01:38:42.549 --> 01:38:44.351
COMPLETE ACCOUNTABILITY IS TO

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:47.721
REQUIRE COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY.

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:50.891
NURSING HOMES ARE VERY GOOD AT

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.393
MANIPULATING FINANCIAL DATA.

01:38:52.459 --> 01:38:53.861
FACILITIES HAVE BEEN REQUIRED

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:56.430
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX TO

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:57.865
SUBMIT ANNUAL COST REPORTS. IN

01:38:57.931 --> 01:39:00.367
MY CASES WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:01.869
THE LINE ITEMS ON THESE COST

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:05.673
REPORTS. OPERATIONS CLAIM THAT

01:39:05.739 --> 01:39:07.274
THE REPORTS THAT THEY SUBMITTED

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:10.577
ARE NOW WRONG. WELL WE HAVE

01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:11.879
FOUND IS THAT THEY ARE

01:39:11.945 --> 01:39:15.115
CONSISTENTLY MANIPULATED. IT

01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:17.751
SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT SINCE

01:39:17.818 --> 01:39:18.252
NINETEEN NINETY SIX THIS

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:19.987
INFORMATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:21.989
FREELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC

01:39:22.056 --> 01:39:23.324
AND COULD BE OBTAINED WITH THE

01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:24.625
SIMPLE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:27.061
ACT REQUEST. HOWEVER UNDER OUR

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:28.962
PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AND CMS

01:39:29.029 --> 01:39:30.631
INSTITUTED A POLICY IN WHICH

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.066
THEY REFUSED TO RELEASE THESE

01:39:32.132 --> 01:39:35.035
REPORTS TO THE PUBLIC CLAIMING

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.904
THEY WERE TRADE SECRETS WHY.

01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.339
BECAUSE THE NURSING HOME OWNERS

01:39:38.405 --> 01:39:39.873
HAVE SUBSTANTIAL POLITICAL PULL

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.041
TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION

01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:45.179
PRIVATE AND AGAIN I ASK WHY IF

01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:47.014
THERE IS NOTHING TO HIDE WHY

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:49.383
CHANGE THE PRACTICE THAT HAS

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:49.983
BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER TWENTY

01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:52.419

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COMPANY

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:02.389
DOES NOT GIVE THE NURSING HOME

01:41:02.456 --> 01:41:04.358
THE OPTION OF THEIR YEARS THEY

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:06.260
SIMPLY DICTATE WITHOUT REGARD

01:41:06.326 --> 01:41:07.828

01:41:12.933 --> 01:41:17.070
IN EVERY SINGLE CASE THAT THEY

01:41:17.137 --> 01:41:18.639
DO NOT OPERATE THE BUILDING.

01:41:18.705 --> 01:41:20.174
THESE ENTITIES ARE SIMPLY

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.009
FORMED AS ANOTHER RELATED PARTY

01:41:22.075 --> 01:41:23.777
ENTITY BECAUSE MEDICAID

01:41:23.844 --> 01:41:25.245
REIMBURSEMENT IS BASED ON THE

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:27.448
COST OF SERVICES. SO THE MORE

01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:29.116
MONEY THE NURSING HOME CAN SAY

01:41:29.183 --> 01:41:30.984
IT'S SPENDING EVEN OF GIVING

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:33.821
THE MONEY TO THEMSELVES. AND

01:41:33.887 --> 01:41:34.421
INCREASES THEIR REIMBURSEMENT

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:37.257
RIGHT. THE ONLY TRUE MEASURE TO

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:38.459
DETERMINE OF NURSING HOME

TRANSPARENCY AUDITED

01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:52.306
TRANSPARENCY. THE QUESTION

01:41:52.372 --> 01:41:53.507
SHOULDN'T BE OF A SINGLE

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:55.442
NURSING HOMES PROFITABLE THE

01:41:55.509 --> 01:41:58.479
QUESTION SHOULD BE IF THE CHAIN

01:41:58.545 --> 01:42:00.147
AS A WHOLE IS PROFITABLE. AND

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:01.715
IF THE CHAIN AS A WHOLE IS

01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:03.250
PROFITABLE THE PEOPLE AT THE

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:04.518
TOP OF THAT CHANGE SHOULD BE

01:42:04.585 --> 01:42:06.520
ACCOUNTABLE FOR UNDERSTAFFING

01:42:06.587 --> 01:42:08.889
INDIVIDUAL NURSING HOMES. THIS

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.858
IS WHY WHO OWNS THE NURSING

01:42:10.924 --> 01:42:13.360
HOME MATTERS. WHAT WE NEED FROM

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:15.028
YOU KNOW AS LEGISLATION THAT

01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:17.931
REQUIRES COMPLETE FISCAL

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:19.967
AUDITED TRANSPARENCY.

01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:21.468
LEGISLATION THAT SPECIFICALLY

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:23.036
REQUIRES THE OFFICERS THE

01:42:23.103 --> 01:42:24.872
MANAGERS AND OWNERS OF ANY

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:26.707
NURSING HOME OR CHANGE TO BE

01:42:26.773 --> 01:42:28.509
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND ULTIMATELY

01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:29.943
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE STAFFING

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:31.778
LEVELS IN THOSE BUILDINGS. AT

01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:33.413
PRESENT WE ALLOW THEM TO TAKE

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.848
THE PROFITS OF THESE NURSING

01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:36.717
HOMES BUT WE DO NOT REQUIRE

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:38.652
THEM TO BE ACCOUNTABLE OR EVEN

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.587
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE SINGLE

01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:43.090
MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT

01:42:43.156 --> 01:42:44.591
RELATES TO THE QUALITY OF CARE.

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:46.760
CAPITALISM IS A GOOD THING. BUT

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.095
WE SHOULDN'T BE BREEDING

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:50.297

HAPPENING. IT'S A BREEDING

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:05.445
GROUND FOR BILLIONAIRES BECAUSE

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:05.979

01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:16.316
AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN IN SAN

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:18.118

01:44:26.526 --> 01:44:27.494
CAPACITY I'VE HAD THE

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:28.862
OPPORTUNITY TO WITNESS FIRST

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:30.697
HAND MANY OF THE PROBLEMS ARE

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:32.399
NURSING HOMES AND EXPERIENCE

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:34.801
I'VE ALSO BEEN PERENNIALLY

01:44:34.868 --> 01:44:35.268
AMAZED AT THE LOVE AND

01:44:35.335 --> 01:44:36.937
COMPASSION ARE SHARED BY

01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:38.338
OVERSEEING A STAFF WITH THE

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:39.773
VULNERABLE RESIDENTS UNDER OUR

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.375
CARE AND SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:41.875
GET DISCUSSED IN THESE

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:43.377
MEETINGS. IT'S REALLY

01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:45.145
UNFORTUNATE THAT STAFFING

01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:46.847
ESPECIALLY NURSES AND CNA'S HAS

01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:48.348
BECOME SO MUCH MORE OF A CRISIS

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:50.050
DURING THIS PANDEMIC BUT IT'S

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:51.618
NOT A PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS I

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:52.719
DON'T THINK THERE'S A SIMPLE

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:54.454
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND I

01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:55.822
THINK IT'S NAIVE TO BELIEVE

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:57.024
THAT A FACILITIES ONLY RAISE

01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:59.326
WAGES THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:01.361
SOLVED. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HELP

01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:01.828
WE NEED A MUCH MORE

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:03.130
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO GET

01:45:03.196 --> 01:45:04.631
PEOPLE INTO THE WORKFORCE GET

01:45:04.698 --> 01:45:05.699

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:07.701
KEEP THEM THERE ALL THE TALK

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:09.269
ABOUT HOSPITAL AT HOME AND

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:11.805
SNIFF AT HOME PROGRAMS IS GREAT

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:13.373
BUT WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO NEED

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:15.375
NURSING HOMES. AND I WANNA MAKE

01:45:15.442 --> 01:45:16.843

01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:18.612
OF PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK IN

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:20.180
POST ACUTE AND LONG TERM CARE

01:45:20.247 --> 01:45:21.782
NOT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:23.016

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:24.785

HOSPITALIZATION. SO THAT

01:46:02.155 --> 01:46:03.757
COMPLICATES THINGS A LITTLE BIT

01:46:03.824 --> 01:46:05.492
THAT LATTER POPULATION IS OFTEN

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:07.394

TO BE SEEN BY THEIR DOCTOR DAY.

01:46:36.656 --> 01:46:37.791
NURSING HOMES HAVE NOTHING OF

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.826
THE SORT LIKE THOSE SAFEGUARDS

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:41.294
THE DOCTOR ONLY HAS TO SEE THE

01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:43.130
PATIENT ONCE EVERY THIRTY DAYS.

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:44.731
THERE'S ZERO REQUIREMENT FOR

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:46.399
CREDENTIALING AND PRIVILEGING

01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:47.934
THE FACILITY HAS TO EVACUATE

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:49.336
COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDES THE

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:50.737
MEDICAL DIRECTOR BUT THERE'S NO

01:46:50.804 --> 01:46:52.305
REQUIREMENT FOR SPECIFIC

01:46:52.372 --> 01:46:53.840
MONITORING OR AUDITING OF OTHER

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:55.542
PHYSICIANS PERFORMANCE. AND

THOSE Q. A MEETINGS DON'T HAVE

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:58.011
TO OCCUR ANYMORE THAT ONCE A

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:00.080
QUARTER. THE MEDICAL DIRECTORS

01:47:00.147 --> 01:47:01.648
REALLY THE ONLY MECHANISM FOR

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:03.450
ASSESSING PHYSICIAN PERFORMANCE

01:47:03.517 --> 01:47:04.684
AND THE ACTUAL MEDICAL CARE IN

01:47:04.751 --> 01:47:05.952
THE BUILDING. YET THE AVERAGE

01:47:06.019 --> 01:47:07.721
MEDICAL DIRECTOR POSITION CALLS

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:09.589
FOR ONLY A FEW HOURS A MONTH.

01:47:09.656 --> 01:47:11.658
WHAT'S MORE SHOCKING THOUGH IS

01:47:11.725 --> 01:47:12.959
THAT THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT AT

01:47:13.026 --> 01:47:14.361

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:15.862

SO SOME FACILITIES HIRE RETIRED

01:47:19.499 --> 01:47:21.234
PEDIATRICIANS ARE SURGEONS WHO

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.903
HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF GERIATRICS

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:25.105
OR OF THE COMPLEX REGULATORY

01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:26.106
FRAMEWORK THAT NURSING HOMES

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:27.774

EMISSIONS AND FILL THE BEDS.

01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:33.680
CLEARLY THIS CREATES A HIGHER

01:47:33.747 --> 01:47:35.916
RISK OF QUALITY LAPSES AND WE

01:47:35.982 --> 01:47:37.651

RESIDENT PROTECTIVE NURSING

01:50:08.034 --> 01:50:09.869
HOME POLICIES IN THE COUNTRY.

01:50:09.936 --> 01:50:12.038
THE ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN AND

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:14.140
REMAINS TOTALLY MORE ABOUND.

01:50:14.207 --> 01:50:15.809
THE REPORTS BILLS IN HEARINGS

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:17.978
TYPICALLY CALL OUT CDPH

01:50:18.044 --> 01:50:18.645
FAILURES GOING BACK FORTY

01:50:18.712 --> 01:50:21.181
YEARS. BUT IT'S PERFORMANCE

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:23.249
NEVER REALLY IMPROVES. THERE

01:50:23.316 --> 01:50:24.217
ARE THREE FACTS THAT I THINK

01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:25.585
ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:26.152
LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC TO

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:30.390
KNOW. ONE DPH HAS NO CONTROL

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:32.726
OVER NURSING HOME QUALITY. DPH

01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:34.260
IS LACK OF CONTROL IS MOST

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:35.328
PROFOUND ON THE ISSUE OF

01:50:35.395 --> 01:50:37.430
NURSING HOME OWNERSHIP. I KNOW

01:50:37.497 --> 01:50:38.231
IT'S ALREADY BEEN COVERED A

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:39.733
LITTLE BIT BUT- THIS IS WHAT I

01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:42.869
GAP. IT SYSTEM FOR APPROVING A

01:50:42.936 --> 01:50:44.337
LICENSING THE PEOPLE WHO OWN

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:46.206
AND OPERATE NURSING HOMES IS

01:50:46.272 --> 01:50:49.075
STRAIGHT BANANAS. CORROSIVE DPH

01:50:49.142 --> 01:50:51.644
INACTION HAS CREATED A SYSTEM

01:50:51.711 --> 01:50:52.245
WHERE OPERATORS WITH TERRIBLE

01:50:52.312 --> 01:50:54.948
TRACK WORKERS TRUCK TRACK

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:55.548
RECORDS TAKEOVER NURSING HOMES

01:50:55.615 --> 01:50:58.918
WITHOUT APPROVAL. WHAT'S WORSE

01:50:58.985 --> 01:50:59.552
WHEN THE STATE ACTUALLY DENIES

01:50:59.619 --> 01:51:01.021
A LICENSE IT DOESN'T REALLY

01:51:01.087 --> 01:51:04.157
MATTER. THE UNFIT OPERATOR CAN

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:06.159
JUST KEEP OPERATING VARIOUS

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:08.228
NURSING HOME SLUMLORDS OPERATE

01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:09.496
WITHOUT THE FAINTEST CONCERNED

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:10.864
THAT EVEN THE MOST SHOCKING

01:51:10.930 --> 01:51:12.932
CASES OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. ARE

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:13.500
GOING TO AFFECT THEIR BOTTOM

01:51:13.566 --> 01:51:16.236
LINES. HERE IS HOW CALIFORNIA'S

01:51:16.302 --> 01:51:18.471
LUDICROUSLY DISORDERED

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:21.041
LICENSING SYSTEM WORKS. ONE

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:24.077
TAKEOVER NURSING HOME TO APPLY

01:51:24.144 --> 01:51:25.211
FOR A LICENSE AFTER YOU'VE

01:51:25.278 --> 01:51:27.714
TAKEN OVER WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:30.784
IT OR MAYBE DON'T. THREE TAKE

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:32.552
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:34.054
TAXPAYER REVENUE FOR YEARS

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:37.390
WITHOUT A LICENSE. FOUR IF DPH

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:38.491
EVENTUALLY TURNED YOU DOWN

01:51:38.558 --> 01:51:42.562
APPEAL. OR MAYBE DON'T. IF YOU

01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:44.664
APPEAL WAIT UNTIL THE EVE OF

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:46.666
THE HEARING AND WITHDRAW YOUR

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:50.703
APPEAL AND REAPPLY. SIX REPEAT

01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:53.073
THIS CYCLE ADD INFINITUM. I

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:55.942
TOOK LATIN IN HIGH SCHOOL. MUCH

01:51:56.009 --> 01:51:57.444
OF THIS INANE PROCESS WAS

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:58.978
HIGHLIGHTED IN TO NEWTON TO

01:51:59.045 --> 01:52:00.580
RECENT NEWS STORIES FROM

01:52:00.647 --> 01:52:03.683
CALMATTERS AND L. A. S.

01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:04.751
OPERATING WITHOUT STATE

01:52:04.818 --> 01:52:06.052
APPROVAL WHAT WE CALL NURSING

01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:07.587
HOME SQUATTING IS NOT JUST A

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:09.155
VIOLATION OF OUR STATE POLICY

01:52:09.222 --> 01:52:11.391
IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY NORMS. IT

01:52:11.458 --> 01:52:13.426
INVITES SUFFERING AND DEATH.

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:15.295
FACILITIES RUN BY SQUATTERS ARE

01:52:15.361 --> 01:52:16.129
AMONG THE WORST NURSING HOMES

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:18.832
IN THE STATE. SQUATTERS HAVE

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:19.966
24% LESS REGISTERED NURSE

01:52:20.033 --> 01:52:22.135
STAFFING. MORE STAFF TURNOVER

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:23.937
MORE STATE ISSUE DEFICIENCIES

01:52:24.003 --> 01:52:26.106
AND LOWER STAR RATINGS. AND

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:28.007
SQUATTERS TAKE CARE MORE PEOPLE

01:52:28.074 --> 01:52:30.510
WHO ARE POOR AND OF COLOR. THE

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:32.245
CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP FARCE IS

01:52:32.312 --> 01:52:34.080
BEST ILLUSTRATED BY ANALOGY.

01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:36.649
LET'S SAY ON MY WAY HERE I SOLD

01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:38.685
MY DRIVER'S LICENSE TO A PERSON

01:52:38.751 --> 01:52:39.452
WHO HAS A HORRIBLE HISTORY OF

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:42.655
BAD DRIVING. AND THE DMV HAS NO

01:52:42.722 --> 01:52:44.557
SAY. THAT WOULD BE TROUBLING.

01:52:44.624 --> 01:52:46.059
NOW IMAGINE MY LICENSE WAS A

01:52:46.126 --> 01:52:48.094
COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE AND

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:50.130
I SOLD IT TO A PERSON WHO

01:52:50.196 --> 01:52:50.697
DRIVES A BUS FULL OF SCHOOL

01:52:50.763 --> 01:52:52.665
KIDS EVERY DAY. THAT'S WHAT

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:54.567
WE'VE DONE IN CALIFORNIA. WE

01:52:54.634 --> 01:52:56.636
ALLOW LICENSEES TO SELL OR

01:52:56.703 --> 01:52:58.371
OUTSOURCE THEIR LICENSES.

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.073
UNIMPEDED TO FOLKS WITH VERY

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.909
BAD TRACK RECORDS. AND THEN WE

01:53:02.976 --> 01:53:03.476
PAY THEM TENS OF MILLIONS OF

01:53:03.543 --> 01:53:05.545
DOLLARS TO DO IT. THERE IS

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:06.846
NOTHING MORE FOUNDATIONAL TO

01:53:06.913 --> 01:53:08.314
NURSING HOMES AND WHO OWNS AND

01:53:08.381 --> 01:53:09.816
OPERATES THEM AND THIS ON THIS

01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:12.519
MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN. DPH

01:53:12.585 --> 01:53:15.188
JUST TOTALLY FAILS TO GOVERN.

01:53:15.255 --> 01:53:16.389
THE SECOND IMPORTANT FACTOR

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:17.423
KNOW ABOUT NURSING HOMES IS

01:53:17.490 --> 01:53:18.691
THAT THE MAJORITY THE VAST

01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:20.760
MAJORITY. ARE FOR PROFIT

01:53:20.827 --> 01:53:21.694
NURSING HOMES RUN BY FINANCE

01:53:21.761 --> 01:53:23.730
PEOPLE. THESE FOLKS COULD CARE

01:53:23.796 --> 01:53:25.598
LESS ABOUT NURSING OR RESIDENTS

01:53:25.665 --> 01:53:27.133
OR QUALITY OF CARE EXCEPT AS IT

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.435
RELATES TO MONEY. THE PEOPLE AT

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:30.570
THE CORPORATE LEADERSHIP LEVELS

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:32.805
ARE LIKE MACHINES. PROGRAM TO

01:53:32.872 --> 01:53:34.908
FIND THE INCENTIVES AND WEAK

01:53:34.974 --> 01:53:35.508
POINTS IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:37.777
EXPLOIT THEM. THERE ARE MYRIAD

01:53:37.844 --> 01:53:39.312
INCENTIVES AND WEAK POINTS TO

01:53:39.379 --> 01:53:40.613
EXPLOIT MOST OF WHICH HAVE

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.415
LITTLE TO DO WITH GOOD CARE.

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:44.817
DPH HAS BEEN NO MATCH FOR THESE

01:53:44.884 --> 01:53:47.353
PROFIT MAXIMIZING MACHINES. THE

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:48.388
LAST IMPORTANT FACTOR KNOWS

01:53:48.454 --> 01:53:49.856
THAT THERE ARE EPIDEMIC LEVELS

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:51.457
OF ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT

01:53:51.524 --> 01:53:52.292
OCCURRING CALIFORNIA NURSING

01:53:52.358 --> 01:53:54.594
HOMES. WEAK ENFORCEMENT ENABLES

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:57.230
BAD CARE AND DPH ENFORCEMENT IS

01:53:57.297 --> 01:53:59.566
EXTRAORDINARILY WEAK. DPH

01:53:59.632 --> 01:54:01.267
STREET STANDARDS OF CARE AS

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:01.801
GOALS RATHER THAN ACTUAL

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:04.170
REQUIREMENTS. IN THE PAST THREE

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:09.676
YEARS 97% THREE YEARS. OF THE

01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:10.276
THIRTY THREE THOUSAND FEDERAL

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:10.843
DEFICIENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:12.245
ISSUED AGAINST CALIFORNIA

01:54:12.312 --> 01:54:13.112
NURSING HOMES INCLUDING STUFF

01:54:13.179 --> 01:54:15.615
LIKE. THE ASSAULTS CHEMICAL

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:17.684
RESTRAINTS ILLEGAL EVICTIONS

01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:19.285
FALLS BED SORES CHOKING.

01:54:19.352 --> 01:54:20.453
CHRONIC UNDERSTAFFING YOU NAME

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:24.257
IT. 97% OF THESE THIRTY

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:24.891
THOUSAND WERE FOUND TO BE QUOTE

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:26.693
NON HARMFUL. THIS WARPED SENSE

01:54:26.759 --> 01:54:28.261
OF RESIDENT INJURY LOS

01:54:28.328 --> 01:54:29.295
DEMONSTRATES A NURSING HOMES

01:54:29.362 --> 01:54:30.663
RATHER THAN THE RESIDENTS ARE

01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:32.565
THE CONSTITUENCY WHOSE

01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:34.801
INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED BY CDPH.

01:54:34.867 --> 01:54:35.969
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION BECAUSE

01:54:36.035 --> 01:54:36.603
THIS CAME UP IN THE AUDITOR'S

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:38.738
REPORT- IN TERMS OF

01:54:38.805 --> 01:54:40.106
RECERTIFICATION AS I WENT ON

01:54:40.173 --> 01:54:41.574
THE ON THE DPH WEBSITE AND I

01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:45.411
FOUND IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

01:54:45.478 --> 01:54:45.979
TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO FIND

01:54:46.045 --> 01:54:47.480
IT. THE FINANCIAL YEAR. THERE

01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:49.716
WAS ONE. RECERTIFICATION AND

01:54:49.782 --> 01:54:50.917
OVER TWELVE HUNDRED NURSING

01:54:50.984 --> 01:54:53.086
HOMES IN THE WHOLE YEAR. ONE

01:54:53.152 --> 01:54:55.888
STATE RECERTIFICATION SURVEY.

01:54:55.955 --> 01:54:57.090
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE

LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION HAS

01:54:58.324 --> 01:54:59.792
GOES BACK TO THE EIGHTIES

01:54:59.859 --> 01:55:01.661
EXAMINE DPH AND CONCLUDED

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:04.063
QUOTE. IT DOES NOT HAVE A WHOLE

HEARTED COMMITMENT TO

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:07.233
ENFORCEMENT OF ITS OWN

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:09.702
REGULATIONS. AND QUOTE. THAT IS

01:55:09.769 --> 01:55:13.273
IT PRECISELY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:55:13.339 --> 01:55:15.008
NINE AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

01:55:15.074 --> 01:55:16.342
REAL ENFORCEMENT REQUIRES A

01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:17.543
WHOLE HEARTED COMMITMENT TO THE

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.679
WELFARE OF RESIDENTS THEIR

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:22.248
MISTREATMENT ISOLATION AND PAIN

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:24.017
MUST BE VIEWED AS EMBARRASSING

01:55:24.083 --> 01:55:26.019
FAILURES. IT MUST BE HANDED.

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.120
BUT INSTEAD OF EMPATHY AND

01:55:27.186 --> 01:55:29.355
COMMITMENT AND RESOLUTION DPH

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:31.190
REMAINS HALF HEARTED AND

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:32.125
COMPLETELY IMPERVIOUS TO

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:33.793
CRITICISM. THE DEPARTMENT

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:35.528
WEATHER'S ALL CUT DEPARTMENT

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:37.230
WEATHER'S HEARINGS LIKE THIS

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:41.668
NEWS REPORTS LITIGATION. AND

01:55:41.734 --> 01:55:42.268
OTHER KINDS OF THINGS NONE OF

01:55:42.335 --> 01:55:45.138
IT MATTERS. DPH LEADERS HAVE ON

01:55:45.204 --> 01:55:46.172
ROLL THE WELCOME MA FOR BED

01:55:46.239 --> 01:55:47.740
NURSING HOME OPERATORS AND

01:55:47.807 --> 01:55:48.474
TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THE

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:50.376
RESIDENTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS

01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:52.512
APPLICATION CALIFORNIA NURSING

01:55:52.578 --> 01:55:53.846
HOMES ARE DOMINATED BY FOR

01:55:53.913 --> 01:55:55.948
PROFIT CHAINS THAT AT BEST ARE

01:55:56.015 --> 01:55:57.050
KNOWN FOR PUTTING PROFITS OVER

01:55:57.116 --> 01:56:00.219
CARE AND IT WORSE FOR ROUTINELY

01:56:00.286 --> 01:56:00.853
EXPOSING RESIDENTS TO ABUSE AND

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:03.256
NEGLECT. ARE GOOD RULES MEANT

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:04.557
TO MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY OF LIFE

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:05.391
FOR RESIDENTS ARE ROUTINELY

01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:06.793
VIOLATED BECAUSE THERE ARE SO

01:56:06.859 --> 01:56:09.095
FEW CONSEQUENCES. HOW CAN YOU

01:56:09.162 --> 01:56:11.364
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WELL AB

01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:12.165
FIFTEEN OH TWO WOULD BE A VERY

01:56:12.231 --> 01:56:14.667
GOOD START. AB FIFTEEN OH TWO

01:56:14.734 --> 01:56:15.201
WOULD RAMP UP THE STATE'S

01:56:15.268 --> 01:56:16.369
SUITABILITY STANDARDS FOR

01:56:16.436 --> 01:56:17.770

ZOMBIE NURSING HOME LICENSING

SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AB

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:22.742
FIFTEEN OH TWO WOULD FORCE DPH

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:24.110
BACK INTO ITS ROLE AS A

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:25.878
LICENSING AGENCY. AND A

01:56:25.945 --> 01:56:28.715
CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY. AND

01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:29.816
LET THE BAD OPERATORS KNOW THAT

01:56:29.882 --> 01:56:31.617
CALIFORNIA IS NO LONGER OPEN

01:56:31.684 --> 01:56:33.519
FOR THEIR KIND OF BUSINESS. I

01:56:33.586 --> 01:56:34.754
WOULD LIKE TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:36.789
MY DEEP APPRECIATION. TO MEMBER

01:56:36.856 --> 01:56:38.858

THINGS THAT YOU THINK ARE THE

02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:36.868
MOST URGENT. SO I THINK ONE OF

02:14:36.935 --> 02:14:37.769
THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HIGHLY

02:14:37.836 --> 02:14:39.905

02:14:39.971 --> 02:14:45.177
APPLICATION OF THE REGULATIONS-

02:14:45.243 --> 02:14:46.778
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING AND

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:48.480
QUITE FRANKLY THAT DOESN'T

02:14:48.547 --> 02:14:50.816
OCCUR I'M I WAS I KNOW WE WHAT

02:14:50.882 --> 02:14:53.018
WE BALLING DRASTIC HERE TODAY

02:14:53.084 --> 02:14:55.454
I'M THE APPLICATION OF A

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:57.155
PARTICULAR REGULATORY VIOLATION

02:14:57.222 --> 02:14:58.890
AND ONE FACILITY VERSUS ANOTHER

02:14:58.957 --> 02:15:00.058
FACILITY THE OUTCOMES ARE

02:15:00.125 --> 02:15:03.862
INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT. I'M AND I

02:15:03.929 --> 02:15:07.432
MEAN QUITE FRANKLY. I NEVER

02:15:07.499 --> 02:15:08.800
MENTIONING THAT BEFORE WE CAME

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:11.069
IN TODAY THOUGHT WHEN YOU LOOK

02:15:11.136 --> 02:15:14.306
AT THE HISTORY OF HOW THE-

02:15:14.372 --> 02:15:15.874
SADLY HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:18.076
PUBLIC HEALTH HAS NOT STOPPED

02:15:18.143 --> 02:15:21.346
UP I AND HOW THEIR HISTORY JUST

02:15:21.413 --> 02:15:23.648
CONTINUES TO REPEAT ITSELF IT'S

02:15:23.715 --> 02:15:26.084
NO WONDER. THAT THE FACILITY

02:15:26.151 --> 02:15:28.620
OWNERS AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:32.524
GAME NOT SYSTEM. AND BEER AS I

02:15:32.591 --> 02:15:36.428
MENTIONED AND MY REMARKS- WHEN

02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:37.829
I FIRST STARTED DOING ELDER

02:15:37.896 --> 02:15:39.764
ABUSE LITIGATION THERE WERE

02:15:39.831 --> 02:15:42.200
QUITE A NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES

02:15:42.267 --> 02:15:43.668
AND QUIET A NUMBER OF

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:47.472
CITATIONS. AND IT WAS WEDNESDAY

02:15:47.539 --> 02:15:49.875
WHEN SOMEONE DIED IN A NURSING

02:15:49.941 --> 02:15:52.711
HOME THERE SEEM TO BE AN ACTUAL

02:15:52.777 --> 02:15:56.047
REVIEW OR TO TRY AND DETERMINE

02:15:56.114 --> 02:15:56.648
IF THOUGHT DEATH WAS ACTUALLY

02:15:56.715 --> 02:15:58.750
RELATED. WHERE I WAS NOW WHAT I

02:15:58.817 --> 02:16:01.653
SAW THERE WAS THIS PROGRESSION

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.788
AND WHAT I SAW WAS THIS VERY

02:16:03.855 --> 02:16:07.325
SHARP DROP OFF. WHERE WE WENT

02:16:07.392 --> 02:16:09.394
FROM CITING NURSING HOMES.

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:12.764
CLASSE DOUBLE A. CITATIONS WE

02:16:12.831 --> 02:16:15.000
STOP DOING NOT AND WHAT

02:16:15.066 --> 02:16:17.302
HAPPENED WAS THEY JUST BECAME

02:16:17.369 --> 02:16:19.304
SUB STANDARD DEFICIENCY SO THEY

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:20.238
WERE THERE'S A SCOPE AND

02:16:20.305 --> 02:16:21.840
SEVERITY FOR EACH OF THE

02:16:21.907 --> 02:16:23.875
DEFICIENCIES AND THAT AND THEY

02:16:23.942 --> 02:16:25.310
BECAME A SUB STANDARD

02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:26.745
DEFICIENCY WHICH WAS PERHAPS A

02:16:26.811 --> 02:16:29.881
G. SUCH A DEFICIENCY BUT NO

02:16:29.948 --> 02:16:32.217
LONGER WEAR THOSE DEFICIENCIES-

02:16:32.284 --> 02:16:34.052
RISING TO THE LEVEL THAT THEY

02:16:34.119 --> 02:16:37.622
WERE CLASS A. R. W. CITATION. I

02:16:37.689 --> 02:16:38.924
ONLY KNOW MY LITTLE WORLD OF

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:40.725
WHAT I DO ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS

02:16:40.792 --> 02:16:42.694
WHAT I'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST

02:16:42.761 --> 02:16:44.062
TWENTY THREE YEARS. BUT IT WAS

02:16:44.129 --> 02:16:45.864
VERY VERY VERY OBVIOUS TO ME

02:16:45.931 --> 02:16:48.633
THERE ARE STILL IT'S LIKE.

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:50.769
BLACK AND WHITE WHAT IS NOW A

02:16:50.835 --> 02:16:53.638
G. DEFICIENCY USED TO BE AN

02:16:53.705 --> 02:16:55.307
ESSAY OR A DOUBLE A CITATION.

02:16:55.373 --> 02:16:57.008
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

02:16:57.075 --> 02:16:59.344
IN THAT PROCESS I FEEL LIKE

02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:01.680
THERE NEEDS TO BE. AS A CIVIL

02:17:01.746 --> 02:17:03.148
LITIGATOR WHAT I FIND IS THAT

02:17:03.214 --> 02:17:04.583
PEOPLE ONLY SEEM TO CARE WHEN

02:17:04.649 --> 02:17:06.318
YOU HIT THEM AND THE ONE THING

02:17:06.384 --> 02:17:07.986
THEY CARE ABOUT WHICH IS MONEY.

02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:10.488
AND THAT'S A VERY SAD. STATE OF

02:17:10.555 --> 02:17:12.324
AFFAIRS BUT IT IS THE REALITY.

02:17:12.390 --> 02:17:14.793
SAYS CITING THE FOR DEFINING

02:17:14.859 --> 02:17:16.428
THESE FACILITIES DEFICIENT AND

02:17:16.494 --> 02:17:17.562
SITTING GIVING THEM ALL OF THE

02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:18.930
STATEMENTS OF DEFICIENCIES THEY

02:17:18.997 --> 02:17:20.298
DON'T EVEN THEY DON'T EVEN CARE

02:17:20.365 --> 02:17:21.333
AND QUITE HONESTLY ALL THEY

02:17:21.399 --> 02:17:23.401
TELL ME. WHEN I ASK THEM ABOUT

02:17:23.468 --> 02:17:25.203
THESE REPEAT DEFICIENCIES WHERE

02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:26.705
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR THEY

02:17:26.771 --> 02:17:27.639
JUST KEEP GETTING CITED FOR THE

02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:29.808
SAME THING. ALL THEY TELL ME IS

02:17:29.874 --> 02:17:30.976
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

02:17:31.042 --> 02:17:32.577
HEALTH. QUITE FRANKLY DOESN'T

02:17:32.644 --> 02:17:33.712
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I'M

02:17:33.778 --> 02:17:35.080
NOT THE WHOLE PROCESS DOESN'T

02:17:35.146 --> 02:17:36.381
REALLY WORK AND THAT THEY DON'T

02:17:36.448 --> 02:17:37.916
REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE

02:17:37.983 --> 02:17:38.650
STATEMENTS OF DEFICIENCIES

02:17:38.717 --> 02:17:40.852
ANYWAY. AND THEY LITERALLY JUST

02:17:40.919 --> 02:17:42.454
BALK AT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND

02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:44.289
PAY IT NO NEVER MIND. NOW WHAT

02:17:44.356 --> 02:17:46.124
THEY WOULD CARE ABOUT IS IF THE

02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:48.426
STATE ONE IN AND LEVY A FINE

02:17:48.493 --> 02:17:50.595
AGAINST THEM. AND IF IT'S NOT

02:17:50.662 --> 02:17:52.030
ACTIVE THOUGHT PROCESS ACTUALLY

02:17:52.097 --> 02:17:54.766
WORK I THINK THAT THEN AT LEAST

02:17:54.833 --> 02:17:56.701
IT MIGHT CAUSE THEM TO HOP SOME

02:17:56.768 --> 02:18:00.071
LEVEL OF POLISH. SO I WHATEVER

02:18:00.138 --> 02:18:01.740
WE WERE DOING BEFORE WHERE WE

02:18:01.806 --> 02:18:04.476
WERE ISSUING MONEY- CITATION.

02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:08.213
NEEDS. TO BE RE IMPLEMENTED IF

02:18:08.279 --> 02:18:09.481
YOU WERE TO ASK ME. YOU CAN

02:18:09.547 --> 02:18:11.816
TELL CAN ZURCHER. I MEAN COMMON

02:18:11.883 --> 02:18:16.488
THE- YES I'D BE DELIGHTED TO-

02:18:16.554 --> 02:18:18.223
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:19.591
PROBLEM WITH THIS BECAUSE IT'S

02:18:19.658 --> 02:18:20.125
IT BRINGS IN A LOT OF THE

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:21.926
FEDERAL RULES AND LAWS BUT I

02:18:21.993 --> 02:18:23.261
THINK ONE THING WE COULD DO

02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:25.664
RIGHT AWAY IS TO. CHANGE THE

02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:27.732
PRESUMPTION FROM NO HARM ON A

02:18:27.799 --> 02:18:29.634
LOT OF THESE DEFICIENCIES AND

02:18:29.701 --> 02:18:30.201
CITATIONS TO A RESUMPTION OF

02:18:30.268 --> 02:18:32.804
HARM- ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES LIKE

02:18:32.871 --> 02:18:34.873
CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS- WHICH WE

02:18:34.939 --> 02:18:36.908
SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. IF

02:18:36.975 --> 02:18:37.976
YOU'RE TAKING AN INAPPROPRIATE

02:18:38.043 --> 02:18:39.244
MEDICATION THAT CHANGES THE WAY

02:18:39.310 --> 02:18:40.578
YOUR MIND WORKS AND IT'S AN

02:18:40.645 --> 02:18:41.780
APPROPRIATE I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:43.782
DE FACTO HARMFUL AND IN THE

02:18:43.848 --> 02:18:44.416
DEPARTMENT NEVER TREATS THINGS

02:18:44.482 --> 02:18:47.585
THIS WAY- SO THAT'S WHAT NUMBER

02:18:47.652 --> 02:18:48.186
ONE NUMBER TWO I THINK THAT'S

02:18:48.253 --> 02:18:49.621
REALLY IMPORTANT IS. THAT YOU

02:18:49.688 --> 02:18:52.490
KNOW. MY STRONGEST FEELINGS IS

02:18:52.557 --> 02:18:55.427
THAT. THE BEST ENFORCEMENT

02:18:55.493 --> 02:18:56.461
GONNA COME FROM THE CONSUMERS

02:18:56.528 --> 02:18:58.430
THEMSELVES IF THEY'RE IN POWER

02:18:58.496 --> 02:19:00.598
TO DO THAT AND ASSEMBLY BILL

02:19:00.665 --> 02:19:01.533
EIGHT FORTY NINE WHICH-

02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:03.268
REINVIGORATED HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:19:03.334 --> 02:19:05.036
CODE FOURTEEN THIRTY B. IS A

02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:07.105
GREAT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION

02:19:07.172 --> 02:19:08.873
BUT GIVING CONSUMERS THE

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.408
ABILITY TO SELF AND FORCE A LOT

02:19:10.475 --> 02:19:11.209
OF THESE REGULATORY

02:19:11.276 --> 02:19:12.410
REQUIREMENTS I THINK IS THAT

02:19:12.477 --> 02:19:14.579
WOULD BE IT WOULD BE AWESOME-

02:19:14.646 --> 02:19:16.481
AND GIVING. THEIR CONSUMERS

02:19:16.548 --> 02:19:18.249
MORE CONTROL OVER HOW THEIR

02:19:18.316 --> 02:19:19.851
MONEY IS SPENT IF THEY HAVE A

02:19:19.918 --> 02:19:21.753
GREAT EXPERIENCE THEY THEY PAY

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.588
MORE MORE MONEY IS A LOT OF SO

02:19:23.655 --> 02:19:24.923
EVEN IF THEY HAVE A BAD

02:19:24.989 --> 02:19:27.058
EXPERIENCE. AND THEN. WE REALLY

02:19:27.125 --> 02:19:28.393
NEED TO END THIS IS WHAT I CALL

03:05:55.544 --> 03:05:57.212
THE BLUE SHADES ARE ACTUALLY.

03:05:57.279 --> 03:05:59.047
UP DIVISIONS WITHIN THE

03:05:59.114 --> 03:06:00.148
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

03:06:00.215 --> 03:06:01.650

DH CS THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH

03:06:18.267 --> 03:06:20.502
CARE SERVICES. EACH LINE SHOWS

03:06:20.569 --> 03:06:22.304
YOU JUST HOW COMPLICATED THIS

03:06:22.371 --> 03:06:24.306
IS BETWEEN THE LICENSING. AND

03:06:24.373 --> 03:06:26.808

AND THE MEDIC HEALTH

03:06:27.309 --> 03:06:28.544
CERTIFICATION. THERE ARE SO

03:06:28.610 --> 03:06:30.445
MANY ISSUES IN THIS PROCESS

03:06:30.512 --> 03:06:32.814
RIGHT NOW- THAT THAT THAT

03:06:32.881 --> 03:06:34.416
REALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND

03:06:34.483 --> 03:06:35.951
WE TOTALLY AGREE THAT THERE

03:06:36.018 --> 03:06:37.419
NEEDS TO BE A LOOK AT THIS

03:06:37.486 --> 03:06:39.588
LENGTHY AND CONVOLUTED PROCESS

03:06:39.655 --> 03:06:40.622
FOR CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PUBLIC

03:06:40.689 --> 03:06:42.624
APPLICATIONS. WE ARE HOWEVER

03:06:42.691 --> 03:06:43.992
OPPOSED TO EIGHT TWO MISTER

03:06:44.059 --> 03:06:45.861
MAYOR CITIES BILL AS CURRENTLY

03:06:45.928 --> 03:06:47.796
WRITTEN. BECAUSE WE THINK IT

03:06:47.863 --> 03:06:49.431
PROPOSES AN OVERARCHING AND

03:06:49.498 --> 03:06:51.567
PUNITIVE APPROACH THE PROCESS

03:06:51.633 --> 03:06:53.035
RATHER THAN ADDRESSING THE

03:06:53.101 --> 03:06:53.835
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THE

03:06:53.902 --> 03:06:56.104
PROCESS. AS LONG AS THE LENGTH

03:06:56.171 --> 03:06:57.506
OF TIME FOR IT THE OWNERSHIP

03:06:57.573 --> 03:06:59.308
TAKES YEARS AND YOU'VE HEARD

03:06:59.374 --> 03:07:02.377
SOME OF THIS. IT'S CRITICAL

03:07:02.444 --> 03:07:02.911
THAT THEY HAD SOME SORT OF

03:07:02.978 --> 03:07:04.012
INTIMATE INNER A MANAGEMENT

03:07:04.079 --> 03:07:06.315
AGREEMENT BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE

03:07:06.381 --> 03:07:07.149
WHILE THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE

03:07:07.215 --> 03:07:08.750
PENDING IF THE APPLICATIONS

03:07:08.817 --> 03:07:09.751
COULD BE PROCESSED IN A

03:07:09.818 --> 03:07:11.286
REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME I

03:07:11.353 --> 03:07:13.722
DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE IN THE

03:07:13.789 --> 03:07:15.090
SITUATION- NOTHING PENALTIES

03:07:15.157 --> 03:07:16.959
FINES AND BAN ON ADMISSIONS FOR

03:07:17.025 --> 03:07:18.393
FACILITIES. THAT HAVE TO

03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:20.228
UTILIZE IN OUR MANAGERS JUST

03:07:20.295 --> 03:07:22.965
GOES TOO FAR- I WANT ALSO POINT

03:07:23.031 --> 03:07:24.366
OUT THE LAST ROW I DON'T THINK

03:07:24.433 --> 03:07:25.701
YOU CAN SEE IT ON YOUR GRAPHIC

03:07:25.767 --> 03:07:26.735
BUT YOU'VE GOT A HARD COPY I

03:07:26.802 --> 03:07:28.704
BELIEVE- THERE'S PROCESS

03:07:28.770 --> 03:07:30.405
CHANGES THAT WE THINK. CAN BE

03:07:30.472 --> 03:07:32.040
MADE HERE THAT WE THINK WOULD

03:07:32.107 --> 03:07:34.076
ACTUALLY. GET VERY MUCH OF SOME

03:07:34.142 --> 03:07:36.011

03:07:36.078 --> 03:07:37.613
MORE STREAMLINED APPLICATION

03:07:37.679 --> 03:07:38.981

HISTORY OF CITATIONS IT'S

03:07:56.565 --> 03:07:58.567
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT SCALE. A

03:07:58.634 --> 03:08:00.636
COMPANY THAT OPERATES FIVE OR

03:08:00.702 --> 03:08:02.638
LESS FACILITIES SHOULD NOT HAVE

03:08:02.704 --> 03:08:04.973
THE SAME CRITERIA AS A FIX AS A

03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:06.008

03:08:09.378 --> 03:08:10.646
HIS AND THAT THAT HAS A HISTORY

03:08:10.712 --> 03:08:12.080

03:08:19.021 --> 03:08:20.789
BELIEVE CD PH SHOULD CONSIDER A

03:08:20.856 --> 03:08:22.724
FAST TRACK PROCESS. FOR

03:08:22.791 --> 03:08:24.126
COMPANIES THAT APPLIED FOR A

03:08:24.192 --> 03:08:25.927
CHANGE IN THE LAST YEAR HAVE

03:08:25.994 --> 03:08:27.796
BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. THEY

03:08:27.863 --> 03:08:29.831
START OVER ALL OVER WITH EACH

03:08:29.898 --> 03:08:31.833
OF THESE APPLICATIONS. THE

03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:33.301
DEPARTMENT ALREADY HAS ALL THAT

03:08:33.368 --> 03:08:34.836
INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE

03:08:34.903 --> 03:08:36.838
PARTICULAR COMPANY. AND SHOULD

03:08:36.905 --> 03:08:38.840
BE ABLE TO REVIEW MORE QUICKLY.

03:08:38.907 --> 03:08:39.808
FOR THOSE BUILDINGS IN

03:08:39.875 --> 03:08:41.209
FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR

03:08:41.276 --> 03:08:42.477
EXPERIENCING OTHER IMMEDIATE

03:08:42.544 --> 03:08:45.981
REGULATORY ISSUES. A FAST TRACK.

03:08:46.048 --> 03:08:47.249
PROCESS QUé SHOULD BE

03:08:47.315 --> 03:08:49.084
UTILIZED. WHICH WOULD BE IN THE

03:08:49.151 --> 03:08:50.218
BEST INTEREST OF THE RESIDENTS

03:08:50.285 --> 03:08:52.821

EVERYONE THE HERE'S THIS TO.

03:08:59.361 --> 03:09:00.929
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR A FACILITY

03:09:00.996 --> 03:09:02.164
TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A NEW

03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:04.232
META CAL RATE YOUR RATES ARE

03:09:04.299 --> 03:09:08.437
BASED ON FEE. FOR SERVICE AND

03:09:08.503 --> 03:09:09.037
YOU CAN'T ESTABLISH A NEW RATE

03:09:09.104 --> 03:09:09.671
EVEN THE FIRST THAT PUTTING IN

03:09:09.738 --> 03:09:10.839
MORE MONEY IT WANTS TO SPEND

03:09:10.906 --> 03:09:12.407
MORE MONEY FOR SERVICES THEY

03:09:12.474 --> 03:09:14.042
CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL THE CHANGE

03:09:14.109 --> 03:09:15.944

RAPE WHICH IS AYBE THREE YEARS

03:09:22.350 --> 03:09:23.785
OLD AND DOESN'T REFLECT THE

03:09:23.852 --> 03:09:26.288
COST OF WHAT THEY'RE- THEY'RE

03:09:26.354 --> 03:09:27.556
ACTUALLY INCURRING. FURTHER

03:09:27.622 --> 03:09:28.890

KNOW. IF THE PROCESS TAKES

03:09:42.604 --> 03:09:44.106
LONGER THAN A YEAR. THEN THE

03:09:44.172 --> 03:09:46.241

03:09:58.854 --> 03:10:00.689
IT'S IMPORTANT TO AT. AND FOR

03:10:00.756 --> 03:10:01.923
AN OPERATOR WHO WISHES TO

RETIRE AND MOVE THE BALL AND WE

NOT SET UP WELL TO. FACILITATE

03:10:09.631 --> 03:10:12.501

03:19:56.851 --> 03:19:58.119
PART OF THIS HAS TO BE A

03:19:58.186 --> 03:20:00.688
SOCIETAL COMMITMENT. TO PAYING

03:20:00.755 --> 03:20:06.194
HIGHER WAGES. TO A PROFESSIONAL

03:20:06.260 --> 03:20:07.128
WORKING STAFF. ON THESE ARE

03:20:07.195 --> 03:20:09.197
SEEN AS THE- WORKERS. AND THEY

03:20:09.263 --> 03:20:31.886
ARE. THEY ARE CARING. FOR WE

03:20:31.953 --> 03:20:32.887
RECOMMEND THAT WE PREPARE

03:20:32.954 --> 03:20:34.255
UNIVERSAL WORKERS AND WE

03:20:34.322 --> 03:20:35.223
ACTUALLY WERE WORKING WITH THE

03:20:35.289 --> 03:20:36.991
MORE FOUNDATION TO EXPLORE HOW

03:20:37.058 --> 03:20:38.359
CALIFORNIA MIGHT BE ABLE TO

03:20:38.426 --> 03:20:40.261
ACHIEVE THIS. THAT IS WE

03:20:40.328 --> 03:20:41.863
PREPARE WORKERS ACROSS ALL

03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:43.898
SETTINGS. WE DON'T HAVE A

03:20:43.965 --> 03:20:45.433
SEPARATE CERTIFICATION FOR

03:20:45.500 --> 03:20:55.810
CNA'S FOR HOME CARE AIDES WE.

03:20:55.877 --> 03:20:56.344
START TO BEGIN TO BUILD AN

03:20:56.411 --> 03:20:57.245
OCCUPATION ACROSS ALL OF THE

03:20:57.311 --> 03:20:58.379
SETTINGS SO THAT THEY CAN NO.

03:20:58.446 --> 03:20:59.947
VERY FLEXIBLE. INCOME OF THE

03:21:00.014 --> 03:21:00.948
TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

03:21:01.015 --> 03:21:02.950
HELP A LOT MORE SO. IN NURSING.

03:21:03.017 --> 03:21:03.718
IF WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO TRAIN

03:21:03.785 --> 03:21:06.120
HARD CARE WORK UP THE C. STAY.

03:21:06.187 --> 03:21:07.755
THAT'S WHAT IN. STATE RIGHT NOW

03:21:07.822 --> 03:21:09.023
WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT OTHER

03:21:09.090 --> 03:21:10.792
STATES IN ORDER TO THINK ABOUT

03:21:10.858 --> 03:21:12.827
FRANCE AND FINALLY I THINK WE

03:21:12.894 --> 03:21:14.228
NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THE STATE

03:21:14.295 --> 03:21:15.696
LEVEL AT REFORMING LONG TERM

03:21:15.763 --> 03:21:18.032
SERVICES AND SUPPORT FINANCING.

03:21:18.099 --> 03:21:19.801
JUST AS WASHINGTON STATE AND

03:21:19.867 --> 03:21:20.868
NUMBER NUMBER OF OTHER STATES

03:21:20.935 --> 03:21:22.203
ARE LOOKING AT AND I KNOW THE

03:21:22.270 --> 03:21:23.905
CALIFORNIA ALSO IS TAKING A

03:21:23.971 --> 03:21:25.673
LOOK AT THIS. HOW DO WE MAKE

03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:27.308
SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ON

03:21:27.375 --> 03:21:30.044
MEDICAID. BUT JUST ABOVE THAT

03:21:30.111 --> 03:21:31.979
ONE MIGHT THE MODERATE INCOME

03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:33.481
IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS PRETTY

03:21:33.548 --> 03:21:35.183
DARN HOT AT THIS POINT I KNOW I

03:21:35.249 --> 03:21:36.751
USED TO LIVE THERE AND I HAVE

03:21:36.818 --> 03:21:39.187
FRIENDS WHO STILL DO. HOW CAN

03:21:39.253 --> 03:21:43.891
THEY AFFORD TO PAY. FOR THE

03:21:43.958 --> 03:21:45.760
SERVICE. I DON'T HAVE MEDICATE.

03:21:45.827 --> 03:21:47.695
HOW TO THEY PAY PRIVATE IN A

03:21:47.762 --> 03:22:08.382
NURSING HOME WHEN WE KNOW.

03:26:04.085 --> 03:26:04.151
I

03:26:04.151 --> 03:26:08.622
MEAN DOES IT MAKE SENSE THAT

03:26:08.689 --> 03:26:09.890
THAT AN INTERIM MANAGEMENT

03:26:09.957 --> 03:26:13.828
AGREEMENT WOULD ALLOW- YOU KNOW

03:26:13.894 --> 03:26:15.996
THE- THE APPLICANT WHOSE

03:26:16.063 --> 03:26:17.765
APPLICATION WAS DENIED TO

03:26:17.832 --> 03:26:19.500
CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE

03:26:19.567 --> 03:26:21.135
YEAH I GUESS I WOULD JUST TELL

03:26:21.202 --> 03:26:23.604
YOU THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING AT

03:26:23.671 --> 03:26:25.139
LEAST AND I DON'T KNOW THIS

03:26:25.206 --> 03:26:26.507
PARTICULAR SITUATIONS I DON'T

03:26:26.574 --> 03:26:27.641
KNOW THAT I WANT TO COMMENT ON

03:26:27.708 --> 03:26:29.243
ON ON THAT ONE BUT I WOULD JUST

03:26:29.310 --> 03:26:32.079
SAY. THAT SOMETIMES

03:26:32.146 --> 03:26:34.515
APPLICATIONS ARE DENIED FOR AN

03:26:34.582 --> 03:26:36.784
ACCURATE BASED ON INACCURATE

03:26:36.851 --> 03:26:38.786
INFORMATION ENACTED REASONS

03:26:38.853 --> 03:26:40.121
THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS

03:26:40.187 --> 03:26:42.022
THROUGH THESE AND FREQUENTLY

03:26:42.089 --> 03:26:44.125
THOSE DECISIONS ARE OVERTURNED

03:26:44.191 --> 03:26:45.960
SO I'VE AGAIN NOT KNOWING THAT

03:26:46.026 --> 03:26:46.827
THE PARTICULAR SITUATION I DO

03:26:46.894 --> 03:26:49.263
THANK. YOU NOTE DUE PROCESS AND

03:26:49.330 --> 03:26:51.198
REVIEW OF THESE OF TE HAVE ANY

03:26:51.265 --> 03:26:53.267
KIND OF DENIAL IS AN IMPORTANT

03:26:53.334 --> 03:26:55.836
FACTOR IS CERTAINLY AS AS AS A

03:26:55.903 --> 03:26:58.038
FORMER PROSECUTOR AND PUBLIC

03:26:58.105 --> 03:26:59.807
DEFENDER I CAN CERTAINLY

03:26:59.874 --> 03:27:00.841
APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:27:00.908 --> 03:27:03.611
DUE PROCESS BUT- I THINK FROM

03:27:03.677 --> 03:27:06.814
THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NURSING

03:27:06.881 --> 03:27:08.048
HOME RESIDENT PROTECTION

03:27:08.115 --> 03:27:10.751
CONSUMER PROTECTION- PUBLIC

03:27:10.818 --> 03:27:12.753
HEALTH PROTECTION. I MEAN

03:27:12.820 --> 03:27:15.222
WOULDN'T AS AS THE LICENSING

03:27:15.289 --> 03:27:17.625
AGENCY- AND THE ENFORCEMENT

03:27:17.691 --> 03:27:21.462
AGENCY WE WOULDN'T- WOULDN'T IT

03:27:21.529 --> 03:27:23.831
MAKE MORE SENSE THAT THAT IF A

03:27:23.898 --> 03:27:26.901
APPLICANTS AB AN APPLICATION

03:27:26.967 --> 03:27:28.102

RIGHT TO APPEAL. THAT IN THE

03:27:36.377 --> 03:27:38.712
MEANTIME YOU KNOW THE PER

03:27:38.779 --> 03:27:39.814
SHOULD BE WITH THE FINDING OF

03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:41.182
THE AGENCY THAT THAT THEIR

03:27:41.248 --> 03:27:42.082
APPLICATION TO OPERATE THE

03:27:42.149 --> 03:27:44.318

BRING LET ME LET ME PLAY THIS

03:27:45.719 --> 03:27:47.621
OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT. WHERE

03:27:47.688 --> 03:27:49.757
DOES THE FACILITY GO THEM. GOOD

03:27:49.824 --> 03:27:51.258
TO GO BACK TO THE PRIOR.

03:27:51.325 --> 03:27:53.861
OPERATOR IN SOME CASES WE KNOW

03:27:53.928 --> 03:27:55.095
A SITUATE WE KNOW OF SITUATIONS

03:27:55.162 --> 03:27:56.831
FREQUENTLY WERE SOMETIMES.

03:27:56.897 --> 03:27:57.965
MAYBE A SITUATION WOULD BE

03:27:58.032 --> 03:28:00.034
THAT- MAYBE WOULD. NOT I DON'T

03:28:00.100 --> 03:28:01.569
WANT FREELY BUT A SITUATION

03:28:01.635 --> 03:28:04.004
WHERE. A FACILITY HAS. CHANGED

03:28:04.071 --> 03:28:06.507
OWNERSHIP BE UP PRIOR OWNER HAS

03:28:06.574 --> 03:28:08.242
GOTTEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS-

03:28:08.309 --> 03:28:10.511
RETIRED MOVED ON. AND IN SOME

03:28:10.578 --> 03:28:13.013
CASES THAT IF THE NEW OWNER IS

03:28:13.080 --> 03:28:14.448
SHIP IS DENIED WHETHER INTERIM

03:28:14.515 --> 03:28:16.283

BECOME THE NEW OPERATOR YEAH

03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:21.255
AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S A

03:28:21.322 --> 03:28:22.857
CONSIDERATION I THINK TO MAKE

03:28:22.923 --> 03:28:24.558
YOU KNOW SORT OF A BLANKET

03:28:24.625 --> 03:28:25.292
NOTION THAT SOMEONE TONIGHT

03:28:25.359 --> 03:28:27.761
CANNOT. THE ALL THOSE

03:28:27.828 --> 03:28:28.896
CONSIDERATIONS IN THOSE DOWN

03:28:28.963 --> 03:28:31.098
THE LINE. ISSUES HAVE TO BE

03:28:31.165 --> 03:28:33.267
CONSIDERED. I KNOW I APPRECIATE

03:28:33.334 --> 03:28:34.768
YOU RAISING THAT POINT BECAUSE

03:28:34.835 --> 03:28:36.904
LIKE I KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN A-

03:28:36.971 --> 03:28:38.906
IN AN UNSPOKEN OR UNDER DRESSED

03:28:38.973 --> 03:28:40.441
TO THE CHALLENGE IN IN IN THE

03:28:40.507 --> 03:28:42.643
INDUSTRY I MEAN WHAT HAPPENS.

03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:45.646
YOU KNOW IF WE DO- CALL UPON

03:28:45.713 --> 03:28:48.182
OUR REGULATORY AGENCIES TO

03:28:48.249 --> 03:28:51.051
ENFORCE. YOU KNOW OUR OUR

03:28:51.118 --> 03:28:53.120
PUBLIC HEALTH REGULATIONS IS I

03:28:53.187 --> 03:28:54.488
MEAN THAT THAT ULTIMATELY IT'S

03:28:54.555 --> 03:28:56.523
GOING TO SHUT DOWN AND LEAD TO

03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:57.958
THE LOSS OF THAT THAT THAT

03:28:58.025 --> 03:29:01.362
NURSING HOME BEDS- BUT I MEAN

03:29:01.428 --> 03:29:03.831
IS. THERE THAT THE LAW DOES

03:29:03.898 --> 03:29:06.734
ALLOW FOR. THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:29:06.800 --> 03:29:08.903
PUBLIC HEALTH TO PETITION FOR

03:29:08.969 --> 03:29:13.307
RECEIVERSHIP. IT DOES AND- WHY

03:29:13.374 --> 03:29:15.442
WHY WOULDN'T IT MAKE SENSE FOR

03:29:15.509 --> 03:29:16.377
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THAT'S

03:29:16.443 --> 03:29:17.845
PROBABLY NOT A PARTICULARLY

03:29:17.912 --> 03:29:18.979
APPEALING PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO

03:29:19.046 --> 03:29:20.547
WORK. I MEAN I THINK YOU HAVE

03:29:20.614 --> 03:29:22.816
TO ALSO CONSIDER THAT TOOTH THE

03:29:22.883 --> 03:29:24.818
BILL BUILDINGS NEED STABILITY.

03:29:24.885 --> 03:29:25.953
IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO

03:29:26.020 --> 03:29:28.389
ATTRACT WORK RETRACT AND RETAIN

03:29:28.455 --> 03:29:30.824
WORKFORCE AS WELL AND THEN THEY

03:29:30.891 --> 03:29:32.359
NEED THEY NEED THAT IN TERMS OF

03:29:32.426 --> 03:29:34.695
THEIR ABILITY TO- WORK WITH

03:29:34.762 --> 03:29:37.231
THEIR HOSPITAL PARTNERS AND

03:29:37.298 --> 03:29:38.832
WITH THEIR STAFF AS WELL.

03:29:38.899 --> 03:29:40.134
BUILDINGS IN RECEIVERSHIP IN

03:29:40.200 --> 03:29:42.269
AND IN TURMOIL ARE NOT GOOD FOR

03:29:42.336 --> 03:29:44.104
ANYBODY I WOULD SAY SO I THINK

03:29:44.171 --> 03:29:45.739
THAT THAT'S A CONSIDERATION AS

03:29:45.806 --> 03:29:47.374
WELL I MEAN I DON'T AGAIN. I

03:29:47.441 --> 03:29:48.575
DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK WITH

03:29:48.642 --> 03:29:50.778
THERE'S A ONE SIZE ON IN A LOT

03:29:50.844 --> 03:29:52.613
OF THESE ISSUES I THINK IT'S A

03:29:52.680 --> 03:29:54.515
CHALLENGE TO KIND OF RESPOND IN

03:29:54.581 --> 03:29:57.151
THAT BUT I JUST BE CAUTIOUS

03:29:57.217 --> 03:29:58.252
ABOUT THAT. NOTION I BELIEVE

03:29:58.319 --> 03:29:59.720
GOING RECEIVERSHIP WHO'S GOT

03:29:59.787 --> 03:30:00.688

ADMINISTRATORS TO GO IN AND

03:30:07.261 --> 03:30:08.796
STEP IN BUT THOSE ARE NEVER.

03:30:08.862 --> 03:30:10.764
PARTICULARLY GOOD SITUATIONS

TWENTY NINE PROCESS ALL WE'RE

03:32:30.771 --> 03:32:31.271
TALKING ABOUT REIMBURSEMENT

03:32:31.338 --> 03:32:33.073
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT- HOW DO

03:32:33.140 --> 03:32:33.941
WE MOVE THE STRUCTURE WE

03:32:34.007 --> 03:32:35.142
DEFINITELY HAVE TALKED ABOUT

03:32:35.209 --> 03:32:36.610
QUALITY ONE OF THE THINGS. IN

03:32:36.677 --> 03:32:37.711
PARTICULAR HAS BEEN TALKED

03:32:37.778 --> 03:32:39.480
ABOUT THE QUALITY-

03:32:39.546 --> 03:32:40.814
ACCOUNTABILITY SUPPLEMENTAL

03:32:40.881 --> 03:32:42.616
PAYMENT ALSO KNOWN AS THE COST.

03:32:42.683 --> 03:32:44.218
AND THE CURRENT STRUCTURE WHICH

03:32:44.284 --> 03:32:46.019
THAT WE THE STATE IS GOING TO

03:32:46.086 --> 03:32:47.254
MOVE WE ARE IT'S OUR

03:32:47.321 --> 03:32:48.388
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT QUALITY

03:32:48.455 --> 03:32:50.324
PAYMENT WOULD GO AWAY TO THE

03:32:50.390 --> 03:32:52.159
AUTHORS POINT. THOSE FACILITIES

03:32:52.226 --> 03:32:53.994

OTHER REASONS CITATIONS AND

03:33:01.034 --> 03:33:03.670
STUFF. BUT I THINK THAT THE

03:33:03.737 --> 03:33:04.238
SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE PROCESS

03:33:04.304 --> 03:33:05.739
GIVES US THE ABILITY TO HAVE A

03:33:05.806 --> 03:33:07.341

03:33:17.151 --> 03:33:18.152
NEW STRUCTURE IN WHICH THE

03:33:18.218 --> 03:33:19.319

THAT THAT WE ARE ON THIS DIET-

03:34:26.253 --> 03:34:27.221
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE

03:34:27.287 --> 03:34:28.355
REALLY HIGH QUALITY OPERATORS

03:34:28.422 --> 03:34:30.824

LEGISLATORS RESPOND. TO BAD

03:34:41.969 --> 03:34:43.937
ACTORS QUITE FRANKLY OR THINGS

03:34:44.004 --> 03:34:46.273
THAT SIMPLY AREN'T WORKING.

03:34:46.340 --> 03:34:48.675
THIS IS A CLASSIC. THIS COULD

03:34:48.742 --> 03:34:50.410
BE THE POSTER CHILD FOR CLASSIC

03:34:50.477 --> 03:34:52.779
A DYSFUNCTIONAL OF THINGS- IN

03:34:52.846 --> 03:34:54.248
IN GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW AND OUR

03:34:54.314 --> 03:34:55.415
ABILITY OVERSEE THE PUBLIC

03:34:55.482 --> 03:34:57.451
SAFETY. AND QUALITY CARE FOR

03:34:57.517 --> 03:34:58.518
OUR FOR SOME OF OUR MOST

03:34:58.585 --> 03:35:02.322
VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND SO. I

03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:03.690
UNDERSTAND STAFF DIFFICULT TO

03:35:03.757 --> 03:35:05.559
FIND IT'S PARTICULARLY

03:35:05.626 --> 03:35:07.494
DIFFICULT MY DISTRICT- RURAL

03:35:07.561 --> 03:35:09.263
AREAS OR ARE ARE NOTORIOUSLY

03:35:09.329 --> 03:35:10.764
CHALLENGING FOR ALL HEALTH

03:35:10.831 --> 03:35:14.201
CARE- A PERSONAL AS WELL. I

03:35:14.268 --> 03:35:15.002
KNOW MEDICARE RATES ARE NOT AS

03:35:15.068 --> 03:35:17.170
HIGH AS A- PEOPLE WOULD LIKE

03:35:17.237 --> 03:35:19.773
THEM TO BE. BUT THERE'S

03:35:19.840 --> 03:35:20.507
SOMETHING PECULIAR HAPPENING

03:35:20.574 --> 03:35:22.209
OUT THERE AND THAT'S THE

03:35:22.276 --> 03:35:24.211
ENTRANCE OF. PRIVATE EQUITY

03:35:24.278 --> 03:35:25.779
INVESTING INVESTING IN SKILLED

THERE THERE'S PROFIT OUT THERE

03:35:33.287 --> 03:35:35.622
BECAUSE PRIVATE EQUITY IS NOT

03:35:35.689 --> 03:35:37.691
GOING TO GO INTO FACILITIES IF

03:35:37.758 --> 03:35:39.826
THEY DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO

03:35:39.893 --> 03:35:40.360
MAKE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

03:35:40.427 --> 03:35:45.299
RETURN- THAT'S- AND I'VE I'VE

03:35:45.365 --> 03:35:46.867
HEARD THIS FROM REPRESENTATIVES

OF PUBLIC OF PRIVATE EQUITY SO.

03:35:49.303 --> 03:35:49.803
THIS IS I'M NOT JUST PULLING

03:35:49.870 --> 03:35:51.505
THIS OUT OF THE YEAR. THEY'RE

03:35:51.571 --> 03:35:52.739
GOING TO DO SOMETHING FOR AN

03:35:52.806 --> 03:35:55.809
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY.

03:35:55.876 --> 03:35:56.543
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THAT'S

03:35:56.610 --> 03:35:58.679
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. SO MANY

03:35:58.745 --> 03:36:00.947
OF- MANY OF THE OWNERS OF A LOT

03:36:01.014 --> 03:36:02.549
OF HOMES MAKE A CONSIDERABLE

03:36:02.616 --> 03:36:05.052
AMOUNT OF MONEY- ESPECIALLY

03:36:05.118 --> 03:36:07.020
THROUGH THEIR USE OF- RELATED

03:36:07.087 --> 03:36:10.524
PARTIES. WE BECAME AWARE THAT

03:36:10.590 --> 03:36:12.693
SEVERAL YEARS AGO LOOK AT THAT.

03:36:12.759 --> 03:36:17.664
IT'S ALLOWED- BUT. IT'S STILL

03:36:17.731 --> 03:36:20.367
TROUBLING BECAUSE- IT FEELS A

03:36:20.434 --> 03:36:23.337
LITTLE LIKE. ROBBING PETER TO

03:36:23.403 --> 03:36:25.138
PAY PAUL I CAN'T THINK OF

03:36:25.205 --> 03:36:25.906
ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THAT AT THIS

03:36:25.972 --> 03:36:29.242
POINT SO CAN YOU GIVE US. AN

03:36:29.309 --> 03:36:31.311
ESTIMATE AS TO HOW MANY SKILLED

03:36:31.378 --> 03:36:31.778
NURSING FACILITIES IN

03:36:31.845 --> 03:36:35.215
CALIFORNIA. MIGHT BE USING

03:36:35.282 --> 03:36:37.451
SKINNER THE RELATED PARTIES AND

03:36:37.517 --> 03:36:39.019
HOW PROFITABLE THOSE

03:36:39.086 --> 03:36:41.421
ARRANGEMENTS ARE FOR OWNERS WE

03:36:41.488 --> 03:36:43.523
HEARD FROM WAS VALENTINE. IT IS

03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:46.393
REALLY PROFITABLE WELL I HAVE

03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:49.029
TO- WELL FOR THE RECORD I

03:36:49.096 --> 03:36:50.297
DISAGREED WITH ALMOST

03:36:50.364 --> 03:36:52.232
EVERYTHING WITH OUTSIDE SAID.

03:36:52.299 --> 03:36:53.700
SO AND I WITHOUT GETTING INTO

03:36:53.767 --> 03:36:54.935
THAT I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO

03:36:55.001 --> 03:36:56.203
GET INTO THAT BUT I WANT TO I

03:36:56.269 --> 03:36:57.838
DID I I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN

03:36:57.904 --> 03:36:59.239
GIVE YOU FIGURES ON THIS BUT I

03:36:59.306 --> 03:37:00.140
WANT I WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL

03:37:00.207 --> 03:37:02.008
PERSPECTIVE. ON THIS ISSUE OF

03:37:02.075 --> 03:37:04.444
RELATED PARTIES THE DEPARTMENT

03:37:04.511 --> 03:37:07.647
OF. HEALTH CARE SERVICES AUDITS

03:37:07.714 --> 03:37:10.016
IN MINUTE DETAIL EVERY

03:37:10.083 --> 03:37:12.319
EXPENDITURE OF A SKILLED

03:37:12.386 --> 03:37:13.387
NURSING FACILITY THEY DO

03:37:13.453 --> 03:37:15.489
ACTUALLY TWO YEARS IN ARREARS-

03:37:15.555 --> 03:37:17.124
AND THEN THAT'S HOW FACILITIES

03:37:17.190 --> 03:37:18.191
ARE PAID THIS THE FEE FOR

03:37:18.258 --> 03:37:20.627
SERVICE- SITUATION THEY HAVE

03:37:20.694 --> 03:37:22.362
FACILITIES HAVE TO DOCUMENT

03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:25.265
EVERY SINGLE THING IF CD IF THE

03:37:25.332 --> 03:37:27.667
DH CS FIND SOMETHING. THAT IS

03:37:27.734 --> 03:37:29.703
OUT OF LINE IN SOME WAY THAT IS

03:37:29.770 --> 03:37:31.271
DENIED AND THOSE AT FACILITIES

03:37:31.338 --> 03:37:32.606
pARE NOT REIMBURSED FOR THAT

03:37:32.672 --> 03:37:34.174
THEM SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT

03:37:34.241 --> 03:37:35.842
OF CHECKS ON RELATED PARTIES

03:37:35.909 --> 03:37:37.577

OTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS

03:37:47.454 --> 03:37:49.189
THOUGH IS IF THERE WAS IF THERE

03:37:49.256 --> 03:37:51.758
WAS SUCH A- PROFITABLE

03:37:51.825 --> 03:37:54.060
SITUATION. WE WOULD HAVE MORE

03:37:55.829 --> 03:37:57.764
THIS PROFESSION THAT IS NOT THE

03:37:57.831 --> 03:37:59.866
CASE THERE ARE ALMOST NO NEW

03:37:59.933 --> 03:38:01.201
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

03:38:01.268 --> 03:38:02.002
BEING CONSTRUCTED IN

03:38:02.068 --> 03:38:04.171
CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT'S JUST

03:38:04.237 --> 03:38:05.505
NOT THE CASE IT IS NOT A PLACE

03:38:05.572 --> 03:38:08.408
THAT IS. A PLACE TO COME IN AND

03:38:08.475 --> 03:38:09.943
DO PARTICULARLY WELL RIGHT NOW

03:38:10.010 --> 03:38:11.678
IT JUST ISN'T THE COST OF THE

03:38:11.745 --> 03:38:13.013
COST OF OPERATING CALIFORNIA

03:38:13.079 --> 03:38:14.714
THE COST THE REGULATORY COSTS

03:38:14.781 --> 03:38:17.384
ARE ENORMOUS. SO I THINK THAT'S

03:38:17.451 --> 03:38:19.052
A LITTLE BIT OF A AB PROVE IT

03:38:19.119 --> 03:38:21.655
MAY NOT BE. EXACTLY WHAT IT

03:38:21.721 --> 03:38:22.222
APPEARS I WOULD ALSO JUST

03:38:22.289 --> 03:38:24.558
MENTION TO YOU THAT- TO

03:38:24.624 --> 03:38:26.026
EFFECTIVE IN REFERENCE TO THE

03:38:26.092 --> 03:38:26.927
QUESTION DO YOU HAVE FROM

03:38:26.993 --> 03:38:29.229
SWEDEN. OF THE FACILITIES IN

03:38:29.296 --> 03:38:31.231
CALIFORNIA. I'VE GOT ROUGHLY

03:38:31.298 --> 03:38:33.934
CORRECT. BUT 85% OF PRIVATELY

03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:38.338
OWNED. BUT- TEN PERCENT. ARE

03:38:38.405 --> 03:38:40.674
PUB ARE ARE- ARE- NONPROFITS

03:38:40.740 --> 03:38:42.309
ABOUT 5% I BELIEVE. OUR

03:38:42.375 --> 03:38:43.710
GOVERNMENTAL OUT THAT WOULD BE

03:38:43.777 --> 03:38:45.879
LIKE THE VETS HOMES- ADVOCATES

03:38:45.946 --> 03:38:48.048
HOMES NOT THAT KIND OF THING. I

03:38:48.114 --> 03:38:49.149
WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THERE'S A

03:38:49.216 --> 03:38:51.551
BIG DIFFERENCE IN WHO IS CARED

03:38:51.618 --> 03:38:55.088
FOR BETWEEN. THE NONPROFITS AND

03:38:55.155 --> 03:38:57.023
THE OF THE OTHERS. MOST OF THE

03:38:57.090 --> 03:39:00.494
MEDIC CAL POPULATION IS CARED

03:39:00.560 --> 03:39:02.329
FOR IN THE LARGEST GROUP. THE

03:39:02.395 --> 03:39:04.331
NONPROFITS TEND TO CARE FOR

03:39:04.397 --> 03:39:06.266
MOSTLY MORE THAN MEDICARE

03:39:06.333 --> 03:39:07.801
SHORTER TERM POPULATIONS AND

03:39:07.868 --> 03:39:08.835
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION

03:39:08.902 --> 03:39:10.670
I THINK- THAT THAT I THINK

03:39:10.737 --> 03:39:13.006
SOMETIMES GETS MISSED AND SOME

03:39:13.073 --> 03:39:14.608
OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL.

03:39:14.674 --> 03:39:16.276
SO I WANTED TO HAVE A LITTLE

03:39:16.343 --> 03:39:18.211
DEEPER HERE BECAUSE- I WAS A

03:39:18.278 --> 03:39:20.113
MID PACK REPORT- LITERATURE

03:39:20.180 --> 03:39:22.516
REVIEW ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY

03:39:22.582 --> 03:39:25.018
INVOLVED. AND THEY LOOKED AT A

03:39:25.085 --> 03:39:26.253
VARIETY OF ISSUES IT WAS A

03:39:26.319 --> 03:39:28.421
LITERATURE REVIEW SO- IT'S NOT

03:39:28.488 --> 03:39:30.223
RAW DATA LOVE TO SEE RAW DATA

03:39:30.290 --> 03:39:34.361
QUITE FRANKLY- BUT- 4% OF

03:39:34.427 --> 03:39:37.497
HOSPITALS. ARE ARE HAVE PRIVATE

03:39:37.564 --> 03:39:41.668
EQUITY. INVESTMENT THERE. 11%

03:39:41.735 --> 03:39:44.004
OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES.

03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:47.173
11% THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE

03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:48.575
THERE OBVIOUSLY IF THAT'S

03:39:48.642 --> 03:39:51.278
HAPPENING AND THESE THIRD PARTY

03:39:51.344 --> 03:39:53.914
ARRANGEMENTS. YOU WOULDN'T GO

03:39:53.980 --> 03:39:55.515
TO A LOT OF EFFORT TO DO THAT

03:39:55.582 --> 03:39:57.484
IF THERE WASN'T SOME SORT OF A

03:39:57.551 --> 03:39:59.586
MOTIVE TO MAKE TO MAKE MORE

03:39:59.653 --> 03:40:01.655
MONEY OR TO TRY TO CREATE A

03:40:01.721 --> 03:40:04.658
BETTER TAX INCENTIVE OR PROCESS

03:40:04.724 --> 03:40:08.061
FOR YOURSELF. SO YOU KNOW WE I

03:40:08.128 --> 03:40:09.429
WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU KNOW

03:40:09.496 --> 03:40:10.897
WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS

03:40:10.964 --> 03:40:12.899
IN THE PAST OF LET'S SEE. HOW

03:40:12.966 --> 03:40:14.434
WE YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN DIG

03:40:14.501 --> 03:40:15.802
DEEPER INTO THAT AND GET GET

03:40:15.869 --> 03:40:18.405
MORE INFORMATION SO. I SAY TO

03:40:18.471 --> 03:40:20.140
WIN THERE WITH TWELVE HUNDRED

03:40:20.206 --> 03:40:21.675
AND ONE ALSO MAKE REFERENCE TO

03:40:21.741 --> 03:40:23.710
A POINT YOU MADE EARLIER TO-

03:40:23.777 --> 03:40:24.678
MISTER CHAIRMAN I'VE BECAUSE I

03:40:24.744 --> 03:40:26.813
APPRECIATED THE POINT YOU MADE.

03:40:26.880 --> 03:40:27.714
AND THAT IS BEING RESPONSIVE

03:40:27.781 --> 03:40:30.350
TO- PARTICULAR INCIDENTS IN

03:40:30.417 --> 03:40:31.885
PARTICULAR FACILITIES YOU HERE

03:40:31.952 --> 03:40:33.587
AND I APPRECIATE THAT I WORK IN

03:40:33.653 --> 03:40:34.654
THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIRTY

03:40:34.721 --> 03:40:36.056
YEARS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

03:40:36.122 --> 03:40:37.824
IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO

03:40:37.891 --> 03:40:40.460
DO WHAT YOU DO HERE. AND BEING

03:40:40.527 --> 03:40:41.761
RESPONSIVE TO YOUR TO YOUR

03:40:41.828 --> 03:40:44.130
CONSTITUENTS I WOULD JUST URGE

03:40:44.197 --> 03:40:45.799
YOU THOUGH PLEASE DON'T MAKE

03:40:45.865 --> 03:40:48.068
POLICY BASED ON A FEW OF THOSE

03:40:48.134 --> 03:40:49.603
THIS TWELVE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE

03:40:49.669 --> 03:40:52.772
FACILITY. SKILLED NURSING

03:40:52.839 --> 03:40:53.673
FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS

03:40:53.740 --> 03:40:54.574
I MEAN I DON'T SAY MAJORITY I

03:40:54.641 --> 03:40:58.445
WOULD SAY. THE VAST VAST VAST

03:40:58.511 --> 03:41:01.514
VAST VAST GROUP PROVIDE GREAT

03:41:01.581 --> 03:41:02.849
QUALITY CARE EVERY DAY AND THE

03:41:02.916 --> 03:41:04.584
ONES THAT HAVE ARE STRUGGLING

03:41:04.651 --> 03:41:05.518
ARE STRUGGLING FOR A LOT OF

03:41:05.585 --> 03:41:08.021
DIFFERENT REASONS. AND FOR ME

03:41:08.088 --> 03:41:09.789
AT LAST IT'S ALL IT'S ALMOST

03:41:09.856 --> 03:41:11.191
AN ISSUE HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE

03:41:11.257 --> 03:41:13.827
STRUGGLING FACILITIES VERSUS

03:41:13.893 --> 03:41:15.962
DOING SOMETHING LEGISLATIVELY

03:41:16.029 --> 03:41:16.896
THAT MAKES IT HARDER IN THE

03:41:16.963 --> 03:41:18.832
ENTIRE SECTOR GOING FOR THAT'S

03:41:18.898 --> 03:41:20.433
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. ON THE

03:41:20.500 --> 03:41:23.136
PRIVATE EQUITY- I GUESS THE

03:41:23.203 --> 03:41:24.838
ONLY THING I'D SAY TO WITH IF

03:41:24.904 --> 03:41:26.840
IT'S 11% OF TWELVE HUNDRED

03:41:26.906 --> 03:41:28.408
FACILITIES THAT'S A RELATIVELY

03:41:28.475 --> 03:41:30.443
SMALL NUMBER AND I DON'T KNOW

03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:33.113
ENOUGH ABOUT. THIS PARTICULAR

03:41:33.179 --> 03:41:33.913
SITUATIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:41:33.980 --> 03:41:36.082
I DO KNOW. AT LEAST NATIONALLY

03:41:36.149 --> 03:41:37.217
BECAUSE I LOOK AT THAT A LOT OF

03:41:37.283 --> 03:41:38.618
THE NATIONAL DATA ON THIS AS

03:41:38.685 --> 03:41:40.954
WELL. THERE'S A LOT OF. BAD

03:41:41.021 --> 03:41:42.088
BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT BEEN

03:41:42.155 --> 03:41:43.623
MADE BY SOME IN THE PRIVATE

03:41:43.690 --> 03:41:45.825
EQUITY WORLD TO AS TO WHAT

03:41:45.892 --> 03:41:47.260
THEY'VE GOTTEN INTO COULD HAVE

03:41:47.327 --> 03:41:48.862
BEEN IT'S BENEFICIAL TO THEM IN

03:41:48.928 --> 03:41:51.164
SOME CASES. SOME PRIVATE EQUITY

03:41:51.231 --> 03:41:53.633
WITH OWNING THE LAND AND OVER

03:41:53.700 --> 03:41:55.435
THE LAST FEW YEARS ON THE LAND

03:41:55.502 --> 03:41:56.436
THAT FACILITIES THAN WE'RE

03:41:56.503 --> 03:41:58.304
PAYING THE RENT ON THAT AS

03:41:58.371 --> 03:41:59.005
ACTUALLY DROVE A LOT OF

03:41:59.072 --> 03:42:01.141
FACILITIES. OUT OF BUSINESS

03:42:01.207 --> 03:42:03.510
BECAUSE THE OWNERSHIP OF THE

03:42:03.576 --> 03:42:05.045
LAND BUT WITH THEY WERE

03:42:05.111 --> 03:42:07.180
CHARGING. EXORBITANT RATES TO

03:42:07.247 --> 03:42:08.481
THE OPERATORS OF THE FACILITIES

03:42:08.548 --> 03:42:11.217
THAT ACTUALLY WAS ONE OF THE

03:42:11.284 --> 03:42:11.818
CRISES WE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT

03:42:11.885 --> 03:42:13.186
THE STATE'S. AND THAT THAT

03:42:13.253 --> 03:42:14.320
INFORMATION THAT WAS NATIONAL

03:42:14.387 --> 03:42:15.422
DATA THAT WASN'T I WOULD LOVE

03:42:15.488 --> 03:42:16.790
TO SEE STATE DATA I DON'T WE

03:42:16.856 --> 03:42:19.092
DON'T HAVE IT AND I WOULD LOVE

03:42:19.159 --> 03:42:21.027
TO SEE THAT- GOING FORWARD SO.

03:42:21.094 --> 03:42:21.828
HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT

03:42:21.895 --> 03:42:23.697
SO I KNOW THAT- I KNOW IT'S

03:42:23.763 --> 03:42:25.031
ALWAYS WE'RE ALWAYS HEARING

03:42:25.098 --> 03:42:25.965
IT'S YOU KNOW WE WANT HIGHER

03:42:26.032 --> 03:42:27.600
REIMBURSEMENT RATES WE WANT

03:42:27.667 --> 03:42:31.671
STAFFING WAIVERS- GET YET YOU

03:42:31.738 --> 03:42:32.772
HAVE. YOU MANY OF YOUR OWNERS

03:42:32.839 --> 03:42:34.240
MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

03:42:34.307 --> 03:42:36.276
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NOT

03:42:36.342 --> 03:42:39.245
ALL BUT MANY OF THEM- IN RENT.

03:42:39.312 --> 03:42:41.147
AND CONSULTING FEES AND-

03:42:41.214 --> 03:42:43.083
THROUGH SOME OF THESE THIRD

03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:45.985
PARTY ARRANGEMENTS- CAN YOU

03:42:46.052 --> 03:42:46.820
HELP US THAT FEELS LIKE A BIG

03:42:46.886 --> 03:42:48.254
DISCONNECT. I WOULD SAY. GO

03:42:48.321 --> 03:42:49.723
BACK WHAT I WHAT I WOULD GO

03:42:49.789 --> 03:42:51.057
BACK TO WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

03:42:51.124 --> 03:42:52.959
ALL THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ARE ALL

03:42:53.026 --> 03:42:54.094
REVIEWED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:42:54.160 --> 03:42:55.929
HEALTH CARE SERVICES AN AUDITED

03:42:55.995 --> 03:42:58.231
IF SOMETHING IS. IN CORRECTLY

03:42:58.298 --> 03:43:00.600
DONE. IT IS DISALLOWED. SO I

03:43:00.667 --> 03:43:03.002
JUST I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT. I

03:43:03.069 --> 03:43:03.603
MEAN I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

03:43:03.670 --> 03:43:05.438
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THIS BUT-

03:43:05.505 --> 03:43:07.574
THIS THIS SECTOR IS. MORE

03:43:07.640 --> 03:43:09.175
TRANSPARENT THAN ANY OTHER PART

03:43:09.242 --> 03:43:12.011
OF THE HEALTHCARE WORLD. IN

03:43:12.078 --> 03:43:14.881
TERMS OF ITS FINANCES. SO WE

03:43:14.948 --> 03:43:16.583
SHALL SEE YEAH I THOUGHT I'D I

03:43:16.649 --> 03:43:19.119
JUST. BY THAT I DON'T I DON'T

03:43:19.185 --> 03:43:21.287
THINK THIS IS EXACTLY AS IS

03:43:21.354 --> 03:43:21.821
BEING PORTRAYED FREQUENTLY

03:43:21.888 --> 03:43:24.791
HOMES. IT'S HARD NOT TO BE

03:43:24.858 --> 03:43:26.793
SKEPTICAL FROM OUR POSITION-

03:43:26.860 --> 03:43:29.662
WHEN WE HEAR SOME. SOME PRETTY

03:43:29.729 --> 03:43:31.498
EGREGIOUS EGREGIOUS STORIES AND

03:43:31.564 --> 03:43:33.533

ASSOCIATION IS INTERESTED IN

03:43:39.139 --> 03:43:40.373
WORKING THIS WE HAVE A

03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:42.108
COMMITMENT FROM DEPARTMENT OF

03:43:42.175 --> 03:43:43.610
HEALTH TO WORK FOR THIS I HOPE

03:43:43.676 --> 03:43:44.944
THAT WE CAN ALL SIT DOWN AND

03:43:45.011 --> 03:43:48.915
REALLY WORK ON THIS ISSUE- AND-

03:43:48.982 --> 03:43:50.717
AND HELP WITH THIS LICENSING

03:43:50.784 --> 03:43:52.719
PROCESS. AND RE CERTIFICATION

03:43:52.786 --> 03:43:53.853
PROCESS THAT GOES ALONG WITH

03:43:53.920 --> 03:43:55.789
IT. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE

03:43:55.855 --> 03:43:58.158
FACILITIES CLOSE THAT IS THAT

03:43:58.224 --> 03:43:59.893
IS THE THAT'S THE FINE LINE WE

03:43:59.959 --> 03:44:02.262
WALK HERE IT'S REALLY REALLY

03:44:02.328 --> 03:44:04.531
CHALLENGING. BUT WE HAVE TO BE

03:44:04.597 --> 03:44:05.999
QUALITY THEY HAVE TO BE SERVING

03:44:06.065 --> 03:44:08.635
THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE- AND I

03:44:08.701 --> 03:44:10.236
RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A DIFFICULT

03:44:10.303 --> 03:44:12.238
THAT IT'S A DIFFICULT INDUSTRY

03:44:12.305 --> 03:44:14.007
IT'S IS NOT WITHOUT CHALLENGES.

03:44:14.073 --> 03:44:15.508
IT'S BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

03:44:15.575 --> 03:44:16.743
DIFFICULT INDUSTRIES OUT THERE

03:44:16.810 --> 03:44:17.811
THAT ARE NOT WITHOUT

03:44:17.877 --> 03:44:20.280

FOLLOW- AND I AND- AND THEY

03:44:30.123 --> 03:44:30.990
DIED BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO

03:44:31.057 --> 03:44:33.827
BE REASONABLE- AND- AND I THINK

03:44:33.893 --> 03:44:35.962
THEY NEED TO BE FAIR. BUT FIRST

03:44:36.029 --> 03:44:38.097

ABANDONED THAT PROCESS AS WE

03:45:16.102 --> 03:45:17.303

WHAT WE WOULD REALLY LOVE IS

03:45:59.479 --> 03:46:02.715
FOR THE INDUSTRY. TO PUT

03:46:02.782 --> 03:46:04.183

03:46:06.386 --> 03:46:09.322
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- WE SEE

03:46:09.389 --> 03:46:11.024

03:46:36.449 --> 03:46:37.750
FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE

03:46:37.817 --> 03:46:39.886
TRULY APPALLING. IT USE WHAT

03:46:39.953 --> 03:46:41.354
YOU SAID HERE THAT THAT WE WERE

03:46:41.421 --> 03:46:43.189
LIKE A SHINING STAR IN THE

03:46:43.256 --> 03:46:47.226
NATION. I'M SHOCKED. WELL I

03:46:47.293 --> 03:46:49.329

03:46:56.202 --> 03:46:57.804
WAY TOO MANY DEATHS. WAY TOO

03:46:57.870 --> 03:47:01.841
MANY DEATHS. WE SAW THIS

03:47:01.908 --> 03:47:02.575
PANDEMIC PLAYING OUT IN

03:47:02.642 --> 03:47:04.811
WASHINGTON A COUPLE OF MONTHS

03:47:04.877 --> 03:47:07.480
BEFORE. IT STARTED IN

03:47:07.547 --> 03:47:08.781
CALIFORNIA AND YET IT TOOK A

03:47:08.848 --> 03:47:12.018
COUPLE OF MONTHS TO READY AND

03:47:12.085 --> 03:47:13.720
BEGIN TO REACT WE KNEW WHAT WAS

03:47:13.786 --> 03:47:15.355
HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON WE KNEW

03:47:15.421 --> 03:47:17.457
IT YOU SAW IT PLAYING OUT IT

03:47:17.523 --> 03:47:19.592
STILL TOOK A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

03:47:19.659 --> 03:47:22.128
AND THAT MEANT PEOPLE GOT SICK

03:47:22.195 --> 03:47:22.695
AND THAT MEANT. THAT PEOPLE

03:47:22.762 --> 03:47:26.332
DIED. I EXPECT BETTER FROM US

03:47:26.399 --> 03:47:27.133
WE DESERVE BETTER HERE IN

03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:32.271
CALIFORNIA- AND I DO I'M I'M A

03:47:32.338 --> 03:47:33.339
LITTLE PART OF THE YEAH IF

03:47:33.406 --> 03:47:34.941
WE'RE IF WE WERE THE BEST A

03:47:35.008 --> 03:47:36.009
SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT WAS GOING

03:47:36.075 --> 03:47:37.910
ON OTHER STATES AND- PRETTY

03:47:37.977 --> 03:47:39.479
PRETTY PRETTY SHOCKED BY THAT

03:47:39.545 --> 03:47:41.214
WELL IT JUST IT JUST AS A POINT

03:47:41.280 --> 03:47:43.049
ON THAT. EVERY DEATH IS A

03:47:43.116 --> 03:47:44.817
TRAGEDY- I WANT TO MAKE THAT

03:47:44.884 --> 03:47:47.186
CLEAR TO AND WE KNOW THAT THAT

03:47:47.253 --> 03:47:49.155
WOULD THAT IS IT WAS VERY HARD

03:47:49.222 --> 03:47:50.757
ON OUR STAFF WHO WORK IN THOSE

03:47:50.823 --> 03:47:51.424
FACILITIES CLEARLY ON THE

03:47:51.491 --> 03:47:53.626
FAMILIES. NO QUESTION BUT I

03:47:53.693 --> 03:47:54.894
THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER

03:47:54.961 --> 03:47:56.696
WHAT WE WERE FACING AT THE TIME

03:47:56.763 --> 03:47:59.499
WE ARE FACING A PANDEMIC THAT.

03:47:59.565 --> 03:48:01.300
IT IT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE

03:48:01.367 --> 03:48:03.870
PEOPLE. FOR ELDERLY AND PEOPLE

03:48:03.936 --> 03:48:05.471
WITH. MEDIC WITH SERIOUS

03:48:05.538 --> 03:48:07.173
MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT IS A

03:48:07.240 --> 03:48:08.608
100% OF THE POPULATION AND

03:48:08.674 --> 03:48:10.410
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AT

03:48:10.476 --> 03:48:11.411
THE SAME TIME WE WERE FACING A

03:48:11.477 --> 03:48:13.813
PANDEMIC. WITH THE GUIDANCE AND

03:48:13.880 --> 03:48:15.548
THE CLINICAL GUIDANCE. WITH

03:48:15.615 --> 03:48:18.117
CHANGING. RAPIDLY IF YOU RECALL

03:48:18.184 --> 03:48:20.553
FRED MONTHS. OF FACILITIES WERE

03:48:20.620 --> 03:48:22.622
TOLD AND THE PUBLIC WAS TOLD.

03:48:22.688 --> 03:48:24.190
THAT IF YOU WEREN'T. I DID NOT

03:48:24.257 --> 03:48:25.258
HAVE SYMPTOMS YOU COULD NOT

03:48:25.324 --> 03:48:26.492
SPREAD THE DISEASE. THAT WAS

03:48:26.559 --> 03:48:28.594
INCORRECT. WE KNOW THAT NOW IT

03:48:28.661 --> 03:48:30.296
THAT WOULD BUT THAT WAS. THAT

03:48:30.363 --> 03:48:31.631
THAT IT ENTERED BUILDINGS THAT

03:48:31.697 --> 03:48:33.399
WAY INITIALLY AT THE SAME TIME.

03:48:33.466 --> 03:48:36.169
WE HAD NO TESTING. WE HAD NO PP

03:48:36.235 --> 03:48:38.938
FOR MANY MANY MONTHS. AND AS I

03:48:39.005 --> 03:48:41.574
SAID PEOPLE WERE KIND OF UNDER

03:48:41.641 --> 03:48:43.242
LEARNING WHAT WAS GOING ON. IN

03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:46.779
TIME- IN IN REAL TIME- AS

03:48:46.846 --> 03:48:48.815
TRAGIC AS IT IS- THE FACT THAT

03:48:48.881 --> 03:48:50.583
WE ARE NOW WHERE WE ARE. I

03:48:50.650 --> 03:48:52.885
THINK IT'S A IT'S A TRIBUTE. TO

03:48:52.952 --> 03:48:54.720
HOW WELL THE VACCINES OF WORKED

03:48:54.787 --> 03:48:55.955
AND HOW WELL OUR FACILITIES

03:48:56.022 --> 03:48:58.324
HAVE UP HAVE- YOU KNOW WE'RE

03:48:58.391 --> 03:48:59.525
RAISE THE LEVEL THEIR GAME ON

03:48:59.592 --> 03:49:02.195
INFECTION PREVENTION- AND

03:49:02.261 --> 03:49:03.963
KNOWLEDGE- AND SO I THINK

03:49:04.030 --> 03:49:05.631
THAT'S- IF THERE'S ANY IF

03:49:05.698 --> 03:49:08.434
THERE'S ANY SILVER LINING TO

03:49:08.501 --> 03:49:09.001
THIS VERY DARK CLOUD THAT'S

03:49:09.068 --> 03:49:10.303
WHAT I THINK IT IS. APPRECIATE

03:49:10.369 --> 03:49:12.338
YOUR PERSPECTIVE I AM. THAT

03:49:12.405 --> 03:49:13.673
THAT CLOUT DOESN'T HAVE A

03:49:13.739 --> 03:49:15.308
SILVER LINING FOR ME SO. THANK

03:49:15.374 --> 03:49:20.446
YOU- DR STONE AND IN A NUMBER

03:49:20.513 --> 03:49:22.915
MR RESEARCH HAS QUESTION SO- DO

03:49:22.982 --> 03:49:25.785
YOU DO YOU EXPECT UP CONGRESS

03:49:25.852 --> 03:49:27.787
TO ACT QUICKLY. ON ANYTHING. I

03:49:27.854 --> 03:49:29.989
DON'T KNOW I WAS JUST TRYING TO

03:49:30.056 --> 03:49:32.592
FIGURE THAT OUT THIS MORNING-

03:49:32.658 --> 03:49:35.962
YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE. WE MAY

03:49:36.028 --> 03:49:39.732
GET CHILD CARE. AND I MEAN

03:49:39.799 --> 03:49:40.700
THAT'S THE WHOLE QUESTION OF

03:49:40.766 --> 03:49:42.635
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

03:49:42.702 --> 03:49:45.271
RECONCILIATION BILL. WHERE SITE

03:49:45.338 --> 03:49:47.340
WORRY ON THE WORK FORCE SIDE

03:49:47.406 --> 03:49:47.807
BECAUSE WE HAVE A HUGE

03:49:47.874 --> 03:49:49.909
INVESTMENT. FOUR HUNDRED

03:49:49.976 --> 03:49:53.546
BILLION FOR HCV ALISON WE'VE

03:49:53.613 --> 03:49:54.413
ACTUALLY BEEN TRYING TO MAKE

03:49:54.480 --> 03:49:55.715
SURE THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY

03:49:55.781 --> 03:49:57.316
EXPAND OUT TO OTHER SETTINGS

03:49:57.383 --> 03:49:58.684
THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE

03:49:58.751 --> 03:50:00.052
CUT BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

03:50:00.119 --> 03:50:01.654
IT'S GOING TO BE CUT THE OTHER

03:50:01.721 --> 03:50:04.023
THING THAT WE WORK ON. IN OUR

03:50:04.090 --> 03:50:05.558
GROUP IS AFFORDABLE SENIOR

03:50:05.625 --> 03:50:06.792
HOUSING BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT

03:50:06.859 --> 03:50:08.194
OF AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING

03:50:08.261 --> 03:50:09.762
PROVIDERS AND LEADING AGE AND

03:50:09.829 --> 03:50:11.330
THAT IT MAY BE ON THE CUTTING

03:50:11.397 --> 03:50:14.567
BOARD AS WELL SO- I WISH I

03:50:14.634 --> 03:50:16.469
COULD TELL YOU I HAVE NO IDEA-

03:50:16.536 --> 03:50:18.304
WE NONE OF OUR POLICY PEOPLE

03:50:18.371 --> 03:50:20.306
KNOW ANYMORE THAN THOSE OF US

03:50:20.373 --> 03:50:22.508
WHO READ THE NEWSPAPER-

03:50:22.575 --> 03:50:24.277
SOMETHING I'LL COME OUT OF

03:50:24.343 --> 03:50:27.046
CONGRESS- WHAT WHAT ENDS UP

03:50:27.113 --> 03:50:28.481
GETTING CUT OF COURSE THE TRUTH

03:50:28.548 --> 03:50:29.682
OF THE MATTER IS IF WE GET A

03:50:29.749 --> 03:50:32.385
CHILD CARE. BENEFIT THIS HELPS

03:50:32.451 --> 03:50:35.188
OUR FRONTLINE CARE

03:50:35.254 --> 03:50:35.755
PROFESSIONALS BECAUSE THAT'S

03:50:35.821 --> 03:50:37.957
ONE OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEY

03:50:38.024 --> 03:50:39.091
NEED AND IT'S EXTREMELY

03:50:39.158 --> 03:50:40.259
VARIABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT

03:50:40.326 --> 03:50:42.028
ACCESS TO VOTE THROUGH THOSE

03:50:42.094 --> 03:50:43.129
TYPES OF BENEFITS THEY GET

03:50:43.196 --> 03:50:44.997
THROUGH THE NURSING HOME THESE

03:50:45.064 --> 03:50:46.766
DAYS SO ON THE CHILD CARE

03:50:46.832 --> 03:50:49.735
BENEFIT WOULD HELP- FAMILY

03:50:49.802 --> 03:50:52.705
MEDICAL LEAVE WOULD HELP- SO

03:50:52.772 --> 03:50:55.908
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS- GREAT

03:50:55.975 --> 03:50:57.543
THANK YOU THANK YOU I DID WANT

03:50:57.610 --> 03:50:59.612
TO SAY ONE OTHER THING THAT

03:50:59.679 --> 03:51:02.582
LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION

03:51:02.648 --> 03:51:03.616
AROUND- NO I DON'T. DON'T THINK

03:51:03.683 --> 03:51:06.118
IT'S AN EITHER OR WE NEED WE

03:51:06.185 --> 03:51:10.056
NEED REGULATION- MY FORTY PLUS

03:51:10.122 --> 03:51:12.858
YEARS OF THIS AND- LOOKING AT A

03:51:12.925 --> 03:51:15.861
LOT OF STATES. HAS TO DO WITH

03:51:15.928 --> 03:51:18.564
THE QUESTION OF. WHERE SHOULD

03:51:18.631 --> 03:51:21.000
WE INVEST IN A REGULATORY

03:51:21.067 --> 03:51:23.903
PROCESS AND WHERE DO WE NEED

03:51:23.970 --> 03:51:26.005
SOMETHING ELSE THAT BOTH HAS

03:51:26.072 --> 03:51:27.673
CARROTS AND STICKS ATTACHED TO

03:51:27.740 --> 03:51:31.010
IT AND I DO THINK THAT WE NEED

03:51:31.077 --> 03:51:33.846
WE NEED A PROCESS A REGULATORY

03:51:33.913 --> 03:51:36.382
PROCESS THAT DOES NOT ALLOW-

03:51:36.449 --> 03:51:38.150
THESE BAD ACTORS I THINK IT'S

03:51:38.217 --> 03:51:40.353
REALLY HARD IN THIS. KIND OF A

03:51:40.419 --> 03:51:43.055
SOCIETY FOR THE INDUSTRY ITSELF

03:51:43.122 --> 03:51:44.890
TO REGULATE THOSE GUYS OUT

03:51:44.957 --> 03:51:46.492
ALTHOUGH I THINK THE MORE THAT

03:51:46.559 --> 03:51:47.727
WE GET TO A HIGHER QUALITY

03:51:47.793 --> 03:51:49.128
SYSTEM THE BETTER IT'S GOING TO

03:51:49.195 --> 03:51:50.463
BE FOR ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWING

03:51:50.529 --> 03:51:53.165
THOSE TIES IN TO BEGIN WITH.

03:51:53.232 --> 03:51:54.767
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE COULD

03:51:54.834 --> 03:51:57.136
USE A THINK ABOUT A REGULATORY

03:51:57.203 --> 03:52:00.473
APPROACH THAT HAS A LITTLE BIT

03:52:00.539 --> 03:52:03.242
MORE OF A- CARROT AND STICK

03:52:03.309 --> 03:52:05.177
APPROACH WITHIN IT OKAY FOR

03:52:05.244 --> 03:52:07.246
PERFORMANCE. ACTIVITY THAT

03:52:07.313 --> 03:52:09.115
REALLY UNDERSTANDS HOW DO YOU

03:52:09.181 --> 03:52:10.950
MEASURE GOOD QUALITY HOW DO YOU

03:52:11.017 --> 03:52:13.119
AUDIT GOOD QUALITY. I MEAN IT'S

03:52:13.185 --> 03:52:15.521
GREAT TO HAVE STAFFING RATIOS

03:52:15.588 --> 03:52:16.522
BUT THAT'S THE TIP OF THE

03:52:16.589 --> 03:52:19.058
ICEBERG. IN OUR ORGANIZATIONS

03:52:19.125 --> 03:52:19.892
WE NEED TO HOLD THESE

03:52:19.959 --> 03:52:21.927
ORGANIZATIONS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:52:21.994 --> 03:52:24.163
HOW THEY DELIVER CARE EVERY

03:52:24.230 --> 03:52:26.065
SINGLE DAY. WHAT ARE THEIR WORK

03:52:26.132 --> 03:52:28.734
PROCESSES YOU KNOW THIS HAPPENS

03:52:28.801 --> 03:52:30.536
IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. IT HAPPENS

03:52:30.603 --> 03:52:32.538
IN THE ERROR IN THE AIRPLANE

03:52:32.605 --> 03:52:34.640
INDUSTRY. AND WE DON'T HAVE

03:52:34.707 --> 03:52:36.609
THAT SAME TYPE OF APPROACH OF

03:52:36.676 --> 03:52:39.011
OVERSIGHT AND AUDITING AND I

03:52:39.078 --> 03:52:40.079
THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING A

03:52:40.146 --> 03:52:41.981
LOT MORE AT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

03:52:42.048 --> 03:52:43.849
BLACK BOX WITH IN. THE NURSING

03:52:43.916 --> 03:52:45.451
HOME AND I THINK DR STEINBERG

03:52:45.518 --> 03:52:46.619
WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH ME

03:52:46.686 --> 03:52:48.654
THAT IT'S ALL DEVIL IN THE

03:52:48.721 --> 03:52:50.323
DETAILS AND IN TERMS OF WHAT

03:52:50.389 --> 03:52:53.225
HAPPENS THERE'S TOO MUCH

03:52:53.292 --> 03:52:55.561
MEDIOCRITY FOR ME. THAT IS THE

03:52:55.628 --> 03:52:57.730
PROBLEM. ASIDE FROM THESE BAD

03:52:57.797 --> 03:52:59.498
APPLES. I THINK WE OUGHT TO

03:52:59.565 --> 03:53:03.069
RAISE THE BAR. TO AT LEAST

03:53:03.135 --> 03:53:05.738
85290% FOR ALL NURSING HOMES.

03:53:05.805 --> 03:53:06.872
AND THEN I WOULD BE HAPPY.

03:53:06.939 --> 03:53:10.343
THANK YOU THANK YOU DR STONE

03:53:10.409 --> 03:53:12.978
THE SUMMER CITY THANK YOU- DR

03:53:13.045 --> 03:53:18.184
STONE I- ONE THING I'VE LEARNED

03:53:18.250 --> 03:53:21.320
FROM- LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE

03:53:21.387 --> 03:53:22.988
NURSING HOME INDUSTRY IS THAT I

03:53:23.055 --> 03:53:25.024
CONSISTENTLY HEAR THE- THAT IF

03:53:25.091 --> 03:53:25.858
YOU EVER HAVE TO GO TO A

03:53:25.925 --> 03:53:27.493
NURSING HOME LOOK FOR A

03:53:27.560 --> 03:53:31.831
NONPROFIT NURSING HOME. AND.

03:53:31.897 --> 03:53:36.168
AND THAT GUY IT APPEARS THE

03:53:36.235 --> 03:53:37.970
DATA APPEARS TO SHOW THAT THAT

03:53:38.037 --> 03:53:39.605
THERE ARE THERE ARE HIGHER

03:53:39.672 --> 03:53:42.108
QUALITY OF CARE IN THE

03:53:42.174 --> 03:53:44.477
NONPROFIT TO- OF THE FACILITIES

03:53:44.543 --> 03:53:46.045
IN GENERAL LIKE OF COURSE I'M

03:53:46.112 --> 03:53:47.747
SURE THERE ARE THERE ARE-

03:53:47.813 --> 03:53:49.782
WONDERFUL FOR PROFIT TO.

03:53:49.849 --> 03:53:53.352
NURSING HOMES YEAH BUT- GUY I

03:53:53.419 --> 03:53:55.621
WANT TO ASK YOU I MEAN. THANK

03:53:55.688 --> 03:53:59.859
YOUNG. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR-

03:53:59.925 --> 03:54:03.596
OPINION AS TO- A NURSING HOME-

03:54:03.662 --> 03:54:05.431
OWNER WHOSE LICENSE IS PENDING-

03:54:05.498 --> 03:54:07.500
DENIED- I HAD SHOULD SHOULD

03:54:07.566 --> 03:54:09.301
SHOULD SUCH A NURSING HOME

03:54:09.368 --> 03:54:11.937
OWNER- BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE

03:54:12.004 --> 03:54:15.808
TO OPERATE. THIS IS MY-

03:54:15.875 --> 03:54:16.308
PERSONAL OPINION I'M NOT

03:54:16.375 --> 03:54:18.778
SPEAKING FOR. WAITING AGE OR

03:54:18.844 --> 03:54:20.579
ANY OTHER ENTITY BUT I'VE BEEN

03:54:20.646 --> 03:54:23.315
AROUND A LONG TIME AND- NO I

03:54:23.382 --> 03:54:24.784
DON'T THINK THAT SOMEONE WHO

03:54:24.850 --> 03:54:26.419
HAS HAD A LICENSE DENIED SHOULD

03:54:26.485 --> 03:54:29.188
BE. ACCESSING ON THE OTHER HAND

03:54:29.255 --> 03:54:30.956
THERE ARE ALSO THE WHOLE

03:54:31.023 --> 03:54:32.658
QUESTION OF WHAT WAS RAISED

03:54:32.725 --> 03:54:35.795
AROUND INTERIM. WHAT HAPPENS TO

03:54:35.861 --> 03:54:37.463
ALL THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THESE

03:54:37.530 --> 03:54:39.765
FACILITIES IF YOU DON'T HAVE

03:54:39.832 --> 03:54:41.467
SOMEBODY OWNING IT. THE

03:54:41.534 --> 03:54:43.769
INSTABILITY OF STAFF WHICH IS

03:54:43.836 --> 03:54:45.304
HORRIBLE TO BEGIN WITH ITS

03:54:45.371 --> 03:54:46.639
WORST I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THIS

03:54:46.705 --> 03:54:48.808
AND WE SEE A LOT MORE TURNOVER

03:54:48.874 --> 03:54:50.376
NOW AND CHURNING OF THESE

03:54:50.443 --> 03:54:51.177
NURSING HOMES THAN WE'VE SEEN

03:54:51.243 --> 03:54:54.346
IN THE PAST. IT IS HORRIFIC FOR

03:54:54.413 --> 03:54:56.782
THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE SO.

03:54:56.849 --> 03:54:57.683
I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN EASY

03:54:57.750 --> 03:55:00.653
ANSWER- SO I BUT I BUT I DO

03:55:00.719 --> 03:55:03.456
THINK AGAIN IF WE HELD A

03:55:03.522 --> 03:55:05.524
STANDARD. WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE

03:55:05.591 --> 03:55:07.827
BE REQUIRING OF ALL OWNERS

03:55:07.893 --> 03:55:10.629
LICENSE ALL ADMINISTRATORS. OF

03:55:10.696 --> 03:55:14.567
ALL NURSES. 60% OF ONE OF THE

03:55:14.633 --> 03:55:16.001
ORGANIZATIONS THAT I AM ON THE

03:55:16.068 --> 03:55:19.104
BOARD OF A NONPROFIT NURSING

03:55:19.171 --> 03:55:22.508
HOME AND CARE ORGANIZATION AND

03:55:22.575 --> 03:55:24.944
I WILL NOT NAME. I KNOW FIRST

03:55:25.010 --> 03:55:27.146
COMMAND AND DID A STUDY OF WELL

03:55:27.213 --> 03:55:30.449
THE NURSE COMPETENCIES 60% OF

03:55:30.516 --> 03:55:32.384
THOSE NURSES FAILED. YOUR

03:55:32.451 --> 03:55:35.020
COMPETENCIES AND THEY ARE

03:55:35.087 --> 03:55:36.956
IDENTIFIED AS A FAIRLY DECENT

03:55:37.022 --> 03:55:40.025
ORGANIZATION. AND THIS IS

03:55:40.092 --> 03:55:42.628
BECAUSE WE DO NOT INVEST IN THE

03:55:42.695 --> 03:55:45.664
QUALITY OF OUR STAFF SO ARE YOU

03:55:45.731 --> 03:55:48.234
KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THIS PART OF

03:55:48.300 --> 03:55:49.835
IT IT'S THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

03:55:49.902 --> 03:55:51.070
TO WORK DO YOUR WINDOWS ARE

03:55:51.136 --> 03:55:52.805
THEY PRACTICING TO THE HIGHEST

03:55:52.872 --> 03:55:54.340
LEVEL OUR OUR FRONT GOING

03:55:54.406 --> 03:55:56.408
NURSES ARE LPNS DO THEY KNOW

03:55:56.475 --> 03:55:57.343
WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE DOING I

03:55:57.409 --> 03:55:59.311
DID A STUDY IN CALIFORNIA IT

03:55:59.378 --> 03:56:01.447
WAS SCARY TO ME. I TO

03:56:01.514 --> 03:56:03.883
NONPROFITS TO FOR PROFITS IN

03:56:03.949 --> 03:56:05.417
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WE

03:56:05.484 --> 03:56:06.685
WERE VALUE WAITING BECAUSE WE

03:56:06.752 --> 03:56:09.522
DEVELOP THE NURSE TRAINING

03:56:09.588 --> 03:56:10.523
PROGRAM THERE. IT'S THE LEVEL

03:56:10.589 --> 03:56:12.658
LACK OF INVESTMENT I MEAN I

03:56:12.725 --> 03:56:14.593
DON'T WANT TO GET DR STEINBERG

03:56:14.660 --> 03:56:16.328
INVOLVED IN THIS BUT YOU KNOW

03:56:16.395 --> 03:56:17.997
THOSE OF US WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:56:18.063 --> 03:56:20.099
IT MEANS TO DO GOOD CARE.

03:56:20.165 --> 03:56:22.034
UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN IN THE

03:56:22.101 --> 03:56:23.802
BETTER ORGANIZATIONS IF YOU

03:56:23.869 --> 03:56:25.137
DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TRAINED AND

03:56:25.204 --> 03:56:27.306
SUPPORTED ON AN ONGOING BASIS

03:56:27.373 --> 03:56:28.674
YOU CAN'T PRODUCE GREAT

03:56:28.741 --> 03:56:30.442
QUALITY. THAT'S WHAT I LOOK FOR

03:56:30.509 --> 03:56:32.878
WHEN I GO TO A NURSING HOME NOT

03:56:32.945 --> 03:56:33.546
JUST THAT THEY'RE NOT FOR

03:56:33.612 --> 03:56:36.282
PROFIT. SO THERE'S SOME CRAPPIE.

03:56:36.348 --> 03:56:38.217
IT'S IN THIS WORLD. BUT THAT

03:56:38.284 --> 03:56:39.718
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE STAFF WHO

03:56:39.785 --> 03:56:41.854
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. OKAY

03:56:41.921 --> 03:56:44.557
AND- YEAH SO YOU KNOW I WOULD

03:56:44.623 --> 03:56:46.158
JUST SAY THAT WE NEED TO BE

03:56:46.225 --> 03:56:48.827
PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT AND-

03:56:48.894 --> 03:56:49.361
IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE A

03:56:49.428 --> 03:56:52.331
LICENSE. THEY SHOULD BE

03:56:52.398 --> 03:56:53.832
PRACTICING ALL RIGHT LAST

03:56:53.899 --> 03:56:55.834
QUESTION TO ADOPT STONED AND

03:56:55.901 --> 03:56:58.704
TO- IS THE PRACTICE OF. OF IT-

03:56:58.771 --> 03:57:00.072
USING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

03:57:00.139 --> 03:57:01.540
RELATED PARTIES IS THAT ALSO

03:57:01.607 --> 03:57:03.809
PREVALENT IN THE AMONG

03:57:03.876 --> 03:57:05.611
NONPROFIT NURSING HOMES. NOT

03:57:37.710 --> 03:57:38.978
THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES.

03:57:39.044 --> 03:57:40.312
RECOGNIZING COVE IT WAS

03:57:40.379 --> 03:57:42.948
DIFFICULT FOR ALL OF US- YOU

03:57:43.015 --> 03:57:45.584
KNOW PART OF MY- CONCERN AND-

03:57:45.651 --> 03:57:47.753
COMMENTS IS- YOU HAVE A MOTHER

03:57:47.820 --> 03:57:48.654
WHO LIVES IN ASSISTED LIVING IN

03:57:48.721 --> 03:57:50.956
WASHINGTON. THEY DID A FABULOUS

03:57:51.023 --> 03:57:53.959
JOB EARLY ON. AND THEY DIDN'T

03:57:54.026 --> 03:57:55.961
HAVE CASES THAT I'M AWARE OF IN

03:57:56.028 --> 03:57:59.665
HER FACILITY. NONE THEY HAD A

03:57:59.732 --> 03:58:01.400
COUPLE STAFF PEOPLE WHO WERE

03:58:01.467 --> 03:58:02.267
TAKING UP BUT THEY HAD NO

03:58:02.334 --> 03:58:04.303
RESIDENTS THAT I'M AWARE OF

03:58:04.370 --> 03:58:07.573
THAT HAD AND THERE'S A COUPLE

03:58:07.640 --> 03:58:08.207
HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE

03:58:08.273 --> 03:58:10.442
FACILITY THEY REACTED QUICKLY

03:58:10.509 --> 03:58:14.313
EARLY- WE DIDN'T REACT AS

03:58:14.380 --> 03:58:16.682
QUICKLY- IN CALIFORNIA WE

03:58:16.749 --> 03:58:19.284
DIDN'T REACT AS EARLY- EVEN

03:58:19.351 --> 03:58:20.753
THOUGH WE HAD THE EXAMPLE OF

03:58:20.819 --> 03:58:22.755
WHAT WAS HAPPENING WASHINGTON-

03:58:22.821 --> 03:58:25.391
BEFORE US. AND SO THAT'S MY

03:58:25.457 --> 03:58:27.359
FRUSTRATION AND THAT'S WHERE

03:58:27.426 --> 03:58:29.061
I'M COMING FROM WHEN I WHEN I

03:58:29.128 --> 03:58:31.730
TALK ABOUT THAT. WE ARE SENIORS

03:58:31.797 --> 03:58:33.298
ARE CHRONICALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS

03:58:33.365 --> 03:58:34.233
AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

03:58:34.299 --> 03:58:35.868
HAVE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY

03:58:35.934 --> 03:58:38.637
MORE DURING COVERT- COBIT

03:58:38.704 --> 03:58:40.372
CANNOT BE AN EXCUSE TO NOT DO

03:58:40.439 --> 03:58:45.377
BETTER. I RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW

WELL YOU KNOW WITH COCA. AND I

03:58:55.854 --> 03:58:57.089
THINK WE'RE BETTER THAN THAT I

03:58:57.156 --> 03:58:58.590
THINK THAT'S WHEN YOU DIG IN

03:58:58.657 --> 03:58:59.458
YOUR HEELS THAT'S WHEN YOU GET

03:58:59.525 --> 03:59:01.493

03:59:01.560 --> 03:59:04.563
HEART TO WORK HARDER- NOT

03:59:04.630 --> 03:59:06.765
EXCUSES. WE DON'T NEED EXCUSES
