I THANK YOU MISTER AND THE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE YOU TO PRESENT THIS BILL INTO PLANNING BILL THAT ESTABLISHES STATEWIDE PROTECTIVE STANDARDS FOR COMMUNITIES IN FIRE RISK AREAS AS YOU MENTIONED THE BILL IS HERE BECAUSE THERE WERE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE HOUSING ASPECT OF THOSE AMENDMENTS FURTHER ELABORATED THE FRAMEWORK FOR HOW RINA ALLOCATION AND THE RAIN ALLOCATION PROCESS SHOULD CONSIDER THE FIRE RISK. OF THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT THOSE COMMANDMENTS AND AS SUCH I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER MOVING THE BILL TO THE SENATE FLOOR SO THAT IT MAY BE RETURNED TO THE ASSEMBLY FOR FURTHER ACTION WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT A WORKING GROUP WILL BE CONVENE TO WITH RELEVANT PARTIES AND STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING BUT NOT NECESSARILY LIMITED TO THOSE FROM THIS COMMITTEE.
