CAN CALL. A MR Y. KOWSKI WE WOULD LIKE TO START. OUR COMMITTEE AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AS WE WAIT TO HAVE MEMBERS CONTINUE. YOU ALL CAN KEEP TALKING IF YOU LIVE AS I MENTIONED THE COMMITTEE ON US ON ON UTILITIES AND ENERGY WILL. OF PERCY WE ARE WAITING FOR A QUORUM WE ARE TOO SHY OF A QUORUM INTHE WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE OUR OUR FIRST PRESENTATION TODAY THIS IS FILE ITEM. NUMBER THREE SB SEVEN EIGHTY TWO SKINNER THIS IS ENERGY DATA TRANSPARENCY BILL. WELCOME CENTER. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I'M SB SEVEN EIGHTY TO THE PORTION THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY -- YOU INEFFECTIVE ALREADY VOTED ON ENDED MY BILL LAST YEAR S. B. THREE FIFTY SIX THERE WAS. WHAT'S CONTAINED IN S. B. SEVEN EIGHTY TWO PLUS A WHAT WAS CONSIDERED MORE CONTROVERSIAL -- ISSUES AROUND GRID LEVEL DATA. AND FOR THE GRID LEVEL DATA ASPECT WAS THE PART THAT SEEM TO GIVE FOLKS THE MOST DIFFICULTY SO I'VE REMOVED THE GRID LEVEL DATA. ENTIRELY. AND THIS IS THE NON CONTROVERSIAL PORTIONS OF S. F. THAT BILL. AND WHAT THIS BILLS FOCUSED ON ONLY IS DATA RELATED TO BUILDINGS AND GIVING A LITTLE MORE ACT MORE. AT BILL WOULD BE FOR OWNERSHIP BUILDINGS AND OTHERS TO ACCESS THE ENERGY USE DATA IN THAT BUILDING SO THAT THEY CAN THEN APPROPRIATELY MAKE ASSESSMENTS AROUND INVESTMENTS IN EFFICIENCY UPGRADES. AND OTHER SUCH WORK [inaudible] SO -- I AM ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE DETAILED IN THE ANALYSIS BEN I'D LIKE MY PRESENTERS TO PRESENT AND THAN IN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR IF NECESSARY I CAN DESCRIBE THE THREE ELEMENTS THAT ARE REMAIN IN THE BILL. I WILL LET [inaudible] QUIET. HI GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I MY NAME IS MARION PARTISAN I'M WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. I'M WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE SPELL AS SENATOR SKYNYRD SAID IT IS A SENSIBLE -- UPDATE TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO MAKE IT A REALLY A FUNCTIONAL. A BILL AND ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION TO BUILDING OWNERS THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE INVESTMENT. DECISIONS AND ALSO FINANCE INVESTMENTS. I'M SO AB EIGHT A THREE TO PASSED A THREE YEARS AGO IT TOOK A HUGE STEP FORWARD TO TO GIVE MULTI FAMILY BUILDING OWNERS ACCESS TO HOLD BUILDING DATA AGAIN SO THEY CAN MAKE THE SENSIBLE INVESTMENT DECISIONS. THERE'S THREE WAYS AT THIS BILL IS GOING TO CLEAN UP ON NATO TO SO THAT ITS REALLY USABLE -- THE FIRST IS THAT THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE ISSUES AROUND THE USE OF THE TERM A BUILDING AS OPPOSED TO PROPERTY. AND WE USE THE TERM THAT BILL USES THE TERM BUILDING AND IN FACT THERE'S A NUMBER OF A MULTI FAMILY PROPERTIES THAT HAVE SMALL GARDEN APARTMENTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE AYE MULTI FAMILY PROPERTIES ARE ABLE TO BE AGGREGATED AND THOSE PROPERTIES CAN RECEIVE. ENERGY EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS AND BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF THE CURRENT ENERGY USE IN THE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE MADE TO MAKE THOSE ON UNITS MORE EFFICIENT. I'M SECOND AB IT ARE TWO DID NOT REQUIRE THE CC TO ESTABLISH A BUILDING IDENTIFIER FOR EACH BUILDING. ON THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A VENN NUMBER I'M FOR VEHICLE SO THAT THOSE LARGER PROPERTIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PUBLICLY BENCHMARK THEIR DATA ENERGY USE. CAN -- MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE MEET THE ALL THE DIFFERENT. IT MAY SEEM LIKE -- SURPRISING THAT THIS ISN'T THAT DISTANCE MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT SHOULD BE. BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE BUILDING IN THE STATE WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND WE KNOW WHICH BILLS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BE ASSOCIATED. WITH THOSE PROPERTIES SO PRETTY -- IMPORTANT FACT -- AND THE THE THIRD PIECE -- BUT THAT'S IT SO DOES BOTH SORT OF THE MAIN ISSUES ON WITH THE BILL THAT THE COMPELLED CLEANED UP [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR JEREMIAH JUSTIN FANS ALL SITTING IN FOR ANDREA DEVOTE TECH THAT'S ENERGY EXPERT BUT HOPEFULLY I CAN PROVIDE YOU A QUICK EASY TESTIMONY. LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR ALL OF HER WORK ON THIS IN THE COMMITTEE'S WORK THREAD THE NEEDLE OUT WE BELIEVE THE BILL AUTHORS -- MEASURED APPROACH TO PROVIDING EFFICIENCIES -- TO ON ENERGY DATA THAT WILL ULTIMATELY ALLOW COMPANIES TO BENEFIT FROM -- ALL THIS DATA THAT IS GIVING US TOWARDS OUR ENERGY GOALS AND OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS WE ASK IS POSSIBLE. TECH. THANK YOU WILL NOW WELCOME BACK ANY ELSE ANYONE ELSE FROM THE PUBLIC WHO'S HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST OF MANY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY AND STRONG SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS ANIMAL REPRESENTING THE EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL ALSO IN SUPPORT. CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON OF FERRERO WITH THE SCHOOL ENERGY COALITION IN SUPPORT THINKING. I WILL TAKE A TESTIMONY FROM TWO WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE THE MEASURE. GOOD MORNING. OR GOOD AFTERNOON. THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS PATRICK WHAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA SP TILDES ASSOCIATION. AYE WE ARE OPPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION. ON SEVEN EIGHTY TO BELIEVE THERE ARE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS WITH AB EIGHT OF TO WHICH JUST STARTED BEING IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR. AND WE BELIEVE AT THIS POINT TIME THAT ADDING AN ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS ON TOP OF WHAT'S FORTY GOING ON ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF COMPLEXITY. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT IT UNDERTAKING THAT OUR MEMBERS WILL HAVE TO DO AND AND IT'S JUST ANOTHER LAYER OF COMPLEXITY ON RT BURDENSOME. AND FRANKLY NOT A SMOOTH PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON SO FAR WITH AB EIGHT OF TO BE OF SIMILAR AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR AND SOME OF THEM ALSO TO THE COMMITTEE. THAT WE THINK RESULTS IN THOSE IMPLEMENTATION CONCERT. FLEXIBLE FOR THOSE UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT AND THE PROVISIONS OF AB EIGHT HOW TO AND AND THEN AT SB SEVEN EIGHTY TWO AS WELL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL TAKE A IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY IT'S A I AS A NO POSITION ELECT TAKE A MINUTE OR SO. PART NOT JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. TECH LADEN STING ON BEHALF OF BY SENIOR WAY WE'RE ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS MANY POSITION OUT SHARED AMENDMENTS WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE FOUR TO WORKING WITH HER THANK YOU. SARAH TO HARRY WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY AGAIN ECHOING THE COMMENTS I'VE SEEN YOU AND MISTER WELCH SALAS MUD AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING. DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHERS OFFICE AND APPRECIATE OTHER CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE NO OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION WE WILL TURN TO MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENT -- SOON AS WE GET ONE THAT THE MOTION WILL BE IN ORDER. A SENATOR WE APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND CONTINUED ONGOING LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA -- EFFICIENCY AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON THIS AND SO HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO BE IN A POSITION. TO ATTEMPT TO PASS AS AMENDED. AND SO SOON AS WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL LOOK FOR A MOTION. AND I TAKE ACTION ON YOUR BILL. THANKS SO MUCH APPRECIATED AND IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING. OF LIKE TO MAKE FROM I THINK WE WASN'T DESCRIBED IS THAT WERE ALSO -- ALLOWING FOR WHAT'S CALLED AN E. SIGNATURE INSTEAD OF A WET SIGNATURE. TO PROVIDE THIRD PARTY ACCESS TO DATA WHICH WAS ARE REQUESTED BY AND VARIOUS THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AYE FOLKS SO -- THAT'S ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT THE BILL BUT WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN APPRECIATE THE CLOCKS WORK IN THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT YOU'RE WELCOME [inaudible] THANK YOU. SENATOR IF YOU LIKE TO PAUSE FOR A MINUTE [inaudible] SENATOR.

CONSENT CALENDAR ITEMS ARE ALL APPROVED WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE MEMBERS TO ADD ON I WILL NOW TURN TO FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE SB SIXTY FOUR WIECKOWSKI THIS IS -- YOUR OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ON FOSSIL FUEL GENERATION UNITS WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SIDE SENATE BILL SIXTY FOUR ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM THAT'S ALREADY STARTED TO OCCUR. AND COULD BECOME WORSE IN THE FUTURE EVERYDAY FOSSIL FUEL UNITS ARE BEING CYCLE THE UP TO A BACKUP RENEWABLE ENERGY IN IN THE FUTURE THESE UNITS ARE LIKELY TO BE A CYCLE. MORE OFTEN AND MORE OFTEN AND MORE OFTEN WHEN A FOSSIL FUEL UP PLANTS START AND CYCLE THEY COMMIT CAN EMIT UP TO THIRTY EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH POLLUTION AS WHEN A UNIT. IS OPERATED UNDER A STEADY. STATE IF WE DO NOT START TO ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL HERE IMPACTS ON OUR CHANGING ELECTRIC GRID OUR AIR QUALITY IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE COULD GET WORSE. EVEN AS WE MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS AND RENEWABLE REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU TAKES THE FIRST STEP IN STARTING TO CONSIDER THOSE IMPACTS BY REQUIRING MORE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATA. TRACK THE CHANGING PROFILE OF THE GRID. AN ANALYSIS OF THE AIR QUALITY IMPACTS BY LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS OF THE INCREASED CYCLING EMISSIONS AND FINALLY A STUDY ON HOW BEST TO TRANSITION OUR GRID TO GREEN FUTURE THAT GUY PROTECTS AIR QUALITY. SO LET'S LOOK AT THE ACCESSIBLE DATA THE FIRST PART OF THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT A CALIFORNIA WEBSITE INCLUDE ACCESSIBLE DATA THAT SHOWS THE CHANGES AND STARTS STOPS AND CYCLING OVER TIME. INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND DATA RELATED TO HOW POWER PLANTS ARE OPERATING IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP IN A MEANINGFUL A DECISION MAKING PROCESS. UP NOW ALTHOUGH THE USEPA HAS HOURLY EMISSION DATA AVAILABLE RELATED TO POWER PLANTS. THIS DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW ON A CALIFORNIA WEBSITE. AND IT TAKES A REALLY SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS I THINK YOU NEED A SLIDE RULE TRANSLATE INTO ACCEPTABLE DATA SHOWING CHANGES OVER TIME. WE'VE CHANGE THIS FIRST PROVISION TO REQUIRED OF FACILITIES TO DIRECTLY SUBMIT THEIR DATA TO CARVE THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD RATHER THAN THE BALANCING AUTHORITIES WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CHANGE RESPONSE TO CONCERNS FROM BALANCING AUTHORITIES. IN THIS NEW LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN THE PARALLEL THE U. S. EPA'S REQUIREMENTS SO THAT EACH OF THE FACILITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONSENT CARP AND CAN THE SEND THE U. S. EPA THE QUARTERLY ADMISSION DATA SETS TOGETHER. SO THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL THE ADDRESSES ANALYSIS OF AIR QUALITY IMPACTS. AND FIRST I WANT TO NOTE THAT IN ARM AMENDMENTS WE'VE ADDRESSED THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS BY TAKING OUT PREVIOUS PROVISIONS RELATING TO PERMIT LIMITATIONS THAT IMPACT DISPATCH. THAT GOT EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT ADDRESSING THIS DISPATCH IN A MEANINGFUL WAY IS IMPORTANT WE THINK MORE DATA AND DISCUSSION THIS NECESSARY DEFERRED TO DEVELOP THAT CONCEPT. NOW OUR ANALYSIS OF YOUR CALL THE IMPACTS IS NOW LIVE IT IS JUST TWO SECTIONS THE FIRST SECTION SEE REQUIRES THAT AIR DISTRICTS TO DETERMINE THE ACTUAL EMISSIONS OF POWER PLANTS DUE TO THE CYCLING. THIS INFORMATION IS AND ISN'T IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARDS ASSESSING THIS ISSUE IT WILL BE USEFUL TO US INFORMATION BUT THEN THIS WILL INFORM THIS IF THIS FORM FORMER STAR STUDY OF THE FLEET AND AND HOW WHAT THE FINAL SECTION OF THE ABOUT BILL IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE OTHER SECTION RELATES TO THE ANALYSIS IN SECTION VI WHICH REQUIRES AIR DISTRICTS TO LOOK. AT THE ACTUAL IMPACT TO LOOK TO THE ACTUAL IMPACTS AT YOUR QUALITY -- ON THE CHANGING OF CYCLING IN THAT IN THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THIS CONSIDERATION IS ESSENTIAL AYE FOR ENSURING THAT THE IMPACTS OF THIS CHANGE IN THE CYCLING IS UNDERSTOOD. THIS BILL DOES NOT THAT EXTEND THEIR CHANGE CURRENT HERE DISTRICT PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS HE SAID IT AGAIN THIS BILL DOES NOT. DAD CHANGER ALTER CURRENT AIR DISTRICT -- PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS RATHER IT REQUIRES THAT THE YEAR DISTRICTS. BLESSEDLY EVALUATE THIS OPERATIONAL CHANGE AS WE ARE SAYING FARM FORTS IMPACT ON AMBIENT AIR WITHIN THEIR CURRENT PERMITTING AUTHORITIES AND FINALLY THE STUDY. HOW THE WE TRANSITION OUR FLEET THE BILL THIS BILL REQUIRES A STUDY ON HOW TO PRIORITIZE TO REDUCTION OF THE USAGE AND EVENTUAL RETIREMENT OF NATURAL GAS FACILITIES MOST IMPACTING THE AIR QUALITY OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES? AND COMMUNITIES BREATHING UNHEALTHY AIR THIS STUDY IS NOW IN THE THE STATE'S NEEDED RIGHT NOW. GAS PLANTS ARE ALREADY THREATENING TO RETIRE ACROSS THE STATE BUT THERE'S NO PLAN ON HOW THIS SHOULD OCCUR WITHOUT ANY STEADY WE COULD END UP WITH INCREASE POLLUTION FROM POWER PLANTS IN AREAS WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY. THIS STUDY WILL GIVE US THE INFORMATION TO HELP OUR INFORMANT ORDERLY AND EQUITABLE TRANSITION TO THE GREEN. A GREAT. NOW. YOU WILL HEALTHCARE FROM OPPOSITION. I SAID DISCUSSED ARE JUST NOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ARGUMENTS BY THE OPPOSITION HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE REMOVAL OF A SEPARATE THE SEAS <u>&lt;c.green&gt; IN&lt;/c&gt;</u> SEPARATE SEIZE F.. THE CHANGE IN THE DATA REQUIREMENTS HAS ADDRESSED CONCERNS BY THE BALANCING AUTHORITIES SO THE REMAINING OPPOSITION CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO ARGUMENTS FIRST THERE'S AN ARGUMENT OF WHETHER THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE ADDRESS. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS OF POWER PLANTS CONTRARY TO WHAT THE OPPOSITION STATES WANT POWER PLANTS EMISSION CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT LOCAL AIR QUALITY. ANY SUGGESTION THAT MINIMIZING POWER PLANT EMISSIONS SHOULD NOT BE PRIORITIZE IGNORES THE AIR IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES ALREADY BREATHING UNHEALTHY YEAR. THE THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S ANALYSIS OF POWER PLANTS SHOWS THAT EMISSIONS FROM ONE FACILITY CAN NEARLY DOUBLE THE CONCENTRATION OF OF POLLUTANTS AND CONTRIBUTED AREAS EXCEEDING PROTECTIVE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THE ANALYSIS AND THE DATA TO BETTER ASCERTAIN THE IMPACTS THAT INCREASED CYCLING -- HAS ON THESE IMPACTED CAN I MEAN IS AN ARGUMENT FROM A KEPCO AT THAT SECTION D. IS SOMEHOW REDUNDANT OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DISTRICTS ARE REDOING -- WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT THIS ANALYSIS WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT ANALYSIS OF THIS SUIT IT THIS ISSUE DONE IN ANY CONSISTENT WAY ACROSS HERE DISTRICTS THIS LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT A MINIMUM. AT A MINIMUM THE AIR DISTRICTS START TO ANALYZE THESE IMPACTS SO. WE CAN HAVE THE INFORMATION TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION AND DECIDE WHAT STEPS TO TAKE NEXT. WHEN I'M TAKEN THE STEPS WHICH GETTING THE INFORMATION AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN IVA? IN WITH ME ARSON EXPERTS. BUT GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS SEAN ALLOWS ZERO THEM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE A CO SPONSOR OF S. B.. SIXTY FOUR AND SAID HI AS SOME OF YOU KNOW HAS A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING ON ENERGY AND AIR QUALITY ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. S. B. SIXTYFORCE PROTECTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE WHOLE STATE AND ESPECIALLY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE BREATHING SOME OF THE MOST UNHEALTHY THE DIRTIEST AIR IN THE NATION. BUT TWENTY EIGHTEEN AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION REPORT FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA CITIES HAVE. THE WORST AIR POLLUTION IN THE COUNTRY. THIS IMPACTS COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA CITIES INCLUDE EIGHT OF THE TOP TEN WORST CITIES FOR OZONE TAP SEVEN OF THE TOP TEN WERE CITIES FOR YEAR ROUND PARTICULATE POLLUTION AND SEVEN OF THE TOP TEN WERE CITIES FOR SHORT TERM PARTICLE POLLUTION. NO OTHER STATE HAS AS MANY POLLUTED CITIES RIGHT HERE. AS WERE BRIEFING TODAY. THE SACRAMENTO AREA RANKS FIFTH WORST IN THE NATION FOR OZONE. AND ONE POWER PLANTS EMISSIONS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. I'M I HAVE AN EXAMPLE FOR YOU THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES UNFORTUNATELY THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PINOCHET ENERGY CENTER WHICH IS LOCATED IN FRESNO COUNTY. IT'S AN IN NON ATTAINMENT AREA WITH SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE STATE AND IN THE COUNTRY. I'M THE AIR DISTRICTS MODELING OF PANACHE FOUND THAT IT'S NORMAL OPERATING IMPACTS WOULD CAUSE LOCAL EMISSIONS. TO VIOLATE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PARTICULATE MATTER STANDARDS BY OVER A 100% AND ANNUAL STANDARDS BY NEARLY 70%. THE AIR MODELING ANALYSIS DID NOT EVEN CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF START UPS SHUTDOWNS AND PARTIAL OPERATION. AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THE FRESNO MADERA AREA IS THE THIRD WORST IN THE NATION FOR SHORT TERM PARTICLE POLLUTION. SO INTO THIS AREA AT THE AIR DISTRICT WAS PERMITTING AT POWER PLANT AND IT DID NOT MODEL START UPS OR SHUT DOWNS. BUT PINOCHET IS NOW UP AND RUNNING AND IT'S STARTING AND STOPPING NEARLY EVERYDAY AND THIS IS NO EXAGGERATION. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EACH OF ITS UNITS STARTED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TIMES. THE START UP EMISSIONS FROM ANY GAS FIRED POWER PLANT CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN STEADY STATE EMISSIONS. I'M ONE OF THE PILLOW SHE UNITS HAD AND IT MAKES US OXIDE OR KNOCKS RATE OF A HUNDRED AND ELEVEN POUNDS PER AND THE TO YOU WHEN IT STARTED. AND A RATE OF EIGHT POUNDS PER AND BTU DURING STEADY STATE OPERATION THIS MEANS THE PLAN ACTUAL EMISSIONS ARE OVER TEN TIMES MORE THAN THE STEADY STATE EMISSIONS. AND THAT'S WHAT THE AIR DISTRICT WITH MODELING. OTHER PLANTS EMIT EVEN MORE DURING START UP. FOR EXAMPLE THE COLUSA GENERATING STATION IS PERMITTED TO EMIT AS MUCH KNOCKS IN ONE START. AS IT DOES IN THIRTY EIGHT HOURS OF STEADY STATE OPERATION. AS CALIFORNIA INTEGRATES MORE RENEWABLES PLANTS LIKE PANACHE WILL BE CYCLED MORE OFTEN. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE A MECHANISM A UNIFORM MECHANISM FOR AIR DISTRICTS TO CONSIDER THESE CHANGES. THE DISTRICTS CURRENTLY HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE THAT A PERMIT DOES NOT PREVENT OR INTERFERE WITH THE ATTAINMENT OR MAINTENANCE OF ANY APPLICABLE AIR QUALITY STANDARD. I'M AN AIR DISTRICTS CAN'T ISSUE A PERMIT AND LAST THE PERMIT APPLIES WITH ALL APPLICABLE RULES ORDERS REGULATIONS. I'M BUT THE AIR DISTRICTS SO WHILE THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE LIMITS ON CYCLING IN PERMITS. THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY SEEKING INFORMATION ABOUT HOW PLANNED OPERATION IS CHANGING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GRAD. IN FACT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW POWER PLANTS ARE OPERATING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. IS NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE DISTRICTS OR TO THE PUBLIC. YOU HAVE ABOUT THIRTY SEC THANK YOU. PERMITTING REQUIREMENT OF SECTION DE OF SB SIXTY FOUR IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT REDUNDANT TO WHAT THE AIR DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY DOING OTHER SOME DISTRICTS ARE LOOKING AT IMPACTS FROM CYCLING THIS IS NOT TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD THE PINOCHET FACILITY IS A PAINFUL EXAMPLE. I AM BY CONTRAST THE SOUTH COAST IN ITS PERMITTING PROCESS FOR THE VALLEY FACILITY DID MODEL DIFFERENT TYPES OF STARTS AND STOPS AND LOOKED AT THEIR IMPACTS. IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME AIR DISTRICTS MODELING IMPACT AND OTHERS NEGLECTING TO DO THAT MODELING ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE THAT ANALYSIS AND SECTION DE IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE CONSISTENCY AND ENSURE THE ANNOUNCES HAPPENS. WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU NECKS WERE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON LOWER WITH LYNN WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS GOING TO KEEP THIS REALLY SHORT BECAUSE I THINK THAT SENATOR WIECKOWSKI IN CHINA JUST HAD A GREAT JOB INTRODUCING THE BELL. ALL TO SAY THAT YOU ALL KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY COMMITTED TO A TRANSITION AWAY FROM NATURAL GAS TO MEET OUR ELECTRICITY NEEDS ARE STRONG CLIMATE POLICIES ARE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD ARE INEVITABLY. TAKING US DOWN THE ROAD OF REDUCING OUR RELIANCE ON GAS TO THE GREAT BENEFIT OF OUR ECONOMY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER NATURAL GAS CURRENTLY SUPPLIES ABOUT 40% OF OUR ELECTRICITY NEEDS AND WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE GREAT FOR SOMETIME AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO UNDERSCORE. THAT THE PURPOSE OF SB SIXTY FOUR IS NOT TO ENDED INDISCRIMINATELY SHUT DOWN GAS RATHER THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF AN ISSUE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE HAVE HAPPEN. AND EXPECT TO GET MORE ACUTE AND THAT IS THE MORNING THE MORE FREQUENT INCREASE IN THE CYCLING OF NATURAL GAS UNITS AND THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT THIS CAN HAVE ON LOCAL AIR QUALITY. SO AS WE HEARD BEFORE THE PROBLEM IS THAT MANY OF THE STATE'S PLANTS WERE BUILT TO PROVIDE BASELOAD STEADY STATE POWER NOT EXPECTED TO BE TURNED ON AND OFF A LOT AS A RESULT. THIS MORE FREQUENT CYCLING WAS NOT ANTICIPATED AND MANY OF THE ORIGINAL AIR QUALITY PERMITS S. B. SIX BEFORE WE DO THREE THINGS IT WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE DATA MADE AVAILABLE. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING TO THE OPERATION OF THE FLEET AND HOW THAT'S CHANGING OVER TIME. WITH THE AMENDMENTS AGREED TO IN THIS COMMITTEE THE AIR DISTRICTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SIMPLY TAKE THIS INFORMATION INTO ACCOUNT DURING THEIR PERMIT REVIEWS. AND FINALLY THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE EASY TO CONDUCT A STUDY TO MAP OUT WHAT THE INEVITABLE TRANSITION AWAY FROM NATURAL GAS LOOKS LIKE. TO MAKE SURE THAT SUCH A TRANSACTION I TRANSITION HAPPENS IN A WAY THAT PRIORITIZES REDUCTIONS ON GENERATION IN COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY FOSSIL FUELS. SO CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY STARTING TO FEEL THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE SOME OF THE UNHEALTHY AS AIR IN THE COUNTRY. FOR THIS REASON IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE SHIFT TO CLEANER NON FOSSIL RESOURCES. BUT THE STATE ALSO NEEDS BETTER TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE CHANGING OPERATION OF THE GAS FLEET MAY IMPACT AIR QUALITY. AN EXPLICIT MECHANISM TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE IF WE DECIDE THAT IS A PROBLEM. S. B. SIXTY FOUR WOULD ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S RAMP UP AND CLEAN GENERATION DOES NOT LEAD TO THE INTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF FREQUENTLY CYCLING GAS PLANTS IN A WAY THAT INCREASES AIR POLLUTION THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. I LOOK AT IT. POPULOUS IN THE MID UPPER IN SHAW WITH A PEN WORLD ONLY A COSPONSORED BILL -- AND I JUST URGE DRIVE VOTE LIKE CAUSE ACCEPT EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID. FOR AS CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN WHITE WITH THE CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL [inaudible] THANK. THEN OF ASK IS WAY WITH ON THE CALIFORNIA ROOM JUST SCIENCE BUT I LIKE TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR A COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT ALSO FOR LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY THANK YOU AND SUPPORT. HELLO THIS IS DOCTOR JEAN NELSON WITH CALIFORNIANS FOR GREEN NUCLEAR POWER AND I WANTED TO SIMPLY. THIS BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT I AND I WANT TO JUST A HIGHLIGHT ONE DAY'S DATA JUNE FOURTEENTH THE RAMP RIGHT WAS REQUIRED ALMOST SEE. TEAM GIGAWATTS OVER EIGHT HOURS I MEAN THAT IS JUST AN INCREDIBLE INCREASE IN POLLUTION AND THE COURTS TO BEND TECH STUDY PREDICTED THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THANK YOU. A MORENO ON THE HAVE A SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SAYS LINE OF OUR WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU ARE CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. THAT'S WHERE A BUDGET WITH A WHITE MAN GROUP UNHAPPY SPAY COMMUNITY ENERGY IN SUPPORT. GEN A PRICE WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS. OKAY WILL NOW ENTERTAIN -- WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE TO TALK TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. DON'T GO FAR [inaudible] YES. TAKE PITCHED CLARIFIED DID NOT ARE THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE REQUESTED A THEY REFLECTED IN THE VERSION THAT'S ON OUR TABLET OR NOT. I JUST AYE WHAT I WASN'T THE MAYOR INTO THEIR HOUSES YEAH THE THE MINUTES ARE REFLECTED IN THE MAIN ANALYSIS NO BUT IN TERMS OF THE BILL TECH [inaudible] NO. OKAY PLUS CHRIS SO THEN BABY AFTER THE TEST I COULD YOU JUST TELL US WHAT AT LEAST WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND HE DELETED WE WE WERE HERE WE TOOK. NOT JUST A BIT BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW. YEAH I I JUST CAN'T TELL OF I HONESTLY FOR BEGIN THE BILL TAX EXCUSE ME HER HER ENOUGH. I WENT AFTER WE TAKE THE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION THEN WILL. TURN BACK TO YOU AND THEN YOU CAN CLARIFY. THE AMENDMENTS IN THE THANK YOU MISTER PLEASE PROCEED OKAY TECHNICAL MONEY PYTHON NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT -- MIND CHANCE BUT HE JONES FOR THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS -- AND WE ARE -- OPPOSED TO THIS BILL WE ARE POSTED WITHOUT PRIOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT'S BEEN AMENDED BUT WE STILL DON'T LIKE THE BILL WHICH UP PERHAPS WON'T COME AS A SURPRISE. WE BELIEVE THAT SB SIXTY FOUR ON A IN NECESSARILY CREATES A TENSION BETWEEN A NEW ERA THE THE RELIABLE OPERATION THE GRID AS IT EXISTS TODAY -- YOU KNOW POST ENERGY CRISIS YEAH LEGISLATURE PASSED AB FIFTY SEVEN OF WHICH RESULTED IN -- OVER THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS OR SO ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW NATURAL GAS FACILITIES THAT -- REPLACE OLDER LESS EFFICIENT -- UNITS ARE IN SOME OF THOSE OLDER UNITS THAT WERE REPLACED BY THE WAY WE'RE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE HUNTERS POINT PATROL HILL CHULA VISTA WHICH SEEMS TO GO UNNOTICED BY -- THE PROPONENTS -- THE FACT A MATTER IS GAS PRODUCES ABOUT 40% OF THE ENERGY WE NEED FOR RAMPING WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT -- IN YOU AND AND OBVIOUSLY -- OPERATES AT NIGHT AND PRODUCES POWER WHEN THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE FIRES AND ACCORDING TO THE S. B. THREE FIFTY STUDY -- CONSTITUTES ABOUT 1% TERRY POLLUTANTS IN THE IN THE IN THE STATE SO LET'S. KIND OF GO THROUGH THIS VERY QUICKLY -- DE DATUL GAS INDUSTRY AVERAGE REPRESENT MOST OF THE INDEPENDENTLY OWNED -- BASICALLY ARE HEAVILY REGULATED ALREADY BY THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS -- IT TO MEET LOCALIZED -- STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULD WITH THE GAY ISSUE OF KNOCKS THAT IS A LOCAL ISSUE THAT IS NOT LIMITED TO A CENSUS TRACK -- THAT IDENTIFIES THE DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY -- A BIT IS IT IT IT'S A BROADER REGIONAL PUT OUT SORT OF ISSUE AND IS ALREADY REGULATED THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MEET EMISSIONS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND PARTICIPATING CAP AND TRADE -- THE FACT THAT THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO BILL UNLESS ADMITTED SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT THE REGULATORS AND THOSE THAT ARE BEING REGULATED SORT OF AGREE ON AN ISSUE -- SO WE WE REALLY HAVE A WE ARE VERY TROUBLED BY THAT -- BASICALLY I THINK IT SECTION BE AS WAS INDICATED EARLIER IS DECIDE TO GIVE INFORMATION IT SEEMS THAT THE REST OF THE IT IT SEEMS THAT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA. BUT THEN WE WANT TO REGULATE. WE WENT AT THESE OTHER TYPES OF REGULATIONS BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE WANT TO APPLY SOME DATA TO IT SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT -- PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE ON THAT -- DNF SECTIONS ARE STILL THERE NEAR TROUBLING A AND AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CREATES YET A NEW AIR QUALITY STANDARD THAT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON HOW PLANTS GET DISPATCHED. OKAY IT'S BETTER THAN IT WAS BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH BODY IAN HAVE SECTIONS NEED TO COME OUT COMPLETELY -- AND THEN FINALLY SECTION -- TO IS IS -- AYE I THINK TOTALLY IN A THE COMMISSION TRYING TO DETERMINE -- YOU KNOW HOW PRIVATE BRA PROBABLY ALL POWER PLANTS ARE GOING TO BE RETIRED -- AS ANALYSIS INDICATES A DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ISSUES LIKE COST RELIABILITY IN THOSE OTHER ISSUES SO OTHER THAN THAT IT'S FINE BUT WHERE TO PUT OPPOSED A. B. ESPY'S AT SIXTY FOUR ANALYTIC URGENT ABOUT. RIGHT AND I AM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AMENDMENTS WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SUGGEST. YES RIGHT AND WELL YES PRODUCT THE COVER I DON'T THINK IT PAY TO THE AMENDMENTS. OUT WILL COST THE ENTHUSIASM OF MISTER SCOTT NAY JONES. YES OPPOSITION WE DO AGREE ON THAT WILL NOT A CLOSE LOOK ON YET ANOTHER WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION WHETHER. WE GET IT THERE. RIGHT RIGHT DATES. ABOUT ONE'S ATTENTION TO AND THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS -- WHERE WE REFERRED? TO A STRIKE IN THE REPORTING OF DATA BY THE DALLAS IN AUTHORITY -- WHICH IS PAGE THREE LINES TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY SEVEN AND INSTEAD REQUIRE THE GAS PLANTS REPORT THAT DATA TOOK PART. CORRECT AND THEN ON PAGE SEVEN OTHER COMMITTEE -- MINUTES SHOW THAT -- STRIKING SUBDIVISIONS E. AND F.. PAGE. FOUR LINES TWENTY THREE THROUGH. TWENTY NINE PAGE FIVE LINES ONE THROUGH [inaudible] THIRTY SEVEN YES YES. SO THAT MEANS SECTIONS DNF WOULD BE DELETED YES CURRENT THAT'S CORRECT [inaudible] IT'S GREAT. WE THINK WE GOT MOST OF THEM BUT NOT ALL OF THEM. TRIP. HAD BEEN JUST SO MISTY BUT WE GOT THE N. F. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL A COMPROMISE. I JUST IT WOULD EVER BE WORK CLEAR -- YES I AM TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS CLOSER AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS BURGER [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS AFTER YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALAN HAVE SOME OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION I REPRESENT THE F. THIRTY FIVE AIR POLLUTION. CONTROL OFFICERS. IN CALIFORNIA -- WE VOTE WE'VE SUBMIT AMENDED -- AND PROVIDED AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR -- WERE WERE OUT WE'RE HAPPY SEE THAT MOST OF THOSE AMENDMENTS HAVE HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED -- REGRETTABLY -- I THINK WE STILL HAVE A ISSUE WITH THE WITH THE SECTION DE WHICH IS STILL BEEN LEFT IN -- OVERALL A CAT CHO BELIEVES THERE'S A VALUE IN THE STUDY APPROACH OUR OUR AMENDMENTS A PROPOSED A WAY TO OF GET AIR DISTRICTS INVOLVED WITH THAT STUDY APPROACH TO PROVIDE THE DATA NECESSARY TO THE BALANCING AUTHORITY TO THE C. E. SEAT ISSUE PIECE. SEE TO OUR TO MAKE IT AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT THE ROLE OF CYCLING POWER PLANTS ARE IN THE FUTURE. AND IT BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT SECTION D. -- DESPITE -- THE SENATOR'S STATEMENTS WE BELIEVE IT IS DUPLICATIVE OF WHAT THEY'RE DISTRICTS CURRENTLY DO IT'S ACTUALLY -- RECORD IT REQUIRES A MORE THAN WHAT AIR DISTRICTS CURRENTLY DO BECAUSE IT IT REOPENS A PERMIT AND AND THEN -- HAS THEIR DISTRICTS MAKE A THAT DETERMINATION ABOUT THE ROLE OF DISPATCH FOR EVEN MINOR AMENDMENTS SUCH IS A CHANGING OF MAILING ADDRESS CHANGING THE FIRE PUMP SOMETHING OUT SOMETHING REALLY MINOR LIKE THAT TO AND IF A IF THE COMMITTEE -- CO FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN AIR DISTRICT HERE TO TALK ABOUT OF PERMITTING AND US SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE OTHER FACILITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN. A GREAT WAVE WE HAVE HAD TO A WITNESSES WHICH I THINK IS APPROPRIATE WILL TAKE. WHAT WE DO THIS IF THEY'RE QUESTIONS AMONGST THE OF THE COMMITTEE? CERTAIN TAKE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AS WE OR WOULD IT BE YOUR COMMENT MISTER SHARON PATRICK RAFTER THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES SITUATION BY CAN JUST ADD. A COUPLE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITE YOURS BUT I WANTED TO DO THOUGH I WANT TO TAKE. THE TWO WITNESSES IF IT'S VERY QUICK NO PROBLEM. BUT WHY DO WE HOLD IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL IT'S IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE PERTINENT. TO YOU'RE BEING ABLE -- TO ADD TO THAT THE COMMENTARY SO WHY DON'T WE TAKE OTHERS FROM THE AUDIENCE WHO WERE HERE. JUST NAME. AFFILIATION SOURCE SENATOR OUTTA NOW I THINK THERE'S OTHERS WHO OPPOSE THE BILL. THEIR IT [inaudible] NOBODY. PATTY DUNLAP ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S AMENDMENTS BUT WE'RE WE REMAIN OPPOSED. GOOD AFTERNOON MARKER TO SOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE REMAIN OPPOSED AS WELL THANK YOU. DO ANY HUNTER FOR* OPPOSE. MICHAEL SHOT CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURED TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POSED. ANTHONY SAMPSON HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POWER AUTHORITY IN OPPOSITION. CASSANDRA OFF WITH CALPINE STILL IN OPPOSITION EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. P. MONTGOMERY FOR ENERGY ENERGY IN OPPOSITION. MARGOT PARKS IN THE HAVE THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION UP IN OPPOSITION SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED ABOUT A IMPACTS ON COGENERATION UNITS THINKING. REX W. HAMA BE HAVE CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION ALSO POST. ISRAEL SALAS WITH SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC ALSO POST. SARAH TARRY WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY IN OPPOSITION. TOM EDISON OF THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AYE HERE IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUE WE THINK THAT SECTION D. IN FACT. MAKES OUR AIR POLLUTION PROBLEMS WORSE IT CREATES BARRIERS IT DOES NOT HELP US REDUCE EMISSIONS IT CREATES A WORSE AN IMPROV SET OF PROBLEMS. WE TOOK. HER WAIT DID YOU MEAN EAR DE. DE IS OUT D. LIKE DOG OKAY THANK YOU. I GAVE ONE WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT THAT MEDIA POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICER. AND AT THE TEARS PLEASURE I AM ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PERMITTING PROCESSES. BOMB WERE ALSO IN A OPPOSITION -- CONVOCATIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. OF FOR THE RECORD SENATOR I WOULD HAVE SAID DO YOU LIKE DELIGHTFUL. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I WILL -- WILL TURN TO THE IT'S MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN. FIRST OF ALL SAY THANK YOU SENATOR FOR A BUT ADDRESSING LISTEN VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WHY I SUPPORTED DEATH. YOUR BILL OUT OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE OH HOWEVER I TO HAVE -- CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY THE CAPITAL OF REPRESENTATIVES -- SPECIFICALLY AS TO SUBDIVISION DE -- AS MUST MONEY JONES INDICATED AYE I AM CONCERNED WHEN THE AIR QUALITY REGULATORS ARE SAYING THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE AIR QUALITY WORSE -- AND IT WAS ALSO IN ARGUMENT WAS ALSO MADE TO ME THAT -- AS INDICATING THE CAP BECAUSE LETTER OF JUNE TWENTY FIFTH -- THAT -- THEY ARE. ASSERTING THAT. SUBDIVISION DE IS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT -- AND SO IT COULD YOU ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS [inaudible] AT IF THROUGH THE THROUGH THE AYE CHAIR HAD. FOR MY SPONSORS. GET RIGHT BECAUSE AYE WE'VE HAD MANY CHANGES AND BACK AND FORTH I WANTED GIVE THAT COMMITTEE EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. BY ALL MEANS AM THANK YOU SO I'M SORRY WITH THE QUESTION WHETHER SUBDIVISION DE THE OF THEM WITHIN VIOLATE ON OF THE HIGH FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. AND THIS IS AN ALLEGATION THAT'S BEEN RAISED BY -- BY THE V. SO POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS TO SO I HAVE SEEN THE THE OPPOSE UNLESS AMEND. LETTER FROM CAPT HOA ALLEGING THAT SUBDIVISIONS IAN ATTHE. WERE IN VIOLATION OF SECTION I'M ONE OF THAT CLEAN AIR ACT THERE IS. NO SUPPORT IN FEDERAL LAW OR IN STATE LAW FOR THAT POSITION WE'VE DONE AT LEGAL ANALYSIS AND THE THE CLEAN AIR ACT PLAIN LANGUAGE DOES NOT SUPPORT IT IN FACT THE CLEAN AIR ACT IS STRUCTURED. SO THAT EACH STATE. IS ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE PROTECTIVE [inaudible] I'M. REGULATION THAT VAN THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE NEVER INTERPRETED THE CLEAN AIR ACT FOR THAT INTERPRETATION. AND WE'VE REMOVED SUBDIVISIONS I'M AYE IT YOU HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BAY AREA AND KEPT COHERER. WHO COULD IF THEY FELT THAT SECTION? D. WERE IN ANY WAY IN VIOLATION. GOT WITH PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR. YEAH HAPPY TO TRADING ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THERE IS ONE THING THAT WE AGREE WITH THE SPONSORS ON IT FACT SEVERAL ONE POWER PLANTS ARE DIRTY NEED THEIR THEIR MISSIONS NEED TO COME DOWN. TO THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT PROBLEM WITH SECTION ONE TWENTY THREE IS PROTECTIONS THE ENOUGH THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE BILL WHAT WE DISAGREE ON INDISCREET QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY. IS THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF AN THE WHICH IS BEING LEFT IN THIS BILL ON AIR QUALITY THAT'S WHERE THE DISAGREEMENT AIRS. BUT WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT SECTIONS <u>&lt;c.green&gt; ENOUGH CAME OUT&lt;/c&gt;</u> BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED FROM OUR OUR STRONG LEGAL PERSPECTIVE. A FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT PROBLEM THAT'S NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THANKS TO THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THAT AMENDMENT [inaudible] SO MISTER CHAIR I BELIEVE THE FEDERAL CONCERNS WITH REGARD TO THE MISTER OUR SUMMERS MARRIAGE YOU MURATSUCHI IS QUESTION HAPPEN TAKE CARE CAN. HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OKAY SO WE'RE JUST DEALING WITH THE LOCAL CONCERN IN MY ENTHUSIASM TO HAVE. UPDATE REPORTING AND YOU KNOW ASSISTING THE LOCAL THAT. BOTH THE STATE AND ASSISTING US IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT HOW THE AIR QUALITY CHANGES IN IN THERE AND THAT PERMITTING THAT WE'RE DOING ON THESE. PLANTS THAT WERE PERMITTED AS CONTINUOUS CYCLE. ARE CONTINUOUS USE AND OUR CYCLING UPCYCLING DOWN AND WHAT IT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN NHL. TO FIND POSTS ABOUT IT IF I MAY UP THE FOLLOW UP THAT I I WOULD LIKE FURTHER CLARIFICATION AS TO WHAT EXACTLY YOUR CONCERNS ARE WITH. SUBDIVISION DE IT ABSOLUTELY AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ARTICULATE OUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH SUB THAT SUB IT WITH PARAGRAPH DE. AYE TO THE COMMITTEE. THERE MULTIPLE FIRST OF ALL -- WE HAVE BEEN LAW TODAY A WIDE VARIETY OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ON HOW WE PERMIT POWER PLANTS FOR EXAMPLE I WE'RE REQUIRED -- TO AS WE ARE FOR ALL PERMITS TO DO WELL A WATERS ACT ANALYSIS SAID I HEAR TOXIC HOTSPOTS ANALYSIS TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF THOSE FACILITIES ON ADJACENT COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING A MS WATERS WHEN SHE WAS IN THIS BUILDING AUTHORED A WONDERFUL LAWYER TOXIC HOTSPOTS PROGRAM THE PROBLEM WITH. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE IS THAT IN DE R. PARAGRAPH. I SEE WHERE REQUIRED NOW DO SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT AND IN FACT A AND B. AND C. ARE ALL SIMILAR IN THAT RESPECT IN THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE A NEW REQUIREMENT THAT'S VERY SIMILAR. SEE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO UNDER THE WATERS ACT BUT IT'S DIFFERENT AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S WEAKER. AND SO THE PROBLEM THAT WE SEE IT'S COMPLETELY AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THAT BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT. WE'VE GOT OUR EXISTING WATERS ACT PROCESS TO LOOK AT SPECIFIC WE THIS ISSUE NOW WE'VE GOT A NEW REQUIREMENT. SO NOW LET'S SAY THAT A POWER PLANT COMES THEN WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO. SUES ME. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET TOO FAR THAT I MEAN I THINK ONCE YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT AND I THINK. WE ALL GET YOUR POINT -- I THINK THIS IS A A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION ON THIS SECTION SO. YOU HAVE YOUR POSITION ON IT MISTER -- TING. I'M SORRY DOCTOR EGGMAN. I THINK YOU CAN THANK YOUR SARKOZY SECULAR SCENE THE SPELLING THANK YOU I THINK. I THINK WE'RE MOVING IN OUR DIRECTION -- I GUESS MY QUESTION HAS TO DO ALSO WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT. A SECTION D. AS IN DELTA BOTTOM. A MILITARY VETERAN -- SO. AND AND I SAID THIS IN THE LAST COMMITTEE SO WE I MEAN. WE INVESTED IN A LOT OF THESE PLANTS AND THERE ARE ALL AND A LOT OF I HAVE TO IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW -- AND WHILE DIDN'T KNOW BUT NOBODY LIKES DIRTY AIR WE ALSO KNOW THAT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE GONE INTO THAT AND AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RIPLE EFFECTS OF THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE THIS CHAIR IS MOVING TOWARDS IS LOOKING AT WHEN WE TAKE OUT A PLANT WATER. THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF THAT WE'RE MEASURING THESE THINGS AND WOULD YOU ALSO BE OPEN TO LOOK AT WHERE THE RIPPLE EFFECTS LIKE ON COMMUNITIES OF CLOSING THESE DOWN ALSO AS OPPOSED. TO A GREATER -- THAT THE JOB FACTORS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT AND INVESTMENT THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AND PERHAPS NOT REALIZED. THAT INVESTMENT YET WAS WHEN MY QUESTIONS AND THEM [inaudible] DE. IF WE ARE NOW JUST EVALUATING HOW WILL THAT BE USED IN WILL THAT BE USED IN THE IN THE CONSIDERATION OF OF A PERMIT RENEWALS. IT'S JUST IT'S NOT FOR A VALUE. RIGHT IT'S NOT DIG IT IT DOESN'T TAKE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION JUST SAYS YOU CAN EVALUATE IT. I MEAN I THINK HOPEFULLY AT THE AT ONE LEVEL IT'S GIVEN TO US TO DECISION MAKERS YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO GET WE'RE GONNA GET INFORMATION ON A YEARLY BASIS ON EMISSIONS AND THERE. AB SIX SEVENTEEN RIGHTS WE'RE GONNA GET THE YEARLY NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS MORE PRECISE AYE. INFORMATION ON POLLUTION BASED ON THE THAT THE OPERATION OF THE GREAT AND THIS CYCLING AND INFORMATION WHAT WE CHOOSE TO DO WITH THAT. IS FOR ANOTHER DAY I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT. MAYBE I HAVE FIVE SPEAK OUT. I THINK THAT YOU GET YOUR PERMIT YOU'RE RUNNING YOUR YOUR REP OPERATING AS A PARENT WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE AT WHAT THIS WHAT THIS THAT IS WE NEVER THOUGHT THAT. WE THOUGHT THAT IF YOU'RE RUNNING IT ALL THE TIME IT WOULD BE AT THIS LEVEL POLLUTION THAT WERE SAYING THE WAY IT'S BEING OPERATED IT'S AT THAT LEVEL OF POLLUTION IT'S UP TO US I'M FIX YOUR CALL THE BOARD THE GOOD REPORTED. BUT IT'S UP TO US TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD BE. THOUGH I LET ME JUST DIDN'T SAY THAT I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND AND SECTION DE WE BELIEVE IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT. IT MAKE SURE THAT THIS NEW ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE CREATING [inaudible] IS. EVALUATED IT DOESN'T JUST SIT THERE IT'S PART OF THE PROCESS THAT THE AIR DISTRICTS. IT'S PART OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE AIR DISTRICTS TAKEN WHEN THEY EVALUATE. THE PLANT IN A PERMITTING PROCESS THE BILL EXPLICITLY DOES NOT SPECIFY WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION OR WHETHER TO DO ANYTHING WITH THAT INFORMATION. IT JUST REQUIRES THAT THAT INFORMATION BE PART OF THE EVALUATION PROCESS. I DON'T THINK YOU SO I GUESS MY PART PARTLY MY CONFUSION IS GENERALLY. ON MR ALLISON'S VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT SPONSORS OF THE GROUP THE SPECIAL AIR QUALITY ISSUES SO. WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDS HOW COME? HOW COME THERE'S MISALIGNMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOALS OF MISTER HARRIS'S AGENCIES ARE EXACTLY THE GOALS AS ESPOUSED IN THE BILL? I IS IT REALLY AN IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE IS HERE. ON NO IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING REGARDING. THE MANAGEMENT OF THE STATE AND THEN JUST TRY TO GET OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THERE IS THIS -- DISCONNECT WHEN THERE SEEMS TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE OVERALL GOALS OF THIS ISSUE. MATTHEW MISTER ALLISON BUT THAT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIR. AND THEN THE SPONSORS TO OF THEIR WORK AND THAT'S FINE. WAS REYES WHO WANTED TO REPLY AND THEN THE SITE IF YOU. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION WE VERY MUCH DO WHAT TO CUT EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS. AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT AS WE GET MORE RENEWABLES THE EFFECTIVE CYCLING. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE NO PROBLEM THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE. OF BE AND SEE THE PARTS THAT. ARE AS WELL AS SECTION WHO THE PARTS THAT YOU GET AT THAT ISSUE. THE REASON THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE D. IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT DATA IS GOING TO HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO DO THE REGULATORY PERMITTING WORK ON THESE FACILITIES. THAT WE NEED TOO TILL IT SETS UP UP PARALLEL BUT DIFFERENT PROCESS. FOR MORE THE POLL. THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY REQUIRED FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- THERE ARE A VARIETY IS. OF ISSUES WITH SOME FOR EXAMPLE. WE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE WERE GIVEN AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK IN A THE JUDGE THE EFFECTIVE DISPATCH. ON THE STATE'S GOAL. TO MINIMIZE THE MISSING FROM THESE FACILITIES WHICH IS NEVER DEFINED HER SAID ANYWHERE. IN LAW CURRENTLY ARE IN THIS BILL. SO IT SETTING US UP TO FAIL AND IT'S SETTING UP TO POWER LOW PROPHECIES. FOUR THINGS THAT ALREADY EXIST WHICH CORPORATE IF THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT. YES AND THANK YOU FOR I MIGHT THIS IS A MISTER TING AN EXCELLENT. QUESTION WHY A WE ARE NOT IN ON EXACTLY THE SAME PAGE AND SO THE AYE AIR TOXICS. RULE WHICH ON COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT WAS EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF ADDRESSES DIFFERENT [inaudible] POLLUTANTS THEN THE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS THAT WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT FROM GAS FIRED POWER PLANTS. AND AND SO IT MAY BE SOMEWHAT IN PARALLEL BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING AND WE ARE NOT SEEING THESE. OBJECTIVES BEING ACCOMPLISHED STATEWIDE AS I SAID IN MY OPENING REMARKS SOME AIR DISTRICTS ARE IN FACT LOOKING AT CYCLING IMPACTS SOME ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT. AND SO -- YOU KNOW TO PURSUE YOU YOU KNOW THE GOAL OF BREATHABLE AIR FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES IS WHAT SB SIXTY FOUR BRINGS US. AND THE NOT NO EXISTING -- LAWS OR RULES SEEM TO BE DOING THAT AT THE MOMENT [inaudible] TIA FOLLOW. YEAH SO I I GUESS I'M I'M STILL -- HAS ALSO MATHIS QUESTIONS OF A DIFFERENT -- I MEAN GENERALLY MY AIR QUALITY DISTRICT WHICH IS BESET MISTRUST REPRESENTS WERE SEEN AS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE. THE MOST PROGRESSIVE PALM USUALLY WERE NOT SEEN AS THE ONES WHO NEED TO BE DRAGGED ALONG USUALLY WERE KIND OF LEADING THE PACK. SO HELP ME UNDER IS IS IT. GEE IS IT YOUR FEELING THAT. ARE YOU WANT TO MOVE IN THIS AREA AND THE AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS IN GENERAL OR EVEN SPECIFICALLY THE BAY AREA ONCE. ARE NOT INTERESTED IN MOVING THIS DIRECTION WAS THERE SORT OF BUREAUCRATIC RESISTANCE I'M JUST. WE'LL TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION JUST WERE CLEAR THE SOUTH COAST IS OKAY WITH THIS LANGUAGE THERE THE LONGEST AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THE INFORMATION THAT I'VE GOT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. AN OBJECTION TO THIS SO WITHIN THE YEAR THE REGIONAL DISTRICTS. YOU KNOW I I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL THIRTY EIGHT OF THEM I'VE GOT. TWO OF THEM THEY'RE HERE. BUT BILL FISCAL SENATOR WHAT WHY IS OUR AIR QUALITY. DISTRICT OPPOSED TO YOUR BILL. USUALLY I GUESS THEIR THEIR JOY SEEN AS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE. ON GOING AFTER POLLUTANTS. NOW IF AT MEAN. IT'S A CONCERN TO ME TOO BUT I YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO CREATE AND TRYING TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE WE GET THE BEST INFORMATION. ON HOW THE CITY'S THESE PLANTS ARE OPERATING IN TODAY'S WORLD BUT RECENT WITH CYCLING AND IF IT [inaudible] CREATES. HEARTBURN BECAUSE WE HAVE NEW CRITERIA THAT WERE ASKING THAT'S MEANINGFUL TO US THAT I WANT TO HAVE. PUT IN THE FORM THAT'S OF AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE CAN USE AND ALSO WE GET A STEADY BEN. I GUESS WE HAVE HARPER AND I'M YOU KNOW. I I KEEP I'VE READ THIS FOURTEEN TIMES I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY IS THE LANGUAGE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THAT. TRIPS EVERYBODY UP -- THAT REALLY IS WHERE YOUR CHOIR SUMMERS. AND MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND IF IT DOES IF IT DOES THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING TO SAY HOW WE OPERATE IN THE NEW WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN THAT WERE. RECYCLING ALL THE TIME WHAT IS THE GOOD AND THEY AND LET THAT LOOK THAT. PLANTS FALL INTO THE BIG CATEGORIES THAT THEY ARE. BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE COMMUNITY IT'S UP TO US TO STE PART TWO COMES LATER WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL THIS THIS DATA AND WE SAY WELL MY GOD WE SHOULD CHANGE THE RULES OR IRREGULAR -- THE REGULATIONS BUT I'M NOT DOING THAT HERE RIGHT BECAUSE I HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS. MISTER TING YOUR YOU GOT YOUR ANSWER IS GOOD AS AN ANSWER TO GET BECAUSE I NEED TO TALK GALLON I I GUESS I'M STILL. CONFUSED AS TO WHAT THE ISSUE IS. GROW ANYWAYS OKAY UP WHEN TO GIVE DOCTOR QUIRK A GOOD CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT I'M CERTAINLY. I'M SURE YOU'VE YOU TELL ME WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT IS. THIS MONTH WITH THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AYE I'VE ENJOYED THE ROBUST CONVERSATION FROM THE BACK OF THE ROOM. AND I WELCOME TO THE FROM THANK YOU SORRY SORRY TO BE LATE TO THE PARTY. I I WANTED -- TO JUST EXPRESSED FIRST OF ALL THE SOUTH COAST -- BOARD IS NOT AUTHORIZED A POSITION ON THE BILL WE ARE WATCHING WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR IN WITH THE SPONSOR -- THAT SAID WITH SUBDIVISION DE WE DO HAVE SOME TECHNICAL CONCERNS AND WE'VE WE'VE LOVE THE CHANCE TO CONTINUE BECAUSE AND THE LANGUAGE CAN BE FIXED WE DON'T HAVE AN IDEOLOGICAL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OR WHAT THE SPONSORS ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE AUTHORS. IS TRYING TO IT'S A PUT THE BELT BUT EVERY TO CONTINUE TALKING WOULD BE GREAT AT THE GROUND AND COME TO SOME AGREEMENT WITH THAT THAT'S HELPFUL -- SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS SIX ARE GOING AROUND THROUGHOUT DE SO LET'S ISN'T DYNAMIC -- BUT ONLY NOT ARE. ALRIGHT THAT WOULD BE THE LAST -- ONE DOCTOR QUIRK SO DOC I THINK FIRST OF ALL IT'S GOTTEN A MAN SO IT HASN'T BEEN OUT VERY LONG AND THEN. USUALLY THESE THINGS CAN BE RESOLVED SO I ASK YOU SENATOR WILL YOU WORK WITH THE AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS.

TO VOTE AGAINST IT ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU. BUT EVEN IF I COULD SAY I JUST EL ARE ALIGNED MY MY COMMENTS AGAIN I THINK WE ALL WE ALL WANT CLEAN AIR WE ALL KNOW I GUESS AT SOME POINT YOU TO GO AWAY BUT WE KNOW. WE DON'T LIKE CREED AND ENERGY CRISIS AS WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND WE'RE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN ISOLATION AND I'VE BEEN ONE WHO KEEP SAYING WE NEED A BIGGER HOLISTIC PLAN TO REALLY SEE. HOW WE'RE GOING FORWARD -- BUT IF THE AIR QUALITY FOLKS ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T DO IT AND I WAS GONNA ASK IF THIS DOESN'T ONTO APPROPRIATION JET BUT WHAT KIND OF PRICE TAG IS GOING TO BE ON THAT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING. THEY HAVE TO START A WHOLE NEW PROGRAM TO ANALYZE. THAT DID IT THE DIFFERENT POLLUTANTS SO AGAIN I ALSO WILL SUPPORT TODAY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AIR QUALITY DISTRICT FORCED TO BE ABLE THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE SAME GOAL. AND AGAIN AS WE TALK ABOUT A MORE HOLISTIC ACTS OF LIMITING PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO USE PLANTS WHEN THEY NEED TO BE USED JUST ON A THE INVESTMENTS AND THE JOBS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE SINKS.

WELL I FEEL AS A GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ENERGY RESOURCE FOR US IN THE FUTURE AND IT'S NOT FROM ANYONE PARTICULAR RESOURCE IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE GREAT IN ITS USEFULNESS TO OUR COMMUNITIES IN THIS IS THE NOTION OF MICRO GRADES WE'VE SEEN -- VENTURA COUNTY AND THROUGH -- THE FIRES OUT THERE IN THE NORTH BAY THE INCREDIBLE IMPACT OF DISASTERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE NEED A MORE RESILIENT GRID -- AND WE THINK MICRO GRADS ARE IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE -- I DID WANT TO START OFF BY ITS APPRECIATING THE COMMITTEE'S WORK -- AND ACCEPTING A THEM AMENDMENTS AS WE DISCUSS MISTER CHAIR AND ON THE POINT OF THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES I I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT AND HERE. I KNOW THERE'S SOME ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL THAT PO USE ARE ALSO PUTTING FORWARD SO I JUST WANT TO FLAG THAT ONE IS AN ISSUE THAT. WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ON BUT YOU KNOW THESE PRINCIPLES AND THE ROAD MAP OUTLINED BY YOUR STAFF -- MAKE MAKES TOTAL SENSE AND SENATOR I AM MY APOLOGIES FOR INTERRUPTING YOUR FLAT BUT JUST SO THAT THE COMMITTEE -- BECAUSE YOU AND I DID HAVE A CONVERSATION YES OF TODAY SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE ALERT -- TO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IN TERMS OF THE TWEAKING OF LANGUAGE ON PAGE SIX IS THE THIRD BULLET POINT DOWN -- WORD STARTS DETERMINE IF SEPARATE UTILITIES AND WE STRUCK AND DETERMINE IF AND HAVE DEVELOPED. AND THEN AS YOU MAKE YOUR AY THROUGH THE SENTENCE -- WHERE WE HAVE TARIFF ARE WE STRIKE ARE AND WOULD HAVE AS SO READ DEVELOP? SEPARATE UTILITY RATES AND TERROR. AS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT MICROGRAPHS YES OKAY. SO THANK YOU FOR ITERATING AND WORKING THROUGH THIS AND YOU KNOW. WE'RE COGNIZANT OF RATE PAYER IMPACT ISSUES -- WERE AWARE OF SOME TO SEE CA -- FACTORS BROUGHT UP IN THE ANNOUNCES BUT WE THINK THAT GETTING THE P. YOU SEE SOME OF AFFIRMATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING IN THIS ROADMAP THEY'RE DEVELOPING MAKE SENSE. AND THAT WE KNOW MICROGRAMS OF IMPORTANT PLACE IN OUR FUTURE -- IT'S CRITICAL FOR THEM TO HEAR FROM US SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE AND BOTH OF A CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DELANEY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF ADVANCED MICRO GRID SOLUTIONS THE CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION. AND THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ON STRUCK SUPPORT. WITH THINK SENATOR STERN FIRST DEDICATION TO THIS ISSUE ITS KEY AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE FUTURE OF THIS GREAT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS ONE ENSURING CUSTOMERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE THEIR ENERGY USAGE IN THEIR OWN HANDS. AND MAKE THAT NEED MORE RESILIENT AS THEY MOVE FORWARD FOR TWO FOR UTILITIES THAT MAY WANT TO DO THE SAME THING. TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES FIGURE OUT LAKE PORTION OF THEIR GRID THAT'S CRITICAL HOSPITAL. FIRE STATION POLICE STATIONS. AND THREE AS AS CITIES AND OR OTHER COMMUNITIES MAY WANT TO WORK WITH UTILITIES TO DO THAT WORK. WE THINK THE DIRECTION OF THE BILL IN SERVE SETTING OUT A FRAMEWORK FOR THE PC TO DO THEIR WORK IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. I'M AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK AS WELL. THAT JUNE MEMBERS MISTER CHAIR LAURA BENNETT WITH TECH NET WE'RE HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY SUPPORT THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE IS BUILDING PURGES THAT OF DEPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA'S MOST INNOVATIVE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES.

THANK YOU -- OTHER OTHERS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF OF THIS BILL. S. B.. THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST ON A PRICE ON THE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA LEAVE CONSERVATION VOTERS WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AS IT IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. IN PRINT THANK YOU. OBVIOUSLY SHAUN BEHALF OF ADVANCED ENERGY ECONOMY IN SUPPORT. JANNA SLANT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY STORAGE ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. I WENT OVER BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AT THE MARIN ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SCOTT WHICH ON THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN WERE -- IN BETWEEN IF I COULD HAVE A SECOND TO ADDRESS WHY -- IT MANNING OF KP ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER -- WE ARE THRILLED TO BE SELECTED AS THE ONLY PEELING HIS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL -- AFTER THE MEMBERS -- WE ARE -- A WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR SEE ANYWAY IT OFFERED AMENDMENTS FOR A PATH. TO WORK WITH THE SPONSOR'S TO INITIATE A PROCESS -- IT'S CRITICAL TO ALL THE PO USE THAT IF THERE IS A PROCESS THAT PROCESS BE LOCALLY DETERMINED -- AND THAT THERE BE A PROCESS THROUGH WHICH OF SOMEONE'S. WHO WON A MICRO GOOD WOULD INITIATE ARM A PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL [inaudible] TO ANALYZE. OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE COST SUCCESSOR AS SUGGESTED BY SOME OF THE CRITERIA IN THE BILL. SO -- WE HOPE TO HAVE -- TIME TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE. NOW THAT WHERE. SINGLED OUT -- THROUGH JULY TO TRY TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE COMFORTABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- WILL NOW RECEIVE -- TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLACE PRECISION. HELLO ARM MY NAME IS TED REGULARLY AND I WORK FOR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC AND THE DIRECTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH OUR MICRO GRAVITY AND ENERGY STORAGE EFFORTS. PRONE WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED. TO THE BILL. BUT WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THAT. COMMITTEE -- AMENDMENTS AND WE GOT THE COMMITTEE FOR THOSE AMENDMENTS. THE WARREN -- IT GETS US ABOUT 90% OF THE WAY THERE THE ONE ARE WHERE WE STILL HAVE ISSUE IS HIS BULLET FOR BULLET. THREE ON PAGE [inaudible] SIX WHICH ADDRESSES [inaudible] TARIFFS -- THE MAIN CONCERN HERE IS AROUND. A WHAT WE CALL NET ENERGY MAY METERING OR ANY M. TARA AND CURRENTLY THE WAY THAT WORKS IS. YOUR CONSUMPTION IS NETTED AGAINST YOUR USE [inaudible] AND OUR YOU GET CREDIT FOR THAT WHERE WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT. IS IF ANY ACCESS GENERATION. GETS CREDITED AT THE RETAIL RATE. THAT IS A BIG COST SHIFT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS [inaudible] THOSE THAT. WOULD HAVE A MICROCLIMATE FIGHT FOR THEM WITH YET. ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE OF ENERGY IS ALMOST TENFOLD. SO IT WOULD BE A COST SHIFT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. AND SO THAT THAT IS OUR MAJOR. OUR CONCERN AND WITHOUT THAT ENDS MY COMMENTS. BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VALOR TELEFON HOST SPECIFIC GAS ELECTRIC COMPANY -- THE POSSESSIVE AT PTT HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS -- THE THE ANALYSIS -- MENTIONS THAT THE BILL HAS SOME -- ANTI COST SHIFTING LANGUAGE ANAHIT FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM BUT IN THE BEEN THE BULLETS AND THEN ALICE'S THOSE WEREN'T SPECIFICALLY -- LAID OUT SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT IF A IF A TARIFF IS IS DEVELOPED. IT WOULD BE WITHOUT I'M SHIFTING COSTS TO THE NON PARTICIPATING -- CUSTOMERS -- WE ALSO LIKE TO JUST CLARIFY IT IT'S JUST NOT COMPLETELY IMPLIED -- IN IN THE WRITE UP THAT -- THE SPECIFIC -- AS A REFERENCE TO THE NET ENERGY METERING PROCEEDING -- AS THE HOUSE TO HOUSE THIS DISCUSSION WOULD BE OUT WE DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE -- AND AND THE SPECIFIC -- LANGUAGE SAYS THAT -- DISCUSSES -- UP IN THE BILL ABOUT IT A NET ENERGY METERING TYPE TARIFF-- WOULD BE OUT -- AND THERE'S IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THIS THE RIGHT UP IS A JUST A COMPLETE -- SORT OF RE WRITE OF THE LANGUAGE BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR IF -- THE IMAGE THE LANGUAGE IMPACTING -- FOSSEL. BACKUP GENERATION WOULD BE OUT WE WROTE IN OUR LETTER OF OPPOSITION THAT. WE FELT LIKE THAT WAS A BIG IMPEDIMENT -- TO COMPLETELY CREATING A RELIABLE SOURCE FOR CUSTOMER. IN THE SITUATION WHERE THE MICROCREDIT HAS TO ISLAND -- THOSE TYPES OF BACKUP GENERATION DO RECEIVE LOCAL AIR PERMITS -- AND WE WE DIDN'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK AND IN THE SENATE. I'M WE THINK THAT THE ANALYSIS TAKES GREAT STRIDES IN ON IMPROVING THE BELT DEFTLY. STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU. I THANK YOU. YOU'VE YOU'VE MADE A GOOD POINT AS IT RELATES TO THE COST SHIFTING SO WE'RE THINKING PROCESSING THAT IS THE TESTIMONY CONTINUES. CENTER WILL LOOK FOR YOUR SPEAR COMMENTS ON THAT AS WELL -- WILL NOW RECEIVE OTHERS WHO ARE HERE TO STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. PATRICK WELCH FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION A WE OPPOSE THE PRIOR VERSION THE BILL WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIGEST AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD. TO A TALK WITH THE AUTHOR MOVING FORWARD THINKING [inaudible] THANK. NOT CLUB THE SUIT ON BEHALF OF SMUD HOW LONG MISTER MANNING IS CORRECT THAT THE ONLY CURE YOU CURRENTLY IN THE BILL I WILL BE LADWP. US MONIES NOT FAR BELOW THE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND NUMBER AND NOW WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WITH THE GREAT ECONOMIC GROWTH HAPPENING IN SACRAMENTO -- WE WILL SOON BE INCLUDED -- WE ARE TAKING A LOOK TO SEE HOW SOON THAT WILL HAPPEN HERE -- AND WILL CONTINUE -- TO I HAVE OPPOSED US IN A POSITION AND WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE [inaudible] PERFECT. OKAY WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE AND TO ME DOCTOR PAUL. FOR SO. ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS SECTION. FOUR ARE ALL OF THOSE YOU MEANT IT ALL OF THOSE AMENDMENTS THIS. THE COURT SICK CRITERION THE VOLATILITY BEING TAKEN. YES WITH THE THE MODIFICATION THAT THAT -- MISTER CHAIR MENTIONED -- ON THAT. THIRD BULLET ON THE SIXTH PAGE. OKAY WHICH IT AND LET ME JUST LOOK AT THAT THAT'S SO THAT'S THAT I THINK HE USED THE WORDS DEVELOP INSTEAD OF DETERMINE IF AND THEN -- INSTEAD OF ARE NECESSARY AS NEXUS. OKAY. AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT COST SHIFTING ISSUES IF THERE ARE ANY YET SO THERE THERE WAS PROVISIONAL ALREADY. I CAN I CAN I SPEAK TO THAT AND THEN THEM QUESTION ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T MIND SO. WE WE THERE'S A ROOM. THERE'S A REASON -- WHERE WHERE'D WHERE NOT WHERE THE COMMITTEE AND HOUSE I GUESS WASN'T SPECIFIC ABOUT CALLING OUT NAM I THINK THAT WOULD BE THIS WOULD STE THE AMENDMENTS WOULD STRIKE THE NAM REQUIREMENT IN THE CURRENT BILL ENTIRELY? THAT THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTAND IT'S OKAY I THINK THAT'S THAT'S BEEN STRICKEN AND THEN -- AS TO YOUR YOUR QUESTION THE COST SHIFTING. I'M I'M I'M OPEN AT YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE YOU'VE ALREADY GOT ON PAGE SEVENTY EXISTING BILL ABOUT YOU KNOW. MINIMIZING COSTS MAXIMIZING BENEFITS ALL RATEPAYERS AS AYE AYE HE'LL WORK ON THE I'M OPEN TO WORK OKAY. NOT ALL MOVE THE BILL. YEAH MY WAS SOMEWHAT. AGAIN ALONG THE SAME LINES AND ALSO ON THE ISSUE OF OUR OUR OVER ARCHING TRY TO LOOK AT THIS COMPREHENSIVELY LAST WEEK WE PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. SB SEVEN HUNDRED WHICH ALSO TALKED ABOUT STORAGE THE AT SOME BAR. CARVE OUT FOR LOW INCOME TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE. M. -- AT THE INVESTMENTS WHEN INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES BUT THEN THAT. COSTA SHIFTED AROUND THERE SO I JUST. AS WE KEEP DEVELOPING NEW PROGRAMS AND WE KEEP SAYING LET'S LOOK OUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS HAVING TO PAY FOR IT -- LAST WEEK WE DID ONE THIS WEEK WE'RE DOING ONE AB. BUT DOES NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AS WOULD LOOK AT WHO PAYS FOR THE SENATE AND WHO BENEFITS YES ABSOLUTELY -- I'M COMMITTED TO THAT AND AND POTENTIAL EXPORT YOURSELF EVER IT JUST HOW. TO ENSURE NO IMPACT ON THIS ADVANCED REASON ACTUALLY THERE MAY BE SOME GOOD PROSPECTS IN THOSE COMMITTEES BUT I AGREEMENT ON A BILL THAT AND THEN HEARD OTHER FOLKS AROUND SO APPRECIATE THAT -- SO THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT THAT. PO YOU I SEE ANYWAY ISSUE TOO BUT THAT'S YOUR MATE LET ME JUST QUICKLY ACTUALLY HAVE A SECOND YEAH DON'T AGREE TO HAVE A SECOND OKAY PLEASE -- SO TO THE CONCERNED -- FROM DWP ABOUT SORT OF BEING THE THE LAST MUNY LEFT STANDING HERE. I'M I'M OPEN TO THAT THE THE CONCEPT THAT SEE ANYWAY PUT FORWARD THAT SORT OF OP DIDN'T FRAMEWORK. BUT I YOU KNOW I DEFER TO YOU MISTER CHAIR IN TERMS OF HOW HOW YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION GOING FORWARD AYE AYE. WE DON'T WANT TO FORCE ANY MUNICIPAL A MUNICIPAL UTILITIES INTO THIS FRAMEWORK UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO BE THERE AND THEY'RE GETTING THOSE REQUESTS AND THEY THEY WANT TO BE IN THE MIX SO IF. IF THEY DON'T WANT IN ARE GOING TO REJECT THOSE THINGS WERE WILLING TO COMMENT THAT SO ANYHOW I JUST WANT TO FLAG THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. I'M OPEN TO WORKING THROUGH AND TRYING. TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION OR AT LEAST WORK THROUGH THEIR OUTSTANDING TONE I I THINK THAT'S FAIR OF WELL AS I SAID WE THIS BEING A COMPRESSED PERIOD OF TIME -- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE MOVING FOR THE THOUGHTFUL WAY BUT AS I MENTIONED TO I THINK THAT WEAVES PRESCRIBE IT PRETTY GOOD BUT I AM. OPEN TO HAVING CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH ON THE SET UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THERE'S BEEN A MOTION A SECOND -- DID YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS THIS THE MOTION IS DO -- DO PASS -- TO APPROPRIATIONS AS AMENDED. AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OF FOR THE RECORD THAT YOU ARE A SECOND TO NONE IN THIS AREA IN EUROPE AND ENERGY INTEREST IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS. THESE -- DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE -- TECHNOLOGIES AND WE APPRECIATE THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP -- AND I WE APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND WHAT IT DOES TO SORT OF ALLOW THE PROCESS TO CONTINUE MOVE ON BE CLEARER -- FOR DEVELOPERS TO BE OUT THERE AND START. MAKING THEIR WAY EFFICIENTLY THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THAT THIS BILL REPRESENTS AND APPRECIATE LOS I I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND ACTUALLY SHAPING THIS IN TO AYE EVEN CLEAR FRAMEWORK AND YOU KNOW. WHETHER IT'S HOSPITAL IN YOUR COMMUNITY A SENSITIVE SCHOOL SITE. MILITARY INSTALLATIONS ARE LOOKING THIS. SCHOOLS OTHER PLACES WHERE SENIOR USER ARE AT RISK WE THINK THAT THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT CLEAN DISTRIBUTED ENERGY THIS IS ABOUT. PUBLIC SAFETY AND A MORE RESILIENT CREATE SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE OKAY. A ROLL CALL THE MOTION. HOLDEN BY. PULLING AYE PATTERSON. PATTERSON NO. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I BURKE. BURKE AYE CHEN. GEN AYE BUT CUNNINGHAM. I AM NOT VOTING EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE GALLAGHER. EDUARDO GARCIA MAYES. MAYES AYE. MURATSUCHI AYE MURATSUCHI AYE QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE REYES SANTIAGO [inaudible] TING [inaudible] TING AYE. TELL YOUR BILL IS OUT WILL KEEP THEIR OPEN FANGRAPHS INVENTORS THINK. I WILL NOW MOVE -- TO I'D OF FILE ITEM TEN SP. THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN SENATE HEARING GOOD OR IS YOUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I LIKE TO BEGIN BY. A ACCEPTING THAT COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS -- AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU CAN GO TO PAGE SEVEN IT'S ALL STILL LITTLE. NEW FOR ME TOO SO I'M I'M GETTING THROUGH ITS A IT'S A PARED DOWN BILL BUT I THINK YOU CAN STILL ACCOMPLISH THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF OF OUR OF OUR BILL HERE WHICH IS. TO PUSH THE PEACE% YOU SEE TO REALLY CONSIDER THE THE POTENTIAL THAT ENERGY STORAGE HAS TO IMPROVING THE RESILIENCY OF OUR GREAT IN THAT. TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL WAY NO WAY THAT DOES IT YOU KNOW THAT THAT GOES -- BOTH WITH THIRD PARTY DEVELOPERS AND WITH UTILITY OWNERSHIP I THINK WE'RE PUTTING OUT AN IMPORTANT MARKER HERE. TO TO REALLY ALLOW UTILITIES -- TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS MARKETPLACE BUT AT THE SAME TIME KEEPING -- THOSE THIRD PARTY DEVELOPERS OF THE TABLE TO AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE COALITION THAT'S BEEN BUILT HERE IT'S IT'S UNIQUE TO SEE -- BOATS BOTH SIDES SORT OF PLAYING TOGETHER AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH ROOM FOR EVERYBODY IN THE FUTURE OF ENERGY STORAGE -- SO -- I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS IN STAKEHOLDER GROUPS OUT THERE AND I JUST INITIALLY WANTED EXPRESS MY OPENNESS. TO TO WORKING WITH THOSE WHO STILL HAVE OUTSTANDING CONCERN NEW BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AND AND NOT IN A WAY THAT -- PREEMPTS OR IN ANY WAY -- AND AROUND THE EXISTING CPU SEE -- FRAMEWORK ON THE IRP PROCESS -- WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF? KEEP THAT MOVING BUT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO SPEAK UP AND AND LET THEM KNOW THAT ENERGY STORAGE BE APART THAT MIX. I WITH THAT [inaudible] S. RIVAL [inaudible] IF YOU [inaudible] AWARENESS. OH YES GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S KALIKA SONOMA VICE PRESIDENT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ENERGY PROCUREMENT AND A WHOLESALE MARKET OPERATIONS -- THIS BILL IS IS FIRST ABOUT RELIANCE ON ENERGY STORAGE UNITS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY -- TO HELP US TO INSURE A RELIABLE GRAD -- SECOND THIS BILLS ALSO ABOUT -- DETERMINE WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND OPERATING A RELIABILITY BASED ENERGY STORAGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CUSTOMERS -- AS BE -- THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH A CONTRACTED ENERGY STORAGE AND COMPETITIVE UTILITY SCALE. OR ENERGY STORAGE ARE AND IT'S ALL DESIGNED TO BE LOCATED ON STRATEGIC LOCATIONS ON OUR ELECTRIC RED. LOBSTER THAT UTILITIES HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TOOLS THEY NEED TO SAFELY RELIABLY OPERATOR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. A PARTICULAR AS WE REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON GAS FIRED A GENERATION AS WE HEARD EARLIER HERE TODAY. AND OUT WE HAVE A AND M. EMERGING NEED TO INTEGRATE VERY LARGE LEVELS OF RENEWABLES -- THAT YES PIECE AND CA'S ARE GONNA NEED TO DEVELOP IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. OH IS THEY BEGIN TO MEET THEIR LONG TERM OUR PS REQUIREMENTS SET PURSUANT TO S. B. -- THREE FIFTY TWENTY CLEAR WHAT THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED DO ITS ITS NOT INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE NON RELIABILITY USES OF ENERGY STORAGE CUSTOMERS -- SHOULD STILL UP YOUR STORAGE FOR BEHIND THE METER USES SO WHETHER THEY BE AYE ACTUAL DEMAND SIDE CUSTOMERS ARE GENERATORS THAT USE ENERGY STORED BY THE METER -- WE WOULD STILL -- LOOK TO AND ENTITIES TO USE ENERGY STORAGE FOR OTHER PURPOSES SUCH AS THAT DEFERRING OUT TRADITIONAL WIRES UPGRADES AND PILOT PROGRAMS IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED -- THAT THAT BILL HAD A REQUIREMENT THAT THE UTILITIES WOULD CONTRACT FOR THE INITIAL TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS AND POTENTIALLY OWN UP 250%. OF THE BILL SINCE BEEN AMENDED THAT THAT'S THEIR RELIABILITY BASED ENERGY STORAGE REQUIRE A REQUIREMENT BE ALLOCATED TO ALL CCA'S DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS AND UTILITIES. ARE I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT ALSO HAS A CONCERN WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT'S THE IT IS THE OPERATION OF THE ENERGY STORED ITSELF THAT'S CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING A RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE GREAT OPERATIONS. AND IT IS ONLY THE UTILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE CPC IN FEDERAL REGULATORS -- CCA'S AND YES PEAS ARE NOT DIRECTLY REGULATED BY THE CPC AND IF WE REQUIRE THEM TO PROCURE THIS RELIABILITY BASED ENERGY STORAGE. OF DEL OPERATED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS -- IN CASE OF A OF A DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDER AND THEY SHOULD. ALL UTILITIES ON THE OTHER HAND IS YOU MAY BE AWARE DON'T MAKE MONEY AND IN THE ENERGY PROCUREMENT BUSINESS A WE ARE REQUIRED BY COMMISSION RULE TO BETTER RESOURCES AT THEIR ACTUAL COSTS. SO THAT THE GRID CAN OPERATE EFFICIENTLY AND AFFORDABLY AND RELIABLY FOR ALL CUSTOMERS. BUT THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER ABOUT ALLOCATION ALL CUSTOMERS IS IT'S JUST NOT ALTS USING ALL A LOAD SERVING AS IT'S JUST NOT PRACTICAL. IF YOU THINK ABOUT A SITUATION WHERE IF WE HAD A HUNDRED MEGAWATT REQUIREMENT INPALM SPRINGS WOULD YOU REALLY WANT SOMEBODY LIKE LANCASTER OR PEOPLE RIVERA. TO HAVE TO DO A HALF OF MEG A LOT PROCUREMENT ENERGY STORAGE AND PALM SPRINGS OR DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THE UTILITY DO IT. ARE AND HAVE IT TAKE ADVANTAGE ECONOMY OF SCALES AND IMPORTANTLY BE ABLE DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL LOCATION FOR THAT STORAGE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT ITS USE BEST MEETS THE GRAD AGAIN UNDER THE FULL OVERSIGHT OF THE CPUC. AND THEN -- FINALLY JUST WANT -- TO A REMIND EVERYONE THAT HOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE CCA MODELS GOING TO TURN OUT AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE S. P. MODELS GOING TO TURN OUT -- IT MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL IT THEY MAY NOT BE EVER IF. IF IT DOES CHANGE OVER TIME AND WE'VE ALLOCATED ENERGY STORAGE REQUIREMENTS TO THEM HOW DO WE AS A STATE ENSURE THAT THAT ENERGY STORAGE IS THEN AVAILABLE TO THE UTILITIES UNDER THE CPU SEES OVERSIGHT. FERRETTE MEETING CRITICAL GREAT DATA -- OPERATIONS -- ALT RESPECTFULLY REMIND THIS COMMITTEE THAT CALIFORNIA'S INFAMOUS AT ENERGY CRISIS WAS THE RESULT OF CRITICALLY NEEDED RESOURCES NOT BEING OPERATED. BY ENTITIES -- THAT RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIABILITY -- AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT OUR SB THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN IT'S INTENDED. TO TREAT ENERGY STORAGE NO DIFFERENT THAN POLES AND WIRES IT DELIVERS ELECTRICITY WHEN CUSTOMERS NEED IT WHERE THEY NEED IT. AND AND THAT IS A UTILITY FUNCTION. BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED -- EXPLICIT WITNESS. OKAY GIVEN BIRTH GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JANICE LYNN. ON THE CO FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY STORAGE ALLIANCE. I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA'S STUCK IT'S GREAT EXPORT WE HAVE AND ONE THING'S CLEAR AND I THINK ONE THING WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THE DOC IS GETTING STUCK HERE IN FACT IT'S LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE AN OSTRICH. IN TWENTY AND THE REASON IS IS THE NECK BONNAT LOAD RAMP IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT NET LOAD RAMP WAS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. ACCORDING TO THE CASE SO BY. TWENTY TWENTY THAT KNACK THAT MAXIMUM THREE OUR NET LOAD RAMP WILL EXCEED SIXTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. THAT'S JUST TWO YEARS FROM NOW. TO MEET THIS NEED WE NEED TO CONTRACT FOR FLEXIBILITY NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT SB THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN DIRECTS. SO JUST REALLY BRIEFLY ONE I WANTED TO SAY ABOUT ENERGY STORAGE IS IT IT IS THE ULTIMATE FLEXIBILITY TOOL. IT REPRESENTS A VERY BROAD ASSET CLASS EVERYTHING FROM THERMAL STORAGE CAN BE LIKE CITED ANYWHERE AROUND THE CURRENT TO VERY LARGE PULP TIGHTROPE. IT COULDN'T -- OUT. PERFORM MULTIPLE SERVICES EVEN FROM THE SAME ASSET IT CAN BE REPROGRAMMED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AND THIS WILL AND THEN I'LL WRAP UP. ENERGY STORAGE CAN BE DEPLOYED WITH THE ASSETS WE ALREADY HAVE. SO IT YOU KNOW IT'S IN THE DISCUSSION EARLIER. FOSSIL PLANTS WHEN THEY RAN UP AND THEIR GOAL THEIR RAMPING UP AND DOWN THEY'RE NOT VERY EFFICIENT THEY PRODUCE A LOT OF POLLUTION. INTEGRATING STORAGE WITH A FOSSIL PLAN CAN ABSORB THAT LOAD FOLLOWING THAT FLEXIBILITY AND ALLOW THE UNDERLYING ASSET TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY MORE AFFORDABLY AND CLEANER. SO IN SUMMARY S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN REPRESENTS A SMART NO REGRETS INSURANCE FOR A CLEANER MORE AFFORDABLE CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR MEMBRANE WHITE HERE ON BEHALF OF RECURRENT ENERGY WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF BILL READ RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS THEY ENERGY STORAGE CAN HAPPEN BUILDING MORE PROJECTS. AND SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL LIKE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH IN BEHALF OF THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS IN THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES WELL WERE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN WE BUT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. CHAIR MEMBERS TWENTY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF ADVANCED MICRO GOOD SOLUTIONS AND THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION INSTRUCTS SUPPORT. MR CHAIRING COMMITTEE TERESA BURKE* ON BEHALF OF CERES AND SUPPORT. A MAN ON THE OFFICE YOUR CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- WILL NOW RECEIVE. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO BILL [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] ROOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JASON I COULD WITH EDELSTEIN GILBERT WROTE ROBESON AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICE ASSOCIATION. CALCI CA WHICH REPRESENTS THE OPERATIONAL COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS IN CALIFORNIA COME AND AND I'M JUSTICE OF PREVARICATION YOU'RE ADDRESSING THE BILL AS AMENDED. ADDRESSING THE BILL AS AMENDED SIR AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND WILL CONFINE MY COMMENTS TO THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL -- WHICH DOESN'T AS FAR AS I CAN TELL -- RELATE TO RESILIENCY RELIABILITY IS SUPPOSED TO BE AMENDED -- KELSEY CA DE. DOES NOT HAVE A A A A PROJECTION TO THE FRAMEWORK IN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. BOB BUT THEIR CONCERN GOES TO THEIR PROCUREMENT AUTONOMY THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION OF THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER BUT COMMITTEE CHOICE AGGREGATORS ARE. LOCAL WE GOVERNED AT PUBLIC BODIES AND AS SUCH THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME. CHAIRMAN OVERSIGHT RULES AND REQUIRE. MANDATES FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION INSTEAD THERE. CHAIRMAN IS GOVERNED LOCALLY AND THE LOCALS GET TO SET THE TAR AND THE THE THE THE MEANS BY WHICH THEY ARE GONNA THE TARGETS INCLUDING THE ONES THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED IN THIS BILL -- ARE ISSUES AT THIS POINT I ARE ARE REALLY CONFINED TO THE LANGUAGE PROPOSED UNSUB DE. UM IT RELATES TO AGAIN WHETHER OR NOT WE GET TO MAINTAIN OUR PROCUREMENT ECONOMY. IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR GIVEN THAT THE LANGUAGE IS REQUIRING THAT A C. C. A. OR OTHER LOAD SERVING ANY MAKE A SHOWING -- THAT -- A RESOURCE IS COST EFFECTIVE AND VIABLE WHO THAT SHOWING IS GOING TO BE MADE. TO IF IT'S THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THAT WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF HOW WE'VE TRADITIONALLY BEEN TREATED AS LOAD SERVING ENTITIES AGAIN BECAUSE THE CPUC DOES NOT. HAVE THE AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW TO SET PROCUREMENT FOR US AND THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION THAT WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT UTILITY OWN GENERATION FOR THE 50% -- CCA'S OUR LOAD SERVING ENTITIES THAT ARE COVERED BY THE AMENDMENTS HOWEVER WE ARE. UTILITIES SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN. TIME WE BELIEVE THAT. PLEASE CONCERNS COULD BE EASILY ADDRESSED BY BY SIMPLY CLARIFYING THAT THAT CCA'S LOAD SERVING ENTITIES CONTINUE TO HAVE. CHAIRMAN AUTONOMY THAT THEY ALWAYS HAVE UNDER EXISTING STATUTE -- BUT ABSENT THAT AMENDMENT WE CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. TED REGULARLY GROUPS. TED REGULARLY WITH S. T. GENIE AGAIN ARM AS THE BILL AS AMENDED BY COMMITTEE ON WE STILL ARE OPPOSED BUT AS I STATED IN THE LAST BILL. IT IT GETS US QUITE OF A WAY THERE. THE ONE ISSUE WE HAVE IS WITH ITEM DE. THE TALKS ABOUT. OUR OWNERSHIP -- WE ARE TOTALLY SUPPORT -- VARIOUS ENTITIES. UP ENERGY ARE OWNING ENERGY STORAGE BUT IT REALLY IS DRIVEN BY USE CASE AND HOW THE ENERGY. A STORAGE IS BEING UTILIZED SO FOR THAT REASON WE DON'T THINK THAT OWNERSHIP COULD BE CUT SHOULD BE CODIFIED IN THE BILL. AND WITHOUT THEM ALSO THAT THAT SAID IN CLOSING IN THEN CANCER ANY HARD QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE OKAY -- WILL RECEIVE ANYONE ELSE WHO'S HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE DOCTOR JEAN NELSON CALIFORNIA'S REGAIN NUCLEAR POWER INCORPORATED ARM IF YOU CAREFULLY STUDY OF FOR TO FORM ONE DAVIS ARE YOU SIR. ASSURE SAID ONLY NAME AND ORGANIZATION OKAY WELL. WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ENERGY STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT BEING USED RIGHT. WORKING CARVE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK REALLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS ARE TAKEN TODAY I'M AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OTHERS OFFICE ON JUST ONE OR TWO TWO WEEKS IN CONCERT THAT WAS TO HAVE. PERFECT -- WILL TURN OUT TO MEMBERS DOCTOR QUIRK. YES SO -- THE OPPOSITION OF CCA'S IS A PERFECT OUR EXAMPLE. OF WHY IT IS BEEN FOOLISH FRANKLY TOO BALKANIZED OUR SYSTEM. THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS BILL. IS YOU CAN'T GET. ECONOMIES OF SCALE UNLESS YOU CAN ALSO CAUSE THE CCA'S. OUGHT TO BUY YEN AND THAT'S THE POINT OF THE BILL WITH ITS AMENDMENTS. AND SO IF THE CCA'S TRYING GET OUT OF THIS I WILL BE. ARE VERY UPSET BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO WAY TO GET LARGE SCALE SO STORAGE UNLESS THEY'RE PART OF THIS. AND BALKANIZED IN THE SYSTEMS WITH MANY CCA'S HAS NOT HELPED US OUT WILL NOT GIVE US RELIABLE ENERGY -- I THINK I'VE SAID ENOUGH I'M VOTING FOR THE BILL AS AMENDED THANK YOU. IF I COULD CLARIFY MISTER CHAIRMAN. WE DON'T NEED YOUR ANSWER AT THIS -- BUT WITH ALL RESPECT TO MEMBERS SATISFIED. ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. AS CHAIR I I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT'S HIS USERS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUSTIN TO RESPECTFULLY CLARIFY WOULDN'T. KELSEY CA AND THE COMMITTEE TRUSTS AGGREGATOR COMMUNITY IS NOT LOOKING TO BE. EXEMPT FROM THE BILL ARE NOT HAVE A MANDATE PLACE US IN FACT THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO APPROVE ANY KIND OF A PROCUREMENT MANDATE WE WOULD. PREFER TO SEE IT ON US BECAUSE WE EXIST. TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS. IT TO CLARIFY THE MINUTE WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS JUST TO STIPULATE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HARPER CHAIRMAN AUTONOMY. ON HOW WE MEET THAT MANDATE WHERE WE MEET THAT MANDATE. AND THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET LARGE SCALE STORAGE IF EVERYONE OF THE CCA'S DECIDES HOW THEY CAN DO IT. AND THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I I DON'T NEED A RESPONSE THANK YOU. OKAY -- IF THERE ARE NO OTHER. I KNOW THE COMETS -- YEAH. FIRST SO SENATOR RIGHT YOU DON'T APPLY PRESET YOU WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE THIS IS -- AGAIN ONE OF THOSE BILLS AND A PACKAGE OF BILLS IT'S ADDRESSING AN IMPORTANT AREA ISSUE A RECOGNIZE THE THE DYNAMICS THE ROUTE WITH CCA'S AND YET I APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT. IS BUILT AND SO THIS BILL AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE NEED TO FOCUS ON STORAGE BUT IT YET. CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER PROJECTS TO BE. ARE RECOGNIZED -- AND WITHIN THAT TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS SO I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- THIS IS A DO PASS -- AS AMENDED TO APPROACH. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION -- ENERGY STORAGE IS. THE FUTURE OF OUR GREAT AND WITH ALL THE RENEWABLES TARGETS AND ALL THE OTHER -- CHALLENGES WE HAVE AHEAD I THINK THIS IS A AYE NO REGRETS TARGET IN THE BILL -- AND I APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WITH THE KIND OF SCALE WERE LOOKING AT IT PROJECTS ALL OVER THE STATE IT MAY BE MUCH MORE THAT'S NEEDED AND THAT'S WHY -- THEM PRODUCTS IF THE AMENDMENTS AND APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THE GOING FOR RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AT THE BANK EUROCOPA. HOLDEN AYE HOLDEN AYE PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE PATTERSON AYE. FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMAN AYE BURKE. BURKE AYE CHEN. GEN AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM AYE EGGMAN GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I EDUARDO GARCIA. MAYES. MAYES I MURATSUCHI. MURATSUCHI AYE QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE REYES [inaudible] SANTIAGO [inaudible] TING [inaudible] TING AYE. THE BILL AS OUT A HE PICKED THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU AND YOUR LAST BILL BEFORE US TODAY IS S. B.. FOURTEEN SEVEN SEVEN HERE. AND THIS -- DOES ALSO ENJOY DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GIVE A QUICK SICK TO MY WITNESSES SURE. SO THIS IS THIS PART OF THE TRI FACTOR OF OF BECAUSE YOU'RE SEEING TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE [inaudible] I THINK COLLECTIVELY THEY'RE GOING. TO PLEASE MAKE MY COMMUNITY BACK HOME. IMPORTER RANCH FEEL SAFER KNOWING THAT -- WE'RE LOOKING TO THE FUTURE AND WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO RELY ON THE THE SYSTEMS OF THE PAST AND AND THIS BILL REALLY LOOKS AT THE BUILDING SECTOR AND AND WHAT MORE WE CAN DO. TO ADVANCE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE COSTS TO HOMEOWNERS AND TO ADVANCE ALTERNATIVES -- LIKE ELECTRIC HEAT PUMPS AND OTHER -- ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO REDUCING BOTH THE EMISSIONS PROFILE OF OUR BUILDINGS BUT ALSO MAKE THEM -- EASIER TO OPERATE AND AND LOWER COSTS WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS AND SO THE THAT THE SHAME WOULD BE IS IF WE CHARGED AHEAD IN THIS HOUSING CRISIS. BUILT A WHOLE NEW SET A HOUSING STOCK. STUCK IN THE TWENTY CENTURY SO WE NEED TO OF ALL HERE IN THIS BILL IS A BIG PART OF THAT -- I I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THEM -- AND AS WE DISCUSSED I'M ALSO THERE WAS A COMMENT -- ON PAGE EIGHT ARE CONCERNED REYES THAT I ALSO THINKWE CAN ADDRESS HERE -- THE CONCERN WAS THAT THIS THAT IF WE RAN OUT OF FUNDING -- FOR THIS THESE TWO PROGRAMS THE BILL PROGRAM A TECH PROGRAM THAT YOU'D BE DIPPING IN TWO NEW AUTOMATICALLY NEW PUBLIC PURPOSE CHARGES THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. WE'RE NOT LOOKING -- TO ADD ADDITIONAL COSTS ON TO RATE PAYERS ARE OR TREAT THIS IS A BLANK CHECK AND SO THE CAP ON FUNDING IS IS WELCOME AND AS WELL AS THE SUN SET. UP BUT I DID ONE OFFER THAT IF IF THERE'S OPEN THIS YEAR INTEREST -- NOT JUST LIMITING IT -- TO THAT -- THE GREENHOUSE GAS -- GAS ALLOWANCES -- BUT STILL MAINTAINING SOME FLEXIBILITY WHETHER IT'S TRYING FROM BOTH THE ELECTRIC SECTOR -- THERE'S STILL FUNDING IN NEW SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP OR OTHER EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES BUT BUT NOT -- I'D BE OPEN ALL SAID ADDING SOME KIND A SAVINGS OR OR OR ASSURANCE THAT THIS THERE WOULD BE NO NO LOOK IT AUTOMATICALLY FUNDING THROUGH A NEW PUBLIC PURPOSE CHARGE THAT. THERE REALLY IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A BACK DOOR HER NEW RATE PAYER FUNDED PROGRAMS --BUT I WILL BE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I HAVE A VERY UNIQUE COALITION HERE WHEN YOU HAVE ENTERED THE SEA AND THE DEVELOPERS ON BOARD ON THE SAME BILL -- I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING THEY ARE OFTEN AT ODDS BUT I THINK. BOTH SIDES SEE A REAL FUTURE HERE NOW IN A MORE ADVANCED BUILDING SECTOR WITH WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK WRAP UP SECOND. IF THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND -- IS THERE IN ORDER. TO THE WITNESSES THAT YOU LIKE TO DON'T JUST BE REAL BRIEF BECAUSE I THINK OTHER STEPS. UP. ANTI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SCOTT SHELL THE PRINCIPLE WITH E. HPD ARCHITECTS IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE ABOUT SIXTY PEOPLE THE PROJECT SOME PEOPLE KNOW OF OURS IS THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM -- WE'VE DESIGNED ABOUT OF A DOZEN ALL ELECTRIC ZERO ENERGY BUILDINGS IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. FOR WE STARTED IT WAS HARD AND THEY WERE MORE EXPENSIVE AND I'M PLEASED TO FEEL SB HERE TODAY AND SAY. OF THERE'S NOT A COST PREMIUM RIGHT NOW WE'RE DESIGNING THESE WITHIN OUR CLIENTS CONVENTIONAL BUDGETS -- WE COMPARE RANGE OF DIFFERENT HEATING SYSTEMS WE HAVE THE CONTRACTOR'S PRICE THEM AND THE PRICES ARE COMING AN EQUAL TO THE GAS SYSTEM. IF WE CAN ELIMINATE THE GAS SERVICE WE CAN SAVE MONEY WE JUST DID THAT ON A SCHOOL AND SAVE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS -- WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THINGTO DO I WENT OUT TO SEVEN OF OUR LEADING MECHANICAL ENGINEERS AND ASK THEM THEY AGREED THAT WERE READY TO GO ALL ELECTRIC. THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS JUST SLOW TO CHANGE IT NEEDS A PUSH. MOST OF THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO DO WHAT THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE AND THEY NEED A LITTLE PUSH TO GET MOVING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S IVY HUMANIST ATTITUDE IF RATTLING DEFENSE. A PUBLIC POLICY ORGANIZATION ARE DEDICATED TO EMPOWERING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ADVANCING VIOLENCE OF JUSTICE AND ASSURING JOB CREATION PARTICULARLY GREEN SECTOR. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT THIS BILL ESPECIALLY BECAUSE 30% -- SET ASIDE THAT HAS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING AND OTHER NEW BUILDINGS LOCATED IN LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THIS COURT I WILL ENSURE THAT NEWLY CONSTRUCTED OF LOW INCOME HOUSING -- AND OTHER QUALIFYING BUILDINGS ARE BUILT WITH NEAR ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY FROM THE ONSET INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON RENOVATIONS WE H. YOU KNOW TEND TO BE COSTLIER IN THE LONG RUN. ALSO HAS BEFORE TWO SEVEN SEVEN TARGET DEPLOYMENT OF LOW. EMISSION SPACE AND WATER HEATING TECHNOLOGY THOUGH INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY OF ENERGY FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WHILE ALSO IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND THIS WILL ENSURE EQUITABLE DEPLOYMENT OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH LOW LOW INCOME HOUSING -- HOUSEHOLD OFTEN CANNOT AFFORD AND THUS MUST WAIT UNTIL TECHNOLOGY BECOMES AFFORDABLE TO REAP ITS BENEFITS WHILE WEALTHIER HOUSEHOLDS ENJOY THE BENEFITS MUCH OLD MUCH EARLIER -- LASTLY -- DID OF THIS BILL PRIDE JOB TRAINING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. WORK FOR DEVELOPERS HE'S ARE NEEDED IN THE GREEN SECTOR TO ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS RECEIVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS. BOTH IN THE FORM OF UTILITY SAVINGS PLAN IMPLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT OF JUST RESPECTFULLY URGE AIR AYE VOTE TODAY AND THINK -- THIS YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR FAIRIES EFFORTLESS -- WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE NOT EFFORTLESS. AND THE PURPOSE TO PLAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CASSIE GILSON ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY AND SO STRONG SUPPORT AND I THINK THAT AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS WORK ON THIS ISSUE. I'M AS WE LOOK TO DRIVE DOWN -- RESIDENTIAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE NEED PROGRAMS LIKE THIS TO DO THAT AT ANY SCALE YOU'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE NEW SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP. AND WE FOUND THAT THAT PROGRAM WAS PRETTY. THE LEVEL OF MYERS SAIDTHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT COMFORTABLE AND LIVABLE. I'M WE THINK THIS PROGRAM WILL BE SIMILARLY SUCCESSFUL AND FOR THAT REASON STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU ARE OTHERS HERE TO LEND THEIR VOICE IN SUPPORT. NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLACE ERICA MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF EARTH JUSTICE IN SUPPORT. A MAN ON THE OFFICE HERE OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. REX W.

DO ANY HUNTER FOR THE CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY IN SUPPORT MACLEOD STAY ON BEHALF OF SMART IN SUPPORT. ON A FOR AIR WITH THE SCHOOL ENERGY COALITION IN SUPPORT. HAD GO TO THE CALIFORNIA SPEED TO THE CESSATION IN SUPPORT. OKAY WILL ENTERTAIN A COMMENTS FROM THOSE WHO WERE IN. OPPOSITION TO THE BILL YOU OFFER [inaudible] IT'S I HAVEN'T GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VALERIE TRAIL OF LAJOS PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY -- WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- HAVING -- IF EV AT SOME PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH -- OF THE AUTHOR AND SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. ON THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES DOES -- GO A LONG WAY TO IMPROVE THE BELL RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR CPUC ADMINISTRATION SO THAT THE IF MONIES ARE COLLECTED FROM A INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY CUSTOMERS. THE DOES THE BENEFIT STATE -- SETS IT YEAH I AM A TAP ON THE PROGRAM THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THAT. AND THEN SOME SORT OF SOME ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT -- IT WITH WITH THE SUNSET DATE I TESTIFIED SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE -- I AND YOU KNOW THE LITANY OF IDEA. AND REALLY RELATING THE BILL KIND OF TO THE NEW SOUL HOMES PARTNERSHIP BEEN AND HOW WE CAN LEARN FROM FROM OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ON ON THE BOOKS THAT ARE. REGULATORS ARE ARE HELPING US EMPLOYMENT IN IT IN ADMINISTER -- AND THE REASON IT'S OF SOME MY TESTIMONY TODAY IS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT SPECIFIC IS BECAUSE PETER. IS REALLY TRYING TO SOME OF THE WORDS I'VE USED WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS ON THAT HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THIS BILL IT'S WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO DIG DEEP. AND ARE THINKING IN THIS COMPRESSED PERIOD OF TIME AND THINK UP A PRODUCTIVE WAY TO SHAPE THE SPELL -- AND SO -- IN TERMS OF THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CAP WE THINK ACTUAL LEAVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS I'M GOING TO BE A BETTER WAY TO GO -- WE THINK FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE COULD BE IS IT ANNUALLY COULD BE USED FOR THE ATTACK PROGRAM THAT'S A PROMISING PROGRAM THAT WE SEE -- TO LOOK AT UPSTREAM -- WAYS TO WORK WITH OUR MANUFACTURERS ARE DISTRIBUTORS POSSIBLY SOME THAT THE DEVELOPERS DIRECTLY. ON DEAL WITH WE KNOW THAT THE CDC IS ALREADY GONNA REQUIRING TWENTY TWENTY ZERO NET ENERGY BUILDINGS WHICH THEN WE HEARD TESTIMONY THAT THEIR BASIC ON PAR WITH THE MARKET. BUT NEVERTHELESS -- THERE'S GONNA BE A REQUIREMENT ON THE BUILDING ENVELOPE ARE READY. AND WE THINK THAT IF WE ENCOURAGE MANUFACTURERS YOU KNOW. ATTITUDE TO WORK WITH DEVELOPERS AND GIVES PUT SOMETHING OUT THERE ON THE SHELVES THAT WOULDN'T THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT OUT WE THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE I THINK WHAT THE BILL SAYS THAT'S NEW BUILT -- AND ALSO WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT THAT ACTUALLY IS BEYOND TITLE. TWENTY FOUR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE -- WE ALSO THINK THAT ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE IN THE BILL PROGRAM AND THIS IS WHERE WE'VE REALLY JUST HOT OFF THE PRESSES COME OFF OF WORK A DISCUSSION THIS MORNING -- WHERE WE THINK THAT -- THAT BACK OF THE ENVELOPE COULD GO INTO OVER -- THIRTY THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING TO COVER THE COSTS -- THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL THAT WE SEE BETWEEN CHOOSING THE TRADITIONAL TECHNOLOGY OR NOW GOING -- FOR MAINLY OUR CALCULATIONS FOR THE HEAT PUMP ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP FIVE FOR WATER HEATING AND SPACE HEATING -- WE ALSO THINK THAT -- YOU COULD STRICTLY FOCUS THAT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOW INCOME AREAS -- BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATORS JUST HAD RECENTLY HAD A BIG DEBATE ON THAT AND THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT WE CAN COMPLEMENT LIKE. THE SET ASIDE IN S. CHIP THAT'S FOR LOW INCOME -- MISS EGGMAN'S -- PROGRAM -- THREE AND MAYBE -- OTHER THE OTHER PROGRAM REFERENCE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THE EP YOU SEE -- HAS -- HAS RECENTLY ADOPTED I'M A FEW MILLION DOLLARS FOR MEASUREMENT EVALUATION ETCETERA. WHERE P. GENIE CANNOT ACCEPT -- LANGUAGE IS HAVE OUR GAS CUSTOMERS PAID FOR THE FUEL SWITCH TO ELECTRIFICATION -- IT AND TO TELL YOU WHY WE'RE OPPOSED TO THAT IS BECAUSE THINK OF THE DYNAMIC RETAIL MARKET THAT WE HAVE NOW. AND BUNDLED CUSTOMERS ARE LEAVING AND OTHERS ARE LEFT BEHIND AND THERE'S FEWER CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR FIXED COSTS SO. WE DO NOT WANT A SCENARIO WHERE WE ARE HAVING GAS CUSTOMERS THAT PAID FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE SYSTEM. AND OTHERS ARE LEFT BEHIND WITH FIXED COSTS SO WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE -- GAS CUSTOMERS -- PAPER PAPER THIS PROGRAM -- AND SO I'M AS YOU CAN SEE I HOPE YOU AGREE THAT WE'VE REALLY THOUGHT HARD -- ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK FOR THIS PROGRAM. I'M WE HAVEN'T -- COMPLETELY FINISHED PROPOSING -- AMENDMENTS TO THE ALL -- BUT THOSE ARE ALONG THE LINES -- OF WHAT WE'RE THINKING SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR ALLOWING ME THE TIME AS THE SOLE WITNESS ON THIS OPPOSITION SIDE OF THE BILL. YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME -- IS THERE ANY IS THERE ANYONE HERE WHO IS. NOT TO TESTIFY BUT JUST. TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY WELL I GUESS YOU WERE THE LONE VOICE OF OPPOSITION. THAT BATTLE -- WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM BEYOND IT [inaudible] EXETER DOT. SELECT A QUIRK ASK HER MOM I THOUGHT I THINK IT IS SARAH REALLY IMPORTANT. IF WE FIND A WAY TO GET OFF NATURAL GAS IF WE ARE GOING TO NEED OUR CLIMATE GOALS -- SHOW I AM CERTAINLY ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER IT FELL THANK YOU. OKAY -- JUST SPREADS AT THINGS CHAIR THEM. TO SEE A SENATOR YOU TOO SIR -- SO ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS -- IN REGARDS TO FUNDING YEAH -- NOW THIS READ THIS HERE IT SAYS CONSEQUENTLY OTHER NOT INTENDED BY THE AUTHOR THE FUNDING OF BUILDING TECH FROM ELECTRIC GIGI LANCE'S RESULT IN A NEW POT PURPOSE PROGRAM CHARGE ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS. TO INSURE THAT THIS BILL A PUBLIC PURPOSE CHARGES DOES NOT OCCUR THE COMMITTEE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER LIMITING THE FUNDING. THE BILL THE TEXT NO MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION A YEAR FROM. CHICHI GAS ANNOUNCES I'M ACTUALLY STRUGGLE BUT WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT. AT THAT POINT CAN YOU JUST THAT YEAHSENATE AYE I WAS PRO TOO QUICK IN MY OPENING STATEMENT BUT I I DON'T WANT THIS TO HAVE A SPILLOVER AFFECTED TRIGGER AN AUTOMATIC NEW PUBLIC PURPOSE CHARGE THAT WAS NEVER THE GOAL. BUT I'M SORT OF STUCK HERE BECAUSE NOW I'M HERE FROM THE OPPOSITION THEY DON'T WANT IT TO COME FROM. THE GAS SIDE OF THE UTILITY AYE AYE USING THIS STATE -- PURCHASE ALLOWANCES FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND THOSE ARE CONSIGNED BACK IN THAT REVENUES PLACE THE P. YOU SEE TO DELIVER REPAIR BENEFITS OF THE ELECTRIC SIDE HAS SOME THAT'S CARVED OUT THAT. SOME WHICH FUNDS MISS SEGMENTS PROGRAMMING LOW INCOME SOLAR AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A GASP RIGHT NOW IF WE LEAVE IT ON TOUCH TO GOES RIGHT BACK TO RATEPAYERS. JUST ONE BIG CHUNK BUT NOT. THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT WAS BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IN THE BUILDING SECTOR IS A MIX OF INNOVATIVE GAS TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIVE ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY RIGHT AN ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP NEW WAYS TO INTEGRATE ARE IN G. THE BILL WAS. DESIGNED TO BE TECHNO TRY APPRECIATE FOLKS WANT TO SEE LESS GAS IN THE SYSTEM BUT IT ACTUALLY WASN'T HERE TO EXCLUDE GAS. THAT'S WHY WE ORIGINALLY HAD IT WITH ELECTRIC AND GAS A BUT I'M I'M I'M DEFERRING TIP TO THE COMMITTEE ON THAT FRONT IN TERMS OF HOW TO CONSTRAIN THIS BUT I I WOULD. I AM OPEN. TO A ADDING THAT SAVINGS BECAUSE THE STATE THIS WON'T TRIGGER ANY NEW PUBLIC PURPOSE CHARGES. AND BE. ARE THERE OTHER POTS S. CHIP WAS MENTIONED I KNOW THE COMMITTEE MOVE SOMETHING ALONG ON THAT FRONT -- THERE'S EPIC FUNDS IN SOME C. E. C. PROGRAMS THERE'S ACTUALLY LEFT OVER DOLLARS IN THE NEW SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM SO I'M OPEN TO THOSE FUNDING SOURCES I DON'T WANT TO PUT. THIS WHOLE BURDEN NECESSARILY ON GAS CUSTOMERS BUT YEAH THAT'S THAT'S MY COMMENT ON INTO THEIR MEN'S WOULD WOULD WOULD STAY WITHIN JUST THAT GASOLINE BUT I'M I'M UP. SO IS THIS SPENDING. SOME OF THAT CLIMATE CREDIT OR IS THIS A NEW CHARGE ON RATE PAYERS TO BE ABLE TO US THAT THAT'S THE PART I'M. NOT IN CHARGE OF WITHIN THE CRIME OCCURRED. WITHIN YEAH SO SO TO BE CLEAR THAT IT IT WOULD. BE I GUESS IT'S A 5% I MEAN IT'S A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR CAP SO WE ORIGINALLY CARD THAT IT 5% BUT THAT MEANS 95% THEN IT GOES BACK TO THE CLIMATE CREDIT AND ENDS UP AS A STRAIGHT DIVIDEND ON YOUR BILL ALTHOUGH TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND MAY MISS SURE. YOU COULD CORRECT ME IF I'M NOT WRITER MY WITNESS BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THAT HAS YET COME BACK TO CUSTOMERS. I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN SO THAT IT'S A REDUCTION IN WHAT THEIR THEIR CREDIT IS GOING TO BE ON THEIR BILL. YES IT I MEAN SOURCE SPENDING IT FOR THEM IN ESSENCE WORK THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN I THINK AND I THINK HE YOU'VE GOTTA GET COMFORTABLE WITH. THE FACT THAT. SO WITH THE WAY THE ELECTRIC SIDE WORKS IS I THINK IT'S 15% FOR RATE PAYER BENEFIT. AND WE'RE SAYING YES THE PC PROGRAMS WE THINK CAN DO A LOT MORE TO ADVANCE THAT REPAIR BENEFIT KNOWING STACK UP THE REMAINING EIGHTY FIVE BUT THAT IS A PUBLIC POLICY CHOICE YOU GOTTA MAKE LIKE. WOULD IT WE JUST BE BETTER OFF GIVEN ALL THESE DOLLARS BACK. I I JUST I THINK ESPECIALLY FOR HOMEOWNERS. WE'VE GOT HELP THEM GET ALONG BECAUSE THAT INITIAL CAPITAL COSTS OF GETTING THAT ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP HIM AT THAT DECISION THAT'S GONNA SAVE YOU MONEY IN THE LONG TERM. IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S I MEAN I PRISON THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM COULD DO IT. BUT MIDDLE CLASS HOMEOWNERS -- THEY'RE NOT DO IT AND THOSE THE PEOPLE OR LOOK AT THIS CHAIR OF I CAN JUST TO ADD A COMMENT THEN YOU BACK ON YOUR THAT. BEGINNING THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CAP AND TRADE ON THE ASSEMBLY REPUBLICANS OF THE TIME PUT OUR PRINCIPLES TOGETHER AND OF THOSE PRINCIPLES -- BY ALMOST EVERYTHING BACK WE GOT EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THING AND THE ONE THING IS WE WERE TO TAKE THE ENTIRETY. OF OF THE THAT THE AUCTION REVENUES -- TO CONSUMERS AND THE ONE THING WE SORT OF HUNGER HAD AT LEAST IS A LITTLE BIT -- THAT WE'RE GIVING BACK TO CONSUMERS IT SEEMS LIKE NOW WE'RE DECIDING THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE DECISION ON HOW THAT MONIES SPENT AND SAID ABOUT MONEY. GOING BACK CONSUMER SO I LIKE THE PROGRAM -- I CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY BECAUSE IT OF THAT I GET IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY THAT FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST SAY CENTER I APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING WITH US ON THIS END UP TO THIS POINT IT HAS BEEN. CERTAINLY VERY THE COMMITTEE'S POSITION THAT -- RECOGNIZING ON ELECTRIC SIDE THERE WAS WITH DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT AND SO. WE DIDN'T WANT. TO OVER COMMIT OR CERTAINLY COMMIT IN AN AREA WHERE THERE WOULD BE PRESSURE POINTS AND THEN POTENTIALLY HAVE IMPACT ON REPAIRS SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHERE THERE WAS RESOURCES THAT WE COULD DRAW UPON THEM EFFECTIVELY. AND YES THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS OUT THERE BUT THEN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS THAT. ARE ABSOLUTE TARGETED TO THOSE THEIR DOLLARS AS WELL YEAH -- BUT WE DO -- APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH US AND THE DESIRE TO SEE THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD AND THE GOOD WORK AGAIN THAT YOU'RE DOING AND WILL WRECK PROCEDURE CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK ARRIVAL -- THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. THIS OVERALL HOLDEN PIKE HOLDEN AYE PATTERSON. PATTERSON NO FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN AYE BURKE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOUR STAFF FOR THE EXCELLENT COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THAT I THINK CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF WHY WE'RE HERE WITH THIS LEGISLATION -- I'M JOINED AS YOU KNOW BY YOUR MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM THERE'S A CO AUTHOR WITH ME AND OFFER A BRIEF OPENING STATEMENT AND HE FOLLOWED BY HIM AND THEN WITH PERMISSION XANDER WITNESSES -- MEMBERS ON JANUARY ELEVENTH OF THIS YEAR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION APPROVED P. JANIE'S REQUEST TO RETIRE DIABLO CANYON BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I TOWARD DISAPPOINTMENT THEY DID NOT APPROVE THE COMMUNITY IMPACT MITIGATION PROGRAM POOR FULLY FUND THE EMPLOYEE RETENTION PROGRAM THAT ARE VITAL COMPONENTS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PLANTS RETIREMENT. IN THE CONTINUED PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE REGION. BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL PROVIDE A BRIDGE TO OUR REGION AS THE TRANSITION. A CLOSURE OF THE APPLE CANYON MOVES FORWARD. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW. THE DECISION TO CLOSE THE PLAN HAS BEEN MADE THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT THAT DECISION. S. B. TEN NINETY AUTHORIZES THE P. YOU SEE TO APPROVE ELEMENTS OF THE JOINT PROPOSAL. THAT WAS SUBMITTED AS PART OF THE RETIREMENT APPLICATION INCLUDING EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COMMUNITY IMPACT MITIGATION PROGRAM REQUIRES FULL FUNDING IN THE EMPLOYEE RETENTION PROGRAM. AND DIRECTS THE PC TO MANAGE ITS INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO INCREASE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS A RESULT OF THE RETIREMENT OF THE PLANT. COMMUNITY HAS ASSUMED THE PUBLIC RISK FOR THE PAST THIRTY THREE YEARS WHILE ALL P. JEANNINE CUSTOMERS HAVE REALIZED THE BENEFITS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES AND WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE ENERGY. OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS -- UNTIL FINAL DECOMMISSIONING. ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY RISK IF I COULD JUST HOLD THIS UP AND SHOW MEMBERS. EVERY YEAR P. JEANNIE HANDS OUT THIS CALENDAR TO ALL THE RESIDENTS OF SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY NORTHERN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY [inaudible] THE BACK. FAMILY EVACUATION PLAN EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN THE REGION HAS TO HAVE AN EVACUATION PLAN LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY RUN ROUTINE. EVACUATION DRILLS FIRE POLICE HIGHWAY PATROL NATIONAL GUARD. THERE'S ALSO AN INSERT. THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MAIL IN. FOUR YEAR ALLOCATION. IT'S HASSIUM IODIDE. MOST FAMILIES IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY SINCE FUKUSHIMA NOW STOCK POTASSIUM IODIDE IN THEIR MEDICINE CABINETS IN THE EVENT OF A LEAK. SINCE THE COMMISSIONING OF DIABLO CANYON ABOUT ALL THE SPENT RODS ARE KEPT ON SITE IN CASKETS. AND WILL POSE AN ONGOING SECURITY RESPONSIBILITY. P. GENIE IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND WHILE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS ASSUME THESE RISKS. ALL PEACHY ANY CUSTOMERS HAVE RECEIVED THE OUTPUT FROM DIABLO AND WILL CONTINUE TO OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. SO MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT LABOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY LOCAL GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS IMPEACHING HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME NEGOTIATING THE JOINT PROPOSAL. I PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMAN JORDAN CUNNINGHAM WILL NOW VOICE HIS SUPPORT AND SHARE A FEW COMMENTS WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND THEN LAST THE CHAIR FOR PERMISSION TO PRESENT OUR WITNESSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE I'D ECHO EVERYTHING THE SENATOR SAID. AND I WANT TO COME A MOMENT TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON THAT THE WORK FORCE AND THE WORKERS THE DIABLO CANYON. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THEM TO NOT JUST OUR COMMUNITY BUT TO TO OUR STATE AS A WHOLE. THIS IS. A FACILITY THAT OPERATES WITH THE STRICTEST POSSIBLE SECURITY YOU CAN IMAGINE I'VE TOURED IT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK. TO EVEN ENTER THE FACILITY. THE WORKERS THAT WORK THERE. WORK THAT YOU CANNOT FIND A MORE SKILLED. HIGHLY TRAINED COMPETENT. S. THEY WORK. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE THEY KEEP THIS FACILITY RUNNING. SAFELY AND SECURELY THE SECURITY FORCE. IT'S MILITARY GRADE SECURITY THAT PROTECTS IT. FROM ANY KIND OF ATTACK OR ANYBODY THAT WOULD ENGAGE IN FOUL PLAY. THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FLAWLESSLY FOR DECADES. THEY'RE ALSO THE FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF SOME SORT INCIDENT. SOME SORT OF WEEK SOME SORT OF EVENT ATTACK WHAT HAVE YOU. THEY'RE THE FIRST PEOPLE THERE. DEAD PEOPLE BEAR THAT RISK EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY'RE NOT PLAN. AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT TO THE STATE CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED THIS ONE FACILITY IS 10% OF OUR STATE'S ELECTRICITY. 10% CARBON FREE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR. AND IF I COULD SAY WHAT I THINK HAPPENED TO THOSE WORKERS. BEING PROMISED A CERTAIN THING. AND HAVING THAT REDUCED WAS UNFAIR. I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO BE TOLD IF YOU STATE YOU'RE GONNA GET BONUS ACTS. SO THAT YOU COMMIT TO STAYING TO KEEP THIS FACILITY RUNNING. YOU CAN'T RUN NUCLEAR FACILITY PERHAPS. THERE'S NO WAY. AND YOU CAN GET WORKERS FROM OUT OF STATE TO MOVE SOMEWHERE THAT'S GONNA CLOSE. THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DO. AND THEY WERE PROMISED ACTS AND THEY GOT REDUCED I THINK THAT WAS UNFAIR I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT RIGHT IT'S GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE STATE BECAUSE WE NEED THE FOR THIS FACILITY. TO OPERATE THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE NEED IT FOR THE ENERGY WE NEED FOR THE ENVIRONMENT NEED FOR WORKFORCE. WE NEED THE THE POWER. AT THIS POINT PROVIDES FOR SEVEN YEARS GIVES US A CHANCE A RUNWAY AN OPPORTUNITY. FIGURE OUT HOW TO REPLACE. 10% OF CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY. WITH CARBON FREE [inaudible] GENERATION. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO HOW DO THAT TODAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT I I WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE A SECURE AND RELIABLE WORKFORCE [inaudible] PAT DIABLO. ON SITE AT THE POST. INTEL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE'VE GOT BIG PROBLEMS. SO ON BEHALF OF THE WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITY I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND PLEASE SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU AND SOME A MEMBER CUNNINGHAM AND SIR MONEY WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA AND YOU'RE A COMMUNITIES WILL REPRESENT -- YOUR WITNESS MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MEMBER SCOTT WHICH OF IF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES I HAVE WITH ME A WITNESS. TO TALK OF SPECIFICALLY TO SOME OF THE ISSUES I HAVE STATEMENT I WAS GOING TO SAY. AND I CAN'T ADD A SINGLE THING TO WHAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER CUTTING HIM JUST SAID INSTALLED FOR MY COMMENTS. OF A SIMILAR CUNNINGHAM WILL HAVE TO BRING YOU BACK MORE OFTEN. TO I PRAISE HIM. ABOUT DAVE IV EVERY TWELVE FORTY FIVE AND I ECHO THE COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. FROM THE ASSEMBLYMAN. SO THE WORKERS THAT DABBLE CANYON. REPRESENTED BY. TWELVE FORTY FIVE ARE RUNNING THE MOST SAFE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN THE NATION. NAY DO THAT BY MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TIME AND EFFORT SPENT ON TRAINING THE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT BE REPLACED WITH THE TEMPORARY WORKFORCE. THERE PROMISED THAT IF THE STATE THOSE WHO WOULD RETIRE NOW. TO FURTHER RETIREMENT TO KEEP THE PLANT THE PLANT RUNNING THOSE WHO ARE YOUNG WOULD NOT LEAVE BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE THAT WE NEGOTIATED WITH PGE. THERE WAS STATE RETAIN THE BONUS SO WE WOULD LOOK FOR THEM JOBS. IN THE FUTURE. THE STRUCTURE OF THIS IN THE PROMISE OF THIS WE BELIEVE. IT WAS DONE IN GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATION OF PIGEON ANY TOM DOES ALL OF MYSELF. THEY WOULD KEEP THE PLANT RUNNING AT THE SAME QUALITY THAT IS RUNNING TODAY THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE KEEP THAT JEANETTE GHG FREE ENERGY THAT SAFETY THAT LEVEL OF SAFETY FOR THAT COMMUNITY. THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS. DEFINITELY UNFAIR PRICE STRONGER THAN UNFAIR TO REDUCE THAT -- WHEN WAS BARGAINING GOOD FAITH? WE HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE TO KEEP PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA RETIRE THERE WE HAVE A PLAN TO KEEP YOUNGER WORKERS WHO ARE ALSO VITAL BOTH TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO DIE WE CAN. KEEP THEM THERE ALL AT THE PLAN AND TO THEN RETAIN THEM GOING FORWARD. WE SPELL LOT OF TIME WITH BOTH OF THESE GROUPS IN ADVANCE OF THIS NEGOTIATION. TO FIND OUT WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE TO KEEP YOU HERE WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE YOU TO RUN OTHER NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS ARE OFFERING HUGE BONUSES FOR YOU TO COME THERE. WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE YOU FROM LEAVING THE INDUSTRY OR TO GO OTHER PLACES THESE ARE HIGHLY QUALIFIED WORKERS. WHO HAVE OTHER PLACES THEY CAN EASILY GO INSIDE THE INDUSTRY? THE PROBLEM IS THAT PLANT CANNOT RUN WITH THE WITHOUT THESE VITAL PEOPLE DOING VERY SPECIFIC TASKS. THAT THEY THAT THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED SOMETIMES FOR HALF A DECADE TO BECOME JOURNEYMAN. TO RUN THAT PLAN SO IT IS VITAL AYE THE FOR THAT. PLAN AND FOR THE STATE TO KEEP THOSE PEOPLE THERE IN THE PROMISES THAT THEY WERE MADE. AND ACTUALLY AND I THINK WITH THAT AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS IN THE LOCAL. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN PER SHAUN ON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. A SENATE BILL TEN NINETY HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED AS A THREE LEGGED STOOL TO MAINTAIN THE SAFE AND SECURE OPERATION OF THE PLANT. THROUGH TO ITS RETIREMENT. THE BRIDGE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE COMMUNITY IMPACT MITIGATION PROGRAM. IS AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS THE TWO OTHER LEGS. P. JEANNIE AND I DON'T STE IN JUNE OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT IT WOULD NOT SEEK TO RENEW THE FEDERAL LICENSE OF DIABLO CANYON UNITS ONE AND TWO WHEN THOSE LICENSES EXPIRE 242-024-2020. FIVE ALTHOUGH PGP JEANNIE HAS NEGOTIATED CLOSURE TERMS TO SOME OF THE PARTIES AND HAVE INCLUDED COMMUNITY MITIGATION FUNDING THE FORTY NINE MILLION IN THAT SETTLEMENT -- IT SOON BECAME CLEAR THAT THE FORTY NINE MILLION WASN'T AN ADEQUATE NUMBER TO MAINTAIN SERVICES DURING THE NINE YOUR CLOSURE PERIOD. SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY SAN LUIS OBISPO A COASTAL UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE SEVEN CITIES BEGAN MEETING WITH P. GENIE IN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. TO TRY AND DETERMINE. THE TRUE EFFECT OF THE DECISION TO SET THE PLANT RETIREMENT DATE IN THE END WE ARRIVE AT A FIGURE OF EIGHTY FIVE MILLION TO BE COLLECTED AS PART OF THE RATES OVER A NINE YEAR PERIOD. THE COMMUNITY IMPACT MITIGATION FUND HAS TWO COMPONENTS THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES MITIGATION FUND WILL CONSIST OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND A DOES IT IS DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN ESSENTIAL SERVICES AT CURRENT LEVELS. THE SERVICES TO BE FUNDED INCLUDE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROGRAMS FIRE DISTRICTS WATER AND FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S. INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND SCHOOL STAFF. THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS DOLLARS IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SEED FUNDING FOR EARLY IN TARGETED LOCAL ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT BY THE COUNTY FOURTH SEVEN CITIES. AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE PLANTS HOST COMMUNITY BEGIN RESTRUCTURING ITS ECONOMY BEFORE THE PLANT IS CLOSE. TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE COMMUNITY IMPACT MITIGATION FUND IS BRIDGE FUNDING TO ALLOW SAFE PLANT OPERATION BY EXPERIENCED AND YOU AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY VERY EXPERIENCE DIABLO EMPLOYEES UNTIL PLANNED RETIREMENT. EMPLOYEE RETENTION IS ESSENTIAL FOR DIABLO CANYON BECAUSE EACH NUCLEAR POWER PLANT HAS UNIQUE OPERATING [inaudible] REQUIREMENTS OUR PLAN ALLOWS THE EXISTING EXPERIENCED WORKFORCE SHOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID LEAVING FOR BETTER JOBS OF PLANTS THAT ARE NOT PLAYING TO CLOSE. THESE EMPLOYEES WILL BE ASSISTED WITH THE EMPLOYEE RETENTION COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL BUT THEY NEED TO BE ASSURED. THAT THE COMMUNITY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEIR FAMILIES WITH DECENT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND NECESSARY PUBLIC SAFETY. THE RATE PAYERS WILL SEE A SMALL INCREASE IN THEIR ENERGY BILLS A FEW CENTS PER MONTH BUT THE PROGRAM DOES NOT GO INTO PERPETUITY. THE RATE INCREASE WILL BE IN EFFECT FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS THIS ISN'T EQUITABLE BRIDGE FUNDING SUPPORT PROVISION FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS SUPPORTED THE PLANT THROUGH ITS ENTIRE OPERATING LIFE. AND WILL SUPPORT THE SPENT FUEL% FACILITY OF THE PLANT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU -- BUT WILL ENTERTAIN THE NEXT SPEAKERS A NAME AN ORGANIZATION CALLED MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TELLING THE HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE ST LOUIS COASTAL UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THANK YOU TO OUR CHAMPIONS [inaudible] SECURE SUPPORT. SURE MEMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN STRONG SUPPORT THINK. A MARIN AMBIANCE HERE COULD CALIFORNIANS WORK. CHAU BECKER LINESMAN NUCLEAR RESPONSIBILITY WHO IS BASED IN SANTA CPAS BUT THE FALL OUTS ARE. AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S ANDREA BALL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. SALAS LIKE ON BEHALF P. JIMMY AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. RICHARD ONLY HALF THE CITY OF PERSONAL BEACH IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PLUG INS OFFICE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF ATASCADERO AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. BUT YOU ARE IS THERE ANYONE HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MATT FRIEDMAN REPRESENTING THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK WE WERE AN ACTIVE PARTY IN THE PRECEDING CONSIDERING P. GENIES PROPOSAL. TO CLOSE DIABLO CANYON AT THE END OF ITS CURRENT LICENSE. AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT S. B. TEN NINETY WHICH WOULD FORCE THE PEA YOU SEE TO REYES PGD CUSTOMER RATES BY. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO COLLECT FUNDS FOR ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEERETENTION PAYMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IN THE RECENT PROCEEDING CONSIDERING P. GENIES APPLICATION THE P. DID AUTHORIZE TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR EMPLOYEE RETENTION PAYMENTS OUT OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION THAT WAS REQUESTED BY P. GENIE. AND AFTER CONSIDERING THE EVIDENCE THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT QUOTE P. GENIUS PROPOSAL APPEARS TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FREE RIDER PROBLEM THAT P. JEANNIE DOES NOT ADDRESS AND AS SUCH. PROPOSAL IS OVERLY GENEROUS WITH REPAIR FUNDING. ON THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY DOESN'T ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND WOULD REQUIRE A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW RATE INCREASES WITHOUT ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER. THE REASONABLENESS OF THESE PAYMENTS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO FORCE THE PC TO INCREASE PEKINGESE CUSTOMER RATES BY EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A SERIES OF NEW CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN P. JEANNIE AND THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE SIXTY FIVE MILLION FOR LOCAL CITIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SETTLEMENT. AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT FUND THAT ALSO LACKS ANY SPECIFICITY. I'M TURN DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT REPAIRS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT PAYMENTS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES EVERY TIME A MAJOR UTILITY ASSET IS REMOVED FROM SERVICE. SINCE THE PLANT WAS FIRST COMMISSION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT DIABLO CANYON WAS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE AT THE END OF ITS CURRENT LICENSE. THE RECENT PEW SEE DECISION ONLY REINFORCES THIS PRE EXISTING EXPECTATION. OUR CONCERN IS THAT S. B. TEN NINETY WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO EVERY OTHER COMMUNITY AFFECTED BY A PLANT CLOSURE TO SEEKS SIMILAR SUPPORT PAYMENTS. THAT WOULD BE FINANCED THROUGH RATE INCREASES ON ALL CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE OFFERED TO ALTERNATIVES THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. ABOUT ONE WE WOULD PROPOSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER AUTHORIZING MONEY FROM THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY PAYMENTS IF IT IS INDEED A STATEWIDE OBLIGATION IT'S WE PAID BY ALL THE TAXPAYERS [inaudible] SECOND THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONDITION ANY RATE PAIR FUNDING ON EQUIVALENT CONTRIBUTION FOR P. GENIES OWN SHAREHOLDERS THAT HAVE REALIZE SUBSTANTIAL PROFITS FROM THE OWNERSHIP OF THE FACILITY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. SO WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE RETIREMENT OF THIS PLANT WILL HAVE IMPACTS IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. THE LEGISLATURE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE LOCAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF DIABLO CANYON WILL NOT END WHEN THE FACILITY SHUTS DOWN IN. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AT THAT POINT B. GENIE WILL BEGIN A DECADES LONG EFFORT TO DECOMMISSION THE PLANT AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF OVER TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING. A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE BENEFITS WE BELIEVE THAT THAT PROJECT IS GOING TO REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT LOCAL WORKFORCE AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE JOBS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TO THE REGION. FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND FOR THAT REASON WE EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I'M MY NAME IS SET DOCTOR JEAN NELSON FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO IVA PITCHING RADIATION BIOPHYSICS AND I'M SPEAKING FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR GREEN NUCLEAR POWER. INCORRECTLY LISTED AS A SUPPORTER IN THE ANALYSIS AS OUR NAME SUGGEST CGMP IS A NONPROFIT COMPOSED OF CALIFORNIANS WHO APPRECIATE THE ADVANTAGES OF NUCLEAR POWER PROVIDED FOR RATEPAYERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT CGMP INCLUDE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. WHO ARE SPECIALISTS IN THEIR FIELD EACH WITH DECADES OF EXPERIENCE CGMP TIMELY FILED A CPUC APPLICATION FOR REHEARING A PEACHY MEANS CONTROVERSIAL APPLICATION TO ABANDON DIABLO CANYON FOR THAT REASON THE CPUC WEBSITE? NOW SHOWS THAT THE P. GENIE APPLICATION IS RE OPENED. ANTICIPATE PREVAILING ON THE MERITS OF OUR CASE OUR LEAD ATTORNEY IS UP OF FORMER ASSEMBLYMAN MIKE GADO. OUT WERE NEW LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT WE STEPPED FORWARD TO HELP POLICY MAKERS MAKE WISE DECISIONS BASED ON SCIENCE AND FACT NOT FEAR MONGERING. OUR DECISIONS THAT OUR DESCENDANTS WILL RESPECT WE MUST OPPOSE SB TEN NINETY UNLESS AMENDED FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. ON APRIL ELEVENTH HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SENATE EQ SEE CONSULTANT DOCTOR DAVID GARCIA AND HE AGREED BASED ON MY ANALYSIS THAT REPLACING TABLE CAN WITH OTHER CARBON FREE ENERGY. WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. SO I'M GONNA KIND OF SKIPPED GROUP BECAUSE WE HAVE TAPPED HAVE A LITTLE LESS TIME MARTY COULD YOU TAKE OVER -- S. B. S. SO I'M I'M DOCTOR MICHAEL MERRIMACK VOLUNTEERING MY TIME ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE NUCLEAR POWER AND I'M NOT REPRESENTING MY EMPLOYER. S. B. TEN NINETY CONTAINS AN OPERATIVE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS WHICH HAVE NO EFFECT IS LA. THE LANGUAGE IN THOSE FINDINGS IF IS A FIG LEAF FOR THE WEEKEND VERY MENTAL LANGUAGE IN THE BILL'S ONLY OPERATIVE SECTION THAT'S ACT LANGUAGE IN SECTION. TWO ONLY MANDATES THAT THE CPUC PLANS REQUIRES PLANS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO AVOID INCREASED EMISSIONS. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYONE TO SHOW THE DIABOLO WILL BE REPLACED WITH CLEAN POWER. AND POSSIBLE COMPANIES STORAGE NUCLEAR POWER IS ALREADY SAFE CLEAN STORAGE EMPOWER. AND CAL OR AYE AYE SOONER CITIZENS DEPEND UPON THESE FACTS NOT ILLUSORY PLANS. SP TEN NINETY FORCES RATE PAYERS TO FOOT THE BILLS FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES BUSINESS DECISIONS. WHAT REASON WILL YOU GIVE YOUR CONSTITUENTS FOR VOTING FOR THIS GIVEAWAY PREPARE SHOULD NOT PUT THE BILL FOR P. JEANNIE'S DECISION TO ABANDON A RESOURCE WITH AN EXEMPLARY SAFETY RECORD? AND DECADES OF REMINDING EVER MADE IN LIFE. THE CLOSURE OF DABBLE CAN IT IS NOT SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ENDORSE. GIVENCALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE THE WISDOM OF ABANDONING CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST CARBON FREE ENERGY SOURCE CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGED. BY ENGINEERS CLIMATOLOGIST ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND LOCAL RESIDENTS THEIR BOOK CANON PRODUCES ONE TENTH OF CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL ANNUAL ELECTRICITY NEEDS ECONOMICALLY. AND GREENHOUSE GAS FREE. NOTED CLIMATE SCIENTIST DR JAMES HANSEN IS PUBLISHED ESTIMATE THAT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED. BY THE REDUCTION IN AIR POLLUTION ACHIEVED BY NUCLEAR PLANTS WORLDWIDE. SP TEN NINETY WILL JUST RESULT IN SHUFFLING EXISTING GREENHOUSE GAS RESOURCES AND IMPROPER RELIANCE UPON CCA'S. UNLIKE SOLAR AND WIND PREAMBLE CANYON IS A RELIABLE SUPPLY OF ESSENTIAL BASELOAD POWER. TAKING GAVEL OFFLINE WOULD RESULT IN BURNING MORE FOSSIL FUELS TO MEET THAT NEED THIS WOULD RESULT IN SEVEN MILLION TIMES MORE CO TWO EMISSIONS ANNUALLY. AND HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK CONTINUED OPERATING THAT'S ONE HUNDRED MILLION TONS OVER THE TWENTY YEAR RELICENSING PERIOD. PJ ANY TESTIFIED THAT MUCH OF THE REPLACEMENT POWER FOR DIABLO CANYON WOULD BE GENERATED BY UNREGULATED COMMUNITY CHURCH AGGREGATORS. BUT THERE IS NO WAY FOR CPUC TO ENFORCE THAT THEY WOULD NEED THE ENORMOUS CHALLENGE. GAS AND SINCE THE SERIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO AUDIT THEIR SOURCES THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO VERIFY ANY CLAIM REGARDING THE KIND YOU CAN YOU BRING YOUR COMMENTS SO I WE HAVE IN STOCK EVERY AMENDMENTS. WEEK IF WE COULD THAT YOU SHOULD A SAID THAT AT THE EARLY PART TEN SECONDS. SO IT PAGE ANY TRULY BELIEVES THAT HAVE A CAN AND TO BE RELEASED WITH REPLACEMENT PRE LAST POWER PRE POWER. THEY SHOULD HAVE NO REQUIRE LOW ISSUE WITH LEGISLATIVE WRITTEN LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES KEEP YOU SEE TO DETERMINE THIS CAN BE DONE CONCLUSIVELY. BEFORE PROVING THAT THE PLANT CLOSED [inaudible] HERE TO HAVE A COMMENT IN OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL SAY NINE WILL BRING IT BACK TO DIE ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS FROM. MISTER MASON DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU KNOW YOU GO [inaudible] GREAT JOB -- BY YOU GUYS ARE TO BE APPLAUDED FOR THIS WORK -- THIS IS -- WHAT GOVERNING IS ALL ABOUT -- ON A PERSONAL NOTE I'VE ACTUALLY VISITED AT THAT FACILITY I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC FACILITY I WAS INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I HEARD. THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE SHUT DOWN I WISH THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE SHUT DOWN BUT THAT'S NOT A DECISION. THAT WE'RE MAKING HERE TODAY THAT DECISION HAS ALREADY. BEEN MADE OF IF WE COULD KEEP IT OPEN WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT OPEN UP THAT DECISIONS ALREADY. HAVE BEEN MADE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER WAY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS SOMBER TALK ABOUT A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AND YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GOT WORKERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THERE. THIS IS THE BEST WAY BY THING TO DO THAT DUH COULD JUST YOU GUYS FOR FOR YOUR HARD WORK WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. DUCT WORK. THAT THAT DECISION TO SHUT DOWN THE NUCLEAR PLANT WAS A BUSINESS DECISION ON THE PART OF PGA NEED THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY DIFFICULT RENEWAL. IN ADDITION THEY DON'T REALLY NEED POWER BECAUSE THE CCA'S HAVE TAKEN OVER SO MUCH SO I DO AGREE WITH THE COMMENT FROM ONE OF THE EXPERTS THAT. IN FACT IT'LL BE THE CCA CIVIL BE LOOKING FOR REPLACEMENT POWER AND THAT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE. ARE OF WHAT TYPE OF ENERGY THAT WILL COME OUT WITH HOWEVER -- KNOWING ALL THE CCA'S THERE GONNA TRY AND AND AND MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DAY YEAH -- THEY ARE REQUIRED TO BALANCE THEIR LOAD SO THEY WILL ALSO BE DOING THAT SO I THINK THERE IS A UNANSWERED WHAT WILL HAPPEN -- IN EFFECT IT MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY REPLACEMENT BY RENEWABLES BUT OF THE CCA SWELL. THAT'LL BE ACTUALLY THE ONES TRYING TO PROCURE THE NEW POWER. AS THAT PLANT GOES DOWN OUT WILL A LARGE MAN [inaudible] RENEWABLES THANK YOU IT'S MERCER'S. CEREMONY GOT PROCEED -- TO YOU ARE REACHING OUT TO ME TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS I JUST WANTED -- TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE. MAYBE ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE AND AND AND YOU MENTIONED THAT ON THE WHITE NOT THE SHAREHOLDERS Y. THE RATEPAYERS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING. THE TIME TO MEET WITH ME EARLIER. SO SIMPLY STATED -- I THINK I'LL. A NUMBER OF US IF WE HAD THE OPTION OF ASKING SHAREHOLDERS TO PAY FOR THIS THAT MIGHT BE A MORE ATTRACTIVE OPTION. FACT OF THE MATTER IS ALL COURT PRECEDENT. SHAREHOLDERS NEVER GET ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE TO A SOLUTION IF YOU DON'T HAVE PROOF OF NEGLIGENCE MALFEASANCE MISMANAGEMENT. THAT'S NOT THE CASE IT'S A BUSINESS DECISION TO CLOSE THE FACILITY WITH THE LOCAL IMPACTS HAS DISCUSSED. BUT IT DOES THEN RAISED THE QUESTION THAT WE DISCUSSED IS THAT APPROPRIATE FOR RATEPAYERS. TO BE ASKED SHOULDER THE COST OF OF THE DECOMMISSIONING AND SUPPORT THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT'S BEEN REACHED UP BY THE PARTIES. AND A WHILE I RESPECT THE WORK THAT TURNED US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIAN THEIR ADVOCACY FOR RATEPAYERS. THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION THIS IS THE LAST OPERATING NUCLEAR FACILITY IN THE STATE. UNLIKE SANTA NO FREE THAT WAS ON A MILITARY INSTALLATION AND AND AMOUNTED TO A MUCH SMALLER PART OF THE ECONOMY OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE EMPLOYER IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. PEOPLE OF SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY NORTHERN SANTA BARBARA HAVE SHOULDERED THE RISK AND EVERY P. JEANNIE RATE PAIR. HAS BEEN THE BENEFICIARY OF THE ENERGY PRODUCED AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE. FOR A FINITE PERIOD OF TIME OVER THERE EIGHT YEARS WITH AN AVERAGE FAMILY INCREASE OF TWENTY THREE CENTS PER MONTH IT'S A DE MINIMUS BE SHARED BY ALL BENEFICIARIES OF P. GENIE -- ENERGY PRODUCTION IT WILL HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT OF MINIMIZING CREATING A GLIDE PATH FOR THE RECONVERSION OF THE ECONOMY IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. AND PRIMARILY IN FOREMOST BY RETAINING SKILLED WORKERS PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY NOT JUST TO THAT REGION. BUT REALLY THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THANK. THANK YOU CENTER MY NAME AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM THIS IS -- CLEARLY A VERY IMPORTANT BILL TO THE PEOPLE OF SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY AND OF BRING STABILITY TO THE AREA. TO THE JOBS AND EMPLOYMENT IN THAT IN THAT AREA AROUND DIABLO. FOR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE SO WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE THEIR GOOD WORK AND THERE NO OTHER. COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. I WILL TURN TWO ONE OF YOU WERE BOTH OF YOU FOR CLOTHES YEAH HA STARTIN IN MY COLLEAGUE MAIN ALSO I SHARE SOME COMMENTS VERY BRIEFLY I PREACH I THINK WE'VE HAD A COMPREHENSIVE. CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ISSUES -- I WOULD SUBMIT THAT WHILE. WE BRING THIS SOME FOR THE PROTECTION IMMEDIATELY OF THE PEOPLE OF SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. IT'S REALLY TO PROTECT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND A FINAL COMMENT ON THE REPLACEMENT ENERGY. WELL WE UNDERSTAND NUCLEAR ENERGY TO BE CLEAN ENERGY IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACTS. IT'S NOT CLEAN IN TERMS OF THE WASTE THAT'S LEFT BEHIND AND THAT'S PART OF THE HIGH COST OF CONTINUING TO OPERATE A NUCLEAR. PLANT IT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR RELICENSING WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE SPENT RODS THIS CAN MEAN ONGOING SECURITY OBLIGATION IN COST WHAT THIS BILL LOOKS AT IS THE DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS. AND A FINITE PERIOD OF TIME OF A DE MINIMIS RATE INCREASE. AND WITH THE COMMITMENT OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND RTC ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND THE ALLIANCE -- FOR FOR NUCLEAR -- FOR NUCLEAR RESPONSE. ALL OF THEM. AS PARTIES TO THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE CONFIDENT THAT PGD PART OF THEIR BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT WHAT'S LOST ON THE GRID WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY CLEAN LESS EXPENSIVE. THAT'S WHERE NEW JOBS ARE IN THIS STATE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW JOBS SOLAR IS GETTING LESS EXPENSIVE WERE WORKING ON WIND ENERGY OFF THAT SAME COAST WE MAY EVEN BILL TO USE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THE FUTURE FOR WIND ENERGY SO THIS IS THE RIGHT REMEDY AND I'LL JUST CLOSE ON THIS WHEN IT WENT BEFORE THE P. YOU SEE. THEY WERE P. YOU SEE COMMISSIONERS WHO APPLAUDED. THE NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. AND EXPRESSED THEIR REGRET. THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY IN THEIR MIND TO APPROVE THE AGREED TO SETTLEMENT AND IT WOULD REQUIRE LEGISLATION. WE'RE HERE WITH THAT LEGISLATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I'D LIKE TO SEE IF MY COAUTHOR. I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER SOME COMMENTS I WOULD TO SAID FOR FINAL CONSIDERATION. I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED THAT THE NRC THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION DOES HAVE MINIMUM STAFFING STAFFING THRESHOLDS. BUT EVERY NUCLEAR FACILITY. AND IF YOU FALL BELOW THOSE THRESHOLDS ARE THAT THRESHOLD. IN TERMS OF YOUR CERTIFICATED WORKFORCE. AND THEY CAN CHECK IT OUT. SO WHILE THERE IS A COST THIS THAT'S UNDENIABLE. I IT'S AN INSURANCE POLICY OF SORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE THIS FACILITY SAFELY AND SECURELY. A THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CLOSER. TO AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY THE THE BILL. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED.

THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE WITH THE CHAIR VOTING AYE. GALLAGHER. EDUARDO GARCIA REYES A AYE REYES AYE SANTIAGO [inaudible] SANTIAGO AYE. S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN BUT THE CHAIR VOTING AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE EDUARDO GARCIA REYES. REYES AYE. SANTIAGO SANTIAGO AYE. YOU'RE ALREADY ON THE S. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WITH THE CHAIR VOTING AYE CHEN CHEN NO. THAT WATER GARCIA [inaudible] SANTIAGO [inaudible] CORRECT [inaudible] SANTIAGO AYE. PERFECT TIMING SENATOR. YOU THINK YOU. SO WE WILL. TURN OUR ATTENTION TO FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO S. B. [inaudible] TWO THIRTY SEVEN HERTZBERG THANK YOU. PHOTOS OF HER. THE ISSUE IS [inaudible] DIRECT ACCESS. CERTAINLY WE DEALT WITH THIS IN THE ENERGY CRISIS MANY YEARS AGO. BUT CENTER KEOGH IF MY RECOLLECTION SERVES ME CORRECTLY -- WITH GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER LIFTED A CAP [inaudible] AND WE'VE GOT THIS CHALLENGE. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH REGIONALIZATION OF THE GREATER RE THINKING. HOW WE DELIVER ENERGY? THE OLD BUSINESS MODEL THE DEAL THAT WAS MADE YEARS AGO WHEN SOCIETY BEGAN TO RELY MORE HEAVILY. ON ELECTRICITY. AND BECAUSE IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO THE FUNCTIONING OF SOCIETY WE BASICALLY SAID. WE'RE GONNA GRANT A MONOPOLY TO GOVERNMENT. AND WERE GONNA SAY OR DON'T BEASTIES UNIQUE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IF YOU ARE LOW INCOME GOVERNMENT WE KEEP THIS GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE WHERE EVERYBODY DECIDES. HOW MUCH THE COSTS ARE WE CAN HAVE RATE TERRACE IN WE'RE GONNA TERMINATE RATE SO WE CAN GUARANTEE INVESTORS ARE RATE OF RETURN? AND IT WORKED PRETTY INTELLIGENTLY FOR A LONG TIME. WE HAD AN EXPERIMENT WITH MISTER BOLTON MR PIECE IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR EIGHTEEN NINETY WAS THE ISSUE OF WE DEREGULATED BOTH THE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL MARKET. AT A TIME WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES WEREN'T AVAILABLE AND IT WAS EARLY. AND IT WE ALL KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ME IN PARTICULAR. AND NOW WHAT'S HAPPENED HAS BEEN WE HAVE AS WE GRAPPLE WITH SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES. WE'VE COME ALONG AND SAID WE WANT TO START. PUTTING IN RENEWABLES AND WE WANT TO CHANGE FOR SERIES OF REASONS. HOW WE RELY ON ENERGY? WILL THAT CHANGE HAS FUNDAMENTALLY. ARM IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN I WASN'T WORKING IN THE ENERGY CRISIS EVERY LAW THAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE WHOLE STATE WAS IN THE WRITTEN BY MUNICIPAL OR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN THEY HAD REALLY MONOPOLISTIC POWER JURISPRUDENTIAL IF YOU WILL. AND SOON WE STARTED SAYING WELL WE WANTED TO START HAVING A RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD WHATEVER YOU THAT WAS TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND THE U. S.. WITHOUT BYRON SHEER. ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THAT WAS WELL. IT DOESN'T PERFORM IN THE SAME MANNER AS OTHER ENERGY IT'S NOT THE EXACT SAME BASES LOADED WITH BASED LOADS IN PICKERS AND THE LIKE AND WE HAD ALL PRICING SCHEDULE. YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WE DID FLEXURE POWER PROGRAM IS ALL ABOUT. TRIP SHUT YOUR YOUR YOUR WASHING MACHINE OFTEN YOUR LIGHTS OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IN AUGUST NOW WE CAN THE MIDDLE THE DAY IN AUGUST SOMETIMES WE HAVE IT ALL A SURPLUS IN JUNE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE AYE IS SO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO WITH REGIONALIZATION. TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. WE HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE TO TAKE THE EXTRA POWER. SO PART OF THAT DIAGNOSTIC WHEN I FIRST CAME BACK TO GOVERNMENT HOW MANY YEARS OF FOUR YEARS AGO WHATEVER I DID A DIRECT ACCESS BILL. AND NOW I'M SITTING WITH THAT GUY KILLED JEFF DEXTER NO. BACK THEN I THINK IT WAS IN THIS COMMITTEE. ARM TRYING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER ON THE RETAIL SIDE FOR COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENTS CHOICE. WHY IS IT IN SUPPORT FOR A LOT OF REASONS AND WE THINK THAT THEN I'LL LET TURN OVER TO MISTER WELCH? BUT IT'S GOING TO GIVE THE LARGER CONTEXT OF WHAT I'M DOING OF LIFTING THAT CAP THAT WE HAD WAS SENATOR KEYHOE -- WHAT YEARS AT NINE TO THE? HE IS TWO THOUSAND NINE THERE'S TWO THOUSAND I AS IS ALWAYS AS WE SEE I CAN NEVER BILL NUMBERS ON AROUND GOLDMEMBER. BUT THE THE POINT IS IS THAT. ARM TO TRY TO CREATE THOSE RETAIL MARKETS IN A WAY THAT GIVES CHOICE BECAUSE OF A CUT BUSINESSES LOOK EVERY BUSINESS HAS THREATENED FIXED COSTS WHAT BUSINESS IS TRYING TO DO IS TO BE GREAT CREATIVE TO MANAGE THOSE FIXED COSTS. AND TRY TO PUT TOGETHER VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS AND BY LIFTING THIS CAP. THERE'S JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY MISTER WHICH CAN TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS BECAUSE OF EXTRAORDINARY BACKLOG OF COMPANIES THAT ARE PRETTY CREATIVE IN THAT WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO REDUCE COSTS. ONE I CHAIRED THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. IN 200-042-00011 WE DID SURVEYS ON BUSINESS CLIMATE AND EVERYBODY ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT REGULATION AND ALL THAT STUFF. PART NUMBER ONE OF OUR TOP THE TOP TWO ISSUES WHICH ENERGY COSTS ENERGY COSTS. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS. WILL WE CAN HARMONIZE PUBLIC POLICY TO REDUCE ENERGY COSTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE ONE HAND. YET GIVE SMART COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY REDUCE THEIR ENERGY COSTS IN WAYS THAT ARE MORAL AT A CONSISTENT WITH ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA GET DIRECT ACCESS THEY'RE GONNA BY DIFFERENT SOURCES. AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THIS BILL THAT LOST IN THIS COMMITTEE. FOUR YEARS AGO TO BRING IT BACK TODAY. BUT WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO TURN OVER TO MR WHICH GERMAN MEMBER SCOTT WHICH CAN BE HALF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. I THINK FOR FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN ENERGY POLICY -- SINCE -- THE EARLY NINETIES -- AND CERTAINLY SINCE A DEREGULATION THEY WILL BE SHOCKED SEE ME UP HERE SUPPORTING THE BILL TO LIFT THE CAP DIRECT ACCESS I'M THE FIRST ONE BY THE WAY. THE JUST. JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE BILL OVER -- MANY MANY MANY YEARS TO HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED WE WE HAVE A POST. AND SO SO WHAT HAS CHANGED WHAT WHAT WE'VE COME TO REALIZE IS THAT [inaudible] A AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK POINTED OUT WE'VE BALKANIZED THE ENERGY MARKETS IN. AND UNDER THE GUISE OF COMPETITION WE HOPE WE WE WE HAVE ALLOWED CERTAIN. TYPES OF OF OF WHAT I WOULD CALL FAKE COMPETITION TO OCCUR WE'VE ALLOWED -- CUTIE CHORES AGGREGATORS TO TO FORM INTO JUST SWEEP CUSTOMERS. AND THEN THE CUSTOMERS HAVE TO BE SAVVY ENOUGH -- TO OPT OUT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SERVED BY THAT INTO TV LONGER THAT'S NOT COMPETITION. SO WE'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF YOU GET A DO COMPETITION AND YOU'RE GONNA CLAIM THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE COMPETITION. THE LET'S OPEN IT UP AND ALLOW. TRUE COMPETITION TO TAKE PLACE. AND THIS IS REALLY A HISTORIC MOMENT BECAUSE OF WHEATON DIS THE VARIOUS GROUPS HERE THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL HAVE NEVER STOOD TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE. EVER YEAH AND TO TO QUOTE A TO QUOTE [inaudible] ALANIS MORISSETTE. I HAVE TO SAY. ISN'T IT IRONIC [inaudible] NOT. DON'T YOU THINK. A LITTLE TOO IRONIC. THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE OPPOSING THIS BILL. ARE THE FOLKS WHO ARE THE WHO CALL THEMSELVES THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER CHOICE ASSOCIATION AND THEY'RE GONNA COME UP AND OPPOSE CHOICE. I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CHOICE LET'S LET THE CONSUMERS CHOOSE LET'S OPEN UP THE MARKETS. AND WE WOULD URGE AYE VOTE FOR THAT REASON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EQUITY MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION -- I HAVE NOT HEARD LANCE MORE SET COULDN'T TESTIMONY BEFORE THAT -- AS THE FIRST BUT I I DO THINK IS VERY FASTENING THAT WE ARE HERE TOGETHER MANUFACTURERS AND LABOR WORKING TOGETHER TO PROMOTE. A OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE AFFORDABLE ENERGY. FOR MANUFACTURERS THAT EMPLOYEE -- VIENEN VALUED HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS ON THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY -- TO CREATE GOOD PAYING MIDDLE CLASS JOBS THAT HELP RAISE UP OUR OUR COMMUNITIES. IMPORTANT CONTEXT TO NOTE OUR RATES ARE 80% EIGHTY SIX FOR NATIONAL RATE PAYERS ARE. EIGHTY SIX HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WERE A HUNDRED AND 13% HIGHER. THAN OUR NEIGHBORING WESTERN STATES. NOW WE'RE TWO TIMES -- THE THE PRICE IN THE VALLEY THAT ARIZONA OR AGAIN WERE NEARLY THREE TIMES THE PRICE OF THE ELECTRICITY WASHINGTON STATE. I WON'T MENTION THAT YOU KNOW STATE WITH A SOUTHWESTERN STATE -- THAT FREQUENTLY IS CITED IN CALIFORNIA -- BUT IT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS AS WELL -- EVEN STATES LIKE IDAHO -- WHICH ARE STARTING TO DRAW MORE MANUFACTURING ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PRICE ELECTRICITY AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ELECTRICITY. IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS IN SOME CASES EVEN MORE A HOUSE SOMEWHERE SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE COSTS. THEN THE LABOR IS FOR THAT MATTER. ODD THAT WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE THAT MORE AFFORDABLE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY AT UNDER THIS BILL -- WITH THE LIFTING OF THE CAP IT ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL STILL HAVE TO MEET THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY -- RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE TO MEET -- THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD REQUIREMENTS AS WELL -- BUT WHAT INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS WANT WHAT THEY NEED IS ANOTHER CHOICE IS ANOTHER OPTION FOR MORE AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY. I GOES TO THE HEART OF THEIR COMPETITIVENESS THIS BILL WE BELIEVE GETS US A GOOD WAYS TOWARDS THAT. IS THAT THE ENTIRE SOLUTION NO ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR DID TO HELP BRING THOSE COSTS DOWN. ABSOLUTELY AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBVIOUSLY IT'S HERE MUCH SAKE SHE MAY HAS ON YET UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO DEAL WITHOUT AS WELL AS OTHERS ON THE COMMITTEE. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE AS ELL FAST FOR SUPPORT ON S. B.. TWO THIRTY SEVEN A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHAEL ROCKS WHEN I AM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL PROJECT FOR UTILITY RATE REDUCTION WHICH IS SO CALLED SPUR. WERE GROUP OF OVER. TWO HUNDRED COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES OF IT. BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WE DO AGGREGATED PROCUREMENTS IN THE UTILITY FIELD INCLUDING NATURAL GAS LED LIGHTS AND CONTROL SOLAR ENERGY. AT DIRECT AXIS ELECTRICITY UNLIMITED BASIS AS TO THE EXTENT IT'S BEEN ALLOWED. ADAM AND WE'RE HERE TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR REMOVING THESE VERY ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS ON OUR ABILITY TO SHOP FOR ELECTRICITY. WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHAT SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS ON A LIMITED BASIS DUE TO THE THE THE CURRENT CONSTRAINTS ON DIRECT ACTORS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR MANY YEARS? IS GETTING SUPPLIERS TO COMPETE TO SERVICE COMPETE ON PRICE COMPETE ON TERMS COMPETE ON SERVICE -- WE CAN DE WEEKEND IT DEPLOY VARIOUS TACTICS TO PROTECT OUR BUDGETS TO GET THE LOWEST COST TO GET THE SERVICES THAT WE WANT. THIS IS THE SAME THING THAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO AND BASICALLY EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF OUR PROCUREMENT SYSTEM COMPETE. AND THAT'S WE WANT TO DO WILL HELP WHICH ALLOW US TO DO THAT WITHOUT THE CONTINUING ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS THAT IMPOSED ON US RIGHT NOW. WITH THE 15% CAP THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHARE A MEMBERS I'M DAVID PHILLIPS AND THE ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT -- I'M HERE TODAY TO STATE -- ARE YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THAT WOULD EXPAND DIRECT ACCESS. ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY IN THE DIRECT ACCESS BUSINESS -- WE SET A GOAL TO BECOME ENTIRELY CARBON NEUTRAL BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND DIRECT AXIS IS ONE OF OUR KEY STRATEGIES TO DO THAT -- WE CURRENTLY SUPPLY ALL. SEVEN OF OUR CAMPUSES AND THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN WILDLY SUCCESSFUL FOR THE UNIVERSITY -- IN TERMS OF REDUCING EMISSIONS AND CUTTING COSTS FOR OUR CAMPUSES AND EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW THE REMAINING CAMPUSES TO JOIN WITH THIS PROGRAM. AND SHARE IN THAT SUCCESS SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR EXPANSION OF DIRECT ACCESS TO DISPEL. THANK YOU OTHERS TO LEND THEIR VOICES IN SUPPORT. BUT IF YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST DEPENDS ON BEHALF OF TECHNET WE'RE IN SUPPORT AND ALSO I THINK MISTER WEST FROM PUTTING A SONG IN MY HEAD THAT I HAVEN'T. HAD STUCK THERE IN MANY MANY YEARS TOPICS. JUDY HE IS A THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS REPRESENTING THE FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR IN USING THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THEO PALE SERBS IN THE ALLIANCE FOR RETAIL ENERGY MARKETS -- WE SUPPLY THE ELECTRICITY FOR THESE CUSTOMERS POT AS WELL AS DIRECT ACCESS CUSTOMER COALITION WHICH REPRESENTS THE BUSINESSES THAT TAKE THAT'S JUST ONE LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND MEGAWATTS SIXTEEN HUNDRED CUSTOMERS. THERE WAITING TO EXPAND WRECKED ACCESS AND AND EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY GOOD FOR WORKERS THANK YOU. SURELY NOT ASK ABOUT HAVE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE IN SPORT. REX EVERY TIME ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S PROP DISSOCIATION SUPPORT. GAVIN MCCUE SHELL ENERGY NORTH AMERICA IN SUPPORT. SILVIO FOR I AM TO HAVE A CARGILL IN SUPPORT. IT'LL BE A SILLY SHAUN BEHALF OF ADVANCED ENERGY ECONOMY WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FORMALIZING OUR SUPPORT POSITION LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS IN THE FORWARD. SCOTT SAT ON BEHALF OF JUST ENERGY IN SUPPORT. AMY BROWN ON BEHALF OF ALBERTSON'S SAFEWAY IN SUPPORT. ERIN MORAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. MARY WHILE WITH THIS YES YOU WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND WE URGE ARRIVE VOTE. MARGOT PARKS THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DON GILBERT FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICES SATIATION JUST WANT TO CLARIFY IN CASE ANYONE WAS CONFUSED BY MISTER WHITE IS TESTIMONY THAT COUNTY CA DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL I KNOW HE WAS REFERRING TO SOMEONE ELSE. BUT JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR ALSO HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS AROUND A LOT IN THESE ISSUES WHEN -- WHEN THAT THE AUTHOR WAS SPEAKER IN DEALING WITH THEM AND I HAVE UTMOST RESPECT FOR HIS VIEW OF OUR ENERGY ISSUES THANKS A LOT? AND SO NOW WILL OF WELCOME. ONE TO BE A WITNESS TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE THAT FRIEDMAN AGAIN WITH THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK I'M NOT REPRESENTING COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS I'M REPRESENTING RATEPAYERS AND SPECIFICALLY RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYERS. AND I BELIEVE THAT SENATOR HERTZBERG DID IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY FACING IN ACHIEVING MANY OF ITS POLICY GOALS BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T ACTUALLY RESOLVE ANY OF THEM. I'M IN FACT WE BELIEVE THAT WILL MAKE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE STATE'S POLICY GOALS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. AND THIS IS THE MOST. BOB MAJOR AND FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSED CHANGE TWO THE STATE'S ELECTRICITY MARKETS SINCE THE ADOPTION OF ASSEMBLY BILL. EIGHTEEN NINETY AND THIS WOULD. THIS IS A THIS REPRESENTS A VERY SIGNIFICANT SHIFT. AND IT SHOULD RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND ARGUE IT WOULD UNDERMINE STATE POLICY GOALS AND DESTABILIZE ELECTRICITY MARKETS. ARMED WITH RESPECT THE CCA'S WE EXPECT THIS WOULD CREATE A CRISIS FOR THEM ESPECIALLY THE CCA STRUGGLING TO OBTAIN CREDIT RATINGS AND TO ENTER INTO FINANCE CIVIL COMMITMENTS FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY RESOURCES. ON DIRECT ACCESS SUPPLIERS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO SERVE AND INSTEAD THEY OPERATE UNDER ESSENTIALLY A CHERRY PICKING MODEL WERE ONLY THE MOST LUCRATIVE CUSTOMERS ARE OFFERED CONTRACTS. THIS APPROACH CONTRASTS SHARPLY WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES AND EVEN THE CCA'S THAT PROVIDE UNIVERSAL SERVICE ON NON DISCRIMINATORY PRICES AND TERMS. I WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT DURING THE TO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE ENERGY CRISIS DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS DUMPED MOST OF THEIR CUSTOMERS BACK TO THE UTILITIES IN ACTION THAT EXACERBATED COST PRESSURES ON CUSTOMERS WHO NEVER CHOSE TO SWITCH. FOR EXAMPLE ENRON PERHAPS THE LARGEST DIRECT ACCESS SUPPLIER AT THE TIME. ON DUMP THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BACK TO UTILITY SERVICE BECAUSE IT'S ON OPPORTUNITY TO RESELL THE POWER IT HAD BOUGHT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA INTO THE WHOLESALE MARKET AND MAKE A LARGE PROFIT. THIS WAS CONSIDERED EFFICIENT ECONOMIC BREACH WE COULD SEE A SIMILAR RESULT IF THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH ENERGY MARKETS. DIRECT ACCESS IS DOMINATED BY SHORT TERM CUSTOMERS AND SHORT TERM WHOLESALE COMMITMENTS. IT'S SATISFYING RESOURCE PLANNING AND STATE POLICY OBJECTIVES REQUIRES LONG TERM COMMITMENTS TO DRIVE NEW INVESTMENT. BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM INVOLVES DEEP INTERDEPENDENCE CHOICES MADE BY SOME CUSTOMERS TO GO SHORT CAN AFFECT ALL CUSTOMERS. SO WHO IS GOING TO BE LEFT TO MAKE THE LONG TERM COMMITMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THE STATE NEEDS TO FIGURE THIS OUT BEFORE CONSIDERING AN UNLIMITED EXPANSION OF DIRECT ACCESS. AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS STRUGGLING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT AN ANSWER. THEY HAVEN'T DEMONSTRATED THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DIRECT LONG TERM CORE PROCUREMENT AND RESOURCE PLANNING IN A FRAGMENTED RETAIL MARKET. THEY'VE IDENTIFIED MANY GAPS IN THE FRAMEWORK AS PART OF THEIR GREEN BOOK PROCESS. AND AS REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS DOWN THIS BILL PRODUCED BY THE COMMITTEE. THERE LITERALLY IS NO PLAN TO COORDINATE THE ACTIVITIES OF VARIOUS RETAIL PROVIDERS. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT PRIOR BILLS THAT WERE CONSIDERING EXPANSIONS OF DIRECT ACCESS THAT WERE ENACTED RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL DEBATE FROM THE LEGISLATURE HERE WE ARE IN THE SECOND HOUSE IN THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE. THIS APPEARS TO BE THE ONLY CHANCE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AND WHILE THE AUTHORS PRIOR BILL TO EXPAND DIRECT ACCESS ON WOULD HAVE INCLUDED GUARANTEES THAT DIRECT ACCESS CUSTOMERS WOULD ACHIEVE 1100% RENEWABLE PORTFOLIOS. NO SUCH REQUIREMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. AS A RESULT. ON THE DIRECT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD EXPECT THE DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS WILL ENGAGE IN MINIMUM COMPLIANCE WITH STATE REQUIREMENTS. AND I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM IMAGINING THAT THE ANECDOTES YOU HEAR ABOUT CUSTOMERS SEEKING TO OBTAIN HIGHER RENEWABLE PORTFOLIOS ARE INDICATIVE OF THE TYPICAL DIRECT ACCESS CUSTOMER WHO SIMPLY IS LOOKING TO GET THE CHEAPEST ENERGY. AS A PRACTITIONER I CAN TELL YOU THAT ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE DIRECT ACCESS SERVE ACT SERVICE. ROUTINELY CLAIM CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS FOR BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR RETAIL SALES IN ABOUT THE RESOURCE PORTFOLIOS AND AS A RESULT WE KNOW SO MUCH LESS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING THAN WE DO ABOUT WHAT THAT I'LL USE. P. O. USE AND CCA'S ARE DOING. SO MORE DIRECT ACCESS IN EFFECT MEANS LESS TRANSPARENCY AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN PROVIDING MEANINGFUL PUBLIC OVERSIGHT THIS BILL DOES NOT PROPOSE A FIX THAT PROBLEM. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THE ROAD THAT THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES AND TO NOT APPROVE THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. HEARING NONE WILL WILL BRING IT BACK -- TO THE DIES -- SENATOR YOUR YOUR YOUR ALL YOUR ONE WHO ALWAYS THINKS OUTSIDE THE BOX AND PUSHES THE ENVELOPE AND AS TIME. LOOKING FOR WAYS OF CONTINUING TO FIND WAYS OF INCREASING CHOICE AS YOU POINTED OUT. OUR AND ALSO BRINGING DOWN THE COST NEVER EXPECT AND APPRECIATED -- I HAVE NO RECOMMENDATION ON THIS BILL A TODAY -- BUT I MUST AT GIVEN VP UC'S VALUATION OF THE MARKETPLACE AND REALLY MOVE IN THE CAP. I AT THIS TIME THE INSTABILITY THAT WOULD CREATE IN THE MARKETPLACE -- I DO RECOGNIZE THAT AND HAVE SOME CONCERN OF WHAT THAT REPRESENTS. OF SO WITH THAT I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR AS TO HOW THIS MIGHT OF VIEW THIS PARTICULAR BILL. BUT I DO I'M ALWAYS RESPECT YOU AND AND YOUR POSITIONS. A DOCTOR EGGMAN -- THANK YOU AND AND THINK IF CENTER BETHESDA ON THE CHAIR SAID YOU. ALWAYS COME AT THINGS VERY THOUGHTFULLY AND I APPRECIATE AND AND YOU LIKE TO DO BIG THINGS -- I'M ALSO REMINDED OF A OF A THE SONGWRITER AND BUT JANICE JOPLIN. FREEDOM'S JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE -- AND THAT'S WHAT I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT -- RIGHT THIS IS BEEN DESCRIBED BY IDENTIFIED IN IN THE GREEN BOOK AS SOMETHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CRITIC CRISIS WITHOUT SOME KIND OF CAP -- I THINK I CERTAINLY HEAR FROM -- A LOT OF INDUSTRY LOUD AND CLEAR THAT THAT THAT COSTS ARE TOO HIGH. RIGHT AND IT'S VERY HARD TO DO BUSINESS IN THE IN THE CURRENT MARKET THAT WE LIVE IN WITH INCREDIBLY HIGH. I'M A COST OF OF OF ENERGY AND AYE I AGAIN I APPLAUD YOUR WILLINGNESS TO CUT IT TO HAVE TO GET IN HERE. SO BUT NO WE DID THIS WITH TURKEY O. THERE WERE SOME CAPS IN PLACE. AND NOW WE'RE TALKING AND THAT WAS ON AN INDIVIDUAL MARKET NOR TALK ABOUT GOING LARGER. WHY NO CAPS [inaudible] AND AND IF AND BUT AND AGAIN. EVERY EVERY WEEK WE SAID THIS COMMITTEE WE KEEP TALKING WE NEED A LARGER ORGANIZING MODEL TO BE ABLE LOOK AT OUR ENERGY GOING FORWARD AND WE KEEP JUST. CREW DOING MORE BILLS. I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND I THINK THE IMPACT OF HOW THEY INTERSECT WITH EACH OTHER AND HAVE. THE IMPACT ON ON ON ON THE CONSUMER RIGHT WHICH IS THE BUDGET THE BOTTOM LINE THAT I THINK. POLICY MAKERS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE FOR THE CONSUMER HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THEM. SO CAN YOU ANSWERS LIKE Y. NO CAP. WOULD YOU SEE THIS GOING THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION OR IS THIS YOUR END PRODUCT. RIGHT SHOULD BE MOVING ON TODAY BECAUSE YOU WON'T BECAUSE IT CAN USE THAT OR IS THIS IT. AND I WONDER WHY THE UTILITIES ARE SILENT. TALKED ABOUT THAT TAPE OKAY SO TANACH I I'M NOT SO IS MUSICALLY INCLINED BUT I WANT TO BE INSPIRED BY JACK KENNEDY IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT. PUTTING SOMEBODY ON THE MOMENT AND IT A PERSON A HUMAN BEING ON THE MONET SAYS WE'RE NOT DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S EASY WOODLAND BECAUSE IT'S HARD. WELL THAT WAS NINETEEN SIXTY ONE TODAY PUTTING SOMEBODY ON THE MOAN IS A LOT EASIER WE'VE LEARNED A LOT. AND EVEN FROM THE TIME WHEN IT IS TO SPILL FOUR YEARS AGO THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT. I THINK INFORMED THE REASON WHY THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WHICH WORK THEIR CASH BECAUSE OUT TO COME OUT AGAINST ME LAST TIME AROUND FOR YEARS AGO HAVEN'T SHOWN UP. AND HERE'S THE REASON. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS THAT TO ADVANCE THE BALL. IT IS EASY TO COME UP AND SAY THE SKY IS FALLING IN THE SCARE POLICYMAKERS. THAT WAS DONE IN SO MANY ISSUES THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY ALWAYS THE WAY TO KILL SOMETHING BUT WE HAVE ENGAGE IN EXTRAORDINARILY THOUGHTFUL DELIBERATION AND CONSIDERATION. IN TRYING TO CHANGE THIS MARKET WHAT HAVE WE DONE FIRST. IT S. B. THREE FIFTY WE SAID THAT THIS OUR PS STANDARD OF THE TIME I DID THIS WE DIDN'T HAVE S. B. THREE FIFTY IS 50% IF S. B. BEST BE ONE HUNDRED PASSES. IT'S GOING TO BE A 100% IN TERMS OF THE OUR PS IN MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER THAT CHOICES IS APPROPRIATELY ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE [inaudible] TO THE WHOLE COST SHIFTING ARGUMENT WHICH NO ONE MADE AND THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THAT THE UTILITIES ARGUED LAST TIME THAT SOMEHOW. WE'RE NOT A WOULD HAVE A COST SHIFTING THAT THAT'S JUST ABOUT RIGHT THAT THAT QUITE FRANKLY WAS THE CORE OF THE OPPOSITION LAST TIME THERE'S A VAPID Y.. BECAUSE THE L. BECAUSE THINK MATURITY OF THE PROCESS AND THE CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD HAS SHIFTED AWAY. ARM. UNION YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. IT AND THE RELIANCE ON THE OUR PS IS CREATED IN MY JUDGMENT A DIFFERENT MARKET THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE. THE OTHER ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE THAT TRIED TO TANK THIS WAS WELL THERE'S NO LONG TERM CONTRACTS WELL S. B. THREE FIFTY DID THAT. TO SO THE READ THE REASON THIS IS COULD YOU KNOW SEE OLD SCHOOL OF OLIVE WOULD GO HOME SAYS WHEN THE REASON BUT NO WHICH AT THAT WITH THE ART WHEN THE REASON FOR THE RULE SEIZE THE RULE SEIZE I CAN'T REMEMBER LATIN. THE POINT IS THAT. THERE'S IMPORTANT REASONS TO DO STUFF AND THAT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED WE ARE NOW IS THE CHAIRMAN WAS TRYING TO DO REGIONALIZATION. CLEARLY MUST TO PASS OF THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE. WHAT'S HE DOING WE'RE LITERALLY IN THIS SITUATION DID PASSED BETTER KNOW WHATEVER WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WHOLE. PARA. OF WAS BUT BILL A VAGUE MEAN LIKE THIS ONE HERE YOU MEAN OKAY BUT ANY INNOCENT GETS WATERY BUT IN ANY EVENT THE POINT IS THAT. WE LITERALLY PAYING PEOPLE TO TAKE ENERGY THINGS THAT WE JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE BEFORE SO THAT THAT THE COST PROTECTIONS ARE THERE. THE AND THEN ALSO YOU CAN HEAR FROM US OR YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY HEARD YOU HEAR THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY BILL THE OTHER COMPONENT PIECE WAS WHICH WE PUT IN. WAY BACK IN THE STONE AGE WAS THIS NOTION OF RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS A COMPANION BILL TO DO A DIRECT ACCESS IS RESOURCE ADEQUACY. SO THIS IS LITERALLY A BUT TO GET TO YOUR POINT ABOUT BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS I'M NOT TRYING TO JUST WING IT IT'S IT IS BELTS AND SUSPENDERS IT IS THE EVOLUTION OF THE IDEA. THAT YOU DON'T HAVE INVESTOR OWNS HERE WHO WERE KILLING ME LAST TIME BECAUSE WE'VE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM. THIS CCA'S I'M A PIXIE CA I BELIEVE IN THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY GIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMUNITIES TO DO ALL SORTS OF STUFF. YOU CAN'T HAVE ONLY ONE GROUP THAT GETS IT. WE HAVE THESE UNDERLYING CHALLENGES THE WHOLE MORE HIGH RIVER WOULD DUKE ENERGY CAME TO LOS ANGELES AND THEY START TO SELL YOUR SOUL THE WORLD AND STUFF. AND THE LAST ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE WHEN YOU USE THE WORD AND RON RIGHT IT'S LIKE OLD MY GOD THAT'S JUST A BUZZ WORD FOR BAD STUFF. WELL GUESS WHAT. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MANAGERZONE SYSTEM I THINK SAN DIEGO LAST TIME I TESTIFIED NO ONE IS NOW AT 88%. WHAT WHAT IT WAS SEVEN CAMPUSES THE ALL MANAGE THEIR OWN STUFF THE VOTE THAT THERE WERE INTERNAL PEOPLE THEY'RE CLAMORING FOR THIS STUFF BECAUSE THEY WANT TO REDUCE COSTS WHICH HAS ALL SORTS OF IMPACTS ON VARIOUS THINGS? IT SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS TWENTY YEARS LATER. EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF OF ACTIVITY GOING ON EXTRAORDINARY NUMBERS OF A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT UNDERLYING SOLVES THE ARCHITECTURE AND I MARRY THIS THIS DIRECT ACCESS WITH RESOURCE ADEQUACY WHICH BASICALLY IMPOSES THE OBLIGATION FOR EVERYBODY HAVE A PLAN IN ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE THE PLAN LAST BUT THE PROBLEM. LAST TIME AND PLACES LIKE ENRON DUMPING. THE UC IT CAN'T HAPPEN NOW RIGHT THERE'S ALL SORTS OF CONSEQUENCES TO ALL THAT SO WE'VE LITERALLY RE STRUCTURED THE PLAYING FIELD THAT ACTUALLY NOW I WOULD SUGGEST. BEFORE I DIDN'T HAVE A CAP BECAUSE I WAS JUST TRYING TO MOVE IT UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THAT WAS SUCH A HUGE COMPRESSION A HUGE DEMAND. FOR THE MARKETPLACE THOSE TRY TO GIVE A LITTLE BUT I HAD ROOM I THINK IT TOOK ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO FILL UP THE MARKET LAST TIME. AND JUST WE DO SOME OF THAT COMPRESSION NOW WHAT I'M DOING IS TAKING IN THE MARKET IS SAYING LOOK WE HAVE MATURED OUR POLICY IT IS NOW TIME TO CHANGE. I HOPE THAT HELPS YEAH SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY. CONCERNED WITH THE CPU SEE SAYING [inaudible] THEY'RE CONCERNED. ABOUT AN ENERGY CRISIS YEAH I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THE I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW THE EACH IT'S IT LOOK I LIVE THROUGH IT YOU KNOW IT IT WAS JUST MONEY DEMING WELL BALANCED. THE THROUGH IT THE POINT OF DEFAULT YES. HIT DIFFERENT SEAT TO SAY THE LEAST APOLOGIZE I DON'T MEAN TO ME THAT BUT WE JUST AYE I'M STILL FEELING OKAY I HAVE STILL PERSONALLY FEEL IT SO. BUT IN ANY EVENT -- THAT THE POINT IS THAT THAT. THERE ARE ENOUGH OUR CONSTRAINTS IN MY JUDGMENT THAT WE'VE DONE THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE ME I'M SCREAMIN ON THE WHOLE THING WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRES IN THE LIABILITIES. THAT I LOOK AT THAT AS A MUCH BIGGER RISK PERSONALLY ON ENERGY CRISIS BECAUSE IT A CRISIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ENERGY ALL HAD TO DO WITH. PRICING AND THE ABILITY OF OF THE MARKETS TO TANK US AND NOT THESE THINGS OUT AND HAVE THESE INVESTOR CHOOSE GO BANKRUPT WE PICKED UP THE TAB FORTY THREE BILLION BUCKS IT WAS A FINANCIAL NOT AN ENERGY CRISIS. AND I SEE THE SAME THING THAT SCARES ME MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT WE'RE FACING NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR BUT OKAY -- BUT FORGIVE ME I'M JUST A SUB HERE NEW AROUND HERE AND SO FAST. A COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE ARM OPPONENT. ABOUT THE CUSTOMER DUMPING ABOUT LACK OF I'M OVERSIGHT AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU. ARE WILLING TO ADDRESSES THE BILL GOES FORWARD IT SEEMS THAT YOU HAVE THAT OPEN A DOCUMENT IN WHICH YOU CAN. EXTEND SOME OF THE SAME TYPES OF PROTECTIONS -- SAME TYPES OF REGULATIONS RIGHT ON THIS FAIR I THINK ANY OF THOSE KINDS OF LIKE WHEN YOU ARGUE THE AND ONE ARGUMENT TO ME THAT SINCE INTO RESTOCK THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA I JUST WENT BACK AND ASKED THEM AGAIN TO MAKE SURE I WAS RIGHT. DID THEY RUN THEIR OWN PROGRAM THAT UNDER CONTRA I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS YOU YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING IT TO A GROUP THAT DOESN'T HAVE MAYBE THE SAME KIND OF PURCHASE POWER SO I'M ALL I'M ASKING IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD ON TIGHTER RESIDENTIAL. SOME REPLIES TO COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL OKAY I'M SORRY ZERO BUTTON BUT IT'S STILL POINT IS ARE YOU WILLING TO OF COURSE TAKE A LOOK AT MAYBE ADDING SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE. AND SECOND WE JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW THIS IS A NEW AREA FOR ME. YEAH UNDER THIS BILL ARE UNDER CURRENT LAW REMEMBER BAKER GLYNDEBOURNE. I THINK OUT OF THE UTILITY NO WE ONLY UTILITY OF WHAT THE SHOW SO HAPPENS WITH -- SO -- SO DOES THIS AND TO DO THESE ENTITIES CREATE THEIR OWN TRANSMISSION CHU THIS OR ARE THE UTILITIES OBLIGATED TO ALLOW TRANSMISSION ACROSS THEIR LINES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IS. OUR MISTER CHAIRMAN THEO PAY US FOR THE LINES FOR RETAIL ENERGY MARKETS. KNOW IT THIS WORKS LIKE IT'S THE CHAU ALL ALL THESE ENTITIES ARE DOING -- ALL OF ALL THESE ALL THAT WE'RE DOING IS. CURING THE ENERGY THEY ARE ACTUALLY STILL CUSTOMERS OF THE UTILITY BECAUSE A PLAN FOR THE TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND ALSO. AFFORD BEFORE THEIR A. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY. ACCESS DIRECT ACCESS ENERGY THEY HAVE TO PAY A DEPARTING LOW CHARGE OF AFTER PAVE UTILITY BACK FOR ALL THE INVESTMENTS VETO THE PARTY MADE OKAY SO THAT THERE IS A THERE IS A SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF THE TRANSPARENCY. IT CERTAINLY BE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN VERY TRANSPLANTS PARA WE'VE COMPLIED WITH WITH THE OUR PS YES OUR ACTUAL CONTRACTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS ARE CONFIDENTIAL. BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE ALL THE CUSTOMERS KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE PROTECT PROPRIETARY CONTRACTS ARE BUT OTHERWISE WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTHCOMING IT AND AND IT'S A MOMENT SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF OF Q. -- I THINK ONE THING TO UNDERSTAND IS IT WHEN WE DID THE LAST OUR PS BILL THE THE ESPYS RELIGIOUS SERVICE PROVIDERS. THEY HAVE TO LIVE TO THE SAME RP A STANDARD AS IT AND IT BY THEY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE P. YOU SEE. THAT THEY ARE MEETING THERE ARE PS GOALS THERE ALSO REQUIRED TO SIGN LONG TERM CONTRACTS UNDER SP THREE FIFTY JUST LIKE UTILITIES ARE AT A THAT GOT A LITTLE MUDDLED INDIA. EARLIER DOESN'T. OKAY THANK YOU. YEAH I GOT KILLED LAST TIME BY LONG TERM CONTRACTS INVEST JOINT BECAUSE INVESTOR TO SORT ABOUT THAT. AND I GET KILLED BY THE COST SHARING ISSUE AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT THERE WAS A FAIRNESS. THE IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WILL HAVE THIS ON THROUGH IN THAT TIME CHINA FOR A SWEETENER IN TO SHOW GOOD FAITH THAT OKAY FINE WILL BALANCE OUT RISK IN WILL BALANCE OUT POLICY. NOW ALL THAT'S MATURED IN THE LONG LOST FOUR YEARS SO WE THINK IT'S IT MAKES SENSE FINALLY SANTIAGO [inaudible] ONE DUCT WORK. SO HERE IS MY CONCERN. WE ARE ALREADY. THE ENERGY SITUATION IS PRECARIOUS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I TOOK THE UNFORTUNATE IT -- MEASURE OF OVERTURNING THE CHAIR ON SB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT IS I AM VERY CONCERNED. WITH ALL OF THE THREATS. GOING ON TO THE UTILITY'S FINANCIAL WELL BEING. ARE THEY ARE ALREADY TERRIBLY CHALLENGED BY THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION. AND THEY ALREADY HAVE THEIR RD CELINE ASSETS FOR DIMES ON THE DOLLAR -- THIS IS GOING TO RESULT IN MORE STRANDED ASSETS WITHOUT ABILITY TO RECOVER. THIS MEANS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO REMAIN WHO ARE PRIMARILY I BELIEVE IN REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS BUT THE PEOPLE WHO REMAIN WITH UTILITIES. ARE GOING TO PAY MORE MONEY. AND THE CCA'S I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM UNDER THIS BUT THEY PROBABLY LOSE CUSTOMERS AS WELL. UP BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT WE WILL HAVE STRANDED AT MORE STRANDED ASSETS. I THINK IF WE'RE GOING LOOK AT THIS IT OUGHT TO BE AFTER WE HAVE. GONE THROUGH THE STORM OF THE CCA'S. AND WE SEE IF OUR UTILITIES CAN STAND ON THEIR AND THE WILDFIRES AND SEE IF WE COULD STAND ON OUR OWN TWO FEET. THE CCA'S ARE ALREADY DAMAGING THE SYSTEM. SO MUCH THAT I AM VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE LIFE BRENT WOODS AND THE FIRES THAT I'M VERY WORRIED. ABOUT THE PEOPLE LEFT ON THE UTILITIES AND THE CHARGES THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. AND THE WORKERS WHO WILL NO LONGER BE WORKING IN UNION PLANTS OH BY. AND CONTRACTED BY YOU TILT THINK OUR CURRENT UTILITIES THAT'S MY CONCERN. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST THAT THE TICKETS ARE JUST QUICKLY THAT WERE WITHOUT IT. YEAH I I GOTTA TELL YOU IT'S THE SAME THING THE STRANDED ASSETS ARGUMENT. YOU KNOW I I I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE EXPERT ANY EXPERIENCE AND TALKING TO REPRESENTATIVES OF ADVOCATES FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BUT THEY'RE NOT SHY PEOPLE. AND THEY DO THEIR HOMEWORK IF IF THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WE DEALT WITH IN THE ENERGY CRISIS WE DON'T WITH ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES WE DEALT WITH WITH THE LAST TIME I HAD THIS BILL FOUR YEARS AGO. AND THEY WERE HERE AND FORCE MAKING THAT ARGUMENT. THEY'RE NOT HERE TODAY THERE THAT THEY'RE THE ONES ARE GONNA GET STUCK WITH THE STRESSES THEY'RE THE ONES WHOSE BALANCE SHEETS ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY THAT IN MY JUDGMENT. AND AND AND AND AND THEY THEY CLEAR THE WHAT THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENED JUST REAL QUICKLY AND SO COST SHIFTING WOULD WHERE YOU HAD THE STATE ASSETS BECAUSE THE IDEAS CHAD ASSETS IS AN ASSET NOT THAT DOESN'T YOU GET ACCUSED. BUT GET DOESN'T GET TAKEN CARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING STANDPOINT AND THAT'S HIS WHOLE POWER DIFFERENCE ADJUSTMENT AND HOW THAT ALL OF THEM IN THE HOLE JUST MISSING KAUSHIK THING WORKS. AND THAT WAS THE THING IN THE WERE [inaudible] TO PAPERS AND THEY WERE ARGUING Y. WHAT I SAID WAS WRONG AND NOW. THE REASON WHY I SUPPORTED S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT YEAH WAS NOT BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE UTILITIES I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE RATE PAYERS. AND IT IS THE RATE PAYERS WHO ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THOSE STRANDED ASSETS IT IS THE RATE PAYERS WHO ARE NOT ON CCA'S WHO ARE GOING TO GET A* DEAL OUT OF THIS. AND THAT'S WHY I AM OPPOSED TO THE BILL [inaudible] ABOUT [inaudible] IT'S MURATSUCHI [inaudible] QUESTION WHAT. YOU MENTIONED EARLIER. THE PROBLEM OF BALKANIZATION. ISN'T THIS MORE BALKANIZATION. NO I I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS AN HONOR MERE CITY I THINK WHAT IT IS IS IT'S ARE. YOU HAVE NOW LITTLE TINY POCKETS. OF BECAUSE I COMPETITION A BIT EXIST AROUND THE STATE IT BUT NOT OVER THE ENTIRE STATE. AND IS WITH THIS WILL DO IS GIVE A CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY CONTROL THEIR OWN DESTINY. AND NOT JUST BE SWEPT INTO ONE PARTICULAR PROVIDER BECAUSE THEY WERE SWEPT IN AND THEY HAVE TO OPT OUT. WE'RE IS IN EVERY OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT IS IT IS INTRODUCED AROUND HERE IT'S A IT'S AN OPT IN IT'S AN OPT OUT FOR THEM -- THIS WILL -- ALLOW US ALL OUR CUSTOMERS TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT OPTION NOT JUST THOSE ONES IN THE POCKETS IS ACTUALLY. A OPENS IT UP AND DOESN'T -- FOR FURTHER BALKANIZED SYSTEMS. I MADE IT I I CAN'T HELP BUT HEAR YOU SAYING THAT. A SOLUTION. TO LITTLE COUNTRIES BREAKING UP IS [inaudible] TO LET. SMALLER AND SMALLER GROUPS OF OF OF IF PRINT PEOPLE BREAK OFF. TO TO PURSUE THEIR OWN ENERGY FREEDOM HERE. THE IDEA. THAT I I THINK I I CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU MORE CLEARLY THAN I ALREADY DID [inaudible] TECH. WELL SENATOR WE AGAIN. ASSERTING. THANK YOU -- I I I TOLD THE GROUP THE CENTER THAT THAT THE WORLD IS -- I THINK YOU'RE VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS. DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS WE'VE -- WE'VE MOVED TOWARD CCA'S WE'VE MOVED MOVED TOWARD CLEANER ENERGY SOLAR AND WE JUST HAD A HUGE PRESENTATION ARE ON ENERGY STORAGE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. SO OBVIOUSLY THERE IS -- READY PEOPLE MOVING DIRECTLY INTO DIFFERENT. CHOICES HARM NOW GOING BACK TO AYE THICKNESS IN THE FRAGMENTS QUESTION. WHY NOT STILL MAINTAIN A CAP? WHY COMPLETELY REMOVED THE CAP THAT CAPS SEEMS TO BE? A A SAFEGUARD IN CASE THINGS SORT OF GET. OUT OF CONTROL UPON. BECAUSE IT DOES APPEAR THAT -- GIVEN THE YOUR THE THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE WE WENT THROUGH. THAT MUCH OF THE STEPS OF HOME MOVING FORWARD YOU KNOW AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOLAR. THERE CERTAIN CERTAIN STOP GAPS AND NET METERING STOP HAVE TECH SALUTING SCOTT WHICH A BBQ. THEN THAT ONE OF ARGUMENT WOULD WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH HAVING A CAP ON CCA'S I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING LOAD FROM. THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO OTHERS SO IF YOU'RE CONCERNED. WITH NEEDING A CAP DIDN'T WE SHOULD BE KAPLAN CCA'S. BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE LEAVING TO GO TO ANY S. P. OR THEY'RE LEAVING TO GO. UP TO SEE CA OR THEY'RE LEAVING THE GRID BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST BECOMING SELF SUFFICIENT WHICH A LOT OF OTHER BUSINESSES ARE TODAY PEOPLE RE GOING BROWN OFF THE GROUND OFF THE GRID. SO -- I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY. OF CONCERNS FROM FROM FOLKS IN IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT SOMEHOW WE SHOULD BE. YOU KNOW CAPPING HER TO BE PROPOSING LEGISLATION OR AMENDMENTS TO CAP CCA'S. SO I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S CONSISTENT AND AND YOU KNOW WE SHOULD. WE SHOULD OPEN UP AND THAT WE LOOK P. JUDY'S RD LOST 80% OF THEIR LOW TO SEE CA SO -- IF IF IF WE'RE GONNA SEE A CLAMMY WITHIN PGE SERVICE TERRITORY I THINK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SEEN I THINK WE'VE. CROSSED THAT. TIPPING POINT ALREADY AND WE HAVE IT. BUT BUT BUT I GET TO SEE IF YEARS I MEAN YOU HAVE. TO THERE'S A FAIRLY. LENGTHY PROCESS TO HOP DE UNDER. TEAR. YOU NOT YOU KNOW QUITE THE OPPOSITE THERE'S MORE LIKE THE PROCESS FOR DIRECT ACCESS KESSLER'S UNDER CCA'S DEFORMITY CA THEY SWEEP ALL THE CUSTOMERS. THEN YOU'RE STILL GETTING A BILL FROM ITS A PGD YOU'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT THAT NOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING POWER FROM. MARIN CLEAN POWER AND THAT YOU AS A CUSTOMER HAVE TO BE SAVVY ENOUGH TO OPT OUT. UNDER DIRECT ACCESS AND ESP HAS TO GO IN INDIVIDUALLY SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH EACH PERSON SO THEY HAVE TO GO. NEGOTIATED AND SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH OR LABORIOUS TIME INTENSIVE -- THEN CCA'S I'LL USE CAN COMPETE AGAINST YES PLEASE THEY CAN MARKET AND SAY DON'T DON'T SIGN WITH. DUKE POWER STAY WITH US BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA DO X. Y. Z. FOR YOU THEY CAN'T DO THAT WITH CCA'S BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS TIED THEIR HARMS BEHIND THEIR BACK. AND SAID I OWE YOU YOU CANNOT MARKET AGAINST CCA'S. DOCTOR I'M SORRY. BUT I CONTINUE MISTER BALES OF SOME OF OUR YEAH I MANDATE THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE TO ADD THAT OTHER THAN [inaudible] EVERY TIME. A BUSINESS GO TO DIRECT ACCESS IT'S A ONE ON ONE TRANSACTION. THEY HAVE TO GO AND ACTUALLY SIGNED UP AND THEN THEY HAVE TO BEAR PAY THE PCI A WHICH IS LITERALLY PAIN THEM BACK FOR THE INVESTMENTS THAT THEY'VE MADE. SAYS MAKE SURE THERE'S NO STRANDED ASSETS ON TOP OF THAT IF YOU TO BE MAKES TO NEEDS TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT. THEY GO TO THE ENTIRE RATE PAYER NOT JUST OF ERRORS FOR THEY GO ESP CUSTOMERS IT'S CALLED CAMP. AND THEY CHARGE THE CUSTOMER OF THE S. P. COSTS FOR THINGS THAT BENEFIT THE SYSTEM GENERALLY THIS IDEA THAT YOU'RE SOMEHOW LEAVING THE SYSTEM THERE'S NO ONE TO PAY FOR IT. THAT IS FACTUALLY ISN'T. IT BUT JUST UP ABOVE I GUESS THE QUESTION FOR BOND ARM MISTER TINGS POINT OUR EXIT SO WE KNOW THAT CCA'S ARE. HAVE CREATED HAVE CREATED ISSUES. AND YOUR RESPONSE WAS THAT WE WERE JUST GONNA GIVE LIKE CONSUMERS MORE CHOICE BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE EVERYDAY CONSUMER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LARGE. PROCESSING UNIVERSITY SO AGAIN THE RATE PAYER. IF THIS ALL GOES BAD IS THE ONE WHO'S STILL ON THE HOOK IN IS GOING TO SEE THEIR COSTS GO UP CORRECT. WELL BUT THE PUT FOR THIS TO WORK THE THEY HAVE TO HAVE GOOD WITH THE BILL THAT WE HAVE I'VE RESOURCE ADEQUACY. AND LOOKING AT A LARGER DYNAMIC THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS WHAT IS THE BUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME AS TO WHY WHEN THE THING FELL APART LET'S IS THE LET'S JUST ASSUME. THAT YOU'RE RIGHT AND THE WORLD GOES WIGGY BITE WE WE WE CAN ON RESOURCE ADEQUACY WE LITERALLY ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH. PILING PLANS CREATING RESERVES TO CREATE THE BUFFERS SO THAT IF THAT STARTS TO HAPPEN. RIGHT WHAT WE'VE WRITTEN IN THE LAW IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA NO WAY IN ADVANCE PEOPLE HAVE TEMPERATURE THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE MONEY THEY JUST CAN'T CUT OUT AND DROP PEOPLE NUMBER. ONE NUMBER TWO ON THE WHOLE COST SHIFTING THING THAT ALSO CREATES. A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF FACTORS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAW THEY'RE NOT ONLY IF YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE THIS I DON'T WANT TO COME BACK YOU JUST CAN'T SAY. OH BY THE WAY I CHANGE MY MIND. GO AND DO THIS YOU'VE GOTTA PAY THE RATES W. TO PAY FOR THAT PENTECOST YOU HAVE TO PAY HIGHER RATES FOR A TIME TO RECAPTURE TO GET BACK ON YOU IF YOU ALL KINDS OF STUFF SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. THROUGH THE EXPENSE IS BUILT IN THIS REDUNDANCY TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE'S A FAILURE. TO A SYSTEM BECAUSE SOMEBODY WENT OFF THE SYSTEM BUT THERE'S BOTH TIME AND MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK AND SO IF YOU WANT YOU GOT TO HAVE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT ADDITIONAL -- COST RICK. HOW WOULD YOU FINISH? YEAH IT WOULD GIVE TO YOU THIS CAR SCHERING'S YOU'VE IT RECRUITS SEARCH RECOVERY PROBABLY DE ON THE OTHER SET AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRADE. AND SO WE HAVE PUT BELTS AND THE SPENDERS ON TOP A BELT AND SUSPENDERS ON THIS THING SO LOOK. I LIVE FOR THAT BUT WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT. WE WENT. TO YEAH IT CAN WHETHER MIT URGENCY WIFE Y. GOT MEN SO FAST RIGHT NOW WHEN I MEAN. CLEARS LA QUESTIONS IN A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY OPEN BUT WHAT ITS THIRD JUNE TWENTY SIX GOOD STRAWBERRY MOON. SOON EGGMAN POP UP ON YOUR AVERAGE OF IT HAS. WE HAVE A CAP THOSE FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO BE SERVED THERE HASN'T. WE HAVE TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IT JUST HASN'T BEEN BORNE OUT. TO YOUR ARGUE FOR SEIZE IT. I'M TALKING ABOUT DIRECT ACCESS CUSTOMERS. CHAIRMAN I MIGHT ONE ONE ONE ONE MOMENT OKAY YEAH. IF I COULD IF I COULD JUST HAVE YOU PAUSE FOR JUST A MOMENT I WANNA. WE'RE FRIEDMAN YOU'RE STANDING THERE THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT TO ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD HERE IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN [inaudible] I I WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED HAVE BEEN RESOLVED ALREADY. THAT ALL THE POLICIES HAVE BEEN NAILED DOWN IN THE COST SHIFTING PROTECTIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND ELIMINATED. I JUST SPENT WEEKS AND WEEKS BRIEFING ARE A CASE OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OVER THE POWER COST INDIFFERENCE ADJUSTMENT WHICH IS IN FACT THE EXIT FEE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO COLLECT STRANDED COSTS. AND THERE IS Y. DISAGREEMENT THAT THE CHARGE SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK AS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED. AND AND THERE'S WIDE DISAGREEMENT AS TO HOW IT SHOULD BE REFORMED. THE P. YOU SEE HASN'T RESOLVED THIS PROBLEM. THE PC ITSELF HAS IDENTIFIED SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT MARKET FRAGMENTATION AT THE RETAIL LEVEL AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE. AND THEY'VE SOUNDED THE ALARM BELLS THAT WE ARE RUNNING INTO A SITUATION. WHERE THERE MAY BE A SHORTAGE OF CAPACITY WERE RESOURCE ADEQUACY NEEDS ARE NOT BEING THAT? AND WHERE THERE'S NO ONE TO DIRECT TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS AND WE LOOK AT THE EAST EASTERN MARKETS WHERE WE TELL CHOICE IS RUN RAMPANT. ON STATE COMMISSIONS HAVE VERY LITTLE OVERSIGHT AND THEY WERE VERY BIG CHALLENGES TO THE MEETING A LOT OF THEIR RESOURCE GOALS AND WE HAVE SOME. BIGGER GOALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WERE TRYING TO MEET. ON MUCH OF THIS STUFF SIMPLY HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED AND YES YES PIECE HAVE NOT DUMP THEIR CUSTOMERS BACK TO THE UTILITIES BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN NO BIG PROBLEM IN WHOLESALE MARKETS. THE NEXT TIME THAT PROBLEM ARRIVES ALL BETS ARE OFF. AND IF AN E. S. P. GOES BANKRUPT AND ITS CUSTOMERS ARE PUT BACK TO THE UTILITY THERE'S NO ONE TO GO AFTER FOR THE MONEY. WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE. TO AUTHORIZE UNLIMITED RETAIL CHOICE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WITH SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS BOTH HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE REGULATORY AGENCIES OKAY MAG HAPPEN TO CLOSE. I WILL I'LL ANSWER THAT MY CLOTHES WHAT IF WHAT BOOK A QUESTION TO THE SENATOR SODA SO MISTER FRIEDMAN MENTION AGAINST THE LAST BILL YOU HAD. HAD MORE IT ALFA RENEWABLE COMPONENT WAS THERE A REASON WHY YOU DIDN'T. ON YOUR MARKET CERTAIN PORTION FOR RENEWABLES A LOT WE DID WITH FOLLOWING THE LAW RIGHT NOW IT'S ONE HUNDRED WILL PASS AND GET SO WE DID NEED TO HANDLE IT SEPARATELY IT'S GOING TO BE HANDLED IN THE SHIFT TO POLICY QUITE SO WE THINK THINK ON IT I CAN CLOTHES. YOUR INCIDENT OF HIS QUESTIONS I GUESS WHAT I COULD ANSWER THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED IF YOU JUST HOPE REPORT MOMENTOUS. MAKE SURE THAT WE SCALE YOU HAVE. YOU JUST VERY BRIEFLY -- YOU KNOW I I THINK WHAT. WE'RE SEEING IN THIS DISCUSSION IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A LOT OF CONSISTENCY TO OUR OVERALL ENERGY PLAN IT SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW ME ON THE ONE HAND WE WANT TO HAVE MORE MORE PEOPLE WOULD. COME TO GET OFF THE GRID SO TO SPEAK -- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE'RE SAYING NO WHAT WE NEED PEOPLE ON THE GROUP WE NEED AND IN FACT WE NEED REGIONALIZATION RAY AND WE NEED OTHER POWER SOURCES FROM OTHER. YOU KNOW OTHER WESTERN STATES YOU KNOW I'M [inaudible] AND AND IT WILL YOU KNOW ONE THING ON THIS I MEAN CERTAINLY A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT. YOU KNOW THAT -- THAT EMPLOY. PEOPLE IN OUR DISTRICTS WANNA TAKE ADVANTAGE THIS IS NO WONDER. THE OTHER COSTS ARE 89% HIGHER. THAN ANY OTHER STATE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE DOING COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL PRICING SO OF COURSE THEY WANNA. BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND THAT REALLY ALL GOES BACK -- TO OUR PS RIGHT IS WHAT IS REALLY DRIVEN UP THE COST YOU KNOW FOR A LOT OF THESE -- BUSINESSES AND SO BUT WITH THE SAME TIME WE ALSO. MAYBE WE DON'T REALIZATION WHERE WE TAKE NON RENEWABLE RESOURCES -- TO POWER. TO PROVIDE THAT THAT POWER RIGHT SO I MEAN THERE'S JUST. IT IN ON THE SAME TIME WE TALK ABOUT CCA'S WE TALK ABOUT MICRO GRIDS. YOU KNOW WHAT I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT WE NEED TO GET OUT I'D I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK. WE DO NEED TO PROVIDE THIS AND AND AND AND GIVE PEOPLE THE ABILITY BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THE STRAW THAT BREAKING THE CAMEL'S BACK RIGHT I MEAN THAT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE CAUSING. THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IN AND RISE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH. AND THIS IS REALLY A VERY SMALL THING. AND THEN A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY EVEN. FLAT AS AS IN TERMS OF OVERALL CUSTOMERS THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS PARTICULAR DIRECT ACCESS RIGHT -- SO. DEFTLY ON LONG TERM WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER MORE CONSISTENT PLAN OF HOW WE GONNA MAKE THIS ALL WORK -- WE ALL WANT DIFFERENT THINGS IN ALL OF US ARE HAPPY ABOUT CERTAIN ASPECTS AND NOT OTHERS. BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A COHESIVE PLAN I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO THAT HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE A LONG TERM MORE CONCLUSIVE CONSISTENT. PLAN FOR OUR ENERGY NEEDS. IN THE FUTURE. THAT I DON'T THINK ANYONE DISAGREES WITH THAT AND SENATOR WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY I WON'T REPEAT THE THE THE THE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT THE BILL THERE'S NO RECOMMENDATION I AM VOTING NO BUT PLEASE THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE. I HAVE BY. TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE OR THE ENERGY COMMITTEE AND BEEN INVOLVED IN A I KNOW HOW MANY ENERGY RELATED ISSUES OVER THE YEARS. AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DID NOT SHOW UP. SUPPORT OPPOSE WORD VICE. SO WHEN THE ARGUMENTS MADE AGAIN SCOTT. TO POST A BOND. AND IF THERE IS A PROBLEM UNLIKE WHAT WE HAD BEFORE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS IN PLACE. SO WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO. ONE OF THE REASONS I DECIDED TO COME BACK TO GOVERNMENT AFTER WORKING IN RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR TWELVE YEARS AFTER LEAVING GOVERNMENT. WAS TO MOVE AWAY FROM. THE BROAD DISCUSSIONS OF LET'S HAVE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS ARE LET'S GO GREEN AND HAVE A LOT OF PRESS CONFERENCES AND TO GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY OF HOW DO WE DO IT. TO ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS AT EVERY LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THE PROCESS AND NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED BY WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE TO LEARN FROM WHAT WE LEARNED BEFORE AND THEY GET IT RIGHT. HOW WE GONNA GET IT RIGHT NO ONE CAN GUARANTEE HAVE BEEN TO A FEW PERFECT STORMS IN MY LIFE? BUT I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE IS IN THE BALANCE OF THINGS PARTICULAR ENERGY COSTS ARE SO HIGH WERE OPPORTUNITIES ARE SO GREAT. WHERE COMPANIES ARE SO SOPHISTICATED WERE OF THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES I THINK FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO HALVES CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICERS WHERE THE ENTIRE CORPORATE STRUCTURE OF BIG COSTA FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED? AND WE HAVE WON THE WAR. WE HAVE WON THE WAR. IN TERMS OF THE GENERAL THINKING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE LOOK AT SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT HOW THEY BY POWER AND ABOUT HOW THEY DO DO THIS KIND OF THING. THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE IT WAS THE WILD WEST THERE WERE A FEW COMPANIES WHO ARE BOTTOM FEEDERS WHO CAME IN AND PROMISE THE MOON I WATCHED IT HAPPEN IN LOS ANGELES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. SAYING WE'RE GONNA MAKE ALL THIS STUFF HAPPENED PEOPLE BIT. WE NOW HAVE TWENTY YEARS EXPERIENCE TWENTY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DO WITH THIS AT A VERY SOPHISTICATED LEVEL. CCA'S ARE IMPORTANT ARM FORUM I SUPPORTED HIM A VOTER FOR EVERY BILL EVER SEEN ON THEM. THE QUESTION IS CAN WE EXTEND THIS TO OTHER FOLKS THAT IN A FAIR MANNER AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NEXT YEAR THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE IN BUSINESS. NEXT YEAR IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIX IT. AND AND ARMED THE THAT WE'VE BUILT ENOUGH EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS INTO THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE STUCK. WITH THE SITUATION WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN THE SKY'S FALLING OH MY GOD WHAT WE DO. THE BIGGEST ISSUE I THINK WE FACE WITH THESE UTILITIES IS THE FIRES WILL I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BUT I THINK I AGAIN. LOOK AT THAT IN THE CONTEXT THE ENERGY CRISIS WHICH WAS REALLY A FINANCIAL CRISIS I DON'T THINK THAT'LL HAPPEN HERE I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.
