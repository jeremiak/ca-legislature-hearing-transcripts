00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.373
THANK YOU FINANCE WILL MAKE

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.908
THREE BRIEF POINTS OUT FIRST --

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:36.842
WE BELIEVE THAT WE SEVENTY BOND

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:38.677
FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE FOR THESE

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.079
TYPES OF PROJECTS AND CURRENTLY

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:41.714
STATEWIDE THERE OVER A HUNDRED

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.581
PROJECTS THAT USE.

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:44.250
THIS TYPE OF FINANCING.

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:46.151
THE SECOND POINT IS WE BELIEVE

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:47.553
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.455
MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IF WE RELY

00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:50.322
ON CASH FINANCING THAT PUTS

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.157
ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE MOTOR

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:53.626
VEHICLE COUNT IN THE SHORT TERM

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:55.027
AND I KNOW WE WILL BE TALKING

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.095
ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.396
VEHICLES AND JUST A LITTLE BIT.

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.664
BUT MAINTAINING THE HEALTH OF

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.099
THAT ACCOUNT IS AN IMPORTANT

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:01.800
CONSIDERATION FOR ALL OF US.

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.068
INTO THE THIRD POINT IS WE

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:03.969
BELIEVE THAT USING WAYS REVENUE

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:06.238
BOND FINANCING IS A WAY TO

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:07.339
ENSURE THE SOLVENCY OF THAT

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.141
ACCOUNT WHILE MAINTAINING THE

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:15.914
NEED -- TO UPGRADE AND BUILT CHP

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:17.750
FACILITIES.

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:20.753

PROJECTS AND WE THINK ALL THESE

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.594
PROJECTS ARE NECESSARY COULD

FINANCE -- SALLY WHO CAN BUILD

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:06.699
PARTNER FINANCE I WOULD AGREE

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.300
THERE THE TOP THREE PRIORITIES

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:14.073
FOR CHP OFFICE REPLACEMENTS.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:14.640
SEVEN NINE ANSWER FOR YOU --

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:18.577
ESTIMATES.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.479
SO THE MORE LOT WHAT IS THE LIFE

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.214
OF A LEASE BOND. TWENTY FIVE

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.882
YEARS THIRTY ARE GENERALLY

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:25.351
TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO WE'RE GONNA

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:26.452
BE PAYING MAY BE.

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:28.854
THE SAME AMOUNT IN INTEREST OVER

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.990
THE LIFE OF THE OF THE BOND.

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.192
THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT AM I THINK

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:35.728
IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO NOTE THAT --

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:37.029
WITH LEASE WERE LEASE REVENUE

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.864
BOND FINANCING IT HAS UP ON WE

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:40.799
HAVE A LIFE OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:42.368
BUT WHEN CORRECTED -- FOR

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:45.704
INFLATION THE COST OF THAT IS

00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:47.339
THIS LESS THAN THAT THE

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:49.308
ACCUMULATION OF THOSE PAYMENTS --

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.276
AND YOU ALSO CONSIDER THAT --

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:53.379
PROJECTS ESCALATED ABOUT 5% A

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:54.780
YEAR SO FOR EACH YEAR YOU'RE

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.049
AVOIDING FINANCING THE PROJECT

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.784
GETS BY PERCENT MORE EXPENSIVE

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.786
TO CONSTRUCT SO THERE'S KIND OF

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.788
A A MEDIUM POINT WHERE IT.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.324
IT MAKES SENSE YOU KNOW TO NOT

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:07.025
DELAY PROJECTS AND AND JUST GO

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:08.627

BLEND.

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.368

REVENUE YES YES WE HAVE PROPOSED

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.439
THAT AND THAT THAT'S A SOLUTION

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.441

00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:19.171
ACCOUNTFOR THE SENATE TO

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:20.038
REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:22.340
PROPOSAL TO PASS ON THE CREDIT

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:23.575
CARD FEES.

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:24.576
ASSEMBLY ON THE OTHER HAND

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:25.143
APPROVED ONE TIME AND BE A

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.211
FUNDING OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:28.113
AND APPROVED GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.382
TO PASS ON THE CREDIT CARD FEES.

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:31.850
IF YOU LOOK AT THE THIRD LINE --

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.185
THIS IS THEN WHERE WE HAVE

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.853
DIFFERENCES RELATED TO THE

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.054
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE.

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:37.789
THE SENATE APPROVED THE PROPOSED

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:39.324
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO AUGMENT

00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:41.693
DMV'S -- BUDGET WITHIN THIRTY

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.794
DAY NOTIFICATION ASSEMBLY

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.162
REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:46.431
INSTEAD ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:47.766
BE AVAILABLE.

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:48.900
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS A

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:50.235
UPON LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.404
AFTER DMB DEMONSTRATES NEED AND

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:54.339
PROGRESS IN MEETING PERFORMANCE

00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:55.607
MEASURES.

00:22:55.674 --> 00:22:56.908
THE FINAL ITEM I'M ON THIS TABLE

00:22:56.975 --> 00:22:59.044
BEFORE YOU BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:00.946
SIMILAR REPORTING LANGUAGE --

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:02.013
THESE WOULD BE MONTHLY REPORTS

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.115
ON CERTAIN PERFORMANCE MEASURES

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:05.517
INCLUDING OFFICE WAIT TIMES AND

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:07.119
TECHNOLOGY OUTAGES.

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:08.620
I'M IN A REVIEW OF THE PACKAGES

00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:10.355
THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN INCLUDED

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:11.723
SOME KEY ELEMENTS THAT WE

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.958
THOUGHT REALLY WOULD INCREASE

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:14.459
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT.

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:15.861
THE FIRST IS THAT IT PROVIDES

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:17.596
ONE TIME FUNDING -- AND THE

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:18.997
SECOND IS THAT IT REJECTS THE

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:20.632
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AND SO BOTH

00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:22.267
OF THESE WOULD REQUIRE THAN THAT

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.369
DMV COME FORWARD -- AND JUSTIFY

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:25.937
HOW IT COULD USE THE MONEY IN

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:28.273
THE PAST AND HOW IT PLANNED TO

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.407
USE FUNDING IN THE FUTURE THE

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:30.275
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THEY

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:31.276
WOULD NEED AS WELL AS OUR

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:32.410
PROGRESS IN MEETING PERFORMANCE

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:33.378
MEASURES.

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:34.312
THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD DO

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:35.080
IS IT WOULD PREVENT THE

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:36.581
DEPARTMENT FROM SPENDING MONEY

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:38.884
PRIOR TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.385
APPROPRIATING IT.

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:42.154
AND THEN FINALLY -- PASSING ON

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.655
THE CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AS

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:44.623
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:45.924
DEPARTMENTS HAVE DONE SUCH

00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:49.895
EXAMPLES INCLUDE FTP AND EIGHTY

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:52.330
FINANCE.

00:23:52.397 --> 00:23:53.799
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WE KNOW

00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:55.200
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:57.269
AN UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERN AND

00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:58.637
FRUSTRATION.

00:23:58.703 --> 00:23:59.671
ISSUES OR JUST MAKE A COUPLE

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:01.239
BRIEF POINTS. FOR STAYS WE

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:02.274
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR MAY

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.242
REVISION PROPOSAL -- WERE

00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:05.577
CONCERNED THAT UNDER THE

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:07.312
ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL WHICH THE

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:08.413
FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS LESS

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.681
IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE BUDGET.

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:11.082
BY OUR CALCULATIONS THAT'S

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:12.417
NEARLY SIX HUNDRED FEWER

00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:14.920
POSITIONS AT DMV RIGHT BEFORE

00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:16.855
THE REAL ID DEADLINE IN OCTOBER

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:18.590
OF TWENTY TWENTY SO WE WANT TO

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:20.091
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FUNDING

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:21.092
SO THAT WAIT TIMES DO NOT.

00:24:21.159 --> 00:24:23.328
GO UP NEXT YEAR AND THAT

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:24.763
TRAINING IS NOT DELAYED.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.097
THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:27.399
IS AROUND AUGMENTATION AUTHORITY

00:24:27.465 --> 00:24:29.367
AGAIN WITH EVERYTHING COMING TO

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:31.336
A HEAD NEXT YEAR REGARDING REAL

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:33.405
ID IMPLEMENTATION -- WE BELIEVE

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:35.273
THAT THE JAIL BC AUGMENTATION

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.175
PROCESS IS THE RIGHT WAY IF IT

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:38.777
TURNS OUT THAT WE DO NEED WAS

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:39.811
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT.

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:42.948
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE DMV

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:44.216
THAT DOCKING OCCUR THROUGH THE

00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:45.383
JAIL BC PROCESS AND WE DO KNOW

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.152
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CONVENE

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:48.353
TOGETHER FOR ANOTHER BUDGET BILL

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.889
JUNIOR TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:51.790
AUGMENTATION CAN TAKE PLACE.

00:24:51.857 --> 00:24:53.658
AND THEN THIRD ON THE CREDIT

00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:55.493
CARD FEES -- WHILE WE APPRECIATE

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.596
THAT THIS ISSUE -- IT WOULD NOT

00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:58.997
UNLIKE THE ISSUES I WAS JUST

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:01.499
DISCUSSING A FACT -- ARE PLANNED

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:02.100
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN FOR

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.935
THE DMV IN THE UPCOMING YEAR IT

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:05.303
WOULD HAVE A DOWNSTREAM THE FACT

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:06.638
ON THAT SOLVENCY OF THE MOTOR

00:25:06.705 --> 00:25:08.607
VEHICLE ACCOUNT OR THE ABILITY

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:10.275
OF THAT ACCOUNT TO SUPPORT OTHER

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:11.109
CAPITAL.

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:12.711
PROJECTS WE DO BELIEVE THAT

00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:14.412
PASSING ON CREDIT CARD FEES IS

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:16.081
CONSISTENT WITH PRACTICES OF

00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:17.382
OTHER DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:19.284
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD SO WE DO

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.052
WANT TO STICK TO THAT PART OF

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.921
THE PROPOSAL -- AND SO WITH THAT

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:24.456
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS

00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:30.028
AROUND OUR PROPOSAL.

00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:31.730
THANK YOU QUESTIONS [inaudible]

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:33.565
WITH SKINNER [inaudible]

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:34.966
I'M.

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:37.168
THE CREDIT CARD FEE ISSUE WHILE.

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:40.639
OTHER DEPARTMENTS MAY DO IT.

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:44.276
I THINK WE HAVE A CLEARLY A A

00:25:44.342 --> 00:25:46.511
PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM IN

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:47.913
RELATIONSHIP [inaudible]

00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:50.115
TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND THE

00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:51.449
DMV.

00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:54.819
IN THAT -- AND IN SOME OF THIS

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:56.988
IS.

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:58.490
WAS NOT WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.458
MAKING IN OTHER WORDS THE FACT

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:02.627
THAT WE NOW HAVE TO DO THESE

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:04.029
REAL ID'S AND SUCH.

00:26:04.095 --> 00:26:05.463
AND WE KNOW THAT OTHER STATES

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.768
ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING -- BUT

00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:11.736
WAIT TIMES IN DELAYS BECAUSE OF

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:13.204
THIS NEW WORKLOAD.

00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:15.440
BUT EVEN PRIOR TO THEIR REAL

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:16.942
ID'S.

00:26:17.008 --> 00:26:20.545
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BEST -- IF WE

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:21.980
I THINK IF WE YOU FIVE VENTURE

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:23.915
TO SAY THAT IF WE DID A POLL AND

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:26.351
ASKED -- CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:28.653
WHAT WAS THEIR LEAST FAVORITE.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.889
STATE DEPARTMENT THEY MIGHT.

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:34.392
INDICATE TO DMV SO I THINK IT IS

00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:37.362
WELL WORTH OUR WHILE. TO IN IN

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:39.998
THE PLAN IN ANY PLAN THAT WE DO

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:41.333
TO IMPROVE THAT CUSTOMER

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:44.936
RELATIONS AND I THINK CHARGING.

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:47.339
FOR THE CREDIT CARD FEES IS A

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:49.207
BAD MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION.

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.909
AND FOR MOST OF US WE EVEN GO TO

00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:52.544
RETAIL FACILITIES THAT SAY

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.879
EITHER THEY THEY WON'T ACCEPT A

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:56.514
CREDIT CARD UNLESS IT'S UNDER

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:58.850
CERTAIN SALES FOR THRESHOLD OR

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.285
VARIOUS OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT

00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:03.555
YOU KNOW CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY.

00:27:03.621 --> 00:27:04.889
BUT BEYOND THAT.

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:07.759
WE DON'T CHARGE.

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:09.461
FOR PROCESSING OF A CHECK AND

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:11.329
I'M SURE IN THIS CASE WHAT WE

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:13.598
WOULD BE DOING IN ANYBODY YOU

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:14.232
DIDN'T WANT TO PAY THE CREDIT

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:16.468
CARD FEET IT WOULD MOST LIKELY

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:18.436
BE A CHECK WE'RE NOT.

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:20.372
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE PAYING CASH.

00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:23.675
SO CHECKS ARE QUITE COSTLY TO

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:26.044
HANDLE ALSO THEY REQUIRE A LOT

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:29.381
OF PERSONAL TIME TO PROCESS.

00:27:29.447 --> 00:27:31.049
AND THEN YOU CAN NEVER BAD

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.585
CHECKS SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE

00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:36.121
DEPARTMENT IS LOOKED AT WHETHER --

00:27:36.187 --> 00:27:37.856
I MEAN I ALWAYS FELT THAT WE

00:27:37.922 --> 00:27:39.324
WOULD PROBABLY BE STREAMLINING

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:43.194
AND CUTTING COSTS JUST BY REALLY.

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:44.796
INCREASING OUR ACCEPTANCE OF

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:46.931
CREDIT CARDS IN A WHOLE VARIETY

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:50.268
OF PAYMENTS -- SO.

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.736
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:53.972
LOOK AT THAT THROUGH THAT LENS

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:56.141
BECAUSE WHILE YES IT'S CLEAR

00:27:56.207 --> 00:27:57.876
THAT CREDIT CARDS -- COMPANIES

00:27:57.942 --> 00:28:00.812
CHARGE A PROCESSING FEE WE ALSO

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:03.214
HAVE A LOT OF COSTS JUST

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:05.250
EMBEDDED IN THE PROCESSING OF

00:28:05.316 --> 00:28:06.751
CHECKS.

00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:07.986
SO I I WOULD GO WITH THE

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:10.021
SENATE'S VERSION OF REJECTING

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:12.824
THE PASSING ON OF THE CREDIT

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.959
CARD FEES.

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:16.928
THANK YOU ARTHUR MORE LUCK FALL

00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:18.997
BY SENATOR NIELSEN THE MANAGER

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:19.731
AT HAVING BEEN.

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:20.298
TREASURER FOR THE COUNTY OF

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:20.865
ORANGE FOR TWELVE YEARS AND

00:28:20.932 --> 00:28:23.535
HAVING. TO PUT UP WITH THIS

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:24.769
CONVENIENCE FEE WE ARE WHEN IT

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:27.472
CAME TO PAYING PROPERTY TAXES.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:28.239
BUT OF PEOPLE WANTED TO USE

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:31.176
THEIR CREDIT CARD TO GET MILEAGE

00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:34.779
BUT SOME.

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.748
BUT BRED TO IS THERE FOR THE IT

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:36.948
ISN'T.

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:41.119
AS IF -- THERE IS -- CHECKS ARE

00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:42.854
CHEAPER OR WHATEVER IT'S IT'S

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:45.657
IT'S IT'S VISA CHARGING A

00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:47.325
CONVENIENCE FEE AT ALL LIKE A

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:48.726
223%.

00:28:48.793 --> 00:28:49.894
AND AND THEY DO NOT HAVE A

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:51.830
GOVERNMENT RATE.

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:53.431
SO LIKE A REDUCED RATE FOR FOR

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:55.100
THOSE OF US THAT ARE.

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:57.969
COLLECTING FUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS --

00:28:58.036 --> 00:28:59.971
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT COMPETING WITH

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:01.406
OTHER RETAIL STORES TECH.

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:03.975
COME INTO OUR OUR STORES WHICH

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:05.877
IS WHERE CREDIT CARDS STARTED IN

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:06.911
THE FIRST PLACE SO.

00:29:06.978 --> 00:29:08.313
I RECEIVED WE NEED TO DO A

00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:09.581
LITTLE WORK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.082
BEFORE ABOUT GETTING BE SAID TO

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:12.484
BE A LITTLE MORE --

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.952
ACCOMMODATING TO GOVERNMENT

00:29:14.018 --> 00:29:15.787
ACCOUNTS -- I THINK DISCOVER

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:16.955
CARD IS THE ONLY ONE THAT

00:29:17.021 --> 00:29:18.990
DOESN'T CHARGE A FEE BUT THEN

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:21.759
YOU HAVE TO BRING IT IN PERSON

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:23.495
YOU CAN'T JUST DO IT OVER ONLINE.

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:25.163
SO THE THE ARE THE OPTIONS YOU

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.865
HAVE HEARD MAYBE TO TO CHARGE TO

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:27.966
FEES.

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:29.734
ONE FOR THOSE A PAY CHECK OR

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:31.436
CASH IN AND SO LET'S SAY THAT'S

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:32.470
TWENTY DOLLARS AND THEN THOSE

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:35.006
THAT PAY WITH CREDIT CARD THAT'S

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:37.609
TWENTY TWO OR YOU DO A BLENDED-RATE YOU SAY LET'S JUST CHARGE

00:29:37.675 --> 00:29:39.177
EVERYBODY TWENTY ONE SO WHAT.

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:40.111
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE COME

00:29:40.178 --> 00:29:41.813
OUT EVEN BUT NOW YOU'RE

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.847
PENALIZING THOSE THAT ARE

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:47.352
WRITING CHECKS OR PAYING CASH --

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:49.220
BUT BUT I I I I I I WOULD ARGUE

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.523
AGAINST.

00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:52.924
PAYING THE THE THE THE CREDIT

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:56.427
CARD FEE -- AND IN TWO BECAUSE

00:29:56.494 --> 00:29:57.395
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ADDED ON

00:29:57.462 --> 00:30:00.031
AS AN EXTRA FOR CREDIT CARDS AND

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:02.033
SO I WOULD TAKE THE OPPOSITE.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.468
POSITION TO HAVE A LITTLE DEBATE

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:04.669
THANK YOU MADAM.

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:07.705
THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN.

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:09.174
WELL I WOULD CONCUR ON THE

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.942
CREDIT CARD ISSUE I DO BELIEVE

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:12.010
THAT THAT IS A LITTLE BIT

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:14.546
PROBLEMATIC AND I THINK IT WOULD

00:30:14.612 --> 00:30:15.880
ADD TO THE AGGRAVATION.

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:18.516
FILL THE MOTORING PUBLIC.

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:21.886
AND IN TERMS OF THE ONE YEAR

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:23.721
FUNDING AS OPPOSED TO A LONGER

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:26.257
TERM FUNDING.

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:27.725
EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:29.761
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO

00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:33.198
KEEP THE DMV ON A SHORTEST LEASH

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:35.733
I THINK IS REQUIRED.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.036
THE EARLY VIOLATED THE TRUST OF

00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:40.238
THE LEGISLATURE UNDER THE PEOPLE.

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:42.740
AND I'M NOT FOR GIVING THEM MUCH

00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:44.709
MORE LATITUDE.

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:45.977
I'M RATHER TO GIVE THEM A

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:49.347
SHORTER LEASH WHERE WE CAN HAVE-MORE CONTROL.

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:50.748
AND QUICKER QUICK THE MORE

00:30:50.815 --> 00:30:52.817
QUICKLY EXERCISE THAT CONTROL

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:54.586
OVER DMV.

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.621
SO THE LONGER TERM FUNDING IS

00:30:56.688 --> 00:31:02.360
NOT SUITABLE TO ME.

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:04.095
I WOULD MISTER KING.

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:07.232
NO FOR IT.

00:31:07.298 --> 00:31:08.433
I WAS GONNA GO SENATOR NIELSEN

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:11.769
SOUND COMMENTS WE HEARD --

00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:12.971
THROUGH A SIGNIFICANT A

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:14.205
TESTIMONY OF LAST YEAR.

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:15.640
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT DMV

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:16.541
WAS GOING TO DO.

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:18.876
I CAN'T PROMISE AFTER PROMISE

00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:19.677
AFTER PROMISE BUT THEY DID DO

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:20.612
WAS.

00:31:20.678 --> 00:31:23.047
HIRE PEOPLE BUT THEY DIDN'T DO

00:31:23.114 --> 00:31:24.182
IS TRAIN THEM.

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:25.883
SO THEY COULDN'T GET THE FULL.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.585
SKILL OUT OF THEM BY NOT

00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:28.419
TRAINING THEM THEY COULDN'T WORK

00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:29.954
BEHIND THE DESK CAN USE

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:31.289
COMPUTERS DIDN'T REALLY KNOW.

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:34.492
WHAT FORMS WERE USED BY THE

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.094
DEPARTMENT REALLY HOW?

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:36.861
TO HOW TO HELP THE CUSTOMERS WHO

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.096
WERE STANDING IN.

00:31:38.162 --> 00:31:40.164
FAIRLY LONG LINES YOU KNOW I HAD

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:41.299
CUSTOMERS IN IN MY AREA THAT

00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:43.201
THEY WOULD LINE UP AT FIVE

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:44.402
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:46.104
WE NEED TO GET IN DIEM BE AT

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.740
NINE O'CLOCK -- SO OF COURSE TO

00:31:48.806 --> 00:31:49.741
WAIT TIMES THANKS TO LOOK LIKE --

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:52.043
THAT CUSTOMER ONLY WAITED TEN

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.644
MINUTES BECAUSE THEY GOT THEIR

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:53.077
FINE IN [inaudible]

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.412
THAT.

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:55.546
YOU KNOW THAT REALLY SHOULD BE

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.649
AN EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE FOR

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.217
PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO DO --

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:04.155
THE BASIC WORK AT THE DMV.

00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:06.858
WE ALSO GIVE MONIES FOR WIFI WE

00:32:06.924 --> 00:32:08.293
GAVE MONEY FOR TABLETS AND WHAT

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:09.327
WE FOUND IS.

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:10.628
THE MONEY THAT'S GIVEN WIFI

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:13.298
THERE'S ONLY BEEN. ONE ONE AS OF

00:32:13.364 --> 00:32:15.400
THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY A FEW

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:16.801
MONTHS AGO ONLY.

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:18.970
ONE OFFICE ACTUALLY HAD EXTERNAL

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:22.507
WIFI -- TABLETS WERE PURCHASED

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:24.008
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EXTERNAL

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:26.210
WIFI THE TABLETS CAN BE USED.

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:29.614
SO WHAT WE HAVE IS HERE IS OUR

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:31.316
LOT OF PROMISES AND NOT A LOT OF

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:31.983
THE LIVER [inaudible]

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:36.054
AND HILL WE EVEN HAD AN ACTING

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.522
DIRECTOR COME IN FRONT OF BUDGET

00:32:37.588 --> 00:32:38.723
SUB.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.927
SIX TALK ABOUT -- ALL THE THINGS

00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:43.628
THE DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO DO.

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:45.363
THAT ALL THE DEPUTIES WERE THERE

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.197
WHEN THE PREVIOUS DIRECTOR START

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.700
SAYING ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.601
SHE WAS GOING TO DO.

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:51.235
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE IS.

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:53.905
A SENSE THAT ANYBODY WAS REALLY.

00:32:53.971 --> 00:32:56.541
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT.

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:58.009
THEY SAID.

00:32:58.076 --> 00:32:59.911
THERE WAS A COMPLETE LACK OF

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:01.612
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:04.248
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE'LL ALL

00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:06.184
OUR PHONES LIGHT I MEAN YOU WANT

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:06.818
TO KNOW WHO'S COUNSELED PEOPLE

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:07.051
APPEAR.

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:09.420
ON THE DíAS BECAUSE OUR PHONES

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:11.155
RING.

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:12.223
CALL US I KNOW.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.224
THAT -- DMV'S PROBABLY ONE OF

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:15.193
OUR TOP FIVE OR TEN ISSUES THAT

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:16.394
WE HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS OR

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:18.229
THE CAN CAN APPOINTMENT THEIR

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.965
ID'S ARE EXPIRING THEY THE GUEST

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:22.100
AND APPOINTMENTS TO THE PLACES

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.167
THAT ARE YOU KNOW.

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:25.636
VERY FAR FROM HOME.

00:33:25.703 --> 00:33:27.138
SO AGAIN.

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:28.973
WITH OUR APPROACH WITH THIS.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.476
APPROPRIATION WAS REALLY TO WE

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:32.844
CAN ENSURE THAT.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.246
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HIRED OR

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:37.115
IN THE PROCESS OF BEING HIRED.

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.050
WERE ON GETTING THE PROBE

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:39.851
GETTING THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:42.186
OF FUNDING AND THEN WITH HOLDING.

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:44.322
THE ADDITIONAL MONEY WHICH AGAIN

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:47.291
WAS ONLY -- ONLY FORTY MILLION

00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:48.693
DOLLARS AND AND AGAIN LET LET'S

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.260
JUST LET'S JUST PUT THIS IN

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:50.194
CONTEXT.

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:52.363
DMV BUDGET IS A BILLION DOLLARS.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:56.167
SUITE TWO HUNDRED MILLION.

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:57.301
DOLLAR AUGMENTATION EVEN A PART

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:58.936
OF IT IS ONE TIME IS A 20%

00:33:59.003 --> 00:34:00.738
AUGMENTATION.

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:02.340
SO IT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:04.809
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES IT'S A HUGE

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.978
AMOUNT OF RESOURCE.

00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:08.813
AND KNOWING THE CRUSH THAT'S

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.148
GONNA COM.

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:11.215
WITH RELY DE I THINK THE IDEA

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:13.618
WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:15.253
WE LET DIEM VIA.

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:16.654
HI THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HIGHER.

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.322
MAKE SURE THEY'RE GONNA TRAIN

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.557
THOSE PEOPLE THAT ALL THOSE

00:34:19.624 --> 00:34:20.758
PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO BE TRAINED.

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:21.926
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:23.528
NEED MORE MONEY I DON'T THINK

00:34:23.594 --> 00:34:24.762
THERE'S ANYBODY HERE SAYING.

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:26.330
DON'T COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE

00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:28.232
EVEN MID YEAR FOR A MAJOR

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:30.001
AUGMENTATION BECAUSE WE NEED IT.

00:34:30.067 --> 00:34:32.170
BECAUSE AT THE END OF DAYS WE

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:34.639
DON'T WANT YOU TO GO BY AND FOR

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:36.507
THE LINES TO CONTINUE FOR THE

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:38.075
LACK OF DELIVERY AND FOR THE

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:40.611
INABILITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:41.679
DO SOMETHING.

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:44.081
AT THIS POINT WE WE HAVE THE

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.583
SAME HEARING HE WAS LIKE

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:46.284
GROUNDHOG DAY.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.286
LAST YEAR IN AUGUST AND WE HAVE

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:51.022
THE EXACT SAME HEARING WE HAD IN

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:51.889
APRIL.

00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:52.990
NO DIFFERENCE IF THEY TOOK THE

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:53.991
ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS.

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:56.160
THAT AGGRAVATION OF OUR

00:34:56.227 --> 00:35:01.065
CONSTITUENTS WAS NO LESS.

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:01.632
AND THE STAKES ARE GETTING

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:02.200
HIGHER BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.701
CLOSER AND CLOSER TO OUR REAL ID

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:04.635
OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE.

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:08.473
SO AGAIN -- I PERSONALLY DIDN'T

00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:11.142
FEEL THAT THERE WAS A

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:12.777
ACCOUNTABILITY AND ON THE PATH

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.011
DEPARTMENT ARE.

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:14.545
REALLY ON BEHALF OF THE

00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:15.947
LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT SO

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.548
I THINK FOR ME IT'S MAKING SURE.

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:18.783
THAT.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:19.917
THE LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDING IS

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:22.053
PROPER OVERSIGHT WITHOUT TWO

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:23.488
HUNDRED AGAIN A 20% AUGMENTATION

00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:25.156
I WOULD NOT.

00:35:25.223 --> 00:35:27.024
I WOULD THINK SHOULD BE PLENTY

00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:30.261
AND WITHHOLDING THE 40% FOR

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:31.696
AGAIN YOU CAN COME BACK EVEN

00:35:31.762 --> 00:35:32.864
BEFORE I TO SESSION BEFORE

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.332
SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH.

00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:35.733
AND HAVE THAT DISCUSSION TO HAVE

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.634
THAT VOTED ON BUT AGAIN I THINK

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:37.869
IT MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO

00:35:37.935 --> 00:35:40.137
WITHHOLD THAT -- FORTY MILLION

00:35:40.204 --> 00:35:42.940
DOLLARS BEFORE MONEY WAS FURTHER

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.542
MISSPENT SO AGAIN IN THE IN THE

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:47.712
CASE OF THE TABLETS OF THE WIFI

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:48.913
THE MONEY WAS SPENT.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.716
THE RESOURCES JUST ONE USE.

00:35:51.782 --> 00:35:52.316
SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S EVEN

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:53.651
WORSE TO FEEL LIKE TO TAXPAYERS

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:53.918
MONEY WAS.

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.987
WASTED ON THINGS THAT THE

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:59.056
DEPARTMENT DID NOT END UP USING.

00:35:59.123 --> 00:36:00.157
THANK YOU I THINK THAT I WOULD

00:36:00.224 --> 00:36:01.659
SAY THAT I I THINK -- IT'S

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:02.927
IMPORTANT FOR US IS THE

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:04.529
LEGISLATURE TO REALLY BE CLEAR

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:06.931
ABOUT OUR ROLE OF OVERSIGHT IN A

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:08.466
PROPER LEVEL OVERSIGHT.

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:09.901
VERSES A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:11.936
DIRECTORS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.137
MOTOR VEHICES -- WE HAVE A

00:36:13.204 --> 00:36:14.839
CLEAR ROLE TO PLAY AND YOU HAVE

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:15.740
A CLEAR ROLE TO PLAY AS

00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:18.342
ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS YOUR

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:19.677
DEPARTMENT HEADS.

00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:21.479
ON A AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:22.380
CONTINUE TO HAVE THE

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:24.148
CONVERSATION BECAUSE AS I SAID

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:27.285
SAID PREVIOUSLY -- IT IS IN OUR

00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:29.387
COLLECTIVE BEST INTEREST TO MAKE

00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:30.788
SURE TO THE DMV IS A FUNCTION

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:32.890
STATE DEPARTMENT IN THAT NEARLY

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:34.659
EVERY LIFE IN CALIFORNIA'S

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:36.093
TOUCHED BY THIS ONE DEPARTMENT.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.328
AND SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:40.231
CONTINUE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT US

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:43.301
NEEDING TO BE PARTNERS IN THAT.

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:44.936
I HAD A QUESTION -- IN LOOKING

00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:47.872
AT THE SIMPLEST PROPOSAL -- AND

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:51.208
ASKING THAT -- ANY ADDITIONAL

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:52.543
FUNDING.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:57.148
REQUEST TO BE BROUGHT BACK -- TO

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:58.783
THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE AS

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:01.519
OPPOSED TO UTILIZING THE

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:03.588
EXISTING -- G. L. B. C. PROCESS

00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:05.389
I GUESS MY CONCERN WITH THAT

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.458
WOULD REALLY BE TIMING WE HAVE A

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:08.759
PROCESS BY WHICH MADE YOUR

00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:10.628
ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE MADE EITHER

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:12.129
THROUGH GOP CITY WHICH IS

00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:13.764
TYPICALLY UTILIZED WHEN WE ARE

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:15.066
OUT OF SESSION THAT'SBEEN MY

00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:16.267
EXPERIENCE.

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:17.802
THE LAST THREE YEARS THE GOP SEE

00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:20.438
CHAIR -- SPRING FINANCE LETTERS

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:22.006
WHICH ARE IN SPRING -- OR

00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:24.108
THROUGH BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS

00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:25.810
YOU KNOW IT IF THE ASSEMBLY

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:28.212
ACTION WERE TAKEN -- WHAT?

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:31.415
YOU CAN DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:33.417
TIMING WHEN THESE.

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:34.452
ADJUSTMENTS MIGHT BE MADE DO YOU

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:35.553
THINK WOULD YOU HAVE CONCERN OF

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.687
THE ASSEMBLY -- ACTION WE'RE

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:39.590
TAKING THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE --

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:40.658
YOU WOULDN'T GET THE RESOURCES

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:42.293
YOU NEED IN A TIMELY MATTER FOR

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.695
EXAMPLE IF IT'S DURING OUR

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:46.697
LEGISLATIVE RECESS.

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:47.665
ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN TURN

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:49.533
IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SO FOR

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.271
THE D. -- ADMINISTRATION IN A AS

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:55.573
IF YOU'RE A VICE CHAIR TING SAID.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.540
WE UNDERSTAND THE LEVEL OF

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:57.608
FRUSTRATION HERE WE UNDERSTAND

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.710
THAT IT'S BUILDING OVER A NUMBER

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:00.911
OF NOT JUST MONTHS BUT YEARS.

00:38:00.978 --> 00:38:02.680
AHEAD AS YOU NOTED MADAM CHAIR

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.982
WE SHARE THAT CONCERN THAT WE

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:06.550
ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:08.119
PROBLEM AND THE GOVERNOR FEELS

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:09.453
THAT VERY DIRECTLY AS TO THE TOP

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.621
MEMBERS OF HIS.

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.356
ADMINISTRATION SO A LOT OF

00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:14.091
THOUGHT WENT INTO THIS PROPOSAL

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:15.893
AND THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT WE

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.795
PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IS

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.830
WHAT WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY TO

00:38:19.897 --> 00:38:20.765
MEET THE NEEDS SO.

00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:22.967
AT THIS POINT IT'S HARD FOR THE

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.435
ADMINISTRATION TO PROJECT WHAT

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:26.837
EXTRA RESOURCES WE MIGHT NEED

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:28.606
BECAUSE ALL OF THAT -- ALL THAT

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:30.574
REASONING WENT INTO THE EXISTING

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:31.075
LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THE

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:31.976
PROPOSAL.

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.779
AND WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT.

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:36.947
LEGISLATURE MAY BE IN SESSION WE

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:37.581
MAY BE ABLE TO GET THE BUDGET

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:39.383
BILL JUNIOR VERY QUICKLY IF WE

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.818
DO NEED EXISTING RESOURCES.

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:42.953
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE DEPENDING ON

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:43.754
THE TIME OF YEAR.

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.089
THAT THAT QUICK PROCESS MIGHT

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:46.524
NOT BE AVAILABLE PARTICULARLY IN

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.125
A TIME FRAME THAT WE WOULD BE

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:49.694
HOPING FOR THE DMV TO CONTINUE

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.662
READING UP FOR THE PEAK OF REAL

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:52.730
ID IMPLEMENTATION.

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:54.365
NEXT SUMMER THE OTHER POINT THAT

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:56.000
I WANT TO MAKE IS -- DEPENDING

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:57.802
ON HOW LONG THAT PROCESS TAKES

00:38:57.868 --> 00:38:59.437
IT'S NOT SIMPLY THAT POSITIONS

00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:01.639
THEMSELVES BUT THE DOWNSTREAM

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:03.674
EFFECTS ON TRAINING AND HIRING

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.176
PEOPLE TO FILL THE NEXT SET OF

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:05.576
POSITIONS.

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:07.411
SO WE DO SHARE THAT CONCERN

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:12.750
WAITING UP TO NEXT OCTOBER AND A

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:13.317
BRIEF WE TURN IT OVER TO MY

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:15.820
COLLEAGUE.

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.555
BERNARD MARTIN FINANCE HERE THEN

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:19.256
I WOULD JUST -- NOTED THAT --

00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:22.426
THE TO THE JAIL BC PROCESS IN

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:24.462
THE CURRENT YEAR.

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:25.496
THE DMV WAS.

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:27.231
GIVEN FUNDING TO HIRE AT A

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.766
HIGHER UP THREE HUNDRED OF THE

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:30.267
POSITIONS OR BEING REQUESTED.

00:39:30.334 --> 00:39:32.837
AND WE JUST -- AT AS OF TODAY I

00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:34.305
THINK THE DMV HAD MADE -- TWO

00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:35.673
HUNDRED OFFERS ALREADY AND THE

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.707
FIRST MONTH AND THEY STILL HAVE

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:38.109
ANOTHER MONTHS AGO -- AND OF

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:39.243
THOSE A NINETY HAVE INDIVIDUALS

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.745
HAVE ALREADY BEGUN WORKING.

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:42.780
AND SO WE'RE KIND OF AS AS WE

00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:43.414
APPROACH THE REAL ID DEADLINE.

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:45.316
WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS RAMP UP

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:47.151
AND IT INVOLVES THE OBVIOUSLY

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:49.253
THE RECRUITMENT AND THEN.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.554
THE HIRING AND THEN THE

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:51.889
COMBINATION OF GETTING THEM IN

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:53.390
OFFICE EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING

00:39:53.457 --> 00:39:59.196
AND SO -- WITHOUT THESE FUNDS I

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:00.898
THINK WE THEY COULD CONTINUE AT

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:01.866
THE CURRENT RATE OF HIRING

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:03.601
THROUGH -- MAYBE THE END OF JULY

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:04.735
AND SO IF IF WE WERE TO TO NEED

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:06.203
TO COME BACK FOR FUNDING.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.804
I COULD EASILY ENVISION THAT

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:08.372
BEING YOU KNOW AS EARLY AS

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:10.040
AUGUST.

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:11.342
AND I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE AS AS

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.978
THE VICE CHAIR HAS REMINDED US

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:15.646
OF THE TRAINING FALL POP IN THE

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:17.348
PAST I CERTAINLY HOPE OF TWO

00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:18.983
HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE BEING ON

00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:21.318
IN A COMPREHENSIVE FULL COMPLETE

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:22.553
KIND OF WAY.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.321
THE OTHER PIECE I WOULD RAISE IS

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:26.524
JUST THE THAT THE AREA THAT THE

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.225
SENT ME SOME WE DO SUPPORT WHICH

00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:29.627
IS THE REQUIREMENT OF MONTHLY

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:30.761
REPORTING.

00:40:30.828 --> 00:40:31.862
ON AND I KNOW THAT A GREAT DEAL

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:33.397
OF WORK IS BEING PUT INTO REALLY

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:36.734
FIGURING OUT PERFORMANCE METRICS --

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:37.835
THAT ARE RELEVANT.

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.470
I FOR ONE WOULD NOT BE

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:42.039
INTERESTED IN CREATING -- KIND

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.175
OF A RONI IS MONTHLY REPORTS FOR

00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:46.243

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.812
MEASURING THE RIGHT THING AND

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:49.480
GET US NOWHERE AND PULL --

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:51.782
PERSONNEL AWAY FROM.

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:53.717
FRONTLINE PROBLEM SOLVING AND

00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:54.752
SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:56.120
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN A

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:58.422
CONVERSATION OF AND AND COME TO

00:40:58.489 --> 00:40:59.790
SOME AGREEMENT ON WHAT THOSE

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:02.359
PERFORMANCE METRICS PERFORMANCE

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:04.695
METRICS SHOULD BE -- TO QUELL

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:06.831
THE UNREST AMONG THE LEGISLATURE

00:41:06.897 --> 00:41:09.033
SIDE SO WE ARE IN A POSITION OF

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:11.836

00:41:11.902 --> 00:41:14.939
OVERSIGHT ROLE -- AND THAT YOU

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:32.456
CHALLENGE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:33.290
THOSE ARE MERE SYMPTOMS OF

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.692
STRUCTURAL ISSUES IS THE ONE TO

00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:25.682
ISSUES.

00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:27.284
AND TRENDS -- THAT THE

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:30.220
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER AS

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:30.787

THIS IS IN PART OF OUR CURRENT

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:41.532
NAY REVISION PLAN AND SHOULD

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:44.334
ISSUES NOT SPECIFICALLY -- ON

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:46.136
THE CONFERENCE AGENDA THAT THE

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:48.338
SUPPORT THE CREATION OF THE

ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED FUNDING.

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:53.710
AND ON THE SECOND ISSUE THAT LA --

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:55.179
MENTIONED WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:56.647
TYPE OF REPORTING ROLE IS BEST

00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:59.216
SITUATED WITHIN THE EXISTING

00:46:59.283 --> 00:47:02.152

RELEASE SUCH A REPORT THE

00:47:03.253 --> 00:47:04.087

HEALTH RELEASE SUCH REPORT THIS

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:07.291
YEAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT'S

00:47:07.357 --> 00:47:08.759
CORRECT RIGHT AND SOLD LA L. IS

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.127
IT YOUR SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:11.862
MORE APPROPRIATE TO COME FROM.

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:13.864
THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:15.599
GENERAL WHO.

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:16.767
I SHOULD WILL FAIL AN ASIDE

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:19.236
STATUTORILY DOESN'T EXIST IT WAS

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:20.704
CREATED TO EXECUTIVE ORDERS I

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:22.039
THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE ABOUT

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:23.407
WHEN THAT'S GOING TO BE RESOLVED

00:47:23.473 --> 00:47:23.974

FINANCE ON THAT.

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:27.411
BUT WAS IT YOUR POINT WE WE

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:28.445
ACTUALLY ARE NOT TAKING A

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:30.147
POSITION ON WHETHER IT'S HOUSED

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:31.615
IN OFFICES SURGEON GENERAL OR

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:34.585
I WOULD JUST REMIND MEMBERS THAT

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:36.820
THE REASON THE DEPARTMENT DID

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:38.222
PRESENT SUCH A REPORT.

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:39.356
AT THE BEGINNING A BUDGET

THE BUDGET.

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:45.963
OF FROM LAST YEAR AND SO IF IT

00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:47.364
IS HOUSED IN THE OFFICE OF THE

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.700
SURGEON GENERAL -- THE POSITION

00:47:49.766 --> 00:47:51.201
THE TWO STAFF MEMBERS THAT WOULD

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:53.403
BE AUTHORIZED BY THIS

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.504
APPROPRIATION WOULD MORE.

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:56.006
A MOST LIKELY BE WORKING VERY

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.507
CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:47:57.574 --> 00:48:01.111

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.084
OF THE THINGS THAT IS WAS

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.487
CONSIDERED AND PUTTING FOR THE

THE BUDGET -- FOR A THE FISCAL

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:14.191
IMPACT OF THAT ACTION WOULD HAVE

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:15.859
TAKEN WAS THE FACT THAT PUBLIC

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:16.927
HEALTH CAN LEVERAGES SOME OF ITS

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:18.528
EXISTING RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO

DEVELOP THIS REPORT WHICH IS ONE

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:21.198
OF THE REASONS WHY WE ALSO THINK

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.599
IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE ON THE

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.368

VIOLENCE PREVENTION INITIATIVE

00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:35.145
WHICH WE BELIEVE I HAVE SOME

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:36.513
DUPLICATE OF WORK IN THAT SPACE

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.514
AS WELL SO WE BELIEVE PUBLIC

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:39.783
HEALTH WOULD BE THE MORE

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:40.083
APPROPRIATE.

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.300
EXPECTATIONS ALL THINGS THAT

00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:58.035
STATUTE CURRENTLY REFLECTS FOR

00:48:58.101 --> 00:48:58.535
OTHER.

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:00.237

CALLED THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.812
IS THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:16.479
TRYING TO CONTAIN COSTS WITH OUR

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:43.473
IF IF WE WERE TO IMPLEMENT THE

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.208

BE UNCERTAINTY AND WHETHER THIS

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:11.334
JUST GOING TO BE AN ADDRESS STEP

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:12.969

THESE OPTIONS OVERALL INCLUDED

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:17.746

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:33.662
BILLION DOLLARS AND ALSO.

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:35.197
LEFT THE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:36.732
INDUSTRY BETTER OFF THAN IT

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.367
WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE OTHER

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:39.635
OPTIONS.

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:46.609
TURNING TO PAGE -- FIVE HERE

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:47.676

TAX PACKAGES OF THE GOVERNOR AS

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:49.745
WELL AS THE TWO HOUSES.

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:50.813
THE GOVERNOR AS YOU ALL KNOW DID

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:53.115
NOT PROPOSE AN EXTENSION OF THAT --

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:55.317
MCO TAX PACKAGE THE THEIR BY FOR

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.252

MORE BILLION DOLLAR NET GENERAL

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:00.723

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.524
THE SENATE APPROVED A THREE YEAR

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:07.262
WITH THE MODIFIED RATES

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:09.164
GENERATING IN THAT GENERAL FUND

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:11.567
BENEFIT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OF

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:13.102
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS.

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:14.637

WITH THE MODIFIED RATES.

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:23.112
AND THIS ALSO WAS THE PACKAGE

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:24.546
THAT WOULD GENERATE THE NET

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.081
GENERAL OF THE BENEFIT OF ONE

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:28.517
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS.

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.452
SO ULTIMATELY THE SENATE AND

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:32.421
ASSEMBLY BOTH ADOPTED REALLY THE

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:37.259
SAME MCO TAX PACKAGE -- THE ONE

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.661
THAT GENERATES THE GREATEST NET

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.963
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT AND THE ONE

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.599
THAT REDUCES -- OR GENERATES

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.501
ALSO THE GREATEST FISCAL BENEFIT

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:46.402
FOR THE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.470
INDUSTRY AND THAT WE HAD THAT WE

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:50.873
HAD MODELED AT THAT TIME -- IF

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:53.275
YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX WE HAVE A

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:54.510
WE HAVE A FIGURE THAT REALLY

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.745
SUMMARIZES THAT MODEL I WON'T GO

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.213
INTO ALL THE DETAILS.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.948
OF THAT BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:01.950
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THAT

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:03.552
STRUCTURED AND HOW IT IT

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:05.888
IMPROVES.

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:07.690
THE OVERALL OUTCOMES.

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:09.925
THE FIGURE -- THEN THE FIGURE ON

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:12.494
PAGE SEVEN SUMMARIZES LE THOSE

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:14.229
DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF THE NET

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:15.731
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT AS WELL AS

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.299
THE NET FISCAL BENEFIT FOR THE

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:19.468
HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY SO YOU

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.203
SEE THAT THE THE NET GENERAL

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.371
FUND BENEFIT WOULD INCREASE BY

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:23.839
ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:26.275
DOLLARS UNDER THE THE MODEL.

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:28.711
THAT WAS ADOPTED BY BOTH HOUSES.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:31.080
AND THAT THE NET FISCAL BENEFIT

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:32.381
FOR THE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:34.850
INDUSTRY WOULD INCREASE FROM OF

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.318
FIVE OR CLOSE TO ZERO BECAUSE

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:37.820
THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.621
THERE TO THAT CLOSER TO NINETY

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:40.723
THREE YEAR CLOSE TO A HUNDRED

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:42.791
MILLION DOLLARS. TO SUMMARIZE

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:45.828
THE DIFFERENCES.

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.129
BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:47.730
THE MADE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:49.832
DIFFERENCES IN THAT TIME PERIOD

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:52.134
FOR WHICH THE HOUSES WOULD RE

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.535
AUTHORIZE THE TAX THE SENATE RE

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:55.304
AUTHORIZED FOR THREE YEAR PERIOD

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.072
AND THE ASSEMBLY RE AUTHORIZE

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:59.007
THEM CO TAX PACKAGE FOR A FOUR

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.175
YEAR PERIOD.

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:01.477
THE REMAINING DIFFERENCES REALLY

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:03.746
REFLECTED TECHNICAL DIFFERENCE

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:06.048
IN TERMS OF NGUYEN SAVINGS FROM

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:07.249
THE TAX OR WHEN THE NET GENERAL

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:09.184
FUND BENEFIT IS REALLY --

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:12.221
MATERIALIZING WITHIN HOW WEAK

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:12.955
ACCOUNT.

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.923
FOR ACCOUNT FOR THE ULTIMATE

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.725
SAVINGS THE SENATE APPROVED A

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:18.627
PACKAGE WHERE BY THE STATE MORE

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:20.329
SAVINGS WOULD MATERIALIZE IN THE

01:13:20.395 --> 01:13:22.664
BUDGET YEAR -- WHEREAS THE

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:24.366
ASSEMBLY SUPPORT A PACKAGE WHERE

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.568
A SOMEWHAT LESSER SAVINGS WOULD

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:28.470
MATERIALIZE ADDITIONALLY IN THE

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:30.205
BUDGET YEAR I'D NOTE THAT ANY

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:30.973
SAVINGS THAT DON'T INITIATIVE

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:33.075
THAT DON'T MATERIALIZE IN THAT

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:34.777
BUDGET YEAR WOULD ULTIMATELY

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:35.778
BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.212
SUBSEQUENT YEARS SO THIS IS

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:38.514
REALLY A TECHNICAL DIFFERENCE.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.183
AS TO THE TIMING OF WHEN THE

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.118
SAVINGS ARE THE NET GENERAL FUND

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:44.553
BENEFIT WOULD MATERIALIZE.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.289
TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT WE PROVIDE

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:50.459
A A MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK ON WHILE

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.327
WINDOWS SAVINGS WOULD OR THE NET

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:53.595
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT WOULD

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:54.797
MATERIALIZE.

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:56.465
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S A

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:58.333
DIFFERENCE BOTH IN TERMS OF THE

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.803
FIRST YEAR -- HOW MUCH THE HOW

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:02.504
MUCH SAVINGS WOULD BE AVAILABLE

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:05.507
AND THEN ALSO IN THE LAST YEAR

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:07.442
AND THAT'S PRIMARILY REFLECTING

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:08.811
THE LONGER TIME PERIOD RE

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:11.013
AUTHORIZATION UNDER THE

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.347
ASSEMBLIES PACKAGE?

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:13.582
OF THOUGH RIGHT MOST COLUMN JESS

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.184
IS THERE TO INDICATE THAT FOR

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.451
ALL THE YEARS OF THE TAX WOULD

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:18.520
BE RE AUTHORIZED THE AVERAGE NET

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:23.625
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT IS

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:26.028
IDENTICAL BETWEEN THE HOUSES.

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:27.429
NEXT JUST TURNED TO A A FEW LA

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:28.664
OF COMMENTS THAT WE SENT OVER TO

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:29.264
STAFF -- THERE ARE SOME KEY

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:30.165
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS THAT

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.000
REMAIN OUTSTANDING -- FOR

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:34.069
EXAMPLE -- WE HAVEN'T

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.071
ESTABLISHED OUT YOUR TAX RATES

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.506
THAT WE WOULD WANT TO APPLY AND

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:39.508
IF WE WANT TO MAINTAIN -- THE

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:42.077
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR --

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.378
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT YOU'D

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:44.413
PROBABLY WANT TO INCREASE THOSE

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:46.281
TAX RATES MARGINALLY ON A YEAR

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:49.484
OVER YEAR BASIS -- ALSO WE DON'T

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:50.519
HAVE A WE DON'T HAVE A

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:52.287
RECOMMENDATION ON WHICH IS THE

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:54.156
MOST -- TECHNICALLY ACCURATE

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.691
REFLECTION OF WHAT SAVINGS OR

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:57.759
BENEFIT WOULD MATERIALIZE IN THE

01:14:57.826 --> 01:14:59.761
BUDGET YEAR AND WE REALLY --

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.163
WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.464
LEGISLATURE ASKING

01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:03.832
ADMINISTRATION ON WHAT THE BEST

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:06.034
ASSUMPTIONS ARE -- FOR WHAT

01:15:06.101 --> 01:15:08.070
SAVINGS ARE MOST LIKELY TO

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:10.806
MATERIALIZE -- DURING DURING THE

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:13.008
BUDGET WINDOW SO WITH THAT HAPPY

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:16.511
TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM FROM

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:19.348
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.149
FROM FINANCE FIRST AND THEN

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:22.718
WE'LL OPEN UP TO COMMITTEE.

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:24.519
SAID THE NCO TAX HAS BEEN AN

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:26.288
IMPORTANT ELEMENT WITH ASSOCIATE

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.689
REVENUES UP FINANCING THE

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.024
STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.359
IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THAT

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:31.526
WAY IN THE FUTURE.

01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:33.095
HOWEVER GIVEN THE CURRENT

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:35.163
ENVIRONMENT -- WE KNOW THAT

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:36.999
APPROVAL OF AN EXTENSION OF THIS

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:39.534
TAX IS UNCERTAIN FOR THAT REASON

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:40.202
THE GOVERNOR AND THE

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:41.370
ADMINISTRATION.

01:15:41.436 --> 01:15:43.639
DO NOT SUPPORT INCLUDING ANY

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.140
ASSOCIATED REVENUES WERE

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:46.842
ALLOCATION OF THOSE REVENUES AS

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:48.543
PART OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS AND

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:49.778
FOR THAT SAME REASON THE BUDGET

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:51.380
THAT WE PUT FORWARD INTHE NAY

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:52.180
REVISION.

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:54.116
FUNDS THE GOVERNOR'S AT NEW

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:55.717
HEALTH CARE INITIATIVE PROPOSALS

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:57.486
WITHOUT RELYING ON MCO TAX

01:15:57.552 --> 01:15:58.487
REVENUE.

01:15:58.553 --> 01:15:59.755
THE GOVERNOR IN THE MINISTRATION

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:00.889
ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:02.557
THE LEGISLATURE LATER THIS

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:04.326
SESSION ON FIGURING OUT THE BEST

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.161
PATH FORWARD IN BUILDING THE

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:08.230
STRONGEST POSSIBLE CASE FOR AN

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:09.898
EXTENSION OF THE MTO TAX.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:10.933
THAT WILL MEET FEDERAL

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.534
GOVERNMENT APPROVAL BUT WE DO

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:16.038
NOT BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:18.173
PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.375
SENATOR MOORE Là FOLLOWED BY MR

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:21.977

MORE LAW THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

SPECIAL SESSION A FEW YEARS AGO

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:30.719
AND HAD THE JOY OF SERVING.

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:31.920
ON THAT AS WELL.

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:33.855
AND IT WAS A RUBIK'S CUBE TO

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.024
CONSTRUCT THE TAX STRUCTURE OF

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.793
OF AND SO ON PAGE SIX YOU KIND

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:39.594
HOW?

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:41.463
UNIQUE IT IS WHERE [inaudible]

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:44.232
WE'RE CHARGING.

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.335
NCOS WITH SMALLER ENROLLMENTS A

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.704
LOT MORE THAN WE ARE WITH THE

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.372
WITH LARGE ENROLLMENTS.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.441
IN SO I'M CURIOUS ABOUT A COUPLE

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:26.928
IT IS A BIT OF A A RUBIK'S CUBE

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:27.696
AND MEMBER OF MAKING THE

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:28.697

TEAM CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO

SUPPORT THIS -- AND AND I THINK

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:42.310
THAT STILL THE CASE -- WE ARE A

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.146
DONOR STATE HOW WE SEND MORE

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:45.981
MONEY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:48.683
THAN WHAT WE RECEIVE FROM THEM

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.585
AND I HAVE GOT A LITTLE

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:51.853
CONSTERNATION THAT THE

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.456
ADMINISTRATION ISN'T -- ISN'T

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:55.290
THINKING THAT WE SHOULD GO

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:56.958
FORWARD WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:58.193
IS ONE WAY.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.528
I'M EVEN THE RUBIK'S CUBE AND

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.296
THAT IT IS FOR US TO GET SOME OF

01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:02.464
THOSE RESOURCES BACK FROM THE

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:04.166
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THAT WE

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:06.001
HAVE THAT WE SEND -- SEND --

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:08.737
THAT THAT WAY I HOPE AND AND I

01:20:08.803 --> 01:20:10.138
DON'T WANNA AND SUGGEST THAT

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:11.406
THIS IS THE CASE.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.141
BUT I HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:15.377
THAT -- WE'RE NOT SURE THAT THE

01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:17.546
THE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ONE

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:20.682
AGREE -- TO TO TO OUR PROPOSAL --

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.517
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE RHETORIC --

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:23.952
THAT IS BEEN GOING TO HELP THE

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:26.521
POLITICS IT DOESN'T GET IN TO

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:28.323
THIS I'VE BEEN -- MYSELF A

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.258
CRITIC OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:31.426
WHEN THEY ARE WHEN THEY HAVEN'T

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:32.627
BEEN SUPPORTING LIKE THE WILD

01:20:32.694 --> 01:20:34.129
FIRES NOT MAKING SURE THAT WE

BECAUSE THE RHETORIC BUT IT GOES

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:38.500
BOTH THE BILL GOES BOTH WAYS

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:39.501
THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:40.902
IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:41.670
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:43.238

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- AND I

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:46.208

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:51.580
IT WE'VE GOT IN BEFORE I DO

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:53.448

FORWARD ON THIS WE WANT TO FIND

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:01.189
A WAY TO GET AN EXTENSION THAT

MEETS FEDERAL APPROVAL WHAT WE

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.458

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:04.926
IS THAT WE DO NOT ALLOCATE AND

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:06.127
COMMIT TO SPEND MONEY THAT WERE

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:07.862

THEN IF WE DO GET APPROVAL AND

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:17.405
WE CAN FIND A WAY TO ALLOCATE

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:19.507
THE MONEY THAT COMES FROM THAT.

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:19.941

REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED

OF THEM DESPITE THIS REDIRECTION

01:27:07.021 --> 01:27:08.957
THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES

PROGRAM BOARD HAS ACCUMULATED A

01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:12.493
SIGNIFICANT RESERVE.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.729
ESTIMATED TO BE NEARLY FOUR

OPERATIONS FOR SO FOR SEVERAL

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.303
YEARS WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL NEW

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:23.938
REVENUE.

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:25.206
THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:26.908
STOPPING THE FLOW OF ALL

REVENUES ARE REDUCED.

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:34.115
AND AFTER THAT POINT IT WOULD

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.083
INCREASE THE REDIRECTION

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:38.820
PERCENTAGE FROM 6275%.

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:40.622
HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT UNDER

THE COMPLEX REALIGNMENT FUNDING

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:44.092
RULES THIS INCREASE EVERY

THE CMS P. BOARD.

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:50.965
WHICH MEANS THAT IN EFFECT --

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:52.767
THE INCREASE FOR DIRECTION WOULD

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:54.502
REDIRECT ALL OF THE SAME AS P.

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:57.739
BOARDS REVENUES -- EVEN AFTER

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:00.875
BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:01.743
HAVE ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:04.212

REDUCED IT WOULD RECEIVE

01:28:14.188 --> 01:28:16.624

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:17.759
VIEW IS UNLIKELY UNDER THE

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:22.864
SENATE ACTION.

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:24.065
AND IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:25.566
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IN THE

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.468
FUTURE WHAT THE ROLE OF SEEM AS

GIVEN POTENTIAL FUTURE

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:33.241
EXPANSIONS IN COVERAGE -- BUT AT

THIS POINT AFTER THE NINETEEN

TWENTY FISCAL YEAR -- THE

LEGISLATURE DOESN'T NEED TO MAKE

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:40.448
A DECISION ABOUT THAT -- AT THIS

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:43.751

EXPANSIONS BEYOND THOSE AGES

01:28:57.465 --> 01:28:59.434

TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- THAT

RECEIVE -- OF FUNDING THROUGH

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:30.031
THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:31.132
THEY ARE -- THEY ARE A

01:34:31.198 --> 01:34:33.100
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:34.935
PROVIDER COMMUNITY IN MEDI CAL

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:37.104
AND THE ASSEMBLY -- HAS PROPOSED

TO EXTEND THESE PAYMENTS TO THEM --

01:34:39.573 --> 01:34:41.842
JUST TO PROVIDE THAT NOW SOME --

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:44.678
ARE LA -- COMMENTS SO WE SENT

01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:46.680
OUT -- TO OUR ISSUES FOR

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:49.083
CONSIDERATION RECENTLY AND FIRST

01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:51.318
WE'D WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:53.187
THE PROPOSED SUNSETS FOR

01:34:53.254 --> 01:34:55.423
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX SPENDING --

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:57.391
IN LINE WITH THE SENATE'S ACTION

01:34:57.458 --> 01:34:58.993
WHILE WE DO THINK TE THE

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.262
OVERALL -- PROVIDER PAYMENT

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:03.297
INCREASES UNDER PROPOSITION

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:04.799
FIFTY SIX SHOULD BE REEVALUATED

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:05.866
TO REALLY UNDER BETTER

01:35:05.933 --> 01:35:08.569
UNDERSTAND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:10.037
WE DO NOT THINK THAT -- SUN

01:35:10.104 --> 01:35:11.739
SETTING THEM FOR FISCAL

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:14.675
MANAGEMENT REASONS -- IS A IS A

01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:16.410
IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF FUND --

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:18.579
OF THE OF THE FUND AND THEN

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:21.882
SECONDLY WE HAVE A WE HAVE --

01:35:21.949 --> 01:35:24.618
PUT OUT -- SOME COMMENTS ON THE

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:26.587
VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM AND

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:28.622
QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:30.124
A COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM IN

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.625
LIGHT OF SOME PARALLEL EFFORTS

01:35:31.692 --> 01:35:33.327
THAT ARE BEING PURSUED BY THE

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:33.861
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:38.532
SERVICES. TO REALLY INCREASE

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:39.733
QUALITY OF CARE.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.002
AND SO CONCEPTUALLY WE DO -- WE

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:43.504
WE LIKE THAT SOMEBODY'S APPROACH

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.106
OF REDUCING FUNDING FOR THAT

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:48.109
PROGRAM AND DO LIKE THE IDEA OF

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:50.511
TARGETING FUNDING INCREASES FOR

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:52.279
PROVIDERS WITHIN THE FEE FOR

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:54.115
SERVICE SYSTEM.

01:35:54.181 --> 01:35:56.417
AS THE ASSEMBLY HAS SO HAPPY TO

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:58.719
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.

01:35:58.786 --> 01:36:00.421
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FINANCE WILL

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:02.123
MAKE THREE BRIEF POINTS FIRST

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:03.457
YEAR MINISTRATION CONTINUES TO

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:04.558
PLACE A PRIORITY ON THE VALUE

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:06.060
BASED PROGRAMS AND WE BELIEVE

01:36:06.127 --> 01:36:07.995
THAT PROGRAMS DOES HAVE VALUE OF

01:36:08.062 --> 01:36:09.830
COURSE UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY

01:36:09.897 --> 01:36:10.798
SIX PROPOSAL.

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:12.233
THERE IS A HUGE SHARE OF MONEY

01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:13.968
GOING TO INCREASING PAYMENTS TO

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:15.469
PROVIDERS BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE

01:36:15.536 --> 01:36:16.804
CONSISTENT WITH THAT THAT WE

01:36:16.871 --> 01:36:18.038
SHOULD PUT MORE MONEY INTO

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:20.407
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET

01:36:20.474 --> 01:36:20.808
MORE AND BETTER.

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:21.408
HEALTH.

01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:22.943
BETTER OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS FOR

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:24.445
WHAT WE ARE PAYING SO WE DO

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:26.647
BELIEVE THAT THE EIGHTY NINE

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:27.715
DOLLARS A THE ADMITTED THAT THE

01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:28.849
ASSEMBLY HAS PROPOSED RE

01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:30.885
DIRECTING SHOULD CONTINUE TO

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:32.386
STAY IN THAT PROGRAM.

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:34.021
THE SECOND POINT IS SPECIFICALLY

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:36.123
FOR VALUE BASED PAYMENTS FOR

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:36.891
FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH

01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:39.560
CENTERS -- THOSE ARE ALREADY

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:40.694
THIS PAYMENTS ARE CRIER RECEIVED

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:41.929
UNDER PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT RATE

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:44.198
SYSTEM WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:45.099
THE PAYMENTS THAT.

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.834
OFTEN OTHERWISE UNDER MEDI CAL

01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:48.169
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT PAYMENT

01:36:48.235 --> 01:36:50.004
SYSTEM IS SUFFICIENT WHERE WE DO

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:51.805
NOT NECESSARILY NEED TO INCLUDE

01:36:51.872 --> 01:36:53.307
THOSE WITH THE REST OF THE VALUE

01:36:53.374 --> 01:36:54.808
BASED PAYMENTS WE BELIEVE THAT'S

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.210
UNNECESSARY AND THAT MONEY CAN.

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:57.611
BETTER BE USED TO THE WAY THE

01:36:57.678 --> 01:36:59.013
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

01:36:59.079 --> 01:37:01.282
RIGHT NOW AND FINALLY ON THE

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:03.017
THIRD POINT THE SUN SETS WE

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:04.418
DISCUSS THAT ONCE I KNOW LAST

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:05.085
THURSDAY.

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:06.453
SO NOT MUCH TO ADD ON THAT

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.489
EXCEPT TO SAY THAT WE DO BELIEVE

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:10.491

IMPROVED FISCAL ESTIMATES AN

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:15.282
INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT THE

01:49:26.092 --> 01:49:27.961
SENATE HAD SUPPORTED OUR A

01:49:28.028 --> 01:49:30.630
PROPOSAL IN THIS AREA -- I

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:32.265
ACTUALLY BROUGHT ALONG WITH ME --

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:34.200
PAGE FROM THE LA OWES ANALYSIS

01:49:34.267 --> 01:49:36.169
OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:36.836
BUDGET IN WHICH THEY HAD A TEXT

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:37.537
BOX.

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:38.872
LOOKING AT KIND OF SOME OF THE

01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:41.007
MAIN CAUSES OF MEDI CAL

01:49:41.074 --> 01:49:43.109
VOLATILITY -- ESTIMATE

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:45.845
VOLATILITY -- AND YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:49:45.912 --> 01:49:47.147
HEARD A LOT FROM THE LEGISLATURE

01:49:47.213 --> 01:49:48.515
IN RECENT YEARS ABOUT THE

01:49:48.581 --> 01:49:51.451
CHALLENGES THAT THIS HAS CAUSED --

01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:53.253
FOR IT FOR GENERAL FUND PLANNING.

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.454
HI WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE

01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:56.323
SHARE THOSE FRUSTRATIONS BECAUSE

01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:58.224
IT ALSO IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO

01:49:58.291 --> 01:50:00.894
PLAN -- FOR GENERAL FUND

01:50:00.961 --> 01:50:03.096
BUDGETING -- BUT BRIEFLY ON THE

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:05.899
ALLEY AS TEXT BOX HERE -- THEY

01:50:05.966 --> 01:50:07.233
THEY MENTION THREE DIFFERENT

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:10.236
THINGS -- MANAGED CARE PAYMENTS --

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:12.038
WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:13.139
DIFFERENT MANAGED CARE RATES

01:50:13.206 --> 01:50:14.507
THAT ARE APPROVED EACH YEAR BY

01:50:14.574 --> 01:50:16.042
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:17.811
TIMING OF THOSE RATES BECAUSE

01:50:17.877 --> 01:50:19.512
THE MEDI CAL BUDGET IS ON A CASH

01:50:19.579 --> 01:50:21.715
BASIS -- THE TIMING OF THOSE

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:23.917
APPROVALS IF WE DON'T GET THAT

01:50:23.984 --> 01:50:25.752
RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BE OFF --

01:50:25.819 --> 01:50:27.187
THE NUMBER TWO ONE THAT THEY

01:50:27.253 --> 01:50:28.521
POINTED OUT WAS THE QUALITY

01:50:28.588 --> 01:50:30.590
ISSUE THE HOSPITAL QUALITY

01:50:30.657 --> 01:50:31.825
ASSURANCE BE -- WHICH PROVIDES

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:32.826
AN OVER ONE BILLION DOLLAR

01:50:32.892 --> 01:50:35.462
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT EVERY YEAR.

01:50:35.528 --> 01:50:38.264
AND THE THIRD -- DRUG REBATES WE

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:39.899
GET SAVINGS FROM.

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:42.135
FROM DRUG REBATES THAT ARE --

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:45.372
NEGOTIATED WITH MANUFACTURERS --

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:46.639
I WANTED TO POINT THESE OUT

01:50:46.706 --> 01:50:48.775
BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:50.410
OUR REVENUE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:51.845
HAD SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHERE WE

01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:53.580
LOOKED AT WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS

01:50:53.646 --> 01:50:54.914
WE HAD TO ADDRESS REVENUE

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:55.849
VOLATILITY.

01:50:55.915 --> 01:50:57.017
I THINK WE HAVE A SIMILAR

01:50:57.083 --> 01:50:59.219
DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT -- HOW TO

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:00.920
ADDRESS MEDI CAL VOLATILITY IN

01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:03.356
AND IN EACH OF THESE CASES?

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:04.958
PRINCIPALLY THINGS LIKE THE

01:51:05.025 --> 01:51:06.860
QUALITY ASSURANCE FEES -- THERE

01:51:06.926 --> 01:51:08.795
ARE STRONG POLICY REASONS WHY WE

01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:09.796
WOULDN'T WANT TO GET RIDOF

01:51:09.863 --> 01:51:11.431
THESE MECHANISMS THEY PROVIDED

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:12.999
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT IN SOME

01:51:13.066 --> 01:51:14.601
CASES THEY PROVIDE PROVIDER

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:17.103
BENEFITS THEY MADE IT IN AND IN

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.905
MANY CASES THEY ALSO -- INCENT

01:51:18.972 --> 01:51:21.441
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MEDI CAL

01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:22.142
PROGRAM.

01:51:22.208 --> 01:51:23.343
AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW

01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:25.745
CAN WE INSTEAD MANAGE THAT MEDI

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:27.380
CAL VOLATILITY.

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.182
WE HAD TO PROPOSALS THIS YEAR

01:51:29.249 --> 01:51:30.150
THE FIRST A COVER VERY QUICKLY

01:51:30.216 --> 01:51:32.819
BECAUSE BOTH HOUSES APPROVED IT --

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:34.454
WE CREATED A SPECIAL FUND IN

01:51:34.521 --> 01:51:36.990
WHICH TO DEPOSIT DRUG REBATE --

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:39.592
SAVINGS -- AND THE CONCEPT WAS

01:51:39.659 --> 01:51:41.728
KIND OF LIKE PROPOSITION TWO

01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:43.296
THAT WITH PROPOSITION TWO YOU

01:51:43.363 --> 01:51:45.365
TAKE OFF SPIKES IN CAPITAL GAINS

01:51:45.432 --> 01:51:46.900
REVENUES TO TRY TO SMOOTH OUT

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:48.868
GENERAL FUND SPENDING --

01:51:48.935 --> 01:51:51.738
LIKEWISE WHEN WHEN DRUG REBATE

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:53.239
SAVINGS EXCEED OUR INITIAL

01:51:53.306 --> 01:51:55.475
ESTIMATES WE PLAN TO DEPOSIT

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:56.776
SOME OF THOSE SAVINGS INTO THE

01:51:56.843 --> 01:51:58.445
SPECIAL FUND AND USE THEM FOR

01:51:58.511 --> 01:52:00.814
WHEN WE ACTUALLY UNDERESTIMATE

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.282
OUR SAVINGS TO TRY TO SMOOTH OUT

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:03.483
THE EFFECT.

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:05.118
OF THOSE REBATES ON THE GENERAL

01:52:05.185 --> 01:52:06.553
FUND AND THE SECOND IS THIS

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:10.857
PROPOSAL -- WHICH I THINK -- HAS

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:13.927
A FEW DIFFERENT PURPOSES ONE IS --

01:52:13.993 --> 01:52:15.695
WHAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE THE

01:52:15.762 --> 01:52:17.230

CALL THE FEES AND OTHER

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:23.002
ENHANCEMENTS ALSO HAPPEN TO BE

01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:25.839
VERY COMPLEX -- AND THE TIMING

01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:28.775
OF TRANSACTIONS -- THE TIMING OF

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:31.144
OF SETTLING UP -- FOR DIFFERENT --

01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:32.245
ITEMS WITH THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THIS IS ON A

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.548
CASH BASIS AND IT WOULD CST I

01:52:35.615 --> 01:52:37.584
BELIEVE OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:39.419
ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO PUT IT

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:40.687
ON THE CRUEL BASIS.

01:52:40.753 --> 01:52:41.454
YOU KNOW IT WOULD PROBABLY BE

01:52:41.521 --> 01:52:45.558
VERY DIFFICULT TO PRIORITIZE

01:52:45.625 --> 01:52:48.094
THAT -- WE WE WANTED TO TRY TO

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:50.930
ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS BY -- ON

01:52:50.997 --> 01:52:51.965
THE ONE HAND PROVIDING

01:52:52.031 --> 01:52:53.700
ADDITIONAL ANALYTICAL CAPACITY

01:52:57.837 --> 01:52:59.272
BETTER ANALYZING AYE

01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:01.908
TRANSACTIONS IN CASH TRENDS --

01:53:01.975 --> 01:53:03.443
AND ALSO IMPROVING GIVING

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.511

01:53:08.815 --> 01:53:10.984
NUMBER -- TWO WE'RE GONNA BE

01:53:11.050 --> 01:53:12.719
INCREASED IMPROVING COORDINATION

01:53:12.785 --> 01:53:14.487

TALK TO EACH OTHER BETTER.

01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:35.942
AND LASTLY WE WANT TO CENTRALIZE

TO CLOSE YOU KNOW WE WE REALLY

01:53:49.455 --> 01:53:50.256
DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

01:53:50.323 --> 01:53:51.758
NECESSARY COMPONENT OF

01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:54.093
CONTINUING. TO TO MINIMIZE THE

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.328
IMPACT THAT THE BALLOT CAL

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:56.829
ESTIMATE IS HAVING ON THE

01:53:56.896 --> 01:54:01.534
GENERAL FUND -- WITH BAD WERE

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:09.742
HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS -- WE WE

01:54:09.809 --> 01:54:11.911
REJECT THE ITEM BECAUSE WE

01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:12.779

DO I DON'T THINK YOU.

01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:19.852
GIVE THE PROPER CONTEXT OF THE

01:54:19.919 --> 01:54:21.554
SITUATION AND THE REASON.

01:54:21.621 --> 01:54:24.257
WE ENDED UP REJECTING THOSE

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:26.159
POSITIONS IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:28.361
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION AND IN

01:54:28.428 --> 01:54:29.028
WITH THE P..

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:32.532
NAT SHORTFALL THAT WAS.

01:54:32.599 --> 01:54:34.100

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:35.868
BECAUSE OF WHAT WHAT HAD

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:37.870
HAPPENED SO I THINK WE WE ALL

01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:39.105

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:41.341
THIS THIS IS AN ISSUE WE ALL

01:54:41.407 --> 01:54:42.575

TO HAVE BETTER ESTIMATES -- I

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:51.317
THINK WHEN WE DRILL DOWN ON THE

01:54:51.384 --> 01:54:51.751
ISSUE WITH IT WE GET

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:56.522

IT'S EACH OTHER THEY HAVE TO BE --

01:58:16.322 --> 01:58:18.057
TRACKING THESE THINGS AND AND

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:19.592

IMPACT IS -- ON THE MEDI CAL

01:58:34.607 --> 01:58:37.710
ESTIMATE -- REALLY -- I THINK

01:58:37.777 --> 01:58:40.012
AGAIN IT KIND OF  HIGHER LEVEL --

01:58:40.079 --> 01:58:41.848
TEN OF THE TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:43.216
WOULD BE.

01:58:43.282 --> 01:58:44.450
FOR ESSENTIALLY IMPROVING THE

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:46.052
ESTIMATE ITSELF.

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.320

01:58:47.386 --> 01:58:50.656
I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE --

01:58:50.723 --> 01:58:52.825
FOR COORDINATING BETTER -- FOR

01:58:52.892 --> 01:58:55.828
TRYING TO TRACK ALL OF THIS

01:58:55.895 --> 01:58:57.296
COMPLEXITY BETTER.

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:58.531
IT SOUNDS LIKE HALF THE

01:58:58.598 --> 01:59:00.800
POSITIONS ARE. TO ASSIST WITH

01:59:00.867 --> 01:59:02.368
TEST.

01:59:02.435 --> 01:59:03.636
ANALYZING AND COMBING THROUGH

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:07.907
THE DATA.

01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:08.908
CORRECT AND THEN SOUNDS LIKE THE

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:09.942
OTHER HALF IS. TO SORT OF

01:59:10.009 --> 01:59:11.777
IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:13.079
THE VARIOUS.

01:59:13.145 --> 01:59:14.714
YEAH AND AND AND THE VISION YOU

01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:15.681
KNOW BOTH FROM LIKE AN

TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO

02:12:19.898 --> 02:12:22.334
AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE

02:12:22.401 --> 02:12:23.902
SENATE ACTION REDUCES SUPPORT

FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN

02:12:25.737 --> 02:12:27.506
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BY TWENTY

02:12:27.572 --> 02:12:29.141
THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS --

02:12:29.207 --> 02:12:30.475
FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO REFLECT

02:12:30.542 --> 02:12:31.643
THAT SAVINGS RELATED TO THIS

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:34.479
ACTION -- IN LIGHT OF THE STRONG

02:12:34.546 --> 02:12:35.981
LIKELIHOOD THAT EXPANDING THE

02:12:36.048 --> 02:12:37.616
ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER WOULD

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:39.351
RESULT IN SOME STATES SAVINGS WE

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:40.886
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:12:40.952 --> 02:12:42.154
ADOPT THE SENSE ACTION AND

02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:43.355
CONCEPT.

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:46.158
HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT --

02:12:46.224 --> 02:12:48.126
THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS OVER ITS

02:12:48.193 --> 02:12:49.895
PARTICULAR VER THE LONGER TERM

02:12:49.961 --> 02:12:52.531
EXPANSION -- MAY NOT BE -- AS

02:12:52.597 --> 02:12:55.267
SIGNIFICANT AS HAS ESTIMATED --

02:12:55.334 --> 02:12:56.268
ONE ISSUE TO KEEP IN MIND IS

02:12:56.335 --> 02:12:58.437
THAT -- THIS PROGRAM TARGETS

02:12:58.503 --> 02:12:59.838
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SKILLED

02:12:59.905 --> 02:13:01.740
NURSING FACILITIES -- WHERE THE

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:02.708
COST THE STATE ARE MORE

02:13:02.774 --> 02:13:04.343
SIGNIFICANT BUT THAT ARE WELL

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:05.577
SUITED?

02:13:05.644 --> 02:13:06.878
TO RESIDE IN ASSISTED LIVING

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.146
FACILITY IN AFTER A CERTAIN

02:13:08.213 --> 02:13:09.715
POINT IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR

02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:10.982
WHERE THAT WOULD BE.

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:12.651
AFTER A CERTAIN POINT THE POOL

02:13:12.718 --> 02:13:14.619
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHAT WILL

02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:15.754
RUN OUT AND AFTER THAT.

02:13:15.821 --> 02:13:16.722
AND THE LEVEL OF SAVINGS WOULD

02:13:16.788 --> 02:13:18.824
BE DIMINISH SO IT'S NOT CLEAR

02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:22.561
THAT -- THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS

02:13:22.627 --> 02:13:23.495
WOULD BE CONSISTENT OVER THE

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:25.864
ENTIRE RAMP UP OF OF THE SENSE

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:26.431
ACTION.

02:13:26.498 --> 02:13:29.134
AT SECOND IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY

02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:30.202
THE SENATE ACTION LIKELY

02:13:30.268 --> 02:13:31.470
OVERSTATES THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS

02:13:31.536 --> 02:13:33.071
THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR A

02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:34.773
FEW REASONS NUMBER -- ONE WE

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:35.807
BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

02:13:35.874 --> 02:13:37.409
CARE SERVICES WOULD LIKELY

02:13:37.476 --> 02:13:39.277
REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL STATE

02:13:39.344 --> 02:13:40.912
OPERATIONS RESOURCES OUT LIKELY

02:13:40.979 --> 02:13:41.980
NOT MORE THAN A FEW MILLION

02:13:42.047 --> 02:13:43.415
DOLLARS TO PROCESS THE TO

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:44.616
ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS FROM A

02:13:44.683 --> 02:13:47.586
SIGNIFICANT RAMP UP OF SLOTS --

02:13:47.652 --> 02:13:48.954
SECOND -- INCREASING THE

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:50.922
CAPACITY OF THE PROGRAM WOULD

02:13:50.989 --> 02:13:52.958
REQUIRE FEDERAL APPROVAL --

02:13:53.024 --> 02:13:53.692
BEFORE THE SLOTS COULD BE

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:56.361
CREATED -- AND THEN ONCE THE

02:13:56.428 --> 02:13:57.729
SLOTS ARE CREATED IT WOULD TAKE

02:13:57.796 --> 02:13:58.997
SOME TIME TO PAY TO PROCESS

02:13:59.064 --> 02:14:00.499
APPLICATIONS AND ALTHOUGH THE

02:14:00.565 --> 02:14:02.667
SENATE ACTION DOES REFLECT.

02:14:02.734 --> 02:14:04.803
A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION THE

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:06.838
ADDITIONAL SLOTS OUR SIGNIFICAN

02:14:06.905 --> 02:14:07.939
AND NUMBER AND AND WE BELIEVE

02:14:08.006 --> 02:14:10.142
THAT -- THE ROLE I WOULD LIKELY

02:14:10.208 --> 02:14:14.379
BE SLOWER THAN WHAT IT IS SOON

02:14:14.446 --> 02:14:15.947
TO THE SENATE ACTION.

02:14:16.014 --> 02:14:17.249
THANK YOU FINANCE.

02:14:17.315 --> 02:14:18.617
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SOME

02:14:18.683 --> 02:14:19.885
CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR SAVINGS

02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:21.820
ESTIMATES -- SOME OF THE REASONS

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:24.689
WERE DESCRIBED BY THE LA OPEN.

02:14:24.756 --> 02:14:26.625
IN ADDITION AND WE LOOK AT THE

02:14:26.691 --> 02:14:28.026
PROPOSAL AND WONDER ABOUT SOME

02:14:28.093 --> 02:14:29.094
OF THE COST PRESSURES INCLUDING

02:14:29.161 --> 02:14:30.228
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT MAY

02:14:30.295 --> 02:14:32.230
NOT BE REFLECTED IN THE PROPOSAL.

02:14:32.297 --> 02:14:34.166
AND THEN FINALLY MORE BROADLY WE

02:14:34.232 --> 02:14:35.967
BELIEVE THAT THE EXPANSION WERE

02:14:36.034 --> 02:14:37.135
WHETHER TO EXPERT THE QUESTION

02:14:37.202 --> 02:14:38.136
OF WHETHER TO EXPAND THIS

02:14:38.203 --> 02:14:38.837
PROGRAM.

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:40.539
IS A BROADER POLICY DECISION

02:14:40.605 --> 02:14:41.773
THAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IN THE

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:47.412
CONTEXT OF THE TRANSFORMATION.

02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:48.346
THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR

02:14:48.413 --> 02:14:50.849
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND AS WELL

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:52.250
THE RENEWAL OR POSSIBLE RENEWAL

02:14:52.317 --> 02:14:53.718
OF THIS WAIVER AN INTEGRATION

02:14:53.785 --> 02:14:55.654
WITH ANOTHER WAIVER.

02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:57.989
OVER THE NEXT ONE TO TWO YEARS

02:14:58.056 --> 02:15:00.425
A QUICK QUESTION I HAVE IN TERMS

02:15:00.492 --> 02:15:02.360
OF THE WAITING LIST BECAUSE THE

02:15:02.427 --> 02:15:05.697
WAIVER WAS FOR REALLY A MERE

02:15:05.764 --> 02:15:07.165
FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED SLOT -- IS

02:15:07.232 --> 02:15:09.668
THAT A NUMBER THAT WE REQUESTED

02:15:09.734 --> 02:15:11.236
THE WAIVER IS AT LOOK WHAT THE

02:15:11.303 --> 02:15:12.771
FEDS CAME AND HOW HOW DID THAT

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:15.974
NUMBER COME ABOUT -- SINCE WE DO

02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:18.643
HAVE A WAITING LIST.

02:15:18.710 --> 02:15:20.378
SO THE WAIVER HISTORICALLY HAS

02:15:20.445 --> 02:15:22.080
BEEN AT ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND

02:15:22.147 --> 02:15:23.748
SLOTS AND THAT'S BEEN OVER A TEN

02:15:23.815 --> 02:15:25.584
PLUS YEARS -- WE RECENTLY

02:15:25.650 --> 02:15:27.619
EXPANDED BY TWO THOUSAND SLOTS

02:15:27.686 --> 02:15:28.153
IN THE NEW TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:30.155
BUDGET ACT -- AND THIS WAIVER

02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:32.324
WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE.

02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:33.625
RIGHT NOW IT OPERATES AND

02:15:33.692 --> 02:15:34.893
FIFTEEN COUNTY SO IT'S ALL IT

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.628
WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE AT A

02:15:36.695 --> 02:15:37.729
AT A MINOR.

02:15:37.796 --> 02:15:41.967
SCALE -- AND SO YES SO STARKLY

02:15:42.033 --> 02:15:43.602
ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND I'M WORRIED

02:15:43.668 --> 02:15:46.905
ABOUT SIX THOUSAND NOW -- SLOTS

02:15:46.972 --> 02:15:49.641
WE CONSIDER AS WE TALK ABOUT IN

02:15:49.708 --> 02:15:50.675
MANY INSTANCES IN BOTH THE

02:15:50.742 --> 02:15:52.277
NUMBER POLICY COMMITTEES BUT

02:15:52.344 --> 02:15:54.045
PLUS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE -- THE

02:15:54.112 --> 02:15:56.081
AGING OF THE STATE'S POPULATION

02:15:56.147 --> 02:15:58.283
IT IF ARE THOUGHT TO BE AT FOUR

02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:59.818
THOUSAND FOUR DECADE IT JUST

02:15:59.885 --> 02:16:02.287
SEEMS -- GIVEN THE COST SAVINGS

02:16:02.354 --> 02:16:04.022
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE PEOPLE

02:16:04.089 --> 02:16:06.191
WHO ARE HAVE THE CAPACITY BEING

02:16:06.258 --> 02:16:07.425
ASSISTED LIVING VERSUS THE SMITH

02:16:07.492 --> 02:16:09.494
JUST SEEMS PRUDENT.

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:15.333
SO IS THERE -- AS WE GO FORWARD.

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:16.501
IF IF THAT YOUR ASSERTION THAT

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.069
WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE.

02:16:18.136 --> 02:16:20.205
ISN'T IN THEFISCAL BEST

02:16:20.272 --> 02:16:20.805
INTERESTS AT THE STAKE IS A

02:16:20.872 --> 02:16:22.173
BECAUSE WE IN EFFECT WOULD BE

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:26.011
UPSIDE DOWN -- ARE.

02:16:26.077 --> 02:16:28.680
DO YOU AT ANY POINT -- HAVE AN

02:16:28.747 --> 02:16:30.282
INTENTION TO TRY TO INCREASE THE

02:16:30.348 --> 02:16:32.751
NUMBER OF SLOTS. FOR THE WAIVER

02:16:32.817 --> 02:16:34.786
IN THE FUTURE.

02:16:34.853 --> 02:16:36.054
SO THEN TEN WHAT DOES WAIVER

02:16:36.121 --> 02:16:38.256
BECAUSE AGAIN IT IS ONLY LIMITED

02:16:38.323 --> 02:16:39.391
TO FIFTEEN COUNTIES AND THAT WE

02:16:39.457 --> 02:16:41.560
WOULD INTEGRATE THIS WAIVER --

02:16:41.626 --> 02:16:43.395
WITH THE HOME AND COMMUNITY

02:16:43.461 --> 02:16:45.096
BASED ALTERNATIVES WAIVER DURING

02:16:45.163 --> 02:16:47.365
THE NEXT RENEWAL IN A FEW YEARS

02:16:47.432 --> 02:16:48.900
OKAY AND SO THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR

02:16:48.967 --> 02:16:50.569
A BROADER SCALABILITY THROUGHOUT

02:16:50.635 --> 02:16:52.771
THE STATE -- BUT FOR NOW THE

02:16:52.837 --> 02:16:56.841
WAIVER IS IS LIMITED -- IN SCOPE.

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:58.009
GOT IT.

02:16:58.076 --> 02:16:59.978

02:17:03.648 --> 02:17:10.522
DIFFICULTY WITH THE TERM SLOTS.

ROOM TWO PEOPLE PER ROOM.

02:17:20.865 --> 02:17:23.301
I'VE JUST JUST WONDER IF THERE'S

02:17:23.368 --> 02:17:24.636
A BETTER TERM.

02:17:24.703 --> 02:17:26.137
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TELL MY

02:17:26.204 --> 02:17:28.106

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:28.673

FOR IT DEPENDS ON THE THE

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:35.413
FACILITIES SO IN A SKILLED

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:36.881
NURSING FACILITY IT'S PROBABLY A

02:17:36.948 --> 02:17:38.116
BAD.

02:17:38.183 --> 02:17:39.918
IN AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY

02:17:39.985 --> 02:17:41.519
IT COULD BE EITHER OR IT COULD

02:17:46.925 --> 02:17:48.393
THE STEP.

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:49.327
POINT MAYBE WE COULD LOOK AT IN

02:17:49.394 --> 02:17:50.729
THE FUTURE THAT MAYBE WE CAN

02:17:50.795 --> 02:17:53.064
FIND BETTER NOMENCLATURE JUST A

02:18:39.978 --> 02:18:41.646
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID.

02:18:41.713 --> 02:18:45.216
THE MINISTER OF THE PROGRAM --

02:18:45.283 --> 02:18:46.618
ACCORDING TO THIS EXPANSION SO

02:18:46.685 --> 02:18:48.053
GOING FROM FROM SIX THOUSAND

02:18:48.119 --> 02:18:51.189
SLOTS APPROXIMATELY TWO EIGHTEEN

02:18:51.256 --> 02:18:51.723
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND REQUIRE

02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:52.824
ADDITIONAL STAFF RESOURCES TO

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:54.826
ADMINISTER.

02:18:54.893 --> 02:18:56.027
THE EXPANSION.

02:18:56.094 --> 02:18:57.629
AND THE ADDITIONAL PERSON THOUGH

02:18:57.696 --> 02:19:00.065
ARE ARE ALREADY ASSUME IN SOME

02:19:00.131 --> 02:19:02.233
SYSTEM IS THAT CORRECT THESE ARE.

02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:03.668
COMPLETELY NEW INDIVIDUALS.

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:05.603
THE WORK CURRENTLY AT ABOUT SIX

02:19:05.670 --> 02:19:07.072
THOUSAND SLOTS BUT THE EXPANSION

02:19:07.138 --> 02:19:09.340
WOULD BE NEW INDIVIDUALS.

02:19:09.407 --> 02:19:11.042
OKAY.

02:19:11.109 --> 02:19:11.876
SO THAT'S WHY YOU NEED THE EXTRA

02:19:11.943 --> 02:19:12.877
ONE NOT NECESSARILY MOVING

02:19:12.944 --> 02:19:15.013

02:19:19.184 --> 02:19:20.852
LEVEL OF CARE.

02:19:20.919 --> 02:19:22.153
SO THESE WOULD BE PRINT BRENDA

02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:23.888
PEOPLE WE WOULD NOT BE ASSESSING

02:19:23.955 --> 02:19:25.423
THOSE WILL CURRENTLY IN A

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:26.558
FACILITY.

02:19:26.624 --> 02:19:28.693
THAT IS A SAY AT THE NURSING

FACILITY AND DECIDING THAT THEY

02:19:30.662 --> 02:19:32.430
DON'T NEED AS MUCH CARE AND

02:19:32.497 --> 02:19:33.465
THEREFORE IT'S COULD BE PLACED

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:34.365
INTO.

02:19:34.432 --> 02:19:36.167
AN ASSISTED LIVING IS OR WOULD

02:19:36.234 --> 02:19:37.802

SMITH BUT I THINK THEY'RE COMING

02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:49.114
FROM SNIFF DOCTOR WEBER WITH

02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:50.115
THAT YEAH THEIR CRIME WAS AND I

02:19:50.181 --> 02:19:51.349
WAS WONDERING BECAUSE IT WAS

02:19:51.416 --> 02:19:52.016
THEY WERE GOING TO SAVE MONEY BY

02:19:52.083 --> 02:19:52.851
HAVING.

02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:54.986
A FEW OF THEM INTO THE SKILLED

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:56.654
NURSING FACILITY BECAUSE OF THE

02:19:56.721 --> 02:19:57.655
COST.

02:19:57.722 --> 02:19:58.990
OF THE CONTRACT RIGHT AND AND

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:00.759
AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS HAT I

02:20:00.825 --> 02:20:01.326
WOULD THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING

02:20:01.393 --> 02:20:02.260
THEY'RE ALREADY.

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:03.628
DEALING WITH THIS POPULATION YOU

02:20:03.695 --> 02:20:05.163
KNOW SOMETIMES WE ASK FOR STAFF

02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:06.731
AND WE REALLY DON'T NEED STAFF

02:20:06.798 --> 02:20:07.632
BECAUSE YOU DEAL WITH THE SAME

02:20:07.699 --> 02:20:08.733
POPULATION AND YOU DOING AN

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:10.335
ASSESSMENT.

02:20:10.402 --> 02:20:11.469
OF WHERE THEY ARE AND WITHIN

02:20:11.536 --> 02:20:12.437
THAT IT'S AN APPROPRIATE

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:13.972
PLACEMENT BUT IF YOU'RE ADDING

02:20:14.038 --> 02:20:15.173

ADDITIONAL PERSON I WAS JUST

WITH WHAT WHAT WE WERE ACTUALLY

02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:22.747
DOING -- AND AND CLEARLY MOVING

02:42:02.245 --> 02:42:05.048
WOULD BE -- EITHER FORECLOSED ON

02:42:05.115 --> 02:42:06.283
OR SOMEHOW YOU KNOW HAVE TO MOVE

02:42:06.349 --> 02:42:07.617
TO A DIFFERENT COUNTY AND THEY

02:42:14.524 --> 02:42:15.625
PROBLEM NOW HERE WITH THE

02:42:29.706 --> 02:42:31.108
COULD GIVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT

02:42:31.174 --> 02:42:32.943
EXAMPLES WERE SIMILAR WHERE WE

02:42:33.009 --> 02:42:35.078
HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION WHERE.

02:42:35.145 --> 02:42:39.449

THE FUNDING LEVEL TWENTY FIVE

02:47:30.039 --> 02:47:32.208
MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE SENATE

02:47:32.275 --> 02:47:33.777
VERSUS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

FOR THE ASSEMBLY -- AS WELL AS

02:47:36.179 --> 02:47:38.148
THE FUNDING SOURCE GENERAL FUND

02:47:45.221 --> 02:47:47.190
ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE.

02:47:47.257 --> 02:47:48.024
FINANCE WILL MAKE THREE BRIEF

02:47:48.091 --> 02:47:48.691
POINTS -- FIRST WE BELIEVE THAT

02:47:48.758 --> 02:47:49.559
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS

02:47:49.626 --> 02:47:51.327
THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL THIS IS AN

02:47:51.394 --> 02:47:52.328
IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE

02:47:52.395 --> 02:47:53.463
ADMINISTRATION I KNOW IT'S COME

02:47:53.530 --> 02:47:55.665
UP IN DISCUSSION HERE AS WELL

02:47:55.732 --> 02:47:56.933
MAKING SURE THAT AS EARLY AS

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.235
POSSIBLE WE CAN DIAGNOSE AND

02:47:59.302 --> 02:48:00.270
INTERVENE.

02:48:00.336 --> 02:48:01.871
IN THESE TYPES OF CASES.

02:48:01.938 --> 02:48:03.440
THE SECOND POINT IS WE WANTED

02:48:03.506 --> 02:48:05.575
THIS TO BE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE

02:48:05.642 --> 02:48:06.142
FOR WE ARE PROPOSING IN OUR

02:48:06.209 --> 02:48:07.010
BUDGET.

02:48:07.076 --> 02:48:08.511
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND FOR

02:48:08.578 --> 02:48:09.846
THE WEB PROGRAM WORKFORCE

02:48:09.913 --> 02:48:11.014
EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND I

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:12.916
KNOW ALSO EARLIER TODAY WE

02:48:12.982 --> 02:48:13.850
TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO

02:48:13.917 --> 02:48:14.884
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MENTAL

02:48:14.951 --> 02:48:16.152
HEALTH PROVIDERS SO WE THINK

02:48:16.219 --> 02:48:17.520
THAT IS THE BEST USE.

02:48:17.587 --> 02:48:19.889
OF THAT MONEY SO ANY REDIRECTION

02:48:19.956 --> 02:48:21.424
OF THAT MONEY WOULD REDUCE OUR

02:48:21.491 --> 02:48:23.693
ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND

02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:24.861
THEN THE THIRD POINT OUR

02:48:24.928 --> 02:48:26.696
PROPOSAL IS A ONE TIME AND SOME

02:48:26.763 --> 02:48:28.331
OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS ON THE

02:48:28.398 --> 02:48:30.033
TABLE HERE ARE ONGOING.

02:48:30.099 --> 02:48:31.668
AND BECAUSE AS ALL OF YOU KNOW

02:48:31.734 --> 02:48:34.704
THIS MONEY COMES FROM THE TAX OF

02:48:34.771 --> 02:48:36.739
1% MARGINAL ON PEOPLE WHO MAKE

02:48:36.806 --> 02:48:38.074
ABOUT THE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:48:38.141 --> 02:48:39.976
THAT REVENUE -- IS CAN BE FALL

02:48:40.043 --> 02:48:41.444
TILE FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO WE

02:48:41.511 --> 02:48:46.216
pFUNDING FROM THAT REVENUE

02:48:46.282 --> 02:48:48.451
SOURCES MORE APPROPRIATE

02:48:48.518 --> 02:48:48.751

TO FIND -- THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES

03:12:45.353 --> 03:12:46.421
BECAUSE THE BOUNTY REVENUES

03:12:46.488 --> 03:12:47.689
WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL

03:12:47.756 --> 03:12:49.057

03:12:49.124 --> 03:12:50.625

THE COUNTY WOULD BE ON GOING.

03:13:06.341 --> 03:13:07.976
AND WOULD BE PROJECTED TO FULLY

03:13:08.043 --> 03:13:09.577
REIMBURSE THE GENERAL FUND FOR

03:13:09.644 --> 03:13:10.345
THE COST OF THE SUBSIDIES OVER

03:13:10.412 --> 03:13:12.213
THAT PERIOD.

03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:13.715
THE SENATE AUGMENTED FUNDING FOR

03:13:13.782 --> 03:13:15.350
THE SUBSIDIES BY THREE HUNDRED

03:13:15.417 --> 03:13:17.052
MILLION DOLLARS -- OVER THE

03:13:17.118 --> 03:13:18.086
AMOUNT PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR

03:13:18.153 --> 03:13:21.389
IN EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS

03:13:21.456 --> 03:13:23.992
201-920-2020 ONE AND TWENTY ONE

03:13:24.059 --> 03:13:24.559
TWENTY TWO THE SENATE ALSO

03:13:24.626 --> 03:13:26.561
ADOPTED SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE

03:13:26.628 --> 03:13:27.896
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL

03:13:27.963 --> 03:13:29.097
THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT THE

03:13:29.164 --> 03:13:31.032
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

03:13:31.099 --> 03:13:32.367
AND THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES

03:13:32.434 --> 03:13:34.169
SPECIFICALLY THE SENATE LANGUAGE

03:13:34.235 --> 03:13:35.637
WOULD ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WITH

03:13:35.704 --> 03:13:37.639
INCOMES LESS THAN 2100% OF THE

03:13:37.706 --> 03:13:38.907
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO ALSO

03:13:38.974 --> 03:13:40.542
RECEIVE SUBSIDIES.

03:13:40.608 --> 03:13:41.676
IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE

03:13:41.743 --> 03:13:43.445
REQUIREMENT THAT THE SUBSIDIES

03:13:43.511 --> 03:13:45.380
BE LIMITED TO PENALTY REVENUES.

03:13:45.447 --> 03:13:47.148
IT SPECIFIES THAT THE INDIVIDUAL

03:13:47.215 --> 03:13:48.516
MANDATE PENALTY WOULD ONLY BE IN

03:13:48.583 --> 03:13:49.718
EFFECT WHEN A CERTAIN MINIMUM

03:13:49.784 --> 03:13:51.252
LEVEL OF SUBSIDIES EITHER

03:13:51.319 --> 03:13:54.456
FEDERAL OR STATE -- ARE PROVIDED.

03:13:54.522 --> 03:13:56.658
THAT IT EXEMPTS INDIVIDUALS THAT

03:13:56.725 --> 03:13:57.192
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID

03:13:57.258 --> 03:13:59.260
MEDICARE MEDICARE I'LL EXCUSE ME

03:13:59.327 --> 03:14:00.362
FROM THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

03:14:00.428 --> 03:14:01.863
PENALTY.

03:14:01.930 --> 03:14:03.999
IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE THAT --

03:14:04.065 --> 03:14:06.201
CERTAIN -- RECIPIENTS OF THE

03:14:06.267 --> 03:14:07.602
SUBSIDIES RECONCILE THEIR

03:14:07.669 --> 03:14:08.603
SUBSIDIES THROUGH THE STATE

03:14:08.670 --> 03:14:09.838
INCOME TAX SYSTEM WHEN THE

03:14:09.904 --> 03:14:12.474
RECONCILIATION IS SMALL.

03:14:12.540 --> 03:14:14.275
AND IT WOULD REQUIRE -- THE

03:14:14.342 --> 03:14:15.944
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO REPORT

03:14:16.011 --> 03:14:17.312
CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE

03:14:17.379 --> 03:14:18.613
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO

03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:20.582
PAY THE PENALTY.

03:14:20.648 --> 03:14:22.083
IT WOULD SUNSET A PROPOSED

03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:22.784
EXEMPTION FROM THE

03:14:22.851 --> 03:14:24.085
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT

03:14:24.152 --> 03:14:25.420
AFTER THREE YEARS.

03:14:25.487 --> 03:14:27.155
AND FINALLY THE SENATE ACTION

03:14:27.222 --> 03:14:28.690
WOULD NOT EXEMPT FROM THE

03:14:28.757 --> 03:14:29.791
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY

03:14:29.858 --> 03:14:31.026
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

03:14:31.092 --> 03:14:32.160
ENROLLED IN.

03:14:32.227 --> 03:14:33.828
HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY IS

03:14:33.895 --> 03:14:35.163
WHICH ARE ORGANIZATIONS.

03:14:35.230 --> 03:14:37.265
THAT ALLOW MEMBERS TO SHARE SOME

03:14:37.332 --> 03:14:38.967
OF EACH OTHER'S MEDICAL COSTS

03:14:39.034 --> 03:14:40.402
BUT ARE NOT REGULATED BY THE

03:14:40.468 --> 03:14:40.602
STATE.

03:14:40.668 --> 03:14:42.070
AS INSURANCE.

03:14:42.137 --> 03:14:44.105
THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE LOWER

03:14:44.172 --> 03:14:45.407
AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR SUBSIDIES

03:14:45.473 --> 03:14:46.508
THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE

03:14:46.574 --> 03:14:48.076
GOVERNOR IN.

03:14:48.143 --> 03:14:49.077
NINETEEN TWENTY BUT REJECTED THE

03:14:49.144 --> 03:14:51.079
PROPOSED LANGUAGE I'M IN FAVOR

03:14:51.146 --> 03:14:52.714
OF CONSIDERING SUCH CHANGES

03:14:52.781 --> 03:14:54.816
THROUGH THE POLICY BILL PROCESS.

03:14:54.883 --> 03:14:56.918
I'M BRIEFLY SIMILAR COMMENTS ON

03:14:56.985 --> 03:14:59.587
THIS WE'VE PREVIOUSLY NOTED THAT --

03:14:59.654 --> 03:15:01.122
THE STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

03:15:01.189 --> 03:15:02.590
MERIT SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.

03:15:02.657 --> 03:15:04.826
AS A COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO

03:15:04.893 --> 03:15:06.327
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED

03:15:06.394 --> 03:15:08.163
RESIDENTS IN THE STATE.

03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:09.464
AND WETHINK IT MAKES SENSE TO

03:15:09.531 --> 03:15:10.598
CONSIDER A STATE INDIVIDUAL

03:15:10.665 --> 03:15:12.600
MANDATE PENALTY WITH --

03:15:12.667 --> 03:15:15.637
SUBSIDIES AT THE SAME TIME. TO

03:15:15.703 --> 03:15:16.805
OFFSET SOME OF THE NEGATIVE

03:15:16.871 --> 03:15:18.006
IMPACTS OF THE OF THE MANDATE

03:15:18.073 --> 03:15:19.307
PENALTY.

03:15:19.374 --> 03:15:21.376
HOWEVER WE HAVE FOUND THAT

03:15:21.443 --> 03:15:22.977
LIMITING FUNDING FOR THE

03:15:23.044 --> 03:15:24.712
INSURANCE SUBSIDIES TO THE PARA

03:15:24.779 --> 03:15:25.213
COUNTY REVENUES COULD BE

03:15:25.280 --> 03:15:27.649
PROBLEMATIC -- SINCE THE GOAL OF

03:15:27.715 --> 03:15:29.617
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AS A

03:15:29.684 --> 03:15:31.019
DETERRENT AGAINST FOR GOING.

03:15:31.086 --> 03:15:32.520
ON INSURANCE COVERAGE IS AT ODDS

03:15:32.587 --> 03:15:33.688
WITH THE GOAL OF RAISING

03:15:33.755 --> 03:15:35.623
REVENUES FOR THE SUBSIDIES.

03:15:35.690 --> 03:15:37.358
AND FINALLY WE FIND THAT THE

03:15:37.425 --> 03:15:38.660
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SUNSET

03:15:38.726 --> 03:15:41.296
THE SUBSIDIES CREATES BUDGETARY

03:15:41.362 --> 03:15:41.830
PRESSURES TO CONTINUE THE

03:15:41.896 --> 03:15:44.666
SUBSIDIES -- IN LATER YEARS.

03:15:44.732 --> 03:15:45.900
THE ASSEMBLY IS APPROACH OF

03:15:45.967 --> 03:15:48.336
DEFERRING ENACTMENT OF LANGUAGE

03:15:48.403 --> 03:15:49.604
TO THE POLICY PROCESS WOULD

03:15:49.671 --> 03:15:51.473
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TIME. FOR THE

03:15:51.539 --> 03:15:52.273
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THESE

03:15:52.340 --> 03:15:54.642
ISSUES.

03:15:54.709 --> 03:15:55.777
HOWEVER THERE ARE REASONS TO

03:15:55.844 --> 03:15:57.612
PURSUE MORE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON

03:15:57.679 --> 03:15:59.280
THESE POLICIES PARTICULARLY IF A

03:15:59.347 --> 03:16:00.882
JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY

03:16:00.949 --> 03:16:02.083

03:16:02.150 --> 03:16:03.451
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND THE

03:16:03.518 --> 03:16:04.452
SUBSIDIES.

03:16:04.519 --> 03:16:05.720
AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IS

03:16:05.787 --> 03:16:07.322
DESIRED.

03:16:07.388 --> 03:16:08.823
AND THE REASON IS THAT THESE

03:16:08.890 --> 03:16:10.058
POLICIES ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT

03:16:10.125 --> 03:16:11.659
THE REST MIX IN THE INDIVIDUAL

SET AND THOSE RATES -- TYPICALLY

03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:22.504
WOULD NEED TO BE SET BY JULY --

TWENTY NINETEEN AS A RESULT THE

03:16:23.204 --> 03:16:24.539
LÏNG ACKMAN OF LANGUAGE TO

03:16:28.576 --> 03:16:30.812
CHALLENGING TO GET THOSE RATES

03:16:30.879 --> 03:16:33.181
SET AND GET ALL OF THESE

03:16:33.248 --> 03:16:36.251

NOT ELIO FERNANDO.

03:16:41.923 --> 03:16:43.358
PEOPLE MAKE THREE BRIEF POINTS

03:16:43.424 --> 03:16:45.927
FIRST -- FOR SEVERAL THE REASONS

03:16:45.994 --> 03:16:47.262
THAT THE LA -- JUST MENTIONED

03:16:47.328 --> 03:16:48.963
THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES VERY

03:16:49.030 --> 03:16:50.765
STRONGLY THAT THIS SHOULD TAKE

03:16:50.832 --> 03:16:52.100
PLACE TO BE CONSIDERED IN TERMS

03:16:52.167 --> 03:16:53.434
OF THE IN AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

03:16:53.501 --> 03:16:54.369
AND SUBSIDIES.

03:16:54.435 --> 03:16:55.603
PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS

03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:58.006
BECAUSE AS LA -- GENOCIDE IF WE

03:16:58.072 --> 03:16:59.374
WANT TO START THIS PROGRAM BY

03:16:59.440 --> 03:17:01.242
JULY BY JANUARY FIRST OF NEXT

03:17:01.309 --> 03:17:03.011
YEAR COVER CALIFORNIA REALLY

03:17:03.077 --> 03:17:05.346
NEED CERTAINTY BY NEXT MONTH

03:17:05.413 --> 03:17:13.054
JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE

03:17:13.121 --> 03:17:13.755
MATCH UP AS BEST AS WE COULD

03:17:13.821 --> 03:17:14.422
ESTIMATE.

03:17:14.489 --> 03:17:17.392
THE MONEY RAISED BY THE MANDATE

03:17:17.458 --> 03:17:19.561
PENALTY -- WITH THE SUBSIDIES

03:17:19.627 --> 03:17:20.562
THAT WE ARE SPENDING AND SO WE

03:17:20.628 --> 03:17:23.064
BELIEVE THAT CHANGES BEYOND THAT

03:17:23.131 --> 03:17:24.332
PROCESS WHETHER IT'S DIRECT

03:17:24.399 --> 03:17:26.668
ADDITIONAL FUNDS OR WHETHER IT'S

03:17:26.734 --> 03:17:28.069
CHANGES TO ELIGIBILITY OR

03:17:28.136 --> 03:17:29.404
EXEMPTIONS BEYOND WHAT THE

03:17:29.470 --> 03:17:30.772
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED.

03:17:30.838 --> 03:17:32.607
COULD RESULT IN COST PRESSURES

03:17:32.674 --> 03:17:33.841
ON THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE

03:17:33.908 --> 03:17:35.009
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO

03:17:35.076 --> 03:17:36.077
ABSORB OR WOULD HAVE TO TRADE

03:17:36.144 --> 03:17:37.946
OFF AGAINST OTHER PROGRAMS WE DO

03:17:38.012 --> 03:17:39.347
BELIEVE THAT THAT OFFSET

03:17:39.414 --> 03:17:40.415
PRINCIPLE.

03:17:40.481 --> 03:17:42.217
IS IMPORTANT HERE AND THEN THE

03:17:42.283 --> 03:17:43.318
FINAL POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE

03:17:43.384 --> 03:17:46.054
IS THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM AND WE

03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:47.689
ARE THE FIRST STATE IN THE

03:17:47.755 --> 03:17:49.557
NATION IN TERMS OF THIS LEVEL OF

03:17:49.624 --> 03:17:50.925
SUBSIDIES THAT WE'RE PROPOSING.

03:17:50.992 --> 03:17:52.627
AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT AN ANNUAL

03:17:52.694 --> 03:17:54.862
REVIEW OF HOW THIS PROGRAM IS

03:17:54.929 --> 03:17:56.431
STRUCTURED IN DESIGNED IS

03:17:56.497 --> 03:17:57.565
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:17:57.632 --> 03:17:58.833
GET THIS RIGHT BOTH IN THE FIRST

03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:02.103
YEAR BUT ALSO IN THE SECOND AND

03:18:02.170 --> 03:18:04.239
THIRD YEARS OF THIS PROGRAM.

03:18:04.305 --> 03:18:05.573
I WOULD CERTAINLY IS A SUPPORT

03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:06.874
THE COUNCIL OF ANNUAL REVIEW I

03:18:06.941 --> 03:18:08.042
AGREE.

SO.

03:18:19.153 --> 03:18:20.154
I GUESS WE COULD HAVE A

03:18:20.221 --> 03:18:21.289
DISCUSSION ON WHETHER THE

03:18:21.356 --> 03:18:23.091
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS WORKING

03:18:23.157 --> 03:18:25.593
OR WHETHER PREMIUMS ARE.

03:18:25.660 --> 03:18:27.195
DECLINING ARE LEVELING OUT ARE

03:18:27.262 --> 03:18:28.863

03:18:30.164 --> 03:18:31.232
WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS

03:18:31.299 --> 03:18:35.703
A TAX INCREASE -- I'M CONCERNED

03:18:35.770 --> 03:18:38.606
ABOUT SOME PROPOSALS TO TRY TO

03:18:38.673 --> 03:18:41.276
ELIMINATE CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS.

03:18:41.342 --> 03:18:42.910

03:23:32.199 --> 03:23:33.434
OUTDATED?

03:23:33.501 --> 03:23:36.170
COMPLEX AND NON TRANSPARENT RATE

03:23:36.237 --> 03:23:38.940
SETTING PROCESS CURRENTLY --

03:23:39.006 --> 03:23:41.208
IT'S A IT'S SOME OF THE TARGETED

03:23:41.275 --> 03:23:42.910
BUDGET SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:23:42.977 --> 03:23:44.211
ENACTED IN RECENT YEARS HAVE

03:23:44.278 --> 03:23:46.581
FURTHER COMPLICATED THE WAY THAT

03:23:46.647 --> 03:23:47.915
RATES ARE SET [inaudible]

03:23:47.982 --> 03:23:49.717
AND IMPROVE.

03:23:49.784 --> 03:23:50.651
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

03:23:50.718 --> 03:23:52.320
ESTABLISHED METHODS FOR SETTING

03:23:52.386 --> 03:23:53.854
RATES SOME OF THESE BUDGET

03:23:53.921 --> 03:23:55.289
SOLUTIONS HAVE LED TO A

03:23:55.356 --> 03:23:56.557
SITUATION WHERE THOSE

03:23:56.624 --> 03:23:58.593
ESTABLISHED METHODS ARE JUST ON

03:23:58.659 --> 03:23:59.894
PAPER THOSE ARE REALLY THE

03:23:59.961 --> 03:24:01.395
METHODS THAT WE USE ANY LONGER

03:24:01.462 --> 03:24:02.463
TO SET THE RATES?

03:24:02.530 --> 03:24:03.731
AND THERE ARE ALSO SOME

03:24:03.798 --> 03:24:05.733
SIGNIFICANT -- AND SOMEWHAT

03:24:05.800 --> 03:24:08.469
ARBITRARY INEQUITIES BETWEEN THE

03:24:08.536 --> 03:24:11.372
RATES PAID TO PROVIDERS WHO ARE

03:24:11.439 --> 03:24:12.873
OTHERWISE SIMILAR.

03:24:12.940 --> 03:24:15.376
SO THIS A PROBLEM REALLY IN THE

03:24:15.443 --> 03:24:17.178
RATE SETTING PROCESS IN THE DDS

03:24:17.244 --> 03:24:18.379
SYSTEM RESULTED IN THE

03:24:18.446 --> 03:24:20.715
LEGISLATURE CALLING FOR A RATE

03:24:20.781 --> 03:24:23.150
STUDY -- THIS WAS A RESULT OF

03:24:23.217 --> 03:24:26.420
SPECIAL SESSION LEGISLATION IN

03:24:26.487 --> 03:24:26.921
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE

03:24:26.988 --> 03:24:28.122
LEGISLATION PROVIDED THREE

03:24:28.189 --> 03:24:29.624
MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO

03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:31.092
THE DEPARTMENT TO CONDUCT THE

03:24:31.158 --> 03:24:32.393
STUDY.

03:24:32.460 --> 03:24:34.428
AND THE STUDY WAS DUE ON MARCH

03:24:34.495 --> 03:24:36.397
FIRST.

03:24:36.464 --> 03:24:37.865
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO -- JUST

03:24:37.932 --> 03:24:39.300
IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR MARCH

03:24:39.367 --> 03:24:40.768
FIFTEENTH DDS AND ITS

03:24:40.835 --> 03:24:42.870
CONSULTANTS SUBMITTED A DRAFT

03:24:42.937 --> 03:24:46.307
RATE STUDY REPORT INCLUDING THE

03:24:46.374 --> 03:24:49.210
THE PROPOSED RATE SETTING MODELS

03:24:49.276 --> 03:24:50.311
FOR EACH OF THE SERVICE

03:24:50.378 --> 03:24:50.611
CATEGORIES.

03:24:50.678 --> 03:24:52.813
AND BUT ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS

03:24:52.880 --> 03:24:54.382
FROM THIS STUDY IS IT SUGGESTED

03:24:54.448 --> 03:24:56.117
THAT THE SYSTEM WAS UNDERFUNDED

03:24:56.183 --> 03:24:57.451
BY ONE POINT NINE BILLION

03:24:57.518 --> 03:24:59.020
DOLLARS ONE POINT TWO GENERAL

03:24:59.086 --> 03:25:00.121
FUND.

03:25:00.187 --> 03:25:01.455
A RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S

03:25:01.522 --> 03:25:03.391
PROPOSED TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

03:25:03.457 --> 03:25:06.927
BUDGET -- SO.

03:25:06.994 --> 03:25:08.896
THE GOVERNOR SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

03:25:08.963 --> 03:25:11.932
EACH APPROVED PROPOSALS FOR

03:25:11.999 --> 03:25:12.500
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THAT

03:25:12.566 --> 03:25:14.101
RESPOND IN PART TO THE RATE

03:25:14.168 --> 03:25:16.270
STUDY BUT ALSO -- TO SOME OF THE

03:25:16.337 --> 03:25:17.905
CHALLENGES THAT THE SYSTEM HAS

03:25:17.972 --> 03:25:21.242
BEEN FACING IN RECENT YEARS SO.

03:25:21.308 --> 03:25:22.543
I'LL DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCES

03:25:22.610 --> 03:25:24.645
BETWEEN WHAT HAS BEEN APPROVED

03:25:24.712 --> 03:25:26.280
BY A PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR

03:25:26.347 --> 03:25:27.615
AND THEN APPROVED BY THE SENATE

03:25:27.682 --> 03:25:29.717
AND ASSEMBLY IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

03:25:29.784 --> 03:25:30.951
TWO OF THE HAND OUT.

03:25:31.018 --> 03:25:33.487
WE HAVE A A TABLE THAT SORT OF

03:25:33.554 --> 03:25:35.089
DOCUMENTS THESE DIFFERENCES.

03:25:35.156 --> 03:25:37.692
SO THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED

03:25:37.758 --> 03:25:39.593
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION

03:25:39.660 --> 03:25:42.496
DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY THIS

03:25:42.563 --> 03:25:44.465
IS A HALF YOUR COST BECAUSE THE

03:25:44.532 --> 03:25:45.666
RATE INCREASE THESE ARE.

03:25:45.733 --> 03:25:49.236
FOR A TARGETED RATE INCREASES IN

03:25:49.303 --> 03:25:50.538
FOUR DIFFERENT SERVICE AREAS

03:25:50.604 --> 03:25:51.706
THIS REPRESENTS A HALF YOUR

03:25:51.772 --> 03:25:53.174
COSTS BECAUSE THE RATE INCREASES

03:25:53.240 --> 03:25:56.277
WOULD BEGIN JANUARY FIRST.

03:25:56.343 --> 03:25:57.278
TWENTY TWENTY N. IT'S IMPORTANT

03:25:57.344 --> 03:25:58.913
TO NOTE THAT THIS INCLUDES A

03:25:58.979 --> 03:26:00.715
SMALL AMOUNT -- FOR SOME OF THE

03:26:00.781 --> 03:26:02.116
RATES THAT ARE IN THE DEPARTMENT

03:26:02.183 --> 03:26:03.951
OF REHABILITATION SYSTEM THAT

03:26:04.018 --> 03:26:06.220
CONFORM. TO THE RATE LEVELS IN

03:26:06.287 --> 03:26:09.290
THE DDS SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY FOR

03:26:09.356 --> 03:26:09.990
SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT.

03:26:10.057 --> 03:26:12.326
THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSED TO

03:26:12.393 --> 03:26:15.062
SUSPEND -- A POLICY CALLED THE

03:26:15.129 --> 03:26:17.198
UNIFORM HOLIDAY POLICY SCHEDULE

03:26:17.264 --> 03:26:18.799
RATHER THAT -- ESSENTIALLY

03:26:18.866 --> 03:26:22.336
PROHIBITS -- PAYMENT FOR

03:26:22.403 --> 03:26:24.472
SERVICES ON FOURTEEN SAID DAYS

03:26:24.538 --> 03:26:26.474
PER YEAR -- BOTH OF THESE

03:26:26.540 --> 03:26:27.808
PROPOSALS BY THE GOVERNOR WOULD

03:26:27.875 --> 03:26:34.181
SUNSET ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST.

03:26:34.248 --> 03:26:36.050
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE SENATE --

03:26:40.354 --> 03:26:42.189
THE SUNSET.

03:26:42.256 --> 03:26:45.493
THE SENATE ALSO APPROVED -- AN

03:26:45.559 --> 03:26:47.495
ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASE -- IT

03:26:47.561 --> 03:26:49.029
SAID THAT IT WANTED TO PROVIDE

03:26:49.096 --> 03:26:50.364
AN ACROSS THE BOARD RATE

03:26:50.431 --> 03:26:52.199
INCREASE FOR ALL SERVICE

03:26:52.266 --> 03:26:54.101
PROVIDERS NOT JUST THE FOR THAT

03:26:54.168 --> 03:26:55.436
WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S.

03:26:55.503 --> 03:26:56.804
BUDGET AD ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT

03:26:56.871 --> 03:26:58.439
WOULD DO IS IT WOULD PROVIDE 8%

03:26:58.506 --> 03:27:00.674
ACROSS THE BOARD. TO ALL SERVICE

03:27:00.741 --> 03:27:02.209
PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN

03:27:02.276 --> 03:27:03.611
THE ONES THAT WERE PART OF THE

03:27:03.677 --> 03:27:06.180
GOVERNOR'S OF A PROPOSAL MAKE

03:27:06.247 --> 03:27:07.681
END UP GETTING AN ADDITIONAL

03:27:07.748 --> 03:27:08.716
INCREASE.

03:27:08.783 --> 03:27:11.585
IN IN HIS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

03:27:11.652 --> 03:27:12.953
PROPOSAL.

03:27:13.020 --> 03:27:14.588
THIS WOULD COME AT A COST OF

03:27:14.655 --> 03:27:16.524
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION

03:27:16.590 --> 03:27:19.160
GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY

03:27:19.226 --> 03:27:19.960
AND AGAIN THAT WOULD BE A HALF

03:27:20.027 --> 03:27:21.195
YOUR COSTS OF THE ANNUAL IS

03:27:21.262 --> 03:27:22.797
COSTS WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR

03:27:22.863 --> 03:27:24.899
HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND --

03:27:24.965 --> 03:27:25.966
I'M GONNA JUST GO THROUGH THE

03:27:26.033 --> 03:27:27.735
RATE INCREASE DIFFERENCES AND

03:27:27.802 --> 03:27:28.936
THEN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

03:27:29.003 --> 03:27:31.138
OTHER -- AS THINGS THAT WERE

03:27:31.205 --> 03:27:33.107

IT COMES TO READING CREASES THE

ASSEMBLY APPROVED TO THE AMOUNT

03:27:38.813 --> 03:27:40.681
THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD PROPOSED

03:27:40.748 --> 03:27:42.483
THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION -- BUT

03:27:42.550 --> 03:27:44.518
INSTEAD OF TARGETING IT WOULD

03:27:44.585 --> 03:27:46.187
APPLY IT ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO

03:27:46.253 --> 03:27:49.890

03:27:49.957 --> 03:27:51.592
ACROSS THE BOARD RATE INCREASE.

03:27:51.659 --> 03:27:53.460
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER

REJECTED THE THE SUNSET THAT HAD

03:27:58.933 --> 03:28:00.167
BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR.

03:28:00.234 --> 03:28:01.268
THEY'RE ALSO IN A NUMBER OF

03:28:01.335 --> 03:28:04.104
OTHER POLICY CHANGES -- THAT THE

03:28:04.171 --> 03:28:05.773
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY TOOK ACTION

03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:08.409
ON SO I'M I'M GOING TO JUST NAME

03:28:14.248 --> 03:28:16.116
DETAIL THAT YOU WOULD LIKE.

03:28:16.183 --> 03:28:18.118
BUT THE SENATE APPROVED --

03:28:18.185 --> 03:28:19.253
FIXING WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE

03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:21.021
STATE MINIMUM WAGE QUIRK THAT

03:28:21.088 --> 03:28:23.290
COMES AT A COST OF NINE MILLION

03:28:23.357 --> 03:28:24.058
GENERAL FUND.

03:28:24.124 --> 03:28:28.362
IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND WOULD BE --

03:28:28.429 --> 03:28:29.964
REAL IT WOULD FUNDS THAT --

03:28:30.030 --> 03:28:31.565
INCREASES STARTING WITH THE

03:28:31.632 --> 03:28:33.968
JANUARY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY

03:28:34.034 --> 03:28:36.203
STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE.

03:28:36.270 --> 03:28:37.238
BOTH HE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

03:28:37.304 --> 03:28:39.206
VOTED TO PERMANENTLY REPEAL THE

03:28:39.273 --> 03:28:40.774
UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE RATHER

03:28:40.841 --> 03:28:43.210
THAN TEMPORARILY SUSPENDING IT.

03:28:43.277 --> 03:28:44.879
THAT WOULD COME AT A COST OF

03:28:44.945 --> 03:28:46.480
THIRTY POINT ONE MILLION ON AN

03:28:46.547 --> 03:28:48.849
ANNUAL BASIS FROM THE GENERAL

03:28:48.916 --> 03:28:49.717
FUND.

03:28:49.783 --> 03:28:50.684
BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

03:28:50.751 --> 03:28:52.253
VOTED TO PERMANENTLY REPEAL

03:28:52.319 --> 03:28:53.621
WHAT'S CALLED THE HALF DAY

03:28:53.687 --> 03:28:55.723
BILLING POLICY THIS IS HAS A

03:28:55.789 --> 03:28:57.658
RELATIVELY MODEST COST OF ONE

03:28:57.725 --> 03:28:58.826
POINT SIX MILLION.

03:28:58.893 --> 03:29:00.394
FROM THE GENERAL FUND ON AN

03:29:00.461 --> 03:29:03.063
ANNUAL BASIS.

03:29:03.130 --> 03:29:06.000
AND THE BOTH OF THOSE THE

03:29:06.066 --> 03:29:07.301
UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE.

03:29:07.368 --> 03:29:08.068
PARDON ME AND THEY HAVE TO A

03:29:08.135 --> 03:29:09.803
BILLING POLICY WERE BULLS

03:29:09.870 --> 03:29:11.839
ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE

03:29:11.906 --> 03:29:14.008
RECESSION AS A BUDGET SOLUTION.

03:29:14.074 --> 03:29:15.409
SO IN SOME WAYS THIS IS SORT OF

03:29:15.476 --> 03:29:17.044
RESTORING SOME FUNDING TO THE

03:29:17.111 --> 03:29:19.980
SYSTEM -- BUT THE THE SENATE AND

03:29:20.047 --> 03:29:21.682
ASSEMBLY ALSO RESTORED CERTAIN

03:29:21.749 --> 03:29:23.784
BENEFITS THAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED

03:29:23.851 --> 03:29:25.452
DURING THE RECESSION.

03:29:25.519 --> 03:29:27.121
SO SPECIFICALLY THE SENATE

03:29:27.187 --> 03:29:28.956
APPROVED RESTORATION OF SOCIAL

03:29:29.023 --> 03:29:30.991

GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY

03:29:35.262 --> 03:29:36.263
THAT WOULD BE SORT OF A PARTIAL

03:29:36.330 --> 03:29:37.932
COST AS IT RAMPS UP.

03:29:37.998 --> 03:29:39.967
THE FULL ANNUALIZED COST WOULD

03:29:40.034 --> 03:29:41.769
BE FOUR POINT NINE GENERAL FUND.

03:29:41.835 --> 03:29:42.636
FOUR POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL

03:29:42.703 --> 03:29:44.605

CAR TWENTY COSTS THERE IS

03:29:57.284 --> 03:29:58.152
FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION

03:29:58.218 --> 03:29:59.520
GENERAL FUND AND THAT WOULD RAMP

03:29:59.586 --> 03:30:01.789
UP TO TWENTY SEVEN POINT THREE

03:30:01.855 --> 03:30:02.890
MILLION GENERAL FUND.

03:30:02.957 --> 03:30:04.725
FINALLY -- BOTH THE SENATE AND

03:30:04.792 --> 03:30:06.560
ASSEMBLY APPROVED PLACE HOLDER

03:30:06.627 --> 03:30:07.962
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD

03:30:08.028 --> 03:30:10.130
REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO SUBMIT

03:30:10.197 --> 03:30:12.066
A RATE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION

03:30:12.132 --> 03:30:15.235
PLAN -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

03:30:15.302 --> 03:30:17.905
GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY

03:30:17.972 --> 03:30:19.473
ONE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THE ONLY

03:30:19.540 --> 03:30:20.541
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

COMMON IS THAT THEY EACH ATTEMPT

03:30:55.042 --> 03:30:56.310

03:30:56.377 --> 03:30:58.912
PHYSICAL RELIEF TO SERVICE

BROADER ISSUE OF RATE REFORM --

03:31:08.122 --> 03:31:09.990
THE DEPARTMENT SAID IN BUDGET

03:31:10.057 --> 03:31:11.358
SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS THAT IT

03:31:11.425 --> 03:31:13.360

OVER THE SUMMER ABOUT HOW TO DO

03:31:14.628 --> 03:31:16.563
THAT THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE

03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:18.365

A PLAN FOR REFORM IMPLEMENTATION --

03:31:29.843 --> 03:31:31.712
IN OUR VIEW.

03:31:31.779 --> 03:31:33.280
THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS.

03:31:33.347 --> 03:31:34.615
IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT THE

03:31:51.732 --> 03:31:54.835
INTERIM -- STEP TOWARD.

03:31:54.902 --> 03:31:57.471
FULL RATE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION

03:31:57.538 --> 03:31:58.906

ESTABLISHING A TRANSPARENT AND

03:32:00.607 --> 03:32:03.043
LOGICAL RATE SETTING PROCESS.

03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:04.745

COULD HAVE INTERPRETED THE

03:34:17.744 --> 03:34:18.845
LANGUAGE BUT I WOULD HAVE

03:34:18.912 --> 03:34:20.547

FUNDING LEVEL SUSTAINABLE WHICH

03:34:26.687 --> 03:34:27.955
IS PROBABLY A RATE REFORM

03:34:28.021 --> 03:34:30.190
PROPOSALS SO HERE WE ARE.

03:34:30.257 --> 03:34:33.727

HAVE IT YET THAT WE PUT IN SOME

03:34:36.964 --> 03:34:38.232

I'M KIND OF LIKE -- YOU KNOW

03:34:41.568 --> 03:34:43.303
MAYBE WE HAVE TO DO THAT I KNOW

03:34:43.370 --> 03:34:45.272
IT'S DIFFERENT WHAT YOU BUT AND

03:34:45.339 --> 03:34:46.940
IT'S MORE SPECIFIC.

03:34:47.007 --> 03:34:48.775
BUT I'M EXPRESSING A FRUSTRATION

03:34:48.842 --> 03:34:55.716
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE EVEN IF WE

03:34:55.782 --> 03:34:57.451
CROSS THE TEASE IN DOT THE ICE.

03:34:57.517 --> 03:34:58.685
WE MAY NOT STILL GET WHAT WE

03:34:58.752 --> 03:35:00.220
NEED FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

03:35:00.287 --> 03:35:02.055
DEPARTMENT'S OWN AND WE'RE TO

03:35:02.122 --> 03:35:03.557

ONLY GIVEN TO RATE INCREASES

03:35:11.098 --> 03:35:13.267
OVER TWENTY YEARS.

03:35:13.333 --> 03:35:16.570
THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF ESTIMATES

03:35:16.637 --> 03:35:19.439
THAT THIS THE NEED IS.

03:35:19.506 --> 03:35:21.475
THE THAT WERE BEHIND IN TERMS OF

03:35:21.541 --> 03:35:23.810
DEFINING NEED BY OVER ONE POINT

03:35:23.877 --> 03:35:29.883
EIGHT BILLION -- AND I I FEEL

03:35:29.950 --> 03:35:31.385
LIKE THIS IS A POPULATION.

03:35:31.451 --> 03:35:33.086
THIS REALLY IS LIKE OUR FOSTER

03:35:33.153 --> 03:35:34.621
KIDS LIKE A NUMBER OF OTHERS

03:35:34.688 --> 03:35:36.089
THIS IS A POPULATION THAT WERE

03:35:36.156 --> 03:35:38.058
RESPONSIBLE FOR IN THAT WE NEED

03:35:38.125 --> 03:35:41.962
TO ASSIST IN WERE FAILING -- I

03:35:42.029 --> 03:35:43.530
WOULD SUPPORT THE SENATE'S

03:35:43.597 --> 03:35:44.498
PROPOSAL.

03:35:44.564 --> 03:35:46.833
A A I KNOW IT DOES NOT ANSWER

03:35:46.900 --> 03:35:49.636
THE LONG TERM AND WE POTENTIALLY

03:35:49.703 --> 03:35:52.639
SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT DE LA

03:35:52.706 --> 03:35:53.573
ALWAYS RECOMMENDING IN TERMS OF

03:35:53.640 --> 03:35:55.609
VERY SPECIFIC WORDING FOR THE

03:35:55.676 --> 03:35:57.444
DEPARTMENT TO COME BACK WITH.

03:35:57.511 --> 03:35:58.045
BUT I FEEL LIKE WHAT THEY'VE

03:35:58.111 --> 03:36:00.180
COME BACK SO FAR WITH THE THINGS

03:36:00.247 --> 03:36:08.588
WE VAST IS VERY INADEQUATE.

03:36:08.655 --> 03:36:10.424
THANK YOU TO STORM.

03:36:10.490 --> 03:36:11.792
I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WHEN

03:36:11.858 --> 03:36:15.562
WE FOR STARTED THE OVERALL --

03:36:15.629 --> 03:36:18.165
PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CONFERENCE

03:36:18.231 --> 03:36:19.599
AND JUST TO JUST KIND OF WANTED

03:36:19.666 --> 03:36:22.035
TO REITERATE -- FOR US WE ARE

03:36:22.102 --> 03:36:24.571
VERY CONCERNED WITH THE SUNSET

03:36:24.638 --> 03:36:25.939
PROVISIONS THE MINISTRATION.

03:36:26.006 --> 03:36:28.975
HANDED THEM WE THOUGHT THAT --

03:36:29.042 --> 03:36:30.444
ANA HE'S WERE NOT WHAT I'M

03:36:30.510 --> 03:36:31.244
EXPENDITURES.

03:36:31.311 --> 03:36:32.879
THAT THE THE RATE INCREASES

03:36:32.946 --> 03:36:35.282
WOULD BE USED TO CALL HIGHER

03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:36.683
INDIVIDUALS.

03:36:36.750 --> 03:36:38.118
THAT THESE WOULD BE JOBS THAT

03:36:38.185 --> 03:36:41.054
WOULD -- NEED TO BE -- PLACE

03:36:41.121 --> 03:36:43.156
WITH INDIVIDUALS AND THAT JUST.

03:36:43.223 --> 03:36:44.991
TAKING THE MONEY AWAY IN TWO

03:36:45.058 --> 03:36:45.959
YEARS JUST MEANT THOSE

03:36:46.026 --> 03:36:46.760
INDIVIDUAL GET LAID OFF I DON'T

03:36:46.827 --> 03:36:47.361
KNOW IF.

03:36:47.427 --> 03:36:49.096
LA -- COULD SORT OF JUST COMMENT

03:36:49.162 --> 03:36:55.402
ON THAT -- OF THE THIRD SET AND

03:36:55.469 --> 03:36:55.836
THEN GO BACK TO THE

03:36:55.902 --> 03:36:57.871
ADMINISTRATION.

03:36:57.938 --> 03:36:59.306
YES -- WE WERE VERY CONCERNED TO

03:36:59.373 --> 03:37:00.240
SEE THE SUNSET PROPOSALS AS WELL

03:37:00.307 --> 03:37:01.508
BECAUSE THESE AE REALLY ONGOING

03:37:01.575 --> 03:37:03.543
SERVICES AND ONE OF THE THE

03:37:03.610 --> 03:37:07.147
RATIONALES -- FOR TARGETING FOR

03:37:07.214 --> 03:37:08.115
EXAMPLE.

03:37:08.181 --> 03:37:09.783
I'LL JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE ONE OF

03:37:09.850 --> 03:37:11.451
THE REASONS THE ADMINISTRATION

03:37:11.518 --> 03:37:13.587
GAVE FOR TARGETING RATE

03:37:13.653 --> 03:37:16.690
INCREASES TO RESIDENTIAL CARE

03:37:16.757 --> 03:37:19.159
PROVIDERS WAS THE NEED TO

03:37:19.226 --> 03:37:21.027
STABILIZE THE SYSTEM.

03:37:21.094 --> 03:37:22.362
OBVIOUSLY SEND SETTING THOSE

03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:23.997
RATE INCREASES K. COULD HAVE THE

03:37:24.064 --> 03:37:24.965
EFFECT OF DESTABILIZING THE

03:37:25.031 --> 03:37:29.069
SYSTEM.

03:37:29.136 --> 03:37:30.370
I THINK THE MAIN THING FOR THE

03:37:30.437 --> 03:37:31.938
ADMINISTRATION IS -- WE

03:37:32.005 --> 03:37:33.240
UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR BROADER

03:37:33.306 --> 03:37:35.575
REFORM AND SO WE ARE IN THE NEXT

03:37:35.642 --> 03:37:37.444
TWO YEARS UP BETWEEN NOW NEXT

03:37:37.511 --> 03:37:38.245
TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND ARE

03:37:38.311 --> 03:37:40.247
PROPOSED SUNSET WE WANT TO MAKE

03:37:40.313 --> 03:37:41.648
SURE THAT WE CONTINUE FORWARD ON

03:37:41.715 --> 03:37:44.618
THAT PATH.

03:37:44.684 --> 03:37:46.019
I MAKES.

03:37:46.086 --> 03:37:50.223
SENSE BUT I THINK IT'S AGAIN I

03:37:50.290 --> 03:37:51.291
DO IT DOCTOR'S RESPONSE TO MY

03:37:51.358 --> 03:37:51.825
EARLIER POINT WHICH IS.

03:37:51.892 --> 03:37:54.661
THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HIRE

03:37:54.728 --> 03:37:56.229
PEOPLE IF THEY THINK THE ONLY

03:37:56.296 --> 03:37:58.064
HAVE A JOB. FOR FOR TWO YEARS

03:37:58.131 --> 03:37:59.766
AND VERY TIGHT LABOR MARKETS

03:37:59.833 --> 03:38:00.734
PUSH WHEN PEOPLE.

03:38:00.801 --> 03:38:02.536
ARE GETTING PAID THAT MUCH TO

03:38:02.602 --> 03:38:03.603
WORK AT THESE.

03:38:03.670 --> 03:38:05.639
FACILITIES THAT IT IS MAKES IT

03:38:05.705 --> 03:38:07.607
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND COULD

03:38:07.674 --> 03:38:08.608
KICK IN.

03:38:08.675 --> 03:38:09.743
I'M NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF

03:38:09.810 --> 03:38:13.046
STABILIZATION THAT WE WOULD ALL

03:38:13.113 --> 03:38:13.513
LIKE TO SEE.

03:38:13.580 --> 03:38:15.382
ON I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION

03:38:15.449 --> 03:38:16.817
WAS IS -- THERE ARE OTHER

03:38:16.883 --> 03:38:20.187
DIFFERENT NEW PROPOSALS THAT ARE

03:38:20.253 --> 03:38:21.621
IN THE BUDGET WHY NOT SUNSET A

03:38:21.688 --> 03:38:23.023
NEW PROPOSAL RATHER THAN.

03:38:23.089 --> 03:38:26.293
SOMETHING THAT IS A A RATE

03:38:26.359 --> 03:38:29.329
INCREASE OF A LONG STANDING

03:38:29.396 --> 03:38:35.168
PROGRAM THAT WE'VE MADE.

03:38:35.235 --> 03:38:36.736
HAD A LONG COMMITMENT.

03:38:36.803 --> 03:38:37.337
TO I THINK THERE BECAUSE THIS

03:38:37.404 --> 03:38:38.405
RATE STUDY JUST CAME OUT IN

03:38:38.472 --> 03:38:39.172
MARCH SO JUST ABOUT TWO MONTHS

03:38:39.239 --> 03:38:40.440
AGO AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'LL

03:38:40.507 --> 03:38:40.974
BE IMPLEMENTED OVER TIME.%

03:38:41.041 --> 03:38:42.242
WE THOUGHT THIS WAS ONE OF THE

03:38:42.309 --> 03:38:45.111
AREAS WHERE IT IS MOST RIGHT FOR

03:38:45.178 --> 03:38:47.113
THAT KIND OF RETHINKING AND

03:38:47.180 --> 03:38:47.714
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING

03:38:47.781 --> 03:38:49.549
THINGS THE RIGHT WAY AND WE ARE

03:38:49.616 --> 03:38:50.750
COMMITTED WE KNOW IT'S ALWAYS

03:38:50.817 --> 03:38:52.118
HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS BUT TO

03:38:52.185 --> 03:38:54.554
BENDING THE COST CURVE IN TRYING

03:38:54.621 --> 03:38:54.855
TO GET MORE.

03:38:54.921 --> 03:39:01.328
WHILE SPENDING LESS.

03:39:01.394 --> 03:39:04.364
I KNOW IT'S LATE IN -- BUT I

03:39:04.431 --> 03:39:06.266
JUST FEEL LIKE I WANT TO JUMP ON

03:39:06.333 --> 03:39:09.803
A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THIS IS A

03:39:09.870 --> 03:39:11.471
NOT A BI PARTISAN BUT NINE NON

03:39:11.538 --> 03:39:13.273
PARTISAN ISSUE THINK ABOUT THE

03:39:13.340 --> 03:39:16.610
LETTERMAN ACT -- BUT IT'S

03:39:16.676 --> 03:39:18.612
EXCEPTIONALLY FRUSTRATING WE

03:39:18.678 --> 03:39:19.779
HAVE MORE REVENUE OF THAT'S COME

03:39:19.846 --> 03:39:21.181
INTO THE STATE BUDGET THIS YEAR

03:39:21.248 --> 03:39:24.150
THAN ANY -- THAT THEN IN HISTORY.

03:39:24.217 --> 03:39:27.354
AND YET THIS COMMUNITY.

03:39:27.420 --> 03:39:30.056
THE DD COMMUNITY SEEMS TO EVERY

03:39:30.123 --> 03:39:31.691
SINGLE YEAR.

03:39:31.758 --> 03:39:33.693
THE WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED WE GOT

03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:35.595
WE DO A STUDY WE FIND OUT YEAH

03:39:35.662 --> 03:39:37.063
THEY NEED MORE MONEY.

03:39:37.130 --> 03:39:39.366
AND THEN WE SAY ALL. TO DO MORE

03:39:39.432 --> 03:39:40.901
STUDIES WE ARE WITH A LITTLE BIT

03:39:40.967 --> 03:39:41.668
A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

03:39:41.735 --> 03:39:44.004
AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN

03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:46.606
WERE -- WHEN WERE PRIORITIZING?

03:39:46.673 --> 03:39:48.275
OUR RESOURCES WHY IN THE WORLD

03:39:48.341 --> 03:39:50.544
THIS COMMUNITY YEAR AFTER YEAR

03:39:50.610 --> 03:39:52.712
AFTER YEAR GETS THE SHORT END OF

03:39:52.779 --> 03:39:53.780
THE STICK.

03:39:53.847 --> 03:39:55.181
I I I DON'T I DON'T GET IT

03:39:55.248 --> 03:39:56.716
BECAUSE WHEN I LISTEN TO MY

03:39:56.783 --> 03:39:57.851
COLLEAGUES WHEN WE'RE WE'RE

03:39:57.918 --> 03:39:59.019
DEBATING THIS ON THE FLOOR AND

03:39:59.085 --> 03:40:01.054
COMMITTEE WE ALL SAY THAT WERE

03:40:01.121 --> 03:40:02.422
FOR THIS COMMUNITY.

03:40:02.489 --> 03:40:04.024
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE PROVIDERS

03:40:04.090 --> 03:40:06.493
OF THEIR IN MY IN MY DISTRICT --

03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:08.728
ARE ARE ARE ABOUT THE ABOUT DONE

03:40:08.795 --> 03:40:10.730
THERE ONLY CONTINUING ON BECAUSE

03:40:10.797 --> 03:40:12.899
THEY CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT THESE

03:40:12.966 --> 03:40:14.267
THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY'RE NOT

03:40:14.334 --> 03:40:15.402
GETTING PAID.

03:40:15.468 --> 03:40:17.003
ENOUGH THEY'RE DOING IT I'M OUT

03:40:17.070 --> 03:40:18.271
OF THE KINDNESS OF THEIR HEART

03:40:18.338 --> 03:40:20.173
BUT THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH WHEN DO

03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:21.841
WE IS THE STATE SAY OKAY IT'S

03:40:21.908 --> 03:40:23.643
OUR RESPONSIBILITY WE'VE GOT TO

03:40:23.710 --> 03:40:24.911
BE ABLE TO TO JUST THIS.

03:40:24.978 --> 03:40:26.246
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO STEP TO

03:40:26.313 --> 03:40:28.181
STEP UP -- I THINK IT'S A IT'S

03:40:28.248 --> 03:40:30.116
ABOUT TIME AND AGAIN I'VE THIS

03:40:30.183 --> 03:40:31.751
FRUSTRATION AMEND MY VOICE NEVER

03:40:31.818 --> 03:40:33.420
THIS FROM OTHERS THIS IS NOT A

03:40:33.486 --> 03:40:34.988
PARTISAN ISSUE ALL OF US SAYING

03:40:35.055 --> 03:40:36.423
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

03:40:36.489 --> 03:40:41.294
WHAT THE HANG UP IS MAYBE YOU

03:40:41.361 --> 03:40:43.530
CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON IT?

03:40:43.597 --> 03:40:44.431
SO THE ADMINISTRATION WE

03:40:44.497 --> 03:40:45.031
COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THIS IS

03:40:45.098 --> 03:40:46.533
NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN

03:40:46.600 --> 03:40:48.234
ISSUE AND I THINK I WOULD MAKE A

03:40:48.301 --> 03:40:49.603
TWO POINTS AND WE UNDERSTAND

03:40:49.669 --> 03:40:50.804
THAT SENATOR SKINNER SAID AS

03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:52.372
WELL THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE.

03:40:52.439 --> 03:40:53.373
ALL BEEN LOOKING AT FOR QUITE

03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:55.008
SOME TIME AND SO I THINK THE

03:40:55.075 --> 03:40:56.443
FIRST POINT IS THAT A HUNDRED

03:40:56.509 --> 03:40:58.044
MILLION DOLLARS CERTAINLY NOT

03:40:58.111 --> 03:40:59.446
ENOUGH TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE BUT

03:40:59.512 --> 03:41:01.214
IT'S ALSO NOT INSIGNIFICANT EVEN

03:41:01.281 --> 03:41:02.849
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CALIFORNIA

03:41:02.916 --> 03:41:04.384
BUDGET WE THINK THIS WILL MAKE A

03:41:04.451 --> 03:41:05.118
DIFFERENCE.

03:41:05.185 --> 03:41:05.785
WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME

03:41:05.852 --> 03:41:07.120
DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF HOW TO

03:41:07.187 --> 03:41:08.254
SPEND THAT MONEY BUT THE

03:41:08.321 --> 03:41:09.723
TARGETED APPROACH THAT THE

03:41:09.789 --> 03:41:11.791
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED WE

03:41:11.858 --> 03:41:13.059
THINK IT'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN

03:41:13.126 --> 03:41:14.594
IMPROVING ACCESS FOR THIS

03:41:14.661 --> 03:41:15.428
COMMUNITY.

03:41:15.495 --> 03:41:18.298
AND THEN THE SECOND POINT IS --

03:41:18.365 --> 03:41:19.366
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THE

03:41:19.432 --> 03:41:20.266
GOVERNOR OFTEN SAYS ACROSS

03:41:20.333 --> 03:41:21.801
ISSUES HE SAYS IT'S NOT JUST

03:41:21.868 --> 03:41:22.869
ABOUT RESOURCES BUT

03:41:22.936 --> 03:41:24.070
RESOURCEFULNESS AND OF COURSE

03:41:24.137 --> 03:41:25.572
YOU ALWAYS DO NEED RESOURCES AS

03:41:25.639 --> 03:41:27.140
WELL WHICH IS WHY WE'RE

03:41:27.207 --> 03:41:28.041
PROPOSING MORE MONEY.

03:41:28.108 --> 03:41:29.776
BUT THIS REFORM EFFORT AND

03:41:29.843 --> 03:41:31.011
FIGURING OUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY

03:41:31.077 --> 03:41:32.445
IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE

03:41:32.512 --> 03:41:33.046
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS RATE

03:41:33.113 --> 03:41:35.882
STUDY AND SEE HOW IN THESE FIRST

03:41:35.949 --> 03:41:36.783
TWO TWO AND A HALF YEARS.

03:41:36.850 --> 03:41:37.951
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING

03:41:38.018 --> 03:41:39.853
ADOPTED WHAT THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES

03:41:39.919 --> 03:41:41.254
ARE FOR PEOPLE WHAT IS THE

03:41:41.321 --> 03:41:42.422
FEEDBACK THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM

03:41:42.489 --> 03:41:44.090
FAMILIES WATER I THINK THIS IS

03:41:44.157 --> 03:41:45.925
THE NEXT ISSUE ON THE AGENDA BUT

03:41:45.992 --> 03:41:47.594
IN TERMS OF SOME THE OVERSIGHT

03:41:47.661 --> 03:41:49.195
FOR THESE ORIGINAL LETTERMAN --

03:41:49.262 --> 03:41:51.231
ACCENTORS DOES ALL NEED TO BE

03:41:51.297 --> 03:41:52.599
PART OF THE CONVERSATION SO

03:41:52.666 --> 03:41:53.700
WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSED ON THE

03:41:53.767 --> 03:41:55.368
MONEY WE'RE GONNA BE OBVIOUSLY

03:41:55.435 --> 03:41:56.069
HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:41:56.136 --> 03:41:57.637
FINANCE CLOSELY TRACKING THE

03:41:57.704 --> 03:41:59.339
MULTI YEAR FORECAST AND THAT'S

03:41:59.406 --> 03:42:01.541
WHAT DROVE SOME THE SUNSETS THAT

03:42:01.608 --> 03:42:02.108
WE WERE DISCUSSING THE VICE

03:42:02.175 --> 03:42:02.609
CHAIR TANG.

03:42:02.676 --> 03:42:03.943
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO

03:42:04.010 --> 03:42:09.349
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

03:42:09.416 --> 03:42:09.816
SPENDING THE MONEY AS

03:42:09.883 --> 03:42:11.484
EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.

03:42:11.551 --> 03:42:12.519
MADAM CHAIR IF I CAN TO THE

03:42:12.585 --> 03:42:13.153
FOLLOW UP QUESTION ARE ARE YOU

03:42:13.219 --> 03:42:15.221
SUGGESTING THAT YOU DON'T TRUST

03:42:15.288 --> 03:42:17.157
THEM THE PROVIDERS -- AND THAT

03:42:17.223 --> 03:42:17.857
YOU HAVE TO GO DOING GOOD DIG IN

03:42:17.924 --> 03:42:19.192
A LITTLE BIT MORE TO BE ABLE TO

03:42:19.259 --> 03:42:19.726
FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY'RE

03:42:19.793 --> 03:42:20.460
SPENDING THIS MONEY -- BUT

03:42:20.527 --> 03:42:21.428
EFFECTIVELY TO FEEL LIKE THERE'S

03:42:21.494 --> 03:42:23.163
THERE'S ABUSE I MEAN I AGAIN I

03:42:23.229 --> 03:42:24.564
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM

03:42:24.631 --> 03:42:26.332
THE FOLKS IN IN IN IN MY

03:42:26.399 --> 03:42:28.068
DISTRICT PROVIDERS THEIR THEIR

03:42:28.134 --> 03:42:29.602
THEIR THEIR DESPERATE AT THIS AT

03:42:29.669 --> 03:42:30.537
THIS POINT.

03:42:30.603 --> 03:42:31.438
AND THAT'S I THINK IS WHY

03:42:31.504 --> 03:42:32.539
THERE'S A THERE'S A LEVEL OF

03:42:32.605 --> 03:42:34.274
FRUSTRATION AMONGST -- THE

03:42:34.340 --> 03:42:35.608
LEGISLATURE AND THE BOARD OF

03:42:35.675 --> 03:42:37.444
DIRECTORS THE CITY CALIFORNIAN

03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:38.211
REGARDS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE

03:42:38.278 --> 03:42:39.879
SAYING A NEFF'S ENOUGH WE'VE GOT

03:42:39.946 --> 03:42:42.348
TO PROPERLY PROPERLY FUND THEM.

03:42:42.415 --> 03:42:44.551
WELL AGAIN I I DON'T GET WHAT

03:42:44.617 --> 03:42:45.652
THE HANG UP IS NO I SHOULD

03:42:45.719 --> 03:42:47.220
CLARIFY WAS NOT SAYING THAT --

03:42:47.287 --> 03:42:49.856
WAS FOCUSED MORE ON IN TERMS OF

03:42:49.923 --> 03:42:50.890
YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS DEALING

03:42:50.957 --> 03:42:52.225
WITH TRADE OFFS SO IF WE'RE

03:42:52.292 --> 03:42:53.393
GOING TO INVEST A SET AMOUNT OF

03:42:53.460 --> 03:42:54.360
MONEY WHETHER IT'S A HUNDRED

03:42:54.427 --> 03:42:55.495
MILLION DOLLARS.

03:42:55.562 --> 03:42:57.764
OR MORE A THE ASSEMBLY AND

03:42:57.831 --> 03:42:59.365
SENATE HAVE PROPOSED POWER WE

03:42:59.432 --> 03:43:03.937
ALLOCATING THAT MONEY AND WHAT

03:43:04.003 --> 03:43:04.571
TYPES OF OUTCOMES ARE WE GETTING

03:43:04.637 --> 03:43:08.775
FOR IT.

03:43:08.842 --> 03:43:11.611
CENTER FOR LAW AND ORDER.

03:43:11.678 --> 03:43:13.713
MAYBE I COULD FOLLOW UP ON SEVEN

03:43:13.780 --> 03:43:15.949
MAYES THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING.

03:43:16.015 --> 03:43:16.950
WHAT TERM?

03:43:17.016 --> 03:43:17.951
WHAT ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY DO YOU

03:43:18.017 --> 03:43:20.053
HAVE?

03:43:20.120 --> 03:43:23.223
ALTERNATIVE IN THE SENSE OF IF --

03:43:23.289 --> 03:43:24.824
REGARDING OUR PROVIDE IF YOU

03:43:24.891 --> 03:43:26.392
COULD CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT MORE.

03:43:26.459 --> 03:43:30.063
WHAT IF THESE VENDORS DECIDE?

03:43:30.130 --> 03:43:30.864
THEY JUST CAN'T DO ANYMORE THEY

03:43:30.930 --> 03:43:31.598
CAN HIRE THE RIGHT PEOPLE WE

03:43:31.664 --> 03:43:32.665
CAN'T PROVIDE THE RIGHT SERVICE

03:43:32.732 --> 03:43:34.167
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING

03:43:34.234 --> 03:43:35.535
COMPENSATED PROPERLY.

03:43:35.602 --> 03:43:37.804
WHAT WHAT'S YOUR PLAN B.?

03:43:37.871 --> 03:43:39.706
IT'S ALSO VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN

03:43:39.773 --> 03:43:40.540
TURN OVER JITTERY SO WE'RE GONNA

03:43:40.607 --> 03:43:41.708
WE KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST PHASE

03:43:41.775 --> 03:43:42.842
OF IMPLEMENTING THIS RIGHT

03:43:42.909 --> 03:43:44.444
STUDIES SO WE WILL BE.

03:43:44.511 --> 03:43:45.979
TRACKING -- THAT FEEDBACK VERY

03:43:46.045 --> 03:43:47.247
VERY CLOSELY BOTH WITH THE

03:43:47.313 --> 03:43:48.948
VENDORS THEMSELVES AND WITH

03:48:13.613 --> 03:48:15.114
SOMETHING THAT TALK ABOUT WELL

03:48:15.181 --> 03:48:15.948
