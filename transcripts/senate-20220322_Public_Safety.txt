WE HAVE A BILLS TODAY- ON THE AGENDA HOWEVER- SOONER JONES HAS POURED S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY NINE. AND SO WILL HAVE SEVEN THAT WE WILL HERE BEFORE WE BEGIN OUR TESTIMONY WE WILL ESTABLISH A QUORUM. MASSOUD COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. BRADFORD YOUR BRADFORD HERE ADOBO. TROUBLED HERE CALM WATER YOU'RE A LONGER HERE SKINNER WIENER WE GOT A WE HAVE A QUORUM IF ONE IS PRESENT SO NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR AND AT SENATOR BATES YES YES SB NINE OH FORCE INTERPRET. THANK YOU I AM BERMAN BRADFORD ACTUALLY I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH S. B. TEN SIXTY I'VE THREE BILLS THE IN MY WITNESSES ARE WAITING ALL RIGHT WE'LL START WITH S. THREE TWO IN SIXTY SB TEN SIXTY- I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB TEN SIXTY CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS WHICH HAS SPENT NOW TO A LIST OF DANGEROUS DRUGS INCLUDING HEROIN AND COCAINE WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS. ON WEIGHT. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO MATCH FENTANYL'S POTENCY WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER DRUGS THIS BILL CREATES A NEW SET OF WEIGHT ENHANCEMENTS. FOR FENTANYL THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM THOSE CURRENTLY LISTED FOR HEROIN COCAINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE AS A RESULT WAIT ENHANCEMENTS WOULD BE TRIGGERED IF SOMEONE IS CAUGHT WITH AT LEAST TWENTY GRAMS OF FAT NOW. THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES OXY CODE OWN IN THE CATEGORY OF DRUGS LIKE HEROIN COCAINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO ENHANCEMENTS BY WEIGHT DUE TO THE FACT. THAT THEY ARE OFTEN USED AS A CONDUIT BY TRAFFICKERS TO DELIVER FENTANYL TO UNSUSPECTING USERS. THIS IS MY FIFTH TIME BRINGING A SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT FOR FIT NOW TO THIS COMMITTEE I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF THAT. BUT I'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO BUILD THE FENTANYL CONTINUES. TO BE- A- HORRIBLE ARE IMPACT- DEADLY ONE ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK IT NEEDS A CONSTANT REVIEW. IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT NARCOTICS TEAMS HAVE SEIZED OVER TWO HUNDRED. AND FIVE POUNDS OF SUSPECTED FENTANYL IN OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE THOUSAND KILL SUSPECTED TO CONTAIN SOME LEVEL OF FENTANYL. IN ONE RECENT CASE THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE WORKS WITH FEDERAL PARTNERS. AND SEES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT POUNDS OF FAT NOW FORTY TWO POUNDS OF METH AND FIFTEEN POUNDS OF MARIJUANA. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STATES THAT FENTANYL RELATED OVERDOSES ROSE FROM TWO HUNDRED AND ONE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. TO THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX JUST SIX YEARS LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY. IN OTHER WORDS FENTANYL OVERDOSES JUMPED BY MORE THAN 20001100% IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THE RISE OF FENTANYL OVERDOSES HAS ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ACCORDING TO THE CDC THAT NO OVERDOSES RATES FOR NON HISPANIC AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE LARGEST ANNUAL PERCENTAGE INCREASE. FROM. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AT ONE HUNDRED AND 40% PER YEAR. FOLLOWED BY HIS. AT ONE HUNDRED AND 18% PER YEAR IN OVERDOSES FOR NON HISPANIC WHITE PERSONS INCREASED BY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND NINE PERCENT. THESE SOBERING STATISTICS SPEAK VOLUMES TO THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. SB TEN SIXTY CRACKS DOWN ON DRUG CARTELS AND HIGH LEVEL DRUG DEALERS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTING TRAFFICKING OF SELLING MASS QUANTITIES OF THIS POISON. BECAUSE OF FENTANYL'S HEIGHTENED POTENCY THE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS WOULD BE TRIGGERED WHEN SOMEONE IS CAUGHT WITH A MINIMUM OF TWENTY GRAMS OR MORE OF THAT NOW AS OPPOSED TO ONE GRAM. ONE MILLIGRAM ONE. CLOSE TO ONE KILOGRAM OR MORE OF HEROIN OR COCAINE. IT ONLY TAKES TWO MILLIGRAMS FOR FENTANYL TO BE FATAL FOR MOST PEOPLE TO PLACE THAT AMOUNT INTO PERSPECTIVE. TWENTY GRAMS OF FAT NOW CONTAINS TEN THOUSAND LETHAL DOSES. THIS REFLECTS. THAT KNOWS LARGER POTENCY WHICH IS UP TO FIFTY TIMES MORE POTENT THAN PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE HEROIN IS OFTEN MIXED INTO HEROIN AND OTHER DRUGS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF USERS THAT CAN BE DEADLY SIMPLY IF IT BECOMES AIRBORNE. MAKES CONTACT WITH THE SKIN AND POSES SIGNIFICANT DANGER TO FIRST RESPONDERS IT DOES NOT CHANGE SENTENCE FOR END USERS OR FOR THOSE USING MEDICAL THAT NOW FOR IS LEGITIMATE AND PRESCRIBE PURPOSE. AND IT GIVES LARA LAW ENFORCEMENT A NEEDED TOOL TO PREVENT AN EPIDEMIC OF DEATHS AND OVERDOSES THAT WE SEE HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE RIVERSIDE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE ARE CO SPONSORS OF THE MEASURE AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY. AS THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL THE RIVERSIDE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REPRESENTED BY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. ATTORNEY ROBERT HOW HOW TO HIGHTOWER IN ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF DON BARNES. ALL RIGHT IF YOUR WITNESSES ARE PREPARED WILL PROVIDE THEM TO MANAGE EACH WE HAVE- ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF DON BARNES AND WE HAVE. RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY I TO OUR SHOW. YOUR FARM JERRY PREPARE. YES MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- THIS DRUG EPIDEMIC OF THE NATION'S MOST SIGNIFICANT LONG TERMPUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS OF OUR TIME. FOR THE FIRST TIME THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD NATIONWIDE DRUG RELATED DEATHS EXCEEDED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BETWEEN APRIL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THREE OR SIX AMERICANS LOST THEIR LIVES TO DRUG RELATED DEATHS. THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THAT NUMBER IS SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS LIKE FENTANYL DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PERSPECTIVE THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF TEN BOEING SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN AIRLINE JETS CRASHING EACH WEEK EVERY WEEK FOR A YEAR STRAIGHT. AT THAT MANY AIRLINE CRASHES OCCURRED WE WOULD DO SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY TO FIX THE PROBLEM. SB TEN SIXTY AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP OUR FENTANYL PROBLEM. I KNOW THIS IS A SIMILAR BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE SEVERAL TIMES I'VE BEEN REJECTED- EACH TIME THIS VERSION HOWEVER IS PERHAPS THE MOST. POWERFUL TO CREATE AN ENTIRE SEPARATE CLASSIFICATION OF PENALTIES FOR FENTANYL TRAFFICKING. NOT THE END USERS FOR THE TRAFFICKING THE SUBSTANCE. THE RECOGNIZES THE POTENCY OF THIS DEADLY SUBSTANCE. I REMIND YOU THAT THIS DALY SUBSTANCE THAT CLAIMED MORE LIVES EACH AND EVERY DAY. IN MY COUNTY ALONE THE NUMBER OF PANEL RELATED DEATHS WAS THIRTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND ROSE TO SIX HUNDRED NINETY THREE. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. WOULD STILL SIXTY TWO CASES PENDING. I KNOW CAN A BIRD INCREASE SENTENCES I AGREED AN INCREASED SENTENCE ALONE WILL NOT WORK. WE ALSO NEED EDUCATION AND TREATMENT THESE ARE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR EFFORTS IN ORANGE COUNTY. WITH REGARD TO EDUCATION OR ABOVE THE INFLUENCE DRUG EDUCATION PROGRAM WHICH I BELIEVE WILL BE A NATIONAL MODEL WAS UNVEILED THIS YEAR FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. TREATMENT SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF WHAT WE DO AS WELL OUR COUNTY SUPPOSE HE CARES PROGRAM BUT THE INTEGRATED SERVICES. AND MEDICINE ASSISTED TREATMENT IN OUR JAILS ARE WORKING TO HELP ADDICTS MAKING IT A PRIORITY. ON ANY GIVEN DAY WHICH WE HAVE THE SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE CAME OUT TO THE TUNE OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF THIS FUNDED OUT COUNTY FUNDS. NOT THROUGH STATE OR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. THE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT WHAT WE ARE TO EDUCATE ENTRY WE ALSO KNOW THE MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS NEEDED THAT THAT ASPECT OF THE SOLUTION. FLOODING OUR COMMUNITY THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ASSISTS TWO HUNDRED FIVE POUNDS. INTROSPECTIVE ONE OR FORTY THREE LIST OF PILLS THAT CONTAINED FENTANYL. CAN WE DO SOMETHING WITH A LONG TO ENSURE THOSE MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASED DEATH FACE SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR ACTIONS. WHAT IS THE OBJECTION TO SIGNIFICANT JAIL TIME FOR SOMEONE WHO WOULD WILLINGLY TRAFFIC TO THIS DEADLY POISON AT THE EXPENSE OF CALIFORNIA LIVES. AS ONE OF THE WORST WITH OVER THREE DECADES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE EXPERIENCE I KNOW THE LAW WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE ONLY ENCOURAGES BAD BEHAVIOR. DISPIRITING CONSEQUENCE FOR HEROIN AND CONSEQUENCE FOR FENTANYL MAKES THIS CLEAR. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY HEROIN DEATHS INCREASED 27% WELL THANKS NO DOUBT TO INCREASE FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. THE LACK OF CONSEQUENCE ALONG WITH THE EASE OF MANUFACTURING THE DRUG DRUG WHICH IS CHEAPER AND EASIER TO TRAFFIC THAN OTHER DRUGS. COOL CLEARLY INCENTIVIZE THE TRAFFICKING OF THIS MORE POTENT SUBSTANCE. I BELIEVE WE CAN ACT TODAY PLEASE HELP US HELP CALIFORNIANS BY PASSING. THIS COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS THANK YOU WITNESS. YEAH THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ROBERT HI CAROLINE KENNEDY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. AT THE RIVER BATES POINTED OUT- IT ONLY TAKES APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLIGRAM ATTENTIONAL TO BE FATAL AND OFTENTIMES WE COULD BE EVEN LESS THAN THAT DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE PERSON TAKING IT AND THEIR FAMILIARITY WITH THE DRUG. IN ADDITION AND ALL IS SIMILAR TO MORPHINE BUT IS FIFTY TO A HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT THAN MORPHINE IT. BUT MEAN I KNOW. THE REGIONAL PRODUCED. BY DRUG. THAT WAS RELEASED ANY KIND OF RECAP. HOWEVER ADDED THAT THIS DRUG HAVE BECOME MORE MORE ADDICTIVE THAN MORE MORE POPULAR. LAUGHTER NOW PRODUCING THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT THE BENEFIT. OF THE TRYING TO LEAVE CAPITAL MEANING THAT THE FACTOR OFTEN MIXED WITH OTHER DRUGS SUCH AS OXYCONTIN. AND METHAMPHETAMINE. I INDIVIDUALS WERE A DRUG A OF THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO THIS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE DRUGS. HANG UP ON THEM AND NOT UNDERSTANDING I TO POTENCY OF THE DRUG ACTUALLY MAINTAIN THAT IS THE REASON WHY INSTANCE AWAITED ENHANCEMENTS ARE NECESSARY. THEY DID NOT AND LEGISLATION AIMED AT INCARCERATING THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS BUT RATHER THOSE WHO ARE- PRODUCING THIS DRUG WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OR UNDERSTANDING HOW POLITICALLY CAN BE- AND BAKER THAT USEFUL MEASURE TO DETER- THOSE INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT A. HAT WILL HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO OUR MY- INTO THERE'S OUR OUR- ANY WITNESSES HERE PRESENT WHOSE- IN SUPPORT.

GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DIRECTLY BUT BEING THAT I THINK HEALTHCARE DIRECTIVES THAT'S ALL OF THE ALLIANCE. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY AS A FACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SB SIXTY WHICH WOULD IMPOSE AN ADDITIONAL TERM OF IMPRISONMENT UPON A PERSON LOOKING A GOOD FOR THE VIOLATION BETTER BY. PROVISIONS OF LAW WITH REGARD TO. I THINK ARE- ORGANIZATION THE IMPACT OF THE DRUG USER HAD ALL THE LIFE USER ARE FAB THAT THOSE HAVE LONG. I LOVE GOING TO OVER. CAL VOTERS HAVE REPEATEDLY SIGNALED THAT PRACTICAL AWAY FROM FAILED CARCERAL POLICIES OF THE PAST. INSTEAD SHE DOESN'T USE AT THE HEALTH CRISIS THAT IT IS. REVERTING BACK TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES NOT ONLY FIGHTING WITH EACH OF WALKABLE FREE REGULATIONS THAT ALSO LOOKS. PRUDENT TO BE BAD PUBLIC POLICY SB KERR SIXTY RELIED ON. OUTDATED WAR ON DRUGS MENTALITY ONE THAT HAS ALREADY HAD A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE CONSEQUENCES OF USING JAIL THE PRESIDENT TO DEAL WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE I THINK IN DECADES YOUR BEGAN TO UNRAVEL THE MEASURE WOULD THAT CALIFORNIA'S BACK FROM A MORE PUBLIC HEALTH CENTRIC APPROACH. HARSHER SENTENCING DOES NOT REDUCE DISTRIBUTION THAT WOULD PREVENT OVERDOSE IT'S NOT REDUCE THE SUPPLY OF DRUGS OR THE DEMAND FOR THEM AND WORK COULD ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE EFFECTIVE METHODS OF DEALING WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS. MANY PEOPLE WHO WILL BE INCORPORATED BY THE BILL- ARE ARE BOOKS THAT ARE I THINK THAT THEMSELVES OF BUREAU OF JUSTICE BUT- OF. YOUR OBJECTIVES REPORT ON THAT 20% OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED FOR GOOD PATH TRAFFICKING IN STATE PRISONS. USE DRUGS PRIOR. TO BEING A RECORD EVEN THE VISUALS OFTEN SELL DRUGS NOT FOR PROFIT THAT THE WAY TO SUPPORT. THEIR OWN SEPTIC YOU THINK. YOU STARTER. OFTEN THE SELLERS NOT HIGH MEMBER OF ANY. RIGHT IF YOU THINK THAT RATHER. FURNISHING A NARCOTICS TO FRIENDS WITH MEMBERS- ANY. AS AS THE SUPPORT STATED IT IS WE HAVE SEEN HER THOUSAND. THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS OVER CRAIG AND THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD ENDING IN A- TWO TWENTY. FURTHER PROOF THAT IMPORTANT FOR APPROACH IS TO TRY ARE NOT WORKING AND FACT CRIMINALS.

I WILL GO TO LINE FORTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS COLBY LANDS OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN PRISONERS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. AT THE TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU THANK YOU HAVING EXHAUSTED ALL OUR WITNESSES ON THE PHONE LINE WILL NOT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEES OR ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. REGARDING THIS ISSUE BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IN NINETEEN NINETY OUT OUT SENATOR JOE BOOK. SO- NO I UNDERSTAND THAT MUCH OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ARE COMING FROM THE NOTION THAT THE WORD DRUG DID NOT WORK AND THAT THIS BILL WILL BE WOULD BE A CONTINUATION ON THIS WAR- CENTER BASED IN YOUR OPINION WAS THERE ANY PART OF THE WAR ON DRUGS THAT- WAS THE FACT THAT YOU BELIEVE WAS EFFECTIVE BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE IN. WORKING WITH THE SPELL ENDED THE SENTENCES AND HUSBAND HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S A COMMON THEME THAT I'M HEARING HERE IN IN COMMITTEE AND- WE HEAR FROM THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ON THAT END- WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BETTER DIRECTED TO OUR EXPERTS WHO REALLY ARE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFF OBVIOUSLY SENT FINANCES HAVE TO DO WITH OF. JAIL AND PRISON AND OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO ARE PROSECUTING THOSE CASES I JUST. BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU SEE A REDUCTION IN HEROIN USE AND A REDUCTION IN COCAINE USE AND YOU HAVE THIS EXPLOSION AND FOUND NO USE WHERE THERE'S NO SENSE IN HOUSE WENT TO GET ON THE OTHER TWO. THERE ARE MAYBE THAT'S AN INDICATION THAT SENSE ENHANCEMENTS TO DO WORK FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF. A DISTRIBUTION AND MANUFACTURING THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE LARGE AMOUNTS. WHEN YOU WHEN I INTRODUCED THE BILL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR SENSE ENHANCEMENTS. IT FAILED UNDERSTOOD. OFF FIVE YEARS LATER WE HAVE A 20001100% INCREASE IN FENTANYL DISTRIBUTION AND TRAFFICKING. THAT SAYS SOMETHING WAS WORKING WHEN THE OTHER TWO DRUGS HAVE. ACTUALLY KIND OF FALLEN OFF THE RADAR. UP I GUESS SIMPLY SPEAKING. AND THIS DRUG IS BECOME- THE ONE THAT'S BEING IMPORTED MANUFACTURED IN HUGE AMOUNTS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE REALLY ATTICS ARE I LOOK AT THIS IS A THREE LEGGED STOOL YOU GOTTA HAVE EDUCATION. YOU GOT TO HAVE TREATMENT BUT YOU GOTTA HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND I BELIEVE A YOUNG MAN WHO SPOKE AT A PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK. R. WHO'D SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME INCARCERATED. REALLY SPOKE VERY FERVENTLY ABOUT THE ONLY REASON HE GOT OUT- INTO- EIGHT A JOB HE'S A BUSINESS OWNER BECAUSE HE HAD CONSEQUENCES. AND THOSE WERE GIVEN TO HIM WHEN HE WAS INCARCERATED BECAUSE HE GOT EDUCATION AND TREATMENT WHILE HE WAS IN. INCARCERATED SO I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT JUST NOT GENERALLY SAYING SINCE ANNOUNCEMENTS DON'T WORK. MAYBE WE NEED TO STUDY- THAT REALLY LOOKS AT THE KINDS OF SENSE AND HANDS MOST THAT HAVE WORKED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE LARGEST THREE. DISTRIBUTORS THAT THE CARTELS BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK WHY EXPERT WITNESS AND THAT WOULD BE SURE OF MARS TO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE HE HAS. BASICALLY I'D I UNDERSTAND AND BECAUSE I'M ORANGE COUNTY AND WHAT SHARE OF MARS IS DONE WE BASICALLY HAVE A JAIL IT'S BECOME ALMOST A TRIAGE CENTER TO GET PEOPLE WHO ARE. THE ADDICTS THE USERS INTO TREATMENT BUT HE'S NOT ABLE TO REACH BEYOND THAT AND GET THE BIG GUYS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE SO. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO DIRECT THAT QUESTION TO SHARE FARMS. HERE YEAH. SHE FARMS WHICH QUESTION. YES THEY GIVE CHAIRMAN RESERVE THE COMMITTEE AS CENTER BATES REFERNCED PERSON FOREMOST THE REFERENCE THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS FAILED LET ME DRAW A DISTINCTION WARS ARE FINITE BUT NOT INTENDED TO BE- INFINITE- THIS IS NOT A WAR THIS AND FOR SOME OF OUR STATE'S LAWS IS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO YOU CAN'T PROVE A NEGATIVE I THINK IF WE WERE TO JUST GIVEN UP YEARS AGO WE WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CONDITION WE WOULD BE IN TODAY. BUT AS SENATOR BATES HAS TESTIFIED TO- I BELIEVE IT'S COMPLETELY TRUE REGARDING FENTANYL WITHIN OUR STATE IF YOU GO BACK TO DATA- PRESENTED BY CDC IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OF ALL THE DEATHS NATIONALLY 4% OF THOSE THE PREVAILING DRUG THEY CALLED THAT DOUBT WAS SPENT IN L. THAT FIVE YEARS LATER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT HAD RIPPED 40% OF DEATH NATIONALLY THEY'LL BE OUR CONTENT SPECIFICALLY. OVER 70% SO LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS ACTUALLY CURSED IN MY BELIEVE THE TRUTH THE. TRAFFICKING OF NARCOTICS. AND STORE NOW. THAT THE THREE PRONGS OF THIS AB TRUE IN ANY DAY UNDER. POPULATION CIRCUMSTANCES PROOF BEFORE COVERED. A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE ARE BEING MEDICALLY SUPERVISED DETOX. OFF OF NARCOTICS THEY DIDN'T COME TO MY TL TO GET DRUG TREATMENT THEY HAPPENED UPON MY JAIL. BREAK RUN THE BEST HOSPITAL WE CAN WHILE WE HELP THEM. BUT THESE. BELIEVES THAT- BIRTH AS A RESULT OF PROP FORTY SEVEN PROP FIFTY SEVEN OTHERS THAT IF WE HAD- OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET ON TREATMENT THAT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING IN THE STATE. AND THIS IS NOT AIMED AT THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED THIS IS NAMED AIMED AT STOPPING. THE NARCOTIC THE KANEMI THAT HAPPENS IN THE STATE. WHERE DO YOU DRUG. ORGANIZATION SOUTH OF GOING TO WRITE THE AND MEET THE- NORTH OF THE BORDER. I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NARCOTICS ADDICTED PEOPLE WITHIN THE JOB BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN. ANYMORE MORE ADDICTED EVERY DAY. AND IF ANYTHING THIS SHOULD BE IN PERHAPS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO INTERRUPT AND DISRUPT THE DRUG. THE DRUG TRAFFICKING. PROBABLY TO THE BENEFIT OF SAVING CALIFORNIA LIVE TO LEASE TO SLOW IT DOWN. IF WE WERE TO DO THAT SO I BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT THIS IS IN OUR- AN APPROPRIATE. APPROACH IN MY BELIEF OF ANNOUNCED ALMOST. THIRTY THREE YEARS OF BEING IN POLICING IN THE STATE. THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY PASSED THE OFFRAMP JUST YOU WAIT TO GET THE DRUGS. THE STOCK FLOW. FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER TO NORTH OF THE BORDER AND THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY. AREAS IN WHICH WE CAN DO THAT- AND I BELIEVE FROM ME THAT THIS WOULD BE AT HAVE A DIRECT POSITIVE RESULT IF WE WERE TO PASS THIS BILL. AND ALL THE CATHOLICS WERE TRAFFICKING NARCOTICS. NOT THOSE WHO ARE THE END USERS. THANK YOU WITH SOME QUESTIONS SOME SOME COMMENTS AND- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ACTUALLY BLESSED TO HAVE AND MET CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS IN MY LIFE THAT I CALL FRIENDS WHO HAVE SERVED TIME AND THEY HAVE DONE A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW COMPELLED NOT COMPEL THEM BUT- DIRECTED THEM TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND SERVE TIME AND I CAN THINK OF A GENTLEMEN- A FRIEND OF MINE. WHO WHO SAID YOU KNOW THANKS TO THE THREE STRIKES LAW I ACTUALLY DID A- CHANGE IN MY LIFE BECAUSE HE SERVED TIME HE REALIZED THAT IF. HE DID SOMETHING ELSE HE WAS GONNA BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME AND THIS IS A GENTLEMAN WHO. WAS VERY ROUGH AND I'LL YOU KNOW I CALL NO MORE FOR THE VERY NOW BUT- BY YOU LOOK AT HIM AND YOU WOULD BE VERY INTIMIDATED BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT HE'S DONE IN THE WAY HE SPEAKS AND SO FORTH BUT- HE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND HAVING CERTAIN- PARAMETERS THAT HE HAD TO FEAR IN ORDER FOR HIM. SHAPE UP IN SANTA I'M GONNA CHANGE MY MY DISTRICT AS WELL WHO ALSO SERVED TIME. AND ALSO SAID YOU KNOW THERE WAS A TIME AFTER HE WAS. CONVICTED I THINK WAS THE SECOND TIME- WHERE HE MET A GENTLEMAN AND SAID YOU KNOW I'VE HAD I NOT HAVE THOSE PARAMETERS IN THOSE FEARS I WOULD NOT HAVE. DECIDED NO THAT'S NOT THAT'S HOW I'M GOING TO END UP WITH DON'T YOU MAKE A CHANGE SO THERE SOMETIMES AND EVEN AS A PARENT. YOU KNOW I I'VE READ MANY BOOKS AND DISCIPLINE AND TALKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING PARAMETERS HAVING- THINGS THAT YOU- BOB FRANKEN GOING TO ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS BUT IMPORTANT HAVING CONSEQUENCES. AND HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE HAVE YOU. FOR- AND THEN. JUST THE WORDS THAT IN RIGHT NOW IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE A LOT OF. LAWS PROHIBITING AND- CREATING MORE MORE LAW. WE IT COMES TO. GUN IN THE STATE. BECAUSE OF WHAT THE INCREASE OF- HOMICIDES OR WHATEVER MAYBE YOU KNOW THERE'S A TENDENCY TO HAVE THAT IN PLACE. BUT YEAH WHEN IT COMES TO THIS PARTICULAR. TOPIC WHEN IT COMES TO VOTE AND ALL. AND THE- DEATHS THAT WE'RE- SCENE. AND AND EXPERIENCING WITH ARE YOU DYING. JUST THIS WEEK AND I HAVE TO SHARE- I HAD- MY SON WAS RACING AND ARE THERE IS A SON IN A IN A IN A FATHER RIGHT NEXT TO US. AND THE IN THE SUN SAID HE GOES YOU KNOW IN OUR IN OUR POCKET YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A SMBOL TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR SON CAN TAKE TO HELP THEM GET. GOING TO KEEP GOING. AND- AND WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WAS BEING VERY POLITE BUT HAVING SAT ON THIS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND HEARING THE STORIES LAST YEAR BUT. I DID LAST YEAR. I GREW UP TO SEPT CAN WE FEEL GREAT WERE THAT NOISES COME FROM THANK YOU. AND- SERVICE YOU KNOW THIS DAD AND SON SHARING THEIR SUPPLEMENTS WITH ME AND I AND I YOU KNOW WAS BEING POLITE GRABBED IT I WAS READING AND LOOKING AT THE LABEL AND SO FORTH AND ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS THOSE PARENTS LAST YEAR. IN THINKING I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM. I'M AS GOOD WILL INTENDED AS THIS WAS FURTHER FROM THIS DAD AND SON HERE I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE. YOU KNOW USE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS BUT ALL I COULD THINK OF. WAS THE STORIES OF THOSE PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN. UNBEKNOWNST AND TOOK SOMETHING. OUT MANY OF THEM THINKING PAIN MEDICATION WAS LACED WITH FENTANYL AND I THOUGHT NEVER. AND I DON'T WANT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL NINETY WHEN IT YOU KNOW SHARE MY STORIES OF. THE FEARS THAT I HAVE BUT I DO I LIVE WITH THAT FEAR EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND AFTER WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK THIS WEEK IN IMPORT AT WITH THOSE BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IF WE FEEL COMPELLED THAT WE HAVE TO DO. SOMETHING WITH WITH GUNS BECAUSE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM I'M SORRY BUT FENTON ALL RIGHT NOW. IS AN EPIDEMIC IN BECAUSE IF IT'S COMING TO PEOPLE UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM. I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT WITH THIS BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE USERS PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION BUT FOR PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY ARE DISTRIBUTING. OR MANUFACTURING THE BIG BIG PEOPLE THERE BECAUSE I THINK THEM THERE IS NO INTENT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOUR MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTING HAS THE ABILITY TO. KILL SOMEONE. IT'S DIFFERENT IF YOU'RE USED TO YOU'RE JUST DOING IT DEALING AND I CAN UNDERSTAND MIKE MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THINKING THAT THIS IS JUST THE BUSINESS FOR THEM IT'S A MEANS TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING BIG AMOUNTS WE'RE TALKING DISTRIBUTING AT THIS LEVEL. HE GOES TO BED IN I'M SORRY THAT IS. INTENDED THEIR- AND THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MANY PARENTS. MANY MEMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE IF THEY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES THEY WERE. ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED IF WE DON'T ARE HOLDING THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE BIG BIG NUMBERS OF. BIG SHIP IS INDUSTRY READING. NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BETTER IN THE STATE HOLDING THIS BIG PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. START SOMEWHERE. PARENTS LIKE MYSELF SHOULD NOT MAYBE TERRIFIED. MY KIDS WERE ACCIDENTALLY TAKE SOMETHING LACED WITH. TERRIBLE THINGS. AND I'M PLEADING WITH MY WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE. THAT WE GO AFTER THESE BIG PEOPLE THAT ARE USERS NOT THE WHAT THEY'RE SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION BECAUSE THAT IS ANOTHER IT AND I HAVE COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ADDICTION I REALLY DO AND I'M WORKING ON NOT IN THIS WORLD. BUT NOT THE BIG DISTRIBUTORS THE PEOPLE WITH ILL INTENT. THEY NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN I HOPE I HOPE IN A PLEA WITH YOU TO GO AFTER THESE BIG PEOPLE. AND NOT UNDERMINED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND- MCCAULEY FROM SAMBAR DINO COUNTY AYE- I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE FEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE DRUGS I THINK IT'S A PERCOCET OR OR WHATEVER AND THEN IT HAS DENTAL AND SENTINEL IS SO TOXIC AND IT IS TERRIFYING TO KNOW AND I WILL HAVE A LIVE PEOPLE MIGHT. LIVE OVER THE YEARS TO DROP MY CHILDREN BUT PEOPLE WHO I LOVE WHO HAVE USED AND KNOWING THAT THEY COULD RECEIVE DRUGS THAT ARE LACED AND COULD END UP DYING IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING AND IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER- IT ABSOLUTELY IS. AND YOU KNOW IF I IF I THOUGHT BAG IN THE CAR SURVATION WAS GONNA SOMEHOW LIKE AND THIS IT'S SOMETHING. TO CONSIDER BUT WE- THE TRAGEDY. A SPECIAL IN THE BEATING BILLS LIKE THIS IS THAT WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE. WE KNOW FROM LIKE REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THAT THESE ENHANCEMENTS AND HARSHER ARCHER SENSES DON'T ACTUALLY REDUCE DRUG USE AND DON'T REDUCE OVERDOSES- YOU KNOW WE HAD AN NINETEEN EIGHTIES EPIDEMIC OF CRACK COCAINE- AND A LOT OF WHICH WAS FOR DYING PEOPLE WERE IT WAS A LOT OF HARM BUT WAS COMING. FROM CRACK COCAINE USE AND SO IN THIS COUNTRY WE UP THE SENSES AND JUST STARTED JUST HACKING OUR JAILS- FULL OF PEOPLE AND IT DOESN'T REDUCE DRUG USE AND NOW WE HAVE DIFFERENT DRUGS THAT PEOPLE ARE USING AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE DYING FROM. AND SO I CHEST I DON'T THINK THAT THIS APPROACH IS ACTUALLY. GOING END UP SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES BECAUSE FROM EXPERIENCE WE KNOW THAT HARSHER JAIL SENTENCES OR DON'T END UP CHANGING. DRUG USE OF PEOPLE ARE IS LONGER IF PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED THEY'RE GOING TO USE ARE GONNA FIND A WAY TO USE. AND THE HARDER WE MAY GET ACTUALLY THE MORE DANGEROUS IT IS BECAUSE IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE ALYSSA ANALYSTS AT PLUS. WAY OFF THE BEATEN TRACK AND PEOPLE GET DESPERATE FOR THE DRUGS AND THAT IS SERVED THIRTY YEAR NASTIER KINDS OF DRUGS AND MORE CONTAMINATED DRUGS- AND- AND AS LONG AS THERE IS DEMAND. THERE WILL BE SUPPLY. AND THEY'LL FIND A WAY FOR THE SUPPLY- TO BE THERE AS FAR EVEN IF WE MAKE THINGS HARSHER. THIS BILL IN ADDITION. DOES GO BEYOND I THINK THE KING PENS- IT STARTS AT TWENTY GRAMS AND I'M NOT SAYING TWENTY GRAMS OF SOME TINY AMOUNT OF DRUGS BUT THAT IS. THAT'S NOT. PICKING PAN TWENTY GRAMS- AND IT DOES NOT REQUIRE. MY READING OF I DOES NOT REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE. THAT THE DRUGS ARE LACED WITH FENTANYL- FOR EXAMPLE SO IT'S NOT DISCIPLINE DRUG THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO I AM INTENTIONALLY STE. COMMITTING FRAUD BY SAYING I'M SELLING YOU A COCAINE ADDICT COCAINE. LACED WITH FENTANYL I INTENTIONALLY MISREPRESENTING THAT TO YOU THE STOCK BUILD IS NOT REQUIRE THAT LEVEL KNOWLEDGE IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT AND THAT'S NOT EVEN A SALE. IT'S FURNISHING IT'S GIVING C. GIVE SOMEONE. IN AND AMOUNTS THAT'S NOT A DRUG KINGPIN AMOUNT AND YOU DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE SPENT ON A AND YOUR ON THE HOOK AND YOU'RE GONNA GET A MINIMUM OF THREE ADDITIONAL YEARS- AND STATE- INSTEAD PRISON- THIS. IS OUR THE FRONTAL- THERE IS A DENTAL IS A TRAGEDY AND MIKE IN SAN FRANCISCO TO ABOUT TWO PEOPLE OR DIE A DAY OF DRUG OVERDOSES NOT ONLY FUNCTIONAL IT'S ALSO FROM THE MATH OR COULD BE HER WIN BUT A LOT OF IT IS POSSIBLE TO PEOPLE DAY AND BY- LITTLE ITTY BITTY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO ARE DYING OF THIS- AND- IT IS- IT'S JUST HAVING HUGE IMPACTS AND HONESTLY IT'S GETTING WORSE BECAUSE- THERE ARE I WAS ON- I SEE A SEMINAR FOR THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATORS AROUND ADDICTION. THERE ARE FOR THE OLDER STUFF THIS IS WORSE THAN CONTENT ALL LIKE SENATOR I THINK BECAUSE- LEGISLATOR ON THIS REPORT CARFENTANIL AND OTHER SYNTHETICS THAT ARE EVEN WORSE A LITTLE THERE ARE NO MARKETS IN THIS COUNTRY WERE YOU CANNOT GET HER AWAY ANYMORE YOU CAN'T GET HER WHEN IT'S ONLY SYNTHETIC FOOD SO MUCH CHEAPER- AND SO WE NEED MORE AGGRESSIVE AND STRATEGIES BUT I THEY NEED TO BE STRATEGIES THAT ACTUALLY WORK AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT HARSHER HARSHER SENTENCES WORK- IN REDUCING DRUG USE AND WE KNOW FROM PRACTICE THAT THAT THAT THEY DON'T SO. THAT'S WHY I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU AT THE RISK ECHO A MUCH OF WHAT- MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN FRANCISCO SHARED- I TO WANT TO- STATE THAT- YOU KNOW IS DISASTROUS TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS TALKING TO A FRIEND OF MINE WHO LOST HIS SON TO- AN OVERDOSE. COCAINE LACED WITH FENTANYL- IT'S A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE- AND IT IS A PERSONAL AND- A DEEPLY PERSONAL- PAIN. I ALSO AGREE THAT WE DO NEED TO DEVELOP A THREE LEG AID- RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE- THAT SHOULD INCLUDE EDUCATION TREATMENT AND CONSEQUENCES I THINK THE QUESTION FOR ME IS WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE AND THAT WILL WORK. YOU KNOW FENTON ALL- IS CHEAP I MEAN THAT'S WHY FOLKS ARE NECESSARILY USING COCAINE OR SOME OF THESE OTHER SUBSTANCES IT IS IT'S A SYNTHETIC IT IS CHEAPER TO MANUFACTURE AND IT IS MUCH MORE POTENT AND FOR FOLKS WHO ARE ADDICTS THE GOAL IS. A RICH HI IMPORTANT HAI AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND WANT AS MUCH HELP AS POSSIBLE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DRASTICALLY CURTAIL OR STOP SUPPLY I'D AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT DEMAND. NOT DEMAND YES DEMAND AND SUPPLY BECAUSE IF YOU GET RID OF ONE PERSON THERE ARE GOING TO BE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR WHO ARE GOING TO READILY STEP UP TO FILL THE VOID IN THE MARKET PLACE AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- THE ENHANCEMENTS SUGGESTED IN THIS BILL. ARE EQUAL TO- FOUR TO THREE AND A HALF POUNDS WHICH IS SMALLER THAN THE EXISTING WAIT ENHANCEMENTS AMOUNTS WHICH- ALSO FOR ME YOU KNOW CALLS INTO QUESTION YOU KNOW. IS THIS REALLY GOING TO ATTACK THE NARCOTICS ECONOMY- YOU KNOW ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE CAN EMPLOY A REAL HARM REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND SERVICES- SO THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW DEALING WITH THE CRISIS AT HAND WHICH IS ADDICTION. YOU KNOW AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I DO ACTUALLY HAVE TO PUSH BACK ON YOU KNOW CALLING THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO TASK AND HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO FIGURING OUT HOW TO YOU KNOW MANAGE THROUGH- THE DEMANDS AND COME TO SOME PEACE THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE DEAD. I WAS READING JUST TODAY. ANOTHER BIG THING YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO MENTIONED OTHER- ILLICIT DRUGS THAT ARE YOU KNOW MORE READILY AVAILABLE AND ARE ARE KILLERS. A TOP KILLER IS ALCOHOL LAST YEAR THERE WAS A DEATHS. WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER THOSE THAT SELL ALCOHOL. YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE KILLING ALCOHOL HAS KILLED FOLKS ACROSS AGE RANGES ETHNIC RANGES GENDER RANGES INCOME LEVELS. AND SO ULTIMATELY HOW ARE WE WORKING TO CREATE POLICY. THAT ADDRESSES THE ADDICTION THAT ADDRESSES THE SUPPLY AND THAT DOES IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T GO AFTER A SMALL PERCENTAGE- OF FOLKS THAT CAN EASILY BY BE BACK FILLED BY OTHER FOLKS JUST WAITING TO JUMP IN AND TAKE OVER- THAT PARTICULAR MARKET PLACE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS. WILL ACHIEVE IT IN A WAY THAT I THINK THE AUTHOR AND PROBABLY THE SPONSORS WANT TO SEE ACHIEVED- AND SO THAT'S WHY I WILL BE. ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE AND WHILE I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR- AND FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BE PART OF POLICY MAKING THAT CAN TRULY ATTACK YOU KNOW THE ISSUE THAT'S AT HAND. Q. IN ADDITION SENATOR THE TROUBLE. SO SORRY I. I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE TO THE NOTION TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME LET ME GO BACK AND SAY IF THE AMOUNT THAT IS ADDRESSING TO INTO THE IN THIS BILL WITH REGARDS TO WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN IN PLACE IN THE POLICY DOES NOT FIT YOUR CRITERIA OF BEING SOMETHING WORTHY OF A MANUFACTURER DISTRIBUTOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL CAMPAIGN- I HAND THEN WHAT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BECAUSE I THINK WITH THIS PARTICULAR BEAR WITH THIS PARTICULAR DRUG WITH FENTANYL THE AMOUNT THAT IS THAT IS LETHAL AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT I DON'T KNOW BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL DRUG I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR DRUG YOU DON'T NEED MUCH IN ORDER TO. KILL SOMEONE. SO IF THIS IF THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN THIS BILL DO NOT MEET YOUR CRITERIA OF A DISTRIBUTOR MANUFACTURE WHAT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED ONE THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AND PERHAPS MAYBE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE AUTHOR MIGHT CONSIDER REVISING ON THERE TO HOLD THESE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. IF YOU KNOW IF THE COMMITTEE WISHES TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW BECAUSE I THINK THEY SHOULD BECAUSE THAT IS INTENTIONALLY THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND SECOND. WE CONTINUOUSLY TALK ABOUT IN IN THESE IN THESE BILLS WITH SENTINEL WE TALK ABOUT THE USERS AND WITH THE USERS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU WE SHOULD HAVE MORE PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF ADDICTION. BY WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS HOPING TO ADDRESS THE DISTRIBUTORS AND MANUFACTURERS AND IF THAT IS THE IF THAT IS THE CONCERN. THEN PLEASE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ON RECORD WHAT IS THE AMOUNT THAT. CAN BE PUT IN STATUTE TO HOLD THESE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE TO ENHANCEMENTS- I'M THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE. IN A WINNER TOOK A COUPLE OF IMPOSSIBLE THIS IS I'VE BEEN ON THE SCREEN THIS IS MY SIXTH YEAR ON THIS COMMITTEE I THINK IF I RECALL CORRECTLY I'VE VOTING ON THIS BILL EVERY YEAR I'VE BEEN. A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE AS I MEAN I COMMENCED THE AUTHOR FOR HER- I ALWAYS I HER PERSISTENCE- THAT ID I RESPECT ANY LEGISLATOR WHO IT WHETHER I AGREE OR DISAGREE WHO JUST REALLY BELIEVES IN ENSURING JUST. KEEPS FROM COMING BACK AND COMING BACK BECAUSE YOU TRULY BELIEVE IN THIS AND I RESPECT THAT SO THIS BILL IS BEFORE US MANY TIMES ARE MANY UP AND I KNOW IT'S CHANGED A LITTLE BIT I THINK EVERY YEAR- AND YOU KNOW. IF THE AUTHOR BRINGS ABOUT NEXT YEAR MAYBE IT'LL- I SEE AUTHOR I'M SORRY WON'T BE HERE NEXT YEAR BUT IN TERMS. OF THE AUTHOR- TO PASS IT ON ANOTHER AUTHOR- FIVE OF THE AUTHOR IF YOU'RE INSEVERE. BRING A- THERE COULD BE OTHER CHANGE. BUT I ALSO TO SEE. KNOW THAT THE TERMS OF WHEN WE THINK KING CAUSE A LOT TIMES WHEN. THESE AND WHEN I SAY SMALL AND SMALLER. TO WHAT WE WOULD. DO IS TO THE TRUE LIKE CAMPAIGN OF. I CELLS. THESE FOLKS ALSO ADDICTED OFTEN. AND THE AND THE BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SALES IT'S ALSO IT'S VERY BROAD IT'S GIVING FURNISHING- AND SO IT DOES SWEEP AND- PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED. AND IN TERMS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY YOU KNOW THE FOR LACK OF AND OR THE KING AND THE REAL. BIG FISH. THEY ARE I MEAN. DRUG DEALING IN CALIFORNIA FIRST OF ALL IS SUBJECT TO STATE PRISON. CURRENTLY AND FOR THOSE BIGGER. FISH IT'S STILL HARSH SENTENCES THE FEDERAL SENTENCES ARE INCREDIBLY HARSH. FOR DRUG SALES ESPECIALLY THOSE HIGHER LEVELS THERE'S ALREADY. HARSH SENTENCES AVAILABLE AND ADDING ON NEW ENHANCEMENTS I DON'T. I JUST DON'T THINK IT CHANGES ANYTHING ABOUT THAT BUT THE BIG FISH I CAN ALREADY BE HARSHLY PUNISHED COMPLETELY RESPECT. WELL SENATOR IS COMING FROM AND I THINK IT'S YOU. I TOTALLY RESPECT WERE COMING FROM SEVEN DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. A SIR CALM WATER YEAH ME AND I ALSO JUST THINK I THINK THERE'S ALSO A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BETWEEN SELLERS MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS AND YOU KNOW. THE DOPE GAME IS ACTUALLY A VERY HIERARCHICAL AND INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND THERE ARE FIREWALLS BETWEEN EACH STEP IN THE GAME AND SO I AM INCREDIBLY INTERESTED IN A POLICY THAT WE COULD CRAFT AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT COULD PROBABLY BE COORDINATED WITH FEDERAL. AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO ALLOW US TO GET TO THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE AND I DON'T SEE HOW THIS ACTUALLY BY PASSES CORNER HUSTLERS AND OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE LIKE YOU KNOW HAVING A PIECE OF- YOU KNOW A PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD OR COMMUNITY OR OR OR SWAP OF REAL ESTATE. TO GET TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE MASSIVELY. MANUFACTURING THIS KILLER DRUG I MEAN I THINK THAT'S HOW YOU GET TO IT AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STORIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO GET TO THOSE FOLKS AND SO THE MIDDLE MEN AND THE FOLKS ON THE STREET THOSE PEOPLE ARE A DIME A DOZEN THEY CAN BE REPLACED THEY CAN BE REPLACED THEY CAN BE REPLACED AND WE'RE ON A HAMSTER WHEEL OF TRYING TO GET THOSE PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS WHEN AND HOW YOU CAN CREATE POLICY THAT WILL GIVE THE AMMUNITION THAT IS NEEDED TO LONG FOR SMITH. TO GET TO THE FOLKS AT THE TOP SO THAT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT THIS WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON- AND I BELIEVE THAT FOLKS KNOW. I MEAN I THINK PEOPLE KNOW- WHO. THE PEOPLE ARE SORT OF MANAGING THE CARTELS- AND SO I THINK IT DOES REQUIRE SOMETHING MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED AND ALSO HONEST ABOUT YOU KNOW THE OBSTACLES THAT WE ARE ALL UP AGAINST IF WE'RE TRYING TO ATTACK THIS PROBLEM AND I ALSO THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO MANAGE THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED. AND THEN THOSE WHO ARE REALLY AT THE TOP WHO ARE CONTROLLING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- AND ARE NOT THE ONES OFTENTIMES THAT ARE GETTING ARRESTED AND GOING THAT- STATE OR FEDERAL PRISON. GUARD THANK YOU AT I WANT TO THANK- SENATOR FOR CONSISTENCY AND PERSISTENCE IN THIS ISSUE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S SINGLE MEMBER HERE REGARDLESS OF YOUR VOTE WHO SUPPORT DRUG USE AND WHEN WANT TO GET A DEADLY DRUG LIKE FENTANYL OFF THE STREET BUT I THINK IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS. THE WAR DRUGS JUST HASN'T WORKED THERE ONLY REASON AGAIN ASKING ME MY COLLEAGUES OF TOUCH UPON IT THAT YOU SEE A DECREASE IN HEROIN AND COCAINE USE IT IS BECAUSE FUNDING WAS FARM CHEAPER THAN HEROIN AND COCAINE. AND IT'S BEING MADE AVAILABLE AT A RATE THAT YOU NOTICE IS. POPULATING OUR STREET BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ABOUT GETTING TO THE HEAD OF THE B. SAYS EVERYONE IS STATED. AND I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE STREET. DEALER WHO WANTS TO KILL THEIR CLIENTELE. I MEAN IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF MANY OF THESE FOLKS ARE ARE SELLING DRUGS ON THE STREET LEVEL THAT THEY'RE UNAWARE THAT ITS LEASE WITH THIS DEADLY POISONOUS BECAUSE AGAIN- I DON'T KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IS THAT YOU SEE I WANT TO GET READY MY CLIENTELE IT'S THE GUYS UP TOP WHO SAY. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM BECAUSE I'M SELLING AT SUCH VOLUME AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. I DON'T REMEMBER SINGLE- DRUG CARTEL OR- ALL RIGHT HEAD OF A DRUG CARTEL ARRESTED OTHER NAIL SHOP THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT HAS MADE NATIONAL NEWS. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS ANY ESCAPED. MULTIPLE TIMES. HE IS SO YEAH I'D SOLD POINT IS HERE. WHAT WE I THINK ADDICTION IS AN ISSUE HERE AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT AND AT THE CORE BUT AGAIN. TO ADD ADDITIONAL TIME AND IN THE STREET FOLKS I MEAN WE THERE ARE STILL. INDIVIDUALS IMPRISONED ODAY FOR SELLING COCAINE AND THEY HAD. WHAT'S AN OUNCE. I MEAN TILL I AYE A DIDN'T STOP COCAINE USE AGAIN THE FACT THAT THIS IS CHEAP IT'S READILY AVAILABLE IS WHY WE HAVE THIS ACT UP BACK AT THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD TODAY OF DEATH ON THE STREET AND- WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED BUT AGAIN I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS DANCERS SO. WELL LET LATER DATE THANK YOU- FOR THIS VERY IN DEPTH DISCUSSION NOW SPIRITED ONE. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A FEW CLOSING COMMENTS WE'RE NOT THE USER'S I. C. R. OR THE VICTIMS THERE THE VICTIMS OF. THE PURVEYORS OF POISON- THAT ARE ACTUALLY MANUFACTURING THESE HUGE AMOUNTS AND GETTING THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY. ARE IS A VERY INTERESTING COMMENT THIS COME UP ABOUT THE SUPPLY. WHEN YOU LIMIT THE SUPPLY THE COST OF THE PRODUCT GOES UP WE'RE SEEING THAT WITH GAS RIGHT. SAME PRINCIPLE HERE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO LIMIT THE SUPPLY REDUCE THE SUPPLY AND THE SUPPLY. IN WE CAN'T DO THAT UNLESS WE START IF WE LOOK AT A PYRAMID. YOU START WITH THE BOTTOM LEVEL OF THE PYRAMID AND YOU START ELIMINATING ONE BY ONE BY ONE INTO YOU FINALLY GET TO THE TOP AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT'S GOING TO BE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BUT IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO START AT THAT LEVEL AND LIMIT THE SUPPLY THIS BEING AVAILABLE TO OUR STREETS YOU KNOW MERCHANTS. ARE IT WILL NOT STOP THIS INCREASE THAT WE SEAT TWO HUNDRED AND ONE PERCENT. OF WHEN THERE'S NO SENSE ENHANCERS YET THE OTHER DRUGS WAS SENTENCED HIM SPENCE HAVE FALLEN OFF YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S COST OKAY THE LET'S MEET THE COST OF FELT NOW BY PUTTING SENSE ENHANCEMENTS ON THOSE. OF LARGE PRODUCERS SO IT COSTS THEM MORE INSULT PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO BE BUYING THEM THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LEASE IT INTO THE OTHER DROPPED BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO. CONSIDER WHAT THE PRICE OF POINT IS BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY TO- START WITH SENSE ENHANCEMENTS ON LARGE SEN BY THE WAY WE PICK TWENTY GRAMS HERE BECAUSE- THE POTENCY. GREATER VALUE THE ONE KILOGRAM OF THE FIVE KILOGRAMS ON THE OTHER SENSE ENHANCE DRUGS. THAT'S WHY TWENTY GRAMS AND AS I MENTIONED THAT SAW IT IS THAT TIME TWO THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND LETHAL DOSES. IN TWENTY GRAMS OF FENTANYL THAT'S BEING OF VALUE FACTORED IN DISTRIBUTED- MAYBE WITH SMALL DISTRIBUTORS BUT IT'S STILL OUT THERE SO LET'S MAKE IT COSTS MORE. LET'S LIMIT THE SUPPLY BY GETTING SENTENCING HOUSE MY ON THE DISTRIBUTORS SO. WE BUT I DO WANT. FORTUNATELY WITH JUSTICE REFORM AND- REHABILITATION THAT'S GOING ON IN OUR- JAILS AND PRISONS WERE MAKING A DIFFERENCE THERE I BELIEVE- WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY- HARD STATISTICS ON THAT. BUT I DO BELIEVE IN WITH OUR HOMELESS PROJECTS IN OUR OF BILLS WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT HOW HUGE WRAPAROUND AND THAT'S GOING TO SERVICES THAT'LL BE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE THE ADDICTS. THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE THE SUPPLY AND WE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS ON THE BIG PRODUCERS. MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. JANDA AGAIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT BECAUSE I'VE BROUGHT THIS BACK AND BROUGHT THIS ABOUT. IS BECAUSE IT HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN THE IMPACT. IN THIS DISTRIBUTION IN ITS DEADLY DEADLY AND- ARE FOR THOSE. WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY YES THREE MILLION PORT AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ON YOU CAN. M. S. AT FIRST REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. YES WE HAVE A MOTION ADMISSION TO THE WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR JOE BOOK. SB TEN SIXTY DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS BRADFORD NO RED FOR NO CHOI BOGUE HIGH TROUBLE GUY COM LONGER NO LONGER NO SKINNER. SKINNER NO WIENER WIENER NO ONE TO FOUR THANK YOU THAT'S ONE TO FOR THE MEASURE FAILED NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO SB TEN FIFTY THREE. THE NEW BATES IN MAY I. S. RECONSIDERATION. WE WILL GRANT RECONSIDERATION THANK YOU. AND THIS IS US SENATE BILL TEN FIFTY THREE. ARM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND I DO BELIEVE SENATOR WINNER SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS ACTUALLY ADDRESS THIS BILL. ALL THIS IS THE LAND THAT REQUIRES- READ MOLLY INJURY I THINK THAT'S THE ONE THAT HAS THE THREE YEARS BUT WHEN WE WHEN I COMPLETED MY INTRODUCTION I YOU MIGHT WANT TO COMMENT FOR SOME OUT. BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB TEN FIFTY THREE ANOTHER APPROACH TO COMBAT THE DEADLY TRAFFICKING AND DISTRIBUTION OF HIGHLY POTENT AND LETHAL NARCOTICS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS I MENTIONED OVERDOSE DEATHS FROM OPIOIDS AND DRUGS LACED WITH FENTANYL HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE THE RECENT SPIKE IN OPIOID OVERDOSES IN CALIFORNIA DEMANDED SWIFT RESPONSE FROM THE STATE IN ORDER TO HELP PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM PERPETRATORS. WHO SELL THESE DEADLY NARCOTICS TO INDIVIDUAL BUYERS THE VICTIMS THE BILL WILL REINSTATE PENAL CODE PROVISION ONE TWO OH. TWO TWO POINT SEVEN ARE PROVISIONS THAT A PERSON COULD RECEIVE A GREAT BODILY INJURY ENHANCEMENT IF A PERSON IS SOLD FURNISHED ADMINISTERED OR GAVE AWAY A PROHIBITED MCCARTY. AND ITS USE RESULTED IN DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY THAT PERSON COULD BE CHARGED WITH A GREAT BODILY INJURY ENHANCEMENT PURSUANT TO THE PENAL CODE. WHICH GAVE THE COURT THE OPTION TO IMPOSE A THREE YEAR ENHANCEMENT TO A SENTENCE AND CLASSIFIED THE OFFENSE AS SERIOUS AND VIOLENT. HOWEVER THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RECENTLY RULED IN PEOPLE VERSUS OUR LOW THAT IN ORDER FOR THE ENHANCEMENT TO APPLY IN THIS IS AN EXISTING ENHANCEMENT A PERSON WOULD NEED TO PERSONALLY IN MINUTES ADMINISTER THE NARCOTIC OVERRULING SEVERAL DISTRICT COURTS OF APPEAL THAT HELD OTHERWISE. THE NARROW INTERPRETATION WOULD ALLOW MOST DRUG DEALERS TO ESCAPE PUNISHMENT WHEN THE DRUGS THEY SELL LEAD TO DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY AS MOST DRUG DEALERS DO NOT PERSONALLY ADMINISTER NARCOTICS TO THEIR BUYERS. SB TEN FIFTY THREE CLARIFIES THAT ANY PERSON WHO SELLS FURNISHES ADMINISTERS OR GIVES AWAY A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PERSONALLY INFLICTED. GREAT BODILY INJURY WHENEVER THE PERSON SOLD FURNISHED ADMINISTERED OR OR GIVEN THE DRUGS SUFFERS AN INJURY FROM USING THOSE DRUGS THE BILL WOULD NOT AND I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT DOES NOT CREATE IN ENHANCEMENT RATHER. RULE PEOPLE VERSUS OUR LOW AND ALLOWS JUDGES TO IMPOSE EXISTING ENHANCEMENT AS CURRENTLY PROVIDED IN THE PENAL CODE. JUDGES WOULD RETAIN FULL DISCRETION WHETHER TO IMPOSE ENHANCEMENT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. BY DOING SO THIS BILL HELPS ENSURE THE PUNISHMENT FITS THE CRIME BY TARGETING THOSE WHO SELL INFORMATION THESE DEADLY NARCOTICS. THE SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE AND ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES. ARE CO SPONSORS OF THE MISSION OF THE MEASURE AND I HAVE TO WITNESSES TO TESTIFY TODAY. THE FIRST IS CHIEF DEPUTY PATRICK ESPINOSA WITH THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THAT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY ROBERT HIGHTOWER WITH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND THEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO HELP AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ARE WOULD THIS IS PREPARED I WILL PROVIDE YOU TO MANAGE EACH OF TOTAL FOR MANAGE OR YOUR TESTIMONY AND SUPPORT. OF SB. TEN FIFTY THREE. REALLY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CAN MY NAME IS PAT S. ON THE CHEAP GAS IN THIS CAL DISTRICT OFFICE. THE SENEGAL OFFICE IS PROUD TO SPONSOR THAT'S TWO FIFTY THREE IN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE PAIN ALL CRISIS RESULTING OVERDOSE DEATHS THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE NATION. THERE ARE MANY APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THE CRISIS SB TEN FIFTY THREE FOCUSES ON HOLDING THOSE WHO PROVIDE DRUGS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERDOSE DEATHS THAT RESULT AS WELL AS AS WELL AS A SERIES PROBABLY INJURY THAT RESULTS FROM- DRUG USE ARE DRUG. DEALING IN TWENTY NINETEEN THEIR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE STATE AND ALL RELATED DEATHS IN STUDIO COUNTY ACCORDING TO THE MATH MEDICAL EXAMINER THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY ONE SEVEN OPERATED DEBTS IT IN OUR COUNTY TWENTY TWENTY TRIPLE THE NUMBER FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. WE BELIEVE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TOTAL WILL BE MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED DEATHS. ADDICTS SUFFERING FROM OPIOID ADDICTION DON'T REALIZE THAT THEIR. ADJUSTING A FATAL DOSE IN MOST CASES. THANK LAW. PROHIBITS BECAUSE- OR CRASH. OF GOODS SUBSTANCE FOR SALE. PROVIDES PUNISHMENT FOR A VIOLATION HOWEVER CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONSEQUENCES BUT DEFENDER. RUGBY OR WHO SUPPLY THESE DRUGS. OKAY THE PERSON USING THE DRUG SUFFERS DEATH WITH GREAT BODILY INJURY OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. SB TEN FIFTY THREE RECOGNIZES THAT THE CRIME THE PERSIAN DRUGS SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THAN MERELY PENSION- THEN THE PERSON DROPS THE RESULTS FOR HARM SUCH AS DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. PROTECTION COUPLE TO TWO POINT SEVEN EIGHT ALREADY EXISTS AND ADDS THREE YEARS TO ANY FELONY RESULTING IN DEATH GPI. THIS SENSING ALLEGATION HAS BEEN A TOOL THAT IS ADDED TO FELONY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE CRIMES. TO ENSURE THAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE PROPORTIONAL TO THE HARM CAUSED SIMPLY PROVIDING DRUGS SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THE PROVIDING DRUGS THAT ACTUALLY RESULT IN DEATH OR INJURY. S. B. TEN FIFTY THREE WOULD CLARIFY THAT PERSONAL INFLICTION OF GPI INCLUDES SELLING. FURNISHING ADMINISTRATIVE OR GETTING DRUGS THAT RESULTS IN BODILY INJURY OR DEATH. THIS WILL ADDRESS THE RECENT HOLDING OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN PEOPLE VERSUS ALTHOUGH. WITH THE COURT HELD THAT A PERSON MAY BE HELD LIABLE FOR IT ADMINISTERING A DRUG. THAT RESULTS IN AN OVERDOSE DEATH. BUT WOULD NOT BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL. PENALTY OR PUNISHMENT WHEN THE PERSON PROVIDED THE DRUGS THAT RESULTED IN THE OVER OVERDOSE DEATHS THE VICTIM IN THAT CASE WAS THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO OVERDOSE FROM USING COCAINE. LACED WITH THAT NOW SB TEN FIFTY THREE WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW THE EXISTING. PROPERTY TWO POINT SEVEN. AND A HALF MEN TO REMAIN A TOOL TO BE USED TO ENSURE THAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE PROPERLY CALIBRATED. TO THE ACTUAL HARM INFLICTED WITH ASPIRIN I BOTH. WENT SB TEN FIFTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. HELLO OF THE COMMITTEE HAS AS WELL MR CHAIRMAN HOW AGAIN NOW MANY ROBERT HI WITH RIVERSIDE DISH ATTORNEY OFFICE RIVERSIDE COUNTY GALLOPED DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE PRODUCTS- CO SPONSOR- AFTER THE SENATE BILL TEN FIFTY- HAS- THIRTY EDUCATED VILLAGES FIX THE PEOPLE OF ALL DECISION. MORE IMPORTANTLY THOUGH I THINK WHAT DISPLAY DOES THE FOR OF THE ISSUE THAT WERE BROUGHT UP- BY SENATOR LEADERS WALTER COME WATER BECAUSE THIS DOES YOUR ADDRESS THOSE UP THE CHAIN WHO HAVE AVOIDED RESPONSIBILITY PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE ONES IN FACT DISTRIBUTING TO THE USERS. AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO RECOGNIZE WITH PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME OF THESE DANGEROUS DRUG FENTANYL IS NOW IN EVERYTHING IT IN COCAINE IT IS AN DANYCH IT IS IN INDIA MAY- IT IS INHERENTLY AND- WHAT PEOPLE DIED IF IT IS BECAUSE IT'S HIGHLY ADDICTIVE READING INCREASES THE DEMAND WHERE DEALERS BABY ONLY WERE ABLE TO FELLOW GRAMMAR TO EVERY WEEK OR EVERY THREE WEEKS- NOW THEY'RE ABLE TO SELL THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS BECAUSE IT RESULTING IN A HIGHLY HIGHLY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE- AND DEALERS ARE RELEASING THEIR CLIENTELE SHOOT THROUGH THE ROOF AND THEY'RE ABLE TO SELL MORE AND MORE. AND UNFORTUNATELY THOSE WERE PAYING THE PRICE ARE NOT THE DEALERS THEMSELVES ABOUT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BECOME ADDICTED TO DRUGS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE LACED WITH FENNEL IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MORE DECADES THAT WOULD INCREASE DEMAND AND INCREASED ADDICTION MEANS THAT IT TAKES VERY LITTLE UP FOR A DRUG- FELLER TO PROSPECT GETTING HUGE HUGE AMOUNT- WHAT THE BILL WILL DO WHAT IS UP. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE I GAP THAT EXISTS WITH THE GREAT BODILY INJURY ALLEGATION AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE SELLING AND FURNISHING THIS DRUG ARE RESPONSIBLE WHEN SOMEONE DOES DIE OR IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO PASS IT AS A RESULT A PANEL THAT IS MASS PRODUCED I IN FEDERAL WAY THAT COULD HARM. IN KILL PEOPLE WITHOUT I THINK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. THANK YOU KNOW MOVING BACK TO COME HEARING OR- WITNESSES INSTEAD. OF SB TWO. FIFTY THREE BUT AFTER MR CARRIM WHO SHALL FOR A BEHALF OF THE K. STATE THIS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THAT. HIM STONE ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE COW JUST ATTORNEYS IS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THE QUICKNESS. HELLO DOLLY ON ON ON BEHALF OF HER SECOND SURE AS PART IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES HERE AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED NOW MODERATOR WILL MOVE TO OUR PHONE LINES AND SHIFTER. INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN FIFTY THREE. THEY TESTIFIED SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY THREE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. OUR FIRST TO GET ONLINE FORTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES HI THIS IS RATE GOING UP WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT. THE NEXT TO GO TO LINE TWENTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. SHARE MEMBERS RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU WANT TO AND IF YOU LIKE TO COMMENT. YOU LIKE TO COMMENT SUPPORTING IT PRESS ONE AND ZERO. AT THE TIME THERE'S NO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU MYSTERON MODERATOR NOW WILL GO TO OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES. ALL I MEAN I'M SORRY I'M SORRY WE'RE GOING TO OUR WITNESSES NOW IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- WE HAVE MISSION SURE AND WE HAVE. I AM ALWAYS GONNA MISS THE NAME OF THE SENATE PAYTON AGAIN SO THEY'RE READY THEY'LL- THEY MAY DO SO NOW. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS MY NAME IS GENET TWENTY FIFTEEN A HIGHLY CAL THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE ALLIANCE. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY AGAIN AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB TEN FIFTY THREE. FOR THE FAILED TO SPECIAL EFFECT NOW EXPAND DEATH OF WEEK FINALLY INJURY- CONCLUDED HIMSELF. AND MANAGERS ARE GIVING AWAY CONTROL SUBSTANCE. EPA INTERNATIONAL. PROMOTING DRUG POLICIES GRAVITY SCIENCE COMPASSION HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS. ORGANIZATION UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACT THAT DRUG YOU CAN HAVE A OF USERS. FAMILIES AND THOSE. WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE TO THE OVER- HOWEVER IF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE- WOULD NOT REDUCE YOUR- OR USE KNOW NO PREVENT- OVERDOSE. IN IT WOULD UNDERMINE AFTER. TO ADDRESS CRISIS DRIVING WHO USE DRUGS AWAY FROM HEALTH SERVICES AND ENCOURAGE MORE WITH YOUR TRACKING ACTIVITY TO AVOID DETECTION OR PROSECUTION. FOR FINANCIAL EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT CRIMINAL PENALTIES DO NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON REDUCING EITHER THE SUPPLY OF DRUGS OR THE DEMAND FOR THEM. INCREASING PENALTIES FOR FENTANYL RELATED SUBSTANCES ECHOES THE FAILED WAR OCT UP POLICIES ENACTED DURING THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES ABOUT CRACK COCAINE THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED PEOPLE OF COLOR. OVERCROWDED PRISONS. ACROSS LIFE. THE US COMMISSION FOUND NEARLY SO PERCENT OF THOSE PERFECT. ANALOGUES WERE BLACK OR MATTE NEXT DESPITE THE RECENT EMERGENCE OF FENNEL IN THE LEGAL MARKET LENGTHY SENTENCES HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR DECADES YET HAVE NOT STOPPED THE SPREAD OF SENTINEL AND THREATENED TO EXACERBATE. RACIAL DISPARITIES WITHIN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN NOVEMBER THIS YEAR THE CDC FOUND. THAT WE HAVE LOST OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND GAS IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD ENDING IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AGAIN THIS IS FURTHER PROOF THAT THE ENFORCEMENT FIRST APPROACH IS TO DRUGS ARE NOT WORKING AND IN FACT CRIMINALIZATION CONTINUE TO FUEL OVER CRISIS. BY PUSHING PEOPLE INTO AGAIN MORE RISKY SITUATION ISOLATION AND MAKING THE DRUG SUPPLY UNREGULATED AND UNSAFE. SB TEN FIFTY THREE AND A GOOD POSITION OF HARSH PENALTIES FOR DISTRIBUTION COULD UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA GOOD SAMARITAN LAW LIFESAVING LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES IN CASE OF AN OVERDOSE. THE MOST COMMON REASON PEOPLE CITE FOR NOT CALLING NINE ONE ONE IN THE EVENT OF AN OVERDOSE. YOUR FEAR OF POLICE INVOLVEMENT RECOGNIZING THIS BARRIER. CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THIRTY NINE OTHER STATES AND- THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AFTER NINE ONE ONE GOOD SAMARITAN LAWS WHICH PROVIDE LIMITED IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION FOR DRUG RELATED OFFENSES. FOR THOSE WHO SEEK MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. BUT- BECAUSE THEY- WHAT PRIVATE IT'S KIND TO SAY THAT'S- THE FAILED INTO THE OF THE- I LOOK AT IT. CULTURE TO READ TRAVEL HA. BY MAKING BASED TREATMENT OF ON THE GRANT AND TEMPLE THAT HARM. REDUCTION POLICIES SUCH AS FACILITATING DIRECT CHECKING INCLUDING PROTECTING MACHINES AND NOT LOOK AT DRUG TESTING STRIPS. HI THERE ARE FIVE. ADULTERATED SUBSTANCES AND GETTING THE OPIOID OVERDOSE ANTIDOTE NALOXONE INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE MOST LIKELY TO BE PRESENT WHEN A PERSON IS SUFFERING FROM AN OVERDOSE. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO INCARCERATE OUR WAY OUT OF THE OVERDOSE CRISIS AND MUST RESPOND TO THIS CRISIS DISSOLUTION. THAT OUR FAITH IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND. GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE RIGHT. FORTY THREE THE PA OR JUST NO VOTE ON AT. FIFTY YOUR- Q. NOW WE'RE MEANT MORE ON TO- KATHY SURE. GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN MEMBERS KATHY SURE FOR ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION WE RESPECTFULLY MASAKO OPPOSE SB TEN FIFTY THREE AM I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT THAT I THINK THAT THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- NEED A RATHER COMPELLING CASE FOR DECRIMINALIZATION OF VARIOUS KINDS OF JOBS BECAUSE- IF YOU WANT TO STOP SELLERS FROM ADULTERATED THEIR PRODUCT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO BRING. TO REGULATE THEM AND THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE UNDER THE EXISTING. THAT SAID. OF COURSE WE SHARE THE GOAL OF STOPPING THE DEATHS THAT WERE SEEN HAPPENING FROM PEOPLE TAKING DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN ADULTERATED WITH. UNFORTUNATELY THE IMPOSITION OF THE SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS PROPOSED IN SB TEN FIFTY THREE RUNS EXACTLY COUNTER TO WHAT WE KNOW WOULD WORK TO. REDUCE INJURIES AND DEATHS STEMMING FROM DRUG USE. WE KNOW THAT IN HOLDING SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS DO NOT WORK TO STOP PEOPLE FROM SELLING DRUGS OR SELLING ADULTERATED DRUGS OR FOR THAT MATTER FROM ENGAGING IN ANY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWS THAT INCREASED SENTENCES DO NOT HAVE A DETERRENT. INSTEAD THE INCREASED LENGTH OF SENTENCES NOT ONLY HARM THE PERSON SUBJECT TO THE SENTENCE BUT ALSO THAT FOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. THE POINTLESSNESS OF IMPOSING THESE ENHANCEMENTS AS PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS HERE WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCEMENT LIKE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE DRUGS THEY HAVE PROVIDED TO SOMEONE WERE ADULTERATED. SENTINEL GENERALLY ADDED TO OTHER DRUGS EARLY IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS- SO INCREASING SENTENCES FOR LOW LEVEL STREET DEALERS WHO DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE SELLING AND ADULTERATED PRODUCT WILL DO NOTHING TO AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE UPSTREAM DEALERS. WHO ARE THE ONES ACTUALLY ADDING THE SENTINEL TO OTHER STUFF. THE TRAGEDY HERE IS THAT WE KNOW WHAT WORKS TO COMBAT THE HARMS OF DRUG MISUSE. TREATMENT WORK HEALTH AND HARM REDUCTION SERVICES WORK. IMPOSING LONGER SENTENCES OF THE PROPOSED IN SB TEN FIFTY THREE WAIT. WAIT RESOURCES THAT COULD BE SPENT ON THOSE SERVICES. AND BY FURTHER DECRIMINALIZING DRUG USE DRIVES PEOPLE AWAY FROM THESE SERVICES BUT THEY- WE WERE. ASK FOR YOUR TELEPHONE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED WHO WISH T TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE SP TEN FIFTY THREE. SEEING NONE WILL MOVE TO OUR PHONE LINES- MODERATOR CAN YOU QUEUE UP ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF US THREE TEN FIFTY THREE. SURE- IF YOU LIKE TO COME IN OPPOSITION YOUR PRESS ONE OF THE- AT THIS TIME- WILL DECLINE A FIFTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU FOR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD. HI I'M. STRONG OPPOSITION THANK THANK YOU NEPTUNUS THE NEXT TO GO TO LINE THIRTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. REGNI ON BEHALF OF AN ISSUE DRASTIC AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MEXICO TO LINE TWELVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. BUT DON'T USE THEM FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT TO LINE FIFTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. DANIEL GUTIERREZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. UNEXPLODED LINE FORTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. WILL BE LUNCH FROM THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN PRISONERS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR NOW WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE OTHER ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO SB TEN FIFTY THREE. SKINNER COMMA. THANK YOU I JUST I HAD A QUESTION MAYBE THE- THOSE ON THE LINE- COULD ADDRESS IT. I WAS WONDERING AND I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND THIS AND THAT AND THAT TAX THROUGH THE ANALYSIS. DOES THIS BILL DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SOMEONE THAT IS KNOWINGLY SELLING. WITH THE INTENT TO HARM OR KNOWINGLY SELLING A DRUG OR KNOWING THAT IT IS LACED WITH FENNEL. AND HAVING SOMEONE WHO'S JUST SELLING WITHOUT KNOWING THAT SOMETHING IS LACED WITH FENTANYL WERE SELLING WITHOUT THE INTENT TO HARM DOESN'T MAKE THOSE JUST STING WISH SAYING. DOES THAT INCLUDE THOSE KINDS OF DISTINGUISHES. THE WORD. I THINK OF THE QUESTION ACTED SIGNATURE QUESTION NO IT DOES NOT MAKE THOSE DISTINCTIONS AT THE ROYAL COURT CASE TO CALIFORNIA'S SUPREME COURT DIDN'T MAKE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN PERSONAL INFO IS STRIVING PERSONAL CONNECTION BETWEEN MINISTERING RUG IN FURNISHING A DRUG AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL- ADDRESSES IS THAT DISTINCTION PREVIOUSLY WE ABLE TO CHARGE A PUBLIC TO TWO POINT SEVEN ALLEGATIONS THIS SET DECISION- IT PACKS ARE GOING TO DO THAT YOU AGES THAT THE POINT EARLIER ABOUT HOW ALCOHOL IS TREATED AND THIS CALL TWO TWO POINT SEVEN ALLEGATION IS USING ALCOHOL CASES COURT FOR DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. SO IF THERE IS HARMONY DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE CASE EQUAL TO TWO POINT SEVEN ALLEGATION CAN BE A LEGEND IS COMMONLY ELECTION SO WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME PARITY THAT WOULD BE THAT THIS ALLEGATION THIS TOOL COULD BE USED IN A FELONY DUI CASES AS WELL AS A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE FELONY. HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. IT DOES THANK ALTHOUGH I ARGUE THE IT DOESN'T STOP PEOPLE FROM DRINKING AND DRIVING IT AND CERTAINLY INCREASES. THE COST AND THE PENALTIES AND CREATES ADDITIONAL BARRIERS BUT I DO APPRECIATE- THAT RESPONSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEED THERE'S NO QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BY THE COMMITTEE. I MEAN TO NONE CENTER VEGETAL THANK YOU HOUSE. SORRY YES I JUST WANT IT TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT THE BILL DOESN'T ADD ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS IT SIMPLY OVERTURNS THE IF ALLEGEDLY LEGISLATIVE FIX FOR THE ALLERGY CASE AND- ON THE ISSUE OF CAUSATION REQUIREMENT IS SIMPLY STATES THAT PERSONAL INFLICTION WILL INCLUDE THE SELLING FURNISHING ADMINISTERING AND GIVING AWAY A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE THE PROSECUTION IS STILL REQUIRED TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE DEFENDANT SOLD FURNISHED ADMINISTER GAVE AWAY THOSE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING. THAT IT WOULD INJURY JUST LIKE WITH THE SALE OF ALCOHOL AND- LIQUOR STORE SO- KNOWING THAT A LEGISLATIVE FIX IS KIND OF A SIMPLE WAY TO ENSURE THAT THE CONSEQUENCE THAT'S CURRENTLY THERE. IN THIS PENAL CODE REMAINS AND- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONSEQUENCES- SB TEN SIXTY DIDN'T MAKE OF THIS A CONSEQUENCE BILL THAT'S CURRENTLY OF CONSEQUENCE PENAL CODE THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PLACE SENATE FINANCE MEANT THREE YEARS NO CHANGE JUST MAKING SURE THAT THE CAUSATIVE. OF PERSONAL INFLICTION- CAN BE FOUND WHEN SOMEONE ACTUALLY IS APPROVED A PURVEYOR OF- ONE OF THESE DRUGS SO WITHOUT AYE. I URGE YOU TO GIVE AN IDOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WERE SEEKING IN MOTION A TO DO PASS FIRST AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SO MOVED. BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR TO A BALK. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL INDUSTRY GEN FIFTY THREE. SB TEN FIFTY THREE DO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS BRADFORD. BRADFORD NOT VOTING A TROLL BOGUE I HAD TROUBLE GUY COME LONGER NO FROM LONGER KNOWS SKINNER. WINNER WINNER NO. THE MEASURE HAS WON VOTERS TO KNOWS WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR THAT SOME MEMBERS AND IF IT DOESN'T HOUSE LIKE. IN OTHERS ASKING FOR RECONSIDERATION WE WILL GRAB THAT NOW WE'RE MOVING IN SB NINE OLD FOUR. AND THIS IS THE EDUCATION COMPONENT OF MY BILL PACKAGE TODAY AND I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB NINE OH FOUR WHICH CLARIFIES THE STANDARDS OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE EDUCATION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR DIVERSITIES OF PROBATIONERS AND PRISONERS WITH STRUGGLE CALIFORNIA ADDITIONAL ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS BATTLING. SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS ARE RECEIVING PROPER TREATMENT AND EDUCATION CURRENT LAW REQUIRES PROBATIONERS AND DIVERT TO USED TO COMPLETE EDUCATION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS UPON CONVICTION OF A DRUG ABUSE RELATED OFFENSE HOWEVER DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF THESE PROGRAMS IS VERY VAGUE AND UNDEFINED THE AMBIGUITY IN THE LAW LEAVES MANY PROBATIONERS AND DIVERSITIES WITH LITTLE DIRECTION FOR EDUCATION OR TREATMENT OPTIONS THAT ADDRESS SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND HELP THEM WITH THEIR ADDICTIONS SO SB NINE OH FOUR WOULD REMOVE THE M. YOU GUIDED AMBIGUITY AND REQUIRE PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE EDUCATION ON THE DANGERS OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES UNLESS OF COURSE THEY ARE TAKEN UNDER APPROPRIATE MEDICAL SUPERVISION. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THESE EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO INFORM PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ABOUT THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN WITH EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS ON THE GRAVE HEALTH RISK TO THOSE WHO INGEST OR OR OR ARE EXPOSED TO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ALONG WITH THE EXTREME DANGER. TO HUMAN LIFE WHEN SAID DRUGS ARE MANUFACTURED OR DISTRIBUTED IT IS VITAL THAT WE TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS THE OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA SB NINE OH FOUR IS THE SIMPLE PREVENTIVE MEASURE THAT ACCOMPLISHES THIS WE HAVE INTRODUCED AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT WHO DESIGNS AND IMPLEMENTS. THE APPROVAL PROCESS. FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE THAT YOU CATION IS WELL AS THE OF THE PROGRAM. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO REMOVE OF SOMETHING THAT WAS A QUITE OBJECTIONABLE THAT'S THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND AGGRAVATION THAT HAS BEEN REMOVED- THROUGH AN AMENDMENT. FURTHERMORE THE NEW LANGUAGE WILL OF REFLECT THAT AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY WHICH PASSED. UNANIMOUSLY IN THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE THIS PAST WEEK.

AS CENTER KAMATA MENTIONED THERE THERE ARE THREE APPROACHES EDUCATION TREATMENT CONSEQUENCES AND SB NINE OH FOUR FOCUSES ON PROVIDING EDUCATION TREATMENT INDIVIDUALS PLACED ON PROBATION FOR A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE OFFENSE THE EDUCATION WOULD INCLUDE LECTURES CLASSES GOOD DISCUSSION AND COUNSELLING THE GOAL OF THE EDUCATION TREATMENT TO STOP CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SAVE A LIFE BY EDUCATING INDIVIDUALS. IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ABOUT THE RISKS AND DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES SUCH AS THE ALARMING INCREASE IN THE LEGALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF FAKE PRESCRIPTION PILLS I THINK THAT NOW.

PROVIDED BY A COURT ORDER ALSO THE BILL WOULD GET ALL COMMITTEE APPROVAL FOR THOSE PROGRAMS USE OF THE COUNTY SURVATION DEPARTMENT IN CONJUNCTION- WITH- THE COUNTY DRUG OUR PROGRAM COORDINATOR- OUR CONCERN IS THAT YOU KNOW PROBATION COULD NOT BE THE ONE TO CREATING DRUG EDUCATION. PROGRAMS AND FAILED- YOU ARE HERE TO GUIDELINES FOR WHAT TYPE OF PROGRAM OR PROVIDERS- THEY CAN CHOOSE THEIR WORK WHERE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT VOLUNTARINESS AND PARTICIPANTS BY AN ARC HE COULD BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT EFFORT IS A BETTER OUTCOME NARROWING OPTIONS AND REPEATING.

IT THE OVERDOSE CRISIS INSTEAD OF FURTHERING HARMFUL BACTERIA BUDGET YOU RECOMMEND OF THE STATE AND- FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL YOU FIVE TO PRIORITIZE THE EXPANSION OF ACCESS TO EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT VOLUNTARY FOR THE FUTURE REPORTER TREATMENT AND HARM REDUCTION SERVICES LIKE OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND ACCESS TO OTHER HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT HAVE A HANDS OF TREATMENT PROVIDERS SHOULD BE FREE TO PURSUE BUT EVEN OPTIONS BASED ON SCIENCE AND- THE PROPHETIC.

AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB NINE ZERO FOUR WE DO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR REMOVING ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT FROM THIS BILL. AS THE DEFENDER OF THE INDIGENT DEFENDANTS FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS I HAD TO LEARN A LOT ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER THE TREATMENT OF SUCH AND WHAT LEADS TO THE EXCEPT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. FIRST AND FOREMOST I LEARNED THAT VOLUNTARINESS AND PARTICIPANTS BY AND ARE THE KEYS TO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT A PERSON SUFFERING FROM SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER MUST BE READY TO ACCEPT TREATMENT. I ALSO LEARNED THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN DIFFERENT MANNERS OF TREATMENT FROM ONE ANOTHER WE MUST NOT NARROW OPTIONS OR DICTATE THE APPROACH A PROGRAM MUST. WE MUST GIVE THE LEAD HERE COURTS HAVE FLEXIBILITY. MUST HAVE FLEXIBILITY- AS RECEPTION ABUSE IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS TREATMENT PROVIDERS MUST BE FREE TO FOLLOW EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AS WELL AS WORK WITH THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF BOTH COUNCILLORS AND THE PEOPLE THEY WORK WITH. WELL THE FOR POST BILL IS WELL INTENTIONED IT'S NOT THE ANSWER TO OUR TERRIBLE OF YOUR HEART CRISIS OR EVEN PART OF THE ANSWER WE NEED TO LOOK TO THE EVIDENCE BASED AND CLINICALLY PROVEN STANDARDS.

ANY OF THE KARAGANDY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S PRETTY LITTLE JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE. THANK YOU NOW WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS CENTER WINNER. THANK I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SO I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS EITHER ONE CLARIFICATION ON I'VE I AM I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. BRING YOUR BILL FOR THE FOCUSES ON ON TREATMENT- AND I KNOW IT THEY'RE NOT IMPRINT BUT I THINK I'VE I'VE SEEN- MEMBERS OF THE AUTHOR INTENDS TO TAKE. THE BASIC CONFORM THE BILL TO A. B. R. SEVENTEEN FIFTY- INTO THAT. DEFINITELY THE MERGERS OF ONE OF MY CONCERNS WITH WAS THE CRIMINALIZATION AND IF YOU DON'T. SUCCEED SO THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO REMOVE THAT- BUT THE- THE TWO OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR A BILL IN THE FIRST THANK THE KIND OF TREATMENT. AND THEN THE I THINK THE REQUIREMENT FOR SUCCESSFULLY. TREATING IS ALSO GOING TO BE IN THE BILL. THAT THAT REALLY REFERS SENATOR WINNER JUST COMPLETING THE PROGRAM IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL SUCCESSFUL AS DEFINED MEANS THAT YOU TOOK ARE YOU COMPLETED THE PROGRAM OKAY WHY I'M SO I'M SERVICE SO WHAT HAPPENS IF. IF YOU COULD WE KNOW LIKE AS MUCH AS WE WANT PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW PUT THE NOSE THE GRINDSTONE AND- UNDERSTANDING FROM WHAT SO IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO IS. DEEPLY ADDICTED AND THEY GOT PUT INFORMATION AND SENSE ONE OF THE RIVER MET MANDATED TO A TREATMENT PROGRAM. UNLESS HAVE A FALL OUT BECAUSE THEY START USING MAYBE THEY WERE. BECAUSE THEY WERE THEY WERE DELAYING THE ARREST OF ANOTHER USING AND THEY FALL OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM OF THEIR FALL OUT. NOTHING MEANS IF THE L. WHATEVER THEY'VE BACK BEFORE THE JUDGE HE HAS THE DISCRETION ON THE KIND OF TREATMENT I THINK THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING THAT THE BILL LIMITS THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE IT DOES NOT OF COURSE SO PERHAPS STARTING THE TREATMENT PROGRAM ALL OVER AGAIN SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY. A CONTRITE THAT THEY FELL OFF. THE WAGON AND- YOU. GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. BOB EVANS THE LOSS FROM. AND NOW THING THAT. A MISCARRIAGE. BY THE OP. ON THERE. YOU TOO AMENDMENTS SO THERE'S A WHOLE CAL. OF INTO. WHO ARE A TREATMENT BAY. SCIENCE BAY WHO ARE NOW PART OF THE DECISION OF WHAT THE EDUCATION PROGRAM IS GOING TO INCLUDE. SO IT IS NOT MANDATED THAT IT HAS TO BE A CERTAIN KIND IN FACT. ALL THE TREATMENT PROVIDERS CAN I DETERMINE THAT THAT I THINK THE EDUCATION COMPONENT OF IT. OUR SHOULD BE INCLUDED. IS INCLUDED WITH THIS BILL. GET TO THE TITLE TREATMENT I DO HAVE ABOUT. BUT JUST IN TERMS OF A NOTS. COMPLETING BECAUSE THAT IS REFERRED TO IN HERE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION- BUT I ONE OF. THE WILL THIS INCREASE. THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMEONE BEING CAR SERRATED SO THEY GET THEY GET. PROBATION WITH THIS TREATMENT BASEBALL OFF OFF THE WAGON THERE ARE USING A GUN FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY'RE JUST NOT. YOU KNOW YOU CAN KIND OF JUDGES I'M I'M REVOKING HER PROBATION SENDING YOU TO JAIL. YOU KNOW LESS ALKALINE FOR SMITH I DON'T SEE THAT AS PART OF THIS BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY STATED IN THE BILL THAT SUCCESS MEANS THEY COMPLETED THE PROGRAM WHY THEY'RE ON PROBATION. ALL IF YOU ARE INCARCERATED YOU'RE REQUIRED TO TAKE IT IS PART OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IF YOU ARE IN PRISON BUT THOSE WHO ARE AYE DIVERT HE'S CENTERS RUN% PROBATION YOU'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE THE PROGRAM AND YOU HAVE JUST SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE IT. MEANS YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE ENTIRE COURSE THE GATE AND THEN LET'S SAY YOU WERE SITTING AND WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU THEN ARE WITHOUT BE THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION I WOULD ASSUME SO. I WOULD HE WOULD MAKE THE PERSON TAKE THE COURSE AGAIN WOULD HE INCREASE- THE TIME IF YOU YOU KNOW YOU ARE. YOU'RE YOU'VE VIOLATED YOUR PROBATION YOU VIOLATE YOUR PROBATION BY NOT GOING TAKING THE TREAT THE- THE PROGRAM THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUR PROBATION IS AWAITED. I DON'T THINK THERE'S- ROBERT HI WITH YEAH COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THE JUDGE HAS THE- HE DEEMS SOMEONE HAVING. COMPLETED A EVEN IF THE THING ACTUALLY COMPLIED WITH IT- FEDERAL COMPLETION HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE LANGUAGE IMPACTED- IT'S A TERM OF ART THE VIEWS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM EVERY DAY TO DETERMINE. WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE IS COMPLYING WITH PROBATION THE COURT HAS- THE JURISDICTION AND THE DISCRETION TO ORDER INTO A NEW PROGRAM OR TO SIMPLY FIND HEY I YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED IT. IF YOU SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED WITH THAT TERMINATE ATTEMPTED TREATMENT- THEN THE COURT CAN BE MET THAT IF I CAN FIND NO VIOLATION OR EVEN. TERMINATE THEM FROM PROBATION ACTUALLY EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED IT YEAH I'M JUST I GUESS THE ISSUE IS ANYONE WHO HAS A PROVISION. OF THE RECIDIVIST THERE ARE DIFFERENT. IN YOU CAN VIOLATE SECOND. CAUSE A PROBATE GROUP AND YOU GO TO THAT'S SIX SAYS. MY QUESTION IS WHETHER WE ARE NOW PUTTING ONE ADDITIONAL WAY. FOR THE PERSONNEL THAT HAVE THEIR PROBATION BE REVOKED AND GOING TO JAIL THAT DOESN'T EXIST NOW AND THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO MANDATE. THREE MEN AS PART OF PROBATION. AS A DOES IT CREATE YET ONE MORE BASIS TO REVOKE PROBATION IN AN INCARCERATED PERSON. YOU KNOW IT DID NOT GET CONVICTED THAT REQUIREMENT IS ALREADY PUT IN PLACE AFTER A COURT ORDER TO ORDER EDUCATION OR TREATMENT. THE PROBLEM WITH THE WAY THE CURRENT LAW IF THAT UP. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT IT PUTS THE ONUS ON IT ON A DEFENDANT. WHO'S GOING ON PROBATION THE FEET AND MAINTAIN THEIR OWN TREATMENT. THAT THAT PART ABOUT THAT IS THAT OFTENTIMES IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TREATMENT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY PUTS THE ONUS BACK WHERE IT BELONGS WHICH IS BACK ON THE GOVERNMENT. TO FIND APPROPRIATE TREATMENTS FOR THE ATTIC NUMBER ONE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF RECOVERING FROM THE ADDICTION AND TRY TO FIND THEIR OWN TREATMENT. AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY SPEAKING TO- INSURER IS THE ONE WHO GOES INTO COURT IN SANTA MONICA HOW. IN COMPTON HAS A ON THIS. THE COURT. DO YOU. THE MOBILE THEM- BUT RIGHT NOW AS IT CURRENTLY THE CORE IS THE TO ORDER A- SO DEFINITELY IT DOESN'T A NEW- KITTED MEASURE WE IT CAN TO DOES THIS. FIRST OF ALL IT UP DATE OKAY BECAUSE AND TREATMENT PARKER WITH MY CRACKED AND ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IS TO HAVE TO TREATMENT EDUCATION BUT BUT IF THAT'S IF THE ISSUE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE ON THEIR OWN NOW TO FIND WHATEVER TREATMENT THEY CAN FIND WE WANT CONSISTENCY AND WHAT. THE VERY COUNTIES TO BE PROVIDING THAT WOULD IN THE BILLS. AS REQUIRED COUNTIES TO. THE EXPIRES THE- TREATMENT I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED CONSUMERS THIS IS CREATING A NEW. PROBATION A NEW ELEMENT OF PROBATION. SO IT DOES NOT CREATE A NEW ELEMENT TO PROBATION ALREADY CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE CURRENT CODE. WHAT IT DOES IS MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE WHERE IS RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING ON THE DEFENDANT IT IF POSSIBLE. BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS IT IS CURRENTLY IN THE COLD THAT THE COURT SHALL IF IT IS AVAILABLE THAT THIS COURT SHALL ORDER A DEFENDANT I COULD PARTICIPATE IN AN EDUCATION OR TREATMENT PROGRAM. OKAY BUT I'M NOT ELECTED NOT AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE RIGHT THANK YOU ON MY SECOND- QUESTIONS ABOUT. THE TYPE OF TREATMENT AND I- I AM. SENSITIVE TO MY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE DECIDED BY THE- PROBATION DEPARTMENT. OR WHATEVER AND I. WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY TREATMENT IS COME TRULY BE SCIENCE BASED AND M. AND FOR EXAMPLE LIKE. ABSENCE ONLY HE DOESN'T WORK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY WORK FOR SOME PEOPLE- BUT DOESN'T WORK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND IT SETS THEM UP FOR. FOR VALUE THAT'S WHY I'M I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE ARGUMENTS RAISED BY THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE OUT HERE FOR A LOT OF HARM REDUCTION IS GOING TO BE. WHAT BERKSTEN TERMS GETTING PEOPLE UNIT STOP USING OR TO USE LESS OR TO BE. SAFER AND HOW THEY- USE SO CAN YOU COMMENT ON ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING THESE AMENDMENTS. WHO WILL BE DECIDING WHAT. THE TREATMENT AS- OF WHAT EXACT AGENCY OR OFFICIAL. AND WHAT. ARE THEIR IS THERE A BILL OR AS IS A DISCUSSION CABINS IN SOME WAY OR CAN THEY- DECIDE I'M GOING WITH APPS ONLY FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE IN. NO I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR WIENER AYE TO- GIVING IT JUST OF THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT WE TOOK AN AMENDMENT WHEN I SAW THAT BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THE TREATMENT PROVIDERS. WHO ARE VERY INVOLVED WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT BEST PRACTICES NEW METHODS ARE HAVE TO BE PART OF IT SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WILL COME THERE TO DETERMINE WHAT SPECIFICALLY THE STANDARDISATION OF THIS PROGRAM. IS ABOUT AND THAT WAY IT WOULD BE STANDARDIZED AND IS VERY BIG NOW IS YOU. HIGHTOWER EXPLAINED SO IT IS LAWS SPECIFICALLY AMENDED AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IN THE BILL NOW BECAUSE OF THE LATE AMEND THAT WE WERE PUTTING IT TOGETHER BUT IT'S INTENDED TO. BE AMENDED SO THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS AND IT IT IS SAKE- COLLABORATIVE PROCESSES YOU LOOK AT THOSE VERY THINGS YOU PRODUCT SCIENCE BASED. BASED BEST PRACTICE WITH THOSE I'M SORRY REALISTICALLY MAYBE IF IT'S IF IT'S IN THE BILL I APOLOGIZE I MUST HAVE MISSED IT BUT I. I KNOW THERE WERE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT ARE NOT IN THE BILL YEAH. IN THIS ONE SAYS SPECIFICALLY OF THE RESPONSIBILITY WILL BE- ON STATE THE A MEMBER STATE OF THE COUNTY DRUG PROGRAM AN ADMINISTRATOR. REPRESENT IS THAT THE COURT THE CONFIRMATION. DEPARTMENT SINCE YOU. PROVIDED WITH DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT AN APPROVAL AND RENEWAL PROCESS FOR THE EDUCATION TREATMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRE MACABE DRUG PROGRAM AND I'M SORRY DO SO. NOW I POLITICS YEAH CAN BE PROGRAM STRIP. IS THAT WHAT THEY HAVE POST ARE YOU. LIKE HEALTH- OUT AGENCY OKAY OKAY IS NOT AN OFFICIAL. VETR LIKE DEFINITE. IT MAY ON A DRUG PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR MAY BE THEY HAVE THOSE NOW I'M NOT FRANKLY I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE COUNTIES I KNOW THAT. THEIR SITE THERE IS THE SPECIFICITY THAT'S NOW GIVEN TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS BASICALLY RUNNING THOSE DRUG EDUCATION PROGRAMS. CAN WE JUST HAVE AG COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE- THE MOST RATE OR WHATEVER THE- I JUST- I'M JUST A LITTLE IS VERY LITTLE LOOSE AND I WORRY THAT THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES. DEPENDING ON WHO PARTICIPATES IN IT IT'S UNCLEAR WHO ACTUALLY pMAKES THE FINAL DECISION AND WHAT PROVIDERS ARE BOB THERE ARE REALLY REALLY GOOD- US OF THESE TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK ON THIS OR SOME REAL SHADY. OPERATORS AND THEIR PEOPLE TO USE NON SCIENCE BASED DEPENDING ON WHAT COUNTY IS AN UNFORTUNATE IN THE COUNTIES. THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE YOU KNOW PURSUING HARSHER DRUG PENALTIES ARE ALSO THE ONES. THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE PURSUING OPTIONS ONLY- OR ABSTINENCE FOCUSED ON JUST CALL AND POINTED OUT IT'S I THINK THE REALITY- AND SO I THINK THIS. WOULD BE SOME TIGHTENING FELT THE LONG TO SHORT IS THE MMC MADE UP HERE. MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I REALLY APPRECIATE APPRECIATE IT- I THINK WITH THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT TIGHT ENOUGH FOR ME AND I WORRY THAT I COULD GO. NOT BE IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY AND SO IF BROUGH WITH BOAT. THIS LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW I THINK I DON'T THINK I COULD SUPPORT TODAY IF IT WERE TO LEAD TO A FUTURE HEARING. WITH SOME MORE WORK ON THE LANGUAGE- I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THERE SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT. I WILL LAUGH AT THIS BECAUSE IT'S IDENTICAL TO THE LANGUAGE THAT IN THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION STATUTE- THAT IS ESSENTIALLY IT'D BE COUNTY DRUG ADMINISTRATOR WITH INPUT FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROVIDERS UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION TWELVE ELEVEN. BILL WAS PUT IN THERE TO NEARTHAT BUT THAT WAY ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HAD A STAKE. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT PROGRAM SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE USED FOR DRUG DIVERSION. SO IN THOSE OTHER ONES IN THE DECIDER IS- HE THOUGHT WERE THAT CERTAIN FORMER PRESIDENT OR THE DECISION MAKER. IS THE DRUG PROGRAM COUNTY DRUG PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR. BECAUSE HERE THAT THEY'RE NOT THE DECISION MAKER. IT'S LIKE A CELL THEIR PROCESS. WITH PROBATE APART EVERYONE ELSE IT DOESN'T WHO DECIDES. ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE ON PROBATION AS WELL OF THE COURT BUT THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES WILL BE WILL BE DEVELOPED- BY THE COUNTY DRUG ADMINISTRATOR WITH INPUT FROM THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. TREATMENT PROVIDERS SO AGAIN IT'S GONNA EXACTLY NEAR RIGHT NOW WHAT WE HAVE IN THE DRUG DIVERSION STATUTE. SO THAT WAY IF THE SAME TYPE OF TREATMENT PROGRAMS THEY'RE GONNA BE PROVIDED AS A BEING PROVIDED A DIVERSION. SO THAT AND AGAIN PROBATION WOULD ULTIMATELY BE THE ONE WHO WOULD. BE AND LOCATE THOSE PROGRAMS FOR THE DEFENDANT BUT ULTIMATELY THE COURT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE DETERMINATION APPROPRIATE PROGRAM AT THE BEGINNING FROM A PROBATION. OKAY THANK YOU. CENTERS SKINNER. THANK YOU TO YOUR ARM. I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO. PUT INTO STATUTE CONTENT OF SUCH PROGRAMS BECAUSE THAT IS NOT OUR EXPERTISE. SAY THAT TO ESTABLISH DIVERSION PROGRAMS TO ESTABLISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT BUT TO DEFINE THE CURRICULUM OF IT IS NOT OUR EXPERTISE AND MY EXPERIENCE PASSED. THERE ARE PASSED STATUTES WHERE WE IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE DICTATED WHAT THE CURRICULUM WAS AND THEY HAVE A WORK. BECAUSE EXPERTISE AND THAT'S WHAT I TAKE FROM THE- SOME OF THE OPPOSITION NOT ALL IT'S NOT OUR DECISION TO TREATMENT PER SE IT IS TO DEFINING WHAT THAT. WHAT THE CURRICULUM IS OR HOW IT'S HOW IT IS DONE AND SO- AND IT SEEMS BECAUSE THE BILL PART OF IT'S MY MOTIVATION IS TO GET THAT VERY SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ABOUT FENTANYL OUT THERE- AGAIN I WANT PEOPLE TO BE AWARE FEDERAL THOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR. MECHANISM IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO FOR US TO PUT INTO STATUTE DATE THE CURRICULUM OF THE PROGRAM SO I'M I CAN'T SUPPORT IT AS WRITTEN. I DON'T SEE THAT WE PUT INTO STATUTE A CURRICULUM WE PUT INTO STATUTE- A- PROCESS BY WHICH THEY WILL DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE CORDS- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW SENTENCING AND JOG. FOR THEIR VERSION- IF OF A PROGRAM THAT PEOPLE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THEM BUT WE'RE NOT SAYING IT HAS TO BE EXPLAINS THE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE CONTENT AS I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR TREATMENT PROVIDERS TO HAVE A GREAT IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ON BEING ON BEST PRACTICES. OF THINGS THAT ARE ARE WORKING SCIENCE BASED AND OUT AND THAT'S NOT EVEN CALLED OUT IN HERE JUST SPECIFICALLY SAYS THESE EXPERTS NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT IS AVAILABLE YES BUT I ALSO FIND SOUND DEFINES THE NUMBER OF HOURS TO DEFINE DEFINES A VARIETY OF THINGS WHICH IN EFFECT. WELL MAYBE IT'S NOT THE TOTAL CONTENT IS STILL IT IS STILL GOING INTO AN ARENA OF DEFINITIONS THAT IS NOT OUR EXPERTISE. IN MY OPINION. MA'AM BASED ON THE LEVEL OF A RATING THIS THAT I SEEM IT SEEMS EXIST RIGHT NOW WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED SENATOR BATES IF WE JUST PUT THIS OFF FOR ANOTHER WEEK AND LET YOU FINE TUNE THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE KINDA HE'S OUR OUR MEMBERS CONCERNS YES I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT AND WORK WITH SENATOR WINNER BECAUSE I THINK THE THINGS THAT HE HAS BROUGHT UP ARE VERY RELEVANT AND CONCERN ELEVEN YEAH THANK YOU AND OUR PRICES AS GOOD MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFF TO BE VERY. INVOLVED IS WHAT WHATEVER CURRENT LAW IS MAYBE THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S NOT TIGHT ENOUGH AND SO I JUST MIGHT YEAH RABITA TO TAKE A SIDE RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION WILL JUST HOLD THIS- ITEM OVER TO OUR NEXT HEARING OR TO OPPORTUNITY A FEW HEARINGS DOWN TO THE APPLE TIME TO WORK NOT. ONLY WITH COMMITTEE STAFF BUT WITH- THE BRIDGE TO MAKE SURE OUR- WE GET. THAT EVERY COME WITH THANK YOU OKAY YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU SENATOR BYRD FOR YOUR TESTIMONY GIVEN BACK THANK YOU. THE OUR MEMBERS NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM AND- IT'S- BY SENATOR. SKINNER SB. NINE SIX ZERO. YOU ENTERED YEAH. NINE SIX ZERO. ALL. PEOPLE.

BUT PEOPLE ENTER THEIR CADET PROGRAM THAT THEY THEN HEN COUNTERED THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO OFFER A POSITION TO THEM BECAUSE THERE IS- WE HAVE CURRENT PROVISION IN OUR LAW. THAT WOULD. RESTRICT THE ABILITY FOR A PERSON WHO IS NOT A CITIZEN BUT HAS LEGAL WORK AUTHORIZATION NOW WHEN I SAY LEGAL WORK AUTHORIZATION THAT MEANS FOR EXAMPLE A GREEN CARD. A VISA PERMANENT RESIDENCY VARIOUS THINGS THAT. WHILE ARE NOT CITIZENSHIP DO GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO LEGALLY WORK IN THE U. S. AND TO FOR EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA BE A MEMBER OF THE BAR SO PRACTICE LAW. YOU KNOW BUT PLATE HAVE- YOU PART OF. ANY NUMBER OF FORTY ONE PROFESSIONS WITHIN OUR BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR STATUTE AS WRITTEN YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE A PEACE OFFICER. AND SO WHAT MY BILL WOULD DO AND THERE'S A- IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR ANY PERSON WHO IS UNDOCUMENTED OR NON CITIZEN TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER THIS BILL IS SUCCESSFUL BUT RATHER. YOU MUST BE A PERSON IS LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO WORK. YOU HAVE THAT LEGAL PAPERWORK. AND THEN IN CALIFORNIA IF THIS BILL PASSES YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO BE A SWORN OFFICER. SO THAT'S ITS INTENT. AND THE- SO WE MIGHT SAY WELL WHY WOULD IT NOT BE WHY DON'T WE STILL REQUIRE THEM TO PURSUE CITIZENSHIP. BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S MANY REASONS WHY SOME PEOPLE DO NOT PURSUE CITIZENSHIP. THERE'S IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE FROM A COUNTRY THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO RETAIN YOUR YOUR EXISTING CITIZENSHIP A U. S. CITIZEN THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR PEOPLE BUT IN SOME COUNTRIES YOU HAVE TO DENOUNCE IT ENTIRELY. THERE'S ALSO- CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE I MEAN THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF CIRCUSTANCES WHERE SOMEONE CHOOSES TO RETAIN THE CITIZENSHIP OF THEIR HOME COUNTRY BUT THEY ARE PERMANENT RESIDENTS HERE. AND SO. THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR THEM TO BE. A SWORN OFFICER WHICH OF COURSE WOULD HELP US WITH THAT CULTURAL ISSUES DIVERSITY ISSUES IF YOU'VE GROWN UP IN- YOU KNOW CERTAIN COMMUNITY AND YOU WANT TO SERVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THE THIS PROVISION AND THE OTHER INTERESTING THING IS THIS PROVISION WAS NOT IN OUR LAW FROM THE TIME WE STARTED OUR- POLICE OFFICERS IT WAS ADDED. AND I HAVE DEEP TO FIND THE- OF GET TO THE YEAR IT WAS ADDED YOU KNOW SO WAS SEMI RECENTLY WITHIN THE LAST- TWENTY THE LAST THIRTY OR SO YEARS. ANYWAY I WANT TO HAVE MY- PEOPLE AND WHO ARE MY EXPERTS TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY BUT I WANTED TO RAISE THAT. WHEN WHEN WE GET INTO THE DISCUSSION THERE SPEND SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. WHAT WHAT WOULD THIS PREVENT SOMEONE FROM BEING ABLE TO TRUST TO GET A BACKGROUND CHECK AND BY NO MEANS IN MY TRYING TO CARRY A BILL THAT WOULD. CAUSE SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO BE A SWORN OFFICER WHO WE COULD NOT DO A BACKGROUND CHECK ON ME WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT MANY OF THE PROFESSIONS. THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE WERE LEGALLY AVAILABLE TO WORK THEY HAD TO PASS BACKGROUND CHECKS SO I KNOW THAT THERE IS A WAY THAT WE CAN CONSTRUCT THIS THAT WOULD GIVE THE ABILITY FOR. A PERSON WHO IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL WITH THAT CHANGE IN LAW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WOULD HAVE TO WOULD BE BE. ABLE TO HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK DONE ON THEM IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SO I AM TOTALLY WILLING TO WORK ON MAKING SURE THAT. IF THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE FIX IT AS WE MOVE FORWARD BUT LET ME GO TO- MICHAEL BIGARD FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND JONATHON. FELDMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS. THIS ARE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND THEN WILL BE FOLLOWED BY MR FELDMAN WITH TWO MINUTES AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MICHAEL BUT ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. YOU SEE IF PROUD TO SPONSOR SENATE BILL NINE FIFTY WHICH WOULD DELAY THANK YOU CREDIT REQUIREMENTS. FOR BEEF UP JUST TO BE OUT THERE WITHIN. THE UNIVERSITY. SPONSORED THE BILL BECAUSE AS WITH THE LETTER EXPLAINED. WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN OUR CADET PROGRAM WHEN CAMPUS POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONE TALK ABOUT WHAT. WE OFFER ADDITIONAL UC DAVIS HE- WAS INELIGIBLE THERE HAS UNDOCUMENTED STATUS. BACK EVERY YEAR WE HAVE OUTSTANDING COULD ACT LIKE THAT WE CANNOT HIRE. NINETY NINE IF YOU ARE MOVING THE FAIR WHICH IS GROUNDED IN ALLOCATED THINKING ANSWERS NOW GOING TO BY LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE. YOU ALSO A LINE CALIFORNIA WITH ALMOST EVERY OTHER STATES BY ELIMINATING THE ANTIQUATED THINKING FROM THE WALL. AND ALLOW ANY QUALIFIED RESIDENT TO CALIFORNIA SERVICE DO YOU THINK YOU MEAN IT IS. WHAT THEY WERE. RATE AND YOU CAN WITHIN LESS. WE NEED TO EVEN USE THE AMHERST. REQUEST YOUR I. AND IT'S ONLINE SIX. THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN. SURE JONATHAN FOR WITH STRATEGY ON BEHALF THE POLICE TO THIS. AND SUPPORTED- OR TO START BY OF POLICE CHIEF CENTERS THE COME OF THIS ISSUES AND FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAWS AND LAWS AROUND FIREARM POSSESSION- BUT WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT BECAUSE THE CHIEFS FUNDAMENTALLY- ALL AGREE THAT ITIZENSHIP IN AN OF ITSELF SHOULD NOT BE A BARRIER TO SOMEBODY BECOMING A PEACE OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE ELEVEN MILLION IMMIGRANTS IN THE STATE MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE COME HERE AS CHILDREN MANY OF THEM HAS AS MR BADAR MENTIONED SERVED AND CADET PROGRAMS AND BEEN VERY WORTHY CANDIDATES ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER ON. THEY COULD NOT PURSUE THE CAREER THAT THEY WERE FOCUSED ON BECAUSE OF THE CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENT- AND THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF POLICE CHIEFS OF REYES THIS INTERNALLY WITH US AND INSIDE THE ASSOCIATION OF A YEARS ALTHOUGH THE COMPLEXITIES OF ALWAYS GOTTEN IN THE WAY. AND SO I WANT TO THANK SENATOR SKINNER FOR ACTUALLY FINALLY- BEING WILLING TO CHAMPION THIS WANT TO PUSH THE ISSUE. SO WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT CAN WE DO- ESPECIALLY THE TIME WHERE RECRUITMENT AT AN ALL TIME LOW. AND WE NEED A DIVERSE GROUP OF CANDIDATES THAT REPRESENT THEIR COMMUNITIES THIS IS SOMETHING WE ALL FALL TALKED ABOUT OVER THE YEARS. THIS BILL DEFINITELY. ASSIST IN THAT ENDEAVOR- AND LAST I WANT TO MENTION THAT NOTHING IN SB SIXTY ROADS. THE STANDARDS FOR ACADEMIC MORAL CHARACTER OR PHYSICAL ABILITY- THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. EVERYONE OF THESE CANDIDATES WOULD HAVE TO PASS THE SAME STRINGENT. REQUIREMENTS THAT EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO GO THROUGH ITS JUST THE CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENT THAT WOULDN'T GET IN THE WAY- AND CONCERNING BACKGROUND CHECKS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE DEFINITELY TALKED ABOUT- I THINK. YOU KNOW IF. AND THIS IS THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD WITH IT WITHIN THE ASSOCIATION IS THAT IF SOMEONE HAS. MAYBE ONLY TWO YEARS ON THE RECORD THAT THEY'VE BEEN HERE AND THAT'S ALL THE ONLY BACKGROUND THAT WE HAVE IN THE REST COMES FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET HIRED. BECAUSE THE AGENCY IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SATISFY THAT THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB ON THE BACKGROUND CHECK TO IDENTIFY. ANYTHING THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE- SO- YOU KNOW IF IT AS LONG AS THERE'S A BODY OF EVIDENCE ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL- THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE. AND THE CHEESE CAN MAKE A DECISION AT THAT TIME IF THEY'RE GONNA HIRE THEM NOTHING HERE SAYS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE HIGHER THIS IS JUST ABOUT ELIGIBILITY- SO. WE'RE PROUD TO BE IN SUPPORT TODAY AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE YOU KNOW IT'S AS THERE ARE GONNA BE SOME COMPLEXITIES THAT WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH. A BUT AGAIN THANK THE SENATOR FOR AUTHORING THIS MONTH. THANK YOU. THE MODERATOR WILL GO DOOR WELL ARE AMONG THE FIRST ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES HERE IN THE ROOM THAT.

WELL FIRST GO TO LINE SIXTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THAT MY WIFE CAN YOU HEAR ME- YES AGAIN AREA. OKAY THIS IS REALIZE FROM FLETCHER COUNTY AND I'M ACTUALLY IN OPPOSITION OTHER STOP. ALL RIGHT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WITNESSES SUPPORT THANK GOODNESS. BUT WILL NOW GO TO NUMBER SIXTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. WORK THANK YOU. AT THE TIME WE HAVE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE. GREAT NOW WILL GO TO WITNESSES OPPOSITION WE HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS WITNESS JULIO DE LEON. AND IF MR DALY OWNERS- HE'S HERE IN PERSON SO WILL ALLOW HIM TO SUGGEST MONEY AT THE START THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JULIA THE LEON. I'M SORRY WITH THE- MERCED COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND I OVER HAVE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT. PROFESSIONAL I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S MARIN AND ON BEHALF OF SHARES AT THE UNCLE- WE'RE HERE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION SB NINE SIXTY. ON TO SPECIFIC GROUNDS NUMBER ONE THERE'S AMPLE LEGAL PRECEDENT. TO SUPPORT OPPOSITION NUMBER TWO. THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES INVOLVED. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY DANGER CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SAFETY IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS AS WRITTEN- BEFORE BEGAN. AND I TO CLEAR STATE OUR POSITION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE FOR IMMIGRANTS OR MIGRANTS AND WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO- HIRING DACA RECIPIENTS WERE THOUSANDS OF HARD WORKING. MEN WOMEN TO COME TO THIS. A CITY CALIFORNIA WORK. THIS IS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. YOU SEE I KNOW THE STRUGGLES OF IMMIGRANTS BECAUSE I'M THE SON OF AN IMMIGRANT OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS MY PARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM A SELLER. IN THE MID NINETEEN SEVENTIES I KNOW THE STRUGGLES THAT IMMIGRANTS FACE FIRST HAND. HOWEVER THIS BILL ELIMINATES A CITIZENSHIP AND LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR PEACE OFFICERS HOWEVER. IT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY STATE. WHAT FORMER WORK PERMIT WOULD BE A SUBSTITUTE AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE HAVING SOME ISSUES WITH THIS BILL- SOME OF THE FIRST ROUND OPPOSITION. WHICH IS THE- MORAL CHARACTER WE'VE HEARD SOME TESTIMONY BEFORE ABOUT WHAT MORAL CHARACTER MEANS. HOWEVER IF SOMEONE APPLIES FOR LEGAL RESIDENT LEGAL RESIDENCY. OR WORK PERMITS. THE FEDERAL WORK PERMIT. R. OR CITIZENSHIP THAT PERSON THE SUBJECT TO A BACKGROUND CHECK FROM THE U. S. C. I. S. UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES- AMONG OTHER THINGS. THEY ARE TODAY THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE GOOD MERIT GOOD MORAL CHARACTER. AND LOYALTY IN PRINCIPLE SO YOU GUYS THIS CONSTITUTION HOWEVER. THEIR DEFINITION OF GOOD MORAL CHARACTER IS A LITTLE BIT OF NARROWLY TAILORED. AND MORE DEFINED TO NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DID NOT HAVE THAT ABILITY AND ACCESS TO FEDERAL RECORDS AND FEDERAL AGENCIES- AND FEDERAL DATABASES THAT THEY USED TO SCREEN. APPLICANTS FOR NATIONAL NATURALIZATION CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THAT OPTION- THEY HAVE FINGERPRINT FBI FAVOR CHECKS WHICH WE DO HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CONSULAR LOOKOUT AUTOMATED SUPPORT SYSTEMS. MISSTATES ACUTE ADVISORY OPINIONS. WILL HAVE ACCESS THE TESTIMONY DURING THE INTERVIEW. AND WE ALSO DON'T HAVE ANY- ABILITY TO. INVESTIGATE LEADS FROM OTHER U. S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS HAVE NO JURISDICTION OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WE CANNOT GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS AND ASK THEM FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CITIZENSHIP AND WHAT THEY DID. ARE TO COME TO NICE THINGS. THAT'S WHAT I SEE IS A IS A WITHOUT SPECIFICALLY STATING. IN THE BILL. THAT THE PERSON IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A FEDERAL WORK PERMIT. THAT SUBJECTS THAT PERSON TO THIS KIND OF SCRUTINY CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE. A WITHOUT THAT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR SOMEONE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY. ILLEGALLY THE NEXT DAY APPLY FOR PEACE OFFICER STATUS AND AT THAT POINT THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO WEAPONS OF THE PAST ACADEMY. THEY WOULD- HAVE ACCESS TO CRIMINAL INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. AND OTHER- TACTICS POLICE TACTICS. AND TURN AROUND AND USE IT AGAINST US WHAT ONE DAY. SECOND PROBLEM IS A LEGAL PRECEDENT THERE ARE TWO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CASES THAT HAVE BEEN- UP HELD SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT- DIRECTLY ON POINT THE FIRST IS FULLY VERSUS CALLING. FOR THIRTY FIVE US TWO NINETY ONE NINETEEN SEVENTY A CASE. NEW YORK STATE TROOPERS MOST LIKE CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE A STATUTE. THAT REQUIRES CITIZENSHIP. BUT WE ARE THAT STATUTE VIOLATED THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OR TO THE MOMENT OR DISAGREE. AND THE COURT- QUOTE THE COURT THE COURT SAID THAT THE POLICE FUNCTION IS ESSENTIALLY A DESCRIPTION OF ONE OF THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT POLICE TO FILM THE IN MOST FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATION OF GOVERNMENT TO HIS CONSTITUENCY THEY ARE CLOTHED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE AN ALMOST INFINITE VARIETY OF DISCRETIONARY POWERS. THE DECISION AFFECTS MEMBERS OF PUBLIC. SIGNIFICANTLY AND OFTEN THE MOST SENSITIVE AREAS OF DAILY LIFE AN ARREST IS A SERIOUS MATTER. FOR ANY PERSON EVEN WORK WERE NO PROSECUTION FALLS ONE OF CLOSE GRANTED SO CLEARLY THE EXERCISE POLICE AUTHORITY CALLS FOR A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT. AND DISCRETION. AND THE COURT SAID CITIZENS ARE PRESUMED TO BE MORE FAMILIAR WITH A SYMPATHETIC TO AMERICAN TRADITIONS THEREFORE STATE ME CONSONANT WITH THE CONSTITUTION CONFINE THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY TO CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE SECOND CASE CONNELLY SAME SAME A- THE SAME ANALYSIS THE COURT REALLY WAS IT WAS IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL FOR STATES TO RESTRICT THE SAUCERS- TO HAVE CITIZENSHIP. AND IT WAS A MENTION ABOUT ATTORNEYS AND FORTY ONE OTHER- POSSESS OUR PROFESSIONS THAT HAVE GOTTEN AWAY FROM CITIZENSHIP. PERSONAL STORY I AM ALSO AN ATTORNEY. I HAVE A PRIVATE PRACTICE ON THE SIDE. WHEN I'M ACTING AS AN ATTORNEY I AM NOT A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE I AM A PRIVATE PERSON. I REPRESENT PRIVATE CLIENTS. I DO IN IRAQ WITH THE COURT AND I DO INTERACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT BUT I'M NOT A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE BY CONTRAST EVERY PEACE OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA. IS A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE. IS HIRED BY A GOVERNMENT AGENCY SO THERE'S A CLEAR DISTINCTION. THAT THE COURT HAS ALWAYS DRAWN. AND THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HELD THESE TWO SUPREME COURT CASES. THIRTY SECTION. THAT YOU CONCLUDE YES SIR THE CLOSING OF THE BERRIES NOW WE CANNOT IN GOOD FAITH. SUPPORT THE BILL AND THIS WEEK WE ARE ASKING FOR NO VOTE UNLESS- CENTER SKINNER NAY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS CAN WORK TOGETHER TO AMEND THE BILL TO ADULTS SPECIFIC LANGUAGES. THAT WE ARE REQUEST THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN THE ROOM WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF US THREE NINE SIXTY. SHE NONE MODERATOR NOW GO TO THE PHONE LINE TO SEE IF THERE ARE WITNESSES WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF SB NINE SIXTY. IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR OPPOSITION. AND WE GIVE THREE IN OUR QUEUE AT THIS MOMENT- WILL FIRST GO TO NUMBER SIXTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I GET TIRED OF THE STREET WATCH AGAIN I AM IN STRONG OPPOSITION WITH WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THERE TO WITNESS. NOW GO TO NUMBER SIXTY NINE. NUMBER SIX YEAH GOOD. HELLO MOVED TO NUMBER FIFTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS ERICA HOW WILLIAMS AND MICHAEL COLE SB. NINE SIX ZERO THANKS THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. AT THE TIME WE HAVE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE ALL RIGHT I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND- I DON'T SHE LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. OF THE BILL OF CENTER SKINNER WHAT ARE WE GOING TO ADD ME ON- SO ARE. SO I YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE UP OPPOSITION WHAT SORT OF BIG PICTURE ON THIS BILL SO I HAVE- SINCE I'VE BEEN AN ELECTIVE OFFICE FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS NOW I'VE ATTENDED- ALMOST EVERY POLICE ACADEMY GRADUATION AT SAN FRANCISCO A POLICE DEPARTMENT IT'S GREAT TO GO AND SEE THESE NEW YOUNG DIVERSE CADETS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND PEOPLE ARE GOING PART OF OUR COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO- AND FOR A LONG TIME- THESE CLASSES ARE ALWAYS BUDGET AT IKE FIFTY FIVE. I COULD THAT'S IN ABOUT FORTY OR FORTY TO GRADUATE- A FEW WEEKS AGO I WENT TO THE MOST RECENT ONE OR THIRTEEN- GRADUATES I THOUGHT BECAUSE IT THE CITY BUDGETED FOR SMALLER CLASSES BECAUSE THERE'S A REAL SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO THESE DAYS ARE GOING TO GO INTO A POLICING AND SO ON THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE WHO ARE HAVE AUTHORIZATION. TO WORK- HERE AND BUT AND ARE. WHILE FIVE TWO PEOPLE ALL. AND ASSEMBLY BANDS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT. YET CITIZENS. I JUST THINK IT MAKES NO SENSE TO PROHIBIT THEM AND WE SHOULD GIVE. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE FLEXIBILITY. THE BILL DO THE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND IF THEY IF THEY'RE SLOPPY ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE IN ABOUT THE GREATEST LIABILITY OF EVERY INCENTIVE TO DO. STRONG BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE GONNA GO THROUGH ALL THE TRAINING THAT EVERYONE ELSE- GOES THROUGH. AND I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT ABILITY I ALSO DO WANT TO SAID THE- OPPOSITION THEN MAKE A REFERENCE TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE PEOPLE COULD GET TRAINING AND THEN USE IT AGAINST US. LET'S BE CLEAR PEOPLE GET TRAINING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE HOME YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT TRAINING AGAINST YOU KNOW. OUR OUR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA- AND- I DON'T THINK THAT. DENYING THEM YOU KNOW SOME OF SOMEONE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING BAD. TO SAY WELL WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE YOU POLICE ACADEMY TRAINING NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE LIKE OKAY I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING BAD PEOPLE GET TRAINING- AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS. AND I ALSO AND THIS IS A TRAGEDY. THAT ON JANUARY SIX THERE WERE SEVERAL DOZEN- CURRENT AND RETIRED POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE PART OF THAT INSURRECTION. SO THE IDEA THAT IF WE JUST LIMIT POLICE OFFICERS TO- CITIZENS. DIED THAT MEANS IT'S ALL GOING TO BE GOOD- YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT IF PEOPLE WANT TO DO SOMETHING BAD. SUCH AS TRY TO OVERTHROW THE US GOVERNMENT ON THEY CAN DO THAT EVEN IF THEY'RE CITIZENS AND UNFORTUNATELY A LARGE NUMBER OF CITIZENS DID- TRY TO VIOLENTLY OVERTHROW THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT- SO THIS IS A GOOD. BILL I SUPPORT A AND I MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR THE SKETCH AND DEBATE THIS IS. SKINNER TROUBLE. THANK YOU I'M IN THANK YOU SENATOR ASKING FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOURTH EIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THESE FIRST OF ALL IT'S BEEN AN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ME. LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO- AS JULIO AND I'M SORRY YOUR LAST NAME I'M REALLY ON THE LEON THAT'S RIGHT WITH A LOAN- MENTION ALSO A DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS- IN THIS COUNTRY. AND I THINK- I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT- MOVING FORWARD HERE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE SO I HAVE THE ABILITY TO LIVE IN MEXICO WITH MY GRANDPARENTS AND MY PARENTS AND THEN WITH YOUR BACK AND FORTH IN THE U. S. IN HERE SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN MEXICO. AND I AM A US CITIZEN AT SOME POINT OCCUR IS THE CITED THAT I WOULD JUST KEEP THE U. S. CITIZENSHIP- IN PLACE GRATEFUL I- I OFTEN SPEAK ABOUT THE- THE LOVE THAT I HAVE FOR THIS COUNTRY AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT IT IS OFFERED AS FLOW THROUGH EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND I'M A FERVENT ADVOCATE FOR LEGAL IMMIGRATION THE REASON BEING IS THAT I HATE I HATE. TO SEE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SHADOWS. IN THIS COUNTRY. BECAUSE IT LEAVES THEM VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION ON SO MANY FRONTS. AND SO THAT'S WHY I EAT AMID ADVOCATE FOR LEGAL IMMIGRATION IN A REFORM IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE TRULY OUTDATED AND TALK ABOUT OUTDATED- YOU KNOW. PROCESSES AND- THOUGHT I MEET OUR OUR- OUR IMMIGRATION PROCESS IS OUTDATED IN THE WEEK WE LEGALIZE WE INTEGRATE. ONE MILLION IMMIGRANTS A YEAR LEGALLY INTO THIS COUNTRY- THEY ARE AT LOT OF LOOPHOLES AND I A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH IMMIGRATION HAS AND MAKES A VERY LENGTHY AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY'RE LIVING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO. HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE HERE BUT- MY MAIN CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT WHEN WE HAVE UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY IT DOES LEAVE VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION AND I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT. FEDERAL- AND I THINK. I THINK THE ANGLE IN WHICH WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS MORE EFFICIENTLY WOULD BE IN OUR IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT ALLOWS THESE KIDS- AS YOU THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ANYONE A YOUNG ADULT AS WELL- WHO ARE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE ABLE TO BECOME CITIZENS AND THE REASON BEING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO- TO- HAVE THAT USE IT. THERE'S A REASON WHY WE THERE'S CERTAIN- SPACES THAT WE- WE REQUIRE PEOPLE TO BE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD U. S. ITIZENS AND SO FORTH. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE THAT OATH. TO BECOME A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY. YOU'RE SWEARING ALLEGIANCE TO THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT IT STANDS FOR AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT MANY OF OUR OUR YOUNG UNDOCUMENTED- YOUNG ADULTS DID NOT CHOOSE IT WOULD NOT DO THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IF THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT IF THEY IF THE IMMIGRATION PROCESS ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT AND DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE I'M I'M- YOU KNOW I. IT MAKES ME CONCERNED THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS HIM TO PURSUE THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK IF THEY HAD THE CHOICE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. THEY WOULD PROBABLY DO THAT. BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. SOMEONE CHOOSES TO REMAIN A CITIZEN OF A DIFFERENT COUNTRY THE CHOICE. NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BECOME CITIZENS THIS COUNTRY BUT I CHOICE TO BECOME A CITIZEN OF ANOTHER COUNTRY. PERSON BECOMING A U. S. CITIZEN. THEN IT MAKES ME QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THEY THEIR HEART- TO PROTECTING- IN- YEAH I WAS LEADING HERE JUST BECAUSE- DEMONSTRATE A KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE U. S. HISTORY IN GOVERNMENT AND DEMONSTRATE A LOYALTY. LOYALTY TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. ANDY WILLING TO TAKE THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE. TO THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS A CHOICE THAT THEY- THAT THEY MAKE WHEN THEY BECOME YOU ASSIST CITIZENS AND ONCE AGAIN I'M TALKING ABOUT- YOUNG ADULTS WHO CHOOSE TO IF THEY COULD BECAUSE THE IMMIGRATION POLICIES WOULD ALLOW THEM- I'M NOT SPEAKING TO THE TO THE TO THE FACT THAT MANY CAN'T OR HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BUT TO THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD. SO MY ANGLE AND MY CONCERN WOULD BE THAT. WE NEED TO REFORM OUR IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND THAT'S I KNOW THAT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE NOT A STATE ISSUE BUT WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT END TO ALLOW THESE- THESE CADETS TO BE ABLE TO WORK YOU KNOW WITH. THE CHOICE TO. BE LOYAL TO THE FRIENDS OF THE US CONSTITUTION BE WILLING TO TAKE THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE ON THAT END- BEFORE COMMITTING TO THAT BECAUSE I'M JUST KIND OF WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT. BY PLACING IN THIS POSITION IN MAKES THEM VULNERABLE. TO THE INFLUENCES OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT TO ME- IS SOMEONE WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS COUNTRY. AND IS SO GRATEFUL BUT ALSO APPRECIATE AND LOVE THE HERITAGE WHICH I AM. BEEN FACED WITH IN WHO WHO MAKES ME WHO I AM. I THINK AS A STATE WE START A REASON WHY SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD COME TO THIS COUNTRY IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAFETY AS WE HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT KEEP US SAFE WE'RE NOT PERFECT BECAUSE OF HUMAN BEINGS MAKING WRONG CHOICES OF COURSE WE'RE NOT PERFECT BUT WE HAVE IDEALS AND PRINCIPLES AND LAWS THE HELP OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS STAY SAFE. AND WHEN WE STARBRIGHT KEEN THOSE AND TRYING TO WORK AROUND THEN WE START. READING LOOPHOLES AND- THERE'S A WORD THAT I'M THINKING OF IN MY- THE MEETING BUT I THE WORD I'M I'M NOT QUITE COMING TO MY TO MY THE FRONT OF MY- I THINK HERE. BUT I'M AFRAID I'M AFRAID. THAT WE START MESSING WITH OUR WITH OUR PRINCIPLES AND CREATING LEGAL LOOPHOLES. THAT NOT FOR THE GOOD HEARTED INTENDED PERSON BUT THE LOOPHOLES THAT IT LEAVES US VULNERABLE TO. TO THOSE WITH- NEFARIOUS HEARTS. AND MINDS. TO THE VERY STATE AND COUNTRY THAT WE- THAT WE HAVE AT HAND AND SO- ON THAT END I CANNOT I. WOULD LOVE LOVE TO WORK AND SEE YOU KNOW IF ARE. ARE- OUR OUR- REPRESENTATIVES IN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WOULD TAKE ON THIS ISSUE AND HELP WITH IMMIGRATION POLICIES- WITH REFORM BUT IN THIS CASE AS FAR AS THE STATE GOES AND- AND NOT FOR THE GOOD HEARTED GOOD WILL- PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE BUT FOR THE NEFARIOUS ACTORS THAT WE MAY HAVE. COMING IN AND USING THAT AS A LOOPHOLE TO- TO WORK WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM NOT THAT QUICK CREATES A GREAT CONCERN I DON'T WANT OUR SYSTEM OF LAWS HAD TO BE- HI. GOSH WHAT IS THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR ANYBODY. I'M SORRY COMPROMISED I GUESS YOU COULD THE IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK OF RIGHT NOW IS COMPROMISED I THINK THERE'S- WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR POLICIES AND LAWS. THAT MAKE US WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. ANY OTHER ASIAN PERMISSION TO RESPOND YES PLEASE- PRECIADO CURE- SUPPRESSING THOSE BUT I WANTED TO CLARIFY THIS DOES NOT ALLOW THOSE WERE LIVING IN THE SHADOWS TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER. THIS BILL ONLY ALLOWS THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING LEGALLY AND HAVE THE LEGAL ABILITY TO WORK HERE. SO THROUGH VISA GREEN CARD THAT PERMANENT RESIDENCY BUT THERE'S A VARIETY OF FORMS THERE'S A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS THAT GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT LEGAL RIGHT TO WORK HERE. BUT NOT BUT IS NOT FULL CITIZENSHIP TRYING TO DO IT IS NOT OPENING THE PROFESSION TO ANYONE WHO HAPPENED TO COME HERE AND US AND GONE THROUGH ANY PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO LEGALLY WORK HERE. THE. TWENTY ANY ADDITIONAL COMES TO QUESTIONS FOR THE GARLIC'S. I WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER FOR THIS COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NEFARIOUS INDIVIDUALS WHO FAIL TO TAKE ALL OF OUR ADULT IF THAT'S JUST SCARES YOU THEN JANUARY SIX MUST'VE BEEN A PICNIC BECAUSE IT WAS SPOKE TO HAVE BEEN BORN HERE THEIR ENTIRE LIFE. AND YOU WE HAD A POLICE CHIEF FROM THE STATE WHO ACTIVELY USE THAT TRAINING TO TRY TO OVERTURN THIS GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT SO THE MERE FACT THAT SOMEONE WAS NOT BORN HERE OR SOMEONE HAS NOT TAKEN OVER DOES NOT DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF LOYALTY TO THIS COUNTRY OR TO LOOK LOYALTY TO. YOU KNOW THEY HAD THEIR FELLOW MAN AND LIKE A STATE JANUARY SIXTH HERE AT ME AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE FOLKS WERE BORN HERE AND NEVER TOOK CALLED BECAUSE THEY WERE BORN HERE IN IN AND OUT TO PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE AND MANY OF THEM MET THROUGH MILITARY AND POLICE SERVICE BUT THEY FELT QUITE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO YOU. KNOW TRY TO OVERTURN THE GOVERNMENT SO IF YOU HAVE YOUNG FOLKS HERE WHO- HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN BORN HERE BUT THEY DESIRE DESIRE TO PROTECT. AND SERVE INTO IT AN AUDIBLE WAY.% AND OUR OUR WILL TO THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. I THINK THEY SHOULD BE JUST AS WELCOME AS THOSEMANY INDIVIDUALS THAT AS WE SEE THAT WERE BORN HERE WHO. CHOOSE TO OVERTURN THIS GOVERNMENT AND FROM THE WORST TERRORIST ARE BORN RIGHT HERE ON THIS. IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY DAY SO. I APPRECIATE IT IF YOU THAT NOTE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- YES THANK YOU- I KNOW THAT WE WILL BE WORKING AS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH. TO ENSURE THAT ANY AGENCY CAN DO AN APPROPRIATE THROWBACK BACKGROUND CHECK AS- ARE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE- POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION SAID YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE SOME CLARIFICATIONS WE NEED BUT CERTAINLY. WE KNOW THAT OUR AGENCIES ARE NOT GOING TO JUST RUSH TO HIRE. PEOPLE THAT THEY- HAVE. IN IN THEIR ABILITY TO DO AN APPROPRIATE BACKGROUND CHECK. SO WHAT- WHAT THIS DOES IS JUST READ. REMOVE THE OBSTACLE. THAT YOU THAT YOUR THAT IF YOU'RE A PERSON. WHERE IS THE LEGAL ABILITY TO WORK HERE. THAT YOU HAD AND WE OBVIOUSLY WILL AS WE SAID AS IT MOVES THROUGH WORK OUT ANYTHING THAT WOULD- WOULD BE RESTRICTIVE FOR THE- THAT PERSON FROM BEING ABLE TO FUNCTION AS A SWORN OFFICER BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE INTENTION IS THAT THEY COULD FULLY FUNCTION. THAT AND WE WOULD BE ALIGNING OURSELVES WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES WHO DO NOT HAVE THE REQUIREMENT OF BEING A CITIZEN AS THE AS THE THING THAT ABILITY TO BE A SWORN OFFICER ANOTHER WORDS WE WOULD BE WE WOULD BE OPENING IT TO ALLOW FOR- PEOPLE HAVE THE LEGAL ABILITY TO WORK BUT OTHERWISE MEET ALL OTHER CRITERIA THAT WE EXPECT. FOR SWORN OFFICERS. AND YOUR CARD I ASKED RIVALS WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WIENER WE I WOULD DO PASSED BUT FIRST REFERRED TO APPROPRIATIONS. CANCEL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON SB NINE SIXTY. BRADFORD AYE BRADFORD I'D SHOW BOTH FOR ABOVE NO COM MARKER HI KAMLAGER AYE SKINNER SKINNER AYE WIENER. WIENER AYE VOTES FORTY ONE FORTY ONE THAT MEASURES OUT NEXT WE HAVE SENATORS WIENER WITH ELEVEN SB ELEVEN OH SIX. KAREN CENTER WHEN YOU'RE READY. BUT FOR THE RECORD THIS THING NEEDS TO BE RAISED. RIGHT NOW WITH MY LITTLE LIKE A LITTLE BABY DOLL. PRESENTATION. OKAY. SO WALKED INTO THE SAME SPACE I'M COLLEAGUES- THEY'RE PRESENTING SENATE BILL I'M ELEVEN OH SIX THE FRESH START ACT WHICH HELPS PEOPLE TO CLEAR THEIR CRIMINAL RECORDS BY ENSURING- THAT OUTSTANDING RESTITUTION RESTITUTION FINES ARE NOT A BARRIER TO EXPUNGEMENT AND A FRESH START I'M CURRENTLY- PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR EXPUNGEMENT OF THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD- ARE FREQUENTLY DENIED THAT EXPLAINS GRANT- BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE ON P. R. RESTITUTION. THE RESTITUTION THAT IS- THEN THE ONLY THING HOLDING THEM BACK FROM CLEARING THE RECORD AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE STABLE HOUSING AND A JOB CETERA- WE KNOW THAT WHEN COURTS THAT RESTITUTION IT'S NOT BASED ON ABILITY. TO PAY SO SOMEONE WHO IS. THERE POOR COULD A REST THOUSANDS OR EVEN MORE AND SO THE PERSON HAS BEEN RELEASED- FROM PRISON- AND THERE IS REALLY NO WAY FOR THEM TO PAY- THAT RESTITUTION- AND- THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO CLEAR THE RESTITUTION- AND SO THEY'RE THAN STOCK WITHOUT THAT. AND TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CLEAR THAT RESTITUTION REDUCE WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY. THAT IS A SEPARATE CONVERSATION WE KNOW THAT THE RESTITUTION SYSTEM IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE VICTIMS ALMOST NEVER GOT. EITHER ANY RESTITUTION REALLY ONLY GOT A SMALL PERCENTAGE THE SYSTEM IS NOT HELPING. VICTIMS BUT PARTICULAR IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE THEN I EXPUNGE RENT WITH AN AYE RECORD CLEARING TO PEOPLE. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY OWE RESTITUTION FOR MAKING IT EVEN HARDER FOR THEM EVER TO PAY ANY PIECE. OF THAT RESTITUTION. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY IT AGAIN THIS BILL DOES NT REDUCE WHAT PEOPLE- IT DOESN'T GET RID OF RESTITUTION THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES- COUNTRY SOME OF THE CONFUSION THE SOME PEOPLE HAD ABOUT THE BILL. ALL IT DOES IS SAY THAT A JUDGE CANNOT RELY EXCLUSIVELY. ON UNPAID RESTITUTION TO THE LIVE RECORD CLEARING IF SOMEONE IS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE- JUDGE CANCER WHERE YOU OWE RESTITUTION YOU CANNOT HAVE YOUR RECORD PLAYER THIS BILL WILL ALLOW A PERSON TO GET THE RECORD CLEARED. IT WOULD STILL OF THE RESTITUTION BUT THEY COULD AT LEAST HAVE A CHANCE TO GET THEIR LIFE BACK TOGETHER AND START MOVING FORWARD ALSO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. ARE WITH ME TODAY BY PHONE TO TESTIFY ARE ARE REAL LATER AND SEE IF IT WAS A PUBLIC DEFENDER- FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY- AND THEN THE BELL BAYLOR THE DEPUTY. DIRECTOR OF FREEDOM FOR YOU. WELL A LAWYER WITH IS TO MINUTES EACH A TOTAL MEMBERS TO FOR THEIR TESTIMONIES MISTER. LEONARD J. OF YOUR READY MAY BEGIN. HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND I THINK THE ELEVEN OH SIX TODAY MY NAME IS ARIELLE LATE FEES AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE CLEAN SLATE PROGRAM AT ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. AS PART OF THE HOLISTIC MODEL IN OUR OFFICE THE DRAFT COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM ARE PROGRAM REPRESENTS PEOPLE SEEKING CRIMINAL RECORD. SB ELEVEN OF BIG WILL ALLOW MORE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA TO CLEAN THEIR CRIMINAL RECORDS AND THEREFORE THE LEAD TO GREATER EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. HELLO RECORD RELEASE PUTS PEOPLE IN A BETTER POSITION TO SECURE EMPLOYMENT AND CERTAIN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSES AND MAINTAIN STABLE EMPLOYMENT. HOWEVER IMPACT OUT DEMOCRATS DID OFTEN USED AS A REASON TO DENY THIS RELIEF EVEN ARE COMMON WITH OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO THAT. AND- I FEEL LET ME KNOW THANKS MISSILE AND REDUCTION OF CONVICTION NOT BE DENIED SOLELY BECAUSE OF OUTSTANDING RESTITUTION OR RESTITUTION FINES. AND RESTITUTION WILL NOT BE A FACTOR IN DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY. THE NINE ONE RECORD RELEASED ACTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND THE ONE POINT. THE FEDERAL DO NOT REMOVE AN OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY OUTSTANDING VICTIM RESTITUTION BUT THEY DO PUT SOMEONE IN A BETTER POSITION TO SECURE EMPLOYMENT. APPLE AFTER WORKING WITH OUR PROGRAM TO GET CRIMINAL RECORD VANITY ONE CLIENT WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FROM A TEMP JOB TO A FULL TIME PERMANENT POSITION. I CAME WITH THE PAY AND- BENEFITS INCLUDING MEDICAL AND DENTAL COVERAGE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE MORE PEOPLE ACCESS TO CLEAN PLATE RELIEF LEADING TO A BETTER CHANCE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY BILLETE ABOUT THE LINE. WHICH WILL BENEFIT BOTH INDIVIDUALS WITH HEART CONDITIONS.

GREAT WILL BRING I BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO S. B. ELEVEN OH SIX. SKINNER CALMER. I'LL JUST MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IT'S BEEN MOVED. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS MEASURE MEASURE. HEARING TINA AND WINDOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I'VE VOEPEL YEAH I JUST WANT CLARIFICATION SO. WITH THE EXPUNGEMENT PART OF IT. I MISS. BEAR WITH ME UNDERSTANDING THAT THIRTEEN DOWN SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GAIN EMPLOYMENT. IS THAT WITH DO YOU HAVE THE INTENT TO DO THAT IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME. WHAT WHAT'S WHAT WHEN IT SO RIGHT NOW- WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A RECORD THAT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARED THEY CAN GET THE BARITONE PLACEMENT IN VARIOUS WAYS FIRST OF ALL WE KNOW THERE'S A LAUNDRY LIST OF TYPES OF PROFESSIONS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE FELONY CONVICTION YOU ARE SIMPLY YOU CAN'T GET A LICENSE I THINK MAYBE EVEN LIKE AS A BARBER OR THERE'S ALL SORTS OF IT'S HORRIBLE IT'S A SEPARATE THING WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM HEAD OF. SHOULD NOT BE PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO WORK SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CLEAR RECORD THERE'S A WHOLE LAUNDRY LIST OF JOBS THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY PROHIBITED. IN ADDITION. THERE ARE JUST TIMES WHEN EMPLOYER WHAT HIRE YOU AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE YOU KNOW EVEN IF THERE IS BAN THE BOX. LEGISLATION RATHER CANCER SCREENING ABOUT THE BEGINNING THEY CAN STILL SCREEN YOU OUT AT THE END OF THE PROCESS. SO WE KNOW THEM SOMEONE HAS AN UNCLEAR RECORD IT IS HARDER TO FIND WORK. FOR THE WORK THAT YOU FIND IS GOING TO BE LOWER PAID. OUR WORK IT'S ALSO HARD TO FIND HOUSING. AND SO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IF WE WANT THAT AGAIN WE CAN PUT ASIDE A SEPARATE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE CURRENT RESTITUTION. SYSTEM IS EVEN SERVING VICTIMS IT'S REALLY NOT IT'S A FAILED. DISASTER OF A SYSTEM THAT. HURTS EVERYONE- BUT IF WE IF WE ARE IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO REPAY TO MAKE RESTITUTION PAYMENTS. WHICH TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET A JOB HAVE HOUSING STABILITY IN THEIR LIVES. AND FOR TELLING PEOPLE KNOW YOU YOU'RE GONNA KEEP YOUR RECORD IT'S GOING TO BE A SCARLET LETTER ON YOUR- BACK FOREVER BECAUSE YOU POOR AND CAN'T PAY RESTITUTION. THE CRITICS OF THIS BOTH OF THEM IS NOT GOING TO GO A- PERSONS. WORK OR VERY MUCH MAYBE HOMELESS AND IT'S JUST IT SERVES NO VALID PURPOSE AND THAT'S WHY. AND THAT'S WHY HONESTLY THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS THAT THERE'S SUCH A LIMITED OPPOSITION THIS BILL AND IN FACT ONE. FOR A WHILE IN OPPOSITION LETTER AND THEN WE SPOKE TO THEM AND WE REALLY FLUSH OUT BUT I'M WHAT THE BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO. IT WITH YOUR THEIR OPPOSITION. THIS IS A PRETTY COMMON- BUILT. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR SO IS THIS ANY MEDIAN EXPUNGEMENT OF THEIR RECORDS ONE SIR ALF- IRWIN OUT OF YOUR TIME WE'RE NOT EXPUNGING ANYTHING BECAUSE THIS IS WHEN SOMEONE GOES TO THE COURT ASKING FOR EXPUNGEMENT. BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE FROM ANALYSIS THERE ARE CERTAIN- YOU KNOW THAT WERE THERE CERTAIN SITUATION FOR THE COURTS REQUIRED THROUGH GRAPHICS FUN GRANT OR THEIR AUTHORIZED ON THAT THE COURT CANNOT RELY SOLELY ON UNPAID RESTITUTION. TO TO DRIVE EXPANSION SO THAT WOULD HAPPEN WHATEVER THE PERSON GOES TO COURT- TO- TERRY SPONGE I'M GONNA MAKE SURE I'M NOT THE STATE ENOUGH YES THERE'S ALREADY TIME. WHEN YOU CAN GO TO GET EXPUNGED OR TO GET IT RESENTENCED FIVE FELONY TO A MISDEMEANOR VARIOUS THINGS SO THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THOSE TIME FRAMES. AND THEY'RE NOT A MEDIA YOU HAVE TO SHOW SOME PERIOD OF TIME WHICH YOU ARE THEY'VE MADE WE'VE MADE CHANGES OVER THE EXISTING HERE SO I DON'T HAVE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THE TIME FRAMES BUT THERE'S A TIME FRAME WHERE YOU HAD TO. BE BEHAVING IN A WAY THAT YOU'RE NOT COMMITTING MORE CRIMES SO IT WOULD BE. IF YOU WERE WHENEVER PEOPLE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE TO GO TO WORK- TO TRY TO GET AN EXPUNGEMENT. THEY COULD DO IT HERE AT ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT. THE COURT CAN SAY I'M DENYING IT BECAUSE YOU'RE ON PAID RESTITUTION. THERE WERE NOT CHALLENGES TIME LINES ARE AUTOMATICALLY GRANTING EVERYTHING. OKAY IS THERE IT DOES THIS PROVIDE. SO CANNABIS WITH THIS PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO PAY THE RESTITUTION IN ORDER TO GET. AND QUALIFY FOR THE SPANISH WITH DO YOU THINK THAT THIS WOULD AYE REMOVING THAT THE ABILITY TO DO THAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE TO CENTER BY SOMEONE AS YOU WORK TOWARDS THAT BECAUSE WHAT WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE WITH THE OTHER CARE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. I DON'T THINK SO I MEAN YOU HEARD A REAL PURPLE CASE ON THE PHONE TODAY SOMEONE WHO HAS LIKE BETWEEN EXIT NICK I THINK A HUNDRED THOUSAND EXPLAINS RUN. AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND RESTITUTION PLUS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER FEES AND SHE SAID SHE NEVER THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE WITH HER FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE- AND SO YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO TO BE IMPOVERISHED. THAN OTHER PEOPLE FOR REASONS YET ON THAT ONE TO BE HOMELESS. AND SO THEY'RE NOT MAKING THESE OVERWHELMINGLY PICKED IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS. THE PERCENTAGE OF VICTIMS RECEIVE EITHER ZERO. IN RESTITUTION OR A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE RESTORATION IS- THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. OFVICTIMS RECEIVE NOTHING OR VERY SMALL. PERCENTAGE EVEN WITH THIS. YOU KNOW ACCEPT SUCH A PENALTY HANG OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS THAT YOU CAN GET EXPUNGEMENT. AND SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID OVERWHELMINGLY SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS CHRIS ANY KIND OF INCENTIVE NOT TO PAY. THAT IT'S ALL INCENTIVE NOT TO PAY IT'S A REALITY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE POOR AND WORKING WE'RE HOPING TO KEEP THEM POOR BY SAYING. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CLEAR YOUR RECORD SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD JOB. YOU MAY NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO GET HOUSING. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FOR OTHERS WITH DISCLOSURE. ARE WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR CALM WATER AND WHEN WE TALKED CALLS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU WE HAVE EIGHTY TO SIMPLE DO PASSED CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL HONEST FEEL OF NO SIX OF ELEVEN OF SIXTY PASSED BRADFORD BRADFORD I'D CHOI BOGUE LONGER I COMMA- I'D SKINNER WIENER AYE WIENER AYE THREE TWO ONE THREE ONE WILL LEAVE THE MEASURE OPEN- NEXT UP IS S. B. THIRTEEN OH FOUR BY SENATOR CALM WATER. THEY'RE COMING HERE WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON I AM. THIS IS ALSO VERY LOW. I AM HERE TO PRESENT MY DEALS YOU KNOW SB THIRTEEN OH FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE CDC ARE GIVES TO PEOPLE UPON RELEASE FROM STATE PRISONS. ALSO KNOWN AS GATE MONEY. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO COMPEL CDC ARE TO CONTINUE ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION FROM TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ON WORK. THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF GATE MONEY GIVEN IS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AN AMOUNT THAT HAS REMAINED ON ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. USING THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY'S LIVING WAGE CALCULATOR S. B. THIRTEEN OH FOUR WILL INCREASE THIS AMOUNT. TO TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE THE TYPICAL MONTHLY EXPENSES FOR CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE PRE TAX. FOR A SINGLE ADULT WITH NO CHILDREN. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT REVISITED THIS NUMBER IN NEARLY FIFTY YEARS DESPITE INFLATION AND SOARING HOUSING PRICES. AND IS SOARING COST OF LIVING HOUSING PRICES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AND AT THE TIME A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECK COULD MORE THAN COVER A MONTH'S RENT ON A TYPICAL TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT. IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS BARELY COVERS ANY BASIC NEEDS FOR RELEASED PERSONS. OR PERSONS WHO ARE NOT INCARCERATED AND WOULD COVER LESS THAN 15% OF ONE MONTH'S RENT ON A TYPICAL STUDIO APARTMENT LET ALONE FOOD AND HYGIENE. PROVIDING A NEWLY RELEASED PERSON WITH ONE MONTH OF EXPENSES ALLOWS THEM TO LOCATE A NEW JOB AND MAY ASSIST WITH SOME OF THE MOST OF THE POST RELEASE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. MANY FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE FACE SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM FOR ROLE CHECK INS. PROVIDING GATE MONEY THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE REFLECTION OF TYPICAL EXPENSES FOR CALIFORNIANS IS CRITICAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF THIS POLICY. AND THE SUCCESS OF A REHABILITATIVE PRISON SYSTEM FACILITATING A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO LIFE AFTER PRISON BUT ULTIMATELY INCREASING PUBLIC SAFETY AND DECREASING RECIDIVISM.

THIS MEASURE BEFORE I AM I AM GOING TO I AM JUST LOOKING AS YOU LOOK VERY SERIOUSLY. MIGHT ANY COMMENTS THEY PROBABLY- SO THAT ARE COME LONGER I. SO I KNOW IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I'VE OFTEN- THOUGHT ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHEN OUR- SOME PEOPLE ARE SERVER TIME THEY FINISH OFF YOU KNOW THAT. JUST THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE IN YOU KNOW THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES AFTER BEING COURSE RATED SOME FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND- SOME OF THEM WHO DO NOT HAVE. ANY FAMILY SUPPORT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT CAN IT CAN REALLY HELP ON GET BACK IN I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE BEST HELP OUR- OUR INDIVIDUALS ARE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE LEAVING THE SYSTEM IN ABOUT THAT'S WHY I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR EDUCATION WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED SO THEY CAN HAVE A SKILL SET- THE KNOWLEDGE BASE TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW HAVE OFFERED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES ONCE THEY LEAVE- THAT'S- IN SUPPORT. OF AB THEM PREPARE TO MOVIE INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO WORK WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED TO SAVE MONEY SO THAT THEY- COME OUT WITH SOMETHING IN THEIR POCKET. M. SO I EAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR YOUR YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I EIGHT I DO WANNA DRESS THE CONCERNS I THINK. EVERY TAXPAYER. IN EVERY PERSON YOU KNOW. OUR SENIORS AND DISABILITY WITHOUT. A FIXED INCOME AND EVERY OTHER INDIVIDUAL THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THIS IT WILL LOOK AT THIS AND THINK. WOW I JUST HAVE TO SERVE TIME AND GET YOU KNOW SOME MONEY AND- NOT BE ABUSED YOU KNOW BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE HIS BE INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO SAY HEY I I'M- I'M BROKE. BUT IF I SERVE SOMETIME I'LL GET SITE AND HOW OFTEN CAN I DO THIS AND- I KNOW THAT SOUNDS REALLY REALLY. YOU KNOW FAR FETCHED BUT FOR BUT FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS AND I DO SPEAK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. ON THAT LOT. I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO'D BE VERY VERY CONCERNED. THAT- BUT THIS WOULD BE ABUSED BUT I DO. UNDERSTAND AND I'VE HEARD OF THAT. THE DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES AFTER SERVING TIME AND BECAUSE OF THAT. AND I THINK WE DO NEED A LITTLE BIT OF GRACE AFTER SERVING THEIR TIME AND HELP. IN GETTING BACK SO WITH THAT IN MIND WHICH LET YOU KNOW THAT I DO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. GREAT ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HEARING THREE. NO IT HASN'T. THE HOME OF THE BILL THANK YOU CENTERS SKINNER THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTERS SKINNER. WE HAVE A TO PASS YOU REFERRED TO APPROACH. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL OUT SB THIRTEEN OH FOUR. ONCE I'M SORRY I'M SORRY SIR I'M SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW TRUTHFULLY IT'S- SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO COME UP PEOPLE SAY NO WHY SHOULD WE BE GIVING FOLKS WHO- HAVE SERVED TIME IN PRISON. TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY. AND THE REALITY IS IT'S- EXPIRES WE SUBSIDIZE ALL KINDS OF FOLKS- AND SOMETIMES WE DO IT SOMETIMES WE DO IT OVER THE COURSE OF YOU KNOW MANY MANY YEARS THIS IS A ONE TIME LUMP SUM- IT'S- IMPOSSIBLE. FOR ANYONE TO BELIEVE. THAT YOU COULD COME OUT OF PRISON. WITH ONLY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND GET BACK ON YOUR FEET. AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU WOULD HAVE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ITS ENTIRETY. IF YOU HAD CLOSE THAT SOMEONE BROUGHT YOU WHEN YOU GOT RELEASED IF YOU HAD SOMEONE PICK YOU UP AND GIVE YOU A RIDE IF YOU HAD SOMEONE WHO IS BUYING YOUR FOOD WHEN YOU GOT OUT IF YOU HAD SOMEONE WHO MADE SURE THAT WHEN YOU LEFT YOU HAD ZERO DOLLARS ON THE BOOKS. IF YOU HAD SOMEONE WHO MADE SURE THAT YOU HAD A REPLACEMENT FOR ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT ID'S THAT YOU EITHER LOST OR THAT EXPIRED- WHILE YOU WERE SERVING TIME. IN ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE EXPENSES THAT COME OUT OF. TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS COULD COST SOMEONE AS MUCH AS SIXTY DOLLARS. IF SOMEONE GOT OUT AND HAPPEN TO HAVE KIDS OR- A FAMILY MEMBER OR SOMEONE WHO IS PROVIDING FOR THEM WHILE THEY WERE INSIDE. AND THEY JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU WITH A LUNCH OR DINNER. THAT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. COULD EVAPORATE. AND IF THEY ARE REQUIRED TO GET TRANSPORTATION TO VISIT THEIR PO. IF THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES- TO APPLY FOR PARTICULAR JOBS OR TO GO ON JOB INTERVIEWS OR TO EVEN GET SOME TRAINING. THEY CERTAINLY CAN'T GO NAKED. THEY HAVE TO HAVE CLOSE- AND SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE EXPENSES. THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. AND THEN I THINK MANY FOLKS THINK WELL YOU SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO THAT I GAVE YOU YOUR FREEDOM. WELL WE DIDN'T GIVE YOU YOUR FREEDOM YOU REHABILITATED OR YOUR SERVE YOUR TIME AND THEN THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE DO- THIS. IS ABOUT. ACKNOWLEDGING THE FACT THAT THE COST OF LIVING IS SO INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. AND IF WE DON'T WANT FOLKS. TO USE. MONEY TO USE. IF WE DON'T WANT FOLKS TO LEAN BACK INTO BEHAVIOR THAT GOT THEM WHERE THEY WERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. IF WE WANT TO BELIEVE THAT- HEY YOU CAN STILL BE POOR AND MAKE IT. THEN I GUESS WE SHOULD BE OKAY WITH THE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT THIS IS REALLY A KNOWLEDGE SHARING. THAT IF YOU WANT TO GIVE SOMEONE A LEG UP NOT FOR EVER. BUT FOR ONE MONTH TO LIKE GET IT TOGETHER THIS IS PROBABLY WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST. YOU KNOW I WAS TALKING WITH THE WITNESSES. BEFORE HAND AND- JOSEPH SAID SO MANY MANY TALK TO SAID. WHEN I GET OUT I JUST NEED TO DO X. Y. OR Z. SO THAT I CAN BUY A CAR. LIKE WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TO GET A RIDE. AND I WAS SAYING YES SO THAT YOU COULD DRIVE AND GO TO YOUR JOB INTERVIEW OR GET FOOD OR LOOK FOR- YOU KNOW. HE SAID NO BECAUSE YOU CAN LIVE IN THE CAR YOU CAN LIVE IN THE CAR UNTIL YOU CAN GET ON YOUR FEET TO GET A JOB. IT IS SAFE HOUSING FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. AND THE NUMBER ONE PRISONS ARE WOMEN IN THE MAJORITY OF THE WOMEN HAVE KIDS. AND SO WAS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WE ARE SAYING TO THESE MOTHERS. GO BACK AND DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING BEFORE YOU GOT HERE. WITH THIS ADDED STRESS OF NOT DOING THAT SO THAT YOU'RE NOT SEPARATED FROM YOUR KIDS AGAIN. AND I THINK THAT WE'RE OFFERING PEOPLE FAUSTIAN CHOICES. AND THIS IS A ONE TIME INFUSION TO SAY. I BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION I WANT YOU TO NOT COME BACK TO PRISON I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE MONTH'S HELP TO GET YOURSELF TOGETHER THAT IS REALLY ALL THIS IS THANK. AND SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE THOSE COMMENTS ARE EXACTLY WHAT OTHER FOLKS SAY AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HEAR THEM SO THAT I CAN SHARE THESE EXPERIENCES. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR SCANNER WE HAVE A MOTION TO PASS.

A DRASTICALLY CHANGED- ADDITIONALLY- WE FEEL THAT- THERE'S BEEN NO BASIS FOR THE CHARGE OF NINETEEN DOLLARS OR FOURTEEN DOLLARS- AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE TRUSTEE WAS- WAS ENUMERATED INFATUATED WITH LIMITED TO FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND IT WAS GREAT UP TO NINETEEN DEREGULATION. AND HOW HOW THIS IS ACTUALLY A WORK YOU CAN BE FOURTEEN DOLLARS IS GONNA BE NINETEEN DOLLARS. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THIS IS A P.
