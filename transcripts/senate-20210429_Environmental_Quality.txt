ON TODAY SENATE BILL SIX SIX TWO ALLOWS FOR INVESTOR OWNED GAS UTILITIES TO INVEST. IN THE DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE HYDROGEN TRANSPORTATION FUEL. IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION ONLY. IF THOSE PROJECTS DID NOT RESULT IN COST SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER RATES. FOR RESULT IN A NET INCREASE OF ENERGY SECTOR EMISSIONS. IN ADDITION AS MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR I HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. AS REFERRED IN AND THE UPDATED ANALYSIS ON PAGE SEVEN. THESE AMENDMENTS ADD AN ADDITIONAL BY METAL. GUARDRAIL AND ENSURE THAT THE HYGIENE GOING INTO THESE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. MEET OR EXCEED THE STATE'S CURRENT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION STANDARDS. BY ALLOWING THE GAS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO BEGIN TO INVEST. IN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN BEGIN TO ELECTRIFY SECTORS. THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN HARD TO ELECTRIFY FOR EXAMPLE THE BUSES. THE TRUCKS THE FLEET SUPPORT SHIPS. AND AVIATION AND OTHER HEAVY DUTY SECTORS HAS JUST NAME A FEW. SOME CONCERNS WERE BROUGHT ON MONDAY AND I WOULD LIKE TO. BRIEFLY ACT ADDRESS THOSE. AS MEANT ON PAGE. OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TWO WEEKS AGO. IN THE SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE I ACCEPTED VERY AND- AMENDMENTS. ONE APPROVAL WAS ADDED THAT MANDATE. THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. COULD NOT APPROVE A PROJECT THAT WOULD RESULT IN COST SHIFT IN CUSTOMER RATES. THIS NEW PROVISION ENSURES THAT. ONLY TO PUT RATEPAYERS WHOSE RAGE WOULD BE AFFECTED. ARE THOSE WHO WOULD. DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE PROJECT. ANOTHER ADDITIONAL PROVISION. WAS ADDED THAT MANDATED THE CAL PUBLIC YOU COMMISSION COULD APPROVE ANY PROJECTS THAT COVERS IN INCOME IN A- TO ENERGY SECTOR. AND FINALLY AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING TODAY.

IN THE TIMING AT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE AS WE CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION TODAY WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO BUDGET FOR THE- SO YOU COULD. AND DO YOUR BUSINESS- BUT- BOB ON MONDAY WE TALK QUITE A BIT ABOUT HOW HIGH ENERGY CAN BE A PART OF THE CAR CAL IS A NO WORDS ARE DO THE WORK ON THAT NUMBER OF A BILLS OUR COLLEAGUE. CENTER SKINNER- WE ALL TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS BILL COULD CREE A ROLE FOR COMPANY HELPING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I'M FROM THE DISCUSSION ON MONDAY AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE A FEW THINGS BECAME CLEAR I WOULD LIKE TO PUSH THE MARKET CALIFORNIA HOPEFULLY THE WHOLE COUNTRY TOWARD THE CLEANEST. AND LOWEST EMISSION SOURCES OF HYDROGEN WHEREVER WE CAN. AND YET OF COURSE OF. EXACTLY WHAT THOSE CLEAN AND BEST SOURCES. ARE IS STILL OVER THE CONTENTIOUS TOPIC AND WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROJECTS ARE BEING FUNDED WITH INAPPROPRIATE RATEPAYER DOLLARS. THOUGH THAT YOU KNOW. WE DID SOME FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REALLY WAS ADDRESSING THE SENATE. ENERGY COMMITTEE AS BELIEVES WITH REGARDS TO RESIDENTIAL- SO WE A REAL DISCUSS AROUND THE BILL. I BELIEVE IN MY POINT- IN HOUSE HAS BEEN- UPDATED TO A THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OF THE AUTHORS AGREED TO. IN THE NEXT MEMBER AYE I KNOW THAT ARE THAT YOUR STAFF OF ADD THIS IN. SHOULD WITH YOU. WE'RE ADDING MORE. TO POSSIBLE REGRETTABLE. IN THESE PARTS. ARE LIKE TRANSPORTING HYDROGEN THE DOESN'T MEET OUR CURRENT CURRENT RENEWABLE AT EMISSION STANDARDS. ARE WE KNOW THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK DILIGENTLY ON THIS BILL GOING FORWARD- ON ON BOTH THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY CONCERNS AND ALSO ON AFFORDABILITY REPAIR CONCERNS- WE CERTAINLY AFTER DEEP DIVE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. PUT IN BUT I WE ARE ALREADY ENGAGING IN CONVERSATION THIS MORNING AND OBVIOUSLY THE OTHER MAY WANT TO GO FURTHER- WITH REGARDS TO. SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES WITH REGARD TO THE BILL- IF IT MOVES FORWARD TODAY AND SO. AND ANYWAY WE- NOT SURE. GUY I'VE COME TO SUPPORTING THE BILL AFTER THE WORK DAY WE'VE- DONE- I'M THEY WERE GONNA DO YOUR OF THE AUTHOR TO- TO TWO INCH THAT WE'RE ALIGNING OUR STATE HYDROGEN PLAN WILL OUR OVERALL CLINICAL AND THAT'S. THAT'S CERTAINLY OUR COMMITTEES BY COURT. OF. WITH OVER TO THE COMMITTEE GOT UNDERSTOOD- THANK CHAIRED YOU- I WANTED TO JUST CLARIFY QUICK IT DOES NOT IMPACT RESIDENTIAL BUT IT DOES IMPACT COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL- THE RATE PAYERS IS THAT MY UNDERSTANDING I JUST BILL'S BEEN SOMEWHAT CONFUSING FOR ME TO FIGURE OUT- IF IT'S ONLY APPLIES TO THE DEVELOPERS AND THEY THEM AND THEIR FEES OR IF IT DID IF IT APPLIES TO. THE COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL WHICH HAPPENED UNDER THE ORIGINAL THE- WHEN WE HAD THE BROWNOUTS DURING THE GRAY DAVIS ARE THEY THEY LEFT RESIDENTS ALONE BUT THEY UP THE AMOUNT TO PAY OFF THE DEBT. ON COMMERCIAL RESIDENTIAL IS THIS BILL. NOT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO. PUT RATES HIGHER FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL THIS IS LITERALLY THE NEGOTIATION IS HAVING TO THE AUTHOR AND THE PUBLIC AGAIN SO I'M KIND OF CONFUSED ON EXACTLY STUDIES OF A FIFTH SENATE PLEASE SEND. PLEASE RESPOND THANK YOU CENTER- I'M I'D LIKE TO WORK AGAIN POINT OUT THANK YOU FOR THE CHAIR NUMBER ONE. FOR FOUR PARTICIPATING WITH ME AND THE REST THE COMMITTEE COULD MAKE THIS THING. VIABLE AND GO FORWARD THE DANCE YOUR QUESTION SENATOR- AND I'VE GOT TO GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION ASSUMING YOU KNOW THE INVESTMENT IS MADE THE PIPES ARE LAID IN THE HYDROGEN COMING THROUGH. WELL YOU GOT TO SAY A SHELL STATION ARE YOU HAVE A CHEVRON STATION WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S GOING TO PUT. THE PUMP THERE WELL THEN YOU'VE CREATED THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THE PROPRIETOR OF THAT STATION ALONG WITH UTILITIES OVER JOINT VENTURE. IN THE COST AND SO ON OBVIOUSLY BUT IF YOU AND I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THEN WE WILL BE PAYING AT THE PUMP. SO THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT NOW LET'S TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL THEN WE'VE GOT BECAUSE THE FUTURE IS TO GET THESE TRUCKS AND BUSES AND- AND DIESELS AND EVERYTHING. TO START THINKING ABOUT HYDROGEN SO WE HAVE THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH HYPOTHETICALLY WELL IF THEY WANTED TO HAVE THEIR PRIDE XIN THEN YES HAT COMMERCIAL ENTITY WOULD LIKE THE PROPRIETOR WE TALK ABOUT WITH JOINT VENTURE. TO PUT THOSE IN SO THEY CAN CONSIDER A SUPPLY OF THE MULTITUDE OF TRUCKS AND SO ON. NOT NO NORMAL COMMERCIAL NO RESIDENTIAL OR ANY WILL BE INVOLVED ONLY THE RATE PAYER. OR WHICH IS THE USER IN THIS. CASE WILL BE THE ONE INVOLVED. I FELT VERY. THE MILTON OUR UNDER THAT A SHIP THERE IS ANY SHIP ANYONE WHO'S NOT BENEFITING RESIDENTIAL WORK BUT BY IF WE NEED TO GET THIS THAT WE MEAN TO BRING- ENVIRONMENT THE ON ENERGY COMMITTEE BACK IN- COME ALONG THE LINES OF IT ARE YOU JUST DESCRIBE YOUR RIGHT YOU CAN REMEMBER WHAT WE IF YOU IF YOU'RE NOT USING THEN YOU'RE NOT BENEFITING IF USING YOUR BENEFITING AND IF YOU'RE BENEFITING YOUR PAIN. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. BOB THIS IS GONNA PROBES AND- BUT I THINK I THINK. I WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME AND THE PARTICIPATION OF REPUBLICAN STAFF IN THAT CONVERSATION W. AS WE- TRY TO LOCK DOWN A LANGUAGE. BURKE BUT I'M SORRY CENTER DOLLARS. IT'S I'M LOOKING AT THE OPPOSITION AND THAT'S THROUGH THE ROOM THE IT WOULD ON I'VE TALKED OPPOSITION THAT'S THE CONCERN YEP THE ONLY CONCERN HERE I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE BILL. UNLESS THERE'S GOING TO BE THE ABILITY FOR COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL WHICH IS WHICH IS YOUR FARMER IT'S YOUR THOSE ARE ENDED AND WE THEY'VE BEEN PAYING THE BILL FOR THE BAD DECISIONS AT THE STATE MADE FOR A LONG TIME. AND THEN RESIDENTIAL PEOPLE HAVE NOT HAD TO PAY THAT BILL AND IT'S NOT IT'S. IT'S NOT FAIR TO CONTINUE TO. HELLO A BURDEN ON THEM WHEN THEY DON'T GET ANYTHING BACK FOR THE SERVICE THAT'S MY PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF IT IF IT DOESN'T DO THAT. AND IT'S REALLY ON THE DEVELOPER. THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING THE DEVELOPER OF THIS PRODUCT WHICH I MEAN FOR I LOVE HYDROGEN I THINK THERE'S- A CLEAR NEED THE PIPELINE FOR. BUT IT'S- PAYS FOR AT THE END IF IT'S THE- IF IT'S GOING TO BE. THE INDUSTRIAL FOLKS AND ME SEAT OPPOSITION IT'S TO AGRICULTURAL AGRICULTURE ENERGY COMMISSION BECAUSE THOSE FOLKS PAY. THAT AMOUNT THEIR INDUSTRIAL- IN ANY IS. SO ANYWAY I I'M GONNA. I GOTTA GO CHECK INTO SO WE GET A CORPSMAN SUB TO AND ALL TRY TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION GO AHEAD AND- MOVE FORWARD. GIVE HER A BATH YEAH I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY I'M I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY AGAIN FURNITURE ARCHULETA BECAUSE I KNOW I REALLY. THINK THAT THE FUEL CELL HI IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT TO BRING IN TWO. THOUSAND JOBS BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IT KEEPS COMING BACK WE ALMOST NEED A LIST OF WHO WOULD HAVE TO PAY BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING THE PIPES TO THE GAS STATION OR WHATEVER. HE HAD A CHEVRON- YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT TOP COMPANY SO I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO WORK HARD ON THAT AND SINCE I AM ON APPROPRIATIONS ALSO. OF ALL BE ASKING THAT QUESTION AND SEEING IF THEY COUNT. GET A CLUE I THINK A- OR- DURING. ANDERSON OF WHO ARE HISPANIC AND THROUGH THE WHAT THE IS AND I THINK I THINK WE'LL GET THERE I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING SO I WAS I MEAN TO SUPPORT IT AGAIN TODAY THAT AS WE GET TO APPROPRIATIONS WE NEED HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU BUT I WANT TO HELP YOU MOVE IT ALONG.

ALL RIGHT SO WAS DOG A PRESENT TO BILLS SB TWO TWO TWO AND TWO TO THREE. AND- YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN- WHEN PERFECTLY SANITIZED. SURE I FEEL PERFECTLY SANITIZED THIS POINT TIED UP. WE TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. THE YOU MAY RECEIVE HONOR I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- S. B. TWO TWO TWO WOULD ESTABLISH THE WATER READ ASSISTANCE FUND YEAH THE WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO HELP PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR BOTH DRINKING AND WASTEWATER SERVICES TO LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS. WELL BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT ON PAGE TWELVE OF THE ANALYSIS. AS SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL I AUTHORED LEGISLATION AB FOUR ONE ASKING THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO STUDY THE LOGIN ISSUE OF LOW INCOME WATER RESISTANCE I PROGRAM LIRAS FOR SHORT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THE BOARD'S DONE THAT YET SB TWO TWO TAKES THE NEXT STEP OF BELIEVE FOR TO ENACT A WATER LITERATURE. IN ADDITION TO COMPLETING THE WATER LABOR STUDY THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD RECENTLY SURVEYED HUNDREDS COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS AROUND THE STATE TO TURN TO DETERMINE JUST HOW MUCH WATER DAD WATER SYSTEM CUSTOMERS. WERE- ACCRUING. THE SURVEY WE ARE SOBERING HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW SERIOUS THE PROBLEM WATER UNAFFORDABILITY HAS BECOME. OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR WATER BILLS THAT'S OVER FIVE BILLION PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR CLEAN SAFE DRINKING AND WASTEWATER. 12% OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS HAVE DEAD OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IT MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE DEBT GREATER THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS. CUMULATIVELY CALIFORNIANS OF ACCRUED ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN WATER DAD AND THAT NUMBER IS INCREASING AT AROUND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER MONTH. IT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PRE PANDEMIC OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ALREADY LOST THEIR WATER SERVICE DUE TO AN INABILITY TO PAY THEIR WATER BILLS. THAT NUMBER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC WATER RATES HAVE BEEN RISING FASTER THAN ANY OTHER UTILITY CHARGE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT ANNOUNCES PLAN TO RAISE ITS- RATES BY MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS. GROWING WATER DEBT IS ALSO A PROBLEM FOR WATER SYSTEMS SOME WATER SYSTEMS HAS LOST AS MUCH AS 30% OF THE REVENUE. AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS ARE FACING FINANCIAL COLLAPSE DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS TO PAY THEIR WATER BILLS. CALIFORNIA HAS LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR ELECTRICITY. AND NATURAL GAS UTILITIES. NOT WITHSTANDING THE STATE POLICY THAT AL ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. THERE IS NO COMPARABLE WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR PUBLICLY OWNED A COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE HAVE A STATE WIDE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR DRINKING AND WASTEWATER S. B. TWO TWO TWO IS A NARROW IT'S NARROWED ITS FOCUS ON DIRECT WATER RESISTANCE WATER CRISIS ASSISTANCE AND RENTER'S CREDITS. THE BILL REQUIRES THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP AN EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THE FUNDING NEEDS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THIS BILL DOES NOT IDENTIFY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE REDUCE SYSTEMS PROGRAM THAT IS A PARALLEL CONVERSATION IT'S BEGINNING TO TAKE PLACE. GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS WERE TAKING PLACE BETWEEN THE STAKEHOLDERS IN MY TEENS AND SEVERAL KEY AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN ALREADY BEEN MADE SUCH AS NARROWING THE SCOPE OF THE BILL NO LONGER REQUIRING THE COLLECTION OF WATERY DATA FOR EACH WATER AGENCY. AND PLACING ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WATER LARA PROGRAM WITH THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT. WELL THE MEMBERS HAVE ADDRESSED SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS I KNOW THERE'S MORE TO WORK ON AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT. I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS TO GET THIS LONG OVERDUE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED ON THE PHONE IS JONATHAN NELSON FROM THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER. AND NIKITA KHARADI FROM IN OUR DC I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS CRITICALLY NEEDED PROGRAM THANK YOU. FOR THE SENATOR AND SO IT'S GOING. TO YOUR NEARLY WITNESSES. IT'S AND AN- WE KICK. GOOD MORNING AND THANK CERTAINLY. JONATHAN NELSON IT WITHOUT WATER CENTER AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION THAT FIGHTS. WAS MAKING THE POINT WATER CALL CALIFORNIANS ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WORKS HERE- IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB Q. TWO TWO WHICH WOULD FINALLY PUT IN PLACE A FRAMEWORK FOR A STATEWIDE LOW INCOME WATER REDUCES IN PROGRAM. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL FOR US WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO ADDRESS THIS LONG STANDING GAPS AROUND THE LACK OF A PROGRAM THAT REACHES ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT NEED IT FOR SO MANY YEARS I MEAN IT HAS MISTER DAUGHTER HE. SHARED RIGHT WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC JUST DRAWING ATTENTION TO IT- AND- OUR WATER PORTABILITY CRISIS- FOR YEARS. WE WORK WITH FAMILIES THAT HAVE TO CHIU THE- WATER AND OTHER BASIC THAT SET. AT THE END BY JOBS ORGANIZER- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS THAT THIS CRISIS BRING TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE CORRECT THAT THE MATTER BE KICKED OUT THAT THE NEXT WEEK BUT- THIS IS- ISSUE THAT AFFECTS EVERY DISTRICT IN THE STATE IT HURTS URBAN AND RURAL. COMMUNITIES ALIKE WE APPRECIATE ON THE TOP LEFT OF THE FRAMEWORK ALSO THAT STRONG PROVISION TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS CAN BE A PART OF EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS. WE THANK SENATOR DR CAMPAIGN THAT THAT YOU TAKE THE REALLY IMPORTANT. STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. LET'S GO TO. THANK YOU MR TRYING NUMBERS CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I DON'T NEED TO STAND WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TWO TO TWO AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR DODD FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON WATER PORTABILITY ISSUES OVER THE YEARS. HAVE YOU ALREADY HEARD THE NEED FOR THE PROGRAM IS SIGNIFICANT AND WHILE THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO ASSIST LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THE BRIDE UTILITY BELT THERE IS CURRENTLY NO STATEWIDE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT STRUGGLING FAMILIES CAN STAY CURRENT ON THEIR BELTS WERE CENTRAL DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES. WELL BEFORE THE ECONOMIC DISRUPTION OF THE PANDEMIC MILLION THE CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLE TO PAY WATER AND WASTEWATER BILLS THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNAFFORDABLE AND THE REASON PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE FOR SHORT TERM WATER DEBT RELIEF IS CRITICAL BUT LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN WILL BE NEEDED TO WALK AFTER THE CONNECTICUT OAK. SB TWO TO RESPOND TO THE URGENT NEED FOR ACTION AND WE COMMEND SENATOR DODD FOR ADVANCING THAT SPRING MARC BUT IT MIGHT BOTH THE CAN BE COLLECTIVELY CONTINUE EXPLORING STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING OPTIONS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SIMILARLY CONSIDERING LEGISLATION TO CREATE A LONG TERM BILL AND PROGRAM AND ENERGY THEATER AND ARNOLD PARTNERS ARE ACTIVELY ADVOCATING FOR BOTH EMERGENCY AND LONG TERM WATER ASSISTANCE FUNDING FROM CONGRESS. BUT HAVING A SOLID PROGRAM STRUCTURE IN PLACE WILL ENABLE CALIFORNIA TO GET HELP OUT THE DOOR QUICKLY FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT SB TWO TO TWO AND- DRIVER TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKYOU TO THEM ALRIGHT SO LET'S NOW GO TO.

THIS IS CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AWKWARD HAS IMPOSED UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB TWO TWO TWO WE THINK THAT THERE CAN BE A GOOD LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR WATER. ILL US STILL NEEDS WORK WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT SENATOR DODD MADE IN THE APRIL TWENTY VERSION AND IN PARTICULAR THE CONVOCATION IN ARTICLE ONE REGARDING THE ALLOWED USES OF THE FUND. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR DODD IS AMENDING THE BILL TO DELETE THE PROPOSED RATE DATA COLLECTION PROVISIONS. WE DO THINK THAT ADDITIONAL CHANGES ARE NEEDED OR JUST GIVE TWO EXAMPLES TODAY. ONE IS THAT THE BILL NEEDS AN APPROPRIATE IN PROGRESSIVE FUNDING SOURCE. CURRENTLY THERE'S NO FUNDING SOURCE PROPOSED IN THE BILL. AND THEN SECOND ALL RIGHT NOW THE BILL PROPOSES THAT BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE WATER BOARD WITH APPROVED THE FUND EXPENDITURE PLAN WE SUGGEST THAT THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD APPROVE THE PLAN. AND THAT WOULD BE A CHANGE ON PAGE FIVE ONE TEN. WE THINK THAT- WITH MORE WORK SB TWO TWO TWO COULD BE A GOOD LOW INCOME MODERATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOOK. GREAT WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR GONZALEZ IT IS. BUT WE DON'T HAVE QUORUM YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE TO HOLD THE STAKES. WE NEVER ESTABLISHED IT- AND WE CAN'T.

AFTER OKAY GREAT SO WE ESTABLISH FORM WE DON'T HAVE IT NOW HOWEVER WE CAN TAKE A VOTE BUT WE WILL THEN LEAVE IT ON CALL. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS IS- DO PASSED AS AMENDED WITH THE COMMITTEES IMMENSE. AND YOU'VE ACCEPTED THOSE. AND SO WITH THAT WE WILL DO A ROLL CALL. I KNOW NUMBER TWO SP TWO TWO TWO BY SENATOR DODD THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. ALLEN BATES DALLY DALY NO GONZALEZ HI I WAS AYE SKINNER ALL RIGHT INNER THIGH STERN WHY CAO SKI. ALL RIGHT THE BILL'S ON CALL AND- BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL 2% CORRECT SENATOR DODD ALL RIGHT SO PLEASE PROCEED WITH- PRESENTING S. B. TWO TO THREE- MANAGER MEMBERS S. B. TWO TO THREE STRENGTHENS. IT EXTENDS EXISTING STATUTORILY REQUIRED PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES TO PROTECT LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE FACING WATER SERVICE DISCONNECTIONS DUE TO THE WATER CUSTOMERS INABILITY TO PAY THE WATER BILL. ONCE AGAIN I'M ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS. ADDITIONALLY I WANT TO KNOWLEDGE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED ON PAGE ELEVEN PERTAINING TO PROHIBITIONS ON MULTI TENANT BUILDING SHUT OFFS. I COMMIT TO WORKING WITH- THE CHAIR IN YOUR CONSOLE TO CRAFTED MA'AM IT'S THE PUT SOME LIMITS ON THAT PROHIBITION. STREAMLINED THE ABILITY OF ATTENDED TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WATER BILL FOCUS ON LOW INCOME TENANTS IF POSSIBLE GIVE WATER AGENCIES THAT ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS I GET TO SCOFFLAW LANDLORD. I WILL REPEAT THE SOBERING FINDINGS TO THE WATER BOARD SURVEY ON WATER DEBT I HIGHLIGHTED JUST. IN S. B. TWO TWO TWO TWO LET'S JUST SAY THOSE FINDINGS ILLUMINATED A PROBLEM WHICH HAS BEEN GETTING WORSE FOR YEARS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I AUTHORED SB NINE NINE EIGHT WHICH ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM WATER SHUT OFFS. SOME CRITICS OF SB TWO TO THREE ARE ASKING WHY WE NEED THIS BILL IN LIGHT OF S. B. NINE NINE EIGHT. THE ANSWER IS TWO FOLD. FIRST AS WATER DEBT IS DEEP IN THE PROBLEM PEOPLE AT LOSING ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER WASTEWATER. HAS REACHED CRISIS PROPORTIONS. SECOND THE FINAL VERSION OF SB NINE NINE EIGHT REFLECTED MANY COMPROMISES THAT I MADE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS BY THE OPPONENTS. SB TWO TO THREE IS INTENDED TO FILL SOME GAPS LEFT BY THE FINAL VERSION OF S. B. NINE NINE EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE. KERN SHUT OFF PROTECTION IS LIMITED TO WATER SYSTEMS WITH TWO HUNDRED OR MORE CONNECTIONS. S. B. T. TWO THREE PROPOSED TO INCLUDE SMALLER WATER SYSTEMS IT PROTECTION PROTOCOLS. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR BORDER AGENCIES TO SHUT OFF THE WATER WHEN THE REPAIR IS THE ONLY GOOD FOR SIXTY DAYS. FRANKLY THAT'S A TIGHT TIMELINE FOR A LOW INCOME WATER HOUSEHOLD TRYING TO FIND ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR EVEN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO CATCH UP ON THEIR THEIR CURRENT BILL. YEAH I WAS A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR- DID IN IT IN THE WATER BUSINESS AND- YOU KNOW JUST KNOWING. HE SIXTY DAYS IS JUST NOT ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO CATCH UP REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY A PRIVATE WATER SUPPLY OR EVEN A COMMERCIAL VENTURE. YES BE TWO TO THREE AS AMENDED GIVES A WATER RATEPAYERS NINETY DAYS OR WHEN THE RATEPAYERS ACCUMULATED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN DEBT. BEFORE SHUT OFFS COULD COMMENCE. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CURRENT LAW MADE BY S. B. TWO TWO THREE BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS WHAT. MIGHT BE THE MOST CONTROVERSY CONTROVERSY ALL PROVISION. AND THAT IS DEBT FORGIVENESS. THE INTRODUCED VERSION OF THE BILL REQUIRED WATER SYSTEMS TO OFFER INDEBTED LOW WATER LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS IN A REPAIR REAR H. MANAGEMENT PLAN. SB TWO TO THREE AMENDED THE RIG. OF ADS YES LET ME START OVER ON THAT ONE SB TWO TO THREE AS AMENDED REQUIRED THE WATER SYSTEMS TO MAKE FINDINGS ON THE RECORD THAT THEY HAVE NO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO FORGIVE THE DEBT. THERE IS NO LONGER MANDATE IN THE BILL THE WATER AGENCY MUST USE NOT REPAIR REVENUE FURTHER RESEARCH MANAGER PLAN IF THE AGENCY HAS A HIGHER PRIORITY USE. WHERE NON REPAIR FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE REAR. AND A REAL RICH- MANAGEMENT PLAN WOULD BE OFFERED. ONE FINAL POINT SB TWO TO THREE NOT ONLY PROTECTS STRUGGLING REPAIRS BUT WHEN COMBINED WITH WATER LITERATURE ALSO PROTECTS THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. IN THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS I MENTIONED IT TO ARE IN A PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL CONDITION- BY PRESERVING THEIR REVENUE FLOW. AS WE TO THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL YEAH I'M COMMITTED TO DOING SO WE'RE LISTENING TO THE STAKEHOLDERS IN IMPROVING THE BILL WITH EVERY WORKING SESSION I ASK FOR AND I'VE VOTE ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BILL. ON THE PHONE IN MY KEY WITNESSES MICHAEL CLAIBORNE AND LAURA FEINSTEIN THANK YOU FOR OUR MODERATOR LET'S START WITH THOSE- WITNESSES LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF FOOTWEAR BORN AND MISS FEINSTEIN. AND- THE T. WHAT I'M TRYING TO CHOI WITH OUR TIME LIMITED ON FOR AT LEAST WITNESSES. FIVE THREE MINUTES SO PLEASE INTERVIEW MAKE SURE TO ACCOMMODATE SO THAT YOU DON'T CUT OUT ANOTHER STEIN GO AHEAD MOTOR. YOUR LINE SHOULD BE ALL BUT. ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S MICHAEL CLAIBORNE- DIRECTING ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT WORKING ALONGSIDE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN THE SAN JOAQUIN IT CONTROL OF ALEX. CALIFORNIA DECLARED ACCESS TO AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF SAFE DRINKING WATER OR HUMAN RIGHT IN TWENTY TWELVE BUT THE REALITY REMAINS THE ACT THAT THE TAP WATER IS NOT UNIVERSAL IN THAT STATE. VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS THAT MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST ACCESS TO WATER IN BOTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN TO THE WATER SHOPS. THE STATEWIDE PROBLEM BECAUSE SOME AREAS ARE HIT HARDER THAN OTHERS THE HIGHEST RATES OF UTILITY DEBT PUTTING FAMILIES AT RISK OF SHUT OFF ARE IN LOS ANGELES SANTA MARIA RANCHO CORDOVA HOLDEN BELL GARDENS. NORWALK IN CYPRUS. THIS IS AN INEQUITABLE SYSTEM PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE HIT HARDEST WITH BLACK FAMILIES TWICE AS LIKELY AS WHITE. WATER SHOP SHOP. SB TWO TO THREE WOULD HELP BY EXTENDING AND STRENGTHENING WATER SHUT UP PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT SHOPS ARE USED ONLY AS A LAST RESORT. SALI WHEN APPLIED TO LOW INCOME AND VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS. ONE ISSUE FLAGGED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS THE PROPOSED- A PROHIBITION ON MULTI FAMILY SHOPS AT PRACTICE THAT IMPACTED AT MINIMUM SIXTY SEVEN HUNDRED MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS AND THE STATE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. DISASSEMBLE ATTENDANT SHOULD NOT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN LOSE ACCESS CENTRAL DRINKING WATER SERVICE BECAUSE THEIR LANDLORD FAILED TO PAY WATER BILL. WATER SYSTEMS CAN USE OTHER MECHANISMS TO COLLECT FROM PROBLEM LANDLORDS INCLUDING LEANS COLLECTIONS FOR PROPERTY TAXES REFERRAL PRIVATE COLLECTION AND COLLECTIONS ARE THE COURTS. WATER SYSTEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN UNIT WILL DISTRICT ALREADY PRE PROHIBIT MULTI FAMILY SHOPS AND OTHERS LIKE LADWP SHUT UP MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS ONLY VERY RARELY. PROTECTING TENANTS FROM SHUT OFF AS POSSIBLE AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE ASK. THAT THE COMMITTEE ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN DO NOT GROW UP IN HOMES THAT HAVE NO. OR ONLY SPORADIC ACT THAT THE TAP WATER AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES CRITICAL TO HEALTH SANITATION AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT. JUST A CLOSE LOOK THANK THE SENATOR DODD FOR LEADERSHIP. ON THAT ISSUE.

THANK GOD HE WATER IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH AND HAVE YOU HEARD FROM SENATOR DODD OF ONE POINT SIX MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR WATER VALVES CURRENTLY DURING THE- RECESSION. UNDER CURRENT POLICY MANY OF THOSE CUSTOMERS WILL LOSE ACCESS TO WATER INTO THE SHOP MARCH ARE IN THE LIST AND- WE NEED TO ACT NOW TO A CERTAIN EPIDEMIC WATER. SHUT OFFS AMONG LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. MAN PLAN KILLER HAVE BEEN USED WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY UTILITIES IN OTHER STATES THEY OFFER A BALANCED APPROACH TO HANDLING CUSTOMER UTILITY THAT. EVERY URGE MANAGEMENT PLAN DOESN'T FORGET THAT CONDITIONALLY RATHER FOR QUALIFIED LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS IT FORGET THE PORTION OF DEBT IN EXCHANGE FOR ON TIME IN FULL BILL PAYMENT. SHARES MANAGEMENT PLANS WHEN TARGETED CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REPAY THEIR DEBTS ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND THE UTILITY THE CUSTOMER GOING TO SHUT OFF AND THE UTILITY RETAIN A PAYING CUSTOMER. PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES YOU COULD REPLICATE MANY FINANCIAL OUTLOOK. BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE ESSENTIAL PART OF THEIR MISSION PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO CANNOT PAY THEIR WATER BILLS WHICH THEY CANNOT PAY FOR OUT OF THE RACE CARE ACT YEAH THIS BILL IS ACTING WATER. IT'S REMARKABLE. PLEASE WRAP UP OKAY.

THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DANIEL HI BUT THE CALIFORNIA UTILITIES GROUP AT THE CENTER MAYOR RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON AT THE 223% ONE I THINK THAT CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE THE AUTHOR IN THE- H. METALWORKER. THE BILL HOWEVER SEVERAL TROUBLING PROVISIONS REMAIN AND I WILL FOCUS ON TO TODAY. OUR FIRST WE CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED WITH THE LANGUAGE REGARDING ARREARS MANAGEMENT PLAN WHILE SOME OF THE LANGUAGES ARE MENTIONED THAT PROCESS DEVALUATION ON RATE REVENUE AND OTHER REPORTS AND SHOULD BE LEFT THE LOCAL PROGRESSION. CANNOT BE A REQUIREMENT AS PROPOSED IN SB TWO TO THREE. BY CONTRAST THE NEW VERSION OF THE BILL NO LONGER REQUIRED HE ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY TPC REGULATED UTILITIES ONLY A REQUIREMENT FOR THE- UC TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A PILOT PROGRAM. IT WILL SEND SAID IF IT IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ALL RATE PAYERS. IN ADDITION THIS MORNING SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE TO IS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL THAT INCLUDES ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR COVERT NINETEEN RELATED WATER ELECTRIC BILL OR AGENTS. THIS WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO RATEPAYERS NOTED IN IT IS A BETTER APPROACH THAN THE LANGUAGE AND HAVE BEAT YOU TO THREE. SECOND JANUARY OF NUMEROUS NUMBERS THAT ARE COMBINED UTILITIES MEANING THAT PROVIDE MULTIPLE SERVICES INCLUDING WATER WASTE WATER AND ELECTRICITY. OFTENTIMES BE UTILITIES ARE ON ONE BILL WHICH IS ATTENTION FOR BOTH THE CUSTOMER AND THE UTILITY. S. B. T. G. THREE INCLUDE THE PROHIBITION. ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF WATER SERVICE IF THE CUSTOMER PAYS A PARTIAL BILL EQUAL TO THE COST OF THAT SERVICE. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC AND UNNECESSARY IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT IT MAY BE LOGISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE OUT MULTIPLE SERVICES AND IT IS UNFAIR TO OTHER UTILITIES. IN FACT THIS COULD MAKE PAYMENT FOR AT THE VERY LEAST WASTEWATER SERVICE OPTIONAL BECAUSE WASTEWATER SERVICE CANNOT BE DISCONTINUED. AND IMPORTANTLY ACCORDING TO OUR MEMBERS IF A CUSTOMER ENTERS INTO A PAYMENT PLAN FOR OVER DEVELOP WITH MULTIPLE COMPONENTS NO. SERVICES WILL BE TERMINATED. BUSINESS SHOULD BE DELAYED. AGAIN WE- AGAIN MY RIGHT. THE GOVERNOR WORK AND LOOK FORWARD TO WITH DODD AND- ON BILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL NEXT TO CHRIS FOR INTER.

SB TWO TO THREE IS NOT THE ANSWER SB TWO TO THREE PROPOSALS THAT PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES SHOULD USE ON REPAIR REVENUE TO GET CUSTOMER THAT PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES OR NOT FOR PROFIT ENTITIES LARGELY FUNDED BY REPAIR SERVICE RATES AQUA MEMBERS WORK EXTENSIVELY WITH CUSTOMERS THAT FALL BEHIND ON THEIR BILLS. HOWEVER SINCE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES ARE NOT FOR PROFIT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY CANNOT CREATE SENATE STRUCTURES FOR PEOPLE TO NOT PAY THEIR WATER BILLS. TO THE EXTENT PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES HAVE NON RATE PAIR REVENUE SOURCES THIS REVENUES USED FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER PROJECTS REPAIRS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND MUCH MORE. SB TWO TO THREE PROPOSES THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCY SHOULD ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL BY SUGGESTING THIS RECOGNITION THAT BEING IS FORGET FORGET MOST NOTABLY WASPI TWO TO THREE WOULD REQUIRE THOUSANDS OF PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES UNDERTAKEN EXHAUSTIVE DEBT FORGIVENESS STUDY THE BILL PLACES NO SUCH MANDATES ON PRIVATE WATER AGENCIES FINALLY AS YOU JUST HEARD.

OKAY I HEAR A MOTION FOR THE BILL- AND NEAR THE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS ARE FINISHED REGARDING MISSED THE FIRST PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS ASKED BY THOSE IN A WHO ARE OPPOSING OFTEN BOUGHT IN MY DISTRICT AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS THE PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO THE MANDATE AND- IS THERE A DO YOU HAVE YOU WANT TO. ANSWER THAT ARE YOU WANT TO COVER THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES. YOU KNOW THAT- I'M NOT I'M NOT REALLY TO BE HONEST WITH THE AT THE- ABLE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT- YEAH RICK RIGHT HERE IT IS SOMETHING THAT- IN I THINK WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BECAUSE THE PROHIBITION MAY BE ON THE- TO EIGHTEEN- PROHIBITION AND THAT THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED THAT THAT'S THAT'S IN STATUTE TODAY- MAY. YEAH THAT WAS A BALLOT ISSUE SO THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE- THE- THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT NOT WITHSTANDING- STILL REMAINS AN ISSUE BUT- THE- DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT- THAT'S A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO ABANDON ARC OF MOVEMENT TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LOW INCOME- WATER USERS- THAT- GET INERT IT ARREARS SHOULD HAVE THEIR- WATER SHUT OFF- WITHOUT HAVING SOME SORT OF- WATER. A RICH MANAGEMENT PLAN OFFERED TO THEM. FIGURE FROM MY CONCERN IS THAT OF KIND OF. THE COOKIE CUTTER IN IT WOULD SEEM BETTER APPLIED ON ON A MORE ON. DISTRICT BY DISTRICT OR AGENCY BY AGENCY SO- I JUST NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE. INFORMATION ON IT AND SENATOR DODD AND LOOK AT LITTLE CLOSER ON THE END OF I WILL I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A NOBLE CONCEPT. THAT IF YOU'RE BEHIND ON YOUR WATER AND YOUR FOOD THE ESSENTIALS OF LIFE DATA THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF FORGIVENESS OR PAYMENT PLAN OR SOME WAY TO GET TO GET CAUGHT UP. THAT TO DEFINE HOW TAKE OF THOSE VERY OF. BASICS AWAY BUT THIS IS LIKE GETTING ME THERE TODAY ABOUT CALM HOW OF THE OPPOSING IT BUT I WILL BE. CONVERSING WITH YOU AFTERWARDS THANK YOU.

FOR PUBLIC NOTICE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE AIMS TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS WITH DTS SEES VIOLATING SCORING PROCEDURE OTHERWISE KNOWN AS B. S. B. ACCURATE ACCURATELY ACCOUNT FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE. BOB BEFORE MOVING ON I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR VERY MUCH IN THE COMMITTEE STUFF OFF FOR THE DISCUSSION AND THE DEBATE THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING THE- IT'S BEEN VERY IMPORTANT. FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE NEAR THE SEVENTY EIGHT HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE. LARGELY UNSERVED LOW INCOME LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR NEED GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT THEM. SB SIX SEVENTY THREE- INSTRUCTED DTS SEEK TO DEVELOP A MECHANISM TO IMPACTING ENVIRONMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS PART OF CONSIDERING A NEW MODIFIED OR PERMIT. RENEWAL THE TSC DECIDED THE BSP MODEL UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT VS P. MODEL HAS RESULTED IN FACILITIES HAVING SCORES THAT DO NOT REFLECT THE TRUE IMPACT AND MAC MAGNITUDE. OF HARM BROUGHT ON BY THEIR VIOLATIONS. WITH P. IS A THREE STEP. PROCESS OF INSPECTIONS VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED IS SCORED WITH THOSE SCORES ADDED AND DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS TO COME UP WITH THAT FACILITIES SCORING COMPLIANCE TIER ASSIGNMENT. THE PROBLEM IS THE VISION BY INSPECTIONS HAS RESULTED IN FACILITIES RECEIVING A LITTLE B. S. PEACE CORPS AND TEAR ASSIGNMENT THE JUST DOES NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THEIR IMPACTS DESPITE HAVING A HIGH NUMBER OF SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. ALL DUE TO THE NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS THIS INHIBITS VS P. FROM ACCURATELY ACCURATELY REFLECT THE NAY FACILITIES COMPLIANCE HISTORY AND COMMUNITY IMPACT WITH THE NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE VALUE OF THE VIOLATIONS THEMSELVES. SITE VISITS ARE BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS WITH SOME FACILITIES RECEIVING ONE INSPECTION AND OTHERS AS MANY AS TWENTY SIX THERE ISN'T AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY DIVISION BY INSPECTIONS WOULD HELP ACCOUNT FOR COMPLIANCE IN THE VSP FORMULA IN FACT. INCREASED INSPECTIONS SHOULD BE RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT A FACILITIES COMPLIANCE WHICH IS WHY ANOTHER REASON THIS STEP SHOULD BE REMOVED ALL TOGETHER. SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE REMOVES THE INSPECTION DIVISION FROM B. S. B. AND WREAK CALIBRATES THE BSP'S CORE AND TEAR RANKING SYSTEM BASED ON THE TOTAL. NUMBER AND TYPE OF BY. COMMITTED TO BETTER BUT ENSURE OVERSIGHT OF THESE FACILITIES OUR INTENT IS TO NOT AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN THE FACILITIES WE WANT THE FACILITIES TO CARRY OUT THEIR BUSINESS. BUT BECAUSE THE FACILITY THAT HANDLES TOXIC WASTE DOES NOT GIVE IT THE AUTHORITY TO OPERATE OUTSIDE OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTENDED OR NOT. WITH P. WAS CREATED THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND WAS PRESENTED S A- TOOL TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITIES BUT IT HAS NOT MET ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. WE ARE NOT BY PASSING THE REGULATORY PROCESS DTIC TOOK US THROUGH THE PROCESS AND MADE ITS DECISION. THE DEPARTMENT DECIDED THAT SOME FACILITIES ARE JUST TOO COMPLEX AND TOO HARD TO REGULATE. ARE CONSIDERED CONSTITUENTS IDENTIFY PROBLEMS IN THE LOT IMPACT THEIR HEALTH HEALTH AND WELLBEING. ALL WE NEED CLEAR VIA IT'S CLEAR VS P. NEEDS TO BE FIXED. MY COMMUNITY AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT BY TOXIC WASTE POLLUTION AND IT WAS RECENTLY HIGHLIGHTED BY THE EXITE BURNED FACILITY BANKRUPTCY CASE. MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OF UNDER WHILE MAIN STATE OVERSIGHT LED TO DEVASTATING GENERATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN. FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES CANNOT WAIT FOR ANOTHER DRAG THAT PROCESS THE DOES NOT GUARANTEE NEEDED CHANGES. FACILITIES WITH BAD COMPLIANCE HISTORIES NEED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR. OTHER FACILITIES ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING SHOULD NOT BE DISADVANTAGED. THIS PROPOSAL LINES VS P. WITH THIS PURPOSE AS INTENDED BY SB SIX SEVENTY THREE AND I FINALLY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE TEAMSTERS UNION REGARDING THE MANY WORKERS THAT THEY REPRESENT. I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR THOSE WORKERS I SPENT MY LIFE AS A LABOR LEADER I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PICK BETWEEN WORKERS EARNING GOOD WAGES GOOD BENEFITS. AND THE HEALTH AND THE WELL BEING OF THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY- I COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE TSC COMMITTEE AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY AND EFFECTIVELY MISTER CHAIR WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND HELP ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. A. R. ANGELA JOHNSON MESZAROS MANAGING ATTORNEY OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM FOR IT JUSTICE AND REBEKAH OVERMYER VELAZQUEZ OF THE CLEAN AIR COALITION OF NORTH WOULD YOUR AND OF ALL THE PEDAL HEIGHTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU COULD YOU WITNESSES. HELLO YES WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SENATOR ALLEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND ANGELA JOHNSON MESZAROS THE MANAGING ATTORNEY AT EARTHJUSTICE. SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE IS BASED ON TWO VERY SIMPLE IDEAS HAZARDOUS WASTE IS HAZARDOUS AND SAFE HANDLING OF HAZARDOUS WASTE IS IMPORTANT. WE ALL SHOULD HAVE VISIBILITY INTO WHICH FACILITIES ARE VIOLATING THE LAW AND THEREFORE PUTTING COMMUNITIES AT RISK OF FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES DEMANDED. VISIBILITY ALLOWS REGULATORS TO ACT TO STOP HARM BECAUSE BOTH THE PRICE OF CLEAN UP AND THE COST TO HEALTH FROM DELAYED ACTION FOR WORSE NINE ACTION IS ENORMOUSLY HIGH. AUTHORITIES THAT BENEFIT FROM DTS HE'S CURRENT SYSTEM ARGUE OTHERWISE SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE SIMPLY SEEKS TO ENSURE CLEAR ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THAT OUT SIX SEVENTY THREE. WHICH FACILITIES HAVE THE MOST CLASS WHEN VIOLATIONS HOW SIGNIFICANTLY DO THOSE VIOLATIONS IMPACT HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND WHEN IS ENOUGH ENOUGH.

UNDER THE BILL A FACILITY WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF INFECTION BUT BUT LACKS THE GREETED BY ALICIA COULD SEE OF THE F. P. SCORE THAT DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE FACILITY DRESSED AS COMPARED TO ANOTHER FACILITY WITH INFECTIONS THAT MORE EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS.

GONZALEZ I SKINNER STERN MY CASCADE OKAY REALLY EVEN OPEN LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH. THREE DIFFERENT HEARINGS HAVING RIGHT NOW AS YOU KNOW AS CENTER SO THANK YOU DO A- PROCEDURE WORK ON THIS OKAYBUT SAYS THE LONG. PATIENT CENTERED BAKER WHETHER IT IS NOW. NOW LEARN WHAT HE'S GONNA DO ON SEVERAL OF THESE EQ BILLS AS THEY GET TO THE FOR. I GIVEN HIS PRESENCE HERE HE'S HE'S- GETTING INTO THE INTERESTING AND- THE CARD ISSUE OF CEMENT. CONCRETE SO- BUT WE'LL HEAR FROM U. S. SENATE BAKER THIS IS NASTY. FIVE NINETY SIX. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN NUMBER MEMBERS OF. FIFTY FIVE NINETY SIX AS YOU MENTIONED IS ABOUT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE CEMENT AND CONCRETE SECTOR. CONCRETE IS MOST WIDELY USED BUILDING MATERIAL IN THE WORLD. A LITTLE TRIVIA HE MADE OBJECTS NOW OUTWEIGH ALL LIVING THINGS ON EARTH. CRITICIZED CIVIC MARKET. AND CONCRETE BECAUSE MADE. THE FOURTEENTH ALSO MAJOR SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES. COUNTY FOR ABOUT 7% OF GLOBAL CO TWO EMISSIONS. IT'S THE SECOND LARGEST INDUSTRIAL SOURCE OF GHG EMISSIONS IN OUR STATE. ISRAEL AGREED TO STOP USING CONCRETE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO MAKE IT WITH FAR LESS IMPACT ON OUR CLIMATE. THIRD ENERGY INNOVATION IDENTIFIED ESTABLISHING A PERFORMANCE STANDARD FOR MISSIONS FROM CONCRETE AND CEMENT AS ONE OF ITS TOP POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESSES EXIST FOR KEEPING LARGE REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS FROM CONCRETE CEMENT. AS ONE OF OUR WITNESSES WILL DESCRIBE. THESE TECHNOLOGIES OF USUALLY NOT BEEN DEPLOYED AT SCALE. THE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DEMAND FOR LOW CARBON PRODUCTS FROM CUSTOMERS. I DO NOT BEEN ENOUGH REGULATORY INCENTIVES TO DRIVE CHANGE. PICKUP TRUCK MARKET BELOW TWENTY DOLLARS A TONNE MANY EMISSIONS REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES THAT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN COST EFFECTIVE. IF YOU WERE TO THE BILL WITHOUT THE CEMENT INDUSTRY TO BE WILLING PARTNER AND SHIPPING THESE GOALS BECAUSE THEY CAN PROVIDE A SUPPORTIVE POLICY ENVIRONMENT AND ADDRESS BARRIERS THAT EXIST TODAY. IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA CEMENT ASSOCIATION PUBLISHED A PAPER IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR. FROM AN INTEREST COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND IDENTIFYING PATHWAYS FOR GPS. BUT ALSO POINT OUT AREAS WERE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO UNLOCK THOSE PATHWAYS. THIS BILL AIMS TO CREATE THE RIGHT SUPPORTER FRAMEWORK. TO CHECK OF COURTNEY CHARLIE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND SAID INTERM TARGET A 40% REDUCTION EMISSIONS. INTENSITY BY TWENTY THIRTY TO SPUR NEAR TERM ACTION. DISTRICT COURT TO DO NUMBER THINGS INCLUDE HELP WITH STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING THESE TARGETS AND DR NASSAR REGULATIONS DRIVE DEMAND. FOR LOW COST MATERIALS TO CREATE INCENTIVES. FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS WHILE PROTECTING PRODUCERS PRODUCERS FROM UNFAIR COMPETITION. TRAVESTY PRODUCERS. WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RULES. THIS IS A LOT. TO PUT WHATEVER HARD TO DECARBONISE INDUSTRIES BUT A PATH. TO CARBON NEUTRAL FUTURE. AND ESPECIALLY HIS TASK FOR EITHER. WE TO ASSIST ANYBODY ON THE PHONE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. DR BOB ABSTAINED THE CO FOUNDER PROJECT TWENTY THIRTY. INTERVIEW TO. IN TOUCH OF COURSE ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE UCLA INSTITUTE FOR CARBON MANAGEMENT. AND RECENT CARBON X. PRIZE WINNER FIRST TEAMS WORK ON STORING CO TWO IN CONCRETE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR- SENATOR. SPECTER LET'S NOT TO BOB DEAN FROM PROBABLY TWENTY THIRTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR BACKER IN COMMITTEE PURSUING OUR GOALS OUR CLIMATE GOALS WE NEED TO CHALLENGE OUR THINKING BEYOND EMISSIONS FROM ENERGY SOURCES AND WE NEED TO INCLUDE INDUSTRIAL SOURCES. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS NO INDUSTRIAL POLICY PLAN FOR CEMENT CONCRETE AND WHAT THAT SEVEN ACTIVE DOMESTIC CEMENT FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITS IMPOSED BY CAP AND TRADE CEMENT IMPORTS HAVE NO LIMITATIONS CONCRETE SUPPLIERS ALSO KNOW HOW TO PRODUCE CONCRETE WITH GLASS EMBEDDED EMISSIONS. BUT THERE'S LITTLE TO NO ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO DO SO THE SITUATION REMINDS ME OF THE PEOPLE'S MARKET IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT R. TO THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD THERE IS NO TARGETED ECONOMIC STRUCTURE TO ENCOURAGE AND REWARD INNOVATION TODAY. THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE OSTEOPATHS CREDITS HIS PRODUCT INNOVATION AND BILLIONS OF GALLON EQUIVALENT LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION FUEL THE MARKET. WHAT ELSE HE AFFECTED PER PEOPLE'S SB FIVE NINETY SIX CAN DO CHRISTIAN MAN IN CONCRETE INDUSTRIES BY TELLING CARP TO TREAT DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED CEMENT WITH HE SAME RULES AND CREATE ECONOMIC VALUE FOR THE CEMENT AND CONCRETE- SUPPLIERS WITH THE LOWEST EMISSIONS. CALIFORNIA HAS THE INDUSTRY'S THE PEOPLE THE MOTIVATION TO EXECUTE A LOW CARBON CONCRETE CEMENT STRTEGY MOVING SB FIVE NINETY SIX FORWARD WILL NOT ONLY MAKE CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION MORE SECURE AND CLEAN TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP TO THE REST OF THE WORLD TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM A MAJOR SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES ARE ASKED FOR YOUR I.

AND WE BASE TO ALLOW. IT TOO OFTEN ONE OF THIS NEARBY CITIES TO OPT INTO THE ONE OF THOSE CARBS OR TARGET AIR QUALITY CITIES.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- YOU KNOW WHAT TO THAT POINT COULD BE GREAT AS AS MOVES ALONG TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN IF IT IF THE SHOULD PASS TO BE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR.

HELLO MY COMMENT SAID GOOD MORNING THAT WAS APPARENTLY OPTIMISTIC SEPT GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS COMMITTEE OF FOR WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF. ON THIS PROPOSAL AND THIS BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE OPERATING ON WHERE IT WAS BEFORE AS AMENDED SO LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR. SENATE BILL SIX NINETEEN SUPPORTS CONTINUED EFFORTS BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ACHIEVE STATEWIDE ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING TARGETS AND CLIMATE GOALS. S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BY THEN SENATOR RICARDO LARA. ESTABLISHED AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM AND SCHEDULE FOR ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS LAW AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT ITS IMPLEMENTATION. THIS BILL WHICH HAS BEEN AMENDED SINCE FIRST INTRODUCED NOW KEEPS THE IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE. BUT GIVES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS A BREAK ON ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES FOR ONE YEAR. IT FURTHER MY GOAL TO ADD TO THIS BILL ADDITIONAL TOOLS THAT WILL HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MEET THE GOALS WITHIN SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I'M CURRENTLY WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL RECYCLE TO ESTABLISH WHAT FORM THAT HELP MIGHT TAKE RISKS SO IT IS MY HOPE. THAT A FINAL BILL WILL HAVE TWO PIECES OF REASONABLE STEPS TOWARD IMPLEMENTATION THAT WARRANT A ONE YEAR OLD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES BUT NOT TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION. AND A LATER SECTION WHICH WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH IMPLEMENTATION I WAS GOING TO PRESENT A LONG. A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE ORIGINAL BILL DOES AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO DIVERT ORGANIC WASTE BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GOING TO SAY THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THAT- BUT WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TIM CONTRA RAFI THE ZERO WASTE MANAGER FOR SANTA CRUZ CUNTY. AND ADRIAN FIGUEROA THE PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF PARAMOUNT. AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP ON THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN IPHONE THANK YOU BRICKYARDS LET'S GO OVER TO TEN WITH SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. GOOD AFTERNOON CAROLINE AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF. SB SIX NINETEEN. EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S AN INCREASE COUNTY IS VERY PROACTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE BY MENTAL PROTECTION A WASTE REDUCTION. BUT EVEN FOR US MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS TOUGH. THERE ARE THREE MAIN CHALLENGES. FIRST THE COST IS ENORMOUS COVERAGE ESTIMATES THAT WE WILL NEED THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW FACILITIES ALONE. THAT MUCH MORE FOR STAFFING VEHICLES ANOTHER PROGRAM COSTS. BETTER TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE CONSERVE AND PRESIDENT OF NATURAL DISASTERS. LOCAL PANDEMIC PERSUADING VOTERS ON ELECTED OFFICIALS TO RAISE RATES ARE TAXES FOR COMPOSTING IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY THE LEAST. THE SECOND GREATEST CHALLENGES PERMITTED WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVEN DIFFERENT AGENCIES WHICH MONTHS MUST SIGN OFF ON OUR PLANS. SOME OF WHICH ARE QUITE HOSTILE TO SUCH FACILITIES. ARE LESS GREAT CHALLENGES TIME. INTEL CARRIED CYNICAL FINALIZED THE REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DEVELOPING ORDINANCES. IMPLEMENTING TAX RATE INCREASES AMENDING WASTE HAULING CONTRACTS. FINALIZING PLANS FOR NEW FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS ALL OF THESE EFFORTS REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND EXPENSE LOLS WERE ONLY FINALIZED. LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HELP TODAY WITH THE OR THE PERMANENT. BUT YOU CAN BUY US A LITTLE TIME BY DELAYING ENFORCEMENT OF THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IT SEEMS AT LEAST THAT OUR STATE CAN DO TO EASE THE BURDEN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. YEAH THERE'S A NEXT WITNESS. YES AUDIBLE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON ADRIANA FIGUEROA ON THE PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF PARAMOUNT. TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY LOCATED IN THE SOUTHEAST AREA OF ALLENTOWN ALSO KNOWN AS THE GAME WILL BE JAN OUR CITY IS ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF FOUR MILES AND IT'S A FULLY BUILT OUT AND THEN COMMUNITY WITH APPROXIMATELY.

IT THE SALUTES GO TO MICHAEL FIRST. GREETINGS MY NAME IS MICHAEL BISH I'MTHE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF YELLOW CREEPING ON SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO SB SIX NINETEEN AS AMENDED. AND IT'S DELAYING AND WEAKENING OF PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH EDIBLE COOPER COVERAGE MANDATES. WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGAL MAXIM JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS BILL REPRESENTS JUSTICE TONIGHT. INDEED THIS BILL ACTUALLY PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE. REALLY IN THIS AGE OF RACIAL RECKONING WHERE IS THE EQUITY INCLUSION THE COMPASSION. THEY ARE COMPLETELY ABSENT. I AM NOT A LOBBYIST I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON LEGISLATIVE MATTERS I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE MACHINATIONS OF POLITICAL OR STRATEGIC GOING ON AROUND THIS BILL. BUT I KNOW A LOT ABOUT FEEDING MY STRUGGLING NEIGHBORS IN YOUR LOCALITY. I LEAD A SMALL ROLE FOOD BANK FEEDING SIXTY THOUSAND PLUS INDIVIDUALS MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER MONTH. THIS BILL DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE IT FEEDS THE LANDFILL THE DELAYS MEETING THE NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY AND NEAR POVERTY. IT DELAYS NURSING TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING WITH POVERTY AND NEAR POVERTY INCLUDING CHILDREN SENIORS VETERANS FARMWORKERS UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. AND HARD WORKING FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IT'S BEEN NICE TO ARM OF OUR NEIGHBORS IN THE MIDST OF AN ON CARILLO PUBLIC HEALTH. ISSUE ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT DOES SO IN THE MIDST OF A CLIMATE CRISIS IMPERILING THE WELL BEING OF EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD. PLANET EARTH.

FIVE YEARS WHAT HAVE THEY DONE IN THAT TIME. LOBBYING THE LADY AND OBFUSCATE. THEIR ARGUMENTS EVEN NOW ARE DIVORCED FROM THE FAX. THE CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A DUTY TO THEIR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS THEY MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO SHIRK THEIR DUTY. APATHY AND INDIFFERENCE TO SUFFERING AND DISPARITIES MUST END. NOW AT THIS TIME AND JUSTICE MUST BEGIN ALL END WITH A QUOTE FROM NOBLE PEACE LAUREATE NORMAN BULLOCK. WITHOUT FOOD MAN CAN LIVE AT MOST BUT A FEW WEEKS.

THE MOST OBVIOUS PROBLEM IS THE POLITICAL SPHERE TO WASTE COLLECTION FEES FOR ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING HOW WE CYCLE ESTIMATED THREE TO FIVE DOLLAR AMOUNT. INCREASE THE HOUSEHOLD.

THANK YOU THANK YOU I REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS MADE BY EVERYBODY INCLUDING OPPOSITION- JUST WANTING TO CLARIFY FOR MISS AB FIVE. SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW I CITIES SHE RECEIVED MADE REFERENCE THE CITY'S LACK OF A REASONABLE EFFORT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IF CALIFORNIANS POWER CYCLE- FINDS IN A JURISDICTION DID NOT MAKE A REASONABLE EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH A THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND CARMICHAEL CAN IMPOSE FINES AND THEY SHOULD. SO THERE'S A PROTECTION THERE LET ME LET ME JUST START BY BY SAYING HOW IMPORTANT THAT SB THIRTY THREE REGULATIONS ARE FOR ME AND FOR THIS COMMITTEE. WHEN IT COMES TO ACHIEVING OUR SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT GOALS AND- I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE NEW DIRECTION OF THE AUTHOR'S TECH AND WE YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE. WITH WHERE THE BILL WAS WHEN ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED- I'M I DO THINK IN THE END OF THE DAY- THE AUTHOR WITH THIS NEW DIRECTION HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RELIEVE ANXIETY- NOTED THAT SOME OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE BEEN FEELING WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND- I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT I THINK- YOU KNOW WHAT'S AWESOME IT. WAS ALSO NEEDED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHAT WHAT WE WILL REALLY GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO START IMPLEMENTING THE ORGANIC WASTE REDUCTION PROGRAMS IS A FUNDING MECHANISM IN THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS ON THE FLOOR. SOME SOME SORT OF ONE TIME APPROPRIATION FOR THE GENERAL FUND OR G. G. OR F. TO HELP COVER THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS START UP COSTS. THIS REALLY YOU COMPLIANCE IN WITH WITH THIRTY THREE IS NOT EASY. WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT AND- AND YEAH WE'VE NEVER REALLY INTERESTED- BUDGETARY EARLY AND SO IT'S A SOME SORT OF FUNDING MECHANISM I WOULD IN THURSDAY'S YES WE SUPPORT AYE AYE I KNOW. EITHER THE AUTHOR SHARES THAT THAT SENTIMENT- YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE REALLY WANT TO HELP JURISDICTIONS COMPLY WITH THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THIS IS- THAT'S THE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP IN. AND OF COURSE THE COMPLIANCE MEANS HELPING US ALL ACHIEVE OUR- OUR CLIMATE GOALS. SO I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY ALREADY BE. CONTEMPLATING INSERTING SOME SORT OF FUNDING INTO THE BILL I'M VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT DEVELOPS THERE I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING OUR CONCERNS FOR HEARING OPPOSITION CONCERNS AS YOU CAN AS YOU CONTINUE O WORK ON GETTING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FUNDING ASSISTANCE I DO THINK THAT THE DIRECTION YOU'VE TAKEN. HIM AND MAYBE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ISN'T FULLY AWARE OF THE DIRECTION YOU'VE TAKEN WITH THE BILL I THINK IT. IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO GO A LONG WAY TOWARD. TOWARD ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CORE CONCERNS HE HEARD ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE IT'S REALLY SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD OVER HERE IN THE COMMITTEE. SO I DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND ENGINEERS WOULD LOVE TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR TO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR CONCERNS THOUGHTS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF THEY ARE IF THEY HAVE ANY. OKAY PARTISAN GONZALEZ IS MOVE THE BILL. I'M SEEING NO OTHER SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTS- WILL BRING IT BACK TO YOU- AUTHORED TO. ADD TOOK TO CLOSE I KNOW IT'S LATE BUT JUST. LET ME APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR. BECAUSE OF THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL BILL. THIS REALLY IS. CENTRALLY ABOUT FACILITATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LAW.

BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GO SOMEWHERE WITH THIS- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM WE DIDN'T DO NEED TO. DIVERSIFY CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY PORTFOLIO AND WE ARE REALLY GETTING THAT- SOLVE IN THE CLIMATE CRISIS RELATED TO CUT CLIMATE POLLUTION. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW- THE UNITED NATIONS SAID AS- RECENTLY AS THIS YEAR FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AT THE CURRENT LEVELS OF. CLIMATE POLLUTION ARE VERY VERY FAR FROM PUTTING US. ON ANY REAL PATHWAY TO MEET OUR PARIS AGREEMENT GOALS. LAST NIGHT'S SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT LAST AT LEAST GIVE ME SOME HOPE THAT WERE WERE WE'RE GONNA XCELERATED NATIONWIDE AND WE REALLY NEED.

WHERE CONSUMERS CAN AFFORD THEM SO WE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T PUT. OUR RATE PAYERS OUT OF BUSINESS IN AN ADVOCATING FOR CLIMATE POLICY I THINK THERE'S A BALANCE. WE HAVE TO FIND THAT RIGHT BALANCE AND IT'S VERY HARD TO DO AND UP TO NOW CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER. AT FINDING THAT BALANCE. AND IT'S ALWAYS A FIGHT HERE IN THE FLOOD LEGISLATURE CAN ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE GREEN ECONOMY AND FINDING A WAY TO. MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON RATEPAYERS AND TAXPAYERS. THAT AND IT'S VERY HARD THING TO DO SO WE REALLY LOOKED AT THIS BILL AS A MEANS OF TO ACCOMPLISH THAT AND- ATTRACTING INVESTMENT. TO CALIFORNIA IN THE MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ALSO- DIVERSIFYING OUR PORTFOLIO SO. I DID IN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE OF THE COMMITTEE AND STUFF AND THE CHAIR WORKING WITH US BECAUSE WE WEREN'T REALLY WANT TO GET A TO POSITION WHERE THIS PROGRAM. COULD TAKE OFF BECAUSE GREEN HYDROGEN IS THE GREENEST OF. OF THE- HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES IT ALSO. CAN HELP US- THE- TRANSITION FROM OTHER KIND OF FUELS INTO MORE RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE FUEL TO VERY EXCITING. INDUSTRY THAT WE CAN REALLY. DEVELOP HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN AND OUT AGAIN SEND IT TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD IN. CALIFORNIA COULD BE A LEADER REALLY ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE LIKE WE HAVE BEEN.

THANK YOU SO MUCH A PART OF- PERSONAL THANK YOU SENATOR HI HI I DO AND I WILL SAY I WANT TO THANK CENTER WAS SO CENTER SKINNER CENTER ARCHULETA FOR- YOU KNOW BRINGING UP. ALL OF THESE ISSUES RELATED TO HYDROGEN I REALLY IT MAKES ME THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE I TO HAVE- INFORMATIONAL HEARING AT SOME% POINT- VIA PERHAPS THIS YEAR ON THIS TOPIC BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GENERATE A LOT OF INTEREST AMONGST MEMBERS AND- I THINK AND WE'VE ALL BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF. A SMART PATH MOVING FORWARD ON THIS TOPIC. AND SO I THINK THE I THINK THAT OF THE CRUX OF THE CONCERN AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT WAS FROM THIS COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS. WAS THE MECHANISM OF DIRECT ALLOWANCE ALLOCATION BEING USED- I HAD A YOU KNOW- OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING A LOT THIS WEEK ABOUT GREEN HYDROGEN WHAT IT IS WHAT STANDARDS NEED TO BE APPLIED TO PRODUCING IT WHAT'S HOLDING IT BACK NOW WHAT ROLE TO PLAY IN CALIFORNIA THE LIST GOES ON AND ON WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT A FURTHER TODAY. ON VERY IMPORTANT NEW ONES CONVERSATIONS- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY LOOKING VERY MUCH FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE STAKEHOLDERS. DOT IN THERE IS COMMITTEE ON THIS TOPIC I'M I'VE WHEN I VERY MUCH WELCOME THE INPUT FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE AS WELL ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. SO I THINK THE STICKING POINT FOR US. HAS NOT BEEN GREEN HYDROGEN IT'S BEEN ON THE ALLOWANCE ALLOCATION- YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW. WE'VE WE'VE VERY BEEN VERY COMMITTED IS COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE GOALS OF SB THIRTY TWO IN CAP AND TRADE. AND YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT THE ORIGINAL SB TWO SB THIRTY TWO MACINNES AND AB THIRTY MECHANISM HAD- SOME DIRECTION AS OPPOSED IT WITH REGARDS TO ALLOWANCES. SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. BOB AND THE ACTIVE ALLOWANCES TO PRODUCERS AT DIRECTLY IS A DEPARTURE FROM HOW WE'VE DONE THINGS AND I THINK- YOU KNOW THE ISSUE OF COURSE IS. HOW DO WE BALANCE THE INCENTIVE POSITION OF USING OF TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE. AGREED HYDROGEN PRODUCTION EVEN TALKING ABOUT- SENATOR. WITH WITH OUR GOALS TO TRULY CAP EMISSIONS AND CHIEF CAP AND TRADE SCHOOLS AND GIVE THE AIRPORT THE- YOU KNOW THE KIND OF IMPROVE POWER THEM TO DO THE WORK THEY NEED TO DO TO. TO GET THERE. SO WE OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE THE BILL'S A WORK IN PROGRESS THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN WILLING TO WORK WITH US TO COMMIT SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. BOB SPECIFICALLY THE AUTHOR WILL BE AMENDING THE BILL TO INSTEAD OF- DIRECTING AIR BE TO CREATE THIS GREEN HYDROGEN CREDIT PROGRAM HAVE THEM FIRST CONSIDER IT MAKING A DETERMINATION THAT DOING SO WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK THE SPONSORS WERE- YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS IS BECAUSE- IT WOULD IT WOULD IT WOULD CREATE A- BY DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IT WOULD IT WOULD. IT WOULD- AREA FIFTY YEAR BE DOES DECIDE TO ADOPT THIS IT WOULD MAKE IT A FASTER PROCESS. THAN THAN THE LONG PROCESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH. THEIR ADOPTION NOW WITHOUT THIS BILL- BUT I CERTAINLY I THINK BY THE COMMITTEE ULTIMATELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE BE REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF CREATING A PROGRAM THAT WE GIVE THEM SPACE EITHER GO FORWARD WITH THAT OR NOT BASED ON THEIR- THEIR OWN JUDGMENT. SO ANYWAY WE FIGURE THIS PATH FOR THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS. SO WHILE UNFORTUNATELY ANALYSIS DOESN'T REFLECT. THESE CHANGES WE DO HAVE COPIES OF THE MARKUP THAT'S BEING SUBMITTED TO COUNCIL TO PASS AROUND I DO THINK- ONCE AGAIN I DO THINK IT WILL LAY- THE OPPOSITION CONCERN. THAT WE HEARD ON THE PHONE LINES. COTTON AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS- YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO'VE GOT NEUTRAL SO I DO APPRECIATE ONCE FLEXIBILITY AS WE CONTEMPLATE THESE- THESE CHANGES I LOOK FOR IT OR DISCUSSION TODAY AND ALSO WITH THE SKINNER BILL- AND WITH. THOSE COMMENTS LIKE TO OPEN THE FLOOR TO. QUESTIONS CONCERNS DISCUSSED FROM COMMITTEE. SENATE AND HOUSE. YES THANK YOU SENATOR WESSEL FOR BRINGING THIS WHERE I WAS ACTUALLY JUST TALKING TO MY CHIEF AS WELL ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE DO ABSOLUTELY NEED AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON HYDROGEN AND WOULD LOVE TO AND INCLUDE A LOT OF THAT- STAKEHOLDERS SO WE CAN HAVE A REALLY ROBUST DISCUSSION ON HOW TO I WAS JUST SAYING THAT I WAS JUST TALKING TO MY CHIEF ABOUT THAT SAME EXACT THING SOME ON THE SAME- SPACE MIND SPACES YOU- YOU KNOW. HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOW- SOMETHING THAT THE AIR IF YOU CAN CONSIDER- AND I KNOW THAT THEY WILL CERTAINLY I HOPE THAT THEY DO. FROM CONSIDER THIS- AS WELL AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY I KNOW IT'S IN HERE FOR JUST TO PUT ON RECORD BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE CALLERS HAD MENTIONED- DEFINING. GREEN HYDROGEN AS ELECTROLYTIC AND IT IS SO I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION THERE BUT- AS WELL MAKE SURE YOU. OKAY GREAT. THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL. I KNOW. OKAY. GREAT CENTERS CAN- YES THE A IN INFORMATIONAL HEARING WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY IN A PRECIPICE WE APPRECIATE I THINK WE ALL IN THE MOVING ALL THESE BILLS APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A REAL ROLE FOR HYDROGEN IN SO MANY ASPECTS OF. NOT ONLY OUR CLIMATE GOALS BUT ALSO OUR AIR QUALITY GOALS AND WE WANT TO GET IT RIGHT SO I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL OUT AND- GLAD THAT THE- COMMITTEE WORKED WITH YOU AND YOU TOOK THE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK WORK YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY- THERE'S- A AS- AS WE GIVE AGENCIES YOU KNOW IF. IF ALL THE DIFFERENT BILLS GET SIGNED OR YOU KNOW THEN AGENCIES ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR THEY'RE GOING TO DEVELOP BREAKS OBVIOUSLY AND WE GET IT'S GOOD FOR US NOT TO BE TOO OVER PRESCRIPTIVE PREZ. CLEARLY THE DAY WILL DO ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH IN SECTION ADD TO YOU KNOW OUR THINKING AND- HELP US GET IT RIGHT BUT I THINK AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING TO GREAT IDEA BUT ALSO SUPPORT THE BILL AND APPRECIATE AS I SAID. THE AUTHORS WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND TAKING. MEASUREMENTS THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU ARE SAY I HEARD A MOTION SENATE SKINNER. SAID IT WAS A HALF. FIVE FIVE SEVEN. WE'VE EVEN. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE CALL VERY SPUR OF COMMON AND JUST- GENERALLY DOES STATE THAT- I THINK THIS IS.

I THINK YOU'RE SEEING I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THIS THIS TOPIC IS GENERATING A LOT OF INTEREST FROM MEMBERS AND- IF I COULD JUST ADD JUST.

THANK THANKS VERY MUCH TO HEAR AND THINK YOU YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING ON AMENDMENTS BECAUSE WE ABSOLUTELY WE DO WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT AND SO THE- AMENDMENTS I'M ACCEPTING OR WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING OUT THE DEFINITION OF GREEN HYDROGEN AND THE CLARIFICATION OF OUR PS ELIGIBILITY OUT OF THE BILL SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH NOT ONLY STAKEHOLDERS BUT ALSO CLEARLY THE- OUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- THAT WE DO OUR BEST TO GET IT RIGHT I MEAN WE NOTE BOOK THERE'S- A THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT WE EVER WILL GET SOMETHING PERFECT HOWEVER WE'RE GONNA DO OUR BEST TO IMPROVE IT. AND SO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE MEASUREMENTS- THE VERY INTERESTING THING ABOUT HYDROGEN. HI- YOU KNOW I CAME INTO THE LEGISLATURE WHEN SCHWARZENEGGER WAS GOVERNOR AND HE WAS THE BIG ADVOCATE AND I AT THAT TIME. I MEAN THE INTERESTING THING IS HYDROGEN THE MOST BASIC AND MOST- IT'S AN ABOVE ONE OF THE MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENTS IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE SO. YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN HARNESS IT CORRECTLY YES YOU WANT TO USE IT HOWEVER. THAT THE POINT THAT GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER WAS ADVOCATING FOR HYDROGEN WE WERE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR THE PLACE WHERE WE COULD PRODUCE IT FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES. IN IN FACT THE HYDROGEN THAT WE'RE PRODUCING WAS EVEN MORE CARBON IN TESTS. BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY OF FOSSIL FUELS THAT WAS USED TO PRODUCE IT SO IN EFFECT IT WAS NOT A BENEFIT IT WAS A BENEFITTED FROM A TAIL PIPE IN TERMS OF. TAIL PIPE EMISSIONS BUT YOU YOU KNOW WAS NOT USEFUL FOR. MANY OF OUR GOALS HOWEVER. TECHNOLOGIES HAVE ADVANCED MORE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE AND WE ARE PRODUCING SO MUCH RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN AND THEN YOU IT'S A VERY FLEXIBLE BECAUSE IT CAN BE UTILIZED FOR FUEL OR UTILIZED FOR STORAGE ENERGY STORAGE ELECTRICITY STORAGE. OR UTILIZED IMAGE JUST HAS A LOT WHEN I SAY RENEWABLE ENERGY I. ALSO REFER REFERENCE THINGS LIKE WASTE THAT. OUR BIO GASSER ACQUISTARE FORCE WASTE THAT THOSE THINGS COULD ALSO BE PRODUCTIVELY USED TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN. ARMS AND MUCH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE WITHIN THE FOSSIL FUEL SYSTEM COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED FOR HYDROGEN WHICH WOULD HELP US RETAIN SOME OF THE JOBS IN THAT SECTOR AS WE MOVE OFF OF FOSSIL FUELS. SO WHILE THE BILL DOES NOT- GUARANTEE ANY THAT IT POSITIONS CALIFORNIA TO BEGIN PLANNING IN THAT WAY SO THAT WE CAN TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE AND IT SENDS A MARKET SIGNAL SO. IT VANCE'S GREEN HYDROGEN BY REQUIRING OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO START PLANNING FOR THIS. MAN TO- INCLUDED IN THE SCOPING PLAN AND IT CLARIFIES THAT GREEN ELECTRIC CHARGING SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE STATE'S PLANNING FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A STATUTORY DEFINITION FOR GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN. AND IT REQUIRES THE PC TO ADD GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN INTO ANY FUTURE STORAGE PROCUREMENT MANDATES AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT JANICE LAND. FROM THE GREEN HYDROGEN COALITION AND MARIAN BERGESON FROM IN OUR DC. THANK YOU MICHAEL SERVICES. THANK SENATORS THANK YOU CARE ALLEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS JANET PLAN AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE GREEN HYDROGEN COALITION WERE FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT MISSION IS TO ADVANCE GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION AND USE AT SCALE TO ACCELERATE MULTI SECTORAL DECARBONISATION. IN HYDROGEN GAME CHANGE ARE FIVE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE IT WILL ENABLE THE- OF HARD WOULD BE ACTORS THAT ARE NOT EASILY ELECTRIFY. AND MAINTAIN GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE STATE WE REALIZE THAT DEFINING GREEN HYDROGEN IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE'RE WORKING WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE THE RIGHT DEFINITION FOR GREEN HYDROGEN. THAT DOES NOT EXCLUDE TECHNOLOGY AND HER CLIMATE INTEGRITY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL FOR SENATE BILLIE JEAN AND THE PROVINCIAL CARE ACT ABOLITION INAPPROPRIATE VISION AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF GREEN HYDROGEN. NAMELY IT'S A GREAT WAY TO ELECTRIFY INTO CARBONITE THEIR FUEL SUPPLY WE CAN CONVERT ARE ABUNDANT LOW COST WIND AND SOLAR RESOURCES INTO A FLEXIBLE NERO CARBON FUEL THAT CAN DISPLACE. MANY POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS INCREASING RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY. SECOND RAINBIRD GREEN HYDROGEN WE CAN REPURPOSE VALUABLE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE CLING AFFORDABLE ENERGY TRANSITION. AND THEN EXAMPLE LED W. P. AS IN THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING LAST REMAINING COAL PLANT IN CENTRAL UTAH. COMBINED CYCLE TURBINE. AND FINALLY GREEN HYDROGEN IS A TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ANDJOB CREATION. OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA. GROWING GLOBALLY COME WITH LARGE EXPORT. ALREADY MANY COUNTRIES THE IRVINE TO BECOME THE LEAD GREEN PRODUCERS. INCLUDING ASSURE. SHE RANKS BEING FORTY ARABIA AND OTHER. GREEN HEIDI THE NEW OR HER GENERAL. WITH MEDICALLY. CALIFORNIA GET RID OF BY GLOBALLY. I RESPECTFULLY YOUR IDOL SB EIGHTEEN TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS CONTINUED GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IN THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. THANK YOU LET'S GO OVER TO MEMBERS AND. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ALAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S MERION VARGAS AND JUNIOR SCIENTIST WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL BEGIN TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTEEN. I'M SO THE CURRENT U. S. PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN- AND IT'S AT NEARLY AS MUCH CLIMATE POLLUTION AT ALL OF ILLINOIS POWER PLANTS COMBINE. ISSUED SOURCE OF POLLUTION IN BOTH THE U. S. WIDE AND GLOBALLY AND ENERGY CC SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR CLEANING UP EXISTING HYDROGEN PRODUCTION AS WELL AS NEW USES FOR HYDROGEN IT DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE SECTORS SUCH AS AVIATION. MARINE SHIPPING LONG DISTANCE TRUCKING AND HEAVY INDUSTRY. AND GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN MADE BY SPLITTING WATER USING RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING OPTIONS FOR LONG DURATION STORAGE OF POWER AND FOR MANAGING THE SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN THE APPEAL L. BELLAVIA FOR NEW ELECTRICITY FROM SOLAR AND WIND- BUT IMPORTANTLY HYDROGEN'S ABILITY TO PLAY A ROLE IN CLEANING UP THE CON YOU TRULY. ON ITS PRODUCTION I'M SO SORRY MERRY WE'RE WE'RE MUCH WE'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST THAT THE TIME FOR THE FOR TESTIMONY PROSECUTORS WANT. TO FINISH YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR POINT. I'M SORRY. SHORT YET BUT WE STRONGLY THE APPROACH AND ASK EIGHTEEN I'M AN IT'S REALLY HAVING CAR. AND DEVELOP THIS PLAN. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE- AND PATHWAY. FOR FORM HYDROGEN. WE APPRECIATE THIS AMOUNT LOOKING THE COST AND BY ISSUE HEALTH AND- OF THE VERY. WHICH WILL HELP ELIMINATE THE PATH FOR. I'M SO WITH THAT I WILL. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB EIGHTEEN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SEE THAT OKAY BUT I SEE SOMEONE HERE IN PERSON. WHILE I LOVE IT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER SERVICE AND THEY'LL SEND FOR THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN BUSINESS COUNCIL WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTEEN BECAUSE IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO EXPAND DECARBONISATION ENSURING OF OUR MENTAL INTEGRITY AND SPUR INVESTMENT BY UTILIZING A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL SCIENCE BASED APPROACH TO ACCURATELY QUANTIFY CARBON EMISSIONS FROM ALL SOURCES OF HYDROGEN. WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE CENTER SKINNER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTES THANK YOU FOR YOU CENTER THE SAVINGS THANK.

AT THE FINE REMINDER PLEASE PROPOSAL ZERO TO UP. TO S. B. EIGHTEEN. STRUCTURE NOBODY ELSE'S QUEUING UP DIRTY SO MUCH WILL BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION I DO BELIEVE THAT- SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED- I AND I AND I KNOW THAT THE TO THE CENTERS VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING HARD TO.

DALY AYE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I SKINNER ALL RIGHT SKINNER AYE STERN. STERN AYE STERN AYE WIECKOWSKI. PART FOR ALL THE ROLE OPEN AND I WANT TO WELCOME OUR FRIENDS INSTEAD TO BACK IN- THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT OVER THERE AND YOU'RE GONNA BE OVER HERE. PLUS WE WELCOME UNIVERSITY CHIU AND- HOPEFULLY CINEMATOGRAFIA MAKE IT OVER SOON TOO SO LET'S GO TO YOU SENATE DOLLY TO PRESENT AS BEFORE NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING. FIVE I'VE SAT ON NOT TO RESOURCES IN THE ASSEMBLY I SAT ON EQ. IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I WAS THEIR FOR THEIR SPUR SCOPING PERIOD OF- WITH- MEETING WITH MARY NICHOLS WITH SENATOR HUESO SENATOR- CHESBRO AND MYSELF AND I ASKED FOR. ARE WE DON'T WE CALCULATE OR WE ACCESS WHAT THE IMPACTS OF CARBON ARE FROM WILDFIRE IN THE ANSWER WAS THAT IT WAS JUST IT'S A NATURAL OCCURRENCE AND WE REALLY- AND IT SO HAPPENED THEY AND THEY HAVEN'T. COUNTED CARBON OR EVEN ASSESSED HOW MUCH CARBON RELEASING DUE TO WILDFIRE. SO HOUSE FORWARD. IF YOU YEARS AND WE DID SB NINE OH ONE IN SB NINE ON WE AFFECTS BE TESTING ON A ONE WE ACTUALLY PUT LANGUAGE IN THAT BILL. THE SAID. TWO A. R. B. YOU WILL ASSESS THE MOUNT OF CARBON THAT IS RELEASED FROM FOREST FIRE. THAT MIND YOU. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN OUR ECOSYSTEM BEFORE WE SETTLED HERE IN THE SEEK IT BEFORE WE SETTLED FIRE NATURALLY BURNED IN CALIFORNIA. OUR LANDSCAPES IN MOST PLACES EVERY TEN YEARS IN SOME PLACES MORE OFTEN IN SOME PLACES NOT SO OFTEN. BUT WHAT DID THAT DO THE FIRE BASICALLY FIT AND ARE FOR OUR FORCE LANDS IN OUR BRUSH LANDS AND GAVE US A ECOSYSTEM THAT WAS BALANCED. WE CAME ALONG AND WHAT DID WE DO WE SUPPRESSED FIRE FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS NOW SO. ARE FORCED AND OUR OUR RANGELANDS ARE NOT IN THE SAME. PLACE THEY WERE BEFORE WE CAME ALONG AND SETTLED THIS LAND IS STARTED MANAGER LANCE. SO THE ECOSYSTEM IS OUT OF BALANCE AND QUITE FRANKLY. WE'VE SEEN CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE SO DEVASTATING THAT THIS IS BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH FUEL OUT THERE AND WHAT AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE HAVE ALL THIS FUEL LOAD. WE HAVE TOO MANY TREES PER ACRE IN AND. THE CASCADES THE TRINITY ALPS THE COASTLINES PARKS CARBON SEQUESTERS WE ALL LEARNED IN FIFTH GRADE THAT WHEN WE BREATHE OUT CARBON MONOXIDE. THE TREES BREATHE IT IN AND THEY FILTER IT IS THE BIGGEST FILTER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS IMPAIRED AND I AM SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED I I'VE READ THE ANALYSIS ON THIS. ON THIS BILL AND YOU KNOW NOBODY WANTS TO TACKLE THE BIG ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE HAVE TOO MANY TREES PER ACRE. WHEN THE SNOW ACTUALLY FALLS. IT DOESN'T TOUCH THE GROUND BECAUSE IT LANDS ON THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES. AND THAT CAUSES A DAPPER TRANSPIRATION. THAT MEANS WHEN THE WIND BLOWS IT EVAPORATES AND IT GOES AWAY IT DOESN'T LAND ON THE FOURTH FLOOR BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK. IN WE'VE SEEN CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE WE'VE LOST MILLIONS OF ACRES. IANS. FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH LAND THAT IS AND HOW WHAT DEVASTATING YEARS AND WE DON'T COUNT THE CARBON WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE CAR NO WE REGULATE. CARBON THAT COMES FROM. DIESEL TRUCKS AGRICULTURE EQUIPMENT BOATS SHIPS TRAINS AND WE TRY TO MANAGE THE SYSTEM BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY IMPACTING THE ENVIRONMENT BLACK CARBON IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEVASTATION FROM FIRE IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO THE SCOPING PLAN THIS BILL THIS BILL DOES NOT ASK FOR ANY MONEY FROM G. R. F. FUNDS. I STRIPPED IT ALL OUT. THIS BILL SIMPLY PASSED THE A. R. B. TO CALCULATE EMISSIONS FROM FIRE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME. I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING AND I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS IF YOU COME TO THE FOREST AND LET THE FORCE TALK TO YOU AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS OUT THERE. THERE'S NO WAY AS SOMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT CANNOT. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM THAT NOBODY. SEEMS TO. TWO ONE ADDRESS. SO I GET OPPOSITION I MEAN I MAYBE IT'S JUST THE NAME ON THE BILL I GET OPPOSITION FROM THE SIERRA CLUB ON ALMOST EVERY SINGLE BILL I RUN HERE I'VE INVITED THEM TO COME OUT AND LOOK AT THE FOREST WITH ME IN THE IN THE- IN THE- LANDS THAT. ARE IMPAIRED I'VE TRIED IT A GRAND MANY BILLS IN THE AREA OF DOING STREAMLINING. REGULATIONS SO WE CAN ACTUALLY. GO OUT AND THEN THE FOR SO WE CAN ALLOW FIRE TO DO IT NATURALLY DID WHICH WAS BURNED. IN A LOW INTENSE MOSAE QUA. TWO MEMBERS. I KNOW I GOT OPPOSITION I KNOW THIS BILL IS TOUGH. AND I KNOW I PROBABLY WON'T GET TO SPELL OUT HERE. BUT I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT JUST. IT IS VERY RIGHTEOUS. IN I CONSIDER MYSELF AN ENVIRONMENTALIST. I TOOK BY TILL THE LUNATIC CARE LAID. IN THIS FORCES ARLENA AND OUR WATERSHEDS AND OUR WILDLIFE ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE WE DON'T ADDRESS IT IN THE RIGHT WAY I JUST SIMPLY WANT TO. PUSH THE POINT THAT. WE ARE RELEASING CARBON. MILLIONS OF TIMES AND I CAN PULL OUT OF THE NOW SAYS THAT IT'S IN THERE IF YOU READ IT HOW MANY METRIC MILLION TONNES WAS HE MADE IT JUST IN THE LAST CYCLE. SO I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. I KNOW IT'S TOUGH AND IF YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS IF YOU HAVE. MORE DATA THAN I CAN THAT ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME TO ANSWER I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER THOSE BILLS FOR THOSE QUESTIONS SO I CAN EXPLAIN. THE FLAWED ANALYSIS I GOT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YES TREES LIMBS FALL TO THE GROUND AND THEY BECOME SOME OF IT COMES BE PETRIFIED WOOD THAT'S STORED CARBON FOREVER THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT WE HAVE TO GET ARE FORCED BACK INTO SHAPE AND WE CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM THERE WITH CARBON OUTPUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR YOU CENTER. THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS- LET'S LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES- IF ANYONE WANTS TO. PLEASE OPPOSITION SORRY BUT WE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. WE DON'T HAVE RICHER WITNESSES ON EITHER SIDE. THE SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR- I THINK WE'RE ON AS BEFORE NINETY FIVE IS THAT CORRECT YEAH THIS IS FOR NINETY FIVE MOTOR. THANK YOU AND TO SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS. ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR NOBODY'S QUEUING UP EVERYONE IN OPPOSITION. CHAU OPPOSITION FOR- AS BEFORE NINE FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. AND AGAIN I NOBODY IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME SIR OKAY PART. OKAY SO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE LOOK I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST START BY SAYING AND- MY APPRECIATION FOR THE FOR THE AUTHOR- AND HE'S- ALWAYS COMMITTED APPROACH TO I'M ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS AND REALLY ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS OF OUR ENTIRE. APPROACH TO BIG PROBLEMS OF. OF ALL SORTS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF WILDFIRE AND I'M I'M PERSONALLY VERY HAPPY TO GO TO WITH YOU DID TO THE FOREST AND- KIND OF WALK WALK A MILE IN YOUR SHOES UP THERE- YOU KNOW THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE'RE LOSING OUR GROUND THAT WE'RE LOSING GROUND AND- IN OUR EFFORT TO COMBAT. CLIMATE CHANGE WHERE WE'RE WE'RE HAVING EVER MORE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES I JUST YESTERDAY I WAS ON A CALL WITH A BUNCH OF USC STUDENTS HAVE BEEN HELPING ME THINK ABOUT WHAT FAR CHALLENGES- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL I MEAN IT I THINK FOR A LONG TIME WE JUST. KIND OF WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS THIS WITH FIRE. CHALLENGE THIS LIABILITY THIS THIS DANGER. IS VULNERABILITY- BUT IT WAS THE KIND OF THING WOULD HAPPEN OCCASIONALLY AND NOW IT'S JUST BECOME A KIND OF AN ANNUAL OCCURRENCE THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS BUT MY NECK OF THE WOODS IN THE BAY AREA- IN HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I WE GOT LIGHTS FLICKERING OUT IN THE MIDDLE TODAY BECAUSE THE SMOKE FROM THE WILDFIRES HAS GOT TO BE SO INTENSE IN THE IN THE SMOKE THE WORLD READING IS GOING TO BE SO INTENSE AND SO. IT'S- IT'S AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WE'RE JUST NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT I MEAN WE KNOW I THINK IT'S TAKING TOO LONG- BUT OBVIOUSLY WE JUST PASSED A MAJOR- BONFIRE PACKAGE. ARE FOR FUNDING TO ADDRESS- WILL BE A WILDFIRE MITIGATION THIS IS OF COURSE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BOND DISCUSSION WITH SB FIFTY FOUR. THERE'S A LOT IN THERE ABOUT WILDFIRES- AND JUST A LOT OF CONFERS OUR COMMITMENT EVEN THIS LATEST PACKAGE AND WE DID I THINK IT'S JUST THE START OF WHAT IS IT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE MORE AND MORE. RESOURCE AND ATTENTION AND TIME GIVEN BY THE EVERYONE FROM THE GOVERNOR TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE TOP AGENCIES. TO START DEALING WITH THIS ENORMOUS PROBLEM- THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY. RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT AND POINT OUT. AND THEN THEY TRY TO JUST FOCUS ON. MY ISSUE AND I THINK OUR COMMITTEE ISSUE WITH THE BILL I REALLY HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE APPROACH. OF MUSIC THE D. V. THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN. PARSE OUT THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NATURAL CARBON CYCLES AND HUMAN ACTIVITY IN GHG EMISSIONS RESULTING FROM NATURAL LANDS AND I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO COME UP FOR US IS HOW HOW WE CAN CALL FOR AN ADMIN FOR THE PLAN FOR- GHG REDUCTIONS FROM NATURAL PROCESSES IN THE SCOPING PLAN BEFORE WE KNOW HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN IT NATURAL PROCESS HE'S- AND THOSE EMITTING CARBON AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ACTIVITY WE MAY KNOW WHAT IGNITES A FIRE FOR EXAMPLE BUT WE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE DETERMINE HOW MUCH THC FROM ANY GIVEN FIRES NATURAL AND TO BE EXPECTED. WHAT IS THE NORMAL BASELINE WE DEVIATED FROM- OBVIOUSLY WILDFIRES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A AN EMITTER- FROM LONG BEFORE. YOU KNOW THE YEAR OF THE- THE SPANISH- SO AND INTO ACCEPT IT IS A FREE THERE IS A NATURAL PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH FIRE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ECOSYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA- OF COURSE YOU KNOW. YOU POINT OUT EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THAT HUMAN. INTERACTION HUMAN ENGAGEMENT OUR TRANSMISSION LINES THAT THAT THE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT WE HAVE HAVE EXACERBATED THE SITUATION. AMP AND PUT IT IN A PLACE WHERE NOW WE REALLY HAVE TO START TO GRAPPLE WITH WILDFIRES AS HUMAN CAUSED- POLLUTER AND IN ADDITION TO. NO PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT. SO NOW. OF COURSE WELFARE SEVERITY VARIES FROM FROM YEAR TO YEAR- ANDERSON QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE PLAN FOR EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM FIRE WE CAN ANTICIPATE HOUSE OF YOUR SEASON WILL BE. IS REMEMBERED SENIOR TO MORE MORE SEVERE- WE KNEW WE KNOW THAT LIMITING OFF I WAS NOT THE CORRECT FORCE MANAGEMENT APPROACH- BUT WITHOUT KNOWING INAPPROPRIATE WILDFIRE EMISSIONS BASELINE WITH. WITH STATUTORY. DIRECTION TO MAXIMALLY REDUCE EMISSIONS- THAT COULD BE JUST FOR BACK TO DOING. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE STUDYING THIS ISSUE IS A BETTER APPROACH IT ALLOWS US TO FIGURE BEFORE POTENTIALLY SETTING BACK OUR CLIMATE GOALS WRIT LARGE. NOTS ON OF COURSE ANOTHER HUGE PART OF THIS EFFORT WE KNOW WITH PART OF CALIFORNIANS- THE THOUGHT PROCESS HERE IS THAT WE DO WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER. I KNOW IN IN IN IN IN FOCUSING ON EMISSIONS REDUCTION IN THOSE AREAS THAT- THERE REALLY ARE ENTIRELY- AND- HUMAN CAUSED- YOU KNOW I GUESS I GUESS YOU SAID SB THIRTY TWO REQUIRES CALIFORNIA TO GET 40% NINETY NINETY. EMISSION LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE THE QUESTION IS WHAT SHOULD OUR WILDFIRE EMISSIONS BE 40% LOWER THAN THEY WERE NINETEEN NINETY. IS THAT IS THAT SAYS THAT HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS. SO I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE AUTHOR'S INTENT I AGREE WE NEED TO TAKE AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY AND PREVALENCE OF WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE. I'M A JOINT AUTHOR OF THE SENATE'S CLIMB IN WILDFIRE BOND OUT SB FORTY FIVE I WAS VERY. SUPPORTIVE OF THE WELFARE PACKAGE I'M ON THE WELFARE TEAM. I'M VERY INTERESTED IN IN IN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR- ARE YOU KNOW ON ON ON HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE. IT'S NOT JUST CONTINUE TO BUT REALLY. CHINA GREATER SPOTLIGHT ON THE CHALLENGES AND NEEDS- BOTH BOTH FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AND A FORCE MEASURE PERSPECTIVE ALSO DECLARED PERSPECTIVE. WHEN IT COMES TO- TO ADDRESSING OFFERS I JUST DON'T PERSONALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THIS. PARTICULAR APPROACH- BUT I DO WANNA SAY HI I DO SINCERELY APPRECIATE. THE AUTHOR'S. SINCERITY HONESTY AND A COMMITMENT TO. TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE- AT YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T I'M NOT COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THIS PARTICULAR PRICE TODAY- BUT CERTAINLY WANT TO WORK WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW IF HE HAS THE VOTES YES VOTES BUT- I STILL WANT TO WORK IN THE FUTURE- ON THIS ON WHAT IS AN UNDENIABLE. UNDENIABLE MAJOR CHALLENGE THAT OUR STATE FACES. AND DONE SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR TO QUESTIONS COMMENTS DISCUSSION FROM THE MEMBER SAYS THIS AMERICAN DOLLARS. S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY I UNDERSTAND I KNOW YOU'VE BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP AS WELL AND I- I HAD. THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN I FIRST GOT IN IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO GO SENATOR NIELSEN UP TO PARADISE TO SEE HIS COMMUNITY AND SO I UNDERSTAND. THE AND I'VE SEEN IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND FULLY BUT- I'VE SEEN IT- DIRECTLY AND IT'S- SOMETHING THAT I KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON AND WE WANT TO HELP YOU WITH SINCERELY I THINK I'M WITH THE CHAIR AND THAT. IT IT IS THE APPROACH FOR ME AS WELL- AND THE LAST PORTION OF THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS EMAIL KIND OF STATES IT ALL KIND OF WRAPS IT UP IN IN TERMS OF. A STUDY TO INVESTIGATE AND PROJECT HUMAN BECAUSE VIRGIN VERSUS NATURALLY BECAUSE I WANT TO CONTINUE TO. BELABOR THE POINT BUT- I THINK WE NEED TO START THEIR FIRST IN ORDER TO. GET SOME UNDERSTANDING ON ON WHERE WE NEED TO PAY THAT FROM FROM HERE SO. WITH THAT I'LL BE LAYING OFF TODAY- BUT- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH YOU ON. THIS SINCERELY AS WELL THANK YOU. FORTY THE RECORD. FIVE BY A BE DOWN HOUSING- I'M JUST CURIOUS FROM THE AUTHORS BECAUSE I THINK IT HEARING YOU MAY HAVE SAID IT. WHY I MEAN I THOUGHT THE ANALYSIS WAS VERY COMPELLING WHAT MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT TAKING THE COMMITTEES- AMENDMENTS. WELL I DID SOMEWHAT MAYBE ADJUSTED IN MY OPENING REMARKS SO I WAS I ASKED FIVE YEARS AGO ONE SENATOR CHESBRO WAS THE CHAIR OF NATURAL SOURCES AND I WAS THE VICE CHAIR THAT WE DO WE SCOPED IT PETITIONS COPING PLAN FOR A R. B. NEVER HAPPENED. I ACTUALLY WAS VERY KEY IN SB NINE OH ONE WHEN I WAS IN THE SIMPLY SIDE IT WAS ACTUALLY REPUBLICAN LEADER AND I'M AND JUST SENATOR WILL- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD NOT HELD OUT UNTIL WE GOT THE LANGUAGE PUT IN. THAT BILL TO ACTUALLY DO IT- IT HAS A IT'S IN THERE BUT IT'S A IT'S A- IT'S NOT QUANTIFYING JUST FIRE. SO THEY DON'T DO THE REPORT I GOT BACK IS A CONVOLUTED REPORT IT TALKS ABOUT. I WANTED. SO BASICALLY I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON THE SIDE I THINK IT'S A RIGHTEOUS THING TO DO I THINK WE SHOULD. COUNT FOR I'M NOT ASKING US TO FIND SOMETHING I'M NOT ASKING FOR US TO. TO TAKE ANY R. G. G. R. F. FUNDS I STRIPPED ALL THAT ALL THE BILL. DO I THINK WE SHOULD SPEND MORE RESOURCE ARE ABSOLUTELY AND WE DIDN'T GET THAT DONE WE DID DO THAT AND I DON'T WANT WE PUT RESOURCES IN THERE. BUT SIMPLY THE FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HUMAN BECAUSE. AND NATURAL. YOU'VE I KNOW THAT. SENATOR ALAN CENTER SKINNER HAVE BEEN ON THE FORESTRY TOURISM BEEN OUT THERE TO SEE. ON THE GROUND AND I KNOW THAT SUNDERLAND GONZALEZ IS HOPEFULLY COMING WITH ME SOON- WE CAUSE THE PROBLEM THAT'S THE POINT WE TALK ABOUT HUMAN BECAUSE YES THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF IGNITION THAT HAPPENED BY HUMANS WHICH IS EITHER TRANSMISSION LINES OR- VEHICLES OR ARSON. BUT THE RESOURCE ITSELF IS BEING MANIPULATED FOR OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS BY MAN. IT'S NOT IN ITS NATURAL STATE. SO WHEN WE WANT TO IF WE WANT TO HAVE THE DEBATE ABOUT. WHAT THE RESORT WHAT HOW MUCH EMISSIONS ARE GONNA COME UPWHAT WOULD BE NATURALLY STORED WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS THAT BASS LINE WHICH I THINK WHAT CENTER ALAN'S TALK ABOUT THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO A STUDY. HE YOU WE ASKED THEM TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY GAVE ME IF YOU LOOK AT THE REPORT TO COME FROM. A. R. B. IT'S PRETTY BENIGN AND PARTY GENERAL AND NOT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT WHAT THE- HUMAN CALL HUMAN. INTERACTION WITH THE- LAND HAS BEEN SO. THE REASON FOR THIS BILL IS TO SAY THAT WE PUT IN THIS POSITION. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT NOT I'M NOT DENYING THAT. THE CLIMATE'S WARMING. BUT WEEK WE CAUSED. THE TO MEET THERE'S TOO MANY. TOO MUCH FUEL. WHETHER IT'S IN TREES OR BRUSH THERE'S TOO MUCH FEELS AND WE NEED TO PUT IT BACK IN THE STATE WORK FIRE CAN ACTUALLY GO INTO THE- LANDSCAPE. AND BE LEFT ALONE AND DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH IS. MOSAE CLEBURNE TO THE FOREST AND WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF DATA. THAT SHOWS US WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE WE MESSED WITH IT. BEFORE WE EITHER CUT IT DOWN AND LET IT GROW BACK AND THEN STOPPED ALL THE FIRE OR WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST BUT I CAN TELL YOU. WHAT DID HAPPEN IN THE PAST WAS WE'VE MANIPULATED SO. THAT'S THE REASON BEHIND THIS BILL IS TO JUST GET THAT QUANTITY. TO TALK ABOUT HATE LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING. ON FIRE. AND SKEWS ME I RAN A BILL TO DO. THE ANALYSIS FOR CREEK FOR WILDLIFE. THAT BILLS ACTUALLY WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS WHICH I KNOW WHAT A PROBABLY GET HELD UP. IN APPROACH BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME MONEY BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW. WHAT THE KNOWLEDGE THIS SO IT'S I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS WATERSHED. CARBON APPROACH TO WILDLIFE TO OUR TO OUR WATER SEQUESTRATION IN THE FOREST AND TO THE CARBON OUTPUT SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE THREE THE THREE LEGS OF WHAT I THINK SHOULD HAPPEN WE CAN WE DEBATE ALL DAY LONG ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD SPEND THE MONEY IN WHERE WE- WERE OR THE RIGHT PLACES ARE. BUT I THINK IT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MY PHILOSOPHY AND SOME OTHERS IS HOW WE GET THERE. WEEK WE CAN REGULATE THE HECK OUT OF. INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE GOT WE HAVE A SOURCE WE KNOW RIGHT WORDS COMING FROM AND WE KNOW THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN. CARBON OUT OF THE GROUND AND WERE MEDICARE. DEBATE BUT IN THIS CASE WE'VE STORED MORE CARBON IN OUR HAVING MASSEY RELEASES OF IT. SO HOW DO WE GET HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MANAGE THAT IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE MASSIVE RELEASES. AND WE ACTUALLY GO IN AND DO THE RIGHT TO HATE WHICH IS STILL IN THE DARK FORCED. AND THEN LET FIRE DO WHAT IT DOES AND I RAN I I'VE CHAMPION BILL AFTER BILL TO TRY TO GET THERE AND I ALWAYS HAVE OPPOSITION FROM THIS PERSON THAT DOESN'T WANT TO CUT A TREE AND THAT PERSON THAT. IS LIKE. THE LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION IS VERY HIGH AS YOU CAN SEE SO I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. THE ONLY THING THAT I WAS REALLY AND I KNOW I APPRECIATE- YOUR EXPLANATION I JUST WAS TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND WHY. YOU KNOW IT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT. THE WHILE THE AMENDMENTS DID NOT ACHIEVE ALL OF YOUR GOALS. THAT IT DID MOVE THE BALL FORWARD AND DID. WOULD PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME OF THE INFORMATION YOU WANTED NOT PERHAPS IN THE WAY YOU. THE WAY YOU HAD HOPED. BUT THAT'S WHY I WONDERED IF YOU WHY. YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO TAKE ALL THE COMMITTEES MINUTES BECAUSE I COULD SUPPORT THE BILL. WITH THE COMMITTEE'S MINUTES. YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. IT'S KIND OF LIKE SENATOR HUESO WAS BUILT WAS KIND OF THIS IN THE AME SITUATION IF YOU WATER MY BILL DOWN TO OR I DOESN'T DO WHAT I WANT TO GET IT DONE AND I MUSCLE. YOU KNOW DO A BETTER JOB OF EDUCATING I GUESS I WOULD BUY WILL BUY WE HAPPY TO SHOW SHARE WITH THE WHOLE COMMITTEE WHAT THE A. R. B. PUTS OUT RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS WHAT THEY CONSIDER- THERE'S THERE SCOPING PLAN AND IF YOU READ IT. I HOPE YOU JUST AS JUST AS JUST AS DISAPPOINTED AS I AM AND THE RESULTS WERE GETTING. SO ANYWAY. MISTER SINISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY FOR YOUR OF YOUR CONSISTENT PASSION ADD BECAUSE HERE OF I'VE BEEN THROUGH- THESE DIALOGUES WITH YOU PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY FOR YEARS NOW- I IT MIGHT MY CONCERN IS THAT IT FEEBLE CATION IS THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE IGNORING- THE CARBON INTENSITY OF WILDFIRES AND THAT THAT'S- THAT'S THE- PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL HERE. THANK THE INSISTENCE ON TRYING TO ADD TO IT. EMISSIONS TO THE SCOPING PLAN ITSELF. WHICH IS ABOUT ANTHROPOGENIC HUMAN CAUSED EMISSIONS FOR WHICH WE HAVE A NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY IN A REGULATORY COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK. WHERE CARS AND TRUCKS IN POWER PLANTS AND FACTORIES ARE ACTUALLY REGULATED FOR THOSE EMISSIONS IN THE SCOPING PLAN. TO PUT A TREE. AND SAY THAT WE HAVE TO NOW REGULATED TREE. LIKE WE REGULATE CARS. IS I THINK YOU MIGHT EVEN ADMIT SEEMS LIKE AN AWKWARD FIT SO YOU KNOW IF WE WERE GOING TO ADD THESE NON ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES THESE SORT OF NATURAL THESE NATURE BASED SOURCES. TO OUR SCOPING PLAN. SAY IT'S ABOUT DOUBLE THE EMISSIONS OF WHAT WE'VE GOT IN THERE RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN NOW JUST REDUCE THE COMPLIANCE BURDEN ON THE REST OF THE STATE BY HALF SO YOU'VE TOLD CONTROL IN WHICH IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF EMISSIONS IN THE STATE YOU KNOW IT. AFTER OBLIGATION HALF LET'S NOT WORRY BOUT PETROLEUM WE CAN HIT THE 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS JUST BY ADDING THIS FOREST CARBON IN AND DOING SOME FORCE MANAGEMENT. IF THERE'S A WAY TO BUILD THESE EMISSIONS IN SO THAT YOU'RE NOT LETTING EVERYONE ELSE OFF THE HOOK FOR A VERY CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT AROUND. OUR CLIMATE POLICIES IN THE STATE THAT WAS NEGOTIABLE I PARTISAN BASIS AND AS A HUGE INDUSTRY BEHIND IT. AND IT'S A IT'S A LOT TO JUST THROW IN THE WHOLE SOURCE THAT. ISN'T AGAIN IS A NATURE BASED SOURCE. THAT'S THE CAN. COURT HERE I THINK IF YOU HAD TO EITHER. A REQUIREMENT TO INCREASE THE ACTUAL EMISSIONS TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY. WHICH I KNOW YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR OUR OUR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HAVE DONE THAT SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO- BUT THAT THAT 80% TARGET WOULD ALLOW FOR SPACE FOR THIS KIND OF FORCED REDUCE CARBON OR IF WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE TO GO MORE SENATOR SKINNER'S ROUTE AND HURT SB TWENTY SEVEN WHERE SHE'S ALSO TRYING TO GET. AN ACCURATE INVENTORY AND REALLY GET THE MATH DONE BEHIND NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS BUT NOT TRYING TO TREAT THAT AS A MARKET BASED COMPLIANCE MECHANISM FOR THE REST OF THE MANMADE EMISSIONS. THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE CONCERN THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN LONG BEACH ON THE SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR OR WHO WERE SUFFERING FROM POLLUTION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE SUDDENLY GOING TO HAVE TO SEVER JUST AS MUCH IF NOT MORE POLLUTION BECAUSE- WE STARTED COUNTING FORCE AND THAT OFFSETS ALL THAT OTHER POLLUTION. SO I THINK I MIGHT BE YOU KNOW IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE TO ADD THAT KIND OF AMENDMENT OF AN 80% TARGET TO YOUR BILL OR TO TRY TO TAKE THESE EMISSIONS AND PUT THEM WHERE I THINK THEY BELONG WHICH IS IN A- COURT A NATURAL WORKING LANDS FRAMEWORK THE RESOURCE AGENCY COULD LOOK AT. IF. YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT- I THINK WE WERE COULD SOMETHING HERE AND MAYBE NOT TODAY BUT MAYBE THIS SESSION TO PUT THAT ALL TOGETHER BUT- IT'S TOO NARROW TO SIMPLY SAY NO NO WE'RE TRYING TO IGNORE. THOSE EMISSIONS- AND YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS A. R. B. A. R. B. IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE CHALLENGE WE SET BEFORE THEM WHICH IS TO GET 240% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY. OF ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WANNA DOUBLE THAT THE LET'S DOUBLE OUR COMMITMENT. SO I'M UP FOR IF YOU WANT TO ADD THAT TO THE BILL I'D BE GLAD TO SUPPORT IT OR TO TAKE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT THAT BUT I. I THINK WE'VE GOT TO JUST HAVE AN APPLES TO APPLES KIND OF CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL THIS YEAR. I'D LOVE TO RESPOND TO THAT. PERSONALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL. ANALYSIS BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE COMMENT. THE CLIMATE DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU BRING THE- CARBON OUT OF THE GROUND OR YOU MINUTES SOMEWHERE IT DOESN'T MATTER AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU STILL HAVE A CALL USED TO HAVE A CARBON PROBLEM. WHETHER YOU WHETHER YOU HAVE A SOURCE FOR FUNDING OR NOT OR SORCERY WANNA LET SOMEBODY OFF THE HOOK OR NOT IT ENDED TODAY HI I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY- INTERESTING THAT TO THE EPA DIRECTOR SAID HE WAS WITH THE GOVERNOR IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE SKY WAS ORANGE IT WASN'T FROM CARS. IT WAS FROM THE FORCED BURNING THE HECK DOWN SO LOOK I'M I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO GET THIS BILL OUT HERE TODAY BUT I CHALLENGES. BY CHALLENGES EVERY MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE. TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE IF YOU TRULY CARE ABOUT THE DARN CLIMATE. CAN YOU REALLY WATCH OUR WATERSHEDS GET DESTROYED. CAN WE REALLY IT'S BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION THAT WE FOCUS ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE. AND THERE'S THIS THERE'S THIS GIANT OUTPUT IT'S LIKE FOR ME IT'S LIKE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND AS I SAID EARLIER I'VE TRIED ALL AYE BRAND BUILT TO TRY TO. CORRECT THE REGULATE REGULATORY PROCESSES. IN THE FORCE TO GET US TO DO IT. ON ON WITH ITS OWN- PAYMENT SCHEDULE BUT I JUST WOULD SAY THAT IN AND THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO ADD IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT AT THE TABLE. WHICH IS VERY FRUSTRATING THEY HAVE 60% OF THE OF THE LAND MASS IN CALIFORNIA IS OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS OUR WATERSHED. ARE WILDLIFE. AND WE DON'T WE DON'T WE ARE NOT THE TABLE AT ALL AND YOU KNOW. I WENT OFF ON TRUMP'S SITTING WHEN HE SAID YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEMS ARE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA DOESN'T DO THE RIGHT THING INFO AND TRY TO BLAME GOVERNOR NEWSOM NOW. BUDDY YOU REPRESENT 60% OF IT AND YOU'RE NOT MANAGING YOUR LAND AT ALL AND IT'S DISGUSTING. WELL WE'RE WE'RE HOPING- THAT THE FEDERAL WILL COME TO THE TABLE- SO I WILL TELL TRY TO MOVE BASIC TENER BATES. WE'LL TAKE THAT AS CLOTHES APPRECIATE- I KNOW AND I SAY CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF PARTNERSHIP WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE- SO BECAUSE OF HIS COLOR. HELLO ITEM NUMBER NINE S. B. FOUR NINE FIVE BY SENATOR DOLLY THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE ALLEN. ALLEN BATES RIGHT BATES I'D DALLY DALLY I GONZALEZ. SKINNER. STERN YOU'RE NOT VOTING OR NOT VOTING BY CAL SKI. OKAY WILL CLOSER ON THAT TIME THANK YOU OKAY LET'S GO TO YOU CENTER STERN NOW TO PRESENT YOUR BILL THIS IS OUR LAST BILL ON THE AGENDA. YOU MAY PERCEIVE AN RARE NUMBERS I'LL TRY TO BE AS BRIEF AS I CAN HERE WE'RE WE'RE BACK ON THE TOPIC OF CLIMATE CHANGE- AND TRY TO TAKE AN HONEST LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL RISK. THAT CLIMATE IMPACTS NOT JUST THE WILD FIRES WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING BUT- THE OVERALL IMPACTS IN THE STATE ARE ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE AND ACCOUNTED FOR- BY OUR MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS- THERE BEEN EFFORTS BOTH IT. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS AT THE SEC- UNDER WAY IN THE NEW BY NAY MINISTRATION. TO PUSH OUR LARGEST FINANCIAL-INSTITUTIONS TO START DISCLOSING- THE FINANCIAL RISKS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE. I THINK THAT. WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND WE NEED THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS OUR PARTNERS IN THIS BATTLE BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY- THE PUBLIC DINING AND PUBLIC DOLLARS AND POLICY CAN'T DO IT ALONE. SO FOR ALL THE SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHERS INVESTED ALSO IN THESE FUNDS. WE THINK THAT THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ASSETS RT AT LEAST LOOK FORWARD AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS RECOMMENDED AND- IT GERRY GANSLER THE- NOT MANY FOR. SEC IS RECOMMENDED IN HEAD OF COUNCIL ECONOMIC ADVISERS IS RECOMMENDED IN. NUMEROUS INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED TO INCLUDING SOME OF CALIORNIA'S LARGEST BANKS AND INVESTMENT INSTITUTIONS THANKS AMERICA WELLS FARGO PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE. SO TODAY WE'RE PRESENTING TO U. S. B. FOUR FOUR NINE. TO HOPEFULLY- BRING SOME MORE TRANSPARENCY TO THE PROCESS AND- LET THESE INSTITUTIONS MAKE SMARTER FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY DECISIONS FOR THIS THE RESPONSIBLE TO I WANT TO CLARIFY- THAT I DID MAKE COMMITMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME OPPOSITION CONCERNS AMENDMENTS- AND GIVING THAT GIVEN THE TIMING OF THE COMPRESSED COMMITTEE SCHEDULE. WE'RE WERE WE HAVE TO GET THOSE. AMENDMENTS DONE IF THE COMMITTEE GETS AT THE BILL GETS OUT TODAY TO TAKE THIS ALL IN APPROPRIATIONS- BUT JUST OUTLINED IT FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS OUT THERE WHO I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT ON- I THINK WE'VE BEEN MAKING A REALLY GREAT PROGRESS- THE AMENDMENTS INCLUDE TO THE CLARIFICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF A CLIMATE RELATED FINANCIAL RISK. TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS- THE CLARIFICATION THAT ONLY ONE. METER IS DISCLOSURE IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED FOR INSURANCE ENTITIES THAT MAY BE COVERED BY THIS LEGISLATION. AND THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT REPORTING NOT GO THROUGH- DO YOU HAVE P. I. A SEPARATE INSTITUTION BUT BUT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WHERE THEY'RE DOING THEIR EXISTING REPORTING THAT THAT- BUT THAT REPORTING WOULD WOULD SATISFY. THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. AND THEN ALSO TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION OF LOOMING FEDERAL ACTION AND WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTS AND TO MAKE SHOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT. SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. REQUIRE THE SAME KINDS OF- T. CFT REPORTS THESE CLIMATE FINANCIAL RELATED DISCLOSURES THAT HAVE BECOME THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR THIS CLOSURE WHICH IS LOOKING LIKE WHERE THEY'RE HEADED- THAT. THAT THAT COMPLIANCE WOULD SATISFY COMPLIANCE WITH THIS BILL WE WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE A DUPLICATIVE ENFORCEMENT OR COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK PUT IN PLACE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF ANTICIPATE WE HOPE WILL BE FEDERAL ACTION WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVELY LOBBYING AGAINST THAT ACTION BUT SHOULD THAT COME TO PASS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO IMPOSE SOME DUPLICATIVE OVERLAPPING OR PREEMPTED FRAMEWORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA- SO. THAT'S THAT'S AND THERE THERE'S ALSO A COUPLE- NEED THESE COMMITMENTS ALSO NOTED PAGE NINE INTENDED TO COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TO IF YOU GUYS WANT TO. TAKE A CLOSER READ IT THAT. I'M SO. THE BILL WOULD BE WOULD SPECIFICALLY ONLY ADDRESS THOSE FINANCIAL INSURANCE AND CORPORATE INSTITUTIONS WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN ANNUAL REVENUE TO PREPARE CLIMATE RELATED FINANCIAL RISK DISCLOSURE REPORT AND SUBMITTED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE- IS THIS STANDARD- THE TECH BY THE TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE RELATED. RISK DISCLOSURES BEEN ADOPTED BY OVER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS WORLDWIDE AND I THINK CALIFORNIA OUGHT TO BE AT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR. I WE'VE CROSS REFERENCE NUMBER THE EFFORT BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THEIR NEW CLIMATE RELATED RISK DISCLOSURE ADVISORY GROUP THAT'S CO CHAIRED BY OPR DIRECTOR KATE GORDAN. AS WELL AS SOME FOLKS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY ARE HELPING SO WE WANT TO LINK TO EXISTING PROCESS EASIER AS WELL AS WHAT IS GOING ON OVER AT CDI. AND WOULD SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE. A CRUCIAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION MOVING ABOUT FOR NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT HOPEFULLY SETTING THE STANDARD FOR THE NATION AND THE WHOLE WORLD AS WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH.

CENTER OF SERVICE JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR SENATOR STERN I JUST WANT TO I KNOW YOU SPOKE TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON. THE AMENDMENTS I JUST WANT TO KNOW ARE YOU STILL COMMITTED TO MAKING THE CHANGES YOU AGREED TO IN THE BANKING COMMITTEE. I THINK YOU WENT THROUGH ON TWO OR THREE OF THOSE BUT- I THINK WE NEED YOU ON THE RECORD JOB THAT YOU ARE STILL COMMITTED TO THOSE THAT WAS A VERY LENGTHY DISCUSSION AT THAT TIME. FORTY MINUTES. YES- BSP CENTER SHE COULD. THE REALTORS ISSUE THE INSURANCE SECTOR REDUNDANCY ISSUE MAKING COLLUSION AND CONNECTION FEDERAL ACTION I THINK WITH THE- FORT. TO REITERATE WHAT I SAID AT THE OUTSET. YES PLEASE CLARIFY THAT AGAIN JUST I WANT TO BE RESPONSIVE HERE. IF YOU COULD JUST CORPORATE JUST REITERATE YOUR YOUR DOCUMENTS ON THIS SO WE WANT TO CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF CLIMATE RELATED FINANCIAL RISK TO MEET THE CONCERN FROM THE REALTORS- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE'S ONLY THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A DUPLICATIVE SET OF DISCLOSURES FOR COVERED INSURANCE ENTITIES- AND- TO BE CLEAR I THINK THERE WERE SOME IMPLICATION THAT I HAD. COMMITTED TO A SPECIFIC KIND OF REPORT THE AND A IC REPORT AS I NOTED DURING THE LAST HEARING WHEN I HELD UP BOTH THE NHC REPORT AND THE- T. CFT REPORT THAT THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE SO WE HAVE TO. RECTIFY THOSE DIFFERENCES- HI BEFORE I CAN COMMIT TO- JUST ACCEPTING WHATEVER IS WHATEVER SURVEYS CURRENTLY BEING FILED THERE'S SUFFICIENT. I'M SORRY. I SUPPOSE THAT. WANTED IT W. REITERATE OR CLARIFY THAT- BNA I SEE REPORT FOR INSTANCE DOESN'T DEAL WITH ANY REPORTING OF. ASIANS IN SCOPE IT DOESN'T ADDRESS- THE METRICS USED BY THE ORGANIZATION TO BRING THEIR CLIMATE RELATED RISKS IN LINE WITH THE STRATEGY FOR THE COMPANY IT DOESN'T- IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE RESILIENCY ORGANIZATION'S STRATEGY- SO THERE'S A FEW GAPS SO I'M LOOKING FORTY CONSULTING WITH THE- IT CONVINCED THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ESPECIALLY WHAT THEY HADIN MIND THERE BUT- AGAIN WE WANT ONE FILING PATHWAY. ONE DISCLOSURES- AND THEN THE LAST PIECE IS THE BETTER THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPROVED THEIR OWN CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE PRODUCT. PROCESS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE. THIRTY TO PREEMPTIVE HERE TO- IF THEY SO CHOOSE BUT IF THE IF FORCED TO ALLOW SPACE TO REGULATE IN THE FIELD THAT- THESE THESE KIND OF DC FTA FILINGS WITH THE FEDS WOULD. SATISFY OUR STATE REQUIREMENT TO THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA TRY TO DUPLICATE IS FILING REQUIREMENTS HERE- WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT- SO STILL REMAIN COMMITTED TO ALL THAT AND- HAPPY TO TAKE ANY FURTHER INPUT OR STRUCTURE TO WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS BUT- YES YEAH. SAME SAME COMMITMENTS BEFORE. YEAH AND I AM A STAR DOING SOME. DECEMBER BANKING WILL OF COURSE IT BACK OF THIS GUY GOT SO CLOSE THANK YOU SENATOR STERN I THINK THE NEW THAT YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON IT IS. OUR FIRM- OF LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE FOR THOSE WHO RAISE THAT ESPECIALLY THOSE TODAY ALL ON THE LINES WITH THEIR ON OPPOSITION SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT- COMMAND YOU FOR OUR YOUTH COMPLICATED ANY AND YOU'RE STILL ARE WORKING HARD TO. RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES. I'M OF THE BILL AND SAID IT'S GONNA OF THE BILL BILLS A MOVE TO AND. MY LAST QUESTION MISTER SKINNER. THANK YOU- CINDERELLA I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR BRINGING FOR. I THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR SETTING UP. THIS WORKING GROUP AND I THINK IT'S- IT DID HAS VALUE TO GIVE IT SOME. HELP GIVE ITS MORE DEFINITION OR FOR SOME MORE- A CHARGE TO- AND THIS IS OUR CONSISTENT TRENDS THOUGH I WILL. THE WHOLE ISSUE OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL RISK RELATED TO CLIMATE THE CLIMATE CRISIS HAS REALLY BEEN ON GOING SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND- IT'S- I SUPPOSE I SHOULD NEVER BE SURPRISED BY HOW LONG SOMETHING STICK BUT I FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING IN ONE OF THE- ENTITIES WHO CALLED IN TALKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW THIS MAYBE WE DON'T WHY DO WE NEED THIS LIKE EVEN AN A I SEE NOW THAT'S THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. IT REQUIRES YOU KNOW THIS- DISCLOSURE WELL RETAIL YOU ALONE HAVING BEEN THE PERSON THAT INITIATED THE N. A. I. C. TO EVEN BEGIN CONSIDERING THIS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE SO I SPENT 200-032-0004 TWO THOUSAND FIVE ATTENDING ANY ICY MEETINGS AND INTERACTING WITH INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND THE MAIN RISK MODELLERS IN THIS FIELD TO TRY TO GET THE ENERGY TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS AND IT WASN'T IT IS ONLY I THINK THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO BEFORE THE ANY ICY SO. WHAT'S THAT YOU KNOW FIFTEEN YEARS OR SOME LATER BEGAN TO PUT SOME THINGS INTO PLACE AND STILL NOT THE TYPE OF COMPREHENSIVE DISCLOSURE THAT MANY INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR AND MODELING AND- SOME HAVE PUT INTO PLACE SO. AT THIS I THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF- AS WE MOVE FORWARD LOOK WE'RE ALREADY IN DOOR KNOCK AND REVERSE. FIVE CLIMATE CHANGE WE MAY BE ABLE TO AVERT ITS WORST CONSEQUENCES BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA TO GET RID OF IT AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND. THE FOR ALL OF THE DIFFERENT RISKS MUCH BETTER AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE MAKE A LARGE INVESTMENT SO. I THINK WHAT- WHAT SENATORS. IS WORKING ON AND TRY TO CALL HERE GOOD BY. THE COMMITTEE MM AND I KNOW MISTER WORK OUT ALREADY MOVE TO BUILD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SKINNER- CERTAINLY THIS ISSUE I'VE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN DID SOME BILLS ON THIS TOPIC SO I'M I'M DEFINITELY SUPPORTING THAT THE SENATORS BILL TODAY. SUCH A MOVE BY CENTER TASK IF YOU LIKE TO. FIVE CLOSE CENTER WESTERN. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU THE ROBUST CONVERSATION TODAY AND KIND OF FOR THE WORK LIES AHEAD I WOULD JUST SAY IN CLOSING YOU KNOW I HEARD A- WE FOR PRESSING PAUSE. ON THIS LEGISLATION OF FROM THE BANKING INDUSTRY. AND YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT. PRESSING PAUSE ON THIS WILDFIRE SEASON IS NOT A PAUSE THIS DROUGHT IS NOT CAUSING- AND TO DEFERRED TO WASHINGTON AND WAIT FOR THEM TO ACT WHEN AGAIN THERE'S ACTIVE LOBBYING FROM THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AGAINST ALL THOSE EFFORTS TO TRY TO STOP THAT IN CONGRESS- TO TRY TO STOP THIS NEW STC FROM ADOPTING ALL THIS WORK. AND TELL US TO PAUSE WHAT ADVOCACY CONTINUES- TO ME SEEMS LIKE A MISGUIDED EFFORT- IF I HAD A SENSE THAT SAY THE BANKING INDUSTRY WAS GONNA SUPPORT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE SEC RIGHT NOW AND THAT THERE REALLY WAS NO NEED FOR CALIFORNIA LEGISLATION AB ONE THING BUT I'M SEEING. QUITE THE OPPOSITE SO I THINK THIS BILL IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT KEEP MOVING- AND KEEP PUSHING MS AND BUILDING ON FOLKS LIKE SENATOR SKINNER'S EFFORTS FROM BACK IN THE NINETIES SO- WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE BEEN PATIENT THIS LONG SO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.
