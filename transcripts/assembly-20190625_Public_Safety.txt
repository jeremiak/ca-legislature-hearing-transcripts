QUIRK [inaudible] SANTIAGO [inaudible] X.. A QUORUM IS PRESENT I BELIEVE WITH THE MATHIS YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU ONE THING SECOND. THANK YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- GOOD MORNING SENATE BILL THREE OR FOUR ALLOWS DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO CONSOLIDATE FELONY ELDERLY INDEPENDENT ADULT FINANCIAL FRAUD CASES THAT SPAN MULTIPLE COUNTIES. INTO A SINGLE PROSECUTION UNDER THIS LEGISLATION ELDERLY OR DEPENDENT VICTIMS OF A SERIAL PERPETRATOR WOULD NOT HAVE TO COPE WITH THE CHALLENGES OF TESTIFYING MULTIPLE TIMES. IN A MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IMMOKALEE AS PROSECUTORS TRY THEIR CASE. DEPENDENT ADULT AN ELDER FINANCIAL ABUSE IS THE FASTEST GROWING CRIME OF CRIMES IN THE UNITED STATES. IS THE BABY GENERATE BABY BOOMER GENERATION AGES FINANCIAL CRIMES AGAINST THE ELDERLY WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO INCREASE SB THREE OH FOUR WILL ALLOW THIS GROWING POPULATION. TO BE GIVEN MORE PROTECTION AND CONSIDERATION AS VULNERABLE VICTIMS UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION THREE EIGHTY SIX A IT ENSURES THAT THE PROSECUTION WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE. A PRESIDENT WRITTEN EVIDENCE FOR THE WRITTEN EVIDENCE THAT ALL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AGREE TO ONE COUNTY BEING SELECTED. ADDITIONALLY A JUDGE'S REQUIRED TO WAY WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER THE CASES SHOULD BE TRIED IN ONE COUNTY FOR PROSECUTION THE LOCATION COMPLEXITY OF THE LEAGUE LIKELY EVIDENCE WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE OFFENSES OCCUR THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENDANT AND THE PEOPLE IN THE CONVENIENCE OF HARDSHIP. THIS MEASURE HAS ENJOYED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT -- I THINK THEY'RE WITNESSES HERE AND I APPRECIATE THE MOTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU TERRY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN RESOLUTION MUCH LEARN WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WE LET THIS YOUNG MAN THROUGH ASKED ME. WE'RE SEEING A CAN WE MOVE THE MIKE UP SO WE CAN. SO EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LARRY MORSE THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. AT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MARGOT GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SENATOR FOR NARROWING THE BILL TO FELONIES ONLY INITIALLY INCLUDED MISDEMEANORS AS WELL SO WE APPRECIATE THAT -- HOWEVER WE STILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE BILL. OF THIS CLUB INCLUDES BOTH ELDER ABUSE AND FINANCIAL CRIMES. OF FINANCIAL CRIMES ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER TYPES OF OFFENSES LIKE SEXUAL ABUSE OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WHICH CALIFORNIA. ALLOWS MULTI JURISDICTIONAL PROSECUTION. CONSOLIDATION IS PROBLEMATIC FOR THE DEFENSE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS IT'S INCONVENIENT FOR DEFENSE WITNESSES AND IT'S TOTALLY UNWORKABLE FOR COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S WHO DEFEND THE MAJORITY OF THESE CASES. WHO HAVE NO POLICE OR OTHER PROSECUTORS TAURIEL INVESTIGATORS TO INVESTIGATE OFFENSES OCCURRING IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION? JURISDICTIONS NOT ONLY IS THAT CONSOLIDATION PROBLEMATIC FOR THE DEFENSE BUT IT GIVES THE PROSECUTION AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. THEY WILL GET CONVICTIONS IN CASES WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL WASN'T GUILTY BECAUSE WE CASES WILL BENEFIT FROM THE SHEER WEIGHT OF AGGREGATING THE CHARGES. ADDITIONALLY SOME PROSECUTORS WILL ATTEMPT TO CHERRY PICK THE COUNTY FOR TRIAL SO THAT THEY CAN GET JURIES MORE LIKELY TO CONVICT. AND I TRIED TO THINK OF IF I HAD EVER HAD A CASE WHERE CHARGES HAD BEEN CONSOLIDATED. AND I COULDN'T THINK OF ONE BECAUSE NO. ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS CHOSEN TO CONSOLIDATE CASES FROM OTHER COUNTIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY -- PERHAPS SAN FRANCISCO BY BUT OTHER THAN THAT. FURTHERMORE THE GENERAL AND TIME HONORED RULE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT CRIMINAL TRIAL TRIAL SHOULD BE HELD IN THE AREA WHERE THEY OCCURRED. WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THAT RULE BUT THEY SHOULD STATE JUST THAT EXCEPTIONS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON SB THREE OR FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THEY BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE YOUR I WAS LIKE OH YEAH AND RIVAL PLEASE ADDRESS SOME CONCERN BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO IN WE DID NARROW THE BILL OF THE ISSUE RELATED -- TO EXPANDING THE JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS YOU KNOW IT IT'S IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT FINANCIAL ABUSE ANY DIFFERENT THAN ELDER ABUSE WHEN WHEN IT'S STILL. YOU HAVE A OF A VULNERABLE POPULATION THAT IS. AS FALLING VICTIM TO SO MANY OF THOSE THOSE CRIMES AND THOSE ATTEMPTS AT TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR VULNERABILITY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS LOOKING AT THE POPULATION. NOT NECESSARILY THE CRIME THAT'S COMMITTED AGAINST AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VULNERABLE PART POPULATION AND THEY SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THOSE THOSE ACTIONS SO I FEEL THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT OF IT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS THIS IS NOT. IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE TO TO TO PROSECUTE THIS IN THE SINGLE JURISDICTION WE PUT A NUMBER OF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. OF THE LOCATION AND COMPLEXITY THE LIKELY EVIDENCE WHERE THE MAJORITY DEFENSES OCCURRED THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENDANT AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S UP TO THE JUDGE TO MAKE THE DECISION AND TO ALLOW THIS OR NOT ALLOWED THIS BASED ON THE AFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ON ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. IN ALL POPULATION SO I THINK WE'VE NARROWED IT AND IT IT. I BELIEVE PROVIDES THE THE PROTECTION NECESSARY AND I DO HAVE A WITNESS HERE WHO IS -- FROM SAN MATEO COUNTY IS THE TRAFFIC A LITTLE TOUGH GETTING IN HERE THIS MORNING AND WE DO HAVE TO MOTIONS AND I THINK WE'RE THE TO GO TO YOUR DISCRETION STRUCTURE. AND I BELIEVE BOTH PARTIES ARE THANKS I KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND I KNOW WHO YOU ARE THAT YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT. PEOPLE CHERRY PICKING OR PROSECUTED -- BUT WE JUST THIS WHOLE THING OF ELDER ABUSE IS REALLY -- SIGNIFICANT ESPECIALLY FINANCIAL ELDER ABUSE AND SO WE REALLY DO NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND DO SOMETHING I BELIEVE THAT THE COURT AND IN THEIR DISCRETION HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE. TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO AND HOPEFULLY EVEN THIS OUT AND SO THE CHURCH RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE. AND I THINK IF THERE IS A PROBLEM I THINK YOU CAN TALK TO THE SENATE ABOUT CORRECTING ANYTHING INEFFECTUAL LICKS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE A MOVED A SECOND CALL PAROLE.

GET THE IDEA [inaudible] CHAIRMAN -- MEMBERS GOOD MORNING -- THIS BILL CREATES THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROGRAM FOR PERSONS OF ON PAROLE. TO BETTER SERVE INDIVIDUALS ON PAROLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. OF FACING HOMELESSNESS -- WE HAVE AN EXISTING PROGRAM ESSENTIALLY -- THERE WAS A STUDY DONE BY UCLA ON THIS PROGRAM. WE SHOW THAT IT FAILED TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE IT DOES NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MEDICARE ALL. OF PROGRAM AND WE'RE REALIGNING THIS PROGRAM SO IT DOES TAKE A PHOTO OF USE OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. AND HAS A HIGHER DEGREE OF EFFECTIVENESS I HAVE SOME WITNESSES ALTERNATE OVER THEM. AND THEY CAN -- TESTIFIED IN FAVOR SO I'M GOING TO CUT MY REMARKS SHORT. TURNER LET ME LET ME LISTEN TO THE WITNESSES MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK. THANK YOU SENATOR THE MORNING SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING WE KNOW THAT INCARCERATION HOMELESSNESS AND RECIDIVISM ARE CLOSELY LINKED -- ABOUT TEN TIMES IS -- PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF INCARCERATION ARE ABOUT TEN TIMES AS LIKELY TO BECOME HOMELESS IS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT -- AND EVEN MORE COMPELLING PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RESET OF EIGHT THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSE. THE STRONG LINK -- A FOR FORMER CARS SERRATION AND HOMELESSNESS ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO IN EQUITY -- AMONG OUR HOMELESS POPULATION WITH 40% OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION BEING AFRICAN AMERICAN INEQUITIES IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM CONTRIBUTE DISPROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. AMONG CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. ENDING HOMELESSNESS IMPROVES OF FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS CHANCES OF STAYING OUT OF PRISON. RECOVERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS AND ACCESSING TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING SEVERAL STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FUNDING PERMANENT HOUSING OR HOUSING WITHOUT LIMITS OF LINT LIMITS ON LENGTH OF STAY. WITH INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT PROMOTE HOUSING STABILITY THE COMBINATION ON THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING. FOR PEOPLE ON PAROLE OR PROBATION -- SEVERAL OF THESE STATES INCLUDING OHIO AND NEW YORK HAVE DONE THE VALUATIONS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND THE COP FOUND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM OF 4260%. AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. I NAY ARE PEOPLE FOR A NEAR PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE CYCLING BETWEEN RYKER'S ISLAND AND HOMELESS SHELTERS PHONE SUPPORT OF HOUSING. NOT ONLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM BY IT ALSO REDUCE PUBLIC SECTOR COSTS AND RESULTED EVEN IN COST SAVINGS TO HEALTH CARE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEMS. PARTICIPANTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO ABUSE SUBSTANCES AND MORE LIKELY TO ACCESS TREATMENT FOR MENTAL L.. COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP. DOZENS OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING HEARING CALIFORNIA REPORT DECREASED JAIL DAYS RECIDIVISM AN IMPROVED HEALTH AS A RESULT OF SUPPORT OF HOUSING. SB TWO EIGHTY TWO WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE THIS EVIDENCE BASED MODEL TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS. FOR PEOPLE ON PAROLE IT WILL CONTENT CAN ACT PARTICIPANTS MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE DISORDER TREATMENT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT THROUGH COUNTY MEDI CAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. WHICH WILL HELP THOSE COUNTIES ACCESS 5290% FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE COSTS OF THIS TREATMENT. AS SENATOR BELL SAID RIGHT NOW UNDER THE EXISTING PROGRAM WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE FUNDING RE DIRECTED FROM. THAT PROGRAM IS PAYING A 100% OF THE COST MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. SB TWO EIGHTY TWO WILL ALSO MOVE FUNDING TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS THE GREATEST COMPETENCY IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. SB TWO EIGHTY TWO WILL ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH TO REDUCING RECIDIVISM AMONG CALIFORNIANS MOST LIKELY TO BE SET OF EIGHT AND IT WILL NOT ONLY TRANSFORM THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOUSING NEEDS FOR PEOPLE ON PAROLE IT WILL REDUCE AND EQUITIES AND OUR RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LENDING CROWDY AND I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN AND ALL OF US AND THEN. A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION EMPLOYING AND WORKING TO UPHOLD THE DIGNITY OF FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. I'M ALSO FORMALLY INCARCERATED. I LIKE TO SHARE MY STORY ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING AND KEEPING HOUSING AS A PERSON RE ENTERING SOCIETY AND PRE -- POST INCARCERATION. WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED I TOOK THE TIME TO WORK ON MYSELF I TOOK NUMEROUS CLASSES FACILITATED CLASSES? ADDRESS THINGS ROB PASS AND FOCUS ON BEING A BETTER ME. I REALIZE THAT IT WAS MY POOR CHOICES THAT LANDED ME IN MY SITUATION AND I WAS READY TO MOVE FORWARD IN MY NEW BEGIN AND BE IN A BETTER ME. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST. POWERFUL THINGS THAT KEPT ME MOTIVATED AND GROUNDED -- PLANNING FOR MY FUTURE. AFTER A LITTLE OVER EIGHT YEARS MY DAY HAVE FINALLY COME AND I WAS READY TO BE A PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN. EAGER TO BUILD A PRODUCTIVE LIFE. I WAS GIVEN FOUR MONTHS INSIDE A TRANSITIONAL HOME IS SEEM LIKE THE MOMENT I STEPPED THROUGH THOSE DOORS. I WAS GREETED WITH A HARSH REALITY. USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT THAT YOU JUST CAME HOME ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTION IS -- HOW DO YOU FILL? YES I WAS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO BE HOME BUT I WAS FULL OF ANXIETY WORRY AND FEAR. I QUICKLY LEARNED UPON MY RELEASE THAT THE AVERAGE RENT WAS AT LEAST A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. I KNEW THAT FINDING ADEQUATE HOUSING WAS A VITAL COMPONENT IN THE SUCCESS OF MY FUTURE. BUT I WAS GIVEN JUST FOUR MONTHS TO FIGURE THIS OUT. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A LIVABLE WAGE JOB CLOTHING AND MONEY FOR FOOD I FOUND MYSELF LIVING LOSING CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF. LIVING IN A COLD WET HOME THE MAIN TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WAS HOUSING I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT I WAS FAR FROM ALONE FOR MY ANXIETY AND WORRIES. OUR CASE MANAGERS HAVE LITTLE TO NO RESOURCES SO SAYS SAYS SO WE WE WERE ALONE IN FIGURING IT OUT. ONE OF MY ROOMMATES WHO WAS OPEN ABOUT HER MENTAL HEALTH ILL NAY SHARE WITH ME THAT THIS WAS HER SECOND TIME IN A TRANSITIONAL HOME. SHE SAID THAT WHEN SHE WAS THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE RAN OUT OF TIME BEFORE FINDING HOUSING SO SHE HAD TO LIVE IN A CAR FOR A WHILE. DUE TO HER MENTAL HEALTH SHE WAS GRANTED ANOTHER FOUR MONTHS INSIDE THE TRANSITIONAL HOME. I WATCH MY ROOMMATES SEARCH FRANTICALLY FOR HOUSING OFTENTIMES ENGAGE IN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GET SKETCHY SITUATIONS. RESOURCES THE FINE ROOMMATES SOMETIMES A LOOK LIKE SHE WILL FIND GOOD LEADS BUT THEY WILL LEAVE -- NEVER CALLED HER BACK AFTER MEETING HER. OTHER TIMES I WE HEAR HER COMMUNICATING WITH MEN WHO WERE RENTING AND SOMETIMES HERE RED FLAGS. THERE WAS NO ONE THERE WAS NO ONE REALLY THERE TO HELP HER AND HER SPECIAL NEEDS FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE FACING HOMELESSNESS. AFTER TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. AT THE FOUR MONTHS IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING I WAS FORTUNATE TO FIND A PROGRAM THAT HELPS OF HOUSE FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. IN THE COMMUNITY FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS BUT AFTER THAT TOM MIKE OTHER FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE I WILL AGAIN FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO SECURE HOUSING. AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE AREAS IN THE COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT IS GENERALLY LEGAL TO DENY HOUSING TO PEOPLE SOLELY. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD. BECAUSE OF THESE CHALLENGES I FACE THE REAL POSSIBILITY ABILITY OF NOT SECURING SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT ALL. MANY OF MY HOUSE MAY SUFFER FROM SOME SOME FORM OF MENTAL ILLNESS INCLUDE IN THE TRAUMA OF INCARCERATION AND THE MENTAL EMOTIONAL SCARS OF THE EXPERIENCE WITH TOM ALSO DEAL WITH IN HEALING FROM. FOR US FINING HOUSING IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WITH A CRIMINAL CONVICTION NOT TO MENTION THE EXTREME COSTS OF HOUSING. WITH ALL DESIRE TO MAKE IT ON OUR OWN AND MOVE FORWARD IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY HOUSING IS NOT A PRIVILEGE IT'S A NECESSITY. PLEASE WELL YES FOR SB TWO EIGHTY TWO AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES. IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BASED. IN CHICAGO. THIS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BY NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES -- WE RESPECT THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR -- AND AND WHAT THE PROBLEM HE'S TRYING TO ADDRESS WE THINK IS A CRITICAL ISSUE IN THE COMMUNITY -- BUT AT THIS TIME WE HAVE STATE WORKERS -- WHO -- I WILL INTRODUCE A SHORTLY -- TO MY LEFT WHO -- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT THE BILL MIGHT HAVE AND THE IMPACT ON EXISTING POSITIONS IN THE STATE -- AND STATE CIVIL SERVICE -- SO AT THIS TIME I LIKE TO TURN OVER TO OF DUAL JOHNSON FROM CASA. FIFTY SEVEN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- A BILL JOHNSON PRESIDENT OF ASKED ME COUNCIL FIFTY SEVEN I JUST LIKE TO INTRODUCE -- OUR MEMBERS WHO WORKS DIRECTLY WITH DEPARTMENT OF PAROLE OPERATION CDC ARE -- WHO'S A SENIOR PSYCHOLOGIST pSPECIALISTS AND WORKS DIRECTLY -- TO LIAISE BETWEEN. CDC ARE AND ISN'T IT PROGRAM SO A DOCTOR RESERVOIR. GOOD MORNING -- I'M BATMAN RESERVE FOR I'M A SENIOR PSYCHOLOGIST FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PAROLE POPULATION PEOPLE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED FOR THE PAST EIGHTEEN YEARS. I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL -- SB TWO EIGHTY TWO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- ABOVE ALL IT -- NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE SAVING -- ALSO IMPACTS NEGATIVELY THE CDC OUR EMPLOYEES. AND IN MY OPINION THIS BILL IS PREMISED ON INACCURATE DATA. WHEN THE BILL WHEN I READ THE BILL THEY WERE REFERRING TO A UCLA STUDY? THAT WAS FROM THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WORD THE IS ME DOLLARS WORSE AND WORSE SPEND ABOUT -- THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PER MONTH FOR HOUSING PURPOSES. AS OF OF MAY OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE AMOUNT THAT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- THE PAROLE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY EXPENSE IN HOUSING ONLY. IS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND I BELIEVE THAT IF ANYTHING WE NEED MORE RESOURCES FOR HOUSING PURPOSE IS NOT TO REDUCING OR GIVING IT TO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN. A SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO MANAGE THE PART THE POPULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO. THE BILL WAS BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WAS LIKE. THE IS ME DOLLARS WERE SENT ABOUT THIRTY TWO HUNDRED BASED ON THE UCLA STUDY. NOW WE'RE SPENDING FIFTY TWO THOUSAND THIS IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE BILL AND I BELIEVE THIS IS THE AT OWN USE FOUNDATION. SO I AM OPPOSING. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YES -- MY NAME IS JAMES SWEENEY I'M WITH BAY PACKED THE BLACK AMERICAN POLITICAL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE OPPOSE THIS -- BILL FOR THREE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS THE FIRST REASON THAT WE OPPOSE THIS BILL IS BECAUSE THAT IS THE SMITH PROGRAM IS FOR THOSE WHO ARE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL. AND TO MERELY **** THESE DOLLARS FROM CDC BREAK THE CONTRACT AND GO TO TRADITIONAL HOUSING PROVIDERS IS NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF THE DUALLY DIAGNOSED SEVERELY MENTALLY DISABLED. SECONDLY -- AND CANDIDLY -- THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS -- AND MINORITIES ARE PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN RUNNING. OPERATING AND HAM DILLON. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEY ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION BUT THAT THE EMPLOYMENT PIECE. IS IS RIGHT AND FINALLY -- MY COLLEAGUE THE PSYCHOLOGIST HERE IS TELLING YOU. WHAT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS I BELIEVE THIS IS A RECIPE FOR FAILURE I BELIEVE THE INTENT? IS GOOD BUT I THINK IT'S A RECIPE FOR FAILURE BECAUSE THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION -- THE DUALLY DIAGNOSED SEVERELY MENTALLY DISABLED. ARE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THEM THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT IN PLACE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE -- NEED THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT THE OTHER HOUSING PROVIDERS MAY NOT BE IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE. AND FINALLY YOU JUST SNATCHING THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS BILL HAS COME BEFORE YOU. AND I WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO DO WHAT YOU DID THE PREVIOUS THREE TIMES AND THAT IS OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COMPARING QUESTIONS FROM COMMITMENTS THERE QUIRK YES -- WITH REGARD TO THE OPPOSITION. YOU REALLY SHOULD PUT IN THE LETTER BECAUSE COMING UP AT THE LAST MINUTE LIKE THIS. WE DON'T HAVE A WAY OF CHECKING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THE OTHER THING IS THERE WAS A TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDY FROM UCLA YOU SAID THE LAST STUDY WAS MANY YEARS AGO. WHICH SHOWED THAT THIS DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND IN ADDITION ONCE YOU'VE GOT HOUSING IF THE PERSON IS MENTALLY ILL THEY GET THEIR SUBJECT TO MEDI CAL. AND THE REASON I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A GOOD. HAS BEEN MOVED YET. NOW ALL MOVED TO BAIL. I'M SORRY IT'S BEEN MOVED. AND SECONDED RIGHT OKAY. ALL RIGHT OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES MISTER LACKEY. A FIRST OF ALL I'D I FIND THE I HOPE WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS BECAUSE OUR NEW TO ME. AND THEY SEEM TO BE QUITE THE GENTLEMAN AS YOU KNOW ALL THE THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED -- SERVICE NETWORK IS CLEARLY IN JEOPARDY. WITHOUT THE INCARCERATED PIECE -- THIS BODY IS NOT DOING A GOOD JOB OF FUNDING. THAT SERVICE ASPECT AND THIS JUST ADDS TO THE DISTRESS TO THAT THAT WHOLE. A SERVICE MODEL THAT. ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS I HAD IS -- THE DURATION OF ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE SOME. SOME NEXT -- INDICATORS IN THE ACTUAL BILL. AND IN ONE PORTION OF THE BILL IT INDICATES THAT -- THEY'RE ELIGIBLE SO LONG AS MEDICALLY NECESSARY. THEN JUST FURTHER IN THE BILL. AS SAYS THE ELIGIBILITY LAST AS LONG AS A PARTICIPANT NEEDS THE ASSISTANCE. AND THEN IN THE THIRD. JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN AT SAYS THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE SO LONG AS A PARTICIPANT NEEDS THE SERVICES OR THE GRANT PERIOD DOWNS. SO IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING TO ME. AND IF YOU COULD TRY TO BRING SOME CLARITY TO THAT PIECE I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT ALSO. THE RAINY OTHER. QUESTIONS [inaudible] OKAY GOOD. THE ONE OKAY -- ESSENTIALLY HERE'S THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN CARS RICH PEOPLE IN THE STATE FACILITIES. ONCE THEY LEAVE THE STATE FOR SO THERE IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE ON A ROLL IN THE PAROLE SYSTEM. AND IF THEY HAPPEN TO NEED. MENTAL HEALTH -- PROGRAMS -- THEY SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND ARE ELIGIBLE -- UNLESS THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN INCOME. WHICH IN THAT CASE THEY WOULD HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE THEY WOULD BE IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. THE MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS RUN BY THE COUNTY. AND I WILL QUOTE A LETTER FROM THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES FOR YOU -- THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH NOTICES THE COUNTY'S INVOLVEMENT IN THIS NEWLY CREATED PROGRAM WOULD FACILITATE CONNECTING PAROLEES. THAT NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY NETWORK OF RESOURCES AND SUPPORT OF PROGRAMS. SO THE IDEA OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO GET HIM INTO THOSE COUNTY SYSTEMS. PROVIDE THAT HOUSING. AND THEN CONNECT THEM WITH THE EXISTING COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS WITCHER THE SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE EXISTING. PROGRAM WHICH IS A SEGREGATED OUTSIDE THE COUNTY. MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT WE THE STATE ARE PAYING FOR A 100% OF THE MENTAL HEALTH. COST SO SEND MY OPINION THE BILL IS AN IMPROVEMENT. IN A IN A AN IMPROVEMENT AND AND AND AND ESTABLISHES A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE COUNTIES. IN THE STATE. FOR A PROPERLY HANDLING. OF PAROLEES LEAVING THE INCARCERATED SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA SO. THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF HOW. THE COUNTIES TO MILL HEALTH. YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION DOESN'T DO MENTAL HEALTH. SO WE WANT TO LINK THESE PEOPLE UP WITH THE COUNTY SYSTEM AND THAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT THING WE CAN DO AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES. IF I COULD JUST ADD OF SLAUGHTER TO TO THAT -- ON THE MENTAL HEALTH PIECE THE THE PARTICIPANTS TO HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEW PROGRAM AS WELL -- ENDS THE UCLA STUDY -- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK POINTED OUT THERE'S JUST TWO YEARS AGO FOUND THAT -- PARTICIPANTS IN THE CURRENT PROGRAM ARE ONLY ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR AN AVERAGE OF NINE TO TEN MONTHS. IN WHICH THAT TIME THEY TRY THEY BASICALLY DROP OUT OF THE PROGRAM THEY'RE NO LONGER RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. EVEN IF THEY DO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THROUGH THE TERM OF THEIR PAROLE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A BREAK AND TREATMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE DROPPED FROM THE PROGRAM AND THEN THEY HAVE TO SEEK MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FROM THE COUNTY. BECAUSE THAT AS SENATOR PELL SAID THAT IS THE OF THE JURISDICTION THAT PROVIDES MENTAL TREATMENT UNDER MEDICARE ALL SO THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY TRYING TO PREVENT. THE BREAKING TREATMENTS TRYING TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED SOLID MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS -- IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY ABOUT THE INCONSISTENCY IN THE LANGUAGE. THE FIRST CITATION THE FIRST LANGUAGE YOU CITED ABOUT -- AS LONG AS MEDICALLY NECESSARY THAT IS HOW LONG I COUNTY HOUSE TO PROVIDE. MEDICARE ALL MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TO THE PARTICIPANTS SO THEY HAVE TO THEY CANNOT CUT THE PARTICIPANT OFF AT ANY TIME AS LONG AS THEY HAVE MEDICAL NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT UNDER MEDICARE ALL. OUR PROGRAM -- THE OTHER TWO CITATIONS YOU MENTIONED WE DO WE DID RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S AN INCONSISTENCY IN THOSE -- TWO PROVISIONS AND SO WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT AND AMENDMENTS AND LATER COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR RAISING. OKAY. YOU MAY CLOSE WITH BETTER QUOTE -- MISTER CHAIRMAN DR DREW THIS WEEKEND ATTACKED. THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL HE SAID THAT'S NOT REALLY THE SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS. HE SAID WE NEED TO HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. WELL I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH DR DREW BUT I ALSO AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT WE NEED. SUPPORT OF HOUSING THIS PROVIDES BOTH THIS IS THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT WILL PROVIDE BOTH AND IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. IN A LOT OF OTHER STATES OF PROVEN SUCCESS AND IN NEW YORK AND OTHER STATES I REGION I VOTE ON THIS. SO. LET ME JUST JUST FROM A PROCEDURAL. STANDPOINT AND ONE JUST AS COMMITTEE CHAIR AND JUST. ONE IS JUST MY PERSONAL. PREFERENCE I'M FROM A PROCEDURAL IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE OPPOSITION. IF YOU COM. AT THE LAST MINUTE. TO MAKE. STATEMENTS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO BETTER. THIS HAS BEEN I WENT TO SENATE. I HAVE I HAVE SOME TO I DO HAVE THE BEST. POLICY STAFF MONEY ASSEMBLY SIDE. I WILL SAY ALSO ON THE SENATE SIDE BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE CAME FROM THE ASSEMBLY BUT THAT'S A WHOLE. OKAY AND SO I HAVE PEOPLE THAT CAN THOROUGHLY BET. ANYTHING. I ME THOROUGHLY VETTED SO THAT. WE CAN WE CAN. LAKE CREDENCE TO WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT IF HIS OPPOSITION -- I HAVE STAFF HERE THAT CAN THOROUGHLY VETTED -- AND SO IT'S IT'S NOT FAIR TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- IT'S NOT FAIR TO YOUR MEMBERS DOES THAT COME IN THAT DILUTES THE ELEVENTH HOUR. FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT AS AN AUTHOR. WHO? HAS HAD BILLS COME OVER. AND ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE HAVE PEOPLE FRIENDS OF MINE ALLIES MIGHT COME IN AT THE LAST MINUTE. WITH PROBABLY SOME VALID POINTS. BUT IT WAS AT THE LAST MINUTE HAVE SABOTAGE ONE OF MY BILLS SO I PERSONALLY. IT PERSONALLY BOTHERS ME WHEN THAT HAPPENS ESPECIALLY WHEN. PEOPLE HAVE AT MY OFFICE IS ALWAYS OPEN PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO MY OFFICE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IS NOT BIKE WERE HIDING AND YOU CAN'T GET TO US -- AND IN A THIRD THING I KNOW. THE AUTHOR MYSELF AND MANY MEMBERS HERE WERE NOT IN THE BUSINESS. OF TRYING TO PUT PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES OUT OF BUSINESS AND IN FACT WE PROBABLY NEED ALL OF THEM. NOT ONLY WITHIN CDC ARE WE MAYBE NEED MORE IN C. D. C. R. MAY EVEN BE MORE ON THE OUTSIDE SO. I I I I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE A DECREASE IN AMOUNTS STAFFING. ON BOTH SIDES YOU'RE LOOKING AT A WAY THAT WE CAN ADDRESS TO POPULATION WITH MORE RESOURCES BECAUSE THAT'S I'VE I'VE HEARD YOU SENATOR BILL. TALK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES AND SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE INTENT. WITH THIS BILL OR ANY OF YOUR BILLS IS -- TO IS TO REDUCE STAFFING ON ON ANY LEVEL AND A AND THEN THE LAST THING I JUST LEAVE IT LEAVE YOU WITH. AS PEOPLE DO WHAT IT'S A PEOPLE START LOOKING AT REHABILITATION WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT WAYS TO MAKE IT BETTER. RALPH LOOKING AT WAYS TO CURB WAY THROUGH ALSO LOOKING AT WAYS THAT. ROOMS THAT AREN'T FUNCTIONING THAT WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. AND NOT TO USE A MENTAL HEALTH PHRASE BUT WERE YOU CALL SOMEONE TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN EXPECT A DIFFERENT RESULT. OKAY. SO LET'S. CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION ON CHAIRS RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE AND THAT WE MOVE THIS ALONG. AND THAT THE D.. THE OPPOSITION. IF THEY HAVE SUGGESTIONS OF WAYS WE CAN IMPROVE -- RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEMBERSHIP THAT THEY HAVE THEIR INSIGHTS YOU SEE ARE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES AND WE CAN BOLSTER THAT. THEM PLEASE COME TO THIS COMMITTEE COME TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHICH I ALSO SAID ON M. BUT I THINK. CENTRE BELL AND I WILL WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BOTH SAID THAT PART TOO BECAUSE THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT PART OF MAKING THIS WHOLE SYSTEM WORK WE SHOULD NOT BE BITING AT POINT. GOING AT ONE ANOTHER WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE A HOLISTIC APPROACH AND AND GETTING THIS DONE -- MISTER CHAIRMAN I GREW UP TO OF A AYE AYE I'M SORRY I'M THE LAST ONE TO SPEAK YOU'RE THE LAST YES. I'D LIKE TO REASON REASON I HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE I'VE CUT OFF REPUBLICANS AND GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE SO. I HAVE TO CUT YOU OFF.

THREE NINETY THREE CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY PROVIDES THAT A SOMEONE IS CHARGED WITH DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE THEIR VEHICLE CAN BE IMPOUNDED UP TO THIRTY DAYS. WELL THE LOS CLEAR ABOUT THE RULES FOR IMPOUNDING A VEHICLE THAT WAS USED BY SOMEONE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LAW IS LESS CLEAR. ON THE RULES FOR BOATING THAT HAS BEEN USED IN A BOATING UNDER THE INFLUENCE ACCIDENT OR A. B. YOU AYE. THIS WAS DISCOVERED WHEN TALKING TO ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS BELINDA MARGIE ODA. WHILE ENJOYING A BOARDING TRIP WITH HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS ON THE COLORADO RIVER. THEY WERE HIT BY A VEHICLE THE WHOLE BOAT GOING THIRTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR. BELINDA AND THREE OTHERS SUFFERED INJURIES INCLUDING THE DRUNK DRIVER. SERRA MELINDA'S DAUGHTER DIED. SHE WAS ONLY TEN YEARS OLD. ALTHOUGH THE PERPETRATORS BUT ALCOHOL CONTENT WAS NEARLY THREE TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT. HE NEVER LOST OWNERSHIP OF HIS BOAT WHICH WAS ULTIMATELY HIS WEAPON. SB THREE NINETY THREE STATES THAT OF A VESSEL ISSUES IN THE COMMISSION OF A B. Y. INVOLVING THE UNLAWFUL KILLING OF A PERSON THAT THAT VESSEL. WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME SEIZURE AN IMPOUND RULES AS A VEHICLE USE IN A D. YOU ARE. SB THREE NINETY THREE IS A SIMPLE MEASURE TO ALIGN OUR WATERWAYS B. Y. LAWS WITH OUR ROADWAY DO YOU I LAWS.

UNFORTUNATELY EACH YEAR BRINGS ANOTHER ROUND OF TRAGIC ACCIDENTS OF LOSS OF LIFE. CAUSED BY THOSE WHO OPERATE THEIR VESSELS WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL DRUGS OR BOTH IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALCOHOL WAS THE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. IN ONE HUNDRED AND TWO BOATING DEATHS AND DRUG USE WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR FOR ANOTHER TEN TO US ACCORDING TO THE COAST GUARD. CALIFORNIA LAW PROPERLY AND APPROPRIATELY RECOGNIZES THE SAME STANDARD OF INTOXICATION TO THOSE OPERATING A VESSEL AS A SOMEONE OPERATING THE VEHICLE ON OUR STREETS NAMELY A BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL OF POINT. ZERO EIGHT FOUR ABOVE. THIS BILL WOULD FURTHER CONFORM THOSE LAWS BY ALLOWING FOR THE SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDING OF ABOUT WHAT IT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE UNLAWFUL KILLING OF A PERSON. SIGNIFICANTLY IT DOES NOT MANDATE THE SEIZURE OR IF ON IMPOUNDING OF A BOAT A JUDGE MAY STILL CONSIDER THE LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT. ABILITY TO PAY IMPOUND FEES OR UNFAIR INFRINGEMENT UPON COMMUNITY PROPERTY RIGHTS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO SEIZE THE VESSEL. R. D. Y. LOS AND A CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE ABOUT OUR IN TOLERANCE FOR THOSE WHO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL OF VEHICLES WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS. OUR B. Y.

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY OKAY GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS AND OF MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I HAVE AGREED TO THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS. SO AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE EXTENDS FROM THREE YEARS TO TEN YEARS THE TIME LIMIT FOR CRIME SURVIVORS TO APPLY FOR HELP. FROM THE CALIFORNIA VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD IN PAIN FOR BILLS AND EXPENSES THAT RESULT FROM VIOLENT CRIME. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW SURVIVORS WHO ARE UNAWARE OF THE PROGRAM OR WHO ARE NOT YET READY. TO APPLY OR REWARD ADDRESSING THE TRAUMA YEARS AFTER THE VICTIMIZATION. MAY BE LEFT WITH NO FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. YOUNGER VICTIMS LATINO AND BLACK VICTIMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE UNAWARE. BUT INTERESTED IN VICTIMS COMPENSATION ASSISTANCE WELL WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE RESTITUTION FUND IS GOING THROUGH CHANGES WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH CAL B. C. B. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AS CONVERSATIONS AROUND FUNDING CONTINUE. BUT ONE THING IS FOR SURE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CANNOT IGNORE THE THOUSANDS OF SURVIVORS IN OUR STATE WE PROVIDE. BILLIONS TO THE PRISON SYSTEM WE NEED TO SHOW A SIMILAR RESOLVED FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SURVIVED THE CRIMES. PASSING AS BE THREE SEVENTY FIVE IS ONE OF MANY STEPS WE MUST TAKE TO ENSURE THAT MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE SURVIVED TO CRIME ARE SUPPORTED AND HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED. TO HEAL WE WANT TO CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD IN OUR STATE WE CANNOT CONTINUE WITH INEFFECTIVE POLICIES. THE FAILED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SURVIVORS WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES DENISE HOLLINS THE STATE DIRECTOR FOR CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. AND ANDREA PERRY POLICY ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. THANK YOU YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TOTAL AND SPLIT UP ANYWHERE YOU WANT. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS A FREE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ITEM FOR SHARING THIS TIME WITH ME TODAY GOOD MORNING TO ALL OF YOU. MY NAME IS TO NEEDS HIGHLANDS AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR FOR CRIME SURVIVORS WHO SAFETY AND JUSTICE. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE TWELVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA CRIME SURVIVORS IN MY NETWORK. WHO ARE ADVOCATING TO REMOVE THEIR YEARS FIRM VICTIMS COMPENSATION INTO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALING IN TERM RECOVERY SERVICES? I'M A MOTHER I'M A LONG TIME ADVOCATE FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION MY COMMUNITY. AND I'M A CRIME SURVIVOR. SIX YEARS AGO TODAY ON JAN ON JUNE TWENTY FIFTH. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MY BROTHER JAMES SMITH. WE SHOT AND KILLED IN SAN FRANCISCO. AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH I WAS A COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER. SUPPORTING FAMILIES IN CRISIS. BUT WHEN MY BROTHER WAS KILLED. MY FAMILY SPIRALED INTO CRISIS. I BECAME INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH TRAUMA AND WHAT IT DOES. MY TERM RESPONSE MY BROTHER'S DEATH WAS TO BECOME A FIRST RESPONDER TO MY REVIEW FAMILY. JAMES IS MOTHER'S TRAUMA RESPONSE WAS TO ISOLATE HERSELF FOR MONTHS AFTER HIS FUNERAL SHE REFUSED. TO SPEAK TO ANYONE AND ACCESS THEIR P.. SHE REFUSED ANY SERVICES WERE CONNECTED TO OUR SON'S DEATH. MY FOR SURVIVING SIBLINGS WERE STRUGGLING EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY THE LAST JOBS WERE THREATENED WITH EVICTION. SOME EXPERIENCE MENTAL HEALTH EPISODES. THEY ALL NEEDED IMMEDIATE SUPPORT. AND WERE DENIED VICTIMS COMPENSATION FOR SAFETY REASONS WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT THOSE SERVICES WERE CONNECTED TO THE DA'S OFFICE. FOUR YEARS AFTER LOSING GAMES ALLOWS THE SECOND BROTHER TO HOMICIDE ON JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MY BROTHER MITCHELL WAS KILLED. WHATEVER FRAGMENTS WERE HOLDING OUR FAMILY TOGETHER AFTER JAMES IS DEATH WERE NEARLY DESTROYED AFTER MITCHELL. I KNEW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE THE BAND WITH TO HOLD MYSELF TOGETHER MY FAMILY TOGETHER THROUGH THIS TRACK THROUGH A TRAGEDY OF THIS MAGNITUDE FOR THE SECOND TIME. AS OUR TO RECOGNIZE THE SYMPTOMS OF TRAUMA AND PTSD THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING. AND THE TRAUMAS THAT MY FAMILY HAD EXPERIENCE THAT IT LED TO THOSE TWO DEATHS. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE DECISION TO START RECEIVING THE SUPPORT THAT I NEEDED FOR MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN. I WISH THAT I COULD SAY THAT THE REST OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE DONE THE SAME. I'M HERE TODAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY ARE READY THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES. SEEING SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IS ABOUT MORE THAN A TIME TABLE IS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. IT'S ABOUT CENTERING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY CRIME BECAUSE IF WE'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE TRAUMA THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. AND ALLOW THEM TO STABILIZE THEIR LIVES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY'LL BE SAFE IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE SAFE WILL BE GREATER WHAT DO WE KNOW TO BE A FACT ONE TO THREE ONE IN THREE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE CRIME. THE BIGGEST PREDICTOR OF BEING A VICTIM OF CRIME IS THAT YOU'VE BEEN A VICTIM BEFORE AS IN THE CASE OF MY FAMILY. THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC A REPEAT VICTIMISATION. ARE LEAST LIKELY TO ACCESS ANY KIND OF HELP. AND THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHO NEED SUPPORT AND HOW THESE RULES WORK FOR THEM. WE AS A STATE OR IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING MORE TRAUMA INFORMED. WE UNDERSTAND AND KNOW SO MUCH MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS AND WE'RE WORKING EVERY DAY TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF VICTIMS DAHLE ACCESS VICTIMS COMPENSATION BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CONNECT TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND EVEN REPORTING CRIME. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE TRAUMA DOESN'T EXIST IN THAT WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ADDRESS IT. WITHOUT REPEATEDLY IN STUDIES THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT TO THEIR FRIENDS OR TO A HOSPITAL THEN TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IN COMMUNITIES. THAT EXPERIENCE REPEAT VICTIMISATION SO WE MUST MAKE THE WHOLE SYSTEM MORE ACCESSIBLE AND MORE COUNTABLE. OVER THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN FOR VOTER WILL BEGINS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS ANDREA TERRY ON THE POLICY ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO SENATOR ALSO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS WELL AS THE CHAIR. AND COMMITTEE STAFF WHO WORKED WITH US ON THIS BILL -- CRIMES RIVERS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE IS PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL -- WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED BY CAL THE CB -- SUCH AS PHYSICAL AT BEING PHYSICALLY INJURED OR THREATENED WITH INJURY IT ALSO PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENTS FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNERAL EXPENSES -- HOME SECURITY -- THIS BILL WILL DECREASE BARRIERS FOR CRIMES REVERSED ACCESS NECESSARY TRAUMA RECOVERY RESOURCES THAT SUPPORT AND COUNSELING THE FISCAL IMPACT. OF NOT HELPING THE MOST VULNERABLE ARE FAR GREATER THAN THE SPECIFIC COST OF PROVIDING COMPENSATION THE FISCAL IMPACTS ARE PART OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CHRONIC TRAUMA GOES AND DRESSED INCLUDING COST OF HEALTH CARE THE COST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE THAT FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. SELF MEDICATING CANNOT MAINTAIN STABLE EMPLOYMENT -- EMPLOYMENT AND CANNOT MAINTAIN FAMILY STABILITY OR FALL INTO A HOLE AND THEY MAY FINALLY FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS WE JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SINCE MY TIME IS PROBABLY UP THANK YOU.

TO HAVE PROMPT AND UNIMPEDED ACCESS TO AN INMATE WAS TEMPORARILY HOUSED AT A COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. A COUNTY MEDICAL FACILITY OR A STATE A SIGN OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW STATE PSYCHIATRISTS OR PSYCHOLOGISTS TO HAVE PROMPT ACCESS TO INMATES RECORDS FOR THE PERIOD OF CONFINEMENT AT THAT FACILITY IN ORDER TO COMPLETE A MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS EVALUATION. TO ENSURE THAT MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS ARE PROPERLY EVALUATED AND TREATED PURSUANT TO PENAL CODE SECTION. TWO NINE SIX TWO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PSYCHIATRISTS EMPLOYED BY CDC ARE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS HAVE ACCESS TO THE INMATES HEALTH RECORDS. AND ACCESS TO THE INMATE. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN CONCERN WITH THE DELETION OF SECTION. THREE THOUSAND THREE E. TWO AND I AM COMMITTED TO RETAINING THAT SECTION IN THE BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MY NAME IS DOCTOR ALLISON STANLEY I AM AND AM DO EVALUATOR WHICH MEANS AN EVALUATOR PURSUANT TO PENAL CODE TWENTY NINE SIXTY TWO FOR CDC ARE -- IT'S COULD YOU SPEAK A LITTLE MORE LOW YES TO THE MICROPHONE YES. AND I'M DOCTOR ALLISON STANLEY I AM AND A AND M. DO EVALUATOR FOR CDC ARE WHICH MEANS AN EVALUATOR PURSUANT TO PENAL CODE. TWENTY NINE SIXTY TWO IT SOMETIMES DOES HAPPEN THAT ARE CDC ARE INMATES. GO OUT TO COURT FOR SOME TYPE OF HEARING DEPENDING ON WHATEVER A PENDING CHARGE A PREVIOUS CHARGE. A CHILD SUPPORT HEARING WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE THEY'RE STILL IN OUR CUSTODY BUT THEY SIT IN JAIL AND WAIT FOR THEIR HEARING TO OCCUR AND THEY CAN BE IN JAIL. FOR MONTHS IT DEPENDS HOW IMPACTED THE COURTS ARE. WHILE THEY'RE IN JAIL IT CAN OCCUR THAT THEIR PAROLE DATE HAPPENS THEY'RE REQUIRED BY STATUTE. PC TWENTY NINE SIXTY TWO TO BE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE CONTINUE TREATMENT. IN A STATE MENTAL INSTITUTION PRIOR TO THEIR PAROLE DATE. IN ORDER FOR US TO EVALUATE THEM. AGAIN THEIR NCDC ARW CUSTODY BUT THEY'RE SITTING IN A JAIL IN ORDER FOR US TO EVALUATE THEM PROMPTLY WE NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEM WHILE THEY'RE IN THE JAIL. THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN THERE ARE NUMBER OF ROAD BLOCKS THAT ARE OFTEN ESTABLISHED AND SO IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO HAVE THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED. TO IT HERE TO THE STATUTE AND SEE THOSE INMATES PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT INMATES WERE EVALUATED UNDER. TWENTY NINE SIXTY TWO ARE VIOLENT THEY'VE COMMITTED VIOLENT OFFENSES AND THERE POTENTIALLY SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL. SOIT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE AN IMPUTED ACCESS TO THOSE INMATES AND TO THEIR RECORDS. WHETHER THEY'RE IN CDC ARE OR WHETHER THEY'RE IN OUR CUSTODY BUT SITTING IN A COUNTY JAIL. AS I SAID THAT CURRENTLY DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN. AND THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE THOSE TOOLS IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE INMATES TO CARRY OUT THE JOB THAT WERE. REQUIRED TO DO. MISS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BY NELSON -- WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES. PLEASE BE TO SPONSOR THE BILL FOR THE REASONS THAT WERE STATED BY. ODD -- DOCTOR STANLEY THINK THIS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION ENSURING THAT THE WORKERS WHO ARE HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH PERFORMING A STATE SERVICE CAN IN. DEED AND HAVE THE TOOLS TO INDEED PERFORM THAT SERVICE -- REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES -- THAT THEY MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES OR THAT THEY MAYES MY FIND THEMSELVES AND THESE CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE ACCESS -- TO THE SEMIS -- SO FOR THERE ARE THOSE REASONS WE LIKE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS AND HER STAFF FOR THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE A BETTER ABOUT THE BILL HOWEVER WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD ACTUALLY EXPAND. THE MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDER POPUATION. ON BAD IS THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO ARE DETAINED. AN INVOLUNTARY LEE COMMITTED TO STATE HOSPITALS AFTER THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR PRISON SENTENCE AND THE IT ALL WILL EXPAND SAID BIO DOT WOWING CDC OUR DOCTORS. TO BOTH NOT ONLY EVALUATE PEOPLE WHO ARE INITIALLY RELEASED ON PAROLE AS THE DOCTOR HAS DESCRIBED TO MIGHT BE OUT TO COURT. BUT IT ALSO ON MAY BE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WOULD ALLOW -- PAROLEES WHO WERE IN COUNTY JAIL FOR TECHNICAL OR MINOR VIOLATIONS OR WHO ARE ALREADY OUT ON PAROLE AND PERHAPS A BEEN. FIFTY ONE FIFTY TO THE LOCAL -- COUNTY HOSPITAL TO BE EVALUATED [inaudible] AND THE MTO LAW TWENTY NINE SIXTY WAS FIRST ENACTED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO TO DETAIN PRISONERS WHOSE MENTAL ILLNESS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THEIR OFFENSE. AND WHO WERE DEEMED TOO DANGEROUS TO RELEASE. ALTHOUGH IT INITIALLY WAS LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF VIOLENT FELONIES. IT HAS NOW BEEN EXPANDED. BY CASE LAW INTERPRETING. PC TWENTY NINE SIXTY TWO SUBSECTION E. SUBSECTION TWO SUBSECTION QUEUE SO THAT IT INCLUDES THREATS BOTH IMPLICIT OR EXPLICIT. AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF MY CLIENTS -- I'M GONNA CALL IN JOHN SMITH -- HE'S PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC. AND HE THREATENED A JUDGE HE SHOWED UP IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND YELLED I'M GOING TO KILL YOU -- WHICH SHE NOW REFERS TO AS HER NEIGHBORS WAKE UP CALL IT ALARMED HER NEIGHBORS SHE'S PRETTY BLASE ABOUT IT HERSELF -- HOWEVER. OF JOHN SMITH RECEIVED TWO YEARS STATE PRISON -- DURING PRISON HE BECAME OBSESSED WITH THE GOLD STANDARD FOR US CURRENCY. AND HE WAS EVALUATED AND FOUND TO BE A MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS. SINCE THIS CRIME THREATEN VIOLENCE HE REMAINED. MENTALLY ILL SINCE HE STILL HAD DELUSIONS. BAT MORE CONTROLLED BY HIS MEDICATION. SO HE WAS SENT TO A STATE HOSPITAL HE WAS SENT TO ATASCADERO. ALMOST TWENTY YEARS LATER. HE STILL BELIEVES IN THE GOLD STANDARD. AND HE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL AND OUT ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE TO THE COMMUNITY. HE HAS NEVER HEARD ANYONE HE HAS NEVER BEEN VIOLENT -- HE IS STILL ARGUING THAT THE GOLD STANDARD APPLIES AND WISHES TO PROTEST BEING FORCED TO PAY IMPERFORATE PAPER CURRENCY ARTS OVER GOING TO RIDE THE BUS AND BART. AND FOR THAT HE GETS VIOLATED IN GOES BACK AND FORTH TO THE MENTAL HOSPITAL HE'S NOW IN THE SEVENTIES HE HAS NUMEROUS PHYSICAL PROBLEMS -- THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE WAY TO DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH FOR EXAMPLE THE ANNUAL COST OF KEEPING SOMEONE AT AN INDIVIDUAL AND VOLUNTARILY AT THE TASK OF DARRYL STATE HOSPITAL IS ALMOST. TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THERE ARE OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR M. DO INDIVIDUALS JUST DONE ATASCADERO. I'M 48% OF THAT HOSPITAL'S PATIENT POPULATION THERE ARE FIVE STATE HOSPITALS THAT EMBRYOS ARE SET. TO WE WOULD CONTEND THAT MDO IS SHORT SIGHTED PUBLIX POLICY. THE UNDERLYING POLICY RATIONALE OF DEALING WITH MANSON KARCHER CARTS RATIONS BY NOW HAVING MASS INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT. IS FLAWED. OTHER COUNTRIES AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. PROMOTE A MODEL OF TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY OR IN SMALL PROTECTED FACILITIES LOCATED IN THE COMMUNITY CLOSER TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS. IN PERIODS OF ACUTE HOSPITALIZATION ARE NEEDED AND THIS AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS PEOPLE'S MEDICATIONS STOP WORKING OR THEY NEED A CHANGE IN MEDICATION -- LARGE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTIONS LIKE ATASCADERO STATE HOSPITAL. REGARDLESS OF THE BEST INTENTIONS OF THE STAFF. END UP FOCUSED ON KEEPING THE PATIENTS LOCKED UP [inaudible] YOUR SECOND. CAN I BUY ALL RIGHT RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THOSE THOSE KIND OF INSTITUTIONS DON'T WORK AND COMMUNITY. HOSPITALIZATION DOES. WITH ASKS FOR RESPECTFULLY FREER NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MISTER QUIRK AND START. IF THE CURRENT SYSTEM WERE WORKING. FINE BUT IT'S CLEARLY NOT HALF THE PEOPLE IN THE JAILS AND THE PRISONS HAVE MENTAL PROBLEMS -- AND FURTHER -- HALF THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS HAVE WELL MAYBE NOT HALF MAYBE A QUARTER BUT IT'S A LARGE NUMBER -- WHERE WE CLEARLY ARE NOT CATCHING ALL THE PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP? AND FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL ARE YOU MAKING A MOTION MISTER COURT I I MADE OUR ENVIRONMENT. OF YES YEAH HE MADE IT AND I WAS SECOND. YOU MAY CLOSE -- CAN I ALLOW MY SPONSOR TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED AS MY CLOTHES THANK YOU. YEAH ME TOO WE WILL CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION WITH OUR INTENT IS JUST TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO AND MASON MIGHT BE OUT IN COURT AS THE MEMBER DESCRIBED OR NOT CURRENTLY HOUSING CDC ARE SO WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE -- IN THE ANALYSIS IS DONE THE BILL -- PARK. WE ARE CONTINUING TO AND WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO SEE IF WE CAN -- ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS BUT AT THIS TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL JUST ONLY SPEAKS. TO THE OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE GOING OUT INTO -- FACILITIES ARE BEING DENIED ACCESS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE ACCESS TO CONDUCT. THE EVALUATIONS THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT SAID THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND HOPE YOU CONTINUE WORKING RIGHT I THINK. IN A CHAIR FOR A COMMITTEE I BUT BASIC BECAUSE OF WE GOT HAVES CONTINUING OF CARE. AND WE GOT PEOPLE WHO ARE FAST YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE PATIENT TO CONTINUE. TO TO WORK WITH THEM NO MATTER WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED AND SO THAT'S VERY VERY -- I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S JUST SIX CENTRAL ON THAT WE DO THAT AND THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS WELL BALLOT IN AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE AREN'T ANY.

ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS PETER B. RING FROM THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION -- I WANT TO START BY THANKING THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK IT HAS DONE ON POLICE USE OF FORCE BOTH ON THIS BILL AND ON A. B.. THREE NINE TWO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DEMANDING CHANGE AND LAWMAKERS LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP THE GOVERNOR HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO CRAFT STRONG FAIR AND MEANINGFUL REFORMS. AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE BILL'S AUTHOR IN LAW ENFORCEMENT -- THAT THROUGH THIS BILL THEY ARE MAKING IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BY PLACING REQUIREMENTS ON AGENCIES USE OF FORCE POLICY SO THAT EVERY AGENCY REQUIRES DE ESCALATION. REQUIRES OFFICERS TO REPORT AND INTERVENE IN EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE AND ACQUIRES OFFICERS TO PROVIDE MEDICAL AID FOLLOWING THE USE OF FORCE AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL EVEN WITH THE AUTHOR'S LAST MINUTE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED WITH JUST THIS MORNING. RETAIN SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT UNDERMINE REFORMS SOUGHT BY AB -- THREE NINE TWO AND THESE MUST BE ADDRESSED AND WE REMAIN OPPOSED AND LESS AMENDED. FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BILL DEFINES THE WORD FEASIBLE IN A WAY THAT UNDERMINES THE DE ESCALATION REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL AND KEY ELEMENTS OF AB THREE NINE TWO BY DEFINING FEASIBLE. TO MEAN IT AN ACT THAT CARRIES NO INCREASE IN RISK TO AN OFFICER THAT IS NOT A REALISTIC DEFINITION FEASIBLE DOES NOT MEAN ZERO RISK IT MEANS REASONABLE RISK. AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFTEN NOTES OFFICERS FACE SOME RISK IS PART OF THE JOB. IN THE CASE OF DEADLY FORCE THE SAFEST ROUTE WILL ALWAYS BE FOR OFFICERS TO SHOOT ANY POTENTIAL THREAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ANY OTHER COURSE OF ACTION INCREASES THE RISK TO OFFICERS TO SOME DEGREE BUT THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE MEASURE WE MUST REQUIRE OFFICERS TO TAKE TIME TO DE ESCALATE WE'RE DOING SO DOES NOT UNREASONABLY. INCREASE THE RISK TO OFFICER. THE DEFINITION OF FEASIBLE AS WRITTEN NOT ONLY MAKES THE DE ESCALATION REQUIREMENT IN THIS BILL EXTRAORDINARILY WEAK BUT UNDERMINES KEY LANGUAGE IN AB THREE NINE TWO THAT WAS ADDED TO ACHIEVE. LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISE. SECOND THE BILL IN SECTION ONE SUBDIVISION AFTER CLAIRE'S THAT NO POLICY CAN ANTICIPATE EVERY CONCEIVABLE SITUATION OR EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH OFFICERS MAY FACE. THIS SUGGESTS THE DANGEROUS IDEA THE POLICIES ARE NOT DESIGNED TO APPLY TO ALL SITUATIONS IMPLIES THAT THERE MAY BE EXCEPTIONS TO AN AGENCIES USE OF FORCE POLICY IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT THE VERY POINT OF USE OF FORCE POLICIES AND OF THIS BILL IS TO REGULATE OFFICERS USE OF FORCE AT ALL TIMES INCLUDING EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS WHERE DEADLY FORCE IS REQUIRED. AND THE BILL LANGUAGE SHOULD NOT MONEY THAT. THIRD IN SECTION ONE G. THE BILL CONTINUES TO INCLUDE THE DECLARATION THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE OF FORCE POLICY IN TRAINING SHOULD BE ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE IN ANY PROCEEDING INVOLVING A USE. AN OFFICER'S USE OF FORCE. THIS LANGUAGE UNFORTUNATELY CREATES A PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO HAVE POLICIES IN TRAINING ON USE OF FORCE THAT ARE AS LACKS AND PERMISSIVE AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT OFFICERS CAN BE SHOWN TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICY IN TRAINING. IS INTRODUCED INTO EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO REDUCE LIABILITY FOR OFFICERS AND THE COSTS OF AGENCIES THAT INDEMNIFY THEM. INDEED THIS CRITICISM WAS LEVIED AGAINST LAST YEAR'S AB NINE THREE ONE IN AN OPINION PIECE WRITTEN JOINTLY BY THE LAPD'S HEAD OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING AND A LEADING EXPERT IN POLICING. THIS SHOULD BE REMOVED. FINALLY IN SECTION TO BE TWO THE BILL WOULD MANDATE A PROPORTIONALITY REQUIREMENT THAT MISSTATES THE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THAT TEST. THE BILL MAKES FORCE PROPORTIONAL TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF A SUSPECTED OFFENSE A CONSIDERATION THAT SHOULD ABSOLUTELY AFFECT THE OFFICERS ASSESSMENT OF THE THREAT. POSED OR THE NEED TO OVERCOME RESISTANCE BUT THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN INDEPENDENT CONSIDERATION. AN OFFICER MAY RIGHTLY EXPECT TO USE MORE FORCE RESPONDING TO A REPORTED SHOOTING INTO A NOISE COMPLAINT BUT AN OFFICER TRYING. TO MY APOLOGIES BUT AN OFFICER TRYING TO APPREHEND. AN ELDERLY ON ARM SUSPECT IN A FORTY YEAR OLD MURDER CASE WOULD CONSIDER MORE IN EVALUATING THE THREAT THAN JUST THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SUSPECTED OFFENSE. AND FORCE USED TO GAIN COMPLIANCE SHOULD CONSIDER THE SERIOUSNESS OF OFFENSE AND DEGREE OF RESISTANCE TO AVOID USING SIGNIFICANT FORCE AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL SUSPECTED OF ONLY A MINOR INFRACTION. BUT SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER MITIGATING SUBS CIRCUMSTANCES OR VULNERABILITIES OF THE SUBJECT AN OFFICER SHOULD NOT USE SERIOUS FOR FORCE AGAINST AN ELDERLY PERSON OR PREGNANT WOMAN EVEN IN THE FACE OF A CATEGORICAL REFUSAL TO COOPERATE. THE PROPORTIONALITY TERM SHOULD BE AMENDED TO REFLECT THAT. FINALLY IN OUR LETTER WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS WE BELIEVE WOULD INCLUDE PROVEN CLARIFY THE BILL CLARIFYING THE MANDATE ON POLICIES REQUIRING DE ESCALATION -- THAT THAT SHOULD INCLUDE LESS LETHAL FORCE THAT THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR DEADLY FORCE SHOULD NOT REQUIRE OFFICERS TO MAKE A CALL ON WHETHER FORCES EXCESSIVE. AND LEAVE THAT TO THEIR SUPERVISORS THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ON DE ESCALATION AND COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE SEPARATED FOR CLARITY. THESE ARE NOT THE BASIS OF OUR OPPOSITION BUT OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE BILL. WE KNOW WITH AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ENERGY HAS GONE INTO THIS ISSUE THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION BUT WE SHOULD NOT LET. WE SHOULD NOT UNDO THE GOOD WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY LETTING HARMFUL POLICIES IN AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE THESE MODIFICATIONS. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON KAELIN DEAN WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AT POLICY LINK -- WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED AND WE APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS MADE TO ADVANCE THE BILL HOWEVER WE FEEL THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL ISSUES WHICH UNDERMINE AB -- THREE NINETY TWO AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CHANCE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU -- TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. OUR MAJORITY ON BEHALF OF THE FIFTY LA FARMER POSITION. ANDREW MISS FISHER WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. JUST A JOB EMPLOYEES OF THE COMEDIAN OPPOSITION. BUT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS BURKE. YES I BELIEVE IF THE ACLU WOULD READ THE AMENDMENT STATE FIND THAT THIS IS IN LINE WITH. TWO NINE TWO IF WE WERE TO REJECT THIS TUESDAY IT WOULD SET THE WHOLE THING BACK -- I KNOW YOU DIDN'T LIKE TO NINE TWO FOR VARIOUS REASONS AS THREE NINETY THREE NINE TWO FOR VARIOUS REASONS SINCE DID SOME OF THE OPPOSITION -- I'M JUST SAYING THAT -- THIS IS HAT WE'VE GOT. WE SHOULD NOT HOLD UP THIS BILL AND I URGE ALL MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO VOTE I THANK YOU. AND YOUR QUESTION. WHICH CENTER HE JUST ADDRESS THE THE CONCERNS RAISED THIS UNDERMINE. THREE NINETY TWO YES I'M THE THIS IS BEEN IN AN EXTENSIVE -- VERY INTENSE NEGOTIATION PROCESS -- IT'S MY BELIEF -- AFTER. THAT AS WE SIT HERE TODAY THAT IT DOES NOT. BETTY IT -- WE MADE THE CONFORMING CHANGES THAT'S THE REASONTHAT WE HAVE CHANGES TODAY IS BECAUSE WE MADE SOME -- CONFORMITY CHANGES A THREE NINETY TWO AND FRANKLY THAT -- THIS BILL HAS BEEN -- HAS HAD HEAVILY INVOLVEMENT FROM LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THIS IS THE AGREEMENT THAT ALL. PARTIES HAVE HAVE AGREED TO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME OBJECTIONS BY ACLU BUT QUITE FRANKLY. THE LIST THAT I HAVE. HEARD TODAY IS LONGER THAN THE LIST THAT WE WERE GIVEN THE LAST TIME THAT WE WE HAD AROUND HAVE. OF NEGOTIATIONS SO IT TO ME IT SEEMS THAT THE LIST KEEPS GROWING LONGER AND LONGER AND AND AND FRANKLY -- I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET. TO A YES WITH THE ACLU MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO DO THAT -- I DON'T BELIEVE. THAT THIS UNDERMINES AB THREE NINETY TWO AND I AM ALL OF A THE BILL FOR TODAY -- I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE HERE BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T UNDERMINE THREE TWO AND THAT'S A LOT OF WORK PUT INTO THAT -- AND I KNOW YOU HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF WORK TO AS WELL BUT I WANT TO KEEP HONORING THAT THE COMMITMENTS IT WE MADE. THANK YOU. MISS BARKING. YESTERDAY WE STOOD ON THE FLOOR AND WE HAD A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR TERROR O'SULLIVAN WHO PASSED AWAY JUST LAST WEEK AFTER BEING SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY. AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REMEMBER THE LIVES THAT ARE TAKEN ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE AS WELL AND I THINK THE DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK. ON SB TWO THIRTY AND AB THREE NINETY TWO HONORED. THE LIVES LOST ON BOTH SIDES AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE AS A COMMITTEE. AND LEADERSHIP AND THE AUTHORS WORKED SO HARD TO GET TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD A BILL THE MAJOR THAT. USE DEADLY FORCE WAS ONLY USED WHEN NECESSARY. WE GAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TRAINING THEY WERE ASKING FOR THE ONLY TIME. I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE SIX MONTHS BUT ONCE SOMEBODY'S COMING TO MY OFFICE AND SAID. WE COULD DO BETTER WE WANT TO DO BETTER GIVE US TRAINING AND I SAID WOW WHO'S WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S ADMITTING THEY WANT TO DO BETTER AND I WILL HAPPILY JOIN YOU IN MAKING SURE YOU DO BETTER AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND SO I HOPE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING WHAT PROTECTS BOTH THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO SERVICE EVERY DAY AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THESE TWO BILLS DO. SO I ALSO URGING A VOTE. YES MISTER LACKEY. YEAH I WOULD LIKE THIS FIRST OF ALL JUST SAY. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU TO THE REMARKS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE -- BY THIS COMMITTEE. AND I FIND. THE ACLU'S OBJECTIONS. NOT ONLY UNREASONABLE BUT INSULTING TO THE PROCESS AND THE THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THIS VERY DELICATE DISCUSSION -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD WILL THAT'S BEEN GENERATED THROUGH THIS. THIS VERY -- DIFFICULT DISCUSSION. THAT ACTUALLY AS WAS MENTIONED BY [inaudible] THIS REMARK. WE HAVE LOSS OF LIFE RELATED TO THIS VERY VERY DELICATE TOPIC AND IT SHOULD BE GIVEN -- VERY VERY DEEP THOUGHT BEFORE WE EXPRESS. OURSELVES TONIGHT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THAT AND SAY THAT I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN ACLU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENT. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- FIRST LET ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA -- IT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED THIS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT AND VERY DIVISIVE -- IT TOPIC AND I GOT INVOLVED BECAUSE I'VE SERVED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ROLES -- FIRST AS A MOTHER BUT ALSO AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- ELECTED INDIVIDUAL AS A MAYOR WHERE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY AND AND SO I TOOK VERY SERIOUS -- THAT THE CHALLENGE TO TRY TO KEEP EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE AND TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN -- MAKE THE BEST -- CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO KNOWING THAT THE SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING FOR US AND AND WE NEED WE NEED CHANGE -- I ALSO WON AT REX RECOGNIZE -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO WHO DID AT A STELLAR JOB ON AB THREE NINETY TWO AND AND AND THANK HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN THIS WE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. HAVING OUR BILLS WORK TOGETHER AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT SHE'S DONE AS WELL -- THIS THIS BILL REALLY IS ABOUT -- CAREFULLY COMING UP ALONG SIDE AB THREE NINETY TWO AND REFLECTING THE VALUES THAT ARE EMBODIED IN THAT BILL. AND CREATING RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS USING BEST PRACTICES FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN A WAY THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE CULTURE IN OUR FIVE HUNDRED PLUS POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. SO THAT THERE IS A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR THE CHANGE THE OUT THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE BUT ALSO TO KEEP THEM SAFE AS THEY DO THEIR DAY A JOB ON A JOB THAT GETS THE MORE DIFFICULT EVERY DAY. AND SO -- IS THE BILL ARE ARE THE TWO BILLS PERFECT NO -- WHERE WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THEM AND -- AND AND AND I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT THE THAT WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD TO HAVE THE LANGUAGE. IN BOTH BILLS LINE UP WITH EACH OTHER AND TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT WERE MAKING THE CHANGE THAT WE REALLY WE REALLY WANT TO SEE SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I AND I AS I SAID.

WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN TODAY JUST COMMITTEES GOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN TODAY AND WITH THEIR HELP WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN ON THE FLOOR. WITH EVERYBODY PULLING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. IS NOW THE LEADER IN THIS I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOW THE LEADER IN WHAT EVER THIS IS RIGHT NOW. WE ARE THE STANDARD BETTER ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EVERYBODY ALL EYES ARE ON US. EVERYBODY'S WATCHING TO SEE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING. IS UNBELIEVABLY SIGNIFICANT AND WE NEED. TO TAKE CREDIT FOR IT. AND STOP IN FIGHTING WITH ONE ANOTHER AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE THIS IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS THE IMPLEMENTATION. WITHOUT A DOUBT WE DON'T IMPLEMENT THIS RIGHT. ALL THE ALL THE PHONE CALLS ALL THE HE THE THREATS ALL OF THE THE THINGS THAT EVERY LAST ONE OF US WENT THROUGH ON THIS COMMITTEE. EVERYONE HAS LOOKED AT BOTH BILLS HAD LOOKED AT THE AT EVERY WORD. AND WHEN I SAY WE DEBATED EVERY WORD. YOUR PEOPLE GIGGLING. WE DEBATED EVERY WORD IN BOTH BILLS. SO THIS BILL HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY VETTED BY EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND PRAGUE BY EVERYBODY IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. AND SO WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE FOR AN FOR THIS NOT TO HAPPEN. AND SO THE CHAIR STYLING RECOMMEND IN HIGH VOTE. I AM SUGGESTING THAT IS UNANIMOUS AS WE SEND IT TO THE FLOOR. MEANT SECTOR CALL THE ROLL. ON SB TWO THIRTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAND BACKING HANNAH HI MATHIS. MATHIS HI KAMLAGER-DOVE UP. QUIRK HI QUIRK I SANTIAGO. WICKS WICKS I THAT MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] OKAY. WE'RE WAITING FOR MR WIENER BECAUSE HE WAS THE NEXT BUT NEXT ONE IS MISTER PORTANTINO WITH ABOUT. SEVENTEEN BILLS JUST A FEW.

THANK YOU AND THEN YOU KNOW NOTE YOUR NEXT NO MATTER WHAT YOUR TO TOP THE LIST MISTER WEINER IS GONNA HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOU SECOND CLEAN. CITING HIS SUPPORT SUPPORT WE SHOULD BE. MORNING THANKS FOR BEING HERE. YOU MAY BEGIN MISTER GLAZIER IT WAS ASKING IF THAT WAS OPEN AND CLOSE. AT A CANDY. I THINK PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE BILL. I YOU PASS SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT -- MISTER LACKEY ADVANCE FOR THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN THE SAYS THE SAME FOR THOSE OVER. AND I THINK THE ARGUMENTS ARE PRETTY PERSUASIVE IN THE ANALYSIS AND I HAVE A WITNESS TO SPEAK IN FAVOR IN ADDITION THANK YOU. THE MORNING COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS MELISSA O'CONNELL I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INNOCENCE PROJECT AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE TWO OTHER INNOCENTS PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA -- WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS DON'T START AT A TRIAL -- THE COMPANY IN ONE PHONE FOUR CONVICTIONS TYPICALLY HAPPEN BECAUSE AN INVESTIGATION HAS GONE AWRY AND SO ACCESS TO PRE TRIAL DOCUMENTS IS CRITICAL TO A POST CONVICTION REVIEW. HOWEVER IT TAKES OUR OFFICES THREE TO FOUR YEARS TO REVIEW OUR CLIENTS CASES -- BECAUSE WORD WORKING WITH INCOMPLETES OR PIECEMEAL FILES BECAUSE OUR CLIENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO POST CONVICTION DISCOVERY. UP UNTIL LAST YEAR ONLY INMATES SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE OR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT HAD RIGHT TO POST CONVICTION DOCUMENTS. BUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OF INNOCENCE WORK IS THAT OUR CLIENTS ARE MORE OFTEN SENTENCED TO HIGH DETERMINATE SENTENCES OR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE. PUTTING THEM OUTSIDE THAT RIGHT. THAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR LAST YEAR IS AB NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY WHICH EXPAND EXTENDED THE CATEGORY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD SEEK DISCOVERY. HOWEVER THE LAW AND ITS CURRENT FORM HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO LITIGATION SUGGESTING THAT ONLY THOSE INMATES CONVICTED AS OF JANUARY ONE OF THIS YEAR. COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS CHANGE IN THE LAW. BUT WE KNOW IS A STATE THAT THERE ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN OUR PRISONS. I WANTED TO JUST GIVE A BRIEF EXAMPLE WE HAVE A CLIENT WHO WAS SENTENCED TO THIRTY TWO YEARS TO LIFE IN STATE PRISON -- WHEN WE GOT INVOLVED IN HER CASE -- I A LAWYER HAD PASSED AWAY. THE STATE COURT HAD DESTROYED THEIR FILE AND THE TRIAL EXHIBITS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IN HER CASE. THE STATE DENIED US ACCESS TO POST CONVICTION DISCOVERY BECAUSE HER SENTENCE FELL OUTSIDE OF EXISTING LAW. I'M CARLA SPENT SEVENTEEN YEARS WRONGFULLY INCARCERATED AND THE AND ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF OF THOSE YEARS WERE SPENT BEHIND US TRYING TO INVESTIGATE AND LITIGATE HER CASE UNTIL SHE WAS EXONERATED TWO MONTHS AGO -- WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY AS INNOCENCE PROJECTS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE VICTIMS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THESE CASES AND THAT'S WHY A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE REVIEW OF THESE CASES IS CRITICAL. AND SB SIX FIFTY ONE ALLOWS US TO DO THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT RIGHT FOR CONVICTIONS REMAIN INTACT AND WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS ARE RECTIFIED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARCO GEORGE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUSTICE DOESN'T. AND THAT THE COURT ROOM DOORS THERE'S MORE -- IN OUR EFFORT TO TRY TO FIND JUSTICE AND THEN THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU CHAIR OF RECOGNIZED VOTE. MAY CALL THE ROLL. ON SB SIX FIFTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JOHN SIR I LACKEY. LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAN BACKING AND I MATHIS. MATHIS NOT VOTING KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. QUIRK I SANTIAGO. WICKS. WICKS I THAT MEASURE PASSES BRADLEY MR PORTANTINO I HAVE. YEAH I'M HERE TO SERVE. YOU HAVE SB. SIXTY ONE ONE SEVENTY TWO THREE SEVENTY SIX AND SIX TWO ZERO YES SIR. AND I WOULD LIKE TO STATE I'VE SPENT MORE TIME WITH YOU THEN ALL YOUR SENATOR COLLEAGUES PUT TOGETHER ON YOUR BILLS WE WERE SUPPOSED TO KEEP THAT A SECRET OKAY I'M SORRY. DISREGARD WHAT I JUST SAID. ALL RIGHT. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING -- SB SIXTY ONE WHICH BROKE WHICH PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FROM MAKING AN APPLICATION TO PURCHASE MORE THAN ONE FIREARM. WITHIN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD FIREMAN'S WILL NOT BE DELIVERED WHATEVER THE DEALERS NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT WITHIN THE PRECEDING THIRTY DAY. THE PURCHASER HAD BAITED OTHER APPLICATION TO PURCHASE. A FIREARM IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED TO LIMIT THE PURCHASE OF HANDGUNS BUT RECENT DATA SUGGEST. THAT LONG GUNS ARE BECOMING A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF CALIFORNIA'S GUN TRAFFICKING PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS CALIFORNIANS HAVE TYPICALLY PURCHASE MORE LONG GUNS AND HAND GUNS. THERE'S NO REASON WHY SOMEONE WOULD NEED TO BUY MORE THAN ONE LONG GONE HER MONTHS PREVENTING THE FLOW OF GUNS IS IMPORTANT TO PUBLIC SAFETY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FIREARM. IS A HANDGUN OR A LONG GUN -- OR PURCHASE NEW FROM A DEALER OR THROUGH A PRIVATE TRANSACTION LIMITED FIREARM SALES TO ONE GUN PER MONTH IS A RECOGNIZED STRATEGY. TO REDUCE GUN TRAFFICKING AND KEEP FIREARMS OUT OF DANGEROUS HANDS THE BILL WAS ALSO RECENTLY AMENDED TO HELP CLOSE ANY LOOPHOLES FROM PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE YEARS. OF AGE FOR PURCHASE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC CENTERFIRE RIFLES BY REQUIRING HONORABLY RETIRED MILITARY IN LICENSE HUNTERS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WHO WISH TO ACQUIRE SEMIOTICS A CENTERFIRE RIFLE. BY DISLEY REQUIRING A CERTIFICATE OF ELIGIBILITY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- TODAY I HAVE. A MANDATE FROM THE BRADY CAMPAIGN UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF SB SIXTY ONE WE THINK CUTTING DOWN ON BULK PURCHASES IS A GOOD IDEA. AND OBVIOUSLY WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU YES GOOD MORNING. AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA. SO IN GENERAL OF BRADY CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THAT HAND GUNS AND LONG GUNS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAWS. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED THAT CAP -- THE NUMBER OF HANDGUNS THAT COULD BE. PURCHASED IN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD TWO ONE HAND GUN PER MONTH PER BUYER PER MONTH -- IN THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS. TO PREVENT THE TRACK OF TRAFFICKING OF HANDGUNS IT STANDS TO REASON -- THAT OF SOMEONE IS BUYING FIFTY GUNS AT ONCE THERE MOST LIKELY TURN AROUND AND SELLING THEM ON THE BLACK MARKET FOR PROFIT -- WE OBVIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THAT SAME CAPTION APPLIED TO LONG GUNS BASED ON A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST THAT -- MY HUSBAND AND I DID WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WE FOUND THAT EIGHTY ONE POINT 9% OF LONG GUNS WERE SOLD AS A SINGLE TRANSACTION. SO THEREFORE MOST LONGER BUYERS WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS LAW HOWEVER AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM ONE INDIVIDUAL PURCHASE A HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN LONG GUNS AND ONE MONTH. FURTHER WE FOUND THAT WHEN GUNS WERE ACQUIRED LONG GUNS WORK WIRED -- WITH A BALL PURCHASE THERE MOST LIKELY TO BE LOWER RECEIVERS WHICH AGAIN CAN BE SOLD PERHAPS ON THE BLACK MARKET AND BUILD UP INTO. ILLEGAL ASSAULT WEAPONS -- SO WE CONSIDER THIS TO BE A GOOD STRATEGY FOR CURBING GUN TRAFFICKING AND REDUCING OUR THE PLAY WE HAVE OF ILLEGAL GUNS. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THE CONCERNED REPEATEDLY IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW ARE WE IMPACTING LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS AND ARE WE HAVING DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WITH OUR LAWS. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL PLACES THE BURDEN ON THE GUN DEALER THEY'RE THE ONES WHO CANNOT MAKE THE SALE WHEN THEY'RE NOTIFIED BY DOJ THAT -- THAT THE PERSON'S ALREADY AND PURCHASE A GUN WITHIN THE LAST OUR THIRTY DAY PERIOD SO THE BURDENS ON THE DEALER NOT ON THE INDIVIDUALS KNOWING THIS LAW. ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW FOR THAT MATTER AND THEN FINALLY -- THE CENTER MENTIONED THE THAT THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO NARROW THE EXEMPTION THAT'LL THAT ALLOWS THOSE UNDER AGE TWENTY ONE TO BUY CINEMA SEMI AUTOMATIC CENTERFIRE RIFLE WHICH SADLY SEEMS TO BE THE WEAPON OF CHOICE -- IN TODAY'S MASS SHOOTINGS THERE ARE STILL WAYS THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS -- FOR THOSE UNDER TWENTY ONE TO ACQUIRE A FIREARM. I SUCH A FIREARM BUT THERE'S GONNA BE MORE HOOPS AND MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR SCREENING BEFORE THEY CAN OBTAIN SUCH A GUN WE THINK THAT IS ALSO IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS COMMITTEE HAS PASSED A LAW THIS. THIS LEGISLATION THIS POLICY SEVERAL TIMES -- AND I TRUST THAT YOU WILL. ARETODAY AS WELL I OR TRY VOTE THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER. IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. GOOD MORNING ELIZABETH HAS BEEN -- SOME BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE COUNTIES OF LOS ANGELES INVENTOR AND SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. CALVIN QUICK BAY AREA STERN ACTRESS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MY FAVORITE [inaudible] FOR SURE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAN PRESS HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH YOU AGAIN TODAY. AND UNHAPPY TO HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. ON ON THE FACE OF IT -- AND WE WILL SOON FIND OUT WHETHER A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT CAN ACTUALLY BE RATIONED THE EXERCISING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. AND THAT -- ISN'T IN THE PURCHASE OF A FIREARM. AND IF A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT CAN BE RATIONED IN YOU CAN BUY MORE THAN. ONE GONNA A MONTH. WHAT ELSE CAN BE RATIONED? THE ENUMERATED CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THAT ISSUE IS GOING TO BE DECIDED BY THE SUPREME COURT REALLY SOON. AND THAT MAY BE THIS LEGISLATURE INSTEAD OF JUMPING AHEAD MY WAIT AND SEE. WHAT THE SUPREME COURT DOES -- AND NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF EFFORT -- NEEDLESSLY WHEN -- OUR SOLUTIONS ARE ARE ARE ARE NOT. IN THE RATIONING OF CONSTITUTIONALLY ENUMERATED RIGHTS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND READ WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. WE'RE HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF GUN LAWS AND THIS IS A CONCEPT WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE ON FARM RATIONING AND AND THIS IS ONE MORE LAW THAT'S THAT'S FOCUSED ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS. THAT -- WHEN IT COMES TO PURCHASING A FIREARM YOU NEED A FARM SAFETY CERTIFICATE YOU NEED TO UNDERGO A BACKGROUND CHECK PHILIP A FEDERAL PAPERWORK STATE PAPERWORK -- UNDERGO A TEN DAY WAITING PERIOD WE ALSO OF LAWS DEALING WITH TRAFFICKING OF FIREARMS WITH STRAW PURCHASES. AND THIS LAWS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS BECAUSE CRIMINALS WHO ARE OUT THERE ACQUIRING FIREARMS REALISTIC MEANS OR WHO MAY BE TRAFFICKING FIREARMS. OR ACQUIRING THEM THROUGH STRAW PURCHASE OR ANY ANY OF THE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TARGET ARE NOT GONNA BE IMPACTED BY THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GO TO A DEALER TO PURCHASE. A FIREARM THEY'RE OPERATING OUTSIDE THE LAW THIS IS FOCUS ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AND I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY FOCUS ON THE CRIMINAL MISUSE OF FIREARM. RATHER THAN ADDING ONE MORE LAW ON THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE WHO MAY BE ACQUIRING MORE THAN ONE FIREARM FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES -- INCLUDING -- COST SAVINGS TIME SAVING SIX CETERA BECAUSE PURCHASING A FIREARM THE STATE IS IS A COSTLY PROCESS AND IT REQUIRES MULTIPLE TRIPS THE TO A DEALER AND AND SO SOMETIMES IT'S A CONVENIENT SAYING SOMETIMES IT'S YOU'RE GETTING INTO A COMPETITIVE SHOOTING SPORTS THAT MIGHT REQUIRE MORE THAN ONE FIREARM. AND SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD REALLY FOCUS ON THE CRIMINAL MISUSE RATHER THAN THOSE WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH OUR LAWS HERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES MA'AM GOOD MORNING AYE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KATHY LET'S REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION OUTDOOR SPORTS INSTALLATION SPARKLE OF INTERNATIONAL AND CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY ALL IN OPPOSITION IN THIS DOES DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS SPORTSMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WORK AT THE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION WERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] OF ANY ERA OPPOSITION. OF BRING IT TO COMMITTEE BUT I'VE REMOVED OIL. FOUR YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE THERE'S TO PREEN COURT MAYBE OPINING ON REGULATING OR YOU ST IN THIS LEGISLATIVE IN THIS SESSION BEFORE OCTOBER OR TO SUBJECT COULD COME UP NEXT YEAR ALL THIS IS -- SCHEDULE THERE ARE GOOD LOOKING THEY HAVEN'T. PUT A DEFINITIVE DATE BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF NEXT SESSION WHICH BEGINS IN OCTOBER. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] YES. I'M THANK YOU I HAD -- TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS JUST TO CLARIFY DOES THIS IMPACT -- THE FOLKS WHO WILL SELL -- WHO ARE BUYING -- WHO ARE ALSO PART OF A BUY BACK PROGRAM [inaudible] NO. SOME PART OF A BUY BACK PROGRAM OKAY SO THIS WOULD THAT'S A LIKE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S RIGHT RIGHT NOW IT WOULD NOT IMPACT THAT AT ALL OKAY. AND THOSE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN SEVERAL OF BEEN. DONE IN MY DISTRICT. OKAY SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY BECAUSE MOST FOLKS WHO ARE. GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN A BUY BACK PROGRAM MAY HAVE MORE THAN ONE GUN. THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHY ARE -- WHY IS THERE AN EXEMPTION -- TO VETERANS AND THOSE -- WHO ARE? HAVE AN ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN ARMED FORCES NATIONAL GUARD -- NATIONAL GUARD. FOR TWO REASONS TO STATISTICALLY THEY TEND NOT TO BE THE BULK PURCHASERS WHO ARE RESELLING THE GUNS TO THE NEFARIOUS HANDS AND WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A PRUDENT EXEMPTION THAT'S NOT WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES. OKAY THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE I GUESS THREE OF THE TEN MOST DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTINGS -- OCCURRED BY FOLKS WHO ARE VETERANS AND SO I CERTAINLY CONSIDER THEM TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FIREARM SAFETY AND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION. ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- YOU MAKE. EIGHT YOU MAY CLOSE I WAS GONNA DO. MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD COMMENT ON TWO OF THE OTHER POINTS. THAT WERE MADE BY THE OPPOSITION. OBVIOUSLY THE HANDGUN LAW THAT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE HAS NOT BEEN CHALLENGED -- AND SO THAT'S BEEN UPHELD. FOR A LONG TIME SO WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT BEING. AN ISSUE AND FRANKLY IT'S THE BALL PURCHASES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT AND THAT'S WHERE -- THE BAD GUYS DO GET THE GUNS FROM THOSE BOB FOR PURCHASE PURSES SO WE THINK IT'S A PRINTING AND WITH THAT I'LL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND I I THINK THE THE REASON I ASK THE OPPOSITION ABOUT. NGUYEN SUPREME COURT WOULD RULE ON I USED TO WORK REGULATED. THEY MAY BE USED TO WRITE RESTRICTED UP BUT WHATEVER. I TO TELL ALL ABOUT THE SAME -- THE SECOND MINUTE TALK ABOUT REGULATED MILITIA SO -- I THINK RIGHT NOW TODAY -- BASED ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT WE HAVE THAT. ABILITY TO REGULATE -- HOW WE OPERATE WITH OUR OUR GUN SALES AND IN USE? AND SO CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING AND I ON SB SIXTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. CHEN SIR I LACKEY LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAND BACKHAND HI MATHIS. MATHIS NO KAMLAGER-DOVE OF KAMLAGER-DOVE OF NOT VOTING QUIRK. QUIRK I SANTIAGO [inaudible] WICKS. DON'T CALL NEEDS. TO THANK YOU NEXT. SB. ONE SEVENTY TWO YES. ONE SEVENTY TWO ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB. ONE SEVENTY TWO HAS MANY FACTORS WITHIN THE BILL ALL RELATED TO INSURING FIREARMS ARE PROPERLY LOCKED AND STORED. IMPROPER STORAGE OF FIREARMS IN THE HOME FRANKLY ARE KILLING OUR YOUTH THE MASS MAJORITY VAST MAJORITY OF ACCIDENTAL FIREARM DEATH SUICIDE SENSELESS ACTS OF VIOLENCE. AMONG CHILDREN RELATED EASY ACCESS TO FIREARMS EXPANDING ON CHILD ACCESS PREVENTION -- LAWS WILL LOWER RATES OF UNINTENTIONAL FIREARM DEATHS AMONGST OUR YOUTH. AS BE. ONE SEVENTY TWO WOULD AUTHORIZE THE TEMPORARY TRANSFER OF A FIREARM WITHOUT A FIREARMS DEALER PARTICIPATION A PERSON WHO IS EIGHTEEN YEARS. OF AGE OR OLDER FOR SAFE KEEPING TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED -- IN A SUICIDE ATTEMPT -- IT ALSO MAKES THE CURRENT CRIME OF CRIMINAL STORAGE APPLICABLES TO THE STORAGE OF AN UNLOADED AS WELL AS LOADED FIREARM. THE BILL WOULD PLACE ON THE TEN YEAR PROHIBITION LIST PERSONS CONVICTED OF THIS CRIME WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM OWNING A FIREARM OR AMMUNITION FOR THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD. I KNOW IT'S BEEN RAISED BY AT LEAST ONE COMMITTEE MEMBER ABOUT. OVER BURDENING THE SYSTEM AND THAT IT'S A VALID QUESTION TO TO ASK AND I WOULD COMMENT THAT I KNOW -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER K. HANDS -- COMPANION LEGISLATION -- THAT'S MOVING THROUGH THE SENATE I HELPS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AND ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS BY DEALING WITH -- THE WERE JUST ONE ON MY HEAD -- THE APPS AND ALSO -- POWER OF ATTORNEY ISSUES TO HELP STREAMLINE THAT AND MAKE SURE THE OJ CAN PROPERLY PROCESS THESE THINGS SO IT'S THE RIGHT QUESTION ASK AND I'M GLAD THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS THE SOLUTION -- CURRENT LAW ALSO MAKES IT A CRIME TO KEEP A HAND GUN WITHIN THE PROMISE OF A KNOWLEDGE THAT A CHILD -- PERSON PROHIBITED FROM PROFESSING OF POSSESSING A FIREARM IS LIKELY TO GAIN ACCESS IF THE CHILD OR PROHIBITED PERSON OBTAINS ACCESS TO THE HANDGUN AND CARRIES IT OFF PROMISES. I SB ONE SEVEN TWO WOULD MAKE THIS CRIME APPLICABLES ALL TYPES OF FIREARMS AGAIN THE QUESTION'S BEEN RAISED ABOUT THAT AND CURRENTLY IT APPLIES TO HAND GUNS BUT NOT. TOO LONG GUNS AND SOME OTHER NECESSITY FOR THE BILL CURRENT LAW MAKES IT A CRIME FOR OWNERS OF LEGAL -- OR LEGAL OCCUPANT OF A RESIDENTS TO STORE FIREARM IN THAT RESIDENTS IF THE PERSON KNOWS ANOTHER PERSON RESIDING IN THAT RESIDENTS IS A PROHIBITED PERSON PROPOSED. POSSESSING A FIREARM UNLESS THE FIREARM IS SECURED THE BILL WOULD PUT THIS CRIME ON THE TEN THE LIST AS WELL -- THE KEEP OUR SENIOR SAY FACT -- WAS ALSO PART OF THIS WHICH WOULD REQUIRE REGULATIONS. TO FOR PROCEDURES FOR A FIREARM AND AMMUNITION TO BE CENTRALLY STORED IN A LOCK ON SAFE WITHIN A REDSHIRT RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY -- WHICH IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A FACILITY TO PREPARE AND MAINTAIN INDIVIDUAL WEAPONS INVENTORY. PRE CHARM AND THE TYPE OF AMMUNITION STORED WITHIN THE FACILITY AND SUBMIT THOSE INVENTORIES TO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE HERE TO TESTIFY MONICA MILLER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES. AND AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF THE BRADY UNITED CAMPAIGN. OUR AGAIN AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA -- SO SB ONE SIFT SEVENTY TWO STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING SAFE STORAGE LAWS WOULD MAKE THE LAWS ARE CURRENTLY APPLY. TO A LOADED. FIREARM TO APPLY TO UNLOADED FIREARMS AS WELL -- IN ALSO WOULD REQUIRE -- IF THE HAND AND THAT'S NOT CLOSE OFF PRATT PROMISES OF PIPELINE ANY FIREARM AS YOU HEARD. THIS IS SIT STAY SAFE STORAGE IN THE HOME REQUIREMENTS AND FINALLY WOULD OPPOSE IMPOSE A TEN YOUR FIREARM PROHIBITION AND THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE SAFE STORAGE LAWS WHICH ARE TO KEEP. FIREARMS WHETHER LOADED OR NOT WHETHER HANDGUN OR LONG GONE. AWAY FROM CHILDREN AND FROM PEOPLE WHO RESIDE IN THE HOME WHO ARE PROHIBITED -- FROM HAVING ACCESS TO FIREARMS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT APPROXIMATELY 65% OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THE ATTACK REQUIRED THE GUN FOR HIS FROM HIS OR HER HOME OWN HOME OR THAT OF A RELATIVE. FOR THESE REASONS THE LOS ANGELES BLUE RIBBON PANEL ON SCHOOL SAFETY RECOMMENDS THAT STATE LAW MAKE FAILURE TO SIX SAFELY SICKER FIREARM BASIS FOR PROHIBITING A PERSON FROM OWNING A FIREARM. AGAIN IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IF SOMEONE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE WITH THEIR FIREARMS SAFE STORAGE IN THE BREAKING THE LAW IN THAT REGARD. THAT -- A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCES A TEMPORARY FARM PROHIBITION -- AND THEN FINALLY THAT -- THE LAW THIS ACTUALLY WEAKENS EXISTING LAW REGARDING -- LANDING OF OF OF A FIREARM -- WHEN THERE'S A RISK OF SUICIDE? ALL RIGHT NOW WITH SOMEONE WHO IS AT RISK OF SUICIDE IF A FAMILY MEMBER WANTS TO GET THE GUN OUT OF THE HOME -- AND THEY GIVE IT TO A FRIEND TO SIFT SECURE STORE SAFELY THEY WOULD BE RAPED BREAKING THE LAW ALL THE SUICIDE PREVENTION LITERATURE OUT THERE SAYS WHEN THERE'S A RISK OF SUICIDE. GET THE GUN OUT OF THE HOME GIVE IT TO A TRUSTED FRIEND OR RELATIVE WE'RE HAPPY TELLING HIM TO BREAK THE LAW -- BY THAT BY THAT MESSAGING -- AND SO THEREFORE THERE NEEDS TO BE THIS EXEMPTION ALLOWING. A FRIEND OF SOMEONE A TRUSTED FRIEND TO STORE THE FIREARM AS LONG AS THEY MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS -- SUCH THE SECURING IT -- IT'S SECURE STORAGE AND THE HAVING THE FIREARM UNLOADED AND SO WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT SUICIDE PROVENCHER PREVENTION MEASURE I JUST MIGHT REMIND YOU THAT OVER HALF THE GUN DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR PRICE SUICIDE -- AND THEN THE RELATION THAT PROVISION RELATED TO THE REDS RESIDENTIAL pI'LL TURN THAT OVER TO YOU. BUT WE ARE AT YOUR SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MONICA MILLER REPRESENTING CAR WHICH I'M CONSUMER ADVOCATES FOR OUR C. F. E. REFORM ON THE WHAT THOSE ARE IS A RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES. THAT WERE CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND THEIR INTENDED TO BE A HOME. SET HOME BASED SETTING SO WHEN YOU HAVE A GRANDFATHER A MOTHER AND UNCLE SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE CHECKING INTO A FACILITY. AT THEIR NON MEDICAL BUT WE DO HAVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THOSE FACILITIES THAT HAVE ON ALZHEIMER'S ARE ALL DAMAGED RELATED DEMENTIA. AND SO ON THERE'S NO REGULATION REGARDING HOW YOU STORE THEIR FIREARMS THEY CAN BRING ANYTHING THEY WANT INTO THAT FACILITY BECAUSE IT'S THEIR HOME ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE RENTING A ROOM. IN SOMEONE'S HOME TO YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN THERE POTENTIALLY YOU'VE GOT CARE GIVERS YOU GOT FAMILY VISITING SO THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BRING IN THEIR FIRE AND THAT THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY HAVE THIS FIRE ARMS ON PREMISES THEY ARE STORED PROPERLY AND SAFELY SO THERE AREN'T. ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH SOCIAL WORKERS ETCETERA WERE WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE CARE LICENSING DIVISION NOW TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS BILL THAT IT MAKES SENSE. THAT THEIR SOCIAL WORKERS ARE SAFE WHEN THEY GOING TO DO THE CHECKS AND SO FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR AYE ABOUT TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU -- ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION -- SUPPORT I'M SORRY SUPPORT. I WAS LOOKING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH ASPEN US ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. CALVIN QUICK VERY STERN ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT. AND NOW ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THRILLER FOR THE RECORD AND RE WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. FOR STUFF ONE OF START OFF BY I THINK THAT THE SUICIDE PREVENTION ELEMENT ALLOWING THAT EXEMPTION. NOT CASES IS A GREAT THING AND THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR OPPOSITION HINGED ON THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE REPEATEDLY BROUGHT UP -- IN VARIOUS HEARINGS AS THERE IS EFFORTS TO EXPAND BACKGROUND CHECKS INCLUDING THE THIRTY DAY CATCH ALL PROVISION THAT USED TO ALLOW. FOR FIREARMS TO BE STORED FOR OUR LOAN FOR ANY PURPOSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA UP UNTIL A COUPLE YEARS AGO SO -- OUR OUR OPPOSITION IS HINGED ON THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO TO FARM STORAGE -- AND THE THE PENALTIES THAT ARE ARE. THIS BASS WERE YOU CAN LOSE YOUR RIGHTS FOR UP TO TEN YEARS FOR THIS. MISDEMEANOR INFRACTION THIS IS. THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH COULD RENDER FARMS -- USELESS ARE UNAVAILABLE IN SELF DEFENSE SITUATIONS WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC -- FURTHER ON THE ELDER CARE FACILITIES -- THE THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS BILL ARE PRETTY ARDUOUS -- STORING AMMUNITION SEPARATELY FROM FARMS ARE FIRING PINS BEING PULLED OUT OF FARMS IT'S IT'S VERY TECHNICAL THERE'S A LOT OF LIABILITY THAT A FACILITIES GONNA TAKE ON ON BY DOING THIS IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE IT'S DISCOURAGING. THEM FROM DOING THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO -- WITH THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAMPRAS AND UP I WANT TO BRING UP. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS ISSUE THAT TENDS TO BE MY MY DRUM -- HELLER VERSES UNITED STATES THE FOUNDATIONAL RULING OF THAT WAS THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD NOT REQUIRE. RESIDENTS OF HOMES TO KEEP THEIR GUNS [inaudible] DISASSEMBLED. LOCKED OR OR STORED IN A MANNER THAT THEY ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO THEM. FOR PROTECTION IN THE HOME THAT'S WHAT HELLER SAID THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND ALL OF THAT STUFF THAT WAS IN ADDITION BUT THAT WAS THE FOUNDATION OF THE LAWSUIT. MCDONALD VERSUS CHICAGO A YEAR AND A HALF LATER CAME BACK AND SAID THAT. RULING IN THAT RIGHT IS SO. IMPORTANT TO ORDERED LIBERTY THAT NOT A ON ONLY -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD NOT INFRINGE ON THAT RIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY WELL YOU KNOW THE SAMPLE CITY SAN FRANCISCO CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO -- HAS A STATE STORAGE LAW THAT WAS TAKEN ALL OVER THE SUPREME COURT THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED NOT TO TAKE THAT CASE. THAT DOESN'T SET PRECEDENT BY NOT TAKING THE CASE. THE RULING ON HELLER AND MCDONALD STILL STAND. AND GIVEN THAT -- THE SUPREME COURT APPEARS TO BE READY. TO ISSUE A RULING GIVEN -- GOVERNING. LEVEL OF SCRUTINY. I THINK THAT IS THEIR WAY OF SAYING OKAY ALL OF THESE OTHER CASES ARE GOING TO BE HANDLED THEMSELVES. ON A LOCAL LEVEL SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STORAGE. VISIONS OF THIS LAW IN THIS THAN THE STORAGE LAWS ON THE BOOKS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE INHERENTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACCORDING TO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. FOR THESE AND ALL THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES WE'RE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAPITALIZE REPRESENT THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE DO SUPPORT THE SUICIDE PREVENTION WERE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE. OUR MAJOR OBJECTION IS TO THE TEN YEAR PROBATION AND THE GOOD SENATOR MENTIONED AB TWELVE NINETY TWO WHEN WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THAT BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MORE MATURE MEN MEMBERS WERE GOOD FOR THEM TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA RIVAL PISTOL ASSOCIATION WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. THERE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. REBEKAH ARCADIA THANK YOU AND WHAT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. THE COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT ARE WORKING TO PASS A STORAGE ORDINANCES BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE IT IS A STATE. AND TWO CITIES HAVE PASSED IT OTHERS ARE WORKING ON IT BUT THE PATCHWORK IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE COMPLICATED I THINK THEN ASKED STEPPING UP AND DOING IT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. AS A MOTHER I KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FIREARMS ONE OF THE GREATEST RISKS THAT MY KIDS FACE IS ON PLAY DATES WHERE THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER AND UNLOCKED. AND FIREARM THAT IS LOADED AND SO I'M NOT CRAZY MOM WHO ASKS BEFORE MY KIDS GOING TO PLAY DATE. BUT I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP KIDS SAFE IN THE HOME BECAUSE THAT IS OUR JOB. AND AS TO THE OPPOSITION'S POINT ONE OF THE CITY COUNCILS THAT IN AN A PASSING ONE OF THESE ORDINANCES. ONE OF THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO IS A GUN OWNER HAD CONCERNS ABOUT HER ABILITY TO ACCESS HER FIREARMS WAS LOCKED. AND THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE PUSHING FOR IT GAVE HER A TRIGGER LOCK AND SAID WOULD YOU JUST GO HOME AND TRY THIS. AND SHE WENT HOME AND IN THE DARK JUNGLE IT'S OFF LIKE SHE WAS ASLEEP SHE COULD UNLOCK THAT GUN SO QUICKLY THAT SHE ENDED UP VOTING FOR THE ORDINANCE. SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS DOES HAMPER THE ABILITY TO ACCESS A FIREARM JUST BECAUSE IT'S LOCKED WE HAVE. SUCH AMAZING TECHNOLOGY THESE DAYS WHERE YOU COME AGAIN USING YOUR FINGERPRINT IN A SECOND AND SO I JUST THINK. THAT THIS DOESN'T HAMPER ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND WE HAVE LIVES AT RISK AND SO WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS -- I WOULD LOVE TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR AND I HOPE EVERYONE SUPPORTS. THANK YOU YES. I TO WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IN ADDING TO THE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAVING. AROUND GUN VIOLENCE AND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION -- UNFORTUNATELY I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ADDING ADDITIONAL CRIMES TO OUR LIST -- AND THE PENAL CODE AND ALSO JUST HAVE SOME -- CONCERNS AROUND ADDITIONAL -- PROHIBITIONS THAT -- WE ARE -- PLACING -- ON VARIOUS CIVIL LIBERTIES -- THAT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT COME TO THIS COMMITTEE THEM BUT I DID WANT TO JUST SORT OF THIS STATE THAT BECAUSE I GENERALLY DON'T -- GET INTO THAT WHEN WE'RE HAVING OUR YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU [inaudible] MR COURT. SOMEONE TO CLARIFY SOMETHING WHEN. I WOULD SAY THAT THE THREE OF US IF YOU'RE SPOKE AND READ THIS BILL. AND FELT THAT IT APPLIED TO RESIDENTS AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES IN TALKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF. THEY THINK THE BELL ONLY RECALL. ON STORAGE IT ONLY REPLIES. IT ONLY APPLIES TO RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES COULD YOU -- ELABORATE THAT BECAUSE I AM THOUGHT TO BUILD REQUIRE. APPLY TO ALL STORAGE. IS IT ONLY FOR RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES NOW THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES WE'RE CREATING A REGULATORY -- ENVIRONMENT AND THEN FOR RESIDENCES WERE OKAY SAID THEIR OWNERS YEAH THERE WOULD APPEAR TO BE A DIFFERENCE [inaudible] BETWEEN WHAT. SO HOW COULD COMMITTEE OUR STAFF. A PINE ON THIS -- IT DOES THE ARM DOES THIS REQUIRE DOES THE STORAGE REQUIREMENT AT OR I WOULD SAY CONSEQUENCE. APPLY TO ALL RESIDENTS OR SIMPLY RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE BILL THE RESIDENTIAL STORAGE FACILITY. THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITY ELEMENT -- CREATES A STANDARD. AND THEN THERE IS AT THE SEPARATE -- STORAGE CRIME THAT WILL PUT YOU ON THE TEN YEAR PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST THAT'S UNRELATED TO THE CARE FACILITY. ELEMENT OF THE BILL OKAY SO I MISUNDERSTOOD STAFF THANK YOU -- I HAVE CONCERNS NOT THAT IT ISN'T LOGICAL TO DO THIS BUT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE ALREADY ON THE LIST. THAT YOU WOULD BE ADDING MORE AND IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE AND I BELIEVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE HAS THE SAME CONCERN. THAT WE ALREADY HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THE LIST YOU CAN'T HAVE GUNS AND THEY'RE BEING -- THE ENFORCEMENT IS IS NOT OCCURRING AND WE'RE JUST ADDING MORE PEOPLE TO THE LIST. ON THE LIST THAT'S TOO LONG ALREADY. THAT'S MY CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I WISH YOU WOULD RECONSIDER THAT PART AT THE BELL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A CLOSE THANK YOU -- I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BUT I KNOW SUPREME COURT JUSTICES I IN THE PAST HAVE OPINED. ON A NARROW FOCUS WHEN KIDS ARE INVOLVED I THINK EVEN BRETT KAVANAUGH AS CONSERVATIVE AS HE IS HAS. A STATED HIS VIEWS THAT -- THERE IS A ROLE TO BE PLAYED AS FAR AS REGULATING FIREARMS WHEN CHILDREN SAFETIES INVOLVED IN I THINK AND JUSTICE SCALIA'S WELL OPINED ON THAT -- A VERY CLEARLY AND I THINK WE FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY -- IN RELATION TO MR QUIRKS COMMON SIDE I DO BELIEVE THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER K. HANDS -- COMPANION PIECE WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THAT. TO MOST OF THOSE CONCERNS AND HELP THIS BE MORE OFFICIALLY -- IMPLEMENTED SO I I THINK -- I STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT EFFORT AND I THINK THAT WILL HELP -- CLEAR THAT PIECE UP -- WE THINK THIS IS A LOGICAL EXTENSION YOU KNOW IF YOU. MISS USE YOUR CAR. YOU CAN LOSE THE RIGHT. TO HAVE YOUR CAR IF YOU -- BREAK OTHER LAWS YOU YOU YOU. KNOW IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN WHEN YOU'RE NOT BEING RESPONSIBLE. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SAY IF YOU'RE A GUN OWNER YOU BETTER BE RESPONSIBLE ANY BETTER MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS -- AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WE WILL [inaudible] OKAY. SO THAT WAS AGO OKAY SO -- LOOK THERE THERE'S SOME AND WE HADN'T ANOTHER CENTER THAT WAS ADDING TO THE APPS LISTS WHO DID PRESENT TODAY BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT ADDING TODAY. TODAY ABSOLUTE SO I I THINK YOU NEED TO RESOLVE THAT WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF OF WEEK GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE I THINK YOU GO TO HUMAN SERVICES AND PROBES WHERE. SOME PROPRIOCEPTION JUST CAN BE MADE OR CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED -- IF GETS OUT HERE SO HOPING THAT WE GET THROUGH THIS AND THAT YOU ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY PROVEN TO BE CONSISTENT. WITH WHAT WE TOLD OTHERS ABOUT THE APPS -- LIST WE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT. I TO GETTING FUNDING. OR GETTING COMMITMENTS FROM THE AG THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE ADDITIONAL. WORKLOAD -- WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND SO THE CHAIRS WRECK IN MANY IN AYE VOTE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME URTHER DISCUSSION ON THE APPS PART ABSOLUTELY. HONESTY ONE SEVENTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAND PACKING HAD AYE MATHIS [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE NOT VOTING QUIRK. I FOR TODAY. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO I WICKS WICKS I THAT MEASURE PASSES SO WE HAVE ONLY TEN MORE MINUTES BECAUSE WE HAVE BUT WE HAVE A HARD CLOSE I'M SORRY MR WINNER. AND WHICH MEANS WE'LL BE COMING BACK AT FOUR O'CLOCK. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY IN PERTH PEOPLE FUNDS I PERSONALLY APOLOGIZE. TO A BUT I'M NOT EVEN SURE WILL BE ABLE TO FINISH WITH MR PORTANTINO'S. IN THAT CASE CAN I DO -- SIX TWENTY BECAUSE I HAVE THE PASADENA POLICE TO FEAR AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THEIR FLIGHTS BACK. AND THEN WE'LL TRY TO GET. THREE SEVENTY SIX IN KEEP IT SHORT. I WILL TRY TO KEEP IT SHORT THANK YOU MAN [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB SIX TWENTY WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE SPECIFIED LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO FURNISH LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSON ON SUPERVISED RELEASE WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION -- TO CITIES COUNTIES AND NONPROFIT PROVIDERS OF THOSE SERVICES THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE PERSON ON SUPERVISED RELEASE TO BE NOTIFIED. THAT THEIR INFORMATION MAY BE RELEASED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND ALLOW THOSE PERSONS TO OPT IN TO HAVING THEIR INFORMATION RELEASE LET'S VERY IMPORTANT NO ONE'S INFORMATION WOULD BE RELEASED WITHOUT. THAT PERSON'S PERMISSION WHEN SOMEONE IS RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION THE RETURN TO THEIR CITY OF RESIDENCE WITHOUT GUIDANCE OR THE NEEDED RESOURCES FRANKLY TO GET. THEIR LIFE ON OUT BACK ON TRACK WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RECIDIVISM RATES IN THE WORLD IN LOSS OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY 45407%. OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO RETURN FROM INCARCERATION REPEAT OFFEND AND ARE RE INCARCERATED WITHIN THREE YEARS. THIS RESULTS IN A PREDICTABLE PREVENTABLE -- COMMITTEE VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHAT WE RAISE OUR CHILDREN AND CERTAINLY DOES NOT HELP THAT PERSON RELEASED. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE A DATA AND THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EVERY PAROLE LEE AND POST RELEASE COMMITTEE SERVICE -- PROBATIONER HOWEVER THEY CANNOT CONNECT THESE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE RELEASE THIS INFORMATION AS A CANNOT CONNECT THOSE PREVIOUS INCARCERATED DIRECTLY WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT CAN HELP. IT'S HARD TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF RECIDIVISM BY HAVING CONTACT INFORMATION OF THOSE RETURNING TO SOCIETY. FOCUSING THEIR EFFORTS AND GRANT FUNDS ON PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE THINK IT WOULD HELP THOSE INDIVIDUAL SUCCEED AND FRANKLY NOT RE OFFEND. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THOSE ARE LEAVING PRISON HAVE A GREATER ACCESS TO CASE MANAGEMENT FINANCIAL LITERACY MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND IMPORTANT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES WITH ME TODAY I HAVE PASADENA POLICE CHIEF. JOHN PRESENT LIEUTENANT -- JASON CLAWSON AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE. CHIEF. YES SIR THANK YOU SO PASADENA STARTED THIS EFFORT OVER TEN YEARS AGO ON A GRASSROOTS. A WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WHEN NO BUDGET NO MONEY AND JUST USING NON PROFITS IN IN A VERY SHORT NARRATIVE HERE OVER TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN SUCCESS WERE REINTEGRATION IT'S NOT RE ENTRY WHICH IS A CALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. REINTEGRATION MEANS TO START OVER WITH A STRATEGY NOT SIMPLY START OVER SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE OUR RECIDIVISM ON THE TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH OUR PROGRAM HERE IN THE COMMUNITY. IN PASADENA TO SEVEN POINT 5% BUT IT'S TAKEN US TEN YEARS TO GET THERE WE BELIEVE THIS IS A START POINT A GAME CHANGER FOR US TO CONNECT NONPROFIT IN OUR COMMUNITY. USING PROBATION AND THE B. S. C. C. AS WELL THAT HAVE -- SYSTEMS IN PROGRAMS THAT COULD WORK AT THE ONSET OF RELEASE FROM PRISON IS THE BEST TIME SOMEBODY WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE IT'S THE BEST TIME TO CATCH HIM TO OPT IN. INTO A PROGRAM. THANK YOU. BUT THAT IT. OKAY AND ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. ANY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DANIELS [inaudible] GOOD -- GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA. REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION I DO WANT TO A NOTE OUR OUR SHARED A COMMON GROUND ON THE SPIRIT OF THIS BILL -- AND CERTAINLY WE SHARE THE THE EFFORTS OF THE SENATOR AND OF THE CHIEF HERE TODAY -- WHERE ARE CONCERNED STEM FROM IS REALLY THE MECHANISMS WITHIN THE BILL AND APPROACH AS IT RELATES TO CONNECTING -- PEOPLE ON SUPERVISED RELEASE TO THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES -- THE THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN MANY WAYS OF PROBATION IS TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO THOSE COMING OUT OF BOTH PRISON -- ON PEER CS THOSE COMING OUT OF JAIL ON MANDATORY SUPERVISION AND THOSE ON A PROBATION WITH US TO ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT THIS BILL SEEKS WHAT WE'RE VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE DONE OVER. THE LAST MANY MANY YEARS IS REALLY FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL LIES NATURE OF WORKING WITH OFFENDERS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL JUSTICERESEARCH ON RISK NEEDS RESPONSIVITY. THAT TALKS ABOUT THE NEED TO NOT JUST CONNECT PEOPLE TO ANY SERVICE BUT TO CONNECT THEM TO SERVICES THAT BOTH ADDRESS THEIR CRIMINAL -- CRIMINAL GENIC NEEDS AND ALSO THE RIGHT -- SERVICES -- PROBATION WORKS IN CONCERT WITH THE COURT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SERVICES THAT. ARE PROVIDED ARE ALSO IN LINE WITH THEIR CONDITIONS OF PROBATION AND THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF RISK NEEDS ASSESSMENT CASE PLANNING AND AND REALLY INTRICATE THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ARE NOT GONNA BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ALLOWING. FOR A THESE PERSON TO BE CONNECTED -- WITHOUT ALL OF THOSE FACTORS KIND OF BROUGHT INTO INTO BEAR SO -- WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS BUT FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSE TODAY. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WHEN THIS IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] WHO? QUESTION. YEAH CAN I CHEST AT CENTER PORTANTINO TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I'M IMAGINING THAT THERE'S QUITE. IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF THESE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND IF ONE WERE TO PUT ON A RELEASE AND ALL THIS AND THEY'RE ALL FLOODING YOU. YOU KNOW. DOES THAT BENEFITS SOMEONE HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THIS IS BENEFITING PEOPLE TO GET. THE INFORMATION FROM THE SOUTH I WOULD SAY ON THE BIG PICTURE OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LA COUNTY THAT 47% AND PASADENA PT'S AT 7%. RECIDIVISM RATE. IT'S WORK AND BUT IN THE SPECIFIC I LET THE LIEUTENANT ADDRESS THE SPECIFICS BECAUSE HE'S DEALING DIRECTLY WITH PROBATION SO I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR TEN YEARS MY NAME IS JEFF LAWSON WITH PASADENA PLEASE. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR OVER TEN YEARS -- WELL WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH PROBATION -- FOR SOME REASON PROBATION WON'T TAKE ALL THESE PEOPLE TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS -- THAT ARE PROVIDING SERVICES -- WE ARE THE RECIPIENT OF A GRANT FROM THE BUREAU STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS -- TO WHERE WE TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS ARE BEING FUNDED DIRECTLY TOWARDS OF RECIDIVISM EFFORTS AND PART OF OUR PROGRAM IS NOT JUST JOB SKILLS FINANCIAL LITERACY WE'RE BRINGING PEOPLE IN FOR COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. RAPID ID SENSE OF A PATIENT AND THESE ARE ALL YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF WORK FROM WHEN WE APPLIED FOR THIS GRANT MONEY FROM THE STATE. THIS IS THE STUFF THAT WE'RE DOING AND IT IS DRIVING DOWN THE RECESS RECIDIVISM RATES GIVING PEOPLE ALTERNATIVES -- TO GOING OUT THERE COMMITTING CRIMES MAKING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS SAFER DRIVING DOWN OUR CRIME RATES AND IT'S PETE IT'S ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK AND I JUST GET A JOB IT'S TO GET CAREERS. NO WE'VE TRIED TO GO OUT THERE IN SOLICIT PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF PRISON MY BADGE WILL TELL THEM ONE THING AND IS A CREDIBILITY ISSUE WITH IT BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M GOING TO RE ARREST THEM. THEY DON'T THINK THAT THE POLICE ARE GOING TO HELP THEM SO BY NEED DIRECTING PEOPLE AND GETTING CASE MANAGERS AND SYSTEM NAVIGATION AND CHASERS TO COME OUT THERE AND GRAB THESE PEOPLE AND BRING THEM INTO THE SERVICES. IT ALLOWS FOR US THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TO HEAL -- FOR INSTANCE IF I KNEW THERE WAS SOMEONE SOMEBODY SUFFERING A MENTAL CRISIS AND I TOLD HEY. GO OVER THERE AND GET SOME HELP THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GO OVER THERE THIS ALLOWED THE PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH THAT I'VE ADDED THAT I'M ALLOWING MIGHT THIS INFORMATION TO GET INTO THEIR HANDS. TO GO OUT AND PHYSICALLY MAKE CONTACT AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN IN PRISON ARE DOING SOME OF THE WORK TOO SO THERE'S A CREDIBILITY ISSUE WITH THEM WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET BACK. ON THEIR FEET AND GET THEIR CAREERS IN ORDER SO WHAT THAT'LL SUBMIT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I HAVE A COMMENT YEAH. YEAH I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY FIRST OF ALL. I THINK THIS I KNOW OUR OWN. TIME WHEN THE SOLDIERS QUICK AS I CAN. BUT I THINK THIS A BIG DEAL. AND I THINK IT PROVIDES A REFRESHING. MODEL FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I DON'T SEE IT AS A AS A THREAT TO A PROBATION I HAVE HIGH RESPECT. FOR I SEE IT AS A SUPPLEMENT AND I THINK THAT -- IT'S AN OPT IN KIND OF SITUATION AND I THINK THAT IT'S A WIN WIN. FOR EVERYONE IN YOUR TO BE COMMENDED YOUR SUCCESS BECAUSE FOR SELF AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND THIS IS EXCITING. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU MAY CLOSE YEAH I THINK IT'S THE THE SUCCESSES WORKING AND I THINK HAVING IT BE PROACTIVE VERSUS REACTIVE AND HAVING IT BE. ON THE GROUND WHERE PEOPLE KNOW THE FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS OF THOSE RELEASED -- PEOPLE I THINK IT'S BEING IT'S WORKING SO AND I DON'T THINK IT'S IT'S AT ALL AN INFRINGEMENT ON PROBATION SO. RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES AND RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL GANGS SO. THIS IS WHAT BOTHERS ME -- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE TWO GREAT PROGRAM TECH POSSIBLY HELP PEOPLE AND WE ACT IS PISSING MATCH GOING ON I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS -- BUT IF IT GETS OTHERS COMMITTEE AND WE GET TO APPROACH. IF PROBATION AND PASADENA POLICE DEPARTMENT CANNOT WORK THIS OUT. THEN I WILL RECOMMEND THAT WE VOTED DOWN OR IT DOESN'T COME OUT OF A PRO. OF BECAUSE THIS IS JUST SILLY. IT'S JUST SILLY BIOPIC YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TWO POINT THREE MILLION YOU GET MONEY. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE BETTER FORM THE INCARCERATED. AND YOU GUYS CAN'T GET LAW YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN FRONT OF US TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT. I DON'T LET ME TO PUT IT THAT WAY BUT TO SUGGEST. THIS IS WHAT FRUSTRATES ME ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT AND ALL THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES BOB. YOU HAVE X. AMOUNT OF DAYS IF YOU DECIDE IS COMMITTEE TO WORK IT OUT THIS PORTANTINO WHEN I'VE ALREADY. WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU? I CITY AUTHOR SO IT'S NOT ANYTHING NEW OR SURPRISING -- SO I'M HOPING. THAT THE TWO CAN CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY THAT YOU'VE BEEN TO BOTH CAN WORK TOGETHER LET'S FACE IT AT THE END OF THE DAY. PROBATION HAS THE AUTHORITY. IF PROBATION SAYS DON'T GO YOUR WAY THAT TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU SEEM TO WANT TO HOLD ONTO A DRY UP. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY HAVE. TO REPORT TO THIS INDIVIDUAL. AND YES THEY CAN USE YOURS ON THE SIDE AND ADD TO IT. BUT IF THEY'RE SO TIED UP WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT PROBATION TELLS HIM TO AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS YOURS. THAT'S A DISSERVICE TO THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO REHABILITATE. AND WE SHOULD WE WORKING TO FIND THE BEST. CONTINUUM OF CARE. PROGRAMS THAT HELP ANYBODY THAT COMES OUT NOT TRYING TO PICK THIS ONE VERSUS THAT ONE SO -- IF IT GETS OUT TODAY LET'S LET'S MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IS THERE A MOTION HELLO HAVE BEEN.

OUR COLLEAGUE SIDE SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY SIX REPEALS A COMMENTING COSTLY ONE YOUR SENTENCING ENHANCEMENT THAT APPLIES FOR EACH PRIOR FELONY PRISON TERM. OR FELONY COUNTY JAIL TERM THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS SERVED. THIS ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT -- REPLENISHES OFFENDERS NOT FOR PRIOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT BUT PER FOR PRIOR INCARCERATION -- BECAUSE IT ONLY APPLIES IF THE PRIOR FELONY RESULTED IN JAIL TIME IT'S IN A RATIONAL ENHANCEMENT -- AND STATISTICS SHOW -- DIE -- PEOPLE OF COLOR IN LOWER INCOME PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY AND THAT PRIOR FELONY TO HAVE SERVED TIME AS OPPOSED TO RECEIVE. PROBATION SO THERE IS SIGNIFICANT IRRATIONAL DISPARITIES IN THIS PARTICULAR ENHANCEMENTS -- WE HAVE A HOT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OTHERS SENSING ENHANCEMENTS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW -- PARTICULARLY FOR VIOLENT AND SERIOUS REPEAT OFFENDERS THERE ARE MUCH MORE SEVERE ENHANCEMENTS IN THIS ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT THIS ONE YOU'RE ENHANCE INTENDS TO BE USED FOR LOW LEVEL -- CRIMES. AND TIME PARTICULARLY I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT OMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ENHANCEMENTS FOR REPEAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REPEAT OUR CHILD ABUSE -- THAT ARE MORE SEVERE OUR COURTS HAVE ALL SORTS OF TOOLS -- TO HAVE PEOPLE INCARCERATED FOR LONGER PERIODS IF THAT IS APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF THE SENTENCING RANGES IN TERMS OF OTHER ENHANCEMENTS TERMS STRIKES WHERE THAT APPLIES. AND SO FORTH -- SO IT'S TIME TO REPEAL THIS ENHANCEMENT WHICH DOES NOTHING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT IS VERY COSTLY -- AND IS NOT NEEDED SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME HERE TODAY OUR TONY WEEKENDS AND GENEVIEVE JONES -- RIGHT A PUBLIC DEFENDER. YES FIVE MINUTES A GOOD MORNING. TOM GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY MY NAME IS TONY WIGGINS I'M A RESIDENT SOUTHEAST SAN DIEGO I'M HERE TODAY INFO SUPPORT THE SENATE TO WIND OF THE BILL. SB ONE THIRTY SIX I PERSONALLY WAS IMPACTED. AND UNDERSTAND THE COMPOUND IT DAMAGES COMPLICATION THAT SENSE AN ENHANCEMENT CALLS AND DEFENSE Là. A NINETEEN NINETY THREE I WAS A I WAS HOMELESS. DRUG ADDICT DROUGHT [inaudible] AND IN UNDER KANZA UNDER KUNDER UNDERCOVER OFFICER -- ASKED ME IF I HAVE SOME GRASS FOR SALE. SO AS A CONSEQUENCE I GAVE HIM SOME GRASS. I HAD SOME PRIOR MARIJUANA CONVICTIONS AND SO I WAS -- I HAD TO OF SPENT TEN YEARS AT 80% DUE TO ENHANCE. SO WHILE SOME ARGUE THAT ONE YEARS AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME SO MANY CRUCIAL DAY'S GONNA HAPPEN A TWELVE MONTH FOR ME. DURING MY INCARCERATION BOTH MY PANTS PASSED AWAY. GRANDPARENTS SOME UNCLES THREE BROTHERS. AND I WAS UNABLE TO BE A WITH HIM IN THE FINAL DAYS AND HAD TO PROCESS THIS GROUP FROM. A HABIT BACK I HAVE BEEN BACK HOME -- CLEAN AND SOBER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS DURING THIS TIME I HAVE BEEN DEEPLY COMMITTED TO GIVING BACK TO MY COMMUNITY. I'M A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION POSTS OF COMMUNITY HAVE FOUND OF A LOCAL RECOVERY PROGRAM FOR ALEX IN OUR COMMUNITY AND ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN MY MáS. AND I VOLUNTEER AT A LOCAL CHURCH FEEDING THOSE LIVING WITH CAPS. I OFTEN WONDER HOW MUCH MORE I COULD HAVE DONE FOR MY COMMUNITY IF I HAVE SIMPLY BEEN A OFFERED RECOVERY INSTEAD OF PRISON. IF I HAD A CHANCE TO BEAT THAT ADDICTION AT A YOUNGER AGE HOW MUCH MORE COULD I HAVE TO A SENSING THAT HAVE SMITH SIMPLY PUNISH INDIVIDUAL FOR PAST CRIMES. IMPRESSION VULNERABLE PEOPLE INTO SIGNING DISPROPORTIONATE PLEA DEALS. I ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO DATE TWO OF VOTE YES ON SB ONE THIRTY SIX OF THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE AWAY FROM PUNITIVE PRACTICES. AND MOVE TOWARD OF RESTORATION JOBS. THANK YOU YES. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JAN IF YOU HAVE JONES RIGHT I AM A DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. IN OUR CURRENT JUSTICE SYSTEM TIME SERVED IS A FALSEHOOD. SB ONE THIRTY SIX RECOGNIZE IS THAT HE BEING MORE PRISON TIME ON PEOPLE'S HEADS SOLELY BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY SERVED TIME IN PRISON MAKES NO SENSE. CRITICS OFSB ONE THIRTY SIX LIKE THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION FALSELY CLAIM THAT THE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF SB ONE THIRTY SIX IS THAT A RECALCITRANT CRIMINAL SHOULD BE SENTENCED THE SAME AS A FIRST TIME OFFENDER DESPITE A LENGTHY CRIMINAL HISTORY. THIS ARGUMENT IGNORES OTHER PROVISIONS THAT PROSECUTORS ARGUE EVERY DAY IN COURT LIKE CALIFORNIA RULE OF COURT FOUR POINT FOUR TWO ONE BI THREE WHICH ALLOWS A JUDGE TO CONSIDER. A PRIOR PRISON TERM AN AGGRAVATING FACTOR TO INCREASE THE DEFENDANT'S SENTENCE. SB ONE THIRTY SIX DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THIS TOOL. NOR THE THREE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS. NOT ONLY ARE THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST SB ONE THIRTY SIX DISINGENUOUS THEY ALSO IGNORE THE REALITY OF ENHANCEMENTS. THESE ENHANCEMENTS DO NOT REDUCE RECIDIVISM THEY ADD TO OUR STATES ALREADY OVERCROWDED PRISONS. IT IS NOW AN OFT CITED STATISTICS THAT IN CALIFORNIA PLEA DEALS. EVERY TIME ONE OF MY CLIENTS ENTER A GUILTY PLEA TO A FELONY CONVICTION WEATHER HERE SHE IS BEING SENTENCED TO PROBATION OR A PRISON TERM. I HAVE TO ADVISE THEM THAT A POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PLEA IS THAT A YEAR IN CUSTODY ABOVE AND BEYOND OF THEIR SENTENCE CAN BE ADDED. FOR EACH PERSON PRIOR IN THE FUTURE. THAT IS BECAUSE IF A PERSON IS REVOKED ON PROBATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY GETS SENTENCED TO PRISON THAT TIME IN CUSTODY WILL ALSO COUNT AS A PRISON PRIOR. IN A LEGAL SYSTEM FRAUGHT WITH INJUSTICES THESE TYPES OF ENHANCEMENTS OR THE PROVERBIAL SALT IN THE WOUND A TOOL FOR PROSECUTORS TO OVER CARCERI BY GETTING A SECOND THIRD AND SOMETIMES EVEN A FOURTH BITE. AT THE APPLE CALIFORNIA CAN DO BETTER THAN RE PUNISHING PEOPLE AND RECHARGING THE TAXPAYER I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE THIRTY SIX THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION.

JIM WHEN BURGER ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA PROUD CO SPONSORS STRONG SUPPORT. HELLO MS BURTON. HELLO READY. RESERVE BURTON FOUNDER OF A NEW WAY OF LIFE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YES COULD YOU MAKE ROOM FOR THEM CHEN NUMBER IS MY NAME'S TYPICALLY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. AND WE ARE IN REGRETTABLE OPPOSITION TO SB. ONE THIRTY SIX UNDER CURRENT LAW THE ONE YOU'RE ENHANCEMENT THAT THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE DOES NOT APPLY TO ANYONE WHO'S CURRENT SENTENCE. OR PRIOR SENTENCE WAS PROBATION. IT DOES NOT APPLY TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOT COMMITTED NEW A NEW FELONY OFFENSE OR WHO HAS REMAINED FREE OF INCARCERATION FOR FIVE YEARS. NOR DOES IT APPLY TO ANYONE WHO'S PRIOR OFFENSES NO LONGER FELONY PURSUANT TO PROP. FORTY SEVEN UNDER EXISTING LAW WHICH KIND OF CRIME WHICH KINDS OF CRIMES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT. THE PERSON CHARGED WITH FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITH THE PREVIOUS FELONY CONVICTION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS FOR CHILD ABUSE. A FELON IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ELDER ABUSE WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION FOR FELONY FALSE IMPRISONMENT. AND FINANCIAL CRIMES TARGETING THE ELDERLY WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION FOR EXTORTION. THESE ARE JUST A FEW THE CRIMES WHERE A JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION. TO IMPOSE A ONE HERE ENHANCEMENT. AND WHY WOULD A JUDGE IMPOSES ENHANCEMENT. BECAUSE THIS PERSON IS CONVICTED OF A SIGNIFICANT FELONY HAVING ALREADY BEEN TO PRISON FOR A SIGNIFICANT FELONY WITHIN THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS. INHERE SOME OTHER CRIMES IN WHICH CURRENT LAW ALLOWS A JUDGE THE DISCRETION TO IMPOSE A ONE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT. THESE ARE ALL FELONIES WERE THE CURRENT OFFENSE IS A SERIOUS OR VIOLENT FELONY BUT THE PRIOR CONVICTION IS CONSIDERED A NON SERIOUS OR NON VIOLENT FELONY. CARJACKING WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION IS FOR ANIMAL CRUELTY. FORCIBLE RAPE WHERE THE DEFENDANT WAS CONVICTED WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS FOR ELDER ABUSE. LEWD ACTS ON A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN WITH THE CONVICTION WITHIN THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS FOR CHILD ENDANGERMENT. INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION FOR FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT MOST OF THE CRIMES DEEMED NON SERIOUS OR NON VIOLENT ARE IN FACT QUITE SERIOUS AND OR QUITE VIOLENT. THESE ARE NOT FIRST TIME FELONS CONVICTED OF POSSESSORY DRUG OFFENSES THESE ARE REPEAT THE FELONY OFFENDERS MANY OF WHOM HAVE COMMITTED ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHERS AND ARE BACK BEFORE JUDGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TARGETED MORE VICTIMS. AFTER ALREADY. HAVING BEEN TO PRISON. CDA IS OFTEN ENCOURAGED TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT GIVE BROADER DISCUSSION TO JUDGES YET THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE BY TAKING AWAY THE DISCRETION OF JUDGES TO EVALUATE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND DETERMINED WHETHER PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED FELON COMMITTING YET ANOTHER FELONY WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF HIS PREVIOUS FELONY SHOULD HAVE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR ADDED TO A SENTENCE. WE TRUST THE JUDGES TO EVALUATE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN A CASE BEFORE THEM AND DECIDE WHETHER THIS REPEAT FELON HAS COMMITTED CRIMES THAT MATTER A ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENT. AND FOR THESE REASONS ROSS FOR KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. YOU SHOW MUCH RB HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. MATT PERSONAL ON BEHALF OF THE SH -- SHERIFF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BUT KAMLAGER-DOVE.
