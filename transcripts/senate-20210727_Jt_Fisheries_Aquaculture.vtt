WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN IT SEEMS

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.393
CLEARLY DESIGNED TO FACILITATE

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.295
EXTINCTION. ALLOWING THREE

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:45.464
YEARS. ONLY THREE YEARS A TOTAL

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.900
SALMON DEATH BEFORE REMEDIAL

THAT THE STATE IS LITIGATING.

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:01.013
IT'S IS OUTRAGEOUS THIS IS

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.982
UNACCEPTABLE AND NOW BECAUSE OF

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.617
THE LACK OF ACTION AND THIS

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:07.553
DROUGHT. IT'S LIKELY GOING TO

I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.863
DROUGHT IS INCREDIBLY TRAGIC

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:17.763
EIGHT CREATES INCREDIBLE

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.498
HARDSHIP IN THE SCIENCE IS

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:20.633
TELLING US THAT WE COULD BE IN

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.102
IT FOR A LONG TIME AND WE HAVE

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.503
TO DO BETTER AND THAT'S WHY WE

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.606
WANTED TO BE A TO BRING THIS

REMOVAL ON THE KLAMATH. THE

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.853
SILVER LINING COMES AS A RIVER

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.154
FACES SOME OF THE MOST.

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.756
TERRIBLE CONDITIONS EVER IN

FISH IS INFECTED WITH HEAT

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:51.397
LOVING PERICYTES. SO HOT THAT

SALMONID CENTER THERE AND WE'VE

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:40.112
SEEN FOR CERTAIN SPECIES THAT

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.147
EXTINCTION LINE MOVED FURTHER

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:42.515
AND FURTHER NORTH SO A LOT OF

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:44.984

SACRAMENTO RIVER WHERE CLEARLY

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:05.771

OTHER EFFECTS TO PROVIDE SOME

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:13.312
REALLY DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:16.015
THE SALMONIDS IN IN CALIFORNIA

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:18.951
SO EVEN AS CLIMATE IS SHIFTING

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.419
AND WE'RE HAVING TO DO A BETTER

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:22.154
JOB OF MANAGING WATERSHEDS AND

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:24.323
RETHINK HOW WATER MOVES THROUGH

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.492
THE SYSTEM TO PROTECT THE FISH

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:28.294

APPROPRIATELY. THESE ARE

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:32.932
DECISIONS THAT WERE BEING

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.433
WORKED ON IN BEING MADE AND

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.968
THAT WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:37.737
DEVASTATING CIRCUMSTANCES COME

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:38.771
TOGETHER INCLUDING

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:41.073
MISMANAGEMENT OF FEDERAL

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.910
POLICY. TO REALLY DRIVE.

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:47.046
FISHERIES POTENTIALLY TO

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:48.481
EXTINCTION WHICH IS REALLY

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.149
FRIGHTENING TO SEE. AND SO A

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:51.217
LOT OF THE STEPS THAT WE'VE

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:53.252
MADE OVER THE YEARS ARE NOW

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.321
BEING ANNOUNCED BY THIS POLICY

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:56.122
AND THEN NOT SURE REALLY WHERE

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:57.656
WE'RE GOING TO GO. BUT IT'S A

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:59.158
CRISIS NOW AND IT'S GOING TO BE

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:01.027
A CRISIS CONTINUING INTO THE

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:02.762
FUTURE WHETHER OR NOT WE

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:05.031
CONTINUE TO HAVE DROUGHT JUST

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:08.100
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE WITH THE

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.368
WATER SHOULD HAVE BEEN MANAGED

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:11.337
AND ABUSED AND MISUSED THE DAMS

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:12.671
THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:14.106
BUT FORTUNATELY NOW ON THE

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:14.673
KLAMATH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.342
TAKING OUT BUT MANAGING

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:18.577
UPSTREAM. TO THE WATERSHEDS

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.112
WERE THE SOURCE OF THE WATER IS

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:21.213
WHAT WE'VE TRADITIONALLY HAD

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.682
COLD WATER COMING DOWN. AND IN

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:25.584
APPROPRIATE VOLUMES COMING DOWN

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.919
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:28.120
FISHERIES THAT'S WHAT WE NEED

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.222
TO. LOOK TO THE FUTURE TO GET

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:31.991
BACK TO YOU SO THAT WE CAN HELP

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:33.859
A FISH THAT HAS BEEN RESILIENT

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.961
AND COMING UP AGAINST THE POINT

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.463
OF NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.232
MANAGE THE- THE CHANGES THAT

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:42.401
ARE MOSTLY MAN MADE THAT OR ARE

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:46.839
COMING DOWN TO THE SAMANIDS. SO

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:47.473
I DON'T THINK THESE REPORTS ARE

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.541

ON JULY SIXTEENTH YOU ASKED ME

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:42.081
TO COVER SPECIFIC TOPICS TODAY.

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.082
I'D LIKE TO WALK THROUGH THAT

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:45.651
LIST AND LET ME BEGIN WITH AN

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.654
OVERALL STATUS. BUT BEFORE I

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.590
JUST WANNA KNOW MY ENTIRE

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:55.427

COMMITTED TO SALMON

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:59.498
CONSERVATION IN THE WEST. IN MY

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.368
CURRENT JOB IN MY PRIOR ROLES

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:03.269
FOR TROUT UNLIMITED THE

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:04.837
NATION'S OLDEST AND LARGEST

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:06.171
SALMON AND TROUT CONSERVATION

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:09.108
ORGANIZATION. ACTUALLY CHOSE MY

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:10.809
LAW SCHOOL BASED ON THE FACT

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:12.311
THAT THE CURRICULA INCLUDED

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:15.347
SALMON LAW. SO THESE ARE TOPICS

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:17.416
THAT VICE CHAIR ARE DIFFICULT

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.451
TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE WE'RE

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:21.920
GRAPPLING WITH SUCH BLEAKNESS.

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:24.556
BUT THESE FISH PROVE US IF WE

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:25.958
GIVE A CHANCE TO THEM BILL

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:27.359
SURVIVED THEIR HEARTY AND

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.161
THEY'RE RESILIENT. IS THE

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:32.431
OVERALL PICTURE IF YOU TAKE THE

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:35.267
LAST TWENTY YEARS. WHAT YOU'LL

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.835
SEE AND TWENTY YEARS OF PRETTY

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.671
GRANULAR DATA WE HAVE ACROSS

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:42.007
THE STATE IS A GENERAL STATE OF

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:44.476
DECLINE FOR SAM FISHER. YOU

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:46.679
LOOK BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.447
YOU GO TO TWENTY TWENTY AND YOU

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:50.516
CAN PLOT OUT IN BAR CHARTS. I'M

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:52.284
UP AND DOWN SOME YEARS THE

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:54.486
POPULATIONS HEADING UP SOME

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.522
YEARS IT'S HEADING DOWN. BUT

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:57.990
GENERALLY OVER THOSE TWENTY

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:00.459
YEARS IT'S ON A LONG TRAJECTORY

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:03.462
DOWNWARD. AND ACROSS THE TWENTY

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:05.698
YEARS AGAIN IS JUST A SNAPSHOT

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:06.699
THERE'S AN EARLIER RECORD IN

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.567
TOWN. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.303
THE YEARS OF TWO THOUSAND SIX

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.271
SEVEN EIGHT NINE IS THE CHAIR

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:12.738
MENTIONED THOSE WERE

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.374
PARTICULARLY. STRONG FIGURES

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:18.977
FOR THE SALMON FISHER WE HAD A

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:22.014
TWO THOUSAND SIX AND SALMON-CRASH. IT GREATLY AFFECTED OUR

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:25.084
COASTAL COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.685
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. AND WHAT

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:29.588
YOU SEE IN THE DATA

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.190
200-011-1213 FOURTEEN WAS THE

00:16:31.256 --> 00:16:33.759
BEGINNING OF A REBOUND. BETTER

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.828
YEARS ACTUALLY END UP TECH OF

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.696
COURSE THAT REBOUND RAN

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:40.399
STRAIGHT INTO OUR LAST ROW

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.468
WHICH WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.403
INCLUDING FOR WHEN A RUN IN THE

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.405
SACRAMENTO RIVER. AND THEN AS

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:47.673
YOU COME OUT OF THAT DROUGHT

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.274
YOU SEE A POPULATION DECLINE

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.443
AGAIN IN THE DATA SIXTEEN

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.611
SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN. WHICH

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:55.647
YOU ACTUALLY SEE AS WE GET INTO

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:56.181
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:58.617
TWENTY UP. AND IN FACT I'LL

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.486
TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT. A LOT

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:02.621
OF THE RETURNS TO OUR RIVERS

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.623
THIS YEAR ARE HIGHER. THAN

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.025
EXPECTED. BUT OF COURSE THIS

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:08.961
REBOUND HAS RUN INTO THE

00:17:09.027 --> 00:17:11.363
CURRENT DROUGHT. AND I THINK

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.831
THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN MESSAGES

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:14.900
I WOULD ONE UNDERSCORE WHAT

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.569
WORRIES ME GREATLY. IS OUR

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:19.638
SPECIES PARTICULARLY AQUATIC

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.273
DEPENDENT TRASH BUT THERE ARE

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.243
TERRESTRIAL AQUATIC SPECIES.

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:26.545
ARE LOSING THE ABILITY TO

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:28.680
RECOVER THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN

00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:30.516
VERY ABILITY IN CALIFORNIA.

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:32.785
WITH OUR HYDRO GRASS BUT ALSO

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:35.421
OUR SPECIES HAD SPACE TO

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.790
RECOVER AND REBUILD. AND WHAT I

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:40.225
THINK MAY BE OCCURRING IS THAT

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:42.694
SPACE FOR RECOVERY TO REBALANCE

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:44.730
IS REALLY BEING DRAMATICALLY

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:47.032
ALTER. AND THIS IS WHERE I

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:50.135
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUT- THE

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:51.136
BROADER CONTEXT IN PLAY. DON'T

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:54.072
FORGET WHAT WE ARE LIVING FOR.

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:55.174
THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.309
CALIFORNIA SOME ARE SUGGESTING

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:58.977
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MEGA

00:17:59.044 --> 00:18:00.779
DROUGHT WE NEVER LAST LEFT THE

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:03.816
LAST ROUTE. SOME HAVE SAID THE

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.484
CURRENT PERIOD OF DRYNESS IN

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:07.986
THE WEST. MAY EVENTUALLY RIVAL

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:09.621
THE DRYNESS OF THE INFAMOUS

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:12.991
SMALL. DROUGHT RIGHT NOW IS

00:18:13.058 --> 00:18:16.261
AFFECTING 96% OF SEVEN WESTERN

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:20.098
STATES ARIZONA CALIFORNIA IDAHO

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:21.200
MONTANA NEVADA OREGON

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.135
WASHINGTON THAT'S THE HIGHEST

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:26.038
EVER COMBINED PERCENT SINCE

00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:26.572
THEY'VE BEEN KEEPING THAT

00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:29.007
METRIC. LAKE MEAD AND THE

00:18:29.074 --> 00:18:31.543
COLORADO RIVER SYSTEM WHICH IS

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.545
THE NATION'S LARGEST RESERVOIR

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:36.415
IS JUST 35% OF CAPACITY WHICH

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:38.484
IS THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE IT

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.787
WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT IN

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:42.754
NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE. WE ALL IN

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:44.790
EARLY JULY JUST LIVED THROUGH A

00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:46.792
SHE BLOOMED ACROSS THE ENTIRE

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:50.529
WEST. WHICH EXPERTS THIS

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:53.165
EXCEEDED THE STANDARD METHODS

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.234
OF EVALUATION. AND ALLOW

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.336
PORTLAND WAS A HUNDRED AND

00:18:57.402 --> 00:18:59.271
EIGHTEEN DEGREES AND IN THAT

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:02.241
SAME SPACE DEATH VALLEY IT ONE

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.009
HUNDRED AND THIRTY AGAIN WHICH

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.811
IS ARGUABLY THE HOTTEST

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:07.579
TEMPERATURE EVER RECORDED ON

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:10.449
THE PLANT. SURE YOU'VE LIVED

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:11.717
THERE WHILE FAR MUCH MORE

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:13.285
PERSONALLY AND DRAMATICALLY

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:16.922
THEN BE. AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.423
WE FOUGHT FOR FIVE OF OUR

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.192
BIGGEST WILDFIRES AT THE SAME

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.494
TIME TO DO THIS YEAR WE'VE

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:23.128
ALREADY HAD MORE WILDFIRES THAN

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:26.031
LAST YEAR. SO THE STATISTIC

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.567
THAT MOSTLY HAS ALTERED MY OWN

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:30.602
MENTAL CAPACITY TO THINK ABOUT

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.437
THE SITUATION RANDY. IS

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.072
ACTUALLY RELATED TO A DIFFERENT

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:35.874
VARIABLE. THE DRYNESS OF OUR

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:39.478
STORE. WE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:41.413
SOMETHING WHICH I THINK IT'S

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.482
ACTIVELY WAS OUR SNOWPACK

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.717
VANISHING. OVER THE MONTHS OF

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.986
APRIL AND MAY. WE WENT INTO

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:50.455
APRIL ONE OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.357
LOOKING AT THE DATA ACCUMULATED

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:54.126
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

00:19:54.192 --> 00:19:54.626
RESOURCES NEBRASKA AGING

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.396
NETWORK. THAT MOMENT THE SNOW

00:19:57.462 --> 00:20:00.432
PACK IN THE SIERRA WAS WHAT

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:03.769
THEY CALL 59% OF OUR- BY MAY

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:06.471
ONE IT WAS 22% OF AVERAGE. BY

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:10.208
JUNE WANTED WAS ZERO. ALMOST

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:10.776
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:13.612
FEET IN THAT TIME FRAME WHICH

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:16.582
IS N. AS PAUL ROGERS WROTE IN

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:17.215
THE MERCURY NEWS AT THE END OF

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:20.018
JUNE MORE THAN 40% OF THE WATER

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:22.187
THAT LOS ANGELES CITY USES IN A

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.523
YEAR. OF THAT IT WENT INTO THE

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.962
STORE THE STORE WAS SO DRY IT

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:30.529
NEVER MADE IT INTO OUR MAIN

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:33.332
RESERVOIRS. I THINK. HAVING

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:34.366
LIVED AND WORKED IN THE LAST

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.768
ROW. WHAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY

00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:38.236
DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW IN THIS

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:41.106
EXPERIENCE. IS THE ROOT HEAD ET

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:43.108
AT WHICH THESE EXTREME EVENTS

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:45.344
ARE COMPOUNDING. CREATING

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.846
CASCADING AFFECTS A DOMINO

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:50.749
EFFECT WERE ONE EVENTS DRYNESS

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:53.185
IS CONTRIBUTING TO ANOTHER HE

00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:53.986
WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING TO

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:56.221
ANOTHER DROUGHT. WHICH THE ROLL

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:58.357
UP OF ALL ARE PRODUCING THE

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:01.259
INABILITY TO SPACE FOR OUR

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:04.997
NATURAL SPECIES TO USE THEIR

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:06.865
RESILIENCY AND REBEL. SO HERE'S

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.400
WHAT I THINK WE'RE SEEING RIGHT

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:10.569
NOW IN OUR DEPARTMENT ACROSS

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:14.239
WATER SHIFTS SUMMARIZE DOWN OIL

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:17.242
DOWN LAND LANGUAGE. WE SEE LOW

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:20.245
WATER FLOWS IN OUR RIVER AND

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:23.982
ARE CREATES. THOSE LOW FLOWS IN

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:27.319
TURN TRIGGER WARMER WATER

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:28.987
TEMPERATURES. THOSE WARMER

00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:30.722
WATER TEMPERATURES INCREASED

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:34.259
DISTRESS THEY ALSO AMPLIFIED

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.662
THE RISK AND PREVALENCE OF

00:21:36.728 --> 00:21:39.998
PATHOGENS AND DISEASE SPREAD.

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:41.633
THEY CONTRIBUTE TO ELEVATED

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.934
LEVELS OF JUVENILE SALMON

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:45.604
MORTALITY. THEY ARE CAUSING

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:48.340
ADULT RESPOND MORTALITY RATES

00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:50.842
THAT ARE UNUSUAL. AND THIS IS

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:52.644
LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:55.814
INSTREAM AG LOS. SO WE LEARN

00:21:55.881 --> 00:21:57.983
FROM ALL ASTRO. CURRENTLY

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.618
OBSERVING IMPACTS BUT THE

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:04.589
REALITY IS A FULL IMPACTS OF

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:05.190
TWENTY TWENTY ONE REALLY WON'T

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:07.225
BE REALIZED FOR ANOTHER TWO OR

00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:09.094
THREE YEARS BECAUSE YOU KNOW

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.063
TESE FISH HAVE ABOUT A THREE

00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:14.399
YEAR LIFECYCLE. IT'S IMPORTANT

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:16.301
TO TOUCH ON FISHING FOR JUST A

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:18.403
MOMENT WHICH IS ANOTHER. PART

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.838
OF OUR DEPARTMENT'S CORE

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:22.040
CONSTITUENCY. GENERALLY

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:24.609
SPEAKING OCEAN SALMON FISHERIES

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:27.045
BOTH SPORT AND COMMERCIAL. OUR

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:28.613
CONTINUING IS APPROVED BY THE

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.382
FEDERAL MANAGEMENT COUNCIL THE

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:33.118
PS AND MISSY BUT AS YOU KNOW

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:35.020
THOSE SEASONS ARE SHORTENED

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.221
MORE IN SOME PLACES ARE

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:39.391
NONEXISTENT IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:40.926
ONE WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:42.494
THE ALREADY LOW ABUNDANCE

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:45.097
FORECAST FOR KLAMATH RIVER FALL

00:22:45.163 --> 00:22:48.467
RUN CHINOOK. SO AS AN EXAMPLE

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.535
BASICALLY NORTH OF FORT BRAGG

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:51.903
IN WHAT'S CALLED THE KLAMATH

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.506
MANAGEMENT'S ON THERE WILL BE

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:55.741
NO COMMERCIAL FISHING ALLOWED

00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:58.043
IN TWENTY THREE ONE. WHAT'S

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.178
UNIQUE AND I ASK EVERYONE TO

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:02.514
REMEMBER IS WITHIN THE MIDDLE

00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:05.050
OF THIS WEEK MASS. THERE ARE

00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:07.619
ALSO MOMENTS OF BRIGHTER. NEWS

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:11.757
OR BETTER OUTLOOKS EVEN THOUGH

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:14.392
THERE IS RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.828
OR RECREATIONAL FISHING. WHAT

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:18.096
WE'RE ALSO SEEING HAPPEN RIGHT

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:20.265
NOW IS FOR THOSE FISHERIES THAT

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:23.602
ARE OPEN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:26.238
TWENTY ONE CATCHES ARE AS GOOD

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:29.407
OR BETTER THAN THE PRE SEASON

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:32.544
PROJECTIONS SO FAR. AND IN FACT

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.246
WE HAVE AN UNUSUALLY HIGH

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:37.082
PROJECTION. FOR RETURNS OF

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:39.718
WINTER RUN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:42.020
AND THAT'S PLAYING AL AS WE'RE

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:44.289
MAKING IN THE FIELD

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:46.424
OBSERVATIONS LOOKING AT. I ALSO

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:49.127
THINK THERE ARE OTHER BRIGHTER

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:54.399
MOMENTS. TO UNDERSCORE HERE WE

00:23:54.466 --> 00:23:56.468
LEARNED A LOT FROM LAST ROW. DO

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:59.471
IN THE LEGISLATURE INVESTED IN

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:01.540
OUR DEPARTMENT WE SPENT

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:02.741
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COMING OUT

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:05.877
OF THE LAST ROW. TO IMPROVE OUR

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:07.712
HATCHERY INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.781
WITH PASSAGE AT THE JUNE RISKS

00:24:09.848 --> 00:24:11.516
WITHIN OUR OWN FACILITIES

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:13.785
REFURBISH AND MODERNIZE OUR

00:24:13.852 --> 00:24:18.123
TRUCKING FLEETS. WE WILL LEARN

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.026
WHAT WATERSHED IN THE STATE MAY

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:26.665
TURN WORST. THIS MONITORING IN

00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:29.000
COLLABORATION WITH ALMOST EVERY

YOUR PANELS TODAY. SO AS WE

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:36.675
WENT INTO THIS DROUGHT I THINK

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:37.175
WE HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:43.448

THEIR WATER USE SO WE CAN

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:02.761
INCREASE STREAMFLOW. ALL KINDS

00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:06.031
OF MINUTES ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY.

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:07.165
MY COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.167
WATER BOARD HAVE MOVED FASTER.

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.636
WE ARE IN A SPACE TODAY THAT WE

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:13.705
WERE NOT IN LAST DROUGHT AND IT

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:16.174
CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED. OUR STATE

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.209
WATER BOARD IS ACTIVELY

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:21.746
PURSUING EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.

00:26:21.813 --> 00:26:25.116
AND CURTAILMENTS OF WATER.

00:26:25.183 --> 00:26:26.284
THAT'S HIS STORE THAT'S

00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:28.586
CHALLENGING IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S

00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:31.323
COMPLICATED A CONTROVERSY. MY

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:33.358
DEPARTMENT IS AS WE SPEAK

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:34.592
WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:36.261
THE WATER BOARD TO ESTABLISH

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:37.429
MINIMUM INSTREAM FLOWS FOR

00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:38.964
SALMON AND MANY OTHER

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:39.764
WATERSHEDS THAT ARE BEING

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:41.900
DISCUSSED TODAY. WE SUBMITTED

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:43.268
FORMAL LETTERS TO THE WATER

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:44.736
BOARD REQUESTING A LONG TERM

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:47.339
SOLUTION FLOWS ON THE SCOTT AND

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:48.974
SHASTA RIVER IN THE KLAMATH

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.009
BASIN. THE WATER BOARD IS

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:53.044
LOOKING AT HER TALENTS FOR

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:54.879
WATER USERS AND THE UPPER

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:57.082
RUSSIAN RIVER SYSTEM.

00:26:57.148 --> 00:26:59.651
SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA.

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:01.720
THINGS THAT DID NOT OCCUR IN

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:05.824
ALASKA. LET ME TURN QUICKLY TO

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.492
A COUPLE OF THE SPECIFIC RIVERS

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:09.527
AND THEN GET OUT OF THE WAY.

00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:12.430
THE KLAMATH RIVER. IS ONE OF

00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:14.432
THE PLACES THAT I CARE ABOUT

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:16.434
THE MOST ON THE ENTIRE PLANET.

00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:17.836
NOW WE'VE HAD SOME DIFFICULT

00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:19.771
DYNAMICS IN THE MOST RECENT

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:21.840
WEEKS AND MONTHS. WE ARE

00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:23.041
EXPERIENCING A VERY HIGH

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:25.210
CONCENTRATION OF A TWO KILLER

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:26.044
FISH DISEASE THAT WE

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:28.346
COLLOQUIALLY SHORTHAND S. C.

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:31.483
SHASTA. IT RESULTS IN HIGHER

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:33.451
THAN AVERAGE RATES OF DISEASE.

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:36.254
AND IT TRANSLATES INTO

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.356
INCREASED JUVENILE FISH KILLS.

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:39.724
WE HAD A DIFFICULT SEVERAL

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:41.593
WEEKS WORKING WITH THE RIVER

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:43.628
VALLEY TRIED. AND THE CREW

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:45.397
TRIED TO YOUR ROCK TRIED

00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:47.599
COMMERCIAL FISHING AND OUR

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:49.000
FEDERAL AGENCY COUNTERPARTS BUT

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:50.668
MADE THE DIFFERENCE THE HARD

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:53.371
DECISION TO EVACUATE OUR HIGH

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:55.573
TREE ON THE KLAMATH RIVER FROM

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.842
THE FISH WE WERE RAISING. AND

00:27:57.909 --> 00:28:01.012
MOVE THEM OVER TO OUR FACILITY

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:02.814
ON THE TRINITY RIVER. HOLD THEM

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.016
THERE WHILE WE HOPE FOR BETTER

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:07.285
RIVER CONDITIONS IN THE KLAMATH

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.254
FALLS TAKE THEM BACK AND IT'S-

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.656
IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. YES WE

00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:13.191
HAVE LOW FLOWS BUT WE ALSO HAVE

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:15.960
RUN INTO. YET AGAIN THE

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.429
MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE AROUND THE

00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:18.997
REDUCED VOLUME OF WATER IN

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:21.433
CALIFORNIA'S RESERVOIRS LATE TO

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:23.768
COLD WATER POOLS. WE ARE

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:26.938
SEEING. IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:29.107
WINTER RUN RETURN OF SALMON

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:31.476
WHICH IS GREATER THAN PREDICTED

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:33.611
THAT'S GOOD NEWS BUT THERE IS

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:36.848
ALSO WAY HIGHER THAN HISTORICAL

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:38.750
RESPOND MORTALITY OF FEMALES

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:40.919
HONORS. AND LET ME CLARIFY

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:43.388
SOMETHING WHERE I DISAGREE WITH

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:45.356
YOUR STOCK MODELS NUMBER NEED

00:28:45.423 --> 00:28:46.257
TO CONCLUDE ABOUT THIRTY

00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:47.225
SECONDS WE'LL COME BACK FOR

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:48.393
QUESTIONS PLEASE DESTRUCTOR

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.561
PRISONERS DID YOUR STAFF

00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:51.296
ANALYSIS THAT IS SHOCKINGLY

00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:52.630
THIS YEAR THE CALIFORNIA

00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:53.231
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:55.366
WILDLIFE. HAS DETERMINED THAT A

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:57.035
100% OF ENDANGERED WINTER RUN

00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:58.436
CHINOOK SALMON JUVENILES ARE

00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:01.139
LIKELY. TO PERISH IN THE RIVER

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.908
YOU TO EXCESSIVE TO THAT'S NOT

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:06.177
ACT. FIRST ALL WHAT WE HAVE

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.680
SAID AT THE STAFF LEVEL WHICH I

00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:10.582
BELIEVE IS THE SOURCE OF

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:13.918
THE REPORTING. IS WE ARE MORE

00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:19.190
LIKELY. TO HAVE. AN EARLIER

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:21.426
LOSS OF ABILITY TO PROVIDE COOL

00:29:21.493 --> 00:29:24.562
WATER. AND THAT SUBSEQUENTLY IT

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:27.699
IS POSSIBLE. THAT NEARLY ALL OF

00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:30.301
THE AND RIVER JUVENILES WILL

00:29:30.368 --> 00:29:32.537
NOT SURVIVE THIS. WE HAVE SAID

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.739
THE COLD WATER WILL PROBLEM IS

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:37.342
LIKELY TO BECOME WORSE. WHICH

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:39.744
CREATES THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT

00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:41.513
MORTALITY OF THAT WE HAVE NOT

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:43.481
COME OUT AND SAID. THAT THERE

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:46.618
IS A 1100% GUARANTEED CHANCE

00:29:46.684 --> 00:29:48.720
ALL OF THESE FISH WILL BE LOST.

00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:51.656
IT'S A GRIM SITUATION BUT I

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:52.190
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:55.593
ACCURATE- THIS SAME DYNAMIC IS

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.595
OCCURRING ACROSS COASTAL RIVERS

00:29:57.662 --> 00:29:59.030
RUSSIAN RIVER IS A GREAT

00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:01.733
EXAMPLE WHERE THE RIVER LEVELS.

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:04.736
ARE AS LOW AS THEY HAVE EVER

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:07.105
BEEN INCLUDING BACK IN THE

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:10.208
NINETEEN SEVENTIES. SO WHEN YOU

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.477
LOOK ACROSS THE STATE. ONE CAN

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.245
LEAVE THIS CONVERSATION

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:16.447

NIGHT THINKING ABOUT TODAY IT

00:30:21.786 --> 00:30:24.222
KEEPS ME UP MOST NIGHTS. BUT I

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:27.091
ALSO THINK WITHIN THIS PICTURE

00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:30.094
IS THE ABILITY FOR US. TO SAVE

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:32.664
THE SITUATION TO ENSURE THESE

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.265

STEPS- AND ALSO WORKING IN

00:33:52.797 --> 00:33:53.998
LOOKING FOR CREATIVE I'M

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:56.768
VOLUNTARY SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF

00:33:56.834 --> 00:33:58.503
THE CHALLENGES THAT WORK MORE

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:02.173
FACED WITH- INSTRUCTABLE. I'M

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.041
NOTED IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA

00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:07.912
IT'S THE ENTIRE WEST- THAT IS-

00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:09.781
IS BEING RAPIDLY DEVELOPING

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:12.150
EXTREME HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:13.251
IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER

00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:14.719
WATERSHED WE'RE NOW IN THE

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:16.854
THIRD DRIEST YEAR IN THE LAST

00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:19.157
HUNDRED YEARS. THE TWENTY

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:19.857
TWENTY ONE WATER YEAR WAS THE

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:21.492
SECOND DRIEST TWO YEAR PERIOD

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:23.161
ON ON RECORD AND WE'RE

00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:24.162
EXPERIENCING THE DRIEST

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.898
CONDITIONS SINCE NINETEEN

00:34:26.964 --> 00:34:29.967
SEVENTY SEVEN- IN ADDITION- HAS

00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:31.102
ALSO NOTED BY DIRECTOR BOND

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:33.104
AND- THIS SPRING THE SACRAMENTO

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:34.138
SOUTHERN AMERICAN RIVER

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:35.807
WATERSHEDS. WHICH FEED THE

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:37.642
MAJOR- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:39.610
RESERVOIRS AN EXPERIENCED AN

00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:41.379
ACCELERATED RATE OF SNOW MELT

00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:46.250
AND ON AN UNPRECEDENTED- OUR

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:48.252
MOTION BY SOILS AND RATHER THAN

FILLING. RESERVOIRS AND AS

00:34:50.488 --> 00:34:52.757
PREDICTED SO THESE AND OTHER

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:55.660
FACTORS REDUCED WATER SUPPLIES

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.361
FOR TWO MAJOR- STATE AND

00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:59.464
FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS BY NEAR

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.865
NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.200
ACRE FEET WHICH IS ENOUGH WATER

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.734
TO SUPPLY MORE THAN ONE MILLION

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:05.870
HOUSEHOLDS FOR A YEAR. SO THIS

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:11.409
WAS A- DRAMATIC. PASSED CHANGES

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:14.912
IN ANTICIPATED- CONDITIONS- AND

00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:17.482
AS YOU'VE NOTICED- ARE AT S. AS

00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:20.351
OTHERS HAD NOTICED NOTED- IN

00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:22.987
THE KLAMATH BASIN- INCLUDING

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:25.523
THE SCOTT SHASTA RIVER-

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.192
TRIBUTARIES AND WATERSHEDS.

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:30.628
WHERE THE RIVERS AND SURFACE

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:31.996
WATERS ARE CRITICAL SOURCES OF

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:37.235
WATER FOR. ECONOMIC ECOLOGICAL

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:39.036
AND CULTURAL PURPOSES OF

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:40.738
PRECIPITATION LEVELS ARE HALF

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:42.406
OF NORMAL ACROSS MUCH OF THAT

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:45.643
BASIN THE SCOTT IS EXPERIENCING

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.944
ONE OF THE FOUR DRIEST YEARS ON

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:49.013
RECORD WITH FLOWS IN THE LOWEST

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.048
5% OF THE HISTORICAL RECORD IN

00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:53.050
THE SHASTA THE CURRENT WATER

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:53.985
YEAR IS THE DRIEST ON RECORD

00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:55.553
FOR THE RIVER. WHICH IS WITH

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.989
FLOWS IN THE LOWEST 1% OF

00:35:58.055 --> 00:35:59.423
HISTORICAL RECORDS. THE RUSSIAN

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.159
RIVER ANOTHER CRITICAL

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:03.561
WATERSHED THAT IT HAS

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:04.462
EXPERIENCED THE LOWS

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:05.730
PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS AND

00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:08.599
ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS- LEADING

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:10.101
TO THE LOWEST- STORAGE LEVEL

00:36:10.167 --> 00:36:11.736
EVER EXPERIENCED FOR THIS TIME

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:13.671
OF YEAR LAKE MENDOCINO AND LIKE

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:15.640
CINEMA- WHICH PROVIDES CRITICAL

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:17.942
SUPPLIES OF DRINKING WATER FOR

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.911
OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:21.579
THOUSAND PEOPLE AND FLOWS FOR

00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:23.180
THREATENED AND ENDANGERED FISH.

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:24.782
LAKE MENDOCINO WAS AT RISK FOR

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.217
DRAINING COMPLETELY BY THE END

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:28.085
OF THE YEAR- IS THE CURRENT DRY

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:30.187
CONDITIONS- PERSIST WITHOUT

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:34.125
ACTION TAKEN BY. THE WATER. SO

00:36:34.191 --> 00:36:36.127
I THINK THAT SUMMER SHOWS THAT

00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:37.962
WE'RE FACING SUBSTANTIAL WATER

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:38.863
SUPPLY AND ECOSYSTEM

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.499
CHALLENGES. AND WE KNOW THAT

00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:43.301
THAT THAT SUCH CONDITIONS CAN

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:44.335
RESULT IN DEGRADED WATER

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:46.938

LOW FLOWS AND SLOWER FLOWS

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:30.594
DEFINITELY MEAN WARMER WATER

00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:32.696
WHICH ARE DANGEROUS TO THE

00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:34.231

REFERRED TO AND THE STAFF

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:10.267
ANALYSIS. WAS THE ASSERTION

00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:11.835
THAT OUR DEPARTMENT HAS

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:15.839
DETERMINED THAT A 100% OF THESE

00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:18.342
PARTICULAR SALMON JUVENILES ARE

00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:20.744
LIKELY TO PERISH. YEAH I DID

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:23.080
AND I'M I'M NOT QUIBBLING THE

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:24.314

THE MOST LIKELY. SCENARIO AND

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:33.323
I'M I'M I'M ANSWERING I REALIZE

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.326
I'M A SLOW TALKER. AND I THINK

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:40.831
THAT REFERENCE BY STAFF IS TO

00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:45.769
OUR TECHNICAL STAFF- HAVING

SHARED AMONGST ALL THE MANAGERS.

00:46:54.878 --> 00:47:03.887
THAT WHAT IS SLIGHTLY. IS R.

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:06.823
ONE. AN EARLIER LOSS OF THE

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:09.393
ABILITY TO PROVIDE COOL WATER

00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:12.663
SO WE THINK THAT'S LIKELY. AND

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.731
THAT EARLIER LOSS OF YOU KNOW

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:17.100
MANAGING COOL WATER MAKES IT

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:22.139
POSSIBLE. WE MAY FACE- WELL YOU

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:27.177
KNOW I'M- NEARLY ALL OF LOS SO

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:29.213
IT'S NOT AN EVENTUALITY IT'S A

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:33.517
POSSIBILITY. FOR SEVERAL MONTHS

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:35.118
IN PUBLIC FORUM WE'VE ALSO BEEN

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:38.488
NOTING. THAT THE STATISTICAL

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:41.458
MODELING WE ARE RUNNING WITH

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.860
OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS IT-

NATIONAL REVIEW FISHERIES

SERVICE SOUTHWEST SCIENCE

CENTER. IS PREDICTING. THE

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:54.871
POTENTIAL FOR AN 80% PLUS

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:56.807
WHAT'S CALLED TEMPERATURE

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.842
DEPENDENT MORTALITY LOSS SO

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:01.812
VICE CHAIR I'M NOT TELLING YOU

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:04.715
WE'RE SAYING IT'S A 100% LOS

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:06.550
IT'S GUARANTEED IT'S A 100%

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:10.320
LOSS I THINK WE'RE IN THE SPACE

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:12.456
OF A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:15.993
SUBSTANTIAL LOSS TO RISK. AND

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:17.561
IT RELATES TO THIS DYNAMIC

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:20.264
AROUND LOW FLOW TEMPERATURE IN

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:25.869
COLD WATER. ALSO SAY THAT WE

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:29.306
HEARD FRAMING EARLIER AND I'VE

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:31.575
SEEN IT REPORTED ELSEWHERE.

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:34.344
THAT THIS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:38.115
MANAGEMENT POLICIES ADOPTED BY

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:40.217
THE LAST FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION.

PRIOR FEDERAL MINISTRATION

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:49.960

00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:01.271
AGENCY OUR LEAD AGAINST.

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:02.172
CATALYTIC ISSUE WAS BROUGHT IN

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:05.142
PART BECAUSE OF OUR JUDGMENT OF

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:07.511
THE SALMON PROTECTIONS IN THE

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:07.978
FEDERAL APPROACH WERE

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:11.348
INSUFFICIENT. ALSO REMIND FOLKS

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:14.151
THAT I THINK YES. LAST WEEK

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:16.253
MAYBE TEN DAYS AGO THE FEDERAL

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.422

FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IN TWO

00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:58.562
THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WE

00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:03.033
HAD- THE LAST DROUGHT- AND

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.669
NINETY FIVE PERCENT. OF WINTER

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:09.206

SACRAMENTO. IN IN YOUR OWN

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:13.877
DEPARTMENT AND AGAIN I THINK

WELL. MAYBE I WAS STATE MORE-

00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:19.816
BOLDLY AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I

KNOW YOU'RE STILL LOOKING AT

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:22.953
WANTING TO BE A TO CONFIRM THE

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:24.121
NUMBERS TO YOUR OWN DEPARTMENT

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:25.956
TOLD SEEN IN LAST WEEK THAT

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:28.725
THERE AND QUOTE AND- THERE

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:30.727
COULD BE A NEAR CUP COMPLETE

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:32.829
CALL COMPLETE LOSS OF THE YOUNG

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:34.197
ENDANGERED SPECIES OF SALMON

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:35.432
BECAUSE TEMPERATURES ABOVE A

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.167
HUNDRED DEGREES. FOR EXTENDED

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:39.669
PERIODS OF TIME. ARE

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:41.471
OVERHEATING THE RIVER MAKING IT

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.006
UNINHABITABLE FOR THE FISH TO

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:44.841
GROW BEYOND THE EGG STAGE THE

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:45.809
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:49.279
AND WILDLIFE CONFIRMED TO CNN.

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:51.948
SO LOOK WE CAN. ADD TO IT HAVE

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:54.017
THE NASCENT MACHINATIONS HERE

00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:55.018
TODAY BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:57.187
THIS. IN A DROUGHT THAT WAS NOT

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:58.722
AS SEVERE AS WHAT WE'RE SEEING

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:01.925
NOW WE HAD A 95% DIE OFF. AND I

00:51:01.992 --> 00:51:04.060
GET THAT. MAYBE WE DON'T WANT

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:06.129
TO CONFIRM THAT NOW. BUT THE

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:07.197
FEDS ARE THE SAME THERE'S GOING

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:09.332
TO BE AN 80% WE KNOW THAT IT'S

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:10.834
GOING TO BE WORSE YOUR OWN

00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:12.002
DEPARTMENT IS SAYING IT IS

00:51:12.068 --> 00:51:12.903
GOING TO BE A NEAR COMPLETE

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:17.541
LOSS- AND- IT IS. IN PART AS

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:19.409
YOU SAID CLIMATE CHANGE BUT

00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:21.411
IT'S ALSO IN PART THAT WE STILL

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:24.281
HAVE THE HOLDOVER. WATER POLICY

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:25.048
FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:27.050
WHERE WE HAVE LITERALLY PUT THE

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:29.386
PEDAL TO THE METAL. RELEASE OUR

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:31.655
COLD WATER STORAGE. RIGHT DOWN

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:33.757
TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND NOW

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:36.960
WE ARE IN A WORSE WATER.

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:39.496
CONDITION YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:40.063
ONE AND WE WERE IN FOURTEEN

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.065
FIFTEEN. IN THE SUPPLY SIMPLY

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:44.134
IS NOT THERE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:46.837
THOSE JUVENILE SALMON. FOR FROM

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:49.239
DYING OFF AND THAT'S JUST NOT I

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:51.775
SEEN THAT THAT'S- ORGANIZATIONS

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:53.543
THAT ARE FOCUSING ON FISHERIES

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:56.246
AND AQUACULTURE AND THAT'S A

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:57.447
100% OF WHAT THEY DO. AT THE

00:51:57.514 --> 00:51:59.449
COLD WATER POOL IN LAKE SHASTA

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:01.117
SIMPLY ISN'T GOING TO BE THERE

00:52:01.184 --> 00:52:02.686
THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THAT

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.721
FEDERAL POLICY. I THAT AGAIN

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:07.190
HAS THE FEDS. THIS CURRENT

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.892
ADMINISTRATION IT'S CARRIED

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:09.826
OVER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:11.695
POLICY AND PUT THE PEDAL TO

00:52:11.761 --> 00:52:13.763
METAL TO GET THAT. WATER DOWN

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.232
TO THE CENTER VALLEY RATHER

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:16.633
THAN FINDING THAT BALANCE

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.535
BETWEEN FISHERIES AND THE

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:19.402
ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS FARMERS

00:52:19.469 --> 00:52:22.339
AND RANCHERS. SO MISTER MISTER

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:23.273
DIRECTOR LET YOU COMMENT ON

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.742
THAT BUT I THINK WE MAY BE

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:27.978
SAYING THE SAME THING IN AB I.

00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:30.046
HAVE MY SKI A LITTLE FOR YOURS

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:33.016
AT THIS POINT BUT- UNDERSTAND.

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:35.385
THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT THIS

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:36.653
YEAR ISN'T GOING TO BE WORSE

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.688
THAN IT WAS IN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:42.592
WE SIGNED 95% DIE OFF. IT LOOKS

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:43.159
CENTER I AGREE WITH YOU ON.

00:52:43.226 --> 00:52:45.395
MANY RESPECTS. AND I DON'T MEAN

00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:49.432
TO ARGUE. THESE SEEMINGLY

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:53.303
BIZARRE NUANCES. I PERSONALLY

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.171
IN OUR DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN

00:52:55.238 --> 00:52:57.274
HITTING THE BALL HERE. WE THINK

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.943
THIS IS A SUPER SERIOUS AND

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.444
BLEAK SITUATION FOR SALMON

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:04.247
ACROSS THE STATE. IN PARTICULAR

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:05.749
IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER

00:53:05.815 --> 00:53:07.284
RELATIVE TO WIN OR RUN. ALSO

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:10.554
FALL RUN. WE'VE BEEN OPEN ABOUT

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.156
THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. IN

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:15.292
MANY PUBLIC VENUES AND WE'RE

00:53:15.358 --> 00:53:18.461
LOOKING AT PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:22.098
RISK OF LOSS IN THIS DYNAMIC OF

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:24.601
THOSE FINISHES LIFECYCLE-

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:29.506
WHETHER IT'S 80% 90% R. PERCENT.

00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:31.741
ANY OF THOSE PERCENTS ARE

00:53:31.808 --> 00:53:33.577
SIGNIFICANT FOR THESE FISH IN

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:36.246
PART. BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:37.614
THAT FULL OPPORTUNITY TO

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:40.350
REBOUND AS I WAS DISCUSSING IN

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:41.851
MY OPENING REMARKS SO I'M

00:53:41.918 --> 00:53:44.321
WORRIED. I THINK WE HAVE A

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.655
SIMILAR SITUATION ON THE

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:48.024
AMERICAN RIVER I THINK WE HAVE

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:48.558
A SIMILAR SITUATION ON THE

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:52.562
KLAMATH. I'M ALSO MORE WORRIED

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.631
TO BE HONEST. AS WE HEAD INTO

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:58.168
NEXT YEAR. OUR STANDARD METHODS

00:53:58.234 --> 00:54:00.203
OF EVALUATION AREN'T KEEPING UP

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:03.506
WITH. THESE CASCADING CLIMATE

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:07.611
EFFECTS SO I AM VERY FOCUSED ON.

00:54:07.677 --> 00:54:09.312
NOT ONLY WHAT I CAN DO TO

00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:11.247
MEDICAID AS AN EXAMPLE WE

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:14.050
SUCCESSFULLY MOVE SEVENTEEN

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:16.052
MILLION SALMON FISH. AT OUR

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.687
CENTRAL VALLEY HATCHERIES DOWN

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.489
THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY SAN PABLO

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:22.258
DAY COASTAL MET PENS WITH A

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:24.561
PRETTY HIGH SUCCESS RATE SO FAR.

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:26.830
THAT'S A MITIGATING ACTION I'M

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:28.198
FOCUSED ON THAT FOR THE COMING

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:30.567
DAYS AND WEEKS WE JUST HAVE

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:33.003
RESCUED I THINK ALMOST THREE

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:33.603
THOUSAND COHO IN THE RUSSIAN

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.105
RIVER WATERSHED ANOTHER

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:37.641
MITIGATING EXAMPLE. BUT I'M

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:39.042
ALSO VERY MUCH STARTING TO

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.977
THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.545
WE GET TO OCTOBER ONE OF THIS

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:44.914
COMING YEAR. AND WHAT IS IT'S

00:54:44.981 --> 00:54:46.850
AS DRY OR DRIER THAN THIS

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:50.053
CURRENT YEAR. AND THESE ARE

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.188
GONNA BE SUPER EVEN MORE

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:53.757
DIFFICULT DECISIONS UNDER THOSE

00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:57.060
SCENARIOS. THAT'S WHY MY

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:58.361
DEPARTMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.196
OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE STATE

00:55:00.263 --> 00:55:01.631
PERMIT FOR THE STATE WATER

00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:03.833
PROJECT HAS MUCH MORE SPECIFIC

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.402
SALMON TRIGGERS THAT ARE MORE

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.704
PROTECTIVE. OR THE SALMON RUNS

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.606
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:11.441
TRUMP OPINION APPROACH TO

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:13.343
SALMON UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.311
NINETEEN OPINION. AND I AND I

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:17.313
GOTTA SAY INDIA WITH FULL

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:20.150
DISCLOSURE. DIRECTOR BONHAM WE

00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:25.722
OWE HIM CREDIT FOR MOVING ON.

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:27.457
MOVING IT TO GET THE FISH

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:28.391
EITHER KEEPING FISHING

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:29.759
HATCHERIES OR MOVING FISH

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:33.263
AROUND TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:34.330
LONGEVITY OF THE SPECIES I'M

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:36.399
NOT. DISPUTING THAT AND THAT'S

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:37.267
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:38.101
ABLE TO SAY THANK YOU TO

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:39.135
DIRECTOR BONHAM AND CALIFORNIA

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:40.637
PARDON FISH AND WILDLIFE I

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:43.640
GUESS MY PIECES THIS FOR US NOT

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:45.442
TO COME TO CONCLUSION THAT THIS

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:48.278
YEAR IS GOING TO BE WORSE THAN

00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:49.079
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WHERE WE SAW

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:51.614
95% DIE OFF. IN BECAUSE WE MAY

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:52.716
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT SAYING

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:54.751
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:58.555
ME WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS EVEN IF

00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:00.590
THOSE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN-

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:02.559
SALMON MAKE IT BACK UP THE

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:03.727
SPONDYLUS EGGS ARE GONNA BE

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:05.562
COOKED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:07.097
THAT COLD WATER POOL. AND

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:09.466
THAT'S WHY I AM DEEPLY

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:11.835
CONCERNED BOTH ON THE TRUMP

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:13.236
ADMINISTRATION WATER POLICY

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:15.839
THAT IS A HOLDOVER NUMBER ONE

00:56:15.905 --> 00:56:18.241
NUMBER TWO WE HAVE A WORST

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:19.876
DROUGHT IN THE NUMBER THREE

00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:21.211
MMHM WE HAVE THE CLIMATE

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:24.981
IMPACTS OF THE DIRECTOR SPOKE

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:26.282
INCREDIBLY ELOQUENT. ON SO

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:27.817
AGAIN I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:29.052

ACTION TO TRUCK ALL STATE

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:34.023
HATCHERY S. SALMON. THIS YEAR

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.792
BECAUSE RELEASING THEM INTO THE

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.360
RIVERS WOULD HAVE MOST LIKELY

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:40.230
MEANT 1100% MORTALITY IN ME

00:56:40.296 --> 00:56:41.931
SENATOR YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD.

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:45.401
ONE GLIMMER OF HOPE SO INNOCENT

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:45.902
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:48.238
SACRAMENTO. THERE'S ALSO

00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:50.106
ANOTHER DYNAMIC. OF ALL OF

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:52.375
THEM. SO OUR DEPARTMENT IN THE

00:56:52.442 --> 00:56:55.578
STATE YOUR LEADERSHIP WE HAVE

00:56:55.645 --> 00:56:58.448
FUNDED A LOT OF. REMOVAL OF

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:01.684
BARRIERS. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:03.486
FISH PASSAGE AND WHAT'S CALLED

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:06.589
BATTLE CREEK. IS A TRIBUTARY TO

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:10.226
THE UPPER SACRAMENTO. AND WE

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:12.128
HAVE RELEASED JUVENILE WINNER

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:14.264
RUN INTO BATTLE CREEK AFTER ALL

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.666
OF THAT WORK. AND WHAT WE'RE

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:18.001
SEEING IN BATTLE CREEK LAST

00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:21.104
YEAR. THIS YEAR'S WE'RE GETTING

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:24.240
RETURNING CHINOOK ADULTS OVER

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:26.476
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. AND

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:28.311
WE'RE ALMOST DONE WITH FULL

00:57:28.378 --> 00:57:30.480
BARRIER REMOVAL AND THEN

00:57:30.547 --> 00:57:32.081
PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:34.517
COMPANY SURRENDERS THEIR HYDRO

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:37.487
LICENSE AND BATTLE CREEK IS ON

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:41.958
THE BRINK OF BECOMING A LISTS

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.127
FREE FLOWING STREAM. IN THE

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:46.029
CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE UPPER

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:47.664
SACRAMENTO WHY IS THAT

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:50.800
IMPORTANT. IT IS A CORE

00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:53.736
POTENTIAL REFUGIA FOR WINTER

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:56.039
RUN AND SPRING RUN TO MAKE A

00:57:56.105 --> 00:57:58.408
HOME IN A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:02.245
ACCESS TO COOL COLD WATER. AND

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:03.713
GET OUT OF THAT STRETCH OF THE

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.081
UPPER SACRAMENTO AND ALL ME

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.116
LITERALLY GET OUT WE NEED TO

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.219
MANAGE THAT AS WELL. BUT HAVE

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:12.255
AN ADDITIONAL HABITAT RESOURCE

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:14.390
FOR THE SPANISH WE ARE NOT

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:15.692
GOING TO GET THE RECOVERY WILL

00:58:15.758 --> 00:58:18.528
REBOUND UNLESS WE'RE DEALING

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:19.629
WITH THESE DIFFICULT WATER

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:21.764
MANAGEMENT ISSUES. THIS UPPER

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:24.901
SACRAMENTO DYNAMIC BUT ALSO

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:26.970
DOING THINGS LIKE BATTLE CREEK

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:28.771
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:29.305
ALSO TRYING TO DO IN THE

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:33.176
KLAMATH. GIVING FISH ACCESS TO

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:35.311
COOL COLD HABITAT OUT OF THE

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:37.947
HOT CENTRAL VALLEY RIVERS IS

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:40.950
ITSELF THE SALMON RESILIENCY

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:43.186
CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY. SO

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:46.289
IT'S GRAHAM I AGREE WITH YOU

00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:48.358
I'M NOT READY TO CALL IT AS BAD

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:50.660
AS LAST DROUGHT IT MAY BE AND

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:52.795
I'M WILLING TO SAY THAT. I'D

00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:53.796
LIKE TO SEE THE DATA WHEN WE'RE

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:56.232
DONE WE COULD BE IN THAT SAME

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:58.935
OR WORSE STATISTICAL SITUATION.

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:02.672
BUT THEIR WITNESS MOMENTS OF

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:03.673
HOPE LIKE BATTLE CREEK. THANK

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I WANT TO

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:09.746
TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL BUREAU

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:11.714
OF RECLAMATION'S WATER POLICY

00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:13.516
FOR A MOMENT. FISHERY

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.919
BIOLOGISTS AND SCIENTISTS SAY

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:19.222
THAT THAT HOLD OVER FEDERAL

00:59:19.289 --> 00:59:22.425
WATER POLICY IS BAD FOR FISH IN

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:23.826
OUR ENVIRONMENT HERE IN

00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:26.529
CALIFORNIA. THAT CAN YOU TALK

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:29.065
ABOUT IN THE CONCERN IS THAT

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:30.133
THE FISH KILLS CAN BE WORSE

00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:32.268
WHETHER IT'S JUVENILE FORM OR

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:34.037
COOKING THE EGGS THAT ARE IN

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:35.204
THAT OVER HEATED WATER

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.839
ESPECIALLY IN THE SACRAMENTO.

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:39.442
RIVER CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:41.511
THOUGHTS THE BOARD STOCK ON.

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:44.580
THE PLAN TO BE ABLE TO WHETHER

00:59:44.647 --> 00:59:46.649
IT'S TO CHALLENGE THIS FEDERAL

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:49.118
POLICY IN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:53.957
IT'S MAKING IT WORSE. FOR THOSE

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:59.262
ALREADY IMPAIRED WATERSHEDS. HI

LAST ADMINISTRATION- CERTAINLY-

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:19.315
CHANGED THE COACH UNDER THE

ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT- IN THE

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:24.087
WAY THE FEDERAL PROJECTS WERE

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.923
WERE MANAGED ON ON ON THE OTHER

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.925
HAND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO HAVE

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:32.295
A DIALOGUE WITH THE BUREAU-

THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND- NEW

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:31.921
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION OF BOTH

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:32.955
ON THE WILDLIFE AGENCIES AND

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:35.892
THE BUREAU- TO COME UP WITH

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:38.294
WITH WHAT IT- WHAT WOULD BE A-

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.896
NON. INAPPROPRIATE CARRYOVER

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:42.765

PROVIDE. THEM SOURCE OF COLD

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:46.869
WATER THAT WOULD BENEFIT FISH

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:49.505
AND ALSO CARRY OVER STORAGE FOR

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:53.476
NEXT YEAR- AND- IN CASE IT WORK

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.712
WAS ALSO A DRYER CRITICALLY

01:01:56.779 --> 01:02:00.616
DRY- HERE AND- WE ARE HAVE AND

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:02.385
WE'VE BEEN SOMEWHAT

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:04.587
DISAPPOINTED- THAT AGAIN THE

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:08.057
PREDICTIONS ABOUT- OPERATIONS

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:09.525
AND DRY CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:10.493
EVEN WORSE THAN OUR

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.062
CONSERVATIVE PREDICTIONS BUT-

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.664
WE DID WORK IN CLOSE

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:16.032
COLLABORATION WITH ALL OF THE

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:17.700
STATE AGENCIES AND THE FEDERAL

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.402
AGENCIES- UNDER THE NEW

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:22.071
ADMINISTRATION SO AGAIN WE OF

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.539
COURSE ARE WORKING WITH THAT

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:25.541
THE LEGACY FROM THE PREVIOUS

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:26.275
ADMINISTRATION IT TAKES A LOT

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:29.545
TO TRANSITION. BUT I THINK THAT

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.414
WE- HOW TO POSITIVE SEVEN

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:35.751
INTERACTIONS AND WHEN HE- YOU

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.687
KNOW LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED-

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:39.222
CONTINUE CONTINUING TO WORK

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:41.524
WITH THE BUREAU- WHEN

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.526
CONSULTATIONS ARE. INITIATED

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:48.397
THE SMALL. MAKING AN EXECUTOR

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:50.266
LOOK AT MANAGING DIRECTOR NOW

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:51.267
I'M NOT GONNA PUT WORDS INTO

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.702
HER MOUTH WHATSOEVER AND I'M

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:55.438
JUST GONNA SAY. MY OWN OPINION

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:57.273
AND I THINK THE OPINION OF.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.808
BIOLOGISTS AND SCIENTISTS

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:01.444
AROUND- WHO ARE FOCUSED ON THE

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:04.647
SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES THE

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:05.781
CURRENT BIOLOGICAL OPINION.

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:07.216
THAT IS GOOD FOR AGRICULTURE

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:08.985
BAD FOR FISHING BAD FOR THE

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:10.052
ENVIRONMENT JUST BEING CANDID

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:12.655
ABOUT IT. AND IF WE WERE

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:15.725
SERIOUS. ABOUT BRINGING BALANCE

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.493
BACK TO THOSE MOST IMPAIRED

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.329
WATERSHEDS WE LOOK BACK TO THAT

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:20.897
TWO THOUSAND NINE BIOLOGICAL

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.598
PENNY THAT WAS IN PLACE- THAT

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:27.203
WAS SET ASIDE RAMROD- IN WITH A

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.838
NEW POLICY THAT WAS FROM THE

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:30.573
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION RAM

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.708
ROUTED THROUGH. THAT MADE IT

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:34.043
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:37.380
SPECIES TO BETTER SURVIVE A

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:39.448
PRETTY BAD YEAR. LET ALONE IN

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:41.450
DIRE YEAR IN WHICH WERE SEEN SO

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:44.720
I UNDERSTAND THAT- THE BOARD IS

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.956
IN A VERY. CHALLENGING POSITION

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:48.558
IN NEEDING TO BE ABLE TO WORK

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:49.692
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:51.060
I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THE

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:52.461
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR BEING

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:54.030
HERE TODAY AND AGAIN I CAN'T

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:55.765
SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS. ABOUT

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.133
YOUR ASK ABOUT WHO'S MADE

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.901
HIMSELF AVAILABLE MORNING NOON

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:01.103
AND NIGHT FOR COMMUNITIES FOR

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:01.837
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS FOR

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:03.506
AGRICULTURAL GROUPS ACTIVE HERE

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:04.407
TO MEET WITH TO TRY TO FIND A

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:06.809
BALANCE BUT- AS LONG AS WE HAVE

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:09.145
THIS. DARK CLOUD HANGING OVER

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:11.247
US THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR THE

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:13.249
SURVIVAL OF THE SALMON SPECIES

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:15.284
ESPECIALLY IN THE SACRAMENTO IT

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.787
IS MAKING MATTERS. WORSE IN THE

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:20.523
STATE I AND IT IS COMPOUNDING

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.091
THE DIRE SITUATION WE HAVE

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:23.793
BECAUSE OF THIS HISTORIC

01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:25.595
DROUGHT SO ON THAT I JUST HAVE

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.296
A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS AND GO

IT IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.542
MISTER DIRECTOR TALK ABOUT YOUR

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.410
SITES THAT SAY WE FACE A

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.946
SIMILAR. DROUGHT CONDITION NEXT

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:46.649
YEAR. WHAT WILL THE DEPARTMENT

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.684
NEED TO DO TO MOBILIZE AND GIVE

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.286
US YOUR THOUGHTS IF WE SEE

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:52.054
SIMILAR CONDITIONS NEXT YEAR I

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:55.725
TO SAVE THE SPECIES. I

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:58.461
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. I ALSO

01:04:58.527 --> 01:04:59.562
JUST WANNA SAY BOTH TO YOU AND

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.430
THE VICE CHAIR I CHERISH AND

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:02.265
REALLY RESPECT THE

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:03.933
RELATIONSHIPS WE BUILD TOGETHER

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.469
OVER TIME. SO EVEN THOUGH FOR

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:07.737
THE PUBLIC WATCHING IT MAY FEEL

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:09.939
LIKE WE'RE ARGUING I APPRECIATE

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.707
THE HELP THE EXCHANGE OF.

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.542
INPUTS I VALUE THE ROLE OF THIS

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:16.345
COMMITTEE. SINCE THE NINETEEN

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:17.747
SEVENTIES IT'S BEEN ONE OF OUR

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:19.215
KEY JOINT COMMITTEES FOR OUR

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.751
DEPARTMENT SO THANK YOU. I AM

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:24.787
THINKING ABOUT THREE AREAS IF I

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:27.556
LOOK INTO TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:31.494
I ASSUME. YEAH IT'S ASTROTURF

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.296
FIRST I AM THINKING ABOUT OUR

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:35.031
DEPARTMENTS ON CAPACITY AND

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.099
INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK WE'RE

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:39.201
DOING BETTER IN THAT REGARD WE

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.803
HAVE A GREATER INFUSION OF

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.906
MONEY FOR THIS EMERGENCY IN

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:46.375
PART BECAUSE YOUR LEADERSHIP.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.844
WE HAD SO WE HAVEN'T SOONER.

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:51.180
AND IT'S IN ONE KIND OF

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:52.648
DISTRIBUTION SO WE'RE BETTER

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:55.484
PREPARED. BUT IN THIS SPACE

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:57.620
WHAT HAS ME WORRIED IS OUR

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.855
HATCHERY INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:03.326
REALLY NOT SET UP FOR. THIS

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:06.095
DYNAMIC ALLIES HATCHERIES WE ON

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:08.230
AN OPERATOR BELOW THE DAMS THEY

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:09.999
GET THE COOL WATER FROM THE

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.568
DAMS RESERVOIR THEY WERE SET UP

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:15.538
TO MITIGATE THE LOSS OF HABITAT

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:17.940
WHEN THE DAMS WERE CONSTRUCTED

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:19.642
BACK IN THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES.

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.377
SO RIGHT NOW WHAT'S GOING ON

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:23.479
WITH OUR FACILITIES IS WE CAN'T

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:26.949
KEEP COOL WATER COMING INTO.

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:29.752
THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.854
DYNAMIC IS ARGUABLY WARM

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:33.255
SPRINGS HATCHERY ON THE RUSSIAN

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.157
RIVER RIGHT NOW WHICH MR MACK

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:37.460
AND HELP MY TALK ABOUT. WORKING

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:39.628
WITH THE US ARMY CORPS'S INS

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.030
THEIR FACILITY WE CAN RUN IT

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.798
CAN'T KEEP ENOUGH COOL WATER

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:44.834
COMING INTO IT BECAUSE THE

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.435
RESERVOIRS MENDOCINO CINEMA.

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.572
DON'T HAVE. TO WORK WITH FORCED

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:50.973
WHEN AND WHERE DO WE MOVE THE

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.576
FISH TOO. AND AS WE'RE MOVING

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:56.245
FISH ACROSS OUR FACILITIES

01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:56.812
SUMMER FILLING UP THERE'S NO

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.614
MORE CAPACITY. THAT'S GOING TO

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.049
BE AN EVEN MORE TRICKY

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:02.284
DIFFICULT DYNAMIC IF WE GET

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:02.885
INTO TWENTY TWENTY TWO LIKE IT

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:08.524
IS. I ALSO THINK IN TWENTY

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:11.460
TWENTY TWO SECOND AREA. WE'RE

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:13.496
VERY FOCUSED ON IS IF IT'S THE

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:17.299
SAME OR WORSE. BE READY TO MOVE

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:19.135
FISH LIKE WE DID THE SEVENTEEN

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:20.569
MILLION DOWN INTO THE BAY IN

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:23.672
THE ESTUARY. I'M WILLING FOR US

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:25.641
TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS IT'S

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.009
NEEDED IN THESE DARK

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:29.178
CONDITIONS. BUT I'M ALSO

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:32.214
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IF TWENTY

01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:32.848
TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:33.883
AND ARE WE GETTING OURSELVES IN

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:37.253
A POSITION OF EVERY YEAR.

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.255
LIVING DATA ANALYSIS I'M NOT

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:41.257
SURE THAT'S THE SOUNDEST

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:42.758
STRATEGY EITHER IT HAS ME

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:47.163
CONCERNED. THIRD AREA. YES NEXT

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:49.165
YEAR ASSUMPTION YOU YOUR FRIEND

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:53.102
IS AS DRYER DRYER WE HAVE A-

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:55.571
HELLO GENTLEMEN SHADOW OF

01:07:55.638 --> 01:08:00.176
ALMOST- NO WAY OUT DECISIONS WE

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:01.877
WOULD ENTER NEXT YEAR WITH

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:05.381
FULSOME OR THEY'LL- AND- SHASTA

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:07.716
AND HISTORICAL LOWS. WE WOULD

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:09.952
BE ASSUMING NO INCREASE CAUSES

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:12.455
AS DRYER DRYER WHAT DO WE DO

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:14.356
NOW IS TO COLD WATER. AND I

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.926
THINK THAT SCENARIO PUTS US AND

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:19.395
PARTICULARLY THE WATER BOARD.

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:20.496
IN A PLACE NONE OF US EVER

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:22.631
AGAIN WHAT'S IT LIKE TO HAVE

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.233
BARE MINIMUM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.069
AND SAFETY. AND NOT MUCH ELSE

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:30.840
WATER FOR ANYTHING. TO BE OPEN

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:33.676
ABOUT IT AND THAT THAT IS.

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.579
THAT'S OUTSIDE ANY. INDIVIDUAL

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.347
ON THIS PHONE CALLER PANELS

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:41.851
EXPERIENCE. YEAH I THINK THAT'S

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.752
THE MENTALITY WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.488
AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.823
AHEAD AND WHILE IT'S MIGHT

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:50.125
SOUND TRITE. I ALSO THINK IT'S

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:52.094
ANOTHER REASON WHY EVERY DROP

KLAMATH IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. IN

01:50:15.475 --> 01:50:16.910
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

01:50:16.977 --> 01:50:19.212
BUREAU'S ACTION ON THE SECOND

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:20.914

PREVIOUS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS-

01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:24.751
BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

01:50:24.818 --> 01:50:26.052
THROUGHOUT THOSE BIOLOGICAL

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.854
OPINIONS. REPLACE THEM WITH

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:29.856
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT SHARES

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:31.558

01:50:37.364 --> 01:50:39.599
EXTINCTION PLAN. AND THE STATE

01:50:39.666 --> 01:50:41.534
OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD STOP IT.

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:43.203
UNFORTUNATELY THE STATE WATER

01:50:43.269 --> 01:50:44.838
BOARD HAS PERMITTED THE

01:50:44.904 --> 01:50:46.473
BUREAU'S FISH KILL THIS YEAR.

01:50:46.539 --> 01:50:47.807
RECENTLY THE BUREAU HAS

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:49.409
CONFIRMED THAT IT'S PLANNING TO

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:51.177
HOLD EVEN LESS COLD WATER FOR

01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:52.779
SPAWNING THE SPAWNING SEASON

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:54.314
THIS YEAR THAN IT ANTICIPATED.

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:56.716
THIS THIS- REMINDS US OF

01:50:56.783 --> 01:50:58.852
EXACTLY WHAT WE HEARD IN TWENTY

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:00.220
FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE

01:51:00.286 --> 01:51:01.855
FEAR THAT THE BOARD HASN'T

01:51:01.921 --> 01:51:03.690
LEARNED A LESSON OF THOSE FISH

01:51:03.757 --> 01:51:05.325
KILLS IN THOSE YEARS. AT THE

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:06.993
TIME THE BOARD'S EXECUTIVE

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.495
OPPOSITION THOSE DECISIONS WERE

01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:10.530
A MISTAKE. BUT THE BOARD

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:12.165
FRANKLY APPEARS TO BE TREATING

01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:13.700
THESE FISH KILLS ALMOST AS

01:51:13.767 --> 01:51:15.368
BUSINESS AS USUAL THIS YEAR.

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:17.570
THIS WILL BE THE THIRD YEAR OF

01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:20.173
NEAR TOTAL LOSS OF. WILD FISH

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.241
ON THE SACRAMENTO IN EIGHT

01:51:21.307 --> 01:51:22.909
YEARS THAT'S CLEARLY

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:24.677
UNSUSTAINABLE. WE'RE NOT JUST

01:51:24.744 --> 01:51:27.213
RISKING THE EXTENSION OF THE

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.182
WINTER RUN YOU ALSO HAVE HEARD

01:51:29.249 --> 01:51:31.284

DO NOT ACTUALLY RUN FISH. ON

01:51:38.858 --> 01:51:40.693
THAT MEANS THAT THIS WINTER RUN

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:41.961
FISH KILL IS GOING TO RESULT IN

01:51:42.028 --> 01:51:44.330
MORE RESTRICTIONS ON FISHING

01:51:44.397 --> 01:51:45.899

01:53:45.852 --> 01:53:46.986
IS LIKELY BECAUSE OF THE WAY

01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:48.988
FISH MOVE IN THE OCEAN TO BE

01:53:49.055 --> 01:53:51.057

THREE TO FIVE YEARS WILL BE

02:00:18.945 --> 02:00:20.146
CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA'S

COMMERCIAL FISHING INDUSTRY. WE

02:00:22.148 --> 02:00:23.316
BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS

02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:24.684
WILL BE HELPFUL IN MAXIMIZING

02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:26.152
THE CHANCES OF A VIABLE FISHERY

02:00:26.218 --> 02:00:27.853
IN YEARS TO COME. WE FULLY

UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:49.175
IMPORTANT GIVEN THIS YEAR'S

SURVIVED. I THINK VERY OUTLINED

02:00:59.819 --> 02:01:02.321
THAT. VERY EFFECTIVELY. WE NEED

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:03.623
TO CONSIDER SOLAR PANELS THE

02:01:17.637 --> 02:01:18.638
GENERATING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:20.506
OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE NEED TO

02:01:20.573 --> 02:01:21.607
CONSIDER PROGRAM WHICH

02:01:21.674 --> 02:01:22.975
ENCOURAGE FARMERS WHOSE LANDS

02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:24.377
OTHERWISE SUBJECT BEING FILED

02:01:24.443 --> 02:01:24.877
UNDER STATE GROUNDWATER

02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:27.146
MANAGEMENT ACT. TO COVER THAT

02:01:27.213 --> 02:01:28.848
LAND TO SOLAR POWER GENERATION.

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:31.050
IN CONCLUSION. WE HOPE THIS

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.618
HEARING RESULTS IN ACTIONS.

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:34.020
WITHOUT MEANINGFUL ACTIONS IT

02:01:34.086 --> 02:01:35.154
IS NOT OUTSIDE THE REALM OF

02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:36.489
POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY LOSE

02:01:36.555 --> 02:01:38.457
ICONIC SALMON RUNS. NON TRIBAL

02:01:38.524 --> 02:01:40.092
COMMERCIAL SALMON HARVESTERS

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.327
HAVE OPERATED IN CALIFORNIA

02:01:41.394 --> 02:01:42.528
SINCE THE EARLY EIGHTEEN

02:01:42.595 --> 02:01:44.530
FIFTIES. ABSENT NECESSARY AND

02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:46.265
MEANINGFUL ACTIONS THIS FISHERY

02:01:46.332 --> 02:01:49.935
MAY NOT. SEE THE LATTER PART OF

02:01:50.002 --> 02:01:50.670
TWENTY TWENTY. THANK YOU. HIS

FEDERATION FISHERMAN'S. WE LIKE

02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:58.844
TO BE TO OPEN IT UP FOR

02:01:58.911 --> 02:01:59.812

TO GO TO MISTER NELSON- MISTER

02:02:06.552 --> 02:02:09.088
ISSUE OF THE SHASTA TEMPERATURE

02:02:09.155 --> 02:02:12.324
MANAGEMENT PLAN- LOOK. I

02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:14.160
UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE IN THIS

02:02:14.226 --> 02:02:16.295
HISTORIC DROUGHT BUT IT'S BEING

02:02:16.362 --> 02:02:17.830
MADE WORSE IN ONE OF THE MAIN

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.965
DRIVERS OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

02:02:20.032 --> 02:02:21.600
WERE SEEN AS POTENTIAL

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:24.203
EXTINCTION EVENT. ON THE

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:26.505
SACRAMENTO IS BASED OFF THOSE

02:02:26.572 --> 02:02:28.441
POLICIES IN THE PRIOR FEDERAL

02:02:28.507 --> 02:02:30.843
ADMINISTRATION SO TALK TO US

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:33.145
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

02:02:33.212 --> 02:02:35.181
THERE MAY BE SOME DISAGREEMENT.

02:02:35.247 --> 02:02:36.582
ON THAT BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND

02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:39.151
GIVE US A TWO MINUTE DEEP DIVE

02:02:39.218 --> 02:02:41.420
TWO MINUTE DEEP DIVE. ON WHY IT

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:44.990
IS SO DIZZY DISASTERS IN

02:02:45.057 --> 02:02:45.991
PARTICULAR FOR THE SACRAMENTO.

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:47.760
A COUPLE OF REASONS FIRST THANK

02:02:47.827 --> 02:02:48.627
YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIRMAN

02:02:48.694 --> 02:02:51.297
OF FIRST THE YOUR RECOGNITION

02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:53.165
RUN SHASTA DAM THE CONTROLS

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:54.600
FLOWS ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER.

02:02:54.667 --> 02:02:56.368
UNDER THE PREVIOUS BIOLOGICAL

02:02:56.435 --> 02:02:59.538
OPINION THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT

02:02:59.605 --> 02:03:02.374
THAT- THAT THE BUREAU HOLD

02:03:02.441 --> 02:03:04.443
ENOUGH COLD WATER IN STORAGE AT

02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:06.812
SHASTA DAM TO PROVIDE COLD

02:03:06.879 --> 02:03:09.148
WATER FOR OF FOR SPAWNING FISH

02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:10.916
IN THE FALL ALSO TO PROVIDE A

02:03:10.983 --> 02:03:12.418
RESERVE SO THAT THERE'S WATER

02:03:12.485 --> 02:03:14.120
SUPPLY AVAILABLE AND IN IN CASE

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:15.721
THE FOLLOWING YEAR'S DRY. BUT

02:03:15.788 --> 02:03:17.189
THOSE THINGS HAVE CHANGED

02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:19.158
DRAMATICALLY THIS THIS CURRENT

02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:21.994
BIOLOGICAL OPINION BY THE TRUMP

02:03:22.061 --> 02:03:24.330
ADMINISTRATION- HAS ELIMINATED

02:03:24.396 --> 02:03:25.798
A COUPLE THINGS COMPLETELY

02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:27.099
ELIMINATED THE COURT KERRY

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:28.400
RESTORED REQUIREMENTS SO

02:03:28.467 --> 02:03:29.835
INSTEAD OF ONE POINT NINE

02:03:29.902 --> 02:03:31.303
MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER IN

02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:33.005
STORAGE. THIS YEAR THE BUREAU

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:34.673
MAY HAVE A MILLION MAY HAVE

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:35.574
LESS THAN A MILLION ACRE FEET

02:03:35.641 --> 02:03:38.310
OF WATER ALMOST HALF OF WHAT

02:03:38.377 --> 02:03:39.812
WAS REQUIRED PREVIOUSLY THAT'S

02:03:39.879 --> 02:03:41.147
THE REASON. THERE IS AN

02:03:41.213 --> 02:03:43.449
ADEQUATE COLD WATER- AND

02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:45.618
THEY'RE RELEASING MORE WATER WE

02:03:45.684 --> 02:03:47.753
BELIEVE THEN IS- THAN SHOULD BE

02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:48.687
ALLOWED UNDER STATE

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:49.789
ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER USE

02:03:49.855 --> 02:03:51.357
LAWS HAPPY TO EXPLAIN THAT IN

02:03:51.423 --> 02:03:54.260
ADDITION SECOND. THE NEW TRUMP

02:03:54.326 --> 02:03:55.795
POLICY DOESN'T JUST ELIMINATE

02:03:55.861 --> 02:03:56.896
THE CARRYOVER STORAGE

02:03:56.962 --> 02:03:59.131
REQUIREMENTS AND THEN LEGALIZES

02:03:59.198 --> 02:04:02.134
THE FISHKILL. OF THE IN THE AND

02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:03.636
YOU MENTION THIS BRIEFLY OF

02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:05.871
THIS BIOLOGICAL OPINION ALLOWS

02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:07.406
THE BUREAU TO KILL IT'S NOT

02:04:07.473 --> 02:04:09.575
EXAGGERATION. EVERY SINGLE

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:11.343
ENDANGERED WINTER RUN SALMON

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:13.479
BELOW SHASTA DAM FOR THREE

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:14.547
YEARS RUNNING WHAT HAPPENED

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:16.182
WHAT HAPPENED THEN. IS

02:04:16.248 --> 02:04:17.616
RENEGOTIATION OF MULTI YEAR

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:19.618
INITIATION PROCESS WOULD BEGIN

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:21.954
THAT'S A PLAN FOR EXTINCTION-

02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:23.656
THE NEXT THING IT SEEMS VERY

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:24.824
ONE GIVEN INTENSELY CRITICALLY

02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:26.358
IMPORTANT IS THAT THE

02:04:26.425 --> 02:04:27.960
BIOLOGICAL OPINION ESTABLISHES

02:04:28.027 --> 02:04:29.328
THE BUREAU WAS THE FINAL

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:30.029
DECISION MAKER OF THEIR

02:04:30.095 --> 02:04:31.831
OPERATIONS. ACTUALLY DOESN'T

02:04:31.897 --> 02:04:33.833
GIVE FEDERAL BIOLOGISTS AT THE

02:04:33.899 --> 02:04:35.768
NATIONAL FISHERIES SERVICE THE

02:04:35.835 --> 02:04:37.536
ABILITY TO SAY THAT'S NOT GOOD

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:38.904
ENOUGH YOU CAN'T IMPLEMENT THAT

02:04:38.971 --> 02:04:39.839
PLAN YOU HAVE TO BETTER FOR

02:04:39.905 --> 02:04:41.307
SALMON THOSE ENDANGERED SALMON

02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:42.975
PARTICULAR YOU HAVE THOSE THREE

02:04:43.042 --> 02:04:44.243
THINGS TOGETHER AND IT REALLY

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:46.111
IS AN EXTENSION PLAN. WE'RE

02:04:46.178 --> 02:04:48.380
VERY CONCERNED- MR BOTTOMS

02:04:48.447 --> 02:04:50.783
RIGHT THAT THE FEDERAL

02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:52.551
GOVERNMENT DID SAY WILL BEGIN

02:04:52.618 --> 02:04:54.553
CONSULTATION IN OCTOBER FRANKLY

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:56.488
THAT'S TOO LATE. WE'RE ALSO

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:57.556
CONCERNED THAT THE FEDERAL

02:04:57.623 --> 02:04:59.992
GOVERNMENT CITED ONE REASON FOR

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:02.261
DELAYING RE CONSULTATION. IS A

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:03.329
CALL VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:05.464
PROCESS THE PROCESS THAT HAS

02:05:05.531 --> 02:05:08.067
FAILED FOR YEARS IT'S FAILED

02:05:08.133 --> 02:05:09.201
FOR TO GET FOUR CONSECUTIVE

02:05:09.268 --> 02:05:11.337
DEADLINES ABOUT TO FEEL THE HIT

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:14.173
ITS FIFTH DEADLINE- SO WE'RE

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:16.342
DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THOSE.

02:05:16.408 --> 02:05:18.244
ANTIQUATED ANTI ENVIRONMENTAL

02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:20.713
ANTI SALMON ANTI TRIBAL ALL OF

02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:25.317
TRUMP. WATER POLICIES ARE STILL

02:05:25.384 --> 02:05:25.918
IN PLACE AND THE PROCESS OF RE

02:05:25.985 --> 02:05:26.886
WRITE THOSE FOLLOW. IS MOVING

02:05:26.952 --> 02:05:28.554
VERY SLOW NO THANK YOU SO MUCH

02:05:28.621 --> 02:05:30.122
AND FOR THE DEEP DIVE AT BURY

02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:31.657
NELSON GOLDEN STATE SENATE SO.

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:33.225

CONCERN IS WHILE WE MAY BE SEEN

02:05:38.297 --> 02:05:41.066
A GOOD YEAR THIS YEAR RIGHT-

02:05:41.133 --> 02:05:43.369
IT'S BASED OFF OF. PREVIOUS

02:05:43.435 --> 02:05:46.438
YEARS IN EVEN IF WE WENT WHEN.

02:05:46.505 --> 02:05:48.340
THE SALMON GO TO SPAWN IN THEIR

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:50.943
HOME STREAM THOSE AIDES VERY

02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:52.945
LIKELY TO BE COOKED BASED OFF

02:05:53.012 --> 02:05:54.046
OF THE CHALLENGE WATER

02:05:54.113 --> 02:05:55.581
CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE. SO

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:58.651
WHILE WE SEE A GOOD YEAR-

02:05:58.717 --> 02:06:01.387
MISTER NELSON FIRST- THOSE EGGS

02:06:01.453 --> 02:06:04.223
THAT. MAY BE COMING- WILL MOST

02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:06.125
LIKELY BE COOKED HERE. IN THE

02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:07.293
CONDITIONS THAT WERE SEEN WHICH

02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:09.795
IS GOING TO. EXACERBATE THE

02:06:09.862 --> 02:06:13.332
ISSUE OF- BAD STOCK HERE IN

02:06:13.399 --> 02:06:14.967
OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS MR

02:06:15.034 --> 02:06:17.036
NELSON IN A NO GO TO MR CONROY.

02:06:17.102 --> 02:06:18.237
E. L. FIRST I WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:06:18.304 --> 02:06:21.173
I KNOW IN MY COUNTER WILL WILL

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:22.875
UPDATE THIS EVEN MORE. ON THAT

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:24.310
THIS YEAR IS IN A GOOD YEAR THE

02:06:24.376 --> 02:06:26.412
FLEET BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF

02:06:26.478 --> 02:06:28.514
THE RUNS. ARE IN THE ADULT

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:30.015
POPULATION OF THE OCEAN AND

02:06:30.082 --> 02:06:31.050
THIS IS THE FLEE THE SAME

02:06:31.116 --> 02:06:33.552
COMMERCIAL FLEE THE SCENE IT'S-

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:35.387
IT'S- TIME ON THE WATER

02:06:35.454 --> 02:06:36.855
FISHING. CUT BY ALMOST TWO

02:06:36.922 --> 02:06:38.324
THIRDS THIS YEAR AND IN THE

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:39.224
NORTHERN PART OF STATE SHUT

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:40.893
DOWN ENTIRELY BUT BUT IT IS

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:42.127
TRUE THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:43.562
FISHING IS GOOD OUT THERE.

02:06:43.629 --> 02:06:46.098
THAT'S ENTIRELY BECAUSE OF

02:06:46.165 --> 02:06:48.434
HATCHERY PRODUCTION AND-

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:49.868
TRUCKING OF FISH WERE VERY

02:06:49.935 --> 02:06:52.137
CONCERNED ABOUT RETURNS AS MR

02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:55.040
STONE MANSION- AND- AND- AND

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:57.643
THE AGENCIES FACE A REALLY.

02:06:57.710 --> 02:06:59.345
DISMAL PROSPECT THIS YEAR HAVE

02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:01.613
FACED THIS YEAR ALL THEY COULD

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:04.350
EITHER TRUCK FISH- WHICH NONE

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:06.418
OF US OF. WHAT WE ALL OF US

02:07:06.485 --> 02:07:08.954
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HEALTHY. IN

02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:10.222
RIVER RUNS AND REDUCED AND

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.824
RELEASES IN THE RIVER FOR

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:13.692
HATCHERIES- BUT THEY'LL TURN IT

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:15.327
WAS TO RELEASE THOSE FISH THE

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:16.362
TO THE RIVERS AND SIMPLY LET

02:07:16.428 --> 02:07:18.030
THEM DIE- SO WE'RE VERY

02:07:18.097 --> 02:07:20.332
CONCERNED THAT THE FISH. THAT

02:07:20.399 --> 02:07:22.101
ESCAPED TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:07:22.167 --> 02:07:23.702
THIS YEAR AND WE HOPE THIS YEAR

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:25.804
WE GET OUR ESCAPEMENT TARGET-

02:07:25.871 --> 02:07:27.606
OF FACE REALLY DIRE CONDITIONS

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:29.408
THIS YEAR AND WE COULD FACE.

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:31.210
SIMILAR HATCHERY CONDITIONS

02:07:31.276 --> 02:07:32.578
NEXT YEAR AND UNTIL HIS TRUCK

02:07:32.644 --> 02:07:34.480
BOTTOM SET UNTIL WE REBUILD OF

02:07:34.546 --> 02:07:37.282
THOSE WILD RUNS UNTIL WE DECIDE

02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:39.251
TO PROTECT OUR RIVERS. WE THINK

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:40.886
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE THE

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:41.887
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE

02:07:41.954 --> 02:07:49.395
FISHERY BUT CERTAIN- BUT- DRUG.

02:07:49.461 --> 02:07:49.995
SUMMER FISHING IT'S IMPORTANT

02:07:50.062 --> 02:07:51.030
ALSO THAT WE WERE M. THAT ALL

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:51.997
OF OUR HANDS AND OTHER SAME

02:07:52.064 --> 02:07:53.399
HAVE. THAT SOME OF OUR- CAN BE

02:07:53.465 --> 02:07:54.199
TRIED IN TRUCK TO THOSE WEST

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:55.501
LOCATION WITHOUT WITHOUT

02:07:55.567 --> 02:07:56.735
INCREASING STRAIGHT RIGHTS.

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:57.669
COMMISSION ASSEN THAT'S GONNA

02:07:57.736 --> 02:08:00.506
MISTER CONROY. WHAT I'M TRYING

02:08:00.572 --> 02:08:02.608
TO THINK OF A SOMETHING TO ADD

SACRAMENTO RIVER. THIS HIGH

02:22:33.945 --> 02:22:35.647
DEATH RATE IS NOT INEVITABLE

02:22:35.713 --> 02:22:37.248
NOR THE RESULT OF A NATURAL

SURPRISE. INSTEAD PRIMARILY DUE

02:22:42.453 --> 02:22:43.121
TO MISMANAGEMENT OF OUR WATER

CALIFORNIA'S NATIONAL WILDLIFE.

02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:00.438
THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS THE

02:23:00.505 --> 02:23:03.608
AUTHORITY TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS.

02:23:03.675 --> 02:23:05.276
COULD HE NOW GRAYSON TO PROTECT

THE COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT FALL

RUNS. UNFORTUNATELY THE BOARD

02:23:10.114 --> 02:23:11.549
HAS DONE LITTLE TO EXERCISE ITS

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:12.750
CONSIDERABLE AUTHORITY TO

IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR SALMON

02:23:13.851 --> 02:23:16.654
THIS YEAR. AS WE HEARD FROM THE

SO BACK. SHE STATED THAT THE

02:23:19.324 --> 02:23:20.825
STATE BOARD HAS WORKED TO

PROTECT TO THE COLD WATER POOL

02:23:22.327 --> 02:23:24.862
ENTRANCE TO THIS YEAR. WELL YOU

02:23:24.929 --> 02:23:26.731
KNOW AS WE CAN ALL SEE FROM THE

SORRY STATE OF THE COLD WATER

02:23:28.866 --> 02:23:31.836
PULLING SHOTS DOWN. ABOUT HALF

02:23:31.903 --> 02:23:33.538
HEARTED EFFORT AS BAIL. AND AS

02:23:33.604 --> 02:23:35.740
A RESULT FISHING COMMUNITIES

INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND EVERYONE

02:23:37.275 --> 02:23:39.143
ELSE WHO CARE ABOUT SALMON AND

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:40.144
HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS THEY

02:23:40.211 --> 02:23:41.479
NURTURE. WILL SUFFER THE

02:23:41.546 --> 02:23:43.648
CONSEQUENCES OF THE BOARD'S

02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:45.984
INACTION FOR YEARS TO COME.

02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:49.287
GENERALLY ON THE SACRAMENTO

02:23:49.354 --> 02:23:50.655
TEMPERATURES ABOVE FIFTY SIX

02:23:50.722 --> 02:23:53.324
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. OUR LEAD

02:23:53.391 --> 02:23:55.259
OFFER SHINNOK EGGS AND FRY AND

02:23:55.326 --> 02:23:57.362
WATER TEMPERATURES ABOUT FIFTY

02:23:57.428 --> 02:23:59.130
THREE POINT FIVE DEGREES ARE

LETHAL TO ENDANGERED WINTER RUN

02:24:01.532 --> 02:24:03.668
CHINOOK SALMON X. THIS YEAR AT

02:24:03.735 --> 02:24:04.969
THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION WHICH

02:24:05.036 --> 02:24:07.171
OPERATES SHASTA DAM IS ON TRACK

02:24:07.238 --> 02:24:08.673
TO EXCEED THOSE TEMPERATURE

02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:10.775
THRESHOLDS. ON THE SACRAMENTO

02:24:10.842 --> 02:24:15.480
RIVER. STARTING NEXT MONTH AND-

02:24:15.546 --> 02:24:17.548
ARE CONTINUING TO EXCEED THEM

02:24:17.615 --> 02:24:19.884
THROUGH NOVEMBER. THAT IS THE

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:23.021
PERIOD WHEN- THE EX OF BOTH

02:24:23.087 --> 02:24:25.523
WINTER RUN AND FALL RUN CHINOOK

02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:29.360
NEED COLD WATER TO SURVIVE. THE

02:24:29.427 --> 02:24:30.328
SALMON DOESN'T HIGH

02:24:30.395 --> 02:24:32.296
TEMPERATURES COULD BE AVOIDED

02:24:32.363 --> 02:24:34.265
IF RECLAMATION REDUCED WATER

02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:36.034
DELIVERIES TO THEIR CONTRACTORS

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:37.502
MAINTAIN A HIGHER LEVEL OF

02:24:37.568 --> 02:24:38.936
WATER STORAGE IN CHASTAIN

02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:41.205
CONSERVED MORE COLD WATER IN

02:24:41.272 --> 02:24:43.241
THE BOTTOM OF THE RESERVOIR.

02:24:43.307 --> 02:24:44.942
RECLAMATION IS LARGELY DRAIN

02:24:45.009 --> 02:24:46.544
THE RESERVOIR IN ORDER TO

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:47.945
MAXIMIZE WATER DELIVERIES TO

02:24:48.012 --> 02:24:50.648
ITS CONTRACT. THOSE DELIVERIES

02:24:50.715 --> 02:24:52.183
ARE ON TRACK TO EXCEED THREE

02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:54.052
POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET

02:24:54.118 --> 02:24:55.753
THIS YEAR MOSTLY TO

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:58.823
AGRIBUSINESS. THAT BRINGS US

02:24:58.890 --> 02:25:00.425
BACK TO THE STATE WATER BOARD

02:25:00.491 --> 02:25:02.226
WHICH HAS TO OUR REVIEW AND

02:25:02.293 --> 02:25:04.028
APPROVE RECLAMATION'S

02:25:04.095 --> 02:25:05.496
TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR

02:25:05.563 --> 02:25:07.598
SHASTA EVERY YEAR UNDER

02:25:07.665 --> 02:25:09.067
RECLAMATION STATE WATER RATES

02:25:09.133 --> 02:25:11.869
PERMITS. BECAUSE OF BAD

02:25:11.936 --> 02:25:13.571
AUTHORITY THE STATE WATER BOARD

02:25:13.638 --> 02:25:15.473
KIND OF REQUIRED RECLAMATION TO

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:16.974
OPERATE SHASTA VERY DIFFERENTLY

02:25:17.041 --> 02:25:20.211
THIS YEAR. TO REDUCE RELEASES

02:25:20.278 --> 02:25:22.080
OVER THE SUMMER AND INCREASE

02:25:22.146 --> 02:25:24.348
THE SIZE OF THE COLD WATER POOL.

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:26.384
IN FACT THE WATER BOARD HAD

02:25:26.451 --> 02:25:28.553
EXTENSIVE INFORMATION FROM THE

02:25:28.619 --> 02:25:29.420
NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:32.023
SERVICE MUCHEARLIER THIS YEAR

02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:34.625
CHINA COULD HAVE SAVED 50% OF

02:25:34.692 --> 02:25:36.994
THE WINNER RUN X. AND FRIED.

02:25:37.061 --> 02:25:38.296
AND INCREASED FOREIGN SURVIVAL

02:25:38.362 --> 02:25:41.299
IF IT FOLLOWED THIS PROTOCOL.

02:25:41.365 --> 02:25:42.700
BUT INSTEAD OF THE WATER BOARD

02:25:42.767 --> 02:25:44.535
CHOSE TO ALLOW RECLAMATION TO

02:25:44.602 --> 02:25:46.370
OPERATE SHASTA IN A WAY THAT'S

02:25:46.437 --> 02:25:48.473
LIKELY TO WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE

02:25:48.539 --> 02:25:52.944
RUN. EVEN WORSE THE BUREAU IS

02:25:53.010 --> 02:25:55.847
FAILING TO MEET THE PLAN. THAT

02:25:55.913 --> 02:25:58.282
THE BOARD APPROVED IN JUNE.

02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:59.050
DRAINING THE RESERVOIR EVEN

02:25:59.117 --> 02:26:00.952
FURTHER AND THREATENING TO

02:26:01.018 --> 02:26:02.787
LEAVE CALIFORNIA WITHOUT

02:26:02.854 --> 02:26:04.021
ADEQUATE WATER FOR HEALTH AND

02:26:04.088 --> 02:26:08.025
SAFETY IF NEXT YEAR IS STRONG.

02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:09.460
ASSEMBLY NONE OF THIS IS A

02:26:09.527 --> 02:26:11.028
SURPRISE WE SAW SIMILAR

02:26:11.095 --> 02:26:13.030
MISMANAGEMENT DURING THE TWENTY

02:26:13.097 --> 02:26:13.865
FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN

02:26:13.931 --> 02:26:15.066
DROUGHT WHEN RECLAMATION

02:26:15.133 --> 02:26:16.801
OPERATED SHASTA TO DRAIN ITS

02:26:16.868 --> 02:26:19.070
COLD WATER POOL. LEADING TO

02:26:19.137 --> 02:26:21.305
NEAR TOTAL MORTALITY OF WINTER

02:26:21.372 --> 02:26:24.008
RUN IN BOTH OF THOSE YEAR. AND

02:26:24.075 --> 02:26:26.077
AGAIN THIS IS NOT AN INEVITABLE

02:26:26.144 --> 02:26:28.179
FUNCTION OF HYDROLOGY AND

02:26:28.246 --> 02:26:30.381
TEMPERATURE. THIS WAS THE

02:26:30.448 --> 02:26:32.150
CHOICE THAT STATE AND FEDERAL

02:26:32.216 --> 02:26:34.418
AGENCIES MADE FOLLOWING THE

02:26:34.485 --> 02:26:35.419
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

02:26:35.486 --> 02:26:37.188
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WHICH

02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:40.291
LEGALIZED KILLING 1100% OF THE

02:26:40.358 --> 02:26:40.791
ENDANGERED SALMON IN THE

02:26:40.858 --> 02:26:44.128
SACRAMENTO. THIS YEAR SOUNDS

02:26:44.195 --> 02:26:46.197
WATER IS ALSO A SYMPTOM OF THE

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:47.999
ON GOING FAILURE OF THE STATE

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:53.905
WATER BOARD. SIX STANDARDS

02:26:53.971 --> 02:26:55.106
WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN MEANINGFULLY

02:26:55.173 --> 02:26:58.509
UPDATED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY

02:26:58.576 --> 02:26:59.076
FIVE AND ARE WOEFULLY OUT OF

02:26:59.143 --> 02:27:02.547
DATE. THE STATE KIND OF WIND

02:27:02.613 --> 02:27:04.348
THIS RECURRING DROUGHT CRISIS

02:27:04.415 --> 02:27:06.450
IN THE FUTURE BY UPDATING THOSE

02:27:06.517 --> 02:27:08.386
WATER QUALITY STANDARDS TO

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:10.288
REFLECT CURRENT INVEST NOBLE

02:27:10.354 --> 02:27:12.490
SCIENCE AND TO ACTUALLY PLAN

02:27:12.557 --> 02:27:14.292
FOR DROUGHT MAKING SIGNIFICANT

02:27:14.358 --> 02:27:15.793
CHANGES TO THE WAY SHASTA IS

02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:18.162
MANAGED TO ACCOUNT FOR CLIMATE

02:27:18.229 --> 02:27:20.731
CHANGE AND PREVENT THE

02:27:20.798 --> 02:27:23.034
EXTINCTION OF OUR SALMON RUNS.

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:25.002
AND FINALLY I WANT TO COMMENT

02:27:25.069 --> 02:27:27.205
ON SOMETHING THAT I DIRECTOR

02:27:27.271 --> 02:27:29.840
BONHAM SAID- BECAUSE HE

02:27:29.907 --> 02:27:31.876
INDICATED THAT THE FEDERAL

02:27:31.943 --> 02:27:35.079
GOVERNMENT IS NOW ON TRACK TO

02:27:35.146 --> 02:27:37.081
WITHDRAW THESE FROM BIOLOGICAL

02:27:37.148 --> 02:27:39.317
OPINIONS AND REWRITE- AND

02:27:39.383 --> 02:27:41.886
THAT'S NOT REALLY ACCURATE-

02:27:41.953 --> 02:27:43.854
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

02:27:43.921 --> 02:27:47.658
SADDENED. IS THAT THEY WILL-

02:27:47.725 --> 02:27:49.227
START THE PROCESS IN A FEW

02:27:49.293 --> 02:27:52.697
MONTHS. TO DEVELOP NEW OR

02:27:52.763 --> 02:27:55.333
AMENDED BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS

02:27:55.399 --> 02:27:57.435
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

02:27:57.501 --> 02:27:59.203
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE AMENDED

02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:01.305
ALL OF THE TIME AND TWEAKING

02:28:01.372 --> 02:28:03.641
AROUND THE EDGES THIS IS NOT

02:28:03.708 --> 02:28:05.343
GOING TO SOLVE THE WHOLESALE

02:28:05.409 --> 02:28:08.079
ABDICATION OF SCIENCE EMBEDDED

02:28:08.145 --> 02:28:08.613
IN THESE TRUMP BIOLOGICAL

02:28:08.679 --> 02:28:11.749
OPINIONS. WE NEED A COMMITMENT

02:28:11.816 --> 02:28:13.184
TO DROPPED ENTIRELY NEW

02:28:13.251 --> 02:28:14.885
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT ARE

02:28:14.952 --> 02:28:17.822
BASED ON SOUND SCIENCE AND WE

02:28:17.888 --> 02:28:19.657
NEED THE STATE TO INCEST. BUT

02:28:19.724 --> 02:28:21.692
THE BUREAU AGREED TO BE COVERED

02:28:21.759 --> 02:28:23.261
UNDER CALIFORNIA'S ENDANGERED

DO THEIR JOB. AND DO IT IN A

02:39:48.478 --> 02:39:50.881
TIMELY FASHION- THEY UNDERSTOOD

02:39:50.948 --> 02:39:53.116
OUR AGENCY LAST AUGUST AND

02:39:53.183 --> 02:39:55.152
AGAIN IN JANUARY WHEN WE FILED

CERTAINLY WHAT WE SEE THE

02:40:21.278 --> 02:40:23.213
BIGGEST NEED IS EVOLVING OUR

02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:24.748
WATER RIGHTS REGULATORY

02:40:24.815 --> 02:40:26.817
PROCESS. WHICH WE BELIEVE IS

02:40:26.883 --> 02:40:29.386
INHERENTLY INEQUITABLE. AND

02:40:29.453 --> 02:40:31.254
AVOID VIOLATIONS OF THE PUBLIC

02:40:31.321 --> 02:40:33.056
TRUST DOCTRINE BY ALLOCATING

02:40:33.123 --> 02:40:36.593
WATER TO FISH FIRST. AND THEN.

02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:38.395
GOING FROM THERE IT'S ONE THING

02:40:38.462 --> 02:40:40.430
TO SET MINIMUM FLOWS IT'S

02:40:40.497 --> 02:40:41.264
ANOTHER TO HAVE WATER TO

02:40:41.331 --> 02:40:43.100
BACK THAT UP. WE ALSO NEED TO

02:40:43.166 --> 02:40:45.102
REQUIRE ALL WATER USERS TO

02:40:45.168 --> 02:40:46.970
REPORT WATER USE IN REAL TIME

02:40:47.037 --> 02:40:48.772
SO WE CAN BETTER COORDINATE USE

02:40:48.839 --> 02:40:51.875
AND CANCER STORAGE. AND ALLOW

02:40:51.942 --> 02:40:54.277
PEOPLE TO USE WATER. WE NEED TO

02:40:54.344 --> 02:40:55.278
GET THE WATER BOARD NON

02:40:55.345 --> 02:40:57.014
DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO DO

02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:59.649
THEIR JOB. FREE OF POLITICAL

TO REQUIRED DEMAND REDUCTIONS.

02:41:05.455 --> 02:41:06.957
BEFORE OUR LAKES RUN OUT OF

WATER FOR THIS CALL WATER

02:41:09.526 --> 02:41:11.561

02:41:11.628 --> 02:41:13.130

02:41:13.196 --> 02:41:14.998
DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS AND I

02:41:15.065 --> 02:41:16.199
LOVE THE IDEAS OF HAVING A

DROUGHT- UNIT AND EVERYTHING.

02:41:19.336 --> 02:41:21.138
WE NEED TO CHANGE NOT ONLY HOW

02:41:21.204 --> 02:41:22.839
WE DO OUR POLICY BUT HOW WE

02:41:22.906 --> 02:41:24.775

CONSTANTLY DEMAND FURTHER

02:41:30.981 --> 02:41:32.516
REDUCTION IN FEES AND THEY

02:41:32.582 --> 02:41:34.051
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO DO

02:41:34.117 --> 02:41:35.519
THEIR JOB IN A TIMELY MANNER TO

ARMY OUR WHOLE ECONOMY IS BASED

02:41:48.198 --> 02:41:49.866
ON WATER BEING AVAILABLE AND IF

WE MISS MANAGE IT IT'S NOT

02:41:51.201 --> 02:41:52.402
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR

02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:54.604
EITHER PEOPLE OR FISH. SO WE

02:41:54.671 --> 02:41:56.506
NEED TO INVEST IN BETTER WATER

02:41:56.573 --> 02:41:59.009
RIGHTS MANAGEMENT. AND WE NEED

RETAIN WATER SO IMPORTANT- I

02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:05.148

NOT GOING TO DO IT WE NEED TO

02:42:19.663 --> 02:42:22.332
LOOK FOR WORDS. AND WE NEED TO

02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:25.302
BRING OUR- WATER RIGHTS-

ENHANCED THAT WOULD RESULT IN A

02:43:26.663 --> 02:43:28.198
MORE RESILIENT WATER SYSTEM

02:43:28.265 --> 02:43:29.900
THERE ESPECIALLY. FOR THE

COUNTY- CINEMA WATERS THEY CALL

02:43:39.776 --> 02:43:42.245
THEMSELVES TODAY- THEY ARE

02:43:42.312 --> 02:43:43.980
POURING A LOT OF RESOURCES AND

02:43:44.047 --> 02:43:45.916
YOU REALLY ARE PERFORMING HOW

02:43:45.982 --> 02:43:48.318
THEY MANAGE RESERVOIR RELEASES.

02:43:48.385 --> 02:43:49.920
AND THEIR FORECAST INFORMED

02:43:49.986 --> 02:43:51.821
RESERVOIR OPERATIONS. REALLY

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:54.558
DID PUT US IN A BETTER PLACE-

02:43:54.624 --> 02:43:56.393
COMING OUT OF THAT FLOOD YEAR

02:43:56.459 --> 02:43:59.462
AND GOING INTO TWENTY TWENTY-

02:43:59.529 --> 02:44:02.098
WHAT OPPORTUNITY WE MISSED WAS

02:44:02.165 --> 02:44:05.435
MORE BASED ON HOW THE STATE-

02:44:05.502 --> 02:44:06.970
STATE REQUIREMENTS AND STATES

02:44:07.037 --> 02:44:09.839
LOW MINIMUMS- THAT REQUIRED US

02:44:09.906 --> 02:44:11.641
TO. RELEASE MORE WATER THAN WE

02:44:11.708 --> 02:44:15.111
WERE USING. AND UNNECESSARILY

02:44:15.178 --> 02:44:17.948
LET ESSENTIALLY IT WAS ABOUT

02:44:18.014 --> 02:44:19.282
ELEVEN TWELVE MAY BE MORE

02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:20.984
THOUSAND ACRE FEET BUT- WE WERE

02:44:21.051 --> 02:44:22.886
LOOKING AT HOW MUCH WATER WAS

02:44:22.953 --> 02:44:26.056
BEING RELEASED AND ACCESS- OF

02:44:26.122 --> 02:44:28.358
WHAT WAS BEING USED AND HITTING

02:44:28.425 --> 02:44:30.961
OUR FLOW MINIMUMS. AND BY

02:44:31.027 --> 02:44:33.530
COMPRESSING THAT. OFFER WE CAN

02:44:33.597 --> 02:44:35.232
REALLY DO A BETTER JOB AND A

02:44:35.298 --> 02:44:37.367
BIG PART OF THAT IS THE WATER

02:44:37.434 --> 02:44:39.269
AGENCY IS. RUNNING THIS

02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:41.071
SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM COMPLETELY

02:44:41.137 --> 02:44:44.407
BLIND. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHICH

02:44:44.474 --> 02:44:45.742
ONE OF THE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED

02:44:45.809 --> 02:44:46.676

RUSSIAN RIVER IS DOING IT WHEN.

02:44:50.447 --> 02:44:51.615
SO THEY'RE DUMPING ALL THIS

02:44:51.681 --> 02:44:53.149
WATER IN THE RIVER TRYING TO

02:44:53.216 --> 02:44:55.085
MEET A FLOW COMPLIANCE POINT

02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:57.354
NINETY MILES DOWNSTREAM I MEAN

02:44:57.420 --> 02:44:58.989
THAT SEVENTY MILES DOWNSTREAM.

02:44:59.055 --> 02:45:00.991
AND IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND

02:45:01.057 --> 02:45:02.726
THAT'S WHY REAL TIME REPORTING.

02:45:02.792 --> 02:45:04.461

A LOT MORE WATER. THE OTHER

02:45:15.472 --> 02:45:17.173
THING IS- IN YEARS LAST YEAR

WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THAT HIGH

02:45:24.581 --> 02:45:26.983
TENSION. THINGS ARE BETTER FOR

02:45:27.050 --> 02:45:28.652

REPORTING THAT'S CRITICALLY

02:46:30.613 --> 02:46:32.949
IMPORTANT WE- THE SAME AS THE

02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:34.651
RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED IN THE

02:46:34.718 --> 02:46:37.887
BAY DELTA WATERSHED- REGULATORS

02:46:37.954 --> 02:46:40.090
HAD VERY LITTLE IDEA ABOUT WHAT

02:46:40.156 --> 02:46:42.392
IS BEING WITHDRAWN LAND AND

02:46:42.459 --> 02:46:44.461
THAT MAKES IT JUST. VERY

02:46:44.527 --> 02:46:45.328
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE SYSTEM

02:46:45.395 --> 02:46:52.402
WELL SECOND WE- OUR NEED TO

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:55.438
UPDATE OUTDATED STANDARDS WE

02:46:55.505 --> 02:46:58.942
ARE RELYING ON YOU KNOW TWENTY

02:46:59.008 --> 02:47:01.244
FIVE YEAR OLD STANDARDS THAT

02:47:01.311 --> 02:47:03.380
WERE WRITTEN BEFORE THE

02:47:03.446 --> 02:47:04.781
COLLAPSE OF THE BAY DELTA

02:47:04.848 --> 02:47:06.383
ECOSYSTEM AND MANY OF ITS

02:47:06.449 --> 02:47:07.784
NATIVE BASH AND THEY'RE JUST

02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:10.086
MOSTLY OUT OF DATE AND THE

02:47:10.153 --> 02:47:12.422
STATE BOARD HAS BEEN WORKING

02:47:12.489 --> 02:47:15.759
ON- THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR

02:47:15.825 --> 02:47:17.093
OBTAINING THOSE STANDARDS AND

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:19.129
WE NEED TO LET THEM DO THEIR

02:47:19.195 --> 02:47:20.930
JOB AND GET IT DONE QUICKLY

02:47:20.997 --> 02:47:23.133
BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE.

02:47:23.199 --> 02:47:26.436
WELL MODERN REQUIREMENTS FOR

02:47:26.503 --> 02:47:27.771
WHAT THE ECOSYSTEM NEEDS TO

02:47:27.837 --> 02:47:32.308
HEAL. I HEARD IT WE REALLY NEED

02:47:32.375 --> 02:47:35.745
TO INVEST IN ALTERNATIVES TO

02:47:35.812 --> 02:47:37.347
TAKING MORE WATER FROM OUR

02:47:37.414 --> 02:47:40.283
RIVERS- YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL

02:47:40.350 --> 02:47:41.885
SORT OF FOLLOWING THIS

02:47:41.951 --> 02:47:43.987
TWENTIETH CENTURY PATTERN OF

02:47:44.053 --> 02:47:45.522
THINKING THAT WE CAN JUST STICK

02:47:45.588 --> 02:47:47.724
MORE STRAWSON AND TAKE MORE OUT

02:47:47.791 --> 02:47:50.560
AND WE ARE WELL BEYOND THE

02:47:50.627 --> 02:47:52.228
CARRYING CAPACITY OF OUR RIVERS

02:47:52.295 --> 02:47:54.197
AND MANAGE THAT BUT THE GOOD

02:47:54.264 --> 02:47:56.633
NEWS IS WE HAVE TREMENDOUS

02:47:56.699 --> 02:48:00.503
CAPACITY TO RECYCLE MORE WATER

02:48:00.570 --> 02:48:02.305
THAT'S CURRENTLY. TREATED AND

02:48:02.372 --> 02:48:04.974
DUMPED INTO OUR OCEANS WE HAVE

02:48:05.041 --> 02:48:06.876
TREMENDOUS CAPACITY STILL TO

02:48:06.943 --> 02:48:09.412
IMPROVE AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN

02:48:09.479 --> 02:48:12.382
WATER USE EFFICIENCY- YOU KNOW

02:48:12.449 --> 02:48:15.385
MUCH OF THE DELIVERIES THAT ARE

02:48:15.452 --> 02:48:18.054
GOING TO AGRIBUSINESS IN THE

02:48:18.121 --> 02:48:19.923
SACRAMENTO VALLEY THIS YEAR OR

02:48:19.989 --> 02:48:22.559
TO FLOOD IRRIGATE LITERALLY

02:48:22.625 --> 02:48:24.127
HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES OF

02:48:24.194 --> 02:48:26.463
RICE FARMS. WE SHOULD BE DOING

02:48:26.529 --> 02:48:28.131
FLOOD IRRIGATION AND CERTAINLY

02:48:28.198 --> 02:48:31.534
NOT IN A YEAR LIKE THIS ONE- WE

02:48:31.601 --> 02:48:32.936
SHOULD GROW OTHER CROPS THAT

02:48:33.002 --> 02:48:36.039
ARE JUST WATER THIRSTY AND- WE

02:48:36.105 --> 02:48:38.441
CAN DO A LOT IN TERMS OF URBAN

02:48:38.508 --> 02:48:40.610
STORM WATER CAPTURE AS WELL

02:48:40.677 --> 02:48:41.778
THERE'S A REASON THAT SOUTHERN

02:48:41.845 --> 02:48:43.279
CALIFORNIA IS DOING MUCH

02:48:43.346 --> 02:48:44.647
BETTER. IN THE STRUPP AND

02:48:44.714 --> 02:48:46.349
REDDING CALIFORNIA AND IT'S NOT

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:47.383
BECAUSE THEY GOT A LOT MORE

02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:50.220
RAIN IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE

02:48:50.286 --> 02:48:52.021
SPENT THE LAST THREE DECADES

02:48:52.088 --> 02:48:54.724
INVESTING IN THESE ALTERNATIVE.

02:48:54.791 --> 02:48:56.893
REGIONAL WATER SUPPLIES TO

02:48:56.960 --> 02:48:58.595
TAKING MORE OUT OF OUR RIVERS

02:48:58.661 --> 02:49:00.930
AND WERE BEHIND UPSTATE AND WE

02:49:00.997 --> 02:49:02.465
GOT TO CATCH UP AND WE NEED TO

02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:06.636
INVEST QUICKLY AND HEAVILY AND

02:49:06.703 --> 02:49:07.971
ALSO TURN INTO SUPPLIES. YOU SO

CALIFORNIA WITH THE LIFECYCLE

02:49:45.642 --> 02:49:46.943
OF ABOUT THREE YEARS THAT

02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:47.911
WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE THAT

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:49.145
USED TO BE MUCH MORE DIVERSITY

02:49:49.212 --> 02:49:51.514
IN THE LIFE HISTORY. THANKS FOR

REALLY LARGE FIX THE ROOF.

02:49:54.517 --> 02:49:56.452
LARGELY LOST. NOW THEY'RE STUCK

02:49:56.519 --> 02:49:57.220
WITH THESE FISH THEY'RE

02:49:57.287 --> 02:49:58.922
ALTERING SAME THING IN THE

02:49:58.988 --> 02:50:01.491
COMING BACK EVERY THREE YEARS.

02:50:01.558 --> 02:50:02.191
THOSE FIRST LOST A LOT OF

02:50:02.258 --> 02:50:04.260
FLEXIBILITY. HOWEVER THEY

02:50:04.327 --> 02:50:06.596
RETAIN THE POTENTIAL. TO TAKE

02:50:06.663 --> 02:50:08.231
ADVANTAGE OF REALLY GOOD YEARS

02:50:08.298 --> 02:50:10.166
WHEN THERE ARE WAIT YEARS. WE

02:50:10.233 --> 02:50:11.134
NEED TO ALLOW THEM THE

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:12.769
OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK INTO

02:50:12.835 --> 02:50:14.671
HABITATS THAT ARE ONLY

02:50:14.737 --> 02:50:15.138
ACCESSIBLE UNDER THOSE

02:50:15.204 --> 02:50:17.173
CONDITIONS. THAT'S SORT OF HOW

02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:20.343
THEY EVOLVE TO ADAPT TO THIS

02:50:20.410 --> 02:50:22.011
CLIMATE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:50:22.078 --> 02:50:24.047
THROUGHOUT THE MILLENNIA I

02:50:24.113 --> 02:50:25.515
THINK WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY

02:50:25.582 --> 02:50:26.649
PRESENTS ITSELF AS WE NEED TO

02:50:26.716 --> 02:50:28.418
HAVE A WATER SYSTEM THAT WATER

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:30.820
RIGHTS BETTER FLEXIBLE ENOUGH

02:50:30.887 --> 02:50:32.388
TO ALLOW THOSE FISH ACCESS BACK

02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:34.090
INTO THOSE HABITATS. TO TAKE

02:50:34.157 --> 02:50:35.725
ADVANTAGE OF THOSE IT'S GOOD

02:50:35.792 --> 02:50:37.660
YEARS. WHERE THERE IS

02:50:37.727 --> 02:50:38.962
SUFFICIENT WATER TO GET

02:50:39.028 --> 02:50:41.898
JUVENILES OUT TO SEA AND

02:50:41.965 --> 02:50:43.633
SURVIVE IN HIGH NUMBERS TO THEN.

02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:45.568
COME BACK IN AND CONTINUE TO

02:50:45.635 --> 02:50:48.504
SUPPORT THE POPULATION. BIGELOW

02:50:48.571 --> 02:50:49.105
THERE COULD BE MANY WAYS TO DO

02:50:49.172 --> 02:50:51.774
THAT. ONE WAY IS ENSURING IT

02:50:51.841 --> 02:50:55.244
DOES FISH OUT SUFFICIENT FLOW.

02:50:55.311 --> 02:50:57.947
MANAGED WAY ACROSS THE VALLEY

02:50:58.014 --> 02:50:59.482
TO GET OUT AND THAT COULD BE

02:50:59.549 --> 02:51:01.551
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS

02:51:01.618 --> 02:51:02.151
COORDINATING RELEASES FROM THE

02:51:02.218 --> 02:51:04.754
DANCE. THE OTHER THING I NEED

02:51:04.821 --> 02:51:07.156
IS FOOD. WE'RE LARGELY CUT OFF

02:51:07.223 --> 02:51:08.825

02:51:11.127 --> 02:51:11.628

HISTORICALLY REAR GROW PUT ON

02:51:14.297 --> 02:51:15.531

MIGRATING TO THE OCEAN. AND

02:51:17.667 --> 02:51:19.669
IT'S KEY TO THEIR SURVIVAL. NOW

02:51:19.736 --> 02:51:20.603
OUR LANDSCAPE IS LARGELY

02:51:20.670 --> 02:51:22.138
DOMINATED BY AGRICULTURE AND

02:51:22.205 --> 02:51:23.172
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE FEW AND

02:51:23.239 --> 02:51:24.607
FAR BETWEEN WE NEED TO TRY TO

02:51:24.674 --> 02:51:27.043

GIVE THEM FOODS THEY CAN GROW

02:51:35.785 --> 02:51:37.754
IT SURVIVED. TAKING ADVANTAGE

02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:38.955
OF THOSE HIGH WATER YEARS

02:51:39.022 --> 02:51:40.990
WHETHER SURVIVAL CAN. REALLY BE

02:51:41.057 --> 02:51:42.892
