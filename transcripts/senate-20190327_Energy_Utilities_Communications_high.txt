WE NEED ABOUT A HUNDRED MEMBERS TO GET A QUORUM SO. THEY'RE NOT HERE YET -- BUT WE'RE GONNA START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY TO LISTEN COMMUNICATIONS GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY. WE'LL START WITH -- HERTZBERG IS OUR FIRST FIRST AUTHOR BUT HE'S NOT HERE. I WILL START WITH. CENTER DOT ARE YOU READY. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SB ONE SIXTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF HOW UTILITIES ASSIST CUSTOMERS PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS -- OBVIOUSLY RELY ON LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT WITH THE UTILITY DE ENERGIZES POWER LINES TO PROTECT AGAINST WILDFIRE DISHES. LAST YEAR'S SB NINE A ONE RECORD. ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO PREPARE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT INCLUDE PROTOCOLS FOR DE ENERGIZING POWER LINE. IT IS LIKELY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FORMAL PROTOCOLS TO DE ENERGIZED POWER LINES. THE FREQUENCY OF POWER OUTAGES WILL GROW. THE INTERNALIZATION OF ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT. OF ITS OWN. AMONG THOSE RACES THE INTERRUPTION OF POWER NEEDED TO OPERATE CUSTOMER BASE LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. CALIFORNIA'S THREE LARGEST THE LARGEST INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SERVE IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CRITICAL CARE MEDICAL BASE LIKE. WHO RELY ON LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT? MANY OF THESE CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMERS ARE LOW INCOME IT ALREADY RECEIVE DISCOUNTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE. RATE. ENERGY I'D CALL PRAYER PROGRAM. I BELIEVE IT'S A MATTER OF HEALTH AND SAFETY TO ASSIST LOW INCOME CRITICAL CARE MEDICAL BASS LINE CUSTOMERS IN THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY BACKUP POWER. THEY CAN OPERATE LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT FOR THE DURATION OF A POWER OUTAGE. SB ONE SIXTY SEVEN SIMPLY REQUIRES ELECTRIC UTILITY TO DETERMINE HOW IT WANTS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND DESCRIBE IT. IT'S SOLUTION IN THAT PART OF THE WILD. THAT PERTAINS TO DE ENERGIZED DEAR IS ASIAN PROTOCOLS. NOTHING IN THIS BILL TELLS UTILITY HOW TO DO THIS JUST THAT THEY NEED TO DO THIS. I'M AWARE OF THE CLEVER CASE SINCE CLARIFICATION SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS AND I'M HAPPY. TO ACCEPT THEM AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF WRITER -- HER GOOD WORK SO A THERE'S NO OPPOSITION THIS BILL EVERY RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR HERE SO SO I JUST RECEIVED SOME [inaudible] SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. TO THE AMENDMENTS THE AMENDMENTS THAT. HAVE YOU SEEN. HAVE YOU SEEN. THESE MEN WILL ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AND KATE AND THE AMENDMENTS. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE THEY HAVE BEEN WE'VE TESSA. YOU HAVE THE OF THE AMENDMENTS. YOU HAVE THE AMENDMENTS AS ONE MAKE SURE WITHOUT THOSE MATTERS. WE HAVE A FORUM IF WE COULD -- CALL THE ROLL PLEASE HUESO. WITH HIM A LOT. MORE LIKE CARE BRADFORD HERE CAME [inaudible] DODD [inaudible] HERTZBERG HERE. HILL HERE MCGUIRE RUBIO. RUBIO HERE INNER STERN DOWN. DOWN HERE WINNER. OKAY SO ARE YOUR ACCEPTED IN THE GIVEN THE FREQUENCY AND DESTRUCTIVENESS OF THOSE WILD CARDS WERE STRONG WAS PART OF ABOUT HER. OF EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES AND MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT. IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR MANY OF OUR MEMBER COUNTIES HAD THEIR POWER SHUT OFF PURSUANT TO A P. JEANNIE. THE ENERGY IS A SIN A VENT THAT EVENT WAS TO RESPOND. TO SEVERE WIND WARNINGS IN ALL P. GINNY SHUT OFF ABOUT FORTY ONE CIRCUITS. SERVING ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS SOME RESIDENTS WERE WITHOUT POWER FOR TOTAL OF THREE DAYS. BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PROBLEMS. FOR WATER WASTEWATER UTILITIES. BUT ALSO RESIDENTS RESIDENTS OFTEN COULDN'T FLUSH TOILETS TAKE SHOWERS OR PERFORM OTHER BASIC FUNCTIONS UNTIL POWER WAS RESTORED THREE DAYS LATER. THIS HAS SEVERE IMPACT ESPECIALLY ON LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN THOSE RELY ON LIFESAVING MEDICAL. SUPPORT. ONLY BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE POPULATIONS THAT CAN'T GO OUT AND AFFORD TO PURCHASE. A BACK UP GENERATOR. SO WE THINK THIS BILL MOVES THE DISCUSSION FORWARD MOVES -- DE INTERNALIZATION PROTOCOLS FORD SO THEY CONSIDER THE IMPACT ON THESE POPULATIONS WE UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO JUST MEDICALLY SOME TO THE POPULATIONS. AND HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT AND MITIGATE IMPACTS TO LOW INCOME POPULATIONS AS WELL. WITHOUT WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. MORNING RISK AND SALAS WITH NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL BENEFIT THE VULNERABLE PRESS AND THOSE WHO ARE LIVING IN POVERTY SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE.

THEY DOT -- THE NUMBER OF MINORITY -- CONSTITUENTS ON OUR OWN OXYGEN CONCENTRATORS THAT NEED TO BE RUN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. OTHERWISE YOU DON'T. AND AND DIE OF HYPOXIA SO -- YOU KNOW I THINK YOU YOU YOU YOU HAVE IN PLACE THE EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHT QUALITATIVE MANDATE ON THE UTILITIES YOU JUST SAID WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY.

TO ENERGY POLICY -- WE TALKED ABOUT IN THAT HEARING AND I KIND OF PREVIEW THIS BILL AT THE TIME. OF THE NOTION OF RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND IT WAS IT HAD ONE MEETING. TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN WE PASSAGE DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS TODAY IT HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MEANING. BECAUSE IT IS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE A HARD TIME DETERMINING. WHAT LOW THERE'S ACTUALLY GONNA SERVE ALL THESE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS THAT? ARE ULTIMATELY INTEGRATED INTO A LARGER PICTURE AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE ASKING HERE IS THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. START THIS PROCESS WHERE WE LOOK AT OPTIONS FOR SENT TO SOME LEVEL OF CENTRAL PROCUREMENT THIS TOGETHER WITH THE PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT MEASURE WHICH WILL HERE. IS AN EFFORT TO AT LEAST AS WE'VE MOVED ON WITH ALL THESE OTHER BILLS OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS.

THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE. WHAT WHEN WHEN I LEARNED THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY BY? TWENTY TWENTY THAT OF 240% OF EVERY SINGLE ALL IN AMERICA COMING THROUGH YOUR PHONE SERVICE. IS GOING TO BE A SPOOF CALLER THEY CALL THE ROBO CALL OF SORTS. I WAS REALLY SHOCKED. AND AND I THINK THERE. IS DEFINITELY A CONSIDER OUR THE CONCERN THAT WE SHOULD HAVE ABOUT. THIS. HI READING OF OUR TELEPHONE SYSTEM. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EMERGENCY RESPONSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. PEOPLE THAT HAVE -- NEED TO COMMUNICATE A HEALTH ISSUES AND AND AND OR FOR WHATEVER REASON AND PEOPLE ARE HAVE LESS CONFIDENCE IN THEIR TELEPHONE SERVICE TODAY THAN ANY OTHER TIME. IN OUR HISTORY. AND THAT GOES BACK TO WHEN. OUR SERVICE WAS VERY REMOTE. UP PEOPLE ARE ARE FED UP WOULD BE SPOOFING CALLS. AND WE WILL WE NEED TO DO SOME ABOUT IT CAN SOMETHING BE DONE YES. THIS BILL ARE SET THE DEADLINE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CALLER I. D. AUTHENTICATION AUTHENTICATION MEASURE. SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT. PATIENTS WOULD NEED TO BUY TECHNOLOGY THAT ALREADY EXISTED -- AUTHENTICATES. THE ORIGIN OF A CALL. SO THAT WE CAN BLOCK THESE WROBEL CALLS FROM THE SYSTEM -- THIS WOULD HANDLE THE MATURE. NOT ALL BUT THE MAJORITY OF OF THESE CALLS THAT. OUR OUR CLOGGING OUR PHONE LINES THE BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW THE CPC TO WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SUPPORT ACTION. AGAINST A LEGAL ROBO CALL.

ALL THIS LAW THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS LAWN THE WE IN. EFFECTUATE THIS SMALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AS I MENTIONED REBEL CULTURE THE NUMBER. ONE CONSUMER COMPLAINT IN THE NATION. THE TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. BROAD GENERATES THE GREATEST NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS TO THE COMMISSION. AND 70% OF THE SCAMS START OVER THE TELEPHONE. THIS IS BECOME A NINE HUNDRED MILLION [inaudible] DOLLAR INDUSTRY. THE SCAMMING PEOPLE FOR THEIR THEIR MONEY TO CALLS. OF THE THE THE NUMBER THERE ARE ARE OF SCAMS ARE TELEPHONES REPRESENTS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED MILLION I THINK ISSUE IS. TO BECOMES THAT GENERALLY. TEND TO BE PEOPLE. THAT ARE ARE. ARE VERY VULNERABLE. TO THESE VERY SOPHISTICATED SCAMS. AND THEY TEND TO BE PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD. TO GIVE UP GIVE UP THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY. THEY TEND TO BE THE ELDERLY THEY TEND TO BE. PEOPLE THAT ARE.

TWO ZERO EIGHT OUR IF WE COULD CLEAR THE SEATS FROM THE FRONT DESK. HEY HOW ARE YOU. GOOD MORNING I MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAROLINE MCINTYRE I'LL BE AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION. OF FIRST OF ALL WE AS AN INDUSTRY RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH ROBO CALLS IN SPIFFY. IN FACT -- IT IS THE INDUSTRY THAT IS ENGAGED IN LEADING AN EFFORT TO PERFECT THE COLOR -- AUTHENTICATION TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ENABLE US TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THESE CALLS DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE LEGITIMATE AND JUST TRY AND STOP THEM FROM GETTING THROUGH. AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE FCC AND THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL -- TO INSURE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THE ACTUAL PERPETRATORS OF THESE OFFENSES ARE IDENTIFIED IN ULTIMATELY WE WOULD HOPE PROSECUTED. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES HERE WITH THIS BILL TODAY FIRST OF ALL IS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT YET BEEN PERFECTED IN WHILE WE LOOK AND HOPE. TO HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE AND OPERATING AS IT SHED BY AT JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY WE DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE THE CASE AT SECONDLY THIS IS A NATIONAL ISSUE -- WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING THE SAME TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH BY THE WAY IS CALLED SHAKEN AND STAR -- BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT THE SAME TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AT THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND FORTY ADD THEIR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THE PROBLEM THEY DO HAVE A NATIONAL TASK FORCE. IN WHICH CALIFORNIA IS VERY MUCH ENGAGED AND WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY TO TRY AND SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. TODAY WE HAVE THIS BILL BEFORE US THAT BRINGS IN ANOTHER REGULATORY AGENCY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHO HAS NOT NO EXPERTISE AT ALL IN THIS AREA AND WILL PROVIDE. NO VALUE TO ADDING THAT AS AN ADDITIONAL AGENCY TO THE AUTHORITY THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ALREADY HAS SECONDLY -- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT LIABILITY ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'VE NOT YET HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERFECT THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE SOME. AND WE BLOCK THAT CALL. CARRIER MAY BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND I OFFER YOU THE EXAMPLE OF WHEN THERE ARE EMERGENCIES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND THE SCHOOL MAY SEND OUT A BLAST CALL. TO THE PARENTS TO NOTIFY THEM OF THE EMERGENCY THAT NUMBER MAY NOT BE COMING FROM THAT CALL MAY NOT BE COMING FROM A NUMBER THAT IS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SCHOOL IF-WE BLOCK THAT CALL. AND THAT INFORMATION DOES NOT GET THROUGH TO THE PARENTS WE ULTIMATELY ARE GOING TO BE BLAMED FOR IT SO WE THAT'S FOR TWO MINUTES TODAY ONE WOULD BE TO ELIMINATE THE INCLUSION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND THE SECOND WOULD BE TO CONSIDER PROVIDING SOME SORT OF LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR THE CARRIERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD PRO ACTIVELY TO IMPLEMENT THIS TECHNOLOGY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE CARD. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON -- CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR AFFAIRS COUNCIL FOR CTIA WERE THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY -- AS A IS MCINTYRE INDICATED -- THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY ALONG WITH THE CABLE INDUSTRY AND OTHER. TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS IS ACTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. IN CONCERT WITH THE FCC AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THIS IS A CUENTA CENTRAL FEDERAL ISSUE. WE'RE COMMITTED TO PROTECT BUT LET ME STIPULATE THAT NOBODY LIKES ILLEGAL ROBOCALLS THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T LIKE THEM DOESN'T HELP THEM -- CUSTOMER CERTAINLY DON'T. DON'T LIKE THEM. BUT IS ALSO MS MCINTYRE INDICATED THAT THE AUTOMATED CALLS LIKE PHARMACY REMINDERS TRAVEL UPDATES OR SCHOOL NOTICES DOCTORS MESSAGES. CAN BE USEFUL. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT ALTHOUGH THE BILL -- IS -- SUGGESTED TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS WE DO WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS THAT'S ALREADY ON GOING. AND AS MS MCINTYRE INDICATED BY ADDING ANOTHER REGULATORY LEVEL -- BY A A NON EXPERT REGULATORY AGENCY IN THE STATE -- WE MAY VERY WELL SLOW THINGS DOWN AND TAKE OUR EYE OFF THE BALL. THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS ALREADY WORKING WITH THE FCC WIRELESS CUSTOMERS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO CURB ON MY DIPLOMA CALLS WITH BLOCKING FEATURES AND TOOLS THAT CAN IDENTIFY LIKELY SPENT. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH STANDARDS BODIES LIKE THE ALLIANCE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS AS TO IMPLEMENT THE CALLER ID UP BY THE CAGE THIRTY CASING CALLED SHAPE AND STIR AS WE INDICATED -- THE FOR NATIONAL WIRES CARRIES OR INTRACTABLE MEANT SHAKEN STIR VERY QUICKLY HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR BUT AS AS MS MCINTYRE INDICATED -- BUT THERE ARE OTHER -- PLAYERS INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS SO WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY ON OUR OWN IN DOING THIS BUT I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH. THAT THE THAT THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY SO COMMITMENT TO THIS. SB TO AWAIT WOULD CREATE A A PATCHWORK OF STATE LAWS AND pAS I INDICATED A FEDERAL ISSUE. WE SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANT TASK AT HAND IMPLEMENTING STIR SHAKE IT NEITHER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION NOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS EQUIPPED TO ENFORCE LAWS DEALING WITH ROBO CALLS. WILL NOT HASTEN THE PROCESS. OF IMPLEMENTING APPROPRIATE NECESSARY AUTHENTICATION. IT WILL ONLY DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THAT TASK AND ADD A LAYER OF REGULATION THAT IS OFTEN UP TO SEND WAS PROCESS THESE ARE LIKE THE AND CERTAINLY IN THIS CASE UNNECESSARY AND FOR THAT REASON RESPECTFULLY. WE LIST OF CLOSE TO FIFTY TWO AWAY. THE COMMITTEE CARLSON MISTER MIND. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE EFFORTS. FIVE I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS TO MAKE FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE CHAIRMAN FOR SHOWING LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE WHILE WE DISAGREE WITH THE SOLUTION THIS PRESENTED IN THI PARTICULAR BILL HE'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. THIS IS A NATIONAL MENACE THESE ILLEGAL ROBOCALLS AND TRUST ME IF I TELL YOU THAT IF WE COULD HAVE THIS FIXED TODAY WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY FIX THIS PROBLEM. WE CHAIRED THE FIRST TASK FORCE HONORABLE CALL STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THAT'S HOW LONG THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN WORKING TOGETHER. TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY LET ME EMPHASIZE IT'S ILLEGAL ACTIVITY NOT BY THE CARRIERS. BUT BY OUTSIDE SOURCES. I SPECIALLY INTERNATIONAL SOURCES THAT ARE OFF SHORE. SECONDLY I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT WITH REGARD TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT DENNIS MCINTYRE OFFER WE TWO WOULD ENDORSE THOSE AMENDMENTS AND ASKS FOR THE CHAIRMAN'S CONSIDERATION -- ON THOSE PARTICULAR AMENDMENTS AND THEN FINALLY WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH THE CHAIRMAN AND HIS STAFF BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER MECHANISMS THAT WE CAN EPLOY NOW. AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- WITH FINDING TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AS SOON AS WE ARE CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING IN FACT WE EXPECT SHAKEN STIR SOME CARRIERS WILL BE INTRODUCING THAT TECHNOLOGY AS EARLY AS MAY OR JUNE OF THIS YEAR -- BUT THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS OTHERS OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THERE IS APPLICATIONS AND SOFTWARE AVAILABLE ON BOTH WIRELESS AND WIRELINE NETWORKS. THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON PROMOTING AND HELPING EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TODAY. AND TOOLS AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE SO -- WOULD LIKE TO BE AS POSITIVELY AS WE CAN BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A CONSENSUS. THAT THIS IS A MAJOR MAJOR PROBLEM SO MISTER CHAIRMAN LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU AND IN SPITE OF THAT WE DO OPPOSE THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF THEM ALL THANK YOU. MISTER VINE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AM LIMITS ON BEHALF OF CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS AND ECHO THAT TESTIMONY OF AT THE OPPONENTS BEFORE AS WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT NOT ALL. COMPANIES ARE LARGE COMPANIES THAT ARE READY TO DEPLOY THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS AS ACROSS MULTIPLE STATES. BUT REALLY SMALL SERVICE TERRITORIES IN EACH STATE IN A LOT OF THEM ARE. CLASSIC LAND LINE TELEPHONE COMPANIES AND RURAL AREAS -- SO THEY DON'T HAVE OF VOICE TECHNOLOGY TO THE CUSTOMER. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT -- A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH -- THAT VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE -- BUT MOST OF ALL SINCE WE'RE PRETTY MUCH A SMALL COMPANY ACROSS MULTIPLE STATES A NATIONAL APPROACH -- WOULD BE MUCH EASIER FOR THE A COMPANY LIKE CONSOLIDATED TO IMPLEMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS LEWIS. YES MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DOMINIC TOMORROW HERE ON BEHALF OF FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS FOR ALL THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WE ALSO OPPOSE [inaudible] YOUR TOMORROW. HOW DO ARE SILLY ON BEHALF OF VERIZON WHILE WE DO VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE BILL FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED WE MUST UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSE TODAY AND LIKE ALL TO REQUEST CONSIDERATION OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE SET FORWARD EARLIER THANK YOU. DAVID KRIEGER ON BEHALF OF SPRING ALSO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY THER. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY. QUESTIONS FOR MY COLLEAGUES SENATOR BRADFORD. I JUST LAST QUESTION AS WE ALL KNOW. DEALING WITH THIS COMMITTEE -- THE CHALLENGES DO YOU SEE AS AND OVERSEEING THOSE THINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN YOUR WILL HOUSE ARE THERE THE ARE THEY THE BEST AGENCY. TO HELP IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM IT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE. IMPLEMENTED BUT I THINK. WE KNOW THE CHALLENGE YOU TO BE YOU SEE IT MIGHT SLOW UP WITH TO TRY TO DO. AND INITIALLY WE WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT AND WE WE NEED TO PUT SOME KIND OF ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IN THIS BILL NOT WE'RE STARTING WITH BUT WERE. WERE. GOING TO THIS PROCESS I'M SURE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO REVISIT THAT BUT IN THE MEANTIME. ARE THERE REALLY IS NO OTHER. AGENCY IN THE STATE THAT COULD. OF COURSE THIS BILL [inaudible] CENTER DODD. WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECTIVE DATE I DIDN'T GET THAT IN THIS OF JULY FIRST? TWENTY TWENTY AND IF YOU -- IT WOULD WHEN WE HEARD THE TESTIMONY ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE BECOMING OUT THAT YEAR I GUESS IS WHAT WE JUST HEARD WITH THE TESTIMONY AND YOU PROBABLY HEARD THROUGH THE TESTIMONY THAT THERE'S TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE. AND WE LOOKED AT NOT ONLY THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ALSO THE FACT THAT THE THEIR COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA CANADA THAT BY THE END OF THIS MONTH WILL HAVE THIS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED IN THE COUNTRY. IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING -- THERE THE RATED DO IT NOW -- WE'RE WE'RE BASICALLY LOOKING. BEYOND A YEAR [inaudible] AND I THINK THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME. BUT IT IT'S IT'S IT'S A BIG PROBLEM TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE I THINK WITHOUT A A VERY -- SOLID POLICY ON THAT MATTER IT WILL NOT HAPPEN ON ITS OWN. SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU WELL FIRST OF ALL AND THANK GOD THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS UP IT IS A CONCERN -- AND I CAN JUST SHARE JUST BASED ON THE FACT THAT TAXES ARE DUE TO YOU KNOW RECENTLY OF RECEIVE A COUPLE A CALL SAYING THAT I LAID IN MY MIKE. COPY MY FIRST THREE DIGITS OF MY PHONE NUMBER BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S WITHIN MY AREA AND I WILL PICK UP. BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS IN TERMS OF THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN I AM YOU KNOW. WAS A SCHOOL TEACHER IS SEVENTEEN YEARS AND AND THERE IS OPERABLE BECAUSE THAT WE CONSTANTLY SEND DOWN IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW GET A COMMUNITY EVENTS FUNDRAISERS AND IN PARTICULAR A FEW TIMES WE HAD TO CLOSE THE SCHOOL BECAUSE OF WEATHER CONDITIONS AND WE GOT A CALL EARLY IN. THE MORNING NOT TO ATTEND AND SO I DO HAVE CONCERNS AND NOW ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO TO SIT DOWN WITH ALL THE FOLKS WHO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE SAFETY OF OUR SCHOOLS NUMBER ONE BUT ALSO NUMBER -- TWO I WOULD ALSO ASK CONSIDER EXTENDING THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS I KNOW CANADA'S DOING IT RIGHT NOW BUT YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM SMALLER COMPANIES HERE THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO IT AS FAST SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO REALLY SIT DOWN WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN. AND LET'S DISCUSS SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT THEY EXPRESSED THANK YOU. YOUR ANY OTHER OF MY COLLEAGUES. CENTER HUESO -- THE COMMENT WAS MADE THAT. FORTY ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AROUND THE COUNTRY -- A FORMER CAST PORTION ARE WORKING ON THIS STEPHANIE. PFIZER COMMENTS ON THAT WELL -- COURAGE BY IT. BUT IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME AT THE FEDERAL -- I AGREE THIS IS A FEDERAL ISSUE. IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE STATE FROM DOING THIS WE'VE WE'VE ENGAGED IN MANY THINGS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD SHOULD DO AN HASN'T SUCCESSFULLY. AND AS MANY PEOPLE. HAVE REPEATEDLY SAID IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT WERE CALIFORNIA GOES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY FOLLOWS I THINK. THIS BILL WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT BILL TO TO PASS HERE LOCALLY TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THE SAME THING NATION WIDE. WE COULD SHOW THAT LEADERSHIP HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ONLY MADE COMMENTS TO THE INDUSTRY SAYING YOU GUYS BETTER FIX THIS OR WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME. LIKE IT'S IT'S PROVIDING ANY REAL DIRECTION OR CERTAINTY -- IN IN IN ESTABLISHING. A IT'S MORE OF A THREAT THAN A REAL ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND AND I DON'T THINK THINKS EFFECTS OUT WAY. AND THEN THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT LIABILITY EXPOSURE SAY A REVERSE NINE ONE ONE IS BLOCKED. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE STATE GOING TO DO THAT? ADDRESS THAT CONCERN. WELL YOU KNOW -- AGAIN AS WE GO THROUGH THIS THIS BILL IS IN A BILL THAT'S INTENDED TO STOP ALL ROBO CALLS TO TO ATTEND TENDED TO STOP THE MAJORITY OF ON BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THE THE MANNER OF THE OF THE PROBLEM IS VERY COMPLEX AND AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THOSE THAT ARE GENERATED BY A COMPUTER PROGRAM. THAT MIMICS ANOTHER TELEPHONE CALL AND THAT WOULD PRETTY MUCH HANDLE LIKE 80% OR 78% OF ALL THE CALLS ARE IN THE IN THE SYSTEM. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LIABILITIES WELL? WE UNDERSTAND THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ARE NOT THE ORIGIN OF THESE CALLS AND WE DON'T WANT TO TREAT THEM. LIKE LIKE -- CRIMINALS AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS LAW DOES IT DOESN'T -- IT IT SIMPLY SAYS ACTIVATE VOICE. AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM. AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THEN THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES AND UNDERTHIS BILL SO. WHY WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT THEM A PROVIDE THEM LIABILITY FROM FROM COMPLYING WITH THE LAW I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT? IF YOU LOOK AT HOW -- HOLES ARE ARE ARE -- UP UP UP. YOU MENTIONED OF CALL BLOCKING FOR EXAMPLE -- IS IS REGULATED BY THE FCC ALREADY THERE PLENTY OF LAWS THAT ALREADY. AND REGULATE THEM A IN IN THAT AREA SO -- WHAT WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT -- LIABILITY PROTECTION OR A SAFE HARBOR IN THIS AREA IT REALLY IS UNNECESSARY IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR THIS BILL. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO TO THEM AND AND WE JUST. DISAGREE THAT THOSE ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A SAFE HARBOR FROM A LAW. THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING IT'S JUST BASICALLY -- ON OFFRAMP TO COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW AND AND I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT SO. THEY HAVE NOT THEY'RE THEY'RE PROPOSING SOME SOME AMENDMENTS THEY HAVE NOT PROVIDED ANY LANGUAGE. I'M I'M OPEN TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM AS I'VE I'M OPEN WITH EVERY -- CONSTITUENT THAT WE HAVE -- ON EVERY BILL THAT WE RUN WE ALWAYS SIT DOWN OUR DOORS ALWAYS OPEN NOBODY WILL EVER SAY THAT COULD NOT GAIN ACCESS TO IT TO ME OR MY OFFICE ON A BILL THAT AFFECTS THEM. I DO NOT WANT TO PASS A BILL THAT IMPACTS OF NEGATIVELY. IN A WAY THAT'S UNFAIR. BUT CAN WE IMPLEMENT THIS BILL YES WE ARE USING MODELS OF OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE SUCCESSFULLY -- A DOING THIS I THINK WE CAN DO IT I THINK IT'S WITHIN OUR POWER I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING EXTRAORDINARY UNDER OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IN OUR LAWS ARE PREVENT US FROM DOING THIS. CENTER STERN DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION YEAH. JUST VERY BRIEFLY -- BUILDING OFF THAT THAT QUESTION THOUGH -- THE THE LIABILITY HERE IS ABOUT THE PRO THE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE PLANS CORRECT LIKE IF IT THEY DON'T PUT A POINT IT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF THE PLAN ITSELF IN TERMS OF THEM THESE PLANS BEING. GOING TO IF FIXING EVERYTHING IS THAT THEY'VE GOT TO PUT SOMETHING FOR THAT'S THAT'S THE IN. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL. THAT'S THE HOOK HERE YOU MIGHT DO THAT IT'S VERY SIMPLE I MEAN THE THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS. WE KNOW WHAT THE A TECHNOLOGY DOES. AS LONG AS THEY PROVIDE A TECHNOLOGY THAT EFFECTIVELY DOES WHAT WERE WERE ASKING THEM TO DO THE AUTHENTICATOR CALL. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE IT'S IT'S THAT SIMPLE EMPLOY THAT TECHNOLOGY PUT IT INTO A FACT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXTENDING TIME WE TALK ABOUT ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS THIS IS NOT ONEROUS IT DOESN'T IT IT'S NOT A COMPLICATED THING THAT. WE CAN ONLY. ARE ASKED THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO EMPLOY TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY THIS IS NOT SOME SCI FI -- YOU KNOW A FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY THE STILL HASN'T BEEN DEVELOPED. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE SIMPLICITY OF THIS BILL WE'RE WE'RE ASKING THEM DEPLOYED THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TODAY CAN THOSE TECHNOLOGIES BE IMPROVED IN THE FUTURE YES AND IF IS AS OUR IMPROVED. I THINK THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOME SOME LEVEL OF AN AGENCY TO SAY YOU KNOW WORK YOU'RE NOT EMPLOYED. THE THE THE BEST AND THE MOST. EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES OF OUR TIMEYOU'RE STILL IN. IN A FEW DECADES BEHIND THAT WE NEED SOMEBODY. TO THIS IS GONNA BE A PROBLEM THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE IN FUTURE YEARS AS PEOPLE. YOU KNOW VOTE. I REMEMBER WHEN THEY CAME UP WITH THE VIRUS VIRUS ANTI VIRUS SOFTWARE. WE WE THOUGHT VIRUSES WERE WERE SOLVE WE'RE STILL. THAT'S JUST IN OF ALL THE IN -- INDUSTRY INVOLVED IN HUMAN PRACTICE. THAT NEEDS AN EVOLUTION OF OF A OF A COUNTER -- THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE SIMILAR HERE BUT WE NEED TO CREATE THAT STRUCTURE AND THE MECHANISM TO ENSURE. THAT AT LEAST WERE FIGHTING BACK SO EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT THE FIRST CUT THIS BILL WOULDN'T NECESSARILY. ENHANCE LIABILITY JUST BECAUSE THAT PLANS NOT PERFECT ENOUGH FIXING THE WHOLE PROBLEM THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING YOU CITY MUCH ON AND THAT'S YOU GOT TAKE A SHOT AT IT PUT SOMETHING FORWARD. AND THEN LET THIS EVOLVE OVER TIME BECAUSE I I MEAN THE THING THAT SCARES ME IS LESS I THINK THE TELCOS. RIGHT IN CABLE AND EVERYBODY'S THEY HATE THIS PROBABLY AS MUCH AS WE DO BECAUSE IT MAKES US HATE OUR PHONES AND HOW HE NOW AND WE WE BLAME THEM -- BUT THE THE THE PART THAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST IS THE A. I.. AND THAT YOU KNOW THE ROBOTS OUT THERE WITHOUT ANY. I DON'T I KNOW THAT'S BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAYBE STAFF HAS SOME IDEA BUT LIKE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE. EMPLOYING THIS A AYE TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY GENERATE THESE NUMBERS AND STARTED [inaudible] WE A MIGHT BE ON THIS GO BUT HOW DO WE GO AFTER THE THE ROBOTS IN THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DEPLOYING THE ROBOTS THAT ARE. MAKING THIS POLLUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S INTERESTING THAT RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE MARKETING ROBOCOP TECHNOLOGIES RIGHT. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT THEY'RE ACTUALLY SAYING HEY -- THIS TO YOU YOU COULD MAKE. MILLIONS OF CALLS THROUGH THIS APP FOR FREE. WERE USED TO BE A COSTLY PROGRAM NOW IT'S FREE. OR OR NEAR FREE. AND THEIR MARKETING AT I MEAN THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOME ELEMENT OF OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE THIS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE -- JOHN OLIVER DID THIS AMAZING PIECE. ON ON ON HIS SHOW ABOUT ROBO CALLS AND HE ACTUALLY GOT ON THE SHOW AND STARTED A ROBO CALL TO ALL TE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS THAT HAVE REFUSED TO ACT ON THIS. BUT HE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT. I WANT YOU TO MAKE THIS MY ABILITY TO MAKE THIS RUBBLE CALL ILLEGAL BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S LEGAL AND HE DID ON TV AND THAT KIND OF JUST. TALKS ABOUT. HOW HOW? ABSURD -- THE WAY WE'RE TREATING THIS IS INITIALLY IN THIS COUNTRY WE'RE NOT DOING. WHEN YOU SAY ARE WE DOING SOMETHING WELL? I MEAN WHEN WOULD SOMEBODY CAN GET ON TV AND SAY I CAN DO THIS -- WILLFULLY AND AND THERE'S THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES WELL THAT JUST BASICALLY EXPLAINS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN OUR COUNTRY. THANKS. THANK YOU SENATOR. SENATOR DODD PLEASE. SENATOR I I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS. I THINK I DIALED THE SAID I'M TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I'VE JUST UNCLEAR. IF THE TECHNOLOGY. BY THE EFFECTIVE DATE. OF THIS BILL -- CANNOT ASCERTAIN THE POSITIVE FROM THE NEGATIVE. TYPE OF ROBO CALLS. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY OUT THERE THAT CAN SUIT ANY TIME ANY PLACE. YEAH OF GIVEN THE TOURNEY EGO SU AND SO. MY CONCERN FROM FROM WHAT I HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONY IS. AND THAT THAT THAT THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU'LL WORK WITH THE YEAH THE OPPOSITION ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CREATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. TRY TO DO THE BEST THING THAT WE CAN FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. YOU YOUR YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN WITHOUT THIS LAW ANYBODY COULD FILE A LAWSUIT TO THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CURRENTLY FOR FOR THE RUBLE COLLEGE ANYBODY. THIS BILL THAT WON'T CHANGE THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO -- THE FACT THAT THIS BILL PASSED DOESN'T CHANGE. THAT'S IN OUR YOUR DISSIDENT PANTS AT ALL. I I GET THAT BUT IT'S IT'S SO IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A LAWSUIT ON I I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THESE. ROBO CALLS AND THE DEFENSE IS WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE FENCES. BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING THAT MIGHT GET THE ATTENTION OF A JUDGE OR YES SOMEBODY WERE. YOU KNOW WE HAD. A YELLOW PARENTS AT THE SCHOOL. THE THEY DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE AND WE WERE DAMAGE BECAUSE X. Y. AND SEE AND SO THAT PROBABLY RISES TO A HIGHER LEVEL ON ABOUT EDGES. RADAR THEN THAT WOULD BE A LOSS IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONCENTRATED ON WHETHER THE TELECOMMUNICATION HAS EFFECTUATE OR EMPLOYED OR PUT INTO PRACTICE OF CALL AYE AUTHENTICATION PROGRAM. SO THAT WOULD BE. THE THAT WHAT THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD GIVE SOMEBODY. REASON TO LAWSUIT UNDER THIS BILL. OKAY YOU SAID YOU WOULD. BE DISCUSSING THIS WITH MY HOPE YOU'LL ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU CENTER GOD DOES CENTER HUESO WE TRY. TO MAKE SURE QUESTIONS. CREATED HAVE TIME FOR SENATOR HERTZBERG TO ARRIVE. SO HE'S HERE. WE WANT TO ALLOW HIM TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS [inaudible] BIPARTISAN CONSPIRACY -- I'M TELLING YOU IT SENATOR I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE THIS DRIVES ME CRAZY. I'LL GET TWENTY THIRTY CALLS A DAY YOU GET THE CALLS THAT SAY THIS IS THE IRS WE'RE GOING TO SEND THE COPS AFTER YET. AND EVEN IF IT'S ONE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT RESPONSE IT'S BAD NEWS. RIGHT. I WOULD HAVE A SPECIAL. PENAL CODE FOR PEOPLE THAT VIOLATE THIS LAW. IT DOES REALLY BAD THINGS TO THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FOLKS. THE QUESTION I AM FOCUSED WITH BECAUSE I WANT TO DO THE SAME BILLING YOU BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH. BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE CALLS ARE GENERATED AROUND THE WORLD THROUGH THESE AND THEY GOT THESE RANDOM DEALS AND THEY CUT AND TRY TO GET NUMBERS TO MIMIC NUMBERS THAT YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE. AND THEN NOT REAL PHONE NUMBERS RIGHT I DON'T THESE SYSTEMS ARE YOU THAT YOU REFERENCE TO YOUR KIND OF FANCY STUFF FROM FOR MY SIMPLE WIND BUT I'D LIKE TO GET SOME EXPLANATION ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE TEST RIGHT. I HAD THIS FOR EXAMPLE WITH WITH THE HACKING WILL BE CALL IT WOULD PEOPLE WANT RANSOMWARE YET EVEN THEN IT WAS LIKE YEAH WE ENHANCE THE STUFF BUT HAD WITH THE STUFF COMING FROM BULGARIA IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. WHERE PEOPLE ARE MAKING THE MONEY I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW OLD YOU WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES WITH YOUR PHILOSOPHY AND YOUR YOUR OBJECTIVE? WHEN I TRY TO GRAPPLE WITH IS HOW TO GET THERE RIGHT WE CAN TELL THESE THESE COMPANIES TO DO ALL THIS STUFF? BUT THE TECHNOLOGY SO GOOD TODAY AND THE STUFF SONY SO PHONY BALONEY. HOW DO WE ACTUALLY CATCH THESE FOLKS RIGHT WE HAVE THE JURISDICTIONAL PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST AMER COMING OUTSIDE JURISDICTION FINE THE STEP IN THE CALIFORNIA YET YOU KNOW SLICE OFF A BLADE OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW I'M KIND OF TOUGH ON THESE THINGS I'M JUST SO UPSET ABOUT IT? AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT YOU HEAR ABOUT ALL THE TIME THE COMMUNITY BUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL STANDPOINT. MAKE THIS EFFECTIVE USE WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THAT WE COME OUT WE GOT THIS FANCY TITLE WE SAY WE'RE FIXING IT BUT IT DOESN'T IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES HOW IS SENATOR HUESO CAN IMPACT. THE FOLKS IN MY COMMUNITY THAT ARE PISSED OFF SO I SAY SAID ALWAYS WAS FIXING THIS. AGAIN -- THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD BE EMPLOYED AS A VOICE OF THE A CALLER AUTHENTICATION SO EVEN ACTION -- IF I CAN DESCRIBE IT IN A WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE. COULD UNDERSTAND IS THAT -- WHEN WHENEVER YOU GO INTO A COMPUTER? AND THEY THEY HAVE THEY ASK YOU TO TRANSLATE A WORD. THAT HAS BEEN THAT IT'S KIND OF A SQUIGGLY WORD AND IT'S NOT SEEN IT YEAH YEAH AND THEY SAY WHAT IS TO SAY AND THEN TO YOU ENTER WHAT YOU READ RIGHT NORMALLY THAT'S A WAY AROUND A COMPUTER THAT CAN. THAT CAN ã RESPOND OR FILL IN THE BLANK. BUT A COMPUTER CAN'T REALLY -- I IDENTIFY. CURSIVE RIGHT UP LET IS NOT EVEN CURSIVE IT'S KIND OF IN A IN A IN AN AUDITORY SKATED AWAY THAT THAT YOUR I CAN PICK IT UP AT THE COMPUTER HERE I CAN PICK IT UP AND YOU CAN KINDA LOOK AND SO THAT KINDA LOOKS LIKE TO BE A KIND. OF THE FACT HE LOOKS KINDA LOOKS LIKE AN NINE I'M. AND THEN YOU ENTER THAT WHAT IS BE AND STILL [inaudible] AND SO [inaudible] GREAT RIDES. IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT. OUR SENATOR ALAN SO IT IN A PLACE A SIMILAR TYPE OF APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING. A CALL WHEN IT'S COMING IN AND AND AND IF IF IT IT'S ACTUALLY COMING INTO Q. COMPUTER PROGRAM -- THERE'S LIKE AN ADDITIONAL STEP. FOLLOW TO ACTUALLY ENTER INTO THE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM IT'S A WHOLE SET OF IT'S A WHOLE PROGRAM. REGULATED ACTUALLY BY THE F. THE FCC. A PROGRAM CALLED CHICKEN AND STIRS IT'S NOT ACTUALLY SPELL CHECK AND STIRS BUT IT'S AN ACRONYM. THAT THAT. THAT IS A SHAKEN AND STIRRED JUST BASICALLY EMPLOYING SHAKEN AND STIRS MAKING IT UP. A CODED SAY. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO OF EMPLOYEE SHAKEN ANSWERS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA TO AUTHENTICATE CALLS. WHY DON'T WE DO THAT NOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT Y. FCC HASN'T MADE A REAL NATIONWIDE AS I MENTIONED CAñADA BY THE END OF THIS MONTH? WILL BE EMPLOYING -- THAT TECHNOLOGY TO TO CUT OUT ALL THOSE TROUBLE CALLS FROM THERE. TELEPHONE NETWORK I THINK WE CAN DO THIS. THEY CAN DO IT IN A MONTH I THINK WE CAN DO IT IN A YEAR AND A HALF AND AND IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE NOW AGAIN. THERE ARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT. I'M WE'RE DEALING MAINLY WITH THE THE ROBO CALLS THE COMPUTER GENERATED TO WHAT THE POTS THAT YOU THAT YOU ARE SO FAMILIAR WITH IN THE BILL THAT YOU RAN LAST YEAR YEAH. WE'RE WITH THAT'S WHAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON WITH THIS BILL THERE ARE OTHER ROBO CALLERS THAT ARE ACTUAL TELEMARKETERS THERE ARE. YOU KNOW. PROGRAMS THAT. THAT CAN BE TRACED. TO AN ORIGIN CALLER THAT. ARE NOT ILLEGAL BUT THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE A NUISANCE. BUT THE ONES THAT ARE USED. FOR CAMPAIGNS AND POLLS AND AND TELEMARKETERS. THOSE WILL NOT NOT THOSE WILL NOT BE AFFECTED. OF THESE ARE THE THE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE THEIR USER YOU ARE IT THESE ARE LARGE SCALE SCAMS. THAT SEND -- THOUSANDS OF CALLS IN ONE DIAL. CALL THIS NUMBER AND WHEN THEY DO CALL THERE WAITING WITH A VERY SOPHISTICATED SCAB. UNTENDED TO TO RIP THEM OFF BASICALLY. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE ASKING THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO PLACE TECHNOLOGY THIS TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE. THEY HATE THE REQUIREMENT I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT OTHER OUTSIDE OF THAT. AND THEN -- CHANG THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU -- I SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS AS TRYING. TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION AS TO WHAT FOLKS ARE THINKING AND FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL STANDPOINT I DO HAVE CONCERNS. ESPECIALLY WITH YOU FOR THE CITY OF THE OF THE TECH BECAUSE AS SENATOR OF STERN AND MENTIONED A AYE IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF A AYE AND HOW. HOW COMPLEX AND HOW -- EASY IT IS FOR THEM -- TO COPY THE SIGNATURE NOWADAYS I MEAN I'VE. EXPERIENCED BOSS AND WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT THE AUTHENTICATION THAT'S ACTUALLY CAPTURE -- BUT FROM THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF PERSPECTIVE I'M NOT SURE IF THE IF THE TECHNOLOGIES EVEN THERE. OF FOR THIS. LEGISLATION. TO TO BE EFFECTIVE. AND I'D LIKE TO TALK TO SOME MORE FOLKS ABOUT THIS. A PARTICULARLY IN THE INDUSTRY. BUT ON THE SET ON A SEPARATE POINT. BECAUSE THE AG ALREADY. HAS JURISDICTION OVER THIS I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY WE NEED -- THE CITY DOES NOT HAVE. TO THE FCC DID DIDN'T THEY GIVE AUTHORITY TO THE AG. NOT NOT ON THIS NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU. Q. CENTERING CENTER SKINNER I'M. I UNDERSTAND OR APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS THAT THEIR IN ANY TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS. ONLY BEGUN TO BE UTILIZED THE BLOCKING OF THESE -- THAT. THERE MIGHT BE SOME CALLS BLOCKS THAT. WERE INADVERTENT -- BUT I THINK IF. IF THE CONCERN THAT ENTITIES LIKE SCHOOLS AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT USE. DIFFERENT FORMS OF OF AUTOMATIC DIALING OR AUTOMATIC CALLING TO ALERT -- TO ALERT PEOPLE OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION HAD. REAL CONCERNS THAT. THE USE OF THIS OF THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEING. PROPOSED IN THIS BILL TO BLOCK THE ROBO CALLS. IF THAT WERE A CONCERN BY SAY EMERGENCY. ALERTS AND SUCH I THINK WE WOULD'VE HEARD FROM SUNNOW CLEARLY IT IS TRUE THAT NOT EVERYONE FOLLOWS EVERY BILL THAT WE DO. BUT THIS IS. THIS IS -- THERE'S ENOUGH ENTITIES THAT USE. THESE TYPE OF FOR LEGITIMATE PURPOSES THAT SOMEONE WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT AND IF THIS WERE REAL. REALLY SERIOUS CONCERN THAT WAS REALLY GOING TO INTERFERE WE WOULD HEAR FROM THEM WE ARENOT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OPPOSITION LIKE THAT BEFORE US RIGHT NOW. THE OPPOSITION THAT WE HAVE IS THE TELECOMMUTE TELECOMS AND I APPRECIATE THAT THEY WOULD ALWAYS PREFERRED TO HAVE. NATIONAL RULES THAT THEY ABIDE BY EVERYWHERE AND NOT -- YOU KNOW ARTS OUR STATE BY STATE APPROACH BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE YOU AND DAD. ANYWAY JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT THANK. ANYONE ELSE MY ALL RIGHT IN CENTER HUESO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST SIMPLY OF THIS IS A THIS IS A GROWING PROBLEM I I DON'T BELIEVE THIS WILL BE SOLVED WITHOUT. ANY KIND OF A REGULAR IN INTERVENTION I THINK THIS IS -- UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY WAY WE CAN FIX THIS. AND FOR ME THE MOST COMPELLING ARGUMENT AND ALL OF THIS WHETHER YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW THE THE COULD. WHETHER IT'S EMPLOYABLE OR NOT THE THE MOST COMPELLING ARGUMENT IS THAT IT. IT IS BEING DONE IT CAN BE DONE. CANADA IS GOING TO SHOW US THAT. IT WILL BE DONE. AT AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN USE AS A IF IF. YOU KNOW AS A MODEL. OF OF WHY A WHY WE CAN DO IT AND HOW WE CAN DO IT SO -- I'VE REALLY ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN THIS EFFORT. TO CLEAN UP.
