THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CURTIS NOTS IN A CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. FIRST ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD I WANT TO THANK. SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO COME AND SHARE SOME OF OUR WORK. I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH A QUICK HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE STATE WORKFORCE MORE -- NEAR MY TESTIMONY TO SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT'S OUR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR HERE IN CALIFORNIA. STATE WORKFORCE BOARD GETS ITS MANDATE FROM THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITIES ACT -- WHICH WE CALL WE WHICH A SIGN ALONG. TWENTY FOURTEEN WE'LL OUTLINES THE VISION AND STRUCTURE THROUGH ITS WORKFORCE TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED AND ADMINISTERED REGIONALLY AND LOCALLY. THE PRIMARY ROLE OF THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD IS TO CONVENE THE STATE'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS TO ENSURE A COMMON VISION SHARED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES UNDER WE OWE -- AND ALIGNED APPROACH TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA UNIFIED STRATEGIC WORKFORCE PLAN WHICH IS BUILT AROUND THREE POLICY OBJECTIVES THAT GUIDE STATE POLICY AND PRACTICE. ACROSS THE PARTNER PROGRAMS AND INFORM LOCAL POLICY AND SERVICE DELIVERY. THE FIRST IS FOSTERING THE MAN. GERMAN SKILLS ATTAINMENT SO THAT WORKFORCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS ONLINE TRAINING CONTENT WITH THE STATE'S INDUSTRY SECTOR NEEDS. SECOND ENABLING UPWARD MOBILITY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THOSE WITH BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. SO THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS THAT LEAD TO LONG TERM ECONOMIC SELF SUFFICIENCY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY. THIRD ALIGNING COORDINATING AND INTEGRATING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT'S ECONOMIZING LIMITED RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE SCALE AN IMPACT. SO WHAT WE DO IS ESTABLISH ACCESS TO THE BEST JOBS IN CALIFORNIA THE BUSINESS A WORKER PARTNERSHIPS THAT ADDRESS CURRENT AND FUTURE WORKFORCE CHANGING DEMANDS. THAT MOVE WORKERS AT AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO MOVE NEW PEOPLE IN. WE CALL THIS UP SKILL BACK FILL. USING OUR HIGH ROADS TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND HIGH ROADS CONSTRUCTION CREWS PROGRAMS WHICH WE JUST RECEIVED THIRTY MILLION. PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SOME G. G. R. F. FUNDS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WE ESTABLISH THESE PARTNERSHIPS IN INDUSTRIES ACROSS THE STATE. FOCUSED ON SECTORS AND REGIONS MOST IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND AUTOMATION. THAT'S THE DEMAND SIDE WE START WITH THE BEST JOBS IN INDUSTRY SECTORS THEY'RE DRIVING REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT WITH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS JOINTLY PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE. WE ARE WORKING TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT AND OUT COMES IN THE WORK FORCE SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY WE'RE SUPPORTING CBO THAT OUR MISSION DRIVEN. THAT KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES THAT BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. SAID THOSE CBO'S ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE WORKFORCE SYSTEM. AB LEVEN ELEVEN IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS AUTHORED BY THE CHAIR THE BREAKING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE. IS FUNDED WITH FIFTEEN MILLION IN GENERAL FUND DOLLARS AND IS INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING WORK FORCE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. BY PROVIDING SERVICES TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF IN. OF INDIVIDUALS EITHER PREPARING TO ENTER ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN WORKFORCE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THESE SERVICES MUST BE DELIVERED THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN MISSION DRIVEN CBO'S WITH EXPERIENCE PROVIDING SERVICES TO TARGET POPULATIONS AND LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT MEETINGS WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH OF THIS YEAR. AND IN JUNE WE ESTABLISH A LETTER OF INTENT TO APPLY FOR GRANTS. TO ENGAGE THE FIELD AND GET A SCAN OF INTERESTED APPLICANTS -- THIS IS NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR THOSE WHO INTEND TO APPLY FOR THE GRANT. BUT IN OUR SCAN WE RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN LETTERS OF INTENT TO APPLY. FOR THESE GRANT FUNDS WITH NEARLY FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ASK. THE RFA FOR A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN IS SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED LATER THIS MONTH. SECOND OUR CORRECTIONS WORKFORCE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT WITH CDC ARE CAL P. I. A IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION. BUILT UPON THE FOUNDATION LAID BY OUR FORWARD FOCUS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY AB TWENTY SIXTY BY FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER DEMAND WHAT BETTER AS PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED THROUGH PROP THIRTY NINE IN HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS AND SOME OF OUR WORKFORCE ACCELERATOR GRANTS. FROM THIS PARTNERSHIP. INTENDED TO BRING CDC OUR TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS UNDER THE STATE WORKFORCE PLAN. THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT GRANT PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WHICH CONTAIN THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS TO ALIGN IN PRISON PROGRAMMING. WITH POST RELEASE SERVICES FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED AND JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS. WE ALL OF THE FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES US TO UPDATE OUR STATE WORKFORCE PLAN EVERY TWO YEARS. AND EARLIER THIS YEAR. WE SENT REGIONAL LOCAL PLANNING GUIDANCE. OUT THAT REQUIRED ALL FOURTEEN LABOR REGIONS TO DEVELOP PLANS ON ALIGNMENT AND LOCAL WORK FOR SERVICE DELIVERY FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS. WE SHOULD ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION IN PLANNING GRANTS FOR REGIONS TO CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS FROM WORK FORCE. PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDERS LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CBO'S TO DEVELOP THESE PLANS. WHICH THE STATE BOARD HAS RECEIVED AND ARE FINALIZING APPROVALS. THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD ALSO RELEASED AN RFA LAST FALL FOR THIRTY FOUR MILLION FOR REGIONAL DIRECTS IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES GRANTS. AND THOSE GRANTS ARE HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF APPROVAL IN FUNDING. THIRD IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR STATES CLIMATE GOALS WE NEED WORKERS TO DO IT. CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS ARE TRANSFORMING THE ECONOMY AND IN TRANSIT IN TRANSFORMING THE ECONOMY. WE NEED TO TRANSFORM THE WORK FORCE TO DO THIS WE NEED TO LOOK AT EQUITY. TO ACHIEVE EQUITY WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO JOB QUALITY A CLEAN GREEN ECONOMY THAT ALSO LIFTS ALL BOATS WON'T HAPPEN ACCIDENTALLY. AND WE WANT TO DO IT INTENTIONALLY. CALIFORNIA ALONE CAN'T SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WE ARE MODEL TO SHOW THE WAY. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GREAT MODELS. THAT COMPRISE THE CORE OF OUR EQUITY CLIMATE AND JOBS PROGRAM. THEY'RE NOT HUGE COMPARED TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. BUT WE FEEL THAT THEY SHOW US THE WAY. FIRST OUR HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS PROGRAM -- A LOT OF THIS WORK STARTED WITH OUR PROPOSITION THIRTY NINE FUNDING. AND IS INTENDED TO CREATE ACCESS TO STATE APPROVED CONSTRUCTION APPRENTICESHIPS THEIR MULTI CRAFT PRE APPRENTICESHIP PARTNERSHIPS. NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED -- BASED ON THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED MC OVER THE PAST FOUR FIVE YEARS WE'VE INVESTED IN BUILDING TWELVE PARTNERSHIPS -- THAT TOTAL ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS WITH LOCAL BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS JOINT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS CBO'S WORKFORCE BOARDS AND EDUCATION PARTNERS -- WE SERVED OVER -- TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS FROM DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS OF AVERAGE COME A COMPLETION RATE OF 80% -- SOME PROJECTS ARE OUR AVERAGE PLACEMENT RATE IS ABOUT 70% WITH ABOUT HALF OF THOSE -- PLACED AN ACTUAL APPRENTICESHIPS THE OTHER HALF ARE ENROLLED IN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION OR IN CONSTRUCTION RELATED JOBS -- WE WILL EXPAND THIS WORK -- WITH OUR SB ONE FUNDS -- WHICH THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD HANDS HAS WHICH INCLUDES. A TWENTY FIVE MILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS -- TO EXPAND THESE HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREER -- MODELS. THE SCALE OF EXISTING PROJECTS AND TRANSFER THESE MODELS THAT WE PILOTED IN PARTS OF THE STATE -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING THE OTHER -- SECTORS IDENTIFIED IN THE SCOPING PLAN [inaudible] SO -- IN ADDITION TO THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN SB ONE DOLLARS WE ALSO. HAVE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN G. G. R. F.

EIGHT TO TWENTY PROJECTS. IN SECTORS IDENTIFIED -- IN THE SCOPING PLAN -- AND OUR OUR PLAN THERE IS A SERVE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND DISADVANTAGED WORKERS -- SERVE TO THESE TWENTY H. R. T. PEAS -- INSISTING THAT LONG TERM. SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING OUR PHASE FOR BOTH THE HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS HI RAJ TRAINING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS -- WE'RE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING OUR SB ONE H. R. C. C. GRANTS ARE FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PRE APPRENTICESHIPS.

WHICH IS A WAY OF DOING WORKFORCE IN INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE WAYS THAT ARE JUST NOT SUPPORTED BY FORMULA DOLLARS THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD PROVIDES THESE MOST FLEXIBLE FUNDS TO TEST INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS. TO SPECIFIC CHALLENGES FACED BY POPULATIONS WITH BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. THE APPLICATIONS WE RECEIVE A TYPICALLY THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE. AND IN FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE FUNDED TWENTY EIGHT PROJECTS. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FIELD THAT INCLUDED COACHES WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE FRIDGE PROJECT. THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING A SEARCHABLE DATABASE FOR ALL ACCELERATOR PROJECTS AND WILL HAVE THAT AVAILABLE THIS YEAR IN TWENTY NINETEEN ALSO.

TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WELL WE PROVIDED A LOT OF BACKGROUND MATERIAL BECAUSE WE PUT OUT WELL OVER A HUNDRED GRANTS -- A YEAR AND A KIND OF COVER ALL THE THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THOSE -- IN A FEW MINUTES IS DIFFICULT BUT BUT WE DID PROVIDE AS MUCH BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND ARE AVAILABLE -- TO DISCUSS ANY ANY OF THOSE GRANTS OR PROGRAM THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. KALRA THANK MEASURES SUCH A COMMENT TO CURTIS -- I APPRECIATE THE THE REPORT OUT AND AND IN PARTICULAR -- AS WE MOVE TO THIS GREEN ECONOMY -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JOBS ARE BEING CREATED A QUALITY JOBS THAT REQUIRES TRAINING. AND THE AND THE THE THE SUCCESS THAT PROP THREE NINE PROPRIETORSHIP PARTNERSHIPS I'VE I'VE HEARD A LOT LA COUNTY IN OTHER PLACES ARE REALLY. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND AND WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW CONTINUING CONSIDERING THE FOCUS YOU ALREADY ARE ON IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD -- TO TO THESE GREEN JOBS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MORE MORE READILY AVAILABLE -- AND AND TO CREATE THAT WORK FORCE -- USING -- SOME THESE VERY CREATIVE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS I'VE JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK IS ALREADY BEING DONE. SAYS THE COMMENT THERE AND THEN OF A GOT A QUESTION AND IS THIS HAS TO DO WITH -- AND I THINK ALL OF US WHO HERE IN DIFFERENT WAYS OF BACK IN OUR DISTRICTS WITH PROP FORTY SEVEN AND THERE IS -- WITHOUT ANY DATA OR EVIDENCE THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS -- EASY SCAPEGOAT HELLO CRIMES GOING UP BECAUSE PROPERTY SEVEN OR THESE DON'T BREAK INS ARE UP BECAUSE PROP. I'M HEARING COUNTSMEMBERS MY OWN COMMUNITY TRYING TO USE IT EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE THE DATA TO BACK IT UP BECAUSE IT'S AN EASY OUT -- AND I NOTICED THAT WITH SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS -- THAT -- THE REPORTS AREN'T OUT YET OR MAY NOT BE COMING OUT OF THE THIS IS THE REASON THE YOU THREE INVESTMENT GRANT PROGRAM. HOW COME THE PROGRAM OUTCOMES REPORT WILL BE -- TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILL GET ONE SOONER ON THE SECOND CHANCE ACT GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS -- WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO THE TO PROPERTY SEVEN WHICH IS GOOD -- BUT I GUESS IS THE SENSE OF HOW TO WE RESPOND IN A GUEST A RETURN ON INVESTMENT WHICH SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA ALWAYS QUESTION LIKE A PRETTY THIS MONEY WOULD BE GETTING OUT OF IT -- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE QUOTE TOUGH ON CRIME FOLKS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO TRY TO FIND ANY. LITTLE OPPORTUNITY -- TO CRITICIZE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT IN ADVANCE OF RECEIVING I GUESS SOME OF THE REPORTS WITH. AUGUST IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER NOW SO I GUESS I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IF ANY THOUGHTS YOU HAVE ON THAT -- ITS OWN TERMS OF AN ANALYSIS WE WOULD DEFAULT TO THESE ANALYSES WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. TO GO OFF OF OTHER THAN THIS INFORMATION -- WE DO HAVE DATE ON A WEBSITE ABOUT CRIME RATES -- BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU IS THAT YOU CAN SORT OF DISCUSS THE TRENDS AND CRIME. OKAY I THINK. MISTER ROBERTS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND THIS ONE S. THAT QUESTION WE DID COME IN -- DURING YOUR PRESENTATION BUT LOOKING FORWARD -- TO DIALOGUE AND AND DIFFERENT DATA COMING FORWARD BUT ALSO -- DOT DATA THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY CENTERS AROUND ONE OF THE HIGHEST POPULATIONS OF THOSE THAT HAS -- PROGRAMS A MEN OF COLOR THOSE AREAS AS THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MOVING THAT UP IN COLLECTING THE DATA THERE'S SO THAT WE'RE HAVING SOME IMPACT ON THAT. TO YOU CARE TO ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND HOW WE CAN GET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION -- SO WE ARE -- WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF BEGINNING THOSE CONVERSATIONS I'M A LOT OF TRAVEL ENTITIES AS YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER RECEIVED FUNDS DIRECTLY -- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO -- A NUMBER OF THE WORK FORCE DOLLARS THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE DOLLARS GO DIRECTLY TO TRAVEL GOVERNMENT SO THEY DON'T WE DON'T ALWAYS GET THAT DATA -- THROUGH OUR STATE WORKFORCE EXCHANGE -- KNOWN AS CAL JOBS I HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S HARD FOR US SOMETIMES OR YOU KNOW ACTUALLY SOMETIMES WE FEAR THAT WE MIGHT BE DOUBLE COUNTING -- SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES BECAUSE THEY MAY BE DIVERT BEING DIRECTLY REPORTED BY TRIBAL ENTITIES ABOUT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING STREAMS RATHER THAN PASSING THROUGH US AS AS A STATE SO. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- WHOSE REPORTING WHAT DATA AND THROUGH WHAT SYSTEMS -- SPECIALLY WITH WITH TRAVEL MONEY WE HAVE A VERY SMALL SLIVER -- THAT -- OF OF FUNDS THAT GO -- TO THE CALIFORNIA -- THINGS INDIAN DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE ONLY HAVE A VERY TINY GRANT -- THAT GO TO TRAVEL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS GO DIRECTLY TO TO TRAVEL ENTITIES BUT WE HAVE STARTED THAT CONVERSATION -- IN OUR RESEARCH SEEM OR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- HOW THAT REPORTING A GOES TO THE FEDS AND EVEN IF IT GOES DIRECTLY TO THE FEDS WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT ALSO -- AS A STATE WORKFORCE BOARD SO THAT WE CAN WORK TO ENSURE -- BUT THERE IS EQUITY IN AND GOOD OUTCOMES IN TROUBLE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION AND MR CHAIR -- ALSO OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL -- FUNDS ARE THERE PARTICULAR TO THE FEDERAL INDIAN RESERVATIONS WE STILL HAVE A HIGH POPULATION OF URBAN INDIANS LIVING WITHIN OUR CITIES WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE MIX IS THE HIGHEST -- STATE WOULD NAY AMERICAN POPULATION SO MAYBE EVEN DIALOGUE -- OUR DATA THAT STARTS. TO LOOK AT THE URBAN POPULATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS WITHIN THE CITIES THAT WE ALL RESIDE IT WOULD BE A VERY -- WELCOMING INFORMATION COMING OUR WAY ABSOLUTELY. RIGHT AND QUESTIONS. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL I'M APOLOGIZING FOR COMING IN LATE BUT I WAS ABLE TO CATCH A LITTLE BIT -- WHILE PREPARING I AM HAPPY TO SEE THAT QUITE A NUMBER OF THE FOLKS WILL BE SPEAKING TODAY ARE NOT ONLY FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY BUT ALSO FROM THE FIFTY FOURTH A SHOUT OUT TO NEW EARTH -- AND ALSO -- VERY EXCITED -- TO KNOW THAT THERE'S CONTINUED INTEREST IN -- VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S FUNDING AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT TRICKLES DOWN -- I KNOW WHEN I WAS AT THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE SECOND CHANCE BOOT CAMP AND ALSO HIGHER LA ACTS WHICH WORK TO CREATE A PIPELINE. FOR A NUMBER OF THE STUDENTS THAT WERE THERE IN -- TO LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND ALSO INTO CONSTRUCTION JOBS -- AT LA ACTS. ONE THING THOUGH THAT I THINK WE DON'T TALK A LOT ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDING -- ARE SOME OF THE LIFE SKILLS THAT ARE THAT ARE NEEDED -- AND PROBABLY DESIRED -- AND WE'RE SO FOCUSED ON BOTH COLLECTING DATA AND THEN PROVIDING FUNDING TO ACTUALLY GET FOLKS INTO CAREERS -- BUT THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE SOFT SKILLS -- THAT ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND THEN BEING ABLE TO GET THE TRAINING AND THEN ULTIMATELY BEING ABLE TO FIND SUCCESSFUL EMPLOYMENT SO YOU KNOW IF FINANCIAL LITERACY FAMILY REUNIFICATION -- EXCEPT ARE A SO DO YOU FIND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE. TACKLING APPROPRIATE LEAD DO YOU THINK THAT WE COULD BE DOING MORE. AROUND THOSE ISSUES IN INTEGRATING THAT INTO THE LARGER CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING AROUND STATE FUNDING AND MAKING AN IMPACT SURE YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- ABSOLUTELY AGREE -- A COUPLE OF COMMENTS THEIR FIRST IN OUR PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM -- LEARNING FROM SOME OF OUR LESSONS -- FROM OUR AB TWENTY SIXTY ARE PROP -- THIRTY NINE PROGRAM -- ON ON CONSTRUCTION CAREERS WHAT WE FOUND -- IN LOOKING AT THE PRELIMINARY DATA THAT WE RECEIVED WAS THAT SUPPORTERS SERVICES WAS ACTUALLY THE GREATEST NEED. AND SO WHEN WE SUBMITTED -- RBC P. FOR THAT PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE LARGEST CHUNK OF FUNDS -- IN THAT PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT GRANT PROGRAM WAS ACTUALLY FOR SUPPORT OF SERVICES -- SECONDLY -- YOU KNOW WE ARE LOOKING TO BUILD STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS WITH CBO'S IN COMMUNITIES -- WHAT WHAT WE SEE IS THAT CBO'S ARE OFTEN BEST PREPARED TO HELP DELIVER THOSE SUPPORTERS SERVICES RIGHT RATHER THAN YOU JUST KIND OF YOUR TRADITIONAL C.T. E. R. R. TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS? RIGHT THERE THERE ARE TRAINING PARTNERS NO WE PARTNER WITH -- A LOT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OTHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONAL -- EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS -- TO PROVIDE ACTUAL TRAINING -- BUT RIGHT IT'S THE CBO'S RIGHT WHO YOU KNOW. HELP FOLKS WHO AFTER HOURS OR BEFORE HOURS OR YOU KNOW IN THE CASE OF OUR CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS DURING THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. RIGHT HELP THEM HELP MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE JOB READY AND ARE GETTING THE SERVICES SO -- ABSOLUTELY AGREE -- WE WE ARE MAKING -- A LARGER INVESTMENT AGAIN AND I THINK PRESENCE ON PLUMAS IS A GREAT INDICATOR OF YOU KNOW AGAIN THE LARGEST. SET OF FUNDS WAS IS DEDICATED TO THOSE SUPPORT SERVICES. AB ELEVEN ELEVEN RIGHT PARTING WITH THOSE CBO'S -- TO HELP DELIVER THOSE SERVICES RIGHT IN ADDITION TO PREPARE THEM FOR AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE SUCCEEDING. IN TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS -- YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING THAT WE LOOK AT HIS JOB RETENTION. RIGHT AND AND ON THAT SIDE RIGHT THAT'S MORE ON THE DEMAND SIDE AND WE NEED TO BE DOING A BETTER JOB OF WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS FOR JOB RETENTION. RIGHT A PERSON WHO'S FORMALLY INCARCERATED A PERSON WITH DISABILITIES RIGHT IT'S ONE THING TO GET THEM TRAINING GET THEM INTO A JOB. RIGHT BUT WE NEED TO BE WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MANAGERS WERE SUPERVISING THESE FOLKS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. RIGHT ALSO HAVE A LOT OF THOSE SAME SKILLS -- SO THAT WE INSURE RETENTION -- WITH OUR WITH OUR WORK FORCE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. YES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR OF FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY WORK IT'S HARD WORK THAT'S BEING DONE AND AM SO NECESSARY. TO APPRECIATE THAT ONE OF THE SAN DIEGO IS IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT PLACE I'M SURE YOU FIGURE THAT OUT BY NOW -- IN TERMS OF PROGRAM YOU SEE A LOT OF LA BUT YOU DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF SAN DIEGO. AND THERE IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE WE FACE OF OF WITH THE PRINT TO SHIP PROGRAMS. IN SAN DIEGO MAKING SURE THAT WE GET TO THE RIGHT KIDS WE ALSO HAVE A REALLY SH -- DIFFICULT CHALLENGE WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES GETTING INTO THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN SAN DIEGO IN THE AREA OF CONSTRUCTION THAT ONLY SENEGAL WOULD STATEWIDE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES -- WE'RE FACING AS A BLACK CAUCUS IS LOOKING AT VARIOUS CONSTRUCTION WORK SITES EVEN HERE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS THE STREET. AND NOT SEEING ANY FACES IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN FACES ON THOSE WORK SITES AT ALL. AND AND WE BUILT OF FEDERAL COURTHOUSE WITHOUT AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE AT ALL ON THE WORK SITE FOR THE USE THAT WAS DONE. SO THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN AND AND WHEN I GO TO I I REGULARLY GO TO PRINT A SHIP GRADUATIONS WITH LABOR. AND I HAVE YET TO SEE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN GRADUATE FROM AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS. SO I'M YOU KNOW I'M KIND OF WONDERING WHAT ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S A GROWING CONCERN THAT IN THIS INDUSTRY. OF NO CONSTRUCTION APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT THERE IS JUST A AN ABSENCE OF A OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND I'VE DONE SEVERAL THINGS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE IN IT AND AND THAT'S BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL BUT THEN -- FORGET GET LABOR INVOLVED I DON'T KNOW HOW INVOLVED THEY ARE WITH YOU BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DOING THINGS AND THEN THEY CAN'T GET THE THE JOBS FROM LABOR TO BASICALLY PARTICIPATE IN OUR PRINT YOUR PROGRAM SO. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE BEING MORE SUCCESSFUL -- I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED IN OUR IN IN THE SENATE COMMUNITY -- NOT BEING REYES WHO IN SACRAMENTO THAT I'M MEETING WITH SOME FOLKS ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION GOING ACROSS THE STREET. AND THERE ARE NO AFRICAN AMERICANS ON THE WORK SITE. SO IT IT'S BECOMING A STATEWIDE ISSUE THE POPULATION SMALL BUT IT'S NOT ZERO SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ARE WHERE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING TO DIVERSIFY. OF THE WORK FORCE ENOUGH THAT WE SEE BEGINS THE BASES THAT ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. RIGHT -- SO WE DO PARTNER -- WITH THE BUILDING TRADES OF AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- ON ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. EXCUSE ME ONE OF THE AS PART OF OUR HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS WE DO WORK QUITE A BIT ON COMMITTED WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS -- WITH BUILDERS AND WITH THE BUILDING TRADES -- TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS DIVERSITY WITHIN THE WORK FORCE THEY'RE USING -- ON CONSTRUCTION SITES SO THAT'S ONE TOOL -- THAT WE HAVE AND THAT WE USE AS PART OF THIS A LARGE PART OF WHY WE'RE PURSUING -- HI ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS -- IS BECAUSE THERE IS AN EQUITY AGENDA THAT IS BUILT INTO THAT -- THERE ARE YOU KNOW A VARIETY OF OF OF REASONS WHY -- WE DON'T QUITE HAVE THE THE EQUITY IN THE DIVERSITY -- OF OUR CONSTRUCTION TRADES WORKFORCE THAT SOMETHING -- THAT WE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM ON AND SO WHAT WE DO IN OUR PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. RIGHT IS IT WORK WITH CBO'S TO DRAW FROM FROM COMMUNITIES RIGHT WE CALL THAT YOU KNOW ARE. THE CALL UP SKILL BACK FILM RIGHT AS WE CAN MOVE IN A WORKERS AB -- WHETHER IT'S IN CONSTRUCTION OR IN PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS OR OTHER INDUSTRIES WHERE WE HAVE GOOD JOB QUALITY. RIGHT WE WORK TO TO BUILD WORKERS UP AND THEN WE WORK WITH CBO'S RIGHT TO DRAW IN ON ON THE BACK FEEL SIDE. RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE READY -- IN DO HAVE -- THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP SKILLS TO GET INTO APPRENTICESHIP RIGHT APPRENTICESHIPS HAVE CERTAIN STANDARDS A LOT OF TIME BUT IF YOU DON'T COME FROM A CONSTRUCTION FAMILY IF YOUR MOTHER FATHER WAS NOT A CONSTRUCTION WORKER OR IN THE BUILDING TRADES YOU DON'T HAVE THAT FAMILIARITY. WITH HOW THE TRADES WORKING -- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW THE THE ENTRY LEVEL REQUIREMENTS -- OF YOU KNOW OF A PARTICULAR TRADE AND SO WHAT ARE PREPARE THE SHIP PROGRAMS DO IS WORK THAT CBO'S ARE ACTUALLY DELIVERING A LOT OF THESE. SERVICES FOR PRE APPRENTICESHIP IN GETTING FOLKS READY AND THEN WE WORK RIGHT WITH THE BUILDING TRADES IN THE LOCAL FOR PLACEMENT -- INTO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS -- SO SO WE ARE WORKING HARD ON THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND WE YOU KNOW WE'D BE HAPPY TO TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU -- ON THAT AND HOW IT'S GOING INTO YOU KNOW SHOW YOU SOME OF OUR OTHER MODELS -- AND I'D BE ABLE IT IN SAYING THAT AS WELL AS SEEING WITH THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE AT THE END. OF THOSE YOU CAN GET INTO THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- BECAUSE LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW WE WE OFTEN SAY EVERYBODY'S NOT GOING TO COLLEGE THAT'S TRUE WE RISE NOT GOING TO COLLEGE -- BUT WHERE THEY GOING IT WOULD NOT OPENING UP SOME OF THESE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM. AND SO THAT'S OF MAJOR CONCERN IN SAN DIEGO I AND I KNOW THERE'S BETTER SUCCESS RATES IN OTHER PLACES THEY TELL ME. BUT WE ARE STRUGGLING IN SAN DIEGO WITH OUR PRINTER PROGRAM AND OUT AND WHETHER IT'S THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR DIRECTLY WITH LABOR I THINK THEY'VE STRUCK SOME ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS BUT NONE THE LESS AS I SAID AS I GO TO THE GRADUATIONS -- ON A REGULAR BASIS I HAVE I HAVE YET TO SEE FOLKS WHO LOOK LIKE ME GRADUATING IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND YET I KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF KIDS. WHO NEED SOMETHING TO DO WHO NEEDS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO A A GOOD PAYING JOB? THAT HAS A CAREER YOU KNOW THAT'S THE AND SO IF IT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE ABSOLUTELY I'D BE INTERESTED IN SEEING YOUR NUMBERS AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR THIS LACKEY. YEAH JUST REAL QUICKLY ON THAT THAT PARTICULAR FRONT I CAN TELL YOU THAT. IN MY DISTRICT THERE'S BEEN SOME GREAT PARTNERSHIPS AS A TO YOUTH BUILD WHICH IS A REALLY GREAT ORGANIZATION. THAT HAS PARTNERED WITH OUR CITY AND THEY HAVE SOME REALLY IS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE -- BROUGHT PEOPLE IN SPECIFICALLY WITH THE IRON WORKERS. AND DOCTOR WHERE WILL BE VERY HAPPY TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE HER THAT ARE BEING VERY SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED IN THAT SYSTEM. THANK YOU LET ME UP AND TO HAVE A QUESTION. JT THE OVERVIEW OF ALL OF THE FUNDING -- AVAILABILITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE CERTAINLY MENTIONING SOME OF THOSE THAT WILL BE ROLLED OUT IN A VERY. VERY SHORT FUTURE. NEAR FUTURE -- THERE WAS A A SIX MILLION DOLLAR OF LOCAL JURISDICTION FUNDING THAT WAS NOT AWARDED DUE TO LACK OF APPLICANTS AND I'M SURE THAT THAT. KINDA RESONATED WITH EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM -- UGLY CONSTANT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT ENOUGH FUNDING. AND CAN YOU CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT THE THAT CHALLENGE. IS A LOOKING LIKE AND WHAT ARE THOSE CRITERIAS IF YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION ON IT. SO I DON'T HAVE THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THE CRITERIA THAT WASN'T MATT -- I WOULD SAY THE WAR ADDITIONAL GRANT APPLICANTS THEY JUST DIDN'T MEET THAT CRITERIA THAT WAS SET. FOR AND SO THE FCC DID NOT AWARD THE FUNDING FOR THEM SO ONE THING IF WE COULD FOLLOW UP WITH WOULD BE GREAT TO KNOW WHAT THOSE CRITERIAS ARE. AND THE WHITE IS THAT -- YOU KNOW PARK ME BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT MEETING THOSE. CRITERIA IS AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE LEAVING SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON THE TABLE FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT WORK. CERTAINLY I'M SURE EVERYONE HERE IS INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW WE GET THAT ON THE GROUND PARTICULARLY THE THE GROUPS ARE HERE DOING THE REAL WORK AND THE EXPENSE OF NETWORKS THAT THEY HAVE. AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SO THAT WOULD BE ONE QUESTION. I DID WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT THE PUBLIC POLICIES TO CALIFORNIA RECENTLY CAME OUT WITH A REPORT. AS THEY WOULD CLAIM IS BECAUSE THE FIRST DEEP DIVE. LOOKING AT BOTH -- REALIGNMENT -- ONE ONLINE AND PROP FORTY SEVEN AGAIN COULD ANY OF YOU MAYBE COME ELABORATE ON SOME OF THAT AND HOW IT TIES INTO. SOME OF THE FUNDING -- THAT YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED HERE IN THIS FIRST THE FIRST THE PANEL. TO SORT OF OR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO YOU ARE RIGHT PP I SEE HAS DONE -- A LOOK AT PROP FORTY SEVEN IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT TO SEE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OF THOSE MEASURES CONTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN CRIME IN CALIFORNIA. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY TRIED. PROJECT WHAT CRIME IN CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE DONE IF THOSE MEASURES WEREN'T PASSED BY LOOKING AT STATES OTHER STATES. THAT HAD SIMILAR CRIME PATTERNS TO CALIFORNIA BUT DIDN'T HAVE A MEASURE LIKE PROP FORTY SEVEN OF THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. HOUSE AND IN THEIR ANALYSIS THEY FOUND THAT -- PROP FORTY SEVEN IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT DID NOT APPEAR TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANY INCREASES IN CRIME IN CALIFORNIA -- THEY DID FIND SOME EVIDENCE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THOSE MEASURES MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN AUTO THEFTS -- BUT NO NO THEY WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE ARE THEY WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS ANY OTHER. INCREASES IN CRIME I WILL SAY THAT SOME OF THE CRITICS OF PROP FORTY SEVEN HAVE ARGUED THAT -- CRIMES AREN'T BEING REPORTED -- AND SO THEY WOULD SUGGEST THAT DESPITE THE EVIDENCE CRIME IS GOING UP BUT BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY TO ASSESS WHETHER THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE IT'S A LACK OF DATA RATHER THAN DATA. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ASSESS WHETHER WHETHER THAT'S TRUE. GOT A QUESTION REGARDS TO THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS -- HAVE WE SEEN EN EXPANSION OF THOSE CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS. ARE THEY THE SAME CENTERS ARE THAT WE'VE HAD FOR SOME TIME I'M JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW -- WERE ADDRESSING THAT THE TRAUMA CENTER AND NEEDS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING THAT THERE IS A STRONG -- ASSERTIVE EFFORT TO TRY TO FUND THE CENTERS OF UP AND DOWN THE STATE. THEY SAID THERE WERE AS I NOTED EARLIER THAT PROGRAM STARTED TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THAT WAS BEFORE THE SECOND FUNDING STREAM OF THE PROP FORTY SEVEN MONEY KICKED IN. AND SO IT ORIGIN IT WAS JUST A HANDFUL OF LOCATIONS -- WHEN THAT FUNDING BEGAN -- THAT PROP FORTY SEVEN PHONED IN WHICH IS FINING CAME INTO IT -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT INCREASE THE NUMBER SUBSTANTIALLY. BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE HAD -- NUMBER DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES COMING -- TO OUR OFFICE TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO EXPAND THESE RECOVERY TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS. UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED QUESTION. I ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. ANY CLOSING COMMENTS FROM THE PRESENTERS LIKE -- TO TO WRAP UP WITH. IN ON ITSELF THANK YOU FOR GIVING US AN OVERVIEW OF THE FUNDING AVAILABILITY AND I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME PARTNERS HERE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN. HEARING AND WHEN WHO WHERE WHAT WHEN AND HOW. ARE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE DOLLARS AND CERTAINLY LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE CRITERIA IS I THINK WE WE WANT TO KNOW. WHAT IT IS THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THEIR IN ORDER FOR THOSE DOLLARS TO GET ROLLED OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT NEED THEM? THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.

PUBLIC EDUCATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE TO HAVE MATH POLICY AND SYSTEMS CHANGE ON BEHALF OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. MY NAME IS MARK FILL PART I'M A MANAGING DIRECTOR OF POLICY LIKE. POLICYMAKERS A FOUNDING MEMBER -- AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS TO MEN OF COLOR. THE ALLIANCE IS A NATIONAL NETWORK OF HUNDREDS OF ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO ADVANCE RACE AN GENDER JUSTICE. BY EXPANDING OPPORTUNITY IN TRANSFORMING STATE AND LOCAL POLICIES THAT ARE FAILING BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. CORONATED BY POLICY LINK THE ALLIANCE HAS DEEP ROOTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH REPRESENTATION OF FIFTEEN COMMUNITIES. INCLUDING COOKS ALLOWED THOUGH NOR YOU SALINAS FRESNO LA COUNTY OAKLAND RICHMOND RIVERSIDE SACRAMENTO SAN BERNADINO SAN DIEGO SAN JOAQUIN SANTANA. SAN JOSE AND CINEMA. AS I REFLECT ON THE LAST EIGHT YEARS AND THE PROGRESS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ALLIANCE OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR THEIR LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES. THESE VICTORIES HAVE -- BROUGHT SO MUCH MORE TO COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE MORE STUDENTSARE GETTING CONNECTED TO THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY NEED TO THRIVE. SAID BEEN PUSHED OUT OF SCHOOL AND INTO THE PUNISHMENT SYSTEM. OUR STATE IS GREATER POLICE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY LOS. FEWER PEOPLE ARE FINDING THEMSELVES IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE'VE IMPROVED ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS FOR WORKERS WHO ARE LOCKED OUT OF OPPORTUNITY. BUT THE REAL STORY OF THE ALLIANCE OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IS THE ONE OF INDIVIDUALS. FROM LEADERS ALL ACROSS THE STATE WHO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY RACISM AND JUST POLICIES AND PRACTICES. COMING TOGETHER AND BUILDING COMMUNITY POWER TO CHANGE THOSE LAWS. SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE ALLIANCE OFTEN LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME OF BRENDA HARRISON. THE LES BRENDA HARRISON FROM STOCKTON CALIFORNIA. MANY OF HIS COMRADES ARE HERE TODAY. BRANDON EXEMPLIFY WHAT THE ALLIANCE IS ALL ABOUT HE WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VICTIMIZED BY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. ARE BY HARSH DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES [inaudible] HE WAS IN MANY WAYS CAST OUT. AND FOUND A HOME WITH FATHERS OF FAMILIES AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM SAMMY IN JUST A MOMENT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DISORGANIZATION. FOUND A HOME AT FATHERS OF FAMILIES FOUND A PLACE WHERE HE BELONGED AND WAS INSTANTLY POLITICIZED. TO CHANGE THE SITUATION THAT HE HAD PLACED HIMSELF AS HE GREW UP IN STOCKTON. HAVING BEEN SUSPENDED AND EXPELLED MULTIPLE TIMES HE WAS COMMITTED. TO REVISING HARSH DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES. ADVOCATING FOR CHANGES IN THE EDUCATION CODE THAT WOULD LIMIT. THE ABILITY FOR TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO SUSPEND EXPEL WITH RECKLESS ABANDON -- REALLY PUSHING A POWERFUL AGENDA FOR CHANGE THAT WAS BIRTH FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE AS I LIKE TO SAY BRANDON MATE BUT HIS MASS HIS MESSAGE -- AND HE WAS OF A VERY PROVOCATIVE AND POWERFUL YOUNG LEADER. THAT IS THE ALLIANCE OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR A NETWORK OF GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS YOU THINK COMMUNITY LEADERS ADVOCATES RESEARCHERS. AND OTHERS WHO ARE FORMING POWERFUL PARTNERSHIPS TO DEEPEN IMPACT AND BUILD THE COLLECTIVE CAPACITY TO DRIVE CHANGE. SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE BRANDON AND OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HAVE WORKED TO CREATE A VISION FOR WORLD THAT'S ROOTED IN IN UNITY. ROOTED IN EQUITY. ROOTED IN A QUALITY FREEDOM AND JUSTICE THAT'S BASED ON MUTUAL SUPPORT STRENGTH LEADERSHIP AND LOVE. WHERE THEIR VALUES? AS WHOLE PEOPLE. AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO FEEL SAFE AND FOSTERS THEIR COURAGE TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR THE CHANGE THAT THEY HOPE TO SEE. AND TOGETHER WE'VE COLLECTIVELY ADVANCED. SAFE AND THRIVING COMMUNITIES WHICH HAVE ENDED CYCLES OF VIOLENCE IN RELATIONSHIPS THAT COMMUNITIES BY ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HARM. INCLUDING TOXIC MASCULINITY POVERTY -- I'M JUST POLICING IN AN EQUAL ACCESS TO RESOURCES. WE'VE WORKED TO BUILD ECONOMIC SECURITY SO NOBODY EXPERIENCES THE INJUSTICE OF POVERTY WE FOSTERED EDUCATIONAL EQUITY BY DISMANTLING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AND WE'RE MOVING THE STATE FROM MASS INCARCERATION TO DIVESTMENT INDYCAR SERRATIA. THIS IS THE VISION AND THE WORK OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN GRASSROOTS LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS MOVEMENT WAS SPARKED BY EXAMINING THE ISSUES THAT DEEPLY EMPAT BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. BUT IT DIDN'T STOP THERE. THE BARRIERS AND THE SYSTEMIC INJUSTICES FACING BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR ALSO. THE THE SAME THINGS THAT IMPACT OTHER MARGINALIZED AND BOUGHT A BOOK COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING GIRLS AND WOMEN OF COLOR. THOSE WHO IDENTIFY AS QUEER TRANCE AND GENDER NON CONFORMING AND CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN DEEP. POVERTY. BIRLIKTE VERY EARLY ON THE FOUNDING OF THE ALLIANCE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE MOST POWERFUL MANIFESTATION OF THE VISION FOR OUR NETWORK WAS ONE THAT WAS INCLUSIVE AND THAT ALLOWED THE LEADERSHIP AND PARTICIPATION OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT. WHILE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR JOINED THE WORK TO ADVANCE THE SOLUTIONS THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES NEED. WE'VE CREATED SPACE FOR THESE LEADERS. TO BRING THEIR EXPERTISE AND LIVED EXPERIENCE TO BEAR TO WIN POLICY BILL POWER. DEEP IN IMPACT AND DISMANTLE RACISTS AND THEN JUST SYSTEMS. ABOVE ALL THIS THIS MOVEMENT AS PRIORITIZE THE VOICE AND LEADERSHIP OF YOUTH OF COLOR WE HELP YOU THINK COMMUNITY LEADERS DEVELOP AN ADVOCATE FOR THE CHANGE THAT THEY WANT TO SEE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN REGIONS. AND OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS WE'VE A BASS OVER A HUNDRED BILLS WHICH HAVE BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW. THE SUCCESS OF THE REPLICA IS A REFLECTION OF THE POWER OF YOU THINK GRASSROOTS LEADERS AND A TESTAMENT OF THEIR LEADERSHIP OF CRITICAL PARTNERS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA FUNDERS FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM. A NETWORK OF FOURTEEN PHILANTHROPIC AT THE TWO INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA OUT WORKING TO ADVANCE THE CHANGE THAT WE'VE OUTLINED. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S ASSEMBLY AND SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE AND ALL OF YOU WHO ARE PARTICIPATING AND REALLY UP HOLDING THIS -- GROUND BREAKING BODY -- THAT HAS REALLY CAUGHT THE EYE OF THE NATION -- IT'S BEEN MENTIONED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BUT IT CAN'T BE MENTIONED ENOUGH THAT -- WE REALLY OWE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO VISIONARY LEADERS ASSEMBLY SPEAKERS KAREN BASS AND OPERATE AS THE INAUGURAL CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE SENTRY SWANSON AND SOME OF THE MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATED LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER VICTOR MANUEL PEREZ. ALL REALLY CHARTED THE COURSE THAT WE'RE ON IN THIS VERY MOMENT. THE SELECT COMMITTEE HAS BEEN -- CRITICAL PIECE TO THE SUCCESS. THE WORK OF THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AND OF THE CALIFORNIA FUNDERS FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. AND THIS VERY UNIQUE ORGANIZING MODEL IS ONE THAT IS -- BEING PARTICULARLY -- EXAMINED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE MY BROTHER'S KEEPER ALLIANCE AND ALL OTHERS WHO ARE LOOKING TO ADVANCE THIS MOVEMENT FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- THIS MODEL ONLY CURRENTLY EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE YOU HAVE ORGANIZING HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IN THE GRASS ROOTS. IN THE LEGISLATURE AND AMONG FUNDERS -- BUT OTHERS ARE TAKING NOTE STATES LIKE LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA ARE TRYING TO MAYOR WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED -- THIS STRATEGY. IS ALSO BEING REPLICATED FOR OTHER POPULATIONS WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- GIRLS AND WOMEN OF COLOR ARE BEGINNING BEGINNING TO ORGANIZE IN THE SAME WAY. AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS -- BECAUSE OUR ULTIMATE END GOAL IS JUSTICE -- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL SHARE. THE FUTURE OF THE MOVEMENT FOR THE BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR WORK IN CALIFORNIA IS A BRIGHT. ONE OUR NETWORK HAS FOUND COMMON CAUSE WITH THE CONSOLATION OF LEADERS THAT FULLY REPRESENT A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES -- FACING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALL OVER THE STATE. IN ADDITION HE WORK HAS EXPANDED BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL SET OF ISSUES THAT -- ARE COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AS CHALLENGES FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. SO RECENTLY THE ALLIANCE'S CENTERED AND PRIORITIZE WORK FOCUSED ON ENDING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN COMBATING MISOGYNY. AND DISMANTLING PATRIARCHY. WE GOT INTO THIS WORK BECAUSE THAT EXPERIENCE MEN WERE FACING WITH VIOLENCE. AT THE TIME THE ONLY WAY THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS WAS TO THE THE ANGLE OF SEEING MEN AS VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. LOOKING AT LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR MEN. BUT THEN AS WE STARTED TO GET DEEPER INTO UNDERSTANDING VIOLENCE WE WE COULDN'T WALK AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT -- IN CERTAIN INSTANCES MEN WERE CAUSING HARM. AND THAT HARM THAT THEY WERE CAUSING WAS PART OF UNRESOLVED TRAUMA. AND SO WE HAD TO GET AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THAT. SO WE'RE ADVANCING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THIS TYPE OF LEARNING COMES FROM A DEEP RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IN OUR NETWORK THE DYNAMIC PARTNERSHIP WITH LEGISLATORS -- AND THE WILLINGNESS OF FUNDERS AND OTHERS -- TO WALK WITH US ON EXPLORING THESE ISSUES. AS I WRAP UP I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT. YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR YOUTH ARE COMMUNITIES HAS INSPIRED HUNDREDS OF LEADERS TO ENGAGE IN A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH MANY HAVE SEEN AS HOSPO. AND NOT FOR THEM. THESE LEADERS CONTINUE TO HAVE FAITH IN THE POLICY MAKING PRODUCT PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE SPACE YOU'VE CREATED. AND THEIR BELIEF AND YOUR SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO A MORE JUST SOCIETY. I BELIEVE AND OUR PARTNERSHIP IN OUR SUCCESS. HAS BEEN PREDICATED ON AN UNSHAKABLE BELIEF THAT TOGETHER WE KNOW THAT WE WILL WIN THANK YOU [inaudible] MR NEWNESS -- NO SHAPE NOT MEANT. TO ALEICHEM -- ONE OFFER -- THANKS TO BROTHER MARK. FOR LIVE IN THE FINAL RENDON. RENDON WAS MURDERED. ON OCTOBER FIFTEENTH. TWENTY SEVENTEEN I WANNA OFFERED THANKS FOR ALL THE LESSONS BRANDED LEFT FOR US. I WANT TO OFFER THANKS TO HIS MOTHER. LISA HARRISON WAS CONTINUE IN HIS NAME THE STRUGGLE. THAT'S SOME INDICATION OF US. AS A STATE. WHAT BETTER IN OUR VOICE? AT THAT CUT DOUBLE RATE. OUR GREATEST ALLIES ARE MOMS OF COLOR. WHO BRING THOSE THEIR BOYS BRING THOSE THEIR HUSBANDS AFTER THEY GET OUT OF THE JOINT? AND SAY PLEASE HELP OTHER ONE LOOSE MY SON. WHEN I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THIS ORGANIZED LIKE THIS? BUT HER I JUST GOT TO SAY. YOU KNOW THE LAST TIME I SAW BRANDON WAS AT SATURDAY WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY ON HIS OWN TIME RUNNING A HEALING CIRCLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OUR YOUNG MEN WE WILL TELL THOSE STORIES ENOUGH. HE WAS A PASSIONATE YOUNG MAN. WOULD BE FILLED BY THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SUSPENDED SEVERAL TIMES PUSHED INTO INCARCERATION I KNOW I WAS THERE WHEN HE CAME OUT OF JUVENILE HALL. KICKING AND SCREAMING TO OUR AGENCY I WAS THERE THE FIRST TIME WE TOOK A FLIGHT I WAS THERE THE FIRST TIME HE PRESENTED I WAS THERE AND YOU WANT AND THE CHIEF OF PROVISIONS OFFICE. AND I SAID WE NEED TO GET ON MY PROBATION IT'S TIME TO LET HIM GO. THAT DAY. THAT DAY ONE BRANDON WAS MET THAT EVENING HE WAS MURDERED THE LAST THING I SAID TO HIM. WAS I LOVE YOU ME HOPE. IS THAT I LOVE YOU AND I'LL SEE YOU MONDAY. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOU MOVING TO THE CALIFORNIA DON'T MEAN DOING ALL THIS GREAT WORK BECAUSE EVERYONE WANTS NOW. BACK THEN THEY DIDN'T LIKE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE HOT THEY'RE ALL ON THIS. THAT'S THE STORY OF BOYS AND MEN THE GOVERNOR IS IN IT. BACK THEN THEY DIDN'T WANT A GERMAN WE STARTED THIS WORK IT WAS LIKE ALL YOU CAN DO IS YOUR RIVERS RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WERE BURIED OUR BOYS. THERE'S NOTHING WHAT IS WHAT IS. HE SAID HE SAYS TO ME THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE ONE OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN MY TOWN. IN MY COUNTY NICE TO WHAT'S UNACCEPTABLE BUT SAVE IN OUR KIDS LIVES. WELL THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT RIGHT NOW WE STARTED THIS WORK A TWO ONE THEY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU CHAIRMAN AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR JUST ALLOW ME TO JUST BREATHE A LITTLE BIT AND SAY THAT ABOUT THAT MUCH. OF ABOUT MY NEPHEW BRANDON HARRISON MAY YOU REST IN PEACE AND ALL THE YOUNG MEN WHO ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW AND HANG HANG ON OUR DECISIONS RIGHT NOW. HOW OLD ARE WE GOING TO BE? IS A RADICAL TO THINK THAT OUR YOUNG MEN DESERVE BETTER AND ALL I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK IT'S REALLY WE NEED A BAND THAT ARC OF JUSTICE WE NEED TO MOVE IT. SO WE STARTED THIS WORK ONE BEFORE THAT WAS AN ALLIANCE WE STARTED WITH THIS WELL AS HE DOES NOW. AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT THE TIME THAT CO FOUNDED THIS FROM THE COACHELLA VALLEY SO WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS CAN SHIP RELATIONSHIP. BECAUSE IN THE END AND PART OF THE STATE THE BACKBONE CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHERE THE MASS INCARCERATION REALLY TOOK SHAPE. AND WE WERE LOCKING UP BOYS AND MEN FOR THE MOST RIDICULOUS OF THINGS SO WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE ANALYTICS LET'S GO BACK A LITTLE BIT. AND REALIZE THE COMPLEXITIES OF REALITIES THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY FORCED OUR YOUNG MEN AND JUST SURVIVE. BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY'RE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW JUST SURVIVE BUT THEN WHEN THE LIGHTS CAME UP I FELT LIKE IT WAS -- IT IT REALLY TRANSCENDED ANY SINGLE ISSUE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE AT THE HEART OF ANY IS ONE SINGLE ONE OF THESE ISSUES YOU GO FIVE BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AT THE ACTUAL CENTER PIECE OF THIS. SO WHEN WE STARTED THIS WORK ONE BEFORE THAT WAS ACTUAL ON THE LIGHTS FORM THE IDEOLOGY OF THIS WORK WE MET AND WE START TALKING WITH ELDERS YOUNG ORGANIZERS AND AND FOLKS THAT WE'RE DOING HEALING WORK AND WE BROUGHT IT ALL TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY MADE SOME GUMBEL OUT OF IT. AND HERE WE ARE TODAY. WHERE WE ARE TODAY SO EVERYONE CAN FEED FROM THIS RIGHT EVERYONE HAS A PLACE OF THE TABLE SO I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT? THE THE WORK IN STOCKTON HAS BENEFITTED TREMENDOUSLY BY THIS WORK IN YOUR BODY AT YOUR DECISIONS STOCKTON HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED STOCK AND AT ONE POINT WAS THE MORTGAGE MELTDOWN CAPITAL OF THE WORLD IT WAS THE LARGEST METROPOLITAN CITY TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY. IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. IT WAS ACTUALLY A STATE WHERE YOU AT A HIGHER IT WAS THE CITY WE GOT A HIGHER CHANCE OF GETTING SHOT MURDERED. THEN YOU DID IN CHICAGO OR IRAQ AT THE TIME. AND THERE WAS WE CAME AND PLEADED WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF SCHOOL SUSPENSION WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE POLICING IN SCHOOL THAN CITATIONS GIVEN TO YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR SO MUCH SO. THAT THE DEAL J. ACTUALLY JUST SETTLE WITH OUR DISTRICT AND SAID THOSE POLICIES WERE DISCRIMINATORY. THERE WERE RACES POLICIES WHAT THEY SAID SO HOW DO YOU HILL FROM RACISM GOT A KNOWLEDGE OF FIRST. WE GOT A KNOWLEDGE OF WE'RE GOING TO HEAL FROM IT FIRST. AND THOSE WERE POLICIES BORN OF THE SPIRIT TREATMENT IN THE COLLECTED DIRECTLY TARGETED OUR PEOPLE SO AT THE END OF THE DAY THE HOUSING MARKET THE VIOLENCE RATE. THE EDUCATION HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF ILLITERACY SO WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO THAT CAN YOU LEGISLATE LOVE. GOOD WE'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT LEGISLATING HATE IN THE STATE BUT I SEE IT HAPPENING NOW WHEN THERE'S EVIDENCE OF THAT MIGHT WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ALL TALKED ABOUT WE'RE REALLY RESONATED WITH US BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW ON THE GROUND. IS THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TAKING A LOT OF THIS THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND TRANSFORMING OUR CITY WE HAVE THE YOUNGEST AND FIRST BLACK MAYOR IN OUR CITY THAT WAS REALLY. AREN'T OR GALVANIZING POINT IN OUR CITY WE ARE ACTUALLY ONE OF ELEVEN TOM RECOVERY CENTERS AND HAVE AN EXCELLENT TRACK RECORD TO PROVIDE THE HEALING SERVICES. TO THE YOUNG MEN OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR WHO MAKE UP CONSTITUTE THE HIGHEST RATE OF BY THAT GUN BY THE HOMICIDES THE QUESTION HOW MANY OF RECEIVED. IMPERATIVE HEALING SERVICES NONE. THE REACTION FROM THE STATE HAS BEEN INCARCERATION IN AND POLICING. AND THIS ACTUAL BODY AT THAT POINT TEN YEARS AGO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE STATE BUDGET WAS AT AND NOW WE ACTUALLY WHISPERING A UNIVERSITY IN STOCKTON. THERE'S WHISPERS OF THAT RIGHT NOW SO IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING AND THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE BEFORE. AS A YOUNG MAN I WILL SAY THIS THAT ARE AT FIVE YEARS OLD I STOOD UP TO DOMESTIC COULD TO VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. AT THIRTEEN YEARS OLD PUSHED OUT OF SCHOOL FIFTEEN YEARS ON THE CLOSER TO JUVENILE HALL EVERY SINGLE TIME ONE OF THESE MODES ISSUES HAPPEN I WISH SOMEBODY WAS THERE. I WISH SOMEBODY WAS THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MAN THERE MIGHT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD MOMS WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS JUST TO TRY TO SURVIVE. ALL THE MEN HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT BECAUSE THE WAND WOODS OF WAR GETS MY COMMUNITY. SO ALL THE MEN WERE GONE. SO WE HAD TO FEND FOR OURSELVES AND ORGANIZE OURSELVES. AND SO EVERY SINGLE TIME WHEN I WAS LIKE THIRTEEN YEARS OLD FIFTEEN YEARS OLD CAN INCARCERATED BY THE TIME I BECAME A FATHER I WANTED SOMEBODY TO HELP ME HOW DO I BECOME A GOOD FATHER. I DON'T HAVE ANY EXAMPLES. IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SO I WAS SOMEBODY WAS THERE. AFTERWARDS I GOT SHOT WITH A TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN LEFT FOR DEAD. I WISH SOMEBODY WAS THERE FOR ME. AFTERWARDS HAD CUT INCARCERATED MYSELF BECAUSE HOW DO YOU NOT HOW DO YOU STAY CLEAN IN A MUD PUDDLE AS THEY SAY RIGHT. THE REALITY IS IS THAT THE GENERATIONAL RESPECTFUL RECIPROCAL FORM OF VIOLENCE THAT HAD GRIPPED OUR CITY GRIPPED OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WAS REAL AND WAS VERY NOW OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE STORY OF BRANDON WAS PLAYED OUT YOUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL. ANY SETTLES DAY IN SAN DIEGO IN SOUTH LA AND OUR RESERVATIONS. AS WELL. AND SO THIS WAS A THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE LIKE NONE OTHER. BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK WE'RE DEMONSTRATING TODAY SOONER OR LATER WE GOTTA HAVE MORE BACKBONE THE WISHBONE. I'LL TELL YOU THIS THAT LASTING SO WE'RE RUNNING THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER. THAT'S WORKING WITH YOUNG MEN OF COLOR WE HAVE A HEALING SCHOOLS WE JUST STARTED THE MCKINLEY AND AND ARE NOW GOING TO SEVEN SCHOOLS THAT'S THE ANSWER. TO ACTUALLY THE PUNISHMENT AND CONTROL MODEL THAT HAS REALLY PUSH SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR LIKE BRANDON OUT OF SCHOOL AND TO REPEAT INCARCERATION WEBER TOM INFORMED WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT A LOT OF THE FOLKS WERE HERE EARLIER TODAY ON PAROLE THERE RIGHT NOW VAST BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE OUT THERE. WORKING THEIR FATHERS AT WORK THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT JUST FELONS THEIR FATHERS AND I JUST PRISONERS THEIR PARENTS AND THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE DIGNITY OF HAVING A ACTUAL GOOD JOB NOT ONLY THAT BUT ALSO DEALING WITH THE UNRESOLVED TRAUMA PAIN AND SHAME THAT THEY'VE SUFFERED WITH. AND THEN LASTLY WE HAVE THE LOWEST RECIDIVISM RATE IN OUR COUNTY SO IT'S ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE NOT COMPELLED BY THE MORALITY. OF IT THEN THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF IT SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR. WE HAVE A SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON PUNISHING PEOPLE OF COLOR IT'S TIME TO RECONCILE THAT AND WE'VE STONE THAT IT'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL WE PARTNER UP WITH COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS -- AND I THINK RIGHT NOW THE BRAND STORY OF BRANDON IS ACTUALLY OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SCALE UP BE BOWL THAT BRANDON WAS A BE BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS. IN THIS WORK LASTLY I'LL SAY THIS THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN WALKING BY OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO STOP YOU COME BY OUR NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER YOU'LL SEE. YOU'LL SEE COMMUNITY THERE YOU'LL SEE MOVEMENT YOU'LL SEE HEALING YOU'LL SEE IT FOR YOURSELF AND YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF THE COMPLEXITIES THAT WE'D HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH THE NUANCES. ABOUT WE CONFRONT THESE ISSUES WE DON'T SHY AWAY FROM THEM THIS YOUNG MAN CAVE MAN HE WAS LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AND THEN INTO THE OFFICE I SHOULD SAY. AND HE COMES WALKING IN THE US AS HE SAYS WHAT DO YOU OFFER YOUR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU NEED. HE GOES HOW LONG YOU BEEN OR JUST ABOUT ALWAYS. I WILL TAKE A LOOK AROUND ACTUALLY WAS A ME WAS AN ELDER THAT CAME UP TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND. ANYONE LOOKED AROUND AND SAW THIS PICTURE THIS LIVE PICTURE OF A FAMILY THAT WAS CONNECTED CHILDREN THAT WERE PROTECTED. ELDERS THAT WERE RESPECTED. AND HE SAYS I WANT THAT FOR MY COMMUNITY. CAN I GET THAT WE IGGY WAS GIVEN SOME SEATS. THE BILL ON THE TABLE HE LOOKED ON THE SEAS LOOKED UP AT THE ELDER. LOOK DOWN AND WALKED OUT WITHOUT THE SEEDS. BECAUSE HE WAS TOLL FORTY NUMBER ONE THE WORK THAT WE'RE HERE TO DO MAY NOT BE REALIZED IN OUR DEBT LIFETIME BUT LET'S START IT. NUMBER TWO WOULD TAKES A LOT OF WORK WITHOUT BOASTING A BRAG IN THE BODY JUST GOT TO DO THE WORK NUMBER. THREE IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF HARD WORK AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY. NOT EVERYONE BILL FOR IT. WE'RE STILL THERE FOR THAT YOUNG MAN WHEN HE COMES BACK BUT THE QUESTION IS ARE WE GOING TO TAKE THE SEEDS AND WORK IT TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE THE KIND OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WOULD ALL OF OUR CHILDREN DESERVE -- I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M SORRY IF I WENT OVER I JUST I APOLOGIZE -- THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. CALPERS MODEL MODEL WITH CALIFORNIA DOWN -- GOOD MORE GOOD AFTERNOON ALBER MALDONADO WITH -- WITH CALIFORNIAN DOWN MAN AND ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR ROSSI HE WANTED ME TO EXTEND APPRECIATIONS TO TO TO YOU CHAIR -- GARCIA AS WELL AS THE THE CAN THE COMMITTEE HERE. ALL AND JUST ONE OTHER ONE OTHER NOTE FROM DOCTOR ROSS -- YOU KNOW WELL HE CAN'T BE HERE HE SENT HIS REGRETS HE WANTED ME TO CONVEY -- TO TO BOTH THE THE ASSEMBLY COME SELECT COMMITTEE ON BOYS A MINUTE COLORS WELL IT'S WERE PARTNERS THAT ARE THAT ARE HERE WITH US TODAY -- THAT WHILE WE'VE BEEN WITH YOU FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS WE REMAIN COMMITTED FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS -- TO REALLY YOU KNOW -- ACT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH WITH FOLKS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE SUPPORT OUR OUR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SO ON THAT NOTE I JUST REALLY WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A JOURNEY IN IN SHARING HOW THE IN DEL MAN HAS COME INTO -- OUR WORK AROUND BOYS MEN OF COLOR -- AND SO REALLY OVER THE LAST DECADE -- YOU KNOW WE REALLY PARTNERED AND YOU KNOW WITH WITH A LOT OF THE FOLKS HERE IN THE ROOM AS WELL AS THE THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE TO REALLY GET IT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ROOT CAUSES -- THAT ARE YOU KNOW CONTRIBUTING TO THE STRUGGLE OF GENERATIONS OF BOYS AND YOUNG MEN OF COLOR ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN BOB MOST DISENFRANCHISED -- SO WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM FROM SAMMY ABOUT BRANDON STORY AND BRENDAN HARRIS AND CERTAINLY HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT AS ONE OF OUR PRESIDENT YOU COUNCIL MEMBERS -- HE AT ONE POINT AS WE WERE ASKING BRANDON ABOUT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE STATE SHOULD LOOK LIKE HE CHALLENGED US TO THINK THROUGH AND AND AND AND COME UP WITH WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE HARVARD FOR YOUTH ORGANIZING WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENT -- OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BUILD THEIR LEADERSHIP SKILLS SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET DEEPLY INVOLVED -- IN IN IN IN IN CHALLENGING AND AND AND AND STRUGGLE AND IN STRUGGLE. ALL SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A BACKGROUND ON THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT IS A PRIVATE HEALTH FOUNDATION OUR MISSION IS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTHCARE. FOR UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IN MY VIEW TO PROMOTE FUNDAMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH STATUS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WE DON'T FOCUS ON PRESCRIPTIONS WE FOCUS ON ON FIXING BROKEN SYSTEMS AND OUTDATED POLICIES. WE DON'T FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL BUT WE DO FOCUS ON THE LARGER COMMUNITY AS AN ECOSYSTEM OF HEALTH AND HOW TO BUILD COLLECTIVE VOICE. POWER AND ADVOCACY WE WORK WITH CITIZENS AND ELECTED LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE TO FIND LASTING SOLUTIONS FOR SCALE WILL IMPACT THE DRIVE HEALTH AND RACIAL JUSTICE. SO I THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS YOUNG PEOPLE AND OUR PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS OVER THE LAST DECADE TO BETTER ADDRESS THE WELL DOCUMENTED RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. THAT EXIST ACROSS A BROADER WAY OF A RAY OF ECONOMIC AND HEALTH DOMAINS. ADVERSELY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA'S BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. THESE DISPARITIES HAVE DEVELOPED AND PERSISTED OVERTIME IN THE CONTEXT OF HISTORICAL AND STRUCTURAL RACISM. THAT IS SHAPE POLICIES SYSTEMIC PRACTICES INSTRUCTED PROGRAMS IN WAYS THAT CREE DISADVANTAGES FOR CERTAIN GROUPS. VS HISTORY ANY INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF DISADVANTAGE HAS MET THAT SUCH INEQUITIES HAVE PERSISTENT PROFOUND AND LONG LASTING GENERATIONAL AFFECTS THAT IMPACT ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY. THE SUBGROUPS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OUR LOW INCOME BOYS AND YOUNG MEN OF COLOR. IN RECOGNITION OF THIS PROFOUND ADVERSE EFFECT OF RACE AND GENDER ON THE HEALTH OF POOR COMMUNITIES THE CALIFORNIA DEL MEANS -- IDENTIFIED STRATEGIES TO CLOSE THE HEALTH GAP FOR BOYS AND YOUNG MEN OF COLOR AS A STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE OF OF TCP. WE REALIZE THAT WE CANNOT HAVE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA UNLESS MEANING FULL CHANGE HAPPENS TO ADDRESS THE NEGATIVE HEALTH TRANS EXPERIENCE BY BOYS AND YOUNG MEN OF COLOR. IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT HAS NOW INVESTED MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM. THOSE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE GRANTS TO CBO'S DATA CONVENING BRING IN OUR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TOGETHER TO REALLY ADDRESS THE POLICIES AND SYSTEMS AND PRACTICES. THAT CONTRIBUTE TO DISPARITIES OUR FOCUS AREAS HAVE INCLUDED -- REDUCING CHRONIC ABSENCE KEEPING KIDS HEALTHY GETTING KIDS BACK ON TRACK AND INTO SCHOOL ADDRESSING. ADDRESSING SAFETY AND JUSTICE TO THE LANDS OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND ULTIMATELY CONNECTING YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE HEALTH SUPPORTS THAT THE NEED -- FOR FOR A CORPORATE CIVIL THAT HAVE GUIDED OUR WORK ON BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR -- INCLUDE. OUR I ACTUALLY LET ME LET ME START THAT OVER MY BAD -- BEFORE COURT PRIORITIES THAT GUIDE OUR WORK ON BOYS AND YOUNG MEN OF COLOR -- ROUTE ONE BOYS AND YOUNG MEN OF COLOR ARE IMPORTANT ASSETS TO CALIFORNIA AND THEIR FAMILIES TWO BOYS ME POSITIVE CONNECTIONS TO ADULTS GENERALLY THROUGH MENTORSHIP AND MEN SPECIFICALLY. THREE BOYS AND YOUNG MEN OF COLOR MUST BE SEEN ENGAGED AS CONSUMERS AS ADVOCATES AND AS LEADERS AND FOR POLICY AND SYSTEMS CHANGE EFFORTS MUST BENEFIT. THE LIFE CHANCES OF BOYS AND YOUNG MEN OF COLOR. OUR BOYS A MINUTE COLOR WORK EXPLICITLY CALLED OUT REYES AND COMMITTED TO LIFTING UP. THE VOICES OF YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR IN AN INTENTIONAL IN STRATEGIC WAY. IT WAS REALLY ROOTED IN THE IDEA OF FOCUSING ON THE MOST EXCLUDED POPULATIONS WITH AN EXPLICIT FOCUS ON RACIAL JUSTICE OUR BOYS THEM IN A COLOR WORK. HAS REALLY TRANSFORMED THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT SPECIFICALLY AND HOW WE APPROACH OUR WORK IT PAVE THE WAY FOR US TO TO DEEPLY INVESTING YOUTH LEADERSHIP IN ORGANIZING AND VOICE. TO PUT TWO BY INCUBATING STATEWIDE YOUTH MOVEMENTS. FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED IN ISSUES THAT MOST IMPACT THEM. A ALSO AS MARK MENTIONED EARLIER PAVE THE WAY FOR T. C. E. TO WORK WITH SPECIFIC GROUPS LIKE QUEER AND TRANS YOUTH SYSTEMS IMPACTED YOUNG PEOPLE IMMIGRANT YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL AS NATIVE YOUTH ACROSS THE ACROSS THE STATE. ARMED BY CREATING PATHWAYS SUPPORTING LEADERSHIP AMONG THE QUOTE ON QUOTE MOST IMPACTED THIS WORK HAS LED TO DEEP SUPPORT FOR LOCAL AND STATEWIDE STRATEGIES. TO ADDRESS POLICY THROUGH AN INTERSECTIONAL LENS OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE YOUTH AND ADULT ORGANIZER THAT SUPPORT THEM. IN MANY WAYS BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR HAS SERVED AS A LEARNING LABORATORY LABORATORY FOR THE CALIFORNIAN DOWN ME. TO REALLY THINK THROUGH OUR INTER GENERATIONAL AN INTERSECTIONAL APPROACH ON POLICY IN THERE TO CHANGE STRATEGIES. A FEW HIGHLIGHTS. ARM AS MENTIONED EARLIER BOYS IN A COLOR HAS PROVIDED THE BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE ALLIANCE OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR COORDINATED BY POLICY LINK SCHOOL DISCIPLINE WITH ONE OF THOSE CATALYZING ISSUES EARLY ON THAT REALLY. CONNECTED YOUNG PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO REALLY ADDRESS ISSUES TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE IN IN IN SCHOOL AND ON TRACK TO GRADUATE. OF SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THAT WE'VE SEEN AS WELL AS PROMISING MOMENTUM. ON THAT I JUST WANT TO LIFT UP AS I BEGIN TO CLOSE IS. AS WE THINK THROUGH SCHOOL DID SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE REALLY TAKEN UP THE MANTLE OF ADDRESSING A PUNITIVE APPROACH AND ARE MOVING MUCH MORE TOWARDS A RESTORATIVE IT NOW AND AN UPSTREAM APPROACH. GOVERNOR NEWSOME RECENTLY CALLED FOR THE END OF THE GIVE YOU THINK CARTS REGION AS WE KNOW IT AND WE WERE OR SEEN JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE. INCLUDING SAN FRANCISCO -- AND LA ADVANCING -- SIGNIFICANT DIVERSIONARY APPROACHES -- AND SO THERE ALSO IS ALONG THE SAME LINES THE MOVE TO REALLY MOVE PUBLIC RESOURCES AWAY FROM HARM HARM AND TOWARDS RESTORATION HEALING AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. THE IT THE IMPACTS OF GENERATIONAL TRAUMA AS NOTED EARLIER HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ON OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. A COUPLE OF OTHER AREAS THAT I WANT TO LIFT UP. IS THE EMERGENCE OF COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP AS NOTED HERE -- WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW REALLY REALLY ROBUST COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AT THE CBO LEVEL CERTAINLY LET UP BY POLICY LINK IN THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. AMONGST FUNDERS -- WHERE FUNDERS HAVE REALLY COME TOGETHER BOTH HERE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE FUNDERS FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR? AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO THE EXECUTIVE THE LIGHTS FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AND CERTAINLY AS MENTIONED EARLIER -- WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA -- YOU KNOW REALLY CHAMPIONING THE MY BROTHER'S KEEPER EFFORT. THERE'S ALSO REALLY STRONG PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS MEN OF COLOR. IN REALLY FORGING A STATEWIDE OF OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO FIND THEIR VOICE -- AND FOR US TO ADVANCES DENOBLE STRATEGIES -- SO IN CLOSING. I JUST WANTED LIFT UP THAT BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR REALLY HELPED US. BOMB TO REALIZE THAT WE NEEDED TO TARGET OTHER POPULATIONS AS WILL BE ON DISADVANTAGED BOYS AND MEN YOUNG MEN OF COLOR WE REALLY STARTED TO ENGAGE OUR YOUNG WOMEN IN AN EVER CALLED SISTERHOOD RISING -- ENGAGING OUR NATIVE AMERICAN YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL AS UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH -- SO I THINK FOR ME. OF THE LAST THING THAT I'LL SAY IS THAT THE BIG LESSON LEARNED FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR FOR THE ENDOWMENT WAS THAT WE REALLY CAN'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND AND SO WE REALLY AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR WORK FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS HOW DO WE THINK THROUGH -- NOT LEAVING ANYONE ELSE BEHIND ANY OTHER CALIFORNIANS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE TIME IN AN OPEN -- TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT THEY BI&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt; ACCENT QUESTIONS WILL GO ON NEXT NEXT PRESENTER MISTER DALE.

THE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMPILERS NETWORK AND SO WHEN IT KNOWLEDGE MY ANCESTORS -- COME FROM -- MAY HE GO FROM QUITE IS BUT ALSO -- THAT BELONG COULD BE TAKEN -- NATIVE FROM OF TEXAS SIR MY RELATIVES. BEEN THERE DIDN'T CROSS THE BORDER BEEN THERE ALL ALONG. AND THE THE BEEN THERE FOR MANY GENERATIONS BUT I WAS RAISED IN COMPTON SO I GREW UP IN COMPTON WHAT SOUTH CENTRAL LA. SOME STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON -- AND RATE IS REYES NO BLACK BROWN NEIGHBORHOOD WAY WAY BACK AND AND PART OF MY HISTORY PART OF MY OF OF YOU KNOW MY IT TEACHING. IT WAS DURING THE FIRST. YOU KNOW THE RIOTS THERE. MIGHT BE AN IN HIGH SCHOOL A IN IN THOSE RIOTS AND AND BEING VERY AFRAID TO WALK HOME -- NOT BECAUSE OF THE OTHER FOLKS THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE NATIONAL GUARD POLICE WITH JACK US UP AND SO WE HAD REPAIRED OUR LAST PERIOD TO SEE WHO'S GONNA WALK WITHIN SPECIFIC CYZICUS SPECIFICALLY. NUMBER THE GIRLS WOULD SAY WOULD YOU WALK US HOME BECAUSE THEY THEY WITH THE THE THE POLICE AND THE NATIONAL GUARD WOULD WITH THE SEXUAL ASSAULT THEM SO. AS A YOUNG BOY WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT VERY EARLY ON AND SO SAYS SPECT OF JUSTICE IN. AND AND TRAUMA -- WAS JUST PART OF WHAT I THOUGHT LIFE WAS IN AND AND GREW UP THAT WAY AND DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS PART OF THE THE THE THE PROCESS -- I WAS ABLE TO GO ON YOU KNOW IF OF MY SACRIFICE MY MOTHER IN THE SEMI MENTION MOTHERS IN AND THE GRANDMOTHERS IT REALLY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE PRAYER AND ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW. THAT OF THE REALLY SAVED US BUT I WAS ABLE TO GO ON AND AND AND BEGIN TO DO THIS WORK WAY BACK IN THE SEVENTIES AS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST IN -- BUT BUT REALIZE THAT THE WHAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME WAS NOT REALLY HELPING US. REALLY THEY WERE THEY WERE TEACHING US -- TO TO TO DIAGNOSE AND AND MEDICAID -- OUR POPULATION AND NOT REALLY DEAL WITH WE REALLY WHAT WAS GOING ON IN. AND AND AND AND WE FOUND AND WORKING A NUMBER OF US IS THAT WAY BACK IN THERE THE THE EIGHTIES AFTER WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LONG TIME AND COMMUNITIES THAT. THAT THE INEQUITY WAS THERE WE STILL NOT GETTING SERVICES. WAS STILL NOTHING GETTING THINGS OF A CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FOR US. AND SO WE DECIDED TOGETHER NUMBER OF US -- MEN DECIDED TOGETHER BECAUSE IT WAS A DUALITY WAS GOING AWFULLY FELT IN EQUITY GOING ON A COMMUNITY. BUT AS AS AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE ALSO FELT THE SHAME. THAT A LOT OF THE THEHURT THAT WAS GOING ON WE'RE GOING ON BY OURSELVES THAT WE WERE. BEING DOMESTICALLY VIOLENT CHILD ABUSE IS GOING ON SEXUAL ASSAULT WAS GOING ON GANG VIOLENCE WITH KILLING OURSELVES. AND AND WE CAME TOGETHER NUMBER OF US MEN CAME TOGETHER BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WE SAT IN A CIRCLE WE KNEW ENOUGH. TAUGHT BY GRANDMOTHERS THAT WE START WITH PRAYER. WE START WITH PLAN WE ASK CREATE ANY ANCESTORS HELP US OF OUR PEOPLE HEARD. WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP THE SYSTEMS THAT HELP IN THIS EDUCATION NOT HELPING US YOUR GUIDE. WE LOOKED AT FIRED ASK FOR SOME HELP. AND THE AND IT WILL BE WE ASK FOR THAT WE WE WE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WE WE WANTED ANSWERS TO HELP US IN. AND SO WE WENT AROUND THAT ROOM AND BEGIN SHARING WHO WE WERE WAS OUR INTENT IN THE SECOND BROTHER IN SAID I WANT HELP MY COMMUNITY BUT THE PROBLEM IS. I'M BROKE. I DID HAVE A DEAD. I EXPERIENCE A LOT OF TROUBLE BY THE POLICE AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOVE MY KIDS. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE CLOSE TO MY WIFE. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HEAL ALL I DO IS DRINKING GET HIGH. AND I'M A LAWYER. ON THE SUCCESSFUL. ONE AND AS WE WENT AROUND THAT ROOM ANOTHER WAS THERE WERE SO CALLED SUCCESSFUL REALIZE THAT WE WERE ALL. WE WERE THE LEADERS WITH THE POLITICIANS WITH THE LORD IS WITH THE SOCIAL WORKERS AND WE WERE ALL MESSED UP. THAT'S WHAT THAT DAY. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH IS THAT THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY THING WE NEEDED TO DO WAS HE LOST SALES AS MEN. BECAUSE WE ARE BRINGING THAT TRAUMA THAT IT DIDN'T COME TO US THROUGH ALL THE OPPRESSION THE RACISM IT WILL BRING IN A TOP HOMES AND FAMILIES. AND THE EDUCATION WAS NOT GOING TO SAVE US A JOB WAS NOT GOING TO SAVE US THAT WE HAD INTENTIONALLY DO OUR HEALING WORK WITH INTENTIONALLY LEARN ABOUT THE SACREDNESS OF WHO WE REALLY WERE. RECOVERED THE SACRED IDENTITY OF WHO WERE BLACK BROWN NATIVE MEN CALL THAT BACK AND THEN CHOOSE TO LIVE THAT. AND THAT WAS THE IMPETUS OF THE NATIONAL COMPOSITES NETWORK. THAT WE AS MEN DECIDED THAT WE WERE GONNA STEP BUT BEFORE ANY CAMPAIGNS ON ANYTHING ANYBODY DO IT WE DECIDED TO DO IT. AND THE YOU KNOW SAMMY CAME ALONG A NUMBER OF OTHER BROTHERS CAME ALONG AND AND JOINED US AND WE PRAYED AND WE MADE COMMITMENTS IN THE OTHER COMMIT WE MADE. IT'S GOING TO PASS THIS ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION. SO FOR THIRTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK AND WE INCORPORATED AND AND AND NOW -- WE OUR FOCUS IS ON HEALING. OUR FOCUS IS THAT WE DON'T HEAL. YOU KNOW WHATEVER IS NOT TRANSFORM GETS TRANSFERRED. YOU GIVE SOMEBODY A JOB YOU CAN GIVE EDUCATION YOU CAN MAKE A POLITICS. RIGHT BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD HAVE POLITICIANS SO -- WE ALL GOT HERE AND WE KNOW THIS WILL BE POLITICIANS BECAUSE BECAUSE WE'VE WE FIND NOW OUR COMMUNITY SUFFERING FROM TRAUMA FROM FEAR. WE WE WORK THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT AND OTHER OTHER FOUNDATIONS IN AND ARE PART OF THE NETWORK HERE. AND AND SO THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING REALLY IS IS HOW DO WE BUILD CAPACITY IN PART OF BUILDING CAPACITY IS WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE THE SYSTEMS. AND I WANT TO LIFT UPBECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SAYING WE NEED MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE NEED MORE SOCIAL SERVICES BUT LET ME JUST. CHALLENGE THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND AS OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS OVER MEDICATED AND AND AND AND OVER DIAGNOSED OUR KIDS SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GIVING MORE FUNDS. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING MORE SOCIAL SERVICES NOT JUST YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU DO THE WORK LIKE FATHERS AND FAMILIES AND ENCOURAGES SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT DO THEIR OWN INTERNAL KEELING WORK INTO THEIR OWN. UNCONSCIOUS BIAS WORK AND RE TRANSFORM EVERYTHING THAT ALL WE DO IS REPLICATING THE OPPRESSION. WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN SCHOOLS. AND WE'RE FINDING IS SCHOOLS THE BREEDING GROUND FOR MANY TIMES THE THE LACK OF INTEGRITY THE KIDS HAVE. BEGIN TO ASSIMILATE THEM INTO A PROCESS AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS IS GOOD BUT IF YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY TYPE A TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE IN THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN THE WAY EDUCATION IS GIVEN. ALL WE'RE DOING IS BANDAID. SO WE IN OUR PROCESS WOULD WE LIFT UP IS CHALLENGING SYSTEMS TRANSFORMING SYSTEMS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF MODELS THAT WE CAN LIFT UP IN THAT WAY -- YOU KNOW IN IN IN MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES AND AND WE PROVIDE A LOT OF CAPACITY BUILDING FOR A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FATHERS AND FAMILIES AND OTHERS ACROSS THE THE THE STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN THE SCHOOLS WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO IN IN THE IN YOUR DISTRICT TO SENATE GARCIA TO WORK IN THE COACHELLA DISTRICT AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THE REPRESENTATIVE HERE TODAY AND WE FOUND THAT YOU KNOW WHEN A DISTRICT IS WILLING TO DO A DEEP DIVE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS YOU GOT TO START WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT TO THE MINISTRY ALL THE WAY DOWN AND REFORMULATE HOW THEY SEE OUR KIDS. GOOD MANY TIMES OR EVEN LIKE OUR KIDS THEY'RE EVEN SEE OUR KIDS BUT THE OTHER THING IS THEY DON'T SEE OUR FAMILIES. THEY DON'T SEE THE TRAUMA THAT THEY GO TO AND NOW WE HAVE KIDS THAT ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE ICE. AND AND AND IMMIGRATION IS ALL AROUND THESE KIDS WE'RE SEEING YOUNGER AND YOUNGER KIDS SUFFERING FROM FROM ANXIETY DISORDERS FROM THE FROM DEPRESSION. FROM SUICIDAL IDEATION. YOU KNOW AND AND THEY GOT TO GO HOME AND NOBODY'S HELPING THE PARENTS NOBODY'S HELPING THE FATHERS WE GET A LOT OF FATHERS THAT COMING OUT OF PRISON. AND AND SOMEBODY WAS ASKING OKAY SO AS THE CRIME RATE GOING UP WHAT THE CRIME ISGONE UP THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE IMPLICATION ON THE SYSTEM THEY DIDN'T DO GOOD BY THEM WHEN THEY'RE INSIDE. RIGHT. SO SO SO WHAT IS IT IMPLICATING WE SEE THIS IN AND SO A LOT OF OUR WORK IS ON HEALING WE YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE. TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT. THESE LAST TWO YEARS TO DO A A LISTENING TO WHAT YOU WANTED TO TEN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. AS SURVEYED -- AND AND DID LISTENING GROUPS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE YOUNGSTERS WITH THE ELDERS AND ELDERS RIGHT. AND AND THEN AS ADAM IN A CIRCLE AND ASK THEM WHAT YOUR FORMS OF STRESS WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU STRUGGLE WITH. AND SO WE NOW HAVE A HAVE A REPORT LIMóN REPORT BUT I WANT I WANT TO SHARE SOME THINGS WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE SAID WHAT THE COMMUNITY SAID THAT A STRUGGLE WITH IN TERMS OF STRESS. THEY SAID WE ARE BIRD WE'RE BURDEN BY SYSTEMS WE'RE BURDEN BY COMMUNITIES WE'RE BURDEN BY BY -- ESTABLISHED WITH THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR TRAUMA DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR PAIN. WE HAVE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS THAT IS STILL STRUGGLING WITH THEIR OWN TRAUMA AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT WITH US THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GUIDE TO NURTURE US BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT HEALED THEIR GENERATIONAL PAIN. AND CAN BARELY SURVIVE THEY SAID WE THE AS YOUNG MEN OF COLOR WE STRUGGLE TO ADAPT TO RAPIDLY CHANGING DIVISIVE MILITARISTIC SOCIAL WORLD THAT EXPECTS A LOT FROM US. BUT OFTEN DISCRIMINATED DOES NOT NOT PROVIDE GUIDANCE NURTURANCE OR EVEN A SPACE FOR US TO BE. AND WE OVERWHELMINGLY GOT FROM THEM WE NEED A PLACE TO BE. JUST TO BE. WE WANTED PLACE TO BE WHAT WE COULD FEEL SAFE WITH IS GETTING OLD STORES IN ELLE'S ELDERS IN THERE. THAT WE CAN TALK TO THE WE CAN ASK ABOUT HOW DO WE CROSS THIS RITES OF PASSAGE BRIDGE. AND THE OTHER THINGS THEY SAID SYSTEMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CIVIC AND HEALTH CARE THAT. THAT THAT ARE CONNECTED TO WITH THAT DON'T DISCONNECT US FROM WHO WE ARE AND DON'T PUNISH THIS FOR BEINGWHO WE ARE. SO THEY STRUGGLE FROM THE TRAUMA AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU COPE. LOT OF NUMB WE SAT DOWN WE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT WE JUST TRIANGLE ON LOT OF US JUST WILL BATES SMOKE SOME WEED. YOU KNOW JUST TRY LISTEN TO MUSIC TRYING AND AND AND SOMETIMES IT COMES OUT WITH THEIR WOUNDED MISS BEGINS TO WILL NOT. SO THAT THE VIOLENCE THE DRUGS THE ALCOHOL ALL OF THAT STUFF AS WELL. AND AND SO PART OF OUR EMPHASIS AND AND I WHAT I WANT TO LIFT UP -- THE BROTHERHOOD OF ELDERS OUT OF OAKLAND. AFRICAN AMERICAN A GROUP THAT WE'RE WE HAVE A COLLABORATION WITH THEM WE COLLABORATE WITH NATIVE GROUPS CAN DETECT COLLABORATE WITH THE BROTHERHOOD VALDRES WE HAVE HAD WE HAD WANTED TO LONG BEACH BECAUSE IN IN THE LISTENING TO IN LONG BEACH THE SAID THAT THE BLACK BROWN WAR. GOING ON RIGHT. SO WE HAD TO GO IN AS BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS AND SAY NO LET'S SIT TOGETHER LET'S TALK TO LET'S HILL TO GET RIGHT WE NEED TO BRING MORE OF THAT COLLABORATION AND SO -- ONE OF ONE OF OUR FOCUSES IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS IS TO BUILD A HEALING INSTITUTE WE NEED TO HAVE AN ORGANIZATION WE NEED TO HAVE A FOCUS WHERE HEALING GOES ON ON GOING AND THEN WE BILL COMBAT CAPACITIES IN COMMUNITIES. THE TRAUMA CENTERS OR IMPORT BUT I'M A TELL YOU I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER TRAUMA CENTERS BUT NOT ANOTHER ONE LIKE LIKE FATHERS OF FAMILIES. YOU KNOW AND SO YOU CAN BUILD THAT KIND OF MODEL WHERE THE HEALING IS GOING ON INTERNALLY AND PLUS YOU BRING TRAUMA THAT I SEE TO TRAUMA CENTERS BUT DOING TRAUMA CENTERS BY THEMSELVES. SOMETIMES WE JUST RE EXACERBATE OF THE TRAUMA RIGHT SO SO I WANT TO LIFT UP THE ASPECT OF HEALING THAT WE NEED TO TO REALLY -- PLACE FUNDS AND SUPPORT EFFORTS THAT ARE CULTURALLY BASED BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR OWN HEALING CAPACITY IN OUR OWN CULTURE THAT WE CAN LIFT UP THAT WE CAN BUILD ON THAT IS TRAUMA INFORMED AND NOW EVERYTHING IS FROM INFORMED. BUT THE PROBLEM WITH TROUBLING FORM IS NOW YOU CAN USE THAT IN A RACIST WAY AS WELL. RIGHT SO IT CAN'T JUST BE TRAUMA FORM HAS TO BE HEALING SENATE. AND AND AND I'M GONNA YOU KNOW IT I'LL I'LL END. BY BY BY SHARING A STORY. OF THIS YOUNG MAN THAT THAT CAME OUT HE HAD BEEN LOCKED UP FOR FOR YOU NOT YOUNG IS FIFTEEN YEARS. HE BEEN THE SHOOT WE HAD BEEN LOCKED DOWN IN THE SHOE FOR FLOAT TWELVE OF THOSE FIFTEEN YEARS. ANY SAYS WITH IT WITH YOU KNOW THIS HE GOT OUT ONE HOUR A DAY HE WOULD PRAY. HE WOULD PRAY THAT DURING THAT HOUR THAT HE WOULDN'T GET YOU KNOW STAB THOSE KILLED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO YOU PRAY EVERY DAY. THAT AND BELIEVE IN PRAYER UNTIL I GOT LOCKED UP IN THE SHOE HE SAYS AND AND EVERY DAY I WOULD BE SO SCARED OF MORE SCARED TO BE IN MY LIFE AND IT FINALLY CAME OUT AND WE CAME OUT HE CAME TO SEE ME. AND HE CAME TO SEE ME YES I HEARD YOU CAN YOU YOU CAN HELP IT MY HEALING AND AND HE SAYS BUT WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH RIGHT NOW IS -- THE P. O. FINALLY GAVE ME PERMISSION TO GO SEE MY KIDS. IS THIS AN APPLE OR SCARED THAT I'VE EVER PAID. I'M MORE SCARED THAN IT WAS IN THE SHOE. BECAUSE I'M AFRAID BY KIDS WON'T. PHRASE MY KIDS WILL LIKE ME I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE A FATHER. I DON'T NOT EVEN. EVEN APPROACH THEM I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE A BAND BECAUSE I WAS LOCKED UP WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND I FEEL LIKE I'M STILL. FOURTEEN AND I SAID SOME COME HERE AND HOW DID. HE SAYS YOU KNOW YOU THE FIRST MAY HAVE THE CIVIL HUGGED ME. YOU KNOW. SO THE REALITY OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. IS SOMETIMES THAT CONNECTION. IT'S NOT COMPLICATED. BUT WE GOT TO COMMIT WE GOT TO COMMIT TO FEEL. WE GOT A COMMITTED TO HEAL. AND WE GOT TO COMMIT TO LEAD NOT JUST IN PROGRAMS NOT JUST AND JOB DEVELOPMENT BUT WE GOT A BREAK THE GENERATIONS OF TRAUMA.

ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY GREW UP AND WHERE THEY GO WHERE WHERE THEY COME FROM THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHETHER IT'S TAKING THEIR KIDS THE THEIR YOUNGER BROTHER SISTER TO THE SCHOOL AND ENSURING THAT THEY GET TO SCHOOL. AND THEY MIGHT BE A LITTLE TARDY AND THIS ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES JUST DON'T WORK WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ENSURING THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY ARE YOU PUT ADVOCATE FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES AS LAW. I THINK SOMETIMES -- SITTING DOWN IN THE DISTRICT AND WHEN I READ -- STUFF THAT WE WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE ETHICAL.

IT HAS TO BE DONE WHEN WE BRING OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH THOSE -- TWO AT THE IN IT AT THE END IT IS THIS WORKING TO CONTINUE. MORE INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES I NEED TO BE MADE -- TORE GONNA TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM THE RUINS OF THE INNER CITIES BECAUSE OF THAT DAY IT'S IT'S WE TALK ABOUT THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. BUT THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS IT'S IT'S VERY VERY TELLING AND LIKELY SHIP LIKE. I KNOW THAT WITH YOUR WORK AND I WORK IN THE COMMUNITIES WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GO A LONG WAY AND WE'RE HERE TO LEND A HAND. AND YOU KNOW JUST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY THANK YOU [inaudible] Q.. ANY QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF THE PRESENTERS HERE ON THIS PANEL COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DOCTOR WEBER OF I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU -- FOR FOR HONESTLY SHARING OF THE JOURNEY THAT YOU'VE BEEN ON AS WELL AS THE JOINING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE -- SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW WE ARE -- TRANSFERRING DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND I HAVE GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THE MOVE AND I'M HOPING THAT SOME OF YOUR INVOLVED WITH IT BECAUSE I AS CHAIR OF THE THE PART THAT PART OF THE BUDGET I INSISTED THAT THERE. IS A COMMUNITY ADVISORY GROUP -- BECAUSE OFTENTIMES FOLKS IN IN EVEN IN THE CONVERSATION WANT TO SIMPLY MOVE THE ONE AGENCY TO THE NEXT AGENCY. WITH THE SAME PEOPLE AND THE SAME KIND OF THING THAT'S TO OCCUR AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH DEEPER. OF AND IF WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY TRANSFORM OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THAT IT DOES ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUES WE FACE RATHER THAN JUST SIMPLY CHANGING THE LOCATION FROM WHICH A PERSON. GETS A PAYCHECK. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO THAT ANY OF YOU ABOUT THAT -- BECAUSE WE ARE PERFORMING THAT WAS IN THE BUDGET NAP INSISTED THAT IT BE THERE MAINLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE THE DEEP CONVERSATIONS BUT SHOULD BE OCCURRING WHEN YOU MAKE SUCH A MAJOR MOVES. AND PEOPLE AT EXPECTATIONS BUT THERE WAS NO PLAN AND I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S RIGHT. UP THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION DOCTOR WEBER AND YOU KNOW AS AS SOMEONE WHO'S REPRESENTING -- COMMUNITY OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE -- POURED OVER THIS AT LENGTH -- YOU KNOW I I'D LIKE TO ALSO SAY WE WE SHARE THOSE CONCERNS -- YOU KNOW I THINK THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR FIRMLY BELIEVES IN THE THE IN THE CLOSURE OF YOUTH PRESENCE -- WE BELIEVE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE -- DO NOT NEED TO BE INCARCERATED -- AND WE WE SEE THIS TRANSITION AS SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP YOUNG PEOPLE -- BUT WITHOUT THE OVERSIGHT WITHOUT THE DEDICATED KIND OF COMMITMENT TO SHRINKING THE POPULATION WITHOUT ANY CONTROLS AROUND THE BUDGET -- WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IT COULD BE BUSINESS AS USUAL -- THAT INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE VERY DEEP -- STRUCTURAL HARMS AND AND THE THE VERY DEEP -- BRACE RACISM THAT EXISTS THAT ALLOW SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BE IN THAT PARTICULAR POSITION FOR THE SAME CRIMES THAT WHITE KIDS. COMMIT -- YOU KNOW WE STE WE BELIEVE THAT -- WE JUST NEED TO DO AWAY WITH IT ALTOGETHER -- AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE WE STAND -- IN IN THAT COMMUNITY OF CONCERN WITH YOU -- WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND FOR SOME MODICUM OF OVERSIGHT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED WITH WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE ON THE LEADERSHIP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED. BY DJJ -- AS PART OF THE OVERSIGHT BODY -- WE WE WE HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN BUT WE DON'T KNOW. AND I SAW I DON'T SEE A CULTURAL COMPONENT WHICH IS OF RIGHT. WHICH IS SOMETIMES SO ESSENTIAL. TO UNDERSTAND THE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE BUT MORE IMPORTANT AS YOU POINTED OUT. THE UNDERSTAND THE STRENGTH THAT COMES FROM UNDERSTANDING WHO YOU ARE. AND I'VE VISITED OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN GHANA ONCE AND I WAS. I WAS OF A JUVENILE HALL SAYS SITUATION WHEN I WAS THE VISITING ONE OF MY TIMES AND AND I WAS AMAZED AT THAT THE PREMISE UPON WHICH THE ORGANIZATION WAS BUILT THAT WHEN KIDS ARE ARE. ARE ARE PLACED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM OR DO SOMETHING THAT IS WRONG THEY HAVE TO GO BACK AND HE'LL THE FAMINE AND SO MUCH OF THE EFFORT WAS TO TALK ABOUT. HEALING THE FAMILY BECAUSE IF THE FAMILY WORKED IN THE CULTURE WORKED THEN YOU'D GET THE OUTCOME THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE WHICH IS A RESPECTFUL ENGAGE YOUNG PERSON AND SO WHEN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. THEY GO BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID WRONG WHAT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CULTURE THAT CAUSES YOUNG PERSON NOT TO RESPOND IN THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD. A TO THE VALUES THAT WE IN THE COMMUNITY ITSELF IT'S AN ON IT'S IT'S QUITE A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A KIND OF A SOCIETY THAT DOESN'T WE DON'T OPERATE ON VALUES. YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T GIVE OUR KIDS THAT THE THE FEELING THAT YOU ARE NOW EIGHT WEBER AND THAT MEANS SOMETHING. YOU KNOW WE DON'T DO THAT AND SO. UP YOU KNOW AND SO AS A RESULT THAT THAT THAT THAT PIECE IS BROKEN. IS NEVER PUT BACK AND THEY JUST KIND OF BUMP AROUND WITHOUT A ANCHOR -- DOUBLE GOAL THE DAY'S SUPPOSED TO CHEAT AS A MEMBER OF A FAMILY IN A COMMUNITY. SO I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT NOT BEING THERE AND SO I'M I'M HOPING THAT YOU FOLKS WILL BE WATCHING GEN THAT YOU WILL BE SHARING WITH US I'D STILL WHICH I CHAIR THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET SO. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ASKED TO HAVE THINGS COME BACK TO US SO THAT WE GET A CHANCE TO REALLY ASSESS -- WHAT IS HAPPENING IN WHETHER NOT IT'S REALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE? IT'S ALSO ARE CONCERNED WITH THAT AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM. REALLY HAVE NOT. BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS HELPED US TO TO REALIZE THAT THE TRUE SACREDNESS THAT WE HAVE IN THE KILLING POWER THAT WE HAVE. AND I AND I THINK IT WOULD REALLY WHERE WHERE THE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE IS AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND WE FOUND IN SCHOOLS THE YOUNGSTERS CAN HEAL YOUNGSTERS -- YES THAT THAT THEY KNOW HOW THEY THEY'RE THE CLOSEST TO EACH OTHER THEY THEY CAN DETECT WHEN ONE OF THE PARTNERS IS OFF SCALAR. TALKING ABOUT SUSE I MEAN THAT YOU KNOW SO SO HOW DO WE EMPOWER. YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO EMPOWER GRANDMOTHERS IN MY THAT MEAN THERE'S YOU KNOW BECAUSE IN WEIGHT WHEN I GREW UP IN AND HAVE NO HEALTH CARE MY MY GRANDMOTHER HE'LL MEGAN AND THE END. OF A LADY DOUBTS SO I THINK THIS STILL THAT WE NEED TO RE FRAME THE WAY WE LOOK AT THIS AND AT THE THE OTHER PART. IS THAT YOU TO WHERE WE DO A LOT OF CAPACITY BILL OUT OF TRAINING BUT WE DO A LOT OF FUN TRAINING. TO LOT OF THE WORK WE DO IS ON TRAINING PEOPLE IN THEIR MENTALITY. AND YOU KNOW A LOT A LOT OF TIMES IN WE'RE TALK ABOUT SERVICES WE DON'T TALK ABOUT. TA DOLLARS A TRAINING DOLLARS A CAPACITY BUILDING DOLLARS WE JUST SAY LET'S IS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT WAY. SO DEFINITELY WERE INTERESTED AND AND YOU KNOW AND WE'LL BE WATCHING BUT ANYTHING YOU COULD PROVIDE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING SURE THAT HAPPENS -- I THINK WOULD BE A WELCOME THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES SOME NUMBER CALLED. THANK YOU MICHELLE I THINK ALL OF YOU -- IN IN. TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT BY THEIR INDIVIDUAL STORIES OR THE MOVEMENT THAT'S BEEN CREATED OVER. THE LAST DECADE WHICH HAS BEEN. QUITE REMARKABLE -- THINK IF HE CAN THINK ABOUT -- HOW MANY DECADES AS CANNELLA JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS BEEN BUILT -- AND THE SYSTEMS EVEN THOSE THAT PURPORT. TO BE THERE TO HELP -- IT HAD NOT BEEN DESIGNED THAT WAY AND IT KIND OF CREATES AS MOMENTUM THAT IS REALLY HARD TO STOP. AND TO IT I'M JUST VERY GRATEFUL THAT IN IN PRETTY SHORT ORDER OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY INBAL HERE FOR THE NEXT PANEL THE WORK TO BE EASY WE STILL HAVE YET TO DO. OTHER WE ALL OF KNOWLEDGE BUT REMARKABLE IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY -- IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN THIS BUILDING -- I GET A LOT OF CREDIT. TO THE LEGISLATORS THAT WERE HERE A DECADE AGO BECAUSE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE. TO TAKE THOSE INITIAL STATS WITH ALL OF YOU. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW IT BOTH COURAGEOUS AND AND HOW CYNICAL PEOPLE WERE SKEPTICAL AND CRITICISM THAT WAS RECEIVED -- AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO COME HERE AND JOIN A LEGISLATURE THAT IS HAS ALREADY HAS THAT. MOMENTUM BUILT THANKS TO ALL OF YOU SO MANY OF THE FOLKS HERE THE AUDIENCE AND OF COURSE MY COLLEAGUES. THAT I SHARE THE DíAS WITH AND SO -- I HAS ONE DOG OF THANKFUL I AM AND YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU THE MISTER THEY'LL YOU SAID AS I GET ALL CSU DON'T SEE OUR CHILDREN. I I THINK THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT WHAT DOCTOR WEBER IS TALKING ABOUT IS CHANGING THAT. MENTALITY IN OF IDENTITY -- AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT EVEN WHAT'S WHAT CAME OUT IN THE NEWS RIGHT NOW WHICH I DON'T THINK ANY OF US ARE REALLY SURPRISE ABOUT. ABOUT THESE BURKE BORDER PATROL OFFICERS AND HOW THEY'RE SPEAKING AND TALKING DOWN. TO THOSE THAT ARE BEING INCARCERATED ALONG OUR BORDERS. THEY DON'T SEE THE HUMANITY IN THOSE. IN THOSE MOTHERS AND FATHERS THEY DON'T SEE THE AMENITIES AND THOSE CHILDREN AND BABIES I DON'T SEE THEM. FORGET EQUALS THEY DON'T EVEN SEE THEM AS HUMAN. AND THAT IS WHAT. WE'RE CONTENDING WITH WILL MERGE MANAGE MOVEMENT TO TURN THIS SHIP OF INCARCERATION AROUND. IS THAT -- WE'RE TRYING TO INSTILL THE HUMANITY IN OUR OWN CHILDREN BUT WE FIRST UP IS STILL IN OURSELVES. AND THE WORK YOU'RE DOING IS DOING THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AND I'M JUST A YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT REGARDLESS. OF THE OBSTACLES WE FACE THE WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE. THAT IT'S IT'S GENERATED NO WILL TAKE A GENERATION OR MORE. FOR THIS WORK TO REALLY STEP SEVEN BECAUSE IT'S SO INGRAINED IN OUR SYSTEM IN OUR HUMANITY OF WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE OF MY AS INDICATED YOU KNOW. THE BEFORE YOU KILL ANYONE ELSE OF THE HERE SELF AND I THINK THAT. THIS IS LIKE A DISEASE INFECTED OUR NATION ARE VERY MUCH SO INTENTIONALLY -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT GENOCIDE IS. GENOCIDE IS NOT JUST PHYSICALLY STRIPPING ONE OF THEIR LIVES OF THEIR LIFE OR STRIPPING THEIR CHILDREN AWAY -- IS STRIPPING THE IDENTITY AWAY THE CONNECTION WITH OUR HISTORY WITH A CULTURE WITH WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE YOU CAN EITHER DO IT PHYSICALLY OR YOU COULD DO IT MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. AND THAT GENOCIDE HAS HAS SLIPPED INTO THESE COMMUNITIES OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT YOU NOW ARE ARE HEALING. AND IT DOES TAKE TIME TO DO THAT AND YOU KNOW AS SUB ARE PART OF OUR BOARD MEMBER I'M NOT DALY GALARZA. BEAUTIFUL NAME -- WAS TALKING ABOUT THE PAVING OF THE ROADS AND WHAT HAVE YOU I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GREAT ANALOGY -- BECAUSE IT TOOK SO LONG JUST TO GET THOSE ROADS PHYSICALLY PAVE IN YOUR COMMUNITIES THANKS THE WORK REPRESENT AS YOU HAVE LIKE LIKE -- ARE CHAMBERS GARCIA AND OTHERS -- BUT THAT'S THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL LIKE THAT THA GETTING YOUR MOSTLY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE SMOOTHLY THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCK. AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU WHAT'S ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU NEED IN YOUR COMMUNITY. AND SO I THINK THAT THE LAST TEN YEARS YOU ALL HAVE BEEN PAVING THE ROADS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID A LONG TIME AGO. YOUR YOUR PAVING ROADS THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. AND I THINK NOW IS THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND AND MANY DECADES TO COME IT'S ABOUT WHAT ELSE WE HAVE TO BUILD IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BEYOND THOSE BASIC NECESSITIES OF JUST FUNDAMENTAL IDENTITY AND AND FEELING VALUED AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU IS A LONG WAY OF SAYING THANK YOU.

A BE GONZALEZ EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS FOR COULD TELL BY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE ALSO FOR A YOUR A PARTICIPATION. WE WILL BE HAVING A PUBLIC COMMENTS AFTER THIS PANEL. OF FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE WOULD LIKE TO CHIME IN. ADD TO THE CONVERSATION AS WELL AFTER THIS LAST PANEL -- WE CAN BEGIN [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE YOU WANNA. THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF BEING HERE TODAY AND I WILL KEEP MY REMARKS BRIEF OF THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED. FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST IS I THINK MUCH OF WHAT YOU PROBABLY NEED TO HEAR HAS BEEN SAID -- PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND PANEL -- TODAY. AND SECONDLY BECAUSE ONE OF MY PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES. IN THIS WORK IS TO BE A GOOD FATHER MYSELF. AND AS OUR HIS ROOM LATE MY PHONE IS BUT THEN BECAUSE I HAVE TWO YOUNG BOYS TO PICK UP -- WHO PICKING A DEBT TO SHOW UP? AND I WILL MAKE SURE THAT I GET THAT DONE -- TODAY ON TIME. I'M SO THAT I AM LIVING UP TO THE VALUES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DOES RELATES TO BOYS AND YOUNG MEN OF COLOR -- IN CALIFORNIA. MY NAME IS CHET YOU WOULD ON THE CO PRESENCE HERE HEALTH FOUNDATION THE CENTER IT'S YOUR HEALTH -- WE ARE FOUNDING MEMBERS AND THE MANAGER THE CALIFORNIA FUND IS FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. COLLABORATION OF SENIOR LEADERS FROM FIFTEEN OF FOUNDATIONS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT AND LIBERTY HILL FOUNDATION WHO ARE REPRESENTED HERE TODAY -- AS WELL. OUR COLLECTIVE BE MOC WORKERS GUIDED BY LIFE BECAUSE FRAMEWORK. A CRADLE TO CAREER APPROACH TO IMPROVING OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE LIFETIME OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR A HEARING CALIFORNIA. AT THE CENTER IN ADDITION TO ADMINISTRATING CIPM ALL SEE WE HAVE RESPONDED TO THE RECOGNITION. THAT OUR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. FACE INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS TO OPPORTUNITY FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADULTHOOD WITH PROGRAMS IN THIS IS LIKE MY BROTHER'S KEEPER HERE IN SACRAMENTO BILL BLACK. AND A POSITIVE JUSTICE INITIATIVE WHICH IS ELEVEN COUNTY EFFORT TO TRANSFORM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OUTCOME FOR YOUTH OF COLOR -- AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF THEIR GENDER ALTHOUGH COMMENTS TODAY HERE ARE REALLY FOCUSED. ON BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE STAFF TO SEE A BMO SEES REGIONAL ACTION COMMITTEES AND SUPPORT THE EFFORTS TO ALIGN. AND LEAD COMMUNITY SPECIFIC PARTIES THE PROMOTE EQUITY INCLUSION OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. BY ENSURING THEY HAVE ACCESS TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION COMPLETION OF COLLEGE DEGREES. DISMANTLING AND TRANSFORMING YOU'VE JUST TO SYSTEMS. PROMOTING DISSIPATION ECONOMY BY MAKING EMPLOYMENT TRAINING ANNOUNCEMENT OR OPPORTUNITIES MORE ACCESSIBLE. I JUST WANT TO NOTE BUT I KNOW YOU HEARD TODAY. FROM THE FOLKS FROM THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY ACT. THE DEPARTMENT LABOR HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE THING THAT'S ONE ON THE SCHOOL THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO GOING FORWARD AS WE THINK ABOUT THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THE KIND OF INCENTIVES THOSE SYSTEMS HAVE SIR NOT SIMPLY FOCUSED ON DISLOCATED WORKERS BECAUSE THEY ARE PERFORMANCE SYSTEMS. NOT TENDS TO MAKE THEIR WORK WITH DISADVANTAGED YOUTH LESS KIND OF INTERESTING TO THEM AS THEY TRY TO PRODUCE GOOD NUMBERS. SOMETIMES YOU CAN MEASURE THE WRONG THINGS. SOMETIMES YOU SIMPLY MEASURING WHETHER YOU GOT FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE LOST THE JOB ANOTHER JOB. THE MOST POWERFUL THING YOU CAN DO WITH WE OWE IT IS TO GET FOLKS WHO HAVE CONTINGENT WORK OR WHO HAVE NEVER INTO THE WORK FORCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE. SO. EVEN AS WE THINK ABOUT MEASUREMENT THESE ARE WE THINK ABOUT THE POWER OF THOSE PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF A CORNICE LEGISLATURE GOING FORWARD. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE INCENTIVES TO ENSURE THAT THE METRICS THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO ON METRICS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR WHO SHOULDN'T BE LEFT OUT A WORKFORCE WITH THE BUILDING A NEW STATE BUILDING. NEXT DOOR OR WHETHER YOU'RE BUILDING HOUSING IN A REAL YARDS OF SACRAMENTO WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THE HOMELESS PROBLEM IN LOS ANGELES WE NEED THESE YOUNG MEN TO HELP REBUILD A SOCIETY. THAT HAS LOTS OF NEEDS AND THEY HAVE THE TALENT THE TOOLS THE INTENTION THE INSPIRATION TO DO SO SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE AN OBSTACLE. THE MAKING THAT HAPPEN SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT POINT GOING FOR BECAUSE I THINK -- OTHERWISE WE LEFT A LOT OF GREAT LEGISLATION WHICH DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO CHANGES IN PRACTICE IN COMMUNITIES WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY NEED. THAT'S WHERE WE START OUR BELIEF. THAT'S WELL WORK COMES FROM THAT'S THE THE THE PLACE THE CENTERING THAT WE DO AROUND THE WORK OF THE FOUNDATION AND WITH OUR COLLEAGUES MORE BROADLY. SO YOU KNOW THE QUESTION OF US RESPOND TO WHAT WE KNOW WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT TO EXTEND -- TEN YEARS LET ME START BY THAT. OFTEN MY RESPONSES QUESTION BIKE KNOWLEDGE I'M SURROUNDED HERE TODAY BY ADVOCATES OF VARIOUS STRIPES WHO DOING GREAT WORK. THE LIFE OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR CALIFORNIA FUND IS FOR A BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE ITSELF AND CLEARLY ADVOCATES WHO WORK IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE WHAT TOGETHER BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCCESSFUL FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA REQUIRES THE VISION TALENT AND CUT REASON OF ALL OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE -- THIS WORK AND THE RELATIONSHIP IN CONNECTION TO THIS BODY. AND THE BODIES IT'S CONNECTED TO IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE GOT TO CONTINUE. AND ABOUT ALL THE YEARS THAT WE HAVE BEEN FUNDING THE BUILDING OF INSTITUTIONS. IN CALIFORNIA THE LARGEST BUILDING OF PRISONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. OUR COMMITMENT TO BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR SHOULD MERE OUR COMMITMENT TO THE BUILDING OF THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM. IF WE DID IT FOR THIRTY YEARS WE SHOULD BE FOR TALKING ABOUT. THIRTY IF WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CREATE THAT HARM REPARATION CITIES COMMUNITIES SUGGEST WE SHOULD SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FIXING THE HARM THAT WE'VE CREATED IN CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AND SO I THINK THE NEXT TEN YEARS I'D LIKE TO SEE. SUSTAINABLE YOU KNOW FUNDING AND A COMMITMENT TO A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP TO GET THIS JOB WORK FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF FOLKS WHO SIT IN YOUR SEAT -- SIT MIND OR NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION GOING FULL. SECOND WHILE THERE'S A LOT TO BE PROUD OF IN OUR COLLEAGUE MARC PHILPOTT TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE HUNDRED PLUS BILLS THAT WE HAVE A FOCUSED ON WE SEE A SHIFT IN THE WAY THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE LEAVING THE SEPARATE. ALL THINKING AND ACTING AND THEY NEED PERMANENT LEGISLATIVE ACTION. HELLO WE KNOW THAT THIS GOOD THE LEGISLATION THAT PRECLUDES EXPLOSIONS TO SCHOOLS ABOUT TO EXPIRE. NINE THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM TO FIX. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THAT WASN'T THE KIND OF KIND OF INFORMATION THAT SUCCESS THAT SUGGEST THAT TO BE A PILOT PROJECT. RIGHT THAT'S NOT A PILOT. THAT WAS PERMANENT HARM THAT WAS DONE IT NEEDS PERMANENT SOLUTIONS AND SO WE NEED POLICY NOT. NOT NOT SET TO SUNSET AT SOME POINT. BUT ACTUALLY MAKES A PERMANENT CASE FOR WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR OUR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. GOING FORWARD FUNDING FOR THAT IS IMPORTANT. I'M GONNA QUICKLY SAY THAT I'D BE REMISS AS SOME OF THE THE MAJORITY ABOUT WORK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY A CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY KNOW THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. AVAILABLE FUNDING BETWEEN OUR LARGER COMMUNITIES ON AND WEALTHY COMMUNITIES ON THE COAST AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AS WELL -- I TESTED IN THE YEARS GOING FORWARD BUT YOU DO ALL YOU CAN TO HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE SOME EQUITY. I IN EQUITY IS NOT THE SAME AMOUNT SOME FAIRNESS AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT RESOURCE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE FACING A DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT MANIPULATE SOME MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN. YES THIS IS BLUE CALIFORNIA WITH A LOT OF WRITTEN THE STATE THAT WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE. THIRD THE STATE HAS IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN BE PURPOSING EXISTING FUNDS FROM HARMFUL PITIFUL SYSTEMS TOLD OF ELEMENT OF A MORE EXPANSIVE CONSUMER OF CARE FOR SYSTEM. IMPACTED A YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT'S JUST MY WAY OF SAYING THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO DO NOT JUSTICE FUNDING TO CREATE THE KIND OF INCENTIVES THAT FORCE COUNTY TO DO THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. AND I ACTUALLY DON'T BELIEVE I'M A FORMER COUNTY WELFARE DIRECT THEM A FORMER CHILD WELFARE DIRECTOR IN ALAMEDA COUNTY PROUD PUBLIC SERVANT BUT I BELIEVE THOSE SYSTEMS WILL NOT DO ALL THEY CAN. UNLESS YOU CREATE THE KIND OF INCENTIVES -- AND MANDATE REQUIRE THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO SO AND IT'S WITHIN YOUR POWER TO ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND WE WOULD CALL ABOUT HIS BODY TO MAKE SURE THAT IS INDEED AND IN FACT. WHAT TAKES PLACE? WE HAVE THE RESEARCH WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS PARTNERS GREET EXPAND THESE ALTERNATIVES AND PROMOTE NEW THINKING ABOUT WHAT A BELOVED COMMUNITY FOR ALL YOUTH. LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT IS FULLY ACTIVATED -- AND IS LEVERAGING THE POWER IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF COMMUNITY GROUPS THEMSELVES FOURTH WE TO PRIORITIZE MOVING UPSTREAM. WE GOT TO WORK WITH YOUNGER AND YOUNGER KID. NO IT'S OKAY AND IT'S GREAT TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH KIDS WHO ENGAGE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT MANY OF THOSE KIDS WERE ONCE. IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. WE KNOW HOW THAT HISTORY AND HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE A TRACK YOU HEAR A LOT OF TALK TODAY ABOUT ACES AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE WELL YEAH LET'S TALK ABOUT A FIFTH AND FOURTH GRADERS. AND LET'S NOT DO IT IN A WAY AND I THINK. THE COMPOUND IS NETWORK OF COLLEAGUES THE SAID IT WELL LET'S LET'S NOT PATHOLOGY BECAUSE THEM IN THIS NOT MAKE THEM NO PROBLEM. LET'S JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE KIND OF SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO BE ON A HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT THE TRACK AND I THINK THAT OUR LIFE COURSE FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY POINTS OUT. EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS. I SAID A MUCH I WAS UGH UGH -- COUNTY WILL FOR DIRECTOR -- AND I ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ALWAYS BEEN YOU CAN'T SERVICE PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. YOU GOT TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY. OPPORTUNITY IS THE HELIUM AND IN EVERYONE'S LIFE BELOW. RIGHT AND THAT'S ABOUT EDUCATION THAT'S ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK THAT'S ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT O ACTIVITIES THAT FOLKS ACTUALLY NEED I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY FOCUSED. ON MAKING SURE THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ALL AVAIL AVAILABLE FOR YOU FOR KIDS AS WELL. I HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT US ONE AT ONE END WITH JUST TWO THINGS. I WANT TO ALSO ENCOURAGE JUST AS DO WHAT WE WHAT WE SAY WE WILL ALWAYS DO WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD WELL UNSCREW ARGUMENT TODAY. AND THAT IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO PLACE BOYS AND YOUNG MEN A CALL OF THEMSELVES AT THE CENTER OF THE WORK THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN. THEIR VOICE THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEIR EXPERIENCE. IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR ABILITY TO BE EX A SUCCESSFUL GOING FORWARD. IS NOT A KIND OF HIP FUNKY COOL TRENDY THING TO DO IT IS A NECESSITY IT IS A REQUIREMENT FOR SUCCESS. AND WE BELIEVE WE GOT TO BE ABLE. TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. I AM A REALLY QUICK PERSONAL STORY BEFORE I AGAIN I MAKE MY EXIT TO GO PICK UP MY TWO YOUNG MEN MY FOURTEEN YEAR OLD. IN MY LIVING YEAR OLD WITH TEXTING ME LIKE CRAZY. ABOUT COMING TO GET THEM. I'M A MAN WHO WAS CLEARLY IN THE MIDDLE PART OF MY LIFE -- IN MANY YEARS AGO -- I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AT A REFORM SCHOOL IN NEW YORK CITY ON THE PRISON ISLAND KNOWN AS RYKER'S ISLAND WHICH WE HOPE TO CLOSE -- IN THE YEARS AHEAD. AS WELL -- WHAT WHAT I REALLY HOPE THAT COMES OUT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS? THIS IN A BETTER SENSE OF CONNECTION OR A BETTER ARTICULATION OF OUR COMMITMENT TO THIS WORK. IT REALLY IS THAT IN THE FUTURE THERE WILL BE NO STORIES LIKE SOME OF THOSE THAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY. THAT THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SYSTEM IS NOT SOMETHING WE WILL HAVE TALKED ABOUT. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL HAVE DONE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME HERE TODAY AGAIN PARDON ME FOR SCOOTING OUT. BUT I WILL GO HOME TO GET MY BOYS TAKE CARE BUSINESS BY THE THANK YOU. SO MUCH OUR NEXT A CENTER WILL BE -- SHANE MURPHY GOLDSMITH THE LIBERTY OF FOUNDATION HI. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SPENDING SO MANY HOURS WITH US I APPRECIATE YOU LASTING TILL THE VERY END AND SITTING THROUGH HOURS AND HOURS FAMILY. YOUR TIME AND I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY SCHEDULES -- SO YOU CHAMBER GOLDSMITH PRESENT CO LIBERTY HEALTH FOUNDATION I ALSO SERVE ON THE POLICE COMMISSION WHICH OVERSEES THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT I'M NOT SPEAKING AND I CAPACITY BUT A FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES ONLY -- SO LIBERTY HEALTH -- PROVIDES FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN LOS ANGELES THAT ARE FINDING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS BY ENGAGING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED AND SOLVING SOME OF OUR MOST INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND I'M ALSO OF THE PROUD CULTURE OF CALIFORNIA FUNDERS FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND BEEN WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND THAT'S A BEVERLY -- WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AND SO I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND HOW WE CAN TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA FROM BEING THE BIGGEST DEALER OF KIDS IN THE WORLD. TO BEING THE BIGGEST YOUTH DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM IN THE WORLD -- AND WANT TO SHARE THE STORY OF LOS ANGELES WHERE WE'VE CREATED A NUMBER OF MODEL PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT -- WE HOPE OTHERS CAN. LEARN FROM AND EXPAND -- SO YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT A LOS ANGELES PLANS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO INVEST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EACH OF THOUSANDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. IMAGINE THE THE NURTURING AND THE GROWTH THAT COULD HAPPEN BY INVESTING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS. BUT IN LA INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN NURTURING OUR KIDS ARE ACTUALLY GONNA INVEST SIDE AND INCARCERATING THEM THAT'S HOW MUCH WE'RE GONNA PAY PER YEAR TO INCARCERATE A KID. SO IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY KIDS IN JAIL YOU TONIGHT THAT'S A FEW THOUSAND A YEAR WE ARREST OVER TEN THOUSAND KIDS SO WERE ON THE WE ARE THE BIGGEST L. LA ITSELF IS THE BIGGEST DEALER IN VEGAS -- ARRESTING MARKETS IN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND 95% OF THE KIDS WHO ARE IN JAIL IN LOS ANGELES ARE BLACK AND BROWN BOYS. AND AS THE NUMBER OF KIDS IN JAIL LOS ANGELES HAS GONE DOWN OVER THE YEARS. OF THE PROPORTION OF THOSE KIDS WERE BLACK AND BROWN HAS GONE UP. SO RACIAL EQUITY BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE START TO TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM. AND MOST OF THE KIDS WERE ARRESTED INCARCERATED -- IN LOS ANGELES IN FACT 80% OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION SO THE STATE HAS HAS DECIDED THAT MINOR OFFENSES LIKE PETTY THEFT -- SCHOOLYARD FIGHTS TRUANCY THINGS LIKE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A DIVERSION AND THE LOS ANGELES DON'T NEED TO BE ARRESTED ACCORDING TO STATE LAW -- HAVE YOU VISITED DO YOU TH STEALTH. YEAH I HAVE I WAS THE PUBLIC DEFENDER FROM ELEVEN YEARS OR NOT SANTA CLARA COUNTY. SO YOU KNOW -- IN MY EXPERIENCE IN VISITING YOUTH JAILS IS THAT. JUST FINDING SUCH EXTRAORDINARY KIDS BRILLIANCE. OF POETS AND HILARIOUS STORY TELLERS AND HARD WORKING KIDS YOU JUST WANNA PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. KIDS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED AND BY EVERY SYSTEM THAT SET UP TO SUPPORT THEM. AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THESE KIDS IN THAT NO KIDS BELONG BEHIND BARS. SO THAT'S WHY WE LAUNCHED INITIATIVE AT LIBERTY HELL TO AND YOU CAN CONSERVATION AS WE KNOW IT AND BUILDING YOU DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM IN ITS PLACE. AND WE'RE GONNA USE A STRATEGY WE CALL SHRINK CLOSE IN INVEST SO WE WANT TO SHRINK THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ARRESTED -- BY 50% IN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS WE WANNA CLOSE THE NUMBER OF YOUTH JAILS -- BY HALF IN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND WE WANT TO BRING IN OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST A DO YOU DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM THAT WE'RE BUILDING I'M FROM SCRATCH. AND THIS IS ALL HAPPENING THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZERS MANY OF WHOM ARE IN THIS ROOM AT THIS TABLE WHOARE LEADING THE WAY. BRING IT TOGETHER OP PHILANTHROPY ELECTED OFFICIALS GOVERNMENT LEADERS THAT WITH UNDER THEIR VISION OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE DEVELOPED AND FIGHTING LIKE HELL FOR THIS VISION -- TO SHRINK CLOSE INVEST. SO WE HONOR THE CONSEQUENCE OF YOU THE RESTORATION OF VIRAL HERE I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM I CAN TELL YOU YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE MY LITTLE BROTHER WENT TO JAIL HE WAS A KID AND HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF JAIL AND HOMELESSNESS EVER SINCE. AND HE DESCRIBES THIS ENVIRONMENT OF A YOUTH JAIL LIKE IT'S LIKE AN MMA ARENA WERE LITERALLY THE KIDS ARE THERE TO TRAIN ON HOW TO FIGHT AND WIN. AND THE SKILLS THAT THEY LEARN QUITE ADEPTLY IN JUVENILE HALL AND YOUTH JAILS THIS THE SKILLS THAT THEY LEARN TO SURVIVE ARE THE SAME EXACT. SKILLS THAT WHEN THEY COME ON THE OUTSIDE CAN DESTROY THEIR LIVES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND I DON'T I JUST CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME FATHOM WHY WOULD BE PAYING ALL THIS MONEY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THAT FOR KIDS. YOU'VE HEARD TODAY WHAT KIND OF ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF A YOUTH DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM OR IF YOU DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT -- SO WE'LL GO THERE ALL THOSE BUT IT'S ALL BASED ON THE RESEARCH AND THE BRAIN SCIENCE THAT TELLS US THAT WHAT WE KNOW WHICH IS KIDS ARE DIFFERENT THAN ADULTS AND THEIR THE WAY THEY THINK ABOUT CONSEQUENCES THE AND ESPECIALLY LONG TERM. CONSEQUENCES THE RISK TAKING BEHAVIORS -- THE KINDS OF PRACTICES THAT CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE VERSES MAKE THEM FEEL SO ASHAMED THAT THEY CONTINUE TO BE SELF DESTRUCTIVE. THAT'S ALL IT REALLY CRITICAL IN DESIGNING PROGRAMS FOR KIDS AND WE KNOW THAT. THAT YOUTH JAILS DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THAT AND FOR THE MOST PART AND THAT THERE REALLY LEAVING OUR KIDS WORSE OFF THAN THEY FIND THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THESE PRACTICES WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE REALITY IS MOST OF THESE KIDS -- ID ARE ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSITY DON'T AB IN JAIL THEY DON'T NEED TO BE ARRESTED AND THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE IT OUT IN THE COMMUNITY ARE GOING TO HAVE THESE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES ARE TO BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AT SERVING OUR KIDS. AND IN FACT INSTEAD OF PAYING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO INCARCERATE OUR KIDS PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY THE PARTICULAR YOUTH DIVERSION IS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER KID. SO FOR FIVE THOUSAND BUCKS YOU SAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU THE KID IS WAY LESS LIKELY 2% OF A IT -- LESS LIKELY TO BECOME HOMELESS TO BECOME POOR -- TO TO FIND THEMSELVES IN OF UNSAFE SITUATIONS -- SO THE HEART OF OF THE OUR STRATEGY IS REALLY YOUTH DIVERSION WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY SO THAT'S A A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BASED PROGRAM WHERE KIDS ACTUALLY COME FACE TO FACE AND WHEN POSSIBLE WITH -- THE VICTIM IF THERE IS A VICTIM IN MOST CASES THERE IS NOT BUT IF THERE IS THEY'RE ABLE TO REALLY -- BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE AMENDS AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPING BRAINS -- TO INSTEAD OF JUST FEELING ASHAMED AND LIKE THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE AND THEY CAN NEVER DO BETTER AND THAT BECOMES A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY -- A REAL ACCOUNTABILITY ENABLES THEM TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY HARM THEY'VE DONE AND MAKE IT BETTER -- WHICH IS HEALING FOR THEM -- AND SO THESE DIVERSION PROGRAMS ARE ARE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL THE RECIDIVISM RATES ABOUT 11% WHEREAS IF THEY GO GET ARRESTED AND GO TO JAIL IT'S MORE LIKE YEARS AS A RESULT OF ALL THIS WORK WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND HOPE THAT IT LIKE I SAID IT CAN BE REPLICATED ELSEWHERE AGAIN AS A RESULT OF ORGANIZING BY YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION AND MANY OTHERS WHO ARE HERE. AND NOT HERE -- WE SEE THAT OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SUPPORTS HIS VISION THE HEAD OF THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT SAYS SHE DOESN'T WANT THESE KIDS IN JAIL THE CHIEF OF POLICE SO I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH SAYS HE DOES WANT TO BE ARRESTING THESE KIDS -- PHILANTHROPY IS LINING UP TO FUND THESE STRATEGIES -- AND AS A RESULT WE'VE SEEN -- SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED IN A YOUTH DIVERSION DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM THAT WE'RE CREATING IN LOS ANGELES THERE'S A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION LIBERTY HILL AND THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT TO DO CAPACITY BUILDING IN SUPPORT SO THAT GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS CAN. THAT THAT ARE WORKING COMMUNITIES WITH THESE KIDS ALREADY CAN SCALE UP AND GET GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO CREATE A YOUTH DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM AS A REAL ALTERNATIVE WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE OBAMA FOUNDATION WHICH CHAT TALKED ABOUT -- AND THAT COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH -- AND THEN OF COURSE THE YOUTH OF REINVESTMENT FUND THAT YOU ALL CREATED LAST YEAR HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS IS INVESTED -- THIRTY SEVEN MILLION IS ABOUT TO ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THE STATE AND PUTTING IN THE DISTRICTS OF MANY OF THE FOLKS ON THIS COULD -- COMMITTEE. AND HOPE IT GETS RENEWED IN YEARS TO COME -- AND THEN AND THEN SB FOUR THIRTY NINE WHICH IS MITCHELL'S BILL LAST YEAR THAT'S A BEING IMPLEMENTED IN LA COUNTY NOW THAT CREATES A MINIMUM AGE OF ARRESTING CARS ORATION OF ELEVEN SO THE KIDS ELEVEN UNDER CAN'T BE -- INCARCERATED WERE ACTUALLY WORKING ON THE SANDALS TO AND REYES THAT AGE -- ABOVE THAT IN FACT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS THE LARGEST IN THE NATION IS -- ABOUT. TO BREAK A DEAL WHERE THEY WILL STOP ARRESTING KIDS ON THEIR MIDDLE SCHOOL AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAMPUSES -- SO TRUMP TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUCCESS AND WOULD LOVE TO PARTNER WITH YOU TO TO DO THAT ALSO WHERE TO TAKE OUR LESSONS ELSEWHERE AND I WILL SAY THAT. FOR ME THE MOST AMAZING PART OF THIS WORK IS JUST THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE LEADING THIS WORK WHO HAVE BEEN IN JAIL HIS FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN IN JAIL AND OUR OVERCOMING TREMENDOUS -- OBSTACLES TO FIGHT TO OVERTURN THE SYSTEM -- AND WE CAN DO THIS WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS IT MIGHT SOUND -- AUDACIOUS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WERE REALLY ON THE PRECIPICE OF ENDINGS INCARCERATION AS WE KNOW IT IN LOS ANGELES IN CALIFORNIA AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT YOU TAKE AWAY FROM ALL THIS I WHAT I FROM MY REMARKS I WOULD SAY IS THAT. THE ONLY REASON THAT WE ARE RESTING THOUSANDS OF KIDS IN LOS ANGELES IS BECAUSE THE RESOURCES ARE NOT BEING INVESTED IN A COMMUNITY BASED DIVERSION PROGRAM THE DIVERSION PROGRAMS EXIST. I JUST NEED RESOURCES AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN LOS ANGELES AND THROUGH THE STATE. LEGISLATURE SO THAT THESE KIDS WON'T GET ARRESTED IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TERRY GRAMMAR. I AM THE FOUNDER OF NEW WORTH ORGANIZATION OUT OF LOS ANGELES -- JUST SITTING IN BACK OF THE ROOM -- A LITTLE OVERWHELMING. LISTENING TO EVERYONE. SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE HAVING IN OUR COMMUNITY ON THAT WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW. A LEGACY OF THAT OUR COMMUNITY FOR SO MANY. SO MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS -- I TRUST THAT -- IN THESE NEXT COMING YEARS TEN YEARS WE CAN REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT. A REALLY STRONG IMPACT ON ENDING YOU THINK CAR SERRATION -- IN IN TRANSFORMING IT ALL -- I AM HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT TRANSFORMING OUR JAILS. INTO COLLEGES. AND I BELIEVE IT'S TIME. NOT AT EVERY JAIL COULD BE TURNED INTO A COLLEGE BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE IN SOME PLACES THAT ARE RATE REALLY BEAUTIFUL. AND THAT'S TAXPAYERS PAY FOR THOSE PLACES AND DOM AND I THINK -- TAKING THOSE BACK IF THEY ARE CLOSING RIGHT NOW TAKING THOSE BACK AND PUTTING THOSE BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE AND TRANSFORMING THEM INTO VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS. IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO WE CAN'T REOPEN THEM AGAIN EVER. AND SO LAST YEAR IN COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT HOUSE JUVENILE OF THAT HOUSE A JUVENILE FACILITIES. MORE THAN 90% OF THE JAIL'S WERE LESS THAN HALF FULL. IN FACT ONE WAS ONLY AT 16% CAPACITY. THE ANNUAL COST OF INCARCERATING A YOUNG PERSON IN JUVENILE HALL IN CALIFORNIA HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. WITH BUDGET WITH JUVENILE HALLS AND KANSEN RANCHES DRASTICALLY UNDER UTILIZED THE COST TO INCARCERATE A YOUNG PERSON IS STILL RISING AND CONTINUES TO RISE. IN SOME COUNTY -- SPENDING MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOUNG PERSON TO BE A CAR INCARCERATED AND A LOT OF TIME THAT FOR STATUS OFFENSES STATUS OFFENSES ARE -- VIOLATION OF PROBATION. AND WE'RE PAYING THAT AS TAXPAYERS -- THROUGH THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE I'M OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. IN IN DETENTION FACILITIES PLACEMENT HOMES JUVENILE HALLS AS WELL AS A IN OUR OWN ARTS LEADERSHIP CENTER IN CULVER CITY WE'VE PROVEN THAT INVESTING IN YOUNG PEOPLE BY PROVIDING A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA PROGRAM. JOB TRAINING PLACEMENT FULL WRAP AROUND SERVICES ENABLES LASTING CHANGE IN THEIR LIVES. AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVES AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES -- IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE SERVE SIXTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE ACROSS THE LIVING CAMPS IN LA COUNTY. CURRENTLY THAT NUMBER HAD BEEN REDUCED THAT SHANE SAID EARLIER TO ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE IS IT'S IT'S REDUCED QUITE A BIT SINCE THEN AND THAT'S JUST IN EIGHT YEARS. SO WE CAN STILL WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THIS -- AND SO AS A RESPONSE AT AND AS A RESPONSE -- WE PARTNER WITH LA COUNTY AND WE'RE TRANSFORMING OF FOUR OF OF FORMER YOUTH CAMP RIGHT NOW INTO A VOLUNTARY RESIDENTIAL VOCATIONAL COLLEGE. AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME IT'S EVER BEEN DONE IN HISTORY. AND THE LOCATION THAT WAS ONCE THERE TO INCARCERATED YOUNG PERSON IS NOW BEING REPURPOSED INTO A COLLEGE CAMPUS. SERVING YOUNG MAN FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ON TRACK TO ADULT KERR SERRATION OR HOMELESSNESS. AND WE'RE DOING THIS OR OPERATING THIS WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS -- IN IT AND IT WILL BE FULLY FULLY OPERATED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. SO NOT ONLY WILL THIS SCHOOL HAVE BEEN NOT ONLY WITH A SCHOOL BE A HAVEN TO TRANSFORM LIVES -- FOR YOUNG MEN WHO DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE. DESERVE A THIRD CHANCE DESERVE SOMETIMES A FOR CHANCE. IT WILL BE IT WILL GIVE THEM A TANGIBLE CAREER TRAINING DENTAL CAREER TRAINING IN A GUARANTEED JOB PLACEMENT. IF YOU ASK AND HOW DO YOU GUARANTEE A JOB LONG RUN AROUND ALL OVER TOWN AND PUT TOGETHER AN EMPLOYMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THESE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE COMMITTED. TO WALK WITH US THROUGH THE JOURNEY OF THIS PROGRAM. AND NOT ONLY WILL THEY ADVISE US ON WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST UP TO UP TO DATE SKILLS YOUNG PEOPLE NEED THEY ALSO. HAVE PROMISED TO BRING SOMEONE ON OF THE PRINT IS PAID A PRINT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE. OF THE TRAINING ITSELF -- AND IT'S A SIX MONTH PROGRAM. SO -- I'M HERE TODAY TO SUGGEST THAT WE DO NOT STOP THERE. WHAT THE WHAT IF WE JUST DUPLICATED THIS MODEL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? OUR VISION FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO SEE THIS HAPPEN AT LEAST AT THREE MORE JUVENILE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TAKE THE VERY PLACE. TO TAKE THE VERY PLACES THAT ONCE INCARCERATED YOUNG PEOPLE. FLIP THEM LIKE PEOPLE FLIP THE TV'S I MEAN UNDER THE HOUSE ON TV RIGHT. INTO THESE BEAUTIFUL LOCATIONS THAT WILL BE REDESIGNED TO EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE. EACH FACILITY IS PROJECTED TO PROPERTY RIGHT NOW WE BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE DOING THIS ART THE FACILITY COSTS ABOUT ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TO OPERATE. WITH A ONE TIME COST OF A SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PER FACILITY TO RENOVATE WHOSE EXTRAORDINARY IMPORTANT THAT A YOUNG PERSON DID NOT WALK INSIDE ANOTHER PLACE THAT RE TRAUMATIZE. SO WE'VE GOT IT CAN'T GONZALEZ OUT WE'VE GOT IT -- DO YOU WON'T EVEN SEE ANY CINDER BLOCK ON ANY OF THE WALLS WHEN WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THAT. AND YOU'LL FEEL LIKE THOSE SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A MONTH YOU KNOW RETREAT SENATE CENTER FOLKS AVAILABLE GO TO YOU KNOW EVERY EVERY IF WE WANT TO FEEL LIKE -- A PLACE OF HEALING UPPING BROTHER JERRY TAIL SAID EARLIER YOU KNOW WE NEED WE NEED TO BE WE NEED HEALING INSTITUTIONS. AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER NOT EVERY PLACE CAN BE TRANSFORMED IN A WAY IT'S NOT FOR EVERY LOCATION. BUT CALIFORNIA'S GOT SOME BEAUTIFUL YOUTH PRISON I MEAN THEM TO THEM THANK YOU FOR THE BEAUTIFUL PLACES. AND PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME WILL YOU KNOW WHY NOT DO THE COMMUNITY WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS IN THE COMMUNITY. TO OF THIS WITHOUT TAKING AWAY ANYTHING ANY TO BE DONE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST LIKE A FOOT SOLDIER WAS ON THE BATTLEFIELD BECAUSE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS A LIKE BATTLEFIELDS. OVER POLICED WE GOT WAR ZONES AND THEY GO DOWN ON THE BATTLEFIELD YOU DON'T DO OPERATION ON THE BATTLEFIELD. YOU TAKE THEM OFF THE BATTLEFIELD SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN HEAL SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN BE REHYDRATED SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN REST. LOT OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TIGHT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD LOOKING SOMETIMES LOOKING LIKE AN OLDER THE OLDER THAN ME OKAY. AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF GRAY AND SO THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S THE NEED TO ALLOW OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO REJUVENATE. FROM THIS LEGACY OF OF OF PAINTING FROM OF THAT WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED I WISH I HAD WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I SPENT FIVE YEARS ON JUVENILE PROBATION -- AND IN WITH THE TEENAGE FATHER I DON'T HAVE ANY WOULD TURN TO SERVE MY WORK TODAY IT'S ALL ABOUT GIVING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE EXACTLY WHAT I WISH I HAD AT THAT TIME IN MY LIFE. AND SO -- SO WE PROPOSED. TO RUN THREE CONSECUTIVE. BUT THREE YOUR PILOTS OVER THE COURSE OF A TWELVE YEAR PERIOD EACH SIDE HAS. ONE YEAR PLANNING PERIOD BUILT IN. AND THEN OUR GOAL IS TO ONCE THAT PILOT IS COMPLETE EACH FACILITY HAS A FULLY SUSTAINABLE FUNDING MODEL THAT WILL ENSURE ITS SUCCESS FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. SO THAT THIS EQUATES TO ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE YEARS TO TRANSFORM THIS. SO -- SO WE'RE ALREADY DOING THIS WE ALREADY WERE ALREADY WORKING ON A PROOF OF CONCEPT A MODEL IN LOS ANGELES. THIS COULD BE REPLICATED AS WE HAVE BEEN REPURPOSE IN CAN'T GONZALEZ IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LA COUNTY OVER ALMOST THE LAST TWO YEARS. WELL WE ARE ALSO CURRENTLY SIX MONTHS AWAY FROM A FULL REMODEL. AND GRAND OPENING OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE CAREER INSTITUTE WHICH IS. CALLED THE FORMER CABINET SALAS. AND WITH APPROPRIATE FUNDING WE CAN FORM PARTNER CHAPTERS WE CAN THAT COMPRISE OF STRONG COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. IN THIS WAY WE CAN BENEFIT IN EMPOWER ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL LEADERS. WE WILL IDENTIFY THREE SITES PRIORITIZE. DO WITHOUT DETECTION CENTERS KANSEN RANCHES WITH UNDER 50% CAPACITY AND IN THOSE COUNTIES. IN IN THOSE COUNTY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT WAY IN SOME INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS. WITH THIS MODEL WE STABILIZE AND REBUILD OUR COMMUNITIES ADDING HIGHLY SKILLED TRADESPEOPLE AND PROFESSIONALS TO THE WORK FORCE OF THEIR TOWNS IN THERE BY. A MORE ECONOMIC STABILITY ACROSS THE STATE UTILIZING EMPTY BUILDINGS THAT NO LONGER SERVE A PURPOSE -- SO A HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS JUST A FRACTION OF THE COST. OF BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOUNG PERSON IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOUNG PERSON OVER TEN YEAR PERIOD THAT'S FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT ONE YOUNG PERSON. FOR ONE CHILD. SO WHILE CAN CALIFORNIA'S COUNTIES HAVE TAPPED INTO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STATE GRANTS TO BUILD AND EXPAND YOU IN A LOT DEL FACILITIES OVER THE PAST DECADE. THERE'S BEEN THERE'S BEEN NO SUCH FUNDING ALLOCATED TO CONVERT JAILS AND TO CENTERS TO UPLIFT EDUCATE. THROB PROPOSED THAT THERE'S A BETTER WAY AND IN EDUCATION AND RADICAL INNOVATION OVER INCARCERATION. IN IN IN IN SO DOING SO CREATING AN ECO SYSTEM INSIDE OF THIS PLACE SO. WE ENVISION THAT THE CONTROL THE THE THE THE TRAITS CAUGHT THE TRADE COURSE ISN'T IN PATHWAYS THE MENTORS AND TEACHERS BE PEOPLE FROM LIVED EXPERIENCES. AND IT'S AFFECTED PEOPLE AFFECTING PEOPLE TO AFFECT CHANGE A CALL. IN IN IN AND IN THE END OF THOSE THAT GO ON TO GRADUATE. FROM THE CONSTRUCTION COURSES GOING TO BUILD THE NEXT ONE SO THERE'S AUTOMATIC. HALFWAY INTO WORK. AND IF IN IN THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN THE ISSUE OF OF GETTING THEM INTO SOME OF THESE JOBS IN LOS ANGELES WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT THEY DON'T HAVE A PROPER PATHWAY INTO. CONSTRUCTION JOBS AND OTHER PATHWAYS THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD AN ECOSYSTEM IN WHICH THEY HAVE AUTOMATIC JOB TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- SO. WITH THAT SAID -- JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMMITMENT. TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND A A LOOK FOR TO WHAT WE DO IN THESE NEXT TEN YEARS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LIKE YOUR IDEA ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE IN. PRACTICE SOMETHING THAT WE ALL TAKE A LOOK AT BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR -- ADVISORY GROUP AND AND YOU KNOW TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER LOOKING AT SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST PROMINENT. CORPORATE INDUSTRIES -- TO PLAY A ROLE RIGHT WOULD BE THE TECH INDUSTRY OR OR WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT SO THANK YOU FOR A STIMULATING THAT THAT THAT THOUGHT AND THAT. TENSION IDEA TO PURSUE A WOMAN WANT TO THE NEXT SAYS SPEAKER -- THAT IS ANTHONY ROLL THIS WITH THE YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION SORRY. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING THEM AT THE WORLD IS THAT THE JUSTICE COALITION AND HOME BUT FOUND THIS CALIFORNIA. AND I WISH I WAS SPEAKING TO A MORE HOSTILE CROWD HOME BECAUSE I WANT TO SAY THAN PAYING. THAT -- I THINK -- PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING THAT ON IN THIS ROOM NEEDS TO HEAR -- BUT AS ONE OF THE START OFF ON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE VISION IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR -- AND IN CALIFORNIA AND BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF CALIFORNIA'S WAR -- AGAINST BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IN PEOPLE COLOR IN GENERAL -- AND I THINK THAT THE START WITH THE VERY BUILDING THAT WE'RE IN -- WE'RE COMING INTO THE ENTRANCE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING -- I NOTICED THERE WAS LIKE A OF A ENGRAVED ON THE WALL OF THIS BUILDING THERE'S LIKE A MURAL AND THERE IS LITTLE PANELS AN EXTENSIBLE PANEL THAT LIKE SCENES FROM CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND ONE OF THOSE SCENES THERE THE LOOKS LIKE A YOUNG NATIVE PERSON. BUILDING -- OF LIKE WELL LOOKS LIKE WALLING BRICKS TO A WALL IN FRONT OF A MISSION WHILE THE CATHOLIC PRIEST WATCHES OVER HIM AND THEN ANOTHER PANEL THERE'S A CATHOLIC PRIEST WELL A NATIVE. YEAH THE SECOND YOUNG NATIVE PERSON ON ON THEIR KNEES LIKE AN OMINOUS OBJECTIVE POSITION WHILE. A PRIEST OF GIVING HIM A BRANCHES SOMEDAY AND IT LOOKS LIKE OF THE OBVIOUSLY IT'S A POSITION OF DOMINANCE AND SUPERIORITY OVER THAT. AND THAT PERFECTLY EXPLAINS CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY -- THEN ON UNDER HERE YOU HAVE RONALD REAGAN STATUE AND HAVE COLUMBUS IS THAT YOU AND FRANKLY I THINK THIS WHOLE BUILDING NEED TO REACH A MAKE OVER I THINK ANY TO BE TORN DOWN. ON EVERY BILL INTO SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT REALLY -- CAPTIVATES OUR PEOPLE'S HISTORY -- IN OUR VALIANT AND WHEN WHAT WHAT ARE WHAT OUR FUTURE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN CALIFORNIA -- SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK ABOUT AMERICA'S INSATIABLE THIRST FOR WAR IT WAS PERFECT IT HERE AT HOME AGAINST NATIVE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE PEOPLE OF COLOR IN GENERAL -- CHINESE PEOPLE EVERYBODY THAT WAS IN WHITE ON THE WAR MACHINE WAS PERFECTED HERE AND TAKEN OVERSEAS AFTER -- AND JUST QUICKLY ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY ARMED AS SOON AS CALIFORNIA BECAME A STAY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE OF THE FIRST LAW THAT PASSED WAS AN ACT FOR THE GOVERNMENT PROTECTION OF INDIANS -- AND AN EIGHTEEN FIFTY AND THAT ALLOWED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE NATIVE YOU PUT HIM IN BOARDING SCHOOLS -- IT ALLOWED FOR THE EXTERMINATION IN THIS POSITION OF NATIVE PEOPLE THAN THERE WAS ON THE FOREIGN MINERS TAX OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE OF THE FIRST LAWS PASSED WHICH BEGAN THE WAR AND IMMIGRANTS HERE. WHICH DIDN'T ALLOW ANY FOREIGNERS INTO THE GOLD RUSH INTO THE MINING INDUSTRY SO. EVEN MEXICANS WERE CITIZENS OF OF CALIFORNIA AND UNDER THE AMERICAN RULE WHERE YOU'VE BEEN -- pAND WE WERE ECONOMICALLY SHUT OUT PEOPLE COLOR CHINESE PEOPLE -- WERE WERE CUT OUT OF THIS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMICALLY -- I GUESS CASTRATED FROM FROM FROM THE GOLD RUSH AND ALL THE RICHES THAT WILL COME FROM IT THEN THERE WAS THE GREASER ACT OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE WHICH AGREE THROUGH THE DOG FOR A TIME TO DESCRIBE MEXICANS -- IT WAS THAT DEBATE WITH THE VACANCY ACT WHICH CRIMINALIZED AND INCARCERATED NATIVE PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE BUT IT'S IN A COMPACT LABOR -- AND THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE AN ALLEY COUNTY WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND THE AND THE LA COUNTY JAIL THERE. WHICH CREATED A ON PRETTY MUCH A A STATE SYSTEM TO CONVICT LABOR -- SO THAT'S THE HISTORY OF OF THE SHORT BRIEF HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA THE ORIGINS AND THEN YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE SAND EIGHTEEN SIXTIES CALIFORNIA WITH THE CONFEDERATE STRONGHOLD I MEAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH THE CONFEDERATE STRONGHOLD OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY CREATED. AN ARM OF THE CONFEDERATE MELISSA CALLED ALI MOUNTED RIFLES INVOLVED IN THAT MONTH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT -- TO INSTALL A PRO CONFEDERATE PRO SLAVERY GOVERNMENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THEN AT THAT TIME WE HAD THE HIGHEST MENTION RATES IN IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. ARMED THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD FOR POLICE WAS ESTABLISHED DURING THAT TIME IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO ALL RIGHT AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. SO NOW WE PASSED FORDED TODAY WE'RE BARELY ADDRESSING THE FACT. THAT WE HAVE THE OLDEST AND MOST PERMISSIVE USE THE FOUR STANDARD IN THE COUNTRY AND WE WONDER WHY WE HAVE THE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES IN THE HIGHEST TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE DYING. pARM. SO I WANT TO JUST HONOR THOSE WHO REBELLED SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING ON GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WITH THE SAN GABRIEL REBELLION WHICH WAS ON LED IN PART BY ON BY PUTTING A WHO IS -- A NATIVE WOMAN WHO -- LETTER A VALIANT AGAINST THE THE THANK ABLE MISSION IN THE CATHOLICS THERE IN THE SPANIARDS THERE ON ALL THE WAY UP FOR TO THE WHAT FOR BOUND IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE SOUTH CENTRAL UPRISING IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND ALL THE OTHER BALANCE THAT CAN NAME. THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE GOTTEN US TO THIS POINT BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS. IS IS A REBEL AND EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS A HAS A HAS IS A SURVIVOR OF CALIFORNIA'S IN AMERICA'S WAR ON US ON A PEOPLE. AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE STILL HERE AND NOW WE'RE IN THIS BUILDING SAYING THIS TROOP IS A TESTAMENT TO ALL THE WORK THAT ANSWER THROUGH THE PUT IN AND NOW WE'RE PUTTING IN RIGHT NOW HOME. YEAH ME OF MY ME AND MY FAMILY ARE SURVIVORS. OF MY DAD WAS DEPORTED THREE TIMES OUT HERE AND NOT LIKE HE WAS CAUGHT AT THE BORDER AND DEPORTED A TO POINT. HE WAS THIRTY ONE YEARS OLD DON'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS THE PORTABLE AND HE WAS THE MAIN BREADWINNER FAMILY WITHOUT THE BEEN DEPORTED. AND THEN AFTER THAT WE ENDED UP HOMELESS MY BROTHER GOT LOCKED UP I WAS ARRESTED AT AT THE AGE OF TWELVE FOR THE FIRST TIME I WOULD GET LOCKED UP EVENTUALLY -- EVERY BIT ME MY BROTHER MY DAD ONLY THREE MEN AND ARE IN MY IN MY NUCLEAR FAMILY HAVE ALL BEEN LOCKED UP AND BEEN IN THE SYSTEM -- SINCE WE WERE CHILDREN SINCE WE WERE KIDS -- AND YOU KNOW WE WERE HOMELESS MY MOM WAS A SINGLE MOTHER US -- SAMMY EARLIER SAID THAT MOTHERS HAVE BEEN OUR GREATEST ALLIES THEY'VE BEEN OUR BETTER HAVE BEEN THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN HOLDING UP OUR COMMUNITIES WELL WE'VE BEEN -- DESTROYED BY THE SYSTEM AND DESTROYING OURSELVES -- SO LOT OF LOVE TO THE WOMEN IN OUR COMMUNITY -- SO. WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO NOW TALK ABOUT WHAT THE DIVISION. FOR FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS I GUESS -- AND AND JUSTIN KAPLAN ALL THE WORK THAT GOD IS HERE AND WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR THE FUTURE -- AND FIRST AND FOREMOST IF YOU WANT TO SHUT DOWN ALL YOU PRESENT. ON THOSE FOUR LEFT IN DJJ WOULD LIKE TO SHUT THOSE DOWN SOMETHING LIKE WITH NEW NEW WORK IS DOING ON TEN THOSE AN EDUCATIONAL CENTERS WE CAN BE DOING THAT -- AWAY WE COULD BE DOING THAT IN THE COMMUNITY -- JUST BE MORE OF IT AND ALL OVER THE PLACE -- ME TO SHIP THAT MONEY THAT'S BEING INVESTED THAT BEEN INVESTED INTO THE LARGEST PRISON SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY -- IN THE WORLD AND SHIP THAT IN SO YOU DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ALL MONEY THAT YOU'RE INVESTMENT FUND I'M ANY FUNDS THAT ARE MEANT FOR YOU FOR YOU FOR YOUTH YOUTH OF COLOR. SHOULDN'T BE GOING TO BE S. T. C. IT SHOULD BE GOING TO READ pDEPARTMENT BECAUSE IN. AN ALLEY -- COUNTY. HOME. WE FOUND THAT PROBATION BEEN TAKING ALL THE JJ CPA FUNDS TO DO THESE SCHOOL PROBATION PROGRAMS AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT AND SO WE DID A AUDIT. AND ONCE WE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT WE START ORGANIZING AND WE GOT ON TO THE JGTC THE LOCAL COUNCIL TO START TRYING TO SHIP BOTH FUND THE WAY WE ENDED VOLUNTARY PROBATION AND NOW THEY COUNTY -- WORKING WITH MR GIPSON AYE A. B. NINE A ONE TO INVOLUNTARY PROBATION ACROSS THE STATE -- BUT BOTH FUNDS ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS BEING USED FROM STATE FUNDS THAT'S FOR US FOR PREVENTION WOULD BEING USED FOR BOMB VOLUNTARY PROBATION IS SCHOOLS AN ALLEY COUNTY AND SO NOW. WE'VE WE'RE WE'RE ON THE J. J. GOT PEOPLE ON A DAY TO SEE SEE AND WE'RE RE DIRECTING THAT MONEY INTO YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND SO THAT MONEY EVENTUALLY WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR ANY TYPE OF SCHOOL PROBATION PROGRAMS ANYMORE -- BECAUSE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SPEAKING ABOUT FUNDING SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ON PROBATION THE BUDGET HAS DOUBLED. ON BY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO GET OVER BILLION DOLLARS AN ALLEY COUNTY ALLEY PT'S BUDGET IS INCREASED BY ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS OR AROUND THERE AND THE CHAIRS BUDGET HAS INCREASED ON THE SAME AMOUNT. OF THAT WAS DURING THE TIME WHEN THERE'S A GREAT RECESSION WHEN SERVICES ARE BEING CUT A LEFT AND AND A TIME WHEN CRIME WAIT FOR STARTING TO TO SLOW DOWN FOR THE RIGHT NOW AT HISTORIC LOWS ANOTHER COUNTY. BUT SOMEHOW THEIR THEIR BUDGETS HAVE BALLOONED AND DAVE TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO LIKE PROBATION FOR EXAMPLE INVOLUNTARY PROBATION JUST TO KEEP THE BUDGET TO GROW THE BUDGET TO KEEP THIS THAT -- WHEN WE DON'T NEED THAT AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT YOUTH WORKERS THE NOT ON SOCIAL WORKERS WERE YOUNG PEOPLE NEED IN SCHOOL OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE COMING BACK AND GIVING BACK AND DON'T HAVE A PUNITIVE MINDS THAT -- SO WE'RE TRYING TO RE APPROPRIATE ALTHOUGH FUNDS INTO YOUTH DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT LOCALLY AND AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL AND HOME WITH THE YOUTH COUNCIL AND EVERYTHING THAT THAT CAN RUN IT RUN THE SHOW AND AND BE IN CONTROL FOR THESE FUNDS ARE GOING AND HOW THEY MEAN ALLOCATED -- SECOND WE WOULD LIKE TO RE WRITE THE WET COLD ARM AND DECRIMINALIZE STATUS OFFENSES LIKE TRUANCY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. TO THOSE THE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM OUR WAY TO INTER MARRIED I'M IT'S FAR TOO EASY TO BE KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL AND SLIP INTO THE SYSTEM. ON A ONE OF THOSE REASONS BECAUSE SO MANY THINGS TO CRIMINALIZE THE ARM AND THINGS IN THE WORK WANT TO RE WRITE THE ENTIRE RECORDING JUST TO COME ALIVE THINGS FIND ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF DEALING WITH THE YOUTH ISSUES -- BECAUSE THE SYSTEM THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE THEM IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM EXACERBATE TRAUMAS AND ARE IN OUR ISSUES. ARM AND THEY JUST THEY JUST IT'S LIKE A NEVER ENDING CYCLE -- FLEET MUST BE SEPARATE AND CREATE A YOUTH DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM -- WOULD ALSO LIKE TO INCLUDE THE DEFINITION OF YOUTH UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE AT HOME IN ACCORDANCE WITH SCIENCE. ON LIKE THE END AL WHAT LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR EVERYBODY. AND THEN WE WANT TO END THE WAR ON GANGS AND GANG ENHANCEMENTS AND AND GETTING DATABASES AND GANG INJUNCTIONS AND GETTING REGISTRATIONS. CUT OFF ALL FED ACCESS TO GAIN DATABASES THAT EVEN THOUGH WE CUT OFF ACCESS IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT -- WE COULDN'T CAUGHT THAT AXIS SO. I CAN STILL GET THERE. GET PEOPLE THE INFORMATION TO THE A TF EFFORT TO THE DHS IT'S HOME IT HEALTH AGENCY -- SO WE'D LIKE TO CUT OFF ALL BUT ACCESS -- TO TO TO AVOID THAT AND AND AND AND INCRIMINATION AND STOP THE CREATION OF NEW DATA BASES THAT ARE INFORMED BY THIS GANG DATABASE LIKE IN LA WE HAVE. ON THE CHRONIC OFFENDER BULLETS AND ANOTHER GONNA AND PREDICTIVE POLICING BUT MOVE ON TO THE PRECISION POLICING WHICH TO DOING IN NEW YORK WHICH IS LIKE. LIKE TARGETED FOR GANGS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IN NEW YORK WITH THE BRONX EIGHTY SOMETHING THEY ARRESTED LIKE. ALMOST A HUNDRED PEOPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- OF A ON A RICO CASE AND MOST OF THEM WEREN'T EVEN IN A GANG OR NOTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING NOW THEY ARE THAT'S WHAT I HEARD AS I READ ABOUT -- AND ALSO WE'D LIKE -- TO LIKE TO END THE ONE GAME WHICH IS THE ONE PEOPLE COLOR AND ALSO ON AVOID CAPITALISTIC SOLUTIONS ON OF SUCH AS LIKE THE FIRST STEP BACKWARD THE GEO GROUP. IS GONNA GET HUGE OPPORTUNITIES BIGGER OPPORTUNITIES TO RUN ON REENTRY AN ELECTRONIC MONITORING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE. GOING TO BE COMING OUT OF PRISON BUT AGAIN GOT ELECTRONIC MONITORING I'M GOING TO RE ENTRY PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUN BY PRIVATE CORPORATIONS LIKE GEO AND WE ALL KNOW THE COLE BROTHERS AND ALL THAT WERE BEHIND FIRST STEP BACK IN. IN LOVE WITH IT -- ALSO -- UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE THAT INCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE YOUNG PEOPLE PEOPLE WITHOUT -- DOCUMENTS SHOULD ALL HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. AND THEN DO A SURVEY OF THE UNUSED AND MISMANAGED PUBLIC SPACE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THAT WE CAN TRANSFORM INTO YOUTH CENTERS EDUCATIONAL CENTERS AFFORDABLE HOUSING THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE AND NOW THEY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH. NEW WORDS AND ON CAMPUS ALL IS AND THEN WHAT WE DID IT ON WE TOOK OVER ON THE DAVID CAN YOU DO NOW COURTHOUSE FORMER JUVENILE COURT HAS THAT THAT HAD. HOLDING TANKS IN THAT WE TURN IT INTO A SCHOOL FINANCIAL COMMUNITY CENTER A YOUTH CENTER. ON WE CAN DO THAT ALL OVER THE STATE HOME BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH PUBLIC SPACE THAT EITHER BEING MIS MANAGER THAN BEING USED AT ALL IT CAN BE USED FOR A LOT OF GOOD THINGS -- AND YEAH I THINK THAT'S SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ENVISIONED FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS ON THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK. AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY THAT SPOKE BEFORE ME AND EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM THAT IS HELP THIS GET TO THIS POINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR DROPPING SOME GOOD HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE. ON ALL OF US. VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. ABBAS A THE ONE SALAS WITH THE CáC SPEND ANY PROGRAMS THAT COULD HAVE A LEADER BY SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT [inaudible] THANK YOU. UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT THAT WELL VERSED IN HISTORY SO. SO GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OF CNN AND THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE. AND OF COURSE ALL MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES IN THE YOUTH THAT ARE HERE TODAY SO I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK. YOU HERE TODAY WHO TAKEN THE TIME TO HOLD SPACE FOR ALL THOSE WHO WE SERVE AND WE REPRESENT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR THE PROPERTY SEVEN FOR VALUE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND ADVOCATES IN PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES AND A PATH FOR OUR YOUTH AND ADULTS TO EAL. FOR THE NEXT SEVEN GENERATIONS. I CURRENTLY OVERSEE THE PROP FORTY SEVEN LCS IS P. GRANT FOR COACHELLA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS. THE OFFICE OF CHILD WELFARE IN ATTENDANCE AS AN ACTIVE PARTNER IN THE WORK THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING. HER PARTNERS IN THE JOURNEY WITH THE GRANT ARE THE NATIONAL COMBAT IS NETWORK AND NATIONALLY KNOWN AND WELL RECOGNIZED ORGANIZATION THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE INTRODUCED THE FOUR CORE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORK OF THE COMBAT IS NETWORK. THOSE FOUR PRINCIPLES THAT PROMOTE CULTURALLY BASED TEACHINGS AND TRANSFORMATIONAL LEARNING ARE. EVERYONE SHOULD FEEL WANTED WELCOME AND IS A BLESSING. ALL LIFE HAS A POSITIVE PURPOSE ALL HAVE CULTURALLY BASED TEACHINGS TO GUIDE US. ALL SHOULD HAVE SAVE COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE AROUND THEM AND SECURE PLACESTO LEARN AND HE'LL AND TO DEMONSTRATE LOVE. THESE VALUES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO OUR STUDENTS ADMINISTRATION TEACHERS AND SUPPORT STAFF. THIS IS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUCH AS LIKE WILL DIRECT VOTER. WHICH EMPLOYS MULTI GENERATIONAL PROCESS OF LEARNING AND REMEMBERING ONCE TRUE ON POSITIVE CULTURE VALLEY'S PRINCIPLES CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS. THIS INCLUDES PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND HEALING AND TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY BASED PRACTICES. THIS WILL HELP US IN CREATING A POSITIVE INEQUITABLE SCHOOL CLIMATE. ALSO PROVIDED OUR TRAININGS IN THE RIGHT TO PASSAGE PROGRAMS SUCH AS A HOLDEN OVERLAY AND CHEN NATURALLY. THEIR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR YOUTH BASED ON INDIGENOUS TEACHINGS. THOSE TEACHINGS INCLUDE YOUTH LEADERSHIP AND DEVELOPMENT OF IDENTITY. IT ALSO ADDRESSES PHYSICAL ABUSE SUBSTANCE USE GANG VIOLENCE ACADEMIC CHALLENGES AND PROMOTES HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE ALSO BEEN INTEGRATED INTO OUR EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS. OTHER TRAININGS -- AS WELL THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDED FOR STAFF OUR CIRCLE KEEPERS AND SELF CARE. SO THIS LEADS ME INTO OUR VISION FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. FUNDING WILL BE KEY TO CONTINUE THIS WORK WHICH WILL HELP TRANSFORM THE PAIN. AND THEN JUSTICE CENTER COMMUNITY SOME OF THE ISSUES WE FACE ARE INCREASED PROBLEM. SUICIDE BORDER ISSUES FEAR SUBSTANCE USE VIOLENCE SEX TRAFFICKING LACK OF ACCESS TO MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND OTHER LIMITED RESOURCES JUST TO NAME A FEW. THE CURRENT DATA FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE DATA COLLECTED BY A DOCTORATE EVENT THIS GOT ME AT AND TANYA READ A FROM THE COMBINED IS NETWORK. SO THAT THE MIND SET OF TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATION IS SHIFTING FROM A PUNITIVE AND BIAS MIND SET TO ONE OF UNDERSTANDING THE CORE INDIGENOUS PRINCIPLES. THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND HOW IT APPLIES ON A DAILY BASIS. MY FOLLOWING STATISTICS SHOW THAT WE ARE PROGRESSING IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH OUR CURRENT PARTNER. WE HAD ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE SUSPENSIONS IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN COMPARED 210-004-0030 SEVEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE AND THIS PAST SCHOOL YEAR. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO THERE'S DEFINITELY A DECREASE THERE ARE EXPULSIONS WERE SEVENTEEN AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ELEVEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND SEVEN IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ALSO PROGRESS. OUR OUR CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM ALSO HAS -- DECREASED WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THERE AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WORKING ON OUR SCHOOL CLIMB IT WILL DEFINITELY HELP US AND IN THAT AREA. SO WE NEED TO FUND OUR SCHOOLS -- DIRECTLY TO CONTINUE OUR CAPACITY BUILDING WITH ADMINISTRATORS COUNSELORS. TEACHERS SUPPORT STAFF STUDENTS AND PARENTS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS WE NEED TO PROVIDE SYSTEMS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE PERSONAL WELL BEING. AS WELL AS OUR OPPORTUNITIES FOR AN EQUITABLE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND BEYOND. THE JOURNEY HAS JUST BEGUN AND I DO RECOMMEND ALLOCATING FUNDING FOR A TEN YEAR EFFORT TO CHANGE THE CURRENT NARRATIVE. FUNDING SCHOOLS DIRECTLY WOULD INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO CONTINUE THIS WORK. AND ADDRESS THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS. CV UST ALSO PLANS AND INTEGRATING THIS WORK -- INTO HEAD START IN ORDER TO BUILD A PATH OF CONTINUITY THROUGHOUT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THAT THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF OUR CHILDREN OUR FUTURE WARRIORS. AND ALL THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO SEEK SPACE TO HEAL AND GROW. AS ARE MY AND ANCESTORS BELIEVED WE WERE ALL CONNECTED. AND LIKE GETS YOU ARE MY OTHER ME. WHEN YOU HEARD? WE ALL HEARD. WHEN YOU STRUGGLE? WE ALL STRUGGLE. BUT WHEN YOU HEAL WE ALL HEAL. WHEN YOU GROW WE ALL GROW? WHEN YOU LEARN? WE ALL LEARN. WHEN YOU SUCCEED WE ALL SUCCEED? YOU ARE ME. I AM YOU AND WE ARE. ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO ALL THE PANELISTS AND OPEN IT UP FOR SOME QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SOME MEMBER GIPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ONE APOLOGIZE I'VE BEEN RUNNING IN AND OUT -- BUT I BEGIN DEMONSTRATES MY COMMITMENT -- TO BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I WANT TO SAY FOR THOSE WHO TESTIFIED -- WHILE I WAS HERE I THINK YOU ARTICULATED YOUR MESSAGE YOUR COAT YOUR PASSION -- YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES -- SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT AS HIS BROTHER'S DEMONSTRATE IT HAS BEEN ROUTED IN VERY FABRIC OF CALIFORNIA NOT THINK AT THE TIME THAT A PARADIGM SHIFT TAKES PLACE NOT THINK IT BEGINS RIGHT HERE BEGINS WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. WHO MADE A COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE THE CHANGE -- THE CULTURE IN CALIFORNIA NOW WHEN A PLOT EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE -- I STAND WILLING READY AND ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING TO MAKE -- THESE KINDS OF CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA SO GET THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS A MEMBER. THIS CALL. BUT HE WAS SURE ARE ALSO WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THE INPUT AND ADDS A COUPLE THOUGHTS -- ONE MISTER HEWITT WAS SAYING I THINK THAT IN DIFFERENT WAYS YOU ALL -- KIND OF THE SAME THING WE HAVE TO WORK WITH YOUNGER AND YOUNGER YOUTH AND AND WORK UPSTREAM. EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD BABIES AND AND LEAD YOUNG. A YOUNG CHILDREN I MEAN WE DO HAVE THIS EMPHASIS WITH ORG GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WHAT HAVE YOU AND AGAIN. UP WITH A LOT OF MONEY BEING THAT'S GONNA BE INVESTED IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE MONEY IS HOW THE MONEY IS BEING USED -- AND SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT AT LEAST ONE A PLACE WERE WE ARE THINKING ABOUT -- ABOUT BABIES ABOUT YOUR NEW PARENTS ABOUT A YOUNGSTERS BEFORE THEY EVER ENTER SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHERE YOU HAVE TO START AND SO THAT'S ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS INVESTMENT IN THOSE A GREAT POINT THAT WAS MADE -- AND IN TERMS OF A ROOM YEAH MR GRAMM OF THE WORKING DOING I THINK THAT IT'S AN WAS TRANSFORMATIONAL BUT IS ALSO TAKES A VERY NEW WAY OF THINKING RIGHT AND AS TO THE CHAIRS POINT IN TERMS OF THE TECH INDUSTRY IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. I THINK ONE THING TO IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY YOU MAY ALREADY BE DOING THIS -- THIS LOOK AT THE BOOT CAMPS THIS THE CODING -- WILL BOOT CAMPS THAT LAST YEAR FOR THREE TO SIX MONTHS -- AND CAN GET YOU A SIX DIGIT JOB WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THEM AND I THINK THAT ESPECIALLY IF YOU PARTNER WITH SOME OF THESE -- BUT THE COMPANY IS -- THAT YOU COULD YOU DO THE INTEL APPROVED APPROVED -- CODING BOOT CAMPS WHAT HAVE YOU AND I'VE SEEN NO PEOPLE IS TALKING ABOUT HIS HOUSE THAT I'VE GONE TO THOSE THAT WHICH TOTALLY CHANGED CAREERS. AN OUR OUR OUR IN LUCRATIVE CAREERS IN THE TECH INDUSTRY BUT THE THE WAY YOU'RE SETTING IT UP IT SEEMS KIND OF A NICE MATCH -- TO HAVE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT -- THE MADE REFERENCE TO BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING -- HAVING SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN -- IN JAILS AND IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY I THINK CERTAINLY -- TRANSFORMING THEM INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE AND HEALING BECAUSE YOU TO IMPRISON A REALLY TWO THINGS I SHOULDN'T BE. TOGETHER -- AND SO -- I I THINK THAT ALL OF YOU SPOKE TO THE TO THAT OF HOW WE MEMBER AND THAT CONSTRUCT -- AND AS MS ROBBINS WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW KIND OF HOW. NUMBER BARELY ADDRESSING -- TALK ABOUT USE OF FORCE IN AFTER A HUNDRED YEARS WHICH IT WAS A LOT OF THINGS OUR BELLIES ORINDA DRESSED HOUSE A STATE -- AND I'M GLAD WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE SOME OTHER STATES ON EVEN THERE YET ARE FAR OFF. AND SO I DO I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY THERE'S A SPIN OFF FROM THIS SELECT COMMITTEE ARE FORMER CHAIR -- STARTED -- IT'S LIKE ME TO AND THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT'LL WORK REALLY NICELY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY. HAVING -- FORMER CHAIR JONES SAWYER -- CHEERING THAT COMMITTEE SO I THINK A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- CAN YOU CAN BUILD UPON OF ALL A LOT OF WHAT WAS -- MENTION TODAY OF FROM OUR FROM OUR ESTEEMED PANELISTS -- AND AND THE THE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW OPEN AND I'M. BECAUSE I THINK -- MISTER HEWITT MADE MENTION OF THIS AS WELL THAT. THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS HE REFERRED TO AS RED COUNTIES IS BLUE COUNTIES BAKER WOULD. CONVERT IT POLITICAL TERMS ARE JUST MORE CONSERVATIVE VERSUS MORE LIBERAL -- BEING IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY OR IF YOU'RE IN LA COUNTY ALAMEDA COUNTY SAM CISCO WHAT HAVE YOU YOU HAVE SUPPORT OF BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS. YOU HAVE -- OF SHARES OR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS THAT ARE GONNA BE TEND TO BE MORE SUPPORTIVE MAYBE NOT ALWAYS BUT THERE TEN DEAD TO BE SUPPORTIVE AND SO BUT YOU HAVE MATCHING GRANT PROGRAMS. OR YOU HAVE THESE INVESTMENTS YOU KNOW I HAVE MY BOARDS BY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THAT THEY'RE LOOKING KNOW THEY'VE ALREADY. ARE ARE MOVING GO THERE THE IN THESE COUNTIES SHUT DOWN JUVENILE HALL AND AND AND AND HOW TO BE. A GUEST OF OPEN QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THESE MORE CONSERVATIVE COUNTY IS THAT MAYBE DON'T HAVE SUPPORT OF SHARES OR BOARD SUPERVISORS OR DISAGREE ATTORNEYS BUT WE KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU ARE ON THE GROUND THERE. DOING THE WORK HOW DO WE SUPPORT YOUR WORK WITHOUT THE POLITICAL SUPPORT. AT THOSE LOCAL LEVELS UNTIL WE CAN CHANGE ALL THOSE POLITICIANS ARE HOW DO HOW DO WE GET. THE RESOURCES INTO THOSE COUNTIES BECAUSE I'D NOW IS A VERY FAIR POINT. THAT A LOT OF THE MONEY IS GOING INTO THE COUNTIES THAT ALREADY HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY WHAT COMES FIRST. AND SO I I THINK THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION TO THINK ABOUT AS REPORTING MORE MORE MONEY -- IN INTO THESE VERY WORTHY PROGRAMS A LOT OF YOU A LOT OF THOSE THAT ARE THAT SPOKE ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL WORKING ON HOW DO WE HOW DO WE AYE IF WE DON'T WE CAN'T CHANGE THE MINDS AND HEARTS. OF THOSE ELECTED LEADERS THAT HAVE CONTROL OVER THOSE PURSE STRINGS HOW CAN HELP ME FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STILL GET THOSE PROGRAMS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. EVEN IF THOSE POLITICIANS AT THE SMALL DAY IN TIME ARE NECESSARY SUPPORTING THEM SO THAT'S AGAIN OPEN QUESTION FOR US TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY SUPPLY CAME TO MIND. WHEN CHAD AND MENTION THAT? GOOD QUESTIONS WITH ANYONE LIKE TO TAKE A SHOT AT I WAS JUST GONNA -- SAY THAT I KNOW THAT THAT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT YOU KNOW THING TO TACKLE BUT I THINK ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS IS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT DISTRIBUTING FUNDING OUR GRANTS OR ANYTHING. IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL. AND HAVE THE TRACK RECORD AND HAVE PROVEN THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY UTILIZING. THEN WILL IMPACT THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK. THAT NEEDS TO START THERE. BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WE COULD HAVE JUST FOCUSED ON THE U.. AND THAT'S GOOD RIGHT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR YOUTH AND GROW THEM BUT IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AS MUCH LIKE A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. YOU KNOW THERE'S THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL SO THIS IS WHY THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK WITH THE WITH THE NATIONAL BY DOESN'T WORK AS TO YOU KNOW NOT NOT ONLY ARE WE HERE WITH THE STUDENTS BUT WE HEAR WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AN IN HOUSE TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE. SOMEWHERE. IN A AND AND I KNOW THAT'S DIFFICULT TO DO IN IT AND I KNOW I'M READING THIS AND YOU'RE THINKING WOW. BUT IT WASN'T THAT EASY THE FIRST YEAR NOBODY WOULD LIKE WHAT IS IS WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WANT ME TO TOUCH AND FEEL MY HEART LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. YOU KNOW BUT BUT OVER TIME YOU KNOW WHEN THEY STARTED IN A TO INTERNALIZES AND SEE THE WORK THAT IS GOING ON IN THE AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH THE INSANE THAT. THE PUSH THAT IS YOU KNOW COMING FROM FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE ASSEMBLY IS HELPING. BECAUSE IN THERE YOU KNOW EVEN IF PEOPLE JUST DO IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE CURRENT NARRATIVE THAT'S OKAY. IT THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE THAT PATHWAY FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN EITHER JUMP BONNER YOU KNOW. JUMP UP AND NOT BUT BE QUIET NOT CAUSE ANY MORE PROBLEMS AND THAT'S IT YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME THAT I THINK WE CAN HOPE. FOR IS THAT THOSE WHO ARE PASSIONATE AND WHO ARE REALLY VESTED IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING ARE GOING TO AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT AND CAN JUST. YOU KNOW TAKE A STEP BACK AND THAT'S OKAY WELL LEVEL MANY WAY FROM AFAR YEAH WELL AS I GUESS IS YOUR BUILDING THE MOMENTUM FROM THE GROUND UP. THE GRASSROOTS. THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE AND JUST SQUEEZE ABOUT THE CAN EITHER GUILT. JOINT OR STEP ASIDE [inaudible] THANK -- YEAH I JUST WANTED TO ADD I THINK. I THINK YOU YOU HAD EXACTLY ON THE HEAD AND ARM I THINK A WAY FOR US TO TO TANGIBLY DO THAT THE VERY LEAST THIS THIS BODY THIS LEGISLATURE CAN DO THAT IS BY CREATING YOUTH DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WE'RE ALL YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR YOUTH SERVICES UNDER THAT DEPARTMENT -- AND IT'LL BE TOO ENTICING BILLS CONSERVE COUNTY THIS TO MISS OUT ON OUT ON THESE FUNDS OF THESE MONEY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THEN SECONDLY -- I THINK BRINGING BACK SB FORTY THREE I BELIEVE WAS THE NUMBER BY MINING WHICH WOULD HAVE CREATED A PILOT PROGRAM -- PILOT FUNDS FOR FIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT APARTMENTS IN FIVE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT WOULD APPLY. ARM IT WAS KILLED I THINK THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE CONSIDER COUNTIES THE LOT OF POWER IN PROBATION STUDS A LOT OF POWER TO SEND SEEN. THAT -- THAT THAT THE STRONGHOLD THAT THEY HAVE OVER CALIFORNIA'S. THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG PEOPLE COMING TO AN END -- BUT I THINK IF WE CAN BRING THAT BACK WE CAN SLOWLY START BUILDING. ON AND AND CREATING DEVELOPMENT ALL BECAUSE STATE. THANK YOU. I'VE GOT A QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO OUR SCHOOL CLIMB IT. AND ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW WE'VE GIVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISCRETION UTILIZING LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULAS. WHAT COULD WE DO MORE TO ADD MAYBE THE WORD IS INCENTIVIZE SCHOOL DISTRICTS? TO UTILIZE IN PRIORITIZE SOME OF THESE RESOURCES -- TO IMPLEMENT YOU KNOW WHY THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- CERTAINLY A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE SCHOOL -- BUT OUTSIDE. LOVE TO HEAR WHAT -- WHAT COULD WE DO? IN THE LA BECAUSE THE SCHOOL CLIMATE BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH WAS FOUGHT FOR BY FOLKS IN THIS ROOM AND OTHERS BE REDUCE SUSPENSIONS BY OVER 70% BY ELIMINATING WILLFUL DEFIANCE IS A REASON FOR SUSPENSION BUT THAT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO AN EX EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS BUT WE FOR LEARNED RECENTLY. IS THAT -- ARRESTS OF KIDS ON THOSE CAMPUSES IS GOING UP AS OF THE ORIGINAL VISION WAS THAT RESOURCES FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ANOTHER SERVICES WERE SUPPOSED TO REPLACE THE NEED FOR SUSPENSION. AND IT WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND WE'VE SEEN SOME OTHER PROGRAMS WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY THAT THAT PART DOESN'T HAPPEN SOMETIMES A REFORM HAPPENS WITHOUT THE SERVICES AND I THINK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WE JUST REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE AND WHAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY IS. A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF UNITY AROUND LIKE WILL NEVER MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN AND LET'S MAKE SURE THE RESOURCES ARE THERE. SO I THINK YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THE RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY ALLOCATED IN SCHOOLS FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND FOR REAL ALTERNATIVES TO SUSPENSION WHICH INCLUDES TEACHER TRAINING BUT ALSO SPECIFIC SERVICES FOR KIDS. AND ALSO THERE'S A REAL OVER RELIANCE ON SCHOOL POLICE AND SOME OF THESE -- SCHOOLS AND SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK YOU KNOW. SCHOOLS AND KIDS ARE LOOKING FOR CARING ADULTS AND SCHOOL POLICE. IF THAT'S THE SOURCE OF CARING ADULTS ARE SOME REALLY SERIOUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO THAT SO I WOULD LOOK AT THAT AS WELL. ELSE WANT TO GIVE TO A SHELTER QUESTION. OKAY. I WANNA ALSO WHAT DOES ONE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE -- HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HERE TODAY? AND I WHAT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THEY'RE HERE TODAY THEY'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WE CAN'T FORGET THEIR STORIES BECAUSE THEIR STORIES ARE WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE. TO IS WHAT'S GONNA MAKE THE REAL IMPACT IN. TALKING ABOUT US MOVING INTO OTHER COUNTIES WHETHER YOU'RE OF MORE OF A RED COUNTY I THINK WE WE NEED TO DEFINITELY INVEST MORE IN YOUTH ORGANIZING -- AROUND THESE ISSUES AND AND AND HELP THEM TO MAKE IMPACT -- MORE SO THAN ALL OF THE OLD FOLKS -- ME I'M ON THEM TO ABOUT ME -- INCENTIVIZING INCENTIVIZING SCHOOL PROGRAMS IS THAT WHAT THE QUESTION YEAH I'M LOOKING AT THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE GIVING I MEAN EVERY YEAR WE TELL THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. THERE WERE INCREASING FUNDING TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS K. TO TWELVE SYSTEM RIGHT AND THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA INVEST MORE IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN. EDUCATION -- SAYING WILL THAT'S GREAT AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER YOU KNOW STANDARDS AND CURRICULUMS THAT NEED TO BE TIGHTENED ADOPTED. COMPLETED BUT WERE ALSO SEEN TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CHALLENGES WITH OUR SCHOOL CLIMATE IN THE IMPACT IT'S HAVING. ON DRAMATIZATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE SO SHOULD THERE BE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE DOING LEGISLATIVELY. TO CONDITION THE ACCEPTANCE OF THESE DOLLARS TO GOAL TOWARDS THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND AND IF SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. I DON'T HAVE ANY. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER EITHER REALLY COULD NOT. IN THE ORGANIZING YEAH TAKE THE PRESSURE. GREAT THE PRESSURE ON MY ON THE LOCAL AREA -- BUT THE FUNDING YOUTH ORGANIZING I LIKE THAT IDEA BECAUSE I THINK ON WITH THE KIND OF CENTER BY THE SCHOOLS WE CAN WE CAN. SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ORGANIZING AT THEIR SCHOOLS TO TO GET THESE PROGRAMS DONE LOCALLY. SO I WANTED TO SPEAK -- REAL QUICK AS FAR AS A RESOURCE OFFICERS SO -- OUR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT A TO THEM ACTUALLY DISMISSED. ALL OF THE RESOURCE OFFICERS FROM OUR CAMPUS THIS PAST SCHOOL YEAR. SO SHUT UP TO TO OUR BOARD MEMBERS AND I KNOW WE HAVE ONE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE LEFT EARLY -- AND THE REASON THAT ONE NUMBER ONE AND ALL THAT I'M OUR BOARD MEMBERS ARE ARE PROGRESSIVE. AND I KNOW THAT -- MANY OF THEM DO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE WORK -- THAT IS BEING DONE AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO TO DO THAT NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS NOT AND YOU KNOW GOOD USE OF RESOURCES FOR SURE -- BUT ALSO BECAUSE WITH THE LC FF DOLLARS. HEALTHY A FIFTY DOLLARS. BEEN A LONG DAY -- THEY ARE FUNDING AS SO THERE'S A MOVEMENT TO INTEGRATE P. B. I. S. AND HAS BEEN FUNDED FOR COUPLE YEARS NINE OR SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO ALL THE SCHOOLS -- WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR TO HAVE TO BE -- PBS COMPLIANT JUST ACCORDING. TO TO THAT -- TRAINING -- THERE IS SOME FUNDING THAT IS GOING TOWARDS -- SOME OF THE RJ PROGRAMS. AND THEN WE YOU KNOW OF COURSE WE HAVE THIS GRANT SO I THINK CONTINUING TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THESE. BECAUSE I'M YOU KNOW WORKING AND I'VE BEEN IN THE WORK IN FRISCO THIS YEAR FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS. SO YOU KNOW LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE SYSTEMIC LIKE A LOT OF OTHER SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE. AND I THINK HAD THIS GRANT NOT COMMAND AND THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE -- WITH THE WITH THE COMBAT IS NETWORK. THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO KEY IN ON A CLUE NO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IS HOW IS THIS CUTE OR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND I AND I SEE THAT -- ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS AND THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT AND IS IT WAS A CHALLENGE FOR US IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. IS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STILL THEIR MIND SAID EVEN THOUGH THEY DO CARE. THEIR MINDSET IS STILL TEST COURSE. TEST COURSE OF COURSE OF COURSE. I DON'T CARE IF THE KID IS HUNGRY I DON'T CARE IF THE KID IN SEE PLUS MY I DON'T CARE IF THE KIDS YOU KNOW PARENTS WERE DEPORTED AND NOW HE HAD TO STAY WITH A NEIGHBOR. SO THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF FOCUS ON THAT AND EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE. MEASURES THE THE SUCCESS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BY WHAT THEY CALL NOW WITH THE DASHBOARD. WELL THAT DASHBOARD IS ALL ACADEMIC. IT MEASURES THE ACADEMICS. IT'S MEASURING -- ATTENDANCE BUT IT'S NOT MEASURE IN ANY OF THE SOCIAL INDICATORS. SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST FIGHTS THAT WE HAD WITH DINNER OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT IT'S A 100% RESOLVED BUT I KNOW THAT WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES. IN JUST SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT SHIFT THEM AND WE'RE SEEING IT NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE DATE OF THAT -- THAT THAT WE HAVE WITH YOU THROUGH THE GRANT. WHERE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE STARTING TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE RIGHT? IF THIS CHILD IS COMING INTO MY CLASSROOM AND HE HAS ALL HIS BAGGAGE WITH HIM. HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND THE LESSON THAT I'M THAT I'M TRYING TO TEACH. SO YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT'S LIKE A WHOLE BIGGER PICTURE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THAT DASHBOARD THE MEASURE SUBGROUPS. AND ALL OF THAT BUT THERE IS NO MEASUREMENT OF ANY OTHER TYPE OF WORK AND HOW. THOSE INDICATORS -- CORRELATE WITH THE WITH THE THE DATA THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING COLLECTED. SO THAT'S ONE THING AND AND DEFINITELY -- YOU KNOW JUST FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS I KNOW I HEARD THE THE FIRST GROUP A GENTLEMAN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS A NOBODY WANTED AS THEY I WANT IT. TELL ME WHAT I GOTTA DO AND I LOOK THAT UP A LITTLE BIT AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THE REQUIREMENTS WERE FOR THE FUNDING AWAY I WOULD HAVE PLAYED FOR EITHER JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS YOU KNOW. THEY WERE -- FORCING YOU TO MAKE LONG FORSMAN YOUR PARTNERS. WELL YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN A SECOND I JUST MET YOU I'M GONNA MARRY RAILING. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE YOU KNOW LIKE WE NEED TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER YOU NEED TO BUILD THAT RELATIONSHIP ENOUGH. YOU NEED TO YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO HOLD SOME SPACE THERE AND THEN YOU KNOW AFTER WE GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER WAY YOU KNOW WE COULD BE THE BECOME. YOU KNOW OF FRIENDS OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER BUT THERE YOU CAN'T JUST FORCE PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT LIKE YOU KNOW REALITY TV RIGHT. AND AND I THINK YOU KNOW JUST BEING HAVING THOSE HONEST CONVERSATIONS AND FOLKS WILL BE TAKING A LOOK AT AND WHEN THERE'S FUNDERS YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FUNDING. AND ARE THEY REALLY INTERESTED IN FUNDING OR THERE IS STILL FUNDING THEIR OWN IDEOLOGIES. YOU KNOW SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL OF YOU. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE'RE GONNA OPEN THIS UP NOW -- TO PUBLIC COMMENTS I DO ACKNOWLEDGE OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER KALRA WHO'S BEEN WITH US -- ALL THREE HOURS HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH BECAUSE AND FOR ALL OF YOU AGAIN WHO ARE SPOKEN TO AT THIS TIME.
