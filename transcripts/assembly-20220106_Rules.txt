WOOD HI MOTION PASSES THAT MOTIONS PASSED- WILL TURN OUT TO A. B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED IS OUR MOTION TO REFER THAT COMMITTEE THAT BILL TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. MAY BE HEARD BEFORE THE MOTIONS MITTERRAND MOVED BY CAREER SECOND ARREST OF STONE YES TO THE SPECIAL CHAIR OF QUESTIONS OF ONE MOMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IT HAS BEEN OVER THE LAST FIVE PLUS YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN SERVING AS VICE CHAIR WITH- MISTER COOL IS CHAIR OF THE PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF THE RULES COMMITTEE ON ALL BILLS THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT DO NOT SPECIFY A FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THEIR COST INCLUDING SB FIVE SIXTY TWO FROM YEARS AGO A. B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED THIS VERY BILL FROM LAST YEAR- TO HOLD THOSE BILLS IN THE RULES COMMITTEE AND NOT REFER THEM TO POLICY COMMITTEE- AND LESSEN UNTIL THEY IDENTIFY. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THEMSELVES OR PURPORT TO PAY FOR THEMSELVES. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE DEVIATING FROM THAT PRACTICE TODAY. I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. I DON'T THINK THIS BILL AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOES NOT. TELL YOU HOW IT PAYS TO ESTABLISH. A WHAT WILL BE THE LARGEST STATE BUREAUCRACY IN HISTORY. WHAT WILL REPLACE BASICALLY EVERY. PIECE WHETHER FEDERAL OR STATE OR PRIVATE OF OUR EXISTING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WITH SOMETHING RUN BY NINE PEOPLE- THAT'S A BIG MAJOR CHANGE IN THIS BILL ON ITS IN ITS TAX AND I'VE LOOKED THROUGH ALL OF IT IT DOES NOT TELL YOU WHAT TAX INCREASES OR SET OF TAX INCREASES ARE GOING TO FIND THIS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM. IT SHOULD BE HELD AND NOT REFERRED TO AS HAS BEEN OUR PATTERN AND PRACTICE ON BILLS ON THIS TOPIC THAT HAVE THIS INFIRMITY FOR FIVE PLUS YEARS THAT'S POINT ONE POINT TWO THIS BILL IS MY UNDERSTANDING SINGLE REFERRED TO HEALTH COMMITTEE. ALL THE RESPECT TO THE CHAIR THE HEALTH COMMITTEE IS HERE TODAY- SITTING FOR ABSENT MEMBER- I KNOW THE HEALTH CARE COMMITTEE THE HEALTH COMMITTEE IS QUITE COMPETENT TO REVIEW. THE HEALTH PROVISIONS OF THIS THIS BILL BUT THIS BILL SHOULD BE DOUBLE REFER TO READ AND TAX AT A MINIMUM. IF NOT ALSO REFERRED TO BUSINESS PROFESSIONS. CENTER WOULD PUT AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK OR PUT THEM. TO WORK IN VERY DIFFERENT MANNER THAN THEY WORK TODAY- SO THE SINGLE REFERRAL TO HEALTH I BELIEVE IS ALSO- INAPPROPRIATE ON POLICY GROUNDS. AT A MINIMUM THIS BILL SHOULD GO TO BOTH HEALTH. AND REVAN TAX. BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU PAY FOR BUREAUCRACY LIKE THIS THAT THIS BILL PROPORCIONAN WHICH- WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE WAY. THE STATE COLLECTS REVENUE FROM CITIZENS. IMPOSSIBLE AND WE ALL KNOW THAT. WITH LET'S NOT MAKE IT. ANY THERE'S NO DEBATE ABOUT THAT. THIS BILL HOWEVER IT IS GOING TO BE FUNDED. WILL POP BAND AND RESTRUCTURE. THE STATE'S REVENUE AND TAXATION FROM IT IT HAS PROP NINETY EIGHT IMPLICATIONS FOR OF K. TWELVE FUNDING. IT HAS PROP THIRTEEN IMPLICATIONS. AB THESE ARE BIG BIG CHANGES AND THEY SHOULD BE VETTED BY ALL THE POLICY COMMITTEES THE WE'VE ESTABLISHED IN THIS BODY. TO THAT POLICY. WHERE IT TOUCHES THAT SUBJECT MATTER NOT A SINGLE COMMITTEE. IT ALSO HAS THE PROBLEM WHERE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY TELL US ANY ESTIMATE HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST NOBODY'S CONDUCTED THAT THIS BODY HASN'T CONDUCTED THAT FORTUNATELY WE HAVE AN ENTITY WITHIN THIS INSTITUTION CALLED THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WHO'S VERY WELL SUITED. TO DO AN ANALYSIS OBJECTIVELY INDEPENDENTLY AND COME UP WITH NUMBERS THAT WE CAN ALL TRUST SO WE KNOW WHEN WE'RE VOTING FOR THIS ON THE FLOOR. OR DOWN THE LINE. HOW MUCH OF THE BILL WERE HANDING. TO PAY FOR IT AND WHO ARE HANDING OUT BILL TWO WHICH ARE VERY GOOD IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW. WHEN YOU REPRESENTING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO FOR THAT REASON I'M GOING TO MAKE A MOTION- THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THIRTY SEVEN POINT ONE. JOINT ROLE THE THIRTY SEVEN POINT ONE PROVIDES THAT ANY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY RECOMMEND THAT THE L. A. O. PREPARE A CITIZEN COST IMPACT ANALYSIS ON PROPOSED LEGISLATION. THE RECOMMENDED THE RULE FURTHER PROVIDES THE RECOMMENDATION SHALL SHALL FIRST BE HEARD BY. THE COMMITTEE ON RULES. AND THIS COMMITTEE RULES SHALL MAKE THE FINAL DETERMINATION. SO THIS MOTION WOULD SIMPLY IF WE VOTED FOR IT WOULD SEND THIS BILL TO THE L. A. O. FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A CITIZEN COST IMPACT ANALYSIS. THAT WOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF DIMENSIONS AS SPECIFIED BY THIS RULE INCLUDING THE ECONOMIC EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC GENERALLY THE SPECIFC ECONOMIC EFFECT ON BUSINESSES AND THE SPECIFIC TAX IMPACT. ON THE CITIZENS. I THINK WE NEED THAT INFORMATION. TO DISCHARGE OUR DUTIES AS LEGISLATORS IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER. IF WE WANT TO LOOK OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE EYE AND SAY HEY. YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE YOUR MEDICARE YOUR MEDICARE ALL. YOUR BARGAIN FOR HEALTH PLAN IN YOUR UNION THE YOU PAID INTO FOR DECADES. WERE TAKEN OUT OF WHY. WE'RE GIVING YOU A TAX BILL AND WE'RE HANDING YOU SOMETHING ELSE. GOOD LUCK QUEUING UP TO GET YOUR SERVICE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A STATE THEY CAN'T ISSUE DRIVERS LICENSES PROPERLY THROUGH THE DMV IN CANADA YOU. UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS PROPERLY THROUGH EDT BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE ALL OF THAT A STATE AGENCY AND IT'S GOING TO CONTROL EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR HEALTH CARE BEFORE WE CAN SAY HEY WE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA WE WANT TO DO THAT. WE AT LEAST NEED TO KNOW AND WE HAVE A DUTY TO FIND OUT AND HAVE THE L. A- FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST. THAT'S A MINIMUM. I FURTHER MOVED THAT THIS BILL BE A. B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED BE HELD IN THIS COMMITTEE UNTIL WE RECEIVE. THE COST IMPACT REPORT BACK FROM THE L. L. I THINK THAT'S A VERY REASONABLE THING TO DO I THINK. TAKING THAT COURSE OF ACTION RATHER THAN A SINGLE REFER TO HEALTH. SINGLE REFERRAL TO HEALTH CARE. WILL GIVE US THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED SO WE CAN LOOK OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE EYE. AND TELL THEM THAT WE ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE AS LEGISLATORS. SO THAT IS MY MOTION. WHAT WERE. LET ME THERE THERE IS A MOTION ON THE TABLE- UNDER JOINT RULE THIRTY SEVEN POINT ONE A LETTER CAN BE SUBMITTED RULES REQUESTING SUCH A STUDY. I ACTUALLY THINK THE TIME WILL BE RIPE. TO MAKE SUCH A REQUEST. ONE OF THE ISSUES HERE IS THAT UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. ARE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE CHAIR OUR SUMMER HEALTH COMMITTEE CHAIR HAVEN'T PARTICIPATED IN A PROCESS FOR A HEALTHY FOR ALL CALIFORNIA COMMISSION WHICH HAS BEEN DOING EXAMINATIONS OF THE GENERAL TOPIC OF HEALTH CARE. AND ARE GOING TO BE ISSUING A FINAL REPORT DEALING WITH THEIR ASSESSMENT OF FINANCING ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH BROAD AND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. THE ISSUE I HAVE IS IT IS THE HEALTH COMMITTEE WHICH IN APRIL LAST YEAR- REACHED OUT TO THE APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCY OF PROGRAM REVIEW TO GET A HIGH LEVEL INITIAL VIEW OF AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED. WHICH WAS BECAUSE OF OUR CHAIR HE SOUGHT THAT OUT. HE HAS BEEN SERVING ON THIS PANEL WHICH IS CLOSING IN ON AN UPDATED EVALUATION. WHEN THAT REPORT COMES OUT IT WILL ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY. WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL OR ANY SIMILAR BILL BECAUSE THE COMMISSION'S FOCUS ON BROADER ISSUES. WHAT IS KNOWN. AND WHAT IS NOT KNOWN THAT WE MIGHT ELUCIDATE BY FURTHER STUDY I SORT OF THINK THE TIME TO ASK THE L. A. O. TO WEIGH IN IS WHEN WE'VE HAD AN EVALUATION OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN OPEN. AFTER THIS LONG PROCESS. OF SO I ACTUALLY. PERSONALLY DO NOT FAVOR REFERRAL OTHER COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME. UNDER CALL O IT IS NOT UNUSUAL THAT WE HAVE DONE SINGLE REFERRALS. ON AND INDEED COMMITTEES THAT HAVE HAD OTHER BILLS REFERRED TO THEM HAVE SAID WE DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO SEE IT. ON. I ALSO THINK THAT ON BEHALF OF THE ASSEMBLY. THERE IS A ONE LEGISLATOR. WHO HAS THE TIME AND THE INTEREST AND HAS DISPLAYED THE TIME OF THE AT FIRST AND THAT'S THE CHAIR OF OUR HEALTH COMMITTEE WHO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN PARTICIPATE WITH OTHER MEMBERS ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS IN HISTORIC GROUND BREAKING LEGISLATION BREAKING A LOGJAM ON A VERY TOUGH ISSUE. BY COLLABORATION. HE IS HEAVILY INVESTED THIS TOPIC HE'S DONE THE WORK HE'S IN THESE CONVERSATIONS. WHATEVER HAPPENS A. B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED THERE'S AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ASSEMBLY. TO DO ONGOING WORK THIS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE- WORK OF THE ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AFTER PROP ONE OF THREE PASSED. A VERY COMPLICATED MEASURE DEAL WITH AUTO INSURANCE REGULATION AND PROPERTY CASUALLY REGULATION THE STATE. AND AMELIE UPON HIS PASSAGE. MAYBE IT WAS THE HORSES OUT OF THE BARN. THE ASSEMBLY CAREER FINANCE ACTUALLY ORGANIZED COMMITTEES OF THE WHOLE AND OTHER INDIFFERENT CDNS INSTITUTION OF THE ASSEMBLY. WAS FULLY GROUNDED ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS AT PROPOSAL. I THINK AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IF WE DO NOT MOVE THE BILL FORWARD THE BILL WILL SIT IN THE SENATE TILL THEY GET TO ASSEMBLY BILLS LATER IN THE YEAR. AND WE'LL OF LOST FIVE MONTHS. FOR A PRODUCTIVE EXAMINATION OF THE ISSUES AROUND THIS TOPIC. AND OF THIS TOPIC GOES BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY IN WASHINGTON DC WEISBERG TWO DAYS WITH A GUY NAMED ALLEN AND TOLD THAT OF STANFORD- WHO IS INTERESTED IN COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACES. MANAGED COMPETITION HEALTHCARE LONG BEFORE THE CLINTON EFFORT. I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THERE'S AMPLE BASIS FOR OUR- HEALTH COMMITTED TO A GOOD AND THOROUGH JOB AND USE THE TIME PRODUCTIVELY. IT POINT CLARIFICATION IF I CAN JUST PICTURE I BELIEVE THAT. JOINT RULE THIRTY SEVEN POINT ONE. BY ITS PLAIN TERMS SAYS ANY MEMBER CAN MAKE UP THIS MOTION AND THE RECOMMENDATION SHALL BE HEARD AND VOTED ON BY THE RULES COMMITTEE IT'S A SUBSTITUTE MOTION FOR THE PRAYER PRIOR MOTION THAT WAS MADE TO REFER AT. AND I THINK. I'D LIKE A VOTE ON. YEAH IT'S NOT A- IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE MOTION THERE'S NOTHING THAT THREE SEVEN ONE THAT ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY COMMITTEE IT IS A IS A ROUTE TO GET- EXAMINATION OF SUBSTANCE DONE- I FEEL THAT THE PROPER ROUTE IS A LETTER PROPOSING THAT AND I ACTUALLY TAKE IT AS A LETTER THAT IS SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT WE ARE ASKING THE L. A. O. TO DO- THAT ADDRESSES. KNOWN UNKNOWNS WITH RESPECT TO THIS. LARGE TOPIC- RESTAURANTS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR- IN LINE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON ON THIS BILL MY QUESTION IS- REVOLVE AROUND THE REVENUE- ASPECT OF THIS BILL I KNOW THERE'S INTENT IN THE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD ON IDENTIFYING THE REVENUE ASPECT OF IT SO IF I COULD GET SOME CLARITY AS FAR AS- I KNOW IT'S REFERRED TO HEALTH WHICH IS HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE IN OUR IN OUR STATE BUT THE REVENUE ALLOCATION PLAN THE REVENUE PLAN THAT'S IN HERE THAT'S- TALKED ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION- WHY WHY AREN'T WE SENDING THAT TO- TAX AND REV ALSO AT THIS TIME. IS THERE- SOME INFORMATION THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THAT'S COMING- AS FAR TO ADDRESS THAT PART OF IT. A THE FUNDING STRUCTURE IS. AT A HIGH LEVEL WELL UNDERSTOOD INVOLVES A NEED FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS ON THERE ARE PROVISIONS AND A CONSCIOUS AMOUNT OF THIS AFFECTED BEEN ADOPTED. SO I ANTICIPATE THAT AS EXAMINATION OF THAT ACA PROCEEDS- LIGHT WILL BE SHED ON ALL THESE ISSUES I THINK ARE IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE THE LEGISLATURE- MISTER WOODS SERVES ON THIS HEALTHY CALIFORNIA GROUP. THE AUTHOR OF AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WROTE TO SECRETARY GALLEY. ASKING FOR THEIR INPUT. ON THE FINANCING AND IN A RATHER LONG LETTER BASICALLY WAS TOLD. WHERE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WE'RE NOT GOING TO OFFER COMMENTARY ON YOUR BILL AT THIS TIME. THIS IS A. UNDERMINES THE ABILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ENGAGE IN FACTUAL INQUIRY- I DO BELIEVE AGAIN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ISSUE A REPORT I THINK THAT IS A RIPE SUBJECT FOR THE HEALTH COMMITTEE TO BRING TO THE FULL BODY TO WALK TO THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT IT WILL BUILD UPON THE STUDY THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD ALREADY INITIATED- IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR IT WILL IDENTIFY USES WE NEED FURTHER EXAMINATION AND THAT WILL GIVE US A POWERFUL LANDS TO EVALUATE. CONSCIOUS AMOUNT BEFORE COULD YOU MISTER WOOD MISTER FLORA. YEAH JUST A FOLLOW UP MITCHELL CHAIR- JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT. I HEARD THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE AN ACA THAT WOULD BE THE A MECHANISM TO- HAVE THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE REVENUE STREAM OF THIS THIS PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF. HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. YES THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOU MISTER CHIP. IT WAS INTRODUCED YESTERDAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND TO MY CALL ALMOST QUESTION ABOUT THE FUND SOURCE WHICH ACTUALLY WHAT I WANT TO TALK. ABOUT TO. FOR JUST A BRIEF MOMENT- IN THAT ACA. IT EXPLICITLY STATES THAT THIS MAY WOULDN'T AN EXCISE TAX. THE PAYROLL. PERSONAL IN HEALTHCARE TAX. AND ONE OF THE PARTS OF IN MIND. IS THAT THE MEASURE WOULD AUTHORIZE THE LEGISLATURE PART AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DETERMINED IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS TO FUND THESE PURPOSES TO INCREASE ANY. OR ALL TAXES. BY STATUTE PASSED WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS. THE ROUGH COSTS THAT IMPRINT IS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT WE'RE HERE THAT'S WHAT THESE TAXES- TRIED TO WERE ALREADY ADMITTED IN THIS THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH MONEY. SO GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK AND RAISE TAXES AGAIN. ONCE AGAIN BREAKING FROM THE PRACTICE THAT THAT TWO THIRDS VOTE. IF THIS GOES THROUGH IF THIS ACA. DOES NOT GET FIXED THIS FUNDING SOURCE DOES NOT GET SHAKEN OUT PROPERLY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SIMPLE MAJORITY. WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO RAISE TAXES ON EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE. I THINK THAT IS DEVASTATING. I THINK THAT IS INCREDIBLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD TAKE INCREDIBLY SERIOUS. WE'RE NOT JUST ASKING A TAX ON THE RICH. MIKE IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE THAT TALKS ABOUT ANYBODY MAKING OVER FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS GONNA GET A TAX. IT GOES UP FROM THERE. THAT IS LOW INCOME MIDDLE INCOME FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN WITH THEIR LABOR GROUPS AND HAVE HEALTH CARE PLANS. WE THROW IT OUT. IT WAS PUT SOMETHING NEW IN THEIR PLACE. COLLEAGUES ARM. OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. BUT TO JAM OF THIS DOWN THIS BODIES GROW. WITH VERY LITTLE. INPUT AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S ALREADY A CA IMPRINT BUT WE'RE STILL ONLY TALKING ABOUT SINGLE REFERRED TO UNDERSTAND CODE I GET ALL OF THAT. BUT WE HAVE THE LARGEST TAX IN TH COUNTRY'S HISTORY. STARING US IN THE FACE. AND WE'RE NOT JUST IN A DRIVEN TAX. THANK YOU MISTER FOR ARM. I GUESS THE ISSUE I WOULD SAY. OUR. THE ONLY BODY. THAT HAS CONSTITUTIONAL STANDING REALLY TO GRAPPLE WITH ISSUES OF THIS CHARACTER IS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. I AM STRONGLY IN FAVOR. OF KEEPING THIS CONVERSATION ANALYSTS SAY BODY. IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO LET THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH RUN A CONVERSATION. AT THE END WHEN A LAWMAKER ASKED FOR ADVICE THEY SAY WE CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU. WE HAVEN'T GOT A SIGN OFF FROM THE GOVERNOR. THAT IS AN AFFRONT TO THE DIGNITY OF THIS INSTITUTION. WE HAVE A CHAIRMAN. WHO HAS A RECORD OF A COMFY MIGHTY THINGS TO A BI PARTISAN EFFORT THAT IS FACT BASED ON SPEAKING OUT MEDICAL MARIJUANA MR LACKEY MR BONTA MYSELF BECAUSE A REGISTERED SAWYER REQUIREMENTS FOR LARA. WE HAVE SIX MONTHS I THINK BEFORE THE SENATE REALLY ENGAGES ON THIS BILL. SO I FEEL IT IS TIME OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH TO ME IS THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. IT'S THE VENUE THEY CAN PULL IN WHOEVER THEY WANT AS A PART OF JOINT HEARING. BUT I THINK THERE IS THERE IS A MEMBER IN THIS BODY. WHO IS INVESTED IN THE SUBJECT. AND BRING SOME STATURE AND SOME HISTORY ESOL I'M JUST SAYING. YOU KNOW IT'S I GOT UP THIS MORNING I DECIDED. IT'S SORT OF LIKE WERE. NOT RECOGNIZE OUR OWN AUTHORITY. THAT'S ABNEGATION SO I WENT LOOKING FOR MY OXFORD DICTIONARY AND LOOKED UP ABNEGATION TURNED AWAY FROM ONE'S OWN AUTHORITY AND I GOT QUITE A WAKE UP CALL READING THAT DICTIONARY DEFINITION AGGREGATION THE ACT OF ANNOUNCING A REJECTED SOMETHING MAKING POWER IT SAYS IN THE OXFORD DICTIONARY. I AM NOT A FAN OF ABROGATION OF POLITICAL LEGISLATIVE LAWMAKING POWER. THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE IT SHOULD BE DONE. I GRANT YOU YEAH- CUSTOMER WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BE PASSED BY THE VOTERS MEANS IT DOESN'T FEEL TO ME LIKE ACTUALLY THE SMALLER PROP WILL TREAT OUR PROP THIRTEEN TYPE OF ISSUE. BUT THIS IS THE VENUE WHERE WE ARE TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS. IT MAY BE THAT WE'RE OUT OF PRACTICE. AND I WOULD SAY UNDER TERM LIMITS AT A CERTAIN THE CASE. BUT THIS IS JANUARY. SIX I PREFER TO BET ON THE INSTITUTION. AND POLAR CONVERSATION INTO OUR CLOSETS AND OUR PUBLIC HEARING ROOMS. MISTER I JUST WANNA BE PERFECTLY CLEAR MY MOTION OR JOINT RULE THIRTY SEVEN POINT ONE- THAT AM I GOING TO GET A VOTE ON IT ONE AND TWO I WANNA BE PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT PROVIDES THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PART OF THIS INSTITUTION. DO THE STUDY NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES I THAT IS THAT IS ALL THAT I WAS GOING. YEAH I'M GOING TO ASK YOU SUBMIT THAT TO BE A LETTER BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON. THAT WITH THE CHAIRMAN. I ACTUALLY FEEL BECAUSE IT'S OUR OWN ENTITY WE ARE GOING TO WE HAVE THE PRODUCT OF THE EARLY STUDY THAT THE CHAIRMAN SECURED. ON THIS BILL. WE HAVE THE SOON TO BE RELEASED OVERVIEW OF FINANCING ISSUES OF WHICH SHE HAS BEEN A PARTNER IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS HE HAS FOLLOWED THEM. WITH HIS STAFF. WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT VERY QUICKLY WHERE DO PUSH POINTS TO BE WORK CRITICAL ISSUES. YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE LIKE LONG TERM CARE. SET UP A SYSTEM PROVIDE BENEFITS AND WHAT HAPPENED PEOPLE LIVE LONGER AND COST ROSE. THERE ARE QUESTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS THAT NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD. AND I FEEL THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A PRODUCTIVE OPPORTUNITY. TO GO TO THE ALEJO. BUT I FEEL IT SHOULD BE. TARGETED FOR THOSE KNOWN UNKNOWNS WE CAN IDENTIFY- SO THAT WE ACTUALLY DEVELOPER CORPUS OF INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THE EIGHTY MEMBERS OF THIS BODY THEIR DELIBERATIONS AND- I SAN BEDA LEISURE PROCESS I'M ALSO BETTING ON THE HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT SO I WOULD REQUEST ACTUALLY THAT- I WOULD HAVE DECLINED TO TAKE UP THAT. MOTION BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S PREMATURE BUT I WOULD REQUEST THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE FORM OF A LETTER AND- I WILL INTEND TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR ON HOW TO TARGET SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MR WHAT. ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN WHETHER I WANTED TO SPEAK ON THIS BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO ONE. PIECE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND A BUNCH I DO HAVE. INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF. AND THAT IS THE HEALTH FOR ALL COMMISSION. THE HELP BROUGHT COMMISSION EXIST BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION I DID AFTER- SB FIVE SIXTY TWO- WAS NOT REFERRED. THAT WAS OUR WORK GOVERNOR BROWN AGREED THAT WE SHOULD STUDY THIS ANY FUNDED IT IN A BUDGET. SO THAT COMMITTEE HAS BEEN COMMISSION HAS BEEN MEETING- FOR MONTHS NOW. AND I WANT TO WHAT SHOULD UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE BODY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMISSION DOES NOT ADDRESS HOW TO FIND A. B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED. IT DOES NOT WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT LOOKS AT ALL OF THE ISSUES. THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO FINANCE TO CREATE A PUBLICLY OR A UNIFIED PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY. SO WHEN IT'S THE WHEN THE REPORT IS RELEASED. IT MIGHT PRODUCE THE ROAD MAP TO HOW TO FUND THIS PROGRAM. BUT IT ALSO WILL LAY OUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE GOING FORWARD. AND I AM NOT A VOTING MEMBER I'M AN EX OFFICIO MEMBER- AND I'M THANKFUL- TO THIS BODY AND OUR LEADER- TO HELP TO GET ME ON TO THAT COMMISSION BECAUSE I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMISSION WERE IT NOT FOR THE LEADERSHIP IN THIS HOUSE NOR WOULD SENATOR PAT. SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE THERE AND PROVIDE INPUT AND LISTEN TO ALL OF THE DELIBERATIONS GOING FORWARD. AND SO. I'VE BEEN A PART OF THIS YEAH I KNOW WHAT'S COMING AND- AND I KNOW WHAT IT WILL OFFER AND I KNOW WHAT IT WON'T OFFER BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THAT ABOUT SOME OF THAT AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK WITH ANY ABOUT THAT GOING FORWARD OKAY. THANK YOU FOR WOULD. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO HAVE A MOTION. OF MY SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
