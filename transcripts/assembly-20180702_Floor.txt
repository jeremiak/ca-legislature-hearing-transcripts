FORTY SIX BY MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER THIS IS A CHAIR FORTY SIX CORPORATE READ. SO WE JOINT RESOLUTION FORTY SIX BY SOME REMEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER ANOTHER'S RELATIVES FEDERAL ZERO TOLERANCE ABOUT IMMIGRATION POLICY. MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AJ ARE FORTY SIX IS VERY SIMPLE AND ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RETHINK THEIR ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. WHICH HAS LED TO FAMILY SEPARATION CHILD DETENTION AND NOW THE PROMISE A PROLONGED FAMILY DETENTION AT OUR BORDER. I'M DEEPLY SADDENED THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS EVEN NECESSARY AND FRUSTRATED THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUOUSLY FIGHT OUR PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION. TO SIMPLY ACT IN A HUMANE MANNER. WHAT WE'VE WITNESSED IN RECENT MONTHS? IT'S VERY PERSONAL TO MANY OF US. BUT IT REALLY SHOULD BE PERSONAL. TO ALMOST ALL OF US. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS NEARLY ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS AT ONE POINT WHERE IMMIGRANTS. LET'S HEAR NATIVE AMERICAN OR AFRICAN AMERICAN. YOUR ANCESTORS CHOSE TO COME HERE. AND MANY TIMES. THE STORY WASN'T ALWAYS SO CLEAN. I THINK THOSE OF US WHOSE ANCESTORS CAME MOST RECENTLY. MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF THEIR STORIES IN A DIFFERENT WAY. I KNOW PERSONALLY. HOW MY FATHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY? AND I'M LIKE SO MANY OF THE REFUGEES THAT ARE COMING TODAY HE DIDN'T COME. TRYING TO SAVE HIS LIFE. HE CAME FOR A BETTER LIFE. BUT I'LL ALSO KNOW IS COMPLEX HE CAME RIGHT WHEN THE BRASS SADDLE PROGRAM WAS ENDING. THERE WAS NO REELS LINE TO STAND DOWN. BUT WHAT THE WE CAN A NOD. AND GROWERS WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED CHEAP LABOR. FOLKS COULD CROSS THE BORDER HERE TO WORK [inaudible] WAS COMPLICATED. THE LEGALITY OF IT IS COMPLICATED. AND EVEN TODAY WE TRY TO CLEAN UP THE WAY IN WHICH HE GOT HERE. PICKED OUR FOOD. PACKED OUR FOOD. STARTED A BUSINESS PAID TAXES SEND HIS KIDS TO COLLEGE. INSTILL STRUGGLES TO TRY TO BECOME A CITIZEN. OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COMPLEX. BUT SO MANY OF US WHO KNOW THOSE STORIES OF OUR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS OR MAYBE OURSELVES. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED AT THE BORDER TODAY AND REALIZE THAT COULD SO EASILY BE US. I'M HONEST ABOUT MY FAMILY. WHO'VE COME FROM MEXICO. ALL WITH DIFFERENT STATUS. SOME CAME ON A VISA THAT THEY OVERSTATED. SOME SIMPLY CAME HERE WITHOUT ANY DOCUMENTATION. SOME CAME IN WHAT THEY'RE CALLING CHAIN MIGRATION AND MARRIED SOMEBODY. BUT NONE OF THEM HAD A FORMAL PASSED. A LEGAL PATH. NOT OF A MORE FACING ATROCITIES OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE COMING TODAY FROM THESE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE TED. WEEKLY FLEEING FOR THEIR LIFE. MOST OF MY RELATIVES DIDN'T COME WITH CHILDREN THAT THEY HAD TO WORRY ABOUT BEING SEPARATED FROM THEY CAME HERE AND HAD CHILDREN. SO WHAT I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY I'D BE A HYPOCRITE. TO NOT STAND UP. AND SAY HOW WRONG IT IS. WHEN WE SEE CHILDREN CRYING FOR THEIR PARENTS AND PARENTS CRYING FOR THEIR CHILDREN? WHEN WE SEE THE POSSIBILITY A FAMILIES. LIVING TOGETHER INCARCERATED. FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG. WE HAVE TO THINK THAT WE'RE A BETTER COUNTRY THAN NOT. BECAUSE NO MATTER IF YOU KNOW YOUR IMMIGRANT HISTORY. FOR THE MAJORITY OF US WHO. WHO SOMEHOW HAVE AN IMMIGRANT HISTORY? OR WHETHER YOU SIMPLY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS ONE THING THAT'S CLEAR. WE HAVE ALL BENEFITED FROM THE HARD WORK. OF THOSE WHO CAME HERE WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION. IT'S NOT A POPULAR THING TO SEE OR TALK ABOUT. BUT WE'VE HAD OUR CHILDREN TAKING CARE OF WE HAD OUR BATHROOMS CLEANED. WE HAD OUR LANDSCAPED DONE. WE HAD OUR TABLES BUST OUR FOOD COOKED. AN EVEN IF YOU WANT TO DENY ANY OF THOSE THINGS IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN EATEN OUT AT A RESTAURANT OR EATING OUT AT A RESTAURANT OR IN A HOTEL. HAVING SOMEONE CLEAN UP AFTER YOU I GUARANTEE YOU THIS. YOU HAVEN'T EATEN FOOD. THAT WAS PICKED [inaudible] IMPACT BY SOMEBODY WHO'S HERE ILLEGALLY. AND IT WAS ALWAYS IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO TURN A BLIND EYE BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE. SO WE CAN'T ON ONE HAND. HAVE THE FRUITS OF THE LABOR OF HARD WORKING FOLKS IN THE STATE. AND ON THE OTHER HAND LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT OUR BORDER. THAT IT JUSTIFIES HUMANITY AND NOT STAND UP AND SAY. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH US THIRTY SECONDS WHAT WE CAN'T HAVE AN OPEN BORDER. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. WE DO HAVE TO HAVE RULES. BUT THOSE RULES CAN TREAT PEOPLE IN A MORE HUMANE WAY. AND OUR IMMIGRATION POLICIES CAN BE FIXED WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. WE NEED TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE PEOPLE. NOT ANIMALS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN EYE ON THIS RESOLUTION. DOCUMENTS GONZALEZ FLETCHER MS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RISE TODAY AND SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE DAY ARE. FORTY SIX I WAS SIXTH WHEN I WAS DEPORTED. TO WHAT IS MEXICO. I DO ME NO QUIET IS IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CITIES IN THE WORLD. MY FATHER HAD BEEN PART OF THE BETH HAD A PROGRAM. WHEN IT ENDED HE CONTINUED TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY WITH US TO WORK AND TO KEEP US SAFE? BUT DAVID DETAINED MY DAD. HE HAD BEEN WORKING IN CONSTRUCTION. WE WERE UP IN A PARK IN WINNIE TEXAS. AND I REMEMBER MEN IN UNIFORM. TALKING WITH HIM. I WAS SCARED. THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO GATHER OUR THINGS BEFORE SENDING US BACK TO WHAT IT. FOR A LONG TIME. I DIDN'T THINK I WAS AFFECTED AT ALL [inaudible] OR MUCH. BY THAT EXPERIENCE. BUT BUILT FRIGHTENING MEMORIES. CAME RUSHING BACK. AS I WATCH IMMIGRANT FAMILIES BEING SEPARATED AND CHILDREN CAGED. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ME. MY SISTERS AND MY BROTHERS. I THOUGHT OF MY OWN TWO CHILDREN. WHAT IF IT HAD BEEN THEM? NOT KNOWING. IF THEY WERE COLD OR HUNGRY. OR IN DANGER. AND KNOWING THAT A I WAS UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THIS IS HORRIFYING AND THEN HUMANE. MY PARENTS ONLY WANTED A BETTER LIFE FOR US [inaudible] FORTUNATELY. WE WERE ABLE TO RETURN. AND I WAS ABLE TO BECOME A CITIZEN. MY LOVE FOR THIS COUNTRY. FOR THIS GIFT PROMPTED ME TO RUN. FOR ELECTED OFFICE. MY FAMILY STORY. IS THE STORY OF MILLIONS HAVE COME HERE. SEEKING FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED AMERICA. FOR ITS COMPASSION AND OPENNESS TO EMIGRATE TO IMMIGRANTS. WHO WANT TO WORK HARD? AND STRIVE FOR THEIR DREAMS BUT TODAY. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS DECIDED TO DEMONIZED IMMIGRANTS. AND SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. PARENTS FLEEING POVERTY AND VIOLENCE ELSEWHERE. FOR A BETTER LIFE ARE NOW SIMPLY JUST TRYING TO REUNITE WITH THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS. THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WILL BE TRAUMATIZED FOR EVER. THIS IS WRONG. RESPONSIBLE. AND GOES AGAINST THE IDEALS. OF A GREAT NATION BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS. LET US REMEMBER WHO WE ARE AMERICA. IS AND ALWAYS. HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BEACON OF HOPE. TO THE WORLD. LET US RETURN TO BASE IDEAL AND AND THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY NOW. ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY. THE LATINO CAUCUS. THE WOMAN'S CAUCUS I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR. FORTY SIX THANK YOU MISS RUBIO. TO GIPSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE ALSO IN SUPPORT. OF THIS AG ARE FORTY SIX AN URGE NUMBER FORTY FIVE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION TO MERELY. CEASE AND DESIST IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ZERO TOLERANCE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY. THIS CURRENT POLICY IS IN HUMANE AND ALSO ITS SICKENS ME. AS A PARENT. IT SADDENS ME. THAT CHILDREN ARE STRIPPED AWAY. FROM THEIR FAMILIES FROM THEIR PARENTS. JUST TO SEEK ASYLUM. I CANNOT IMAGINE. IF MY OWN CHILDREN. WAS STRIPPED AWAY FROM ME THE SITUATION. THE SADNESS THE FEAR NOT ONLY FOR ME BUT ALSO FOR MY CHILDREN AS WELL. TO PUNISH ARE THESE CHILDREN. IS IN HUMANE. THIS IS NOT AMERICA. AND IS NOT AMERICAN. WE DON'T DO THIS WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS. AND I WANT TO REMIND -- MOST OF US. THAT THIS IS NOT NO THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL. A EVEN THOUGH I'VE READ ABOUT IT AND PEOPLE TOLD ME ABOUT IT. A I CAN ONLY [inaudible] IMAGINE [inaudible] WHAT [inaudible] AFRICANS [inaudible] WENT THROUGH. NOT ONLY TO BE PULLED FROM THEIR COUNTRY. BUT ALSO BEING PLACED. IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. AND THEN TO HAVE THE FATHER SOLD OFF. AND THE MOTHER SOLD OFF AND ALSO THE CHILDREN SEPARATED THE FEAR. THAT THAT COSTS AND SOME OF THESE CHILDREN WILL NEVER. BE REUNITED. WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL PARENTS. BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED WITH THIS POLICY. AND SO WHEN I THINK THE WOMAN FROM SAN DIEGO THOSE WHO'VE SPOKEN. AND CERTAINLY ASK A RESOUNDING AYE VOTE. ON AJ ARE. FORTY SIX NAMES GIPSON MISS QUIRK SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER A FEW WEEKS AGO I STOOD TO SPEAK ON ON THIS POLICY AND EVEN A FEW WEEKS AGO WE HAD LITTLE INDICATION. OF SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED A WHICH HAS BEEN SO. HORRIFYING IN STARTLING THAT I THINK MANY OF US HAVE HIGH I HAD A HARD TIME PROCESSING AT US THIS LAST WEEK AND THERE WERE THOUSANDS THAT MARCHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BASICALLY SAYING WE NEED TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER THIS AGAIN IS NOT A REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT ISSUE. THIS IS AN AMERICAN ISSUE. AND I STAND AGAIN AS A MOTHER IN AS AN EDUCATOR. TO TRY TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THE US AND I KNOW WE HAVE THE DADDIES CAUCUS HERE OF COURSE THE MOMMIES COCCUS AND GRANDMOTHERS AND GRAHAM. LAWYERS AND AID IN I JUST THE PICTURE I PAINTED LEARNING I HAVE FOUR OF MY OWN GROWING CHILDREN. AND I THINK ABOUT ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS WHO I I FEEL LIKE IT AND WHEN I'D PUT HER TO SLEEP I HAD TO CAREFULLY PUT HER IN THE CRIB. I HAVE WITH HER BLANKET AFTER SHE WAS ASLEEP. OTHERWISE YOU'D WAKE UP IN CRY AND CRY AND I THINK OF ALL OF THE WAYS MOTHERS AND FATHERS PUT THEIR KIDS TO SLEEP. FOR MANY OF I'M THERE'S A SPECIAL TOY THERE'S MUSIC OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY USE AND IT WITHIN A MOMENT TO BE TORN AWAY FROM YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER OR CAREGIVER. AND BE LEFT ALONE WITHOUT ALL OF WITHOUT THOSE THINGS THAT SU TH CHILDREN. I ALSO THINK ABOUT AS KIDS GET OLDER FOR SO MANY PARENTS RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM -- WHEN THEY GET TO SIXTH GRADE MANY OF THEM GO OFF TO FOR THE FIRST TIME TO CAMP? AND THAT'S A VERY BIG DEAL ON THEIR BAGS ARE PACKED IN YET PARENTS ARE NERVOUS IN LETTERS ARE WRITTEN AND AND TEARS. AND YET THEY KNOW THEIR PARENTS ARE COMING BACK IN THE GOING TO SEE A MENU AND IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL. BUT AGAIN TO THINK ABOUT HAVING A CHILD RIPPED AWAY FROM YOU AND NOT KNOW IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN. PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE YOUNG BABIES WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SPEAK YET HOPING THAT MAYBE THEY DID TAKE OF I FINGERPRINT SO THEY COULD BEREUNITED. AND THEN AGAIN NOW TO SEE SOME OF THOSE REUNIONS AND JUST SEE THE SOBBING AND SOBBING AND NO THIS IS NOT RIGHT. SO WHICHEVER WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT A POLICY WE KNOW THAT THIS POLICY IS NOT RIGHT AND WE HAVE TO DIG DEEP AND WE HAVE TO LOOK WITHIN OUR HEARTS TO SAY THAT WE CAN DO BETTER. WE CAN FIX WHAT IS NOT WRONG URGE YOUR NAME IS QUIRK SILVA. MR THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR FORTY SIX I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND BRING IT FORWARD. AND FOR ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN WILL SPEAK ON THIS MATTER TODAY. AND I ECHO -- THE SENTIMENTS OF THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN THAT WE SHOULD NEVER. A SEPARATE OUR FAMILIES I'M IN AND I RISE WHILE THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ARE NOT WHAT I WOULD HOPE. I I FEEL HONORED TO BE ABLE TO STAND ON THIS FLOOR. AND BILL TO SPEAK ON THIS RESOLUTION -- ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE -- ALL OF MY AUNTS AND UNCLES AND MY GRANDPARENTS WE'RE IMMIGRANTS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. ARE BORN SOMEPLACE ELSE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY IN HOPES OF CREATING A BETTER LIFE MY GRANDMOTHER CAME HERE. AND SHE ESSENTIALLY AS A TEENAGER I CLEAN PEOPLE'S BATHROOMS -- MY AUNTIES -- MANY OF THEM WERE LOW PAID -- HEALTH CARE ASSISTANCE WHO WOULD BAY SOMEONE OR CHANGED NOW MORE TEND TO WHATEVER -- THEIR PHYSICAL NEEDS MIGHT BE. AND WHILE MY FAMILY. WAS NEVER SPLIT UP BECAUSE OF DEPORTATION OR IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES UP MY HEART GOES OUT TO THOSE FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO KNOW THAT ANY SEPARATION FROM A CHILD CAN BE DEVASTATING YOU CAN HAVE LIFELONG IMPACTS FOR THEM. I I NOTICED LIKE TO BE SEPARATED FROM FAMILY THOUGH WHILE IT WAS NOT RELATED TO IMMIGRATION -- MANY OF YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH I LOST MY FAMILY AND AT A VERY EARLY AGE -- WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD I LOST MY MOTHER TO CANCER MY FATHER WAS NOT IN MY LIFE? AND I GOT SENT [inaudible] TO FOR AND I DO NOT SEE MOST OF MY SIBLINGS FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS. NOW. FORTUNATE FOR ME THE PERSON WHO I WAS SENT TO LIVE WITH WAS A FAMILY MEMBER -- ALBEIT A COUSIN WHO I NEVER MET TO I SHOWED UP ON HER DOORSTEP IT WAS STILL DIFFICULT. IT WAS DIFFICULT AS A CHILD TO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR MOTHER IS NOT COMING BACK TO NOT UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE TO NOT SEE A FAMILIAR FACE. AND I SAY THAT AND LIFT THAT UP TO ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE IMPACTS MUST BE FOR THE NINE MONTH THE YEAR OLD FOR THE ONE YEAR OLD FOR A CHILD OF ANY AGE. WHO IS SEPARATED FROM HIS OR HER MOTHER OR FATHER OR FROM THEIR SYMBOL FROM THEIR SIBLINGS OR FROM SIMILAR SURROUNDINGS? WHAT'S EQUALLY TROUBLING TO ME. IS THAT WHILE VIS DEVASTATING POLICIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT MANY [inaudible] COMPANIES HAVE PROFITED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THIS WORK IN JUST A SHORT PETER TIME WE SHOULD PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THAT. UP MANY OF THE PRIVATE PRISONS I'M HAVE PUT PROFITS OVER WHAT I WOULD SAY OUR AMERICAN VALUES AND PRINCIPLES [inaudible] FAMILY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS ALLOWED FOR THIS DIVISIVE IN CRUEL POLICY TO BECOME A PROFIT. VENTURE FOR MANY CALIFORNIA HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES IN THE COUNTRY. ALMOST HALF OF THE STATE'S DETENTION FACILITIES ARE OPERATED BY PRIVATE COMPANIES TO DETAIN IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM THROUGHOUT. COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THESE COMPANIES HOUSE NEARLY 75% OF CALIFORNIA DETAINEES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND 71% OF DETAINEES NATION WIDE. AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THESE PRIVATE PRISON COMPANIES HOUSING PROFIT OFF OF OVER THREE THOUSAND IMMIGRANT DETAINEES IN CALIFORNIA ONE COMPANY ALONE GTO. COLLECTED APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY OF TAXPAYER MONEY. NATIONALLY THE SAME COMPANY RECEIVES MORE MONEY FOR IMMIGRATION DETENTION THAN ANY OTHER ICE CONTRACTOR WHILE THEIR FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN CITED FOR SOME OF THE MOST INHUMANE. PRACTICES ANOTHER COMPANY COURSE CIVIC THE LARGEST FOR PROFIT PRISON COMPANY WAS CONTRACTED FOR JUST UNDER A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR ICE RELATED SERVICES AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THIS YEAR CALIFORNIA WILL SPEND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ON THESE COMPANIES FOR VARIOUS SERVICES INCLUDING HOUSING CALIFORNIA INMATES. IN AND OUT OF THE STATE. WE SHOULD STAND UP AS CALIFORNIANS AS AS AMERICANS AND SAY. THAT WE REALLY CARE ABOUT FAMILY VALUES THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE TRADITION OF THIS STATE. WE HAVE INVESTED. IN MAKING IT EASIER FOR NATURALIZATION WE SHOULD STAND UP AND BE LEADERS FOR OUR NATION AND SAY IT'S TIME TO CREATE. A RESPONSIBLE IMMIGRATION PLATFORM THAT CREATES A CITIZEN OF A PATHWAY TOWARD CITIZENSHIP. SHE SAID WE VALUE FAMILIES AND KEEPING THEM TOGETHER NO MATTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH THAT THEY ARRIVE AND WE SHOULD SAY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW PROFIT SYRIAN. TO BENEFIT THOSE WHO WOULD STAND TO SEPARATE COMPANIES SEPARATE CHILDREN SO THAT THEIR COMPANIES CAN PROFIT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON AG ARE. FORTY SIX THANK YOU MISTER AUTHORED THIS CARILLO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS WHEN I THINK OF THE WORD TRADITION. IT USUALLY IMPLIES SCRIPT THINKS. HOLIDAY TRADITIONS CHRISTMAS THANKSGIVING. BUT NOT IN THE CASE OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES THIS HAS BEEN A TRADITION. OF THE UNITED STATES A TRADITION TO SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS DURING SLAVERY A TRADITION. A SEPARATE NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS A TRADITION. A SEPARATE JAPANESE AMERICAN KIDS ONE JAPANESE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND NOW A TRADITION THAT CONTINUES. WITH THE SEPARATION OF UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN INTO THIS COUNTRY BEING PUT IN CAGES. SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. THERE IS A BUSINESS TRADITION BUT THE UNITED STATES HAS. A BUSINESS OF SLAVERY. BUSINESS OF BOARDING SCHOOLS FOR NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN. BUSINESS FOR CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND NOW A BUSINESS FOR DETENTION CENTER. THE DIFFERENCE NOW. IS THAT THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE AND IS TRANSPARENT. WHEN WE GET TO HOLD IT ACCOUNTABLE? WE HAVE THE INFORMATION AT OUR FINGERTIPS. WE UNDERSTAND AND KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT NEW. AND THAT IT WILL CONTINUE. AND THAT IS UP TO US. DECIDE WHAT KIND A STATE AND WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY. WE WANT TO LEAD IN HALF. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH. IT IS NOT ENOUGH IN WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND HOW WE PLAN ON REUNITING OVER. TWO THOUSAND IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES.% MANY OF WHOM. DON'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH IN FACT MANY OF WHOM ARE INDIGENOUS. TO CENTRAL AMERICA. MANY OF WHOM REQUIRE A TRANSLATOR FOR THE MESS SO AMERICAN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HEARING IN THE NEWS BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NEEDED. I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY WHEN I WAS. FIVE MANY OF YOU KNOW MY STORY I'VE SHARED IT ON THIS FLOOR. MY FAMILY IN I WORD SEEKING REFUGE ASYLUM WHICH IS NOT ILLEGAL IN FACT THAT IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF THE LAW. OF THESE UNITED STATES THAT YOU CAN'T COME AND SEEK ASYLUM THANK YOU CAN COME AND SEEK REFUGE. WE LEFT A CIVIL WAR THAT LASTED TWELVE YEARS. MANY OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE LEAVING CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES NOW OUR LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES NOW. ARE LEAVING. IN THOSE SAME CONDITIONS. AND THESE PARENTS THESE MOTHERS AND FATHERS SIX CHILDREN WHO WITH EVERYTHING. TRY TO START ANY LIKE TO HAVE A CHANCE OF LIFE. OUR THE BEST TYPE AMERICANS THAT WE CAN HAVE. THESE ARE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING AS A COUNTRY. WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS OUR NATION IS A MORAL? IT'S UNLAWFUL IT'S FUN JUST IT IS NOT ABOUT FREEDOM. IT IS NOT ABOUT JUSTICE. THIS IS ABOUT HEAT IT IS ABOUT BUSINESS. IN IS ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE BEHIND BARS. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. TO I COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR PUTTING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO MR GABRIEL. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF AJ ARE. FORTY SIX WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING FOR THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION. SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO THE VALUES OF COMPASSION AND DECENCY THAT WE JUST CALIFORNIANS HOLD DEAR. I ALSO WANT TO THANK AND RECOGNIZE OUR TOURNEY GENERAL HAVE YOUR BUT SARAH AND HIS STAFF FOR THE LITIGATION THEY HAVE BROUGHT CHALLENGING THE ADMINISTRATION'S. IMMORAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY AND FOR THEIR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO DEFEND OUR CALIFORNIA VALUES. IN ADDITION TO BEING CONTRARY TO CALIFORNIA VALUES THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES IS ALSO DEEPLY ANTITHETICAL TO JEWISH VALUES. AND WITH PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO READ FROM A LETTER THAT WAS SENT BY A COALITION OF TWENTY SEVEN NATIONAL JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS POLICY WITHOUT OBJECTION. WE WRITE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE RECENTLY EXPANDED ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY THAT INCLUDES SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR MIGRANT PARENTS WHEN THEY CROSS THE BORDER. THIS POLICY UNDERMINES THE VALUES OF OUR NATION AND JEOPARDIZES THE SAFETY AND WELLBEING OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. AS JEWS WE UNDERSTAND THE PLIGHT OF BEING AN IMMIGRANT FLEEING VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND HOW WE TREAT THE STRANGER REFLECTS ON THE MORAL VALUES AND IDEALS OF THIS NATION. MANY OF THESE MIGRANT FAMILIES ARE SEEKING ASYLUM IN THE UNITED STATES TO ESCAPE VIOLENCE IN CENTRAL AMERICA. TAKING CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES IS UNCONSCIONABLE. SUCH PRACTICES INFLICT UNNECESSARY TRAUMA ON PARENTS AND CHILDREN. MANY OF WHOM HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. THIS ADDED TRAUMA IT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. PRECLUDING INCREASING THE RISK OF EARLY DEATH. OUR JEWISH FAITH DEMANDS US. DEMANDS OF US CONCERNED FOR THE STRANGER IN OUR MASTS. OUR OWN PEOPLE'S HISTORY A STRANGER'S REMINDS US OF THE MANY STRUGGLES FACED BY IMMIGRANTS TODAY AND COMPELS OUR COMMITMENT TO AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS COMPASSIONATE AND JOBST. WE URGE YOU TO IMMEDIATELY RESCINDED ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY AND UPHOLD HE VALUES OF FAMILY UNITY AND JUSTICE ON WHICH OUR NATION WAS BUILT. SHORT FOR A COMMUNITY IT WHERE THERE IS OFTEN DEBATE ON CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES. THERE IS BROAD CONSENSUS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY THAT THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY IS CONTRARY TO OUR NATION'S HIGHEST TRADITIONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GABRIEL MS RACE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. TODAY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AJ ARE. FORTY SIX WHICH CONDEMNS A FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY OF SEPARATING FAMILIES THROUGH THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. POOR NATION WHICH QUITE LITERALLY HAS BEEN BUILT ON THE BACKS OF IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY WITH IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS HAS BEEN TUMULTUOUS [inaudible] AT BEST. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINST POLICIES. CLEARLY AND UNABASHEDLY HAVE NO REGARD FOR BASIC HUMANITY. WE CANNOT ALLOW THE TYPE OF IN HUMANE. SCARRING TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS TO CONTINUE TO BE THE REIGNING NARRATIVE OF AMERICAN HISTORY. IN THE RECENT COURT RULING WHICH MANDATED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO RETURN YOUNGER CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS. THE JUDGE NOTED THAT PRESENTLY. MIGRANT CHILDREN ARE NOT EVEN ACCOUNTED FOR WITH THE SAME EFFICIENCY INACCURACY. HAS PROPERTY WOULD BE. HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS? WITH VIRTUALLY NO SYSTEM TO ENSURE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS. WELL YOU CAN TRACK A PIECE OF FURNITURE YOU'VE ORDERED ON AMAZON ACROSS BORDERS AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS. I AM PLOY YOU MY COLLEAGUES. WITH THIS GREAT HONOR WE SHARE REPRESENTING OUR CONSTITUENCIES. TO THINK CRITICALLY OF WHERE WE WILL STAND AND WHAT WE WILL BEAT WHAT WE ARE. AND WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THIS MOMENT OF HISTORY. BECAUSE GENERATIONS DOWN THE LINE WILL REMEMBER. THOSE WHO ALLOWED AN ADVOCATE FOR THE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHERS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. AND FOR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO FIGHT FOR A HOLISTIC REFORM TO WORK IN HUMANE IMMIGRATION POLICY [inaudible] MISTER BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND AS A PROUD. CO AUTHOR IN SUPPORT OF AJ ARE. FORTY SIX ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY IS INHUMANE IT'S IMMORAL AND IT DOES NOT REPRESENT WHO WE ARE. OR WHO SHOULD BE. FIRST IT SEPARATED CHILDREN. FROM THEIR PARENTS THEN. ONLY AFTER NATIONAL. PUBLIC OUTRAGE THE ADMINISTRATION BEGAN TO INCARCERATE FAMILIES TOGETHER. MEMBERS WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE WE SAW THIS WHEN JAPANESE AMERICAN FAMILIES. WHO HAD EVERY RIGHT TO LIVE FREELY IN OUR COUNTRY? WERE INCARCERATED DURING WORLD WAR. TWO THESE FAMILIES COMING TO OUR BORDERS ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HERE AS THEIR CASES. FOR ASYLUM ARE BEING HURT. THIS IS ONLY THE LATEST ACTION BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO CREATE FEAR. CHAOS AND DRAMA IN OUR IMMIGRANT. COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE NATION [inaudible] SCHOOL. AND IS REPREHENSIBLE AND IT MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY. AS WE SAW THE HUNDREDS OF NATIONWIDE MARCHES AND RALLIES THIS PAST SATURDAY MANY OF YOU WERE OUT THEM. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS ARE CALLING ON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. TO ELIMINATE ITS ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY AND TO TREAT THOSE SEEKING SAFETY WITHIN OUR BORDERS. WITH DIGNITY AND WITH COMPASSION I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR VOTE FOR AJ ARE. FORTY SIX THANK YOU MISTER BONTA MISTER CHIU. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRS ARE MEMBERS AND SANK THOUGHT CALLING FROM OUTSIDE EAGLE PROGRAMMING OF THOSE VERY IMPORTANT. ISSUES ARE ON THE FLOOR -- I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT A VERY POPULAR TERM. A CHAIN MIGRATION WAS ACTUALLY CALLED FAMILY YOUR REUNIFICATION AND THAT'S HOW I BROUGHT MY WIFE WILL FORTY TWO TWO YEARS PUTTING MY TO STATE. AND OUT ALL OVER THE WEEKEND I KNOW TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AND I ATTENDED A RALLY IN SAN JOSE. I TELL YOU I WAS BROUGH REALLY REALLY HEARTENED TO SEE SO MANY YOUNG CHILDREN. YOU KNOW INFANT. YOU KNOW TO TO THE ACCOUNT GOES AROUND THE AYE INITIALLY I FEEL KIND OF GUILTY BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE MY MY MY THREE YEAR OLD GRANDCHILDREN. BUT A FIVE YEAR OLD THREE OH GRANDCHILDREN WITH ME BUT THEN I CAN REALLY REALLY MAD. WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY WE'RE LOOKING AT? WELL KIDS YOU KNOW. A TWO MONTHS OWE YOU DON'T CAMP BEDDING BLOCK HOUSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE RALLY. BUT THEN I REALIZED THE MASSACHUSETTS VERY VERY IMPORTANT WE NEED TO DELIVER TO THOSE. CAMPS THAT ARE LOCKING PAGERS THAT THEY ARE NOT ALONE SO I ENCOURAGE YOU AYE AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHIU SURE CALDERON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- I READ SOMETHING THIS MORNING -- THAT MADE ME FEEL REAL TERRIBLE EARLIER A SEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL WAS REUNITED WITH HER MOTHER. AFTER NEARLY NEARLY TWO MONTHS IN AN IMMIGRATION. DETENTION CENTER. AND THE MOMS MESSAGE TO OTHERS MOTHERS OTHER MOTHERS WAS THIS MISTER SPEAKER PERMISSION TO READ [inaudible] WITHOUT OBJECTION. IF YOU'RE THINKING OF CLAIMING ASYLUM. FIND ANOTHER COUNTRY. THE LAWS HERE HARSH. AND PEOPLE DON'T HAVE HEARTS. THAT TO ME COULDN'T SPEAK. LESS TO MY MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN. WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FROM THE GREATEST COUNTRY? IN THE WORLD. TO BE THE GREATEST COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES TO CARING AND LOVING. OTHER PEOPLE AND BEING ABLE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THOSE AN UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO FLEE TO SAVE THE LIVES. AND THE LIVES OF THEIR KIDS AND I WAS ACTUALLY DISCUSSING THIS LAST NIGHT WITH MY WIFE -- BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN US AWHILE BUT WHEN THE SHOWS THAT WE WATCHES HANDMAID'S TALE AND AND AND WE'VE WE'VE MADE YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT. AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER ON THIS FLOOR I'M MAYBE POTENTIAL PARALLELS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS DIFFICULT WAS THAT IN THIS LAST EPISODE WAS UP EPISODE ELEVEN IT'S ENOUGH THICKNESS WHILE BECAUSE OF HOW HEAVY THE SHOW IS -- WAS THE MAIN AUTHOR OF THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS GOT A MOMENT TO SEE HER CHILD WHO HAD SHE HAD BEEN TURNED OUT TORN AWAY FROM. AND IN THAT MOMENT THE CHILD RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS HER MOTHER BUT WAS STILL SCARED OF HER MOTHER -- IT SEEMS BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE WASN'T SCARED OF HER MOTHER. SHE WAS UPSET WITH HER MOTHER AND MESSAGE WAS WHY DIDN'T YOU FIGHT HARDER. WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY HARDER TO FIND THE TO COME AFTER ME TO BRING ME BACK TO YOU INTO BACK TO DAD AND IT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL SHE'S A SLAVE? IT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE NOW PUTTING THESE KIDS. ARE IN THE POSITION THAT WE'RE PUTTING THEM IN AND WE HAVE TO THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THIS ISN'T ABOUT BEING A DEMOCRAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT BEING A REPUBLICAN. IT'S ABOUT BEING US AS HUMAN BEINGS AS AMERICANS AND WHAT WE STAND FOR AND WHAT IS VALUABLE TO US AND WHETHER WE NOT WE WE VALUE. OUR HUMAN VALUES OR NOT AND I THINK WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE ABOUT A LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT IT BECOMES ABOUT DEMOCRAT VERSUS REPUBLICAN. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE A BALLOT SHOULD BE ABOUT WHO WE ARE. AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IS RIGHT AS INDIVIDUALS AS PARENTS AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS SO ON AND SO FORTH BECAUSE I DON'T CARE IF SOMEBODY IS A DIFFERENT POLITICAL IDEOLOGY THAN ME. I BELIEVE IN SOMEBODY BECAUSE THEY ARE AMERICAN I KNOW THAT DEEP DOWN INSIDE OF A WE MAY DISAGREE POLITICALLY WE STILL SHARE THE SAME VALUES AS TO WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS ALL ABOUT IT'S ABOUT RESIDENT IT'S ABOUT SHOWING THAT OUR VOICE AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AS A REALLY IMPORTANT STATE TO THIS. NATIONAL ECONOMY AND TO THIS NATION. THAT WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POLICY THAT IS INHUMANE BECAUSE I'VE HEARD DISTANT RATIONALES US WHY THIS POLICY EXISTS EITHER IT'S BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE USED AS LEVERAGE TO TRY TO GET SOME I'M I'M AT THE OTHER POLITICAL SIDE TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT -- OR ITS TO DETER OTHER PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. BOTH AT RATIONALIZATIONS ARE IN HUMANE BOTH ARE WRONG. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ABOUT. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE A PARTISAN ISSUE THIS JUST NEEDS TO BE ABOUT AN ISSUE ARE WERE INDIVIDUALS NOT LEGISLATORS THAT ARE LABELED WITH THE DEER ON OUR THAT'S NOT WHAT'S IMPORTANT. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WHERE PEOPLE AND THAT WE CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLACES BECAUSE THAT SHOULD MATTER TO US BECAUSE IT HAS MATTER TO US THATS WHY WERE THE GREATEST NATION IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE OUR NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THAT. SO I REALLY THINK THE AUTHOR UP FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON MISTER COOLEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. AND ON THIS DAY. I THINK OF THE IMAGE. SET BY JOHN WINTHROP. WHO WAS THE LEADER OF THE FLAG SHIP ARBELLA [inaudible] FOR THE GROUP OF COLONISTS RICHER COLORS. LOOKING TO ESTABLISH THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY COLONY STEAM. THIRTY AND HE CHALLENGES COMPANIONS ON THAT SHIP. TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING AS ESTABLISHING A CITY SET ON THE HILL. THAT THE ENTIRE WORLD WOULD BE LOOKING AT AND THIS IMAGE OF THE UNITED STATES IS A CITY SET ON THE HILL. IS ONE HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY PICKED UP. JOHN KENNEDY SPOKE OF IT WHEN HE VISIT MASSACHUSETTS DURING HIS PRESIDENCY. BUT OFTEN TIMES [inaudible] RONALD REAGAN. OR GOVERNOR OR PRESIDENT SPOKE OF IT. AND PERMISSION TO READ. THIS WAS HIS STATEMENTS IN HIS FINAL ADDRESS TO THE NATION WITHOUT OBJECTION. JANUARY ELEVENTH [inaudible] NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE RONALD REAGAN. I'VE SPOKEN OF THE SHINING CITY ALL MY POLITICAL LIFE. BUT I DON'T NOR FAVOR QUITE COMMUNICATED WHAT I SAW WHEN I SAID IT. BUT IN MY MIND IT WAS A TALL PROUD CITY. BUILT ON ROCK STRONG WRITTEN NOTIONS. WHEN SWEPT GOD BLESSED AND TEEMING WITH PEOPLE OF ALL KINDS? LIVING IN HARMONY AND PEACE. A CITY WITH REPORTS THAT HUMMED WITH COMMERCE AND CREATIVITY. AND IF THERE HAD TO BE CITY WALLS. THE WALLS HAD DOORS AND THE DOORS WERE OPEN TO ANYONE WITH A WILLING HEART TO GET HERE. THAT'S HOW I SAW. AND I SEE IT'S STILL. COLLEAGUES HUNDRED HONOR TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS [inaudible] RESOLUTION. WE SIT IN THE CHAMBERS. WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN A FRONT OF US WHO ARE GETTYSBURG SPOKE OF THIS NEW NATION. THIS NEW NATION WHICH WAS INDEED NO BUT ALSO WAS A DIFFERENT NATION. WORTH FIGHTING TO PRESERVE. AND I THINK THIS QUESTION WHAT IS THIS NEW NATION WHAT AS IT'S UNFOLDING. WILL REMAIN A CITY ON THE HILL. REMAINS A VITAL QUESTION ARE DAY ATTESTED TO BY MANY PRESIDENTS. AND I'M HONORED TO RISE AND SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY MISTER EDUARDO GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I AM COMPELLED TO RISE AS SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE SPOKEN ABOUT THEIR PARENTS. AND THE ARRIVAL TO THIS COUNTRY. FOR THE REASONS THAT MANY HAVE ALREADY. OUTLINED I'M ENCOURAGED. BY THE WORDS IN. THAT HAVE MENTIONED UP BY EVERYONE HERE ON THE FLOOR TO TO SHARE A STORY WITH YOU. I WAS INTERVIEWED BY LOCAL REPORTERS LAST WEEK TO TALK ABOUT THE CHILDREN. AND HOW IT IS JUST. RESPONSIBLE AND QUITE FRANKLY IN HUMANE HOW. THESE CHILDREN ARE BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. AND THE CONDITIONS THAT THAT THEY ARE HAVING TO ADHERE. TO IN THE QUESTION BEGAN GOING TOWARDS THE TRAUMATIZING EXPERIENCE [inaudible] OF THESE CHILDREN HAVING TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS AND IT BROUGHT TO MIND. A MEMORY THAT I HAD TUCKED AWAY REALLY FAR BACK. IN MY HEAD. THE ONE WHERE -- AT EIGHT YEARS OLD. OUR FATHER IS DETAIN DE HE OVERSTAYED HIS [inaudible] VISA. HAD A BIT ALREADY ESTABLISHED A FAMILY WORKING. AS A GARDENER. AND BEING DETAINED IN BEING -- DEPORTED. AND THROUGH THE PROCESS BEING ALLOWED TO BE IN THE DETENTION CENTER. KNOW CENTRAL CALIFORNIA I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD. AND SO AYE AYES THE INTERVIEW IS PROGRESSING I BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT [inaudible] THE FEELING. THOSE NINE MONTHS. THAT MY FATHER WAS DETAINED THAT MY MOTHER WAS CARING FOR MYSELF. AND HERSELF AS SHE CLEAN THEIR HOUSES AS A AWAY OF SUSTAINING THE FAMILY FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME. ON HER OWN AND I REMEMBER THE FEELING [inaudible] THAT CHRISTMAS. OF NOT HAVING OUR FATHER THERE WAS OF THE FACT I REMEMBER. THAT DUSTY OLD COUCH WHERE I WAS SITTING AT GRANDMA'S HOUSE WHILE ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE PLAYING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME WAITING FOR IT. TO BE MIDNIGHT ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF CHRISTMAS AND ME SITTING THERE IN MY MOM'S ARMS CRYING MY LUNGS. NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS GONNA COME BACK OR NOT NOT. CARING ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE. NOT A CHRISTMAS PRESENT. OR ANY OTHER GIVE. COULD FILL THAT VOID THAT FEELING THAT GAP. THAT WAS THERE AT THAT MOMENT NOT KNOWING IF. DAD WAS GONNA BE. REUNIFIED WITH US. THAT'S THE MEMORY THAT WAS BROUGHT TO ME AS WE SEE. THESE IMAGES ON TV AS I'M DOING THIS INTERVIEW WITH THIS REPORTER. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I HAD TUCKED [inaudible] BACK. BACK BACKPACK SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T CARE TO REMEMBER. AND ALL I COULD REMEMBER IS JUST CRYING MY LUNGS OFF NOT KNOWING IF THAT WAS GOING. TO B. RECONNECTING WITH US. R. TELL YOU I HAD THIS CONVERSATION THIS WEEK IN WITH MY FATHER. AS ARE PARENTS GET OLDER AND THEY GET SICK. BEGAN TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IN GREATER APPRECIATION OF THEIR TIME THAT THEY'RE HERE WITH US. AND I ASKED HIM A QUESTION I SAID IF HE REMEMBERED. THAT MOMENT BUT QUITE FRANKLY IT WAS ABOUT ME WANTING TO TALK ABOUT [inaudible] I REMEMBER. RIGHT BECAUSE OF COURSE HE'S GONNA REMEMBER [inaudible] BEING. DETAINED AND NOT KNOWING HIS FAITH OF COURSE HE WAS GONNA REMEMBER BUT IT WAS MY WAY OF WANTING TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT MADE ME FEEL. AND LET HIM KNOW HOW SCARY THAT WAS [inaudible] HOW FRIGHTENING [inaudible] THE UNCERTAINTY. AND QUITE FRANKLY JUST. LOSING YOUR PARENT TO A SITUATION THAT IS DEFINED. BY A FENCE [inaudible] A WALL. THAT WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT NOT NECESSARILY THINKING ABOUT THE LIVELIHOOD [inaudible] SAFETY. ASPECT OF KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. AND THE EMOTIONAL. IMPORTANCE OF ALL THAT I I THOUGHT I'D RISE TO SHARE THAT STORY WITH YOU BECAUSE THIS IS FRESH. PROBABLY GOOD FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT. RIGHT MY DOCTOR WOULD PROBABLY RECOMMEND. THAT I'D LET THIS OUT RIGHT. BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A LESSON TO BE LEARNED FROM ALL OF THE STORIES WE HEARD HERE. ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR TODAY. AND I TO SUPPORT AJ ARE FORTY SIX AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU MISTER GARCIA. MR MACE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. OUR EYES THE SUPPORT THIS A RESOLUTION AS WELL. I USUALLY DON'T GET UP TO SPEAK ON I RESOLUTIONS I THINK THIS MIGHT BE MY FIRST SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT I HADN'T SEEN ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN STAND IN. I WENT OUT THE MEMBER FOR RANCHO CORDOVA SPOKE ABOUT A REAGAN SPEECH IN HIS FINAL YEAR FINAL SPEECH HE GAVE OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE ABOUT THE CITY ON A HILL. ONE OF MY FAVORITE PASSAGES -- FROM A FROM REAGAN YOU KNOW AMERICA HAS BEEN THIS BEACON OF HOPE AND FREEDOM PEOPLE OF COURSE WANT TO COME HERE BECAUSE WE ARE AN AMAZING COUNTRY. AND WE ARE AMAZING COUNTRY BECAUSE WE ARE GOOD THERE'S THAT LINE THAT SAYS THAT WE ARE GREAT BECAUSE WE ARE GOOD. AND WE SPEAK OF OF OF HUMAN VALUES AND WHAT IS THAT WHAT OUR HUMAN VALUES WILL. OFFER SOME OF US IS THAT JUDEO CHRISTIAN. OF VALUE AYE GREW UP ON A IN -- IN A HOME AND WENT TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNINGS WAS TO SING A SONG. JESUS LOVES THE LITTLE. TOO DURAN. ALL OF THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD. RED AND YELLOW BLACK AND WHITE THEY ARE PRECIOUS IN HIS SIGHT. JESUS LOVES THE LITTLE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD. THAT'S WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. THAT'S WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS LET'S NOT FORGET THAT A SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE RESOLUTION. MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES WHO WHO GOT UP AND TOLD PERSONAL STORIES AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. UP WHO REMINDS US. BUT THIS ISN'T PARTISAN NATIONAL. I'M IT'S VERY PERSONAL ISSUED A LOT OF US BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE A PARTISAN ISSUE. I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO FEEL LIKE DESPITE MY PERSONAL FEELINGS ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT THAT THIS IS. ANTI TRUMP THIS IS ANTI A POLICY A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY THAT DOES NOT ALIGN ITSELF. WITH OUR COUNTRY. AND IN PRACTICE IS NOT FEASIBLE. AS A WAY TO ENACT IMMIGRATION POLICY. I THINK EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS WHO SIGNED ON AS CO AUTHORS TO THIS RESOLUTION I'VE NEVER SEEN A RESOLUTION ACTUALLY COME TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT MANY [inaudible] CO AUTHORS. AND I DON'T WANNA PUT MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN A BAD SPOT NOT GONNA OPEN -- THE ROLE FOR ADDITIONAL CO AUTHORS. BUT I HOPE THAT SOME OF YOU CAN. FOLLOW THE LEAD. MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM SPRINGS AN ADD ON TO MAKE THIS A TRULY BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION. BECAUSE IN REALITY THE VERY SIMPLE FACT OF HAVING AN IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT SAYS ZERO TOLERANCE. CUTS OFF A VERY LEGAL PRACTICE AND THAT'S ONE OF PEOPLE FLEEING FROM. WAR TORN COUNTRIES. COUNTRIES THAT OFTEN WE CREATED THE SITUATION BY WHICH THEY HAVE TO LEAVE. IN ORDER SEEK ASYLUM HERE FOR THEM IN THEIR CHILDREN. A PRACTICE THAT HAS. BEEN ACCEPTED FOR GENERATIONS. AND A PULL PEOPLE EN IMAGEN PART OF AMERICA. WITHOUT SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THESE PARENTS WITHOUT INCARCERATING THE ENTIRE FAMILY. I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AND I THINK WE CAN ONLY DO BETTER IF WE DO IT TOGETHER.
