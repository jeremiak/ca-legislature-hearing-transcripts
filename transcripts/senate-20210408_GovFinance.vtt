00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.815
AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE

00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:38.949
CURRENT PENALTIES ARE SIMPLY

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:40.351
NOT DETERRING WATER THEFT THEY

IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. WATER

WITHOUT A PERMIT. IT PENALTIES

00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:56.667
FALL FAR BELOW WHAT IT WOULD

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:58.702

00:43:58.769 --> 00:43:59.870
THE NEED TO DETER THE STRANGE

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:05.976
THESE PENALTIES ARE NOT TOWARDS

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:07.144
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE JUST TRYING

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.178

00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:14.852
STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE

00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:17.087

THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO HOPE

THAT WE WOULD GET LOTS OF

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:47.957
REVENUE FROM IT. AND WE OFTEN

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:49.258
SEE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.227
DECRIMINALIZE. BUT WHAT

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:53.896
UNFORTUNATELY IS A KURD IS THAT

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.898
WE DO IN WHILE WE HAVE MANY.

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:57.433
BUSINESSES THAT ARE FOLLOWING

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:01.904
THE RULES. THAT GOT LICENSED.

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:02.405
THAT ARE COMPLYING WITH

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:04.674
EVERYTHING. WE STILL HAVE ABOUT

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.077
A THIRD. OR RATHER THEIR ONLY A

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.379
THIRD. OF CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:12.381
GOVERNMENTS OR JURISDICTIONS

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:14.617
THAT HAVE LEGAL BUSINESSES

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:17.587
OPERATING. NOW AS WE KNOW HOW

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:18.588
LONG WE HAD AN ILLEGAL

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:20.590
BUSINESS. THE LEAGUE ILLEGAL

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.925
BUSINESS IS THRIVING. ANSWER

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:26.095
RIGHT NOW THAT ILLEGAL CANNABIS

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:29.198
BUSINESS IS ESTIMATED IN TWENTY

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.766
NINETEEN TO HAVE A VALUE OF

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.368
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. THE L.

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:34.537
A- PUTS THE VALUE OF OUR LEGAL

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.539
MARKET. ONLY AT THREE POINT

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:39.442
THREE. SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL.

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:42.278
THE GOOD BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.113
COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIREMENTS.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.615
IT REALLY YOU START TO THINK

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:49.285
WHY SHOULD I HAVE. AND SO WE

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.587
REALLY WANT TO. HELLO WE WANT

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.789
TO SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE THE

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:55.858
LEGAL BUSINESS AND ONE OF THE

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.960
WAYS TO DO IT IS ONE OF THE

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:00.096
REASONS THAT LOCALITIES HAVE

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:03.065
NOT EITHER ALLOWED. LEGAL

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:05.201
BUSINESSES OR SO IS BECAUSE THE

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:07.136
PROPOSITION SET UP A VERY

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:09.672
COMPLICATED LOCAL LICENSING

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:12.375
REGIME WHICH SOME LOCALITIES

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.377
ARE JUST EITHER DO NOT HAVE THE

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:16.846
RESOURCES FOR. OR YOU KNOW WHAT

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:19.015
WE FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY DID

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.417
NOT WANT TO SET UP THAT. REGIME

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:23.786
HOWEVER THEY'RE NOT OPPOSED TO

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.821
HAVING A LEGAL BUSINESS OPERATE

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:27.356
SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.592
CREATE THE ABILITY FOR THE

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:31.827
LOCALITY TO OPT IN TO THE STATE

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:33.596
SYSTEM SO THE STATE COULD GIVE

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.765
THE LICENSE. NOW IF YOU THE

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:36.866
LOCALITY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO

01:05:36.932 --> 01:05:38.267
WANT TO OPT IN IF YOU CAN'T GET

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:40.736
ANY MONEY FROM THAT AND SO

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.104
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO FIX THE

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:44.840
PART THAT MR REQUIRE THE CHAIR

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:45.441

THE LOCAL ENTITY TO OPERATE IN

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:02.425
THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. IT

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.126

PLEASE I'M JUST. CURIOUS HERE-

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:28.637
THE STATE IS CURRENTLY

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:34.076
LICENSING- STRAIGHT. I MEAN.

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:34.676

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:37.979
FROM THE STATE. IS THAT IS THAT

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:40.015
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THERE IS

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:42.617
THE OPTIONS YES THERE IS THE

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:45.487
ABILITY FOR- AS LONG AS THE

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:49.524
LOCALITY DOES NOT OBJECT SO

01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:51.126
THERE IS ALREADY THAT ABILITY

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:53.495
BUT OF COURSE IN THOSE CASES

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:57.899
THE- LOCALITY GETS NO REVENUE.

01:18:57.966 --> 01:19:01.603
AND SO WE HAVE IN WE HAVE A

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:02.938
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THERE ARE

01:19:03.004 --> 01:19:05.207
THERE ARE LOCALITIES WHO HAVE

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:07.742
NOT SET UP. THEIR LICENSING

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:10.545
STRUCTURE BECAUSE OF ITS

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:13.315
COMPLICATION BUT WHO WANT TO

01:19:13.381 --> 01:19:15.484
HAVE LEGAL BUSINESSES AND OF

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:16.485
COURSE WANT TO SHARE IN THE

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:19.421
REVENUE SO THIS IS THIS BILL

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:21.623
WOULD CREATE THAT ABILITY I

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:22.791
JUST ONE MORE QUESTION IF I

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:25.961
CAN- HOW WOULD. HOW DO YOU KNOW

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:29.965
HOW IF THOSE LOCAL AREAS ARE

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:31.099
REALLY GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:33.768
OF THIS I MEAN IT IS THE JUST A

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.403
GUESS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM HAVE

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.807
SAID SO OR DO WE REALLY HAVE

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:42.043
SOME RELIABLE EXPECTATION-

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:44.079
INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE OF

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.280
COURSE MY STAFF AND I HAVE

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:47.649
DISCUSSED THAT A LOT BECAUSE

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:49.251
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO. GO TO THE-

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:50.418
TROUBLE PUTTING SOMETHING

01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:52.654
COMPLICATED INTO PLACE IF IT

01:19:52.721 --> 01:20:03.498
DID NOT GET. UTILIZED NOW IF

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:06.067
THE LOWER. CAN RECOVER NO. IT

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:07.369
IS LIKELY IT WON'T YOU- SO

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:08.336
THAT'S WHY .COM SO IMPORTANT

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:10.605
AND WE'RE ON IT- HOWEVER I CAN.

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:13.108
RIGHT NOW. WE WITH THIS PANDA

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:15.544
INDUCED RECESSION. AND KNOWING

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:17.179
THAT AT LEAST BRICK AND MORTAR

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:18.480
THERE SOME LEVEL OF BRICK OR

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:20.282
MORTAR TYPE OF OPERATIONS THAT

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.317
ARE NOT GOING TO COME BACK AND

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:24.886
WHILE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:27.355
COLLECT SALES TAX FROM INTERNET

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:30.458
SALES. IT'S NOW IF FOR EXAMPLE

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:31.993
OF THE AMAZON WAREHOUSES YOU

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.762
KNOW SHOW MORE FAR AWAY THAN

01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:35.497
THAT LOCAL JURISDICTION DOESN'T

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:37.766
GET EVEN IF YOU YOUR YOU BUY

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.334
THE PRODUCT OR WHATEVER SO

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:41.036
POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT OUR

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:42.971
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REVENUES HAVE

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:46.107
REALLY BEEN HURT. AND SO THEY

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:48.843
MADE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEYSEE

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:52.681
THE VALUE OF. THAT WILL THAT

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.115
THREE DOLLARS OUT OF EVERY FOUR

01:20:54.182 --> 01:20:55.684
DOLLARS SPENT ON CANNABIS IN

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:56.718
THE STATE IS BEING SPENT

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:58.453

AMENDMENTS ARE. COMING FORWARD

02:12:00.812 --> 02:12:01.847
FOR THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:12:01.913 --> 02:12:06.885
RAISED BUT I TO HAVE- LARA. OF

02:12:06.952 --> 02:12:09.488
CONCERNS ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND

02:12:09.554 --> 02:12:12.291
THE AND THE PERCENTAGES OF WHAT

02:12:12.357 --> 02:12:16.962
WILL BE- LOW. VERY LOW INCOME

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:20.365
AND HIGHER. UP PERCENTAGE FOR

02:12:20.432 --> 02:12:22.701
MODERATE INCOME HIGHER

02:12:22.768 --> 02:12:23.235
PERCENTAGE BUT IT WOULDN'T

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:27.773
INCLUDE MODERATE- AND I DON'T

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:28.707
WANT TO REPEAT WHAT EVERYBODY

02:12:28.774 --> 02:12:32.411
ELSE HAS SAID BUT IN A- THIS IS

02:12:32.477 --> 02:12:35.847
THIS WAS- PUBLIC LAND. I THINK

02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:38.283
THAT'S THE CONSIDERATION WHICH

02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:39.918
IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM YOU

02:12:39.985 --> 02:12:41.520
KNOW AN ENTIRELY PRIVATE

02:12:41.586 --> 02:12:45.557
SECTOR- SITUATION WHERE WE

02:12:45.624 --> 02:12:48.026
NEED. ON ONE WEEK I UNDERSTAND

02:12:48.093 --> 02:12:50.862
THE ISSUE PENCILING OUT- IS

02:12:50.929 --> 02:12:53.065
MUCH HARDER. BUT IN THIS CASE

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:58.103
IT'S PUBLIC LAND- SO. I GUESS I

02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:00.238
WOULD SUPPORT IT BUT I WOULD

02:13:00.305 --> 02:13:04.109
REALLY. BURJEEL AND NEED YOU TO

02:13:04.176 --> 02:13:05.777
CONTINUE TO PUSH IN THE

02:13:05.844 --> 02:13:07.546
DIRECTION OF A HIGHER

02:13:07.612 --> 02:13:11.149
PERCENTAGE. ESPECIALLY FOR

02:13:11.216 --> 02:13:14.019
LOWER OR VERY LOW OR AT LEAST

02:13:14.086 --> 02:13:15.087
YOU KNOW THAT THE TWENTY

02:13:15.153 --> 02:13:18.757
PERCENT- THAT SAYS FOR LOW OR

02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:21.760
MODERATE MEANS THAT THE ENTIRE

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:23.862
20% COULD GO TO MODERATE ABOUT

02:13:23.929 --> 02:13:26.064
RIGHT AND I AND THAT'S I THINK

02:13:26.131 --> 02:13:28.166
THE PART THAT BOTHERS ME THE

02:13:28.233 --> 02:13:30.068
MOST IS THAT THAT'S WHERE WE

02:13:30.135 --> 02:13:32.337
COULD END UP SO I DIDN'T QUITE

02:13:32.404 --> 02:13:34.940
CATCH EVERYTHING THAT- YOUR-

02:13:35.006 --> 02:13:37.075
SUPPORTERS ARE EXPERT WITNESSES

02:13:37.142 --> 02:13:39.010
SAID- BUT THAT'S THE BOTTOM

02:13:39.077 --> 02:13:40.846
LINE HERE WITH ME AND I. I

02:13:40.912 --> 02:13:43.348
REALLY BROUGH JUDE TO ADDRESS

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:45.417
THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY THANK

02:13:45.484 --> 02:13:46.385
YOU SENAOR OTHERS THOUGH I

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:49.588
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND-

02:13:49.654 --> 02:13:50.188
TEN SENATOR WIENER'S POINT WE

02:13:50.255 --> 02:13:52.724

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:54.159
STOCK WITH THE CITY TESTING TO

02:13:54.226 --> 02:13:56.061
TRY TO INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS I

02:13:56.128 --> 02:13:57.195
THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS

02:13:57.262 --> 02:13:58.430
THERE SO MANY DIFFERENT PARCELS

02:13:58.497 --> 02:13:59.364
TO BE DEVELOPED AND IT'S JUST

02:13:59.431 --> 02:14:01.600
ABOUT FINDING FINANCING- BUT I

02:14:01.666 --> 02:14:03.702
THINK- I DON'T PUT WORDS IN

02:14:03.769 --> 02:14:05.270
MAYOR CLARK'S MOUTH BUT BUT I

02:14:05.337 --> 02:14:06.972
BELIEVE WE'RE PREPARED TODAY.

02:14:07.038 --> 02:14:10.409
TO COMMIT 215% AGGREGATE LOW

02:14:10.475 --> 02:14:12.744
VERY LOW AND EXTREMELY LOW SO

02:14:12.811 --> 02:14:14.579
15% OF THE ADVOCATE UNITS

02:14:14.646 --> 02:14:16.915
BUILT- GOING FORWARD WOULD BE

02:14:16.982 --> 02:14:19.217
IN THAT CATEGORY- AND SO IT

02:14:19.284 --> 02:14:20.952
WOULD NOT BE AS YOU RAISE THE

02:14:21.019 --> 02:14:22.888
CONCERN LIKE 20% JUST ALL IN

02:14:22.954 --> 02:14:24.456
THAT MODERATE RANGE 15% AT

02:14:24.523 --> 02:14:29.127
LEAST WOULD BE LOW VERY LOW AND

02:14:29.194 --> 02:14:29.728
EXTREMELY LOW IS THAT CORRECT.

02:14:29.795 --> 02:14:31.463
