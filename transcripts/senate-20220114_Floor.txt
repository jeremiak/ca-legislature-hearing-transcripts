TOM LOGGER TO RECOGNIZE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR WHO DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO NON VIOLENT STRUGGLE FOR RACIAL EQUALITY IN UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THE LATE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS BORN ON JANUARY FIFTEENTH NINETEEN TWENTY NINE IN ATLANTA GEORGIA. THIS YEAR WOULD HAVE BEEN DR KING'S NINETY THIRD BIRTHDAY AND WE WERE HONORED TO HAVE. HIS COLLEAGUE REVEREND LAWSON WHO IS CELEBRATING NINETY THREE YEARS OF. STRUGGLE AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT WITH US THIS PAST WEDNESDAY AT THE MARTIN LUTHER KING CELEBRATION. IT'S BEEN NEARLY FIFTY FORTY YEARS SINCE DR KING WAS ASSASSINATED ON APRIL FOURTH NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. IN MEMPHIS TENNESSEE. DR KING CHARLES WORK DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE PASSAGE OF THE LANDMARK CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS A COURAGEOUS MAN WHO DID NOT SIMPLY TALK THE TALK BUT WAS WILLING TO DIE. BY HIS MORALS AND HIS CONVICTION. WITHOUT DR KING'S DETERMINATION RESILIENCE I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE HERE IN THIS POSITION AND I SAID AS I STAND HERE TODAY IN FRONT OF EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. NEITHER WOULD PROBABLY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. DR KING'S COURAGE AND RESILIENCE HAS INSPIRED AND MOTIVATED GENERATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE. AND MANY LIKE ME TO GROW UP WHO GREW UP DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. ONE ZERO WE HAD THE PLEASURE AGAIN OF HOSTING THE BLACK CAUCUSES M. OKAY BREAKFAST AND I HOPE WE WERE ALL LEFT INSPIRED BY THOSE WHO CAME TO JOIN US IN HONORING THE WORK OF THIS GREAT MAN. AND STATED WE WERE JOINED BY REVEREND LAWSON WHO WAS AS DR KING'S RIGHT HAND MAN DURING MOST OF THE STRUGGLES. FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND IF YOU MISS IT I ASKED YOU TO CHECK OUT FACEBOOK OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND I PROMISE YOU YOU WILL BE BY WHAT WAS THERE. AS REFLECT ON HIGH WE HE PERMANENTLY CHANGE OUR COUNTRY WITH HIS IDEALS WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THIS. VISION IS NOT YET COMPLETE. TO TRULY PAID TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE AND WORK OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. AND ALL THAT HE HAS DONE TO. MATERIALIZE HIS VISION OF HAVING A MORE JUST AND EQUAL SOCIETY. WE MUST. HAVE THE WILL AND APPETITE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. DOCTOR KING ONCE SAID THE TIME IS ALWAYS RIGHT. TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. CALLING TO TIME TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT IS NOW OUR DEMOCRACY OUR STATE OUR NATION DEPENDS ON IT. IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU ALONE TO GET INTO SOME GOOD TROUBLE WE ALL NEED TO GET INTO GOOD TROUBLE. WE HAVE TO GALVANIZE AND EMPOWER OUR FAMILIES FRIENDS AND COMMUNITIES TO JOIN US IN THIS EFFORT. WE MUST HONOR DR MARTIN LUTHER KING'S LEGACY WHAT ACTION WITH VOTES AND SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER. IT IS OUR MANDATE TO HIS LEGACY TO CREATE POSITIVE CHANGE WHICH TAKES US CLOSER STEP BY STEP TO REALIZING CIVIL RIGHTS SOCIAL JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR NATION IS NOT ENOUGH NEW BOOK HIS WORDS AND HIS NAME AND DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. THE NIGHT BEFORE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS ASSASSINATED HE AND HIS FELLOW. COMRADES RAYMOND JAMES LAWSON WERE IN TOWN TO HELP ORGANIZE A STRIKE FOR THIRTEEN HUNDRED BLOCK SANITATION WORKERS ELEVEN DAYS AFTER TO MEMPHIS GARBAGE COLLECTORS APPLE COLE AND ROBERT WALKER WERE CRUSHED TO DEATH IN A MANUFACTURING TRUCK. DR KING'S LAST SPEECH I'VE BEEN TO THE MOUNTAINTOP HE SAID WE GOT TO GIVE OURSELVES TO THIS STRUGGLE UNTIL THE END NOTHING WOULD BE MORE TRAGIC THAN TO STOP AT THIS POINT IN MEMPHIS. WE GOT TO SEE THIS THROUGH. I ASKED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARE YOU PREPARED TO SEE THIS FIGHT THROUGH. THE FIGHT NOT ONLY TO RESTORE OUR DEMOCRACY WE HAVE COME TO KNOW BUT TO ENVISION A DEMOCRACY FOR ALL MEN AND WOMEN REGARDLESS OF COLOR RACE CREED ARE. TREATED EQUAL N. AFFORDED THE FULL PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY I BELIEVE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULD WANT US TO MAKE A DETERMINED. FOR TEN DURING ANY AND ALL CHALLENGES IF IT MEANT REALIZING THE DREAM FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS AS LAWMAKERS CITIZENS AND THIS NATION. I ASSURE YOU THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS IT'S TIME TO SEE THIS FIGHT FOR EQUALITY AND JUSTICE THROUGH I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US IN THIS EFFORT BY COMING TOGETHER TO HONOR DR MARTIN LUTHER KING AND BY FIGHTING.

THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SENATORS I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS YOU ARE SIXTY TWO AND A HALF AS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. I'M HONORED TO RICE TO CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. DR KING FOUGHT FOR INCLUSIVE INCLUSIVITY AND EQUALITY AND FACTORS- MY GOOD FRIEND- FROM LOS ANGELES SAID MANY OF US. WILL PROBABLY NOT EVEN BE SERVING HERE IN THIS CHAMBER IT WAS NOT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS LIKE DR KING ARE THE REASON WE HAVE MANY OF THE RIGHTS WE ENJOY TODAY. N. ARE THE INSPIRATION FOR CONTINUING TO FIGHT. TO ACHIEVE EQUALITY EQUAL RIGHTS FOR EVERY AMERICAN. MANY ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUTERS BELIEVING CONTINUE BELIEVE AND MARTIN LUTHER KING'S DREAM. FEW EXAMPLES GRACE LEE BOGGS COLLABORATED WITH DOCTOR CAME TO ORGANIZED IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WHAT THE FREEDOM IN DETROIT AND RICHARD OKEY OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE WHO JOINED CHARLIE BROWN OF THE AMERICAN AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENT UNION. AND MANUEL DELGADO THE MEXICAN AMERICAN STUDENT CONFEDERATION BELIEVED TO LEAD THE THIRD WORLD LIBERATION FRONT IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE LEADERSHIP AND SACRIFICE OF BLACK AMERICANS. TO ACHIEVE A MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE. AMERICA AND THE AMA ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY STANDS IN SOLIDARITY LAST YEAR WE EXPERIENCED IN THE SPIKE IN ANTI ASIAN HATE CRIMES WE KNOW THAT WELL CERTAINLY OUR COMMUNITY DID EXPERIENCE THIS THAT WAS NOT SOLELY LIMITED TO. ASIAN AMERICANS THAT ACTUALLY ALL COMMUNITY COLOR EXPERIENCE INCREASE HEY. AND WE APPRECIATE THE SOLIDARITY OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO STOP HATE AGAINST OUR COMMUNITIES. MARTIN LUTHER KING AN INSPIRATION TO ALL AMERICANS PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING S. C. R. SIXTY TWO AND COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO WORK DREAM INTO A REALITY THERE'S MUCH WORK TO DO. I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. R. SIXTY TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR PANEL GO TO SENATOR EDMUND FOLLOWED BY SENATOR SKINNER CENTER AT. THANK YOU- I AM PROUD TO RISE ON BEHALF OF S. C. R. SIXTY TWO ON BEHALF OF THE LGBT CAUCUS. WE ALL KNOW WHAT DR MARTIN LUTHER KING DEAD AND HE'S BEEN A PERSONAL HERO CERTAINLY FOR ME AND FOR MANY IN THIS ROOM AND AS IS ALREADY BEEN STATED MANY OF US WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE. WITHOUT THE STAND HE TOOK. ON THE MOVEMENT HE HELPED CREATE AND CERTAINLY HELP SHEPHERD. INTO ALL OF OUR REALIZATIONS. I THINK SOMETIMES WE FORGET ABOUT THE CONTEXT IN WHICH ALL OF THAT OCCURRED. THERE WAS ANOTHER A DEATH THIS WEEK OF A AT ANOTHER OF HIS CITY PORT J. AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU I GREW UP WATCHING SIDNEY PORTIER MOVIES AND LOVING THEM. EVER WATCHING WITH WITH AUDREY. IN THE BEAUTY- AND FOR MANY PEOPLE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD SEEN AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTOR AS AN EQUAL ON THE SCREEN WITH EVERYBODY ELSE NOT PLAYING A SUBSERVIENT ROLE. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND I WATCH THIS I REMEMBER WATCHING IT WITH MY THIRTEEN YEAR ALL EYES AND THEN I WATCHED IT WITH MY DAUGHTER WITH HER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD I. AND AS A AS A YOUNG CHILD- OF COLOR. IN AND HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO HER ONE YOU SAW I MEAN CITY FORTUNE WAS SO FAMOUS BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO HOLD. HIS GRADES HE WAS ABLE TO NOT REACT. AS THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS IN A IN A SITUATION AS THE AS IF THE FIRST AND THE ONLY WHEN HE WAS. EITHER IS IT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THEY CALL ME SIR OR CALL ME MISTER TIBBS. ALL OF THOSE FILMS. WHERE WE SAW THAT HE WOULD JUST. TAKE AN INSULT. AND NOT REACT. BUT CERTAINLY NOT LET IT BE OKAY. AND THAT WAS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS DOING THIS ORGANIZING. WERE FOR SO MANY IT WAS A PLACE THEY COULDN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE. BUT FOR SO MANY WHO WERE BRAVE WHO KNOWS- EQUALITY WAS WAS BETTER FOR ALL OF US. THAT AWARENESS AND VISIBILITY WAS BETTER FOR ALL OF US AT THE MORE INTEGRATED WE COULD BE. THEN THE MORE THAT WE COULD SEE THAT WE ARE SO MORE. ALIKE THAN WE ARE DIFFERENT. AND THAT'S WHAT DR MARTIN LUTHER KING STOOD FOR RIGHT THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE OUR PLACE THAT WE CAN ALL BE SEEN THAT IT IS NOT SCARY. FOR US TO BE DIFFERENT. HE WAS A REVERENT OF JUSTICE VERSUS A REVERENT OF. EXCLUSION HE WAS SOMEONE WHO. TAUGHT US ABOUT THAT IDEAL AND TRY TO LEAD US TO JUSTICE. RATHER THAN LEADING US INTO DIVISION INTO OUR CORNERS. IF WE CAN REMEMBER ANYTHING AS WE HONOR HIS BIRTH. TO REMEMBER HIS LEGACY. AND REMEMBER THE CONTEXT IN THE BRAVERY IT TOOK DURING THAT TIME. TO CONTINUE TO SAY. WE ARE ALL THE SAME. AND UNTIL WE ALL LINK ARMS AND MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER WILL REMAIN DIVIDED AND ANGRY IN OUR CORNERS SO LET US TAKE NEW HEART TODAY. AS WE KNOW THE PROGRESS WE'VE SEEN THE PROGRESS WE LOOK BACK IN TIME YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRESS AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH MORE TO GO. AS WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH OUR OWN IDENTITIES AS AMERICANS. LET US INTEGRATE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING'S WORDS AND HIS VISION AND ALL OF THOSE WHO CRAVE TO BE VISIBLE AND TAKE THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACE. SO THAT WE CAN TRULY CREATE THAT GARMENT. THAT WRAPS US ALL IN ITS DESTINY I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. ON S. C. R. SIXTY TWO WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR WIENER SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU FIVE MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF S. C. R. SIXTY TWO. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS NOT A ONE DIMENSIONAL LEADER. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND EQUALITY WAS MULTI DIMENSIONAL THAT IT WAS INTERSECTIONAL. FULLY INTERSECTION WITH THE STRUGGLE FOR FULL HUMAN RIGHTS ECONOMIC. JUSTICEECONOMIC EQUALITY WORKER DIGNITY AND JUSTICE WITHIN OUR CRIMINAL IN PORCHESTER. HE WAS AN INNOVATOR OF NONVIOLENT MOVEMENT BUILDING AND HIS LEADERSHIP WAS PIVOTAL DURINGA DIFFICULT TIME IN OUR NATION A TIME WHERE WE WERE OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING GREAT SOCIAL UPHEAVAL WHEN WE FACED A LOT OF CONTRADICTIONS IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO TODAY. ONE OF THE GREAT MARKS OF HIS LEADERSHIP WAS HIS FIERCE URGENCY. AND ONE OF THE QUOTES OF HIS THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. IT IS NOT JUST% INSPIRED BY BUT MOTIVATED EACH DAY BYE WAS WHEN H SAID WE ARE NOW FACED WITH THE FACT THAT TOMORROW IS TODAY WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW. IN THIS UNFOLDING CONUNDRUM OF LIFE IN HISTORY THERE IS SUCH A THING AS BEING TOO LATE THERE IS NO TIME FOR APATHY OR COMPLACENCY THIS IS A TIME FOR VIGOROUS AND POSITIVE ACTION. AS WE HONOR DR KING I HOPE THAT WE HEED THOSE WORDS AND THAT WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO VIGOROUS AND POSITIVE ACTION. FOR CIVIL RIGHTS VOTING RIGHTS. ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND GENDER AND RACIAL EQUITY. AND THAT WE MEET THE URGENCY OF NOW SO THAT WE MAKE EACH DAY WORTHY OF DR KING'S DREAM AND I THINK ALL OF OUR DREAMS. THANK YOU.

WITH OUR BLACK BROTHERS AND SISTERS- AND THIS IS- IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ONE- THROUGHOUT SO MANY DIFFERENT- CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLES. ON IT'S ALSO- ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT DESPITE THE COMMON MISPERCEPTION THAT- THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IS ENTIRELY WHITE THAT'S NOT TRUE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER O JEWS OF COLOR PARTICULARLY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF. A BLACK SHOES AND SERVICE THESE COMMUNITIES- I HAVE INCREDIBLE- OVERLAP AND WE ALWAYS HAVE TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH ONE ANOTHER- AND THAT OF COURSE CONTINUES TODAY. AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK- TO UNRAVEL AND STRUCTURAL RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. WHETHER IT'S ENDING MASS INCARCERATION- WHETHER IT IS PREVENTING- THE REOCCURRENCE OF INCREDIBLE- WITH. EXTRA TENS OF BUT- UNFORTUNATELY AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND IS A TO CPAS TO IN FRANCE. BLACK PEOPLE ARE FROM. VOTING IT'S NOT A QUICK. THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT- WHERE THE ATTACKS ON VOTING RIGHTS IN THE% TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION HAPPENED- THE ATTACKS AND ACCUSATIONS WERE IN WHITE COMMUNITIES IT WAS IN BLACK COMMUNITIES IN PLACES LIKE PHILADELPHIA. OR CLEVELAND OR- OTHER AREAS WHERE WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT BLACK COMMUNITY- SO WE NEED TO ALWAYS KEEP THAT IN MIND AND REMEMBER THAT DR KING'S WORK IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING DONE THANK YOU.

AS MY FIRST EXAMPLE OF THE BLACKGROUND SOLIDARITY THAT WE'VE SEEN- THAT HAS RESONATED FOR MANY MANY DECADES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND THAT WE'VE SEEN SO PRIVATE- PREVALENCE NOW AS WE SEE SO MANY MOVEMENTS THAT THAT HAPPENED- IN THE MOST RECENT TIMES.

A BROTHER OR SISTER FAMILY MEMBER A GOOD FRIEND THAT THEY'RE STILL WITH US HE'S WITH US RIGHT NOW HE'S WITH US SHE'S WITH US WE ALWAYS SAY THAT. WHAT DR MARTIN LUTHER KING I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU YOU'RE STILL WITH US. AND IF WE TURN THE CLOCK BACK I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU WE LOST YOU A GREAT AMERICAN. BUT YOU DAVIS LEADERSHIP YOU GAVE US A VOICE MINORITIES ACROSS THE BOARD. I RISE AS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO CAUCUS SUNRISE IS THE- CHAIR OF THE MILITARY VETERANS COMMITTEE. TO SHARE WITH YOU DR MARTIN LUTHER KING THAT IT WAS YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE DOORS THAT YOU KEPT OPEN. FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IT'S BEEN A SLOW STRUGGLE. BUT WE WOULDN'T BE WHERE WE'RE AT WITHOUT YOUR VOICE WITHOUT YOUR MOVEMENT INCLUSION FAIRNESS EQUALITY. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WE'RE NOT DONE. BUT I WILL TELL YOU WE'VE MADE STRIDES RIGHT NOW. MILITARY ACADEMY WEST POINT. THE NAVAL ACADEMY HAS TWO SUPERINTENDENTS AFRICAN AMERICANS BOTH OF A- THREE STAR GENERALS ADMIRALS. YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR LEADERSHIP THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN ARE PROGRESSING BEING PROMOTED AND ACKNOWLEDGED FOR THEIR WORK THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR SKILL. AND THAT IS ACROSS THE BOARD AND ALL MINORITIES. EVERYONE SHOW WHEN I THINK OF THE WORK YOU'VE DONE WITH I THINK THE WORK YOU'RE STILL DOING. THAT I'VE GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS COUNTRY IS BETTER BECAUSE OF YOU. YOU WERE MISSED YOUR GREAT LOSS AND WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU. WE WILL CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE AS AMERICANS MELTED TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED EQUALITY WHERE NO ONE WOULD LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND BE ABLE TO SAY YOU'RE DIFFERENT YOU'RE DIFFERENT NO. WE'RE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN AND DR MARTIN LUTHER KING THANK YOU FOR TO GET THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU SIR ARCHULETA CENTER WAS SO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS IT'S MY PLEASURE. TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS YOU ARE SIXTY TWO. WHICH COMMEMORATES THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE REVEREND DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST- TRAGEDIES IS THAT WE'RE HERE TALKING. TODAY ABOUT A PERSON THAT IN THE- NINETEEN SIXTIES WAS A STRUGGLING FOR EQUAL RIGHTS AND CIVIL CIVIL RIGHTS. PRACTICALLY A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. BASICALLY WAS DESIGNED TO GIVE AFRICAN CANCER RIGHT AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. AND BACK THEN THERE WERE LOTS OF BENEFITS THAT CAME FROM THAT THE ABILITY TO VOTE. AFRICAN AMERICANS GOT TO OWN THEIR OWN LAND AND TRY TO INTEGRATE AND IN SOCIETY. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT WAS AN ENTIRE MOVEMENT. THAT TOOK A HUNDRED YEARS THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY THE NIGHT TO PREVENT THEM THE VOTE. AND THE- ABILITY TO INTEGRATE IN SOCIETY HAVE THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. TO ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO GAVE RISE TO CLUE KLUX KLAN. THEY GAVE RISE TO SYMBOLS OF PEOPLE THAT ONCE WERE CONSIDERED TREASONOUS AND ONCE WERE CONSIDERED. TO BE TRIED FOR TREASON FOR THEIR CRIMES AGAINST. THE UNITED STATES IN THOSE SYMBOLS BECAME PERVASIVE IN THE SOUTH INCLUDING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG. GROWING UP I REMEMBER SEEING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG ON TELEVISION SHOWS. REMOTE INTO SOMETHING- A REPRESENTATIVE OF A PLACE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE- REMEMBERED WITH FOND MEMORIES OR ASSOCIATED WITH A VERY NEGATIVE CONCEPT MOST OF THOSE WERE VERY INTERESTING MARKETING- OR OR OR STRATEGIES TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S VIEWS ABOUT WHAT THE CIVIL WAR ACTUALLY WAS AND WHAT IT REPRESENTED. THERE WERE. THERE IF YOU ALL HEARD THE TERM CARPETBAGGER. CARPETBAGGERS WERE ACTUALLY PEOPLE THAT WENT TO THE SOUTH TO PROVIDE EDUCATION BUILD SCHOOLS HELP TO REBUILD THE SOUTH AND TO HELP BUILD HOUSING FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DISPLACED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY REPRESENTED RECONSTRUCTION THEY WERE VILIFIED AND OFTENTIMES TORTURED AND KILLED AND THAT TERM CARPETBAGGER CAME TO BE VIEWED AS SOMEBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT WASN'T WELCOME AND THAT WAS ORIGINATED IN THE SOUTH AND IT CAME TO SPEAK. ABOUT WHAT GREAT ABILITY THEY HAD TO INSTITUTIONALIZE. NEGATIVE THINGS INTO POSITIVE THINGS AND THAT GAVE RISE TO MARTIN LUTHER KING AND IT WAS. WHEN HE FACED EVERY MANNER OF DISCRIMINATION AND THREATS AGAINST HIS LIFE OFTENTIMES BEING PURSUED AND SEEN AS A THREAT BY HIS OWN. GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS A REMINDER TO US THAT EVEN IF SOMETHING HAPPENED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WERE FIFTY YEARS AGO. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE'S MINDS HAVE BEEN CHANGED AND THINGS HAVE IMPROVED FOR THE BETTER AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IS STILL UNDER ATTACK TODAY. IN PLACES LIKE TEXAS. NATIVE BUT THE CHILDREN OF FOREIGN BORN. IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING DENIED BIRTH CERTIFICATES IN A STATE WITH US SENATOR THAT WAS BORN OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY TO. THE WORK OF MARTIN LUTHER KING. AND HOW HIS LEG LEAST LEGACY STILL LIVES ON IT REMINDS US TO HAVE THE STRAIN FROM THE BACKBONE AND THE COURAGE. TO FIGHT. FOR WHAT IS RIGHT FOR WHAT WE THIS COUNTRY REALLY STANDS FOR. AND TO NOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR WHAT AMERICA IS REALLY ABOUT PERSON DR KING AND SYSTEMS CHAVEZ. WE WERE WE WERE CONNECTED TODAY HE WAS AN INSPIRATION DR KING INSPIRED MANY LATINO CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS- THE LOTUS WORD PROCESSORS CHAVEZ- HE ONCE SENT A TELEGRAM TO SOCIETY JARVIS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX IN SUPPORT OF LA WAITED ON SUPPORT OF THE STRUGGLE OF THE STRIKE. IN SUPPORT OF THE STRUGGLE TO TELEGRAM SAID AS BROTHERS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EQUALITY. I EXTEND A HAND OF FELLOWSHIP AND GOOD WILL. AND WISH YOU CONTINUING SUCCESS TO YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS THE FIGHT OF THE QUALITY MUST BE FOUGHT ON MANY FRONTS IN THE URBAN SLUMS IN THE SWEATSHOPS OF THE BREEZE FEELS ARE STRUCK SEPARATE STRUGGLES ARE REALLY A STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM DIGNITY AND HUMANITY. YOU AND YOUR VALIANT FELLOW WORKERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED YOUR COMMITMENT TO RIGHTING GRIEVOUS WRONGS FORCED UPON EXPLOITED PEOPLE. WE ARE TOGETHER WITH YOU IN SPIRIT AND IN THE DETERMINATION THAT OUR DREAMS FOR A BETTER TOMORROW. WILL BE REALIZED. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SIR WEST MANY PASSING WERE GONNA% RECOGNIZE SENATOR ACTIONS AND THEN SENATOR BRADFORD WILL PROVIDE HIS CLOTHES. SENATOR ACTIONS. MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THANK YOU I RISE TO JOIN THE SENATE IN COMMEMORATING AGAIN THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF RIVER DART DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR YOU KNOW THIS IS MY TWELFTH OPPORTUNITY- IN THE LEGISLATURE TO- HERE AND STAND IN RECOGNITION THIS GREAT MAN I HAVE TO TELL YOU I ACTUALLY THINK THIS YEAR FEELS DIFFERENT. WHICH IS WHY I CHOSE TOSTAND UP I IN PREVIOUS YEARS I'VE LISTENED I HAVEN'T ALWAYS SPOKEN BECAUSE SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE HAVE BEEN SO ELOQUENT. BUT I DO THINK THIS YEAR IS DIFFERENT AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE AFTER YEARS OF OUR SHARING HIS WORDS IN HONORING THE CAUSES THAT HE LIVED HE SERVED AND DIED FOR. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO KEEP MAKING REAL PROGRESS AND TO MOVE CLOSER. TOWARDS HIS GOALS AND WITH OUR VERY OWN HANDS HELP BEND THAT ARC. TO PUT TOWARDS JUSTICE. CLOSER TOWARDS JUSTICE WELL THERE'S STILL SO MUCH TO BE DONE AS HAS BEEN SAID BY NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES I BELIEVE AFTER YEARS OF GRINDING WORK TOWARDS PROGRESS A COUPLE OF EARTHQUAKES OCCURRED AND OPENED UP NEW PATHWAYS FOR US TO MAKE. MAJOR ADVANCES. THE TRAGEDIES OF GEORGE FLOYD AND BRIANNA TAYLOR AND SO MANY OTHERS TOO MANY OTHERS HAVE ALLOWED US TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON REFORMING OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE FIVE YEARS AGO TEN YEARS AGO TWELVE YEARS AGO. IN JANUARY OF NINETEEN FIFTY SIX AFTER MOVING HIS FAMILY INTO A PROJECT IN CHICAGO TO HIGHLIGHT RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HOUSING. DR KING WON CONCESSIONS FROM THE CITY. A VICTORY THAT HE CALLED THE FIRST STEP IN A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES. AS PART OF A DRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS WE HAVE TAKEN OUR OWN STEPS IN THEIR JOURNEY HOWEVER A BEGINNING. IN ELIMINATING BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT HAVE FACED IN FINDING THEIR OWN HOMES AND ALLOWING MORE FAMILIES TO START BUILDING WEALTH INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH pHEIRS. THIS PANDEMIC HAS SHINED A GLARINGLIGHT ON THE INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND EVEN AS WE CONTINUE ADDING MORE CALIFORNIANS TO OUR HEALTH CARE ROLES WE MUST ADDRESS THOSE INEQUITIES BOTH DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND BEYOND. IN FACT DEEPLY EXAMINING INEQUITIES HAS BECOME IN PART BECAUSE OF THESE EARTHQUAKES BECAUSE OF THESE HAPPENINGS. THAT I TALKED ABOUT. A CONSTANT PRIORITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE I BELIEVE AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE BILLS THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE SESSION MANY OF THEM AND BEYOND WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH A REAL LANDS OF EQUITY. BUT IT IS UP TO US TO MAKE SURE THAT CONTINUES TO BE TRUE. SO YES WHILE THERE IS A LOT OF HARD WORK YES TO DO. AND OTHER ISSUES CERTAINLY REMAIN. THIS YEAR REALLY DOES FEEL DIFFERENT TO ME OPPORTUNITY IF WE KEEP WORKING TOGETHER TO INSURE IT IS DIFFERENT IT IS DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN TRULY HONOR THE LIFE AND LEGACY AND CERTAINLY ADVANCE THAT LEGACY OF THE REVEREND DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. BUT IT'S ONLY IF WE KEEP IT IN FOCUS IT IS ONLY IF WE MAKE THAT COMMITMENT THAT WE CAN GROW ON SOME OF THE SUCCESSES THAT WE HAVE HAD. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SIR ACTIONS SENATOR BRADFORD YOU'RE RECOGNIZED TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO SINCERELY THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO STOOD UP THIS MORNING TO YOU. AT THE EARTH FOX THEIR WORDS THEIR HOPES THEIR BELIEFS AND SUPPORT. AND RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. AND I HOPE WE WALK AWAY WITH JUST NOT REMEMBERING THE WORDS BUT REALLY RE DEDICATING OURSELVES TO WHAT THIS MAN'S LIFE STOOD FOR AND WHAT HE DIED FOR. DR KING OFTEN STATED. OUR LIVES BEGIN TO END THE DAY WE BECOME SILENT ABOUT WHAT MATTERS MOST. MILITARY MEMBERS A LOT OF FOLKS LIVES ARE ENDING. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE SILENT ON JANUARY SIX THE LOT FOLKS WERE SILENT ON THE HOMELESSNESS IN THIS COUNTRY TO A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE SOLID ON THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT STILL EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY. HE OFTEN ALSO SAID WE WILL REMEMBER NOT THE WORDS OF OUR ENEMIES. BUT THE SILENCE OF OUR FRIENDS. WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY OF OUR FRIENDS WERE SILENT. WHEN WE SHOULD BE SPEAKING UP AND LETTING THE TRUTH BE HEARD. AND HE STAYED IT DOESN'T MATTER OW LONG YOU LIVE IT'S HOW WELL YOU LIVE HE LIVED ALL OF THIRTY NINE YEARS IT'S ONLY ONE MEMBER ON THIS FLOOR YOUNGER THAN THAT. AND LOOK AT THE IMPACT THAT HE MADE IN THIRTY NINE YEARS WHAT ARE YOU DOING MEMBERS. HE ALSO STATED WE'RE NOT MADE BY HISTORY. R. WE'RE NOT MAKERS OF HISTORY I SHOULD SAY WERE MADE BY HISTORY.

I ALSO RISE TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF A SYNTHESIS THAT NONE THIS. FOR MANY MEXICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES THE MUSIC OF THE CENTER BUTTON ON THIS OR CHANTING. AS HE WAS KNOWN TO FANS WAS THE SOUNDTRACK OF THEIR LIVES HIS MUSIC PLAYED AT BIRTHDAYS BAPTISMS FUNERALS HE'S IN YET AS AND EVEN CASUAL IMPROMPTU BACKYARD GATHERINGS. HIS VOICE WAS PART OF THEIR HOME AND HIS LYRICS LIVED DEEP IN THEIR HEARTS MAKING HIM A STAPLE IN HOMES ACROSS THE NATION. ALTHOUGH LESS KNOWN TO ENGLISH SPEAKING AUDIENCES HE CONSISTENTLY FILL STADIUMS AND VENUES THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BUT NONE THIS RECEIVED A STAR ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME. HE WON THREE GRAMMYS AND EIGHT LATIN GRAMMYS AMONG OTHER HONORS HE APPEARED IN MORE THAN THIRTY MOVIES AND SOLD MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION RECORDS. MAINTAINING THE WRENCH AND A TRADITION BUT NONE THIS ALWAYS PERFORM WE'RE WEARING THAT THAT I HAD A CHAT ROOM. THE CHARTER SUIT SUIT. OF MARIACHIS HE SANG ABOUT LOVE HEARTBREAK BETRAYAL AND HIS LOVE FOR MEXICO. AND WHAT THEY LEARNED THIS DIDN'T WRITE HIS SONGS. HE DELIVERED THEM WITH SUCH EMOTION AND HEART THEY NEVER BELIEVE BECAME HIS. FOR MANY. HE EMBODIED WHAT IT MEANT TO BE MEXICAN. THAT NUMBER IS REACHED MASSIVE SUCCESS IN THE SEVENTIES WITH THIS HITS PART OF IT WHAT ABOUT. WHICH TRANSLATES INTO RETURN RETURN. THIS SONG IS ABOUT RETURNING TO A LONG LOST LOVE. BUT FOR MANY FANS THE LAST CLUB WAS NOT A PERSON BUT A PLACE. THEIR HOMELAND OF MEXICO. FERNANDES COULD NOT BUILD HIS CAREER WITHOUT US FANS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY BOUGHT HIS RECORDS IN FIELD CONCERTS VENUES LIKE THE MILLION DOLLAR THEATER IN LOS ANGELES. WHERE MANY GATHERED TO EXPERIENCE THE CULTURE THROUGH THE FAMILY EARLY AGENDA SONGS AND EVENTUALLY BREAK ATTENDANCE RECORDS I DON'T REMEMBER AND SAY COMES ACROSS THE STATE. HIS MUSIC TELL THE BOARD MANY MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WERE FEELING. HELP THEM FORGET THEY WERE MILES AWAY. FROM THEIR HOMETOWNS AND LOVED ONES AND VALIDATED THEIR EXISTENCE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT HIS SONGS TRAVEL THE PARALLEL TO THE LAGS MANY MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WERE EXPERIENCING. HE SAID ABOUT PRIDE IN PAIN BUT MOSTLY. FOR MOST IMPORTANTLY HIS MUSIC ALLOWED HIS PANTS TO FEEL VULNERABLE TO CRY OVER LONG. LOST LOVE EARLY MORNING FOR HOME YOU KEEP APPLAUDING YOUR CHIN FACEBOOK STOPS IN. TODAY I CONTINUE TO APOLOGY THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC BUT ULTIMATELY SHAPED A GENERATION OF NOT ONLY MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS. ALL FANS. BLOODHOUND COMFORT IN YOUR VOICE HERE IN THE GREAT STATE THROUGH YOUR MUSIC FELT SEEN. YOUR LEGACY WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AS SECOND AND THIRD GENERATION OF DINOS CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO YOUR SONGS BECAUSE IT REMINDS THEM. ARE THEIR CHILDHOOD. ULTIMATELY CONTINUES TO BRIDGE GAPS AMONG THEIR OWN FAMILIES. OR SIMPLY RESTRICTED EITHER CHECK. THANK YOU SENATOR TROUBLED SENATOR MYSELF. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS FOR THEIR VERY MOVING SPEECHES HI. I JUST WANT I WANT TO THANK ALSO- FOR EVERYONE WANTING TO TURN THIS MEMORY I WASN'T. CAN I SPEAK BUT I WAS REALLY MOVED. HI EVERYONE SPEECHES I WAS VERY DEEPLY MOVED BECAUSE I THINK- THE CENTER FEB NINE THIS INSPIRED MANY PEOPLE TO BE STRONG. TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES IN LIFE WHETHER IT WAS POVERTY. OR LEAVING YOUR COUNTRY OR- OF. THE YOU KNOW OF LOVE. AND YEAH IT WAS IT'S HARD TO GO TO ANY EVENT WHETHER IT BE A MARRIAGE OR A FUNERAL OR KIDS AND YET I'M NOT HAVE HIS MUSIC THE FRONT AND CENTER. IN IN IN THAT EVENT. THE FIRST CHANCE OF THE FIRST UP TO I GOT A MEDIUM WHICH HAS HOME AND WHAT WE SENT THAT WOULD DO IS OPEN UP THOSE DOORS AND YOU HAD A BIG RANCH AND HE WAS VERY GENEROUS ABOUT LETTING ANYONE COME IN AND TOUR HIS PROPERTY. AND SEE HIS HORSES AND SEE HIS RANCH. AND WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM HE WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE. SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS TAKING PICTURES. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY. OF THAT LEVEL OF FAME. THAT WAS STILL WILLING TO ENGAGE SO CLOSELY. WITH THE WITH THE- THE PEOPLE OF HIS COMMUNITY. HE WOULD JUST OPEN UP THE DOORS AND LET THEM COME IN. AND I ASKED IS WHAT'S GOING ON THEY SAID ALL HE DOES THIS WHEN ONLY WHEN HE'S HOME. HE ALWAYS DOES. HE'S VERY GENEROUS VERY WHEN I GOT TO MEET HIM HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST HUMBLE PEOPLE. THAT THAT I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS MAN YET SO HUMBLE. MY FATHER WAS A BIG FAN AND HE PLAYED THE SONG CALL THE POLICE AND SAY OVER AND OVER UNTIL I BASICALLY LEARNED. AND I TOLD HIM THAT I TOLD HIM THAT MY FANS MY FATHER WAS HIS BIGGEST FAN HE- FOLLOWED HIM AROUND HIS CONCERTS. AND- THEN MY SECOND MEETING HE CALLED ME AND SAID- I YOU KNOW THERE'S A CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT PEOPLE IN MY COUNTRY. AND I FEEL THAT UNDER HIS PRESIDENCY MY PEOPLE WILL SUFFER MY COUNTRY WILL SUFFER. AND I'VE NEVER REALLY GOTTEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS POLITICS IS NOT MY THING. BUT I FEEL DEEPLY OFFENDED AND I FEEL THAT I CAN'T JUST STAND BY AND WATCH. AND I'M GOING TO COMPOSE A SONG AND I WANT YOU TO HELP ME WITH THE LYRICS BECAUSE I WANT TO GET HIM RIGHT. AND HE COMPOSED- THE SONG CALLED ALGORITHM OR IT'S AN OWN GOAL TO HILLARY CLINTON AND CARRIED ON THE HILLARY CLINTON. AND WHEN IT WAS POSTED AT FORTY MILLION VIEWS IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT WAS HIM AND APART FROM THAT HE CAME IN AND PERFORM THAT. IN IN SWING STATES IN THE COUNTRY AND TRY TO DO HIS BEST TO DEFEND HIS PEOPLE WHAT HE FELT WAS AN OFFENSE. TO HIM AND HIS COUNTRYMEN. OF FOREIGN AND ABROAD AND EVERYONE OF LATINO DESCENT AND MEXICAN DESCENT. HE FELT A CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITY AND- I WAS SO HONORED. TO BE ASKED TO EVEN CONTRIBUTE A VERY SMALL PIECE TO THAT. AND IT IS ONE MEETING HIM REALLY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND JOYS OF MY LIFE. AND TO MEET A PERSON THAT HAS INSPIRED SO MANY THAT HAS. HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE.
