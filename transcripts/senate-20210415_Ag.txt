SENATOR ALLEN YOU HAVE ONE BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE SB TWO THREE FIVE THE LECTERN IS YOURS WHAT ARE YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND MEMBERS ITS IT'S- NICE TO BE HERE I- I DON'T OFTEN COME TO THE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE WHEN I DO. WHEN I DO I LIKE TO BRING YOU COULD BILL SO THIS IS S. B. TWO THIRTY FIVE- WHICH BRINGS LEGAL CLARITY AND STRICT REGULATIONS- ON THE MANUFACTURE SALE AND USE OF HEMP DERIVED PRODUCTS. IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA SO FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW HALF IS A PLANT GROWING PROCESS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD FOR THOUSANDS OF CONSUMER GOODS INCLUDING FOOD AND TEXTILES. COSMETICS BODY CARE I'D ITEMS PAPER. IN FACT SOME OF OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS ARE ACTUALLY- DRAFTED ON HEMP PAPER- ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY KNOWN INGREDIENTS DRIVING HABITS I CANNABIS OIL. WHICH IS. CALLING ON CBD A NON PSYCHOACTIVE DERIVATIVE- WITH NO THC. NOW AS PERMITTED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. EARLY MORE THAN HALF OF ALL STATES IN THE COUNTRY PERMITTED HEMP CBD TO BE INCLUDED AS AN INGREDIENT IN FOOD BEVERAGES DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. CALIFORNIA ARE YOU PERMITS AND CAREFULLY REGULATES THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF CANNABIS. DERIVED CBD PRODUCTS REMEMBER THAT THE ONLY DISTINCTION BETWEEN CANNABIS AND HEMP IS THE LEVEL OF THC- IN THE PLANT HOWEVER THE STATE'S LAWS RELATED TO HEMP DERIVED PRODUCTS ARE MURKY SO IN RECENT YEARS THE COVER ABOUT A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE THE NUMBER OF- OF NOTICES OF VIOLATION VOLUNTARY CONDEMNATION AND DESTRUCTION LETTERS EMBARGOES RELATED TO HEMP DERIVED CBD PRODUCTS SO ARE THE CONVERSATION DEBATE SACRAMENTO ABOUT HABITS NOW ENTERING ITS THIRD YEAR I'M AUTHORED THIS PROPOSAL IN PARTNERSHIP A CELL NUMBER AGUILAR CURRY TO GIVE THE SENATE AMPLE TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE POLICY AND HOPEFULLY IMPROVE. UPON A STATUS QUO THAT DEPRIVED THE HEMP INDUSTRY INCLUDING THOSE BUSINESSES LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA FROM COMPETING ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH OVER HALF OF ALL U. S. STATES. NOW THIS LEGISLATION HEARD AND PASS OUT OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE WITH UNANIMOUS. BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS MEMBERS ARE PROPERLY SO HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON HOW THE BILL IMPACTS CALIFORNIA'S. AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. I SPOKE EXTENSIVELY WITH THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST NIGHT- AND- AND GAVE HIM A COMMITMENT. IN PERSON. THAT I WANT TO PUBLICLY MAKE TO YOU TODAY IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE CONCERNS HE RAISED. TO ME. ARE LARGELY THE CONCERNS THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU ARE SHARED BY- BYE BYE BYE FOR THE REST OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SO- LET ME JUST MENTION THAT THE KEY ISSUES. THE FIRST ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE TESTING OF HAM FOR TOTAL THC CONTENT AND- PERMITTING A MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAINTY. THAT'S A COMMON STANDARD IT'S FEDERALLY DEFINED pACHIEVED BY DIFFERENT TESTING INSTRUMENTATION. AND FACILITIES NOW I'M ABSOLUTE COMMITTED TO RESOLVING THIS ISSUE- TO THE FARM BUREAU'S SATISFACTION. AND WE'RE STARTING THOSE. ARE THE SECOND ISSUE IS A PROPOSED ZERO TOLERANCE STANDARD FOR CONTAMINANTS WHICH IS ARGUABLY. APPROPRIATE FOR THE CANNABIS PLANT. WHICH IS NOT FEDERALLY APPROVED TO BE TREATED WITH PESTICIDES THE FARM BUREAU WOULD LIKE TO THE FRONT OF THE CALIPHATE HAVE LATITUDE TO EXAMINE AN ISSUE. HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS THAT IT DECIDES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR HELP. WHICH IS FEDERALLY APPROVED TO BE TREATED WITH CERTAIN PESTICIDES THIS SEEMS REASONABLE TO ME- AND I AM AGAIN COMMITTED TO RESOLVING THE ISSUE TO THE FARM BUREAU SATISFACTION. THE FINAL ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT TO PROHIBIT HIM FROM BEING SOLD. IN A SMOKABLE ARE INHALABLE FORM- THERE IS SERIOUS DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE- I THINK WE WILL HAVE A REAL TROUBLEGETTING OUT OF HEALTH COMMITTEE QUITE FRANKLY IF WE HAD- YOU KNOW. I'VE OPENED THE FLOODGATES FOR THE FOR THAT- BUT I'M CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW POSSIBLY TO FIND COMMON GROUND. WITHIN OUR OWN SENATE FAMILY INCLUDES EVEN WITHIN THE TWO COMMITTEES- TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A DIFFERENT PROPOSAL THAN WHAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY- NOW. HI I DO ASK ON ALL THREE OF THESE CONCERNS THAT I ASK FOR YOUR INDULGENCE AT TODAY'S WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL AS IT APPEARS IN PRINCE OF THAT WE CAN SEEK RESOLUTION DURING CONVERSATIONS THE MINISTRATION WHICH OF COURSE. HAS ITS OWN FEELINGS ABOUT ALL THIS. AN ALTERNATELY I WANNA ARRIVE AT A FRAMEWORK TO THIS GOVERNOR WILL SIGN AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FEEL COMFORTABLE THEY CAN IMPLEMENT- MY STAFF AND I ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION FROM A NUMBER OF CANNABIS RETAILERS INCLUDING SOME WITHIN MY OWN DISTRICT IN. THE DISTRICTS OF SOME MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I'M ACTUALLY OPEN- TO WORKING CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH THIS COALITION SPECIFICALLY I'D LIKE CANNABIS RETAILERS TO BE ABLE TO SELL. HEMP DERIVED PRODUCTS ONE THING THEY TALK ABOUT A LOT OF PARITY- AND CERTAINLY UNDER THE CURRENT SCHEME THEY WOULD. NOT BE ABLE TO SELL. UNDER UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM SELLING NON PSYCHOACTIVE- HAVE DERIVED PRODUCTS AND- AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR SO WE HAVE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO FIND PARITY ON THAT. AT NOW ARE I WILL SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ACTIVELY ENGAGE THEY OF COURSE HAVE STRONG FEELINGS AND SO WE'VE GOT TO. ADDRESS THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEM SO AGAIN I ASK YOUR INDULGENCE TO MOVE FOR TODAY. SO JOIN ME TODAY AS WE WITNESS WE HAVE RAN MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE U. S. HEMP ROUNDTABLE AND ALSO ATTY. BERNACCHI FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEMP COUNCIL. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU CENTER ELEMENT- WILL NOT BE MOVING ON TO TESTIMONY DUE TO CONSTRAINTS. REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS. THE TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAINSTREET TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY. EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED NICKEL MOUNTAIN TIME TO BE DETERMINED BY THE CHAIR. THE LIMIT WILL BE. TWO TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. EACH WITNESS ALLOWED TO MISS TO TESTIFY. ALL THOSE WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION. AND POSITION ON THE MEASURES- CENTER ALLEN'S FIRST WITNESS.

HE WAS SHARE MEMBERS AGAIN RANDY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF U. S. HEMP ROUNDTABLE. I'M ALSO HERE REPRESENTING KHALIFA WHICH IS A CANNABIS COMPANY BASED OUT OF SAN JOSE. THERE ARE THREE OBJECTIVES THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL- AFTER AS SENATE ALLEN INDICATED. NEARLY THREE YEARS OF WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. NUMBER ONE IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS INDUSTRY LEGAL IT IS PARTIALLY LEGAL UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR TOPICALS AND CREAMS. IT IS NOT LEGAL FOR FOOD AND BEVERAGE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS OR PET PRODUCTS. AND ALL THE ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SAY THAT THOSE ARE THE PRODUCTS WHERE. WHAT THE CONSUMERS REALLY WANT TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS OVER THE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND WOULD LIKE CALIFORNIA TO BE THERE AS WELL. NUMBER TWO THERE ARE REALLY GREAT ACTORS AND HIM DENTISTRY NOW. SOME NOT SO GREAT IN TERMS OF CONSUMER SAFETY AND CONSUMER WARNINGS. THIS BILL NOW CREATES A VERY ROBUST REGULATORY FRAMEWORK- FOR CONSUMER SAFETY. IT HAS TESTING PARITY WITH CANNABIS TESTING. IT HAS LABELING PARITY WITH A CANNABIS LABELING INTER INCLUDING THINGS LIKE. A WARNING THAT- THAT PREGNANT WOMEN OR BREAST FEEDING WOMEN. SHOULD CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN. THE THIRD OBJECTIVE OF THIS BILL RIGHT NOW IS TO GENERATE SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO THE STATE. AGAIN IT'S BEEN NEARLY. THREE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. IN THAT TIME TO NINE STATES HAVE AHEAD OKAY. YOU TERMS OF LEGALIZING CBD AND ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS. THEYARE THEY ARE BENEFITING FROM THE TAX REVENUES OF THIS BRAND NEW. ARRAY OF PRODUCTS THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT- AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN WITH WITH THE TAX REVENUES WITHIN THE JOBS CREATED. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THIS IS A TIME WHEN WE CAN OBVIOUSLY USE. SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS INTO OUR STATE- ARE SPUR STATE COFFERS. WE LIKE THE SENATOR ARE ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH BOTH THE FARM BUREAU AND SOME OF THE CANVAS INTERESTS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS. WE COMPLETELY SUPPORT CANNABIS BEING ALLOWED TO. BE INCLUDED IN THE CAMP HI I'VE GOT SUPPLY CHAIN WE ALSO SUPPORT THE FARM BUREAU AND ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY REQUEST AND ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION.
