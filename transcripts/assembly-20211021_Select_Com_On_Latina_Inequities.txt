UNFORTUNATELY AS WE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS- IT'S STILL NOT MAKING THE ADVANCES WOULD LIKE TO WITH IT SO- BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR STORY BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE IT TO COURT. WE'RE HERE FROM ONE MORE ON THIS PANEL THAT WILL OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS FROM- THE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE NEXT IS KAREN BENCH COURT WE- SHE IS A OR- A MEMBER OF UNITE HERE LOCAL THIRTY. AND HER TO TELL HER STORY. HELLO HI MY NAME IS KAREN BETTENCOURT I'M TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I LIVE IN THE SOUTH BAY IN BETWEEN TWENTY ZERO AND NOT BY MISA. I WORK IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE TIME I HAVE SEEN AND BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A VARIETY OF INJUSTICES ESPECIALLY ECONOMIC INJUSTICE. NOT GETTING PAID THE SAME WAGES AS THE MAN WAS WHAT MADE ME THE ANGRIEST BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I WAS WORTH MORE THAN I WAS DOING THE SAME WORK AS A WHERE. HERE'S AGO WHEN I WAS WORKING AT MCDONALDS I WAS PROMOTED FROM BEING A CASHIER TO A FLOOR MANAGER. I WAS REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BEING RECOGNIZED AND REWARDED FOR MY HARD WORK AND DEDICATION TO MY JOB. ASSUME THAT I REALIZED THAT I WAS THAT WASN'T THE CASE. THE OTHER FERMENTATIVE INSIDE ME WAS A YOUNG MAN MAYBE A COUPLE YEARS OLDER THAN ME. WHO WAS ALSO PROMOTED FROM CASHIER TO FLOOR MANAGER A FEW MONTHS BEFORE ME. WE HAVE THE SAME RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERFORM THE SAME WORK BUT SOMEHOW HE WAS MAKING TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY AN HOUR MORE THAN I WAS. NOW IS ONLY MAKING A DOLLAR. OF A MOMENT MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT'S THE WORST. AFTER A FEW MONTHS I'VE FINALLY ASK MY MANAGER WHAT I WAS MAKING SO MUCH LESS. HE WAS. HE TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO TAKE A STEP DOWN IN ORDER TO MOVE UP. THAT ANSWER REALLY UPSET ME AND COMBINED WITH THE WORKLOAD AND WITH THE OTHER MANAGER ALWAYS TEASING ME THAT HE WAS MAKING MORE MONEY THAN ME. FINALLY LET ME TO QUIT. IT JUST WASN'T WORTH IT AFTER A QUICK MADONNA WENT TO WORK AS A ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT AT OUR WATER WORK THE WORKERS REPRESENTED BY UNITE HERE LOCAL THIRTY DELIVERY UNION THAT REPRESENTS- HOSPITALITY WORKERS. THOSE WORKERS HAVE A UNION CONTRACT WITH WAGES THAT WERE FAIR FOR EVERYBODY. ALSO MY BEST FRIEND WHO IS A LATINA HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE A FEW YEARS AGO. MANAGEMENT TO ASK WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY SAY THEY WILL LOOK INTO IT. NOTHING EVER CAME SO SHE LEFT IN DECIDED JUST TO FOCUS ON HER MASTER'S DEGREE. TODAY'S SHE'S INTERESTS SOCIAL WORKER REPRESENTED BY THE UNION. WHO WORKS FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. AS FOR ME I NOW WORK ON THE OTHER AN ORGANIZER FOR UNITE HERE. WHERE BUILT UP ENOUGH LIKE MYSELF TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WORKPLACES. WITH GOOD BAIT MAKING THE SAME MONEY AND HAVING THE SAME BENEFITS OTHER MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I MEAN OPEN IT UP NOW TO OUR PANEL LEGISLATORS IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- FROM THAT FIRST PANEL ON JUST THE OVERALL PAY GAP. BUT SINCE EILEEN IS STILL ON THE- ON ON THE SCREEN I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT YOU SHARED YOUR GREAT GRANDMOTHER STORY. AND IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU ARE GET OUT JUST LIKE SHE WAS AND I SALUTE YOU FOR THAT THAT'S SO IMPORTANT I LOVE THAT AND I LOVE THAT WE HAVE HERE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ MENTIONED WE HAVE OUR OWN MATH MATH MATHEMATICIAN BUT WE ALL GOT GO TO WHEN WE HAVE THESE ISSUES WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STEM SAME AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOOSE A THREE OF US. WHO IS OUR OTHERS THEM BABY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THAT STORY AND IF I MAY CAMERON. WHO JUST SPOKE. KAREN WOULD WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU THE FACT YOU LEFT THE JOB DO YOU KNOW IF ANY OF THE- OTHER LATINOS WHO COME AFTER YOU HAVE THINGS CHANGED OR IS IT STILL THE SAME AT MCDONALD'S. COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE BECAUSE IF NOT IT'S AND FORTUNATELY WERE VIRTUAL ALSO. I BELIEVE EVERYTHING SAY THE SAME I LOST CONTACT WITH A LOT OF ROOM SO. AS FAR AS I KNOW. THE CHANGE. AT NIGHT I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO BE YOUR ANSWER AND I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT BUT I WANTED IT SAID SO THAT NOT JUST MCDONALD'S BUT ALL OF THE OTHER EMPLOYERS RECOGNIZE THAT. PEOPLE ARE WATCHING PEOPLE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND WE DO WANT TO SEE A CHANGE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MANAGER KAREN AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE IF I'M SORRY TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT I SHOULD. PROBABLY WARN SHOULD ASK THIS QUESTION BUT SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LEADING A PAY GAP THERE ARE THE TRADITIONAL- THOUGHTS IF YOU'RE IN THE SAME JOB AND YOU MAKE IT DIFFERENT AMOUNT LIKE YOU WERE YOU WERE DESCRIBING. ALSO WHAT I LEAN WITH DESCRIBING- HAVING THE SAME RESPONSIBILITIES THE SAME BACKGROUND AND YET YOU'RE MAKING LESS THAN YOUR WHITE MALE COUNTERPART. BUT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT I HOPEFULLY I'M NOT CATCHING UP GARDEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS OKAY TOO BUT- WE HAVE. WE HAVE THAT'S THE TRADITIONAL PAY GAP YOU'RE IN THE SAME JOB IN NOT MAKING THE SAME EASY TO PROVE IN COURT BUT WE HAVE A COMPOUNDED PROBLEM WITH- JOBS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY WOMEN HELP LET ME KNOW HEALTH. AND I WOULD THINK IN FACT IN HOTELS FROM AT LEAST PAST EXPERIENCES- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOR EXAMPLE A HOTEL HOUSEKEEPER IN A BILL MA'AM RIGHT WELL BILL PERSON BUT SO OFTEN MEN HOTEL HOUSEKEEPERS TEND TO BE LEVINE AS- OVERWHELMINGLY ARE WOMEN WHO ARE- IMMIGRANTS AND THEN. A LOT OF THE- BILL BOYS. ARE WHITE MEN. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT HAPPENS WITH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE GETTING TIPS OR THEIR CONTRACT IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN HOW WE VALUE THESE JOBS ONE ONE BEING DONE BY A LEVINE AND ONE GET BE DONE. ONE BY ONE MA'AM. PREDOMINANT I KNOW. A MY GET UP FROM. WHO FELLOW AND THAT'S GREAT BUT- I PERSONALLY I NEVER A LATINA. OR O. WOMAN THAT IT'S A BILL PERCENT. AT ALWAYS AND IT'S RIGHT AWAY BUT THE TIPS ARE MAKES THEM. YOU KNOW EARNED FOR- I GUESS OR I'M ASSUMING THAT BECAUSE- AS A HOUSEKEEPER THIS IS JUST REVISION OF THE WOMEN BUILD UP JOB. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR IT'S THEY THEY MADE- WITH THE UNION CONTRACT TO MAKE- GOOD MONEY BUT I BELIEVE THAT. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH AND YOU KNOW AT THE MOMENT THEY MAKE MINIMUM WAGE BUT THE TIPS ARE WHAT MAKE THEM MAKE MORE- THAT. THANK YOU IT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS SO OFTEN- ESPECIALLY A JOBS HELD BY LATINOS A IN THIS IS WHY WE START THE ON SCENE MEDINA AND IS TO- GO UNSEEN RIGHT A LOT OF TIMES IF YOU STAY AT A HOTEL WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE OUR HOTEL HOUSEKEEPER. AND WE FORGET THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE THEM TO WHERE WE SEE THE BELLBOY WE FEEL GUILTY AND SO YOU KNOW WE IMMEDIATELY TOOK THEM- AND SO IT'S AS SOMETIMES JUST THE LINE OF WORK IN WHO HAS TRADITIONALLY HELD IT AND HOW WE TREAT THEM SO. THANK YOU THOUGH THANK YOU FOR TELLING YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THE WIDE VARIETY OF FIELDS. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS IF NOT WE'LL MOVE TO OUR SECOND PANEL OF. MISTER JONES SAWYER PLEASE. DID THAT WORK ALL RIGHT- I'M FROM LOS ANGELES- REPRESENTS SOUTH LOS ANGELES AND PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT I WORK FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN AN APARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES. AND FOR DECADES- ESPECIALLY IN THE CUSTODIAL GROUP WEARS MOSTLY LATINOS. THE ONES THAT WORKED IN THE EVENING NOT ONLY WERE THEIR THEIR WAGES KIND OF SUPPRESSED. I RECALL THERE WAS THIS KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL. STRUGGLE THAT WAS GOING ON WE FOUND OUT THERE WERE MALE SUPERVISORS THAT IF A WOMAN SPOKE UP ABOUT THEIR WORK HOURS INJUSTICES BEING FORCED TO DO THINGS. SOMETIMES SEXUAL- IT IT CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE NO ONE SPOKE UP. AND THAT ALSO COULD CREATE A CHASM IN IN THE WORKPLACE AND THERE WERE MALES- AND WERE MALE ALLIES THAT WHEN IT TO HELP. BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO- THANK GOD FOR. THE ME TOO MOVEMENT BECAUSE NOW WE'RE WE'RE BEING TAUGHT YOUR MAIL ALLY. THIS PRESS THE MEMBERS ARE ON THIS COMMITTEE ARE BEING TAUGHT ON HOW WE CAN HELP. ELIMINATE THAT DEBT HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND THIS MAY BE POOR MAYBE FOR SARAH CRAWFORD THE LAWYER. BUT HOW CAN WE BE MALE ALLIES HELP. IN THIS EFFORT BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO ME. AND- BACK IN THE DAY THEY CAME TO ME AND SAID THEY WERE BEING OPPRESSED OR DEPARTMENT WAS OF A SEXUAL NATURE. I DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I DO NOW I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO NOW. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO GET OUR MALE ALLIES- INVOLVE IN THIS FOR LATINOS IN THE WAY THAT PROBABLY HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE IF ALL BOATS RISE DO WE ALL RIGHT YOU JUST CAN'T LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND. THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ARE YOU STILL ON THE PHONE IF YOU CAN ADDRESS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TACTICS THAT MEN MALE ALLIES CAN USE TO HELP WITH KIND OF THESE GENDER DISPARITIES. SHE'S ON THE LINE I AM HERE. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME- YES WE CAMP. HE DID AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND EXACTLY THE KIND OF QUESTION THAT WE LOVE HEAR YOU KNOW HOW CAN MEN BE BETTER ANALYZE. AND THERE IS A BIG MAN OKAY NAY YOU BUY. READINGS AND THEN- WHO ARE. BEING ACTIVE- HE ACTIVE PEOPLE THAT ARE BUYING HERE HAVE TO MEDIA. IRAQ ANYTHING THEN IT. TO SPEAK OUT I WILL THEY SEE THEM GOING ON THAT IS NOT RIGHT EVEN THAT MY ISSUE AN IDENTITY. WORKING IN A COUNTRY ASSEMBLY TRAIN AND- MAN TO EVER ACTING- WHETHER MANAGERS OR COLLEAGUES OR THIRD PARTIES WHETHER CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS- IT YEAH EVEN IF I DID ANYTHING MOVEMENT WE ARE STILL BEING AND RECORD NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS THAT RACK MEN'S. IN AND THEN CALIFORNIA HAD MADE GOOD PROGRESS YOU- DO CAN PASS LAWS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR WOMEN TO COME FORWARD WITH COMPLAINTS OF HARASSMENT- TO GET RELIEF WHEN THEY FACE HARASSMENT- IT CERTAINLY THERE IS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE AND I THINK A GREAT FIRST STEP WILL BE INVOLVING MEN WERE ACTIVELY AND BEING OUTLINED. ITS PLAN RECOMMENDED- THANK YOU. QUITE FRANKLY WE ARE THE PROBLEM MAN NO MATTER WHAT COLOR NOT JUST WHITE MEN SO WE NEED TO BE ACTIVE IN THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP YOU KNOW- ARE COMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR AND- WE HIGH LIKE THIS EVERY TIME WE HAVE TRIED SPECIFICALLY TO ENSURE. THAT THE DISCUSSION IS CENTERED AROUND THE **** SO FOR MOST OF OUR IMPACT ALL OF OUR HEARINGS- THE PRIMARY OF FOLKS WHO SPEAK ARE LATINOS IF WE CAN'T FIND A LEVINE IN THE FIELD OR ARE THERE OTHER- FOLKS WHO ARE EXPERTS WE EXTEND THAT TO WOMEN FIRST- AND WE HAVE YET TO HAVE A MALE. EVEN TESTIFY AT ONE OF OUR COMMITTEES- LET- LET ME KNOW. IF WE REALLY HAVE TRIED TO DO IT INTENTIONALLY. BUT PERHAPS FOR A FUTURE HEARING WE SHOULD HAVE A PANEL MINNETONKA ABOUT HOW- AND NON LATINO WOMEN IN TALK ABOUT ALLEGATIONS AND WHAT CAN BE DONE- I THINK YOU'RE BRINGING UP A GOOD POINT WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO CONSTANTLY- RELY ON OURSELVES AND I THINK THAT. THERE'S A REASON WORK WE'RE DOING THAT HIGHLIGHTING BECAUSE THERE ARE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD THAT ARE LIKE YOU KNOW WE WANT A HIGH LIKE THAT BUT- THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT AND I THINK WE'LL WE'LL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION FOR MAYBE OUR NEXT HEARING IS. IS THINK ABOUT HOW- THE STRATEGIES ARE BEING USED BY NON LATINOS TO HELP. PULL UP LATINAS WHO ARE TRADITIONALLY INCIDENT WORKS THANK YOU READY FOR THAT. MISTER JONES SAWYER. M.

INTO THIS CONVERSATION I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO EXAMINE AT ALL LEVELS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC SECTOR I KNOW AS- I BELIEVE I AM THE FIRST LATINA LABOR COMMISSIONER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M ALSO THE FIRST- COMPLETELY SATISH FLUENT SPANISH SPEAKER OF SO I ALSO APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S ARREST SORRY THIS IS RACIST COMMENTS ABOUT US SPEAKING IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND LOOKING STUDENTS OUR COMMUNITIES. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE IS THE CHIEF WAGE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER WE ALL KNOW THAT SADLY THESE PROTECTIONS ALTHOUGH INCREDIBLY FALL HARD FOUGHT BY COMMUNITY LEADERS SOME OF THEM ON THIS PANEL YU WILL HEAR FROM TODAY AND FROM YOU FEARS LEADERS BEFORE US- WHO HAVE BEEN VERY BOLD IN LEADERSHIP IN RESPONDING TO THE HARMS WE KNOW HAPPENING IN THESE WORKPLACES NONETHELESS THESE LAWS LIMITING THE BILL AND I AGREE TOWER. IS WORKERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS THEN THEY ARE NOT GOING TO EXERCISE. THEM AND THE HE OKAY PROTECT ACT OF BILLS RIGHT PROVIDE UNDER THE P. ARE NOT JUST. WITH TO OUR AT AVAILABLE. AT MINIMAL WAGE AND ALL. AND MEAL AND REST AND THE OTHER IS AS THE OF MADAM CHAIR HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED AND- I HAVE FOUND IN MY TWO YEARS OF SERVICE INTERNALLY THAT WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH AND ONE OF MY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO BREAK DOWN THESE WALLS AND BARRIERS GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO COME OUT. OF THESE BUILDINGS AND WE NEED TO MEET TO THE COMMUNITY WHERE ARE WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE INSTITUTIONAL I'M SORRY INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA THAT WE HEARD EILEEN SPEAKING ABOUT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE TRAUMAS THAT WE HEARD THE SISTER- WOULD WORK AT MCDONALD'S. ABOUT TO MANY OF THE WORKERS IN THE STATE HAVE NO FAITH IN OUR OPERATION OF THESE BASIC PROTECTIONS IN US AS GOVERNMENT IS THERE ARE EMPLOYMENT. SO WE NEED TO BUILD A PATHWAY TO HEALING AB ONE OF THE THINGS I AM DOING IS I IMPLEMENTED A TRAUMA INFORMED INITIATIVE WE NEED TO BECOME TRAUMA INFORMED WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE TRANSACTIONAL WITH THESE MATTERS OF LAW AND ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE WE ARE FURTHER HARMONY OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE SINGLE MOMS ARE LGBT ARTS YOU ARE WORKERS WITH FUNCTIONAL AND ACCESS NEEDS ANALYSTS ALSO ON AND ON AND ON. SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AS THE PANEL HAS OR A SORRY AS THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S ALREADY RECOGNIZED WE DO NOT ALL START FROM THE SAME PLACE AND WE ALL KERRY VARIOUS. EXPERIENCES IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN WERE THAT WE BRING. ALAMEDA A COUNTRY THAT HAS A HISTORY US. AND LABOUR. WHEN CANNOT ACT AS IF WE HAVE THE SAME STAR POINT. SO WHAT. SHARE DAY. BACK IN- DISCERNING- BUT ANOTHER LESS. WE WERE WE WERE ASKED TO SHARE OF THOSE. SO IN THE LAST THREE. WE HAVE RECEIVED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY EPA CLAIMS- AND ETA HAS NOTED WAS RECENTLY EXTENDED BY GOVERNOR BROWN'S. TO INCLUDE RACE AND ETHNICITY. AND SO FIFTY SIX OF THE SLAIN HAVE BEEN ACCESS FOR INVESTIGATING SO THAT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY OF THEM. OF THOSE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY CLAIMS WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE OF THEM THAT ARE ACTIVE. TWO HUNDRED AND SIX OF THEM HAVE BEEN CLOSED 67% OF THEM HAVE BEEN CLOSED BECAUSE WORKERS HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR CLEAN OR ABANDON THEIR CLAIMS I ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CLASSIFICATION WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN A WORKING ABANDONS OR A WORKER- AT. WITH LAWCENTER CLEAN AND A LOT OF IT IS FORMAL WITHDRAWAL BUT IF YOU HAVE ADDED IS WHEN WORKERS SPONSORED AND OUR AGENCY DOES WORK A LOT WE DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF CALLS AND TRYING TO GET EMAILS AVAILABLE IF FOLKS ARE REPRESENTATIVES SOMETIMES AND WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING A HOLD OF THEM. HELLO I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THESE NUMBERS GET A WHAT I JUST SAID KNOWLEDGE IN MY OPENING COMMENTS AND WE KNOW FROM THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD THAT THESE TWO WOMEN TODAY ARE REPRESENTATIVE UNFORTUNATELY A HUNDRED AND THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF WORKERS SO THIS CLEARLY RE ITERATES THE NEED FOR US TO WARRANT THAT ESTABLISH AN ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE ENGAGE WITH OUR COMMUNITY A PROGRAM I LOST IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY IS A WORKPLACE RIGHTS AMBASSADORS PROJECT THIS IS A TRAUMA INFORMED STRATEGY INITIATIVE WHERE WE ARE REACHING OUT WAY FROM UNITY PARTNERS LIKE THE EAST VALLEY WOMAN CENTER. LIKE THE BLACK WORKER CENTER LAGGY THIS GONNA SEEN US WHO ARE TRUSTED COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO SO MANY TRAUMATIZED WORKERS WILL NOT COME FROM GOVERNMENTS BUT THEY WILL GO TO THESE COMMUNITY LEADERS AND WE ARE LOOKING TO BUILD A. LONG LAST YEAR INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LABOR COME. OFFICE AND THESE KIND OF PARTNERS SO THAT WHEN. THEY ARE YOU V. VICTOR AS THEY ARE HELD MY- AND FATHERS. THROUGH IT SYSTEM OR NOT CARE SYSTEM. AND THEY HEAR ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE- IT DOESN'T GET PUSHED ASIDE BUT THAT ACTUALLY IS THE FLAG FOR THEM AND SAY HI I KNOW WHERE I COULD GO GET HELP WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL AND FOR HIS AMILY. SO WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE ANOTHER INITIATIVE WE HAVE IS EACH AND EVERY CALIFORNIAN CAMPAIGN THIS IS AN OUTREACH CAMPAIGN THAT WE ALSO LAUNCHED LAST YEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND OUR PRIORITY TO CONTACT IN THIS CAMPAIGN ARSANIS VIPERS WE HAVE OPENED- COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE TV NETWORKS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OPEN COMMUNICATION WITH HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS AGAIN FOR THIS REALITY THAT YOU CANNOT COMPARTMENTALIZE THIS ISSUE I THINK WE HAVE ALL SEEN. IN THE PAST JANET HOW THE REALITIES OF THE WORKPLACE ARE MATTERS OF SOCIAL L. B. AND AFFECT EVERYBODY SO I LOOK VERY MUCH FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH I BELIEVE A WITNESS DAY WAS CAMERON- BECAUSE WHAT SHE REPORTED BE DONALD- IS DISTURBING AS WITH ANY EMPLOYER WHO ENGAGE IN SUCH PRACTICES AND I KNOW IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY I'VE HEARD FROM WOMEN I KNOW. AGDISTIS HOWEVER FOR WOMEN SO MOST OF IT ET CLEAN THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED THEY ARE JUST. ACROSS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. AND THE CONCENTRATION GEOGRAPHICALLY.

ALL IT IS TOO HARD DIFFERENT INDUSTRY ROBERT. IN THE- THREE HUNDRED SIXTY WE RECEIVE. MOST OF THE THAT ARE IN AFTER INVESTIGATION OUR HIGH YOUR AND IMPLEMENTS IT IS IN THE MEDICAL FOR. IT IS IN A LEGAL. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT REPRESENTATION FROM THE SECURITY OFFICER- FIELD AND SO MY POINTS OF REFERENCE IN THE WITNESSES TESTIMONY IS THERE ARE TOO MANY WOMEN EMPLOYED IN LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES- WHO THIS IS FAR BEYOND.

I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO TERRORIZE. WITH US YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO LIVE LATINO VOICES TOGETHER AND MAKE SURE THAT QUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY HAS COME FIRST AND LAST. THANK YOU HOLLY- WE'LL MOVE ON NOW TO JESSICA STENDER- SHE'S AN ATTORNEY WITH EQUAL RIGHTS HAVE A KIDS WORKS WITH US CLOSELY ON LEGISLATION THE CAPITAL. SHE'S ALSO VIRTUALLY.

TODAY I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE WE DISCRIMINATION AND WORKING TO CLOSE THE WEEK AT WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE STAGGERING% NUMBERS THAT LEADING UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ONE OF THE WORST WE'VE GOTTEN BACK HERE IN OUR STATE A. ARE THE THESIS ANGELA IN SECURITY PRIOR TO THE GOLDEN NINETEEN HEADACHE AND IT WAS FURTHER EXACERBATED WE ALL KNOW BY DEMANDING RESULTING IN A CRISIS. SO NO THAT'S LONG HAUL HE RESPONDS OTHER CRITICAL TO ADDRESSES WHERE YOU GOT THE FINAL OUT UNITS AND BREAK THE CITADEL WEALTH DISPARITIES THAT CONTINUE TO HOLD AND THEIR FAMILIES BACK WE TALKED SOME ABOUT IMPORTANT SEPTIC CALIFORNIA SEEKING TO ADDRESS THE WAGE GAP- MANY ARE LAWS OF CERTAIN THE BLUEPRINT FOR OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW AND WHILE THE BURDEN TRACTION HAVE LED TO SOME REMAIN AS WE DISCUSS ANY PERSISTENCE ANNA HARM OF THE WEEK AFTER LOOKING AT REALLY GETTING AND- CONTINUED AND MORE RIGOROUS POLICY CHANGE TO DO BETTER ADDRESSING CONTRIBUTORS. TO THAT WE'VE GOT THAT FOR HARMLESS DINA THEIR FAMILIES SO OVER A FEW OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORT IN CALIFORNIA WHICH I WOULD RATHER GET INTO SOME OTHER STATES AND HOW ABOUT SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT MADE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IF THERE ARE. NO THAT ONE IS YEARS AWAY JACQUI THAT HE DETERMINATION RETALIATED FOR A SITE WORKERS OFTEN ARE AWARE OF THEIR P. GENERATED CAME DISPARITIES AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OFTEN REFERRED TOAS P. SECRECY POLICIES WHERE EMPLOYERS DISCOURAGE OVERHEAD AND POLICE TO TALK ABOUT A HOUSING PROBLEM AND NOT AND HE'S WORKERS REALLY REALIZING THAT THEY HAD CERVANTES IN FACT NATIONALLY ABOUT 60% OF WORKERS THE PRIVATE SECTOR EITHER FORBIDDEN. OR STRONGLY DISCOURAGE. THE VERY SUBSTANTIAL HE'S VERY THAT SHE EXPERIENCED WITH HER MALE HOW ORDER ROUTING EXACTING JOB EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES CANADA COLOMBIA AFTER THE REVISIONS OF THE STOCK IN A TYPE OF PEABODY POLICY MY EMPLOYERS AND WE ENCOURAGE. FROM OTHER CITIES ANOTHER AREA THAT OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT EIGHT INDIVIDUAL PRIOR SALARY IN ANY CASE THAT THE EMPLOYER IS HEADED ARGUED THAT IT WAS LAWFUL TO PAY HER LESS THAN HER MALE COLLEAGUES FOR THE EXACT SAME JOB SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU EARNED LESS IN A PRIOR JOB. THE NINTH CIRCUIT CLEARLY REJECTED THAT ARGUMENT AND HELD THAT PRIOR SALARY CANNOT BE DEFENSE UNDER THE FEDERAL EQUAL PAY ACT UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS OBVIOUSLY ON THIS ISSUE HOWEVER CALIFORNIA OUR EQUAL PAY ADDED EXPLICITLY SAYS THAT PRIOR SALARY COULD NOT BE USED TO JUSTIFY ANY FOUR HUNDRED AND OR OR EASY WAYS TO THIS AREA OF THE LAW ON ANY ALSO KNOW THAT IT HIRING IS ALREADY IN THE FUTURE AND WEARS OFF ASK. ME WHICH THEN CAUSES THE PERPETUATION OF THESE GENERATION WASTE AFTER OF COURSE MOST PARTICULARLY HARD LIKE HE S. SO CALIFORNIA WE ALSO WANT TO GET IN A PLAYER FROM ASKING ABOUT PRIOR SALARY ENSURING THAT THEY ONLY USE THEY'RE- THAT LAFONTAINE BONAFIDE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHAT WITH VERSION SHOULD BE PAID. THE IMPORTANT REASON IS THAT ALREADY BEEN DONE ON OUR PRAYERS OUR DEAL IN CALIFORNIA HOLES IN SOME OTHER STATES HAVE ACTUALLY SHOWN THAT HE PRIOR SALARY BANDS HAVE HAD THEIR INTENDED EFFECT AND HAVE RESULTED IN THEIR OWN THE OVERALL. MASON BECAUSE OF THE FOLDERS AND- ANIMATOR AND THE CITY SO THEY DECIDED TO PROVIDE A PROTECTION IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS THE INTERNATIONAL DISCRIMINATION NOT LOOKING. AT OTHER WOMEN OF COLOR FACE. THE TALKED ON IS HE UP LET SUMMER. LAST YEAR LEGISLATURE HAS AT THE I. SEVENTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS WITH ONE HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES DOES IT APPEAR OR IN A LEAD TO THE DEPARTMENT APPARENTLY A HOUSING WHICH OUTLINED THAT HE THAT HE GAVE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. BROKEN DOWN BY GENDER RACE ETHNICITY JOHN HENRY. THIS LAW IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE WAR BACKS ON HE HAD A COLLECTION OF THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HALTED AN OBAMA ERA- PETER PETER CORNISH'S. AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARDS ENSURING THAT WE HAVE MORE FRIENDS HERE AND GET OUT OF PIZZA SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS IT. IMPORTANTLY IT RESIDENTS WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT TODAY- OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION NO THAT HE CONSIDERED TO BE ALWAYS GAP SO WE KNOW THAT NOT ONLY ARE MALE DOMINATED OCCUPATIONS. OFTEN AT A HIGHER PACE THEN EMAIL IT AND WE DON'T LIKE HE HAS THAT ON HERE MANY OF THE LOWER PAID OCCUPATIONS BUT EVEN WITH EIGHT INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WE OFTEN SEE PATTERNS HOCKEY. SEASON WHEREBY WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR TINA'S ARE OFTEN A FOCUS GAINING CONCENTRATED IN THE LOWER CAGES. SO THIS BILL WILL INITIALLY WERE SHOOTINGS THAT IS THE LAW ONE THAT EMPLOYERS UPON CONDUCTING PAY ARTISTS REQUIRED IMMEDIATE WHO ARE AGENCIES WILL. POTENTIALLY HOWEVER DISPARITIES AND OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION THE WORK WHERE. IT'LL PROMPT THEM TO ANALYSIS AND RECTIFIED HE ABSOLUTELY AWFUL BUT ALSO REALLY IMPORTANTLY ASK THEM TO SAY HEY WE SEE THAT ALL WHITE MEN HIS MEDIATION ALMOST ALL PEOPLE OF COLOR AND I SEEN AS AN ORDERLY WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO OUR RECRUITMENT. ARE HIRING OR RETENTION AND OUR PROMOTION PRACTICES TO ENSURE THAT OUR LIMITATION OF LATINOS AND OTHER WORKERS OF COLOR AND WOMEN. AT ALL AGE LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY. DISCLOSURE NOT INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE NECESSARILY BUT DISCLOSURE BY COMPANIES- GAS AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THAT WHEN THEY DO HAVE TO DISCLOSE THEY MORE OFTEN ALSO DISCLOSED THAT EIGHTY EIGHT STEPS INCIDENT ACTION PLANS TO ADDRESS THAT IT IS VERY. SO WE KNOW THE PUBLIC FOLDERS. IN FACTORED IN DOLLARS INTRODUCED AB FOLLOW NINE ONE SEVENTEEN WHICH WOULD REQUIRE LARGE COMPANIES TO REPORT BROADBEACH ENERGIES HE ASKED AND IT HAD THAT HE HAD A PUBLISHED ONLINE. DESPITE HAVING THE LEGISLATURE WITH VETOED AND INFORMATIVE STEP WOULD BE TO ENSURE SOME TYPE OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF MEDIA. THE LAST. ONE WE HAD ON HERE. WE KNOW WOMEN ARE MORE ON THAN THE PEOPLE IN FAMILY WHO WERE CARE TO CHILL OR OTHER MEMBERS YOU NEED- WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE- DETERMINE AND SOME FROM LAWYER. WHO MADE IT TO THE OTHER TO DO THEIR JOB HELLO COMMITTEE ON NOT YOU THEY ARE SO CRITICAL THAT WE NEED pTHE FAMILY WAS ON. FOR MANY OF THE ONE SET SHOWED THAT THAN HALF OF THE LAST IN NEARLY HALF OF THE BLACK WOMEN REPORT IF YOU'RE GETTING. TO CALL OUT OF THE HEY MOREOVER WE DIDN'T UNDER JOB INSIGNIFICANT LIKE TO SAY THAT THEY WERE LIKELY TO HE WORK BECAUSE. PLEASE ASK YOUR HIGHER HEATING PROFESSIONALS SO. IS THERE ANYTHING AGAINST YOUR YOUR IT IF YOU EVER. AND HE TO THREE COMMENTING GOT TUESDAY. THE HARSHEST WILL ON A AS- A LEAST ONE. NINETY BY C. ANIMALS SIX ARGUE ACTED TYPE OF CARE TO I'M JUST. PROTECTION AS WE HOLD HEALTH WILL MOVE BALL IN ARE WELL THERE IS A PENDING BILL AS HE ONE ONE. EIGHTY ONE ONE ONE. WE CAN DO THAT I. FINALLY I JUST AND I KNOW. THIS IS TO COME BEFORE THEM HARD. TO WE HAVE TO STAY NOW BECAUSE W HAVE TO OUR SPEAKERS AND WE'RE- FAR OVER. HELLO CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS VANESSA HERNANDEZ BAGNOLI. AND I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY TO REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION THAT REALLY HAS CENTERED THE VOICES AND EXPERIENCES OF LATINAS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. HOPE HISPANOS ORGANIZE FOR POLITICAL EQUALITY IS PROUD TO CONCENTRATE RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE. TO ENSURING THAT LATINO SPECIFIC DATA EXISTS. I'M NOT ONLY EXISTS BUT IS UTILIZED AT POLICY MAKING TABLES AND INFORMS POLICIES THAT IMPACT OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. OUR ECONOMIC STATUS OF LATINAS REPORT HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS WORK MANY OF THE DATA THAT IS HAS BEEN CITED TODAY IS IN LINE WITH WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN OUR ESL OUR REPORT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AS WE HEARD EARLIER IN CALIFORNIA LATINAS MAKE FORTY TWO CENTS TO THE DOLLAR OF A WHITE MALE COUNTERPART. AND IN ADDITION TO THIS DATA. BY TWENTY TWENTY OUR REPORT HIGHLIGHTS SOME OTHER NUANCES THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT BEFORE MOVING TO SOLUTIONS. WHY AND I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE AGAIN THAT CALIFORNIA'S PAY GAP FOR LATINAS IS THE LARGEST IN THE NATION. SECONDLY I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE. THAT ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE PAY GAP VARIES IN PLACES LIKE SAN JOSE IT IS THE LARGEST AT POINT THIRTY THREE CENTS PER DOLLAR AND IN PLACES SUCH AS FRESNO IT'S CLOSER TO FIFTY CENTS PER DOLLAR THIS IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS WE LOOK AT SOLUTIONS. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE AGAIN THE HOPES REPORT FINDS THAT THE PAY GAP PERSISTS NO MATTER THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION. THIS IS A FACT THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE OR LOOK AWAY FROM. ALL OF THESE NUANCES ARE IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE TO ELEVATE THIS CONVERSATION AND FURTHERMORE AS WE IDENTIFY A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS FRONT. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE WAGE GAP IS DISCRIMINATION AS WE'VE HEARD FROM PERSONAL NARRATIVE IN THE DATA TODAY ROOTING OUT DISCRIMINATION IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS CONVERSATION. NEXT I'D LIKE TO OFFER A FEW SOLUTIONS TO START TACKLING THIS ISSUE IN ADDITION TO ALL THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE. EARLIER THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS HAS MENTIONED THE PLEDGE THAT COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS CAN TAKE ONLINE THIS INCENTIVE IS IMPORTANT THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO MAKE IT MANDATORY AND TRANSPARENT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT TO A PROMISING PRACTICE IN MASSACHUSETTS A REALLY DIVERSE COALITION CALLED THE WAGE EQUITY NOW IS TACKLING THIS ISSUE HEAD ON. THEY'RE CURRENTLY RUNNING LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS TRANSPARENCY IN WAGES STATEWIDE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN CALIFORNIA AS MENTIONED BY JESSICA THIS DATA ALREADY EXIST IT IS ALREADY COLLECTED IT IS JUST NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC. EQUAL PAY IS CRITICAL FOR LATINOS AND THE STATE AND THE FULL ECONOMY HOPE ENVISIONS A FUTURE WHERE LATINOS ARE PAID EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK WHEN LATINOS ARE SEEN AS LEADERS CONTRIBUTORS AND CATALYSTS THAT THEY TRULY ARE. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY SPACES LIKE THIS TO UP LIFT THIS CONVERSATION AND THE SOLUTION AND WE ARE ALSO ENCOURAGED TO ADDRESS SO MANY STRONG LATINOS WHOSE REPRESENTATION TODAY. IS ALSO A KEY STRATEGY FOR THIS CONVERSATION. FINALLY I WANT TO THANK CHAIRWOMAN GONZALEZ SUPERVISOR VARGAS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALL OF THEIR ADVOCACY AND COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BRING HIM BACK MY- SHAME ON YOU BILL I THINK THAT GOT VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN- ALL RIGHT LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST. WE HAVE SEEN IT IS FROM THE UCLA LATINO POLICY AND POLITICS INITIATIVE- AND I JUST HAVE TO GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT- WHEN WE START UNSEEN LEVINE AS AT WITH IT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU ASK PEOPLE FOR HELP YOU ASK FOR A LITTLE HELP BUT- WE HAVE RELIED SO HEAVILY ON THE RESEARCH DONE. AND THE PRESENTATION STAND BY SONIA AND HER COLLEAGUES- THAT WERE HOPING IN THIS NEXT YEAR WE FIND A PERMANENT HOME FOR THE UNSEEN LEVINE AS INITIATIVE AT UCLA THROUGH OUR BUDGET. PRIORITIES JUST GIVE A LITTLE SHOUT OUT TO THAT EARLY- BE IN. A WE HAVE SOME MONEY NEXT YEAR- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. IT KEEPS GOING THAT THIS GOES BEYOND THESE MEMBERS AND SO IT YOU KNOW I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN ORGANIZATION RESEARCH ORGANIZATION STEP UP AND PROVIDE US WITH SO MANY RESOURCES AND BE SUCH A CRITICAL ASPECT ABOUT THE THANK YOU SONYA AND PLEASE. TAKE US HOME THAT'S A REALLY SWEET AND EXCITING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MY FACULTY COLLEAGUES HAVE PARTICIPATED IN EVERY HEARING- THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND I THINK THAT'S TREMENDOUS. BECAUSE WE NEED MORE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LATINAS. THERE EITHER A MONOLITH- OR THEY ARE INVISIBLE AND SO THIS UNSEEN MARTINEZ INITIATIVE HAS GIVEN LIGHT TO THE DIFFERENT CONTOURS FROM THE LAW TO MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. TO WORKERS AND THE STRONG ROLE THAT LETTING US PLAY AND LATINO HOUSEHOLDS IN SHAPING AMERICA- I'M GONNA PROVIDE SOME QUICK DATA POINTS FOR YOU AND I'M ALSO GONNA SPEAK TO. WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I THINK BOTH OF REGINALD JONES SAWYER AND THEN ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ELOISE GOMEZ REYES ASKED WHICH IS WHAT WE CAN DO AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE. WE SHOULD BE HEADED. SO THESE ARE MY CONTRIBUTORS THAT PERSON IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE UNDER HERNANDEZ IS THE ONE WHO AUTHORED. THE EXITING THE WORKFORCE REPORT ON MEDINA SHE IS NOW AN INCOMING PHD STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY AND THE ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT- WE'RE GOING TO QUICKLY TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF LATINAS IN THE U. S. WORKFORCE. WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS WHY THEY DROPPED OUT OF THE WORKFORCE SOMEWHERE THIS IS REALLY SOUNDING THE ALARM BELLS FOR ALL POLICYMAKERS. WIDER ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS MATTER AND THEN ULTIMATELY TO THE LAST POINT WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN DO IS STAKEHOLDERS AND AS LEGISLATORS- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE DATA COBA NINETEEN ESSENTIALLY DECIMATED BLACK AND BROWN. COMMUNITIES THAT WAS NOT THE GREAT EQUALIZER. AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT IT WAS VERY HARMFUL FOR LATINAS WHAT THIS SHOWS IS THAT AFTER THE PANDEMIC IN DO SHUTDOWNS RIGHT THE CLOSURES TO BUSINESS. LEISURE HOSPITALITY LATINAS EXPERIENCE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THIS WAS TWENTY POINT TWO PERCENT. MORE THAN ANY OTHER RACIAL ETHNIC GROUP GENDER X. CETERA. AND WHAT'S TERRIBLE IS THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD FROM COVER NINETEEN INTO THE VARIANCE INTO. A POST PANDEMIC REALITY THAT STILL WE HAVE NOT MET YET CALIFORNIA'S MUCH FURTHER ALONG THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. LATINAS REMAIN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT. NOW DURING THE PEAK PANDEMIC LATINAS LEFT THE LABOR FORCE WHEN I DESCRIBE THIS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT LEAVING THE LABOR FORCE IS LIKE DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE THAT MUCH MORE TO GET SOMEBODY EN AND THE REASON THAT THIS MATTERS FOR LATINAS IS THAT THEIR YOUTHFUL THEY'RE LEAVING THE LABOR FORCE NOT. BECAUSE THEY'RE CLOSE TO RETIREMENT DURING THEIR PEAK WORK FORCE THIS IS THE PRIME OF THEIR CAREERS. AND SO LATINAS EXITED THE WORKFORCE AT A RATE THAT WAS NEARLY DOUBLE. THAN WHITE WOMEN. AGAIN LATINAS ARE THE CURRENT AND FUTURE WORK FORCE THEY ALSO. ARE THE BREADWINNERS OF LATINO HOUSEHOLDS DESPITE THE EQUAL PAY GAP SO THIS IS NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT IS AFFECTING. LATINO HOUSEHOLDS IT'S ALL AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE WE SAW FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY DEBT DATA. FROM THE CENSUS THERE IS ONLY ONE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THAT IS NOT GROWING AND THAT'S- WHITE AMERICANS SO OUR ECONOMY IS PREDICATED ON WORKERS OF COLOR. AMERICA'S NEW MAJORITY. NOW OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC LATINAS A YOU KNOW DATE ESSENTIALLY EXPERIENCE THE LARGEST DROP IN LABOR FORCE AND SAID THIS IS THEM ACCIDENT. WHERE A YEAR OUT AND IT HAS NOT RECOVERED AND SO WE HEAR ABOUT HOW THERE ARE A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT CAN'T FILL THEIR JOBS. WELL ONE OF THE THINGS IS THINKING ABOUT WHY THOSE JOBS- ARE NOT WORTH IT SO MANY LATINOS ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA LAUGHTER HOUSE EVERY DAY TO PUT THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. ON THE LINE SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND FOOD ON THEIR TABLE THESE WERE NOT JOBS THAT PROVIDED THE RETIREMENT SECURITY BENEFITS THE SICK PAID LEAVE. THE HEALTH CARE THAT'S QUALITY SO ULTIMATELY GETTING THOSE WORKERS BACK IS GOING TO BE INCUMBENT ON US HAVING GOOD JOBS INCLUDING GOOD UNION JOBS- I KIND OF TOUCHED ON THIS BUT- LATINOS WERE OVERREPRESENTED. IN VULNERABLE LOW WAGE WORK. AND SO THIS IS A THIS IS A BAR CHART THAT SHOWING YOU KNOW THE WOMEN SHARE POPULATION VERSUS THEIR SHARE OF LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY BASED ON. RACIAL ETHNIC STATUS SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT LATINOS ARE OVERREPRESENTED COMPARED TO THEIR SHARE OF THE US POPULATION. THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR BLACK WOMEN. AND SO THESE ARE VULNERABLE INDUSTRIES WE SAW THROUGHOUT TODAY'S HEARING THE ROLE OF BEING ON THE FRONT LINES. THE SEXUAL ASSAULTS THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE GROSS- AN EQUAL ECONOMIC. DEPRIVATION THAT OCCURS FOR THESE WOMEN WORKERS. NOW HERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL IS PASSED THROUGH THE US CONGRESS WILL. REALLY BE A GAME CHANGER LATINA SPENT MORE TIME ON FAMILY CAREVERSUS THEIR MALE PEERS SAID THE LACK OF HAVING. AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE OR ELDERCARE PAID SICK LEAVE YOU NAME IT MEANT THAT IT WAS ALMOST- BETTER IN TERMS OF A SOCIAL UTILITY TO STAY HOME AND GO TO WORK. AND IT WAS JUST ON ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE TO PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE WHEN YOU DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A PROVIDER. I KNOW THINKING ABOUT YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GÓMEZ REYES AND IN THE ROLE OF THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THE LACK OF PROVIDERS THERE IN HOSPITALS. ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO WORK FOR A JOB THAT IS NOT PAIN YOU'RE NOT GIVING YOU SICK LEAVE AND PUT YOUR KIDS AT WRESTLE SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED WE SHOULD NOT BE MAKING WORKERS IN THEIR MOST PRODUCTIVE YEARS MAKE THOSE CHOICES. ESPECIALLY WOMEN WORKERS- I'M NOT SURE SOMETHING IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS IS NOT JUST AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LATINOS THIS IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA. TEXAS AND FLORIDA THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. THERE IS NO U. S. ECONOMY WITHOUT LETTING US SO THE LATINO DONOR COLLABORATIVE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAS CREATED A REMARKABLE REPORT CALLED THE LATINO GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. THEY WERE ABLE. TO CALCULATE THAT THIS YEAR JUST CAME OUT IN SEPTEMBER- IF LATINOS IN THE U. S. WHERE THEIR OWN COUNTRY THEY WOULD BE THE SEVENTH LARGEST GDP IN THE WORLD. THE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDING TWO POINT SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS SO WHEN WE THINKABOUT THE AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING THAT IS LATINOS YEAR AFTER YEAR- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THEY ARE THE GROWTH ECONOMY THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. AGAIN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT IS NOT GROWING THAT IS UNSUSTAINABLE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES THE SECOND ON THE GROWTH IS LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO ON THE LINE. GIVEN NOTHING AS ARE EXITING THE WORKFORCE. SO BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE OUR RESEARCH AT UCLA- ANTICIPATES THAT LATINAS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST 10% OF THE US WORK FORCE. NOT WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT THE NUMBER OF LATINOS IN THE LABOR FORCE IS PROJECTED TO GROW. AT NINE TIMES THE RATE OF THEIR WHITE FEMALE PEERS. AND SO THEY NEED TO BE EMPLOYED IN GOOD JOBS RIGHT GOOD JOBS TO HAVE DISPOSABLE INCOME. TO GROW THE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO CONSUME PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES. NOW WHAT CAN GOVERNMENT DO TO HELP A LOT THERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY GIVEN THE ROBUST ARM RESOURCES SO PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENTS THAT MEET THE MOMENT INCLUDE INCREASING THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE THIS JUST HAS TO HAPPEN- ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE WAY IN WHICH WERE ABLE TO VOTE FOR OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. IN SOME WAYS IT'S PARADOXICAL TO PLACES LIKE FLORIDA WHO VOTE DIFFERENTLY TOP OF THE TICKET BUT HAVE PASSED THROUGH BALLOT INITIATIVES A FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE- IN FRANCHISE MEN IN VOTING RIGHTS FOR THOSE THAT WERE FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND SO SOMETIMES WE CAN LEARN SOMETHING BY LOOKING EAST BUT ULTIMATELY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. AND THE OBLIGATION TO SHAPE WHAT HAPPENS WEST EASTWARD AND SO WITHOUT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS ARE REALLY THINKING ABOUT EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE WHICH I KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA VESTED A LOT THIS LAST LEGISLATIVE CYCLE- MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE AND HOUSEHOLDS ARE AWARE OF THIS CHILD TAX CREDIT SO. EVEN THOUGH WE CREATE THINGS ARE STILL NEEDS TO BE THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS WHETHER IT'S THE UNIONS OR THE HOPES ARE THE MANASA NDA GOES OF THE WORLD THAT CAN ACTUALLY GET THAT MESSAGE OUT AND ENSURE PEOPLE APPLY- AND THEN ULTIMATELY WE NEED TO REINFORCE STATE AND LOCAL I. LAWS THAT SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION. ENFORCEMENT'S A BIG ISSUE SO WE CONTINUE TO HAVE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES AND DISCRIMINATORY ENFORCEMENT AROUND ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WERE ON THE FRONT LINES DOING ESSENTIAL WORK BUT WE'RE NOT INVESTING THE SAME AMOUNT AS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AN OSHA AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE. PLACES THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY NOT BEING VICTIMS OF WAGE THEFT SO THERE NEEDS TO BE AN IMBALANCE THAT IS CORRECTED THERE SO THAT IT BALANCES OUT AND GROWS OUR ECONOMY- I JUST WANT TO CLOSE AND SAY THANK YOU I THINK THAT WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING NOW. WE ALL WILL BE SCREWED. THANKS THANK YOU. THE LAST NIGHT I. AND I WANT TO THE STATE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN TO BE QUITE I'M JUST START BY THAT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I GET FRUSTRATED BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE THINGS WE'VE DONE AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE SUGGESTED WE'VE DONE IT YOU KNOW WE SAID YOU CAN'T ASK ABOUT PRIOR- SALARY SALARY WE SAID THERE'S GOTTO BE SOME TRANSPARENCY- WE WORKED ON THE BILL WIH THEM SO MUCH OF IT WE WORK WITH THAT ARE FORMERSENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON WHO. REALLY LED THE WAY ON A LOT OF THE STUFF YOU KNOW WE'VE EXPANDED PAID LEAVE WE'VE INCREASED THE MINIMUM WAGE I MEAN YOU NAME IT WE'VE DONE IT RIGHT WE CONTINUE TO LEAD AND YET CALIFORNIA IS FURTHER BEHIND AND CONTINUE TO FALL EVEN FARTHER BEHIND THAN THE REST OF THE NATION AND DURING THE PANDEMIC- I MEAN WITH THE NUMBER YOU'LL SEE. YOU KNOW- LATINOS NATIONWIDE WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE CENTS A DOLLAR NOW FIFTY SEVEN I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE SOME OF THE STATE'S IT LIFTED THE MINIMUM WAGE PROBABLY HELPED AND PROBABLY LATINAS WHO DROPPED OUT OF WORKFORCE CHANGE THE NUMBERS UNFORTUNATELY ON FROM THAT BUT EVEN IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THAT HAPPENS- WE'RE STILL FORTY TWO CENTS SO WHAT. AT IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE WE DOING WRONG AND I DO THINK THAT THAT THERE IS DISCRIMINATION BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR SISTERS WHO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN THERE THEY I WOULD ARGUE FACE THE SAME IF NOT MORE DISCRIMINATION AT LEAST EQUAL DISCRIMINATION LEVINE AS SO LIKE WHAT IS IT LIKE WHAT CAN WE DO- WHY IS CALIFORNIA FALLING SO YEAH. WELL I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S FALLING BEHIND BECAUSE WE'RE GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY AND SO IT'S A TALE OF THE RICHES WHICH IN ENDEAVORED THIS HUGE SURPLUS BUT WITH THAT WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE SO THE UNIVERSAL STRATEGY IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE STRATEGY THAT WE NEED TO RELY FULLY ON WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT TARGETS SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE ALL OF THESE THINGS I. I THINK ABOUT THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC SO SURE WE HAD A LOT OF VACCINES BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE VACCINES ACTUALLY GOT TO FRONTLINE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND SO THERE WHAT WAS REQUIRED AS COMMUNITY CLINICS AND NOT INFRASTRUCTURE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND TRUSTED MESSENGERS- SO I THINK THAT THE- IN THE SAN. NEEDS TO GO THE POPULAR. FOR INFORM. VERSUS LETTING IT FIRST IN TIME THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DOUBLE DOWN AND GROWING OUR CIVIL SOCIETY INFRASTRUCTURE. ULTIMATELY WITH THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION WE'RE SEEING THAT PEOPLE'S TRUST IN GOVERNMENT IS NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE IN THOSE NOT ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST MESSENGERS. BUT IF YOU GO TO WORK SITE SERVE YOU'RE GOING TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS- IF YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOLS SCHOOLS ARE REALLY GOOD SITE FOR REACHING LATINO FAMILIES IN ASIAN AMERICAN FAMILIES. BECAUSE THEIR YOUTHFUL THAT COULD PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST AMOUNT OF. TARGETING AND THEN ENSURING YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE AND THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THAT CAN GET THAT MESSAGE. THAT PEOPLE GO FROM ACCESS TO ACTUALLY APPLYING. AND MATRICULATING INTO ANY SORT OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. THANK YOU ARE THEIR DIVISIONAL I'M SURE THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. CRISTINA AND THEN. I THINK THERE'S MORE OF A COMMENT ON YOUR LAST SET OF YOUR RESPONSE- WITH THE VACCINE IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THOSE WITHIN THAT THERE ARE GROUPS ON THE GROUND WHO ARE DOING THE WORK AND ARE THE RESPECTED AND TRUSTED pMESSENGERS I THINK WE HAVE A SYSTEM WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT THAT TRIES TO FORCE A MODEL THAT THIS AND WORK WITH AND WHAT WE HAPPENS I THINK WE NEED TO. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE THINK THAT- IS TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOTHING THERE- WHEN WE NEED THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER TO GIVE ACTINGSOUTH P. P. OR EVEN INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RIGHTS THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE IN SEOUL DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN IDEAS OF HOW WE START TO CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE FROM OUR POSITION- SO THAT WE'RE PUTTING TO WORK THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WE ARE RESOURCE RICH COMMUNITY OUT THERE BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO FOLKS WHO ARE AT THE LIKE THERE'S NOTHING AVAILABLE I'M LIKE WELL THERE'S NOTHING AVAILABLE AND THE WAY THAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN NUMBER THAT HASN'T. WORKED FOR US IN THE WITHIN THAT WATER SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR US SO I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT RATE AND I THINK ABOUT THE PAST NINETEEN MONTHS THAT WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED IN THIS COLLECTIVE PSYCHE THAT IS TRANSFORM THE WAY THAT WE LIVE WORK AND EVEN PLAY- AND SO WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT COBEN NINETEEN IS NOT THE LAST CRISES WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE WILD FIRES WE SEE NOT FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER PUBLIC EPIDEMIC IS GOING TO BE THERE WE KNOW WE HAVE. GROSS HOUSING AND SECURITY AND SO HOW CAN WE STABILIZE OUR CIVIL SOCIETY SECTOR SO THAT THEY CAN BE RESPONSIVE FOR THIS RESEARCH HEAVY- JURISDICTION THAT WERE ANSWER THOSE RESOURCES ACTUALLY PENETRATE SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK ABOUT IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE TIMES WERE DIGITAL MATTERS AND THERE'S TIMES WERE DIGITAL FIRST DOESN'T AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE ACCESS TO SOMETHING SO VITAL THAT IS LIFE OR DEATH SURELY. BASED ON INTERNET AND A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT CULTURALLY COMPETENT OR EASY TO USE AND SOMETHING THAT MAYBE AS EASY FOR TWENTY YEAR OLDS AND THIRTY YEAR OLDS THEY WERE MISSING THE MARK- AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STILL GONNA NEED OBVIOUSLY THAT MOBILIZATION I DO. A LOT OF WORK ON VOTING RIGHTS AND- ELECT. ENGAGE YOU CAN NOT TO PHONE CALLS AND SMS AS THE- ONLY WAY TO. PEOPLE YOU NEED TO DOOR KNOCKING NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. ESPECIALLY IF THE FIRST TIME VOTERS ARE LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS. USE THAT ANALOGY FOR ANY SORT OF GOVERNMENT CRISES RESPONSE IN THE FUTURE. ERIC YOUNG ORGANIZERS. NOT ALL BY TEXT. ELOISE I LOVE HEARING THAT BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE THE OLDER THE OLDER GENERATION TALKS ABOUT IS THE DOOR KNOCKING UP SOMETHING YOU SAID I THINK REALLY RESONATED HE SAID SOME OF THOSE JOBS JUST AREN'T WORTH IT OUR OUR- LATINOS ARE REALIZING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING ABUSED- IT THEY'RE BEING USED IN A WAY THAT IS THAT IS WRONG AND THEY NOW ARE HEARING ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER JOBS AND REALIZE THAT THEY'RE GIVING UP THEIR FAMILY TIME THEY'RE GIVING UP SO MUCH FOR THOSE MENIAL JOBS SO I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT GROWING OUR CIVIL SOCIETY SECTOR. THAT'S IT'S A NEW PHRASE FOR ME. PLEASE TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT YEAH SO THIS CAN BE MAJOR SOCIAL- SERVICES AGENCIES LIKE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA WOULD BEAT THE UNITY COUNCIL- IN THE FRUITVALE SERVICE AGENCIES THAT RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS OR STATE FUNDS TO DO WORK ON YOU CAN THINK ABOUT ON. CHILDCARE SENIOR CITIZENS AFFORDABLE HOUSING- HEAD START THOSE ARE PLACES THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC WERE ESSENTIALLY TRANSITIONING FROM THOSE SERVICES TO GIVING PEOPLE FOOD AND CASH ASSISTANCE. NOW IN ADDITION THERE'S THE CIVIL SOCIETY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AT A REGIONAL LEVEL RIGHT THERE COULD BE PEOPLE- LIKE C. LRA OUR YOU CAN THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT NOT A THINK ABOUT HOPE I ALSO THINK ABOUT PLACES THAT DO WORK FOR YOUTH ENGAGEMENT. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF SOCIAL POLICY THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT BUT THEY'RE NOT GOVERNMENT. BUT THE GREAT THING ISOFTENTIMES THERE BY PARK LEAD. AND THEY'RE BEING LED BY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH YOUR THING YOU'RE DEALING WITH HOUSING AND LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THOSE ARE PLACES TO INVEST SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE MESSAGE OUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE WHEN WE POSITION THIS WITHIN OUR CULTURE AND OUR COMMUNITY IN THE HISTORY OF LATINOS ALWAYS BEING HERE. ONE OF THE GREATEST OUTCOMES OF THE LATINO MOVEMENT WAS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH FIGHTS BECAUSE WE STILL NOW WENT FROM ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES POVERTY ALLEVIATION TO THIS ROBUST NETWORK OF COMMUNITY CLINICS. WHO ARE NOT ONLY PROVIDING HEALTH CARE BUT ARE TELLING PEOPLE WHEN TO VOTE HOW TO REGISTER TO VOTE RIGHT WITH THE AFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT BECAME A HUGE POLITICAL FIGHT IT'S STILL NOT OVER THROUGH THE COURTS BUT THAT'S A PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO ENGAGE. THESE PATIENTS AND YOU CAN DISSEMINATE INFORMATION BECAUSE THERE'S A THRESHOLD YOU KNOW THAT THOSE ARE GOING TO BE LOW INCOME PATIENTS OR THEIR PATIENTS THAT ARE MEDICALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY UNDERSERVED. THANK YOU. YUP IF I MAY WITH THE- FROM HOPE. THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU. VANESSA YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS REPORT THAT YOU ALL HAD PUT TOGETHER- YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT AN ORGANIZATION WAGE EQUITY NOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY AND WAGES IT IS THIS REPORT AVAILABLE TO US ALSO YEAH DEFINITELY ON HOPE'S WEBSITE WE HAVE A SERIES OF LATINA SPECIFIC REPORTS ALL ON- OUR WEBSITE WHICH IS LIKE THE NEST ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF LATINAS REPORT WE ALSO HAVE A TON OF DATA ABOUT LATINOS STARTING MICRO BUSINESSES. AND ENTREPRENEURS THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS SO I WERE BUILDING TOWARDS A LARGER LATINO SPECIFIC DATA HOPE AND WE HOPE TO SEE IT GROW IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND IF I MAY OUR COMMISSIONER. LILIA SOMETHING SHE SAID THERE'S ACTUALLY THE TRUTH AND IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT SCIENCE CENTER HAD TALKED ABOUT IS THAT WE DON'T ALL START ON EQUAL FOOTING AND WE HAVE TO STOP PRETENDING THAT WE'RE STARTING AT THE SAME LEVEL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUALITY EQUALITY IS THE WRONG WORD IT HAS TO BE EQUITY WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY UP TO THE SAME LEVEL BEFORE YOU. YOU START LIFTING EVERYBODY UP- RIGHT. HOLLY FROM THE K. COUNTY COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN ALL RIGHT I WAS ON THE BOARD- AND RECENTLY BUT- THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOME HAS GOT TO BE. A STRONGER VOICE IT HAS TO BE THAT ORGANIZATION THAT THE MEDIA GOES TO ASK FOR AN OPINION. AS AS THEY DO IT SHOULDTO DO FOR HOPE AND MANY OF OUR OTHER- ORGANIZATIONS. BUT THE PRESENCE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON STATUS OF WOMEN. I BELIEVE CAN BE A LOT. CAN BE SO MUCH STRONGER- I THINK ALL OF THESE THE PRESENTERS TODAY. TWENTY OKAY THANK YOU TO THIS THE LAST PANEL INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE. ONE OF THE COMMENTS AT SEVERAL COMMENTS ACTUALLY BUT IN PARTICULAR AT MISSONI IDEAS WITH THESE SILLY LOOKING A POLICY POLITICS INITIATIVE- WITH REGARDS. TO- WITH HOW LATINOS ARE WOMEN SPECIFICALLY ARE NOT EQUAL FOOTING BUT IN MANY WAYS HE SAID SOMETHING THAT MANY FOLKS HAVE TOLD ME- WITH RELATIONS TO MY JOB IN THE ASSEMBLY OUR PRIME EARNING YEARS. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE WAS MOSTLY WHITE WHEN IT WAS MOSTLY MALE UP UNTIL PROP ONE EIGHTY SEVEN TIMES IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR LEGISLATORS HAD. A PENSION THEY HAD HEALTH BENEFITS THEY HAD ALL THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE MOMENT THAT LATINOS BEGAN- GAINING POLITICAL POWER AND MOSTLY AT THE BEGINNING OR THE BEGINNING IT WAS MOSTLY LATINO MEN. AND THEY'RE WITH THE CHEFS THANKS TO MANY OF THE WOMEN HERE IS- INCLUDING OUR OUR CHAIR FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE THERE WAS AN INTENTIONAL SHIFT TO FIND AND ELECT MORE LATINA. INTO THE LEGISLATURE IN THAT TIME. SO MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED PROPOSITIONS HAVE GONE INTO EFFECT WHERE LEGISLATORS NO LONGER HAVE A PENSION. AND NO LONGER HAVE THE BENEFITS THE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS THAT USED TO EXIST AT ONE POINT MEANING THAT AS OUR GOVERNMENT AS WE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT- WHO HAS POWER. AS THE LEGISLATURE TURN TO BE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MORE WOMEN OF COLOR. THE BENEFITS TO THIS POSITION HAVE ALMOST DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY THERE IS NO PENSION WE PAY FOR HEALTHCARE WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME RESOURCE THEM AND BENEFITS THAT USED TO EXIST TO WHITE MEN WHEN THEY WERE IN POWER. MEANING THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AN INTENTIONAL SACRIFICE THAT TAKES PLACE TO BE HERE. I KNOW THAT GIVEN THE GRAPHICS THAT WE SAW TODAY IN MY AGE BRACKET I AM ACTUALLY EARNING LESS THAN WHAT I WAS BEFORE I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND WILL EARN LESS ALSO BASED ON MY AGE BRACKET WHEN I GRADUATED COLLEGE I GRADUATED DURING- BUT LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE COLLEGE AND NOT BE. A STUDENT I WENT IN AND THEN DROPPED OUT BUT IT WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND HARD- COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAL STATE AND THEN FINALLY A GRADUATE SCHOOL. AND I KNOW THAT I AM EARNING LESS THAN THE GENERATIONS THAT CAME BEFORE ME. AND THAT IS A REALITY SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE LATINA PAY EQUITY GAP IN TERMS OF WORKING CLASS WOMEN MIDDLE CLASS EARNERS HIGH INCOME EARNERS THE C. SUITE WHATEVER LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A HUGE GAP. AND EVEN WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE. WHY WOULD WE WANT TO DO THIS JOB IS A HUGE HUGE QUESTION IT TAKES YOU AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY IT TAKES YOU AWAY FROM YOUR COMMUNITY YOUR OFTEN ISOLATED IN SACRAMENTO AND LUCKILY FOR SOME OF US WERE ABLE TO BUILD COMMUNITY AND BE ABLE TO PUSH THINGS FORWARD WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT ALLY SHIP IN PARTNERSHIP. BUT IT IS DIFFICULT AND EVEN WITHIN GOVERNMENT AGAIN TO THE QUESTION AND THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH ANOTHER COLLEAGUE FROM MY VERY AFFLUENT AREA WITH RELATIONS TO COLD IN THE GRAPHICS THAT WE SAW THAT IMPACTED MORE WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR LETTING US SPECIFICALLY AND THAT SIXTY THOUSAND. PLUS PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE OF COAL BUT IN THE LAST NINETEEN MONTHS MOST OF WHOM HAVE BEEN THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND WOMEN. NOT EVERYONE EXPERIENCE THE PANDEMIC IN THE SAME WAY. AND SO I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH A COLLEAGUE FROM AN AFFLUENT AREA WHO WAS TELLING ME THAT- THEY HAD ALL OF THEIR CVS'S AND ALL OF THEIR PHARMACIES HAD THE COVERT VACCINE AND THEY HAD AN OVERSUPPLY MEANWHILE MY COMMUNITY WHICH IS SPLIT BY A FREEWAY ONE SIDE IS AFFLUENT ONE SIDE IS 20% BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE. WE COULDN'T GET THE VACCINE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET MY COMMUNITY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET WE COULDN'T GET AN APPOINTMENT R. DIGER STADIUM IS IN MY DISTRICT ND GO DODGERS THE PLUG. BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CAR. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TURNED YOU HAD TO HAVE PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION TO BE ABLE TO BE IN A LINE FOR HOURS TO RECEIVE A TEST OR TO RECEIVE A VACCINE IF YOU ARE A LOW WAGE WORKER WITHOUT A CAR WHO LIVES IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THERE WAS NO ACCESS TO YOU. FOR A MONTH AND WE WERE HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS EVEN IN SACRAMENTO WE NEED PILOT PROGRAMS WITH COMMUNITY CLINICS AND- OUR SCHOOLS WHICH ARE TRUSTED SITES SO THAT OUR COMMUNITY COULD HAVE ACCESS MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES LIVING. IN ONE HOME GRANDMOTHER MOTHER CHILDREN GRANDKIDS AT TO BE ABLE TO FULLY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS THESE RESOURCES AND IT TOOK MONTHS FOR US TO GET THERE COLLEAGUES AND CONVINCING- THE SACRAMENTO STRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE EVEN PILOT PROGRAMS. TO PIVOT THIS GIANT TECTONIC THAT WE KNEW WAS IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES THE MOST THIS IS WHY THIS CONVERSATION IS IMPORTANT THIS IS WHY THE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE NOT HAPPENING IN A PUBLIC WAY AND HAVE BEEN LACKING FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND I THINK THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND AN INCREDIBLE POWERFUL DIRECTION. TO BE ABLE TO REALLY SIGNIFY THAT IN ORDER FOR OUR COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE AND IF WE ARE TRULY GOING TO LOOK AT LEVINE AS BEING THE LARGEST POPULATION IN THE STATE AND THE- THE BREADWINNERS AND MANY FAMILIES AND THE LATINO COMMUNITY GROWING BEING THE FASTEST GROWING. POPULATION ACROSS THE NATION THEN IT IS A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TIED WITH ECONOMIC JUSTICE INCOME INEQUALITY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- AND CLEARLY REPRESENTATION THAT MATTERS AND THAT BRINGS THOSE VOICES TO THE TABLE SO I'M JUST I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH WORK AND SO MANY IDEAS THAT ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS HEARING TODAY AND HOW WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE. SESSION IN JUST A FEW MONTHS THANK YOU THANK YOU. READY M. I'M A FIRM. GIVE ME I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN. WELL SOME IS THE START BREEDING. GET YOUR OWN BREATH BACK IN YOUR MOUTH THIS ALWAYS GOOD- I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN AND NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL- WHEN I FIRST STARTED TO GET INVOLVED IN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THERE WAS THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHITE MEN. AND THE FACT THAT AFTER AMERICAN MEN COULDN'T KEEP PACE AND IT WAS CHAU LOS SIX- I'M OLDER THAN A LOT OF UNITS FROM CHAU. HI THIS IS WHEN WE HAD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. THEN IT BECAME A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WHAT WHITE WOMEN WERE OUTPACING BLACK MEN AND NEITHER ONE OF US IS CATCHING UP WITH WHITE MEN- AND NOW. WHEN I BRING THIS UP ABOUT YOU KNOW BRING IT BACK FROM A FACTION FOR WOULD WE NEED TO DO TO BE INTENTIONAL. SO THAT WE COULD WE COULD EVEN THINGS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS INTERESTING I WOULD GET PUSHED BACK. FROM WHITE MEN WHO WOULD SAY YEAH BUT LOOK A BLACK WOMEN. IN A RESEARCH ISSUE THAT SHOWED A BLACK WOMAN WERE OUTPACING WHITE MEN GOING TO COLLEGE THEIR ORDER DO MORE BLACK WOMEN ON BOARDS IN THE BLACK MEN. BOB MY SISTERS ARE DEFINITELY DOING SOME RIGHT. THEY ARE STARTING TO FIGURE THIS COMPLEX THING OUT OR ITS INTENTIONAL LIKE THEY THE PREDOMINATE GROUP ONLY WANT TO WHITE WOMEN ON BOARDS ONLY WANT TO WORK HAVE THEM GET CONTRACT. NOW MAYBE IT'S SHIFTED TO THAT BUT I AND THIS IS PROBABLY MORE FOR THE UCLA POLICY INITIATIVE TO. LET'S NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL LET'S SEE WHAT HAS GONE ON IN THE PAST LET'S EXAMINE WHY. BLACK WOMEN WHITE WOMEN FIRST NOW BLACK WOMEN ARE STARTING TO MOVE UP. AND THEN AND THEN OBVIOUSLY ELIMINATE WHATEVER THOSE WHO DOES DOES PREJUDICIAL BARRIERS TO KEEP CERTAIN GROUPS DOWN THE THIRD RISING HAVE LISTED TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY TO RISE A ONE TIME THEY PICK AND CHOOSE. WHO THEY WANT TO RISE AT A CERTAIN TIME BUT ALWAYS KEEP A CERTAIN SEGMENT. DOWN OR PUSH THEM DOWN AND SO. I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME VALUABLE LESSONS. THAT AND I'VE ALWAYS SUGGESTED THAT WE STARTED LOOK AT HOWLAND. AFTER MEREKA WOMEN HAVE BECOME EXTREMELY POWERFUL WHETHER IT'S- STACEY ABRAMS TADESE HOLLY MITCHELL TO THE WEST WE HAVE SOME. POWERFUL WOMEN AND EVEN WITH MY LATINA GROUP THAT ADVISES ME ON WHAT I NEED TO DO EVERY DAY. SOME OF SITTING HERE- THEY WOULD SAY YOU KNOW AFTER AMERICANS YOU GUYS ARE REALLY FORCEFUL WAY MAYBE CUT BECAUSE OUR WOMEN. ARE REALLY STRONG AND FORCEFUL AND THEY'RE LEADING THE WAY A LOT OF WAYS. AND SO WERE YOU KNOW WE MATTER JUST HOLDING ONTO THE COAT TAILS IN THIS GOING GETTING THROUGH THE DOOR MAYBE WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT. THE PRACTICES THE PROCEDURES OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO GET TO THAT NEXT LEVEL AND THEN SHARE THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH EVERYONE SO WE CAN BRING OURSELVES UP. AND NOT. DEPEND ON ANYBODY ELSE. RUSSIAN YES THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SECOND PANEL AS WELL IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE I MEAN I'M A POWER POINT GIG SO I LOVE THE SLIDES I THINK ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WE HAVE A TALK SO MUCH ABOUT BECAUSE YES WE HAVE A BOSS YES WE NEED MORE ENFORCEMENT YES THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO BUT THERE'S A WHOLE GAP THAT I THINK WAS MENTIONED AND I DON'T WANT TO FALL AWAY IT'S ABOUT THE RESKILLING AND UPSKILLING- OF LATINOS TO ENSURE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT THE CHANGE IN THE WORK FORCE. TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE ALSO PROFITING FROM ALL THE CHANGES IN EDUCATION AND- AND TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION CHALLENGES ARE GOING ON THE STATE SO I LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT AND HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT IN MAKING SURE THAT THE- LAND AND SEA LATINOS AND **** GETS HOME. THE BOARD BANANA THING YOU ALL YOUR YOU'RE ALWAYS ARE ADJACENTLY TINA- I SAY THAT WITH MUCH LOVE AS YOU KNOW I JUST I BEFORE WE AND THIS HEARING AND I WANT TO POINT OUT I YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMITTEE CLINICS AND- WE HAVE ON A MEDICAL SAID HERE FROM ANY FUTURE HEALTH CLINIC AND REALLY PARTNER. I MEAN TO BE HONEST WE SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO DURING THE PANDEMIC AND I THINK I MADE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES JEALOUS BECAUSE WE HAD A UNIQUE SITUATION WE HAD- JUST A NEWLY ELECTED LIKING A SUPERVISOR FOR THE FIRST TIME- AND- WE- HADN'T. AT THE TIME THE CHAIR LATINO CAUCUS WHO- HAPPEN TO SLEEP WITH THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CHAIR. SO HE GOT HERE AND EVERY DAY. BUT IT WAS THAT INTENTIONALITY I YOU KNOW EARLY ON WE THOUGHT WITH THE TESTING SO WE STARTED SAYING ON THE VACCINES LIKE IT CAN'T JUST BE. ONE SIZE FITS ALL THERE HAS TO BE A DIRECTIVE- FOR THE SOUTH BAY. AND I'M IN ACTUALLY I'D LOVE TO SEE THE DATA I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED EXPLORER. BECAUSE WE WERE HOUSED IN THE SOUTH BAY WE REALLY DID A GOOD JOB IN THE SOUTH BAY OF- AND PRESSURING THE COUNTY BOARD. TO TAKE CARE OF OUR FOLKS IN TO BE DELIVERED THAT WE HAVE THAT SOME OF HIGH SPEC SEEN RATES IN FACT WE'RE WE'RE- BASICALLY FOR ELIGIBLE- ADULTS IN IN THE SOUTH BAY SOUTH OF THE- NINETY FOUR. WE'RE ALMOST AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET A 100% VACCINATED BASICALLY- AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS INTENTIONAL AND WE WORKED SO HARD ON THAT. BUT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING EVEN TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN NORTH COUNTY WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE REPRESENTATION NECESSARILY AND WE TRIED I MEAN I- YOU KNOW YOU YOU TEND TO FOCUS ON WHERE YOU LIVE- IN AND- HAVING. ORIGINALLY COME FROM THE NORTH CAN WILL WORK WITH TOUCH AND TRY TO GET SOME THINGS BUT WE WERE A LITTLE DELAYED- AND SO IT'S INTERESTING HOW IMPORTANT REPRESENTATION IS OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR COMMUNITY CLINICS OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH. OUR NGOS- BUT I'M I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DEAL- BUT IT'SNOT ENOUGH AND WE CAN'T STOP SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE WORDS THAT ALWAYS COME OUT- THE INTENTIONALITY. UNAPOLOGETIC I'M REPRESENTATION BY LATINOS. WE NEED FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW I THINK. I THINK CRISTINA GARCIA AND SOME OTHERS ALLUDED TO IT WE RIGHT WHEN I STARTED LEGISLATURE WE HAVE FIVE LATINOS IN BOTH HOUSES. AND WE DID START TO- AND THEN WE LOST TWO AND WE START TO WORRY WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN I MEAN HERE WE WERE THE LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC CALIFORNIA. AND WE WERE- YOU KNOW LESS THAN 2% OF LEGISLATORS. AND WE MADE THE INTENTIONAL DECISION TO ASK OUR MALE COLLEAGUES LATINO MALE COLLEAGUES TO REPLACE THEMSELVES WITH A LATINA- AND OVER THE YEARS THE- GOOD LORD NINE YEARS WE'VE BEENTHERE- LEVINE IS NOW OUT NUMBER LET THE NOTE IN THE LEGISLATURE CLOSE TO TWENTY SO WE'RE- WE'RE NOT YET. AT OUR REPRESENTATIVE PROPORTION BUT DEFINITELY HAVE MADE A HUGE DENT. WITHOUT BECAME BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY WE BEAT THE DRUM EVERY SINGLE DAY WE SAID WE HAVE TO ELECT LATINAS WE HAVE TO LET LEVINE AS- AND- IT. IT S. RUFFLES FEATHERS AND IT BOTHERS PEOPLE BUT THAT'S I THINK WHAT THIS COMMITTEE IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT SEEN AT THIS EVERY DAY. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE LEARNED FROM OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN SISTERS IS- THIS UNAPOLOGETIC. QUESTS TO ENSURE. THAT LATINAS DON'T GO UNSEEN- WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT THESE HEARINGS EVERY TIME I HEAR IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE. IT YOU KNOW WE SPENT A YEAR NOW- AND I SEE SONYA HIGHLIGHTING THE PROBLEM GETTING ALL OF A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE YEAR WHERE WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO INTENTIONALLY- TARGET. LATINOS AND WE HOPE YOU'LL WILL HAVE ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT IN DOING SO. I'M THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT AND AS PROMISED. TWO MINUTES TILL TWO THIRTY WE'RE DONE. OKAY. AT THE END OF YOUR ACCOUNT WITHIN THE TRACK. OKAY HI. TELL ME.
