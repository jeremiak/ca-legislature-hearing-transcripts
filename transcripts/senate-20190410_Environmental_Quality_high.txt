VOTES BUT I HAVE THERE ARE A LOT OF BUSY THINGS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUPLE TODAY SO I THINK IT'S BEST THAT WE JUST GET STARTED. SO. WITH THAT I SEE ARE THE CENTER MORALE HERE IN YOUR EYES. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A CENTER BECAUSE WE ARE SO LET'S LET'S ASK GENERAL COME UP PRESENT ITEM TO THIS IS SB. THREE EIGHTY FOUR WELL WE DON OF OKAY WE'LL CALL WE'LL CALL ATTENDANCE AND ALLEN HERE ALLEN HERE BATES. BATES PRESENT HELLO. SKINNER STERN. TONE I CASCADE. OKAY SO WE HAVE A QUORUM YET BUT WE HOPEFULLY WILL SOON. THE CENTER MORALE -- IS HERE TO PRESENT ITEM TWO IN YOUR PACKETS MEMBERS SP. THREE EIGHTY FOUR I'M ACTUALLY IN HOUSING. MAYBE SEE WHEN YOU'RE READY. GIVE ME ANOTHER TWENTY MINUTES. YEAH IF YOU WERE WITH YOU ALSO I'M JUST A MAJOR JOKE OKAY I GUESS I FUNNY ONE ALL RIGHT. GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SP THREE EIGHTY FOUR PROPOSES A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO FIXING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. FIRST DOES TWO THINGS IT STREAMLINES THE SICK WORK PROCESS FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. OF FIFTY UNITS ARE MORE ACCORDING THIS SAME PROCESS THIS -- LEGISLATURE HAS USED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THE X. BY -- TO SPEED UP -- SPORTS ARENAS. AND INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX FILERS CAN EXCLUDE. UP FROM THERE. STATE INCOME TAX REMOTE -- FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS I UNDERSTAND WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE SEQUEL COMPONENTS OF MY BILL TODAY SO I WILL FOCUS ON TESTIMONY THERE. WE ARE ALL AWARE THE CALIFORNIA DOES FACE A HOUSING CRISIS ACCORDING APARTMENT HOUSING. AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE AN ANNUAL PRODUCTION SHORTFALL OF NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES MEDIUM HOME PRICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA NOW. HAVE DOUBLE THAT OF THE AVERAGE PRICE IS -- ACROSS AMERICA WERE WERE RIGHT AT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND WE ALSO HAVE -- THE THIRD LOWEST HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE. IN BROWN. THE COUNTRY COMPOUNDING THIS PROBLEM IS THE SEQUEL PROCESS WHICH HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AS A ROADBLOCK -- TO DEVELOPMENT -- WE CAN ALL AGREE I BELIEVE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS THE INTENT OF SEQUEL -- BUT TOO OFTEN IT'S SIMPLY USE TO DELAYED DEVELOPMENT ALL TOGETHER WHICH IS WHY THE LAW. AND PROCESS NEED SIGNIFICANT REFORMS -- THE LEGISLATION REFORM SEEMS TO BE OUT OF REACH THE LEGISLATURE HAS REPEATEDLY SPED UP THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. FOR HIGH PROFILE PROJECTS LIKE SPORTING ARENAS WHICH I HAVE SUPPORTED HOWEVER WE CAN TAKE THAT ACTION WHY NOT DO SO FOR MUCH NEEDED RESIDENTIAL UNITS THEY GET TIED DOWN AND LIKELY -- EXPENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OUR LAWSUITS IT'S CLEARLY A BI PARTISAN POSITION AND SO WHAT SP THREE EIGHTY FOUR DOES AS FOLLOWS THE GOVERNOR'S CALL -- IN HIS TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH IN WHICH HE SAID IN RECENT YEARS -- BASICALLY SAYS WE NEED TO SPEED UP THE SEQUEL PROCESS FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTING IT'S TIME WE DO THE SAME THING. FOR HOUSING AND AND I JUST WANT TO ADD ON THAT TOO IN OUR YOUNGER GENERATION ONE OF THE HIGHEST -- DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE LEAVING OUR STATE ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED YOUNG PROFESSIONALS BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY NINE AND ONE REASON IS -- F. HOUSING VERY EXPENSIVE CALIFORNIA SO ANYWAY -- THREE EIGHTY FOUR IS A STRAIGHT FORWARD STEP -- WE CAN TAKE TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND IT WILL INSURE EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW FOR SICK WELL WAIVERS ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS WITH FIFTY OR MORE UNITS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR HIGH BOTH HIS HELP STREAMLINE DEVELOPMENT SO WE CAN BEGIN TO BUILD. HOUSING OUR CONSTITUENTS WANT AND NEED AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE D. AS CASSIE GILSON REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA -- BUILDING INDUSTRY. HEY KATHY HI. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. APOLOGIZE FOR THE FLY IN A LOT OF COMMITTEES THIS MORNING. I AM. THE AUTHOR IS BRINGING FORWARD AN ISSUE. THAT WE TALK ABOUT INFORMALLY ALL THE TIME WHICH IS. YOU KNOW WE SEE A SERIES OF I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM A STADIUM BILLS. THEY SOMETIMES APPLIED TO OTHER THINGS. WE ARE WE DO. LITIGATION SEEK WITH STREAMLINING. THE QUESTION IS A FOUR WHEEL BEFORE PREPARED TO ADMIT THAT. DOES MAKE A PROJECTS NEED SOME STREAMLINING IN THEIR SICKLE REVIEW -- WHEN WE HAD A HOUSING CRISIS OF THE MAGNITUDE THAT I THINK THAT ANALYSIS LAYS OUT WELL? WHY WOULDN'T WE CONSIDER DOING SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT -- FOR HOUSING -- THE A COMMENT ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES IN IN THE ANALYSIS THE FIRST IS I THINK WE OFTEN FRAMED THIS DEBATE -- IN A MANNER THAT'S TOO HYPERBOLIC IT'S C. QUICK IS THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS OR SEEK WHAT IS NOT A CAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS AND THE ANSWER IS IT'S NOT A BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS. IT IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR -- AND THOSE OF YOU THAT COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT KNOW THAT WHEN YOU SAT ON WHEN YOU SAT ON CITY COUNCILS AND BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS AND YOU SEE THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN THE NUMBER OF HOUSING PROJECTS THAT COME BEFORE YOU -- IN SEQUELLITIGATION -- YOU KNOW WE ALSO CAN PLAY I HAVE A STUDY THAT SAYS ACTS AND I HAVE A STUDY THAT SAYS WHY AND THAT'S PROBABLY NOT SO FRUITFUL FOR DISCUSSION. I'M THE THING THAT I IN THE ANALYSIS PARTICULARLY THAT I WANTED TO COMMENT ON WAS. THIS IDEA THAT WE'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SEQUEL STREAMLINING N THE BUILDING AND WHY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH -- SEQUEL ACTUALLY BEFORE WE DID THE WHOLE HOST OF ADDITIONAL -- EXEMPTIONS AND STREAMLINING CAME WITHOUT SOME VERY THOUGHTFUL STREAMLINING WHEN IT WAS FIRST ENACTED AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT -- CREATIVE ATTORNEYS HAVE FOUND WAYS AROUND IT I I SORT OF ANALOGIZE IT TO THE TAX CODE IS THAT PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND THEN PEOPLE ARE CREATIVE AND THEN WE HAVE TO KEEP. SORT OF COMING BACK AND LEGISLATING AROUND LOOPHOLES AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT -- THE MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECORATION DECLARATION WHICH IS PROBABLY THAT SORT OF PARAMOUNT SEAQUEST REMINDING ISSUE. IS A TERRIFIC IDEA BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THAT. IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT IF YOU'RE DOING AN INFILL HOUSING IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN INFILL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OR YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW A LARGE INDUSTRIAL REFINERY OR OTHER PROJECT IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OUGHT TO REFLECT. THE MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE IN THOSE PROJECTS AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT FOR MANY HOUSING PROJECTS. WHO MIGHT WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH A MEDICATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION THERE? IN A SITE THAT'S KNOWN FOR HOUSING MORE CONTEMPLATED IN A PLAN. IF THERE IS LOCAL CONTROVERSY AROUND THE PROJECT SOMETIMES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WON'T EVEN LET YOU PROCEED WITH YOUR MEDICATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION AND THEY WILL SAY TO YOU DIRECTLY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE -- ANALYTICAL TOOL WITHIN SEA QUEST BUT GIVEN THE CONTROVERSY WE KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE LITIGATION SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO AN E. I. R. FROM THE BEGINNING. AND SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE IN FOR THE OTHER -- STREAMLINING -- THAT'S NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS I COULD SHARE SIMILAR STORIES -- AND THEN I THINK THE FINAL THING I'LL SAY IS THAT. THE REASON. THAT -- THE APPROACHING THIS BILL FRANKLY WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE KINGS ARE WE KNOW WHERE WE WE ARE FORESEEN IS BECAUSE I THINK FOLKS RECOGNIZE THAT THE GOAL IS NOT -- TO GET OUT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS APPROACH THAT LOWERS ANY ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS LOWERS AND NAME -- MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS OR IN ANY WAY CONSTRAINS -- THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WHICH IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF SEEK WHAT YOU DO YOU PREPARE YOUR DOCUMENT YOU HAVE A PUBLIC MEETINGS ABOUT IT GOES BEFORE THE COUNCIL AND WHAT THIS REALLY FOCUSES ON IS SEQUEL LITIGATION ABUSE. TRYING TO MAKE THAT PROCESS GO FASTER AND MAKE CLEAR AND I THINK THAT THIS IS ESPECIALLY COMPELLING IN A HOUSE IN CONTEXT. BUT IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAS SAID YES WE WANT THIS HOUSING PROJECT AND WE WANT THIS HOUSING PROJECT IN THIS SITE. IF PEOPLE RAISE ISSUES THAT ABOUT IT IN LITIGATION IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT IF THE COURT FINDS THAT. ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION IS NECESSARY THAT THE PROJECT SHOULD HAVE TO DO IT BUT THERE IS NO REASON. TO HOLD UP THE ENTIRE PROJECT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS AND SOME WILL SAY WELL IF YOU START THE PROJECT AND YOU MIGHT DO DAMAGE IN THE MEANTIME WHAT THE BILL IS CRAFTED IN SUCH A WAY TO ENSURE. THAT -- IF THERE IS -- YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS IF THERE ARE ISSUES RELATED TO SACRED SITES THAT FRANKLY CAN'T GET UNDONE THOSE ARE THINGS FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS APPROPRIATE SO. APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR T MAKING THIS CONVERSATION A LITTLE MORE PUBLIC AND AS FOR YOUR I FELT. I THINK I AGREE WITH WHAT HE SAID -- FOLKS WANT TO WEIGH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING YELLING EVER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE'RE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE AN OPPOSITION RAISE. OPPOSITION THE BILL. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WITNESSES ADDRESS ARRANGE WITH YOURSELF THEN WE'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE THAT ON SO IF YOU COULD. CREATE SOME SPACE OF THE DICE I'M SORRY IT'S SO [inaudible] BUSY HERE [inaudible] OKAY. YOU MAY PROCEED WHILE THEY FIGURE OUT [inaudible] WITH JOHN. MORNING JOE REMEMBERS TEN POUND FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION. THE COUNCIL'S OPPOSITION TO SB THREE EIGHTY FOUR AND THE OTHER PENDING BILLS YOU'RE HAVING. AT THIS MORNING IS LIMITED TO THE COURT IMPACTS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT INTERFERENCE. WITH THE COURT'S FUNDAMENTAL DUTY TO PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN ALL OTHER CASES ON THE COURT'S DOCKET. THIS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY ULTRA CALENDAR PREFERENCE HAS THE PRACTICAL EFFECT. OF PUSHING ALL OFTHE CASES ON THE COURT'S DOCKET TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. EVEN CASES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY PRIORITIZE JUST FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. THE HOMEOWNER IF AN ACTION WAS BROUGHT INTO THE HOME OWNER BILL OF RIGHTS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HOUSING OBVIOUSLY THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED A VERY BROAD PACKAGE COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE TO TRY TO PROTECT PEOPLE. FROM THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS IN IMPROPER FORECLOSURES SEVEN ACTION UNDER THE HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS. OR AN INSURANCE BAD FAITH OR OTHER CLAIMS BROUGHT BY HOMEOWNERS WHO'VE LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE RECENT DEVASTATING FIRES IN SANTA ROA. OR THE MUD SLIDES IN SANTA BARBARA THOSE CASES MOVED TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. OTHER HOUSING RELATED CASES FOR EXAMPLE HOUSING DISCRIMINATION OR AN EIGHTY A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY PEOPLE WITH MENTAL OR OTHER DISABILITIES. IN FACT THERE WAS A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES WHERE THIS US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. FOUND ONGOING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST A AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES SO THAT LITIGATION WOULD MOVE TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES AND NON HOUSING RELATED AREAS WOULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED FOR EXAMPLE. A PERSONAL INJURY ACTION INVOLVING A SEVERELY BRAIN DAMAGED CHILD. ELDER ABUSE LITIGATION INVOLVING DYING PLAINTIFFS CIVIL ACTIONS INVOLVING HUMAN TRAFFICKING WAGE THEFT. THE I COULD GIVE MANY MANY EXAMPLES THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT CASES ON THE COURT'S DOCKET THIS WILL ALL TAKE LONGER TO DECIDE WITH THIS SUPER XCELERATED CALENDAR PREFERENCE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE -- THIS XCELERATED COUNT CALENDAR PREFERENCE OF SECRET CUSE OF ACTION WILL NOT PROVIDE. THE SECURITY THAT THE PROPONENTS ARE SEEKING. THE JUSTIFICATION THAT WE'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY TIMELINE IS THE CERTAINTY THAT SUPPOSEDLY WOULD COME. WITH THE LITIGATION BEING COMPLETELY WRAPPED UP. IN A IN THIS RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT OUR EXPERIENCE IN ACTUAL A. B. NINE HUNDRED STREAMLINING CASES IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE THEIR LITIGATION AGAINST THE WARRIORS ARENA. AND THE LITIGATION AGAINST THE EIGHTY ONE FIFTY SUNSET BOULEVARD PROJECT BOTH HAD MULTIPLE LAWSUITS MULTIPLE CAUSES OF ACTION WHERE THE SEQUEL PORTION. WAS ON THE SUPER ACCELERATED TIMELINE BUT THE REGULAR -- NON SEQUEL PORTIONS OF THE LITIGATION PROCEEDED UNDER THE USUAL CIVIL PROCEDURE TIME LINES NOT PROVIDING THE CERTAINTY THAT. IS SUPPOSEDLY THE CORNERSTONE FOR THIS APPROACH. THE COUNCIL ALSO IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL IN THE SIMILAR BILLS YOU'LL BE CARRYING THAT SEVERELY LIMIT. THE COURT'S ABILITY TO ISSUE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE JUDGES TO HEAR THESE CASES WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS VERY COMMON NOT FOR THE ENTIRE -- SEQUEL PROCESS THE BIT TO HAVE BEEN DONE IMPROPERLY BUT THAT THERE MAY BE ONE OR TWO ITEMS. THAT ARE IN NEED OF FIXING AND THAT ARE TARGETED IN JUNCTION IS ISSUED TO TAKE CARE OF JUST THOSE SO WHAT THESE LIMITS ON INJECTED RELIEF TO THE STATE. JUDGE REGARDLESS OF THE FACTS. AND REGARDLESS OF THE LAW THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY APPLY IN THESE CASES YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED FROM ISSUING THAT TARGETED IN JUNCTION INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. YOU CAN ONLY ENFORCE AN INJUNCTION OR ISSUE AN INJUNCTION IN CASES WHERE -- THE IMMINENT THREAT OF PUBLIC CALMER INTERFERENCE WITH NATIVE AMERICAN ARTIFACTS WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO COME UP -- IN IN MANY CASES IN PRACTICE. SO THOSE THOSE -- CONSTRAINTS -- INTERFERE WITH THE COURT'S INHERENT AUTHORITY TO FASHION APPROPRIATE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND IT RAISES A SERIOUS SEPARATION OF POWERS -- QUESTION FINALLY WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTREMELY BROAD SCOPE OF THIS IN THE OTHER BILLS YOU'RE HEARING TODAY. TO DATE. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE SUPER XCELERATED TIMELINES HAVE ONLY APPLIED TO A TOTAL. OF FIFTEEN PROJECTS TEN THAT HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED UNDER A B.. NINE HUNDRED ANGLE WITH AN ACE PROJECTS THAT WERE ENACTED LAST YEAR. AND THE CAPITOL BUILDING IN ACTS AND RELATED STATE OFFICE BUILDING PROJECTS -- OR TO DATE -- THE ONLY PROJECTS HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR THIS SUPER STREAMLINING APPROACH -- THE DEFINITION OF WHICH PROJECTS ARE ELIGIBLE ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS BILL IS INCREDIBLY BROAD AND SO THE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON LITIGANTS ON OUR DOCKET -- EVERY SINGLE DAY IN ALL OF OUR COURTS WOULD REALLY BE MUCH MORE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF YOU WERE TO APPLY THIS SUPER XCELERATED SCHEME TO THIS VERY LARGE CATEGORY PROJECT THE FINAL THING I'D MENTION THIS. AND THEN MY GOOD FRIEND MS GILSON OF REFERENCE THE ANALYSIS THE MIDDLE SISTER IS A VERY GOOD JOB OF POINTING OUT WHAT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS WITH RESPECT TO SEEK WITH. THINK WHAT ISSUES ARE OUTSIDE OUR PURVIEW BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS THE ANALYSIS FOUND OUT THAT IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE CURRENTLY SUPPORTS. OF THE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF THIS PARTICULAR -- KIND OF LEGISLATION AND IN LIGHT OF THAT INFORMATION AND ALL OF THE REASONS THAT I JUST -- RECOUNTED THE COUNCIL MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL AND ASK FOR YOUR NUMBER THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU YES SIR -- YES BRENNAN DAWSON WAS HERE COULD CALIFORNIA THANK YOU TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THEIR HARD WORK ON THE BILLS TODAY AND PUTTING UP MY BADGERING ON MY CONCERNS FOR THE BILL -- FOR THE REASONS STATED BY OUR FRIENDS OUR JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE ALSO OPPOSE SB TO EIGHTY FOUR A WE AGREE THE SP THREE EIGHTY FOUR WOULD BE BAD FOR THE COURTS BUT WE GO FURTHER IN OPPOSITION AND HOLD THAT. WOULD ACTUALLY BE BAD FOR SEQUEL IN GENERAL -- OUR FIRST CONCERN IS THE BROAD NATURE WHICH MR PONE RT SPOKE -- TO SECOND WE WOULD NOTE THAT -- SP THREE EIGHTY FOUR IS NO A. B.. NINE HUNDRED SB THIRTY FOUR LIKE MANY OF THE BILLS THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF THAT WILL COME BEFORE YOU TODAY -- IS MODELED AFTER CERTAIN REVISIONS IN EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED RICH AWARDED CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT MET RIGOROUS ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WITH EXPEDITED YOU JUDICIAL REVIEW. OF SIERRA CLUB OPPOSE AB NINE HUNDRED BECAUSE IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT THAT'S ABOUT POLICY GENERALLY HOWEVER WE WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT EVEN THAT BILL PROVIDED CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. AND THAT ESPY TWO EIGHTY FOUR DOES NOTHING OF THE SORT. THE BILL ONLY REQUIRES -- CERTAIN -- ASPECTS WITH REGARD TO HOUSING UNITS BUT DOES NOTHING TO REQUIRE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE GARDEN BARMAN PROTECTION -- AND SECOND SP THREE EIGHTY FOUR WE WOULD ARGUE FOR SAKES ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOR THIS SEQUENCE FORCING MECHANISMS -- SP THREE TO FOUR DOES NOT PROVIDE I MEAN DOES NOT PROVIDE IT SEQUEL EXEMPTION PER SE AN ASSET SEQUEL SEQUEL WOULD. PROPONENTS WOULD HAVE TO UNDERGO SEQUEL PROCESS THESE HOWEVER IT DOES APPLY TO THE JUDICIAL REVIEW PORTION OF THE SECRET PROCESS WHICH IS. THE ONLY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT SECRET PROVIDES -- ALTHOUGH SECRET FOR REVIEW -- WELL THE SEEKER V. PROVIDE COMMUNITIES WITH RECORD A REQUISITE OPPORTUNITIES PARTICIPATING PUBLIC PROCESS HE'S MITIGATE TOMORROW DISTRESS AND DEGRADATION MANY COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES. RELY ON SEQUEL LITIGATION AS ITS ONLY MEANS OF FOR SALON INSURE THAT THE AIR THEY BREATHE IN THE WATER THEY DRINK IS CLEAN. AT THREE THIRTY FOURS INTERFERENCE WITH THE JUDICIAL PROCESSES WILL HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IN AFFECT FOR THESE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY THAT WHEN IT COMES TO LIMITING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. LITIGATION BROUGHT PURSUANT TO SEEK WORK IN MATERIALLY AFFECT HOW LEAD AGENCY CONCLUDES THAT THE PROJECT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE. AND AS SUCH A PROJECT AND CHANGE YOU TO LITIGATION BASED ON C. QUOTE -- BECAUSE THE PROJECT AND CHANGE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS OFTEN GRANTED BY A COURT TO PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO UNTIL DETERMINATION OF THE MERITS OF THE SECRET JOHNSTON UP CAN BE MADE. SINGER ENJOYING CONSTRUCTION OF A PROJECT IS OFTEN NECESSARY TO PREVENT FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AS WELL CONTAINING ANY ONGOING DEGRADATION -- ENCLOSING MANY DEVELOPERS AND MANY LEGISLATORS INCLUDING THE AUTHOR HAS STATED A VARIATION OF THE FOLLOWING. IF WE CAN GIVE EXPEDITED JUST REVIEW TO STADIUMS WE CAN GIVE IT TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT ALTHOUGH I COMMEND THESE ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE STATEMENT FOR THEIR ONE EIGHT FOR THE DESIRE TO BE CONSISTENT. OF THE POLICY OF TRADING A BENEFIT TO DEVELOPERS FOR AN UPPER PLAINS OPPORTUNITY FULLY HEARD AND RECEIVE THEIR PREFERRED OUTCOME -- IS NOT IS NOT A POLICY THAT WE WOULD HAVE -- TO PROMOTE -- IT WAS A BAD POLICY IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN IT WAS DESIGNED AND IT'S ABOUT POLICY TODAY. SO I UNDERSTAND A NONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY ACTUALLY VOTED ON THAT POLICY HOWEVER YOU DO HAVE THE CHANCE. TO REJECT THE NOTION OF EXTENDING THAT POLICY TO OTHER DEVELOPMENT AS WELL -- AND LASTLY WE JUST ALSO NOTE THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS WHEN IT COMES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE REGARDING SEQUELS EFFECT ON THAT OCCASION AND HOW. HOW OLD LITTLE AS SICK REALIZATION IS ACTUALLY OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF PER THE -- AG'S OFFICE ITSELF HAS SAID THAT THERE IS LESS THAN TWENTY CASES PER YEAR WHEN IT COMES TO SIMPLIFICATION. AND EVEN OF THOSE CASES -- LESS THAN 1% OF THOSE ACTUALLY FIND. THAT SEQUEL LITIGATION IS THAT PROBLEM FOR DEVELOPMENT AND SO WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB THREE EIGHTY FOUR YOUR I HAVE OTHER FOLKS WHEN I'M WAS OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MY NAME IS CHELSEA TO I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AND ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO OPPOSE SP -- THREE EIGHTY FOUR EXPEDITING LEGAL ACTIONS LAMENTING JUDICIAL REMEDIES WILL NOT ONLY HURT VARMINT BUT WILL HURT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. AS EUROPEAN ARMOR MO JUSTICE ALLIES OFTEN RELY ON THE COURTS TO PROTECT COMMUNITY HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IS DEPENDENT UPON. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR WHERE THE OPPOSITION. THAILAND IS THE NUMBER MICHAEL'S WORKING OR NOT. TO BE CLEAR BUT WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO HOUSING PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT SICK WAS NOT THE PROBLEM TO HOUSING PRODUCTION -- I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE READ THE STUDY -- BY THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS OF SURVEY OF COUNTIES AND CITIES SHOWING THAT HOUSE IN HOUSING CRISIS PERSISTS. DUE TO THE PRIMARY FACTORS OF HIGH BUILDING COSTS NON SEQUEL RELATED NEIGHBORHOOD OPPOSITION LACK OF AVAILABLE SITES. IN PARTICULAR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION ONE OF THE MAIN BARRIERS IS ALSO LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING. SO RESPECTIVELY RESPECTFULLY ARCHER NOVA ON THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE TEACHER MEMBERS NIKITA CRIED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WERE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WE ARE POSTED ONLINE -- COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE SIERRA CLUB THANK YOU CAN. BRIAN A WIKI CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MATTHEW BAKER PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAGUE. ERIN RYE BREAD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION ALSO DIDN'T MAKE THE ANALYSIS BUT WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY ARE SO THE ITEMS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION -- ANY. QUESTIONS REMEMBERS MISS MINIMIZED HER. MY QUESTION IS OF RIDGES JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- SINCE THERE IS A A QUESTION. ON ALL OF THESE ARE ATTEMPTS HERE. TO SPEED UP ALL THE SEA GLOW REVIEW OUR WITHOUT HIM HIM PAIRING I THINK THE ACTUAL REVIEW OF THE E. I. R. AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT PROVIDES. TO THE ENVIRONMENT OUR HOUSE ARE MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A SEQUEL COURT IF YOU WILL OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE. A TWO THREE OTHER BILLS HERE WITH THE SAME IDEA. AND WE HAVE A GOVERNOR ON VERY VERY CONCERNED WITH THE SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN. SO IF WE HAVE A CRISIS IN QUOTES. AND WE HAVE EMERGENCY IT WOULD BE MY THOUGHT THAT MAYBE JUDICIAL COUNCIL COULD CONSIDER THE WAY TO CREATE. OUR PROCESS IN A COURT IF YOU WILL THAT COULD REALLY DEAL WITH THESE SO THAT BOTH SIDES OF EVERY ARGUMENT HAVE. REALLY A VERY THOROUGH HEARING AND LO AND BEHOLD WE MIGHT FIND A RESOLUTION THE SEQUEL DOES THE JOB IS SUPPOSED TO DO BUT IN IT IS NOT ALWAYS BECOME THE BAD GUY THE BLACK CAT. IN CREATING ALL THESE PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOTH CAROLINIAN ON CITY COUNCIL. AND WE FOUND YOU KNOW ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF MANY OF THE DEVELOPERS TO BE VERY RELEVANT IN IN TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE SO YOU CAN SERVE BOTH SIDES OF THIS. RIGHT I THINK IS THE JUDICIAL OUR RESPONSIBILITY. SO I JUST ASK AND KIND OF THROW THAT OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OBVIOUSLY NOT TODAY. THAT -- THAT YOU TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA MAY BE MAKING THE SAME COMMENTS ON EVERY BILL THAT'S COMING BEFORE US. THESE AUTHORS OF WORK VERY HARD TO TRY TO NAVIGATE THROUGH AND INSURE THAT HE COULD DOES THE JOB THAT WAS INTENDED TO DO WHEN IT WAS PUT INTO PLACE MANY YEARS AGO. AND JUST BRIEFLY APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS -- THERE HAS BEEN -- PROPOSALS TO CREATE SPECIALITY SECRET -- THAT SENATOR CORBETT AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICKINSON. TRIED IN AROUND TWENTY TWELVE OR SO WE DID OPPOSE THIS WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF OPPOSING SPECIALLY COURT LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EFFICIENT WAY OF ADMINISTERING. OUR COURTS THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SEQUEL CASES -- YOU KNOW WE DON'T CONTROL WHAT CASES GET FILED IN WHICH COURTS AND HOW OFTEN -- ARE. OUR COURTS ARE NOT TELLING US THEY NEED MORE SICK BUT JUDGES ARE SPECIALTY COURTS TO HANDLE THE CASES. THE BIGGEST AREA OF DELAY IN SEQUEL ACCORDING TO MY EXPERTS IS FIGHTS OVER THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD AND THERE ARE SOME IDEAS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE'VE OFFERED TO TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS -- BUT THINK RECORDS ARE SPECIALLY COURTS ARE SPECIAL FUNDING FOR SICK WITH JUDGES IS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IS THE BEST WAY OF PROCEEDING IN HANDLING THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE. OKAY ARE IN MY I HEAR THIS A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE DISCUSSION THAT HAS -- THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR -- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT -- THE SPORTS STADIA THAT HAVE [inaudible] GOTTEN. EXPEDITED REVIEW -- DID RECEIVE EXPERT REVIEW BUT I I GUESS THE THE THE THING IS THAT IN ALL THOSE CASES INCLUDING THE NINE HUNDRED CASES -- THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE WERE TERMS THAT WERE INCLUDED THAT MADE THE PROJECTS ENVIRONMENTALLY SUPERIOR THE IDEA BEING THAT IF WE'RE GOING -- TO GRANT LENIENCY UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FROM A QUALITY ACT. ARE WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A A NEXT LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT AND I WILL SAY THAT'S AT LEAST. ARE A LARGE PART OF THE SPIRIT BEHIND THE PROPOSED DEMANDS. ON THE OTHER BILLS. I THAT ARE GONNA BE HEARD THIS MORNING. I AND I YOU KNOW AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE THE YOU KNOW THE LOGIC OF THE AUTHOR -- BUT YOU KNOW THERE THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE. I'M GOOD FRIENDS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A LOT OF INTEREST IN IN IN. YOU'RE TAKING AMENDMENTS TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL I THINK THE OTHERS TRYING. TO YOU KNOW GET THIS GET HIS IDEAS OUT THERE AND I I RESPECT THAT -- BUT IT DOES MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I WILL SAY THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF A RELEVANT APPLICABLE EXEMPTIONS ALREADY EXIST AND AND THEY'RE THEY'RE OUTLINED ON PAGES FIVE AND SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. INFILL PROJECTS CONSISTENT GENERAL PLAN CONSISTS OF A SPECIFIC PLAN MIXED USE PROJECTS AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THERE'S TRANSIT ORIENTED SO THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT ALREADY EXIST THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE HEARING THAT WE HAD -- WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON ON SEA QUEST. I AM I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE THE THE PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION -- WHAT WE KNOW WITH WITH EXCEPTION OF A FEW THAT WERE RAISED -- WELL WITH PARTICULAR THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS CONCERNS I THINK WE'RE PRIMARILY CONCERNS THAT RELATE -- TO THE PURVIEW OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND IF THIS BILL AND OTHER BILLS I GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE ALL OF THEM WILL GO OVER JUST A COMMITTEE WHERE. I THINK THEY'RE GONNA. QUITE FRANKLY MEET A GREAT DEAL OF SKEPTICISM -- BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATIONS TO OUR JUDICIARY AND THE IMPACT ON ON YOU KNOW ON ON THE ALL ALL THE VARIOUS KIND OF SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY -- THE THE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I'M SO THAT'S A SEPARATE SET OF ISSUES I I THINK OUR OUR ATTITUDE HERE HAS BEEN -- REALLY ABOUT IT -- YOU MOVED SAYING THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO GIVE SOME LENIENCY ON SEE WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO SEE NEXT LEVEL ENVIRONMENTALLY QUALITY I'M FINALLY SUPERIOR PROJECTS. AND DONE. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN THIS BILL TODAY BUT I I CERTAINLY THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE SENATOR -- YOU YOU WILL TAKE INTEREST IN THE OTHER BILLS THAT WILL BE HEARD THIS MORNING WHERE THE AUTHORS DID WORK VERY EXTENSIVELY WITH THE STAFF. AND THE COMMITTEE ON ON TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD MEET THOSE GOALS AND AND I KIND OF INVITE YOU TO ENGAGE WITH THOSE OFFICES AND TALK TO THEM. AND IF IF THIS BILL DOESN'T GET OUT TODAY -- SO. WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CAST A VOTE BUT BUT MINIMIZED HERE YEAH YEAH I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR. IN ALL THE AUTHORS THAT. LOOKING OUT THIS VERY VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WE HAVE THIS PARTICULAR BILL I FOUND TO BE. YOU KNOW SOMETHING I WOULD STRONGLY SUPPORT THE WAY IT FOCUSES IN ON FIFTY OR MORE OUR HOUSING UNITS SO. FAR WITHOUT A MOVE THAT TO YOU KNOW AND HOLDS OUT GOING FORWARD -- WE CAN HAVE ON CONTINUED DISCUSSION BECAUSE WOULD BE MY HOPE THIS YEAR WE GET SOMEWHERE ON THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING YOU KNOW AND THESE ARE ALL GREAT STARS AND I NEED TO SEE HIM JUST GO AWAY. SO WITHOUT I'LL MOVE. APPRECIATE THAT MINIMIZE YOUR WILL WILL WILL I TAKE UP THE BILL FOR A VOTE WHEN -- AND WHEN WHEN THE COMMITTEE HAS A QUORUM BUT THANK YOU AND AND STICK AROUND BECAUSE OF THE A LOT OF DISCUSSION. IF YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WHAT YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR -- A COUPLE THINGS THAT WAS MENTIONED -- BY THE THOSE IN OPPOSITION -- IS THERE'S BEEN MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR SEQUEL REFORM BUT NONE OF THEM'S WORK AT SECOND WHILE THE REASON I DIDN'T TAKE THE MEASUREMENTS AS IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THESE BILLS THAT COME FORWARD ARE VERY GOOD THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BILL MAHER EXPLAINS WHY IN A MINUTE. BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS OF WATERS IT DOWN AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN THAT'S WHY WERE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION HOUSING UNITS SHORT. AGAIN ONE OF THE LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC SLEEVE IN OUR STATE ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED YOUNG PROFESSIONALS THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY HOMES HERE. IN WAS INTERESTING SOME OF WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAID -- I I LOVE IT HERE IT IS THE GENTLEMAN RIGHT HERE SAID IT IT'S BAD FOR THE COURTS. WE'LL SEE I'M GOT ELECTED TO REPRESENT MY CONSTITUENTS SO I GIVE MORE PRIORITY TO THE CITIZENS OF OUR STATE FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS. PEOPLE NEED HOUSING MORE THAN I AM -- THE COURT SYSTEM OR THE BUREAUCRACY AND AND AND ANOTHER COMMENT WAS MADE THAT THAT SOMEHOW I THINK THIS BILL PREFERS -- DEVELOPERS YOU KNOW OVER YOU KNOW SICK WHAT. THAT THAT'S NOT ACCURATE EITHER I PREFER OUR CITIZENS TO GET IN HOMES BECAUSE AS OUR GOVERNOR SAYS IS THAT -- C. A. R. SALES OF THE BILLING INDUSTRY SAYS WE DO HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE WRITING -- SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR YOUR MEDIUM -- PRICE HOME IN CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN IT'S NOT THAT I PREFER DEVELOPERS I PREFER OUR CITIZENS TO BE ABLE TO GET IN HOMES I WANT TO KEEP THEM HERE KEEP THEM PRODUCTIVE. AND I THINK HOME OWNERSHIP IS A DREAM FOR PEOPLE AND THEN ANOTHER THING WHICH I THOUGHT WAS WAS IN SOME WAYS YOU SHOW HOW. SOME PEOPLE GET -- MIRED DOWN IN THE BUREAUCRACY IS -- THAT ONE OF THE GERMS BEGIN APPEAR TALKED ABOUT THIS HE MENTION OF MAYBE THREE OR FOUR TIMES A SUPER ACCELERATED TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY A PROCESS. THAT IS HORRIBLE I MEAN THAT IS SO SLOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATES AROUND US WHETHER IT'S UTAH IDAHO. TEXAS OR ARIZONA TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS I MEAN THESE TRACKS ARE BUILT GONE AND ARE SOLD OUT BY THEM SO EVEN OUT PROCESS IT'S NOT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT IT'S NOT SUPER ACCELERATED AT ALL IT'S JUST A MATTER BEING MIRED DOWN IN BUREAUCRACY. AND AND AS MY CLOSING STATEMENT THIS GET THIS BILL IS GOOD FOR CITIZENS IT'S GOOD FOR OUR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS IT'S GOOD TO MOVE PEOPLE UP BECAUSE WE WANT TO HELP ALL BOATS THE FLOAT WE WANNA -- WHEN WHEN YOU GET THE MIDDLE CLASS UPPER MIDDLE CLASS UPPER MIDDLE CLASS YOU WANT TO GET THE LOWER CLASS? RAISE THEM UP TO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND POOR PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF YOU KNOW -- SHELTERS AND THAT KIND OF THING AND ACTUALLY GET HIM IN THE HOMES AND THAT'S WHY WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS HELPS -- CONSTRUCTION FOR CALIFORNIA BE COMPETITIVE IN THE HOME BUYING MARK INSTEAD OF BEING THE THIRD WORST STATE. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MOVE UP THAT LADDER SO THAT'S THAT'S MY STORY AND I'M STICKING TO IT NINE RESHAPE MY MY FOLKS HERE TODAY A PRE APPRECIATE THOUGH I MEAN I WILL SAY YOUR OWN WITNESS DID SAY THAT. YOU KNOW. EVEN IF HE WAS NOT THAT. IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS AND WE CERTAINLY HAD A WHOLE HEARING ABOUT THIS -- BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE SOME CASES OUT THERE WHERE IT'S PROVED TO BE A CHALLENGE -- I DO I WILL SAVE MAYBE MAYBE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE FOR BOTH OF US TO JOIN HANDS AND IN ASKING -- FOR IT NO MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS OF FUNDING FOR THE COURTS. SO THAT THEY REALLY CAN -- YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS AND AND AND TO THE TUNE OF SEVEN DAYS. YEAH IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SUCH A THE REASON WE KNOCK THAT TONY SEVENTY DOWN YOU KNOW. BECAUSE IT IS YES SIR MY WITNESS MAKE A SMALL POINT ON AT HOME SO IT IS NOT GONNA DO GET ORGAN BRANCH. YOU KNOW IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. CAME UP TO IN THE STUDY THAT I ONCE TALKED ABOUT. IN THAT SURVEY LOT OF THE RESPONDENTS SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR LITIGATION OR LEAVE YOU KNOW STREAMLINING THINGS LIKE THAT SO. EVEN THOUGH THAT SURVEY YOU KNOW DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK THAT SIMPLIFICATION ITSELF. WAS THAT HUGE OF AN IMPEDIMENT I'M NOT GONNA YOU KNOW DIRECTLY. GO AGAINST THAT. THE RSPONSE TO THAT SURVEY YOU KNOW CITY PLANNING STAFF DID THINK THAT MORE STREAMLINING WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE ISSUE OF GETTING. MORE HOUSING PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD IN THE THER THING THAT ACTION NOW I REMEMBER. TO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA OF THE EP'S SURVEY AND ALSO THE UC BERKELEY UC BERKELEY -- PAPERS AS WELL. BUT THEY SHOWED IS THAT IT'S VERY HARD FOR LARGER PROJECTS LARGER HOUSING PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE FULL E. R. E. I. R.. TO GO FORWARD AND IT'S REALLY ONLY THE SMALLER SIZE PROJECTS OF YOU KNOW SIXTY TO A HUNDRED UNITS OR SO. THAT ARE GETTING OUT THERE GOING THROUGH THE EXISTING. EXEMPTIONS AND SO FORTH BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT DATA IT DOES SHOW THAT -- GETTING THOSE LARGER PROJECTS APPROVED IS DIFFICULT. YEAH I I I GET IT I I'M IN NJ THE YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THE RESPONSES OF IT WE SAID HEY DID NOT SEE SEE QUIT. AS AN IMPEDIMENT BUT I BUT I WILL SAY THAT DID YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA SEE A WILLINGNESS -- TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE OF EXPEDITING IN THE NEXT COUPLE BILLS AND AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO IMPOSE AT LEAST SOME DEGREE OF ENVIRONMENT MEDICATION MEASURES. HI YOU KNOW I THINK THERE WOULD BE MORE OPENNESS ON THE PART OF THE COMMITTEE TO WORK WITH YOU -- BUT THE IDEA THAT WERE LITERALLY GOING TO AND YOU KNOW TO TO TO MAKE THIS ENORMOUS CHANGE. TO TO THE WAY THE SEQUEL WORKS WITHOUT ANY KIND OF DISCERNIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. I THINK WAS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE VINYL QUALITY COMMITTEE. TO THE STOMACH BUT THAT BEING SAID I I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE NEXT FEW BILLS WHICH I WELCOME YOU TO GET ENGAGED WITH -- A WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF THIS COMMITTEE TO TO DEMONSTRATE SOME FLEXIBILITY AS LONG AS THERE'S A DISCERNIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ASSOCIATED SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION ONLINE AND AND IN IN IN GOOD QUALITY PROJECTS THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF SO.

I RECEIVED -- SEQUESTERING LYING -- OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS -- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW DURING THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS GOVERNOR NEWSOME. SAID QUOTE IN RECENT YEARS WITH EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEWS ON SEQUEL FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS IT'S TIME WE DO THE SAME THING -- FOR HOUSING. AN SP SIX TWENTY ONE DOES JUST THAT. AT THE CALIFORNIA VINYL QUALITY ACT IS THE HALLMARK OF CALIFORNIA'S DEDICATION TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR STATE'S BROADEST ENVIRONMENTAL RULE -- THIS BILL UP HOLDS ALL THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS [inaudible] AND REVIEWS. I DOES NOT LIMIT THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO OBJECT TO PROJECTS UNDER SEQUENCE NOR DOES IT GRANT ANY NEW EXEMPTION TO SEE WHAT. THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC INPUT DEVELOPING AN E. I. R. AND ABILITY TO CHANGE A PRIVATE CHALLENGER PROJECT ALL REMAIN INTACT. THIS BILL SIMPLY ESTABLISHES. A SET TIME PERIOD IN WHICH THE COURT OVERSEEING A SECRET CHALLENGE TO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT MUST BE COMPLETED. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT BUILD HOUSING AND IN RARE EXCEPTIONS. THAT WE RELY ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO INVEST THEIR OWN RESOURCES. THE PROCESS UNDER SB SIX TWENTY ONE CREATES MORE LEGAL PREDICTABILITY. AND CERTAINTY FOR BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE CERTAINLY THIS BUILD VANCE'S CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING GOALS -- IN THE ANALYSIS -- NUMBER OF ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED -- REGARDING. HEIGHTENING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS SHARE YOU RAISE THIS ISSUE AN EARLIER BILLS THIS MORNING. AND WE'RE VERY OPEN TO INCORPORATING THOSE -- STANDARDS -- IN -- IN PROVIDING FOR THE LET THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE YOUAS YOU KNOW IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF HOUSING ADVOCATES NONPROFITS AND BUSINESS GROUPS AND I'M JOINED BY MY JOINT AUTHOR. SENATOR CABALLERO AND PAT SABLE HOUSE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU AGREE TO THE MEMBER OF THE OFFICE. I MEAN OKAY. WHEN WE GO THROUGH THOSE TO BE PRETTY CLEAR -- ON WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I MEAN I GUESS WE WELL. AND WE WERE MOVING ON WITH THAT WE HAVE AGREED THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE TO DISCUSS POTENTIALLY ALLOWING SOME EXCUSE AND PROJECTS -- WE'VE. WE HAVE AGREED TO A FIVE YEAR SUNSET INSTEAD OF THREE AND THEN THEN WE TALKED ABOUT -- THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A FOR THE HOUSING PROJECTS UNDER THIS BILL WOULD INVOLVE LEGAL CERTIFIED WE DID. I'D SAY WE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO EXPLORE SUBSTANTIVE EQUIVALENT. TO THE LEGAL STANDARD -- BUT YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE VERY -- EMPHATIC ABOUT. ABOUT NOT. DEBATING FROM THAT STANDARD IF WE CAN FIND AN EQUIVALENT -- THE WE'RE WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT -- WE TALKED ABOUT IN FILL IN PROXIMITY TRANSISTOR OP PROJECTS SITE LESS THAN FIVE ACRES MAX TWO HUNDRED RESIDENTIAL UNITS. FOR MINIMUM THIRTY YEARS. I THINK THOSE WERE THE YEAH SO AS YOU'VE EXPLAINED IT. I CAN SUMMARIZE IT IN MY WORDS BUT I THINK IT WE ARE IN THE SAME PAGE THERE. THE AMENDMENT -- SORRY SORRY. TO TO INTERRUPT THE FLOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- REALLY ONE AT THANK YOU FOR THAT. TIME AND ENERGY THAT YOU PUT INTO LOOKING AT THESE BILLS BECAUSE I THINK WERE WERE MOVING IN AND REALLY GOOD DIRECTION AND I'M I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY AS CO AUTHOR -- BEST BE SIX TWENTY ONE WHICH AS YU. HEARD STREAM LIES IT STREAMLINES JUDICIAL REVIEW TO INCENTIVIZE THE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND THAT -- ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT. THE WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR SPORTS ARENA MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE LAST DECADE IS ALSO APPLIED TO THE WHAT WE WOULD. DEEM AT AFFORDABILITY CRISIS ON THE LACK OF HOUSING HAS FORCED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS INTO HOMELESSNESS -- AND SO OUR GOAL HERE IS TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE ABLE -- TO ENERGIZE THE MARKET HAVE SOME CERTAINTY -- AND BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THE ANY CONFLICTS THAT MAY OCCUR NOT TO GET RID OF SEQUIN NOT TO REDUCE ANY OF ITS PROTECTIONS BUT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THROUGH -- ALLEGED AT AM MINISTRY TO PROCESS REVIEWING -- LITIGATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PATRICK SABLE HOUSE I AM -- THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- WHICH CONSISTS OF THE OF THE LENDERS AND THE DEVELOPERS OF THE BUILDERS -- THAT ARE INVOLVED IN -- THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS. FOR SOME THIRTY YEARS NOW AND WERE -- EXTREMELY PLEASED TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF OF THIS BILL -- WE THINK THE IT IS GIVEN HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE -- WITH REGARD TO THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR. BOND ISSUE THAT THE IS GOING TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE ADDITIONAL MONIES THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET -- IN THAT -- ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE IN AND THE ASSEMBLY HAS PROPOSED THAT THE INCREASE OF SOME FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. OF THAT WOULD BE USED -- IN PARK FOR FOR FOR MIDDLE INCOME AND AND LOW INCOME HOUSING. AND IN THE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND ADDITIONAL STATE TAX CREDITS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING AND THEN HIS -- HIS MOST CHALLENGING -- EFFORT TO TO PRODUCE -- NOT NOT THE A MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS IN THE NEXT -- FIVE YEARS BUT TO TO TO HE'S PROPOSING. A THREE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- GIVEN GIVEN ALL THOSE STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. OF THAT WE NEED TO TAKE THE EVERY EVERY ACTION THAT WE CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE AND INCENTIVIZE AND KNOCKED. THE BARRIERS THAT -- THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF OF OF ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- EVEN THAT THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM TODAY AS YOU WILL RECALL IT ONLY PRODUCES ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS OF OF TRULY AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- IN AND WITH THE INCREASED BUDGETS -- YOU'LL YOU'LL HAVE A LOT MORE TAX EXEMPT BOND DEVELOPMENTS GOING FORWARD -- THAT WILL -- MEET THIS -- THIS CHALLENGE THAT'S THE SET FORTH HERE TODAY WERE YOU WOULD HAVE A PROJECT HOPEFULLY OF THE TWO HUNDRED UNITS -- A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED UNITS THAT WOULD INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF SIGNIFICANTLY OVER WHAT WE HAVE NOW BUT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT -- THAT WE WE FIND EVERY WAY TO KNOCK DOWN BARRIERS THAT WILL STOP THAT MONEY OF FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND THE TAX CREDIT COMMITTEE IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE FROM GETTING OUT THE DOOR -- TO HAVE THE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE BUT NOT BE ABLE TO TO TO CHARGE FORWARD AND UTILIZE THOSE RESOURCES -- TO TO DAMPEN THE THE THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH HOMELESSNESS -- IS IS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND AND WE NEED TO CHARGE ON SO. WE WE SUPPORT THIS BILL WHOLEHEARTEDLY -- AND THANK GOD -- CENTER CUBBY EURO AND AND AND SENATOR GLAZER UP FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. OKAY OUR FOLKS WANT TO WIN SUPPORT. DOESN'T MATTER NOT LIKE HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. KELLY GOVERNOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND SUPPORT RICHARD. OR IN SEDONA FROM HABITAT FOR HUMANITY GREATER SAN FRANCISCO AND SUPPORT. CASSIE GILSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. HE'S DONE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. JOHN KENNEDY WITH RURAL COUNTIES AGAIN AND SUPPORT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS OF SEQUEL FOR DISCLOSURE FOR MITIGATION. SO THIS IS SIMPLY EXPEDITING THE PROCESS STRUNG WITH SUPPORT THAT -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THE AMENDMENT AS THE BILL GOES FORWARD TO MITIGATE COST IMPACTS THAT MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING LESS AFFORDABLE RIGHT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CAROLING ON HALF OF THE BURNING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION THEY'RE UNAFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER IN TE CINNAMON APPLE AREA AND THEY'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS MISSION LOOK FOR TO SEE THAT BEFORE THANK YOU. OKAY OUR FOLKS WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS OUR OPPOSITION I'M. OKAY SO. ARE YOU GONNA DO IS YOUR ARGUMENT IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT IT WAS. BEFORE. OKAY -- MEMBERS TEMPLE FOR THE USUAL COUNCIL -- ALL THE COMMENTS I MADE ON THE LAST BILL WOULD APPLY HERE JUST A COUPLE OF VERY QUICK POINTS. I'M THE AUTHOR SAID -- THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- IS A IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THIS BILL IS THE LEGAL PREDICTABILITY AND CERTAINTY. THAT WOULD COME WITH THIS APPROACH AND AS I INDICATED BEFORE AND I WANT TO STRESS. IN THE LITIGATION THAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY UNDER THE STREAMLINING PROVISIONS. THAT CERTAINTY IS NOT THERE SUBSCRIBE TO IT ANY PROJECT THAT'S HIGHLY CONTESTED THERE WILL BE BOTH THE QUIT AND NON SEQUEL CAUSES OF ACTION AND LAWSUITS FILED. IT WILL NOT PROVIDE THE CERTAINTY THAT THEY ARE SEEKING WE DO APPRECIATE THE ALL THE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AT THE VERY END OF THE BILL -- THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TENAX SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE COURTS FOR HANDLING SEE WHAT CASES BUT AS I POINTEDOUT. THAT'S REALLY NOT OUR GOAL AND WE WE WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT -- BUT I THINK GOING OUT IN FUNDING AND PUTTING CONSTRAINTS ON THE FUNDING FOR PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF CASES IS A REALLY INEFFICIENT WAY OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL. ISSUES WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER STREAMLINING MECHANISMS THAT COULD BE DONE THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON BUT RESPECTFULLY THIS LIKE WHAT WHAT KIND OF THINGS. LIKE WHAT KIND OF THINGS WE THINK WOULD WORK. ONE OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A BIT. UNDER CURRENT LAW OF THE AS I MENTIONED THE PREPARATION THERE AND FIGHTS ABOUT THE RECORD OF PROBABLY THE BIGGEST AREA OF FRIDAY AND SEE. ONE CONCEPT THAT'S BEEN FLOATED THERE'S NOT A COUNCIL SPONSORED PROPOSAL BY ANY MEANS BECAUSE IT'S DEALING WITH SICK WITH SUBSTANTIVELY. BUT OUR EXPERTS BIRDS OF IDENTIFIED THAT THAT UNDER SEAQUEST OPPOSED TO MOST. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY KIND OF PROCESS AND YOU HAVE BOTH THE PUBLIC AGENCY AND THE PETITIONER. BEING ALLOWED TO PREPARE. THE RECORD -- WE SEE A LOT OF DELAY COMING WITH THE PETITIONER PREPARATION THE RECORD ISSUES IF IT WAS JUST THE PUBLIC AGENCY NOT CONSULTED WITH THE NUMBER OF SICK WITH EXPERT ATTORNEYS INCLUDING. ATTORNEYS THAT REPRESENTED THE WARRIORS AND OTHER LITIGATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION AND THEY DO AGREE THAT THE BIGGEST AREA OF DELAY. HAS TO DO WITH FIGHTS OVER THE RECORD MOTION TO A LARGE AND CERTIFY THE RECORD IT CETERA. AND SOONE THING THAT WE THINK RESPECTFULLY SHOULD BE EXPLORED. IS THIS ISSUE OF WHETHER WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW PETITIONERS OF THE ABLE TO PREPARE AND CERTIFY THE RECORD IN THESE CASES AS OPPOSED TO THE PUBLIC AGENCY WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY KIND OF DECISION THAT COULD BE APPEALED TO COURT VIA A RED THE ISSUE THERE IS A PUBLIC AGENCY DOESN'T WANT TAKE ON THAT BURDEN IS THAT. THERE MAY BE THERE MAY BE COST ISSUES THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS PART OF THAT AGAIN IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT A COUNCIL SPONSOR PROPOSAL BUT WE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED REPEATEDLY OVER THE YEARS TO COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS THAT COULD TRULY STREAMLINE AS OPPOSED TO THIS APPROACH. AND THAT'S ONE AREA THAT'S CERTAINLY WORTH EXPLORING OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHELSEA TO WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO OPPOSE SB SIXTY SIX TWENTY ONE FOR SIMILAR REASONS I STATED EARLIER. A NORMAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES CARE DEEPLY ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NOT ONLY. FACE. THE HOUSING PRICES IN THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LIVE THE HOUSING PRICES EVERY DAY -- HOWEVER AGAIN I JUST WANT TO STRESS THAT SEEK WAS NOT THE PROBLEM TO HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION. SOLUTIONS AND CUNNING SYKORA WILL NOT COME ONE SHOULD NOT COME FROM THIRTY SOLUTIONS NOT COME FROM FURTHER WEAKENING THIS IMPORTANT LAW. AND IN ESSENCE SB SIX TWENTY ONE OTHER BILLS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER TRIES TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT DOES NOT EXIST. AND I WOULD RECOMMEND. IN THE COMMUNITY AND OTHER COMMUNITIES LOOKING INTO. SOLUTIONS THAT WILL ACTUALLY PROTECT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AN ALARM TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. OF FOR EXAMPLE BY DEEPENING OF THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES -- AND ESPECIALLY PRIORITIZING HOUSING THAT'S AFFORDABLE TO EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS REQUIRING URGING STRONGER TENANT PROTECTIONS SUCH AS ELIMINATING RESTRICTIONS ON LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAWS GUARANTEEING RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN HOUSING COURT -- ESTABLISHING STRONGER ANTI DISPLACEMENT LOCAL HIGH REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT. CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOUSING ELEMENT NOW ON THIS BILL AND LOOK FOR TRUE HOUSING SOLUTIONS THAT WILL SUPPORT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR YOUR I WILL SAY THAT ON THIS BILL AND THE NEXT. ONE BOTH REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT. AND AND AND GIVEN THE ABOVE MARKET -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS. AND I AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN ENGAGING IN DISCUSSION ABOUT DISPLACEMENT. ANTI DISPLACEMENT LANGUAGE BETWEEN CONNECTS OF THE OF OF ITEM NUMBER ONE IN THE U. S. B. TWENTY FIVE BUT BUT I THINK WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO THIS DISPLACEMENT ISSUE. AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE -- BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. SO -- THAT'S ALL PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS WELL BUT YES SORRY YES SIR. HELLO TRODDEN ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA LEAVE CONSERVATION VOTERS -- IN OPPOSITION. FRIEND ALSO SIERRA CLUB -- I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE A POINT ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT I DISCUSSED EARLIER -- THIS IS TYPICALLY THE ONLY REMEDY THAT MANY SIX LETTERS PURSUE -- AND LIMITING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WITH OBVIOUSLY LIMIT WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH THEIR CASE AND SO. WITH THAT WE RESPECT WE WILL OPPOSE. ERIN RUBBER GONNA BE HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. BRIAN THE WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN OPPOSITION. MATTHEW BIGGER PLAYING CONSERVATION THAT WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE GO BUT WE SHARE THE CONCERNS -- EXPRESS YOUR BY THE OPPOSITION WE APPRECIATE THE THE RECOMMEND. STATIONS OF THE THE COMMITTEE FOR AMENDMENTS WE THINK THOSE WOULD BE IMPROVEMENTS INDEED BUT STILL YOU KNOW ARE UNCERTAIN THAT WOULD REALLY GO FAR ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THE PROPOSAL. OKAY ANOTHER THING TO CLARIFY FOR MY FRIEND FROM THE SIERRA CLUB WE REMOVE THE PROVISIONS THAT LIMIT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF -- SO THAT'S AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SELF. THAT ISSUE -- ELISE'S BEEN ADDRESSED AS WELL I KNOW SALUDABLE WORK IN PROGRESS IT'S ALWAYS MOVING AROUND BUT BROUGHT TRYING HEREOKAY I ARE YOU A TWEENER. WHAT DO YOU HEAR? YOUR OPPOSITION OKAY ARE YOU JUST HANGING BACK OKAY. OKAY FIFTY NG WITH THE CALIFORNIA BY RELIGIOUS ALLIANCE TO HAVE. ONLY ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BEFORE BY CRP AND OTHER GROUPS THAT. ON THIS BILL IS REALLY NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE A LEVEL FOUR WHEEL HOUSING THAT WE REALLY NEED. ESPECIALLY FOR MANY LOW INCOME COMMUNICATIVE COLOR THAT ARE AFRAID THAT THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION IS GOING TO PUSH THEM OTHER HOMES. REALLY HOPE NOT WE CAN SEEK WERE. SHE HAD THE AUTHOR'S INTENSE WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION AND SO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY THIS IS A NOW BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION. IF YOU. SURE THE TERM SHEET WITH. CINEMA CASKEY. OKAY GREAT -- QUESTIONS DISCUSSION FIGHTS CONCERNS ISSUES WE STILL HAVE A QUORUM SO WE STILL CAN'T CAST A VOTE OBVIOUSLY BUT HI DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE DISCUSSION IT'S HAPPENED SO FAR WITH THE OPPOSITION. CENTERED. WELL I WOULD JUST SAY ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ISSUE -- CERTAINLY 'M SENSITIVE TO THAT THAT CONCERN AND AS HE INDICATED THAT I'VE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT IT [inaudible] THAT -- INDICATES THAT I'D LIKE TO SUPPORT ANY KIND OF HIGHER COSTS THIS WITH HIM AND AND IN KERR ON THE COURTS -- BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT SOME OF THE CRITICS SAY THAT -- THIS IS IN PART OF THE PROBLEM AT ALL INSIGHTS TO SUCCEED SHOW A FRACTION OF CASES THAT ARE EVER FILED ON SEA QUEST. SO IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S ARGUMENTS THAT. HAPPENED -- OPPOSITION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE OF THE ISSUE THEY THERE AREN'T VERY MANY AND THEN THEY COST A LOT AND THEY CLOG THE COURTS SO BUT I'M HAPPY TO WORKING THROUGH TO WORKING THROUGH THOSE -- THOSE ISSUES. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- THE CHAIR IS CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED THAT THIS BILL NOW IN ITS AMENDED FORM -- HAS HIGHER STANDARDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HIGHER STANDARDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL -- QUALITY -- AND AT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE END IF WE'VE IDENTIFIED THIS IS A CRISIS IN OUR STATE. THAT HOUSING IS A CRISIS ARE THERE WHILE THE CRITICS MIGHT SAY THIS DOESN'T DO ENOUGH. IT'S ALL ABOUT DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN AT EVERY LEVEL TO BE HELPFUL. YEAH I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS ARE YOU FOUND A PLACE SIDE TO MOVE. ON THE IDEA OF YOU KNOW CREATING MORE HOUSING FOR WORD ENDING AND SO IT'S A GOOD DEAL AND I LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AS YOU TAKE THE MMS IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE WORK AND THANK YOU TO STAFF. WERE OUT WORKING WITH YOU ON THE ISSUES THAT STILL REMAIN MAKOVSKY. JUST SO I'M CLEAR ON WHAT THE TERM SHEETS TO THE DEAL LIKE I GET THE GOLD CERTIFIED TRYING TO MAKE IT LIKE A B.. NINE HUNDRED THAT'S THAT'S FINE. WITH REGARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS AND POTENTIAL -- ALLOWING SOME MIXED USE PROJECT -- PROJECTS. CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT FOR ME I'M SORRY I GOT HERE LATE. WELL THE ISSUE THAT THEY CAME UP IN OUR DISCUSSION IS -- YOU KNOW. WE AT THE THOUGHT HERE IS THAT WE'VE GOT A GOVERNOR WHO'S MADE A VERY BOLD -- STATEMENT ABOUT WANTING TO REALLY ADDRESS THE HOUSING ISSUES THAT ARE AT PLAY AND AND YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS AS WE ALL DISCUSSES NORMALCY BECAUSE YOU KNOW MAYBE. THIS BABY SECRET BEING BY FAR TOO MUCH HERE IN THIS DISCUSSION BUT AT THE AT THE SAME TIME -- WE WE WE REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE THIS IS FOCUSED ON ON ON HOUSING. I HAVE A WE ALSO ARE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT HOUSING PROJECTS AND YOU KNOW. PENCIL OUT MUCH. MUCH BETTER IF THERE'S A CERTAIN DEGREE MIXED USE AND IN FACT. IF IF IT'S PROPERLY PLANNED YOU CAN HAVE A YOU KNOW A MORE SUSTAINABLE. SET UP -- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF PEOPLE ON A WALK TO WORK AND GET BUY THEIR GROCERIES ETCETERA -- RIGHT THERE NEXT TO IT NEXT TO WHERE THEY LIVE AND WE WANT TO I THINK WE SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A LOT MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY HOUSING PROJECTS OUT THERE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ALLOW FOR A CERTAIN DEGREE MIXED USE WILL HELP TO FINANCE THAT WERE OPEN TO THAT DISCUSSION RIGHT SO THE PROPHET THERE'S A PROHIBITION NOW ON MAKES USE. BUT THE IDEA IS THAT WE MAY ALLOW SOME EXCUSE WHATEVER THAT VOLUME IS THAT [inaudible] FAIR. WITH REGARD TO THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS JUDICIAL REVIEW. HI I'VE HEARD ALL THE ANALOGY IS ABOUT THE NEW BILLIONAIRE -- STADIUM PROJECTS BUT THAT'S ONE PROJECT. THIS ONE PROJECT AND IT'S A JUDICIAL REVIEW THERE'S ONE IN LA TWO SETS TO PROJECT BUT THEY'RE SIMPLE REVIEW. WHEN I READ THE LANGUAGE HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YES IF THERE'S SOMEBODY CHALLENGES THE E. I. R. THEY GET EXPEDITED? REVIEW THAT'S ONE ISSUE BUT IT'S FOR ANY OR GRANTING THE APPROVAL OF THE HOUSING PROJECT. SO THAT'S A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT -- SITUATION BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO CITIES ALL THAT MAY HAVE A I DID OBJECTION TO THE PROJECT. AND JUST BECAUSE IT'S A HOUSING PROJECT. THEN IT GETS THE THE MAGIC -- TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. THIS IS THE AM I READING THE LANGUAGE RIGHT IS THAT WHAT THE INTENT IS HERE THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYBODY THAT SAYSTHIS IS A HOUSING PROJECT WE GET. WE GET TO THE TOP LINE REGARDLESS WHETHER THE OTHER PRIORITIES ARE IN THE COURTS THE TERMS THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE BILL IN THE AMENDMENT. YES. OKAY. UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME. THAT'S THAT'S NOT THAT'S I GET THE ENTHUSIASM THAT PEOPLE HAVE OVER IT AND I GET THE AND I WILL. WE'LL DEAL WITH THE ANALOGIES BETWEEN A SPORTS A BILLION OR SPORTS CENTER IT'S VERY NICE VERY GREAT ON TWITTER AND ALL THAT TYPE OF STUFF BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE FOR THE COURTS TO SAY. EVERY PROJECT IF WE JUST UP WHAT WHAT THIS COURT SYSTEMS ARE MADE THAT WAY FORGET. FORGET TO SEEK WORK IN ON OTHER WITH RESPECT TO SENATOR -- THAT IT WAS A STUDY DONE LAST YEAR YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT -- POINTED OUT HOW FEW CHALLENGES. SO -- AND I I WOULD NOTE THAT WHILE THAT THE A STREAMLINED -- BILLS HAVE BEEN LIMITED WE JUST DID ONE LAST YEAR FOR OUR LEGISLATIVE PARKING STRUCTURES SO [inaudible] WORTH NOTING [inaudible] OKAY I'M. ONE OF ONE THING I WANTED I WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS ONE AND I MENTIONED TO THE JUDGE OF RELIEF I'VE JUST TO BE REALLY FAIR -- IT WAS IN THE HOUSES I DON'T KNOW THAT I DID GET YOUR EXPLICIT -- AGREEMENT TO THAT I'M. I WILL I WILL SAY THAT BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO JUDICIARY WHERE THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF QUESTION WILL BE -- HUGE I'M WILLING -- TO KEEP YOUR COMMITMENT TO THAT ISSUE BIG AT THIS POINT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY SERIOUSLY ADDRESSED OVER JUDICIARY SO OUR COMMITTEE IS ASKING FOR IT. I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD YOU TO IT FROM CANADA RIGHT NOW BUT I UNDERSTAND BUT I'M. CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL BE ASKED TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT -- IT JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- SO JUST TO CLARIFY -- THE ISSUE STILL PENDING JUST TO BE FAIR AND I ON THIS BILL ON ON THIS BILL MAY BE DIFFERENT OKAY -- THE OTHER I DID WANT TO ASK YOU THOUGH I DID WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT THE ISSUE WAS RAISED BY OUR OUR FRIEND FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHICH IS THIS ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT. ARE YOU KNOW -- ON A COMPLEX LITIGATION [inaudible] AND THE COMPLEX LITIGATION OF THE ONES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MULTIPLE CAUSES OF ACTION THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SEQUEL RELATED CAUSE OF ACTION YOU KNOW NONSTICK CAUSES OF ACTION -- THOSE NON SINGLE CAUSE OF ACTION ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO TWENTY SEVEN DAY RULE UNDER YOUR BELT. I'M SO THE IDEA WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS ARGUMENT WHICH I FIND. FRANKLY AND IN A COMPELLING RIGHT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THIS ARGUMENT THAT. ANY ANY LITIGATION MANY COMPLEX LITIGATION WORTH ITS SALT SALT WILL HAVE -- MULTIPLE CAUSES THE GATE AT CLEANING ON ON SEA QUEST AND THIS WILL SPEED UP THE pPROCESS AT ALL. WELL I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE REQUESTED -- LIMIT THAT OPTION BECAUSE YOU'VE INDICATED. THAT YOU'D LIKE US TO BE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN TWELVE TWO HUNDRED RESIDENTIAL UNITS. NOEL I LARGER THAN FIVE ACRES SO THERE'S LIMITS THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN THIS LEGISLATION THAT I THINK. MAKES THE LIKELIHOOD OF COMPLEX LITIGATION MUCH MUCH LESS. AND THAT THAT OF COURSE ALWAYS REMAINS A POSSIBILITY ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GIVE SOME -- GREATER CONFIDENCE TO THE PRIVATE. INVESTOR COMMUNITY THAT SAYS DO I WANT TO GET IN THERE. AND AND BUILD HOUSING PROJECTS PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON AFFORDABLE IS IT WORTH OF MY CAPITAL IS THE RISK WORTH IT. TO DO AND SO. YOU'VE CREATED SOME BRACKETS WITHIN THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS LEGISLATION. THAT DO LIMIT THE EXPOSURE AT SOME LEVEL AT BUT IT'S ALWAYS THERE AND THAT'S THAT GONNA BE THAT QUESTION AT THE END OF THE DAY. WITH THIS TO BECOME LAW IS WHETHER OR NOT THE THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR FEELS LIKE THE RISKS HAVE READ REDUCED ENOUGH TO HELP. FUEL THAT HOUSING -- BOOM THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS THOUGHTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE AND AND WE'LL GO ON TO THE CARRIER IS FALSE ON BEHALF OF CENTER CAP ERA MYSELF THANK YOU FOR THAT WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU AND AND YOU KNOW WE WERE IN A LONG AND AND ARDUOUS JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING YESTERDAY AND AND YOU KNOW PART PART OF THE HI. YEAH I I THESE ARE ALL VERY MUCH WORKS IN PROGRESS AND WE'RE WE'RE ALL CONVICTS YOU'LL BE AWARE THE NEXT TO ME WHERE THESE BILLS ARE HAD IT SO -- WITH THAT THANK YOU SENATOR AND WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE THE OTHER JOINTLY AUTHORED BILL -- THIS IS AS WE TWENTY FIVE ITEM ONE IN YOUR AGENDAS MEMBERS. SET A CAREER WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND SENATORS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. TWENTY FIVE WHICH IMPLEMENTS AN IMPORTANT STREAMLINING TO SEE QUALIFICATION BY PROVIDING CERTAINTY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS FUNDED BY QUALIFIED OPPORTUNITY ZONE FINES OR OTHER SPECIFIED PUBLIC FUNDS. AS YOU WELL KNOW CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS THAN THE COST OF RENTING A HOME IN CALIFORNIA IS AN ALL TIME HIGH. IN MY COMMUNITY IT'S TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT -- WHICH USUALLY HOUSES MANY MANY ADULTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT. ON IT HOME OWNERSHIP IS ALSO AT ITS LOWEST RATE SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE BENEFIT OF THE GI BILL HAS BEEN TOTALLY. ELIMINATED BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH THE WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING FOR TO MEET OUR WORKFORCE NEEDS. THIS OBVIOUSLY IS DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS INCREASED COST OF LAND MATERIALS ZONING RESTRICTIONS AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF LITIGATION BROUGHT SOMETIMES. AUSPICIOUSLY UNDERSEA QUOTE. WELL I VALUE AND SUPPORT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS OF SEA QUEST AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BECAUSE I THINK SEQUENCE SERVES A REALLY IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN OUR STATE. AND IT T REALLY GIVES COMMUNITIES AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE PROJECT CAN YOU DECIDE HOW TO MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS. IT'S BEEN OFTEN USED BY NIMBIS TO SLOW STALL FRUSTRATE AND OFTEN KILL PROJECTS FOR REASONS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH INSUFFICIENT ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT IN MY REGION I PROBABLY READ EVERY E. I. ARE -- IN THAT IN THIS IN SALINAS OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS -- INCLUDING MOST OF THE COUNTY COUNTY. AT E. IRISES WELL -- IT THAT DAY SYKORA THREAD OF SEQUEL -- LITIGATION OR LITIGATION HAS BEEN -- THREATENED ON ALMOST EVERY SINGLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT -- IN MY REGION AND THAT HAS DRASTICALLY INCREASED THE COST OFHOUSING -- FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS UNFORTUNATELY THE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS PREVAILING DELAYING OR HALTING MANY HOUSING PROJECTS INCLUDING. ONE OF THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITIES PROJECT IN REDWOOD CITY THE BAY AREA'S HEAVILY HOUSING IMPACTS ON ON THE PENINSULA. I'M COMMITTED TO INCREASING THE HOUSE OF HOUSING SUPPLY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IN TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO BRING AFFORDABILITY TO THE HOUSING MARKET. AND I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO TACKLING DECADES OF INSUFFERABLE POVERTY FOR THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE BLIGHTED COMMUNITIES IDENTIFIED BY THE GOVERNOR BROWN ADMINISTRATION. AS OUR CALIFORNIA'S POOREST JOB POOR COMMUNITIES ARE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. PRIVATE PRIVATE INVESTORS WILL BE POURING BILLIONS OF CAPITAL ESTIMATED TO BE UP TO SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS INTO THE NATION'S POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES ON FUNDS. CALIFORNIA IS COMPETING WITH EVERY OTHER STATE FOR THESE FUNDS AND NEEDS TO GIVE OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES EVERY TOOL TO GAIN A COMPETITIVE. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE S. B. TWENTY FIVE DOES NOT COST THE STATE ANY DIRECT FUNDS BUT IT WILL HELP OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO PACKAGE THEIR OWN OPPORTUNITIES ON PROJECTS. INTO ATTRACTIVE COMMUNITY TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENTS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK TO HELP SHAPE IS B. TWENTY FIVE AND EAT AND EVEN STRONGER FRAMEWORK. FIRST SEQUEL LITIGATION REFORM THE THOUGHTFUL COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RAISES MANY PAUL MANY POINTS IN THERE THERE'S TOO MANY TO KIND OF GO THROUGH THIS -- TODAY BUT I'M ABLE TO DISCUSS A FEW OF THOSE CONCERNS WITH THE CHAIR I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO TO MANY. I WISH WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THEM AND TALK ABOUT IT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT EFFORT THROUGH AND I ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- AND COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THE DETAILS OF SOME OF THOSE AS THE BILL PROCEEDED TO GETS OUT OF EQ TODAY -- IN PARTICULAR AND THE THAT THE NUMBERS AND THEY NEED TO WORK IN THE REAL WORLD AND I WANT TO BE ABLE -- TO TO TALK WITH THE THAT -- BUILDING COMMUNICABLE HOUSING PERCENT GM YEAH THE PRESENTING THE PERCENTAGE IN THE AM I AND AND THE REASON. IS I I'M YES IS IS AND I YOU KNOW HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND SOME TIME. OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH -- DEVELOPERS THAT ARE BUILT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IT THIS REALLY GETS TO THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE IS THAT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY LOOK OVER A FIVE OR A TEN YEAR HORIZON. THEY THEY HAVE TO BUY THE PROPERTY TODAY TO TO BE ABLE TO BUILD. X. NUMBER OF YEARS DOWN THE ROAD SO IF THEY'RE BUILDING TODAY THEY BOUGHT THE PROPERTY QUITE A BIT AGO AND WHAT THEY LOOK AT IS WHAT IS THE RISK IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ARE -- AND AT PUTTING TOGETHER THE MONEY TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS -- CAN I DO IT EASIER AND MAKE A BETTER RATE OF RETURN SOMEWHERE ELSE OR IS THE BURDEN INTO OF DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA SO MUCH THAT I CAN I'M GONNA KEEP A LIMITED SUPPLY. OF LAND AND INVESTMENT MONEY IN CALIFORNIA AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS. REALLY IT'S A BIGGER PICTURE WHICH IS ASCERTAIN WHAT THE RISK IS OF INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA AND AND PART OF THE PART OF THIS IS TO REDUCE THAT RISK. SO THAT THEY SEE A WAITING TO BE ABLE -- TO MOVE PROJECTS EXPEDITIOUSLY AND NOT BE HELD UP FOR YEARS -- BECAUSE OF LITIGATION THAT -- THEY HAVE NO CONTROL CONTROL OVER AND THAT ULTIMATELY MAY END UP BEING RESOLVED BUT BUT IN THE MEANTIME THEY'RE NOT BUILDING SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT -- THAT YOUR STAFF AND YOU HAVE DONE BECAUSE WITHOUT IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY MAKE IT MOVE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE HERE TODAY. WITH ME IS -- MARINE SIT DOWN AND FROM THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY GREATER SAN FRANCISCO AND HOT HOLLY FROM MANY IT HAS TO SUPPLY SOME LIGHT HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND MY CO CHAIR WITH ME TODAY MY CO. AUTHOR HERO PILOT CO PILOT. AND I'LL BE BRIEF BECAUSE THE CENTER HAVE A ROSE AND A GREAT JOB OF LAYING OUT THE REASONS FOR THIS EXCEPTIONAL BILL THAT -- GOVERNOR NEWSOME SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT FEDERAL OPPORTUNITIES OWN PROGRAMS ARE POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE. FOR OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES AND THIS BILL DOES CREATE NEW STREAMLINED SEQUEL LITIGATION FRAMER SO INVESTORS INVESTORS IN OPPORTUNITIES ON'S WILL KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA PROJECTS HURTING ARE GONNA GET A STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE UNNECESSARILY DELAY. SO WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE THE A NEW WAVE OF DEVELOPMENT -- THAT WOULD COME THROUGH OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND I'M PLEASED TO JOIN -- IN SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN NOT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S MARIN SAID ON AND I'M THE CEO OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY GREATER SAN FRANCISCO I'M ALSO THE VICE CHAIR OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF FORTY ONE AFFILIATES. ACROSS THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF OUR STATE. HABITAT PROVIDES A UNIQUE AND AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR FAMILIES. AS A HOME A HOME AT ZERO DOWN PAYMENT 0% INTEREST AND A THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGE WHICH MONTHLY PAYMENT SAT AT NO MORE THAN 30% OF OUR HOUSEHOLD INCOME. IN OUR PARTICULAR HABITAT OVER LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IN LIEU OF A DOWN PAYMENT FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS. PUT AS FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF SWEAT EQUITY TO BUILD THEIR FUTURE HOMES AND HOME OF THEIR NEIGHBORS WITH NO INTEREST ON THEIR MORTGAGE FAMILY START SAVING AS HOMEOWNERS. FROM DAY ONE IN THEIR HABITAT HOMES. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE THIS MORNING ALONGSIDE SENATOR CAFIERO AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND FOR SICK WITH SENATOR GLAZER AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT SB TWENTY FIVE IN ITS ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE APPLICATION OF THE CALIFORNIA VITAMIN A QUALITY ACT SIMPLER AND FAIRER. I'M ALSO HERE TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON THIS DILEMMA. HABITAT KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT SECRET IS TO MAINTAIN AND PROTECT OUR STATES AND REBEL AND BEAUTIFUL NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF THE APPLICATION ON THE GROUND HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE ABILITY OF DEVELOPERS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR WORKING FAMILIES. FOR NEARLY SIXTEEN MONTHS HABITAT. THE HABITAT DEVELOPMENT AND I THINK YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF IT IN FRONT OF YOU IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL -- ON JEFFERSON AVENUE IN DOWNTOWN REDWOOD CITY STUDENT WOULD NEEDLESSLY STALLED AS WE FOUGHT A BASELESS. LAWSUIT FROM OUR NEIGHBORS. THIS WAS FILED BY LOCAL BUSINESS WHO HAD A TRACK RECORD OF INITIATING SEQUEL LITIGATION. TWENTY LOCAL FAMILIES WITH HOUSEHOLD INCOMES BETWEEN FORTY AND 80% OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME. SHOULD BE GETTING READY TO MOVE INTO THESE HOMES TODAY. BUT INSTEAD THIS PROJECT WAS DELAYED IN AN EFFORT TO RAISE THE COST TO THE POINT. WHERE THE PROJECT WOULD STOP? WELL I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE'RE NEARLY READY TO SEND OUT INVITATIONS TO OUR GROUND BREAKING IT'S BEEN A LONG HARD FOUGHT EFFORT TO GET TO THIS POINT. OVER A YEAR AND A HALF BEHIND SCHEDULE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT BY THE TIME WE SERVE WE WERE SERVED WITH THE LAWSUIT THE PROJECT HAD ALREADY HAD ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT METICULOUSLY REVIEWED. NONE THE LESS AND NONE THE LESS. OOPS MY MY RUN PATIENT. AND UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL. THE LAWSUIT CAME IN LATE BASED ON LATE COMMENTS. WE WERE LUCKY AS WE WERE ABLE TO SETTLE ON A VERY FAVORABLE TERMS WHICH IMPORTANTLY DID NOT REQUIRE US. TO WE HAD ALREADY REDUCED THE NUMBERS OF HOMES THROUGH OUR CONVERSATIONS OVER TIME. THIS WAS PROBABLY FOR THREE REASONS ONE BECAUSE OF THE STRONG SUPPORT OF HABITAT HOMEOWNERS IN THE COMMUNITY THERE WERE FIFTY FOUR ALREADY THERE. HUNDREDS OF VOLUNTEERS. AND HUNDREDS OF SUPPORTERS AND DONORS WHO SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF HABIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND BECAUSE THEY GOT THERE IS THEY STILL WANT OTHERS TO GET THERE. TWO BECAUSE OF THE PRO BONO COUNSEL A LAW FIRM THAT WAS COMMITTED TO TAKING OUR OPPONENTS IN LITIGATION ON THE WAY TO TRIAL. AND THREE BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE HABITAT BRAND WHICH MEANT THAT WE COULD SPEAK OUT LOUDLY AND IN PUBLIC ABOUT THE INJUSTICE. EVIDENT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE WELL INTENTIONED BUT ABUSE LAW. NONE THE LESS THE COST HAD ESCALATED BY THEN TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTSUM IN THE OVERHEATED BAY AREA HOUSING MARKET. ALL FOR A DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT THE FEATURED NO LEGITIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. FOR TOO MANY AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS IN CALIFORNIA CIVIL LAWSUITS OF THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS SIMPLY BY ISSUING A LAWSUIT THE PLAINTIFF CAN WREAK HAVOC ON A PROJECT. AND OFTEN THEY'RE ABLE TO EXTRACT SUBSTANTIAL CONCESSIONS FROM DEVELOPERS. DEVELOPERS EITHER FINANCIAL OR REDUCED NUMBERS OF HOMES OR MANY TIMES BOTH. AND BY DEVELOPERS I MEAN HABITAT FOR HUMANITY A DECADE STRONG NONPROFIT THAT PUTS FAMILIES FIRST. NOT SOMEONE BUILDING A BALLPARK. MORE TO THE POINT THE MERE THREAT OF CIVIL LITIGATION HAS A REAL IMPAT ON THOSE MARGINAL DEVELOPMENTS NOT UNDERTAKING AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT. RENDERS THEM ECONOMICALLY UNREALISTIC AT THE OUTSET. I HAVE TO SAY THIS LAWSUIT WOULD SIMPLY HAVE BLOWN ANY OTHER AFFORDABLE ABOUT FOR OUT OF THE WATER WE WERE EXTREMELY FORTUNATE. THAT'S WHY THE SENSIBLE REFORMS OF SICK WILL INDICATION LIKE THOSE PROPOSED IN SB TWENTY FIVE WE'LL HAVE SUCH AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT CAN BE BUILT. FOR WORKING FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA WITH YOUR PERMISSION MISTER CHAIR I WANTED TO BRIEFLY COVER SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THE THE COMMITTEE MAY BE CONSIDERING YOU HAVE AS BRIEFLY AS YOU CAN OKAY I'LL GO REALLY BRIEF THEN. AND I'LL SAY -- WE JUST AREN'T REALLY ANSWER APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT AND THE WORK YOU'VE DONE AND WE SUPPORT ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE THERE AND I WON'T GO THROUGH THEM -- BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT BY -- WE WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE TO ALLOW ACCESS TO SEEK WELL FOR THE FOR THE LEAD CERTIFICATION FOR THE SUNSET CLAUSE -- AND FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THESE PROJECTS NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PROCESS PROGRESS AND WE NEED THEM TO NOT BE STOPPED MISTER CHAIRMAN HABITAT FOR HUMANITY GROUP CALIFORNIA IS GREAT FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION.

GOOD MORNING A STEVE CRUISE ON BEHALF OF WESTFIELD WE DID SUBMIT A LETTER OF OF SUPPORT AND I JUST WENT OVER THE SUPPORT OF FERMENTED POSITION I'D. VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT SENATOR KIRBY ROAD CENTER WAGER DOING -- WHAT WE WERE -- LOOKING AT OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THIS COMMITTEE IS IS FOCUSED ON HAVING PARAMETERS AROUND THE BILL THE WESTFIELD AS A DEVELOPER OF MAJOR SHOPPING CENTERS ACROSS THE WORLD WITH MANY LOCATIONS IN OUR MAJOR CITIES. IN CALIFORNIA THEY MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF DEVELOPING -- LOT OF MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS AND TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES THE CENTER SAID TO BUILD VILLAGES WHERE FOLKS CAN LIVE AND WORK AND REDUCE -- GET A RATHER VEHICLES AND AND SO AS WE DO THAT -- YOU KNOW ARE ENCOUNTERING THE CHALLENGES -- TO THESE PROJECTS AND SO. OPPORTUNITIES OWNS ARE A GOOD START A GOOD MEASUREMENT OF IDENTIFYING THESE HISTORICALLY -- DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES OTHER OTHERS -- LOCATIONS THAT HAS EARNED THAT DESIGNATION AND HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AREAS IN NEED OF INCENTIVES AND SO AS THIS MOVES FORWARD. WE LIKE TO AT LEAST CONSIDER -- SOME OF THE LOCATIONS WHETHER THERE. ENTERPRISE ZONES ARE FORMER REDEVELOPING AREAS OF SOMETHING THAT MIGHT LOOK AT THESE ADDITIONAL AREAS TO HELP BRING -- THESE PROJECTS -- FOR IT SO SHE THE SUPPORT AND WONDER REGISTER THAT WITH THE COMEDIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU I MEAN THAT. YOU GOT IT. YEAH NEWS THAT. MAY BE DIFFERENT WELL -- BUT BUT CERTAINLY I'VE I'VE I'VE ENJOYED SPEAKING WITH YOU AND AND THERE THERE'S A WHOLE SET OF GONNA BLIGHT ISSUES I THINK THEY'RE VALUABLE MPORTANT TALK ABOUT. ON THAT.

AGREEMENT TO REMOVE THE LIMITATION ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AT LEAST IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL-- SO. I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO EXPLORE IT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO KEEP TALKING BUT AND THAT'S IT AMANDA IT'S BEEN AGREED. TO OKAY OTHER FOLKS YOU WANNA RAISE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE DOOR. YEAH. REMEMBERS THEM PHONE FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- IN ADDITION TO THE REASONS. FOR OPPOSITION THAT WE TESTIFIED TO ON THE EARLIER TWO BILLS THERE IS ONE UNIQUE FEATURE ABOUT THIS BILL THAT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC FROM A COURT WORKABILITY STANDPOINT. SO WE'RE CONCERNED WITH THE RECENT ADDITION IN THE BILL. THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE COURT FROM ACCEPTING FOR FILING AN ACTION FROM A PARTY THAT FELL TO PROVIDE THE LEAD AGENCY IN THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST A TEN DAY NOTICE OF INTENT TO SUE. AND THE COURT CLERKS. PERFORM MINISTERIAL DUTIES AND ACCEPTING FILINGS THEY ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE A LEGAL DETERMINATION WHETHER PROPER NOTICE WAS OR WAS NOT. GIVENIN A PARTICULAR CASE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THAT DON'T PRESENT. THE COURT WORKABILITY PROBLEM SO WE WOULD VERY RESPECTFULLY ASK THIS IS YOUR NEGOTIATING MEHMET'S REQUEST THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION BE REMOVED WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALTERNATIVE WAYS THAT THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED. THAT'S A REALLY PROBLEMATIC PROVISION FROM A COURT WORKABILITY STANDPOINT. AND IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER REASONS FOR OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU I SEE THAT AUTHOR NODDING -- OR THIS WITH A CO AUTHOR JOIN OTHER. HI AND I I WILL MAKE SURE THAT OUR STAFFS WORK WITH JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON THAT TOO GHOST INC YOU. THANK YOU CHELSEA TO THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY ENVIRONMENT WE POSED AS BE -- TWENTY FIVE FOR MANY OF THE REASONS WE STAYED IN OUR OPPOSITION TO THE PREVIOUS BILLS -- SIX TWENTY ONE A THREE EIGHTY FOUR AND ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL GOES FAR BEYOND HOUSING. WITH. LIMIT OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND JUDICIAL RELIEF FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF PROJECTS THAT CAN HAVE DETRIMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACTS. IN THE BY THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SYRUPY WORKS -- PRIMARILY IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND KERN COUNTY INTO LARRY COUNTIES WITH LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- AS MOST EVERYONE IS WELL AWARE OF OUR DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED WITH BOTH POLLUTION AND SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTORS. AND EVEN THOUGH THESE COMMUNITIES ARE BLIGHTED THEY'RE NOT JUST -- OPENING ARMS FOR ANY KIND OF INVESTMENT ESPECIALLY NOT INVESTMENTS THAT COULD DIRECTLY HARM THE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. I UNDERSTAND THERE MANY AMENDMENTS THAT RECENTLY -- TAKEN PLACE SO THIS MIGHT BE MOVED BUT AS AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL WITH ITS. APPEAL APPLY A BUNCH OF A FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS IN PARTICULAR CONCERNING IS THE FEDERAL PERTINI FUN IT SEEMS TO BE ABLE. TO INVEST VIRTUALLY ANY TYPE OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INVESTMENTS FROM WAREHOUSES TO LARGE WASTEWATER FACILITIES INTO THESE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES YEAH THAT WAS OUR CONCERN TO AS WRITTEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE HAVE NOW NEAR TE BILL. JUST A HOUSING AND TRANSIT PROJECTS. ARE CELEBRATED AS WRITTEN YES [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH YEAH. OUR OKAY THERE IS THERE IS THE ONE ISSUE IS. PARTICULAR TYPES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS IN OPPORTUNITIES ON SO WE HAVE. TO GET THAT CLARIFIED BUT BUT AT LEAST FOR NON OPPORTUNITIES ON SITUATIONS IT'S IT IS ONLY WE'RE ONLY TALK ABOUT HOUSING IN TRANSIT BY ALL THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE AT LEAST PUB PARTLY PUBLICLY FUNDED -- FOR ANYTHING TO BE COVERED UNDER AS WE TWENTY FIVE BUT THE ONE THING I THINK WE NEED TO ZERO IN ON WHICH IS THE ONE WITH AN AMENDMENT. ALSO INCLUDE THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT FUNDS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY ALSO THOSE ALSO APPLY. TO NON HOUSING PROJECTS LIKE WASTEWATER FACILITIES IN BROWNFIELD REMEDIATION. YEAH THE MEMONS [inaudible] DOES. I HOUSING PROJECTS FUNDED BY THOSE ENTITIES YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT I I BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT I I IT'S HARD I KNOW FOR A LOT OF STRESS YOU OUT OF THE ADVOCATES -- WHO? THERE'S NO QUESTION IT'S BETWEEN FIVE AS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN WAS EXTRAORDINARILY BROAD. AND IT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED BUT I I UNDERSTAND THAT KIND OF YOU GUYS ARE ALL STRUGGLING. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY -- IT'S COVERING ALSO IN IRAQ CLOSE QUICKLY PLEASE YEAH A COUPLE OF THE THE LIMITATION SIZE BEFORE TWENTY FIVE PROPOSES -- PUBLIC PARTICIPATION REALLY UNDERMINING THAT KEY FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF C. QUOTA I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES PROTECT THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. OF IF THEY CANNOT SUBMIT COMMENTS LATE BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THEY DO NOT EVEN FIND OUT ABOUT PROJECTS ON TOP HAS THE COMMON DEADLINE. AND SOMETIMES AFTER THE PROJECTS APPROVED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS EVEN AT THE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACTIVELY MONITOR PROJECT PROPOSALS. AND ADDITIONALLY -- THE BILL PROPOSES AS A PREVIOUSLY STATED TO REQUIRE PARTY TO NOTIFY THE AGENCY OR ELSE FORFEIT THEIR RIGHT TO SUE AND THAT'S ANOTHER HUGE. A HURDLE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR TO BE HEARD IN COURT THAT THEY DESERVE THESE PROJECTS SO WE ARE INJURED NOVO ON THIS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KIM STONE A STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO SUPPORT. AT SEQUESTERING MINING PROVISIONS THAT WOULD INCREASE HOUSING AND OTHER BUILDINGS BUT THERE WERE TWO SPECIFIC LABOR PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD -- AT DISADVANTAGE ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS MEMBERS AS A COMPS PAIRED TO UNION CONTRACTORS THERE'S AN EXEMPTION IF THERE'S A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT FOR THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE REQUIREMENT. IN AN EXEMPTION FOR LABOR COMPLIANCE RECORD KEEPING IF THERE'S A PROJECT. LABOR AGREEMENT THOSE AGREEMENTS DISADVANTAGE OUR MEMBERS AND SO WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANKS. ERIN RUBBER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION ALIGNED WIT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND ASKED TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY TALKS WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND FIXING THAT ONE ISSUE YES THANK YOU. TELLER TRITON ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LEAVE CONSERVATION VOTERS AN OPPOSITION -- BRENNAN DAWSO ABOVE A SIERRA CLUB IN OPPOSITION OF ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW I'M NOT SURE IF THIS WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT AS WELL. BUT ALTHOUGH THIS BILL TAKES SOME PROVISIONS FOR MAYBE NINE HUNDRED SP -- AS WE SEVEN FORTY THREE THIS WILL ACTUALLY EXPAND THE TYPES OF CASES IN THAT THOSE TWO BILLS ACTUALLY REFERRED TO YOU ONLY E. I. OURS IN THIS BILL FOR SENEC DECKS AS WELL AS IN THE NINETIES. AND SO THAT OBVIOUSLY EXPAND THE TYPES OF CASES THAT WOULD RECEIVE EXPEDITED ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CLEARLY -- ISSUE WITH US AS WELL AS SOME OF THE MEMBERS AS FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD AND SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT ESPECIALLY IN OUR POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO CREDIT WITH A NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS DRAFTED WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S HARD WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS ALTHOUGH WE'RE READING TO REVIEW LANGUAGE AND WILL. PROCEED ACCORDINGLY I THINK YOU HAVE. AFTERNOON MICHAEL CLAIBORNE WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT AMENDMENTS AND WILL DEFINITELY REVIEW THOSE. BUT AS WRITTEN WERE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL WOULD FURTHER RESTRICT THE ALREADY LIMITED ABILITY OF COMMUNITIES TO WEIGH IN ON PROJECTS THAT COULD IMPACT THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND NEIGHBORHOODS. AND FOR THAT REASON OPPOSE THANK YOU. HI TIFFANY IN WITH CALIFORNIA VINYL JUST SOMEONE ANSWERS TO HOW WE ARE ALSO OPPOSING THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE AGAIN. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO BUILD MORE HOUSING WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION TO WEAKEN SYKORA. ANSWER MY PROJECTS AND WE DEFINITELY ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY ITS EUROPEAN LEADERSHIP COUNCIL ABOUT PUBLIC REVIEW PERIOD THANK YOU. MATTHEW BIGGER PLANE CONSERVATION THE WEEK TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE HAND OF THE AUTHOR'S BUT ARE OPPOSED TO THE PROPOSED APPROACH. WE DO APPRECIATE THAT -- RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AMENDMENT BY THE COMMITTEE THOUGH I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT MA'AM. AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN AGREED TO AT THIS POINT WE THINK THOSE ARE INDEED IMPROVEMENTS BUT AGAIN DID NOT ADDRESS. THE THE FUNDAMENTAL WHAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY PROBLEMATIC ABOUT THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO EXPEDITED REVIEW [inaudible] OKAY. YOUR NAME RHINO WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WON'T REPEAT ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID IN THE PREVIOUS THREE BELLS -- EXCEPT THAT WE DO. APPRECIATE THE INTENTIONS OF THESE PAST TWO BILLS TWENTY FIVE AND SIX TWENTY ONE AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE APPROACH AND THE AND THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY. THE COMMITTEE BUT AS ONE VERY QUICK COMMENT AND THAT IS THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WHICH IS INVOLVED IN A LOT OF SEQUELS LAWSUITS OVER THE YEARS. HAS THREE TIMES IN THE PAST TWELVE YEARS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS BUILDING IN MONTHS LONG FULL ON DISCUSSIONS OF HOW DO WE EXPEDITE THE SO THAT THERE IS SO THAT AT SEA WAS NOT. SLOWING DOWN BOGGING DOWN COURTS AND AND AND PROJECTS. AND THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY LIMIT ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARILY AN ISSUE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE VERY MUCH BEEN WILLING TO APPROACH IN THE PAST. BUT THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH IN THE CONTEXT OF A FULL PACKAGE A DISCUSSION COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE-ADDRESSED IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT WORK AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN. COM NONE OF THOSE PACKAGES EVER CAME TO FRUITION BECAUSE IT WAS HONESTLY THE POLITICALLY DIFFICULT FOR ALL OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED BUT EVERYBODY WAS THERE FROM. THE DEVELOPERS OVER TO THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY TYPES ALL ALL AROUND THE TAKE. TABLE AND IT IT IT IS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT SORT OF THING WORK IT DOES REQUIRE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PIECES SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ALREADY TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH WELL I MEAN FOR THE FOR EITHER THESE BILLS. TO HAVE A PRAYER OF OF SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK YOU THERE'S GOING TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE PLACE. LET ME LET ME POINT OUT -- JUST TO CLARIFY TWO THINGS AND I I I SHIPMENTS CONFUSION -- ON PAGE THIRTEEN SO MUCH FOR MY FRIEND FROM THE CENTER [inaudible] FROM THE NOW WHAT YES MY FAVOR THE PARTY ON ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS I THINK IT ADDRESSES THE CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE -- WHICH THIS MAN HAS BEEN ACCEPTED -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING -- THE COMMITTEE MAY WISH TO AMEND THE BILL TO INCLUDE THE ELECTRONIC AVAILABILITY DOCUMENTS CLEAN DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO OUR RELIED ON BY THE LEAD AGENCY. THE OPPOSITION LEADERS YOU TO CONSIDER COMMENTS SUBMITTED AFTER THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. WHICH IS THE ISSUE RAISED AND MEDIATION PROVISIONS IN SB TWENTY FIVE TO REMAIN CONSISTENT PRIOR EXPEDITED MINISTER REVIEW LEGISLATION. THAT I THINK ADDRESSES THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED. BY OUR FRIEND OVER HERE THE OTHER THING IS. THAT. ELISE RESCUE TWENTY FIVE ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN THE ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR THE ONLY COPY I IS. THAT WERE WORKING ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING A. M. I. PERCENTAGE MIX. BUT BUT BUT EYOND THAT ONE ISSUE. ARE THE BY THE WAY THE THE THE FORMER HOUSING IN MY PRESENTS MAKES JUST FOR OPPORTUNITIES OWNED HOUSING PROJECTS AS FOR THOSE. THAT PORTION OF THE ISSUES A COVERED BY THE HOUSE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AS SUBMITTED BY THE COMMITTEE -- AND AS ARTICULATE ANALYSIS BY THE AUTHOR -- SO. THERE WE ARE OKAY -- SO THE ITEM IS NOW BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION AND I AND AND YOU KNOW I OBVIOUSLY MEMBERS OUT ONE ADDITIONAL -- CLARIFICATION ON A MAN'S OR WHAT EXACTLY WERE PROVING I'M WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP WITH THAT -- TOO BUT I WOULD THINK YOU HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS. SENATOR THE YOU HAD ON A LAST ALL RIGHT THERE MY ISSUES HAVE BEEN CHANGED YEAH OKAY. I THOUGHTS CONSIDERATIONS. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ONCE AGAIN THIS IS HEADING STRAIGHT TO THE JUDICIARY IF IF APPROVED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND AND A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT PROCESS IN THE COURTS I WILL CERTAINLY BE FULLY VETTED THERE -- IN THIS CASE THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED THE REMOVAL OF LIMITATION TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF EXPLICITLY. I SO. FOR THAT CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED FOR RESCUE. TWENTY FIVE I'VE IF IF. YOU'D LIKE [inaudible] TO AT WELL YEAH IS THAT THE CENTER STONE GONNA MOVE THIS. BILL OKAY I BUT IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS HERE TODAY BOTH THE THOSE IN SUPPORT IN THOSE IN OPPOSITION. THE BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO SOLVE EVERY SINGLE HOUSING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON TRYING TO GAIN SOME CERTAINTY IN ON IN THE IN THE BUILDING COMMUNITY AS I SAID BEFORE. APPRECIATE YOUR OUTLINING THE AMENDMENTS THAT I TOOK BCAUSE I THINK THE ADDRESS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION ISSUES. IN PARTICULAR RESTORING SB SEVEN FORTY THREE LANGUAGE AND THEN THAT REMOVING THE LIMITATION ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND THEN ALSO THE FIVE YEAR SUNSET. THIS IS A PROGRAM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THIS FOR SEVEN YEARS -- BUT HAVING A INFORMATION REPORTED -- TO PR I THINK IS A REAL GOOD WAY OF GETTING DATA. ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT HOW THIS IS USED IN AND WHETHER IT SHOULD BE EXTENDED OR NOT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFULNESS THAT'S GONE INTO HELPING US TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER -- AND I HOPE TO HAVE YOU KNOW AS AS THIS BILL PROCEEDS I HOPE IT WILL GET MORE THAT THE LINE FOR THE OPPOSITION MOVES OVER TO THE LINE FOR THE SUPPORT IF AND SO I I I YEAH I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR WORK ON THIS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU THESE BILLS ARE. WORKS IN PROGRESS ALWAYS BUT AND BUT BUT BUT I I AND I I I WANNA SEE PERSONALLY HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ME THAT -- YOU DO SERIOUS WORK WITH THE FOLKS RAISE CONCERNS. I AND I ALSO WANTED JUST ITERATE GIVEN HOW COMPLEX -- AND AND THE THESE BILLS ARE THAT WE DO WANT TO RETAIN THE RIGHT TO BRING THAT THE BILLS BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE -- AS THEY MOVE FORWARD TO THE PROCESS BUT WITH THAT I'M I'M I'M HAPPY TO VOTE FOR TODAY -- THE ITEMS BEEN MOVED BY CENTERSTONE AND SIX OF HIS COLOR. ITEM NUMBER ONE S. B. TWENTY FIVE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. ALAN HI ALAN HI BAIT HELLO [inaudible] SKINNER [inaudible] STERN. STONE STONE I Y. CASKEY. I CASKEY NO CRAP SO WE'LL HOLD THAT OPEN THE DOOR. FOR THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS AND ON AND LET'S NOW TURN TO YOUR ITEMS. SIX THIS IS SP -- SIX SIXTY NINE RELATING TO SAVE TRICKING WATER THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE SECRET DISCUSSIONS. LOTS MORE TO DO. MOTION ON SIX TWENTY ONE RIGHT JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE HAS AN I MEAN WE'RE GONNA TEAR FROM CENTER STONE IF HE'S INTERESTED IN. PROVIDING OKAY -- THE ITEM SIX TWENTY ONE THAT'S NINE AT NIGHT AT SO AS AS THE FOLKS COME FORWARD TO HELP OUT WITH THAT SB SIX SIXTY NINE WILL ENTERTAIN A VOTE ON SB SIX TWENTY ONE OUT OF DEFERENCE TO THE AUTHOR. SIX EIGHT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM NUMBER FOUR SP SIX TWENTY ONE THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ALAN HI ALAN HI BAIT. IL SKINNER STERN STONE. SIX TWENTY ONE STONE I LIKE CASCADE. I CAST AFTER THAT THAT WILL. REMAIN OPEN OKAY SO WE'RE NOT GONNA TURN ITEM SIXTEEN YEAR AGENDAS MEMBERS THIS IS SB SIX SIXTY NINE RELATING TO THE SAFE DRINKING WATER FIND ITS -- CENTER COPIER [inaudible] VERY MUCH. SHARE AND SENATORS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. SIX SIX NINE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE SAFE DRINKING WATER FUND. AND THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST. THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AS A DEN A FIGHT OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS. RIGHT TO WATER PORTAL THE CHRONICALLY FAIL TO SERVICE SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE SYSTEMS ARE SMALL RURAL SYSTEMS SERVING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MANY OF WHICH ARE IN MY DISTRICT. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION IS LONG OVERDUE. A KEY PART OF SELLING THIS CRISIS IS THE CREATION OF A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE TO ASSIST THE STRUGGLING PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. PARTICULARLY FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE R. O. N. M. COSTS WHICH GENERALLY CANNOT BE FUNDED WITH THE EXISTING FEDERAL. AND STATE SAFE DRINKING WATER SOURCES. SENATE BILL SIX SIX NINE WOULD ADDRESS THE GAP IN FUNDING AT THE STATE LEVEL BY CREATING THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST. THE TRUST WOULD BE CREATED IN THE STATE TREASURY AND BE FINANCED WITH GENERAL FUND DOLLARS DURING A BUDGET SURPLUS YEAR. THE RECORD STATE BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR MAKE MAKES IT A PERFECT TIME TO CREATE AND FUND THE TRUST IN THIS ACTUALLY COULD BE FUNDED OVER AT A NUMBER OF YEARS -- THE TRUST'S PRINCIPLES WOULD BE INVESTED IN THE NET INCOME WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO A SAFE DRINKING WATER FIND THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. WOULD USE TO FIND SOLUTIONS ON THE GROUND AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR IT -- INAM AND FUNDING FOR CONSOLIDATIONS REPLACEMENT WATER AND SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION. FINDING THE TRUST WITH GENERAL FUND DOLLARS DURING A BUDGET SURPLUS YEAR WOULD TAP INTO A PROGRESSIVE SOURCE OF INCOME TAX REVENUE. INSTEAD OF CREATING A REGRESSIVE DRINKING WATER TAX ON WATER USERS THAT ADDS TO THE COST OF WATER. THE MOST RECENT STATE NEEDS ASSESSMENT ONLY ADDRESSES UNSAFE WATER SYSTEMS WITH FIFTEEN OR MORE CONNECTIONS AND DOES NOT ADDRESS PRIVATE WELLS AND STATE SMALL SYSTEMS. BY FOCUSING ON WATER ON COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SB SIX SIX NINE WOULD COMPLEMENT EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING SOURCES FOR CAPITAL COSTS. BYE FOR PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THE NM NEEDS THAT THE STATE PRELIMINARY PRELIMINARILY ASSESSED IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THIS MEANS. THAT SB SIX SIX NINE IS THE FASTEST WAY TO IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSED THE NEEDS OF THE LARGEST AFFECTED POPULATIONS IN THE NEAREST TIME FRAME. THIS IS A REASONED APPROACH TO MANAGING THIS CRISIS NOW. WHILE THE WATER BOARD USES THE THREE MILLION IN FUNDING PROVIDED TO THEM LAST YEAR BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE HOW TO ASSESS THE NEEDS FOR INDIVIDUAL WELLS AND STATE SMALL SYSTEMS. ILLITERATE A LINEAR LINEAR APPROACH FIXING EACH WELL WANTED TIME IS INEFFICIENT AND NOT SUSTAINABLE. SB SIX SIX NINE WOULD PROVIDE A DURABLE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE WHILE KEEPING WATER FOR DOUBLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND GIVE THE WATER BOARD THE ROOM TO CONDUCT ITS DUE DILIGENCE FOR DRESSING THE NON REGULATED SMALL SYSTEMS AND PRIVATE WELLS. WITH ME TODAY TO PRY TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OR CINDY TECH FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AND DANIELLE BUT BY A SET FROM THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU TERRY ALLEN AND MEMBERS CINDY TACK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE SUPPORT THE BILL WERE A CO SPONSOR WITH CMU WAY. EVERYBODY WHO'S WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AGREES THAT THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM THAT HAS TO BE SOLVED. EVERYBODY WHO'S WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AGREES THERE NEED TO BE NEEDS TO BE A FUNDING SOLUTIONS THIS YEAR. AND WE APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THAT TOPIC WE THINK THAT THE TRUST PROPOSED AN SP SIX SIX NINE IS A GOOD SOLUTION. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUMMARY DOCUMENT. THERE'S A QUOTE AT PAGE ONE TWENTY SIX THE SAYS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REMAINING CHALLENGE IS THE LACK OF STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG TERM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. OF DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. NO THIS BILL SB SIX SIX NINE IS NOT LIMITED TO FUNDING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS BUT IT WOULD ADDRESS THAT HE FUNDING GAP. SP SIX SIX NINE FOCUSES ON COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT CHRONICALLY VIOLATE THE FEDERAL OR STATE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS IN SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY NEED. FUNDING ASSISTANCE IT WOULD ADDRESS -- IN INCLUDE NITRATE IN ITS SCOPE AND IT INCLUDES THE OTHER. CONTAMINANTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE FEDERAL OR STATE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR CONSOLIDATION AND CONSOLIDATIONS AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS THAT WOULD NEED OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FUNDING. SO THAT'S A POSITIVE ASPECT AS WELL IT'S ALSO HAS FUNDING FOR REPLACEMENT WATER AND FOR ADMINISTRATOR OR MANAGERIAL -- CONTRACTORS. NO THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISM TO PROPOSALS FOR WATER TAX RIGHT NOW IN THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S TWO OF THOSE ONE IS IN BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THAT LANGUAGE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE THAT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION HAD LAST YEAR AND THAT DID NOT PASS. THERE'S ALSO A WATER TAX PROPOSED IN EIGHTY TWO SEVENTEEN ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR A TRUST IS A BETTER APPROACH FOR MANY REASONS THE Q. ONE THAT'LL MENTION FOR THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT. THE TRUST WOULD NOT ADD TO THE COST OF WATER IT WOULDN'T MAKE WATER LESS AFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT OF COURSE SENATOR CAFIERO MENTIONED THAT. ON WITH THE RECENT -- IN RECORD BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN FUND THE TRUST WITH A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THAT BUDGET SURPLUS. SO WE ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO MOVE THE BILL IT'S A GOOD SOLUTION WE ARE TONIGHT. THANK YOU. NOW NO MORE BIRTHDAY BASH. YEAH. ALTHOUGH I GOT A TIARA BIRTHDAY WEEK BUT THE BIRTHDAY WEEK NO I I WOULD LOVE A BIRTHDAY MONTH THAT OKAY ALL RIGHT THERE YOU GO OKAY. BUT I DID HAVE A VERY NICE BIRTHDAY THANK YOU HEARD OF MY NAME IS DANIEL BLASTED WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD OF BECAUSE SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS OF SB -- SIX SIX NINE AS OUTLINED BY THE AUTHOR AND OUR CO SPONSOR WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND NEEDS TO BE SOLVED -- THE SENATOR IN OUR COSPONSORED DID A GREAT JOB EXPLAINING THE TRUST SO I AM GOING TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON THE CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION WE ASK THE SERGEANT TO DISTRIBUTED DOCUMENT TO ALL OF YOU TODAY. IT OUTLINES THOSE -- CONCERNS AND OUR RESPONSES IN DETAIL BUT I'M GONNA FOCUS ON JUST A COUPLE TODAY -- THERE'S A CONCERN THAT THE PRESS DOESN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH FUNDING BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO FIRST ADDRESS THE EXISTING ESTIMATES TO TRY AND TACKLE THE FUNDING NEEDED -- THESE ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY BETWEEN FORTY THREE AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THE FORTY THREE MILLION WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH A NEEDS ASSESSMENT BY THE STATE WATER BOARD. AND AS FOR AN M. COST -- WHICH AS WAS NOTED IS THE MAJOR FUNDING GAP THE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION ACTUALLY INCLUDES ONAM COSTS AND AND CAPITAL COSTS FOR WHICH THERE IS ALREADY FINDING. AND WAS GENERATED BY A THIRD PARTY -- CONSULTANT AND IN THE CONSULTANTS ESTIMATE THERE WAS AN ADMISSION THAT THERE'S NO STATEWIDE STUDY YOUR COMPREHENSIVE DATA QUANTIFY THE COST. AND IN ADDITION THE STATE WATER BOARD SAID IN THEIR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SAFE DRINKING WATER PLAN. THE COSTS OF REQUIRING PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS SERVING LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND SERVICE CONNECTIONS TO ME PRIMARY DRINKING WATER STANDARDS CANNOT BE ACCURATELY ESTIMATED GIVEN THE VARIABLES INVOLVED IN SUCH AN ESTIMATE. AS NOTED IN NEED NEEDS ASSESSMENT BY THE BOARD IS UNDER WAY BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE TOTAL NEED IS NOT FROM YOU FOR ME IT FIRMLY BEEN ESTABLISHED. AS ENVISIONED THE TRUST WOULD GENERATE MORE THAN THE AMOUNT ESTIMATED BY THE STATE BOARD AND IF MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED IN THE FUTURE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE LEGISLATURE FROM ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO THE TRUST TO GENERATE THAT AMOUNT. AND LASTLY THERE'S ALSO CONCERNS THAT THE TRUST IS LIMITED IN THE UNIVERSE OF SYSTEMS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING -- I THINK THAT AS SENATOR CAFIERO INTERPOSE SPONSOR OUTLINES I'M OUR POSITION ON THAT BUT WE DO BELIEVE THE NEW ASSESSMENT IS EXPECTED TO EXPLORE WAYS TO ASSESS AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PRIVATE WELLS AND STATE SMALL SYSTEMS. INCLUDING CONSOLIDATION WHICH WE BELIEVE -- WOULD BE THE SOLUTION FOR MANY OF THESE AREAS AND WOULD REDUCE THE OVERALL NEED. AND WE BELIEVE THE TRUST -- IS A BETTER APPROACH FOR SOLVING THIS ISSUE IT DOES NOT RELY ON A REGRESSIVE TAX ON WATER. AND I WOULD PROVIDE THE FUNDING NEEDED FOR SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BY BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE BOARD IS NEEDING ASSISTANCE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I'VE OUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER FOLKS WANNA WIN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE -- GREG'S LAWMAKERS ARE OUR WATER RATE PAYERS MONEY HARD AT WORK HERE. AT GREG'S LONIGAN THE SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT -- REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. MORNING I'M BROOK JONES AND PRESIDENT OF THE R. LINDA WATER DISTRICT. AND I HAVE A FEW THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS BILL WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. ACCESS TO SAFE CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND RESIDENTS. WE THEREFORE SUPPORT SB. SIX SIXTY NINE WE THINK THAT'S B. SIX SIXTY NINE IS PREFERABLE TO THE APPROACHES DESCRIBED THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL IN A B.. TWO SEVENTEEN WHICH INVOLVES. A WATER TAX. FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. I THINK IT'S BAD POLICY. TO HAVE A WATER TAX. TAX WATER IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE. IT SHOULD BE TAX FREE TAXING WATER IS REGRESSIVE. HARDER ON THE POOR WE JUST THINK WATER SHOWS UP FOR FREE NICE AND CLEAN NO ONE PAYS FOR IT. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DELIVERY I BET SOMEONE PAIN FOR ERIC COMES FROM HEAVEN IT'S YOURS OKAY ALL RIGHT. FAXING WATER IS INEFFICIENT. IMPOSING A NEW BUREAUCRACY OF TAX COLLECTORS WITHIN CITIZENS. CITIES IN WATER DISTRICTS AND IT MAKES THE WATER MORE EXPENSIVE. TAXING WATERS DIFFICULT PRECEDENT UNDO. AND TAXES WILL LIKELY BECOME MORE ONEROUS AS TIME GOES ON TAXING WATER BUILD FUNDS RESERVES TAKE TIME. WELL THE NEED FOR SOLUTIONS IS URGENT. THE OTHER HAND SB SIX SIXTY NINE PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES. IT IMMEDIATELY FINDS A SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST FUND BY PROVIDING STATE BUDGET SURPLUS DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. ENABLING QUICK ACTION. IT ALSO PROVIDE WE'RE GONNA ASK IT IS A WEEK WE'VE HEARD FROM TWO I'M I'M I'M NOT I'M SORRY TO BE BEHIND ME. YEAH OKAY. FINALLY WHEN MATED WITH SP. FOUR ONE FOUR IT PROVIDES A PERMANENT FIX. MAKING PEOPLE SELF SUFFICIENT ALL THE DISTRICTS SELF SUFFICIENT. AND WE'D STRONGLY SUPPORT BOTH SIX SIXTY NINE AND FOUR FOURTEEN I SENT A COUPLE YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR IMAGE. I I FEEL ARE NOT TAKING TIME HERE TODAY FOR EAST VALLEY WATER DISTRICT AND ALSO YOU A WATER AGENCY AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE AUTHOR'S INTELLIGENCE INNOVATIVE AND WATER TAX AVOIDING APPROACH.

MAY RECEIVE ALREADY. GOOD MORNING -- CHAIR AND MEMBERS JONATHAN NELSON COMMUNITY WATER CENTER'S. FOR OVER TEN YEARS NOW WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR THE MORE THAN ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT SAFE WATER. POISONED BY EVERYTHING FROM LEAD IN URBAN AREAS TO NITRATES ARSENIC IN RURAL AREAS. EVEN THOUGH WE OPPOSE SB SIX SIX NINE AND HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE INTEREST BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL. WE ARE DEEPLY RESPECTFUL OF THE SENATOR AND WE ARE RESPECTFUL OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY AND IT WILL CONTINUE IN THE COMING WEEKS. SO WE COME HERE TODAY WITH JUST ONE SIMPLE REQUEST TO THIS COMMITTEE AND TO THE SENATE. PLEASE PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS AND MAKE SURE WE LEAVE NO ONE OUT OF A SOLUTION AS WE ACT THIS YEAR. YOU SEE THE VERY PREMISE OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUN CAMPAIGN. REFLECTED IN PROPOSALS BY THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION SUMMIT MEMBER AND WATER GARCIA AND SENATOR MINING. IS THAT WE ARE ONE STATE. AND THAT BY JOINING HANDS TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE SURE EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS ACCESS TO SAFE WATER. MAKE NO MISTAKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY WILL STAND FIRM. AGAINST ANY PROPOSAL THAT WOULD LEAVE OUT ENTIRE SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. AS SB SIX SIX NINE WOULD DO. BY LIMITING ASSISTANCE TO WATER SYSTEMS OF A CERTAIN TYPE AND SIZE. YOU WOULD EXCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED SCHOOLS AND AN ESTIMATED TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL ALSO MERELY PROVIDES A PROMISE OF ASSISTANCE IT WOULD NOT ACTUALLY PROVIDE RELIEF UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SECURED A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OF GENERAL FUND FUNDING. WHICH BOTH WE IN THE ALLEY -- ESTIMATE WOULD BE OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IT WOULD BE BOTH THE GREATEST IRONY AND A GRAVE INJUSTICE AT THE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT STARTED THIS EFFORT WERE THE ONES DENIED SAFE WATER AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE ARE TIRED OF LIVING A SECOND CLASS CITIZENS WITH SECOND CLASS WATER. WE MUST NOT TO OUR ACTIONS TODAY AND IN THE COMING WEEKS PERPETUATE THAT INJUSTICE ANY LONGER [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND HAPPY THE LOTUS WORK THAT DAY. MY NAME IS CAMILLA TRAVIS I AM THE DAUGHTER OF THE LOTUS WORK THEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE THE LOTUS WORTH THE FOUNDATION AND MET A MOTHER OF TWO SMALL CHILDREN. I AM HERE TO EXPRESS MY GRAVE CONCERN ABOUT SB SIX SIX NINE I AM HERE IN SOLIDARITY WITH EVERY CALIFORNIAN THAT LACKS ACCESS TO SAFE. CLEAN DRINKING WATER I LIVE IN RURAL KERN COUNTY AND HAVE EXPERIENCED THE LACK OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER FIRSTHAND. I LIVE IN THE TINY UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITY OF KEEN THE HOME OF THE NATIONAL CHAVIS CENTER MY NEIGHBORS AND I PAY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR WATER THAT IS CHECKED IN FROM TEN MILES AWAY FROM THE TO HATCHET BE WATER BASIN. IT'S BEEN STORED AND A LARGE TANK AND PUMPED UP TO OUR HOME WE CANNOT DRINK OR COOK WITH THIS WATER THE WATER SYSTEM IS OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD WHO HAS NEGLECTED TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN OUR WATER SYSTEM. AROUND NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE UNION PACIFIC REMOVED A TEN MILE WATER LINE FROM TO HATCH SHOULD BE TOO KEEN AND REPLACED IT WITH A MALFUNCTIONING WELL. SYSTEM THAT WENT DRY OVER TEN YEARS AGO SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE RAILROAD WANTED TO ABANDON THE COMMUNITY BUT WE SUED BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND WON OUR FIGHT TO REQUIRE UNION PACIFIC TO CONTINUE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. LAST SUMMER THE PUMP BROKE AND WE WERE WITHOUT WATER FOR OVER A WEEK BEFORE THE PROBLEM WAS IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED. SOME KEEN RESIDENTS HAVE WELLS AND WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM S. B. SIX SIX NINE CALIFORNIANS DRINKING WATER CRISIS IS UNFAIR. AN EQUAL AND UNDRESSED YES THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE EXCLUDING THE MOST VULNERABLE AROUND US FROM HAVING SAFE WATER. THAT'S WHY WE'VE SUPPORTED GOVERNOR NEWSOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT AUTO GARCIA AND SENATOR MINING BY ADVOCATING FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUN WHICH WILL HELP EVERYONE. FOR THOSE THAT SAY WE CANNOT PASS THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUN AND INCLUDE ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH A C. SEP WHETHER. IT CAN BE DONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHER FOLKS WANNA RAISE CONCERNS ARE VOICED OPPOSITION. THANK YOU -- JIM WINBERG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIA -- WERE VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT -- GENERAL FUND FORMULAS THAT ONLY PROVIDE FUNDING -- IN SURPLUS YEARS WEKNOW THAT MINERAL FUN REVENUES ARE VERY VOLATILE -- GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE AND SERIOUSNESS OF THIS PROBLEM WE REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED A DEDICATED AN ONGOING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE. THANK YOU. THREE THE BREAKFAST ON BEHALF OF SERIES THREE'S IS A GROUP OF LARGE BUSINESSES WORKED WORKING TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES IN OPPOSITION. ONE OF THE MEAT ON A WITHOUT AMONG CALIFORNIAN. OPPOSITION. THE MORNING PUBLIC GARCIA WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND IN OPPOSITION WE SUPPORT -- WE APPRECIATE THE CONSTRUCTIVE THINKING BUT DON'T. BELIEVE THERE'S A SUBSTITUTE FOR DEDICATED FUNDING. THANK. THESE ARE WHAT. W. FUNDING [inaudible] SUBSTITUTE OKAY. MORNING MICHAEL CLAIBORNE WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- IN OPPOSITION WE WORK WITH THE RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES YOU STRUGGLE WITH WATER KEPT A QUALITY CONTAMINATION. I AND MANY OF THOSE RESIDENTS RELY ON PRIVATE WELLS. THAT ARE CONTAMINATED. FOR EXAMPLE -- RAMON NEAR DELL HI HO VITA IN TOMBSTONE TERRITORY TORY IN FRESNO COUNTY -- THOSE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RELIANT ON PRIVATE WELLS AND WE'RE WORKING TO EXTEND OUT PUBLIC DRINKING WATER SERVICE TO THOSE COMMUNITIES -- THIS SOLUTION WOULDN'T ACTUALLY FUN THOSE SOLUTIONS -- WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THOSE PROJECTS AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T LEAVE COMMUNITIES BEHIND. REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY GET THEIR DRINKING WATER -- AND WE THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT THIS YEAR -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A CAFE NANDO'S DOMESTIC PRIOR WELL OWNER WITHIN SAVE WATER AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANKS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JOSEPHINE YET TO COME FROM A SMALL COMMUNITY AND FOR REAL -- A MOTHER A GRANDMOTHER AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE PRIVATE WALLET OWNER SURE ALSO HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ROSIE HERNANDEZ AND I'M FROM WEST GOSHEN I'M HERE REPRESENTING I'VE -- I WHAT COLLISION AND ALSO REPRESENT AN OP OVER THIRTY HOMES IN MY COMMUNITY THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND WITH WHEN WE CONNECTED TO THE CITY AND THEY DO SEARCHES BUT HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND WE OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. AND ALL THE OTHER NUMBER IS THE ONE ON THE LINE YEAH. THE LEARNER POSSIBLY BY THE IF THEN CONSIDER THIS TO BE THE FIFTH. SASHA HER NAME WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JULIE AT CHRISTIAN SMITH I'M WITH THE WATER FOUNDATION WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WITH MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES HERE FOR MANY YEARS. AND AS I'M SURE MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A REAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM IT'S ONLY A PARTIAL PEACE OF THE PICTURE AND SO WE ARE IN OPPOSITION. JENNIFER CLARY ON BEHALF OF CLEAN WATER ACTION AN AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION -- WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S FORTY SEVEN SCHOOLS ON THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER LISTED CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER THEY'RE NOT THEY WOULDN'T BE HELPED BY THIS BILL. MONTEREY COUNTY OVERSEAS NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY WATER SYSTEMS WITH FEWER THAN FIFTEEN CONNECTIONS THEY WOULD NOT BE HELPED BY THIS BILL SO WE WOULD REALLY LIKE A COMPLETE SOLUTION THANK YOU [inaudible] DID YOU. VVC LEADERSHIP COUNCIL REGISTERING OPPOSITION FOR POLICY LINK SEE EARLY FOUNDATION -- AND AND SELF HELP ENTERPRISES AS A ALONG WITH THE COMMUNITY GROUP COMMUNITY UNITED IN ONE HOUR. MATTHEW BIGGER PLANNING CONSERVATION THE PCO DOES APPRECIATE THE NEED HERE AND THE INTENT -- BUT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES THE APPROACH. THANK YOU OKAY. I SAW THE ITEM IS NOW BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND THOUGHTS -- A CINEMA CASKEY. THE LECTURE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE INCLUDED ON THIS BILL -- WE DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD I'M. AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT COULD CUT THIS ONCE WHEN WE ASK ONE OF THE ONE OF THE IN ONE ONE ONE OF YOU TO COME AND ONE OF YOU. TO SO WE HAVE A BALANCE. THE QUESTION. FOR AGAIN IT'S A NICE LECTURE ABOUT THE MILLION PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER BUT THERE'S ONLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION THE STATE WATER RESOURCE BOARD WHICH WE HAVE JURISDICTION TO DO SOMETHING. IS THAT CORRECT. THE AUTHOR. IN THE MORNING TILL IN EVERY BILL THAT'S COME BEFORE US ARE BILLS THAT ARE TAILORED FOR AREAS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS JURISDICTION OVER RIGHT IS THAT CORRECT. WELL I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE MINING BILL. IT'S NOT FAIR BUT RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS WITH THE SAME UNIVERSE. PART OF WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS PART OF THE OBJECTION HERE IS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE WELLS THAT ARE NOT THAT ARE NON POSSIBLE WATER. THEY WANT THIS BILL TO FIX IT AND PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE 14% OR FOURTEEN HOOK UPS THAT ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF STATE WATER RESOURCE BOARD WHAT YOUR BILL THE FIX IT. AND PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVE WATER SYSTEM ONE RUN BY A RAILROAD VERSUS THE STATE WATER RESEARCH ESTATE COMMUNITY BOARD WHAT YOUR BILL FIX IT AND MY UNDERSTANDING PLEASE CORRECT ME IS THAT WE% DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION. TO DO THAT. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL SO SO THAT'S A DIFFERENT SOLUTION THAT'S A DIFFERENT THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT I'D SAY THAT'S THAT'S IT WE'RE BEING URGED TO OPPOSE THIS FOR IT ONLY FIX IS HALF OF THE PROBLEM. AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF BILLS ON CONSOLIDATION INCLUDING EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S A WATER DISTRICT HAS NO REASON WHATSOEVER WHATSOEVER SCHOOL DISTRICT. HAVING A OF WATER DISTRICT THAT DOESN'T JOIN AN ADJOINING WATER DISTRICT AND YOU'VE DONE LEGISLATION AND I'VE DONE LEGISLATION AND THEY'LL BE MORE LEGISLATION FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO CONSOLIDATE AND JOIN BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO DO. I HAVE OTHER REASONS TO OPPOSE THIS BILL BUT BUT THE BUT BUT THE REASONS FOR BEING PRO PROPER HERE BY OPPOSITION HAVE SOMETHING O DO WITH ENTIRELY. DIFFERENT PROBLEM WORSE THAT WERE SOLD WE'RE TOLD THAT WE SHOULDN'T FIX HALF THE PROBLEM UNLESS WE FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS AND THAT'S NOT IN THERE ARE JURISDICTIONS THERE'S FIFTY A COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. GO GET HIM GO ASK THE QUESTIONS MAR A OTHER QUESTION IS ON THE CORPUS OF THE STRESS. THE ONE POINT. THREE OUT OF GIVE YOU THE THE THE THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S PRODUCED WITH THAT -- AND I UNDERSTAND WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK AND ADD TO THE CORPUS I I I GET THAT. I DON'T SEE ANY PRIORITY THAT'S PUT HERE ON THAT HOW THAT WOULD BE [inaudible] DIVVIED UP. IS THERE ANY INTENTION HERE OR IS THIS SORT OF FIRST COME FIRST SERVE WHO'S WHO NEEDS -- NM YEAH THE DATA. WE HAD. A LITTLE BIT DOWN THE LINE NICE I REALIZE. THIS BILL PROPOSES THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD WOULD HAVE A PROCESS WITH AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN INCLUDING STAKEHOLDER INPUT INTO THAT. SO IT DOESN'T SAY ABSOLUTELY THIS CATEGORY HAS TO GO FIRST TO HAVE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY THERE'S FLEXIBILITY ON IT. AND THE THE KEY IS THE PUBLIC PROCESS AT THE STATE WATER BOARD IN THAT PLAN AND CONCEIVABLY THE WATER RESOURCE BOARD WHO IS CHARGED WITH. HELPING CONSOLIDATE UNDER PERFORMING AND NON PERFORMING DISTRICTS COULD USE THIS AS A CARROT FOR EITHER AN ASSOCIATION OF THREE UNDER PRFORMING DISTRICTS TO COME TOGETHER TO TRY. TO GET IT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT NOT THAT JOINS WITH ANOTHER PERFORMING DISTRICT THAT GETS THE O. N. M. THAT THEY NEED TO GET IT UP IS THAT YOUR THINKING MADAM. AUTHOR IT IS MY THINKING AND NOT ONLY THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE BOND FUNDS THAT PROVIDE. RESOURCES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OR THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THE PROJECTS AND SO THIS IS THE O. N. M. IT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO TO GET THAT GOING BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES CARE PRESUMABLY IF EVER. IF WE GET MANAGEMENT IN THERE THAT KNOWS HOW THIS WORKS.% UP TO SNUFF THE NECK WOULD BE IMPROVED. I HAVE STILL SOME CONCERNS HERE BUT I'M VERY. I GUESS SOME OF YOUR CHARGE YOU'RE IN CHARGE I'M I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD AT IT I I I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL WILL BE PROCEEDING THERE'S THIS DEBATE IS NOT THE LAST ONE THAT WE HAVE ON MAY I HAVE THE OPPOSITE THAT OPPORTUNITY RESPONDED AT THE RIGHT TIME. SOME OF THE POINTS RAISED HAPPY. I ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WANT TO ASK A QUESTION OR MAKE COMMENTS. AND THEY DON'T ALL IS THERE A MOTION [inaudible] FOR US. THE MOVE BY SENATOR STONE ON SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HELLO I'M SORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR KERR YEAH ACTUALLY ASKED FOR AND I THINK YOU. THE ITEM NUMBER SIX SP SIX SIX NINE THE MOTION IS DO PASS TO THE SENATE GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. ALAN. WAIT. BAIT HI HILL. IL I SKINNER. SKINNER ICE STERN STERN I STONE. STONE I I KELSEY. MY CAL SKINNER [inaudible] WITH A THAT'S FIVE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN. BECAUSE OF WHERE WE ARE BILL FORTY YEAH [inaudible] PLEASE [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] ARE YOU [inaudible] RULER LET'S [inaudible] RATHER THAN [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. THIS IS ITEM MINE NUMBER TWO AND ARE SENT TO SKINNER. THANKS SO MUCH -- ITEM NUMBER FIVE I'M NOT IN THE RIGHT POSITION IT'S S. P. FORTY FOUR CORRECT YEAH THREE FORTY FOUR THANK YOU WONDERFUL THANK YOU -- VICE CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN WITH I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AND THEN WHY DID I INTRODUCE SP. FORTY FOUR SEVEN OUT OF THE CAN CITIES IN THE US WITH THE MOST POLLUTED AIR STILL TODAY. ARE IN CALIFORNIA. FOSSIL FUEL POWERED. FOSSIL FUEL DIESEL POWERED TRUCKS AND BUSES ARE SIGNIFICANT SOURCE. OF THAT POLLUTION. JAZZ THAT CATEGORY OF VEHICLES ALONE. ARE RESPONSIBLE 433%. OF THE SMOG CAUSING POLLUTION SERVE THE EMISSIONS THAT CREATE THE SMOG. AND 25% OF OUR TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION WHICH IS THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF EMISSIONS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER IS PARTICULARLY [inaudible] HARMFUL. TO LONGS TO CHILDREN AND THERE'S A LINK. BETWEEN DIESEL EXHAUST IN CANCER AND HEART DISEASE. INTERESTINGLY A RESEARCH REPORT OUT OF EUROPE. FOUND THAT MORE PEOPLE IN EUROPE DIE EARLY. PRIME DIESEL CARS BAD AIR QUALITY THAN FROM CIGARETTES. WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT SITUATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT S. B. FORTY FOUR DOES IS DIRECT OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD. TO HELP. DEVELOP A PLAN FOR HOW ARE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE SECTOR THOSE VEHICLES THAT MOST RELY ON PETROLEUM BASED DIESEL. CAN HELP MEET OUR CLEAN AIR AND ARE. CARBON REDUCTION GOALS AND NOW I WILL ALLOW MY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT TO SPEAK [inaudible] THE CENTER. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M RUNNING SHORT ON BEHALF OF CAL START WERE -- TECHNOLOGY CONSORTIUM THAT'S BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO ACCELERATE THE COMMERCIALIZATION. AD GROWTH OF THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS HAVE GIVEN RISE TO A RENAISSANCE IN VEHICLE MANUFACTURING IN THIS STATE. SHOP HERE TO RESEARCH DESIGN BUILD CLEAN VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES. ACROSS ALL VEHICLE CLASSES COMPANIES LIKE FOR TERRA MOTIVE B. Y. DE TESLA CHANGE. GREEN POWER TRANSPARENT. ARE JUST A FEW THE MANUFACTURERS THAT HAVE COME HERE TO THIS STATE AND ARE GROWING OUT BECAUSE OF CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS. THESE COMPANIES ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF WHAT COULD BE TO COME. AS A RESULT MANY NEW VEHICLE CLASSES IN THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE SPACE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING OR HAVE ALREADY BECOME COMMERCIALIZED. AS LONG AS IT STAYS STAYS THE COURSE WITH THIS CLINIC IN MINUTES THESE TRENDS WILL NOT ONLY CONTINUE BUT INCREASE. SB FORTY FOUR IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IN OUR STATE PLANNING EFFORTS TO KEEP RATIONING DOWN VEHICLE EMISSIONS AND SIGNALING TO MANUFACTURERS THAT WE ARE NOT BACKING DOWN FROM OUR COMMITMENTS. PARALLEL TO THIS STATE IN THAT IT INVESTMENT INCENTIVE FUNDING FROM CAP AND TRADE IS ALSO CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING THE COMMERCIALIZATION PROCESS TO CREATE THE INDUCEMENTS NEEDED FOR COMPANIES TO KEEP BUILDING A PIPELINE OF ADVANCE CLEAN TRUCK. BUS AND OFFERED EQUIPMENT. TO MAKE A PROGRAM FOR BUILDING NEW IN MAY MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY SUCCESSFUL THERE NEEDS TO BE PROGRAM CERTAINTY SEVERAL YEARS AHEAD. THAT IS BECAUSE IT TAKES MANUFACTURES OF OF TRUCKS AND BUSES FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS TO BRING IN NEW PRODUCT TO MARKET. AND THOSE MANUFACTURERS ARE UNLIKELY TO START THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A NEW VEHICLE UNLESS THEY CAN LOOK OUT AND HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE DEMAND AND THE PARTNERSHIPS AVAILABLE OVER THAT WHOLE TIME FRAME. ALSO FLEET OPERATORS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SCHEDULE BOTH LONG THE VEHICLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS MULTIPLE YEARS IN ADVANCE AND UNLESS THEY HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS AVAILABLE MULTIPLE YEARS OUT. THEY'LL HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING INVESTMENTS BEYOND ISOLATED EXPERIMENTS. BUSINESSES ARE MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ON A LONG TERM BASIS AND THE STATE NEEDS TO MORE CLOSELY SEE SYNCHRONIZE ITS APPROPRIATIONS AND PROGRAMS WITH THESE INVESTMENT CYCLES. AND DOING SO WOULD HELP TO BRING THE MARKET. TO MORE OF THESE VEHICLES THE MARKET FASTER AND CONTINUE TO DRAW MORE MANUFACTURERS IN INVESTMENTS TO THE STATE FOR THESE REASONS WE WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR I'VE A THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I'M WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA. EMISSIONS FROM THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY DIESEL TRUCKS SECTOR ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL POLLUTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH BURDENS INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESS. CANCERS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN HEALTH IMPACTS OF PREMATURE DEATHS. THESE BURNS ARE NOT EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AS MANY COMMUNITIES FACE DISPROPORTIONATE BURDENS AN ELEVATED CANCER RISKS DUE TO NEARBY DIESEL HOT SPOTS LIKE OUR PORTS IN WAREHOUSES. THOROUGHLY WORKERS FACE HGHER HEALTH RISK DUE TO GREATER OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES TO DIESEL EXHAUST. DIESEL EXHAUST IS CLASSIFIED AS A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. IT IS CLASSIFIED AS A HUMAN CARCINOGEN BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER. DIESEL EMISSION ENGINE EMISSIONS ARE BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT 70% OF CALIFORNIANS ESTIMATED KNOWN CANCEROUS CONTRIBUTED BOLTED TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE SHOWS A PARTICLE POLLUTION LIKE THAT COMING FROM DIESEL ENGINES. CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF HEART DISEASE LUNG CANCER ASTHMA ATTACKS THE GREATER USE OF ASTHMA MEDICATIONS AND CAN INTERFERE WITH THE LUNG FUNCTION AND DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN. PARTICLE POLLUTION AND KNOCKS EMISSIONS FROM DIESEL TRUCKS CAN IMPACT ANYONE'S HEALTH BUT OUR CHILDREN THE ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA HEART DISEASE AND OTHER CHRONIC ILLNESSES. ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THEIR FAX. THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE ALSO A MAJOR SOURCE OF CLIMATE POLLUTION THAT THREATENS% PUBLIC HEALTH TODAY. AND FOR GENERATIONS COMING FORWARD FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR AND THANK THE AUTHOR BRING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. FOR THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING TEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATTHEW MONSON WITH PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE AND ALSO -- PROGRAM THE REGIONAL ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM AND WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. ROCKY RUSSIAN WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR US BEFORE THE FOUR AND A ME TOO AS WELL FOR FOSSIL FREE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH.

EMILY FEE REELING WITH% ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIAN UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS AND SUPPORT. THIRTY WELLS WE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA ADVANCED BIOFUELS ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. MY NAME IS TOM FOLKS I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE DIESEL TECHNOLOGY FORUM -- WE ARE UNABLE TO TAKE A POSITION YEA OR NAY ON THE BILL OUR BY LAWS PROHIBIT THAT BUT I DID WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF CONCERNS. THAT WE HAVE THE D. D. DTF IS MADE UP OF ENGINE MANUFACTURERS AUTOMAKERS DRUG MAKERS COMPONENTS. OF I'M GOING TO ASK IF YOU WOULD COME UP AFTER WE DO THE OPPOSITION AND THEN YOU'RE KIND OF A TWEENER. I'M TOTALLY BETWEEN HER AND I FIGURED WELL. THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD BOY CAN GET YOU'LL HAVE A WAIT TIME BUT WELL LET'S HAVE THE OPPOSITION COME TO THE DESK OKAY THING THEY CAN PRESENT THEIR MAJOR -- OPPOSITION THANK YOU MORNING MEMBERS -- MAYBE AT THE REFORM OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FIRST LET ME STATE THE CAL CHAMBER DOES NOT OBJECT TO THE INCLUSION OF TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL INCENTIVE FUNDING TO DEVELOP CLEAN DIESEL TECHNOLOGY. CUSTOMER DOES OPPOSE SB FORTY FOUR BECAUSE IT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND BECAUSE IT CREATES A MISCONCEPTION OF THE DIESEL FREIGHT INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. THE FACT SHEET ASSOCIATE WITH THIS BUILD FOCUSES ON THE TAGLINE OF DITCHING DIRTY DIESEL HOWEVER CALIFORNIA IN THE US LEADER IN UPGRADING DIESEL TECHNOLOGY. FIRST OF ALL CURRENT AIRPORT REGULATIONS REQUIRE THE UPGRADING OF DIESEL ENGINES TO REDUCE PARTICULATE MATTER. AND KNOCKS EMISSIONS TO NEAR ZERO EMISSIONS BY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN ADDITION SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN NEW TRUCKS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO MEET THE STANDARD RESULTING IN INCREASED EFFICIENCY. AND CONCURRENT DECREASING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CALIFORNIA'S ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE DIESEL. FUEL. WHICH REDUCES OVERALL FUEL CONSUMPTION. AND FURTHER CONTRIBUTES TO FURTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS OVERALL OVER OZONE PRECURSOR EMISSIONS FROM DIESEL ENGINES FROM THESE UPGRADES HAVE RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY NINETY EIGHT REDUCTION PERCENT REDUCTION OVER PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF DIESEL ENGINES. CHAMBERS PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL IN ITS GOALS BECAUSE IT WILL DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN HINDER CALIFORNIA'S COMPETITIVENESS WITH OTHER STATES. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A CALIFORNIA IS AT A SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE OVER ITS SISTER STATES IN THE AREAS OF SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT AND TRANSPORTATION OF GOODS. AND CONTINUE CHANGES TO THE DIESEL REGULATIONS OF BIG DISCOURAGING INVESTMENT IN NEW TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE OLDEST SWEETS IN THE NATION. FOR THESE REASONS CALIFORNIA CAL CHAMBER REPRESENTING FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEMBER BUSINESSES WHO DEPEND UPON RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION OF GOODS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NUMBER. THERE'S AN OPPOSITION. NO WELL KRAMER'S OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION BUT I DID WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL. OUR MEMBERS AND CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS DEPEND ON MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF DIESEL VEHICLES TO PLANT AND HARVEST AND BRING THEIR CROPS AND LIVESTOCK TO MARKET. AND WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE USE OF INCENTIVES THE CHALLENGE IS ONCE A REGULATION IS ADOPTED THOSE ASCENT INCENTIVES ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO HELP TRANSITION INTO NEWER CLEANER TECHNOLOGY. I AM WE APPRECIATE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OTHERS OFFICE -- TALKING THROUGH THESE CONCERNS WE APPRECIATE -- CONTINUING THAT CONVERSATION AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT AGRICULTURE ISN'T -- FURTHER DISADVANTAGE AND THAT WE STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE VEHICLES THAT WE NEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU THEN MR BETWEEN HER BACK. YES THANK YOU AGAIN TOM FORKS DIESEL TECHNOLOGY FORUM AGAIN WE REPRESENT MAKERS OF DIESEL ENGINES TRUCKS LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES COMPONENTS. IN LOW CARBON FUELS -- LIKE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION YEA OR NAY ON THE BILL IN FACT SOME OF THE THINGS THE BILLS TRYING TO DO -- MANY OF OUR MEMBERS SUPPORT MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY MEMBERS OF CAL START AS WELL THEY'RE SETTING UP SHOP THEY'RE WORKING ON ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY VEHICLES. IN MANY OF OUR MEMBERS IN FACT HE DIESEL TECHNOLOGY FORM ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER MEMBERS OF A COALITION WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE CLEAN AIR DIALOGUE PART OF SEEDS ON GOING -- DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY HAVE ISSUED A WHITE PAPER ABOUT LONG TERM FUNDING FROM THE FOR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION INTERPHALANGEAL PORT OF OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS -- NOW WITH REGARD TO THE FINDINGS OF THE BILL WE DO WANT TO LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT. IT THE THE FINDINGS WE FIND ALL MET A LOT OF THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE BY DIESEL ENGINES IN BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. THE CHAMBER HAS GONE DOWN A LOT OF THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO REPEAT THOSE THINGS I DID WANT TO JUST BRING BRING YOU TO THIS POINT. OLDER DIESEL ENGINES ARE THE PROBLEM AND EVERYBODY'S WORKING TO GET OLDER DIESEL ENGINES OFF THE ROAD. THE LAST TEN YEARS EVERY NEW DIESEL TRUCKS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE THAT 98% KNOCKS REDUCTION IN PM REDUCTION. I ALSO WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN SIXTY OLDER DIESEL TRUCKS TO PRODUCE THE SAME AMOUNT OF KNOX AND PM THAT ONE NEW DIESEL TRUCK MAKES. AND THEN LASTLY FROM THE HEALTH EFFECTS INSTITUTE I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT. GIVEN PROPER AFTER TREATMENT SYSTEMS THE HEALTH EFFECTS INSTITUTE WITH THIS ASUS STUDY FOUND THAT. PM FILTERS AND ESSIE OUR SYSTEMS GREATLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PM FOR MODERN DIESEL ENGINES AND THAT THE OVERALL TOXICITY OF EXHAUST FROM MODERN DIESEL ENGINES IS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. COMPARED WITH THE TOXICITY OF EMISSIONS FROM TRADITIONAL TECHNOLOGY DIESEL ENGINES THESE ARE THE OLDER DIESEL ENGINES WE ALL AGREE LET'S GET RID OF THEM. AND THEN FINALLY WITH REGARD TO THE ROLE THAT LOW CARBON DIESEL FUEL PLAYS WERE IT NOT FOR LOW CARBON DIESEL FUELS THE SUCCESS OF THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WOULD NOT BE WHAT IT IS TODAY. ON THE GASOLINE SIDE YOUR CAPPED AT 10% PLANS BECAUSE OF THE ETHANOL CONSTRAINTS WITH WITH GASOLINE ENGINES SO ALL THE GAMES FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH CARBON REDUCTION CREDITING CREDIT TRADING. AS CALM AS A RESULT OF LOW CARBON DIESEL ESPECIALLY. RE REALLY LOW CARBON RENEWABLE DIESEL SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OPTICS OF THE BILL DO NOT. OVERLOOK THE GREAT PROGRESS IN STRIDES THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS MADE. IT'S A IT'S A LEGACY INDUSTRY IT'S A HUNDRED YEARS OLD THE OF MANY OF OUR MAKERS ARE STILL THE ONES PRODUCING ELECTRIC VEHICLES ELECTRIC CLASSY TRACTORS IN MEDIUM DUTIES AS WELL. SO AGAIN JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE FROM A TECHNOLOGY STANDPOINT WE GET THE WHOLE PICTURE NOT JUST THE BAD STUFF THANK YOU. BY MATT RIEMANN WITHOUT MY TRUCKING ASSOCIATION ALSO IN A TWEENER NEUTRAL POSITION -- WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE STAKE HOLDERS FOR SOME PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS ON THE BILL. AS CALIFORNIA MOVES TOWARDS NEAR ZERO AND ZERO TECHNOLOGY WE ARE GONNA NEED A MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE IN ORDER TO HELP OUR FLEETS. BE ABLE TO PLAN YEARS OUT -- WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION MOVED FORWARD. I NEITHER A TWEENER NORA -- OPPOSITION I APOLOGIZED TO ME FOR BEING LATE A CHRISTMAS OUR ON BEHALF OF OVER ON FUELS IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. THANK YOU OKAY I OTHER FOLKS HONOREES CONCERNS. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. THE ITEMS NOW FOR THE COMMITTEE -- CENTER CASKEY. ARTHUR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING OUT THE 10% GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REQUIREMENT LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE GREENHOUSE GAS BUDGET AND STUFF -- TOO MY QUESTION IS ON THE REPORT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RELEASE WE GOT A REPORT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IT SORT OF UPDATE THESE MOBILE SOURCES. THEY IDENTIFY THINGS THEY TALKED ABOUT TRUCKS THERE'S A REPAIR BOARD HAS A STRATEGY ON TRUCKS -- WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE WERE YOU LOOKING FOR TO WITH THIS LEGISLATION ON AD? OTHER THAN THE REPORT COMING OUT IN JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHAT A TREAT YOUR MANSER THANK YOU SIR. S. B. FORTY FOUR YOU'VE HEARD SOME FOLKS -- IN OPPOSITION REFERRED OPTICS. MY PURPOSE IS SUBSTANTIVE IS NOT JUST OPTICS -- FI OFFENDED SOME WITH THE OPTICS APOLOGIES BUT YES CALIFORNIA IS DOING A LOT WITH LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND OTHERS. TO HELP. CLEAN UP THE THAT SECTOR BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE SECTOR OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY AND IF WE LOOK AT OUR INVESTMENTS. FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION FUND FOR EXAMPLE. IT IS FAR MORE HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARDS PASSENGER VEHICLES. NOW. I DON'T WANT TO REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT IN PASSENGER VEHICLES THEY ARE STILL THERE'S MORE PASSENGER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THEY ARE VERY POLLUTING. BUT IF I LOOK AT THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SECTOR. THEY ARE. THE OWNERS OF THOSE VEHICLES NOT IN ALL CASES BUT IN MANY CASES BECAUSE THERE -- THEY TAKE A LOT OF WHAT'S THE WORD THE ET THERE ARE IT'S HARD ON THOSE VEHICLES TO DO LONG HAUL AND ALL. THE OWNERSHIP CHANGES MORE FREQUENTLY. AND SO BY PUTTING MORE INVESTMENT TOWARDS OUR HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY. WE MAY. GET. MORE QUICKLY. ACTS A CLEANER FUEL AND THAT'S CLEANER AIR. AND I DON'T WANT US FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE BEHIND CHINA. HOW MANY ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS OR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES YOU KNOW MEDIUM DUTY DO YOU SEE ON CALIFORNIA ROADS NOT TOO MANY? GO TO CHINA. THERE ARE SEVEN TRUCKS. THEY ARE MANUFACTURING THEM THEY ARE. USING THEM. AND WHY SHOULD WE BEHIND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF MANUFACTURERS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO. WHAT I ATE THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EQUALLY? DIRECTING OUR REGULATIONS AND OUR RESOURCES TOWARDS THAT SECTOR WHICH INDEED HI GOODS MOVEMENT AREAS LIKE MY DISTRICT WHERE THE PORT OF OAKLAND IS WHERE THE PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH ARE. AND THEN THROUGH THE I TEND IT CETERA CORRIDORS HE WILL HELP US CLEAN ARE HERE AND GET THOSE CARBON REDUCTIONS [inaudible] I THINK. BECAUSE THERE'S TWO WAYS TO SKIN THIS CAT AS I SEE AS THE STAFF REPORT PARK. YOU HAVE. 90% OF IF YOU BOUGHT A NEW DIESEL TRUCK RIGHT NOW AND YOU TOOK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR PETER BELT OFF THE OFF THE ROAD THAT WOULD THAT WOULD DO THAT THAT'S AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM. GARCIA AT AB SIX SEVENTEEN HAS A LOT OF CARL MORE YEAR FUNDS IN THERE THAT GET SET THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION. PUTTING MONEY INTO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS BE THAT AS IT IS THAT'S A THAT'S ANOTHER STRATEGY. AS I AM AS I'M READING THIS YOUR ASKING THE AIRPORT TO TELL COME UP WITH A STRATEGY NOT THAT CHOOSE THIS STRATEGY -- THAT STRATEGY THE BOTH STRATEGIES RIGHT. YES AND AGAIN TO THE CHAIR SO. THE AIRPORT IS DOING A LOT. BUT WE STILL HAVE. THE DIRTIEST AIR OF ANYWHERE IN THE US. AND OUR SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US OUR WINDOW TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS VERY NARROW. IF YOU'RE THE OPERATOR OF A OF THESE LARGE DUTY THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES IT IS NOT INEXPENSIVE FOR YOU TO CONVERT. I WANT THE STATE TO GIVE MORE HELP TO THE OPERATORS TO CONVERT AND I WANT THAT CONVERSION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO BE IN A ZERO EMISSION. BUT I'M TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL ABOUT THAT. I HAVE NO PARTICULAR IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS ONE OR THAT ONE IT'S JUST IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS TRANSITION. LET SUPPORTED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ZERO EMISSION GIVEN. WHAT WE ARE THE CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING? OKAY AND BY THE WAY I I I I KNOW IT'S BEEN MISSED BEFORE I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE AUTHORS AGREED TO REMOVE THE CONTINUES CORPORATION. AND ACTUALLY I NEED TO MAKE A CLARIFICATION ON THE AMENDMENTS I SAID I WOULD TAKE THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS WHICH I AM HAPPY TO YOU. BUT THE ANALYSIS FIVE IN THE COMEDIAN I'VE TOGETHER BEEN WORKING THE ON THE ONES THAT WERE IN THE ANALYSIS OUR FIVE WE'RE STILL REFINING EXACTLY THE WORDING. IT'S THIS IS NOT JUST MY DESIRE TO MAKE IT -- TO TO REFINE IT BUT BOTH THE STAFF AND MY STAFF FOR WORKING SO THAT THE AMENDS THAT. I'M ACCEPTING IN THAT COME OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL REFLECT THOSE AGREED UPON CHANGES OKAY [inaudible] MASTER. WED ALWAYS TROUBLES ME WITH THESE WHICH SERVER GREETING CONCEPT AND CERTAINLY WE'RE ALL SEEKING OUT WHAT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY THE CONCEPT IS HERE A BETTER AIR CLEANER AIR. BUT WE GIVE IT TO CAR OUR AND YOU SAID YOU KNOW SENATOR SKINNER I HELP PLAN ON A FOR THE US YOU JUST MADE A COMMENT THAT WE HAVE THIS PLAN AND THAT PLAN YOU WANT IT. THIS PLANT THE BEST THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THESE THESE PROPOSALS THAT GOLD ARE SHOULD COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN TIME AFTER TIME AND MANY ON MONTHS THAT I'VE SERVED IN THIS COMMITTEE. WE COME UP WITH WITH LIKE A GREAT IDEA GIVEN TO OUR BUT IT NEVER COMES BACK IN FACT THERE'S BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE REALLY HAVE ANY MEASUREMENTS. THAT WE'RE GETTING WHERE WE WE WANT TO BE SO I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER. THAT GOING FORWARD AND I GUESS ANYONE OF THESE BILLS LET'S PUT THE LEGISLATURE BACK IN CHARGE BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY -- BUS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PUBLIC AND HOW IT IMPACTS THEM IN THE COMPLAINT THAT I RECEIVED FROM MY DISTRICT HAS THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN OUR KIND OF COME IN AND THINGS ARE KIND OF DECIDED BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE TOLD US. SO I AM GOING TO I'M NOT SUPPORTED TODAY BUT I KNOW I AM TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU DO AND YOUR PASSION TO DO THAT BUT I DO BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE. MORE OF A ROLE ON THESE BECAUSE THEN WE CAN MAKE IT MORE BIPARTISAN INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW THE REPUBLICANS DON'T LIKE IT IN THE DEMOCRATS LIKE IT IN SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN EVERYBODY OUT THERE'S CONFUSE LIKE. WHO LIKES IT AND WHO'S THAT HELPING AND I DO BELIEVE WE WANTED TO HELP EVERYBODY BECAUSE HE'S A VERY VERY SERIOUS ILLNESSES? THAT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN RELATE BACK TO THE POLLUTION THAT IS SOFT INCREASED OVER OVER THE YEARS SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF GOOD I MEAN WE CAN SEE THE MOUNTAINS FROM WHERE I LIVE IN IN THE OLD DAYS WE COULDN'T SO. THINGS ARE HAPPENING THAT ARE GOOD BUT LET'S PUT US -- LEASE BACK IN SOME OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT ON THINGS THAT REALLY AFFECT AN INDUSTRY WE'VE HEARD THAT A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. AREN'T WE KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ARE ARE CON THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS THE THE NEED. THE OPPORTUNITY ON TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT THEY NEED MORE INCENTIVES AND WE'RE THE ONES SO THAT'S WHERE I AM ON THE THANK YOU THE JOB [inaudible] A CENSORED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU SENATOR FOR QUICKNESS ISSUE FRONT CENTER AND TRY TO GET IT ORGANIZED. NOW TRY TO PUT A STRATEGY IT TOGETHER THAT'S GOING TO BE. TANGIBLE AND I DO AGREE THERE'S NEED FOR CONTINUED OVERSIGHT HERE BUT WE NEED TO BE VISIONARY. TOO AND SO ONE THING I WAS WONDERING I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM AMERICAN LONG POTENTIALLY ON THIS. THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMPONENT OF COURSE THERE'S A CLIMATE ELEMENT STORY BEHIND THAT AND WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T GIVEN OURSELVES I DON'T THINK MEANINGFUL METRICS FOR HOW WE WANT TO ATTACK THINGS LIKE CHILDHOOD ASTHMA. IN A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND SO. IN TERMS OF METRICS ARE CONSIDERATIONS. SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AS YOU GO FORWARD MEAN. THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF TRUANCY FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AMONG CHILDREN IS AS MUCH DO YOU IS THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE DATA I BELIEVE THE THE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION THE THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH HAS. DEFINITELY PUT THAT THAT OUT THERE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM ISM IN CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHT LAST MONTH. THAT EXACERBATE ASTHMA YOU'RE ABLE I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT TARGET IS RIGHT WE SAID EMISSIONS TARGETS BUT WHAT'S A TARGET FOR CUTTING THE RATES-CHILDHOOD ASTHMA AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. QUANTIFY THAT MEANINGFUL IMPACT BECAUSE IF WE DO THAT NOT ONLY WERE GONNA REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS AS WELL BUT EIGHTY EIGHT THERE'S ANY MORE KIDS IN A CLASSROOM SO I I JUST WONDER AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. AND I'D LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR BY THE WAY AND ADDED ON BUT HE'S TRYING TO WRESTLE WITH. SOME MEANINGFUL TARGET IN THAT WAY SO THAT WE DON'T GET TOO LOST IN THE ESOTERIC SERVE YOU KNOW. WE WENT YOU KNOW 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY RAIN AND THAT'S THAT THAT MEANT THAT MATTERS TO THAT SCIENCE BUT THERE'S ALSO PEOPLE'S LIVES SO. THERE IS SOME TO CONSIDER OF DO YOU WANT TO CUT CHILDHOOD AS MEN HALF BY ECSTASY THEY DO IT RIGHT. WHERE DOES THAT GO SO SO MANY CONSIDER? EITHER FOR THE QUESTION STOPS AND THAT THEY SENSE EMOTIONS. OKAY A SPIRIT SPIRIT OF EMOTION. WITH THAT THE AUTHOR MAY CLOSE -- THANK YOU APPRECIATE -- SENATOR -- STERN'S REFERENCES TO THE HEALTH PART. WHAT I OPENED WITH AND IT IS WHY I AM FOCUSING ON PETROLEUM BASED DIESEL BECAUSE OF THE PARTICULATE MATTER ASPECT OF IT? I DID TALK ABOUT OTHER EMISSIONS BUT IT IS THE PARTICULATE MATTER THAT IS THECONTRIBUTOR TO ASK ME NOW IT IS NOT THE ONLY CONTRIBUTED AS MUCH BUT IT'S SO SIGNIFICANT. AND IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT. AND IF WE NOT ONLY IF WE DO A BILL LIKE THIS BUT IF WE DIRECT THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS TOWARDS ASSISTING. OUR HEAVY DUTY OPERATORS CONVERT AS THEY PURCHASE THEIR FLEET CONVERTED THE RIGHT KIND OF VEHICLES. THEN -- WE CAN ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE AND I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND SO MOTION BY CENTER STERN IF YOU CAN COLOR ALL. ITEM NUMBER FIVE S. B.. FORTY FOUR THE MOTION IS D. PASSES AMENDED TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE.
