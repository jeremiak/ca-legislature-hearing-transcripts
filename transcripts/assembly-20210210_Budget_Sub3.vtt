00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:17.555
MAJOR AREA. AND REFORMING OUR

00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:18.656
STATE UNIVERSAL SERVICE

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:20.725
PROGRAMS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:22.160
SUPPORTING OUR LOCAL AND TRIBAL

00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:24.262
GOVERNMENTS. AND I'M GONNA GET

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:25.330
INTO A COUPLE OF

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:27.265
RECOMMENDATIONS AT A BROAD

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:30.468
LEVEL OF HOW WE HOPE TO WORK

00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:32.770
WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS. I

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:33.438
WANT TO START WITH A LITTLE BIT

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:36.074
OF BACKGROUND AND- RECOGNIZE

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.942
ALL THAT IS HAPPENING TODAY TO

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:39.577
TRY TO GET OUT THIS ISSUE BUT

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:43.281
UNFORTUNATELY TODAY. STILL

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:43.815
ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:45.850
CALIFORNIANS. WHO MAY HAVE

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:47.452
ACCESS TO SOME FORM OF

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:48.820
INFRASTRUCTURE COULD NOT AFFORD

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:50.488
IT AT THE LEVEL THAT THEY NEED

00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:54.492
IT. ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:57.428
TODAY HAVE AN ACCESS ISSUE. ONE

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.364
POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.466
DO SUBSCRIBE TO THE STATE'S LOW

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:03.768
INCOME SUBSIDY PROGRAM KNOWN AS

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.470
THE CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:07.038
THAT I KNOW YOU WILL BE

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:09.007
DISCUSSING FURTHER TODAY. THIS

00:30:09.073 --> 00:30:11.609
PROGRAM DOES NOT YET PROVIDE

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:13.711
SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO SUPPORT

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:14.913
THE BROADBAND NEEDS FOR

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:17.048
TELEWORK TELEHEALTH AND

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.616
DISTANCE LEARNING AND I'LL

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:19.851
TOUCH ON THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:22.554
REFORM IN THAT PROGRAM AND

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.355
ENHANCING IT LATER ON. IN

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:27.225
ADDITION THE STATE'S MAJOR ISPS

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:30.395
AT&amp;T FRONTIER COMCAST **** AND

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:35.033
CHARTER- ACCOUNT 495% OF THE

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:37.035
STATE'S BROADBAND CONNECTIONS.

00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:39.637
EACH OFFER HELLO REDUCE COSTS

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:42.373
PLAN HOWEVER CUMULATIVELY ALL

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.977
OF THEM ONLY OFFER THOSE PLANS

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:46.477
TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:48.346
SUBSCRIBERS SO THE GAP IS STILL

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:51.616
HUGE. EVERY DAY THESE COMPANIES

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:53.218
CONTINUE TO MAKE GREATER

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:54.052
COMMITMENTS AND I ACKNOWLEDGE

00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:56.421
THAT. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:58.723
UNENFORCEABLE. AND THEY

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.592
CURRENTLY ARE NOT MEETING NEEDS

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.026
ESPECIALLY OF ALL THE LOW

00:31:02.093 --> 00:31:05.396
INCOME CALIFORNIANS. IN

00:31:05.463 --> 00:31:06.898
NOVEMBER I ALSO WANT TO

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:07.932
RECOGNIZE THE CONGRESSIONAL

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:09.834
ACTION INCLUDED AN EMERGENCY

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:11.703
BROADBAND BENEFIT THAT WOULD

00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:13.104
INCREASE AT THAT WOULD PROVIDE

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:14.906
A SUBSIDY OF FIFTY DOLLARS A

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:16.674
MONTH. BUT IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:18.943
MONTHS AT ALL YOU WANT TO

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.411
RECOGNIZE IT DOES PROVIDE

00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:21.546
DOUBLE WHAT THE LIFELINE

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:23.481
PROGRAM CURRENTLY DOES FOR THE

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:26.818
VOICE AND VOICE SERVICES. IT'S

00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:28.486
ONLY A ONE TIME FUNDING PROGRAM.

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:29.921
SO THERE'S POTENTIAL THERE BUT

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:32.457
IT IS. JUST A SOMEWHAT OF A

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:36.327
PILOT PROGRAM. IN ADDITION-

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:37.662
CALIFORNIA DID RECEIVE SOME OF

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.864
THE FEDERAL MONEY SIX HUNDRED

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:40.431
NINETY FIVE MILLION OF THE

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:43.001
FC'S RULES DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.370
FUN. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:47.572
RECEIVED A HIGH AMOUNT OF LOW

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:49.807
QUALITY PROJECTS THAT WILL

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:51.676
LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.378
THE SERVICE THAT WE NEED NOW WE

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:55.880
ARE WORKING ON MAKING THOSE-

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:58.750
PROPOSALS AS BEST AS THEY CAN.

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:00.351
BUT NOT WHAT WE WANTED TO SEE.

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:01.519
SO WHY ARE THESE MEASURES

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:04.956
WORKING. THE KEY HERE TO REALLY

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:06.991
TAKE HOME IS BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:09.661
NOT ENFORCEABLE. UNLIKE OTHER

00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:12.096
SERVICES WATER ELECTRICITY AND

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:14.365
GAS UTILITY SERVICES BROADBAND

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:16.768
SERVICE IS NOT REGULATED AS IN

00:32:16.834 --> 00:32:19.504
A SPECIAL SERVICE THAT IT IS.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.973
EITHER BY US AT THE STATE LEVEL

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.008
NOR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:25.343
MANNER IN WHICH HE READILY

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.478
BROADBAND IS THE FOUNDATIONAL

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:30.214
CHANGE THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO

00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:32.216
ATTAIN UNIVERSAL SERVICE

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:34.319
RELIABLE SERVICE AND AFFORDABLE

00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:37.622
SERVICE. HISTORICALLY THE STATE

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:39.290
DESIGNATED TELECOMMUNICATION

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:41.859
PROVIDERS AS A SERVICE WITH THE

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:43.728
SERVICE TERRITORY AND WE USED

00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.396
AND WE MANDATED THAT PROVIDERS

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:47.198
SERVE EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THEIR

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:49.300
SERVICE TERRITORY THIS IS FOR

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:51.035
THE VOICE SERVICE. THAT

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.403
REQUIREMENT IS CALLED THE

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.405
KERRIER OF LAST RESORT THAT'S

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:55.673
HOW WE WERE ABLE TO MANDATE

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.608
RELIABLE TELEPHONE SERVICE FOR

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:59.944
ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE FOR

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:01.813
EVERY CALIFORNIAN FOR THE LAST

00:33:01.879 --> 00:33:04.916
CENTURY. THE STATE COUPLE THOSE

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.617
REQUIRED FOR THOSE REQUIREMENTS

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:08.920
ON THE CARRIERS WITH A SUBSIDY

00:33:08.986 --> 00:33:10.888
TO OFFSET THE COST TO EVERYONE.

00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:12.357
ESPECIALLY IN THOSE HIGH COST

00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:14.292
AREAS IN RURAL SPARSELY

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:16.094
POPULATED DIFFICULT TO SERVE

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.229
AREAS. THESE PROGRAMS STILL

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.298
EXIST TODAY AND ARE CALLED THE

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:23.701
HIGH COST FUND PROGRAMS THERE'S

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:25.770
A NEED TO BE. HOWEVER THE V.

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:28.439
FINE WHICH IS THE PRIMARY ONE

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:30.641
ONLY SUBSIDIZES VOICE SERVICE

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.810
AND OF COURSE I WILL TALK ABOUT

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:33.344
HOW THAT FUND NEEDS TO BE

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:37.081
UPDATED. WE ALSO SUBSIDIZE THE

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:38.716
CARRIERS FOR PROVIDING A

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:40.685
DISCOUNT TO LOW INCOME BOYS

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:43.087
SERVICES OUT AS WE KNOW THROUGH

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:44.956
THE LIFELINE PROGRAM AND THAT

00:33:45.022 --> 00:33:47.024
IS AGAIN A PROGRAM THAT NEEDS

00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:49.627
TO BE UPDATED FOR BROADBAND.

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:51.329
THIS POLICY REGION CURRENTLY

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:53.398
DOESN'T EXIST FOR BROADBAND

00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:55.566
INSTEAD WE HAVE AN UNREGULATED

00:33:55.633 --> 00:33:58.002
COMMUNICATIONS MARKET. WE NEED

00:33:58.069 --> 00:33:59.604
TO WORK TOGETHER TO ESTABLISH

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.005
THESE BASIC REQUIREMENTS ON

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:03.674
ISPS THAT THEY SERVE EVERYONE

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:04.609
AND THAT THEY PROVIDE

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:05.977
AFFORDABLE SERVICE TO THE MOST

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:09.080
VULNERABLE. WE SHOULD ALSO

00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:11.015
CONCURRENTLY ACKNOWLEDGE THESE

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:13.351
ARE COSTS NEED TO BE OFFSET AND

00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:15.286
UPDATE OUR HIGH COST FUND IN

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:17.989
OUR LIFELINE PROGRAM TO ASSIST

00:34:18.055 --> 00:34:20.291
IN COVERING THOSE COSTS. WHEN I

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:21.959
TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR ACT

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:23.127
THAT'S RELEVANT FOR MAKING

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:25.129
THESE CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:27.432
THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:30.835
VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF TWO

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:31.469
THOUSAND SIX IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:33.738
DIFFICULT. IT WAS ONE OF THE

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:36.040
KEY ACTS THAT DEREGULATED THE

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:36.541
COMMUNICATIONS MARKET IN

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:39.310
CALIFORNIA. HIGHER TO DISCUSS

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:41.078
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE THEIR

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:42.847
LICENSING AUTHORITY TO ENSURE

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.615
THAT CARRIERS WERE PROVIDING

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:46.617
QUALITY SERVICE AFFORDABLE

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:48.152
OFFERINGS AND THAT THESE

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.087
COMPANIES WERE SERVING THE

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:52.590
ENTIRE COMMUNITY. DIFFICULT WAS

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:55.293
REPLACED I REPLACED THIS LOCAL

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.294
CONSTRUCT WITH A STATEWIDE

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.896
STRUCTURE WHERE NOW THE PC

00:34:58.963 --> 00:35:00.832
PROVIDES A FRANCHISE LICENSE

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.667
AND WE HAVE VERY LITTLE

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:05.369
OVERSIGHT. THE NETWORK BUILD

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:07.205
OUT AND LOW INCOME REQUIREMENTS

00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:09.841
FROM THE ACT HAVE NOT BEEN

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:12.543
UPDATED IN TEN YEARS. THERE'S

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.346
BEEN RECENT STUDIES BY U. S. C.

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:17.682
GREEN LINING NDA AND OTHERS

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:19.484
INCLUDING SOME OF OUR OWN THAT

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.618
HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS HAS

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:23.955
RESULTED IN REDLINING IN LOW

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:25.990
INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:29.227
THE ACT MAKES- OVERSIGHT AND

00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:31.062
ENFORCEMENT OF THESE ISSUES

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:33.264
IMPOSSIBLE IT NEEDS TO BE

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.699
UPDATED TO PROVIDE THE

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:37.001
APPROPRIATE. OF MEASURES FOR

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:39.403
SERVICE AND ENFORCEMENT

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.406
MECHANISMS. TODAY THERE HAS

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:43.808
BEEN NO ENFORCEMENT ACTION

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:46.511
UNDER THE ACT. I CAN TELL YOU

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:48.713
PERSONALLY EVERY WEEK I

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:50.214
RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS FROM

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:53.117
COMMUNITIES COUNCILMEMBERS

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:56.153
SUPERVISORS. COOPER ATTENDANCES

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.555
SUPERINTENDENTS HAVE BEEN DOING

00:35:57.622 --> 00:35:59.557
INCREDIBLE WORK. THERE'S

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:00.758
COMMUNITIES LIKE ON THE WEST

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.460
SIDE OF FRESNO COMMUNICABLE

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:04.495
VIOLA FOR THEIR SERVICE ON ONE

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:06.197
SIDE HISTORY BUT NOT THE OTHER

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:07.965
WE ALL HEARD OF THE YOUNG WOMEN

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:09.800
IN SALINAS THE YOUNG CHILDREN

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:12.036
IN SALINAS THAT LACKED ACCESS

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:14.272
TO AFFORDABLE SERVICE. JUST

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:16.707
YESTERDAY I RECEIVED A CALL A

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:19.143
EMAIL FROM A MOBILE HOME PARK

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.979
IN GILROY. WHOSE CABLE COMPANY

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:22.947
WAS STARTING TO DISCONNECT

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:25.316
THEM. NOT BECAUSE OF LACK OF

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:26.250
PAYMENT BUT BECAUSE THEY NO

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:28.085
LONGER WERE PAYING FOR THE

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:30.321
VIDEO SERVICE. ALL OF THESE

00:36:30.388 --> 00:36:32.723
ISSUES THEY'RE ALL UNIQUE THEY

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.926
ALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO. OF BE

00:36:34.992 --> 00:36:37.128
REMEDIED WITH SOME REGULATORY

00:36:37.194 --> 00:36:41.165
CONSTRUCT. AND BY THE WAY I

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:44.168
WOULD SAY MOST NOT ALL THAT I

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:46.537
WOULD SAY- YOU KNOW A LOT OF

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.539
THESE ISSUES HAVE NOTHING TO DO

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.441
WITH A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:52.143
THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THE LACK

00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:55.146
OF REGULATION. SO THE ACT NEEDS

00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:56.581
TO BE UPDATED TO ENSURE THAT

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:57.882
THE LARGEST INTERNET SERVICE

00:36:57.949 --> 00:36:59.550
PROVIDERS ARE PROVIDING

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:00.885
INTERNET SERVICES TO ALL

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.954
NEIGHBORHOODS IN COMMUNITIES.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.122
AND AFFORDABLE PLANS TO LOW

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:07.625
INCOME CALIFORNIANS. BY THE WAY

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:08.693
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE LOOKING

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:10.695
OUT OUR CONSTRUCTS THE NEW YORK

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:11.929
NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR GOVERNOR

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:13.598
CUOMO JUST ANNOUNCED THAT HE

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:16.233
WILL PROPOSE- A PERSON NATION

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.169
REQUIREMENT THROUGH LEGISLATION

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:20.404
REQUIRING ISPS TO OFFER AN

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.239
AFFORDABLE FIFTEEN DOLLAR MONTH

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:24.842
PLAN FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:27.845
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. OKAY SO

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:29.947
I THINK YOU GOT THE MESSAGE ON

00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:32.750
THE NEED FOR REGULATION HERE-

00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:34.452
THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:36.387
PIECE TO THE PUZZLE IS

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:38.255
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE NEED TO

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:39.757
CONSIDER OUR INVESTMENT IN

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:41.359
INFRASTRUCTURE HAS SOMETHING

00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:44.729
THAT IS CONTINUOUS AND WILL BE

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:46.530
LIKE ANY OTHER OUR SYSTEM OF

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:48.633
UTILITY SERVICE THAT NEEDS

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:50.635
CONSTANT REINVESTMENT. M.

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:53.137
BROADBAND IS NO DIFFERENT.

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.405
HERE'S SOME OF THE NUMBERS FOR

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.240
THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE

00:37:56.307 --> 00:37:59.443
THERE ARE STILL SIX HUNDRED AND

00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.910
SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:00.845
HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE NOT

00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:03.414
CONNECTED CALIFORNIA AND THAT

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:05.416
IS THE LARGEST POPULATION THAN

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:06.917
ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:09.887
UNFORTUNATELY. 33% A RURAL

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:12.957
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE HAVE NO

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:15.259
HIGH SPEED BROADBAND. TRIBAL

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:16.861
LANDS ARE VERY DEEPLY

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:18.462
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:20.631
WERE 24% OF THEIR HOMES ARE

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:23.801
WITHOUT ACCESS. THE CALIFORNIA

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:27.138
ADVANCED SERVICES FUND CSF IS

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:28.406
THE MOST CRITICAL STATE

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:30.341
INFRASTRUCTURE FUND AND WE

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:31.909
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.144
WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.780
EXTENDING THAT PROGRAM IN

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:38.249
MAKING IT EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL.

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:40.418
SINCE IT A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:42.553
WHEN IT BEGAN THE PROGRAM HAS

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.655
FUNDED SEVENTY SEVEN PROJECTS

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:48.359
WHICH HAVE PROVIDED SERVICE TO

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:48.959
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND

00:38:49.026 --> 00:38:52.096
HOUSEHOLDS. TODAY WE ARE IN A

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.432
CURRENT ROUND OF FUNDING ANY IS

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:57.401
OVER SUBSCRIBED WE HAVE A TOTAL

00:38:57.468 --> 00:38:59.303
OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.638
MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:03.441
PROJECT REQUESTS AND WE HAVE A

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:05.609
TO APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:09.146
MILLION REMAINING. WE'VE

00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:11.015
CONDUCTED AN INITIAL COST

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:12.216
ASSESSMENT THAT DIRECTOR

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:14.018
OSBORNE COULD GET INTO MUCH

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.653
MORE DETAIL ON IT WHAT IF

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.022
THERE'S INTERESTS. BUT THE COST

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:19.390
RANGES FOR SERVING THE STATE

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:21.192
ARE BETWEEN SIX TO SEVEN

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:22.993
BILLION AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THE

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.662
CURRENT CASF INFRASTRUCTURE

00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:27.031
FUND DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:29.834
RESOURCES FOR THAT. AND AGAIN

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.836
WE WANT TO SEE THIS AS THE

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:32.770
INJECTION OF FUNDING THAT IS

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:35.406
NEEDED TODAY BUT IT WILL BE A

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:35.840
CONTINUOUS NEED FOR

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:39.677
REINVESTMENT. I WANT TO POINT

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:41.212
OUT THAT SOME OF THE EXCELLENT

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:44.014
ANALYSIS IN THE STAFF OUR OUR

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:47.785
REPORT. AS YOU CONTINUE TO

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.153
EXAMINE THE NEED FOR EXTENDING

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.155
THE PROGRAM WE REALLY DO WANT

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:52.757
TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE FOR

00:39:52.823 --> 00:39:54.825
BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF TRIBAL

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.927
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY HAVE

00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:59.230
SUCH A PIVOTAL ROLE TO PLAY IN

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:01.699
CLOSING THIS DIVIDE. THERE IS A

00:40:01.766 --> 00:40:04.468
NEED FOR GREATER CAPACITY

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:07.171
FUNDING FOR THOSE LOW- IN AND

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.206
TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE WHAT

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.608
WE HAVE SEEN UNFORTUNATELY THE

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:13.277
PROGRAM'S HISTORY IS CHRONIC

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:15.312
CHRONICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS I

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:16.714
CAN'T FORGET TO MENTION

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.449
COMMUNITIES LIKE LOST HILLS.

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:20.184
NEVER GET AN APPLICATION

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.685
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT REALLY A

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.854
MARKET INCENTIVE FOR THEM T

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.122
GET SERVICE OF THE CARRIERS

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:27.124
DON'T COME IN WITH APPLICATIONS

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:28.859
WE NEED THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:30.327
AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD

00:40:30.394 --> 00:40:31.428
KNOW THESE AREAS ARE

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:33.464
CHRONICALLY UNDERSERVED TO HAVE

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:35.900
THE CAPACITY TO FINALLY APPLY.

00:40:35.966 --> 00:40:38.002
TO SERVE FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:40.137
WE ALSO NEED TO ELIMINATE

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:42.673
BARRIERS FOR EXPEDITING THESE-

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.008
BUILDS THIS CONSTRUCTION

00:40:44.074 --> 00:40:45.943
BUILDS. BY ELIMINATING A

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.511
PRACTICES THAT HAVEN'T HAPPENED

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.747
IN PREVIOUS YEARS LIKE CARVE

00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:52.449
OUTS TO INCUMBENTS OR PROVIDING

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:53.217
COMMENTS A RIGHT OF FIRST

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:55.920
REFUSAL. THIS HASN'T WORKED IN

00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:57.354
THE LAST REAUTHORIZATION OF THE

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:59.356
CASF PROGRAM THERE WAS BRITNEY

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:00.391
SENSUALLY A CARVE OUT FOR

00:41:00.457 --> 00:41:02.693
FRONTIER NAY T. AND T. FOR TWO

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.262
YEARS. AND EIGHTEEN T. NEVER

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:07.464
APPLIED FOR ONE DOLLAR SO.

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:09.233
AREAS LIKE JUST NORTH OF

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.236
PARADISE NEVER WE'RE WAITING

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:17.942
FOR TWO YEARS ASKING AT&amp;T MONTH.

00:41:18.008 --> 00:41:18.475
AFTER MONTH ARE YOU GONNA

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:19.777
SERVICE OR NOT. AND THEY DO IT.

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:20.878
SO PLEASE DON'T THAT AGAIN HI

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:22.046
TO PROVIDE THAT SORT OF

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:26.417
CONSTRUCT. AND FINALLY CONSIDER

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:29.620
THAT THESE ARE THESE FUNDS AS I

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:30.120
MENTIONED WILL BE NEEDED

00:41:30.187 --> 00:41:34.158
CONTINUOUSLY. I ALSO WANT TO

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.993
BRING- THE FINAL ISSUE THAT WAS

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:36.760
REALLY OUTLINED IN THE

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:39.096
GOVERNOR'S- EIGHT PAGES WHICH

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:41.131
IS THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:42.800
GOVERNMENT AND REALLY TALK

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:43.868
ABOUT SOME OF THE EXCITING

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.502
MODELS THAT ARE OCCURRING BOTH

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:46.470
IN OUR STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:48.405
NATION. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:51.041
BROADBAND IS A LOCAL ISSUE

00:41:51.108 --> 00:41:52.877
TRIBAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:55.546
HAVE THE ABILITY AND TOOLS TO

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:57.481
BUILD BY KNOWING THE NEEDS BUT

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.416
ALSO BY EXPEDITING PERMITTING

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:00.351
AND USING THEIR PLANNING

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.119
AUTHORITIES AND OTHER

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:04.788
INCENTIVES THAT THEY CAN BUNDLE

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:06.156
TOGETHER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:42:06.223 --> 00:42:07.758
IDEALLY THEY COULD ALSO BUILD

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:09.059
THEIR OWN FOUNDATIONAL

00:42:09.126 --> 00:42:10.628
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT COULD BE

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:12.196
USED TO BRING IN EVEN MORE

00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:14.732
COMPETITION. AS WE KNOW LOCAL

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:16.400
GOVERNMENTS ARE MORE DRIVEN TO

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:17.568
SEE SUCCESS IN THEIR ENTIRE

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:19.837
COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE HIGH

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:22.206
QUALITY SERVICE AND THEY SEE

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:23.374
THAT DIRECT CONNECTION WITH

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.509
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:27.378
SOME. EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:29.380
KNOW OF TODAY CORE FUNCTIONS

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:32.249
EDUCATION HEALTH CARE. THERE'S

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:32.950
MANY EXAMPLES BUT LET ME TELL

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:35.252
YOU ABOUT A FEW IN UTAH THERE'S

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:37.588
A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY CALLED

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:40.090
UTAH TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPEN

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:42.359
INFRASTRUCTURE AGENCY. OR

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:44.929
UTOPIA. THEY BUILT AND THEN

00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:46.897
THERE CONTINUOUSLY BUILDING AN

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:50.034
OPEN ACCESS FIBRE NETWORK THAT

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.068
PROVIDE SERVICE TO ELEVEN

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:53.337
CITIES. AND THEY DO SO WITH

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.805
ACTUALLY A BONDING MECHANISM

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:56.740
THAT PROVIDES THAT IS BASED ON

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:58.642
VERY LITTLE A PUBLIC FINANCIAL

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.144
SUPPORT THEY'RE ABLE TO USE

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:01.912
THEIR REVENUE BASE. BUT THEIR

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:04.114
MODEL ESSENTIALLY IS THAT THE

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:05.683
PUBLIC HAS FUNDED THIS

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:07.217
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN THE

00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:09.253
ALLOW CARRIERS TO COMPETE ON

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.822
TOP OF IT FOR CUSTOMERS

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:14.358
ACCOUNTS. MANY CITIES HAVE ALSO

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:16.226
DEVELOP MASTER PLANS TO

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:17.628
STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING OF

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:19.296
FIVE G. SMALL CELLS AND FIBER

00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:21.699
OPTIC CABLES. THIS ENABLES

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:23.901
SMART CITY SOLUTIONS SMART

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.602
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES SMART

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:27.271
STREETLIGHTS INTELLIGENT

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:29.573
TRAFFIC SIGNAL SYSTEMS SMALL

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.742
CELLS AND PUBLIC WIFI. ALL OF

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.078
THESE ARE MORE REASONS TO BUILD

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:34.545
THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL

00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:36.914
GOVERNMENT. AND FINALLY BUT NOT

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:38.382
JUST LAST YEAR I WAS ABLE TO

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:40.150
PARTICIPATE IN A VIRTUAL RIBBON

00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:43.153
CUTTING OF THE SOUTH BAY CITIES

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.122
CAPS COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS.

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:47.524
FIBER NETWORK THE BAY BUILT ON

00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:50.227
THEY USED A COUPLE OF THE USED

00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:51.695
RACE COMMUNICATIONS IN AMERICAN

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:54.064
DARK FIBER BUT- THEY COMPLETED

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:55.866
A REGIONAL MUNICIPAL BROADBAND

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:59.069
NETWORK THAT SERVES UP FOR

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:00.337
FIFTEEN OF THE CITIES. IN THE

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:02.239
LOS ANGELES SOUTH BAY REGION

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:04.241
AND THEY HAVE OBVIOUSLY A

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:06.510
VISION TO DO MORE WITH. SO

THAT'S ONE. ISSUE TO CONSIDER I

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:20.168
AN IMPORTANT. PART OF MAKING

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.603
SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:24.339
ACCESS TO OUR PHONE AND

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:26.608
INTERNET UT ACTUALLY MAKING

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:27.309
SURE THAT LOW INCOME

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:29.077
CALIFORNIANS HAVE A PHONE IN

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.779
THEIR HAND AND THAT THAT PHONE

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.647
HAS ACCESS TO DATA. THAT THEY

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:34.115
CAN USE IS ANOTHER CRITICAL

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:35.784
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE WE WOULD

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.786
ALSO SUGGEST THAT IN PREVIOUS

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:40.555
YEARS LIFELINE PROVIDERS HAD

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:42.324
DONE A GOOD JOB OF OUR

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.458
INVOLVEMENT AND OUTREACH

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:46.461
EFFORTS AT THAT THE WAY THAT-

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:48.163
REIMBURSEMENT HOT STOCKCHARTS

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:50.398
THE LIFELINE PROVIDER HAVE BEEN

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:51.599
ALTERED IN RECENT YEARS. HAS

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.368
CREATED DISINCENTIVES FOR

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.570
LIFELINE PROVIDERS THEMSELVES

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.405
TO CONTINUE DOING THAT WORK AND

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:58.306
THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:00.175
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT LIKE

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:01.876
FIND INVOLVEMENT IS DOWN. WE

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:04.212
WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:06.548
TO CONSIDER THE- SURPLUS THAT

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:14.589
WILL ULTIMATELY. BE AVAILABLE

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:15.690
IN THE EARMARKED FOR BY BUDGET

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:16.424

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:20.195
OPTIONS FOR. LIFELINE PER. IN

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:23.331
REVENGE. AND REDOING THEIR AT

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:25.166

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:28.069
FOR A STUDY FROM- STOCKS. I

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:28.970
COULD COME IN I AT THE VERY END

01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:30.271
THIS YEAR BUT A WHOLE YEAR GONE

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:32.407
BY ISSUE TO WAIT TO. THAT BUT

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:34.809
