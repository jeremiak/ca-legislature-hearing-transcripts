for having all of us today

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.256
he timely has we know we all

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:31.758
got a little wake up call on

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:33.760
July fourth and July fifth with

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.461
-- the ridge crest earthquake

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.930
our office was a very active

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:39.699
in that response and continues

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.701
to be in the recovery as well

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:44.504
I'd like to start off pretty

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.773
basic -- kind of emergency

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.408
management one oh one -- with

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:50.743
the the number one tenant

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.545
and emergency management all

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:54.580
disasters are local they start

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.215
and the end at the local level

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:58.484
the state's here to supplement

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.086
to support how we can but

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.087
if the local government can

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.456
take care of it fantastic

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:04.957
and as you can see with this

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:07.226
slide here there's the five

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:09.061
different levels of response

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.130
as we do it in the state and

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.698
it's the standardized emergency

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.934
management system or Sam's

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:16.969
and this is the cornerstone

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:18.437
of our response and recovery

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:19.839
operations in the state

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.074
again we're in the city of

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.343
Ontario today if there were

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.312
an earthquake and the field

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.647
first responders can handle

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.715
it that's great if they need

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.617
additional support that's one

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.052
local government would step in

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.720
the city of Ontario they were

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:36.088
perhaps open their emergency

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:38.090
operations center provide more

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:39.525
specific portent resources

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:41.027
to our first responders out

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:43.162
in the field if it's bigger

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:44.497
than that may need additional

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.032
support they would go to the

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.301
county the operational area

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.436
-- the county has oversight

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:51.871
of all local jurisdictions

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:53.306
all special districts within

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:55.341
those county lines and if it's

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.809
bigger than that that's where

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:58.211
my office would step in and

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.879
Los Alameda stats are southern

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:02.048
California region were a big

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:04.183
region eleven counties and

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.718
if we need more support we

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:07.220
go on up to Sacramento at the

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.188
state operations center and

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.890
if it's truly catastrophic

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.326
then we as the state would ask

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.061
federal government and FEMA

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.229
-- for support and they've

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.531
been very close partners of

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.166
us in the past several years

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:23.135
and and additionally all

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:24.770
jurisdictions must use the

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:26.639
structure it's been not that a

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:28.841
construct that came about after

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:30.543
the nineteen ninety one Oakland

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.678
hills fire this kind adds more

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:34.447
structure to the chaos that use

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:36.315
the an incident command system

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:38.451
to manage incidents and it works

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.086
really well Californian and in

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:41.988
fact it was a it's a national

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.689
model and we're proud of it

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.327
so the state of California

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:49.695
emergency plan this is our

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:51.764
blueprint of how we do business

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:54.133
-- it's a great read -- I

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.635
encourage you to do it as well

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:56.836
as the public there's a lot of

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.905
fantastic information in there

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.240
again it's got a few parts to

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.843
it -- it defines our roles

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.611
and responsibilities who does

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:07.747
what in an emergency what state

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.749
agency is responsible for what

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.984
function it also spells out

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.519
responsibilities for local

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:16.455
governments -- and as well

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:18.457
addresses specific hazards

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:19.892
and here in California as you

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:22.461
can -- we basically have

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:24.463
any any hazard imaginable I mean

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.299
we we run the gamut we've got

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.567
volcanic hazards earthquakes

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:31.504
pandemic agricultural disasters

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:34.106
tsunami terrorism at cetera

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:36.275
etcetera this plan is designed

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.044
to address all hazards

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:40.813
also in this plan you can

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.882
find information on our mutual

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:44.283
aid system in California

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:46.686
we do it very very well in

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.387
in California -- the master

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:49.588
mutual aid agreement was

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:51.757
signed in nineteen fifty our

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.125
law enforcement agencies in

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:55.428
our fire agencies -- do mutual

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:56.729
aid I think better than anyone

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:57.897
and we're we're really lucky

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.699
to have that system in place

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:02.868
we also do alert and

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.037
warning communications and

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:06.505
cover all phases of emergency

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:08.074
management from preparedness

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.943
mitigation response and recovery

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:14.580
it also outlines how do local

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:15.948
government requests those

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:17.616
resources again I'll I'll take

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:19.418
you back to that Sam slide

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.320
go up that chain and when

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.356
when the government the state

00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:24.790
whoever federal government

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:26.592
we want to fill gaps we want

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.294
to fill those needs use the

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:30.129
structure it's worked very well

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.567
now this is a big endeavor of

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:35.935
ours that we're doing right

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:37.670
now this is a rewrite of the

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:39.405
southern California catastrophic

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.907
earthquake plan we wrote this

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:43.776
plan in two thousand eleven

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:45.211
and I've spent the last two

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:48.314
years -- refining this document

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.383
-- we've had over twelve

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:51.650
workshops here in southern

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:53.552
California and a litany of

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:55.187
other working groups in meetings

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.355
all throughout the state

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.892
the plan covers and plans for

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:01.527
twenty one major earthquake

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:03.262
faults in southern California

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.498
-- but what we've decided to

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:07.767
do is basically plan for the

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.635
worst case scenario we plan

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:11.771
for that big the big one the

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.339
seven point eight earthquake

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:14.673
on the southern San Andreas

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.109
fault starting at the Salton sea

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.478
rupturing all the way up through

00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:21.347
LA county and northwards even

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:23.649
answer Kern affecting twelve

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:25.484
counties this is a region wide

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:27.987
event and the numbers themselves

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:29.722
are pretty overwhelming -- we

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:31.857
front statistical models and a

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:34.026
scenario like this we could see

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:37.163
we could see twelve thousand

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:38.764
deaths over a hundred and

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:40.900
seventy five thousand injuries

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.903
buildings destroyed urban

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:46.172
fires going on infrastructure

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:48.641
down utilities down and an

00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:49.875
estimate of two hundred and

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:51.277
thirty two billion dollars

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:53.446
in damage we wanted to plan

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:55.214
for the worst so we can see

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.715
what contingencies we have in

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:59.685
place locally the state level

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.120
and the federal level to deal

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:02.955
with consequences like this

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:04.557
and we're grateful for FEMA

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:05.891
they've been great partners

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.927
-- in this planning process

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.298
bear with me on the side I know

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:13.933
there's a lot of words but let

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:15.468
me let me take you through it

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:18.337
-- I want to first talk

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:19.705
about some of our partners in

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.907
contributors to the plan --

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:24.477
again FEMA -- department

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:25.978
of defense department of

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:27.113
transportation and other

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:28.714
federal agencies were all major

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.083
players in this -- the state

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:32.985
all state agencies played a role

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:35.521
in this -- local governments

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.289
all twelve affected counties

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:38.858
were key contributors to this

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:41.594
plan -- tribal governments

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.796
nonprofits and also the private

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.297
sector this is a whole community

00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:46.966
approach we need everybody's

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:48.634
input we all have a vested

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:51.303
interest in this and this plan

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:54.573
FX nineteen million people

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.641
and we're all in this one

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.344
together so at the end

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.378
of the day we're gonna have a

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.447
really good products -- were

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:02.681
about eighty percent done

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.917
with the project -- we want

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:07.219
to socialize this plan as well

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:08.988
as test an exercise the plan

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:10.489
as well -- that's gonna happen

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.758
this upcoming year there

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.927
were two side projects that

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:17.730
coincided with this process --

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.299
we asked all twelve counties

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:22.501
to provide us with their fuel

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.570
burn rates what are your public

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.239
safety agencies use monthly

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:29.542
for fuel and we got a lot

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:31.377
of this information fuel they

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:33.112
say could be the Achilles heel

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:34.280
of this response there will

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:36.549
be a fuel shortage knowing

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:38.851
that information today is

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:40.853
really really beneficial should

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.821
something happen another side

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:44.557
project is come out of this is

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:46.992
logistical staging areas right

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:48.527
now we've done several county

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:49.828
is already were continuing

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:51.230
to do more we want to hit all

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:53.999
twelve here identifying key

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.734
points of distribution where we

00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:57.803
can ship food water commodity

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.439
sheltering supplies so we now

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.408
can fifty three five three foot

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:04.009
trucks get in and out of this

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:05.978
area can we land helicopters

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:07.980
here can we land fixed wing

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:10.249
aircraft here so this knowledge

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:12.418
beforehand it will be absolutely

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:14.520
essential come come day get day

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:17.056
a game day and

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:18.824
-- the product will be good but

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:20.426
I want to just also emphasize

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:22.428
how important the process was

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:23.829
just going through this we

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:25.564
learn something every time we

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:27.333
did one of these workshops and

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.867
the more data we collected the

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:31.704
stronger we we will all be --

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:34.039
second bullet I want to focus

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:35.574
on I know it's tough to read

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.576
but this will make or break

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:40.145
your response the last

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:41.547
let's say three to four years

00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:43.115
in California with our wire

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:44.850
well wild fires debris flow

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.485
mud slides said truly been

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.854
catastrophic so what has

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:51.257
helped us manage this is the

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:53.025
multi agency coordination

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.727
concept and the task force

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.895
concept so I'll give you a

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:58.530
couple examples for the wild

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:00.399
fires there's there's key

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:02.401
problem areas after any type

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:04.169
of disaster I column themes

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:05.738
you can call on tax task

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:07.873
forces mac groups what have you

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:10.442
so some of these commonalities

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:11.744
especially with the fires were

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.646
debris removal debris removal

00:15:13.712 --> 00:15:16.181
is a huge deal typically the

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:18.284
most expensive component of

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.219
any disasters debris removal

00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:22.588
housing task force where

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:25.057
people gonna live watershed

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.992
task force our watersheds have

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:28.827
been decimated by these fires

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:30.829
so we bring in geologists

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:32.698
hydrologists engineers

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.500
firefighters everybody to

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:36.435
analyze the thread a watershed

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:39.538
schools schools get disrupted

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:41.307
how worst our students going to

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:43.409
continue to learn and for the

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:45.577
first time animal task force

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:48.047
we stood up in -- the campfire

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.215
in paradise we had to feed

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:51.950
care for and shelter animals

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:54.019
for months there was a big big

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:56.355
endeavor small animals pets

00:15:56.655 --> 00:15:59.358
large animals two horses mama's

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:01.794
you name it -- but this model

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.096
has worked and so you see in

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:05.764
in the catastrophic event you

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.433
see there's a lot more of these

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:09.301
groups and a lot more areas of

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:11.103
focus that we will need to hit

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.739
-- route clearance

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.607
transportation access will be

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:16.842
one of the first things that

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:18.243
will happen you need to get

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.545
to the side of the dam and she

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.246
needs a clear that debris off of

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:22.881
major freeways you need to make

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:24.450
sure our rail lines are back

00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:26.819
up and running -- I mentioned

00:16:26.885 --> 00:16:28.987
fuels and commodities we we

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.956
will immediately the state and

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:33.359
FEMA push commodities out to

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:35.961
these sites food water shelter

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:37.930
supplies whether it's needed or

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:39.431
not we want to make sure it's

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:42.267
there mass care and shelter

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.370
again housing and schools

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:46.839
utilities electricity so what

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:48.807
we need to do is gather the

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:49.975
right people from the right

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:52.077
agencies include the private

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:54.346
sector and form subject matter

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:56.181
expert groups to make critical

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:57.716
decisions and the tackle these

00:16:57.783 --> 00:16:59.918
problems so this is it's worked

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.854
well in the past few years

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:04.189
this is just a hundred times

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:06.258
bigger than what we face so far

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.729
I did want to touch upon this

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:12.731
this is the unified coordination

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.700
group we call the UCG these

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:16.368
are the decision makers

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:18.670
all right this typically takes

00:17:18.737 --> 00:17:20.339
place at the state operations

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.408
center the governor overseas

00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:25.077
this but you have a high level

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:27.179
decision makers from from key

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.214
departments agencies and groups

00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:30.783
you'll have the California

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:32.384
National Guard be a big player

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:33.752
the adjutant general probably

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.254
general bald one would be in

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.256
there my boss director dealer

00:17:37.322 --> 00:17:38.657
dude she would most likely be

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.392
the state coordinating officer

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:42.060
you have a federal court navy

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:43.829
coordinating officer you'd have

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.030
the commissioner of the highway

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:46.765
patrol and there you have

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.001
Caltrans key agencies public

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:50.836
health department of finance

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.905
department of education --

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:54.606
FEMA's definitely in there as

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:56.708
well as a department of defense

00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:58.343
coordinator it should we need

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.312
those military assets so you

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:02.381
have this core group and what

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:03.982
I do down here in the field I

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:06.485
send my staff out on the ground

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:08.954
to the field to county emergency

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:10.689
operation centers and the city

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.624
or city emergency operations

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.993
city to get out to to centers

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.495
to gather that informational

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.864
awareness female will do the

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.899
same National Guard will do the

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:23.368
same so you have all levels of

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:25.204
government shoulder to shoulder

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.872
in these emergency operations

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.574
center so it's right there

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.076
physically feeding information

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:32.878
and situational awareness up to

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.613
this you see G. group so they

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.315
can make the right decisions

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:37.583
when you're looking at a

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:39.518
scenario like this resources

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:41.520
will be scarce we have to

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:43.555
prioritize we have to be real

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.357
about it and this group will

00:18:45.424 --> 00:18:47.226
ultimately make those decisions

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:52.397
not very excited about this

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.499
you've probably heard about

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:55.067
it earthquake early warning

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:58.070
-- this is a very very cool

00:18:58.136 --> 00:19:00.372
newer technology -- that we

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:02.241
spent -- additional monies on

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.576
we did get funding in this last

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.278
budget round that was that was

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.347
great for testing and I didn't

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:09.515
know this until a few years

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:10.916
ago but there's actually to

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.684
shock waves that happens with

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:14.152
with that with the serious

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:16.421
earthquake it's called a P.

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.957
wave that comes first then

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.392
there's no shaking involved

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:21.560
with that a little burst of

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:24.730
energy there's a gap followed

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.765
by that damaging shockwaves

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.700
causing the the shaking at the

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.736
end and the damage and that gap

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:33.238
is key that gap could provide

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:35.807
needed seconds to act upon

00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:38.176
-- we've got a sensor network

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:39.678
all up and down the state the

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:41.747
state those sensors pick up

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:43.515
that P. wave transmit it to

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:45.450
computer systems that run the

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:47.519
model how big was it where

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:49.555
was it how much time you have

00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:52.024
very exciting -- we've had

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.458
a partnership with the U. S.

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:56.061
G. S. and also you -- UC

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:57.963
Berkeley with with a new app

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.431
that we're testing right now

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:02.467
and I am one of the experimental

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.236
app users at and I think it's

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:07.105
very exciting technology --

00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:08.941
about three weeks ago we had

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.509
a four point oh earthquake in

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.344
riverside county in the town

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:14.646
of will the Mar I was sitting

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:16.682
at my desk at Los Alameda us

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.017
I got the earthquake alert on my

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:21.787
Pham H. it showed me three point

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:23.488
nine something it showed me will

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.624
the Mar and I sat there and sure

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:27.359
enough about four seconds later

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.561
got the little jewel it worked

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:31.496
in action I was very excited

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.832
to see it work in action and

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.400
four seconds is enough time I

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:36.602
I thought it was a three point

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:37.936
nine I did need to get under my

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:40.238
desk but had it been bigger I

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:42.341
would of those key seconds count

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:45.944
-- if it's five point our bigger

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:47.779
we have plans to roll this out

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:49.481
an alert people over cell phones

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:51.817
wireless emergency alerts so if

00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:54.219
it meets a certain threshold --

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:56.254
entire geographic regions could

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:58.657
get alerts -- on your cell

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:00.392
phone and you know looking

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:01.627
into the future I would love

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:03.161
every California to have this

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:05.130
on their phone the capability

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:07.633
it has practical applications

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.568
if you're having brain surgery

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:11.003
I would really like the this

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:13.138
the surgeon to back away -- if

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:15.807
he gets that earthquake warning

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.844
-- in Northridge earthquake

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.879
certain fire stations couldn't

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.015
get their doors open because

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.616
they lost power so the fire

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:26.685
trucks could not respond there's

00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:28.420
a couple stations in Los Angeles

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:30.322
county that are set up in and

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:32.057
hooked up to the system they

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.859
will automatically open so

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:36.028
that's a very big public benefit

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:38.463
-- the transportation sector

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.799
slowing trains down subways

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:43.301
that's very very valuable --

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:46.371
and could save lives pipelines

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:47.839
electrical grid shutting

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:50.442
things down pre shockwave

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:52.044
save a lot of money and a lot

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.212
of lives and there's much much

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:56.748
more -- so we're testing

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.650
it right now we're very close

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:00.185
and -- more to come on this

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:02.587
one and -- gentleman that's

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:04.389
all I have is formal testimony

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:05.957
but I'd be happy to entertain

00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:07.192
any questions you have

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:10.829
can be in any questions are

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:12.798
just a couple questions I have

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:15.667
-- for more thank you all for

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:16.735
for the work you're doing out

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:18.837
there regarding the -- the

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.138
preparedness and portion of

00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:22.040
everything and -- question is

00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:24.476
how does Korea cow -- yes review

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:26.378
and share their emergency plans

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:28.046
with with counties and is that

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:29.848
something that's -- dated --

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:31.583
yearly or every other year I was

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.952
a so our our state plan

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.721
is available to to anybody in

00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:38.990
California -- we assess counties

00:22:39.057 --> 00:22:40.058
with the element of their

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:42.861
plans -- we review these county

00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:45.297
plans we recommend updating

00:22:45.363 --> 00:22:46.998
these about every three years

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:48.433
I think that's prudent things

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.569
change development happens

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:52.070
you communities change I think

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:53.839
three years is a good guideline

00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:56.508
-- what we do is we have a

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:59.678
crosswalk where we will we will

00:22:59.978 --> 00:23:01.613
run through the plan in its

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.215
entirety and will check off

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:04.516
if it meets certain elements

00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:06.184
does it have -- alert morning

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:07.753
elements in it does it address

00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:09.988
all the hazards so we review

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:11.957
it market up provide feedback

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:13.358
if needed and and that's our

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:15.560
review process -- working with

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:17.963
local government and then I

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.731
had another question regarding

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:21.433
-- was I think was the first

00:23:21.933 --> 00:23:24.636
-- slide you showed regarding

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.738
health care in part of the

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.975
-- emerge response plan I

00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:32.043
think -- -- this one here was

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.546
enormous on before or after

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.114
of light yeah healthcare

00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:37.716
transportation healthcare sorted

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:39.151
mean by health care on that

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:42.320
of the public health component

00:23:42.387 --> 00:23:44.756
pretty much for for -- when

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:47.058
you have so many injuries

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:50.328
-- so many deaths potentially

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:52.464
you have to you have to exercise

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:53.965
these medical health plans

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:55.534
it's a another medical health

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.769
side is a is a key component

00:23:57.836 --> 00:24:00.005
partner of of any disaster so

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:02.607
that include sheltering support

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:04.843
that includes it could be --

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.379
patient evacuation that's

00:24:07.445 --> 00:24:08.847
that's also things working

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:10.982
with them ambulance companies

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:11.917
working with department of

00:24:11.983 --> 00:24:13.418
defense on how to of that

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.754
triage and evacuate patients

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:17.823
that's part of the process to

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:20.292
-- so they're they're a big

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:22.360
component partner but it's one

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:23.895
I'm asking I know -- when I

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:25.564
started the legislature a couple

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.532
years ago I know at the time

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:29.167
we have mobile field hospitals

00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:31.036
-- because obviously we're not

00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:32.637
big one comes at you know the

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:34.139
infrastructure alone is going

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:35.807
to be devastating out a we get

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:38.410
patients from -- from the point

00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:40.078
of a disastrous was pretty the

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.547
impact to a hospital -- is

00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:43.782
there any may be plans in the

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:46.017
near future regarding the use

00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:47.152
of mobile field hospital since

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:48.253
we had about one time I know

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.988
the previous administration I

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:51.223
think what Swarts maker that

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:52.357
we had those mobile phone

00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:54.025
hospitals now the kind out

00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:55.627
when a way out of the different

00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:57.095
that thinking now was there's

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.330
no never need for that is that

00:24:58.396 --> 00:24:59.698
something you think that may

00:24:59.764 --> 00:25:01.333
be revisited in the future that

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:03.134
would be a component -- and

00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:04.536
and we have talked about that

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:06.738
one we do have medical caches

00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:08.773
of supplies -- strategically

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.109
located -- we would lean

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:12.611
upon the National Guard and

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:14.145
probably department of defense

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:15.580
they have those capabilities

00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:16.615
that they could set up

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:19.217
for us and just one last

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:20.318
question regarding the early

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:22.754
warning system -- so say the

00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:23.855
earthquake is center here in

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:25.757
Ontario how far out with that

00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:28.760
US alert would go to read

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:30.896
just a county or or to go by

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:33.331
jurisdiction or how how would

00:25:33.398 --> 00:25:35.533
that work I I depends on the

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.802
size -- it you know and and

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:39.404
I can't speak to the specific

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.907
Al Gore them that they use --

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:43.975
I'll give you an example from

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.810
the the Loma Prieta earthquake

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:47.445
-- they had in nineteen eighty

00:25:47.512 --> 00:25:49.347
nine I'm dating myself --

00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:51.783
from the epicenter she if

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.385
this technology was available

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:55.587
then -- the marina district

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:57.422
downtown San Francisco would had

00:25:57.489 --> 00:25:59.391
about twenty seconds occur of

00:25:59.457 --> 00:26:02.027
warning -- but you know if it's

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:03.628
that five point oh magnitude

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:05.063
we want to we want to get it

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.265
out pretty far and wide okay

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:08.733
all right thanks a Jeff if

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.935

the city and county prepare for

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.342
earthquake disaster and respond

to provide input hopefully

00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:13.298
what I sure would be helpful

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:14.766
for you and for those others

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.234
that will utilize information

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:17.635
to hopefully strengthen our

00:27:17.702 --> 00:27:19.237
emergency response instead of

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.706
California -- just just kind

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:23.575
of wanna piggy back off some

00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:25.577
of the comments said -- Jeff

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:27.579
made more or more to provide

00:27:27.645 --> 00:27:29.814
a a positive testimony to how

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:31.583
the process here in California

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:33.385
has worked and worked well in

00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:35.920
my experience -- we utilize

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:37.322
a lot of the processes that

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:38.757
Jeff talked about just a few

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:41.159
minutes ago with our activation

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:42.727
a response to the -- recent

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:45.463
trona incident and still salmon

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.665
a Dino county we also have our

00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:49.734
own -- emergency operations plan

00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:51.803
IT UP which is available online

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:54.472
and it's a high level --

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:57.609
guide strategic guide for --

00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:59.911
that outlines our operational

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:01.946
area the counties approach to

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:04.215
managing incidents and it's

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:05.917
no secret that we rely upon

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:07.752
the same to the Jeff mentioned

00:28:07.986 --> 00:28:10.088
so basically my job the way I

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:11.890
explained it to folks is that

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.059
emergency management our primary

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.227
role is to bring organization

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:18.530
process and protocol in time of

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:21.032
chaos and we utilize out by

00:28:21.099 --> 00:28:23.368
-- using those tools that Jeff

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:24.869
talked about the standardized

00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:27.138
emergency management system --

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:29.674
incident command system the --

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:31.076
national incident management

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:32.510
system those are all tools that

00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:34.579
we use while I don't expect

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.114
the the average member of the

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:37.949
public to be familiar with those

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:39.884
areas I think the confidence

00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:41.252
that we can share with them and

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:42.854
and and the committee here is

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.589
that those that are involved

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.658
in our discipline are familiar

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:48.293
with those and we utilize those

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:49.761
tactic than those processes

00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:51.262
to work well with each other

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:53.398
-- I work well with Jeff Toni

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:55.366
and everyone a callow yes so

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:56.968
Jeff also talked about and I'm

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:58.002
going to kind of jump around

00:28:58.069 --> 00:28:58.970
here a little bit will this

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:01.339
presentation -- just to kind of

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.608
reinforced some points -- so

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:05.677
our E. emergency operations plan

00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:06.978
obviously like Jeff mentioned

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:08.947
is also in collaboration with

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:11.683
-- community stakeholders

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:14.252
everyone from -- government

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:16.988
-- non profits --

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:20.792
business -- you name it

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:22.927
there are involved in the

00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:24.796
providing input -- for

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:26.297
developing our emergency

00:29:26.364 --> 00:29:28.833
operations plan but the the

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.502
thing that I wanted to kind of

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:31.936
focus on here and utilize my

00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.538
time because I know Jeff did a

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:35.507
good job of touch in a lot of

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:37.509
these things here is that so

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:39.611
for example when when we were

00:29:39.677 --> 00:29:42.147
-- impacted by the the incident

00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:44.249
in trona and we activated our

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:46.684
emergency operations center as

00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:48.753
Jeff mentioned all incidents

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.256
are handled at the lowest

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:53.958
local level still trona

00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:55.727
is an unincorporated area of

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:57.529
the county hence that give us

00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:59.197
those jurisdictional authority

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:01.099
to provide immediate support

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:03.168
to that area so part of my role

00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:04.536
at the emergency operations

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:06.638
center was to -- coordinate

00:30:06.704 --> 00:30:08.072
and dispatch a response to

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:09.807
help those impacted by the

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:11.242
earthquake so as part of that

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:13.711
response we immediately set up

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:15.346
what we call commodity points

00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:16.881
of distribution and that's what

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:18.383
we could provide just basic

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:20.051
humanitarian needs to those

00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:22.120
impacted things such as water

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.890
ice -- come for kids --

00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:28.459
also -- -- behavioral

00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:30.662
health services there and that

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:32.363
was set up -- probably within

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.332
sixteen hours of the of the

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:36.401
-- second or the primary --

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.169
earthquake striking those of

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:39.971
folks up in trona so that's

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:42.574
our rule at the EEOC no the

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.142
the other thing I wanted to to

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:46.678
stress upon is cal -- yes

00:30:46.744 --> 00:30:48.880
is always available to assist

00:30:48.947 --> 00:30:50.748
us so as soon as we activate

00:30:50.815 --> 00:30:52.116
our emergency operations

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:53.985
center the state hello yes

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:57.088
dole -- activate their regional

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:58.923
emergency operations center

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.892
in support of our efforts so

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:02.493
there's this cascading affect

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.195
the folks being on stand by from

00:31:04.262 --> 00:31:06.030
the local level to the state

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.498
level to the federal level if

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:09.467
needed and and the remarkable

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.902
thing about this process or why

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:12.904
it works is because it allows us

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:14.906
to coordinate in such a way that

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:16.274
we don't step on each other's

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.643
toes and so as a resources come

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.744
in whether they come in from

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.446
the highest level at the federal

00:31:21.512 --> 00:31:23.414
level they're still gonna be

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:26.584
locally managed and coordinated

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:28.820
at the lowest local level so

00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:30.455
I just wanted to highlight that

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:33.258
that system does work -- and

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:34.626
so I just want to bring that

00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:36.527
to your attention the the other

00:31:36.594 --> 00:31:38.529
thing is to in our world there

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:39.831
there could be a little bit of

00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:41.699
a of a misconception perhaps

00:31:41.766 --> 00:31:44.569
when we talk about evacuation

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.738
stern disasters well obviously

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:49.107
evacuations play a major

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:51.009
component to a lot of different

00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:52.277
types of incidents where there'd

00:31:52.343 --> 00:31:54.646
be a fire of flood man

00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:57.315
made event or even an earthquake

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.350
but in this particular case of

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.519
trono -- there was a lot of

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.054
homes in infrastructure that

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:05.023
was damaged we don't necessarily

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:07.592
see a need for -- large scale

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:09.727
type of -- evacuation effort

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:11.496
the way we handle that and what

00:32:11.562 --> 00:32:12.697
I have here up on the screen

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.132
right now is Sam regional

00:32:14.198 --> 00:32:15.800
counties approach to providing

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.502
services to residents that are

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:19.771
dislocated due to an emergency

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.873
we have what we call a shock or

00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:23.908
a shelter operations compound

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:26.811
into what we did up in trona is

00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:29.580
we actually activated a hybrid

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:31.749
of the system and the reason

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:33.451
why we did that was because

00:32:33.818 --> 00:32:35.953
the city of Rick a rich Chris

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.722
was gracious enough to offer

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:39.891
their shelter to provide shelter

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:41.359
services to the residents of

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:43.528
trona because of the logistics

00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:46.197
involved it was the the best

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:47.899
approach to provide services to

00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:50.068
residents still while we handled

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:51.936
a lot of the -- commodity

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:54.305
points of distributions in the

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:56.607
general trona area for folks

00:32:56.674 --> 00:32:59.477
it needed -- shelter services

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:01.579
we transported those individuals

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.214
to the city of ridgecrest about

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:04.916
twenty twenty five miles away

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:07.151
if if something like this were

00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:08.519
to happen in a different part

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:10.188
of San Medina county and we

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:12.457
did have to offer -- activate a

00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:14.959
shock then the shock would

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:17.995
provide the county a basic

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:19.797
one stop shop approach to

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:21.399
providing services for those

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:22.900
impacted which would include

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:26.070
-- sheltering medical support

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:27.739
-- anything from that there's

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:29.073
an election going on we can

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.209
set up -- our register office

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:33.177
of voters can set up -- --

00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:35.546
place for folks to cast a vote

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:37.749
of we have pretty much every

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:39.317
single county department at our

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:41.352
disposal including -- behavioral

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:43.321
health department of aging

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:44.922
chill Jim services preschool

00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:46.991
services but in addition to

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:48.159
that the great thing about it

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:50.094
is in collaboration with with

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:52.163
the state is we can bring in

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.265
state resources department

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:56.601
of motor vehicles department

00:33:56.667 --> 00:33:58.770
of insurance or any other

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.238
department where there's a

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:02.206
needed gap to provide services

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:04.008
to the residents so so that's

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:05.243
kind of our approach for the

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:08.079
county and a shock is is really

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:10.915
and -- designed to accommodate

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:13.217
anywhere between three thousand

00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:14.685
to five thousand folks that

00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:16.053
have been displaced due to an

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.889
emergency so so we're really

00:34:17.955 --> 00:34:19.390
proud of that program but I

00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:22.026
think most importantly for us --

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:25.296
is that we've tested these plans

00:34:25.363 --> 00:34:26.531
and so there are their battle

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:28.833
tested we realize that one no

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.302
plan no approach is perfect we

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:32.904
feel highly confident in our

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:35.473
ability to execute -- these

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.908
plans in this process is to

00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:39.277
be able to provide services

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:41.312
to those that are impacted so

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.914
that's that's sort of in a nut

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.516
shell the county's role and

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.819
so you know if we you pose the

00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:49.487
question of what if the city

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:51.322
of Ontario would would face to

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.825
an earthquake well our our

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.660
response would be to rely on of

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.328
my friends and my partners here

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.030
Mister Collette on Mister Chung

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:00.698
they would be the first ones

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:02.166
that would coordinate resources

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:04.168
here at the very localized level

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:06.337
activating perhaps probably more

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:08.139
than likely they're emergency

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:10.341
operations center that in turn

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:11.909
would trigger us to activate

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.544
our emergency operations

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.413
center and that will create

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.381
the cascading event for kello

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:19.250
yes to activate their regional

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:21.252
emergency operations center so

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:23.287
I I I say all this not knowing

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:25.556
everyone's -- understanding of

00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:27.258
the processes so I take this

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:28.593
opportunity is an advocate

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:29.594
to just kind of share that

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.429
information -- I know that

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:32.530
there's members of the public

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:33.564
and others who that might not

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:35.433
be aware but that's the process

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.567
that we use your and local

00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:38.369
government so with that be

00:35:38.436 --> 00:35:39.904
happy to answer any questions

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.406

emergency management division

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:24.448
also known as a cities office

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.250
emergency management with this

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:27.418
today's entered as emergency

emergency disaster readiness

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:35.726
in this is having the capability

00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:37.428
and capacity to stand up to

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:39.463
extraordinary emergencies and

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.866
disasters government has plans

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:44.235
procedures equipment tools

00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:46.370
supplies and train staff to

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:48.139
help us meet this responsibility

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:49.907
readiness may be summed up as

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:52.343
having the plans procedures

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.912
resources to a stand respond

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:57.348
to recover from extraordinary

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.951
emergencies and disasters these

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:01.986
plans procedures and resources

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:03.955
are then employed or deployed

00:37:04.455 --> 00:37:05.823
by well trained equipped and

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.726
capable staff a compendium

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.861
of achieving readiness requires

00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:12.063
a purposeful and meaningful

00:37:12.129 --> 00:37:14.465
cycle of planning equipping

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:18.035
training exercising evaluating

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:19.737
and adjusting to changing the

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:21.806
threat environment lessons

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:23.474
learned from past disasters

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.343
and changes in local emergency

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:27.912
response in support capabilities

local governments emergency

00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:32.116
planning capability building

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.719
city building is centered

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:36.053
on the specific threats and

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.289
hazards to that jurisdiction

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.291
these threats and hazards then

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:43.227
analyzed and assess to quantify

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.929
associated risk involved

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.297
abilities to the community

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.666
plans procedures capabilities

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:50.334
and capacities are then built

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:52.570
around those that are needed

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:54.338
to withstand respond to recover

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:56.207
from threats and hazards that

00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:58.476
pose the highest risk and

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:00.077
have the highest probability

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:01.946
of impacting our communities

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:03.748
threaten rest each community

00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:05.883
are dependent upon many factors

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.619
not limited to climate geography

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:11.088
elevation population population

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:13.391
density built up infrastructure

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:15.292
and other factors each of

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.460
us here today representing

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:17.795
different jurisdictions levels

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.764
of government have our own set

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.499
of threats and hazards unique

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:23.567
to our communities with this in

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:25.036
mind or individual preparedness

00:38:25.102 --> 00:38:27.638
efforts as mentioned today --

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:29.674
well based on the same sound

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:31.342
emergency management principles

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.477
practices and standards will

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:35.179
be unique uniquely premised

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:37.048
upon our own particular needs

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:38.983
emergency evacuation one of

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.985
those emergency functions unique

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:42.753
to each of our own communities

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:44.422
the city of Ontario enjoys a

00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:46.524
relatively flat terrain well

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.925
protected by exceptional flood

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.393
control devices a measures

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.295
and devoid of any significant

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:52.797
wildland urban interface

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:55.466
wildfire threat as such our

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:56.867
need to conduct large scale

00:38:56.934 --> 00:38:58.436
evacuations in the face of a

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.938
major flooding debris flows or

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:03.074
wildfire is a low risk and low

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.309
probability event are back you

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:07.144
Asians are limited to small

scale evacuations prompted by

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.248
localized more routine events

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:14.385
I such as structural fires

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:16.487
has is materials releases the

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:18.055
law enforcement operations

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:19.623
earthquakes would be an example

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.425
of a high impact event with

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:23.360
wide scale in broad implications

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:24.628
to all jurisdictions seated

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:27.198
here today evacuations result

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.699
of a major earthquake would

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:29.867
likely be in response to

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:32.169
uncontrolled fire has a natural

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:34.338
releases untenable business

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:35.806
or residential structures

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:37.942
these again would more likely

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:39.944
be limited to small sailboat

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.846
decorations Senate on localize

00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:44.081
risk conducting mass scale

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:45.750
evacuation moving large numbers

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.184
of people from one affected

00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:49.086
jurisdiction to another affected

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:50.821
neighboring jurisdiction in

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.389
response to earthquake in

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:54.525
most cases would likely not be

00:39:54.592 --> 00:39:56.594
warranted and made it virtually

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.695
an impact the receiving

00:39:57.762 --> 00:40:00.097
jurisdictions I who have also

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:02.466
likely not seen the effects

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:03.734
of the damaging earthquake

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:06.470
the carry out emergency

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:07.838
functions such evacuation the

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:10.074
local government level we rely

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.509
on several established emergency

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.043
management plans and systems

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:14.411
many of these already mentioned

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:16.447
today but these do include

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.782
the California standardizing

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.583
burn to management system the

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.018
national emergency incident

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.253
management system modeled

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:24.288
after California system the

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:26.390
incident command system multi

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:28.692
agency coordination system at

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.127
a local jurisdictions emergency

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.129
operations plan while these

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:33.397
plans the system the rigidly

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:35.132
structured they allow for

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:37.001
flexibility and now such service

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:39.537
frameworks that can be applied

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:41.505
to any disaster or emergency

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:43.407
these frameworks then allow

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:44.675
for emergency functions such

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:46.877
as evacuations to be executed

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:48.379
even in the absence of unique

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:50.414
and specific functional plants

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:52.249
as my colleagues may agree to

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:54.418
California is local government

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.153
you're a subdivisions are

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.455
uniquely postured to withstand

00:40:58.522 --> 00:40:59.623
extraordinary emergencies

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.358
and disasters we are well

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:03.194
equipped trained and exercise

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.329
to the size scope repetitive

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:07.364
nature of the state's disaster

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:09.767
portfolio I like to close with

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.869
this our readiness requires

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:13.571
purposeful and meaningful keep

00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:15.206
building capacity building

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:17.274
disaster response recovery

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:19.643
requires executable plans

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:22.379
teachers and systems employed

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:23.948
they well trained and well

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:25.983
equipped personnel our internal

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.085
capabilities any discernible gap

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:30.087
in capacities are complemented

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:31.288
by California's robust

00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:33.324
emergency management system of

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.025
cooperation resource sharing

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:37.528
mutual aid for the supported

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.330
by flexible and expandable

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:40.965
emergency plans and systems

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:44.168
thank you with that

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:45.236
will move on to a Rendon

00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:46.604
city Montero thank you

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:50.708
thank you and good afternoon

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.309
-- Raymond Cheung city venture

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:55.112
emerging manager -- so

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:56.614
our partners of already talked

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.515
about a lot of the systems and

00:41:58.582 --> 00:42:00.117
processes and procedures we

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:02.119
have in place to manage a large

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.787
scale disasters I'm a take this

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:04.889
opportunity to talk a little

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.957
bit about our specific programs

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:09.627
at the local level because as

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:12.062
Mister Tony mentioned -- all

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:13.731
disasters are locally managed

00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:15.466
a summer -- kind of highlight

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:17.334
a few of our -- programs we

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:19.403
have in the city of Ontario --

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.906
here in Ontario we do have -- a

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:24.108
what we call a hot or full

00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:25.309
time emergency operations

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:26.744
center I will talk a lot lot

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.979
about UC's saccharine already

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:30.547
as we are very very fortunate

00:42:30.614 --> 00:42:33.217
to have this -- UC available

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.885
that -- it would take only

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:37.655
minutes to activate verses --

00:42:38.155 --> 00:42:40.424
maybe several hours of for

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.393
a cold EOC and call the OC is

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:43.794
one and may not have tables

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:45.562
or chairs a laptop Sir other

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:48.532
equipment out unfortunately --

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:49.867
you know many cities do not have

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:52.036
the resources to have a hot UC

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:54.371
-- and we we are fortunate to

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:55.739
have that -- so what are you

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:57.675
see we've got you know it it

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.510
Davey system with projectors

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:01.946
laptops out phones satellite

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:03.647
phones communication equipment

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:05.716
-- and so we were very very well

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:07.818
prepared -- in this facility to

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:10.287
be able to manage a a disaster

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:13.023
-- that the UC is that place

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.326
where -- mortal agencies can

00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:16.527
get together when that face

00:43:16.593 --> 00:43:17.528
the face shoulders shoulder

00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:19.630
environment where -- we really

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:20.831
we we can come together and

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:22.333
solve the biggest problems

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:24.234
at hand and face to face can

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:25.803
occasions always the the best

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:28.172
kind of communication I in terms

00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:30.074
of how we organize in the UC

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:31.675
if you know it's a standards

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:34.378
management system -- dot dot

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:35.980
it's a command systems Sims

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:38.482
nam's -- and these concepts

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:41.051
really are -- based out of

00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:43.253
-- the military as well as

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.222
standard business management

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.390
concepts of their tried and

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.859
true -- men and we use them --

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.861
every day in Amherst management

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:53.330
-- at the local level typically

00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:55.966
any UC's led by you see director

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.168
-- and that person is usually

00:43:58.235 --> 00:44:00.771
the city manager or a police

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:03.073
chief or fire chief -- that's

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.708
pretty standard throughout

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:06.110
-- the cities in California

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:09.246
-- there is the -- wall for

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.347
elected officials you know

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:12.750
they may be what's in the it

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:13.884
was called the policy group

00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:15.853
advising that you see director

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:18.722
on certain -- high level policy

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:21.859
-- changes or direction -- that

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:23.761
-- you know maybe concerning

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.295
to the community as a whole

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:28.465
one of the programs are very

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:30.734
very proud of here in the west

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:32.036
end of San Diego county is what

00:44:32.102 --> 00:44:33.570
we call the regional you see

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:35.239
academy are we all know that

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:36.707
training is very very important

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:38.409
in terms of you know how we

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:40.377
prepare for that -- that big

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.279
disaster -- you know there's a

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.680
saying that them the more you

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.349
of sweat in training the less

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:47.117
he pleaded combat and we truly

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:48.786
take this to heart a and one

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:49.987
the ways we train is through

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:52.489
this regional you see economy in

00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:53.991
the west and this does consist

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:55.426
of the cities are on Terrio

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:57.728
Rancho Cucamonga -- Chino Chino

00:44:57.795 --> 00:45:00.330
hills and one player -- and

00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:01.799
with this is a collaborative

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:04.034
effort where we get together and

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:06.403
jointly train -- the personal

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.572
in our cities to our work in

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.307
the UC's we take a standard

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:12.176
set of classes offered by the

00:45:12.242 --> 00:45:13.911
state of California and these

00:45:13.977 --> 00:45:15.746
classes are used to fulfill our

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:17.514
the a a state type three you

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:19.216
see position credential that

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:21.752
will allow those those

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:23.921
-- personnel to you know be

00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:25.556
basically trained basically

00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:27.658
qualified to work in any UC

00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:29.993
-- I'm during a disaster --

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:30.994
like I said is a collaborative

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:32.629
effort you know all all of

00:45:32.696 --> 00:45:33.931
our cities are limited in our

00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:35.999
resources so we always want to

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.901
work together in both response

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:40.003
and the prepares phases --

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.439
of -- of immersing act and

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:44.108
they get the job done hi this

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:46.276
is a bi annual Academy so I

00:45:46.343 --> 00:45:47.111
you know it it's something

00:45:47.177 --> 00:45:49.613
that we we have -- ongoing

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.848
-- throughout the year

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:53.884
I of course you know

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:56.253
having the public repaired is

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.421
also very very important you

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:58.989
know that's why we're here as

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:00.090
public servants we are here to

00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:02.292
serve the public -- so we spent

00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:04.495
a lot of time on ensuring that

00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:06.897
the public understands how

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:08.665
to get prepared and the methods

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:11.568
-- used to get prepared -- out

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:13.237
like that that are gonna altered

00:46:13.303 --> 00:46:14.671
a single bit but -- you know an

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:16.073
ounce of preparedness is really

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.474
worth the pound a response

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:20.244
-- -- so we we really try

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.945
to get the public prepared --

00:46:22.012 --> 00:46:24.047
as much as possible -- this

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:26.083
we we do conduct up for merit

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:27.718
preparedness booths at at

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:30.120
a public events a year long

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:32.656
-- year round -- we do a

00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:34.591
preparedness expo -- once years

00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:36.860
well -- so we take as many

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:38.595
options as you can do to you

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:39.796
know have those touch points for

00:46:39.863 --> 00:46:40.831
the public so they cannot they

00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:43.133
understand that really we need

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.269
their help and and -- preparing

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:46.403
the community as a whole

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.573
a part of that era is just

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.108
something that just pass is

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:53.277
actually a September is national

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:55.846
preparedness month a and now

00:46:55.913 --> 00:46:57.648
all of us immerse managers go

00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:59.416
through a lot of different --

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.585
efforts to get the our public

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:02.819
prepared during this month

00:47:03.253 --> 00:47:05.522
-- just as an example -- in

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:07.558
Ontario we conducted a few

00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:09.059
of these events including --

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:11.128
Skender hides -- and -- quick

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:13.130
escape room a and a kind of

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.898
a role playing disaster table

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:16.667
top exercise I would try to

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:18.168
make these events as fun and

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:19.469
engaging as possible because

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:21.238
you know disasters are not

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:23.907
necessarily the the -- no

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:25.642
most fine topic that do think

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:27.211
about or discuss so we try to

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:29.446
-- act use that route that

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:32.349
engage -- engage folks the

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:33.717
the get the better prepared

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:36.587
another way we get people

00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:38.355
prepared is through our radio on

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:40.757
Terrio campaign -- this includes

00:47:40.824 --> 00:47:43.327
a website that we host as well

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:44.661
this website is kind of our

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:46.430
our one stop shop preparedness

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:48.665
portal for folks in come in and

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:50.200
they don't have a communications

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:52.936
plan or business continuity

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:54.371
plan they can go on this website

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:56.039
and download a template to fill

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:58.075
out also includes a different

00:47:58.141 --> 00:47:59.176
supply lists that people can

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.111
go out and you know if if they

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:02.646
need a Mrs by the don't know

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:03.747
what to get you know we give

00:48:03.814 --> 00:48:06.416
them that list on and also

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.085
a volunteer opportunities for

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.353
people to if they want even

00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:11.355
more involved or learn how they

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:13.123
can participate in the response

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.025
efforts on those are listed

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:16.860
here as well additionally even

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:18.395
real time instant information

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:20.063
we include a map on there --

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.431
that if we had road closures

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:23.500
our shelter locations evacuation

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:24.635
areas things like that that

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:25.736
would be shared on on this

00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:27.938
website another way we share

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:29.339
information because information

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.108
we now -- during disaster is

00:48:31.174 --> 00:48:33.377
probably -- on the our most

00:48:33.443 --> 00:48:35.279
valuable resource there is

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:37.080
-- mass notification system

00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:38.415
or alert on Jerry was a we

00:48:38.482 --> 00:48:39.983
call it here -- in the city

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.718
-- we are very lucky to have

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:43.954
a -- mastication istom system

00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:46.957
and on this system includes a

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:48.692
land line numbers -- that we

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:49.459
purchased through the phone

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.161
company as well as people who

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:53.163
register their cell phones

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:55.632
-- and email addresses -- --

00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:57.100
for us to contact them during

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:58.969
the -- during an emergency

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:01.038
-- so information again like

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:03.040
shelters and evacuations

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:04.174
I would we would use this

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.642
system to notify the public

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:09.946
out we also managed a cert

00:49:10.013 --> 00:49:11.014
program are too many Mercer

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:14.084
Spahn steam on this is response

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:15.719
focused we all know that

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:16.887
during a big disaster are

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:18.255
for sponsoring me extremely

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.257
excellent extremely busy --

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:22.326
and are going to the highest

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:24.594
priority events and -- the

00:49:24.661 --> 00:49:26.697
public you know they may not see

00:49:26.763 --> 00:49:27.931
those first responders for quite

00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:29.032
sometime if they're not that

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:30.400
one those you know begins in

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.903
locations so we trained --

00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:35.272
these folks to be able to -- at

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:36.573
home and in their neighborhoods

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.209
be better prepared as well as

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:40.877
what are the kind of response

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:43.547
tactics necessary to survive

00:49:43.613 --> 00:49:44.848
those first few hours first

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:46.717
few days of that disaster all

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:48.285
this in training clue it's a

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:50.020
disaster medical operations --

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:51.288
disaster preparedness disaster

00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:53.957
psychology US team organization

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:55.492
and fire safety because we know

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.160
that of fire following work

00:49:57.227 --> 00:49:58.395
week is probably going to be

00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:01.198
no one of the the -- big causes

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:03.967
of damage I during that scenario

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:06.269
all this is also a way to get

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.506
-- our members a public engaged

00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:12.209
in the disaster response process

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:13.677
that as well as during the the

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:15.879
preparedness phase so I it it's

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:17.647
a very very well loved program

00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:18.815
and and we're happy offered

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.183
here in the city of Ontario

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.819
another program that -- we just

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:24.221
kicked off actually is what we

00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:25.455
call the leaders and prepares

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:27.924
academy of this concept is is

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:30.260
new and growing -- throughout

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:31.795
our region and and possibly the

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:34.364
state of this is very very close

00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:36.700
to what the intention of service

00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:37.934
but really concentrating on the

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.336
prepare his days were Sir is

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:40.904
really looking at response this

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:43.173
is all about preparedness -- and

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:45.809
-- giving the folks the the

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:49.012
knowledge -- of what

00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:50.547
systems we do have in place

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:51.481
a lot of things we're talking

00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:54.184
about here today but really

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.153
how they can impact you know

00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:58.088
preparedness -- individually

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:00.891
so -- you know at the end

00:51:00.957 --> 00:51:02.392
of the series of classes is

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:03.660
currently nine classes about

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:05.829
twenty hours long of a multi

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:09.132
agency -- multi disciplined --

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.301
had a training where we have

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:13.703
so cal gas so cal Edison our

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.572
water department -- police

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:18.241
fire -- is a nor sage called

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:19.543
by operation hope which is

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:20.911
about financial a disaster

00:51:20.977 --> 00:51:22.446
financial literacy no it's a

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:24.080
collaborative effort -- and

00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:26.750
at the end of this class of

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:28.819
each of the individual graduates

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:30.020
makes what's called prepare his

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:32.088
promise where they think about

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:34.257
and they actually you know --

00:51:34.324 --> 00:51:36.793
make this promise to do more

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.528
to do something you in you their

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:41.598
their -- place of business their

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:44.234
school -- their neighborhood

00:51:44.301 --> 00:51:45.135
you know somewhere where they

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:46.870
can really be be that ports

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:49.072
of change and act as a leader

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:51.808
within -- the -- a disaster

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:54.578
preparedness so I we're we're

00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:55.612
very hopeful that you know

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:57.647
this will continue on and

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:59.816
grow and and hopefully really

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:01.618
-- impact meaningful change

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:04.354
-- in in the state --

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:06.756
couple things out of weird

00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:10.427
-- concerned about in a

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:12.596
at the local level -- is

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:15.499
-- sing link that we we --

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:17.901
want to improve upon our

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.402
alert warning so what I talked

00:52:19.469 --> 00:52:21.271
a little bit about our --

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:24.474
-- mastication system --

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.810
up earlier -- so we're very

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:27.844
lucky to have a master of

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:29.613
creation program of this the

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:31.147
state of California recently

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.683
released the learn warning

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.151
guidelines recommending that

00:52:35.218 --> 00:52:37.420
all cities have us system like

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:39.623
this unfortunate all cities

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:42.025
have that the resources as

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:43.360
we do this bill will have the

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:45.829
system -- and some so something

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:48.565
to kind of keep in mind

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:51.201
as you -- go about thinking

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.435
about how we can improve the

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.137
systems in the state it is

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:56.506
whether it makes sense for you

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.208
know maybe the state level to

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:00.777
to have a a statewide system

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.312
and that really helps in terms

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:03.747
of you know marketing the

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.549
system and ensuring more people

00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:06.616
registered as a lot of times

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:08.685
we do not have a cell phones or

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:10.554
email addresses of for people

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.256
so we rely on an opt in system

00:53:13.623 --> 00:53:15.792
-- -- I know that in Orange

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:17.027
County have system call alert

00:53:17.093 --> 00:53:18.595
-- see and it being a county

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:20.363
wide system allows them that

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.766
additional marketing effort --

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:25.035
to get those folks registered

00:53:25.302 --> 00:53:26.269
within the county so it's

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:28.405
it's a big benefit -- and with

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:29.573
the state having fifty eight

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:31.408
counties forty four animations

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:33.009
municipalities you know that

00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:35.278
kind of effort I really would

00:53:35.345 --> 00:53:36.613
go a long way to a shared

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:38.782
how the last thing I want to

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:40.817
touch on is you know in terms

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.218
of all will populations we

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:44.521
understand that the most

00:53:44.588 --> 00:53:46.122
vulnerable among us or the

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:47.724
most likely to be victims and

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.259
disasters we know this from

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:51.194
every single disaster -- that

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:53.630
we research -- you know today

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:55.298
you know there's a state as said

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.233
that forty percent of Americans

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.135
cannot paid an unexpected formed

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:01.004
all the bill I know then that's

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:03.406
is not for us you know daily

00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:05.108
day emergencies but a massively

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:06.776
affects how people are able

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:07.978
to respond to recover from

00:54:08.044 --> 00:54:10.814
disasters wall odds with

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.248
yelp nationwide this is an

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:13.683
issue and especially in terms

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.385
of from look at our homelessness

00:54:15.452 --> 00:54:17.954
crisis are how however you know

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:20.390
it it again it it will impact

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:22.092
our disaster recovery efforts

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:24.294
-- as well so you know efforts

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:26.162
to try to contain that crisis

00:54:26.229 --> 00:54:27.564
is going to do a lot more than

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:28.732
just the day to day it's gonna

00:54:28.798 --> 00:54:30.900
extension into the -- disaster

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:33.470
world -- and that's all Ortez

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:34.871
might have been a happy to take

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.873
any questions thank you okay

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.375
thank you with that I think --

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:39.809
some rumor Medina had a question

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:41.911
or two to ask I did thank you

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:43.713
very much a lot of valuable

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.181
information I especially

00:54:45.248 --> 00:54:47.684
appreciated your addressing

00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:50.186
what individual families can do

00:54:50.253 --> 00:54:52.422
to prepare something that was

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:54.758
-- brought up by our colleague

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:57.127
-- moon Monique Limon own

00:54:57.193 --> 00:54:58.928
who represents Santa Barbara

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:01.865
and in their -- wild fires

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:04.968
and mud -- catastrophes

00:55:05.035 --> 00:55:06.670
that she dealt with and that

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.672
she brought up legislation and

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:10.874
the day -- would like to hear

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:13.643
is addressing the the public

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:16.012
who who speak very is different

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.814
languages and the difficulty

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:20.517
that Santa Barbara had in that

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:22.285
in their communication and I

00:55:22.352 --> 00:55:23.787
believe that she introduced

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:25.755
in and got legislation passed

00:55:26.189 --> 00:55:28.658
on just that so I prepared

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:30.393
it art would would your cities

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:33.129
be in being able to -- address

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:35.365
-- populations that speaker

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:37.467
don't understand -- English

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:41.538
hi I can take that so --

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:43.373
we again we are fortunate

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.141
on cherry to have a massive

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:47.210
cation program -- and through

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:48.411
that program we do have the

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:51.181
ability to do -- to to have

00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:53.717
templates to have AB multiple

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:56.453
languages -- of pre translated

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.021
so and so we're able to reach

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:59.589
the but those populations

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:02.892
-- more effectively -- again

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.394
you know we are lucky I

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:06.863
don't aye aye I don't think

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.131
too many jurisdictions have

00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:09.566
that ability as well as

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:10.767
we do to be able to that

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:13.036
thank you

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:17.674
I had a question regarding --

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:19.309
the search teams that we have

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:20.643
here Montero office I think

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.178
those are a big help for our

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:23.780
first responders because --

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:25.081
pretty much be the first ones

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:27.450
are and some of these -- areas

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:28.985
so how many surgeons does

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:30.954
on Tero happened with that

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.022
-- is -- the county somebody

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.424
notices cities like on terror

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:36.226
-- regarding -- certain

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:37.727
qualifications or I should

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:39.162
say -- getting more folks

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.664
involved so we currently have

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:43.466
you know one one on two Sir

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:45.869
team -- you know we're what

00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:47.637
we're looking at is building

00:56:47.704 --> 00:56:49.072
additional neighborhood teams

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:50.673
-- you know that's kind of a

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.542
something we we wanna -- to

00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:54.043
more of in the future as as

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:55.879
we build out -- the program

00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:57.914
for sure broke from the

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.449
county side we actually manage

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:02.185
multiple Sir -- programs --

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:04.220
in our unincorporated areas

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.588
as well as some of the city's

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.323
for example we help the --

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.425
city of Fontana upland grand

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:11.094
terrace we also have many

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:12.796
unincorporated areas that --

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.964
we oversee there Sir programs

00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:16.900
we receive -- -- funding

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:18.535
specifically to support those

00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:20.637
programs in addition to that

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:22.672
-- -- real exciting in terms of

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:24.507
also system with communication

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:25.909
as we also have a least those

00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:27.710
program which the emphasis is

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.345
for our Spanish speaking folks

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:31.481
-- and so that that program sort

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:33.349
of mirrors a cert program but

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:34.517
it's for individuals that don't

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:35.919
speak English it's for folks

00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:37.720
to speak Spanish and we're also

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:40.256
taking a look at -- expanding

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:42.592
that -- to other folks were --

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.761
other other languages including

00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:47.063
-- Vietnamese -- so it's

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.898
it's something that we we are

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:51.100
sensitive to and -- we're

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:52.802
real proud of our Sir programs

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:56.472
also -- regarding -- the city

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:58.641
Montero plans is that something

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:00.476
on terror you update yearly

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:02.846
every other year and it's one

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.113
thing we do have the plans

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.349
but is there any table top

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:08.384
discussions are or how the

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:09.986
plan would working case that a

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:11.354
disaster comes because we can

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.122
have all the plans we want both

00:58:13.189 --> 00:58:14.324
we don't practice those plans

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.491
update those plans they're no

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:17.227
good so just curse of of what

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:18.228
you guys are doing regarding

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:19.762
the plans sure I'll go ahead

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:21.898
and dress that -- so our our

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:23.566
mercy plans Jeff pointed out it

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:24.801
is is there on I I don't under

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:27.203
update cycle -- but typically

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:29.405
is we we periodically --

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:31.274
completely revise rebuild that

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:32.842
plan every three to five years

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:36.246
-- however is every exercise

00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:38.147
every training event every post

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:40.350
disaster -- critique and

00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:42.819
evaluation is we go back it back

00:58:42.886 --> 00:58:45.288
and just those plans because is

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:47.657
we've are adjusted capability

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.326
we are bill capacities we've

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.495
applied those lessons learned

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:53.162
and that's kind of when the

00:58:53.229 --> 00:58:54.464
important things that we do

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:56.566
is we identify lessons learned

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:58.167
from previous disasters but more

00:58:58.234 --> 00:59:00.570
importantly is we apply those

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:02.939
lessons learned to enhancing

00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:04.641
or bolstering those plans and

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:06.943
capabilities so to to kind of

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.878
that the direct cancer is after

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:11.648
each exercise each disastrous

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:14.350
EOC activation out we update

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:17.053
revised those plans okay

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:19.756
and -- one of his one elaborate

00:59:19.822 --> 00:59:21.758
expel a bit more what are some

00:59:21.824 --> 00:59:23.126
remember Medina talked about

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:24.294
the language barriers with some

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.429
of these communities -- power

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:28.031
plants not only with those

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:30.099
folks but with the individuals

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:31.634
-- the children the elderly and

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:33.469
disabled communities right how

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:35.471
do we assist them in vacuum with

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:37.073
them as well do we have plans in

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.308
place for that as well I would

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:40.510
imagine so -- yes Sir actually

00:59:40.576 --> 00:59:42.545
were required to have -- not

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:43.913
only language there are plans

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.548
but we also from a practical

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:47.116
standpoint that that's one of

00:59:47.183 --> 00:59:48.351
the key things that we actually

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.386
exercise only trying to so so

00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:51.554
really what we're talking about

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:52.922
is the axis and functional

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:54.457
needs community which could be

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:56.092
anywhere up that has perhaps

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:57.193
will we would recognize more

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.062
traditionally as a perhaps

00:59:59.128 --> 01:00:00.863
a a disability in terms of

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.231
maybe somebody that's bound

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:04.033
to a wheelchair but it also

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.902
includes people that may not

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.737
necessarily speaker understand

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.372
English those could be folks

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.573
that could be identified as

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.475
per potentially having an

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.911
axis and functional needs --

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:18.014
-- ability to comprehend

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.549
so we're sensitive to that

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:20.950
to those components are built

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:23.052
into our plans but as as my

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.587
colleagues have said from a

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:27.090
practical standpoint is exercise

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:29.325
in that so so we absolutely do

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:31.127
and also wanted to say that from

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:33.129
the county's perspective we're

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:35.398
real proud of the fact that it's

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.733
not just about the plants the

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:38.534
plants just one component it I

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.737
I use a sports analogy if we're

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.372
not gonna practice and we must

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.207
not will help plants because the

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:46.376
plans are not going to be able

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:48.511
to be executed unless people put

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.613
in sweat equity so I'm really

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.015
proud to say right now is as

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:54.317
we speak right now votes for my

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.085
department actually conducting

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.720
the table top exercise with our

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.489
elected officials so something

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:01.024
that we take very seriously

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.425
we're very prideful and it's

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.227
something that it this committee

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:06.195
can take back -- anything that

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.730
we can get in terms of support

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.766
for ongoing not only funding

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.334
for exercise programs and

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:13.503
training critical to what we do

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.039
okay thank you very much for

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.774

this afternoon -- unlike

-- many jurisdictions of the

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.463
-- responsibility for the city

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.998

Linda Matthews at city Pomona

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.529
-- unlike most agencies

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.597
the city does have an

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:48.865
emergency operations plan

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.133
it's an all hazards plan

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.001
doesn't concentrate just on

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:55.037
earthquakes it -- covers

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.573
-- of multiple disasters

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.942
should they occur -- the

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:01.677
operations plan is posted on

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:02.812
the city's website so it's

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:05.448
available to -- anybody that

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:07.517
would log on to the website and

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.652
can take a look at it -- it was

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:11.287
adopted by the promoter city

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:12.788
council in July two thousand

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:15.124
eleven -- we are in the process

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:18.194
now of updating that plan

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.229
-- and it's expected at that

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:21.597
process will take a look a

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:22.665
little bit to get through

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:25.401
-- we also have a hazard

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.069
mitigation plan -- to go

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:29.805
along with that as well --

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:31.807
in the event of a disaster

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:33.910
emergency large healers quick

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:35.778
the city would -- activated

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:37.280
its emergency operations center

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.683
-- the -- operations center

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.318
is manned by city personnel

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.453
assigned city personnel --

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.922
if it happens during business

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:48.024
hours -- employees assigned

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.659
to the center would would --

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.260
be instructed to respond there

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:53.029
in and soon their duties and

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:55.131
and pass that their sign if it

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:58.134
occurs -- in the -- --

01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:00.937
off business hours the employees

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.538
have a call in number that they

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:03.839
can call and they'll be given

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:05.541
instructions if you're assigned

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:06.709
to the emergency operations

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.678
center then you report there it

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:09.779
whether it's a nation after a

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.948
bi shift -- and if you're not

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.282
assigned there then you're the

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:14.483
employees are advise with the

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.419
to come to work or not and maybe

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.421
other duties -- will be assigned

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:22.625
the -- emergency operations

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.560
center is housed at --

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:26.362
Brackett field in la Verne

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.731
-- we have just completed

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:31.701
the movement to that --

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:33.736
in its -- it does not

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.972
I wouldn't call it a a hot

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.306
emergency operations center

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:38.975
as -- the city of Ontario

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:42.011
ours is more of a a warm --

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:44.614
we do have -- --

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.416
equipment -- station that and

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.285
in the the helicopter hangar

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:51.287
-- and it could be activated

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:52.955
within thirty minutes of of

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:54.557
the should the need arise

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.263
-- as the -- event unfolds our

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.964
EOC will provide support to

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:03.366
the field and first responder

01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:05.868
personnel -- and we will also be

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:08.337
in contact with the Los Angeles

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.972
county emergency operations

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.009
-- the city will communicate

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:14.543
with LA county through the

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.612
or system -- the operational

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:17.947
error response and recovery

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:20.583
system -- that's -- and

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:23.152
an online -- reporting system

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:24.587
in the event that that is not

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.956
available -- there are --

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:28.357
hand held radios that we can

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:30.593
also reports -- to the county

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.296
-- it through this system

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:34.463
should the city of Pomona

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:36.232
need additional assistance

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:37.333
we can make the request

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.902
through LA county -- and

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:42.672
hopefully -- resources are

01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:44.373
available and if not then --

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.442
the county will escalate the

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:49.045
request up up the line --

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:51.414
is as far as LA county -- they

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.982
have divided the the county

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:55.217
into -- a disaster management

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.553
areas -- a through H. the

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.255
city of Pomona is a member of

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:01.924
area D. which is composed

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:03.125
of approximately twenty three

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:05.161
cities in the San Gabriel Valley

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:08.731
-- each area has a -- disaster

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.366
management area coordinator

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.301
and it's just -- coordinator

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:13.736
who will be the liaison between

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.271
the city of Pomona and LA

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.806
county should the need arise

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:20.543
as the -- event

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:23.412
unfolds -- and -- we

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.215
-- you'll see personnel are are

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:27.616
trying to get a handle on on the

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:30.453
extent -- of the disaster

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:33.155
and and keep in mind --

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:34.857
the first responders will

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.692
will be out there to the EEOC

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:38.961
its job is to support -- the

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:40.930
first responders but as we

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:42.865
we are able to get somewhat

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:43.933
of an idea of what's going

01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:45.534
on the city will then deploy

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:48.104
a damage assessment teams --

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.805
and we will use those to try

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:51.140
and determine that the scope

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.341
and extent of the damage that's

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.076
been caused critical areas

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.144
that need more assistance

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:57.446
than others -- and the needs

01:06:57.513 --> 01:07:00.282
for additional resources --

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:04.320
if the -- disaster occurs

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:05.955
during business hours in Pomona

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:07.556
has developed -- an employee

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:09.992
evacuation plan -- we're we will

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:13.129
evacuate -- the employees from

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:14.730
city facilities -- so we can

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:16.966
get them out safely -- and

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:18.667
once they're evacuated the

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:21.303
proceed to assign areas where

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.539
-- for lack of better term roll

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.374
call can be taken -- so that

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:27.076
we can account for personnel

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:28.444
-- and its personnel are

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:31.046
missing -- then we can advise

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:32.114
the first responders when

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:33.749
they arrive on scene that that

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:35.017
either everybody is accounted

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:36.819
for or there are missing

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.888
personality was in various

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:40.523
departments are for whatever

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:46.762
we've also a as part of our

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:49.098
program -- we have designated

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:51.100
for a community centers as

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:52.701
emergency evacuation centers

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.603
-- we've designated --

Washington Park Palomar's park

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.274
west month park inclination

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.544

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:03.879
-- will be instructed to to

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:05.714
-- proceed to those centers

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:08.851
-- if they can't get their --

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.386
we have had discussions with

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:11.654
foothill transit hopefully we

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.988
can use public transportation

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.724
to help get them there -- also

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.460
potentially using an used city

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:19.195
vehicles of if we have to roam

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.329
the streets and and pick up

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:21.964
people and and get them to the

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:24.600
-- evacuation centers the city

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:25.734
of Pomona has entered into

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.470
agreements with the American

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:30.206
red cross for shelter operations

01:08:30.739 --> 01:08:33.476
-- and assuming they're

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.877
not overstretched they will come

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.979
in and and run the -- shelters

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:38.080
after they've been set up by

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:40.115
city staff city staff have

01:08:40.182 --> 01:08:42.351
been trained -- in setting up

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.420
-- the shelters and doing the

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:45.754
initial running until American

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.556
red cross -- comes on site

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:51.927
-- the as far as notifications

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:54.196
-- the notification system that

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:55.831
the city currently uses called

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:57.299
Mixels it's through the police

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:59.401
department -- it's a voluntary

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:01.470
sign up -- residents can sign

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.138
up and then they'll receive --

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:06.008
messages -- for for various

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:06.842
things and in the event of

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.711
an emergency messages will be

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:11.647
sent out -- we've also

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:14.149
-- would rely on faith based

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.385
organizations the they are are

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.221
-- well -- in tune with their

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:20.122
communities and they can

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.724
help get the word out as well

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.895
-- if if worse comes to

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:27.496
worse we will also use these

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:28.797
damage assessment teams and

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:30.165
and city employees to go door

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:31.700
to door to knock on doors

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:34.136
-- vice people of of --

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:36.906
need to evacuate -- and

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:39.875
-- things of that nature --

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:44.914
we have a --

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.583
it is four hours -- other

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:49.351
notifications we we can also use

01:09:49.418 --> 01:09:51.020
the -- police helicopters well

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:52.922
it's got loudspeakers and --

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:55.291
also police vehicles -- that can

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:57.660
roam through the neighborhood --

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:00.029
Mona itself does not have a

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.830
search team -- although there is

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:04.433
a Pomona valley -- Sir team

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:07.269
-- it is a -- a team is made

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.638
up of -- individual citizens

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.774
-- it was originally -- put

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.176
together by cal poly Pomona

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:17.479
-- when the -- operations

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:18.948
-- emergency operations

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:20.849
individual retired there she

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:23.519
continued on -- and maintaining

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.688
that Sir program we have

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:28.490
-- run some city employees

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:31.260
through Sir training -- and

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:32.661
-- that is a program that we

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.396
will pick up again -- in the

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:36.999
future -- and that's

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.534
all I have at this time

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.370
okay thank you with that --

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:43.172
sergeant are crumbling before

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:49.478
so we're actually getting

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:51.280
going to myself and so

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:53.182
on Connor -- we're gonna

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:54.850
do this together and the

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:55.851
reason why we're gonna do it

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.587
together is in LA county --

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:00.189
when it comes to emergency

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:02.091
operations emergency management

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.126
by county code the sheriff is

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:05.728
director of emergency response

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:06.595
in our county emergency

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.197
operations center and we're

01:11:08.263 --> 01:11:09.398
partnered with the office of

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:11.133
emergency management which

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.469
falls under the CEO's office and

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.337
-- office emergency management

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:17.406
-- CEOs office comes directory

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:19.274
of the director of recovery

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.744
so recovery begins at that

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.245
starts at the beginning of any

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:26.115
disaster so word cohabitating in

01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:28.517
the same building and we support

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:29.818
each other and collaborate

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:32.688
daily on -- issues within

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:35.224
the county of Los Angeles --

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.662
just an overview of --

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:41.697
LA county it's over four

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.966
thousand square miles -- the

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:45.668
residential population is

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:47.703
around ten million but giving

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:49.905
any Monday through Friday

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:52.007
depending on the time of day

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:54.309
that population could --

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.645
rise to fifteen million of just

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:58.047
with all the business in all

01:11:58.113 --> 01:11:59.581
everything going on in LA county

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:02.151
LA county has eighty eight

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:03.986
independent cities -- their

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:05.254
forty seven independent

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.689
law enforcement agencies

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:08.090
twenty two independent fire

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.459
agencies in over one hundred

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:11.927
special districts so we have

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.762
a lot going on in LA county

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.533
-- our emergency operation

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:19.435
planned for LA county we we

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:20.903
call it the -- E. R. P. R.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:23.672
acronym for the operational area

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:26.275
emergency response plan in in

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:28.277
that plan that that delegates

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.913
roles in a door -- authorities

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:32.548
-- who's in charge of our --

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.883
county -- see what the city --

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.019
sees are responsible for what

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.921
the sheriff departments OEM

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:40.222
office emergency management

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:42.324
it just outlines roles and

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.960
responsibilities in that plan it

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.529
also talks about our county

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:49.732
EOC actually has two functions

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:51.567
it is the county emergency

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:53.035
operations center for the eighty

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:55.237
eight independent cities however

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.972
it is the emergency operations

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.607
center for unincorporated

01:12:58.674 --> 01:12:59.808
areas within the county

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.644
-- and then it also Daly

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.446
talks about the roles and

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.914
responsibilities of the special

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.316
districts within the county

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:08.550
in an example of the special

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:10.085
districts would be our --

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.954
water districts are school

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.021
districts that they all have

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:14.423
a vital role when we had that

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:15.858
really bad day in LA county

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.827
-- that is a brief overview of

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.629
our Marin T. operations plan

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:22.698
or operational area emergency

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.166
response plan but within that

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.401
plan there are many annexes

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:28.937
that are added to that plan and

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:30.405
I think the topic for the days

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:32.508
evacuation during emerging --

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.376
a major earthquake in in that

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:36.044
plan there is an evacuation

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:38.947
annex M. then corporates

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:40.549
the whole operational area

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:42.718
I would say this that with

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:44.787
any plan it is only good

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:46.255
until the day that bad day

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:49.024
happens -- one of our first

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.058
priorities in our county

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.226
emergency operations center

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:53.595
in out earthquake scenario is

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:55.297
to gain situational awareness

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.065
throughout the county because

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:58.901
we do have a valuation plans

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.536
but we have to validate and

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:02.704
that that those emergency routes

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:04.940
are still viable with the

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:07.042
catastrophic earthquake we know

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.911
that over passes are gonna be

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:11.380
compromised and I do a lot

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:12.347
of earthquake preparedness

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:14.783
training for my department for

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:16.251
my partners within the county

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:18.086
and I challenge every class

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:19.354
every time I teach a class

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:20.489
especially on earthquakes like

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:22.825
challenge the class to count

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:24.326
the number of over passes they

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.428
either have to go over or under

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:29.565
leaving my class I I

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.300
my office is in east all the

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:33.235
city of east LA I live in the

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.537
city of Long Beach it is twenty

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:36.905
six miles for me to commute

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:39.508
to work it took me three days

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:41.443
to get the number right because

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:42.511
I heard something nice on the

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.746
radio and I lost count but

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.081
for me to traverse twenty six

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:47.783
miles I either have to go over

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.219
or under fifty six overpasses

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:52.588
and we know that in a

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.523
catastrophic earthquake over

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.191
passes are going to fail

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:57.826
they are designed cal tech

01:14:57.893 --> 01:15:00.596
are -- cal tech and --

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:04.600
-- how can I get

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.835
a Caltrans Caltrans they tell

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.403
us those overpasses a section

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.972
of those overpasses are designed

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.640
to fail if the earthquake

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:12.808
is big enough and the reason

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:15.244
for that is it's cheaper

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:16.478
and quicker to repair that

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.113
overpasses if we lose the whole

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.449
over pass so I challenge my

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.451
students count those overpasses

01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:23.652
in that just starts the

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:25.487
preparedness level for everybody

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.222
within the county so now I'm

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.091
gonna turn over to sit on

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:35.197
so as my colleague

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.465
from Pomona pointed out

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.868
each city is responsible for

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:41.336
their own emergency management

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:43.739
cop aspects however it's very

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:46.508
unlikely that once if in in any

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:47.776
significant amount specially and

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:50.312
earthquake dot one is impacted

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.614
and dot shockwave absolutely

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:54.449
stops at the boundary of that

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.385
city that is never going to

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.553
happen we live in a communal

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.722
society where we all have to

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:02.591
work together so even though

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:04.826
cities hop independence there

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.495
is a very strong sense of

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:08.730
collaboration between all cities

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:10.365
and the county across the mac

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:13.502
areas Bob to work together

01:16:13.568 --> 01:16:14.703
okay this starts with

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.338
preparedness initiatives where

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.073
we all reach out to each other

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.442
we all show up when one cities

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.643
actually hosting a community

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.211
preparedness event to share

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:24.947
materials even development of

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.348
these materials is done in a

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.517
very collaborative fashion thank

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:30.686
if you're preparing together we

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:33.255
need to train together the last

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:35.057
thing I want to know is the last

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.091
thing I would really want and

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:37.426
an American the county emergency

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:38.827
operations center is meeting my

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:40.929
counterpart for the very first

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:42.564
time off for a major earthquake

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.499
through our operational area

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:45.667
training and exercise during

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:47.135
committee we have created a

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:48.437
collaborative that gives us

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:49.838
all an opportunity to work

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:51.640
together towards developing

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:53.642
trainings hosting trainings

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:55.243
or exercising whether these

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:56.845
are table top exercises which

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.847
are discussion based to actual

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.148
boots on the ground scenario

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:02.050
or even an EOC activation

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:04.686
in terms of the operational area

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:06.521
Bob as Jeff up Tony mentioned

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.490
earlier we look at building

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.625
blocks okay we follow sums all

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.828
the way through so if a cities

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:14.529
impacted the need assistance

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:16.098
there are always going to reach

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:17.065
out and we're always going to

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.967
be there to help Bob in terms

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:20.335
of an event where we do have

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:21.770
a notice in advance there have

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:23.538
been instances where -- city

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:25.407
asset I'm sorry county assets

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:27.275
have been pre stage to be able

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:29.077
to assist local jurisdictions

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:33.882
one of the biggest things

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:36.451
is how do we get information

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:38.086
out to the public especially

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.688
when it's around evacuations

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:42.290
Los Angeles county uses

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:45.293
the alert LA county system tax

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.697
and of course I cannot find the

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:51.299
brochure right now what

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:52.667
the alert LA county system

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:55.170
actually does is any land

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:57.506
line is automatically registered

01:17:57.572 --> 01:17:59.875
into the system so if an

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.309
emergency happens and we have

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:02.911
to push a messaging out all land

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:04.980
lines will get that call okay

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.282
individuals can also register

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.284
their cell numbers their email

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.686
addresses and if they have

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.755
pagers pager information whether

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:14.890
they would like to receive text

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:17.059
messages and dot message can

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:18.593
be pushed out by our sheriff's

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.895
department the message can be

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:21.797
in multiple languages and it

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:23.799
also has accessibility features

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:27.903
and with the alert LA messages

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:30.172
it it is a very robust

01:18:30.238 --> 01:18:32.240
system and we can we can

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.809
push an alert message county

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:37.012
wide for we can be a surgical

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:39.381
with who gets that message we

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:41.383
can we can even draw down to

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:43.452
I can notify the Norse out it

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:44.820
north side of the street and

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:47.022
not the south side I can not

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.723
pinpoint one house and not their

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:51.259
neighbor -- we use it for all

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:53.395
emergencies and disasters --

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.597
it's extremely user friendly

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:58.733
and -- from initiating that

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.068
or making the decision that we

01:19:00.135 --> 01:19:01.670
need to push out or not -- alert

01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:03.638
message it takes about five

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:06.108
minutes to designate the area

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.876
that that messages going to type

01:19:07.943 --> 01:19:10.045
the message and hit send the

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:12.547
system will let us know how

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.783
many residents a contacted how

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:17.319
many contacts failed and then

01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:19.955
it'll also re dial each number

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:22.424
three times and let us know in

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:23.859
in actually give us a report

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:25.594
one of the drawbacks of the

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.796
system depending on if we trying

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:30.866
do a county wide message

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:32.868
because it the algorithms in

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:34.636
the computers doing it it's

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:36.138
not gonna happen immediately

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:37.806
it's gonna take hours for

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:40.108
that system to contact

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.144
ten million people however

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:43.512
we've used it in very local

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:45.147
emergencies of up to two hundred

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:47.916
thousand people in the and in

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.784
down messaging was completed

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.087
within two hours -- so it is

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:54.022
a very robust system and we're

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:55.157
really fortunate to have it

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.196
so moving on to --

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:02.664
evacuation shelters

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:04.699
receptions up centers

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.702
LA county house several most of

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:09.037
them are out our park and rec

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:11.006
facilities they have all been

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:12.908
assessed for accessibility okay

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.910
making sure that our facilities

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.379
are inclusive is a huge priority

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:19.814
it's usually the red cross that

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:21.550
takes the lead in setting up

01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:23.051
the box centers our reception

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.452
centers -- up immediately

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:25.587
offer emergency but there are

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.889
several county resources that

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:28.790
have been there whether it's

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:30.458
in an unincorporated area or

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:31.726
a city jurisdiction dot how

01:20:31.793 --> 01:20:33.662
provided services that includes

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:34.930
our department of public social

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:36.231
services department of health

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:38.366
services mental health senior

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:40.268
services programs as well as

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:42.070
our homeless services programs

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:49.044
up moving on to public education

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:51.513
there are a lot of programs

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.681
that we have heavily push

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:55.116
forward with the biggest one is

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.918
our emergency survival guides

01:20:57.118 --> 01:20:58.553
these are available in multiple

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.488
languages up fourteen languages

01:21:00.555 --> 01:21:01.756
and counting up the moment

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.526
our push really is to get

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:06.461
the community ready K. the

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.629
last thing we want is for

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.264
any resident think off okay

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:11.333
I have received evacuation

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.668
notice for any emergency up

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:14.970
for after an earthquake my home

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.271
is damage I need to relocate

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:17.472
to a shelter what should I be

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.608
taking me okay the purpose of

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:21.309
these guides are to make sure

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.278
that our residents are prepared

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:25.747
in advance the other companion

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.482
docking up booklet that we have

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:28.917
is Stacey stand control this

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:30.352
is specifically geared towards

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:31.987
people with disabilities and

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.255
others with rocks and functional

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:35.190
needs to be able to conduct a

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:36.958
self assessment on what their

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:38.260
needs are going to be during

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:40.595
any emergency our focus really

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:42.497
is all hazards because some

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:43.298
of the things that you would

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:44.599
need for one disaster would

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.368
definitely carry on to the other

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:49.904
and then as far is situational

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:51.606
analysis and damage assessment

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:52.807
like our colleague said from

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:54.843
commodity at in in LA county

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:57.012
we use the operational area

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:58.647
resource and recovery system

01:21:58.713 --> 01:22:00.715
the acronym is orders it

01:22:00.782 --> 01:22:03.118
is a web based system --

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:04.986
wars does two things for us

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.421
a four eighty eight cities

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:07.589
that incorporated areas in

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.257
our special districts it

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.293
is a tool that is used for

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.461
-- those entities to provide

01:22:13.528 --> 01:22:14.863
situational awareness to the

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.666
to the county level what

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:19.901
what their status is -- what

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:21.970
resources they need and and

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:23.638
how they're faring that is

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:24.873
one of the tools we use to

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.107
gain situational awareness

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:28.510
and to give us give me to

01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:29.911
develop a common operating

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:32.380
picture within the county --

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:39.254
so what with the wars in our

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:40.588
our partners in Amman and they

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:42.357
have a really bad day in Pomona

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:44.292
they can log in to orders

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.027
develop a situation report

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:47.729
-- we would see that in the

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.264
county and then we could follow

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:50.832
that up with phone calls and

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.233
they get it it would give them

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:53.568
the ability also if they need

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.236
resources they can request those

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:57.272
resources through wars and then

01:22:57.339 --> 01:22:58.440
we would follow that up with

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:00.375
a phone call to make sure we

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:01.876
understand the exact resource

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:03.678
requested what exactly they need

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:04.913
and then we would dispatch us

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:07.782
resources your startup growth

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:10.118
and as far so as far as drills

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:12.387
and exercises -- I I I think

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:13.288
everybody that's been up here

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:15.023
on the panel has basically

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:16.825
said we play like we practice

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:19.761
so exercising and drills

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.329
whether it's for conducting

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:23.031
a workshop going to a table

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:25.033
top to a functional tool for

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.435
skill functional -- we were

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:28.703
constantly doing that within

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.972
the county with our our city

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:32.974
partners are county departments

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.543
-- in our special districts --

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:37.412
we have an annual evacuation

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:39.381
drill into paying a canyon

01:23:39.447 --> 01:23:42.117
it's one of our big concerns --

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:45.987
in and that's a it's a fire

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.889
scenario for that particular

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:49.824
drill but in that community

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:51.693
there's only two one way at

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.994
the north in one way out of

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:55.196
the south and -- thousands

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:57.098
of residents live there -- and

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:59.467
that is an annual drill we do --

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:01.936
regarding earthquakes in LA

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:03.071
county we participate in the

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:05.173
great shakeout every year and

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.275
-- some years that that drill

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:08.676
is more elaborate than others

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:11.479
but every year the basics

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:13.648
of that exercise is we request

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:14.949
that all the city's all our

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:16.317
county departments and all our

01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:17.886
special interest rate districts

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:20.488
log in to orders and give

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.290
us a situation status report

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.926
and N. during exercise it could

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:27.429
be make believe what we are

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:28.897
we are up and functioning or

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:30.698
we are devastated but it it's

01:24:30.765 --> 01:24:32.367
that muscle memory of getting

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.702
them to use the system to for

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.337
that that situation status

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:38.406
report to the county level in

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.608
and we do that annually and

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:42.010
we have to drill together train

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:43.912
together exercise together up

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.613
dot is that as a mantra for

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.282
the entire operational area

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:50.618
that's it if you have any

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:52.420
other questions or the three

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.389
is great to hear I'm I'm really

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:55.857
pleased to to the information

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.258
but a question for approach

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:58.326
for both city put more LA

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:00.195
county talked about homeowner

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:02.931
the the community centers and

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:04.165
LA county talk about some of

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:05.500
the resource committee senator

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:06.935
at some of the park something

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:08.703
so is there already supplies

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:10.705
there at those locations in

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.240
a bit of a of a disaster okay

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.942
we go there because that's

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:16.144
the evacuation center or site

01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:18.680
clusters already stockpile of

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:21.483
supplies there for the for

01:25:21.549 --> 01:25:23.151
the city of Pomona we have some

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:25.386
supplies -- we are in the

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:28.122
process of of trying to augment

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.291
what we have on hand -- for

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:31.926
the issue we have is is finding

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:34.629
places to store those -- but

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:36.164
-- is this a going forward

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:37.999
we are going to argument

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:39.601
-- but we do have on hand

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:42.036
in the and then from the county

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:44.339
level -- as far sheltering is

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:46.374
concerned -- American red cross

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:48.009
is one of our main partners

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:50.011
in that at the county level we

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:51.212
never know exactly where that

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.515
disaster is going to be so we

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:56.618
we don't have pre

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:59.487
stays supplies at potential

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:00.989
shelters because we never know

01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:02.156
where the disaster is going

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:04.425
to be in addition to that we

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:06.895
don't know we we have lists

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.963
of potential shelters but

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.298
depending on the disaster

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:12.200
that shelter may be affected

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:13.902
the infrastructure may be

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:16.738
compromised so we do not

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:19.207
have pre stage supplies

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:21.242
at shelter potential shelter

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:23.511
locations but we do work closely

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:25.480
with red cross and once we

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:27.882
we need to activate a certain

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:29.918
sheltered then we immediately

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:32.554
dispatch -- supplies and

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.655
support to that shelter

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:36.658
when I was going out to that

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:37.525
one of the things that we

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:39.460
actually lead was up we work

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:41.262
with the American red cross --

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:42.964
for durable medical equipment

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.299
what their needs would actually

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:46.134
be we created a list with our

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.569
operational area partners we

01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:49.404
actually procured those supplies

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:51.072
Bob and they're managed by the

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:52.240
red cross but as my colleague

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:53.274
from the sure sponsored the

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:54.342
red cross is the one that

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:56.344
actually moves those assets

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:58.379
around up there not actually pre

01:26:58.446 --> 01:26:59.647
stage simply because we don't

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:00.682
know where the emergency will

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:03.384
I am done for city appoint you

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:05.687
talked about there isn't any

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:07.355
really active Sir or new Connor

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:08.656
is a certain but not really

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:09.857
so to speak it is so they're

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:11.859
looking at maybe wrapping that

01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:13.161
up somehow to make sure we

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:15.363
have the teams there as like on

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:16.798
our sister city here in Ontario

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:18.366
as of the system operating

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:20.435
wrecked it there is there is

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:22.370
a certain team -- based out of

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:24.038
Pomona but it is not a city of

01:27:24.105 --> 01:27:26.140
Pomona searching -- as I said

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:27.775
it's it's made up of independent

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:29.444
jewels from the community

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:31.045
that will really formed by

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:33.047
-- the emergency preparedness

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:35.817
person for cal poly Pomona --

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:37.452
as I said one of the things that

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:38.820
that we would like to do we have

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:41.322
train some city employees --

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:44.058
said the to the cert program --

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:46.394
in we would one of our

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:48.696
plans is to get every city

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:50.431
employee through that program

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:52.300
as well -- and hopefully

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:53.968
establish a city of Pomona

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:56.738
certain in spring of promote

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:58.006
a particular I know you made

01:27:58.072 --> 01:27:59.407
much of the beginning regarding

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.542
a year the O. C. at Brackett

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.511
field that's somewhat odd being

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:04.779
outside is actually a technique

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:06.614
city laverne so something

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:08.716
happens in in Pomona and say

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:09.951
infrastructure we talked about

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:11.052
the bridges only talk about

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:12.487
bridges right comma so many

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:14.222
bridges obviously the main

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:15.523
arteries I'm thinking about

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:17.592
in the top of my head -- Whyte

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:19.027
Avenue Gerry Avenue there's a

01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:20.628
couple the over under passes

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:22.563
right does go down so would it

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.866
be harder to get folks out to

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.768
la Verne in case infrastructures

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:28.436
down so kinda defeats the

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:29.871
purpose we have he'll see but

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:32.040
it's technically not in Pomona

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.441
it's outside the city and we

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:35.309
have to travel there in a case

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:36.878
we have that catastrophic event

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.479
were you know how we gonna get

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:39.981
there because X. one G. the

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:41.983
streets or blocked off then

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.584
what we do is our backup plan

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:46.087
the there there is -- the we

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:48.656
do have certain vehicles --

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:50.291
with the police department --

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:51.826
ex military vehicles we have a

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:54.228
a Humvee -- and then was known

01:28:54.295 --> 01:28:55.830
as a and M. rap that pretty

01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:57.265
much will climb over everything

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:58.766
if worse comes to worse we can

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:00.668
use the helicopter to -- pick

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:03.137
people up -- the -- ill

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:04.439
see used to be in the basement

01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:05.440
of fire station one eighty

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:08.009
one -- on Park Avenue --

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:11.179
unfortunately when the -- Chino

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:13.514
hills earthquake occurred --

01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:15.416
quite a few years ago now --

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:17.585
we did activate our our EOC and

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:19.387
everybody went down into the

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:21.789
basement and we determined at

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:24.792
the there's there wasn't --

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:26.728
very good air circulation there

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:28.396
was only one way in and one way

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.098
out through at the staircase

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:31.733
that that made a couple of turns

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:34.602
-- in it it -- was felt that

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:36.537
that was a somewhat inadequate

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:39.474
-- in so we we looked around

01:29:39.707 --> 01:29:41.743
and the -- the best location

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:43.177
the we could come up with was

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.879
the -- you sharing space with a

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.581
helicopter at a practice field

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:48.750
it's a one story a cinder block

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:51.486
building -- should --

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:52.887
the power go out because of an

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:54.722
earthquake it's an airport they

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:57.191
will have power -- there is

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:59.260
it run ways of emergency price

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:01.362
mercy supplies need to be flown

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:02.930
in by helicopter whatever they

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:04.499
can be brought into Brackett

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:05.566
field and then disperse from

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:07.969
that that point -- we are right

01:30:08.035 --> 01:30:08.870
across the street from the

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.172
Fairplex -- we are partnering

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.907
with the Fairplex -- is they

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:15.343
have -- -- as part of their

01:30:15.409 --> 01:30:17.078
their program that they have a

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:19.380
lot of facilities -- showers it

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:21.215
and what not that people could

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:22.917
use -- and they could also be

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:24.652
used as a an evacuation center

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:26.721
okay and not just one last

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.689
question for somebody or LA

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:30.992
county folks being were so big

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:32.393
and fast in the population over

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.796
ten million how I mean are

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.931
we really working with our local

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:37.999
cities are eighty eight cities

01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:39.367
writing we talk about the county

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:41.002
to make sure that everybody's on

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:42.136
the same page so to speak when

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:44.472
it comes to the big catastrophic

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:46.007
event cause I know sometimes

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:47.542
communication falls through the

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:48.743
cracks and people don't really

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:50.211
know everything one thing that

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.679
comes to mind we sure thing was

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:53.314
alert LA I don't even know that

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:54.849
was here now it's like wow I've

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:56.317
been put more in in telecom

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:57.518
whole life and I didn't even

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.387
know there was that -- after

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:01.289
you can sign up so how are we

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:02.323
making sure that we're getting

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:03.491
all the information out to a

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.259
regular constituents going to

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:06.694
be hard even some areas because

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:08.396
of disadvantaged communities

01:31:08.462 --> 01:31:09.831
and maybe not access to internet

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:12.099
stuff how I mean do we work

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:13.234
with our cities to try to do

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:14.969
our best to make sure that the

01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:16.037
information is out there with

01:31:16.103 --> 01:31:17.772
everybody up absolutely that's

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:19.207
actually a great question there

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:20.541
are several mechanisms that

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:22.176
we do that through up first

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.277
which would be our operational

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:24.645
or a training exercise during

01:31:24.712 --> 01:31:26.948
committee up the demon axed

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:28.382
out of my colleague from Pomona

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:29.817
referenced earlier are a part

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:31.085
of this committee as well as

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.788
cities that of that represent

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:35.056
themselves of this committee

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:36.791
this is where we plan out our

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:38.259
training and exercise calendar

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:39.360
over three years this is

01:31:39.427 --> 01:31:40.561
where we plan our operational

01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:42.730
area exercises up over a

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:45.032
two year period okay --

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:47.902
in addition to that there are

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.871
up for example on your question

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:51.272
your comment regarding alert LA

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.674
county as it turns out multiple

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:55.977
dot cities and Alec are fiercely

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:57.578
independent so cities you do

01:31:57.645 --> 01:31:59.814
have their own up emergency

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:01.549
notification system case in

01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:03.517
point Pomona actually uses Nixle

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:05.653
for load of local notifications

01:32:05.887 --> 01:32:07.088
when we actually go out for

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:09.824
community education we carry

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:11.626
a list with us to make sure

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:13.361
that the resident is getting

01:32:13.427 --> 01:32:15.730
the right information so if they

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:18.099
are resident of a city dot does

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:19.600
not how Fuller daily county to

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.435
have their own system we make

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:22.803
sure that we direct them to the

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.605
right side up at times we do

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:26.374
take laptops with us especially

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.575
when we're out senior centers

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:28.976
to make sure direct registration

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:30.845
is taking place and individuals

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.146
are registered for the court

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:33.981
Bob for the proper system now

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:35.716
the systems do have crosstalk

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.151
capability of our sheriff's

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.386
department is actually great

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:40.254
reaching out to partner agencies

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:41.923
to make sure that the correct

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:44.125
message is going out of to the

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:46.427
right areas in addition we have

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:48.496
of a group called one voice

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:49.997
intercom anytime there is an

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:51.532
incident or even if it even if

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.501
they're just training to prepare

01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:55.436
for one this one weighs group

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:57.038
actually house representation

01:32:57.104 --> 01:32:58.339
from county departments as

01:32:58.406 --> 01:32:59.840
well as external partners up

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:01.375
throughout the operational area

01:33:01.642 --> 01:33:03.511
and we make sure we are putting

01:33:03.577 --> 01:33:06.414
out one of accepted

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.982
message nobody is pushing

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:09.517
out conflicting information

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:12.787
when you said that and we talked

01:33:12.853 --> 01:33:14.655
about the fires here in northern

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:16.457
California in the napa area and

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:17.191
I think there was some of the

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:19.427
issues because some individual

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:21.228
cities have their own evacuation

01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:23.197
alert systems and the counties

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:24.732
had difference in that were

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:26.834
the conflict because nobody was

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:27.868
really communicating they're

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:29.337
pretty messages out someone

01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:31.372
someone were in some weren't

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.507
so there's just conflicting

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:35.910
so hopefully that we don't do

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:37.144
things like that oversee it

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:38.846
in this part of the state what

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:40.147
our system that we have that

01:33:40.514 --> 01:33:42.116
maybe there's a unified plan

01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:43.384
how we everybody's on the same

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.486
page right regardless of what

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:48.022
alert system you have that when

01:33:48.089 --> 01:33:49.090
something happens that were

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:50.358
are alerting the folks that

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:51.993
we need to alert regardless of

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:53.961
what system you're on yes Sir

01:33:55.062 --> 01:33:56.263
so with that said I want to

01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:58.265
thank you for bringing your

01:33:58.332 --> 01:33:59.600
information for to without the

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:01.168
concludes our portion of our

01:34:01.235 --> 01:34:03.838
panels so now I would like to

01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:05.439
invite members of the public if

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:06.540
there's any that would like to

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.909
come forward to for a a two

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.344
minutes at a time to share

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:12.146
any information if there's

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:13.447
anybody out there in the public

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:17.351
I think you can come forty here

01:34:17.418 --> 01:34:19.220
to the to the from your to the

01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:22.623
the the podium in the front

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:31.298
good question I'm gonna mark

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:33.567
Casey from Chino from what I'm

01:34:33.634 --> 01:34:34.602
hearing from Chino when I'm

01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:36.237
hearing from there it sounds

01:34:36.303 --> 01:34:38.172
like they'll have some shelters

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:40.307
and some resources available

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:42.343
but they can't take in everyone

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:45.546
so I'm assuming for the

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:47.882
cities in the county guys would

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:49.450
you rather we have someplace in

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:51.052
place and we hunkered down at

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:53.687
home a listing of our house is

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:56.290
really in bad shape actually so

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:58.626
that we don't flood the

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:01.128
shelters you don't have water

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:02.530
and food for all this right

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:05.833
okay broach the yes

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.004
the grocery of some from

01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:10.938
somebody in here that

01:35:11.005 --> 01:35:11.939
would hopefully give

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:12.940
us some insight to that

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:18.846
okay yes ma'am so again Daniel

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.448
millions from the county of

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:22.383
San Bernadino emergency --

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:23.984
office of emergency services

01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:26.287
so for your particular city you

01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:28.522
actually have -- any emergency

01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:30.458
manager and the reason I know

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:31.325
that is because she used to

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:32.593
work for our department she

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:33.794
was recently hired by your

01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:35.696
city so you have a full time

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:37.798
emergency manager and so the

01:35:37.865 --> 01:35:40.701
city of Chino has their own --

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:43.771
he -- shelter plans in place

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:46.107
so we would augment that

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:47.341
should they be needed by the

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:48.709
city of Chino so the way our

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:50.678
process works if there's a a

01:35:50.744 --> 01:35:52.680
van that impacts your local

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:55.249
area -- the the city of

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:57.651
Chino would provide services

01:35:58.119 --> 01:35:59.587
to the point where they can

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:02.456
-- they might not have the

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:03.958
resources needed then they would

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:05.292
reach out to us at the county

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:06.961
level then we would come in and

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:08.529
augment those services whatever

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.698
they may be but my question

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:12.266
is shouldn't high have something

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:14.568
in place so that I can stay

01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:16.637
at my home whether it's inside

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:19.006
or outside June I have some

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:21.242
bad in some extra clothing some

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:24.211
food so that you don't

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:25.813
have to bring in extra mean

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.014
if I can stay there wouldn't

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:28.415
you rather me stay at my home

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:30.451
rather than run to shelter yes

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:32.153
ma'am absolutely a we encourage

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:34.655
all of our residents to -- take

01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:36.423
preparedness efforts -- which

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:37.892
will include not only items for

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:39.226
yourself and your loved ones

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:40.895
but also what we encourage is

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:42.429
for folks to think about things

01:36:42.496 --> 01:36:44.665
like their pets -- and things

01:36:44.732 --> 01:36:46.433
of that nature anything that

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.035
residents can do to be self

01:36:48.102 --> 01:36:51.105
sufficient will greatly --

01:36:51.172 --> 01:36:53.574
-- enhance our efforts in in

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.009
the recovery response phase

01:36:55.075 --> 01:36:56.877
of thing so the less folks we

01:36:56.944 --> 01:36:58.646
have to worry about the better

01:36:58.712 --> 01:36:59.747
the response is going to be

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:01.549
for the over arching approach I

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:03.951
think most people think you're

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:05.786
going to take care of them we

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:08.189
don't need to tell me

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:09.723
if I watched my neighborhood my

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.392
family my friends my neighbors

01:37:11.725 --> 01:37:12.860
there's very few of us that

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:14.395
have kids in place they think

01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:16.063
you're going to take care of but

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:17.364
I think they need to learn the

01:37:17.431 --> 01:37:19.300
opposite you need to take care

01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:21.368
of yourself first and if you

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:23.003
absolutely can't we're here for

01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:24.939
you I I agree with that ma'am

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.942

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:29.009
I was just wanted to get back

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:30.010
with that ma'am I'm sorry to

01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:31.579
get your name but I think now

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:33.314
more than ever we need to vice

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.282
are or -- cities and really

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.351
are a residents that if the big

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:38.886
winner cursed to be prepared

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:40.688
right there should be a list of

01:37:40.754 --> 01:37:42.056
things you should have at home

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:44.425
the clothes extra clothing food

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:45.859
medication sub but people don't

01:37:45.926 --> 01:37:47.595
talk about some medications a

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:48.929
lot of our structure orderly

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:50.631
folks arm some medical

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:51.699
conditions and need to have

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.567

some information on my website

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:55.836

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.114
