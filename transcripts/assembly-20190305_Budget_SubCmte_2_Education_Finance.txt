AND SOME RELIEF TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THEIR PENSION COSTS -- WE KNOW BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING. RIGHT HERE IN MY BACKYARD WHERE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL AND ONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS INVOLVED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THAT -- YOU KNOW SCHOOLS ARE HAVING A TOUGH TIME AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE THIS YEAR THE ADEQUATE LET THING FOR OUR SCHOOL TO GO TEACHER AND SO FOR TWO THAT TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AS WELL AS THE HEARINGS THROUGHOUT -- THIS SPRING -- WITH THAT WE WENT TO INVITE UP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- LA JOH IN DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. TO TALK ABOUT OUR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR OKAY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AARON AND AREA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TODAY I'M GOING TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN OVERVIEW. ON THE CALCULATION OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEED ALONG WITH THE SPENDING THAT'S PROPOSED WITH IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. A SPENDING PLAN. SO FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE GUARANTEE THE BUDGET PROPOSES THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FUNDING EVER UNDER THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEEING. AT EIGHTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS UP FROM SEVENTY SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN END UP FROM FORTY SEVEN BILLION DURING THE TROUGH OF THE RECESSION. WITH CONTINUED REVENUE GROWTH DURING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM THE GREAT RECESSION TOTAL GENERAL FUND REVENUES AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE ESTIMATED. TO BE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AN INCREASE OF FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS. AT A TOTAL OF EIGHTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A PER PEOPLE EXPENDITURE FROM PROP. NINETY EIGHT OF JUST OVER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AN INCREASE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER PEOPLE OVER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS. AS NOTED -- EXCUSE ME I HAVE. A COUPLE OF HAND OUTS HERE ONE HAND UP IF. GIVEN TO THEM. SORRY ABOUT THAT -- AND THEN. SO I WAS GOING TO REFER TO THE HAND OUT THAT'S WHAT REMINDED ME -- IN FIGURE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT ON THE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE PAGE. ARE YOU CAN SEE THAT FUNDED LEVELS IN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN DECLINE FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT LEVELS BY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION AND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS RESPECTIVELY. DUE LARGELY TO LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE AND YEAR OVER YEAR DECLINE IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE GROWTH FROM SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN COMPARED AGAIN TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. WELL GENERAL FUND REVENUES ARE INCREASED ACROSS THE BUDGET WINDOW COMPARED TO THE BUDGET ACT THE YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE INCREASE OF TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN COMPARED TO TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. AS WE GO TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HAS THE EFFECT OF LIMITING GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AS OPPOSED TO IF REVENUES HAD INCREASED BY MORE THAN TWO POINT NINE IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE ANTICIPATE THAT ANY GROWTH IN REVENUES IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BEYOND APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. IN NINETEEN NINETEEN AS WE WOULD SWITCH TO ATTEST TO WHERE THE THE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT THAT IS APPLIED TO THE GUARANTEES ON A FUNCTION OF PER CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME AND NOT GENERAL FUND REVENUES THEREFORE ANY DECREASE IN REVENUES IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHAT ALSO SEE PROP NINETY EIGHT LOSE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR EVERY DOLLAR IN LOST REVENUES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FOR THE REVENUE INCREASES OR DECREASES AT THE MAY REVISION. WHAT IMPACT THE GUARANTEE BY ABOUT FORTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR AS WE ARE EXPECTING TO BE AN A TEST ONE GEAR -- ALSO AT THE MAY REVISION EVEN WITH POTENTIAL OTHER FACTOR CHANGES. BECAUSE THERE'S NO LONGER ANY OUTSTANDING MAINTENANCE FACTOR BALANCE AS OUR HOUSE OFTEN BEEN IN PREVIOUS BUDGETS. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WILL LIKELY NOT BE A SENSITIVE TO CHANGES PARTICULARLY INCREASES IN GENERAL FUND REVENUES AS IT HAS BEEN IN RECENT YEARS WITH THE NON PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND SIDE OF THE BUDGET THIS TIME STANDING TO GAIN PROPORTIONATELY MORE FROM REVENUE INCREASES THAN IT HAS IN PREVIOUS BUDGETS. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET MAKES THE FINAL PAYMENT TOWARDS OUTSTANDING SETTLE IT BALANCES -- TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. OF SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SO. K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION WILL NOT EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN PRIOR OR CURRENT YEAR APPROPRIATIONS DESPITE DECLINES IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AMOUNTS BECAUSE ONE WE ARE MAINTAINING. A FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR OVER APPROPRIATIONS TO THE PROPOSITION NINETY MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWO WE ARE STE USING SETTLE UP PAYMENTS TO OFFSET. OTHERWISE UNFUNDED EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OBLIGATIONS WHICH I'LL DISCUSS IN A MOMENT AS WELL. OUT SOME OF OUR MAJOR K. TWELVE SPENDING PROPOSALS WHICH YOU CAN ALSO SEE ON THAT HAND OUT. OUR IN EARLY EDUCATION THE BUDGET SHOULD PROPOSES TO SHIFT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR PART A PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS A NON LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. TO NON PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND. TO ALLOW FOR NON LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY PROVIDERS TO DRAW DOWN FULL DAY FOR YOUR REIMBURSEMENT FROM A SINGLE FUNDING SOURCE. AND TO PROVIDE THEM WITH FLEXIBILITY TO BEING BETTER USE OF THEIR CONTRACT FUNDING. EN EL CFF THE BUDGET BUILDS ON PREVIOUS IS A INVESTMENTS SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN INTO THE LC A PFAFF WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWO BILLION DOLLARS AS THE CHAIR NOTED. IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY AS A COLA TO THE TARGET FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS BRINGING THE TOTAL OF INCREASE FUNDING SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF ELSE ABOUT.

JUST OVER SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS AS SHOWN IN FIGURE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO USE APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF OUTSTANDING SETTLE AT PAYMENTS. TO FIND OUT IF OF AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IN ORDER TO AVOID HAVING TO MAKE CURRENT YOUR CUTS TO SCHOOLS AS A RESULT OF THE MINIMUM YEAR. MINIMUM GUARANTEE DECREASING AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THE BUDGET INCLUDES A SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL USING BOTH ON GOING AT ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS. THREE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION OF WHICH ARE. ONGOING AND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION OF WHICH ARE [inaudible] ONE TIME. THIS FUNDING WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT EXPANDED SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND SCHOOL READINESS SUPPORTS AT LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES WITH HIGH PERCENTAGES OF BOTH STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND UNDEFEATED PUPILS.

WORKFORCE AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEMS. WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU WILL -- PROCEED WITH THEIR LA -- AND THEN DEPARTMENT OF ADD BEFORE WE A HAVE QUESTIONS BUT LET'S JUST TAKE THE ROLL OVER -- HERE REAL QUICK [inaudible] MCCARTY HERE [inaudible] PRO. GALLAGHER. LOW MOAN. ANNA YOUR FIRST TO CHEER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU I AM. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KENNETH COUPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT THE SERGEANT DISTRIBUTED EARLIER. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR MOVING PIECES IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I THINK -- IRAN'S PRESENTATIONS ALSO A TIMELY REMINDER THAT WILL NEARLY A DOZEN INPUTS AFFECT THE CALCULATION OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT IN THIS YEAR AND MOST OTHER YEAR IS ARE THE YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGES IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE. GROWTH IN THE STATE ECONOMY AND CHANGES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE. AS A TURNING TO PAGE ONE OF OUR HAND OUT AS N PREVIOUS YEARS THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IN THE CURRENT YEAR HAS MOVED QUITE A BIT. SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE STATE BUDGET HAS DROPPED SINCE LAST JUNE A SCHOOL FUNDING RIGHT NOW IS FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ABOVE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AND AS YOU HEARD EARLIER THEY ADMINISTRATION AS A PROPOSAL TO RE CLASSIFY THAT FUNDING ABOUT THE GUARANTEE. AS A PAYMENT TOWARD SOME PRIOR FISCAL YEAR IS. AND THAT SIGNIFICANT BOTH BECAUSE IT AVOID THIS -- MID YEAR CUTS AND PAYMENT DEFERRALS SO IT'S UP MORE STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY FOR SCHOOLS. IT ALSO KEEPS THAT FUNDING FROM BECOMING PART OF THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING NEXT YEAR'S GUARANTEE SO IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND SUBSEQUENT BUDGETS. I TURNING TO PAGE TWO OF OUR HAND OUT AS YOU FOR THE MINISTRATION SAY -- THE GUARANTEE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD GROW THREE POINT 6% IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND YOU PROBABLY I RECOGNIZE THAT AS BEING A BIT LOWER THAN WHAT. WE'VE SEEN IN SOME PREVIOUS YEAR IS A LOT OF THAT PREVIOUS GROWTH HAD TO DO WITH THIS CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE STATE TO A STORY SCHOOL FUNDING FOR INCREASES IT DIDN'T PROVIDE DURING THE RECESSION YEARS. AND THE STATE AS OF LAST YEAR HAS NO FINISHED MAKING THOSE RESTORATION PAYMENTS AND SO SCHOOL FUNDING IS LIKELY TO GROW. MORE SLOWLY MOVING FORWARD. EVEN IF WE HAVE A VERY STRONG ECONOMY LIKE THE ONE RIGHT NOW. I THINK THIS YEAR'S BUDGET GIVES YOU A GOOD FLAVOR OF WHAT THAT. KIND OF NEW GROWTH WILL LOOK LIKE I WITH GROWTH MORE IN THE RANGE OF 324% COMPARED WITH SIX OR 7% IN PREVIOUS YEARS. THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO WAS UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE I WE CAN COVER THAT IN MORE DETAIL IF YOU'RE INTERESTED -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE I REASONABLE ACROSS THE ENTIRE THREE YEAR BUDGET PERIOD OF THEIR OUR ESTIMATES -- THE IN BELOW ARE IS STILL QUITE CLOSE MUCH CLOSER EVEN THAN IN SOME PREVIOUS YEARS. TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF THIS IS LARGELY JUST A RECAP OF ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PROPOSALS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. I WON'T COVER ANY OF THESE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I THINK OF YOU ALL OF THEM AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS. WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PACKAGE IS JUST HOW MUCH OF THE NEW SPENDING IS DEDICATED TO COVERING THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT -- WE ESTIMATE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN NET NEW SPENDING. ACROSS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OF THAT AMOUNT TWO AND A HALF BILLION IS DEDICATED TO COVERING A THREE AND A HALF HALF PERCENT COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. SO THAT REALLY MAKES THIS FOR A OF A STRAIGHT FORWARD BUDGET. TEN WITH MUCH FEWER NEW PROPOSALS THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN SOME PRIOR YEARS. TURNING TO PAGE FOR I THINK A LITTLE HISTORICAL REVIEW MIGHT HELP BUT THE BUDGET IN CONTEXT. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SCHOOL FUNDING WOULD BE TWELVE THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS PER PUPIL IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AN INCREASE OF THREE POINT 8% OVER THE REVISED TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVEL. DUE IN LARGE PART TO A VERY LONG ECONOMIC EXPANSION THIS IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FUNDING THE STATE HAS EVER PROVIDED. ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION A SCHOOL FUNDING IS FIVE HUNDRED PER STUDENT ABOVE THE PREVIOUS PEAK IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE AND ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED ABOVE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT A PREVIOUS SESSION LEVEL. A TURNING TO PAGE FIVE WE SOMETIMES LOOK BEYOND OUR OWN BORDERS TO SEE HOW CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SPENDING COMPARES WITH OTHER STATES. THIS IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFICULT COMPARISON BECAUSE YOU'RE. LOOKING AT NOT JUST VERY DECISIONS BUT ALSO THE DECISION STATE YOUR IS AFFECTING THOSE RANKINGS. ARE THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE FOR SPENDING COMPARISONS COMES FROM THE US CENSUS BUREAU. THE MAIN DRAWBACK OF THEIR DATA IS THAT IT TENDS TO LAKE A COUPLE YEARS AND SO ANY TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RANKINGS WERE ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT BEHIND THE TIMES. WE DO REALIZE THAT SOME OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SOMETIMES PRODUCE THEIR OWN SPENDING RANKINGS -- BUT WOULDN'T LEAVE EXAMINE THOSE ESTIMATES WE TEND TO FIND THEM LESS RELIABLE IN A LITTLE BIT LESS CONSISTENT THAN WHAT THE CENSUS BUREAU PUTS FORWARD. SO AS A FIFTEEN SIXTEEN LATEST YEAR WE HAVEN'T LEADERSHIP WE HAVE DATA CALIFORNIA RANKS TWENTY THIRD IN PER PUPIL SPENDING AMONG THE FIFTY STATES AND DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. SOME ORGANIZATIONS THOUGH TRY TO GO FURTHER AND TRY TO ADJUST THAT CENSUS BUREAU DATA FOR THE REGIONAL VARIATION THAT WE SEE IN COST ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA IS RELATIVELY HIGH COST STATE. THINGS TEND TO COST MORE HERE WE TEND TO HAVE HIGHER WAGES AND SO THOSE ADJUSTMENTS TEND TO RESULT IN CALIFORNIA DROPPING. THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE RELIABLE ACOSTA JUST THE DATA -- FOR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BUT OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS THAT ONCE THAT DATA DO BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE COMING MONTHS CALIFORNIA WILL PROBABLY RANK IN THE MID THIRTIES ON THAT COST ADJUSTED DATA. I THINK THE STATE COMPARISONS ARE ALSO REMINDER OF JUST HOW VOLATILE I SPENDING IS COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. FROM 200-078-22000 TEN ELEVEN SCHOOL SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA DROPPED MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE AND FROM 200-010-1122 THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IT GREW FASTER THAN ANY OTHER STATE. SO SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TO BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO A LOT MORE SWINGSAND SPENDING COMPARED TO SOME OTHER STATES. AT THE TURNING TO PAGE SIX I'D LIKE TO SHIFT FROM A LOOK BACK TO LOOK AHEAD AND WHAT THE MAY REVISION MIGHT HOLD IN STORE FOR YOU. ON BALANCE WE THINK THERE'S A BIT MORE DOWNSIDE AN UPSIDE THIS YEAR AS PART AS POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. A PART OF THAT STORY HAS TO DO WITH REVENUE AS I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW THE STOCK MARKET DROPS NOTABLY AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THAT DROP HAPPENED AFTER THE POINT WITH THE pADMINISTRATION TYPICALLY LOCKS DOWN ITS ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS. A STOCK MARKET HAS MADE UP A LOT OF GROUND SINCE THEN BUT WE STILL THINK WE COULD SEE SOME LOWER REVENUE PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT YEAR. WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME SIGNS THAT THE ECONOMY MIGHT BE SLOWING A TOUCH. SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE WE'VE HAD A SMALL UPTICK IN UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS RECENTLY AND AS WELL AS A SMALL DOWN TAKEN HOME SALES. AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IS SENSITIVE TO OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES. FOR THE ADMINISTRATION STATE EARLIER FOR EACH DOLLAR BUT FIFTY FIVE CENTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND ABOUT FORTY CENTS IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY THE OTHER PART OF THE STORY IS THAT WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETING EXCLUDE SOME COSTS THAT ARE LIKELY TO MATERIALIZE IN THE COMING MONTHS. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS RELATED TO A KIND OF A ONE TIME PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL IN SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S REALLY A KIND OF A CORRECTION OF SOME PREVIOUS PROPERTY TAX CALCULATIONS AND FROM PRIOR YEARS. WE ALSO THINK THAT SOME OF YOUR FORMULA DRIVEN SPENDING PUTTING SPENDING AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IT'S LIKELY TO BE A BIT HIGHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES. YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT ALL OF THESE ISSUES AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS BUT IN TOTAL ACROSS ALL OF THE ISSUES YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. WE THINK THOSE X. ADDITIONAL COSTS MIGHT BE IN THE RANGE OF A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AT THE BETWEEN A LOWER MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND HIGHER COSTS WE THINK YOU'RE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET COULD BE TIGHTER BY MAY. I TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN WE THINK YOU HAVE A COUPLE OPTIONS TO THINK ABOUT TO BEGIN PREPARING FOR THOSE POTENTIAL CHANGES. ONE IS TO USE THE COMING MONTHS TO IDENTIFY PROPOSALS THAT YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO REJECT OR PERHAPS REDUCE OF REVENUE COMES IN LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED. IF YOU WOULD IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE THINGS NOW THAT'S GOING TO MAKE. THE MAJOR REVISION -- CHANGES FOR YOU A LITTLE BIT EASIER. BUT WE ALSO THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BUILDING. I SING SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ONGOING SPENDING I WITH ONE TIME INITIATIVES RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS VIRTUALLY NO. SPENDING BUILT INTO THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET THAT'S ONE TIME. AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A RISKIER APPROACH COMPARED TO SOME PREVIOUS YEAR IT'S BECAUSE THE FUNDING DROPS EITHER NOW OR PERHAPS IN A YEAR. YOU HAVE FEWER THINGS THAT YOU CAN REDUCE WITHOUT. WE THINK THAT BUILDING IN A LITTLE BIT MORE ONE TIME FUNDING WOULD -- POSITION YOU BETTER TO ADDRESS ANY DROPS THAT HAPPENED BY NAME. ABOUT SO TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT TELL JUST ADDRESS ONE FINAL COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY PACKAGE. AT WHICH IS HOW THE STATE ADDRESSES CHANGES IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE THAT OCCUR AFTER THE YEAR IS OVER. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS REALLY KIND OF A UNIQUE -- PART OF STATE BUDGET AND NETWORK IT'S NOT EVEN FINAL ONCE THE YEAR AND WE HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER NINE MONTHS AFTER THE END OF THE YEAR AT LEAST TO GET FINAL DATA -- THOSE CHANGES HAPPENING AFTER THE YEAR IS OVER CAN BE IN THE RANGE OF A FEW OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO IN SOME CASES LOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. AT TRADITIONALLY WHEN THE GUARANTEE IS HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE THE STATE MAKES A ONE TIME PAYMENT TO SETTLE UP TO THAT HIGHER FUNDING LEVEL. AND WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS BELOW THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE THE STATE TENDS TO REDUCE SCHOOL FUNDING TO THE LOWER LEVEL. AND THE STATE USUALLY MAKES THAT REDUCTION BY CLASSIFYING SOME FUNDING ABOUT THE GUARANTEE IS BEING RELATED TO A PRIOR FISCAL YEAR A YEAR WHERE IT HASN'T ALREADY MET THE GUARANTEE -- THAT APPROACH LET'S SCHOOLS KEEP THE FUNDING THEY WERE ALREADY PLANNING TO RECEIVE -- BUT IT RECOGNIZES THE LOWER BASE FOR CALCULATING HE MINIMUM GUARANTEED MOVING FORWARD AND THE FACT THAT I'M DESCRIBING IS EXACTLY WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR. A LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CREATED A NEW TRUCK PROCESS TO TRY TO AUTOMATE THOSE UPWARD AND DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS. AT THIS WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE GUARANTEE AND THE ASSOCIATED FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS A LITTLE BIT MORE PREDICTABLE A LITTLE BIT LESS DISRUPTIVE FOR BOTH SCHOOLS AND THE STATE. A TURNING TO PAGE NINE THE GOVERNOR HAS TO PROPOSALS RELATED TO DROPS. HE'S PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE THE AUTOMATIC PROCESS COULD LAST YEAR. AND TO PROHIBIT THE STATE FOR MAKING GET WELL FUNDING IN THE PRIOR YEAR WILL STILL REQUIRE AN UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS -- WE THINK THAT -- IF YOU ADOPT THOSE PROPOSALS YOU WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE COMMITTING TO HAVING ANY DROPS IN STATE REVENUE. IN THE PRIOR YEAR FALL ENTIRELY ON THE NONPROFIT THIS NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE BUDGET. AND WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR OVERALL BUDGET MORE DIFFICULT TO BALANCE. A BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND POTENTIALLY IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS TO AND THAT'S BECAUSE FUNDING ABOVE THE GUARANTEE AND ONE YEAR BECOMES PART OF THAT BASE FOR CALCULATING THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE THE NEXT YEAR. AND SO FOR BOTH OF THOSE REASONS WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND PRESERVE YOUR FLEXIBILITY. TO FIND OUT THE GUARANTEE OR SOME OTHER LEVEL IF THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE. THAT'S THE TURNING TO PAGE TEN I'D LIKE TO TRANSITION TO THE OTHER HALF OF YOUR AGENDA. EVERYTHING I JUST TOLD YOU RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET -- BUT THE NEXT FEW PAGES COVER YOUR EARLY EDUCATION BUDGET THIS YEAR. AND UNLIKE WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU THIS PART OF YOUR BUDGET IS ALMOST ENTIRELY OUTSIDE OF PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT SO THE CHART ON PAGE TEN JUST LIST THE PROPOSALS IN THIS YEAR'S EARLY EDUCATION -- BUDGET AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS IT'S A MIX OF ONE TIME INITIATIVES AND NEW ON GOING COMMITMENTS. TURNING TO PAGE ELEVEN THE LARGEST PROPOSAL IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANTS. AND THIS BUILDS UPON SOME FUNDING YOU ALLOCATED THIS COURAGE DISTRICTS TO CONVERT THEIR PART TAKEN THE GARDEN PROGRAMS TO FULL DAY PROGRAMS. IN REVIEWING THE APPLICATIONS THAT THE STATE'S RECEIVED SO FAR -- WE'VE CONCLUDED THAT THE CLINTON GRANTS DON'T SEEM TO BE ADVANCING YOUR CORE OBJECTIVE MOST OF THE APPLICANTS APPLYING FOR THIS FUNDING ARE ARE ALREADY RUNNING FULL DAY PROGRAMS ARE NOT APPLYING TO CONVERT TO RUN MORE. MORE OF THOSE PROGRAMS. AND SO IN SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS YOU'LL HEAR US LAY OUT SOME ALTERNATIVES. THAT COULD PROVIDE STRONGER INCENTIVES FOR FULL DAY PROGRAMS AT A LOWER COST IN THE MEANTIME WE RECOMMEND YOU HOLD OFF AND NOT PROVIDE THE PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL CAN GUARDED GRANTS AT THIS POINT. AND SO WITH THAT LET ME TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO TAKE US THROUGH THE FINAL -- PARTS OF OUR HAND OUT. GOOD MORNING SERRA CORTEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I'LL I WILL DISCUSS THE REMAINDER OF PAGE ELEVEN OF YOUR HAND OUT WHICH IS CHILD CARE AND OUR ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. SO ON THE SECOND BOLD ITEM OF PAGE -- ELEVEN IS WITH REGARDS TO THE ONE TIMEFUNDING THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FOR WORK FORCE AND FACILITY PURPOSE SAYS. I'M IN WE GIVEN THE LACK OF DATA -- AVAILABLE ON WORKFORCE AND FACILITY ISSUES WE THINK MAKING OF PRIORITIZING A ONE TIME CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL FUNDING IN THIS AREA IS CHALLENGING ON THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT SOME KEY INFORMATION IS COMING IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO AND THERE COULD ALSO BE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE. MAY WANT -- TO HAVE BEFORE IMPLEMENTING A TARGET ISSUES WITH HER -- IN AND IN SPECIFIC REGIONS. A WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATOR THE LEGISLATURE SATISFIED SOME OF THE FUNDING AND ALLOCATED IN FUTURE YEARS AS IT GETS BETTER INFORMATION. UNDER THE THIRD BULLET HERE IS WITH REGARDS TO THE PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION -- THE GOVERNOR ADDS TEN THOUSANDS PRESCHOOL SLOTS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND WE THINK THIS -- EXPANSION IS QUITE AMBITIOUS -- THERE'S MANY LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES FROM STATE ADMINISTRATION AND ON THE PROVIDER LEVEL -- ON THAT -- THAT AND WE SUGGESTS A SLOWER RAMP UP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES. AND THE LAST THE FINAL BULLET HERE IS WITH REGARDS TO ELIMINATING THE WORK REQUIREMENT FOR FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL SO UNDER CURRENT LAW PART A STEEPER SCHOOL DOESN'T HAVE A WORK REQUIREMENT AND FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL DOES -- WE THINK THAT THIS ELIMINATING THIS REQUIREMENT COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES -- THAT. AND AND HERE'S TO SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES THAT WE HIGHLIGHT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF THE PROGRAM -- AS A FULL DAY COST A FULL DAY SLOT COSTS OVER TO OF OVER TWO TIMES THE COST OF A PART DAIS THOUGHT -- AND ABSENT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THE PROGRAM COULD RESULT IN FEWER OVERALL CHILDREN AS WELL AS FEWER CHILDREN FROM WORKING FAMILIES BEING SERVED UP WITH WE RECOMMEND REJECTING -- ELIMINATING THE WORK REQUIREMENT PROPOSAL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS -- NICK SCHWEITZER DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO OUR OUR CHIEF DEPUTY -- LUPITA CORTEZ OUT CLOUT WILL BE HERE LATER AND TALK A BIT ABOUT THE THAT SUPERMAN'S PRIORITIES -- FOR NEXT YEAR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION SO I'M GONNA FOCUS MORE ON JUST SORT OF WHAT THE THE KEY POINTS WE WE SEE IN THE GOV. SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED OVERALL AND IN THE STRONG INVESTMENTS PROPOSED PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR EDUCATION THE PLEASE THAT HE'S. DOING WE ARE MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS BOTH K. TWELVE AN EARLY ED IN A WAY THAT'S PRUDENT AND SUSTAINABLE -- AND OVERALL THAT HE'S YO FOCUSES BUDGET ON THE HELPING% CALIFORNIANS WHO WHO. NEED IT MOST -- IN PARTICULAR THE THE AREA OF K. -- TWELVE FULLY FUNDING THE L. C. F. F. FORMULA AND THE COAL IS IS VERY IMPORTANT -- BREED NERO IS WELL AS THE INVESTMENTS IN IN -- SPECIAL EDUCATION -- AND THEN THE NOT NOT TO BE -- DISCOUNTED CHARLIE THE THERE IS A INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE DOORS COSTS AND ALSO HIS IS -- DESIRE TO TO SELL -- COSTS THAT THAT LOCAL DISTRICTS EXPERIENCE THAT DETRACT FROM WHAT INVESTMENTS THEY CAN MAKE IN IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM SO THOSE THOSE ARE AS CRITICAL AS ANY -- ON THE EARLY EDUCATION SIDE. HERE AGAIN THE THE FOCUS ON THE WHOLE CHILD JUST IN THE BUDGET IN GENERAL NOT JUST INVESTMENTS IN. EARLY ED BUT ALSO IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SIDE OF THE BUDGET ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR SUPPORTING -- THE AGE EDUCATIONAL PAYMENT IN IN THE EARLY YEARS AND AND THROUGHOUT -- CHILD'S -- SCHOOL EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION. AND THE UNDERLYING ANY EXPANSION IN EARLY IT HAS TO BE SYSTEMS BUILDING SO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES AND AND WORKFORCE TRAINING FOR FOR EIJI EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDERS -- SO YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY AGREE THAT ALL THESE PARTIES ARE ARE NECESSARY TO THE MORE CHILDREN CAN GET HEALTHY START THAT PREPARES THEM FOR HIGHER READ AND FOR THE WORK FORCE. TO LOOK -- FOR AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN AND BUILDING UPON THESE PROPOSALS. OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THROW A INCREASING THE RESOURCES THAT. SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES HAVE TO TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS AND OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU. OKAY ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS NOW FROM OUR SISTER DONNA. YES SO THIS QUESTION THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS VERY THOROUGH YEAH THIS QUESTIONS REALLY FOR ANYBODY YOU MAY NOT HAVE IT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY. BUT THIS IS JUST DO WE HAVE ANY DATA RELATIVE TO THE PER STUDENT EXPENDITURES TO REGARD TO SPECIAL ED. NONE OF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD I IMAGINE NOT OFF THE TOP OF OUR HEAD WE CAN GET THAT TO YOU ARE HI I HAD THE DATA DO SO A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEAR IS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED WITH DISABILITIES. HOVERED JUST BELOW 11% FOR A VERY LONG TIME FOR DECADES AND IT'S STARTED ACCELERATING ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO AND IT'S BEEN GROWING AT A MUCH FASTER THAN INFLATION THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. METICULOUS EARLY THE COSTS HAVE BEEN GOING UP BECAUSE MANY OF THE STUDENTS NEWLY IDENTIFIED WITH DISABILITIES ARE IN SORT OF HIGH COST AREAS THINGS LIKE AUTISM. AND SO THAT'S BEEN KIND OF A SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURE FOR DISTRICTS AS ACCOMMODATING THOSE HIGHER SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS. YEAH IT HAS AN IMPACT ON THEM. ON THE MONEY SPENT ON NON SPECIAL ED STUDENTS TO THANK YOU KNOW JUST THIS WILL DO THIS PRIME MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A QUESTION BUT I JUST KIND OF WORRY ABOUT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE I SEE ON HERE SOME OF THE DISCUSSION HERE. BECAUSE AGAIN IT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS BEING CREATED AS A CEILING. NOT A FLOOR -- WITH SOME OF THE DISCUSSION -- SOME THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN PROPOSITION NINETY A GUARANTEE A SENSITIVE TO LOWER REVENUE ESTIMATES WE CAN HAVE. LOWER REVENUE WE GET STILL COMMIT. TO YOUR FUNDING ARE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM ABOVE. THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IT'S REALLY WILL IS THERE THE POLITICAL WILL WITHIN THIS BODY TO DO THAT. AND I'M NOT I DON'T NEED YOU TO COMMENT ON THAT BUT AGAIN I JUST WORK SOME OF SPEAKER BUYS INTO THIS. THIS THIS MANTRA THAT'S KIND OF BEEN. SATURATED IN INFUSED INTO THE THING HERE I HAVE A JEEP PROPOSITION ANYWHERE THEY GOT MORE THAN NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THAN THAN THAN THAN THAT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT'S A PROBLEM NO THAT'S A GOOD THING -- BECAUSE IT'S TO SPEAK TO THE INVESTMENT OUR CHILDREN IS THE INVESTMENT A FUTURIST EIGHT I THINK THIS THIS COMMITTEE REALLY THIS YEAR AND IS IT NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT THAT. WE SHOULD NOT. BE SET UP FOR THAT TYPE OF THINKING WE SHOULD NOT JUST SIT DOWN. AND WE SHOULD NOT JUST KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD WHAT WE SHOULD -- AND THEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FULL THEY CAN -- PROGRAM AND I'VE HAD. YOU KNOW QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT PROGRAM FOR A LONG TIME AND I KNOW ON THE FACILITY SIDE A LOT OF THAT MONEY IS NOT NINETY EIGHT BUT IT'S STILL MONEY. IN THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO SOMETHING ELSE THE EDUCATION SPHERE -- HOW MUCH EMPHASIS HAS THERE BEEN? WE TALK ABOUT FULL THEY CAN -- FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE HAVE FILLED AGAIN HOW MUCH EMPHASIS HAS THERE BEEN WITHIN THIS PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE. PARTICULARLY TITLE ONE SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP FULL THEY CAN -- BECAUSE I REALLY I THINK YOU KNOW -- FOR FOR FOR YOU KNOW MY OWN HOUSE I WOULD SAY FULL THEY CAN THERE WOULD BE A WANT. BUT IN A TITLE ONE SCHOOL IT'S A NEED. I BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP. SO HOW MUCH EMPHASIS HAS THE PROGRAM PUT OR GOING FORWARD WILL THERE BE. AND REALLY INCENTIVIZING THOSE THOSE THOSE TAIWAN. OUR TITLE ONE SCHOOLS TO CREATE FULL THEY CAN NEVER. GARDEN PROGRAMS FASTER. MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY YES YES THANK YOU SOMETHING MEMBER O'DONNELL THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AFTER THE CURRENT ROUND OF OF FUNDING THE PROGRAM DOES PRIORITIZE -- DISTRICTS BASED THAT HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBERS OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND DISTRICT THAT HAVE TROUBLE RAISING THEIR LOCAL MATCH. I ONE OF THAT SORT OF INTERESTING THINGS IS THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE LOW INCOME DISTRICTS ALREADY A BIT. MORE LIKELY TO OFFER FULL DAY PROGRAMS THAT MORE AT THE MORE AFFLUENT COUNTERPARTS. AND SO IN PRIORITIZING THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED NOW MORE FUNDING WILL PROBABLY GO TO THOSE LOW INCOME DISTRICTS. BUT IT WON'T GO FOR CONVERTING PARKED AT A FULL DAY PROGRAMS WILL GO FOR A SORT OF UPGRADES AND RETROFITS WITHIN DISTRICT THAT ARE ALREADY RUNNING THOSE FULL DAY PROGRAMS. SO THIS MONEY AS AN ONLY TO INCENTIVIZE THE CREATION OF FULL THEY CAN -- BUT TO ENHANCE THE FULL THEY CAN -- SPIRITS. RIGHT DISTRICTS COULD USE THAT IN EITHER WAY I THINK WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED. MANY MEMBERS WERE CONCERNED WERE INTERESTED IN HAVING AN INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE MORE -- FULL DAY PROGRAMS BUT ALSO ALLOW UPGRADES POTENTIALLY -- BUT THE WAY THE PROGRAM HAS UNFOLDED SO FAR IT'S KIND OF BEEN THE REVERSE MOST OF THE FUNDING IS GOING FOR UPGRADE CERTAIN POLITICALLY SMALL CHAIR SHARES GOING TO CONVERT PARKED IN A FULL DAY. WE SAY UPGRADE WHAT DOING BUYING PURCHASING A TRAILER UP I MEAN WHAT. IN A CLASSROOM TO CLASSROOM WITH A WHEN THEY HAVE TO MEET SOME DIFFERENT STANDARD MAYBE. YEAH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS KIND OF A LONG LIST OF STANDARDS THAT KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS ARE SUPPOSED TO MEET EVERYTHING FROM KIND OF THE HEIGHT OF THE FURNITURE IN THE ROOM TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE CLASSROOM RELATIVE TO THE PARENT DROP OFF AREA. AND SO DISTRICTS COULD APPLY FOR FUNDING UNDER THIS GRANT TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE CHANGES TO THAT CLASSROOM OR EVEN CONSTRUCTING NEW CLASSROOM IF THEY WANTED. AND I WOULD JUST CAUTION WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FULL THEY CAN -- RESEARCH BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS BECAUSE NOW OFTENTIMES THEY'LL BE HAPPY CAN -- AND THE TEACHER WILL SPEND THEY WILL HAVE THEIR OWN CLASS HALF THE DAY AND THEY WILL MOVE INTO ANOTHER CLASSROOM GAVE THE DISTRICTS DOING RIGHT. THEY WILL MOVE INTO ANOTHER CLASS FROM THE OTHER BASICALLY MOST OF THE OTHER HALF OF THE DAY SO YOU'LL ACTUALLY HAVE DOUBLE COVERAGE IN THAT CLASS AND YOU HAVE TO TEACHERS MOVING AROUND THAT'S OFTEN HOW IT WORKS I DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS LIKE THAT NEVER DISTRICT. BUTWHAT THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO TO FULL DAYS YOU HAVE ONE TEACHER ALL DAY. INSTEAD OF TWO TEACHERS PART OF THE DAY SO YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT PULL OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE STUDENT CENTER MAYBE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE SUPPORT SO I I JUST HOPE THAT PEOPLE. UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CLASSROOM TO NOT JUST WILL THEY CAN -- GREAT THERE WE GO. RIGHT AND I THINK THE WAY YOU ARTICULATED IS EXACTLY HOW IT TENDS TO PLAY OUT IN IN PRACTICE IT TENDS TO BE PARKED A PROGRAMS ARE TO TEACHERS SWITCHING OFF. AND WHEN WE TALK TO DISTRICTS MANY OF THEM SAID THEIR TEACHERS DID PREFER AT BECAUSE THEY HAD THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO NAY COULD DO THOSE KINDS OF PULLOUT'S YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- WITH MORE OF A FULL DAY MODEL IT'S TYPICALLY JUST ONE TEACHER THROUGHOUT THE DAY. IN SOME CASES THEY MAY HAVE AN INSTRUCTIONAL AIDE ALTHOUGH A LOT OF DISTRICTS DON'T PROVIDE THAT. AND SO IT SOME GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS SOME TEACHERS AND AND SOME PARENTS DO PREFER THE PART DAY APPROACH. RATE IN AND AGAIN PLANNING FOR A KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM -- THERE'S A LOT OF PLANNING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF HANDS ON OUT OF STUFF. PRIOR TO THE START OF THE DAY AND THEY NEED MORE TIME OFF OF PLANNING AND AND AND AND TO CREATE THOSE THOSE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES. AND THE MANIPULATIVESIX CETERA THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE ACTIVITIES AND CLASSROOM TYPICALLY GONNA TAKE MORE TIME AND YOU KNOW I IS A MIDDLE SKATE MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER FOR A LONG TIME. TO SO THANK YOU AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHERS WISH TO COMMENT ON ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS. QUITE OFTEN HEARING IT TEARS OKAY WITH THAT. I SHOULDN'T WHERE THIRTY SO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AT THE FIRST ROUND OF THE HUNDRED MILLION -- THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION JUST CLOSE -- THE FIRST ROUND OF APPLICATIONS -- TO THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION -- AROUND IN THE RECEIVED APPLICATIONS TOTALING TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MILLION AND IT'S BOTH THE GIVING -- SCHOOLS OPPORTUNITY TO UPGRADE THEIR FACILITIES TO ME A CD STANDARDS AS WELL AS REMOVE BARRIERS -- TO PROVIDE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SO WE CONTINUE TO THINK THROUGH -- THE INCENTIVES -- THROUGH THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. I'M NOT SURE WHO SPOKE TO PROTECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION FOR SPECIAL AT FOUR HUNDRED OF ITS ONGOING IF I'M CORRECT -- AND I I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A THRESHOLD FOR A DISTRICT IS IN THERE WITH REGARD TO SPECIAL ED POPULATION. YES THERE IS A THRESHOLD -- IT'S IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE PERCENTAGE OF A DVD PEOPLE'S AND ALSO THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN THEIR DISTRICT COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE -- AND TO SPEAK IN MORE SPECIFICS I WOULD HAVE TO CALL A ONCE I COLLEAGUES BUT IT'S A GOOD BUT AGAIN THE THE THE INTENT OF THIS MONEY IS THAT NOT THAT IT NOT ONLY GO. TO AYE AP DRIVEN SERVICES IS THAT CORRECT -- I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT BUT DESPITE I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE MY COLLEAGUES TO GIVE SOME MORE SPECIFICS. GOOD MORNING LISA RESIDENTS HE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES THAT'S CORRECT IT IS TO GO -- TO IT IT'S INTENDED TO GO TO NON AP RELATED SERVICES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS TECHNICALLY NOT EVEN TECHNICALLY UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW ALL SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS SHOULD BE. RECEIVING ALL THAT SERVICES. REQUIRED IN THERE I A PIECE OF THIS IS KIND OF A TARGETED INVESTMENT. TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES AND SPECIAL JUST CATION STUDENTS AND ALSO TO PREVENT STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE AT RISK OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS SPECIAL EDUCATION TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT. PRIOR TO AN AP [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND I THIS IS ANOTHER QUESTION I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO HAVE THIS DATA NOW BUT I I ASSUME THERE'S YOUR SOME SCHEDULE OR AND STORE SOME DATA RELATIVE. TO HOW MANY SPECIAL ED STUDENTS HE DISTRICT. EACH OF THE THOUSAND DISTRICTS AND STATE CALIFORNIA HAS. CORRECT YEAH THANK YOU MR MEDINA. THANK YOU -- KIND OF FOLLOWING UP WITH MISTER O'DONNELL AND AND HOW WE FIND -- K. TWELVE EDUCATION. I HAVEN'T BEEN A CLASSROOM TEACHER KINDERGARTEN TEACHER I UNDERSTAND THE PREPARATION THAT'S NEEDED -- TO TO BE EFFECTIVE AT THAT GRADE LEVEL. BUT I I WANNA DRAW THE ATTENTION TO LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO PAGE. FIVE TO THE CENSUS BUREAU DATA [inaudible] ANNA AND AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING I WAS A TEACHER FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER -- AND AS I SIT HERE -- IT SEEMS LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN. THE THE POSITION RELATIVE POSITION A PER STUDENT -- FUNDING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MOVED UP TWENTY NOTCHES. WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- WITH WITH WHAT YOU'RE PRESENTING HERE -- BECAUSE AS YOU PROBABLY -- WERE ALLUDING TO THE FIGURE THAT I'VE SEEN. THROUGHOUT THE YEARS IS THAT CALIFORNIA IS IT SOMEWHERE IN THE LOWER FORTIES. IN PER PUPIL SPENDING -- AND YOU. THIS THE FIRST TIME I EVER SEE ANYWHERE. CLOSE TO THE TWENTY SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE. ELABORATE THAT BECAUSE I'M VERY SURPRISED BY THIS. SURE SO I THINK THIS GOES BACK TO A LITTLE BIT OF THE LEG IN THE CENSUS BUREAU DATA HAD A LOT OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE OF WHERE THE STATE STOOD KIND OF IN THE RECESSION YEARS. A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN OR TWO OF THE BEST YEARS THAT IN SCHOOL FUNDING THAT THE STATE HAS HAD IN A VERY LONG TIME AND BOTH OF THOSE YEARS FUNDING WAS GOING NEARLY 10% YEAR OVER YEAR. AND SO AS THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS KIND OF UPDATED ITS DATA AND INCORPORATED THOSE ADJUSTMENTS CALIFORNIA HAS MOVED UP PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY. A WE WERE RANKED -- FAIRLY IN THE LOW FORTIES DURING THE RECESSION YEARS BUT I WITH THE MOVING UP WITH SOME OF THOSE INCREASES AND PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THE PAST FEW YEARS WE'VE ALSO HAD. SOME FAIRLY STEADY INCREASES IN SCHOOL FUNDING BEYOND THAT. I I YOU KNOW I'M GONNA GO OUT AND AND AND AND CHECK BUT I DON'T SEE ANYONE AGREED WITH THE WITH THE THOSE NUMBERS SO IF I COULD JUST ADD THE THE OTHER -- FACTOR THAT YOU YOU CAN NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. NUMBERS FLOATING AROUND AS TO WHERE WE RANK -- WHEN YOU DO TAKE INTO THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS THE? HOW FAR THAT THE DOLLARS THAT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT RECEIVED HOW FOR THE CONSTRUCTION HOW MUCH THEY CAN SPEND TO IN THE ON THE ON THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES? VERSES THE THE OTHER OTHER COSTS -- THE OTHER IT COSTS A LOT MORE TO DO BUSINESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO TO TO DO -- ALL YOUR UTILITY COSTS -- AO. LAND BECAUSE BUILDING COSTS CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE ALL THESE COSTS ARE HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA AND SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU FACTOR THAT IN. AT NEO CALIFORNIA DROPS PRECIPITOUSLY RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES IN TERMS OF RANKINGS. WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE CLASS SIZE -- IN CALIFORNIA IT COMPARED TO OTHER STATES ARE COMPARED TO STATES THAT SPEND MORE OF PER PUPIL AS YOU COMPARE CALIFORNIA'S CLASS SIZE TO WHAT I UNDERSTAND. CLASS SIZES IN PLACES LIKE CONNECTICUT -- IT IT'S DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT -- AND DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT OF WHAT WE ASK OUR TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA TO DO -- WITH A CLASS OF THIRTY SIX STUDENTS OR THAT YOU WOULD ASK A TEACHER AND I'M JUST USING CONNECTICUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM. UP WITH THE CLASS SIZE OF TWENTY AND AND I THINK THE RESULTS MIGHT MAYOR -- BEAR THAT OUT THAT'S TRUE WE DO WE DO HAVE LARGER CLASS SIZES THAN MOST OTHER STATES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- YOU KNOW AS THE BUDGET REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS. TO MESSAGE TO DISTRICTS LIKE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED LIKE OAKLAND UNIFIED THAT INCIDENT JUST BEEN COMING OUT OF THESE TEACHER STRIKES THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTING -- IN THEIR EYES A CRISIS OF THE LACK OF THE INADEQUATE STATE FUNDING -- FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. THE THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD WOULD NOTE THAT -- WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THE EXPERIENCES OF DISTRICTS LIKE THAT BUT I THINK WE WOULD ALSO POINT -- TO THE FLEXIBILITY CERTAINLY THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED -- WITHIN THE LOWER CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA OVER THE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS SINCE ITS ENACTMENT -- AND I THINK THE PROPOSAL -- WITH THE COASTERS -- PAY DOWN PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYERS THIS YEAR -- IS INTENDED SORT OF RECOGNIZE THAT YES WE WE SEE THESE PRESSURES OF GROWING COST WITHIN DISTRICTS THAT I'M OFTEN YOU KNOW THEY FEEL -- THERE REALLY CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE AND WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT WITH SOME OF THAT FUNDING -- ALSO I KNOW AT A LATER HEARING IN THIS COMMITTEE I BELIEVE YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM -- MIGHT FIND WITH THICK MATT AND I I THINK HE COULD ALSO SHED SOME LIGHT AS WELL AND INTO THE WORK THAT. A FIGMENT IS DOING IN WAYS THAT WE'VE -- INCREASE THEIR BUDGET -- IN RECENT YEARS SO THAT HE CAN BE BETTER RESOURCE TO BE ABLE -- TO HELP DISTRICTS BEFORE THINGS -- MAYBE GET TO TO A A WORST POINT -- THEN I WOULD ALSO POINT TO THE A STATEWIDE SYSTEM SUPPORT THAT WE'VE BEEN BUILDING UP OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- MEET WITH THE INTENT OF PROVIDING -- DISTRICTS IN AND COUNTY OFFICES WITH THE SUPPORTS -- TO REALLY BE ABLE -- TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS HOW IT THERE TING TEACHERS ARE HAVE YOU. THAT THE STATE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES -- TO PUT A LOT OF FOCUS IN TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THAT. I THANK GOD CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW APPRECIATE. TO IN A SOME OF THE THE THE GOVERNOR'S -- A PROPOSALS AS TOO QUICK K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION AND AND CLEARLY -- INCREASES BETTER THAN A DECREASE -- BUT I I KNOW THAT THE LAST TIME THE FOLLOWING UP ON THEM THIS MEDINA IS COMMENT ABOUT THE PEOPLE SPENDING. I KNOW THAT THE THE LAST EDUCATION WEEKLY -- A RANKING OF CALIFORNIA -- IN TERMS OF PER PUPIL SPENDING -- TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE COST OF LIVING I BELIEVE WAS FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION I I BELIEVE THAT'S BEEN THE NUMBER THAT'S BEEN -- CITED TO STATE -- SO I ASK. TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE YOU KNOW WHY IS THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE SPENDING. SO I WOULD -- ECHO THE LA OATH COMMENTS AND ALSO -- MISTRESS WAITRESS COMMENTS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- IN JUST POINTING OUT THAT THAT DATA -- UNFORTUNATELY IS LAGGED SELECT DELI -- POINTEDOUT THAT RIGHT THE RANKING THAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR CITING WITH ED WEEK -- IS BASED ON FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DATA BUT ALSO AS A PART OF EDUCATION NOTED -- TAKES INTO ACCOUNT A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT USING WHAT'S CALLED A COMPARABLE WAGE INDEX WHICH BASICALLY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT -- SALARIES FOR NON EDUCATIONAL -- EMPLOYEES. IN IN WHATEVER REGION THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING DATA WERE IN THE LOW TWENTIES WITH THAT ADJUSTMENT FOR COST OF LIVING THAT TAKES US UP TO FORTY FIRST BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT -- THAT NOT WITHSTANDING THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER -- SENSE. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE LC A FAST HAS RECEIVED JUST OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS -- UP THROUGH THE CURRENT BUDGET THAT'S PROPOSED NOW AND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ON THE K. TWELVE SITE HAS ALSO RECEIVED THIRTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AN INCREASE FUNDING. SENSE THOSE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN LEVEL SO WE WOULD ASSUME LIKE THE LA -- POINTED OUT THAT -- WE WOULD START SEEING A RANKING NOW IS AS THE THE GEAR START TO SORT OF CATCH UP -- THAT THESE RANKINGS ARE DONE FOR RESEARCH HERE BREAKING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE INDICATIVE OF YOU SUGGESTED AS A A MORE BURGEONING ECONOMY. AND IF I CAN JUST GATHER SO THE LATEST DATA FROM AND WE COULD ACTUALLY FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SO. FOR AT LEASTFOUR YEARS OLD -- I THINK THE STATE PUBLIC DID STAND IN THE FORTIES AT THAT POINT -- BUT GIVEN THE NEW SORT OF THAT SIGNIFICANT INCREASES THE STATE PROVIDED IN SOME SUBSEQUENT YEARS ARE PROBABLY NO MORE IN THE MID HIRTIES. NOW YOU MAY NOT STILL BE SATISFIED WITH THAT RANKING COMPARED WITH OTHER STATES AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO IMPROVE UPON IT MORE. AND WE CAN HELP YOU THINK ABOUT WAYS TO DO THAT. THE HOW WELL THE ECONOMY IS DONE THE PAST FEW YEARS OUR RANKING HAS BEEN MOVING UP RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES. HI I I APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU KNOW STATISTICS -- AND AND AND NUMBERS CAN BE DIFFERENT -- DEPENDING ON WHO YOU'RE. TALKING TO AND WHAT THEIR AGENDA IS -- BUT I I THINK YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT -- YOU KNOW OAKLEY UNIFIED A I BELIEVE THEY JUST -- TO THE OAKLAND SCHOOL BOARD JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO LAY OFF -- OF OVER A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES CLOSE DOWN PROGRAMS -- IN ORDER TO AFFORD AT THIS 11% -- TEACHER PAY INCREASE THAT -- THAT THE THAT THEY NEGOTIATED TO SETTLE THE OAKLAND STRIKE AND AND AND SO THE REALITY IS THAT YOU KNOW WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- YOU KNOW HOW HOW HOW GOOD WE ARE DOING IN TERMS OF INCREASING STATE FUNDING THE THE REALITY THAT THAT THE THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE THE SCHOOL CHILDREN AND OUR TEACHERS IN OUR AND OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FACING -- ARE -- OUR OUR OUR OUR CUTS AND AND AND JOB LOSSES AND AND PROGRAM. A PROGRAM LOSSES AND SO. YOU KNOW I I YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD OF THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW THIS IS BEING DRIVEN BY. INCREASING FIXED COSTS -- AND I KNOW THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION IS ONE OF THOSE BIG -- ACOSTA BUT I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIDE IN A WAY WE WE DON'T -- IN A WHILE WE'RE AT PATTING OURSELVES ON THE BACK IN IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE DOING ON ON K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION FUNDING THE REALITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- ARE JOB LOSSES IN PROGRAM CUTS -- AND AND I I THINK THIS GOES TO MR DOLLARS POINT ABOUT HOW WE NEED -- TO MAKE THE POLITICAL COMMITMENT HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL IN ORDER. TO TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDING -- IF I MAY A MINIATURE -- I WOULD LIKE -- TO SEGUE -- TO THE LA ALL PRESENTATION AND ESPECIALLY THE ALLY -- YOUR YOUR REPORT WHICH I YOU HAVE IN AND AND PAGE -- FIFTEEN OF YOUR REPORT -- THE L. C. F. F. FUNDING TARGETS AND HOW THE STATE. HAS BEEN -- A PROGRESSING BASED ON THE FUNDING TARGETS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED IN -- TWENTY THIRTEEN YOU RECOGNIZE THIS GRASS YES AND SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT THIS GRAPH AND OR OR THE THE LCF FUNDING TARGETS. THAT WE ESTABLISH IN TWENTY THIRTEEN YOU KNOW WAS THE THEY THEY WERE THEY THEY THE GUIDING BENCHMARKS AGAINST WHICH WE MEASURE OUR PROGRESS TOWARD -- THE THE THE GOAL THAT WE SET IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IN TERMS OF GETTING BACK TO THE PRE RECESSION -- FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE STATE. WHEN WE CREATED THAT WHEN THE STATE CREATED THOSE TARGETS BACK IN? TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN I I THINK ORIGINALLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT WAS TO GET BACK TO THE SEVEN EIGHT LEVELS SOME MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THOUGHT THAT WASN'T AMBITIOUS ENOUGH AND SO WE SET TARGET THERE A LITTLE BIT. ACTUALLY ABOVE WHERE WE WERE BACK IN -- TWO THOUSAND AND I THINK THE WAY WE HAVE COME UP WITH THOSE TARGETS AS WE TRY TO THINK ABOUT WELL HOW MUCH MIGHT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE GROW OVER THE NEXT SEVEN EIGHT YEARS. AND WHAT BY THE STATE REALISTICALLY BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH THAT GROWTH. SO THAT'S WHERE WE CAME UP WITH THAT KIND OF THESE TARGETS I THINK THE REASON WE REACH THEM AHEAD OF SCHEDULE IS BECAUSE THE ECONOMY JUST ENDED UP BEING A LOT BETTER THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS -- THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED GREW QUITE A BIT PARTICULARLY IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AS YOU SEE ON THIS CHART. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF BROUGHT US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY -- SO. WERE FINALLY WE'RE BACK TO WE'RE ACTUALLY -- WE GOT BACK TO SEVEN EIGHT LEVELS A FEW YEARS AGO AND NOW WE STARTED TO PASSING THEM BECAUSE THE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED TO GROW -- BUT NOW I THINK JUST FOUR MONTHS SHORT ABOUT LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION EVER AND SO THAT'S A GIVEN US MORE ROOM TO INCREASE FUNDING BEYOND JUST GETTING BACK THIS OKAY. BUT MY QUESTION WAS THESE FUNDING TARGETS WORTHY GUIDING BENCHMARKS -- BY WHICH WE MEASURE OUR PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOAL THAT WE STATUS IN. THAT THESE TARGETS OF KIND OF BEEN THE FOCUS OF OUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS THE GEFFEN LOCUSTS AND AND AND THE PLANNING TOOL. TO REACH THE GOAL THAT WE SET IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IT'S THE WAY THAT DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THEIR BUDGETS THEY BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THIS SORT OF GAP IS GOING TO BE CLOSED EACH YEAR WHAT'S THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT GOING TO BE. THAT'S KIND OF BEEN. HOW HOW DISTRICTS THINK ABOUT THEIR? IN IN FACT IN YOUR REPORT YOU YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THE STATE REACHED THE LCF A FUNNY TARGET -- TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND SO CLEARLY WE'RE MEASURING OUR PROGRESS BASED ON THE FUNDING TARGETS THAT WE STAFF IS CORRECT YEAH I THINK OF TRADE -- BUT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE FUNDING TARGETS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT SO NOW WE'RE WE'VE CREATED A STATE POLICY THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDE A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THOSE TARGETS. AND THAT'S KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF RETURN TO HOW THINGS WORKED SAY TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHERE IT WAS JUST THE CURRENT LEVEL ADJUSTED EACH YEAR. SORRY YET BUT IT BUT THE THAT THE JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE FUNDING TARGETS ONLY GOT US BACK TO WHERE WE WERE -- IT IN -- SEVEN OH EIGHT WITH. THE SOME COST OF OF OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS THEY GOT US BACK TO ABOVE THAT LEVEL -- PARTLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY WANTED WE WANTED TARGETS THAT WERE SOMEWHAT AMBITIOUS AND WE TRY TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT WAS. PART OF WHAT WE WERE IT WHAT WE COULD FIND WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND KIND OF WHERE WE WANTED TO BE. AND THE TARGETS KIND OF REFLECTED THAT KIND OF BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO OBJECTIVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR O'DONNELL. YEAH I I I THINK I I MAY WANT TO DEFEND THE GOVERNOR HERE FOR A SECOND -- BECAUSE I THINK WHAT THIS BODY KEEPS DOING IT KEEPS DEFINING THE PROBLEM BUT NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION FUNDING -- WHEN THE BUDGET IS IS IS? IT'S A TEAM EFFORT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE GOVERNOR IT'S ALSO ABOUT THIS BODY. AND WE CAN FAULT THE PROPOSED BUDGET BUT IN THE END. WE OWN THE APPROVED BUDGET. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN MISTER MERCY JEFF TO GET AGREE WITH AND I AND I APPRECIATE YOU ADVOCATING I THINK. IT TAKES MORE WILL FROM THIS BODY. TO PUSH FOR MORE THAN. NINETY EIGHT AND I THINK WE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BEEN A MUTUAL FOR EXERCISE WE'VE BEEN AWARE AND WE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE ALL SETTLE FOR THIS THIS NINETY EIGHT BEING THE CEILING. AS OPPOSED TO THE FLOOR. AND I THINK THIS YEAR I HOPEFULLY THE POLITICAL WILL. ANNA POLICY DESIRE WILL BE THERE TO GO WELL ABOVE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WE NEED A STRONGER COMMITMENT FROM THIS LEGISLATURE SHIRT AND CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR AS WELL. BUT AGAIN I THINK SOME OF THAT'S US WE NEED TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR TO AND SEE WHAT OUR ROLE. IN THIS EXERCISE IS AS WELL. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU I'LL TRY TO WRAP THIS UP HERE IN AS ALWAYS I WHAT MY COLLEAGUES. TO SPEAK UP FIRST -- WITH THAT MISTER GALLAGHER WELCOME TO SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER TWO BY THE WAY. GLAD TO BE HERE -- I I DIDN'T HAVE. TOO MUCH MORE TO ADD IN THERE I JUST -- NO ONE IS. I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS THE DECLINE IN. THE CLIENT ENROLLMENT DO WE HAVE LIKE A REASONING FOR THAT WHILE WE'RE SEEN AS THE CLIENTS IN A ROMAN RIGHT NOW. SURE I CAN SPEAK TO THAT THE BIGGEST FACTOR HAS BEEN AND A DROP IN THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS IN THE STATE A STARTING AROUND THE TIME THE GREAT RECESSION BEGAN THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS DROPPED THAT MAY NOT BE A BIG SURPRISE. ABOUT WHAT WAS SURPRISING TO SOME DEMOGRAPHERS IS THAT BIRTH NEVER PICKED UP IN THE RECOVERY STARTED AND SO EVERY YEAR THAT GOES BY EACH COHORT OF INCOMING STUDENTS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE ONE AT YOUR PLACE AND AND SO WITH THAT. DECLINE WE THINK THAT NOT JUST FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS BUT REALLY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. REST ASSURED THE GALLAGHER FAMILY YOU'RE DOING YOUR PART BY AND WE HAVE DONE OUR PART OF THE SIX KIDS RIGHT. FIVE FIVE AND THEN THE OBVIOUS I THINK IT WAS ALREADY KIND OF TALKED ABOUT BUT A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN I I THINK I UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO DO HOWEVER? WE KNOW THAT LIKE IF WE GET HIT WITH A MILD RECESSION. WE COULD HAVE A REAL BIG BUDGET PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS AND I THINK IF WE CUT A TIRE HANDS WITH BY ELIMINATING THE TRUE UP. YOU KNOW HAVING SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY CERTAINLY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP EDUCATION HOLE EVEN WHEN WE GO INTO -- TOUGHER TIMES BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE SO I MEAN I THINK WE SHOULD KIND OF THINK THROUGH THAT. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE EVEN THE L. L. AS WARNED HEY. A MILD RECESSION WE COULD HAVE FORTY YOU KNOW WAS A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT -- ON OUR HANDS SO. I JUST THINK THAT SOMETHING TO BE THINKING ABOUT AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND IF WE MAKE ANY CHANGES -- TO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR ME I THINK WE HAVE TO KIND OF KEEP THAT IN MIND -- AND THEN LAW AND THEN I JUST WANT. TO AND A BECAUSE I KNOW -- SIMON O'DONNELL IS REALLY WORKED ON THIS A LOT TOO IS I THINK TRYING TO MAKE THAT PRIORITIZATION AND AND SOME WOMEN MARRIED TO DELUDED TO IT. EQUALIZATION FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A BIG ISSUE. THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AS WELL -- AND TRYING TO MAKE THAT A PRIORITY. AT SOME POINT TO OUR TO OUR EDUCATION BUDGET AS WELL SO. BUT THAT ALL. TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE CHAIR. THANK YOU -- IS JUST A FEW THINGS I TRY TO WRAP THIS UP SO I I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT -- PER PEOPLE FUNDING IS MISTER MEDINA SAID OUR CLASS SIZES I THINK IT'S IT'S HARD IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES NOT ALWAYS APPLES TO APPLES ORANGES TO ORANGES BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS CALIFORNIA. IS IN THE BOTTOM HALF. IN PER PUPIL FUNDING AND CLASS SIZES AND SO REGARDLESS WHETHER YOU LOOK AT OUR COST OF LIVING. WE'RE STILL NOWHERE NEAR -- THE THE MIDPOINT NOWHERE NEAR THOSE EAST COAST -- STATES THAT HAVE HIGHER OUTCOMES FOR THEIR STUDENTS WITH SIMILAR DEMOGRAPHICS AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT IS WHAT IT IS SO WE CAN'T -- RUN FROM THAT -- AND SO WE DO NEED -- TO TO THINK ABOUT AS HE SAID -- EDUCATION CHAIR O'DONNELL YOU KNOW TRULY FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS ARE WHAT WE VALUE BUT I ALSO NOTE THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE TRADE OFFS TOMORROW WE'RE GONNA BE HERE TALKING ABOUT HIGHER AT WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD FULLY FUND THE UC. AND CSU WELL THOSE ARE THE SAME. POTS OF MONEY THAT WE'RE BE AT WOULD BE -- VYING FOR IF WE TALK ABOUT GOING ABOVE -- NINETY EIGHT MAY WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES AND MAYBE SHUT DOWN THREE PRESENTS SET DOWN THREE PRESENT THIS TO IT -- SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A LARGER BUDGET CONTEXT BUT WE HAVE CERTAINLY OUR JOBS ADVOCATE FOR FOR AT FOR EDUCATION HERE TODAY. I I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE DISTRICTS THAT ARE THAT ARE. HAVING STRIKES IN TROUBLE IN THE CONTRACTS THAT THEIR RIGHTFULLY -- TRYING TO DO RIGHT BY THEIR TEACHERS WHO HAD ARE ENACT INADEQUATELY PAID FOR THE TOP JOBS WE HAVE HUGE CLASS SIZES AND COST OF LIVING IS OUTRAGEOUS A YOU KNOW TO ME TEACHERS. CAN EVEN IF YOU'RE COME CLOSE TO BUY A HOME IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY THAT THEY THEY TEACH AND THAT BEING SAID. SOME OF THAT INFORMATION WORK WORK FOR GETTING A SHOWING THAT. EVEN IF WE HAVE MILD INCREASES IN OUR BUDGET LIKE WE HAVE THIS YEAR FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS THESE DISTRICTS CAN'T AFFORD. THEIR CONTRACTS AND IF WE HAVE ANY. POSITIVE ECONOMY OR A DEATH. THESE DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO GO UNDER. SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU ALL SAY ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP PEACE AND KEEP THE KIDS. A IN A SCHOOL WITH THAT YOU KNOW ADEQUATELY TRAINED TEACHER WHO'S ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED. AND JUST THE MATHEMATICS DON'T ADD UP. SO YOU KNOW. IT EVENTUALLY IT LOOKS LIKE IT'LL COME BACK TO US TO DEAL WITH THE MASS SO. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT YEAH SO SO WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING THAT AS WELL AND AND YOU KNOW? SO THEY YOU KNOW THE THE THE IN IN OAKLAND THAT WHAT MAY BE HAPPENING HERE IN TOWN -- THAT SYNDICATE OF OF THAT BUT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S HAPPENING IN DISTRICTS IS -- WITH THAT DON'T AT THE MOMENT HAVE LABOR ISSUES AS WELL IF IT'S HAPPENING I MEAN. THE OTHER PART PART OF IT IS DECLINING ENROLLMENT WHICH WE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER -- THE STATE YOU KNOW MOST DISTRICTS IN THE STATE ARE ARE IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT AS WELL BUT A BIG PART OF IT IS ALSO YO. YO WE DISCUSS THE THE INCREASED IN THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND AND THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES. AS WELL AS JUST JUST IS JOE THE THE COST INCREASES THAT YO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF LIVING THE INCREASING IN IN IN PENSION COSTS AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT THOSE ARE ALL. ALL CONTRIBUTING FROM FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES AND EURO -- IN MY HEAD. PRESENTATION EARLIER AYE AYE A YOU KNOW EMPHASIZE THE THE NEED TO BE. YOUR FORCES DATEABLE INVESTMENTS I THINK THAT'S THAT'S VERY CRITICAL FOR FOR DISTRICTS GOING FOR THAT I HOPE IN IN LOOKING AT SO THE STRUCTURE OF NINETY EIGHT AND THE THE STRUCTURE OF OF YOU KNOW THE STATE'S BUDGET GOING FORWARD THAT YOU CONSIDER -- NOT JUST SORT OF THE STATE'S FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THE STATE YOUR WILL REACT OR NEED TO REACTIVE REDUCTIONS IN REVENUES BUT ALSO WHAT WHAT. WHAT THAT DOES TO LOCAL AGENCIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICT TEMPERATURE WHERE IN THEIR THEIR ABILITY? TO TO TO REACTIVATE TO CHANGING ECONOMIC AND FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. EVER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M JUST TO ADD TO THAT ON THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH -- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PARTNERS AS WELL AS FISCAL MANAGEMENT -- ASSISTANCE TEAM AND THAT THE COUNTY OFFICES AND THEN THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE AFFECTED AND GOING THROUGH -- SOME OF THESE FISCAL -- FISCAL DIFFICULTIES AT THIS TIME AND MONITORING THE SITUATION VERY CLOSELY. SO I NEED IS PUSHED BACK A LITTLE BIT YEAH WHAT'SYOUR ADVICE TO US IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE. THAT ARE -- ADOPTING THESE THESE -- CONTRACTS IN MAKING DECISIONS THINKING THAT STATE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT THEY'LL BE MORE MONEY AROUND THE CORNER THEY'RE NOT GONNA. WE HEARD OAKLAND MAYBE THERE'S REPORT LIKE -- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT THEY'LL COME BACK AGAIN TO HELP US OUT AGAIN JUST JUST -- WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM TOMORROW. WHAT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR COUNSEL TO TO THE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE MAYOR MAY NOT BE? HAVING STRIKES OR MAY HAVE CONTRACTS COMING UP AND THEY'RE HAVING THE SAME DISCUSSIONS WHEN THEY'RE BALANCING THEIR BUDGETS. I'M CERTAINLY YOU KNOW BUDGETING AT ANY LEVEL AS A MATTER OF FOUND SEEN HERE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT. YOU KNOW AS THESE CONTRACTS ARE BEING NEGOTIATED BUCKLEY THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR AVAILABLE RESOURCES I'M TAKING YOU KNOW FUTURE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS INTO CONSIDERATION AS THEIR NEGOTIATING THOSE CONTRACTS -- I KNOW YOU'D MENTIONED OAKLAND -- IT TYPICALLY -- PROBABLY IN RELATION TO THE ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT -- WHERE WE ARE ANTICIPATING A MARCH A FIRST REPORT THAT WAS RECEIVED THIS LAST WEEK I'M IN THE SPRING WILL HAVE CONVERSATIONS AROUND -- THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THICK MAT AND THE COUNTY OFFICES IN THAT REPORT AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF ASSISTANCE THAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT INTO THE BUDGET IN THE SPRING PROCESS -- I WOULD ADD ONE MORE THING THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT YET AND CERTAINLY THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE ON ON THE RESOURCE SIDE AND POTENTIAL. ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF REVENUE BOTH FOR THE STATE AND ALSO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- IT'S CURRENTLY -- A CONVERSATION THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT IS IS INTERESTED IN IN BEGINNING TO HAVE WITH WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND AND STAKEHOLDERS -- THE AND AND YOU KNOW. YEAH I I KNOW THERE ARE THERE IS POTENTIAL MEASURES ON THE BALLOT AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF THIS OR I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION THE OTHER. OTHER IDEAS AS WELL -- THE THERE I I THINK WE WE NEED TO THINK VERY VERY BROADLY NOT JUST [inaudible] THE OLD. HAVEN'T STATE REVENUE IDEAS BUT ALSO WAYS THAT YOU KNOW THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEM CAN WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER. TO TO TO BRING DOWN MORE FEDERAL FUNDING -- YELLED -- SOURCES THAT MAY NOT BE FULLY UTILIZED AT THE MOMENT AT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO I I THINK YOU KNOW. WE WILL DO OUR THE SUPERINTENDENT CERTAINLY ADVOCATE THAT THAT WE AS A STATE HAVE A DISCUSSION OF A BROAD DISCUSSION AROUND RESOURCES FOR FOR EDUCATION AND REALLY RESOURCES. FOR FOR CHILDREN IN IN GENERAL. THE DAILY I WANT. TO JUMP IN ON WHAT SOME DISTRICTS ARE. GOING THROUGH RELATED TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS THEIR CONTRACTS AND HOW MUCH MONEY THE STATE HAS GOING. FOR YEAH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TOO MUCH TO ADD TO WHAT THE SUPERINTENDENT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY ADDED BUT I THINK WE WOULD JUST REITERATE ARE. KIND OF UNDERSTANDING AT THIS POINT THAT IF ANYTHING THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER BY MAY AND SO I THINK WE WANT TO SEND A STEP. MY DISTRICTS TO SORT OF ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS NOT TO BE TOO AMBITIOUS AND WITH THE PLANNING FOR FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU YES. MR MESSAGING THANK YOU -- ITS SHARE AYE -- WANTED -- TO ALSO WITH FEATURES INDULGENCE. I JUST ASK A FEW QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION -- A AGAIN -- KUDOS TO LA -- FOR YOUR VERY HELPFUL CHARTS YOU HAVE THIS CHART ON FIGURE TEN ON PAGE SIXTEEN WHICH SHOWS THE AREA. THE GROWING SHARE OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS RECEIVING SPECIALIST YOUR YOUR REPORT INDICATES THAT. THAT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION POPULATION HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY INCREASING OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. YES -- AND ALSO YOU YOU MAKE THE POINT IN YOUR REPORT THAT -- THAT BECAUSE THE IN ROMAN HAS BEEN DROPPING OVERALL A WHILE THE THE EXPENSES A SPECIAL EDUCATION HAS BEEN INCREASING -- SPECIALLY WITH THE GROWING POPULATION OF THE HIGHLY INTENSIVE -- NEEDS OR OR THEY STUDENTS NEEDING HIGHLY INTENSIVE SERVICES [inaudible] THAT -- THE GENERAL OF THE LOCAL GENERAL FUND. THE THE THE LOCAL GENERAL FUNDS -- HAVE BEEN COVERING AN INCREASING -- BECAUSE BARBER PORTION OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS IN THAT HAS RISEN. FROM ABOUT 45% OF THE GENERAL LOCAL GENERAL FUNDS TEN YEARS AGO TO NOW APPROACHING 60% -- IT IS IS THAT CORRECT THAT THAT'S CORRECT SPECIAL EDUCATION BE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE STATE TO CATEGORICAL FUNDING INTO DISTRICTS LOCAL GENERAL FUNDS ABOUT WHAT'S CHANGED THE PAST TEN YEARS AS THE RELATIVE SHARE OF THOSE. COSTS DATE. TEN FEDERAL SHARE HAVEN'T BEEN GOING MUCH FASTER THAN THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW FAST COST OF ACTUALLY GROWN IN. KINDOF THOSE OTHER TWO SOURCES HAS MEANT THAT DISTRICTS ARE COVERING A LARGER AND LARGER SHARE OF THEIR GENERAL OPERATING BUDGETS GENERALLY THROUGH THE HOUSE IF STUFF AND AND AND AND THAT CERTAINLY THE THE REALITY THAT -- THAT MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF MY DISTRICT ARE ARE ARE SHARING WITH MANSA THAT I I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU KNOW MY AND MY THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING OF THAT -- THAT THERE BE -- THE TARGETED EDITION OF FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT ONLY FOR THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE. THE THEY THEY THAT THEY RECEIVE THE CONCENTRATION GRANTS FOR FOR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE -- OF A 55% OR HIGHER AND DUPLICATED STUDENTS TO THE IS IT IS THAT CORRECT. GOOD MORNING LISA RESIDENTS KICK IN FIRST -- I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION IS A HIGH PRIORITY OF THE THE ADMINISTRATION AS EVIDENCED BY ITS INCLUSION OF THREE OR NINETY MILLION ON GOING IN AND HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION ONE TIME -- AND SO -- YOU KNOW WITH THAT CONVERSATION IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION IS AN AREA IN THE STATE WHICH NEEDS SOME ADDITIONAL FOCUS. SO -- AND I'M SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION NOW -- MIKE MIKE THE QUESTION IS -- IT IS A CORRECT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW IS ONLY PROPOSING ADDITIONAL FUNDING ONLY FOR THE DISTRICTS SERVING LARGE -- THE V. I. ON THAT THE THE DISTRICTS WITHOUT WITHOUT -- HI UNDER TO GET A STUDENT COUNTS. YES THANK YOU YES THAT IS THE WAY IT THAT THE FORMULA IS DESIGNED FOR HIGH END DUPLICATED IN HIGH AA -- ABOVE AVERAGE SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS SO IT'S MORE OF A TARGETED INVESTMENT WHERE WE BELIEVE THERE'S HIGHER NEED -- AND HIGHER RISK OF BECOMING SPECIAL EDUCATION IDENTIFIED BUT YOU KNOW MY MY CONCERN IS THAT THERE ARE DISTRICTS -- THE THE VAST MAJORITY OF AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS IN THE STATE -- DATA THE FIGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY THEY THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF THE LOW INCOME FOSTER KIDS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BUT STILL THEY HAVE. A HIGH POPULATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. THERE'S THERE'D THE OB STRUGGLING ALSO YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE DEALING WITH THAT SAME REALITY OF OF LARGER LARGER PORTIONS OF THEIR GENERAL FUND -- HAVING TO COVER THE SHORTFALL THAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHORTFALL IN SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS AND SO. YEAH I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE GOVERNOR IS NOT RECOGNIZING THE REALITY THAT. TO THAT THE DISTRICTS WHO -- WITH THE LOWER UNTYPED ON DUPLICATE STATE ACCOUNTS BUT STILL FACE -- SPECIAL EDUCATION CHALLENGES WHY ARE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS NOT TRYING TO HELP THEM OUT ALSO. IT I AND IN THIS INVESTMENT IS RELEASED. AB TARGETED AND KIND OF STRATEGIC REQUIRES ADDITIONAL FOCUS -- THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IS REALLY -- IT'S A FORMULA FOR ALL STUDENTS GENERAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TO THE EXTENT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION NEED AT STUDENT NEED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT DRAW ON THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. IT'S THEIR DOLLARS WELL SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE'VE SEEN TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASES AND LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA SINCE SINCE INCEPTION. SO ALL DISTRICT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN INCREASES IN FUNDING. AND THAT SHOULD BE USED ON THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AS WELL IBM BUT I YOU KNOW WANT TO REMIND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT -- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- THE PER PEOPLE -- STUDENTS SPENDING GOING UP TO TWELVE THOUSAND PER STUDENT I KNOW THAT -- THAT -- SOME OF MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN IN IN MY DISTRICT ARE RECEIVING ON AVERAGE ABOUT -- EIGHT THOUSAND FUNDING PER STUDENT AND SO WHILE THE BE -- THE THE THE INCREASES HAVE HAVE BEEN THE MOST DRAMATIC WITH THE WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE HAVE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S THE THE ALSO ALL DISTRICTS ARE ARE ARE ARE STRUGGLING AND AND SO IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE THAT. TO THAT -- YOU KNOW ALL OF YOU KNOW ALL DISTRICTS HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FUNDING AND I I WOULD JUST ASK THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- TO TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ARE STRUGGLING WITH -- DRAMATICALLY INCREASING SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS WE'VE HEARD THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE CONCERNS BACK WITH US. THANK YOU I WENT TO BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE NEXT PART WITH OUR SUPERINTENDENTS REPRESENTATIVE. TALK ABOUTTHE EARLY EDUCATION COMPONENT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIG HEARING ABOUT THIS A FEW WEEKS AND WE HAD A SPECIAL HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO ON ON PRE K. FOR ALL AND WHAT IT WOULD TAKE YOUR CALIFORNIA SO. OBVIOUSLY IT I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT C. MATTERS AND CERTAINLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- STEPPING UP TO INVEST IN OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND WANTED TO TO REALLY ASK THE LA ABOUT YOUR RECOMMENDATION. THAT AS FAR AS THAT THE PRE K. FOR ALL EXPANSION YOU. YOU -- MAYBE. SUGGEST THAT WE TAKE A STEP BACK BECAUSE THERE'S SOME COME CAPACITY ISSUES AND SO LOGISTICS ISSUES SO. THE FLIP SIDE IS MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT THOSE CAPACITY ISSUES AND FACILITIES AND WORK FORCE -- AS A WAY TO TURN TO WRAP UP AS OPPOSED TO NOT RAMP UP BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED IT KIND OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN. SO DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IN YOUR ANALYSIS. YES WE WE DID THINK ABOUT THAT SO THE GOVERNOR'S PERHAPS A PROPOSAL FOR WORK FORCE AND FACILITY -- FACILITY GRANTS OF BOOK. BUT AS WE LOOKED AT THOSE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF TARGETING ON THOSE PER THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO TARGET THOSE PROPOSALS FOR SPECIFIC ISSUES AND ALL PROVIDE ONE EXAMPLE HERE -- THE FOR THE THE FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICALLY -- I THINK WE ARE WE THINK THAT THE STATE LACKS SOME DATA ON WORKFORCE UP ON SOME BASIC DATA ON WORKFORCE ISSUES SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN THE STATE OR THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN SPECIFIC REGIONS -- AND IT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE FUNDS -- SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS -- IN THE WORK FORCE. WITHOUT HAVING A SET TARGET GOT A NUMBER ABOUT THE SLOTS SO YOU RECOMMEND NOT INCREASING. THE EN THOUSAND FEET WE DO WELCOME TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A NEW SLOT INCREASES AND ALSO STARTING THOSE INCREASES MID YEAR I'M PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE SLIGHT INCREASE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES -- IS A TEN THOUSAND INCREASE WHICH IS ABOUT 40% OF THE NON ELLIE A FULL DAY SLOTS OVER ONE YEAR AND WE THINK THAT MIGHT BE QUITE CHALLENGING. I'M GIVEN SOME LOGISTICAL TERM -- CAN LOGISTICAL CONCERNS ON THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE AS WELL ON AS A PROVIDER SITES A LOCALLY AT THE STATE LEVEL. OKAY WE OBVIOUSLY DISAGREE THAT THAT'S WHY WE'LL HAVE OUR HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE THE SPRING TO IRON THIS OUT SO WITH THAT LET'S. PROCEED WITH OUR NEXT -- SECTION OF THE AGENDA AND THEY'LL GET TO PUBLIC COMMENTS REALLY TO INVITE UP LUPITA CORTEZ AKULA. OUR NEW -- DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT FOR PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION TO SEE THAT CALIFORNIA. AND SUPER EXCITED TO WELCOME YOU IN YOUR NEW CAPACITY. I KNOW YOU'RE HEARING YOUR HIGHER ED WHERE ALL THE LAST FEW YEARS AND AGAIN -- YOU KNOW WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE HAVE YOU SERVE. THE KIDS A CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW YOU'RE MAKING A LOT OF PEOPLE PROUD OF BEING THE FIRST LATINA EVER TO HAVE THIS POSITION IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR JOINING US HERE THIS MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A PLEASURE FOR ME TO BE HERE -- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND -- HE WAS UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY AND SO I AM HERE WITH YOU -- WE HERE I HAVE A HAND OUT THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO NOT FORGET TO SEND TO PROVIDE YOU -- SO YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG I WILL BE BRIEF -- THERE'S FIVE MAIN -- PRIORITIES I WANTED TO OUTLINED FOR YOU TODAY FIRST OF ALL -- YOU KNOW THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE TO THANK THE GOVERNOR. OF FOR HIS ATTENTION AND COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION IN HIS BUDGET. WE HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE WITH MORE -- SO WE'RE EXCITED TO BUILD ON A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT SERVES ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES PREPARING CALIFORNIA TO MEET THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES IN THE WORK FORCE FOR THE TWENTY FIRST. CENTURY AND BEYOND SO WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR FOR PLACING A TOP PRIORITY ON EDUCATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO A REALLY STRONG -- PRODUCTIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH HIM IN THE LEGISLATURE IN OF COURSE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WILL LIFT ALL OUR STUDENTS -- BY IMPROVING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND INCREASING THE RESOURCES TO OUR SCHOOLS. SPECIAL THANK YOU TO YOU CHAIR FOR YOUR STATION ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE EARLIEST LEARNERS. EARLY EDUCATION IS A OBVIOUSLY A CRITICAL STEP IN THE OPPORTUNITY AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. IS WE KNOW THAT 90% OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OCCURS BEFORE THE AGE OF FIVE IT'S SO IMPORTANT ARE EDUCATION RESOURCES PROMOTE A HEALTHY START FOR OUR CHILDREN. MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY LIVE. SO IN ADDITION TO EARLY EDUCATION ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS -- PRIORITIES IS HIGH QUALITY SCHOOLS THAT BETTER EQUIPPED TO SERVICE TO ALL STUDENTS AND THIS IS KNOWN AS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND THAT'S A ON ON YOUR HAND OUT. THE SCHOOL TO WORK WITH THEIR COUNTIES AND LOCAL PARTNERS WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE VERY REAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN FACT. SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN IS SPONSORING LEGISLATION AB ELEVEN NINETY SIX ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON TO CREATE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. SOMETHING YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER WITH REGARD TO THE STRIKES WELL THE STRIKES IS NOT ALL ABOUT THE RACES IT'S ABOUT THE STUDENTS SUPPORTS. IN THE SCHOOLS THE LIBRARIANS A PSYCHOLOGIST THE NURSES AND SO THIS -- THIS EFFORT. IN ATTEMPTS TO TO TO HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THAT AND PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THE SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS -- IN COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY NEEDED SO WE WANT TO CREATE THESE MEANINGFUL STRUCTURES AND STRATEGIES IN RELATIONSHIPS. AND LEARNING CONDITIONS AN OPPORTUNITY SAYS AND SUPPORT THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE -- BOTH IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL. THE SCHOOLS WILL USE THIS INTEGRATED APPROACH TO INCREASE ACCESS TO BUT I MENTIONED EARLIER THE NURSES COUNSELORS SOCIAL WORKERS AND CREATING PLACES WHERE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES HAVE -- HAVE EASY ACCESS TO SERVICES NEEDED TO CLOSE THOSE OPPORTUNITY AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. PROVIDING THE SUPPORT WILL HELP PERSON BE READY AND ABLE TO MEET THE ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED TO THEM IN CLASS CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP REQUIRES ACCESS TO WORLD CLASS INSTRUCTION AND TOOLS INCLUDED. INCLUDING ACCESS TO STEAM AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WHICH IS ANOTHER BIG PRIORITY OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS. SO OUR TEACHERS INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE WORKING WITH OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO DO IT ALONE. WE NEED TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE AND PRACTICE BASED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS AND THE TRAINING NEEDED TO MAKE SURE ALL STUDENTS ARE READING BY THE THIRD GRADE. WHICH BRINGS ME TO A VERY IMPORTANT PASSION OF OUR SUPERINTENDENT THAT LITERACY. IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ACADEMIC AND LIFE SUCCESSES OFTEN SAID YOU KNOW IT IF WE CAN IMPROVE LITERACY AMONGST OUR EARLIEST LEARNERS -- WE CAN HELP SOLVE THE PRESENT YOU KNOW THAT SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. WE NEED TO ENGAGE OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES CREATE A CULTURE OF LITERACY IN READING THAT INSTILLED A LOVE OF LIFELONG LEARNING TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE CAREER TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THE SPEAKING OF EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES YOU TOUCHED ON THIS A LITTLE EARLIER TODAY. SO WE CAN EXPECT TEACHERS TO TEACH HIGH QUALITY TEACHERS TEACH IN AREAS THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN. SO ONE OTHER MAJOR PRIORITY IS THE A WORK FORCE HOUSING SO OUR EDUCATORS CAN LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES EIGHT WHERE THEY WORK. IT'S VITAL FOR OUR DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COUNTY OFFICES TO RECOUP THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST TEACHERS FOR OUR STUDENTS SO WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR TEACHERS. THEY WILL BE ABLE THEN TO INVEST IN EATING OUR TEACHERS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY TEACH AND THEY CAN TAKE THEIR TWO HOURS OF COMMUTE TIME AND INVEST THAT TIME BUILDING STRONGER CONNECTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY SERVER. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF OUR EDUCATORS THEY DESERVE BETTER AND OUR STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. TONY THURMAN AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. IN THE MONTHS AHEAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE THE MOST OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY. BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT SERVES ALL THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES MEETING THEM IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE IN. AND PREPARING OUR STUDENTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WORKFORCE AGAIN OUR PRIORITIES ARE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. EARLY LEARNING LITERACY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND WORK FORCE HOUSING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU PERFECT THANK YOU SO MUCH.

WHAT THEY THINK THAT THEY ARE WHEN PROVIDERS AND CENTERS THIS INCLUDES CENTERS ALSO?

THAT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF I BELIEVE IT'S NEXT WEEK FROM -- MIGHT FIND AFFECT MATT IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING MANY OF THE FISCAL PRESSURES THAT ARE BEING FACED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- AND HOW THOSE COULD BE EXACERBATED -- IF REVENUES WERE TO DECREASE AS WAS SUGGESTED MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY THANK YOU THANK YOU.

AND WE WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE ON THE ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCES THAT ARE DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY YOUR POLICIES. SO IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- CLASS SIZES HAVE BEEN A BIG ISSUE OUR SCHOOL AND OUR EIGHTY COST SIZE RANGE FROM THIRTY NINE TO FORTY STUDENTS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT IS A VERY LARGE AMOUNT. AND IN GENERAL WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LOT OF OTHER STUDENTS SERVICES THAT AREN'T PROPERLY FUNDED FOR INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND COUNCILLORS -- RECENTLY WE HAD A BIG TRAUMA AT OUR SCHOOL AND WE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH GUIDANCE COUNSELORS TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT SITUATION. AND IN ADDITION -- THE FUNDING FOR THIS WOULD BE IT -- GREATLY HELPED THROUGH -- CFF UNFORTUNATELY IRVINE IS FACED WITH THE PROBLEM THAT THE FORMULA -- IS ACTUALLY LEAVING SO UNDER FUNDING DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT HELD UP ADEQUATE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME AND ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS AND DOES NOT MEET THE PERCENTAGE THAT LEADS TO ON THE PROPER CONCENTRATION FUNDING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN -- VERY BENEFICIAL FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT SO WE ALSO LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT -- PROBABLY NINETY EIGHT IS DEFINITELY JUST THE MINIMUM AND THOUGHT WE SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE CEILING. OF WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE -- BETTER FUNDING IN THE FUTURE AND WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. GOOD MORNING SURE MEMBERS THERE ARE SEE WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY WE WANTED TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE INVESTMENTS TO PLAN AND BEGIN DEVELOPMENT OF A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. THAT FOLLOWS STUDENTS FROM EARLY AT THROUGH THE WORK FORCE -- WITHOUT SUCH A SYSTEM WE REALLY ARE UNABLE TO ANSWER CRITICAL. QUESTIONS TO STUDENT PROGRESSION AND OUTCOMES FOR INSTANCE WERE CALIFORNIA'S HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES APPLYING TO AND ENROLLING IN COLLEGE -- ONCE THEY'RE THERE HOW LONG DO THEY TAKE TO COMPLETE AND HOW DO THEY USE THEIR FINANCIAL AID -- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED DISCUSSION ON THIS I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO ENSURE THAT A SYSTEM IS CENTRALIZED INDEPENDENT. AND THAT DATA IS TRANSPARENT TRANSPARENT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND I'LL JUST TAKE OFF A COUPLE OF POINTS I WANTED TO MENTION TO YOU TODAY. FIRST OF ALL WE'RE EXTREMELY ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION AND THIS BEING HIS FIRST BUDGET AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND WITH YOURSELVES ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO MENTION WAS A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM THAT WAS MENTIONED. A LAKE -- ALREADY HAS A SYSTEM CONNECTING OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION DATA PROGRAMS TO K. TWELVE SYSTEMS WITHIN THE COUNTY WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN THAT CHALLENGE ON SO WE REALLY WANT TO BE A PART OF THE DISCUSSION. ANOTHER THING WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE CREATED AN EDUCATIONAL PASSPORT SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE FOSTER AND HOMELESS YOUTH. AND THAT ALLOWS ALL OF THE EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN RECORDS AND GET INFORMATION ON STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTY. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF ESPECIALLY FOR THE FOSTER AND HOMELESS YOUTH WHO ARE IN AND OUT OF OUR JUVENILE HALLS JUVENILE CAMPS. AND ALSO COMMUNITY DAY SCHOOL SO WE THINK THAT THE A MILESTONE FOR US AND WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH OTHERS ON THAT. ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THE FIFTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. OF MONEY FOR THE DEFERRED. ONE THING -- THAT WE KNOW IS LAST YEAR LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAD NINETEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED. AS NEEDING ASSISTANCE -- THROUGH THE STATE WIDE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT AS A RESULT OF THE INFORMATION ON THE STATE WIDE DASHBOARD. THIS YEAR WE HAVE THIRTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT WE THINK THE FUNDING IS VERY IMPORTANT THERE -- WE'VE SENT OUT STRIKE TEAMS WERE WORKING VERY EARLY WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH ALL OF THE DISTRICTS THAT NEED ASSISTANCE. ANOTHER THING I'D ADD IS A LATE CALL WAS THE FIRST ONE TO COME UP WITH AN ELECTRONIC EL CAP TOOL. BECAUSE WE HAD EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE HAD TO JUMP OUT THERE FIRST AND GET GOING SO A LOT OF THAT WORK THAT WE DO IS -- STARTING IN ADVANCE OF DEADLINES AND WORKING WITH OUR DISTRICTS ALL YEAR LONG -- WE THINK HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WE WERE ABLE TO TRANSITION WITH THE HELP OF THE DISTRICTS AND THEIR LEADERSHIPS WE WERE ARE HELPFUL IN TRANSITIONING SCHOOL DISTRICTS OFF OF A DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE LIST. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE PANEL I AM ALSO WITH THE STUDENT ADVOCACY PROGRAM AS SPECIFICALLY REPRESENTING CHESS PLAYERS IN IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PLAYING CHESS INCREASES STUDENT PERFORMANCES ON STANDARDIZED TESTS AND I WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. TO CONSIDERED CONSIDER THIS DURING THE BUDGETARY PROCESS AS WELL AS TO PASS SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION FORTY ONE AGAIN AS A BILL IS INTACT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNINGMICHELLE MCCANN UNDER WHAT ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FUNDING COALITION -- I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S ATTENTION TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT YEARS SO TIGHT -- THE FACT THAT WERE WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WE THINK IS REALLY ENCOURAGING AND AND DEFINITELY APPRECIATE HEARING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. OUT LIKE MANY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ESPECIALLY -- MEMBER MARTUCCI AND THE MEDINA AND O'DONNELL -- WHAT WE THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENT WAY TO PUT THESE FUNDS OUT WE KNOW THAT THE NEED IS STATEWIDE -- THAT IS WHY FOR YEARS WE HAVE ADVOCATED FOR INCREASING FUNDING AFTER THE EXISTING SPECIAL EDUCATION FORMULA FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES TO EQUALIZE THOSE FUNDING RATES -- TO PROVIDE STATE FUNDS FOR PRESCHOOLERS WITH DISABILITIES -- AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WITH THE MOST SEVERE DISABILITIES WE HAVE TO ADD NOTES THAT THE STATE PROVIDES ZERO RESOURCES FOR PRESCHOOLERS WITH DISABILITIES SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO INVEST IN -- AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION THIS YEAR AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
