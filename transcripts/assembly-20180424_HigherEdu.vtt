IT BE IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE.

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:29.934 region:rollup2

GET READY FOR THE EXPANSION. WAS

00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:01.032 region:rollup2
A FORMER PROGRAM DIRECTOR I'M

HER TRACK OF THE RECRUITING.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.070 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO COME FROM OUR AREA

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:07.372 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT. WHEN THEY COME

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.606 region:rollup2
FROM OUR AREA WE OFTEN RETAIN

00:40:07.372 --> 00:40:10.141 region:rollup2
THEM IN OUROUR EXPERIENCES

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:11.709 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO FRESNO ABOUT HALF OF

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:13.344 region:rollup2
OUR. GRADUATES STAY IN THE

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:14.178 region:rollup2
REGION WHICH HAS BEEN REALLY

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:16.547 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS FOR US.

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:17.782 region:rollup2
AND THE TRUTH IS HAVING A HUB

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:19.217 region:rollup2
OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN THE

00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:20.551 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY I THINK WILL

00:40:19.217 --> 00:40:22.453 region:rollup2
ENHANCE OUR CALIBER AND OUR

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:23.621 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO REALLY ATTRACT LOCAL

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:24.789 region:rollup2
TALENT.

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:26.557 region:rollup2
NOW YOU KNOW TRAINING THEM

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:28.259 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY HELPS THEM

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:29.928 region:rollup2
STAY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:31.262 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS A NET EXPORTER OF

00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:31.963 region:rollup2
MEDICAL STUDENTS I DON'T KNOW IF

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.932 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE HOT.

00:40:31.963 --> 00:40:35.300 region:rollup2
WE SEND THEM OUT AND BRING THEM

00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:37.468 region:rollup2
BACK AFTER ALL THEIR TRAINING.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.170 region:rollup2
IT IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE THERE

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:40.972 region:rollup2
DISCONNECTED TO THE LOCATION

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.340 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY TRAIN THEM. OUT WE

00:40:40.972 --> 00:40:44.309 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT IF WE TRAIN.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.044 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE PARTICULARLY IN

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:47.979 region:rollup2
RESIDENCY THEY TEND TO STAY IN

00:40:46.044 --> 00:40:49.347 region:rollup2
THAT LOCATION MORE AND CERTAINLY

00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:51.182 region:rollup2
CREATING A PIPELINE THAT

00:40:49.347 --> 00:40:52.216 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIES TALENTED REGIONAL

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:53.985 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATES.

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:55.486 region:rollup2
FOSTER'S THEM TO BECOME

00:40:53.985 --> 00:40:56.387 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE MEDICAL STUDENT

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:58.823 region:rollup2
CANDIDATES.

00:40:56.387 --> 00:41:00.124 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS THEM THROUGH.

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:02.827 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE.

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:04.128 region:rollup2
AND MEDICAL EDUCATION AND ALSO

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:05.997 region:rollup2
THROUGH GEOGRAPHIC.

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:08.166 region:rollup2
TRAINING IN RESIDENCY I THINK

00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:10.368 region:rollup2
WILL CREATE A SOLUTION FOR SOME

00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:10.902 region:rollup2
OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE BY

00:41:10.368 --> 00:41:12.270 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND RETAINING OUR

00:41:10.902 --> 00:41:14.105 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:15.840 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WHERE OF FACING SOME

00:41:14.105 --> 00:41:17.575 region:rollup2
REAL CHALLENGES WITH.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.544 region:rollup2
THE AGING MARROW PHYSICIAN

00:41:19.544 --> 00:41:23.014 region:rollup2
FIFTY SEVEN SO I'M AMONG THE

00:41:21.546 --> 00:41:24.782 region:rollup2
GROUP OVER FIFTY FIVE WHO.

00:41:23.014 --> 00:41:25.850 region:rollup2
ARE SET TO RETIRE IN THE NEXT

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:27.251 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS AND WE ARE NOT

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.953 region:rollup2
REPLACING THE NUMBER OF

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:30.555 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS THAT ARE RETIRING.

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:32.690 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSED MECHANISM OF AB

00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:35.159 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO A TO ADD BY CREATING

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:37.261 region:rollup2
A BRANCH CAMPUS OF UCSF AT UC

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:38.296 region:rollup2
MERCED. OF FOR BAY BASIC SCIENCE

00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:39.764 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE

00:41:38.296 --> 00:41:41.165 region:rollup2
REGIONAL TRAINING THEY CAN GET

00:41:39.764 --> 00:41:43.668 region:rollup2
CLINICALLY IN THIS IN THE VALLEY

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:45.670 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AT UCSF FRESNO.

00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:46.938 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WILL BE A MODEL AND

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.106 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN A MODEL THE UNIVERSITY

00:41:46.938 --> 00:41:50.141 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA HAS USED

00:41:48.106 --> 00:41:51.609 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY. IN FACT.

00:41:50.141 --> 00:41:53.544 region:rollup2
GERMAN MEDINA I WAS.

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:55.513 region:rollup2
UC RIVERSIDE UNDERGRADUATE I

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:57.315 region:rollup2
WAS ATTRACTED TO UC RIVERSIDE

00:41:55.513 --> 00:41:59.350 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF ITS BRANCH CAMPUS

00:41:57.315 --> 00:42:00.651 region:rollup2
STATUS WITH UCLA. ALTHOUGH I

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:02.587 region:rollup2
CHOSE TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:04.355 region:rollup2
UCSF I WAS IMPRESSED. BY THE

00:42:02.587 --> 00:42:06.424 region:rollup2
CALIBER OF STUDENTS THAT THE

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:07.892 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ATTRACTED I THINK BECAUSE

00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:08.760 region:rollup2
OF ITS BRANCH CAMPUS IDENTITY.

00:42:07.892 --> 00:42:10.194 region:rollup2
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:13.164 region:rollup2
IDENTITY WILL HELP YOU SEE

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:15.800 region:rollup2
MERCED IN RECRUITMENT AS WELL.

00:42:13.164 --> 00:42:18.002 region:rollup2
SOME. THAT THE TRUTH IS THAT.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.303 region:rollup2
IN.

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:20.238 region:rollup2
TERMS OF QUALITY OF MEDICAL

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:22.640 region:rollup2

00:42:20.238 --> 00:42:23.541 region:rollup2
THE CLINICAL CAMPUS AT UCSF

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.977 region:rollup2
FRESNO IS.

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:26.377 region:rollup2
ON PAR WITH ALL THE MAJOR

00:42:25.977 --> 00:42:29.213 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SCHOOLS.

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:32.216 region:rollup2
I MYSELF AS A MEDICAL STUDENT

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:33.184 region:rollup2

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.890 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME I SAW SOME OF THE

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:47.222 region:rollup2
REGULARITY. AYE AND THEREFORE

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:47.856 region:rollup2
THESE COURSES DO NOT ALLOW

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:48.891 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO PROGRESS THROUGH THEIR

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:50.526 region:rollup2
UNIT LOAD.

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:51.393 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THERE'S SIMPLY NOT

01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:53.395 region:rollup2
ENOUGH COURSES DURING THE

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.929 region:rollup2
REGULAR SCHOOL YEAR STUDENTS ARE

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.397 region:rollup2
OBLIGATED TO DO ONE OF TWO

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:57.233 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:58.167 region:rollup2
EITHER THEY EXTEND THEIR

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:59.835 region:rollup2
GRADUATION SOMETIMES

01:18:58.167 --> 01:19:01.604 region:rollup2
INDEFINITELY.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:02.671 region:rollup2
I KNOW STUDENTS IN THE MATH

01:19:01.604 --> 01:19:04.306 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AT SAC STATE WHOSE

01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:06.542 region:rollup2
EXTENDED HER GRADUATION TIME AT

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:07.376 region:rollup2
SEVEN YEARS. ARE BECAUSE OF THE

01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:08.410 region:rollup2
AND AVAILABILITY OF BOTTLENECK

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.712 region:rollup2
COURSES.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:11.513 region:rollup2
OR THE OTHER OPTION IS TAKE

01:19:09.712 --> 01:19:13.415 region:rollup2
SUMMER CLASSES.

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:15.884 region:rollup2
HOWEVER FOR MANY STUDENTS WHILE

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:16.385 region:rollup2
THE SUMMER CLASSES EXIST

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.987 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY

01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:18.554 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:19.355 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL BURDEN PLACED UPON

01:19:18.554 --> 01:19:21.624 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:23.058 region:rollup2
.

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:24.994 region:rollup2
AND OF BECAUSE OF SITUATIONS

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:26.195 region:rollup2
LIKE OVER ENROLLMENT IN THE UC

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:28.197 region:rollup2
AND THE CSU OBLIGATED UP BY THE

01:19:26.195 --> 01:19:29.498 region:rollup2
STATE'S.

01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:30.933 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:32.334 region:rollup2
CLASSES

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:33.636 region:rollup2
BUT LIKE I SAID A MOMENT AGO

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:35.104 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CLASSES ARE

01:19:33.636 --> 01:19:36.271 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY MEANINGLESS UNLESS

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.974 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ACCEPTABLE OR THEIR.

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:40.676 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS.

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:42.311 region:rollup2
AND BY THAT ONCE AGAIN I MEAN

01:19:40.676 --> 01:19:43.679 region:rollup2
BEING EXCEEDINGLY HIGH FINANCIAL

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:44.246 region:rollup2
BURDEN PLACED ON STUDENTS WHEN

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:45.981 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ACCESS THE SUMMER

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:47.483 region:rollup2

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:48.384 region:rollup2
IN ORDER FOR STUDENTS TO

PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS ENROLLED

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:16.572 region:rollup2

INSTITUTIONS.

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:27.416 region:rollup2
AND CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT

THE NATIONAL FOR YOUR AVERAGE

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:30.552 region:rollup2
BECAUSE GRADUATION IS AROUND

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:32.221 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT WE QUESTION WITH

INSTITUTION ACTUALLY EXISTS.

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:36.024 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY HAVE THAT SUMMIT BE

FRIEND.

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:47.636 region:rollup2
SIDE OVER HERE THE PUBLIC

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:48.670 region:rollup2
POLICY IS THAT OF CALIFORNIA DO

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:50.205 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SAYING THAT IF CURRENT

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:52.541 region:rollup2

AN EDUCATION CRISIS BUT THAT IS

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:03.619 region:rollup2
AN ECONOMIC CRISIS.

01:22:01.717 --> 01:22:04.653 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:06.155 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS

01:34:53.321 --> 01:34:56.024 region:rollup2
IS VITAL.

01:34:55.223 --> 01:34:57.592 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:58.393 region:rollup2
COMPARE THE DIFFERENCES IF THERE

01:34:57.592 --> 01:35:00.662 region:rollup2

WE ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENT.

01:48:26.367 --> 01:48:29.603 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA FARM BILL HAS

01:48:27.668 --> 01:48:31.605 region:rollup2
THREE CORE TENANTS FIRST

AGRICULTURE.

01:48:34.041 --> 01:48:36.944 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL

01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:38.645 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY HAS SEEN DRAMATIC

01:48:36.944 --> 01:48:40.114 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN HOW IT MUST OPERATE.

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:42.149 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA FARM BILL TAKES

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:55.996 region:rollup2
ACTION TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S

TO CDFA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A

01:49:24.158 --> 01:49:27.728 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED AG BUSINESS PORTAL.

01:49:26.627 --> 01:49:28.862 region:rollup2
AND REQUIRES THE ECONOMIC

01:49:27.728 --> 01:49:30.564 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO

01:49:28.862 --> 01:49:32.533 region:rollup2
DEDICATE RESOURCES TO CAPTURE

THE FARM TO FORK ECONOMIC IMPACT

01:49:32.533 --> 01:49:36.336 region:rollup2
OF AGRICULTURE.

01:49:34.134 --> 01:49:38.172 region:rollup2
SECOND IT CREATES A STATEWIDE AG

01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:40.707 region:rollup2
INNOVATION PLATFORM.

01:49:38.172 --> 01:49:42.676 region:rollup2
AG IN RURAL CALIFORNIA OR IF IN

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:45.612 region:rollup2
INTRINSICALLY INTERTWINED AND

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:47.681 region:rollup2
AND AS GO GOES AG SO GOES RURAL

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:49.917 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. I WANTED TO IMPROVE

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:51.084 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMIC CONDITION FOR RURAL

01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:52.352 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS IN MY COMMUNITY AND I

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:54.321 region:rollup2
WAS THINKING INITIALLY WAS GOING

01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:55.823 region:rollup2
TO BE ACT TOURISM. BUT I QUICKLY

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:57.524 region:rollup2
REALIZED THAT THE AG INDUSTRY

01:49:55.823 --> 01:49:59.560 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ITS SURVIVAL IN THE

01:49:57.524 --> 01:50:00.894 region:rollup2
STATE. AND THAT LEAVING WILL BE

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:02.963 region:rollup2
A DEATH BLOW TO RURAL

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:04.565 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND TO EFFORTS TO

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:05.966 region:rollup2
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES.

01:50:04.565 --> 01:50:07.601 region:rollup2
SO IT IS NOT ABOUT ACT TOURISM

01:50:05.966 --> 01:50:09.470 region:rollup2
AT THE GROUND LEVEL IT'S ABOUT

01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:11.071 region:rollup2
SAVING AG SO THERE CAN BE AG

01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:12.573 region:rollup2
TOURS IN THE FUTURE.

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:14.208 region:rollup2
WE REALIZE THAT PROGRAMS LIKE

01:50:12.573 --> 01:50:16.043 region:rollup2
SWEET AND HEALTHY SOILS ARE

01:50:17.678 --> 01:50:21.615 region:rollup2
THAT IMPROVE AG PRACTICES.

01:50:20.314 --> 01:50:23.383 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WEALTH

01:50:21.615 --> 01:50:25.219 region:rollup2

THE AG TECH INNOVATION INSTITUTE

01:52:57.804 --> 01:53:00.140 region:rollup2
WILL VET AND APPROVE

01:52:59.539 --> 01:53:02.009 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE CREDIT

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:03.276 region:rollup2
WORTHY. OPERATORS WILL HAVE TO

01:53:02.009 --> 01:53:04.645 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS

01:53:03.276 --> 01:53:05.312 region:rollup2
DEPLOYED ON THE ACRES IN

01:53:04.645 --> 01:53:07.714 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION WHAT'S REALLY

01:53:05.312 --> 01:53:09.449 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS THAT I'M

01:53:07.714 --> 01:53:11.051 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE ACTIVE. TECH THAT'S

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:12.352 region:rollup2
BEEN CREATED HAS BEEN CREATED BY

01:53:11.051 --> 01:53:12.653 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE NO

01:53:12.653 --> 01:53:18.358 region:rollup2
NO CONNECTION TO AGRICULTURE

01:53:15.389 --> 01:53:18.892 region:rollup2
AND SO EACH COMMODITY EACH OP

01:53:18.358 --> 01:53:19.860 region:rollup2
PRODUCT THAT'S GOING TO

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:21.461 region:rollup2

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:24.898 region:rollup2
SOIL NEEDS DIFFERENT WATERY

01:53:22.863 --> 01:53:27.167 region:rollup2
NEEDS AND SO THIS.

01:53:24.898 --> 01:53:29.069 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE WILL BE PERFECTLY

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:31.071 region:rollup2
POISED TO TEST THESE MASON

01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:31.705 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES TO DETERMINE

01:53:31.071 --> 01:53:32.606 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO

01:53:31.705 --> 01:53:34.741 region:rollup2
WORK.

01:53:32.606 --> 01:53:36.143 region:rollup2
JOBS ON THE FARM WILL CHANGE

01:53:34.741 --> 01:53:37.811 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT FARMWORKERS OVER

01:53:36.143 --> 01:53:40.414 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE IN THE LABOR POOL IS

01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:42.115 region:rollup2
FINE EIGHT NOW FEWER JOBS ARE IN

01:53:40.414 --> 01:53:43.750 region:rollup2
THE FIELD BUT THEY WILL BE IN A.

01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:46.253 region:rollup2
IN A OF A DIFFERENT NATURE

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:47.788 region:rollup2
HIGHER PAYING ABLE TO MANAGE IN

01:53:46.253 --> 01:53:49.122 region:rollup2
IN A GREAT WITH TECHNOLOGY.

01:53:47.788 --> 01:53:51.058 region:rollup2
IT WILL RESULT IN THE RETENTION

01:53:49.122 --> 01:53:52.726 region:rollup2
OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL IN RURAL

01:53:51.058 --> 01:53:54.294 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THEY WON'T HAVE TO

01:53:52.726 --> 01:53:56.863 region:rollup2
MOVE TO THE SILICON FOR VALLEY

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:58.665 region:rollup2
TO WORK AT THAT. TECH IN AG TECH

01:53:56.863 --> 01:54:00.534 region:rollup2
AND THE RETURN OF TECH START UP

01:53:58.665 --> 01:54:02.069 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVES TO RURAL ROOTS LIKE

01:54:00.534 --> 01:54:03.737 region:rollup2

02:00:00.427 --> 02:00:04.164 region:rollup2
IS BADLY NEEDED WE'D LIKE TO SEE

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:05.498 region:rollup2
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO

LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THE MARRIAGE

02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:03.156 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY.

02:01:01.387 --> 02:01:04.624 region:rollup2
AND PRACTICES IN A BLACK

02:01:03.156 --> 02:01:06.126 region:rollup2

BODIES CLIMATE SMART FARMS IN

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:09.829 region:rollup2
THE ACT TECH INSTITUTE TO MOVE

02:01:08.962 --> 02:01:11.231 region:rollup2
US A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THAT

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:12.398 region:rollup2
DIRECTION THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE

02:01:11.231 --> 02:01:13.333 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAD.

02:01:12.398 --> 02:01:16.369 region:rollup2
YOU THINK ANY WHICH IS IN

02:01:13.333 --> 02:01:18.304 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

02:01:16.369 --> 02:01:21.341 region:rollup2
SCENE NINE. ANY QUESTIONS

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:23.776 region:rollup2
COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

02:01:21.341 --> 02:01:25.812 region:rollup2
MS DOCTOR WEB.

02:01:23.776 --> 02:01:27.180 region:rollup2
I JUST A QUICK THIS IS A.

02:01:25.812 --> 02:01:28.648 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A

02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:30.049 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IS THAT WHAT

02:01:28.648 --> 02:01:32.318 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING HERE.

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:34.687 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WERE AUTHORIZING THE.

02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:36.823 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE DEVELOPING. A

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:38.625 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IRAQ CORRECT

02:01:36.823 --> 02:01:39.826 region:rollup2
IT NOW THEY ALREADY HAVE A A AD

02:01:38.625 --> 02:01:41.928 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM HOW DOES THIS

02:01:39.826 --> 02:01:44.030 region:rollup2
INTERFACE WITH THAT. AND.

02:01:41.928 --> 02:01:44.764 region:rollup2
IN MAY IN MAYBE I CAN HAVE THAT

02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:47.200 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE.

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:48.668 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOT STAFF IF

02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:50.970 region:rollup2
YOU WANNA AT HAVE A DETAILED

02:01:48.668 --> 02:01:54.574 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS BUT THE IDEA IS THAT.

02:01:50.970 --> 02:01:56.509 region:rollup2
DID THE THAT CAREER TECHNOLOGY.

02:01:54.574 --> 02:01:58.478 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW DOESN'T THAT FOR

02:01:56.509 --> 02:02:00.980 region:rollup2
THEIR VERY. IT INFORMALLY MANY

02:01:58.478 --> 02:02:02.382 region:rollup2
OF THE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:03.416 region:rollup2
ARE TO ARE INTEGRATING

02:02:02.382 --> 02:02:04.117 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY INTO WHAT THEY'RE

02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:06.653 region:rollup2
DOING.

02:02:04.117 --> 02:02:09.189 region:rollup2
WEST TELLS HAS A SMART FARM

02:02:06.653 --> 02:02:09.489 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'VE DEPLOYED A A

02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:11.591 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF.

02:02:09.489 --> 02:02:13.793 region:rollup2
.

02:02:11.591 --> 02:02:14.994 region:rollup2
AT OF THE TECHNOLOGY TYPES IN

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:16.095 region:rollup2
ORDERED IT TO TEACH THEIR

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:17.697 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BUT WE THINK IT OUGHT

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:18.298 region:rollup2
TO BE CURRICULUM BASED AND WE

02:02:17.697 --> 02:02:19.265 region:rollup2
REALLY THINK THAT IT OUGHT TO

02:02:18.298 --> 02:02:21.100 region:rollup2
BE.

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:23.169 region:rollup2
THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:24.671 region:rollup2
GET THE SAME KIND OF CURRICULUM

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:26.339 region:rollup2
ALL OVER THE STATE.

02:02:24.671 --> 02:02:28.741 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WHAT.

02:02:26.339 --> 02:02:30.677 region:rollup2
MY VISION OF IT IS IS THAT IT'S

02:02:28.741 --> 02:02:32.245 region:rollup2
IT'S THE ABILITY TO HAVE.

02:02:30.677 --> 02:02:34.147 region:rollup2
YOU SEE A IN OUR.

02:02:32.245 --> 02:02:35.782 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT

02:02:34.147 --> 02:02:36.015 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES TEACHING.

02:02:35.782 --> 02:02:37.550 region:rollup2
THEY'RE.

02:02:36.015 --> 02:02:37.784 region:rollup2
.

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:40.253 region:rollup2
THEY'RE.

02:02:37.784 --> 02:02:42.222 region:rollup2
.

02:02:40.253 --> 02:02:43.423 region:rollup2
TECH AG PEOPLE WHAT THOSE

02:02:42.222 --> 02:02:44.724 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES ARE AND THEN USING

02:02:43.423 --> 02:02:46.159 region:rollup2
THEM ALSO DOWN IN THE COMMUNITY

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:47.293 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SYSTEM.

02:02:46.159 --> 02:02:48.828 region:rollup2
SO MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOMEBODY

02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:49.362 region:rollup2
THAT HAS A BETTER EXPLANATION OF

02:02:48.828 --> 02:02:52.966 region:rollup2
HOW THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:02:49.362 --> 02:02:53.933 region:rollup2
WORKS.

02:02:52.966 --> 02:02:54.767 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S ALL THANKS FOR

02:02:53.933 --> 02:02:56.035 region:rollup2
ASKING ACT I WAS THAT DON'T WHEN

02:02:54.767 --> 02:02:57.437 region:rollup2
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND

02:02:56.035 --> 02:02:59.505 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE WITH

02:02:57.437 --> 02:03:01.608 region:rollup2
THE AND THE C. ID. WAS BASED ON

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:03.343 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF TRANSFER STUDENTS

02:03:01.608 --> 02:03:05.078 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRING AND AND SO ACT WE

02:03:03.343 --> 02:03:06.646 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY WERE GOING TO GET

02:03:05.078 --> 02:03:07.380 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE PATHWAY.

02:03:06.646 --> 02:03:09.015 region:rollup2
AND THAT MANY OF OUR

02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:10.683 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES THAT THAT SIXTEEN

02:03:09.015 --> 02:03:12.218 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT MAJORS AND SO WE WERE

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:14.153 region:rollup2
VERY HAPPY THAT WE GOT THREE BUT

02:03:12.218 --> 02:03:15.855 region:rollup2
WITHIN THOSE THREE PLANT SCIENCE

02:03:14.153 --> 02:03:18.258 region:rollup2
ANIMAL SCIENCE BAG BUSINESS.

02:03:15.855 --> 02:03:20.627 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE A FOCUS ON.

02:03:18.258 --> 02:03:23.229 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND SO ONE OF THE THE

02:03:20.627 --> 02:03:25.732 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS HERE IS FOR STUDENT

02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:26.866 region:rollup2
THAT GOES THROUGH A TNC PROCESS.

02:03:25.732 --> 02:03:28.701 region:rollup2
BUT DOESN'T TRANSFER TO

02:03:26.866 --> 02:03:29.469 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY DO THEY HAVE THOSE

02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:31.271 region:rollup2
THOSE TECHNOLOGY SKILLS TO BE

02:03:29.469 --> 02:03:31.804 region:rollup2
ABLE TO LAND A JOB.

02:03:31.271 --> 02:03:33.640 region:rollup2
AND THIS WOULD THIS WOULD

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:35.174 region:rollup2
INCREASE THAT.

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:36.809 region:rollup2
AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

02:03:35.174 --> 02:03:37.910 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS DOES IT GO TO

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:39.779 region:rollup2
ALL THE CAMPUS SO SUGGEST

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:41.547 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CAMPUSES.

02:03:39.779 --> 02:03:43.349 region:rollup2
YES AND THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE AND

02:03:41.547 --> 02:03:44.417 region:rollup2
AT ITS THOSE CAMPUSES THAT OFFER

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:46.152 region:rollup2
DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AND

02:03:44.417 --> 02:03:47.887 region:rollup2
AGONIZE RESOURCES AND SO THE SEE

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:48.454 region:rollup2
EDDIE ALSO IS BASICALLY A MODEL

02:03:47.887 --> 02:03:50.023 region:rollup2
SO THAT EACH CAMPUS HAS THE

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:51.324 region:rollup2
SAME.

02:03:50.023 --> 02:03:52.959 region:rollup2
COURSE WORK.

02:03:51.324 --> 02:03:53.860 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE ALIGNED STATEWIDE

02:03:52.959 --> 02:03:55.428 region:rollup2
SO THAT THERE'S NO

02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:57.196 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE TWO

02:03:55.428 --> 02:03:57.730 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ALL THE CAMPUSES THAT

02:03:57.196 --> 02:03:59.599 region:rollup2
OFFER IT BUT YES THEY ARE

02:03:57.730 --> 02:04:01.034 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE.

02:03:59.599 --> 02:04:02.068 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A

02:04:01.034 --> 02:04:04.037 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM THOUGH THAT THEY

02:04:02.068 --> 02:04:05.004 region:rollup2
PRESENT AN ACT CURRICULUM DON'T

02:04:04.037 --> 02:04:07.373 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE ONE I WAS READING

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:07.940 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT. THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A

02:04:07.373 --> 02:04:08.941 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM THAT THE COMMUTER

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:10.777 region:rollup2
COLLEGE OF THIS OF.

02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:12.011 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF THEM USE ARE THOSE

02:04:10.777 --> 02:04:13.479 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE AG PROGRAMS THEY

02:04:12.011 --> 02:04:15.081 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAVE A PROGRAM UNTIL YOU

02:04:13.479 --> 02:04:17.283 region:rollup2
ADDING IS A TECHNOLOGY.

02:04:15.081 --> 02:04:19.252 region:rollup2
SO RIGHT NOW SO WHAT EACH

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:20.520 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE THERE ARE MANY

02:04:19.252 --> 02:04:21.788 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINES BUT THEN AGAN AFTER

02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:23.623 region:rollup2
RESOURCES PROGRAM FORCED TO NOT

02:04:21.788 --> 02:04:25.325 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AG BUSINESS. IN TERMS

02:04:23.623 --> 02:04:26.859 region:rollup2
OF THEIR COURSE IDENTIFICATION

02:04:25.325 --> 02:04:28.861 region:rollup2
TRANSFER MODEL CURRICULUM THERE

02:04:26.859 --> 02:04:30.830 region:rollup2
ARE JUST THREE AG BUSINESS PLANT

02:04:28.861 --> 02:04:32.065 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND ANIMAL SCIENCE SO

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:33.700 region:rollup2
THIS I DON'T THINK IT'S EXACTLY

02:04:32.065 --> 02:04:36.069 region:rollup2
DOES A CREATE A TRANSFER MODEL

02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:37.403 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM. BUT MODEL CURRICULUM

02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:40.206 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM

02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:42.041 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY IN AG TECHNOLOGY SO

02:04:40.206 --> 02:04:43.609 region:rollup2
WHILE THERE IS EDUCATION GOING

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:46.612 region:rollup2
ON IN AB TECHNOLOGY WHAT THERE

02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:47.814 region:rollup2
IS NOT IS CONFIRMED STATEWIDE

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:49.983 region:rollup2
ALIGNMENT IN THE ACT TECHNOLOGY.

02:04:47.814 --> 02:04:52.585 region:rollup2
AND AND IF.

02:04:49.983 --> 02:04:53.720 region:rollup2
I CAN INTERJECT AYE AYE.

02:04:52.585 --> 02:04:55.254 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMUNITY

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:57.023 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SYSTEM IS NOT TAKING A

02:04:55.254 --> 02:04:58.758 region:rollup2
POSITION FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S

02:04:57.023 --> 02:05:00.326 region:rollup2
OFFICE THEY HAVE NO POSITION.

02:04:58.758 --> 02:05:00.493 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM.

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:02.528 region:rollup2
AND.

02:05:00.493 --> 02:05:03.730 region:rollup2
.

02:05:02.528 --> 02:05:05.698 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN NEXT CONCERNS

02:05:03.730 --> 02:05:12.238 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED BY THE COMMUNICATIVE

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:12.805 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC SAID.

02:05:12.238 --> 02:05:14.640 region:rollup2
IN ANY OTHER QUESTION MISTER

02:05:12.805 --> 02:05:15.575 region:rollup2
PATTERSON.

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:17.110 region:rollup2
JUST TAKE A QUICK COMMENT ABOUT

02:05:15.575 --> 02:05:17.944 region:rollup2
WEST HILLS COMMUNICATIVE KNOW

02:05:17.110 --> 02:05:19.245 region:rollup2
THEM WELL.

02:05:17.944 --> 02:05:21.881 region:rollup2
IN OUR AREA.

02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:23.149 region:rollup2
.

02:05:21.881 --> 02:05:24.917 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU WERE DOING IN THAT AREA

02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:26.719 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE LEAD NOT ONLY IN THIS

HANDFUL OF THINGS THAT WE NEED

02:16:37.823 --> 02:16:41.794 region:rollup2

02:16:39.591 --> 02:16:43.495 region:rollup2
LOOK AT APPROVING MORE BOND AT

SERVICE RATIO OF ABOUT FIVE

02:16:54.239 --> 02:16:57.843 region:rollup2
PERCENT THAT'S FIVE PERCENT OF

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:59.511 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND REVENUE. THAT GOES

02:16:57.843 --> 02:17:00.646 region:rollup2
TO NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN

02:16:59.511 --> 02:17:02.381 region:rollup2
PAYING OFF ON DAD.

02:17:00.646 --> 02:17:04.783 region:rollup2
NOW CAN BE DEBATED WHETHER OR

02:17:02.381 --> 02:17:06.552 region:rollup2
NOT THAT NUMBER IS TOO HIGH OR

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:09.021 region:rollup2

DOLLAR PROP FIFTY ONE K. TWELVE

02:17:18.097 --> 02:17:21.266 region:rollup2
BOND THAT JUST PASSED. LAST

02:17:19.698 --> 02:17:22.901 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER. YOU KNOW WE HAD A

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:24.703 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR THAT AT ONE TIME WAS

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:26.338 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY FOCUSED ON A WALL

02:17:24.703 --> 02:17:27.439 region:rollup2
OF DEBT AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S

02:17:26.338 --> 02:17:29.508 region:rollup2
PULLING BACK FROM THAT A LITTLE

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:30.943 region:rollup2
BIT. BUT AGAIN WE ALSO DO YOU

02:17:29.508 --> 02:17:33.112 region:rollup2
HAVE THESE ONGOING GENERAL FUND

02:17:30.943 --> 02:17:34.613 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES THAT WE NEED TO PAY

02:17:33.112 --> 02:17:36.548 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO.

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:38.517 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT NUMBER TWO I THINK

02:17:36.548 --> 02:17:40.385 region:rollup2
WHEN ANALYZING A BLIND WE DO

02:17:38.517 --> 02:17:42.421 region:rollup2
NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. LIKE

02:17:40.385 --> 02:17:44.223 region:rollup2
PROP FIFTY ONE SOME OF THE BONDS

02:17:42.421 --> 02:17:45.624 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW BONDS LIKE HIGH SPEED

02:17:45.624 --> 02:17:50.362 region:rollup2
RAIL BUT THERE IS MEMBERS KNOW

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:51.897 region:rollup2
PRIORITY WITHIN OUR BOND SYSTEM

02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:53.799 region:rollup2
ABOUT PRIORITIZING WHICH BONDS

02:17:51.897 --> 02:17:55.400 region:rollup2
ARE MORE IMPORTANT. IS A HIGHER

02:17:53.799 --> 02:17:56.802 region:rollup2
EDUCATION BOND MORE IMPORTANT

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:58.203 region:rollup2
IMPROPER FIFTY ONE IS IT MORE

02:17:56.802 --> 02:17:59.605 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:17:58.203 --> 02:18:01.540 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO THE TREASURE HAS

02:17:59.605 --> 02:18:03.041 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTED TO. ATTEMPT TO TRY AND

02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:04.209 region:rollup2
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS BUT

02:18:03.041 --> 02:18:05.844 region:rollup2
THERE'S NONE OF THAT IN PLACE

02:18:04.209 --> 02:18:06.979 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHICH

02:18:05.844 --> 02:18:08.413 region:rollup2
ONES ARE MORE IMPORTANT ANOTHER

02:18:06.979 --> 02:18:10.182 region:rollup2
BONDS AND IF THESE OTHER

02:18:08.413 --> 02:18:11.984 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO CROWD AND

02:18:10.182 --> 02:18:13.719 region:rollup2
TERRY DEBT SERVICE RATIO. AND AS

02:18:11.984 --> 02:18:15.154 region:rollup2
WE PREPARE TO ENTER INTO ANOTHER

02:18:13.719 --> 02:18:17.055 region:rollup2
RECESSION WHICH IS INEVITABLE

02:18:15.154 --> 02:18:18.157 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO PAY

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:20.259 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO.

02:18:18.157 --> 02:18:22.261 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW FINALLY. PROPER AND

02:18:20.259 --> 02:18:23.562 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE USE OF BONDS IS TO

02:18:22.261 --> 02:18:25.097 region:rollup2
FUND PROJECTS THAT LAST THE

02:18:23.562 --> 02:18:27.099 region:rollup2
LENGTH OF THE BLIND.

02:18:25.097 --> 02:18:29.334 region:rollup2
SO PRIMARILY MAJOR CAPITAL

02:18:27.099 --> 02:18:32.070 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND ALSO

02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:34.072 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT LIFE CYCLE COSTS

02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:36.175 region:rollup2
ARE APPROPRIATE YOU DO NOT WANT

02:18:34.072 --> 02:18:38.477 region:rollup2
TO USE BOND DOLLARS FOR INSTANCE

02:18:36.175 --> 02:18:41.346 region:rollup2

TECHNOLOGY ORDER FUN FURNITURE

02:18:43.048 --> 02:18:45.984 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE NOT

02:18:44.249 --> 02:18:47.252 region:rollup2
GOING TO LAST A LINK TO THE BOND

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:48.820 region:rollup2
LIFE CYCLE COSTS.

02:18:47.252 --> 02:18:50.322 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:52.591 region:rollup2
AND MEMBERS NONE OF THESE

02:18:50.322 --> 02:18:54.092 region:rollup2
FACTORS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED YOU

OR FRANKLY A LOT OF OTHER BONDS

02:18:55.827 --> 02:19:00.199 region:rollup2
AND SO. IT'S MORE JUST PREVIOUS

02:18:58.697 --> 02:19:02.301 region:rollup2
OVER OUR KING REASONS AND NOT

02:19:00.199 --> 02:19:03.402 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY FOR THE BOND ITSELF

02:19:02.301 --> 02:19:04.937 region:rollup2
THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN

02:19:03.402 --> 02:19:06.138 region:rollup2

BAKER.

02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:17.015 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK YOU MEMBERS THAT

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:18.650 region:rollup2
A MAN AND GRAYSON FOR.

02:19:17.015 --> 02:19:19.451 region:rollup2
FOR BRINGING FOR THE

02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:20.886 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

02:19:19.451 --> 02:19:22.054 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT WE MAKE IN FACILITIES

02:19:20.886 --> 02:19:23.789 region:rollup2
WE VISITED ABOUT THIS I DON'T

02:19:22.054 --> 02:19:24.623 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY LIKE BONDS FOR MANY

02:19:23.789 --> 02:19:25.924 region:rollup2
OF THE REASONS THAT THE

02:19:24.623 --> 02:19:27.626 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED SOME HOWARD JARVIS

02:19:25.924 --> 02:19:29.161 region:rollup2
OF POINTED OUT IF WE. IF WE IT'S

02:19:27.626 --> 02:19:30.629 region:rollup2
A IT'S A MUCH OF THE TIME IT'S A

02:19:29.161 --> 02:19:31.863 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF PRIORITIES WHICH BUT

02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:33.865 region:rollup2
WE DO IN OUR BUDGET BECAUSE IF

02:19:31.863 --> 02:19:36.001 region:rollup2
WE SPEND IT. WITHOUT ISSUING A

02:19:33.865 --> 02:19:37.402 region:rollup2
BOND WE ARE PREVENTING FUTURE

02:19:36.001 --> 02:19:38.804 region:rollup2
BUDGETS BEING CROWDED OUT BY IST

02:19:37.402 --> 02:19:40.138 region:rollup2
INTEREST.

02:19:38.804 --> 02:19:42.040 region:rollup2
SO I LOOK AT WITH THE VERY

02:19:40.138 --> 02:19:43.075 region:rollup2
SKEPTICAL I BONDS WHEN THEY COME

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:44.376 region:rollup2
BEFORE ME.

02:19:43.075 --> 02:19:45.344 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS ONE

02:19:44.376 --> 02:19:46.879 region:rollup2
TODAY BECAUSE I WANT THE

02:19:45.344 --> 02:19:47.913 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE ABOUT

02:19:46.879 --> 02:19:50.682 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEED TO BE INVESTED IN

02:19:47.913 --> 02:19:52.618 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT DO YOU

02:19:50.682 --> 02:19:54.386 region:rollup2
WANT TO UNDERSCORE SOME OF THE

02:19:52.618 --> 02:19:56.321 region:rollup2
VOTE VALID POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:19:54.386 --> 02:19:58.690 region:rollup2
RAISED PARTICULARLY MAKING SURE

02:19:56.321 --> 02:20:00.993 region:rollup2
IF YOU CAN AND MAKE PRIORITIES

02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:03.428 region:rollup2
IN THIS THAT IT IS. LONG TERM

02:20:00.993 --> 02:20:05.130 region:rollup2
CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL

02:20:03.428 --> 02:20:06.398 region:rollup2
LAST NOT STILL HAVE FOR THE BOND

02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:08.533 region:rollup2
THAT PERHAPS EVEN LONGER.

02:20:06.398 --> 02:20:10.469 region:rollup2
HARD TO BELIEVE THAT BUT. IN AND

02:20:08.533 --> 02:20:12.137 region:rollup2
SECONDLY. AN ISSUE WAS NOT

02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:13.805 region:rollup2
RAISED BUT YOU KNOW I SUPPORTED

02:20:12.137 --> 02:20:15.941 region:rollup2
THE FACILITIES VON FOUR KEY

02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:17.042 region:rollup2
THROUGH FOURTEEN AND FOUND THAT

02:20:15.941 --> 02:20:18.377 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S TRICKLING OUT

02:20:17.042 --> 02:20:20.112 region:rollup2
THOSE DOLLARS WHICH I THINK IS

02:20:18.377 --> 02:20:22.614 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH AGAINST THE WILL. OF

02:20:20.112 --> 02:20:24.916 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS WHO VOTED FOR IT

02:20:22.614 --> 02:20:26.285 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMINGLY. AND I WOULD

02:20:24.916 --> 02:20:28.787 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE YOU AS YOU LOOK AT THE

02:20:26.285 --> 02:20:30.055 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

02:20:28.787 --> 02:20:31.623 region:rollup2
CLOSE ANY.

02:20:30.055 --> 02:20:34.293 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLES RUN ALL THE TRAPS TO

02:20:31.623 --> 02:20:36.295 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT A GOVERNOR CANNOT

02:20:34.293 --> 02:20:37.796 region:rollup2
UNILATERALLY REWRITE WHEN THE

02:20:36.295 --> 02:20:40.032 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT.

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:41.533 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONCE WE'VE MADE A

02:20:40.032 --> 02:20:43.468 region:rollup2
DECISION AS AS A LEGISLATURE TO

02:20:41.533 --> 02:20:44.036 region:rollup2
PUT IT ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTERS

02:20:43.468 --> 02:20:48.707 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE VOTE YES ON THIS

02:20:44.036 --> 02:20:49.675 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MAY

02:20:48.707 --> 02:20:50.642 region:rollup2
NOT SUPPORT IT WHEN IT'S ON THE

02:20:49.675 --> 02:20:52.344 region:rollup2
BALLOT THAT YOU WANNA GET ON

02:20:50.642 --> 02:20:54.012 region:rollup2
THERE. BUT ONCE IT'S ON THERE

02:20:52.344 --> 02:20:55.447 region:rollup2
THAT THE WILL OF CALIFORNIANS IS

02:20:54.012 --> 02:20:56.748 region:rollup2
HONORED AND SO THAT'S A

02:20:55.447 --> 02:20:57.849 region:rollup2
CAUTIONARY WORD GIVEN THE WHAT

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:58.884 region:rollup2
WE WHAT WE'RE SEEING HAPPEN

02:20:57.849 --> 02:21:00.052 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WITH THE SCHOOL

02:20:58.884 --> 02:21:01.320 region:rollup2
FACILITIES BOND AND WHAT IT'S

02:21:00.052 --> 02:21:03.588 region:rollup2
DOING TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:05.157 region:rollup2
WHO ARE BASICALLY AWAITING A

02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:06.591 region:rollup2
RETURN OF LOANS THEY'VE

02:21:05.157 --> 02:21:07.826 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY MADE TO THE STATE

02:21:06.591 --> 02:21:09.928 region:rollup2
AND TO TRY TO REALLY MAKE SURE

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:11.830 region:rollup2
THIS GOES TO LONG TERM CAPITAL

02:21:09.928 --> 02:21:13.699 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT OUTLAYS? I THINK THAT

02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:16.201 region:rollup2
MAKES IT A MUCH MORE LEGITIMATE

02:21:13.699 --> 02:21:18.203 region:rollup2
CASE IN AN IDEAL WORLD.

02:21:16.201 --> 02:21:19.638 region:rollup2
WE WE SET OUR PRIORITIES SO THAT

02:21:18.203 --> 02:21:20.972 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY SO MUCH ON

02:21:19.638 --> 02:21:22.874 region:rollup2
DEBT THERE IS A CASE TO BE MADE

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:24.009 region:rollup2
IN TIMES FOR BONDS AND I THINK

02:21:22.874 --> 02:21:25.377 region:rollup2
YOU CAN MAKE THAT CASE. WITH

02:21:24.009 --> 02:21:26.812 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY'S CORRECTIONS THANK YOU

BUT YOU WILL BE.

02:21:33.452 --> 02:21:35.721 region:rollup2
I THINK IS AS ALWAYS MISTER WILL

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:36.655 region:rollup2
MAKE SOME VERY SALIENT POINTS

02:21:35.721 --> 02:21:37.723 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD HATE TO BE

02:21:36.655 --> 02:21:38.724 region:rollup2
OUTFLANKED ON THE LEFT BY MS

02:21:37.723 --> 02:21:41.326 region:rollup2

.

02:21:44.162 --> 02:21:47.099 region:rollup2
I I THINK WHEN WE WE KIND OF

02:21:45.364 --> 02:21:48.734 region:rollup2
THINK GLOBALLY IN LONG TERM IN

02:21:47.099 --> 02:21:49.101 region:rollup2
ALL SERIOUSNESS I APPRECIATE MY

02:21:49.701 --> 02:21:53.705 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:21:52.137 --> 02:21:56.041 region:rollup2
YEAH WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO LOOK

02:21:53.705 --> 02:21:57.075 region:rollup2
AT THE FUTURE OF THE DISTANT

02:21:56.041 --> 02:21:59.978 region:rollup2
HIGHER HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM

02:21:57.075 --> 02:22:01.613 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT THE WHAT

02:21:59.978 --> 02:22:04.916 region:rollup2
THE PHYSICAL NEEDS THE CAPITAL

02:22:01.613 --> 02:22:06.685 region:rollup2
NEEDS ARE FOR THOSE SYSTEMS AND

02:22:04.916 --> 02:22:08.420 region:rollup2
HOW THEY CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO

02:22:06.685 --> 02:22:10.522 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS THE SKILL

02:22:08.420 --> 02:22:11.490 region:rollup2
BUILDING NEEDS TO CAREER. NEEDS

02:22:10.522 --> 02:22:14.126 region:rollup2
IN ANY JOB.

02:22:11.490 --> 02:22:15.494 region:rollup2
THE PROSPECT OF JOBS AS WELL

02:22:14.126 --> 02:22:15.827 region:rollup2
AND WHERE THEY WOULD BE AND THEN

02:22:15.494 --> 02:22:17.696 region:rollup2
THE TYPE OF.

02:22:15.827 --> 02:22:19.097 region:rollup2

I DON'T KNOW WHAT ORDER THEY

02:22:22.134 --> 02:22:25.637 region:rollup2
SHOULD GO IN BUT I THINK THAT WE

02:22:24.069 --> 02:22:27.272 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED THE SEGMENTS TO BE.

02:22:25.637 --> 02:22:28.840 region:rollup2

INVESTMENT WOULD BE MADE WHICH I

02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:33.612 region:rollup2
THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR

02:22:33.078 --> 02:22:38.116 region:rollup2
VOTERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:22:33.612 --> 02:22:40.519 region:rollup2

UP MOST OF YOU KNOW WE'VE TRIED

02:22:49.761 --> 02:22:53.565 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE WAYS OF FIGURING OUT

02:22:51.363 --> 02:22:54.800 region:rollup2
HOW TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF

02:22:53.565 --> 02:22:56.301 region:rollup2
THE C. ISSUE. THEN YOU SUCH

02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:57.269 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE IN TERMS OF STUDENT

02:22:56.301 --> 02:22:59.805 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

02:22:57.269 --> 02:23:02.374 region:rollup2
MANY OF YOU HAVE PUT TOGETHER

02:22:59.805 --> 02:23:03.909 region:rollup2
RESOLUTIONS TO A BASICALLY BUILD

02:23:02.374 --> 02:23:05.644 region:rollup2
NEW CAMPUSES ONLY TO HAVE THAT

02:23:03.909 --> 02:23:07.813 region:rollup2
EITHER DERAILED BY THE GOVERNOR

02:23:05.644 --> 02:23:08.547 region:rollup2
OR SOMEBODY. WE'VE TRIED THE.

02:23:07.813 --> 02:23:10.449 region:rollup2
THE.

02:23:08.547 --> 02:23:11.683 region:rollup2
THE ORGANIZATION THAT WE HAVE

02:23:10.449 --> 02:23:13.552 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER IT ORGANIZATION THAT

02:23:11.683 --> 02:23:14.886 region:rollup2
USED TO HAVE A MAP OUT THINGS

02:23:13.552 --> 02:23:16.788 region:rollup2
FOR US AND PUT THINGS TOGETHER

02:23:14.886 --> 02:23:17.856 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS NOT. A SOMEONE'S

02:23:16.788 --> 02:23:19.925 region:rollup2
TRIED THAT FOR THE LAST SIX

02:23:17.856 --> 02:23:21.893 region:rollup2
USING EACH YEAR IT'S BEEN DITA

02:23:19.925 --> 02:23:23.795 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN VETOED SO. THIS IS AN

02:23:21.893 --> 02:23:24.563 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO REALLY START LOOKING

02:23:23.795 --> 02:23:26.465 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:23:24.563 --> 02:23:28.834 region:rollup2
PROBABLY OF ALL THE THINGS THAT

02:23:26.465 --> 02:23:30.569 region:rollup2
A BOND COULD DO THAT MIGHT LAST

02:23:28.834 --> 02:23:32.370 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF LONGER THAN THE.

02:23:30.569 --> 02:23:34.639 region:rollup2
PLAYBACK OF OF OF OF OF THE OF

02:23:32.370 --> 02:23:36.174 region:rollup2
THE BOND ITSELF IS UNIVERSITY. I

02:23:34.639 --> 02:23:37.909 region:rollup2
MEAN WE DON'T HAVE UNIVERSITIES

02:23:36.174 --> 02:23:40.645 region:rollup2
THAT DIE OUT IN THE AGENCY ISSUE

02:23:37.909 --> 02:23:42.514 region:rollup2
pCALLED IS THE DOUBT IN TWENTY

02:23:40.645 --> 02:23:43.548 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS. MOST OF THEM

02:23:42.514 --> 02:23:45.150 region:rollup2
EXPAND AND GROW IN A MOST ARE

02:23:43.548 --> 02:23:47.285 region:rollup2
UNIVERSES OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD

02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:48.553 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK IRVINE WAS THE LAST

02:23:47.285 --> 02:23:50.956 region:rollup2
ONE JUST TURNED FIFTY OR SAN

02:23:48.553 --> 02:23:52.591 region:rollup2
MARCOS ONE. TURN TWENTY FIVE SO

02:23:50.956 --> 02:23:53.859 region:rollup2
THEY GENERALLY LAST THEY LAST

02:23:52.591 --> 02:23:55.627 region:rollup2
LONGER THAN THAN MOST THINGS AND

02:23:53.859 --> 02:23:57.229 region:rollup2
SO IT THAT SINCE HE BECOMES VERY

02:23:55.627 --> 02:23:58.530 region:rollup2
GOOD INVESTMENT. OF BECAUSE YOU

02:23:57.229 --> 02:24:03.034 region:rollup2
KNOW IT WILL LAST LONGER THAN

02:23:58.530 --> 02:24:03.902 region:rollup2
JUST PAYING BACK THE BOND TO BUY

02:24:03.034 --> 02:24:04.536 region:rollup2
IPADS AND THINGS THAT CHANGE.

02:24:03.902 --> 02:24:05.070 region:rollup2
THE UNIQUE THING TOO IS THAT YOU

02:24:04.536 --> 02:24:06.271 region:rollup2
KNOW OF THE SYSTEMS WHICH

02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:07.873 region:rollup2
NORMALLY DON'T COOPERATE ALL THE

02:24:06.271 --> 02:24:09.140 region:rollup2
TIME TOGETHER ARE REALLY IN

02:24:07.873 --> 02:24:12.277 region:rollup2
COOPERATION WITH THIS. THE

02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:14.045 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT OF THE A UC CAMPUS THE

02:24:12.277 --> 02:24:15.480 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR OF THIS A C. ISSUE

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:17.148 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL WEIGHED IN ON THIS

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:18.283 region:rollup2
AND THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

02:24:17.148 --> 02:24:20.051 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY TOO ARE

02:24:18.283 --> 02:24:21.486 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING THE FACT THAT WE

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:23.021 region:rollup2
ARE REVVING UP EVERYBODY OF THE

02:24:21.486 --> 02:24:24.523 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEY SAY WE

02:24:23.021 --> 02:24:27.359 region:rollup2
GETTING THEM READY.

02:24:24.523 --> 02:24:28.860 region:rollup2
TO GO SOMEWHERE MOVES LIKE WHEN

02:24:27.359 --> 02:24:29.828 region:rollup2
THEY GET READY TO GET ON THE ON

02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:31.596 region:rollup2
RAMP OF THE FREE WEIGHTS THIS

02:24:29.828 --> 02:24:31.930 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF THE UC AND THERE'S NO

02:24:31.596 --> 02:24:33.298 region:rollup2
ROOM.

02:24:31.930 --> 02:24:34.099 region:rollup2
AND SO AS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT

02:24:33.298 --> 02:24:36.301 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE OF OUR STUDENTS

02:24:34.099 --> 02:24:37.536 region:rollup2
NEEDING TO GET AN A A DEGREE OR

02:24:36.301 --> 02:24:39.171 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND THEN HAVE THE

02:24:37.536 --> 02:24:40.472 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY OF MOVING ON. WE

02:24:39.171 --> 02:24:42.407 region:rollup2
HAVE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT'S

02:24:40.472 --> 02:24:43.475 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO IT AND OUR SYSTEMS

02:24:42.407 --> 02:24:45.443 region:rollup2
BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN

02:24:43.475 --> 02:24:47.779 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHING THAT BUT UNLESS WE

02:24:45.443 --> 02:24:48.280 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING TO BUILD MORE. OF

02:24:47.779 --> 02:24:50.015 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES WILL THEN FIND

02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:51.183 region:rollup2
OURSELVES ONCE AGAIN WITH AS WE

02:24:50.015 --> 02:24:52.317 region:rollup2
DO THIS YEAR OVER THIRTY

02:24:51.183 --> 02:24:53.952 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STUDENTS NOT BEING ABLE

02:24:52.317 --> 02:24:55.820 region:rollup2
TO GET A SLOT. IN EITHER ONE OF

02:24:53.952 --> 02:24:57.322 region:rollup2
OUR CAMPUSES ARE AND.

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:59.090 region:rollup2
THAT WILL ONLY GROW AS WE

02:24:57.322 --> 02:25:01.059 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT.

02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:03.194 region:rollup2
THE OTHER EXPANDING OUR

02:25:01.059 --> 02:25:04.429 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM GETTING MORE OF OUR

02:25:03.194 --> 02:25:05.797 region:rollup2
STUDENTS INTO THE UNIVERSITY

02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:07.098 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING EXPANDING

02:25:05.797 --> 02:25:07.699 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID ALL THOSE THINGS

02:25:07.098 --> 02:25:08.833 region:rollup2
AS INCENTIVES FOR STUDENTS TO

02:25:07.699 --> 02:25:10.435 region:rollup2
GO.

02:25:08.833 --> 02:25:11.436 region:rollup2
AND GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL POST

02:25:10.435 --> 02:25:12.971 region:rollup2
SECONDARY AND.

02:25:11.436 --> 02:25:14.739 region:rollup2
AND YET WE ARE NOT THINKING IN

02:25:12.971 --> 02:25:16.775 region:rollup2
TERMS OF EXPANSION OF THOSE

02:25:14.739 --> 02:25:18.810 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES WE HAVE A WHAT WE CALL

02:25:16.775 --> 02:25:20.111 region:rollup2
EDUCATION DEBTS IN THE STATE.

02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:22.614 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE ARE NO CAMPUSES

02:25:20.111 --> 02:25:23.615 region:rollup2
ALMOST THE ISSUE NO UC CAMPUS?

02:25:22.614 --> 02:25:25.584 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS IS

02:25:23.615 --> 02:25:27.352 region:rollup2
AB AS OUR POPULATION GROWS AND

02:25:25.584 --> 02:25:29.454 region:rollup2
WE EXPAND BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE.

02:25:27.352 --> 02:25:30.488 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS WERE WORKING CLASS

02:25:29.454 --> 02:25:31.323 region:rollup2
STUDENTS NOW WANT TO GO TO

02:25:30.488 --> 02:25:32.824 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WHICH WHAT THE

02:25:31.323 --> 02:25:33.692 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WAS

02:25:32.824 --> 02:25:35.894 region:rollup2
DESIGNED FOR.

02:25:33.692 --> 02:25:37.462 region:rollup2
OF MANY OF THEM CAN GOING TO

02:25:35.894 --> 02:25:38.530 region:rollup2
FOR THE GOAL OF VACANCY AT HOME.

02:25:37.462 --> 02:25:39.931 region:rollup2
BUT THEY CAN'T STAY AT HOME

02:25:38.530 --> 02:25:41.166 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN A COMMUNITY

02:25:39.931 --> 02:25:43.168 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE ARE NO SEE ISSUES

02:25:41.166 --> 02:25:45.070 region:rollup2
AND NO UC'S AND WE HAVE SOME

02:25:43.168 --> 02:25:46.438 region:rollup2
PLACES LIKE THAT. THEN THE COST

02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:47.439 region:rollup2
OF ONE COLLEGE WITH THEM BECOMES

02:25:46.438 --> 02:25:49.407 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

02:25:47.439 --> 02:25:51.643 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO CREATE A GREAT

02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:52.310 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO

02:25:51.643 --> 02:25:54.479 region:rollup2
GOOD JOBS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:55.480 region:rollup2
GOOD JOBS THAT THIS THAT THAT

02:25:54.479 --> 02:25:56.748 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO THIS

02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:58.650 region:rollup2
IS REALLY A FORWARD LOOKING

02:25:56.748 --> 02:25:59.851 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN

02:25:58.650 --> 02:26:01.386 region:rollup2
DO. AYE AS WELL ENTERING

02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:03.321 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY A NEW CYCLE OF OF

02:26:01.386 --> 02:26:04.289 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP IN AND AND CALIFORNIA

02:26:03.321 --> 02:26:05.824 region:rollup2
WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR.

02:26:04.289 --> 02:26:07.192 region:rollup2
AND SOME OTHERS TO START

02:26:05.824 --> 02:26:09.327 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PLANNING IN THIS

02:26:07.192 --> 02:26:11.196 region:rollup2
IS DESIGNED TO DO THAT TO REALLY

02:26:09.327 --> 02:26:11.896 region:rollup2
HELP TO EXTRACT AND BUILD OUR

02:26:11.196 --> 02:26:13.632 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES.

02:26:11.896 --> 02:26:15.266 region:rollup2
I CANCERS ARE CONCERNED SOME OF

02:26:13.632 --> 02:26:16.601 region:rollup2
THE OTHER BECOMING OBSOLETE IN

02:26:15.266 --> 02:26:17.636 region:rollup2
THEIR LABS IN THOSE KINDS OF

02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:19.638 region:rollup2
THINGS AND SO. ALSO WE

02:26:17.636 --> 02:26:21.840 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY WE TAKE PRIDE WE

02:26:19.638 --> 02:26:22.974 region:rollup2
BRAG ABOUT OUR THREE TWO SYSTEM

02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:24.609 region:rollup2
AND IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST

02:26:22.974 --> 02:26:26.044 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. BUT IT

02:26:24.609 --> 02:26:27.412 region:rollup2
WILL NOT REMAIN THAT WAY UNLESS

02:26:26.044 --> 02:26:28.680 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IT AND

02:26:27.412 --> 02:26:33.518 region:rollup2
SO I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH THIS

02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:33.852 region:rollup2
AND I TO MOVE AB TWENTY SEVEN

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:34.285 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ONE.

02:26:33.852 --> 02:26:36.121 region:rollup2
SECOND.

02:26:34.285 --> 02:26:37.422 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER.

02:26:36.121 --> 02:26:41.459 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER JOBS

02:26:37.422 --> 02:26:41.893 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS GARMENTS.

02:26:41.459 --> 02:26:45.230 region:rollup2
IT WAS.

02:26:41.893 --> 02:26:45.697 region:rollup2
TODAY I WAS TALKING TO A.

02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:46.731 region:rollup2
TWO STUDENTS FROM THE

02:26:45.697 --> 02:26:50.068 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY.

02:26:46.731 --> 02:26:51.336 region:rollup2
OF SAN DIEGO.

02:26:50.068 --> 02:26:53.305 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THE STORIES

02:26:51.336 --> 02:26:55.140 region:rollup2
IN THE SUB TO MEETING ABOUT THE

02:26:53.305 --> 02:26:57.242 region:rollup2
INABILITY OF THE STUDENTS.

02:26:55.140 --> 02:27:00.145 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THEIR CLASSES THEY NEED

02:26:57.242 --> 02:27:01.746 region:rollup2
TO GET OUT WITHIN FOUR YEARS.

02:27:00.145 --> 02:27:02.747 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF TIME JUST BECAUSE

02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:03.315 region:rollup2
WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE

02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:05.250 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS IN THERE TO GET A

02:27:03.315 --> 02:27:06.584 region:rollup2
MINUTE.

02:27:05.250 --> 02:27:08.119 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO TALK TO THE STUDENTS

02:27:06.584 --> 02:27:10.088 region:rollup2
OR STAND. THERE.

02:27:08.119 --> 02:27:11.456 region:rollup2
THERE IN ROOMS THAT ARE LARGE

02:27:10.088 --> 02:27:12.857 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FOR THE STUDENTS SO THEY

02:27:11.456 --> 02:27:15.093 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SIT ON THE FLOOR BRING

02:27:12.857 --> 02:27:18.363 region:rollup2
TABLES AND CHAIRS AND.

02:27:15.093 --> 02:27:20.365 region:rollup2
THE UC'S SYSTEM.

02:27:18.363 --> 02:27:22.434 region:rollup2
IS THE INNOVATOR.

02:27:20.365 --> 02:27:23.001 region:rollup2
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAVE

02:27:22.434 --> 02:27:23.702 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REGIONS WITHIN THE

02:27:23.001 --> 02:27:25.904 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:27:23.702 --> 02:27:27.605 region:rollup2
IT MAKES MONEY.

02:27:25.904 --> 02:27:29.808 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY OF GETTING YOUNG

02:27:27.605 --> 02:27:31.543 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN AND OUT FOR YEARS.

02:27:29.808 --> 02:27:32.143 region:rollup2
SAVES US MONEY

02:27:31.543 --> 02:27:34.412 region:rollup2
VERSUS TAKEN SIX YEARS TO GET

02:27:32.143 --> 02:27:35.447 region:rollup2
OUT.

02:27:34.412 --> 02:27:36.681 region:rollup2
NOW THE SHE ISSUES ARE ALL

02:27:35.447 --> 02:27:38.383 region:rollup2
AROUND THE STATE AND THEY DO

02:27:36.681 --> 02:27:41.086 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL JOBS.

02:27:38.383 --> 02:27:43.021 region:rollup2
SOME TO LIKE IN MY OWN HISTORY.

02:27:41.086 --> 02:27:44.656 region:rollup2

BECAUSE OF CSU SAN MARCOS.

02:28:03.174 --> 02:28:07.112 region:rollup2
TO ME THIS JUST MAKES A LOT OF

02:28:05.276 --> 02:28:09.247 region:rollup2
SENSE.

02:28:07.112 --> 02:28:10.882 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS WHAT DO WE AS A

02:28:09.247 --> 02:28:12.217 region:rollup2
SOCIETY INVEST IN.

STAFF RECENTLY.

02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:36.880 region:rollup2
THE DELAY IN GETTING CONNECTED

02:47:34.811 --> 02:47:38.081 region:rollup2

BILL MOVES FORWARD TOWARDS

02:47:41.551 --> 02:47:44.488 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS. THE ISSUE OF

02:47:43.186 --> 02:47:45.789 region:rollup2
COST IS IMPORTANT ONE I DON'T

02:47:44.488 --> 02:47:49.092 region:rollup2
ONE UNDERSCORE OR I DON'T WANT

02:47:45.789 --> 02:47:50.994 region:rollup2
TO MINIMIZE THE THE IMPACT TOM.

02:47:49.092 --> 02:47:51.628 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUES CONVERSATIONS OF

02:47:50.994 --> 02:47:53.063 region:rollup2
THE POEM WAS FORWARD THANK YOU.

02:47:51.628 --> 02:47:55.465 region:rollup2
AND AND AND ANOTHER QUESTION.

02:47:53.063 --> 02:47:56.700 region:rollup2
TO THE AUTHOR OF.

02:47:55.465 --> 02:47:58.802 region:rollup2
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE?

02:47:56.700 --> 02:48:00.737 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SEE IS THE THE

02:47:58.802 --> 02:48:03.540 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. ABOUT.

02:48:00.737 --> 02:48:05.609 region:rollup2
ENTITY TO BE DOING THE STUDY.

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:06.543 region:rollup2
I WILL WELL I THINK FOR RELEASED

02:48:05.609 --> 02:48:07.778 region:rollup2
A COUPLE REASONS ONE.

02:48:06.543 --> 02:48:08.946 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IT THROUGH AN

02:48:07.778 --> 02:48:11.248 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC LANDS.

02:48:08.946 --> 02:48:13.250 region:rollup2
AND TO THAT AS A RESEARCH

02:48:11.248 --> 02:48:14.384 region:rollup2
MINDED INSTITUTION I THINK THEY

02:48:13.250 --> 02:48:16.320 region:rollup2
HAVE THE.

02:48:14.384 --> 02:48:17.888 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE TO BE

02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:19.289 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET US TO WHERE I THINK

02:48:17.888 --> 02:48:20.724 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE ON THIS IN TERMS

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:22.759 region:rollup2
OF GATHERING INFORMATION.

02:48:20.724 --> 02:48:25.162 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:48:22.759 --> 02:48:26.296 region:rollup2
IN A PERFECT WORLD. A VOTE

02:48:25.162 --> 02:48:28.665 region:rollup2
PERFECT WORLD THIS WOULD BE AN

02:48:26.296 --> 02:48:30.601 region:rollup2
ISSUE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT.

02:48:28.665 --> 02:48:32.069 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A SILICON VALLEY

02:48:30.601 --> 02:48:33.937 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:48:32.069 --> 02:48:35.238 region:rollup2
ENGAGING WITH US AND I WILL SAY

02:48:33.937 --> 02:48:36.740 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE STARTING

02:48:35.238 --> 02:48:38.308 region:rollup2
TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION AROUND

02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:40.510 region:rollup2
THE TOPIC.

02:48:38.308 --> 02:48:43.013 region:rollup2
BICU IT. IN THAT PERFECT

02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:43.847 region:rollup2
WORLD LOOK TO SEE THEM TAKE ON

02:48:43.013 --> 02:48:46.483 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES THAT WOULD WOULD

02:48:43.847 --> 02:48:48.185 region:rollup2
CREATE. A MORE OPEN DOOR POLICY

02:48:46.483 --> 02:48:49.353 region:rollup2
AND A CULTURE THAT WAS LOOKING

02:48:48.185 --> 02:48:50.520 region:rollup2
TO BRING IN.

02:48:49.353 --> 02:48:53.557 region:rollup2
OF THE KIND OF DIVERSITY THAT

02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:55.459 region:rollup2
THE STATE ATTACKS WE PRIDE IN. A

02:48:53.557 --> 02:48:56.793 region:rollup2
BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WE

02:48:55.459 --> 02:48:58.128 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THE UC'S PROVIDE

02:48:56.793 --> 02:49:00.397 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL

02:48:58.128 --> 02:49:01.231 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE ACADEMIC STRUCTURE AND

02:49:00.397 --> 02:49:02.833 region:rollup2
WE.

02:49:01.231 --> 02:49:04.234 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO DO THE KIND OF

02:49:02.833 --> 02:49:06.136 region:rollup2
RESEARCH I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL

02:49:04.234 --> 02:49:08.472 region:rollup2
TO US IN THIS PROCESS.

02:49:06.136 --> 02:49:10.040 region:rollup2
GIVEN ANOTHER. WEEK OR TWO AND

02:49:08.472 --> 02:49:10.640 region:rollup2
WITH THAT KIND OF DIRECTION THAT

02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:11.641 region:rollup2
WE COULD HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:13.310 region:rollup2
OTHER.

02:49:11.641 --> 02:49:15.145 region:rollup2
WAYS OF GOING OUT IT BUT.

02:49:13.310 --> 02:49:17.147 region:rollup2
I THINK BECAUSE OF THE

02:49:15.145 --> 02:49:18.415 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE.

02:49:17.147 --> 02:49:19.983 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

02:49:18.415 --> 02:49:20.283 region:rollup2
UC'S I THINK IT'S ALSO

02:49:19.983 --> 02:49:22.119 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

02:49:20.283 --> 02:49:24.755 region:rollup2
.

02:49:22.119 --> 02:49:25.989 region:rollup2
A RELATIONSHIP THAT WE WANNA.

02:49:24.755 --> 02:49:27.324 region:rollup2
BUILD ON IT EVEN THOUGH I

02:49:25.989 --> 02:49:28.291 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE

02:49:27.324 --> 02:49:29.826 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THEY WERE CAUGHT

02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:31.461 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL COSTS INVOLVED.

02:49:29.826 --> 02:49:32.696 region:rollup2
AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:34.197 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UC'S IN.

02:49:32.696 --> 02:49:36.400 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

02:49:34.197 --> 02:49:38.001 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT AND TO BE HONEST

02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:39.536 region:rollup2
WITH YOU THESE BUDGETS ARE SO.

02:49:38.001 --> 02:49:41.338 region:rollup2
SO VAST THAT.

02:49:39.536 --> 02:49:43.240 region:rollup2
ONE COULD PROBABLY LOOK AT A

02:49:41.338 --> 02:49:44.474 region:rollup2
LINE ITEM OR LOOK AT A TOTAL

02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:46.076 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

02:49:44.474 --> 02:49:47.911 region:rollup2
COST COULD BE AND HOW IT COULD

02:49:46.076 --> 02:49:48.979 region:rollup2
BE ABSORBED. BUT THAT'S PART OF

02:49:47.911 --> 02:49:50.947 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION THEY WERE

02:49:48.979 --> 02:49:51.515 region:rollup2
WILLING TO HAVE WITH.

02:49:50.947 --> 02:49:52.716 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS OF THE UC'S GOING

02:49:51.515 --> 02:49:54.651 region:rollup2

IN MY.

02:49:58.221 --> 02:50:01.324 region:rollup2
A LIMITED TRIPS TO SILICON

02:49:59.823 --> 02:50:03.293 region:rollup2
VALLEY IS AN ISSUE THAT I

02:50:01.324 --> 02:50:04.861 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP WITH THEM. AND THAT I

02:50:03.293 --> 02:50:06.663 region:rollup2

STUDY AS WELL THINK JUST AS A

02:50:17.841 --> 02:50:19.776 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION I'M NOT A. WITHOUT A

02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:20.844 region:rollup2
DOUBT.

COMMUNITY AND.

02:50:32.355 --> 02:50:36.893 region:rollup2
NOW WANTED PUBLICLY STATE THE

02:50:35.492 --> 02:50:38.261 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF THE COLLABORATION

I AS I REPRESENT SILICON VALLEY

02:50:46.937 --> 02:50:51.241 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION IS TO

02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:52.109 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A WIDE

02:50:51.241 --> 02:50:53.276 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF DIVERSITY TO

02:50:52.109 --> 02:50:54.978 region:rollup2
CELEBRATE THE STRENGTH OF THE

02:50:53.276 --> 02:50:56.179 region:rollup2
VERSION THAT. WILL BE REFLECTIVE

02:50:54.978 --> 02:50:58.548 region:rollup2
OF SOCIETY.

02:50:56.179 --> 02:51:00.317 region:rollup2
BUT THE SENSE OF THAT THE THE.

02:50:58.548 --> 02:51:02.185 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION AND AUTHORITY

02:51:00.317 --> 02:51:04.354 region:rollup2
WITH YOU SEE TO HOWEVER BECAUSE

02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:06.156 region:rollup2
A TO TO GET THIS INFORMATION AND

02:51:04.354 --> 02:51:07.290 region:rollup2
THE DATA FROM TECH COMPANIES.

02:51:06.156 --> 02:51:08.859 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU FORESEE THE YOU SEE

02:51:07.290 --> 02:51:10.460 region:rollup2
HAVING THE CAPACITY IN THAT SORT

02:51:08.859 --> 02:51:12.529 region:rollup2
OF THE TEETH TO BE ABLE TO. DO

02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:14.764 region:rollup2
THAT MY APOLOGIES IF A YOUR TO

02:51:12.529 --> 02:51:16.766 region:rollup2
ANSWER THAT EARLIER.

02:51:14.764 --> 02:51:18.769 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK YOUR. WELL SORT OF

02:51:16.766 --> 02:51:20.370 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY I THINK THE POINT IS

02:51:18.769 --> 02:51:21.805 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO THE

02:51:20.370 --> 02:51:23.840 region:rollup2
UC'S BECAUSE YOU SEE IS.

02:51:21.805 --> 02:51:25.342 region:rollup2
OUR RESEARCH INTENSIVE IN TERMS

02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:27.711 region:rollup2
OF HOW THEY.

02:51:25.342 --> 02:51:29.379 region:rollup2
THERE JUST TO THE FABRIC OF HOW

02:51:27.711 --> 02:51:31.047 region:rollup2
THE INSTITUTIONS PUT TOGETHER SO

02:51:29.379 --> 02:51:33.650 region:rollup2
WE SEE THAT AS AN ASSET AND.

02:51:31.047 --> 02:51:35.886 region:rollup2
VALUABLE ASSET AND I THINK THAT

02:51:33.650 --> 02:51:37.654 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST ON THIS

02:51:35.886 --> 02:51:39.956 region:rollup2
INITIAL GLIMPSE THE MOST

02:51:37.654 --> 02:51:41.658 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

02:51:39.956 --> 02:51:43.126 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS THAT DID THE BUT

02:51:41.658 --> 02:51:45.695 region:rollup2
THAT THINK THE CAPACITY THAT THE

02:51:43.126 --> 02:51:46.930 region:rollup2
UC HAS TO TO TO GET THIS

02:51:45.695 --> 02:51:48.498 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:51:46.930 --> 02:51:50.767 region:rollup2
IT ABOUT

02:51:48.498 --> 02:51:52.235 region:rollup2
CAN YOU HELP EXPLAIN PERHAPS

02:51:50.767 --> 02:51:53.737 region:rollup2
WHERE THE UC HAS THE HOW. TO

02:51:52.235 --> 02:51:55.405 region:rollup2
WORK FORTY TWO THEY HAVE TO

02:51:53.737 --> 02:51:56.940 region:rollup2
DEMAND THIS INFORMATION FROM

02:51:55.405 --> 02:51:58.975 region:rollup2
THEM SOMEONE WILL A LOT OF THE

02:51:56.940 --> 02:52:00.043 region:rollup2
RESEARCH IS A LOT OF THE DATA IS

02:51:58.975 --> 02:52:01.645 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

02:52:00.043 --> 02:52:03.380 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE THERE

02:52:01.645 --> 02:52:04.414 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NECESSARILY CREATING

02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:05.982 region:rollup2
THE DATA IT'S BASICALLY

02:52:04.414 --> 02:52:07.350 region:rollup2
COLLECTING THE DATA WHICH HAS

02:52:05.982 --> 02:52:09.753 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN.

02:52:07.350 --> 02:52:10.287 region:rollup2
DIGNIFIED AS I MENTIONED IN MY

02:52:09.753 --> 02:52:11.721 region:rollup2
MY TALKING POINTS THERE'S

02:52:10.287 --> 02:52:14.591 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

02:52:11.721 --> 02:52:16.693 region:rollup2
SOME RECORD RECOGNITION OF WHAT

02:52:14.591 --> 02:52:19.496 region:rollup2
THE PERCENTAGES ARE VARIOUS.

02:52:16.693 --> 02:52:21.231 region:rollup2
IMPACTED GROUPS AND HOW THEY

02:52:19.496 --> 02:52:22.566 region:rollup2
ARE NOT EMPLOYED WITHIN CERTAIN

02:52:21.231 --> 02:52:24.935 region:rollup2
TECH COMPANIES WITHIN THE AT

02:52:22.566 --> 02:52:26.236 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT REGION AND SO WHERE.

02:52:24.935 --> 02:52:27.771 region:rollup2
LOOKING AND HOPING THAT WE WOULD

02:52:26.236 --> 02:52:29.606 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO DRAW UPON EXISTING

02:52:27.771 --> 02:52:30.941 region:rollup2
DATA TO HELP IN TERMS OF.

02:52:29.606 --> 02:52:33.076 region:rollup2
FASHIONING SOME UNDERSTANDING OF

02:52:30.941 --> 02:52:34.544 region:rollup2
HOW TO MOVE FORWARD GREAT WELL I

02:52:33.076 --> 02:52:35.612 region:rollup2
I AM GOT IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL

02:52:34.544 --> 02:52:37.180 region:rollup2
A BILL IN THIS PIECE OF

02:52:35.612 --> 02:52:38.715 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AND HOPE THAT THE

ANOTHER FIVE OR SIX YEARS. TO

03:10:47.436 --> 03:10:50.205 region:rollup2
CHANGE THEIR SOFTWARE AND IT'S

03:10:49.204 --> 03:10:51.573 region:rollup2
GONNA TAKE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

03:10:50.205 --> 03:10:53.409 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS.

03:10:51.573 --> 03:10:55.978 region:rollup2
THE MORE WE PERPETUATE THAT

03:10:53.409 --> 03:10:57.713 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF STARVING OUR STATE OF

03:10:55.978 --> 03:10:58.280 region:rollup2
HAVING TO RELY ON FULL SO

03:10:57.713 --> 03:10:59.281 region:rollup2
SECURITY NUMBERS THE MORE WE

03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:01.617 region:rollup2
ARE.

03:10:59.281 --> 03:11:03.852 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO CREATE A COSTLY

03:11:01.617 --> 03:11:05.220 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. AND SEE WHERE I WOULD

03:11:03.852 --> 03:11:06.956 region:rollup2
BE CONCERNED IS THAT THIS IS

03:11:05.220 --> 03:11:08.557 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE POTENTIALLY A VALID

03:11:06.956 --> 03:11:10.960 region:rollup2
REPORTING THAT WE'RE GOING TO

03:11:08.557 --> 03:11:12.761 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE. BUT. RIGHT NOW EDTA

03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:14.830 region:rollup2
IS TRYING TO CHANGE OVER A SIX

03:11:12.761 --> 03:11:15.864 region:rollup2
YEAR PROCESS ITS COMPUTERS IF

03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:16.966 region:rollup2
THEY COME TO US AGAIN AND SAY

03:11:15.864 --> 03:11:18.600 region:rollup2
WELL WE IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN

03:11:16.966 --> 03:11:19.168 region:rollup2
MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE

03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:20.536 region:rollup2
GETTING ALL THIS INFORMATION

03:11:19.168 --> 03:11:22.338 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS

03:11:20.536 --> 03:11:23.872 region:rollup2
REPORT. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

03:11:22.338 --> 03:11:25.674 region:rollup2
FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER FOR

03:11:23.872 --> 03:11:27.743 region:rollup2
THAT AND SO WE CAN'T CHANGE THIS

03:11:25.674 --> 03:11:30.045 region:rollup2
PART OF OUR CODE OR IT JUST

03:11:27.743 --> 03:11:31.146 region:rollup2
MAKES IT TAKE LONGER. COST MORE

03:11:30.045 --> 03:11:31.647 region:rollup2
AND CONTINUE TO EXPOSE OUR

03:11:31.146 --> 03:11:33.582 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS TO PRIVACY

03:11:31.647 --> 03:11:35.551 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

03:11:33.582 --> 03:11:37.319 region:rollup2
AND MY HOPE WAS THAT THE LAST

03:11:35.551 --> 03:11:37.586 region:rollup2
FOUR DIGITS WE'RE GOING TO BE

03:11:37.319 --> 03:11:39.621 region:rollup2
REQUIRED.

03:11:37.586 --> 03:11:40.756 region:rollup2
.

03:11:39.621 --> 03:11:42.858 region:rollup2
YOU CAN EVEN WONDER IF ANY SO

03:11:40.756 --> 03:11:44.793 region:rollup2
SECURITY INFORMATION AS I RECALL

03:11:42.858 --> 03:11:47.463 region:rollup2
WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE.

03:11:44.793 --> 03:11:48.964 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE THAT THE DATA IS

03:11:47.463 --> 03:11:50.833 region:rollup2
ARE ARE AND SO WE WE NEED TO

03:11:48.964 --> 03:11:52.401 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME.

03:11:50.833 --> 03:11:54.703 region:rollup2
SO SECURITY NUMBER TIED BUT

03:11:52.401 --> 03:11:56.572 region:rollup2
USING THE FULL NUMBER AND AND.

03:11:54.703 --> 03:11:59.541 region:rollup2

03:11:56.572 --> 03:12:00.109 region:rollup2
I ET DE TO CONTINUE ITS PROBLEMS

03:11:59.541 --> 03:12:02.444 region:rollup2

TIME AND MONEY TO TRY TO DEVELOP

03:12:12.488 --> 03:12:15.357 region:rollup2
