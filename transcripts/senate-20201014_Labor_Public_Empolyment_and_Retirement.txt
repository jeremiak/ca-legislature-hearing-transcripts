FOR THE SECOND TIME IN TEN YEARS WE HAVE ASKED BDD TO STEP UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A ONCE IN A LIFETIME ECONOMIC CRISIS. AND DELIVER YOU I BENEFITS TO HUGE NUMBERS OF UNEMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS. IN MANY CASES AND IN THE FACE OF NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES EDT HAS DONE. JUST THAT. PROVIDING YOU AYE BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE IN DESPERATE NEED. IT'S A REMARKABLE FEAT AND I SALUTE THE EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT A DVD WHO HAVE MADE IT HAPPEN. YET I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SOME CALIFORNIANS HAVE HAD THEIR BENEFITS UNFAIRLY DELAYED OR DENIED WHICH IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ASKS MORE OF US. TODAY WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE KEY TO IMPROVING OUR SYSTEM ENSURING THAT NO OTHER CALIFORNIANS ARE LEFT BEHIND. CIVICALLY WE WILL HEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE WHO RECENTLY MADE IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE ET DES OPERATION. AND FOR ME D. D. EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ON THE FRONTLINE OF THE CRISIS AND FINALLY FROM EDT STAFF WHO WILL BE CENTRALLY INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TASK FORCE'S RECOMMENDATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS HEARING WILL BE A VITAL AND SIGNIFICANT STEP IN MOVING FORWARD WITH POLICIES AND REFORMS THAT WILL ENSURE THAT D. D. D. FULFILLS ITS MISSION OF DELIVERING YOU AYE BENEFITS IN A TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE MANNER. TO BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH OR SPEAKERS I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC. WANTED TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IN NOW. PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER THE ONE I GAVE EARLIER WHICH IS EIGHT FOUR FOUR.

HEARING LAST WEEK- CHAIRED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER AND- I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US TO LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT HOW- THE EDT IS WORKING TODAY AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEIR FACE WITHIN THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE- THOSE UNEMPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA STRUGGLING WITH THAT THERE WAS A GREAT HEARING PROVIDING GREAT INFORMATION- AND THIS HEARING TODAY IS KIND OF A- THE NEXT STEP IN THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GO. AND THE COVER THE AREAS THAT UP- THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT COMMITTEE AND ALSO THAT WE CAN TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- THE NEXT STEPS IN PLACE. TO LET YOUR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER BELONGED TO RICHARDSON SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS AGENCY WELCOME SECRETARY RICHARDSON THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY PRECIADO JR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE DID AS THE STRIKE TEAM- AS YOU KNOW THE STRIKE TEAM WAS FORMED BY THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE RIGHT. OF IMPROVE. THE PROCESSING OF CLAIMS IN MODERNIZING THE EIGHTY D. U. I. CLAIM EXPERIENCE FOR THE FUTURE. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY CO CHAIR THE STRIKE TEAM WITH JENNIFER PARKER WELL KNOWN. WHO IS AN EXPERT IN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY. I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR AND I TO. TO THANK HER FOR HER DEDICATION TO IMPROVING GOVERNMENT AND THE TIME SHE CONTRIBUTED AS A CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA TO HELP MAKE THE UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM BETTER. THE STRIKE TEAM ALSO INCLUDED A NEW TOM WHO LEADS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS A DIET. AT NIGHT HEAD OF THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION WE WERE ALSO SUPPORTED BY AN OUTSIDE EXPERT TECHNOLOGY TEAM. WHO HELPED US BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE OPERATIONAL PROCESSES WITH NET. AS OUTSIDERS WE WERE NOT BURDENED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RUNNING THE PROGRAM DURING A CRISIS. INCLUDING BRINGING UP NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS AIMED AT PROVIDING RELIEF DURING THIS PANDEMIC. SO FOR MOST OF AUGUST WE MET WITH FRONTLINE ET DE EMPLOYEES CLAIMANTS MANAGERS LEADERSHIP STAFF AS WELL AS MANY LEGISLATORS AND MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF TO BETTER UNDERSTAND PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT EDG AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. THE TEAM VISITED OFFICES AND SHUTTLE MANAGERS AND STAFF AND SPOKE WITH CLAIMANTS REVIEWED NOTICES REVIEWED CALL CENTER DATA AND LOOKED AT LIKE TRONIC AND MAIL COMMUNICATIONS SENT BY CLAIMANTS TO EDT. THE TEAM% OBSERVED PHONE SESSIONS WITH EIGHTY D. AND SERVICE CENTER REPRESENTATIVES AND CLAIMANTS TO EXPLORE WHERE BREAKDOWNS ARE OCCURRING. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE TEAM FOCUSED ON DATA AT EVERY STEP WE USE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE PACE OF CLAIMS PROCESSING TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND WORK USE. THE IT NEED VERIFICATION TOOL RECOMMENDED BY THE TEAM HAS BEEN INSTALLED AND IS MAKING IT EASIER AND FASTER FOR CLAIMS TO VERIFY THEIR IDENTITIES WHEN FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. AS ANTICIPATED BY THE STRIKE TEAM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TOOL HAS DRAMATICALLY LOWERED MANUAL WORK AND IS REDUCING TIME INTENSIVE PROCESSING THAT HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITIES OF CLAIMANTS. I AM VERY HAPPY THAT BOTH DIRECTORS TONG AND PAT AND I ARE HERE TODAY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE NEUTRALITY DAY. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED OPERATIONAL CHANGES AND A TWO WEEK RECESS TO IMPROVE SYSTEMS TO SPEED THE PROCESSING OF CLAIMS AND REDUCE THE BACKLOG. AS YOU KNOW THAT RESET ENDED A WEEK AGO MONDAY. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT EDT MAKE IT EASIER TO USE YOU ARE ONLINE BY MAKING YOU AYE ONLINE AND ASSOCIATED TOOLS WORK BETTER ON MOBILE DEVICES FOR INCREASED EASE OF USE AND INCREASED USER ERRORS AND DATA ENTRY SINCE WE NOW KNOW THAT. ERRORS CAN CAUSE DELAYS IN CLAIMS PROCESSING. WITH THE IMMEDIATE FIXES IN PLACE THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDED THAT EDG USE DATA DRIVEN EFFORTS TO PREVENT FRAUD AND ABANDON OLDER PROCESSES THAT ARE NOT BASED ON THE MONITOR TENDS TO DEFRAUD EDIE'S PROGRAMS. BUILDING ON THE RECENT IMPROVEMENTS AND DOCUMENT UPLOAD. WE ARE RECOMMENDING EDG MAKE IT EASIER TO UPLOAD DOCUMENTS TO THEIR SYSTEM USING MOBILE PHONES OR COMPUTERS TO SWEET CLAIMANTS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR FURTHER VALIDATION OF THEIR CLAIMS. AND REDUCE THE MAIL PROCESSING BURDEN ON EDT BEYOND THOSE CRITICAL STEPS WE RECOMMENDED ET DE SHOULD REVISIT THE BENEFITS SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT AND REIMAGINE IT FOR THE FUTUREIN WAYS THAT PRIORITIZE CLAIMANTS NEEDS THIS EFFORT DONE IN TANDEM WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION SHOULD BEGIN IMMEDIATELY. ONCE THE BACKLOG HAS BEEN RESOLVED AS A PART OF A BOLD CROSS DISCIPLINARY MILITARIZATION EFFORT THAT INCLUDES AN OVERHAUL OF ADMINISTRATIVE ROLES AND PROCESSES OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY WITH THE CENTRAL FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE COBIT NINETEEN EPIDEMIC TRIGGERED AT EPIDEMIC TRIGGERED AN UNPRECEDENTED VOLUME OF CLAIMS THAT HAS OVERWHELMED THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS SYSTEMS. AT ITS CORE THE DEPARTMENT HAS GROWN OVERLY RELIANT ON A SINGLE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO MUST PERFORM HIGHLY SPECIALIZED TASKS TO PERFORM AND PROCESS CLAIMS. IN THE LONG RUN THE DEPARTMENT MUST TAKE STEPS TO SIMPLIFY THAT WORK BY MODERNIZING THE PROGRAM TOGETHER WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT EDT EXPLORE THEIR OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY AND BEGIN THOSE GOLD CROSS DISCIPLINARY MODERNIZATION INVOLVING AN OVERHAUL OF ALL OF THEIR SYSTEMS AGAIN AND THEIR PROCESSES. I BELIEVE THE STRIKE TEAM HAS HELPED EQUIP EDG WATSON TWO NEW TOOLS AND NEW APPROACHES THAT THEY ARE EMBRACING AND IMPLEMENTING AS WE SPEAK ENABLING YOU AS LAWMAKERS ALONG WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEPARTMENT AGENCY TO SUPPORT EIGHTY. MANY HARD WORKING DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS HAVE LITERALLY WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK IN RECENT WEEKS TO BRING UP THESE IMPORTANT CHANGES AT EDG AND I'M EXTREMELY PROUD OF THE WORK. ESPECIALLY THE WORK OF THE EMPLOYEES EDG AND THEIR HARD WORK TO SERVE CALIFORNIANS AT THIS TIME. WITHIN MY AGENCY THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY. THANK YOU SECRETARY RICHARDSON- I APPRECIATE THAT TESTIMONY AND- WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SOME QUESTIONS- A LITTLE LATER IN ARE HERE ND I DIDN'T WELCOME SENATOR JACKSON AND SENATOR- MITCHELL FROM REMOTELY BUT I DID NOT WELCOME OUR GOOD FRIEND AND OTHER GREAT SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO SENATOR A RICHARD PAN WELCOME SENATOR FAN AND- I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE A- MEMBERS YOU MAY HAVE SOME.

ON THE SCREEN YOU WILL GO FIRST IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY. I'M AT THE STATE OF MIND IT WAS ARE YOU CRAZY AND I HAVE BEEN IN A PLENTY OF THE EDT- AS AN EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM OR VISIT IN FLORIDA ELEVEN. YEARS A FEW MONTHS- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A CROWD. PERSON TO BE FOR A TODAY BECAUSE THE THAT I PROVIDE ELIGIBLE KIND OF. WITH ABILITY. TO PUT THE FOOD ON THEIR TABLE TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. INTO A SINCE THE JOB SEARCH IN PLACEMENTS THAT IS NEEDED- I WORK IS ALWAYS BEEN ESSENTIAL. BUT THE DEMOCRATS HIGHLIGHTED JUST HOW MUCH THOSE OF US THAT WORK. AT EDT OUR HEROES. IN ADDITION TO MY WORK AND I DIFFER CAL. ARE ALSO A PROUD MEMBER OF SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND. SO I WANTED TO TAKE THE STRIKE TEAM FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND OF THE- ADMINISTRATING ADMINISTRATION KEEPS ME. FROM CREATING THE STRIKE TEAM I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE SENATE FOR ASKING US TO SPEAK AT TODAY'S HEARING. THE STATE DOESN'T TRADITIONALLY REACH OUT I THINK THAT THIS WAS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I HOPE TO KEEP THIS DIALOGUE GOING FORWARD AND HOPE THAT THIS IS DONE MORE FREQUENTLY. INVITED THE EDT A PLATE BY COMMENT OF OUR EXPERIENCES. WORKING AT THE EDT. THE DALLAS ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO AT IT DURING RECORD OF UNEMPLOYMENT. MY COLLEAGUE JOYCE MILLER OMENS WE'LL TALK ABOUT OUR WORK ENVIRONMENT IN OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. TRAINING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO US AND THE VALUE OF OUR WORKERS VERSUS CONTRACTING OUT. MY OTHER COLLEAGUE JOHN TO WORK WELL TALK ABOUT OUR WORK FLOW TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS AND HOW BOTH ARE LIMITING OUR WORK. AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE UNEMPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS SKEWS ME GET THE BENEFITS THAT THEY- NEED AND THAT THEY REQUIRE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WITH A LIFELINE FOR MANY- STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING AS HARD AS WE DO- WE WENT FROM WORKING AN EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY FIVE DAYS A WEEK. TO WORKING SEVEN DAYS PER WEEK UP TO FOURTEEN HOURS A DAY- YOU KNOW AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED TO DOING NOT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL WE NEED TO DO. WE HAVE SACRIFICED OUR HOLIDAYS WE SACRIFICE THE GAME NIGHTS AND MOVIE NIGHTS WE SACRIFICE FAMILY DINNERS. BUT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE MARCH IS SAYING PEOPLE ARE STRESSED IS REALLY JUST AN UNDERSTATEMENT- IN ADDITION TO THE INCREASED WORKLOAD WE FACE CONSTANT PRESSURE FROM THE MEDIA. AND EXASPERATED FRUSTRATED CLAIMANTS. WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING TOLD THAT WE'RE NOT PROCESSING CLAIMS FASTER NOW. THAT WE DO NOT CARE. AND I WANT TO SAY PRO THE I WAS IN. FROM THE- ROSTER BACK WITHIN THOUSAND WHEN RECESSION STARTED. AND I HAVE FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRUGGLES THAT IS AT THAT TIME BEING A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO SMALL CHILDREN. TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT I KEPT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD THAT I PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. AND THAT I WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM ALL THE WHILE TRYING TO FIND- AN ABILITY TO FIND EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE AT THE TIME I WAS UNEMPLOYED. DURING THAT TIME I ALSO BECAME HOMELESS- NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT ABOUT ME- IN I UNDERSTAND FIRST HAND HOW HARD IT IS FOR THOSE THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THIS TIME- HOW EXTENSION. OF THESE BENEFITS ARE TO THEM. SO OUR WORK CAN TO EXCEED OUR NORMAL WORKLOAD YEAH WE HAVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FOR THE TRAINING STAFF BUT WE EXPECT TO PERFORM AND I REALLY UNREALISTIC LEVEL. BUT WE TRY OUR HARDEST TO MEET EVERY DEMAND THAT WE KNOW THAT WE SHOULD IN EVERY CRITERION THAT WE KNOW WE SHARE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE RECEIVING THE BENEFITS THAT THEY SURVIVE YOU SHOULD BE RECEIVING. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STRIKE TEAM WILL MAKE OUR WORKLOAD MORE MANAGEABLE- BUT PLEASE KNOW THAT WE DO CARE- WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN. TO ENSURE THAT THE CLAIMANTS GET. THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. SO I AM GOING TO IT OVER CHOICE WE LOVE ALL HAS GO TO TALK A LITTLE BIT LIKE I SPENT. OUR WORK PRODUCTIVITY DEVICE IF YOU DON'T MIND. THANK YOU THE SCREEN. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EMPLOYEES TO STEP UP AND MAKE A COMMENT- WHITE SAREEN I AM AN EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WRAPPED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT DIVISION I HAVE BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT THIRTEEN YEARS. AND ALONG WITH MY CO WORKERS WE TAKE THIS JOB EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY- I'M ALSO AN SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND MEMBER. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE STRIKE TEAM TO ACTUALLY. HELP THEM SEE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FROM THOSE OF US WHO ARE THE FRONT LINE USERS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATED BEING ABLE TO SPEAK WITH THEM AND GET THAT OPPORTUNITY. AS MISS IRENE SAID. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE WORK PRODUCTION. TRAINING IN PARTICULAR WHILE AS THEY SAID THERE ARE LIMITED- LIMITED NUMBER OF A SPECIALIZEDSTAFF WHO ARE FULL TIME PERMANENT EMPLOYEES WHO DO THIS. AND CARE GREGORY DEAL ABOUT WHAT WE DO. WE ALSO HAVE. ALL OF THE LIMITED TERM EMPLOYEES AND PERMANENT ADMIN STORE BEING HIRED TO HELP SUPPLEMENT TO. ADDRESS THIS HEAVY WORKLOAD WE ALSO HAVE STAFF THAT WE HAVE BORROWED. BAY DEPLETED AND ROLAND HERE TO COME FORWARD FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITHIN. THE STATE TO COME HELP US OUT. FORTUNATELY BECAUSE THE RAMP UP IS SO FAST. THE TRAINING IS A VERY LIMITED TO BARE BONES BASICS. WHAT YOU NEED TO GET ON THE PHONE START TALKING TO CLIENTS EDT IS ALSO HAD TO SUBSIDIZE THAT WITH HIRING SOME TEMPORARY WORKERS THROUGH IT A SERVICE AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THE RAMP UP IS SO FAST THE TRAINING IS VIRTUAL. VERY LITTLE INTERACTION WE HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE BEING PROVIDED BECAUSE IT'S NOT AT THE LEVEL AT WHICH THE DEPARTMENT TRADITIONALLY PROVIDES WHICH IS CAUSING A LOT OF FRUSTRATION CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE A ONE PHONE PEOPLE WE HAVE LEVEL TWO PEOPLE AND THEN YOU GET TO THE SPECIALIZED PERMANENT PERSONNEL. THE LIMITED. CHALLENGING TRAINING DOESN'T FULLY GIVE. ARE TEMPORARY LIMITED TERM STAFF. I'M REAL SUCCESS WITH OUR CLIENTS AND IT PROVIDES A HUGE DISSERVICE TO OUR CLIENTS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFORMATION KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE AND BY THE TIME THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON A SPECIALIST THEY ARE EXTREMELY ANGRY FRUSTRATED CHALLENGED. BUT THEY DO ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK WE DID WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GET HELP SO WE ARE PROUD TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT THERE'S- BECAUSE THIS IS SO UNPRECEDENTED WE UNDERSTAND IT'S A CHALLENGE TO DO THIS BUT WE NEED TO WORK SMARTER. SO THAT WE CAN BE BETTER FOR OUR CLIENTS. WE ARE REALLY HOPING AND APPRECIATE THAT THE STRIKE TEAM RECOGNIZE THE SKILL LEVEL THAT ARE PERMANENT FULL TIME EMPLOYEES BRING TO THIS JOB. AND THAT WE REALLY DO CARE BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THERE ARE SOME. MARTYR WAYS TO DO BUSINESS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK KNOWLEDGE THE THINGS WE DO HOW WE DO THEM AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE SITUATION. SO I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AGAIN WITH OUR OUR TEMP SERVICE- LIMITED TERM PERSONNEL IS THEY AREN'T AS DEDICATED TO THIS THIS ISN'T JUST A JOB. WHEN YOU WORK AT THIS IS A THIS IS A LIFESTYLE AND A DEDICATION. THE THINGS WE DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE WE TALKED TO WE ARE OFTEN THEIR LIFELINE IN A VERY BAD PLACE. ANISHA HEARD MISS I MEAN SAY SHE KNOWS FIRST HAND. WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE ALL DO TRY. BUT WE ARE. A DEPARTMENT WITH LOTS OF CHALLENGES LOTS OF REGULATIONS AND WE REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A LITTLE MORE STREAMLINED. THAT THE STRIKING POINTED OUT WHICH WAS WAS PHENOMENAL- I KNOW WITH. RANK AND FILE WITH OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM EVERYONE IS STEPPING UP WE ALL WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK AND WE WANT TO BE MORE EFFICIENT FOR THESE CLIENTS BECAUSE- A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE FAMILY THEIR FRIENDS. THEIR THE PEOPLE WE SEE EVERY DAY THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WE SEE IN THE NEWS. WE KNOW THEY HURT AND IT HURTS WHEN WE CAN'T DO WHAT THEY NEED US TO DO. SO A LOT OF THE THINGS WE NEED WOULD BE INCLUDING. AND AN EXPANSION OF OUR I. T. TEAM SO THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY BUILD AND UTILIZE BUT MAINTAIN. OUR I. T. NEEDS RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SUCH A SMALL DEPARTMENT. THAT DAY JUST GETTING PEOPLE TO LOG INS THE THINGS WE NEED JUST TO GET HIM ON THE PHONE. IS SEVERELY. AND WE- REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT CHANGE. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US. THAT WE DON'T MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN. AS AS MR CARE SAID. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE'VE HAD HISTORIC. CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. AND I REALLY HOPE AT THE END OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND CHALLENGE THAT WE COME OUT STRONGER SMARTER AND BETTER PREPARED TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE GET ENOUGH.

CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AND POLICY AT EDT. S. FERRIS PLEASE MORNING MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME TO BE HERE TODAY MY NAME IS NANCY VARIOUS AND I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AND POLICY AT EDT UNDER MY PURVIEW ARE FIVE BRANCHES ADMINISTRATION LEGAL LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS PUBLIC POLICY AND THE POLICY ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMPLIANCE BRANCH TO MOVE BEYOND ALL THAT I ENVISION THIS POSITION AS ONE WHERE I WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE EMPLOYEES AT EDT. INQUIRES STAKEHOLDERS AND OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE IMMEDIATE PLACE THAT IS MORE PEOPLE CENTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THEIR NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES DURING A VERY STRESSFUL TIME FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES I WANT YOU NEED TO BE KNOWN AS THE AGENCY THAT HELPS CALIFORNIANS IN NEED TO GET THE RESOURCES AND BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO YOU QUICKLY AND WITH EMPATHY. I KNOW THE FOCUS IN THIS MOMENT IS ON UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS BUT HOLISTICALLY SPEAKING THERE ARE OTHER AREAS THAT DESERVE ATTENTION AS WELL STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE WORKFORCE SERVICES PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE SENATORS HERE ESPECIALLY SENATOR JACKSON FOR YOUR HARD WORK TO GET YOUR EXPANSION BILL TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND SIGN THIS YEAR. WE THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE INTERCONNECTED AND NOT NECESSARILY. SEPARATE AND APART FROM ONE ANOTHER. I HAVE BEEN EDITED NOW FOR THREE. RIGHT AFTER THE DESTROY TEAM WORK WAS FOR. PRIOR TO THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW I WAS AT SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND REPRESENTING THE VERY EMPLOYEES THAT WORK AT EDT THAT WERE ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL THAT JUST SPOKE. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. TO NOT ONLY HEAR WHAT THE EMPLOYEES HAVE TO SAY BUT TO REALLY LISTEN TO ME THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE HEARING IN THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS. THEIR INSIGHT IS ESSENTIAL TO PUTTING INDIANA SUCCESSFUL PATH IT IS DEFINITELY THE WAY FORWARD. ALTHOUGH GRATEFULLY I PERSONALLY HAVE NEVER FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS LIKE SOME OF THE MEMBERS ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL. I DO KNOW FIRSTHAND THE EFFECTS OF HAVING A PARENT LAID OFF AND HAVING THAT PARENT APPLY FOR YOU LIKE. I CAN RELATE TO THE ANGUISH THAT PEOPLE GO THROUGH THAT MY PARENTS WENT THROUGH. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO HIDE THAT DISTRESS FROM THEIR KIDS NO AVAIL OF COURSE. I UNDERSTAND WHAT FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ARE GOING THROUGH. THIS PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT. WORKERS THAT MOST OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC NEVER THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT. BEFORE FAST FOOD WORKERS GROCERY STORE WORKERS HEALTHCARE WORKERS. CUSTODIANS LIKE MY DAD. LOTS OF PEOPLE TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BUT NOW WE TALK ABOUT THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE TALK ABOUT THEM AS HEROES AS MISS IRENE MENTIONS. WELL I CONSIDER MY FRIENDS ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL HEROES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. THEY SERVE REGULAR PEOPLE LIKE MY MOM WHO THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN HAVE LOST A JOB AND MAYBE YOU'RE WONDERING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD. TO PAY THE BILLS NEXT MONTH SH I CANNOT THANK THEM ENOUGH FOR THEIR DEDICATION BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS NOT EASY. THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD PARTNER DROP MY PREVIOUS WORK AT LOCAL ONE THOUSAND AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT COLLABORATION IN MY NEW ROLE. AND PART OF THAT IS GOING TO FALL ON ME I'M GONNA NEED TO UPDATE THE LEGISLATURE AT THE GOOD AND THE BAD. MAYBE MORE THAN YOU WANT MAYBE MORE THAN I WANT. BUT WE NEED TO STAY CONNECTED ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR CALIFORNIANS. I WILL ADMIT I DON'T HAVE THE- I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS ESPECIALLY NOT THREE WEEKS AND- I'M- AND I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT TOGETHER. WE CAN COME UP WITH THE ANSWERS. I THINK THAT THIS IS BIGGER THAN EATING DEER THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS ABOUT FAMILIES TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. DURING AN UNPRECEDENTED UNPRECEDENTED TIME IN HISTORY. IN ADDITION TO THE LEGISLATURE I NEED TO BRING IN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS RIGHT THE WORKERS I ET DE. ADVOCACY GROUPS EMPLOYERS WE ALL NEED TO BE ABLE TO SIT AT THE SAME TABLE AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TOGETHER AND QUICKLY. AND IF MY TIME IN LABOR HAS TAUGHT ME ANYTHING IT IS THAT PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS WITH DIFFERENT VIEWS CAN WORK TOGETHER AND WHILE EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN INTEREST AT HEART. EVERYONE CAN AGREE THAT SERVING THOSE CALIFORNIANS IN NEED IS PARAMOUNT TO ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL INTEREST ALONE. I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO MENTION THE FULL SUPPORT OF SECRETARY STEPHEN ALWAYS THAT LABOR AGENCY AND OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TALENT BROUGHT INTO BOTH INDIAN LABOR AGENCY OVER THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS SIX WEEKS OR SO. AND I'M ALREADY SO IMPRESSED BY EVERYONE'S DEDICATION TO ENSURING THAT EDT IS SET ON A PATH TO SUCCESS. WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING TOGETHER HOLDING EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE AND MORE. IMPORTANTLY HOLDING OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE. AND I'M SURE AS ALL OF YOU. THERE WOULD AGREE WE DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THE WRONG PATH EVEN WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS I DON'T WANT TO BE SITTING HERE AGAIN IN A YEAR TELLING YOU THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED. IN FACT MY GOAL IS TO BE SITTING IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT IN PERSON AT THE CAPITOL IN MERE MONTHS TELLING YOU THAT THINGS ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. IN FACT I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE EDT STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WERE CRITICAL WELCOMED AND APPRECIATED ET DATE IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK RIGHT NOW SURE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT NO ONE IS AFRAID TO DO THAT WORK ESPECIALLY MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HERE. BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT ALL WORKING TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOST CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND THIS. CAN NEVER BE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. AND I JUST WANT ACKNOWLEDGE AS A FORMER DISTRICT DIRECTOR BOTH IN THE US. AND SENATE I WANT HARD. TAKE A- JUST A BANK THE CAPITAL IN DISTRICT STAFF WE'VE KILLING THOUSANDS. OF CONSTITUENT CALLS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE TOLL THAT THIS HAS TAKEN ON STAFF AS THEY TRY. TO HELP YOUR CONSTITUENTS ACCESS THESE CRITICAL BENEFITS. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE HAD SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK WE'VE HAD A LOT OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK ON OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEGISLATURE SUGGESTION FOR THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THAT- WITH THAT. I LOOK FOR DEPARTING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. YOU ARE A REAL NEWBIE HERE UP IN THAT IN THE SENSE OF. HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING BECAUSE OF YOUR EXPERIENCES BUT- IT'S A TOUGH PLACE TO BE AND- COMING INTO IT AND YOU'VE HAD SOME GREAT TO. READ COMMENTS SO THANK YOU. I NOW WILL MOVE TO CAROL WILLIAMS THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. THIS WILLIAMS GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CAROL WILLIAMS AND I WAS HONORED TO BECOME THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS EDT ON AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH. TWENTY TWENTY. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. MY AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING BRANCHES TAX WORK FOR SERVICES DISABILITY INSURANCE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. PRIOR TO RECENTLY JOINING THE GREAT EDT TEAM MY LIFE'S WORK FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS WAS ON IMPROVING THE TAX AUDIT COLLECTION AND FILING EXPERIENCE FOR TAXPAYERS INTERACTING WITH THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. THIS IS THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE I WILL DRAW FROM TO SOLVE ET DES BIG COMPLEX PROBLEMS. THEY LIVE TV WE GAINED SIGNIFICANT EFFICIENCY THROUGH AUTOMATION TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WE WERE VIEWED AND MODIFIED BUSINESS PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO REFLECT THE MODERN TAXPAYERS EXPERIENCE. AFTER COMPLETING THAT BUSINESS ANALYSIS WE BROUGHT IN AUTOMATION AND THIS IS DEFINITELY A CONTINUOUS PROCESS. THIS WAS A PROCESS I USED WHEN I OVERSAW THE BACKLOG IN RESOLUTION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF TAXPAYERS CORRESPONDENCE THIS BACK WHAT HAD CONSEQUENCES. ONE OF THEM LEADING TO PREMATURE COLLECTION ACTIVITY IT WAS ESTIMATED AT THAT TIME THE BACKLOG WOULD HAVE TAKEN OVER A YEAR TO RESOLVE AS A TEAM WE COMPLETED THIS WORK IN THREE MONTHS. AND PUT MEASURES IN PLACE SO THAT IT WOULD NOT OCCUR AGAIN. MY WORK EXPERIENCE WILL ALSO SHOW YOU THAT I BELIEVE OPERATIONS SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC. ET THESE CUSTOMERS WILL BENEFIT FROM KNOWING WHERE THEY ARE IN OUR PROCESSES AND WHEN THEY CAN EXPECT RESOLUTION. EIGHTY DAYS INVOLVING THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IS INDEED UNDER WAY WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO ELIMINATE THE LONG STANDING TIME CONSUMING PAPER BASED BUSINESS PROCESSES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I LOVE THE EFFORT TO LIFT THE VEIL OF OUR INTERNAL OPERATIONS AND WELCOMES TRANSPARENCY INTO OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC. IF INTERESTED YOU CAN SEE YOU HAVE TO BE AS AWARD WINNING BEST APPLICATION SERVING THE PUBLIC CUSTOMER SERVICE DASHBOARD ON THEIR WEBSITE. THIS PUBLIC FACING DASHBOARD ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO SEE SERVICE LEVELS AND WAIT TIMES WITH THE HOPE THEY UTILIZE THE FASTER ONLINE SELF SERVICE CHANNELS. WHICH I'M CONFIDENT WILL BE THE FUTURE OF EDIE'S WEBSITE. ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY CAREER HAS BEEN THE PAST FIVE YEARS WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH STAFF AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON WEEKENDS AS A CERTIFIED ADVANCED VOLUNTEER INCOME TAX ASSISTANCE TAX RETURNS FOR FREE. IN COMMUNITIES NEEDING THESE SERVICES AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT TO HELP IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL SITUATION OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. SERVING THE PUBLIC BY PROVIDING INFORMATION AND SERVICES WAS AN HONOR FOR ME AS WELL AS BEING VERY REWARDING. MY BRIEF TIME HERE DDD WHICH AGAIN BEGAN ON AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON THE PROCESS OUTLINED BY THE STRIKE TEAM AND AGREED UPON BY EATING. FOLLOWING THIS PROCESS WHICH SOME CALL A ROAD MAP I BELIEVE WILL LEAD TO GETTING PEOPLE THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THE STRIKE TEAM WITH THEIR LASER FOCUS AIMED AND STEERED EDT TOWARDS HUMAN CENTERED SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS AND DELAYS IMPACTING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THEIR COLLABORATION AND THIS ROADMAP THAT WILL ENABLE EDT TO MAKE BETTER BUSINESS DECISIONS USING NEW TOOLS AND RELIABLE DATA. WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND MAKING ASSIGNMENTS AFTER SOME ADJUSTMENTS WE REMOVED ELEVEN DOUBLE KICKS AND COLLAPSE THEM INTO A GRAND TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED RECOMMENDATIONS. TWENTY EIGHT OUT OF THAT ONE HOPPED OUT OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMPLETE. THREE OF THE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS DEEMED MOST IMPORTANT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. A NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO IMPLEMENT ID ME WHICH WAS SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED OCTOBER THE FIFTH. THE TWO WEEK RESET WHAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH ALLOW THE SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF ID ME THE NEW IDENTITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM. AND IT IS GOING VERY WELL. AT THE START OF THE TWO WEEK RESET PERIOD WHICH IS SEPTEMBER THE NINETEENTH ENDING OCTOBER THE FOURTH ALONG WITH THE STRIKE TEAM WE IDENTIFIED AT ONE POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE WERE STILL WAITING OVER TWENTY ONE DAYS FOR THEIR PAYMENT OR DETERMINATION. THIS IS WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS THE BACKLOG. THIS IS WHAT WE INTERNALLY REFER TO AS HUMANS WAITING FOR THEIR MONEY. OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NO LONGER WAITING. WE ARE ON TRACK TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. EDB EMPLOYEES ARE IN FACT THE JEWELS AND CHAMPIONS OF THIS PROGRESS IN SPITE OF THE VARIOUS CHALLENGES THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED. I WANT TO THANK IRENE JOYCE AND JOHN FOR THEIR TESTIMONY IN FOR ALL THE OTHER EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR INPUT INTO THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT. I REINSTATED AND I AGREE EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING FROM HOME REPORTING TO THE OFFICE AND SUMMER WORKING AS MANY AS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. THEIR EFFORTS AND WORK ARE COMMENDABLE. I BELIEVE THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONTINUED EXTERNAL COLLABORATION WITH THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BECOME MORE AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED. AND EFFICIENT. AND THE COLLABORATION REFERRING TO IS THE EDT WORKFORCE. OUR LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY OFFICE OF DENTAL DIGITAL INNOVATION AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE. I HAVE NOT BEEN HERE LONG BUT I HAVE COME IN THE WITH A LOT OF REALLY GOOD HARD WORKING DEDICATED PEOPLE WHO TRULY CARE AND WE ARE ALL GIVING IT OUR ALL TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION. EVERYONE IS TO BE COMMENDED I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS WILLIAMS AND THERE WILL BE SOME QUESTIONS- FOLLOWING THE- THE PANELS- WILL NOT MOVE TO MAURICE M. AND SO ON THE SENIOR ADVISOR CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY MR AMSEL. GOOD MORNING. MORNING THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MARIE SENSE ONE THAT I AM A SENIOR ADVISER TO THE SECRETARY JULIE SUE. AT THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY. I WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED WITH DDT DEPUTY CHIEF DEPUTIES HERE TODAY THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION AND THE EDT GENERAL COUNSEL. TO BRING MY EXPERIENCE OF NEARLY THIRTY YEARS WITH THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT LAW PROJECT. TO HELP THE FEDERAL GOVERNORS AND SECRETARIES SERVICE VISION I WAS A HUMAN CENTERED DELIVERY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM. AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL GOES FOR ENTITLED TO BENEFITS CAN ACCESS. THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AT THIS CRITICAL WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE BUILD A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL ECONOMY AND THAT YOU I. IS A CRITICAL PART OF THAT. OVER MY CAREER WITH NOW WHICH WAS DEDICATED TO SERVING LOW WAGE AND UNEMPLOYED WORKERS I PARTNERED WITH ORGANIZERS ADVOCATES AND AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TO STRENGTHEN AND DEFEND THE U. I. PROGRAM. I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD OF THE ROLE I PLAYED WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO EXPAND FEDERAL AND STATE YOU LIVE BENEFITS. FOR MILLIONS OF WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES HARD HIT BY MAJOR DISASTERS AND THE RECESSIONS OF THE EARLY NINETIES TWO THOUSANDS. THE GREAT RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND NOW THE WORST ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OF OUR LIFETIMES RESULTING FROM THE CODE AND I'M- BUT AS THE LEGISLATURE KNOWS ALL TOO WELL. IT'S NEVER ENOUGH TO JUST CHANGE THE LAWS. THE REAL WORK COMES DOWN TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. WHICH IS CREATING THE SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ELIGIBLE WORKERS CAN FULLY ACCESS THEIR BENEFITS. THAT'S WHY WE WORK SO HARD IT KNOCKED TO ALSO PRIORITIZE ACCESS LIKE IT'S BRAND NEW TRANSLATION AND- TRANSLATION SERVICES AND CENTERING MARKERS WHEN STORIES. WHEN STATES MODERNIZE THEIR U. I. TECHNOLOGY. WORKING WITH EXCEPTIONAL LEADERS LIKE SECRETARIES TO THE REMARKABLE LABOR AGENCY STAFF INCREDIBLY DEDICATED AGENCY OFFICIALS AND WORKERS AT T. C. B. T. N. O. D. I. MY HOPE IS THAT MY EXPERIENCE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO BUILDING. A U. I. SYSTEM THAT APPLIES THE HARD LESSONS OF THE PRIOR RECESSIONS AND CORBETT TO BUILD TO. BUILD ONE OF THE BEST U. I. PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY. UP FRONT IT'S IMPORTANT EXERCISE THE LABOR AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO EDT AND YOU I. SYSTEM IS ONE OF OVERSIGHT. DURING THE ROLLOUT OF THE FEDERAL CARES ACT PROGRAMS THE LABOR AGENCY WORK WITH EDTA TO MAKE POLICY DECISIONS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEW PROGRAMS. ACCESS TO THEM. OKAY THING ON THE STRAIGHT TEAM'S RECOMMENDATIONS WE ASKED YOU TODAY FOR A TIMELINE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL ONE HUNDRED RECOMMENDATIONS. WE ARE MAINTAINING CHECK INS WITH YOU NEED THE SUPPORTING ABG MAKING DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS AND HELPING TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE COMMITMENTS EDT HAS MADE TO IMPLEMENT ALL THE STRIKE TEAMS RECOMMENDATIONS. THROUGHOUT THE LABOR AGENCY IS PARTNERING WITH YOU NEED TO SET CLEAR GOALS ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS INSURE THAT THERE IS FOLLOW THROUGH ON. HIS COMMITMENTS AND HELP PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NEEDED. TO GET THE JOB TO GET THE JOB DONE. THE KEY QUESTION THAT I'VE BEEN TASKED WITH OVERSEEING IN MY ROLE AS SENIOR ADVISER FOR LABOR AGENCY. IS ARE WE CONTINUING TO DRIVE TOWARD THE GOAL OF A HUMAN CENTERED YOU I EXPERIENCED AS SECRETARY SUE HAS CONSISTENTLY EMPHASIZED. SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. IT INVOLVES REINFORCING THE MISSION OF THE PROGRAM TO SERVE EVERY CALIFORNIAN IDENTIFYING THOSE AREAS WERE WORKERS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AND ABILITIES ARE HAVING THE HARDEST TIME ACCESSING OR NAVIGATING THE SYSTEM AND THEN APPLYING ALL OUR RESOURCES TO WORK THROUGH-THE CHALLENGES TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THE PROGRAM AND MAKE THE CLAIMS PROCESS AS SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE. WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING BENEFITS TO ENSURE A TIMELY FASHION TO WORKERS WHO FILE CLAIMS WHILE ALSO BRINGING INTO THE SYSTEM ALL THE ELIGIBLE WORKERS WHO STILL BELIEVE THEY DON'T QUALIFY OR WERE OTHERWISE DISCOURAGED FROM APPLYING. WE WANT TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESS TO YOU I BENEFITS WHICH IS THE SAME AFFECTED UNION MEMBERSHIP HAS ON RATES OF ACCESS TO YOU WHY. FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT UNION MEMBERSHIP PROVIDES THE EDUCATION SUPPORT WORKERS NEED TO HELP NAVIGATE YOU I. SYSTEM. WHILE ALSO REDUCING THE STIGMA THEY CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH APPLYING FOR BENEFITS. THESE ARE VEHICLES BUT DISTRACTING MADE SEVERAL CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL HELP PRIORITIZE AND GROUND THIS EFFORT. FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE INPUT OF WORKERS IN FRONT LINE EDT STAFF. EDT AN ODI HER DEVELOPING IMPROVED CLAIM STATUS FUNCTIONALITY FOR WORKERS TO BE BETTER INFORMED OF ALL THE ACTIONS MADE ON THEIR CLAIM. WHERE IS IN THE PROCESS AND WHAT IF ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIONS THEY NEED TO TAKE. THE STRIKE TEAM ALSO EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE QUOTE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS FACING THE NEARLY ONE IN FIVE IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS OR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. AND TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF ACCESSIBILITY TOOLS THAT MAKE IT ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO NAVIGATE THE EDT WEBSITE. THEY CALLED OUT THE NEED TO REVAMP YOU NEED THESE FORMS TO MAKE THEM MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD. AND THE WEEKLY THE WEEKLY CERTIFICATION QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING FOR CLAIMANTS TO ANSWER DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN A SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE THE STRIKE TEAM EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR UNITY TO BETTER BALANCE THE FOCUS ON FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION WITH THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS TO TIMELY ACCESS THEIR BENEFITS. SO IN TERMS OF NEXT STEPS IS AS CAROL WILLIAMS INDICATED EDT HAS TOTALLY COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRIKE TEAMS URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO ELIMINATE THE BLACK THE BACKLOG. AND IMPLEMENT NECESSARY TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME CODE HAS EXPOSED AND COMPOUNDED MANY PRE EXISTING CHALLENGES AND INEQUITIES IN YOUR SYSTEM IT ALSO REQUIRES SERIOUS ATTENTION. SOTHE LABOR AGENCY WILL WORK CLOSELY MONITORED ADT'S PROGRESS ON MAKING THE CHANGES SO CLEARLY NEEDED AND SET UP ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FACILITATE AND ENSURE IT IS WORKING CLOSELY. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION AND OTHERS TO MAKE THESE NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS AND WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE OF SWELL ON THESE CRITICAL PRIORITIES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MR EMPLOYMENT OF FREESHEET THEIR COMMENTS AND THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS I KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD- AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE PRESENTERS- IN OUR PANELS BUT WE WILL NOW. BEFORE WE GO TO MEMBERS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I WANTED TO. REMIND THE- AND INVITE THE PUBLIC WHO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IN NOW. AND PLEASE DIAL THE TOLL FREE NUMBER THAT I GAVE YOU EARLIER WHICH IS EIGHT FOUR FOUR. TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX FOUR. AND WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THIS ACCESSCODE EIGHT TWO SIX. TWO NINE EIGHT. SO WE NOW BRING THE DISCUSSON BACK TO MEMBERS- SENATOR PAN- POLICE SAID YOU ARE HERE. AND THEN WE WILL GO TO SENATOR JACKSON AND SENATOR MITCHELL SO SENATOR BEN WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU- CHERRY HILL AND CENTERVILLE AND- FIRST OF ALL- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE IN THE STATE SENATE AND CHAIRING THIS COMMITTEE. I HAD THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF. COMING INTO BEING YOUR SEATMATE. IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND I THE ONLY NEW YORK HERE AND SENATE SO I KNOW THAT THIS YEAR. GONNA BE COMPLETING YOUR TIME IN THE STATE SENATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOUR LEADERSHIP FRIENDSHIP- DURING THIS TIME. THANK YOU. SO I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS WE'VE HEARD- TODAY I THINK I THINK THAT- IN RELATION TO THIS HEARING WE HAVE BOTH SORT OF SHORT TERM. AND THE IMMEDIATE ISSUES WE HAVE AND THEN PERHAPS SOME LONG TERM ISSUES TO DEAL WITH. THANKS ONE BEGINS BY SAYING THAT- AS I SAY. RECOGNIZE CENTER HELLO YOU KNOW WELL WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY ACTUAL ON THE FIRST BILLS I DID. EMAIL OUT OF CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH THE WORKERS. EDT AND I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS- FROM- D. E. WORKERS- FROM THE SCREEN AND SWITZERLAND'S AND MR TAREQ- BECAUSE- THAT WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT. RECESSION AND INTRUSIVE INTERESTING ENOUGH- WE'RE HEARING COMPLAINTS ABOUT PEOPLE NOT BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE E. D. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS IS THAT- YOU KNOW PEOPLE EXPRESSED A LOT OF ANGER WITH THE WORKERS AT EDT BUT WHAT. ACTUALLY IS I WOULD LISTEN TO THE WORKERS. WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS IS THAT THE WORKERS WERE ACTUALLY TOLD THEY COULD NOT HELP. FULL IN PERSON IN FACT WHEN SOMEONE TO SHOW UP TO A NEEDY CENTER THEY WERE TOLD TO GO CALL EDIE AND- WELL I HAVE NOT HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF APPLYING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT- ACTUALLY I'VE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAD- I DECIDED TO CALL THE PHONE LINE TO FIND OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I WANT TO PLAY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. AND I GOT TO EXPERIENCE WHAT SO MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO WERE STRUGGLING EXPERIENCED WAS IS THAT THEY WOULD YOU WOULD CALL IN AND YOU WOULD ACTUALLY GO THROUGH A PHONE TREE YOU KNOW TAKE ABOUT TEN MINUTES. AND THEN YOU CAN EVEN LEAVE A MESSAGE IT SAID THAT. THEY WERE TOO BUSY AND TO TRY AGAIN. AND WE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD CALLED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND COULDN'T GET THROUGH. AND THEN WHEN THEY WOULD SHOW UP AT TEN EDT OFFICE THEY WERE TOLD THAT. THEY CANNOT BE HELPED. AND THAT. THEY SHOULD CALL AGAIN IN FACT THE REASON PLAY TELEPHONE MUCH GO AND TRY THISPHONE AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW FRUSTRATED PEOPLE WERE- AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- EVENTUALLY THERE WHATEVER CHANGES TO ALLOW WORKERS TO HELP BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE DO LISTEN TO THE WORKERS ON THE FRONTLINE. NOW I DO ALSO NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WITH COVE IT- WE DID HAVE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMS HAPPENED VERY SUDDENLY- TWELVE POINT SIX MILLION I BELIEVE HAVE I GOT THE NUMBER CORRECTLY- AT LEAST THROUGH AUGUST AND THIS REPRESENTS A TWENTY SIX FOLD INCREASE IN CLAIMS FROM PRIOR TO CODE- APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THOUSAND CLAIMS A DAY BUT ACTUALLY I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT WELL CERTAINLY EXTREMELY LARGE NUMBER. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AT LEAST WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY- THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CLAIMS. IN THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TEN. AND THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY SO- ANYWAYS I GUESS- WELL SIXTY THOUSAND CERTAINLY LARGE AND FIFTY THOUSAND. WE DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT OUR BASELINE CAPACITY SHOULD BE. AND WE THINK ABOUT OUR BASELINE CAPACITY WE'VE HEARD ABOUT HOW MANY- TERMS OF SPECIALISTS AND- SO FORTH SO I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I DO HAVE- FOR AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S INTERESTING THAT- I THINK. OF ALL THE THREE PEOPLE PRESENTED FROM DDD I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY ON THE JOB. PRIOR TO AUGUST. AND THE COVE IT STARTED. SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THEN- SO- BUT- MAYBE WE CAN HAVE YOU SPEAK TO HOW MANY'S DO WE TALK MADE REFERENCE TO SPECIALIST PERSONNEL. HOW MANY SPECIALISTS PERSONNEL ACTUALLY ARE THERE EDT. RIGHT NOW AND HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO TRAIN SOMEONE TO BECOME A SPECIALIST. THEN I GUESS THE- THE THIRD PART OF THE QUESTION AND I KNOW THAT- MISTRIAL SINCE BOTH TOUCHED ON THIS IN TERMS OF SAYING THAT WELL WE YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO LOOK PAST RECESSIONS. HOW MANY SPECIAL SHOULD WE HAVE ON HAND. NOT HOW MANY SPECIALS WE NEED TO PROCESS TWO THOUSAND CLAIMS A DAY WHEN WE HAVE A LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. BUT KNOWING THAT. WAS COVERED WITH SIXTY THOUSAND TODAY IN THE HEIGHT OF THE- IN TWENTY TEN WITH FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY. WHAT KIND OF BASELINE CAPACITY SHOULD WE HAVE ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO IN TERMS OF PERSONNEL ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO TRAIN SOMEONE TO BE. A SPECIAL SO HOW MANY SPECIALISTS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. HOW LONG'S IT TAKE TRAIN TO TRAIN SOMEONE TO BE THAT SPECIALIST. AND THEN HOW MANY SHOULD WE HAVE ON HAND AT ANY TIME BECAUSE- WE HAVE A RECESSION YOU KNOW. IT'S THAT DOESN'T JUST. IT HAPPENED A PERIOD YOU KNOW WHAT. IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY TAKE A YEAR FOR THAT TO HAPPEN I MEAN OFTEN TIMES IT HAPPENS FAIRLY SHORTLY SO- PERHAPS A POUND OF CAROL WILLIAMS IS DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS- MARIE SAMUELSON CAN SPEAK TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. I CAN I CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK TO THAT THIS IS NANCY. OKAY SORRY- SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW MANY PERSONNEL SPECIALIST WE HAVE I HOW MANY SPECIALISTS WE HAVE I BELIEVE IT'S AROUND FIVE HUNDRED IF I'M LOOKING AT MY CHURCH CORRECTLY- AS FAR AS HOW LONG IT TAKES TO TRAIN YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE STRIKE TEAM. LOOKED VERY DEEPLY INTO- AND YOU KNOW THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EIGHT HUNDRED PAGE MANUAL AND HOW IT TAKES YOU KNOW MORE THAN SIX MONTHS ON TO TRAIN SO. THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE LOOKING INTO RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW WE CAN TRUNCATE THAT TIME LINE BECAUSE- WE DO NEED TO BE ABLE TO PAY THAT IF. ANOTHER PANDEMIC HITS OR ANOTHER YOU KNOW ECONOMIC. DOWNFALL HAPPENS. OKAY HI THIS IS THIS IS CAROL KAYE- BUT ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT- I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT BREAKDOWN OF THE EPR CERTAINLY CAN I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BUT THE TOTAL WORK FORCE PRE PANDEMIC OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT BRANCH WAS A LITTLE UNDER TWO THOUSAND- WE HAVE. AS YOU KNOW TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN LOAN FROM OTHER AREAS- ET D. AS WELL AS OTHER DEPARTMENTS WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO THEM AND WE HAVE A SMALL AUGMENTATION OF STAFF FROM A VENDOR. OUR PLAN GOING FORWARD. WE HAVE HIRED FORTY TWO HUNDRED TO DATE AND WE ARE HIRING AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND. THEY ARE WAITING ON. THE START DATE AND GET I CAN GIVE YOU WE CAN GIVE YOU THE BREAKDOWN OF THE NPR'S. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT TAKES YEARS. TO BE AS PROFICIENT AS IRENE CHOICE AND JOHN. AND THEREIN LIES THE DIFFICULTY AND THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATION BUT ESSENTIALLY SAID STOP HIRING STOP TRAINING SO WE DID STOP TRAINING AND MANDATE THAT EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY SPOKE TO THAT. AND WE ALLOW THEM. TO STOP TRAINING AND DO WHAT THEY WERE PROFICIENT- AT THAT TIME TO DO BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE MOST EXPERIENCED STAFF. NOT TO BE TRAINERS RIGHT NOW. NOT TO DO THE FANTASTIC- J. T. THAT IS REQUIRED TO HELP FOLKS BECOME PROFICIENT BUT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR DIRECT WORK BECAUSE OUR WHOLE WITHOUT QUESTION. IS TO COMPLETE THE BACKLOG IS TO GET EVERYONE THAT IS ENTITLED TO THEIR BENEFITS IT HAS BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS THEIR BENEFITS. SO WE CAN GET YOU THAT- SENATOR PENN WE CAN GET YOU THAT RECONCILIATION BUT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE ARE. AND HOW WE'RE PROCEEDING FORWARD THANK YOU SO- I GUESS JUST TO. I APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT'S WHY I SAID THE VERY BEGINNING WE ALSO THERE TO RESPONSE AND THEN THE LONG TERM. RIGHT AND SO I AGREE THAT. DIDN'T MEDIA NEED THAT YES WE HAVE NEED TO DIRECT EVERY WE'LL DIRECT RESOURCES TO. TAKING CARE OF THE BACKLOG THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING. THEY'RE NOT JUST WAITING AND KNOW YOU'VE DONE IT AND KNOWLEDGE THAT I MEAN THAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING RIGHT- THAT THEY'VE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR A WHILE THEY HAVE NO INCOME ALL RIGHT R. J. ME ONLY A PARTIAL INCOME THING WHAT'S HAPPENING OR HOUSEHOLD. SO THEY DON'T THEY'RE LOSING THEIR HOMES OTHER TYPES OF THINGS- THEY'RE NOT THAT SO. BUT I DO WNT TO TOUCH ON AND PERHAPS- YOU KNOW I GUESS THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE POTENTIALLY PROPOSED AND- NEXT BUDGET. YEAH WE DO NEED TO HAVE A DETERMINATION OF WHAT KIND OF BASELINE CAPACITY DO WE NEED TO HAVE RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE TELLING ME IT TAKES AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AN HOUR TEARING YEARS. TO TRAIN SOMEONE WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HAVE BOTH I MEAN I HEAR ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY AND OF COURSE PERSONNEL. THEN HOW MANY PERSONNEL DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON HAND. BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A RECESSION HIT- AND THAT'S A NORMAL INTERNET HAPPENS IN IN IN IT AND- NORMALLY IN ECONOMIC CYCLES- AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE SIX MONTHS OR YEARS TO TRAIN SOMEONE. WELL THE AVERAGE RECESSION IS ABOUT ONE AND A HALF YEARS. OKAY SO THAT'S SO YOU IF YOU DON'T PERSON IS ALREADY THERE AND THE REASON YOU ARE REDIRECTING PEOPLE IS BECAUSE- YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RIGHT. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT KIND OF BASELINE CAPACITY SHOULD EDT HALF IN YOUR OPINION. I CAN SPEAK TO THE SEVERAL MEETINGS THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS DEALING WITH OUR BUDGET TO GIVE YOU THAT AND PROVIDE THAT EXACT INFORMATION THAT THROUGH FINANCE AND OUR NORMAL BUDGET PROCESS. WE ARE ACTUALLY MEETING ON THAT AND WORKING THROUGH THOSE NEEDS SO THAT WE CAN BE TRANSPARENT AND ASK FOR WHAT WE NEED TO THINK YES THANK YOU. OKAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S A SAID YOU'RE HIRING A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT YOU CAN'T UTILIZE THEM BECAUSE THERE. DON'T THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAINED. THE OTHER. CAR IS THAT PRE. DE ID ME- AS BEING SORT OF THE BIG TECHNOLOGICAL LEAP FORWARD- CAN YOU SPEAK TO- THE- CARD THE- DIFFERENCE IN APPROVALS BETWEEN- THAT WE'RE GETTING WHAT I MEAN I KNOW YOU JUST STARTED THE WEEK. VERSUS PRIOR SO I UNDERSTAND THE 40% WERE BEING KICKED OFF TO MANUAL PROCESSING- THE GOAL FOR. WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THE ID ME AND- IN TERMS OF MANUAL PROCESSING AND WHAT'S THE GOAL- WE'RE WHAT'S THE GOAL FOR THAT WHEN WE HIT THAT GOAL FOR ID ME. PERHAPS DIRECTOR TOM CAN START US OFF. YES HAPPY TO- HELLO SENATOR PANNED OUT- HAPPY TO ADDRESS DESIGN A SPECIFIC QUESTION ON NINETY ME AND IF I COULD ACTUALLY LAY OUT A BIT OF A CONTACTS- INDEED THE AUTOMATION GOAL THAT WAS SET FORWARD SPECIFIC TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT BASELINE- IT AND IT'S A VERY YOU KNOW VERY MUCH APPRECIATED ON THAT ANGLE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY OUR ANGLE HERE IS TRYING TO PROCESS OR HELP EDT PROCESS AS MUCH AS THE- CLAIMS FROM AUTOMATED ASHION SO THAT REDUCES THE NEED FOR IBM MANUAL WORK WHICH REQUIRES FURTHER TRAINING IN THE NEW STOCK BEING BROUGHT ON BOARD. AND DAD REALLY WAS INSPIRED BY THE CONVERSATION THAT THE STRIKE TEAM HAD WITH OUR- STAFFERS FROM EDT AND IF I CAN TAKE A MOMENT TO PERSONALLY THANK- JOHN IRENE. AND IS WHEELER ALL JOYS BILL CONGRESS OF REALLY REALLY HELP US TO PINPOINT WHERE THE ISSUES ARE AND THEREFORE THE RECOMMENDATION WAS BASED OFF THAT. WHAT CAN WE DO FROM AN AUTOMATION ASPECT TO MANAGE THE MANUAL WORKLOAD THAT ARE NECESSARY- YOU KNOW REQUIRED BY EDT SO THAT THERE ARE FOUR THROUGH AUTOMATION. TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF MANUAL WORK THAT IS REQUIRED SO WITH THAT IN MIND- THERE WAS A- ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE. BASED ON THE CURRENT CAPACITY AND THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS A CIRCLE OF- BLESSED AND THIRTY SIX HUNDRED- MANUAL WORKFLOW THAT THE ROK EDT HALF THE CAPACITY WORTH SO THEREFORE AND AUTOMATION GOAL WAS SET. TO MAKE TWO TO ALLOW- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE NUMBER OF MEN WHO CLAIMS TO BE PROCESS TO BE UNDER THAT. AND THEREFORE YOU HEARD- THERE WAS ALSO OTHER COAST THAT WAS SENT OUT OF THE- ID VERIFICATION PROCESS WAS THE BIGGEST- BOTTLENECK IF YOU WANT. COURAGEOUS MEN NO WORK INTO YOUR REFERENCE SENATOR PAT AND- BASED ON THE CURRENT TODAY'S FLOW 60% OF THE CLAIMS THAT COME IN I COULD GO IN AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE A MANUAL FOR WORKFLOW. AND 40% DOES REQUIRE A MANUAL WORKFLOW. SO WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT ME WHICH- IT'S BEEN OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED- SINCE- OCTOBER FIFTH WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A PRETTY SOFT LAUNCH COUPLE DAYS PRIOR TO THAT. WE WERE MONITORING VERY CLOSELY HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE NUMBER OF MANUAL CLAIMS THAT REQUIRED A ME A MANUAL PROCESS- I'M SORRY I'M JUST GOING TO THE SITE- A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OR COUPLE OF. NUMBERS FOR REFERENCE NUMBER ONE FOR ALL OF THE CLAIMS THAT HAVE COME. INTO EDT THE FIRST OF THAT NEED TO DO TO DO. IS TO I TO IT I YOU KNOW IS IN THE APPLICATION. AND IN THAT. YOU WILL TAKE THEM TO AN ID ME IDENTITY VERIFICATION PROCESS IN IN THAT WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE DATA ALONG WITH EDT THAT 70% OF THOSE APPLICANTS WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED. THEMSELVES MEANING THEY SAY WHO THEY ARE AND WITH YOU KNOW SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION VERIFIED THAT INDIVIDUAL. MENACE DOES CLAIM SEVENTY FIVE OF 70% OF THE TOTAL APPLICATION. WAS ABLE TO CLOSE WITHOUT VERIFICATION AND THAT IN IN OUR- ESTIMATE IN TERMS OF- THE SEPARATION WITH THOSE CLAIMANTS THAT HAVE THE- I IDENTITY THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT VERSUS POTENTIALLY SOME FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY THAT WE VERY MUCH WANT TO PREVENT- FOR COMING IN TO EAT THESE WORK LOOK. NOW THAT WOULD CLAIMING THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED- THEMSELVES WITH THE ADDENDUM THE END OF THE VERIFICATION PROCESS THOSE CLAIM OF COMMANDS TO EDT AND TO BE SUBMITTED THROUGH THE U. I. ONLINE PROCESS. AND FROM THERE. H. OF THE CLAIMS THAT WERE AUTOMATICALLY FILED- THROUGH A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD AND THEREFORE DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT REQUIRES MANUAL INTERVENTION AND THIS GOES BACK TO YOUR POINT- SENATOR PAN. THAT YOU KNOW IF THE SENA OF THAT REQUIRES MANUAL INTERVENTION- IT'S MANAGEABLE BASED ON THE CURRENT BASELINE OF EDT THAT BAN AND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY HELPFUL. IN MOVING THESE CLAIMS ALONG- SO DIED PROCESS IS BEING MONITORED CLOSELY BY EDT AND THE EARLY INDICATION IS SIDE- IT'S GOING IN THE VERY VERY GOOD TREND. AND I BELIEVE- I'LL PROBABLY ANOTHER WEEK OR SO- THAT WILL BE MORE DATA- THAT CAN BE PRESENTED TO LOOK IF THAT TREND STAYS AS WE MENTIONED BECAUSE THIS REALLY JUST IMPLEMENT IT IN A WEEK AND A HALF AGO SO THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS THROUGH. A COMBINATION OF AUTOMATING THE IDENTITY VERIFICATION PROCESS TO REALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT NEED TO BE PROCESS MANUALLY SO THAT THERE ARE FOUR EDT ARE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE WORKFLOW AND CONTINUE TO MOVE. FORWARD WITH TYPICALLY. I HOPE THAT DRESS QUESTION. THAT'S HOW YOU DIDN'T QUITE TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU HOPE. THAT YOU SAID PER. WHAT THE ULTIMATE AND IS SET OVER TRYING TO IMPROVE FROM 70% OR IS THAT THAT I MEAN I KNOW YOU ONLY HAVE A WEEK AND A HALF OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. YEAH AND I'LL I'LL CLARIFY THAT ACTUALLY THE- 70% OF THE IDENTITY VERIFICATION PASSING RATE. WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT AND I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU DO AT. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A CLEAR SEPARATION OF THE DANITY VERIFICATION REGIME VERSUS THE EDT AUTOMATION RIGHT OKAY BECAUSE ON THE IDENTITY VERIFICATION RATE. YOU ACTUALLY DO NOT WANT A VERY HIGH NUMBER BECAUSE IF IT IS AND PERHAPS A VERIFICATION CHECK IS TOO RELAXED GRAHAM YOU WANTED TO HAVE. A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE AND ON THE NATIONAL STANDARD IT'S- FOR THEM LESS COMPLEX STATES IT'S ABOUT 80% OF THE MORE COMPLEX STATES SUCH AS CALIFORNIA- IT IS 70% IT'S RIGHT ON THE MARK. OKAY SO THAT'S WHY THE AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOAL IS TO GET MADE UP FOR THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM BUT OVERALL FOR THE OVERALL VALUATION TO. DO AUTOMATED PROCESSING FOR MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS ARE BEING SUBMITTED CORRECT. CORRECT AND THAT'S THE SECOND PERCENTAGE IS THAT AFTER PEOPLE GET THROUGH THE IDENTITY VERIFICATION- YOU KNOW MEANING THAT PART IT'S ALREADY AUTOMATED THEN YES IN THE STRIKING REPORT THERE IS A HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF 9890% CLASS. THROUGH THE REMAINING PART OF THE AUTOMATION THE EDT IT'S VERY MUCH WORKING TOWARDS AND I HAND IT BACK TO CAROL SPEAK TO THAT EFFORT- AS THE CURLY TREND. DATA IS LOOKING VERY GOOD OKAY. SO MAYBE CAROL ANSWER SO THE 90% IS OF ALL CLAIMS BEING SOME. MOVING FOR OR IS IT HIDING FOR OF THIS PERCENT THEY GOT THROUGH IT ME. WELL IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION WHAT WE ARE WHOLE GOAL IS THAT WHEN. IT'S ALL PART AND PARCEL OF THE SAME EXPERIENCE THE THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE COMING INTO OUR SYSTEM. FINALLY AND GRATEFULLY THEY'RE NOW GOING THROUGH IDENTITY VERIFICATION FIRST THAT'S ID ME AND WHEN THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL THROUGH THAT THEY RE ENTER THE ET DE PLATFORM TO FILE THEIR CLAIMS. SO WEIRD OUR GOAL IS TO LOOK AT IT IN ITS COMPLETE TOTALITY OF AUTOMATION MEANING THAT NO ONE HAD TO TOUCH ANYTHING AS DIRECTOR TOM EXPRESSED. WE ARE VERY EARLY INTO THIS PRODUCT PROCESS BUT WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THESE CLAIMS THAT ARE COMING IN WHAT WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THEIR DATA. THEY'RE MOVING THROUGH LIGHTNING FAST AND I HOPE TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC THAT. FOR THAT THEY ARE HAVING THIS EXPERIENCE WELL AS WELL AND WE'RE LOOKING TO GET THAT FEEDBACK AND BRING THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE 30% WHO DOESN'T GO THROUGH IT NEEDED STAT- WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM I MEAN. FRIDAY INTO A MANUAL PROCESS ARE THERE AND SOME OTHER EVALUATION THAT. CAN TAKE THEM INTO THE AUTOMATED PROCESS. THERE IS AN OPTION FOR MEN FILE WE HAVE SEEN NO GREAT CHANGE IN THAT AS WELL BECAUSE- IT IS TWO PRONGED SO AT THIS POINT- SO WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED ABOUT THAT THERE'S NO INCREASE IN THE MANUAL. CLAIM FILINGS WHAT WE'RE LEARNING- AGAIN WE'RE VERY NEW WITH ID ME IS THAT WHAT THEY ARE RESTING. IS LIKELY FRAUD. AND QUITE HONESTLY THIS IS WHAT HE DID WAS WHAT WE WERE NOT CAPTURING- UP FRONT. AND IN THAT'S INDICATIVE OF THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CLAIM FILINGS ONE SINCE WE STOPPED THE AUTOMATIC BACKDATING OF COOL CLAIMS. INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ID ME IF THERE ARE TRUE CLAIMANTS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH IT IT MAY HAVE SEVERAL ITERATION AND DIRECTOR TOM CAN SPEAK TO THIS FIRST HAND- OF HOW TO MAKE IT THROUGH. IF YOU ARE A TRUE INDIVIDUAL SO VERY FEW SHOULD. TRULY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE IDENTITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM BECAUSE THE LAST. STOP IS REALLY TO HAVE AN OPEN- EXCHANGE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL FROM ID. FROM ID ME THROUGHOUT FACE FACE TIME FACE CHAT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY CAN PRESENT THAT THE DA. THAT YOU'RE DIFFICULTY- GETTING PASSING THROUGH FOR VERIFICATION TO A LIVE PERSON AND THAT WE DID WITNESS FIRSTHAND HOW THAT EXPERIENCE WORKS. AND IT IS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL BUT BACK TO YOUR QUESTION THAT 30% WE DO INDICATE THAT THAT IS MOSTLY. FRAUD AND FOR THOSE THAT PERHAPS IT'S NOT WE ARE STILL LOOKING TO FIND THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT THOSE THAT CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH ID ME HALF AS EXPEDITED PATHWAY. TO GET THEIR CLAIM. FILED AND RESOLVED WITH US. THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW- THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT- TRY UNDERSTAND YOUR IT NEEDS A TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION. EVEN AS WE'RE STRUGGLING TO GET KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO NECESSARY EQUAL ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY- WHAT. WHAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE ARE WE PROVIDING PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE FULL ACCESS. TO THE TECHNOLOGY NECESSARY FOR. I NEED SO THEY MAY KNOW HAVE THIS THE I'M SMART. OR OTHER TYPE OF DEVICE DOES SO KEYS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT WHAT KIND OF UP. ARE WE I EDA. TO WHATEVER. OUR OTHER WAYS THEY CAN PROVIDE. THEIR DOCUMENTS I CAN SPEAK TO THAT DOES SENATOR PAT AND- AND THEN IF CARROLL- YOU KNOW NANCY ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO CONTACT ME IF YOU'RE FREE TO DO SO SPECIFICALLY. TO THE QUESTION ABOUT- ACT. ACCESS TO DIGITAL MEANS TO- GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS- NUMBER ONE ON. THE EDGE YOU KNOW BASED ON A LOT OF RESEARCH THERE'S ABOUT 96% OF THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. I'M SO IT'S 96% AT THE POPULATION THAT HAS ACCESS TO SOME SORT OF MOBILE DEVICE- TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT SUCH- OUTSIDE. OF IDENTITY VERIFICATION AND AUTOMATIC FASHION. SECOND TO THAT. IN THE INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT ACTUALLY NEED TO OWN. A CELL PHONE PER SE FOR THEM TO DO THIS. THEY COULD ACTUALLY BORROWED THE PHONE FROM THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND I'VE ACTUALLY PERSONALLY GONE THROUGH IT- JUST TO GET A USER EXPERIENCE THE PROCESS DOES NOT TAKE MORE THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES- AND THEN A PROCEDURE. THAT EVEN IF YOU KNOW IN THE CIRCLE OF FAMILY FRIENDS ARE NOT ABLE TO HELP HIM A CELLPHONE. OR AID A TABLET THAT HAS THE CAPABILITY TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR EXAMPLE AND- IT. AND THERE'S ALSO- YOU KNOW MACHINES IN THE COMPUTER SAYING A LOT. OR OUT AREA. THE COULD GET ACCESS TO THE TO PROVIDE THAT. EVEN IF THAT IS NOT ASSESSABLE AS CAROL HAS MENTIONED. IT ME ITSELF HAS A HELP DESK. ON THE CALL THE MEMBER SERVICE- THAT HELPS INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO GET ON THE PHONE CAL TO. ASK QUESTIONS AND THEN THEY HAVE A SECONDARY SERVICES CALLED TRUSTED A REFEREE THAT IS SPECIFICALLY HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AWAY VALIDATING THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE MEANS OF WHAT WAS DESCRIBED LIKE A MOBILE DEVICE OKAY. SO THERE'S- MULTIPLE LAYERS. OF HELP THAT IT'S BEEN OFFERED. AND TO EMPHASIZE WHAT CAROL MENTIONED. ALL OF THIRTY PER. THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE PASS. YOU KNOW THE GET GO THE STAFF THAT WE RECEIVED FROM IBM IT'S HELPED US IT'S ABOUT. TWO THOUSAND OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ACTUALLY HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE HOUSE DESK AND HELP THEM TO. YOU KNOW GET THEM SELF VALIDATED WHICH REALLY- BASED ON DATA INDICATED A LOT OF THOSE THAT. COULDN'T GET IN- OUR POTENTIAL FRAUD FRAUDULENT- CLAIMS IT IS VERY BRIEFLY- THAT CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY- YOU'RE NOW BORROWING SOMEONE ELSE'S DEVICE YOU A PICTURE. AND SO FORTH. FIVE MAY BE CENSORED INFORMATION. RIGHT SO AGAIN COMING BACK TO IN THE SCENARIO IF I DO NOT HAVE THE DEVICE AND I NEED TO BORROW FROM MY FAMILY REMEMBER THESE AT THE IT'S AND WHAT ITS REQUIRE STABILITY TO SUBMIT A DRIVER'S LICENSE IN THIS ASPECT AND THAT'S THE THAT'S A WORK FLOW THAT WAS PROVIDED AND BAD INFORMATION YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TO BE STORED ON THE PHONE AND THE INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE SURE THEY DID LATER ON THIS OUR DEVICE FROM A FAMILY MEMBER. OR ANOTHER OPTION IS SIMPLY TO GET ON THE CALL WHICH IS ALSO A TESTAMENT LET MYSELF- USED TO JUST HAVE AN ONLINE CAPABILITY TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS SUCH AS YOU KNOW- YOUR FINANCIAL LIKE WHO'S YOUR MORTGAGE COMPANY THINGS LIKE THAT THAT IS NOT REQUIRED TAKING A PICTURE OF YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE SO THERE'S MULTIPLE MEANS TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION I DO WANT TO POINT OUT IN THE SELECTION OF- ID ME- THE IDB SOLUTION IT'S A- FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION- ACT. THE CCPA AND THEN AS WELL AS THE NEWEST STANDARD FROM NATIONAL LEVEL OKAY. ALL RIGHT. AND I KNOW I KNOW THE UTAH THE THAT IS ALSO. THAT BACK WE'RE LOOKING AT JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- I APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES THAT'S A- STILL A LONG WAYS OFF I THINK. OF SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT BUT- PERHAPS- I WILL PAUSE HERE- MAY HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS LATER BUT TO ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES I KNOW IT'S TAKING A LONG TIME THANK YOU NOT YOUR HEALTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN OF THOSE WERE ACTUAL QUESTIONS AND- AND I THINK WE'LL BOTH BE FOLLOWING UP WITH AN APPOINTMENT AND GET A LITTLE BIT- LET ME GO TO SENATOR MITCHELL I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND WELCOME AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE YOU- CONVENING ON TODAY'S HEARING CENTER HILL IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS A LEGISLATURE TO SEND A STRONG SIGNAL TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND TWO ET DE. THAT WE ARE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE TO BE PARTNERS IN YOUR SUCCESS NONE OF US BENEFIT THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND THEIR ELECTED LEADERS WHEN. WIN IMPORTANT. GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS LIKE EIGHTY FAIL SOLD THE NATURE OF MY QUESTIONS ARE REALLY BE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE ALL CAN DO. TO IMPROVE AND DO BETTER. BEFORE I START WITH MICHAEL THERE. BACK PAM'S LAST QUEST YOU KNOW DOCTOR PAY AND- WE HVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO SOME DEGREE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ANY DAY THAT'S EXPECTING PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND SOME TOOL WITH TRANSITION ALMOST ALL OF OUR ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS. TO HAVE SIMILAR YOU KNOW REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE APPLYING FOR CAL WORKS IN CALFRESH IN SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE. AND EVEN TO THE DMV IT'S NOT JUST ANY DAY THAT YOU KNOW IS EXPECTED TO HAVE TECHNOLOGY. ALMOST ALL THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS ARE SO I THINK THOSE ARE QUESTIONS WE SHOULD PERHAPS BE ASKING EVERY STATE DEPARTMENT AS THEY COME FORWARD IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE TECHNOLOGY. FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY THAN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS THAT'S NOT UNIQUE TO EDT. I'D LIKE TO. THINK OF. GREEN THIS WHEELER MR TROTT- FOR BRINGING US THEIR- PERSPECTIVE FROM THE FRONT LINES I THINK THAT THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN FOR. CREATING SPACE FOR THE AGENDA VOTE TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AND I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE. WITH THE STRIKE TEAM- AND GIVE THEIR- NOT ONLY EXPERIENCE- IN THE MIDDLE OF CALL THAT BUT CLEARLY ALL OF THEM ARE LONG TERM EDT EMPLOYEES AND SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR- PUBLIC SERVICE. AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT. THE UNIQUE POSITION YOU'RE IN IN TERMS OF REALLY BEING A LIFE LINE FOR MANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SO I THANK YOU. YOU KNOW FOR MISS WILLIAMS- AS I THINK MISTER HILL SHARED ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL SHARE- YOU KNOW OUR OUR DISTRICT STAFFS HAVE BECOME YOU KNOW FRONTLINE A. J. IF YOU WILL. IN TERMS OF THE NOW THOUSANDS OF CALLS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED- SINCE MARCH AND I'VE SHARED WITH SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES I'M NOT SURE YOU THAT I- YOU KNOW FANCY MYSELF A FORMER DISTRICT OFFICE STAFF FOR ANYONE COULD MANAGE CALLS AND I COULD MANAGE YOU KNOW CONSTITUENTS- COMPLAINTS AND INTERACTION. AND SO I. STAFF TO THE DISTRICT OFFICE LINE FOR TWO DAYS. AND. THE STORIES THE FRUSTRATION THE FEAR THAT I WITNESSED FIRSTHAND REALLY IS OVERWHELMING. IT IT MADE ME RETHINK AND TALK TO MY SENATE COLLEAGUES ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR STAFF- WHO ARE WHO WHO ALSO ARE TRAINED IN THE SPECIFIC EFFECTS. OF WHAT YOUR STAFF TO DO AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU ALL INVESTING IN YOUR LEGISLATIVE LIAISON UNIT- I DO HAVE A RATHER LENGTHY LIST HERE THAT MY DISTRICT OFFICE STAFF PROVIDED ME WITH THEIR ONGOING QUESTIONS CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES EXPERIENCE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE UNIT UNIT I WON'T SHARE THIS IN THIS PUBLIC HEARING I WILL SEND IT TO YOU IN HOPES THAT WE CAN REALLY GET SOME RESOLUTION. BUT WITH REGARD TO WHAT WE ALL CAN DO TO MAKE THE LEGISLATIVE LIAISON PROGRAM BETTER- AND MORE EFFICIENT SO I MAKE SURE THAT. I FOR THESE COMMENTS TO YOU THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING IT YES LET ME GO ON YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ONLY OVER. ON ITS THE BOX TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH EDT TO IMPLEMENT THE STRIKING RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THEIR CURRENT PLANS TO CONTINUE THAT PARTNERSHIP BUT WE. NEEDED TO PROVIDE A FORUM FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. WELL I COULD DRESS ON MY UNDESTANDING OF WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THAT THAT'S OKAY THE STRIKE TEAM. ESPECIALLY HAS PROVIDED EDB THE ROADMAP AND BLUEPRINT GO OPS HAS DONE WHAT THEY WERE CHARGED TO DO MY UNDERSTANDING OUR CONTINUED ACCOUNTABILITY WILL WOULD BE WHAT. WILL BE WITH OUR LABOR AGENCY AND WE ACTUALLY DO MEET WITH- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE UP FREQUENTLY WE WILL BE DELIVERING A FULL STRENGTH TEAM- ROADMAP. REGARDING TIMELINES AND ASSIGNMENTS AND END DATES IN VERY SHORT ORDER AND I COULD JUST I JUST LIKE TO OFFER THAT TO YOU ALL AS WELL AS TO RECEIVE THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TRACK. AND SEE WHERE WE ARE WITH ANY LEVEL OF FREQUENCY THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT SHOULD BE DONE IN JUST A FEW MORE WEEKS SO- THE STRIKE TEAM ESSENTIALLY HAS- TAKEN CARE OF THEIR FULL CHARGING TASKED WITH EDIE'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY. WE'LL CERTAINLY CONTINUE. FORWARD WITH UP WITH PARTNERS. AND SO THERE WAS SO. I UNDERSTAND WHOLE CONTENT STRIKE TEAM AS YOU STRIKE AND THEN YOU'RE OUT OF THERE- DO YOU. SEE ANY VALUE- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE EVEN AS A AS A TOUCH POINT. IF YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE ROAD TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND- IN ANOTHER SET OF EYES TO DETERMINE EVEN IF THAT INITIAL RECOMMENDATION. ENDED UP BEING THE BEST IDEA AFTER YOU'VE GONE DOWN THAT ROAD I MEAN THEY WILL BE INVOLVED AT ANY POINT IN TERMS OF. IN EVEN IN A FEEDBACK LOOP OUTLOOK SPEAK I'M SURE SENATOR REGISTER SHE MIGHT STILL BE ON BUT ARE. ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT BECAUSE MOST OF THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT DID. HE HAVE AN ELEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION THOSE ARE OUR CLOSE CONTINUED ONGOING PARTNERS TO SEE THIS THROUGH THAT'S THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING HOW WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. SHARE SHARE ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH ONE QUICK QUESTION I HAD TO STEP AWAY FOR A SECOND SO I WILL PUT MY COLLEAGUES ASK ABOUT IT IS THE ISSUE WITH REGARD TO FRAUD- THAT THAT I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR BECAUSE I'M CLEAR THAT YOU KNOW. MANY LARGE SYSTEMS INCLUDING THE IRS YOU KNOW CAN FALL VICTIM TO PEOPLE WHO WILLFULLY WANT TO DEFRAUD GOVERNMENT WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE- I GUESS OUR CONCERN IS YOU KNOW HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AND ENSURE THAT WE BUILD A SYSTEM THAT MEETS THE NEEDS. OF FOUR CALIFORNIANS WITH VALID CLAIMS. WHILE BEING CAREFUL ABOUT NOT IMPLICITLY CREATE A SYSTEM WITH NEGATIVE BIAS I DON'T WANT TO CREATE FIRE WALLS THAT ARE SO STRINGENT. THAT VALID CLAIMS GET CAUGHT UP IN THE DRAMA BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO. KEEP THE BAD. GUYS AT BAY. AN IMAGE OF IS NOT FERRIS I CAN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THAT THAT IS ALSO A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE I MEAN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CLAIMANTS- GET THE BENEFITS THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO. AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE A AN AGENCY THAT. IS YOU KNOW STOPPING FRAUD AT ALL COSTS RIGHT SO WITH THE I. D. ME- WHICH YOU KNOW- DIRECTOR TONG AND YOU KNOW HAS HAS TALKED ABOUT. ID ME WE DO BELIEVE WILL PREVENT MOST OF THAT FRAUD IF NOT ALL OF IT. GOING FORWARD- AND IT IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOW BEEN LOOKING AT FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE IS HOW WE CAN. ADDRESS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CAUGHT UP IN THAT FRAUD AND HOW WE CAN GET THEM THERE ON. THEIR BENEFITS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE GREAT GREAT BECAUSE BECAUSE WE DID GET SOME CALLS THERE WERE PEOPLE WHERE YOU KNOW WHO CLAIMED THAT THEIR ADDRESS PLEASE USE THAT THEY AREN'T COMMITTING THE FRAUD. BUT NOW THEY'RE AFRAID TO BECAUSE THEY'RE DRESSES USED AND THEY'VE BEEN LABELED AS WELL- BUT YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT ID ME WILL HELP NAVIGATE THROUGH THAT. WE ARE. THANK YOU. WE'RE TALKING LITTLE BIT ABOUT A WILL. WHICH WAS A BUDGET COMMITTEE BILL THAT REQUIRED EDT TO CREATE A DASHBOARD WITH THE INTENT TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY BOTTLENECKS IN THE SYSTEM DELAYED ACCESS TO BENEFITS- TWO QUESTIONS WHAT ARE THE DEPARTMENT'S PLANS TO TARGET RESOURCES. TO ENSURE IDENTIFIED BOTTLENECKS ARE CLEAR TO OUR SYSTEMS CAN WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND SECONDLY- DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDED CHANGES AS OF YET. TO THAT DASHBOARD. SENATOR NANCY VARIOUS- SO I'LL TAKE THAT THE SECOND QUESTION FIRST BECAUSE I MAY NEED CLARIFICATION ON THE FIRST QUESTION BUT- WE ARE WE HAVE HEARD IT- FROM THE LEGISLATURE FROM STAKEHOLDERS- THAT D. A. B. ONE OH SEVEN IN OUR DASHBOARDS ARE A BIT CONFUSING YOU KNOWTHERE'S A LOT OF NUMBERS. AND WORDS IN THE FOOTNOTES ARE LONGER THAN THE NUMBERS AND YOU KNOW SO WE ARE WORKING ON INTERNALLY BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN AND WE SHOULD EXACTLY A CONVERSATION IT I'M ON THIS ALREADY- IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I'M I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING ONE IN THE SENATE TO ABOUT WHAT KIND OF CHANGES. MAKES SENSE I THINK YOU KNOW FOR ME I ALWAYS SAY YOU KNOW MY SIX YEAR OLD YOU SHOULD BE ALE TO DRAW A LINE AND THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I WOULD UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE BACKGROUND YOU KNOW OF ALL THE E. G. D. KNOWLEDGE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE SO MUCH SO THERE. WE ARE ANTICIPATING A LETTER TO THE JAIL BC REGARDING CHANGES WE DO WANT TO HAVE OUR REACH FIRST WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT JUST INTERNALLY AMONGST OURSELVES ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO THAT'S THAT ANSWER AND I'M I'M SORRY I SORT OF MISS THAT. THAT'S THAT'S THE AND THAT'S THE ANSWER ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE I AGREE SOMETIMES IN OUR EFFORT TO YOU KNOW- MOVE TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY WE MAKE WEBSITES AVAILABLE THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS. AND THEN WE SAY WHAT'S ON. OUR WEBSITE WHICH IS SO. IT'S NOT INTENTIONALLY. BUT IT'S NOT HELPFUL THAT THE DATA IS THERE BUT IT'S NOT IN SUCH A WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN CLEARLY EITHER MANIPULATED OR UNDERSTAND IT. IT MIGHT AS WELL NOT BE THERE SO THAT'S VERY GOOD TO HEAR. HI CHER G. L. B. C. I LOOK FOR TO ENGAGE WITH YOU IN THE PROCESS. AND RECEIVING THE LETTER SOMEONE MENTIONED EARLIER IT MAY HAVE. BEEN MISSED WE RIVER MEMBER. ABOUT THE SNOW THE NOTION ABOUT YOU KNOW RIGHT. AND I'M WONDERING ARE THEY MY ASSUMPTION WAS YOU SAID THAT WELL YOU KNOW MOST OF THOSE REGULATIONS ARE PROBABLY FEDERAL. BUT IF. THERE CAN AND WILL BE A PROCESS. I READ THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT I DON'T REMEMBER REFERENCE IN IT IF THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT. INDEED IF THERE ARE REGULATIONS THAT NEED TO BE UPDATED STREAMLINED. YOU KNOW I. FOR ONE GET VERY FRUSTRATED WHEN AS A GOVERNMENT. WE SAY WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT. AND YET NO ONE CAN WHY. AND SO I'M I'M NOT IN THIS MAY NOT BE FRONT BURNER BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS IN AND I WANT YOU TO HAVE THE RESOURCES WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET. APPROPRIATE NET CLAIMS OUT THE DOOR. BUT BUT- IS THERE A PROCESS OR GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BEGIN TO LOOK AT REGULATIONS AND PROCESS SEES THE FIGURE OUT. IF YOU NEED LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION TO MAKE IT GO AWAY IF IT IS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTIONIS WHAT WE CAN DO TO TRULY CREATE APPROPRIATE GREATER EFFICIENCIES CAROL WILLIAMS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I ABSOLUTELY CAN- IT TESTED THERE ARE THERE IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE TUNED INTO AND IT'S NOT JUST- REGULATIONS THAT MAY NEED TO COME THROUGH THAT STATE LEVEL BUT IT'S ALSO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE FOUR CORNERS HAS BEEN. AND WE'VE HAD VERY ENCOURAGING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BECAUSE CERTAINLY THIS IS A DIFFERENT TIME AND- PERHAPS THINGS NEED TO CHANGE AND BE MODIFIED BUT IT IT CERTAINLY IS A NATIONAL ISSUE BUT THAT WE ARE KEEPING TRACK OF WHAT WE'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST SO THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE PROPER CONVERSATIONS AND CHANGES AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I APPRECIATE THAT LAST QUESTION FOR ME SAID IT REALIZED PROCEDURE INDULGENCE. YOU KNOW WHAT. IT. PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE WALL AND THEY'RE AFRAID AND THEY'RE DESPERATE. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOU LOG US A HARD DATE OF JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH THAT YOU INTEND TO LIQUIDATE THE BACKLOG I AM HOPING THAT WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME THAT YOU'RE PROCESSING THEN YOU'RE PRIORITIZING THE OLDEST CLAIMED HIS FIRST. AND I'M GONNA BE YOUR NUMBER ONE CHEERLEADER HOPING THAT WE SENT YOU GIVEN A SPECIFIC DATE WHICH MAKES ME NERVOUS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HIT IT. AND ILL SAY HERE PUBLICLY WHAT I'VE SAID IN OTHER CALLS IS IF YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU THINK YOU GONNA MISS THAT DATE PLEASE TELL US SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. BECAUSE I THINK A PART OF THIS IS HELPING ALL OF US TO MANAGE EXPECTATIONS ABSOLUTELY WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUDGE THERE WERE TWENTY SEVEN. LET US KNOW. WITH REGARD TO MANAGE EXPECTATIONS YOU KNOW I REALIZE AS WE WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND- I'VE HAD TELE TOWN HALLS AND WE'VE HAD EDT PEOPLE. ON THE TELEPHONE CALLS AND I WAS IN THE MIDDLE TRYING TO FIELD QUESTIONS AND- WAIT- RECALL THAT WHAT IS THE WHAT WHAT THE NORMAL CYCLE OF A CLAIM WHAT IS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO ASSUME ABOUT. I APPLY WHAT IT CLAIMED COULD BE PAID. AND WHAT'S THE REALITY TODAY. THAT'S A FANTASTIC QUESTION- MY UNDERSTANDING OF PRE CALL WITH THAT THE BACKLOG GENERAL DIDN'T EXIST BECAUSE THE OUTPUT MATCHED THE NUMBER OF RESOURCES RIGHT THE CLEARLY THE ISSUES THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE WHICH IS THE MAIN WORK THAT FALLS OUT TO AN INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS THERE THEY- THESE ISSUES WEREN'T NEAR WHAT COME OUT OF IT CLEARLY WAS COLD AND THE NUMBER. OF INDIVIDUALS SEEKING OUR SYSTEMS AND CLICK AND CLAIMS. SO THAT'S WHY YOU WILL HEAR US CONTINUE TO SAY- WE'RE THANKFUL FOR THE STRIKE TEAM AND ID ME BECAUSE THAT MANUAL WORK WHILE I WAS ABLE TO BE MANAGED M. PRYOR CREEK OF IT. IT'S MANUAL IT'S TOUCHES IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL'S EMPLOYEE THAT HAS TO MAKE JUDGMENTS THAT WE HEARD FROM- EARLIER FROM. THREE BROWN PLEASE THAT. CLEARLY WE HAVE LATELY FOUND AUTOMATION CAN DO INSTEAD OF AN INDIVIDUAL THE RESOURCES OUR E. P. R. SHOULD BE WORKING ANY WORKING WORK THAT CANNOT BE AUTOMATED CANNOT BE AUTOMATED RIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES NOW IN LOOKING FOR AUTOMATION BEYOND THE ID ME TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE MANUAL TOUCHES ANY TOUCHES- THAT HAVE TO OCCUR IN ORDER TO SPEED THROUGH THOSE CLAIMS SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY. HE LIKE TO ANSWER IT OR AS AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S MY KNOWLEDGE TODAY. ANYONE ELSE HEY THIS IS MARIE SIGH I CAN TRY TO HELP WITH THEM ONTO ADAM THERE ARE THE FEDERAL STANDARDS IN A DIMENSION WHICH IS A RULE THAT REQUIRES THAT. THE 7% I BELIEVE OF CLAIMS BE PROCESSED WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS AND WE WEREVERY MUCH CLOSE TO. THAT MARK BEFORE CODE OBVIOUSLY NOW LIKE MANY OTHER STATES. WERE WERE WERE NOT IN THE SAME RANGE RECORD AROUND 5260% I BELIEVE BUT GETTING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR MITCHELL ABOUT COM. THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING REGULATIONS AND OTHER POLICIES I'M SURE THAT'S A THAT'S A SUBJECT OF LABOR AGENCIES BEAR INTEREST IN HELPING WITH THIS WELL OBVIOUSLY WORKING WITH THE V. D. N. AS KAREN MENTIONED. A LOT OF THIS- INVOLVES INTERACTIONS WITH THE LABOR DEPARTMENT AND HELPING TO GET SOME RELIEF FROM SOME OF THE EXTRA BURDEN THAT THAT ISN'T BECAUSE SOMETIMES WITH THE FEDERAL STANDARDS SO THERE ARE A RANGE OF POLICIES THAT WE COULD LOOK AT ME THE- REAL INTEREST IN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. OBVIOUSLY VERY CLOSELY. I WOULD YOU KNOW AGENCIES OUT ON. THANK YOU AND IT IS MY ASSUMPTION TO THAT THAT GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE WORK THERE WILL ALWAYS PERHAPS BE A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH THERE HAVE TO BE A MANUAL TYPE ACT BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE OUR FALL BACK BECAUSE WE HAVE INVESTED IN- TAKEN FULL ADVANTAGE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND- MAKING SURE THAT. STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TRAINED CAN TRANSITION FROM THOSE HISTORIC MANUAL TOUCH POSITIONS IN TWO OF THE USE OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY SO- I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR- COMMITMENT AND TIRELESS WORK- WE WILL ALL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER. TO MAKE SURE THE CAL WHEN YOU RESIDENTS HAVE THE SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE GOVERNMENT DESIGNED FOR- AND THAT IS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS SAYS DR PANTS SUGGEST. IT THAT WE ARE IN ALIGNMENT- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING. AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL IN THE APPROPRIATE THINGS TO MAKE- THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THE EFFICIENT- STATE AGENCY WE ALL NEED FOR IT TO BE. THANK YOU SO I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS ABLE TO RAISE MY HAND MISTER CHAIR BUT- IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND. YOU HAVE YOUR NEXT ON MY LIST SENATOR JACKSON RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU FIRST I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS AT EDDIE G. D. I KNOW- WE HAD- DURING OUR FIRES IN THE CRISIS HERE IN MY DISTRICT IN SANTA BARBARA VENTURA COUNTY. HE DD WAS THERE. TO HELP. AND THEY WERE. CLEARLY CARING THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL AND I KNOW THAT THAT IS SORT OF THE CULTURE OVER D. D. D. AND I SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. OF THAT BEING SAID WHEN WE'VE HAD THIS CRISIS- AND THAT HAS REALLY IMPACTED SO MANY CALIFORNIANS SO MANY AMERICANS- IT'S ONE THING TO BE WORKING. YOU KNOW TWELVE HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK BUT FOR THE RECIPIENTS WHO ARE GETTING THEIR BENEFITS I IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO SEE BEYOND THEIR OWN PERSONAL NEEDS- AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE SO- I DO WANT TO THANK YOU BUT BUT I AM CONCERNED AS EVERYONE HAS ARTICULATED- SO FAR. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE ALMOST- INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT IT IS TAKING SO LONG TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS- IT SEEMS AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY'RE REALLY KIND OF TWO. BASIC ISSUES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE SEEKING. THIS ASSISTANCE ARE THEY LEGITIMATE ARE LEGITIMATELY ENTITLED. SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO IS DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE AND THE NEXT IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THOSE BENEFITS- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER HAD A KIND OF COMPLEXITIES ARE BUT- IT SEEMS TO ME THOSE ARE THE TWO BASIC ISSUES. THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND- THE FACT THAT IT TAKES YEARS TO TRAIN PEOPLE APPROPRIATELY. SAYS TO ME AS A POLICYMAKER THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE IF THE SYSTEM IS SO DIFFICULT- NOT ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS SEEKING- THE ASSISTANCE ARE A MUST- INJURE BUT THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING IT SO- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR FIRST MY FIRST QUESTION. REALLY IS HAVE THE PROBLEM'S BEEN MORE RELATED TO THE LACK OF TECHNOLOGY. OR THE- THE LACK OF- OF TRAINING. IN A WORDS THAT THIS. ISSUE MANAGEMENT STAFFING OR OTHER NON I TEACH SHOES ARE REALLY IS THIS SOMETHING WHERE IF WE DIVED INTO THIS- AND THAT'S THE STATE THAT INVENTS ALL THE TECHNOLOGY BUT CERTAINLY HISTORICALLY HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO APPLY IT. AFFECTED LAKE. OR ECONOMICALLY- IF WE LOOK TO TRY TO AS AS SENATOR MITCHELL IS SUGGESTING REALLY- I HAD. A MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED AND EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGICAL- OVERLAY TO THE SYSTEM WOULD THAT MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK- TRULY EXPEDITIOUSLY- AND EFFECTIVELY FOR THAT THE CLIENTS THAT YOU HAVE. HI SENATOR THIS IS CAROL WILLIAMS- PERHAPS- DIRECTOR TOM CAN ASSIST WITH THIS AS WELL BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS. THE ENEFITS SYSTEM MODERNIZATION WAS REALLY I TRIED DOING. JUST THAT BECAUSE IT IT WILL CERTAINLY GET UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS OUR ABSOLUTE PRIMARY. WE CERTAINLY HAVE OTHER BENEFITS TO PAY OUT TO THE CLAIMANTS M. JUST MY SHORT TIME BEING THE LACK OF A FULLY ROBUST INTERPRET INTEGRATED CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS WHERE WE LOSE TIME. AND WHERE THERE IS- MULTIPLE LAYERS OF PROCESSES WHICH TAKE TIME TO GO THROUGH-AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T SEE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS. THESE CLAIMS HAVE SO MANY TOUCH POINTS THEY GO THROUGH SO MANY ITERATIONS BUT CERTAINLY UPDATED SMART INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY WE CAN SEE YOUR WAY. THROUGH THIS IN THE FUTURE. SO THAT'S WHY I DO LOOK TO AT THE RIGHT TIME IS THE- VENTURE MLB ALSO ADDRESSED BY THE STRIKING THANK YOU WHAT WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE WHAT WHAT IS THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IS THAT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE. AND WHY ARE WE NOT PURSUING IT IF IT IS. YEAH AND- I COULD JUMP I'D CHIME IN HERE- SENATOR JACKSON- SO IF I'M ON THE STRIKE TEAM ANALYSIS ACTUALLY IT'S A COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE- YOU KNOW FROM FROM FROM AGES AGO THAT LACKS THE FLEXIBILITY. TO ALIGN WITH THE MEDIA AT A BUSINESS CHANGE OR EVOLUTION THAT HAS BEEN REQUIRED IN RESPECT IN THE RAPID RESPONSE OF THE PANDEMIC THAT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE COST TO IT. BUT DISTRACTING REPORT HAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT IF THERE ARE OPERATIONAL M. POLICY PROCEDURE PROCESS CHALLENGES THAT THE THAT NEEDED TO BE STREAMLINED AND I THINK ONE OF THE- PREVIOUS- I MADE MAYBE WAS. A SENATOR MITCHELL MAYBE LISTEN TO RECOUNT THAT WAS ASKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH FRIDAY'S DON'T LET'S LET'S NOT GET TOO TIGHT YOU KNOW ON THE FRAUD THAT PREVENT THE GOOD YOU KNOW INTENDED CLAIMANTS ACTUALLY GO THROUGH AND THAT OF ITSELF. AND DISTRACTING REPORT HAS SUGGESTED AN EDT IS FOLLOWING SUIT ON THAT TOO LOOKING AT FOR THE POLICY AND PROCEDURE OPERATION ASPECT WHAT CAN BE DONE TO RIGHT SIZE THIS. SO AND THEN IN ADDITION ALL OF THAT THE M. AND THE MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY IN THE TRAINING THAT'S REQUIRED THAT PERHAPS THERE IS A LOT OF MANUAL PROCESS YOU KNOW HAVE YOU HEARD FROM CAROL THAT IS NEEDED. THAT IF THAT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AUTOMATION THAT NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW A STRONG FOCUS SO I WOULD SAY FROM THE STRIKING OBSERVATION AND THE STRIKING RECOMMENDATION IF THE HOLISTIC APPROACH FROM A TECH POLICY IMPROVEMENT THAT. NEEDED TO HAPPEN IN THE IN IN ET. SO IT WHEN YOU SAY A WHOLE LIST OF. YOU MENTION. IN THE ISSUE. THAT THERE WHAT WHAT ELSE IS INCLUDED. IN THAT HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT. REQUIRES WE LOOK. OUTSIDE OF A TECHNOLOGY IS THE PRIMARY. DRIVER INEFFICIENCY IN THIS PROCESS. I WENT OUT ON TOP OF THAT IT IS REALLY- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HUMAN CENTERED EXPERIENCE AND I BELIEVE IN THE RESERVE MENTIONED DAD AND THAT WAS YOU KNOW VERY MUCH IN LINE MAN WITH THE LABOR AGENCY ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH THAT WHEN DESIGNING THESE PROCESS AND OPERATION EFFICIENCY AND THEREFORE COUPLED BY THE TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE THAT. IT REALLY HAS TO COME FROM WHAT IS THE BEST EXPERIENCE THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO THESE CLAIMANT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF A DIGITAL INNOVATION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE V. D. AS EDT PURSUING THEIR NEW MODERNIZATION EFFORT WHICH IS CALLED THE BUSINESS BOUGHT BY A SYSTEM MODERNIZATION BSN. I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT FOCUS THAT'S AT THE FOREFRONT THE USER EXPERIENCE NEEDS TO DRIVE A LOT OF THESE MODERNIZATION SO IF I MAY WHEN IT COMES TO USER EXPERIENCE. I MEAN MOST THESE PEOPLE JUST WANT TO GET THOSE PAYCHECKS SO THAT THEY CAN PAY THEIR RENT PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO THIS- HUMAN EXPERIENCE. THAT IS SO CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON IN ADDITION TO THE TECHNOLOGY I MEAN CERTAINLY IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY ON THE PHONE TO ASSURE YOU THE MONEY'S COMING THAT YOUR SITUATION IS BEING HANDLED PROPERLY- BUT BEYOND THAT WHAT IS THERE ABOUT THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE THAT YOU FEEL. REQUIRES. ADDITIONAL I'M PLEASED AT THE- WORK. WHO WELL TRAINED- SO IN IN THIS OUR PARENTS WE SOPHISTICATED PROCESS. RIGHT AND I'M GONNA- ASK MY- A COLLEAGUE- WE DIET TO JUMP IN AS APPROPRIATE AS WELL AND ALSO AS WELL AS MORE EDT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE. A STRONG BELIEVER IN OF THIS AS WELL I CAN SPEAK TO ADAM REESE BUT THEY'RE VERY BRIEFLY SENATOR JACKSON DO YOU SEPARATE EXPRESS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT STARTED RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THE MENU TOUCHES REQUIRE AND I BELIEVE- JOHN FROM EARLY ADMISSION TO IS PERHAPS THE COMPLICATED INSTRUCTIONS ON FILING. APPLICATION AND IS PERHAPS THE ONLINE THESE TWO EASY FOR SOMEBODY TO TRANSPOSE THERE ARE YOU KNOW BIRTHDAY IN AUGUST NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. AND BECAUSE OF THOSE- YOU KNOW- A DIFFICULT TO USE OF APPLICATION OR DIFFICULTY IN THE INSTRUCTION THAT CREATED- MORE MENU TOUCH REQUIREMENTS. TOOL TO FILE A CLAIM AND THE USER EXPERIENCE ASPECT IS TO LOOK FOR IMPROVEMENT ON THAT. AND THEN ANOTHER THING I'LL HAND IT OFF TO- WE DIAL IS YOU GETTING RIGHT GETTING TO. COMMUNICATION IN KEEPING THE CLAIMANTS IN TERMS OF WHERE THE STATUS OF THE- CLAIM IS WILL GO A LONG WAY IN HELPING THE CLAIM AND TO- YOU KNOW LESS ANXIETY ABOUT WHERE THINGS ARE AT THE NEVER HEARD BACK OR NOT KNOWING HOW LONG. IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT ANOTHER USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENT BUT YOU GUYS WORKING WITH EDT TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO THE CLAIMANT ALONG. THIS PROCESS. I'M SORRY SO AS AN EX OF THAT I THINK WE YOU PUT AND ON AND TELL YOU. IT DAILY WE THE- IS. RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW NOT A MAJOR PROCESS. OR IS THIS THE KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT IS AVAILABLE OR WOULD BE AVAILABLE THE REASON I'M BRINGING THIS UP IS THAT. PART OF THE CHALLENGE AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE STATISTICS OF THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT SUDDENLY WELL I MEAN WE HAD THIS PANDEMIC AND SUDDENLY. YOUR WORKLOAD WAS EXTREME- AND YOU STILL AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS SAY LOOK LET'S. TAKE SOME OF THESE NEW HIRES- GIVE SOME MORE MENIAL TASK BECAUSE THE PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS WORK ARE SPENDING ALL THEIR TIME TRAINING AND NOT DOING WORK SO I'M TRYING TO THINK- IS THERE SOME WAY WE COULD BE MORE PREPARED IN THE FUTURE. GOD FOR BED BUGS. IT'S LIKELY WE'RE GOING TO SEE THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONS AGAIN. WHERE WE HAVE THE TOOLS AVAILABLE SO THAT- WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN OUT AND HIRE. THOUSANDS OF NEW PEOPLE THAT WE CAN'T TRAIN BECAUSE THE PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS HAVE TO DO THE WORK AND CAN'T SPEND THE TIME TRAINING PEOPLE WHO. FOR WHOM IT WILL TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET EDUCATED ANYWAY SO. THAT YOU ALWAYS HEAR IT. ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT ARE THESE THINGS THAT ARE REASONABLE TO PURSUE. YEAH AS A CENTER JACKSON A DIET BUT NIGHT FROM ODI ODD THAT HI YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE CAN MAKE BOTH ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL SIDE. THE NON TECHNOLOGICAL SIDE HI TO BOTH IMPROVE THE CURRENT EXPERIENCE GIVING THEM THE STATUS OF THE CLAIM AS YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS AT EVERY POINT ALONG THE WAY. NOT JUST THAT YOU HAVE CLEARED THE IDENTIFICATION VERIFICATION A STEP IN THE PROCESS BUT YOU'VE ALSO GONE IN CLEAR THE WAGE COMPUTATION PART OF THE PROCESS. THAT WE ARE WAITING ON A CERTIFICATION- DOCUMENTS FROM YOU ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PROCESS I THINK AND PROVIDING VISIBILITY INTO THEM. AT THIS POINT. THE LEVEL OF RESOLUTION OF THE UPDATES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE OFTEN SAY PENDING. AND THAT'S NOT REALLY HELPFUL TO PEOPLE AND SO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE PEOPLE JUST A LITTLE MORE GRANULAR DETAIL THAT SAYS. ARE YOU WAITING FOR ME TO TAKE ACTION AS A CALIFORNIA ARE YOU WAITING FOR EDT TO TAKE ACTION TO OPEN THE EMAIL THAT I SENT YOU WHERE ARE WE EXACTLY IN THE PROCESS. SO THAT I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO IS A CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AS AS THE CITY CALIFORNIA SO THAT IS CERTAINLY A PART OF IT- THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF IT AS WELL. AND IT'S EXACTLY TRUE APPOINTED BEING PREPARED FOR THE NEXT. TIME WHERE WE REALLY TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE INTO. OF WHAT PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE AND ADD ON. THAT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES AROUND DATA THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES ABOUT BEING READY TO GUIDE TO HAVE OUR SYSTEMS- BE UPDATED WITH THE LATEST DATA THAT WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT. SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE FUTURE THAT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT IT'S ALSO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF INVESTMENT AROUND. MAKING SURE THAT- THAT ALL THE DATA IS FLOWING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF EDTA. ARE THERE'S A THIRD PART TO IT AS WELL WHICH IS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY WAS RAISED- PRETTY STRONGLY I THINK FROM THE EDT FRONTLINE STAFF. EDT FRONTLINE STAFF ARE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN. HELPING CALIFORNIANS SOLVING THE ISSUES RESOLVING THE CLAIMS YOU'LL HEAR THE WORD AND YOU SAW IT PROBABLY IN THE STRIKING REPORT. THE WORDS WORK ITEMS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA THAT WE NEED THERE'S A LOT OF CHECKS THAT YOU DO DO YOU HAVE TO DO. TO BE ABLE TO- TO SIGN OFF THAT EIGHT THAT THE CLAIM IS COMPUTED RIGHTLY AND THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE MONEY THAT THEY DESERVE BECAUSE- ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT. SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY TO MAKE THOSE STEPS AROUND WAGE COMPUTATION. EASIER ON WAGE CALCULATIONS EASIER AND MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY GETS OUT THE DOOR FAST- THERE ARE SOME FEDERAL RULES THAT ARE IN PLACE- ABOUT HOW PEOPLE NEED TO CERTIFY- CITY CALIFORNIA. HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS TO TRY TO- ACCELERATE THAT AND TRY TO. UNDERSTAND HOW WE COULD HOW WE COULD THRIVE WITHIN THAT CONTEXT ESPECIALLY WITH THE POOL PROGRAM THAT WAS IN PLACE WHICH HAD DRAMATICALLY. FEWER RULES THAN NOT THAN THE U. I. SYSTEM SO YOU TALK ABOUT ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SYSTEM THAT CAN HELP. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN ADD THAT THAT THEY HAVE TO BE IN PLACE. WE'RE WE'RE REALLY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK OUT WITH EDTA BECAUSE BACK TO WHAT- WHAT DOES SENATOR MITCHELL TALKED ABOUT AS WELL WHICH IS. GOT POPS. AND SPECIFICALLY BOTH ODI AND CD T. ARE PART OF GULF POPS AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU NEED TO TRY TO SOLVE THESE KINDS OF ISSUES- AND TO REALLY ENVISION. WHAT THE MORE TRANSFORMATIVE ELEMENTS FOR THAT CLAIM AND EXPERIENCE COULD BE LIKE AND SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT. AS WELL AND- AND ALL OF THAT IS CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO REALLY REVOLUTIONIZE WHAT PEOPLE NEED BECAUSE- ULTIMATELY WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS THEY'RE HURTING THEY NEED THEIR MONEY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOW QUICKLY CAN WE GET IT TO THEM. HOW CAN WE BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHICH PARTS OF POLICIES AND FOR. WE CAN FLEX ON BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY VERY. DIFFICULT TIMES FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT OF COURSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BECAUSE WE WISH YOU ARE THE FACE OF GOVERNMENT FOR A LOT OF THESE THINGS. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY HAVE- TRUST. IN GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW IT'S BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE ON. EVERY LEVEL OF FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SAID WE WON'T GO INTO BUT- I. IN THAT LINE OF. THINKING AND QUESTIONING DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW OTHER STATES UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEMS FACED WITH THE- THE MASSIVE INCREASE IN CLAIMS BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC. I HAVE FARED IN COMPARISON TO OURS- HOW HOW THERE WAS A BACKLOG COMPARING TO A LARGE THE- AVERAGE TIME BETWEEN RECEIPT OF A CLAIM- AND PAYMENT OF A CLAIM AND- OTHER PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS THAT ARE BEING- WITHIN SOME STATED PERIOD OF TIME DIDN'T. HAVE YOU HAVE YOU LOOKED. AT THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA YOU CAN SHARE. HEY THIS IS MARIE'S SUMMER I CAN A LITTLE BIT WITH THEM WHEN THEY'RE THERE ARE THE GENERAL. DIFFICULT TO COMPARE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- YOU I CLAIMS THAT IN A WAY THAT ARE VERY. VOLATILE BUT THERE ARE SOME BASIC MEASURES THAT A COUPLE GROUPS TO PUT TOGETHER- THAT LOOK OUT LOOK AT THE PERCENT OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN PROCESSED BY STATES SINCE CORBETT. AND WE RANK I BELIEVE LAST TIME I LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS WERE UP AROUND FOURTEEN. SO WE'RE DOING PRETTY WELL RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES BUT OBVIOUSLY. THAT THAT'S NOT A GOD ENOUGH ANSWER YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO BETTER FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S WAITING ON THEIR BENEFITS BUT RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES WHEN IT COMES TO THAT BASIC MEASURE. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE DOING PRETTY WELL. SO HAVE WE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM THE ONES THAT ARE DOING BETTER THAN WE ARE ARE THERE ANY PROCESSES OR PROCEDURES OR APPROACHES THAT. WOULD BENEFIT US THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO REPLICATE SOME OF THEIR. SUCCESSES FOR CALIFORNIANS. I AM I DON'T I WOULD DEFER TO- RETIRED NAVY PROBABLY ON THAT ONE- I MEAN I CAN SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INFORMATION SURE THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION CALLED. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE WORK FORCE AGENCY WHICH IS BASICALLY. THE ESTIMATING GROUPS LOBBYING ORGANIZATION FROM THE STATE YOUR AGENCY'S WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND THERE'S A LOT OF SHARING OF INFORMATION HAPPENING THERE. ARE A DIFFERENT LEVELS AROUND THE PRIDE STAR AND ACCESS ISSUES- SO WE'RE WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THOSE EFFORTS- AND FOR SURE YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMMUNICATION AGAIN. IN A LOT OF NEW SO THE FOLKS- YOU KNOW. WE'RE NOT A FAN RIGHT NOW ARE NEW. IT'S MY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS. IMPORTANT COMMUNICATIONS LIKE AROUND THE ROLL OUT OF YOUR WAY. WITH OTHER STATES AS WELL SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT- AGAIN FROM THE LABOR AGENCY PERSPECTIVE WE'RE TRYING TO DO MORE OF THAT. AND YOU'RE INTERESTED IN COMPARING NOTES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH OTHER STATES. WELL I HOPE SO BECAUSE- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA WERE USUALLY LEADS THE WAY IN OTHER STATES IMPROVE UPON WHAT WE'VE DONE. IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IF WE COULD LEARN- PERHAPS WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THAT AT THAT HAVE BEEN. MORE EFFECTIVE- AND THEN APPLY THOSE TO THE EXTENT WE CAN CALIFORNIA COURSES. SO UNIQUE AND- WE HAVE SO MANY DIVERSE POPULATIONS OR WHAT HAVE YOU BUT- I HOPE THAT THAT- INQUIRY WILL CONTINUE SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO IMPROVE. UPON WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WITH THAT IN MIND- CAN ANYONE HERE TELL ME- GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE- FOR CASES. THAT ARE BEING PUT ON THE NEW ONLINE SYSTEM TO BE RESOLVED SO WE CAN. ASSURE OUR STAFF OUR DISTRICT STAFF THAT- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE- AND HAVE TO ENDURE A LOT OF THE SAME- DELAYS THAT WE HAVE SEEN AND OF COURSE. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE ABILITY TO HAVE DIRECT CONTACT THE WORKER I THINK IT'S BEEN A TRUE. PLUS I KNOW MY STAFF HAS EXPRESSED GREAT. AND HOW WOULD HELPED RESOLVE SOME OF OUR CLIENTS BUT- GOING FORWARD DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE ON THE LIKE THE TIME. SO I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A SERVICE CENTER THIS IS NANCY VARIOUS- WE ARE THAT THE NEW CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS GOING TO MAKE THINGS MUCH EASIER TO DEAL WITH THOSE CASES- WE ARE WORKING ON THE OLDEST CASES FIRST. AND SO WHILE SOME OF THEM MAY BE STILL COMPLEX I MEAN I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE AN ESTIMATE AS TO HOW LONG EACH CASE WOULD TAKE I THINK SOME. ARE CAN OBVIOUSLY BE WORKED ON- AND RESULTS FASTER THAN OTHERS- BUT WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WITH THE NEW CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND THE ORGANIZATION THAT THAT. PROVIDES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE- SOME OF THESE CASES. AND OF COURSE IF IT'S A HARDSHIP CASE YOU KNOW THOSE GET EXPEDITED. RIGHT AWAY SOURCES WE SEE THIS PANDEMIC IS CONTINUING AND- YOU KNOW THE MONEY IS RUNNING OUT THERE WILL BE I THINK OF THE UPS AND DOWNS WE'RE SEEING IT IN OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY'RE SEEING THE SECOND WAVE AND THINGS ARE CLOSING DOWN OF PEOPLE ARE AGAIN LOSING THEIR JOBS I. I ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING THIS AS I'M SURE YOU DO AND SO IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO GET. THIS GOING AND I KNOW I'M TERMED OUT SO- CENTER HILL AND I WILL BE WATCHING I'M SURE WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION BUT I KNOW THAT OUR COLLEAGUES. ARE VERY ANXIOUS TO BE HELPFUL TO ANY EXTENT THEY CAN BE AND I CERTAINLY- APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE. AGAIN COMMITTED TO THIS BUT I DON'T THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO GET BETTER THAT QUICKLY UNTIL WE HAVE A LEGITIMATE VACCINE UP MY ONE LAST QUESTION GOES INTO A- ANOTHER AREA- AND I WANT TO THANK GOD- THE REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT. WE ARE- BECAUSE A PAID FAMILY LEAVE ISSUES AND- THAT IS SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS PROGRAM RECENT LAWS ON FAMILY LEAVE ARE LIKELY GOING TO EXPAND OUR DEMAND FOR FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS- S. B. GOSH I CAN THINK OF THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW BUT CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF BILLS THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THAT COMES TO MIND IMMEDIATELY ON. EXPANDING PAID. FAMILY LEAVE AND- THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO HAVE PROTECTIONS FOR THAT WE EXPECT WE'LL SEE MORE PEOPLE ACCESSING IT THEN WE HAVE- A MILITARY EXIGENCY OF FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS WHICH TAKE EFFECT IN JANUARY- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR PREPARATION FOR THIS BECAUSE- THESE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO CALL UPON- YOU KNOW GREATER- PARTICIPATION. AND PROBABLY GREATER DEMAND HOW ARE YOU PLANNING FOR THOSE- PROGRAMS TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR CAROL WILLIAMS- SO FIRST LET ME ADDRESS THAT- THE COOK AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC THANKFULLY HAS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR PAID FAMILY LEAVE OR DISABILITY INSURANCE WORKLOADS BOTH. OF THOSE WORK LET'S CONTINUE TO MEET THE CURRENT METRIC GOALS BUT WE WORK- COHESIVELY AS A TEAM AND THEY ARE THE BEST LEADERSHIP TEAM AND THE EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY WORKING HAND IN HAND IN GOING THROUGH THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE EXPERIENCE THE TOOLS THAT THE STRIKE TEAM IS DELIVERED TO US. IT'S ONE OF THE NAMES CALLED BURN DOWN TILL IT'S HOW YOU TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR WORK AND FORECAST THESE ARE THE TOOLS WE HAVE ALREADY AND ARE INTRODUCING TO OUR OTHER PROGRAMS IN ANTICIPATION OF. UNKNOWN FOR SCENES WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WHEN HE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE SO THANKFULLY AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE STRAIGHT TEAM THOSE TOOLS THAT THEY DON'T. REAL BENEFIT THE REST OF THE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AT EDT AND THEY'RE- NOW LEARNING HOW TO USE THOSE TOOLS IN PREPARATION FOR- FOR SCENES ARE FORESEEN IN THE FUTURE IN THEIR FUTURE FOR THOSE BENEFIT PROGRAMS. AND WELL THANK YOU- THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK I THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR EFFORTS AND- IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE WILL. READ OR MAYBE FOR THE TIME THE ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESSING TECHNOLOGY- BUT DOING IT WITH A WITH A- STRONG MINDSET TOWARDS PRIVACY RIGHTS. BUT THERE IS TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO- PURSUE- TO EXPEDITE ALL OF THIS AND IT'S BEEN A VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS FOR THAT. TWENTY TWO YEARS THATI'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS- BUT IT'S MY HOPE THAT GOING FORWARD AT LEAST- WILL BE ABLE TO USE THOSE TECHNOLOGIES TO THE BENEFIT. OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON AND I KNOW SENATOR PAN HAD A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR HELLO. REFERENCE WAS MADE TO A- SO I CALLED BENEFIT SYSTEM MODERNIZATION OR WHAT'S THE SO- DO YOU SPEAK TO THE STATUS OF WHERE WE ARE WITH- I. T. SERVICE. DRESS MORE SPECIFICALLY ID IN ME BUT THE LARGER PICTURE IN TERMS OF THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE OVER AT EDM PARTICULARLY RELATED TO YOU I'D WHAT WHERE ARE WE WITH THAT. WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO START FIRST AND THEN I WILL CAN- ADD TO DIE FROM THE STATE'S OVERSIGHT ASPECT ABSOLUTELY THAT'S INTERESTING. AS A DRESS WITH STRIKING REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION WAS TO PUT BSM ON BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR MORE URGENT ISSUE WAS TO GET THE CAP GET THESE BACK WHAT CLAIMS PAID. SO THAT WAS EFFECTIVELY DONE THERE'D BE SOME PROJECT WAS PUT ON PAUSE BELIEVE- LATE MID SEPTEMBER THE FANTASTIC EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO THAT PROJECT HAVE ALL BEEN REDEPLOYED BACK TO WHERE THE ORIGINAL- OR NEAR THEIR ORIGINAL WORK ASSIGNMENTS WORK BECAUSE AGAIN THE FOCUS IS CURRENTLY ON THE BACKLOG AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND THIS IS. SURE WE READ MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE WILL REASSEMBLE AND LOOK AT HOW TO. ENGAGE IN THIS EFFORT- FOR TODAY'S TIME AND HOLISTICALLY WRAPPING AROUND THE OTHER BENEFITS OF THE DEPARTMENT THANK YOU. YES AND I UNDERSTAND THE STANDARD VAMPIRE I'M JUST OF THE BIGGER PICTURE SO WHERE- SO WHAT STAGE IS THE SAN AND- WHERE WHERE DO WE- WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR THAT. THE PROJECT. CENTER BUT I CAN SPEAK TO THAT FROM EIGHTY OVERSIGHT ASPECT SO THAT PROJECT- THE STATE YOU JUST YOU'RE MENTIONING- THE PROJECT ITSELF WAS GOING THROUGH THE FOUR STAGES OF THE PLAN- PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PAL. AND IT WAS AT STAGE THREE WHERE THAT THE- THERE WAS ACTUALLY A PROCUREMENT I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF- BEING NEGOTIATED AND THAT PROCUREMENT SELLS AFTER THE PANDEMIC AND THEY'RE ALSO PROPER TIME FRAME NEEDED TO PUT ON HOLD. PUT ON PAUSE AND A SUBSEQUENT TO THE PROCUREMENT POLICIES DIDN'T HIRE PROJECT WAS PUT ON PAUSE AS CAROL MENTIONED- BECAUSE THE FOCUS NEEDS TO SHIFT ALL RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG NEEDS FROM YOU I'VE HEARD ABOUT. MOVING FORWARD- THE A. D. AS SOON AS THE- BACKLOG IT'S REACH TO ATTAINABLE THAT YOU KNOW OF A SPACE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT GENERATES THAT TIME FRAME WE ARE AS AN OVERSIGHT INTO T. GONNA GOD ENGAGE WITH EDT ALONG WITH- OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION TO TAKE A LOOK. YOU KNOW THE PRIORITIZATION OF THE CURRENT BSM PROJECT- THE MEMBER OF THE B. AS IN PROJECTS COVERS PAID FAMILY LEAVE. DISABILITY INSURANCE AND YOU WHY INSURANCE THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS- TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TO SEE WHAT. A pPRIORITIZED THE MORE IMPORTANTLY BASED ON ALL THE LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. AT THE I. USERS A HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN LOOKING AT INTERACTIVE IMPROVEMENTS TO TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO SENATOR JACKSON'S POINT. AND RATHER THAN A BIG REPAIR REPLACE EFFORT AND LOOKING AT ALSO LEVERAGE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE MODERNIZATION OF FOR THAT IT'S ALREADY AND CONTINUED TO GO ON YOU KNOW IN RESPONSE TO AND THAT MAKE IT SPECIFIC TO YOUR WATCH. SEE HOW MUCH OF THOSE CAN BE LEVERAGED SO THAT IS NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL BUT THEY CONTINUE TO A SALARY THAT MODERNIZATION EFFORT. THROUGH THE RE ENGAGEMENT WITH EDT OBVIOUS THAT. IN IS THIS USING THE I. JOB SO. ABSOLUTELY IS LOOK FOR WAYS OF A CAN AND ENTERED A IN AS OPPOSED TO THE WAY FOR YOU KNOW THE END AT SOMETIME OF A WE PLAY EFFORT. MARKET I APPRECIATE NOTHING YOU SO MUCH FOR THE ANTS I ONE OF THE THINGS I DO WANT TO JUST CALM ON IS GENERALLY WE HAPPENS WE DO IT PROJECTS IN THE STATE- THE ONES AGO WELL. GO WELL AND- ARE THE LEAST DON'T HIT THE PRESS AND THE ONES THAT DON'T GET DEPRESSED SO THERE'S A GENERAL OPINION. R. SOMETIMES I THINK THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT- STATE IT PROJECTS- ARE ALWAYS A PROBLEMATIC. I WANT TO JUST COME INTO THAT- NOW WE HAVE GOOD ONCE AND WE'VE HAD BAD ONES AND I'VE CRITIQUE TO THE BAD ONES- BUT I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES SOMEONE WHOSE- CHAIRED TO TEARS MANY OTHER COMMITTEES AND DOES OVERSIGHT THAT WE'VE ALSO HAVE ONES ARE GOING YOU KNOW IT'S A RELATIVELY WELL I WON'T SAY THEY DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS. BUT THEY'RE GOING RELATIVELY WELL SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT- THE ROLE OF- OF PSYCHOLOGY AND DIRECTOR TOM OUT I'VE NOTICED THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN TERMS OF THE LEAST WHEN I'VE CONDUCTED OVERSIGHT OVER IT PROJECTS. AND APPRECIATE THE OVERSIGHT AND I THINK THAT- CERTAINLY ONE OF THE THINGS AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE PODS BECAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECT WE NEED TO ENGAGE THE WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES AND PARTICULARLY THE ONES WITH THE MOST EXPERIENCE AND SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. NOW IS THE TIME FOR THEM TO BE FOCUSING ON THINGS LIKE THE BACKLOG AND- BUT- UNTIL THEY ARE ABLE TO BE MORE FREEDOM SO WE CAN CAN DEVELOP THOSE. REALLY THAT HUMAN TECHNOLOGY INTERFACE- THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT BE ANY PROJECTS SUCCESSFUL- YEAH WE NEED TO ENGAGE THE PEOPLE ARE ON THE FRONT LINES SO- BUT I DO THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO- WHEN WE AS WE CAN CORPORATE LESSONS WE'RE LEARNING- TO CREATE THAT BACKBONE AND AGAIN TRYING TO COME OUT. IN APRIL YOU URGE. FOR EDIE AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE START DOING THE BUDGET PROCESS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT'S OUR BASELINE CAPACITY. SHOULD BE AND THAT'S- BOTH PEOPLE ENTER. AND THEN. BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO REALLY RE UP TO. IN CRISIS I THINK THAT'S WHY OF THINGS WE- COPING OVERALL. IS THAT. WHEN THE CRISIS HITS. THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SCRAMBLE AND I'LL TELL YOU AS A PHYSICIAN YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT SURGE CAPACITY AND SOMETIMES WE TALK ABOUT EFFICIENCY. AND WILL RESULT IN SOME WAYS WE TALK ABOUT FISSION SEE W DON'T THINK ABOUT SURGE CAPACITY RIGHT SO WE DON'T WANT. PEOPLE SORT OF VIOLENCE A SITTING AROUND ABOUT SITTING AROUND BUT- SAYING LIKE OH WELL LOOK WE HAVE SOME EXCESS CAPACITY. WELL THEN THE PROBLEM IS YOU DON'T IT'S NOT THERE DURING A SURGE. AND WE'RE REALLY IN TROUBLE AND WE LEARNED THAT WE SAW THAT WITH TV WE SAW TAT WITH OTHER TYPES OF SUPPLIES WERE SEEN THAT WITH- YOU I AND PEOPLE GET HURT WHEN THAT HAPPENS. SO I HOPE THAT DOES YOU KNOW SAID WE HAVE THE Q. PROBLEM WE'RE DEALING WITH BUT ALSO THAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR LONG TERM. AND THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT SO AGAIN I THANK YOU SO MUCH- THAT. FOR YOUR INDULGENCE WILL BE WORSE THAN US THANK YOU SENATOR PAN AND I DON'T KNOW IF MR PANIC- WANTED. TO COMMENT ON THAT QUESTION ALSO. A LAB DIE AND- ECHO. WHAT ARE PART AND SEE T. S. IN INDEED D. THAT. THIS OF. IS IT IS. DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT IS SENATOR JACKSON. ABOUT CALIFORNIA CAN LEGION- WE HAVE NOT NLY BEEN HISTORY EVEN IF SHE SHOULD WE HAVE US REAL HISTORY AND- TECHNOLOGY- AND YES PEOPLE ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE CALIFORNIANS ARE AT THE CENTER. OF THAT WHAT DO THEY NEED TO HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE. THAT IS NOT JUST FOR THE CALIFORNIANS I THINK THAT WE TYPICALLY. LOOK AT AS BEING THE QUOTE UNQUOTE. MAINSTREAM IT ALSO INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNDERPRIVILEGED THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED. AND THE CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED MORE JUST TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE KINDS OF SERVICES. THAT ARE THAT WAY. WE NEED THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS. SO THERE'S A PART OF THAT WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE TO BRING- THE LENS OF EQUITY. WE HAVE TO BRING THE LANDS OF UNDERSTANDING AND HOW DO WE INTEGRATE THAT INTO OUR- TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. SO THAT THEY CAN BE ACCESSED BY EVERYBODY BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY SERVE THEM BETTER- THERE'S ALSO A BIG PART OF IT AND SECRETARY- ADDRESS THIS AS- DID DIRECTOR TOM JUST NOW. WHICH IS THAT AT BAT THE EFFORT OF MODERNIZATION. AND THE EFFORT TO TRY TO GET OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. HOW TO BE ABLE TO BE FLEXIBLE TO BE ADAPTABLE TO BE RESILIENT. REQUIRES THAT WE START LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY HAVE NOT BEEN. CONSIDERED BEFORE HI AND WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY WITH THE CHANCE WE THINK ABOUT PROCUREMENT THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT SCOPING PROBLEMS. AND EVEN D. THE- PROJECTS THAT WE END UP CHARTERING SO THAT THEY ARE VERY FOCUSED ON THE RIGHT PROBLEMS- THAT CENTER JACKSON. TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER THAT- THAT THERE ARE OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT IDEA OF SPECIFIC. SERVICES THAT WE CAN PEEL OFF. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE CONFIRMATION THAT'S THAT WE WERE ON THE TRACK WE STRIKE. AROUND I DO ME STAY LIKE FLOOR IMPLY. I MEET SAY THIS IS ISSUE AND WE THINK THAT THIS CAN HELP ADDRESS THIS THE SOCIAL. ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTING ID ME BECAUSE IT WAS A GREAT TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BE USEFUL THE VA IMPLEMENTING ID ME BECAUSE IT'S A TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BE USEFUL SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT BOTH FROM STANDPOINT OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE BUT HOW WE CAN REALLY SOLVE AND ADDRESSED BOTH CALIFORNIANS NEEDS AS WELL AS MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE AS A POINTER. THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK A- PROFESSOR WITH THE RELATED TO THE STRIKE TEAM AND- DR TONG. HOW DOES IT MEET ID ME WORK DO. DO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO EDIE'S- SYSTEMS AT ALL IN THE PROCESS NO IT DOESN'T I DO ME IS A THINK OF IT IT'S A- A FRIEND AND- JUST A STAND ALONE IN. OUR SYSTEM- FOR THE PURPOSES OF- VALIDATING INDIVIDUALS IDENTITY ONLY AND IT DOES NOT HAVE INFORMATION- TO THE E. B. U. Y. SYSTEM FOR THE REST OF THE CLAIMED- INFORMATION- SO I COULD GO INTO A LITTLE BIT OF A- HOW THAT. PROCESS WORKS OR EVEN IF THAT WAS SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS YOUR THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS WHAT- WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DETERMINE WHEN THEY DO THEIR VERIFICATION THAT THEY FIND THAT THERE'S- THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER DOESN'T MATCH THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON THAT'S THERE THAT'S TRYING TO. MAKE THIS WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT- INTO THE SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH ANYONE OUTSIDE OF V. D. D. E. N. WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THAT INFORMATION TO THE SHERATON WITHEDT AND WHAT ACTION IS TAKEN AFTER THAT. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT- SENATOR HILL SO I MEAN THINK OF IT IT'S REALLY A STEP THAT HAS STAYED THERE THERE IS A SEPARATION OF WHAT INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE CHECKING AGAINST- SO BASICALLY AS A AS AN INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW BRING YOUR CLAIM AND IF YOU WANT IN THIS CASE- THE VERY FIRST FIRST UP THEY WILL GO TO THE EDT JUST SAY HEY I'D LIKE TO START APPLICATION. AND FROM THERE IT ACTUALLY TAKES DOWN TO A OF INDEPENDENCE SIDE IF YOU WHAT IS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH WAS BRANDED WITH EDT IT'S ACTUALLY THE ID ME PROCESS. IN CREATING A LOCKING ACCOUNT- CITY CAN COME BACK TO IT IF THEY DON'T FINISH THE IDENTITY VERIFICATION PROCESS BUT ALTHOUGH THE IDENTIFIER IDENTITY VERIFICATION PROCESS SUCH AS- YOU KNOW TAKING A PICTURE OF YOUR YOUR YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE TO BE UPLOADED OR ANSWERING SOME PRESET QUESTION TO IDENTIFY. YOU WALK WHEN YOU AREN'T TO VERIFY YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE IT'S ALL BEING DONE IN THE ID ME. SYSTEM AND THAT IT'S STAND SERVICE AS I HAVE POINTED. THAT IT'S USED BY. OTHER STAY ENTITY AS WELL THE FEDERAL. AND IS WHAT WE CALL A STANDARD SERVER OR INTO. TERM SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE. AND THE POOR THE END OF. TIED TO NOT PASS. THE VERIFICATION PROCESS. THAT INFORMATION READ WITH ME AND EDT ACCESS TO A YOU THEY CHOOSE TO. AND THAT INFORMATION DOES NOT GO FURTHER INTO THE EIGHTIES YOU HI ONLINE SYSTEM WHICH IS WHAT THE CLAIM I WOULD COME BACK TO YOU AND CONTINUED TO FINISH THEIR CLAIM PROCESS- AND WHAT TYPICALLY THAT WOULD DO- WITH THE INDIVIDUALS THAT DID NOT PASS THE ID VERIFICATION. ORDER RETAINED IS ONLY THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE PROVIDED IT'S JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO I AM. AND THAT INFORMATION IS NOT TO- I SHARED WITH ANYONE ELSE AND IF HE DID HE WANTS TO COME BACK TO THAT INFORMATION TO SAY HEY I WANT TO DO A MATCH TO SEE POTENTIALLY. HOW MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT PASSING BECAUSE THEY WERE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMANTS AND THAT WOULD ALLOW OR EVEN ABLE EASY TO DO THAT FURTHER PRICE INVESTIGATION. BY FROM AT THE CURRENT MOMENT THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DD IS ACCESSING BUT I JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT- IN OTHER STATES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY- YOU KNOW WHAT HAVE ACCESS TO IT IT FOR THEIR OWN SPECIFIC DATA. ROUND IF THAT NEEDS TO BE I SEE IN WHICH YOU INDICATED EARLIER THAT 30% OR 70% IS THE HERO OF SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED THROUGH THE PROCESS. SO THAT LEAVES OF ISSUE 30% THAT MAY BE AND I THINK THE COMMENT WAS THAT THOSE COULD BE OR COULD BE YOU'RE PROBABLY ARE FRAUDULENT- AND IF THAT'S THE. CASE AND- THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T VERIFY THERE FOR THIS IS I GUESS. FOR THE PURPOSE AND THEY GO IN THEY HAVE IT OR TRY TO. LOOK FOR AND SOME OTHER WAY BUT IF THAT'S 30% FRAUD. THE HOW DOES THAT IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT TO THE END TO THE- PROCESSES UP TO OCTOBER FIFTH WHEN. I ID NEEDS STARTED- DO HAVE WE ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT OF FRAUD THAT COULD HAVE BEEN. IN THE SYSTEM SINCE THAT TIME AND I DON'T MEAN THAT TO SAY THAT I JUST. LIVE BY LIVE IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO. YEAH I HAVE AN ID I DON'T LIVE IN SACRAMENTO BUT I HAVE A PLACE IN SACRAMENTO HOME IN SACRAMENTO AND I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE IN A MONTH AND I WENT AND I. JUST RECEIVED- I HAVE PROBABLY A DOZEN LETTERS. FROM ET DE COLD ADDRESSED TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE- THAT LAST I CHECKED THE LIVE IN MY HOUSE SO- THESE SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM I WILL GET THEM TO EAT HE DEVOTED I DON'T THIS IS THE INDICATION THIS IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE STATE. BUT IT HAS THERE BEEN AN ESTIMATE AND I KNOW THAT QUESTION WAS ASKED LAST WEEK IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. AN ESTIMATION AS TO HOW MUCH FRAUD THERE IS ENOUGH WORK ARE WE CONSIDERING 30% OF THOSE APPLICANTS- WERE FRAUDULENT BEFORE SO I. PROBABLY HAVE THE BACK TO EDT US BUT- ADDRESSED HOW MUCH PERSON WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF CURRENT CLAIMANT. OF CLEARING CURRENT FLAME SORRY IN THE SYSTEM THAT MIGHT BE A TRIBUTE TO FRAUD- BUT ON THE NEW CLAIMS ARE COMING IN SINCE. THE ID ME WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED I WOULD NOT GO AS FAR AS THEY ALL THERE ARE- CLOSE TO I BELIEVE LAST TIME WE CHECKED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND. INDIVIDUAL THAT 30% OF CALL AND SAY HEY ARE THERE OTHER WAYS SO THERE ARE. LEGITIMATE CLAIM AND I JUST NEED EXTRA HELP TO GET THROUGH- I THINK THE LATEST ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IS PROBABLY AROUND 18220% OFF SO. THAT OUR FULL STOP NEVER FOLLOW UP. THAT JUST NEVER FINISH THE PROCESS SO THOSE ARE GOOD INDICATORS. ALTHOUGH NOT DEFINITIVE THOSE AREN'T GOOD INDICATORS ARE FRAUDULENT IN. ANY OF THAT HAS ANY CORRELATION. OF THE NUMBERS OF ATTEMPTS. FOR PEOPLE TO TRY TO GET IN AND THE STOP OF THE- DOOR IF THAT'S- COURT. TO MANY. FRAUDULENT TO HAVE A MADE IT THROUGH THE SYSTEM PRIOR TO ON A TEAMMATE. THAT WOULD REQUIRE. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION- TO BE DONE BY EDT TO A PROVIDER NUMBER. OKAY ANALYSTS THAT WHEN IT WHEN I GET TO I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS REDUCE ALL ASK THEM WHEN WE GET TO BECAUSE I DID WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH. WITH YOU MISS DIRECTOR TOM. A LITTLE MORE. ON THAT- IT MAINLY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 18220% OF THOSE DOLLARS IN THAT FRAUD. YOU KNOW WHAT HOW WHY THAT'S SO IMPORTANT AS THOSE ARE DOLLARS THAT COULD BE USED AT SOME POINT FOR THOSE BENEFITS THAT THE- THOSE THAT REALLY NEED IT AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE FOR THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING SO MUCH. I GUESS TREE HOUSE HOW IS THE WORKING WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO IMPLEMENT THOSE I. T. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE OUTLINED IN THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT ARE THEY WORKING. CLOSELY NOW AND. IS THAT AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP YES I WOULD I WAS SAY THAT WITH INNING GAME. OF THE STRIKE TEAM THE RELATIONS IS TO THE DEGREE THAT BE. THERE DEFINITELY VERY SPECIFIC RECOMMEND. FOR AND THEN A ROADMAP FOR EACH FOLLOW. AND JUST AS OUR STANDARD OVER. ROLE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NOT ONLY GOT. CONTINUE WITHOUT INVOLVEMENT BUT WITH THE ADDITIONAL I'M CALLING FROM- ALREADY I. AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THE RECOMMENDATION FROM DISTRACTING REPORTS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT- WE ARE LITERALLY IN INTERACTION. ALMOST DAILY BASIS AND BE AVAILABLE AND TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF EDT IF THERE'S QUESTIONS OR CHALLENGES ARE BLOCKERS THAT THEY CAME IN. WERE THERE. TO HELP THEM TO MOVE THINGS ALONG. IF YOU THINK YOU YOU KNOW BACKLOG WORLD DEALING WITH IN. TO EAT D. THE CREW THIS FOR. WITH ID MEET. SICK TO MY AGO HAD THAT WITH ME A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE IN THAT BACKLOG TODAY AND- AND IN THE CLAIMS AND CERTAINLY IN THE VERIFICATION ON THE FOR THE FOR PERHAPS THE- REDUCTION OF THE FRAUD I KNOW THIS QUESTION CAME UP BEFORE AND I WOULD SAY DIED- BASED ON AND THEY APPROACH- PERHAPS DIED. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY SAY HEY WOULD HAVE THIS IMPLEMENT EARLIER WITHOUT MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE WHAT I CAN RESPOND TO- SENATOR HILL IS THE FACT THAT. THIS WAS VERY MUCH THIS RECOMMENDATION FIRST OF ALL TO DO IT IDENTITY VERIFICATION AUTOMATION IS VERY MUCH BASED ON THE- US TEAMS ASSESS. AND THERE WAS GOOD DATA- AND FROM YOU KNOW OBSERVATION IN TALKING TO YOU KNOW A GOOD EDT STAFFER IN THEIR EXPERIENCE IN PROCESSING CLAIMS AND LOOKING AT WHERE THE BIGGEST BOTTLENECK IS. AND IT WAS THROUGH THAT DATA IT WAS VALIDATED BUT THE BIGGEST BOTTLENECK AT THE VERY VERY FIRST IF THAT ENTITY VERIFICATION AND BECAUSE OF THAT. THE AUTOMATION WAS RECOMMENDED. OKAY IT I GUESS IN IN THE REALLY THE LAST QUESTION I GUESS THE PART DO YOU SEE THIS IN IN WA IN A YEAR FROM NOW. HOW DO YOU EXPECT EDT OR WHERE WOULD YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE RELATED TO. VERIFICATIONS IT RELATED TO ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT THE STRIKE TEAM WAS. LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT A SPECIALLY RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO AND- YOU KNOW WERE WERE VERY MUCH CONTINUED DOWN THE ROLE OF- HELPING THE DEPARTMENT THE CHANCE FORM FOR MULTIPLE LEVEL RIGHT TECHNOLOGY BEING ONE ASPECT OF IT BUT THE BUTTHE POLICY THE OPERATION THE PROCEDURE SIDE OF IT ALSO NEED TO BE. REVISITED THE STRIKING REPORTER HAVE STRIKE THAT BALANCE OF RECOGNIZING THE MODERNIZATION IS NOT PURELY IN TECHNOLOGY AND THEREFORE. A VERY SLOW SYNC A ROADMAP. FOR EASTER FOLLOW IN TERM OF LOOKING THERE AT WEIGHTS OF A TRANSFORMATION. AND LOOKING A YEAR DOWN THE ROLE- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. AND NOW WITH THE ADDITION OF OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION WOULD HELP WITH THAT TYPE OF HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN. AND WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL AND THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO- TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU D. D. IT'S ON A PATH OF SUCCESS. GOOD YOU. IN OUR TO GO TO THE PANEL JUST QUESTION FOR THE EMPLOYER PANEL THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS- AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMITMENT AND THE DEDICATION AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND IT'S LIKE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. INDICATED THAT THE DISTRICT OFFICES THAT WE ALL HAVE IN THIS DESTRUCTIVE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR STAFF MEMBERS HAVE HAD DEALING WITH THE CONSTITUENTS IN THE PAIN THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND THE SUFFERING. WE JUST CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS FOR YOU. AND FOR THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT- WORKING WITH. WITH THOSE CONSTITUENTS IN THOSE- THOSE APPLICANTS WHO ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND- IS DO YOU FEEL. DO YOU FEEL AS IF- EDT MANAGEMENT LISTENS TO. TO WHAT THE WORKERS REPORT AND IMPLEMENTS REFORMS TO MAKE YOUR JOB EASIER ARE THEY LISTENING AND MAKING THE CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO FIND THAT TO BE THE CASE. ANYONE CAN AT ANY TIME WELL THIS IS I MEAN GREEN. I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY TAKE A STAB AT THAT YES- MOST PART MANAGEMENT IS LISTENING AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR NEEDS ARE BEING MET- THAT THEY ARE TAKING EVERY- ASPECT IN EVERY STATEMENT THAT WE MAKE INTO CONSIDERATION- IT IS EVIDENT AND WHAT- THIS TOM JUST MENTIONED IS THAT THE STRIKE TEAM TOOK MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE- AND USE THEM TO CONSIDER THEY ARE- ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS. AND SO YES WE ARE BEING LISTENED TO ME ARE BEING HEARD- WE ARE BEING VALUED I. HOPE AND- WE CAN TO BE. IN THIS PROCESS R. D. IT INTO TO LAST IF YOU WILL AS WE MOVE ON IT COULD WITH THIS NATION IN YOU KNOW GETTING NOT ONLY J. THE IMMEDIATE ASPECT OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO GET TO THIS GOD AND- YOU'RE ASKING ME. ARE POPPING A PROCEDURE AND I JUST. MORE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THAT PROCESS AS THEY DID WHEN WE WERE MEETING WITH THE. STRIKE TEAM. THANK YOU WISH ME ANY OTHER. COMMENTS ON THAT FROM. MISS WILLOW. BEFORE WELL TO A TAKE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE CHERRY VERY HELPFUL AND ALL ONE OF THE THINGS TEAM REPORT SHE THE DVDS HAVE DIFFICULT ACCESSING TRANSFER SIR FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING CLAIMANTS IS THAT SHE HAS THAT BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE. AND WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IF HE COULD DO TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO TRANSLATION SERVICES. SPEAKING FROM MY EXPERIENCE DDD HAS PROVIDED A TRANSLATION SERVICE BUT WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO IF WE DO NEED TO PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL SERVICE TO THE CITIZENS WERE SERVING CALIFORNIA- WE DO UTILIZE THAT I MYSELF HAVE UTILIZED IT IT'S A VERY GOOD PROCESS- AND I'M ABLE TO SET UP A CONVERSATION WITH THE CLAIMS THAT I AM SORRY ABLE TO PROVIDE RESULTS IN- RESOLVE THEIR ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT- BACK TO WORK. CALIFORNIA AND THE D. D. THAT ALSO PROVIDE- LANGUAGE FROM ASSISTANCE AND THEY DO THAT OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEART AND ALSO ADDED THE ABILITY TO HELP SERVE OUR CALIFORNIANS SO YES WE ARE ACTUALLY- MEETING THAT CRITERIA MEANING THAT- ESTABLISHMENT IN ORDER TO GET TAKEN SEVERAL LANGUAGES- ANSWERED- COULD BE DOING MORE OF COURSE I MEAN AS AS WE KNOW THE CANDIDATE HAS HIGHLIGHTED. A NUMBER OF THINGS- THAT EDT CAN IMPROVE ON THIS IS. MOST LIKELY ONE OF THE- THANK YOU MISS. THIS IS GOING ON OKAY JUST WANTED TO WE HAVE BY LEE STUFF. HELLO AND SO OFTEN TIMES WHEN COME THANK BE TO MY- STUFF. IN THE PARTICULAR THE DAY COULD THE CLAIMANT HAS REACHED I'M IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVE TRY. NOW CANTONESE SPAN. AND TAGALOG FOR X. THANK YOU. TWO ONE. TWO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU SEE THAT THE UNITY KERR DO ROOM THE AT ALL I MAY HAVE THE- ARE ARE THE GETS A THE MICHIGAN THAT THE NOT. ERIC OR WE NEED TO. IT BE FRESH. FOR THE CLAIM IS IN THEY- DON'T MOVE WITH FOR SURE THEIR CLAIM BECAUSE OF THAT IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THAT. I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF LIKE WE GET A LOT OF CHINESE KOLS. TO OUR SWITCHBOARD AND WE DO THE BEST WE CAN- THERE'S A PROTOCOL FOR IF. SOMEONE IS INTERPRETING FOR A CLIENT WHO'S WITH THE CLAIMANT WE HAVE TO DO A CERTAIN AMOUNT UNTIL LIKE CARBONATED UNIFICATION KEPT VERBAL APPROVAL. BUT I'D SAY. THE VOLUME OF CALLS AT LEAST IN THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE AT THE SWITCHBOARD WE GET EXCEEDS OUR CAPACITY CONSIDERABLY SO IT'S A GOOD THING THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL SERVICE- THE WE NOW HAVE CONTRACTED TO DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE CAPACITY THE BILINGUAL CAPACITY NEEDED ON THE STOVE JUST FROM THIS VERY SORT OF. LOCALIZED OFFICE EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU IT IS ONE FOUR QUESTION FOR ART. GREAT USUAL THIS IT'LL BE ON A RE. ARE THERE ANY CHANGES OR REFORMS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE- IMPLEMENTED E. D. D. THAT'S NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE OPPORTUNITY THIS IS GREEN AGAIN TO SAY THAT THERE ARE PERSONALLY AND NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT ON A STEWARD FOR SEIU I AM ONE OF THEIR FRONT LINE PEOPLE THEY GET TO HEAR COMMENTS AND CONCERNS FROM FELLOW COWORKERS- SEEING AS THIS IS AN OPEN- I WOULD LIKE TO. EXTEND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT YES- ANY OF THE PANEL WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH ME PERSONALLY ABOUT WHAT THOSE ARE I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE THAT ONE ON ONE CONVERSATION- BUT GOING BACK TO THE JOB AS A WHOLE WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING IS GOING TO HELP TREMENDOUSLY- WITH OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE- THEN CLEAN. WE ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING SERVICE TO- AND SO IF WE CONTINUE ON THIS PATH THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH- THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE STRIKE TEAM HAS PUT IN PLACE AND WILL BE ON HAND- I BELIEVE THAT OUR JOBS WILL CONTINUE TO NOT ONLY BE- MORE SUCCESSFUL AT PROVIDING THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE NEED BUT ALSO BE MORE- I GUESS BENEFICIAL HARMONY FOR US IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SUCCEEDING IN.
