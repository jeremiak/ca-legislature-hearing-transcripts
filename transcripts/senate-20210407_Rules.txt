THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. TODAY I'M JOINED BY MY WIFE BRIDGET BREEN AND OUR DAUGHTERS LILY MORAINE AND ISABELLA LUNA. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY DANA POINTED DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA STATE PARK SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST HONORS IN MY LIFE. MY PASSIONS FOR NATURE PARKS AND WILDLIFE FOR LIFELONG INTEREST THAT HAVE GUIDED MY CAREER. I'VE SERVED AS U. S. NATIONAL PARK RANGER AND I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED. I ALSO SERVED AS A AN ELECTED WATER DISTRICT DIRECTOR AND AS AN APPOINTEE ON THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION. THEY BELIEVE THE DIVERSITY OF THESE EXPRIENCES ARE HELPING TO INFORM ME AS I LEAVE THE DEPARTMENT FORWARD. SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES AND SOLUTIONS FOR PARKS AND FOR PEOPLE. AS THE DIRECTOR OF THIS GREAT STATE PARK SYSTEM. IN THIS TIME OF COLLUDED DEVASTATING WILDFIRES AND SOCIAL UNREST. PARKS BECAME REFUGE IN PLACES OF RELAXATION AND RESPITE FOR THE PUBLIC. THIS IS SO SHOWN US CLEARLY THAT PARKS FOR THE PUBLIC ARE ESSENTIAL LANDSCAPES AND THE CENTRAL WATER SCAPES. AND STATE PARKS WE KNOW WE MUST BRING THE BEST OF OURSELVES FORWARD AND TOGETHER WITH THE PUBLIC AND ALL OF OUR PART PARTNERS. WE NEED TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON THE CRITICAL PRIORITIES FOR PARKS AND FOR PEOPLE. AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION I WILL ENSURE THAT OUR ACTIONS INCLUDE IMPLEMENTING MANAGEMENT PLANNING AND DESIGN. TO MAKE PARKS MORE SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT WELL INTO THE FUTURE. OUR ACTIONS AND DECISIONS WILL INCLUDE CLIMATE CHANGE PLANNING AN ADAPTATION. WE WILL APPLY JUSTICE EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN ALL ASPECTS OF PARK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS AND DECISION MAKING. WE WILL MEET THE DEMAND FOR PARKS FOR ALL BY PURSUING NEW PARKLAND ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTING GRANTS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. I BELIEVE THAT DEVELOPING STRONG PARK LEADERS AND TEAMS FOR THIS ENTRY IS AN IMPERATIVE FOR OUR SUCCESS OVERALL INCLUSIVE OF THESE ABOVE THESE GOALS PARKS WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT PARKS ORGANIZATION AND THIS PATH FORWARD IS REFLECTED IN OUR FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN. WHICH WE WILL BE PUBLISHING LATER THIS YEAR. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EMPLOYEES STAKEHOLDERS PARTNERS THE PUBLIC AND ELECTED LEADERS TO REFINE AND IMPLEMENT THE HIGHEST STANDARDS AS WE SHAPE CALIFORNIA STATE PARK SYSTEM. FOR A HEALTHY FUTURE FUTURE WELL INTO THIS CENTURY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS PRIVILEGE TO MEET WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START WITH SENATOR LAYERED GO AHEAD SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER. THEN A MR DIRECTOR THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND FOR YOUR SERVICE AND THANK YOU FOR THE MEETING THAT- WE HAD- YESTERDAY IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL. AND I KNOW WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER. IN YOUR PRIOR INCARNATIONS AS WATER COMMISSIONER WATER DIRECTOR AND EVEN AT UC MERCED. UP I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND I'LL TRY TO STEP THROUGH THEM A RELATIVELY QUICKLY INTO FIRST TWO IRONICALLY ARE ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE. IN MY SENATE DISTRICT BUT THERE STATEWIDE ISSUES AND THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THE- THE COASTAL COMMISSION RECENTLY TOOK INACTION WITH REGARD TO OCEANIC DUNES A STATE PARK AND THE OFF ROAD VEHICLE. AND I WAS GONNA ASK- JUST FIRST BROTHER DIRECTLY WHETHER STATE PARKS INTENDS TO COMPLY WITH THE- DIRECTION OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION THAT CAME OUT OF THAT HERE. SENATOR LAYERED IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. THE NEW CONDITIONS REYES COMPLEX ISSUE REGARDING THE OPERATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF OCEANIA JONES ALL OF WHICH STATE PARKS NEEDS TO CONSIDER. I AM WORKING WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST HELP LOWER IT MIGHT THESE NEW CONDITIONS. THE COMMISSION EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP UNDERSTANDS THE BEES ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MAKE IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE FULLY CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THESE DECISIONS AND HOW BEST TO OPERATIONALIZE THEM. IS RESPECT TO OUR RESOURCES PROTECTION PROJECTS OPERATIONS PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC ACCESS AS WE PROCEED. THE COMMISSION EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP AGREES THAT THE CONDITIONS NEED TO BE BETTER DEFINED IN LIGHT OF THINGS LIKE THE SHOREBIRD CONSERVATION PROGRAMS LAST MEDICATION PROGRAMS AND PUBLIC ACCESS WHICH WE NEED TO CONTINUE AND THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN JUST ALWAYS BE AXLES. AND MAYBE TO PUT A FINER. POINT ON IT- DOES THAT BECAUSE THE SAN LUIS OBISPO PAPERS ALREADY SAID THERE SOME. OUR THAT THEY DIRECTED THAT ARE NOT BEING COMPLIED WITH DO I ASSUME THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION STAFF. THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN YOU PERMISSION TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IN THERE. BUT THEIR DIRECTION AT THIS POINT HAVE THE- NO THEY HAVEN'T- WHAT I MEAN I CAN GIVE YOU A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE ARROYO GRANDE CREEK CROSSING- IS A REALLY COMPLEX OPERATIONAL ISSUE AMONG WHICH THEY PUT FORWARD. BY DIRECTED AND IT IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY WAY TO GAIN ACCESS INTO THE OCEANIA REGIONS SBRA AND THE COMMISSION STAFF EXECUTIVE STEP OF GREASE THAT THIS CONDITION NEEDS TO BE BETTER DEFINED. IN LIGHT OF SHOREBIRD CONSERVATION PROGRAMS AND DUST MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND THE PUBLIC ACCESS FOR CAMPING OF THAT WE STILL WANT TO CONTINUE AND ALSO DETERMINATION ALWAYS BE IS THREE YEARS OUT IN TERMS OVER SUPPOSED TO END UP BUT RIGHT NOW- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE HOW WE CAN EVEN ACCESS THE AREA GIVEN THE- DIRECTIVE. AND I'M SORRY I'M SORRY IT TOOK JUST KEEP PUTTING UP A FINER POINT ON IT. IF THEY'RE SAYING IT NEEDS TO BE BETTER DEFINED TO SET MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO COMPLY. WITH THAT UNTIL THEY BETTER DEFINE IT. WE'RE WORKING TO DEFINING THEM I AM MEETING WITH THE EXACT TO. WEEKLY AND WE'VE ALSO HAD OUR STAFF WORKING ON THE OPERATIONAL PLANS SO THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF. PUBLIC SAFETY RESOURCES PROTECTION AND REALLY KEEPING IN MIND THE MISSION OF THE STATE PARK SYSTEM WHICH WE NEED TO BE APPLIED AS WE GO FORWARD. ARM IN ANOTHER RELATED QUESTION THERE APPEARS TO BE OF LEGAL ACTION THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN AGAINST THE COASTAL COMMISSION ON THIS ARE YOU. WHAT'S YOUR POSITION ON STATE PARKS BEING INVOLVED IN ANY LEGAL ACTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT CRITICAL QUESTION- AS I SAID. AS WE ARE WORKING WITH THE SEAT WITH THE CONSERVATION CORPS PM COASTAL COMMISSION RATHER. UNDERSTOOD AND THE STOP RACIAL PUBLIC ACCESS ISSUES- OF ANY POTENTIAL DECISION RELATED DEPARTMENTS POSITION ON LEGAL CHALLENGES WOULD NEED TO BE A CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE COUNCIL SO AT THIS POINT I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THEY JUST PUT IT JUST AS A COMMENT IT'S THE ISSUE OF WHETHER. STATE PARKS COMPLIES WITH THIS SORT OF IT IS THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF LEGAL ACTION IS TAKEN TO FIGHT THE DECISION. FROM WHAT WE'VE THAT AND THEN GO TO THE OTHER ISSUE THAT IS BIG AND BIG BASS AND PARK WHICH WAS THE FIRST NON YOU SOMEBODY PARK IN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM 95% OF IT BURNED LAST SUMMER. AND THE PARK IS CLOSED EVERY FACILITY WHEN I DROVE THROUGH A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FIRE. YOU COULD NOT EVEN TELL WHERE SOME OF THE FORMER FACILITIES WHERE IT JUST BURNS SO HOT AND THROUGH THERE WERE VIEWS THAT NEVER EXISTED BEFORE. AND THE PARK IS CLOSED AND IS GOING TO BE CLOSED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. ONE OF THE PLANS BECAUSE THERE'S SOME LOCAL CONCERN ABOUT MY AND PARTS OF IT MIGHT RE OPEN AND WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL SITUATION OR ARE YOU BEING REIMBURSED. FOR DISASTER FUNDS TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AND WHAT IS THE SCHEDULE OF PLANNING AND HOW THE PUBLIC WILL BE INVOLVED IN AND WHEN THERE MIGHT BE EVEN PARTIAL ACCESS. THANK YOU FOR THE SET OF QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO BIG BASS OH I JUST MENTIONED THAT. MY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB AS DIRECTOR. I WAS SWORN IN AT THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER AND SPENT THE DAY AT THE BIG BASS IN HER QUARTERS. UP WHILE THE PARK WAS LITERALLY STILL SMOLDERING- AND- I'LL LET ME TELL YOU. V. ANSWERS OF THE QUESTION OR QUESTIONS THAT YOU JUST ASKED- FIRST OF ALL WELL I'LL BE AT THE HIGHEST. THAT THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS BIZARRE AXLES. WHEN THERE'S A DEVASTATING FIRE- IN A FORESTED AREA ONE OF THE FACTS IS THAT A LOT OF THOSE TREES OR WEAKENED. AND ACTUALLY. FALL IN CREATING EXTRAORDINARY HAZARD- STATE PARKS IS ALTHOUGH WE'VE ALREADY SPENT. THREE MILLION DOLLARS MOVING RECALL HAS BEEN TRIMS JUST ALONG THE ROADS THROUGH THE PARK. AND WE CONTINUE TO BE LOOKING AT SAFETY HAZARDS WHICH IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN BEFORE VISITORS CAN VISIT THE PARK. AND SO THE TIME AT WHICH THE PARK WILL BE OPEN FOR PEOPLE TO EVEN SEE THINGS ITS USE- RECENTLY- IS STILL OUT ON THE HORIZON I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC DATE. BUT REALLY THE CLOSURE IS. DUE TO VISIT OUR SAFETY. WE IMMEDIATE ASSUME. TEAM POST FIRE TO START THINKING ABOUT. HOW DO WE READ THIS FIRST STATE PARK IT WAS JUST. AND WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND REALLY WHAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IS REBUILD A STATE PARK WHAT IS FUTURE. WHAT IS A STATE PARK LOOK LIKE IN THE CENTURY WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO INCLUDE SUSTAINABLE THE SIGNS. ARE WE PUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. UTILITIES HOW CAN WE PLACE THESE TO PROTECT THE RESOURCES BUT ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES. FOR THE PUBLIC THAT'S VISITING UP. WE ARE LOOKING AT OVERALL PLANNING AS WE PLAN THE PARK HAVING TO DO WITH HABITAT AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT. AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE THINKING OF A PARK THAT IS ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL AND AS WE'VE SEEN WITH KOBE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE VISITORS THAN THERE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST VIRTUALLY ALL THE PARKS. SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE GUIDING NATIONAL JUST. AB IS A QUICKLY AND THAT. ARE PART TEAMS HAVE ALREADY. PUT TOGETHER A BASIC. FRAMEWORK OF A PLAN I THINK OF IT IS SETTING THE TABLE. FOR WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AND WE'RE PREPARING TO DO A PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AS LITERALLY AS WE REIMAGINE. WHAT THE BIG BASS AND FOR THE NEXT CENTURY IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO WORK ON THE RECOVERY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY PLACE. AT THE SAME TIME POTENTIALLY BE SETTING NEW STANDARDS. IN TERMS OF HOW WE LOOK. AT WHAT PARTS NEED TO BE HELD PARTS NEED TO BE MANAGED AND TAKEN CARE OF GOING INTO THE NEXT CENTURY. WITH YOUR QUESTION REGARDING FINANCING WE HAVE MANY WE HAVE SUBMITTED A REQUEST FOR REIMBURSEMENTS FROM FEMA AND OTHER AGENCIES AND WE ARE LOOKING AT VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES TO HELP. ADVANCE THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND I CAN ALSO SAY THAT ARE PART PARTNERS IN SEEING THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED ARE ALREADY FUND RAISING TO PARK IT WAS PARKS AS WE REBUILD THIS FIRST STATE PART. OF THE FIRST BIG PART IN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL AND THERE ARE PEOPLE. OF LOCAL YOU'RE VERY INTERESTED IN JUST GETTING IN WHEN IT IS SAFE BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY THINK THEY CAN EVEN HELP RAISE MONEY SO THAT'S AN- IMPORTANT THING. I HAD A CUTTING EDGE I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON THE BUDGET A. M. ONE IS THAT. THE FIRST MAJOR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO THE PARK SYSTEM CAME FROM THE TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL. AND IT WAS SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. A HAVE YOU INVESTED THAT AND THAT HASN'T BEEN OFFSET BY ANY CUT IN THE GENERAL FUND DRIVE THAT IS A SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR MOVE AHEAD IN THE PARKS BUDGET. THAT'S CORRECT INITIALLY WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE EIGHTY BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE IT IS SIXTY EIGHT MILLION AND IT IS NOT BEING UP. THERE ISN'T ANYTHING COMING OUT OF OUR BASE BUDGET AS A RESULT OF THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND WHAT KINDS OF THINGS ARE YOU ABLE TO DO THAT YOU WEREN'T DOING BEFORE NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE FIRST BIGGEST SLUG OF ADDITIONAL MONEY IN. RECENT YEARS. WELL IT'S AN EXCITING PROSPECT WHAT WE DID IS WE LOOKED IT UP- FILLING THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WE'VE ALREADY FILLED TWO THIRDS OF THOSE POSITIONS. MOST OF US AREN'T MAINTENANCE AND WITH CODE AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED THAT WORK IS SLOW DOWN. BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO OBLIGATE ALL OF THOSE FUNDS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND THAT LEADS TO THE QUESTION ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SO WHAT'S THE BALANCE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN THE PARK SYSTEM AT THIS POINT. WELL FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE ARE LOOKING AT- BEING ABLE TO INVEST. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN IN OUR CURRENT BUDGET PASS. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH REGARDS TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. IS A FEW YEARS AGO WE WORK WITH THE STATE PARKS COMMISSION ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORK THE PRIORITIES OF A PRIORITY SAME PROCESS RATHER- AND THE PROJECT SELECTION CITERIA INCLUDES GLORIFIED ASPECTS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY. FEASIBILITY AND PERMITTING CRITICALITY OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND SAVING AND CODE COMPLIANCE AND WHEN THESE ARE EVALUATED TO GET MENTAL MERICLE SCHOOL. AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS. FOR ORDER KEEP DANCE TO LOWEST AND WE HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR IS BEING ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES SO EVERY TIME WE LOOK AT A PROJECT GET IT COULD THROUGH THE SCORING PROCESS AND IT'S ADDED TO THE LIST. AND OUR IDEA IS THAT SHOULD WE ARE. OPPORTUNITY ARISE THAT WE GET FUNDING FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DOLLARS WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA BE PREPARED WITH PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO GO WHETHER IT'S- A SINGLE GET A SINGLE. PROJECT VALUE OF INCOME OR FUNDING RATHER FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INCOME OR FUNDING AND WE HAVE THESE PROJECTS GO. AND READY TO GO AND THEY DO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE SOMETIMES FUNDING COMES AND IT TAKES CARE OF A PROJECT UNLESS. SOMETIMES A NEW PROJECT GETS EVALUATED MOST OF THE TOP OF THE LIST. SO IT'S A IT'S A MOVING TARGET BUT WE ARE. POISED I THANK YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF STREAMS OF FUNDING THAT COULD REALLY MAKE A DENT IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I APPRECIATE THAT. I HAVE SOME VAGUE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT PRIORITIES ARE SETTING PROCESS FROM HERE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THERE WERE ESTIMATES OF HOW MUCH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WISE. AT ONE POINT IT WAS UP TO AS HIGH AS A BILLION DOLLARS DO YOU HAVE ANY CURRENT ESTIMATE OF. HOW MUCH IS IN THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. IT'S HARD THAN BILLION- AND IF. BUT I CAN'T BE IN A MINUTE TO GET THAT NUMBER TO YOU BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT'S HIGHER THAN BILLION. AND THEN ONE LAST BUDGET QUESTION. A PARKS WAS ALLOCATED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM THE MARIJUANA DESTRUCTIVE IN THE TAX MONEY ARE YOU RECEIVING THAT MONEY. WHAT'S IT GO FOR. WE ARE- WE ACTUALLY HELLO THERE WAS AN ASSESSMENT- HAVING TO DO IS GOING TO DIRECT THAT MONEY THANK YOU FOR ASKING THIS QUESTION AND IT REALLY LOOKS TO BE MEDIATION HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE IMPACT OF MARIJUANA GROWS AND FUNDING THAT'S RELATED TO- SUPPORTING THE MARIJUANA ERADICATION AND THERE ARE THINGS ON THERE THAT ALSO. EGRESS AND M. AND- INGRESS THE ROADS OF THE PASSENGER BUILT INTO THESE PLACES. AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT COMES FROM BORROWED FROM. THE MARIJUANA INITIATIVE IS SPLIT BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND STATE PARKS. STATE PARKS GETS 40% AND STATE OFFICIALS GET 60% INTERESTING BECAUSE I WONDERED WHAT THAT SPLIT. I TOLD YESTERDAY IN THE MEETING THAT INITIALLY STATE PARKS THOUGHT THEY DESERVED 80% AND LIKE TWO. AND WHILE I THOUGHT THEY DESERVED EIGHTY AND PARKS TWENTY SO I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR THE SWEAT THEN I WANTED TO ASK YOU WHEN THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT- NOW SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO. THERE WAS A MAJOR REFORM PROCESS UNDERTAKEN TO REFORM DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE PARK SYSTEM I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE STATUS OF SOME OF THOSE REFORMS IN ONE OF FROM. THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT IS THAT IT USED TO BE THAT YOU HAD TO BE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE IN MANAGEMENT IN CERTAIN KEY PIECES OF THE SYSTEM AND IT WAS REFORM TO ALLOW ANYBODY TO PROMOTE FROM ANY PART OF THE DEPARTMENT AND IT WAS. A DIVERSITY ISSUE AS PART OF A JUST A MORALE ISSUE WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT IN FILLING THE POSITIONS AND WHO HOLDS THE POSITION. SET AT THAT REGIONAL LEVEL- ARE WHOLE TO THAT DID. AND THE PREVIOUS DIRECTOR- AS AS YET I THINK YOU'RE WELL AWARE WORKED ON THAT. AND WE ARE APPOINTING SUPERINTENDENTS IN SUPERMAJORITY- MANAGERS WHO DO NOT HAVE A COMMISSION. OF WHICH IS IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CERTIFICATION- AND BAGGAGE- AND IT WE ARE ANNOUNCING POSITIONS ARE RECRUITING FOR WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS NON BADGE. OF PROFESSIONALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT- PROFESSIONALS. CAN APPLY FOR THE POSITIONS BUT THEY CAN NO LONGER BE PEACE OFFICERS IF THEY GO INTO THOSE POSITIONS. AND THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH STATE PARKS THAT UP TILL EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO YOU ALMOST COULD NOT PAY ELECTRONICALLY ANYWHERE IT WAS CASH ONLY. AND THERE WAS THIS ELABORATE PROCESSES START TO MOVE TO THE ABILITY TO PAY ELECTRONICALLY ACROSS THE STATE PARKS WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT THIS WE'VE ACTUALLY MODERNIZE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- CENTER LAYERED- WE'VE MODERNIZE YOUR RESERVATION SYSTEMS ACTUALLY OPERATED BY. A CONTRACT IN RESERVES CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY DID THEY COLLECT REVENUE BUT THEY ALSO COLLECT DATA WHICH IS REALLY USEFUL FOR US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS ARTS ARTS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THESE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX I THINK SEPARATE LOCATIONS THAT ARE INTEGRATED WITH RESERVE CALIFORNIA. WITH TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PARKS- PEOPLE CAN USE CREDIT CARDS FOR PAYMENT AND THERE'S ALSO. NEW TECHNOLOGY OUT CARDS WITH PEOPLE CAN PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD OR IN SOME CASES EVEN OF FOLLOWED. BY ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING A PARKS IS WE'VE BEEN ADDING WIFI CAPABILITY AT PARKS AND RIGHT NOW ABOUT A THIRD OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS HAVE. WIFI INCOME AVAILABLE FOR VISITORS AND BECAUSE SOME OF THE PARKS ARE IN VERY REMOTE LOCATIONS AND WIFI IS A DIFFICULT THING TO GET SET UP. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STATE PARKS. THAT HAVE WIFI. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO- DO THEIR STATE BUSINESS SO YOU'RE PHASING OUT THE SO CALLED IRON RANGERS. YES AND THEN ANOTHER OF THE DIGITAL ISSUES IS THAT GOOGLE WORKED IN CONCERT WITH THE STATE PARK SYSTEM TO DIGITISE THE TRIALS AND PUT THEM ONLINE SO PEOPLE COULD SEE WHAT THEY WERE GETTING INTO BEFORE WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT PROJECT HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I MEAN THE MULTI MEDIA WORLD IS A IS AN AREA THAT PARTS IS REALLY STEPPING INTO M. AS PART PARTNERS- AND OTHER GROUPS COMING IN LIGHT WILL TRACTOR IT'S REALLY AN ADVANTAGE TO THE VISITORS- AND RIGHT NOW THERE ARE FIFTY. A LITTLE OVER FIFTEEN STATE PARKS WHERE YOU CAN GO AND LOOK AT GOOGLE TREKKER WHICH LITERALLY YOU CAN WALK WITH SOMEBODY DOWN A TRAIL WHOSE NEWS CARRIED A BACKPACK WITH THE CAMERA AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT THE LANDSCAPE OF THE COAST AREA LOOKS LIKE- AND THEY'RE ALSO FIFTY STATE BEACHES WHERE YOU CAN FIND APPROVAL TRACKER WALKS ONLINE AND WE ARE LOOKING AT PLACES WHERE WE CAN- OFFER SIMILAR ACTIVITIES IN TERMS OF GOING INTO A HISTORIC BUILDING OR HISTORIC COMPLEX THEY GONNA DOBIE AND I DO KNOW FROM EVERYWHERE DECEMBER SAID THAT THERE WAS A BIG PROJECTS TO. DIGITIZE ALL OF BODHI SO THAT A VISITOR REMOTELY COULD LITERALLY WALKS REBOTE AND GO AGAINST BUILDINGS AND IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY. FOR MORE ACCESS TO PARKS. AND THEN THERE WAS THIS% WHY GROUP SO UP THE A STATEWIDE NOT. TO RAISE MONEY TO ASSIST THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT GROUP. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT CARS CALIFORNIA WHATEVER FRIENDS GROUPS YEAH- THEY ARE AN AMAZING PARTNER ALONG WITH THE OTHER PART PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE. A PARKS CALIFORNIA IS A LITTLE SEPARATING WARRIOR YOU'RE- A CLASS ACT GOVERNMENT AT ALL GROUP. WE MAY WITH THEM AND OUR OTHER PART PARTNERS REGULARLY SO THAT WE ARE COORDINATING OUR EFFORTS RELATIVE TO PROJECT PRIORITIES AND FUND RAISING NEEDS OF AND PARKS CALIFORNIA IS I THINK A VERY IT'S A ROBUST ORGANIZATION AS ARE THE OTHERS- THE OF THE- SEMPERVIRENS FUND SAVE THE REDWOODS LEAGUE. AND THE STATE PARKS FOUNDATION THEIR OTHER PARTNERS BECAUSE OUR FOR THE BIG ONES AND THEY REALLY ARE CRUCIAL OF NOT ONLY IN HELPING US ADVANCE OUR PRIORITIES OUT INTO THE PUBLIC. WITH THINGS LIKE ACCESS FOR ALL. AND ARE. INITIATIVE BUT WITH OF THE CAR WORKING OF WITH CAL. IS I BELIEVE- IT'S A GREAT PARTNER AND REALLY AND IT'S EXCITING EVOLUTION THAT PARTNERING PARKS WITH. YOU MENTIONED OTHER PARTNERS IN THE INTERESTING THING WAS IS THERE WAS NOT A LEGAL FRAMEWORK UNDER STATE LAW. TO HAVE PARTNERS FOR INDIVIDUAL PARKS BE FORMALLY RECOGNIZED AND- THAT WAS A DON AND THE M. AS IN THE- UNTIL SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS GO PARKS DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR HOW MUCH EACH INDIVIDUAL PART COST IT WAS ONLY BY REGION AND SO YOU COULD IF YOU WANT TO HELP AN INDIVIDUAL PARK YOU COULD FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE YOU CAN FIGURE OU. HOW MUCH IT COST. SO WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO FORM INDIVIDUAL PARK. GROUPS FOR PARK AT THIS POINT. YOU INCLUDED SEVERAL THINGS THAT QUESTION LET ME JUST SAY ONE THING BEFORE I ANSWER THE REST OF IT AND THAT IS THAT- I UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU COULDN'T TELL. HOW A BUDGET WAS BEING ALLOCATED WITHIN A DISTRICT- BUT TODAY WITH SERVICE BASED BUDGETING YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHERE MONEY IS GOING TO A PROJECT. TO PARK TO DISTRICT SO THAT SORT OF FINANCIAL TRACKING HIS IN PLACE AND AGAIN THAT'S DUE TO SERVICE. UP SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. AND THE RELATIVE TO- PART PARTNERS. AND PARKS THERE'S A COUPLE OF DISTINCTIONS. OF ONE OF THEM IS THAT- ANY PARK CAN HAVE A PARK PARKER. THAT RAISES MONEY FOR THE MINUTE MIGHT BE A SMALL LOCAL GROUP. OF WHICH THAT EXIST ALL OVER THE STATE WHERE IT CAN BE A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP THAT DOES FUNDRAISERS OF SORTS. BUT IT CAN ALSO BE LARGER GROUPS THAT LIKE THE ONES THAT I MENTIONED THAT MIGHT RAISE FUNDS FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF PARKER'S CERTAIN REGION OF PARKS. BUT I MENTIONED THERE'S TWO OTHER THINGS THAT APPLY TO YOUR- QUESTION I BELIEVE IN ONE OF THEM IS THAT. PARKS PARTNERS WITH MUNICIPALITIES AND PUBLIC AGENCIES TO HELP MANAGE PARKS SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE STATE PARKS. THEY BELIEVE THERE'S ABOUT FIFTY STATE PARKS THAT ARE MANAGED BY REGIONAL PARK SYSTEMS AND LOCAL PARK SYSTEMS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PARKS THEY- DELIVER THE SERVICES THAT STATE% PARKS DOES NAY. THEY OFTENTIMES HAVE. SIGNAGE THAT INDICATES THAT THIS IS A CALIFORNIA STATE PARK AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER TYPE OF PARTNER. WHICH IS A- WE HAVE NON PROFITS THAT ARE MANAGING PARKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PARKS AND WITH THOSE PARKS WE HAVE CO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS SO FAR THAT IS WHAT WAS NOT ALLOWED CO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS THERE WAS NO LEGAL FRAMEWORK FORTY FOUR RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NINE OF THOSE IN PLACE AND I THINK THAT LEGISLATION ALLOWED FOR TWENTY OF THEM. AND WE DON'T REALLY MAKES ALL OF THIS TECH AND WORK WELL IS WE HAVE A NEW PARTNERSHIPS OFFICE AND SO IT'S EXCITING BECAUSE EACH OF THESE- EFFORTS ARE CREATING- BASICALLY THE EXPERTISE WITHIN PARKS TO BE ABLE TO WORK. WITH ALL OF THE- COMPLEXITIES OF WORKING WITH THESE NEW PARTNERS AND I SEE THAT. AS REALLY AN EXCITING PATH FOR THE FUTURE THAT INCREASES SUPPORT FOR PARKS. THAT DIVERSIFIES THE MANAGEMENT OF PARKS WHILE KEEPING TO THE SPIRIT AND TO THE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARK SYSTEM. THE REAL STRENGTH S. AND THEN OFTEN WE HAVE ONE LAST. QUESTION AND YOU WERE IT WAS INTERESTING YOU RAISED IT IN YOUR YOUR PUBLIC COMMENTS YOU TALKED ABOUT PARK ACQUISITIONS. AND I KNOW THERE WAS THIS STORY NEWS STORY THAT WAS A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF AGO THAT BASICALLY SAID- STATE PARKS HAS BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH THINGS AND- IN RECENT YEARS AND YET. THE STATE BOND MEASURES THAT HAVE PASSED FOR PARKS. RUN MONEY THROUGH THE STATE FOR LOCAL URBAN PARKS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THERE WERE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF UNDERSERVED PEOPLE. AND SO AND THE PARKS FORWARD THE REFORM PROCESS SAID THERE SHOULD BE A PARK EVERY SO OFTEN. AND THEY WERE RELEASE NOT DRAWING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN STATE PARKS AND MONEY FOR URBAN PARKS WHERE THERE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. A AND YET YOU ALSO SAID. GOOD TALKING ABOUT ACQUISITION OF NEW PARKS SO. ARE ARE YOU COMMITTED TO THAT PROCESS OF THE URBAN PARKS MONEY GOING THERE THE WHITE SPECIFIED AND DO YOU HAVE ACQUISITIONS. IN LINE AND I KNOW YOU SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MOLESTED THE PRICE UP. DO YOU HAVE THINGS THAT YOU'RE THINKING. OF FOR THE PARKS SYSTEM ITSELF. AGAIN THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED YOUR HITTING A NUMBER OF OUR VERY HIGH PRIORITIES. AND WE ARE LOOKING AND WE CONTINUE TO KEEP A FOLIO OF. OF POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS THAT WE CAN MAKE AND THOSE ACQUISITIONS CAN BE ABOUT. LANDS IT REALLY INCREASE ACCESS CAN BE ABOUT LANDS THAT ARE UNIMPORTANT CONNECTING PEACE WITHIN AN EXISTING STATE PARK OR IT CAN BE LANDS AND ACTUALLY BRING UP A VERY CRITICAL ELEMENT OF A- PARTICULARLY PROTECTED LANDSCAPE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT INTO AN EXISTING STATE PARK. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT ACQUISITIONS BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE TO I THINK TO YOUR QUESTION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS. AND FOR ME THIS WAS A SURPRISE WHEN I. STEPPED INTO THIS POSITION. TAKE PARKS HAS THREE GRANTS PROGRAMS ONE IN STATE PARKS WHICH IS IN THE OFFICE OF GRANTS AND LOCAL SERVICES ONE IN THE OFFICE. WE B. E. ICAL PROGRAM AND OFFER YOU. A VEHICLE PROGRAM IN THE BOATING AND WATERWAYS PROGRAM WHICH ALSO HAS GRANTS ARE BOTH FUNDED BY GAS TAXES THE OFFICE OF GRANTS AND LOCAL SERVICES THIS GRANT IS FUNDED BY THINGS LIKE PROPOSITION EIGHT- M. PROP ONE OR SB ONE AND ON THE LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND IN THOSE SORTS OF MONIES. I WAS REALLY SURPRISED WHEN I DISCOVERED OR REALIZED THAT SINCE HE YEAR TWO THOUSAND STATE PARKS HAS DIRECTED COMMUNITY GRANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SINCE INSTEAD COME. SINCERE TWO THOUSAND TO THE TUNE OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS. AND THESE FUNDS HAVE GONE TO THINGS LIKE NATURE CENTERS TRAILS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND ZOOS BUILDING A COMMUNITY POOL FOR A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY THAT DIDN'T HAVE A POOL. I MEAN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT DELIVERY OF RESOURCES TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY WANT TO DO AND AM ALREADY STARTING TO DO IS TO PROMOTE THE FACT THAT STATE PARKS IS ALSO DIRECTING FUNDS TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FEEL OWNERSHIP ABOUT THE PARKS AND NOTHING LIKE OWNERSHIP AROUND PARKS LIKE HAVING ONE IN YOUR TOWN. WELL THE NEXT TIME PAUL ROGERS CALLS YOU AND SAYS THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY MONEY PUT INTO STATE PARKS IN RECENT YEARS YOU START THAT STATISTIC IN EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO THAT HE KNOWS THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. IN ANY EVENT. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TRACKING WITH ME ON ALL THE QUESTIONS AND OBVIOUSLY I COULD HAVE GONE ON BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK. OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THEIR INDULGENCE BECAUSE I THOUGHT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE PARKS DIRECTOR WHICH WE BARELY HAVE A CRACK AT. ARE THERE ARE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ISSUES AND COMPLEXITIES AND- ARE JUST APPRECIATE EVERYBODY OF BEARING WITH US GETTING INTO A MESS HERE. THE SENATOR LIAR THANK YOU SO MUCH- WE APPRECIATE YOU ASKING THE QUESTIONS- IT'S IMPORTANT- WITH THAT LET ME. IT'S NOT OFTEN WE HAVE THE FORMER SECRETARY- AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WHO KNOWS A LOT MORE THAN MOST OF US DO SO. I THINK IT ALLOWS US TO LEARN A LOT- THAT WE WOULDN'T ORDINARILY HAVE. HAVE THAT LEVEL OF INFORMATION SO WE APPRECIATE IT- EVEN AS WE LAMENT YOUR- DIRECTOR YOU'RE HAVING TO ANSWER ALL THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT. ACTUALLY IT'S GOOD- LET ME GO TO- THE VICE CHAIR NOW FOR HER COMEDY QUESTIONS CENTERED BATES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M- DIRECTOR CAN TOP QUINTERO I THINK I GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION EARLIER IN THE DAY SO IN THE ON ON. MY GOOD COLLEAGUE TO THE RIGHT TO THEIR- COVERED MUCH OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED OUT THERE WAS ONE AREA THAT I DIDN'T ASK ABOUT. AND DOOR QUICKLY ON THE QUICK QUESTION ON THE HARBOR AND WATER WATER CRAFT REVOLVING FUND- AND THE POTENTIAL REGISTRATION FEE INCREASES ON VESSELS YOU KNOW DANA POINT HARBOR. FONG AND OCEANSIDE HARBOR OR IN MY DISTRICT SO I'VE HAD FUN A FEW EMAILS LATELY REGARDING ON THE POTENTIAL FOR. THE REGISTRATION FEES FOR OUR ON BOTH ARE GOING UP AND ONE WAS KIND OF OUT OF THE PARK SAID IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND SOME PERCENT AND I SAID I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THERE'S BEEN A DECISION ON THAT AT THE MOMENT BUT CHAO WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THAT AND HERE YOU ARE SO. MAYBE GIVE ME A KIND OF AN IDEA OF WHY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE GOING ON TO DETERMINE HOW TO MEET THE INSOLVENCY IN THE FUNDED BUT NOT. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD ON THE VIEW THE- VEHICLE LICENSE FEES ON THEIR BULLETIN EDITION TO THEIR CARS AND EVERYTHING ELSE FILL OUT HOW ARE YOU LOOKING ON THAT AND KNOW WHAT WHAT'S THE DIRECTION. IT THAT HAPPENS GOOD AFTERNOON SURVEYS IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THAT IMPORTANT QUESTION- THE VOTER REGISTRATION MEANS- OR BOAT REGISTRATION FEES HAVE NOT CHANGED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE. THEY ARE STILL WHAT THEY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHICH IS TEN DOLLARS A YEAR- AND THAT'S ANY SIZE BOAT- AND SO. WHAT HAPPENED IS THERE'S BEEN A REDUCTION IN THE FUNDING. FOR THE MONIES ARE USED TO DO THINGS LIKE- REMOVES- HAZARDOUS OR RATHER NAVIGATION HAZARDS TO REMOVE THE INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES AND WATER WAYS AND SUCH AND OTHER. OTHER EXPENSES LIKE THAT AND SO WHAT WE DID IS. WE LOOKED AT BORDER REGISTRATION FEES ACROSS THE NATION AND THE PROPOSED REGISTRATION FEE THAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE IS THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR ALL PER BOAT. AND THAT'S STILL IN THE LOWEST 5% WE WERE THE LOWEST FEE IN THE NATION AT TEN DOLLARS WE ARE THE LOWEST FEE IN THE NATION AT TEN DOLLARS FOR VOTER REGISTRATION AND IF WE BRING IT TO THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS WE'RE STILL GONNA BE IN THE BOTTOM FIVE. OF THIS NATION IN TERMS OF VOTER REGISTRATION FEES AND I DO RECOGNIZE THAT A CHANGE IN RATES CHANGE FEES. CAN BE REALLY SHOCKING- BUT WE THIS REALLY IS MAKING US LOOK AT HOW ARE THOSE FEES ASSESSED AND HOW FOR EXAMPLE HOW CAN FEES PERHAPS JUST KEEP UP WITH THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- BUT IT IT I. I RECOGNIZE THE SHOCK IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING I'VE SEEN HAPPEN ALSO IN THE WIDER WORLD WAS WATER RATES- AND- SO IT'S A IT IS A PROBLEM WE ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUING IN A PUBLIC PROCESS AS WE SET THAT FEE AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO A NUMBER OF GROUPS FROM THE BOATING COMMUNITY. BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT THE PICTURE CLEAR THAT IT'S TEN DOLLARS A YEAR THE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR AND WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE IN THE BOTTOM FIVE OF THE NATION AT THAT RATE. SO WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE. THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING I AM PLEASED TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE PURSUING IT THROUGH LIKE THE VOTER ON ORGANIZATIONS THAT TIME CERTAINLY ARE THE MOST INTERESTED AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE AND WITH THE RECREATIONAL BOATING OUT THERE SO ENJOYABLE ALONG OUR COAST AND I JUST KEEP WATCH ON OUT TO. BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME PERHAPS SOME MISINFORMATION ON IN TERMS OF WHEN IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND SOME. PERCENT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND I SAW I DID THINK WE'RE VERY. BUT I WILL CERTAINLY CLEAR FRIDAY AND THEN ON WELL JUST KEEP IN TOUCH WITH AND HOW THAT IS LOOKING SO I CAN GET OUT TO THE VOTER GROUPS. LET'S SEE HERE- BEFORE THINGS GET KIND OF BILLS SO INTERPRETED. AND WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP OU INFORMED ON THE GRAIN WITHOUT TO HARPER SIGN I GET A LOT OF INPUT IF YOU WOULD IMAGINE. BUT THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL YOUR ANSWERS AND KNOCK I THINK MY COLLEAGUES TO THE RIGHT THERE ARE. COVERED COVERED EVERYTHING THAT I NEEDED. TO KNOW AND- HE- KNOW YOUR MY- BUT I KNOW. LEFT. THANK YOU AND- THANKS TAKING THE TIME IT WAS A GREAT CONVERSATION PRITCHETT OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES ON MOVES TO CENTER GROVE THANK YOU I'M MATTER PRO TEN- THANK YOU DIRECTOR PRINTER FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND ALLOWING US TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS I DO HAVE TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY'S COMMENTS ABOUT- OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CRUZ WHO ASKED ALMOST EVERY QUESTION THAT THAT I HAD. A SPECIFICALLY ON THE OCEANIA DUNES AND- THE CONFLICT THAT HAS ARISEN OVER THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF- EIGHT YEARS IN MY COMMUNITY. ET BUT I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CRUZ DID ASK AND IF IT HAD TO DO WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT IDENTIFIED. A ONE POINT THREE BILLION IT'S OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IT'S THE NUMBER I HAVE IS A LITTLE OVER ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. AND SO I GUESS IN YOUR OPINION- HOW SHOULD THE DEPARTMENT BALANCE THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING PARKS THAT WE HAVE THEY'RE IN DESPERATE NEED OF MAINTENANCE- IN OKAY AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU HAVE NEW PARK SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE NEW PARKS- THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE THERE WHAT YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. ONE OF MY ANSWERS TO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HAD TO DO WITH PARTNERSHIPS. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS- THAT WE LOOK AT. IN TERMS OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE REALLY WHEN. BECAUSE WHEN WE GET A PARTNER IN PLACE IN STATE CO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OR A PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT WITH THE MUNICIPALITY. WHICH COULD BE A CITY OR COUNTY- THAT IS WHAT WE SEEN COST EFFICIENCIES- OF. THOSE BASICALLY THEY OPERATE THE PARKS AS WE WOULD. R. COSTA FAR REDUCE WE STILL ARE THEY HAVE BEEN PURCHASED IN STATE PARK PURCHASED WITH STATE PARK FUNDS. AND WE ALL ARE ABLE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE ENTITIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MANAGED- IN THE FRAMEWORK THAT STATE PARKS MANAGES PARKS SO THAT IS A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF FUNDING WE DO LOOK. AT FACT THAT IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA WILL BE LOOK AT- PROPERTIES ARE LANDS WHAT IS IT GOING TO COST. WHAT IS IT GOING TO COST TO MANAGE AND OR WILL WE BE ABLE TO DO IT AND IF WE CAN'T DO IT WHAT KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS COULD MAKE THIS WORK IF IT'S A HIGH PRIORITY. THANK YOU. I DO HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION YOU KNOW WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING I'M NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS OUR NATION ON A RE EXAMINING OUR PAST IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. I KNOW THAT- PARKS ARE NO DIFFERENT AND GIVE IT THE PARKS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE GONNA LOOK AT A LIST OF NAMES OF PARKS THAT REST ABLATION. UNDER THAT AND RE EXAMINING OUR PAST CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOUR VISION IS IN YOUR GOALS ON THAT INITIATIVE WOULD BE. AND IS IT GOING TO BE INCLUSIVE AND INCLUDE ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT WOULD HAVE- ED A DIVERSE OPINIONS. OF RENAMING SPECIFIC PARTS OF PARKS I AM. I AM NO WAY DISMISSING ANY OF OUR NATION'S PASTIME I JUST THINK THAT THERE IS- THERE IS A LOT OF HISTORICAL VALUE- GOOD OR BAD. THAT ARE DRESSED IN SOME OF THE NAMES OF OUR PARKS AND SERVICE JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS WERE ON THAT. SENATOR I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW. I KNOW WHAT THIS STORY BRINGS UP JUST IN ANY COMMUNITY THAT'S CONSIDERING NAME CHANGES. YEAH AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHAT WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER. IS A ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS- AND THAT INCLUDES BRINGING IN A HIGH LEVEL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. OF EXPERTS FROM UNIVERSITIES AND FROM A DIVERSITY OF PERSPECTIVES. HISTORIANS AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING. TO REVIEW NAMES A PROBLEM BEFORE THE GROUP- AND THAT WILL INCLUDE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS FINDING OUT WHAT THE WHOLE STORY BUT REALLY THE BASIS OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO. BECAUSE PARKS ARE ABOUT NATURAL HISTORY AND CULTURAL HISTORY AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE FULL STORY OF HISTORY NOT JUST HAVE NAMES THAT ARE REALLY REMAINS OR- STORIES ARE NOT TOLD THAN WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THROUGHOUT PARKS AND I CAN SEE THIS FROM MY PHONE BACK. BACKGROUND WHAT. THERE ARE NUMEROUS UNTOLD STORIES AND PARKS SO HOW DO THEY FIT TOGETHER IN TERMS OF PEOPLE'S FAMILY HISTORY IN A PARKING THE PLACES A DAY GONE AND VISITED AND COME TO KNOW AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ATTACHMENTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. TO NAMES- BUT WE WANT TO BE NOT ONLY VERY CAREFUL IN THE NAMES THAT WE CONSIDER BUT WE WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY TO USE THE WORD YOU USED INCLUSIVE. AND HOW WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS AND IF THERE'S ANY DECISION THAT WAS GOING TO BE MADE OR THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE NAY ABOUT A NAME OR A NAME CHANGE. THAT'S GOING TO GO TO THE CALIFORNIA PARKS COMMISSION AND THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC NOTICE AND IT WOULD BE A PUBLIC HEARING IN CONVERSATION. BEFORE THERE'S ANY STARTED CHANGE RELATIVE TO A NAME AND PARKS. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT I AM SEEING. THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CARSON IF YOU AREAS WHERE BIRDS HAVE. BEEN EFFORTS YOU- BEEN MADE. THE STORIES A FULLER STORY IT'S A DEEPER STORY IT'S A IT'S A BIGGER STORY AND NOTHING DISAPPEARS IT JUST BECOMES A BETTER STORE A BIGGER STORY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT IS THAT I REALLY BELIEVE. THAT PARKS NEED TO BE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY'RE THE TWO HUNDRED GENERATION FROM THIS WEEK. OR FIRST GENERATION AND SO AGAIN TO USE YOUR WORD OUR EFFORT. IS REALLY ABOUT INCLUSIVITY. AND I WILL JUST SAY QUICK AND THEN IS THAT. THE GOVERNOR. HAS ANOTHER IN. COMMITTEE WHICH IS CALLED THE CALIFORNIA ADVISORY ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON GEOGRAPHIC NAMES AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING. I JUST TALKED ABOUT PARTS. THANK YOU I DIRECTOR CAN TERO FOR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP THAT YOU'VE OFFERED. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE LET ME MOVE TO SENATOR COLLAR. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MISTER CONTATTO I THINK LAST TIME I SAW YOU YOU HAD GUITARS BEHIND YOU. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU MOVE THEM BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT US TO MENTION THEM. I KNOW TO PLAY- I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES I'VE WE HAD A WONDERFUL. DISCUSSION YOU AN ID EITHER ON MONDAY OR TUESDAY THAT'S HOW OLD MY BRAIN IS- AND WAS SO STRUCK BY YOU SHARING YOUR STORY AND TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU DECIDED TO. TAKE SOME TIME OFF TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU WERE- AND I THINK THAT. KIND OF SELF AWARENESS AND CONNECTEDNESS TO THE EARTH AND THE SPACES SO IMPORTANT I THINK FOR SOMEONE WHO IS IN YOUR POSITION TO LEAD OUR PARKS- YOU MENTIONED ACCESS A LOT IN YOUR RESPONSES AND YOU HAVE THIS VERY INTENSE TASK OF UNPACKING THAT WORD- AND REALLY SORT OF IDENTIFYING HOW WE WORK TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO OUTDOOR SPACE FOR PEOPLE. WHILE PROTECTING OUR OUTDOOR SPACE FROM PEOPLE AND HOW BOTH OF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN I'M SORT OF SIMULTANEOUSLY I THINK IS THE TASK THAT YOU HAVE AT HAND SO I SALUTE YOUR DESIRE TO WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT KIND OF WORK AND FIGURE IT UT MY QUESTION IS AROUND ACCESS- IT'S- VERY SPECIFIC. A FRIEND OF MINE WAS SHARING WITH ME- HOW YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS REALLY YOUNG HE JOURNEYED INTO A STATE PARK HE WAS ONE OF FOUR YOUNG BOYS FROM COMPTON. THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TO A STATE PARK YOU KNOW IN THEIR LIFE- RAMBUNCTIOUS YOU KNOW NEEDING SOME- REAL DISCIPLINE FROM THEIR PARENTS AND THEY CONNECTED WITH THESE TWO MENTORS SLASH GUIDES. WHO TOOK THEM FOR ABOUT A WEEK DEEP INTO ONE OF THE STATE PARKS- FOR THIS AMAZING EXPERIENCE WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE. THE STARS AT NIGHT YOU PACK IN WHAT YOU PACKED OUT YOU LEARN ABOUT YOU KNOW BEARS AND- ANIMALS IN WHO YOU ARE. AND YOU LEARN TO SURVIVE AND YOU LEARN TO. DEPEND ON YOU KNOW YOUR FELLOW TRAVELER. AND AFTER I LEARNED OF THE STORY I STARTED TO RESEARCH TO FIGURE OUT WHERE- OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THIS WOULD BE FOR OTHER FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT AND IN YOU KNOW PARK POOR COMMUNITIES- AS INTENSE AS THAT. EXPERIENCE AN OPPORTUNITY WAS RATHER THAN SORT OF A DATE TRIP YOU KNOW WHERE YOU GO WITH THE BUS AND YOU SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS ANNUALLY. AND WAS HAVING A VERY HARD TIME FINDING THEM AND SO I KNOW WHEN YOUR RESPONSES YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS FOR YOUTH BUT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD MAYBE EXPAND ON IF THERE ARE STILL PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. THAT ARE BEING OFFERED- AND IF NOT YOU KNOW ARE THERE ARE SORT OF- DISCUSSIONS IN PLACE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BRING SOME OF THOSE THINGS BACK BECAUSE I WAS. REALLY AWESTRUCK THAT SOMEONE. COULD SHARE A STORY FROM FORTY YEARS AGO WITH SUCH A RICHNESS AND CLARITY THAT I KNEW THAT THAT WAS AN EXPERIENCE THAT RESONATED WITH THAT PERSON STILL. AND HOW DO WE FIND WAYS TO REPLICATE THOSE KINDS OF EXPERIENCES FROM R. EIGHT POINT FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY. SENATOR THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL QUESTION. THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN PARKS WHICH YOU DO- DELIVER OPPORTUNITIES- IN OUR A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM WE ACTUALLY THE STATE PARKS BODIES CAMPING SUPPLIES SORT OF THE FAMILY SO THAT A FAMILY DOESN'T HAVE TO BUY A CAMPING SUPPLIES THAT THEY CAN CHECK OUT YOU JUST HAVE TO GO THROUGH A TRAINING ON HOW TO USE THAT AND THERE'S LOCKERS AT SEVERAL PARKS WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY. OF CHECK OUT THIS EQUIPMENT IT'S NOT TO THE LEVEL OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT I THINK WITH YOUR QUESTION RAISES IS AN ANSWER THAT IS REALLY ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS AND I CAN GIVE YOU I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU A LIST OF PARK PARTNERS ALL I'LL GIVE YOU ONE THERE'S ONE CALLED ENVIRONMENTAL TRAVELING COMPANIONS YEAH THEY STARTED YEARS AGO IN FACT. IN THE LAKE IN THE MID SEVENTIES I WORKED WITH THE FOUNDER WHEN THEY JUST STARTED WORKING AS A PARK RANGER AND WHAT IF BY MIDDLE TRAVELING COMPANIONS DOES IS IT TAKES PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED ON RIVER RAFTING TRIPS ON KAYAKING TRIPS ON SENATE ON SKIING TRIPS AND THEY ARE ONE OF THE PARTNERS IN PART PART IN AND- THE ONE OF THE PROPERTIES OF STATE PARKS EXCUSE. AND IT I AM AWARE AND HAVE WORKED WITH OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU SEE MERCED THERE ARE TWO PROGRAMS ONE OF THEM IS CALLED THE USE THAT MANY LEADERSHIP PROGRAM WHERE STUDENTS GO OUT WE ACTUALLY END UP WORKING IN YOU SOMEBODY IN THE SUMMERTIME DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR NOT ONLY ARE THEY TAKING CLASSES ON THAT CAMPUS BUT THEY'RE REACHING OUT TO SCHOOLS AND PUTTING TOGETHER PROGRAMS TO GET YOUNG CHILDREN YOUNG PEOPLE OUT. IN INTO PARTS WHETHER THEY'RE LOCAL OR NATIONAL OR STATE PARKS THERE'S ALSO AN INCREDIBLE PROGRAM CALLED AN ADVENTURE RISK CHALLENGE WHICH IS IN THE UC SYSTEM AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY TAKE. CHILDREN WHO ARE KIDS WHO ARE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL WHO. ARE FROM JUST ADVANTAGE CAN IN FAMILIES. AND THEY TAKE A INTO WILL JERRY. FOR THE FOR DAYS FORTY NIGHTS. AND IT IS IT IS A PROGRAM THAT'S GUIDED BY. INSTRUCTORS AND I HAVE WITNESSED A NUMBER OF THESE. STUDENTS RETURN FROM THOSE X. VARIANCES ABSENT. POLITICALLY CHANGE IF AND WHEN YOU MEANT IT WAS GIVING A TALK AFTER HE GOT ON HIS HEAD GROWING UP PICKING TOMATOES WITH THIS FAMILY IN FACT HE DIDN'T WASN'T GOING TO PROGRAM BECAUSE HE WAS PICKING ONE TO PICK TOMATOES. BUT AFTER COMING BACK AND GIVING A SPEECH ABOUT WHAT HE EXPERIENCED HE ENDED BY SAYING I WILL NEVER PICK TOMATOES GET- THE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOUR QUESTION RAISES. AN ASTOUNDING- UNDERSTANDING I DO THAT- I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING- APPEAR IN MORE PLACES IN CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO- SUPPORTING. YOU IN BEING ABLE TO BE A PARTNER WITH YOU- AS I MENTIONED IN OUR DISCUSSION- THERE YOU'RE SO ATTUNED TO THIS WORK I THINK YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR LIVED EXPERIENCE YOUR WORK EXPERIENCE. AND THE ENERGY AND VIBRATIONS THAT YOU BRING TO LIVING AND LOVING AND LEARNING ABOUT PARKS IS REALLY ADMIRABLE AND SO- I AM SO. VERY GRATEFUL TO- SUPPORT YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO FIGURING OUT WAYS THAT WE CAN BRING PARKS TO THE THIRTIETH SENATE-DISTRICT. THANK YOU SENATOR- WELL LESLIE OF I ONLY HAVE. ONE QUESTION AND SOME COMMENTS FOR THE pWANT TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO OF MY DISTRICT- STAFF COMMUNICATE QUITE FREQUENTLY WITH STATE PARKS ARE STAFF AND HAVE A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP AND HAVE HAD- JUST LONG TERM- THE ABILITY TO GET A GREAT ASSISTANCE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I WANT TO THANK YOU I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU'LL CARRY ON THAT I THOUGHT THAT. RELATIONSHIP I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR CHIEF DEPUTY FOR MEETING WITH MY STAFF. ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES. IN PARTICULAR JUST FOR THE RECORD AND TO PUT IT ON- THE RECORD MUCH LIKE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE ABOUT- SPECIFIC ISSUES ARE PROJECTS ARE PARTS THAT ARE VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO THEIR HEARTS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE SURPRISED TO HEAR ME PUT BORDER FIELD STATE PARK- IN FRONT OF YOU BECAUSE WE HAD THE CONVERSATION. WHICH I GREATLY APPRECIATE IT IS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. I KNOW THE FORMER SECRETARY REMEMBERS THIS IT'S A VITAL RECREATIONAL RESOURCE FOR MANY SAN DIEGANS. IT'S A DEEPLY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FOR MANY WHO WANT TO CONNECT WITH LOVED ONES ACROSS THE BORDER. A GREAT HISTORY TO THIS ODD TO THIS PARK. I IN PARTICULAR THE BORDER WALL FRIENDSHIP PARK. IT'S BEEN CLOSED I'D TO PUBLIC ACCESS FOR SOME TIME. AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- WE WORKED WITH THE FORMER- GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION BROUGHT ADMINISTRATION TO AUGMENT STATE PARKS FUNDING. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE FORMER SECRETARY WAS PART OF THAT CONVERSATION. ABOUT REPAIR AND RESTORATION OF THE PARKING REMOVAL OF CONTAMINATION FROM THE TIJUANA RIVER. SO I'VE BEEN MY STAFF HAS BEEN GIVEN A STATUS UPDATE ON ANY NUMBER OF THIS PROJECT AND I JUST WANNA. REQUEST FOLLOW UP ON THE ISSUE ON GOING WE WANT TO TRACK THIS. ARE GOING FORWARD- WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT AS YOU PROCEED ON THIS AND BE KEPT APPRISED OF ANY ACTION. BUT I FELT VERY COMFORTABLE HERE AND THE RESPONSE BACK FROM.
