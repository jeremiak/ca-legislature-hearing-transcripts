OF THIS REQUEST THANK YOU ANY

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:36.404

HELLO AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:39.441
CHAIR CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:41.042
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:42.977
I DESPITE RECENT DECLINES AND

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:43.945
FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM WE

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:45.847
FOUND THAT COMPLIANCE RATES WITH

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.482
THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:24:47.549 --> 01:24:48.883
QUITE HIGH. TO GIVE YOU AN

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:51.319
EXAMPLE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:53.521
EIGHTEEN ONLY FORTY SEVEN OUT OF

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:54.389
THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ELIGIBLE

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.090
OFFICERS FAILED TO MEET THEIR

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:57.425
REQUIRED TRAINING AMOUNT UNDER

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:58.359
THE PROGRAM.

01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:00.228
SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT PROVIDING

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:02.197
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES UNDER THE

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:04.466
EXISTING -- DISBURSEMENT FORMULA

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:06.234
AS HIS PROPOSED -- WOULD

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:08.269
ESSENTIALLY BE PAYING AGENCIES

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.038
MORE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE PRETTY

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:12.540
MUCH ALREADY DOING -- SO IT

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:13.541
DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THIS

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:16.878
PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A MEANINGFUL

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:17.979
IMPACT ON TRAINING.

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:18.580
IN ADDITION THE BOARD DOESN'T

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.615
COLLECT DATA ON THE TYPES OF

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:21.649
TRAINING THAT OFFICERS ARE

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.785
PURSUING TO MEET THEIR ANNUAL

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:24.419
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:25.153
PROGRAM.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.222
SO IT'S NOT FULLY CLEAR AT THIS

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:29.257
TIME WHAT TYPES OF TRAINING ARE

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.759
BEING SUPPORTED BY THE PROGRAM.

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:33.061
SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE

01:25:33.127 --> 01:25:34.963
PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT IT DOESN'T

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:36.197
APPEAR THAT TO HAVE A THAT IT

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.565
WOULD HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:38.566
ON TRAINING.

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.101
I IN ADDITION WE RECOMMEND

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:41.836
DIRECTING THE BSE SEE TO BEGIN

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:44.239
COLLECTING DATA ON THE TYPES OF

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:45.607
TRAINING THAT OFFICERS ARE

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:47.208
COMPLETING AS A PART OF THE

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:48.142
PROGRAM.

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:48.910
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THIS

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.545
INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:51.346
THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE WHEN

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:53.147
MAKING DECISIONS ON THIS PROGRAM

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.315
IN THE FUTURE.

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:55.984
HOWEVER IF THE IN THE MEANTIME

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:57.218
IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.621
ACCOMPLISH A PARTICULAR GOAL IN

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.055
IN THE NEAR TERM AND FOR EXAMPLE

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:02.790
IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IT

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:03.224
COULD.

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:06.194
CREATE A SEPARATE GRANT PROGRAM --

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.563
THAT IS MORE TARGETED AND

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:10.865
LIMITED TERM.

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:12.267
OKAY.

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.001
ANY OF QUESTIONS [inaudible]

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.736

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:15.937
DID YOU EVER SPONSOR OF THE ANY

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:20.008
OF THE ISSUES.

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:20.675
I WOULD JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WE

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:22.777
DO COLLECT DATA FROM EACH AND

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.846
EVERY PARTICIPATING AGENCY ON

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.080
PARTICIPATION WE ACTUALLY DO

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:27.549
MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:29.350
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS -- ANYONE

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:30.585
CAN EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:32.954
ABOUT WHAT HOW WHAT THE OROVILLE

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:33.588
WHICH OF COURSE WE'RE HAPPY TO

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:34.556
SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE RIGHT

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:36.024
AND THAT THE INFORMATION OF THE

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:37.392
DATE DATA THAT WAS BEING

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:39.160
REFERRED TO BY THE LA -- IS THAT

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:41.362
A TYPE OF A TRAINING THAT IS

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:42.931
USED TO COMPLETE THE ANNUAL

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:44.666
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ONLY SEVEN

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:46.034
HOURLY TRAINING REQUIREMENT FOR

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.001
THAT.

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:49.003
AND WE LEAVE THE CONTENT TO BE

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:50.471
DETERMINED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:51.906
BECAUSE THEY ARE MUCH MORE

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:53.641
PREPARED TO IDENTIFY SAID WITH

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:55.443
THE LOCAL PRIORITIES ARE THE

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:56.878
AGENCY REQUIREMENTS ARE.

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.580
AS WELL AS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:00.248
NEEDS OF THE EMPLOYEE ARE.

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.950
SO WE ALLOW THOSE DECISIONS TO

01:27:02.016 --> 01:27:03.551
BE MADE WE DO HAVE -- LOCALLY

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:04.786
AND WE DO HAVE A CERTIFICATION

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:06.988
SYSTEM SO WE COULD RUN QUERIES

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.389
BECAUSE EVERY COURSE HAS TO BE

01:27:08.456 --> 01:27:10.425
CERTIFIED OF OUR SYSTEM TO

01:27:10.491 --> 01:27:12.160
IDENTIFY WHERE IS TRAINING

01:27:12.226 --> 01:27:13.628
