THERE ARE NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF

WILDFIRES THAT. CAN BE

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:03.194
DISCUSSED THAT NEED TO BE

00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:05.763
DISCUSSED BUT TODAY'S HEARING

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.032
HAS A VERY LIMITED- BUT

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:10.001
IMPORTANT FOCUS ON WILDFIRE

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:11.703
PREVENTION. AND THE

00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:13.238
SPECIFICALLY THE NEED TO

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:14.973
INCREASE OUR INVESTMENTS IN

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.075
FIRE PREVENTION AND THE NEED TO

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:21.045
BE MORE STRATEGIC AND REGIONAL

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:22.847
IN OUR APPROACH TO PREVENTION.

00:31:22.914 --> 00:31:23.815
NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FIRE

00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:25.516
PREVENTION WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:27.919
FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS AND

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:30.288
PRESCRIBED BURNING AND- WELL

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:31.889
THESE PROJECTS ARE SUITABLE FOR

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:37.262
AREAS WITH EXCESSIVE. FUEL

00:31:37.328 --> 00:31:38.896
LOADS OR AREAS WITH FIRED. THE

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:39.631
PROJECTS MIGHT NOT BE A PRO FOR

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:42.300
AREAS LIKE THE CHAPARRAL- WHICH

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:43.868
IS COMMON- IN SOUTHERN

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:45.837
CALIFORNIA WHERE MEMBERS MANY-

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:48.473
OF OUR SIR FROM TODAY WE WILL

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.508
BE TAKING A DEEPER DIVE INTO

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.944
THE COMPLEXITY AND REGION ALLEY

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:55.546
OVER FIRE RISK AND THE NEED FOR

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.649
A MORE TAILORED TO MORE NUANCED

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.984
APPROACH. WE WILL LOOK AT

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:01.786
FACTORS SUCH AS WIND CONDITIONS

00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:04.088
VEGETATION TYPE AND THE

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:07.025
INFLUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON

00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:09.560
WILDFIRE RISK. THIS YEAR

00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:11.462
UNFORTUNATELY WE YET AGAIN

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.231
BROKE ANOTHER WILDFIRE RECORD

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:15.366
AND ON OCTOBER FOURTH WE

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.268
SURPASSED FOUR MILLION ACRES

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:19.103
BURNED THAT MORE THAN DOUBLED

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.005
OUR LAST RECORD WHICH WAS ONE

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:22.907
POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRES. OF

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:26.711
THAT. BURNED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:27.512
ONLY TO SHORE YEARS AGO. IT IS

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:30.148
BECAUSE- THAT THE STATE THE

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:32.550
ENTIRE STATE IS AT GRAVE FIRE

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.652
RISK AND THIS RISK WILL

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:36.521
CONTINUE TO INCREASE UNLESS WE

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:38.323
COME UP WITH A STRATEGY TO

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:42.393
MITIGATE IT. THE BUDGET ACT OF

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.928
TWENTY TWENTY ALLOCATED A TOTAL

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:47.865
OF TWO HUNDRED AND. THREE POINT

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:48.499
THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIRE.

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:52.103
AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT- THIS

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.939
FIGURE IS IN STARK CONTRAST

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:56.507
WITH THE TWO POINT THREE

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:59.644
BILLION DOLLARS- FOR FIRE

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:02.513
SUPPRESSION AND RESPONSE AND

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.715
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO MAKE

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:04.949
AN ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULD

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:07.251
INVOICE INVEST. LESS IN FIRE

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.354
SUPPRESSION THERE ARE PLENTY OF

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.090
ARGUMENTS WE COULD MAKE TO

00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:16.361
INCREASE OFTEN FOR FIRST. BUT I

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:18.629
DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:20.732
PROPERLY AND ADEQUATELY FUND

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:23.368
FIRE PREVENTION AND FIRE RISK

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:27.939
REDUCTION MEASURES- IN THE-

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:28.439
HOPE THAT WE CAN PROTECT

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:30.308
PROPERTY AND THAT WE CAN

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:32.610
PREVENT FIRES FROM STARTING-

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.412
AND SPREADING. IN THE FIRST

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:37.081
PLACE SO IT'S TIME TO TAKE A

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:38.783
SERIOUS LOOK AT TO HOW WE

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.118
CURRENTLY INVEST IN FIRE

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:42.320
PREVENTION THE GAPS THAT EXIST

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:44.389
IN FUNDING AND WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:46.791
IMPROVE FIRE PREVENTION RISK

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.760
REDUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S

00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:51.095
ALSO TIME THAT WE TREAT OUR

REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:13.544
EMISSIONS- WHICH LEAD TO

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.480

WHICH ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.016
FIRE ISSUES I STRONGLY BELIEVE

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.318
THAT OUR STATE FEDERAL AND

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:21.953
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALSO HAVE TO

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:23.454
EMBRACE FIRE PREVENTION

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:25.289
STRATEGIES THAT ARE MEANINGFUL.

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:26.157
AND MAKE MUCH LARGER

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:27.859
INVESTMENTS TO MAKE OUR BUILT

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:29.060
AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT MORE

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:31.295
RESILIENT TO WILDFIRE USING THE

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:34.198
BEST- AND DEVELOPING SCIENCE.

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:35.733
ONLY THIS WILL REDUCE BOTH THE

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.602
ERROR IMPACT QUALITY IMPACTS

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:39.003
AND THE DEVASTATION THAT THESE

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:42.106
WILDFIRES HAVE BEEN CAUSING

00:35:42.173 --> 00:35:42.874
ACROSS OUR STATE. IF THE STATE

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.041
AND FEDERAL. HAD SPENT AT LEAST

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:45.643
AS MUCH ON FIRE PREVENTION AS

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.911
THEY HAVE ON FIRE SUPPRESSION

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:48.145
OVER THE YEARS I THINK THAT

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:49.113
THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT WE

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.015
WOULDN'T BE IN. NEARLY AS DIRE

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:52.650
SITUATION AS WE ARE TODAY SO I

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:54.018

FACT THAT- THIS HEARING IS

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:13.437
DISTANT FROM MOST OF THE PLACE

00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:15.940
WHERE WE LIVE- I THINK IT

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:18.175
SPEAKS TO THE PRIORITY THAT-

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:19.944
THAT THIS ISSUE HAS. BEEN

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:21.412

CLEARLY SHOWN THAT CLIMATE

00:36:31.822 --> 00:36:33.591
CHANGE IS MAKING OUR WILDFIRES

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:35.526
MORE CATASTROPHIC AND LESS

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:37.862
MANAGEABLE THAN IN PREVIOUS

CUT OUT FOR US. COMING FROM A

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.268
COMMUNITY THAT ALREADY

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:46.103
STRUGGLES WITH POOR AIR QUALITY

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.039
THE INCREASED POLLUTION FROM

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:50.074

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:56.514

LOW BEEN LOCATED. SO YOU SEE

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.696
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE MANY OF

AND MITIGATION CATEGORY THERE

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.100
ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.535
ACTIVITIES. THAT ARE

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:47.504
UNDERTAKEN- PROVIDE A COUPLE OF

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:48.939
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES SPECIFIC TO

PRESCRIBED FIRES- DEFENSIBLE

00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:05.689
SPACE INSPECTIONS AND WE ALSO

TO HELP REVIEW. WELFARE

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:11.228
MEDICATION PLANS FROM THE

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:15.199
UTILITY THIS IS A WIDE RANGE OF

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:17.635
ACTIVITIES. SO IF YOU TURN

00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:20.771
THREE. WHEN WE WHEN WE THINK

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:22.139
ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA SPENDING

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.941
INCREASED OVER RECENT YEARS

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:25.075
WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN THIS GRAPHIC

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:27.144
IS THE BOOK OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.313
BUDGET SO THEIR FIRE PROTECTION

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.482
AND SUPPRESSION OF FUNDING AS

WELL AS A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:37.621
FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING- D.

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:38.956
THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRETY OF

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:40.257
CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET BUT THE

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:42.092
THIS IS THE VAST MAJORITY WHAT

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:44.461
YOU'LL SEE IS THAT OVER THE

00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:45.062
PAST FIFTEEN YEARS TOTAL

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:46.764
SPENDING ON THESE PROGRAMS AND

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.299
INCREASED FROM ABOUT EIGHT

00:42:48.365 --> 00:42:49.867
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:51.201
THOUSAND FIVE SIX. CAN ESTIMATE

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:52.469
OF THREE POINT THREE BILLION

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:54.638
DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:56.273
YEAR THERE COUPLE OF UNDERLYING

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.708
TRENDS THERE SO IF YOU LOOK AT

00:42:57.775 --> 00:42:58.776
THE BASED FIRE PROTECTION

00:42:58.842 --> 00:43:01.078
BUDGET SO THIS IS THE CORE OF

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:04.181
THE DEPARTMENT'S FIREFIGHTER-

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:07.184
STAFF MANAGEMENT AND OTHER

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.586
EQUIPMENT INTO FACILITIES- THAT

00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:12.957
HAS GROWN. STEADILY OVER THAT

00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:13.624
TIME PERIOD. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:15.192
EMERGENCY SUPPRESSION SPENDING

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.927
SO THIS IS WHAT WE THINK OF IT

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:18.896
THE ECONOMY MERGING SEA FIND AS

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:19.964
WELL AS WHATEVER REIMBURSEMENT

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.865
THE ULTIMATELY RECEIVE FROM THE

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:23.233
FEDERAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.402
IF YOU WORK WITH. YOU CAN SEE

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:26.070
THAT THIS VARIES QUITE A BIT

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:28.272
FROM YEAR TO YEAR- CLEARLY IT

00:43:28.339 --> 00:43:29.606
IN RESPONSE TO THE SEVERITY OF

00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:31.842
THAT YEAR'S FIRE SEASON. AND I

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:33.544
THINK CRITICALLY NOTABLE- YOU

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.612
MAY HAVE SEEN THAT LAST WEEK

00:43:35.679 --> 00:43:36.947
THE ADMINISTRATION RELEASED

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:39.049
THEIR REQUIRED QUARTERLY REPORT

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:40.784
FIRST QUARTER REPORT. ON THE E.

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:44.288
FIND WHICH ESTIMATED THAT THE-

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:45.889
THE STATE WOULD BE SPENDING

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:47.057
ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:49.093
DOLLARS FROM EACH FIND. IN THE

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:51.128
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THAT WOULD

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:56.033
BE AN ALL TIME RECORD FOR THAT.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:56.767
LASTLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.268
SHADED AREA. OF THE STATE

00:43:58.335 --> 00:43:59.903
THAT'S- STATE SPENDING ON

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.438
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FIRE

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.307
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. WELL

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:04.508
YOU'LL SEE THERE'S A CORD TO

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:06.110
THINK REALLY ONE THE IT MAKES

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.144
IT A MUCH SMALLER SHARE OF

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.412
TOTAL SPENDING AND IN THE

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:09.947
DEPARTMENT RELATIVE TO FIRE

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:12.116
SUPPRESSION COSTS- BUT I WILL

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:14.618
NOTE THAT IF. YOU'LL SEE AN-

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:16.787
INCREASE IN- THAT SPENDING IN

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:17.988
MORE RECENT YEARS AND THAT

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:20.324
REALLY REFLECTS. THE ADDITION

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.393
OF GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:24.828
FUNDS. FOR THESE PROGRAMS LIKE

00:44:24.895 --> 00:44:26.764
FORCE MANAGEMENT AND PRESCRIBED

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:30.034
FIRES- AND THAT WAS IN IN-

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.969
CONSISTENT WITH SB NINE OH ONE

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:33.704
PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:34.738

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:37.541
FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:39.743
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE SPENDING

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.279
IN FOREST- IN RESOURCE

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.947
MANAGEMENT FIRE PREVENTION DID

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:45.949
DECREASE AGAIN THIS LARGELY

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.718
REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE-

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:49.119
STATE BUDGET DID NOT INCLUDE A

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:51.755
DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURE PLAN.

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:52.556
FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.792
REDUCTION FUND REFLECTING-

00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:56.060
QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:57.561
RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW MUCH

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.512
TO KEEP IN MIND. IN A WAY IN

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:30.814
THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS-

00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:32.282
CERTAINLY ONE SET OF OPTIONS

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:33.050
AND WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT

00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:34.751
GENERAL FUND OR STATE SPECIAL

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.286
FUNDS YOU COULD. LOOK AT

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:37.487
REDIRECTING SOME OF THOSE

00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:38.622
RESOURCES WITH EXISTING

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:41.758
RESOURCES. AND SPENDING MORE ON

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.160
FOREST MANAGEMENT OR FIRE

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:45.162
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES- IT TO

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:45.896
THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:47.497
ACTIVITIES REFLECT A HIGHER

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:51.468
PRIORITY. IN IN THE NEAR TERM-

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.437
YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT NEW TAXES

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:55.339
OR FEES ESTABLISHING THOSE ARE

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:56.773
INCREASING EXISTING TAXES OR

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.842
FEES TO SUPPORT. DIRECTLY

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:01.612
SUPPORT- MITIGATION AND

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.347
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES I JUST AS

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:04.615
AN EXAMPLE WE HAD A FIRE

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:07.251
PREVENTION SHE- PHENOMENON IS

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:09.419
S. ALREADY FEE. AND IN PAST

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:11.822
YEARS- UNDER THE SIMILAR-

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:13.557
APPROACH IN OF COURSE YOU ALSO

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:15.492
CAN LOOK AT GENERAL OBLIGATION

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:17.628
BONDS THEY NOTED PROPOSITION

00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:18.595
SIXTY EIGHT HAVE BEEN USED. TO

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:21.164
PROVIDE SUPPORT MANAGEMENT

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:29.973
RESOURCES. THAT IS. AN OPTION.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:30.774
IF YOU TURN THE PAGE SIX. IN IN

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:32.442
THINK ABOUT. HOW TO. DIFFERENT

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:35.379
OFF DIFFICULT OF KEY. THAT WE

00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:37.447
FIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE FIRST IS

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:39.549
REALLY JUST AROUND. I IDENTIFY.

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:40.417
WHAT THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITY THAT

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:41.918
YOU TO SEE. IF THE NOTE EARLIER

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:43.220
THE ARE WHITE. OF DIFFERENT AT.

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:45.088
THE STATE CAN. TO HELP US

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:46.556
IMPROVE FOREST MANAGEMENT

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:48.425
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES SO WHAT

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:49.860
ARE THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES YOU

00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:51.828
WANT TO TARGET. AND AT WHAT

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:53.230
LEVEL OF HOPE TO FIND HOW MUCH

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:54.097
REVENUE YOU WOULD NEED TO

00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:55.565
GENERATE. AND ALSO THINKING

00:48:55.632 --> 00:48:57.467
ABOUT IS THAT ONE TIME REVENUE

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.269
OR IS THAT AN ONGOING

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:01.038
OPERATIONAL PROGRAM SO THAT

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:02.306
MIGHT SUGGEST FOR EXAMPLE

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:03.206
WHETHER YOU WOULD WANT TO USE A

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:05.242
BOND OR- SOME OTHER ONGOING

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:07.277
REVENUE SOURCE. I'M ONLY WE

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:08.412
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:09.212
REALLY THINK ABOUT WHO SHOULD

00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:11.882
PAY- AND IT COULD BE THAT YOU

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:15.986
HAVE. A COMBINATION OF SOURCES

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:16.586
BUT OFFER UNDER WANT TO THINK

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:18.989
ABOUT WHO THE BAND. OF CERTAIN-

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:21.425
PROGRAM SO INSTEAD CASES WE

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:22.592
THINK ABOUT AND IF THIS YEAR

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:24.428
HAS BEEN A VERY BROAD BASE AND

00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:26.196
THEREFORE PERHAPS. YOU WANT TO

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:28.098
ALIGN YOUR REVENUE SOURCE-

00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:31.335
WITH. A BROADER GROUP OF PAYERS

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:34.271
AND SO- YOU KNOW JUST AS AN

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:35.339
EXAMPLE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.174
WILDFIRES WHILE MUCH OF THE

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.477
IMPACT IS LOCAL WE SAW THIS

00:49:40.544 --> 00:49:41.111
YEAR IN PARTICULAR HOW MUCH OF

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:42.012
THE AIR POLLUTION THE AIR

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.647
IMPACT. WE'RE REALLY STATEWIDE

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:46.983
AND WENT FAR BEYOND JUST THE-

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:53.223
WILL BE OR. THE WILD LAND AREAS.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:53.724
IN OTHER CASES THERE ARE

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.791
BENEFITS. THAT TEND TO BE MUCH

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:56.193
MORE DIRECTLY. BY STATE PROGRAM

00:49:56.259 --> 00:49:57.361
AND THEREFORE MIGHT THERE MIGHT

00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:59.129
BE AN ARGUMENT FOR HAVING THEM

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:02.733
PAY- WE- THINK ABOUT THAT-IN

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:04.701
THE CASE FOR EXAMPLE OF. OUR

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:07.838
OFFICES LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT HOW

00:50:07.904 --> 00:50:09.005
IMPROVE FOREST MANAGEMENT CAN

00:50:09.072 --> 00:50:11.308
HELP- BENEFIT WATER QUALITY

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:12.676
WATER SUPPLIES AND SO IN THAT

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:15.011
SENSE- WATER AGENCIES SOMETIMES

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:17.114
ARE THE BENEFICIARIES. OF GOOD

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.182
FOREST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:20.717
SO YOU COULD THINK ABOUT ARE

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:21.685
THERE ARE WAYS TO GET THEM TO

00:50:21.752 --> 00:50:23.787
CONTRIBUTE. YEAH AND IN FACT WE

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:25.222
KNOW THAT IN SOME CASES SOME

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:27.124
WATER AGENCIES ARE UNDERTAKING

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.125
FORCE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:30.293
THE AREAS AROUND SURROUNDING

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.762
THEIR WATERSHEDS- AND THEN YOU

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:33.230
CAN ALSO SOMETIMES THINK ABOUT

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.197
THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE ARE

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:35.966
THERE CERTAIN. CONTRIBUTORS TO

00:50:36.032 --> 00:50:36.967
THE PROBLEM THEY SHOULD BE

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:39.102
PAYING A GREATER SHARE OF THE

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:41.405
COSTS. IN SO AN EXAMPLE THIS

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.707
MIGHT BE IT IN LOOKING AT

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:45.675
UTILITIES AND HOW YOU. UTILITY

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:47.177
INFRASTRUCTURE HAS CONTRIBUTED

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:49.312
TO FIRES IN PAST YEARS AND I'VE

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:53.750
BEEN IN CERTAIN AREAS- BECAUSE.

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:56.019
OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST.

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.254
LAST POINT ON IS JUST OF COURSE

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.655
AS A BUDGET COMMITTEE YOU'RE

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.056
WELL AWARE THERE NO FREE

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:01.458
LUNCHES THERE'S ONLY TRADE OFF

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:02.659
WITH ANY OPTION THAT YOU LOOK

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.961
AT- SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.430
AT. REDIRECTING EXISTING

00:51:06.496 --> 00:51:08.198
GENERAL FUND A SPECIAL FUND

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:10.333
RESOURCES- THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.668
THAT THERE ARE FEWER RESOURCES

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:15.172
AVAILABLE FOR OTHER BUDGET

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:15.806
PRIORITIES TEXT TO YOU LOOK AT

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:17.974
INCREASING TAXES OR FEES THAT

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:19.376
MAKES SENSE BUT OF COURSE THERE

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:20.977
ARE THEN. CHEAPAIR THE

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.879
TAXPAYERS TO BEAR THOSE COSTS

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:23.847
AND YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.248
THAT FAIR IS THERE AN EQUITABLE

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:27.384
DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE COSTS

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:29.553
AMONG DIFFERENT GROUPS. AND

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:30.754
LASTLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE G. O.

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:34.191
BOND OPTION. AGAIN THAT CAN BE.

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:35.692
VERY APPROPRIATE BUT IT IS A

00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:37.794
ONE TIME REVENUE SOURCE INTO

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:39.262
TECHNICALLY WE RECOMMEND USING

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:41.431
THAT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OTHER

00:51:41.498 --> 00:51:42.966
ONE TIME COSTS NOT FOR ONGOING

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:45.535
OPERATIONS- IN OF COURSE YOU

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:47.103
HAVE TO BE MINDFUL TO THAT. IT

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.439
DOES- THE BOND ARE A FORM OF

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.041
BORROWING AND SO THEN WE DO

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:53.176
HAVE TO PAY THOSE COSTS. AND WE

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:57.147
PAY THEM. WITH INTEREST OVER A

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:59.516
PERIOD OF TIME. SO THAT CONCLU

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:00.951
MY SOME REMARKS HAPPY TO TAKE

00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:04.454
QUESTION YOU MIGHT THANK YOU

00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:06.690
VERY MUCH FOR THE PRIEST. ALL

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:09.359
EXCUSE ME BEGIN A ONE CLASS ONE

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:11.061
OF SOURCE THAT YOU DIDN'T. WAS

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:13.964
THE- IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.432
IT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:19.236
THERE'S A- THERE SHOULD BE AN

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:24.174
TRUST- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:27.310
OF PREVENTING. FIRES AND- IN

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:29.012
PRESERVING RECREATIONAL LAND

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:35.452
RESOURCES- PROTECTING AGAINST-

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.187
THE CARBON THAT'S EMITTED WHEN-

00:52:37.254 --> 00:52:42.192
FOREST BURNS AND THE LIST GOES.

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:43.827
ON AND ON. ARE THERE. I THINK I

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:44.528
KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:45.762
QUESTION THAT ARE ARE THERE ANY

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:48.999
EXISTING- PLACES TO TURN IN

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:50.133
TERMS OF FEDERAL FUNDING OR

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.068
WOULD WE BE STARTING WITH

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:52.936
SCRATCH AND HAVING TO GO TO

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:55.005
CONGRESS AND- ADVOCATE FOR THIS

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:58.141
FROM THE- AS AS NEW FUNDING IF.

00:52:58.208 --> 00:53:00.677
WE WERE TO CHOOSE TO DO SO. YES

00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:02.312
IT IS A GOOD QUESTION- AND

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:03.647
CERTAINLY NO IN CALIFORNIA THE

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:05.849
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNS. THE

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:08.518
MAJORITY OF. THE WILDLAND AREAS

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:09.853
AND SO THEY CERTAINLY. HAVE

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.121
THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:12.722
MANAGE THOSE LANDS. AND THEY

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:15.258
PROVIDE SOME FUNDING TO DO SO

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:16.726
BUT JUST ON THEIR LAND. THERE

00:53:16.793 --> 00:53:18.128
IS NOT MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING

00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:21.998
THAT IS PROVIDED TO STATE. FOR

00:53:22.065 --> 00:53:23.633
PREVENTION AND MITIGATION

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.503
ACTIVITIES- CERTAINLY ON A FOR

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:29.606
EXAMPLE S. ARE ALIENS. DATE THE

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:30.707
ONE EXCEPTION I CAN THINK OF

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.242
IS. WE SOMETIMES READ FEDERAL

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:35.111
RECEIVE FEDERAL MEDICATION.

00:53:35.178 --> 00:53:36.246
RIGHT ARE USUALLY IN THE

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:37.781
AFTERMATH OF THE DISASTER THE

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:38.715
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:41.384
PROVIDE. FUNDING IN THE STATE

00:53:41.451 --> 00:53:43.386
HAS SOME FLEXIBILITY HOW TO USE

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:43.987
THAT FUNDING SO IT COULD BE IF

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:46.323
TO. HELP IMPLEMENT PROJECTS

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:47.524
THAT WOULD MITIGATE DISASTER

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:48.959
BUT THATCOULD BE USED FOR

00:53:49.025 --> 00:53:49.826
WILDFIRE MITIGATION FLOOD

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.995
MITIGATION OTHER TYPES OF

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:55.432
ACTIVITIES WHILE. AND SO WE AYE

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:56.499
I SHOULD KNOW SO WEAK YEAH IN

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:57.767
IN LIGHT OF THE DISASTERS THIS

00:53:57.834 --> 00:53:59.936
YEAR WE PROBABLY EXPECT TO SEE

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:01.605
SIGNIFICANT MITIGATION FUNDS

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:02.372
ARE COMING FROM THE FEDERAL

00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:04.240
GOVERNMENT AND- OVER THE NEXT

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:06.610
FEW YEARS. AND SO ONE THING YOU

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:07.510
MIGHT THINK ABOUT WE'VE

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:09.145
RECOMMENDED THIS IN THE PAST IS

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:11.081
THAT- WHERE IS YES TEND TO

00:54:11.147 --> 00:54:12.482
HAVE. A FAIR AMOUNT OF

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:13.383
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THAT MONEY

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:14.818
IS ALLOCATED THAT COULD BE AN

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:17.087
AREA WITH THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:54:17.153 --> 00:54:18.388
GET MORE ENGAGED. AND PROVIDE

00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:20.890
SOME GUIDANCE ON WHAT YOU THINK

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:21.458
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MONEY

00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:24.327
SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED. THAT'S

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:26.963
INTERESTING. ALL RIGHT WELL

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.864
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.748
THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:46.249
FIRE SUPPRESSION AND FIRE

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:47.784

WITH COVERT AND THE COSTS

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:04.768
RELATED TO COVERT WHAT NEW

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:07.037
REVENUE SOURCES SHOULD THE

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:09.372
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER TO ADDRESS

00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:14.411
THE GAP. YEAH AND THAT WAS I

THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:16.279
QUESTION I MEAN WE CERTAINLY

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:17.380
SEEN WITH THIS IS VERY OF THE

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:20.550
FIRE SEASON THIS YEAR. THAT

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:23.186
THERE'S PROBABLY MORE- MORE

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:24.721
ACTIVE YOU NEED THAT COULD BE

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:26.623
DONE TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES

AND OUR COMMITTEE SAFER AND

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:30.160
THAT THE FORCE HEALTHIER WE

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:30.994
DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:32.262
RECOMMENDATION ON WHAT THE

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:34.998
RIGHT REVENUE SOURCE IS- BUT

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:36.199
YOU COULD THINK FOR EXAMPLE

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:38.468
ABOUT TO THE EXTENT THAT. IT

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:38.968
MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE BIT

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:40.937
DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHAT

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:42.939
SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES THAT YOU-

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:46.643

AND THEM L. THAT MY THERE THERE

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:56.553
MIGHT BE REVENUE. YOU WANT TO

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:58.054
USE THEIR IF YOU TO FOR THE-

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:00.457
LOOK AT- THAT ACTIVITIES

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:01.958
SPECIFICALLY TO PROTECT

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:05.562
HOMEOWNER WITHIN THE S. ALREADY

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:08.264
THE STATE HAD THE FIBER FEE IN

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:10.567
THE PAST THAT- THE INTENT THERE

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:12.869
WAS TO. ENSURE THAT THE

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.337
PROPERTY OWNERS WITHIN THOSE

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:16.439
AREAS WERE PAYING A FEE TO HELP

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:18.641
WHICH THEN AT THE END AND THAT

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:22.011
FEAR COULD BE TO PROTECT THOSE

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:23.446
TO. AND SO I THERE WAS A

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:25.682
BENEFIT. PAYS KIND OF PRINCE

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:26.950

REVENUE SOURCES DEPENDING ON

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:35.091
THE- ACTIVE ONE OF. I THINK THE

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:36.893
ONLY A POINT I'D ADD BECAUSE

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.628

CAN USE TO FUND TO SUPPORT

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.471
OTHER ACTIVE WERE THERE MIGHT

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:52.842

ALPHABET FROM CAP AND TRADE AND

CAP AND TRADE HASN'T BEEN

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.862
PRODUCING MUCH REVENUE HAVE WE

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:46.763
BEEN ABLE TO UP WITH THE

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:48.064
FUNDING OF WAS ONE THE S. R.

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:53.803
AMFI. YES SO ESTERASE CHEN. I

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.271

PROGRAM TO TWENTY THIRTY. THE

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:08.585
ACCELERATION E. Y. A LIMON.

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:09.719
WITH THE PROVISION THAT CAPS

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:11.120
TRADE A RATHER WOULD BE YOU TO

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:16.159
BACK FILL. THE REDUCED FEVER.

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:17.026
AND YES SO THE WAY THE PRO IS

00:58:17.093 --> 00:58:20.230
STRUCK CURRENT THE X. PROGRAM

FOR CAP AND TRADE. IS THAT S.

COME OFF THE IN SOME WAYS

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:28.204
SIMILAR. THE CONTINUOUS

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:28.771
APPROPRIATION THAT WE HAVE

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:31.808
WHERE THE SORT OF AT THE VERY

00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:35.712
BACK ALSO GETS FOR PRIOR. IN SO

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:36.746
AT THAT IS CONTINUE TO BE FINE

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:39.716
IN THE- EXPENDITURE PLAN. EVEN

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:48.825
THE LEAN. THAT WE TO A YEAR SO.

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:51.861
THE FORTY TO FIFTY MILLION WAS

00:58:51.928 --> 00:59:03.573
A TO BE. FOR AND THEN IN THE

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.710
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR- D. FIRST

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:09.746
QUARTER AUCTION THAT WE HAD WAS

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:11.114
BETTER THAN IT MAY NOT QUITE

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.515
THE SAME LEVEL THIS PAST YEAR

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:13.783
SO WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW THAT

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:15.852
NEXT THREE OPTIONS DO. BEFORE

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:16.819
WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH

00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:18.988
REVENUES OF AVAILABLE FOR ALL

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:20.390
THE PROGRAM BUT AGAIN BECAUSE

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:22.191
THAT THAT'S ALREADY BACK STILL

00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:23.927
ESSENTIALLY COMES OFF THE TOP

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:26.663
IT'S GIVEN FIRST PRIORITY- YOU

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.164

00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:31.701
BE. IT'LL BE FULLY FUNDED HI HI

00:59:31.768 --> 00:59:34.971
MS RIVAS. THANK YOU. YOU'VE

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:36.739
ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSING MY-

00:59:36.806 --> 00:59:38.308
CONCERN WHICH IS THE

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:41.511
UNCERTAINTY. OF THE G. G. R. F.

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:44.447
AND HOW. YOU KNOW MOST OF THE-

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.349
FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.251
MANAGEMENT. I'M FUNDING IS

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.986
COMING FROM THE AUCTION

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:52.855
PROCEEDS AND IF- YOU KNOW NEXT

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:54.958
YEAR THERE ARE A LOT LOWER LIKE

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:58.127
THEY HAVE BEEN. OF WHAT HOW DO

00:59:58.194 --> 00:59:59.996
YOU ANTICIPATE. BOB THAT WILL

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.498
BE ABLE TO FIND THE FIRE I MEAN

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:04.500
THE FOR PREVENTION AND

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:07.603
MANAGEMENT OF THE FORESTS.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.073
RIGHT SO IN PARTICULAR WAS NOT

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:12.442
BEING FUNDED RIGHT NOW ARE THE

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:13.409
FORCE MANAGEMENT FIRE

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:15.611
PREVENTION GRANTS OF THE STATE-

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:18.514
THE- THE BUDGET DID ALLOCATE

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.750
SOME GINGER A FUNDING. FOR ITS

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:21.751
STATE STAFF SO THAT WOULD

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:22.752
INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:25.421
PRESCRIBED FIRE CREWS THE

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:25.989
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:28.591
THAT WAS- THERE IS SORT OF

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:30.360
ASSOCIATED WITH SB NINE UP ONE

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:33.596
BUT- YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS OUR

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.498
SUBSEQUENT AUCTIONS BRING IN

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:36.933
RELATIVELY LITTLE REVENUE.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.368
THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:41.004
FULLY FIND ALL OF THE PROGRAMS

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.205
THAT WE HISTORICALLY FUNDED

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:44.841
INCLUDING THE- FORCE MANAGEMENT

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:46.976
FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS- IF

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.845
THAT'S THE CASE THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:51.881
THAT A COUPLE OF OPTIONS- BUT I

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:54.217
THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT- SO

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:57.286
ONE OPTION IS TO- CENTER THAT

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:58.321
WHATEVER REVENUE COMES AND

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.890
GOING TO THE FOR THE FIND. YOU

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.558
MAY NOT HAVE IT IN THAT CASE

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.327
YOU MIGHT SIMPLY NOT HAVE A

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.162
DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURE PLAN

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:07.196
IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT WOULD

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:08.865
MEAN THE END OF THOSE FUNDS ARE

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.666
GRANTED OUR ARCH THOSE GRANTS

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:12.135
ARE NOT FUNDED THIS YEAR BUT

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:13.436
THAT MIGHT MEAN THE MONIES.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.371
AVAILABLE TO CUMULATE IN SPEND

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:17.407
NEXT YEAR THE OTHER OPTION NOW

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:20.676
IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:21.277
WANT TO PASS A DISCRETIONARY.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.580
PLAY IN FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.783

CERTAINLY YOU COULD YOU COULD

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.154
CERTAINLY DO THAT BUT IF YOU

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.822
HAVE LESS REVENUE TOTALED IN

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.323
WHAT YOU'VE HAD IN THE PAST

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.258
ULTIMATELY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.226
TO MAKE SOME. CHOICES ABOUT

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:39.062
WHAT EUROPE WHAT TO PRIORITIZE

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:40.530
AND IF THAT IS THE FORCE

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:42.265
MANAGEMENT GRANTS THAT MEANS

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:43.032
OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'VE

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.767

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:57.173
CONSERVATION SCIENTISTS WITH

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.074
THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT

01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:01.978
SOCIETY ALSO KNOWN AS SI NPS.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:03.246
I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:03.880
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.215
WILDFIRE NATIVE PLANTS AND

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.984
CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW THOSE

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:10.419
RELATIONSHIPS CAN AND INDEED

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:12.388
SHOULD INFORM THE WAY WE MANAGE

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.124
WILDFIRE GOING FORWARD. BEFORE

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.193
I GET STARTED ON MY TESTIMONY.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.128
AT THE NATIVE CALIFORNIAN AND

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:21.063
ALLOWING A LIFELONG RESIDENT I

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.565
WANT TO SAY THAT I SINCERELY

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:25.101
FEEL FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:25.635
HAVE SUFFERED FROM RECENT

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.670
WILDFIRES. MY FRIENDS ARE AMONG

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:31.073
THOSE VICTIMS. I ALSO FEEL FOR

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.308
THE PURCHASE PONDERED FROM CAL

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:34.377
FIRE THE FOREST SERVICE AND LAW

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.511
ENFORCEMENT WHO RISKED THEIR

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.046
LIVES TO PROTECT PEOPLE

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:38.648
PROPERTY AND ECOLOGICAL

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:41.951
RESOURCES. IS THESE FOLKS WHO

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:43.286
ARE INHERITING A NEARLY

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:45.421
IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. DRIVEN BY

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.156
SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT I WILL

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:49.559
ATTEMPT TO DISCUSS TODAY. THESE

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.294
FACTORS INCLUDE LAND

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.329
MISMANAGEMENT CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:56.532
AND POOR PLANNING DECISIONS. I

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:57.400
HOPE TO PRESENT A BALANCED

01:03:57.466 --> 01:04:00.303
PERSPECTIVE ON THE CAUSES OF

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.904
AND SOLUTIONS TO THE CRISIS

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.139
WITHOUT DIMINISHING THE EFFORTS

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:05.308
OF THESE DEDICATED WORKERS AND

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:07.243
THE COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:10.947
READING FROM WHAT. MY

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:13.616
ORGANIZATION ST PS IS A SCIENCE

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.219
BASED FIVE ONE C. THREE

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.187
NONPROFIT WHOSE MISSION. IS

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:20.022
PRODUCTION OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:22.491
NATIVE PLANTS AND HABITATS.

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:25.061
WATER ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARILY

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:27.563
A THREAT TO NATIVE PLANTS. IS A

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:28.598
PART OF THEIR NOT HAVE THEIR

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:32.134
ECOLOGY AND NATIVE PLANTS HAVE

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.203
LARGELY INVOLVED WITH FIRE. BUT

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.238
DUE TO A NUMBER OF COMPLEX

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:37.306
FACTORS WE FIND OURSELVES OUT

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:42.011
OF BALANCE TODAY. NOW I HAVE

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.012
BEEN STUDYING THE FLORA AND

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.647
HABITATS OF CALIFORNIA FOR MORE

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:47.416
THAN TWO DECADES. GOING WAY

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.085
BACK MY FIRST JOB AS A BOTANIST

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:50.920
WAS DISTINCTLY TIED TO FIRE IN

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:53.856
THE SIERRA NEVADA. AS A COLLEGE

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:55.725
STUDENT I SPENT FOUR GLORIOUS

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.059
SUMMERS WORKING ON HOW NATIONAL

01:04:57.126 --> 01:05:01.364
FOREST. ADD TO THAT LOOKING TO

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:04.100
THE WEST OF LAKE TAHOE. I DON'T

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.135
HAVE THIS PERSPECTIVE BACK THEN

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:07.069
BUT I NOW REALIZE THAT NEARLY

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:08.271
EVERY PROJECT I WORKED ON

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:09.505
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD WAS

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.507
DIRECTLY TIED TO WILDFIRE AND

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.175
TO SOME DEGREE OUR LEGACY OF

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.877
MISMANAGEMENT IN SOME OF THOSE

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:17.280
FOREST HABITATS ALSO TO. TIED

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.849
TO FIRE SUPPRESSION. MUCH OF

01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:21.651
THE SUMMERS I SPENT. BUT I

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:22.785
WOULD SERVING FOR RARE PLANTS

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:24.787
IN AREAS THAT HAD BEEN BURNED

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.455
IN PREVIOUS YEARS BY WILDFIRES.

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.224
PRIOR TO SALVAGE LOGGING

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:31.060
OPERATIONS. ALSO SPENT HUNDREDS

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.461
OF HOURS PULLING AN INVASIVE

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:34.130
SPECIES CALLED MUSK THISTLE ON

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:35.398
BOCA HILL WHICH IS LOCATED TO

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:37.800
THAT JUST IT JUST TO THAT I

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:39.835
GUESS SO TO THE NORTH OF

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:42.171
TRUCKEE. ALL RIGHT MUST THIS OF

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:45.308
THIS NASTY INVASIVE PLANT THAT

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.510
IS THE- AND YOU KNOW TOUGH TO

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:50.212
DEAL WITH. AND THAT PLANT WAS

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:52.081
ACTUALLY INTRODUCED TO THE AREA

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:54.150
ON FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT THAT

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:55.751
WAS YOU KNOW IT THAT WAS A YOU

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.086
KNOW OF COURSE NECESSARY TO

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:58.120
FIGHT A FIRE IN THE AREA BUT

01:05:58.187 --> 01:06:00.256
WAS IS DIRECTLY TIED TO FIRE AS

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:04.160
WELL. I THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:05.561
BACK TO THAT TIME PERIOD OR

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:07.229
LIKE ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:09.065
BACK THEN WE THOUGHT IT TWENTY

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:10.900
THOUSAND ACRE FIRE WAS HUGE.

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.635
AND OUR FIRE OF THAT SIZE WOULD

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.503
BARELY EVEN MAKE THE NEWS.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.273
TODAY I WOULD CONSERVATION

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.508
ADVOCACY FOR SI NPS AND HOPE

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.010
OKAY EITHER WE CONCERT CONSERVE

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:22.545
WHAT IS LEFT OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:23.579
IRREPLACEABLE SPECIES AND

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.449
HABITATS. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.451
RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER ON

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:30.319
CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY.

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:31.520
ALL PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:32.621
FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:34.757
THE WORLD'S THIRTY SIX BUT

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:38.027
GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS.

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:39.628
APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF OUR

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:40.963
FLOOR IS FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.666
THE WORLD. AND SIMILARLY LARGE

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:44.767
PERCENTAGES OF THE STATE'S

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.303
PLANT A RARE WITH MANY OF THE

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:47.870
SPECIES BEING PUSHED TOWARDS

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:51.841
EXTINCTION. NEARLY ALL THE

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:53.609
SPECIES BOTH COMMON AND RARE.

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.845
HAVE EVOLVED AND HABITATS THAT

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:59.715
ARE AFFECTED BY WILDFIRE. STEVE

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:00.950
REFERRED TO GATHER AND FOR

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:03.119
PATCHES OF VEGETATION OR YOU

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.553
CAN CALL IT MORE CULT MORE

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.722
SIMPLY HABITATS. EACH OF THESE

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:09.892
HABITATS HAVE THEIR THEIR OWN

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:12.828
UNIQUE RESPONSE TO FIRE. AND SO

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:13.829
IT'S WITH THAT FRAMEWORK IN

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:15.798
MIND THAT I SEE THE BIGGEST

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.466
RISK WE SEE IS THAT THERE'S A

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.635
BIT OF AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.302
THE CAUSES OF OUR WELFARE

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:22.605
CRISIS. AND ITS POTENTIAL

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:26.375
SOLUTIONS. IN THE MEDIA YOU

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:28.377
OFTEN HEAR THAT THE CALLS A

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:29.412
WILDFIRE CRISIS IS EITHER

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.180
FORCED MISMANAGEMENT FOR

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:34.984
CLIMATE CHANGE. SOLUTIONS WE

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.452
HEAR A LOT ABOUT INCLUDE FOREST

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:38.754
AND FUEL MANAGEMENT. AND

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:41.257
ACTIVITIES IT AND REALLY IT'S

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.125
MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.060
IN CALIFORNIA THERE REALLY IS

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:48.464
NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION.

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:49.732
I THINK THAT IN SOME REGARD WE

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:50.966
SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TALKING

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:52.835
ABOUT ONE HABITAT HABITAT TYPES

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.103
WHICH ARE WHICH ARE FOR THESE

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:56.305
FORESTS. AND REALLY NOT ENOUGH

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:57.873
TIME TALKING ABOUT PLACES WHERE

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.475
SO MANY OF OUR FIRES IN

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:03.345
COMMUNITIES OF KIRK WOODLANDS

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:05.548
GRASSLAND AND CHAPARRAL. LIKE

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:06.949
THE PEOPLE THAT INHABIT THIS

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:09.718
GREAT STATE. CALIFORNIANSHAVE

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:10.753
HAD A REMARKABLY DIVERSE AND

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.522
COMPLEX IN OUR APPROACHES THE

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:18.127
WILDFIRE SHOULD BE THE SAME. IN

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:19.395
THE REST OF MY TESTIMONY I'M

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:20.930
GOING TO TALK THREE THREE OF

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:21.764
OUR MOST COMMON VEGETATION

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:24.166
TYPES FOREST CHAPARRAL AND

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:27.870
GRASSLANDS. CHANCES ARE THAT

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.338
EACH OF YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:30.172
OF THESE HABITATS TYPES IN YOUR

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.041
DISTRICT. SOME YOU PROBABLY

01:08:32.107 --> 01:08:35.244
HAVE ALL THREE. ALL COMPARE AND

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:37.613
CONTRAST HOW YOU TO THESE

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.081
HABITATS ARE AFFECT BY WHAT.

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.149
AND HELP PLENTY CALLED YOU CAN

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:41.684
INFORM THEIR ASSOCIATED

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:45.488
MANAGEMENT. NEXT I'LL SHARE

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:46.922
WHAT WE DO AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:47.823
THE NEXUS BETWEEN CLIMATE

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:52.495
CHANGE WILDFIRE IMPLANTS. LAST

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:54.063
I WILL DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:56.031
ABOUT HOW ECOLOGY CAN AND

01:08:56.098 --> 01:08:57.600
SHOULD INFORM ACTIONS

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.869
ESPECIALLY THOSE NON FORESTED

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:03.906
REGIONS AND HABITATS. OTHER

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:04.740
TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.976
ALREADY. THE STORY OF WILDFIRE

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.611
IN CALIFORNIA IS INEXTRICABLY

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:10.846
LINKED TO NATIVE TO THE NEED A

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:14.083
FLOOR OF OUR STATE. HOW FIRE

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.951
BEHAVES ON THE LANDSCAPE. IS A

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:18.153
COMBINATION OF THE RESPONSES OF

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.288
THOSE PLANS IN CONJUNCTION

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:21.423
WITH. OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.158
LAND MANAGEMENT WEATHER

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:26.762
PATTERNS AND CLIMATE. WITH THAT

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:27.363
IN MIND I THINK WE NEED TO ASK

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:31.800
SOME QUESTIONS. WHAT DOES

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.402
VEGETATION CUT WHAT'S WHAT IS

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:34.537
THE TYPE OF VEGETATION IN A

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:35.638
GIVEN AREA TELLS ABOUT THE

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:37.706
FIERY GENES AND ASSOCIATED

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:41.010
RISKS. AND SECOND WHAT DO

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:43.112
HABITAT TYPES TELL US ABOUT HOW

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:43.646
WE SHOULD MANAGE FOR THESE

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:46.615
RISKS. TO GET SOME OF THESE

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.017
QUESTIONS I THINK LET'S START

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:49.051
WITH LOOKING AT THE FOURTH AND

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.719
I'LL FOCUS ON KIND OF THE MID

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.788
ELEVATION PART OF HER FOR ITS

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:55.758
THIS HERE IN ABOUT A. MANY

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:57.226
FORESTED AREAS. ESPECIALLY

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:58.661
THOSE AT MID ELEVATION HAVE

01:09:58.727 --> 01:09:59.929
EXPERIENCE A DEFICIENCY OF

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:03.132
WILDFIRES. AND THAT THEY WANT

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:05.100
TO BIRD AT A GREATER FREQUENCY.

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:06.468
THIS IS IN PART DUE TO CENTURY

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.770
OR MORE BUT A CENTURY OR MORE

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:09.572
OF FIRE SUPPRESSION WHICH IS

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:10.806
LED TO MAKING MILITIA FINE

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.108
FUELS AND DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.877
UNDERSTOREY. I MEAN IF YOU'VE

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.645
DRIVEN UP INTO THE SIERRA

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:17.479
NEVADA RECENTLY MY TO SEEN

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:19.582
HABITATS THAT ARE. SO THICK

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:22.851
WITH SMALL TREES THAT YOU CAN

01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:23.485
YOU CAN BARELY EVEN SEE THROUGH

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.588
THEM. AND THIS IS A BIT MORE

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:26.655
YOU KNOW A BIT OR A LOT MORE

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:28.257
DENSE. THAN WE WOULD HAVE

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.326
OBSERVED. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:33.862
CENTURY AGO. NOW WHEN FIRES

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:36.031
OCCUR IN THESE HABITATS- ONE

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:37.166
TERM THAT IS USED TO DESCRIBE

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:40.102
THOSE THOSE THAT DENSE GROWTH

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:41.637
OF UNDERSTOREY IS LADDER FUELS.

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:42.972
AND THAT THOSE FUELS CAN CARRY

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:44.807
THE FIRE INTO THE CANOPY

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.308
RESULTING IN SEVERE FIRE

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:47.109
CONDITIONS AND HIGH TREE

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:49.778
MORTALITY WHICH IS NOT

01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:50.412
SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO SEE

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:52.715
THAT NECESSARILY. THESE FIRES

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:54.049
ARE ALSO A KOREAN SWAPS THAT

01:10:54.116 --> 01:10:56.318
ARE SO LARGE AND WITH SUCH

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:58.120
RAPID HIGH SEVERITY. THAT

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:00.456
RECOVERY OF SOME AREAS IS

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:02.725
QUESTIONABLE. BUT HEREIN LIES

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:05.327
THE PARADOX. WITH THAT WE NEED

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:06.862
MORE FIRE IN THESE AREAS BUT

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:09.298
NOT IN THE FIRE THAT FIRE THAT

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:12.835
IS OF THE RIGHT KIND. FORSETT

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.603
HABITATS- PLACE WHERE THERE IS

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:17.039
ROOM ISN'T A ROOM FOR. SOME YOU

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:20.409
KNOW ACTUALLY A GREAT DEAL OF

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:21.377
OPTIMISM I WOULD SAY. IF WE

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:23.045
CHOOSE TO LISTEN TO SCIENTISTS.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.514
AND OTHER GROUPS SUCH AS NATIVE

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:26.215
AMERICANS WHO HAVE A HAVE

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:27.483
MALENY OF LAND MANAGEMENT

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:29.351
EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.186
ENABLE THAT KNOWLEDGE INPUT

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:32.388
ACTIONS THAT ARE BOTH

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.055
BENEFICIAL TO BOTH TO THE

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.757
HABITAT. AND PROTECTIVE OF

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.392
HUMAN COMMUNITIES. THESE

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.494
INCLUDE THINGS ACTIONS LIKE

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.095
PRESCRIBED TO MANAGE WILDFIRE.

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:41.597
AND HE CULTURALLY ECOLOGICALLY

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:45.067
INFORMED THING. WE CAN HAVE A

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.336
WIN WIN SITUATION. MOVING ON

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:48.871
FROM FOREST LET'S TALK A LITTLE

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:50.406
BIT OF TROUBLE ENTERS THOSE

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:55.210
HABITATS LIKE- LIKE CHAPARRAL.

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:58.247
DOMINATED BY SHRUBS. SOMETIMES

01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:01.717
KNOWN AS AS CHAPARRAL IN SOME

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:02.885
PLACES COASTAL SAGE IT OTHERS

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.486
ARE ARE THOSE ARE HABITATS THAT

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:06.855
YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD OF. THE

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.691
CURRENT MANY PLACES STATEWIDE

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:10.059
BUT ESPECIALLY PROMINENT ALONG

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:12.795
THE COAST AND IN LOWER

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:13.262
ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHERN

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:14.763
CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE ALSO

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.999
EXTENSIVE AREAS OF THESE TYPES

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:17.633
OF HABITATS IN THE FOOTHILLS OF

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.669
THE SIERRA NEVADA. FIRE PLAYS A

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:23.405
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:23.906
MAINTENANCE OF CHAPARRAL

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:26.275
HABITATS. JUST LIKE IN THE

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:28.477
FORCE OF THE SIERRA NEVADA.

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:29.611
THESE HOW DOES ABSOLUTELY NEED

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.814
FIRE AT THE RIGHT INTO INTERVAL

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.182
FOR THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE.

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:37.519
BUT IN MARCH CONTRAST TO THE

01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:39.221
FOREST OF THE SIERRA NEVADA

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.589
SOME OF OUR CHAPARRAL HABITAT

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:42.257
HAS EXPERIENCE FIRE AT TOO

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:45.327
FREQUENT INTERVAL ESPECIALLY IN

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:48.097
AREAS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:49.264
SOME OF THESE ARE SOME OTHER

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:51.366
PLACES HAVE EXPERIENCE FIRE AT

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:52.935
WHAT WE CENTER THE PRETTY MUCH

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:53.969
THE NORMAL FIRE RETURN

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:56.071
INTERVALS. SO MORE FIRE THESE

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:58.207
TYPES OF HABITATS IS NOT

01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:00.375
NECESSARILY A GOOD THING AT ALL.

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:02.444
AND EVEN MORE SO. HIRES A BIRD

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:03.779
TO FREQUENTLY OF THESE HABITATS

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:06.315
CAN HAVE DRASTIC ECOLOGICAL

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:08.884
CONSEQUENCES. ALTHOUGH MANY

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:11.353
SHRUBS GROW BACK OR RE SEED

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.522
AFTER WILDFIRE. THEY NEED TIME

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:17.359
TO DO SO. AND IF FIRE RETURNS

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:19.161
TO QUICKLY TO THESE HABITATS.

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.963
INVASIVE PLANTS LIKE AN ORANGE

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:23.065
LIKE NON NATIVE ANNUAL GRASSES

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:26.001
CAN TAKE OVER. AND IT CAN LEAD

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:26.902
TO SOMETHING THAT WE CALL TYPE

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:30.005
CONVERSIONAND WHICH LEAVES-

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.373
YOU KNOW WHICH ELIMINATES A

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.209
NATIVE HABITAT AS WELL AS

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:35.644
LEADING THAT HAPPENED AT THE

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:37.045
HABITAT THAT IS DOMINATED BY

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:38.914
NON NATIVE PLANTS EVEN MORE

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:42.251
VULNERABLE TO. SUBSEQUENT

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:44.820
WILDFIRES. FOR THAT REASON WE

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:46.688
NEED TO REDUCE FIRE AND

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:48.190
DISTURBANCE IN TRUCK DOMINATED

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.291
HABITATS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.794
THESE HABITS ARE ALREADYUNFORTUNATELY BURNING AT

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.162
PROBABLY THE RIGHT INTERVAL OR

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:55.230
ALREADY TO FOR AT TO FREQUENT

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:57.833
INTERVAL. THAT MEANS.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.501
PRESCRIBED FIRE THESE TYPE OF

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:00.302
HABITAT IS NOT SUCH A GOOD

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.237
THING. AND SO WAS SOME OF THE

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:04.540
DISTURBANCE MECHANISM SUCH AS

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:07.843
LIKE MASTICATION- AND YOU KNOW

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.212
THINGS LIKE. ACCIDENTAL FIRES

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.681
THAT ARE SET BY HUMANS WOULD

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:16.752
NEED TO BE REDUCED AS WELL. FOR

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:17.820
THE CURRENT THESE TYPES OF

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:18.987
HABITATS THAT ARE OCCURRING YOU

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.689
KNOW IT'S JASON TO WORK RIGHT

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:21.256
IN THE MIDDLE OF CHAPARRAL

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:23.959
HABITATS. WE REALLY NEED TO

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.994
FOCUS ON HOLD A COMMUNITY HARD

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:27.129
HOME HARDENING A COMMUNITY

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.131
PREPAREDNESS THINGS LIKE MAKING

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:30.465
SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:33.001
DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND KNOW HOW

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:34.469
TO EVACUATED AND WE'RE TO

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.171
EVACUATE TO WHEN IT WENT

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:37.873
ESSENTIALLY THE WHAT IS AN

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:42.377
EVENTUAL WILDFIRE. CHERSON MINT

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:44.379
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:47.316
THERE'S A SOME PRETTY. MARKET

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:48.417
BECAUSE- BETWEEN THOSE TWO

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:50.886
HABITATS THE FORCES HERE TO

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:53.322
VOTE AND CHAPARRAL THERE IS TO

01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:55.290
IT AND WHAT WE MIGHT PRESCRIBE

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:57.693
FOR ONE AREA IS NOT PRESCRIBED

01:14:57.759 --> 01:15:01.396
WELL TO ANOTHER. FINALLY LET'S

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:01.897
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.532
GRASSLANDS AND MUSING GRASSLAND

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:05.834
IN A VERY LIBERAL SENSE- IT'S A

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.069
TERM THAT ENCOMPASSES A WIDE TO

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:08.203
HAVE WIDE RANGE OF HABITATS

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.872
FROM. YOU KNOW WHAT WE YOU KNOW

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.773
THOSE WILDFLOWER SUPER BLOOMS

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.442
THAT EVERYBODY GOES TO VISIT

01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:15.611
WITH A IN A GOOD RAIN YEAR. TED

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:17.880
NATIVE PERENNIAL GRASSLAND. AND

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:19.381
IT TOO VERNAL POOLS EPHEMERAL

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:21.283
WETLANDS THAT ARE AMAZINGLY

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:24.987
FILLED WITH TONS OF RARE.

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:26.221
PLANTS AND ANIMALS. AND THE

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:26.955
OTHER OFFER INTERSPERSED WITH

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:29.191
OTHER. THEY CAN BE ADDRESSING

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:32.394
THE CHOPPER. OR IT TO. OR INTO

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:35.130
A LOT OF GRASS OCCURS I DO THE

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:38.734
AND WHAT. MUCH LIKE THE REST OF

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.003
OUR OF OUR FLORIDA MANY OR MOST

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:43.005
OF OUR GRASS AND PLANTS. HAVE

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:45.107
ALSO EVOLVED WITH FIRE. YEAH

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:48.277
BUT WE N THE PAST THESE BARS

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:49.645
WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY LOW YOU

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:51.380
KNOW LOW TO MODERATE INTENSITY

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:51.947
BECAUSE THEY WOULD'VE BEEN

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.015
SMALLER AMOUNTS OF FUEL

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:56.018
TYPICALLY IF ALL THESE PLANTS

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:58.587
IT WAS ONLY NATIVE PLANTS. BUT

01:15:58.654 --> 01:15:59.655
UNFORTUNATELY MUCH OF OUR

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.056
NATIVE DOMINATED GRASSLAND

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:01.957
HABITATS AND EITHER BEEN

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:04.626
DEVELOPED. ORIGIN CONVERTED

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:06.295
INTO AGRICULTURE. AND WHAT

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:09.231
REMAINS IS OFTEN A MIX OF A

01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:09.831
NATIVE SPECIES AND NON NATIVE

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:13.168
GRASSES. ALL TOO OFTEN THESE

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.503
NON NATIVE GRASSES OCCURRING

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:16.872
HUGE QUANTITIES AND ACTIVISTS

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:18.340
WATCHING YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:19.741
FLASHY FUELS TRIGGERING

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.677
DESTRUCTIVE AND FAST MOVING

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:26.581
WILDFIRES. TRAGICALLY ALSO A

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:27.883
NUMBER OF OUR GRASSLAND AND

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.451
WOODLAND HABITATS HAVE BEEN TO

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.186
HAVE BEEN- REGARDLESS OF THEIR

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.789
ECOLOGICAL VALUE. AND MANY OF

01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:34.389
THEM HAVE VERY HIGH ECOLOGICAL

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:35.891
VALUE. HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR

DEVELOPMENT AND ARE LOCATED

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.062
WITHIN THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:41.630
CLASSIFIED AS HIGH FIRE VERY

HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SO MY

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:44.967
ORGANIZATION HAS WORKED ON.

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:46.601
ADVOCACY RELATED TO A NUMBER OF

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.437
A LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:50.138
RECENT YEARS THAT EIGHT THAT

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:51.273
ARE OCCURRING GRASSLAND

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.741
HABITATS AND WOULD WOULD HAVE

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:55.844
ATTACKED THAT ARE YOU KNOW ALSO

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:57.312
IN VERY HIGH RISK HIGH RISK

HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES. MORE

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:11.893
RECENTLY WE WORKED ON A PROJECT

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.228
CALLED ONE OF VALLEY AT LAKE

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:16.431
COUNTY. THAT IS DESIGNATED AS

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:17.599
HIGH VERY HIGH VERY HIGH OR

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.935
SEVERITIES OF. AND IT WAS

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:22.604
APPROVED IN JULY AND NOT LESS

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:23.905
THAN A MONTH LATER IN THE ALLEN

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:26.008
YOU LIGHTNING COMPLEX FIRE THAT

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:28.010
SAME AREA AT LEAST SUB AT LEAST

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:29.277
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THAT

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:32.047
PROPERTY. THAT WAS A SLATED FOR

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:34.983
DEVELOPMENT. BURNT IN THAT FIRE

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.451
SO YOU HAVE A PROJECT APPROVED

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:37.486
AND THAT BURNED IN WITHIN A

01:17:37.552 --> 01:17:40.255
MONTH. AND FORTUNATELY IT

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.523
WASN'T BUILT YET BUT WHAT HAVE

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.924
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF

01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:43.525
THAT COMMUNITY WAS ALREADY IN

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:47.029
PLACE. SO GENERALLY SPEAKING

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.096
WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT IN THIS

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:49.664
ECOSYSTEM THESE GRASSLANDS AND

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.500
WOODLAND ECOSYSTEM INVOLVES

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:53.368
REALLY. AVOIDING THAT CONFLICT

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:54.503
IN THE FIRST PLACE I GUESS I

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:57.305
COULD BE SAID FOR MANY OF THE

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:57.906
OF THE HABITATS AS WELL IN THE

01:17:57.973 --> 01:17:59.741
STATE. AND WE'RE THESE AT WORK

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:01.877
MEETINGS ALREADY EXIST. WE TO

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:03.311
MAKE SURE THAT THAT HOME HARD

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:05.414
NEED A DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS PUT

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.382
INTO PLACE. AS WELL AS PROVIDES

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:12.888
COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS MEASURES.

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:14.990
SO SHIFTING GEARS A LITTLE BIT.

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:15.524
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.359
INTERPLAY BETWEEN VEGETATION

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:19.761
HIRING CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M NOT

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.163
A CLIMATE SCIENTIST A BOTANIST

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:22.898
SO HOPEFULLY THIS IS A TO

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:26.234
COUNTY. HI CHANGES CERTAINLY.

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:28.270
IT CERTAINLY AND QUITE

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:28.837
LITERALLY ADDING FUEL TO THE

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:31.039
FIRE. BUT AS A SIDE IS A

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:32.407
BELIEVES DEEPLY IN THE URGENCY

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:34.576
OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I ALSO WANT

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:35.944
TO BE HONEST THAT IS NOT ALWAYS

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:37.345
EASY TO SEPARATE THE MEDIA

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:39.881
FACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FROM

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:42.484
NATIONAL FOOT NATURAL PHENOMENA

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.052
LIKE OUR AUGUST HEAT WAVE. THE

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:46.054
ACCOMPANYING FREAK LIGHTNING

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:46.988
STORM THAT OCCURRED IN NORTH

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:48.757
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN A

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:50.392
HISTORIC DROUGHT THAT OCCURRED

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:52.060
A COUPLE YEARS AGO OF COURSE

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:52.961
SOME OF THESE FACTORS MAY BE

01:18:53.028 --> 01:18:54.763
DRIVEN BY WILD BY CLIMATE

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:55.764
CHANGE AND RESEARCHERS ARE

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:56.998
CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THESE

01:18:57.065 --> 01:18:59.935
FACTORS TO DIGEST DISSECT OUT

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:02.137
THE CLOCK BECAUSE IT'S- BUT

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:03.605
WHAT I WILL SAY. THINGS LIKE

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:05.173
DROUGHT AND HEATWAVES AND

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.842
LIGHTNING STORMS. HAVE BEEN A

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:08.310
LONG EVER IN CALIFORNIA FOR A

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:11.012
LONG TIME. AND MAY BE ACTUALLY

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:11.580
JUST EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:14.549
CHANGE. SO CAN BE A CHALLENGING

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:16.118
THING TO DISSECT ALL THESE

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:17.886
THESE PIECES. BUT HERE ARE A

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:19.421
FEW THINGS THAT WE KNOW A FEW

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:22.224
TAKEAWAYS. FIRST LOOKING AT THE

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:25.827
SIERRA NEVADA. A STUDY BY-EMINENT FIRE SIGNED HIS JOHN

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:28.430
KEALEY AND ALEC SEIFERT IN

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:28.964
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHOW THAT

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:31.600
THERE IS AN INCREASE IN ACREAGE

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:32.567
BURNED IN THE SIERRA NEVADA.

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:33.535
WHEN IT WAS LINKED TO HIGHER

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.303
SPRING AND SUMMER TEMPERATURES

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:36.872
EITHER THE CONDITIONS THAT YOU

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:38.306
WOULD EXPECT AND ARE

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:40.709
INGREDIENTS ARE OBSERVED IN OUR

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:42.410
CURRENT CURRENT. WELL THE

01:19:42.477 --> 01:19:44.079
CLIMATE CHANGE. SO YOU KNOW YOU

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.447
HAVE IDEAL BURKE CONDITIONS

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:46.481
ESPECIALLY WITH HIGHER

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:46.948
TEMPERATURES AND LOWER

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:48.884
PRECIPITATION THIS DECREASE

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.819
PERCENTAGE OF PRECIPITATION.

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:53.255
FALLING AS SNOW. AND YOU KNOW

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:56.258
SO. YOU KIND OF YOU CAN START

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.926
TO LOOK AT THIS WITH A MIX OF

01:19:57.993 --> 01:20:01.329
LATE. ADAM IN CONJUNCTION WITH

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:01.796
OUR LEGACY OF FOREST

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.565
MISMANAGEMENT AND PART OF THE

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:04.533
PERSON YOU CAN START TO SEE

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:06.701
KIND OF A WORST CASE SCENARIO

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.036
IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. LIKE I

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:11.473
SAID BEFORE THERE IS SOME REAL-

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.341
OPPORTUNITY FOR OPTIMISM IN

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:14.142
THESE HABITATS BECAUSE THERE

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:16.077
ISN'T THIS IS THE TYPE OF

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:16.645
HABITAT WHERE WE CAN DO SOME

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:19.848
MANAGEMENT. SECOND IN NON

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:21.183
FORESTED HABITAT FOR THE

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:21.650
SOUTHERN OF SOUTHERN

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:23.351
CALIFORNIA. THERE DOESN'T

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:24.653
APPEAR TO BE A ESPECIALLY

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.488
STRONG LINK BETWEEN INCREASED

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.356
TEMPERATURES AND INCREASED RISK

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:30.525
OF WILDFIRES. THIS IS WORK WAS

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:32.427
SUPPORTED BY THE BY RESEARCH BY

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.895
KEELY ENCIPHEREDAS WELL AS

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:35.530
FROM AND YOU KNOW IT A

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:37.199
PROFESSOR AT A COURT COLUMBIA

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:40.001
UNIVERSITY PARK WILLIAMS. AND

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.170
CO AUTHORS IN TWENTY NINETEEN.

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:43.138
THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:44.172
THAT THERE ISN'T THAT IT'S

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.473
ALMOST NEARLY AS WELL IT'S

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.375
NEARLY ALWAYS HOT ENOUGH AND

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:48.777
DRY ENOUGH FOR FIRES TO OCCUR

01:20:48.843 --> 01:20:50.412
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I MEAN

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:51.546
WE DON'T I DON'T I LIVE THERE

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:53.148
UP UNTIL A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:55.817
AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S PRETTY

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:56.384
EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:58.553
LIVE THERE. IN MANY CASES

01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.654
WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE LARGE

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.323
FIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:02.824
IS A MORE SO RELATED DEPRIVE A

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:04.659
PREVALENCE OF LUCK. ON STRONG

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:06.895
SANTA ANA WIND EVENT. AND IN

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.897
THE ABSENCE OF EARLY SEASON

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:10.732
PRECIPITATION. I'LL TALK ABOUT

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.000
THOSE SANTA ANA WIND EVENT WHAT

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:12.901
WE CAN DO WORK SOME

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:16.338
SUGGESTIONS. OF LOOKING AT IT

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:18.673
IN JUST A MINUTE OR TWO. THIRD

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.774
I'D LIKE TO HIRE A HIGHLIGHTED

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:21.076
AREA OF RESEARCH THAT IS

01:21:21.142 --> 01:21:22.644
INCREASINGLY TYING TOGETHER.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.447
CLIMATE CHANGE VEGETATION. AND

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:26.948
FIRE. IT IS CALLED VAPOR

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.049
PRESSURE DEFICIT AND THIS IS

01:21:28.116 --> 01:21:29.517
REALLY A BOTANIST TRYING TO

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:31.286
EXPLAIN A CLIMATE TO LOGICAL.

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:33.288
CLIMATE SCIENCE. SO HOPEFULLY

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:37.058
IT'S NOT TOO A- TO- OUT OF- TO

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:39.494
CONVICT. ASSEMBLY VAPOR

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:40.595
PRESSURE DEFICIT MEASURES THE

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:41.730
ABILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:43.565
ACT AS AS WHAT IS IT ASSEMBLY

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.433
GIANT FUN SUCKING MOISTURE OUT

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.235
OF ALL THE FUEL THAT HAS THE

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:48.770
POTENTIAL. TO BURN. BUT WHAT IS

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:49.971
CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE TO DO WITH

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:52.007
THIS. WELL WE KNOW THAT THAT

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:53.475
CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE HAS WARNED

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:55.610
WARMED BY ABOUT THREE DEGREES

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:57.345
FAHRENHEIT IN THE PAST CENTURY.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:58.446
WE ALSO KNOW THAT VAPOR

01:21:58.513 --> 01:21:59.981
PRESSURE DEFICIT REACHED RECORD

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:03.652
LEVELS THIS YEAR. AND RICHARD

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:04.819
FIVE MICHAEL TALK TO COLLEAGUES.

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:07.722
PUBLISHED THIS YEAR. FURTHER

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:09.057
JUGGLING BETWEEN VEGETATION

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:11.092
ARIDITY THAT INCREASING VAPOR

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:12.927
PRESSURE DEFICIT AND

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:15.030
CONSEQUENTLY INCREASE VIRUS SO

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:16.931
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SMOKING

01:22:16.998 --> 01:22:18.566
GUN BETWEEN THESE TWO FACTORS

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:21.503
THIS CERTAINLY COULD BE A- OF

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:22.070
COURSE THAT'S NOT THE END OF

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:24.272
THE STORY. ACCORDING TO JOHN

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:26.341
KEALEY ESSENTIALLY NEAR

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:28.276
ESSENTIALLY ALL A 100% OF ALL

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:30.612
SANTA ANA. WIND DRIVEN FIRES

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.380
ARE CAUSED BY HUMANS. AND

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:35.283
FURTHER 99% OF THE- BUT 99% OF

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:36.685
ALL FIRES IN COASTAL AREAS OF

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:38.853
CALIFORNIA. AND HISTORICALLY

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.156
ARE NOT CAUSED ARE ARE NOT OF

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:43.224
NATURAL ORIGIN. SO IT'S A

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.327
POPULATION INCREASES SO WILL

01:22:45.393 --> 01:22:47.529
THE NUMBER OF FIRE STARTS. AND

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:48.897
WILL NOT ISN'T HAS WOULD

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:50.432
INCLUDE IT MUST WE CHANGE THE

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:53.368
WAY WE ACT OR THE WAY WE PLAN

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.937
OUR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:57.339
HORROBIN OF MY TESTIMONY THIS

01:22:57.405 --> 01:22:59.341
MORNING I WANT TO LEAVE YOU

01:22:59.407 --> 01:22:59.874
WITH SOME CONCLUSIONS AND

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:01.643
RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST AND

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.578
FOREMOST. WE THE PLAN

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:04.612
PREEMPTIVE MEASURES AND

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:07.849
WILDFIRE RISK WITH NATURE AND

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.984
WITH BIODIVERSITY IN MINE. IN

01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:11.619
THAT WE NEED TO TAILOR WIVES

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:14.022
WHILE KERR SOLUTION BY REGION

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:16.825
AND THE AND ALSO BY HABITAT.

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:18.860
FOR EXAMPLE. AND FIRST WHAT

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:20.628
SOLUTIONS LIKE PRESCRIBED FIRE

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:22.197
THAT ARE GOOD FOR SOME PROBLEM

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:23.531
ARCTIC OUR POTENTIALLY VERY

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:25.767
PROBLEMATIC FOR CHAPARRAL AND

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.302
OTHER TYPES OF HAVE HAS

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:29.537
DOMINATED BY TRUCKS. NEXT IS

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:31.039
NOT TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:33.675
PRESCRIBED FIRE HOW WOULD BE

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:34.175
PRESCRIBED FIRE IS IT IS

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:37.746
IMPORTANT. SO THESE TO YOUR

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:39.914
TREATMENT TO LIKE PROVIDE FIRE

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:42.517
AND ECOLOGICAL BASE THE NAME.

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:44.986
NEED TO BE PLANTED IMPLIED

01:23:45.053 --> 01:23:47.055
WITHOUT DIVERSITY IN MIND. FOR

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:49.858
EXAMPLE- AIDED A PRESCRIBED

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:51.693
FIRE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.361
IMPLEMENTED IN THE SPRING WHEN

01:23:53.428 --> 01:23:55.096
I STARTED WHEN FOR EXAMPLE. FOR

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.264
EXAMPLE LIKE A RARE PLANT WOULD

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:57.732
ALREADY GROWING COULD BE QUITE

01:23:57.799 --> 01:23:59.334
DAMAGING TO THAT RARE PLANTS

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:01.202
THE SAME FIRE IMPLEMENTED THE

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:02.704
FALL AFTER THAT PLANT HAS SET

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:06.141
SEATS COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:06.741
IT. SO THERE'S SOME NUANCES TO

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:08.743
THIS. SECOND THINGS LIKE

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:10.044
EMERGENCY FUEL BREAKS

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:12.280
FIREBREAKS. IF NOT MAYBE IT CAN

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:13.448
BE A CONDUIT FOR INVASIVE

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:16.184
SPECIES AND- CAN FURTHER

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:18.019
INCREASE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:20.588
IN THESE COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY

01:24:20.655 --> 01:24:21.122
THESE PEOPLE PARTS AREN'T

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:23.291
MAINTAINED IN THE LONG RUN. I

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:24.492
WOULD SAY THAT INSTEAD WEEK WE

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:26.795
SHOULD REALLY. EMPHASIZE

01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:27.996
SOLUTIONS THAT LEAD TO THE

01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:30.832
MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DATA THAT IS

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:33.101
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF HARM.

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:35.804
FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:36.371
THE CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:39.040
STARTING NOW. I THINK IT'S SAFE

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:39.974
TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.643
CRACKED THE FUNDING OF THE

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:42.143
IMBALANCE BETWEEN FIRE

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:44.179
PREVENTION. AND FIRE

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:46.247
PRESERVATION. ACCORDING TO KATE

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.349
GORDON. DIRECTOR OF

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:48.983
CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE OF PLANNING

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:51.519
RESEARCH. A DOLLAR SPENT AS A

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:52.854
QUOTA DOLLAR SPENT TODAY SAVES

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.689
YOU ABOUT SIX DOLLARS AND

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:57.192
FUTURE EMERGENCIES. THIS REAL

01:24:57.258 --> 01:25:00.128
STITCHED IN TIME SAVES NINE

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.397
STATISTICS IS. ONE WILL FACE

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.132
PEOPLE SEE PEOPLE HOMES AND

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:07.101
LIVES. THIS IS NOT TO SAY WE

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:08.937
WILL NO LONGER NEED TO FIGHT

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:09.504
WILDFIRES THIS IS NOT GOING

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:12.273
AWAY. CLEARLY WE MUST CONTINUE

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.641
TO ENABLE OUR FIRST RESPONDERS

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.677
TO SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY. BUT

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:16.945
THERE IS VAST ACREAGE OF FOREST

01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:18.246
HABITAT COULD BE THAT COULD

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:20.782
BENEFIT FROM PRESCRIBED FIRE

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.283
ECOLOGY INFORM LAND MANAGEMENT.

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:23.418
THESE ACTIONS SHOULD NOT OCCUR

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:25.487
WOULD NOT ONLY BENEFIT HABITAT

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:26.154
BUT ALSO HELP TO PROTECT

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:28.590
COMMUNITIES THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:30.925
ARE INTERSPERSED WITHIN THAT.

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.727
YES WE KNOW THAT WINDERMAN

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:34.662
FIRES ARE PERHAPS OUR MOST

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:36.764
DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE FIRES.

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:39.234
CASE IN POINT BEING THE FLYERS

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.034
THAT YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:42.437
NAMES OF. THE CAMP FIRE TUBBS

01:25:42.504 --> 01:25:45.106
FIRE THE WILL THE FIRES TO

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:46.641
NEIGHBORS TO JUST NAME A FEW.

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:50.812
ADD THESE FIRE DEPARTMENT

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.113
INTEGRATED AND NANCED APPROACH

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.882
THAT INVOLVES SUCH THINGS AS

01:25:53.948 --> 01:25:54.916
FIRST PREVENTED FIRES IN THE

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:56.484
FIRST PLACE KNOW THAT ALMOST

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:57.852
ALL THESE CARS ARE ARE ARE

01:25:57.919 --> 01:25:59.754
STARTED BY HUMANS ONE WAY OR

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.824
ANOTHER. SECOND WE DO A BETTER

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:05.627
JOB PLANNING. IT DID BETTER JOB

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:07.328
OF PLANNING ENABLE DECISION

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:09.964
MAKERS TO SAY NO TO DEVELOPMENT

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:11.432
IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. WHEN

01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:12.734
WE ALLOW DEVELOPMENT IN THESE

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.736
AREAS WE PUT PEOPLE AND

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:16.738
COMMUNITIES IF FIRST RESPONDERS

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:19.941
AT RISK. THIRD WE NEED TO

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:21.376
ENSURE THAT EXISING

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:22.210
COMMUNITIES ARE RESILIENT TO

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:24.379
WILDFIRE AND THIS MEANS

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:25.146
DEFENSIBLE SPACE

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:26.915
RECOMMENDATIONS SUPPORTED BY

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.483
THE LATEST SCIENCE AND NOT

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.920
DRIVEN BY FEAR. TWENTY FOUR IN

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:34.155
ENABLING SWIFT EVACUATIONS AND

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:35.723
HARDENING HOMES SO THEY HAVE A

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:37.091
BETTER CHANCE OF SUPPLIERS

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:39.027
SURVIVING FIRES WHEN THEY

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:42.030
INEVITABLY OCCUR. FINALLY WE

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:43.932
CAN INVEST IN BETTER FIRE

01:26:43.998 --> 01:26:44.399
PROTECTION OF WEATHER

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:46.367
FORECASTING TOOLS USING THE

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:47.902
LATEST TECHNOLOGY SO THAT FIRE

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:49.370
CREWS AND HOMEOWNERS CAN BETTER

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:52.974
PREPARE AHEAD OF THESE EVENTS.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:55.076
HOPEFULLY WITH SOME OPTIMISM.

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:56.311
DESPITE OUR CURRENT CRISIS

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:57.779
THERE'S THIS IS STILL A TIME TO

01:26:57.845 --> 01:26:59.847
LEARN AND LISTEN. WE NEED TO

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:01.683
LISTEN TO FIRE SCIENTISTS LAND

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:04.185
MANAGERS. NATIVE AMERICANS WITH

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:05.620
THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.922
TRADITIONAL. KNOWLEDGE AND

01:27:07.989 --> 01:27:09.557
FIRST RESPONDERS TO SEE

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:12.193
FIRSTHAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:12.760
THIS IS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:16.497
MOMENT. LASTLY WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:18.199
FIRE PREVENTION WE NEED TO GO

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:20.268
BEYOND SIMPLISTIC FUELS

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:20.868
MANAGEMENT TO TAKE A TAILORED

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:23.638
APPROACH. THAT IS INFORMED BY

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:27.175
HABITAT AND REGIONAL AND THE

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:29.177
REGION'S AT THEIR CURRENT.

01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:32.213
KNOWING THAT. KNOWING WHAT WE

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.314
KNOW ABOUT THE STATE'S PART OF

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.149
OUR CITY AND OF OUR VARIETY OF

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:36.884
HABITATS THAT OCCUR HRE THANK

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:39.554
YOU STE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:41.689
FOR- THAT VERY INFORMATIVE

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:44.292
PRESENTATION I WOULD LIKE TO

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:46.761
OPEN UP THE QUESTION NINE BY

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:51.032
ASKING YOU. WHAT MAY BE A

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.900
SOMEWHAT PROVOCATIVE QUESTION A

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:56.304
MUTE IS. I SPEAK ABOUT THE NEED

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:58.773
FOR PLANNING- AND I'M WONDERING

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:02.076
IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO WEAR- AND

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:05.380
HOW- YOU WOULD RECOMMEND TO US

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:07.482
WE CHANGE OUR PLANNING EFFORTS

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:08.950
BECAUSE TO SOME DEGREE BECAUSE

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:10.885
THERE THERE IS PLANNING THAT

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:13.354
TAKES PLACE ALREAD SO. WHAT WE

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:15.490
NEED TO DO TO DO A BETTER JOB

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:18.526
IN THAT RESPECT. YEAH THAT THAT

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:20.428
CERTAINLY IS A PRODUCTIVE

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:23.031
VOCATIVE QUESTION- AND OF

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:25.133
COURSE I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:26.768
THE STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:29.337
WOULD TAKE CONTROL OVER LOCAL

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:29.937
AUTHORITIES IN THEIR DECISION

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:32.440
MAKING. BUT I WILL SAY ONE

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:34.842
THING IS THAT. THERE ARE OTHER

01:28:34.909 --> 01:28:37.311
YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER AREAS

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:38.179
OF THE I KNOW I KNOW OF THE

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:40.581
COUNTRY ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:42.617
TO RISK LIKE LIKE FLOOD RISK.

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:45.153
WE'RE THERE IS A HEIGHTENED

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:47.121
DISINCENTIVE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:49.157
TO OCCUR IN THESE AREAS. AND I

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:52.427
WOULD SAY THAT. IN SOME REGARD.

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:54.195
WE MAYBE AT SOME POINT IN THE

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:56.497
FUTURE FACE TO FACE WITH THE

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:57.932
TOUGH DECISION TO DO SIMILAR

01:28:57.999 --> 01:29:00.401
THINGS. IT WITH REGARD TO

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:02.737
WILDFIRE RISK. IN THAT WE MIGHT

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:04.539
NEED TO START DIS INCENTIVIZING

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:06.674
DEVELOPMENT IN THOSE AREAS AND

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:08.009
INCENTIVIZING DEVELOPMENT

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:10.478
ELSEWHERE WE'RE SIMILAR REST ON

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.647
A CURB. I ALSO THINK THAT WE

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:14.348
COULD DO MORE TO DISCLOSE TO

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:15.717
PROTECT TO HOMEOWNERS FOR

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:17.819
HOMEBUYERS AND RENTERS ABOUT

01:29:17.885 --> 01:29:20.688
THE RISK OF- OF WILDFIRES IN

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:21.723
THOSE AREAS BECAUSE THEN I

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:25.126
WOULD YOU KNOW. I HATE TO THINK

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.261
THAT MANY PEOPLE BY WHAT BY

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:29.263
HOMES IN THESE WILDLAND URBAN

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.099
INTERFACE I HAVEN'T REALLY

01:29:31.165 --> 01:29:32.400
THOUGHT SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT THE

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:35.236
RISK ACTUALLY IS. AND MAYBE IT

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:36.738
COMES AS A SURPRISE WHEN THEY

01:29:36.804 --> 01:29:40.141
EVACUATED AND IN THE WORST CASE

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:40.775
SCENARIO THEY LOSE THEIR HOMES.

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:42.910
SO I REALLY THINK IT SHOULD BE

01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:44.779
MORE UP FRONT IN THOSE IN THOSE

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:46.314
TYPES OF- YOU KNOW THOSE

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.648
DECISION MAKING PROCESSES FOR

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:50.418
PEOPLE- AND THEN OF COURSE. YOU

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:51.919
KNOW WHEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES DO

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:53.888
THEIR PLANNING EFFORTS WE COULD

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:57.658
DO MORE TO ON. TO I THINK IT'S

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:59.494
A DEVICE DEVELOPMENT AND MORE

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.562
DENSE URBAN CORES RATHER THAN

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:03.364
OF COURSE. LEADING DEVELOPMENT

01:30:03.431 --> 01:30:05.333
OCCUR IN THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:30:05.399 --> 01:30:07.668
OUTER CITY LIMITS NOW. THIS OF

01:30:07.735 --> 01:30:09.937
COURSE DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:11.339
ALREADY EXISTING DEVELOPMENT

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:13.107
WHICH WHICH AREIN THE WILD

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:15.209
EVERITT URBAN INTERFACE WHICH

01:30:15.276 --> 01:30:16.511
WE STILL NEED TO DO A LOT MORE

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:19.814
TO- TO MITIGATE FOR THOSE RISKS

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:20.414
THERE AND THAT THOSE AREAS AS

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:23.718
WELL. THANK YOU AND WHAT ABOUT

01:30:23.785 --> 01:30:25.887
WHAT ABOUT AT THE OF THE STATE

01:30:25.953 --> 01:30:29.357
LEVEL- ARE WE- STRUCTURE THE

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:31.359
WAY WE NEED TO BE- ARE THERE

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:32.360
CHANGES THAT YOU WOULD

01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:35.429
RECOMMEND. TO THAT WE MAKE IN

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:39.167
ORDER TO. A BETTER ADDRESS THE

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:42.503
ISSUES THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED.

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:44.238
WELL YOU KNOW THERE WHAT I AM

01:30:44.305 --> 01:30:46.340
BLANKING ON THE BILL THAT WAS

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:49.577
INTRODUCED THAT DID NOT MAKE IT

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:50.144
TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK WHICH

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:53.548
WOULD WOULD HAVE BAND-

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:55.082
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DEVELOPMENT

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:56.851
AND VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:59.053
ZONES AS AS OWNED BY CAL FIRE.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.421
THAT'S A BILL THAT THAT MY

01:31:00.488 --> 01:31:02.423
ORGANIZATION SUPPORTED. AND

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.559
DONE. ALL RIGHT WE CERTAINLY

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:05.860
WOULD WOULD SUPPORT SIMILAR

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:07.562
LEGISLATION IN THE FUTURE AND

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:09.030
IT THAT'S A THAT'S A STEP I

01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:10.665
SUPPOSE THE STATE COULD TAKE.

01:31:10.731 --> 01:31:14.802
THE STATE LEVEL. THANK YOU ARE

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:16.737
THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MS

01:31:16.804 --> 01:31:20.174
FRIEDMAN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:23.444
FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I HAVE

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:24.478
THREE QUESTIONS AND I DON'T

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:25.680
KNOW IF YOU WANT MAYBE I'LL ASK

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:27.181
THEM ALL THREE AND THEN YOU CAN

01:31:27.248 --> 01:31:29.217
ANSWER THEM SUPPOSED TO COMING

01:31:29.283 --> 01:31:30.151
BACK OF THAT WORKS FOR YOU

01:31:30.218 --> 01:31:33.321
YEAH- THE FIRST ONE- IT'S A

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:35.156
LITTLE BIT LIKE MR BLOOM'S

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:37.358
QUESTION BUT INSTEAD OF ASKING

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:39.260
ABOUT PLANNING EFFORTS AS WE'RE

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:41.162
BUILDING NEW PROJECTS I'M

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:42.396
WONDERING OUTSIDE OF THE HOME

01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:43.965
HARDENING AND WHAT INDIVIDUAL

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:46.167
PROPERTY OWNERS CAN DO TO MAKE

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:47.134
THEIR OWN PROPERTY MORE

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:49.303
RESILIENT. IF YOU HAVE IDEAS

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:51.873
ABOUT COMMUNITY WIDE RESILIENCY

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:53.507
OR RISK MITIGATION AND WHAT

01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:54.675
THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR AN

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:56.611
ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT'S THE

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:59.547
FIRST QUESTION- THE SECOND ONE

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:01.816
IS ABOUT- THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:04.285
FUEL REDUCTION BY- THAT THERE'S

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:05.720
A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT FUEL

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:07.121
REDUCTION BUT THERE'S BEEN LESS

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.322
CONVERSATION ABOUT TYPES OF

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:10.291
FUEL AND I'M WONDERING HOW

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.226
CHANGING THE FUEL TYPE HOUSE

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:13.060
HOW COMMUNITIES CAN LOOK AT

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:15.229
CHANGING FUEL TYPES AS A PART

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:15.796
OF THAT AND I GUESS PART OF

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.665
THAT MY LAST QUESTION IS. IN MY

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:18.466
AREA AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:20.601
STATE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.837
FROM THE FIRES AND CAN BE

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:25.239
ATTRIBUTED TO- INVASIVE NON

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:27.041
NATIVE PLANTS AND THE REPORT

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:30.778
THE ACTUAL REPORT. THAT WAS

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:31.379
GIVEN AS PART OF THE COMMITTEE

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:32.013
MATERIALS. THE IS A US LOOKING

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:33.381
AT THE CAUSE OF FIRES AND THEY

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:35.016
POINTED SPECIFICALLY EUCALYPTUS

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:36.751
IN SOME AREAS. AND I KNOW IN

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:38.619
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE. I

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:39.620
LIVE IN WERE A BUNCH OF US UP

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:41.222
HERE LIVE. A LOT OF THE NON

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:42.657
NATIVE GRASSES THAT ARE MIXED

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:43.624
IN WITH THE SHOPPER ALL I'M

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:45.059
TOLD ARE MUCH MORE FLAMMABLE

01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:46.427
THAN FOR INSTANCE THE POPULAR

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:48.429
FAVORITE PLACE AND OTHER.

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:49.830
NATIVE SHRUBS NATIVE GRASSES.

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.032
DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:52.366
ABOUT HOW THE REST OF LARGE

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:53.935
SCALE RESTORATIONS OF THESE

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.937
NATIVE SYSTEMS CAN HAPPEN I'VE

01:32:56.003 --> 01:32:57.538
HEARD. MIXED THINGS ABOUT

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:59.907
SEATING- IT SEEMS LIKE A NON

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:01.442
NATIVES ARE JUST THEY'RE JUST

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:02.843
IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH WHETHER

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:04.645
IT'S A RUN GO IN THE CREEKS OR

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:06.681
THE LEFTIST. IS IT IS THE

01:33:06.747 --> 01:33:08.215
SOLUTION ROUNDUP I MEAN WHAT

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.684
WHAT DO WE DO TO DEAL WITH IS A

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.986
GOATS- WHAT CAN WE DO IT

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:13.955
ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE WAY

01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:15.256
TO GET BACK TO THE- BETTER

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:17.425
ADAPTED NATIVE PLANTS. SO I

01:33:17.491 --> 01:33:17.992
KNOW THOSE ARE THREE JUMBLE

01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:22.163
QUESTIONS BUT- ANY COMMENT YOU

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.763
WANT TO MAKE ANY THAT WOULD BE

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:25.866
APPRECIATED. SURE I THINK THE

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.635
FIRST QUESTION I ASKED WAS ON

01:33:27.702 --> 01:33:30.571
COMMUNITY WIDE RESILIENCE IDEAS.

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:33.274
WELL I THINK THAT- I THINK

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:36.110
THESE YOU KNOW IT INDIVIDUAL

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:37.345
COMMUNITY TO BE MADE STRONGER

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:40.147
IF. THERE IS TRULY DISPENSABLE

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:43.818
SPACE AND ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:44.418
IN ALL THE HOMES THAT OCCUR IN

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:46.587
THEM. AND THAT COULD INCLUDE OF

01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:47.555
COURSE YOU KNOW FROM OURS

01:33:47.621 --> 01:33:49.323
PERSPECTIVE APPROPRIATE NATIVE

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:53.260
PLANT LANDSCAPING. I THINK ALSO.

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:55.629
I MEAN FOR ON MID WILDFIRE

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:57.765
MITIGATION MEASURES IN THE

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.200
AREAS AROUND THESE COMMUNITIES.

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:01.969
IN A IN THE IN A VERY JUDICIOUS

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:04.238
WHY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE I

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:05.840
MEAN IF IT IT'S EASIER IN

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:06.874
PLACES LIKE THIS YEAR AND ABOUT

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:10.177
I SUPPOSE WHERE WE'RE BY- THE

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:11.278
AREAS THAT ARE KIND OF

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:12.713
DISTORTING IT'S KIND OF DISTANT

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.148
FROM THAT COMMUNITIES COULD BE

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:16.317
TREATED WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE.

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:18.452
AND THEN. THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:20.888
LESSEN THE RISK OF THESE OF A

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:22.556
FIRE ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:24.291
PENETRATE INTO THOSE EXISTING

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:27.895
COMMUNITIES. OF COURSE YOU KNOW

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:29.230
COURSE HOME HARDING IS A BIG

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:30.765
DEAL I THINK THAT'S ONE OF OUR

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.967
MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS AND I

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:34.468
WOULD SAY THAT IN A BILLION- I

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:36.837
MEAN IT'S- I'VE- THESE

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:38.472
SOLUTIONS ARE ALWAYS LIKE. FOR

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:38.939
ME IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:34:39.006 --> 01:34:40.541
FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE TO SAY

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:41.709
WE WANT TO DO THESE THINGS BUT

01:34:41.776 --> 01:34:43.244
THEN I'M THINKING LIKE. DO DO

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:45.012
HOMEOWNERS ACTUALLY HAVE THE

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:45.980
RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:48.015
HARDEN THEIR HOMES. AND TO

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:49.683
CREATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND TO

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.685
ALTER THEIR LANDSCAPING SO. I

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:52.953
MEAN MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.889
SOME SORT OF GRANTOR OR LOW

01:34:54.955 --> 01:34:57.124
INTEREST LOAN PROGRAM. THAT

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:58.759
ENABLES PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY DO

01:34:58.826 --> 01:34:59.760
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TELLING

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:02.063
THEM. IS NEEDED. IT'S NOT THE

01:35:02.129 --> 01:35:04.732
PEOPLE ME NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:05.633
THEIR HOME BURNED BY A WILDFIRE

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:06.767
IT'S JUST THAT THEY MAY NOT

01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:08.803
HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY.

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:12.807
TO MITIGATE FOR THAT THOSE THAT

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:13.340
IT THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY

01:35:13.407 --> 01:35:16.777
ASKED. NOW I WANT TO ADDRESS

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:19.380
THE WHOLE IDEA OF LAND A LARGE

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:20.247
SCALE RESTORATION I MEAN THAT'S

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:21.449
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:23.617
SEE AS AN ORGANIZATION I WOULD

01:35:23.684 --> 01:35:25.686
LOVE TO SEE AS A AS A AS A AS A

01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:27.321
PERSON WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:30.224
THESE HABITATS. I REALLY THINK

01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:32.159
THAT IT NEEDS TO BE A YOU KNOW

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:34.662
THAT A TOKEN APPROACH. SCALE TO

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:36.931
THE PROBLEM AND SKILL TO THE

01:35:36.997 --> 01:35:38.165
AREA THAT WE WANT TO TREAT.

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:38.999
THERE ARE THERE ARE CERTAINLY

01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:41.936
SOME CASES WHERE- THESE KIND OF

01:35:42.002 --> 01:35:43.838
NON CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES MAY

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:45.706
BE MAY BE NEEDED I DON'T I'M

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:46.607
NOT SURE ABOUT GRAZING BY

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:48.242
CODES. BECAUSE THAT COULD ALSO

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:50.678
BE DAMAGING BUT BUT MAYBE. AND

01:35:50.744 --> 01:35:51.879
I WOULD SAY THAT THE BEST THING

01:35:51.946 --> 01:35:55.916
THAT WE CAN DO IS. X. IT IS

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:57.718
TRYING TO ENVISION WHAT WE WANT

01:35:57.785 --> 01:35:59.854
TO SEE OUT OF THIS OUT OF THE

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.322
URBAN YOU KNOW THE WILDLAND

01:36:01.388 --> 01:36:04.692
URBAN INTERFACE. AND THEN. AND

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:05.960
THEN TALK TO THE SCIENTISTS

01:36:06.026 --> 01:36:07.361
TALK TO THE PRACTITIONERS TALK

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.563
TO. THE FIRE PREVENTION

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.799
PROFESSIONALS. AND TO WORK

01:36:11.866 --> 01:36:13.834
TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THESE.

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:16.003
INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS THAT THAT

01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:17.271
WILL THAT HAVE BOTH BY

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:18.572
DIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:20.107
PROTECTION IN MIND. AND

01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:22.042
CERTAINLY YES ABSOLUTELY WE

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:23.210
NEED TO GET RID OF A LOT OF THE

01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:24.378
INVASIVE PLANTS THAT IS

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:26.113
SOMETHING THAT'S SO EASY. I

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.381
MEAN IT'S NOT EASY IN IN

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:28.816
PRACTICE NECESSARILY BUT IT'S

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:32.253
SUCH AN EASY THING TO. FOR US

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:33.888
TO PROMOTE BECAUSE- IT IT HAS A

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.756
GREAT ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS IT

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:37.291
REDUCES FUEL LOADS. IT'S A WEEK

01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:38.726
IT'S A WIN WIN SITUATION I LOVE

01:36:38.792 --> 01:36:40.694
WIN WIN SITUATIONS SO. I DON'T

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:41.562
KNOW IF I'VE ANSWERED ALL YOUR

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:44.465
QUESTIONS YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:45.099
ASK THEM AGAIN IF I DIDN'T DO A

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:49.837
GOOD ENOUGH JOB. THANK YOU MS

01:36:49.904 --> 01:36:55.209
RAMOS. THANKS SO MUCH- IN ONE

01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:56.510
OF THE QUOTES THAT SAID ALMOST

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:58.212
CATASTROPHIC FIRES OF THE PAST

01:36:58.279 --> 01:36:59.947
FEW DECADES HAVE BEEN WIND

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:03.851
DOMINATED FIRES YOU ALSO TALKED

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:05.553
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. EARLY

01:37:05.619 --> 01:37:07.288
THESE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE

01:37:07.354 --> 01:37:09.957
CAN'T CONTROL THEIR HAPPENING

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:10.925
AND WE JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH

01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:12.993
THEM. NO I DIDN'T APPRECIATE

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.695
THE FACT THAT YOU SAID THAT

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:16.096
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:16.997
HERE WITHOUT GIVING US SOME

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:19.266
HOPE SOMETIMES WHEN I HEAR

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:20.501
ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:22.770
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FACT

01:37:22.836 --> 01:37:24.572
THAT WE HAVE HOMEOWNERS THAT

01:37:24.638 --> 01:37:27.908
ARE. THAT WANT TO DEVELOP IN

01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:31.412
FIRE PRONE AREAS NO MATTER WHAT

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.046
WHEN I WHEN I HEAR THESE

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:35.282
THINGS. SOMETIMES IT IT TAKES

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:35.950
AWAY WHATEVER HOPE I MIGHT

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:40.054
HAVE- BUT IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.690
AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE TO

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:45.693
BE SURE TO HAVE. THE SCIENTISTS

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:46.293
WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE WHO'VE

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.096
STUDIED- IT SUCH AS YOURSELF AT

01:37:49.163 --> 01:37:50.631
SOME POINT THEY HAVE YOU AT THE

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:54.535
TABLE. WHEN WE'RE PLANNING SO

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:57.238

AROUND- WHAT IS IT THAT WE

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:20.127
NEED- SO THAT WE CAN SO THAT

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:22.529
THE STATE. CAN ACHIEVE SOME

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:24.732
NORMALCY WHEN IT COMES TO TWO

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:27.268
FIRES- WE CAN'T PREVENT THEM

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:31.272
BUT- WHAT CAN WE DO TO REALLY

01:38:31.338 --> 01:38:33.307
HAVE A PLAN. THAT'S GOING TO

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:38.679
HELP US MITIGATE THE V. THE

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:41.081
DISASTER THAT WE'VE BEEN LIVING

WITH THE RECENTLY. YEAH IT I

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:47.821

ASPECT OF PEOPLE REALLY KIND OF

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:52.159
A DESPERATE AT THIS POINT IN

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:54.828
TIME I KNOW THE FIREFIGHTING

01:38:54.895 --> 01:38:55.763
PERSONNEL DON'T LIKE THIS

01:38:55.829 --> 01:38:57.731
SITUATION THE HOMEOWNERS DON'T

THINK STRUGGLING TO COME UP

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:07.141
WITH SOLUTIONS. AND I THINK

01:39:07.207 --> 01:39:09.209
THAT THERE ARE THERE IS THERE

01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:10.644
IS THAT THERE IS THAT THE NOW

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:14.315
SOLUTIONS SO AND FOR AND FOR

01:39:14.381 --> 01:39:14.882
EXISTING COMMUNITIES SO FOR

01:39:14.948 --> 01:39:18.619

ON THE NEWS. OR YOU KNOW JUST

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:26.493
IN RETROSPECT STUDY WHAT'S

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.861
HAPPENING. YOU KNOW THAT THESE

01:39:27.928 --> 01:39:29.563
WIND DRIVEN FIRES THEY JUMPED

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:31.732
EIGHT LANES OF FREEWAY- THEY'LL

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.600
JUMP ACROSS THE RESERVOIR. YOU

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:35.803
DON'T SPOT A MILE AND A MILE IN

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:39.006
YOU KNOW. A MILE IN ADVANCE OF

01:39:39.073 --> 01:39:40.274
THE FIRE FRONT. THERE ISN'T I

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:43.477
MEAN. THERE ISN'T YOU KNOW A

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:44.878
HUGE AMOUNT THAT WE CAN DO TO

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.547
PREVENT THOSE WILDFIRES FROM

01:39:46.613 --> 01:39:50.184
PROGRESSING. NOW I DO LIKE THE

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:52.319
HOME HER NAME IS A REAL SO IS A

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:53.120
REAL PART OF THE SOLUTION WE

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:54.855
KNOW THAT IF YOU KNOW YOU

01:39:54.922 --> 01:39:58.359
PREVENT THAT YOU KNOW- MEMBERS

01:39:58.425 --> 01:39:59.159
FROM BEING SUCKED UP INTO THE

01:39:59.226 --> 01:40:00.928
EAVES OF THE HOUSE IS AND I'M

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:01.862
SURE THE FOLKS FROM CAL FIRE

01:40:01.929 --> 01:40:03.664
HOOK SPEAKER LATER TODAY

01:40:03.731 --> 01:40:05.532
PROBABLY WILL WILL CAN DO A

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:06.667
MUCH BETTER JOB OF THIS KIND OF

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:10.137
AN ANSWER THAT I CAN'T. IT

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:11.438
PREVENTS IT WOULD PREVENT A LOT

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.273
OF HOMES FROM BURNING. ALSO

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.775
DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS A BIG THING

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.009
SO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE OF

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:17.144
THOSE HOMES HAVE DEFENSIBLE

01:40:17.211 --> 01:40:20.047
SPACE. SO THAT WHEN. I FIRED IT

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:22.249
IS ADVANCING. IT'S NOT THAT.

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:23.617
THE FIREFIGHTERS DON'T HAVE TO

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.252
CLEAR BRUSH OR JUST KIND OF.

01:40:25.319 --> 01:40:26.820
GIVE UP BECAUSE I ME THEY NEVER

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:28.255
GIVE UP BUT LIKE. THEY MIGHT

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:30.824
HAVE TO GET IN THERE BECAUSE IT

01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:33.227
JUST REALLY IS INDEFENSIBLE IS

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:34.795
INDEFENSIBLE. NO THOSE ARE AND

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:35.963
THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW.

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:37.664
KNOWING THAT THESE FIRES ARE

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:38.665
GOING TO OCCUR IN THESE

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:40.434
COMMUNITIES. WELL WE NEED TO

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:41.368
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:43.237
EVACUATE I MEAN THAT'S A THAT'S

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:47.274
A BIG THING. SO SECONDLY I

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:48.675
WOULD SAY LIKE PHOTO THAT'S FOR

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:50.310
THOSE THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:51.979
AREAS THAT ARE THAT ARE NOW

01:40:52.045 --> 01:40:54.581
THREATENED. I THINK WE NEED TO

01:40:54.648 --> 01:40:55.749
DO WE HAVE NEED TO HAVE A REAL

01:40:55.816 --> 01:40:57.251
HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT

01:40:57.317 --> 01:40:59.620
WE CAN DO TO PREVENT. MORE OF

01:40:59.686 --> 01:41:00.821
THESE COMMUNITIES BEING BUILT

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:02.289
IN THOSE- IN IN AREAS THAT ARE

01:41:02.356 --> 01:41:03.624
AT A VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AND I

01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:05.392
KNOW THAT THIS IS. A REALLY

01:41:05.459 --> 01:41:06.760
COMPLEX ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S OLD

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:07.928
THERE'S LOCAL LAND USE

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:10.531
DECISIONS AND PRIVATE PROPERTY

01:41:10.597 --> 01:41:11.231
RIGHTS AND THAT KIND OF THING

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:12.766
AND PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:14.501
USE THEIR PROPERTIES. BUT I

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:16.170
WOULD SAY THAT THAT WOULD WE

01:41:16.236 --> 01:41:18.305
DON'T DEVELOP IN THESE AREAS

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:20.240
IT'S KIND OF A THAT'S A WIN WIN

01:41:20.307 --> 01:41:20.808
WIN WIN SITUATION AND THAT

01:41:20.874 --> 01:41:22.676
WE'VE- ESSENTIALLY CREATED

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.978
CONSERVATION LAND. AS WELL AS

01:41:25.045 --> 01:41:27.614
PREVENTED THESE AREAS FROM FROM

01:41:27.681 --> 01:41:30.117
ACTUALLY BEING- YOU KNOW NEW

01:41:30.184 --> 01:41:32.152
HOMES FROM BEING AT RISK. FROM

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:34.455
WILDFIRE. SO MAYBE THERE'S

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:35.722
SOMETHING WE CAN START DOING IN

01:41:35.789 --> 01:41:37.691
INCOME CITY LANDOWNERS AND

01:41:37.758 --> 01:41:39.827
MAKING IT AND DID AND

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:40.627
INCENTIVIZING CONSERVATION

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:42.529
INSTEAD OF. OF THE DEVELOPMENT

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:44.531
IN THESE AREAS AND I DON'T I

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:46.366
DON'T UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T. I

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:48.368
DON'T HAVE A I'M NOT A MAGICIAN

01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:50.170
I DON'T HAVE ANY I MEAN I MEAN

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:52.773
I'M- NOT A MIRACLE WORKER I

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.308
GUESS I DON'T HAVE ANY. ANY

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:55.409
WORK OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:57.811
SOLUTION YOU CAN WE CAN APPLY

01:41:57.878 --> 01:42:02.082
TO THIS THIS THIS REALLY-

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.649
CHALLENGING CRISIS. WE DON'T

01:42:02.716 --> 01:42:05.085
SELL YOUR SHORT. WHAT IS RISKY

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:07.254
TO JOIN ONE FOLLOWER IN THE

01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:08.489
LITERATURE YOU GAVE US FOR

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:11.191
INSTANCE FOR FIRE FOREST YOU

01:42:11.258 --> 01:42:13.460
SAID PRESCRIBED FIRES- AND

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:15.562
BURNING UP BUT FOR GRASSLANDS

AND BUILDING RESTRICTIONS AND

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.273
THEN FOR TWO CHAPARRAL YOU SAID

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.275
CONTROLLED BURNS ARE EXTREMELY

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:31.311
HARMFUL. SO IF AND FOR THOSE

01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:32.646
YOU ALSO RECOMMENDED THE

01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:34.414
HARDENING AND THE BUILDING

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:36.550
RESTRICTIONS. IT WHEN I TALK

01:42:36.617 --> 01:42:39.486
ABOUT A TEN YEAR PLAN OR SOME

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:41.655
PLAN. YOU'RE RIGHT WE WANT

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:43.924
SOMETHING NOW BUT WE NEED TO

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:46.326
LOOK TO THE FUTURE. SO IF WE

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:47.861
LOOK TO THE FUTURE ARE THERE

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:49.997
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN

01:42:50.063 --> 01:42:51.265
PUTTING TOGETHER A TEN YEAR

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:53.166
PLAN AND WHO WOULD YOU

01:42:53.233 --> 01:42:55.469
RECOMMEND TO BE PART OF THAT.

01:42:55.536 --> 01:43:00.140
PLANNING COMMITTEE. SO I'LL

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:02.376
JUST FOCUS ON THAT THE FOR THE

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:05.646
FOREST PORTION OF THIS SO. WE

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:07.047
CAN DO WE GET THIS I THINK THE

01:43:07.114 --> 01:43:08.348
STATE AND OF COURSE THE FEDERAL

01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:10.250
GOVERNMENT AS WELL THEY DO A

01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:12.853
LOT MORE INVESTMENT IN- IN

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.922
PRESCRIBED FIRE- THAT'S

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:16.657
SOMETHING WE CAN DO NOW START

01:43:16.723 --> 01:43:18.992
NOW AND INVEST. IN SUBSEQUENT

01:43:19.059 --> 01:43:21.828
YEARS. IF WE WERE TO PUT A

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:23.096
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:24.298
INVESTMENT IN THAT IN

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:26.133
PRESCRIBED TIRE. AND SOME LAND

01:43:26.199 --> 01:43:27.568
MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND AREAS

01:43:27.634 --> 01:43:29.102
THAT DESPERATELY NEED IT. WE

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:31.038
WOULD REPEAT A LOGICAL BENEFITS

01:43:31.104 --> 01:43:32.839
AS WELL AS REDUCE FIRE RISK IN

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.308
THESE AREAS SO. I OULD SAY

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:35.576
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ONE THING

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.277
THAT YOU CAN START NOW. AND IF

01:43:37.344 --> 01:43:40.647
WE INVEST IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:41.281
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE GREAT

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:43.817
BENEFITS. ALSO I'D SAY THAT WE

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:44.384
CAN START YOU KNOW LIKE YOU

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:46.987
KNOW THIS IS. IT IS NOT

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:47.854
SOMETHING THAT'S HARD TO

01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:49.556
PREDICT I MEAN ART NEXT YEAR

01:43:49.623 --> 01:43:50.691
WILL PROBABLY BE ANOTHER BAD

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:52.859
FIRE YEAR WELL OKAY. WE KNOW

01:43:52.926 --> 01:43:54.094
THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:56.129
WE CAN START NOW. AS FIRE

01:43:56.196 --> 01:43:57.798
SEASON HOPEFULLY DIES DOWN OF

01:43:57.864 --> 01:43:58.732
THE OF COURSE WE'RE IN A RED

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:00.100
FLAG WARNING IN NORTHERN

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:03.170
CALIFORNIA AGAIN TODAY- BUT

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:04.171
HOPEFULLY THERE'S NO NEW FIRES

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:05.405
IN AND HOPEFULLY IT'LL START

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:06.440
RAINING SOON SO WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:44:06.506 --> 01:44:07.708
START GETTING TO SOME OF THESE

01:44:07.774 --> 01:44:09.476
PREVENTIVE MEASURES. AND DOES

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:10.611
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE HOME

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:12.646
HARDENING AND COMMUNITY

01:44:12.713 --> 01:44:15.182
PREPAREDNESS. I THINK IT'S- ALL

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:17.951
OF US. TO NOT FORGET ABOUT

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:19.119
WILDFIRES WHEN IT STARTS

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:20.587
RAINING AND IN THE END OF THE

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:22.456
IF YOU KNOW IN. DECEMBER

01:44:22.522 --> 01:44:23.890
NOVEMBER JANUARY WHENEVER IT

01:44:23.957 --> 01:44:26.026
STARTS RAINING. AND THAT WE

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:27.861
ACTUALLY KEEP I MEAN. KEEP THE

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:29.796
FIRE LIT ON FIRE SO THAT

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:31.131
ACTUALLY WE DON'T ACTUALLY JUST

01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:32.799
WE SAY LIKE OKAY GREAT THE

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:34.201
TIRES SEEMS OVER THE RISK IS

01:44:34.267 --> 01:44:36.069
OVER WELL ACTUALLY. THAT'S OUR

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:37.738
TIME TO START PREPARING IT'S

01:44:37.804 --> 01:44:39.706
OUR START TIME TO START. AARON

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:40.741
FOR THINGS LIKE BY PRESCRIBED

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:42.709
FIRE. IT'S OUR TIME TO START

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.344
FOCUSING ON ON ON MAKING SURE

01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:45.646
THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO RESPECT

01:44:45.712 --> 01:44:48.448
DEFENSIBLE SPACE. SO I MEAN I

01:44:48.515 --> 01:44:50.517
THINK THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO.

01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:51.284
AND I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S AS

01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:52.519
LONG AS WE KEEP ON INVESTING

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:53.920
THINGS I SEE THAT THE SITUATION

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:57.057
COULD GET BETTER- YOU KNOW IS

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:58.558
BECAUSE EACH CHANGE THAT WE

01:44:58.625 --> 01:44:59.660
MAY. HOPEFULLY THAT'S WHAT THE

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:02.496
HOMELESS BETTER PROTECTED OR

01:45:02.562 --> 01:45:03.530
FOURTH IT'S A BETTER. MORE

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:05.332
RESILIENT. SO IT ACTUALLY WILL

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:06.333
NOT BURN AT SUCH A HIGH

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:12.172
SEVERITY. MS RIVAS AND THEN

01:45:12.239 --> 01:45:15.676
MISTER TANK HAS A QUESTION.

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:17.310
YOUR RECOMMENDATION AT THE END

01:45:17.377 --> 01:45:19.346
OF YOUR PRESENTATION WAS THAT

01:45:19.413 --> 01:45:21.648
WE NEED TO TAILOR. WILDFIRE

01:45:21.715 --> 01:45:23.283
SOLUTIONS BY REGION AND

01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:25.986
HABITAT- I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:28.088
DISCUSSED SOME OF YOUR- VIEWS

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:30.724
ON THIS BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.426
EVALUATING OUR CURRENT STATE

01:45:32.492 --> 01:45:35.095
EFFORTS IS THERE A PARTICULAR

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:37.364
REGION HABITAT THAT ONE WE'RE

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:40.167
DOING WELL AND THAT YOU WOULD.

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:41.134
OF SAY CALIFORNIA IS DOING

01:45:41.201 --> 01:45:44.571
WELL- AND ANOTHER MAYBE THAT WE

01:45:44.638 --> 01:45:46.873
SHOULD BE FOCUSING MORE OF OUR

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:51.178
EFFORTS ON. AFTER THAT'S A

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:53.113
THAT'S A THAT'S A HARD

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:55.615
QUESTION- I WON'T PRETEND TO

01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:58.785
KNOW. TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:01.288
EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE- I KNOW

01:46:01.354 --> 01:46:02.589
THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN TAKE SOME

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:05.058
LESSONS FROM SOME OF THE AREAS

01:46:05.125 --> 01:46:06.326
IN OUR IN OUR NATIONAL PARKS

01:46:06.393 --> 01:46:07.928
LIKE SEQUOIA KINGS CANYON

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:09.696
SOMEBODY. WHERE THEY'VE BEEN

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:12.165
ACTUALLY ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ON

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:13.767
A PRESCRIBED FIRE AND KIND OF

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:15.769
HABITAT MANAGEMENT FOR FOREST

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:17.671
HEALTH AND RESILIENCY OVER THE

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:20.140
DECADES AND SO YOU'LL SEE IN

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:22.476
THOSE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE. IT

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:23.877
DIDN'T OCCUR THE CONDITIONS OF

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:25.011
THOSE FORESTS ARE ARE MUCH

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:27.347
BETTER THAN YOU WOULD SEE AN

01:46:27.414 --> 01:46:28.181
ADJACENT AREAS THAT ARE THAT

01:46:28.248 --> 01:46:29.983
MIGHT BE PRIVATE FOREST LANDS

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:31.585
OR OTHER OTHER IS A NATIONAL

01:46:31.651 --> 01:46:33.720
FOREST. THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED

01:46:33.787 --> 01:46:35.856
AS MCH EFFORT SO THERE ARE

01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:37.657
EXAMPLES WE'RE WE'RE WE HAVE

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:39.326
DONE REALLY GOOD THINGS WITH

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:41.328
REGARD TO FOREST AND HABITAT

01:46:41.394 --> 01:46:44.331
MANAGEMENT FOR THE RIGHT

01:46:44.397 --> 01:46:47.033
REASONS. NOW I WOULD SAY. YOU

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:48.235
KNOW I'M YOU KNOW NOT TO NOT TO

01:46:48.301 --> 01:46:49.503
BE A BROKEN RECORD HERE IN AND

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:50.403
FOCUSING ON THE SAME THINGS I

01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:53.006
WOULD SAY THAT AS WE GET TO.

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:54.441
OBTAIN AREAS THAT AREN'T THAT

01:46:54.508 --> 01:46:55.575
REALLY ARE IN THE WILD AND

01:46:55.642 --> 01:46:57.611
URBAN INTERFACE WHERE THESE

01:46:57.677 --> 01:47:00.881
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AT RISK-

01:47:00.947 --> 01:47:01.314
HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN

01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:03.750
CONSTRUCTED. I THINK THAT IT'S

01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:05.118
A STATEWIDE WE COULD DO A

01:47:05.185 --> 01:47:06.153
BETTER JOB OF PREPARING THOSE

01:47:06.219 --> 01:47:08.889
COMMUNITIES FOR WILDFIRE AND

01:47:08.955 --> 01:47:09.990
THAT IS YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF

01:47:10.056 --> 01:47:11.591
THE CLASSIC THINGS DEFENSIBLE

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:13.860
SPACE THAT IS THAT IS PLANNED

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:15.729
YOU KNOW CORRECTLY. PROCREATE

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:19.866
LANDSCAPING- AND ALSO FOR YOU

01:47:19.933 --> 01:47:20.500
KNOW AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE

01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:21.568
HOME HARD NEED IS SOMETHING

01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:22.602
THAT THAT REALLY WORK WE'RE

01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:24.237
REALLY JUST YOU KNOW OVER AND

01:47:24.304 --> 01:47:25.038
OVER AGAIN EMPHASIZING AS

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:27.407
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE. AT IN

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:30.844
PLACE ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:31.478
WHERE WIND DRIVEN FIRES OCCUR.

01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:33.647
SO I MEAN I SAY THE KNOW. AND

01:47:33.713 --> 01:47:35.782
OF COURSE. OUR YOU KNOW. WE

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:38.652
DON'T HAVE GOOD I THINK IT JOB

01:47:38.718 --> 01:47:39.286
AS- OUR FIRE FOR CREWS. BUT I

01:47:39.352 --> 01:47:40.720
THINK WE ALSO OUR PRESCRIBED

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:43.590
FIRE CREWS BETTER. SO FUNDING

01:47:43.657 --> 01:47:44.691
THOSE FOLKS HO HAVE THAT

01:47:44.758 --> 01:47:46.893
KNOWLEDGE. IN THERE I PROBABLY

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.928
WHAT'S IN THEIR OFF SEASON OR

01:47:47.994 --> 01:47:49.629
WHATEVER. WHEN THEY'RE NOT

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:50.697
FIGHTING FIRES THAT WE COULD

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:52.032
EMPLOY SOME OF THOSE FOLKS TO

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:53.466
DO SOME PRESCRIBED FIRE USE

01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:55.101
THOSE SKILLS FOR. YOU KNOW FOR.

01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:58.905
ALTERNATELY. FOR EIGHT GRAND

01:47:58.972 --> 01:48:03.109
ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS. OUR NEXT

01:48:03.176 --> 01:48:04.678
SPEAKERS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO

01:48:04.744 --> 01:48:05.712
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES

01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:06.847
BUT I WOULD CALL TO YOUR

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:08.415
ATTENTION- EVERYONE IN YOUR

01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:11.818
PACKET THERE'S A HAND OUT-

01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:14.321
THAT'S- THAT THAT- ACRONYM IS

01:48:14.387 --> 01:48:17.123
CLOSED- IN LARGE LETTERS AT THE

01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:19.292
TOP AND THAT'S IT- A

01:48:19.359 --> 01:48:23.263
COLLABORATIVE- EFFORTS. IN

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:24.998
ORANGE COUNTY THAT ADDRESSES

01:48:25.065 --> 01:48:26.833
MANY OF THESE ISSUES AND MAY

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.803
PROVIDE US WITH A MODEL THAT

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:31.404
WOULD BE APPLICABLE ELSEWHERE.

01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:35.275
CHURTON THANK YOU MR HI JUST A

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:36.376
QUICK QUESTION YOU MENTIONED IN

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:38.845
YOUR- PRESENTATION SORT OF

01:48:38.912 --> 01:48:42.249
BRINGING. ADDRESSING DRAMATIC

01:48:42.315 --> 01:48:43.083
FUNDING IMBALANCE BETWEEN

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:44.117
FIREFIGHTING WILDFIRE

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:45.552
PREVENTION WHAT WOULD YOU

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:47.287
PROPOSE IN TERMS OF WILDFIRE

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:52.192
PREVENTION. WELL I WOULD SAY I

01:48:52.259 --> 01:48:54.327
DON'T HAVE THE I DON'T HAVE THE

01:48:54.394 --> 01:48:55.295
NUMBERS ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:56.897
BUT I SEEM TO I SEEM TO

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:58.598
REMEMBER SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE

01:48:58.665 --> 01:49:00.700
SPENT SOMETHING LIKE A HUGE

01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:02.903
AMOUNT OF DOLLARS ON. ON FIRE

01:49:02.969 --> 01:49:04.905
SUPPRESSION AND I THINK MAYBE

01:49:04.971 --> 01:49:07.040
LIKE IS IT LESS THAN 10% ON ON

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:08.875
THE ON FIRE PREVENTION TEN

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:11.578
PERCENT. RIGHT OKAY SO I WOULD

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:13.413
SAY THE REAL EASY FIRST STEP

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.215
WOULD BE TO BRING THOSE TWO

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:18.285
CLOSER TOGETHER- I'M NOT SAYING

01:49:18.351 --> 01:49:19.552
THAT WE AND I'M NOT SAYING TO

01:49:19.619 --> 01:49:20.787
REDUCE THE AMOUNT WE SPEND ON

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:22.622
SUPPRESSION WE NEED TO DO THAT

01:49:22.689 --> 01:49:23.857
WELL HOPEFULLY MAYBE OVER TIME

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:24.791
IF WE DO FIRE PREVENTION

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.459
EFFORTS. MAYBE WE'LL START TO

01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:29.696
START STOP HAVING TO SPEND SO

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:30.330
MUCH MONEY AND SUPPRESSION. BUT

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:31.264
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. SHOWS

01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:32.999
THAT IF WE DO THESE KIND OF.

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:34.734
PREVENTIVE MEASURES. IT

01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:36.469
ACTUALLY BECOMES CHEAPER FOR US

01:49:36.536 --> 01:49:37.804
TO FIGHT THE FIRE FIGHT FIRES

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:39.306
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WITH IT

01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:40.840
THAT A KIRK. OR THIS PARTY

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:43.543
STILL BECOME AS LARGE. OR THEY

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:44.144
DON'T THREATEN THE COMMUNITIES

01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:46.313
IN TH SAME WAY. AND SO REALLY

01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:47.614
I THINK THIS IS A THIS IS YOU

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:49.382
KNOW WE'RE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE

01:49:49.449 --> 01:49:50.116
LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO. SO

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:52.319
THERE. I THINK THAT THAT WE

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:54.087
COULD- IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A

01:49:54.154 --> 01:49:56.089
MUCH RELIEF TO OUR FIREFIGHTING

01:49:56.156 --> 01:49:58.892
PERSONNEL S WELL AS THEY

01:49:58.959 --> 01:49:59.793
DIDN'T HAVE TO. YOU KNOW.

01:49:59.859 --> 01:50:01.561
BEYOND AND YOU KNOW WORKING AS

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:02.963
HARD AS THEY CAN FOR MONTHS AND

01:50:03.029 --> 01:50:04.264
MONTHS ON END MAYBE THAT FIRE

01:50:04.331 --> 01:50:05.031
SEASON COULD GET A LITTLE BIT

01:50:05.098 --> 01:50:06.633
SHORTER. MAYBE YOU COULD GET A

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:08.668
LITTLE BIT LESS INTENSE. AND WE

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:09.869
CANNOT BUT FEWER HOUSES BURNED

01:50:09.936 --> 01:50:11.404
IN PURE PEOPLE'S LIVES THREATEN

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:13.006
TO THAT TYPE OF THING SO. I

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:16.476
THINK THAT THAT THAT. THAT YOU

01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:17.510
KNOW DECREASING THAT GAP. WOULD

01:50:17.577 --> 01:50:19.179
BE WHAT WOULD WOULD BE A

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:21.147
WONDERFUL THING. WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:50:21.214 --> 01:50:23.149
AREASWE CAN DEFINITELY. REDUCE

01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:24.584
THE AMOUNT OF OUT OF STATE OR

01:50:24.651 --> 01:50:26.286
OUT OF AREA RESOURCES THAT WE

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:27.020
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BRING IN

01:50:27.087 --> 01:50:29.122
WHEN. WE HAVE THESE PRETTY

01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:32.559
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IS SO.

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:34.127
WHAT YOU TO ONE OF THOSE

01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:36.429
CHALLENGES HAS BEEN. REGARDING

01:50:36.496 --> 01:50:37.697
WHETHER IT'S IN A VEGETATION

01:50:37.764 --> 01:50:40.967
MANAGEMENT OR- PRESCRIBED BURNS

01:50:41.034 --> 01:50:44.304
IS REALLY- NOT JUST THE- MONEY

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:47.807
BUT REALLY FINDING THE PEOPLE.

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:49.175
AND THE ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:50:49.242 --> 01:50:52.278
EXECUTE IT SO. IF WE WERE ABLE

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:56.816
TO- INCREASE THE FUNDING IN

01:50:56.883 --> 01:51:00.887
THIS AREA- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT

01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:03.823
ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER- OTHER

01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:06.159
PEOPLE COULD REALLY. ABSORB

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:08.061
THAT KIND OF SCALE BECAUSE I

01:51:08.128 --> 01:51:09.662
THINK THAT'S BEEN. ONE OF THE

01:51:09.729 --> 01:51:10.630
CHALLENGES WE'VE BEEN HEARING

01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:11.598
IS WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:15.502
ACTUALLY SCALE. THESE

01:51:15.568 --> 01:51:17.437
PREVENTION PROGRAMS. YEAH

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:18.705
THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:20.540
GOOD QUESTION I THINK I THINK

01:51:20.607 --> 01:51:22.242
WE CAN IT MAY TAKE A LITTLE BIT

01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:24.811
OF TIME- WELL COURSE WORK WE'RE

01:51:24.878 --> 01:51:26.746
IN A IN A PRETTY BAD. ECONOMIC

01:51:26.813 --> 01:51:28.481
STATE IN THIS IT RIGHT NOW

01:51:28.548 --> 01:51:30.517
BASED YOU KNOW DO THE COVERAGE.

01:51:30.583 --> 01:51:32.185
BUT YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE I

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:32.886
THINK THIS COULD BE AN

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:35.388
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO FIND YOU

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:37.023
KNOW WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT-

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:38.558
THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF

01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:40.193
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF WORK.

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:42.195
THERE ARE ALSO YOUNGER PEOPLE.

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:43.963
WHO HAVE. WHO HAVE BEEN RAISED

01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:45.899
WITH THAT WOULD YOU KNOW HAVE

01:51:45.965 --> 01:51:46.699
GROWN UP WITH THIS WILDFIRE

01:51:46.766 --> 01:51:48.568
CRISIS ON. ON THE FOREFRONT OF

01:51:48.635 --> 01:51:50.570
THEIR MIND. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:51.971
AFFECTED BY THESE FIRES THAT.

01:51:52.038 --> 01:51:54.007
THAT WOULD PROBABLY JUMP AT THE

01:51:54.074 --> 01:51:54.641
OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THE

01:51:54.707 --> 01:51:56.843
SOLUTION. AND SO I WOULD SAY

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:58.611
FUNDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

01:51:58.678 --> 01:52:00.013
AND TRAINING PROGRAM SO THAT WE

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.714
HAVE MORE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS

01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:03.983
LIKE PRESCRIBED FIRE. WOULD BE.

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:04.751
I THINK AN INCREDIBLY USEFUL

01:52:04.818 --> 01:52:06.753
THING. AND IT WOULD GET IT WE

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:08.221
KIND OF YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW KILL

01:52:08.288 --> 01:52:09.789
TWO BIRDS AT THE SAME TIME HERE

01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:10.924
AND THAT WE COULD PUT MORE

01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:12.525
PEOPLE TO WORK. WHILE ALSO

01:52:12.592 --> 01:52:15.061
SOLVING THIS THIS REALLY POTENT

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:20.266
PROBLEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:22.202

HAS- SPARKED A LOT OF

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:26.973
CONVERSATION HERE ON THE DIETS

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:29.375
AND TO I'M SURE WILL CONTINUE

01:52:29.442 --> 01:52:31.878
TO DO SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON

01:52:31.945 --> 01:52:34.013
TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER WHO IS

US BETTER ON THE BETWEEN WE

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:46.626
DRIVEN. VERSUS YOU DRIVEN FIRE

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:48.561
AND THE APPROACH FIRE

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:50.396
PREVENTION MEASURES FOR EACH

ORGANIZATION BUT I'M- SURE HE

01:52:59.005 --> 01:52:59.772
CAN GO INTO A LITTLE GREATER

01:52:59.839 --> 01:53:03.176
DETAIL ON THAT AS WELL. SO

01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:13.019

LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY BUT WE'RE

01:53:53.059 --> 01:53:55.094
GOING TO TAKE ROLE AND THAT'LL

01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:57.230
JUST TAKE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS.

YOU GET ME THE PERFECT A SEGUE

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:24.290

COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL

01:54:30.396 --> 01:54:32.131
O'CONNELL AND I'M THE PRESIDENT

AND CEO OF THE IRVINE RANCH

01:54:33.733 --> 01:54:36.002
CONSERVANCY. WE'RE A NONPROFIT

01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:37.837
ORGANIZATION IN ORANGE COUNTY.

01:54:37.904 --> 01:54:39.639
I'VE BEEN THE CEO OF THAT

01:54:39.706 --> 01:54:41.474
ORGANIZATION SINCE ITS FOUNDING

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:43.710
IN- TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:45.111
BEFORE THAT I SPENT THIRTEEN

01:54:45.178 --> 01:54:45.778
YEARS WITH THE NATURE

01:54:45.845 --> 01:54:47.947
CONSERVANCY INCLUDING SEVERAL

01:54:48.014 --> 01:54:49.282
YEARS AS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:54:49.349 --> 01:54:51.985
REGIONAL DIRECTOR. I ALSO SERVE

01:54:52.051 --> 01:54:53.286
ON THE DEAN'S LEADERSHIP

01:54:53.353 --> 01:54:54.921
COUNCIL FOR THE SCHOOL OF

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:57.323
BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:59.559
CALIFORNIA IRVINE. NUMB I'VE

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:02.128
BEEN WORKING IN- SOUTHERN

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:03.930
CALIFORNIA SHRUBLANDS FOR THE

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:05.398
LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS BOTH IN

01:55:05.465 --> 01:55:06.966
PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF

01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:09.969
THOSE SYSTEMS. AND SO I WANT TO

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:11.771
SPEAK FROM THAT TODAY. THE

01:55:11.838 --> 01:55:13.673
IRVINE RANCH CONSERVANCY IS A

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:15.708
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WE

01:55:15.775 --> 01:55:18.444
MANAGE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND

01:55:18.511 --> 01:55:21.514
ACRES OF PUBLIC LOCALLY OWNED

01:55:21.581 --> 01:55:23.583
PUBLIC LAND COUNTY AND CITY

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:25.318
LAND IN ORANGE COUNTY MOST OF

01:55:25.385 --> 01:55:27.220
IT PART OF THE HISTORIC IRVINE

01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:30.056
RANCH. AND OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP

01:55:30.123 --> 01:55:31.391
THOSE LANDS HEALTHY AND

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:32.492
RESILIENT AND PROVIDE

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.360
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO

01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:38.431
ENJOY THEM AS WE BEGAN MANAGING

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:39.999
THAT LAND WE DID WHAT LAND

01:55:40.066 --> 01:55:42.235
MANAGERS OFTEN DO WHICH WAS TO

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:43.970
DO AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:45.204
THREATS TO THE HEALTH AND

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:47.040
RESILIENCE OF THOSE LANDS WERE.

01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:48.808
AND IT TURNS OUT NO SURPRISE

01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:51.177
THAT THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT

01:55:51.244 --> 01:55:53.413
TO RESILIENCE OF OUR LANDS THAT

01:55:53.479 --> 01:55:55.715
WE MANAGE AS WELL AS MOST OF

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:56.749
THE SHRUBLANDS ACROSS SOUTHERN

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:58.885
CALIFORNIA IS TOO FREQUENT

01:55:58.951 --> 01:56:01.954
FIRE- SO WE BEGIN TO LOOK INTO

01:56:02.021 --> 01:56:04.857
THAT. ONE THERE'S ONE POINT

01:56:04.924 --> 01:56:06.192
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:08.061
WITH TODAY MORE THAN ANYTHING

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:08.861
ELSE IF YOU DON'T RMEMBER

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:09.896
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT MY

01:56:09.962 --> 01:56:11.931
TESTIMONY IT'S THIS. AND THAT

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:13.633
IS THAT CALIFORNIA ESSENTIALLY

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:16.536
HAS TO FIRE CHALLENGES AND WE

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:18.237
ARE CURRENTLY RESOURCE TO AND

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:20.006
STRUCTURED AND IMPLEMENTED TO

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:22.041
REALLY ONLY ADDRESS ONE OF THEM

01:56:22.108 --> 01:56:23.543
A MORE CONVENTIONAL CHALLENGE

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:24.477
AND WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:26.546
ABOUT IT EARLIER- WHICH IS THE

01:56:26.612 --> 01:56:29.082
FUEL DOMINATED FIRES. WE ALSO

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:30.116
HAVE HEARD THAT THERE ARE

01:56:30.183 --> 01:56:31.484
NGUYEN DOMINATED FIRES ON I

01:56:31.551 --> 01:56:32.752
WANT TO DRAW THE DISTINCTION A

01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:34.554
LITTLE BIT MORE FOR YOU BETWEEN

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:36.155
THOSE BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO

01:56:36.222 --> 01:56:38.091
UNDERSTAND THOSE DIFFERENCES

01:56:38.157 --> 01:56:40.026
THEN YOU CAN START TO BUILD

01:56:40.093 --> 01:56:41.060
SOLUTIONS FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH

01:56:41.127 --> 01:56:44.230
THEM. SO FUEL DOMINATED FIRES

01:56:44.297 --> 01:56:46.032
GENERALLY HAVE TO DO WITH

01:56:46.099 --> 01:56:48.668
HAVING TOO LITTLE FIRE PLUS

01:56:48.735 --> 01:56:50.703
PASSED SILVICULTURAL PRACTICES

01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:51.971
OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:53.406
THAT HAVE CREATED ESSENTIALLY A

01:56:53.473 --> 01:56:56.342
TENDER BOX- THAT CAUSES FIRES

01:56:56.409 --> 01:56:59.746
TO BE MORE. SEVERE LARGER AND

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:00.947
MORE CATASTROPHIC WHEN THEY DO

01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:03.416
OCCUR THERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

01:57:03.483 --> 01:57:05.218
THE FUEL LOADS IN THESE

01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:07.854
SYSTEMS. AND THE SOLUTIONS TO

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.322
THEM ARE LARGELY VEGETATION

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:11.491
MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS THINNING

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:13.693
FORESTS AND PRESCRIBED FIRE IN

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:14.293
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.596
HEARD ABOUT. CATASTROPHIC FIRES

01:57:16.662 --> 01:57:18.631
ARE INCREASING IN THOSE SYSTEMS

01:57:18.698 --> 01:57:20.133
OVER TIME DUE TO A NUMBER OF

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:21.901
FACTORS. AND IT'S ALSO

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:23.536
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WITH

01:57:23.603 --> 01:57:25.872
FUEL DOMINATED FIRES IGNITIONS

01:57:25.938 --> 01:57:28.107
ARE NOT NECESSARILY EXCLUSIVELY

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:30.443
HUMAN CAUSED. LIGHTNING IS

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:33.079
OFTEN AND HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN

01:57:33.146 --> 01:57:35.515
A- SOURCE OF IGNITION IN THOSE

01:57:35.581 --> 01:57:36.516
SYSTEMS. BUT I WANT TO SPEND

01:57:36.582 --> 01:57:38.084
MOST OF MY TIME TALKING ABOUT

01:57:38.151 --> 01:57:39.685
WIND DOMINATED FIRES BECAUSE

01:57:39.752 --> 01:57:41.387
IT'S A VERY VERY DIFFERENT

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:42.989
SYSTEM AND IT'S REALLY CRITICAL

01:57:43.055 --> 01:57:45.124
THAT WE UNDER. STAND THAT SO

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:46.526
THAT WE CAN START TO FIGURE OUT

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:48.227
HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT.

01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:50.096
CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN SOUTHERN

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:51.264
CALIFORNIA SHRUBLANDS

01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:52.865
ESSENTIALLY SANTA BARBARA TO

01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:55.568
SAN DIEGO. ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY

01:57:55.635 --> 01:57:57.970
BY STRONG SEASONAL WINDS AND

01:57:58.037 --> 01:57:59.906
THEY ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF

01:57:59.972 --> 01:58:01.974
FUELS. THE SPREAD OF THOSE

01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:04.610
FIRES IS CAUSED BY WIND NOT BY

01:58:04.677 --> 01:58:07.346
FUELS. WIND DRIVEN FIRES ARE

01:58:07.413 --> 01:58:09.549
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPRESS

01:58:09.615 --> 01:58:11.451
THROUGH CONVENTIONAL ATTACK.

01:58:11.517 --> 01:58:13.519
WE'VE HEARD HOW THE EMBER CAST

01:58:13.586 --> 01:58:15.421
CAN GO ACTUALLY UP TO FIVE

01:58:15.488 --> 01:58:17.023
MILES DOWN WIND. AND LIGHT

01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:18.858
HOUSES ON FIRE IN THE INTERIOR

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:20.226
OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:22.595
EVEN ON THE WILDLAND EDGE AND

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:23.930
THAT MEANS IT'S AN EXTREMELY

01:58:23.996 --> 01:58:26.132
UNCONVENTIONAL SITUATION.

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:26.732
COMPARED TO HOW WE'VE

01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:27.867
TRADITIONALLY THOUGHT ABOUT

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:31.370
WILDFIRE AND FIGHTING WILDFIRE.

01:58:31.437 --> 01:58:33.339
IN OUR SYSTEM FIRES ARE

01:58:33.406 --> 01:58:36.442
OCCURRING 90% MORE FREQUENTLY

01:58:36.509 --> 01:58:38.344
THAN NATURAL RETURN INTERVALS

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:40.146
THESE SHRUBLANDS HAVE ADAPTED

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:42.281
TO A SEVENTY TO A HUNDRED AND

01:58:42.348 --> 01:58:44.383
FIFTY YEARS- RETURN INTERVAL ON

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:45.651
FIRE WHICH MEANS THE FIRE

01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:47.887
HAPPENS AGAIN EVERY SEVENTY TWO

01:58:47.954 --> 01:58:49.388
HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS. AND

01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:50.690
WE'RE GETTING FIRES IN THE

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:52.692
SYSTEMS EVERY SEVEN TO TEN

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:55.294
YEARS WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S 90%

01:58:55.361 --> 01:58:57.563
OUT OF WHACK THERE'SALL KINDS

01:58:57.630 --> 01:58:59.265
OF PROBLEMS THAT THAT CAUSES

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:00.867
ONE OF THEM IS BAD IT CAUSES

01:59:00.933 --> 01:59:03.035
CONVERSION OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY

01:59:03.102 --> 01:59:05.404
HARDER TO BURN FUELS INTO

01:59:05.471 --> 01:59:07.573
FLASHY FUELS THAT ARE EASIER TO

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.208
IGNITE. AND THEY KERRIER THE

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:11.377
KERRY THE FIRE UP MORE EASILY

01:59:11.444 --> 01:59:13.513
AS WELL SO IT'S KIND OF THIS

01:59:13.579 --> 01:59:15.381
DOWNWARD SPIRAL. IT'S ALSO

01:59:15.448 --> 01:59:16.949
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT IN OUR

01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:18.317
NGUYEN DOMINATED SYSTEMS LIKE

01:59:18.384 --> 01:59:21.254
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHRUBLANDS

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.256
99% OF THE FIRES ARE HUMAN

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:25.892
CAUSED EITHER ACCIDENTAL OR ITS

01:59:25.958 --> 01:59:27.660
INTENTIONAL AND THERE ARE A

01:59:27.727 --> 01:59:29.395
NUMBER OF VERY COMPLICATED

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:31.197
DIFFERENT TYPES OF IGNITIONS.

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:33.399
FROM CAR- CATALYTIC CONVERTERS

01:59:33.466 --> 01:59:35.635
BURSTING TO POWER LINE FIRES TO

01:59:35.701 --> 01:59:38.971
ARSON- TO ACCIDENTAL- EIGHT

01:59:39.038 --> 01:59:42.241
SOURCES OF ALL TYPES BUT 99% OF

01:59:42.308 --> 01:59:44.243
THE FIRES THAT WE GET OR HUMAN

01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:46.379
CAUSED SO FIRE PREVENTION IS

01:59:46.445 --> 01:59:47.780
PARAMOUNT IN WIND DRIVEN

01:59:47.847 --> 01:59:51.317
SYSTEMS. OVER 90% AND THIS IS

01:59:51.384 --> 01:59:52.585
I'M TALKING ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY

01:59:52.652 --> 01:59:53.686
SO WE'VE LOOKED AT THE

01:59:53.753 --> 01:59:55.187
HISTORICAL IGNITION DATA IN

01:59:55.254 --> 01:59:57.390
ORANGE COUNTY. AND IT TURNS OUT

01:59:57.456 --> 02:00:00.526
THAT 90% OF THE IGNITION'S FOR

02:00:00.593 --> 02:00:03.062
FIRES OCCUR ALONG ROADWAYS AND

02:00:03.129 --> 02:00:05.798
UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. NINE

02:00:05.865 --> 02:00:07.967
OUT OF TEN A. MISSIONS. AND

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:11.037
ONLY 10% OF IGNITIONS. WHICH

02:00:11.103 --> 02:00:12.838
OCCURRED DURING THESE WIND

02:00:12.905 --> 02:00:14.840
EVENTS BECOME CATASTROPHIC

02:00:14.907 --> 02:00:17.043
FIRES AND THOSE OF THE FIRES

02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:18.744
THAT DO THE MOST OF THE DAMAGE

02:00:18.811 --> 02:00:20.146
SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

02:00:20.212 --> 02:00:21.647
LEVERAGE AND I THINK THAT'S THE

02:00:21.714 --> 02:00:23.115
MOST IMPORTANT THING WHEN WE'RE

02:00:23.182 --> 02:00:24.884
TRYING TO DEAL WITH WILDFIRES

02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:26.719
WHERE'S OUR LEVERAGE IN SOLVING

02:00:26.786 --> 02:00:28.454
THIS PROBLEM. IT TURNS OUT THAT

02:00:28.521 --> 02:00:30.423
IN NGUYEN DOMINATED SYSTEMS

02:00:30.489 --> 02:00:32.258
THERE IS A AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF

02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:35.027
LEVERAGE IN IGNITION PREVENTION

02:00:35.094 --> 02:00:37.897
DURING SANTA ANA WIND EVENTS IN

02:00:37.964 --> 02:00:39.532
OUR REGION IT'S BETWEEN

02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:40.666
EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR DAYS A

02:00:40.733 --> 02:00:42.068
YEAR WE JUST GOT FOR OUR SECOND

02:00:42.134 --> 02:00:43.903
ONE. OF THE YEAR OVER THE

02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:45.771
WEEKEND AND THERE ARE SEVERAL

02:00:45.838 --> 02:00:47.840
MORE PREDICTED FOR THE MONTH OF

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:50.042
COMING UP IN NOVEMBER BUT IF WE

02:00:50.109 --> 02:00:53.512
CAN PREVENT OR REDUCE IGNITIONS

02:00:53.579 --> 02:00:56.215
DURING JUST THOSE EIGHTEEN TO

02:00:56.282 --> 02:00:56.782
TWENTY FOUR DAYS A YEAR IN

02:00:56.849 --> 02:00:58.951
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

02:00:59.018 --> 02:01:01.253
MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.022
OF THE- THE SCALE OF THE

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:04.924
PROBLEM OF WILDFIRE. AND IT

02:01:04.991 --> 02:01:06.325
TURNS OUT THAT WHEN THAT

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:08.494
IGNITIONS THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE

02:01:08.561 --> 02:01:10.262
THESE WINDOWS VENTS ARE

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:11.797
ACTUALLY PRETTY EASILY

02:01:11.864 --> 02:01:13.332
SUPPRESSED IN ORANGE COUNTY

02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:14.834
THIS YEAR WE'VE HAD OVER TWO

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.936
DOZEN FIRE IGNITIONS AND NONE

02:01:17.003 --> 02:01:18.638
OF THEM MADE THE NEWS BECAUSE

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:20.439
THE FIRE AUTHORITY AND THEIR

02:01:20.506 --> 02:01:21.741
PARTNERS IN THE LOCAL FIRE

02:01:21.807 --> 02:01:23.142
DEPARTMENTS JUMP ON THEM RIGHT

02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:25.344
AWAY. AND THEY KEEP THEM TO TWO

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:27.079
ACRES OR LESS CERTAINLY FAR

02:01:27.146 --> 02:01:28.748
LESS THAN TEN ACRES THAT'S

02:01:28.814 --> 02:01:29.915
BECAUSE THE WINDS ARE NOT

02:01:29.982 --> 02:01:31.484
DRIVING THEM IN FACT JUST THIS

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:33.285
WEEKEND THERE WAS AN IGNITION

02:01:33.352 --> 02:01:34.086
THAT OCCURRED IN TO PAYING A

02:01:34.153 --> 02:01:36.055
CANYON. IN THE SANTA MONICA

02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:38.090
MOUNTAINS AND IT WAS RIGHT

02:01:38.157 --> 02:01:40.226
AFTER THE WINDOW VENT OCCURRED

02:01:40.292 --> 02:01:41.360
AND THE FIRE WAS STOPPED AT

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:43.062
LESS THAN TWO ACRES AND IT WAS

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:43.929
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WIND TO

02:01:43.996 --> 02:01:46.332
DRIVE IT. SO IF I LEAVE YOU

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:48.367
WITH NOTHING TODAY IT'S V&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:50.569
JUST THAT THAT WE HAVE TO FIRE

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:52.338
PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE SPENT MOST

02:01:52.405 --> 02:01:54.607
OF OUR TIME TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:56.776
THE CONVENTIONAL PROBLEM. OF

02:01:56.842 --> 02:01:58.878
FOREST FIRES WHEN IN FACT WIND

02:01:58.944 --> 02:02:01.180
DRIVEN FIRES IN SHRUBLANDS ARE

02:02:01.247 --> 02:02:02.848
EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND THE FACT

02:02:02.915 --> 02:02:04.750
AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND

02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:06.986
BECAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE THERE'S

02:02:07.053 --> 02:02:09.221
A LOT OF LEVERAGE AND THERE. SO

02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:10.356
THE SECOND THING I WANT TO TALK

02:02:10.423 --> 02:02:11.691
TO YOU ABOUT IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN

02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:13.359
DOING IN ORANGE COUNTY TO TRY

02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:14.794
TO DEAL WITHTHAT AND I THINK

02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:16.462
IT DOES PRESENT PREVENT OR

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:19.732
PRESENT A GOOD MODEL FOR HOW WE

02:02:19.799 --> 02:02:22.368
MIGHT DEAL WITH THIS. IT BACK

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:25.237
IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:25.871
FOURTEEN THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE

02:02:25.938 --> 02:02:27.873
AUTHORITY CHIEF. RECOGNIZE

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.275
SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:31.644
IMPORTANT WHICH WAS THAT. THIS

02:02:31.711 --> 02:02:34.046
IS A PROBLEM THAT IT ISN'T

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:35.247
POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRE

02:02:35.314 --> 02:02:37.149
DEPARTMENT TO SOLVE ALONE. IN

02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:38.784
FACT WHAT HE SAID WAS THE FIRE

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:40.019
DEPARTMENT SO YOU CALL AFTER

02:02:40.086 --> 02:02:41.654
THE FIRE BREAKS OUT. AND OUR

02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:43.222
PROBLEM IS ONCE THE FIRE BREAKS

02:02:43.289 --> 02:02:45.024
OUT IN ITS WIND DRIVEN THERE'S

02:02:45.091 --> 02:02:47.259
NOT A WHOLE LOT WE CAN DO. AND

02:02:47.326 --> 02:02:49.228
THAT'S A REAL ISSUE AND SO WHAT

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:52.765
HE DID. WAS HE CONVENED A GROUP

02:02:52.832 --> 02:02:54.333
THAT WE CALL THE COUNTY OF

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:56.736
ORANGE AREA SAFETY TASK FORCE.

02:02:56.802 --> 02:02:58.304
WHICH IS COAST BUT IT'S THE

02:02:58.370 --> 02:03:00.039
FIRE PREVENTION WORKING GROUP.

02:03:00.106 --> 02:03:01.440
AND IT'S MORE THAN TWO DOZEN

02:03:01.507 --> 02:03:03.776
AGENCIES ORGANIZATIONS LAND

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:06.412
MANAGERS- UTILITY COMPANIES

02:03:06.479 --> 02:03:09.348
ROAD AGENCIES. EVERYONE WHO HAS

02:03:09.415 --> 02:03:13.018
A PART. IN WORKING ON THE ISSUE

02:03:13.085 --> 02:03:14.787
OF WIND DRIVEN FIRES IN OUR

02:03:14.854 --> 02:03:17.323
SYSTEMS. AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER

02:03:17.389 --> 02:03:18.958
AND WE'RE ALL WORKING ON IT.

02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:20.826
AND IT'S A SITUATION WHERE.

02:03:20.893 --> 02:03:22.828
THERE ISN'T ANY FINGER POINTING

02:03:22.895 --> 02:03:24.296
THERE ISN'T ANY BLAME BEING

02:03:24.363 --> 02:03:25.631
CAST EVERYONE IS BROUGHT

02:03:25.698 --> 02:03:27.800
TOGETHER BY THE SAME GOAL WHICH

02:03:27.867 --> 02:03:30.402
IS REDUCING. THE FREQUENCY THE

02:03:30.469 --> 02:03:32.705
SPREAD AND THE SEVERITY OF

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:35.007
THESE WIND DRIVEN FIRES. SO THE

02:03:35.074 --> 02:03:37.076
LAST SIX YEARS AND MY ROLE IN

02:03:37.143 --> 02:03:39.245
IT IS THAT I WAS NOMINATED- BY

02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:40.279
THE GROUP TO BE THE

02:03:40.346 --> 02:03:42.348
FACILITATOR. OF THAT GROUP AND

02:03:42.414 --> 02:03:43.916
SO I HAVE BEEN THE FACILITATOR

02:03:43.983 --> 02:03:45.584
FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS. AND

02:03:45.651 --> 02:03:47.153
WE'VE DEVELOPED A COMMON

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:50.256
AGENDA. FOR THE GROUP ON WHAT

02:03:50.322 --> 02:03:52.291
WE WANT TO DO WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:03:52.358 --> 02:03:54.593
TO GET DONE- THAT INVOLVES THE

02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:55.928
COMPLEXITY OF TRYING TO DEAL

02:03:55.995 --> 02:03:57.229
WITH THE WIND OF ADS. THE

02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:58.631
TRICKY THING IS BECAUSE IT'S

02:03:58.697 --> 02:04:01.667
NOT A FUELS BASED SOLUTION. ON

02:04:01.734 --> 02:04:02.635
WIND DRIVEN FIRES AND

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:04.537
SHRUBLANDS. THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:04:04.603 --> 02:04:06.372
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS TO IT RIGHT

02:04:06.438 --> 02:04:08.974
SO WE'VE GOT 83% OF OUR FIRES

02:04:09.041 --> 02:04:10.309
IN ORANGE COUNTY ARE IGNITIONS

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:12.011
AND ORANGE COUNTY START. ALONG

02:04:12.077 --> 02:04:14.013
PRIMARY ROADWAYS. THAT MEANS

02:04:14.079 --> 02:04:15.714
THE PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT OF

02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:18.217
THE COUNTY AND CALTRANS NEED TO

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:20.753
BE INVOLVED. THEY AREN'T

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:21.353
NECESSARILY STARTING THE FIRES

02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:23.689
THEM SELVES AND SO BRINGING

02:04:23.756 --> 02:04:25.391
THEM TO THE TABLE IN GETTING

02:04:25.457 --> 02:04:26.892
THEM TO WORK ON THESE SOLUTIONS

02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:27.993
WITH EVERYONE ELSE IS REALLY

02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:29.795
IMPORTANT. LIKEWISE WITH THE

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:32.264
UTILITIES WE HAVE 11% OF OUR

02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:33.866
IGNITIONS STARTING ALONG

02:04:33.933 --> 02:04:35.734
UTILITY QUARTERS AND BRINGING

02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:37.469
SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC

02:04:37.536 --> 02:04:38.304
WHICH SERVES THE SOUTHERN

02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:40.072
PORTION OF ORANGE COUNTY. AS

02:04:40.139 --> 02:04:41.640
WELL AS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:04:41.707 --> 02:04:43.209
EDISON TO THE TABLE AND WORKING

02:04:43.275 --> 02:04:45.277
CONSTRUCTIVELY HAS BEEN A

02:04:45.344 --> 02:04:47.446
CRITICAL ELEMENT OF IT. THE

02:04:47.513 --> 02:04:48.981
CURRENT FIRE CHIEF OF THE

02:04:49.048 --> 02:04:50.049
ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY

02:04:50.115 --> 02:04:52.785
BRIAN FENNESSY HAS DOUBLE OR

02:04:52.852 --> 02:04:54.353
TRIPLE DOWN ON THIS IDEA

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:56.121
BECAUSE HE REALIZES THAT A

02:04:56.188 --> 02:04:57.623
COHESIVE APPROACH WHERE

02:04:57.690 --> 02:04:59.491
EVERYONE IS WORKING TOGETHER.

02:04:59.558 --> 02:05:00.926
IS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN

02:05:00.993 --> 02:05:02.127
ADDRESS THOSE THINGS THE FIE

02:05:02.194 --> 02:05:03.762
DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE IT IN

02:05:03.829 --> 02:05:05.464
THEIR POWER TO DO ALL THE

02:05:05.531 --> 02:05:07.299
THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY. IN

02:05:07.366 --> 02:05:09.702
ORDER TO PREVENT THESE KINDS OF

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.470
FIRES. SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:12.605
TOGETHER WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:14.139
SUCCESSES AND THOSE ARE IN THE

02:05:14.206 --> 02:05:16.075
LITTLE FACT SHEET. THAT IS PART

02:05:16.141 --> 02:05:17.877
OF YOUR PACKET I WOULD ALSO

02:05:17.943 --> 02:05:19.378
ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ AND TAKE

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:21.580
A LOOK AT THE- THE PEER

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:23.148
REVIEWED PAPER ON WEDNESDAY

02:05:23.215 --> 02:05:24.717
VERSUS FUELS THAT'S INCLUDED AS

02:05:24.783 --> 02:05:26.118
WELL. THAT'S SORT OF THE

02:05:26.185 --> 02:05:28.187
FOUNDATIONAL PIECE OF SCIENCE

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:29.188
THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE

02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:30.656
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:33.225
FIRE REGIMES AND THEY'LL GIVE

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:33.826
YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT WHAT WE'RE

02:05:33.893 --> 02:05:36.228
TALKING ABOUT HERE. SO THE LAST

02:05:36.295 --> 02:05:38.430
THING I WANT TO MENTION. AND

02:05:38.497 --> 02:05:39.565
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

02:05:39.632 --> 02:05:41.734
QUESTIONS IS THAT IS WHAT ARE

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:42.935
THE SOLUTIONS THAT WERE WORKING

02:05:43.002 --> 02:05:44.470
ON WHAT WHAT HAVE WE DEVELOPED

02:05:44.536 --> 02:05:46.639
WHAT IS OUR COMMON AGENDA. N

02:05:46.705 --> 02:05:48.007
ORANGE COUNTY THAT EVERYBODY IS

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:49.675
PULLING IN THE SAME DIRECTION

02:05:49.742 --> 02:05:52.511
ON- AND THAT'S THREE THINGS AND

02:05:52.578 --> 02:05:54.113
WE ACTUALLY HEARD ABOUT MOST OF

02:05:54.179 --> 02:05:56.548
THEM- IF NOT ALL OF THEM TODAY

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:58.050
BUT THERE ARE THREE THINGS AND

02:05:58.117 --> 02:05:59.251
ALL THREE OF THEM HAVE TO BE

02:05:59.318 --> 02:06:01.253
DONE. EFFECTIVELY IN ORDER TO

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.122
GET AHEAD OF THIS AND MANAGE

02:06:03.188 --> 02:06:05.124
THIS- CATASTROPHIC FIRE

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:06.859
PROBLEM. THE FIRST THING AND I

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:08.827
CANNOT EMPHASIZE THAT ENOUGH

02:06:08.894 --> 02:06:11.864
IGNITION PREVENTION DURING WIND

02:06:11.931 --> 02:06:14.033
EVENTS. IGNITION PREVENTION

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:15.467
ALONG ROADWAYS IGNITION

02:06:15.534 --> 02:06:17.636
PREVENTION ALONG POWER LINES

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:19.038
AND IGNITION PREVENTION IN

02:06:19.104 --> 02:06:22.975
AREAS THAT ARE HOT SPOTS FOR

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:23.709
THOSE IGNITIONS WE CAN LOOK AT

02:06:23.776 --> 02:06:26.078
THE HISTORICAL DISTRIBUTION. OF

02:06:26.145 --> 02:06:27.479
CATASTROPHIC FIRE IGNITIONS AND

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:28.347
WE CAN FIND OUT THAT THEY

02:06:28.414 --> 02:06:30.349
ACTUALLY OCCUR IN AREAS WHERE

02:06:30.416 --> 02:06:32.284
THERE'S A CONVERGENCE OF HIGH

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:33.285
TECHNICIAN IN HIGH SPREAD

02:06:33.352 --> 02:06:35.521
POTENTIAL. AND IF YOU CAN DEAL

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:37.056
WITH IGNITIONS IN THOSE AREAS

02:06:37.122 --> 02:06:39.124
YOU HAVE REDUCE THE PROBABILITY

02:06:39.191 --> 02:06:41.493
OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE. THE

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:42.361
COMMISSION PREVENTION ABOVE ALL

02:06:42.428 --> 02:06:44.496
ELSE. THE SECOND THING AND

02:06:44.563 --> 02:06:45.731
WE'VE TALKED SOME ABOUT IT

02:06:45.798 --> 02:06:46.565
TODAY'S IS STRUCTURE

02:06:46.632 --> 02:06:48.767
RESILIECE- IT TURNS OUT THAT

02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:50.736
IN ORANGE COUNTY 80% OF THE

02:06:50.803 --> 02:06:52.338
STRUCTURES THAT HAVE BURNED. IN

02:06:52.404 --> 02:06:54.306
THE LAST TEN YEARS DO NOT MEET

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:56.909
BASIC FIRE CODES- MANY OF THEM

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:58.043
ARE IN THE INTERIOR OF

02:06:58.110 --> 02:06:59.979
COMMUNITIES THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

02:07:00.045 --> 02:07:01.280
NOT BURNED DOWN BY THE FIRE

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:03.382
FRONT. SO THEY'RE NOT HELPED BY

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:05.584
IT BY DEFENSIBLE SPACE OR EVEN

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:08.087
FUEL MODIFICATION ZONES THEY

02:07:08.153 --> 02:07:08.654
ARE BURNED DOWN BY THE EMBER

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:10.956
CAST. FROM ALL I'LL TELL YOU

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:11.724
JUST A LITTLE STORY TO

02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:13.726
ILLUSTRATE THIS SO I LIVE IN A-

02:07:13.792 --> 02:07:16.662
HIGH FIRE PRONE AREA- NEAR A

02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:17.196
WILDERNESS PARK IN ORANGE

02:07:17.262 --> 02:07:19.732
COUNTY AND- I WAS UP ON MY ROOF

02:07:19.798 --> 02:07:21.400
THIS SUMMER- PUTTING SCREENING

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:22.901
OVER MY FENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:07:22.968 --> 02:07:24.203
NO MEMBERS WOULD GET AND IF WE

02:07:24.269 --> 02:07:26.338
EVER HAD A FIRE. AND I STOOD UP

02:07:26.405 --> 02:07:27.439
AND I TURNED AND LOOKED AT MY

02:07:27.506 --> 02:07:29.208
NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. AND

02:07:29.274 --> 02:07:31.210
SHE'S IN HER LATE EIGHTIES AND

02:07:31.276 --> 02:07:32.478
SHE'S ON A FIXED INCOME AND

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:34.713
SHE'S ON THE HOUSE FOREVER AND-

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:36.415
I LOOK HER. AND SHE HAD CEDAR

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:38.684
SIDING. CEDAR SHAKES ON HER

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:40.519
ROOF AND A YARD FULL OF PAPER

02:07:40.586 --> 02:07:42.855
BARK EUCALYPTUS TREES. AND I

02:07:42.921 --> 02:07:45.424
THOUGHT THERE'S MY FIRE PROBLEM

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:46.692
IT'S NOT MY HOUSE IT'S THE

02:07:46.759 --> 02:07:48.627
HOUSE NEXT DOOR. AND WHAT THAT

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:50.929
ILLUSTRATES IS NOT ONLY AND

02:07:50.996 --> 02:07:52.898
SHE'S NOT A UNIQUE SITUATION

02:07:52.965 --> 02:07:54.433
WHAT WHAT WE HAVEIS WE HAVE

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:57.102
COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:59.471
PREPARED AND ARE NOT RESILIENT

02:07:59.538 --> 02:08:01.273
FOR FIRE. THE ORANGE COUNTY

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:02.875
FIRE AUTHORITY ACTUALLY HAS A

02:08:02.941 --> 02:08:04.043
PROGRAM THAT THEY CALL READY

02:08:04.109 --> 02:08:06.311
SET GO WHICH IS REALLY WELL

02:08:06.378 --> 02:08:07.880
DONE THERE'S A WEBSITE ABOUT

02:08:07.946 --> 02:08:11.350
IT. IT'S VERY CLEAR- HOW TO GET

02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:11.984
PREPARE NOT ONLY YOUR HOME AND

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:14.653
YOURSELF TO BE READY TO- FOR A

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:16.021
FIRE AND ALSO TO EVACUATE FOR A

02:08:16.088 --> 02:08:17.723
FIRE. IT REACHES A FRACTION OF

02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:19.658
THE PEOPLE THAT IT NEEDS TO AND

02:08:19.725 --> 02:08:21.427
THE PROGRAMS AND THE AND THE

02:08:21.493 --> 02:08:24.596
COST. OF FIXING SOMEONE LIKE MY

02:08:24.663 --> 02:08:26.198
NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE SHE CAN'T

02:08:26.265 --> 02:08:27.533
AFFORD IT AND WE'VE GOT TO

02:08:27.599 --> 02:08:28.367
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:30.803
THAT- SHE ACTUALLY HAS A- A

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:32.671
LARGE PALM TREE THAT EVERY YEAR

02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:34.306
GETS REALLY RATTY AND FULL OF

02:08:34.373 --> 02:08:37.409
DEAD FRONDS. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE

02:08:37.476 --> 02:08:38.444
OFFERED TO ACTUALLY PAY TO HAVE

02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:40.179
THAT- TRIMMED EVERY YEAR

02:08:40.245 --> 02:08:42.448
BECAUSE IT'S AS MUCH A FIRE

02:08:42.514 --> 02:08:44.583
RISK TO MY HOME AS IT IS. TO

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:46.685
HER HOME SO STRUCTURE

02:08:46.752 --> 02:08:48.587
RESILIENCE IS THE SECOND LEG OF

02:08:48.654 --> 02:08:50.522
THE STOOL THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:51.957
THROUGH THE- THE COAST WORKING

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:53.859
GROUP. AND THEN THE THIRD THING

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.127
AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS

02:08:55.194 --> 02:08:57.696
ENOUGH IS NOT LANDSCAPE SCALE

02:08:57.763 --> 02:08:59.665
FUEL REDUCTION IN SHRUBLANDS.

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:02.067
ALL OF THE SCIENCE SHE POINTS

02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:03.836
OUT THAT THAT MAKES VERY LITTLE

02:09:03.902 --> 02:09:05.571
DIFFERENCE ON THE SPREAD OF

02:09:05.637 --> 02:09:07.239
FUELS IN TROUBLING IS BECAUSE

02:09:07.306 --> 02:09:09.041
THEY'RE DRIVEN BY WIND. NOT BY

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:13.479
FUELS. IN SAN DIEGO IN TWO

02:09:13.545 --> 02:09:14.046
THOUSAND SEVEN FOUR HUNDRED

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:15.547
THOUSAND ACRES BURNED. A THIRD

02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:18.150
OF THAT LAND HAD BURNED ONLY

02:09:18.217 --> 02:09:19.651
FOUR YEARS PREVIOUSLY WHICH

02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:20.953
MEANT THAT IT WAS ALL JUST

02:09:21.019 --> 02:09:22.554
ANNUAL GRASSES THAT CARRIED THE

02:09:22.621 --> 02:09:26.325
FIRE. SO WHAT WE NEED THOUGH IS

02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:28.560
WE NEED STRATEGIC FUEL

02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:31.130
MODIFICATION ZONES- AND THEY'RE

02:09:31.196 --> 02:09:33.999
ALSO KNOWN AS DEFENSIBLE SPACE

02:09:34.066 --> 02:09:34.600
THERE'S A LOT OF SCIENCE THAT

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:36.468
SHOWS THAT A THIRTY METRE.

02:09:36.535 --> 02:09:38.003
ENVELOPE AROUND THE PERIMETER

02:09:38.070 --> 02:09:40.038
OF A COMMUNITY CREATES NOT ONLY

02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:41.573
DEFENSE ABILITY FOR

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:43.976
FIREFIGHTERS BUT IT ALSO- IT

02:09:44.042 --> 02:09:45.511
MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF

02:09:45.577 --> 02:09:46.845
THE RESILIENCE OF THE PERIMETER

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:48.780
OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND NOT

02:09:48.847 --> 02:09:49.915
JUST REMOVING VEGETATION

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:51.750
COMPLETELY THE TYPE OF FUEL

02:09:51.817 --> 02:09:52.985
THAT OCCURS IN THOSE FUEL

02:09:53.051 --> 02:09:55.120
MODIFICATION ZONES IS ALSO

02:09:55.187 --> 02:09:57.022
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT WE'VE

02:09:57.089 --> 02:09:59.091
DONE A PROJECT WITH THE CITY OF

02:09:59.158 --> 02:10:02.127
NEWPORT BEACH- WHERE WE CREATED

02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:03.395
WHAT WE'RE CALLING A WATER WISE

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:05.197
FUEL MODIFICATION PROJECT.

02:10:05.264 --> 02:10:06.498
WE'RE IN THE FUEL MODIFICATION

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:07.633
ZONES AROUND ONE OF THEIR

02:10:07.699 --> 02:10:10.302
COMMUNITIES WE ACTUALLY LANTED

02:10:10.369 --> 02:10:11.904
HEVIER FUELS AND MORE FIRE

02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:13.772
RESISTANT FUELS NATIVE FUELS.

02:10:13.839 --> 02:10:16.341
LIKE CACTUS AND REALLY WOODY

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:18.277
VEGETATION THAT ACTUALLY IS

02:10:18.343 --> 02:10:20.579
LESS FIRE PRONE THEN THE ANNUAL

02:10:20.646 --> 02:10:25.017
GRASSES THAT OFTEN INVADE A- A

02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:25.918
POORLY MAINTAINED FUEL

02:10:25.984 --> 02:10:27.719
MODIFICATION ZONES SO IT'S NOT

02:10:27.786 --> 02:10:29.188
JUST THE DESIGNATION OF THESE

02:10:29.254 --> 02:10:31.423
ZONES IT'S ACTUAL. RIGOROUS

02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:34.660
MAINTENANCE OF THESE ZONES- IF

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:35.594
YOU GET UP IN A HELICOPTER AND

02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:37.129
FLY OVER SOME OF THE

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:37.996
COMMUNITIESIN NORTHERN

02:10:38.063 --> 02:10:39.765
NORTHEAST ORANGE COUNTY- LIKE

02:10:39.831 --> 02:10:41.366
YOUR BEINDA AND BREA YOU'LL

02:10:41.433 --> 02:10:44.236
SEE BACKYARDS. THAT BORDER UP

02:10:44.303 --> 02:10:45.470
TO WILD LANDS THAT HAVE

02:10:45.537 --> 02:10:47.206
ABSOLUTELY NO DEFENSIBLE SPACE

02:10:47.272 --> 02:10:48.540
BEHIND THEM EVEN THOUGH THERE

02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:49.708
IS A DESIGNATED FEL

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:51.944
MODIFICATIONS ON THERE. AND

02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:53.879
THAT'S JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE

02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:57.983
SO WORKING TOGETHER IS REALLY

02:10:58.050 --> 02:10:59.151
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:10:59.218 --> 02:11:00.485
ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.

02:11:00.552 --> 02:11:03.188
IS AN UNCONVENTIONAL PROBLEM

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:04.923
AND WE ARE SET UP TO DEAL WITH

02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:06.892
CONVENTIONAL PROBLEMS LIKE OF

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:08.827
FOREST FIRES AND FUEL

02:11:08.894 --> 02:11:11.163
TREATMENTS WHEN IN FACT IT

02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:13.699
INVOLVES PREVENTION OF

02:11:13.765 --> 02:11:15.634
IGNITIONS ALONG ROADWAYS. AND

02:11:15.701 --> 02:11:18.303
SURVEILLANCE- TO PREVENT ARSON.

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:19.404
ALL MENTION ONE OTHER PROGRAM

02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:21.740
WE'RE WORKING ON AND THEN- ALL

02:11:21.807 --> 02:11:23.408
ALL TAKE WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU

02:11:23.475 --> 02:11:25.744
HAVE. AND THAT IS- A PROGRAM

02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:28.080
THAT MY ORGANIZATION RUNS BUT

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:29.081
THAT IS FUNDED BY THE COUNTY OF

02:11:29.147 --> 02:11:30.849
ORANGE THE CITY OF IRVINE AND

02:11:30.916 --> 02:11:32.517
THE CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH. IT'S

02:11:32.584 --> 02:11:35.354
CALLED ORANGE COUNTY FIRE WATCH.

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.222
AND IT'S A VOLUNTEER RUN

02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:39.057
ORGANIZATION MY ORGANIZATION

02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:40.859
SIMPLY ADMINISTERS THE PROGRAM

02:11:40.926 --> 02:11:41.960
WE TRAIN THE VOLUNTEERS WE

02:11:42.027 --> 02:11:44.263
DEPLOY THEM AND WE HAVE THREE

02:11:44.329 --> 02:11:45.264
HUNDRED AND FIFTY VOLUNTEERS

02:11:45.330 --> 02:11:46.765
THAT ARE TRAINED BY THE ORANGE

02:11:46.832 --> 02:11:48.800
COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY. AND WHAT

02:11:48.867 --> 02:11:51.270
THEY DO IS DURING HIGH WIND

02:11:51.336 --> 02:11:52.971
EVENTS THEY ACTUALLY ARE

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:55.941
STATIONED OUT ON THE LAND- IN

02:11:56.008 --> 02:11:57.576
AROUND THE PERIMETER MOSTLY

02:11:57.643 --> 02:11:59.678
ALONG ROADWAYS MOSTLY IN PLACES

02:11:59.745 --> 02:12:00.979
WHERE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF

02:12:01.046 --> 02:12:02.814
IGNITIONS. AND THEIR GOAL IS TO

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:04.650
BOTH PREVENT INTENTIONALLY

02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:06.318
MISSIONS LIKE ARSON AND THEY'RE

02:12:06.385 --> 02:12:08.920
ALSO TO REPORT AS QUICKLY AS

02:12:08.987 --> 02:12:11.256
THEY POSSIBLY CAN ANY IGNITIONS

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:13.025
THAT THEY MIGHT SEE SOMETIMES A

02:12:13.091 --> 02:12:14.593
MATTER OF FIVE OR TEN MINUTES

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.328
IN RESPONSE. BY THE FIRE

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:17.296
DEPARTMENT CAN BE THE

02:12:17.362 --> 02:12:18.530
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FIRE BEING

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:20.766
KEPT SMALL AND ONE THAT GETS

02:12:20.832 --> 02:12:22.567
OUT OF HAND AND CAN BURDENS

02:12:22.634 --> 02:12:24.703
LARGE MANY THOUSANDS OF ACRES

02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:26.071
ON A LANDSCAPE AND DO LOTS OF

02:12:26.138 --> 02:12:27.973
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AS WELL. SO

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.574
THIS PROGRAM HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:30.776
IN PLACE INCE TWO THOUSAND AND

02:12:30.842 --> 02:12:33.245
SEVEN- IT WAS RECENTLY ENHANCED

02:12:33.312 --> 02:12:36.181
BY A GRANT THAT WE GOT- FROM

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:37.316
THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SAFE

02:12:37.382 --> 02:12:39.318
COUNCIL FUNDED BY SOUTHERN

02:12:39.384 --> 02:12:41.520
CALIFORNIA EDISON TO CREATE-

02:12:41.586 --> 02:12:43.488
MALT WE BOUGHT MONITORS THAT

02:12:43.555 --> 02:12:44.523
ARE ATTACHED TO A HIGH SPEED

02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:46.291
WIRELESS NETWORK. THAT SERVE AS

02:12:46.358 --> 02:12:48.460
VIRTUAL FIRE TOWERS AND SO

02:12:48.527 --> 02:12:49.528
PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY NOT

02:12:49.594 --> 02:12:50.929
PHYSICALLY ABLE TO GO OUT AND

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:52.964
STATIONTHEMSELVES. OUT AROUND

02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:54.032
THE PERIMETER OF THESE LANDS ON

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:56.001
FIRE WATCH THEY ACTUALLYSIT IN%

02:12:56.068 --> 02:12:58.637
THE IN THE OPERATIONS CENTER

02:12:58.704 --> 02:13:00.939
WITH THESE AND CONFIRM MAN FIVE

02:13:01.006 --> 02:13:03.108
OR SIX VIRTUAL FIRE TOWERS AT

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:05.644
THE SAME TIME. AND THAT HAS

02:13:05.711 --> 02:13:08.313
BEEN A BIG SUCCESS IN ADDITION

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:09.581
TO JUST RAISING THE AWARENESS

02:13:09.648 --> 02:13:12.217
IN ORANGE COUNTY. SO I WANTED

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:13.118
TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL THE

02:13:13.185 --> 02:13:15.287
THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING- I

02:13:15.354 --> 02:13:16.688
THINK THAT IT'S A MODEL FOR

02:13:16.755 --> 02:13:18.423
PLACES AROUND THE STATE I

02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:20.158
CANNOT SAY AT ALL THAT WE'VE

02:13:20.225 --> 02:13:22.227
GOT THIS THING LICKED BY ANY

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:24.096
MEANS EVERY TIME THE WIND BLOWS

02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:25.630
IT'S WHITE KNUCKLE TIME AROUND

02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:28.734
HERE. AND BUT WE ARE ALL

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:30.202
WORKING TOGETHER AND THAT'S THE

02:13:30.268 --> 02:13:31.303
ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:34.005
ABLE TO CAN TO TACKLE THIS

02:13:34.072 --> 02:13:34.973
REALLY UNCONVENTIONAL PROBLEM.

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:37.242
OF WIND DRIVEN FIRES IN

02:13:37.309 --> 02:13:38.677
SHRUBLANDS IS A PARTICULARLY IN

02:13:38.744 --> 02:13:40.812
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO THANK

02:13:40.879 --> 02:13:41.980
YOU AGAIN I'M GRATEFUL TO BE

02:13:42.047 --> 02:13:42.881
ABLE TO DELIVER TESTIMONY FROM

02:13:42.948 --> 02:13:45.016
DOWN HERE. AND I'M HAPPY TO

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:45.817
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU

02:13:45.884 --> 02:13:48.687
HAVE. THANK YOU- VERY-

02:13:48.754 --> 02:13:51.223
INTERESTING PRESENTE AND- OF

02:13:51.289 --> 02:13:53.058
THE MAGNIFICENT BEGIN WITH A-

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:56.828
COUPLE OF. QUESTIONS THIS ISSUE

02:13:56.895 --> 02:14:00.766
OF ADMISSIONS- ALONG ROADWAYS.

02:14:00.832 --> 02:14:03.702
HAS VEXED ME SINCE. THE FIRST

02:14:03.769 --> 02:14:05.003
TIME I BECAME AWARE OF IT WAS A

02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:06.171
FIRE I THINK IT WAS NORTHERN

02:14:06.238 --> 02:14:08.073
CALIFORNIA THAT WAS. STARTED BY

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:09.508
A CAMPER THAT IT PULLED OFF THE

02:14:09.574 --> 02:14:11.843
ROAD- NEEDED TO SERVICES

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:15.213
VEHICLE I THINK. AND THE FIRE

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:17.783
STARTED UNDERNEATH. THE VEHICLE

02:14:17.849 --> 02:14:20.886
AND BEFORE THE DRIVER WAS

02:14:20.952 --> 02:14:23.688
VIRTUALLY OUT OF THE CAR- IT

02:14:23.755 --> 02:14:26.358
ALREADY TRAVELED UP THE- OF

02:14:26.425 --> 02:14:28.760
THE- THE EMBANKMENT- THAT WAS

02:14:28.827 --> 02:14:31.163
NEARBY. AND IT BECAME A VERY

02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:33.932
VERY LARGE FIRE WHAT WHAT

02:14:33.999 --> 02:14:37.002
STRATEGIES- ARE BEING

02:14:37.068 --> 02:14:42.641
CONSIDERED. TO DEAL WITH THAT

02:14:42.707 --> 02:14:43.542
VERY SERIOUS ISSUE. YEAH THAT'S

02:14:43.608 --> 02:14:45.043
A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND

02:14:45.110 --> 02:14:47.712
IN FACT- THE SOURCES OF

02:14:47.779 --> 02:14:49.815
IGNITION ALONG ROADWAYS ARE

02:14:49.881 --> 02:14:51.550
ACTUALLY HIGHLY VARIED AND

02:14:51.616 --> 02:14:53.452
PRETTY COMPLICATED THEY RANGE

02:14:53.518 --> 02:14:55.053
AS I MENTIONED FROM WE HAD ONE

02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:56.955
CALLED THE FREEWAY COMPLEX FIRE

02:14:57.022 --> 02:14:58.523
WHERE A CATALYTIC CONVERTER

02:14:58.590 --> 02:14:59.958
BURST AND I DON'T YOU KNOW

02:15:00.025 --> 02:15:00.792
ANYTHING ABOUT CATALYTIC

02:15:00.859 --> 02:15:02.227
CONVERTERS BUT THEY'RE INTENDED

02:15:02.294 --> 02:15:04.429
TO OPERATE AT ABOUT. FIFTEEN

02:15:04.496 --> 02:15:05.730
HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND

02:15:05.797 --> 02:15:07.232
THEY ARE MADE OF CERAMIC AND

02:15:07.299 --> 02:15:08.867
THEY MELT AT TWENTY FOUR

02:15:08.934 --> 02:15:10.068
HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND

02:15:10.135 --> 02:15:12.437
IT BURST AND UP PIECES OF

02:15:12.504 --> 02:15:13.872
MOLTEN CERAMIC CAME OUT THE

02:15:13.939 --> 02:15:15.674
TAIL PIPE AND LIT. AT LEAST A

02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:17.742
DOZEN IGNITION POINTS ALONG THE

02:15:17.809 --> 02:15:21.480
ROADWAY WE'VE HAD FIRE STARTED

02:15:21.546 --> 02:15:22.080
BY MAINTENANCE PRACTICES WE'VE

02:15:22.147 --> 02:15:22.681
HAD FIVE STARTED BY PEOPLE

02:15:22.747 --> 02:15:25.417
PULLING OFF INTO THE DRY GRASS-

02:15:25.484 --> 02:15:26.718
WITH A HOT UNDERCARRIAGE IN

02:15:26.785 --> 02:15:28.453
THEIR CAR AND STARTING FIRES

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:30.255
WE'VE HAD CHAINS DRAGGING LIKE

02:15:30.322 --> 02:15:31.957
WHAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING. WHAT

02:15:32.023 --> 02:15:33.658
ALL THAT LEADS TO IS IF YOU TRY

02:15:33.725 --> 02:15:35.093
TO FOCUS ON THOSE SOURCES OF

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:36.294
IGNITION YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE

02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:37.462
YOURSELF CRAZY BECAUSE THERE'S

02:15:37.529 --> 02:15:39.498
SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS. WHAT

02:15:39.564 --> 02:15:42.467
WE ARE FOCUSING ON IS HARDENING

02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:45.370
THE ROADWAY AGAINST ALL KINDS

02:15:45.437 --> 02:15:47.239
OF IGNITION SOURCES IF YOU MAKE

02:15:47.305 --> 02:15:50.475
IT HARDER FOR FIRE TO GET OFF

02:15:50.542 --> 02:15:52.878
THE ROAD BECAUSE AN ACCIDENTAL

02:15:52.944 --> 02:15:54.246
SOURCE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:56.481
THAT YOU CAN. PREDICT OR YOU

02:15:56.548 --> 02:15:58.383
CAN NECESSARILY EVEN PREVENT%

02:15:58.450 --> 02:15:59.985
LIKE YOU CAN IF YOU WITH ARSON

02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:04.055
DETERRENCE- IF YOU- IF YOU IF A

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:06.091
FIRE STARTS ON THE EDGE OF THE

02:16:06.157 --> 02:16:07.893
ROADWAY AND IT CAN'T GET OFF

02:16:07.959 --> 02:16:10.662
THE ROADWAY INTO THE DRY BRUSH

02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:12.731
OR INTO THE WILD LANDS. THEN

02:16:12.797 --> 02:16:15.200
YOU'VE CONTAINED IT AND SO WHAT

02:16:15.267 --> 02:16:16.368
WE I THINK WE NEED TO THINK

02:16:16.434 --> 02:16:17.802
ABOUT IS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

02:16:17.869 --> 02:16:22.474
THE ROADWAYS. AS NOT THESE OPEN.

02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:24.943
SYSTEM TO OPEN PATHWAYS THROUGH

02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:27.212
OUR WILD LANDS BUT THEY NEED TO

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:29.781
BE CLOSED CORRIDORS ALMOST LIKE

02:16:29.848 --> 02:16:31.750
A TUNNEL THAT FIRE CAN'T GET

02:16:31.816 --> 02:16:33.251
OUT OF. AND THERE ARE MANY

02:16:33.318 --> 02:16:34.319
DIFFERENT WAYS YOU COULD DO

02:16:34.386 --> 02:16:36.421
THAT YOU COULD DO IT BY. SIMPLY

02:16:36.488 --> 02:16:38.390
REMOVING VEGETATION FAR ENOUGH

02:16:38.456 --> 02:16:40.158
ALONG THE EDGE IN CERTAIN

02:16:40.225 --> 02:16:41.459
PLACES AND I'M NOT ADVOCATING

02:16:41.526 --> 02:16:43.228
THAT EVERYWHERE IN FACT IN SOME

02:16:43.295 --> 02:16:46.064
AREAS. RESTORING HEAVIER FUELS

02:16:46.131 --> 02:16:47.566
RIGHT DOWN TO THE ROAD THAT MAY

02:16:47.632 --> 02:16:49.434
BE A BETTER STRATEGY WE HAVE A

02:16:49.501 --> 02:16:51.102
TOLL ROAD IN ORANGE COUNTY THE

02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:53.138
SAN JOAQUIN HLLS TOLL ROAD.

02:16:53.204 --> 02:16:55.373
AND IT HAS SOME VERY VERY STEEP

02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:57.442
HILLS WHICH TURNS OUT UP HILL

02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:59.311
GRADES IS WHERE A LOT OF THESE.

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:00.879
ACCIDENTAL IGNITIONS OCCUR

02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:01.880
BECAUSE YOU GET A CAR BACK

02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:04.182
FIRING OR WHATEVER. AND WE HAD

02:17:04.249 --> 02:17:06.785
FAR FEWER IGNITIONS CATCH AND

02:17:06.851 --> 02:17:09.588
BECOME FIRES ON THAT TOLL ROAD.

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:10.322
AND ALLOW IT WE DON'T THERE'S

02:17:10.388 --> 02:17:11.423
NEVER BEEN A SCIENTIFIC STUDY

02:17:11.489 --> 02:17:12.958
DONNA BUT A LOT O THE FOLKS

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:13.858
WHO'VE BEEN IN THE FIRE SERVICE

02:17:13.925 --> 02:17:15.594
A VERY VERY LONG TIME. I

02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:17.195
BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT ONE

02:17:17.262 --> 02:17:19.097
OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE MANY

02:17:19.164 --> 02:17:21.833
PARTS OF THAT TOLL ROAD HAVE.

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:23.935
HEAVY FUELS RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD

02:17:24.002 --> 02:17:25.971
ROADBED SO WHEN A CHAIN DRAGS

02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:27.706
IT'S NOT GOING TO CATCH A WOODY

02:17:27.772 --> 02:17:30.342
BRANCH ON ON FIRE LIKE IT WOULD

02:17:30.408 --> 02:17:33.044
FLASHY FUELS. SO KIND OF A LONG

02:17:33.111 --> 02:17:33.845
WINDED ANSWER BECAUSE IT'S VERY

02:17:33.912 --> 02:17:36.514
COMPLICATED BUT THE MAIN POINT

02:17:36.581 --> 02:17:38.550
IS WE NEED TO LOOK AT HARDENING

02:17:38.617 --> 02:17:39.584
THESE ROADWAYS TO MAKE IT

02:17:39.651 --> 02:17:42.253
HARDER FOR IGNITIONS TO GET OFF

02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:44.956
OF THEM. SO THAT THAT'S A VERY

02:17:45.023 --> 02:17:48.126
INTERESTING RESPONSES AND- IT

02:17:48.193 --> 02:17:51.463
IT DOES LEAVE MAY TO SUGGESTED

02:17:51.529 --> 02:17:54.099
THAT PERHAPS IN ADDITION TO.

02:17:54.165 --> 02:17:55.467
WHAT YOU SUGGESTED CHANGES TO

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:56.968
THE ROADWAY THAT THAT NEED TO

02:17:57.035 --> 02:17:58.169
BE MADE THAT WE ALSO NEED TO

02:17:58.236 --> 02:18:00.972
EDUCATE MOTORISTS- SO THAT

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:02.807
MOTORISTS DON'T MAKE SOME OF

02:18:02.874 --> 02:18:03.875
THE MISTAKES THAT YOU'VE

02:18:03.942 --> 02:18:07.012
IDENTIFIED- IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:18:07.078 --> 02:18:08.446
THERE COULD BE A ROLE FOR

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:11.383
CALTRANS IN THIS- AT AND AS

02:18:11.449 --> 02:18:12.550
WELL THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR

02:18:12.617 --> 02:18:15.420
VEHICLES- BOTH AGENCIES HAPPEN

02:18:15.487 --> 02:18:17.255
TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF

02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:19.524
THIS SUBCOMMITTEE SO THOSE ARE

02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:20.659
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE MAY WANT

02:18:20.725 --> 02:18:22.827
TO HELP. GOING FORWARD THE

02:18:22.894 --> 02:18:26.431
OTHER QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU.

02:18:26.498 --> 02:18:27.499
HI IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE MADE A

02:18:27.565 --> 02:18:31.703
LOT OF. PROGRESS IN IDENTIFYING

02:18:31.770 --> 02:18:34.606
THE RISKS AND TO- COLLABORATING

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:35.840
AND WHAT THE SOLUTION SHOULD

02:18:35.907 --> 02:18:39.844
BE- WITHIN COAST. WHAT ARE THE

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:42.280
NEXT STEPS FOR YOU HOW DO YOU

02:18:42.347 --> 02:18:47.719
IMPLEMENT TESE- THESE PLANS.

02:18:47.786 --> 02:18:53.692
FOR AT. OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS

02:18:53.758 --> 02:18:55.827
WITH COAST HAS BEEN NUMBER ONE

02:18:55.894 --> 02:18:57.462
GETTING EVERYONE TOGETHER AND

02:18:57.529 --> 02:18:59.397
COLLABORATING TOGETHER AND

02:18:59.464 --> 02:19:02.367
SHARING THE AGENDA AND THE WAY

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:03.868
I LIKE TO SAY IT IS EVERYONE IS

02:19:03.935 --> 02:19:05.804
BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE PROBLEM

02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:07.772
EVEN THOUGH NONE OF US ARE

02:19:07.839 --> 02:19:09.441
INDIVIDUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:10.675
THE WHOLE PROBLEM IT'S LIKE

02:19:10.742 --> 02:19:11.776
IT'S EVERYONE'S PROBLEM AND NO

02:19:11.843 --> 02:19:13.244
ONE'S PROBLEM AND SO BRINGING

02:19:13.311 --> 02:19:14.112
PEOPLE TOGETHER AND HAVING

02:19:14.179 --> 02:19:16.581
EVERYONE BE RESPONSIVE IS A KEY

02:19:16.648 --> 02:19:18.183
THING IDENTIFYING WHAT THE

02:19:18.249 --> 02:19:20.018
SOLUTIONS ARE IS ALSO REALLY

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:21.820
REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THE NEXT

02:19:21.886 --> 02:19:23.521
STEP IS THE HARDEST STEP WHICH

02:19:23.588 --> 02:19:25.757
IS ACTUALLY. THESE SOLUTIONS

02:19:25.824 --> 02:19:27.592
NEED TO BE PROPERLY RESOURCE

02:19:27.659 --> 02:19:28.860
THEY NEED TO BE PROPERLY

02:19:28.927 --> 02:19:30.295
STRUCTURED MEANING THEY NEED TO

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:31.529
HAVE THE PROGRAMMATIC

02:19:31.596 --> 02:19:33.932
STRUCTURES WITHIN THE AGENCIES

02:19:33.998 --> 02:19:35.633
THAT HAVE A ROLE OR PART OF THE

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:37.168
SOLUTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED

02:19:37.235 --> 02:19:39.938
CALTRANS FOR EXAMPLE- A

02:19:40.004 --> 02:19:41.673
CALTRANS WE WORK VERY CLOSELY

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:43.808
WITH THEM PARTICULARLY-

02:19:43.875 --> 02:19:44.609
DISTRICT SEVEN AND DISTRICT

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:49.214
TWELVE. OF CALTRANS AND THEY-

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:50.682
THEY CAN WORK REAL HARD ON

02:19:50.749 --> 02:19:51.983
THEIR ROADSIDE MAINTENANCE

02:19:52.050 --> 02:19:53.384
PRACTICES BUT THAT'S ONLY

02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:55.320
DEALING WITH THE THINGS OF THE

02:19:55.386 --> 02:19:55.954
FIRES THAT THEY MIGHT

02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:58.690
POTENTIALLY START THEY IF WE'RE

02:19:58.757 --> 02:20:00.325
GOING TO HAVE A SOLUTION THAT'S

02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:02.193
BROUGHT THROUGH CALTRANS IT

02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:03.428
NEEDS TO BE BOTH PROPERLY

02:20:03.495 --> 02:20:04.462
RESOURCE BUT IT NEEDS TO BE

02:20:04.529 --> 02:20:06.564
PROPERLY STRUCTURED WITHIN THAT

02:20:06.631 --> 02:20:08.333
AGENCY IN ORDER TO BE

02:20:08.399 --> 02:20:11.736
IMPLEMENTED SO- NOW WE'RE

02:20:11.803 --> 02:20:13.772
LOOKING AT THE REAL TOUGH PART

02:20:13.838 --> 02:20:15.673
WHICH IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:17.776
GET BOTH THE FUNDING AND POLICY

02:20:17.842 --> 02:20:20.445
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO.

02:20:20.512 --> 02:20:22.080
IMPLEMENT IGNITION PREVENTION

02:20:22.147 --> 02:20:25.183
STRUCTURE RESILIENCE AND

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:25.750
STRATEGIC FUEL MODIFICATION

02:20:25.817 --> 02:20:27.752
ZONES. GREAT THANK YOU LET US

02:20:27.819 --> 02:20:28.586
KNOW WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE

02:20:28.653 --> 02:20:30.455
THE MONEY'S GOING TO COME FROM-

02:20:30.522 --> 02:20:31.656
ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

PRESENTATION IT WAS VERY VERY

02:20:37.629 --> 02:20:39.998
HELPFUL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT-

02:20:40.064 --> 02:20:41.332
I HAVE A I GUESS A QUESTION

02:20:41.399 --> 02:20:44.369
OBSERVATION AND- YOU KNOW. IT

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:45.570
SEEMS TO ME AND MAYBE I'M WRONG

02:20:45.637 --> 02:20:47.539
THAT THERE ARE- AS MUCH AS

02:20:47.605 --> 02:20:49.374
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT-

02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.609
SOURCES OF IGNITION. THAT ROAD

02:20:51.676 --> 02:20:53.912
CREWS OR CREWS WORKING IN HIGH

02:20:53.978 --> 02:20:56.381
FIRE BRUSH LANDSCAPING CREWS

02:20:56.447 --> 02:20:57.949
ECCENTRICITY MIKE THEY ARE

02:20:58.016 --> 02:21:00.251
RESPONSIBLE FOR A FAIR AMOUNT

02:21:00.318 --> 02:21:03.154
OF IGNITIONS. A FEW YEARS AGO.

02:21:03.221 --> 02:21:05.456
I HAD. SUGGESTED I THINK THE

02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:08.293
CALTRANS THAT MAYBE WE MANDATE

02:21:08.359 --> 02:21:09.594
THAT THESE KINDS APPROVAL AT

02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:11.062
LEAST HAVE TO HAVE A SMALL FIRE

02:21:11.129 --> 02:21:12.463
EXTINGUISHER WHICH ARE VERY

02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:14.432
INEXPENSIVE. YOU KNOW PURCHASE

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:15.667
ANY HOME DEPOT AND I WAS TOLD

02:21:15.733 --> 02:21:17.268
THAT THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH

02:21:17.335 --> 02:21:17.836
SOURCES OF IGNITION AND THAT

02:21:17.902 --> 02:21:19.637
MAYBE. YOU KNOW SOMETHING TO

02:21:19.704 --> 02:21:20.638
LOOK INTO BUT MAYBE THEY

02:21:20.705 --> 02:21:21.306
WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO USE

02:21:21.372 --> 02:21:22.740
THEM BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU

02:21:22.807 --> 02:21:24.742
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT.

02:21:24.809 --> 02:21:25.777
WHETHER THAT COULD BE SOMETHING

02:21:25.844 --> 02:21:27.745
THAT WOULD BE USEFUL- YOU KNOW

02:21:27.812 --> 02:21:28.746
TO SAY YOU KNOW MY- MY

02:21:28.813 --> 02:21:29.547
HUSBAND'S A LANDSCAPE

02:21:29.614 --> 02:21:30.582
CONTRACTOR AND IT'S SOMETHING

02:21:30.648 --> 02:21:31.850
HE'S ALWAYS WONDERED BECAUSE

02:21:31.916 --> 02:21:33.518
YOU KNOW WE SEE THESE GUYS KIND

02:21:33.585 --> 02:21:34.052
OF WORKING UP IN THE WHOLE

02:21:34.118 --> 02:21:35.386
SIDES ALL THE TIME. WITH

02:21:35.453 --> 02:21:37.255
CHAINSAWS FOR INSTANCE IN THE

02:21:37.322 --> 02:21:38.756
MIDDLE OF SUMMER. AND IT JUST

02:21:38.823 --> 02:21:40.291
SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW OBVIOUS

02:21:40.358 --> 02:21:42.460
RISK FOR SOME KIND OF IGNITION

02:21:42.527 --> 02:21:45.129
AND- IF YOU SEEN ENOUGH OF THAT

02:21:45.196 --> 02:21:45.730
THAT YOU THINK THIS IS AN AREA

02:21:45.797 --> 02:21:50.034
WORTH LOOKING INTO. THAT'S A

02:21:50.101 --> 02:21:52.337
GREAT QUESTION AND- I WOULD

02:21:52.403 --> 02:21:54.772
START BY FIRST- AGAIN NOTING

02:21:54.839 --> 02:21:57.075
THAT. WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY

02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:58.776
TRYING TO PREVENT EVERY SINGLE

02:21:58.843 --> 02:22:00.178
IGNITION WERE ONLY TRYING TO

02:22:00.245 --> 02:22:02.747
PREVENT. THE THAT LITERALLY THE

02:22:02.814 --> 02:22:04.249
10% OF THE IGNITIONS THAT

02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:06.951
OCCUR. DURING WIND EVENTS THAT

02:22:07.018 --> 02:22:08.987
WILL BECOME CATASTROPHIC FIRES.

02:22:09.053 --> 02:22:11.089
SO WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN ROAD

02:22:11.155 --> 02:22:12.590
SIDES. AND WE HAVE TO DO

02:22:12.657 --> 02:22:14.425
LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE. AND HAS

02:22:14.492 --> 02:22:15.994
TO OCCUR SOMETIME. IF IT

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:19.364
OCCURS- IN MAY IF IT OCCURS

02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:21.966
EVEN IN JUNE OR SOMETIMES EVEN

02:22:22.033 --> 02:22:24.269
JULY WHEN THERE'S NO WINS. THEN

02:22:24.335 --> 02:22:27.005
IF A FIRE IS STARTED. ARE AT

02:22:27.071 --> 02:22:27.605
LEAST OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT IN

02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:30.275
ORANGE COUNTY- IS EXTREMELY

02:22:30.341 --> 02:22:32.210
WELL RESOURCE TO GET ON THOSE

02:22:32.277 --> 02:22:33.845
IGNITIONS REALLY QUICKLY AND

02:22:33.912 --> 02:22:35.513
KEEP THEM FROM BECOMING. MAJOR

02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:39.017
FIRES. SO IF YOU IF YOU REALIZE

02:22:39.083 --> 02:22:39.717
THAT. THEN YOU CAN START

02:22:39.784 --> 02:22:41.352
THINKING ABOUT. SHOULD WE

02:22:41.419 --> 02:22:43.888
REALLY BE DOING MAINTENANCE ON

02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:46.024
ROADSIDES DURING WIND EVENTS.

02:22:46.090 --> 02:22:47.725
PROBABLY NOT. SHOULD WE REALLY

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:49.193
BE DOING LANDSCAPING WITH CHAIN

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:51.429
SAWS OR METAL BLADED WEED

02:22:51.496 --> 02:22:53.364
WACKER. DURING WIND EVENTS.

02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:56.534
PROBABLY NOT. AND SO. THAT IS

02:22:56.601 --> 02:22:58.169
WHERE YOU CAN FOCUS. THE

02:22:58.236 --> 02:23:00.638
EFFORT. I KNOW THAT DISTRICT

02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:02.140
TWELVE IN PARTICULAR- OF

02:23:02.206 --> 02:23:03.675
CALTRANS HAS. MADE SOME

02:23:03.741 --> 02:23:06.778
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. TO THEIR-

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:08.513
MAINTENANCE POLICIES AND

02:23:08.579 --> 02:23:12.216
PRACTICES RECENTLY- TO IMPROVE-

02:23:12.283 --> 02:23:14.786
OR REDUCE THE- THE CHANCES FOR

02:23:14.852 --> 02:23:16.220
ROADSIDE IGNITION. AND THEY'VE

02:23:16.287 --> 02:23:17.655
ALSO WORKED WITH THE ORANGE

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:19.190
COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY AGAIN IT

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:21.092
WAS YOU KNOW. OF THIS PLATFORM

02:23:21.159 --> 02:23:23.361
OF COAST. AND TO DO SOME

02:23:23.428 --> 02:23:25.396
TRAINING OF THEIR CREW SAID

02:23:25.463 --> 02:23:26.230
THAT THEY DO KNOW HOW TO USE A

02:23:26.297 --> 02:23:27.665
FIRE EXTINGUISHER. WHEN IT'S

02:23:27.732 --> 02:23:29.400
ISSUED TO THEM. THE TRICKY

02:23:29.467 --> 02:23:33.304
PART. IS IT ONLY TAKES ONE

02:23:33.371 --> 02:23:35.440
SPARK. DURING THE WINDOW VENT.

02:23:35.506 --> 02:23:37.575
TO CAUSE THAT PROBLEM. AND SO

02:23:37.642 --> 02:23:40.244
WE CAN'T. MAKE A MISTAKE DURING

02:23:40.311 --> 02:23:43.715
THAT TIME. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO

02:23:43.781 --> 02:23:46.551
SAY WELL WE'VE IMPROVED OUR OUR

02:23:46.617 --> 02:23:48.720
PRACTICES WHEN WE LET DOWN OUR

02:23:48.786 --> 02:23:50.722
GUARD ONE TIME WE HAD A MAJOR

02:23:50.788 --> 02:23:52.924
FIRE IN ORANGE COUNTY OVER A

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.258
DECADE OR SO AGO MAYBE EVEN

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:55.560
MORE THAN THAT AND IT WAS

02:23:55.626 --> 02:23:57.595
SOMEONE WHO LIVED OUT IN THE

02:23:57.662 --> 02:23:59.897
WILD LAND AREA- AND WAS

02:23:59.964 --> 02:24:02.400
WELDING. DURING A WIND EVENT

02:24:02.467 --> 02:24:03.968
JUST DECIDED TO GO OUT AND WELD

02:24:04.035 --> 02:24:05.269
IN HIS BACKYARD DURING THAT

02:24:05.336 --> 02:24:07.005
TIME AND HE SPARKED OFF A VERY

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:08.840
LARGE FIRE AND IT WAS ONE

02:24:08.906 --> 02:24:12.076
MISTAKE THAT CAUSED IT. SO

02:24:12.143 --> 02:24:13.344
AGAIN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:15.313
FIRES JUST DIDN'T OCCUR

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.681
HISTORICALLY IN THE SYSTEM

02:24:16.748 --> 02:24:18.016
THEIR WORK THE SOURCES OF

02:24:18.082 --> 02:24:19.784
IGNITIONS THAT THEY HAVE NOW.

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:21.786
AND IF WE IF BUT BUT WE DON'T

02:24:21.853 --> 02:24:24.188
HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THEM-

02:24:24.255 --> 02:24:26.124
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR

02:24:26.190 --> 02:24:27.492
PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL WE CAN'T

02:24:27.558 --> 02:24:29.260
PREVENT EVERY IGNITION WE DON'T

02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:30.928
NEED TO PREVENT EVERY NATION WE

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:32.130
JUST NEED TO PREVENT THE ONES

02:24:32.196 --> 02:24:33.197
THAT ARE GOING TO BECOME.

02:24:33.264 --> 02:24:35.233
CATASTROPHIC FIRES THANK YOU

02:24:35.299 --> 02:24:36.934
THAT IS VERY THAT'S REALLY

02:24:37.001 --> 02:24:38.569
INTERESTING AND I THINK VERY

02:24:38.636 --> 02:24:40.571
ELIMINATING- THANK YOU. AND ONE

02:24:40.638 --> 02:24:41.272
OTHER THING I'LL SAY IT'S

02:24:41.339 --> 02:24:42.640
REALLY JUST AN OBSERVATION SO

02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:44.809
BASED ON SOMETHING YOU SAID

02:24:44.876 --> 02:24:45.443
ABOUT THINKING RETHINKING SOME

02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:46.044
OF THE FIRE BREAKS IN THESE

02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:47.845
AREAS. BECAUSE WEN YOU REMOVE

02:24:47.912 --> 02:24:48.913
ALL THE PLANTINGS YOU GET THE

02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:50.415
NATIVE GRASSES AND IT'S I MEAN

02:24:50.481 --> 02:24:51.682
THEY'RE THE NON NATIVE GRASSES

02:24:51.749 --> 02:24:54.385
AND IT'S VERY HARD TO. TO KIND

02:24:54.452 --> 02:24:56.487
OF. OVERCOME THAT AND TO USE

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:59.557
THE NATIVE PLANTS- AS A AS A

02:24:59.624 --> 02:25:01.059
DIFFERENT KIND OF FIRE BREAK-

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:02.160
SOMETHING I'VE OBSERVED ALSO IS

02:25:02.226 --> 02:25:03.995
EVERY YEAR OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT

02:25:04.062 --> 02:25:06.197
FOR INSTANCE SENDS OUT. THE

02:25:06.264 --> 02:25:07.565
DEFENSIBLE SPACE NOTICES AS

02:25:07.632 --> 02:25:09.367
THEY SHOULD AND PEOPLE TEND TO

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:10.802
INTERPRET THAT AS- THAT MEANS I

02:25:10.868 --> 02:25:11.736
NEED TO GO OUT AND CUT

02:25:11.803 --> 02:25:13.337
EVERYTHING OFF MY WHOLE SIDE.

02:25:13.404 --> 02:25:14.572
THROUGH THE CYCLE OF HOMEOWNERS

02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:16.607
GOING OUT AND HIRING AN

02:25:16.674 --> 02:25:18.476
EDUCATED CREWS TO CLEAR CUT

02:25:18.543 --> 02:25:19.911
EVERYTHING OFF THE HILL THE

02:25:19.977 --> 02:25:20.912
NEXT TIME IT RAINS THE HILL

02:25:20.978 --> 02:25:26.184
COLLAPSES INTO THE STREET. I.

02:25:26.250 --> 02:25:26.784
THE VERY LEAST THERE'S NOTHING

02:25:26.851 --> 02:25:28.219
LEFT TO. AFTER THAT. BUT AN

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:29.387
AMBER. AND THOSE PEOPLE'S

02:25:29.454 --> 02:25:31.722
HOMES. SO DOING BETTER

02:25:31.789 --> 02:25:33.391
EDUCATION ABOUT WHAT DEFENSIBLE

02:25:33.458 --> 02:25:34.292
SPACE REALLY MEANS ANY

02:25:34.358 --> 02:25:35.760
IMPORTANT HAPPENED PORTENTS OF

02:25:35.827 --> 02:25:37.528
HAVING A LIVE PLANT MATERIAL.

02:25:37.595 --> 02:25:38.729
AND THE APPROPRIATE PLANT

02:25:38.796 --> 02:25:39.831
MATERIAL WHICH ARE OFTEN

02:25:39.897 --> 02:25:42.800
NATIVES. IN THESE AREAS. IS

02:25:42.867 --> 02:25:43.367
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE WE

02:25:43.434 --> 02:25:44.802
SHOULD FOCUS MUCH MORE ON AND

02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:46.604
PUT A LOT MORE RESOURCES IN.

02:25:46.671 --> 02:25:48.306
BECAUSE WE'RE SENDING THE WRONG

02:25:48.372 --> 02:25:49.507
MESSAGE OUT. YOU KNOW I

02:25:49.574 --> 02:25:50.741
KNOWINGLY PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:52.210
FOCUSED ENOUGH TO DO THE DEEP

02:25:52.276 --> 02:25:54.278
DIVE INTO THE RESEARCH INTO IT.

02:25:54.345 --> 02:25:55.213
SO THEY KIND OF DO WHAT THEY

02:25:55.279 --> 02:25:56.647
THINK TEY'RE BEING TOLD AND

02:25:56.714 --> 02:25:58.750
IT'S THE WRONG THING. SO IT'S

02:25:58.816 --> 02:25:59.951
NOT A QUESTION BUT JUST

02:26:00.017 --> 02:26:00.651
SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE

02:26:00.718 --> 02:26:02.620
SHOULD ALL TRY TO. MAYBE WORK

02:26:02.687 --> 02:26:03.354
WITH OUR COMMUNITY IS A LITTLE

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:04.989
BIT BETTER AND I. YOU MAY NOT

02:26:05.056 --> 02:26:06.157
HAVE THAT IN MR MULLINS IN YOUR

02:26:06.224 --> 02:26:08.159
AREA BUT IN MY ARE IN SOUTHERN

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:09.794
CALIFORNIA THIS IS A COMMON.

02:26:09.861 --> 02:26:12.163
KIND OF. MISTAKE THAT. PEOPLE

02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:14.398
MAKE IT IT'S REALLY. MAKING OUR

02:26:14.465 --> 02:26:15.800
COMMUNITIES LESS RESILIENT TO

02:26:15.867 --> 02:26:17.435
FIRES NOT NOT MORE SO AND TO

02:26:17.502 --> 02:26:19.437
OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS. LIKE

02:26:19.504 --> 02:26:21.706
LANDSLIDES AND IT'S JUST A- I

02:26:21.772 --> 02:26:23.274
WAS JUST A PERPETUATING CYCLE

02:26:23.341 --> 02:26:24.308
OF PEOPLE SEE THEIR NEIGHBORS

02:26:24.375 --> 02:26:25.042
TO AND THAT'S THEY THINK

02:26:25.109 --> 02:26:26.244
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DOING IT

02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:26.844
AND NO ONE'S REALLY CORRECTING

02:26:26.911 --> 02:26:30.581
THEM. GIVE MS GARCIA HAS

02:26:30.648 --> 02:26:32.950
QUESTIONS- YES I THANK YOU FOR

02:26:33.017 --> 02:26:34.919
YOUR PRESENTATION- THE FIRST

02:26:34.986 --> 02:26:37.255
QUESTION IS ABOUT THE EDUCATION

02:26:37.321 --> 02:26:39.123
OUT RICHARD DOING TO.

02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:41.425
INDIVIDUALS ARE WE TALKED A LOT

02:26:41.492 --> 02:26:42.827
ABOUT CALTRANS. AND THE ROADS

02:26:42.894 --> 02:26:43.961
AND THINGS THAT WE GET TO THE

02:26:44.028 --> 02:26:45.630
FROM THE GOVERNMENT SIDE THE

02:26:45.696 --> 02:26:46.898
CAN YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT

02:26:46.964 --> 02:26:49.667
ABOUT THE EDUCATION THAT YOU'VE

02:26:49.734 --> 02:26:50.268
BEEN DOING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:26:50.334 --> 02:26:51.269
ARE IN THESE FIRE PRONE AREAS

02:26:51.335 --> 02:26:53.137
AROUND NGUYEN EPISODES AND

02:26:53.204 --> 02:27:03.281
WHAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL THERE.

02:27:03.347 --> 02:27:06.584
SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO

02:27:06.651 --> 02:27:08.719
MUCH MY ORGANIZATION DOESN'T

02:27:08.786 --> 02:27:10.054
DIRECTLY DO EDUCATION WITH

02:27:10.121 --> 02:27:12.056
INDIVIDUALS BUT THEY'RE ALL OF

02:27:12.123 --> 02:27:13.057
THE PARTICIPATING

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:15.426
ORGANIZATIONS. IN COAST A LOT

02:27:15.493 --> 02:27:16.294
OF THEM ARE MUNICIPAL

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.628
GOVERNMENTS THAT DO EDUCATION

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:19.197
WITH THEIR RESIDENTS- THE

02:27:19.263 --> 02:27:20.798
ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY IN

02:27:20.865 --> 02:27:21.799
THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS DO A

02:27:21.866 --> 02:27:24.669
LOT OF. OF EDUCATION AS WELL I

02:27:24.735 --> 02:27:26.370
THINK THE MAIN THING THAT

02:27:26.437 --> 02:27:29.273
PEOPLE. HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:31.709
RESIDENTS TO REALIZE IS THAT WE

02:27:31.776 --> 02:27:33.744
OFTEN THINK ABOUT. THE

02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:35.413
EMERGENCY STARTING WHEN THE

02:27:35.479 --> 02:27:38.082
FIRE BREAKS OUT. BUT IN FACT

02:27:38.149 --> 02:27:39.850
THE EMERGENCY IS ACTUALLY WHEN

02:27:39.917 --> 02:27:41.385
THE WIND STARTS BLOWING BECAUSE

02:27:41.452 --> 02:27:43.754
THAT'S WHEN THE RISK. BECOMES

02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:46.824
UP IRRETRIEVABLE IF YOU HAVE AN

02:27:46.891 --> 02:27:50.161
IGNITION AND SO- FOR EXAMPLE

02:27:50.228 --> 02:27:53.030
THE- THE CALTRANS AND THE-

02:27:53.097 --> 02:27:54.832
ORANGE COUNTY- TOLL ROAD

02:27:54.899 --> 02:27:58.002
AGENCY. USE THEIR SIGNS THEY'RE

02:27:58.069 --> 02:28:00.338
THERE FOR. THEIR LIGHT UP SIGNS

02:28:00.404 --> 02:28:01.872
ALONG ROADWAYS DURING RED FLAG

02:28:01.939 --> 02:28:04.075
WARNINGS TO. EDUCATE MOTORISTS

02:28:04.141 --> 02:28:06.677
ABOUT THAT- AND THEN THERE OF

02:28:06.744 --> 02:28:07.945
PROGRAMS LIKE I MENTIONED LIKE

02:28:08.012 --> 02:28:10.114
READY SET GO. THAT THE ORANGE

02:28:10.181 --> 02:28:12.516
COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY HAS- BUT

02:28:12.583 --> 02:28:14.018
I DO THINK HAVING SAID ALL OF

02:28:14.085 --> 02:28:15.853
THAT. THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A

02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:18.522
LOT MORE EDUCATION BOTH EVENT

02:28:18.589 --> 02:28:20.992
BASED. MESSAGING WHICH ARE

02:28:21.058 --> 02:28:22.560
DESCRIBED AS THERE'S A THERE'S

02:28:22.627 --> 02:28:26.364
A WIND COMING- AND LONG TERM

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:27.765
MESSAGING WHICH IS. HOW DO YOU

02:28:27.832 --> 02:28:29.567
HARDEN YOUR HOME HOW DO YOU-

02:28:29.634 --> 02:28:30.701
YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE

02:28:30.768 --> 02:28:32.703
THAT YOU DON'T DO THINGS THAT.

02:28:32.770 --> 02:28:34.872
ENCOURAGE A FIRE HOW DO WE AS A

02:28:34.939 --> 02:28:36.907
COMMUNITY REDUCE THE RISK OF

02:28:36.974 --> 02:28:40.611
FIRE SO THERE'S A LOT MORE TO

02:28:40.678 --> 02:28:42.179
BE DONE IN THE EDUCATION REALM.

02:28:42.246 --> 02:28:44.415
THANK YOU AND THEN I KNOW THAT

02:28:44.482 --> 02:28:46.450
HE LEFT US WITH. THE LINGERING

02:28:46.517 --> 02:28:48.419
LEFT UP WITH FIGURING OUT HOW

02:28:48.486 --> 02:28:50.788
TO FIND THE WORK IN THE

02:28:50.855 --> 02:28:52.223
PLANNING THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING

02:28:52.290 --> 02:28:54.525
I DO THIS COAST. DO YOU HAVE

02:28:54.592 --> 02:28:57.161
ANY IDEAS OF. HOW THEY NEEDS TO

02:28:57.228 --> 02:28:59.196
BE DONE OR HOW THAT WILL BE

02:28:59.263 --> 02:29:05.002
DONE. IN THE LEAD TO PRESS. ONE

02:29:05.069 --> 02:29:06.737
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:29:06.804 --> 02:29:07.905
LOOKING AT IT AT LEAST IN

02:29:07.972 --> 02:29:10.207
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THAT-

02:29:10.274 --> 02:29:11.776
LOT OF THE COUNTIES ARE

02:29:11.842 --> 02:29:13.311
ACTUALLY CONTRACT COUNTIES TO

02:29:13.377 --> 02:29:15.546
CALIFORNICA FIRE. DOESN'T

02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:17.381
ACTUALLY OPERATE IN IN ORANGE

02:29:17.448 --> 02:29:18.549
COUNTY THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE

02:29:18.616 --> 02:29:20.484
AUTHORITY IS THE CONTRACT OF

02:29:20.551 --> 02:29:22.119
THE ALREADY AND I KNOW THE SAME

02:29:22.186 --> 02:29:24.322
IN LA. I BELIEVE IN TORRANCE

02:29:24.388 --> 02:29:25.990
SANTA BARBARA THEY'RE ONLY SIX

02:29:26.057 --> 02:29:27.992
CONTRACT COUNTIES IN- IN

02:29:28.059 --> 02:29:29.894
CALIFORNIA I KNOW MORAN IS ONE

02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:31.028
OF THEM BUT MOST OF THEM HAPPEN

02:29:31.095 --> 02:29:32.463
TO BE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:29:32.530 --> 02:29:36.467
AND I THINK ACTUALLY THE- PART

02:29:36.534 --> 02:29:37.768
OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS

02:29:37.835 --> 02:29:39.637
THAT THE ENTIRE WILD FIRE

02:29:39.704 --> 02:29:42.139
APPARATUS IF YOU WILL- HAS BEEN

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:44.008
BUILT AROUND THIS IDEA OF

02:29:44.075 --> 02:29:46.344
FOREST FIRES AND CONVENTIONAL-

02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:48.479
APPROACHES TO. BOTH FIRE

02:29:48.546 --> 02:29:50.348
MANAGEMENT AND FIRE PREVENTION

02:29:50.414 --> 02:29:51.816
AND A LOT OF THE WORK IS BEING

02:29:51.882 --> 02:29:55.686
DONE ON THE GROUND. AND SO-

02:29:55.753 --> 02:29:59.323
FUNDING LOCAL AUTHORITIES LIKE

02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:01.325
THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE

02:30:01.392 --> 02:30:03.728
AUTHORITY TO DO FIRE PREVENTION

02:30:03.794 --> 02:30:05.529
WORK THAT IS THE RESULT OF

02:30:05.596 --> 02:30:09.100
COLLABORATIVE. DEVELOPMENT

02:30:09.166 --> 02:30:10.868
WOULD BE WOULD BE ONE WAY TO DO

02:30:10.935 --> 02:30:12.903
IT I THINK THE SOLUTIONS ARE

02:30:12.970 --> 02:30:14.572
OUR LOCAL AND THEIR REGIONAL

02:30:14.638 --> 02:30:16.440
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY

02:30:16.507 --> 02:30:18.542
STATEWDE. TO BE REAL HONEST I

02:30:18.609 --> 02:30:21.545
DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HOW THE

02:30:21.612 --> 02:30:22.813
BUDGET WORKS TO BE ABLE TO

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.915
SUGGEST SOME SPECIFIC. FUNDING

02:30:24.982 --> 02:30:27.151
SOURCES BUT I WILL TELL YOU ONE

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:31.055
THING- AND THE PREVIOUS.

02:30:31.122 --> 02:30:33.391
SPEAKER MENTIONED IT IS THAT

02:30:33.457 --> 02:30:36.127
THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF VALUE

02:30:36.193 --> 02:30:37.461
IN DOING FIRE PREVENTION

02:30:37.528 --> 02:30:39.263
PARTICULARLY IN THE WIND.

02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:42.733
DRIVEN SYSTEMS- WHERE- YOU CAN

02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:44.769
PREVENT A FIRE THAT MAY COST

02:30:44.835 --> 02:30:47.004
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO

02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:48.973
SUPPRESS WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY

02:30:49.039 --> 02:30:52.042
WRITTEN A BLANK CHECK. FOR FIRE

02:30:52.109 --> 02:30:53.477
SUPPRESSION IN CATASTROPHIC

02:30:53.544 --> 02:30:55.179
FIRES AS WE PROBABLY SHOULD I'M

02:30:55.246 --> 02:30:57.047
NOT ARGUING WITH THAT BUT WE

02:30:57.114 --> 02:31:00.151
HAVEN'T INVESTED THE VERY VERY

02:31:00.217 --> 02:31:01.352
SMALL AMOUNT OF HIGHLY LEVERAGE

02:31:01.419 --> 02:31:02.987
FUNDING IN FIRE PREVENTION TO

02:31:03.053 --> 02:31:04.922
PREVENT THAT AND IN THIS CASE I

02:31:04.989 --> 02:31:06.457
WOULD SAY THAT IT AN OUNCE OF

02:31:06.524 --> 02:31:08.626
PREVENTION IS WORTH. PROBABLY A

02:31:08.692 --> 02:31:10.094
TON OF CARE IN THIS IN THIS

02:31:10.161 --> 02:31:15.766
CASE. THE THREAT. THANK YOU

02:31:15.833 --> 02:31:18.469
THANK YOU FOR JUST FOR THE

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.671
DEBIT OF THE QUESTION. BUT

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:21.338
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

02:31:21.405 --> 02:31:23.874
PRESENTATION THIS WAS VERY

02:31:23.941 --> 02:31:24.608
INFORMATIVE AS MY COLLEAGUES

02:31:24.675 --> 02:31:26.944
HAVE SAID. AND I ALSO THINK THE

02:31:27.011 --> 02:31:28.879
PRIOR SPEAKER AND I WANT TO ASK

02:31:28.946 --> 02:31:31.682
YOU ALSO. IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:34.084
ABOUT WIND. AND WE'RE TALKING

02:31:34.151 --> 02:31:35.753
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THESE ARE

02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:38.622
THINGS THAT WE CANNOT CONTROL.

02:31:38.689 --> 02:31:41.792
SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:44.361
THE PREVENTION AND THE PLANNING

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:46.096
JUST AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED HERE.

02:31:46.163 --> 02:31:50.201
WHAT ZONING OR PLANNING PULP

02:31:50.267 --> 02:31:52.970
POLICIES DO YOU FEEL WOULD BE

02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:56.207
HELPFUL. IF A STAKEHOLDERS

02:31:56.273 --> 02:31:58.142
COMMITTEE IS PUT TOGETHER WHO

02:31:58.209 --> 02:31:59.643
ARE THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO SHOULD

02:31:59.710 --> 02:32:01.812
BE PART OF THAT AND AS I

02:32:01.879 --> 02:32:03.747
MENTIONED IN THE PRIOR WITH THE

02:32:03.814 --> 02:32:05.883
PRIOR SPEAKER SHOULD THIS BE A

02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:07.651
FIVE YEAR PLAN A TEN YEAR PLAN

02:32:07.718 --> 02:32:09.920
WE NEED SOLUTIONS TODAY BUT WE

02:32:09.987 --> 02:32:11.622
ALSO NEED TO PLAN. FOR THE

02:32:11.689 --> 02:32:17.428
FUTURE. SO WHAT WHAT WOULD WHAT

02:32:17.495 --> 02:32:18.496
WHAT WE THINK YOU I'M GLAD YOU

02:32:18.562 --> 02:32:20.130
ASKED ME THAT BECAUSE I WAS. I

02:32:20.197 --> 02:32:20.631
WAS WANTING TO ANSWER IT

02:32:20.698 --> 02:32:25.402
EARLIER. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS A

02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:26.937
COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS WITH

02:32:27.004 --> 02:32:28.105
REGARD TO CLIMATE CHANGE

02:32:28.172 --> 02:32:29.406
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

02:32:29.473 --> 02:32:31.375
CLIMATE CHANGE BEING SORT OF

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:32.810
THE PROBLEM AND BEING THE

02:32:32.877 --> 02:32:34.912
DRIVER OF A LOT OF THIS IT

02:32:34.979 --> 02:32:37.681
TURNS OUT THAT- AT LEAST WITH

02:32:37.748 --> 02:32:39.283
REGARD TO WIND DRIVEN FIRES

02:32:39.350 --> 02:32:41.051
IT'S THE WIND THAT WILL ALWAYS

02:32:41.118 --> 02:32:42.853
BE THE PROBLEM CLIMATE CHANGE

02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:45.456
MAY MAKE IT WORSE IT MAY MAKE

02:32:45.523 --> 02:32:47.525
IT RATHER THAN EIGHTEEN TO

02:32:47.591 --> 02:32:48.526
TWENTY FOUR DAYS A YEAR OF

02:32:48.592 --> 02:32:51.161
WINDOWS VENTS IT MAY MAKE IT

02:32:51.228 --> 02:32:51.762
TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX DAYS

02:32:51.829 --> 02:32:53.264
OF WIND OFFENSE THEY MIGHT BE

02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:55.699
STRONGER WE DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT

02:32:55.766 --> 02:32:57.668
I WOULD SAY IS WITH REGARD TO

02:32:57.735 --> 02:32:59.336
THE SOLUTIONS THEY STILL REMAIN

02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:00.671
THE SAME. WHETHER YOU'RE

02:33:00.738 --> 02:33:02.606
PREVENTING IGNITIONS EIGHTEEN

02:33:02.673 --> 02:33:04.008
DAYS A YEAR OR THIRTY DAYS A

02:33:04.074 --> 02:33:05.075
YEAR IT'S STILL ABOUT

02:33:05.142 --> 02:33:07.011
PREVENTING IGNITIONS AND SO

02:33:07.077 --> 02:33:09.046
THAT IS WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:33:09.113 --> 02:33:10.114
AND ONE OF THE REASONS I HAVE

02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:12.016
SOME HOPE IS THAT UNLIKE A LOT

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:14.084
OF OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS

02:33:14.151 --> 02:33:15.586
HURRICANES EARTHQUAKES TO NAME

02:33:15.653 --> 02:33:18.489
A COUPLE- THIS IS A PREVENTABLE

02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:21.058
PROBLEM IF WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:33:21.125 --> 02:33:22.092
DO IT AND IF WE ALL WORK

02:33:22.159 --> 02:33:24.628
TOGETHER AND SO I THINK THE

02:33:24.695 --> 02:33:26.096
WHAT YOU MENTIONED STAKEHOLDERS

02:33:26.163 --> 02:33:28.032
I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO

02:33:28.098 --> 02:33:30.034
BE AT THE TABLE ARE THE ONES

02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:32.970
WHO HAVE A ARE ARE RESPONSIVE

02:33:33.037 --> 02:33:34.538
TO THIS AND SHARE SOME OF THE

02:33:34.605 --> 02:33:36.540
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRE

02:33:36.607 --> 02:33:38.075
PROBLEM AND WE'RE REALLY

02:33:38.142 --> 02:33:40.778
FOCUSED. ON THE FIRE PREVENTION

02:33:40.844 --> 02:33:43.013
PART OF THAT WITH REGARD TO

02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:44.715
PLANNING ALL I'LL JUST SAY THIS

02:33:44.782 --> 02:33:47.518
ABOUT THAT WHICH IS- I DO THINK

02:33:47.585 --> 02:33:49.787
WE NEED TO STOP BUILDING IN

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:50.354
AREAS THAT ARE HIGHLY FIRE

02:33:50.421 --> 02:33:52.890
PRONE THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY

02:33:52.957 --> 02:33:55.759
SENSE TO PUT NEW COMMUNITIES

02:33:55.826 --> 02:33:58.128
OUT IN AREAS EVEN IF THEIR FIRE

02:33:58.195 --> 02:33:59.663
HARDENED IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY

02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:01.398
SENSE TO DO THAT BUT EVEN IF WE

02:34:01.465 --> 02:34:04.568
NEVER BUILT ANOTHER HOUSE OUT

02:34:04.635 --> 02:34:07.371
IN THE IN THE FUTURE IN THE

02:34:07.438 --> 02:34:09.540
FIRE PRONE WILDLANDS THE RECENT

02:34:09.607 --> 02:34:11.342
ESTIMATE OF THE HOUSES THAT ARE

02:34:11.408 --> 02:34:13.210
VULNERABLE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE

02:34:13.277 --> 02:34:15.179
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AS WE

02:34:15.245 --> 02:34:17.715
BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND AMBER CAST

02:34:17.781 --> 02:34:19.416
AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

02:34:19.483 --> 02:34:22.553
WENT FROM. JUST OVER THREE

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:23.153
HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES TO ALL

02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:25.089
OVER THREE MILLION HOMES.

02:34:25.155 --> 02:34:26.924
NOTHING CHANGED OTHER THAN OUR

02:34:26.991 --> 02:34:28.459
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE RISK

02:34:28.525 --> 02:34:31.929
WAS AND SO WE HAVE A HUGE HUGE

02:34:31.996 --> 02:34:33.464
NUMBER OF HOMES THAT ARE

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:36.133
ALREADY AT RISK. EVEN IF WE

02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:37.668
DON'T DO ANYMORE BUILDING IN

02:34:37.735 --> 02:34:38.602
THE WILDLANDS WHICH I DON'T

02:34:38.669 --> 02:34:40.938
THINK W SHOULD DO. SO WE'VE

02:34:41.005 --> 02:34:42.773
GOT TO WORK ON THOSE

02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:43.807
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY

02:34:43.874 --> 02:34:46.477
THERE. AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:34:46.543 --> 02:34:47.978
ADDRESS NOT ONLY THE FIRE FRONT

02:34:48.045 --> 02:34:49.713
WHICH IS PEOPLE'S TRADITIONAL

02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:51.582
CONCEPTION OF- IF WE STOP THE

02:34:51.649 --> 02:34:53.250
FIRE FRONT THEN WE'LL STOP THE

02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:56.654
PROBLEM. NO IN FACT WHEN YOUR-

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:58.656
FIRE IS THROWING EMBERS AND

02:34:58.722 --> 02:35:01.458
BRANDS FIVE MILES DOWN WIND AND

02:35:01.525 --> 02:35:05.029
LIGHTING HOMES ON FIRE. ON THE

02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:05.562
OTHER SIDE OF A TEN LANE

02:35:05.629 --> 02:35:08.499
FREEWAY. THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT

02:35:08.565 --> 02:35:10.467
IS REALLY HUGE AND I THINK WE

02:35:10.534 --> 02:35:12.770
DO HAVE THE RIGHT STAKEHOLDERS

02:35:12.836 --> 02:35:15.906

02:42:46.723 --> 02:42:49.025
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. OF

02:42:49.092 --> 02:42:51.928
FROM OREGON TO MEXICO FROM THE

02:42:51.995 --> 02:42:55.632
BEACHES TO THE DESERT. IT CAN

02:42:55.699 --> 02:42:59.069
BE ANYWHERE ANYTIME- AND IT MAY

02:42:59.136 --> 02:43:02.038
BE FUELS IT MAY BE- FUELS AND

02:43:02.105 --> 02:43:05.342
WIND- IT MAY BE TOPOGRAPHY

02:43:05.408 --> 02:43:07.511
DRIVEN FIRES THAT OCCUR BUT

02:43:07.577 --> 02:43:08.845
FIRES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN

02:43:08.912 --> 02:43:11.248
THROUGHOUT THE STATE EVERY YEAR

02:43:11.314 --> 02:43:12.048
AND I THINK SOME OF THE

02:43:12.115 --> 02:43:14.684
PREVIOUS- SPEAKERS TALKS TO THE

02:43:14.751 --> 02:43:16.586
MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. AND THIS

02:43:16.653 --> 02:43:18.622
IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO EXPECT

02:43:18.688 --> 02:43:23.293
IN THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT

02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:25.362
CERTAIN POPULATIONS IN OUR

02:43:25.428 --> 02:43:26.696
STATE ARE PARTICULARLY

02:43:26.763 --> 02:43:29.566
VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRE THREATS.

02:43:29.633 --> 02:43:31.801
CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS DO LIVE

02:43:31.868 --> 02:43:34.237
IN WILDLAND INTERMENT INTERMIX

02:43:34.304 --> 02:43:37.574
AND WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE

02:43:37.641 --> 02:43:39.843
SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS WE

02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:43.180
WEEK- AND THOSE AREAS ARE ARE

02:43:43.246 --> 02:43:46.316
PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE- YOU

02:43:46.383 --> 02:43:48.985
HAVE. LOTS OF VEGETATION TYPES

02:43:49.052 --> 02:43:52.122
MIXED IN WITH- WITH-

02:43:52.189 --> 02:43:55.425
DEVELOPMENT- AND THAT IS A

02:43:55.492 --> 02:43:58.161
RECIPE FOR CONCERN AND WE HAVE

02:43:58.228 --> 02:44:01.865
METHODS AND- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

02:44:01.932 --> 02:44:03.400
THAT CAN HELP US TO REDUCE

02:44:03.466 --> 02:44:05.535
THOSE THREATS AND CONCERNS ONE

02:44:05.602 --> 02:44:07.404
OF THOSE IS OF COURSE-

02:44:07.470 --> 02:44:10.106
DEFENSIBLE SPACE- AS WELL AS

02:44:10.173 --> 02:44:12.075
HOME HARDENING- AND THEN FUEL

02:44:12.142 --> 02:44:14.211
REDUCTION PROJECT WORK ON THE

02:44:14.277 --> 02:44:16.413
PERIMETER TO- HEARTENED

02:44:16.479 --> 02:44:18.648
COMMUNITIES AGAINST- AMBER

02:44:18.715 --> 02:44:22.519
CAST. AND THEN THERE FOR A

02:44:22.586 --> 02:44:25.121
REDUCING THEIR THREAT THE ALSO

02:44:25.188 --> 02:44:28.692
I MEAN ALSO CITIES ARE NOT- OUT

02:44:28.758 --> 02:44:31.595
OF THE WOODS EITHER- WE HAVE

02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:35.799
EXAMPLES OF OAKLAND REDDING

02:44:35.865 --> 02:44:40.704
SANTA ROSA MANY MORE AND THOSE

02:44:40.770 --> 02:44:42.806
ARE AREAS THAT OR PRETTY HIGHLY

02:44:42.872 --> 02:44:45.208
URBANIZED IN MANY AREAS- AND

02:44:45.275 --> 02:44:46.876
THAT ARE ALSO VERY MUCH

02:44:46.943 --> 02:44:48.445
VULNERABLE TO THE SAME KIND OF

02:44:48.511 --> 02:44:50.947
STE- SITUATIONS THAT CAN OCCUR

02:44:51.014 --> 02:44:54.017
WHEN WE HAVE WILDLAND FIRES- OF

02:44:54.084 --> 02:44:56.086
ANY TYPE IN ANY SIZE DURING THE

02:44:56.152 --> 02:44:57.687
WRONG KIND OF. WEATHER

02:44:57.754 --> 02:45:00.323
CONDITIONS. ADAPTING TO

02:45:00.390 --> 02:45:02.859
WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA'S DRY

02:45:02.926 --> 02:45:04.794
MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE REQUIRES.

02:45:04.861 --> 02:45:07.330
SYSTEMATIC ALL OF THE ABOVE

02:45:07.397 --> 02:45:10.333
TYPES OF APPROACHES. THIS MEANS

02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:14.337
THAT WE NEED TO IDENTIFY AND-

02:45:14.404 --> 02:45:17.374
AND MAP FIRE HAZARD ZONES

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:21.411
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE NEED TO

02:45:21.478 --> 02:45:22.879
PROTECT NEIGHBORHOODS AND

02:45:22.946 --> 02:45:24.648
COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRE

02:45:24.714 --> 02:45:27.617
THROUGHOUT THE LANDS LANDSCAPE.

02:45:27.684 --> 02:45:29.819
THROUGH LANDSCAPE SCALE FUEL

02:45:29.886 --> 02:45:32.622
REDUCTION AND FORESTRY- TYPES

02:45:32.689 --> 02:45:37.160
OF PROJECTS. WE NEED PLANNING

02:45:37.227 --> 02:45:40.330
PLANNING AND COMMUNITIES- THAT

02:45:40.397 --> 02:45:43.700
PLAN FOR RESILIENT- GREEN BELTS

02:45:43.767 --> 02:45:47.404
AND- AND FUEL REDUCTION AROUND

02:45:47.470 --> 02:45:49.539
THOSE COMMUNITIES AS A MENTIONS

02:45:49.606 --> 02:45:51.107
TO REDUCE THAT AMBER CAST AND

02:45:51.174 --> 02:45:54.377
INTENSITY OF FIRE AS IT COMES

02:45:54.444 --> 02:45:56.980
CLOSER AND CLOSER TO STRUCTURES.

02:45:57.047 --> 02:45:58.948
WE NEED TO ENSURE COMMUNITIES

02:45:59.015 --> 02:46:02.018
HAVE PROPER EVACUATION ROUTES

02:46:02.085 --> 02:46:05.021
WATER SUPPLIES AND FIRE

02:46:05.088 --> 02:46:07.190
PROTECTION RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:46:07.257 --> 02:46:09.492
ASSOCIATED AND IN THOSE

02:46:09.559 --> 02:46:10.860
COMMUNITIES BOTH SPEAKERS

02:46:10.927 --> 02:46:12.429
PREVIOUS TO ME TALKED ABOUT A

02:46:12.495 --> 02:46:13.730
LOT OF THOSE ISSUES AND THOSE

02:46:13.797 --> 02:46:17.200
ARE THINGS THAT. THAT CAN HELP

02:46:17.267 --> 02:46:18.601
IN THE PREVENTION OF FIRES AS

02:46:18.668 --> 02:46:22.005
WELL NOT ONLY BE IN THE

02:46:22.072 --> 02:46:24.107
RESPONSE TO FIRES. THE BUILDING

02:46:24.174 --> 02:46:26.309
HOMES OUT OF EMBER RESISTANT

02:46:26.376 --> 02:46:29.512
MATERIALS WHILE MAINTAINING A

02:46:29.579 --> 02:46:30.113
HUNDRED FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE

02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:33.016
ZONES- BY REMOVING DEAD AND THE

02:46:33.083 --> 02:46:35.051
DEAD AND DOWN OVERGROWN

02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:37.320
VEGETATION IS ALSO CRITICAL

02:46:37.387 --> 02:46:39.155
TOTALLY AGREE WITH NOT MOVES

02:46:39.222 --> 02:46:41.858
GAPING- A DEFENSIBLE SPACE

02:46:41.925 --> 02:46:44.227
AREA. I THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE

02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:45.762
TALKING ABOUT THAT IS NOT WHAT

02:46:45.829 --> 02:46:48.498
THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE- IT IS

02:46:48.565 --> 02:46:52.335
A HEALTHY LANDSCAPE AND DOES-

02:46:52.402 --> 02:46:55.772
ALLOW FOR NATIVE PLANTS AND

02:46:55.839 --> 02:46:58.441
FIRE RESILIENT PLANTS TO BE IN

02:46:58.508 --> 02:47:02.746
THAT MIX. ONE LAST SPARK IS

02:47:02.812 --> 02:47:04.047
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND

02:47:04.114 --> 02:47:06.549
THERE'S A CAMPAIGN- AND ONE

02:47:06.616 --> 02:47:08.518
SPARK CAN BE ONE TOO MANY ONE

02:47:08.585 --> 02:47:10.220
LESS COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE

02:47:10.286 --> 02:47:12.322
BETWEEN A CATASTROPHIC

02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:18.495
SITUATION AND- AND- NOT. IT IS

02:47:18.561 --> 02:47:21.030
IMPORTANT FOR IT TO UNDERSTAND

02:47:21.097 --> 02:47:23.266
THAT NO INDIVIDUAL TASK OR

02:47:23.333 --> 02:47:27.337
PROGRAM IS A SILVER BULLET. I

02:47:27.404 --> 02:47:29.439
BELIEVE I BELIEVE FOR THE

02:47:29.506 --> 02:47:32.175
PREVIOUS- SPEAKERS ALSO TALKED

02:47:32.242 --> 02:47:34.844
TO THIS- THIS IS NOT AN EASY

02:47:34.911 --> 02:47:39.048
PROBLEM TO FIX. AND EACH OF

02:47:39.115 --> 02:47:40.717
THESE EFFORTS WORKS IN

02:47:40.784 --> 02:47:42.285
CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER TO

02:47:42.352 --> 02:47:44.020
PREVENT AND PROTECT AGAINST

02:47:44.087 --> 02:47:48.358
WILDFIRES. EACH WITH EACH. IT

02:47:48.425 --> 02:47:50.326
REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN

02:47:50.393 --> 02:47:52.929
THE TOOLBOX THAT MUST BE

02:47:52.996 --> 02:47:55.265
ADAPTED TO THE USED IN A

02:47:55.331 --> 02:47:57.767
PARTICULAR SETTING- AND WEATHER

02:47:57.834 --> 02:47:59.402
PATTERNS VEGETATION TYPES

02:47:59.469 --> 02:48:00.804
TOPOGRAPHY AND IN THE BUILT

02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:04.107
ENVIRONMENT WHAT THIS MEANS IS-

02:48:04.174 --> 02:48:07.644
WE NEED TO DO AS PRACTITIONERS-

02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:09.045
WE NEED TO HAVE ALL OF THE

02:48:09.112 --> 02:48:11.514
TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX AVAILABLE

02:48:11.581 --> 02:48:19.756
TO US TO TUNE THE ABILITY. TO

02:48:19.823 --> 02:48:22.492
IN THAT OVERTIME IN SOME CASES

02:48:22.559 --> 02:48:23.726
THAT WILL BE MORE EFFORT AND

02:48:23.793 --> 02:48:27.130
HOME HARDENING AND LESS IN FOR

02:48:27.197 --> 02:48:29.432
FOREST MANAGEMENT- IN OTHER

02:48:29.499 --> 02:48:31.234
AREAS IT WILL BE OPPOSITE OF

02:48:31.301 --> 02:48:33.770
THAT OF BASED ON BUILDING

02:48:33.837 --> 02:48:34.904
CONSTRUCTION THAT ALREADY IS IN

02:48:34.971 --> 02:48:37.407
PLACE BUT BASED ON WHAT THE

02:48:37.474 --> 02:48:39.242
VEGETATION TYPES ARE THAT ARE

02:48:39.309 --> 02:48:42.412
IN THE- NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

02:48:42.479 --> 02:48:45.548
THAT SURROUNDS. WELL IT'S TRUE

02:48:45.615 --> 02:48:48.384
THAT FIRES CAN BE DRIVEN. BY

02:48:48.451 --> 02:48:51.020
STATE BY CERTAIN FEATURES LIKE%

02:48:51.087 --> 02:48:54.257
TO RAIN WIND FUELS- OUR BEST

02:48:54.324 --> 02:48:55.825
STRATEGY IS TO PREVENT

02:48:55.892 --> 02:48:57.627
CATASTROPHIC. TO PREVENT

02:48:57.694 --> 02:49:00.029
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES TO USE

02:49:00.096 --> 02:49:02.832
EVERY APPROPRIATE TOOL- EIGHT

02:49:02.899 --> 02:49:05.435
TO THE ADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE-

02:49:05.502 --> 02:49:07.504
AND THAT INCLUDES MAINTENANCE A

02:49:07.570 --> 02:49:11.174
ONCE WE HAVE THAT SYSTEM OF-

02:49:11.241 --> 02:49:13.710
PROTECTION IN PLACE. FIRES RE

02:49:13.776 --> 02:49:17.380
DYNAMIC HI I JUST FOR A COUPLE

02:49:17.447 --> 02:49:23.386
OF EXAMPLES- IN A- THEY CAN BE.

02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:25.788
DOMINATED BY WIND AT ONE POINT

02:49:25.855 --> 02:49:28.191
ONE POINT AND THEN BY FUELS AT

02:49:28.258 --> 02:49:30.994
ANOTHER POINT- THEY CAN BE

02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:32.862
START OUT AS FUELS FIRES THEY

02:49:32.929 --> 02:49:34.731
COULD START OUT A SMALL GRASS

02:49:34.797 --> 02:49:37.400
FIRES- THEY COULD TURN INTO

02:49:37.467 --> 02:49:40.169
WIND DRIVEN FIRES OR REMAIN

02:49:40.236 --> 02:49:44.107
FUELS FIRES OR IN SOME CASES-

02:49:44.173 --> 02:49:45.575
ACTUALLY BECOME CLING DOMINATED

02:49:45.642 --> 02:49:48.611
FIRES WERE STARTING TO SEE THAT.

02:49:48.678 --> 02:49:51.281
OFTEN THE NOT WHERE A FUEL ST

02:49:51.347 --> 02:49:55.685
FIRE. THE AGENT OWN WEATHER AND

02:49:55.752 --> 02:49:57.854
WE AND THEN IT BECOMES A WIN

02:49:57.921 --> 02:50:00.123
DRIVEN FIRE ONLY TO THE FOLLOW

02:50:00.189 --> 02:50:02.792
MORNING MANY MANY TURNED BACK

02:50:02.859 --> 02:50:05.962
INTO A FUEL FOR. SO THERE IS NO

02:50:06.029 --> 02:50:10.667
SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS- AN

02:50:10.733 --> 02:50:13.403
EXAMPLE OF A- DOMINATED FIRE-

02:50:13.469 --> 02:50:15.071
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE

02:50:15.138 --> 02:50:17.206
CREEK FIRE I'M SORRY NOT TO

02:50:17.273 --> 02:50:20.577
CREDITS TO RECENT THE CAMPFIRE.

02:50:20.643 --> 02:50:24.380
AGAIN NOW. IT WAS A CAMPFIRE

02:50:24.447 --> 02:50:30.386
CAN'T ENDS IN. SAN DIEGO THAT I

02:50:30.453 --> 02:50:33.289
HAD A PLUME DOMINATED EPISODE

02:50:33.356 --> 02:50:34.891
THAT PUT UP A PYROTECHNIC

02:50:34.958 --> 02:50:37.327
BUBBLE THAT FLOATED ABOUT TWO

02:50:37.393 --> 02:50:38.528
THIRDS OF THE WAY ACROSS THE

02:50:38.595 --> 02:50:40.797
UNITED STATES BEFORE IT-

02:50:40.863 --> 02:50:43.833
DISSIPATED- THAT WAS- IN A

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:50.273
CHAPARRAL. DOMINATED ECOSYSTEM

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:54.143
WE FIRES IN IT IN KIND OF THE

02:50:54.210 --> 02:50:56.212
HOPE WOULD LEAD. GRASS INTERMIX

02:50:56.279 --> 02:51:00.283
CHAPARRAL SYSTEM- JUST

02:51:00.350 --> 02:51:02.986
RECENTLY- ASK THE- S. U.

02:51:03.052 --> 02:51:06.022
COMPLEX- HENRICO STATE PARK

02:51:06.089 --> 02:51:08.224
ALMOST THE ENTIRE STATE PARK

02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:11.427
BURNED UP IN THAT. EVENT I'M

02:51:11.494 --> 02:51:13.229
GONNA SAY THAT OUT THERE IS A

02:51:13.296 --> 02:51:15.331
LOT OF GOOD FIRE THAT OCCURRED

02:51:15.398 --> 02:51:18.001
ON THEIR- THE TRAGIC THING IS

02:51:18.067 --> 02:51:19.068
THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY

02:51:19.135 --> 02:51:21.337
STRUCTURES THAT WERE DESTROYED-

02:51:21.404 --> 02:51:26.209
IN IN THAT EVENT AS WELL. BUT

02:51:26.275 --> 02:51:30.380
IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF- CHAPARRAL-

02:51:30.446 --> 02:51:33.716
FIRE BURNING IN NON WIND

02:51:33.783 --> 02:51:36.819
CONDITIONS- TO THE TUNE OF

02:51:36.886 --> 02:51:38.321
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES

02:51:38.388 --> 02:51:41.691
AND YES THERE WAS GRASS IN THE

02:51:41.758 --> 02:51:43.326
MIX THERE WAS OAK WITH AND I

02:51:43.393 --> 02:51:44.727
LITTLE BIT OF CONNOR FOR HERE

02:51:44.794 --> 02:51:46.929
AND THERE- BUT A LOT OF THAT

02:51:46.996 --> 02:51:49.699
FIRE WAS IN FACT. CHAPARRAL

02:51:49.766 --> 02:51:56.439
TYPE- COASTAL AND. HARD

02:51:56.506 --> 02:52:00.610
CHAPARRAL TYPE. FUELS BUYERS BY

02:52:00.677 --> 02:52:06.683
WIND THIS HAPPENS- IN A IN

02:52:06.749 --> 02:52:10.820
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. A ALSO HOW

02:52:10.887 --> 02:52:11.654
IN CALIFORNIA THIS AND IT

02:52:11.721 --> 02:52:12.689
REALLY DEPENDS ON WHEN THE FIRE

02:52:12.755 --> 02:52:16.592
STARTS- WINDOW CAN BE SOMETHING

02:52:16.659 --> 02:52:18.761
THAT HELPS WITH THE IGNITION OF

02:52:18.828 --> 02:52:21.964
A FIRE IN THE EVENT OF POWER

02:52:22.031 --> 02:52:25.968
SUPPLY SPARKING DUE TO HIGH

02:52:26.035 --> 02:52:27.737
WINDS SLAPPING THE LINES

02:52:27.804 --> 02:52:30.139
TOGETHER OR- BREAKING THE

02:52:30.206 --> 02:52:35.478
LINES- BUT IT ALSO CAN CAUSE-

02:52:35.545 --> 02:52:40.316
IN IN OTHER CASES- A CONDITION

02:52:40.383 --> 02:52:42.251
OF OTHER TYPES- A LOT OF

02:52:42.318 --> 02:52:44.721
LIBERAL ELECTRICAL- SOME OF

02:52:44.787 --> 02:52:48.658
THEM ARE ARSON- BUT MANY ARE

02:52:48.725 --> 02:52:50.560
JUST PEOPLE DOING WHAT THEY

02:52:50.626 --> 02:52:53.262
THINK IS A GOOD THING OR NOT

02:52:53.329 --> 02:52:54.764
THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT

02:52:54.831 --> 02:52:55.598
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THINKING

02:52:55.665 --> 02:52:57.567
ABOUT. THERE'S AN EDUCATION

02:52:57.633 --> 02:52:59.702
OPPORTUNITY- THAT SPARKS OF

02:52:59.769 --> 02:53:01.471
FIRE AND THEN THE WIND CARRIES

02:53:01.537 --> 02:53:03.172
IT FASTER THAN THEY CAN DO THAT

02:53:03.239 --> 02:53:04.807
THEN THEY CAN PUT IT OUT RIGHT

02:53:04.874 --> 02:53:10.813
NEAR THERE- THEM CHAU EVERY AN

02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:12.582
EXAMPLE OF A FIRE THAT I WANTED

02:53:12.648 --> 02:53:13.950
TO BRING UP WAS THE CRANSTON

02:53:14.016 --> 02:53:17.887
FIRE IN. IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY-

02:53:17.954 --> 02:53:20.890
THAT FIRE BURNED UP SLOPE AND

02:53:20.957 --> 02:53:25.962
WITH THE WIND TO- IDYLLWILD AND

02:53:26.028 --> 02:53:27.797
AS IT. ENCROACHED UPON

02:53:27.864 --> 02:53:30.399
IDYLLWILD IT IMPACTED A FUEL

02:53:30.466 --> 02:53:31.834
BREAK THAT HAD BEEN PUT IN THE

02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:33.970
CHAPARRAL AROUND THE- THE

02:53:34.036 --> 02:53:37.673
FRENCH OF IDYLLWILD AT THE KIND

02:53:37.740 --> 02:53:39.675
OF CHANGES THE TRANS. FROM

02:53:39.742 --> 02:53:43.212
FROM- CHAPARRAL INTO- KIND OF

02:53:43.279 --> 02:53:47.950
SCATTERED- PINE TREES AND- MORE

02:53:48.017 --> 02:53:50.153
IF MANZANITA TYPE. OF THAT FIRE

02:53:50.219 --> 02:53:52.722
GLANCED OFF OF THAT AND WAS WAS

02:53:52.789 --> 02:53:54.557
ABLE TO BE HELD ON THE EDGE OF

02:53:54.624 --> 02:53:56.125
THAT WITH MINIMAL STRUCTURE

02:53:56.192 --> 02:53:59.362
LOST. AND OUT OF A SHOOT THAT

02:53:59.428 --> 02:54:00.763
WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE FIRE

02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:03.299
DIRECTLY IN THE IDYLLWILD AND

02:54:03.366 --> 02:54:06.068
TAKEN OUT THE CENTER OF TOWN-

02:54:06.135 --> 02:54:08.137
THAT IS THAT IS ONE PLACE WHERE

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:10.339
WE HAVE VERY MUCH VERY

02:54:10.406 --> 02:54:12.675
RECENTLY. USED A FUEL BREAK

02:54:12.742 --> 02:54:14.577
THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR

02:54:14.644 --> 02:54:17.180
APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY

02:54:17.246 --> 02:54:22.118
YEARS- AND MAINTAINED- AND IT

02:54:22.185 --> 02:54:22.718
SAVES THE TOWN OF IDYLLWILD.

02:54:22.785 --> 02:54:24.053
THE THOMAS FIRES ANOTHER

02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:26.956
EXAMPLE OF- WHERE FUEL

02:54:27.023 --> 02:54:32.428
REDUCTION- BOTH IN- FIRES THAT

02:54:32.495 --> 02:54:32.995
HAD OCCURRED PREVIOUSLY BUT

02:54:33.062 --> 02:54:36.666
ALSO BURNS AND FUEL REDUCTION

02:54:36.732 --> 02:54:38.901
WORK THAT HAD BEEN DONE BY- A

02:54:38.968 --> 02:54:43.039
VENTURA COUNTY FIRE- AND EVEN

02:54:43.105 --> 02:54:46.676
INTO SANTA BARBARA- THE THOMAS

02:54:46.742 --> 02:54:49.946
FIRE DID REDUCE IN INTENSITY

02:54:50.012 --> 02:54:54.684
AND- WAS- RENDERED-

02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:56.752
CONTROLLABLE IN AREAS

02:54:56.819 --> 02:54:58.821
PARTICULARLY ON THE FLANKS AND

02:54:58.888 --> 02:55:00.223
THE HEEL OF THE FIRE THAT'S

02:55:00.289 --> 02:55:02.024
THAT. THAT'S THE RIGHT SIDE

02:55:02.091 --> 02:55:04.527
LEFT SIDE AND THE BACK OF THE

02:55:04.594 --> 02:55:06.863
FIRE AS A AS A FIRE IS RUNNING

02:55:06.929 --> 02:55:09.165
WITH THE WIND AWAY FROM YOU.

02:55:09.232 --> 02:55:11.701
AND JUST FOR PERSPECTIVE-

02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:14.003
OFTENTIMES VERY MUCH IN THE

02:55:14.070 --> 02:55:16.405
FIRST PHASE OF A WILDFIRE UNDER

02:55:16.472 --> 02:55:19.408
WINDY CONDITIONS ABOUT 90% OF

02:55:19.475 --> 02:55:22.245
THE FIRE PERIMETER IS ACTUALLY

02:55:22.311 --> 02:55:24.046
VERY MUCH AFFECTED BY FUEL

02:55:24.113 --> 02:55:26.949
REDUCTION PROJECTS- AND BY

02:55:27.016 --> 02:55:28.718
REDUCED FUELS WHETHER IT'S OUR

02:55:28.784 --> 02:55:32.488
PREVIOUS WILDFIRE. A ROAD-

02:55:32.555 --> 02:55:35.558
EIGHTY- TRAIL AND SOME CASES

02:55:35.625 --> 02:55:37.927
THOSE THAT 90% OF THE FILE FIRE

02:55:37.994 --> 02:55:42.064
DOES HAVE- IT DOES ACT REACT.

02:55:42.131 --> 02:55:44.066
POSITIVELY MEANING IT'S REDUCED

02:55:44.133 --> 02:55:46.702
OR IT STOPS- BECAUSE THE WINDS

02:55:46.769 --> 02:55:47.536
BLOWING IN THE OPPOSITE

02:55:47.603 --> 02:55:49.538
DIRECTION THAT WIND DRIVEN

02:55:49.605 --> 02:55:51.007
PORTION OF THE FIRE IS

02:55:51.073 --> 02:55:52.108
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:55:52.174 --> 02:55:54.010
CONTEND WITH AND THAT'S WHERE

02:55:54.076 --> 02:55:54.877
WE DEFINITELY NEED A WHOLE

02:55:54.944 --> 02:55:58.481
SYSTEM. OF REDUCING AMBER CAST-

02:55:58.547 --> 02:56:00.483
REDUCING INTENSITY OF FIRE AS

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:02.151
IT COMES INTO A COMMUNITY

02:56:02.218 --> 02:56:04.687
HAVING A NON CONDUCT NON-

02:56:04.754 --> 02:56:08.090
IMMEDIATELY COMBUSTIBLE- IT'S

02:56:08.157 --> 02:56:10.660
URIEL IN AND AROUND THE

02:56:10.726 --> 02:56:12.061
STRUCTURE AREA AND THEN A

02:56:12.128 --> 02:56:13.863
HARDENED HOME ONCE WE HAVE THAT

02:56:13.930 --> 02:56:16.832
SYSTEM IN PLACE- THEN WE HAVE

02:56:16.899 --> 02:56:19.468
AN OPPORTUNITY TO. USE THESE

02:56:19.535 --> 02:56:24.173
OTHER. FEATURES TO HERC FIRES A-

02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:25.808
AT THROUGH COMMUNITY IN AND

02:56:25.875 --> 02:56:27.410
THAT IN A MATTER THAT THAT WILL

02:56:27.476 --> 02:56:30.179
BE- PUT US IN A PLACE WHERE

02:56:30.246 --> 02:56:32.181
WE'RE LIVING WITH WILDFIRE AS

02:56:32.248 --> 02:56:33.849
OPPOSED TO LIVING AGAINST

02:56:33.916 --> 02:56:39.255
WILDFIRE. SO ALL OF THE ABOVE-

02:56:39.322 --> 02:56:43.059
IN SOME OF THE NOTES THAT- DR

02:56:43.125 --> 02:56:47.496
JENSEN- PROVIDED FROM NEED TO

02:56:47.563 --> 02:56:49.732
THINK PLAN SOCIETY- YOU TALKED

02:56:49.799 --> 02:56:52.301
ABOUT- HAVING ALL OF THE TOOLS

02:56:52.368 --> 02:56:56.205
IN THE TOOLBOX AVAILABLE- FOR-

02:56:56.272 --> 02:56:58.908
THE PLAN COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT-

02:56:58.975 --> 02:57:01.444
ALSO I BELIEVE FOR THAT'S

02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:02.979
IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY

02:57:03.045 --> 02:57:07.316
RESILIENCE AND FUEL REDUCTION.

02:57:07.383 --> 02:57:10.152
MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD AND

02:57:10.219 --> 02:57:14.757
I. WANT TO STOP SHORT OF TRYING

02:57:14.824 --> 02:57:18.027
TO BRING THIS TO A ONE OR TWO

02:57:18.094 --> 02:57:24.100
OPTIONS- THIS IS THIS ISN'T. A

02:57:24.166 --> 02:57:24.734
VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM IT MOTHER

02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:29.205
NATURE ON ITS SIDE- WE THE ONLY

02:57:29.271 --> 02:57:30.673
THING THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE

02:57:30.740 --> 02:57:32.708
ABLE TO DO IS DEVELOP

02:57:32.775 --> 02:57:35.344
SYSTEMATIC APPROACHES THAT BEST

02:57:35.411 --> 02:57:38.314
HAVE THE CHANCE OF. REDUCING

02:57:38.381 --> 02:57:41.751
THE THREAT TO OUR COMMUNITIES-

02:57:41.817 --> 02:57:44.620
THROUGH. AB MARIETTA OPTIONS

02:57:44.687 --> 02:57:47.023
AND HAVING ALL OF THOSE

02:57:47.089 --> 02:57:48.290
INGREDIENTS ARE TOOLS IN THE

02:57:48.357 --> 02:57:52.795
TOOLBOX A READY TO GO AS WERE-

02:57:52.862 --> 02:57:54.296
IT DOING COLLABORATIVE PLANNING

02:57:54.363 --> 02:57:56.365
OF A PROJECT WORK AND I

02:57:56.432 --> 02:57:58.401
ABSOLUTELY AGREE- THE

02:57:58.467 --> 02:58:00.703
COLLABORATIVE PRINT PLANNING IS

02:58:00.770 --> 02:58:06.475
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY- ACTUALLY

02:58:06.542 --> 02:58:07.843
THE REGIONAL AIR SAFETY TO. FOR

02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:09.645
THAT WAS MEETING BEFORE I LEFT

02:58:09.712 --> 02:58:11.814
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I WAS THE

02:58:11.881 --> 02:58:14.283
CHAIR OF FOR ABOUT THREE AND A

02:58:14.350 --> 02:58:18.220
HALF YEARS AND- THAT WAS A BODY

02:58:18.287 --> 02:58:25.027
THAT SPAWNED INTO THE- COAST.

02:58:25.094 --> 02:58:27.463
AND MASSED IN THE MOUNTAIN

02:58:27.530 --> 02:58:28.531
AREAS THAT'S MOUNTAIN AREA

02:58:28.597 --> 02:58:30.966
SAFETY TASK FORCE AND FAST

02:58:31.033 --> 02:58:33.903
FOREST AREA SAFETY TASK FORCE-

02:58:33.969 --> 02:58:35.905
AND SO I'M VERY FAMILIAR AND

02:58:35.971 --> 02:58:38.674
VERY- APPRECIATIVE OF THOSE-

02:58:38.741 --> 02:58:40.443
EFFORTS AND THE COLLABORATION

02:58:40.509 --> 02:58:45.514
THAT GOES INTO- THOSE- TYPES OF

02:58:45.581 --> 02:58:50.119
PROGRAMS. SO THE- THE FOR THE I

02:58:50.186 --> 02:58:51.720
WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:58:51.787 --> 02:58:53.989
BEFORE COME TO QUESTIONS IS-

02:58:54.056 --> 02:58:56.725
ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS- AND I KNOW

02:58:56.792 --> 02:58:58.794
YOU'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH-

02:58:58.861 --> 02:59:02.531
HOW THE CCI FUNDS HAVE BEEN

02:59:02.598 --> 02:59:06.669
ALLOCATED- AND- THANK YOU L. A.

02:59:06.735 --> 02:59:08.604
O. FOR THAT ANALYSIS THAT WAS

02:59:08.671 --> 02:59:11.540
HELPFUL TO HEAR THIS MORNING-

02:59:11.607 --> 02:59:13.609
THE WE HAVE BASICALLY THREE

02:59:13.676 --> 02:59:16.178
PLACES THAT THOSE FUNDS- KIND

02:59:16.245 --> 02:59:19.281
OF. CIPHERIN INTO AND THEIR

02:59:19.348 --> 02:59:22.384
FIRE PREVENTION RANT AND FUELS

02:59:22.451 --> 02:59:24.954
WORK TYPE OF- PROJECTS AS WELL

02:59:25.020 --> 02:59:28.724
AS FOREST MANAGEMENT FOREST

02:59:28.791 --> 02:59:30.426
HEALTH MANAGEMENT. AND THEN

02:59:30.493 --> 02:59:33.362
THE- PIECES AND PARTS OF THE-

02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:36.532
SB NINE OH ONE AND THAT KIND OF

02:59:36.599 --> 02:59:42.238
HOLISTIC APPROACH TO- REDUCING-

02:59:42.304 --> 02:59:45.107
FIRE THREAT BUT ALSO INCREASING

02:59:45.174 --> 02:59:48.611
FOREST HEALTH. AND SO ALL OF

02:59:48.677 --> 02:59:52.014
THESE EFFORTSARE USED IN IN

02:59:52.081 --> 02:59:53.716
CONJUNCTION IN THAT ALL OF THE

02:59:53.782 --> 02:59:54.984
ABOVE APPROACH WE'VE GOT THAT

02:59:55.050 --> 02:59:57.686
DEEP WILDLAND ALL CALL IT WE'VE

02:59:57.753 --> 02:59:59.822
GOT THE INTERMIX AREAS WE'VE

02:59:59.889 --> 03:00:02.424
GOT THE FIRE DEFENSE-

03:00:02.491 --> 03:00:04.260
IMPROVEMENT AREAS AND THE

03:00:04.326 --> 03:00:06.896
DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND THEN WE

03:00:06.962 --> 03:00:08.864
NEED THAT FINAL PIECE THE HOME

03:00:08.931 --> 03:00:13.769
HARDENING REALLY- OF ARMOR THIS

03:00:13.836 --> 03:00:16.839
ENTIRE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO

03:00:16.906 --> 03:00:19.708
LIVING WITH WILDFIRE. AND SO

03:00:19.775 --> 03:00:22.411
PREVENT- THE PREVENTION PIECE

03:00:22.478 --> 03:00:24.513
IS REALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO WE

03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:27.716
REDUCE THAT THAT- THREAT OF

03:00:27.783 --> 03:00:30.052
FIRE IN AND AROUND THE

03:00:30.119 --> 03:00:34.290
COMMUNITY ITSELF. IN SOME CASES

03:00:34.356 --> 03:00:35.958
AROUND THE HOME. BUT THAT IS

03:00:36.025 --> 03:00:37.526
ACTUALLY THE HOMEOWNERS OF

03:00:37.593 --> 03:00:40.663
RESPONSIBILITY SO WE DO HAVE-

03:00:40.729 --> 03:00:42.731
PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH

03:00:42.798 --> 03:00:44.099
THOSE THAT ARE VULNERABLE THOSE

03:00:44.166 --> 03:00:45.734
THAT NEED IT FINANCIAL

03:00:45.801 --> 03:00:46.869
ASSISTANCE CAN'T DO THE WORK

03:00:46.936 --> 03:00:49.305
THEMSELVES- AND ARE GRANT

03:00:49.371 --> 03:00:51.674
PROGRAMS ADDRESS THAT- OUR

FOREST MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS-

03:00:54.543 --> 03:00:57.546
FORCED HEALTH. ARE TYPICALLY

03:00:57.613 --> 03:00:59.548
POINTED OUT LARGER LANDSCAPE

03:00:59.615 --> 03:01:02.451
LEVEL TREATMENTS AND INCREASING

THE HEALTH OF FORESTS- EIGHT

03:01:06.455 --> 03:01:07.756
WHILE REDUCING THE THREAT OF

03:01:07.823 --> 03:01:10.326
WILDFIRES TEARING THROUGH THOSE

03:01:10.392 --> 03:01:12.561
FORESTS AND BEING- TURNED INTO

03:01:12.628 --> 03:01:15.397
SMOKE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA NOW

03:01:15.464 --> 03:01:18.267
HAS IN THEIR LUNGS THAT IS THE

03:01:18.334 --> 03:01:23.505
INTENT THERE. THE COMBINATION

03:01:23.572 --> 03:01:26.875

ARE ALREADY WORKING VERY

03:08:42.611 --> 03:08:44.479
COLLABORATIVELY AND CLOSELY ON

03:08:44.546 --> 03:08:46.314
THESE- IT THESE TYPES OF

03:08:46.381 --> 03:08:48.717
ISSUES- AND WE HAVE BEEN

03:08:48.784 --> 03:08:51.186
WORKING DILIGENTLY- PARTLY

03:08:51.253 --> 03:08:54.222
THROUGH- REQUIREMENT- DURING

03:08:54.289 --> 03:08:55.691
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS WITH

PG&amp;E IN PARTICULAR BUT WITH ALL

03:08:58.393 --> 03:09:01.730
OF THE UTILITIES- ON. KIND OF

03:09:01.797 --> 03:09:04.032
WHAT WHAT WHAT THE NEXT PIECES

03:09:04.099 --> 03:09:06.902
ARE. THE UTILITIES HAVE A HUGE

03:09:06.968 --> 03:09:09.337
PART IN THIS IN THAT THEY ARE

03:09:09.404 --> 03:09:13.175
RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING A- A

03:09:13.241 --> 03:09:15.944
SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. OUR SYSTEM.

03:09:16.011 --> 03:09:19.047
AND SO. WE ON THE REGULATORY

03:09:19.114 --> 03:09:22.851
SIDE ARE LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE

03:09:22.918 --> 03:09:25.854
WE MAY NEED TO STRENGTHEN OR-

03:09:25.921 --> 03:09:29.124
CHANGED THOSE REGULATIONS. BUT

03:09:29.191 --> 03:09:31.126
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT

03:09:31.193 --> 03:09:31.860
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS

03:09:31.927 --> 03:09:35.363
SAFE- AND EFFECTIVE SYSTEM AND

03:09:35.430 --> 03:09:39.701
SO WHAT- WE DO HAVE A LOT OF

03:09:39.768 --> 03:09:41.303
RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE

03:09:41.369 --> 03:09:46.575
IN PLACE- IF THEY- ACT OF GOD

03:09:46.641 --> 03:09:50.445
TYPE OF INCIDENT HAPPENS- THEN

03:09:50.512 --> 03:09:53.215
ADD AND A UTILITY CAUSES A FIRE

03:09:53.281 --> 03:09:57.052
BASED ON THAT- THAT'S NOT

03:09:57.119 --> 03:09:59.955
NECESSARILY A NEGLIGENT FIRE.

03:10:00.021 --> 03:10:02.457
AND THEREFORE- THERE ARE PLACES

03:10:02.524 --> 03:10:04.359
WHERE WE HAVE FIRES THAT ARE

03:10:04.426 --> 03:10:05.160
CAUSED BY UTILITIES THAT ARE

03:10:05.227 --> 03:10:10.232
NOT- DUE TO- NEGLIGENT OR LACK

03:10:10.298 --> 03:10:15.303
OF- REGULATED- SPACE- WE NEED

03:10:15.370 --> 03:10:17.239
TO LOOK AT IT AS A AS AGAIN A

03:10:17.305 --> 03:10:19.741
HOLISTIC. APPROACH WE NEED TO

03:10:19.808 --> 03:10:23.044
LOOK AT WHAT THE WHAT THE-

03:10:23.111 --> 03:10:23.845
VEGETATION LOOKS LIKE IN AN

03:10:23.912 --> 03:10:26.882
UNDER- LINES THAT CAN-

03:10:26.948 --> 03:10:29.351
POTENTIALLY CAUSE FIRES- BUT WE

03:10:29.417 --> 03:10:33.021
ALSO NEED TO- INSURE THAT THOSE

03:10:33.088 --> 03:10:34.790
HARDENING THE INFRASTRUCTURE

03:10:34.856 --> 03:10:36.291
AND HARDENING OF THE ELECTRICAL

03:10:36.358 --> 03:10:38.360
SYSTEM. ARE OCCURRING AND WE

03:10:38.426 --> 03:10:40.562
ARE DOING THAT- THERE ARE

03:10:40.629 --> 03:10:43.765
THOUSANDS OF MILES AND HUNDREDS

03:10:43.832 --> 03:10:45.500
OF THOUSANDS OF POINTS OF

03:10:45.567 --> 03:10:47.969
CONTACT THAT NEED TO BE. LOOKED

03:10:48.036 --> 03:10:49.504
AT AND MAINTAINED BY THE

03:10:49.571 --> 03:10:52.140
UTILITIES- THEY ARE WORKING ON

03:10:52.207 --> 03:10:55.944
THAT- AND WE NEED TO HOLD THEM

03:10:56.011 --> 03:10:57.712
TO ACCOUNT AND- ADDS TO A

GOING TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT.

03:20:40.128 --> 03:20:43.197
WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MR

03:20:43.264 --> 03:20:44.198
CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MAKE ON

BEHALF OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO

03:20:45.867 --> 03:20:48.302
REDWOOD COMPANIES OF APPRECIATE

03:20:48.369 --> 03:20:49.904
THE TIME WILL BE VERY BRIEF-

03:20:49.971 --> 03:20:51.339
FIRST WE DID WANT TO APPLAUD

03:20:51.406 --> 03:20:53.374
THE STATE IN ITS- LEADERSHIP

03:20:53.441 --> 03:20:56.978
AND- EFFORTS. IN GHG EMISSION

03:20:57.044 --> 03:20:59.647
REDUCTIONS- HOWEVER WE THINK

03:20:59.714 --> 03:21:03.050
THAT WE'VE GOT TO. GIVE SERIOUS

03:21:03.117 --> 03:21:05.987
ATTENTION TO LAND AND FOREST

03:21:06.053 --> 03:21:08.356
MANAGEMENT IN THE STATE. AND WE

03:21:08.423 --> 03:21:10.892
HAVE THREE MAIN SUGGESTIONS- AT

03:21:10.958 --> 03:21:12.860
THIS POINT. THE FIRST IS WE

03:21:12.927 --> 03:21:15.062
THINK THAT WE NEED A SINGLE

03:21:15.129 --> 03:21:17.999
INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE WHO CAN

03:21:18.065 --> 03:21:21.235
FIRST DIRECT- AN ORGANIZED

03:21:21.302 --> 03:21:24.071
PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE. I

03:21:24.138 --> 03:21:28.009
CALIFORNIA HAS- STATED A POLICY

03:21:28.075 --> 03:21:31.679
OF TRYING TO- TREAT ABOUT FIVE

03:21:31.746 --> 03:21:32.380
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES IN THE

03:21:32.447 --> 03:21:35.316
STATE OF CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR.

03:21:35.383 --> 03:21:37.051
WITH OVER THIRTY THREE MILLION

03:21:37.118 --> 03:21:38.753
ACRES OF FOREST LAND IN THE

03:21:38.820 --> 03:21:41.489
STATE- ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT

03:21:41.556 --> 03:21:43.958
REALLY IS NOT GOING TO MAKE

03:21:44.025 --> 03:21:46.294
MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. SECOND WE

03:21:46.360 --> 03:21:48.296
THINK OF THAT WHILE FITTING IS

03:21:48.362 --> 03:21:50.097
A VERY IMPORTANT WE'RE GOING TO

03:21:50.164 --> 03:21:51.999
HAVE TO RE INTRODUCE PRESCRIBED

03:21:52.066 --> 03:21:55.102
FIRE. AND PART OF THAT REQUIRES

03:21:55.169 --> 03:21:58.306
A PROGRAM OF ESTABLISHING SOME

03:21:58.372 --> 03:22:00.541
LIMITS ON LIABILITY. ABSENT

03:22:00.608 --> 03:22:02.310
NEGLIGENCE OF COURSE TO SOME

03:22:02.376 --> 03:22:04.812
INSURABLE AMOUNT FOR THE

03:22:04.879 --> 03:22:06.948
LANDOWNER. AND THEN THE THIRD

03:22:07.014 --> 03:22:09.383
IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT BIOMASS

03:22:09.450 --> 03:22:11.152
WILL AND HAS TO PLAY AN

03:22:11.219 --> 03:22:14.021
IMPORTANT ROLE. IF WE DO I

03:22:14.088 --> 03:22:15.890
TREAT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

03:22:15.957 --> 03:22:18.259
THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR WHAT DO

03:22:18.326 --> 03:22:20.194
WE DO WITH THAT MATERIAL AND

03:22:20.261 --> 03:22:21.963
ESSENTIALLY YOU HAVE A CHOICE

03:22:22.029 --> 03:22:25.166

ACCORDING TO SOME STUDIES SUCH

03:22:33.107 --> 03:22:34.308
AS THE PLUMAS FAIR BOARD IT

03:22:34.375 --> 03:22:35.610

REDUCTION. IN A CAR BEEN IN

03:22:38.513 --> 03:22:41.983

WHICH AS YOU WELL. KNOW HAS

03:23:10.511 --> 03:23:11.078
RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF DOZENS

CHAIRPERSON BLOOM AND MEMBERS

03:25:23.144 --> 03:25:25.146
STAND SILVER ENDANGERED

03:25:25.212 --> 03:25:27.381
HABITATS LEAGUE. THE ELEPHANT

03:25:27.448 --> 03:25:29.483
IN THE ROOM IS LOCAL LAND USE

03:25:29.550 --> 03:25:31.185
EXPANSION OF NEW DEVELOPMENT

03:25:31.252 --> 03:25:33.254
INTO THE FIRE ZONE IS ONGOING

03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:35.056
MASSIVE AND RECKLESS STRUCTURES

03:25:35.122 --> 03:25:37.291
BUILT TWO NEW CODES BURN ANYWAY

03:25:37.358 --> 03:25:38.959
AND EVACUATION ROUTES ARE

03:25:39.026 --> 03:25:40.528
GRIDLOCK EVEN BEFORE THE FIRE

03:25:40.594 --> 03:25:44.131
STARTS. THE LEGISLATURE MUST

03:25:44.198 --> 03:25:46.400
SUMMON THE COURAGE TO LIMIT.

03:25:46.467 --> 03:25:48.069
LOCAL DISCRETION FOR NEW

03:25:48.135 --> 03:25:50.104
CONSTRUCTION IN THE FIRESTONE

03:25:50.171 --> 03:25:53.007
IT SHOULD DO THIS DIRECTLY. IT

03:25:53.074 --> 03:25:54.141
COULD DO IT INDIRECTLY IF THE

03:25:54.208 --> 03:25:57.111
STATE WOULD STOP SUBSIDIZING SO

03:25:57.178 --> 03:25:58.646
MUCH THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY

03:25:58.713 --> 03:26:00.147
AREAS WHICH ALLOW LOCAL

03:26:00.214 --> 03:26:02.216
GOVERNMENT TO AVOID THE

03:26:02.283 --> 03:26:04.452
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR

03:26:04.518 --> 03:26:06.954
RECKLESS DECISIONS. AND WHY IS

03:26:07.021 --> 03:26:08.923
THE STATE CONTINUING TO ISSUE

03:26:08.989 --> 03:26:11.525
SUBSIDIZE FAIR PLAN INSURANCE

03:26:11.592 --> 03:26:15.763
FOR NEW HOMES IN FIRE ZONES. MY

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:17.665
SECOND POINT IS THAT CALIFORNIA

03:26:17.732 --> 03:26:18.999
MUST BRING ITS VEGETATION

03:26:19.066 --> 03:26:20.901
TREATMENT PROGRAM IN SHRUBLANDS

03:26:20.968 --> 03:26:22.703
INTO THE MODERN ERA. ITS

03:26:22.770 --> 03:26:24.305
VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM

03:26:24.371 --> 03:26:26.107
WILL SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

03:26:26.173 --> 03:26:28.642
ON ACTIVE ON ACTIVITIES IT METS

03:26:28.709 --> 03:26:30.444
ARE INEFFECTIVE IN WIND DRIVEN

03:26:30.511 --> 03:26:32.513
FIRES IT IS THE WIND DRIVEN

03:26:32.580 --> 03:26:34.415
FIRES THAT CAUSE LOSS OF LIFE

03:26:34.482 --> 03:26:37.251
AND PROPERTY. A SIMPLE STEP IS

03:26:37.318 --> 03:26:38.652
TO MAKE CAL FIRE FOLLOW

03:26:38.719 --> 03:26:40.721
EXISTING LAW AND ACTUALLY

03:26:40.788 --> 03:26:44.592
ENFORCE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE

03:26:44.658 --> 03:26:45.159
FOUR FOUR EIGHT THREE WHOSE

03:26:45.226 --> 03:26:46.060
INTENT IS TO STOP TYPE

03:26:46.127 --> 03:26:47.428
CONVERSION OF CHAPARRAL TO

03:26:47.495 --> 03:26:50.231
FLAMMABLE WEEDS. THE VTP OF CAL

03:26:50.297 --> 03:26:52.500
FIRE SHOWS NO INTENTION OF

03:26:52.566 --> 03:26:54.502
FOLLOWINGSTATE LAW RATHER IT

03:26:54.568 --> 03:26:56.103
CALLS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

03:26:56.170 --> 03:26:57.471
OF ACRES TO BE CRITICALLY

03:26:57.538 --> 03:27:00.040
INJURED AND CONVERTED TO MORE

03:27:00.107 --> 03:27:01.742
FLAMMABLE VEGETATION. IF

03:27:01.809 --> 03:27:02.710
CALIFORNIA WOULD LIMIT

03:27:02.777 --> 03:27:05.045
TREATMENTS TO TIMES BEYOND THE

03:27:05.112 --> 03:27:07.214
NORMAL FIRE RETURN INTERVAL WE

03:27:07.281 --> 03:27:07.982
COULD GET A HANDLE ON THE

03:27:08.048 --> 03:27:10.284
