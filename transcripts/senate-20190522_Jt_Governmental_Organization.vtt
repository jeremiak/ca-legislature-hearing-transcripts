WEBVTT

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.375
IN MY OPINION OTHER SPORTS DON'T

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.544
HOLD A CANDLE TO THE SCRUTINY

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.645
THAT IS APPLIED TO RACING IN

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.880
CALIFORNIA.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.281
AND MOST OTHER RACING

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.750
JURISDICTIONS.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.218
LAST NIGHT TWENTY FOUR MAJOR

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:55.155
LEAGUE TEAMS PLAY BASEBALL GAMES.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.123
I STRONGLY DOUBT THAT THEY WIND

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.391
UP THE PLAYERS.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.627
IN A LINE AFTER THE GAME.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:03.329
AND SAID YOU YOU YOU AND YOU.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.764
WE NEED TESTS.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.100
HERE'S YOUR CUP.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.502
WE DO THAT AFTER EVERY RACE

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.440
EVERY DAY.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.074
OF COURSE OUR NEW SUBSTANCES

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.977
THAT MAY NOT YET BE DETECTABLE.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.312
IT TOOK YEARS BEFORE BARRY BONDS

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.347
AND LANCE ARMED ARMSTRONG WERE

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:21.581
CAUGHT.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.017
WERE CAUGHT.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.151
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THE MEDI

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.187
LAB KEEPS OUR SAMPLES FOR TWO

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:31.658
YEARS FOR RETROACTIVE TESTING.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.893
UNTIL NEW TESTS CAN BE DEVELOPED.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.328
OTHER SPORTS ARE MANAGED BY

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.963
LEGAL OFFICES.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.665
WE DON'T MANAGER RACING WE

IS THAT NOBODY WANTS REGULATION

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:20.012
UNTIL THERE'S A QUE QUE

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.313
CATASTROPHE.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.915

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.950
A BATTLE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.752
A BATTLE AND SOMETIMES -- ALE

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:27.820
DOESN'T HELP.

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:29.155
BUT REGARDLESS I DON'T THINK

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:37.149
THEY'RE ALL YOUNG EXERCISED

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:38.517
THOROUGHBRED HORSES SO BY

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:39.952
EXERCISED WE TRY TO KEEP THEM

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.054
FIT USING A COMBINATION --

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:44.223
EXERCISE REGIMEN INCLUDING HIGH

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.057
SPEED TREADMILL.

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:46.292
SO THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT TO AS

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:47.927
BEST WE CAN IN A CONTROLLED

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.094
RESEARCH CITING.

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:50.563
KIND OF MIMIC AT YOUR TYPICAL

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.132
RESOURCE.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.200
SO HAVING ACCESS TO THESE

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:55.568
ANIMALS AT ANY TIME ALLOWS US

00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:57.469
RESPOND LET US RESPOND VERY

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:59.305
QUICKLY TO EMERGING THREATS WE

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:00.639
CAN VERY QUICKLY ASSESS HOW

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:01.941
COMPOUNDS MOVE THROUGHOUT THE

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.442
ANIMAL SYSTEM WHERE THEY GO HOW

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:04.977
THEIR LIMITED.

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:06.912
THE PHARMACOLOGIC OR PHYSIOLOGIC

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:07.713
EFFECTS OF THESE DIFFERENT

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.648
COMPOUNDS AND PROBABLY MOST

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:10.816
IMPORTANTLY FROM A REGULATORY

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:12.818
SPECTRUM PERSPECTIVE WE CAN

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.386
DEVELOP AND VALIDATE SENSITIVE

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:15.988
ANALYTICAL METHODS THAT CAN THEN

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:16.789
BE USED AS PART OF THE

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:18.157
REGULATORY SCREEN SO WE

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:19.758
REGULARLY TRANSFER THESE METHODS

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:21.727
FROM THE RESEARCH ARM. TO THE

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.696
DRUG TESTING PORTION OF THE

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:24.597
PROGRAM.

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:25.764
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THE

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:27.132
PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY PROLIFIC

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.400
WE'VE PUBLISHED UPWARDS OF

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:29.535
NINETY MANUSCRIPTS IN PEER

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:30.970
REVIEW JOURNALS RELATED TO

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.638
EQUINE PHARMACOLOGY.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.106
THIS INFORMATION IS THEN USED BY

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:35.708
OTHER DRUG TESTING LABS BOTH

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:37.843
FROM A MYTHOLOGICAL STANDPOINT

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.144
AS WELL AS FROM.

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.512
A REGULATORY STANDPOINT IN TERMS

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:42.881
OF ESTABLISHING.

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:45.084
REGULATORY RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.719
THE LOCATION OF THE MADDIE LAB

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:48.487
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:49.521
MORE SPECIFICALLY AT THE SCHOOL%

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:51.323
OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ALSO

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.891
PROVIDES A NUMBER OF BENEFITS TO

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:53.959
OUR LAB.

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:55.461
SO BEING PART OF THE VETERINARY

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:57.763
SCHOOL ALLOWS US READY ACCESS TO

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.632
INDIVIDUALS WITH WITH EXPERTISE

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.000
IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS.

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:02.034
NOT ONLY DOES THIS INCLUDE

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:03.369
PHARMACOLOGY IN ANALYTICAL

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:05.804
CHEMISTRY BUT ORTHOPEDICS EQUINE

00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:08.240
GENETICS DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING AND

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.676
EACH EQUINE EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY.

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.444
SO WE FORMED MANY COLLABORATIONS

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:13.846
WITH THESE DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:15.314
ARE EXPERTS IN THESE FIELDS.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.017
AND THIS ALLOWS US -- TO PUSH

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:19.084
FORWARD WITH OUR RESEARCH AND

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:20.419
REALLY ADVANCE OUR RESEARCH

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:22.087
DEVELOP NEW ANALYTICAL

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:25.090
TECHNIQUES. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:25.858
IS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY

00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:27.626
COLLABORATING WITH AN EXPERT IN

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:29.461
EQUINE GENETICS TO DEVELOP A NEW

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:30.529
METHODOLOGY.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.864
THAT WE HOPE TO YOU USE IN THE

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.832
FUTURE TO AUGMENT OUR CURRENT

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.301
METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF THE

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:36.869
BLOOD DOPING AGENT OR A THREE

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:38.137
POINT IN.

00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:39.705
SO IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THIS NEW

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.273
METHODOLOGY WILL ENHANCE OUR

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.908
ABILITY TO DETECT ADMINISTRATION

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:45.110
OF MICRO DOSES OF IVO THROUGH

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:46.545
THE USE OF BIOMARKERS OF

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.280
ADMINISTRATION SO ALTERNATIVE

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:51.150
TECHNIQUES TO DETECTING DRUG

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:52.551
ADMINISTRATION.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:53.185
AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:53.986
TO BEING PART OF THE UNIVERSITY

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:55.554
AND THE SCHOOL OF THAT MAN AS WE

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:56.855
ARE ABLE TO USE THE UNIVERSITY'S

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.257
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADVANCE OUR

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.525
RESEARCH GOALS.

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:00.826
SO WE USE THE UNIVERSITY'S

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.394
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:03.662
USE COMMITTEE THEY REGULARLY

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:05.864
REVIEW ALL OF OUR ANIMAL STUDIES

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:07.299
ALL OF OUR PROTOCOLS.

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:08.701

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.769
HOUSE OUR HORSES THE TREADMILL

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.237
THAT'S LOCATED AT THE VET SCHOOL

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.340
AND THEN ALSO FACILITIES TO

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.541
CONDUCT RESEARCH STUDIES.

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:16.975
AND THEN LASTLY AS WELL AS BEING

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:18.377
PART OF THE VET SCHOOL THE

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:19.678
MOUNTIE LAB IS LOCATED WITHIN

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.246

BOARD CERTIFIED PATHOLOGISTS

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.725
THAT SUPPORT THE KNEE CROPSEY

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:35.060
PROGRAM AND OTHER SERVICES SUCH

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:36.295
AS TOXICOLOGY.

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:38.464
THE TOXICOLOGY GROUP IS ALSO I

THANK YOU WILL TAKE SOME --

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:52.778
QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT IN TIME

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:53.078
[inaudible]

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:54.947
YES.

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:56.715
YES THANK YOU OF THIS YEAR.

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.050
THANK YOU FOR APPEARING TO THANK

00:16:58.117 --> 00:16:59.017
YOU ALL FOR COMING HERE AND IT

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:00.486
WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:02.121
US TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:04.223
TAKING PLACE -- IF YOU CAN JUST

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:05.624
KIND OF WALK US THROUGH --

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.926
DIRECTOR I UNDERSTAND WHO ARE

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:09.495
TWENTY THREE HORSES AT WHAT

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:10.829
POINT DID YOU GET.

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:12.398
VETERINARIANS AND EVERYONE

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:14.767
INVOLVED AT THE THE SIX PARTS

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:16.668
SEVEN HORSE AND OURS WHEN DID IT

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:19.138
IT BECOME AN URGENT URGENT

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.672
MATTER WHERE THE DISTRICT

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:23.776
ATTORNEY HAD TO BE A CALLED AND

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:25.911
WHICH ARE AN AUTOPSY DONE.

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:30.449
WALK US THROUGH THIS WHOLE --

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:31.116
TRAUMA THAT YOU ALL WENT THROUGH.

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:33.051
WE TRACK EVERY FATALITY AS IT

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:33.652
OCCURS AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.287
STUDY.

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:36.255
ANY KIND OF STATISTICAL OVER A

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:38.123
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.691
YOU ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.226
AN ANOMALY.

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:43.028
AND THE EARLY PART OF THE SENATE

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:44.696
NEED A MEETING.

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:47.566
WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RAIN.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:48.700
ACTUALLY THE NUMBERS FROM THE

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:50.903
VERY FIRST PART WERE NOT MUCH

00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:53.305
DIFFERENT THAN PREVIOUS YEARS.

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:54.540
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THOSE

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:57.743
NUMBERS BECAME MORE NUMEROUS --

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.479
WE IMMEDIATELY GOT DR ARTHUR

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:02.748
INVOLVED -- SPOKE NOT ONLY WITH

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:04.216
OUR OFFICIAL VETERINARIAN BUT

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:06.251
THE TRACK VETERINARIAN ALSO THE

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:08.287
RACING OFFICE AT SANTA ANITA.

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:09.555
MANAGEMENT IS SANTA.

00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:11.390
AND THESE NUMBERS BEGAN TO

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:13.525
ESCALATE RATHER RAPIDLY.

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.527
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FRUSTRATION.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.262
ON THE PART OF THE BOARD.

00:18:17.329 --> 00:18:19.398
OF NOT BEING ABLE TO STEP IN AND

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:20.632
STOP THINGS.

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:23.368
AS A RESULT SENATOR DODD OF

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:25.204
SOMEBODY GERMAN GRAY.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:29.208
HAVE MOVED THIS BILL AS BEFORE

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:29.808
SIXTY NINE WHICH WILL GIVE THE

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.009
BOARD THE AUTHORITY.

00:18:31.076 --> 00:18:33.512
IN FUTURE TO STEP IN AND ACT

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:34.480
IMMEDIATELY.

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:35.914
THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT SO

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:37.349
I THINK THE ANSWER TO YOUR

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:39.151
QUESTION SIR IS THAT -- WE WERE

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:41.720
AWARE OF THE PROBLEM FROM THE

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:41.920
START.

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:43.989
YET.

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.425
I THINK THOSE PROBABLY IS FAIR

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:49.528
TO SAY THAT WE EXPECTED THAT IT

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:51.663
WAS AN ANOMALY AND THAT IS

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.898
ENOUGH AS A MATTER OF FACT

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.800
THINGS WOULD CALM DOWN.

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:55.968
IN RETURN TO NORMAL.

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.269
INSTEAD THEY RAMPED UP

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:58.937
DRAMATICALLY IN A SHORT PERIOD

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:02.674
OF TIME -- SO WE DID ACT WE

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:03.942
TALKED MANAGEMENT AT SANTA ANITA.

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:05.944
THEY DECIDED TO CLOSE TRAINING

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:09.081
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS -- RE OPEN.

00:19:09.147 --> 00:19:11.750
AT ANOTHER FATALITY AND THEN

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:12.284
THEY DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:13.051
ALTOGETHER.

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.019
I THINK YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:15.787
REST OF THE TIME LINE.

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:16.421
SO WE WERE INVOLVED EVERY STEP

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:17.289
OF THE WAY.

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:19.291
AND DID YOU FIND THAT THOSE LAST

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:22.227
TWO HORSES DIED I THINK THIS

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:23.562
LAST WEEKEND.

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.464
PERHAPS THIS SAME TYPE OF EITHER

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:29.201
MEDICATION OR OR SOIL OR I MEAN

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:30.769
HAVE YOU GOTTEN A CLUE WHAT THIS

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:32.638
MIGHT BE SO WHAT I'LL GIVE THIS

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:33.772
TO DOCTOR ARE THERE IN A MINUTE

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:34.339
BUT THE ONE THING THAT STE

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:36.174
MEDICALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THE

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:37.609
PREVIOUS ONES AND THESE.

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:38.977
IS.

00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:40.112
MAYBE NOT AND MAYBE IT'S NOT

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:41.113
ENTIRELY THERE BECAUSE WE DID

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.814
OUR BRAIN RECENTLY BUT I THINK

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:44.316
DOCTOR ARE THERE CAN COMMENT ON

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:45.551
THIS BETTER THAN I CAN BUT THE

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:46.618
EARLY ONES.

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:49.221
CERTAINLY WERE AFFECTED BY THE

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:50.889
FOURTEEN INCHES OF RAIN DURING

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:51.890
THE SAME.

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.225
PERIOD THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:54.493
GOT.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.596
TO SELL WAS CREATED A RATHER

00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:59.464
UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:00.132
TERMS OF MAINTAINING THE

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:02.167
RACETRACK SEALING IT OPENING IT

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.769
BACK UP SEALING THE CEILING

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:06.772
AGAIN -- AND I THINK THERE'S NO

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:08.640
QUESTION IT PUT VULNERABLE

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.409
HORSES MORE AT RISK.

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.144
THE FOCUS OF MANY OF THE THINGS

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.378
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR TODAY IS

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:16.148
ABOUT BETTER IDENTIFYING THOSE

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.015
VULNERABLE HORSES.

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:18.717
AT THE BOARD ALSO WILL BE

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:20.886
CONSIDERING SOME RESTRICTIONS ON

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:22.254
TRACK MAINTENANCE GOING FORWARD

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.488
DOCTOR ARE THROUGH YOU CAN TALK

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:24.790
ABOUT THE MEDICAL PART OF AND

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:27.326
BEFORE YOU GO ON DR I I I ASK.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:29.027
FOR IN A RESULT OF AN AUTOPSY

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:31.296
DID YOU CONDUCT ANY IS ALONG THE

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:33.065
WAY.

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:36.435
EVERY WORDS DIES WITHIN THE

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:42.474
ENCLOSURE OF A BE RAISING YOUR

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.309
CALIFORNIA.

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:45.677
THE LABORATORY SITE SO THE

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.312
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER IN THE YOU

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.547
KNOW WE DO THAT WITH YOU.

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:51.016
EXACTLY SURE WE EVEN HAVE A A

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:58.223
VERY ONLY IF THAT WAS ENFORCED --

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.492
THE PROPERTY SO WE ARE FAMILIAR

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:01.660
WITH THESE WE MONITOR I'M I WANT.

00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:03.362
EVERYONE. TO COME THROUGH SO

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.163
THAT THAT IS STANDARD OPERATING

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.764
PROCEDURE FOR US.

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:08.333
BUT GET YOUR SECOND QUESTION THE

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.301
THE LATEST TO THE TALON THESE

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:12.571
ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST --

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:13.538
TWENTY THREE ONE OF THOSE WAS

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:16.241
SENT DOWN WHICH IS ABOUT 5% OF

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:18.944
THE TRAINING AND RACING BUT ALEX

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.545
OVER ALL.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.247
THE TWENTY TWO MUSCLES SO ALLEN

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:24.983
THESE NINETEEN OF THOSE TWENTY

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.284
TWO MORE OF THE FACT LOCKED.

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.853
WOULD BE INCLUDING THE PROXIMAL

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:30.088
SESAMOID BONE WHICH IS A BONUS

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:33.058
VERY PRONE. TO EIGHT HIGH

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.428
INTENSITY EXERCISE -- A

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:38.764
COMBINATION OF EIGHT EIGHT

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.499
FRANKLY HARD TRACKS IN

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:41.767
OVERTRAINING.

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:44.002
AND WE'RE STILL IN A

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:46.004
INVESTIGATION PART OF THAT AND I

00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:47.072
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.507
FIND BUT EIGHT THAT'S A

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:51.510
PULMONARY STATEMENT -- SO I TAKE

00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:52.711
THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BUT

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:54.312
YEAH YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:56.715
IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAST TWO ARE

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:58.316
DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST.

00:21:58.383 --> 00:21:59.217
TWENTY TWO MY FELLOW THE LAST

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:00.118
COUPLE QUESTIONS WE SHARE THE

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:02.688
COMMON DENOMINATOR BETWEEN THOSE

00:22:02.754 --> 00:22:03.221
TWENTY THREE WERE ABLE TO

00:22:03.288 --> 00:22:04.523
DISCOVER THAT.

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:06.925
IN THAT WHAT LED YOU TO TO GET

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.527
THE THE TO THE DA'S OFFICE

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:20.105
INVOLVED DID YOU SUSPECT

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.940
SOMETHING.

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:22.607
I WASN'T INVOLVED IN GETTING IT

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.443
DA'S OFFICE INVOLVED I LOOK AT

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:25.711
THIS MORE AS AN ACADEMIC -- IT --

00:22:25.777 --> 00:22:26.611
EFFORT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:27.245
THESE SOURCES FRACTURED AND HOW

00:22:27.312 --> 00:22:28.080
WE CAN AVOID IT I MEAN THEY THEY

00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:28.647
INVESTIGATIONS A LITTLE BIT

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:29.281
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE USUALLY

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:30.882
DO -- BUT YEAH THEY THE

00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:31.750
COMMONALITY IS AT THE HORSES

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:33.385
HAVE ACCUMULATED MORE HIGH SPEED

00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:36.788
EXERCISE IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:36.988
TIME.

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.223
THE NICKEL HEARTS.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.558
THEN I CAN ADDRESS THAT INVEST

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:41.359
THE DA'S PART OF THIS THING.

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:43.395
WE DID NOT APPROACH THE DA --

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:45.163
OTHERS DID ASK THE DA TO GET

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.465
INVOLVED.

00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:49.701
AND SO THE THE DAY DECIDED -- TO

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:51.570
APPROACH US IN TO CONDUCT A

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:54.673
JOINT -- CAN INVESTIGATION ON ON

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.341
EACH OF THESE BAY TELL THESE THE

00:22:56.408 --> 00:22:58.043
SANITY TO RETRACT HAS SUCH A

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.545
GREAT REPUTATION -- GOOD NUMBER

00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:02.180
OF YEARS JUST A JUST A BEAUTIFUL

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:04.750
PLACE -- AND I'M SURE EVERYONE

00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:06.318
THERE IS IS COOPERATING AND TRY

00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:07.686
AND DO WHAT THEY CAN.

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:09.588
OF WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR NEXT

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.690
STEP IS GOING TO BE HERE THE

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:14.326
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:16.027
WELL WE'VE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED A

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:18.463
NUMBER OF PROVISIONS WE HAVE AND

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.065
MANAGEMENT AT SANTA ANITA HAS

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:20.732
YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM A LITTLE

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:24.002
LATER -- IN THIS HEARING -- SO

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.537
WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO

00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:27.205
EVERYTHING THAT -- WE CAN

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:30.375
POSSIBLY DO -- WE WE'VE

00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:31.943
IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM AT SANTA

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.880
AT DEL MAR THREE SUMMERS AGO.

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:36.414
AFTER THERE WAS A SPATTER OF

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.850
FATALITIES NOT NEARLY AS BAD AS

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:41.353
THIS BUT VERY ALARMING.

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:43.455
AND WORKING WITH DOCTOR ARTHUR

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:45.056
DOCTOR ARE THERE WITH THE OTHER

00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:46.658
OFFICIAL THAT'S PUT TOGETHER A

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:48.193
PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED US TO

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.462
IDENTIFY HORSES THAT WORK RISK.

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.564
IT IS DOCTOR ARTHUR REFLECTED IN

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:54.566
HIS COMMENTS WE'RE VERY

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:56.902
ENCOURAGED WITH SEEN JUST SINCE

00:23:56.968 --> 00:23:58.470
TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WE HAD

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:00.438
SEEN A 60% REDUCTION IN

00:24:00.505 --> 00:24:01.840
FATALITIES.

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.809
SO THIS.

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:05.177
EXPERIENCE AT SANTA ANITA.

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:10.081
THIS YEAR -- STOPPED ALL OF THAT

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:11.983
PROGRESS IN ITS TRACKS.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.451
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK

00:24:13.518 --> 00:24:14.419
ABOUT THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS IN

00:24:14.486 --> 00:24:16.555
LIGHT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED -- BUT

00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:18.590
I'M CONFIDENT THAT NOT ONLY ALL

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:21.193
OF THOSE CHANGES AND PROGRAMS

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:23.028
THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE AS A

00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:23.795
RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED A DOWN

00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:24.563
MARKET.

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.331
BUT MANY MORE JUST LIKE IT NOW

00:24:26.398 --> 00:24:28.867
WHETHER ON THE PART OF THE BOARD

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:29.467
FOR THE PART OF MANAGEMENT AT

00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:30.602
SANTA ANITA.

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:31.937
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:33.672
HAVE THEIR AFFECT ON RACING

00:24:33.738 --> 00:24:34.673
GOING FORWARD.

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:36.474
IT IT SOUNDS WEIRD TO SAY BUT I

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:37.742
THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:40.478
WITH ALL OF THE SAFETY MEASURES

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:41.613
NOW IN PLACE.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.782
RACING IS NEVER BEEN SAFER IN

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:45.150
CALIFORNIA THAT IT IS.

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:47.319
ODDLY PROBABLY PARTLY BECAUSE OF

00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:48.353
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:09.941
ESPECIALLY FOR ALL OF US TOUGH

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.676
FOR ME PERSONALLY THE SAFETY OF

00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:14.045
THE HORSES AND THE JOCKEY IS OF

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:15.547

MORE SUSTAIN.

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:36.067
BUT I THINK THAT WORK ON THE

00:25:36.134 --> 00:25:37.302
RIGHT TRACK IN TERMS OF NOT

DEVELOPING A SCANNED A PET SCANS

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:50.782
SO WE DON'T HAVE. ONE CURRENTLY

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:52.617
THAT WORKS OUT RIGHT AT THAT HAS

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:53.418
BEEN USED.

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:55.153
I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF THIS IS

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.555
THE FIRST ONE THAT'S BEING --

SCHOOL HERE IN DAVIS DEVELOPED

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.363
THE TECHNOLOGY -- FOR POSSIBLY

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.132
EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY IT'S THE

A HORSE.

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:10.568
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:12.537
DEVELOPING IS STANDING THEY THEY

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:13.872
HAVE TO BE ANESTHETIZED FOR THE

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:15.473

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:24.182
COMPANY IS DEVELOPING A STANDING --

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:26.451
P. ET SCAN WHICH ALLOWS THE

00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:29.054
HORSES NOT TO BE ANESTHETIZED

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.422
AND BE EXAMINED AT SANTA ANITA

00:26:30.488 --> 00:26:31.790
OR FORTUNATE SANITY DO WE

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:33.191
ALREADY HAVE A NUCLEAR IMAGING

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:34.859
FACILITIES SO WE HAVE ALL THE

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:36.528
NUCLEAR MEDICINE LICENSES.

00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:37.829
AND WE JUST MET EARLIER THIS

00:26:37.896 --> 00:26:40.198
WEEK WITH THE MANUFACTURE AND

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:42.233
DOCTOR SPRY AT AND AND HOPEFULLY

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:51.376
WE'LL HAVE IT THERE BEFORE --

00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:52.243
BREEDERS CUP.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.144
THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M IN THIS

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:53.912
QUESTION IS.

FOR I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GET YOUR

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:55.947
NAME EARLIER TODAY FOR GETTING

00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:57.849
ME ONE SECOND HERE I THINK IT'S

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:59.985
TIME DR HEATHER.

00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:00.819
WHAT I THINK IT WAS YOU I'M

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:02.153
SORRY FIGHT I WANT TO AYE SOME

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:02.821
TOO MANY WERE TALKING ONE OF YOU

00:27:02.887 --> 00:27:03.755
WERE YOU WERE EXPRESSING OF

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:05.323
FINING YOU MET THE METHODOLOGIES

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.957
TO DETECT DRUG ADMINISTRATION?

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:07.959
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW LONG THAT'S

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:09.794
GOING TO TAKE AND WHEN YOU SEE

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:11.296
THIS BEING USED.

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:13.498
THE ONE AT THE EXAMPLE I GAVE

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:14.432
WAS THAT OF THE BLOOD THAT WE

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:14.632
NEED.

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:15.934
TO WAIT WHICH WE CURRENTLY DO

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:18.303
HAVE METHODOLOGY PLACE TO DETECT --

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.140
USING OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY BUT

00:27:22.207 --> 00:27:24.409
WE'VE HEARD RUMORS OF MICRO.

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:25.944
WE'VE HEARD RUMORS OF MICRO

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.445
DISTINGUISHES ADMINISTRATION OF

00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:29.481
LOW DOSES WITH -- HOPING TO GET

00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:30.548
THE SAME EFFECT BUT YET

00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:31.950
CIRCUMVENTING DETECTION

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.451
PROCEDURES SO WHAT WE ARE DOING

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:35.120
THERE IS TRYING TO DEVELOP

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:36.521
ESSENTIALLY BIOMARKERS.

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:37.889
SO THINGS THAT CHANGE IN

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:39.557
RESPONSE TO DRUG ADMINISTRATION

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:41.026
SO THAT WOULD HELP COMPLEMENT

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:42.894
OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY SO WE

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:44.596
COULD POTENTIALLY DEVELOP THIS

00:27:44.662 --> 00:27:46.231
FOR OTHER DRUGS AS WELL.

00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:47.899
THANK YOU WELL ONE OF THE

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:48.833
COMMENTS THAT I THAT I WANT

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.802
EXPRESSED OUT NOT ONLY BECAUSE

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:52.904
YOU KNOW AS I STATED BEFORE IT

00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:55.240
IS IN MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:56.741
THAT SENATE EMPLOYS SO MANY

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:58.109
PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND

00:27:58.176 --> 00:27:59.144
THEY'RE CONCERNED THEY'RE

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.646
WORRIED AND BEFORE. FOR ME

00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:03.348
PERSONALLY I WANT TO MOVE VERY

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:04.883
CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT WE FIND

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:06.551
OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:08.319
THIS BETTER SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

00:28:08.386 --> 00:28:09.921
AGAIN AND THEN WE HAVE A

00:28:09.988 --> 00:28:11.890
SUSTAINABLE HORSE.

00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:15.627
RACING -- INDUSTRY THAT IS ALSO

00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:17.796
THAT THE INTEGRITY IS STILL

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:19.431
INTACT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW KERRY

00:28:19.497 --> 00:28:21.232
THERE'S A LOT OF THIS --

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.467
CONCERNED ABOUT THE DOG BEING

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.436
AND AND AND USING DRUGS ON

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:25.603
HORSES SO.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.971
FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.640
FOR TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:29.908
BUT I ALSO WANT TO CAUTION LIKE

00:28:29.974 --> 00:28:31.443
I SAID ON MY COLLEAGUES TO MOVE

00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:33.311
VERY CAUTIOUSLY BECAUSE RIGHT

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:35.180
NOW AS WE SPEAK WE HAVE PEOPLE

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:36.181
THAT ARE LISTENING.

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:37.816
THAT WORKS THERE AND AGAIN I

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:39.584
WANT TO BE VERY MINDFUL THAT

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:40.952
THIS IS THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND SO

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.520
I WANT TO MOVE WITH WITH DATA

00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:43.888
WITH EVIDENCE AND WITH

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:45.223
INFORMATION ON OUR HANDS BUT

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:50.261
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TRYING TO

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:50.662

REALLY APPRECIATE IT

00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:52.497
[inaudible]

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.766
BILLS.

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.301
OKAY -- I'VE I'VE I I'VE GOT A

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:57.368
QUESTION AB ANYBODY CAN TAKE

00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:57.569
THIS.

00:28:57.635 --> 00:28:59.471
CAN YOU EXPLAIN -- AT WHAT A

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:02.540
CATASTROPHIC INJURY IS AND WHY

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:05.543
DOES IT ALMOST ALWAYS LEAD TO

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.979
EUTHANASIA -- THE HORSE AND THEN

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:10.348
MAYBE THE LAST THING IS.

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.417
DO WE ALWAYS HAVE -- TO UTILIZE

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:15.653
THEM IS THERE SOME OTHER.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.057
USE -- FOR THEM AB ONE THIS

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:19.858
WORLD.

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:22.927
YEAH I'LL TAKE THAT -- I'VE BEEN

00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:24.996
I STARTED PRACTICING A PRACTICE

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:25.930
FOR THIRTY YEARS AND SANTA NEED

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.632
IN PRACTICE OF MY FORTY SECOND

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:30.135
OPENING -- DAY IT SANTA NEEDED

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:31.202
THIS YEAR.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.805
AND THEIR HORSES STACKED -- WE

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:36.007
WOULD USE A NICE BACK FORTY TWO

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:37.742
YEARS AGO THAT ARE REPAIRED IN

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:40.245
RACING TODAY -- MOST INJURIES

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:43.648
ARE -- REPAIRED YOU KNOW FORCES

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:45.416
GO TO OTHER CAREERS TO GO TO THE

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:48.786
BREEDING CHAD -- SO THE THE

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:50.822
CATASTROPHIC INJURIES OR IN

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.323
ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING A FATAL

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.926
INJURIES SO -- THEY'RE STILL AT

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.862
RELATIVELY A SMALL PORTION OF

00:29:57.929 --> 00:29:59.397
THE INJURIES THE ATHLETIC

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:02.167
INJURIES THAT OCCUR -- BUT THE

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:03.935
PROBLEM WITH FORCES IS THAT THEY

00:30:04.002 --> 00:30:06.271
HAVE TO BE STANDING ON ALL ALL

00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:08.106
FOUR LEGS -- IT ALMOST

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:10.808
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SURGERY SO IT

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:18.683
LIMITS YOUR ABILITY REPAIR SOME

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.987
FRACTURES -- AND IT ALSO WAS.

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:23.621
MY FINAL QUESTION APPEARS IT.

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:25.423
IT IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.491
CONDUCT HORSE RACING RATES OF

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:27.992
COURSE TO TELL THESE ARE LOWER.

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:29.093
IT IN SOME INSTANCES MUCH LOWER.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.061
THAN THE RATES EXPERIENCE IN THE

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:32.330
UNITED STATES DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:33.932
THOUGHTS ON WHY THAT IS -- I I

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:34.933
WILL TELL YOU MY INTERNATIONAL

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:37.335
COLLEAGUES -- BELIEVE IT IS

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:38.670
BECAUSE OF ARE RELATIVELY

00:30:38.736 --> 00:30:41.339
LIBERAL -- MEDICATION POLICIES

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:43.541
IN THE U. S. -- I'M NOT

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:45.610
CONVEYANCE IS SET SIMPLE WE HAVE

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:49.113
A CLAIMING OF GAME AYE AYE.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.415
YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE INSIDE

00:30:50.481 --> 00:30:51.950
BASEBALL BUT THERE ARE SOME

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.985
BUSINESS ASPECTS OF COURSE

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:56.054
RACING THAT PUT MORE STRESS ON

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.989
HORSES TO TREAT HIM A LITTLE BIT

00:30:58.056 --> 00:30:59.924
MORE LIKE A COMMODITY.

00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:01.593
THAN THEY DO INTERNATIONALLY --

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:03.494
WE'VE TRIED TO ELIMINATE SOME OF

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:05.530
THE NEGATIVE IN ST TEAMS FOR NOT

00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:07.065
DOING RIGHT BY THE HORSE AND I

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:08.399
THINK WE'VE BEEN FAIRLY

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.268
SUCCESSFUL AT THAT -- THE ALSO

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:12.904
RECENT TURF -- IN MANY OF THE

00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:15.306
EUROPEAN YOU -- OR INTERNATIONAL

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:18.810
JURISDICTIONS AS COMPARED DIRT

00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:22.113
IN CALIFORNIA -- IN DIRT IS A

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:27.885
LESS FORGIVING SURFACED IN TURF.

00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:30.521
OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:32.523
I GUESS OF THE I HAVE.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.826
YOUR YOUR ANSWER -- MAYBE THING

00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:38.363
ANOTHER QUESTION -- DO WE RACE

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:40.064
ALL YEAR ROUND HERE AND DO THEY

00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:41.733
RACE ALL YEAR ROUND EVERYWHERE

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:44.936
ELSE -- THEY RACE YEAR ROUND IN

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:46.804
AUSTRALIA AND THAT'S ABOUT THE

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.673
ONLY MAJOR JURISDICTION THAT I'M

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.642
AWARE OF THE DOES -- TO EUROPE

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:53.845
IS -- SEASONAL -- HONG KONG HAS

00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:56.848
ABOUT -- QUé -- SIX WEEKS BREAK.

00:31:56.914 --> 00:31:58.683
IN FACT THIS BREAK FROM SANTA

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.585
NEED -- TO WHEN THEY WERE RE

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:02.287
WORKING THE RACETRACK IS THE

00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:03.588
LARGEST BREAK THAT I CAN

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.256
REMEMBER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:06.491
RACING.

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:10.962
IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR MORE.

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:12.664
MISTER BECKER I GOT.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.898
SAY IT'S MY FINAL ONE BUT I YOU

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:14.899
KNOW YOU BEEN CONNECTED RACING

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:18.970
YOU ALMOST YOUR ENTIRE LIFE --

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:21.606
IF YOU SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:23.341
BEFORE THIS THIS.

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:26.711
SPIKE THAT -- THAT WE HAVE

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.479
WITNESSED ITS INUNDATED -- NO

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:30.214
NOT ANYTHING CLOSE THE THE ONLY

00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:33.418
OTHER EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD WAS --

00:32:33.484 --> 00:32:35.353
THE ONE I REFERENCED AT DEL MAR --

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.721
WERE NUMBER FORCES DURING THE

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.891
FIRST WEEK DOWN THERE -- WERE

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:43.161
LOST AND AS AS I SAID THAT LED

00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:44.295
TO A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:45.897
CHANGED THINGS AND YOU KNOW WE

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:47.865
WERE GOING REALLY MAKING GREAT

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:48.433
PROGRESS GOING IN THE RIGHT

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:49.167
DIRECTION.

00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:50.935
I IT WASN'T THIS WAY A LONG TIME

00:32:51.002 --> 00:32:52.437
AGO -- BACK WHEN I WAS GROWING

00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:54.772
UP IN THE SPORT -- AND I THINK

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:57.075
VERY SIMPLY THERE WERE MANY MORE.

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.844
FORCES INVOLVED IN RACING --

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:01.713
CALIFORNIA WAS A PRIME

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.514
OPPORTUNITY FOR A WORST RACE --

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:06.951
IF -- HORSE BECAME INJURED HERE --

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:07.418
YEAH.

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:08.953
PROBABLY YOU KNOW WENT ON THE

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.388
DISABLED LIST AND ANOTHER FRESH

00:33:10.455 --> 00:33:12.924
HORSE WAS BROUGHT IN -- THERE

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.626
WERE ALMOST TWICE AS MANY FULLS

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:17.628
OF BACK THEN AS THERE ARE NOW --

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:19.130
SO THAT HAS STRESSED TO THE

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:21.466
RACING POPULATION WE WE DO REYES

00:33:21.532 --> 00:33:22.767
DAY AND NIGHT NORTH AND SOUTH IN

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:26.437
CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE ALMOST

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:27.238
FIVE THOUSAND HORSES.

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:29.006
IN NOT IN OUR CLOSURES IN

00:33:29.073 --> 00:33:30.875
CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDES CORE

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:33.511
WORSEN HARNESS RACING -- SO

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:38.449
THERE'S NO PRESSURE THAT THAT --

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:39.083
YOU KNOW FORCES ARE UNDER MORE

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.785
PRESSURE.

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:42.553
I WAS SO RELIEVED.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.522
THE RUBIO YES THANK YOU -- I

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:46.624
JUST I I DID READ THE REPORT --

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:47.692
SOMEONE HANDED ME THEIR CAR FROM

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:48.326
THE JOCKEY CLUB IN A TALKS AT A

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:49.794
LOT ABOUT CHEATING IN THE

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:50.395
INDUSTRY SOME I CAN ASK THIS

00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:52.096
QUESTION JUST BECAUSE I DON'T

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:53.564
KNOW MAYBE YOU CAN HELP CLARIFY --

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:55.633
YOU FOR YOUR YOU STATED THAT

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.201
WHEN THE HEART GETS INJURED THE

00:33:57.268 --> 00:33:58.636
MEDICAL RECORDS ARE GOING TO

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:00.371
FOLLOW NOW THAT THE HORSE.

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.573
AND I KNOW FOR US THERE'S STUFF

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.975
SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE AS IT

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:05.576
PERTAINS TO KEEPING YOUR MEDICAL

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:07.011
RECORDS PRIVATE SO NO ONE CAN

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:08.846
ALTER THEM SO IS THERE ANYTHING

00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:10.081
IN THE INDUSTRY THAT WOULD

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:11.516
PREVENT SOMEONE FROM CHANGING

00:34:11.582 --> 00:34:13.284
THE RECORDS AND ALL TRAIN ANY.

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:18.589
THAT INFORMATION TO TRY AND

00:34:18.656 --> 00:34:19.624
CHEAT THE SYSTEM.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:20.858
NO I DON'T THINK SO AS A MATTER

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:21.526
OF FACT COURSE ANY OF THAT WOULD

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:22.326
ONCE DISCOVERED WOULD AMOUNT TO

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.628
A VIOLATION AND A COMPLAINT

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:25.329
FILED AND IN THE IF IT WAS A

00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:26.898
VETERINARIAN. TO LOSE THE

00:34:26.964 --> 00:34:28.433
ABILITY TO PRACTICE IN RACING IN

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:30.201
CALIFORNIA -- THERE IS A

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:31.602
PROVISION IN THE VETERINARY

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:32.804
MEDICAL LAW.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.539
THAT SAYS THAT ANY OTHER STATE

00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:37.575
JURISDICTION -- CAN REQUIRE AN

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:39.277
EXCEPTION TO THE PRIVACY.

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:40.044
LAW.

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:42.713
AND SO AS A RESULT WE ARE ABLE

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.015
TO REQUIRE THAT THE MEDICAL

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:47.652
RECORDS ARE TRANSFERRED WITH THE

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:47.852
HORSE.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:50.154
THAT [inaudible]

00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:53.090
THAT'S THANK YOU.

00:34:53.157 --> 00:34:55.026
I WAS FOR YOU.

00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.060
OTHER THAN THOSE FOR YOU THAT'S

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:58.096
A RELATIVELY NEW -- PROVISIONS

00:34:58.162 --> 00:34:59.897
IN IN OUR RULES AND REX BUT

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:01.532
WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING MORE THAT --

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.967
AS WE GO FORWARD TO THE POINT

00:35:03.034 --> 00:35:04.335
WHERE I THINK THAT WILL BE

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:05.870
COMMONPLACE THAT THE RECORDS

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.238
MOVE ALONG WITH THE HORSE FROM

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:08.706
START. TO THE END OF HIS CAREER

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:10.475
IS THERE ANY SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN

00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:11.909
DEVELOPER IN PLACE THAT.

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:14.145
YOU CAN SHARE VIA THE INTERNET

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:16.247
OR THROUGH TECHNOLOGY VERSUS

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:18.616
PHYSICAL RECORDS AGAIN I DON'T

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:19.917
UNDERSTAND THAT SOME CHINA CD

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:20.985
CAN HELP EDUCATE ME ON THAT

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:22.086
DOCTOR ARE THERE'S BEEN WORKING

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:24.188
ON A PROGRAM WITH THE JOCKEY

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:25.823
CLUB THAT'S COINCIDENTAL TO THAT.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.125
YEAH WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:29.327
A PROGRAM -- FOR SEVERAL YEARS

00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:30.962
THAT WOULD ALLOW TREATMENT

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:33.064
RECORDS TO BE -- RECORDED

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.333
ELECTRONICALLY WE MAINTAIN NOW

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:38.603
NORMAIS BOXES OF HAND WRITTEN

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:42.039
HARD TO READ -- PAPER RECORDS

00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:43.174
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:44.909
ELECTRONICALLY RECORDED THAT

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.677
WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE TO EASY

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:48.279
TRANSFER MOST VETERINARY

00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:51.282
PRACTICES ARE COMPUTERIZED TODAY.

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:53.351
SO THAT WERE TRYING TO FIGURE

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:55.453
OUT A WAY WHERE THEY CAN TIE IN

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.688
THIS THE TWO SYSTEMS TOGETHER SO

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.423
THAT WOULD BE MORE.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.527
USER FRIENDLY BUT I I WILL TELL

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:04.228
YOU THESE THINGS OR OR YOU SOUND

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:05.563
EASY BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS MORE

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.331
DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET

00:36:07.398 --> 00:36:09.333
INTO TRYING. TO TO MASH UP

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.769
MULTIPLE -- COMPUTER PROGRAMS

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:14.238
TOGETHER BUT ONCE WE GET THERE

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:15.673
THEN THAT DATABASE WILL BE

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.974
SEARCHABLE.

00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:18.376
AND RELATABLE.

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:20.745
SO WEEKEND THE EXPERTS THE

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:22.680
DOCTORS CAN'T DISCERN ANY KIND

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:24.916
OF PATTERNS ANY PARTICULAR

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:26.484
INCREASING USE OF A PARTICULAR

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.686
STE -- MEDICATION -- THAT MAY BE

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:30.454
APPROPRIATE MAYBE NOT.

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:32.857
AND SO WE OUR EXPERTS CAN BECOME

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:34.425
MORE EDUCATED AS TO WHAT IS

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:35.526
BEING USED.

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:37.028
BY THE VETERINARY COMMUNITY ON

00:36:37.094 --> 00:36:39.063
THE BACKSIDE -- IT IS DOCTOR

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:40.164
ARTHUR SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:42.533
TO DO NOW WITH THE OLD SCHOOL

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.868
METHOD OF REPORTING.

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:49.473
SO I HOPE TO SEE HAS GET THERE

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.909
THANK YOU.

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:54.478
IT'S A JOB FIRST AND THEN

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.647
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS.

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:57.348
I THINK YOU'RE MY CHEN IS GERMAN --

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:58.149
I WALKED IN A LITTLE BIT LATE SO

00:36:58.215 --> 00:36:58.783
I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR INCOME IS

00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:59.283
BUT I HAVE.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:00.451
TWO BASIC CATEGORIES OF IT OF A

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:01.452
QUESTION IS.

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:02.920
THE FIRST A CATEGORY OF THINGS

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.956
TO THE BECAUSE FOR THE DEBTS THE

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:05.890
MOTHER PUT THAT.

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:07.525
ON I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:09.160
SOME CONSULTANTS WHO WERE ON

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:11.762
SITE EXAMINING TO SURFACE -- AND

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:13.731
BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY RAIN THAT

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:16.634
OCCUR PRIOR TO SO OFFICE SO SO

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:18.302
QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WERE YOU

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:20.671
ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OR

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.440
CAUSES OF OF FOR THESE MULTIPLE

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:22.873
DEBTS.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.443
AND OF THE SECOND CATEGORY OF OF

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:27.578
THE QUESTION IS -- I UNDERSTAND

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:29.480
THAT THE RACE TRACK LONG WAY TO

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:31.649
THE AIRPORT ALL ADOPTED A NUMBER

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:33.884
OF REFORMS INCLUDING THINGS LIKE --

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:35.386
THE PHASING OUT OF THE LEAST

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:37.755
SICK AND THE LIMITED USE OF THE

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:40.057
CROP ALSO THE SCANNING OF THE

00:37:40.124 --> 00:37:42.460
HORSES A PRIOR TO US IN THE

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:43.027
LIGHT.

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.729
OF SO I WAS WONDERING IF OF DUES

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:46.998
MEASURES THOSE REFORM MEASURES

00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:48.499
ALL WOULD DO IT THE TEAM

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:50.868
ADEQUATE FOR EXAMPLE TO AT LEAST

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:53.237
CARP THE THE SITUATION OR YOU

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:55.206
KNOW TO BASICALLY.

00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:56.707
TO ADDRESS IT TO ME.

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:57.742
THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE COULD WE

00:37:57.808 --> 00:37:58.709
ADDRESS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.911
WE HAVE AN EXPERT ON THE TRACKS

00:38:00.978 --> 00:38:02.413
HERE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE RIGHT

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.481
FOR TODD SAID.

00:38:03.547 --> 00:38:04.115
DRESSES SECOND WHEN YOU CAN ASK

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:15.026
THE FIRST QUESTION TO ANOTHER

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:15.226
PANEL.

00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:16.293
THANK YOU.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:16.961
YEAH SO IN TERMS OF WHAT WE USED

00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:18.596
FROM THE INVESTIGATIONS -- I

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:19.764
EXPLAINED IN MY REMARKS THAT

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.598
THEIR ON GOING THERE WITH THESE

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.166
ARE ENHANCED INVESTIGATIONS THEY

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:22.967
INVOLVE A CH ARE BE SWORN

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:23.434
INVESTIGATOR.

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:23.934
AS WELL AS AN OFFICIAL

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:25.636
VETERINARIAN AS WELL AS A

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:28.439
STEWARD -- WE HAVE ABOUT TWO

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:28.939
THIRDS OF THE INTERVIEWS

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:31.008
COMPLETED -- WE EXPECT TO HAVE

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:32.476
THEM ALL DONE IN THE NEXT FOUR

00:38:32.543 --> 00:38:34.512
WEEKS OR SO -- AT THAT POINT

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:36.514
WE'LL LEAVE IT -- TO THE DOCTORS

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.182
LIKE DOCTOR ARTHUR THE OFFICIAL

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:40.351
VETERINARIANS TO EXAMINE TE

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:42.119
RESULTS OF THE NEW CROP SEES TO

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:44.188
HELP US INTERPRET THE ANSWERS

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:44.689
THAT WERE GIVEN IN THE

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:47.491
INTERVIEWS -- AND IT'S POSSIBLE

00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:48.626
THEN THAT WE MIGHT DRAW SOME

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:51.429
CONCLUSIONS SOME COMMON THREAD.

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:53.731
IT'S NOT LIKELY FRANKLY BECAUSE

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:54.699
EACH HORSE IS DIFFERENT MAY HAVE

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:56.133
AT BREEZE KISSING CONDITIONS

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.169
SOME MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE

00:38:58.235 --> 00:38:59.503
FACT THAT THE THE EXTREME

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.205
WEATHER IN THE CONDITION OF THE

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:06.677
RACE TRACK WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:07.311
TO BEYOND A DOUBT RIGHT BUT WE

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:07.945
CAN DRAW CONCLUSIONS BUT IT'S

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:09.947
TOO SOON IF YOU KNOW ALL THESE

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.649
INVESTIGATIONS.

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:12.416
AS I STATED I THINK YOU WERE

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:13.784
HERE WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:15.052
BEING DONE IN COOPERATION WITH

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.587
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:18.889
SO THE VERY THOROUGH AND CAREFUL.

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:19.790
THE KIND OF TAKE AS LONG AS THEY

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:21.258
TAKE BUT ONCE THEY'RE DONE THEN

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.327
WE'LL BE ABLE TO EXAMINE THEM

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:24.729
MORE [inaudible]

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:26.030
THANK YOU.

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:28.299

THE SPECIFICS LIKE WITH

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:34.472
DIFFERENT BREEDS I'VE I'M A

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.307
HORSE OWNER AND WE'VE GOT TO SEE

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:38.275
WALKERS WE'VE GOT ARABIANS WE'VE

DIFFERENT STRUCTURE IN THE

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.251
BREEDS.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.223
AND EVEN THE TEMPERAMENTS IF YOU

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:53.591
ALL WANT.

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:54.892
TO TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:56.127
BECAUSE I THINK SOME MEMBERS

00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:57.561
THINK A HORSE IS A HORSE IS A

00:39:57.628 --> 00:39:58.596
HORSE.

00:39:58.662 --> 00:40:00.531
AND I I KNOW THERE'S A VERY VAST

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:03.868
DIFFERENCE -- BUT MAYBE TOUCHING

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:04.969
ON THAT BECAUSE I KNOW BONE

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:06.370
STRUCTURE IS A LOT DIFFERENT I

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:07.471
KNOW WHEN YOU DO INSURANCE

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:09.306
WRITING YOU DON'T START.

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:11.375
YOU DON'T GET HOME TILL THEIR

00:40:11.442 --> 00:40:13.144
FIVE WITH THIS REASON ON THAT

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.046
TOO MOST ON DO A LOT BETTER --

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:17.114
THREE YOU KNOW IN THE DIFFERENT

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:19.517
SPORTS HAVE DIFFERENT TIME LINES

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:19.984
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.419
IT SPECIFICALLY BASED ON THE

00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:23.921
HORSE'S BREEDING IN THE BOND

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:25.689
STRUCTURES IN THOSE THINGS FOR

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:26.757
WHAT IS BETTER SO CAN YOU GUYS

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.192
TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:31.295
JUST TO KIND OF INFORMED.

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:32.897
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:35.266
IT'S ACTUALLY -- GETS INTO SOME

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:36.967
PRETTY SERIOUS BONE PHYSIOLOGY

00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:38.169
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TRAINING

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:39.470
THROUGH A BROWSER LINK OUT

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:41.138
ANYWHERE BUT THEY THEIR THEIR

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:43.908
BONES ACTUALLY RESPOND -- TO

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:46.076
TRAINING -- IN THE HORSES OF

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:47.444
COURSE ARE BORN WITH RESOURCE

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:49.079
SKELTON'S THEY HAVE TO ADAPT AND

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:50.414
TRAINING DOES THAT AND IT JUST

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:53.117
SO HAPPENS THAT THE YOUNGER AGES --

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.919
THE BONE ADAPTS MORE CAREFULLY

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:56.921
GET STRONGER GET STRONG ENOUGH

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:59.089
TO BE AT A RATE SOURCING FACTORS

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:00.424
DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THE LATER

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:02.827
OR TO START -- THE MORE RISKS

00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:04.495
THEY ARE FOR INJURY.

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:07.064
SO COURSES WORDS LIKE A RACE CAR

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:09.466
THERE THEY HAVE IS LIGHT A BONUS

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:11.402
WE POSSIBLY CAN TO CARRY THAT.

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.803
HEAVY WEIGHT AROUND THE

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.738
RACETRACK -- STANDARDBRED

00:41:14.805 --> 00:41:16.407
SWITCHER TROTTERS OR A LITTLE

00:41:16.473 --> 00:41:18.142
BIT HAVE YOUR BILL THERE'S MORE

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:21.345
STYLE -- AND THEY'RE BIGGER GAIN

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:22.813
CLEAR HORSES FOR THE MOST PART

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.348
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN GET HIM ALL

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:25.549
OVER THE PLACE.

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:27.585
AND QUARTER HORSES ARE MOSTLY

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:29.153
THOROUGHBREDS TODAY BUT THERE'S

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.121
SORT OF THE SPRINTER TYPES OR

00:41:31.188 --> 00:41:35.492
THE THE THE FULL BACK TYPE OF OF

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:36.961
OF COURSES IN THEIR THEIR

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:38.162
STOUTER THEY'RE STRONGER AND

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:38.929
THEY GIVE.

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:41.599
A ENORMOUS BURST OF SPEED FOR A

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:43.167
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:44.268
SO IT IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:47.204

IN A SAFE MANNER.

00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:01.278
YOU CAN KEEP HIM FOCUSED AS YOU

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:02.746
SAW IN THE KENTUCKY DERBY HORSES

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:03.580
DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO RUN

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:06.149
STRAIGHT SO IT ALSO HELPS SHE

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:07.984
GUIDED TIMES BUT IT'S IT'S IS

00:53:08.051 --> 00:53:08.885
THE NECESSARY TOOL THAT WE

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:10.387
REALLY REALLY REALLY HAVE TO

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:11.688
HAVE.

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:12.289
AND AS FAR AS WHAT WE CAN DO

00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:18.094
BETTER OF THESE PRE RACE EXAMS --

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:19.963
WHATEVER WE COULD DO IS A WRITER --

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.864
IN ON POLICING OURSELVES IN AND

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:21.498
AND LET EACH OTHER KNOW THAT IF

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:22.065
SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL QUITE

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:22.799
RIGHT.

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:23.934
YOU KNOW JUST TO HEAD STRAIGHT

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.868
OVER TO THAT NEVER ENDS YOU KNOW

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:26.636
AND AND AND NOT TAKING ANY ANY

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:28.038
RISK AND IT'S RISKY ENOUGH AS IT

00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:29.739
IS BUT WE CAN ALL DO BETTER

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:31.041
WE'RE ALL GONNA WORK HARDER AT

00:53:31.107 --> 00:53:32.909
IT -- AND AND WE'VE BEEN DOING

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:34.811
SO I MEAN TRUST ME MY LIFE ON

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:36.046
THE LINE EVERY TIME I GO OUT

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:37.147

THE HORSE RACING IS REALLY THE

THAT REALLY NEEDS TO MODERNIZE.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.365
AND WHEN I FIRST FOLLOWED IN THE

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:19.802
FOOTSTEPS OF OUR FAMILY BUSINESS.

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.604
MY FOCUS WAS REALLY ABOUT.

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.573
HOW DO WE TURN AROUND THIS

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.041
INDUSTRY THAT IS DECLINING?

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:27.343

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:35.051
THE GUEST EXPERIENCE HOW WE CAN

ENHANCE THAT HOW WE CAN

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:39.188
MODERNIZE OUR FACILITIES HOW WE

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.756
CAN CURATE A COMPELLING.

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.992
ENTERTAINMENT OFFERING OF WHICH

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.393
HORSE RACING AND WAGERING IS AT

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.362
THE CORE.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.598
AND YOU KNOW APPLYING TECHNOLOGY

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.433
AS WELL AND NEW FORMS OF

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.634
WAGERING IN BETTER.

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:53.569
BUT AS I GOT MORE INTO IT AND

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:56.038
THEN TOGETHER WITH THE WITH THE

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:58.207
VERY UNFORTUNATE SERIES OF

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.408
EVENTS.

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:01.110
WAS RECENTLY AT SANTA ANITA.

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.778
MY FOCUS IN TOGETHER WITH OUR

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:04.280
MANAGEMENT TEAM TURN TO THE

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.582
INJURIES AND THE CATASTROPHIC

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:08.151
INJURIES AT SANTA ANITA.

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.886
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.721
THAT TO OF THOSE LESS FAMILIAR

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.856
WITH OUR WITH OUR INDUSTRY IN

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:15.825
OUR SPORT.

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:17.293
THE STRONG GROUP IN SANTA NEED

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.661
AND ALSO GOLDEN GATE FIELD HERE

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:19.729
IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:21.097
PLATFORM.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:24.333
AND WE ARE ALSO A STAKEHOLDER

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.936
INDUSTRY THAT MEANS WE NEED THE

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:28.638
JOCKEYS WE NEED THE TRAINERS WE

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:30.239
NEED THE HORSE OWNERS WE NEED

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.440
THE VETERINARIANS.

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:33.409
AND WE NEED EVERYBODY TO WORK

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:38.281
TOGETHER. TO TO TO MAKE SURE

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:39.515
THAT THIS STAKEHOLDERS QUIRK

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:39.815
[inaudible]

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.350
REALLY WORKS.

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:44.387
AND WITH THE WITH WHAT HAPPENED --

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:46.355
IN THE RECENT MONTHS WITH THE

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:48.257
INCREASING THE CATASTROPHIC

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:50.459
ENERGY ENTRIES WHAT WE DID IS WE

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:52.395
SAID WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:53.930
ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM.

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.831
THAT MAKES UP OUR SPORT AND

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:57.600
RACING AT SANTA ANITA.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.468
AS WE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.537
DOING THAT AND IT'S IMPORTANT

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.206
THAT I THINK BOB BAFFERT HAD TO

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:04.240
LEAVE.

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:06.008
BUT HE WAS IN A VERY DIFFICULT

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.877
POSITION WHERE HE WAS ONE

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:10.479
MORNING GIVING AN INTERVIEW --

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:12.148
WITH FOX TELEVISION LIVE.

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.716
AND WE SUDDENLY HAD ANOTHER

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:15.218
CATASTROPHIC INJURIES.

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:16.485
AND THAT WAS A VERY DEVASTATING

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:19.388
MOMENT FOR EVERYONE THAT WITNESS

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:20.957
TO THAT MOMENT.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:22.258
AS AN EXECUTIVE TEAM WITH AND

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.126
SAID LOOK WE REALLY HAVE TO DO

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:25.995
SOMETHING NOW.

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:27.630
THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT WE HAVE

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.699
REALLY TO HAVE COURSE WELFARE

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.100
AND WRITER WILL FOR AT THE

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.401
CENTER.

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:33.936
OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO.

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:35.705
IT WAS IN MID MARCH THAT WE

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:37.540
ISSUED THAT OPEN LETTER. TO THE

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:40.810
PUBLIC THAT STATED WHAT OUR

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:41.944
INTENTIONS WERE.

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:43.379
AND THAT WILL GO INTO THAT IN A

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:45.147
MINUTE.

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:48.184
I THINK WHAT MOST IMPORTANT WHAT.

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:50.720
BUT THAT THOSE REFORMS OF WHAT.

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:53.556
WHAT WHAT THAT LED TO IS?

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.191
I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA RACING IS

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:58.227
NOW THE SAFEST IN NORTH AMERICA.

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.329
WE HAVE MOVED TO INTERNATIONAL

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:03.065
STANDARDS ON ALL.

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.900
OTHER CONSISTENT WITH OR BETTER

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:07.470
THAN INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS.

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:09.171
EXCEPT FOR LASIX.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:11.374
AND WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR A

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.075
PHASE OUT OF LASIX.

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:14.910
AND WE'VE STATED THAT IN TWO

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.512
THOUSAND AND TWENTY ALL TWO YEAR

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.514
OLDS WILL BEGIN TO RUN WITHOUT

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.182
LASIX.

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:21.050
AND FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:23.119
CAREERS WILL NOT HAVE LASIX

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.954
WE'VE ALSO COMMITTED TO STAKES

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:26.088
RACES.

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:28.424
BEING LASIX FREE SO IT IS MY

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:31.761
HOPE THAT IN BY TWO THOUSAND

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:32.962
TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE THAT

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.264
WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE FORCES

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:36.565
RUNNING ON LASIX.

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:37.166
WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:37.867
THINGS.

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:40.603
THAT ARE I BELIEVE WE'RE SEEING

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.505
SOME OF THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES AS

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:45.007
IT RELATES TO THE PROTOCOLS MUCH

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:46.709
MORE STRINGENT PROTOCOLS.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.311
REGARDING WHICH HORSES TRAINED

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:49.679
AT OUR FACILITIES.

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:51.647
AND FOR EXAMPLE HAVING TO SIGN

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.983
UP FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN ADVANCE

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:55.084
WILL WORK OUT.

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:57.753
MEANS THAT THE APPROPRIATE TIME

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.288
CAN IS THERE FOR THE

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:00.823
INTERVENTION.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.558
IN CASE THERE ARE SOME COURSES

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.293
THAT MAY NEED THAT EXTRA

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.195
INTERVENTION WHERE WE TAKE A

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:07.496
SECOND LOOK AT IS THAT OF COURSE.

01:06:07.563 --> 01:06:10.700
TRULY FIT TO TRAIN.

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:13.202
WE ALSO MADE THE COMMITMENT TO

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:15.137
UP MAKE AVAILABLE STATE OF THE

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:17.473
ART DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:18.941
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT MANY OF

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:20.676
THE OWNERS AND TRAINERS ARE

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:22.345
UNAWARE OF SOME OF THE INJURIES

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:23.813
THAT THEIR HORSES MAY HAVE SOME

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:26.215
OF THOSE PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS.

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:27.717
SO TRUE TO OUR COMMITMENT OF

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:29.852
WHAT WE STATED WE HAVE INVESTED

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.821
IN THE ACQUISITION OF A P. E.

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:34.223
T.'S CAM WHICH DOCTOR BENSON CAN

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.157
SPEAK.

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:36.325
OF MUCH MORE KNOWLEDGE

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.893
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THAN THAN I

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.730
CAN -- THE OTHER THING THAT WE

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:43.232
ARE LOOKING AT AND HOW DO WE

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.600
ENHANCE THE TRIAGE PROGRAM.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:46.502
WHEN THERE IS AN INJURY ON THE

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:48.838
TRACK THAT THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:50.406
ATTENTION GIVEN TO THAT HORSE?

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:52.007
AND THAT NOT IN ALL CASES THAT

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:54.744
HORSE IS A EUTHANIZED THAT WE

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:55.945
REALLY TAKE A LOOK CAN THAT

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:57.446
HORSE BE SAVED.

01:06:57.513 --> 01:07:00.683
CAN -- CAN SURGERY OCCUR AND CAN

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.918
THAT HORSE BE THEN -- INTRODUCED

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:06.055
INTO ANOTHER ENVIRONMENT WHERE

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:09.258
IT CAN LIVE -- UP UP THE REST OF

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:10.292
HIS LIFE.

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:10.659
AND THE OTHER.

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:11.560
PART THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:12.395
WE ARE ALSO.

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:14.063
I BELIEVE MAKING VERY GOOD IN

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.265
ROADS IS THE AFTER CARE PROGRAMS

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:18.167
AND I KNOW THAT OTHERS WILL BE

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:20.403
SPEAKING ABOUT KARMA -- TO

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:22.271
FOLLOW.

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:24.206
SINCE WE HAVE REOPENED SENT TO

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:25.674
NEEDED JUST TO PUT A LITTLE

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:27.009
CONTEXT AROUND THINGS.

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:29.211
WE'VE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.679
THOUSAND SESSIONS ON THE TRACK

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:32.248
SO HUNDRED THOUSAND HORSES

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.016
WHETHER BE RACING TRAINING OR

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.217
WORKING OUT.

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:37.086
WE'VE HAD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.721
SINCE THE OPENING OF THE SEASON

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.289
SINCE THE TWENTY SIXTH OF

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:41.457
DECEMBER.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.058
WE'VE HAD FIFTEEN HUNDRED HORSES

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.795
RACING WE'VE HAD OVER SEVEN

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:49.231
THOUSAND WORKOUTS WHICH MEANS

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:50.733
THOUSAND HORSES GALLOPING.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.201
AND EVERY SINGLE DAY WE HAVE

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:55.237
ABOUT SEVENTEEN POINT SEVENTEEN

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:57.173
HUNDRED HORSES ON THE TRACK.

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.608
THOSE ARE VERY HIGH NUMBERS.

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:01.744
AS I SAID EARLIER AND CHAIRMAN

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.179
GRAY OPENED WITH THIS THAT.

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.880
CALIFORNIA RACING IS THE GOLD

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:07.483
STANDARD WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.552
RACING IS THE GOLD STANDARD.

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:10.953
HAVING MORE WORK I WOULD DO WELL

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.855
WE'VE COME QUITE AWAY WE DO

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:13.956
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS AN

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:15.424
ONGOING.

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:17.426
EXAMINATION THAT SHOULD OCCUR

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:18.828
CAM WE DO THINGS BETTER.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:19.929
TOGETHER WORKING WITH OUR

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:21.464
INDUSTRY PARTNERS CAN WE MAKE

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:23.466

INSTITUTE BETTER PRO PROTOCOLS --

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.506
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:31.974
TO SEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.909

CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT'S VERY

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:38.781
IMPORTANT THAT THE STANDARDS ARE

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:39.949
CONSISTENT.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:42.051
ALSO IMPORTANT IS THAT AS WE

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:43.886
HAVE THE GOLD STANDARD HEARING

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.721
CALIFORNIA IN NORTH AMERICA.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:46.856
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THE

01:08:46.922 --> 01:08:49.024
GOLD STANDARD MOVES ACROSS NORTH

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:51.193
AMERICA AND THAT THE ENTIRE

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.094
INDUSTRY.

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:53.529
LOOKS AT THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:55.064
HERE BECAUSE IF IT'S GOOD FOR

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.732
CALORIE CALIFORNIA RACING.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.334
AND GOOD FOR THE HORSES HERE AND

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.835
THE WRITERS IN CALIFORNIA IT

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:01.136
SHOULD ALSO BE.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.105
GOOD FOR HORSES ELSEWHERE IN THE

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:05.241
HEALTH AND WELFARE FORCES

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:05.841
ELSEWHERE.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.143
I'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE THAT THERE

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.178
IS GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN OUR

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:09.545
SPORT.

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:11.714
IN TERMS OF CONSISTENCY WITH

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.048
RESPECT TO REPORTING

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.650
CATASTROPHIC INJURY SO WE CAN

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:15.651
SEE.

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:17.486
WHO IS DOING IT RIGHT AND WHO

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:19.088
ISN'T DOING IT RIGHT?

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.589
AS WELL WITH RESPECT TO TRAINERS

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.224
WHEN THERE'S A TRAINER THAT HAS

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.926
AN INFRACTION IN ANOTHER STATE.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.095
WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT THERE

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:27.963
NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENCY THERE.

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:29.798
AS WELL WE'VE I THINK MADE GREAT

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:32.001
WRECKED PROGRESS TOGETHER WITH

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:33.202
THE C. H. R. B..

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:34.770
WHERE VETERINARY RECORD SHOULD

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.406
FOLLOW THE HORSE AND SHOULD BE

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:39.174
TRANSPARENT FROM THAT TO THAT?

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:41.343
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:42.077
AS I HEARD SOME OF THE SPEAKERS

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:44.513
BEFORE -- WE WE COULD HAVE DONE

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.080
THIS WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:46.849
CHUCK WINNER AND THE ENTIRE

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.250
SEIZURE BE THEY MOVED VERY

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:49.218
QUICKLY.

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:50.586
BUT I ALSO HAVE TO COMMEND MY

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:52.855
INDUSTRY PARTNERS BECAUSE IT WAS

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:55.324
BECAUSE OF THE COLLABORATION

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.859
WITH THE SEAT.

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:59.094
THE C. D. T. WITH THE TOC.

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:00.396
WITH THE JOCKEYS WITH DEL MAR

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:01.664
WHERE THE INDUSTRYGOT TOGETHER

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:02.998
AND SAID WE REALLY HAVE TO DO

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:03.933
SOMETHING.

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.434
AND I THINK BECAUSE WE GOT

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:06.569
TOGETHER AND IT WAS INDUSTRY

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:08.103
LEAD WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO MOVE

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.139
VERY QUICKLY.

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.241
THROUGH THESE CHANGES AND THE CA

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:13.976
TURBIE ALSO RESPECTED THAT AND

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:16.011
WAS ON THE SAME PAGE AS WE WORK

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:18.981
AND AND I BELIEVE IT WAS THAT.

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:21.483
A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.819
AND EVENTS AND DESIRE TO MAKE

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.754
CHANGE AND PROGRESS IN REFORMS

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:30.025
THAT HAS BROUGHT US TO WHERE WE

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:31.260
ARE TODAY.

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:33.896

AND RACING HISTORY IT REALLY

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.155
ALLOWS US TO GET A GOOD IDEA OF

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.735
A GAME CHANGER FOR US THERE IS A

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:55.204
SPECIFIC BONE ON THE BACK OF THE

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:56.805
HORSES ANKLE.

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:58.741
THAT THERE IS A A DEFECT THAT

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:00.976
CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED BY ANY

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:02.211
EXISTING.

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:05.047
TECHNOLOGY AND THE P. E. T. SCAN

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.082
WHICH THIS TRYING TO GROUP --

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:08.951
DONATED HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:13.122
FOR ITS IT'S ACQUISITION.

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:15.190
WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:16.525
IDENTIFY THOSE.

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:19.261
THOSE DEFICIENCIES ARE DEFECTS

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:21.230
AND TRULY THE ONE THING THAT I

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:22.464
AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:25.367
POSITION -- IS.

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:26.969
INNOVATION IS A BIG.

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:28.570
THING TO THIS COMPANY THEY

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:30.205
REALLY WANT TO FIND ANYTHING IF

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:31.373
THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WILL MAKE

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.474
HORSE RACING SAFER.

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:33.776
THEY ARE INTERESTED IN IT THEY

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:36.612
WANT TO LEARN ABOUT IT AND WE

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:37.846
REALLY WANT TO KNOW.

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.681
WHAT IF ANYTHING IS OUT THERE

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:40.749
THAT CAN MAKE HORSE RACING SAFE

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.417
THERE -- I DON'T I AM VERY

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:43.819
EXCITED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:45.220
COMING FROM A NON PROFIT WHERE

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:46.355
YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING NOT TO

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.190
SPEND ANY MONEY IT'S REALLY

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.259
EXCITING TO HAVE A COMPANY THAT

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:51.827
IS REALLY ENTHUSED ABOUT THESE

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:54.596
TYPES OF OF ADVANCES REALLY

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:58.200
WILLING TO INVEST IN THE SPORT --

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.902

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:01.904
CONSTRAINED BY.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.238
ANY LIMITATIONS ON WHAT WILL

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:04.573
MAKE COURSE RACING SAFER IF

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.074
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:07.476
MAY MAKE HORSE RACING SAFER.

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:08.877
WHETHER IT BE LOOKING AT

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.045
TRAINING PRACTICES I KNOW

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.446
EARLIER SOMEONE MENTIONED THE

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:12.548
NUMBER OF HIGH SPEED FOR A LONG

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:13.682
AS OF COURSE DOES.

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:14.483
WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.084
INFORMATION IN TRYING TO SEE IF

01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:17.753
THERE'S A WAY THAT AS IN

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.421
TRAINING WE CAN REGULATE THAT.

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:21.089
OR NOT TAKE ENTRIES OF A HORSE

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:23.091
HAS HAD TOO MANY HIGH SPEED FOR

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:24.793
A LONG FOR HIS TRAIN TOO MUCH

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.161
COMING UP TO A RACE OR WORK.

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:27.729
SO REALLY WE ARE LOOKING AT

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:29.231
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO MAKE

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.599
HORSE RACING SAFER.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:33.101

WORLD AND HAVE EVERYONE ASK WHAT

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.307
CALIFORNIA'S DOING [inaudible]

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:40.709
THANK YOU.

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:42.311
HI MY NAME'S MIKE ROGERS --

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:43.979
PRESIDENT STRONGER GROUP I'VE

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:44.580
BEEN AN EXECUTIVE WITH STRONG

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:46.682
RECOUP FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS I

01:14:46.748 --> 01:14:48.050
SIT ON VARIOUS INDUSTRY BOARDS

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:49.518
FOR THE BREEDERS CUP TO THE

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:51.286
INJURY TO THE T. R. A..

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:53.589
WELCOME BASS I HAVE NO FURTHER

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:56.124
COMMENTS -- TO ADD I'M HERE TO

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.594
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND SUPPORT

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.230
THESE TWO FANTASTIC.

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:04.066
CENTER BRADFORD YES DOCTOR YOU

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:05.334
MENTIONED A BONE BEHIND THE%

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.102
ANKLE WAS THAT THE MOST COMMON

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.838
BREAKDOWN IN THE GINGER'S THAT

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:10.305
WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR.

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:11.974
SO I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:12.808
ACTUAL NAY CROSSES THAT HAPPENED

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:15.744
THIS YEAR AND CERTAINLY I'VE NOT

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:16.311
BEEN ON THE STRENGTH OF LONG

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:16.545
ENOUGH.

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:17.412
BUT FOR THE MAJORITY OF INJURIES

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:20.048
THAT OCCUR IN HORSES ARE CENTER

01:15:20.115 --> 01:15:22.618
ON WHAT'S CALLED FAT LOCKER WHEN

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:23.185
YOU THINK ABOUT OTHERS THEIR

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:23.385
INFO.

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:24.019
AND THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE PLACE

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:24.920
THAT WE CANNOT CURRENTLY

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:25.754
DIAGNOSE ANY ISSUES SO WE'RE

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:27.623
HOPING THAT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:28.824
WILL ALLOW US.

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:38.467
TO REMOVE THAT BLIND SPOT.

01:15:38.533 --> 01:15:40.168
FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER GREAT.

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:41.870
CHAIRMAN.

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.839
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN --

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:45.240
WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU. FOR

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:47.809
YOUR TESTIMONY AND CERTAINLY.

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:52.514
I WILL COMMAND THE STRATA GROUP.

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:53.582
FOR GETTING OUT GRASS OF LEE --

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:54.950
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW I

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.919
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF Là

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:58.287
DESIST REMAINS THE ON WHAT THE

01:15:58.353 --> 01:15:59.821
SOLUTIONS MAY OR MAY NOT BE.

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.424
AND WHERE THE QUESTIONS A BITE

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.059
TO EAT ADDRESS TO THE

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:08.163
VETERINARIAN.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.465
DR INTO THIS YOU KNOW.

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:11.967
SON THERE'S CRITICISM OUT THERE

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:15.671
THAT FOR EXAMPLE -- CHANGES TO

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:20.108
THE USEFUL -- AND MY SIX DON'T

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:20.742
MESS TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:21.109
THE BREAKDOWN.

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.110
HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:22.577
CRITICISM [inaudible]

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:24.346
SO.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.380
LASIX MAY NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:26.248
DO WITH BREAKDOWN SPECIFICALLY

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:27.582
FOR FRANKLY THE RESEARCH WE

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:28.483
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RESEARCH

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:29.051
WOULD BE I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:31.987
ANYONE IS EVER TAKEN A LONG TERM --

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:33.855
LOOK AT WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.058
ANY CHANGE IN THE BREEDING OR

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:36.692
ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT HAS TO

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:38.327
DO WITH.

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:39.895
THE ABILITY TO USE LASIX SO

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:41.730
CERTAINLY THAT'S A QUESTION THAT

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.365
I CAN'T ANSWER BUT I DO KNOW

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.766
THAT BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES.

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.668
ARE SIGNIFICANT PERCEPTION

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.403
ISSUES FOR THE PUBLIC AND AT THE

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.272
END OF THE DAY IF PEOPLE DON'T

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:51.907
WANT TO COME TO RACING BECAUSE

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:52.941
THEY FEEL THAT.

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:55.143
COURSES ARE WHIPS OR THAT THEY

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.345
HAVE TO HAVE MEDICATION TO

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:56.611
COMPETE.

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:59.381
THEN WE DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT IN

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.515
WE NEED WE NEED TO BE DOING THE

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:03.085
BEST THING NOT ONLY FOR THE

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:05.887
HORSES BUT FOR THE SPORT.

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.023
I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AND SHE

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.523
TO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:10.158
PERCEPTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:11.326
DOES LIVE THROUGH AN OBVIOUSLY

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:12.761
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE THE

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:15.497
STRONGER COOPER ANY OTHER -- YOU

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:16.365
KNOW INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDER CAN

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:16.932
IGNORE.

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.433
IT'S A SPORT THERE ARE FANS AND

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.501
YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:20.635
PUBLIC AND APPROPRIATE MANNER

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:21.670
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS.

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:23.171
BUT AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS A

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:29.544
EDUCATION ROOTED IN SCIENCE.

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:31.113
NOT ALL OF US HERE AT THE

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:32.414
LEGISLATURE ALWAYS.

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.416
DO A GOOD JOB OF ROUTING OUR

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:35.417
DECISIONS IN SCIENCE AND DATA.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.119
AND IT'S CERTAINLY STRIKES ME AS

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:38.920
ODD WE LOOK IN -- WE ARE WE

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:41.490
LOOKING OTHER STATES AND WE ARE

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:42.791
WITH THESE CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:45.127
IN YOU SEE -- FATALITIES DOWN

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:45.927
YOU LOOK EVEN YOU KNOW WE HAD

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:46.962
SOME DISCUSSION INTERNATIONAL

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:48.997
STANDARDS RIGHT AND CERTAINLY

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:51.433
AGAIN I APPLIED -- THE PURSUIT

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.437
OF THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN ANY.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:58.607
IN ANY CONCERTS -- BUT EVEN

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:00.308
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THERE

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.477
ARE FATALITIES -- SO SOME OF THE

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:03.912
STRIKES ME AND I'LL CONTRACTORS

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:05.547
QUESTION OPEN AND LEADER WHOEVER

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:08.050
MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IT -- HOW DO

01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:09.418
WE ADDRESS THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:13.255
ISSUES THAT JUST FRANKLY DON'T

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:13.889
REALLY LINE UP WITH IT AND WE'RE

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.190
WE'RE YOU'LL FATALITIES ARE DOWN?

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:16.925
AND YET WE'RE HAVING A HEARING

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:18.527
HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS WHAT

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:19.828
PEOPLE EARLY SOME OF THE

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:22.330
PRESSURE OR OTHER PERCEPTION

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:26.101
FOLKS MY AND COHEN A CRISIS --

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:27.302
AND AGAIN IF IF THE RESULT OF

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.338
ALL THAT IS IS A CONTINUATION.

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:32.140
OF THE GOLD STANDARD HERE IN

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:34.309
CALIFORNIA OR PERHAPS MAKING IT

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.477
THE PLATINUM STANDARD.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.080
THEN -- THAT'S A GOOD THING TO

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:38.680
GET THE FOR THE INDUSTRY IT'S

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:40.749
GOOD TO BE A SUPPORT GROUP OF

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:41.049
CALIFORNIA.

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:41.850
BUT WITH THAT YOU KNOW HOW DO

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:46.388
YOU SEE THE PERCEPTION ISSUES

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.958
GOING FORWARD -- HELLO DOCTOR

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:50.725
BENSON TALK TO THE SCIENCE OF

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:52.160
THE I'LL TALK TO THE PERCEPTION.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.862
SO -- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OUR

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:55.163
OUR INDUSTRY IS ONE THAT IS IN

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:55.564
DECLINE.

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:56.865
SO WE HAVE A REAL CHALLENGE HOW

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:58.834
DO WE WANT TO GET THOSE NEW FANS

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.902
NEW GUESTS ARE INDUSTRY -- THAT

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:02.471
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:07.409
TO ATTRACT -- DOES NOT WISH TO

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:08.944
SEE HORSES BEING DRUGGED.

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.745
OR RUNNING ON MEDICATION.

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:11.947
THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE HORSES

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:13.415
RUNNING ON PAGE OR TRAINING ON

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:15.083
PAIN MEDICATION.

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.685
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:18.019
EXCESSIVE USE OF THE WEB FOR THE

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:18.487
CROP.

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:19.988
THOSE ARE THE VALUES THAT WE

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:22.390
ALSO EMBRACE IF IF WE DON'T

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:23.792
INCREASE THOSE VALUES.

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:26.161
THERE WILL BE A CONTINUATION A

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:27.562
CLIENT OF OUR BUSINESS -- IN OUR

01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:29.531
INDUSTRY SO BUT THOSE ARE ALSO

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.733
VALUES THAT THAT WE DO EMBRACE

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.201
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT OF COURSE

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:36.171
WELFARE -- AND WRITER WELFARE

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:39.508

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:44.045
MAKE SURE THAT.

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:47.015
IT WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:50.952
ALSO -- THAT WE ADVOCATE FOR

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:52.888

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:55.357
THE COUNTRY.

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:56.525
THAT WE WE HAVE A UNIFORM

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:58.393
PLATFORM IN NORTH AMERICA.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.096
I'M OFTEN ASKED WELL IF THEY CAN

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:03.532
RUN IN IN EUROPE WITHOUT LASIX

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:04.566
WHY CAN'T YOU.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.234
IF THEY CAN RUN THE DUBAI WORLD

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.036

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:11.139
SO IT.

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:11.973
PERHAPS SOME OF ITS PERCEPTION

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:12.841
ISSUE.

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.143
PERHAPS -- THE SCIENCE YOU KNOW

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.612
THERE IS MIXED -- DEBATE AROUND

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.814
THE SCIENCE DOES IT CONTRIBUTE.

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:21.016
TO CATASTROPHIC INJURY INJURIES

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:23.718
OR DOES IT CONTRIBUTE TO A A

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:29.024
WEAKENING OF THE THOROUGHBRED --

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.226
FREE -- THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:32.460
THAT'S A QUESTION FOR SCIENCE

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:34.996
BUT FROM A PERCEPTION STANDPOINT

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:36.865
FROM THE NEW GUESTS THAT WE WISH

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:38.733
TO ATTRACT.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.768
WE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:45.740
THOSE VALUES [inaudible] SEVEN

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:46.675

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:08.530
THAT FORWARD TO MAKE THINGS

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:10.565
BETTER IS THERE ANY PLAN IS

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:11.533

PLANTED TO IN TERMS OF CHANGING

01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:18.707
PERCEPTION.

WELL I THINK THE YOU KNOW

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:21.543
HOPEFULLY THE ACTIONS WE TAKE

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.144
THE REAL ACTIONS THAT THE

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.446
REFORMS THE CHANGE.

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:26.081
WILL HELP TO CHANGE PERCEPTIONS

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:28.016
THIS ISN'T A PR STUNT WE'RE NOT

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:30.285
DOING THIS FOR FOR GOOD PR WE'RE

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:32.020
TRYING TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHAT

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:33.622
ARE THOSE MEETING FULL CONCRETE

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:35.223
REFORMS THAT WE COULDN'T PLAY

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:37.592
PUT CAN PUT IN PLACE.

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:39.561
THE TRULY AFFECT THE OUTCOME --

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.129
AT THE END OF THE DAY AND THEN.

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:42.163
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:44.499
UPON ALL OF US IN THE INDUSTRY

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:46.434
TO ADVOCATE THE POSITIVES THAT

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:48.837
OUR INDUSTRY -- AND OUR SPORT

01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:50.071
DOES BRING.

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:52.140
AND WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW --

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:54.743
JOBS THE LOVE OF HORSES THE

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.244
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT WORK IN

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:57.178
OUR INDUSTRY.

01:21:57.245 --> 01:21:58.747
AND THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE ARE

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:00.448
MAKING CONCRETE IMPROVEMENTS

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:02.017
WITH RESPECT TO HORSE WELFARE

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.151
AND WRITER WELFARE.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.486
THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVE TO

01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:08.523
COLLECTIVELY KEEP.

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:09.858
KEEP -- KEEP TALKING ABOUT.

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:10.392
THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:12.193
APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE NOT

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.595
TAKING IT AS A PUPPY SPLIT THIS

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:15.563
EAST ON BECAUSE CLEARLY -- SOME

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:17.499
HORSES HALF HAVE DIED BUT IN THE

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.301
REASON I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT IS

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:20.135
MY DISTRICT.

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:22.103
NAKED CALLS ALL THE TIME ABOUT

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.772
THE NUMBERS OF COURSE IS THAT

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:25.373
DIED IN IT'S NOT ACCURATE I

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.676
DON'T KNOW HOW. TO ACCURATELY

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.944
DEFENDED -- AND I'M NOT TRYING

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:30.979
TO I'M TRYING TO JUST MAKE SURE

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:32.314
TO BE HONEST YOU KNOW BUT MY

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.481
POINT IS THAT.

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:35.417
THE MESSAGE KEEPS GETTING BIGGER

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:37.252
AND BIGGER BY THAI PEOPLE HEAR

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:38.887
IT AND AND I KNOW IT'S JUST A

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:40.355
SUGGESTION BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:41.523
THERE'S INFORMATION TO BE

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:42.691
CLARIFIED.

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:44.926
IT IS WOULD BE HELPFUL SO PEOPLE

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.261
DON'T BLOW THINGS OUT OF

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:49.197
PROPORTION SO BUT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:53.301
JUST A LITTLE WORK TO DO.

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:56.304
THANK YOU -- BUT YOU SAW THE

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:58.306
FINAL QUESTION YOU KNOW.

01:22:58.373 --> 01:22:59.107
OR I'LL START WITH THE STATE AND

01:22:59.174 --> 01:22:59.741
THEN JUST HAVE YOU COMMENT ON IT

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:00.642
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE INDUSTRY

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:03.778
HAS TO HAVE BETTER METRICS.

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:05.213
I MEAN WE'VE HAD THIS SAY

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:05.947
THERE'S TWENTY SIXTH.

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:06.548
TWENTY FIVE YES THIS YEAR BUT

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:07.182
THEN WE HEAR.

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:08.083
ABOUT HOW WAR AT THE LOWEST

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:09.451
POINT THAT WE'VE BEEN A LONG

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:12.153
TIME IN THE INDUSTRY AND YOU

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.256
KNOW THOSE. TWO IMPORTANT --

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:18.226
DATA SETS ARE CONFLICTING IT'S

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:21.162
SO WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE -- THAT

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.731
ARE -- YOU KNOW AND NOT AS UP ON

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:27.369
IT AS YOU ALL ARE -- THEN YOU

01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:28.703
GET THESE PERCEPTIONS.

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.705
IS SO PERCEPTIONS ASIDE WE STILL

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.741
AT TWENTY FIVE ANIMALS DIED THIS

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:33.675
YEAR.

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:36.444
AND I THINK THE INDUSTRY SHOULD

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:37.512
COME UP WITH.

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:41.249
SOME METRICS SO THAT -- NOT THAT

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:42.984
THERE -- IT'S NOT LIKE PUTTING

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.186
LIPSTICK ON A PIG IF YOU WILL

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:48.089
IT'S REALLY HARD CORE THESE ARE

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:51.493
HOW MANY RUNS A WE HAVE THIS.

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:54.162
IT IN IN MAYBE CITING SOME

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:56.564
STATISTICS -- YOU OFFER A LOT

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:58.032
FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OR

01:23:58.099 --> 01:23:59.100
YOU KNOW SOME POINT IN TIME THIS

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:01.770
JUST MAY BE -- AN ABERRATION I

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:02.370
DON'T KNOW CAN YOU COMMENT ON

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:07.809
THAT. FIFTY CREATURE SURE --

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:11.646
THERE IS A A DATABASE THAT RACE

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.314
TRACKS ARE INVITED TO USE IN

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:14.249
THAT ALL OF THE STRONG A GROUP

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:15.383
TRACKS TO USE IT'S CALLED THE

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:16.818
EQUINE ENTRY DATABASE THAT

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.920
TRACKS THE NUMBER OF INJURIES.

01:24:18.987 --> 01:24:23.124
OVER TIME FOR HORSES AND WHEN I

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:25.860
STARTED IN THIS INDUSTRY SEVEN

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:29.164
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.433
TOO WEIRD TWO PER THOUSAND

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:34.436
CATASTROPHIC INJURIES -- PER

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:35.837
THOUSAND INSTANCES OF RACING.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:38.072
WE ARE NOW DOWN AS AN INDUSTRY

01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:39.641
ABOUT ONE POINT.

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:40.809
EIGHT L..

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:42.310
THAT IS CERTAINLY A GREAT

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:44.345
IMPROVEMENT AND BUT I DON'T

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:44.946
THINK ANYONE FEELS THAT WERE

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:47.048
DONE AND YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:47.849
OTHER COUNTRIES AND THERE ARE

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.384
SOME THAT ARE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.853
LOWER -- I DON'T THINK WE EVEN

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:52.921
NEED TO SHOOT FOR WHAT OTHER

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:55.757
COUNTRIES DO I THINK OUR GOAL IS --

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.292
ZERO PER THOUSAND WE MAY NEVER

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:59.794
GET THERE BUT I THINK WE WILL

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:02.797
CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS THAT --

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:04.499
YOU KNOW AND AND THAT IS

01:25:04.566 --> 01:25:05.700
ULTIMATELY THE GOAL.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:09.971
I ALSO THINK THAT IF YOU -- LOOK

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:14.676
AT THE NUMBERS.

01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:14.909
SINCE.

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:17.278
THE REFORMS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN.

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:20.114
WERE AT 2% IN THOUSAND OR TWO

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:22.016
PER EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED ACTUALLY

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:22.584
WHEN YOU INCLUDE RACING SO

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.352
THAT'S CERTAINLY AN IMPROVEMENT

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:25.820
FROM WHERE WE HAVE BEEN AND WE

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:27.622
CONTINUE. TO HOPE THAT TREND

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:28.790
CONTINUES.

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:30.325
BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:32.427
TOWARDS ZERO NO MATTER WHAT

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.295
WE'RE DOING WHAT NUMBER WERE AT

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:36.231
AT THE TIME.

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:38.032
LET'S IN LESS SOMEBODY HAS

01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:38.700

[inaudible]

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.954
QUESTIONS.

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:23.857
I'VE GOT -- ONE I I I MENTIONED

01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:24.892
THIS EARLIER AND I JUST WANT TO

01:39:24.958 --> 01:39:27.561
GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE PERHAPS --

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:28.662
THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE STATS

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:32.366
HERE CALIFORNIA COMPARED -- TO

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:35.069
YOU OVERSEAS IN TERMS OF COURSE

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:36.403
YEAH DOUBTS IN AGAIN.

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:37.137
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY

01:39:37.204 --> 01:39:39.106
SPECIFIC METRICS EXCEPT.

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:40.774
FOR YEAH WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:43.911
YEAR SO FAR CAN YOU COMMENT ON

01:39:43.977 --> 01:39:44.478
THAT ANY THOUGHT YOU HAVE ON

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:45.346
THAT [inaudible]

01:39:45.412 --> 01:39:47.114
WELL THE I THINK IT'S ALWAYS

01:39:47.181 --> 01:39:48.682
IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE

01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:50.751
WE'RE COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES --

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:51.919
AND THAT'S AND I THINK THAT'S

01:39:51.985 --> 01:39:53.387
THE FIRST QUESTION WHEN WHEN WE

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:54.321
SAY.

01:39:54.388 --> 01:39:56.990
BUT WE DO ABOUT THE U. S. VERSUS --

01:39:57.057 --> 01:39:59.526
OF EUROPEAN OR INTERNATIONAL

01:39:59.593 --> 01:40:02.196
STANDARDS -- WE WE IN THIS

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:03.464
COUNTRY I HAVE A ONE METRIC I'M

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:06.100
NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT HAPPENS --

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:08.469
IN EUROPE -- I THINK IT'S

01:40:08.535 --> 01:40:09.503
IMPORTANT MEMBER THEY RAISE

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:11.805
PRIMARILY ON ON GRASS -- AND

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:12.906
SYNTHETIC WHERE AS WE RACE ON

01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:13.841
DIRT THAT'S A DIFFERENT

01:40:13.907 --> 01:40:16.076
EXPERIENCE ENTIRELY -- THOSE

01:40:16.143 --> 01:40:17.211
THINGS AFFECT THOSE NUMBERS AS

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:20.647
WELL -- BUT ANYWAY YOU SLICE IT

01:40:20.714 --> 01:40:23.350
THE THE US NEEDS TO IMPROVE ON

01:40:23.417 --> 01:40:24.651
OUR A FATALITY RATE --

01:40:24.718 --> 01:40:26.687
NATIONWIDE AND AND IT LETTER

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.288
EVERY LEVEL -- WE NEED TO BE

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:30.891
BELOW EUROPE -- WERE EVERY TIAS --

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:33.026
BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND AMERICAN

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:35.295
PUBLIC WANTS THAT -- THAT'S NOT

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.997
ONLY TRUE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S

01:40:37.064 --> 01:40:38.465
THAT'S TRUE ACROSS THE COUNTRY --

01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:40.334
AND SO WE WANTED TO MEET AND

01:40:40.401 --> 01:40:43.036
EXCEED YOUR AND AND IT'S IT'S

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:45.406
IT'S STANDARD -- THINK IT'S

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:46.874
SOMETHING TO SHOOT FOR BUT WE'VE

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.242
MADE PROGRESS AND I'M PROUD TO

01:40:48.308 --> 01:40:49.777
SAY WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:51.412
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND

01:40:51.478 --> 01:40:53.247
AND WITH THESE NEW REFORMS.

01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:54.114
THAT HAVE COME ALONG IN

01:40:54.181 --> 01:40:55.516
CALIFORNIA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE

01:40:55.582 --> 01:40:56.950
SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ACROSS THE

01:40:57.017 --> 01:40:58.419
COUNTRY AS WELL AND I'M EXCITED

01:40:58.485 --> 01:41:00.654
TO DIG INTO. TO THE THE THINGS

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:01.989
YOU'VE DONE HERE ALL THE THINGS

01:41:02.055 --> 01:41:02.956
YOU'VE DONE HERE TO SEE WHAT WE

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:03.557
CAN.

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:06.059
IMPLEMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY --

01:41:06.126 --> 01:41:12.499
TO TO BRING FATALITIES DOWN IN

01:41:12.566 --> 01:41:14.735
OTHER IN OTHER STATES.

01:41:14.802 --> 01:41:15.969
AND YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED AS

01:41:16.036 --> 01:41:17.337
APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED YOU YOU

01:41:17.404 --> 01:41:17.905
MENTIONED.

01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:18.839
THE UNITED STATES VERSUS

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:19.273
EUROPEAN AND OTHER.

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:20.107
FOREIGNERS BUT WHAT ABOUT WITHIN

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:20.774
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MY

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:21.341
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:22.309
STATES.

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:23.377
ARE ALLOWING US YOU KNOW.

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:24.645
SOME THINGS THAT OTHER STATES

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:26.280
DON'T DESERVE.

01:41:26.346 --> 01:41:27.815
WHAT'S THE UNIFORMITY LOOK LIKE

01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:31.452
AMONG THE STATES IN IN AMERICA.

01:41:31.518 --> 01:41:33.754
WELL -- IT COULD BE BETTER -- WE

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.556
HAVE WE HAVE THE THE MID

01:41:35.622 --> 01:41:37.024
ATLANTIC THE THERE ARE I THINK

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:39.226
ELEVEN STATES FROM NEW YORK --

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:41.228
DOWN THROUGH VIRGINIA THAT WORK

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:42.496
TOGETHER AND THEY'RE VERY CLOSE

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:44.898
IN IN PROXIMITY SO THEY HAVE A

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:45.833
GREAT DEAL OF UNIFORMITY IN IN

01:41:45.899 --> 01:41:50.103
THAT AREA -- BEYOND THAT THERE

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:51.738
AND THERE'S NO ONE REGION -- THE

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:53.307
NATIONAL UNIFORMITY CATION

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:53.974
PROGRAM.

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:56.176
HAS SUBSTANTIAL UNIFORMITY BUT

01:41:56.243 --> 01:41:58.145
IT NEEDS TO BE ADOPTED IN

01:41:58.212 --> 01:41:59.513
CERTAIN MAJOR STATES INCLUDING

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.348
CALIFORNIA WE SAID TO MAKE TO

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:02.449
HAVE PERFECT.

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:04.117
UNIFORMITY SO THERE'S WORK TO BE

01:42:04.184 --> 01:42:05.552
DONE THERE IS NO QUESTION WE

01:42:05.619 --> 01:42:06.453
NEED TO ACT FASTER AND WE NEED

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.688
TO GET THAT DONE THE HORSES ARE

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:08.722
TRAVELING AROUND THE COUNTRY

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:09.990
THEY'RE GOING TO ALL THESE

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:11.425
DIFFERENT REGIONS TO RACE IS

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:12.092
THAT CORRECT THAT'S TRUE.

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:12.826
SO IS THERE A NATIONAL

01:42:12.893 --> 01:42:14.328
ASSOCIATION THAT'S LOOKING AT

01:42:14.394 --> 01:42:16.263
THESE ISSUES TO TRY TO GET IT

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:18.365
UNIFORM WELL THAT'S WHAT THE RTC

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:19.199
IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THE

01:42:19.266 --> 01:42:20.567
ALLIANCE DO TOGETHER THEY WORK

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:22.369
HAND IN GLOVE. TO ESTABLISH THE

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:24.238
UNIFORM PROGRAM AND TO IMPLEMENT

01:42:24.304 --> 01:42:25.639
THE PROGRAM AND AND THAT'S

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:27.074
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THOSE TWO

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.542
ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON NOT

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:30.377
EXCLUSIVELY BUT THAT'S A BIG

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:33.013
PART OF WHAT THEY DO -- AND SO

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.182
IT'S UP TO TO US IF YOU WILL TO

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:37.150
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND THEN YOU

01:42:37.217 --> 01:42:38.552
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:40.387
THERE'S A UNITED STATES IS

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:41.855
MOSTLY DIRT EUROPE IS MOSTLY.

01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:45.325
GRASS AND ARTIFICIAL TURF IS OUR

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:46.260
ARTIFICIAL.

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:47.294
YEAH THERE ARE ARTIFICIAL

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:49.963
SERVICES OR WE HAVE SOME OF

01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:51.431
THOSE WHO REJECT -- THE SOULS

01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:52.332
WITH AMONGST THE DIFFERENT

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:59.172
REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IS

01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:01.441
THERE ARE DIFFERENT ARE THE THE

01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:02.175
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:03.577
DIRT OR IS IT PRETTY MUCH THE

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:05.045
SAME AS WELL I'M GONNA I'M GONNA

pUNIFORMITY.

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:10.350
WELL I THINK I THINK I'M GOING

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:11.585
TO DEFER TO DOCTOR PETERSON

01:43:11.652 --> 01:43:12.719

KNOWS A LOT ABOUT HOW.

01:43:17.691 --> 01:43:19.259
A GOOD DIRT TRACK COULD BE AS

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:20.060
SAFE AS A AS A SYNTHETIC TRACK

01:43:20.127 --> 01:43:20.694
BUT SO HE'LL HE'LL EXPLAIN THAT

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:23.830
LATER BUT THAT'S AN AREA WHERE

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:27.434
WE NEED TO IMPROVE -- I IT'S GOT

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:28.001
TO BE REALLY QUICK BECAUSE I

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:21.014
THE FOREFRONT OF THESE EFFORTS.

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:22.916
OF WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WE

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:24.518
REFER TO THE MAINTENANCE QUALITY

01:45:24.584 --> 01:45:26.086
SYSTEM THAT'S IMPLEMENTED A

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:27.421
DOZEN OF THE TOP TRACKS IN THE

01:45:27.487 --> 01:45:28.655
UNITED STATES.

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:31.758
OF THOSE THAT INCLUDES DEL MAR

01:45:31.825 --> 01:45:32.859
AND SANTA ANITA.

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:35.328
IT'S A THREE PHASE PROCESS THAT

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:36.630
WE USE WERE.

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:38.465
SAMPLES ARE TAKEN FROM THE

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:39.833
RACETRACK SURFACE AND ARE

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:42.035
UTILIZED AND ARE TESTED AT OUR

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:44.237
FACILITIES IN LEXINGTON KENTUCKY

01:45:44.304 --> 01:45:45.806
THERE'S A SERIES OF TWELVE TESTS

01:45:45.872 --> 01:45:48.675
TO VERIFY THE COMPOSITION OF THE

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:49.843
MATERIAL.

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:50.610
THOSE TESTS THROUGH THEN DONE%

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.212
FROM SEVEN LOCATIONS ON THE

01:45:52.279 --> 01:45:54.314
TRACK IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:56.450
CONSISTENCY -- SPATIALLY ON THE

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:57.484
TRACK THAT'S DONE BEFORE EVERY

01:45:57.551 --> 01:46:00.320
RACE MEET IN THE CASE OF A LONG

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:01.655
RACE MEET LIKE SANTA NEEDED

01:46:01.722 --> 01:46:03.590
STUNT SEASONALLY DURING -- IT'S

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:05.358
DONE BEFORE THE WINTER SEASON

01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:06.960
STARTS AND BEFORE THE SUMMER

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:09.796
SEASON BECAUSE THERE'S TYPICALLY

01:46:09.863 --> 01:46:12.666
SOME BIG CHANGES AT THAT POINT --

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:14.000
THEN PRIOR TO EACH RACE MEET WE

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:15.702
HAVE A CERTIFICATION PROCESS

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:16.703
THAT WE GO THROUGH THIS IS

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:18.605
CONSISTENT WITH -- WHAT'S DONE

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:21.742
IN A LOT OF OTHER SPORTS SOCCER --

01:46:21.808 --> 01:46:24.444
RUGBY AMERICAN FOOTBALL DOES NOT

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:26.813
TO IT OF WHERE WE USE A

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.448
BIOMECHANICAL SURFACE TESTER

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:30.117
THAT'S BECOME AN INTERNATIONAL

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:31.718
STANDARD THAT WAS ALSO DEVELOPED

01:46:31.785 --> 01:46:33.286
USING -- HERE IN SOUTHERN

01:46:33.353 --> 01:46:35.288
CALIFORNIA I WAS IN MAINE AND

01:46:35.355 --> 01:46:36.757
COLORADO WHILE WE WERE

01:46:36.823 --> 01:46:38.892
DEVELOPING IT THERE WAS

01:46:38.959 --> 01:46:40.227
CALIFORNIA THAT LED THAT EFFORT.

01:46:40.293 --> 01:46:41.461
OF WE ALSO USE GROUND

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:43.296
PENETRATING RADAR TO VERIFY THE

01:46:43.363 --> 01:46:46.233
SURFACE BEFORE EACH RACE MEET --

01:46:46.299 --> 01:46:47.667
THAT'S IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR

01:46:47.734 --> 01:46:48.535
WITH GROUND PENETRATING RADAR

01:46:48.602 --> 01:46:49.970
THAT'S LIKE IF YOU WATCH THE

01:46:50.036 --> 01:46:51.938
FORENSIC TV SHOWS WHERE YOU'RE

01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:53.340
LOOKING FOR THE BODY THAT'S THE

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:55.442
SAME TECHNOLOGY WE USE THAT TO

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:55.809
VERIFY.

01:46:55.876 --> 01:46:59.579
THE SUBSURFACE OF THE TRACK.

01:46:59.646 --> 01:47:01.515
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THEN IS

01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:04.584
THAT SHOWS THAT THE SURFACE OF

01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:06.153
THAT SHOWS THAT THE SERVICE IS

01:47:06.219 --> 01:47:07.988
APPLICABLES CANDIES CAN BE

01:47:08.054 --> 01:47:08.922
SAFELY AND SAFE THING

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:10.557
CONSISTENTLY USE SO IN

01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:11.658
PARTICULAR IN SOUTHERN

01:47:11.725 --> 01:47:12.726
CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY'RE

01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:14.094
SWITCHING FROM SANTA NEEDED TO

01:47:14.161 --> 01:47:17.197
DEL MAR -- THAT THE SURFACE TO

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:18.632
MAKE SURE THAT THE HORSES HAVE A

01:47:18.698 --> 01:47:21.334
SIMILAR SERVICE TO RACE ON AT

01:47:21.401 --> 01:47:23.403
DEL MAR THE AS THEY DID ITS AND

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:24.471
THE NEED.

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:27.007
TO WE THEN HAVE A PROTOCOL THAT

01:47:27.073 --> 01:47:29.810
USE DAILY FOR DOCUMENTATION OF

01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:32.579
THE RACING SURFACE MAINTENANCE.

01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:33.814
A WEATHER STATION THE LOGS THE

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.282
DATED EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTE

01:47:35.348 --> 01:47:36.917
INTERVAL MOISTURE CONTENT

01:47:36.983 --> 01:47:38.385
MEASUREMENTS TO MAKE AND ARE

01:47:38.451 --> 01:47:40.320
TAKEN EVERY DAY -- PRIOR TO

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:43.723
RACING AND ALSO DOWNLOADED TO A

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:46.593
RELATIONAL DATABASE.

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:49.162
OUR GOAL IN THIS IS TO TREAT A

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:51.832
RACE TRACK LIKE YOU WOULD A AN

01:47:51.898 --> 01:47:54.401
AIRPLANE WE EVERYBODY SAT ON THE

01:47:54.467 --> 01:47:55.368
TARMAC WILL BE PREPARED THE RARE

01:47:55.435 --> 01:47:57.437
AIRPLANE TO GET READY TO GO

01:47:57.504 --> 01:47:59.005
WHERE THERE'S A CHECKLIST.

01:47:59.072 --> 01:48:00.574
IT NEEDS TO BE CERTIFIED ALL THE

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.108
MAINTENANCE IS DONE.

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:03.076
AND THEN THE MAINTENANCE IS

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:05.545
CERTIFIED BY A SECOND PERSON WHO

01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:06.613
DOES A CHECKLIST.

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:08.815
OUR INTENT IS.

01:48:08.882 --> 01:48:10.851
TO CREATE A SAFETY CRITICAL

01:48:10.917 --> 01:48:12.586
SERVICE.

01:48:12.652 --> 01:48:13.820
WHICH THE RACING SERVICES IS

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:15.655
SAFETY CRITICAL.

01:48:15.722 --> 01:48:17.424
PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT USED

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:20.126
EVERY DAY WE'RE RISKING BOTH

01:48:20.193 --> 01:48:22.395
RIDERS AND HORSES ON THOSE

01:48:22.462 --> 01:48:23.563
SERVICES.

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:24.698
AND SO IT NEEDS THE SAME

01:48:24.764 --> 01:48:26.099
STANDARDS OF CARE THAT WE THAT

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:29.803
WE WOULD PUT INTO A AIRPLANE

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:32.105
BEFORE WE BEFORE WE LET.

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.907
PASSENGERS FLYING ON IT

01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:34.207
[inaudible]

01:48:34.274 --> 01:48:37.878
SO -- I WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR

01:48:37.944 --> 01:48:40.747
QUESTIONS WE'VE GOT TO IMPROVE

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.449
WE'RE AT WE'RE WHERE WE ARE --

01:48:42.515 --> 01:48:44.851
AND WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE AT THIS

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:47.387
POINT BUT THIS IS RACING

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:49.589
SERVICES NEED TO IMPROVE AND WE

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:50.824
NEED TO GO FORWARD THEM OPEN FOR

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:53.593
QUESTIONS.

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:55.028
REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE

01:48:55.095 --> 01:48:56.496
TO FLY OUT HERE FROM KENTUCKY I

01:48:56.563 --> 01:49:00.000
DID AND WITH A REALLY NICE SEVEN

01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:01.468
SEVEN POWER POINT SLIDES THAT

01:49:01.534 --> 01:49:03.403
WITH NICE PICTURES AND

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:06.072
EVERYTHING.

01:49:06.139 --> 01:49:08.174
BUT IT'S ALL OVER ALL TAKE THE

01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:12.579
CLIP LOCAL BACK TO MY OFFICE --

01:49:12.646 --> 01:49:14.948
MAKE SURE YOU GET OF EVEN THE NO

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:15.782
I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:49:15.849 --> 01:49:17.884
BEING HERE I GUESS I I GUESS

01:49:17.951 --> 01:49:22.255
BECAUSE IT'S FORGET.

01:49:22.322 --> 01:49:23.657
DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:24.758
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE CALIFORNIA

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:26.359
YOU'RE AN EXPERT AT THE AT RACE

01:49:26.426 --> 01:49:29.529
TRACKS -- YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF I

01:49:29.596 --> 01:49:30.830
MISSED IN YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:31.898
WHAT'S HAPPENED OUT HERE

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:33.900
PARTICULARLY AT THE THE OTHER

01:49:33.967 --> 01:49:36.002
ONE RACE TRACK AND SEE IF YOU'VE

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:37.971
GOT ANY COMMENTS -- YEAH

01:49:38.038 --> 01:49:39.105
RELATIVE TO THAT WELL WHAT THE

01:49:39.172 --> 01:49:40.573
WEATHER IS UNUSUAL THERE'S NO

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.442
QUESTION ABOUT THAT I MEAN WE TO

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:43.810
DO THE PEOPLE MENTIONED OTHER

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:44.778
THIRTEEN INCHES OF RAIN OUR ON

01:49:44.844 --> 01:49:46.246
SITE WEATHER GAGE HAD SEVENTEEN

01:49:46.313 --> 01:49:47.781
INCHES OF RAIN OVER THAT'S OVER

01:49:47.847 --> 01:49:49.082
THAT -- OVER THAT TWO MONTH

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:54.955
PERIOD I MEAN YOU WE SEE THAT A

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:56.289
LOT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

01:49:56.356 --> 01:49:58.458
BUT THE CHALLENGES THIS IS ALSO

01:49:58.525 --> 01:50:00.860
RACING SURFACE IT HAS TO BE USED --

01:50:00.927 --> 01:50:03.129
DURING YOUR DRY HOT SUMMERS IN

01:50:03.196 --> 01:50:05.999
ARCADIA SO THE CHALLENGES TO PUT

01:50:06.066 --> 01:50:07.467
TOGETHER SURFACED THAT'S WILLING

01:50:07.534 --> 01:50:08.969
TO THE TABLE TO HANDLE THAT

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:10.403
SEVENTEEN INCHES OF RAIN AND

01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:11.705
ALSO HANDLE HANDLE THE DRY

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:15.508
PERIOD -- THAT SAID.

01:50:15.575 --> 01:50:17.243
OKAY I I'LL AND SINCE I DON'T

01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:18.445
HAVE MY SLIDE SO -- ALL USING

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:20.480
ENGINEERING ANALOGY FOR YOU HERE

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:23.550
AND I I I I I USE A SEVEN THIRTY

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:25.518
SEVEN MAX -- BOEING AS AS THE

01:50:25.585 --> 01:50:28.755
EXAMPLE AND I I THINK IT NEEDS

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:29.289
TO BE TAKEN THAT SERIOUSLY

01:50:29.356 --> 01:50:29.589
[inaudible]

01:50:29.656 --> 01:50:31.591
BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS A SERIES

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:33.026
OF THINGS THAT HAD TO GO WRONG

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:34.995
YOU KNOW YOU HAD TO HAVE.

01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:36.629
THE DESIGN OF THE PLANE.

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:39.199
THE ANGLE OF ATTACK SENSORS THE

01:50:39.265 --> 01:50:40.700
LACK OF GAUGES AND THE LACK OF

01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:42.002
TRAINING.

01:50:42.068 --> 01:50:44.371
AND WE HAVE TO APPROACH THIS THE

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:46.373
SAME WAY BOEING'S APPROACHING

01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:47.507
THEIR PLAY.

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:50.310
WE CAN'T FIX ONE THING AND WE

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:51.745
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:53.246
THAT WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE HAD

01:50:53.313 --> 01:50:55.248
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD PROCESSES IN

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:56.316
PLACE THAT COULD HANDLE THE

01:50:56.383 --> 01:50:59.219
WEATHER AND WE DIDN'T AND THE

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:01.221
CHALLENGE AND THE NICE THING IS

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:02.455
IN THE THOROUGHBRED DAILY NEWS

01:51:02.522 --> 01:51:03.556
BOB BAFFERT EVEN SAID.

01:51:03.623 --> 01:51:04.958
THE SAME THING YOU GOT FROM THE

01:51:05.025 --> 01:51:06.292
ENGINEERS SO I THINK THAT GIVES

01:51:06.359 --> 01:51:08.328
IT SOME WHITE THE CHALLENGES

01:51:08.395 --> 01:51:09.729
WHEN IT BEGINS TO DRY OUT.

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:11.364
AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:12.932
THOSE DECISIONS AND SAID I NEED

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:14.534
IS ONE OF MOST DIFFICULT TRACKS

01:51:14.601 --> 01:51:16.069
TO MAINTAIN YOU CAN START OUT

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:18.538
THE RACE CARD WITH IT -- FLOATED

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:19.839
AND WET.

01:51:19.906 --> 01:51:21.875
AND IF YOU HAVE A HOT DRY WIND

01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:23.510
COMING OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS.

01:51:23.576 --> 01:51:25.178
BY THE BY THE FIFTH OR SIXTH

01:51:25.245 --> 01:51:26.579
RACE YOU MAY BE THINKING ABOUT

01:51:26.646 --> 01:51:28.014
GETTING THE WATER TRUCKS OUT.

01:51:28.081 --> 01:51:30.483
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT --

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:33.787
SITUATION FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT

01:51:33.853 --> 01:51:35.655
TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:36.823
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:38.691
BRING TECHNOLOGY TO BEAR ON THIS

01:51:38.758 --> 01:51:39.826
TO HELP SUPPORT THE

01:51:39.893 --> 01:51:41.594
SUPERINTENDENT'S ON THOSE

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:43.897
DECISIONS MAKING THOSE DECISIONS

01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:45.565
AND AND AND THIS IS WHERE?

01:51:45.632 --> 01:51:49.102
OF OF WHAT -- BELINDA STRONACH

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:51.304
WAS TALKING ABOUT IS IS IS KEY

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:54.074
THIS IS THIS IS NOT A STATUS QUO.

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:55.141
INDUSTRY THIS NEEDS TO BE AN

01:51:55.208 --> 01:51:58.411
INDUSTRY THAT LOOKS FORWARD TO

01:51:58.478 --> 01:51:59.646
IT TWO NEW FUTURE.

01:51:59.712 --> 01:52:01.881
THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible]

01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:04.484
OKAY.

01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:07.320
OKAY DOUG -- BIRDS THIS ECONOMIC

01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:09.456
IMPACT HORSE RACING.

01:52:09.522 --> 01:52:10.557
RICK PICKERING AND JOHN

02:04:00.533 --> 02:04:01.634
MY NAME'S CATHY GILLIAM -- I'M

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:02.668
WITH PEOPLE FOR THE ETHICAL

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:04.270
TREATMENT OF ANIMALS OR PIZZA

02:04:04.336 --> 02:04:06.939
I'M ALSO A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT --

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.541
EVERYBODY TODAY HAS HAD A LOT OF

02:04:08.607 --> 02:04:10.476
INTERESTING COMMENTS ABOUT

02:04:10.543 --> 02:04:11.343
TWENTY FIVE HORSES WHO DIED BUT

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:12.378
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT

02:04:12.444 --> 02:04:14.313
OUT THAT EVERY YEAR DOZENS AND

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:16.382
DOZENS OF HORSES DIE ON

02:04:16.448 --> 02:04:17.983
CALIFORNIA RACETRACKS.

02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:19.618
AND WE KNOW FROM NEW CROPS IS

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:20.719
DONE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:04:20.786 --> 02:04:22.388
CALIFORNIA DAVIS THE PRE

02:04:22.454 --> 02:04:24.323
EXISTING INJURIES AT THE SIGHT

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:26.525
OF THOSE BREAKS OFTEN EXIST.

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:28.727
WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN MEDICATIONS

02:04:28.794 --> 02:04:30.496
THAT MASK INJURIES ARE GIVEN

02:04:30.563 --> 02:04:32.298
LEGALLY AND THIS CAUSES A

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:33.999
PROBLEM I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST

02:04:34.066 --> 02:04:35.801
A WEIRD ANOMALY THAT IN SIX

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:36.902
WEEKS THERE WERE NO DEATHS AT

02:04:36.969 --> 02:04:38.470
SANTA ANITA?

02:04:38.537 --> 02:04:39.605
I THINK THE RULES THAT SANTA

02:04:39.672 --> 02:04:41.307
NEED TO PUT IN PLACE ARE WORKING

02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:43.042
AND THOSE RULES INVOLVE PULLING

02:04:43.108 --> 02:04:45.010
BACK ON THOSE MEDICATIONS AND

02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:46.245
NOT MAKING SURE THE INJURED

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:47.947
HORSES ARE GOING ON THE TRACK.

02:04:48.013 --> 02:04:49.415
WE NEED TO DO MORE OF THAT

02:04:49.481 --> 02:04:51.050
THERE'S MORE THAT CAN BE DONE

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:52.451
MORE MEDICATION WITHDRAWAL
