00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:40.767
FUNDING FOR THE BUDGET DOES

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.035
PROVIDE FUNDING TO BACK FILL

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.403
LOSS -- AND I'LL SEE IF I

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.371
FUNDING AND OTHER TYPES OF

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.806
FUNDING STATE FUNDING FOR

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.274
CHARTER SCHOOLS THE REQUIREMENT

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.076
IS THAT THEY MAINTAIN AT LEAST

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.310
50%.

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:51.778
OF THEIR AVERAGE DAILY

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.546
ATTENDANCE SO THAT THEY DON'T

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:54.981
DROP SO LOW THAT YOU KNOW

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.315
THEY'RE NOT SUSTAINABLE OVER THE

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:57.283
LONG TERM.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.618
SO THAT IS THE PROVISION THAT WE

00:06:58.684 --> 00:06:59.886
HAVE IN THERE ON THE CHARTER

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.788
SCHOOL PIECE TO ENSURE THAT --

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:02.655
THIS SCHOOLS THAT WE'RE

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.190
PROVIDING MAINTAINED FUNDING FOR

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.959
ACTUALLY VIABLE AND CONTINUE ON

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:08.728
TO FUTURE YEARS.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.163
THE CHARTER SCHOOL IN.

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.597
IN PARADISE BECAUSE OF THE

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.533
DISTINCTIVE STATION.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:14.834
GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE EVEN

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:17.270
THE LOWER GOAL SO I UNDERSTAND

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:18.905
YOUR OVERALL POSITION THERE BUT

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.206
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO HELP

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.175
THAT ONE PART CHARTER SCHOOL AND

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.277
YOU CANNOT CONVINCE ME THAT THIS

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:25.878
OVERALL PLAN IS NOT.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.780
THE END OF THE DAY.

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:28.281
KIND OF A COVERT WAY OF

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:29.715
ATTACKING.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.517
CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.852
IF WE CAN DO SOME ACCOUNTABILITY

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.987
HOW ABOUT FOR K..

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:36.923
TWELVE EDUCATION.

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:37.657
WE CAN'T WE DO SOME MORE

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:38.858
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEM IN THIS

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:39.492
BUDGET ISN'T THAT A PART OF THE

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:40.660
DEAL.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:42.461
MAYBE YOUR EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:44.096
EDUCATION WE WILL CONSIDER THAT

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:46.199
AND I COULD ACCEPT THAT.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.134
BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.938
LITTLE BIT OF A NARROW FOCUS.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:54.140
THEN I WANT TO THANK YOU TOO FOR

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:55.675
THE FOR THE GOVERNOR FOR THE AND

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:57.176
THE LEGISLATURE'S FOR THE

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.778
SUPPORT FOR THE BOOK A CRITIC

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.713
BOOKCASE VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURAL

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.682
EDUCATION.

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:04.650
BUT THOSE PROVISIONS INITIAL

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:04.951
[inaudible]

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:08.521
POSITIVE.

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:10.256
IT MAKES IT PRETTY TOUGH FOR ME

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.425
TO VOTE. FOR THIS BILL.

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.327
BECAUSE OF THE OTHER.

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:17.496
ASIANS THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO ME.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.899
ARE WE REALLY BUILDING EDUCATION.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.367
I KNOW THIS IS A GREAT BOLD MOVE

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.437
TO THE FUTURE.

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:26.339
THE GOVERNOR'S BEHIND IT.

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:27.573
THERE'S MERIT TO IT.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.076
BUT SOME OF THE FRANKLY IS A

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:34.513
LITTLE HARD TO TAKE.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.548

AND US IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS

00:08:57.403 --> 00:08:59.906
PROBABLY THE NATION'S LARGEST OF

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.541
THE SECOND NATION'S LARGEST THAT --

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:06.612
JUST HAD A BALLOT MEASURE TO TRY --

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.915
TO ENHANCE THEIR THEIR FINANCES

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.082
AND HOPEFULLY GET MORE MORE

STUDENTS INTO THE CLASSROOMS --

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.122
IF THEY'RE NOT MEETING -- THIS

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:16.856
EXPECTATION ANOTHER WORD

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:18.124
SURFACING TO BE ABLE TO TOP

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.726

GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.308
SO THIS IS AN EXEMPTION THAT THE

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:36.042
LEGISLATURE IN THE

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.510

WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.250
PROPOSAL IS -- IN THOSE YEARS

THEIR PLAN FOR REDUCING THE

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.175
NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATORS SO THAT

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.009
THEY CAN ACTUALLY MEET THAT IN

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:10.910
THE FUTURE.

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:11.711
AND NOT HAVE TO COME TO

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.079

DISTRICTS AND MAYBE SMALLER BUT

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.519
HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AND

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:21.454
GIVING THEM THE SAME OPPORTUNITY

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.457

STATE REGULATIONS.

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:26.392
YES I THINK -- IN OUR

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.426

COME IN AND ASKED FOR THIS AND

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:37.036
AND WE HAD DECIDED THAT WE WOULD

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:38.771
GO AHEAD AND DO THAT BUT THAT WE

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:40.373
WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THEM -- TO

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:42.641
COME TO US WITH WITH MORE OF A

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:43.743
IT HAS.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.745
IDEA OF HOW THEY WERE GOING TO

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.313
TO COME TO COMPLAINTS IN THE

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:47.747
FUTURE.

00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:25.163

GREATLY INFLATED EXPENDITURES

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.433

BUT IT'S STILL A PUNITIVE.

00:29:57.695 --> 00:29:59.230

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:01.199

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:02.667

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:26.223
SURPLUSES WHY ARE WE PUTTING A

IN OTHER AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE

THE THE MEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE THE

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.041
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT.

RESELL WILL SPEAK TO IT AS WELL

00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:51.615
I THINK THE FIRST IS FOR THE

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:52.516
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE GOVERNOR

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:54.418
YOU ARE RIGHT THIS IS A SHARED

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:55.820
PRIORITY AND IT IS REALLY

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.822
IMPORTANT. TO EVERYONE -- WITH

00:40:57.888 --> 00:40:59.657
REGARD TO THAT FINDING -- YOU'RE

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:01.458
ALSO CORRECT THAT A HUNDRED

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:03.360
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:03.894
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:05.196
DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET -- PLUS --

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:06.430
ONE THAT'S NOT BY ITSELF GOING

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:08.065
TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM BUT WE DO

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.366
BELIEVE IT IS A MEANINGFUL

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:10.835
COMMITMENT AND DEPENDING ON THE

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.269
FISCAL SITUATION YOU KNOW WE

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:13.704
HOPE IT'S THE FIRST STEP OF A

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:14.939
BROADER COMMITMENTS -- BUT

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:16.373
BECAUSE THIS IS AN ONGOING

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.409
PROGRAM INTO YOUR POINT IN THE

00:41:18.475 --> 00:41:19.643
STORY THAT YOU TOLD THESE ARE

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.412
ISSUES THAT DON'T GO AWAY AFTER

00:41:21.478 --> 00:41:22.847
A YEAR WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:24.281
THAT OUR BROADER BUDGET CAN

00:41:24.348 --> 00:41:25.282
SUPPORT THAT.

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:27.218
WITH REGARD TO THE RATE

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:29.286
INCREASES SPECIFICALLY -- SINCE

00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:30.254
OUR NAY REVISION NOW WE DID HEAR

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:31.088
THE FEEDBACK FROM THE

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:32.623
LEGISLATURE THAT THOSE RATE

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:33.691
INCREASES DO NEED TO BE MORE

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:35.292
BROAD BASED AND WE BELIEVE THAT

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.961
THAT IS REFLECTED IN THIS

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:41.398
PROPOSAL BUT TERESA MY COLLEAGUE

00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:44.468
CAN SPEAK TO THAT IS THANK YOU.

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:45.936
THE COLOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:46.537
HAS CRACKED THE MAYOR VERSION

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:47.571
WHICH WAS A MUCH MORE TARGETED

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:48.772
APPROACH WITH HIGHER PERCENT FOR

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.140
FEWER CATEGORIES ARE IS ABOUT

00:41:50.207 --> 00:41:50.741
FIVE SERVICE CATEGORY SAID IT

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:52.309
LOOKED AT UNDER THIS BROAD BASED --

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:53.043
APPROACH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:54.645
SOME THAT IN INDICATED IF

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:55.412
THEY'RE INDICATING THE RATE

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:57.114
STUDY WOULD HAVE A ZERO OR

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:59.650
NEGATIVE PERCENTAGE ADJUSTMENT

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:01.452
FOR THE RATE STUDY -- FINDINGS

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:02.620
THAT THOSE WOULD NOT RECEIVE AN

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:04.121
INCREASE UNDER THIS SO THAT IS

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.623
CORRECT.

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:07.992
OKAY THANKS EXPLANATION NAIVE --

00:42:08.058 --> 00:42:09.793
I APPRECIATE THE THE INCREASES

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.928
THAT ARE BEING GIVEN THAT WE

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:13.964
HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO GIVE --

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:14.832
THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT I

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:15.666
THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:16.767
WANTS TO BE KNOWN FOR FOR THE

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:17.902
DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:25.342
COMMUNITIES AND FUTURE ANSWERS

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:25.643
[inaudible]

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:26.510
FOLLOWED BY.

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.950
OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES.

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:35.619
BUT THE WAY KIND OF I LOOK AT

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:36.620
THESE ARE.

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:38.555
FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO

00:42:38.622 --> 00:42:39.757
INDIVIDUALS.

00:42:39.823 --> 00:42:42.559
PEOPLE I SEE EVERY WEEK.

00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:43.727
THAT HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL

00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:44.995
DISABILITIES.

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.630
AND WHAT I SEE WHEN I SEE THESE

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:48.165
PEOPLE AS I SEE.

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.600
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WORKING IN

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:50.534
THERE.

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.803
OF SUPPORT SERVICES LEAVING

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.039
BECAUSE THEIR WAGES ARE SO LOW.

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:58.809
I SEE -- OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:00.177
THE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:03.747

SOME THE KIND OF BOTHERED ME A

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:08.185
LITTLE BIT OKAY.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.675
THERE'S NO PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO

IN THE SPACE AND INSTEAD NOW

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.864

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:34.945
DIRECTION.

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.580
THIS PROPOSAL STILL FALL SHORT

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:38.782
AND WANT TO TELL YOU HOW AND THE

00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:39.783
FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IS WERE

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:41.351
WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGING THE NEEDS

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:42.419
OF THE SYSTEM.

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:43.954
BUT WE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.589
THE RATE INCREASES TOLD TILL

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:46.823
JANUARY.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.491
ONE THAT THAT IS TO ME NOTHING

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:50.360
MORE THAN A COST SAVINGS MEASURE

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:52.262
WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE A HALF

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:53.396
YEARS PAYMENTS TO YOU GUYS.

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:55.065
WE THINK THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:56.333
THE RATE STUDY WANT TO BE VERY

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.001
CAREFUL AND AND JUST SUGGEST

00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:58.969
THAT WE NOT ALL FALL INTO THE

00:53:59.035 --> 00:53:59.502
TRAP.

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:01.071
OF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO REFER TO

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:02.439
THE RATE STUDY FOR THE CHANGES

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:04.174
THEY PROPOSE BUT THEN NOT

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.542
RECOGNIZING OTHER PIECES OF THE

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:07.510
RATE STUDY AND THUS FAR THE RATE

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:08.812

00:54:10.347 --> 00:54:11.548
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S OUT WITH

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:12.682
THOSE PUBLIC COMMENTS WITH THE

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:14.284
RESPONSE IS GOING TO BE MANY OF

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:16.419
THEM ARE METHODOLOGICAL COMMENTS

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:18.088
FLAWS IN THE RATE STUDY THE ROOM

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:19.589
POINTED OUT.

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:20.123
IN THE WE'VE ASKED TO HAVE

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.958
CHANGED AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:23.493
LIKE THE ONE FROM THE WOMAN YOU

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.795

AT A POINT WHERE WE RECEIVING

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:27.597
NOTHING.

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.065
IN THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE

00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:30.567
RATE STUDY SAYS THE SHOULDN'T

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:31.601
YET PEOPLE ARE POINTING OUT

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.336
FLAWS IN THE METHODOLOGY THAT

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:34.738
WAS USED TO ARRIVE AT THAT.

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.506
UNTIL THAT SETTLED WE THINK

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:37.974
THAT'S OF WHAT STUDY OR AT LEAST

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:40.010

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:52.822
PROPOSAL.

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:53.923
SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS STILL

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.692
FACE ALL THE RISING COST OF

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:56.593

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.827
THE FACT THAT MINIMUM WAGE IS

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:59.262
GOING TO GO UP BY OVER 80% IN

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:01.297
JANUARY ALL THE OTHER COSTS

00:55:01.364 --> 00:55:03.833

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:21.518

THERE ARE TWO POLICIES IN PLACE

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:35.065

LARGELY BASED ON THE FACT THAT

THE LAST -- COMPENSATION STUDY

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.620

TWENTY THIRTEEN AND AT THAT TIME

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:11.126
THE HOMES UNIT SIX WAS FOUND TO

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.361
BE 40%.

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.702
SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN UNITS SIX

PROVIDED IN THE PROPOSEDAGREEMENT.

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.649
AND SO CONSIDERING THAT WE THINK

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:34.817
ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE A

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.452

THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.354
WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:41.023
ASSUME THAT THEY ARE STILL

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:43.292

THAT.

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:51.600
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.469
ALTHOUGH THE STATE LAW REQUIRES

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.070
