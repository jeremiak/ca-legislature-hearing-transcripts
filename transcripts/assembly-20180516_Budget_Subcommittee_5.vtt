00:32:10.194 --> 00:32:11.696
REDUCTION POTENTIALLY WHERE.

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:13.197

AS WE MOVE TOWARDS KIND OF A

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.177

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:48.533
AS TO WHO GOES INTO STATE PRISON

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:50.101
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY HAS A RETURN

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:51.669
ON INVESTMENT BOTH FROM THAT.

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:52.837

BETWEEN VICTIMS IN YOUTH BUT

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:32.437

AFFRONT AND INVESTMENT THAT

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.947
ACTUALLY REDUCES THE FORWARD

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.982
INTO OUR JAILS AND PRISONS AND

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:19.083
AND I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.952
CALIFORNIA THAT PROBABLY HAS A

PICTURE OF IT RIGHT HERE. THIS

TO LEARN FROM. AND THEY'RE

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.695
INUNDATED WITH IT.

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:12.563
LIKE AVENAL STATE PRISON.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.532
IT'S A MODEL.

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.000
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.469
THE WARDEN MISS ROSEMARY INDO

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:21.005
MADE SURE. THAT EVERY CORNER YOU

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.940
TURN THERE WAS SOME KIND OF

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:24.875
VOLUNTEER OUR FACILITATOR OUR

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:27.144

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:36.420
DO?

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:38.122
IF I DON'T DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:40.124
DOES IT DO IT ASK QUESTIONS

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:41.292
NOT A CHILD A CHALLENGES ACTS

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:43.227

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:46.564
SO IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO GET.

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:48.733
ANOTHER STAFFING.

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:49.934
WHEN I SAY THAT.

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:52.136
BASED ON THE ABBOTT NO

00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:54.472
STATEMENT IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY.

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:56.440

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:58.976
THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TURN.

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:00.344
THEIR FACE WITH.

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:02.780
THIS IS WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:04.949
AND TREATING WIT LOVE INSTEAD OF

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:06.550
YOU KNOW MASS INCARCERATION IN A

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:08.319

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:09.987
SHELTER.

00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:12.089
I THINK THIS WOULD. WORK MUCH

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:14.225
BETTER IT WORK FOR ME.

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:16.627
INTO WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT SOME.

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:18.763
MY BEHAVIOR WAS BASED ON ME

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.598
BEING MOLESTED AS A CHILD.

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.266
IN THEY PUT THE PIECES OF THE

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:24.402
PUZZLE TOGETHER FOR ME.

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:24.902
THEY'RE NOT STARTED TO

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.971
UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY EXPLAINED

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:28.606
TO ME THE IMPORTANCE OF A

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:30.274
MISSING FATHER IN MY LIFE.

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:31.842
HOW IT ACTUALLY AFFECTED ME AS A

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.110
YOUNG ADULT?

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:35.079
DID IT MADE SENSE

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:36.947
I WOULD PRISON AT. EIGHTEEN

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:39.083
YEARSOLD I GOT OUT WHEN I WAS.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.220
FIFTY FIFTY THREE YEARS OLD.

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:44.789
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU.

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:46.991
AS ANY INFORMATION FROM.

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.492
DEPARTMENT FINANCE.

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:50.761
BELIAU.

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:50.961
OKAY.

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:52.530
.

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:54.131
ANY ANY INDIVIDUALS FROM THE

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:55.366
PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOUR

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:58.002
TESTIMONY.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:59.670
OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.539
YES MISTER STONE.

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:03.407
THANK YOU.

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:04.542
I THINK THIS IS INTERESTING BUT

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.210
I HAVE.

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:06.844
I WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT BIGGER

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:09.080
PICTURE.

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:10.314
THE AT AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:11.315
THIS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:12.983
THAT THAT WE NEED TO DO IN

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:13.818
CALIFORNIA'S LOOK AT THE OVERALL

00:39:13.884 --> 00:39:15.686
SYSTEM.

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:17.354
AND SEE WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WE

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:20.257
HAVE TO BETTER SERVE KIDS WHO

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:21.859
GET IN TROUBLE FOR WHATEVER

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:24.261
REASON I THINK YOU YOU BRING UP

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.763
A VERY GOOD POINT ABOUT. KIND OF

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:26.897
CAUSATION WHICH WE REALLY

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:28.899
HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO.

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.701
SO IF WE REDESIGN THE SYSTEM

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:31.602
SOME OF THE IDEALS WOULD BE

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:32.937
KEEPING GETS CLOSER TO HOME BUT

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:34.939
ALSO MEANS.

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:36.240
DIVERTING KIDS INTO ALTERNATIVE

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:37.575
PROGRAMS WHERE THEY CAN GET

00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.343
SERVICES.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.544
AND SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:43.314
BE CAREFUL OF THE SEVERAL THINGS.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.750
AND ONE IS.

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:46.784
THE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:39:46.851 --> 00:39:48.819
THIS FITS INTO A BROADER

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:50.488
STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING THOSE

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:51.989
ISSUES IN SOME COUNTIES ARE

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.457
DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OF. TRYING

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.259
TO DIVERT KIDS.

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:56.727
TRYING TO SOLVE THEIR ISSUES

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:58.462
THAN OTHERS AREN'T.

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:00.231
AND SO IF WE'D BRING THE FOCUS

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:02.066
WHICH I WOULD AGREE WITH BACK

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:03.934
MORE TOHAVE TREMENDOUS CAPACITY

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:05.369
IN JUVENILE HALLS ACROSS

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:06.937
CALIFORNIA. SO INSTEAD OF GOING

00:40:07.004 --> 00:40:08.239
TO THE STATE LEVEL KIDS ARE

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:09.240
CLOSER TO HOME.

00:40:09.306 --> 00:40:11.242
THAT'S A PLUS.

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:12.376
BUT IF WE CREATE.

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.311
BEDS

00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:16.347
WE TEND TO WANT TO FILL THEM.

00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:18.349
AND THAT MIGHT LEAD US TO A

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:20.151
WRONG CONCLUSION THAT A WE HAVE

00:40:20.217 --> 00:40:22.253
THE BEDS LET'S. LOCK MORE KIDS

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:23.587
UP THE NOT SO WE HAVE TO BE WARY

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:24.955
OF THAT.

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:26.257
AND I THINK FOR THOSE KIDS TO DO

00:40:26.323 --> 00:40:27.925
GET LOCKED UP I ABSOLUTELY WOULD

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:29.860
AGREE THE PROGRAMMING.

00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:32.229
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDING THAT.

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:34.331
IT A CORRECT SPACE IS HIGHLY

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.901
CRITICAL. BUT I WOULD ALSO NOT

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.536
ONE IS THEN TO LEAD TO THAT

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:40.271
DIRECTION THAT WE HAVE ALL THESE

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:41.906
GREAT FACILITIES SO WE NEED TO

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.941
LOCK THE KIDS UP TO HELP THEM.

00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:46.777
WHEN THE INITIAL. INQUIRY SHOULD

00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:47.378
BE SHOULD THIS CHILD BE LOCKED

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:48.612
UP.

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.047
SHOULD THE SHALL BE DIVERTED ARE

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.415
THERE OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH WE

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:52.583
ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.518
CREATE IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:55.786
GET THEM TO THE PROGRAM SO THAT

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:57.121
THEY'RE NOT IN A JUVENILE

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.323
SETTING. THOSE KIDS WHO DO NEED

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.791
TO GO TO JUVENILE HALL SETTING

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.726
THEN THIS KIND OF APPROACH IS

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:05.262
ABSOLUTE PROGRAM FAR PREFER. TO

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:06.831
TO WHAT WE HAVE DONE.

00:41:06.897 --> 00:41:08.065
SO WE HAVE TO BE I THINK

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.234
COGNIZANT OF. DAY INCENTIVES

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.469
THAT WERE SETTING UP AND

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:14.705
ENSURING THAT THAT COUNTIES ARE

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.240
PROVIDING.

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:19.076
A HEALTHIER WAY OF LOOKING AT

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:20.110
HOW THEY'RE DOING JUVENILE

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:22.446
JUSTICE SO IF LOS ANGELES COUNTY

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:23.981
IN AND I KNOW YOU YOU BEAR. A

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.182
MUCH GREATER BURDEN THAT A LOT

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:26.016
OF OTHER JUST BECAUSE A

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:27.017
POPULATION THAT A LOT OF OTHER

00:41:27.084 --> 00:41:28.519
COUNTIES.

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:29.320
BUT ALSO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:30.621
WE'RE NOT SENDING THE MESSAGE TO

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:32.389
OTHER COUNTIES. CREATE FANCY

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:33.524
LOOKING FACILITIES AND JUST LOCK

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:34.525
UP MUCH KIDS UP BECAUSE THAT

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:36.260
ALSO WORKS AGAINST

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:37.761
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO.

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.430
TO CREATE HERE SO THERE'S

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:40.831
THERE'S A BIT OF A BALANCE UP

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:41.966
I'M ACTUALLY VERY INTERESTED IN

00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:43.200
THIS IN INTERESTED IN IN WHAT

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:44.535
YOU'RE DOING BUT I THINK. BIGGER

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:47.304
PICTURE WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT.

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:49.473
OVERALL WHERE WE WANT TO DO REAL

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.275
JUSTICE SYSTEM TO GO HOW WE CAN

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:53.410
BETTER BENEFIT THOSE KIDS THEIR

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:55.112
FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:56.814
IN A HEALTHY WAY IF THEY ARE

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:58.182
GOING TO BE LOCKED UP.

00:41:58.249 --> 00:42:01.085
ABSOLUTELY PROGRAMMING SERVICES.

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:03.053
AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE. TO

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.188
FIXING THE ISSUES NEED TO BE

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:05.890
FIXED AND GETTING THEM BACK OUT

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:06.790
OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WOOD

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:07.458
BECAUSE THEN THEY DON'T RESEARCH

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:08.926
BUT THEY DON'T COME BACK THEY'RE

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:09.460
NOT GOING TO BE THE ADULT

00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:10.327
CRIMINALS.

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:12.296
THAT'S A HUGE WIN.

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:13.964
BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.199
PRESUME GOT A GREAT FACILITY SO

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:16.600
LET'S

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:18.269
WALK UP MORE KIDS THAT THAT'S

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:19.336
GOING TO BE A TEMPTATION THAT I

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:21.138
DO WORRY ABOUT JUST KNOWING.

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.206
BUT YOU BUT KNOWING KNOWING

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:24.074
SYSTEMS.

00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:25.542
SO THAT IT'S GOOD THAT THINK

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:26.543
THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS UNDER

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.779
CONSIDERATION AND AND SEE WHAT

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:31.215
WE CAN REALLY DO ENCOURAGE.

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:32.983
THINKING ALONG THIS LINE BUT WE

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.051
ALSO NEED TO HAPPEN I OF THE

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.419
BIGGER SYSTEM.

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:37.121
HOW THIS FITS INTO WHERE WE

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:40.057
SHOULD BE GOING AND AND HOW WE

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.759
CAN LEVERAGE WAR?

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:43.460
JOB BEST PRACTICES SO THAT OTHER

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:45.763
COUNTIES KIND OF COME.

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.965
AND IT WAS JUST.

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:50.067
JONES SAWYER. UMBRAGE SO RIGHT

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:51.769
NOW THERE'S A.

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:54.004
DIGITAL BID DEBATE GOING ON

00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:55.839
MIKE'S MIKE MEMBERS THAT IT OF

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:56.073
KIND OF.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:56.774
.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.243
THAT THIS.

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.911
BUT IDEA OF WHAT THE CLOSE

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:01.812
PRISONS OR REPURPOSED.

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:02.880
AND IT'S

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:04.682
KIND OF.

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.884
WHAT KIND OF DEBATING AT RIGHT

00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:08.719
NOW YOU NEED ENOUGH FORTUNATE

00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:09.320
FEES AND DIVERT DOING IN REAL

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:10.387
TIME?

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:12.523
I DO BELIEVE THAT ENVIRONMENT

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:14.792
MATTERS AND I AND I AND I THINK.

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:16.293
S. MAN FOR COMING HERE BECAUSE

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.895
HISTORIAS.

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:20.297
IS PROBABLY.

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:22.132
IF NOT ALL OF THE GOOD MAJORITY

00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:23.834
OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN LOCKED UP.

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:24.868
THEY TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.103
IF THEY'VE EXPERIENCE A

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:27.671
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:28.505
ARE A LIKE TO STATE A

00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:29.773
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.709
THAT DAY EXPERIENCE.

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:32.743
AND THEIR HOME LIFE THAT

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.678
ENVIRONMENT AND IN A GET.

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:36.547
THE JUVENILE FACILITY.

00:43:36.613 --> 00:43:38.215
AND IT SOME WAYS IT TRAINS YOU

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:39.416
THE MOVE ON INTO THE

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:41.452
PENITENTIARY. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:42.386
WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.221
COLLEAGUES WE DON'T WANT TO SET

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:46.323
UP. ON A SITUATION WHERE.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.859
.

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.861
ADMINISTRATION IS IT IS NOT

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:51.795
WORKING REAL HARD TO PUT

00:43:51.862 --> 00:43:53.931
THEMSELVES OUT OF BUSINESS.

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:56.433
AND IT AND INSTEAD OF TRYING TO

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.669
MAINTAIN THAT THE STATUS QUO IN

00:43:58.736 --> 00:43:59.970
TRYING TO MAINTAIN.

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:03.040
A THRIVING INDUSTRY OF PRISON

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:06.310
INDUSTRY AND AND SO I I MADE.

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:08.345
I AM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT WE

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:08.946
WOULD HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:10.247
WAY.

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:12.016
FIGURE OUT THIS BALANCE BETWEEN

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:14.251
CLOSING AND REPURPOSE.

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.519
WE HAVEN'T HAD A REAL GOOD

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:17.054
DISCUSSION ABOUT REPURPOSE.

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:18.555
AND AND SO FORTH IF WE COULD

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.424
SHOW NOT ONLY THAT REPURPOSE

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.159
SING WORKS.

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:23.694
ON A ON A FACILITY THAT USED TO

00:44:23.761 --> 00:44:26.697
BE SHAPE FROM WHITE BUT ALSO ROI.

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:27.998
YOU WOULD PROBABLY SPEND WHAT

00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:30.034
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.402
PER. JUVENILE.

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:33.137
AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID WE COULD

00:44:33.203 --> 00:44:35.706
SEND SOMEONE TO S. C. FOR REASON

00:44:35.773 --> 00:44:37.641
FOR KIDS DESI.

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:39.777
YOU CAN SEND A EIGHT KIDS UCLA A

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:40.344
FULL SCHOLARSHIP EACH YEAR.

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:43.180
.

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:44.415
RECEIVE A.

00:44:44.481 --> 00:44:47.518
SO WE'D DEFTLY PROGRAMMING BUT

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:48.052
THIS WHOLE NEW COUNT THIS

00:44:48.118 --> 00:44:49.119
CONCEPT THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:50.687
ABOUT IS THAT ENVIRONMENT.

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:52.222
MATTERS.

00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:54.358
.

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:55.759
YOUR BRITAIN TO DISCOUNT A NEW

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:58.328
US AND SO IF YOU COULD ALSO SHOW.

00:44:58.395 --> 00:44:59.763
ON A RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.565
FOR EVERY.

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:03.967
AVERAGE YOUNG PERSON THAT COMES

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:05.502
INTO THE FACILITY THAT DOESN'T.

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:06.970
END UP IN THE PRISON SYSTEM

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:10.074
THERE IS A. WE CAN QUANTIFY THAT.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.608
AND IF WEEK I WAS IN FRONT OF

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:12.476
HIM KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE FROM

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:14.011
COMING IN ORDERED THEIR STATE IS

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:15.546
A LOT SHORTER BECAUSE THEY GET

00:45:15.612 --> 00:45:17.514
ALL THE. THE NECESSARY TO HELP

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:19.283
THEY NEED.

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:21.151
I SIGNATURE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:22.753
PER YOUNG PERSON PERSON IF THEY

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.988
DON'T HAVE TO SAY STATER THREE

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:26.723
OR FOUR YEARS AND SO ON.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.026
I WHAT WOULD IT COURAGE YOU DID

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:30.461
TO TRY TO BRING THOSE NUMBERS

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:31.628
LIKE THAT

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:32.663
BECAUSE I ALSO BELIEVE THAT. IF

00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:34.765
THE FUTURE LOVE UP.

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:36.100
REHABILITATION A FUTURE OF

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.534
CORRECTIONS

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:38.769
IT'S. PUTTING THEMSELVES OUT OF

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:40.537
BUSINESS.

00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:42.473
BUT ALSO SHOWING THE TAXPAYER

00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:44.441
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT REALLY.

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:46.043
ONBOARD. WHICH REHABILITATION

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.678
THAT.

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:49.179
PEOPLE WHO USE THOSE TERMS

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:51.482
THAT WE ALL DON'T.

00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:52.483
LIKE TO USE.

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:53.250
THAT YOU CAN'T.

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:54.718
.

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.487
YOU CAN'T SAVE EVERYONE.

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:58.555
THAT'S TRUE BUT WE PROBABLY SAVE

00:45:58.622 --> 00:45:59.590
A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:00.157
PROBABLY SAVE A WHOLE LOT OF

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:00.390
MONEY.

00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:03.293
SO IF YOU.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.595
HOW TO QUANTIFY THAT I THINK IT

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:06.930
MAKES IT EASIER TO IT TO LOVE

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:09.266
INVEST?

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:11.001
USE TERMS LIKE INVESTED THIRTY

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.436
MILLION DOLLARS IN A BRAND NEW

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.338
FACILITY. DIDN'T TO SHOW THAT

00:46:14.404 --> 00:46:16.106
THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WILL BE

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:18.208
AT SOME OUT AND THREE HUNDRED

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:19.643
MILLION FROM YOU OR BILLION

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.612
DOLLARS YOU COULD SAVE. OVER TEN

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:23.380
YEARS AND THAT'S

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:24.348
THAT'S WHY WERE MADE JUST KIND

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:26.783
OF INVESTMENT.

EXAMPLE ARE ARKAN FLAGSHIP OF

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:29.112
THE NEW LA MODEL.

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:30.547
ALL OF THE METRICS EARLY ON WERE

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:32.583

THAT DESIGN OF THAT FACILITY

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:53.804
WILL DEMONSTRATE COUPLED WITH

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.038
PROGRAM IS DESIGNED WITHOUT

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:56.607
PROGRAM DOESN'T DOESN'T DO IT

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.542
EITHER. WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT

00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:59.443
THAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH TO

00:47:59.509 --> 00:48:01.678
JUVENILE DETENTION IN AMERICA.

00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:10.721
.

00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:12.155
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'RE AT A

00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:13.423
DIFFERENT PLACE AND WE WERE A

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.359
FEW YEARS AGO. THAT WE HAVE

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:16.426
REDUCED THE NUMBER OF YOUNG

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:18.795
PEOPLE AND JUVENILE HALLS AND IN

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:19.496
THE VARIOUS.

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:21.565
LOCKED UP FACILITIES THAT IS

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:23.333
VERY VERY ENCOURAGING I THINK.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.534
EVEN BEFORE YOU CAME WE LOOKED

00:48:24.601 --> 00:48:26.169
AT THAT WE LOOK BEEN LOOKING AT

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:26.870
THE NUMBERS AND SEEING THE

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:29.406
DRAMATIC DECREASE IN THE NUMBER

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:29.973
OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE'RE

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.675
LOCKING UP. AND THE KIND OF

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.543
DIVERSION OR PROGRAMS THAT EXIST

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:35.045
AS WELL AS TRYING TO PUT THEM IN

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:36.313
DIFFERENT PLACES SO THEY WILL

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.748
GET BETTER OUTCOMES THAT NO

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:38.982
QUESTION ABOUT THAT WE WANT

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:40.584
BETTER OUTCOMES. NOT JUST THE

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:41.918
FINANCIAL REASONS BUT FOR THE

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:43.754
MORE HUMAN REASON THAT PEOPLE'S

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.789
LIVES NEED TO BE ENHANCED AND

00:48:45.856 --> 00:48:47.257
THEY DIDN'T GAUGE AND ACTIVITIES

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:48.358
FOR REASONS.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:50.260
BUT WE SHOULD BELIEVE THAT WE

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:51.695

CAREFULLY.

CLEARLY WE KNOW WE HAVE TO

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.605
REPURPOSE THESE FACILITIES

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:03.106
BECAUSE JUST THE STRUCTURE OF

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:04.741
THE FACILITIES HIMSELF IS NOT IS

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:06.643

THE AMOUNT OF OUR. OF OUR HIGH

NOT HAVING A CAPABILITY WAS A

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.268
MAJOR GAP THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED.

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:21.970
IN OUR STATES ABILITY TO

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:23.605

AND THERE WOULD BE OVER THERE

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:38.620
WOULD BE THIS SELF ASSESSMENT OF

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:39.287
FUN THAT WE WOULD COLLECT THAT

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:40.522
ASSESSMENT TO BE ABLE TO

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:43.224
MAINTAIN THE PROGRAM. BUT TO GET

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:44.326

AT A CRITICAL.

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:46.861
TIME SENSITIVE ISSUE GIVEN THE

HELLISH MATERIALS FROM MODERATE

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.472

THAT THIS WAS REALLY AN URGENCY

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:05.046
SO WE WERE FRONTED TWENTY

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:06.581
MILLION DOLLARS WE PROCURED

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.284
THESE SPECIALIZED UNITS.

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:11.586
WE BEAT BUT TRAIN THE INITIAL

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.355

A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE WOOD.

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:29.371

RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.331
SUPPORT THESE.

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:39.367
THESE VEHICLES WE AT THERE'S.

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:40.869
ONCE AGAIN VERY LITTLE TIME TO

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:42.437

THIS ON A ONE YEAR BASIS THIS

01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:48.543
WOULD ENSURE THAT THE STATE

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:50.111
COULD DEPLOY THESE VEHICLES BUT

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:51.679
IT WOULD ALLOW NEXT YEAR US TO

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:52.680
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:53.915
BENEFIT OF. A LITTLE BIT MORE

FUNDING SOURCES SO WHEN WE

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.391
REVIEWED THIS PROPOSAL THE

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.426

HELICOPTERS AIR AIR ASSETS UP

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:05.046
THIS REALLY DOES REDUCE

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:07.682
CONFUSION MISCOMMUNICATION IS BY.

AND.

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:34.075
WE'VE HAD TO UPGRADE THE CODE

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.476
IN SOME OF THE THAT THE

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:37.145
TECHNICAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:38.846
THAT TECHNOLOGY ARE BUT WE ARE

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:41.315
USING IT TODAY. ALL REQUIRES.

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:43.751
SOME ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY TIM

TOOL FOR US AND WE WILL BE

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:49.957
IMPLEMENTING UP OF A STRUCTURE

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:51.693
THAT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:53.294

THERE WILL BE A LIKE UP.

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.268
.

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:01.669
A. S. SUBSCRIPTION KIND OF

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:02.870
SERVICE THAT WILL HELP OFFSET

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.939
THE COST OF THIS ARE IN THAT IN

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.474
THE FUTURE TELL THIS IS JUST A

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:08.342
REALLY IMPORTANT. SITUATIONAL

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:09.644
AWARENESS TOOL THAT WE WE

ULTIMATELY GOING TO DO WITH THAT

01:29:23.758 --> 01:29:25.359
BUT. WITH THE FIRES THAT HAPPEN

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:26.627
ACROSS STATE AND WE HAD THIS

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.162
CONVERSATION THERE'S ALL THIS

01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:29.931
CONVERSATION NOW HOPPING ABOUT

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:31.365
WHAT WE DO NOW.

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:32.633
WITHOUT A LOT OF CONVERSATION

AND THE FIRE CHIEF HAVE A

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:36.771
PROPOSAL THAT I THINK IS GOING

01:29:36.838 --> 01:29:38.372
THROUGH SUB THREE.

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:40.141

IS.

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:41.675
DESIRED IF FOR THIS ONE I THINK

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:42.743
WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO CONTINUE

01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:44.445
HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.113

WITH REMOVING THE SUNSET ON THIS

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:54.822
LANGUAGE.

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:56.590
AND WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:58.492
THAT VALUE OF PROVIDING IN SOME

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.261
CASES IT SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:01.529
TO THE ADMINISTRATION WHEN

01:35:01.595 --> 01:35:04.265
NECESSARY WHEN THESE ACTIVITIES.

01:35:04.331 --> 01:35:05.266
TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:07.301
ANTICIPATED ON HOWEVER WE DO

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:08.636
HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:09.537
SWITCHING.

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:11.639
THE LANGUAGE AS IS RECOMMENDED

01:35:11.705 --> 01:35:13.040
HER AS HIS PROPOSED FROM

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:14.708
OCCURRED TO COMMENCE.

01:35:14.775 --> 01:35:15.643
AND THE REASON WHY WERE ABOVE

01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:17.378
THE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IS

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:18.979
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:19.447
THAT.

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:21.082
THIS THAT'S REPLACE THE

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:22.550
TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS.

01:35:22.616 --> 01:35:24.652
AND THAT THESE ACTIVITIES DON'T

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:26.854
EXTEND FOR YOUR REALLY EXTENDED

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:28.322
PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE IF IT'S

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:28.856
JUST.

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:30.324
COMMENCE THEN PUT BEN THEY

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:32.193
COULD POTENTIALLY I USE THESE

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:33.727
FUNDS WHICH DON'T GO THROUGH THE

01:35:33.794 --> 01:35:35.129
TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS.

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:37.731
FOR FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG.

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:39.934
SO I THINK OUR RECOMMENDED

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.203
APPROACH IS INSTEAD TO STICK

01:35:42.269 --> 01:35:42.770
WITH THE.

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:45.172
COMMAND OR STICK WITH THE.

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:46.674
OCCUR WITHIN A HUNDRED AND

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.742
TWENTY DAY PERIOD BUT ALLOW FOR

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:50.711

NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:53.481
SO THAT WAY THEY COULD GET

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:54.515
ADDITIONAL TIME THAT THE

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:55.749
LEGISLATURE WOULD BE KEPT

01:35:55.816 --> 01:35:57.518

01:56:20.606 --> 01:56:22.175
REPORTS TO THIS BODY.

01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:24.344
THIS PILOT SEEKS TO EMULATE.

01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:26.446
THE APPROACH IN THE CURRENT CA

01:56:26.512 --> 01:56:29.615
MNC AT W.. UP PILOTS YEAH AND

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:31.351
REALIZING MORE HEAVILY ON OUR

01:56:31.417 --> 01:56:33.252
MEDICAL AND NURSING COUNTERPARTS

01:56:33.319 --> 01:56:35.321
TO HELP DELIVER THE CARE. UP THE

01:56:35.388 --> 01:56:36.889
REASON FOR THIS SHIFT IS BECAUSE

01:56:36.956 --> 01:56:39.492
IT IS MORE COST EFFICIENT AND IT

01:56:39.559 --> 01:56:42.195
LEVERAGES STAFF ALREADY ON SITE.

01:56:42.261 --> 01:56:43.463
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE MATT

01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:45.965
PROGRAM IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:46.966
OPERATED THROUGH THE

01:56:47.033 --> 01:56:47.934
IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPLETE

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.402
CARE MODEL.

01:56:49.469 --> 01:56:51.404
OP ED WHICH REQUIRES.

01:56:51.471 --> 01:56:54.006
PATIENT CARE TO BE VIEWED IN

01:56:54.073 --> 01:56:54.974
AND THE PATIENTS THEMSELVES TO

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:57.143
BE YOU VIEWED AS A WHOLE PERSON.

01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:59.545
SO IT INTEGRATES INTER

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:00.980
DISCIPLINARY DISCUSSIONS TO

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:01.214
IMPROVE.

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.849
.

01:57:02.915 --> 01:57:04.384
MORE INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT

01:57:04.450 --> 01:57:06.018
PLANS AND IMPROVE OVERALL

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:10.957
OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS.

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:14.093
OF ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.261
LENNY CHAMADO DEPARTMENT OF

01:57:15.328 --> 01:57:17.029
FINANCE OUT WE'D LIKE TO KNOW

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:18.297
THAT THIS PROPOSALS CONSISTENT

01:57:18.364 --> 01:57:20.266
WITH FEDERAL PRISON STANDARDS

01:57:20.333 --> 01:57:21.801
SCREENING EVERYONE UPON ENTRY.

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:23.503
AND ADDITIONALLY THE COSTS IN

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:24.604
THIS ARE HIGHER THAN THE PROGRAM

01:57:24.670 --> 01:57:25.705
THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO

01:57:25.772 --> 01:57:27.240
THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN

01:57:27.306 --> 01:57:28.641
BECAUSE IT IS A MUCH MORE

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:30.910
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. I WAS

01:57:30.977 --> 01:57:32.445
SCREENING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN.

01:57:32.512 --> 01:57:34.180
AND IT AIMS TO BRING THEM

01:57:34.247 --> 01:57:36.349
INTERDICT DRUGS AT ALL AVENUES

01:57:36.416 --> 01:57:37.383
AND CELLPHONE.

01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:39.585
I AM ADDITIONALLY.

01:57:39.652 --> 01:57:41.487
CDC OUR PLANS CHIU OUR WORK WITH

01:57:41.554 --> 01:57:43.723
A CONTRACTOR WANTS THEIR CHOSEN

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:45.324
TO DETERMINE WHAT DATA IS

01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:45.992
AVAILABLE.

01:57:46.058 --> 01:57:48.261
AND DISCUSS WHAT THEY MIGHT

01:57:48.327 --> 01:57:49.962
NEED TO DO AN EFFECTIVE

01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:51.898
EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM.

01:57:51.964 --> 01:57:53.166
ADDITIONALLY AYE AYES MISTY

01:57:53.232 --> 01:57:56.469
BROCK SAID CIM IN CIW CURRENTLY

01:57:56.536 --> 01:57:58.404
HAVE A MAP PROGRAM SO. THIS

01:57:58.471 --> 01:57:59.839
PROGRAM WITH A COMBINATION OF

01:57:59.906 --> 01:58:01.874
MATT AND THE INTRODUCTION CAN BE

01:58:01.941 --> 01:58:03.209
COMPARED TO THAT TO SEE HOW

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:05.378
EFFECTIVE IT IS. AND.

01:58:05.445 --> 01:58:08.214
CCR CAN USE THAT DATA OF WHERE

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:09.949
THE DRUGS ARE FOUND AND HOW MUCH

01:58:10.016 --> 01:58:13.786
SHOULD I SYSTEM EVALUATION.

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:14.821
WE HAVE THE COMES FROM.

01:58:14.887 --> 01:58:16.923
HELLO.

01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:18.524
CAITLYN O'NEILL AT THE LA AUTO

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:19.859
WE RECOGNIZE THAT CONTRABAND IN

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:21.661
PRISON IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND

01:58:21.727 --> 01:58:22.829
WE APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:58:22.895 --> 01:58:24.430
ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN A PILOT

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:25.598
APPROACH WITH AN EVALUATION

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:26.899
COMPONENT.

01:58:26.966 --> 01:58:28.167
HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND

01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:29.368
REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL FOR TWO

01:58:29.435 --> 01:58:31.070
REASONS.

01:58:31.137 --> 01:58:32.238
FIRST IT APPEARS RELATIVELY

01:58:32.305 --> 01:58:33.739
COSTLY.

01:58:33.806 --> 01:58:35.007
STATE LAW AND JUST TO ILLUSTRATE

01:58:35.074 --> 01:58:36.976
THAT WE ESTIMATE THAT STATEWIDE

01:58:37.043 --> 01:58:38.644
EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAM WOULD

01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:39.946
COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:41.614
DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND REQUIRE

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:43.049
HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL

01:58:43.115 --> 01:58:44.917
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TO OPERATE.

01:58:44.984 --> 01:58:46.986
IT'S ALSO MORE THAN TEN TIMES AS

01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:48.988
EXPENSIVE ON A PER PERSON BASIS

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:51.257
THAN THE EARLIER PILOT THAT I

01:58:51.324 --> 01:58:52.859
MISUSED ISHIMOTO REFERENCED.

01:58:52.925 --> 01:58:55.027
DOT AND NOT PILOT WAS FOUND TO

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:58.564
BE EFFECTIVE IN CERTAIN CASES.

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.299
SECOND THE PROGRAM DOESN'T

01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:02.401
APPEAR TO BE DESIGNED TO ALLOW

01:59:02.468 --> 01:59:04.437
FOR MEANINGFUL VALUATION EVEN IF

01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:05.872
RESEARCHERS ARE BROUGHT IN.

01:59:05.938 --> 01:59:07.773
WHEAT TO TO LOOK AT IT WE THINK

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:08.474
THAT.

01:59:08.541 --> 01:59:10.009
IT WOULD BE CHALLENGING FOR

01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:11.377
THEM TO COME UP WITH A

01:59:11.444 --> 01:59:15.314
MEANINGFUL EVALUATION. BASED ON

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:16.616
THIS IS BECAUSE THE OF THAT

01:59:16.682 --> 01:59:18.184
PROGRAM DOESN'T INCLUDE RANDOM

01:59:18.251 --> 01:59:19.752
DRUG TESTING OF INMATES WHICH

01:59:19.819 --> 01:59:21.354
WAS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:22.989
EARLIER EVALUATION.

01:59:23.055 --> 01:59:24.323
IT WOULD ONLY TEST WHETHER THE

01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:26.592
ENTIRE PACKAGE OF INTERVENTIONS

01:59:26.659 --> 01:59:28.327
WAS EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING IN

01:59:28.394 --> 01:59:29.595
MADE DRUG USE AND OTHER THINGS

01:59:29.662 --> 01:59:31.230
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:32.632
TRYING TO FAX SUCH AS VIOLENCE.

01:59:32.698 --> 01:59:34.033
THE.

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:35.768
THE ADMINISTRATION INDICATES

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:37.970
THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT TRACKING

01:59:38.037 --> 01:59:39.805
THE NUMBER OF DRUG FINES.

01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:41.707
MADE THE OF VARIOUS

01:59:41.774 --> 01:59:44.043
INTERVENTIONS WOULD ALLOW IT TO

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:44.977
CONCLUDE WHICH INTERVENTIONIST

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.846
FIVE MOST EFFECTIVE HOWEVER WE

01:59:46.913 --> 01:59:48.748
STILL HAVE CONCERN. CONCERNS

01:59:48.814 --> 01:59:49.549
THERE FROM EVALUATION

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:50.917
PERSPECTIVE THAT IF WHAT WE'RE

01:59:50.983 --> 01:59:52.852
TRYING TO DO IS. REDUCE INMATE

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:54.854
DRUG USE REDUCE VIOLENCE EXCITER

01:59:54.921 --> 01:59:56.289
WE SHOULD BE TRACKING THOSE

01:59:56.355 --> 01:59:58.090
METRICS NOT SIMPLY HOW MANY

01:59:58.157 --> 02:00:00.126
DRUGS WERE FINDING. FOR EXAMPLE

02:00:00.192 --> 02:00:01.227
IT COULD BE THAT.

02:00:01.294 --> 02:00:02.695
IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASE

02:00:02.762 --> 02:00:03.663
INTERDICTION EFFORTS THE

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:05.464
SMUGGLERS SIMPLY STEPPED UP

02:00:05.531 --> 02:00:07.466
THERE TRAFFICKING EFFORTS

02:00:07.533 --> 02:00:08.801
SENDING MORE DRUGS THROUGH.

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:10.636
THE ADMINISTRATION CATCHES MORE

02:00:10.703 --> 02:00:12.038
THINKING THAT IT'S EFFECTIVE BUT

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:13.539
THE SAME AMOUNT ULTIMATELY GETS

02:00:13.606 --> 02:00:15.341
THROUGH. THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE.

02:00:15.408 --> 02:00:16.876
.

02:00:16.943 --> 02:00:18.811
WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM

02:00:18.878 --> 02:00:20.913
ONLY INCLUDES ONE INSTITUTION SO

02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:22.815
WOULD BE HARD TO KNOW. WHETHER

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:23.983
OR NOT IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IF

02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:26.185
IMPLEMENTED ELSEWHERE.

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:27.920
FINALLY. WEKNOW THAT IFTHE

02:00:27.987 --> 02:00:29.422
LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN

02:00:29.488 --> 02:00:30.590
PURSUING A PILOT WE WOULD

02:00:30.656 --> 02:00:32.158
RECOMMEND THAT IT. DIRECT THE

02:00:32.224 --> 02:00:33.359
DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH THE

02:00:33.426 --> 02:00:35.328
RESEARCHER TO DIVINE TO DESIGN A

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:37.196
PILOT THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE

02:00:37.263 --> 02:00:39.198
MEANINGFUL EVALUATION AND. COME

02:00:39.265 --> 02:00:40.700
BACK POTENTIALLY IN JANUARY WITH

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:43.002
ANOTHER PROPOSAL.

02:00:43.069 --> 02:00:44.637
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:46.138
RESPOND TO THE LA DOES CONCERN

02:00:46.205 --> 02:00:48.140
IN REGARDS TO AVAILABLE DATA

02:00:48.207 --> 02:00:49.008
THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN

02:00:49.075 --> 02:00:50.209
MAINTAINED AS RELATES TO

02:00:50.276 --> 02:00:51.677
CONTRABAND INTERDICTION.

02:00:51.744 --> 02:00:53.379
WE'VE ESTABLISHED A SUREPOINT

02:00:53.446 --> 02:00:54.347
SITE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

02:00:54.413 --> 02:00:56.882
FOURTEEN THAT MAINTAINS SEVERAL

02:00:56.949 --> 02:00:58.150
AREAS OF DATA THAT WE HAVE

02:00:58.217 --> 02:01:00.052
AVAILABLE THAT IN WORKING WITH

02:01:00.119 --> 02:01:01.187
THE RESEARCHER WHO MAY BE

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:03.356
CONTRACTED. IDENTIFYING THAT

02:01:03.422 --> 02:01:05.057
DATA SOURCE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

02:01:05.124 --> 02:01:06.058
AND THEY WORK WITH THEM TO

02:01:06.125 --> 02:01:07.727
IDENTIFY ANY OTHER KEY ELEMENTS

02:01:07.793 --> 02:01:08.427
THAT THEY BELIEVE WILL BE

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:10.830
BENEFICIAL. SO THAT THIS.

02:01:10.896 --> 02:01:12.832
RESEARCH OF THIS PILOT COULD BE

02:01:12.898 --> 02:01:14.734
THOROUGH AND COMPLETE. AND SO WE

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.502
DO HAVE DATA SHAREPOINT.

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:18.638
DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:21.807
RESEARCH AT TO EVALUATE.

02:01:21.874 --> 02:01:24.877
ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE.

THATITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:35.921
WOULD NOT IT ITEM NUMBER.

02:01:35.988 --> 02:01:37.657
SEVENTEEN WHICH IS OVER TIME

02:01:37.723 --> 02:01:38.324
BASED JUST.

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:43.129
BUDGET ADJUSTMENT.

02:01:43.195 --> 02:01:45.297
OKAY WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE

02:01:45.364 --> 02:01:47.066
DEPARTMENT REQUEST SIXTEEN POINT

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:48.534
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS STARTING IN

02:01:48.601 --> 02:01:49.902
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

02:01:49.969 --> 02:01:51.737
TO ADJUST THE DEPARTMENT BASS

02:01:51.804 --> 02:01:53.339
ADVERTISE AND FINDING.

02:01:53.406 --> 02:01:55.708
THIS IS DESIGNED TO SET THAT

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.076
FUNDING LEVEL.

02:01:57.143 --> 02:01:58.811
CONSISTENT WITH SO.

02:01:58.878 --> 02:02:00.312
IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:01.747
FIFTEEN THE LAST TIME THE

02:02:01.814 --> 02:02:03.416
DEPARTMENTS OVER TIME FUNDING

02:02:03.482 --> 02:02:04.316
WAS ADJUSTED.

02:02:04.383 --> 02:02:06.519
.

02:02:06.585 --> 02:02:08.054
SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN A

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:08.988
NUMBER OF.

02:02:09.055 --> 02:02:10.790
SALARY INCREASES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:02:10.856 --> 02:02:12.658
ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EMPLOYEE

02:02:12.725 --> 02:02:13.325
COM.

02:02:13.392 --> 02:02:15.928
ANNUAL EXERCISE AND THAT

02:02:15.995 --> 02:02:17.997
EXERCISE HAS NOT HISTORICALLY

02:02:18.064 --> 02:02:19.532
ACCOUNTED FOR INCREASES.

02:02:19.598 --> 02:02:21.434
TO OVERTIME RATES WHICH

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:22.968
OBVIOUSLY ACCOMPANIED SALARY

02:02:23.035 --> 02:02:25.404
INCREASES THIS REQUEST IS JUST

02:02:25.471 --> 02:02:27.373
TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE INCREASES

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.307
THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE

02:02:28.374 --> 02:02:30.576
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN I'M WITH THE

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:32.044
UNDERSTANDING THAT GOING FORWARD.

02:02:32.111 --> 02:02:33.379
WILL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT

02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:34.513
OF FINANCE TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.148
INCREASES ALONG WITH ANY SALARY

02:02:36.215 --> 02:02:38.484
INCREASES THAT OCCUR THROUGH THE

02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:40.186
EMPLOYEE COMPACTS ARE SIZE.

ANY COMMENTS IN FINANCE.

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:36.989
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE

ONES WHO KNOW THE INMATES THE

02:11:43.829 --> 02:11:45.664
BASS AND THEN IT WILL ALLOW THEM

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:47.065
TO ENGAGE MORE WITH THE INMATES

02:11:47.132 --> 02:11:48.166

LEóN.

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:54.873
WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS

02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:56.108
PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT

02:11:56.174 --> 02:11:58.110
DIDN'T DEMONSTRATE THE NEED TO

02:12:08.987 --> 02:12:10.389
FURTHERMORE IT'S UNCLEAR Y.

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:12.591
COUNSELORS NEED MORE TIME TO

IDENTIFY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:16.528
FOR INMATES IN OTHER WORDS WHAT

02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:17.929
WHAT IS THE REASON THAT THEY'RE

02:12:17.996 --> 02:12:19.398
CURRENTLY NOT SUFFICIENTLY ABLE

02:12:19.464 --> 02:12:21.266
TO DO THIS.

02:12:21.333 --> 02:12:23.001
FURTHERMORE IT'S UNCLEAR Y.

02:12:23.068 --> 02:12:24.202
COUNSELORS NEED TO SPEND MORE

02:12:24.269 --> 02:12:25.704

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:51.142
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

02:30:51.208 --> 02:30:52.843
LEGISLATURE BELIEVES THAT THIS

02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:54.412
IS A PRIORITY WE DO RECOMMEND

02:30:54.478 --> 02:30:56.313
PROVIDING THE RESOURCES ON A

02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:57.681
THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS.

02:30:57.748 --> 02:30:58.783
AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE MAKING

02:30:58.849 --> 02:31:00.151
THIS RECOMMENDATION IS THIS

02:31:00.217 --> 02:31:03.154
RESPONSIBILITY IS NEW. FOR DOJ

02:31:03.220 --> 02:31:04.955
AND SAID THERE IS UNCERTAINTY

02:31:05.022 --> 02:31:06.757
AND THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT

02:31:06.824 --> 02:31:07.892
WOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND

02:31:07.958 --> 02:31:09.760
PROSECUTED HOW LONG THEY COULD

02:31:09.827 --> 02:31:11.629
TAKE WHAT TYPES OF RESOURCES

WOULD POTENTIALLY BE NEEDED ON

02:31:12.963 --> 02:31:14.231
AN ONGOING BASIS AND WHAT THE

02:31:14.298 --> 02:31:16.567
IMPACT WOULD BE. FOR THE STATE

02:31:16.634 --> 02:31:17.968
SO IN LINE WITH THAT WE ALSO DO

02:31:18.035 --> 02:31:19.703
RECOMMEND REQUIRING DOJ SUBMIT A

02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:34.485
IDEA OF WHAT THOSE TOTAL COSTS

02:36:34.551 --> 02:36:35.886

THINK TO OUR KNOWLEDGE.

02:42:56.266 --> 02:42:57.968
WHERE THIS WASN'T REQUESTED FOR

02:42:58.034 --> 02:42:59.469

FOR THE FIND. HOWEVER WE WOULD

02:43:06.343 --> 02:43:06.943
NOTE THAT SOME OF THE

APPROPRIATIONS ARE TO GIVE YOU

02:43:15.085 --> 02:43:16.219
AN EXAMPLE.

02:43:16.286 --> 02:43:18.755
THE REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE

02:43:18.822 --> 02:43:20.223

MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF NET

02:43:26.897 --> 02:43:28.031
BUDGET PROCESS THE

02:43:28.098 --> 02:43:29.399

HOW WE WOULD NOW.

02:43:39.509 --> 02:43:42.078
AND SO GIVEN ADEQUATE TIME AND

CONSIDERATION THE LEGISLATURE

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:44.347

SUCH AS FOR DOJ IS APPROPRIATE.

02:43:48.218 --> 02:43:49.753
