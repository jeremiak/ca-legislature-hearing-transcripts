THROUGH THEM. SO IT'S PAST THAT

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:27.686
SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:29.822
CONSIDER WHETHER IT WOULD WANT

ACCOUNTABILITY WITH STE WHAT

ACCOUNT- IF THAT'S THE SENTIMENT

00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:43.162
THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM- FROM

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:45.631
FOLKS INCLUDING US- IT DOESN'T

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:47.399
REALLY REQUIRE LEGISLATION TO

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.401
COME IN AND SET THE SYSTEM UP SO

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:53.071
THAT PERHAPS THE O. I. G. TAKES

00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:53.939
A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:56.508
CASES OR- A COMES IN AND DOES

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:57.676
SOME ADDITIONAL MONITORING JUST

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:01.246
TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT- BUT

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.582
EVERYTHING'S. FALLING OF

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:05.551
ACCORDING TO PLAN SO THAT THAT'S

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:08.153
MY QUESTION AND IT IS JUST HOW

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.321

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:15.194
QUESTION SENATOR- I'D LIKE TO

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.628
START BY SAYING THAT AS AN

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:18.564
AGENCY WE TAKE EVERY ALLEGATION

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.532

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.501
SERIOUSLY AND WE ARE COMMITTED.

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:24.670
TO ENSURING THAT ALL ALLEGATIONS

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:26.705
ARE DRESSED PROPERLY FAIRLY AND

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:28.941
THOROUGHLY. WE DO HAVE KNOWLEDGE

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.242
THAT THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:32.544
GENERAL'S ROLE IN OUR PROCESS-

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.312
AND WE WELCOME THEIR

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:35.681
CONTRIBUTIONS AND REVIEWS. WE

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:38.016
MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO COORDINATE

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.785
WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AS

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.954
THEY GO AND MONITOR OUR PROCESS

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.491
WHICH THEY CURRENTLY DO A AND

00:18:45.557 --> 00:18:47.593
WILL CONTINUE TO DO. ONE THING

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:48.894
WE DO KNOW IS THAT OUR FUNCTIONS

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.896
ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT- AS

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.130
SUCH YOU KNOW WE DO THE

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.233
INVESTIGATIONS OF THE INSPECTOR

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.435
GENERAL'S OFFICE IS THE ONE THAT

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:57.536
MONITORS THOSE. AND SO BECAUSE

00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:59.304
OF THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:01.006
APPROPRIATE FOR US AS AN AGENCY

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:02.441
TO WEIGH IN ON WEIGH IN ON THE

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:03.976
LEVEL OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:06.478
OVERSIGHT- INSTEAD AGAIN WE

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:08.947
ALWAYS WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH

00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:09.948
THEM WITH WHATEVER DECISIONS ARE

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:13.151
MADE. IF YOU'RE JUST I GUESS

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.486
JUST A FOLLOW UP COMMENT EIGHT I

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:15.587
GUESS WHAT I WAS REALLY ASKING

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.089
IS HOW MUCH MORE ARE YOU WILLING

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:19.291
TO COLLABORATE WITH THEM YOU

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.526

IF I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S-

00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:28.467
LEANING INTO THE ELOISE

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:29.768
RECOMMENDATION THAT'S THAT'S

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:30.969
FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S A COMMITTEE

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:32.838
WITH MULTIPLE FOLKS HERE IN A

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:35.440
LARGE LEGISLATURE BUT- M.

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:36.975
PROJECT IN A LITTLE BIT I THINK

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.343
FROM. MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.546
EXPERIENCE WHERE. WE RAN INTO A

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:42.614
LOT OF PAUL PROBLEMS WITH BOTH

GRIEVANCE ISSUES IN THE JAILS

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.585
AND ALSO WHISTLEBLOWER ISSUES

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:48.320
OUTSIDE OF THE JAILS IN THE

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:49.855
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE-

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.357

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:55.093
COMPLAINTS YOU KNOW BACK TO THE

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.962
SAME. ADMINISTRATION THAT THAT

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.163
SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS WERE

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.699
DIRECTED AT IT SO. I JUST WANTED

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:04.736

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:06.238
ALIGNMENT ON MY PART WITH WITH

THE A LITTLE L. L. A. O.'S

00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:09.741
POSITION I AM NOT SETTLED ON

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:11.577
WHAT EXACTLY SHOULD BE DONE YET

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:14.413
BUT- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:16.448

YOU- ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:25.290
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THERE BEEN

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:28.594
ONGOING ISSUES AT CDC ARE- AN

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.362
INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT HAS BEEN

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:32.197
FOUND TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:35.267
CRITICAL- WE'VE SEEN TIME AND

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:37.736
TIME AGAIN THAT ARE ASKING

00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:40.672
ENTITIES TO OVERSEE THEMSELVES

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:44.109
DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK- ESPECIALLY

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:44.810

INTENTIONED- BUT THIS DOESN'T

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:54.953
WORK SO WE CAN SEE THAT CDCR IS

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:55.887
MOVING IN IN THE RIGHT

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:58.890
DIRECTION- THIS IS A NEW PROCESS

00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:01.093

OVER IT- RIGHT I DO HAVE SOME

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:08.233

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:50.569
BEING RECEIVED SO WE DO IT WE DO

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:51.369
COMMEND THE DEPARTMENT FOR

00:22:51.436 --> 00:22:52.704
COMING UP WITH THE NEW PROCESS

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.639
BUT AS WITH ANY NEW PROCESS-

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:55.807
THERE IS GOING TO BE AN

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:58.210
IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. AND THERE

00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:00.545
WILL BE UPS AND DOWNS AND WE ARE

00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:03.215
HOPEFUL THAT WITH OUR MONITORING

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:05.250
WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE. TIMELY

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:06.752
FEEDBACK TO THE DEPARTMENT SO

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:07.619
THEY CAN AVOID SOME OF THE

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.988
PITFALLS THAT- WE'VE SEEN WHAT

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:11.089
THE PROCESS THAT WAS PUT IN

00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:13.258
PLACE- OVER THE LAST YEAR YEAR

00:23:13.325 --> 00:23:14.726
AND A HALF THAT TEAM'S INQUIRY

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:17.629
PROCESS- WE DID FIND SEVERAL

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:20.665
FAULT AND NOT THAT WE REPORTED

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.667
LAST YEAR. AND INCLUDING A

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:25.036
NUMBER OF- INCARCERATED PERSONS

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:26.905
GRIEVANCES REMAINING AT THE

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:28.840
LOCAL LEVEL AND SOME OF THE MOST

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:29.508
SERIOUS ONES NOT BEING

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:32.677
INVESTIGATED- BY AN OUTSIDE

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.813
OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.183
ENTITY- IN REGARDS TO ADDITIONAL

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.353
RESOURCES- OUR PROPOSAL IS

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:43.054
REQUESTING WHAT WE BELIEVE IS

00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:46.057
OPERATIONALLY FEASIBLE. WE ARE

00:23:46.124 --> 00:23:48.960
REQUESTING WHAT ARE AGENCY WHICH

00:23:49.027 --> 00:23:50.662
IS MUCH MUCH SMALLER THAN THE

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:52.664
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS-

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:53.465
HUNDRED LESS THAN A HUNDRED

00:23:53.532 --> 00:23:56.401
FORTY- PEOPLE WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:57.836
GET WHAT'S OPERATIONAL FEASIBLE

00:23:57.903 --> 00:23:59.504
FOR US AND WE BELIEVE WHAT OUR

00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:01.773
REQUEST IS ASKING FOR WILL ALLOW

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.475
US TO START THAT MONITORING

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.243
PROCESS RIGHT AWAY. AND THEN

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.845
WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND WILL

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:09.915
CONTINUE TO GROW- AND ASK FOR

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:10.949
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:13.552
NECESSARY BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:16.087
WE'VE ASKED FOR IT DOES GIVE US.

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:19.391
A WINDOW INTO THE PROCESS-

00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:21.359
OVERSIGHT NECESSARILY LOOK FOR

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.094
EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE WHAT WE DO

00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:24.696
LOOK FOR IS A WEAKNESS IN THE

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:27.065
PROCESS AND WE MAKE

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:28.600
RECOMMENDATIONS IN REGARDS TO

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:29.868
THOSE WEAKNESSES SO THE

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:31.570
DEPARTMENT CAN FIX THEIR- LAW

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:33.538
ALL THE PROCESS. WE BELIEVE WHAT

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:35.073
WE'RE ASKING FOR SUFFICIENT

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.775
TICKET TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:38.176
AND TO START THE MONITORING

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:41.546
PROCESS AS SOON AS THE- AS SOON

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:43.415
AS WE CAN GET THE APPROPRIATE

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:46.384
AMOUNT OF STAFFING TO DO THAT. I

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.887
JUST HAVE ONE SORT OF FOLLOW UP-

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:53.758
THE L. L. IS OFFICE- MADE SOME

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:56.862
SPECIFIC- OR RAISE SOME SPECIFIC

00:24:56.928 --> 00:25:00.866
IDEAS- WITH REGARDS TO THE

00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:02.834
EXPECTATION THAT WE SHOULD- THE

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:05.403
WE COULD HAVE. WHETHER WE

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.307
MONITOR MORE OF THE COMPLAINTS-

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:11.776
OR ALL THE COMPLAINTS VERSUS

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:14.613
THIRTY PERCENT- FOR THE QUALITY

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:18.116
OF THE- LOCAL IN CURRY'S OF

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:19.317
WHETHER THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THEY

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:20.552
SHOULD WE SHOULD MONITOR THE

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:23.355
REPORTS OR MONITOR THE INQUIRIES

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:24.723
THAT ARE BEING MADE. DO YOU HAVE

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:41.106
ANY THOUGHTS ON THOSE- FINANCIAL. I'M SORRY TO THE O. I. G. YES. IN REGARDS TO THE LOCAL

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:45.010
ENQUIRIES OUT. ONCE WE REVIEW

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:46.978
THE PROPOSALS PUT FORTH BY CDCR

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.246
WE REALIZED THERE WAS A LARGE

00:25:48.313 --> 00:25:49.948
NUMBER OF ENQUIRIES THAT WE'RE

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:50.849
GOING BACK TO THE LOCAL

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:53.885
DESIGNATED AND INVESTIGATORS- WE

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:56.421
HAVE GONE BACK TO THE TABLE AND-

00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:59.224
WE'VE REACHED OUT AND FINANCES-

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:01.159
WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH THEM OUR

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.094
CONCERN. THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:04.729
SUPPORTIVE AND I BELIEVE THAT WE

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:05.730
WILL BE CONTINUING THOSE

00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:07.966
CONVERSATIONS TO DETERMINE WHAT

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:11.169
RESOURCES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR US

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:13.538
TO. MONITOR THE ENQUIRIES AT THE

00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:16.608
LOCAL LEVEL. IN REGARDS TO THE

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:19.311
30% VERSUS A HUNDRED PERCENT. WE

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:21.279
BELIEVE 30% IS SUFFICIENT WE'RE

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:22.380
TALKING ABOUT IS VERY HIGH

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:25.617
VOLUME OF CASES- AND WE BELIEVE

00:26:25.684 --> 00:26:29.321
30% IS GOING TO BE- APPROPRIATE

00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:30.956
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:32.924
WHETHER OR NOT THE PROCESS IS

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:33.892
ACTUALLY. OUT WORKING AND

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:34.826
WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT IS

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:36.061
FOLLOWING THEIR NEWLY

00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:38.263
IMPLEMENTED REGULATIONS. AND DO

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.764
YOU HAVE ALREADY AN IDEA AS TO

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:42.367
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELECT THOSE

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:47.505
30% OR- ARE IN. AT THIS POINT

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:50.542
THE PROCESS THAT WE'VE. WE'VE

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:51.576
KIND OF PUT TOGETHER AND

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.945
SKETCHED OUT IS THAT WE WILL DO

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:55.647
A RANDOM SELECTION AND WE WILL

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:58.683
JUST LOOK AT THE- CASES THAT ARE

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.652
GOING TO THAT THE- ALLEGATION

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:01.953
INVESTIGATION UNIT DOES THE

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.521
COMPLEX CASES WILL ALSO LOOK AT

00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:05.490
THE CASES THAT ARE BEING SENT

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:07.759
BACK. TO THE INSTITUTIONS TO THE

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:10.495
LOCALLY DESIGNATED INVESTIGATORS

00:27:10.562 --> 00:27:11.997
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE

00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:13.732
- DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE I

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:15.200
CONSISTENTLY BY THE CENTRALIZED

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:23.041
SCREENING TEAM. OKAY EARN THANK

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:25.577
. ARE JUST TWO OF US MISS MILLER

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:28.113
IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO AGAIN TO

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:32.317
THE ISSUE THAT- OF MOST OF THE

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:34.185
ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:35.954
WILL CONTINUE TO BE HANDLED AT

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:37.789
THE PRESENT LEVEL- WHICH HAS

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:39.424
BEEN A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.093
RAISED IN THE PAST- ARE THERE

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.463
ANY ADDITIONAL STEPS- THAT YOU

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:49.367
LOOK TO TAKE TO ENSURE QUALITY

00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:51.603
AND INDEPENDENCE. THANK YOU FOR

00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:53.238
THAT QUESTION MADAM CHAIR IN

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.573
INDEED THERE IS- SOME ADDITIONAL

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.808
STEPS THAT WE'RE TAKING OF

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:59.110
COURSE AS SPOKEN ABOUT WE HAVE

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:00.578
CENTRALIZED SCREENING WHICH

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:02.680
MEANS THAT WE WILL BE HAVING

00:28:02.747 --> 00:28:04.149
EVERY SINGLE ALLEGATION GOES

00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:05.450
THROUGH THAT CENTRALIZED

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.218
SCREENING PROCESS. AND THAT

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:08.253
MEANS THAT WE WILL HAVE

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:10.488
CONSISTENCY AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:11.356
WE'RE GETTING THEM TO THE RIGHT

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:13.024
PLACE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:13.958
GOES BACK TO THE LOCAL

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:16.127
INSTITUTION THE OTHER THING THAT

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:17.962
WE'RE DOING SO BEFORE IF

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:19.330
SOMETHING WENT BACK TO THE LOCAL

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:20.999
INSTITUTION TO BE ADDRESSED. IT

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:22.133
WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN BY THE

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.768
OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS OR

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:25.603
ANYBODY ELSE IN LAST HIRING

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.439
AUTHORITY FELT LIKE IT NEEDED TO

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:28.606
GO TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:30.075
AFFAIRS. BUT BECAUSE WE

00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:31.643
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:33.244
GETTING THE STAFF COMPLAINTS

00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:35.080
ANSWERED THOROUGHLY COMPLETELY

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:37.649
WITHOUT A BIAS WE NOW WITH THIS

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:40.051
NEW PROCESS WILL REQUIRE THAT

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:42.754
ONCE THAT LOCAL PROCESSES DONE.

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.722
THAT REPORT HAS TO COME TO THE

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:46.658
OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:47.625
THE SAME MANAGERS THAT ARE

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:50.261
REVIEWING THE INVESTIGATIONS

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:53.098
THAT ARE BEING DONE BY- I AIN'T

00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:56.034
WILL ALSO BE. LOCAL WORRIES BY

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:57.569
THE INSTITUTE. THOSE MANAGERS

00:28:57.635 --> 00:28:58.970
ARE TO REVIEW FOR THE SAME

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:00.705
STANDARDS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:02.073
FOR WITH THEIR INVESTIGATORS IN

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.741
ADDITION TO THAT IF THEY SEE

00:29:03.808 --> 00:29:05.610
CONCERNS THEY CAN EITHER SEND IT

00:29:05.677 --> 00:29:07.312
BACK AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL IN

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:09.581
QUERY WORK. OR THEY MAY DECIDE

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:10.648
TO KEEP IT IN THE OFFICE OF

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:12.550
INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND PUT IT

00:29:12.617 --> 00:29:14.219
THROUGH. A MORE FORMAL FULL

00:29:14.285 --> 00:29:15.987
INVESTIGATION PROCESS IF THEY

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:16.554
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.356
APPROPRIATE. AND THEN FINALLY

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:19.724
THE THIRD THING THAT WE'VE THAT

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.292
WE'VE DONE IS WE HAVE CREATED A

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:23.761
CENTRALIZED DATABASE FOR EVERY

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:25.163
SINGLE ALLEGATION OF STAFF

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.931
MISCONDUCT. AND THAT REALLY

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:28.566
GIVES US AS A DEPARTMENT THE

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:30.502
ABILITY TO LOOK AT TRENDS

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:32.470
IDENTIFY IF THERE'S A PARTICULAR

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:34.105
STAFF MEMBER THAT HAS A LARGE

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:35.206
NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:36.808
THEM. WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.476
PARTICULAR LOCATION OR

00:29:38.543 --> 00:29:41.112
INSTITUTION THAT IS SEEMS TO BE

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:42.981
HAVING MULTIPLE ISSUES- SO WE'RE

00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:44.682
ABLE TO LOOK AT SYSTEMIC ISSUES

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:46.351
AND TRENDS AND REALLY DIVE DOWN

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:47.652
INTO THAT AS WELL SOMETHING WE

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.454
NEVER HAD BEFORE. SO WE REALLY

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:50.955
FEEL LIKE THOSE THREE THINGS

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:53.925
TOGETHER ARE GOING TO. HELP US

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:56.861
NOT ONLY WITH THE ENTIRE PROCESS

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:58.363
BUT ALSO. WE MONITOR THAT WORK

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:00.565
THAT YOU DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.167
RECOGNIZING THAT. FOR THOSE

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:04.269
LESSER AND LESS SERIOUS

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:06.237
ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:08.039
IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE FOR IT TO

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:09.474
BE ADDRESSED AT THE INSTITUTION

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:11.009
AND TO BE AND FOR THE INCREASE

00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:12.710
TO HAPPEN AT THE INSTITUTION.

00:30:12.777 --> 00:30:14.045
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:15.380
TAKE A LOOK AT IT MAKE SURE THAT

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:16.915
THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY NEED TO

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.416
DO TO REALLY GET TO THE HEART OF

NUMBER HAVE COME COMPLAINTS HAVE

INCREASED- WE'VE GOTTEN MORE-

00:42:57.341 --> 00:42:58.575
COUNTLESS IN INFORMATION OUT

00:42:58.642 --> 00:43:00.945
INTO THE INSTITUTIONS WE OVER

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:02.313
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:03.747
GOTTEN POSTERS PUT INTO EACH OF

00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:05.950
THE INSTITUTIONS AN EIGHT

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:06.483
HUNDRED NUMBER WE HAVE A

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.787
WEBSITE- SO WE'VE ACTUALLY GONE

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.689
OUT INTO THE INSTITUTIONS TO

00:43:11.755 --> 00:43:13.324
INCARCERATED PERSONS NOW THAT

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:15.726
THEIR- THEY DO HAVE A CHANNEL

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:18.762
AVAILABLE TO THEM. IF THEY ARE

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:21.665
ARE UNABLE TO OR OR WITH OR JUST

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:24.835
NEED AN EXTRA LAYER OF OVER

00:43:24.902 --> 00:43:26.470
SOMEONE TO LOOK INTO THEIR AND

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:30.040
SO WE'VE PROVIDED A NUMBER OF

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:32.676
RESOURCES TO THE GEERAL PUBLIC

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:33.677

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:36.513
POPULATION AND I BELIEVE NOW

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.883
THAT THEY HAVE- HAVE THE ACCESS

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.819
TO MAKE COMPLAINTS TO DIRECTLY

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:43.654
TO THE O. I. G. AT LEAST THIS

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:47.024
IS. PART OF THE- A REASON WHY

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:48.225
ARE COMPLETE HAVE HAVE DOUBLED

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:51.862
IN LAST FOUR YEARS. OKAY GOOD I

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:53.630
MEAN IT'S GOOD AND HOPEFULLY

00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:55.499
THAT LEADS TO THE KIND OF

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.701
CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO AVOID

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:01.038
THE COMPLAINTS IN THE FUTURE-

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:05.943
OKAY ZANZA. COLLEAGUES IN THE

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.379
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YES

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:10.748
SENATOR NEWMAN THANK YOU MEASURE

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:12.816
SO A KEY QUESTION ON- THE

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:14.685
MEDICAL INSPECTION UNIT

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:16.987
SPECIFICALLY THE CYCLE THAT THE

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:19.256
NOTE- THE NOTES. NOTE THAT IT

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.758
TAKES A PROBABLY THREE AND A

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:21.625
HALF THREE TO THREE TO HAVE

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:23.293
YEARS TO COMPLETE THE FULL CYCLE

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.131
OF MEDICAL INSPECTIONS- SO. WHY

00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:29.133
SO LONG IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:30.367
LONG TIME- AND IS IT HOW DOES

00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:33.437
THAT COMPARE TO BEST PRACTICES

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:34.438
IN OTHER STATES IF SOMEBODY

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:43.447
KNOWS. MAYBE MR CODY RATIONING.

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.482
WHO WOULD WHO WOULD LIKE TO- IS

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:48.519
BACK TO GENERAL MISSING I ALL

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:50.587
START OFF WITH THAT- THE PROCESS

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:53.323
TAKES A LONG TIME BECAUSE OF THE

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.159
VOLUME OF DATA THAT WE RECEIVE

00:44:55.225 --> 00:44:57.561
AND GOING THROUGH THE DATA TO

00:44:57.628 --> 00:45:03.067
CREATE A SAMPLE SIZE- WE HAVE WE

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:05.969
REALLY GO THROUGH THE- REVIEWS

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:07.271
THESE CASE REVIEWS THAT WE DO

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:10.007
OUR VERY THOROUGHLY. AND TIMELY

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:12.009
THERE IS REALLY NO MANDATE TO

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:14.111
COMPLETE THESE REVIEWS IN A

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:16.046
CERTAIN TIME ON THERE ISN'T A

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:18.348
SPEED REQUIREMENTS- BUT WHAT WE

00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:20.484
DO IS WE HAVE TO LOOK DO

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.986
DETAILED REVIEWS OF THE SAMPLE

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:25.389
THAT WE GET. THE DATA THAT WE

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:28.692
GET A REASONABLE SAMPLE AND THEN

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:30.627
WE HAVE CLINICIANS THAT REVIEWED

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:32.563
THE DOCUMENTATION WE HAVE WE

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:34.331
LOOK AT STANDARD OF CARE WE LOOK

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:36.934
AT DEPARTMENT POLICY WE LOOK AT

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.736
BEN ON SITE AND HOW HE CARRIES

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:41.472
BEING HANDLED ON SITE SO THERE'S

00:45:41.538 --> 00:45:43.273
A NUMBER OF STEPS AND IT TAKES

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.442
OF COURSE OF SEVERAL MONTHS TO

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:48.145
GET THROUGH AN INSPECTION THESE-

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:49.880
INDICATOR QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:52.216
TO ANSWER. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:55.152
ACCURATE- WE DO A LOT OF BACK

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:57.754
AND- ACCURACY CHECKS AS WELL

00:45:57.821 --> 00:45:58.755
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:00.190
THAT WE ARE PROVIDING DATA THAT

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:02.259
IS RELIABLE AND INFORMATION THAT

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:03.794
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:05.262
STAKEHOLDERS CAN RELY ON I'M SO

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:06.663
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY IT

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.065
TAKES A VERY LENGTHY AMOUNT OF

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:10.167
TIME. AND OF COURSE THE REPORT

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:12.769
WRITING ALSO ADDS AN EXTRA LAYER

00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:16.039
OF A NUMBER OF DAYS- CLINICIANS

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.975
AREN'T NECESSARILY REPORT

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:20.144
WRITERS AND SO IT DOES TAKE OUR

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.079
EDITORS- ALONG WITH OUR

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:23.814
CLINICIANS TO ENSURE THAT WE

00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:26.517
HAVE READABLE REPORTS THAT ARE

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.919
ACTUALLY- PROVIDING INFORMATION

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:31.722
THAT IS BENEFICIAL. THANK YOU

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:33.090
VERY SERVICES CHATHAM INTO AGAIN

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:34.358
SEEMS TO ME THREE HAVE YEARS IS

NAME'S ORLANDO SANCHEZ BUT THE

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:37.700
L. A. L. WE FIND THAT THE

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.402
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:40.970

PROGRAM AS MARRIAGE HOWEVER

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.276
BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE HAVE

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:49.578
THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:50.846
MODIFY THE PROPOSAL. YOUR FIRST

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:52.348
RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:53.849
DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF PROVIDE

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:55.184
A REVISED PROPOSAL AT THE MAY

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.320
REVISION. THAT IS ADJUSTED TO

01:05:57.386 --> 01:06:00.723
REFLECT THE UPDATED PROJECTIONS

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.358
. AS THE OVERALL LEVEL OF

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:04.527
FUNDING BEING REQUESTED CLOSELY

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:06.996
CONNECTED TO THE SIZE OF THE

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:07.863
INMATE POPULATION THE PROPOSAL

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.598
WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED

01:06:09.665 --> 01:06:11.200
FOR THE POSSIBILITY. OF THE

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:13.069
INMATE POPULATION MAY BE LOWER

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:16.105
THAN CURRENTLY PROJECTED AS WAS

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:17.807
DISCUSSED IN THE LAST HEARING.

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:19.709
OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS TO

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:20.609
THE EXTENT THE LEISLATURE

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.478
CHOOSES TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:25.781
FUNDING. FOR THE INTEGRATED

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:27.750
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAM.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.285
WE RECOMMEND THE APPROVAL OF

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:30.986
PROVISIONAL BUDGET LANGUAGE

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:33.389
REQUIRING THAT ANY BUDGET FUNDS

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.591
THAT ARE NOT SPENT REVERT BACK

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.693
TO THE GENERAL FUND. WE WANT TO

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.661
POINT OUT THERE ARE VARIOUS

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:40.396
FACTORS THAT COULD LIMIT THE

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:42.665
DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO EXPAND

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.734
THE PROGRAM. THESE LIMITATIONS

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.702
COULD RESULT IN A DEPARTMENT NOT

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.838
USING THE FULL BUDGET AMOUNT.

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:50.573
ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT IT

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:51.907
COULD TAKE LONGER TO FILL THE

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.976
REQUESTED THREE HUNDRED AND TEN

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.911
POSITIONS FOR THE PROGRAM. ALSO

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:57.613
IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.948
DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:01.484
SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE THE LEVEL

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.753
NECESSARY FOR THE EXPANSION GIVE

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:05.087
THAT THE DEPARTMENT LAST YEAR

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:07.723
NOTED SUFFICIENT CLASSROOM SPACE

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.725
AT THE PRISONS AS A CHALLENGE.

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.660
AND LASTLY WE'RE RECOMMENDING

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:13.796
THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.465
DEPARTMENT OF PROVIDE RESULTS OF

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:19.034
THE EVALUATION. FOR THE PROGRAM

01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:20.069
SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.871
DETERMINE WHETHER I S. U. T. T.

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:24.206
P. IS EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVING ITS

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:26.409
GOALS. OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:28.377
THE PROGRAM IS NOT YET CLEAR

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:29.812
INITIAL DATA SHOWS THAT

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.947
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RELATED

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:35.151
DOZENS HOSPITALIZATIONS HAVE

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.051
DECREASED SINCE THE PROGRAM

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:37.787
BEGAN. AND THE DEPARTMENT

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.054
ALREADY INTENDS TO PARTNER WITH

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.856

WITH OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE NOT

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.852
CHANGED IT'S JUST A MUCH LOWER

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.755
NUMBER. OF INDIVIDUALS AT THIS

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:03.459

GOING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

THAT IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE.

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:28.117
AND SO IN ADDITION TO OUR OWN-

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:30.953
REVIEWS THAT WE DO ON ALL GAS

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.621
AND THERE IS THAT INDEPENDENT

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:35.891
TOWER RECORDS- AGAIN THE REASON

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:39.328
WE DO GET FOR USE IS SO THAT WE

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:41.130
CAN LEARN. FROM EVERY GAS WE

BELIEVE THERE'S ALWAYS

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:45.868
OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE. THE

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:46.769

WHEN THEY GET TO THE COUNTY

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:55.303

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:16.958
THAT- THE PRACTICE SHOULD BE-

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:19.093

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:01.235
GREAT OTHERWISE- I THINK THAT

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:03.171
THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT WE

01:29:03.237 --> 01:29:08.176
EXPECT AND NEED TO BE ANSWERED-

CONNECTING PATIENTS TO SERVICES

THE PROCESS OF THE BUDGET. I

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.050
THINK WILL WORK WITH OUR HEALTH

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:50.985
CARE SERVICES AND COLLEAGUES

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:53.755

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:55.389
AND SELF PARKING FINANCING RIGHT

01:29:55.456 --> 01:30:02.764
NOW. THAT WAS COOL. THIS IS

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:03.898

THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:14.909
PUBLISHED I THINK THOUGH EVEN IF

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:16.677
THE ALEJO WOULD LIKELY CONCEDE

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.112
THAT THERE'S- SOME OF THAT

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:19.480
INFORMATION IS JUST NOT GOING TO

01:30:19.547 --> 01:30:21.382
BE AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT. AND

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:22.717
I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE AS MY

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:24.285
COLLEAGUE I BRING CODY

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:25.920

SERVICES IS ACTIVELY WORKING

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:30.124
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:31.626

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:34.996
IT SHOULD HAVE. SO UNLIKE MANY

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:36.531
OF THE PROPOSALS THAT THE

01:30:36.597 --> 01:30:38.232
ADMINISTRATION BRINGS BEFORE THE

01:30:38.299 --> 01:30:39.901

01:30:39.967 --> 01:30:41.169
LACKING SOME OF THOSE KEY

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:43.171
DETAILS AND IT'S JUST AN ISSUE

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:44.505
THAT REALLY RELATES TO THE POINT

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:46.574
IN TIME AND I JUST WANT TO

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:47.708
REITERATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:48.676
COMMITMENT TO SHARING

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:50.344
INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:52.480

PROBLEMS. REYES HAVE NOT HAD A

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:55.963
