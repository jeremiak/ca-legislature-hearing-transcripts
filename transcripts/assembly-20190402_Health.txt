SIX EIGHTY THREE A MUCH NEEDED UPDATE TO THE ASSET LIMITS THAT MUST BE MET BY SENIORS SEEKING MEADOW CAL COVERAGE AB SIX THIRTY THREE WILL ENCOURAGE SELF SUFFICIENCY FOR OLDER ADULTS. ON MEDICARE BY AMENDING THE ASSETS TEST TO REFLECT THE SHIFT AWAY FROM ACQUIRING LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS TO DEPLETE ALL OF THE RESOURCES PRIOR TO RECEIVING HIS SHIFT CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ELIMINATING THE ASSETS TEST FOR MORE. FOR MOST OF THE MEDI CAL POPULATION INCLUDING CHILDREN PARENTS AND CARE TAKER AND CARETAKER RELATIVES. AND MOST OTHER ADULTS UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE HOWEVER ONCE AN ADULT TURNS AGE SIXTY FIVE OR BECOMES MEDICARE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE. THEIR ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED. UNDER A MORE RESTRICTIVE SET OF RULES THAT REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE A MINIMAL ASSETS TO RETAIN THEIR MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY. AB SIX EIGHTY THREE WILL UPDATE THE ASSETS LIMITS QUALIFICATIONS FOR HEALTH COVERAGE BY ALLOWING SENIORS. TO ACCUMULATE MORE SAVINGS AND WEALTH WILL STILL RECEIVING MEDI CAL SERVICES MY BILL WILL ENSURE THOSE TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM MEDICAL PROGRAMS CAN MAINTAIN COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH COVERAGE. WHILE MAINTAINING RESOURCES FOR EMERGENCY EXPENSES RELATED TO THEIR GENERAL WELL BEING. FOR EVERY PERSON I'M SORRY EVERY PERSON DESERVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE FOR THEIR FUTURE. AND THEIR PEACE OF MIND KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED IN THE EVENT OF AN UNEXPECTED. COSTLY EMERGENCY PARTICULARLY OUR OLDER ADULTS WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOSING THEIR MEDICAL COVERAGE. BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER QUALIFY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SAVINGS. ADDITIONALLY THE CURRENT SYSTEM DISPROPORTIONATELY PUNISHES SENIORS OF COLOR BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CASH SAVINGS. RATHER THAN A HOME THAT IS EXEMPT FROM THE ASSETS TEST. BY ENSURING OUR OLDER POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA HAS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO LIVE HEALTHY COMFORTABLE LIVES WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE AT ACCESS TO ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. TODAY WE HAVE CHEN FLORIAN BEHALF OF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND EVELYN A CHIANG. AS WELL AND LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF SAN MATTEO TO ATTEST TO THE IMPORTANCE OF AB [inaudible] SIX EIGHTY THREE AND CLEARLY. AND CLEAR RAMSEY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THANK. A GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE TIME TO SPEAK -- MY NAME IS EVELYN I CHIANG AND I AM A STAFF ATTORNEY IN THE LEGALLY SOCIETY OF SAN MATEO COUNTY SENIOR ADVOCATES PROGRAM. AND THE HEALTH CONSUMER CENTER. IN OUR OFFICE WE ENCOUNTER NUMERIC NUMEROUS SENIORS WITH SERIOUS HEALTH CARE NEEDS WHO'S COVERAGE HENGES ON MAINTAINING A MINUSCULE AMOUNT OF ASSETS. THEREFORE I SUPPORT AB SIX EIGHTY THREE TO INCREASE THE ASSET LIMITS FOR MEDI CAL PROGRAM SERVING SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. THE CURRENT ASSET TEST UNFAIRLY PUNISHES SENIORS WITH RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS SHOULD SUCH SUCH AS THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET ELECTED TO TAKE DISBURSEMENTS. FROM THEIR INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS OR WORK RELATED PENSION PLANS. QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL SHOULD NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF SACRIFICING RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. ERICA G. NOT HER REAL NAME. WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND TWENTY TWELVE WHEN SHE WAS FIFTY EIGHT YEARS OLD. SINCE THEN SHE HAS UNDERGONE MAJOR SURGERY AND MAY OF TWENTY TWELVE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A RARE TUMOR IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SHE IS STILL GOING THROUGH EXTENSIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT. SHE HAS LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS AT THIS POINT. AT THE TIME SHE WAS THANKFUL FOR COVERAGE UNDER MATCH AYE MEDICO. AND THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE AUTOMATIC MEDI CAL COVERAGE WHEN SHE TURNED SIXTY FIVE AND REGISTERED FOR MEDICARE. HOWEVER SHE WAS SUBSIDY SUBSEQUENTLY TERMINATED UPON TURNING SIXTY FIVE SAID SHE HAD AN I. R. A.. BEING TERMINATED FOR MEDI CAL WAS A BIG SHOCK TO ERICA. IT WAS AS THOUGH SHE FELL OFF A CLIFF SINCE THIS TERMINATION CAME WITHOUT ANY WARNING -- CAMARO WITH MERELY HOPE TO HAVE A SMALL NEST EGG FOR RETIREMENT. AS SHE DOES HAVE A LOT AND NEEDED TO MAKE IT LAST. SHE NEVER THOUGHT THEY SHOULD BE PET PENALIZED FOR HAVING AN IRA. NOW ON TOP OF LIVING WITH CANCER ERICA MUST FIND A WAY TO GET BACK ON MEDI CAL ADDING AND DO STRESS. AB SIX EIGHTY THREE WILL EXPAND AND SIMPLIFY THE LIST OF ITEMS INCLUDING OUR ROADS AND OTHER WORK RELATED PENSION PLANS. TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSETS TESTS FOR THOSE MEDI CAL PROGRAM STILL SUBJECT TO THEM. ON BEHALF OF ERICA AND ALL OTHER SENIOR CENTER SITUATION. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE EQUITY AND STABILITY FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WHO HEALTHCARE COVERAGE ARE SUBJECT TO THE ASSETS TEST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AT SHARON MEMBERS CHEN FLORI ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS CALIFORNIA'S TAKEN A HARD LOOK AT HOW IT'S PUBLIC PROGRAMS ENABLE PEOPLE TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY ARE NOT. IN OUR CAO FRESH PROGRAM A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE FUNCTIONALLY ELIMINATED THE ASSETS TEST FOR PEOPLE LIVING ON OR TWO AND A PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IN MOST OF OUR MEDI CAL PROGRAM WE ELIMINATED THE ACID TEST FOR CHILDREN'S PARENTS AND ADULTS UNDER AGE. SIXTY FIVE HOWEVER FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WE STILL SUBJECT THEM TO THE OLD RULES. MANY PEOPLE ARE NOW AGING INTO THIS PART OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. ONE OF OUR PARTNERS REPORTED HELPING A WOMAN WHO LOST HER MEDI CAL WHEN SHE TURNED SIXTY FIVE BECAUSE SHE HAD AMASSED A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS TO PAY FOR HER TERMINALLY ILL HUSBANDS FUNERAL THAT SHE WAS UNWILLING TO GIVE UP. ANOTHER PARTNER REPORTS HELPING AN ELDERLY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS THE VICTIM OBTAIN A RELOCATION FEE TO FIND A NEW APARTMENT BUT BECAUSE HE WASN'T AT ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY FIND A NEW PLACE HE HAD TO SPEND DOWN THE RELOCATION MONEY IN ORDER TO KEEP IS MEDI CAL. BECAUSE THE COST OF HEALTHCARE SO HIGH AND LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE SO FEW ASSETS TO BEGIN WITH. WHEN FACED WITH THE OUT DATED MAY MEDI CAL ASSET RULES PEOPLE SIMPLY SPEND DOWN THEIR ASSETS USUALLY ON HEALTH CARE UNTIL THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL? SO IT THIS WAY ASKING FOR THREE THINGS THE FIRST IS TO INCREASE THE OVERALL CAP ON ASSET SO PEOPLE CAN SAVE MONEY FOR EMERGENCIES. THE SECOND IS TO SIMPLIFY THE EXISTING ASSETS EXCLUSIONS TO DECREASE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN EVERY MOVE EVERY NEW IN MEDI CAL EVERY YEAR. MANY PEOPLE SUBJECT TO THE ASSETS TEST HAVE TO GET CONSIDERABLE HELP IN INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS OR OBTAIN ASSESSMENTS ON LOW VALUE PROPERTIES IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR MEDI CAL. AND THEN FINALLY WERE ASKING TO ELIMINATE THE ASSETS TEST FOR THE MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAMS. THESE ARE PROGRAM OR MEDI CAL JUST PAYS FOR MEDICARE COSTS RATHER THAN AND ROLLING INDIVIDUAL MEDI CAL. SEVERAL STATES HAVE GONE THIS ROUTE AND IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT TESTING GROUND FOR A COST BENEFIT BENEFIT ANALYSIS AS TO WHETHER AN ASSET TEST CONTINUES TO MAKE SENSE AT ALL. WE CANNOT AS A STATE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTE THE VALUE OF SAVINGS WHILE PUNISHING THOSE WHO ATTEMPT TO SAVE BY TAKING AWAY THE ONLY HEALTH CARE THEY CAN AFFORD. WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

MYSTERY OF THE BILL HAS TEN AND TEN ZERO IT'S AND MOVES OUT AND WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU -- MISTER FLOORS CAN TAKE OVER WELL LIKE PRESENT THE COUPLE BILLS AND PERFECT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO HERE WE PRESENT A FILE ITEM OR TO AB. SEVEN FIFTEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB. SEVEN FIFTEEN THIS BILL WILL RAISE THE INCOME LEVEL OF THE AGED AND DISABLED MEDICARE PROGRAM TO A HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL GRADING PARITY BETWEEN SENIORS AND DISABLED MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES AND OTHER. MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA MOST MELTS CONNECTICUT ALL FIVE FOR MEDI CAL THING -- IF THEY HAVE AN INCOME BELOW A HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FEDERAL PIE POVERTY LEVEL WHICH IS JUST OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. THE ACA HOWEVER DID NOT CHANGE THE INCOME LEVEL FOR THE MEDI CAL AGED AND DISABLED PROGRAM WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO A HUNDRED AND 22%. THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THIS MEANS THAT A SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD DOT WITH WITH FREE MEDI CAL CAN LOSE IT THE DAY THEY TURN. SIXTY FIVE THE SENIOR WITHIN INCOME DOT EVEN ONE DOLLAR OVER A 122% OF THE THRESHOLD IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL WITH AN EXPENSIVE SHARE COST. THE ONLY A FOR SENIORS WITH INCOMES ABOVE A 10422% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO ACCESS MEDI CAL BENEFITS. IS BE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN A MONTHLY MEDI CAL SHARE COST OVER SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH WHICH MANY SENIOR SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY. THIS CREATES A SIGNIFICANT VERY FOR SENIORS TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. THEY ARE AS SO MANY OF THEM HAVE SHARED WITH ME FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING FOR RENT AND FOOD WHETHER MEDI CAL SHERIFF COST. ALSO FORCES MANY SENIORS TO FOREGO NEEDED MEDICAL SERVICES OFTEN RESULTING IN THE MOVING INTO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AT A HIGHER COST TO THE STATE. AND EVEN HIGHER PERSONAL COST TO THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE DIGNITY AND WILL BE. RAISING THE AGED AND DISABLED INCOME LIMIT TWO HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS MOST APPROPRIATE AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ENSURE LOW INCOME SENIORS HAVE ECHO ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. AB SEVEN FIFTEEN WOULD ENSURE THAT VULNERABLE. RELATIONS LOW INCOME. SENIORS ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HAIR -- HEALTHCARE EXCUSE ME. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THEN THE WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER FOR LAW AND POVERTY AND TRICIA VINSON FROM THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF SAN MATTEO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ALLOWED TO WITNESSES THREE MINUTES EACH THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS TRISH VINCENT AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH CONSUMER CENTER OF THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF SAN MATEO COUNTY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF AB. SEVEN FIFTEEN FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS I'VE REPRESENTED LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND COUNTING ENCOUNTERING BARRIERS TO THE HEALTH CARE. THIS PAST YEAR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN SENIORS SOUGHT OUR HELP BECAUSE OF AN UNAFFORDABLE MEDI CAL SURE OF COST THAT REPRESENTS OVER ONE THIRD OF OUR HEALTH CASES. WE ROUTINELY SEE SENIORS WHO DO WITHOUT TREATMENT AND MEDICATION THAT THEIR DOCTORS HAVE PRESCRIBED IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THEIR HOUSING AND FOOD. BY FAILING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH IS NEEDED THEIR MEDICAL CONDITIONS OFTEN DETERIORATE. RESULTING IN OF AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL CARE. THIS PAST WEEK ALONE SIX CLIENTS CAME TO OUR OFFICE AS A RESULT OF A NOTICE OF ACTION THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR FREE MEDI CAL. AND WOULD HAVE A SHARE OF THE COST. THE REASON FOR THIS DETRIMENTAL CHANGE WAS THAT THEY RECEIVED A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THAT HAD THROWN THEM JUST OVER THE LEVEL FOR FREE CARE. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I SPOKE. TO NOR A. B. WHICH IS NOT HER REAL NAME IS EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. SHE'S DIABETIC AND HAS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. SHE HAS THREE STANCE AND NEEDS TO VISIT HER CARDIOLOGISTS EVERY THREE MONTHS. SHE NEEDS REGULAR BLOOD TESTS TO MONITOR HER DIABETES AND SHE TAKES SEVEN MEDICATIONS EACH DAY. IN JANUARY SHE RECEIVED A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO OUR SOCIAL SECURITY BRINGING HER ONE DOLLAR AND NINETY TWO CENTS OVER THE LEVEL FOR FREE CARE. AS A RESULT SHE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF ACTION THAT SHE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE THE FREE CARE BUT WOULD HAVE A SHARE OF COST OF SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE DOLLARS A MONTH. NORA WAS PANICKED SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD HER MEDICATION OR CONTINUE TO RECEIVE LIFESAVING TREATMENT FROM HER CARDIOLOGISTS TENER HEALTH CARE TEAM. SHE KNOWS THE DISTRESS IS ONLY EXACERBATING HER ALREADY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. BUT EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE SHE FEELS HOPELESS TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE. IT'S BOTH IRONIC AND UNFAIR THAT NORTH HEALTHCARE COSTS BECAME UNAFFORDABLE BY VIRTUE OF HER BEING OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. A PROGRAM THAT WAS INTENDED TO HELP VULNERABLE SENIORS RECEIVE THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. WE ASK YOU TO REMEDY THIS INJUSTICE AND AN OCTAVE SEVEN FIFTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PROUD CO SPONSORS OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE IT'S UNFAIR THAT SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY ARE SUBJECT TO A LOWER INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD. OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS LESS A MONTH. IN SAID THESE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE OR DISABILITY STATUS IF THEY HAVE INCOMES ABOVE. TWELVE HUNDRED FORTY TWO A MONTH ARE ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW WITH THE SHERIFF COSTS THIS MEANS THEY ARE EXPECTED TO LIVE OFF OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE. THIS MAY HAVE MADE SENSE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WHEN THAT THE DOOR SHOWED WAS SET BUT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE NOW. MANY OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE DIFFICULTY LIVING OFF OF THEIR CURRENT INCOME OF ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED A MONTH MUCH LESS HALF OF THIS AMOUNT. THIS FORCES THEM TO MAKE DIFFICULT HEALTH DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL DECISIONS INCLUDING RATIONING THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS US FOR EXAMPLE THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINE INSTEAD OF TAKING DALY MAYBE TAKING ONCE A WEEK. OR DELAYING A DOCTOR'S VISIT OR FOR GOING CARE COMPLETELY. NOW IS THE TIME TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED PARITY AND RELIEF TO OUR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND URGE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR THIS BIPARTISAN BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. AND REBEKAH COUSINS I'M A VOLUNTEER FOR OUR AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB SEVEN FIFTY IN.

BILL IS ABLE TO TELL. RIGHT DOCTOR WOULD LOOK LIKE A FILE ITEM THREE AB. TEN FORTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] AND MEMBERS. ONE THING MANY OF US WOULD AGREE ON IS SENIOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN TO FROM A LONG. TERM CARE FACILITY TO A HOME OR APARTMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITY WHEN THEY ARE ABLE. RIGHT NOW WHAT'S THE SENIORS DISCHARGE FROM A NURSING HOME THEY OFTEN HAVE NO WHERE TO RETURN TO BECAUSE AB THEIR LOST THEIR HOME OR CAN'T FIND A PLACE TO STAY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD. FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT. AND THE UP FRONT COST REQUIRED TO MOVE TO AN APARTMENT. AB TEN FORTY TWO DOES TWO THINGS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FIRST IT WOULD INCREASE WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCE. THIS ALLOWS US CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED AND NINE DOLLARS A MONTH AND IT HAS IT'S BEEN THAT A MONTH MATT AMOUNT FOR DECADES -- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT AMOUNT IS WOEFULLY IN ADEQUATE TO MAINTAIN A HOME IN CALIFORNIA. SECOND IT WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW TRANSITIONAL NEEDS FUNDS FOR PICK PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEAVE A NURSING HOME BUT CAN'T MOVE OUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO GO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I DO HAVE WITNESSES HERE FOR IN SUPPORT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M JIMMY FROM IN FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. I THE COMMITTEE STAFF GNOSIS DOESN'T EXCELLENT JOB LAYING OUT THE IMPORTANT NEED FOR THIS BILL IN THE KEY PIECES THAT WOULD ASSIST MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS WHO BOTH WANT TO AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEAVE NURSING HOMES BUT FACE THE BEARER OF NOT HAVING THE RESOURCES TO EITHER MAINTAIN A HOME. OR SAFE TO FIND ONE I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE A GOOD COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THIS BARRIER KEEPS THOSE RECIPIENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES AND IN THEIR OWN HOMES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AT GREATER EXPENSE JUST TO THE STATE. ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FORTY TWO WILL ALLOW NURSING HOME RESIDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO LEAVE NURSING FACILITIES TO USE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO KEEP THEIR HOME USING THE HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCE. THE HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCE ALLOWS A RESIDENT OF A NURSING HOME WHO MEETS A SPECIFIC CRITERIA THE ABILITY TO SPEND MONEY ON THEIR HOME. THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE USED FOR SHARE COST. IMAGINE THE RESIDENT WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO LIVE AT HOME BUT CAN'T BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR HOUSE WHILE THEY WERE UNABLE TO PAY FOR THE RENT TAXES MAINTENANCE ETCETERA. IF THE HOME UP KEEP ALLOWANCE WAS AN AMOUNT ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO KEEP THEIR HOUSE THEY WOULD BE OUT OF THE NURSING FACILITY AND THE STATE WOULD NOT BE PAYING FOR THE HIGH COST. OF THAT FACILITY AB TEN FORTY TWO WILL ALLOW NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR HOMES. TO SAVE MONEY AND TRANSITIONAL NEEDS FUND FOR SIX MONTHS. THE CONCEPT IS REALLY SIMPLE. WHAT NURSING HOME RESIDENTS SAVE SOME MONEY FOR A SIX MONTH PERIOD TO GET BACK INTO THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES? AND OUT OF A NURSING HOME WHEN THE DOCTOR CERTIFIES THAT THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE THERE -- THE CURRENT HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCES TWO HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS IS AN UNCHANGED AS THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. IF THAT MOUNT HAD BEEN PEGGED TO INFLATION IT WOULD BE NINE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS. BUT INSTEAD IT HAS A CURRENT BUYING POWER OF LESS THAN. FORTY FIVE CONSIDERING THAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THESE PROVISIONS WAS TO HELP MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS RETURN TO THEIR HOMES IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE FORTY FIVE DOLLARS BE A SUFFICIENT SPRINGBOARD TO DO SO. THE TIME HAS COME TO MOVE TOWARDS MAKING THE HOME UPKEEP ALLOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL. BUT IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN REALIZED -- DISABILITY RIGHTS STRONGLY URGES AND I'VE A GOOD AFTERNOON -- I'M CHEN FLORIDA WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A HEALTH CRISIS LANDING SOMEONE IN A NURSING HOME CAN COMPLETELY WIPE OUT SOMEONE'S FINANCES. THE MEDICARE PROGRAM ALSO REQUIRES PEOPLE TO PAY MOST OF THEIR INCOME WHILE THEY'RE RECEIVING NURSING HOME SERVICES. AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS OUR LOCAL LEGAL SERVICES PARTNERS HAVE ASSISTED MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BEING RELEASED FROM NURSING HOMES WITH LITERALLY NO WHERE TO GO. OUR PARTNERS REPORT PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR NURSING HOME AND WERE RELEASED TO A MOTEL. A SHELTER OR THE STREET. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE TOOK IMPORTANT STEPS TO IMPROVE HOSPITAL DISCHARGE POLICIES FOR PEOPLE WITH NOWHERE TO GO. AND MANY ADVOCATES TOLD ME THAT WE NEEDED THE SAME PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE LEAVING NURSING HOME CARE. WELL THE LARGER PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AB TEN FORTY TWO WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS AMONG SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE AMOUNT THAT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES COULD SAVE TO PROTECT THEIR EXISTING HOMES. AB TEN FORTY TWO WOULD ALSO MAKE AN IMPORTANT PROOF MAN ON THE HOME UP KEEP ALLOW ITS PROGRAM TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRANSITIONAL NEEDS FUND. WHEN I ASKED OUR LOCAL LEGAL SERVICES ADVOCATES IF THEY WERE ABLE TO USE THE HOME ABOUT KEEP ALLOWANCE PROGRAM TO HELP PEOPLE LIVING NURSING HOMES EVERY PRETTY HAVE REPEATED PROBLEM I HEARD WAS? THAT THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES SOMEONE TO HAVE A HOME. TOO OFTEN THE PEOPLE WE WANT TO HELP HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR HOME EITHER BEFORE ENTERING THE NURSING ARE OR AS A CONSEQUENCE THEM IN THERE. AB TEN FORTY TWO WILL NOT GET US ALL THE WAY THERE AND ENSURING THAT EVERYONE LEAVING A NURSING HOME AS A HOME TO RETURN. TO BUT IT DOES TAKE A VERY IMPORTANT STEP. BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DIVERT SOME OF THEIR INCOME FROM THE COST OF THEIR HEALTH CARE TO SAVING FOR AN APARTMENT MORE PEOPLE HAVE A HOME TO GO TO WHEN THEY LEAVE.

MILOSEVIC WILL BE PLACED ON CALL. BY DOCTOR WOULD AB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL PREVENT LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE THE BELT IN BOTH. MEDICARE AND MEDICARE ALL LOSING THEIR MEDICARE COVERAGE WHEN THE STATE BEGINS PAYING THEIR MEDICARE PART B. PREMIUMS. THIS ISSUE IS COMPLICATED BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED. RIGHT NOW WHEN CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE APPLY FOR MEDI CAL THEY CAN DEDUCT. THE AMOUNT THEY SPEND ON THEIR MEDICARE PART B. PREMIUM FROM THEIR MONTHLY INCOME IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THAT AMOUNT IS AROUND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. AND TWICE THAT FOR A COUPLE. IF THERE EXISTS TO EX. IF THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. THE STATE BEGINS PAYING FOR THE PART B. PREMIUM. FOR A SMALL PEOPLE A GROUP OF PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE MEDI CAL INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD. THIS CAN PUSH THEIR INCOME UP ABOVE THE LEVEL SO THEY ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. THIS MEANS THEY LOSE THE COVERAGE THEY JUST SIGNED UP. FOR PEOPLE REFER TO THIS AS FLIPPING OR YO YO ING. BUT IN ACTUALITY IT'S QUITE SERIOUS. WITH A LOW INCOME INDIVIDUAL OR COUPLE LOSES ARE MEDI CAL THREE THINGS HAPPEN FIRST IT MEANS THEY NOW HAVE TO PAY MEDICARE PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES. SECOND THEY LOSE THE ADDITIONAL LONG TERM SEPARATE SERVICES MEDI CAL PROVIDES THAT MEDICARE DOES NOT UNLESS THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY OVER HALF OF THEIR INCOME. ON HEALTH CARE COSTS AND THIRD IT MEANS THEY LOSE THEIR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE. PLAN. AB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT MAKE SURE THIS WON'T HAPPEN BY BASICALLY HOPE HOLDING PEOPLE IN THE SAME PLACE THEY WERE WHEN THEY APPLIED SO DON'T BOUNCE OFF OF MEDICAL COVERAGE. I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT NOTED IN COMMENT SEVEN IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN I ABOUT. THE DOCTOR WOULD FIRST WITH THIS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT AB. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT MY NAME IS KIM SAW FUN AND I'M AN ADVOCATE AT THAT SAID IT LEGAL SERVICES IN LOS ANGELES. I ASSIST LOW INCOME DISABLED AND OLDER ADULTS ACCESS MEDI CAL BENEFITS. AB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL SIMPLIFY MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY AND CORRECTED MEDI CAL GLITCH CALLED THE MEDI CAL YO YO. INDIVIDUALS YO YO BETWEEN FREE MEDI CAL AND SHARE OF COSTS MEDI CAL EVERY FEW MONTHS LET ME EXPLAIN HOW THE YO YO WORKS AND HOW AB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL CORRECT THIS GLITCH. MEET MY CLIENT EDDIE. EDDIE IS DISABLED AND HE LIVES IN LOS ANGELES. HIS SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME IS THIRTEEN ELEVEN A MONTH AND HE HAS NO OTHER INCOME. HE PAYS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH FOR HIS MEDICARE BE PREMIUM. THIS PREMIUM IS DEDUCTED FROM HIS SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. AFTER DEDUCTIONS. EDDIE'SCANNIBAL INCOMES. ELEVEN SEVENTY THAT'S THE INCOME LIMIT THE INCOME LIMIT FOR FREE MEDI CAL IS. TWELVE SEVENTY ONE TO HIS INCOMES BELOW THE INCOME LIMIT AND HE'S APPROVED FOR FREE MEDICARE. AS AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT TO HIM THE STATE PAYS HIS MEDICARE BE PREMIUM. AT IS THRILLED HE NO LONGER NEEDS TO PAY HIS MEDICARE BE PREMIUM. UNFORTUNATELY EDDIE WILL NOT BE THRILLED FOR LONG. HERE'S THE GLITCH. WHEN HE STOPS PAYING HIS MEDICARE BE PREMIUM? HIS COUNTABLE INCOME INCREASES TO THIRTEEN ELEVEN WHICH IS OVER THE FREE MEDI CAL INCOME LIMIT OF TWELVE SEVENTY ONE HE IS NOW IN ELIGIBLE FOR THE FREE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. MEDI CAL TELLS HIM HE MUST PAY A MONTHLY SHERIFF COST OF SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE DOLLARS. THIS IS LIKE A MONTHLY DEDUCTIBLE HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE DOLLARS OF MEDICAL EXPENSES EACH MONTH. IN ANY CASE HE MUST PAY HIS AYE HSS HOME CARE PROVIDER THE SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE DOLLAR SHARE OF COST. WHICH IS ALMOST HALF OF HIS INCOME. SINCE EDDIE LOST ELIGIBILITY FOR FREE MEDICO MEDICO STOPS PAYING HIS MEDICARE BE PREMIUM. SOCIAL SECURITY WILL THEN START CHARGING HIM A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH FOR MEDICARE BE WHICH AGAIN LOWERS HIS INCOME TO UNDER. ELEVEN SEVENTY AND HE NAY CAN NOW GET FREE MEDICARE. EVEN THOUGH HIS ACTUAL INCOME NEVER CHANGES HE WILL YO YO BETWEEN FREE MEDICO AND SHARE OF THE COST MEDI CAL. EVERY FEW MONTHS. OKAY. THE YOUR YOUR RULES ARE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSING AND COMPLEX. I REGULARLY COUNSEL PEOPLE STUCK IN THE YO YO. THOUSANDS OF OLDER AND DISABLED ADULTS ARE CAUGHT IN THIS MEDI CAL GLITCH STATEWIDE. AB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT CREATES A NEW LAW TO STOP THE MEDICAL YO YO. APPLICANTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE MEDI CAL WHEN THEY ENROLL WILL STAY ELIGIBLE ONCE THE STATE START PAYING THEIR MEDICARE BE PREMIUM. THAT SAID I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE I EIGHT II ON TEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND CUT THE STRING OF THE AREA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MEMBER CHAIR. I'M CLEAR RAMSEY WITH JUSTICE IN AGING AND I WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF NOT PASSING THIS BILL VERSUS THE IMPACTS OF PASSING THIS BILL. AND FIRST I WANT TO START WITH A COUPLE QUOTES FROM CLIENTS FIRST WE HAD ONE CLIENT ASK. THIS CAN'T BE HOW THIS WORKS RIGHT AND UNFORTUNATELY AS ATTORNEYS WE HAVE TO TELL THEM ACTUALLY THIS IS RIGHT IT'S JUST COMPLETELY NONSENSICAL. WE HAVE MISS RAY IS NOT HER REAL NAME WHO IS ABLE TO SHARE HER THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW THIS YO YO HAS AFFECTED HER. SHE'S A SPANISH SPEAKING WOMAN SEVENTY THREE AND LIVES IN OAKLAND. THIS IS HER DAUGHTER TRANSLATING HER COMMENTS. I CAN'T RELAX AND LOSE SLEEP BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO BE COVERED. I GET WORRIED BECAUSE IT'S THE MONEY I LIVE OFF OFIT EVEN THOUGH MY SOCIAL SECURITY MIGHT GO UP A LITTLE BIT MY BILLS KEEP GOING UP TO AND THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THAT. IT'S EXTRA FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT'S HARDER FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THE RULES AND COMMUNICATE WITH MEDI CAL ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE PROOF THEY NEED. I HAVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS DIABETES AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND I KNOW THE STRESS AFFECTS MY HEALTH. AND ALL THE STRESS ON THIS OLDER ADULT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF A COMPLICATED MEDI CAL RULE. SO WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF NOT PASSING THIS BILL WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING CURRENTLY WELL PEOPLE GET HIT WITH ON ON AFFORDABLE SHERIFF COST. THERE'S DISRUPTION TO THEIR HEALTHCARE BOTH THEIR ONGOING CARE AND THEIR LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. PEOPLE WILL LOSE COVERAGE WITHIN THEIR MANAGED CARE PLAN FOR MEDI CAL SO PEOPLE WILL BE DROPPED OFF FOR THOSE MANAGED CARE PLANS. BLESS YOU. PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO START PAYING THEIR PART B. PREMIUM AND THOSE OFTEN COME OUT TWO TO THREE MONTHS AT A TIME AND AN UNEXPECTED MOMENT SO ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEONE WILL SEE THEIR DEPOSIT. AND IT WILL BE SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS LESS FOR THAT MONTH OFTEN RISKING THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR THEIR HOUSING AND OTHER HEALTH CARE COST. AND IT WILL CAUSE PEOPLE TO RATION CARE AND THAT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BOUNCE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN FREE AND SHERIFF COST MEDI CAL. HOWEVER THE EFFECTS OF PASSING THIS BILL WILL BE TO ALLOW LOW INCOME SENIORS TO KEEP THEIR FREE MEDI CAL. TO INCREASE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND TO INCREASE THEIR FINANCIAL STABILITY BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE STRUGGLING BETWEEN PAYING AND NOT PAYING THEIR MEDICARE PART B. COST. JUST AS AN AGING AND ALL THE CO SPONSORS ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AT THE VOTE COUNT ON JUST AS A CORRECTION HERE THE VOTE COUNT ON EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY THREE WAS NINE ZERO NOT TEN ZERO WAS ANNOUNCED BUT WE'LL LEAVE THAT -- OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON TO SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO OUR REGULAR ORDER OF BUSINESS -- THAT WOULD BE MOVING TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB FIVE OH SIX MISTER KALRA THANK YOU MISS SURE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE OH SIX UPDATES LONG TERM CARE FACILITY CITATION COUNTIES IN ADVANCE. FOR NOW THERE'S FOR NEGLIGENT CARE. TO SAFEGUARD NURSING HOME AND LONG TERM CARE FACILITY RESIDENTS. I WANT TO FIRST ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS AND ABOVE AND APPRECIATE THE THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO WORKING WITH YOU TO ADDRESS. ALL BUT ONE OF THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. AS AMENDED THE BILL EFFECTUALLY ITS RECENT STATE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS TO INCREASE LONG TERM CARE FACILITY CITATION AMOUNTS WHICH HAVE NOT CHANGED IN EIGHT YEARS FOR CLASS BE CITATION. AND NINETEEN YEARS FOR CLASS A. AND DOUBLE A. CITATIONS. IN THE AUTO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT STATE CITATION COUNTY SHOULD BE INCREASED ANNUALLY BY AT A MINIMUM THE COST INFLATION. MM INTRODUCED TO INCREASE TO CLOSE REFLECT THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AS REQUESTED BY THE OPPOSITION. I'M AGREEING TO MAKE THIS INCREASE A ONE TIME -- INCREASE BUT GRANT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE AUTHORITY TO INDEX AMOUNTS BASED ON THE CPI. ALSO AGREED TO MAKING THE INCREASES THAT TO CITATION PERSPECTIVE TO AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY AND DELETING LANGUAGE ALLOWING A SEPARATE CITATION FOR A VIOLATION OF PATIENTS RIGHTS. AGAIN THESE A MEN'S ROOM FOR A PROPOSED A BY THE OPPOSITION AND ACCEPTED BY MYSELF AS WELL AS AND CERTAINLY THE AB THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF. LASTLY AS SUGGESTED BY THE OPPOSITION THE COMEDIAN MEN'S CREATE. A CREATES A HIGHER PENALTY FOR AN A CITATION THAT WAS REDUCED TO FROM A DOUBLE A WHICH RESULTED IN A RESIDENCE STAFF THAT IS HALF THE AMOUNT OF A CLASS OF DOUBLY CITATION. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT. TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX EE CITATIONS WERE ISSUED AND CLOSE BETWEEN THOSE 77% WERE REDUCE OR SIR A PRETTY HIGH RATE. WHERE RECRUIT CURRENTLY DIFFER -- WHERE I CURRENTLY DIFFER WITH THE OPPOSITION IS OVER DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE VERSES SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR WHEN A PLAN CLASS DOUBLY VIOLATION INVOLVING THE DEATH OF A RESIDENT? OVER TIME COURTS AND LEGAL EXPERTS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE IS CONFUSING. AND SHOULD BE ELIMINATED AS THE STANDARD FOR CAUSATION FOR JURY INSTRUCTION. CALIFORNIA HAS SINCE ADOPTED A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR DEFINITION IS IN ITS JURY INSTRUCTIONS FOR CAUSATION. HOWEVER THE USE OF DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE CONTINUES. THIS IS A HINDER THE ABILITY THE DEPARTMENT TO ASSIGN CLASS DOUBLY BY LESIONS BECAUSE THE PHRASE DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE UNCLEAR AND RELAX RELIABLE LEGAL PRECEDENT. THE CHANGES PROPOSED UNDER AB FIVE OR SIX IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF RESIDENTS. AND HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE THOSE FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESIDENTS HARM OR DEATH. WOULD BE TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY AS MARIA ABLE GARCIA WHO LOST HER MOTHER DUE TO NEGLIGENCE AND NURSING HOME CARE. AND JIMMY FROM AGAIN FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. PLEASE GOING TO SERVICE GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS MONEY I HAVE A GARCIA. I STAND HERE TODAY NOT ONLY TO TALK ABOUT AN AMAZING MEXICAN WOMAN. ME MAMA. YEAH THE GUYS HERE. BUT TO BE HER VOICE AND THE VOICE FOR THOUSANDS OF DISABLED RESIDENTS AND HUNDREDS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES DUE TO LACK OF PROPER CARE. MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN MEXICO ON APRIL TWENTY SIX NINETEEN THIRTY SIX AND DIED ON SEPTEMBER FOURTH. TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHE REPEATED TO ME MANY TIMES NOT MAKE IT A MOVIE. I DON'T WANT TO DIE. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN MY BUDGET MY MOTHER SUFFERED A MASSIVE STROKE THAT LEFT HER. WITH BRAIN DAMAGE A WEEK LATER THE DOCTOR CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME. YOUR MOTHER WOULD NOT RECOVER MUCH MOVEMENT OF THE LEFT SIDE OF HER BODY. TERRIFIED. MY RESPONSE WAS YOU MEAN SHE ONE BE PARALYZED FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. YES DR RESPONDED. MY MOTHER WAS A STRONG INDEPENDENT WOMAN WHO ALWAYS HAD COFFEE READY WHICH SUGAR ADDED. YOU COULD NOT SAY NO TO HER. SCARED AND CONFUSED AFTER HER MASSIVE STROKE SHE HAS SHE WAS EXTREMELY DEVASTATED. WORRIED SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO BE THERE FOR HER CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. SHE BECAME VERY DETERMINED TO OVERCOME SHE REPEATED TO ME MANY TIMES. NO MAKE YET ON WHAT HE IS I DO NOT WANT TO DIE. IN MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AFTER LONG THOUGHT WE HER NINE CHILDREN. DECIDED TO ADMIT HER TO WHAT WOULD SPRINGS HEALTH CARE FACILITY. A LONG TERM HEALTH CARE FACILITY IN BY SALLY A WITH HOPES OF A RECOVERY IN BRINGING HER HOME. AFTER ADMITTING HER THE CERTIFIED STAFF TOLD HER SHE WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT AND SHE WOULD RECOVER FROM THIS. AND GO ON TO LIVE MANY MORE YEARS. WEEKS PASSED AND WE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE BRAIN DAMAGE SHE HAD SUFFERED HAD VERY MUCH DISABLED HER. A STRONG PROUD WOMAN IN DIAPERS AND IN A WHEELCHAIR. ON AUGUST TWENTY NINTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN A NURSE AT REDWOOD SPRINGS ASSISTED MY MOTHER. OUT OF HER WHEELCHAIR AND LAUGHTER UNINTENDED. ON A COMMODE CHAIR. LEFT ALONE AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT OR CONTROL HER OWN BODY. ME MY MOM FELL HEAD FIRST. ONTO THE HARD TILE FLOOR. WITHOUT ANYTHING TO BREAK HER FALL. SHE SUSTAINED MASSIVE HEAD INJURIES. RESULTING IN NUMEROUS STITCHES AND GROSSING. SIX DAYS LATER. THE WOMAN I'VE KNOWN ALL MY LIFE TO BE A HARD WORKING LABOR. DIED ON LABOR DAY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT TOOK LARGE AMOUNTS OF MAKE UP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. COULD NEVER WORE MAKEUP TO COVER THE NINE STITCH WOUND AND MASS OF BRUISES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HER FACE IN ORDER. TO GET MY FAMILY AND I A CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE WITH AN OPEN CASKET SAD RIGHT. TODAY YOU HAVE THE POWER. THE POWER TO CHANGE THIS CONFUSING LAW TODAY I AM BEGGING YOU PLEASE VOTE YES. I ON AB. FIVE OH SIX ON BEHALF OF ME MAMA IN THOUSANDS OF DISABLED RESIDENTS WHO ARE AT RISK OF HARM. AT THE SALUTE IS THAT WOULD RATHER PAY A FINE THEN PROVE THE LAW. LET'S CHANGE THIS LAW THAT HAS CREATED CONFUSION FOR MANY YEARS. AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE. MY MOM DID NOT WANT TO DIE. MY MOM DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE THIS WAY. HOW YOU STATUS STEVEN AND POOR THEY HAVE THE KIND YET IS STUCK ON **** ON TEXAS THE UPON WHICH A SIGN YOU? BUT FELIZ RAGEL CABLE THING SEE. BUT I HAVE A SINGLE SET OF CITIES CRISIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS JIMMY FROM YOU AND I'M SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE OH SIX ESTABLISHES CONSISTENCY IN CONFORMITY IN THE LAW BY PROVIDING A MORE ACCURATE UPDATED CAUSATION DEFINITION IN DETERMINING IF ALONG IF A LONG TERM HEALTH CARE FACILITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RESIDENTS DEATH. AND INCREASES THE PENALTY AMOUNTS FOR FACILITY VIOLATIONS BUILDING OFF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN STATE AUDIT REPORT. REQUESTED IN PART BY DOCTOR WOULD. OUR BILL ALLOWS DPH TO FULFILL ITS MISSION OF PROPERLY IMPOSING CITATIONS FOR TO US AND WE'LL KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE. ALDERSON FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE AND IT ACCURATELY INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT QUALITY OF CARE. AS YOU HEARD FROM MARIA THE EXISTING STANDARDS FOR CITATION ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT NEGLIGENCE AND SOME FACILITIES. OUR BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR MUST BE TIED TO A VIOLATION OF FACILITY POLICY AND CAUSES OF DEATH. INSTEAD INCLUDE SITUATIONS WHERE FACILITY CONDUCT WAS SO NEGLIGENT THAT A REASONABLE PERSON WOULD CONSIDER IT LIKELY TO RESULT IN DEATH. IN ONE INSTANCE A RESIDENT WAS VENTILATOR DEPENDENT. REQUIRING IT TO BRIEF AND WHEN A RESPIRATORY THERAPIST THREAT -- TURNED OFF THE VENTILATOR CLEAN IT. THEY FORGOT TO TURN IT BACK ON IN THE INDIVIDUAL PASSED AWAY. THE JUDGE ENDED UP DISMISSING THE CLASS DOUBLE A VIOLATION AGAINST THE FACILITY BECAUSE HE FOUND THAT THE NURSING FACILITY DID NOT HAVE A POLICY OR PROCEDURE. REQUIRING A VENTILATOR TO BE TURNED BACK ON THE JUDGE SAID HE COULDN'T FIND A VIOLATION AND THEREFORE COULD NOT A PULL THE CLASS DOUBLE A CITATION. WOULD YOU TELL MANY MORE CASES JUST LIKE THIS IN OUR TWENTY SEVENTEEN INVESTIGATION KEEP NURSING HOME RESIDENTS SAFE. RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES BUT TREMENDOUS TRUST IN NURSING HOMES AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HONOR THAT BY COMMITTING TO A SYSTEM THAT EFFECTIVELY REGULATES NURSING HOMES. AND PROTECTS RESIDENTS. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA ALSO AGREES WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES AND THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN PART OF THEIR OPPOSITION LETTER. AND THAT WE DO NOT CONDONE BAD ACTORS OR IMPROPER CARE EITHER. THAT IS WHY THIS BILL WOULD ONLY IMPACT FACILITIES THAT FAILED TO LIVE UP TO THEIR PROMISE OF EXEMPLARY CARE. ADDITIONALLY IF THE FACILITY IS NOT FEEL IT HAS BEEN A PROPERLY CITED. THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS THAT ALLOWS FOR COVERAGE OF LEGAL EXPENSES. FINALLY THERE IS ALSO NO EVIDENCE THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF NURSING HOMES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES OR ELSEWHERE. IF SUCH A FACILITY WERE CLOSE IT WOULD ONLY AFFECT THOSE WHO DID NOT FOLLOW THE LAW AND THE STANDARDS OF PATIENT CARE. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE STAFF TO ACCOMMODATE MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE COVERED IN THE OPPOSITION LETTER. WHILE STILL MAINTAINING OUR CORE MISSION OF PROTECTING RESIDENTS. WE THANK MISTER KALRA FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE LEGISLATION FORWARD. TO SERVE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AND OUR STATE AND REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THE COMMON WITH THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. MARY HYATT FROM CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND AT HOME KERR AID AND A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT I SUPPORT THIS BILL EACH. SO ANYONE IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER SNYDER ON THE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES I WANT TO FIRST THANK AYE THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF FOR THE ATTENTION TO THIS BILL WE GREATLY APPRECIATED. AND AND THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE BOTH -- TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT WE THINK ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE -- WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT -- IT IS MAKES SENSE TO ROUTE TO RAISE THE PENALTIES THEY HAVE NOT BEEN RAISED IN A PERIOD OF TIME AND AND WE DO. BELIEVE THAT FACILITIES SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE WHEN THERE IS WRONGDOING -- AND SO ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE ELEMENTS THE BILL I'M ARE REMAINING CONCERNS DO REVOLVE AROUND ON THAT. THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW A I GUESS CHANGE THE ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. I HAD TO ARE. THE CAUSATION FACTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO MOVE A AND OF FACILITY A DOUBLE A CITATION FOR A FACILITY FROM PROXIMATE CAUSE TO SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR. AND WE HAVE A STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THAT WILL IMPACT OUR NURSING FACILITIES AND THEIR ABILITY TO REMAIN OPEN AND ALSO WITH THEIR ABILITY -- TO HAVE PATIENT ACCESS -- I HAVE MARK REAGAN WITH ME -- WHO IS LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITIES AND HE CAN BETTER EXPLAIN ARE CONCERNED SPECIFIC TO THAT BUT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT TO IMPORTANT OVERALL -- THINGS BEFORE WE BEFORE HEADED OVER TO MARK REAGAN OF FIRST IS THAT -- THE DISABILITY RIGHTS REPORTS THAT THEY MENTIONED THAT WAS THE INSTIGATOR FOR THIS BILL -- HAS A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN IT WHICH WE THINK -- ARE VERY IMPORTANT WE AGREE WITH -- THEY TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY THEY TALK ABOUT -- THE DEPARTMENT BEING MORE CONSISTENT IN THEIR APPLICATION THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE MORE CONSISTENT IN THEIR APPLICATION A MORE TIMELY IN THEIR APPLICATION. OF THE USE OF THEIR ENFORCEMENT -- THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT REPORT THAT EVEN MENTIONS THE DIFFERENCE OR THE NEED TO CHANGE -- THE STANDARD BY WHICH THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES A DOUBLE A CITATION -- IT MORE TALKS ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEM I TO DO A BETTER JOB -- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER THAT THE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM IS MEANT TO BE REMEDIAL IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK WITH FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY PROVIDE BETTER CARE QUALITY CARE -- TIMELINESS IS IMPORTANT MANY CITATIONS ARE NOT ISSUED FOR AT LEAST A YEAR IF NOT FOUR TO SIX YEARS BY THAT POINT IN TIME. THE FACILITY HAS MOVED ON FROM THAT EVENT -- AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUR FACILITIES IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN CORRECT AND WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. A TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO A BETTER JOB AND LASTLY I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WEIRD WE HAVE A VERY FRAGILE LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM. IN CALIFORNIA -- MOST OF OUR FACILITIES NURSING FACILITIES RELY PRETTY HEAVILY ON MEDI CAL FUNDING -- UPWARDS OF 65% FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED RELY A 100% ON MEDI CAL FUNDING. AND WE HAVE A THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY SIXTY FIVE EVERY YEAR -- WE HAVE MORE CUTE PATIENTS IN OUR FACILITIES AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE DETERMINE POLICIES LIKE THIS THAT WILL -- IN INCREASE INCREDIBLY ENHANCE THE ABILITY FOR OUR STATE DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE EE CITATIONS WHICH COULD PUT FACILITIES AT RISK OF CLOSURE WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE VERY CLOSELY SO. LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO MARK REAGAN TO MAKE A FEW MORE COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'VE BEEN PRACTICING IN THIS AREA I'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAW FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS JENNIFER SAID I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING THE STATE ASSOCIATION. THE OF THE ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A STRUCTURAL AND I WASN'T INVOLVED I'VE TRIED MANY OF THESE CASES I WASN'T INVOLVED IN THE VENTILATOR CASE THAT THERE WAS JUST SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT BUT HEARING THE REPORT. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS A FAILURE OF STRUCTURE BUT A FAILURE BY THE TRIAL JUDGE. TO DO THE RIGHT THING -- AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT STAY THAT SAY THAT RIGHT OUT FRONT. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE CHANGE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED. IS THAT THE NOTION OF PROXIMATE CAUSE WHICH IS REALLY THE UNDERLYING STANDARD THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IT STYLED AS DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE WHAT RIGHT THAT REALLY MEANS IS WHETHER THE UNDERLYING INCIDENT. WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE RESIDENTS DEATH. IS A LONG STANDING LEGAL PRINCIPLE THAT IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AS WAS CORRECTLY STATED. THERE WAS A STATE SUPREME COURT DECISION SAYING. JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON THE FIRST PRONG OF THAT TEST. NEED TO BE CLEARER FOR JURIES. BUT THERE'S TWO PARTS TO A PROXIMATE CAUSE ANALYSIS HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT DEALS WITH WHETHER OR NOT. THE UNDERLYING CAUSE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR AND THEN BEYOND THAT WHETHER OR NOT THAT BECAUSE WAS FORESEEABLE. WERE PRODUCED THE UNDERLYING DEATH AT ISSUE. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THERE WAS A SUBSEQUENT CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION BY THE NAME OF PPG INDUSTRIES VERSUS TRANSAMERICA THAT REAFFIRM THE PROXIMATE CAUSE IS THE TEST. AND IN THE CITATION SYSTEM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE NO INJURIES. THESE ARE JUDGE TRIALS THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN JUDGE TRIALS AND JUDGES CAN UNDERSTAND OR SHOULD UNDERSTAND. DESPITE THE LAST EXAMPLE WHAT PROXIMATE CAUSES ABOUT. IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THE WAY THAT THE REST OF THE CITATION SYSTEM IS STRUCTURED. HAS BURDENS THAT IF THIS AMENDMENT WOULD BE A DROP DEAD WOULD TRULY UNDERMINE THE WAY IN WHICH THESE CASES GET TRIED AND LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN. ONE OF THE PREREQUISITES FOR THIS LEVEL OF CITATION A DOUBLE A CITATION. IS THAT THERE BE A VIOLATION OF THE REGULATIONS THAT RISES TO A PARTICULAR LEVEL WHERE THERE IS AN IMMINENT DANGER OR A SUBSTANTIAL PROBABILITY OF DEATH OR SERIOUS HARM. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT PROOF THAT WOULD REQUIRE FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE NOTION THAT? TO PROVE THAT YOU EVEN CAN PROCEED WITH A DOUBLE A CITATION THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVE VERY IMMINENT. DANGER OF DEATH AND SO IF YOU PROVE AN IMMINENT DANGER OF DEATH. BUT THEN YOU ONLY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THAT THAT THAT BECAUSE WAS HE A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR. YOU'VE NOT REALLY TAKEN ACTION THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE SYSTEM. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HERE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC TO MAKE THE SYSTEM FAIR FOR ALL FOR BOTH CONSUMERS AND BOTH FACILITY OPERATORS. IS THAT BOTH PROBLEMS OF PROXIMATE CAUSE BE RETAINED. THANK YOU. WHO'S IN OPPOSITION. CHAIR MEMBERS CHAD HAMPTON ABUSING THE IS CALIFORNIA HERE AT RADICALLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF. AND THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR STAFFER FOR WORKING ON ON THE MINUTES TO THE BILL -- WE WOULD REAFFIRM OUR CONCERNS -- WITH THOSE MADE PREVIOUSLY BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITIES REGARDING TRUCK PARKED ACOSTA. BARBARA GLAZER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE TO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED OUR CONCERNS ARE THE SAME AS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WORKING ON THIS BILL. Q.. TERM MEMBERS CUT THE MUSTARD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES NECK NETWORK ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES AND APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THE MINUTES. THANK YOU. A MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER ROBERTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND THE TO THE AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS -- ISSUE TO THE FOREFRONT. HOWEVER WE WOULD CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE A DIALOGUE WITH INDUSTRY IS FOR SOME OF THE FINES AND THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DIALOGUE AND KEEP ME UPDATED ON THAT BUT I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER AND TO THE CHARGE ON THAT POINT I I WOULD DO WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION AND WE'VE BEEN REALLY GOING TO BE MAD. EITHER BY MYSELF MY STAFF BUT THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE OPPOSITION. NUMEROUS NUMEROUS NUMEROUS TIMES SO THERE'S NO LACK OF DESIRE TO TRY TO FIND A A COMMON GROUND SOMETIMES THERE ARE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION THAT OCCUR. I THINK THE A MAN'S INDICATE THAT -- THERE'S A CLEAR DESIRE THERE AND EVEN LAST YEAR -- EVEN THOUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF WAS SUPPORTIVE OF OF THIS CHANGE. WE KEPT WE WE HELD A BILL IN THE SENATE -- OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE OPPOSITION TO GIVE US MORE TIME TO TRY TO WORK ON AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY COULD. AND REINTRODUCE THE BILL THIS YEAR INSTEAD OF PUSHING FOR LAST YEAR HE PUT A GUN TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK WITH IT AND ALL I COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED -- BUT WE RESPECTED THE OPPOSITION ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO FIND COMMON GROUND. WITH SO YOUR CURRENT AND MISTER BOND. I THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER KALRA FOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE YOU'VE DONE IT FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW -- THE SONORA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER CLOSURE MY DISTRICT REALLY OPENED MY EYES TO THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE MANY OF OUR PATIENTS AND THE FACILITIES SPACE. I APPRECIATE YOUR DEDICATION ON THIS -- PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR OFTEN FRAGILE RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOMES AND LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE MANY AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN SO FAR THAT YOU'VE AGREED TO TAKE. AND I THINK THIS STRENGTHENED THE BILL SO FAR -- I CAN TELL YOU THAT I CAN TELL YOU WORKING REALLY HARD TO STAKEHOLDERS I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT I THINK YOU CAN GET TO COMMON GROUND I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN -- ALL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND WE'LL SEE HOW WE MOVES FORWARD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRING IT FORTH THANK YOU. MR BONTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FOR MISTER KALRA I JUST WANT TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THIS IS THE CHANGE IN THE STANDARD COMPONENT OF THE BILL OF NOT NOT NOT THE FINDS PEACE BUT THE THE CHANGE IN THE STANDARD. IN YOUR VIEW IS THE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR STANDARD. A LOWER STANDARD. THAN THE DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE STANDARD OR IS IN A A CLEARER STANDARD OR IT OR HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT. AT THAT OUR STANDARD. AND CERTAINLY MORE CLEAR DOES PROVIDE MORE CLARITY -- BUT CERTAINLY AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY THE DEPARTMENT -- PREFERS IT AND AND IN SUPPORT OF THIS CHANGE BECAUSE OF IT PROVIDES GREATER CLARITY FOR THEM AS WELL AND SO -- IT'S IT'S ALSO. A MORE COMMON PLACE USE STANDARD AND BUT ONE THAT WILL CREATE SOME CONSISTENCY WITH HOW THE DEPARTMENT. OF THE IN TERMS OF THE STANDARD THE DEPARTMENT USES AS WELL AS THE COURTS DEPARTMENTS RULINGS APPEALED IT GOES THE COURTS% USING THE SAME STANDARDS CRITICAL IN THAT SENSE. OKAY. AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE ARGUMENT MADE BY THE OPPOSITION THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR TEST IS THAT IS MEANT TO BE A TWO PART TEST. AND THIS TAKES -- JUST THE FIRST PART OF A TWO PART TEST IT. ANY ANY REFLECTION MORE TALK ANA WHAT WILL LET'S KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS A THERE IS A WIDE DISCRETION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND I THINK THAT. pSTANDARD. NARROWS THEIR DISCRETION IN TERMS OF REALLY BE ABLE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE FACTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL CASE AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MANY CASES THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL APPEALS 77%. ARE SAYS ONE APPEAL BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY NARROW STANDARD THIS IS DENTAL FACTOR STANDARD IS A MORE COMMONLY USED AND BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO HAVE. A GREATER ABILITY AND IN THIS CASE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN DETERMINING WHETHER A PARTICULAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY OR NOT. AND AND AS SUGGESTED BY THE OPPOSITION BY INCREASING THE FINES AND FEES -- THE THE FINES FOR THE THE CLASS A LEVEL IT ALSO GIVES -- SOME SORT OF SELF OF OF ASSURANCE SOME ASSURANCES FROM THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY DO DROP IT DOWN AT THE PENALTIES NOT SOON BE AS A KIND OF A SLAP ON THE WRIST THAT IS ACTUALLY COULD BE A MORE. SUBSTANTIVE COUNTY SO I THINK COMBINING BOTH USING A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR AND INCREASING THE PENALTIES FOR CLASS A. IN THESE TYPES OF CASES REALLY PROVIDES KIND OF THE TOOLS. NECESSARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- TO BUT HAVE THE THE FEE OR THE PENALTY FIT THE INCIDENT AT HAND MAC [inaudible] I'M. IF I UNDERSTAND THE MAGIC ADDRESSES GONZALEZ CASE OUT CORRECTLY THAT WAS ABOUT JURY INSTRUCTIONS. AND AND MAKING IT CLEAR FOR A JURY YOU KNOW A POOL OF IN A CROSS SECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS CLEAR TO THEM BUT THE THE DETERMINAR THE FINAL FACTOR THAT THAT THE THE PERSON MAKES DECISIONS AND AND THE CASE IS AT HAND IS IT OUR JUDGE. RIGHT SO [inaudible] IS IS. IS IT LESS NECESSARY TO HAVE THE YEAH THAT IS THE RATIONALE BEHIND MITCHELL VERSUS GONZALEZ. NOT AS PERSUASIVE IF WERE TALKING ABOUT A JUDGE. WHO UNDERSTANDS THE NUANCES BETWEEN DIFFERENT STANDARDS PROBABLY BETTER THAN A LAY PERSON WITHOUT LEGAL TRAINING -- AND AND THEN MAKE IT LESS NECESSARY TO HAVE A A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR TEST BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THE WHOLE RATIONALE BEHIND MITCHELL VERSES GONZALEZ WAS CLARITY FOR LAYPEOPLE WHEN RECEIVING A JURY INSTRUCTION. I DON'T I THINK IN EITHER CASE ESSENTIAL FACTORS MORE APPROPRIATE STANDARD IT ALLOWS. IN EITHER CASE YOU KNOW THE JUDGE AND THE JUDGE IS THE ARBITER IN THAT CASE THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO APPLY IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE BUT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD LIKE. IS TO HAVE A SIMILAR STANDARD BECAUSE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR FOR THEM MAKES MORE SENSE AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH -- THE CASE LAW AS WELL SO IT'S IT'S A KIND OF A BOTH OF THE CONSISTENCY ARGUMENT AS WELL AS A STAND THAT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR THEM AND THAT'S WHY THEY SUPPORT IT. AND AND I THE WAY A JUDGE AGAIN UP EVEN -- EVEN IF WHETHER IT'S A COURT TRIAL OR A JURY TRIAL I THE WAY THE STANDARD SHOULD BE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT. THANK YOU MISTER CARR THAT SUPER HELPFUL AND ANSWERED ONE FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME REFERENCE TO THE AUDIT. AND I BELIEVE THE AUDIT MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE BEYOND WHAT YOUR BILL CONTEMPLATES A THERE IS A REASON THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT THOSE. ISSUES IN THE AUDIT WERE WORTH PURSUING MAYBE YOU KNOW I KNOW OF ONE BILL CAN DO EVERYTHING BUT I JUST WANT TO ASK. I'LL BUT MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE TO PURSUE THEM WHAT DID YOU THINK THAT THEY WEREN'T APPROPRIATE. THIS IT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS ONE THAT I WAS WORKING ON WHEN THE AUDIT CAME OUT -- KIND OF MID STREAM AND SO -- I CATERED THE BILL -- AND AND DIRECTED THE BILL WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE AUDIT BASED UPON WHAT I WAS ALREADY WORKING ON SO -- RATHER THAN ADDING EXTRA STUFF TO IT WHICH I THINK IS NOT ONLY INEFFICIENT BUT ALSO -- YOU KNOW IT COULD BE CONSIDERED -- I I THINK -- WEALTH IS NOT I I DON'T THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH BILLS IS THAT NOT A COMES OUT KIND OF MISTREATMENT US TO STORE THE KITCHEN SINK IN THERE. THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY WERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT OUT THAT IN THAT AUDIT I KNOW THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE CHAIR AND MANY OTHERS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. IN THE FACILITIES -- AND A MANY THE AUTOMATIC RECOMMENDATIONS THE OUR OUR OPPOSITION ALSO -- AND HAS TAKEN TO HEART AND IS WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL SO IT'S NOT A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ASSIST TO TEN BILLS AND AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT CAN BE DONE. BUT THE DEPARTMENT WORKING DIRECTLY WITH -- BUT THE INDUSTRY ITSELF AND FOR THOSE THAT CANNOT THAT I'M SURE THEY'LL BE SUBSEQUENT LETS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD. NOT NESTLE FROM ME BUT THANK YOU MISTER KALRA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COURSE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SEE NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO YOU FOR CLOSE MISTER BECAUSE OF THIS SHOW ON ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU -- AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE INCREDIBLE WORK YOU'VE DONE I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD SOME I COME HERE BUT REALLY THE THE IF YOU'RE COMMITTEE STOP AS ON A TREMENDOUS JOB. OF THESE ARE VERY CHALLENGING ISSUES -- THIS. THIS HAS BEEN A BILL THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON OF HOPE. FOR FOR MANY MONTHS EIGHT GOING INTO A YEARS NOW AND I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT'LL BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND ULTIMATELY. THE SAFETY OF OTHER PATIENTS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THAT RESPECT THE ASPEN I BONE. BUT ONE THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND OBVIOUSLY BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A WHILE -- THIS DOES ENJOY -- DO PASS RECOMMENDATION HELLO I I I WILL SAY I AM SENSITIVE AND CONCERNED. THIS IS A VERY FRAGILE NETWORK AS WAS POINT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY THE OPPOSITION -- AND IN MY OWN DISTRICT I FACE THE CLOSURE OF THREE OF THE FIVE NURSING HOMES -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN I BELIEVE -- AND FORGE FORTUNATE WAS ONLY -- ONE BUT THE FRAGILITY OF THIS NETWORK IS OF GREAT CONCERN. AS IS THE SAFETY TO THE RESIDENTS AND SO AS WE BALANCE THESE THINGS -- THESE ARE THESE ARE DIFFICULT ISSUES SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AS YOU AS YOU HAVE -- AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WITH THAT I THINK ARE WITNESSES TO AND I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS AND I THINK YOU FOR COMING FOR WITH YOUR STORY -- THAT THAT'S AT THIS POINT OF LIKE -- WE HAVE A MOTION. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SECOND HERE US I'M SORRY SECOND BY MUSLIM ON A MOTION BY MISS CARILLO SECOND BY MISS THE MON THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS AND YOU'VE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENT SO -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT HI WHEN I MAYES NO MAYES NO AGUIAR-CURRY BIGELOW.

WILL NOT AFFECT THE FAMILY'S ABILITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO PROPER DONOR MEDICAL INFORMATION.

SEVEN NINETY EIGHT I HAVE A MOTION A SECOND [inaudible] EVERYTHING. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY NINE EIGHT TODAY I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE IT SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS AND WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR SUPPORT. AND ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL WE OFTEN CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF CHILDREN BUT THROUGH EACH EXPERIENCE ALSO EMERGES THE REBIRTH OF A WOMAN. WHOSE STORY IS OFTEN FORGOTTEN. MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS OF THE MOST COMMON COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY AND THE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA PERSIST. DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY CAN INCREASE A WOMAN'S FEELING OF ISOLATION CONFUSION AND AVOIDANCE WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER MAY NOT ASK FOR HELP AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN SUCH AS A LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OR POVERTY. CAN CONTRIBUTE TO POOR DETECTION AND TREATMENT RATES. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIA WOMEN WHO RECENTLY GAVE BIRTH EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. DURING OR AFTER PREGNANCY. THIS MEANS THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE THIS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. ONE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS IS A LOCK A MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR INSTANCE THERE IS ONLY ONE IDENTIFIED REPRODUCTIVE PSYCHIATRISTS AND RIVERSIDE AND VERY FEW COUNSELING AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR WOMEN. IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT THIS IS VERY TRUE STATEWIDE. THERE IS A MINIMAL SERVICES AVAILABLE IN MANY RURAL AREAS OF OUR STATE TO SUPPORT WOMEN SUFFERING FROM POST PARTUM MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. THE ONGOING SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS INCLUDE INCLUDING PSYCHIATRISTS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR WOMEN TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LIKE CANCER COUNSELING. IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY RATES OF PRENATAL DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND POST PARTUM DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS ARE BOTH HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE. AB SEVEN NINE EIGHT WILL CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM BASED ON A MODEL USED IN MASSACHUSETTS TO PROVIDE PSYCHIATRY TELE CONSULTATION AND VIRTUAL MENTORING SERVICES. THIS PILOT PROGRAM WILL OPERATE IN SEVERAL COUNTIES INCLUDING RIVERSIDE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF HEALTH PROVIDER SERVING PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN WOMEN UP TO ONE YEAR AFTER DELIVERY. AB SEVEN NINE A WILL HELP MAKE IMPORTANT PROGRESS TOWARD ENSURING THAT WOMEN WITH MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS CAN RECEIVE THE TREATMENT THAT THEY RECEIVE THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE. POST PARTUM SUPPORT DURING THIS CRITICAL TRANSITION SETS THE STAGE OF A WOMEN'S WELL BEING FOR MANY YEARS TO COME WE MUST NOT ALLOW WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES TO CONTINUE SUFFERING IN SILENCE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS EVA SWARTS. HI MY NAME'S EVA SCHWARTZ -- I AM A MOTHER WHO SUFFERED FROM POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS IT'S KIND OF POST PARTUM DEPRESSION ON STEROIDS -- I THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND MEDICATION SAVE MY LIFE.

WITHOUT EASY ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE AND GOOD DOCTORS I WOULD HAVE LOST MY FAMILY AND MY MIND. POST PARTUM PSYCHOSIS IS TREATABLE WITH PROFESSIONAL HELP. AND THIS IS WHY ANY YEAH THIS WHY WOMEN SUFFERING FROM ANY FORM OF POST PARTUM INTO IT. HEALTH DISORDERS MUST BE QUICKLY ASSESSED AND TREATED AND CAREFULLY MONITORED BY TRAINED.

TEN FOURTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TEN FOURTEEN WHICH REQUIRES HOSPITALS. AND HEALTH FACILITIES TO WRITE A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC. PRIOR TO DOWNGRADING CHANGING OR CLOSING THEIR FACILITIES M. REALLY THE SERVER IS SO COMMUNITIES CAN PLAN FOR THE IMPACT AND ALSO. A POTENTIALLY FIND ANOTHER OPERATOR SHOULD WANT SEEK TO LEAVE. HOSPITAL'S DECISION TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE SERVICES CREATE SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO OUR COMMUNITY. IN RECOGNITION OF THESE CHALLENGES CURRENT LAW REQUIRES A NINETY DAY NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC PRIOR TO REDUCING. EMERGENCY SERVICES OR THIRTY DAY NOTICE PRIOR TO CLOSING A HEALTH FACILITY. I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN LONG BEACH. OF THAT THESE TIME FRAMES ARE CERTAINLY. NOT LONG ENOUGH. IN MY DISTRICT JUST LAST YEAR COMMUNITY HOSPITAL OF LONG BEACH CLOSE ITS DOORS AFTER ABRUPTLY DIVERTING EMERGENCY ROOM PATIENTS TO OTHER HOSPITALS. THIS WAS DONE WITH VERY LITTLE NOTICE TO RESIDENTS AND VERY LITTLE TIME TO ENGAGE THE HOSPITAL. PROVIDER ON ALTERNATIVE TO THE CLOSURE IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTFUL TO MY COMMUNITY. AND REMAIN SO. AS RESULTS PATIENTS IN MY COMMUNITY NOW EXPERIENCE LONGER WAIT TIMES. FOR SERVICES LONGER AMBULANCE TRAVEL TIMES AND OVERCROWDING AT OTHER HOSPITALS. AND EMERGENCY ROOMS THIS IS IT EXPERIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE TO HAPPENING ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. PATIENTS AND RESIDENTS DESERVE ADEQUATE NOTICE TO REPAIR FOR CLOSURE THANK YOU LEADERSHIP BECAUSE THE SUFFICIENT TIME TO WORK TOWARDS AN ALTERNATIVE. IN MY DISTRICT A NEW PROVIDER HAS NOW BEEN SECURED WE BELIEVE. WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED ANY DISRUPTION AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. CENTRAL SERVICES HAD MY COMMUNITY AND GIVEN MORE NOTICE. AB TEN FOURTEEN WILL PROVIDE COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY INVESTIGATE ALL OTHER OPTIONS INCLUDING SECURING A NEW PROVIDER. TO PREVENT A CLOSURE OF A CRITICAL HOSPITAL. AT THE VERY LEAST THIS BILL ALLOWS PATIENTS A RESIDENTS TO BETTER PREPARE FOR WHAT THEY WILL DO IN THE NEXT EMERGENCY. NOW THAT THE LOCAL HOSPITAL MAYBE GONE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION AND SIR FLOCKS OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION MISTER CHAIR. PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION WHERE THE SPONSORS OF AB -- TEN FOURTEEN AB TEN FOURTEEN OF A COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL HOSPITALS ARE UNIQUE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND A VITAL PART OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST. WHILE SOME MAY BE RUN BY A CORPORATION THEY ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF PUBLIC SERVICE SAVING LIVES AND PROTECTING PATIENTS HOSPITALS ARE WHERE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE BORN THERE WERE OUR NEIGHBORS GO WHEN THEY GET SICK AND THEY ARE SAFE PLACE WHEN A WILDFIRE OR OR EARTHQUAKE STRIKES. WHEN A CLOSURES ANNOUNCED NURSES ELECTED OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE SOMETIMES ABLE TO GALVANIZE A CITY AND KEEP THE HOSPITAL OPEN OR FIND ANOTHER WORKABLE SOLUTION? UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES WE ARE NOT ABLE TO KEEP FACILITIES OPEN AND THEY CLOSE LEAVING NEIGHBORHOODS IN A HEALTH CARE DESERT. INCREASE NOTICE TIMELINES MEAN BETTER OUTCOMES FOR YOUR CITY AND MORE TIME FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY WILL RECEIVE HEALTH CARE. FOR WHERE THEIR NEXT JOB WILL BE. AT THE BARE MINIMUM CALIFORNIANS ARE ENTITLED TO ADEQUATE NOTICE OF A HOSPITAL CLOSING. CNA IS GRATEFUL TO OUR THREE JOINT AUTHORS WHO'VE ALL EXPERIENCED AND ANNOUNCED HOSPITAL CLOSURE IN THEIR DISTRICT. AND UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THIS ISSUE NURSES ARCHER SUPPORT ON AB. TEN FOURTEEN VERY MUCH BEFORE YOU BEFORE I LET YOU GO LET MISTER BRO ONE OF THE JOINT AUTHORS TESTIFY AND I I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR I WASN'T GIVEN NOTICE. ON THE BILL THIS EXTRA GIVING NOTICE THE MISTER ROSE GOING TO SHOW. THAT I AM HAVING THAT THERE IS NO NOTICE BUT YOU WILL NOTICE THAT ARE NOTICING AUTHOR YOU'RE READING OF MY TWO MINUTES -- NO I'M I'M JUST HERE I'M PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHORS I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED MY FIRST YEAR IN THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE. MY DISTRICT HAD THREE EMERGENCY ROOMS HAVE MISSION HOSPITAL WHICH IS OUR REGIONAL TRAUMA CENTER. AND TO HOSPITALS IN LAGUNA HILLS IN SAN CLEMENTE SO THE PROVIDER -- DECIDED TO CLOSE THE FACILITY WE ATTEMPTED RUN LEGISLATION IT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL BUT THE THING THAT REALLY GOT ME ENGAGED IS THAT ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS WRITE A LETTER TO THE COUNTY. ANNOUNCING A CLOSURE AND RESIDENTS CONSTITUENTS ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL REALLY HELP US WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT -- EMERGENCY ROOMS OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE -- FORM OF HEALTH CARE BUT WE DO NEED MORE NOTICE AND THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY GOT ME FROM MY SITUATION. WAS THAT THE PROVIDER WAS A NOT FOR PROFIT ENTITY. AND THEY GET THAT NONPROFIT STATUS BY PROVIDING A COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT THEY NO LONGER WERE PROVIDING IN THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE WHICH IS MY SECOND LARGEST CITY. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE VISIT THE COAST. AND YOU KNOW JUST LIKE THAT TWO MONTHS LETTER TO THE COUNTY -- THEY ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURE SO. THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE -- DONE TO DISCUSS IT FIND OTHER OPTIONS MR O'DONNELL CITY IS. THEY'RE NOT LUCKY FOR HOSPITAL CLOSING BUT AT LEAST THE CITY ON THE LAND IN MY SITUATION THE OPERATOR ON THE HOSPITAL AND THE LAND. SO NOW IT'S JUST A FENCED OFF CLOSE HOSPITAL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PEROT MISS MISS BLOCKS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SERAPH LOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AS WE'VE SEEN HOSPITALS ARE REALLY THE BACKBONE OF MANY COMMUNITIES THEY PROVIDE HEALTHCARE SERVICES BUT ALSO COMMUNITY BENEFITS CHARITY CARE. HEALTH EDUCATION HEALTH BEARS -- AND ALSO ARE OFTEN THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES SO THERE'S A REAL IMPACT WHEN THEY CLOSE -- SUE THIS JUST GIVES ENOUGH NOTICE FOR A COMMUNITY TO TO PREPARE FOR A CLOSER OR FOR A DOWNGRADE IN SERVICES I DID WANT TO ADDRESS -- THE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO ARGUMENTS IN THE OPPOSITION OR IN THAT -- ANALYSIS THEY DID SAY THAT. OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED IF THEY HAD CONFORMITY WITH THE WARN ACT -- WHICH IS SIXTY DAYS. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A WALMART CLOSING WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT A FACTORY CLOSING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THAT PLAY AND WARMUS ROLES IN COMMUNITIES IT TAKES MORE THAN SIXTY DAYS. TO PREPARE FOR THAT KIND OF CHANGE IN A COMMUNITY AND THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES TO DEPEND ON THIS -- AND EVEN WITH THE WARN ACT OTHER STATES HAVE DIFFERENT TIMELINES BECAUSE THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT SIXTY DAYS ISN'T ENOUGH -- AND THE WARN ACT WAS DESIGNED AROUND A VERY PARTICULAR TIE AND KIND OF CLOSURE SO I WOULD SAY. A HOSPITAL IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT IT'S NOT JUST AN EMPLOYER AND A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIMELINE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AMY BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LONG BEACH TO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL FOR CARRYING THE BILL OR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME ON UP YEAH. CATHERINE ALSO SCARRING THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I'M WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A BALANCE IN OUR OPPOSITION -- AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE HOSPITALS DO CLOSE FOR MARRIED OF REASONS -- SOME FINANCIAL SOME BECAUSE OF A SERVICE GOING DOWN TO A LEVEL WHERE -- WE MAY NEED TO RETHINK THE USE OF THAT HOSPITAL TO ANOTHER SERVICE -- BECAUSE THOSE HOSPITAL SERVICES AREN'T USED AS FREQUENTLY SO SAFETY BECOMES AN ISSUE -- SO WE ARE WE WERE UP WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO ADJUST TO THE NINETY DAY TIME FRAME FOR A CHANGE IN SERVICE WE MAY CHANGE OUR SERVICE AGAIN FOR MERRY REASONS YOU MAY HAVE A DOCTOR LEAVE. A BURN UNIT AND YOU NO LONGER HAVE A DOCTOR TO MANAGE THE BURN PATIENTS YOU MAY HAVE A KEY MEDICAL STAFF LEAVE I'M FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS WON'T ALLOW FOR THAT CHANGE IN SERVICE THAT THEN COULD CREATE PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES. OR CRATE BACKLOGS IN OTHER AREAS -- AND THEN WE DO OFFER THE SIXTY DAYS BECAUSE WHEN A HOSPITAL HAS TO CLOSE ONCE THEY ANNOUNCE -- YOU CAN ALL APPRECIATE WHEN YOUR EMPLOYER TELLS YOU THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS START LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB. AND FRANKLY FOR A SYSTEMS THEY TRY AND FIND THEIR NURSES DOCTORS. OR DOCTORS BUT THERE NURSES. I DON'T APPLY THEM -- AND THEIR OTHER EMPLOYEES THEY TRYING TO FIND THEM OTHER POSITIONS AND OTHER FACILITIES TO BECOME OPEN AND I MEAN PART OF THE SYSTEM HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. CREATES WHAT WE CAN'T WHAT WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS AN IMBALANCE IN I'M BEING ABLE TO RETAIN OUR EMPLOYEES AND MAINTAIN THE SAFETY IN THE SYSTEM SO. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THAT TIME FRAME AND HAVE OFFERED UP OTHER TIME FRAMES WE BELIEVE PROVIDE THAT BALANCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEE NUMBER BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. QUESTION MISTER MISS RODRIGUEZ WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR BRING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL FORD AS YOU KNOW THE PAST WORKING IN THAT YOU MASS INDUSTRY. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE OUR FACILITIES OPEN PROVIDING SERVICE. AND THE MORE TIME WE HAVE WHEN THEY DO LOOK TO CLOSE THE BETTER TO PREPARE OURSELVES AS WERE TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. MINUTES ARE CRUCIAL IN SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND BY THAT DELAY GOING TO OUR FOR THE HOSPITAL. EVEN -- INCREASES THEIR CHANCES OF MAYBE NOT SURVIVING SAUNA THANK OF THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS -- VERY IMPORTANT BEFORE I THINK TALKING WITH OPPOSITION TALKING ABOUT -- MAYBE TOO MUCH TIME IT SHOULD BE SHORTER BUT THEN WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT AS WERE LOOKING TO GET THESE EMPLOYEES OTHER JOBS IN OTHER AREAS WE NEED TO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION THEY MAY HAVE TO MOVE RIGHT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE TIME AND COST. TO FIND IN YOUR HOUSE APARTMENT OR WHATNOT -- SO I THINK THE MORE TIME THE BETTER SO JUST THINK OF BRINGS A VERY IMPORTANT BEFORE THANK YOU. LOOK FOR THE SUPPORTED AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SO -- FIRST ONE WITH AND ONE THANK YOU FOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD I KNOW WHAT A DIFFICULT TIME YOU WENT THROUGH IN IN YOUR DISTRICT LAST YEAR -- RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF THE HOSPITAL -- AND DIE THIS BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THE STREET ON S. RIVAL THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND MOTION BY MISTER RODRIGUEZ A SECOND BY MISTER RAMOS. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES. MAYES NOT VOTING OCCUR CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BONTA. BURKE I AM BURKE I CARILLO. CARILLO I'D FLORA. FOR NOT VOTING LIMóN. MON I MCCARTY. THIS AREA. RAMOS. ROSS I RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO. WALDRON. YOUR BILL HAS -- SEVEN SEVEN VOTES WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] MR QUIRK. YEAH AB ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF WHO WORK SO HARD ON THIS BILL WITH US. AND ALSO THANKS -- TO MY STAFF MEMBER HERE PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER -- AB ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT REQUIRES PRO BIOTIC MANUFACTURERS TO LABEL THEIR PRODUCT WITH THE GENUS SPECIES AND STRAIN OF MICRO ORGANISMS. IN DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS AS WELL AS A TOTAL ESTIMATED COUNT OF LIFE MICRO ORGANISMS. CURRENT FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO LIST AND QUALIFY INGREDIENTS IN DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. TRADITIONAL DIETARY INGREDIENTS LIKE CALCIUM LISTING THE COMMON NAME AND QUAN I FIND BY WEIGHT MAKES INTUITIVE SENSE. FOR LIVE MICRO ORI ORGANISMS IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE A METRIC THAT ACTUALLY AFFECTS HOW MANY ARE LIVE. IS ALSO CRITICAL TO IDENTIFY THEM AT THE STRAIN LEVEL HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IS. FIRST ERIC LEVY WHO'S A PHD STUDENT STUDYING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT UC BERKELEY AND WHO SUGGESTED THIS BELL. AND THEN SACK ABBOTT WHO'S A PHD SCIENTIST IN THE C. E. O. Z. BIOTICS. LOW CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT AB. ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT MY NAME IS ERIC LEE AND I'M A PHD STUDENT STUDYING MICROBIOLOGY AT UC BERKELEY. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I PARTICIPATED IN A COMPETITION HOSTED BY THE UC CENTER OF SACRAMENTO. THIS COMPETITION ASKED GRADUATE STUDENTS IN SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH FIELDS. TO DRAW FROM OUR EXPERTISE AND PROPOSE NEW POLICY IDEAS. MY PROPOSAL WAS SELECTED AS THE WINNING PROPOSAL AND IS THE IDEA BEHIND AB. ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT AS A RESEARCHER WHO STUDIES BACTERIA FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVE OFTEN ASKED ME WHETHER THEY SHOULD TAKE OVER THE COUNTER PROBIOTICS OR DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS THAT CONTAIN LIKE LIVE MICRO ORGANISMS TO TREAT HEALTH PROBLEMS. I'M USUALLY HESITANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE EVERY PERSON HAS A UNIQUE MIXTURE OF TRILLIONS OF BACTERIA IN THEIR GUT. WHICH CAN CHANGE PROBIOTICS EFFECTIVENESS FROM PERSON TO PERSON. FURTHERMORE EVEN IF A CURE ALL BACTERIA EXISTED I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PICK IT OFF THE SHELF OF MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE BECAUSE MOST SUPPLEMENT LABELS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DETAIL FOR ME TO FIND A THAT BACTERIA. MOST LABELS INCLUDE BACTERIA SPECIES. BUT SCIENTISTS PREFER TO USE AN ADDITIONAL LABEL LAYER OF SPECIFICITY WHICH IS CALLED THE STRAIN. YOU CAN THINK OF BACTERIAL STRAINS LIKE BREEDS OF DOGS. ALL DOGS ARE THE SAME SPECIES BUT IF YOU IMAGINE THE DOCKS IN AS A POLICE CANINE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SPECIFICITY PASSED THE SPECIES LEVEL IS IMPORTANT. SIMILARLY A BACTERIA STRAIN CAN IMPACT ITS FUNCTION. SOME STRAINS OF E. COLI OUR FOOD CONTAMINANTS CAUSING DIARRHEA KIDNEY FAILURE OR DEATH. OTHER E. COLI CAN HELP TREAT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BACTERIA STRAIN THAT INFORMATION IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE LISTED ON A MANUFACTURED. MANUFACTURER LABEL UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL LAW. CURRENTLY ABEL'S ALSO LIST PROBIOTIC INGREDIENTS BY WEIGHT WHICH COUNTS BOTH LIVE AND DEAD ORGANISMS. TO FIND THE NUMBER OF VIABLE MICRO ORGANISMS WILL CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONALLY TO TRANSPARENCY AND PRODUCT INTEGRITY. THE US PROBIOTIC MARKET IS PROJECTED TO REACH SIX AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. THE COST ALONE SHOULD BE AN INCENTIVE TO IMPROVE LABELING PRACTICES SO CONSUMERS CAN KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S IN THEIR SUPPLEMENTS. MORE DETAILED STREAM LEVEL LABELING WILL ALLOW CONSUMERS TO COMPARE PRODUCTS BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS AND ENSURE THAT THIS CRUCIAL INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL. THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH. AB. MANNER. YEAH. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR -- AND COMMITTEE FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. MY NAME IS ZACH ABIT -- AND I AM CEO OF HIM JUST GO BASED PROBIOTICS COMPANY CALLED THE BIOTICS. AS YOU MAY KNOW PROBIOTICS ARE LIVE ORGANISMS THAT ARE CONSUMED FOR THE VARIOUS BENEFITS THAT THEY MAKE HIM. FOR THIS ISSUE OUT HIS ME THE ISSUE IS THAT NOT ALL PROBIOTICS ARE THE SAME AS WE JUST HEARD ON AND NOT ALL COME FOR THE SAME BENEFITS TO THE SAME PEOPLE. ARE THE FIRST PROVISION OF THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT THE GENUS SPECIES AND STRAINED BE SPECIFIED ON THE LABEL THIS IS CRITICAL FOR MULTIPLE REASONS. FIRST DIFFERENT STRAINS OF BACTERIA EVEN WITHIN THE SAME SPECIES VERY WIDELY. THE DISTINCTION ABOUT WHAT STRAIN SPECIFICALLY IS IN THE PRODUCT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR PROBIOTICS BUSINESSES LIKE MINE. ONE STRAIN WITHIN A SPECIES MAY HAVE A BENEFICIAL FUNCTION ACTIVITY ANOTHER STRAIN DOES NOT HAVE. FOR INSTANCE WE SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS ARE DEVELOPING AND TESTING ARE SPECIFIC STRAIN OF A PROBIOTIC CALL BE SETTLES. OUR STRAIN B. SUBTLEST ZB. ONE EIGHTY THREE IT HAS A UNIQUE FUNCTION THAT ALLOWS IT TO ELIMINATE A SPECIFIC TOXIN FROM YOUR GOT. OTHER STRAINS OF BE SUBTLEST DO NOT HAVE THIS FUNCTION. AND WITHOUT A REQUIREMENT FOR MANDATORY STRAIN LABELING BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW OR LABEL WHETHER OR NOT -- THEY HAVE A FUNCTIONAL OR USEFUL STREAM. BUSINESSES SUCH AS MINE ARE PREDICATED ON THE FACT THAT ONE STRAIN IS NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER. AND THERE'S A VERY AND THERE'S VERY SOUND SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THAT. WE GO THROUGH A GREAT DEAL OF SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN RIGOR TO ISOLATE DEVELOPING CHARACTER AYE STRAINS AND FILE PATENTS TO PROTECT THE STRAINS FOR THE PURPOSES OF EXCLUSIVE USE. WITHOUT MANDATORY STRAIN LABELING THIS EFFORT IS UNDER CUT AND MADE USELESS I SINCE CURRENTLY THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE SPECIFIC STRAIN BE IDENTIFIED. I SUCH IN THE INTEREST OF TRANSPARENCY AND ALLOWING CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED PURCHASING DECISIONS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN ABOUT PROBIOTICS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE MANDATORY LABELING OF THE GENUS SPECIES AND STRAIN FOR ALL PROBIOTICS. IN ADDITION BECAUSE TRAINS ARE SO DIFFERENT HOW SUCH DIFFERENT PROPERTIES MANUFACTURERS OF PROBIOTICS SHOULD KNOW WHAT SPECIFIC SHRINK THEY'RE PUTTING INTO THEIR PRODUCTS WITHOUT REQUIREMENT TO LABEL THE SPECIFIC STRAIN. THERE'S ALSO NO REQUIREMENT TO KNOW WHAT STRANGERS IN THE BOTTLE THIS IS NOT THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC OR THE PRODUCT AND SHE THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. BRANDON MARCH WITH A CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ANTHONY SAMPSON WITH ARNOLD AND PORTER ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL FOR RESPONSIBLE NUTRITION IN THE AMERICAN HERBAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION. TRADED SEARCHES AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH COMPRISE OF THE SIGNIFICANT. AMOUNT OF MANUFACTURERS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS BILL. WE ARE ACTUALLY A SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT -- INSTANTLY MEMBER QUIRK IS IS TRYING TO DO. OUR FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIONS IS THE CONFLICT RIGHT NOW WITH WITH THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO. AND WITH FEDERAL LAW AT A TIME WHEN THE FDA IS ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- ON THIS ISSUE. AND FOR THAT REASON WHAT WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER A BIT. IS THE IDEA OF MOVING A RESOLUTION TO ENCOURAGE THE FTA TO MOVE FORWARD WITH REGULATIONS -- TO AMEND ITS REGULATIONS -- TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO DO AND LET ME JUST EXPLAIN. WITH THE CURRENT REGULATIONS SAY THAT LIVE MICROBIAL DIETARY INGREDIENTS MUST BE QUANTIFIED -- BY WEIGHT ON THE SUPPLEMENT FACTS LABEL. AND BUT COLONY FORMING UNITS IN ANY OTHER METRIC FOR THAT MATTER ARE NOT AN OFFICIAL MEASUREMENT. ALLOWED TO APPEAR ON THE SUPPLEMENT FACTS LABEL WE DISAGREE WITH THAT. AND THAT'S WHY -- C. R. AND AND AMERICAN HERBAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION SUPPORTED -- A PETITION BY THE INTERNATIONAL PROBIOTICS ASSOCIATION -- TO REQUIRE -- LABELS TO INCLUDE CF USE AS METRICS FOR LIVE MICROBIAL INGREDIENTS. AND THE FDA RESPONDED WITH DRAFT GUIDANCE -- ALLOWING BOTH -- THE THE COLONY FORMING UNITS TO BE EXPRESSED -- FOR PURPOSES OF CHARACTERIZING LIVE MARK MICROBIAL INGREDIENTS AS WELL AS THE WEIGHT AND SO WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH THAT. WE THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND AGAIN WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE FDA TO AMEND ITS REGULATION TO SIMPLY SAY THE COLONY FORMING UNITS AT THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES. TO DETERMINE -- THE AMOUNT OF LYE MICRO PEELS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE BEST OTHER PROVISION IDENTIFYING GENUS SPECIES AND STRAIN WERE ALSOVERY SUPPORTIVE OF OF WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS TRYING TO DO. ON THIS IN FACT THE COUNCIL FOR RESPONSIBLE NUTRITION AND THE INTERNATIONAL PROBIOTICS ASSOCIATIONS GUIDELINES. OUR STATE THAT THE LABEL SHOULD IDENTIFY THE GENUS SPECIES AND STRAIN FOR EACH MICRO ORGANISM IN THE PRODUCT AND THAT'S IN FACT -- CURRENT PRACTICE -- FOR THEIR MEMBERS -- AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE FDA ISSUED GUIDANCE FOR NEW DIETARY SUPPLEMENT INGREDIENTS. SPECIFYING WHAT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDING THOSE NEW NOTIFICATIONS WHICH INCLUDES A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE ORGANISM. INCLUDING THE STRAIN SO AGAIN ON BOTH IF ISSUES WE SEE THE FTA GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHAT WE WOULD PREFER IS TO SEE THE FTA. GO THAT DIRECTION THE DOCTOR QUIRK IS SEEKING TO GO. AND ESTABLISH A UNIFORM LABELING REQUIREMENT FOR THESE PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE USED -- THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITHOUT SEPARATE STATE LEVEL REQUIREMENTS SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME [inaudible] SIR. HELLO MY NAME IS CARLOS COULD HERE IS I'M WITH THE CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WITH A TRADE ASSOCIATION OF WASHINGTON DC. THE REPRESENT OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINES AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. THE ANTHONY DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT OUR OR SIMILAR CONCERNS ARE WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO WHAT'S IN THE BILL -- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT ARE OPPOSITION LIES MOSTLY IN THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT A LINE CURRENTLY WITH FTA. AND WE ALSO HAVE -- PETITIONED FTA TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION -- AS RECENTLY AS NOVEMBER OF THIS LAST YEAR -- THEY ARE DUE TO COME OUT WITH THE RULES ON THIS ISSUE. HOPEFULLY SOONER BETTER THAN LATER AND AGAIN WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THIS WE APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT TO THE FOREFRONT -- OR OPPOSITION JUST LIES IN THE FACT THAT IT'S CURRENTLY NOT ALIGNED WITH FTA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THE BILL SECOND. ONE QUESTIONS MISTER MISTER MAYES [inaudible] SO -- THIS IS FASCINATING -- A COUPLE OF WELL THE DOCTOR IN A COUPLE OF WANT TO BE DOCTORS SAID THAT ARE HERE -- I DID NOT STUDY -- SCIENCE I STUDIED POLITICAL SCIENCE WITH SOME WOULD ARGUE. IS NOT A SCIENCE AT ALL -- BUT MY MY QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION IS -- I DO UNDERSTAND -- THE ROLE OF THE OF US GOVERNMENT -- AND I'M SOMEBODY WHO DEEPLY BELIEVES IN THIS IDEA OF FEDERALISM. AND OFTEN TIMES -- WE HAVE -- FOLKS THAT COME DOESN'T SAY -- WE DON'T WANT CALIFORNIA TO SET THEIR OWN -- STANDARDS OUR OWN RULES WE WANT THEM CONGRESS TO DO IT WE WANT WASHINGTON DC TO DO IT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT DOING MUCH OF OF ANYTHING AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE. HOPING THAT THE FDA WHICH IS ONE OF THE AGENCIES WILL WILL COME UP WITH -- WILL COME UP WITH SOMETHING BUT WHY CAN'T CALIFORNIA HAVE ITS OWN RULES AND IF YOU AGREE THAT -- THAT DOCTOR COURTS BILL -- IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA STANDARD THE THAT AND WRITE IT HERE THAT THE FDA CAN USE IT AS A AS A GUIDELINE. YEAH I MEAN IT'S A GOOD QUESTION WEEK KNOWLEDGE THE CALIFORNIA CAN DO. WHAT IT WANTS AND IT AND IT'S AND IT'S DOING THAT RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT THE ISSUES THAT TYPICALLY WHEN WE SEE NEW LABELING MANDATES AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS? WHAT WE'RE TYPICALLY SEEING IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OR TAKING NO ACTION AT ALL THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE WE JUST SAW FTA TAKE ACTION? ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL. AS EARLY AS LATE LAST YEAR AND WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THEY DO AND THE FACT THAT FTA IS GOING IN THEIR DIRECTION. THAT WE WANT THEM TO GO IN CONSISTENT WITH THIS BILL OUR POSITION IS THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST HAVE A UNIFORM FEDERAL STANDARDS. THAT CALIFORNIA CAN BE GET BEHIND IT THAT WE CAN ALL SUPPORT. IF FTA WAS NOT MOVING ON THIS AND THEY WERE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SAYING CALLING FORMING UNITS. COUNTY FORMING UNITS IS NOT APPROPRIATE METRICS. DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GOT UP HERE AND AND AND JUSTIFY THAT WHEN WHEN CALIFORNIA SEEKING TO GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH A FIFTY DOESN'T MOVE WHAT IF THEY DON'T ACT WOULD BE IMPROPER FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACT WOULD YOU STILL BE WOULD BE SUPPORT SUPPORTED THAT THE FDA IF YOU KNEW THE FDA WASN'T I'M GOING TO ACT WOULD YOU STILL WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE. I THINK WE LIKE TO SEE AFTER GIVE FTA THE CHANCE GIVEN THAT THEY'RE GETTING. LOS WE THINK ALLOW THAT TO TAKE ITS COURSE AND IF THEY DON'T TAKE ACTION. THAT WE MAY FIND OURSELVES HERE AGAIN NEXT YEAR AND AND GO FROM THERE COULD BE AMENDED THE BILL AMEND LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD SAY THAT IF THE FDA DID ACT -- THAN -- THAT WOULD SORT SUPER CEDAR -- BUT WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE OF OF OF THAT SO IN IN LIGHT OF THE FACT MAYBE THE FDA WON'T. ACT WE STILL HAVE THE CALIFORNIA RULE. I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE FDA'S GOING IN THIS GENERAL DIRECTION AND THEY COULD HAVE A PROVISION THAT'S DIFFERENT. AND AND IT MIGHT NOT BE OBJECTIONABLE BUT IT WOULD BE ONE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS. AND SO I'D RATHER SEE THE LETTER THE FDA PROCESS TAKE ITS COURSE. SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE AND AGAIN IF THEY DON'T MOVE IN THEY DON'T GO IN THAT DIRECTION AND TO THE EXTENT. CALIFORNIA WHICH IS TO DO A RESOLUTION URGING THE FDA TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY WITH THE PRESENCE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENT. COMPANIES IN THIS STATE AND THEY DON'T GO THAT DIRECTION. THAT'S THEIR DECISION WE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD AND IF THEY DIDN'T WE AGAIN LIKE I SAID CAN FIND OURSELVES BACK HERE AND HAVE THE DISCUSSION YEAH. OKAY [inaudible] OTHER QUESTIONS. I I HAVE TO FIND THIS A FASCINATING DISCUSSION -- THE SUBJECT MATTER ANOTHER DOCTOR THE LACK OF SCIENCE OVER HERE -- I THINK THAT I I I I APPRECIATE WITH THE OPPOSITION IS IS IS COMING FROM BUT I ALSO HAVE TO RAISE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT MIGHT CULTURE DID -- OR MY MOISTURE DID AND THAT'S FREE WITH REGARDS TO WHAT IF THE FDA DOESN'T ACT -- WE IN THE LEGISLATURE HERE WE'RE DEALING -- WAITING FOR THE FDA TO ACT ON E. CIGARETTES -- AND COMING OUT WITH CONCLUSIONS ABOUT E. CIGARETTES AND WE WAITED AND NOTHING HAPPENED AND WE ALSO REALLY TOOK ACTION HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THEN THE FDA DID ULTIMATELY. MAKE SOME CONCLUSIONS THERE -- I KNOW MR QUIRK IS A SCIENTIST -- AND I KNOW THAT MR QUIRK APPRECIATES THE VALUE OF OF DATA AND AND AND DOCTOR QUIRK EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN CORRECTED. DR COURT. IS A IS A SCIENTIST -- AND I PRETTY AND I KNOW HE APPRECIATES FOR STATES THAT -- MY HOPE IS THAT -- THIS IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT -- HE'LL BE MINDFUL OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE FDA AND THAT IF THERE IS A CONFLICT THAT THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY RESOLVED BUT I SEE AN OVERWHELMING CONSIDERATION FOR THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION TO THE CONSUMER. AND I DON'T QUITE FRANKLY HAVE A LOT OF FAITH THAT THE FTA. WAS GOING TO ACT ANYTIME SOON -- IF THEY DO -- THAT I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT MIS CHARACTERIZATION BUT THE TRACK RECORD IS IS NOT THAT THEY ARE. PARTICULARLY EXPEDIA AND IN RESOLVING A LOT OF THESE ISSUES SO -- SO WITH THAT I WAS KIND OF A LONG. THANK YOU FOR MY CLOTHES OKAY. OF THE BILL DOES -- ENJOYED DO PASS RECOMMENDATION DOCTOR QUIRK WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU. FOR WE DO HAVE -- A MOTION -- BY MISTER MISS AGUIAR-CURRY A SECOND BY MISS BURKE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS.

THIS AREA RAMOS. RAMOS AYE RODRIGUEZ. RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO WALDRON [inaudible] NINETY YOUR BILL HAS NINE VOTES I OUT OF COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH BILLION TO ROLL OVER FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON AND FOR THE RECORD WILL COSTS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE A SOCIAL SCIENCE. SO -- MISS PARQUET HAND NOT A SCIENTIST SINCE WE'RE TAKING ROLE AND HE THE SCIENTISTS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AN AB THIRTEEN OH NINE WHICH WOULD EXTEND CALIFORNIA'S ANNUAL SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD. IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET BY TWO ADDITIONAL WEEKS ALLOWING MORE CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO HEALTH COVERAGE THROUGH A BILL. AB THIRTEEN OH NINE REMOVED THE OPEN ENROLLMENT DEADLINE FROM ITS CURRENT JANUARY FIFTEENTH TO JANUARY THIRTY FIRST FOR PEOPLE TO PURCHASE INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE COVERAGE. EITHER THROW STATE'S EXCHANGE COVERED CALIFORNIA -- OFF EXCHANGE. AND IT HELPS CONTINUED ACCESS WE HAVE NEARLY TWO AND A HALF MILLION CONSUMERS THAT PURCHASE IN THIS MARKET PLACE. AND WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE TIME TO DO SO AND GIVING THEM TIME ONLY DURING THE HOLIDAYS WHEN THEY'RE RUSHED ISN'T WORKING. THIS YEAR WHEN WE HAD IT MOVED TO JANUARY FIFTEENTH WE SAW A GIVING THESE EXTRA TWO WEEKS CAN REALLY ENSURE THAT ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS. TO COVERAGE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. WITH ME TODAY ARE M. J. DS FROM HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA AND LINDA IT. TENER RULE X. FELL BY OTHER RIGHT AND GET MINE WRONG CENTER AND GET RIGHT. FROM THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK TO SPEAK ON THE BILL. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND JDS HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. PROUD TO SPONSOR AB THIRTEEN OH NINE WHICH PROVIDE WOULD PROVIDE CONSUMERS TO ADDITIONAL WEEKS TO SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. TWO YEARS AGO YOUR COMMITTEE SUPPORTED LEGISLATION THAT PRESERVE CALIFORNIANS THREE MONTHLONG OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD BUT SHIFTED IT FROM THE MEMBER ONE TO GENERATE THIRTY FIRST AND TO OCTOBER FIFTEENTH TWO JERRY FIFTEENTH. THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD ENDED ON JANUARY FIFTEENTH AND AS MENTIONED BY THE AUTHOR WE SAW TWENTY FOUR PER 24% DROP IN YOU ENROLLMENT WHICH FAR SURPASS THE AT THE FEDERAL MARKETPLACE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN COVER CALIFORNIA DELAYED MARKETING AND ADVERTISING UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER TO AVOID COMPETING WITH ELECTIONS CAMPAIGNS ADD. THIS EFFECTIVELY SHORTEN THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD BY THREE WEEKS AND EVERY YEAR COVER CALIFORNIA HAS ALSO HAS TO COMPETE WITH HOLIDAYS HE'S IN CAMPAIGNING. THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE CALIFORNIANS HAVE PLENTY OF TIME AFTER THE NEW YEAR BEGINS SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT CAUGHT COVERAGE OPTIONS AND ACTUALLY BUY INTO. A COVERAGE FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR I THINK YOU. LINDA TO HEAR WHAT'S ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK -- WE FIND THAT THIS EXTENSION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AS THIS IS TRULY AN ISSUE OF ACCESSIBILITY -- RECENT COVER CALIFORNIA DATA ON THEIR ENROLLMENT NUMBERS IS ACTUALLY REVEALED THAT THERE'S BEEN A DECREASE IN SPANISH AND KOREAN SPEAKING ENROLLEES SO THIS IS REALLY CONCERNING AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE COMMUNITIES AND ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY LEARN AND UNDERSTAND WHAT COVERAGE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THAT THEY CAN STAY AND ENROLL IN COVERAGE EASILY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

ANTHONY GLASSER WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION. WELL MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS WHICH I HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL. AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR STAFF IN THE SPONSOR FOR MEETING WITH US THE OTHER DAY. WE HAD A CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION AT LEAST ONE OPTION WAS THROWN OUT THERE THAT WERE -- YOU KNOW TING BACKS WHERE MEMBERS I THINK THE ISSUE FOR THE HEALTH PLANS -- MISTER MEMBERS IS THAT UNDER THIS BILL -- THOSE FOLKS THAT KIND OF HIT THE ENROLLMENT DEADLINE -- PER PER THE TENETS OF THIS BILL WOULDN'T START THEIR COVERAGE UNTIL MARCH FIRST AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT A FEBRUARY FIRST START TIME. AS YOU KNOW UNDER THE FEDERAL RULES IF WE ADOPTED THEM HERE THEY REVIEW JANUARY FIRST START FOR COVERAGE THAT MEANS MORE COVERAGE FOR CONSUMERS. FOR THE HEALTH PLANS IN TERMS OF PREMIUM DEVELOPMENT IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE A FULL YEAR OF OF OF RATES -- SO THAT WE CAN -- YOU KNOW BASE -- YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR'S RATES ON EXPERIENCE AND AND IN A FULL YEAR PREMIUM SUPPORT. SO -- THE GOOD THING ABOUT HAVING A BILL IS PERHAPS WE CAN SETTLE THIS AS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN HAVING A BILL EVERY YEAR AND IT'S KIND OUR OUR OUR OUR PLANS LIKE PREDICTABILITY I WHEN IT COMES TO COVER CALIFORNIA -- AND IMPLEMENTING THIS SCENE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET SO WE HOPE TO COME TO TERMS YOU KNOW OUR OUR OUR PRINCIPLE IS THAT CONSUMERS SHOULD HAVE -- A FULL YEAR OF COVERAGE OR CLOSE TO IT AND FOR MARKET STABILITY IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE A FULL YEAR OF PREMIUMS TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET FINANCIALLY SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE SAFE AND READY TO LEARN WAS OUR SECOND. WAS BIPARTISAN I'LL BE QUIET -- RESPECTFULLY ASK DR A AS AS YOU WISH YEAH ARE THERE OTHERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] PLEASE [inaudible] ABBREVIATED. ABOUT TWO MINUTES IS THAT RIGHT GO FOR THAT SOUNDS GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS TRACY MENDEZ AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED HEALTH ALLIANCE CSE TODAY'S BEEN A CO SPONSOR OF AB. THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO AND WE'VE BEEN BRINGING TOGETHER HEALTH AND EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. WE KNOW THERE'S A CRITICAL AND GROWING NEED I KNOW YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE YOU'RE READY TO MOVE FORWARD. FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CARE -- INTO MANY CASES -- SCHOOLS ARE THE ONLY PLACE WHERE CHILDREN CAN OR AT LEAST DO RECEIVE THE PRIMARY CARE NURSING DENTAL VISION AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL. WE'VE BEEN EXCITED BY THE TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN BOTH THE VOLUME AND VARIETY OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES OFFERED IN CALIFORNIA FOR NOW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. BUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEMSELVES AND ALSO BY THEIR LOCAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. HOWEVER IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION -- PARTNERS TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX TO REIGN OF THESE TWO DIFFERENT SECTORS -- I WILL SHORTEN MY STATEMENTS JUST TO SAY IT IS DIFFICULT AND WE KNOW THAT MANY STATES HAVE -- KIND OF RESOLVE THIS TENSION BY CREATING OFFICES OF SCHOOL HEALTH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO HELP NAVIGATE THE TERRITORY. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO WOULD ADD SIMILAR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE THINK WOULD BE VERY SUPPORTIVE TO SCHOOLS THEIR PARTNERS AND YOUTH AND IN WORKING THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT ISSUES -- I WILL CLOSE BY JUST RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING YOUR AYE VOTE WHICH ALREADY GIVEN. MR CHAIRED TONY TO BEAR ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I TO WILL TRYING AND BRIEF YET MY COMMENTS. THE SERGEANTS HANDING OUT A DOCUMENT THAT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE JUST PRODUCED -- LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY EIGHT OF THE FIFTY STATES AND SERVICES AND WE BILL LESS THAN 50%. FOR PREVENTATIVE CARE. LAST YEAR'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY BACK THIS YEAR. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO THEM BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES LASTLY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A. B.. THIRTY ONE NINETY TWO THE CREATES A PROGRAM UP PROGRAM GUIDE FOR DISTRICTS TO HOPEFULLY GET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT'S WHAT STUDENTS STUDENTS DEMAND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THIS YEAR WE WILL. REACH THE FINISH LINE TO GET A GOVERNOR'S THAT SIGNATURE ON THE CREATION OF AN OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH OTHERS TO SUPPORT.

SEE NUMBER BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISS MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. YOU KNOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THE REASON IT IS IRONIC THAT I JUST SPENT SOME TIME WITH SOME OF THE TEACHERS AND OF THE ISSUES OF THAT ARE JUST -- SNOWBALLING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND TO BE ABLE TO HELP SOME OF THESE THE HOSE STUDENTS HAVE SOME SOME KIND OF HEALTH CARE HEALTH SERVICES. I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO DRAG THE PARENTS IN ON SOME OF THESE BECAUSE THERE ARE CRISIS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR FAMILIES. SO THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS FOR THANK YOU. SO THE THE BILL ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISS -- CARILLO SECOND BY MISTER -- SO MUCH BY MR FLORA SECOND BY MISS CARILLO -- WHICH I TO CLOSE MISTER BERMAN I DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY COLLEAGUES I COME I COME IT'S INCREDIBLY SHORT BECAUSE OF THE EARLY BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BUT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL -- THAT WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO TO HEALTH SERVICES FOR A LOT OF STUDENTS AND DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS TO DO THAT SO I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE ALL YOUR ALL SUPPORT -- FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH BRING THE BILL FOR THINGS LIKE THAT MA'AM SECRETARY THE MOTION IS TO PASS. OF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES? MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY. I GET CREE AYE BIGELOW BONTA BURKE. BURKE I CARILLO CARILLO AYE FLORA FLOOR I LEVEL. LIMON AYE MCCARTY. NAZARIAN. NAZARIAN AYE RAMOS. PROBLEMS I RODRIGUEZ -- YES AYE SANTIAGO WALDRON. YOU HAVE TEN VOTES SAYS OF THE BILLS OUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH. SO OUR NEXT -- MISTER FLORA ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. WAS STARTUP ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAFF AND ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH WILL RESTORE. BUT IT COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE AL. AND MAKE AUTHORIZATIONS BILLING POLICY CONSENT. WITH THAT OF ANY POSITION PERFORMING THE SAME SERVICES AS YOU MAY KNOW BUDGET CUTS IN TWO THOUSAND I AM ELIMINATED PUT IT SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE. BECAUSE OF THIS PODIATRISTS ARE PROHIBITED FROM PREFER. PROVIDING SERVICES TO PATIENTS AUTOMATIC OUT UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. LIMITATIONS OF NOT HAVE LED TO A DELAY IN FOOT TREATMENT. MOST OFTEN RESULTING IN PATIENTS WAITING FOR WAIT UNTIL COMPLICATIONS ARE SO BAD THEY REQUIRES COSTLY ER VISITS. THESE RESTRICTIONS HAVE WILL WORSEN AN ALREADY CUTE ACCESS PROBLEM FOR LOW INCOME. THE DISABLED POPULATION STUDIES SHOW THAT BY OFFERING COVERAGE PROVIDERS CAN PREVENT COMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENTS. AND ACTUAL PROVIDE OVERALL SAVINGS. AB. SIX SEVENTY FOUR EIGHT AS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IT WOULD STREAMLINED POLICIES PROVIDE BETTER HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES FOR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. AS DR JOHN GRISHAM. GO AHEAD SIR CHAIRMAN WHAT NUMBERS THAT MANY THANK YOU. I'M JOHN CHISHOLM -- I'M JUST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE AFTER MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. I'M ALSO A PODIATRIST I'VE BEEN IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN CHULA VISTA CALIFORNIA FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS SERVING ONE OF THE MOST. MOST ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AND UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER. THIS POPULATION RELIES HEAVILY ON THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. AND FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVE SUFFERED FROM A LACK OF ACCESS TO QUALITY FOOT AND ANKLE CARE THEIR TWO REASONS FOR THIS THE FIRST IS THAT SERVICES VICE PODIATRIST HAVE NOT YET BEEN REINSTATED AND ALL HEALTH HEALTH CARE SETTING SETTINGS. AND SECOND PODIA TRICK SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO ONEROUS AND UNNECESSARY AUTHORIZATION BILLING AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS THAT FURTHER LIMIT ACCESS. WHEN PRIDE FREE SERVICES WERE LIMITED FOR MEDI CAL IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THIS ELIMINATION APPLY TO A TYPE OF PROVIDER BUT I INTEREST? BUT NOT THE SERVICES THEMSELVES. IN OTHER WORDS PRIDE FIRST THE SPECIALISTS AND PUT NICKEL CARE ARE PREVENTED FROM PROVIDING THE EXACT SAME SERVICES AS POSITIONS FOR MEDICAL PATIENTS. BUT POOL RESTORATION ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT ACCESS CURRENTLY SERVICES BY PODIATRISTS ARE SUBJECT TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF AUTHORIZATION BILLING AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS THAN POSITIONS AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE HANDOUT BEFORE YOU. AS A MEDICAL PROVIDER FOR PROVIDER FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER I CAN ATTEST TO THE DIFFICULTY INVOLVED IN TRYING TO MEET ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC OF DIABETES AND DIET BECAUSE DIABETES RELATED FOOT NICKEL DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA MY OWN COMMUNITY IS BEING PARTICULARLY DEVASTATED. DIABETIC FOOT ULCERATIONS IN TEMPTATIONS HAVE BEEN INCREASING STEADILY SINCE PROVIDE FREE SERVICES WERE ELIMINATED TEN YEARS AGO. THE PREVENTATIVE PUT CARE THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THESE ALTERATIONS NOT A COVERED BENEFIT. AND TREATING THE AUTHORIZATION LIKE ALL OF THE OPTIONAL SERVICES IS LIMITED TO VISITS PER MONTH I TREAT DIABETIC FOOT WOUNDS ALL DAY EVERY DAY IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE OR TWO VISITS A MONTH TO HEAL A DIABETIC FOOT INFECTION. A DIABETIC FOOT WOUND AS AN EMERGENCY LIFE THREATENING CONDITION THE MEDICAL PROVIDER MANUAL AGREES IN THIS PROCEDURE DOES NOT REQUIRE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR A POSITION. BUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED FOR ANY PROCEDURE OR TREATMENT BY A PODIATRIST REGARDLESS OF SEVERITY. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE TREATMENT OF THE INFECTION IS DELAYED OR NOT TREATED ADEQUATELY IT BECOMES LIFE THREATENING. PATIENT LOSES THEIR LAKE. THE SCENARIO I JUST PRESENTED IS TYPICAL IT'S PREVENTABLE AND IT'S WRONG. WE NOW HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE IT RIGHT PLEASE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. RENDON MARGIE WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT.

AB -- NINE SIXTY TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE START A THINKING THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR STAFF. FOR THE WORK ON THE BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. AB NINE SIXTY TO OUR CARS HOSPITALS WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES TO ANNUALLY DISCLOSE. IN A PUBLIC REPORT TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT THEIR GOALS AND EFFORTS IN REGARDS TO THEIR PROCUREMENT OF SUPPLIES. FROM WOMEN MINORITIES. WOMEN MINORITY LGBT A VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES EIGHTY NINE SIXTY TWO ALSO REQUIRES A REPORT TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH PROCUREMENTS ARE MADE FROM DIVERSE BUSINESSES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. EIGHTY NINE SIXTY TWO DOES NOT REQUIRE QUOTAS FOR A HOSPITAL'S PROCUREMENT POLICY IT MERELY REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PROCUREMENT PRACTICES. OUR STATE IS ONE IS ONE THAT TAKES PRIDE IN ITS DIVERSITY AND IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MARGINALIZED DIVERSE BUSINESSES PROVIDE NUMEROUS BENEFITS TO LOCAL ECONOMIES ACCORDING THE U. S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION STATE ARE. MINORITY OWNED FOR THE MORE DIVERSE BUSINESSES ARE MORE LIKELY TO OPERATE AS SMALL BUSINESS AND HIRE PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS PROVIDING A PATHWAY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY AND UPWARD MOBILITY FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. REQUIRING HOSPITALS TO BE TRANSPARENT IN THEIR PROCUREMENT EFFORTS AND PRACTICES AB NINE SIXTY TO ENSURE THAT OUR WOMEN MINORITY LGBT AND VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MORE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WITH THAT. I REQUEST BY FLEA REQUEST AN ANKLE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU SO MEMBER BURKE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. MY NAME IS ANTHONY GLASS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH EQUITY AT THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE WHERE STATEWIDE MULTIETHNIC POLICY ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT AB NINE SIXTY TWO BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL PROMOTE DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION BY REQUIRING HOSPITALS TO ANNUALLY DISCLOSE THEIR SUPPLIER DIVERSITY GOALS. AND THE OVERALL PROCUREMENT OF WITH THE BURST BUSINESSES OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. OUR STATE CURRENTLY LACKS THE THE DATA ABOUT WHETHER OR HOW HOSPITAL'S REFLECTING ENGAGE DIVERSE BUSINESSES IN THEIR PROCUREMENT PRACTICES. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION ALL WE CAN DO THE SPECTER SPECULATE ABOUT THE HEALTHCARE SECTORS ENGAGEMENT WITH DIVERSE BUSINESSES. EIGHTY NINE SIXTY TO ALLOW HEALTHCARE BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS TO ENGAGE IN AN ON IT HONEST AND TRANSPARENT DISCUSSION. ABOUT LEVERAGING THE GROWTH OF THE HEALTH SECTOR TO BENEFIT DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HOSPITALS CONTRIBUTED OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND TWENTY SIXTEEN FURTHERMORE. NUMEROUS EXAMPLES SUGGEST THAT SUPPLIER DIVERSITY EPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL LEAD TO INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES IN CAPITAL FOR DIVERSE BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE CPUC BEGAN TRACKING SUPPLIER DIVERSITY AMONG UTILITIES IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX DIVERSE BUSINESSES ONLY RECEIVED WO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRACTS. HOWEVER BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN UTILITIES PROCURED OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM DIVERSE SUPPLIERS. ADDITIONALLY WENT AFTER THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE BEGAN TRACKING SUPPLIER DIVERSITY IN TWENTY SIX AT TWENTY TWELVE CONTRACTING BETWEEN LARGE INSURERS AND DIVERSE BUSINESSES. INCREASED BY 90% FROM NINE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION. IN TWENTY TWELVE TO ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOSPITALS ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE MY PARTNER IN CONTRACTING WITH DIVERSE BUSINESSES. AS A RESULT OF AB NINE SIXTY TWO CALIFORNIA CAN LEVERAGE THE EXPANSION OF THE STATE'S HEALTH SECTOR TO BENEFIT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN LGBT PEOPLE AND VETERANS. SIMILAR TO PREVIOUSLY ENACTED SUPPLIER DIVERSITY LEGISLATION. OUR STATE WILL BENEFIT FROM GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND INCREASED BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVERSE BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU NOT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIVAL. VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. NO ONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. CATHERINE ALSO GOT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WHERE IMPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- POSITION [inaudible] WE I HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND I THINK THERE'S PLACES WHERE WE CAN AGREE HOSPITALS DON'T HAVE POLICIES RELATED TO SUPPLIER DIVERSITY. I THINK OUR STRUGGLE IS IS THAT WHEN WE LOOKED AT WHAT OUR SUPPLIERS WERE. 60% OF OUR SUPPLIERS ARE LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES LARGE G. PO'S THAT MAN THAT WE WORK WITH TO CREATE A LOWER PRICE ON BRANDED DRUGS. OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND OTHER MACHINERY AND EXCEPT FOR THAT'S IN OUR HOSPITALS AND ANOTHER 20% IS ON OUR A REGULARLY UTILIZED SUPPLIES LIKE TAPE EXCEPT FOR THESE ARE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES THAT -- I THINK ONLY A FEW [inaudible] VERY FEW. I'M TALKING MAYBE THE TWO LARGEST SYSTEMS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT IN CREATING MORE DIVERSITY IN THAT SPACE SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR DIVERSITY AND HOW WE CAN MAKE AN IMPACT IN OUR CHOICES WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THOSE SMALLER BUSINESS WHICH IS OUR UNFORTUNATELY AT A VERY SMALL NUMBER. SO I THINK WHERE WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR IS HOW CAN WE HELP LEVERAGE THOSE DOLLARS -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZE AND NOT PENALIZE OUR HOSPITALS IN THEIR REPORTING -- THAT THEY AREN'T GOING TO DIVERSE COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE PRICE RELATED TO THOSE GPO SO AGAIN. FOCUSED ON THAT HEALTH CARE PRICE. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. BIRTH CONNIE DELGADO ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP FORUM I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. WE DO YOU HAPPEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN YES I CAN JUST DO IN MY CLOTHES OKAY THAT'S FINE -- INDIA ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WOULD YOU LIKE YES US SO TO THE OPPOSITION YES WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT HISTORY HAS SHOWN WITH WITH BOTH THE PC AND OTHER AND OTHER REGULATORS THAT THAT. THIS SORT OF LEGISLATION DOES HELP TO CREATE MORE DIVERSITY AND WHETHER YOU AND THE BILL DOES SAY FOR THOSE WHO DO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REPORT -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK THAT DIVERSITY IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK WHATEVER PRESSURE WE PUT ON THE SYSTEM TO CREATE THAT KIND OF SUPPLIER DIVERSITY IS THINK IT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT THAT STATE AS THE CAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY REQUEST I WILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD IS DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- TO HAVE A MOTION.

AB [inaudible] TWENTY THREE TWENTY EIGHT NO. TEN THIRTY ONE YEAH PLEASE THAT WOULD BE BETTER. THANK YOU THE RIGHT. ONE AB TEN THIRTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE CONTINUUM OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE FOR YOUTH. UNDER AGE. TWENTY ONE THE BILL WOULD ALSO ENABLE COUNTY SAN PROVIDERS TO PROPERLY CLAIM AND BILL FOR T. P. S. T. D. ENTITLEMENT SERVICES UNDER DRUG MEDIC HELP BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT. OF ESTABLISH THE DEPARTMENT TO ESTABLISH BILLING CODES FOR COVERED A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES UNDER THE E. P. S. THE T. BENEFIT. SINCE THERE'S A FEDERAL MATCH FORTY P. S. T. T. THE ABILITY TO BILL FOR THE SERVICES WOULD DRIVE DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR YOUTH TREATMENT. FOR CONTEXT UP USE DISORDER DEVELOPED A PATTERN OF ALCOHOL OR DRUG DEPENDENCE BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN UNDER THE FEDERAL EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING AND TREATMENT BENEFIT. MEDICAID AND ROLLED YOU ARE ENTITLED TO AGE APPROPRIATE CARE FOR ANY IDENTIFIED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS HOWEVER MEDICAID SERVICE PAYMENTS ALONE ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE CAPITAL AND OVERHEAD COSTS NEEDED TO BUILD. NEW COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAS NOT CHOSEN TO INVEST IN A ROBUST SYSTEM OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE FOR UNINSURED AND MEDICAID ELIGIBLE YOUTH. WHILE COUNTIES MANAGE PUBLICLY FUNDED TREATMENT PROGRAMS THEY LACK SYSTEMATIC -- GUIDANCE AND DEDICATED FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF SERVICES FOR THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. ESTABLISHING STATEWIDE STANDARDS WILL BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR YOUTH TREATMENT PROGRAMS WITH ME AND SUPPORT OUR DOCTOR WILLIAM ARROYO FROM THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. AND TOM RENT FREE FROM THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS TOM RUN FREE WITH THE COUNTY BE ABLE HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN ADOLESCENCE I STRUGGLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. NEW DATAFROM THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL INDICATE THAT EVERY TWO DAYS A CALIFORNIA YOUTH DIES FROM AN OPIOID OVERDOSE. AND THAT -- THAT MORE YOUTH ARE BEING NOW TREATED IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON OPIOIDS THE NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED OVER 50%. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY AS AS THE AUTHOR IS SAID CALIFORNIA HAS NOT INVESTED IN A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF S. U. D. TREATMENT SERVICES FOR UNINSURED MEDICAID ELIGIBLE YOUTH. MOST EXISTING PUBLICLY FUNDED A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAMS -- IN THE STATE WERE DESIGNED TO SERVE THE ADULT POPULATION THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF YOUTH WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN AGE SPECIFIC TREATMENT SETTINGS. THAT OFFER A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE ARE WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS -- DOCTOR WILLIAM ROY AND I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION -- SKY ACTORS WHO PRACTICES IN LOS ANGELES AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH KIDS JUST LIKE THIS -- FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS -- IN A PROBATION FACILITY.

NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WE HAVE YET TO ESTABLISH A CONTINUUM OF CARE. WHICH WOULD RANGE FROM SUCH THINGS AS PREVENTIVE SERVICES. TO OUT PATIENT COUNSELING NOT ONLY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THE FAMILY THAT'S IMPACTED -- I SHOULD UNDER SCORED THE ADVERSE IMPACT THAT THESE VARIOUS SUBSTANCES HAVE ON BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. SO THAT THEY COMPROMISED ONLY THE STUDENTS EDUCATION BUT THE STUDENTS HEALTH AS AN ADULT. AND FRANKLY MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SIMPLY ADD TO THE INCREASED SEEN HOMELESS POPULATION OF THE STATE.

NETWORK LEASING ARRANGEMENTS PRESENT NUMEROUS PROBLEMS FOR THE DENTIST AND THEIR PATIENTS THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS DENTIST MAY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH MORE THAN ONE PLAN. WHICH MEANS THEY MAY BE A PROVIDER IN DIFFERENT NETWORKS. CURRENTLY THE PLANS THAT LEASE OR PURCHASE NETWORKS HAVE LIMITED RESPONSIBILITY TO BE TRANSPARENT AND SOME PORTANTINO WHICH FEE SCHEDULES ARE IN EFFECT FOR THEIR PATIENTS. DENNIS ARE SENSITIVE TO THE PRICE CONCERNS OUR PATIENTS HAVE AND THEY NEED THEIR THIS TRANSPARENCY TO BE ABLE TO CLEARLY DISCUSS TREATMENT OPTIONS AN OUT OF POCKET COSTS WITH THEM. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR EXAMPLE DENTAL PLANS TO GRANT THIRD PARTY ACCESS TO TO PROVIDER NETWORK SO THE PROVIDERS CLEARLY KNOW WHAT THAT THE CON. THAT THE CONTRACT GRANTS A THIRD PARTY ACCESS TO THE PROVIDER NETWORK. AND THAT I AS A PROVIDER HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THIRD PARTY ACCESS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. GIVE ME WITNESSES WITH YEAH I DO. YEAH BUT WHEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS HERE I WITH SEE THE CALIFORNIA DON'T ASSOCIATION AS A SPONSOR. OF THIS BILL -- AND I THINK IS A DOCTOR WOULD MENTION THAT THERE'S OBSERVE A GROWING TREND OF LEASING AND DENTAL PLANS AND WHAT CAN BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH THE PLANS AND THE DENNIS. THERE ARE PROBLEMS THAT ARISE WHEN THERE'S NOT TRANSPARENCY THEY'RE OFTEN DENNIS TO DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN LEASED OR THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT PLANS THEY'VE BEEN LEASED TO OR THEY DON'T KNOW THE TERMS OF THOSE CONTRACTS. THIS CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR PATIENTS WHEN THE DENTIST -- CAN'T EXPLAIN TO A PATIENT WHAT THEIR PLAN IS GOING TO COVER SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THINGS LIKE -- THAT LIMITATIONS ON SERVICES WAITING PERIODS EVEN THINGS LIKE HOW I SERVICES CLASSIFIED AS AN A MAJOR SERVICE OR MINOR SERVICE CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT WHICH ARE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO BE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN THEIR TREATMENT PLANNING -- REALLY THIS BILL JUST ABOUT TRANSPARENCY ENSURING THAT DENTISTS AND KNOW WHAT PLANS ARE IN THAT THEY KNOW THE TERMS OF THOSE CONTRACTS AND THAT THEY CAN OPT OUT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE. WE HAVE BEEN I'M PLEASED TO WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF DENTAL PLANS ON SOME TECHNICAL CONCERNS WE ARE AWARE THAT THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE -- RAISE SOME CONCERNS AS WELL THERE ISSUES SEEM TO BE -- DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OF THE DENTAL PLANS AND SO WE ASK THEM TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DENTAL PLANS AND THEN -- WILL OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE HAVING CONVERSATIONS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD -- DRIVER. CHRISTY WE SOME PERHAPS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF DENTAL PLANS AS BRIANNA SAID WE'VE BEEN IN. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR AND THE DENTAL PLAN SUPPORT THE INTENTION OF THE BILL AND AND CD IS GOAL TO ENSURE THAT DENNIS FULLY UNDERSTAND -- THE PARAMETERS OF THE NETWORK CONTRACTS THAT THEY'VE ENTERED INTO SO WE DO HAVE A FEW MORE OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT WERE STILL WORKING THROUGH BUT WE ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS AND WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET THERE. THANK YOU. CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT A TURN MEMBERS COUNTY MUST WORK WITH DELTA DENTAL CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. RENDON MARGIE WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT.

MY PLEASURE PRESENT AB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED AB SEVENTY TWO WAS WHICH RESULTED IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS. WHEN THEY RECEIVE CARE FROM A FACILITY THAT WAS IN THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE'S OF NET WILL HAVE HEALTHCARE PLANS NETWORK? AS ONE OF THE KEY NEGOTIATORS THAT BILL WE MADE SOME TOUGH CHOICES WITH POTENTIAL IMPACTS FOR MANY STAKEHOLDERS. FOR EXAMPLE WE PUT IN PLACE A RATE FOR THE OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE CONTRACTING WITH THOSE PROVIDERS. THEY PROMISED TO FOLLOW THE NEW CLOSELY FOR AND I'VE AND I PROMISED TO PAUL THE NEW LAW CLOSELY FOR ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. SINCE THEN ONE OF THE CLAIMS HAS BEEN THAT THESE RATES HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED EXISTING CONTRACTS AND HEALTH PLANS ARE USING THEM TO GAIN AN UPPER HAND IN CONTRACTING. IT'S IMPORTANT DETAIL HEALTH PLAN ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN ADEQUATE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS FOR THEIR ENROLLEES. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FACILITY BASED ANESTHESIOLOGISTS HEALTH PLANS INSURERS HEALTH THE CITY'S BASILIDES AND HEALTH PLAN ENROLLEES ARE COMPLEX. AND THIS BILL ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS BY REQUIRING UPON A TERMINATION OF IN ANESTHESIOLOGY CONTRACT. THAT HEALTH PLAN HAS A CONTRACT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT ENROLLEES AND INSURERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF PROVIDERS WHEN THEY RECEIVE CARE A CONTRACTED FACILITIES. WITH THAT I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PRICE DOUGHERTY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS THE PHYSICIAN ANESTHESIOLOGISTS AND STATE. WE'RE PROUD SPONSORS OF THE BILL -- WE ALL ARE AWARE OF AB SEVENTY TWO IMPORTANCE OF GETTING PATIENTS OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF CONTRACT DISPUTES BETWEEN. PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS -- THOSE PROVISIONS OF AB SEVENTY TWO WERE A LONG TIME COMING WHAT WE'VE NOTICED WITH REGARDS TO THAT BILL LITERALLY MONTHS AFTER. A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER THE BILL WAS SIGNED WE'VE NOTICED THAT A LOT OF HEALTH PLANS WERE -- ISSUING TERMINATION NOTICES WITH REGARDS TO ANASTASIA SERVICES -- IN ADDITION WHAT MR WOOD SAID IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KIND OF INFORM THE COMMITTEE WHAT THE BILL DOESN'T DO. YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD IN YOU MAY HEAR THAT -- THE BILL IS INCREASED COSTS THIS BILL DOES NOT INCREASE COST. THE BILL DOES NOT FORCE PLAYERS INTO A SIGNING CONTRACTS BAD CONTRAST WITHIN ITS TEACHER PROVIDERS. THE BILL. DOES NOT APPLY TO PROVIDER TERMINATED CONTRACTS USER THESE ARE CONTRACTED OR TERMINATED BY THE PAIR OR BY THEIR DELEGATED ENTITY -- NUMEROUS EXAMPLES ALL AROUND THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE GOT LARGE ANASTASIA GROUPS IN ORANGE COUNTY. HUNDRED AND% THIRTY PHYSICIAN GROUP COVERING A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND LIVES. IN SIX HOSPITALS AND THIRTY ONE SURGERY CENTERS WHO HAD LEGACY CONTRACTS WITH PAYERS FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS. AND ARE NOW RECEIVING TERMINATION NOTICES -- IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT COMPLEX TRANSACTION ANASTASIA SERVICES ARE UNIQUE -- IT IS A CRITICAL POINT OF HAVING SURGERY -- AND MANAGING YOUR PAIN -- SO AT THE SAME TIME. MEDICARE AS A METHODOLOGY REIMBURSEMENT ONLY PAYS ABOUT CONTRACTED RATE FRAME THIS TEACHER SERVICES IS IN CALIFORNIA -- FOR THOSE REASONS AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE -- DOCTOR JEFFREY POGUE WHO IS A PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIOLOGISTS AND CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE IMPACTS AFFAIRS DIVISION. FOR THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS THANK YOU. BUT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BRANDON MARGIE WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -- ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE US GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE AND MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR ANESTHESIOLOGY ARE PRACTICALLY 67% LOWER THAN COMMERCIAL RATES. AND DO THIS PRICE DIFFERENTIAL ANESTHESIA PROVIDERS ARE UNIQUELY IMPACTED BY THAT PAYMENT STANDARD IN AB SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS TIED. IN PART TO A 125% OF THE MEDICARE RIGHT. IN THE WAKE OF AB SEVENTY TWOS PASSAGE CMA RECEIVE NUMEROUS REPORTS FROM ANESTHESIOLOGY PRACTICES ABOUT PAYERS USING THE DEFAULT PAYMENT STANDARD IN AB. SEVENTY TWO AS A WEAPON. FOR EXAMPLE TERMINATION NOTICES ANTHRAX BY PAYERS TO TERMINATE EXISTING CONTRACTS IF PHYSICIAN GROUP IF THE PHYSICIAN GROUP THEY'LL TO RENEGOTIATE LONGSTANDING CONTRACTS AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATES. IN SOME CASES IN EXCESS OF 30% LOWER. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR AND IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT FURTHER DETERIORATION OF EXISTING PROVIDER NETWORKS. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE REPAIRS TO CONTRACT WITH NEW POSITIONS AND IT DOES NOT CREATE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PHYSICIANS TO DEMAND HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES ON EXISTING CONTRACTS BECAUSE IT IS NOT TRIGGERED WHEN A PHYSICIAN INITIATES THE TERMINATION. THE BILL REQUIRES. A PAIR TO DEMONSTRATE SOME MINIMUM LEVEL OF PATIENT ACCESS TO IN NETWORK ANESTHESIA PROVIDERS AT IN NETWORK FACILITIES IF THE PAIR INTENDS TO TERMINATE AN EXISTING CONTRACT. AS AB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL BE VERY LIMITED IN ITS APPLICATION IT REPRESENTS A TARGETED SOLUTION TO A SPECIFIC PROBLEM. FACING ANESTHESIOLOGY PRACTICE WHICH IS NOT ADDRESS WILL RESULT IN REDUCE ACCESS TO HOSPITAL BASIC ANESTHESIA SERVICES. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. FOLKS ARE. IN -- CHAPO GOOD AGAIN IN PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIOLOGIST IN EAST BAY -- PART OF A GROUP OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PHYSICIAN ANESTHESIOLOGISTS AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON ON THIS BUILDING THIS THIS BILL IT. DRESSES SEVERAL ISSUES OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE OVER SIX THOUSAND ANESTHESIOLOGISTS. PRACTICING IN THIS GREAT STATE. AND WE APPRECIATE THE THE CHAIRS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT NOW GOING TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. KAREN KIRK FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURSE ANESTHETISTS PRACTICE DIRECTOR IN SUPPORT. GREAT ANY MORE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE IT WILL MOVE TO A WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BETH EL ON BEHALF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT OPPOSED IN LESS AMENDED POSITION OR CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS -- WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE ASSEMBLY BILL -- ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR FIRST WE WANT TO SAY WE DID -- YOU KNOW HAVE A GOOD MEETING WITH -- THE CHAIR ON THIS BILL WE WERE ALLOWED TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS -- AND WE'RE ALWAYS. WILLING TO STAND WITH THEM YOU KNOW WHEN HE TAKES ON HI HEALTHCARE COSTS AND AND LEGISLATION -- TO FIX MARKET MANIPULATION AND AND THE LIGHT. YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE IN THE SOLUTION OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL -- WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY INTERFERES WITH A CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PLANS IN ANESTHESIOLOGISTS. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WE'VE YOU -- AS BEING ONE SIDED ON WORKABLE AND WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE FOR CONSUMERS. HEALTH PLANS ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO NECESSARY SERVICES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AB SEVENTY TWO STATUES EXPRESSLY OBLIGATE THAT PLAN SATISFY THEIR NETWORK OUT OF WITH CITY ADEQUACY OBLIGATIONS EXCUSE ME -- THERE FOR THE NEW STANDARDS PROPOSED BY AB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR AT LITTLE IF ANY VALUE. AND INSTEAD ADD NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON THE PLANS WITH THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF MANDATING DIRECT CONTRACTS BETWEEN TWO PARTIES -- AB -- ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR NOT ONLY -- INTERFERES IN THOSE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PLANTS AND HONESTY. ANESTHESIOLOGISTS IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT FAVORS ONE PARTY -- OVER THE OTHER THE BILL'S PROVISIONS APPLY WHEN HEALTH PLANS INITIATE CONTRACT TERMINATIONS WITH ANESTHESIOLOGISTS. NO PROVIDERS RENEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF THEIR CONTRACTS AS WELL -- THEY CAN AND THEY DO DEMAND HIGHER RATES FROM HEALTH PLANS -- BY WAY OF EXAMPLE SEVERAL DOMINANT ANESTHESIOLOGIST GROUPS HAVE RECENTLY TERMINATED THEIR PROVIDER AGREEMENTS WITH MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. IN OUR INSTEAD DEMANDING TO BE PAID AT FULL. OF FULL BILL CHARGES OR NEAR THAT -- IN THE TAKING AT LEAST ONE OF MY PLANS -- IF NOT MORE OF THEM TO COURT OVER THIS ISSUE I KNOW WHEN A MAN WAS TAKEN OUT TO APPLY TO MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE BUT I YOU KNOW I OFFER THAT AS A AS AN EXAMPLE. OF THE FACT THAT THE PROVIDER SIDE IS QUITE CAPABLE OF IT BEING GAUGING AN AGGRESSIVE NEGOTIATING TACTICS HOWEVER THIS BILL PLACES ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY ON PROVIDERS IF AND WHEN THEY ARE TERMINATING THEIR CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH PLANS -- MEMBERS MANY HOSPITAL BASED PROVIDERS SUCH AS ANESTHESIOLOGISTS ARE WELL KNOWN FOR NOT CONTRACTING WITH PLANS AND SUCH BUT AND AND THEREFORE BILLING PLANS IN CONSUMERS -- OUTRAGEOUS OUT OF NETWORK CHARGES IN SURPRISE BILLS -- ONE RECENT REPORT -- PLACE THOSE OUT OF NETWORK CHARGES -- AS AS HIGH AS 11100% OF MEDICARE -- THE LEGISLATURE ARE OF COURSE HAS BEEN WIDELY CRACKING DOWN ON THAT -- WE UNFORTUNATELY VIEW THIS IS A STEP BACKWARDS -- ONE FINAL NOTE -- MEMBERS OF THIS BILL SUBJECT MY MEMBERS TO FINES AND PENALTIES EVEN WHEN IT'S THE PLANS DELEGATED ENTITIES NOT THE PLAN ITSELF THEY'RE IN VIOLATION OF THE BILL'S PROVISIONS -- THE BILL CREATES A SUB ACCOUNT WITHIN THE MANAGED CARE ADMINISTRATIVE FINES AND PENALTIES FUND FOR USE BY THE LEGISLATURE -- IT'S AN ENTIRELY NEW SUB ACCOUNT -- IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE USING. MONIES FROM THIS ACCOUNT FOR PURPOSES THAT WE THAT THAT ARE ILL DEFINED -- AT THIS TIME SO -- WE JUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL AND ASK YOU TO VOTE NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. STEPHANIE WATKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES TO HEAR TODAY IN OPPOSITION WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR SITTING DOWN WITH US AND HAVING A VERY. ACTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR CONCERNS THAT BEING SAID I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT -- FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVED THROUGH FIRST AB THIRTY FIVE THIRTY THREE IN AB SEVENTY TWO KIND OF NEGOTIATIONS. WHAT WE REALLY TRY TO DO IS CRAFT SOMETHING THAT WAS BOTH BALANCED WHERE PLANS AND PROVIDERS BOTH HAD A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT A FAIR AND APPROPRIATE RATE OF REIMBURSEMENT WAS ENTERED INTO? WHILE KEEPING THOSE CONSUMERS OUT OF THE MIDDLE AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DO SEE THIS BILL TODAY AS A WAY THAT SORT OF PUSHES THAT PENDULUM AND THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS THE PROVIDER GROUP. AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT ON THE CD I SIDE WE DO HAVE ROBUST NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS WOULD DO MAKE US FILE EVERY TIME THERE IS A IF THERE IS A POTENTIAL TERMINATION OF A CONTRACT TEN DAYS PRIOR. TO WE HAVE TO DO A SPECIFIC REPORT TO CDI ABOUT ANY MATERIAL MODIFICATION BASED ON HOSPITAL BASED POSITION SPECIFICALLY ANESTHESIOLOGIST. AND ANY CORRECTIVE PLAN RELATED TO ANY TERMINATIONS ARE NETWORK CONCERNS SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS THAT CAN BE SEEK. TO BY THE PROVIDER IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THE PLAN IS NOT FAIRLY REIMBURSING THEM WE THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE A GREAT. AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO SHOW WHEN THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT NETWORK ADEQUACY WE REALLY THINK THAT THAT IS THE BETTER VENUE. FOR THIS KIND OF DISPUTE BETWEEN TWO LARGER PARTIES TO BE TAKEN TO THE REGULATOR IF THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT THE ADEQUATE NETWORK. THE NOT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND NOT NECESSARILY THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT FOR HOSPITAL BASED POSITIONS OFTENTIMES THE INSURER HAS NO CONTROLLER WHOSE ACTUALLY ASSIGNED THE DAY I HAVE A PROCEDURE. THAT SOLELY BASED WITH THE HOSPITAL AND SO OFTEN TIMES YOU COULD HAVE AND A VERY WIDE BREADTH OF THE NETWORK BUT YOU COULD HAVE SOMEONE SHOW UP ONE DAY HEY AND THE HOSPITAL ASSIGN SOMEONE WHO HAPPENS TO NOT BE THE SAME AS THAT INSURED POLICY. AND THEREFORE YOU END UP WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT THEY'VE GONE TO AN IN NETWORK FACILITY HAD AN IN NETWORK DOCTOR AND HAD A SPECIALIST OR SOMEONE ELSE SHOW UP A PATH BIOLOGIST RADIOLOGIST THAT DAY. THAT PERSON HAPPENS TO BE OUT OF NETWORK THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE NETWORK ISN'T ADEQUATE IT JUST MEANS THAT WE WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE CONTROL BECAUSE HOSPITALS CAN'T EMPLOYEE POSITIONS. TO CONTROL WHO'S ASSIGNED THE DATE OF TO A PATIENT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE DO LOOK FOR IT THOUGH TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION AT THE BILL DOES MOVE FORWARD TODAY. THANK YOU. GREAT MANY OF THE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YEAH JOHN WINGER ON THE OF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WITH ECHO THE COMMENTS OF CAP AND ACT LIKE AND THEN JUST. ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION ON THE PROPONENTS TESTIMONY THEY SAID THE BENCHMARK RATE IS A OF MEDICARE FOR THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE WHICHEVER IS HIGHER SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE CLARIFIED. SEE NO FURTHER A WIN IS AN OPPOSITIONAL BRING BACK A TO MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. I GET CREE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD FOR FROM BRING THIS FOR I'M SUPPORT OF THE BILL I DO HAVE A CONCERN -- THAT THE BILL REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH ANESTHESIOLOGY JUST REGARDLESS OF THE COST. SO -- AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO REDUCE OUR COSTS FOR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OVERALL BECAUSE ME A LITTLE BIT OF A SO -- I AGREE THAT IT IS WRONG FOR PLANS TO UNFAIRLY AN INAPPROPRIATELY TERMINATE EXISTING CONTRACTS BUT I HESITATE TO SWING THE PENDULUM TOO FAR. THE OBVIOUS WAY -- I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY AND I'M SURE YOU CAN STILL WORK WITH EVERYBODY -- BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING FORWARD. I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE CONCERN AND I AND I I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE IS IS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE -- I THINK THAT -- I NEVER I NEVER ENVISIONED -- I WORKED CLOSELY WITH MR BONTA ON THIS BILL FOR WELL OVER A YEAR AB SEVENTY TWO WE NEVER ENVISIONED. THAT -- AT THE EXISTING CONTRACTS WOULD THEN BE SLASHED TO TO MUCH MUCH LOWER LEVELS WE ANTICIPATED -- FUTURE CONTRACTS NOT RISING AS FAST TO TO TO CURTAIL THE RISING COSTS WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT THAT SOME PLANTS NOT ALL BUT SOME PLANS WOULD USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TO SLASH REIMBURSEMENT ON ON IN MANY CASES -- CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR EVERGREEN CONTACTS FOR DECADES. SO -- SO I AM TRUST ME I AM AS YOU KNOW VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HEALTHCARE COSTS AND AND AND AND PROVIDER NETWORKS AND SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THIS I RECOGNIZE THIS DIFFICULT. IT'S A CLOCK IN THE PENDULUM SWINGING BACK AND FORTH EVENTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO GET IT TO STOP IN THE RIGHT PLACE -- AND I THINK WE'RE GETTING CLOSER THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. CITAT. DOCTOR WOULD JUST LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS I'M HERE BUT THIS IS FROM HEALTH ACCESS -- IT SAYS THAT -- AB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR DRIES UP HEALTH CARE COSTS BY REQUIRING HEALTH PLANS A AT ANY COST A RECENT NATIONAL DATA SHOWS THAT SOME ANESTHESIOLOGIST CHARGE MORE THAN NINE AND A PERCENT OF MEDICARE AND THE AVERAGE CHARGES THIS LEGISLATION WOULD ALLOW ANESTHESIOLOGIST TO DEMAND TO BE PAID A RATE IN EXCESS OF MATTER PERCENT OF MEDICARE. AND SO JUST WANT TO MAP WHEN PEOPLE WRITE STUFF ALL THE TIME BUT THE CONCERN I HAVE IS ACTUALLY THE SAME IS -- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. IN THAT. IN HEALTH CARE. IT IS NOT A COMPETITIVE IT IS NOT A FREE MARKET SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE A WILLING BUYER AND A WILLING SO SELLER. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ROLE OF PRICES THAT TO DECIDE WHAT'S WHAT'S THERE THERE ARE THIRD PARTY. PAYERS AND YOU'VE GOT A PROVIDER THAT IS DEMANDING A CERTAIN LEVEL. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BAD HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE -- THAT -- ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT EQUATION THAT WERE NOT GET THE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT INCREASING COSTS OF WHAT IN THIS BILL ACTUALLY ADDRESSES THAT. WHAT'S IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK I THINK WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL HAVING SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT AS I SAID EARLIER THE INTENTION WAS NOT. FOR PLAN TO SAY OKAY WE'RE WE'RE GONNA DRIVE YOUR CONTRACT DOWN AND THAT HAPPENED IN ONE CASE I BELIEVE 45% YOU ANYMORE -- BECAUSE OF WOLF WILL FIND ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT -- AND I COULD YOU KNOW DOCTOR POPE MIGHT BE ABLE TO OR OR MISTER DOCTOR MIGHT BE ABLE TO TO ELABORATE ON THAT. BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THEY'RE THERE LOOK MY INTENTION IS NOT TO DRIVE THE COST CARE A MY INTENTION WAS TO FLATTEN THE COURAGE AND KEEP IT TO A LOWER. BUT BUT I NEVER INTENDED BUT WE NEVER I WAS NOT MY INTENT TO DRIVE THE COST DOWN TO DRIVE THESE EXISTING CONTRACTS DOWN AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN SOME OF THESE CASES -- WHICH IS MADE DIFFICULT FOR SOME PROVIDERS SO I GUESS MAYBE I MAKE IN YOU AND I'VE WE'VE HAD LOTS OF THESE CONVERSATION WE HAVE A LOT OF AND SO WHAT ABOUT THIS BILL -- THE PROVIDES THAT THAT THAT BALANCE MAYBE YOU CAN -- YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT YET I THANK YOU MISTER MAYES PRESTAR GRAHAM ON BEHALF OF CSA I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT. AB SEVENTY TWO THE INTENT WAS TWO FOLD ONE WAS TO TAKE THE PATIENT ON A MIDDLE THESE CONTRACT DISPUTES THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR WAY TOO LONG. THE SECOND PURPOSE OF AB SEVENTY TWO BY SETTING UP AN INTERIM PAYMENT RATE WHICH OPPOSITION IS CORRECT IT THE INTERIM PAYMENT RATE IF YOU CAN'T IF YOU HAVE TO GO OUT OF NETWORK. AND YOUR PROVIDING SERVICES AT A CONTRACTED IN NETWORK FACILITY. THE INTRA RATE IS UP THE HIGHER AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE GIVEN THE THE FORMULA THAT WE HAVE FOR MEDI CAL FOR ANASTASIA SERVICES. UNDER 25% IS NEVER GOING TO WORK IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE PARLAYED TO THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE AND AND MISTER BONTA WE'RE GLAD THAT THOSE PROVISIONS WERE INCLUDED. THE INTENT OF AB SEVENTY TWO WAS NEVER. TO DRIVE DOWN HEALTHCARE COSTS PER SE ALL THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES WE'RE NOT WE'RE WE INTENTIONALLY. WENT AWAY FROM ANYTHING RELATED TO RATES AND CONTRACTS AND PERCENTAGES OF THIS ALL THIS BILL BASICALLY SAYS. IS THAT IF YOU'RE A HEALTH PLAN ENSURE THEIR DELEGATED ENTITY AND THERE IS A PLAN OR DELEGATED ENTITY AND NISHIDA TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT. YOU JUST HAVE TO PROVE TO YOUR REGULATOR THAT YOU HAVE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK OF ANASTASIA SERVICES AT THAT CONTRACTED FACILITY. SO THIS DOES NOTHING TO FORCE A HEALTH PLAN TO CONTRACT WITH THE NAME IS DJ GROUP ALL IT BASICALLY DOES IS TO SAY. THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES IN THIS IN THE STATE WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN NO WAY AS DCL JUST ON STAFF. THE DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE HAS QUESTION AND OPEN UP ALLEGATIONS IN A CASE AGAINST -- ANTHEM BLUE CROSS IN THE COUNTIES OF SAN DIEGO ORANGE SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES BECAUSE THERE WERE NO ANESTHESIA ANESTHESIA PROVIDERS ON STAFF BECAUSE THE TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS SO WE INTENTIONALLY AVOIDING THAT THE COST. AND AND OUT OF THE MONETARY POINTS ALL WE'RE SAYING IS YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PROCEDURES THAT GET DONE. IN A HOSPITAL DOCTOR POKING TALK TO THAT BETTER THAN I THAT REQUIRE HERE IN SD JUST SERVICES IS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT PART OF A HOW DO YOU GUARD AGAINST MANIPULATION. I'M SORRY HOW DO YOU GUARD AGAINST MANIPULATION WITH THAT. HOUSING THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS THERE'S ANOTHER INSTANCE WHICH I WANT TO TALK ABOUT REGARDS TO ANOTHER -- ANOTHER ANOTHER TYPE OF PROVIDERS WHERE THIS THE QUESTION HAD COME UP IN PART OF THE REASON WHY THERE'S BEEN MANIPULATION IS BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THIS NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT PARTICULAR WORK AND SO. THIS DID DID THESE PROVIDERS HAVE GAME THE SYSTEM AND SO HOW DO YOU WITH WITH THIS BILL AND HOW DO YOU AND YOU GUARD GETS MANIPULATION BECAUSE IT WILL HAPPEN I MEAN HUMAN NATURE TELLS US THAT. YEAH YOU YOU MANAGER TELLS US WE'RE GONNA ACT OUR OWN BEST INTEREST RIGHT SO I THINK I THINK I COULDN'T SAY IT ANY BETTER THAN DOCTOR WOULD WHICH IS WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A BALANCE AND THIS ISSUE ABOUT A NETWORK SERVICES AND SURPRISE BILLS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE IN. THIS BUILDING FOR FORTY PLUS YEARS AND WHEN WE WHEN WE DID AB SEVENTY TWO WE REALIZED THAT WAS A SOLUTION FOR A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. OKAY IT'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT THAN WHEN WE STARTED INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE. THERE'S THERE IS AN EQUILIBRIUM OVER TIME THE KIND OF HAPPENS AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS -- SITUATIONS WHERE PATIENTS IN AND CONTRACTED FACILITIES. DO NOT AND POTENTIALLY WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANASTASIA SERVICES SO IT IS KIND OF A BALANCING ACT THE PENDULUM SWINGS BOTH WAYS BUT IN THESE INSTANCES. YOU KNOW MOMENTS AFTER THAT BILL WAS SIGNED WE'VE STARTED TO SEE TERMINATION NOTICES FOR ANESTHESIA SERVICES AND JUSTIFY SO YOUR HEAD SHAKING OF HEADS ONE MAKE SURE THAT. IF YOUR ADDRESS SOMETHING WELL I I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED ANY I THINK THE TENANTS OF THE LETTER THAT YOU. READ OFFERED ARE LARGELY CRACKED -- THE BILL SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE. MUST TO MAKE A FINDING. THAT THEY HEALTH PLAN HOUSE DEMAND IS MANDATED BASICALLY -- TO IT TO DIRECT CONTRACTS. IT'S UNCLEAR WITH OBSCENITIES YELLED AS GROUPS ARE ANESTHESIOLOGISTS INDIVIDUALS. THE POINT IS IS THAT THESE EUROPE YOU'RE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE CONTRACT -- EIGHT THANK YOU ASPECTS OF FIVE BY THE BILL BY LAW. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROVIDER CLASS THAT IS IS PRETTY NOTORIOUS FOR ASKING -- FOR BILL CHARGERS THAT OUR WAY IN EXCESS OF THE MEDICARE RATE -- AND SO YOU KNOW IF IF AND WE HAVE NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS ON OUR BACK SO I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALL YOU CAN JUST ENVISION THE SITUATION THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ASKING FOR I MEAN YOU KNOW. I'M NOT A PARTY'S CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS BUT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASKING FOR ONE TWENTY FIVE MEDICARE OR THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATES WHEN WERE COMPELLED TO MAINTAIN DIRECT CONTRACTS WITH ANESTHESIOLOGISTS. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SO I JUST YOU KNOW WE'VE YOU THIS IS A COST FOR EVER. ONE ONE CHANCE RESPOND YOU KNOW SURE I THINK WHEN IN DOUBT READ THE BILL RIGHT SO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL STATE THAT. UPON RECEIVING NOTIFICATION. THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVE NOTIFICATION THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ISSUE A FINDING THAT THE EXPIRATION OR HELP. THAT THE EXPIRATION OR HEALTH CARE SERVICES PLAN INITIATED TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT WITH THE HEALTHCARE SERVICE PLAN SO I HAVE A IN PLACE. CONTRACTS WITH INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE LICENSED BY THE STATE TO LIVER REFRESH ANASTASIA SERVICES SO BOTH. SO SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED SO IT IT DOESN'T DO IT DOES WHAT THE WORD SAY IT DOES IT JUST THEY HAVE TO MAKE A FINDING THAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO TERMINATE A CONTRACT. THAT THERE ARE THERE IS AN ADEQUATE NETWORK OF ANESTHESIA PROVIDERS THE PROVIDE SERVICES IN THAT CONTRACTED HOSPITAL. WHAT THE BILL SAYS? OKAY ANYTHING FURTHER FROM ANY THE MEMBERS. I'LL JUST SAY THAT I STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS HOUSE -- UNDERSTAND DOCTOR WOODS -- INTENT WITH THIS WE ACTUALLY AGREE ON ON THE INTENT BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ACTUALLY HAVE BIG GETTING THEIR HOUSE WILL BE -- NOT VOTING ON THIS -- TODAY HOPEFULLY CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING -- WITH THAT IF THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER -- THAN OTHERS HAVE BEEN IN MOTION. I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. I'M SORRY. NO NO OF COURSE AT A MISTER BONTA [inaudible] M.. I WANT TO THANK DOCTOR WHAT FOR FREE LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE -- I THINK THERE IS. A LOT OF CONSENSUS AND A LOT OF DISCUSSION A LOT A LOT OF YOUR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN ON REDUCING THE COSTS OF OF OF HEALTH CARE SO -- I KNOW YOU'LL DO THIS BUT I I JUST WANTED TO REINFORCE BECAUSE I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TALK TO FOLKS LIKE HEALTH ACCESS IN THE PLANS TO TRY. TO KEEP COSTS DOWN AS WE MAKE SURE THERE'S ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE SERVICES FOR OUR PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THE USER BONTA AND DO ON A TEN MOTION -- MOTION BY BURKE SECOND BY MCCARTY SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AND I MOTIONS PASSED REYES I'M SORRY. I SKIPPED OVER THAT DOCTOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH. I'M JUST LIKE SAY LOOK. HEALTHCARE IS COMPLICATED -- IT IS AND AND THE NEGOTIATIONS ON AB SEVENTY TWO WERE WELL OVER A YEAR -- AS A GOOD ESSENTIALLY STARTED WHEN WHEN AB FIVE THIRTY THREE DIDN'T PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND THE PENDULUM LIKE I SAID DOES SWING SWING BOTH WAYS -- THE THE GOAL HERE IS IS TO CREATE SOME STABILITY AND IN THE MARKET PLACE AND THE GOAL IS NOT TO HAVE. PARTIES NOT WANT TO CONTRACT WE WANT PEOPLE TO CONTRACT WHAT THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST A CONTRACT AND WHAT THE HEALTH PLANS A CONTRACT WE WANT THEM BOTH TO DO IT FAIRLY -- LOOK I PRACTICED DENTISTRY FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS -- HAD CONTRACTS WITH DENTAL INSURANCE PLANS ONE IN PARTICULAR I HAD FOR TEN YEARS. I NEVER GOT AN INCREASE IN THE RATE I CHARGED. IN TEN YEARS. IS THAT FAIR. MY COSTS WENT UP. THE COSTA BINA A SOFT DRINK WENT UP THE COST OF BUYING BREAD WENT OUT BUT MIKE I'VE I WAS NEVER ABLE TO NEGOTIATE. AN INCREASE FOR THAT WHILE WHILE COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE IS THAT FAIR. THE ONLY OPTION I HAD WAS TO TO NO LONGER CONTRACT WITH THAT WITH THAT PLAN WHICH I ULTIMATELY CHOSE NOT TO CHOSE TO DO. WHICH MEANT THE SOME MY PATIENTS WERE ABLE TO GET CARE THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR PLAN IT WAS NOT A DECISION. I ARRIVED AT LIGHTLY. I AM VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE IDEA THAT WE NEED TO CONTAIN COSTS I ABSOLUTELY AM BUT I'M ALSO CONSCIOUS THAT PEOPLE NEED THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR PRACTICES. AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE AND WHEN THE YOU HAVE ESSENTIALLY FLAT CONTRACTING FOR THE THE PREMISES TO REDUCE THAT -- NOW YOU POTENTIALLY HAVE ADDITIONAL ACCESS PROBLEMS AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AB. THANKS THANK YOU DOCTOR WITH THAT WAS A GOOD CLOSE -- SECOND IT IS COLOR ALL. WHAT I WOULD I'D MAYES NOT PUT MAYES NOT VOTING AGUIAR-CURRY? THANK A CURRY I BIGELOW.
