SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS -- AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS SINCE WE RE TALK ABOUT THE BILLING CHIEF WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ANY QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSION WE HAVE JUST ON THE ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THAT WERE ACCEPTED. BY THE AUTHOR OF LOS YOU'LL TELL ME WHAT THE ACCEPTED THEM OR NOT. YES THE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AMENDMENTS. TO TEN FOURTEEN WHICH ADDRESSES SEVERAL OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE IN LAST WEEK'S HEARING. MY PRIORITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN CENTERED ON THE CLOSURE HOSPITALS AND EMERGENCY ROOMS AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON A COMMUNITY. AS SUCH THESE AMENDMENTS RETAIN THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TO A NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ONLY FOR HOSPITAL CLOSURES AND EMERGENCY. DEPARTMENT REDUCTIONS. I HAVE A GOOD CREE TO COMPLETELY STRIKE SECTION TWO OF THE BILL. WHICH EFFECTIVELY REMOVES ALL NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ON DOWNGRADES OR CHANGES ON RELATED TO EMERGENCY SERVICES. THESE MEMBERS ALSO REDUCE THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT FOR THE ELIMINATION OF A SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE FROM ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS TO NINETY DAYS. A SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES SOMETHING LIKE A BURN UNIT I NICK YOU PICK YOU OR SOME OTHER SERVERS THAT IS BEYOND THE BASIC SERVICES HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED. TO PROVIDE. AGAIN THIS NINETY DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT WOULD ONLY APPLY TO THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF A SERVICE. NOT A REDUCTION OR DOWNGRADE. LASTLY THESE AMENDMENTS CREATE A NOTICE EXEMPTION FOR CLOSURES OR SERVICE ELIMINATIONS DUE TO NATIONAL DEBT DISASTER OR THE STATE EMERGENCY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND A STAFFER WORKING CLOSELY WITH. SO AND THE SPONSOR ON CRAFTING THESE AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE THEY REPRESENT A FAIR COMPROMISE ON SEVERAL OF THE ISSUES WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK. MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THESE AMENDMENTS IS STEPHANIE ROBERSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] THANK. REMEMBER SEVENTY REPRESENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. COMING CONSULTATION WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL FOR MOVING THIS BILL FOR US I JUST WANNA MAKE A QUICK STATEMENT ON DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT THE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN WE TOOK FURTHER AMENDMENTS IN THE PAST HEARING THAT WE THOUGHT SATISFY CONCERNS. I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT IT'S VERY DEVASTATING WHEN HOSPITALS CLOSE AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WHEN HOSPITALS CLOSE THOSE SERVICES ARE NOT REPLACED WE KNOW THIS FOR A FACT. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE. THAT NOTICES HOSPITALS CLOSURES TO COMMUNITIES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS IN THE EVENT THAT A HOSPITAL PUT CLOSES SO WE CAN. POTENTIALLY BY SOME TIME TO GET ANOTHER OPERATOR AND THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TEMPORARY. WORKERS WERE HAPPY TO ENGAGE ON THAT ISSUE IF IF IF MEMBERS SO DESIRE TO TO DEAL WITH THAT THAT IS NOT ABOUT THIS BILL IT'S A SIMPLE NOTICED. BECAUSE WE ALL BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE BEACONS IN THE COMMUNITY IN THE NEXT SEISMIC EVENT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE HOSPITALS ARE OPEN AND WE WOULD ASSUME. THAT MEMBERS WILL WANT TO KNOW SOONER RATHER THAN LATER TO HAVE A PREPARED PLAN TO HAVE A WORKPLACE SAFETY PLAN TO HAVE. A AN EMPLOYER PLAN IN PLACE AND SO THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES NOT HAPPEN TO ENTERTAIN ANY CONVERSATIONS OR QUESTIONS BUT WE WOULD HOPE DATA. THIS BILL MOVES THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THIS BILL PROHIBITS RESTRICTIONS ON THE PRODUCTS BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY CONTAIN CVD FROM HIM. ALL OTHER EXISTING FOOD SAFETY LAWS LAWS WOULD APPLY. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FEDERAL FARM BILL REMOVED HIM FROM ALL FTA SCHEDULES AND WE CLASS OF IT RE CLASSIFIED HIM AS AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. THIS OPENS THE DOOR FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS TO CULTIVATE HIM AND IT'S PRESENTED CONSUMERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS CB DE. THAT WILL NOT RESULT IN A HIGH. THIS IS BECAUSE BY DEFINITION INDUSTRIAL HIM ONLY CONTAINS THREE TENTHS OF A PERCENT THC OR LESS WHICH IS THE CYCLE ACTIVE COMPONENT [inaudible] PRODUCTS.

WE CAN ALREADY BUY THESE PRODUCTS TODAY AT LOCAL GYMS COFFEE SHOPS WELLNESS STORES AND EVEN NOW IS CVS. SHOULD THE STATE NOT CHOOSE TO CLARIFY THE HEAD THAT HIM CVD PRODUCTS ARE LEGAL. THESE JOBS IN BUSINESS IN THIS BUSINESS WOULD BE LOST. AND CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THAT CURRENTLY PURCHASE TEMP CVD PRODUCTS WILL FACE A NEW BARRIER IN OBTAINING WHAT THEY NEED. WE CANNOT CONTINUE WITH UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER HAVE DERIVE CVD MAY BE LAWFULLY SOLD IN PERSON CALIFORNIA.

YEAH I DO I DO THERE YOU CAN COME UP TO THE TABLE OF THE PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF FIRST HELLO MY NAME IS SORRY MY VOICE. MY NAME IS CHRISTINE SKIRBALL Là AND I'M A FORMER PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY A TOXICOLOGIST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENTIST. AND MY CONCERN IS THAT HEMP IS A SUPER BIO ACCUMULATOR. OF TOXIC HEAVY METALS AND PESTICIDES. AND WE ARE. I AM VERY CONCERNED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY IN THE WAY THE WORDING AND THE BILL IS RIGHT NOW WHERE IT'S VERY VAGUE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF TESTING WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE DONE -- I THINK THAT IT SHOULD AT LEAST FOLLOW PROP SIXTY FIVE THRESHOLDS. FOR TESTING -- IN CAT FOR CANNABIS WE HAVE EVEN STRICTER TESTING AND I FEEL THAT WE REALLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION. TO THE ULTIMATE. NEEDS AND HEALTH OF OUR CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. AND OTHER STATES IN ALLOWING PRODUCTS TO GET ON THE MARKET. THAT ARE HEAVILY TAINTED FOR THAT HAVE VERY HIGH LEVELS BUT FELL PASSED SOME KIND OF A VERY SOFT. A THRESHOLD FOR OUR WHATEVER TO TESTING IS IN PLACE SO I REALLY URGE ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE. RECONSIDER. MAKING THE WORDING MORE SPECIFIC. FOR EXACTLY HOW YOU KNOW NOT JUST SAYING -- IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE ALL THE OTHER FOODS. NOW IT'S NOT LIKE FOODS PEOPLE ARE TAKING THIS IS MADISON. ALL THAT ARE TAKEN AS HOT THEY'RE SUSCEPTIBLE POPULATIONS AS IT IS. SO WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE SICK WE IT WILL BE GIVEN THIS MEDICINE. BECAUSE THEY WILL USE IT OF MEDICINE. AND WE'RE NOT PROTECTING THEM IF WE ALLOW. THE BILL TO GO THROUGH AS IT IS CURRENTLY WORDED. THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. THESE COME AT THE NECK FRAGRANT YET YOU CAN JUST GIVE HERE. HI -- THANK YOU ALL FOR LISTENING HERE TODAY -- MY NAME'S NICOLE AND A LICENSE CANNABIS MANUFACTURER I ALSO OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR A FEW REASONS -- FIRST THIS BILL DOES NOT PROPERLY DEFINED INDUSTRIAL HEMP. AS WE SAW WITH THE RECENT LETTER FROM THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. PEOPLE ARE CULTIVATING HIGH CBD CANNABIS THE CALLING AT HOME WE NEED STRICTER GUIDELINES AND LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL THAT ACTUALLY SPECIFIES WHAT IS INDUSTRIAL HAMPERS IS WHAT IS% CANNABIS BEING SOLD ON THE OPEN MARKET -- THE SECOND KIND OF PIGGYBACKING ON THAT IS THAT. BY ALLOWING HEMP INTO THE CANNABIS MANUFACTURE CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAIN THE STATE IS LOSING OUT ON CULTIVATION TAX FROM. CULTIVATORS IN CALIFORNIA HER LICENSE FARMERS IN A GROWING HIGH CVD PRODUCTS WE NEED TO SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE VERY FRAGILE. MANUFACTURED CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAIN -- LEAVE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE FARM BILL WHICH THE VAGUENESS ALSO IT'S PASSED ON TO THIS BILL ABOUT ALLOWABLE THC BEING POINT THREE DELTA NINE THRESHOLD -- THAT LANGUAGE SHOULD INCLUDE DELTA EIGHT IT SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE TEACH CA WHICH IS EASILY CONVERTIBLE WITH HEAT AND A PRODUCTS SITTING ON A SHELF OVER TIME -- BY NOT REGULATING THOSE YOU'RE CREATING GROSS LOOPHOLES THAT WERE WILL ALLOW CYCLE ACTIVE PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD ON THE OPEN MARKET AS WE ARE ALREADY SEEING AS LICENSE MANUFACTURERS -- SO. IN CONCLUSION THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS IN A VERY FRAGILE PLACE RIGHT NOW -- I URGE YOU ALL TO GIVE US A FAIR SHOT AT COMPETING IN THE HIGH CBT MEDICINAL CANNABIS MARKET AND LICENSE DISPENSARIES. CURRENTLY THIS BILL UNDERMINES THAT BY ALLOWING HAVE BEEN TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN THANK YOU. I THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION OKAY SAYING NINE AND THERE'S A MOTION YES -- CENTER GROWTH. YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS NOW THAT OPPOSITION HAS SPOKEN. IN YOUR STATEMENT IN THE WAY I READ BILL THERE'S IT'S NOT PSYCHO ACTIVE PRODUCTS IN THIS -- IN IT PASSES ALL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. BUT GETS PENINSULA GET BRADBURY WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIM COUNCIL LET ME JUST BE CLEAR IN CALIFORNIA IF IT EXCEEDS A POINT IS NOT CONSIDERED HIM. DESTROYED BEFORE IT IS HARVESTED IS IN FACT IT IS TESTED IN THE FIELD AND AND HAS TO PASS THAT TEST THIRTY DAYS BEFORE IT'S HARVESTED WITH THE PLAN OUT A GOOD ABOUT AND MUST BE. AGAIN AS I SAID DESTROYED -- WITH REGARD TO THE FDA QUESTION LANGUAGE IN THE BILL REQUIRES THAT ANYBODY WHO'S GOING TO MANUFACTURE AND HIM PRODUCT -- IN THE STATE HAS TO REGISTER UNDER THE HEALTH AND THE IF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AS A MANUFACTURER AND FOLLOW THE CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES WHICH IS THE SAME PROCESSES THAT EVERY FOOD PRODUCT IN THE STATE. HAS TO GO THROUGH THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- APPRECIATE-- THEIR RESPONSE -- THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED -- BY CENTER GROVE -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SO I GUESS I'LL SEE THAT BILL THERE.

I DO THAT NOW YES YOU MAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO THAT'S AYE NUMBER SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY EIGHT THANK YOU. AGAIN THANK YOU -- CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. AB EIGHT FORTY EIGHT MANDATES THAT MEDICARE ALL PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE. MONITORS WHEN MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT OF DIABETES. CALIFORNIA SUFFERS FROM EXTREME ECONOMIC AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES FOR DIABETICSDIABETIC POPULATION AND THIS DISPARITY IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOR ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIANS. THIRD BY MEDI CAL WHO'S CURRENTLY UNDER GO UP TO TEN TIMES AS MANY DIABETES RELATED AMPUTATIONS AS THEIR NON MEDICARE ALL COUNTERPART PARTS. MORE THAN TWO POINT THREE CALIFORNIA ADULTS HAVE DIABETES WITH 40% 43% OF THIS POPULATION RECEIVE RECEIVING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICO. MEDI CAL CURRENTLY OFFERS ONLY A FINGER STICK TEST TO MEASURE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. USING THIS METHOD PATIENTS MEASURE THEIR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS ON AVERAGE THREE TIMES A DAY AND IT JUST SO DOES THE INSULIN ACCORDINGLY. HOWEVER THESE INTERMITTENT SNAPSHOTS OF BLOOD SUGAR FAILS. A LEVELS FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHLY VARIABLE NATURE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS AND OFTEN PROVIDES A FALSE SENSE OF GLUCOSE MANAGEMENT. THIS METHOD ALSO FAILS TO PROVIDE. DURING SLEEP WHICH IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING AS 50% OF PATIENTS WILL EXPERIENCE NOCTURNAL HYPOGLYCEMIA AT LEAST ONCE PER NIGHT. IN CONTRAST THE GM'S PROVIDE READINGS EVERY FIVE MINUTES FOR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT TIMES PER DAY. CREATING A FAR MORE ACCURATE AND CLINICALLY RELEVANT PICTURE A BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS ALLOWING INSULIN DELIVERY TO BE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY. THE GM'S ALSO ALLOW HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO UPLOAD INTO VOTE VISUALIZE PATIENT DATA TO MONITOR ANY DIFFICULTIES OUR PATIENTS EXPERIENCE WITH MANAGING THEIR GLUCOSE LEVELS. AND MAKE SOUND MEDICAL DECISIONS BASED ON FULL DAY INFORMATION. THE GYMS ARE CLINICALLY APPROVED TO THE BEST MEANS TO MONITOR GLUCOSE LEVELS AND AVOID THE POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES A POORLY MONITORED BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS. SUCH AS HYPERGLYCEMIA AMPUTATIONS AND BLINDNESS. AB EIGHT FORTY EIGHT SIMPLY REQUIRES MEDI CAL TO PROVIDE THE SAME COVERAGE FOR CONTINUES BECAUSE CLOSE MONITORS. AS MEDICARE COVERED CALIFORNIA THE MEDICAID PROGRAM -- OF MORE THAN THIRTY OTHER STATES 90% OF MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM. AB EIGHT FORTY EIGHT IS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICAN DIABETES. OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AMONG OTHERS THERE'S BEEN NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY US REAR I WON'T. THANK YOU WITH THIS IS SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SHARE GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION AS LEADING THE COALITION. IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FOUR EIGHT OUR COALITION INCLUDES THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGIST. THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF DIABETES EDUCATORS THE DIABETES PATIENT ADVOCACY COALITION AND MANY MORE ARE COALITION SUPPORTS THE COVERAGE OF CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS WHEN PRESCRIBED BY A PHYSICIAN AS MEDICALLY NECESSARY. ARC OUR COALITION SUPPORTS THE COVERAGE OF CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS BECAUSE THE CGM. ALERT THE WEARER WHEN THEIR BLOOD CREEK GLUCOSE LEVELS GO DANGEROUSLY HIGH OR DANGEROUSLY LOW IN A WAY THAT TRADITIONAL FINGER STICK MEASUREMENT CAN ON TRADITIONAL FINGER STICK MEASUREMENT ONLY SHOWS A SNAPSHOT OF BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AT THE MOMENT. BUT DOES NOT WARN OF RAPIDLY RISING OR FALLING LEVELS WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE PATIENT TO MAKE INFORMED AFFECTIVE DECISIONS AND MAN [inaudible] OWN DISEASE. PEOPLE WITH DIABETES USE INSULIN EXPERIENCE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RATES OF EMERGENCY ROOM USE INSTANCES OF HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY. ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES REPORT SPENDING AND THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM ASSOCIATED WITH ADULTS AND ADULT INDIVIDUALS TREATED FOR DIABETES. TOTALED THREE POINT SIX BILLION WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 14% OF TOTAL SPENDING FOR NON DUAL ELIGIBLES. IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM ALLOWING THE MOST COSTLY 5% OF THOSE TREATED FOR DIABETES GENERATED ROUGHLY 36% OF ALL DIABETES SPENDING WELL THE MOST COSTLY TIME PERCENT GENERATED OVER 50% OF TOTAL DIABETES SPENDING. THESE HIGH RISK PATIENTS WOULD BENEFIT THE MOST FROM CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS. THE GM CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH DIABETES AND ALSO REDUCE COSTS TO THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM BY REDUCING THE SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIC EVENTS. THAT LEAD TO EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS. FIJIANS ARE CURRENTLY WIDELY COVERED IN CALIFORNIA BY PRIVATE PAYERS AS WELL AS PUBLIC PAYER SUCH AS MEDICARE AND THE CCS PROGRAM. MEANS HE OUT WIRE AB EIGHT FOUR EIGHT SIX TO CHANGE THAT SO THAT PEOPLE WITH DIABETES IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEDICALLY NECESSARY DOES DEVICE AS PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN IS FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT AB FOUR EIGHT FOUR EIGHT AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IPHONE.

WE CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF CHILDREN BUT THE WELL BEING OF THE MOTHER WHO GIVES BIRTH OFTEN GETS FORGOTTEN MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS ARE THE MOST COMMON COMPLICATIONS. OF THE PRE AND POST PARTUM STAGES AND THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH PROCESS WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS MAY NOT ASK FOR HELP. AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN SUCH AS A LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OR POVERTY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO POOR DETECTION AND TREATMENT RATES. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIA WOMEN WHO RECENTLY GAVE BIRTH EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION DURING OR AFTER PREGNANCY THIS MEANS THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE ISSUES. WITH MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH EVERY YEAR. ONE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS IS THE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AB SEVEN NINE EIGHT WILL CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDES PSYCHIATRY TELE CONSULTATION AND OR VIRTUAL MENTORING SERVICES TO HELP ADDRESS MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH. THIS PILOT PROGRAM OPERATE IN SEVERAL COUNTIES INCLUDING RIVERSIDE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF YOURS FURNISHING SERVICES TO POST PARTUM WOMEN. UP TO ONE YEAR AFTER DELIVERY. THIS BILL WILL HELP. MAKE IMPORTANT PROGRESS TOWARD ENSURING THAT WOMEN WITH MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS RECEIVE THE TREATMENT. THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY NEED AND DESERVE.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER RACE THAT THEY ARE SO YOU BACK THERE ARE EIGHT WELCOME SO IT'S ITEM NUMBER SIX AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I FOR FOSTER YOUTH WERE PLACED OUT OF COUNTY IN SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS KNOWN AS STR TEEPEES. ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE WHICH CHARGE I CHAIR HAS HELD TO HEARINGS IN THE PAST YEAR REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOUTH. ISSUE THE RECEIVED PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER. PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YOUTH WERE PLACED OUT OF COUNTY. UP OUT [inaudible] OUR TRANSIT. REPLACED OUT OF COUNTY IS TRANSFERRED FROM THE COUNTY OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION TO THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE YOUTH DISPLACED KNOWN AS COUNTY OF RESIDENCE. PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WAS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WELL SIGNIFICANT REFORMS WERE BEING MADE TO THE STATE'S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. ONE OF THESE REFORMS WAS TO END THE STATE'S RELIANCE ON GROUP HOMES AS ACCEPTABLE LONG TERM PLACEMENTS FOR FOSTER YOUTH. INSTEAD TO GROUP HOMES ARE BEING REPLACED BY STR TEEPEES WHICH PROVIDE SHORT TERM MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YOUTH WHO NEED A SPECIALIZED INTENSIVE SERVICES. PRIOR TO MOVING TO A FAMILY HOME. FOR FOSTER YOUTH WERE PLACED OUT OF COUNTY IN AN S. T. R. T. P. IT OFTEN DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO TRANSFER THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FROM THEIR HOME COUNTY ESPECIALLY WHEN AN S. T. R. T. P. BY ITS VERY NATURE IS MEANT TO BE SHORT TERM. ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS FOR A FOSTER YOUTH PLACE IN OUT OF COUNTY CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS. AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX ACCOMPLICES SEVERAL THINGS. IT ENSURES ADEQUATE AND TIMELY PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YOUTH BY MAKING PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER THE EXCEPTION. RATHER THAN THE RULE FOR YOUTH PLACED AN S. T. R. T. PIECE. IT ALSO ESTABLISHES MORE TRANSPARENT IN UNIFORM PROCESSES AND REQUIRES DATA ON IMPACTED YOUTH TO BE COLLECTED AND REPORTED. I WANT TO TAKE THE SAP OPPORTUNITY TO THANK COULD THE OPPOSITION FOR ENGAGING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE ISSUES. THEY'VE RAISED. I THINK WE SHARE THE SAME GOAL OF PROVIDING QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YOUTH IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION MOVING FORWARD IN FIGURING OUT HOW COULDHOW WE CAN ACHIEVE THE SHARED GOAL. THE PURPOSE OF THE CHILD WELFARE% SYSTEM IS TO PROVIDE OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH WITH SERVICES SUPPORT. AND THE CARE THAT THEY NEED TO TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD AND LEAD SUCCESSFUL FILLING LIVES AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX FURTHERS THIS PURPOSE.

BROUGHT TO LIGHT AREAS WHERE THE BILL'S WORKING REALLY WELL IN AREAS WHERE CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER. IN PARTICULAR THE AREAS OF THOSE TRANSFERS WHEN A CHILD IS PLACED INTO GROUP HOMER S. HERE T. P. TYPE OF FACILITY THE NEW VERSION OF THE GROUP COMES UNDER THE CONTINUUM OF CARE OF FORM. AND SO THE BILL FOCUS OF A LOT IN PA ON THOSE CHILDREN BECAUSE THINGS SEEM TO BE WORKING WELL FOR THE CHILDREN HER WITH A RELATIVE A GRANDPARENT OR A TRADITIONAL HOME. WE THINK THAT -- ASPECTS OF THE UNIFORMITY OF FORMS AND WORK TOWARD MORE UNIFORM -- CONTRACTING -- FOR COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO DRAW UPON WILL HELP. REYES OF COMMUNICATION AND WITH THE SPEED IN WHICH THINGS ARE TRANSFERRED SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE CHILD IS COMING AND THEY'RE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY AND HERE'S WHAT THEY NEED AND SO WE THINK THAT THOSE CHANGES IN THE BILL ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL. AND ON IN ADDITION CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF HOW WE PRESUME WHETHER OR NOT TO TRANSFER THAT RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CASE OF A CHILD IS IN A GROUP HOME. DOES I THINK DO A BETTER JOB NOW OF REFLECTING WHAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE THE CONTINUE OF CARE REFORM WAS ENACTED WHICH IS -- WE'VE LOST A LOT OF GROUP HELP GROUP CARE FACILITIES AND THAT WAS EXPECTED ON THE LOWER LEVEL HOMES WERE WERE WORKING TO FIND. PLACES FOR THE CHILDREN OF FAMILIES AND SO THEY'RE BETTER ABLE TO BE SERVED IN THOSE AND SO YOU SEE SOME CHANGES RELATED TO THAT -- AND SO -- WE JUST OVERALL REALLY APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE AUTHOR AND STAFF ON IN THE FIRST HOUSE AND WE SUPPORT THE BILL IN THE CURRENT FORM IN OF COURSE WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATIONS. I'D LIKE TO YOU KNOW THE OLD THE REST OF OUR TIME TO TO MESS HALL. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PHOEBE BELL DIRECTOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH FOR NEVADA COUNTY AND I'M HERE TO SHARE THIS PART I COUNTY HAS FOR A. B. EIGHT TWENTY SIX AS WRITTEN AND IMPORTANT CHANGES IT MAKES A. B.. TWELVE NINETY NINE SPECIFICALLY WE BELIEVE THIS TEAR TO BE SHOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER PROCESS WITH THE EXCEPTIONS. IN THIS BILL. NEVADA COUNTY BELIEVES DEEPLY IN CONTINUITY OF CARE AND ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR ALL CHILDREN BUT PARTICULARLY CHILDREN FACING THE DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE ABOUT OF HOME PLACEMENTS IN OUT OF COMMUNITY PLACEMENTS. PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WAS CREATED TO ADDRESS THIS GOAL WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE SUPPORT THAT DEEPLY. HOWEVER WHEN A CHILD'S PLACE IN A RESIDENTIAL SETTING SUCH AS AN S. T. R. T. P.. TRANSFERRING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CARE TO A NEW COUNTY DOES NOT AID IN THE TIMELY ACCESS TO QUALITY INAPPROPRIATE CARE. AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY THAT PROCESS HAS CREATED SOME UNINTENDED BUT SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON FISCAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITIES AND SMALL COUNTY SUCH AS NEVADA% COUNTY WHICH COULD BE DEVASTATING. SO WHAT THIS IS LOOK LIKE FOR NEVADA COUNTY SPECIFICALLY -- IN OUR COUNTY WE HAVE TWO S. T. R. TEEPEES WHICH EACH HAVE TWELVE BEDS -- THAT OUR LICENSING COULD BE FILLED WITH TRANSFERRED YOUTH. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE'VE HAD FORTY FOUR YOUTH TRANSFERRED TO US AND MORE IN PROCESS AS WE SPEAK. THIRTY THE COME FROM TWENTY DIFFERENT COUNTIES. AND IF BOTH OF OUR AUSTERITY PEAS WERE FILLED WITH TRANSFERRED YOUTH FOR THE FOUGHT THE UPCOMING YEAR THE FISCAL BURDEN TO US TO BE ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. PUT THOSE NUMBERS IN A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR SMALL COUNTY. WE TYPICALLY HELD A SMALL CONTRACT WITH ONE OF OUR S. T. R. TWO PEAS IN CASE IT LOCAL YOUTH NEED ABOUT LEVEL OF CARE. MOST YEARS WE THE U. ZERO DOLLARS THAT SERVICE ON AVERAGE ABOUT. TWENTY THOUSAND ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE CONTEXT OF THOSE FORTY FOUR YOU THAT HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO OUR COMMUNITY IN THAT SAME TIME PAID WE TRANSFERRED FIVE YOU THOUGHT OF IN ABOUT A COUNTY AND TEST THE R. T. P. SETTINGS. AND THEN LASTLY SPENDING ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON OUT OF COUNTY YOUTH -- THE IMPACTS ARE. TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT ALLOCATION AND ULTIMATELY COULD% IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO RIGHT NOW. THE ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO TRANSFERRED INTO C. R. T. PEAS FROM OUR COUNTY OF FIVE REFLECTS NOT JUST OUR SMALL POPULATION BASE BUT ALSO OUR DEEP COMMITMENT. TO INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT ALLOW CHILDREN AND YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE HOME SETTING OUR COMMUNITY SETTING AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. AND WE DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THAT INVESTMENT IN WHAT WE BELIEVE IS IN HERE INSTEAD A CONTINUING CARE REFORM PRINCIPLES. THE TENSION MAYBE TWELVE NINETY NINE WAS THE STREAMLINED CARE FOR CHILDREN THE GOAL THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. AND WE BELIEVE BLANK INCLUSION INVEST HERE TEEPEES IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE THAT GOAL WE THINK IT FRAGMENTS CARE FOR THEIR BY ENDING A CHILD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR HOME COMMUNITY IN THEIR HOME SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX IS AN APPROPRIATE EXTENSION IN THE SPIRIT OF AB. TWELVE NINETY NINE AND WE BELIEVE THAT AB TWELVE NINETY NINE WAS NOT CREATED TO SIMPLIFY ADMINISTRATOR FISCAL FUNCTIONS FIRST YEAR TWO PEAS. CARE FOR CHILDREN. FOR THOSE REASONS WE REALLY HOPE THE SUPPORT THIS BILL. OKAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITH THIS IS A SUPPORT. THE WITNESS SUPPORT BACK BACK FROM. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH -- THE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AND WHAT A LINE OUR COMMENTS -- WITH THEM AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. REVENUE MISTER TURN MEMBERS CONNIE DELGADO ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. AFTERNOON ALLENTOWN ON BEHALF OF THAT VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MAKE ROOM FOR THE WELCOME. HI GOOD AFTERNOON I THINK I HAVE MY NAME IS DOCTOR LINTHAL I'M A PRACTICING PSYCHOLOGIST ACTUALLY HERE IN YOUR DISTRICT. AND TODAY I'M REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICE WE ARE THE SPONSOR AND ASSEMBLY BILL. TWELVE NINETY NINE OUR MEMBERS ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL ACTUALLY TO AN EXTENT QUITE HONESTLY IT SURPRISED US. AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE COMPONENTS THAT WE FULLY SUPPORT OF THE BILL THE OPPOSITION -- FROM OUR MEN. NOT ALL OF US TO SUPPORT IT OR EVEN SUPPORT IF AMEND. WE SPONSOR THIS BILL ARE SORRY AB -- TWELVE NINETY NINE BACK IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE LONG STANDING PROBLEM OF CHILDREN HERE PLACE OUT OF CARE RECEIVING SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA THAT AND YOUR QUARTER THE REPORT RISK CORDON AROUND PORT IN YOUR ANALYSIS. OF CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL DID YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT PLACEMENTS WHERE THE CHILDREN WERE PLACED AND THE LOWEST RATE OF RECEIVING SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHEN THEY'RE OUT OF COUNTY. IS ACTUALLY WHEN THEY'RE PLACED IN GROUP CARE. SO KIDS THAT WERE PLACED IN GROUP CARE OUT OF COUNTY WORD AND NINETEEN POINT 2% RATE OF GETTING EVEN A SINGLE SERVICE. INDIVIDUALS IN COMPARISON WHO ARE PLACED IN FOSTER CARE WHICH BY ARGUMENT BUT HAVE LESS OF A NEED FOR SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WAS AT THIRTY SEVEN POINT 2% -- SO THAT REALLY SHOWS THAT THIS BILL THE BIGGEST NEED FOR THIS BILL ARE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES. I'M AWARE. OF I DO IT LET ME BACK UP AND SAY THAT WE ALSO PRESENT REPRESENT AS CHARITY PIECE SO WE PERCENT PROVIDER REPRESENT PROVIDER ASSOCIATIONS. SO THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE THESE CHILDREN. STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND THE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS FIXES THE RUN PROBLEM HAS -- DIRECTOR BELL SAID FROM NEVADA COUNTY THE PROBLEM THAT SHE IS EXPERIENCING IS THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGE WE HAD THAT IN THE ORIGINAL TWELVE NINETY NINE BILL. IT WAS AMENDED OUT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE DO THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CORRECT FIX. IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE HEARINGS THAT WE HAD ON TWELVE NINETY NINE ISSUES SO IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED AS A POSSIBLE FIX AT THAT TIME. ABSENT BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE REASONS WE'RE GLAD WE GET TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF -- BUT WE DO AT THIS TIME CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS. OKAY THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TINA AND COMMITTEE MEMBER QUESTIONS. OKAY THERE'S A MOTION FOR THE BILL -- SO I I GUESS ARE YOU WITH THE SAYS THIS QUESTION IN TERMS OF SO THE OPPOSITION REYES SEVERAL ISSUES I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE I I PRESUME YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT I GOT THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE YOURSELF FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE. IT SO I ENTER CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM OF OKAY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. THE CHILD IS TRANSFERRED TO THE NEXT YEAR THE P.. CAN I LIKE NEVADA COUNTY RIGHT AND THEY'RE SORT OF A BURDEN BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS NOW THAT THERE WAS A PRESUMPTION DAY INTO PICKING UP EVERYTHING SITE FROM EVERYONE FROM THE BAY AREA AND OTHER PLACES RIGHT -- SO THEY HAVE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS SO. SO IS SO IS IT GOING TO BE THE REGIONAL COUNTY THAT TO SUPPOSED TO COVER THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS SO THEY HAVE A RIGHT WE HAVE MANAGED CARE YEAH WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH MANAGED CARE UNDER MEDICARE AL IT'S THAT OR THAT'S WHAT THE FOSTER CARE YOUTH ARE ON SO. WITH THAT SO WOULD THAT'S A SAN FRANCISCO I I'M NOT GONNA TAKE I SHOULD PICK UP SAN FRANCISCO. SATURDAY SACRAMENTO CENTS ON THE DOWN THERE THAT ENDED ABOUT A COUNTY WILL NEVER DO THAT. I DON'T KNOW BUT ANYWAY SO AND THEN THEY GET IN THERE AND AS THE R. P. AND AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WELL THEY MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IS. SACRAMENTO HAS THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH YOU KNOW MAN MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH PLAN THAT WITH. THE HEALTH PROVIDERS IN SACRAMENTO ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO PAY NEVADA FOR THIS HOUSE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK SO THE BEYOND THE YEAH IN ADDITION TO JUST THE FOSTER CARE PIECE OF AT THE MENTAL HEALTH THESE THAT THE MEDICAL COVERAGE. SENATOR YOU'VE HIT UPON THE KEY QUESTION AND WHY WE ALL WERE AT THE TABLE FOR AB TWELVE NINETY NINE WHICH WAS. TOO OFTEN I COUNTY WOULD TRANSFER CHILD WHAT IT WAS WITH THE KINSHIP PLACEMENT OR TO A GROUP HOME AT THE TIME. AND THE COUNTY IN WHICH ONES WOULD SAY WELL IT'S NOT OUR KIDS IT'S IF YOUR KIDS SACRAMENTO YOU PAY FOR IT AND THAT BACK AND FORTH. WOULD MEAN THAT THE CHILD WOULD RECEIVE THE SERVICES SO TWELVE MONEY NINE ENDEAVORED TO SAY NO IF A CHILD IS TRANSFERRED THEIR TIGHT THEY GET THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ALSO ALL FOSTER CHILDREN ARE ENTITLED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES UNDER A PFD T. SO THERE'S NO QUESTION YOU KNOW THAT A CHILD THEY GET ASSESSED. UNDER MEDICAL NECESSITY WHAT THEY NEED IS WHAT THEY GET AND SHOULD GET TO SO IT'S NOT A LIKE -- THE TO KAISER PATIENT OR IT'S A FOR THAT MATTER MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM WE COVER THOSE CHILDREN AND SO FOR THE SMALL CAN IS LIKE ABOUT A REALLY THIS IS THE COLLISION BETWEEN. MAYBE CALL NINETY NINE WHICH WE WORK OUT TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WE STILL HAVE GROUP HOMES IN THE LANDSCAPE. AND NOW WE HAVE THE S. T. R. T. P. WHICH IS A HIGHER THERAPEUTIC MODEL. AND SO THOSE GROUP HOMES THAT MAYBE DIDN'T HAVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE THE ONES WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT TRANSFERRED HAPPENS TO THOSE KIDS GOT THE SERVICES THE AUSTERITY PLEASE. PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES WHETHER THEY CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY TO PROVIDE IT OR THEY PROVIDED IN HOUSE BUT THE IN THEIR RATE IT'S COVERED TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES SO WITH SO YEARS THE TIME TO GET TO THE POINT OF IT IS A BASICALLY SO THAT UNDER THIS BILL. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS THAT THAT CHILD TO USE REFER TESTY RPGS NOT TO DO THAT AND AS PRIDE GOING TO COME BACK? THEY SEND IT OVER THEIR EXCESS CAN THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR PLAN TO SETTLE DOWN THE BODY COUNTY YEAH REALLY TO SERVE THAT'S WHAT THE FACILITY IS I SENT OVER AND WHEN THEY GET BETTER I BRING ABOUT. YEAH THEN IN THE S. T. R. P. RATE THAT THE A SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND PICK ON MY OWN COUNTY WOULD HAVE TO PAY WITH AN INCLUDE BEING CLOSE OF ALL THE MEDI CAL PIECES THAT WOULD -- SO LIKE IT I'M JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE LOSE PAYING THE BILLS SO YOU COULD UNDERSTAND UNDER THIS BILL YOU'RE SAYING WHEN THE BY COUNTY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY THE BILL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT THERE. IT DEALT THAT DID TO GETTING THE BASICALLY TAKE YOUR RECEDING BUT THEY'RE NOT. WE'RE OVER BURNING THEMSELVES WHO IS PAYING THE THE HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH BILLS FOR THIS AND HOW IS THAT GOING TO BE PAID BY. WHO'S PAYING AND HOW IT HERE HOW'S IT GOING TO BE PAID UNDER THIS BILL UNDER THIS BILL IT WOULD BE FOR CHILD IT'S GOING TO BE PLACED IN S. T. R. T. P.. THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS WOULD LOOK AND SEE IS IT WORTH THE TRANSFER AND SO INSTEAD OF TRANSFERRING WITHOUT ASKING QUESTIONS WHICH IS WHAT TWELVE NINETY NINE IS IT'S WELL WAIT LET'S ASK QUESTIONS WILL THEY BE THERE. SHORT TERM DO THEY HAVE A PROVIDER THERE DO THEY HAVE FAMILY IN THAT COMMUNITY WE HAVE HEARD OF CASES WHERE A CHILD IS TRANSFERRED TO THIS YEAR TO BE IN A COUNTY WHERE CAN DOES RESIDE. BUT THEY NEED THAT INTENSIVE TREATMENT RENDON AND SO THE ANSWER TO BE IN THAT RATE THE MEDICAL SERVICES ARE INCLUDED HOW. IN IN A DOCTOR TOLD ME SPEAK TO THIS PROBABLY BETTER AS A BETTER TOOK UP DEPENDS ON WHETHER THAT S. HERE TO P. PROVIDES THE SERVICES IN HOUSE BY. HIRING CLINICIANS AND OTHERS OR CONTRACTS WITH THAT COUNTY TO BRING IN THE COUNTIES CLINICIANS AND OTHERS EITHER WAY THIS YEAR T. P. IS BY DEFINITION A PLACEMENT WHERE A CHILD SHOULD RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. RIGHT AND FOR NEVADA COUNTY IN THEIR SITUATION AND DOCTOR HALL CAN SPEAK TO THIS PROBABLY IS THEY THE S. R. T. P. IS NOT QUITE HEARING FROM THE COUNTIES ARE PLACING. IN ABOUT AN END THE S. YOUR TO BE FROM THE MOMENT THAT CHILD WALKS IN THE DOOR OR PROVIDING SERVICES. SO YOU'RE NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION I WOULD. SOURCES OF THE EXCHEQUER. THE SAME SACRAMENTO. YES THEY SHOULD BUT THERE'S SOME BACK AND FORTH AND THE ANSWER TO BE IS PROVIDING SERVICES AND COSTING THEM MONEY AND SAID IF YOU'RE TO P.. GOES TO THE COUNTY THAT THEY'RE IN. I SAY LOOK YOU GOT TO PAY FOR THIS LET'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE CHILD ENTITLED AND TYPICALLY WITH A YEAH WE WE DO. THIS WHAT CLEAR FIGHT THERE WOULDN'T BE THAT BACK AND FORTH AND WHO SHOULD BE PAYING FOR IT FOR ESTHER TP PLACE WITH SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO CLARIFY. IF THE CHILD IS POISONOUS HERE TO PETE AND THERE IS A PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER THEN THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE IS ONE WHO SHOULD PAY. AT THIS ONE BECAUSE YOUR TO YOUR CONCERN IS BECAUSE YOU'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL YES SO -- IF I MAY YES SO AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE AND ALSO FROM THE LETTER FROM NEVADA COUNTY AND OTHERS THEY DO SAY THAT THAT CHALLENGE IS THE FINANCIAL ISSUE. AND AS I MENTIONED THAT WAS IN OUR ORIGINAL LANGUAGE WE SAW WE PREDICTED THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND IT WAS REMOVED AT THE REQUEST OF A DH CS. AND SO THERE'S STILL AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX IT THAT WAY. RATHER THAN A BLANKET EXEMPTION FOR AS CHAIR TEEPEES I DO WANT TO CORRECT SOMETHING. THAT WAS SAID IS IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC -- MOVE ONCE A CHILD MOVED OUT OF COUNTY WE INTENTIONALLY BUT THE LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. SO THAT THE CHILD'S PLACEMENT WORKER WHO KNOWS THE CHILD BEST. TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION WHERE'S THE CHILD GOING WHAT ARE THE CHILD'S NEEDS AND IS THIS A REASON TO EXERCISE ONE OF THE EXCEPTIONS. THE EXCEPTIONS ONE OF THEM WAS EXPLICITLY FOR SHORT TERM PLACEMENTS IT SAYS THE YOUTH PLACEMENT IN A COUNTY OTHER THAN THE COUNTY OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION IS EXPECTED TO LAST FOR SIX MONTHS OR LESS WE PUT THAT IN THERE FOR US HERE DE PIECE. BUT ALL THE OTHERS COULD ALSO BE APPLIED AND EXERCISE IF THE COUNTY FEELS THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO TRANSFER THAT CHILD. AND THEY WANT TO TAKE. SHIP OF THAT CHILD AS FAR AS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY WERE SAYING THAT THOSE EXCEPTIONS-THAT THEY'RE SAYING IT'S A CONCERN WE MOVE THEM BECAUSE THESE ARE ISSUES CLINICALLY WHEN A CHILD MOVES WE ALREADY BUILT THAT INTO THE ORIGINAL BILL SO WE'RE CONCERNED -- THAT WE'RE GOING DOWN THIS DIFFERENT PATHWAY. ALSO AT THIS BILLS ENACTED WE WOULD THEN HAVE THREE THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT THE PLACEMENT WORKER WOULD HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF IF A CHILD IS MOVED OUT OF PLACEMENT. SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE IS STILL IN THE FACT THAT THAT. IMPACTS AID TO DOCTOR KIDS AP KIDS THEY GO DOWN ONE PATH WITH ONE SET OF PAPERWORK. THIS WOULD CREATE A SECOND. PATHWAY WITH DIFFERENT PAPERWORK AND A THIRD PATHWAY WITH DIFFERENT PAPERWORK FOR THE KIDS WHO ARE NOT IN EITHER THE SITUATION SO THE COUNTY IS GOING TO HAVE. AN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN KEEPING TRACK OF HIS GUN WHERE AND WHAT PAPERWORK NEEDS TO BE ATTACHED TO THEM. OKAY SO. NOW YOU TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION SAID EVEN WITH ANY AMENDMENTS. THAT YOU WOULD STILL STILL SAY OPPOSE SO IS THERE A PATH TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE OKAY YES AND WE'VE ALREADY STARTED WORKING WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THEY'VE BEEN VERY GRAY EYES. AND ICE IN THE AUTHORS WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I KNOW SHE USUALLY IS. IN FACT THE OPPOSITION JUST CAME IN -- OF A WEEK AGO SO WE IT'S ALREADY GONE THROUGH. OUR HOUSE -- WITHOUT OPPOSITION AND SO WE ABSOLUTELY ENGAGED ONCE WE RECEIVE TO THE LETTER OF OPPOSITION AND THIS PARTICULAR BILL HAS BEEN. TRIPLE REFERRED. THERE ARE FEW. OPPORTUNITIES TO TO GET TO THE POINT TO WHERE WE WE ALL WILL BE FINE OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY FOR THE ISSUES RELATED TO THIS COMMITTEE AND ALSO I THINK THE GOAL THE BILL IS ONE THAT I SUPPORT I THINK IT'S NOT FAIR FOR SMALLER COUNTIES THAT. HAVE FACILITIES THAT THEY'RE NOW ALSO MADE JUST BECAUSE THEY DECIDE TO BE THE LOCATION OR DALY OUT AND THE PEOPLE DECIDE TO OPEN THESE TYPES O FACILITIES THAT DAY NOW ARE UNDER FINANCIAL DOES DRESSED SO WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT. I APPRECIATE CONTINUE TO WORK I'M SURE SO IT GOES TO I THINK HUMAN SERVICES AND OTHER COMMITTEES. THE HEALTHY THESE THINGS WILL WORK OUT CERTAINLY I YOU KNOW STRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AND NOW BEING THAT THOUGH THAT YOU'LL WORK TOGETHER AND WORK OUT THE REMAINING ISSUES THAT. ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A YES CENTER STUDY RESEARCHERS WANT -- TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY OF THE HOPES THAT YOU. HAVE A GOOD MEETING OF THE MINDS AND A GOOD COMPROMISE COMES INTO. PLAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. TO PRESENT THAT. OKAY SO IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SIR LEYVA THE MOTION IS TO HUMAN pCOMMITTEE AND I THINK -- WELL CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES WILL BE JOINING US SOON -- SHE'S ON THE COMMITTEE -- SO SECRETARY -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HI CAN I STONE. THE RAZA. DRAWS -- I'D GROVE. HER TADO. LEYVA HI LEYVA I'D MITCHELL HI MITCHELL AYE MONNING. MONNING AYE RUBIO. RUBIO I THE BILL A SIX VOTE SO WILL BUT THE BILL A CALL THAT'S ABOUT TO GET VERY MAKING ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.% AND WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE. LAST BUT NOT LEAST ITEM NUMBER. NINE AB [inaudible] NINE TWENTY TWO WELCOME. I REMEMBER MYSELF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS AB NINE TWENTY TO INTEREST RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS ARE FAIRLY TREATED BY REMOVING THE PROHIBITION ON COMPENSATION FOR WOMEN. PARTICIPATING IN A DONATION FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES ALREADY ALLOW FOR COMPENSATION NEW YORK DETERMINED THAT IT WAS ETHICAL AND APPROACH. BUT THE WOMEN FOR DONATING -- SITES FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES AND THAT PAYMENT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THE STATE. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT WOMEN ARE TREATED EQUALLY TO ALL OTHER RESEARCH SUBJECTS ALLOWING THEM TO ACTIVELY EVALUATE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH STUDIES AND TO BE PAID FOR THEIR TIME TROUBLE. AND INCONVENIENCE WHEN THEY DO PARTICIPATE. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF EMPOWERING WOMEN TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTH ARE IN CALIFORNIA THAT SHOULDN'T STOP WHEN THEY WHEN IT COMES TO RESEARCH. NO ONE TAKES A DONATION LIGHTLY ASSISTED -- SITE PRODUCTION TAKES TIME A COMMITMENT TO A RIGID HORRIBLE PROTOCOL AND DISCOMFORT THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT. IT IS A PROCESS THAT I KNOW FIRST HAND I THINK AT THIS POINT EVERYBODY. IN THE BUILDING KNOWS THAT A HUH THAT -- IF IT WEREN'T FOR IVF I WOULD NOT HAVE MY DAUGHTER. ISABELLA AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THOSE WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN RESEARCH. NOT BEING COMPENSATED HOWEVER THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO DO THAT -- WHEN I FIRST STARTED REACHED FERTILITY TREATMENTS THIRTEEN YEARS AGO THE HORMONE INJECTIONS WERE DIFFERENT THE PROCESS WITH DIFFERENT -- AND TODAY HE TREATMENT IS TAILORED AND MUCH MORE AND MUCH EASIER -- WOMEN GO UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY NOW CAN PARTICIPATE INFERTILITY TREATMENTS THERE'S BATTLE CRYO PRESERVATION OF EVERY. AND MORE EFFECTIVE PRENATAL CARE ALL OF THESE ADVANCES IN TREATMENT ARE DUE TO OUR ADVANCEMENTS IN RESEARCH. WE HAVE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF PROTECTION TO GUARD AGAINST EXPLOITATION OF DONORS WE HAVE A THOROUGH LAWS REGULATIONS AND INFORMED CONSENT FOR TEACH TEACHERS. WE HAVE HUMAN SUBJECT RESEARCH PANELS AND INSTITUTIONAL REVIW BOARDS THAT ENSURE THAT PARTICIPANTS ARE SCREENED AND INFORMED ABOUT THE RISKS. AND BENEFITS OF TREATMENT THESE ARE PROCESS THAT WE TRUST TO PROTECT EVERY OTHER RESEARCH PARTICIPANT AND A FULLY EXTEND TO EIGHT DOLLARS. REMOVING THE BAN ON COMPENSATION ALLOWED A DONOR'S JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER RESEARCH PARTICIPANT TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON PARTICIPATION AND TO BE APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATED. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MY CELL CEDARS AND MACROSCOPIC I THINK THAT'S BEEN CHANGED SO WE NOW I WHAT THEMSELF ENERGIES. NINE OKAY SO. THEN GAS -- THE RULES ARE SIX MINUTES TOTAL YOU CAN DO LESS IF YOU WANT TO ADD SO BETWEEN ALL OF YOU SO WE HAD FIFTY SIX MINUTES EVEN IF YOU DON'T ENOUGH TIME FOR THE PEOPLE FOLLOW AFTER. WILL HAVE TO STOP THERE BUT AGAIN WELCOME AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SUPPORT THE REPORT. DOCTOR PAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS MARCEL CEDARS AND I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGIST AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY. UCSF MEDICAL CENTER. AS I'VE WORKED WITH PATIENTS UNDERGOING THESE PROCEDURES FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I CAN SPEAK WITH SOME AUTHORITY ABOUT THE PROCEDURES INVOLVED THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND HOW TO ADDITIONALLY THE RESEARCH I DO ON A DAILY BASIS HAS CLEARED DIRECT AND POTENTIALLY IMMEDIATE CLINICAL IMPLICATION TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FR MY PATIENTS. AND I KNOW THAT WITHOUT COMPENSATION WE CANNOT OBTAIN THE SITES TO DO FURTHER RESEARCH THAT ONE MID DAY MAY IMPROVE CARE FOR WOMEN. OVARIAN STIMULATION OVERSIGHT RETRIEVAL ARE TIME CONSUMING AND ARDUOUS THE ETHICS COMMITTEE OF BOTH THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE AND THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH. HAVE CONSIDERED THE ISSUE OF COMPENSATION FOR DONOR AND HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT COMPENSATION IS WARRANTED AND ETHICAL. OUR ANALYSIS OF COMPENSATION DOES NOT CHANGE ON THE END USE OF THE DONATION WHETHER TO HELP CREATE A FAMILY OR FOR RESEARCH. BUT IN CALIFORNIA COMPENSATION IS PROHIBITED ESSENTIALLY CLOSING OFF RESEARCH WHICH COULD OTHERWISE BE DONE BY THE WORLD RENOWNED SCIENTIST IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE ONE OF ONLY ONE OF THREE STATES THAT HAVE SUCH A BAN. ACCORDING TO FEDERAL RESEARCH GUIDELINES ALL RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS MUST BECOME. FOR THEIR TIME TROUBLE AND INCONVENIENCE THEM AND FROM RESEARCH ADDITIONALLY ALL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS IS REVIEWED BY AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD WHOSE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS FROM UNDUE RISK AND INFLUENCE. IT IS ALSO THE JOB OF THESE BOARDS TO SET COMPENSATION FOR RESEARCH SUBJECTS THERE'S NO REASON THIS WELL ESTABLISHED POLICY OF OVERSIGHT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FOR WOMEN WHO DONATE -- SITES TO SCIENCE. FURTHER ANY RESEARCH THAT INVOLVES REPRODUCTIVE TISSUES MUST UNDERGO AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF REVIEW BY A SEPARATE COMMITTEE. THAT IS COMPOSED OF SCIENTISTS ETHICISTS AND LAY PERSONS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE SOLE REASON THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE DID NOT RECOMMEND COMPENSATION IN THE ORIGINAL GUIDELINES WAS OUT OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY BECAUSE OF CONCERN FOR CREATING ADDITIONAL CONTROVERSY OVER A LOT OF ROUND THE INITIAL EMBRYO STEM CELL RESEARCH. THE SAME CONCERN EXTENDED TO THE CALIFORNIA STEM CELL RESEARCH INSTITUTE. EVERY MEDICAL PROCEDURE HAS A LEVEL OF RISK OVARIAN% STIMULATION RETRIEVAL AS WAS MENTIONED OUR STANDARD PROCEDURES USED FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. LAST YEAR THIS PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED IN OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WOMEN GLOBALLY. XIN INDUCTION STRATEGIES ARE THOUGHT TO ALL BUT ELIMINATE THE RISK OF OVARIAN STIMULATION SYNDROME AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT RETRIEVING TEN TO TWENTY AEGS YIELD OPTIMAL EGG QUALITY BOTH FOR RESEARCH INFERTILITY PURPOSES. STUDIES REGARDING CANCER RISK HAVE BEEN LARGELY REASSURING. AND THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASED RISK FOR BREAST OVARIAN OR UTERINE CANCER. LONGER TERM FOLLOW UP IS OBVIOUSLY DESIRABLE AND IS PART OF THE MOTIVATION BEHIND A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. THE FUND A VOLUNTARY REGISTRY. LET ME JUST ALSO ADD -- THAT CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT LOW INCOME WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR IN IMMIGRANTS BEING TARGETED FOR THIS RESEARCH. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE AND IN FACT THE TWO STATES CURRENTLY ENROLLING IN ARGAN IN NEW YORK. HAVE HAD DONORS WHO WERE PRIMARILY CAUCASIAN AND WITH A COLLEGE EDUCATION THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT RECRUITMENT -- TARGETING OF UNDER RERESENTED MINORITY YOU'RE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS AWARD THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSENT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THIS COMMITTEE RECOGNIZE THE WELL ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE IN SOCIETY THAT WHEN SOCIETY BENEFITS FROM RESEARCH -- COMPENSATION TO THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE AND CONTRIBUTE AND WE OWE THESE WOMEN THE PERSPECTIVE KNOWLEDGE THEY ARE CAPABLE OF WEIGHING THE RISKS ARE PARTICIPATION AND THE REWARDS OF CONTRIBUTING TO SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. I THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE. I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY. IN MAKING IT EASIER TO ACCESS TO MAX FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES MY NAME IS BANKS TERRACE AND I AM A TRAINED CAN CLAIM RELIGIOUS. I ALSO HAVE A PC FOR COMMISSION ADVERSITY AND QUALIFIED RESEARCH REPRODUCTIVE. MEDICINE. THIRTY THREE TO TRY TO BIOLOGY -- I HAVE ROOTED FOR THE PATIENTS AND A DONOR'S UNDERGOING ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES. BEAU HAS AN EMBRYOLOGIST AS A RESEARCHER BY THE PROCEDURES INVOLVED OR LONG CAN BE STRESSFUL AND IS THAT IT ANY OTHER MEDICAL. MEDICAL PROCEDURE I HAVE THEIR RISK. I BELIEVE THERE IS BIG POTENTIAL AB OR WE CAN MAKE ASSIST REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY IS MUCH MORE PATIENT FRIENDLY MUCH SAFER AND MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE FOR TO BE ACCESSIBLE FOR MANY MILLIONS OF WOMEN. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO SHARE WITH YOU BY I THINK IT OFTEN JUST LAW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THAT -- OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CASES OF IN VITRO FERTILIZATION OCCURRING PER YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW. COSTING OVER. FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER PROCEDURE USUALLY BEING PAID DIRECTLY BY THE PATIENT. RIGHT NOW PATIENTS NEEDS TO INJECT THEMSELVES THAN TO FIFTEEN HOME INJECTIONS BEFORE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THE PROCEDURE ITSELF. A DECENT INJECTIONS CAN BE UNPLEASANT I RESULTING IN UNUSUALLY UNCOMFORTABLE BLOATING AND SWELLING. WHY THE FREQUENCY FOR VERY HIGH PROCEED STIMULATION SYNDROME HAS BEEN ACCUSED -- I DO TO ADVANCE IN THE FIELD THERE IS PROMISING RESEARCH WHERE WE CAN ELIMINATE THESE RISKS ALTOGETHER. OR A CONSTANT MEDICAL HEALTH INCLUDING THE VERY FIRST IVF BE BORN OVER FORTY YEARS AGO. HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. THERE IS STILL SO MUCH WE CAN DO A FOR WOMEN AND COUPLES SITTING FOR THROUGH THE TREATMENT RESEARCH IS CURRENTLY BEING SOLD IN CALIFORNIA -- DUE TO LACK OF COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPANTS. TO USE MY ORGANIZATION AS AN EXAMPLE I AM BELIEVE SCIENTISTS AT A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION THIS IS TRYING TO DEVELOP. A WASTED AT WOMEN DO NOT NEED WOMAN INJECTIONS -- I WOULD LIKE THANK YOU. FOR LISTENING TO MY TESTIMONY AND I WILL SELECT THE STATE AT AS MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS BOTH RESEARCH PUBLIC -- AND ACADEMIC. RESEARCH CAN LEAVE CALIFORNIA BE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SHOES. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME OR THE SHANNON SMITH PELLY REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE WHERE THE SPONSORS OF THIS AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORT. MY COLLEAGUES AT ALL REPRESENTING AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN AND CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. BRENT SPENCE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OBGYN THIS TO SHIP NINE IN SUPPORT OKAY THANK YOU. RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A SAYING NONE -- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS BEEN MOTION MOVED AVAIL US ARE DRUG. YES -- I KNOW YOU YOU MENTIONED. ONE OF THE CONCERNS SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE THAT WAS RAISED AS THE IMPACT ON WELL WOMEN OF COLOR -- I WOULD ADD TO THAT POOR WOMEN -- ARE THERE ANY I'M NOT SUGGESTING AMENDMENT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT HOWEVER ARE THERE ANY. MEASURES NOW OR DATA SYSTEMS NOW THEY COLLECT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WE DON'T WAIT. UNTIL AND RAIN IF THERE EVER WAS AN ABUSEOF THAT PARTICULARLY IMPACTED POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. SO THAT THIS DOESN'T BECOME A AND IT IS STILL A COUPLE THINGS. ONE WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR SUNSET ON THE BILL SO THAT IF THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL BE A GREAT. REST BUT FURTHERMORE WE FOUND STUDIES FROM COLUMBIA BOTH THE NEW YORK AND CITIES IN OREGON SHOWING THAT THE BULK OF THE PEOPLE PARTICIPATING OVER 454% IN. NEW YORK OR CAR OCCASION AND 86% AND HARD AGAIN WERE CAUCASIAN -- THIS IS ALL IT'S IT IT'S A LONG PROTOCOL OF THIS IS NOT A SHORT THIS IS NOT A SHORT BURST OF MONEY THIS IS NOT A MAN GOING IN. FOR A HOWEVER WE SAID TWENTY MINUTES BUT WHATEVER HOWEVER LONG. GOING INTO DO THEIR PORTION THIS IS AN ARDUOUS PROCESS THAT -- TAKES TIME. OUT OF YOUR SCHEDULE AND OUT OF YOUR OUT OF YOUR LIFE AND SO IT IS NOT THIS IS NOT A QUICK BURST OF MONEY AND I THINK THAT THAT. THE CONCERN FROM THOSE WHO ARE -- LESS EDUCATED ON HOW THIS PROCESS REALLY WORKS. MIGHT I ALSO ADD THAT ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONAL READ REVIEW BOARDS COLLECT DATA ON RACE AND ETHNICITY OF PATIENTS -- SUBJECTS -- IT DOESN'T COLLECT FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THAT CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN THOSE OF US WHO DO RESEARCH CAN DO BUT THEY DO COLLECT RACIAL AND ETHNIC INFORMATION AND WE HAVE TO SUBMIT. CONSENT FORMS AND THOSE WHO'VE CONSENTED AND THAT KIND OF SUMMARY DATA ON A YEARLY BASIS. WELL I WOULD ESPECIALLY IF. YOU KNOW THERE'S A A SUNSET I WOULD REALLY URGE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY TIMES -- THAT POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR ARE ABUSED -- IN MEDICINE AND ITS SYSTEMIC -- SO IT REALLY YOU KNOW WATCH OUT FOR THAT RAIN AND MAYBE GET YOU KNOW ON A VOLUNTARY SINCE WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT. BUT BEGIN TO GATHER THAT VERY EXPLICIT INFORMATION BECAUSE I THINK INCOME LEVELS ARE. ALSO HIGHLY IMPORTANT AND NOT JUST -- ETHNICITY THANK YOU AND I WOULD AGREE IT'S A VITAL QUESTION. SENATE MITCHELL. I WOULD JUST THINK THAT THAT I'M ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT -- TO MY COLLEAGUE I THINK IN THIS INSTANCE -- WOMEN OF COLOR AND POOR WOMEN -- HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AS WELL AND SO WHAT WE DON'T WANT THEM EXPLOIT IT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- ALL DESCRIPTORS ARE WRITTEN IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SO EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM -- I I KNOW SOME OF THE THE WE PAY TO WRITE SOCIAIS SINCE I TYPICALLY LINE WITH -- LATINAS REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND OTHERS ARE IN OPPOSITION BUT I THINK I ALSO DON'T WANT TO CREATE. A A EIGHT DIFFERENT EXPECTATION WOMEN OF COLOR AND POOR WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT. ALL THEIR BODIES JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE I THINK THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE THAT I WOULD TAKE ON IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS -- AND NOT ASSUME THAT POOR WOMEN ARE GOING -- TO EXCESSIVELY UTILIZE IT TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THEIR ACHES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY SO I I JUST -- THAT WHAT THAT SOME NUMBER GOING THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I KNOW THIS. TOPIC THAT WAS INVOLVED IN A DEBATE IN THIS INTERNALLY WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. ABOUT THE SAY THAT CERTAINLY THE ISSUES OF EXPLOITATION WERE BROUGHT UP BUT I ALSO WANT TO BRING -- POINT OUT THAT -- AND ONE REASONS I'D WANT TO LOOK AT THE DATA IS ACTUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND -- TO OFF AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH REPRESENTATION BY WOMEN OVERALL THOUGH CERTAINLY THIS RESEARCH ALLEN WE'VE SEEN REPORTS ABOUT THAT. AND ALSO -- SURREALISM MCCARTY MYSELF. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE RESEARCH IS ONLY DONE IN NON MINORITY POPULATIONS AND THEN APPLY TO US THEN THAT'S PROBLEMATIC AS WELL SO -- THERE'S A REASON YOU HAVE AN I. R. B. HAD -- INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD -- AS A RESEARCHER IT HAD TO HAVE MY A TUG OF WAR WITH THE I. R. B. ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT AND DEMAND AND ACTUALLY THEY CAN REQUIRE I MEAN WE CAN I CAN ARGUE BUT THEY WILL REQUIRE. TO BE SURE THAT THAT IS. TODAY PERFECT NO -- BUT CERTAINLY THEY'RE VERY THOROUGH AND I KNOW THAT EVERY RB I EVER WORKED WITH DEFINITELY IT IS FIGHTING FOR ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENT I MEAN THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE WITH THEM BUT THEY'RE DEFINITELY LIKE OKAY FROM THE BASES PERSPECTIVE THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROTECT. THEM AND SO I THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY RECOGNIZING WHO REALLY WANT TO DO IS INSURE WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATE IN THIS RESEARCH VITAL IMPORTANT RESEARCH. THATTHEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE SAME.
