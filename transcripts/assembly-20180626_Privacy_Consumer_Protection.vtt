00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:15.085
SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER

00:49:15.152 --> 00:49:16.453

WE ARE EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:51.755
THAT THE COMMITTEE AND IT'S VERY

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:53.190
THOROUGH ANALYSIS WAS.

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:54.825
TRYING TO THINK FOR CREATIVE

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:57.127
SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE WHAT HAPPENED

00:49:57.194 --> 00:49:58.962
LAST WEEK AND WE WE APPRECIATE

00:49:59.029 --> 00:49:59.596
THAT.

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:01.098
ON THE CHALLENGE WITH DOING IT

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:02.199
YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST SAW IT IS

00:50:02.265 --> 00:50:03.333
VERY TEMPTING TO SAY YEAH OF

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.468
COURSE HE WOULD DO THAT.

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:06.703
IS ARE THERE SOMETHING A LITTLE

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:07.471
BIT --

00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:09.072
CHALLENGING WITH PASSING A STATE

00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:11.908
LAW TO SAY YOU HAVE TO COMPLY

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:13.243
WITH A REPEALED.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.177
FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO SOMETHING

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:17.848
AS CRAFTING IT AND I KNOW THAT

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.783
THE STAFF I'M SO HAD.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.118
IT'S NOT BEEN A JAILBREAK FROM

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.419
LAST WEEK HOLLYWOOD WORK.

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:24.020
GUESSING MAY HAVE TRIED TO WORK

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:25.322
WITH US TO DO THAT --

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:27.691
BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT WAY TO

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:29.526
TO TO GET OUT IT. TO SOME A

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:30.894
LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING ABOUT.

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:33.630
ALSO THE WITH THE ORDER --

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:34.698
THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF IT

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:37.467
THAT ARE NOT NET NEUTRALITY --

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:39.736
AND SO IT WOULD BE ACQUIRING

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:41.405
COMPLIANCE WITH THEM THINGS THAT

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:42.973
NO ONE ON ANY SITE IS.

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:44.608
IS ASKING --

00:50:44.674 --> 00:50:46.343
FOR AND IN ADDITION UP PARTS OF

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.446
THIS ORDER ARE ON RESPONDING TO

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:50.781
PUBLIC COMMENT.

00:50:50.847 --> 00:50:51.915
THERE'S A LOT OF TO SORT OF

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.417
COLLOQUY THING THERE WAS THIS

00:50:53.483 --> 00:50:55.051
COMMENT THIS IS OUR RESPONSE.

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:57.220
SO IT JUST DOESN'T MATCH UP IN

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:57.821
THE WAY THAT YOU WANT TO AND

00:50:57.888 --> 00:50:58.922
THAT'S WHY.

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:00.891
ARE WE SPENT OUR SIGNIFICANT

00:51:00.957 --> 00:51:03.760
AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY --

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:06.096
MY STAFF OUTSIDE FOLKS ARE

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:07.864
TAKING WHAT'S IN THIS ORDER THAT

00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:09.566
IS ACTUALLY LEGAL OBLIGATION

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:10.867
AROUND THE NEUTRALITY.

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:11.835
AND PUTTING IT INTO A BILL

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:15.672
WITHOUT BEST APPROACH SO --

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.007
SO GO WERE APPRECIATIVE OF THE

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.208
CREATIVE THINKING ABOUT WHERE

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:19.843
WERE UNABLE TO ACCEPT THAT

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:20.911
AMENDMENT OKAY WELL I JUST

00:51:20.977 --> 00:51:21.812
THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:23.513
BEEN A KIND OF A CREATIVE WAY OF

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.682
SOLVING THE DILEMMA WAS CREATIVE

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:26.383
ELEGANCE.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.084
BUT I'M WERE PURCHASED IT

00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:29.052
DOESN'T MATCH UP.

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.420
IT'S PERFECTLY AS WE WOULD LIKE

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:32.556
SO OKAY WELL I MEAN I I HAVE TO

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:34.491
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL

00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:36.126
TODAY BUT I WANTED TO TAKE.

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:39.863
A MINUTE AND TELL YOU WHY AND

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.164
WHAT I TALKED TO CONSTITUENTS

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:42.799
ABOUT THIS ISSUE IT'S ALWAYS A

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.768
DIFFICULT DISCUSSION BECAUSE

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:45.602
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT INTERNET

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:47.103
NEUTRALITY YOU TALK ABOUT AN

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.905
OPEN AND FREE INTERNET IN A LACK

00:51:48.972 --> 00:51:50.073
OF DISCRIMINATION.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.274
THESE WORDS ARE VERY EMOTIONALLY

00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:52.642
EVOCATIVE.

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:54.945
AND IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO SAY

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:55.545
WELL HOW COULD YOU NOT SUPPORT

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:56.847
THAT.

00:51:56.913 --> 00:51:58.582
BUT I LIKE TO USE THAT ANALOGY

00:51:58.648 --> 00:51:59.850
AND A FEW FOR ABUSE IT BEFORE I

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.952
APOLOGIZE BUT I I TELL PEOPLE

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:03.220
THAT THE INTERNET'S KINDA LIKE

00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:04.754
VILLAGE BY A RIVER.

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.890
AND THE VILLAGERS CAN SEE ACROSS

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.625
THE RIVER THIS HIGHWAY BUT THEY

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:09.693
CAN'T GET TO IT IT'S VERY

00:52:09.759 --> 00:52:11.795
FRUSTRATING AND ONE DAY A BRIDGE

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:12.863
COMPANY DECIDES TO BUILD A

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:15.165
BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER THAT IS OF

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:16.299
GREAT BENEFIT TO EVERYONE THAT

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:17.667
LIVES IN THE VILLAGE.

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:19.102
SO MORE AND MORE PEOPLE USE THIS

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:20.971
BRIDGE EVERYDAY AND THE BRIDGE

00:52:21.037 --> 00:52:22.405
IS ONLY DESIGNED TO HOLD A

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:23.773
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AT ONCE.

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.609
SO THE BRIDGE COMPANIES GOING TO

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:26.743
HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO THEY

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.478
LIMIT THE TRAFFIC TO THE BRIDGE.

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:29.446
AND SO TO COME UP WITH THIS

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:30.614
PROPOSAL THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.782
CHARGE A DIFFERENT TOLL FOR

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:33.350
EIGHTEEN WHEELERS ON HONDA

00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:35.252
CIVICS EIGHTEEN WHEELERS PAY

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:37.053
MORE BECAUSE THEY WAY MORE.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.488
AND THEY ALSO MAY BE THAT THAT'S

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:40.123
A PAID PART OF OUR THAT'S

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.758
DIFFERENTIAL PRICING.

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.326
RIGHT THE IN THE ANALOGY I'M

00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:44.928
ALSO GOING TO ADD A TOLL ROAD

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:45.862
PETROLEUM TO THE BRIDGE

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:46.162
[inaudible]

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:47.664
THAT.

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.399
PEOPLE CAN PAY TO GO ACROSS THE

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:50.867
BRIDGE WITH LESS TRAFFIC WHICH

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:51.501
BY THE WAY AS A BENEFIT TO THE

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.003
PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY BECAUSE IT

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:54.905
MOVES TRAFFIC.

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:56.673
I OUT OF THE DANTE BLAMES THAT'S

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.041
PRIORITIZATION.

00:52:58.108 --> 00:52:59.242
THE QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:00.844
THAT'S FAIR OR DO YOU THINK THAT

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.546
THAT'S NOT FAIR BECAUSE IF YOU

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.281
IF YOU OPPOSE THAT THEN YOU'RE A

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:05.916
FAN OF BRIDGE NEUTRALITY.

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:07.584
AND IF YOU THINK THAT IT'S FAIR

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:08.752
TO CHARGE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR

00:53:08.818 --> 00:53:09.753
DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEHICLES THEY

00:53:09.819 --> 00:53:10.754
ON YOUR OPPONENT A BRIDGE

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.622
NEUTRALITY.

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:13.223
AND I THINK THAT REALLY BRINGS

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:14.891
IT HOME TO PEOPLE.

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:16.026
IN WHAT WHAT WHAT'S AT STAKE

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.894
HERE THAT AND I KNOW THAT.

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:19.563
SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL WE KNOW

00:53:19.629 --> 00:53:21.064
WHAT WHAT HAPPENS BRIDGE COMPANY

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:21.765
HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:23.066
IMPACT.

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:24.601
OVER WHAT KIND OF VEHICLES

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:26.670
TRANSIT THE BRIDGE I IT'S NOT

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:27.938
FAIR THEY THEY COULD TOTALLY

00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:29.005
PREVENT CERTAIN TYPES OF

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:29.539
VEHICLES FROM CROSSING THE

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:30.707
BRIDGE.

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:31.641
YOU KNOW AS AT A FAIR THING EVEN

00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:32.709
ON THE BRIDGE COMPANY HASN'T

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.177
TALKED ABOUT DOING THAT.

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:35.679
AND THE SOLUTION TO THAT.

00:53:35.745 --> 00:53:38.248
IS TO BUILD MORE BRIDGES.

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:38.882
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT IS WE

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:39.983
WANT LOTS OF BRIDGES WE WANT

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.084
LOTS OF INTERNET SERVICE

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.285
PROVIDERS PROVIDING DATA TO

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:43.320
PEOPLE IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.554
AND THE MORE.

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:46.623
REGULATION THAT WE LYER ON TOP

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:47.724
OF THE ACT OF PROVIDING THAT

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.359
SERVICE TO PEOPLE THE FEWER

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:50.727
BRIDGES WE GET.

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:53.029
AND NOT THE MORE BRIDGES WE GET.

00:53:53.096 --> 00:53:53.597
AND I ALSO WANT TO MAKE THE

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:55.732
POINT THAT.

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.233
IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WE

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.268
WOULD DON'T WANT ANTI

00:53:58.335 --> 00:53:58.835
COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR ON THE

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:00.704
INTERNET.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:01.771
AND I THINK THAT WE WILL ALL BE

00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:04.240
UNANIMOUS IN OUR OPINION ON THAT.

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:05.675
HOWEVER WE DO ALREADY HAVE RULES

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:07.344
IN PLACE.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.345
THAT PROHIBIT THAT TYPES OF

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:09.779
BEHAVIOR.

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:11.047
WE HAVE RULES THAT ARE ANTI

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:11.982
TRUST AND FORCED THE FEDERAL

00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:14.517
LEVEL WE HAVE RULES AGAINST ANTI

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:15.719
COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR THAT WERE

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.354
FORCED BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.356
AND AT THE STATE LEVEL.

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:20.957
AND I WOULD SAY THAT ANY.

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:21.925
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER THAT

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:23.893
HAD THE TEMERITY TO DO SOMETHING

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.462
LIKE PROHIBITING SOMEONE FOR

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:27.430
VISITING A WEBSITE.

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:29.499
WOULD INSTANTLY BE FACED WITH A

00:54:29.566 --> 00:54:30.967
CEASE AND DESIST ORDER FROM ONE

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:31.468
OF THOSE AGENCIES IF NOT

00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:32.936
MULTIPLE AGENCIES.

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:33.803
AND THERE'S A TRACK RECORD OF

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.572
THIS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:36.172
BEEN DOCUMENTED ABUSES IN THE

00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:37.974
PAST.

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:38.541
I MOST OF THOSE HAVE COME TO

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:39.676
LIGHT.

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:41.444
BECAUSE THE FCC TOOK ACTION

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.345
AGAINST THOSE COMPANIES BY THE

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:43.947
WAY A LOT OF THE ONES THAT WE

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.081
WERE TAUGHT THAT WERE TALKED

00:54:45.148 --> 00:54:46.516
ABOUT IN THE PRESENTATION.

00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:50.353
ARE OCCURRED BEFORE THE TWO

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.287
THOUSAND TEN FCC NET NEUTRALITY

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:53.289
ORDER SO THE FCC WAS ALREADY ON

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:54.658
THE JOB AND ALREADY WAS

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:55.191
PROHIBITING THOSE KINDS OF

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:56.626
BEHAVIOR.

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:58.161
ARE YOU KNOW THE REAL PROBLEM

00:54:58.228 --> 00:54:59.295
THAT I HAVE THAT NEUTRALITY IS

00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:00.897
THIS EVERY TIME THAT WE TRY TO

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.832
MAKE IT.

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:04.401
LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THE EIGHTEEN

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.302
WHEELERS ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:07.570
BY DEFINITION WE'RE MAKING IT

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:09.205
MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE PEOPLE AT

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:10.507
HONDA CIVICS ACROSS THE BRIDGE

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:11.274
AND MOST OF US DRIVE HONDA

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.276
CIVICS.

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:14.044
SO.

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:15.178
THE BREAK THE THE INTERNET

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:16.046
SERVICE PROVIDERS THEY HAVE A

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:17.647
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FIXED COST OF

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.015
DOING BUSINESS IN PROVIDING THE

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:20.617
SERVICE THAT THEY DO.

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:21.418
AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:23.086
RECOVER THOSE COSTS OR GO OUT OF

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:25.021
BUSINESS AND IF WE PROHIBIT THEM

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.423
FROM CHARGING CERTAIN TRAFFIC

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:27.257
MORE.

00:55:27.323 --> 00:55:28.792
AND PRIORITIZING CERTAIN TRAFFIC

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:30.794
DOWN ALL THE TRAFFIC IS GOING TO

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.028
GET MORE EXPENSIVE SO AFTER

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:14.851
TO BE THE SAME AS IT IS IN YOUR

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:16.185
BILL AND THEN THERE ARE

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:18.254
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:18.554
[inaudible]

00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:20.556
JUST BEING.

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:21.591
YOUR ORIGINAL BILL THIS BEING

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:22.725
THE AMENDED VERSION.

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:24.027
I THAT SEEM TO GO BEYOND

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:25.094
WHATEVER THE A BOMB ORDER HAD

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:27.330
DONE -- AND

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:29.098
I THINK THAT.

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:33.002
YOU KNOW I I I I I WAS INTRIGUED

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:34.570
BY THE COMMITTEES ORIGINAL.

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:35.972
APROPOS PROPOSAL TO JUST

00:59:36.039 --> 00:59:37.874
REFERENCE YEARS FIFTH TWENTY

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:38.875
FIFTEEN ORDER I UNDERSTAND THE

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:40.076
COMPLEXITIES WITH DOING THAT

00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:41.577
ESPECIALLY BEING A LAW THAT NO

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:42.078
LONGER.

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:43.246
EXISTS --

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:44.280
AND I APPRECIATE THAT RESPECT

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.615
THAT BUT I THINK WHAT A LOT OF

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:46.749
MEMBERS YOU'RE GONNA FACE MOVING

00:59:46.816 --> 00:59:47.617
FORWARD.

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:49.385
IS IS THAT.

00:59:49.452 --> 00:59:50.420
A I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE

00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:51.988
FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO UNDO THE

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:52.522
ACTIONS OF PREVIOUS POLICY

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:53.056
COMMITTEE.

00:59:53.122 --> 00:59:54.123
I REGARDLESS OF HOW THOSE

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:55.925
CHANGES HAPPEN.

00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:57.560
I BUT I THINK MOVING FOR THE

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:59.429
CONCERN IT'S GONNA BE IS WHAT

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.230
DID WHAT WAS THE INTENT AND THE

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:02.565
HEART OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN A

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:03.833
BOMB ORDER.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.168
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE AT

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:06.636
LEAST CODIFYING INTO LAW OF

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:07.704
THOSE SAME [inaudible]

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.173
PROVISIONS NOTHING MORE NOTHING

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:12.608
LESS -- AND

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:13.910
THERE BEEN A DISAGREEMENTS THERE

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:14.677
HAVE BEEN THINGS THAT WERE

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:15.678
PROPOSED FOR THE TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:17.080
ORDER THAT.

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:18.047
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TRIED

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:19.949
DECIDED TO TAKE PASS ON SOME OF

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:21.017
ARGUED THAT THOSE WERE ORIGINAL

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:22.118
IN YOUR ORIGINAL VERSION OF YOUR

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:24.620
BILL OTHERS.

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:26.022
NOW THE PROPONENTS SAY AREN'T --

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:29.325
BUT I THINK.

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:30.526
MOVING FORWARD BUT IT'S GOING TO

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.662
BE REALLY VITAL IS THAT WE

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:34.230
UNDERSTAND.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.066
THAT WHATEVER WE MOVE UPON AND

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.535
WHATEVER WE TAKE ACTION ON IS.

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.704
IT LEAST AND ITS FORM ACT

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:42.805
CURRENT FORM REGARDLESS OF HOW

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.774
WE SEE IT IS A MIRROR IMAGE OF

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.309
WHAT THE OBAMA ORDER WAS AND I

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.276
THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:48.778
IMPORTANT --

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:50.179
FOR MYSELF AND OTHER MEMBERS

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:50.980
CONTINUE SUPPORT --

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:53.449
BAN.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:55.018
WHAT I WILL SAY THAT WAS YOU

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:56.619
KNOW FOR THOSE THAT REPRESENT

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.755
THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL?

01:00:58.821 --> 01:00:59.956
YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THIS POSITION

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.290
AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:02.859
ARGUMENT OF I DON'T WANT A

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:04.360
PATCHWORK.

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:05.828
OF DIFFERENT STATES PASSING

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.363
DIFFERENT REGULATIONS THAT WE

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.164
HAVE TO BE COMPLYING WITH AND

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:09.298
HOW THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.133
IMPLEMENT THE INTERNET AS A

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:11.000
PROVIDER.

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:12.435
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT I I

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.604
GET THAT BUT WHAT DID YOU DO TO

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:16.472
PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:17.673
WHEN IT WAS ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.709
WHAT DID YOU DO?

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:20.543
DID YOU ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.545
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE RE

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:23.913
CLASSIFICATION AND WHO YOU WERE.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.449
WHO YOU WERE BEING REGULATED BY?

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.117
OR DID YOU FIGHT TO STOP AND

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:29.018
PREVENT IT FROM EVER HAPPENING

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:30.853
BECAUSE YOU SHOULD HAVE.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.821
BECAUSE IF THAT HAD NEVER BEEN

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:32.889
REPEALED WE NEVER WOULD HAVE

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:34.424
BEEN IN THE POSITION THAT WE ARE

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.825
TODAY WHERE WE AS A STATE.

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:37.326
NOW HAVE TO ACT ON WHAT YOU

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:39.996
CLASSIFY A FEDERALLY PRINT ISSUE --

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:42.165
WE VERY MUCH AS A FIFTH LARGEST

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:43.599
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD SHOULD HAVE

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.401
A SAY IN WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:45.668
INTERNET.

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.837
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.005
AND WHAT WE DO DOESN'T SERVE

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:50.306
JUST AS A NATIONAL MODEL SERVES

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.075
AS AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL SO WE

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.309
VERY MUCH TAKE THE COMPLETE

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.344
MCKAY IMPLEMENTATION THAT.

01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:58.014
THE THE THE THE IMPLICATIONS OF

01:01:58.081 --> 01:01:59.782
WHAT WE DO EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY.

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:00.917
BUT IN THE FUTURE I THINK WHAT

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:02.151
FRUSTRATES MYSELF IN MY OTHER

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:03.753
COLLEAGUES IS THAT.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:04.821
THINGS WILL HAPPEN ON THE

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:05.988
FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:07.557
WILL TRY TO RESTORE THAT BECAUSE

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:08.624
WE APPRECIATE THEM THE

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.993
PROTECTIONS AND IN THE STATE OF

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.595
CALIFORNIA BUT YET.

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:15.765
WHAT WAS DONE ON YOUR AND? TO

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:16.365
KEEP US FROM EVER GETTING TO

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.567
THIS POINT.

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:19.368
TRUMP'S FIGHTING AGAINST THE AS

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:20.036
A PROVIDER FROM SAYING YOU KNOW

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:20.670
WHAT.

01:02:20.736 --> 01:02:21.704
I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:22.872
FROM THE WE NEED TO KEEP THINGS

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:23.940
THE WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THIS

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:24.941
IS WHAT WORKS AND IT'S GONNA

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.375
CAUSE A HEADACHE FOR US BECAUSE

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:27.510
EVERY STATES WANT TO IMPLEMENT

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.112
THEIR OWN POLICY.

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:29.712
I THINK THAT THAT --

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:32.115
YOU CAN GO BACK --

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:33.316
BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:33.983
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:35.084
INTO CONSIDERATION MOVING

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:36.719
FORWARD BECAUSE IT PUTS US ALL

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.754
IN A POSITION WHERE NOW TRYING

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.022
TO RE LITIGATE AN ISSUE THAT

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.290
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED.

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:42.825
IT WAS ALREADY SETTLED ON THE

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.026
FOUNDED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL --

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.896
AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.431
SURE WE PROVIDE OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:49.499
WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:50.800
DESERVE AND THAT YOU KNOW THERE

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:51.701
IS NO.

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:52.869
NOBODY THAT HAS ANY ADVANTAGE

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.705
OVER ANOTHER I MEAN.

01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:57.840
SO I THINK THAT ON THE PROPONENT

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.175
SIDE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:00.209
SURE THAT WE ARE.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.844
AS TRUE TO THAT A BOMB ORDER AS

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.279
WE POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKE SURE WE

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:04.780
GET SOMETHING TO THE GOVERNOR.

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.482
BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME I

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.017
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THE CONCERNS

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.552
OF THE OPPOSITION HOUSE I WILL

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:10.586
BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL TODAY

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:12.355
THOUGH IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:15.458
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MISS

BEFORE I IT GIVE MY COMMENTS I

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.565
DID WANT TO SAY THAT FOR THIS

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:23.766
VILLAGE AND THE FREEWAY IN THE

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.469
BRIDGE.

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.539
IF THE VILLAGE AND THE RIVER AND

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:32.208

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.812
IMPORTANT FOR ME.

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:38.814

THIS BILL.

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.236
BECAUSE I DON'T ACTUALITY

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:09.171
PROTECTIONS WERE REPEALED GOT

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.473
GAS AND SO THERE IS THIS

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:11.440
QUESTION ABOUT THE COMMITTEE

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:12.475
AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD SAID WELL

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:13.676
LET'S JUST REFERENCE --

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.411
THAT ORDER --

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:16.545
SO.

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:18.080
UNDER THAT WOULD WIN THAT THAT

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:19.715
ORDER WAS STILL IN PLACE --

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:21.784
HOW IS A COMPANY OR AN ISP TO GO

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:22.985
ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHAT ITS

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:24.253
OBLIGATIONS WERE?

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.955
WELL OF COURSE THE FCC WITH THE

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.556
REGULATOR AND AND SPEAKING OF

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.659
WHETHER WE'RE GOING UP TO THE

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:30.826
TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER BEYOND ONE

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:32.328
THING WE DID NOT DO.

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:34.930
IN THIS BILL IS RECLASSIFY EYES

01:05:34.997 --> 01:05:37.066
PEAS AS PUBLIC UTILITIES THE

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:39.235
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID THAT

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:39.869
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS TO

01:05:39.935 --> 01:05:41.337
BE HEEDED.

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:42.505
THE MOST OF EVERYTHING WE'RE NOT

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:44.006
DOING THAT HERE SO IN THAT

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.474
RESPECT WE YOU KNOW IT IT

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:46.976
DOESN'T EVEN TALK TO ANNOUNCE A

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:48.444
NO ONE HAS BEEN ASKING.

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:49.945
US FOR THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.480
WANT TO SEE IF YOU SEE OUGHT TO

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:54.150
BE IN CHARGE AND THAT'S ITS OWN

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:55.818
SEPARATE A DYNAMIC --

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.453
SO -- HIGH

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.255
BUT THE F. C. C. OF COURSE WOULD

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:00.856
BE THE QUOTE WAS THE GLOBAL

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:02.291
UTILITY STYLE.

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:05.961
OUR REGULATOR AND IT BECOMES.

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:07.296
INNOVATIVE BAY THAT ARE AT THE

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:08.931
PROCESS IN TERMS OF HOW THE

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.466
REGULATION OVERSIGHT.

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.468
OCCURRED SO SO EVEN THOUGH WE

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:14.904
HAVE WORKED VERY HARD.

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:17.707
TO AYE STAY FAITHFUL TO TWENTY

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:18.074
FIFTEEN ORDER.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.709
PUTTING ASIDE THAT ULTIMATELY

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:21.243
IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING CONSUMERS

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.379
AND ECONOMY NOT A NOT ABOUT

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.481
WHETHER YOU'RE EXACTLY PERFECTLY

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:26.649
LINE FOR LINE.

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.050
OF WITH THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:30.953
BUT WE DID WORK.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.855
NOR A COMMENT ON THAT.

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:34.490
WHEN I CLOSE ABOUT HOW WE

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:36.859
BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT --

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:39.161
pTHE SAME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THE

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:41.597
FCC IN THE FCC REGULATES IN A

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.632
DIFFERENT WAY THAN WE DO OF

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:44.800
LEGISLATIVE LIKE --

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.736
SO WE I AM AGAIN WITH THAT

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.003
PERSON THEN WE APPRECIATE THE

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.905
SPIRIT OF IT WE JUST DON'T THINK

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:51.440
IT WORKS LOGISTICALLY.

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:52.808
ITEMS PASS HERE ARE A STATE

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:55.077
LEVEL BILL THAT CAN BE

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:56.145
IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED.

01:06:56.212 --> 01:06:57.980
SO EVEN IF IT WASN'T ENTIRELY

01:06:58.047 --> 01:06:59.148
WORKABLE DO YOU THINK THAT IF

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.750
THAT AMENDMENT WERE ADOPTED AT

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:02.051
THAT POINT IT WOULD BE A REAL

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.486
NET NEUTRALITY BELLER WOULD

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:04.387
STILL BE AN END OF TRIAL AND

01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:04.820
BILLING NAME ONLY.

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.756
I I I I I THINK IF WE HAVE A

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:07.857
BILL THAT.

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:10.493
THAT DOES EVERYTHING THAT TWENTY

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:11.127
FIFTEEN ORDER.

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.529
DID AND YES THAT WOULD BE A

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:14.897
STRONG NET NEUTRALITY BILL.

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:17.133
WHAT CAME OUT OF COMMITTEE LAST

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:18.934
WEEK DOES NOT MEET THAT?

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.102
A STANDARD WHAT WE PROPOSED I

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:21.804
DID IDEALLY THE FCC WERE

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.939
REALIZED EMITTER WILL MISTAKEN

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:25.508
REINSTATE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:27.410
ORDER AND THAT THEY WILL BE.

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:28.010
MUCH MORE PEACE AND HARMONY ON

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.846
EARTH.

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:32.681
WE CAN ALL HOPE FOR THAT --

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:33.983
THE PEACE AND HARMONY PART --

01:07:34.049 --> 01:07:36.919
SO I I DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT.

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:37.486
THE POINTS RAISED BY THE

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:38.921
OPPOSITION THEY MOLESTED OFF A

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:41.223
FEW THINGS LIKE A ZERO RATING IN

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.958
OUR CONNECTIONS --

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:45.828
PROCUREMENT AND I THINK THAT

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.564
THOSE ITEMS I GO BEYOND WHAT THE

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:49.198

OF INTERCONNECTION.

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.953
SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THE AMOUNT

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.200
WAS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:25.367
THAT YOU CAN'T USE IN OUR

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:28.137

01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:29.238
WHAT IS I MEAN.

TRANSLATE THE ORDER INTO LAW.

01:16:07.562 --> 01:16:09.698
I WHEN YOU DON'T WANT THE

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:11.266
REGULATORY AGENCY TO DEAL WITH

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.302
THIS KIND OF STUFF.

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:15.637
SO ONE OF THE BIG MARCHING

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:17.606
ORDERS FOR THIS BILL WERE WE DO

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:19.541
NOT WANT A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:20.876
UTILITIES COMMISSION TO HAVE

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:22.444
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.413
AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:27.783
LOOK GUYS I AM NOT A REGULATED.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.455
WHAT ALL THESE THINGS MEAN.

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:36.124
SO TO THE EXTENT PLEASE THAT YOU

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:38.493

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.128

I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE DOT.

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:45.567
AND SO IN THAT SENSE.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.003
THE BILL IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.238
DOES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:52.174
ON ZERO RATING THAT IS MODELED

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.475

IN SOME RESPECTS THAN THE FCC

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:07.656
BECAUSE AND AGAIN IT WOULD BE

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:10.192
EASIER IF WE JUST GAVE IT ALL

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:10.826
AND CENTER DALY OWNS ORIGINAL

01:17:10.892 --> 01:17:11.727
BILL.

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.395
A HIS ORIGINAL VERSION THAT DOES

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.764
IT DOES SAID THAT THE CPC'S HAVE

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:17.299

REGULATOR.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.138
NO ONE WANTED THAT ON EITHER

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:25.240
SIDE THE PROPONENTS OF WHAT

THAT WAS THE ONE AREA OF COMMON

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:29.711
GROUND --

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.780
AND SO THAT WAS TAKEN OUT SO AS

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:32.647
A RESULT --

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:36.618
WERE BECAUSE IT IS BEING --

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:38.220

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:39.955
PRETTY UNIVERSALLY EMBRACED IN

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.490

THE FCC WAS BEGINNING

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:54.836
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AROUND ZERO

01:17:54.903 --> 01:17:55.737

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:45.079
POSSIBLE POSSIBLE PATH FORWARD.

AYE INDIANAPOLIS'S WE AUTHORED

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:48.149
THE CONSIDER.

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:49.551
ON IF HE CHOOSES TO IN THE

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:51.419
FUTURE.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:52.987
IT IS ALSO MY BELIEVE THAT THESE

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:54.355
AMENDMENTS WOULD ACCOMPLISH OF

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:56.524
BOTH WHAT THE AUTHOR SEEKS TO

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.092
ACCOMPLISH YA AND ALSO WHAT THE

01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.727
PROPONENTS HAVE ASKED.

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:01.796
NAMELY TO ADHERE TO THE TWENTY

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.598
FIFTEEN FCC ORDER.

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:05.800
OUR TO ITS FULLEST EXTENT.

01:25:05.867 --> 01:25:07.902

THE DIRECTION OF THE LAST

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:09.437
COMMITTEE.

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:11.072
AND THE DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:13.174
THE BILL DOES NOT GO FURTHER

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:15.210
THAN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER.

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:17.045
I THINK ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:18.513
THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS --

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:20.849
HIS THAT THEY TENDER REMOVE THE

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:23.618
NEED. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY

01:25:23.685 --> 01:25:25.887
TO SYNTHESIZE A LARGE REGULATORY

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:28.957
DOCUMENT THAT IS HOLY REFLECTIVE.

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:32.060
OF THE FCC SELL FOR ACTION.

MUCH STAKEHOLDERS MAY DISAGREE

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:39.734
AS WE HAVE SEEN HERE TODAY.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:41.236
AS TO WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.805
INCLUDED IN THE FCC ORDER.

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:46.007
ARM WHEN I ENGAGE IN A SIMILAR

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:48.009
AND HARD FIGHT THAT BATTLE TO

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:48.743
PROTECT PRIVACY RIGHTS OF

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.311
CONSUMERS.

01:25:50.378 --> 01:25:51.813
A WHOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION IS

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.148
COLLECTED AND SOLD BY BUSINESSES.

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:55.083
A PROTECTIONS WHICH WERE

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:56.651
SIMILARLY ROLLBACK --

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:57.986

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS MY

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.981

IN ROUTINE POLICE SURVEILLANCE.

COME IN THE FUTURE.

01:43:55.762 --> 01:43:57.364
WE TALKED ABOUT ONE OF THE

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.616
AND THE COURTS HAVE BEEN THE THE

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:52.019
BODY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY COME

01:44:52.085 --> 01:44:53.720
TO SET THE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:56.423
IN PLACE FOR OUR USE --

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:57.691
FOR EXAMPLE I CANNOT COME PARK

01:44:57.758 --> 01:44:58.925
OUTSIDE SOMEONE IF I WAS LAW

01:44:58.992 --> 01:45:00.494
ENFORCEMENT CAN'T COMPARTO PARK

THERMAL RADAR AND FIND OUT WHERE

01:45:03.897 --> 01:45:04.498
THEY ARE INSIDE THE HOUSE

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:05.432
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:06.967
I CAN'T VIOLATE THEIR PRIVACY

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:07.868
JUST BECAUSE I HAVE SOME

01:45:07.934 --> 01:45:09.503
TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD DO IT.

01:45:09.569 --> 01:45:10.637
THERE ARE LIMITS IN PLACE IN THE

01:45:10.704 --> 01:45:11.905
COURTS OF SET THOSE LIMBS AND

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:13.940
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:15.876
CONCERNS BECAUSE THE COURTS

01:45:15.942 --> 01:45:16.476
AREN'T ALWAYS AWARE OF WHAT WE

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:16.877
HAVE.

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.912
AND SO IF THIS IS.

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:20.881
THE ISSUE IS NOT ABOUT.

01:45:20.947 --> 01:45:22.149
US DISCLOSING WHAT TYPES OF

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:23.216
TECHNOLOGY IN SURVEILLANCE WERE

01:45:23.283 --> 01:45:24.451
HAVING THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:25.619
CAN HAVE BUT THERE A LOT OF

01:45:25.686 --> 01:45:26.787
PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL.

01:45:26.853 --> 01:45:28.321
THE EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCE

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:29.856
EXEMPTION IS IS RIDDLED WITH

01:45:29.923 --> 01:45:31.224
PROBLEMS.

01:45:31.291 --> 01:45:33.126
IT'S IS THE WEEKENDS ONLY USE

01:45:33.193 --> 01:45:34.561
WHATEVER TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRE

01:45:34.628 --> 01:45:36.296
FOR THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:37.764
WHICH I MEAN THESE ARE SOMETIMES

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:38.965
VERY EXPENSIVE PIECES OF

01:45:39.032 --> 01:45:40.200
TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU CAN'T JUST

01:45:40.267 --> 01:45:41.468

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:44.004
FOR A FEW DAYS JUST YOU KNOW.

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:45.472

INCOME GIVE IT RIGHT BACK I MEAN

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.674

NORDSTROM'S --

PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY.

01:45:58.351 --> 01:45:59.052
BECAUSE IT THERE WAS A

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:00.087
KIDNAPPING I'M LOOKING FOR

01:46:00.153 --> 01:46:01.588

01:46:10.797 --> 01:46:12.499
DOES NOT ALLOW ITS TO HOLD.

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:13.400
THE BILL SAYS ONLY [inaudible]

01:46:13.467 --> 01:46:16.503
A INFORMATION RELATED TO THAT

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:17.537
EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCE CAN BE

CIRCUMSTANCE.

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:25.879
SO AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:27.814
JUST TECHNOLOGY CAN PURCHASE FOR

01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:28.415

ISSUE WITH A BROAD BRUSH SO WE

01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:29.322
DIDN'T HAVE TO COME BACK.

01:50:29.389 --> 01:50:31.524
INTERPRETED REINTERPRETED

01:50:31.591 --> 01:50:32.025
EVERYTIME WE'VE GOT NEW

01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:33.126
TECHNOLOGY.

01:50:33.193 --> 01:50:33.827
RELEASED BUT I'M AFRAID THAT

01:50:33.893 --> 01:50:36.896
WERE CAPTURED.

01:50:36.963 --> 01:50:38.765
PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT AND SAY --

01:50:38.832 --> 01:50:39.699
YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT IS A

01:50:39.766 --> 01:50:40.800
REASONABLE USE OF TECHNOLOGY HOW

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:42.068
WE ARE TO BE COUPLE EXAMPLES OF

01:50:42.135 --> 01:50:42.969
IF SOMEONE.

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:44.838
I'VE TAKES A PICTURE OF A PERSON

01:50:44.904 --> 01:50:47.140
IN A BATHROOM STALL WE WE WE THE

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:48.108
COURTS HAVE RULED WE CAN WE ALL

01:50:48.174 --> 01:50:48.708
AGREE.

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:50.210
THAT THAT IN A BATHROOM STALL

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:51.745
YOU HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:53.813
PRIVACY IF SOMEONE TAKES A

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:54.414
PICTURE OF YOU WALKING INTO A

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:55.548
RESTAURANT.

01:50:55.615 --> 01:50:56.583
I THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY NO

01:50:56.649 --> 01:50:57.584
YOU DON'T HAVE A REASONABLE

01:50:57.650 --> 01:50:58.818
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY THERE

01:50:58.885 --> 01:51:00.487
YOUR CARS IN THE PARKING LOT OF

01:51:00.553 --> 01:51:02.355
MANY PEOPLE SAW YOU WALK IN

01:51:02.422 --> 01:51:03.289
THERE PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:04.657
THE TO SING DOWN EATING THEIR

01:51:04.724 --> 01:51:04.891
DINNER.

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:06.693
THAT SAW YOU SIT DOWN --

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.594
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT

01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:08.461
REASONABLE FOR YOU TO EXPECT

01:51:08.528 --> 01:51:09.896
THAT THE FACT THAT YOU WERE

01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:10.997
THERE.

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:12.866
IS NOT PUBLIC INFORMATION SO

01:51:12.932 --> 01:51:13.833
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A TECHNOLOGY

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.301
THAT PUTS A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:18.238
ON A A STREET LAMP FOR EXAMPLE.

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:19.439
AND PERHAPS USES FACIAL

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:21.408
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:22.342
RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE WALKING

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:24.077
INTO A RESTAURANT I DON'T HAVE A

01:51:24.144 --> 01:51:24.778
PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE I

01:51:24.844 --> 01:51:25.712
DON'T THINK YOU HAD.

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:26.780
A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF

01:51:26.846 --> 01:51:28.114
PRIVACY IN THE FIRST PLACE IN

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:29.916
THAT SITUATION SO THE QUESTION

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:31.084
IS I MEAN WHAT.

01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:32.052
I TELL ME THAT I'M WRONG THERE

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:34.254
TELL ME WHY ASH I I SHOULD HAVE

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.588
AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY.

01:51:35.655 --> 01:51:36.923
WHEN THERE ARE MANY OTHER FORMS

01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:38.191
OF LESS TECHNOLOGICALLY

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:40.326
SOPHISTICATED SURVEILLANCE THAT

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:40.794
WOULD REVEAL THE SAME

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:42.595
INFORMATION I GUESS IF I COULD

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:44.064
MISTER CHAIR THROUGH A THROUGH

01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:45.698
THE CHAIR ON THIS THIS?

01:51:45.765 --> 01:51:46.366
THIS ISSUE I THINK THE

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:47.901
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IS NOT

01:51:47.967 --> 01:51:48.935
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:50.003
STREET IN THAT CAMERA THAT BLUE

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:51.271
LIGHT THAT YOU SEE DOWN THE

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:52.705
STREET HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

01:51:52.772 --> 01:51:54.040
IS TAKING A PICTURE OF YOU BUT

01:51:54.107 --> 01:51:55.575
IT'S WHEN THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:56.810
THEN THE ONE AT THE NEXT CORNER

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:58.244
TAKEN THE NEXT CORNER TODAY AND

01:51:58.311 --> 01:51:59.946
FIND WHERE YOU PARK YOUR CAR

01:52:00.013 --> 01:52:00.814
WHERE YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.015
TAKE YOUR FACIAL RECOGNITION

01:52:02.082 --> 01:52:03.516
WHAT YOU GOING TO THE STORE.

01:52:03.583 --> 01:52:04.951
COME OUT THEN TAKE YOUR PICTURE

01:52:05.018 --> 01:52:06.986
DOWN THE STREET AND AND HAS A UP

01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:08.988
A MAP OF WHERE YOU SPEND YOUR

01:52:09.055 --> 01:52:09.889
LIFE.

01:52:09.956 --> 01:52:10.924
THEN THEY CAN USE THAT

01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:12.459
INFORMATION FOR HOWEVER THEY

01:52:12.525 --> 01:52:14.094
WANT TO USE IT THAT'S THE

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.595
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY HAVE WHEN

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:16.296
WHEN YOU'RE.

01:52:16.362 --> 01:52:18.631
IT JUST IS GPS USE IS NOT FOR A

01:52:18.698 --> 01:52:20.934
LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLLOW YOU INTO

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.535
TRACK WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

01:52:22.602 --> 01:52:24.070
THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE WHEN THEY

01:52:24.137 --> 01:52:25.638
USE THAT INFORMATION AND THAT'S

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:27.273
WHY THE POLICIES IMPORTANT HOW

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:29.109
THE UC INFORMATION HOW LONG THEY

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:30.910
KEEP THAT INFORMATION WHO HAS

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:32.645
ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION AS WE

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:33.646
SAW WITH LICENSE PLATE READERS

01:52:33.713 --> 01:52:35.115
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST BASIC

01:52:35.181 --> 01:52:35.982
FORM.

01:52:36.049 --> 01:52:37.383
OF THAT TYPE OF SURVEILLANCE

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:39.052
BECAUSE IT GETS YOUR VEHICLE AS

01:52:39.119 --> 01:52:40.787
IT DID WHEN I GAVE A PRIVATE

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:42.422
INVESTIGATOR MY WIFE LICENSE

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:43.089
PLATE NUMBER AND SURE ENOUGH THE

01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:44.157
FOUNDER.

01:52:44.224 --> 01:52:46.059
CAR WHERE SHE GOES APPEARED AT A

01:52:46.126 --> 01:52:47.827
GYM ON WEDNESDAY SO I MEAN IT

01:52:47.894 --> 01:52:49.796
CAN BE TRACKED AND USED IN A WAY

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:50.730
THAT IS.

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:52.332
IS NOT WHAT WE WOULD WANT LAW

01:52:52.398 --> 01:52:53.733
ENFORCEMENT TO USE IT FOR NOT

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.834
THAT THEY WOULD DO IT BUT IT'S

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:56.669
JUST HOW LONG IT WOULD BE HAPPY

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:59.105
TO DO IS I'D LIKE TO ASK ASK MY

01:52:59.172 --> 01:53:00.974
WITNESS OF THEY HAVE ANOTHER.

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.175
A BIT OF INFORMATION THAT COULD

01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:03.443
I THINK THE ARGUE THAT POINT

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.811
MISTER VOTE NO TO I WOULD ONLY

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:05.712
POINT OUT THAT THE BILL DOESN'T

01:53:05.778 --> 01:53:07.614
PROHIBIT ANY KIND OF

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:08.882
SURVEILLANCE IT ALLOWS THESE

01:53:08.948 --> 01:53:10.550
DECISIONS TO BE MADE AT A LOCAL

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:11.050
LEVEL.

01:53:11.117 --> 01:53:12.552
AND IN FACT YOUR COMMUNITY MAY

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:14.521
DECIDE THAT IT WANTS TO EMBRACE

01:53:14.587 --> 01:53:16.222
ALL OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND USE

01:53:16.289 --> 01:53:17.524
IT WITHOUT LIMITATION AND THAT'S

01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:18.158
PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE UNDER THE

01:53:18.224 --> 01:53:19.893
BILL.

01:53:19.959 --> 01:53:22.495
OKAY I'D I RESPECT THE ANSWER

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:24.097
THAT WE COMPLETELY AGREE.

01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:25.098
WITH THAT WERE IN FURIOUS

01:53:25.165 --> 01:53:26.366
AGREEMENT AS EIGHT SAY --

01:53:26.432 --> 01:53:28.168
EXCEPT FOR THIS YOU KNOW I I

01:53:28.234 --> 01:53:29.936
AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S THE WAY

01:53:30.003 --> 01:53:30.470
THAT THE DATA IS THAT'S

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:33.006
AGGREGATED THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME

01:53:33.072 --> 01:53:34.307
TROUBLING PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS.

01:53:34.374 --> 01:53:35.375
THE PROBLEM IS THE WAY THAT THE

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:37.343
BILL IS WORDED THE SITUATION

01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:38.611
THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THAT WOULD

01:53:38.678 --> 01:53:40.046
BE OKAY WITH YOU THAT THE

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:40.880
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA WITH THE

01:53:40.947 --> 01:53:41.614
BLUE LIGHT.

01:53:41.681 --> 01:53:42.982
AND JUST YOU KNOW THE ONE

01:53:43.049 --> 01:53:44.017
INSTANCE IF YOU WALK INTO A

01:53:44.083 --> 01:53:45.351
RESTAURANT THAT ALSO WOULD

01:53:45.418 --> 01:53:46.619
REQUIRE DISCLOSURE.

01:53:46.686 --> 01:53:48.655
UNDER THE BILL AND SO IF IF IT'D

01:53:48.721 --> 01:53:50.190
BEEN WORDED IN A WAY THAT WAS A

01:53:50.256 --> 01:53:51.858
LITTLE BIT MORE SELECTIVE I

01:53:51.925 --> 01:53:52.492
THINK I'D BE ABLE TO GET THERE

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:55.595
BUT AFTER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED

01:53:55.662 --> 01:53:57.697
AND IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD IF

01:53:57.764 --> 01:53:58.631
IT IF IT EVER GETS NARROWED TO

01:53:58.698 --> 01:53:59.365
THE POINT WHERE.

01:53:59.432 --> 01:54:00.633
WHERE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YES

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:02.335
A REASONABLE PERSON WOULD SAY

01:54:02.402 --> 01:54:03.436
YOU DO HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:04.771
PRIVACY UNDER THE CONDITIONS

01:54:04.837 --> 01:54:06.439
WHICH COVERS ARE BE HAVING TO

01:54:06.506 --> 01:54:07.106
SWITCH OVER TO SUPPORT

01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:07.407
[inaudible]

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:09.943
THANK YOU.

THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY PERFECT

01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:23.756
OPPOSITION TO HAVE --

01:54:23.823 --> 01:54:24.724
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:25.992
JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:54:26.059 --> 01:54:28.828
AND WHAT WE WORK ON HERE --

01:54:28.895 --> 01:54:29.796
YEAH I THINK IN SUPPORT OF

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:30.997
OVERALL THE CONCEPT OF WHAT

01:54:31.064 --> 01:54:31.965
YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD I

01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:33.399

HERE IN SACRAMENTO HAT WE LIMIT.

01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:52.352
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO

01:54:52.418 --> 01:54:53.353

OUR LOCAL ON FORCE AND LIKE THE

01:54:59.058 --> 01:55:00.593
POLICE CHIEF AFTER THE CITY OF

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:01.628
WHITTIER THE ISSUE USUALLY TENDS

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:02.695
TO BE WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A SET

01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:03.863
OF RESOURCES.

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:05.732
IN ORDER TO HOT SETTLE YOUR FIX

YOUR ISSUES AND SO WHEN I MOVED

INTO A COMMUNITY IN UPTOWN

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:09.769
WHITTIER --

01:55:09.836 --> 01:55:11.371
I NAY BECOMING THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:12.639
WATCH CHASING PEOPLE DOWN OR

01:55:12.705 --> 01:55:13.172
CHASE PEOPLE OUT OF OUR

01:55:13.239 --> 01:55:14.607
COMMUNITY WITH MAG LIFE ASSET

01:55:14.674 --> 01:55:15.908
FLASHLIGHT --

01:55:15.975 --> 01:55:17.543
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NOT THE

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.479
CAPACITY FOR THAT FOR OUR LOCALS

01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:22.115
AS CITY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE

01:55:22.181 --> 01:55:22.649
ABLE TO HANDLE IT I THINK

01:55:22.715 --> 01:55:23.182
SURVEILLANCE IS.

01:55:23.249 --> 01:55:24.984
IS SOMETHING THAT ARE A LOT OF

01:55:25.051 --> 01:55:25.618
THE FOLKS WHO LIVE MY COMMUNITY

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:27.553
WOULD BE APPRECIATIVE OF WE HAVE

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:28.488
IT -- AT THE

01:55:28.554 --> 01:55:31.391
KIND OF THE WAY GETTING PART OF

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:32.925
OUR COMMUNITY WHEN WE INSTALLED

01:55:32.992 --> 01:55:33.726
THE CAMERA OUR SELVES GET THE

01:55:33.793 --> 01:55:35.228
COLLECTED INFORMATION AND SO I

01:55:35.295 --> 01:55:36.462
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:37.530
MOVE FORWARD NOT TAKING TOOLS

01:55:37.597 --> 01:55:38.097
AWAY.

01:55:38.164 --> 01:55:39.032
OFF FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.500
ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB TO KEEP US

01:55:40.566 --> 01:55:41.367
SAFE BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:42.935
FOUNDATIONS THAT WE ALL SHOULD

01:55:43.002 --> 01:55:44.771
BE UP HERE. TO TO MAINTAIN IS TO

01:55:44.837 --> 01:55:46.072
KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND PROTECTED

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:47.140
AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE LAW

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:48.741
ENFORCEMENT HAVE THE TOOLS TO TO

01:55:48.808 --> 01:55:49.676
BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:55:49.742 --> 01:55:50.576
AND THEN ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO

01:55:50.643 --> 01:55:52.011
BE ABLE TO THAT BEING ABLE TO

01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:55.348
DISCUSS INFORMATION --

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:57.417
PUBLICLY I YEAH I I THINK THAT

01:55:57.483 --> 01:55:58.751
THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE

01:55:58.818 --> 01:56:00.353
INPUT FROM THE CITY COUNCIL WHEN

01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:01.220
IT COMES TO THE DECISIONS THAT

01:56:01.287 --> 01:56:02.388
ARE BEING MADE DAILY ELECTED

01:56:02.455 --> 01:56:03.823
REPRESENTATIVES LOCALLY.

01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:05.224
ARE AND THEY SHOULD BE TRUSTED

01:56:05.291 --> 01:56:06.693
AND IF THEY CAN'T BE TRUSTED IN

01:56:06.759 --> 01:56:07.593
THEIR CHECK THAT CHANGE NEEDS TO

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.262
BE MADE AYE AND WE CAN ALWAYS BE

01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:10.263
THE ONES MAKING THAT CHANGE FOR

01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:11.097
THEM --

01:56:11.164 --> 01:56:12.632
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:15.468
SOMETIMES IT'S BAD NONE THE LESS

01:56:15.535 --> 01:56:16.402
WERE ALWAYS TAKEN --

01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:17.603
THE NONSENSE FOR IT --

01:56:17.670 --> 01:56:19.972
BUT I TIMES AYE I THINK AS WE

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:20.807
MOVE FORWARD.

01:56:20.873 --> 01:56:22.375
I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT IN

01:56:22.442 --> 01:56:23.643
WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:25.111
SEE IF THERE ARE TIMES WHERE A

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:26.946
CONVERSATION ARE NOT IN THE

01:56:27.013 --> 01:56:27.780
PUBLIC SPHERE.

01:56:27.847 --> 01:56:29.115
IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT

01:56:29.182 --> 01:56:31.250
DETERMINATION TO BE MADE.

01:56:31.317 --> 01:56:31.818
BY THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

01:56:31.884 --> 01:56:33.052
BECAUSE IT.

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:34.854
IT IN CONCEPT YOU ARE SPEAKING

01:56:34.921 --> 01:56:37.190
TO THE THE THE PUBLIC WHEN YOU

01:56:37.256 --> 01:56:38.224
ARE SPEAKING TO AN ELECTED

01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:39.158
OFFICIAL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:56:39.225 --> 01:56:40.093
BECAUSE THEY ARE ELECTED BY THE

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:41.728
ELECTORATE. TO TAKE CARE OF

01:56:41.794 --> 01:56:42.528
THESE TYPES OF ISSUES WAS OTHER

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:44.130
COUPLE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE

01:56:44.197 --> 01:56:45.965
IN THE THING MOVING FORWARD I'D

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:47.266
REALLY APPRECIATE ATTENTION IN

01:56:47.333 --> 01:56:49.135
ADDRESSING.

01:56:49.202 --> 01:56:50.903
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT WE'VE BEEN.

01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:52.205
BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT IN

01:56:52.271 --> 01:56:53.339
THE THE QUESTION CAME UP ABOUT

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:54.207
HAVING.

01:56:54.273 --> 01:56:55.808
THIS IN CLOSED SESSION FOR A

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:58.177
LOCAL FOR A CITY COUNCIL OR

01:56:58.244 --> 01:56:59.746
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:00.380
CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS WE KNOW

01:57:00.446 --> 01:57:01.247
WHAT THE BROWN ACT.

01:57:01.314 --> 01:57:02.081
THIS DOES NOT FIT WITHIN ONE OF

01:57:02.148 --> 01:57:05.385
THOSE -- FOR

01:57:05.451 --> 01:57:07.286
BROWN ACT CLOSED SESSION

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:09.188
CONVERSATIONS AND SO WE'RE STILL

01:57:09.255 --> 01:57:11.157
LOOKING AND TRYING TO FIND THE

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:13.059
SWEET SPOT FOR THAT AS WELL AND

01:57:13.126 --> 01:57:14.026
I AGREE WITH.

01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:15.294
WITH YOU ON ALLOWING AND AND

01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:17.263
MAKING SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:18.664
HAS THE TO HAVE THE TOOLS THAT

01:57:18.731 --> 01:57:19.499
ARE AVAILABLE.

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:20.900
THE ONLY CONDITION AND THE ONLY

01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:22.168
REASON FOR MOVING THIS AND I

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:23.436
THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE

01:57:23.503 --> 01:57:25.071
IS CONCERNED IS THAT WHICH ONE

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:26.372
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE

01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:28.374
CIVILIAN BODY MAKES THOSE

01:57:28.441 --> 01:57:30.009
DECISIONS THAT AND UNDERSTANDS

01:57:30.076 --> 01:57:31.010
AND KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE LAW

01:57:31.077 --> 01:57:32.111
ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS ARE

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:34.714
UTILIZED IN USING WHO HAS ACCESS.

01:57:34.781 --> 01:57:36.215
TO IT HOW LONG WE KEEP THE DATA

01:57:36.282 --> 01:57:37.950
WHAT WOULD CHECKS AND BALANCES

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:39.318
ARE IN PLACES THAT THERE AREN'T

01:57:39.385 --> 01:57:41.053
THE ABUSES THAT WE HEAR ABOUT

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:42.422
EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE AND

01:57:42.488 --> 01:57:42.989
CERTAINLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT%

01:57:43.055 --> 01:57:45.124
OCCURS ON A ON GOING BASIS

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:45.691
ANYWHERE.

01:57:45.758 --> 01:57:47.660
BUT IT'S THAT FEAR THAT I THINK

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:49.128
WE HAVE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:49.662
AT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:52.598
SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES THAT.

01:57:52.665 --> 01:57:53.633
THAT WE DON'T KNOW OF YET AND IN

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:55.535
WOULD YOU KNOW THAT THE THE

01:57:55.601 --> 01:57:56.969
OPPOSITION WAS TALKING ABOUT A

01:57:57.036 --> 01:57:58.504
COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT.

01:57:58.571 --> 01:57:59.338
I THOUGHT WERE WERE --

01:57:59.405 --> 01:58:00.673
INTERESTING ONE YOU KNOW

01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:04.110
MENTIONING THAT UP --

01:58:04.177 --> 01:58:04.677
IT WASN'T JUST THE ONE ISSUE

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:08.414
WHICH HAPPEN WELL ANYTHING COULD

01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:09.882
HAPPEN IN THAT IN IT'S NOT

01:58:09.949 --> 01:58:13.386
MENTIONED IN THE BILL AND IN.

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:14.020
EVERY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT TYPE

01:58:14.086 --> 01:58:15.221
OF TECH.

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:16.556
YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T MIND IT WAS

01:58:16.622 --> 01:58:17.690
LICENSE PLATE READERS FOR THEY

01:58:17.757 --> 01:58:19.091
WERE OPPOSED THERE DIDN'T

01:58:19.158 --> 01:58:20.393
SUPPORT THE BILL CERTAINLY BUT

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.527
THAT THEY WEREN'T IS.

01:58:21.594 --> 01:58:22.929
ADAMANT ABOUT IT WITH LICENSE

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:25.698
PLATE READERS OR CELL INTERCEPT

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:27.033
TECHNOLOGY.

01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:29.535
BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:31.471
A REAL FEAR AS I GUESS WOULD

01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:32.104
WOULD GETS ME GOING A LITTLE BIT

01:58:32.171 --> 01:58:32.738
IS.

01:58:32.805 --> 01:58:34.440
WHAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY DO THEY

01:58:34.507 --> 01:58:36.476
NOT WANT US TO KNOW ABOUT?

01:58:36.542 --> 01:58:38.344
AND SHOULDN'T WE KNOW ABOUT THAT

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:39.612
TECHNOLOGY.

01:58:39.679 --> 01:58:40.947
I UNDERSTAND WE WANT WE KNOW

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:42.448
WHAT THE BAD GUY TO BE ABLE TO

01:58:42.515 --> 01:58:44.884
UTILIZE CENTER NOTE BUT THEY'RE

01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:46.152
PROVIDENCE AHEAD OF US AND WHAT

01:58:46.219 --> 01:58:46.752
WE KNOW BUT THAT'S THE FEAR I

01:58:46.819 --> 01:58:47.887
HAVE.

01:58:47.954 --> 01:58:49.555
IS WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY NOW

01:58:49.622 --> 01:58:50.189
THAT THEY MAY NOT WANT US TO

01:58:50.256 --> 01:58:51.090
KNOW ABOUT.

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:52.525
THAT THEY'RE USING TO THAT COULD

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:54.060
ACTUALLY AG I'M I WAS MORE

01:58:54.126 --> 01:58:55.294
NERVOUS AFTER THE TESTIMONY

01:58:55.361 --> 01:58:58.197
TODAY THAN I WAS BEFORE.

01:58:58.264 --> 01:58:59.699

01:59:04.337 --> 01:59:06.405
OUT

01:59:06.472 --> 01:59:08.674
IT TO TO AREAS THAT I WANTED TO

01:59:08.741 --> 01:59:11.878
DISCUSS SENATOR ONE IS DE I I

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:13.679
THINK WITHOUT A DOUBT THERE HAS

01:59:13.746 --> 01:59:16.249
TO BE THIS BALANCE. OH WE DO

01:59:16.315 --> 01:59:17.216
WANT THAT.

01:59:17.283 --> 01:59:18.217
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT

01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:20.419
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY BUT WE

01:59:20.486 --> 01:59:22.088
ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT LAW

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:23.122
ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TOOLS THEY

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:25.324
NEED TO PROVIDE THAT PROTECTIONS.

01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:27.727
TO ALL OF ITS RESIDENTS --

01:59:27.793 --> 01:59:29.028
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING

01:59:29.095 --> 01:59:31.130
TOWARDS THAT AND AYE I SUPPORT

01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:32.164
YOU IN THAT.

01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:34.133
ARE THE OTHER IT HAS TO DO WITH

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:35.468
OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS.

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:36.869
ARE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:59:36.936 --> 01:59:38.738
DA AND THE SHERIFF THOSE ARE

01:59:38.804 --> 01:59:40.206
BOTH ELECTED.

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:41.974
AND THEY ARE INDEPENDENT AND TO

01:59:42.041 --> 01:59:44.410
HAVE TO HAVE THEM NOW COME

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:45.278
BEFORE THE COUNTY BOARD OF

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:47.547
SUPERVISORS.

01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:48.714
IF THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE'RE

01:59:48.781 --> 01:59:50.816
SUPPOSED TO BE --

01:59:50.883 --> 01:59:53.252
AND SO FINDING LANGUAGE THAT

01:59:53.319 --> 01:59:55.421
ALLOWS THEM THAT INDEPENDENCE

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:56.522
PRESENTING IT TO THE COUNTY

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:58.324
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AYE I THINK

01:59:58.391 --> 02:00:00.126
WOULD BE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

02:00:00.192 --> 02:00:02.962
BUT TO SEEK THEIR APPROVAL.

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:03.462
DOES NOT ALLOW THEM THE

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:05.131
INDEPENDENCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT

02:00:05.197 --> 02:00:06.499
CODE.

02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:08.000
INTENDED FOR THEMAS ELECTED

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:10.903
OFFICIALS SO THOSE ARE THE TWO

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:12.939
AREAS THAT YEAH THAT NOT ENOUGH

02:00:13.005 --> 02:00:15.041
TO CAUSE ME. TO TO VOTE AGAINST

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:17.310
IT I DO WANT THAT YOUR YOUR BILL

02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:19.478
TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I DO WANT TO

02:00:19.545 --> 02:00:20.980
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:22.882
A WATCH THAT CONVERSATION TO

02:00:22.949 --> 02:00:24.917
CONTINUE AND I'VE REALLY GOT

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.218
ESTA -- TO

02:00:26.285 --> 02:00:28.554
RAISE IT WE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN.

02:00:28.621 --> 02:00:29.488
DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND

02:00:29.555 --> 02:00:30.523
INTERPRETATIONS OF THAT

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:32.725
CERTAINLY THE THE THE THE

02:00:32.792 --> 02:00:34.160
OPINION IN THE LIST OF IN THE

02:00:34.226 --> 02:00:36.395
ANALYSIS TODAY --

02:00:36.462 --> 02:00:38.431
SURLIS CONTRARY TO WHAT WE WERE

02:00:38.497 --> 02:00:40.466
JUST TALKING ABOUT AND SO I

02:00:40.533 --> 02:00:41.934
THINK WE NEED TO TO RELIEF HAVE

02:00:42.001 --> 02:00:43.469
FINE TUNE THAT AND AND HONE IN

02:00:43.536 --> 02:00:45.571
ON THAT THAT DEFINITION AND TO

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:46.172
MAKE SURE BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY

02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:48.040
DON'T WANT --

02:00:48.107 --> 02:00:49.642
THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS SHARE FOR

02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:51.077
D. A TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

02:00:51.143 --> 02:00:52.411
THAT IS CONTRARY TO WHAT THE LAW

02:00:52.478 --> 02:00:54.447
REQUIRES THEM TO DO --

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:55.548
AND WE RESPECT THEIR

02:00:55.615 --> 02:00:57.083
INDEPENDENCE AND AND IT SHOULD

02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:59.318
BE INDEPENDENT AND SO WE WILL WE

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:01.087
WILL.

02:01:01.153 --> 02:01:02.521
LOOK AT THAT A LOT CLOSER IN THE

02:01:02.588 --> 02:01:04.023
NEXT -- IF

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:04.790
THE BILL MOVES TODAY ROOM TO

02:01:04.857 --> 02:01:06.626
MAKE SURE THAT'S PART OF THAT

02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:08.594
CONVERSATION THANK YOU SENATOR.

02:01:08.661 --> 02:01:09.662
RESERVOIR.

02:01:09.729 --> 02:01:11.097
YES I AM VOTED ON THIS BILL I

02:01:11.163 --> 02:01:13.165
THINK WAS TWO YEARS AGO AND AT

02:01:13.232 --> 02:01:14.533
THAT TIME THERE HAD BEEN A

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:16.435
NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TAKEN

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:17.536
INCLUDING I BELIEVE THAT THE

02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:19.338
SHERIFFS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT AND

02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:21.574
AND I DO AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:22.842
MEMBER RAY HAS SAID.

02:01:22.908 --> 02:01:24.110
THEY ARE US.

CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS.

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:30.950
AND I DON'T THINK IT IS FOR ME

02:01:31.017 --> 02:01:33.119
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE THAT THEY

02:01:33.185 --> 02:01:34.253
HAVE TO GO IN FRONT OF THE BOARD

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.988
OF SUPERVISORS SO.

02:01:36.055 --> 02:01:37.957
I THINK THIS IS THAT BALANCE

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:38.624
THAT -- A

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:40.393
NUMBER OF MEMBERS HAVE MENTIONED

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:42.628

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:44.597
SHERIFF'S.

02:01:44.664 --> 02:01:45.464
DAYS ARE --

02:01:45.531 --> 02:01:47.333
TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL LIKE THEY

02:01:49.235 --> 02:01:50.603
THE BILL I'M NOT GONNA BE

02:01:50.670 --> 02:01:52.571
SUPPORTING IT ON THE FLOOR BUT

02:01:52.638 --> 02:01:54.340
AS I MENTIONED I WILL SUPPORT

02:01:54.407 --> 02:01:54.540

A CAME TO ME WITH THIS IDEA --

02:02:09.088 --> 02:02:11.957
AND THAT'S WHERE I THOUGHT I

02:02:12.024 --> 02:02:12.692
THOUGHT.

02:02:12.758 --> 02:02:14.427
I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD IDEA AND SO

02:02:14.493 --> 02:02:16.095

YEAH -- SO

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:29.368
TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE BILL WAS

02:03:29.435 --> 02:03:29.935
INTRODUCED THAT THROUGH THE

02:03:30.002 --> 02:03:31.337
CHAIR.

02:03:31.403 --> 02:03:33.639
I WE BASICALLY CAME IN AND SAID

02:03:33.706 --> 02:03:34.874
LOOK THERE'S THERE'S ROOM FOR US

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:36.475
TO WORK WE WORKED ON THE LICENSE

02:03:36.542 --> 02:03:37.910
PLATE READ A BILL WE WORKED ON

02:03:37.977 --> 02:03:38.477

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:39.678
AUTHOR --

02:03:39.745 --> 02:03:41.380
BUT THAT THAT PUBLIC HEARING IS

02:03:41.447 --> 02:03:42.615
A NON STARTER SO WE CAN MOVE

02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:44.216
PAST THAT THEN THERE'S ROOM FOR

02:03:44.283 --> 02:03:45.551
US TO START NARROWING THE

02:03:45.618 --> 02:03:46.719
DEFINITION AND WORKING ON

THAT HURDLE.

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:52.258
SO THE THE FACT THAT THERE IS

02:03:52.324 --> 02:03:53.425

WAS A NON STARTER FOR THE POLICE

02:04:08.674 --> 02:04:10.876
CHIEFS AND UNTIL UNTIL THAT

02:04:10.943 --> 02:04:12.611
MOVES.

02:04:12.678 --> 02:04:13.279

THERE PUBLIC AWARE OF IT IN THE

02:04:20.286 --> 02:04:21.754
COURTS ARE AWARE OF IT AND THEY

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:22.321

02:04:22.388 --> 02:04:23.422
AROUND IT.

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:24.523
