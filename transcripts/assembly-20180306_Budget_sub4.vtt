00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:04.183 region:rollup2
SENSE.

00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:05.918 region:rollup2
I'M ROUGHLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND

00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:07.486 region:rollup2
ELEVEN REGULARLY EVERY YEAR

00:28:05.918 --> 00:28:09.421 region:rollup2
MOVING MORE AND MORE ASSETS TO

00:28:07.486 --> 00:28:11.123 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY MANAGED. AS OPPOSED

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:12.257 region:rollup2
TO EXTERNALLY MANAGED.

00:28:11.123 --> 00:28:13.525 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE MANY BODIES OF

00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:15.194 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE WITH REGARDS

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:16.528 region:rollup2
TO THAT THAT THE BENEFITS OF

00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:18.830 region:rollup2
DOING THAT I WOULD JUST KIND OF

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:19.965 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT ONE WHICH IS THE C. E.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:22.367 region:rollup2
AND BENCHMARKING.

00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:25.204 region:rollup2
FIRM THAT PROVIDES ON DATA.

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:27.005 region:rollup2
REALLY ACT GLOBALLY FOR PUBLIC

00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:28.507 region:rollup2
PENSION SYSTEMS AND. YOU KNOW

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:31.577 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE NOTABLE.

00:28:28.507 --> 00:28:31.577 region:rollup2
FINDINGS FROM THEIR WORK AND UP

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:35.113 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING THIS IS THAT.

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:37.516 region:rollup2
ON AVERAGE.

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:40.752 region:rollup2
AND INTERNALLY MANAGED PASSIVE.

00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:42.421 region:rollup2
IT IS IS MUCH MUCH CHEAPER AND

00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:43.822 region:rollup2
STILL IN IN THE PASSIVE

00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:45.290 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT CAN STILL ACHIEVE

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:47.793 region:rollup2
SAME RETURN.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:50.562 region:rollup2
SO IT RANGES FROM ASSET STRATEGY

00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:52.097 region:rollup2
TO INVESTMENT TYPE BY IT COSTS

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:53.565 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE FROM THREE TIMES.

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:56.535 region:rollup2
YOU TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT TO

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:58.804 region:rollup2
OUTSOURCE ASSETS FOR. INVESTMENT

00:28:56.535 --> 00:29:01.473 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

00:28:58.804 --> 00:29:02.808 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU LOOK AT. AT A HAVING

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:04.576 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR ADDITIONAL

00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:06.945 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT OFFICERS.

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:08.246 region:rollup2
THERE'S COST AVOIDANCE IS BY

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:09.548 region:rollup2
BRINGING THOSE ASSETS IN HOUSE

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:11.450 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:29:09.548 --> 00:29:12.451 region:rollup2
THAT MORE THAN WHAT WOULD COVER

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.086 region:rollup2
THE COST OF THAT ADDITIONAL

00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:16.288 region:rollup2
SPACE.

00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:18.223 region:rollup2
FOR JUST A KIND OF A VERY.

00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:19.758 region:rollup2
KIND OF SIMPLIFIED EXAMPLE WE

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:21.593 region:rollup2
TOOK SOME DATA FROM C. E. AND

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:24.429 region:rollup2
THAT. BASICALLY SAID THAT IT'S

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:25.597 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY ONE BASIS POINTS TO

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:27.232 region:rollup2
EXTERNALLY MANAGE.

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:28.533 region:rollup2
ASSETS

00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:30.202 region:rollup2
IF YOU DO IT AND HOW MUCH YOU

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:31.770 region:rollup2
CAN DO IT FOR ABOUT FOUR BASIS

00:29:30.202 --> 00:29:33.105 region:rollup2
POINTS AND WHEN YOU DO THE MATH

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.539 region:rollup2
ON. THE SIZE OF THE FUND WE HAVE

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:36.074 region:rollup2
IT'S

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:37.409 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:39.211 region:rollup2
THAT IT ACTUALLY.

00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:40.912 region:rollup2
SAVES TO TO DO THIS WORK IN

00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:42.714 region:rollup2
HOUSE AND. NOT EVERY ASSET

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:44.182 region:rollup2
STRATEGY AND NOT EVERY PORTFOLIO

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:45.484 region:rollup2
CAN BE MANAGED INTERNALLY BUT

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:47.252 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT WE CAN AND ONCE WE

00:29:45.484 --> 00:29:48.854 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WERE. GONNA BE GREAT

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:51.590 region:rollup2
OUT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WERE

00:29:48.854 --> 00:29:52.791 region:rollup2
THAT WERE PURSUING.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.159 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU GET ONE A PLUS FOR

00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:56.161 region:rollup2
SECOND GOT A QUORUM HERE IS

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:58.730 region:rollup2
GOING TAKE ROLE PLEASE. COOPER

00:29:56.161 --> 00:30:03.769 region:rollup2
HERE ALLEN CABALLERO CHIU.

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:05.170 region:rollup2
CHOI HERE.

00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:06.805 region:rollup2
SO YOU ARE SAYING BASICALLY BY

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:10.108 region:rollup2
THREE TIMES SO.

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:12.411 region:rollup2
COSTING MORE FOR CONTRACTING

00:30:10.108 --> 00:30:14.546 region:rollup2
NOT EXTERNALLY. THAT'S CORRECT

00:30:12.411 --> 00:30:16.348 region:rollup2
IN A VERY CONSERVATIVE.

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:18.517 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL MANAGER WOULD BE.

00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:19.985 region:rollup2
ABOUT AT A MINIMUM THREE TIMES

00:30:18.517 --> 00:30:21.653 region:rollup2
MORE OF THE COST THAN INTERNALLY

00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:23.789 region:rollup2
MANAGED.

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:25.724 region:rollup2
SO INCLUDING VIA INITIAL NOT

00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:27.793 region:rollup2
EXPANSION OF FOR CONSTRUCTION

00:30:25.724 --> 00:30:30.028 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO A LONG TERM FULL

00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:31.963 region:rollup2
TIME EMPLOYEES OUT EX NUMBER

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:35.133 region:rollup2
WHAT PEOPLE. AND THAT THE A

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:36.368 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF FOREVER HUNDRED

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:37.969 region:rollup2
YEARS ESTILO.

00:30:36.368 --> 00:30:39.204 region:rollup2
IT ACOSTA LAST OF FOR INTERNAL

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:41.340 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:43.108 region:rollup2
THE EXAMPLE I'M REFERRING TO.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.842 region:rollup2
BASICALLY LOOKED AT THE SCOPE

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:46.211 region:rollup2
OF THE.

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:47.679 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:49.815 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT SHORTLY BUT IT.

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:51.283 region:rollup2
BASICALLY LOOKED AT A FIVE TYPE

00:30:49.815 --> 00:30:53.051 region:rollup2
TIME HORIZON BUT.

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:53.719 region:rollup2
EVEN LOOKING OUTWARDS FOR THE

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:55.120 region:rollup2
LONG TERM.

00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:57.022 region:rollup2
A CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.324 region:rollup2
SALARY.

00:30:57.022 --> 00:31:01.159 region:rollup2
INCLUDING WITH ON BENEFITS AND

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:02.728 region:rollup2
PENSION AND HEALTH CARE. AND

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:04.296 region:rollup2
THEN THE INDIRECT COSTS THAT

00:31:02.728 --> 00:31:05.764 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD ALSO BE CHARGED WITH

00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:07.566 region:rollup2
FOR HAVING OF A BUILDING IN

00:31:05.764 --> 00:31:09.034 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND THAT AND THAT AND

00:31:07.566 --> 00:31:10.902 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD

00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:13.171 region:rollup2
NEED. IS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:15.707 region:rollup2
LESS EXPENSIVE THAN SENDING

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:17.776 region:rollup2
THESE ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:19.077 region:rollup2
FIRM TO MANAGE ITS ORIGIN DID

00:31:17.776 --> 00:31:20.112 region:rollup2
NOT AND NEVER TO SWING. PULL

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:22.380 region:rollup2
BACK ON THAT I WANNA GO BACK TO

00:31:20.112 --> 00:31:26.218 region:rollup2
THE FACT OF THE THE EXTINCTION

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:27.819 region:rollup2
LAST YOU GUYS CAME FOR US. US TO

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:28.987 region:rollup2
PUSH UP TO NINETEEN.

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:30.188 region:rollup2
NOT AGREE ESTAS BRING A BACKLESS

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:31.156 region:rollup2
SHIRT EIGHTEEN AND THE ISSUES

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:33.058 region:rollup2
THAT COMES BACK OCTOBER. WAS

00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:33.692 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S ISSUER CHANGES IN

00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:34.392 region:rollup2
THE NEXT MONTH THE GOES BACK TO

00:31:33.692 --> 00:31:36.261 region:rollup2
THE BOARD.

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:37.896 region:rollup2
SO HOW LONG TIME THERE SO THAT'S

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:39.197 region:rollup2
REALLY THE ISSUE ELDRITCH SHARON

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:40.599 region:rollup2
REQUEST

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:43.735 region:rollup2
TO BRING IT BACK TILL THEM TO

00:31:40.599 --> 00:31:44.936 region:rollup2
EXCUSE ME TO PUSH LOT NINETEEN.

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:46.271 region:rollup2
AND I WANNA BRING IT BACK SO I'M

00:31:44.936 --> 00:31:48.673 region:rollup2
REALLY CONFUSED.

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:50.242 region:rollup2
WHY THAT WAS?

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:51.943 region:rollup2
SO ORIGINALLY WE WERE CONCERNED

00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:53.712 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TIMELINE FOR BRINGING

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:55.213 region:rollup2
ON THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION

00:31:53.712 --> 00:31:56.915 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT FIRM AND THE

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:58.917 region:rollup2
ARCHITECT AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE

00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:00.685 region:rollup2
TO SPEED THAT UP SO THAT'S

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:02.020 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:05.323 region:rollup2
RICHARD COOPER THAT.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:07.426 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY THAT THE LANGUAGE AS

00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:09.027 region:rollup2
PRESENTED WAS FOR EIGHTEEN WE

00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:11.363 region:rollup2
ASK BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:12.364 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ABILITY OF US TO GET

00:32:11.363 --> 00:32:13.799 region:rollup2
THROUGH ALL THE PROCESSES TO

00:32:12.364 --> 00:32:14.966 region:rollup2
ACQUIRE THE CONSTRUCTION

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:16.701 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO DO THE

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:18.837 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES.

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:20.372 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCELERATE

00:32:18.837 --> 00:32:25.377 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS AND NOW WE'RE BACK

00:32:20.372 --> 00:32:26.912 region:rollup2
AT THE ORIGINAL REQUEST.

00:32:25.377 --> 00:32:30.615 region:rollup2
IT WAS FREELY ILLEGALS OFFICE DO

00:32:26.912 --> 00:32:32.217 region:rollup2
YOU THE COMMENTS.

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:33.552 region:rollup2
RYAN MILLER FROM THE ILIO I WE

00:32:32.217 --> 00:32:36.154 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC

00:32:33.552 --> 00:32:36.788 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON ON THE BUILDING BUT

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:38.190 region:rollup2
I I GUESS WE WOULD JUST NOTE

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.391 region:rollup2
THAT. IT CERTAINLY IS

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.926 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:43.395 region:rollup2
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:32:40.926 --> 00:32:44.362 region:rollup2
BUT TIMELINE OF THE BUILDING IN

00:32:43.395 --> 00:32:45.630 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:47.532 region:rollup2
IF THE REPORT COMES IN IN THE

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:49.467 region:rollup2
FALL THE LEGISLATURE MAY NOT

00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:51.703 region:rollup2
HAVE MUCH UP PERTINENT A TO. TO

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:53.071 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW GIVEN SNOW SESSION

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:54.239 region:rollup2
DATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT MAY

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:55.574 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:32:54.239 --> 00:32:57.843 region:rollup2
SCRUTINIZE.

00:32:55.574 --> 00:32:59.911 region:rollup2
THE REPORT SO.

00:32:57.843 --> 00:33:01.279 region:rollup2
YEAH I BET MAYBE BEEN MAY BE

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:02.881 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE COMMITTEE

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:04.216 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH CAL STIRS AND SEE

00:33:02.881 --> 00:33:05.817 region:rollup2
IF YOU KNOW THERE'S A KIND OF

00:33:04.216 --> 00:33:07.452 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE TIMELINE THAT CAN BE

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:09.487 region:rollup2
HASHED OUT. THAT SOMEONE RIGHT

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:11.022 region:rollup2
NOW AS A CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE A

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:12.057 region:rollup2
TIMELESS LOOKING OVER NICKELBACK

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:13.458 region:rollup2
AND IN FIGURE SOMETHING ELSE OUT

00:33:12.057 --> 00:33:14.960 region:rollup2
BUT. TO GIVE SUCH SHORT TIME

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:15.961 region:rollup2
LINE IN CASE SOMETHING DOES COME

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.129 region:rollup2
UP.

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:21.466 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE SO RULED

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:22.033 region:rollup2
WORK WITH CASTERS ON THAT BOAT.

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:22.300 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED FIGURE SOMETHING

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:23.168 region:rollup2
ELSE OUT.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.971 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WE'RE PREPARED TO

00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:28.807 region:rollup2
ANSWER BUTTONS THAT QUESTIONS

00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:30.709 region:rollup2
EXCEPT FOR A AND B. BY JULY SO

00:33:28.807 --> 00:33:32.444 region:rollup2
THAT'S YOU KNOW. THE IT'S JUST

00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:34.579 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE ACTUAL

00:33:32.444 --> 00:33:37.115 region:rollup2
FINAL COST ESTIMATES THAT WERE

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:38.950 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE.

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:40.652 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE COULD DO IS PROVIDE.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.387 region:rollup2
.

00:33:40.652 --> 00:33:44.890 region:rollup2
NOT TO EXCEED AMOUNTS

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:46.057 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.659 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO WE WORK WITH STAFF ON

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:48.360 region:rollup2
THAT MEASURE FIGURE SOMETHING

00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:50.061 region:rollup2
OUT BUT RIGHT NOW.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.597 region:rollup2
I DO WANT EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:53.932 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT. HOME SO GLAD ONE

00:33:52.597 --> 00:34:00.572 region:rollup2
ITEM NUMBER TWO.

EXTERNALLY MANAGED STRUCTURE

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:46.478 region:rollup2

TERRITORY WE'RE BUILDING A

00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:56.627 region:rollup2
PLATFORM THAT COULD BE LEVERAGED

00:54:54.992 --> 00:54:59.196 region:rollup2
FOR A FULL STATEWIDE PROGRAM.

00:54:56.627 --> 00:55:00.898 region:rollup2

PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY.

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:10.073 region:rollup2
IT'S PARTLY WHY WE HAVE A LITTLE

00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:11.575 region:rollup2
BIT OF A DELAY AND THAT ROLLOUT

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:13.110 region:rollup2
IS WE DON'T HAVE A MODEL FROM

00:55:11.575 --> 00:55:13.944 region:rollup2
ANOTHER STATE TO FOLLOW WHERE.

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:16.947 region:rollup2

I AND SLIDE NUMBER SIX TALKS A

00:55:37.568 --> 00:55:40.103 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR RESIDENTIAL

WHICH HAS A SUCCESSFUL MODEL IN

00:55:54.384 --> 00:55:56.753 region:rollup2
MANY WAYS BUT THERE ARE MANY

SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE EQUITY IN

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:03.360 region:rollup2
THEIR HOME TO DO SO. AND THEY'RE

00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:03.894 region:rollup2
JUST NOT A LOT OF UNSECURED

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.395 region:rollup2

00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:31.308 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH OUR

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:36.313 region:rollup2
IT WILL NEED IN THE UPCOMING

00:58:34.578 --> 00:58:38.648 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS. WE THINK TAKING

00:58:36.313 --> 00:58:39.516 region:rollup2
THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:40.017 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S TYPICAL BUDGETING

ARE CHANGES TO THESE PILOT

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:56.733 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. AND WE WOULD KNOW THAT

WITH A JAIL BE SEEN NOTICE AND

TO TEST WHETHER ON THE OVER

UNDERSTAND THAT CREDIT SCORES

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:03.393 region:rollup2
THAT ALWAYS REFLECT INCOME SO

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:04.895 region:rollup2
EXPANDING ACCESS BOTH TO THOSE

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:06.630 region:rollup2
WITH LOWER CREDIT SCORES AS WELL

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:08.398 region:rollup2
AS TO LO MEIN INCOME SO.

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:10.934 region:rollup2
THE LENDER WILL THEN BE ABLE TO

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:12.536 region:rollup2
RELY ON THAT FUND SO IF THEY DO

01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:15.171 region:rollup2

THEY CAN BE MADE PARTIALLY HOLE.

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:19.075 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DESIGNED IT SO THAT

01:01:17.641 --> 01:01:21.511 region:rollup2
LETTER ALSO A SKIN IN THE GAME.

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:22.946 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T COVER THE FULL LOS.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:24.648 region:rollup2
AND THAT SITE NUMBER SIX WITH

01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:26.116 region:rollup2
THE TABLE THERE SHOWS YOU THE

01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:27.551 region:rollup2
COMPARISON BETWEEN THE LENDER

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:29.019 region:rollup2
STANDARD PRODUCT AND WHAT

THEY'RE ABLE TO OFFER TO

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:32.789 region:rollup2
BORROWERS. I'M IF THEY HAVE WHEN

01:08:44.454 --> 01:08:48.992 region:rollup2
AND WE DOCUMENTED ABOUT HALF OF

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:50.693 region:rollup2
THEM AS OF TODAY.

01:08:48.992 --> 01:08:51.361 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LONG RUNWAY THOUGH YOU

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.495 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HAVE.

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:54.530 region:rollup2
FIRST REALLY GO THROUGH THIS

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:55.365 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PROCESS DOCUMENTATION

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.500 region:rollup2
THEM GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:59.235 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PROCESS RE ENGINEERING.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.770 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS

01:08:59.235 --> 01:09:02.538 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE START WRITING

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:04.741 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEW SYSTEM.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:06.042 region:rollup2
SO WE REALLY DON'T ANTICIPATE

01:09:04.741 --> 01:09:11.381 region:rollup2
HAVING A NEW SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:14.784 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS.

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:16.452 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE.

01:09:14.784 --> 01:09:18.121 region:rollup2
INSTEAD WE ARE.

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:18.654 region:rollup2
JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:20.189 region:rollup2
TOTALLY NEW SYSTEM IS THAT

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:22.225 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.458 region:rollup2
I'M I DON'T KNOW YET WE HAVE

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:24.527 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:26.462 region:rollup2
SEVEN DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.763 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO ANALYZE ONE

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.297 region:rollup2
OF THEM IS.

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:29.599 region:rollup2
.

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:31.401 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY USING THE SAME

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:32.902 region:rollup2
MAINFRAME BASED SYSTEM WE HAVE

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:34.804 region:rollup2
TODAY BUT CREATING MODERN

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:35.405 region:rollup2
INTERFACES TO IT FOR THE

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:37.540 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND THE.

01:09:35.405 --> 01:09:39.142 region:rollup2
YOUR OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.576 region:rollup2
INTERFACE WITH.

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:42.245 region:rollup2
BUT I I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:43.579 region:rollup2
YET I PROBABLY WON'T FOR ABOUT

01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:45.648 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS THAT THAT'S WHEN WE'LL

01:09:43.579 --> 01:09:47.016 region:rollup2
FINISH ARE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:48.751 region:rollup2
AND WILL HAVE A AN IDEA OF WHAT

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:50.319 region:rollup2
DIRECTION WE WILL TAKE. IT VERY

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:51.487 region:rollup2
WELL COULD BE A COMPLETELY NEW

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.488 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.856 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE AN OFF THE SHELF

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.925 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IT COULD BE A CUSTOM

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:59.929 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED SYSTEM.

01:09:55.925 --> 01:10:02.365 region:rollup2
WE JUST DON'T KNOW TODAY.

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:04.801 region:rollup2
HAVING SOME EXPERIENCE WITH.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:06.102 region:rollup2

AB PROCESS EXIST THEN NEW

01:10:13.843 --> 01:10:18.114 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:20.083 region:rollup2
FOR. DETERMINING WHAT THE NEEDS

01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:22.418 region:rollup2

THAT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE AND I'M

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:32.462 region:rollup2
ASSUMING THAT THAT'S KIND OF

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:32.829 region:rollup2

LIFECYCLE MIX WE STARTED WITH

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:52.215 region:rollup2
STAGE ONE AND WE'RE WORKING OUR

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:53.883 region:rollup2
WAY THROUGH FROM THERE WE DIDN'T

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:55.852 region:rollup2
TRY TO PICK UP WHERE THE LAST

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:56.919 region:rollup2
PROJECT LEFT OFF THAT WAS MY

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:58.821 region:rollup2
QUESTION YOU SAID IT MUCH BETTER

THAN I. WHITEST BUT WHAT ONE OF

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:01.924 region:rollup2
THE BIG BIG LESSONS LEARNED WAS

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:02.892 region:rollup2
WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DOCUMENT

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:05.361 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESSES.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:07.230 region:rollup2

INTO FIGURING OUT WHAT TO BUY.

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.437 region:rollup2

WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ASSERT

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:36.712 region:rollup2
THAT ANNUAL FUNDING OF SCO WORK

HIGHER POSITIONS.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:50.559 region:rollup2
AYE AND THIS TO BE DUE TO THE

01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:52.728 region:rollup2

TIME FRAME AT THIS POINT FOR

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:15.104 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE COMPLETED.

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:17.506 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE INTEGRATED

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:19.008 region:rollup2
SOLUTION PORTION IS EXPECTED TO

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:21.210 region:rollup2
BE FULLY ALIVE BY JULY TWENTY

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:24.313 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

DATE IS SET. THAT'S A GOOD SOLID

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:41.263 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY.

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:44.967 region:rollup2
SO.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:45.701 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN YEARS LATER.

THAT THE SCOUT TEAM FROM SCO'S

01:17:08.424 --> 01:17:17.199 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE IN JULY TWENTY TEN.

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:21.103 region:rollup2
SO I'VE BEEN HERE TWENTY

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:22.304 region:rollup2
CONCEIVED EVERY OKAY.

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:23.806 region:rollup2
BOB LET ME ASK JUST BIG PICTURE

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.773 region:rollup2
ON THE BUDGET SO.

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.374 region:rollup2
THOUGH I THINK LAST YEAR THE

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:25.975 region:rollup2
STATE AUDITOR SAID THAT THIS

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:26.242 region:rollup2
PROJECT WAS A QUARTER BILLION

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:27.576 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:28.444 region:rollup2
UNDER BUDGET SO WE HAD TO PUT

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:29.512 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY INTO IT WHERE'S THE

01:17:28.444 --> 01:17:30.146 region:rollup2
BUDGET AT THIS POINT IN WHAT

01:17:29.512 --> 01:17:30.746 region:rollup2
YOU'RE EXPECTING.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:30.946 region:rollup2
BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:32.348 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:33.182 region:rollup2
SO.

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:35.518 region:rollup2
WHY WE SHOULD DEFER THOSE TO

01:17:33.182 --> 01:17:35.851 region:rollup2
FISK OUT AND FINANCE BUT AS IN

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:37.486 region:rollup2
LIEU OF THAT?

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:38.787 region:rollup2
AND ELLIE OWES REPORT THEY WANT

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:41.390 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAPTURE ALL

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:43.192 region:rollup2
OF OUR COSTS FROM SCO AND OUR

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.560 region:rollup2
AND OUR EFFORT OR IN THE FISCAL

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:45.895 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED SOLUTION AND TECH

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.998 region:rollup2
COUNT PROBLEMS. SO WE COULD HAVE

01:17:45.895 --> 01:17:50.366 region:rollup2
A GOOD PICTURE AT THE END.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:51.667 region:rollup2
OKAY TO EVEN ANSWER THIS POINT

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:53.302 region:rollup2
FROM FINANCE AND WHAT THE

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:54.203 region:rollup2
BUDGETS GONNA LOOK LIKE HOW MUCH

01:17:53.302 --> 01:17:57.907 region:rollup2
AND WE SPENT SO FAR WOULD YOU

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:59.642 region:rollup2
PROTECTING.

01:17:57.907 --> 01:18:00.276 region:rollup2
COURTESY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:04.446 region:rollup2
FINANCE WE WOULD HAVE TO DEFER

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:05.080 region:rollup2
DRIVE OUR FOLKS ON THE FISCAL

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:05.414 region:rollup2
ASSIGNMENT SO WE CAN GET BACK TO

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.382 region:rollup2
YOU WITH THE.

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:07.850 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE NOT HERE.

01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:08.951 region:rollup2
OKAY. CAN WE GET THAT AS SOON AS

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:10.419 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE ARE WE DO

01:18:08.951 --> 01:18:12.087 region:rollup2
HAVE A HEARING ON THIS

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:13.255 region:rollup2
TODAY SELL BE GREAT AND OTHERS.

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:14.557 region:rollup2
I THINK I THINK ONE OF THE IT

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:15.691 region:rollup2
INSIDE YOU HAVE SOMETHING

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:16.125 region:rollup2
TO ADD TO THIS.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:16.992 region:rollup2
SELECT

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:20.162 region:rollup2
ANALYSTS ON

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:20.996 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A NEW SPECIAL.

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:23.599 region:rollup2
NOW

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:24.700 region:rollup2
IT MUM.

01:18:23.599 --> 01:18:25.935 region:rollup2
MIND IT WAS MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:28.270 region:rollup2
THE TOTAL PROJECT COST THAT

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:29.772 region:rollup2
BROUGHT IT TO NINE HUNDRED AND

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.606 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:32.208 region:rollup2
SCOTT PROJECT.

01:18:30.606 --> 01:18:33.275 region:rollup2
AS WAS NOTED THE LEGISLATIVE

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.843 region:rollup2
ANALYST'S OFFICE RECENTLY

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:36.178 region:rollup2
RELEASED A REPORT ON IT ONE OF

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:38.247 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERNS WHERE THAT.

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:39.715 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT COST RELATED THE

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:41.684 region:rollup2
FISCAL PROJECT WERE ACTUALLY

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:43.485 region:rollup2
PLACED OUTSIDE OF THAT MOST

01:18:41.684 --> 01:18:44.286 region:rollup2
NOTABLY BEING THE COST AT THE

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:45.387 region:rollup2
STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:47.656 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THE INTEGRATED

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:49.024 region:rollup2
SOLUTION. AS WITH NOTED WE DON'T

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:50.826 region:rollup2
HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE VENDOR

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:51.460 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PIECE OF THE PCP

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:52.528 region:rollup2
THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE SEE IS

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.696 region:rollup2
UNRELATED. BUT FOR THE

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:54.830 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED SOLUTION WITH THE

01:18:53.696 --> 01:18:56.532 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:58.133 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN COST THAT WE THINK

01:18:56.532 --> 01:18:59.401 region:rollup2
SHOULD ACTUALLY BE ATTRIBUTED.

01:18:58.133 --> 01:19:00.502 region:rollup2
TO THE FISCAL PROJECT THAT

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:02.104 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ARE NOT AND THERE'S

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.705 region:rollup2
OTHER COSTS THAT WE RAISED IN

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:03.372 region:rollup2
OUR REPORT THAT ARE ALSO SORT

01:19:02.705 --> 01:19:05.474 region:rollup2
OF.

01:19:03.372 --> 01:19:07.309 region:rollup2
PUSHED OUTSIDE THE PROJECT AND

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:08.210 region:rollup2
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ALLOW FOR

01:19:07.309 --> 01:19:09.178 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:11.513 region:rollup2
COMPLETE AND ACCURATE ACCOUNTING

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:14.149 region:rollup2
OF ALL OF THE COSTS RELATED TO

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:16.552 region:rollup2
THE FISCAL PROJECT OKAY BUT THAT

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:18.253 region:rollup2
HASN'T HAPPENED YET EVEN THE IT

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:20.022 region:rollup2
DOES YOU DON'T YOU SAID YOU DONT

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:21.423 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A SEVEN THOUGHT ON

01:19:20.022 --> 01:19:24.159 region:rollup2
THIS. BUT THAT STILL HASN'T COME

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:26.161 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. AS REFLECTED IN THE S.

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:28.063 region:rollup2
P. ARE THE TOTAL COST IS NINE

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:29.265 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:31.433 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:33.402 region:rollup2
WHAT HAS NOT BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:39.275 region:rollup2
IS THE COST OF THESE OTHER

01:19:33.402 --> 01:19:39.575 region:rollup2
PIECES? THAT UNDER THE SPR WOULD

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.476 region:rollup2
COME LATER.

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:42.478 region:rollup2
OKAY I YOU KNOW I JUST NOTE FOR

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:43.145 region:rollup2
FOR COLLEAGUES OF MY GUESSES

01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:43.946 region:rollup2
EACH RIVER INDIVIDUAL IMPACTS ON

01:19:43.145 --> 01:19:45.047 region:rollup2
THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE IS

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:45.614 region:rollup2
PROBABLY LESS EVERY YEAR THAN

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:46.248 region:rollup2
THE COST DIFFERENCE IN THIS

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:48.484 region:rollup2
PROJECT AND SO THIS IS IN PART

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:48.817 region:rollup2
WHY. I CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS

01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:48.951 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA.

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.085 region:rollup2
.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:51.186 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT.

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:51.854 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY DALY OWES MADE SOME

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.521 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS OF HOW WE HANDLE

01:19:51.854 --> 01:19:53.355 region:rollup2
THIS AND

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.056 region:rollup2
SCO BELIEVES THAT THAT MIGHT

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:55.291 region:rollup2
SLOW THINGS DOWN LIKE A YOU KNOW

01:19:54.056 --> 01:19:56.792 region:rollup2
FOR MY PERSPECTIVE I WANT THIS

FOR LARA LARGE PROJECTS IT'S NOT

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:06.021 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.756 region:rollup2
EVEN REQUIRE THE PROJECT TO

IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THE

01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:22.004 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE COULD IMPLEMENT IF

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:24.606 region:rollup2
IT WISHES BOOK ASSUME THE COST

01:22:22.004 --> 01:22:25.340 region:rollup2

THIS PROJECT.

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.642 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IT MAYBE IT DOES

01:22:25.908 --> 01:22:29.044 region:rollup2
CONSIDER.

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:31.647 region:rollup2

THAT DOES REQUIRE THE ONGOING

01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:45.461 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS AND THAT QUARTERLY

01:22:40.856 --> 01:22:47.429 region:rollup2

CONTROLLERS SPENT.

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:12.054 region:rollup2
THIS IS A PROJECT THAT HAS NOT

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:12.988 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO.

01:23:12.054 --> 01:23:14.122 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS NOT ABLE TO GET A

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:15.057 region:rollup2
HANDLE ON AND NOW WE'RE TALKING

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:16.558 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALMOST A BILLION DOLLAR

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:18.427 region:rollup2
COST.

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:19.962 region:rollup2

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:26.368 region:rollup2
IS TO. GIVE US SOME CERTAINTY

01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:27.436 region:rollup2

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:28.937 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:32.875 region:rollup2
WE ARE USING THE TAXPAYER

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:33.609 region:rollup2

ON IS THE LENGTH OF TIME.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:42.451 region:rollup2

MORE THE LONGER PROJECTS THAT IT

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:49.691 region:rollup2
HAS GONE ON SO. I DO THINK IT

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:51.526 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:53.395 region:rollup2
ATTENTION.

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:55.264 region:rollup2
IT ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:56.798 region:rollup2
TO SHUT OFF ACCOUNTABLE JUST.

01:23:55.264 --> 01:23:58.400 region:rollup2

THEY'RE NO GUARANTEES

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:05.541 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO THAT'S THE ISSUE

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.074 region:rollup2
THAT THAT.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:06.842 region:rollup2
IN LIGHT OF MY COLLEAGUES

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:08.677 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT I.

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:10.712 region:rollup2
DOES RAISE SOME CONCERNS

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:11.980 region:rollup2
IS COVERAGE OF A QUESTION.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.748 region:rollup2
WELL I WAS JUST TRYING TO

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:18.153 region:rollup2

THIS IS ON A DATA INPUT.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:30.866 region:rollup2
ISSUE OR IS THIS THE DEVELOPMENT

01:24:29.031 --> 01:24:32.167 region:rollup2
OF THE SYSTEMS ISSUE BECAUSE MY

01:24:30.866 --> 01:24:34.002 region:rollup2

NATURE OF THE WORK THAT IS

01:24:49.685 --> 01:24:53.155 region:rollup2
CAUSED BY THE INJURY TO

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:54.690 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

01:24:53.155 --> 01:24:56.858 region:rollup2
UP AS HE STATED OF S. A WILL NOT

01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:58.327 region:rollup2
BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED INTO FIFTH

01:25:23.752 --> 01:25:26.855 region:rollup2
ALL THE TRANSACTIONS ARE POSTING

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:28.490 region:rollup2
ON A REGULAR BASIS THE NORMAL

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:30.058 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD IS STILL THERE BUT

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:31.994 region:rollup2
SOMEONE NOW HAS TO RECONCILE

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:34.162 region:rollup2
THAT THE TRANSACTIONS. AND THE

01:25:31.994 --> 01:25:35.864 region:rollup2
LEDGER ACTUALLY BALANCE SO WE

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:37.933 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE A STATE Y. LEDGER OUT

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:40.135 region:rollup2
OF THIS GAL TO BILL TO MAKE SURE

01:25:37.933 --> 01:25:41.370 region:rollup2
THAT THE SYSTEM IS IS BEHAVING

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:43.005 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:44.640 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY CUT OVER THE

01:25:43.005 --> 01:25:46.208 region:rollup2
TRUE BOOK OF RECORD INTO FISCAL.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.310 region:rollup2
RIGHT

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:50.112 region:rollup2
SO SO IT IT MAY BE I THINK THAT

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:51.713 region:rollup2
THE IDEA BEHIND FISCAL IS THAT

01:25:50.112 --> 01:25:53.482 region:rollup2
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO UPDATE.

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:55.684 region:rollup2
THAT THE SYSTEM SO THAT.

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:56.985 region:rollup2
.

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:58.720 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY IS USING THE SAME

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:00.789 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN INPUTTING THE DATA IN

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.923 region:rollup2
THE SAME AYE SO. I'M ASSUMING

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:03.659 region:rollup2
THESE ARE TEMPORARY POSITIONS AT

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:05.560 region:rollup2
SOME POINT YEAH.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:07.362 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO CREATE

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.097 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES NOT CREATE MORE

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:09.831 region:rollup2
WORK FOR READY TO DO IT I JUST

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:10.966 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:12.200 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:26:10.966 --> 01:26:14.369 region:rollup2
MOVING TOWARDS.

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.804 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN HAVING DIFFERENT

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:17.339 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN OPERATING

01:26:15.804 --> 01:26:18.774 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST.

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:19.841 region:rollup2
YES THERE IS I'M THERE SOME

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:20.575 region:rollup2
LIMITED TERM BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.711 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:24.379 region:rollup2
PERMANENT RESOURCES THAT WILL

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:26.248 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BE NEEDED.

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:28.083 region:rollup2
AND THE PERMANENT RESOURCES ARE

01:26:26.248 --> 01:26:28.917 region:rollup2
NEEDED BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:31.486 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE COMPLICATED I'M JUST

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:33.155 region:rollup2
TRYING TO. TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:34.489 region:rollup2
IS THAT YOU GO FROM EIGHT HOW

01:26:33.155 --> 01:26:36.858 region:rollup2
YOU CREATE EFFICIENCIES THROUGH

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:48.937 region:rollup2
A NEW PLATFORM AND THEN END UP

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:50.172 region:rollup2
HAVING TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE.

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:51.640 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE THIS IS THE SUBJECT

01:26:50.172 --> 01:26:52.641 region:rollup2
FOR THE LONGER HEARING BUT IT

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.177 region:rollup2
JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IT AT SOME

01:26:52.641 --> 01:27:06.888 region:rollup2
POINT. YEAR IN THE IDEAS YOU'RE

01:26:55.177 --> 01:27:07.422 region:rollup2
CREATING THE EFFICIENCIES.

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:14.096 region:rollup2
GOT IT PAY FOR ONE OF FOUR

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:17.532 region:rollup2
PARTNERS.

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:18.467 region:rollup2
IT'S ALREADY BEEN.

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:19.267 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES ARE FOR YOU.

01:27:18.467 --> 01:27:20.102 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:24.906 region:rollup2
HARLEM.

01:27:20.102 --> 01:27:26.541 region:rollup2
BEING A PART.

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:29.311 region:rollup2
OPERATE. HAVEN'T GOTTEN.

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:29.878 region:rollup2
FULL.

01:27:29.311 --> 01:27:33.048 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT MOST OF THE

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:35.517 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE.

01:27:33.048 --> 01:27:36.051 region:rollup2
AND THEN HAVE HIM. CONTROLS. FOR

01:27:35.517 --> 01:27:37.119 region:rollup2
TRYING TO BUILD THOSE TWO

01:27:36.051 --> 01:27:38.887 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:27:37.119 --> 01:27:41.223 region:rollup2
A FACT THAT WE DIDN'T GO. FIRST

01:27:38.887 --> 01:27:44.226 region:rollup2
QUICKLY CONTROL FUNCTIONALITY

01:27:41.223 --> 01:27:46.495 region:rollup2
THAT ARE OPEN RECORD MAKES IT

01:27:44.226 --> 01:27:47.095 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR HER TO GET ON.

01:27:46.495 --> 01:27:49.664 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN TRAINS ALREADY YEAH

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:51.099 region:rollup2
GO.

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:54.870 region:rollup2
TO ANOTHER QUESTION YOU'RE

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:56.138 region:rollup2
ASKING THAT PROJECT. SHOULD BE.

01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:57.405 region:rollup2
SLX DIFFICULT AWARE TUNING

01:27:56.138 --> 01:27:58.573 region:rollup2
INFORMATION NOW SCO. IMPRINT

WELL BECAUSE YOU LIKE HAVE TO

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.915 region:rollup2
KILL. HALF PART OF THIS.

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:07.516 region:rollup2
AND.

01:28:06.915 --> 01:28:07.716 region:rollup2
THE PART THAT HAVE ARE PEOPLE

WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING?

01:28:09.217 --> 01:28:14.556 region:rollup2
BILL.

EVERYTHING THAT'S WHAT

01:28:14.556 --> 01:28:16.525 region:rollup2
CLEVELAND'S ROLLING UP BUT ONLY

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:17.125 region:rollup2
TO A POINT.

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:18.527 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.927 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE THAT IN FOR.

01:28:18.527 --> 01:28:22.397 region:rollup2
ROLL IT INTO OUR.

01:28:18.927 --> 01:28:28.470 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:29.771 region:rollup2
IF I MAY FOR.

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:31.473 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN I PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL CONTACTS PRESSURE.

01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:35.343 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL INTENT REGARDING

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:36.378 region:rollup2
THE ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:38.680 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS WITH TO REALLY BRING

01:28:36.378 --> 01:28:40.081 region:rollup2
THEM ONLINE ALL AT ONCE.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:41.583 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE ONLINE IN TWENTY

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:43.552 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN HOWEVER THERE WAS

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:44.686 region:rollup2
PERSISTENT CHALLENGES RELATED TO

01:28:43.552 --> 01:28:46.788 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE TESTING

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:48.123 region:rollup2
OF THESE FUNCTIONS. AS A RESULT

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:49.591 region:rollup2
OF THOSE CHALLENGES S. P. ARE

01:28:48.123 --> 01:28:51.059 region:rollup2
SUMMONED HIM THE LATEST PLAN IF

01:28:49.591 --> 01:28:52.661 region:rollup2
YOU DO INTRODUCES A NEW APPROACH

01:28:51.059 --> 01:28:54.596 region:rollup2
FOR THAT RATHER THAN COMING

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:56.298 region:rollup2
ONLINE. IN WHOLE KIND OF ON A

01:28:54.596 --> 01:28:58.833 region:rollup2
SINGLE DAY INTEGRATED SOLUTION

01:28:56.298 --> 01:29:00.569 region:rollup2
BUILD INTERFACES BETWEEN BOTH I

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:02.404 region:rollup2
FEEL THE LEGACY SYSTEMS AND

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:04.372 region:rollup2
FIFTH OUT. AND THIS IS IN

01:29:02.404 --> 01:29:05.340 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO CONCERNS THE STATE

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:06.074 region:rollup2
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HAS FACED

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.909 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST REGARDING THE

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:09.110 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY OF THE

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:10.679 region:rollup2
SCALE. THIS IS REALLY AN

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:13.081 region:rollup2
INTRODUCTION FOR THE BALLOT IN

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:14.249 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM THE INTENT MEAN WHEN

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.450 region:rollup2
SCO WITH COMPETENT IN THE

01:29:14.249 --> 01:29:17.152 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE THE FIFTH OUT THEN

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.954 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD TRANSITION OVER. OUR

01:29:17.152 --> 01:29:20.789 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S NO.

01:29:18.954 --> 01:29:22.757 region:rollup2
IN THE FDR THERE'S NO SPECIFIC

01:29:20.789 --> 01:29:23.859 region:rollup2
DATE FOR WHEN. YOU KNOW WHAT

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:28.129 region:rollup2
WHAT WILL ACCOUNT FOR THOSE

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:30.699 region:rollup2
ASSURANCES AND WHEN I FEEL FULLY

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:32.701 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONS OVER TO THE AFGHAN.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.169 region:rollup2
AS WITH THE ORIGINAL VISION BUT

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:36.805 region:rollup2
WELL IN READING THIS IN TWENTY

01:29:34.169 --> 01:29:42.110 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THEY'RE

01:29:36.805 --> 01:29:42.344 region:rollup2
UP FORTY ONE ONGOING POSITION

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.478 region:rollup2
SOSUS.

01:29:42.344 --> 01:29:44.412 region:rollup2
YEAH YOU READ ALL THE REQUEST

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.013 region:rollup2
AND HIS MIND NUMBING.

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:45.647 region:rollup2
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND RIGHT

01:29:45.013 --> 01:29:46.047 region:rollup2
NOW THE TRACK RECORD IS NOT THAT

01:29:45.647 --> 01:29:47.115 region:rollup2
GOOD.

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.550 region:rollup2
SO SO SO WHAT POINT DO WE JUST.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:49.150 region:rollup2
STOP WRITTEN.

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:50.652 region:rollup2
IN CHANGECOURSE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:51.620 region:rollup2
DOING RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING

01:29:50.652 --> 01:29:53.488 region:rollup2
FOR SAID APPEARING GO AND

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:54.789 region:rollup2
APPROVED IS MAKING SENSE.

01:29:53.488 --> 01:29:55.824 region:rollup2
OUR RECOMMENDATION IS FOR THAT

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:57.325 region:rollup2
CAN HEREBY HERE APPROVALS THAT

01:29:55.824 --> 01:29:58.793 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE

01:29:57.325 --> 01:30:01.129 region:rollup2
TRACK HOW IT'S MOVING FORWARD

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:02.297 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER ANY ONGOING

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:04.099 region:rollup2
POSITIONS ARE VALLEY THAT WE CAN

01:30:02.297 --> 01:30:05.333 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE DECISION BASED ON

01:30:04.099 --> 01:30:06.768 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN RECORD EVEN OVER PRIOR

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:08.904 region:rollup2
YEARS IT DOES COME BACK EVERY

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:09.537 region:rollup2
YEAR SO. THERE HAS BEEN THAT IN

01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:11.539 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:12.107 region:rollup2
A YEAR BY YEAR APPROVAL RIGHT

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:14.576 region:rollup2
NOW IS NAY ONGOING ALL THIS

01:30:12.107 --> 01:30:15.610 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:17.512 region:rollup2
IN A STILL HASN'T CORRECTED WITH

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:19.714 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES.

01:30:17.512 --> 01:30:21.549 region:rollup2
SO WHY WILL WE CONTINUE GOING

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:23.518 region:rollup2
YEAR BY YEAR THE COMES BACK. TO

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:25.453 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE EVERY YEAR SO.

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.987 region:rollup2
WHY WE LOVE THAT TO CONTINUE I

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:26.888 region:rollup2
DON'T I REALLY HAD A GOOD

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:27.789 region:rollup2
REASON?

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:28.890 region:rollup2
FOR ALLOWING THAT.

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:30.058 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:30.825 region:rollup2
THE LOGISTICS.

01:30:30.058 --> 01:30:32.927 region:rollup2
PROVEN

01:30:30.825 --> 01:30:34.029 region:rollup2
HE ARE

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:35.530 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE ARE THE PROJECT

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:36.398 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT HISTORICALLY THE

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:38.533 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS APPROVED THE

01:30:36.398 --> 01:30:40.902 region:rollup2
PLAN AND NOT REQUIRED FIFTH OUT

01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:41.336 region:rollup2
TO COME BACK AND LAST THERE'S A

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:42.504 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND SO. THE.

01:30:41.336 --> 01:30:43.838 region:rollup2
.

01:30:42.504 --> 01:30:45.840 region:rollup2
USUALLY IT'S BEEN CUT OF A FEW

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:47.375 region:rollup2
YEARS THE LAST TIME THE FIST CAO

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:51.613 region:rollup2
KY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WITHIN

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:53.348 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN.

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:55.917 region:rollup2
IF I COULD JUST WOULD SUGGEST

01:30:53.348 --> 01:30:58.453 region:rollup2
HOW LUDICROUS IT SILENCED US

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:59.821 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE APPROVING.

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:00.889 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:02.557 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY IN YOU'RE

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:03.792 region:rollup2
SAYING WELL WE HAVE AND YOU HAVE

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:04.392 region:rollup2
AN HAD COME BACK TO US AND YET

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:06.361 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GETTING THE RESULTS

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:07.429 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANT. AND MY GUESS IS IF

01:31:06.361 --> 01:31:08.596 region:rollup2
THE START OF THE TWO THOUSAND

01:31:07.429 --> 01:31:10.665 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN THE TECHNOLOGIES PEARLY

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:11.866 region:rollup2
OUTDATED AT THIS POINT RIGHT TWO

01:31:10.665 --> 01:31:12.167 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWO THOUSAND

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.668 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE.

01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:15.270 region:rollup2
