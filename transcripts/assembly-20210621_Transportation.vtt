01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:10.445
VEHICLE EXHAUST IS NOT ONLY

01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:12.013
TOXIC IN IN RELEASING TOXIC

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.081
POLLUTANTS BUT IS ONE OF THE

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:14.482
MAIN DRIVERS. OF CARBON

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:16.484
EMISSIONS I WILL HELP US TO

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:17.652

GASOLINE POWERED CARS BY TWENTY

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:29.764
THIRTY FIVE. THE TENNESSEE

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.399
ECKELS ARE OUR FUTURE AND THERE

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:32.667
ON THE HORIZON SOONER THAN WE

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:35.336
THINK- AND DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:37.271
CHANGES- THEY CAN CLEARLY BE

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:38.639
PART OF A CLEAN EQUITABLE

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:40.808
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. PROVIDED

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:42.376
THAT THEY ARE ZERO EMISSIONS

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:43.745
AND HELP TO SUPPORT A MULTI

01:29:43.811 --> 01:29:45.780
MODAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WE

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:47.648
NEED SMART POLICIES TO HELP

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:49.817
STEER AV DEPLOYMENT. ALONG WITH

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:50.918
OTHER PARTS OF OUR TRANSIT

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.553
SYSTEM TOWARDS A SHARED YOUR

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.889
MISSION FUTURE. WHICH IS WHY WE

01:29:54.956 --> 01:29:57.158
HAVE INTRODUCED THIS BILL- AV

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.960
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT SOMETHING

01:29:59.026 --> 01:30:00.027
THAT IS SCIENCE FICTION AT THIS

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:01.529
POINT BUT A REALITY OF THE VERY

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:03.498
NEAR FUTURE- AS YOU PROBABLY

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:04.866
ALL KNOW WE HAVE OUR FIRST ADDS

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:06.634
ON THE ROAD ALREADY. AND MANY

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:08.469
MORE WILL BE ON THE WAY. THEY

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:10.304
CAN EITHER BE CONTRIBUTORS TO

01:30:10.371 --> 01:30:11.506
MORE CARBON EMISSIONS OR THEY

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:14.008
CAN HELP TO STEER OUR FLEET. OF

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.409
TRANSPORTATION IN THE STATE

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:16.944
TOWARDS YOUR EMISSIONS. BUT WE

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:18.546
ALSO KNOW THAT THE HARDWARE IS

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:20.615
ALREADY HERE- I PURCHASED MY

01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:22.550
OWN FIRST HYDROGEN FUEL CELL

01:30:22.617 --> 01:30:25.019
CAR JUST A WEEK AGO. AND WE

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:26.220
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:27.555
WAY OUT THERE THE HARDWARE IS

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:28.856
OUTPACING THE SOFTWARE AT THIS

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:31.025
POINT. IS MUCH EASIER TO GET A

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:31.993
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TODAY

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:33.094
THAN TO GET AN AUTOMATED

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.462
VEHICLE. AND I THINK IT MAKES

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:35.596
COMMON SENSE IT'S GOOD

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:37.331
PRECEDENT TO SET BEFORE WE

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:38.800
DEPLOY A LOT OF ATVS ON THE

01:30:38.866 --> 01:30:41.135
ROAD. TO REQUIRE THAT THE B.

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.703
ZERO MISSION. THIS MEASURE

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:44.672
SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:45.606

LABOR GROUPS- THOMAS VEHICLES

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:49.110
MAY BE ABLE TO DRIVE THEMSELVES

01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:50.511
BUT WE NEED TO STEER THEM IN

01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:52.480
THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO- I URGE

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:53.614

BE DEPLOYED AS EUROVISION

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:34.355
VEHICLE- AS I MENTIONED

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:35.857
PREVIOUSLY EASIER TO SEE THE

SOLVE OUR PLANET'S MOST

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:43.364
PRESSING PROBLEMS. EXPERT

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:44.799
CONSENSUS THAT ELECTRIFYING A

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:46.167
VISA IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:47.435
COMPONENTS TO ENSURING THAT

01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:47.935
THEY'RE A PART OF THE

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.704
SUSTAINABLE- PART OF OUR

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.072
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. FOR

01:31:51.138 --> 01:31:53.541
EXAMPLE RECENT RESEARCH BY UC

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:54.809
DAVIS FOUND THAT PERSONALLY

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:56.477
OWNED AB IS ARE LIKELY TO

01:31:56.544 --> 01:31:58.246
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE VEHICLE

01:31:58.312 --> 01:31:59.647
MILES TRAVELED WITH A LARGE

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:01.015
PORTION OF THOSE MILD COMING

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:02.016
WINDOW PASSENGERS IN THE

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.484
VEHICLE. THEY ALSO FOUND THAT

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:05.119
EITHER LIKELY TO SHIFT PEOPLE

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.687
AWAY FROM LOWER EMISSION THOUGH

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:08.623
IT'S LIKE PUBLIC TRANSIT. UCS

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:09.557
RESEARCH FOUND THAT THE

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:10.591
POTENTIAL FOR EIGHTIES TO

01:32:10.658 --> 01:32:11.792
INCREASE EMISSIONS AND AIR

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:13.561
POLLUTION EVEN IN A SCENARIO

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:15.129
WHERE POLICIES ENCOURAGE

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:16.364
PULLING IN TRANSIT. OUR

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:17.498
RESEARCH ALSO FOUND THAT

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:18.966
NEGATIVE IMPACTS SUCH AS

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:20.568
CONGESTION AIR POLLUTION WERE

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:21.035
LIKELY TO HAPPEN

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:22.136
DISPROPORTIONATELY IN

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:25.306
COMMUNITIES ALREADY

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:25.840
EXPERIENCING ENVIRONMENTAL

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:26.440
INJUSTICES. WE CAN ALSO FROM

01:32:26.507 --> 01:32:27.975
THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF RIDE

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:29.777
HAILING WHICH UCS AND CARD HAVE

01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:31.279
FOUND TO INCREASE EMISSIONS

01:32:31.345 --> 01:32:32.546
COMPARED TO PERSONAL CARDS.

01:32:32.613 --> 01:32:34.215
ACCORDING TO UCS ANALYSIS THE

01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:35.917
AVERAGE RIDE HAILING TRIP IS

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:37.585
69% MORE POLLUTING THAN THE

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:38.819
TRAINS THEY REPLACE. THESE

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:40.254
REPORTS AND OTHERS HIGHLIGHT

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:41.656
THE NEED TO DEPLOY AB IS AS

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:42.857
THAT IN ORDER TO MITIGATE

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:44.625
EMISSIONS IMPACT. AS PART OF A

01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:45.960
BROADER STRATEGY TO REDUCE

01:32:46.027 --> 01:32:47.695
EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION.

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:48.696
THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.531
CALIFORNIA POLICIES CLEAR WE

01:32:50.598 --> 01:32:51.465
ARE MOVING TOWARD A ZERO

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:52.934
EMISSION TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.036
AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES LIKE.

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:55.970
AUTOMATED VEHICLES SHOULD BE

01:32:56.037 --> 01:32:57.838
LEADING THE WAY. THIS BILL IS

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:58.306
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER

01:32:58.372 --> 01:33:00.875
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. SUCH AS THE

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:02.109

EMISSION AV IS AS PART OF ITS

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:12.420
FIRST GUIDING PRINCIPLE. THAT

CLEAN MILE STANDARD APPROVED A

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:15.623
MONTH AGO TODAY BY CARD THAT

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:19.894
REQUIRES RIDE. HAILING VEHICLES

WANT REMAIN AGNOSTIC ON THE

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:24.538
TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:26.206
USED TO POWER THESE CARS. WE

01:42:26.273 --> 01:42:27.307
REALLY DO WANT AN EASIER

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:28.809
MISSION SO WE WANT THAT PROCESS

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:30.511
TO START NOW THIS BILL GIVES

01:42:30.577 --> 01:42:32.279
THEM PLENTY OF FOREWARNING AS

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:34.014
THEIR TESTING AND I SHOULD NOTE

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:35.549
THAT THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON

01:42:35.616 --> 01:42:37.751
TESTING AB TECHNOLOGY ON GAS

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:39.453
POWERED CARS. IT'S JUST THAT

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.255
WHEN THEY DEPLOY- THEY ARE

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:42.456
REQUIRED TO BE ZERO EMISSIONS

01:42:42.523 --> 01:42:44.358
BY TWENTY THIRTY OR LATER AND I

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:46.059
THINK THAT IS A WORTHWHILE GOAL

01:42:46.126 --> 01:42:47.361
BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED THERE

01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:48.695
IS SIGNIFICANT CONCERN THAT

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:51.098
ABC. WILL ACTUALLY ADD

01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:52.165
SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:53.233
PASSENGER VEHICLE MILES

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:55.669
TRAVELED BUT ON TOP OF THAT WE

01:42:55.736 --> 01:42:56.570
ARE TRYING TO GET TO ZERO

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:58.038
EMISSIONS THESE ARE NOT CARS

01:42:58.105 --> 01:42:59.206
THAT ARE MEANT TO BE CHEAP DATE

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:00.541
THAT YOU AVOID A LOT OF THE

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:02.776
EQUITY CONCERNS- THAT HAVE.

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:03.944
GUIDED SOME OF OUR DECISIONS

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:06.780
WITH YOUR- IT MANDATES IN OTHER

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.448
AREAS- THESE ARE GOING TO BE

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.717
HIGH PRICE WHETHER THEY'RE FOR-

01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:12.252
YOU KNOW WITH- THOSE WERE

01:43:12.319 --> 01:43:13.487
TRYING TO BE FIRST EARLY

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:16.890
ADOPTERS OR- THE RIDE SHARING

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:18.792
MEANT TO BE CHEAP AND SO I

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:20.561
DON'T SEE ANY GOOD REASONS WHY

01:43:20.627 --> 01:43:22.195
THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALL YOUR

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:23.230
MISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:43:23.297 --> 01:43:24.097
THAT'S THE TREND ALREADY WE'RE

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:25.699
JUST GIVING IT A LITTLE PUSH.

01:43:25.766 --> 01:43:27.000
IN THE BACK HERE TO TRY TO MAKE

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:28.168
SURE THAT THERE ARE NO OUT

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:30.404
LIARS- FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:31.939
WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE CARBON

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:32.472
EMISSIONS RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:34.541
SEEING. RIGHT NOW HOW URGENT IT

01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:36.209
IS I THINK TO GET TO ZERO

01:43:36.276 --> 01:43:36.944
EMISSIONS AS QUICKLY AS

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.445
POSSIBLE I THINK THIS IS A

01:43:38.512 --> 01:43:40.380
PROMISING TECHNOLOGY. AND AS

01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:42.082
FAR AS YOUR SECOND QUESTION YOU

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:43.717
KNOW I ACTUALLY DUG DEEP ON

01:43:43.784 --> 01:43:44.685
THIS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:46.019
BE SOMEBODY THAT WAS STANDING

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:48.055
IN THE WAY OF THE TECHNOLOGY OR

01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:50.090
INNOVATION- BUT I COULD NOT

01:43:50.157 --> 01:43:52.092
HEAR A SINGLE ACTUAL. CREDIBLE

01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:53.627
EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS WAS

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:55.963
DISRUPTING ANY KIND OF- PLANS

01:43:56.029 --> 01:43:57.531
BECAUSE MOST THESE COMPANIES

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:58.865
ARE EITHER ON HYBRIDS OR ZERO

01:43:58.932 --> 01:44:03.870
EMISSIONS ALREADY. AND. IT'S

01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:05.205
NOT A HUGE STRETCH TO. MOVE TWO

01:44:05.272 --> 01:44:05.772
ZERO. THE TECHNOLOGY ALREADY

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:06.373
THERE. AND CERTAINLY I WOULD

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.308
HOPE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY FOR

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:09.876
ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES. IN THE

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:11.278
NEXT EIGHT YEARS WILL CONTINUE

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:13.814
TO PROCEED- ADAM AT THE PACE

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:14.748
HAS BEEN PROCEEDING AT OR MORE

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:16.717
RAPIDLY. IN WHICH CASE I DON'T

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:17.618
THINK THIS WILL BE AT ALL A

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:19.219
STRETCH FOR THOMAS VEHICLES TO

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:20.153
DEPLOY THEIR SOFTWARE

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.722
ESSENTIALLY. ONTO THEIR

01:44:21.788 --> 01:44:23.757
MISSIONS PLATFORM. SO I DON'T

01:44:23.824 --> 01:44:24.791
KNOW IF THAT IS RESPONSIVE YOUR

01:44:24.858 --> 01:44:26.426
QUESTION VICE CHAIR. NO

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:27.628
ABSOLUTELY I THINK I THINK THAT

01:44:27.694 --> 01:44:29.529
I THINK THAT- I CERTAINLY

01:44:29.596 --> 01:44:30.797
APPRECIATE THAT SENTIMENT I

01:44:30.864 --> 01:44:33.500
THINK- I THINK. YOU AND I MAY

01:44:33.567 --> 01:44:35.035
HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IN

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:36.937
TERMS OF JUST. ALLOWING

01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:40.007
EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TO- TO

01:44:40.073 --> 01:44:43.510
PROCEED OR TO BE TWO TO. FOUR

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:45.345
TO KIND OF. THRIVE AND PROSPER

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:46.680
IN A YOU AND I DON'T KNOW I

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:47.514
THINK WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:49.216
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT. TWO TO FIVE

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:49.850
YEARS WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF

01:44:49.916 --> 01:44:51.451
ADVANCEMENTS IN THIS SPACE.

01:44:51.518 --> 01:44:52.886
THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:55.689
PROJECT ARE NOW. AND FROM MY

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:56.857
PERSPECTIVE IT'S ALWAYS ONE OF

01:44:56.923 --> 01:44:59.660
THOSE- THOSE THOSE DICEY YEAH

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:02.829
DECISIONS TO BE ABLE TO PLACE A

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:04.998
MANDATE. OR PLACE ANY. AS

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:05.666
RIGIDITY INTO SOMETHING THAT WE

01:45:05.732 --> 01:45:07.634
DON'T KNOW. WHAT IT'S GOING TO

01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:08.669
WHAT'S GOING TO BE ALLOWED BUT-

01:45:08.735 --> 01:45:09.836
IT'S ONLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:10.971
I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL THIS

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:12.439
TIME BUT- AND SO THEY WANT TO

01:45:12.506 --> 01:45:14.441
CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ON

01:45:14.508 --> 01:45:17.110
THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY

01:45:17.177 --> 01:45:20.981
OTHER MEMBERS. WELL I WILL JUST

01:45:21.048 --> 01:45:22.582
ADD TO THAT I WANT TO FIRST

01:45:22.649 --> 01:45:23.850
THANK THE SENATOR FOR WORKING

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:26.386
ON THIS BILL FOR TAKING ON THIS

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:28.755
VERY HEAVY VERY LARGE TOPIC AND

01:45:28.822 --> 01:45:30.657
TO MOVING INTO PUSHING THIS

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.292
INDUSTRY AND IS A VERY

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:34.728
IMPORTANT DIRECTION- TO MAKE

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:37.531
SURE THAT- IT REALLY IS THE

01:45:37.597 --> 01:45:40.634
TYPE OF- OF VEHICLES ON THE

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.035
ROAD THAT WE ALL WANT AND I

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:42.936
WILL JUST TAKE A LITTLE ISSUE

01:45:43.003 --> 01:45:45.839
WITH WHAT MY VERY- THE STEAM TO

01:45:45.906 --> 01:45:47.174
VICE CHAIR SAID. THE EMERGING

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.177
TECHNOLOGY HERE IS THE SOFTWARE

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:51.278
AND SENSORS IT IS NOT THE

01:45:51.344 --> 01:45:54.848
ENGINE- THE ENGINE SHOULD BE AS

01:45:54.915 --> 01:45:56.249
ADVANCED AS EVERYTHING ELSE

01:45:56.316 --> 01:45:57.417
THAT'S GOING ON THESE VEHICLES

01:45:57.484 --> 01:45:59.286
AND THAT IS AB TECHNOLOGY AND

01:45:59.352 --> 01:46:00.721
THAT IS ALREADY HERE AND

01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:02.889
ALREADY BEING DEPLOYED SO THAT

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:05.659
REALLY ISN'T A STRETCH- BUT

01:46:05.726 --> 01:46:07.861
UNLIKE A TYPICAL CAR WHICH YOU

01:46:07.928 --> 01:46:08.562
KNOW IF IT'S BOUGHT FOR

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:09.696
PERSONAL USE IT MAKES IT IN THE

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:11.598
GARAGE A LOT OF TIME THESE

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:12.632
VEHICLES ARE NOT GOING TO BE

01:46:12.699 --> 01:46:13.467
THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE PURCHASED

01:46:13.533 --> 01:46:14.735
TO BE WERE COURSE VEHICLES ARE

01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:16.536
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. AND

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:17.571
THEY'RE GOING TO BE RIDE SHARE

01:46:17.637 --> 01:46:18.472
VEHICLES THAT ARE GONNA BE ON

01:46:18.538 --> 01:46:20.073
THE STREET ALL THE TIME BUT

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.074
THEY'RE GOING TO BE TRUCKS THAT

01:46:21.141 --> 01:46:21.908
ARE GOING TO BE ON THE STREET

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:24.511
ALL THE TIME AND WHEN THOSE

01:46:24.578 --> 01:46:26.079
BUYERS MAKE THE INVESTMENT IN

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:27.748
THESE VEHICLES THEY'RE GOING TO

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:30.350
SQUEEZE EVERY YEAR AND EVERY

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.119
MILE OUT OF THE VEHICLES THEY

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:34.221
CAN'T THEY WILL FAR EXCEED. THE

01:46:34.287 --> 01:46:35.756
MILEAGE AND THE USE OF A

01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:37.691
TYPICAL PASSENGER VEHICLE AND

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:38.658
THAT'S WHY IT'S EVEN MORE

01:46:38.725 --> 01:46:40.527
IMPORTANT THAT THE BEVS BECAUSE

01:46:40.594 --> 01:46:42.028
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON OUR

01:46:42.095 --> 01:46:43.697
STREETS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY

01:46:43.764 --> 01:46:45.132
THEY DON'T REST PLUGIN HUMAN

01:46:45.198 --> 01:46:46.833
DRIVER THEY COULD EASILY BE

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.769
DRIVING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:50.036
SO THEY MUST BE EV'S BECAUSE

01:46:50.103 --> 01:46:51.505
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A MUCH

01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:53.573
LARGER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:56.076
THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF VEHICLE.

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:57.477
SO I THINK THIS IS VERY VERY

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:58.945
IMPORTANT I WILL SAY THE ONE

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:00.013
MOMENT THAT YOU'RE TAKING THAT

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.882
I WAS SORRY TO SEE YOU TAKE WAS

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:04.251
THE LOWERING OF THE- THE WEIGHT

01:47:04.317 --> 01:47:06.386
LIMIT- TO CAPTURE LESS OF THOSE

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:08.488
LARGE HEAVY VEHICLES BUT I

01:47:08.555 --> 01:47:09.156
THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY A

01:47:09.222 --> 01:47:10.257
COMPROMISE THAT WE CAN ALL LIVE

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:11.191
WITH AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:12.659
WE COULD REVISIT THIS INDUSTRY

01:47:12.726 --> 01:47:13.693
IS NOT SHOWING THAT THEY'RE

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.295
MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:16.163
AND MAKING THOSE LARGER

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:20.934
VEHICLES B. BV'S WE CAN ALWAYS

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:21.902
COME BACK. TO THAT. NEXT YEAR

01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:22.736
THE AFTER THE AFTER THAT SO BE

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.337
CERTAINLY WATCHING THAT TO SEE

01:47:24.404 --> 01:47:26.139
WHAT THE INDUSTRY DOES. BUT I'M

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:28.041
HAPPY TO SEE EV'S. I'M SORRY

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:29.643
BEING DEPLOYED AND I'M VERY

01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:31.211
GRATEFUL FOR YOU TO TAKING THIS

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:32.746
ON AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK.

01:47:32.813 --> 01:47:33.880
THE OPPOSITION THAT'S NOW MOVED

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:35.816
TO A NEUTRAL POSITION. WE

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:36.416
APPRECIATE THEM STRETCHING FOR

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:38.752
THIS AS WELL. I DO WE HAVE A

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:40.487
MOTION- BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:47:40.554 --> 01:47:42.455
CLOSE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:43.523
MAKING THE CASE MORE ELOQUENTLY

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:45.225
THAN I DID WE DIDN'T WANT TO

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:46.493
TAKE THE AMENDMENT BUT-

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.794
COMPROMISE REQUIRES HARD

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:49.629
SACRIFICES SOMETIMES. THE ONE

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:51.898
THING I WOULD JUST- NOTE THIS

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:52.933
IS NOT. A THIS IS TECHNOLOGY

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:54.134
AGNOSTIC SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO

01:47:54.201 --> 01:47:55.569
BE EV'S IT ALSO CAN BE OTHER

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:56.670
FORMS OF ZERO EMISSIONS

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:57.938
VEHICLES. BOTH THAT I

01:47:58.004 --> 01:47:59.372
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

01:47:59.439 --> 01:48:00.073
SORRY AND YOU'RE RIGHT I WAS

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:01.374
USING THAT TERM INCORRECTLY

01:48:01.441 --> 01:48:02.375
WE'VE TRIED HERE I SHOULD NOT

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:03.877
BE DOING. BUT CERTAINLY THE

01:48:03.944 --> 01:48:08.215
PRESENTS WE ALL MAKE THAT STEP-

01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:09.049
I DO WE HAVE A MOTION. AND WE

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:10.217
HAD A SECOND OKAY THANK YOU

01:48:10.283 --> 01:48:12.419
WITH THAT LET'S TAKE RECALL.

01:48:12.485 --> 01:48:13.286
THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS

01:48:13.353 --> 01:48:14.654
AMENDED TO COMMUNICATIONS AND

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:17.424
CONVEYANCE FRIEDMAN. HI
