B. FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR ALLOWED THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO IMPOUND VEHICLES UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION. AND AUTHORITY RECOMMENDED IN TWO AUDITS OF P. UC'S TRANSPORTATION ENFORCEMENT BRANCH HOWEVER IS CLEARLY POINTED OUT IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS SUCH AS THE FOURTH AMENDMENT CONCERNS. EXISTING STATUTE ALLOWS THE CPUC TO SEEK IMPOUND ORDERS TO RECORD. THE CPUC HAS REPEATEDLY STATED Y. THESE CURRENT STATUTES STATUTES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PROPERLY ENFORCED CARRIERS. THESE REASONS INCLUDED DESIRE TO CONDUCT ON THE SPOT IMPOUNDMENTS GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE VEHICLES THAT CP YOU SEE RICK REGULATES. AND AN INABILITY TO PAY FOR OVERTIME FOR PEACE OFFICERS TO ENFORCE VIOLATIONS OF CPUC RULES. THE CURRENT AMENDMENTS TO SP FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR ADDRESSES THIS LAST CONCERNED BY ALLOWING THE COMMISSION. CONTRACT WITH C. U. CH P. OR SHERIFF'S TO ENFORCE IMPOUNDMENT OTHER STATE AGENCIES LIKE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ALSO HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO CONTRACT WITH C. H. P. OR SHARES FOR IMPOUNDMENTS WHICH SEEMS APPROPRIATE. TO ALLOW THE CPUC TO DO SIMILARLY THE CPUC TRANSPORTATION BRANCH ASSESSES A FEE ON ALL THE ENTITIES THEY REGULATE. THIS FEE IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT A SURPLUS COVER THE COST OF SUCH CONTRACTING COLLEAGUES THE S. TO SEEP UC'S TRANSPORTATION BRANCH HAS UNDERTAKEN A NUMBER OF CHANGES OVER THE YEARS. ALL IN AN EFFORT TO STREAMLINE THE PROGRAM AND ALLOW FOR THEM TO DO THEIR JOBS BETTER. ALLOWING THE CPUC TO CONTRACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO UPHOLD THE VIOLATIONS OF THE CPUC RULES.

IT'S VERY POSSIBLE [inaudible] OF TWENTY BUT KNOW QUICK CORRECTION ON SB ONE EIGHTY THREE IT GOES TO JUDICIARY OFFICE [inaudible] RIGHT THERE [inaudible] THURMOND AND YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON AN AD. SEE IS ME FOR BEING LATE I WAS VERY PREGNANT IN THE HALL THEY WOULD LET ME AND BUT I'M HERE NOW. I AM DOCTOR WE UNDER CLARK HARVEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES WE REPRESENT OVER SEVENTY FIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE SOME OF WHICH PROVIDE. SUBSTANCE USED TO DISORDER TREATMENT AND OF COURSE WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT OUR AGENCIES ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN INCLUDING ASSISTING INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS MANAGE THEIR CAN DISH AND WITH APPROPRIATE IN AN INTENSIVE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. INTERVENTION STRATEGIES AND THIS CAN INCLUDE PARTICIPATION RESIDENCYPROGRAMS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PATIENT IN RECOVERY FROM SUBSTANCE USE RIGHT THERE MOST VULNERABLE PERIOD OF RELAPSE IN THE FIRST FOUR YEARS AFTER TREATMENT. IT THAT'S EXACTLY WHEN PATIENTS ARE MEDICINE LESS PRACTICES THIS WOULD INCLUDE PATIENT BROKERING AN INSURANCE FRAUD COMMITTED BY TREATMENT PROVIDERS. THIS VULNERABILITY TO RELAPSE AND ABUSES HEIGHTENS WHEN WE LOOK AT PEOPLE BEING RELEASED FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ESTIMATES CITED IN THE US SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT RECENTLY INDICATE THAT HALF OF THE NATIONAL PRETTY PRISON POPULATION HAS AN ACTIVE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SO HAVING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE -- RESIDENCIES -- AND HAVING PATIENT PROTECTIONS IS CRITICAL UPON RELEASE WE URGE YOU TO VOTE I AM AS MUCH OR THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES OF SUPPORT. TIFFANY FAN BEHALF OF RECOVERY FROM NOW IN SUPPORT [inaudible] A POSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KIRK CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. REGRETFULLY WE DO HAVE TO OPPOSE -- THIS BILL WEEK WE'D. I APPRECIATE AND SUPPORT THE PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FOR PATIENTS' BROKERING WE THINK THAT IS A PRACTICE THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE -- SEEKING AND RECEIVING TREATMENT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE PROVISIONS THAT CREATE A CERTIFICATION PROGRAM -- WITH IN -- SOBER LIVING RESIDENCES AND AND INDEED DOES NOT ARE RESIDENCES -- PROTECTED UNDER BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING LAW FOR ANY RESIDENTS UNDER SIX AND UNDER THERE CANNOT BE RESTRICTIONS ON THOSE -- HOMES THOSE RESIDENCES THAT IMPACT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE INDEED PERSONS WITH A DISABILITIES. SO FOR THAT REASON EVEN THOUGH THAT IS A PROVISION THAT IS VOLUNTARY WE STILL BELIEVE THAT IT -- CROSSES THE LINE ON FAIR HOUSING LAW BY RESTRICTING THOSE -- HOUSING -- OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS. SO WE OPPOSE LIKE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. K. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE COURT -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH NEEDED [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I I WANTED TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE WITNESS SO WE'RE GONNA. SEE IF WE CAN BRING IT BACK. I YEAH I JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR THE I'LL OPPOSITION WITNESS SIDE COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT YOU THINK THE NEGATIVE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE ON THESE FACILITIES -- UNDER SIX PEOPLE AND YOU SAID IT'S VOLUNTARY BUT YOU STILL THINK IT'S GOING TO BE HARMFUL SO YOU JUST EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE YES -- SO IT'S A IT'S OUR VIEW CERTAINLY WHEN THERE ARE CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS THAT THEN PLACES A LABEL UPON THOSE THAT ARE CERTIFIED AND THOSE THAT AREN'T CERTIFIED. THOSE THAT ARE NOT CERTIFIED GET LABELED AS THE NOT CERTIFIED AND THEREFORE -- CARRY THE DETAINED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND ARE SUBJECT. TO BOTH WE THINK COMMUNITY -- DIRECTION AT THOSE -- AT THOSE HOMES SO IT IMPOSES THE A OPPORTUNITY. THIS BILL IMPOSES DENIES THE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR REFERRALS TO THOSE THAT CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE THE CERTIFICATION. OKAY SO IN THAT SENSE YOU CAN STILL OPERATE WERE YOU CAN ACCEPT REFERRALS IF YOU DON'T HAVE VOLUNTARILY GET THAT THE CERTIFICATION THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS [inaudible] WE GO. WERE IN OPPOSITION. THEY OPPOSITION THOUGH THEIR SUPPORT THIS KIND OF LONELY VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO THE ROOM. OTHERS MADNESS OUTSIDE -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO TESTIFY GO AHEAD [inaudible] TWO MINUTES THANK YOU. MY NAME IS BARBARA LODGE AND I LIVE IN WEST LOS ANGELES I'M HERE BECAUSE OF MY TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD SON WHO OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAS LIVE NOW COULD SPEAK LITTLE POTION MICROPHONES HARD TO AREA. THAT OVER. TO THANK YOU MY NAME IS BARBARA LODGE AND I LIVE IN WEST LOS ANGELES. I'M HERE BECAUSE MY TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD SON WHO OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAS LIVED IN THREE DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA RECOVERY RESIDENCES. WHEN HE DEVELOP SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER I COMMITTED ALL OF MY TIME AND ENERGY TO FINDING HIM HELP IN A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE? THE RECOVERY RESIDENTS WE CHOSE ASSURED US IT WOULD BE A STABLE AND SUPPORTIVE PLACE FOR HIM. BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. WITHIN IS FIRST MONTH MY SON'S TWO ROOMMATES RELAPSED ON HEROIN IN THEIR SHARED BATHROOM. THERE WAS SO MUCH CHAOS AND YELLING AND POLICE ACTIVITY IN HOUSE THAT MY SON FILLED TRIGGERED AN UNPROTECTED. HOUSE MANAGER CALLED AND ASKED ME TO PICK HIM UP IN ORDER TO KEEP HIM SAFE. IN ANOTHER INCIDENT IN ANOTHER RESIDENTS MY SONS CLOSE FRIEND AND ROOMMATE CRAIG. OVERDOSED ON HEROIN SMUGGLED IN BY A RESIDENT. AS THERE WAS NO NALOXONE ON SITE HE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL AND RESUSCITATED. HE IS NOW BRAIN DEAD FOR LACK OF OXYGEN. YET ANOTHER HOME SAID MY SON WOULD BENEFIT FROM DALY ONE ON ONE SESSIONS WITH A MENTOR. IN ADDITION TO THE THOUSANDS I WAS ALREADY PAIN PER MONTH THE MENTOR WOULD COST ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUR. DESPERATE TO TRY EVERYTHING I AGREED. WHEN I LEARNED THAT MENTORING EQUAL PLAYING TENNIS? AND CLOTHES SHOPPING RATHER THAN RESUME WRITING I CONTACTED THE FACILITY TO CANCEL. THE OFFICE OF PATIENT RETENTION INSTEAD RECOMMENDED AN INCREASE IN WEEKLY MENTORING HOURS. AND THERE WAS THIS WHILE I WAS PAYING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FROM MONTHLY DRUG TESTING. THE RESIDENTS WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY FILING TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIMS WITH MY INSURANCE FOR THE SAME DRUG TESTS. OUR STATES LACK OF OVERSIGHT FOR PEOPLE IN RECOVERY IS ASTOUNDING. WHEN A DEAR FRIEND'S DAUGHTER CHRISTIE RELAPSED IN HER RECOVERY RESIDENT SHE WAS SUMMARILY THROWN OUT? THE HOUSE MANAGER DIDN'T EVEN CALL HER PARENTS. AND THAT VERY NIGHT HOPELESS AND WITHOUT OPTIONS SHE STEPPED IN FRONT OF A MOVING TRAIN AND DIED. TRISTEN ANOTHER FRIEND'S TWENTY YEAR OLD SON OVERDOSED AND DIED ALONE IN HIS APARTMENT WITHIN HOURS OF GRADUATING FROM HIS RECOVERY RESIDENTS. WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT OVERLOOKS THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF SUCH PREVENTABLE DEATHS. WELL I'M NO EXPERT I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER. IT WASN'T UNTIL MY SON ADMITTED HIMSELF INTO A RESIDENTS RUN BY AN ETHICAL PROVIDER THAT HE FINALLY GOT THE SUPPORT HE NEEDED. THIS WAS NOT A FANCY PLACE THERE ARE NO EXPENSE OF MENTORS HE WAS THERE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST YEARS OF THEIR LIVES TO SUBSTANCE USE WHO HAD SPENT TIME IN PRISON AND LIVED ON THE STREETS. THESE INDIVIDUALS DID NOT TREAT HIM LIKE A GUY WITH A DOLLAR SIGN ON HIS BACK. THEY OFFERED HIM SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF RESPECT AND DECENCY AND THAT'S WHERE HIS RECOVERY REALLY BEGAN. WE NEED TO ENACT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT RECOVERY. SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR HEALTHIER THAN WHEN THEY ARRIVE. I SUPPORT SENATE BILL TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT BECAUSE WE NEED CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE THOUSANDS OF PARENTS AND PATIENTS WHO ARE DESPERATE FOR YOUR PROTECTION. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. GENERAL ELECTROLESS THANK YOU I MEAN YOU'VE HEARD THE STORIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. IT HAS BEEN. OKAY IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY -- MOVED AND SECONDED LET'S GOING TO CALL FOR THE VOTE. SP TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY AYE LACKEY AYE CARILLO. CARILLO BY KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I KILEY KILEY AYE QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. MEASURE PASSES CENTER THANK YOU MISTER. ONE MORE ITEM. YES S. B.. THIRTEEN NINETY ONE YOU MAKE IT WAS CHAIR MEMBERS S. B. THIRTEEN ANYONE PROHIBITS CHILDREN AGES OF FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN FROM BEING TRIED AS ADULTS IN CRIMINAL COURT. AND SUBSEQUENTLY SENT TO THE ADULT PRISON CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA YOUTH AGES FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN WHO COMMIT CRIMES CAN BE TRIED AS A CAN BE TRIED AS ADULTS AND SENTENCED TO ADULT PRISON. WE DIDN'T ALWAYS DO THIS HOWEVER THIS PRACTICE WAS STARTED IN THE NINETIES WHEN THE STATE WAS TRYING TO A SO CALLED BE. TOUGH ON CRIME -- BACK BACK THEN SOCIETY BELIEVE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WERE FULLY DEVELOPED AROUND THE AGE OF FOURTEEN NOW RESEARCH HAS THE PUNK THAT MYTH. COGNITIVE SCIENCE HAS PROVEN THAT CHILDREN AND ARE VERY CAPABLE OF CHANGE HOWEVER DUE TO THE YOUNG AGE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO MAKE POOR DECISIONS. SENDING YOU TO ADULT PRISON DOES NOT HOW ARE YOU AND IT DOES NOT MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES ANY SAFER IN FACT THE PRACTICE HAS DISPROPORTIONATE AFFECTED BLACK AND LATINO YOUTH. JUST OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS 50% OF LATINO YOUTH 60% OF BLACK YOU WERE SENT TO ADULT COURT AFTER TRANSFERRING I TRANSFER HEARING. COMPARED TO ONLY 10% OF WHITE YOUTH FOR SIMILAR CRIMES SOME YOUTH SENTENCED TO ADULT PRISON MAY HAVE COMMITTED. VERY SERIOUS CRIME BUT NOT THE MAJORITY OF THESE CASES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ABOUT 72% OF YOU. UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN WERE SENT TO ADULT COURT FOR NON HOMICIDE RELATED CRIMES SUCH AS BURGLARY ROBBERY AND ASSAULT. THE YOUNG IF TEENS IN OUR SYSTEM NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS BUT THEY'RE ALSO REQUIRE AGE APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS TO REHABILITATE AND GROW INTO HEALTHY MATURE ADULTS. KEEPING YOU UP IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM DOES NOT MEAN THEY GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST SOME OF THESE YOUTH MAY HAVE COMMITTED VERY SERIOUS CRIMES. AND THEY WILL BE PUNISHED THROUGH INCARCERATION AT DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE THIS IS STILL PRESENT MEMBERS JUST WITH AGE APPROPRIATE REHABILITATIVE SERVICES FOR YOUTH OFFENDERS. KEEPING YOUTH IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM MEAN THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE IN TREATMENT COUNSELING AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND EDUCATION. PEOPLE IN THE ADULT SYSTEM ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE IN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND MANY YOUNG PEOPLE SENTENCED TO ADULT PRISON DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO ANY TYPE. OF SERVICES WITH THE BENEFIT OF THE SERVICES YOUTH FAITH FROM USE WAY MUCH BETTER IN JUVENILE JUSTICE AND I'D LEFT LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES -- INTO IN THE FUTURE -- THIS BILL PRIORITIZE. PUBLIC SAFETY BY PROVIDING AGE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES AND EDUCATION TO VULNERABLE YOUTH EVEN WITH THE SERVICES OF A YOUNG PERSON IS STILL DEEMED A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS WHEN IT THAT WHEN IT IS TIME FOR THEM. TO AGE OUT OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THERE IS ALREADY A LAW THAT ALLOWS THEM TO REMAIN IN THE SYSTEM UNTIL DJJ DETERMINES THEY ARE NO LONGER A DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO SEND OUR YOUTH TO ADULT PRISONS WHERE THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. TO HELP THEM GROW TO HEALTHY MATURE ADULTS WE MUST REJECT THE LAWS OF THE NINETIES AND THAT HELPED PERPETUATE NEGATIVE RACIAL BIASES TOWARDS BLACK AND BROWN YOU. THIS LAW SAYS THAT CHILDREN ARE REDEEMABLE AND SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY THE WORST ACT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU -- GIVE WITNESS IN SUPPORT. FIVE MINUTES ALTOGETHER. THINK EACH I'M CHAIRPERSON JONES SAWYER HAND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IS MY HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE HI MY NAME IS MEGAN LA HAS GARCIA ARM A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO I JUST GRADUATED WITH MY BACHELORS DEGREE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE FROM UC RIVERSIDE. PRIOR TO THAT IRAN THREE ASSOCIATE DEGREES WELL WORKING THREE PART TIME JOBS. I VOLUNTEER MY COMMUNITY. AT WITH AT RISK YOUTH I INTERNED WITH AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. I AM A BOARD MEMBER ON THE NATIONAL COALITION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND THE YOUNGEST PERSON EVER APPOINTED AS COMMISSIONER OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY JUVENILE JUSTICE DELINQUENCY PREVENTION COMMITTEE. THIS SUMMER I WAS AWARDED A FELLOWSHIP TO WORK ON PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES AND I PLAN TO ATTEND LAW SCHOOL. WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN THOUGH? NOW FOR A SINGLE SECOND WOULD ANYONE HAVE GUESSED THAT I WOULD BE HERE WHERE I AM TODAY. I WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO GIVE UP ON AT FIFTEEN I SOLD DRUGS AYE VICTIMIZE PEOPLE. I LOOK TO THE STREET FOR RECOGNITION. AND I CARRIED A KNIFE READY TO USE IT. ONE DAY I MADE THE DECISION TO USE THAT KNIFE. AND SOMEONE ALMOST DIED. I WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER. AND FACE BEING TRIED AS AN ADULT. WHY WOULD HAVE LIKELY RECEIVED A LIFETIME SENTENCE IN PRISON? HOWEVER I WAS LUCKY. INSTEAD OF BEING TRIED AS AN ADULT WITH CAPTAINS JUVENILE SYSTEM HAS COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. BEING INCARCERATED IN BJJ WITH. WAS VERY DIFFICULT AS IT AS IT IS FOR ALL YOUTH. BECAUSE IT'S STILL PRESENT HOWEVER WHILE THERE I GOT HELP. THROUGHOUT MY CHILDHOOD MY FATHER WAS EXTREMELY A VERY ABUSIVE. I DJJ I RECEIVE COUNSELING I UNPACKED MY OWN PAIN ANGER AND SADNESS. I WAS MENTOR I CAME TO UNDERSTAND. THE IMPACT I HOW MY VICTIM AND MY COMMUNITY. I WAS REQUIRED TO BE IN SCHOOL AND I FOUND LOVE FOR IT. I WAS TREATED LIKE A CHILD I WAS SOMEONE WHO NEEDED A CHANCE TO GROW AND LEARN. AS BE THIRTEEN NINETY ONE WOULD MEAN THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT TURN THEIR BACK ON FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS WHO MAKE A TERRIBLE DECISION BUT INSTEAD GIVEN THE CHANCE. I WASN'T IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT CALIFORNIA KEPT EVERY SINGLE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLD IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. NOW WE HAVE HORRIBLE RACIAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISPARITY AND HOW FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS. ARE TREATED. AND IT'S JUST NOT ABOUT IT THE INDIVIDUAL YOUTH RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TRYING. YOUTH AS ADULTS IS BAD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE BEING TRIED AS AN ADULT. ARE BEING TRIED AS ADULTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT NEW CRIMES. THE CHANCE I GOT ALLOWED ME TO GROW INTO THE MAN I AM. THE THING I'M ARM PROUDEST OF LIFE IS BEING A FATHER TO MY ONE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER I THINK SOMEDAY. SHE'LL BE GRATEFUL TO THAT HER FATHER HAD A CHANCE TO BECOME THE MAN HE IS. AS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU MAX THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON JONES SAWYER COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS VALERIE THOMPSON I'M THE ASSISTANT CHIEF PROBATION SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. PRIOR TO THAT I WAS WITH THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I HAVE THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN CONTRIBUTING TO BUILDING SUCCESSFUL YOU PROBATION SYSTEMS AND STABILIZING YOU AND COMMUNITIES. I'M HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE BECAUSE THE PRACTICE OF SENTENCING YOUTH AGED FIFTEEN AND YOUNGER AS ADULTS MUST THE SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE WILL ENSURE THAT WE BOTH HOLD YOUTH ACCOUNTABLE AND SUPPORT THEM. CALIFORNIA'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF YOU TO MAKE MISTAKES EVEN BIG MISTAKES. FOR YOU TO COMMIT SERIOUS CRIMES THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE PROVIDES EVIDENCE BASED THERAPEUTIC SERVICES. THAT SUPPORT YOUTH [inaudible] ACCESS. YOU CAN BE HELD THAT DJJ UNTIL TWENTY FIVE FOR FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD THAT MEANS TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS OF THE BENEFIT FROM AGE APPROPRIATE THERAPEUTIC SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS. AND EDUCATION AFFECT THE LAW REQUIRES THAT YOUTH PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS EDUCATION WHILE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN CONTRAST YOU SENATE'S TO ADULT PRISON ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY REHABILITATION. THE ADULT SYSTEMS REHABILITATIVE SERVICES PALE IN COMPARISON TO THOSE OF THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SYSTEM OF ALL OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE NIFTY CAN'T TRAUMA. F. 5275% HAVE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS THESE YOU'VE DESERVED TO GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. WE ALSO CAN'T IGNORE THE PERVASIVE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS AS ADULTS. AND CALIFORNIA FOR EVERY TEN WHITE YOUTH WITH THE TRANSFER HEARING ONE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT. FOR EVERY BLACK YOUTH SIX WERE TRANSFERRED AND FOR LATINO YOUTH. FIVE WERE TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT. PERHAPS POLICYMAKERS SHOULD USE WHAT WE CALL THE MACHO WORLD WOULD YOU WANT YOUR FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SENATE SEVEN ADULT. I THINK NOT. I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS EQUIPPED TO HELP USE TRANSITION INTO ADULTHOOD WITH LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES THAN THOSE OF ADULTS. MY COUNTY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REHABILITATED YOU'VE CHARGED WITH VERY SERIOUS OFFENSES. ONE EXAMPLE OF THE BOY WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR MURDER AT FOURTEEN FAITH FLIGHT FACED LIFE IN ADULT PRISON INSTEAD WE RETAINED HIM IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. NOW HE IS OUT WILL GRADUATE FROM UC DAVIS IN THE FALL. ACROSS CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY OTHER FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS WHO DID NOT GET THAT CHANCE OVER ONE THOUSAND AND TEN YEARS WERE SENTENCED TO ADULT COURT. SUPREME COURT DECISIONS EMBRACE THE DOCTRINE OF DEVELOPMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHILDREN AND ADULTS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU HAVE A GREATER CAPACITY FOR CHANGE. NEUROSCIENCE HAS CONFIRMED WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS HAVE A LOT OF GROWING UP TO DO. IT IS TIME FOR THE CALIFORNIA LAW TO REFLECT THESE FACTS AND RESTORE SENSIBLE BALANCE TO OUR LAWS. RECOGNIZING THAT YOUNGER CHILDREN SIMPLY SHOULD NOT BE OBJECTED TO THE SUBJECT TO THE ADULT SYSTEM. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU BOB DEFINE MINISTER UP IT DID YOU HAVE ONE MORE WITNESS OR ITS GOOD OKAY. EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN SUPPORT NAME AND ORGANIZATION. M.

COULD YOU MAKE SOME ROOM THANK YOU [inaudible] YES. IT'S STILL MORNING GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY TOMAR TALCOTT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. IN THE LA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLD JUVENILES WHO COMMIT CRIMES INCLUDING SERIOUS CRIMES SHOULD BE HANDLED WITHIN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND IN THAT REGARD WERE ABSOLUTELY IN AGREEMENT WITH SENATOR LARA. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT FITNESS HEARINGS TO TRANSFER -- A JUVENILE TOOK CRIMINAL COURT SHOULD BE A RARE OCCURRENCE AND IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IT IS ABSOLUTELY A VERY RARE OCCURRENCE. HOWEVER THERE ARE CASES WERE ALL PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS AT REHABILITATING THE MINOR HAVE FAILED AND A FITNESS HEARING IN JUVENILE COURT BECOMES NECESSARY TO GIVE THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGE THE DISCRETION TO DECIDE -- TO TRANSFER THE MINOR TO CRIMINAL COURT OR TO NOT TRANSFER THE MINOR TO CRIMINAL COURT IT WOULD BE UP TO THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGE AND IT WOULD BE OUGHT TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. FOR EXAMPLE A LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HANDLED THE CASE OF A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD JUVENILE WHO HAD BEEN ON PROBATION TO THE JUVENILE COURT. AND WHILE HE WAS ON PROBATION TO THE JUVENILE COURT HE WAS LIVING NEXT DOOR TO AN EIGHTY SIX YEAR OLD DISABLED LADY. THOUGHT HE KNEW SHE LIVED ALONE. ONE NIGHT HE BROKE INTO HER HOME HE STOLE SOME ITEMS HE LEFT AND THEN CAME BACK THROUGH THE WINDOW AGAIN. AND THIS TIME SHE WOKE UP SO HE GRABBED A KNIFE AND STABBED HER TO DEATH. HE THEN LEFT. AND WITHIN THE SAME NIGHT CAME BACK BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN A LAPTOP IN HER KITCHEN. THAT HE WANTED TO TAKE AND HE TOOK IT AND HE LEFT. AND HE ALSO LATER ADMITTED THAT HE KNEW SHE'D LIVED ALONE AND THAT'S WHY HE TARGETED HER. WE ALSO HANDLED THE CASE OF A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD FEMALE MINOR. SHE WAS LIVING WITH HER DAD AND SHE WAS LIVING WITH HER GRANDPARENTS. AND SHE AND HER BOYFRIEND HAD BEEN A STEALING MONEY FROM THE GRANDPARENTS IN FACT THEY'VE BEEN USING OF THEIR CHECKS AND THEY'D BEEN WRITING CHECKS ó ON THE GRANDPARENTS ACCOUNT WITHOUT PERMISSION. AND WHEN THEY WERE DISCOVERED THE SHE DECIDED SHE WANTED TO KILL THE GRANDPARENTS. AND THE FIRST NIGHT THEY WENT INTO THE GRANDPARENTS BEDROOM BUT THE DOG STARTED BARKING. SO THEY LEFT THE NEXT NIGHT THEY TRIED AGAIN. THIS TIME THEY CAME BACK BOTH OF THEM ARMED WITH KNIVES A THE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD FEMALE MINOR STABBED HER GRANDMOTHER ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE TIMES. AND SHE KILLED HER GRANDMOTHER. HER BOYFRIEND STABBED THE GRANDFATHER FORTY SEVEN TIMES KILLING HIM. BOTH OF THE ELDERLY VICTIMS FELL OUT OF BED [inaudible] AND THE TWO INDIVIDUALS THEN PICKED UP THE GRANDPARENTS AND PUT THEM BACK INTO BED WITH THE INTENTION OF MAKING IT SEEM AS THOUGH THEY WERE STILL ASLEEP. THEY THEN RAN AWAY AND THEY WERE SEEN DESTROYING EVIDENCE ON A STORAGE FACILITY. WE ALSO HANDLE THE CASE OF A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD MINOR WHO WAS AN ACTIVE GANG MEMBER. IN THE JUVENILE COURT HE HAD BEEN PLACED HOME ON PROBATION HE HAD BEEN PLACED IN SUITABLE PLACEMENT. INFECTED BEEN GIVEN TWO SEPARATE COMMITMENTS OF CAMP COMMUNITY PLACEMENT. AND HE HAD BEEN RELEASED LESS THAN THREE WEEKS FROM CAMP ABOUT WHEN HE CAME OUT AND MURDERED A RIVAL GANG MEMBER. INDIA'S RARE SITUATIONS WHERE THE JUVENILE COURT MAY THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO TRANSFER THIS CASE TO CRIMINAL COURT. THE JUVENILE COURT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO PASS A FITNESS HEARINGS IN THEIR COURT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THAT DISCRETION EVEN IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS MINOR SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED. OH BY THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE THE JUVENILE COURT WE BELIEVE IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO KNOW WHO IS AND WHO WAS NOT FIT FOR BEING HANDLED WITHIN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JUVENILE COURT DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THESE IMPORTANT DECISIONS BOTH IN THE INTEREST OF REHABILITATING THE MINOR BUT ALSO IN THE INTEREST OF PROTECTING THE COMMUNITY. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY WERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN PER SHAUN OFTEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN RESPECT WHAT POSITION SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE FOR THE REASONS. STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AND ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT THE THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE IN. SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE I THINK HIS [inaudible] STORY. IS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW THE CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS PROPERLY. HE WAS CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER PRESUMABLY PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN WHEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY FILED. INSTEAD THEY WENT TO A FITNESS HEARING THE JUVENILE COURT DECIDED THIS PERSON IS SOMEONE THAT'S BETTER SERVED IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM AND THEY KEPT IN THERE. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT. ILLUSTRATES ANY SORT OF A OF A PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED -- DIDN'T SO WE WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO TO REJECT THE BILL AND LEAVE THESE DECISIONS IN THE HANDS OF THE JUDGES THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN -- IN A VERY STRONG. SUPPORTERS OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN THE PAST WE WOULD -- SUGGEST THAT THEY THEY CONTINUE THAT TRACK RECORD TODAY AND OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ARE JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE THE ASSOCIATION FOR LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN DJJ WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE THANK YOU BOMB AT AN IRISH RESPECT THAT BUT ONLY DID A LOS ANGELES DJ [inaudible] AND THEIR CONCERNS AND I THINK WHAT THE SENATE IS TRYING TO DO. ISLAM. LOOK AT WHY THESE INDIVIDUALS DID WHAT THEY DID THEM. BUT IT WAS A RED WITHOUT A DOUBT AND NOT EVEN. WE'RE NOT EVEN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. BUT ALSO USED THE THE EXAMPLE. OF A OF A PERSON OFFICE SERVED IN BEEN. SERVE TIME IN THE PENITENTIARY. BECAUSE THEY HAD A POLICE OFFICER IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS HUNGRY HAD NEAT IN A WEEK. TRYING TO GRAB. A BURRITO ARM CAME OVER HE CAME BACK AND HIT SOMEONE IN THE FACE HAPPENED WEEK LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER BROKE HIS NOSE WAS CONSIDERED REALLY EGREGIOUS THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. HE ULTIMATELY ENDED UP AND AND THE PRISON SYSTEM. NO ONE EVER SAT WITH THEM. AND ASK HIM WHAT WAS A PROBLEM INSTEAD THEY JUST ASSUMED. THE THREAT. BECAUSE HE WAS HUNGRY. AND I THINK WHAT TO SENATORS TRY TO GET TO LET'S GET TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM WHICH IS WHAT. WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET TO IT WHICH FOR THREE ABILITY ACTION THAT'S WHY [inaudible] HI I'M. MOVING FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY COMMITTEE MOVE FORWARD WITH THEM. WITH AN AYE RECOMMENDATION THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION [inaudible] VOTE [inaudible] COLUMBO. ON SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO CARILLO [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE AYE KILEY QUIRK [inaudible] SANTIAGO. BILL DON'T CALL LEGUMES TERM EVER SPANK YOU. I BELIEVE MISTER BRADFORD SENATOR SKINNER. BOB HAS GRACIOUSLY. AND THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT THE LONGER. THAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED. THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT OUR KNIGHTS OF NI A WHICH IS SIMPLY REQUIRE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES A POSTER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ONLINE. THE BILL APPLIES TO ONLY PUBLIC RECORDS UNDER CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT -- I AUTHORED A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR A. B. THREE FOUR FIVE WHICH THE GOVERNOR VETOED ANY SAID -- WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE AND OUT APPROACH THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL EXACTLY GUYS. MANY AGENCIES ARE READY LISTS -- THEIR TESTING IN -- TRAINING. ONLINE BECAUSE HE'S TOO SMART AND RIGHT THING TO DO -- IT HELPS -- BILL TRUSTS IN THE COMMUNITY AND HELP SAVE TAXPAYERS MONEY. AND I RESPECT LAST FREE THE AYE VOTE TODAY I HAVE SUSAN LEFT -- EYES WHO'S A MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION HEARING TESTIMONIES THANK THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. SEC. ETCETERA BRADFORD JUST SAID IN OVER TWENTY COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ANOTHER TWENTY OR MORE IN THE WHOLE UNITED STATES THERE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT ARE CHOOSING ON THEIR OWN TO PROVIDE ONLINE PUBLIC RECORDS. TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND THAT ALLOWS US SENATOR BRADFORD SAID BETTER ACCESS TO INFORMATION MORE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT SUPPORT. BETWEEN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST FOR A MOMENT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THIS IN EFFECT? IN COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT YET HAVE ONLINE PLEASE REGULATIONS THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT PROVIDES BIG CHALLENGES. THERE OVER SIX HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. NONE OF THEM USE STANDARDIZED LANGUAGE AND LABELS IN THEIR DESIGNATIONS OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A PUBLIC RECORD AND IN WITHIN THE PUBLIC RECORDS. WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM IS THIS MAY SOUND REALLY TRIVIAL BUT IN REALITY IT CREATES OBSTACLES TO ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE PUBLIC? INDIVIDUALS WHO SEEM THESE WHO SEEK THESE REGULATIONS HAVE NO WAY TO IDENTIFY WHAT DOCUMENT THEY'RE ASKING FOR AND SUBSTANTIVELY. WHAT THE INFORMATION LOOKS LIKE? JUST THIS PAST FRIDAY I HAD TO GO TO COURT TO TRY TO GET A PUBLIC RECORD THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AGREED WAS A PUBLIC RECORD. THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN CPR THIS WITHIN TEN DAYS WITHOUT ANY ARGUMENT. BUT I HAD TO GET A COURT ORDER TO GET A PUBLIC RECORD. IF THIS BILL IS ALREADY IN PLACE I COULD HAVE JUST GONE ONLINE AND DOWNLOAD IT MYSELF BUT INSTEAD I HAD TO HAVE A JUDICIAL OFFICER ORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TURN IT OVER TO ME -- S. B. SIX NINE SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD SAY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE COST OF COMING TO COURT IN DEFENDING THEMSELVES. AND WOULD. CREATE BETTER ACCESSIBILITY ASSIST IN EDUCATING THE PUBLIC HELP PUBLIC AGENCIES TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN BEST PRACTICES AND PROVIDE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY. ALL OF THOSE GOALS WILL MEET THE PRESIDENT OBAMA TAX TASK FORCE ON TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES TO SUPPORT Q.. SO BLACK AMERICAN POLITICAL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL WE THINK THAT IT THAT HE'LL NAME OR I'M SORRY NAME AND ORGANIZATION ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MAKING MORE WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT MAKE YOU. A JURY OF HARRY WHILE WE DON'T HAVE -- OFFICIAL SUPPORT ON THE BILL WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. NOT THAT WE KNOW. THAT BAY PACKERS BACK UNDER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WHICH OF MOURNERS CORSO'S ALONG THE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. OUT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THAT IT IS THE WITNESS POINTED OUT. OSTENSIBLY THE DOCUMENTS AND POLICIES AND STATEMENTS AND PROCEDURES AS THE BILL ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE THEM ARE ALREADY PUBLIC RECORDS. BUT AGAIN BY THE OPERATION OF THE BILL AND IT IT HELPED IT. REFERS ONLY TO DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY DISCLOSED BOWL UNDER THE P. R. A SO THE NET RESULT IS. A CHANGE IN PROCESS ON HOW THESE DOCUMENTS ARE PROCESSED. AND MADE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IF SOMEBODY REQUESTS TO DOCUMENT. THE RECORDS -- SUPERVISOR THE CLERK WHO OVERSEES THESE RECORDS -- FINDS A RECORD SOMEBODY IN THE OPERATION MAKES A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S PUBLIC DOCUMENT. AND THEN IT'S RELEASED OR IT'S NOT BASED ON SECTION SIX TWO FIFTY FOUR IS THEIR INVESTIGATIVE EXEMPTION IS THERE SOME REASON NOT TO DISCLOSE IT. THAT DECISIONS MADE AND THAT'S TURNED OVER IT'S NOT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE PR A THIS BILL EFFECTIVELY SAYS. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL YOUR RECORDS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. AND DETERMINE IN ADVANCE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE INDEED DISCLOSE A BOWL UNDER THE PR A AND THEN AFFIRMATIVELY POST THEM. AND SO YOU CREATING THIS UNFUNDED MANDATE TO PUT THESE RECORDS TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE. IN CIRCUMSTANCES PRESUMABLY WHERE NO ONE HAS ASKED TO SEE THEM -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS FOR THE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL LAST YEAR WERE STILL OPPOSE THIS YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN DEVELOPMENT CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION YOU KNOW WE HAVE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE FIVE SWORN OFFICERS SIX ONE OFFICERS TEN SWORN OFFICERS IS OUR SMALL DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE USUALLY UNDERSTAFFED DUE TO INJURIES OR OTHER REASONS TRAINING ISSUES. AND TO REQUIRE THEM TO PULL SOMEONE OFF THE BE. TO GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT THAT THEY HAVE. THAT WOULD BE DISCLOSED UNDER THIS ACT -- SCANNED THROUGH FIND OUT WHAT'S RELEASABLE WHAT'S NOT AND THEN POSTED ONLINE FOR SOMEONE WHO MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT WANT TO COME AND TAKE A LOOK AT SOME POINT DOWN THE FUTURE. AS AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN TO US. IT ALSO JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE YOUR POINT OFFICERS OFF THE BEAT. TO GO IN AND SPEND TIME DOING THAT AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. LIEUTENANT SHIRLEY SO WILLIAM SALMON AND IN ALL SHARE SOME BEHALF OF SHERIFF MCMAHON RESPECTFULLY AND OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MARLON MARSHALL ON BEHALF OF SHERIFF BILL GORE IN THE SAN DIEGO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NEWMAN YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER BRADFORD AND IF YOU. WANT TO KIND OF ADDRESS. THINK I MISSED YOUR MEMBERS ARM AND I'M. THANK YOU FOR THE WITNESSES WHO OF SPOKEN SUPPORT AND EVEN THOSE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS AMAZED THAT THE DIFFICULTY THAT THEY CREATE. IT'S SIMPLY A MAKING WHAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. AVAILABLE ONLINE -- EVERYTHING THAT WE DO PRETTY MUCH NOW IN SOCIETY AT ITS VIA THE INTERNET AND TO POST INFORMATION ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF NO ONE IS ASKING TO TAKE LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFF ARE OUT OF THE FIELD BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT IF SOMEONE WALKED INTO THE DEPARTMENT. AND HAD PHYSICALLY REQUIRE ARE REQUEST TO THE DOCUMENT IT WOULDN'T BE POLICE OFFICERS PULLING THAT FILE WOULD BE ADMINISTRATIVE. CLERK SO THE USE EXAMPLE THAT YOU'D BE FORBES FORSMAN OFFICERS THE LITERALLY KEYSTROKE THIS AND AS I IT IN THE POLLS MEANT WHEN I DO. RESPECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SMALLER DEPARTMENTS BOAT I END WITH THOSE SMALLER DEPARTMENTS THERE ARE -- MANOWAR CHALLENGES AND NOW PERSONNEL CHALLENGES BUT AGAIN -- WITH COMPUTERS YOU CAN SCAN A DOCUMENT IN A MATTER OF SECONDS AND IT'S ONLINE WE DOWNLOAD TONS OF INFORMATION IN THIS BUILDING EVERYDAY AND IT AND IT WILL WE MAKE IT AVAILABLE SO WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT. THOSE RECORDS THAT INFORMATION THOSE TRAINING PROCEDURES THAT AS WE STATED PLENTY DEPARTMENTS ARE ALREADY VOLUNTARY DON'T. AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S WHAT IT WAS IN THE AGREEMENT TO SEE IF THEY PASSED ME NARROWED AND THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES WE REALLY ARE ELIMINATED STATE AGENCIES. AND REDUCE IT DOWN THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND POST -- TRAINING SO ARE BASED ON THOSE ARE REASONS AND I THINK IT'S A COMMONSENSE MANAGER IT SAVES PUBLIC TIME IT SAVES PUBLIC MONEY AND I THINK WE ALL ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT TRANSPARENCY MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER. AND THIS IS A STRAIGHT FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY ARE MEASURE THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU -- CHAIRS RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE. CALL THE ROLL. S. B. NINE SEVENTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO CARDIO [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I KILEY QUIRK [inaudible] SANTIAGO. THAT BUILT ON CALL THANK YOU MISSED YOUR MEMBERS TO MORE. BEFORE IT SENATORS SKINNER PRESENTS I WANT TO ANNOUNCE ABOUT SENATOR HUESO. ABA HAS PULLED SB. ELEVEN SIXTY ARMED AUTHOR POULTICES ALSO ON VOTE WAS A VOTE ONLY. SENATOR WE'RE HERE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS. I WILL START WITH SB ELEVEN NINETY OKAY. SB ELEVEN NINETY ESTABLISHES THE EUGENICS STERILIZATION COMPENSATION PROGRAM TO COMPENSATE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS STILL ALIVE TODAY WHO WERE FORCIBLY STERILIZED. DO YOU WHILE THEY WERE BEING HELD IN A STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL OUR STATE MENTAL FACILITY -- I MEAN I JUST JUMPED TO MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO ALLOW THEM -- TO SPEAK AS I DESCRIBED WHAT IT DOES [inaudible] GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS I MADE A WHO DONE WITH CALIFORNIA LET THE NUNS FOR REPORT JUSTICE ALSO KNOWN AS TAYLOR J.. SEALER J. WORK STATEWIDE TO EMPOWER LATINOS LET THE NEXUS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES THROUGH COMMUNICATION POLICY ADVOCACY. AND COMMUNITY INFORMED RESEARCH MUCH OF OUR TIME IS SPENT WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO IDENTIFY ISSUES CRITICAL TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF LATINOS AND ENSURING REPORT JUSTICE. CEELO JAY'S MISSION IS TO ACHIEVE THE TENETS OF REPLY JUSTICE INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PARENT. TO THAT AND SB ELEVEN NINETY UPHOLDS OUR CONVICTION THAT EVERY PERSON'S REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY. AND DECISION SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THEMSELVES. PART OF OUR WORK ALSO INCLUDES CONNECTING THE DOTS BETWEEN PEOPLE'S LIVES IN ADVOCACY THROUGH THE USE OF STORY TELLING. AND EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NO STERILIZATION SURVIVORS HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY. I CARRY THEIR STORIES WITH ME. IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD IRISH LOPEZ A MEXICAN AMERICAN WOMEN STARTED WORKING AT THE CAL SHIPYARDS IN LOS ANGELES TO HELP SUPPORT HER FAMILY. HOWEVER BEFORE JOINING THE SHIPYARDS AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN IRIS WAS COMMITTED TO A CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION AND STERILIZE. SIMILARLY IN MARCH OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR FOURTEEN YEAR OLD MEXICAN AMERICAN MARY FLUNG GO WAS COMMITTED TO PACIFIC COLONY ASYLUM A FACILITY SET UP BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HOUSE THE INSANE. SPECIALIST THERE SOON DIAGNOSED HER WITH PEOPLE MY IT IS TIED TO SOCIAL DEVIANTS AND TWO MONTHS LATER HER FOR LOW PAY AND TUBES WERE REMOVED. EIGHT TAKE ITS ON FRANCO'S STORY CONTINUES TO HAUNT HER FAMILY. FOR SEALER DAY IT IS URGENT AND NECESSARY FOR CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE REDRESS TO THE ESTIMATED SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SURVIVORS ALIVE AS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THESE SURVIVORS 62% ARE WOMEN AND 18% ARE LATINOS LATINOS. DEMONSTRATING THAT THEIR WORD GENDER AND RACIAL BIAS SEES IN THE DETERMINATION OF STERILIZATION. LATINO PATIENTS WERE 59% MORE LIKELY TO BE STERILIZED THEN LOT NON LATINO PATIENTS AND LATINO PATIENTS WERE 23% MORE LIKELY TO BE STERILIZED THE NON LATINO PATIENTS. WHILE ALARM MEAN IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THAT LATINOS LATINOS WERE DISPROPORTIONATE TARGETED AND DEEMED UNFIT TO PARENT. RACE AND ETHNICITY IN THE U. S. HAS ALWAYS BEEN INTERTWINED WITH EUGENICS EFFORTS AND OTHER POLICIES OF REPRODUCTIVE OPPRESSION PAST AND PRESENT. YOU CHEN EXPLOSIVE TO THE ONE AS SB ELEVEN NINETY AIMS TO REDRESS ARE ROOTED IN RACES CLASSES A REALIST AND SEXES BELIEVES THAT WOMEN AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE IRRESPONSIBLE REPRODUCE THERE'S BAD PARENTS AND DRAINS ON SOCIETY AT STEREOTYPICAL. DRIVEN LOGIC. OTHER MONETARY COMPENSATION MIGHT NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE HARM SUFFERED BY STERILIZATION SURVIVORS IT CAN BE A FIRST STEP IN CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE IN THIS VIOLENT PAST. I AM ASKING COMMITTEE REFER MEMBERS TO REFLECT ON OUR DICHOTOMOUS HISTORY. WHILE WE AS A STATE PRIDE OURSELVES IN PUSHING FORWARD PROACTIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH POLICIES. ON THE SAME POINT IN OUR STATE OFFICIALLY ACCOUNTED FOR ONE THIRD OF ALL STERILIZATIONS THAT OCCURRED IN THIRTY TWO U. S. STATES IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. SO HOW DO WE VALUE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE WHEN THE HISTORY DIPAK DEPICTS A DIFFERENT STORY. AND WHY HAS IT TAKEN OUR STATE SO LONG FOR SURVIVOR SUCH AS IRIS AND MARY TO BE GIVEN SOME FORM OF JUSTICE. TODAY'S VOTE CAN BE A TURNING OF TIDES IN REGARDS TO THIS HISTORY EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE BEST REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO TRULY EMBODY THE VALUES WE ALREADY WHO CLAIM TO HOLD DEAR IT IS TIME TO REMEDY OUR PAST VIOLATIONS TO THE SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIANS TO STAND AGAINST ABUSIVE REPRODUCTIVE PRACTICES AND TOGETHER IN SUPPORT OF THE LAST WEEK SB ELEVEN NINETY THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KARLY MYERS AND I'M AN ATTORNEY FELLOW WITH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS EDUCATION AND DEFENSE FUNDS AND NATIONAL DISABILITY LAW AND POLICY CENTER THAT PROTECTS IT ADVANCES THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AS AN ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO PROMOTING EQUALITY AND ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB ELEVEN NINETY IN BELIEVE IT WILL PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN ADVANCING DISABILITY JUSTICE. BETWEEN NINETEEN OH NINE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AT LEAST TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE CLASSIFIED AS HAVING DISABILITIES WERE INVOLUNTARILY STERILIZED AT THE HANDS OF THE STATE. BASED ON INACCURATE IN MISGUIDED ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT DISABILITY PEOPLE WERE LABELLED QUOTES MORON IN MISSILE OR MENTALLY DEFECTIVE. IN THEY WERE SUMMARILY STERILIZED. CALIFORNIA'S EUGENICS STERILIZATION LAW WAS ONE OF SEVERAL LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ON THEIR FACE TARGETED PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND IN PRACTICE HAD A DISPARATE IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN IN POOR PEOPLE. THE U. S. SUPREME COURT'S INFIRMITIES DECISION IN BUCK V. BELL PERHAPS BEST SUMMARIZES THE HORRIFIC REASONING BEHIND THE STERILIZATION LAWS. IN THE SHAMEFUL WORDS OF JUSTICE HOLMES IT IS BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD IF INSTEAD OF WAITING TO EXECUTE TO GENERATE OFFSPRING FOR CRIME OR LET THEM STARVE BEFORE THEY'RE IMBECILITY. SOCIETY CAN PREVENT TO THOSE WHO ARE MANIFESTLY UNFIT FROM BREEDING THE KINDS. THREE GENERATIONS OF EMBASSY AISLES ARE ENOUGH. AS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE STERILIZER IN THE COUNTRY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DENOUNCE EUGENICS STERILIZATION LAWS FOR WHAT THEY WERE. A FLAGRANT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. IN RECOGNITION OF THE LASTING HARM IS THAT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS INJURED SB ELEVEN NINETY WILL PROVIDE SURVIVING INDIVIDUALS WITH MONETARY COMPENSATION AND IT WILL RAISE. PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT THE INJUSTICES THAT THEY FACED. THROUGH THESE MATERIAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS SB ELEVEN NINETY RECOGNIZE THE HUMAN RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO CONTROL THE REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY. IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT STEREOTYPES IN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE NEVER LEGITIMATE FACTORS IN EVALUATING WHAT IS MEDICALLY. MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE TREATMENTS. ALL PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY REGARDING THEIR LIVES IN REPRODUCTION. FOR THESE REASONS THE DISABILITY RIGHTS EDUCATION AND DEFENSE FUND RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB ELEVEN NINETY THANK YOU SEC. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES A SUPPORT.

SEE IN NINE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER LACKEY [inaudible] YEAH. THIS IS CLEARLY A WORTHWHILE ISSUE AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL OBVIOUSLY BUT I DID HAVE JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS AS AS IT. RELATES TO FUNDING. WHAT WILL BE THE FUNDING SOURCE AYE AND I NOTICED AT ONE POINT GENERAL FUND WAS REFERRED BUT IT WAS CROSSED OUT? AND AT WHAT LEVEL WE WILL WE BE COMPENSATED VICTIMS. DOES MILEY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD WOULD OVERSEE THE PROGRAM THE WE DO NOT SPECIFY THE DOLLAR AMOUNT PARTLY DUE TO AND IT. NEEDING AN APPROPRIATION ORDER FIGURE THAT OUT THE OTHER STATES THAT WE'VE PATTERN THE BILL AFTER. HAVE -- DID THE USUAL SOME IT'S BEEN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER -- PER VICTIM SO THAT IS THE AMOUNT WE'RE THINKING WOULD BE PER HOUR IT WOULD BE -- APPROPRIATE AND IT THAT AMOUNT IF THERE WERE FOR EXAMPLE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT CLAIMS THE TOTAL COST FOR COMPENSATION BE SLIGHTLY LESS THAN FOUR MILLION WHILE OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT THERE'S BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. WHO WERE ALIVE TODAY THAT? GROUP BIG EXPERIENCE THIS -- STERILIZATION AND IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. TO TO IF THE BILL SUCCEEDS GIVEN THE ADVANCED STAGE OF MOST OF THEM. WHILE EUGENICS STERILIZATIONS DID CONTINUE INTO SIXTIES AND SUCH. THE THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE MUCH FROM THE MORE IN THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES. SO GIVEN THE ADVANCED AGE AND THE WE DID NOT PUT. AND OVER AMOUNT OF ONUS ON IT WOULD BE MORE APT TO ADVOCACY GROUPS -- TO TO TRIED IT TO ASSIST THE VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD SO THAT'S WHY WE ESTIMATE THAT WOULD BE A RELATIVELY LOW NUMBER THAT DID COME FORWARD. SO OUR COST ESTIMATE IS BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE MILLION THANK YOU [inaudible] WITHOUT. DO YOU HAVE A IF YOU'RE MICHAEL. I WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD BILL THAT BEGINS TO WRITE SOME SYSTEMIC REPRODUCTIVE WRONGS. WHILE THAT MAY NOT HAVE STARTED WITH BUT CERTAINLY -- INTENSIFIED EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING WITH FOLKS LIKE MARGARET SANGER SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND SPEAKING UP FOR WOMEN THANK YOU. A NEW MAKE CLOTHES I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. RIGHT IN CHAIRS RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE I TO ONE OF THE THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS THERE. TO THERE ARE LOT OF WRONG SAID HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST. A MEASURE AFTER AMERICAN THE NOSE APPROACH TO SKI EXPERIMENT AND FOR DECADES -- DOCTORS WERE EXPERIMENTING. WITH SYPHILIS INJECTED IT INTO AFTER AMERICANS EVEN AFTER THEY DISCOVERED A CURE THEY STILL WERE. DOING EXPERIMENTS ON AFTER UP UNTIL NINETEEN SEVENTY WITH ASSN RECORDS UP UNTIL THEN SO. IT IS WE NEED TO TO ADDRESS WHAT WE DO. AND AS A COUNTRY WHEN WE DO MAKE MISTAKES. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD UP TO DOES NOT OWN UP TO IT AND ALSO -- MAKE REPARATIONS SELECT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. CALLED CALDERON SB ELEVEN NINETY THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY AYE CARILLO. KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE AYE KILEY QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO [inaudible] BILLS OUT. THANKS SO MUCH YOU SO NOW I'LL GO TO S. B. [inaudible] FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND MOVE. SO. WHAT S. B.? FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DOES. IS ADDRESSED THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA'S MURDER STATUTE. HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED. FOR DECADES AND WHEN IT WAS ADOPTED. IT SWEPT UP. THE ENGLISH COMMON LAW CONCEPT OF FELONY MURDER WHICH IS. AS I INDICATED IN A A COMMON LAW CONCEPT THAT IS MORE THAN A CENTURY OLD. WHICH BASICALLY -- IT IS NOT SO MUCH. HOLDS. A BE A CULPABILITY. IS OF A OF THE PERSON THAT QUESTION IS LESS A FACTOR. IN THE CHARGE FOR THE CRIME AND INSTEAD WHAT IT IS ANYTIME A CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED WHERE DEATH OCCURS. THE FELONY MURDER RULE SWEEPS ACT. THAT THE ANY PARTICIPANT IN THAT CRIME. NOW WHAT THAT IN ITS PRACTICAL EFFECT HAS RESULTED IN IS THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE SERVING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE SENTENCES WHO WERE CONVICTED UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE. WHO WERE NEITHER AWARE THAT A MURDER OCCURRED? PLANTS THE MURDER OR COMMITTED THE MURDER. AND WHILE WE STILL HAVE ON THE BOOKS SUCH LAWS AS ACCESSORY TO MURDER AN ACCOMPLICE TO MURDER WE HAVE THE ABILITY THROUGH EXISTING STATUTES. TO CAPTURE THOSE A WHAT WE MIGHT CALL PARTICIPANTS IN A CRIME. AND DEAL WITH THEIR LESS CULPABILITY THAT DOES NOT HAVE. TO A APPLY FILL ANY MURDER RULE TO THOSE WHO HAD A VERY MINIMAL IF ALMOST A NONEXISTENT ROLE IN THE CRIME -- SO -- THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS TEMPTED TO DO IS NARROW THAT STATUTE. AND NARROW IT IN A WAY THAT PATTERNS AFTER THE STATE OF OHIO THE STATE OF KENTUCKY AND A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES. WHO SIMILARLY DID THIS AFTER COURT CASES WITHIN THEIR STATE AND WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR OWN -- SUPREME COURT OR SUPERIOR COURT HAS DESCRIBED THE APPLICATION OF CALIFORNIA'S FELONY MURDER RULE AS BARBARIC. BUT HAS NO I CHANGE THE SENTENCES AND IS INDICATED THAT IT IS THE DOMAIN OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. SO THAT IS WHY BRING THE BILL TO IT BEFORE YOU TODAY IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. AND I WOULD LIKE ME WITNESSES NOW -- TO SPEAK IN. WITNESSES AND SPORTS TESTIFY THANK YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES APIECE. NOT EACH BUT FIVE MINUTES IN TOTAL UPS ARE [inaudible] THE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS JOCK WHO WILL SEND. AND THIS IS MY FATHER MAC WILSON. I HE'S A RETIRED AIRFORCE SERGEANT SERVED TWO TOURS OF DUTY IN VIETNAM WITH DISTINCTION. HE IS MY HERO HE IS MY INSPIRATION. THE REASON THAT WE ARE HERE IS BECAUSE MY YOUNGER BROTHER. IS CHARGED WITH FELONY MURDER. IN THIS IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH HE DID NOT KILL ANYONE. ATTEMPT TO KILL ANYONE OR INTEND TO KILL ANYONE. HE WASN'T EVEN PRESENT AT THE SCENE. HOWEVER UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE. NONE OF THAT MATTERS. AND TO BE CLEAR. S. B.. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DOES NOT ABOLISH THE FELONY MURDER RULE. IT MERELY LIMITS ITS APPLICATION. MY FAMILY IS NOT THE ONLY FAMILY WHICH HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY THIS ANTIQUATED PRACTICE. THE FELONY MURDER RULE. HAS TAKEN THE HEAVIEST TOLL ON YOUNG PEOPLE. WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS TOLL CAN ONLY BE MEASURED AND HEARTBREAK. MY EIGHTY THREE YEAR OLD FATHERS LAST WISH. THIS TO BE ABLE TO HUG YOUR SON AGAIN. MY TWELVE YEAR OLD NIECE. I ONLY WISH IS TO BE REUNITED WITH HER FATHER. IT COST OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO INCARCERATED PERSON. THIS BILL WOULD SAVE TAXPAYERS MILLIONS [inaudible] FURTHER. EFFECTIVE LAWYERS LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED. WHEN LITIGATING ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY FELONY MURDER CASES? THAT MEANS THAT CASES ARE IN THE TRIAL COURT FOR YEARS PRIOR TO TRIAL. THIS CAN COST THE COURT AND COUNTIES. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER DEFENDANT. THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT MURDERERS DESPITE THEIR LABEL. THEY ARE OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS BROTHERS SISTERS. FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CALLED THE FELONY MURDER RULE BARBARIC. IN ASK THIS LEGISLATURE. TO FIX IT. YOU ALL HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THAT CHANGE. WE ASK THAT YOU. MAKE THAT CHANGE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THE MORNING MY NAME IS KATE CHATFIELD AND I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF RESTORE JUSTICE. S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN IS A RULE OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY. IF IS A BEDROCK PRINCIPLE OF THE LAW AND A FAIRNESS. THAT A PERSON SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HIS OR HER ACTIONS. ACCORDING TO HIS OR HER OWN LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY. AND NOT FOR THE ACTIONS OF ANOTHER. LIFE SENTENCES FOR NON PERPETRATORS OF THE FATAL ACT NOT ONLY FAILS TO PLACE BLAME WHERE IT BELONGS. BUT IT ALSO APPROACHES CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ALLOWS FOR AN INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT. OF THE PARTICIPANTS CULPABILITY. SOMETHING THAT IS DONE THROUGH OUT OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WITH THE FELONY MURDER RULE BEING ONE GLARING EXCEPTION. THE AVERAGE AGE OF A PERSON CONVICTED. UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE AS A NON PERPETRATOR IS TWENTY YEARS OLD. PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH CITED BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. DEMONSTRATES THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO COGNITIVELY DEVELOP INTO THEIR MID TWENTIES. BEFORE THAT TIME YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED THE DECISION MAKING SKILLS TO REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM DANGEROUS SITUATIONS PARTICULARLY WHEN OLDER PEERS ARE INVOLVED MOREOVER. STUDIES REVEALED THAT 72% OF WOMEN INCARCERATED IN CALIFORNIA WITH A LIFE SENTENCE UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE WERE NOT THE PERPETRATORS OF THE HOMICIDE. THEY WERE ACCOMPLICES IN THE UNDERLYING CRIME ONLY. S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WOULD ALSO ALLOW RE SENTENCING FOR PEOPLE WHO DID NOT KILL OR INTENT TO KILL. INSTEAD. THESE INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS WOULD BE SENTENCED FOR THE CRIMES THEY DID COMMIT. AND WOULD NO LONGER SERVE LIFE SENTENCES FOR CRIMES THEY DID NOT COMMIT. AS OUTLINED IN THIS COMMITTEES ANALYSIS RESEARCH REVEALS THERE'S NO DETERRENT EFFECT THE FELONY MURDER RULE. S.. IN THE ANALYSIS. IF THE PRIMARY RATIONALE FOR A STATE TO RETAIN THE FELONY MURDER RULE IS TO REDUCE CRIME. THE STATE SHOULD RECONSIDER THIS RULE. PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUST CRIMINAL LAWS ARE NOT A ZERO SUM GAME. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN STILL PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. AND HAVE A JUST AND EQUITABLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON SP FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN TODAY THANK YOU.

CITY WHATEVER -- PIECE OF IMPORTED CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] I STILL MORNING GOOD MORNING. CRACK MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SHAUNA HOFFMAN. THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION OF IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO S. B.. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN CDA IS. OPEN TO THE IDEA OF REVISITING THE APPLICATION OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE -- TO AND WE'VE SUPPORTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER'S BILL EARLIER THIS YEAR WE'VE ALSO HAD VERY -- I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT AS VERY POSITIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH. THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS -- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. HOWEVER AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED SP FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WE BELIEVE IS FLAWED IN INTO VERY SIGNIFICANT WAYS. FIRST. THE BILL ELIMINATES ANY ADDITIONAL LIABILITY THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SOMEBODY LOST THEIR LIFE. IN THE COMMISSION OF THE UNDERLYING FELONY -- THESE ARE CRIMES THAT HAVE VICTIMS WHO DESERVE SOME MEASURE OF FINALITY AT SENTENCING. AND SO TO TWO RECENT SOMEONE TO SIMPLY THE SENTENCE FOR THE UNDERLYING FELONY. WE BELIEVE -- DOES NOT APPROPRIATELY KNOWLEDGE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT THAT. OCCURRED I IN THAT INCIDENT. SECOND AND IN THIS GETS A LITTLE MORE TECHNICAL ON THE RE SENTENCING ASPECT OF IT BUT THE BILL'S FULLY RETROACTIVE AND APPLIES CURRENTLY TWO CONVICTIONS OBTAINED BY PLEA. PLACING A BURDEN ON THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE INELIGIBILITY FOR RELIEF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. IN CERTAIN CASES THIS WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE -- WHEN THERE'S A PLEA THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT? WE DON'T DO IT WHEN THE INVESTIGATION AT THAT POINT. FOR FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES IT STOPS [inaudible] AND SO. IT FOR NOW IN EFFECT ASKING US TO GO BACK AND RE TRY THE CASE ON THE ISSUE OF ELIGIBILITY. I YEARS OR DECADES LATER PERHAPS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF WITNESSES AND WITHOUT EVEN COMPLETE INVESTIGATIVE FILE AND HAVING TO PROVE. INELIGIBILITY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT'S A BURDEN THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO MEET WHICH WILL RESULT IN PEOPLE WHO. MAY NOT BE -- THE THE INTENDED TARGET OF THIS RELIEF. HAVING THAT RELIEF EXTEND TO THEM WHICH WE BELIEVE MAKES THE COMMUNITY UNSAFE WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPONSORS OF THE AUTHOR -- AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE -- EVERYBODY'S COMFORTABLE BUT I AS THE BILL'S DRAFTED TODAY WE ARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST ON KEPT KEY WAS MCCUE CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE HON OF THE DA'S. ARE REGARDING THE CONCERNS IT'S JUST FROM A VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE I WOULD JUST TO KNOW CONCERNS RELATIVE. TO AYE THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE A VICTIM -- WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE CASE HAD BEEN RESOLVED BEHIND THAT ON JUSTICE ARE FOR THE VICTIM HAD BEEN SERVED BUT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE PULLED BACK. ON INTO A SITUATION WHERE THERE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS JUST ABOUT PROCESS ABOUT VICTIM INVOLVEMENT IN ENGAGEMENT -- AND HOW THAT WOULD PLAY OUT IN TERMS OF THOSE ON RIGHTS AFFORDED TO VICTIMS UNDER MARCY'S LAW ON STATE LAWSUIT WITHOUT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR WE'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH HER SPONSORS. ABOUT US SOME POTENTIAL BUT ON DISCUSSIONS AND AMENDMENTS AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE OF THE DIALOGUE THAT'S FAR AND FORWARD BONTA THE CONTINUE CONVERSATION HOPEFULLY REMOVE IN OPPOSITION AT SOME POINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YES SIDE JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WE CALIFORNIA NARCOTICS OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFF'S THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE. AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY PROFESSIONAL POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE PRIOR WITNESSES ARE OPPOSITION. IS ROOTED IN THE BILL AS CURRENTLY CRAFTED. BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING DISCUSSION. AMONG THE PARTIES -- AS OF THE PREVIOUS WITNESSES HAVE SAID WE ARE NOT OPPOSED PER SE TO REFORM OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE. BUT WE DO HAVE ISSUES -- WITH THE WAY THE BILL IS CURRENTLY CRAFTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] YES. CORSO'S ALONG THE HAVE A CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION FOR THE REASONS STATED IN OPPOSITION. TOMAR TOKAT DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT FORM FORM OF THE BILL THANK YOU. MAKE. CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN THE FILMING CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND NOW TURNED OVER TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS A BILL. MOVE THE BELL SECOND SO. OKAY SO I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF PHAM. THE GENTLEMAN HERE MADE SOME -- OFFERED SOME VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS IF YOU WOULD CARE TO RESPOND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID WAS -- TO RECENT ON THE UNDERLYING FELONY DOESN'T REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE OTHER VICTIMS SO MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO KIND OF RESPOND TO THAT. THANK YOU I WILL I WILL I AM DO SO APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THAT. I WANT TO PREFACE IT WITH THE FACT THAT [inaudible] WHAT -- I WILL DESCRIBE THE AMENDMENTS WE HAVE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS BUT I WANNA PREFACE IT WITH [inaudible] THAT WHILE. REGARDLESS OF HOW WE AMEND THIS BILL. THE FACT REMAINS THAT THERE ARE. PEOPLE WHO. HAD THE SAME ROLE. IN THE COMMISSION OF A FELONY WERE A DEATH OCCURRED WHO ARE NOT SENTENCED UNDER FELONY MURDER. AND THEN THERE A GREAT DEAL WHO ARE. SO WE HAVE ALREADY IN EXTREMELY UNEQUAL CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE LIVE LAW WAS NOT APPLIED TO ALL. SO IN OTHER WORDS EVERYONE. WHO IF WE IF WE HAD OUR WITNESS AT THE TABLE WHO DESCRIBES HIS SON CIRCUMSTANCE? WE COULD EVERY SIMILAR PERSON. WHO DID NOT GET CHARGED THAT WAY AS HIS SON DID? AND WE HAVE -- THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DATA TO THAT EFFECT -- SO OF COURSE IN WHAT UNFORTUNATELY OCCUR SO OFTEN. IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS YOUR IN ADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION. BECAUSE EITHER DUE TO POVERTY OR OTHER REASONS. AND THEN YOU MIGHT DO A PLEA BARGAIN. IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE ANOTHER PERSON WITH BETTER REPRESENTATION DID NOT AND YET YOUR ROLE IN THE PARTICULAR CRIME WAS EQUAL. SO I JUST WANTED TO FIRST PUT THAT IN THE RECORD NOW WE HAVE BEEN MEETING. FROM THE DAY I INTRODUCED EVEN PRIOR TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BILL WITH THE DA'S AND WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ORDER TO TRY TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE HAVE. A REFORM TO CALIFORNIA'S FELONY MURDER RULE THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. AND WE'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. THAT OH ON THE SUGGESTION OF THE DA'S INCLUDING WE CLARIFIED THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE MASTERMIND BEHIND A CRIME SO JUST AS AGAIN -- CLARIFICATION [inaudible] IF. ALREADY UNDER THE WAY THE LAWS THE BILL AS WRITTEN IF YOU -- PLANNED THE MURDER IF YOU -- PAID SOMEONE FOR THAT MURDER IF IT DIDN'T VARIETY OF OTHER VERY SPECIFIC ROLES IN IT THAT ART CHEST THE ACTUAL MURDERER. YOU WOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM THIS CHANGE BUT WE ALSO CLARIFIED THAT PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE MASTERMIND. MASTERMIND WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THIS BILL AND COULD STILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE. WE ALSO -- CLARIFIED THAT PEOPLE WHO EIGHT COVERED IN THIS BILL AND THEY ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR RE SENTENCING. AND FINALLY WE FLIPPED THE BURDEN OF PROOF SO THE PROSECUTION NO LONGER HAS TO PROVE. IN THE RECENT SING PROCESS BUT RATHER THE PETITIONER MUST PROVE THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF AND THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED CONCERNS. OF THE DA'S ASSOCIATION BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL BILL PLACE THEBURDEN ON THE DA'S SHOW THAT THE PETITIONER WAS INELIGIBLE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. SO WE ARE STILL IN CONVERSATION. TO SEE WHAT MIGHT A ADDITIONALLY ADDRESS CONCERNS BUT I THINK THE DA'S OF REP WOULD DESCRIBE THAT WE HAVE BEEN. IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION AND HAVE TAKEN AND I'D NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO DATE. AND FOR THE RECORD YOU IT'S NOT GIVING FOLKS A FREE PASS YOU STILL HAVE NOT ADDITION S. RECENT IN THING RIGHT CORRECT. CORRECT IMPROVE THE YES AND YOU STILL MAINTAIN A STRIKE CORRECT. ON YOUR REFERENCE YES. SO IT'S NOT WERE BEING INTENTIONAL. WITH IRAQ TALK ABOUT BEING TOUGH ON CRIME ARE SOFT ON CRIME YOU COULD SAY THIS IS ABOUT BEING INTENTIONAL. RIGHT THIS IS THIS IS ALIGNING. THE CHARGE AND THE SENTENCE WITH YOUR ROLE IN THE CRIME SO YOU AS YOU OF ACCURATELY POINTED OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YOU WOULD STILL BE A THAT WOULD BE. YOUR UNDERLYING CRIME WOULD STILL BE A STRIKE UNDER THE THREE STRIKES LAW. BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE IF YOU IF YOU MET THE CONDITIONS OUTLINED IN THE BILL. YOU WOULD JUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE RE SENTENCED FOR YOUR ROLE IN THAT CRIME [inaudible] YOU. OKAY MCKINNEY ANY OF KILEY. A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION THE AND WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS THAT DETERRENCE VALUE OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE EITHER ITS CURRENT VERSION OR WHATEVER REFORM VERSION YOU'D BE. COMFORTABLE WITH. WE THINK THE VALUE OF WHAT IS THE VALUE HAVING ANY FELONY MURDER. RULE ON THE BOOKS PLATED DETERRENCE VALUE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE DISSUADED FROM PARTICIPATING AND SERIOUS [inaudible] DANGERUS FELONIES. BECAUSE IF SOMEONE. DIES IN THE COMMISSION OF THAT FELONY AS THE LAW IS TODAY. ANYBODY INVOLVED IN THAT. COULD CONCEIVABLY -- RECEIVE FIRSTLY MURDER CHARGE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MR QUIRK -- THIS ISABEL THAT'S A LONG TIME COMING AND IT'S VERY FAIR. ARE WE ACTUALLY HAVE CASES WHERE THE SHOOTER IS OUT ON THE STREET BECAUSE HE OUR WAS WILLING -- TO GIVE EVIDENCE. WHEREAS THE PERSON IN THE CAR WHO HAD NO IDEA THAT -- MURDER WAS BEING COMMITTED IS STILL IN JAIL -- I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BILL WHICH RESTORES FAIRNESS TO OUR SYSTEM THANK YOU. BUT MISS COME LABOR DOVE. TARRANT THAT IT -- YOU PEOPLE THINK TWICE. AND I WAS JUST WONDERING. IF ANYONE AT THE DAY AT THE TABLE CAN SHARE YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD OF CRIMINALS WHO HAVE SAID. YOU KNOW. I WAS GONNA DO THIS BUT THEN I THOUGHT I IS GOING TO BE A SIX EIGHTY SEVEN ALL THIS IS GOING TO BE A ONE EIGHTY SEVEN I MEAN HAVE I HAD BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE MY HUSBAND AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY IN. IT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY IN RARE. THAT IN HEARING STORIES PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT THE PENAL CODE THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO THEM IF THEY'RE DOING AN ACT SO BUT MAYBE I DON'T HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION. CAN YOU SHARE IF THAT HAPPENS I GILLOOLY WELL I CAN GIVE YOU ONE FIRST HAND EXAMPLE. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THIS BUT TO MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY WERE MURDERED IN WHAT IS STILL TODAY THE WORST MASS MURDER. IN THE HISTORY OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES LITTLE BAR ON NORMANDY JUST SOUTH OF SLAWSON WAS FIRE BOMBED -- THE GUY WHO DROVE THE GETAWAY CAR MANUEL HERNANDEZ -- AT THE TRIAL LOW IN HIS DEFENSE LAWYER ARGUED AT THE TRIAL -- THAT -- GEE ALL HE DID WAS BUY THE BUCKET A GASOLINE THAT WAS THROWN INTO THE BAR TO BURN SIX PEOPLE TO DEATH -- BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS THE INTENT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE. AND HAD HE KNOWN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIABLE HE WOULDN'T OF BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS AT ALL HE MADE THAT SAME ARGUMENT WHEN HE WAS ULTIMATELY PAROLED -- AND THAT WAS -- THAT THAT WAS A CONSTANT -- REFRAIN -- FROM HIM -- BUT NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT INCLUDING GILBERT COULD SALAS AND JOSE MY DOOR AND I IN OUR FAMILY WERE MURDERED. JUST TO CLARIFY THIS BILL WOULD NOT HAVE -- WOULD NOT ALLOW RE SENTENCING FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT AND GIVE ANY RELIEF TO THOSE WHO AIDED AND ABETTED. THE KILLING WHICH OCCURRED IN THIS CASE SO. IT'S NOT BE APPROPRIATE AS I AM SURE THERE ARE -- EXAMPLES THAT COULD BE PROVIDED THAT WOULD -- MAKE US SOME OF US UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THAT ONE DOES NOT FIT FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL -- I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO SPEAK TO THE DETERRENCE IF I MAY. CHAIR -- REGARDING THE DETERRENCE ISSUE. RESEARCH INDICATES THAT FEWER THAN HALF A PERCENT. OF INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED FOR FIRST OR SECOND DEGREE MURDER. WERE EVEN AWARE THAT THE FELONY MURDER RULE AS SUPPLIED EXISTED BEFORE THEY COMMITTED THEIR CRIMES. SO IF ONE IS NOT AWARE OF SUCH A RULE. AND ITS EXTREME CONSEQUENCES. THEN HOW CAN IT SERVE AS A DETERRENCE. AND I THINK IF WE WERE TO DO A SURVEY. OF THOSE MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE WHO ARE NOT LAWYERS MOST OF THEM WOULD NOT EVEN OCCURRED THAT. IT BECAUSE WE HAVE ON THIS ON THE BOOKS -- THINKS LIKE ACCESSORY ACCOMPLISH VARIOUS OTHER STATUTES I THINK MOST OF US ASSUME THAT. IF YOU YOU KNOW HAD THIS MORE -- PERIPHERAL ROLE IN A MURDER THAT YOU WOULD BE CHARGED WITH THAT THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE CHARGED WITH FELONY MURDER AND FOR EXAMPLE I AM NOT A LAWYER AND UNTIL. I STARTED BE -- WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION AS CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY THE EXISTENCE OF THE WAY CALIFORNIA'S MURDER STATUTE IS APPLIED I WAS NOT EVEN AWARE. THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE. SERVING LIFE SENTENCES IN CALIFORNIA DIRT DUE TO THIS ROLE. ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION I TOO WANTED TO SAY THAT I THINK THIS IS A A GOOD BILL AND AS WE RE CALIBRATE. HOW WIDE AN INCONSISTENT NET THAT WE HAVE CAST AS IT RELATES TO OUTLAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM THIS IS A SOLID STEP? YES DID YOU. SO I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION AND MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATION AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK ALL THE WITNESSES THE CAME FORWARD I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT EASY. TO COME TO THIS BUILDING -- IT IS A LITTLE INTIMIDATING AND THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH TIME TO HEAR FROM ANY BUT FROM EVERYBODY. ESPECIALLY THE PERSONAL STORIES THAT ARE SO DEEP. AND ENTRENCHED IN FAMILY WHO AND CLEARLY IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. FOR COMING TO THIS BUILDING FOR SHARING WHAT YOU CAN HARE AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY OF US THAT ONE OF OVER STATE FORWARD THINKING. AND YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU -- I THINK WE'VE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION IN THE JUST TO CLARIFY FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DOES NOT ABOLISH THE FELONY MURDER RULE. IT RETAINS THE LIABILITY OF FELONY MURDER FOR ANYONE WHO. COMMITTED THE MURDER PLANNED AIDED THE KILLING ACTED WITH RECKLESSNESS DURING THE CRIME MASTERMINDED THE CRIME IN A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER -- CONDITIONS BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS NARROW THE APPLICATION SO THAT IT MORE REFLECTS THE PERSON'S ROLE IN THE CRIME. AND AS I INDICATED IN -- SPONSORING OUR DISCUSSIONI HAVE TAKEN THE NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT WE WORKED OUT WITH THE DA'S. I WILL CONTINUE. TO OUR IT CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE DA'S BECAUSE IT IS MY HOPE. THAT THIS BILL COULD BE IN A FINAL PLACE WHERE THEY COULD BE AT LEAST NEUTRAL -- AGAIN THESE THINGS -- ART BUT NOTHING IS EVER GUARANTEED IN LIFE BUT THAT IS I THINK THAT THE THE ASSOCIATION WOULD -- TESTIFY TWO OUR GOOD CONVERSATIONS IN MY INTENT TO TRY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS -- BUT WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIGHT VOTE. THANK YOU IN THE CHURCH RECOMMEND YA REALLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU'VE HAD RESPECTFUL. HONEST OPEN -- DISCUSSIONS ON THIS MATTER IF TAKING SOME AMENDMENTS AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS SO TO INSURE THAT WE DON'T LET. PEOPLE OUT WHO REALLY ARE CULPABLE LIABLE. AND GUILTY THAT WE'RE NOT GIVING THEM A FREE PASS. SO WITH THAT I'M RECOMMENDING THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT DO AN AYE VOTE. S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. DANCER AYE LACKEY [inaudible] CARILLO. CARILLO AYE KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMAGER-DOVE AYE KILEY. KILEY NO QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THE MEASURE PASSED [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND YOUR LAST ITEM [inaudible] FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE THANK YOU I'M CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS SP -- FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA IS RELATIVELY UNIQUE AMONG STATES. IN THAT WE HAVE -- BASICALLY. THE NEITHER THE PUBLIC NOR EVEN SOMETIMES HIRING AGENCIES HAVE ACCESS [inaudible] TWO RECORDS. AROUND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS -- IT WHEN I SAY WE ARE RELATIVELY UNIQUE THERE'S A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES -- THEIR STATUTES THAT WE PUT INTO EFFECT BUT ALSO THERE WAS A COURT CASE. THAT INTERPRET ARE STATUTES IN A CERTAIN WAY OR AT LEAST SAID UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE CLARIFIES THOSE STATUTES THAT BASICALLY. THERE WOULD BE A FREEZE ON THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO ANY RECORDS RELATED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT CONDUCT. NOW WHAT FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE DOES IS THIS NOT OPEN UP. ALL RECORDS RELATED LAW ENFORCEMENT INEQUIVALENT WAY THAT WE HAVE OUR PUBLIC RECORDS ACT TOWARDS OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RATHER IT'S A NARROW. IT NARROWLY ADDRESSES ONLY. GIVING ACCESS TO THOSE RECORDS RELATED INVESTIGATION RECORDS RELATED [inaudible] TO LAW ENFORCEMENT'S USE OF DEADLY FORCE. BONTA JOB SEXUAL ASSAULT OR ON THE JOB RELATED DISHONESTY. NOW I AM TAKING AMENDMENTS AUTHOR AMENDMENTS WILL FIX LEDGE COUNCIL ERRORS -- BUT ALSO ADDRESS LANGUAGE REALLY -- TOO TIGHT KNIT REGARDING THE ON THE JOB RELATED DISHONESTLY AND FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE ARE -- IN APPROPRIATIONS GOING TO CLARIFY THAT THE RECORDS ON FRIVOLOUS ALLEGATIONS OF USE OF FORCE WOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED -- THERE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I'LL PROVIDE YOU ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE BILL BUT I WANT ALLOW MY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT TO SPEAK FIRST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NIKKI MARTHA CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION INTERACTIONS BETWEEN POLICE AND THE PUBLIC ARE SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL AND CAN MEAN A LOSS OF LIFE FOR LIBERTY. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE TODAY WHO WANT TO TELL THEIR STORIES ABOUT THESE INCIDENTS AND THERE ARE JOURNALISTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO WANT TO STE TELL THE STORIES THAT AFFECT THEIR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE CAN'T THE STORIES HAVE GAPING HOLES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS FOR TOO LONG KEPT INFORMATION ABOUT THESE INCIDENTS SECRET. THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID PEOPLE IN AN OPEN SOCIETY DO NOT DEMAND INFALLIBILITY FROM THEIR INSTITUTIONS BUT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ACCEPT WHAT THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM OBSERVING. SAYING TRUST US DOES NOT CREATE PUBLIC TRUST INSTEAD OF PROACTIVELY DISCLOSING INFORMATION ABOUT THE MOST CRITICAL INCIDENTS CALIFORNIA SH LAW SHROUDS THIS INFORMATION IN SECRECY. AND FORCES MOTHERS AND FATHERS TO BECOME JOURNALISTS TO FIGHT JUNK COVER SCRAPS OF INFORMATION TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. AND WHEN CALIFORNIA JOURNALISTS TRY TO FIND THE SAME INFORMATION THEY ARE STYMIED. CALIFORNIA IS AMONG THE MOST SECRET OF STATES REGARDING POLICE RECORDS IT HAS ONLY WORSENED IN THE LAST TWELVE YEARS SINCE THE COPLEY DECISION. SHUT DOWN WHAT LITTLE ACCESS WE DID HAVE TO INFORMATION. TIME IS COME TO CHANGE THIS AND COURTS HAVE SAID IT IS ONLY THIS LEGISLATURE'S POWER TO DO SO THE SYSTEMIC. SECRECY HURTS EVERY INTEREST EVEN THOSE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL WE WILL BETTER UNDERSTAND COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ARBITRATION SYSTEM IF THERE WAS TRANSPARENCY ABOUT OFFICER DISCIPLINE. WE CAN GET RID OF BAD ACTORS BY ENSURING THAT THEY ARE NOT SHUFFLE TO A NEW DEPARTMENT THAT DOESN'T KNOW THEIR HISTORY. AND WHEN POLICE ACT PROPERLY IN USING FORCE WE COULD KNOW THAT. TO THE SHROUD OF SECRECY SERVES NO. ONE WE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS BALANCED THAT IT PROTECTS ALL OF THE DUE PROCESS INTERESTS. AND THAT IT PROTECTS PRIVACY THAT IT PROTECTS OFFICER SAFETY THERE'S FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO THE DEADLINES FOR DISCLOSURE BUT AT SOME POINT THIS INFORMATION MUST BE DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. WE ARE WORKING WITH SHAREHOLDERS HOLDERS ON THEIR ADDITIONAL -- CONCERNS AND WE ARE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE LIKE TO THINK SENATOR SCANNER.

I THINK THE YOU GOT A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES SO. BUT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BE QUICK. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE LITTLE. ONE EIGHT MILLER LITE HAVE MEANT PART IN ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES GO AHEAD. RAINY PARRY WITH THEIR READING ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HARPER TRONG POOR ACT. NOT POSITION -- WHERE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THAT I THINK WE ACTUALLY HAVE A ME IN AMMAN I JUST. VERY QUICKLY ON THE BILL. OUR OPPOSITION HAS NOT BEEN BASED ON THE RELEASE OF THE INFORMATION AND KNEES LIMITED CASES THE BILL OUTLINES. OUR CONCERN HAS BEEN ON THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCESS STATEWIDE IN A UNIFORM SYSTEM STATEWIDE. WE HAVE TWO MAJOR SECTIONS AND WE HAVE. EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE OF EXAMPLE WE'VE BROUGHT IN -- WHERE AN OFFICER MANY TIMES OFTENTIMES SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE UNION LEADERS THE ASSOCIATION? ARM WILL HAVE SOME TYPE OF SITUATION THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN. AND THEY HAVE A SYSTEM SET UP A SYSTEM OR INVESTIGATORY SYSTEM. WHERE AND FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THREE AGENCIES JUST IN THIS GEOGRAPHIC AREA AROUND RIGHT NOW? AND SINCE I SIT NEXT TO CHIEF SOMEONE MENTIONING ABOUT THAT BUT WHERE WHERE THEY LITERALLY HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE IT'S YOU THE CHIEF MAKING A DECISION ON THEIR DESPITE HER FIRING MEMBER THESE ARE CASES WHERE. THESE OFFICERS WILL ABSOLUTELY LOSE THEIR CAREER IT WILL NOT BE PEACE OFFICERS ANY LONGER. AND OR TALK ABOUT THOSE INVESTIGATORY FILES BEING RELEASED -- OR THEY HAVE AN ADVISORY ARBITRATION SYSTEM WHERE THEY GO TO ARBITRATOR IT SIMPLY ADVISORY THE CHIEF LOOKS AT OR THE CITY MANAGER MOST OFTEN. LOOKS ALLEN SAYS YEAH THAT'S GREAT -- YOU'RE STILL FIRED SO IN MIL INTEL THE SYSTEM IS FAIR FOR THE EMPLOYEES STATEWIDE AND THIS IS MORE YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID MORE FOR A LOCAL UNION ISSUE -- UNTIL THE SYSTEM IS MORE FAIR STATEWIDE BECAUSE THE P. PEOPLE GOING TO LOSE THEIR CAREERS. THAT ARE ONLY ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS BILL SHOULD AT LEAST BE FAIR THE SYSTEM THAT THIS BILL SETUP. SHOULD BE AT LEAST BE FAIR TO EMPLOYEES STATE WHY THEY SHOULD BE UNIFORMLY FAIR. SO WE'VE ASKED FOR A COUPLE OF AMENDMENTS IN THAT AREA AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH THE WITH THE SENATOR. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IN THAT AREA [inaudible] THANK YOU. BUT JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFFS. OF P. -- LA POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE -- AND THE LA COUNTY PROFESSIONAL. YEAH XIN IN CALIFORNIA NARCOTICS OFFICERS ASSOCIATION FIRST WE WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MISTER PARRY ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF THE FAULT FINDING ELEMENT. OF OF THE BILL AND WE WOULD BILL REMINDED THIS COMMITTEE THAT. THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED -- RECOGNIZE THAT ISSUE IMPLICITLY IN APPROVING A BILL BY MISTER SANTIAGO LAST YEAR. THAT WOULD HAVE RAISED THE STANDARD OF PROOF IN CERTAIN AREAS TO A CLEAR AND CONVINCING STANDARD -- BUT THE ELEMENT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL. THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL. PROVIDES THAT THE PERSONNEL RECORDS SHALL BE RELEASED IN ANY INSTANCE WHERE A FIREARM IS USED IN ANY INSTANCE WHERE -- BEAR IS A USE OF TASER USE OF SOME KIND OF AN IMPACT DEVICE OR WHERE THERE IS AN INJURY CAUSING -- OR WITH WHERE THERE'S A CIRCUMSTANCE CAUSING SERIOUS INJURY BODILY HARM OR DEATH WHAT IS? DISTURBING TO US ABOUT THIS FIRST ELEMENT. IS IT THERE IS NO PRECONDITION OF A FINDING OF FAULT. IN OTHER WORDS. OUR OFFICER -- SMITH -- MIGHT HAVE USED -- HER TASER. BUT THE AT THERE. THE FINDINGS OF THE AGENCY ARE THAT SHE WAS ENTIRELY WITHIN POLICY ENTIRELY WITHIN LAW. WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT RELEASING THE PERSONNEL RECORDS. OF OFFICERS WHERE THERE IS NO FINDING OF FAULT. HAS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF ACTUALLY UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE AND HERE'S WHY. USE OF FORCE. IS NEVER PRETTY. IN POLICY OR OUTSIDE OF POLICY BUT THE MOMENT YOU RELEASE. OFFICER SMITH'S PERSONNEL RECORDS EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE TOTALLY WITHIN POLICY TOTALLY WITHIN THE LAW. THE MOMENT YOU RELEASE HER PERSONNEL RECORDS YOU CREATE AN INFERENCE THAT SHE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG. AND WE WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS. ABOUT THE RELEASE OF AN OFFICER'S [inaudible] PERSONNEL RECORDS WHERE THERE'S NO FINDING OF FAULT BY THE AGENCY THANK YOU [inaudible] YES BRIEFLY DOT CHAIR MEMBERS JONATHAN FELT OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION I THERE ARE A LOT OF CHIEFS OUT THERE THAT THAT AGREED WITH THE INTENT OF THE MEASURE THAT THERE IS A LEVEL TRANSPARENCY THAT'S NEEDED THEIR CHIEFS IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL THE PUBLIC. YES THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IS THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION THAT WE TOOK WE RESOLVE THE SITUATION -- AND THEIR CHIEF THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT AND THEY'VE BEEN BLASTED FOR FOR NOT BEING OUTSPOKEN AND PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR THE INFORMATION THEY LITERALLY CAN'T. PROVIDED AND I WON'T NAME NAMES -- FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN MY FRIEND FROM THE UNION. SHOW TO ME -- BUT I MEAN THERE AGENCIES WITH IT HAD REALLY BIG FIGHTS IN THE CHIEF IS PAID THE PRICE. AND THAT'S NOT OKAY. SIMILAR TO THE CONCERNS FROM OTHER COLLEAGUE I REALLY. ARE ISSUES WITH THE BILL AS IT STANDS NOW IS FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION FOR OFFICERS THAT HAVE BEEN EXONERATED. OR THAT FIND THE COMPLAINT NOT SUSTAINED SO IN THOSE CASES WHERE THE OFFICERS BEEN PROVEN NOTHING NOTHING WENT WRONG THERE THERE'S NO NO ABILITY TO SHOW THAT THE OFFICER ACTED OUT A POLICY OUT A LAW -- SUPPOSING THAT OFFICERS TO THE PUBLIC IS A CONCERN FOR US BOTH THE SAFETY OF THEIR OFFICER AND AND FOR YOU KNOW THAT EVERYONE INVOLVED. I KNOW THIS IS BEEN COMPLICATED WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK OUT SOME AMENDMENTS WITH THE THE CHAIR. OR THE I'M. USUALLY WRONG WRONG COMMITTEE. AND THE CHAIR IN THE SENATE -- THE AUTHOR AND AND HER SPONSORS UNDERSTAFFED AND WE HAD SOME REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOMETHING GOOD SOME IN TENSE BUT THERE IS A COURT CASE THAT IS LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO JUST OUT RIGHT. EXIT A REDACT THEIR NAMES LONG BEACH CASE MORE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO PROTECT THIS ALTHOUGH THEIR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE RELEASING HERE THIS IS THEIR PERSONNEL FILES THIS IS A LOT OF INFORMATION AND WE'RE NOT CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT WORD RELEASING IN ITS ENTIRETY TO JUST AS A RECORD. RELATED TO THE FINAL WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RECORD SO. SOME CLARITY THERE WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BUT ALSO SOME WAY TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION FOR THE EXONERATED OFFICERS OF THE OFFICERS THAT ARE -- THE COMPLAINTS NOT SUSTAINED IN THOSE CASES AS THEY TOOK A GREAT STEP FORWARD BY COMPLETELY ELIMINATE UNFOUNDED CASES. SO THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL BUT THERE'S STILL SOME THINGS I NEED TO GET TIGHTENED UP BUT AGAIN. FOR ALL THE SITUATIONS THAT WE WOULD WISH WE COULD HAVE COME OUT AND SAID WHAT HAPPENED IN BEEN CLEAR ABOUT IT -- WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND A SWEET SPOT IN THE END SO THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] YES. LOUIS BROWN A BEHALF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER TO CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF COURSE ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITE. LIEUTENANT SHIRLEY SO WILLIAM SALMON AND IN I'LL SHARE SOME BEHALF OF SHERIFF MCMAHON AND OPPOSITION. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE A COMMENT. SELECT GO MITCHELL LACKEY YES I WOULD THANK YOU. YOU KNOW I I I TRULY APPRECIATE. THE OF THE AUTHOR AND THIS LEGISLATURE ONE TO TAKE STEPS TOWARDS IMPROVING POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS BY PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY. AND I'M ENCOURAGED BY YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH. WITH THOSE WHO HAVE CONCERNS AND IT KNOW SOME OF THE ISSUES ARE STILL KIND OF A LITTLE BIT UNRESOLVED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND FAIRNESS TOWARDS IT. OFFICERS WHO HAVE SHOWN NO MISCONDUCT. BUT WE CERTAINLY NEED TO PUSH FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS. A PROCESS THAT ALLOWS. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WHEN THERE IS MISCONDUCT. AND SO FOR THAT REASON I'M NOT QUITE THERE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT BUT I KNOW YOU'RE CONTINUALLY WORKING AND I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO GET. TWO YES BUT TIME AGAINST THE FORKS I KNOW YOU'RE ACTIVELY WORKING IN THAT AREA [inaudible] QUIRK. YA I THINK THIS IS A CRITICAL BILL TO RESTORE -- FAITH IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT -- AND I HOPE YOU'LL ANSWERING YOU CLOSE THE ACT CONCERNS THAT TELL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE -- ARE WE MUST MELT MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND DIE I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET TO A POINT WHERE EVERYONE IS -- CAN RESOLVE THEIR OPPOSITION BUT IN ANY CASE I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL NOW AND ON THE FLOOR. AND LET ME KNOW ANYWAY I CAN HELP THANK YOU. YES WAS KAMLAGER-DOVE AM. I I FIRST WANT TO THANK MISS THAT DE LA ROSA FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I KNOW THAT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO SHARE. I WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DIETS -- BY SAYING THANK YOU. SENATOR SKINNER FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL -- FLORIDA AND IT'S ASSURING TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND LOOK AT AMENDMENTS -- I DID NOTE IN A COUPLE OF INSTANCES AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT -- THE PERSONAL INFORMATION. FAMILY AND OUTSIDE OF THE PERSON'S NAME THE OFFICER'S NAME BUT THE OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION. IS NOT RELEASED -- I THINK I ALSO READ THAT -- THE RECORD SHOULD ALSO NOT BE RELEASED WHEN THE COMPLAINT IS DEEMED UNFOUNDED AND I THINK YOU ALSO MENTIONED AS AN AMENDMENT TO ADD THE WORD FRIVOLOUS IN THERE AS WELL -- AND SO I THOUGHT I WAS BUT IF I'M WRONG PLEASE CORRECT ME LASTLY I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD YOU KNOW PITCHES -- ARE DIFFICULT -- BUT NO PERSON SHOULD BE -- SHOULD HAVE A LEVEL. OF A PROTECTION IN ON IMPEACH ABILITY FROM THE LAW AND I THINK THIS BILL WORKS TOWARDS KEEPING -- CITIZENS AND FELLOW POLICE OFFICERS OUT OF HARM'S WAY SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. YES AND IT. COMMENTS [inaudible] TO LIKE THANK YOU CHAIR AND USUALLY DO VERY BRIEF CLOSED IF YOU DON'T MIND SINCE THIS IS A A COMPLICATED MEASURE. I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS -- BUT FIRST I'LL SAY BROADLY THAT THE THAT UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND SIX CALIFORNIA GAVE BROAD ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS INTO POLICE CONDUCT. SO IT THIS IS NOT LIKE THIS BILL IS SOMEHOW CREATING A NEW STANDARD THAT HAS NEVER BEEN APPLIED. AND IN FACT THIS BILL IS NARROWER SO IT DOES NOT RETURN CALIFORNIA LAW. TO PRE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX LEVELS OF TRANSPARENCY. INSTEAD IT HAS A MORE LIMITED ACCESS THAT OUR INTENT WAS TO STRIKE THE BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY AND PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW -- THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA IS AN OUT LIAR AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWELVE STATES. INCLUDING ALABAMA ARIZONA GEORGIA FLORIDA OHIO IN UTAH THAT HAVE DISCLOSURE LAWS FAR MORE EXTENSIVE THAN WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU. AND THAT THERE ARE FIFTEEN STATES INCLUDING TEXAS OKLAHOMA ARKANSAS TENNESSEE. THAT ALLOW FOR LIMITED DISCLOSURE THAT IS MORE COMPARABLE TO WHAT IS PROPOSED HERE. NOW IN THE SENATE I TOOK A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE OPPOSITION NOTED THAT I'VE BEEN MEETING. WITH [inaudible] THE CHIEFS WITH PORAC WITH CHP WITH SHERIFF'S THE DA'S AND YOU NOTICE THAT THE DA'S DID NOT TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION AND THAT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE TOOK DE A TOOK AMENDMENTS. AND NOW WHEN I DESCRIBE THIS I WAS NOT BOBBY. CLEARLY I WANTED TO REMOVE AS MUCH OPPOSITION AS POSSIBLE. I WAS HOPING THAT IT WOULD REMOVE MORE OPPOSITION THEN THE JUST THE DA'S BUT THIS IS THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE SENATE. THAT DID REMOVE THE DA'S OPPOSITION IT GAVE AGENCIES THE FLEXIBILITY ON THE TIMING OF THE DISCLOSURE IN ORDER TO RESPECT OFFICERS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS -- FILES TO AMENDED THAT IF THE COMPLAINT AS WAS NOTED HERE WAS UNFOUNDED THE RECORDS WOULD NOT BE RELEASED AND I'M TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ADD FRIVOLOUS THERE ALSO SO EITHER UNFOUNDED OR FRIVOLOUS -- ALSO ALREADY AMENDED WAS THAT RECORDS THAT MIGHT AFFECT CRIMINAL DISCOVERY WOULD NOT BE RELEASED SO THOSE OUR AMENDMENTS THAT I'VE TAKEN SO FAR. NOW I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE. POR ACTS EXPRESSION OR CALL IT ALL OF THIS WAS NOT ONLY THEIR EXPRESSION BUT RATHER RANK AND FILE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S. SUPPRESSION OF FEELING THAT UNTIL THERE IS A UNIFORM DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE. ACROSS ALL JURISDICTIONS THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THE RECORDS RELEASED I APPRECIATE THAT AS A FORMER A MEMBER OF UNION MYSELF. THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU MOVE TO A DIFFERENT WORKPLACE YOU WANT THE RULES TO APPLY -- UNIFORMLY BUT FOR US TO MANDATE A UNIFORM PROCESS NUMBER ONE WOULD OF COURSE -- INCUR GREAT STATE COSTS BECAUSE ANY MANDATE OF THAT SORT WOULD. BE BORNE BY THE STATE AND WOULD CAUSE THE EMPLOYERS OF THOSE OFFICERS -- TO OF I SHOULD NOT BE HAPPY IS A MILD. IT WOULD BE A MILD DESCRIPTION -- SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMPOSE THAT. IN IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THAT THE CHIEFS RACED. BY SOME OF THEM MAY BE A LITTLE EASIER TO ADDRESS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONTINUE WELL I'M CONTINUING THE CONVERSATIONS WITH EVERYONE BECAUSE AND I WILL NOTE THAT IN A MOMENT BUT I WAS VERY OPEN. TO HAVING THE OFFICER'S NAME NOT DISCLOSE BECAUSE FROM MY POINT OF VIEW NO I APPRECIATE THAT SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL WOULD NOT BE HAPPY WITH SUCH AN AMENDMENT. BUT MY PURPOSE IS TO CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE TRANSPARENCY TO CREATE THE PUBLIC TRUST THAT IN AGENCY HAS THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED. AND THAT THEY HAVE. FOUND THAT IT WAS EITHER WITHIN THE RULES OR NOT THE RULES BECAUSE YOU UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE NOW WHERE. DEPENDING ON THE COMMUNITY THE PUBLIC FEELS THAT. THERE IS NO REAL INVESTIGATION THAT OFFICERS ARE ALWAYS JUST HELD -- HELD -- THAT THERE. WHAT SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER ABOVE THE LAW ARE THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS EXONERATED? AND THAT THE NINE RELEASE THE INABILITY OF A JURISDICTION TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE RECORDS TO SHOW THAT THEY FULLY INVESTIGATED. IN I MEAN FULLY THEIR WHAT THEIR WHERE -- IT WAS VERY DETAILED. NOW CREATES THAT TRUST AND SO. FOR ME. IF THE AGENCY IT'S NOT SO MUCH KNOWING THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICER BUT RATHER THE TRUST THAT THE AGENCY HAS RULES THAT THEY FOLLOW THOSE RULES. THAT IN AND ALSO THAT IF FOR EXAMPLE IF AYE OBTAINED IF THE BILL WERE -- IF WE HAD THE ABILITY TO GET RECORDS AND I REQUESTED THE RECORDS UNDER THE PUBLIC INFORMATION ACT. AND IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT I WAS ONLY A SINGLE OFFICER I DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT OFFICER'S NAME TO SAY TO THE AGENCY WHY IS IT THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE OFFICER IN YOUR FORCE. THAT IS REPEATED. IN YOUR JURISDICTION THAT IS REPEATED USE OF FORCE OR REPEATED WHATEVER EGGS AND THAT THAT ALONE CREATES THE ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO HOLD THE AGENCY SOMEWHAT ACCOUNTABLE. BUT DUE TO THE LONG BEACH CASE WE ARE NOW CONFRONTING DIFFICULTYWITH BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SOMETHING. AROUND THAT BUT WE ARE STILL IN CONVERSATIONS. TO TRY TO COME TO SOME KIND OF SWEET SPOT -- ALMOST FORGOT MY LAST POINT -- MY FAULT MY CLOSING IS THAT THE REASON I AM SO COMMITTED AND WILL CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE REASON I'M ALSO CARRYING THIS BILL IS THAT I THINK I RESPECT THE PUBLIC'S. RIGHT TO NO I RESPECT THAT THERE IS UNFORTUNATELY MISTRUST AND YET AT THE SAME TIME. WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE USE OF FORCE IS HAS GONE DOWN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT OUR OFFICERS ARE BETTER TRAINED THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEEN. AND THAT EACH AND EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. EVERY TIME THEY WALK OUT THE DOOR IN THE ON THEIR UNIFORM THEY TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE'S. THEIR LIFE SAID RISK AND WE WANT TO RESPECT WHATEVER WE CONSTRUCT [inaudible] TO BOTH. GIVE THAT ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO TO KNOW AND TO FEEL THAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE BEING RESPECTED AND YET RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO HAVE SUCH AN IMPORTANT JOB. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS I KNOW IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT BALANCE IT MAY BE A BALANCE THAT. WE ARE. UNABLE TO ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE BUT AT LEAST WE COULD GOOD CLOSER AND SO THAT IS WHY I AM CURING IT THAT IS WHY I WILL CONDUCT WIFE TAKING AMENDMENT SO FAR WILL TAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED AND I WILL CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS. BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR AND WITH THAT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO CENTERS. SKINNER AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND ACHIEVEMENT DIFFICULT. EVEN MY IN MY SURE APPEAR TIME I CAN. AND HOW DIFFICULT HAS BEEN -- FOR FOR THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS CHAIR -- TO TO DEAL WITH THIS HIMSELF TRY AYE. REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED TO TALK PICTURE TAKEN RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE I'M A UNION MEMBER. TOO AND I WOULD ONE EXPOSE ANY INNOCENT. UNION MEMBERS ONTO ANY UNNECESSARY SCRUTINY BY THIS BUT SAME MISSION. IF SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING WRONG WE NEED TO EXPOSE AT AND WE NEED TO NOT USE OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS [inaudible] PROTECT THEM. AND AND SO WHAT IF IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING YOUR MEMBERS. AND AND MAKING SURE THAT ARM EVERYBODY IS ABOUT. AS HONEST AND JUST OUTLINED. THE THING I LOVE ABOUT THIS IT'S SOMETIMES AS THOUGH SOMEONE TO UNION MEMBERS AND WERE FOR GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME. SOMETIMES IT THE POLICY. OF THE PROCEDURES AND THE TRAINING IS FLAWED. NOT THE INDIVIDUAL. AND YOU KNOW WE WERE GOING TO GET. TWO THE POLICIES AND THE TRAINING UNLESS WE EXPOSE. AND SO I BY. I'D YOU CAN EVEN APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING AT SUPPOSING THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF NOT DEMONIZING EVERYONE THAT'S IN LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT REALLY LOOKING AT HOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE TRAINED BECAUSE THAT MAY BE THE ULTIMATE FLAW. AND AND WE NEED TO EXPOSE THAT AND SHOW IT IN AND HAVE A FULL DISCUSSION. EVEN THE SMALLER BOMB. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE WE ALL NEED THAT TO TALK ABOUT THAT THIS IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT. NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AND THOSE POLICIES THAT THEY HAD BACK THEN SHOULD NOT BE. DONE THROUGHOUT THIS ARE DISH DISPIRITING TIME. AND SO I'M I'M GLAD YOU YOU YOU LOOK AT THE FAIRNESS HONESTY. AND REALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE EXONERATED -- THAT THAT I DID FOR THE PUBLIC. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHY [inaudible] RIGHT. THEY ARE EXONERATED. AND THEN THE MORE MORE THEY HEAR ABOUT Y. -- SOMEONE MAY MAKE SENSE IMAGE SOME OF FOR SOME PEOPLE SPREADSHEET NAM. I RISK A STATEMENTS DEL ROSA IT MAY NEVER MAKE SENSE BUT HOPEFULLY IT OPENS UP SO THAT SHE SHE SHE DOES SOME CLOSURE. THAT OF WHAT HAPPENED -- SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD SO THAT NEVER HAVE AFTER HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE. LIKE MOST DEAL WITH DIVERSITY THAT WE DON'T ANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED HERE TODAY. THAT WE THAT NUMBER GOES DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN -- TO WHERE I AM ABOUT WE UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS COMMUNITY HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. AND THEN WE CAN MOVE ON TO TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITCHES BETTER PROCEDURES BETTER POLICIES BETTER TRAINING AND WE WE JUST NEEDED TO HAVE THAT I'M I'M. I'M RICH I'M READYNOW TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS I'M READY NOW TO EXPOSE ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING. SO THAT WE CAN MOVE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD BEYOND OF US DOING THINGS AND HOPEFULLY. THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. TAKES A GREATER HAND. AND FERRETING OUT AND I'LL SAY THIS [inaudible] I BELIEVE. JUST LIKE IN OUR PROFESSION AS WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS WHAT PERCENT OF US. TO MAKE A MISTAKE THAT WE ALL GET PREGNANT TO SAME BRUSH. BUT ALSO 1% OF HIS CONDITION REALLY HARM AND DAMAGE AND AND AND SO IF 99% OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WORK HARD WORKING HONEST AND BE DOING THEIR JOB -- I REALIZED THAT 1% BECAUSE THEY HAVE A WEAPON BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TASER BECAUSE THEY CAN PHYSICALLY DO HARM TO SOMEONE -- WE WE NEED TO WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND WORK REAL HARD. TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS OF WERE MISBEHAVIOR IS HAPPENING AND SO -- I LIKED SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS I'M. DUTY ASK DICK ABOUT MOVING THIS BILL TO THE NEXT PHASE THEM DISASTER. ABOUT YOUR YOUR INVOLVEMENT BUT MOST MPORTANT THAT YOU WILL NEED TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION SO THAT WE GET THE BEST BILL POSSIBLE [inaudible] BECAUSE ALL THE BILLS THAT HAVE COME ON LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT AS FAR AS TRANSPARENCY IS CONCERNED. THIS DISTRIBUTE GAME CHANGER IF WE DO IT RIGHT. SELECT CHAIRS RECOMMEND AND I VOTE WITH THE CHAIRS PERMISSION IF I MAY JUST I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING THAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT I FORGOT TO ADD WHICH IS THAT. THAT TRANSPARENCY WOULD AS YOU RIGHTFULLY POINTED OUT HOPEFULLY ENABLE THE PUBLIC AND JURISDICTIONS TO IF THERE IS A CONTINUING PROBLEM. I TRIED AND THEN IDENTIFY HOW. TO FROM A POLICY OR PROCEDURE OR PROCEDURAL WAY ADDRESS IT SO THAT WE HAVE LESS OF IT. AND SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IN IT WAS A POINT I INTENDED TO MAKE SO THANK YOU CHAIR.

THANK YOU ORDER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NOT NAMING ORGANIZATION MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRIAN NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ABOUT MICHAEL RIGHTLY AND ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND SPORT. THANK YOU. AND WHAT ELSE. MARGOT GEORGE ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. MIKE ADOPT OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. A WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BEEN BUSY TODAY FELLOW PERMANENT SEAT ON THE OTHER SIDE. CHECK AND MAKE IT STICK. MUCH PREFER MEDICAL FOR BUILDING AND MANY -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RISK OURSELVES EARLIER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION -- REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE AMENDMENTS WE FOR SORT OF VAGUE DISCUSSIONS OF THIS NOTION BUT I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BILL DOES OR DOESN'T DO. I ONLY KNOW WHAT'S IN PRINT RIGHT NOW SOME GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT AYE WE'RE HAPPY TO LOOK AT ANY AMENDMENTS OF THE AUTHOR OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE -- BUT WITHOUT REVIEWING THOSE AND HAVING. I WILL BE ABLE TO WIN BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE SERVE CORNER SYSTEM -- THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY CONTAINS A MAJOR CHECK AND BALANCE -- THAT. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO THE CORNER IS. A DOCTOR ALWAYS DOES THE AUTOPSY. PRACTICE AND IT WAS CODIFIED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE DOCTOR DOES THE AUTOPSY IN DETERMINES CAUSE OF DEATH. THE CORNER IS THE EXAMINER IS THE INVESTIGATOR AND DETERMINES THE MANNER OF DEATH THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE. JOBS THEY'RE DONE BY TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE. AND THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IF THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAD OR DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS THIS SYSTEM CAN WORK THOSE DIFFERENCES OUT. THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. THAT MATTER HAS BEEN REPORTED ON AUDITED. THERE'S BEEN AN ACTION BY THE BOARD AND THEY'VE TAKEN I DON'T MEAN TO STEP ON MY COLLEAGUES TESTIMONY BUT EXISTING LAW ALLOWS COUNTIES. DECIDE TO ABOLISH THEIR OFFICE OF THE CORNER AND CREATE OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY DID MONTHS AGO THAT'S WHAT SANTA CLARA COUNTY DID A COUPLE OF I THINK. WITHIN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OTHER COUNTIES HAVE CONSIDERED THIS THIS IS IN THE REALM IT'S AN EXISTING LAWS GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. TWO FOUR ZERO ONE ZERO THIS AUTHORITY EXISTS. THE CORNER IS NOT A PHYSICIAN THE NOTION THAT THE CORNER DOESN'T HAVE MEDICAL TRAINING IS A NON SEQUITUR THE CORNERS NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE MEDICAL TRAINING THE CORNER IS NOT UNDERTAKING THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE THAT'S THE DOCTOR'S JOB AND THAT'S THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY. AS I MENTIONED NECKS WITNESSES SPEAK TO LOCAL CONTROL -- THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST THAT WILL BE EXACERBATED BY REQUIRING THIS IN THESE COUNTIES. EVEN THE THE THE RESPONSE WILL BE THAT FRANCE A PATHOLOGIST ARE ARE READY REQUIRED BUT IF THEY ARE MANDATED UNDER THIS BILL. TO BE HIRED IN CERTAIN COUNTIES. IT WILL. RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO CONTRACT WITH OTHER COUNTIES THIS IS VERY COMMON SET UP THAT SMALLER COUNTIES WILL CONTRACT. EITHER WITH THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS OR WITH ANOTHER COUNTY WHO HAS A FRIENDS PATHOLOGIST IN HOUSE THIS WILL MAKE THAT MORE DIFFICULT -- I THINK THAT I WILL STOP THERE AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU YET AFTERNOON JESSICA SAVAGE IN THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION JUST ECHO WHAT MR FOR THE LOS THAT COUNTIES CURRENTLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE A MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CAN OPT TO ABOLISH THE AFTER THE CORONER PURSUANT TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE AND CREATE A MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE. COUNTIES THROUGH OUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE EXERCISED DISABILITY. AND CONSIDERED WHAT MODEL SERVE THEIR PEOPLE BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES MOST RECENTLY WE'VE HAD VENTURA SANTA CLARA. AND SAN JOAQUIN AND I THINK SAN WELL IT'S WORKING. A MAJOR ISSUE AROSE THE SAN JOAQUIN BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAD AN AUDIT CONDUCTED. THEY RECEIVE THE AUDIT RESULTS. BASED ON THOSE AUDIT RESULTS THEY'VE CREATED A MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE. SO I'M OUR POSITION LIKE I SAID FACE PRIMARILY A LOCAL CONTROL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS AND WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. TO THE RIVER TO GET. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS POLIO HER SHUDDERING THREE ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD SUPRISED SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY IN KERN COUNTY. LINKED TO LEAD WITNESSES REALLY NAILED IT A SEVENTEEN IS ALREADY DOING -- WITH THE BILL WOULD PROPOSE THAT THEY DO IN THE MEANTIME THE BILL WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE OTHER COUNTIES WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE BILL IF I CAN'T I'VE I'VE MADE THIS REQUEST -- WANNA MAKE IT PUBLICLY IF THE BILL COULD BE AMENDED DOWN THE ROAD TO ALLOW MORE TIME IT'S GONNA GO FORWARD TO ALLOW MORE TIME FOR THE TRANSITIONING. ON THAT WOULD HAVE TO OCCUR THE BILL THAT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU THANK YOU. LIEUTENANT SHIRLEY SO WILLIAM SALMON MEDINA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ON BEHALF OF SHARE THAT MAN IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN RESOLUTION MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE CORNERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITE. SO CHAIR MEMBERS JOINT OR SOMETHING AFTER URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO HER PATH THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. SCARLETT HIS FOR THE SO I CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS PUBLIC GUARDIAN SOME PUBLIC CONSERVATIVES WERE OPPOSED. NICOLE WERE LIMON ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND UP. RAYNE XIN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO OPPOSE THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND WE LOOK FOR TO A REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- BRING HERE ANY [inaudible] QUESTION FROM [inaudible] COMMITMENT. HEARING NONE OF YOU MAY CLOSE AND HOPEFULLY YOUR YOUR DRESS. POLICE A COUPLE OF THE CONCERNS OF FOR ME ESPECIALLY TO DISCUSS ABOUT BILL. ELAINE IT GETS WITH ELAINE DEBILITATION. OF IF THAT'S FEASIBLE. WELL OR HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THEM ABOUT A CERTAIN CERTAINLY OPENED IF -- NOW IT'S THAT THE WINDS WOULD PROVE THEIR OPPOSITION THEM WAS GOING -- TO TO TO AND TO NEGOTIATE THE LIKE THE ONLY ONE TO GIVE STATE COUNTIES THAT APPROPRIATE TIME. TO MAKE THE TRANSITION BY THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THIS IS ABOUT ASSURING -- EQUAL JUSTICE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- DON'T I KEEP IN MIND YES SAN JOAQUIN FINALLY MADE THE CHANGE BUT THAT TOOK THE RESIGNATION AT THEIR FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS TO SPEAK OUT. NOW WE KNOW THAT OTHER FRIENDLY POLICIES ARE FACING THE SAME THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO COME TO A HEARING AT AT THAT SPEAK TO THE PRESS ABOUT THIS ALRIGHT SO IF YOU'RE TRAVELING IN ONE OF THOSE OTHER COUNTIES AND YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVED. AND SOMEONE DOZEN AUTOPSY WHEN YOU GO TO COURT -- THAT CORNER. CAN CHANGE THE RESULTS OF THE CELL YES A FRANTIC PATHOLOGISTS WILL PERFORM THE AUTOPSY BUT THE ACTUAL REPORT THAT THEN GOES TO THE COURT. THEY MEET THE MANNER OF DEATH WILL BE THE SAME AS THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SO INFECTED CORNERS OPPOSED IT'S BECAUSE THEIR SHARE OF COURSE THEY ARE THE SAME. SAME PERSON ADMITTED COUNTIES AND THAT'S COUNTY SO THIS IS AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. EVEN YOU KNOW YEAH SURE MOST CHAIR OF CORNERS ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT I MEAN IT'S IT'S AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST TO HAVE THE SHERIFF. CORNER ALSO BE THE PERSON WHO OVERSEES AND DECIDES ON THE FINAL REPORT TO ACTUALLY THIS WHO ACTUALLY CAN THAT. LIMIT THE INVESTIGATION OF THE POSITION -- WHOSE ACTUALLYPERFORMING THE INVESTIGATION THAT'S HAPPENED AS WELL OUT WE NEED TO BE SURE PEOPLE HAVE TRUST IN A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD BE AN OBJECTIVE FINDING OF FACT IT'S IN THE IT SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT IS. SUBJECT TO CONFLICT AND ARE PERCEIVED CONFLICT EXPECT THE ASK FOR AND I THINK YOU WILL BUT THE WE'RE GONNA PUT IT CHAIRED. RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE THAT ONE BECAUSE WORK SUBJECT HERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T WORK OUT. TO LIKE WE WE COME FROM OUR AREA HAS BOTH A SHERIFF. AND A MEDICAL EXAMINER AND THE MEDICAL EXAMINER. ACTUALLY WE HAD ONE IN THE PAST THAT WAS NOT VERY ON THAT THEY WERE DOING SOME THINGS THAT WERE VERY ETHICAL. SO IT COULD HAPPEN TO BOTH ENDS STRIKE WHICH CD DID NEED TO KEEP THEM APART AND I THINK PUT YOUR YOUR POINT HAS HOW DO WE START A SEPARATION SO WE HAVE DEALT ECONOMY. SO THAT -- MEDICAL EXAMINER SLASH FORENSIC SCIENTISTS LAST QUINCY JACK KLUGMAN TYPE OF PERSON ONLY SAY THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE WILL SMITH HERE SO. I'M GONNA. THAT WE THAT WE DO HAVE THAT. SEPARATION AND I THINK WILL ALSO HELP. LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL SOLUTIONS IF THEY'RE DOING. THE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ARRESTING THEY SHOULDN'T BE ON THE OTHER END -- LOOKING AT SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE THE SHOOTING ESPECIALLY EVEN IF AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING. ONE OF THEIR OFFICERS TO I THINK THEY WOULD EVEN ENJOY NOT BEING TOGETHER SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN. YOU OR DO SOME OF THOSE AND HOPEFULLY. THE SHERIFF AND OTHERS CONSTRUCTING BRACE THAT I THINK WILL BE BEST FOR EVERYBODY CONCERNED. WITH THAT CHURCHES RECOMMEND AYE VOTE. S. B. THIRTEEN AT THREE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER TO ANSWER AYE LACKEY CARILLO. KAMLAGER-DOVE KAMLAGER-DOVE AYE KILEY [inaudible] QUIRK [inaudible] SANTIAGO.

TO FOR TO MY WITNESSES I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT THAT THEY NOT A PROBLEM LATER. HI HOW ARE YOU GOING GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN NUMBERS. ANY ESPOSITO ASSIST INTERESTED ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY SPONSORED S. B.. FOURTEEN FORTY NINE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SEVERAL YEARS AGO. BACK WE EMBARKED ON THE TASK OF IDENTIFYING ALL UNTESTED SEXUAL SOCKETS. THIS WAS A CUMBERSOME AND PROTRACTED PROCESS. AND IN PART BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION THERE WASN'T ANY UNIFORMITY OF CONSISTENCY IN THE PRACTICE OF SELF AUDITING OR SELF REPORTING FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE LAB. AND WHEN WE ASK THE LAB ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS ANY AND TEST THE KIDS THE LOTS OF THERE WAS NOT. THAT'S BECAUSE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WERE NOT REPORTING TO THEM. WHEN IN FACT WE DISCOVER THAT NINETEEN HUNDRED UNTESTED SEXUAL SOCKETS WERE SITTING IN POLICE EVIDENCE ROOMS? TODAY THERE ARE NO UNTIES THE SEXUAL SOCKETS INCLUDING THE NINETEEN HUNDRED MANY OF THOSE SEXUAL SOCKETS PRODUCED A DNA PROFILE LINKED TO THE PERPETRATOR WHICH NOW HAS BEEN UPLOADED INTO THE CALIFORNIA DATABASE IN CODIS. WE NOW HAVE A PROCESS TEST ALL THE SEXUAL SOCKETS. BUT THE CURRENT LAW NIXON MISSION OF THE SEXUAL SOCKETS FOR TESTING BY LAW ENFORCEMENT PERMISSIVE AND NOT REQUIRED. DNA IS. AS ON EVELYN A HOSE IT IS AN AMAZING FORENSIC TOOL. ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SOLVE CRIMES AND CONVICT CRIMINALS ESPECIALLY SERIAL OFFENDERS. I'M TEST A SEXUAL SOCKETS MEAN LOST OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP DNA PROFILES. SEARCH FOR MATCHES LINK COLD CASES AND PROSECUTE OFFENDERS. BY TESTING SEXUAL SOCKETS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THE RESOLUTION AND JUSTICE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS SURVIVORS AND PREVENT SEXUAL ASSAULT CRIMES BY SERIAL OFFENDERS. FURTHERMORE TESTING SEXUAL ASSAULT KIDS CAN ALSO EXONERATE INDIVIDUALS ROLLING IDENTIFIED OR CONVICTED. THE SMALL CHANGING CURRENT LAW IN THIS BILL FROM SHOULD TO SHALL WILL ENABLE SEXUAL SOCKETS TASKS WHAT. SUBMISSION AN ANALYSIS OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE. ENSURING THERE IS NO BACKLOG IN EVIDENCE ROOMS AND OUT OR THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THEREFORE ON BEHALF OF THE ALBANY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES I AM TODAY I'M REPRESENTING NATASHA ALEXANDER GO A SURVIVOR AND CO SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION THAT COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. JUST MARRY A BRIEF STATEMENT FROM HER I'LL BE BRIEF I'M. I MISS SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR AND SURVIVOR OF THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG. SURVIVOR VOICE YEARS ARE CRITICAL IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND ALL EVERY SURVIVORS EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT MINE. IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AS A COLLEGE STUDENT IN NEW YORK CITY I WAS KIDNAPPED WHILE WALKING HOME TO MY PARTNER. THIS STRANGER I MEAN AND I'VE NEVER MET BEFORE VIOLENTLY RAPED ME AND ROBS ME AGAIN POINT. WHEN I SKIPPED AND THANKFULLY FOUND MYSELF IN MY APARTMENT MY ROOMIE INSISTED THAT I GO TO THE HOSPITAL? THE MEDICAL TEAM AT THE HOSPITAL WAS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT MY BODY WAS A CRIME SCENE. GREAT CARE WAS TAKEN AND COLLECTING THE EVIDENCE NECESSARY TO FIND MY PERPETRATOR. I ASSUMED AS DO MOST OTHER RAPE SURVIVORS THAT VALUABLE INFORMATION IN THAT CASE. THAT WAS PAINSTAKINGLY COLLECTED. WOULD BE PUT TO GOOD USE AND NOT WOULD BE DELIVERED TO A FORENSIC EXPERT AND OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSIONALS. WHO WOULD USE IT TO IDENTIFY MY ATTACKER AND BRING HIM TO JUSTICE? THERE MUST BE A REASON I WAS PUT THROUGH THE HOURS LONG EXAMINATION. HOWEVER UNBEKNOWNST TO ME MY RAPE KIT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY TESTED. AT STYLE LONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER VICTIMS KIDS IN A PLEASE EVIDENCE WAREHOUSE FOR TEN YEARS. I WAS CONTACTED BY AN INVESTIGATORS IN TWO THOUSAND THREE A FULL DECADE AFTER MY SALT TELLING ME THEY FINALLY HAD A SUSPECT. HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED AND NEVADA ON A MINOR CHARGE AND POLICE PERFORMED IT DNA CHEEKS BOB AND ENTERED HIS PROFILE. INTO THE COMBINED DNA INDEX SYSTEM OTHER NO AUTHOR. KNOWN AS CODICE. HIS PER FROM MATCH THE DNA SAMPLE COLLECTED AMERIC IT. I HAD NOT BEEN HIS ONLY VICTIM HE WAS A SERIAL RAPIST WHO HAD MADE A CAREER OUT OF ITS CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. HE WAS EVENTUALLY CONVICTED OF THIS CRIMES AGAINSTME AND OTHERS INCLUDING RAPE AND WAS SENTENCED TO FORTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON. FOR YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED A NATIONWIDE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF RAPE KITS THAT ARE BEING FOUND A POLICE EVIDENCE ROOMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THESE KIDS HAVE LINGERED IN THE QUIET DARKNESS ALONE AND FORGOTTEN GATHERING DUST AND MARKING TIME AS A STATUE OF LIMITATIONS CLOCK. SLOWLY TAKES FOR SOME THE CASES I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME TO SEE CALIFORNIA TAKING STEPS TO IN. EMPOWER SURVIVORS LIKE MYSELF THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE LA COUNTY PROFESSIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT [inaudible] ONLY [inaudible] ONE OKAY TAKEN. DAVID JONES ABOUT THE CITY SACRAMENTO WE APPLAUD THE AUTHOR ASK THE AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS CASEY O'CONNOR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR BOARD OF EQUALIZATION VICE CHAIR FIONA MONSTROS PORT THINK. TIFFANY MATHEUS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY TOMAR TOKAT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND SUPPORT YOU. BRIAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MARGOT GEORGE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- REGRETTABLY WE MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL I THINK THE FACT THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY WAS ABLE TO TEST THEIR BACKLOG. ON SHOWS WHY THIS BILL ACTUALLY ISN'T NECESSARY. AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE OPPOSING IT ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR REACHING OUT TO US TO HAVE SOME DISCUSSIONS WHICH WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. IS THAT IT PRIORITIZES RAPE CASES ABOVE EVERY OTHER TIME A VIOLENT FELONY. AND FOR ME PERSONALLY I KNOW I HAD A CLIENT WHO WAS CHARGED WITH -- ROBBERY ARMED AND IN THE COURSE OF THE ROBBERY WAS AT A CONVENIENCE STORE HIS HAT FELL OFF. AND HE SAT IN JAIL IN ALAMEDA COUNTY A FOR ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE THEY TESTED THE HALF FOR DNA. IT WAS AN EYEWITNESS CASE UP UNTIL THAT POINT AND THE DNA EXONERATED HIM. WELL WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD PUT. THE MANDATORY EVERY SINGLE RATE CASE FIRST REGARDLESS OF WHETHER. PERSONS ALREADY PLED GUILTY. ON THAT HAVE THE PERSON HAVES OWN BEEN CONVICTED -- THAT SOME THE DNA ISN'T NEEDED IN THE RAPE CASE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CONFESSION OR OTHER EVIDENCE THIS PUTS RAPE CASES ABOVE MURDER CASES [inaudible] ARMED ROBBERIES. ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON KIDNAPPING EVERY OTHER KIND OF CASE AND LIKE IN MY CASE IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO KEEP INNOCENT PEOPLE IN JAIL. FOR A VERY LONG TIME SO WE APPLAUD THE EFFORT WE BASS BEFORE. IN AN EFFORT TO DEAL WITH RATE THAT THE KIDS BE TESTED BY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD. AND BUT I DON'T THINK BAT ON THE SHOULD BE MANDATORY. THAT IN EVERY INSTANCE OF RAPE KITS TAKE PRIORITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RT AND QUESTIONS FROM QUIRK YEAH -- THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS KNOWS THAT. I CONFESSIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS TRUE. AND SO I I WOULDN'T USE THAT AS A REASON NOT TO TEST TO REST BRETT. A RAPE KIT AND I'LL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. BOB ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST QUICKLY SAY APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S VIEWPOINT BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT RAPE IS AN INCREDIBLY VIOLENT AND LIKE CHANGE THE CHANGING. EVENT THAT HAPPENS TO SOMEONE AND THIS BILL IN NO WAY PUTS THOSE RAPE KITS IN FRONT OF ANYTHING ELSE WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE LOSSES THAT THEY SHOULD BE TESTED WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE UNTESTED ODD THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXONERATE INNOCENT PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE IN JAIL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND UP BUT AND I THINK WE JUST. RIGHT NOW THE OPS IT'S HAPPENING. RAPE KITS ARE BEING PUT AT THE BOTTOM. STATE OF BEING THERE ARE EVEN BEING DONE AT ALL AND SO WE'VE HAD. I THINK WHAT THE SENATOR IS SAYING NOT TO PUT THEM UP FRONT BEGIN MAKE SURE TO GET DONE. BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO GET THEM DONE AND I DID DOES NOT A PUSH. OR IMPETUS TO GET IT DONE SO IF THERE'S SOME WORDING. THAT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE THEIR I THINK THAT THE SENATE TO BE ABSOLUTE GLAD TO SAY YOU KNOW DON'T PUT ANY OTHER CASE TO THE SIDE. NO GET THEM ALL DONE AT THE SAME TIME MEANT AND JUST DON'T LEAVE OUT RATE KATE GREAT KIDS WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO DISCUSSION. OKAY THANK YOU CHOSE RECOMMEND AYE VOTE. S. B.

ELEVEN SEVEN SEVEN WHICH PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FROM MAKING APPLICATION TO PURCHASE MORE THAN ONE FIREARM. WITHIN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD. FARMS WILL NOT BE DELIVERED WHATEVER NUCLEAR THEY'LL NOTIFIED I GOT A MOTION THIS BILL PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IT'S GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IT'S GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU AND WITH ME. IS AMANDA FROM THE BREAK CAMPAIGN. YES AMANDA WILCOX WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER TO THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE THIS IS BEEN UP PRIORITY POLICY FOR US FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. WE BELIEVE HANDGUNS ALONG AND SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME I JUST WANT YOU TO BE CLEAR WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO CURB FIREARMS TRAFFICKING. STANDS TO REASON WHEN SOMEONE'S BUYING FIFTY GUNS AT ONCE BOB AT THE TURN AROUND AND SELLING THEM ON THE BLACK MARKET CITY ANTI TRAFFICKING BILL AND THEN THE OTHER KEY POINT IS MOST -- MOST LONG GUN PURCHASERS WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL WE DID A PUBLIC RECORD REQUESTS AND FOUND THAT 82% OF LONG GUNS WERE SOLD. AS A SINGLE LONG GUN PURCHASE WITHIN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD SOME MOST LAW ABIDING GUN PURCHASERS WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED ON THE OTHER EXTREME ONE INDIVIDUAL PURCHASE A HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN GUNS WITHIN ONE MONTH. AND THOSE GUNS FOR LOWER RECEIVERS WHICH ARE BUILT UP INTO SEMI AUTOMATIC HIGH POWERED VERY LETHAL WEAPONS SO MAKE SENSE TO HAVE LONG GUN LAW IN THIS REGARD. MATCH HANDGUN LAW AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. CALLING QUICK BAY AREA STERN ACT IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. REBEKAH GONZALEZ VOLUNTEER FOR THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE SACRAMENTO VALLEY CHAPTER. JIM WYNNE BURGER ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HELLO [inaudible] GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND READ THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. ALSO YOUR FIRST YEAR PLAY I IN OPPOSITION TODAY AND SEE AND WALK INTO THE ROOM. WHERE A STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL OF THIS BILL -- FOCUSES ON LAW ABIDING IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE VERY STRINGENT GUN LAWS. AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY SINGLE TRANSFER ABSENT SOME VERY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS HAVE TO GO THROUGH A DEALER. AND THE DEALERS ARE PERFORMING A BACKGROUND CHECK THEIR CHECKING FOR FSE. EX CENTER SO. WHO'S GONNA POLICES IT'S GONNA BE A DEALER WHO'S GOING TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF LONG GOING TO CAN BE PURCHASED IN A MONTH RIGHTS OF THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT. ARE GOING TO OUR BACKGROUND CHECKS WERE BUT COMPLYING WITH OUR LAWS WHO'S NOT COMPLYING WITH OUR LAWS CRIMINALS WERE CRIMINALS GETTING THEIR FIREARMS NOT FROM DEALERS THEIR OPERATING OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM SO THIS IS NOT AN IMPACT THEM -- SOME OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL MENTIONED TRAFFICKING. AND TRAFFICKING IS RTO JR -- ADDRESSED IN OUR PENAL CODE IN LESS THE TRANSFERS ARE INFREQUENT WITHOUT REGULARITY. INDIVIDUALS ENGAGING TO TRANSFER ALL ALONG AND MUST HAVE A LICENSE. FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO THAT'S ALREADY ADDRESSED SO AGAIN WE HAVE ANOTHER BUILDING GOES RIGHT AFTER THE LAW ABIDING THAT'S NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT WHO ARE NOT GOING TO THE LEGAL CHANNELS RIGHT NOW. THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHAT DID LO MIXTURE MEMBERS ARE COMMITTEE CARGOES ABOUT FARMS POLICY COALITION OF THIS MEASURE WHICH -- WHICH DEALS WITH A CLASS. THAT'S WHAT I DID A FEW MONTHS AGO. MOM YOU KNOW. I GUESS MY MY MY CONCERN HERE IS IS THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON TO FOLLOW PUBLIC POLICY WHEN BILLS CAN BE. A AMENDED TO INCLUDE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGE I KNOW THAT THERE USED TO BE A RULE IN THE LEGISLATURE CALLED GERMANUS RULE. WHERE IF YOU'RE GOING TO AMEND THE BILL THEN THAT THE TOPIC THE NEW WHATEVER'S DEMAND AMENDED INTO THE BILL NEEDED TO BE GERMANE TO THE OLD TOPIC? I I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT RULE WENT AWAY BUT CLEARLY I DON'T SEE HOW A BILL DEALING WITH SCHOOL EMPLOYEES -- HAS TO DO ANYTHING TO DO WITH PURCHASING ONE OF FIREARM AMONG. THE IF THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DAMIANA GET YOU WANT TO PASS LAWS AND YOU WANT THE AVERAGE YOU WANT CITIZENS TO BE ABLE TO TO TAKE THE LAWS THAT ARE PASSED BY THIS BODY SERIOUSLY. THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE WHO. SETS ITS OWN RULES I MEAN THE MAJORITY PARTY GETS A CHANCE TO SET THE RULES IF THE MAJORITY PARTY IS NOT EVEN GOING TO TAKE ITS OWN RULES SERIOUSLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRO THAT THE PROPOSING OF LEGISLATION. WELL THEN HOW WITH THE AVERAGE CITIZEN TO TAKE THE LAWS THAT ARE PASSED OUT OF THIS LEGISLATURE SERIOUSLY. I THOUGHT I I WILL CONTEND THIS BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE THE THE POWER. YOU DO IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHEN YOU ESTABLISH RULES AT THE VERY LEAST THIS BODY OUGHT TO FOLLOW THE RULES THAT IT IS SAID. THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL ARE NOT GERMANE TO THE ORIGINAL TOPIC I DON'T SEE HOW ANYBODY A WHO CLAIMS TO BE LITERATE CAN READ IT AND SAY THAT IS GERMANE TO THE ORIGINAL TOPIC. AND THEREFORE I THINK THIS BILL SHOULD BE REJECTED [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] IF YOU. CHAIRMAN A MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA. A IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HAS BEEN STATED -- BY MY COLLEAGUES HERE BOTH ON ON ON THE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE OF THE BILL AND ON THE THE PROCESS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND WHEN IT IS NOT -- FOLLOWING ITS OWN RULES IT IT IT IT REALLY CAST A PALL. OF THAT IS NEGATIVE ON THIS AUGUST BODY -- I WORK FOR A A MAN WHO SERVED IN THIS LEGISLATURE FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS [inaudible] AND STILL HOLDS IT IN RED AND REFERENCE -- AND AND SO THAT SO WHY HE'S PASSED THAT ON TO US. WITH REGARDS TO THE SPECIFICS OF THIS BILL. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THERE IS A IN ANY SORT OF A TRAFFICKING OF LONG GUNS FROM LEGAL PURCHASES. THAT WOULD BE THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. AND TO TO TO CHARGE PERSONS WITH THE CRIME WITH THE EASIEST. SO THIS BILL IN EFFECT ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO COMPLY WITH THE LAW WHICH IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SO IN ORDER TO KAT. ME BE A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE. YOU ARE IMPOSING OR RESTRICTING THE RIGHTS. OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WE THINK THAT IT IS -- NOT ONLY UNWISE WE BELIEVE IT TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND CERTAINLY UNFAIR -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN A PILE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I CAN'T BE LUNCH REPRESENT THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION SPY CLUB INTERNATIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTS WAS COALITION CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY ON STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MY NAME IS WHY JOHN AND I'M AN INTERNET GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIAN ALSO REPRESENTING YOUNG GUN OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA STRONGLY OPPOSED. THANK YOU SIR. MEMBERS. THEN YOU MAY CLOSE AND AND IN YOUR CLOSING AYE I KNOW -- TO PORTANTINO YOU'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN BOTH HOUSES YOU KNOW PUBLIC NO RULES BETTER DAY. YOU'VE BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE HE PROBABLY KNOWS THE RULES BETTER ANYBODY ELSE IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD. ABSOLUTELY OUT IN A RASH ON MY HEAD I CAN ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS OF FIRST OF ALL THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET -- SO THAT'S WHY THE REGIONAL BELL WAS IN ESSENCE NO LONGER NEEDED BOTH HOUSES MADE AN AGREEMENT TO NOT MOVE -- BILLS THAT HAD BEEN IN THE BUDGET THE STATE FRANKLY HAD INVESTED IN THAT VEHICLE -- TO GET THIS FAR ON THIS IS NOT A NEW POLICY -- THIS IS A POLICY THAT THIS COMMITTEES VERY FAMILIAR WITH SO WAS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE AND WITHIN THE RULES TO PUT -- THE CONTENTS INTO THAT BELLOWS REFERRED. LEGALLY YOU KNOW THROUGH ALL THE PROPER CHANNELS SO ARE IT'S OFTEN SOMETHING PEOPLE. BRING UP WHEN A BILL CHANGES ITS CONTENT IN THE PROCESS PEOPLE WILL CRY FOUL BUT THERE THERE IS NO FOUL NO FOUL WAS COMMITTED. WERE HAVING THIS HEARING PUBLIC ON TELEVISION SO. THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS INCOME. WEIGHED IN AND MAKE THEIR CASE -- SO AGAIN NO VIOLATION OF CERTAINLY THIS COMMITTEE WOULD NOT BE PARTY TO ANY VIOLATION OF ANY ROLE SO -- WITH THAT AS I SAID THIS POLICY IS PASS THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE. THE REASON WHY WE MOVED IT OUT OF THE OTHER BILL AS WE WANTED EACH BILL TO BE CLEAN SO. GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY FRANKLY TO HAVE FURTHER COMMENTS THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT THESE SO AND NO ONE SHOULD BE. UNDER THE ILLUSION THAT THIS PARTICULAR POLICY HAS NOT BEEN VETTED DISCUSSED -- ADD INFINITUM AND AGAIN TODAY SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU IN THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE AND IN. SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION [inaudible] AND CLARIFICATION. OVERALL SB ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE AYE JONES ARE AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO CARILLO. CARILLO AYE KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I KILEY QUIRK QUIRK ICE SANTIAGO. THAT MEASURE PASSED. AND I WILL NOT BE PRESENTING AT TWELVE SIX THANK YOU MISTER PORTANTINO CENTER PARK HERE I DO SEE YOU THERE MR GLAZER SENATOR GLAZER PLEASE GO. THANK YOU FOR FORGETTING HERE THAT. BUT A VERY BUSY DAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THAT THIS BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE PEOPLE CONVICTED OF SOLICITING OR ENGAGING IN PROSTITUTION WITH A MINOR. TO PROVIDE DNA SAMPLES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFICATION ANALYSIS. WHEN THE NEW TIERED REGISTRY TAKES EFFECT IN? TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THOSE WHO ARE CONVICTED TWO REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS FOR TEN YEARS. WHICH IS THE LOWEST HERE. THIS BILL ALLOWS THOSE WHO ARE CONVICTED TO AVOID REGISTERING AS A SEX OFFENDER IF. THEY HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THE VICTIM WAS NOT A MINOR. WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIM'S AGE OR LESS THAN THREE YEARS OLDER THAN THE VICTIM AT THE TIME OF THE SOLICITATION? IN A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE OAKLAND SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT. THIS FOUND THAT 85% OF UNSOLVED MURDERS IN THE CITY INVOLVED A PROSTITUTE. MINORS ARE ESPECIALLY AT RISK. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ALONE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MINORS WERE RESCUED FROM PROSTITUTION. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM PARTICULAR TO OAKLAND. OF ALL THE PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR SOLICITING A PROSTITUTE TWO THIRDS WERE FROM OUTSIDE OF OAKLAND. INCLUDING SEVEN OTHER COUNTIES. WITH NO MAJOR METRO POLITICIAN AREA UNTOUCHED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKING A STATEWIDE RESPONSES REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THOSE TO PERPETUATE THE SYSTEM. OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE'S MADE GREAT PROGRESS TO PROTECT MINORS WHO WERE VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. THIS BILL REINFORCES OUR PRIOR EFFORTS BY ADDRESSING THOSE THAT CREATED DEMAND FOR THE TRAFFICKING OF MINORS. HAVE WORKED TO MAKE THIS A BIPARTISAN BILL. THAT NARROWLY TARGETS THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE THE SYSTEM THAT PREYS ON MINORS. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL WAS ABLE TO CLEAR THE SENATE FLORIDA THIRTY NINE TWO ZERO VOTE. THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I'M JOINED BY SOME WONDERFUL WITNESSES WHICH I HOPE WILL PROVIDE [inaudible] ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY YES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS ANY ESPOSITO ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY REPRESENTING ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY IN SUPPORT OF SB. SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE PEOPLE CONVICTED OF ILLEGALLY PAYING FOR SEX TO PROVIDE DNA SAMPLES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFICATION ANALYSIS. IT WOULD ALSO HELP IDENTIFY BUYERS OF SEX PLATH SEXUALLY ASSAULTED SOMEONE IN THE PAST OR ATTEMPTED TO PURCHASE SEXUALLY. EXPLOITED MINERS. BUYERS OF SEX PERPETUATE SEX TRAFFICKING BY CREATING DEMAND FOR IT. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO PROTECT MINORS NOT ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS THOSE THAT PERPETUATE THE SYSTEM. AS LONG AS THERE IS A DEMAND. THERE WILL BE AN EXPLOITER TO FILL IT. INDIVIDUALS WHO PURCHASE HUMAN BEINGS FOR SEX FUELED THE MARKET. THAT TRAFFICKERS SUPPLY WITH VICTIMS. UNTIL WE ELIMINATE THAT DEMAND. AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH DEMAND. SEX EXPLOITATION OF OUR SOCIETY'S MOST VULNERABLE GIRLS WOMEN AND MORE MEN AND BOYS WILL CONTINUE. AND THIS BILL. IT TARGETS THAT DEMAND SEEKING TO ELIMINATE IT. SO ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPOD [inaudible] THANK YOU. BUT JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION -- THE CALIFORNIA NARCOTICS OFFICERS ASSOCIATION LOS ANGELES COUNTY PROFESSIONAL PEACE OFFICER SAYS I ASSOCIATION. AND THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE BY MAY BE PERMITTED A BRIEF HISTORICAL A REFERENCE. AS A YOUNG PROSECUTOR WITH THE LA CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE I PROSECUTED THE FIRST CASES THAT WERE BROUGHT. AGAINST CUSTOMERS -- FOR FOR HOW OLD ARE YOU. WHO DEAL WITH IT? BOB OUT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SHARE MEMBERS COURCELLES ALONG WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MARCO GEORGE -- FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUB PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION THEN OPPOSITION -- I WON'T SAY BAD I DEFENDED THOSE FIRST CASE THAT A NOT QUITE BUT I'VE HAD A FEW -- WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE REALLY THE THREE TIERED SEX OFFENDER SYSTEM. OF REGISTRATION WAS JUST ENACTED LAST YEAR -- IT HAS HAS NOT GONE INTO EFFECT IN THIS TOO EARLY TO START CHANGING THE RULE. THE RULES THERE ALREADY ARE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES -- FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANORS SEX OFFENSES WITH MINORS THEY'RE REQUIRED TO REGISTER FOR A MINIMUM PERIOD OF TEN YEARS -- IT'S EXTENDED FOR ANY OTHER CONVICTIONS OR THEY'D HAVE TO PETITION THE COURT FOR AN ORDER TERMINATING THAT REQUIREMENTS. AND IF THE PROSECUTOR REQUEST A HEARING ON THE PETITION TO TERMINATE THE REGISTRATION ORDER -- THE HEARING TAKES PLACE AND THE COURT DETERMINES THAT THE HEARING IF THE CONVICTED PERSON. US STILL POSES A RISK OF RE OFFENSE. SO ON SB -- SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN ALTHOUGH HE AND I'M SURE WE'RE ALL WOULD LIKE PAN SEX TRAFFICKING. AND ESPECIALLY SEX TRAFFICKING OF MINORS. BUT THERE'S NO STUDY THAT'S EVER CONCLUDED THAT INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF SOLICITING A PROSTITUTE. RE OFFEND AFTER APPREHENSION AND CONVICTION AT A HIGHER RATE THAN. DO THOSE CONVICTED OF OTHER MISDEMEANOR SEX CRIMES INVOLVING A MINOR. ON AND TO THE CONTRARY MEN ARRESTED AND PROSECUTED FOR SOLICITING A PROSTITUTE. THE MAP THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE LITTLE OR NO CRIMINAL HISTORIES -- MANY OF THEM ARE OLDER AND MANY OF THEM ARE FOR MORE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED EDUCATED AND EITHER MARRIED OR IN RELATIONSHIPS. RARELY RE OFFEND IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TARGETED PROSTITUTES CHRONOLOGICAL AGE. SO THIS WOULD BE -- THIS WOULD BE PUBLIC POLICY THAT IS NOT EVIDENCE BASED IT'S NOT FACT BASED. WE ENACTED LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE DID. LEGISLATION THAT WAS. AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT LEGISLATION WAS TO HAVE PEOPLE REGISTER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR RISK [inaudible] AND ABOUT WAS DONE NOT JUST TO GIVE THE CITIZENS WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF A SEX OFFENSE A CHANCE TO REHABILITATE THEMSELVES. BUT IT WAS DONE TO MAKE US ALL SAFER. BECAUSE WHEN POLICE DEPARTMENTS EXPEND RESOURCES ON TRACKING DOWN EVERY SEX OFFENDER REGARDLESS OF THEIR OWN LEVEL OF RISK CORD LIKELIHOOD TO REOFFEND. THAT MEANS THOSE RESOURCES ARE NOT USE. TO PURSUE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE DANGEROUS. AND TO PROTECT THE CITIZENRY SO. ONE MIGHT SAY THAT THIS. BILL WOULD ACTUALLY -- HURT NOT HELP -- WELL I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT TO THIS DOCTOR ROUGH TOOK -- FOLLOW UP WITH THAT SORT OF THE LEGAL RATIONALE AND QUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST LIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA RECORD REGRETFULLY WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE SPELL AS WELL FOR THREE KEY REASONS I FIRST WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT WHILE PEOPLE OF ALL RACES ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS AND SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS PURCHASE COMMERCIAL SACKS LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LGBTQ PEOPLE ARE THE ONES TYPICALLY ARRESTED CHARGED AND CONVICTED FOR THESE OF FUNDS AS SAN FRANCISCO'S PUBLIC DEFENDER RECENTLY REPORTED THAT 60% OF PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR LOITERING WITH. INTENT TO COMMIT PROSTITUTION IN THE CITY ARE LATINO. AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO REGULARLY TARGET AND ARREST GAY MEN ON CHARGES OF SOLICITATION AND OTHER OFFENSES. GIVEN THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT SOLICITATION LAWS ALREADY HAVE ON THESE COMMUNITIES REQUIRING REGISTRATION WILL RESULT IN FURTHER BURDEN. SECOND EVEN THOUGH AS THE AUTHOR'S NOTES AND MY COLLEAGUE THAT THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY HAS BEEN REFORMED AND THAT THIS BILL WILL NO LONGER IMPLICATE LIFETIME REGISTRATION. A DECADE ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY COULD STILL HAVE LIFETIME CONSEQUENCES FOR INDIVIDUALS PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF COLOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND LGBTQ PEOPLE. INCLUSION ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET A JOB FIND HOUSING PARENT AND REHABILITATE. INCLUSION ON REGS ON THE REGISTRATION CAN ALSO BE DESTABILIZING OTHER WAYS SUCH AS CAUSING PEOPLE TO FALL INTO DEPRESSION AND EXACERBATING OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THIS TYPE OF DESTABILIZATION CAN ALSO LEAD TO RECIDIVISM. AND LASTLY THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY CURRENT LAW ALREADY REQUIRES THAT ANY ADULT WHO ACTUALLY ENGAGES IN A SEX ACT WITH A MINOR BE CONVICTED OF A FELONY. WHICH WOULD AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRE DNA COLLECTION AND SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION. ADDITIONALLY COURTS ALREADY HAVE THE DISCRETION TO REQUIRE ANYONE CONVICTED OF MISS IT MISDEMEANOR SOLICITATION TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER WHEN APPROPRIATE. SO LONG AS THE COURT FINDS THAT THE PERSON COMMITTED THE CRIME FOR SEXUAL GRATIFICATION. UNDER CURRENT LAW ANYONE WHO IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER ALSO HAS TO SUBMIT DNA. IN THIS WAY CURRENT LAW IS PREFERABLE IN THAT IT ALLOWS FOR A CASE BY CASE DETERMINATIONS AND DOESN'T UNNECESSARILY CAPTURE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELONG ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY OR IN THE DNA DATABASE. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU ARMENIA AND WHAT ELSE IN OPPOSITION. MAKE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FOR YOU MAY CLOSE UP FULLER THERE'RE LACKEY. YEAH I'M A CLEAR GOING TO BE SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE. IT SEEMS TO PLACE THE THE BURDEN OF PROOF ON THE DEFENDANT RATHER THAN THE PROSECUTION. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ROUTE OF RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT SHOULD INCLUDE REQUIRING PROOF OF THE DEFENDANT KNEW OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE VICTIM WAS A MINOR. THE WORD SOLICITATION SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING CRIME COVERS ADDITIONAL LACKS THE TERM. THE COURT FINDS SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED. AND THAT'S ALL. ANYONE ELSE YOU MAY CLOSE LANKY OTHER MEMBERS FOR HERE IN THE BILL I HAD TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY I THINK THOSE ARE SUGGESTIONS LIKE CERTAINLY INCORPORATE. AYE IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD LET ME JUST SAY A COUPLE THINGS FIRST I I VOTED FOR THE REGISTRY CHANGE LAST YEAR. AND IN A WAS CAREFULLY CRAFTED -- TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VARIOUS OFFENSES THAT THAT WOULD PUT SOMEONE ON THAT LIST AND ARE ALL ALL THAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED IN THIS BILL AS THEY GO ON AT THE LOWEST HERE I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO INTERFERE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY. TO TO MONITOR THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST SERIOUS OFFENDERS ON THAT LIST -- BUT IT DOES HAVE THEIR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ON THAT ISSUE I WANT TO JUST IDENTIFY THAT. IF THERE IS A CHOICE IN THIS BILL THAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME WOULD NOT BE THE REGISTRY ISSUE WOULD BE WOULD BE THE CAPTION AT THE DNA -- AND THIS BILL WAS BROADER WHEN IT WAS HEARD IN THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. AND IT WAS THROUGH THE GOOD WORK OF THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF THAT IT WAS NARROWED TO THIS PLACE UP. OF ONLY TAKING DNA FROM AYE THOSE A CONVICTED OF GAUGING BRING PROSTITUTION WITH A MINOR. I THINK THAT WAS A COMPROMISE THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT AT THE TIME BUT IT IS WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I THINK IT IS A STEP OF MODEST VERY MODEST STEP FORWARD IN TRYING TO ACTUALLY CATCH BAD PEOPLE -- WHOEVER THEY ARE WHEREVER THEY ARE THAT I'VE IF DATA. THAT BAD SEX WITH A MINOR AS A PRECURSOR TO SOMEONE WHO COMMITS MURDER OR RAPE OR OTHER MORE SERIOUS CRIMES. WE CERTAINLY -- I THINK THERE'S OF A FINE I DON'T APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF TO HAVE. BEING ABLE TO TAKE THAT SWAB IN THAT DNA. UPON THAT PERSONS THAT -- CONVICTION AND ALLOWING US TO A FIFTH OF THE COURSE OF THINGS THAT WE FIND THAT THEY KICK A COMMITTED A MUCH MORE SERIOUS CRIMES SO. I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO PROTECT OUR MINERS THEY KNOW THERE'S NO DIFFERENCES REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS. ON THIS PANEL. AND I THINK THIS BILL IS THAT MODEST STEP FORWARD AND IF THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THE REGISTRY. OR MAKE A CHOICE MISTER CHAIRMAN REPEATED MAINTAIN THE DNA COLLECTION WILL WORK CAN EITHER WORK IN IN FUTURE YEARS ON THE REGISTRY ISSUE. THANK YOU AND AT IT AND I KNOW YOU VERY SINCERE ABOUT THIS AND OTHERS. TO IN ALPHA NO YOU WITNESSES VERY WELL THAT -- THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE UNLESS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER -- VALLEY JUST YOU BUT WHAT DID -- SO I'M NOT TOTALLY A HYPOCRITE. WILL I ALWAYS SIDE WITH OF DIESEL EXISTING LAW WE CAN DO IT. WITH THAT LAW THAT WE SHOULD ADD ON TOP OF THAT. I KNOW WE WOULD JUST COMMITTEE HAS ADDED ON FOR A MINUTE. TOTALLY HYPOCRITICAL BUT MOST IS TIED THAT IS BECAUSE YOU MAY BE LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW OR IS NOT REALLY CLEAR OR SOMEONE OR ITS NOT BEING -- IMPLEMENTED. AT ALL AND THAT'S WHY SOMETIMES WE DO. WE DO ALL THE LAW THAT KINDA CLARIFIES PUTS IN STATUTE WHICH IS ALREADY WHAT ARE A SHOULD BE DONE AND SO ON IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE THAT BEFORE. OF IN THIS INSTANCE -- AYE AYE DICTATE THE OPPONENTS HAVE A VALID REASON THAT. THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE AT THAT COURTS HAVE THE DISCRETION THAT ANYONE DOES THIS PARTICULAR CRIME. THAT OF BE ABLE TO LIVE THE COURTS HAVE THE DISCRETION OF TO GO AHEAD AND NOT ONLY FOR THE REGISTRY BUT ALSO [inaudible] AND TAKE DNA SAMPLES AND SO FOR THAT ONE READ THE SECOND IS DION. I'M WANTED WHEN I GOT HERE TWENTY TWELVE I GOT BEATEN UP ON THEIR OTHER REGISTRY IN A SEXUAL OFFENDER REGISTRY COULD THAT THE LA DA WANTED US TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. AND IT TOOK. UNTIL LAST YEAR -- I CARRIED THE FIRST BILL ON THAT AND WAS. VICIOUS RATED ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE I WANTED TO HELP SEX OFFENDERS THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED TO DO. AND I'M GLAD WE GOT TO A POINT NOW WHERE WE ACTUALLY REFORMING. THE THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY SO MY SECOND ISSUE IS ALWAYS IMPLEMENTATION. THAT WE GIVE THINGS TIME TO TO BE UP ABOUT IT SO WE CAN SEE IF IT WORKS OR NOT. AND SO OF LOS TO REASON FORTUNATELY -- I WOULD RECOMMEND A NO VOTE -- AND IF THINGS AREN'T WORKING OUT AFTER IS IMPLEMENTED AND ANY SOME CHANGES. OR YOU NEED SOME CLERICAL WE NEED SOME CLARIFICATION AND IF. YOU WANNA WILL WORK TOGETHER ON A BILL THAT KIND OF GET SO THAT% I BE HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT AS TODAY UNFORTUNATELY THE RECOMMENDED OVER [inaudible] SECOND. MEDICARE CALL THE ROLL. S. B.

YOU MAY BEGIN LOOKING LOOPHOLE IN OUR OUR GUN SAFETY LAWS -- SP TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR KEEPING THE COMMITTEE WAITING I APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY HERE BUT ALL JUVENILES DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE EVEN IF THEY COMMIT A CRIME. ZERO CHANCE TO GET A CREDIT CARD LOAN -- ZERO CHANCE TO GO. RENT AN APARTMENT GET A JOB WITHOUT FEAR RETRIBUTION OR SOME PALL HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS BUT THAT THE PREMISES BILLS THAT YOU FORFEIT YOUR RIGHT TO PURCHASE FIREARM IF YOU MAKE. THOSE BAD DECISIONS THE YOUNG PERSON AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK DR OF THANK YOU HIGH. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY TOMATO FOUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. OFFICE AYE WERE PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS BILL -- OUR JOB AS PROSECUTORSIS TO ENFORCE OUR CRIME LAWS AND ONE OF THOSE LAWS -- IS A FIREARM LAW THAT BASICALLY SAYS THAT A PERSON -- MAY NOT OWN OR POSSESS A GUN UNTIL THE AGE OF THIRTY IF THEY ARE AS JUVENILES COMMITTED CERTAIN TYPES OF OFFENSES SUCH AS ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON CRIMINAL THREATS ETCETERA. BUT CURRENTLY THERE'S A CONFLICT BETWEEN -- OUR FIREARMS LAW AND ARE JUVENILES -- BECAUSE IN THE JUVENILE COURTS RECORDS ARE BEING ORDERED SEALED AND THEN THEY'RE BEING ORDERED DESTROYED -- AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. AND IN FACT OF MANY OF THESE RECORDS ARE BEING DESTROYED OF FIVE YEARS AFTER SEALING. AND THE CURRENT JUVENILE SEALING LAWS DO NOT MAKE AN EXCEPTION TO ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SEALED RECORDS AND THEY WILL REMAIN SEALED. UNDER THIS BILL ARM BUT THERE'S NO EXCEPTION MADE FOR PROSECUTORS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SEALED RECORDS IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S BEEN A VIOLATION OF THE LAW FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SOMEBODY TURNS. TWENTY EIGHT OR TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD AND THEY'RE FOUND IN POSSESSION OF A GUN IF THE RECORDS ARE DESTROYED WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A RESTRICTION ON THE THEIR WELL OWNING OR POSSESSING A GUN -- UNTIL THE AGE OF THIRTY SO FOR THAT REASON ALL WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST -- AN AYE VOTE SO THAT'S WE CAN RESOLVE THE CONFLICT AND THAT WE CAN -- BETTER -- AND EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE OUR FIREARMS LAWS THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] YES. I AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER TO THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE WE ARE IN SUPPORT KNOW OUR SIGNATURE ISSUE IS. BACKGROUND CHECKS -- I'M EVERY GUN SALES SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE PROHIBITED CANNOT PURCHASE A FIREARM IN THAT'S BASED ON THE BELIEF THAT THERE ARE THOSE. WHO BASED ON THEIR CONDITIONER PAST BEHAVIOR A GREATER RISK OF -- COMMITTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND PAST VIOLENT BEHAVIOR IS A PREDICTOR OF FUTURE ACTS OF VIOLENCE ON TOP OF THAT YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY -- IMPACTED AND WITH CRIME AND OF VICTIMS OF OF GUN VIOLENCE IF IF ONE VIEWS A CHART OF HOMICIDE FIREARM HOMICIDES. ARE IT DRAMATICALLY. DROPS AFTER ABOUT AGE THIRTY TWO SO YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE SO SHADED WITH -- FIREARM HOMICIDES THAT'S CLEAR. BEHAVE IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE PROHIBITION IS ENFORCEABLE TO AGE THIRTY THREE IN THE MY UNDERSTANDING IS RIGHT NOW. DEPARTMENT JUST JUSTICE CANNOT DO CONSISTENT ART BACKGROUND CHECK BECAUSE OF THE SEALED RECORDS ISSUE THEREFORE WE'RE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OF OUR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CALLING QUICK BAY AREA STERN ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. TIFFANY MATHIS SOME BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MARCO GEORGE WHEN YOU PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION A REGRETFULLY REGRETFULLY WE MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL -- AND THEIR TWO REASONS -- ONE OVERALL IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S CHIPPING AWAY AT THE JUVENILE RECORD CEILING. AND THEN TO THE SECOND REASON IS THIS IS ACTUALLY -- THE LEGISLATION IS REDUNDANT AND UNNECESSARY. AND CREATES AN ARBITRARY DATE TO DESTROY THE SEALED JUVENILE RECORDS BEYOND THE STATUTORY TIME PERIOD A PERSON CAN BE RESTRICTED FROM POSSESSING A FIREARM UNDER EXISTING LAW. SO -- THE CASE THAT THE THE ADVOCATES HAVE SIDED AND ENRAGE OFF TO WORK THE COURT OF APPEAL CASE. IT SAID IT HAS ALREADY RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. IT'S STATED AND THIS IS IN REGARD TO TO STATUTES ONE IS IN THE WELFARE AN INSTITUTIONAL CHO. ON SEVEN EIGHTY SIX THE OTHER ONE IS THE PENAL CODE STATUTE THAT BARS GUN OWNERSHIP -- FOR JUVENILES WHO BEEN CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANORS BUT HAVE HAD THEIR RECORD SEALED UNDER THE WELFARE AN INSTITUTION CODE SECTION AND IT IT HAD THIS ISSUE. AND IT SAID WE FIND THE STATUTES CAN BE RECONCILED AS ALWAYS OUR ROLE IN STATUTORY INTERPRETATION IS TO A AFFECT THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. THEREFORE ALTHOUGH WELFARE INSTITUTION CODE SECTION SEVEN EIGHTY SIX REQUIRES SEALING THE RECORD THE FORM DESCRIBED IN PENAL CODE SECTION. TWENTY NINE EIGHT TWENTY SUBDIVISION DE IS EXEMPT FROM THE REQUIREMENT OF DESTRUCTION FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE. OF DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY TO ACQUIRE A FIREARM THIS WHILE THE REST OF THE RECORD MUST BE SEALED AND DESTROYED BY THE DATE THE DOOR COURT SPECIFIES. IN THE ORDER IT WILL ISSUE AFTER REMAND THE FIRE ARM FORM NEED NOT BE DOES ORDERED DESTROYED UNTIL. THE INDIVIDUALS THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY SO WE AND THEY WENT ON TO SAY WE BELIEVE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LOWER REQUIRES THIS OUTCOME AND FURTHER SUPPLY MARY PURPOSE. OF BOTH STATUTES. THE GOAL BEHIND WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION SEVEN EIGHTY SIX AS WE READ THE STATUTE IS TO ALLOW CERTAIN JUVENILE OFFENDERS WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THEIR PROBATION. TO LEAD PRODUCTIVE LIVES WITHOUT THE BLACK MARK OVER RECORD HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS FOR EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. THE ONLY PURPOSE OF SECTION. TWO NINE EIGHT TWO OH IS TO PREVENT THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CERTAIN OFFENSES AS JUVENILES FROM OWNING FIREARMS BEFORE THEY TURN. THIRTY BOARDING ORDERING THE RECORD SEALED AS REQUIRED BY THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION. SEVEN EIGHTY SIX WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO MAINTAIN THE FIRE ARM FORM UNTIL JOSH WHAT. TURNS THIRTY THAT WAS BUT GAME NAME OF THE YOUNG MAN AND THE CASE WILL SERVE BOTH PURPOSES. AND FOR THAT PURPOSE. ON THE FIFTH. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS PROMULGATED -- A FORM. AND THIS IS THE FORM THAT THEY USE ACTUALLY A TWO US SEAL THE RECORD UNDER. SEVEN EIGHTY SIX AND ON THE BACK OF THE FORM IT SAYS -- UNDER NUMBER EIGHT ALL RECORDS PERTAINING TO THE DISMISSED PETITION ARE TO BE DESTROYED ON THE DATE STATED IN THE SIDE THEM IN THEIR ARREST IS DEEMED EVER TO UP KURT. EXCEPT THAT THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY PROBATION OFFICER CHILD WELFARE AGENCY AND COURT MAY ACCESS THESE RECORDS FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES STATED IN WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION. SEVEN EIGHTY SIX SO IT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO ASK TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE RECORDS. AND THEN THERE'S AN A IN THE BE AND IT HAS THE COURT OFFICER RIGHTS IN THE DATE THE COURT RECORDS MUST BE DESTROYED. SO IF THE INDIVIDUAL WAS TO BE SUBJECT TO THIS THIRTY YEAR ON PROHIBITION OF NO GUNS. THE COURT OFFICER RIGHTS IN THE INDIVIDUALS THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY THE DA IS PRESENT WHEN THESE RECORDS ARE SEALED ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SAY. JUDGE THIS PERSON IS GONNA MANDATORY GUN PROHIBITION CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THESE RECORDS ARE DESTROYED UNTIL HIS OR HER THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY. AND THEN IT SAYS ON BE DATE ALL OTHER RECORDS MUST BE TO DESTROY COULD YOU WRAP UP SURE. SO MANY JUST RIGHT IN THE SAME THING SO THERE IS THIS IS A SOLUTION WE FEEL. WITHOUT A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEEN SOLVED AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL AND ASK REARED UP. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. I KNOW IN THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE A TIMING ISSUE SO I'M WANNA SAY THAT I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE BILL BUT I DIDN'T READ AND I HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- ESSENTIALLY ABOUT -- ALLOWING THE D. A.'S OFFICE TO GO IN AND POKE AROUND -- UNTIL OF THE PERSON IS -- YOU KNOW THIRTY THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD AND SO I'M I'M HOPING YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW FOR SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT OR CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT FOLKS LIKE. TO HAVE AS WIDE A SCOPE AS POSSIBLE WHEN THEY WANT TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT RECORDS AND WHILE I DO SEE THAT IT STATES IT'S SPECIFIC FOR THE PURPOSES RATE RELATED TO A FIREARM ENFORCEMENT. YOU KNOW WE SORT OF OPEN ADORN ALLOW FOR A SLIPPERY SLOPE SO I HOPE SOMEWHERE IN THERE THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE THAT ALSO TALKS ABOUT CONSEQUENCES TO USING THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO NOT JUST FOCUS ON FIREARMS. THANK YOU YOU MAY CLOSE -- IN RE JOSHUA THE CASE THAT THIS THIS BILL EMANATES FROM ALSO STATED THAT. THE THE VIOLATIONS -- THAT OCCURRED MAY MAKE ENFORCEMENT OF THAT PENAL CODE PROVISION MORE DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE AND THAT THE STATUTORY. CONFUSION -- SHOULD ACTUALLY BE IT RESOLVED BY LEGISLATIVE FIX -- AYE AYE AYE GRANT THAT THERE'S ALSO A REVISION OF THE FIREARM FORM -- I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE TO SAY FOR THIS POINT TO TO RELY JUST ON A FORM I THINK THIS THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO STEP IN AND I DO -- WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE MISCONDUCT OR DOVES POINT THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE -- A SORT OF ENTRY POINT FOR A BUNCH OF DIGGING IN POKING AROUND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A VERY SURGICAL CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. IT'S STRICTLY ABOUT THE FIREARM BUT I WILL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT AND I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORT SO. THANK YOU MAKE A FAST RIDE VOTE.
