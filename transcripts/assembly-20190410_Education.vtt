00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.669
WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THIS IS A

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.471
TOPIC OF MUCH DISCUSSION INSIDE

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:07.672
THIS CAPITAL AND OUTSIDE THIS

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:09.541
CAPITAL.

00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:11.142
IN FACT THERE ARE MANY RECENT

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:12.744
AND NOT SO RECENT MEDIA REPORTS

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.012
ABOUT THE NEED TO REFORM THE

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:15.380
CURRENT PROCESS.

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:17.048
NOT TO ELIMINATE IT BUT TO

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.349
REFORM IT IN FACT THERE BEEN

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:19.817
MANY MEDIA REPORTS HERE SOME

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:21.152
HEADLINES RECENT.

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:23.388
CALIFORNIA'S BROKEN CHARTER

00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:26.291
SCHOOL LAW HAS DEFIED REFORM.

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:27.825
CAN NEWSOME BREAK THE GRIDLOCK.

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:30.628
HOW A COUPLE WORK CHARTER SCHOOL

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:32.730
REGULATIONS TO MAKE MILLIONS?

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:34.766
SMALL DISTRICTS REAP BIG PROFITS

00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:36.668
BY APPROVING CHARTER SCHOOLS

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.536
WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT.

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:39.971
HOW A TINY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:42.273
DISTRICT SPARK CALLS FOR CHARTER

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.808
CRACKDOWN?

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:45.476
CELEBRITY CHARTER SCHOOL FOUNDER

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:46.878
TO PLEAD GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY

00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:48.346
CHARGES.

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:49.847
PROSECUTORS SAID.

00:30:49.914 --> 00:30:53.518
AND THERE ARE MANY MORE.

00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:54.986
AGAIN RECENT ARTICLES IN LEGAL

00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:56.854
PROCEEDINGS DOCUMENT THE REASONS

00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:58.923
WHY IT IS TIME TO REFORM CHARTER

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.425
SCHOOL OUT LAWS IN THE STATE OF

00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:01.359
CALIFORNIA.

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:02.694
AND LET'S REMEMBER THERE ARE

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.328
MORE CHARTERS IN THE STATE OF

00:31:03.394 --> 00:31:05.496
CALIFORNIA THEN THERE ARE SCHOOL

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:06.898
DISTRICTS.

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:08.466
CLEARLY SOME BUT NOT ALL.

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:09.534
CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE TAKEN

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:11.069
ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAKNESSES IN

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:11.936
CURRENT LAW.

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.238
WHICH IS LED TO PERSISTENT

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:14.772
CORRUPTION AND DAMAGE TO OUR

00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:16.541
DISTRICT SCHOOLS AND ALL

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:17.075
STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:17.909
CALIFORNIA.

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:20.745
CLEARLY WE NEED TO SHORE UP THIS

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:21.646
LAW.

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.014
THIS LAW DOES NOT GET RID OF

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:24.682
CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT SHORES UP A

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:26.651
LAW THAT AUTHORIZES AND OVER

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.953
PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF CHARTER

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.522
SCHOOLS -- LAWS ALLOW THOSE

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:33.691
SEEKING TO OPEN A CHARTER SCHOL

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.059
TO GO AUTHORIZED YOUR SHOPPING.

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:36.761
SIMPLY PUT WAS AUTHORIZING

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:38.129
SHOPPING ME.

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:39.998
SIMPLY PUT THIS MEANS THAT AFTER

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.532
BEING REJECTED BY ONE BOARD THEY

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:42.600
CAN GO SEARCHING FOR AN OTHER

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:45.003
BOARD FOR APPROVAL AND THIS IS

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:45.870
OFTEN HAPPEN.

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:48.239
WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:49.340
THE DISTRICT WHERE THE CHARTER

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:51.175
IS LOCATED NOT ONLY LOSES THEIR

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:52.810
STUDENTS TO A SCHOOL THEY DID

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:53.378
NOT BELIEVE WHAT'S BEST FOR

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:54.512
THEIR STUDENTS.

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:56.381
BUT MUST PROVIDE FACILITIES AND

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:58.349
OTHERWISE A COMEDY THAT CHARTER

00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:00.018
IN THEIR OWN DISTRICT EVEN

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.286
THOUGH THEY DID NOT APPROVE IT.

00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:03.221
FURTHER THE OVERSIGHT OF THAT

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:04.822
CHARTER IS BY AN ENTITY THAT IS

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:06.591
NOT LOCATED.

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:09.193
IN THEIR DISTRICT AND IN FACT

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.762
MAYBE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY.

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:12.297
THIS LACK OF OVERSIGHT CAN LEAD

00:32:12.363 --> 00:32:13.564
TO POOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT AND

00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:15.066
POOR STUDENT OUTCOMES AND IN

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:16.768
FACT.

00:32:16.834 --> 00:32:18.169
HAS MANY TIMES ACROSS OUR STATE.

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:19.470
OUR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND

00:32:19.537 --> 00:32:20.638
ADMINISTRATORS KNOW THEIR

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:21.906
DISTRICTS AND THEIR STUDENTS

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.908
BEST AND SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:24.742
TO DETERMINE WHICH CHARTERS CAN

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:27.378
BEST SERVE THEIR STUDENTS THEIR

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:28.513
LOCAL STUDENTS.

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:30.581
THIS BILL AUTHORIZES RATHER THAN

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:32.083
REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO APPROVE

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.518
CHARTER PETITIONS.

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:34.719
THIS GIVES LOCAL DISTRICTS THE

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:35.820
SAME AUTHORITY THAT THEY

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:37.789
ORIGINALLY HAD WHEN THE LAW WAS

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:39.524
WRITTEN IN.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.091
NINETEEN NINETY TWO WE MUST

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:41.626
ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:43.528
CONSIDER ANY FISCAL ACADEMIC OR

00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:45.296
FACILITIES IMPACT A CHARTER

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:46.397
SCHOOL MAY HAVE.

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:49.367
A NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:51.169
AND ONCE CHARTERS ARE APPROVED

00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:53.104
THIS BILL REQUIRES AUTHORIZE

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:54.639
RESTRICT SITTER THE FINANCIAL

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:56.274
STABILITY OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:58.042
DURING RENEWAL.

00:32:58.109 --> 00:32:59.911
THIS WILL ALLOW THE AUTHORIZED

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:00.778
TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO A

00:33:00.845 --> 00:33:04.015
PROBLEM BEFORE IT BECOMES AN

00:33:04.082 --> 00:33:05.149
EMERGENCY.

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:06.517
WHEN I CHARTER SUDDENLY CLOSES

00:33:06.584 --> 00:33:09.187
OR SHUT DOWN IT IS DEVASTATING

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:10.088
FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:11.756
AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUST PICK

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:13.391
UP THE PIECES TO MAKE SURE?

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:14.859
THOSE STUDENTS ARE SERVED

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:16.527
EDUCATED.

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:17.895
AN EXAMPLE LAST YEAR IN

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:20.064
SACRAMENTO A CRISIS SITUATION

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:22.100
COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THIS

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.601
DISTRICT HAD LOCAL CONTROL.

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:25.103
THURMOND COLLEGIATE ACADEMY WAS

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:27.305
INITIALLY DENIED BY SAN JUAN

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:29.006

AND TONIGHT AGAIN BY THE

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:31.309
SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF

EDUCATION BECAUSE THEY IDENTIFY

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:36.013
POTENTIAL FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.316
THE SCHOOL WAS APPROVED.

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:40.017
BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:41.386
IT'S WERE NOTIFIED THAT THE

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:42.787

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:45.089
DAY IT CLOSED DUE TO FINANCIAL

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:46.057
PROBLEMS.

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:47.158
THIS SCHOOL CLOSURE LEFT

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:49.761
STUDENTS STRANDED AND IT COULD

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:53.398
HAVE EASILY BEEN AVOIDED.

00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:54.332
APPROVED ON APPEAL.

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.767
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MANY

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.869
STORIES LIKE THIS ACROSS THE

00:33:57.935 --> 00:33:59.604
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.872
THIS BILL REFORM THE APPEAL

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:02.540

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:03.441
THIS.

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:04.742
ARE NOT REPEATED.

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:05.777
THIS BILL GIVES CHARTER

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:08.012
AUTHORIZES THE TOOLS TO HOLD

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.380
CHARTER SCHOOLS MORE ACCOUNTABLE.

00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:10.948
BY ALLOWING THE AUTHORIZED TO

00:34:11.015 --> 00:34:13.518
SHORTEN THE RENEWAL PERIOD. FOR

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:14.786
STRUGGLING SCHOOLS.

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:15.686
FURTHERMORE ANOTHER WAS RIGHT

00:34:15.753 --> 00:34:17.288
NOW IT'S IT'S FIVE YEARS THEY

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:18.890
CAN ACTUALLY.

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:20.892
DESIGNATE A NUMBER UNDER THAT.

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:22.627
OF COURSE BECAUSE FIVE IS JUST

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:23.227
TOO LONG.

00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:24.662
WHEN THEY HAVE FISCAL PROBLEMS

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.898
FURTHER TO ENSURE THAT CHARTER

00:34:26.964 --> 00:34:28.199

THE REQUIRED CREDENTIAL FOR

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:33.704
THEIR ASSIGNMENT.

00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:35.440
ALLOWING CHARTERS TO HIRE AND

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:37.241
TRAIN TEACHERS ONLY HURTS

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:38.142
STUDENTS.

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:39.043
FINALLY.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.077
THE BILL ALLOWS CHARTERS TO

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:41.979

SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.552
CALIFORNIA.

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:50.221
WHEN CHARTERS ARE STRUGGLING

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:51.022
ACADEMICALLY?

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:53.024
I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.692

THIS BILL MAY POTENTIALLY SLOW

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:04.469
THE GROWTH OF NEW CHARTER

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:06.804
SCHOOLS WHY BECAUSE SOME OF THE

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:08.706
NEFARIOUS OPERATORS WILL RECEIVE

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:10.441
MORE SCRUTINY AND POTENTIALLY.

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:11.943

AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE ANY SCHOOL.

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:16.113

GOT STATE FUNDING TOWARDS THAT

02:43:13.717 --> 02:43:15.118
THIS THIS SCHOOL YEAR.

02:43:15.185 --> 02:43:17.354
THERE ARE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THE

02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:19.756
DISTRICT CHARTER DIVIDE THAT IS

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:21.758
SORT OF PERPETUATED IS ACTUALLY

02:43:21.825 --> 02:43:23.293
NOT TRUE IN OAKLAND THERE'S

02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:24.828
RHETORIC AND THERE'S REALITY.

02:43:24.895 --> 02:43:26.396
AND I THINK THERE IS MUCH

02:43:26.463 --> 02:43:29.232
INTEREST IN WORKING ACROSS -- I

02:43:29.299 --> 02:43:30.567
OPENED AT THE CONTROVERSIAL

02:43:30.634 --> 02:43:31.801
LATITUDE HIGH SCHOOL THAT WENT

02:43:31.868 --> 02:43:32.702
TO STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IT

02:43:32.769 --> 02:43:34.304
IS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE

02:43:34.371 --> 02:43:35.872
PROGRAMS IMAGINABLE WHICH IS WHY

02:43:35.939 --> 02:43:37.741
I PUT SO MUCH ENERGY AND OPENING

02:43:37.807 --> 02:43:37.908
IT.

02:43:37.974 --> 02:43:39.676
WE'RE THEIR CREDIT A COMPETENCY

02:43:39.743 --> 02:43:41.511
BASED HIGH SCHOOL MODEL VERY

02:43:41.578 --> 02:43:43.446
INVEST IN WORKING WITH THE

02:43:43.513 --> 02:43:45.015
ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS

02:43:45.081 --> 02:43:46.316
OAKLAND SO WE CAN GET RID OF

02:43:46.383 --> 02:43:47.551
THINGS LIKE CONTINUATION HIGH

02:43:47.617 --> 02:43:48.685
SCHOOLS AND ALTERNATIVE HIGH

02:43:48.752 --> 02:43:49.920
SCHOOLS AND MOVE TOWARDS.

02:43:49.986 --> 02:43:50.787
IF YOU HAVE A COMPETENCY BASED

02:43:50.854 --> 02:43:52.722
SYSTEM ALL KIDS REGARDLESS OF

02:43:52.789 --> 02:43:54.791
WHETHER THEY'RE UNDER CREDITED

02:43:54.858 --> 02:43:55.959
SIXTEEN CAN ACTUALLY ATTEND HIGH

02:43:56.026 --> 02:43:58.528
SCHOOL AND WORKED QUICKLY OR OR

02:43:58.595 --> 02:44:00.230
THROUGH SUMMERS ARE EVENINGS TO

02:44:00.297 --> 02:44:01.398
ACQUIRE THE COMPANY SEES TO GET

02:44:01.464 --> 02:44:02.599
A FOUR YEAR DEGREE THOSE ARE THE

02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:04.134
KINDS OF INNOVATIONS WERE

02:44:04.201 --> 02:44:04.701
LOOKING.

02:44:04.768 --> 02:44:05.835
FOR AND SPEAKING OF INNOVATION I

02:44:05.902 --> 02:44:07.604
THINK WHAT'S TRICKY FOR ME ABOUT

02:44:07.671 --> 02:44:08.238
THE WORD INNOVATION BECAUSE MY

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:09.439
CHARTER NO HE'S NOT PARTICULARLY

02:44:09.506 --> 02:44:10.440
INNOVATIVE.

02:44:10.507 --> 02:44:12.943
BUT I WILL SAY THIS IN FACT ART

02:44:13.009 --> 02:44:13.643
MY TURN OVER HE'S ACTUALLY

02:44:13.710 --> 02:44:15.212
COMPRISED ALMOST ENTIRELY A

02:44:15.278 --> 02:44:16.079
FORMER -- UST SCHOOLS THAT

02:44:16.146 --> 02:44:21.651
CONVERTED TO CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR

02:44:21.718 --> 02:44:23.420
VARIOUS SINCE OVER THE YEARS.

02:44:23.486 --> 02:44:24.354
AND I WILL SAY THIS I THINK ONE

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:25.455
OF THE THINGS THAT OAKLAND NEEDS

02:44:25.522 --> 02:44:26.289
FOR INNOVATION IS.

02:44:26.356 --> 02:44:27.557
BETTER PERFORMANCE FOR BLACK AND

02:44:27.624 --> 02:44:28.258
BROWN KIDS IF THAT'S NOT

02:44:28.325 --> 02:44:29.059
INNOVATIVE IT'S A PROBLEM

02:44:29.125 --> 02:44:30.594
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING INTO IT

02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:31.161
FIFTY SIXTY YEARS OF UNDER

02:44:31.228 --> 02:44:32.963
PERFORMANCE. FOR BLACK AND BROWN

02:44:33.029 --> 02:44:34.030
KIDS IN THE DEFAULT PUBLIC

02:44:34.097 --> 02:44:35.565
SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT'S THE STATUS

02:44:35.632 --> 02:44:39.269
QUO AND SO IT IS DISRUPTIVE TO

02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:40.370
ACTUALLY HAVE HIGH PERFORMING

02:44:40.437 --> 02:44:41.705
BLACK AND BROWN KIDS IN OAKLAND

02:44:41.771 --> 02:44:43.206
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

02:44:43.273 --> 02:44:44.374
AND I UNDERSTAND HERS AREN'T

02:44:44.441 --> 02:44:45.575
ALWAYS THE ANSWER IN FACT THERE

02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:47.477
ARE BAD PLAYERS AND WE ARE VERY

02:44:47.544 --> 02:44:50.547
OPEN TO GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:44:50.614 --> 02:44:52.115
WE HAVE A VERY STRONG AUTHORIZED

02:44:52.182 --> 02:44:53.383
AN OPEN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:54.985
THEY ARE TOUGH AUTHORIZED -- ARE

02:44:55.051 --> 02:44:56.219
COUNTIES A TOUGH AUTHORIZED --

02:44:56.286 --> 02:44:58.054
AUTHORIZING PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN

02:44:58.121 --> 02:44:59.889
ACCOUNTABILITY -- IT'S A TOUGH

02:44:59.956 --> 02:45:01.258
PLACE TO RUN A CHARTER SCHOOL IF

02:45:01.324 --> 02:45:02.926
YOU'RE NOT A GOOD PLAYER.

02:45:02.993 --> 02:45:04.461
AND I WILL SAY THIS I THINK THE

02:45:04.527 --> 02:45:06.363
CLOSING DOORS TO POTENTIALLY

02:45:06.429 --> 02:45:07.897
INCREASING OUTCOMES FOR KIDS

02:45:07.964 --> 02:45:09.933
WE'VE NOT SEEN OUTCOMES FOR

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.135
DECADES WORRIES ME IT MIGHT NOT

02:45:12.202 --> 02:45:14.204
BE INNOVATIVE IN IN TERMS OF

02:45:14.271 --> 02:45:15.739
LIKE ENGINEERING OR STEM.

02:45:15.805 --> 02:45:17.374
BUT IT'S AND IT'S TRULY INNOVATE

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:22.612
IN TERMS OF LIKE KIDS AND AND

02:45:22.679 --> 02:45:23.146
COMMUNITIES IN OAKLYN ARE

02:45:23.213 --> 02:45:25.982
EXPERIENCING.

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:32.055
I WOULD ONLY GOT A GAME -- DO WE

02:45:32.122 --> 02:45:34.391
HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER.

02:45:34.457 --> 02:45:35.725
IN OTHER NO AND CONNECT YOU

02:45:36.993 --> 02:45:39.496
NUMBER OKAY.

02:45:39.562 --> 02:45:43.166
NO ONE DOWN THERE MISS SMITH.

02:45:43.233 --> 02:45:43.867

02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:09.926
DIVERSIFIED BUT SPECIFIC NEEDS.

02:46:09.993 --> 02:46:11.695
AND SO MY HOPE AS SOMEBODY WHO'S

02:46:11.761 --> 02:46:12.929
BEEN A GOVERNING BOARD MEMBER

02:46:12.996 --> 02:46:14.864
AND WHO KNOWS THE SIGNIFICANCE

02:46:14.931 --> 02:46:16.266
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT KIND

02:46:16.333 --> 02:46:17.901
OF RELATIONSHIP IN ESTABLISHING

02:46:17.967 --> 02:46:19.135
WHAT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT

02:46:19.202 --> 02:46:20.170
INTENDED.

02:46:20.236 --> 02:46:22.839
WHICH WAS DRIVING INNOVATION.

02:46:22.906 --> 02:46:24.107
ELIMINATING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP

02:46:24.174 --> 02:46:26.109
AND FOCUSING ON STUDENT SUCCESS

02:46:26.176 --> 02:46:27.143
THAT THE CLOSER THAT

02:46:27.210 --> 02:46:29.012
RELATIONSHIP IS AND THE MORE

02:46:29.079 --> 02:46:30.313
THAT WE TAKE OUT THE HIGHER

02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:31.881
INSTITUTIONS OF APPROVAL LIKE

02:46:31.948 --> 02:46:32.916
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION

02:46:32.982 --> 02:46:34.818
THAT REALLY HAS NO RELATIONSHIP

02:46:34.884 --> 02:46:36.052
TO THAT LOCAL DYNAMIC.

02:46:36.119 --> 02:46:38.254
THE BETTER OFF STUDENT SUCCESS

02:46:38.321 --> 02:46:39.923
IS GOING TO BE ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:46:39.989 --> 02:46:41.024
SO I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS

02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:42.692
MEASURE TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:46:42.759 --> 02:46:44.928
FUTURE WORK THAT WE MAY DO AFTER

02:46:44.994 --> 02:46:45.895
THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE IS

02:46:45.962 --> 02:46:47.664
DONE AND WRAPS UP AND GIVES US A

02:46:47.731 --> 02:46:49.165
REPORT ON WHAT THEY THINK MIGHT

02:46:49.232 --> 02:46:49.632
FURTHER IMPROVE THIS

02:46:49.699 --> 02:46:50.567
RELATIONSHIP.

02:46:50.633 --> 02:46:51.434
BUT I THINK I'VE BEEN PRETTY

02:46:51.501 --> 02:46:53.036
CLEAR WITH EVERYBODY ALL ALONG

02:46:53.103 --> 02:46:54.537
FROM MY OWNCOMMUNITY TO THE

02:46:54.604 --> 02:46:55.605
FOLKS ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT

02:46:55.672 --> 02:46:57.474
WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS GETTING

02:46:57.540 --> 02:46:58.975
BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT.

02:46:59.042 --> 02:47:00.477
OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL MOVEMENT.

02:47:00.543 --> 02:47:02.512
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED

02:47:02.579 --> 02:47:04.214
ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND I

02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:05.615
WANT EVERYBODY OUT OF THEIR

02:47:05.682 --> 02:47:07.684
SILOS AND TO STOP THROWING BOMBS

02:47:07.751 --> 02:47:09.085
FROM OTHER SIDES OF THE AISLE

02:47:09.152 --> 02:47:10.754
AND FOCUS ON WHAT THAT

02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:12.122
MEANINGFUL WORK IS ABOUT.

02:47:12.188 --> 02:47:13.623
REGARDLESS OF THE KIND OF

02:47:13.690 --> 02:47:14.991
NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL AND THE KIND

02:47:15.058 --> 02:47:16.426
OF PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT THEY ARE

02:47:16.493 --> 02:47:21.231
SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND

02:47:21.297 --> 02:47:22.499
CONSIDERATION ON THAT THANK YOU.

02:47:22.565 --> 02:47:24.300
THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER

02:47:24.367 --> 02:47:25.468
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT

02:47:25.535 --> 02:47:26.536
WAS TO SPEAK DOCTOR WEBER GOING.

02:47:26.603 --> 02:47:27.670
YES OF I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL

02:47:27.737 --> 02:47:30.306
THANK -- MY COLLEAGUES WHO.

02:47:30.373 --> 02:47:31.241
BROUGHT THIS FORWARD I REALIZE

02:47:31.307 --> 02:47:31.408
IT.

02:47:31.474 --> 02:47:32.409
IS THAT YOUR HEART IN THE RIGHT

02:47:32.475 --> 02:47:33.576
PLACE AND SO I DON'T THINK

02:47:33.643 --> 02:47:35.545
THAT'S A PART OF IT ANY

02:47:35.612 --> 02:47:39.015
MALICIOUS OR PLATEN PLAN AGAINST

02:47:39.082 --> 02:47:39.549
I HOPE NOT AGAINST CHARTER

02:47:39.616 --> 02:47:40.383
SCHOOLS.

02:47:40.450 --> 02:47:42.585
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW I I JUDGE

02:47:42.652 --> 02:47:45.021
EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN -- ON

02:47:45.088 --> 02:47:45.855
ITS MERIT IN WHERE THE NOT IT'S

02:47:45.922 --> 02:47:48.091
BENEFICIAL TO CHILDREN.

02:47:48.158 --> 02:47:49.692
AND CLEARLY IT BRINGS ME GREAT

02:47:49.759 --> 02:47:50.994
CONCERN TO SEE THE SIGNIFICANT

02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:52.962
NUMBER OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE

02:47:53.029 --> 02:47:54.864
HERE TALKING ABOUT WANTING

02:47:54.931 --> 02:47:56.399
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND FOR

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:58.568
THEIR CHILDREN -- ESPECIALLY IN

02:47:58.635 --> 02:47:59.636
LIGHT OF WHAT WE KNOW.

02:47:59.702 --> 02:48:01.471
GENERALLY HAPPENS IN MANY PUBLIC

02:48:01.538 --> 02:48:03.873
SCHOOLS WITH REGARDS TO BLACK

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:05.475
AND BROWN KIDS WILL POUR -- HAVE

02:48:05.542 --> 02:48:06.643
BEEN UNDERSERVED ANDAND IT'S

02:48:06.709 --> 02:48:08.411
UNFORTUNATE THAT THE CRITICAL

02:48:08.478 --> 02:48:13.716
QUESTION IS NOT BEING ASKING IS

02:48:13.783 --> 02:48:14.684
WHAT IS BEST FOR CHILDREN.

02:48:14.751 --> 02:48:15.385
I THINK WE CAN IDENTIFY THE

02:48:15.452 --> 02:48:16.619
ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

02:48:16.686 --> 02:48:19.255
CREATED FOR OURSELVES -- THE MAY

02:48:19.322 --> 02:48:21.291
OR MAY NOT HAVE SOME VALIDITY --

02:48:21.357 --> 02:48:22.826
I AM CONCERNED AND I EXPRESSED

02:48:22.892 --> 02:48:24.828
TO SOME OF THE AUTHORS OF THAT --

02:48:24.894 --> 02:48:26.830
I'M THAT PRETTY MUCH THIS THIS

02:48:26.896 --> 02:48:28.097
THIS DISCUSSION TODAY IS A DONE

02:48:28.164 --> 02:48:29.933
DEAL BECAUSE FOUR OF THE SIX

02:48:29.999 --> 02:48:31.134
MEMBERS ON THIS.

02:48:31.201 --> 02:48:32.936
ON THE DAY AS OUR CO AUTHORS OF

02:48:33.002 --> 02:48:34.838
OF THIS BILL SELF OF THIS BILL

02:48:34.904 --> 02:48:35.472
AND ALL THE OTHER CHARTER BILL

02:48:35.538 --> 02:48:35.872
SELF.

02:48:35.939 --> 02:48:36.973
BUT IT'S GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:38.475
ANYWAY SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE

02:48:38.541 --> 02:48:39.709
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF ROOM FOR

02:48:39.776 --> 02:48:42.879
PERSUASION BUT SIMPLY LET ME SAY

02:48:42.946 --> 02:48:45.315
THAT -- I AM CONCERNED THAT THE

02:48:45.381 --> 02:48:46.683
GOVERNOR.

02:48:46.749 --> 02:48:47.917
AND THE SUPERINTENDENT HAVE

02:48:47.984 --> 02:48:49.519
FORMED A TASK FORCE.

02:48:49.586 --> 02:48:51.454
WHOSE TASK IS TO ANSWER SOME OF

02:48:51.521 --> 02:48:51.921
THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:48:51.988 --> 02:48:53.490
AUTHORIZATION.

02:48:53.556 --> 02:48:54.657
YOU WHERE SHOULD BE HOPEFULLY

02:48:54.724 --> 02:48:55.959
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT SHOULD BE IN

02:48:56.025 --> 02:48:58.027
THERE AND EVEN NOW MORE RECENTLY

02:48:58.094 --> 02:49:00.530
THE IMPACT ECONOMICS HAS ON THE

02:49:00.597 --> 02:49:03.466
CHART OF SYSTEM -- I JUST LOOKED

02:49:03.533 --> 02:49:05.201
AT AND OF A LETTER FROM THE

02:49:05.268 --> 02:49:07.203
STATE SUPERINTENDENT ABOUT THE

02:49:07.270 --> 02:49:08.972
MEETINGS A PAD AND THE GOAL THAT

02:49:09.038 --> 02:49:10.640
THEY HAVE TO RELEASE THE REPORT

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:11.574
BY JULY.

02:49:11.641 --> 02:49:13.510
ONE SO I'M CONCERNED THAT I

02:49:13.576 --> 02:49:14.777
DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION.

02:49:14.844 --> 02:49:16.813
NOT UNBIASED INFORMATION ABOUT

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:18.815
WHAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ACTUALLY DO

02:49:18.882 --> 02:49:21.217
AND THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON OUR

02:49:21.284 --> 02:49:21.484
SCHOOLS.

02:49:21.551 --> 02:49:23.620
NOW IS NO QUESTION THAT AFTER

02:49:23.686 --> 02:49:25.021
TWENTY SIX YEARS -- THERE'S A

02:49:25.088 --> 02:49:27.857
NEED FOR A SERIOUS DISCUSSION

02:49:27.924 --> 02:49:29.926
ABOUT CHARTERS IN CALIFORNIA.

02:49:29.993 --> 02:49:31.528
AND OVERSIGHT OF CHARTERS -- AND

02:49:31.594 --> 02:49:32.929
WHAT IS REASONABLE FOR A

02:49:32.996 --> 02:49:34.264
DISTRICT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF

02:49:34.330 --> 02:49:35.598
CHARTERS IS REASONABLE FOR

02:49:35.665 --> 02:49:37.534
DISTRICT THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY

02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:39.202
MANAGE AND SUPERVISE.

02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:41.371
THE WHAT WE'RE GETTING READY TO

02:49:41.437 --> 02:49:42.572
DO WITH THAT AND SOME OTHER

02:49:42.639 --> 02:49:43.473
BILLS WOULD WITH TAX AND THIS

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:44.908
AND THIS DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS

02:49:44.974 --> 02:49:45.108
THAT.

02:49:45.174 --> 02:49:46.242
BECAUSE OF OAKLAND IS ONE THIRD

02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:48.311
CHARTER IS THAT A REASONABLE

02:49:48.378 --> 02:49:49.946
PERCENTAGE FOR THE FOR THE

02:49:50.013 --> 02:49:51.948
ADMINISTRATION OF THAT DISTRICT

02:49:52.015 --> 02:49:54.551
ACTUALLY SUPERVISE THAT NUMBER

02:49:54.617 --> 02:49:55.418
SINCE YOU'RE CAPPING IT AT THAT

02:49:55.485 --> 02:49:56.786
THOUGH STILL BE A 30%.

02:49:56.853 --> 02:49:57.987
AND SO THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES

02:49:58.054 --> 02:49:59.589
IS THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

02:49:59.656 --> 02:50:01.090
THAT WE HAVE FOR CHART IS NOT

02:50:01.157 --> 02:50:02.892
ONLY TO BE OPERATED BY A BOARD

02:50:02.959 --> 02:50:05.161
THAT HAS GOOD OVERSIGHT IS THAT

02:50:05.228 --> 02:50:05.695
ENOUGH.

02:50:05.762 --> 02:50:07.430
AND WHAT IMPACT DOES THAT HAVE

02:50:07.497 --> 02:50:08.231
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:50:08.298 --> 02:50:10.066
OVERSIGHT AND WE SEEN THAT IN

02:50:10.133 --> 02:50:11.834
OTHER PLACES WHAT HAPPENS TO

02:50:11.901 --> 02:50:13.202
BOARDS THAT ARE BAD ACTORS.

02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:15.238
WHO ACTUALLY MAKE LOTS OF

02:50:15.305 --> 02:50:17.440
CHARTERS AND DO NO OVERSIGHT YOU

02:50:17.507 --> 02:50:19.309
KNOW DO WE TAKE AWAY THEIR RIGHT

02:50:19.375 --> 02:50:19.943
TO CHART I MEAN I THINK THERE'S

02:50:20.009 --> 02:50:21.744
SOME REALLY SERIOUS QUESTIONS

02:50:21.811 --> 02:50:23.947
THAT WE NEED TO ASK THIS NOT?

02:50:24.013 --> 02:50:25.114
BEING ASKED AND SERVE OTHER

02:50:25.181 --> 02:50:26.382
LEGISLATION THAT WE SEE THIS

02:50:26.449 --> 02:50:28.685
COMING FOR I'VE HEARD THE RUMORS

02:50:28.751 --> 02:50:31.054
I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE SAY I'VE

02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:31.387
LOOKED AT IT.

02:50:31.454 --> 02:50:33.790
AND THEN I KNOW THE TRANSPARENCY

02:50:33.856 --> 02:50:36.359
POLICE IS GOOD AND WE WE BOTH

02:50:36.426 --> 02:50:36.926
GREASE FOLKS GREAT TO THAT.

02:50:36.993 --> 02:50:37.961
BUT I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT THAT

02:50:38.027 --> 02:50:39.128
THE REAL ISSUES AFFECTING

02:50:39.195 --> 02:50:40.730
CHARTERS AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS

02:50:40.797 --> 02:50:43.266
IN THE STATE ARE NOT REALLY

02:50:43.333 --> 02:50:44.200
BEING ANSWER.

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:46.402
NOW MY YOU KNOW MY INVOLVEMENT

02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:47.170
WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS WAY BACK

02:50:47.236 --> 02:50:48.571
PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYBODY IN

02:50:48.638 --> 02:50:49.939
THIS ROLE.

02:50:50.006 --> 02:50:59.616
BECAUSE I WAS CHAIR OF THE NO

02:50:59.682 --> 02:51:01.918
ONE ONE SEVENTY FOUR CAMPAIGN IN

02:51:01.985 --> 02:51:02.485
NINETEEN NINETY THREE I WAS

02:51:02.552 --> 02:51:03.620
CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

02:51:03.686 --> 02:51:04.487
AND I'VE FOUGHT AGAINST VOUCHERS.

02:51:04.554 --> 02:51:05.221
AND I KNOW THAT A PART OF THE

02:51:05.288 --> 02:51:07.724
NEGOTIATION OUT OF THAT CAME

02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:07.957
CHARTER.

02:51:08.024 --> 02:51:08.591
WHICH IS FINE AND AND THE WHOLE

02:51:08.658 --> 02:51:09.926
IDEA OF SHARING INFORMATION AND

02:51:09.993 --> 02:51:10.560
ALL THAT OTHER STUFF AND WE'VE

02:51:10.627 --> 02:51:12.295
GONE COMPLETELY IN A DIFFERENT

02:51:12.362 --> 02:51:14.063
DIRECTION IT SEEMS AS IF THE YOU

02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:14.831
KNOW THAT MOST OF THE

02:51:14.897 --> 02:51:15.665
CONVERSATION HAS NOT BEEN.

02:51:15.732 --> 02:51:16.866
FRIENDLY SUPPORTIVE

02:51:16.933 --> 02:51:18.534
CONVERSATIONS EVEN THOUGH I KNOW

02:51:18.601 --> 02:51:20.303
THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL BOARDS AND

02:51:20.370 --> 02:51:21.771
A SAN DIEGO SOMEONE THAT

02:51:21.838 --> 02:51:23.139
ACTUALLY WORKS WITH CHARTERS.

02:51:23.206 --> 02:51:25.008
AND HAS DONE SOME GOOD WORK WITH

02:51:25.074 --> 02:51:26.609
CHARTERS AND AND AUTHORIZES

02:51:26.676 --> 02:51:27.844
REASONABLE CHARTERS BUT I KNOW

02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:29.312
THAT RUMORS AND ALL KINDS OF

02:51:29.379 --> 02:51:30.647
THINGS AND YET I DON'T REALLY

02:51:30.713 --> 02:51:31.781
NECESSARILY SEE THIS BEING

02:51:31.848 --> 02:51:33.049
ADDRESSED HERE.

02:51:33.116 --> 02:51:34.450
THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED AND

02:51:34.517 --> 02:51:36.519
IT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED IN

02:51:36.586 --> 02:51:37.854
TERMS OF WHAT WHAT HOW AS WE

02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:38.688
MOVE FORWARD.

02:51:38.755 --> 02:51:40.523
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT --

02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:42.191
AND WHETHER NOT WAS THE ECONOMIC

02:51:42.258 --> 02:51:43.693
ISSUES REGARDING CHART IS WHAT

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:45.094
THIS WAS THE REAL ECONOMIC ISSUE

02:51:45.161 --> 02:51:46.629
WHAT'S A REASONABLE NUMBER OF

02:51:46.696 --> 02:51:48.031
CHARTERS THAT SHOULD EXIST IN

02:51:48.097 --> 02:51:49.666
RELATIONSHIP TO THE SIZE OF THE

02:51:49.732 --> 02:51:50.466
DISTRICT.

02:51:50.533 --> 02:51:52.168
I MEAN THESE ARE SOME IMPORTANT

02:51:52.235 --> 02:51:54.837
ISSUES THAT TO ME STILL ARE NOT

02:51:54.904 --> 02:51:56.839
ADDRESSED AND AND SO WHEN I SAW

02:51:56.906 --> 02:51:59.442
THE THREE BILLS COME FORWARD.

02:52:00.576 --> 02:52:01.911
FROM THIS COMMITTEE I BASICALLY

02:52:01.978 --> 02:52:03.079
SAID WAS A DONE DEAL.

02:52:03.146 --> 02:52:04.580
YOU KNOW IT'S A DONE DEAL THAT

02:52:04.647 --> 02:52:06.783
THIS IS THE DECISION THEY MADE

02:52:06.849 --> 02:52:07.450
AND THAT MY COLLEAGUES IN MAY TO

02:52:07.517 --> 02:52:08.451
MOVE FORWARD WITH I THINK GREAT

02:52:08.518 --> 02:52:09.652
INTENTIONS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT

02:52:09.719 --> 02:52:10.753
OF DISCUSSION.

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:12.922
AROUND CHARTERS AND MANY OF YOU

02:52:12.989 --> 02:52:14.524
AS PARENTS HAVE -- YOU DON'T

02:52:14.590 --> 02:52:15.925
HAVE EXPRESSED THAT INTEREST BUT

02:52:15.992 --> 02:52:17.727
I'D STILL ASK THE QUESTION AND I

02:52:17.794 --> 02:52:18.795
WILL CONTINUE TO ASK A QUESTION

02:52:18.861 --> 02:52:19.996
WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS.

02:52:20.063 --> 02:52:26.769
AND WHY DO SO MANY PARENTS FEEL

02:52:26.836 --> 02:52:29.939
SOUL DESPERATE. FOR A CHARTER.

02:52:30.006 --> 02:52:30.573
YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND THIS TO BE

02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:31.207
TRUE THAT THEY SEE THIS IS THE

02:52:31.274 --> 02:52:32.208
ONLY HOPE THEY HAVE THE ONLY

02:52:32.275 --> 02:52:33.409
ANSWER THEY HAVE A MEET AND I

02:52:33.476 --> 02:52:35.111
HEAR THIS REGULARLY FROM PARENTS.

02:52:35.178 --> 02:52:36.279
AND WHAT I SHARED A DON'T SHARE

02:52:36.345 --> 02:52:36.879
THEIR THEIR VIEW OF THAT THE

02:52:36.946 --> 02:52:38.281
REALITY IS WE HAVE TO ASK

02:52:38.347 --> 02:52:39.515
OURSELVES THE QUESTION.

02:52:39.582 --> 02:52:40.883
WHY IS IT THAT THERE'S SUCH A

02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:42.919
TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN CIARA'S

02:52:42.985 --> 02:52:43.886
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC

02:52:43.953 --> 02:52:45.221
PIECE AND THERE'S SOME BAD

02:52:45.288 --> 02:52:47.090
ACTORS OUT THERE THAT ARE MAKING

02:52:47.156 --> 02:52:49.225
A BUNDLE ON CHARTERS AND THEN

02:52:49.292 --> 02:52:49.792
GETTING UP THE BUSINESS OF

02:52:49.859 --> 02:52:50.827
WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING?

02:52:50.893 --> 02:52:51.694
BUT WE STILL HAVE TO ASK THE

02:52:51.761 --> 02:52:53.362
QUESTION WHY ARE FOLKS SO

02:52:53.429 --> 02:52:55.298
WILLING TO DO CHARTERS WE LIVE

SCHOOL ALL RIGHT DOWN THE STREET

02:52:57.633 --> 02:52:59.268
FROM A PUBLIC SCHOOL AND THEY

WANT TO GO TO A CHARTER.

02:53:00.603 --> 02:53:02.138
YOU KNOW AND SO I I THINK

02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:03.372

GOING TO STAY OFF OF IT.

02:53:21.390 --> 02:53:23.659
ABOUT WHAT IS BEST -- WITH

02:57:32.241 --> 02:57:34.210
AND WE HAVE A VARIETY UNDER --

02:57:34.276 --> 02:57:36.145
FINANCIAL DURESS AND I THINK IT

02:57:36.212 --> 02:57:38.247
IS A VALID QUESTION SHOULD NOT

02:57:38.314 --> 02:57:39.415
AT ALL.

02:57:39.482 --> 02:57:41.017
THE THE ONLY QUESTION IS ASKED

02:57:41.083 --> 02:57:43.019
UPON APPROVAL BUT IT IS A VALID

02:57:43.085 --> 02:57:44.687
QUESTION TO ASK.

02:57:44.754 --> 02:57:46.722
IF THAT IS -- FINANCIALLY

02:57:46.789 --> 02:57:48.958
IMPACTFUL AND IN FACT CAN THE

02:57:49.025 --> 02:57:51.127
CHARTER.

02:57:51.193 --> 02:57:53.262
BE SUSTAIN FINANCIALLY.

02:57:53.329 --> 02:57:53.896
TO OKAY I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR

02:57:53.963 --> 02:57:54.563
YOU SAID THAT IF YOU'RE A GOOD

02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:55.865
CHARTER OPERATOR YOU HAVE

02:57:55.931 --> 02:57:57.733
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

02:57:57.800 --> 02:57:58.667
BUT YOU KNOW SOMEONE OR OFTEN

02:57:58.734 --> 02:58:00.369
THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU WANT OPEN

02:58:00.436 --> 02:58:02.171
ANOTHER SCHOOL DOING PROVIDE

02:58:02.238 --> 02:58:03.072
OPPORTUNITY TO MORE KIDS.

02:58:03.139 --> 02:58:04.373
YOU WOULD HAVE A FACTOR OTHER

02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:05.975
THAN THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT

02:58:06.042 --> 02:58:07.777
AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT

02:58:07.843 --> 02:58:08.978
SCHOOL BE ROB IS THAT RIGHT.

02:58:09.045 --> 02:58:11.380
WELL YOU WOULD.

02:58:11.447 --> 02:58:12.348
IT'S A FIGHT AT THE FINANCIAL

02:58:12.415 --> 02:58:13.816
QUESTION WOULD BE ON PAR WITH

02:58:13.883 --> 02:58:15.651
THE OTHERS WHICH I THINK IT'S

02:58:15.718 --> 02:58:18.788
IT'S A VALID QUESTION ACT ASK.

02:58:18.854 --> 02:58:19.822
IT IS VALID TO ASK WHAT

02:58:19.889 --> 02:58:21.690
FINANCIAL IMPACT A NEW SCHOOL

02:58:21.757 --> 02:58:22.258
WOULD HAVE.

02:58:22.324 --> 02:58:23.759
AS FAR AS THAT STREET SCHOOL

02:58:23.826 --> 02:58:26.262
BEING ABLE TO BE SUSTAINED OR

02:58:26.328 --> 02:58:29.632
ITS IMPACT ON OTHER SCHOOLS.

02:58:29.698 --> 02:58:31.333
WHAT -- I MEAN HOW WOULD.

02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:33.269
HOW WOULD YOU ESTABLISH THIS --

02:58:33.335 --> 02:58:35.938
YOU KNOW THE NEW FACTOR IS.

02:58:36.005 --> 02:58:37.640
NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE

02:58:37.706 --> 02:58:39.909
DISTRICT -- WHAT EVIDENCE WOULD

02:58:39.975 --> 02:58:40.943
YOU HAVE TO SHOW TO SUBSTANTIATE

02:58:41.010 --> 02:58:41.577
THAT THERE BE A NEGATIVE

02:58:41.644 --> 02:58:42.812
FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE DISTRICT

02:58:42.878 --> 02:58:44.880
UNDER THIS BILL?

02:58:44.947 --> 02:58:46.015
WELL I'M SURE THERE WOULD BE AN

02:58:46.082 --> 02:58:48.984
APPLICATION PROCESS WHERE THAT

02:58:49.051 --> 02:58:50.352
INFORMATION WOULD BE ASCERTAINED

02:58:50.419 --> 02:58:51.754
SO EVEN IF IT'S A VERY MINOR

02:58:51.821 --> 02:58:53.355
NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE

02:58:53.422 --> 02:58:55.024
DISTRICT WOULD IT COULD A

02:58:55.091 --> 02:58:57.927
CHARTER BE DENIED ON THAT BASIS.

02:58:57.993 --> 02:58:59.728
I WOULD THINK -- BOARD WOULD

02:58:59.795 --> 02:59:02.031
TAKE THE SITUATION IN TOTALITY

02:59:02.098 --> 02:59:04.266
AND MAKE AN ACTION BASED ON THE

02:59:04.333 --> 02:59:05.167
INFORMATION THEY'VE BEEN

02:59:05.234 --> 02:59:06.869
PROVIDED BUT IT WOULD BE LAWFUL

02:59:06.936 --> 02:59:08.637
FOR A BOARD TO DENY CHARTER ON

02:59:08.704 --> 02:59:09.738
THE BASIS OF A NEGATIVE.

02:59:09.805 --> 02:59:11.507
EVEN A MINOR NEGATIVE FINANCIAL

02:59:11.574 --> 02:59:14.043
IMPACT ON THE DOESN'T THAT RIGHT

02:59:14.110 --> 02:59:15.177
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE

02:59:15.244 --> 02:59:15.478
[inaudible]

02:59:15.544 --> 02:59:17.513
AND AGAIN.

02:59:17.580 --> 02:59:19.915
I'M NOT ON THE LOCAL BOARD.

02:59:19.982 --> 02:59:21.350
OKAY BUT I FOR ASK ABOUT THE LAW

02:59:21.417 --> 02:59:22.685
THAT YOU'RE SEEKING TO MAKE THE

02:59:22.751 --> 02:59:24.620
GOVERNOR'S THESE THINGS AND WHAT

02:59:24.687 --> 02:59:26.388
WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IS. THREE

02:59:26.455 --> 02:59:28.090
CHART RETURN THOSE DECISIONS THE

02:59:28.157 --> 02:59:30.893
LOCAL LEVEL BASED ON A VARIETY

02:59:30.960 --> 02:59:32.761
OF FACTORS.

02:59:32.828 --> 02:59:34.196
WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SO

02:59:34.263 --> 02:59:35.731
YOU YOU SAID YOU WANT TO RETURN

02:59:35.798 --> 02:59:37.099
DECISIONS TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND

02:59:37.166 --> 02:59:39.401
I THINK YOU TALKED ABOUT.

02:59:39.468 --> 02:59:40.336
WHAT AUTHORIZES SHOPPING WAS AT

02:59:40.402 --> 02:59:40.936
THE TERM?

02:59:41.003 --> 02:59:42.705
AND YOU MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT

02:59:42.771 --> 02:59:43.639
THERE IS.

02:59:43.706 --> 02:59:44.840
GREATER DEMOCRATIC

02:59:44.907 --> 02:59:46.942
ACCOUNTABILITY -- WITHIN THE

02:59:47.009 --> 02:59:48.878
AUTHORIZED -- WHEN THAT WHEN

02:59:48.944 --> 02:59:50.312
THAT CHARTER IS WITHIN THE

02:59:50.379 --> 02:59:52.448
BOUNDARIES OF THE AUTHORIZES

02:59:52.515 --> 02:59:54.116
SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS A ARGUMENT?

02:59:54.183 --> 02:59:55.417
YES YEAH WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A

02:59:55.484 --> 02:59:56.552
SITUATION WHERE.

02:59:56.619 --> 02:59:58.554
CHARTERS ARE BEING AUTHORIZED

02:59:58.621 --> 03:00:01.323
FAR AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL

03:00:01.390 --> 03:00:01.891
DISTRICT THEY MAY SIT IN.

03:00:01.957 --> 03:00:02.925
AND THERE IS LITTLE TO NO

03:00:02.992 --> 03:00:04.827
OVERSIGHT OF THESE CHAR'S WHAT

03:00:04.894 --> 03:00:05.661
WE FOUND AYE AYE TO I TALKED

03:00:05.728 --> 03:00:06.662
ABOUT THE ARTICLES WE HAVE

03:00:06.729 --> 03:00:07.830
PEOPLE MAKING LOTS OF MONEY OFF

03:00:07.897 --> 03:00:08.864
THESE CHARTERS.

03:00:08.931 --> 03:00:10.366
KIDS NOT BEING SERVED WELL AND

03:00:10.432 --> 03:00:11.934
IT TURNS OUT TO BE A RATHER

03:00:12.001 --> 03:00:14.670
UNFORTUNATE SITUATION FOR THE

03:00:14.737 --> 03:00:16.138
STUDENTS.

03:00:16.205 --> 03:00:18.707
AND AND AND AND THE THE THE

03:00:18.774 --> 03:00:19.942
AUTHORIZED.

03:00:20.009 --> 03:00:20.776
FOR SO WHAT ABOUT COUNTS THAT

03:00:20.843 --> 03:00:21.777
COUNTIES HAVE DEMOCRATIC

03:00:21.844 --> 03:00:23.445
DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY --

03:00:23.512 --> 03:00:24.880
THEY'RE MORE MEMBERS ARE

03:00:24.947 --> 03:00:26.649
POPULARLY ELECTED -- YET THIS

03:00:26.715 --> 03:00:28.717
BILL SEEKS TO FOR ALL INTENTS

03:00:28.784 --> 03:00:30.386
AND PURPOSES ELIMINATE THE ROLE --

03:00:30.452 --> 03:00:33.022
WHY IS DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY

03:00:33.088 --> 03:00:34.323
NOT GOOD ENOUGH WHEN IT COMES TO

03:00:34.390 --> 03:00:34.790
THE COUNTY?

03:00:34.857 --> 03:00:35.991
BUT WELL FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT

03:00:36.058 --> 03:00:37.259
TOTALLY ELIMINATING THE ROLE BUT

03:00:37.326 --> 03:00:38.561
WE'RE SAYING IS IT SHOULD BE A

03:00:38.627 --> 03:00:39.995
LOCAL DECISION WERE CHAIRED AND

03:00:40.062 --> 03:00:43.365
WERE RETURNING DECISIONS TO

03:00:43.432 --> 03:00:45.534
LOCAL BASIS.

03:00:45.601 --> 03:00:46.902
OKAY SO WHY IS I I'M NOT I DON'T

03:00:46.969 --> 03:00:47.503
KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M A FIRM

03:00:47.570 --> 03:00:48.437
SUPPORTER OF LOCAL CONTROL AND

03:00:48.504 --> 03:00:49.905
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

03:00:49.972 --> 03:00:51.407
IT FALL IT FALLS BACK ON THE

03:00:51.473 --> 03:00:52.541
LOCALS.

03:00:52.608 --> 03:00:53.776
OUR COUNTY IS NOT LOCAL DECISION

03:00:53.842 --> 03:00:57.880
MAKERS.

03:00:57.947 --> 03:00:59.515
THE REGIONAL DECISION MAKERS I

03:00:59.582 --> 03:01:01.016
WOULD SAY THEY'RE VERY MUCH

03:01:01.083 --> 03:01:03.419
LOCAL DECISION OKAY SO WHY IS IT

03:01:03.485 --> 03:01:04.220
THAT.

03:01:04.286 --> 03:01:05.621
I MEAN WHY IS THAT A DISTINCTION

03:01:05.688 --> 03:01:06.889
THAT MATTERS IN THIS CONTEXT.

03:01:06.956 --> 03:01:08.857
YOU TELL ME.

03:01:08.924 --> 03:01:10.059
WELL NOW YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S

03:01:10.125 --> 03:01:11.026
ACTUALLY PUTTING THAT

03:01:11.093 --> 03:01:13.362
DISTINCTION THE LAW SO I THINK

03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:13.963
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WELL IT'S

03:01:14.029 --> 03:01:14.964
IT'S IT'S A GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD

03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:16.031
CONCEPT THAT COUNTIES MAKE

03:01:16.098 --> 03:01:18.601
DECISIONS ON A REGIONAL BASIS.

03:01:18.667 --> 03:01:20.202
AND FOR INSTANCE A SCOLD SCHOOL

03:01:20.269 --> 03:01:21.837
DISTRICT MAKES DECISIONS ON A

03:01:21.904 --> 03:01:24.340
VERY LOCAL -- BASIS ONLY WITHIN

03:01:24.406 --> 03:01:25.941
THE CONFINES.

03:01:26.008 --> 03:01:27.409
OF THAT DISTRICT SO WE'RE

03:01:27.476 --> 03:01:29.378
SEEKING TO DO IS ALLOW THAT

03:01:29.445 --> 03:01:31.046
DISTRICT WHICH MANAGES THAT.

03:01:31.113 --> 03:01:31.847
THAT.

03:01:31.914 --> 03:01:32.648
WITHIN THE CONFINES THAT

03:01:32.715 --> 03:01:33.849
BOUNDARY TO MAKE THE DECISIONS

03:01:33.916 --> 03:01:35.884
NOT TO PASS IT ON TO SOMEONE WHO

03:01:35.951 --> 03:01:36.986
WOULD NOT.

03:01:37.052 --> 03:01:38.887
A REALLY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

03:01:38.954 --> 03:01:40.923
OVERSIGHT ON ON I SEE

03:01:40.990 --> 03:01:42.324
COOPERATION AND A VERY LOCAL

03:01:42.391 --> 03:01:43.559
BASIS UNDERSTAND SOME THESE ARE

03:01:43.626 --> 03:01:45.060
HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY.

03:01:45.127 --> 03:01:46.395
FROM WHERE THE SCHOOL SIT SO

03:01:46.462 --> 03:01:48.497
HE'S AUTHORIZE OR SITS FAR FAR

03:01:48.564 --> 03:01:49.164
AWAY STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO

03:01:49.231 --> 03:01:55.638
TALK HOW FAR AWAY FROM SOME OF

03:01:55.704 --> 03:01:57.840
THESE ARE THAT IS AN ANSWER.

03:01:57.906 --> 03:01:58.807
SEVENTIES SO THESE CHARTER

03:01:58.874 --> 03:02:00.142
SCHOOLS SIT FAR FAR AWAY FROM

03:02:00.209 --> 03:02:00.776
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

03:02:00.843 --> 03:02:02.177
AND THEY'RE JUST IS NOT ADEQUATE

03:02:02.244 --> 03:02:03.078
OVERSIGHT I THINK YOU'VE SEEN

03:02:03.145 --> 03:02:04.013
PEOPLE GOING TO JAIL.

03:02:04.079 --> 03:02:04.546
YOU SEEN CHARTERS CLOSING

03:02:04.613 --> 03:02:05.514
OVERNIGHT YOU SEEN FINANCIAL

03:02:05.581 --> 03:02:07.216
DISASTERS AND I THINK TODAY WE

03:02:07.283 --> 03:02:08.384
NEED TO FIX THAT OKAY I WAS

03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:09.685
TALKING ABOUT COUNTIES SO SOME

03:02:09.752 --> 03:02:11.253
COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY SMALLER

03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:13.555
THAN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- I

03:02:13.622 --> 03:02:15.891
THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN TELL

03:02:15.958 --> 03:02:16.492
YOU WHAT COUNTY THEY LIVE IN A

03:02:16.558 --> 03:02:17.159
LOT OF YOU MIGHT EVEN KNOW WHAT

03:02:17.226 --> 03:02:18.093
SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY HAPPEN TO

03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:19.461
BE AND SO WHY IT.

03:02:19.528 --> 03:02:20.763
IS THAT NOT CONSIDERED A FORM OF

03:02:20.829 --> 03:02:24.533
LOCAL CONTROL BUT SHOULD BE

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:26.068
AVAILABLE FOR CHARTER AUTHORIZED.

03:02:26.135 --> 03:02:27.503
BECAUSE AGAIN WE'RE DOING WHAT

03:02:27.569 --> 03:02:28.270
WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IS RETURN

03:02:28.337 --> 03:02:30.005
THE DECISION OF LOCAL CONTROL A

03:02:30.072 --> 03:02:31.507
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT.

03:02:31.573 --> 03:02:32.574
HAS CONTROL OVER ITS OWN

03:02:32.641 --> 03:02:35.577
BOUNDARIES AND AND AND I SUPPORT

03:02:35.644 --> 03:02:37.346
THAT YOU MAY NOT I DO.

03:02:37.413 --> 03:02:39.381
AT A COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE

03:02:39.448 --> 03:02:42.484
CONTROL OVER ITS OWN BOUNDARIES

03:02:42.551 --> 03:02:42.785
[inaudible]

03:02:42.851 --> 03:02:45.621
I'M SORRY.

03:02:45.688 --> 03:02:47.056
BUT WHATEVER I COUNTY DOES NOT

03:02:47.122 --> 03:02:48.390
HAVE CONTROL OVER ITS OWN

03:02:48.457 --> 03:02:50.926
BOUNDARIES THAT WE'RE SAYING

03:02:50.993 --> 03:02:51.226
[inaudible]

03:02:51.293 --> 03:02:51.994
SURE DOES [inaudible]

03:02:52.061 --> 03:02:54.930
OKAY.

03:02:54.997 --> 03:02:56.965
LET'S GO ON TO A THE PORTION OF

03:02:57.032 --> 03:02:57.900
THIS BILL.

03:02:57.966 --> 03:02:59.902
THAT WOULD ELIMINATE GROWTH IN

03:02:59.968 --> 03:03:01.603
ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AS THE MOST

03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:03.072
IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CHARTER REAL

03:03:03.138 --> 03:03:05.374
WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THAT.

03:03:05.441 --> 03:03:06.408
I'M SORRY ONE MORE TIME WHY DOES

03:03:06.475 --> 03:03:07.042
THE BELL THE MINUTE GROWTH IN

03:03:07.109 --> 03:03:09.011
ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IS THE MOST

03:03:09.078 --> 03:03:09.745
IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CHARTER

03:03:09.812 --> 03:03:11.380
RENEWAL -- DOESN'T IT IT DOES

03:03:11.447 --> 03:03:12.614
NOT.

03:03:12.681 --> 03:03:15.317
IT IS STILL A FACTOR IT IS STILL

03:03:15.384 --> 03:03:16.552
A FACTOR BUT IT'S NO LONGER THE

03:03:16.618 --> 03:03:17.953
PRIMARY FACTOR WHY DO YOU THINK

03:03:18.020 --> 03:03:19.655
THAT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT SHOULD

03:03:19.722 --> 03:03:21.490
NOT BE THE PRIMARY FACTOR.

03:03:21.557 --> 03:03:23.025
WELL IT PUTS IT ON PAR WITH

03:03:23.092 --> 03:03:25.060
OTHER FACTORS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD

03:03:25.127 --> 03:03:25.994
SOME CHARTER THAT ARE VERY

03:03:26.061 --> 03:03:27.262
SUCCESSFUL BUT OUR FINANCIAL

03:03:27.329 --> 03:03:28.964
DISASTERS WE HAVE TO THE TRI

03:03:29.031 --> 03:03:30.833
VALLEY EXAMPLE.

03:03:30.899 --> 03:03:33.068
WHERE IN A CHARTER -- CHARTER

03:03:33.135 --> 03:03:34.403
WENT BANKRUPT WHEN OUT OF

03:03:34.470 --> 03:03:36.438
BUSINESS YET THE THE BUILDING

03:03:36.505 --> 03:03:39.475
THEY BOUGHT WITH PUBLIC MONEY

03:03:39.541 --> 03:03:40.642
ENDED UP IN PRIVATE HANDS.

03:03:40.709 --> 03:03:41.810
THE BUILDING WAS WORTH A LOT OF

03:03:41.877 --> 03:03:43.078
MONEY THE STUDENTS MIGHT HAVE

03:03:43.145 --> 03:03:44.680
BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH THE SCHOOLS

03:03:44.747 --> 03:03:46.014
GOING DOWN THE TUBES FINANCIALLY.

03:03:46.081 --> 03:03:48.851
SO THERE'S A BALANCE TO BE FOUND --

03:03:48.917 --> 03:03:49.985
BUT LISTEN I'M AS A CLASSROOM

03:03:50.052 --> 03:03:52.388
TEACHER I WANT STUDENT SUCCESS I

03:03:52.454 --> 03:03:53.489
WANT OUR STUDENTS TO MOVE

03:03:53.555 --> 03:03:54.423
FORWARD.

03:03:54.490 --> 03:03:58.060
WITH US IF IF CHARTER IS -- IS

03:03:58.127 --> 03:04:00.662
IS IS IS FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED

03:04:00.729 --> 03:04:01.864
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE DO

03:04:01.930 --> 03:04:02.698
NEED TO LOOK I THINK WE HAVE A

03:04:02.765 --> 03:04:03.932
RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY ATTENTION

03:04:03.999 --> 03:04:05.200
THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF ANY

03:04:05.267 --> 03:04:06.535
GOVERNMENTAL OPERATION.

03:04:06.602 --> 03:04:07.936
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU

03:04:08.003 --> 03:04:09.371
MAY NOT YOU MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH

03:04:09.438 --> 03:04:10.839
THAT BUT THAT'S MY PERCEPTION MY

03:04:10.906 --> 03:04:16.111
POSITION.

03:04:16.178 --> 03:04:18.714
THAT'S OFTEN UP.

03:04:18.781 --> 03:04:20.349
THANK YOU -- THAT -- MISTER

03:04:20.416 --> 03:04:21.350
KALRA.

03:04:21.417 --> 03:04:23.619
THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT I REALLY

03:04:23.685 --> 03:04:24.186
PERSON DIALOG.

03:04:24.253 --> 03:04:26.054
PUSH THE DOWN ESPECIALLY AS OF

03:04:26.121 --> 03:04:27.890
LATE SO THE CONVERSATION FROM

03:04:27.956 --> 03:04:28.791
THE CHARTER EXPLICA THERE'S ROOM

03:04:28.857 --> 03:04:30.526
FOR A LOT OF COMMON GROUND AND I

03:04:30.592 --> 03:04:32.528
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT.

03:04:32.594 --> 03:04:33.195
OPTICALLY WITH THE AMENDMENT AND

03:04:33.262 --> 03:04:35.397
THE CLARITY THERE I THINK THAT --

03:04:35.464 --> 03:04:37.466
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT -- IS

03:04:37.533 --> 03:04:38.467
A TAKE AWAY FROM ALL OF US IS

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:40.436
THAT -- NO ONE WANTS ANYONE

03:04:40.502 --> 03:04:41.437
WHETHER IT'S A TRADITIONAL

03:04:41.503 --> 03:04:42.004
PUBLIC SCHOOL OR A CHARTER

03:04:42.070 --> 03:04:44.406
SCHOOL TO BEA POOR PERFORMER I

03:04:44.473 --> 03:04:46.308
I THINK THAT WE WANT TO DO OUR

03:04:46.375 --> 03:04:48.644
BEST UP THAT ALL CHILDREN ALL

03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.911
SCHOOLS.

03:04:48.977 --> 03:04:53.348
AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WITH THE

03:04:53.415 --> 03:04:54.917
THE CLARIFICATION -- THAT'LL BE

03:04:54.983 --> 03:04:55.818
FORTHCOMING THAT THAT HELPS

03:04:55.884 --> 03:04:57.186
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS

03:04:57.252 --> 03:04:59.421
AT LEAST FROM THE SCHOOLSTHAT

03:04:59.488 --> 03:05:00.122
ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN

03:05:00.189 --> 03:05:02.658
OPERATING WELL -- AND IF THERE'S

03:05:02.724 --> 03:05:04.226
FURTHER NEEDS FOR CONVERSATION

03:05:04.293 --> 03:05:05.027
AMENDMENTS WHAT HAVE YOU THE

03:05:05.093 --> 03:05:08.263
DIALOGUE CONTINUES IS THE FIRST

03:05:08.330 --> 03:05:09.832
COMMITTEE HEARING.

03:05:09.898 --> 03:05:11.133
I'VE NEVER YEAH I WOULD I WON

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:12.334
THIS ONE OF MY THIRD YEAR I'VE

03:05:12.401 --> 03:05:12.868
NEVER SEEN A BILL THAT'S

03:05:12.935 --> 03:05:15.337
INTRODUCED THAT ISN'T AMENDED --

03:05:15.404 --> 03:05:17.172
NUMEROUS TIMES AS IT MAKES ITS

03:05:17.239 --> 03:05:18.173
WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE

03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:20.642
PROCESS AND SO -- IT'S REALLY

03:05:20.709 --> 03:05:22.344
REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET FEEDBACK

03:05:22.411 --> 03:05:23.979
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

03:05:24.046 --> 03:05:26.215
AND APPRECIATED EVERYONE THAT

03:05:26.281 --> 03:05:28.050
CAME ON BOTH SIDES TO PROVIDE

03:05:28.116 --> 03:05:29.918
THAT BE BACK -- BECAUSE THAT

03:05:29.985 --> 03:05:32.488
THAT IN ADDITION.

03:05:32.554 --> 03:05:34.022
TO CLEARLY UP SOME OF THE THE

03:05:34.089 --> 03:05:35.557
THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE GREATER

03:05:35.624 --> 03:05:44.233
EXPERTISE -- CONTINUING THE

03:05:44.299 --> 03:05:46.835
DIALOGUE HELPS. NINE TIMES OUT

03:05:46.902 --> 03:05:47.469
OF TEN TO MAKE IT BETTER BILL.

03:05:47.536 --> 03:05:49.004
AND TO IMPROVE ON THE BILL AND

03:05:49.071 --> 03:05:50.472
CREATE CLARITY WHERE IT'S

03:05:50.539 --> 03:05:51.673
NECESSARY AS HAS BEEN SICK --

03:05:51.740 --> 03:05:52.674
DEMONSTRATED BY THE CHAIR.

03:05:52.741 --> 03:05:56.445
AND SO -- I ALSO -- SHE DOCTOR

03:05:56.512 --> 03:05:57.112
WEBER'S COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO

03:05:57.179 --> 03:05:59.348
HAVE SUPPORT OF CONVERSATIONS.

03:05:59.414 --> 03:06:00.382
THAT THE AND THAT'S AND THAT'S A

03:06:00.449 --> 03:06:02.084
A TWO WAY STREET BOTH IN TERMS

03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.818
OF COLLEAGUES DOING ONE OTHER

03:06:02.885 --> 03:06:05.053
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT

03:06:05.120 --> 03:06:05.387
STAKEHOLDERS.

03:06:05.454 --> 03:06:06.522
IS GONNA BE IT OF OF A

03:06:06.588 --> 03:06:07.122
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WERE AT

03:06:07.189 --> 03:06:10.759
LEAST THERE'S UNDERSTANDING THAT --

03:06:10.826 --> 03:06:11.827
THAT.

03:06:11.894 --> 03:06:13.695
THE GOOD THE ULTIMATE GOALS AS

03:06:13.762 --> 03:06:15.531
STATED BY DOCTOR WEBER NEED TO

03:06:15.597 --> 03:06:17.099
BE SIMILAR OR THE SAME HOLE FOR

03:06:17.165 --> 03:06:17.900
THE SAME OR SOMETIMES IT CAN BE

03:06:17.966 --> 03:06:18.600
THE SAME ONLY SIMILAR.

03:06:18.667 --> 03:06:24.940
IN THE SENSE OF ENSURING THAT

03:06:25.007 --> 03:06:26.775
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:06:26.842 --> 03:06:27.576
THE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND

03:06:27.643 --> 03:06:28.143
WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE

03:06:28.210 --> 03:06:29.111
FACT THESE A PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT

03:06:29.177 --> 03:06:29.945
REQUIRED THE SAME KIND OF

03:06:30.012 --> 03:06:30.546
ACCOUNTABILITY THAN ANYTHING

03:06:30.612 --> 03:06:31.914
ELSE THAT IS FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS

03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:32.848
REQUIRES.

03:06:32.915 --> 03:06:34.349
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE IS A

03:06:34.416 --> 03:06:36.618
COMMON GROUND THAT CAN BE HAD

03:06:36.685 --> 03:06:37.753
HERE.

03:06:37.819 --> 03:06:38.987
WE ALSO RARELY SEE BILLS THAT

03:06:39.054 --> 03:06:41.223
HAVE A 100% UNANIMOUS SUPPORT ON

03:06:41.290 --> 03:06:42.791
EVERY ITEM BUT I THINK THAT'S

03:06:42.858 --> 03:06:43.625
SOMETHING THAT.

03:06:43.692 --> 03:06:45.827
THAT I KNOW THE CHAIR OF HIM

03:06:45.894 --> 03:06:47.396
HAVING SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE

03:06:47.462 --> 03:06:49.097
AND SEEN HUNDREDS OF THE HOUSE

03:06:49.164 --> 03:06:50.766
COMPASS ME THE CHAIR ALWAYS.

03:06:50.832 --> 03:06:52.734
TRIES TO STRIVE FOR AN AND BEING

03:06:52.801 --> 03:06:53.936
OBVIOUSLY HAVE A PRIMARY

03:06:54.002 --> 03:06:56.872
AUTHORED THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE

03:06:56.939 --> 03:06:58.407
TO DO SO AND I AND I JUST WANNA

03:06:58.473 --> 03:06:59.708

03:07:03.211 --> 03:07:04.479
VERY SPECIFICALLY MENTION

03:07:04.546 --> 03:07:05.581
REGARDS TO IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT

03:07:05.647 --> 03:07:06.682
ALUM ROCK AND JUST TO MAKE IT

03:07:06.748 --> 03:07:08.250
VERY CLEAR I THINK THAT ANYONE

03:07:08.317 --> 03:07:08.817
HAS PAID ATTENTION DOWN OCT

03:07:08.884 --> 03:07:09.685
KNOWS THAT.

03:07:09.751 --> 03:07:10.719
I CALLED FOR THE AUDIT OF THE

03:07:10.786 --> 03:07:12.120
ALAMO SCHOOL DISTRICT I

03:07:12.187 --> 03:07:13.755
SUPPORTED THE GRAND JURY

03:07:13.822 --> 03:07:15.691
RECOMMENDATION TO THAT THREE OF

03:07:15.757 --> 03:07:18.060
THE BOARD MEMBERS SHOULD RESIGN --

03:07:18.126 --> 03:07:19.895
SINCE THEN TWO OF THE MEMBER OUR

03:07:19.962 --> 03:07:21.897
PLACE TO DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS --

03:07:21.964 --> 03:07:23.165
THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS UNFAIRLY

03:07:23.231 --> 03:07:24.433
TARGETED BY THE PREVIOUS BOARD

03:07:24.499 --> 03:07:25.300
MAJORITY.

03:07:25.367 --> 03:07:28.136
HAD BEEN -- TRYING HER BEST TO

03:07:28.203 --> 03:07:28.704
WORK WITH THE STATE AND THE

03:07:28.770 --> 03:07:30.739

03:07:48.390 --> 03:07:49.958
THAT WE HAVE -- I HOPE -- BUT

03:07:50.025 --> 03:07:51.526

THAT WE NEED TO BE VOLATILE

03:07:58.066 --> 03:07:58.634
BLACKED OUT THE NEED TO AT LEAST

03:07:58.700 --> 03:07:59.134
MENTION THAT.

03:07:59.201 --> 03:07:59.635
IS WAS VERY SPECIFICALLY

BECAUSE I THINK THAT AGAIN THAT

03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:22.924

HEATED FROM THE POLITICS AS A

03:14:51.212 --> 03:14:52.614
PRIOR MEASURE BUT I THINK A BIT

MORE SIMPLE.

03:14:53.848 --> 03:14:55.183

IS A BIT MORE OF A SIMPLE --

03:15:02.090 --> 03:15:03.391
EQUATION I THINK PEOPLE WITH

03:15:03.458 --> 03:15:04.559
WOULD UNDERSTAND.

03:15:04.626 --> 03:15:06.027
THIS MEASURE WOULD ESTABLISH A

03:15:06.094 --> 03:15:07.562
CAP ON THE NUMBER OF CHARTER

03:15:07.629 --> 03:15:09.130
SCHOOLS OPERATING AT BOTH THE

03:15:09.197 --> 03:15:10.698
STATEWIDE.

03:15:10.765 --> 03:15:13.835
AND LOCAL LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA.

03:15:13.902 --> 03:15:15.003
WE KNOW THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE

03:15:15.070 --> 03:15:17.072
OF COURSE THE LAN THE LANDS

03:15:17.138 --> 03:15:18.339
TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AS MR BONTA

03:15:18.406 --> 03:15:19.774
ALLUDED.

03:15:19.841 --> 03:15:21.076
TO THEY WERE CREATED TO BE --

03:15:21.142 --> 03:15:22.877
LABORATORIES OF LEARNING AND

03:15:22.944 --> 03:15:24.345
HAVE SERVED A VITAL ROLE.

03:15:24.412 --> 03:15:25.346
HOWEVER THIS CHARTER SCHOOL

03:15:25.413 --> 03:15:27.849
GROWTH HAS PLAYED A ROLE.

03:15:27.916 --> 03:15:30.518
NOT THE ROLE A ROLE IN THE

03:15:30.585 --> 03:15:32.854
FINANCIAL INSTABILITY FOR SCHOOL

03:15:32.921 --> 03:15:34.889
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE OF

03:15:34.956 --> 03:15:35.657
CALIFORNIA.

03:15:35.723 --> 03:15:36.524
CHARTER SCHOOL GROWTH HAS

03:15:36.591 --> 03:15:38.827
REMAINED STEADY IN THE STATE

03:15:38.893 --> 03:15:40.628
OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS.

03:15:40.695 --> 03:15:41.896
LEADING TO MORE AND MORE AND

03:15:41.963 --> 03:15:43.598
STABILITY WE ALL KNOW THAT

03:15:43.665 --> 03:15:44.766
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FUNDED

03:15:44.833 --> 03:15:46.801
BASED UPON ATA AVERAGE DAILY

03:15:46.868 --> 03:15:47.669
ATTENDANCE.

03:15:47.735 --> 03:15:50.138
AT IS DECLINING STATEWIDE.

03:15:50.205 --> 03:15:51.806
THAT MEANS FEWER FUNDING AND

03:15:51.873 --> 03:15:53.141
FEWER THAT MEANS LESS FUNDING

03:15:53.208 --> 03:15:55.043
AND FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR

03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:56.277
STUDENTS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF

03:15:56.344 --> 03:15:59.080
COURSE ETA'S DECLINE BECAUSE OF

03:15:59.147 --> 03:16:00.482
THE POPULATION OUR STATE.

03:16:00.548 --> 03:16:01.883
BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE GROWTH

03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:03.284
OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS

03:16:03.351 --> 03:16:04.419
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

03:16:04.486 --> 03:16:06.121
COMPETITION FOR THESE SCARCE

03:16:06.187 --> 03:16:07.789
EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS BETWEEN

03:16:07.856 --> 03:16:09.691
DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOL.

03:16:09.757 --> 03:16:11.626
BREED STRESS AND TENSION THAT'S

03:16:11.693 --> 03:16:13.828
LEADING TO A SCHOOLS WEARING IS.

03:16:13.895 --> 03:16:15.597
TO OPEN ADDITIONAL CHARTERS OF

03:16:15.663 --> 03:16:16.231
COURSE.

03:16:16.297 --> 03:16:17.699
MANY TITLE ONE SCHOOLS FACE

03:16:17.765 --> 03:16:20.368
GREAT CHALLENGES WITH EDUCATING

03:16:20.435 --> 03:16:21.736
OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS IN

03:16:21.803 --> 03:16:23.171
CALIFORNIA.

03:16:23.238 --> 03:16:24.672
A SPREADING FINITE RESOURCES

03:16:24.739 --> 03:16:26.407
AMONG BOTH CHARTER SCHOOLS AND

03:16:26.474 --> 03:16:27.876
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS

03:16:27.942 --> 03:16:30.778
NEGATIVELY IMPACTS EQUITY IN

03:16:30.845 --> 03:16:31.880
SKIN A SCHOOL DISTRICT.

03:16:31.946 --> 03:16:33.381
EVEN IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DID

03:16:33.448 --> 03:16:36.084
NOT APPROVE THAT CHARTER SCHOOL.

03:16:36.151 --> 03:16:37.585
ESSENTIAL WE HAVE THROUGHOUT

03:16:37.652 --> 03:16:38.520
CALIFORNIA.

03:16:38.586 --> 03:16:40.522
IS WERE FUNDING TO SCHOOL

03:16:40.588 --> 03:16:43.491
SYSTEMS.

03:16:43.558 --> 03:16:45.026
LIKE A FAMILY.

03:16:45.093 --> 03:16:46.194
WITH THAT.

03:16:46.261 --> 03:16:48.196
WITH THAT THE I. CAPPED INCOME.

03:16:48.263 --> 03:16:49.097
FUNDING TO HOUSEHOLDS.

03:16:49.164 --> 03:16:51.032
IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE.

03:16:51.099 --> 03:16:52.600
THIS BILL WILL GRANT SCHOOL

03:16:52.667 --> 03:16:54.602
DISTRICT WITH SOME FINANCIAL

03:16:54.669 --> 03:16:56.938
RELIEF BY CURBING CHARTER SCHOOL

03:16:57.005 --> 03:16:58.206
SCHOOL GROWTH.

03:16:58.273 --> 03:17:00.008
IT'S NOT A BAND IT'S NOT A

03:17:00.074 --> 03:17:02.510
MORATORIUM HAVE SOME VAST I

03:17:02.577 --> 03:17:05.680
THINK THIS IS A FAIR SOLUTION.

03:17:05.747 --> 03:17:07.916
IT WON'T CLOSE SCHOOLS AGAIN

03:17:07.982 --> 03:17:10.718
THIS WILL NOT CLOSE SCHOOLS.

03:17:10.785 --> 03:17:13.388
DESPITE WHICH MANY -- THINK WITH

03:17:13.454 --> 03:17:14.556
THE OPPOSITION.

03:17:14.622 --> 03:17:16.224
THIS BILL WOULD INSTITUTE A

03:17:16.291 --> 03:17:17.192
ROLLING CAP.

03:17:17.258 --> 03:17:19.093
MEANING THAT WHEN A CHARTER

03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:20.195
SCHOOL CLOSES.

03:17:20.261 --> 03:17:22.230
ANOTHER CHARTER SCHOOL MAY TAKE

03:17:22.297 --> 03:17:22.964
THAT SLOT

03:17:23.031 --> 03:17:24.365
AND WE'RE AND WE'RE WE'RE

03:17:24.432 --> 03:17:25.934
ADJUSTING AND AMENDING THE

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:27.635
PROPOSAL NOT ON THE ACTUAL

03:17:27.702 --> 03:17:29.971
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS BUT UPON THE

03:17:30.038 --> 03:17:30.972
ATA.

03:17:31.039 --> 03:17:33.074
SO IN OTHER WORDS KIND OF THINK

03:17:33.141 --> 03:17:34.475
ABOUT CAP AND TRADE HERE.

03:17:34.542 --> 03:17:37.245
SO IF A FAILING SCHOOL NOT A

03:17:37.312 --> 03:17:38.947
GOOD ANALYSIS CAP AND TRADE NOT

03:17:39.013 --> 03:17:40.415
A POPULAR PROGRAM.

03:17:40.481 --> 03:17:41.683
BUT THE MATHEMATICAL PART ABOUT

03:17:41.749 --> 03:17:42.884
CAP AND TRADE.

03:17:42.951 --> 03:17:44.219
IS SOMETHING WE WE WE CLEARLY

03:17:44.285 --> 03:17:45.587
UNDERSTAND.

03:17:45.653 --> 03:17:46.654
SO IF ONE OF THAT.

03:17:46.721 --> 03:17:47.989
POOR PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL

03:17:48.056 --> 03:17:49.724
CLOSES AND WE HAVE A THRIVING

03:17:49.791 --> 03:17:50.792
CHARTER SCHOOL LIKE WE HEARD

03:17:50.858 --> 03:17:52.527
FROM EARLIER TODAY DRIVING

03:17:52.594 --> 03:17:54.696
CHARTER SCHOOLS.

03:17:54.762 --> 03:17:56.431
THEY CAN OPEN THIS PLACE.

03:17:56.497 --> 03:17:59.067
A ROLLING CAT.

03:17:59.133 --> 03:18:00.802
AGAIN THIS RECOGNIZES THAT THE

03:18:00.868 --> 03:18:02.503
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THAT CHARTER

03:18:02.570 --> 03:18:05.340
SCHOOLS HAVE ON THE DISTRICT'S.

03:18:05.406 --> 03:18:06.674
COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATIONAL

03:18:06.741 --> 03:18:09.077
PROGRAM AND FINANCES.

03:18:09.143 --> 03:18:10.378
AT THAT TWO THINGS ABOUT THEIR

03:18:10.445 --> 03:18:13.114
FINANCES YOU KNOW WE HAVE

03:18:13.181 --> 03:18:14.382
DISTRICTS IN FINANCIAL STRESS.

03:18:14.449 --> 03:18:15.917
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT LOS ANGELES

03:18:15.984 --> 03:18:17.452
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT OAKLAND.

03:18:17.518 --> 03:18:19.020
RIGHT HERE IN MY HOMETOWN OF

03:18:19.087 --> 03:18:21.055
SACRAMENTO OUR DISTRICT IS

03:18:21.122 --> 03:18:22.423
LITERALLY ON THE BRINK.

03:18:22.490 --> 03:18:24.459
MAY RUN OUT OF CASH IN THE

03:18:24.525 --> 03:18:26.794
COMING MONTHS.

03:18:26.861 --> 03:18:27.829
IS IT BECAUSE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS.

03:18:27.895 --> 03:18:29.564
PROBABLY NOT PROBABLY WASN'T THE

03:18:29.631 --> 03:18:32.033
ISSUE IS IT A FACTOR IT'S GOING

03:18:32.100 --> 03:18:33.534
ON AS FAR AS THEIR THEIR

03:18:33.601 --> 03:18:35.536
ATTENDANCE.

03:18:35.603 --> 03:18:36.671
POTENTIALLY THERE ARE CHARTER

03:18:36.738 --> 03:18:38.806
SCHOOL POPULATION TO ABOUT 12%.

03:18:38.873 --> 03:18:40.975
ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED

03:18:41.042 --> 03:18:42.110
STUDENTS HOWEVER.

03:18:42.176 --> 03:18:44.712
IF THAT GREW BY 10% NEXT YEAR TO

03:18:44.779 --> 03:18:46.881
THE THEIR FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN

03:18:46.948 --> 03:18:48.082
FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY AND THE

03:18:48.149 --> 03:18:49.550
YEAR AFTER THAT -- THOUSAND

03:18:49.617 --> 03:18:51.853
STUDENTS THAT GROWTH WOULD PUT

03:18:51.919 --> 03:18:53.254
THIS DISTRICT ON THE BRINK.

03:18:53.321 --> 03:18:54.822
AND THAT'S WERE FACING UP AND

03:18:54.889 --> 03:18:56.557
DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:18:56.624 --> 03:18:57.091
SO THAT'S THE ISSUE WE'RE

03:18:57.158 --> 03:18:58.826
LOOKING TO ADDRESS I ALSO WANT

03:18:58.893 --> 03:19:01.763
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE

03:19:01.829 --> 03:19:03.298
REPORT COMING BY OUR GOVERNOR.

03:19:03.364 --> 03:19:05.033

OUR COLLEAGUE MR BONTA SAID IT

03:19:06.367 --> 03:19:07.969
WELL THAT'S THE THOSE ARE TWO

03:19:08.036 --> 03:19:09.437
STATEWIDE ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE

03:19:09.504 --> 03:19:10.571
THE LEGISLATURE.

03:19:10.638 --> 03:19:11.973
WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN

03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:12.940
THIS AS WELL.

03:19:13.007 --> 03:19:14.876
BUT SHOULD THIS REPORT COME OUT

WITH SOME GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS --

03:19:17.779 --> 03:19:19.847
REST ASSURED THAT THIS BILL WILL

03:19:19.914 --> 03:19:21.182
NOT BECOME LAW.

03:19:21.249 --> 03:19:22.817
WHEN THAT REPORT COMES OUT WE'LL

03:19:22.884 --> 03:19:24.419
BE GOING AT IT AS WE KNOW UNTIL

03:20:13.267 --> 03:20:14.302
EDUCATIONAL IMPACT OF

03:20:14.369 --> 03:20:15.570
CALIFORNIA'S UNRESTRICTED

03:20:15.636 --> 03:20:17.805
CHARTER SECTOR GROWTH ON

03:20:17.872 --> 03:20:19.674

THESE IMPACTS.

03:20:24.278 --> 03:20:25.246
ARE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT

03:20:25.313 --> 03:20:26.848
SPENDING BLIND EXAMINED

03:20:26.914 --> 03:20:27.849
CALIFORNIA'S ON TARGETED IN

HAPHAZARD SYSTEM FOR FACILITIES

03:20:30.485 --> 03:20:32.153
FINANCING OF CHARTER SCHOOLS.

03:20:32.220 --> 03:20:32.954
WE FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA'S

03:20:33.020 --> 03:20:33.988
CHARTER SCHOOLS HAD RECEIVED

03:20:34.055 --> 03:20:35.757
MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE BILLION

03:20:35.823 --> 03:20:36.724
DOLLARS.

03:20:36.791 --> 03:20:37.925
IN IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE

03:20:37.992 --> 03:20:39.761
TAXPAYERS SUBSIDIZE FUNDS TO

03:20:39.827 --> 03:20:40.561
LEASE BUILDER BY SCHOOL

03:20:40.628 --> 03:20:41.429
BUILDINGS.

03:20:41.496 --> 03:20:42.397
MUCH OF THIS FUNDING WENT TO

03:20:42.463 --> 03:20:43.631
SCHOOL THAT OPENED WHERE THERE

03:20:43.698 --> 03:20:44.699
ARE ALREADY ENOUGH CLASSROOM

03:20:44.766 --> 03:20:46.200
SPACES FOR ALL STUDENTS.

03:20:46.267 --> 03:20:47.468
AND TO SCHOOL THAT DID NOT

03:20:47.535 --> 03:20:48.536
PROVIDE A BETTER ACADEMIC

03:20:48.603 --> 03:20:50.238
OUTCOMES THE NEARBY TRADITIONAL

03:20:50.304 --> 03:20:53.941
PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT SERVE

03:20:54.008 --> 03:20:55.343
DEMOGRAPHICALLY SIMILAR STUDENTS.

03:20:55.410 --> 03:20:55.977
WE FOUND THE PUBLIC FACILITIES

03:20:56.043 --> 03:20:56.377
FUNDING HAD BEEN

03:20:56.444 --> 03:20:57.645
DISPROPORTIONATELY CONCENTRATED

03:20:57.712 --> 03:20:59.547
AMONG THE LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF

03:20:59.614 --> 03:21:00.114
SCHOOLS THAT ARE OWNED AND

03:21:00.181 --> 03:21:01.549
OPERATED BY CHARTER MANAGEMENT

03:21:01.616 --> 03:21:02.717
ORGANIZATIONS.

03:21:02.784 --> 03:21:04.719
OPERATING CHAINS OF BETWEEN

03:21:04.786 --> 03:21:06.187
THREE AND THIRTY SCHOOLS.

03:21:06.254 --> 03:21:07.655
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PUBLIC

03:21:07.722 --> 03:21:08.723
TAX DOLLARS HAD ALSO BEEN USED

03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:10.425
BY CMO IS TO BUY PRIVATE

03:21:10.491 --> 03:21:11.926
PROPERTY.

03:21:11.993 --> 03:21:15.029
OUR SECOND REPORT RELEASED IN --

03:21:15.096 --> 03:21:16.831
TWENTY EIGHTEEN DOCUMENTS -- THE

03:21:16.898 --> 03:21:18.499
IMPACT ON LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS

03:21:18.566 --> 03:21:19.333
SO WHEN A STUDENT LEAVE THE

03:21:19.400 --> 03:21:20.301
NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL FOR CHARTER

03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:21.769
SCHOOL ALL THE FUNDING FOR THAT

03:21:21.836 --> 03:21:23.337
STUDENT LEAVES WITH THEM HOWEVER

03:21:23.404 --> 03:21:24.772
NOT ALL THE COSTS.

03:21:24.839 --> 03:21:25.873
TO OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT

03:21:25.940 --> 03:21:27.141
BREAKING POINT DOCUMENTED THESE

03:21:27.208 --> 03:21:28.709
NOT COSTS OF CALIFORNIA'S AND

03:21:28.776 --> 03:21:30.278
RESTRAINED CHARTER GROWTH WHICH

03:21:30.344 --> 03:21:31.512
LEADS TO CUTTING CORE SERVICES

03:21:31.579 --> 03:21:32.947
LIKE COUNSELING IN LIBRARIES AND

03:21:33.014 --> 03:21:34.115
NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

03:21:34.182 --> 03:21:35.516
USING OUR MOST CONSERVATIVE

03:21:35.583 --> 03:21:36.951
ESTIMATES WE FOUND THAT OAKLAND

03:21:37.018 --> 03:21:38.719
UNIFIED LOST FIFTY SEVEN POINT

03:21:38.786 --> 03:21:39.854
THREE MILLION PER YEAR.

03:21:39.921 --> 03:21:41.189
THAT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED

03:21:41.255 --> 03:21:42.123
LESS PER STUDENT ATTENDING A

03:21:42.190 --> 03:21:43.758
NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL THE ANNUAL

03:21:43.825 --> 03:21:45.860
COST OF SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WAS

03:21:45.927 --> 03:21:47.061
SIXTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION.

03:21:47.128 --> 03:21:48.529
AND HE SAID UNION HIGH SCHOOL

03:21:48.596 --> 03:21:49.897
DISTRICT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY

03:21:49.964 --> 03:21:51.065
THE NET IMPACT OF CHARTER

03:21:51.132 --> 03:21:54.469
SCHOOLS WAS NINETEEN POINT THREE

03:32:46.019 --> 03:32:47.087
THE CASE OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL

03:32:47.154 --> 03:32:48.755
SYSTEM THAT I RUN THE COUNTY

03:32:48.822 --> 03:32:50.724

03:32:50.791 --> 03:32:52.526
FINDING OF FACT BASED.

03:32:52.593 --> 03:32:54.161
BACK IN.

03:32:54.228 --> 03:32:54.761
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT THERE

03:32:54.828 --> 03:32:55.729
IS A SEVERE AND PERSISTENT

03:32:55.796 --> 03:32:57.397
AFRICAN AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT GAP

03:32:57.464 --> 03:32:59.833
IN ALL OF THE TH THE COUNTIES

03:32:59.900 --> 03:33:01.001
THIRTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

03:33:01.068 --> 03:33:02.136
SUCH A THERE IS NO PLACE AN

03:33:02.202 --> 03:33:04.304
AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY COULD GO

AND NOT CONFRONT THIS GAP.

03:33:05.672 --> 03:33:07.040
AND SO THEY CHIU CHOSE TO

03:33:07.107 --> 03:33:09.376
EXERCISE THEIR AUTHORITY. TO

03:33:09.443 --> 03:33:11.078

03:33:15.215 --> 03:33:17.117

WE ARE THE ONLY CHARTER SCHOOL

03:33:18.752 --> 03:33:20.387
THAT THAT THE COUNTY BOARD OF

03:33:20.454 --> 03:33:22.055
EDUCATION APPROVES SO IN THE

03:33:22.122 --> 03:33:23.557
CASE OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS

03:33:23.624 --> 03:33:24.525
BILL.

03:33:24.591 --> 03:33:26.527
WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IS THAT IN

03:33:26.593 --> 03:33:27.961
ORDER FOR A NEW?

03:33:28.028 --> 03:33:29.363
CHARTER SCHOOL FROM FORTUNE

03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:30.864
SCHOOL TO BE OPEN AN EXISTING

03:33:30.931 --> 03:33:33.400
CHARTER SCHOOL AND AND FORTUNE

03:33:33.467 --> 03:33:35.068
SCHOOL WOULD HAVE TO BE CLOSED --

03:33:35.135 --> 03:33:36.403
IT WOULD CANNIBALIZE OUR SCHOOL

03:33:36.470 --> 03:33:38.372
SYSTEM.

03:33:38.438 --> 03:33:40.774
THIS IS A TIGHT RESTRICTION ON

03:33:40.841 --> 03:33:43.010
THE PROGRESS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS.

03:33:43.076 --> 03:33:47.047
AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT.

03:33:47.114 --> 03:33:48.615
THERE ARE STUDENTS.

03:33:48.682 --> 03:33:50.617
AND YOU SAW MANY OF THEIR

03:33:50.684 --> 03:33:52.252
PARENTS TODAY.

03:33:52.319 --> 03:33:53.787
AND THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES.

03:33:53.854 --> 03:33:55.088
THAT ARE DESPERATELY SEEKING

03:33:55.155 --> 03:33:57.491
ANOTHER OPTION WITHIN THE PUBLIC

03:33:57.558 --> 03:34:01.461
SCHOOL SYSTEM -- THAT -- THAT

03:34:01.528 --> 03:34:03.997
DESIRE IS REAL -- YOU CAN'T FAKE

03:34:04.064 --> 03:34:05.732
THAT.

03:34:05.799 --> 03:34:06.667
AND IN THE CASE OF THE BLACK

03:34:06.733 --> 03:34:08.168
COMMUNITY IT'S VERY WILL

03:34:08.235 --> 03:34:09.570
ESTABLISH THE BLACK STUDENTS ARE

03:34:09.636 --> 03:34:10.704
THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP

03:34:10.771 --> 03:34:12.139
OTHER OUTSIDE OF STUDENTS WITH

03:34:12.206 --> 03:34:13.807
SPECIAL NEEDS.

03:34:13.874 --> 03:34:15.209
THE DISTRICT THAT MR MCCARTY

03:34:15.275 --> 03:34:16.643
MAKES REFERENCE TO SACK CITY

03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:18.545
ONLY 13% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN

03:34:18.612 --> 03:34:20.614
STUDENTS MEET STEP MET STANDARDS

03:34:20.681 --> 03:34:22.049
ON THE LAST STATE ASSESSMENT OF

03:34:22.115 --> 03:34:25.285
MATHEMATICS.

03:34:25.352 --> 03:34:27.354
A CAP ON SCHOOLS.

03:34:27.421 --> 03:34:29.189
BETTER DESIGNED TO CLOSE THOSE

03:34:29.256 --> 03:34:30.324
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS.

03:34:30.390 --> 03:34:33.293
ARE IS A REAL INJUSTICE TO THE

03:34:33.360 --> 03:34:36.863
FAMILIES THAT NEED OPPORTUNITIES.

03:34:36.930 --> 03:34:38.332
THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL.

03:34:38.398 --> 03:34:40.834
IS THAT IT SUGGESTS THAT NGUYEN

03:34:40.901 --> 03:34:42.102
AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A NEW

03:34:42.169 --> 03:34:44.938
SCHOOL I WOULD WOULD BE CREATED

03:34:45.005 --> 03:34:45.739
THAT.

03:34:45.806 --> 03:34:47.541
AN EXPERIENCED OPERATOR COULDN'T

03:34:47.608 --> 03:34:50.077
DO THAT WORK -- AND SO FOR THOSE

03:34:50.143 --> 03:34:51.678
REASONS -- WE STAND IN

03:34:51.745 --> 03:34:55.682
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.

03:34:55.749 --> 03:34:56.883
GOOD AFTERNOON CARLOS ARE CARED

03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:58.218
CABS HERE REPRESENTING THAT

03:34:58.285 --> 03:34:59.620
CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS

03:34:59.686 --> 03:35:03.724
ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. TO AB --

03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:05.058
FIFTEEN OH SIX AS MISFORTUNE

03:35:05.125 --> 03:35:07.728
HIGHLIGHTED BRIEFLY A. B.

03:35:07.794 --> 03:35:08.495
FIFTEEN OH SIX MAKES AN

03:35:08.562 --> 03:35:09.863
ARBITRARY JUDGMENT THAT SOMEHOW

03:35:09.930 --> 03:35:12.199
NEW SINGLE SITE CHARTERS ARE

03:35:12.266 --> 03:35:13.267
BETTER PREPARED TO MEET THE

03:35:13.333 --> 03:35:14.501
NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

03:35:14.568 --> 03:35:15.502
STUDENTS.

03:35:15.569 --> 03:35:17.170
OVER OPERATORS WITH A PROVEN

03:35:17.237 --> 03:35:19.006
TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS

03:35:19.072 --> 03:35:20.707
OPERATING EXISTING SCHOOLS.

03:35:20.774 --> 03:35:22.276
THIS POLICY RUNS COUNTER TO

03:35:22.342 --> 03:35:23.810
STRONG EVIDENCE BY THE CENTER

03:35:23.877 --> 03:35:25.112
FOR RESEARCH ON EDUCATED ON

03:35:25.178 --> 03:35:27.114
EDUCATION OUTCOMES AT STANFORD.

03:35:27.180 --> 03:35:29.082
THAT IN CALIFORNI IN BOTH THE

03:35:29.149 --> 03:35:32.119
READING AND MATH STUDENTS IN CMO

03:35:32.185 --> 03:35:33.487
TO HAVE LARGER LEARNING GAINES

03:35:33.553 --> 03:35:34.554
PER YEAR.

03:35:34.621 --> 03:35:36.223
THEN THERE DISTRICT COUNTERPARTS

03:35:36.290 --> 03:35:38.492
AND THEN THERE INDEPENDENT

03:35:38.558 --> 03:35:40.093
SINGLE SITE CHARTER SCHOOL PEERS.

03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:41.428
THE DIFFERENCE IS EQUIVALENT TO

03:35:41.495 --> 03:35:42.963
A STUDENT ATTENDING SEVENTEEN

03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:45.132
ADDITIONAL DAYS OF SCHOOL PER

03:35:45.198 --> 03:35:46.767
LEARNING IN BOTH SUBJECTS.

03:35:46.833 --> 03:35:48.168
SO THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF

03:35:48.235 --> 03:35:50.370
ATTENDING A CMO IS EVEN LARGER

03:35:50.437 --> 03:35:51.938
FOR BLACK IN LATIN NEXT STUDENTS

03:35:52.005 --> 03:35:52.973
AND THE GAINES EVEN GREATER

03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:54.508
AMONG BLACK IN LATIN NEXT

03:35:54.574 --> 03:35:56.076
STUDENTS IN POVERTY.

03:35:56.143 --> 03:35:57.277
AND THESE ARE THE SAME STUDENTS

03:35:57.344 --> 03:35:58.879
OF GROUPS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED

03:35:58.945 --> 03:36:03.050
THE WIDEST LEARNING GAPS IN

03:36:03.116 --> 03:36:04.918
DISTRICT SCHOOLS.

03:36:04.985 --> 03:36:06.086
AS STANFORD RESEARCH FINDS AND

03:36:06.153 --> 03:36:06.687
SO FURTHER WE NEW SCHOOLS ARE

03:36:06.753 --> 03:36:08.922
REPLICATED BY SEE A MOST.

03:36:08.989 --> 03:36:10.123
CREDO FOUND THAT THOSE SCHOOLS

03:36:10.190 --> 03:36:11.925
PRODUCE LEARNING RESULTS IN

03:36:11.992 --> 03:36:13.527
THEIR FIRST YEAR THAT ARE MORE

03:36:13.593 --> 03:36:14.761
POSITIVE THAN THEIR DISTRICT

03:36:14.828 --> 03:36:16.863
PEERS SO THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS

03:36:16.930 --> 03:36:18.565
THAT SEE A MOST IN CALIFORNIA.

03:36:18.632 --> 03:36:20.167
I UNDERSTAND THIS HOW TO SCALE

03:36:20.233 --> 03:36:21.568
AND REPLICATE HIGH QUALITY

SUBSECTION EIGHT TWO OF YOUR

BILL SAYS THAT -- THE PRIORITY

04:09:33.992 --> 04:09:35.093

PETITION SUBMITTED UNDER THIS

CHARTER SCHOOL.

04:09:43.234 --> 04:09:45.403

IT'S HER SCHOOLS HAVE A TRACK

04:09:46.304 --> 04:09:48.340
RECORD OF CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT

04:09:48.406 --> 04:09:50.575
GAPS AND YOUR BILL WOULD DE

04:09:50.642 --> 04:09:52.043
PRIORITIZE FOR POSITION

04:09:52.110 --> 04:09:55.046
PRECISELY ON THAT BASIS.

04:09:55.113 --> 04:09:57.449
WHY IS THIS GOOD POLICY?

04:09:57.515 --> 04:09:58.149
WELL I THERE'S THERE'S TWO

04:09:58.216 --> 04:10:00.251

04:10:00.318 --> 04:10:00.552
[inaudible]

04:10:00.618 --> 04:10:01.353
SO [inaudible]

04:10:01.419 --> 04:10:04.889
THE FOR EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO HER

04:10:04.956 --> 04:10:06.624
AUTHORIZES SAT COUNTY ONE OF FOR

04:10:06.691 --> 04:10:08.626
CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD NOT HAVE

04:10:08.693 --> 04:10:09.260
TO CLOSE DOWN FEATHER WENT TO

04:10:09.327 --> 04:10:10.161
OPEN UP.

04:10:10.228 --> 04:10:11.262
BUT THERE IS A THOUGHT THAT

04:10:11.329 --> 04:10:13.932
WE'RE CURRENTLY EVALUATING AND

04:10:13.998 --> 04:10:15.967
AND SHOULD WE MOVE FORWARD WILL

04:10:16.034 --> 04:10:16.935
KEY LOOK AT IT.

04:10:17.001 --> 04:10:19.671
IS SIMPLY A ALLOW THESE -- YOU

04:10:19.738 --> 04:10:21.373
KNOW LACK OF BETTER TERM

04:10:21.439 --> 04:10:23.308
CORPORATE STYLE AT T. CHARTER

04:10:23.375 --> 04:10:24.809
OPERATORS TO COME INTO COMMUNITY

04:10:24.876 --> 04:10:26.010
AND OPEN.

04:10:26.077 --> 04:10:27.445
ONE WHEN THEY REALLY ARE GONNA

04:10:27.512 --> 04:10:29.347
BE FOCUSED ON THAT COMMUNITY.

04:10:29.414 --> 04:10:30.648
LIKE A LOCAL ENTITY WAY.

04:10:30.715 --> 04:10:31.950
SO THE NOTION IS TO GIVE

04:10:32.016 --> 04:10:33.418
PRIORITIES TO A NEW CHARTER

04:10:33.485 --> 04:10:34.853
OPERATOR THAT AS MORE ROOTS IN

04:10:34.919 --> 04:10:36.354
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

04:10:36.421 --> 04:10:38.323
HOWEVER -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT

04:10:38.390 --> 04:10:39.724
RECENTLY.

04:10:39.791 --> 04:10:42.627
WAS -- EVALUATED WHEN WE SAT

04:10:42.694 --> 04:10:45.029

04:10:49.234 --> 04:10:49.801
OR OUT OF IT OR MAYBE MODIFYING

04:10:49.868 --> 04:10:50.635
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND

04:10:50.702 --> 04:10:52.003
WORKING AT THAT THE SO I THINK

04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:53.138
IT RAISES SOME LEGITIMATE

04:10:53.204 --> 04:10:55.273
QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT.

04:10:55.340 --> 04:10:57.308
IF THERE IS CAPACITY HAS SOME WE

04:10:57.375 --> 04:10:58.443
ALL AGREE THERE ARE SOME BAD

04:10:58.510 --> 04:11:00.111
OPERATORS AND SO IF IF A CHARTER

04:11:00.178 --> 04:11:02.847
SCHOOL -- SHUTS DOWN.

04:11:02.914 --> 04:11:05.049

AND WE HAVE CAPACITY TO OPEN UP

04:11:08.153 --> 04:11:09.821
A NEW SCHOOL SERVING ADDITIONAL

04:11:09.888 --> 04:11:12.056
STUDENTS BASED UPON THAT.

04:11:12.123 --> 04:11:12.891
EIGHTY EIGHT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON

04:11:12.957 --> 04:11:15.193
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE COMMUNITY

WHAT'S GOING TO BE A STABLE

04:11:15.827 --> 04:11:16.594
ENTITY THERE.

04:11:16.661 --> 04:11:23.535
CAN BE A LONG TERM NET POSITIVE

04:11:23.601 --> 04:11:25.270
FOR THE COMMUNITY.

04:11:25.336 --> 04:11:26.471
THERE'S BEEN THAT SOME REFERENCE

04:11:26.538 --> 04:11:27.472
TO A STUDY FROM -- THE STANFORD

04:11:27.539 --> 04:11:28.473

THE RECORD I WANT -- TO SAY WHAT

04:11:32.811 --> 04:11:33.378
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT STUDY

04:11:33.445 --> 04:11:35.713
FOUND HI THIS IS A QUOTE IN

04:11:35.780 --> 04:11:36.314
TERMS OF ACADEMIC GROWTH OVER

04:11:36.381 --> 04:11:37.749
TIME CHARTER SCHOOLS TO

04:11:37.816 --> 04:11:38.783
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN

04:11:38.850 --> 04:11:40.218
DISTRICT SCHOOLS AND URBAN AREAS.

04:11:40.285 --> 04:11:41.352
AND PROFESSIONALLY LOWER

04:11:41.419 --> 04:11:43.221
PERFORMING STUDENT GROUPS AS

04:11:43.288 --> 04:11:44.556

STUDENTS ARE ECONOMICALLY

04:11:45.824 --> 04:11:47.625
DISADVANTAGED ESPECIALLY THOSE

04:11:47.692 --> 04:11:48.927
WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO

04:11:48.993 --> 04:11:49.994
IT'S A DEFINITELY GREATER

04:11:50.061 --> 04:11:51.129
PROGRESS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN

04:11:51.196 --> 04:11:52.630
THEIR MATCH PEERS IN TRADITIONAL

04:11:52.697 --> 04:11:53.698
PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

04:11:53.765 --> 04:11:54.999
BLACK STUDENTS IN GENERAL FOUND

04:11:55.066 --> 04:11:56.167

04:11:56.234 --> 04:11:57.302
CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE ACT IN A

04:11:57.368 --> 04:11:58.503
PROGRESS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN

04:11:58.570 --> 04:12:00.371
STUDENTS AND POVERTY WAS EVEN

04:12:00.438 --> 04:12:01.639
MORE POSITIVELY AFFECTED.

04:12:01.706 --> 04:12:03.141
CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE GREATER

04:12:03.208 --> 04:12:04.342
LEARNING GAMES FOR STUDENTS

04:12:04.409 --> 04:12:06.945

LANGUAGE LEARNERS THE CHARTER

04:12:08.947 --> 04:12:09.881
SCHOOL ADVANTAGES PARTICULARLY

04:12:09.948 --> 04:12:11.483
LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT WHICH IS

04:12:11.549 --> 04:12:12.851
NOT TYPICAL IN OTHER STATES.

04:12:12.917 --> 04:12:14.085
AND FINALLY CHARTER SCHOOL

04:12:14.152 --> 04:12:14.586
SERVING DIVERSE STUDENT

04:12:14.652 --> 04:12:16.387

AMERICAN IN THE STATE AS A WHOLE.

04:12:20.692 --> 04:12:21.926
SO GIVEN THESE FACTS WHY IS THIS

04:12:21.993 --> 04:12:23.094
THE SECTOR OF OUR PUBLIC

04:12:23.161 --> 04:12:26.130
EDUCATION SYSTEM WHOSE GROWTH WE

04:12:26.197 --> 04:12:27.165

REALITY CHECK FOR A SCHOOL

04:12:37.041 --> 04:12:39.777
DISTRICTS AND OUR TAXPAYERS THE

04:12:39.844 --> 04:12:40.512

04:12:46.017 --> 04:12:47.552
BUT THEN VITAL GROWTH YEAR AFTER

04:12:47.619 --> 04:12:49.654
YEAR AFTER YEAR HAS A NEGATIVE

04:12:49.721 --> 04:12:51.189
IMPACT.

04:12:51.256 --> 04:12:52.857
ON OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM

04:12:52.924 --> 04:12:53.358
AND WE'RE GONNA SEE THE

04:12:53.424 --> 04:12:54.959
CONSEQUENCES HEARING YOUR

04:12:55.026 --> 04:12:56.561
COMMUNITIES IN MY COMMUNITY AT

04:12:56.628 --> 04:12:58.730
THE STATE CAPITOL AND THIS IS AN

04:12:58.796 --> 04:13:01.199
OPPORTUNITY. TO ALLOW CHARTER

04:13:01.266 --> 04:13:02.600
SCHOOLS TO THRIVE THAT ARE

04:13:02.667 --> 04:13:03.768
EXISTING TODAY.

04:13:03.835 --> 04:13:05.503
AND CONTRARY TO THE LETTERS THAT

04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:07.272
I GOT OVER AND OVER FROM ROCKET

04:13:07.338 --> 04:13:07.972
SHIP.

04:13:08.039 --> 04:13:09.007
WITH THESE MEASURES ARE NOT

04:13:09.073 --> 04:13:12.243
GOING TO CLOSE DOWN.

04:13:12.310 --> 04:13:13.778
CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS CASE I'M

04:13:13.845 --> 04:13:16.915
GONNA PUT A MORATORIUM.

04:13:16.981 --> 04:13:18.816
SOME OF ASKED ME TO GO DOWN.

04:13:18.883 --> 04:13:19.417
SOME OF SAID WE SHOULD GET RID

04:13:19.484 --> 04:13:20.051
OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS IS NOT

04:13:20.118 --> 04:13:22.320
THAT THIS I THINK IS A FAIR

04:13:22.387 --> 04:13:24.322
SOLUTION WHICH ALLOWED CHARTER

04:13:24.389 --> 04:13:25.623
SCHOOLS TO THRIVE.

04:13:25.690 --> 04:13:27.292
AND ASK POPULATIONS DECREASE

04:13:27.358 --> 04:13:29.227
RESISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS WE CAN

04:13:29.294 --> 04:13:30.862
OPEN NEW ONES BUT PROVIDING SOME

04:13:30.929 --> 04:13:32.363
FINANCIAL BREATHING ROOM.

04:13:32.430 --> 04:13:34.399
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S UP AND

04:13:34.465 --> 04:13:36.568
DOWN CALIFORNIA.

04:13:36.634 --> 04:13:37.869
I JUST WANT TO CLEAR CHARTER

04:13:37.936 --> 04:13:39.737
SCHOOLS ARE PART OF THE PUBLIC

04:13:39.804 --> 04:13:40.605
EDUCATION SYSTEM.

04:13:40.672 --> 04:13:42.674
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT.

04:13:42.740 --> 04:13:43.775
FOLKS THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE

04:13:43.841 --> 04:13:44.976
THERE YOU KNOW VOLUNTARY KNOWN

04:13:45.043 --> 04:13:46.277
SPORTS GO TO ANY PARTICULAR

04:13:46.344 --> 04:13:47.912
SCHOOL SO I'D ASK YOU TO KEEP

04:13:47.979 --> 04:13:48.446
THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU MAKE

04:13:48.513 --> 04:13:50.114
CLAIMS ABOUT.

04:13:50.181 --> 04:13:51.950
OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AS A

04:13:52.016 --> 04:13:52.150
WHOLE.

04:13:52.216 --> 04:13:56.621
THANK YOU.

04:13:56.688 --> 04:13:59.090
SEE NO FURTHER COMING FROM

04:13:59.157 --> 04:14:01.125
COMMITTEES A BILL THEN MOVED.

04:14:01.192 --> 04:14:03.328
WELL I I I I WILL NOT JUST

04:14:03.394 --> 04:14:04.762
REITERATE WHAT I'VE SAID OF

04:14:04.829 --> 04:14:06.497
COURSE IN TERMS OF PROCESS.

04:14:06.564 --> 04:14:08.433
BUT I DO HOPE AT SOME POINT IN

04:14:08.499 --> 04:14:11.736
THIS -- DISCUSSION THAT WE

04:14:11.803 --> 04:14:16.641
FIGURE OUT -- WHAT'S THE

04:14:16.708 --> 04:14:17.909
STUDENTS ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF

04:14:17.976 --> 04:14:19.544
ALL OF THIS STUFF WE'RE TALKING

04:14:19.611 --> 04:14:21.012
ABOUT TODAY IN OTHER WORDS.

04:14:21.079 --> 04:14:22.814
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO GUARANTEES

04:14:22.880 --> 04:14:24.415
OR NO DISCUSSION.

04:14:24.482 --> 04:14:27.185
OF HOW EITHER PUTTING A CAP. ONE

04:14:27.251 --> 04:14:29.053
CHARTERS OR WHATEVER PROCESS WE

04:14:29.120 --> 04:14:30.855
HAVE WILL BENEFIT THOSE STUDENTS

04:14:30.922 --> 04:14:32.190
WHO ARE WHO ARE REMAINING IN

04:14:32.256 --> 04:14:33.558
PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR WHO MAY BE

04:14:33.625 --> 04:14:34.859
FORCED TO GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL.

04:14:34.926 --> 04:14:35.893
IF THAT HAPPENS TO BE A

04:14:35.960 --> 04:14:38.997
SITUATION WHERE THEIR CHART IS

04:14:39.063 --> 04:14:40.431
CLOSE TO WHAT HAPPENED.

04:14:40.498 --> 04:14:41.566
THESE PANTS THOUGH SINCE OF

04:14:41.633 --> 04:14:42.734
DESPERATION AND I THINK MOST OF

04:14:42.800 --> 04:14:43.768
YOU SINCE THAT.

04:14:43.835 --> 04:14:46.704
THAT -- AND AND AND I THINK IT'S

04:14:46.771 --> 04:14:49.207
IT'S WRONG TO TRY TO CONNECT --

04:14:49.273 --> 04:14:50.875
THE PROLIFERATION OF CHARTERS

04:14:50.942 --> 04:14:53.244
WITH THE LIMITED -- OUTCOMES IN

04:14:53.311 --> 04:14:55.480
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE IF SO

04:14:55.546 --> 04:14:57.415
THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY

04:14:57.482 --> 04:14:58.016
SAYING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

04:14:58.082 --> 04:15:00.318
GUARANTEE THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE

04:15:00.385 --> 04:15:01.886
GOING TO DO BETTER GET BETTER

04:15:01.953 --> 04:15:03.287
FOR KIDS AS A RESULT OF ALL THIS

04:15:03.354 --> 04:15:04.355
WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

04:15:04.422 --> 04:15:06.057
AND AND I DON'T THINK THE

04:15:06.124 --> 04:15:08.459
EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EVEN BEFORE

04:15:08.526 --> 04:15:08.993
CHARTERS.

04:15:09.060 --> 04:15:10.461
WITH A TO PLACE TWENTY FIVE

04:15:10.528 --> 04:15:12.930
YEARS AGO THE SYSTEMS CONTINUE

04:15:12.997 --> 04:15:15.400
TO FAIL AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS.

04:15:15.466 --> 04:15:18.069
AND AND SO I I I UNDERSTAND THE

04:15:18.136 --> 04:15:19.937
NEED FOR SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO

04:15:20.004 --> 04:15:21.472
HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE GROWTH IN

04:15:21.539 --> 04:15:23.608
THE LACK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL

04:15:23.675 --> 04:15:25.443
AND I'M NOT A LOT OF OVERSIGHT

04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.977
THAT.

04:15:26.044 --> 04:15:29.547
THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN THAT

04:15:29.614 --> 04:15:30.114
HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING AND I

04:15:30.181 --> 04:15:31.082
DON'T.%

04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:31.716
I DON'T EVEN AYE LESSER TO SEE

04:15:31.783 --> 04:15:32.717
THE OVERSIGHT COMING IN THIS AND

04:15:32.784 --> 04:15:33.685
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEEN

04:15:33.751 --> 04:15:35.186
SOMETHING IN ALL OF THIS THAT

04:15:35.253 --> 04:15:36.754
REALLY MADE A COMMITMENT.

04:15:36.821 --> 04:15:38.823
OF OVERSIGHT AND OUTCOMES FOR

04:15:38.890 --> 04:15:39.791
KIDS WHO ARE POOR.

04:15:39.857 --> 04:15:41.092
BUT IF WE'RE TAKING THE MONEY

04:15:41.159 --> 04:15:42.393
AND PUTTING IT BACK INTO AND

04:15:42.460 --> 04:15:43.361
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

04:15:43.428 --> 04:15:45.029
FINANCIAL PIECE ISN'T CONCERNED

04:15:45.096 --> 04:15:45.897
ABOUT THOSE THINGS WHICH WE

04:15:45.963 --> 04:15:46.698
SHOULD BE.

04:15:46.764 --> 04:15:48.066
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THINGS ARE NOT

04:15:48.132 --> 04:15:50.334
GOING RIGHT AT THIS POINT FOR A

04:15:50.401 --> 04:15:51.669
LOT OF KIDS AND WE'RE YOUR

04:15:51.736 --> 04:15:53.337
FORTUNE IN SACRAMENTO TO THE

04:15:53.404 --> 04:15:54.172
FOURTEEN SCHOOLS.

04:15:54.238 --> 04:15:56.474
BUT THAT THE PERFORMANCE IS UP

04:15:56.541 --> 04:15:57.842
AND DOWN THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

04:15:57.909 --> 04:16:00.611
AND WE DON'T SEEM TO BE.

04:16:00.678 --> 04:16:02.980
AGGRESSIVELY DEALING WITH THAT

04:16:03.047 --> 04:16:04.682
WE SEEM TO DEAL MORE WITH --

04:16:04.749 --> 04:16:06.617
FINANCES AND MANAGEMENT AND ALL

04:16:06.684 --> 04:16:07.452
THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND WE

04:16:07.518 --> 04:16:09.454
KNOW WHEN SCHOOLS HAVE DONE

04:16:09.520 --> 04:16:14.292
EXTREMELY WELL FINANCIALLY.

04:16:14.358 --> 04:16:15.493
BLACK AND BROWN HE'S STILL FAIL.

04:16:15.560 --> 04:16:17.628
WHEN THEY LOST MONEY BLACK AND

04:16:17.695 --> 04:16:18.129
BROWN KIDS STILL FAIL?

04:16:18.196 --> 04:16:18.930
SO EVEN AS WE DO THIS WE HAVEN'T

04:16:18.996 --> 04:16:20.732
MADE A COMMITMENT TO WHAT WE'RE

04:16:20.798 --> 04:16:22.633
DOING AND ATTACHING IT IN SOME

04:16:22.700 --> 04:16:23.334
WAY.

04:16:23.401 --> 04:16:24.802
THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO

04:16:24.869 --> 04:16:26.370
GET BETTER FOR OUR KIDS I THINK

04:16:26.437 --> 04:16:28.005
THOSE ON THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE

04:16:28.072 --> 04:16:29.474
TO COMMIT OURSELVES AFTER THESE

04:16:29.540 --> 04:16:30.475
THREE BILLS.

04:16:30.541 --> 04:16:32.643
AND ALL THE OTHER ONES WE SEE TO

04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:33.878
REALLY TALK ABOUT.

04:16:33.945 --> 04:16:35.646
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MAJORITY

04:16:35.713 --> 04:16:37.215
OF KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

04:16:37.281 --> 04:16:38.683
KNOWLEDGE TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

04:16:38.750 --> 04:16:39.984
BUT WHAT ACT WHERE I KIDS

04:16:40.051 --> 04:16:42.253
FLEEING WHAT A PAN STILL SO

04:16:42.320 --> 04:16:45.389
DESPERATE.

04:16:45.456 --> 04:16:46.891
UP I MEAN IT.

04:16:46.958 --> 04:16:48.593
I UNDERSTAND IT THE WORST YOU

04:16:48.659 --> 04:16:49.360
KNOW IN TERMS OF THE DECISIONS

04:16:49.427 --> 04:16:50.561
PARENTS HAVE TO MAKE ABOUT

04:16:50.628 --> 04:16:51.763
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH THEIR

04:16:51.829 --> 04:16:52.263
KIDS THESE THESE FOLKS A

04:16:52.330 --> 04:16:53.231
DESPERATE.

04:16:53.297 --> 04:16:54.932
AND AND SO AND THEN AT THE SAME

04:16:54.999 --> 04:16:57.368
TIME WE BUT WE SAT BACK AND KIND

04:16:57.435 --> 04:16:58.870
OF ALLOW THE CHARTER TEAM TO GO

04:16:58.936 --> 04:17:00.304
UP AND DOWN TO GIVE WEEKLY

04:17:00.371 --> 04:17:01.105
WAGGLE YOU.

04:17:01.172 --> 04:17:01.839
GET SOME THINGS OF THAT

04:17:01.906 --> 04:17:03.608
SHOULDN'T BE THERE THAT WE GET

04:17:03.674 --> 04:17:04.208
TO TOSS OUT AND WE'VE HAD TO

04:17:04.275 --> 04:17:04.942
DRESS.

04:17:05.009 --> 04:17:06.477
BUT I'M HOPING AT SOME POINT

04:17:06.544 --> 04:17:08.613
THAT THOSE WERE PUT FORTH THESE

04:17:08.679 --> 04:17:09.647
THREE FOUR BILLS.

04:17:09.714 --> 04:17:10.548
THAT WOULD DRAMATICALLY CHANGE

04:17:10.615 --> 04:17:13.050
CHARTERS ALSO WE'LL TALK ABOUT.

04:17:13.117 --> 04:17:15.253
WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET SOME

04:17:15.319 --> 04:17:17.889
ACCOUNTABILITY? FOR PERFORMANCE

04:17:17.955 --> 04:17:19.423
INTEREST IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM

04:17:19.490 --> 04:17:21.492
BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST CLAMP DOWN

04:17:21.559 --> 04:17:22.493
THIS AND THINK EVERYTHING'S

04:17:22.560 --> 04:17:24.061
GONNA BE OKAY BECAUSE IT WILL

04:17:24.128 --> 04:17:24.729
NOT.

04:17:24.796 --> 04:17:26.030
AND SO I HOPE THAT BECOMES A

04:17:26.097 --> 04:17:30.334
PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE

04:17:30.401 --> 04:17:31.469
REALLY START TALKING ABOUT.

04:17:31.536 --> 04:17:32.103
PERFORMANCE AND WHAT WE NEED TO

04:17:32.170 --> 04:17:33.204
DO FOR OUR KIDS FOR EVERY KID IN

04:17:33.271 --> 04:17:35.473
CALIFORNIA TO GROW AND TO THRIVE.

04:17:35.540 --> 04:17:37.041
AND IF NOT WE'RE GOING TO

04:17:37.108 --> 04:17:38.643
BASICALLY PUSH OUR FOLKS OUT

04:17:38.709 --> 04:17:39.710
AGAIN.

04:17:39.777 --> 04:17:41.245
OUT OF FRUSTRATION.

04:17:41.312 --> 04:17:42.980
AND MY FEAR IS THAT THEY WILL GO

04:17:43.047 --> 04:17:45.950
INTO THE VOUCHER SITUATION THAT

04:17:46.017 --> 04:17:48.186
WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME

04:17:48.252 --> 04:17:49.720
TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO.

04:17:49.787 --> 04:17:51.455
AND I CHAIRED THE VOUCHER NO ONE

04:17:51.522 --> 04:17:52.123
AS I TOLD YOU THE NO ONE THOUGHT

04:17:52.190 --> 04:17:54.025
TO COMMITTEE AND I STILL WANTED

04:17:54.091 --> 04:17:54.826
TO THIS DAY IF I DID THE RIGHT

04:17:54.892 --> 04:17:55.560
THING.

04:17:55.626 --> 04:17:56.294
BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME

04:17:56.360 --> 04:17:58.262
ASSURANCES MADE AS TO WHAT WAS

04:17:58.329 --> 04:17:59.931
GOING TO HAPPEN IN OUR SCHOOLS.

04:17:59.997 --> 04:18:01.899
IF WE DEFEATED VOUCHERS AND THAT

04:18:01.966 --> 04:18:03.568
INSURANCE WAS NOT LIVED UP TO

04:18:03.634 --> 04:18:04.735
FOR ME IN TERMS WITH PEOPLE

04:18:04.802 --> 04:18:06.871
SHORT ME WHEN I TOOK THAT CHARGE

04:18:06.938 --> 04:18:08.339
TO DO THAT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY.

04:18:08.406 --> 04:18:10.007
SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT

04:18:10.074 --> 04:18:11.576
CONVERSATION WILL RISE TO A

04:18:11.642 --> 04:18:12.610
DIFFERENT LEVEL OF

04:18:12.677 --> 04:18:13.978
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE

04:18:14.045 --> 04:18:14.912
PERFORMANCE.

04:18:14.979 --> 04:18:16.747
IN ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS SO THAT WE

04:18:16.814 --> 04:18:18.749
CAN BE PROUD OF CALIFORNIA

04:18:18.816 --> 04:18:20.918
SCHOOLS AND AND AND BOTH RUNNING

04:18:20.985 --> 04:18:22.353
TO CHART IS IS JUST A SYMPTOM.

04:18:22.420 --> 04:18:24.789
OF OUTCOME OF OF WHAT WE SEE AND

04:18:24.856 --> 04:18:26.157
WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE REAL

04:18:26.224 --> 04:18:28.526
ISSUE WHICH IS EVERY SCHOOL IN

04:18:28.593 --> 04:18:29.727
THIS STATE SHOULD BE AN

04:18:29.794 --> 04:18:31.362
EXCELLENT SCHOOL SO THE PARENT

04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:32.964
CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET AND PUT

04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:34.498
THEIR KID IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL.

04:18:34.565 --> 04:18:39.570
AND FEEL THAT'S A GOOD THING AND

04:18:39.637 --> 04:18:40.838
AS A GRANDMOTHER YOU KNOW I MY

04:18:40.905 --> 04:18:42.306
DAUGHTER PAYS ALMOST FORTY

04:18:42.373 --> 04:18:42.940
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR HER

04:18:43.007 --> 04:18:43.441
TWO KIDS GO TO SCHOOL.

AND FOR THOSE LOCAL ENTITIES TO

04:25:23.474 --> 04:25:24.975

PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO ALL PUBLIC

04:25:27.144 --> 04:25:29.079

IN THE FORMER SUPERINTENDENT OF

THE NEW LAW SCHOOL DISTRICT.

04:25:49.166 --> 04:25:50.634
GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS GAIL

04:25:50.701 --> 04:25:52.169
GARBARINO MOJICA AND I'M THE

04:25:52.236 --> 04:25:53.771
PLASTER COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF

04:25:53.837 --> 04:25:55.873
SCHOOLS AND FOR THE PAST TEN

04:25:55.939 --> 04:25:57.708
YEARS WE HAVE HAD A NEW NUMEROUS

04:25:57.775 --> 04:25:58.442
AMOUNTS.

04:25:58.509 --> 04:26:00.077
OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WERE

04:26:00.144 --> 04:26:03.447
LOCATING IN OTHER DISTRICTS THAT

04:26:03.514 --> 04:26:04.982
WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY THEM.

04:26:05.049 --> 04:26:07.785
WE ARE AS A COUNTY OF ABOUT

04:26:07.851 --> 04:26:08.886
SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND KIDS

04:26:08.952 --> 04:26:10.387
SIXTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

04:26:10.454 --> 04:26:11.555
TWENTY ONE CHARTER SCHOOLS.

04:26:11.622 --> 04:26:13.724
AT ONE POINT WE HAD SIX CHARTER

04:26:13.791 --> 04:26:15.192
SCHOOLS THAT WERE OPERATING

04:26:15.259 --> 04:26:16.927
OUTSIDE OF THEIR AUTHORIZES

04:26:16.994 --> 04:26:18.062
BOUNDARIES.

04:26:18.128 --> 04:26:19.663
BASED UPON MY EXPERIENCE THESE

04:26:19.730 --> 04:26:22.099
LAST TEN YEARS I'VE COME ACROSS

04:26:22.166 --> 04:26:23.667
TO TRANSIT I FIND TROUBLING WHEN

04:26:23.734 --> 04:26:25.402
WE HAVE A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT

04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:27.204
RELOCATES OUTSIDE AN AUTHOR

04:26:27.271 --> 04:26:28.839
RISERS BORDERS.

04:26:28.906 --> 04:26:30.407
THE FIRST ONE HAPPENS IS WHEN WE

04:26:30.474 --> 04:26:31.775
DON'T HAVE A GOOD GOVERNMENT

04:26:31.842 --> 04:26:34.311
SYSTEM A LOCAL CONTROL SYSTEM.

04:26:34.378 --> 04:26:35.579
WE HAVE A VERY LARGE CHARTER

04:26:35.646 --> 04:26:36.914
SCHOOL THAT'S LOCATED IN

04:26:36.980 --> 04:26:38.115
ROSEVILLE.

04:26:38.182 --> 04:26:39.016
AND THERE WERE SOME INGRESS

04:26:39.083 --> 04:26:41.018
EGRESS ISSUES THAT HAVE IMPACTED

04:26:41.085 --> 04:26:42.219
THE BUSINESS AND THE COMMUNITY

04:26:42.286 --> 04:26:43.287
MEMBERS.

04:26:43.354 --> 04:26:44.521
THE BUSINESS IN THE COMMUNITY

04:26:44.588 --> 04:26:45.389
MEMBERS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE

04:26:45.456 --> 04:26:47.157
TAKING THEIR CONCERNS TO THEIR

04:26:47.224 --> 04:26:49.326
LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS THEIR

04:26:49.393 --> 04:26:50.394
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS.

04:26:50.461 --> 04:26:51.995
YOUR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS THERE

04:26:52.062 --> 04:26:53.163
CITY GOVERNMENT.

04:26:53.230 --> 04:26:54.331
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT WASN'T

04:26:54.398 --> 04:26:56.900
THE CASE THEY WERE AUTHORIZED BY

04:26:56.967 --> 04:26:58.635
A TOWN THAT WAS TO SCHOOL

04:26:58.702 --> 04:26:59.870
DISTRICTS AWAY.

04:26:59.937 --> 04:27:01.572
FROM THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE A

04:27:01.638 --> 04:27:03.273
TOWN THAT HAD A SCHOOL BOARD

04:27:03.340 --> 04:27:04.608
THAT DID NOT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS

04:27:04.675 --> 04:27:06.377
WITH THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE THE

04:27:06.443 --> 04:27:07.978
SCHOOL BOARD OR THE CAST CITY

04:27:08.045 --> 04:27:09.480
GOVERNMENT.

04:27:09.546 --> 04:27:11.148
IT RESULTED IN MANY CONSTITUENTS

04:27:11.215 --> 04:27:13.317
BEING VERY CONFUSED AS TO HOW

04:27:13.384 --> 04:27:15.018
THEY CAN CONFIRM CONVEY THEIR

04:27:15.085 --> 04:27:17.521
CONCERNS REGARDING THE INGRESS

04:27:17.588 --> 04:27:18.922
AND EGRESS ISSUES.

04:27:18.989 --> 04:27:20.691
THE SECOND ISSUES THAT I'VE COME

04:27:20.758 --> 04:27:25.262
ACROSS IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IS

04:27:25.329 --> 04:27:26.764
THE I DO THE THE PARTICIPATION

04:27:26.830 --> 04:27:28.065
OF MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS SEEKING

04:27:28.132 --> 04:27:29.900
A SMALL AUTHORIZED -- SUCH AS

04:27:29.967 --> 04:27:30.968
ONE OF MY SMALLEST SCHOOL

04:27:31.034 --> 04:27:33.137
DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY LOCATED

04:27:33.203 --> 04:27:34.505
IN THE FOOTHILLS.

04:27:34.571 --> 04:27:35.639
THEY ARE SMALL.

04:27:35.706 --> 04:27:37.508
A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEIR

04:27:37.574 --> 04:27:39.209
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS AND THEY

04:27:39.276 --> 04:27:41.145
DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF STAFF TO

04:27:41.211 --> 04:27:43.747
CONDUCT A IN DEPTH HIGH QUALITY

04:27:43.814 --> 04:27:44.581
REVIEW.

04:27:44.648 --> 04:27:45.816
AS SOON AS SUCH THEY HAVE

04:27:45.883 --> 04:27:48.152
AUTHORIZED MANY LARGE CHARTER

04:27:48.218 --> 04:27:50.254
SCHOOLS SOME OF WHICH THREE OF

04:27:50.320 --> 04:27:53.056
THEM ARE LOCATED IN TAHOE SIX

04:27:53.123 --> 04:27:55.392
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AWAY FROM THEIR

04:27:55.459 --> 04:27:56.994
CURRENT AUTHORIZED -- SO IF YOU

04:27:57.060 --> 04:27:58.796
DRIVE UP HIGHWAY EIGHTY YOU HAVE

04:27:58.862 --> 04:27:59.730
TO DRIVE THROUGH SIX OTHER

04:27:59.797 --> 04:28:01.498
SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEFORE YOU GET

04:28:01.565 --> 04:28:02.900
TO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS.

04:28:02.966 --> 04:28:04.268
WHAT IS THE SERBS WHAT HAS

04:28:04.334 --> 04:28:05.769
RESULTED IS THE LACK OF

04:28:05.836 --> 04:28:07.638
OVERSIGHT THAT THE SMALL RULE

04:28:07.704 --> 04:28:09.406
SCHOOL DISTRICT HOUSE FOR THESE

04:28:09.473 --> 04:28:11.275
CHARTERS I HAVE WITH WITNESSED

04:28:11.341 --> 04:28:12.476
IT MYSELF?

04:28:12.543 --> 04:28:14.011
THE FACT THAT THIS CHARTERS THIS

04:28:14.077 --> 04:28:15.679
DISTRICT DOESN'T EVEN MEET THE

04:28:15.746 --> 04:28:17.481
BASIC REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN

04:28:17.548 --> 04:28:20.451
LONG WHEN IT COMES TO OVERSIGHT.

04:28:20.517 --> 04:28:22.286
SO I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS AND I

04:28:22.352 --> 04:28:26.457
WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THOSE IN

04:28:26.523 --> 04:28:27.090
DEPTH IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

BOARD DECIDED THAT THE WAY THEY

04:29:36.960 --> 04:29:38.896
WERE GOING TO PROVE THIS WAS BY

04:29:38.962 --> 04:29:40.797
APPROVING MULTIPLE CHARTERS AND

04:29:40.864 --> 04:29:42.065
I HAVE THE SLIDE PRESENTATION

04:29:42.132 --> 04:29:43.901
FROM THE BOARD -- MEETING AT

04:29:43.967 --> 04:29:46.003
THAT TIME MULTIPLE CHARTERS AND

04:29:46.069 --> 04:29:47.237
THEY WOULD GENERATE ONE POINT

04:29:47.304 --> 04:29:50.574
THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND SOLVE

04:29:50.641 --> 04:29:52.109
THEIR FISCAL PROBLEMS -- SO YOU

04:29:52.175 --> 04:29:53.544
CAN IMAGINE THAT.

04:29:53.610 --> 04:29:54.878
ACT AND I WOULD ALSO BE AND THE

04:29:54.945 --> 04:29:56.013
EINSTEIN CHARTER FOUND EACH

WOULD ALSO A SCHOOL DISTRICT.

04:30:04.454 --> 04:30:05.856
BUT THE IMMEDIATELY DECLARED

04:30:05.923 --> 04:30:06.657
THERE WAS NO ROOM IN THE

04:30:06.723 --> 04:30:08.425
DISTRICT AND THEY HAVE TO MOVE

04:30:08.492 --> 04:30:10.627
ELSEWHERE -- AND AND THIS IS

04:30:10.694 --> 04:30:11.795
SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO SAW ON

04:30:11.862 --> 04:30:13.130
THE SMALL DISTRICTS WAS THEY

04:30:13.196 --> 04:30:14.831
MANUFACTURE THE ARGUMENT TO FIT

04:30:14.898 --> 04:30:16.300
THE LOOPHOLE THAT THERE'S NO

04:30:16.366 --> 04:30:18.335
ROOM IN THE DISTRICTS ARE SMALL

04:30:18.402 --> 04:30:23.473
DISTRICT -- SO THE THEY WANT TO

MOVE TO SANTA CLARITA AND THEY

04:30:24.575 --> 04:30:26.843
TRIEDAND THEY FAILED TO OPEN.

BUT THEY DID OPEN THAT FIRST

04:30:28.478 --> 04:30:30.013
YEAR THEY OPENED AN ABANDONED

04:30:30.080 --> 04:30:32.783
SCHOOL IN ACT AND I WOULD ALSO.

04:30:32.849 --> 04:30:34.284

04:30:34.351 --> 04:30:36.753
OF NOT HAVING SPACE A YEAR LATER --

04:30:36.820 --> 04:30:37.821
PRIVATE SCHOOL CAME ON THE

04:30:37.888 --> 04:30:40.223
MARKET IN SANTA CLARITA IN THE

NEW HOUSE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND

04:30:41.625 --> 04:30:42.559
THEY MOVED INTO THAT PRIVATE

04:30:42.626 --> 04:30:44.494
SCHOOL AND OPENED NOT TO SERVE

04:30:44.561 --> 04:30:45.629

THE SCHOOLS IN SANTA CLARITA.

04:30:51.635 --> 04:30:52.302
WE HAD ONE PETITION.

ON SIGNIFICANT FOR SIGNIFICANT

04:31:01.044 --> 04:31:02.946
REASONS AND IF THAT SCHOOL WAS

04:31:03.013 --> 04:31:04.748
OPERATING IN OUR DISTRICT.

04:31:04.815 --> 04:31:06.216
AND HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE

04:31:06.283 --> 04:31:07.784
LACK OF OVERSIGHT THAT WE ARE

04:31:07.851 --> 04:31:08.619
OVERSIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT

04:31:08.685 --> 04:31:11.888
APPLY A FEW YEARS INTO THEIR RUN --

04:31:11.955 --> 04:31:13.657
FIFTH MAC CONDUCTED AN EXTRA

EXTRAORDINARY HOT IT.

04:31:15.158 --> 04:31:16.927

MISMANAGEMENT A COMPLETE LACK OF

04:31:18.996 --> 04:31:20.831
PAPERWORK IN A LOT OF CASES THEY

COULDN'T PROVE THAT THERE WAS

04:31:21.632 --> 04:31:23.066
ANYTHING CRIMINAL GOING ON

04:31:23.133 --> 04:31:24.134
BECAUSE A CONFINED ENOUGH

04:31:24.201 --> 04:31:25.936
RECORDS TO DO THAT.

04:31:26.003 --> 04:31:28.038
AND NEW -- SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS

04:31:28.105 --> 04:31:31.508
COMPLETELY UNABLE. TO OVERSEE

04:31:31.575 --> 04:31:32.943
THAT CHARTER OPERATING OUR

04:31:33.010 --> 04:31:34.344
DISTRICT I THINK MATT HAD

04:31:34.411 --> 04:31:36.380
SEVERELY CRITICIZED AND AFTER

04:42:27.730 --> 04:42:28.731
THE BEST THING I EVER DID.

04:42:28.798 --> 04:42:30.433

TO RECONSIDER -- AND IN MANY

05:12:14.515 --> 05:12:16.217
CASES THERE THERE IS A LAB LEVEL

05:12:16.284 --> 05:12:18.619
OF KIND OF ABSTINENCE AROUND

05:12:18.686 --> 05:12:20.588
THIS MATTER AND THAT THAT HASN'T

05:12:20.655 --> 05:12:22.156

05:12:23.624 --> 05:12:25.193
OF GOOD GOVERNANCE I MEAN IF YOU

05:12:25.259 --> 05:12:26.561
THINK IF YOU WILL.

05:12:26.627 --> 05:12:27.762
YOU KNOW IT THE SCHOOL BOARD IS

05:12:27.829 --> 05:12:29.764
A MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT AND A

05:12:29.831 --> 05:12:30.898
CITY IS A MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS

05:12:30.965 --> 05:12:32.433
OF THE CITY ABOUT GROW SAID TO

05:12:32.500 --> 05:12:34.802
THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WELL WE

05:12:34.869 --> 05:12:36.170
NEED MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT WE

05:12:36.237 --> 05:12:37.305
DON'T KNOW PLACE TO LOCATED

05:12:37.371 --> 05:12:38.673
WITHIN OUR CITY SO WE'RE

05:12:38.739 --> 05:12:40.208
BUILDING A NEW POLICE DEPARTMENT.

05:12:40.274 --> 05:12:41.542
IN YOUR CITY.

05:12:41.609 --> 05:12:42.477
BUT YOU HAVE NO OVERSIGHT OVER

05:12:42.543 --> 05:12:43.744
IT YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT

05:12:43.811 --> 05:12:44.645
HAPPENS WITH THE COMINGS OR

05:12:44.712 --> 05:12:46.147
GOINGS OF LOGISTICS OR THE

05:12:46.214 --> 05:12:47.482
TRAFFIC AROUND IT I DON'T THINK

05:12:47.548 --> 05:12:48.916
VERY MANY OF US WHO CARE ABOUT

05:12:48.983 --> 05:12:50.384
LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL GOVERNMENT

05:12:50.451 --> 05:12:51.219
WOULD.

05:12:51.285 --> 05:12:52.920
SUPPORT THAT RIGHT AND SO WE

05:12:52.987 --> 05:12:55.256
NEED TO RESTORE THIS IDEA OF THE

05:12:55.323 --> 05:12:57.225
JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF A

05:12:57.291 --> 05:12:58.226
SCHOOL BOARD AND THAT'S WHAT WAS

05:12:58.292 --> 05:13:03.898
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME TO MAKE

05:13:03.965 --> 05:13:04.499
SURE THAT WE CRAFTED THIS IN A

05:13:04.565 --> 05:13:05.066
WAY.

05:13:05.133 --> 05:13:05.833
AT THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS

05:13:05.900 --> 05:13:06.501
ASSOCIATION WAS ON BOARD BECAUSE

05:13:06.567 --> 05:13:07.168
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF

05:13:07.235 --> 05:13:07.735
PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF

05:13:07.802 --> 05:13:09.170
CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED

05:14:31.085 --> 05:14:31.652
THERE'S A SEPARATE VERSION OF

05:14:31.719 --> 05:14:32.820

05:39:48.835 --> 05:39:50.470
YOUR POPULATION VIETNAMESE COME

05:39:50.536 --> 05:39:51.938
I MEAN ARE YOU LOOKING.

05:39:52.004 --> 05:39:52.839
YEAH ARE YOU LOOKING AT

05:39:52.905 --> 05:39:55.675
ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF DOING IT

05:39:55.742 --> 05:39:56.576
OTHER THAN JUST.

05:39:56.642 --> 05:39:58.044
I DON'T THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE

05:39:58.111 --> 05:39:59.112
TO TRY TO FIND BILINGUAL

05:39:59.178 --> 05:40:00.680
TEACHERS OBVIOUSLY.

05:40:00.747 --> 05:40:02.014
AND IF EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE A

05:40:02.081 --> 05:40:03.449
BILINGUAL TEACHER THAT'S A REAL

05:40:03.516 --> 05:40:06.185
CHALLENGE -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN

05:40:06.252 --> 05:40:08.054
SOME GERMAN PROGRAMS WHERE.

05:40:08.121 --> 05:40:08.988
WHERE WHERE THERE'S A TRADE OFF

05:40:09.055 --> 05:40:11.124
EVERY EVERY WEEK IN SO THAT ONLY

05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:12.391
HALF OF THE STAFF AS THE HIT

05:40:12.458 --> 05:40:13.793
SPEAK GERMAN AND THEY DO

05:40:13.860 --> 05:40:14.927
EXTREMELY WELL?

05:40:14.994 --> 05:40:16.596
YOU KNOW SO THAT I THINK BECAUSE

05:40:16.662 --> 05:40:17.997
I THINK IT DELAYS US TO KEEP

05:40:18.064 --> 05:40:19.699
THINKING THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IT

05:40:19.766 --> 05:40:22.568
A A A TEACHER WHO SPEAKS TWO

05:40:22.635 --> 05:40:24.036
LANGUAGES IN EVERY CLASSROOM.

05:40:24.103 --> 05:40:26.339
AND DOG I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE

05:40:26.405 --> 05:40:28.207

EVERY OTHER WEEK ONE WEEK THEY

05:40:32.912 --> 05:40:34.180
WERE WITH THE GERMAN TEACHER THE

05:40:34.247 --> 05:40:35.248
NEXT WEEK THEY WERE WITH THE

05:40:35.314 --> 05:40:36.682
ENGLISH SPEAKING TEACHER AND THE

05:40:36.749 --> 05:40:38.284
REALITY WAS THAT IF THEY ONLY

WE WOULD BE AVOIDING A LOT OF

05:46:22.361 --> 05:46:23.162
THE ALL THESE PROBLEMS THAT

05:46:23.229 --> 05:46:24.630
YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY IF

THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

05:46:30.202 --> 05:46:31.003
CALIFORNIA.

05:46:31.070 --> 05:46:32.938
THIS BILL THAT I AM PRESENTING

05:46:33.005 --> 05:46:34.840
IT PROPOSES A ROAD MAP TO GET

05:46:34.907 --> 05:46:36.675
CALIFORNIA BACK TO WHERE WE USED

05:46:36.742 --> 05:46:37.343

05:46:37.409 --> 05:46:38.844
AMONG THE TOP TEN IN THE NATION

05:46:48.220 --> 05:46:49.388
WHERE YOU LIVE.

05:46:49.455 --> 05:46:50.322
THERE ARE THREE MAIN POINTS THAT

05:46:50.389 --> 05:46:52.758
I WANT TO BRIEFLY EMPHASIZE

05:46:52.825 --> 05:46:54.760
BEFORE TURN OVER TO MY MY

05:46:57.196 --> 05:46:58.564
BUT THE FIRST POINT I'D LIKE TO

05:46:58.631 --> 05:47:00.166
EMPHASIZE IS THAT THIS IS NOT A

05:47:00.232 --> 05:47:03.002
NEW IDEA WE DID THIS BEFORE WHEN

05:47:03.068 --> 05:47:05.237

CUTS THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO MAKE

05:47:27.326 --> 05:47:28.694
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION.

05:47:28.761 --> 05:47:31.030
GOVERNOR BROWN PUSHED THOSE --

NOT AN APPROPRIATION WE ALL KNOW

05:48:23.949 --> 05:48:24.817
THAT THE SCHOOL FUNDING IS

05:48:24.883 --> 05:48:25.884
ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY THE

05:48:25.951 --> 05:48:27.486
BUDGET BILL THAT WE PASSED EVERY

05:48:33.959 --> 05:48:36.895
DELIBERATIONS THIS BILL DOES NOT

PARTICULAR MESSAGE SAYS NOTICES

06:18:51.775 --> 06:18:52.709
ALTER THE CONTENT OF THEIR

06:18:52.776 --> 06:18:57.481
SPEECHES COMPELLED SPEECH SO.

06:18:57.548 --> 06:19:00.350
I HOW WOULD YOU DO WITH THIS

06:19:00.417 --> 06:19:01.585
THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS IS

FLU DECISION -- SO THERE'S A

06:19:07.191 --> 06:19:07.791
COUPLE THINGS GOING ON HERE THAT

06:19:07.858 --> 06:19:08.392
ARE FOR TO KNOW FIRST OF ALL

06:19:08.459 --> 06:19:08.959
THERE'S NO COMPELLED SPEECH

06:19:11.161 --> 06:19:11.361
ID CARDS.

06:19:11.428 --> 06:19:12.463
SO THAT ALONE OBVIATES THE ISSUE

06:19:12.529 --> 06:19:13.063
THE SECOND PART OF THIS IS WE

06:19:13.130 --> 06:19:13.864
ACTUALLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH

06:19:13.931 --> 06:19:14.398

06:19:24.808 --> 06:19:25.375
THE BILL THEY THINK THAT THERE'S

06:19:25.442 --> 06:19:26.477
VERY VERY CLEAR DISTINCTIONS

06:19:26.543 --> 06:19:26.944
BETWEEN.

06:19:27.010 --> 06:19:27.845

OKAY SO I I GUESS.

06:19:39.256 --> 06:19:40.190
THE WAY I MIGHT TAKE SOME ISSUE

06:19:40.257 --> 06:19:41.391
WITH THAT IS IF THE SCHOOL IS

06:19:41.458 --> 06:19:42.559
REQUIRED THE STUDENTS WHERE THE

06:19:42.626 --> 06:19:42.759
IDEA.

AND THERE'S SPEECH ON THE ID

06:19:43.760 --> 06:19:45.762

06:19:45.829 --> 06:19:49.133
BELIEF OF THE STUDENTS DO YOU

06:34:31.347 --> 06:34:32.615
TO CHANGE THIS SCHOOL TO PRISON

06:34:32.682 --> 06:34:34.484
PIPELINE -- CULTURE THAT'S BEEN

06:34:34.550 --> 06:34:36.419
CREATED OVER MANY DECADES

06:34:36.486 --> 06:34:36.953
UNFORTUNATELY WE NEED MORE

06:34:37.020 --> 06:34:38.755
COUNSELORS BUT OPERATIONAL

06:34:38.821 --> 06:34:40.857
NURSES AND MORE TEACHERS IN THE

06:34:40.923 --> 06:34:41.824
SCHOOLS BEFORE WE REQUIRE --

06:34:41.891 --> 06:34:42.859
THEM TO HAVE MORE SECURITY

06:34:42.925 --> 06:34:44.927
OFFICERS SO JUST RESPECTFULLY I

06:34:44.994 --> 06:34:53.236
WON'T GO TO SUPPORT YOU TODAY

06:34:53.302 --> 06:34:55.338
BUT STILL PUSHING.

06:34:55.405 --> 06:34:57.140
THANK YOU MISTER CARTER.

06:34:57.206 --> 06:34:58.107

06:34:59.242 --> 06:35:00.309
YOUR DIALOGUE IN YOUR HISTORY

06:35:00.376 --> 06:35:01.244
TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS

06:35:01.310 --> 06:35:02.245
SOMETHING THAT YOU.

06:35:02.311 --> 06:35:02.912
HAVE WORK WITHIN YOUR PRIOR LIFE

06:35:02.979 --> 06:35:04.247
AND I'M HAVING A TOUGH TIME

06:35:04.313 --> 06:35:05.181
ESPECIALLY AFTER LAST BILL.

06:35:05.248 --> 06:35:05.782
WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR

06:35:05.848 --> 06:35:07.450
MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

06:35:07.517 --> 06:35:08.684
IN OUR SCHOOLS AND THEY AND THE

06:35:08.751 --> 06:35:10.019
COUNSELOR RATIO IS IS --

06:35:10.086 --> 06:35:11.020
DISGRACE AND YOU KNOW IT'S

06:35:11.087 --> 06:35:11.954
GETTING WORSE IN SOME DISTRICTS

06:35:12.021 --> 06:35:13.890
THEY'RE ACTUALLY LAYING OFF

06:35:13.956 --> 06:35:14.323
COUNSELORS IN THESE

06:35:14.390 --> 06:35:14.991
PROFESSIONALS AND YOU KNOW I SAW

06:35:15.058 --> 06:35:16.826
A BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE HERE AT

06:35:16.893 --> 06:35:18.161
THE CAPITOL FEW WEEKS AGO THE

06:35:18.227 --> 06:35:18.995
SIGNS AND THEY SAID WHAT THEY

06:35:19.062 --> 06:35:20.263
WANTED MORE COUNSELORS NOT

06:35:20.329 --> 06:35:22.365
SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND SO.

06:35:22.432 --> 06:35:22.899
I THINK IT'S HARD WITH A

06:35:22.965 --> 06:35:23.800
STRAIGHT FACE AND TALK TO THEM

06:35:23.866 --> 06:35:24.534
AND SUPPORT THEM.

06:35:24.600 --> 06:35:25.468
AT THE SAME TIME.

06:35:25.535 --> 06:35:26.702
FOCUS ON THIS BUT I WILL NOTE

06:35:26.769 --> 06:35:29.672
THAT -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

06:35:29.739 --> 06:35:31.040
BEAUTIES OF LCF AFTER FRANKLY

06:35:31.107 --> 06:35:31.841
NOT ENOUGH MONEY AS WE KNOW

06:35:31.908 --> 06:35:33.342
WE'RE STILL FORTY FIRST NATION

06:35:33.409 --> 06:35:35.144
FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS WAS THAT.

06:35:35.211 --> 06:35:36.646
IT'S UP TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES IF

06:35:36.712 --> 06:35:38.114
THEY THINK THIS IS A PRIORITY.

06:35:38.181 --> 06:35:40.383
THEY CERTAINLY CAN CAN STEP UP

06:35:40.450 --> 06:35:42.652
AND FOCUS THEIR THEIR RESOURCES

06:35:42.718 --> 06:35:45.421
HERE -- I DO APPRECIATE YOUR

06:35:45.488 --> 06:35:46.622
EFFORT TO TAKE IT OUT OF THAT

06:35:46.689 --> 06:35:49.158
MOVIE TO MANDATE BUT IT'S IT ONE

06:35:49.225 --> 06:35:51.527
MORE DOLLAR GOING TO PAY A STATE

06:35:51.594 --> 06:35:53.029
MANDATE WHETHER I'LL SET UP OR

06:35:53.096 --> 06:35:54.564
NOT HE'S IS A DOLLAR THAT WE

06:35:54.630 --> 06:35:56.232
WON'T HAVE. TO TO POTENTIALLY

06:35:56.299 --> 06:35:57.567
OVER APPROPRIATE NINETY EIGHT I

06:35:57.633 --> 06:35:58.868
MEAN MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE WE

06:35:58.935 --> 06:36:05.141
ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH NINETY

06:36:05.208 --> 06:36:07.243
IT SHOULDN'T BE.

06:36:07.310 --> 06:36:08.811
SHOULDN'T BE -- YOU KNOW.

06:36:08.878 --> 06:36:10.713
THE END ALL THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS

06:36:10.780 --> 06:36:12.415
ON OVER A PER PER OVER

06:36:12.482 --> 06:36:13.149
APPROPRIATING SO.

06:36:13.216 --> 06:36:14.450
IT DOES PUT PRESSURE ON US IN

06:36:14.517 --> 06:36:15.818
HERE IS THAT -- I DON'T THINK

06:36:15.885 --> 06:36:19.489
OUR PURPOSE SO -- I WILL BE ABLE

06:36:19.555 --> 06:36:22.058
TO SUPPORT IT THANK YOU.

06:36:22.125 --> 06:36:23.092
THANK YOU.

06:36:23.159 --> 06:36:24.327
FOR IT LET ME SEE IF I'M IF I'M

06:36:24.393 --> 06:36:25.695
CLEAR ON THIS THIS BEGAN

06:36:25.761 --> 06:36:27.130
ORIGINALLY AS A MANDATE.

06:36:27.196 --> 06:36:28.798
EVERYBODY HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST.

06:36:28.865 --> 06:36:30.566
ONE NOW IT JUST SAYS THAT IS

06:36:30.633 --> 06:36:31.868
THAT YOU YOU CAN HAVE.

06:36:31.934 --> 06:36:32.535
ONE OR YOU CAN DO IT BUT YOU'RE

06:36:32.602 --> 06:36:33.536
NOT REQUIRED TO DO IT IS THAT

06:36:33.603 --> 06:36:36.405
CORRECT. FOR ASKING THAT -- ALL

06:36:36.472 --> 06:36:36.973
THE CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE

06:36:37.039 --> 06:36:38.174
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN EVERY SCHOOL

06:36:38.241 --> 06:36:40.343
CAMPUS HAVE AN SRO WHEN THE

06:36:40.409 --> 06:36:41.644
AMENDMENTS THAT WE CHANGE FROM A

06:36:41.711 --> 06:36:44.013
SIMILAR BILL AS TO THE LAST YEAR.

06:36:44.080 --> 06:36:45.348
ARE THOSE PRESENTED BY SOMEONE

06:36:45.414 --> 06:36:46.782
JAMES GALLAGHER WAS THE S. R. O.

06:36:46.849 --> 06:36:48.451
COULD BE ARMED OR UNARMED IT

06:36:48.518 --> 06:36:49.418
WOULD BE UP TO THE SCHOOL

06:36:49.485 --> 06:36:51.087
DISTRICTS OF WHETHER OR NOT.

06:36:51.154 --> 06:36:53.089
THEY'LL BE.

06:36:53.156 --> 06:36:56.659
CHOOSING A DECIDING SUCH.

06:36:56.726 --> 06:36:58.761
OKAY SO.

06:36:58.828 --> 06:36:59.829
BASICALLY THE RECORD YOUR

06:36:59.896 --> 06:37:02.064
ORIGINAL ONE WAS TO REQUIRE

06:37:02.131 --> 06:37:03.866
THE AMENDMENT SAY IT INTENT TO

06:37:03.933 --> 06:37:04.901
AN URGE SCHOOLS TO CONSIDER

06:37:04.967 --> 06:37:05.835
OVERALL STAFFING LEVELS TO

06:37:05.902 --> 06:37:10.706
ENSURE AB ONE IS NOT THERE

06:37:10.773 --> 06:37:11.841
ANYMORE JUST.

06:37:11.908 --> 06:37:13.009
THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING

06:37:13.075 --> 06:37:16.646
URGED TO CONSIDER IT IS THAT

06:37:16.712 --> 06:37:18.281
CORRECT MISTER CHAIR.

06:37:18.347 --> 06:37:18.748
WELL WE HAVE A DID THE

06:37:18.814 --> 06:37:19.515
AMENDMENTS.

06:37:19.582 --> 06:37:22.919
IT IS A MANDATE. FOR AN SRO PER

06:37:22.985 --> 06:37:27.523
SCHOOL -- SOLIS WAS IN CHARTER

06:37:27.590 --> 06:37:28.291
SCHOOLS.

06:37:28.357 --> 06:37:29.859
IT TO BE CLEAR IT IS A MANDATE

06:37:29.926 --> 06:37:31.994
IT IS A MANDATE OKAY THEN AB I

06:37:32.061 --> 06:37:33.095
THOUGHT IT'D GONE RECOMMENDATION

06:37:33.162 --> 06:37:35.031
THEN I I WOULD MANDATE IT MOST

06:37:35.097 --> 06:37:36.232
OF MY SCHOOLS HAVE AS SORROWS

06:37:36.299 --> 06:37:37.934
BUT I DON'T THINK I WANT TO

06:37:38.000 --> 06:37:39.869
MANDATE THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE --

06:37:39.936 --> 06:37:41.137
ONE I WOULD MIND IF YOU KNOW

06:37:41.204 --> 06:37:43.239
THEY WANT TO CONSIDERED WHICH

06:37:43.306 --> 06:37:45.074
THEY CAN'T AT THIS POINT BUT IT

06:37:45.141 --> 06:37:46.609
BECOMES DIFFICULT TO MANDATE --

06:37:46.676 --> 06:37:48.211
S. ARE ALL WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE

06:37:48.277 --> 06:37:50.413
OTHER THINGS ON CAMPUS SO ANYWAY

06:37:50.479 --> 06:37:51.847
BUT THANK YOU I THOUGHT IT WAS

06:37:51.914 --> 06:37:54.684
HAD BEEN CHANGED SO THIS

06:37:54.750 --> 06:37:56.519
LANGUAGE IS VERY.

06:37:56.586 --> 06:37:57.787
THANK YOU -- I I I THINK YOU FOR

06:37:57.853 --> 06:37:58.554
THE BILL I THINK THERE'S SOME

06:37:58.621 --> 06:37:59.589
THINGS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT

06:37:59.655 --> 06:38:01.190
AS FAR AS LIKE EIGHTY A WHAT IS

06:38:01.257 --> 06:38:02.959
THE ATTENDANCE OF THE SCHOOL.

06:38:03.025 --> 06:38:04.460
AS EVERY SCHOOL REALLY NEED THAT.

06:38:04.527 --> 06:38:06.162
SOME OF OUR LARGER SCHOOLS LIKE

06:38:06.229 --> 06:38:07.830
THE HIGH SCHOOL I CAME FROM HEAD.

06:38:07.897 --> 06:38:08.464
TO OKAY BUT THEY AREN'T ALWAYS

06:38:08.531 --> 06:38:10.066
ON CAMPUS AS WELL I THINK PEOPLE

06:38:10.132 --> 06:38:12.101
NEED TO REALIZE -- THEY'RE OFTEN

06:38:12.168 --> 06:38:13.402
DRIVING AROUND THE CAMPUS

06:38:13.469 --> 06:38:15.238
BECAUSE THINGS HAPPEN AROUND THE

06:38:15.304 --> 06:38:16.272
CAMPUS DURING THE DAY AND

06:38:16.339 --> 06:38:17.773
CERTAINLY THE BEGINNING TODAY

06:38:17.840 --> 06:38:19.742
AND FOR SURE AT THE END OF THE

06:38:19.809 --> 06:38:20.676
DAY.

06:38:20.743 --> 06:38:22.044
SO TO SAY WE DON'T NEED THESE ON

06:38:22.111 --> 06:38:23.613
OUR CAMPUSES AT ALL IS A VERY

06:38:23.679 --> 06:38:25.047
UNDER EDUCATED PERSPECTIVE THAT

06:38:25.114 --> 06:38:26.148
IS SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE

06:38:26.215 --> 06:38:27.283
TRAGEDY.

06:38:27.350 --> 06:38:28.851
THAT WE HAVE SEEN.

06:38:28.918 --> 06:38:30.653
FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL MORE THAN

06:38:30.720 --> 06:38:31.754
ONCE.

06:38:31.821 --> 06:38:35.057
AND I'D LOVE TO THE FACT OF THE

06:38:35.124 --> 06:38:36.959
MATTER IS THAT.

06:38:37.026 --> 06:38:38.060
ACTIVE PRESENCE FROM PLACE RIGHT

06:38:38.127 --> 06:38:40.630
AROUND THE SCHOOL IN PARTICULAR --

06:38:40.696 --> 06:38:41.697
DURING THOSE THOSE THOSE THOSE

06:38:41.764 --> 06:38:43.165
MORE VULNERABLE HOURS BEFORE AND

06:38:43.232 --> 06:38:45.034
AFTER SCHOOL IS VERY VERY

06:38:45.101 --> 06:38:46.636
IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY OF OUR

06:38:46.702 --> 06:38:47.703
STUDENTS.

06:38:47.770 --> 06:38:49.705
AND I THINK HAVING A A AN

06:38:49.772 --> 06:38:51.040
OFFICER ON CAMPUS HELPS A LOT TO

06:38:51.107 --> 06:38:53.109
KNOW IN OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW THEY

06:38:53.175 --> 06:38:54.277
AREN'T THEY THEY ARE.

06:38:54.343 --> 06:38:54.910
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE THE VISION

06:38:54.977 --> 06:38:55.845
THAT IS SOMEHOW WALKING AROUND

06:38:55.911 --> 06:38:57.046
THE CLASSROOMS AND READY TO

06:38:57.113 --> 06:38:57.813
CATCH A BUS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

06:38:57.880 --> 06:38:58.914
PERFORMING ANY DISCIPLINE ON

06:38:58.981 --> 06:39:00.416
CAMPUS UNLESS IT'S PROBABLY SOME

06:39:00.483 --> 06:39:01.550
SERIOUS CRIME.

06:39:01.617 --> 06:39:02.818
BUT VERY RARELY WHAT A POLICE

06:39:02.885 --> 06:39:06.555
OFFICER EVER ENGAGES STUDENTS

06:39:06.622 --> 06:39:07.957
WITH REGARD TO THE TO SOMETHING

06:39:08.024 --> 06:39:09.258
THE STUDENT DID AT SCHOOL AGAIN

06:39:09.325 --> 06:39:10.126
UNLESS IT WERE A SERIOUS CRIME

06:39:10.192 --> 06:39:12.862
SO -- THESE OFFICERS.

06:39:12.928 --> 06:39:14.230
TO PROVIDE SAFETY AT OUR

06:39:14.297 --> 06:39:17.033

EXPECTATION OF FAILURE FAILURE

PERVASIVE IN OUR SCHOOLS AND

06:43:25.681 --> 06:43:26.982

THAT IT SENDS TO BOTH THE

06:43:32.922 --> 06:43:34.590
STUDENTS AND THE PROFESSIONALS

06:43:34.657 --> 06:43:36.158
WORKING WITH THEM.

06:43:36.225 --> 06:43:38.260
IMAGINE OUR STUDENTS ATTENDING

06:43:38.327 --> 06:43:42.064
AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT IS

06:43:42.131 --> 06:43:43.432

06:43:43.499 --> 06:43:44.400
AT RISK.

06:43:44.466 --> 06:43:45.734
RISK IS SOMETHING WE ACTUALLY

06:43:45.801 --> 06:43:47.703
TRY TO AVOID OFTENTIMES IS

06:43:47.770 --> 06:43:49.838

ALL COSTS.

06:43:52.541 --> 06:43:54.209
THIS LABEL SHOULD NOT BE USED TO

DESCRIBE THE POTENTIAL OF OUR

06:43:56.579 --> 06:43:57.846

06:43:57.913 --> 06:44:00.015
BY CHANGING THIS LANGUAGE WE DO

06:44:00.082 --> 06:44:02.618
TWO THINGS. ONE WE'RE SENDING A

06:44:02.685 --> 06:44:04.653
MESSAGE TO PROFESSIONALS WORKING

06:44:04.720 --> 06:44:05.955
WITH STUDENTS THAT WE NEED TO

06:44:06.021 --> 06:44:07.423

EVERY CHILD POSSESSES AND TO

06:44:09.391 --> 06:44:10.292
WE'RE TELLING THE STUDENT THAT

06:44:10.359 --> 06:44:11.427
THEY'RE WORTH IT.

06:44:11.493 --> 06:44:12.861
AND THAT WE BELIEVE IN THEIR

06:44:12.928 --> 06:44:16.165
ABILITY TO SUCCEED WORDS MATTER.

06:44:16.231 --> 06:44:17.166

THE STUDENTS ARE MORE THAN THEIR

06:44:29.244 --> 06:44:30.946
SITUATION AND THEY NEED TO BE

06:44:31.013 --> 06:44:32.114
TREATED AS SUCH.

06:44:32.181 --> 06:44:34.049
