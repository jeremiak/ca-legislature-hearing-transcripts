SIGNIFIES MAKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOANS JUST LIKE OTHER LENDERS TO LOANS TO BUSINESSES ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION IN LOANS MADE BY SIGNIFIES AND TWENTY NINETEEN BALSAM SIGNIFIES ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM THE CUSTOMER'S SIGNIFIES ME ALSO RECEIVED GRANTS AND INVESTMENTS FROM OTHER BANKS AS PART OF THEIR COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS FROM PHILANTHROPIC INSTITUTIONS AND FROM THE US TREASURY CDFI FUND THE STATE PROVIDE SOME FUNDING TO FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND TO CSI'S A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER PUBLIC LOAN PROGRAMS EXIST TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES GET LOANS AND TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS LOAN LENDERS THE FIVE MOST COMMON TYPES OF PROGRAMS ARE LISTED ON PAGES THREE AND FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT AN OFFER THIS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT OUR LOAN GUARANTEES A LOAN GUARANTEE IT'S BEEN A PUBLIC AGENCY AGREES TO PAY THE RENT THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE IN THE EVENT THAT A BORROWER DEFAULTS ON THE LOAN UNDER A LOAN PARTICIPATION PROGRAM A PUBLIC AGENCY DIRECTLY LENDS MONEY TO BUSINESSES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE LENDER UNDER A COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM A PUBLIC AGENCY PLEDGES CASH COLLATERAL FOR BARBERS THAT OTHERWISE LACK A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL I CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM INSURES A PORTFOLIO LOANS INSTEAD OF JUST THE INDIVIDUAL LOANS AND THE LAST PROGRAM ON THE LIST IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS VENTURE CAPITAL PROGRAMS OUR SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO HELPING UNDERSERVED BUSINESS START UPS -- WITH THEIR EQUITY NEEDS WELL NOT LOANS THESE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED GRANTS AND THE PROGRAM EXPECTS TO EARN A RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENTS MOST LOANS WILL BE REPAID OVER TIME AND AS FAR AS REPAY THEIR LOANS THE FUNDS ARE TYPICALLY REDEPLOYED A RECYCLED TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL LENDING ACTIVITY IN THOSE PROGRAMS TURNING NOW TO PAGE FIVE OF A HAND OUT WE THINK IT'S HELPFUL CONTEXT FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MANY PROGRAMS THAT AID SMALL BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS LENDERS THE LARGEST BY FAR IS THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION SEVEN A PROGRAM IT'S A LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM AND IT GUARANTEED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS -- IN ITS PORTFOLIO IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ESPN HAS A VARIETY OF OTHER SMALLER LOAN PROGRAMS AS WELL THAT A MORE TARGETED AND IN ADDITION THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE HAS ON SOME PROGRAMS TO HELP BUSINESSES IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR THE STATE TO HAS LONG OPERATED LEARN PROGRAMS THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER WHICH IS THE STATE'S LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM AND IT'S LOCATED IN I THINK THE EMPHASIS RUPTURED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK WHICH IS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE PRECURSOR TO THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER WORKS WITH SEVEN INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS THAT IN TURN WORK WITH A CURRENTLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE LENDERS ACROSS THE STATE IN NINETEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THIS PROGRAM GUARANTEED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LOANS WORTH AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY THE C. P. CFA IS UNDER THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND THE C. P. C. F. EIGHT MINISTERS A NUMBER OF BOND FUNDED PROGRAMS -- WORK THEY'RE GONNA FOCUS ON TO THE CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES OR CAL CAP AND THE COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM CAL CAP IS A LITTLE PORTFOLIO INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT HAS TWENTY PARTICIPATING LENDERS AND IN TWENTY TWENTY THESE LENDERS AND ROLLED EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY SMALL BUSINESS LOANS TOTALING ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THE COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM CONTRIBUTE CONTRIBUTED I'M SORRY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- IN TWENTY TWENTY IN SUPPORT OF FORTY WOODLANDS SO LET'S TURN NOW TO THE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT A NEW SHIFT S. S. B. C. I. PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN TWENTY TEN UNDER THE US TREASURY WITH ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR STATES TO DEVELOP LOAN PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE SMALL BUSINESS LENDING NEEDS IN THEIR OWN STATES AND THE FIGURE ON PAGE SEVEN SHOWS HOW THESE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED BY THE STATE'S ACROSS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF PROGRAMS YOU'LL SEE THAT LOAN PARTICIPATION AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS WERE THE MOST POPULAR TYPES OF PROGRAM WERE AMONG THE LEAST POPULAR CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TWENTY TEN S. S. B. C. I. PROGRAM AND THESE FUNDS WERE SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN THE SMALL BUSINESS -- FINANCE CENTERS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM AND THE C. P. C. A PHASE CAL CAP AND COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND THESE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THREE TRANCHES BETWEEN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE TABLE ON PAGE EIGHT PROVIDE SOME SUMMARY STATISTICS FOR THE S. B. C. R. PROGRAM OVERALL NATIONALLY AND FOR THE THREE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE STATE CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM SUPPORTED A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNT LOANS THE AVERAGE LOAN WAS ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY CAL CAP PROGRAM ALSO HAS A VERY HIGH LEVERAGE RATIO COMMITTING TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AND PRIVATE FUNDS FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR IN PUBLIC FUNDING IN CONTRAST THE AVERAGE LOAN SUPPORTED BY THE COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM WAS ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND MUCH LARGER AND IT HAD A RELATIVELY LOW LEVERAGE RATIO LESS THAN THREE DOLLARS A PRIVATE FUNDS FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR IN PUBLIC FUNDING THE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE THESE FIGURES IT SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF OF LOANS -- AND AND DOLLAR AMOUNTS THE SPCA EXPIRED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT AS WE KNOW WHY WE HEAR TODAY'S RE AUTHORIZED LAST YEAR IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT THE OTHER SPEAKERS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS A GREAT DEAL SO ALL I'M I'M NOT GOING TO ALL THE DETAILS OF THIS NEW PROGRAM RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS TO KEEP IN MIND FIRST THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE TWENTY TEN S. S. B. C. R. PROGRAMS ONE POINT TWO ALMOST ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION IN THE FIRST FIRST ROUND SO AS BEFORE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED IN THREE TRANCHES AND IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDS THE STATE WILL NEED TO EXPAND EIGHTY PERCENT OF EACH OF THE FIRST AND SECOND TRANCHES AND THEN AS THE STATE IS EXPANDING THESE FUNDS THAT MUST COMPLY WITH OTHER PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS WHICH INCLUDE EXPANDING AT LEAST FORTY NINE PERCENT OF THE FUNDING FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE OWNED BY SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS PRISONERS MAY REFER TO A STUDY OR A CD I -- GRAMS AND -- ALLS AND PROGRAMS THE FUNDS NEED TO BE LEVERAGE FOR TEN DOLLARS AND PRIVATE FUNDING FOR WEBER ONE DOLLAR PUBLIC FUNDING SO TO SOME EXTENT THESE VARIOUS PURPOSES WITH EACH OTHER TURNING TO PAGE TEN WE HAVE SOME -- SOME SOME KEY ISSUES THAT WE THINK -- FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AS YOU -- DEAL WITH THESE THESE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS SO THE FIRST IS THAT IMPROVING ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING A LOAN MAKE IT CHALLENGING TO MEET THE LEVERAGE GOALS AS THE BARS OVER ALL RISK INCREASES THE AMOUNT THAT MUST BE OBLIGATED BY THE PUBLIC AGENCY INCREASES AS WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE'S CORBETT NINETEEN DISASTER RELIEF LOAN PROGRAM REQUIRES THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER TO ENCUMBER ONE DOLLAR FOR EVERY TWO DOLLARS THAT SLOAN BECAUSE THE PERCEIVED RISK OF THESE LENSES HIGHER AND THE S. S. B. C. I. PROGRAMS MAY NEED TO ALLOCATE FUNDING TO PROGRAMS THAT HELP OF HIGH AND LOW LEVERAGE RATIOS TO MEET THAT TEND TO ONE GOAL HOWEVER RATIOS MAY IN SOME INSTANCES PERHAPS COULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR LOANS ON WITHOUT THE AID SECOND THE GOAL TO EXPAND -- OBLIGATE THE FUNDING QUICKLY COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE GOALS THAT HAVE A HIGH LEVERAGE RATIO AND TO HELP SMALLER BORROWERS SO IF WE JUST WANTED TO OBLIGATE THE FUNDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE MIGHT FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE LARGER LOANS ON THREE PROGRAMS WITH VERY LOW LEVERAGE RATIO GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE IT WILL BE CHALLENGING TO OBLIGATE THESE FUNDS QUICKLY WHILE RAMPING UP THOSE PROGRAMS LET CAL CAP THAT -- BENEFITS THE SMALLEST BORROWERS BECAUSE I HAS A VERY HIGH LEVERAGE RATIO IN THE AVERAGE ABOUT SMALL SO FOR THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT YOU'RE DOING -- IT IT DOESN'T USE AS MUCH OF THE FUNDS RELATIVELY SPEAKING TO OTHER PROGRAMS END UP PROGRAMS THAT THESE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT SMALL BOAT BUYERS ARE OFTEN BUSINESSES THAT ARE OWNED BY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS WE THINK THE STATE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WAYS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPAND SUPPORT FOR BOTH LARGE BORROWERS AND PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT SMALL FARMERS BUT WE WILL NEED TO DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME TO MEET ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS THIRD YOU WILL WANT TO CONSIDER YOUR TOLERANCE FOR RISK SO THE DEFAULT RATES IN THE EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN THAT FOR THE SBA'S LOAN PROGRAMS HOWEVER IS THE INFLUX OF SS BCI FUNDING WILL REQUIRE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO TO GROW AND EXPAND THE NUMBER OF OF BUSINESSES THEY SUPPORT HE MADE SUPPORT LEADING TO HIGHER RISK BORROWERS WHO MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR LOANS AT HIGHER RATES AND ULTIMATELY TO THE EXTENT IT'S EXPECTED EXPANSION FOCUSES ON IT CONTINUING TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CREDITS TO CREDIT FOR BORROWERS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY QUALIFYING FOR LOANS A SOMEWHAT HIGHER DEFAULT RATES MAY BE UNAVOIDABLE LASTLY BE MINDFUL THAT THE SPCA PROGRAMS WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO U. S. TREASURY OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS THREE TWENTY THIRTY SO YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HOW YOUR OVERSIGHT OF THESE PROGRAMS AND YOUR POLICY GUIDANCE TO THESE PROGRAMS RELATES THE FEDERAL OVERSIGHT DURING THIS TIME SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU PROBABLY WOULD WANT TO AVOID ADOPTING A REQUIREMENT THAT MIGHT CONFLICT WITH TREASURY GUIDANCE WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT YOU LOOK AHEAD TO TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND AND BEGIN THINKING ABOUT HOW THE FUNDS THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOLLOWING THE REPAYMENT OF THESE LOANS ARE REDEPLOYED AND RECYCLED THROUGHOUT THESE PROGRAMS SO TO THIS END YOU'LL LIKELY WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE TRANSPARENT THEY KEEP GOOD RECORDS AND FOR EXAMPLE AVOID INTERMINGLING STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS TOGETHER AND -- LASTLY -- CONSIDER THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT IF ANY THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ALLOW THESE PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE AS A AT A CERTAIN LEVEL SO IN CONCLUSION YOU WILL WANT TO NOT ONLY THINK ABOUT HOW THE STATE CAN BEST MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SS DCI PROGRAM UP TO THE PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS THE OF THE S. S. B. C. AYE BUT ALSO HOW TO MAXIMIZE AND HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT OF FUNDS BUT ALSO TO STRUCTURE THESE PROGRAMS TO MEET YOUR POLICY OBJECTIVES NOW AND IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU FOR AND ALLOWING US TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING THANK YOU MISTER WEATHERFORD MUCH APPRECIATED I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE THE REMAINDER OF THE PANEL AND THEN FOLLOWED UP WITH THE -- GIVE THE FLOOR TO OUR STATE TREASURER SO JOINING US FOR THE REMAINING OF THE PANEL ON ISSUE ONE IS OUR CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURER FIONA MA AS WELL AS SCOTT WOULD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FOR STRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK OTHERWISE KNOWN AS I THINK AND SHEILA TO BUY IS DANIEL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CP CFA MADAM TREASURE YOU MAY BEGIN OKAY GREAT -- I'VE GOT SOME HANDOUTS GOING AROUND BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NICE TO BE BACK AND TO SEE EVERYONE YEARS OR THE PANDEMIC -- I PERSONALLY DID ABOUT THREE HUNDRED ZOOM WEBINARS -- TRYING TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT ABOUT FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AND ALSO PRIVATE SECTOR RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND SO AS PART OF MY JOB IS A STATE TREASURER AND MANAGING THE CAL CAP PROGRAM WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO MAKING SURE THAT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES I GET THE NEEDED INFORMATION I TOO STARTED OUT AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IS A CPA -- PRESIDENT OF THE ASIAN BUSINESS ASSOCIATION AND THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN PUBLIC SERVICES REPRESENTING WOMEN AND MINORITY SMALL BUSINESSES SO THIS IS STILL VERY -- PASSIONATE PASSIONATE AREA FOR ME AND SOMETHING THAT I FOCUS ON REGARDLESS OF WHAT OPPOSITION I HOLD SO TODAY -- TALKING ABOUT -- THE TREASURE'S OFFICE AND THE AYE BANK TEAMS WE WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER AND WE SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION FOR THE S. S. B. CI A TWENTY TWENTY ONE FUNDING WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CREATED TO STRENGTHEN STATE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT ON THE AT THE ROBUST ON MY TEAM WAS ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE ORIGINAL S.

BANK AND COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS -- THEY REACH THEIR GEAR FOR LARGER LOANS OF LENDERS THAT USE AND TRUST THE PROGRAMS AND FIND ONE OR THE OTHER PROGRAMS TO DOUBLE FOR THEIR NEEDS -- WITH AMOUNTS AND I BANK LENDING THE LARGER AMOUNTS ALL LENDING NEEDS ARE COVERED -- WE LIKE TO THINK THAT OUR LOAN PRODUCTS DON'T COMPETE THEY COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER -- ANOTHER THING THAT I'D LIKE TO ADD IS THAT WE WILL NOT BE COMMINGLED FUNDS WE DO NOT COMMINGLED FUNDS STATE FINE FOR THE KALKASKA ON PROGRAM SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM IT WILL BE CLOSED AND WE WILL ONLY BE DEPLOYING FINDS OUT OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS WHEN THE ACCESS PCI FUNDS ARE DISBURSED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS ENDEAVOR WITH MY COLLEAGUES SCOTT WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER OUR INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT IS -- CONFIGURED SO THAT IT ALLOWS US TO -- WORK AS A WELL OILED MACHINE WE CAN WE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FUNDS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE AGENCIES SO THAT UNDER PERFORMING PROGRAMS MONEY CAN BE ALLOCATED TO THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE PERFORMING TIME SO WE LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS TEAM CALIFORNIA AND TOGETHER AND -- WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN HANDLE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THESE FUNDS AND GET SOME MUCH DESERVED AND NEEDED HELP TO CALIFORNIA'S BIT SMALL BUSINESSES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND AND I REALLY LIKE YOUR APPOINTMENTS SET TO BUY AS DANIEL TEAM CALIFORNIA A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS ON THE DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESSES BASED ON THE NUMEROUS PROGRAMS THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT HAVE SOMEONE MADE TO FIND A SMALL BUSINESSES UNDER ONE HUNDRED UNDER TWENTY FIVE MICROENTERPRISE UNDER FIVE SOME MAY DEFINE IT AS OVER SEVEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES CAN YOU GIVE US A BREAK DOWN AS TO WHAT A SMALL BUSINESSES DEPENDING ON THE PROGRAM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HER OUR REGULATIONS PROGRAM AND THE COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES WITH FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES ARE OR LESS TO A SMALL BUSINESS MAYBE FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES ARTLESS THAT'S THAT'S A LOT OF THAT'S A LOT OF WORKERS -- WHAT IS IS THERE AN AVERAGE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT FOR IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT RECEIVED THE FUNDING THAT WERE MAYBE ONE HUNDRED OR LESS SIR A WAY THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY BUSINESSES ARE HELPED TO GET THOSE NUMBERS FOR YOU I WOULD SAY THAT THE MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS OUR DISTRICTS ARE OUR BEGAN HERE MR LACKEY I HEAR YOU LESS THAN TEN SO BE VERY CURIOUS TO FIND OUT IF YOU CAN PROVIDE US WITH THAT INFORMATION AS TO ALLOCATED AND YOU KNOW HOW WE SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND OUR SMALL BUSINESS QUARTERS ACROSS THE DISTRICT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND I I KNOW THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE DIETS ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS -- I'D LIKE TO TO START WITH -- A TREASURE MY THINK YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S A FIFTY FIFTY SPLIT BETWEEN THE I. BANK IN THE C. P. CFA FUNDS IS THIS A GENERAL PRACTICE OR IS THIS A IS THERE ROOM FOR FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHICH PROGRAM WORKS BEST AS AS BC I WON AS WE CALL IT IT WAS SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY M. THIS TIME WERE ALSO -- WE ALSO APPLY TO SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS THAT WE HAVE AND THE GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH ON THE AYE BANK SO SAID ON THE MO YOU ALLOWS US TO TO AGENCIES TO MOVE MONEY BACK AND FORTH TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE NOT AND I HAVE FOUND DURING THE PANDEMIC THE -- PEOPLE WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH AS A FIRST LANGUAGE HAVE BEEN MISSING OUT ON THE PPP LOANS THE IDOL LOANS ALL THE GRANTS -- OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S FIRST COME FIRST SERVE THEY DON'T TRUST GOVERNMENTS THEY DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO HELP THEM FILL OUT THE APPLICATIONS GET THEIR FINANCES IN ORDER -- AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF OBSTACLES AND BARRIERS TO THE SMALLER MOM AND POP IMMIGRANT OWNED BUSINESSES WHICH WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HELP OUT TO OUT REACH BUT WE LOOK TO ALL OF YOU TO HELP US REACH OUT TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO GET THE WORD OUT THAT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS INTENDED TO HELP THEM TO TRUST US YOU KNOW TO TO DEVELOPMENT CENTERS WHO OFFER FREE CONSULTATION AND ASSISTANCE A SMALL BUSINESSES TO REACH OUT TO THEM TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING THEIR APPLICATIONS TO THESE PARTICIPATING LENDERS THANK YOU FOR THAT IT ACTUALLY BRINGS UP MY A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I THINK ARE TIED TOGETHER AND THAT IS YOUR OUT REACH PLAN WHAT HAS THAT LOOK LIKE -- I THINK IT WAS MR WILL WHO SAID THAT -- APPLICATION SERVER I'M I'M I'M FORGETTING I THINK IT'S ALL BEEN MENTIONED BUT ONLINE APPLICATIONS BUT THE REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LACK OF A DIGITAL DIVIDE IS OR I'M SORRY A REAL DIGITAL DIVIDE IS GETTING IN THE WAY NOT ONLY OF FAMILIES WANTING TAXES SCHOOL FOR THEIR CHILDREN BUT CLEARLY IN A WAY IN WHICH THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACCESS FOR COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET ARE NOT AS SAVVY AND HOW TO APPLY ONLINE THERE'S LANGUAGE BARRIERS AT CETERA SO IN YOUR WORK WITHIN I WOULD IMAGINE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHAT HAS THAT OUT WHICH LOOK LIKE AND WHAT IS THE CONTINUED PLAN MOVING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO BE PART OF AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM IN WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE WE OUTRAGE AND FUND SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE YES SO THIS TIME I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTIES AND THEY HAVE ALLOCATED A CERTAIN AMOUNT I THINK FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SOLD THIS TYPE OF MONEY WILL ALLOW US TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE TO DO THAT PHYSICAL OUT REACHED IN LOOK DIFFERENT LANGUAGES UP PERSONALLY AT MY OFFICE I HAVE AN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS TEAM -- THEY GO OUT AND THEY REACH OUT TO ALL THE DIFFERENT -- YOU KNOW NON PROFITS -- THE THE CHAMBERS THE ROTOR RES -- WHATEVER AFFINITY GROUPS THERE ARE TO TRY TO WORK ON A SMALL BUSINESS -- WEAPON ARE I'VE DONE THAT WITH A NUMBER OF YOU -- WE ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PUTTING IT OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO COME BECOME AVAILABLE WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE AYE BANK ON MANY OF THESE -- OUTREACH SEMINARS IN TERMS OF WHAT PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE WHICH ONES ARE

ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH SO THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY DO SOME SOME FOLLOW UP IN OUR DISTRICTS IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AN POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES OF

TWO NINE SEEMS TO BE A CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF GATHERING DATA AND SO I'M CURIOUS -- WHAT HAS BEEN -- THE WORK AROUND AROUND THAT IF FOR TRYING TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE SUPPORT BUSINESSES OWNED BY WOMEN OF COLOR OR MINORITY COMMUNITIES WHAT HAS BEEN THE THE WAY IN WHICH I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRACK NINE I WAS THERE WHEN IT PASSED AND HAVE BEEN HERE TRYING TO OVERTURN IT BUT -- THAT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY BARRIER IN TERMS OF -- CREATING ACCESS TRACK RIGHT -- WHETHER THEY ARE A BUSINESS OF A CERTAIN SIZE WHETHER THEY ARE LOCATED IN ZIP CODES -- OF UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE TRIED TO USE WHAT

TERRITORIES IN THE DISTRICT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THANK YOU MESCAL IF YOU COULD PLEASE THAT MAKE YOUR INTRODUCTIONS AS WELL SURE HELLO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M ALISON KELLY AND THE CEO OF AYE CA WHERE VENTURE CAPITAL CERTIFIED CDFI IN ONE OF THE TWO PERCENT SLOT THERE THAT THE L. A. O. PRESENTED AND WE ACCELERATE GREAT BUSINESSES THROUGH MENTORING AND INVESTMENTS TO CLOSE THE RACIAL AND GENDER WEALTH GAPS WERE BASED IN OAKLAND AND WE SERVE THE NINE COUNTY BAY AREA REGION I CA IS THE THIRD CDFI WORKED THAT IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS SUPPORTING EXCLUSIVELY SMALL BUSINESSES THE ONE PREVIOUSLY WITH CDC SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE WHICH HAS THE LOAN PORTFOLIO OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS PRIMARILY IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE OWNER OCCUPIED A BUILDING LOANS AND TRANSACTIONS AND I CO FOUNDED THE WISDOM FIND WHICH IS AN EFFORT TO CREATE A LOAN PRODUCT AROUND THE NEEDS OF WOMEN OF COLOR BORROWERS WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT WELL OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM WASN'T CREATED FOR ANYBODY BUT WHITE MEN AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HAVING A MORE INCLUSIVE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND REALLY GETTING THESE PROGRAMS AND DOLLARS INTO THE COMMUNITIES WHO REALLY NEED IT MOST -- WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE DESIGN THESE PROGRAMS DIFFERENTLY I CA WE RECENTLY LAUNCHED A AN IMPACT NOTE WHICH INCLUDES SOCIAL RETURNS AS PART OF THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS INSIDE THE LOAN AT THE FINANCIAL PRODUCT ITSELF I AS A CONVERTIBLE NOTE AND SO THERE ARE MANY MANY WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT PROGRAM SUSTAINABILITY AND RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS AND I AM WANTING TO CONVEY THAT HERE WITH YOU ALL TODAY THANK YOU ALL FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERTISE WITH THE COMMITTEE I WILL BEGIN WITH THE QUESTION FOR THE WHOLE PANEL FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE BUT WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIONS THE STATE CAN TAKE TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE S. S. B. C. I. PROGRAM THE -- I'LL GO FOR OKAY THE FIRST THING IT AND I'M LIKE LISTEN VERY ATTENTIVELY TO THE FIRST PANEL AND I I WANT TO ADDRESS THE AIM OF THE LOAN DEFAULT RATE -- JUST MERELY PUT IT IN ON LEVEL WITH THE NATIONAL LEVEL OF DEFAULT RATE WOULD PUT US IN A BETTER POSITION IN PART BY RE EVALUATING THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE AND -- CAP RIGHT NOW ONE PERCENT IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU REACH SPEED LIMITS IN WHICH YOU WANT TO REACH IN THE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME BRACKET AND INCREASING THE DEFAULT RATE WE HAVE A TOOL THAT WAS MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES THAT HELPS WITH DEFAULT RATES WE KNOW THAT YOU NATIONALLY CAN REDUCE -- DEFAULT RATES BY HAVING A STRONG WORLD US TA -- PROVIDING SYSTEM WITH THAT LONE PARTNER WITH THE LOAN AND WE THINK CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS BEING ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY I THINK IT IS EASY FOR US TO LOOK AT OUR DEFAULT RATE AND ASSESS THE RISKS WE WANT TO TAKE IN GETTING EIGHTY PERCENT OF THIS COMPANY OUT IN THE FIRST TRASH I THINK THAT IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE LOOK AT THAT THE STATE MUST ALSO ENSURE APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE EXIST -- AND -- TO DISPERSE THIS MONEY OFFICIALS EFFECTIVELY AND MAKE IT -- AND QUICKLY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THE RECOVERY OF THE CULVERT -- THE WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PROPER STAFFING WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PROPER STREAMLINING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE ARE DOING THAT REFERRAL YOU KNOW THE -- THE REPRESENTATIVE LACY WAS MENTIONING THE RULE AREAS WE HAVE TOO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATING OUR PLAN WE NEED TO STRUCTURE THAT IN A WAY THAT IS VERY ZERO DAN TWO ONE STOP CAPITAL KIND OF SHOP FOR PEOPLE TO ENTRY AND AND I THINK WE HAVE THAT IN SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT HOW WE ALIGN THAT THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY -- BEFORE PASSING ON TO MY OTHER PANELISTS WE HAVE A LOOK AT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND THE COST OF CAPITAL WE CAN'T PASS THIS ON TO THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND ROLLED IN THESE DEPARTMENTS THAT IN THESE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS WE SHOULD LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO MINIMIZE THE COST OF CAPITAL WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LOANS -- WHEN WE LOOK AT BUSINESSES THAT ARE LESS THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES BUSINESSES THAT ARE REALLY USING EVERY SCRAP OF CAPITAL THEY HAVE SO WE KNOW THAT MICROLOANS FIFTY THOUSAND OR LESS ARE AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE BUT THE BAD LOAN PROBLEM AND LACK OF SERVICES BETWEEN THE FIFTY THOUSAND AND A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND LEVEL THAT IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR OUR TYPICAL COMMERCIAL BANKS TO MAKE THAT LOAN WITH THEIR HIGH PRICE LOAN OFFICERS AN UNDERWRITING PROCESS HOW DO WE SUPPLEMENT THAT AND HOW DO WE USE THAT TO KEEP THE COST OF CAPITAL DOWN IS CRUCIAL IN THIS PROGRAM IF WE ARE GOING TO GO INTO THAT COMMUNITY SEVERAL I WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION FOLLOWING A LOT -- WHAT MY FELLOW PANELISTS JUST MENTION A ROBUST ECOSYSTEM OF SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA AND I HAD THE STATE NEEDS TO LEVERAGE THAT TO REALLY REACH THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE CAPITOL OF THE MONTH I CDFI IS THAT ARE PARTNERING WITH THE STATE AND THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE HAVE PROVEN DIRECTLY TO REALLY REACH THIS COMMUNITIES AND DEPLOY CAPITAL AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE RISK THAT THE STATE IS WILLING TO TAKE TO REALLY REACH STATE THAT THAT THE BUSINESS OWNERS THAT REALLY NEED IT SO WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN DID FULL RATES IS LIKE ARE WE WILLING TO INCREASE THAT THE FULL RATE ARE WE WILLING TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE UNDERWRITING CRITERIA THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ASSESS THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY APPLIES TO THEIR CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES OFFERED TO STAY TO REAL LEVERAGE THAT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE AND ALSO SUPPORT A VERY A STRONG TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROPOSAL WE DID HEAR THAT DADDY IS THE WAY THAT THE OUTRAGE IS GONNA BEAT DELIVERED SO HOW COULD WE REACH HOW COULD THE STATE REALLY BUILD INTO THE ECOSYSTEM AND THE NETWORK THAT -- THEY HAS AND HAD ALREADY EXISTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO REALLY RETURN PROVIDE ALL RIGHTS TO THIS -- COMMUNITIES AND I WOULD LASTLY SAY THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT THE RESOURCE PARTNERS NEED TO BUILD THEIR OWN CAPACITY TO DEPLOY THIS SOUL ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER REALLY AREN'T TAKING A TOLL RIGHT SO EVERYTHING HAS TO COME WITH OUR STRATEGY TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY IT COULD BE THROUGH OBVIOUSLY I'LL REACH FUNDING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS CONSIDER THOSE BAD REALLY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- OLD THEY PARTNERS NEED TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY TO REPORT AT TO RESPOND TO YOUR TASKS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SO BEAUTIFULLY SAID AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE FOLKS THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT IF THERE'S TRUST AND SO USING THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS THAT ARE ALREADY HERE AND DOING THE WORK AND HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS IT'S NOT TRUST THAT REALLY IS GOING TO BE THE MECHANISM TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS REALLY SUCCESSFUL AND THE CAPACITY BUILDING ALONG WITH THE CAPITAL IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL WE HAVE AN ACCELERATOR AND INVESTMENT PRACTICE USING CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND EQUITY INTO BUSINESSES RIGHT INTO THE AREA THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SOMETIMES UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT AN ABLE BEST TO DO THAT IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE ENTREPRENEUR OUTSIDE OF CREDIT SCORES CORRECT OUTSIDE OF ASSET RATIOS NO COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS WHO IS THAT PERSON AND HOW CAN WE INVEST IN THEIR VISION AND THEIR FUTURE AND THEN HELP PROTECT THAT -- THROUGH THE CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE THAT THAT STATE CONSIDER THE STRONG COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS HAVING FOUNDER FRIENDLY FINANCING AND THE COACHING CAPITAL CONNECTIONS THAT IS CRITICAL TO GO ALONG WITH THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS SO MANY TAKEAWAYS I AM SAID TO TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS SIDE LET ME QUICKLY TURN INTO ANY OF -- MY COLLEAGUES FURTHER QUESTIONING ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION I'M STILL IN YES THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THOSE POINTS I'M INCREDIBLY WELL TAKEN AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE POINT AROUND DEFAULT SO YEAH ONE PERCENT DEFAULT RATE MEANS BY DEFINITION WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY REALLY DEPRESSED REACHING ANYONE WHO'S YOU KNOW HIGHER EVEN MEDIUM RISK -- SO I ARE THERE ANY OTHER THEIR THE MODELS IN OTHER STATES THAT WE CAN POINT TO AND SAY YOU KNOW MY GOD THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB AT THE OUTRAGE THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB ON THE -- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ARE THERE SIR ANYWHERE ELSE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION YES I AM COLORADO -- DESPITE THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA BEING EIGHT TIMES THAT OF THE POPULATION OF COLORADO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH IS THE MOST RECENT DATA I COULD FIND COLORADO'S CASH COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM LAVISHED EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS AND SUPPORTED SUPPORT FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT BUSINESSES IN THE SAME YEAR BY COMPARISON CAL CAP CASH COLLATERAL PROGRAM LEVERAGED TO TWENTY POINT ONE MILLION IN LOANS IN SUPPORT OF THIRTY ONE BUSINESSES HOW CAPS CASH COLLATERAL WOULD DO WELL TO INCREASED AS I MENTIONED EARLIER STAFFING AND CENTRALIZATION OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS THE OLD COLORADO IS ONE EIGHTH THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA COLORADO SMALL BUSINESS LOAN PROGRAMS COLLECTIVELY SUPPORTED LOANS TO ONE THIRD AS MANY BUSINESSES AS CAL CAP IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO COLORADO'S OUTREACH IS IN LARGE PART DUE TO CENTRALISATION AND THE CAPACITY OF THIS -- COLLATERAL AND RESERVE PROGRAM AS COMPARED TO THE CENTRALIZATION OF OURS IN CALIFORNIA SO SORRY I TO MAKE SURE THAT I DID THAT I GOT YOUR PUNCH LINE SO YOU'RE AT IS TESTAMENT IN TERMS OF WHY THEY ARE BEING RELATIVELY MORE EFFECTIVE HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THEIR PROGRAMS ARE MORE CENTRALIZED YES IS CENTRALIZE IS SUPPORTED BY THE STAFFING THAT IS REQUIRED SEEK TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A PROGRAM AND ITS OUT REACH COLORADO DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SO MANY AS A CALIFORNIA AND A DIVERSITY OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT FOCUSES ITS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN ONE AREA THAT REACHES OUT TO THE TO THE COMMUNITY AND THAT IS IN THE RULES AND IN THE MINORITY AND LOW AND MODERATE INCOME AREAS AND I THINK AND THEN WE HAD AND MADE THIS POINT AND THE OTHER PANEL THAT WE HAVE SO MANY PROGRAMS HAVE SO MANY RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND IT IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOUR REGULAR PERSON TO NAVIGATE AT TIMES IMPOSSIBLE FOR US IN OUR STAFFS TO NAVIGATE THAT AND I THINK THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING IS BY SIMPLIFYING THAT BY STREAMLINING SOME OF THAT WE CAN GET MORE HELP TO YES THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY NEEDS ONE PLACE TO GO GET IN ANY ONE PLACE TO START WE HAVE SET THEM UP WHERE THEY ARE DIVIDED IS TOO DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE AND WHO THEY'RE TALKING TO WHERE THEY'RE GOING AND THAT IS THE FIRST CONFUSION AND WHEN YOU ARE AND WHEN ENGLISH IS NOT YOUR SECOND LANGUAGE AND WHEN YOU ARE IN COMMUNITIES RURAL COMMUNITIES LIKE HE WAS SPEAKING IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMMUNITY BASED THAT THEY CAN GO TO ONE PLACE AND COME COLLECT THAT DATA IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT AT THE DOOR YES YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE ONLY GONNA HEAR ONE NOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA KEEPING YOUR HEAD AGAINST A WALL SOMETIMES THAT'S WERE ASKING PEOPLE TO DO THANK YOU I'M CURIOUS IF YOU CAN AFTER HEARING THE PANEL ONE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE AUDIENCE AND SEEN WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING CALL AND CALIFORNIA AND IN COMPARISON TO THE COLORADO WHAT CAN YOU SUGGEST ARE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING AND NOT WORKING BASED ON BEING -- WORK THAT YOU DO AND WHAT IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE IN ROUND TWO WELL I WOULD -- HI TECH HERE AS WE ALL KNOW HALF A SUMMIT UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES RIGHT READ EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS GIVING AS A LOT OF LEARNING LESSONS LEARNT SO WE SHOULD DEFINITELY LEARN FROM THEM AND DO THE STARTED -- BUILDING UPON THAT AS WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER DO YOU THE NEW PROGRAMS STILL SOME OF THE LESSONS WE LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC RELIEF EFFORTS I WOULD SAY IS FIRST CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY STRONG AND OPEN REALITY CONSISTENT -- SO WE SHOULD BE LEVERAGING THAT TO REACH COMMUNITIES AND DEPLOYED AND EDUCATE ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE -- THEY UNDERSERVED AS SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITIES NEED MORE TIME AND ALL RIGHT TOUCH POINTS TO BUILD TRUSTS STILL GOING TO WHAT -- ALSO WAS MENTIONING BEFORE IS WE NEED TO BILL TRIES TO REACH REALLY BEING ABLE TO ADVISE THEM INTO WHAT PRODUCTS THEY SHOULD PICK SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND THE THIRD IS OUT LANGUAGE AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO REACH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO WE'VE BEEN MENTIONING A COUPLE TIMES DURING THE PREVIOUS PANEL AND DURING THIS PRESENTATION IS THE LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND DIGITAL DIVIDE ARE AT PEAK CHALLENGE FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES SO UNDERSTANDING THAT IS A CHALLENGE AND REALLY ARE INCLUDING IN THE STRATEGY TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE VITAL T. -- BUILD THAT THIS SUCCESS AND FOURTH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE CRUCIAL FROM AS SPREADING THE INFORMATION -- THE SAME BECAUSE THE DIGITAL LITERACY IS A TALENT WE NEED TO REALLY MAKES THE WAY THAT WE ARE DOING OUR EACH IS TRADITIONAL AVERAGE BUT HE'S ALSO REALLY BUILDING AND LEVERAGING THEY ARE RICHARD AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ABLE TO FIND A SMALL BUSINESSES WHERE THEY ARE THIS IS A LITTLE TRICKY RIGHT BECAUSE -- WE ARE DEALING WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE THIS ENORMOUS INFUSION OF CAPITAL COMING INTO THE STATE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE FORWARD THINKING LEADERS AS STATE LEADERS IN OUR COUNTRY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING REALLY DIFFERENT HERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT HOW WE'RE DEPLOYING CAPITAL AND USING THE TOOLS AND THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO MAKE PROGRAMS OPERATE IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE MONEY IN THE PAST IN THE CHANNELS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY AND EXPECT A DIFFERENT RESULT INDUSTRY FIFTEEN YEARS I LOVE THIS INDUSTRY THE RACIAL AND GENDER WEALTH GAPS HAVE GROWN SAID SEE IF I'D HAVE BEEN DOING THIS WORK THE IMPACT IS REALLY GOOD THE OUTCOME IS NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE TO START WORKING TOWARDS A VERY DIFFERENT OUTCOME AND LOOKING AT HOW WE SOLVE THIS COMPLEX PUZZLE AND IT IN ANY WAY AND IT'S LEADERS LIKE THAT MY CO PANELISTS HERE AND THE ONES BEFORE US THAT I THINK CAN WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH SOME THANK YOU MISS KELLY IF IF I CAN FOLLOW UP ON ON SOMETHING THAT WAS -- YOU ACTUALLY SHARED EARLIER YOU KNOW BASED ON THE CURRENT AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING BETWEEN THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS WHAT SHOULD BE THE DESIRED BALANCE BETWEEN FUNDING SMALL BUSINESS START UPS BUSINESS EXPANSION CERTAIN INDUSTRY SECTORS MICRO BUSINESSES WHAT ARE YOUR INSIGHTS MY MAGIC BUT NOT YOU KNOW I THINK -- THE BALANCE NEEDS TO REFLECT THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE SERVING PERIOD AND SO WE HAVE -- WOMEN OF COLOR SPECIFICALLY BLACK WOMEN START BUSINESSES THAT THE HIGHER IS HIGHEST RATE OF ANY OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC IN OUR IN OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY I'M THEY'RE NOT ACCESSING THAT WHERE ARE THEY ACCESSING THAT WILL BE DEBT PROGRAMS WEREN'T BUILT FOR HER RIGHT THE THE THE CREDIT CRITERIA THAT CREDIT SCORES IN THE ASSET RATIOS AND ALL OF THESE COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS DON'T GIVE HER ANY TRUST ACTUALLY IN THE SYSTEM THAT IT'S GOING TO SUPPORT HER SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN FOSTER FLEXIBILITY -- WHAT ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN FOSTER IN CONTINUE TO TRUST THAT THE PARTNERS THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BUT THEN ALSO THOSE PARTNERS HAVE THE TRUST FROM THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND HOW WE DEPLOY THESE CAPITALS BECAUSE LOOK IF WE FAIL WE'RE THE ONES HAVING TO LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE OUR COMMUNITY IN THE EYE AND SAY SORRY WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT FOR YOU SO WHEN I THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS DISTRIBUTION YES I CAN GIVE YOU DATA ON YOU KNOW THE ACT EXACT DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN BUSINESS SIZE SECTOR AT CETERA BUT REALLY I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IS HOW DO WE CREATE FLEXIBILITY AND INCENTIVIZE FLEXIBILITY AND HOW WE DISTRIBUTE THIS MONEY FOR I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THAT I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO AT THE BEGINNING IS WE CAN LOOK AT THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE THEY START UPS ARE HAVE THEY BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR THREE OR MORE YEARS DO THEY EMPLOY A FIVE OR MORE PEOPLE ARE THEY AT THE POINT OF A REPORTER EXPORTING OUT WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE FIFTEEN EMPLOYEES ARE LESS THEY CREATED TWO THIRDS OF ALL THE NET JOBS SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND NINE WE ALSO KNOW THAT FORTY PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND OF THAT FORTY PERCENT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEM WERE WOMEN OF COLOR GETTING TO HER POINT IN WHAT SHE'S SAYING HERE IF WE CAN MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR BUSINESS AND HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY WE WILL KNOW BASED ON USE OF FUNDS WHAT KIND OF LOANS TO DO THAT AND I THINK WE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I BANK HAS THE FACILITIES TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT KIND OF THING IT WOULD DECIDE QUICKLY -- I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE IDEA OF I HAVE FLEXIBLE -- FLEXIBILITY IN THE PRODUCTS AND JUST TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN THE COBBETT ONE COPY TO STARTED A LOT OF RELIEF PROGRAMS GAME FOR EXISTING BUSINESS TO KEEP THEM AND IN IN OPERATIONS WHICH OBVIOUSLY WAS THE NATURAL NATURAL THING T. DO BUT AS WE WERE LOOKING AND WE ACTUALLY I STARTED SEEING A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS TO START SEEING A START UPS AS THEY WERE COMING AND THEY WERE NOT THAT MANY PRODUCTS FOR THEM AND IT WAS COMPLETELY REASONABLE TO HAVE TO START UPS RIGHT IT WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WAS BEING LAID OFF THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO RETHINK WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO RIGHT SO I NAMES LOOK IN ANY CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAD IN OVER A THOUSAND PERCENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW BUSINESS THAT'S WHEN I SAW THAT IS LIKE A THOUSAND PERCENT INCREASE AND OUR MEMBERS DIDN'T HAVE THE PRODUCT AVAILABLE FOR TO START UPS AT THAT MOMENT SO AS THE ECONOMY RECOVERS THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF CHALLENGES THAT -- WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING AND FLEXIBILITY WILL BE KEY TO RESPOND TO THOSE NEEDS AND REALLY HAVE A SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF OUR VICE CHAIR SECRETARY YEAH THANK YOU THE NEW IS SO OVERWHELMING SO MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO LET ME YOU YOU SOUND LIKE A DSL OR SUPPORT BUSINESSES SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS SO WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY OFF PRIORITY WAFFLE BECAUSE SELF OF THE STARTUPS ALIGHTING SYSTEM ONES SO ARE STRUGGLING COMPANIES I'M MORE INTERESTED IN NOT KNOWING IF YOU HAVE ANY NOW PROGRAM SO I HAVE OUT OF THE BUSINESSES BUSINESS -- BECAUSE SOME OF A LACK OF -- CUSTOMERS SO WORK COULDN'T PAY THE RENT OR WHATEVER THEY ARE OUT OF THE PICTURE AND THAT THEY ARE NOT BENEFITING ANY PROGRAM SAID THAT THE SO MUCH MONEY THAT THE GUYS TALK ABOUT COMING FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- SO MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT FIRST WELL I WOULD SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO MEET THE BUSINESS WHERE THEY ARE AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE ALL OF COOKIE CUTTER PREDICTIONS BECAUSE ENTREPRENEURS COME FROM ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IN ALL TYPES OF TYPES OF DID BUSINESS START UPS SO YOU YOU WOULD HAVE TO IN THIS IS WHY IT IS KEY TO HAVE COUNSELING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NOT JUST TRAINING BUT COUNSELING TO GET TO UNDERSTAND THAT ENTREPRENEUR GET UNDERSTAND HIM OR HER AND IN THE PROCESS AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL A AND HOW I WILL HANDLE OR COUNCIL AND RESTAURANT WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN FINANCIAL SERVICES OR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND HOW I WOULD COUNSEL SOMEONE THAT HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR TWO TO THREE YEARS VERSUS SOMEONE THIS COMING FROM THEIR INITIAL THOUGHT AND PATTERNS TO IMPLEMENTATION TO COVER COMMERCIALIZATION WOULD BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT SO IT IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO SAY TO YOU THAT I WOULD HAVE A WAY OF APPROACHING HIM BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK IS KEY TO ALL OF THEM IS THAT THEIR FIRST THING IS TO UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL -- OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY HAVE WHAT IS THEIR COST OF OPERATIONS WHAT IS THEIR PROFITABILITY WHAT IS THEIR REAL PAID REPAYMENT ABILITY WHEN THEY LOOK AT DEBT AND AND IF IS IS THAT REALLY WHAT THEY NEED TO GO FOUR VERSES IS IT VENTURE CAPITALISTS OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN THROUGH THEIR OWN PROFITS AND CASH FLOW SO YOU THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE AND NOW WITH ANALYZE VERY THOROUGHLY INTO THEIR PROCESS AND I I THINK THAT IS KEY THAT WE DON'T TRY TO SET UP A A ONE STOP ONE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT WOULD -- ALIENATE AND AND NOT INCLUDE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR OPERATIONS SO FOR THOSE -- ALREADY -- BUSINESS OF BUSINESS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SO TO TO -- FINANCIAL -- COUPLE REVENUE AND ON THE OUTSIDE THE RESOURCE IS AND SO FOR THE FOR THE -- SO ON TIA'S DAY INITIATE THAT THAT THEY WERE NOT REVIVED THEIR -- BUSINESS BAD AND THEN APPLY FOR IT THOUGH YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW WHO THEY ARE YOU DON'T REACH OUT TO THEM WELL I I I DISAGREE I THINK THAT IS A VERY GOOD POINT SIR AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE MORE PROACTIVE WITH THIS EXTRA MONEY THAT WE ARE GETTING THIS ONE TIME OBLIGATION WE CAN USE THIS AS A LAB TO SEE HOW WE DO WE CAN EMPLOY A SOME OF THE FUNDS IN THIS TEAM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND AND GIVE A DIRECTIVE TO OUR SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS TO GO OUT PRO ACTIVELY AND AND DO SURVEYS AND GET INTO THESE COMMUNITIES AND FIND OUT WHAT OUR COMMUNITIES NEED -- ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO ALSO IS SUPPORT THE CURRENT BILL WE HAVE A BILL WHAT IS A ONE STOP CAPITAL SHOPS AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX WE WANT TO LOOK THESE KINDS OF THINGS WILL NOT ONLY HELP BUT THEY WILL HELP US COLLECT COLLECT DATA TO FIND OUT WHERE OUR BUSINESSES ARE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR BUSINESSES AND IN SOME CASES EVEN HELP US GET AROUND THE LIMITATIONS OF -- TWO OH NINE SO I THINK THAT WE IF WE COULD COLLECT THOSE MORE INNOVATIVE WE CAN BE MORE PROACTIVE WE CAN ACTUALLY NOT WAIT FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS TO YELL HELP BUT ACTUALLY GOING TO COMMUNITIES AND AND FOUND OUT IN THE SYSTEM NOW AS FAR AS I KNOW A BEING A FORMER MAYOR OF A CITY OF IRVINE AND ALL THE BUSINESSES IN THE CITY WE HAVE REQUIRED THEM TO REGISTER AND THEN WHEN THEY CLOSE DOWN WHEN THEY NEED TO REPORT TO US SO WE KNOW WHICH BUSINESSES EXISTED AND THE WHICH BUSINESSES NOW HAVE CLOSE DOWN SO WE DO HAVE WITH DATA WHICH WANTS TO WE HAVE -- REACHED IT WE HAVE LOST IN THE THOSE ARE THE ONES SO WITHOUT IN ANY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR STATE GOVERNMENT WILL INITIATE THE REACHING OUT TO THEM HEY WHAT CAN I KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU TO COME BACK AND HELP YOU GROW YOUR BUSINESS SO RESTART THE ARE YOU DOING THAT WELL I I THINK THAT IN THAT LIFE CYCLE YOUR LITTLE TOO LATE -- I THINK THAT THAT WE NEED TO BE NOT JUST REGISTERING THEM AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN DOING AN EXIT INTERVIEW AS A CLOSER LOOK LOSE THEIR BUSINESS BUT WE SHOULD BE IN THERE IN THE TRENCHES TRYING TO FIND OUT WE'RE IN THE RED FLAG IS LIFTED WHERE THEY WOULD NEED HELP THAT IS NOT A GOVERNMENT ROLE THAT IS THE ROLE OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS OF OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PEOPLE AND IF WE EMPLOY THEM TO DO THIS IF WE GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY GET INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND I HAD TO HAVE A FINGER IN THE POLLS ON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES BEFORE THEY ARE AT THE POINT OF CLOSURE THEN WE ARE HOLDING ON TO SUSTAINABILITY THEN WE ARE MOVING IN AND EXPANDING GROWTH AND NOT ONLY CAN WE DO IT AT THE POINT OF OF NOT LETTING THEM DIE BUT ALSO HELPING THEM EXPAND OPENING INTO NEW MARKETS OPENING INTO THE MIDDLE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACCESS TO CAPITAL BUT REALLY WHAT KEEPS A BUSINESS GOING IS AT ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY SO I THINK WE WE NEED TO LOOK AT BOTH YEAH I HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS SO AMONG THE MANY -- ONE OF THE RESTAURANT OWNER SAID THAT I HAD WITH THE KNOWN -- I CALLED HIM AND HE SAID THE I. SHUT DOWN BUT I STARTED AS TO A DIFFERENT CITY THE REASON WAS THAT THE -- THEY ARE RENT WENT UP BY A TOO MUCH AND THAT HE COULDN'T SUSTAIN SO HE HAS TO GO OUT OF FLOOD THAT THE PARTICULAR CITY AND THEN LOOK FOR WHERE HE COULD AFFORD TO IN THIS CASE SO HE HAD THE SOME ASSETS THAT TO CONTINUE BUT THE SOME OF THE -- PEOPLE MAY GIVE UP AND COULDN'T HANDLE SO WE HAVE SEEN MANY RENT CONTROL FOR OUR RESIDENTS FOR PROFIT THE HOME IN OUR APARTMENT RENTERS SO BUT I I DON'T THINK I REMEMBER WHETHER THERE'S ANY RENT CONTROL OR OUR RANGE THAT THE ATTENDANCE IT WOULD NOT BEST MORE BUSINESS IT WOULD NOT BE BONTA WITH THAT KIND OF OUTRAGEOUS TO RAISE IT AS A SENSIBLE AREA FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THE WHETHER THERE IS ANY REGULATION THAT -- -- THE ONLY REASON I THINK OF WHAT RAN THE AWARD FOR MOST OF EXISTING BUSINESS WATER BUSINESS SAID DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT I DO KNOW THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MUNICIPALITIES TEND TO HAVE -- BUSINESS SUPPORT AND TAXES -- CREDIT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN THEIR OPERATIONS WITHIN THEIR CITY -- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THAT QUIBBLING AT THE STATE LEVEL AND I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE BUT I DO THINK THAT LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES HAVE THE JURISDICTIONS TO -- IN START UP CASES PUT ON SMALL BUSINESSES IN INCUBATORS ORIENT IN ACCELERATORS OR IF THEIR EXISTING BUSINESS TO ALLOW THEM SOME KIND OF RATE REDUCTION OR TAX CREDIT -- TO COMPLICATE THEIR CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM IN OPERATIONS IN THAT IN THAT GOES ON BERMAN IS A PENALTY BY MUNICIPALITY YEAH I WOULD DECIDE THAT PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND HAD -- DISCOVER I LIKE THAT HAS BEEN A BIG CHALLENGE WHEN A SMALL BUSINESSES STARTING TO I SEE THAT MAYBE CLOSING WAS THE SOLUTION OR THE EXIT STRATEGY UNFORTUNATELY SO THERE IS A LOT OF -- PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO GUIDE A SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGH THE PROCESS TO SEE IF THAT IS REALLY THE RIDE OP NEXT A STEP OR IF THERE IS ANY SOLUTION THAT COULD BE DONE BEFOREHAND I THINK THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT BROUGHT BRINGS US BACK TO THE OUTREACH WE NEED TO KNOW TO DO BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF A SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE SUFFERING THROUGH THAT A WE'RE NOT AWARE OF A LOT OF LIKE LEGAL ASSISTANCE WORKSHOPS THAT COULD COULD HAVE HELPED THEM WITH THE RENT -- CONTRACTS OR WITH THE LEASES SO BEING ABLE TO GET THEM WE THOUGHT THOSE RESOURCES IT'S KIND OF REALLY BRINGS OUT MORE -- LIKE BRING SOME MORE CONNECTING THEM TO THE RIGHT ORGANIZATIONS YEAH U. S. MORE A BUSINESS OWNER MYSELF FROM MY OFFICE MANAGING WITH NOW -- IS THERE ANY FOR BUSINESS PAPER TO GO TO AND THEY LEARN ABOUT THE WHOLE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OR COUNSELING WHATEVER THE STATE WILL BE A ONE STOP THERE'S A BILL YOU'RE PUSHING INTO AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX YEAH HE TERRY NORRIS WHO I DON'T YES ON THE ON I WILL BE HERE IN THE BILL IN COMMITTEE SO DOCTOR CHARM SURE YOU AND YOU HAVE THE PLEASURE SPEAKING ON THAT BILL THEN IT'S CERTAINLY AN EXCITING BILL THAT WILL BE HELPFUL AND -- BRING IN EVERYTHING ONE CENTRALIZED LOCATION I DO WANT TO JUST TAKE NOTE OF THE TIME I KNOW THAT WE HAVE ONLY A FEW MOMENTS LAST MINUTES LOTS OF THIS PANEL A DOCTOR TODAY HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS AT THE MOMENT THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY ALL RIGHT SO LET ME JUST CLOSE I I DO HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR THE PANEL ASIDE FROM THE FINANCING PROGRAMS IT THEMSELVES WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTION THE STATE CAN TAKE TO LEVERAGE THE S. S. B. C. I. PROGRAM -- FUNDS IN CREATING A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU WANT TO SERVE AS YOU DESIGN THE SOLUTION LOOK AT THE INHERITED BIASES THAT THE UNDERWRITING PROCESS AND COMMERCIAL LENDING IN STEALS WITH THE FIVE SEAS OF CREDIT -- COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE -- THINGS THAT THEY ARE REQUIRING SMALL BUSINESSES TO HAVE AS THEY TRIED TO START A SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S LIKE THE CHICKEN BEFORE THE EGG IS IT'S NOT IT'S INHERENTLY NOT FAIR AND I WOULD SAY THAT I WOULD JUST REITERATE THE IDEA OF LEVERAGING -- THE ECOSYSTEM AND THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS I WOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT THEIR SMALL BUSINESSES SO THE RIGHT TOOLS -- I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONSIDER ALL THAT IT'S JUST LIKE THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS WE HALF RIGHT SO AS WE ARE LOOKING DEFINITELY COMING BACK TO IS THE WRATH AND ALTERNATIVE UNDER GLIDING THERE IS A LOT OF -- PILOT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR TO DO TWO I HAVE A LONG WAY TO SMALL BUSINESS SAYS BUT THERE IS ALSO SOME MANAGE OP SUPPORT TO REALLY UP PROVIDE THAT I'LL REACH IN CONNECTION TO A WOMEN OWNED BUSINESS SAYS MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR SO BEING ABLE TO REALLY GET DIED TO -- SUPPORT OF PARTNERS THAT ARE WE ARE OLD TEAM CALIFORNIA THAT WAS BUT WE WERE TALKING SO HOW COULD WE ALL COME TOGETHER TO REALLY REACH A SMALL BUSINESSES AND -- DID FOR THE SIGN A PROGRAM THAT REALLY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES WILL BE A KEY THANK YOU SO MUCH I TO EACH OF YOU FOR YOUR DYNAMIC PRESENTATIONS I KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE ONE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING BACK UP I BANK IN C. B. CFA R. FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO ANY COMMENTS OR RECOMMEND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE DURING THIS HEARING AS WELL AS ANSWER ANY FINAL QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE THANK YOU CAN THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR OUR FINAL WE HAD A FINAL -- PANEL WHICH WAS THAT ITS IT'S -- AT MISTER SCOTT WILL WITH I. BANK AND MICHELA DEVISE DANIEL WITH CP CFA FOR OUR THIRD PANEL SO WE APPRECIATE -- TREASURE BY YOU STAYING WITH US IN AND JOINING US -- AGAIN FOR THE THIRD PANEL AND AGAIN THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE PANEL NUMBER HOW TO CATCH A FLIGHT ONLY APPRECIATED THERE WAS A LOT OF CONVERSATION DONE AT NIGHT YOU KNOW WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE GOT TO THE PANEL IN TIME AND WE LEFT OFF -- WITH SEVERAL QUESTIONS I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO GO BACK TO IT BUT SPECIFICALLY HOW AND AND BASED ON THE CONVERSATION THE HER TODAY ON HOW CONFUSING AT ALL IS RIGHT FOR SOMEBODY JUST TRYING TO GET ASSISTANCE HOW AN APPLICANT KNOW ABOUT THESE TWO PROGRAMS WILL SEE P. CFA OR AYE BANK REFERRED THEM TO THE PROGRAMS AND WHAT IS THE ROLE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL PLAY WITH BOTH C. P. CFA AND I BANK YEAH SO -- OTHER START OFF AND THEN SCOTT MAYBE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT WE ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE TWO PROGRAMS SIMULTANEOUSLY LATE THAT CAL CAP WE HAVE A LOAN LOSS GUARANTEE PROGRAM I BANK I'M SORRY WE HAVE A LOAN LOSS RESERVE PROGRAM THE I. BANK HAS A LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM AND SO THEY ARE TO COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER LIKE MR BUYS DANIEL SAYS AND NOT COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER SO WE TALK ABOUT IT AS ONE PACKAGE NOT A COMPETITION SOME OF THE THE LAST PANEL UP YOU KNOW I THANK IN C. P. CFA WE ARE TO AGENCIES IF YOU LOOK AT THE S. S. B. C. I. REPORT FROM THE LAST ONE IN TWENTY ELEVEN ALMOST ALL THE STATES HAD TO ENTITIES THAT DISTRIBUTED THE FUNDS WHETHER IT WAS TO PUBLIC ENTITIES OR A PUBLIC AND A PRIVATE ENTITY AND I REALLY THINK THIS GOES TO THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT PEOPLE WANT TO INSTILL IN THIS PROGRAM THAT YOU DON'T GO TO ONE PROGRAM THEY SAY NO BUT THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER OPTION RIGHT SO THERE'S LIKE TWO BITES OF THE APPLE INSTEAD OF JUST ONE AGENCY THAT ONCE YOU SAY NO THAT'S IT RIGHT YOU HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT WAS SET UP THIS WAY AS WELL WITH A BANK AND A C. P. CFA BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE THE EXECUTIVE AND WHO'S GOING TO BE THE TREASURE AND SOMETIMES EXECUTIVE MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME AND SO THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- INSTILLED IN THE TREASURE WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE OR SOME OTHER AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE -- CHECKS AND BALANCES PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER COLLABORATING INSTEAD OF JUST HOGGING ALL THE MONEY -- AND I WILL GIVE YOU AN EGG A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE IF YOU IF YOU WANT AGENCIES ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND IN OUR OFFICE AND WHEN I WAS HERE AND GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER WAS THE GOVERNOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE PUT AS MUCH OF THE BOND CAP TOWARD AFFORDABLE HOUSING HE WOULD HAVE USED THE BOND CAP FOR JAILS FOR STADIUMS HOUSING WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN ITS FAIR SHARE AND SO HAVING THIS CHECK AND BALANCE AGAIN IS WHY I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS SET UP THESE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT WE ARE AS FLEXIBLE AS WE CAN BE A COUPLE OF OTHER AVENUES WE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WE COULD DO MORE OUTREACH IS THE WILDLIFE ACCOUNT HOLDERS ARE THAT IS A LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND -- WE INVEST FOR TWENTY TWO LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS AND THIS IS SO LIKE THE CITY OF IRVINE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A WHOLE INVESTMENT STAFF AND THEY COULD BETTER LEVERAGE BY PULLING THE MONEY TOGETHER WITH US OUR CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND SO BY A KANEMI UPSCALE AND -- BECAUSE WE ARE SO BIG CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A LOCAL AGENCIES WE ARE ABLE TO -- TO GET BETTER RATES AND WE CAN USE OUR LEAF ACCOUNT HOLDERS ALSO FOR MORE OUTREACH UP FOR THESE UPCOMING PROGRAMS AND THEN CAL SAVERS -- I CHEER CAL SAVERS WHICH IS A RETIREMENT SAVINGS PROGRAM WE ARE RUNNING A BILL TO EXPAND THE REQUIREMENT FOR ANY UP EMPLOYER WHO HAS ONE EMPLOYEE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS AN OPEN THESE CAL SAVERS ACCOUNT SO WE WILL HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHO THESE SMALL SMALL ONE PERSON -- -- COMPANIES ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO OFFER RETIREMENT SAVINGS BUT WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO ACCESS SO THAT'S ANOTHER AVENUE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO THEN FOR -- -- AS A MEMBER CHOI YOU KNOW THE RENTS ART PROGRAMS DO ENABLE COMPANIES TO APPLY FOR WORKING CAPITAL AS WELL AS A DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS BUT A LOT OF THEM DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT AND THAT'S BECAUSE SOME OF THE LENDERS THAT WE WORK WITH THE CD FI'S WHICH WE LOVE WE WORK WITH THE S. B. DC IS BY THE U. S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE STATE AND THIS IS FREE RESOURCES BUT YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITIES WERE ASIAN RIGHT WE HAVE MONTH LAOTIAN THAI CAMBODIAN KOREAN FILIPINO JAPANESE CHINESE I MEAN THAT'S EIGHT DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS JUST IN THE API AND NOT ALL OF THEM KNOW HOW TO ACCESS OR TRUST OF THESE PROVIDERS SO HOPEFULLY WITH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MONEY THAT'S COMING FROM THE FEDS WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB IN OUT REACHING TO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU KNOW WEEK SERVICE -- -- THAT ARE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO -- TO THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS IT'S NOT IN LANGUAGE THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING THERE THAT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE AND DOING THE OUTREACH SO SCOTT MAYBE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE YEAH I THINK THE TREASURE AND SO YEAH I I THINK MUCH OF THE VEIN OF THAT PANEL HAD TO DO WITH CONFUSION AND CONFUSION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY ON TWO PARTS ONE THE NOTION THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A CENTRALIZED PLACE TO GO AND THE OTHER HAVING TO DO WITH ITS SECURITY PRODUCTS THAT IS HARD TO NAVIGATE AND SELL SPEAK TO BOTH I THINK YOU KNOW THE COMMON PLACE TO GO THE THERE THE STATE REPRESENTS SMALL BUSINESSES FOR CREDIT PROGRAMS THROUGH IRAQ AND THROUGH CITY CFA AND WE WORK TOGETHER ON THOSE PROGRAMS WE HAVE COMMON LENDERS IN ORLAND PARTICIPATING LENDER NETWORK WE WORK THROUGH S. B. C.'S TOGETHER I THINK IT'S PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD THROUGHOUT THE NETWORK HAVING A CENTRALIZED LOCATION IS ON ONE DAY IN A WAY TO APPROACH JUST MAKING IT SIMPLE FOR SOMEBODY TO GO TO KNOW WHERE TO GO TO THE OTHER PART IS ACTUALLY NEEDING THE MORE THEY ARE RIGHT SO THAT WAS THE OTHER DAY AND THEN YOU HAVE TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE AND WE DO BOTH RIGHT SO WE DO BOTH WITH ALL THE PROGRAMS WE WORK THROUGH OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY LENDERS THROUGHOUT THIS THAT COVER THE ENTIRE STATE WE WORK WITH THIRTY EIGHT SIGNIFIES THAT COVER THE ENTIRE STATE WE CONTRACT WITH SEVEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT COURTS THAT HELP AND ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES NAVIGATE THE PROCESS NEXT TIME SOMEWHAT CENTRALIZED IN HOW WE PROVIDE THE PRODUCTS AND -- VERY MUCH MEETING THE CUSTOMER BASE AND SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY WHERE THEY ARE THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIPS THERE ARE NETWORKS AND THROUGH OUR COMMUNITIES I I KNOW CAROLINE UP QUITE WELL I'M SPEAKING AT HER A WEAPON ARE THE COUPLE WEEKS I'VE SPOKEN AT HER WEAPON ARE A FEW MONTHS AGO AND SHE WAS BEFORE THAT SO WE WE HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH CAMEO AND SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY WITH ALL OF THE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND UP AND BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE WILL COMMUNICATE WITH THEM JOINTLY WITH US TREASURE'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE INFORMED AND THEY'RE REACHING THEIR MEMBERSHIP AS A TRUSTED ENTITY OUT IN THE FIELD WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HAVE SOMEBODY STATION EVERYWHERE ON THE FIELD AND ALSO THE SMALL BUSINESS -- ADVOCATE IS THE GRANTING AGENCY AND THEY'RE ALSO THE SUPPORT FOR THE T. EIGHTY IN THE STATE AND SO I THINK WE ARE QUITE CENTRALIZED ON ONE END AND WE ALSO NEED TO BUSINESS COMMUNITY WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND WHERE THEY NEED TO TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE OUT IN THE FIELD THE SECOND PORTION OF THE CONFUSION CONRAD HAD TO DO WITH THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND WHAT'S OUT OF THE BUSINESS NEEDS ARE AND UNFORTUNATELY THE FINANCIAL WORLD IS QUITE COMPLEX AND EVEN THE FINANCIAL PICTURE FOR A VERY SMALL BUSINESS CAN BE EXCEPTIONALLY COMPLEX A SMALL BUSINESS AND I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES UP PLETHORA OF PRODUCTS THAT THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE EVERYTHING FROM COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY TO VENDOR FINANCING EQUIPMENT FINANCING TO MERCHANT CASH ADVANCES REVENUE BASED FINANCING FACTORING REAL ESTATE LOANS AND MORTGAGES TO -- MEZZANINE LOANS AND VENTURE DEBT TO CREDIT CARD LOANS AND REVOLVERS AND WORKED WORKING CAPITAL LINES ENSURE YOU PAUSE I COULD GO ON YOU KNOW FOR FOR A LONG TIME ON THIS LIST AND SO THEY NEED HELP YOU NEED TO FINISH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS THEY NEED TO BE PROVIDERS THEY NEED THEIR LENDING RELATIONSHIPS OUT IN THE FIELD TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE AND GUIDE THEM TOWARDS WHAT'S THE MOST APPROPRIATE PRODUCT FOR THEM AND ALTHOUGH GENERALLY DEFINED FROM US SOME COMBINATION OF MY BAG RECEIVE THE CFA AND SO WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF MAKING SURE WE CONTINUE TO KEEP THAT INFORMATION FLOW -- VERY FLUID BUT I I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YEAH WE WE INTEND TO DO WHEN HOPE IT HAPPENS -- WE IMMEDIATELY AND I THINK APRIL OR MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY PUT UP A LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR ON THE WEBSITES OR APPLICATIONS AND INFORMATION ITEMS WERE AVAILABLE IN OVER A HUNDRED LANGUAGES AND EVERY STEP TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY AND WE HAVE TO WONDER JEWELERS RELATIONSHIPS AND PEOPLE IN THE FIELD THANK YOU -- I THINK WHAT I APPRECIATE THANK YOU FOR THAT APPRECIATE ABOUT -- MISTER CORNELIUS WITH THEM DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR REGIONAL ECONOMIC DIVISION AT THE MILKEN INSTITUTE AND I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE ALL KIND OF STRIVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THE NATURE OF IMPLICIT BIAS I THINK THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE PANEL MEMBER TO AND WHEN WE TRIED TO MOVE ISSUES AROUND BUDGET RELATED TO THE CHALLENGE OF PROP TWO OH NINE AGAIN I I BRING IT UP BECAUSE WE ALL RECOGNIZE IT WE ALL HAVE THESE MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS THAT WE WANT TO ATTAIN TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR AND THE THE GATHERING OF THAT INFORMATION IS OFTEN ONLY DONE ON ME -- VOLUNTEER BASIS SINCE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ACTUALLY LEGALLY REQUIRE IT WHICH THEN GIVES US I THINK A A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY AS TO WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO WE COULD DO ALL THE OUTRAGE THAT WE WANT AND ULTIMATELY THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH RESPONSE THAT WE CAN GET SO I'M JUST AGAIN I JUST I WANT TO GET OUT THE POINT OF HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THESE GOALS THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE ACROSS THE STATE WELL WE HAVE THESE VERY REAL CHALLENGES IN PLACE WHILE WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN ATTAINING A LOAN FOR A SMALL BUSINESS IS ALSO VERY DIFFICULT HOW WE MAY POSSIBLY BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS WE TRY TO REACH OUT TO COMMUNITIES AND SO WE'RE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A POT FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO REACH OUT TO YOU KNOW THE EIGHT API COMMUNITIES THAT YOU MENTIONED AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE ACROSS THE STATE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BEING CHALLENGE UNLIMITED AS TO WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE ON THE OUTCOME YEAH NO I MEAN THAT THAT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO PARTNER WITH ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN OUTREACH NETWORKS -- BUT LIKE EVEN IF YOU ASK SOME OF YOUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS YOU KNOW DO THEY BELONG TO THE CHAMBER SOME SAY YES SOME SAY NO WHO ELSE DO THEY BELONG TO SUMMER JUST BUSY THEY JUST DON'T HAVE TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN RIGHT SO HOW DO WE REACH OUT TO THEM IS IT THROUGH LOCAL NEWSPAPERS OR RADIO THE -- STATIONS YOU KNOW MAYBE WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE OUTREACH BUT THAT ALSO COMES FROM MONEY RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PUT MONEY INTO ADVERTISING PUT MONEY INTO YOU KNOW IN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS PUT LANGUAGE INTO TRANSLATION OF ALL THESE MATERIALS SO WE'RE HOPING WITH THIS NEW MONEY THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO MORE OF THAT BECAUSE WE TRY TO DO IT IN OUR OFFICES TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW WHO PARTNERS WITH US AND WHO THEY REACH OUT TO AND WHETHER YOU KNOW YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE GETTING YOUR NEWSLETTER SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT YOU'RE HAVING A WEAPON ARE SOME MADE SOME MAY NOT RIGHT THE SAVVIER ONES USUALLY DO BUT THE ONES THAT NEED THE MOST HELP DON'T USUALLY REACH OUT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE AND THEN THEY'RE CALLING OUR OFFICE SAYING HEY I CAN'T PAY MY RENT AND THEM LIKE THE GENTLEMAN SAID WELL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE TO GET A LOAN AFTER YOU SHUT DOWN ALL YOUR BEHIND YOUR RENT YOU KNOW EIGHT MONTHS SO WE NEED TO JUST DO A BETTER JOB IN TERMS OF OUT REGION AND PROMOTIONS AND HOPEFULLY WITH THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE CAN ACQUIT THE SPD SEES IT ALL THE CAMEOS OF THE CDF EYES GET MORE OF THEM ENGAGED AND SIGNED UP HAS PARTICIPATING LENDERS SO THAT THEY CAN REACH OUT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES I KNOW I'D LIKE TO BE SURE TO CLARIFY THAT THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IS FOR THE ENTIRE NATION THE NEW YORKER HAS NOT ALLOCATED OKAY CALIFORNIA SO WE'LL GET ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE PERCENT BASED ON OUR POPULATION YEAH AND AND SO I THINK THE TREASURES EXACTLY RIGHT YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING TO CAN A HAND WITH HER AND HER TEAM TO DO ALL IN WITH THE THINGS THAT SHE EXPRESSED WHEN I CAME ON BOARD I BEG I QUICKLY RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MARKETING LINE ITEM RIGHT WE HAVE NO MARKETING BUDGET AND SO WE HAVE TO TREAT IF WE HAVE TO BE SCRAPPY WE HAVE TO LEVERAGE RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE TO USE THE TREASURES MICROPHONE THE GOVERNOR'S MEGAPHONE TO GET THE WORD OUT THERE AND WE WE DO THAT WITH OUR SMALL TEAMS IN THEIR LIMITED BUDGETS S. B. C. THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME DEGREE OF ADMIN OVERHEAD COVERAGE SOME OF WHICH CAN BE USED FOR OUR REGION MARKING PURPOSES SO THAT WILL BRING SOME ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES TO US BUT HAVING SAID THAT YOU KNOW WE WE DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WHEN WE WATCH THE CARBONITE TEAM -- LOAN PROGRAM APRIL TWENTY TWENTY OUR RESULTS TO DATE OF THE NEARLY TWO THOUSAND OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE RECEIVED THAT LOAN GUARANTEE EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEM ARE FEMALE OWNED MINORITY OWNED OR ARE LOCATED AND HELLO MY HE CONTRACTS AND AND THEREFORE WE KNOW IT'S DOABLE WELL I WOULD NEED TO DO MORE OF IT AND WITH GREATER RESOURCES WE HOPE YOU HAVE A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE AT AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT -- FOR CP CFA THE CAL CAP PROGRAM THE LENDER AND THE LENDING NETWORK -- THERE IS NOT BUT GET BORROWS FIND THEIR WAY TO IT SINCE TWENTY TWENTY WITH APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED INQUIRIES FROM SMALL BUSINESSES LOOKING FOR RESOURCES IN RESPONSE TO THE CULVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC -- NCPC FAA -- CAL CAP WE WORK WITH DEDICATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LOCATED IN REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HELPING TO SERVE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDERSERVED AND UNDER CAPITALIZED BY WORKING WITH MISSION BASED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CDFI WE HAVE MADE CONCERTED EFFORTS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR WOMEN MINORITIES THE DISABLED AND VETERANS DURING S.

S. B. C. I. CAPITAL FOR THE ALMOST TWO MILLION WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA MOST OF WHOM ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO RECOVER FROM THE PAST TWO YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC IMPACTS ON OUR ECONOMY AND I KNOW YOU BOTH KNOW ALL OF YOU HERE KNOW THAT WOMEN HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AND AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC THEY'VE HAD TO LEAVE THE WORK FORCE AND DRUGS AND THEY'RE STILL STRUGGLING TO RE ENTER DUE TO LACK OF CHILD CARE AND GENERAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY DURING THIS TIME THE WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS HAVE STEPPED UP AND MORE THAN DOUBLED THEIR SERVICES TO WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM WERE WOMEN OF COLOR AND LOWER INCOME WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS LEVERAGED OVER A HUNDRED AND SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS AND GRANTS AND PROVIDED INTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENABLE WOMEN TO PIVOT THEIR BUSINESSES SELL ONLINE AND SUSTAIN OPERATIONS S.

S. B. C. I WILL SUPPORT EXTENSIVE LOAN GUARANTEES FOR EXAMPLE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES ARE TURNED DOWN FOR CREDIT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PERSONAL GUARANTEES SO TAKING MORE RISK WILL RESULT IN GREATER ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WHICH IN TURN WILL LEAD TO MORE HIGH GROWTH BUSINESSES AND JOB CREATION IN LMI COMMUNITIES FURTHERMORE THE KEY TO CREDIT ACCESS IS CRITICAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S COUNSELING PREPARATION OF FINANCIALS AND CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS AND POST LAUNCH SUPPORT TO AND THIS T.
