THE OVERSIGHT OF CALIFORNIA'S TAX- DEPARTMENTS IN A TWENTY THE LEGISLATURE TWO BILLS AB ONE OH TWO AND AB ONE THIRTY ONE THAT CREATED TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS. AND TRANSFERRED ALL OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION STATUTORY DUTIES FOR THE TO THESE DEPARTMENTS THE B. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION IN THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS THE BE- WE MAINTAINED. ITS CONSTITUTIONAL OVER TAXES AND I'LL CALL THE BEVERAGE INSURANCE AND PROPERTY THIS ISSUE IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OVER THE TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS THE B. O. E. FOR YEARS AND TO THIS TRANSITION. LET'S BEGIN. MISTER ASSET KIRSTEIN ARE YOU ON THE LINE IF SO PLEASE YES. SO SORRY YEAR NO THAT'S FINE THANK AYE AYE FORGET THAT WERE IN PERSON NOW APOLOGIES NO NO PROBLEM MADAM CHAIR US YOU I'M CHRISTINE WITH THE L. A. L. AND I'LL BE PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW. OF THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT THE STATE MADE TO ITS TAX AGENCIES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND OF SOME OF THEIR SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITIES AND WE'VE DISTRIBUTED A HANDOUT TO ACCOMPANY MY TESTIMONY SOME VERSIONS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN PAPER NOW- I'LL START ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT- WHICH HAS A LITTLE FLOW CHART. IT WAS BEFORE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAWS SO AT THAT TIME- THE- TWO MAIN TERA AGENCIES WORD THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD KNOWN AS F. T. B. AND THE- STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION KNOWN AS B. O. E. SO I HAVE TO BE ADMINISTERED AND CONTINUES TO ADMINISTER- PERSONAL AND CORPORATE INCOME TAXES. AND AT THAT TIME B. O. E. ADMINISTERED THE SALES AND USE TAX AS WELL AS DOZENS OF SMALLER TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS. I AND AT THAT TIME B. O. WE ALSO HEARD APPEALS FOR ALL STATE TAXES- ALTHOUGH DOE WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION MOST OF ITS DUTIES WERE ASSIGNED BY STATUTE. I AM JUST A NOTE FOR SIMPLICITY THIS FIGURE AND A SIMILAR ONE LATER AND HANDED DO NOT DEPICT VARIOUS OTHER STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THESE. TAX PROGRAMS. SO TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT I WILL DESCRIBE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAWS THAT CHANGED THIS LANDSCAPE. BOE'S STRUCTURE COMBINES. ASPECT AND FEATURES OF THE LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND DUE TO THE CONFLICT INHERENT IN THIS STRUCTURE OUR OFFICE AND OTHERS. ALL LONG EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT BOE'S ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY IN MANY YEARS AND MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN LAWS. ALL RIGHT AND OTHER ENQUIRIES- INDICATED A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS WITH BOE'S OPERATIONS INCLUDING SOME ACTIONS THAT WERE NOT CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVES AND SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR RESPONDED TO THESE CONCERNS BY PASSING AND SIGNING AB ONE OH TWO AND AB ONE THIRTY ONE. SO THESE LAWS TRANSFERRED BOE'S STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES TO TWO NEW ENTITIES THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION KNOWN AS CD TFA AND THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS WHICH YOU JUST HEARD FROM KNOWN AS AU TA- AND BE- WE RETAINED ITS CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OVER TAXES ON PROPERTY INSURANCE AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. WE'VE GOT ANOTHER FLOW CHART HERE IN THIS ONE DEPICTS THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF STATE TAX ADMINISTRATION AND APPEALS- SO THROUGH INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS CD TFA CARRIES OUT MANY ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS RELATED TO TAXES ON INSURANCE AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ON BEHALF OF B. O. E. AND SO BE ALWAYS TAX ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS ARE LARGELY FOCUSED ON. PROPERTY TAXES. R. O. T. A. THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HEARING MOST TAX APPEAL CASES INCLUDING INCOME TAXES AND SALES TAXES. ARE THESE CASES ARE HEARD AS AS YOU HEARD BY PANELS OF THREE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES IN ONE OF THREE LOCATIONS SACRAMENTO FRESNO LOS ANGELES. SO TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT HERE I'M JUST GOING TO COVER SOME BRIEF HIGHLIGHTS- FOR THESE THREE AND CITIES OVER THE LAST HALF DECADE. SO CD TFA THAT WERE PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN PROP SIXTY FOUR TWENTY SIXTEEN. DAVE I IMPLEMENTED THE EXPANDED USE TAX NEXUS ESTABLISHED BY THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN- SO U. S. SUPREME COURT WAYFAIR RULING AND THEY HAVE COMPLETED. A MAJOR I. T. PROJECT NEW PROPERTY TAX RULES AND THEY ALSO OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS AND EXPERIENCE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL FLUCTUATIONS- THE SHARE OF A STAFF POSITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FILLED- THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS IS HEARD TAX APPEALS AND- ISSUE WRITTEN OPINIONS WITHIN A HUNDRED DAYS. OF EACH HEARING US SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THEY'VE BEEN HEARING CASES REMOTELY AS YOU HEARD FROM FROM THERE- STAFF- ALTHOUGH THE OFFICE PLANS TO RE COMMENCE IN PERSON ORAL HEARINGS. IN SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES IN APRIL AND JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE- THE LAST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT LISTS EXPENDITURES FOR THESE THREE ENTITIES FOR CD TFA B. O. E. N. O. T. A. FROM JUST BEFORE THE MAJOR CHANGES AND- THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TENTY TWO. AND SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS AND- WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE. HELLO THIS IS NICK MADURO'S DIRECTOR OF C. T. F. A. OKAY SO MUCH. I'M I'VE HAS. CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NICK WITH AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN YOU TODAY WITH AN UPDATE ON THE STATE OF THE DEPARTMENT SINCE ITS CREATION UNDER AB ONE OH TWO. FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO WORK ALONGSIDE THE AMAZING TEAM AT CD TFA. PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE MANY ISSUES THAT EXISTED UPON THE DEPARTMENT'S CREATION. WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON FAIRLY AND EFFICIENTLY ADMINISTERING THE THIRTY SEVEN SOON TO BE THIRTY EIGHT. TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS IN OUR PURVIEW. WELL WE'RE ALWAYS STRIVING TO IMPROVE I AM PLEASED TO REPORT WE'VE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS. CLOSE LONGSTANDING AUDIT FINDINGS ENHANCE INTERNAL CONTROLS WOULD BE LAW MORE TRANSPARENT. INCLUDING BY PROVIDING THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO AN OPEN DATA PORTAL IT'S A GREAT RESOURCE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN CALIFORNIA'S. OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE'VE UNIFIED THE DEPARTMENT'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHERE PREVIOUSLY TAXPAYERS COULD GET DIFFERENT TREATMENT DEPENDING UPON WHICH REGION OF THE STATE THEY- AS THE COMMITTEE KNOWS. WE'VE WE'VE MOVED ALL OF OUR TAX PROGRAMS OFF OF THE OLD MAINFRAME AND ONTO OUR NEW CENTRALIZED REVENUE OPPORTUNITY SYSTEM ACROSS. THE PROJECT CAME IN ON TIME AND UNDER BUDGET AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT OF THAT VITAL EFFORT. LET ME TAKE JUST A MINUTE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPROVED EFFICIENCY GAINS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. ALMOST ACROSS THE BOARD PROCESSING TIMES HAVE BEEN CUT DRAMATICALLY. LOOKING AT OUR REFUNDS FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN I FIRST STARTED I GET CALLS FROM TAXPAYERS DESPERATE FOR REFUND CHECKS. ONE HOLIDAY SEASON THAT FIRST CHRISTMAS I WAS IN THE JOB I GOT A CALL FROM A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO WAS DESPERATE HIS REFUND BECAUSE HE NEEDED IT TO AFFORD. CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FOR HIS KIDS. IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN JUST ELEVEN POINT 8% OF REFUND CLAIM WERE PER. WITH THIRTY DAYS. THIS YEAR WE'RE- 80% OF OUR REFUND CLAIMS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS THE MAJORITY OF THOSE. WITHIN TEN DAYS. OUR PETITIONS. ALSO SEEM HUGE IMPROVEMENTS CITIES AND COUNTIES SUBMIT PETITIONS FOR REDISTRIBUTION WHEN THEY THINK A TAXPAYER HAS MISSED ALLOCATED LOCAL TAX ON THEIR RETURN. WE LITERALLY HAD CASES IN THE BACKLOG OVER ALMOST TWO DECADES OLD. THE TEAM HAS WORKED HARD AND SMART- TO REDUCE THAT INVENTORY BY NEARLY 75% WE'RE GETTING MORE DONE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE. SIMILARLY IN ARE TRYING TO PROCESS OFFERS IN COMPROMISE WHICH ALLOW TAXPAYERS WITH LIMITED MEANS TO SATISFY OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES. THE PROCESSING TIME IS DROPPED FROM SIX TO TEN MONTHS TO UNDER THIRTY DAYS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE GREAT WORK THE TEAM IS DOING AND ALL OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS CONTINUE TO FEED ON ONE ANOTHER DRIVING FURTHER PRODUCTIVITY GAINS. THROUGH A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUR OPERATIONS WE'VE MANAGED TO DO MORE WITH LESS. REVENUE IN THE PROGRAMS WE ADMINISTER HAS GROWN FROM SEVENTY POINT FOUR BILLION IN FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OUR FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION. TWO EIGHTY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION LAST FISCAL YEAR AND WE ANTICIPATE THIS YEAR WILL BE UP CLOSE TO NINETY BILLION. OVER THAT TIME THE COST ADMINISTER HAS DROPPED FROM EIGHTY FOUR CENTS PER HUNDRED DOLLARS IN REVENUE. IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO THIS YEAR WHEN WE THINK THAT NUMBER WILL BE BELOW SEVENTY CENTS PER HUNDRED DOLLARS IN REVENUE. AT ONE SOURCE OF THE SAVINGS HAS BEEN OUR PERSONNEL COSTS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEES HAD CONCERNS. IN THE PAST REGARDING VACANCIES OF COURSE WE'RE ALWAYS HIRING BUT WE ARE NOW FOCUSED ON HIRING ONLY WHERE THE POSITION IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED. AND WE'RE FOCUSED ON STREAMLINING OUR PROCESSES FIRST SO WE ARE JUST HIRING PEOPLE INTO AND IF INEFFICIENT SYSTEM. OUR NATURAL VACANCY RATE IS RUNNING A BIT HIGHER THAN USUAL AT THE MOMENT WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF RETIREMENTS IT SEEMS PEOPLE POSTPONED RETIREMENTS DURING COVERT WHEN THEY- AT. COULDN'T GO ON TRIPS AFTER THEY- RETIRED TREATMENTS ARE PROVING MORE DIFFICULT THAN IN THE PAST I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL SEEN THE NOW HIRING SIGNS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND IN FACT THEIR FAST FOOD JOBS THEY'RE NOW. PAYING MORE THAN MANY OF OUR ENTRY LEVEL TAX JOBS AND THOSE ARE LEADING TO SOME INCREASED VACANCIES. WE ARE THOUGH COMMITTED TO WORKING TO RIGHT SIZE OUR TEAM AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT POSITIONS TO GET THE WORK DONE AND- YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO FIGURE OUT BUT THAT RIGHT NUMBER SHOULD BE. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ME STAFF IS NOT EFFORT PROGRESSES AS WELL. THAT'S A DIFFICULT LONG TERM PROJECT THOUGH AND IT'S EVEN MORE COMPLICATED GIVEN THAT OUR GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION IMPACTS FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM SPECIAL TAX FUNDS. AND FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON WHOSE BEHALF WITH MINISTER THE BRADLEY BURNS AND DISTRICT TAXES. IN CONCLUSION. THE TEAM AT CTF. HAS DONE A GREAT JOB IN THE FACE OF REAL HEADWINDS INCLUDING THE PANDEMIC OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE WHOLE TEAM FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK. AND LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. I'D BE HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT. ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR NEXT PENALISES MARC I BILL DIRECTOR OF OTA. YEAH. WE GO AHEAD AND SHARE. IT MARKER MERRIAM- E. R. IF YOU'D LIKE US TO.

AND IT'S A BUDGET REQUEST- WE CAN WE CAN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WERE HAPPEN ANY ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON. THE GOINGS ON AT OTA WE ARE GOING TO REVERT TO IN PERSON HEARINGS IN THE NEXT MONTH AND- WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR REMOTE HEARINGS AS WELL. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE ANY INTENTIONAL. THAT- THE COMMITTEE HAD AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU WE WANT TO BRING THE FLEMING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WEEK. GOOD AFTERNOON I'D SHARE CARILLO AND OPERABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM AND THE FLEMING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S. DISCUSSIONS HAVING BEEN WITH THE B. O. B. SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN I BELIEVE THAT I DO HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE TO OFFER TO TODAY'S DISCUSSION. HAVING EXPERIENCED THE BEFORE DURING AND AFTER OF THE ENACTMENT OF AB ONE OH TWO AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. PLEASE ALLOW ME MEMBERS TO PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF HISTORY AND ALL STAFF IS GONE THROUGH ALREADY A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BEER WE AS YOU KNOW AND AS WAS STATED. IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE BILL WE WAS A STAFFERS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION TO OVERSEE CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM. IN ESSENCE MEMBERS WE ARE CHARGED TO ENSURE EQUAL AND FAIR ASSESSMENT AND VALUATION OF PROPERTY. W. E. IS THE ONLY ELECTED TAX FOR IN THE COUNTRY AND IS COMPRISED OF FOUR EQUALIZATION DISTRICT MEMBERS AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER. OVER THE PAST CENTURY WE ALWAYS RESPONSIBILITIES WERE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE TWO ADDITIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS AND OVER THIRTY STATUTORY AND FREE PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE SALES AND USE TAX PROGRAM. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LEGISLATION REFER ARTS THE CONSTITUTION PROGRAMS AND AS WE STATED BEFORE THAT'S PROPERTY TAX THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX. AND THE TAX ON INSURERS. THE RESPONSES. ARE CURRENT SUPPORT BY A- TWO. EMPLOYEES WHO PERFORM A RANGE ROLES. INCLUDING TAX ADMINISTRATION FUNCTIONS LEGAL STATE ADMINISTRATION TAXPAYER RIGHTS ADVOCACY COMMUNICATIONS E. AND A FEW MORE. OUR CURRENT VACANCY RATE IS APPROXIMATELY RECRUITMENTS AND ACTIVE OUR PROGRESS. WITH A REFINED SCOPE OF TAX PROGRAMS THE VIEW WE CONTINUES TO AFFECTED RIGHT MINISTER ARE TAX PROGRAMS WHAT GREATER EFFICIENCIES AND QUOTING STRENGTHENING OUR WORKFORCE INVESTING IN OUR SUBJECT ATTER EXPERTISE AND PROVING AND REFINING OUR PROCESS THESE MODERNIZING OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ENRICHING OUR TAXPAYER EDUCATION AND OUTREACH DUTIES. THIS IS ALL TO ENSURE THAT OUR TAXPAYERS AND CALIFORNIA'S AT LARGE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES WHICH SUPPORT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OUT WITH THIRTY SIX POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE AN ADDITIONAL FORTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS. THIS BY THE WAY IS A SIX INCREASE OVER FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY. TO CONTINUE MEMBERS AND TERMS OF EFFICIENCIES GAINED CENTS TO RESTRUCTURE YES THERE ARE SOME. MOST NOTABLY AS OUR OPERATIONAL AGILITY. A SMALLER INCLUDES A REDUCED HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE. THAT FLATTER ORGANIZATION MAKES DECISION MAKING. POLICY DEVELOPMENT SUCCESSION PLANNING MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS AND OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR STAFF SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AGILE AND MUCH MORE HANDS ON. THIS BENEFIT IS PROVING TO BE A SPECIALLY HELPFUL MEMBERS FROM WHEN THE INITIAL STAY AT HOME ORDER WORK PHASE BEGAN TO DOUBT DURING THIS EMERGING TELEWORK HYBRID WORK MODEL. THESE OPERATE EFFICIENCY HAPPEN THE- WITH ITS BECAUSE- PRO. MORE AND OF. BRIEFLY IF I MAY OUR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX AND TAX ON INSURERS PROGRAMS CONTINUES FOLLOWING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LEGISLATION. THE DIFFERENCE NOW MEMBERS IS THAT SOME SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE TAX COLLECTION PROCEDURES FOR THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX PROGRAM ARE OUTSOURCED VIA AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENTS TO CD TFA. THAT'S LINE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF GOVERNMENT CODE FIFTEEN FIVE SEVENTY DOT THIRTY ONE. THERE ARE EFFICIENCIES GAINED WITH THIS APPROACH RESULTING FROM CITY TO HAVE BASED TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND THEIR TAX BILL HAND COLLECTION EXPERTISE. AND IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH NICK. IN FACT OTHER STATE AGENCIES HAVE SIMILAR INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS FOR CITY CHAIRED A SERVICES AS WELL. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE B. ONLY REMAINS CONSTITUTIONALLY AND JURISDICTION WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FUNCTIONS IN ADDITION TO BE A WEEK DIRECTLY PERFORMS.% ALL LEGAL AND JUDICIARY FUNCTIONS THE APPEALS FOR COUNTRY FANS REDETERMINATION DIALS EXCEPT FOR THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX AND TAX AND INSURANCE PROGRAMS. WE ALSO PERFORMED THE TAXPAYER RIGHTS ADVOCATES SERVICES FOR THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX. AND TRUMP'S MEMBERS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SEATS IF I AS YOU KNOW AS OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN STATUTE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION FIFTEEN FIVE SEVENTY DOT TWENTY EIGHT WORDS GOODNIGHT CD TFA SUPERVISED BE A WEEK WITH ADMINISTRATIVE AND PERSONNEL SERVICES WHICH INCLUDE. BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING IN GENERAL FINANCE FUNCTIONS CONTRACTS AND ACQUISITIONS FACILITIES TECHNOLOGY SERVICES JUST TO NAME A FOR YOU. WE APPRECIATE THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR PARTNERS AND WHILE THE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE HEALTHY AND FINE THE CHALLENGES ARE SIMPLY RELATED TO WORK WHAT. COMPETE PRIORITIES WORKFORCE CITY INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD AS YOU CAN IMAGINE- PROCESSING WORK ACROSS. TWO DISTINCT AGENCIES. BLACK MEMBERS I MANY OTHERS AGENTS. HIS FACE IS A CHALLENGE. TO LIVE A SENSE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE SPECIFICALLY IN OUR PROPERTY TAX AREA. DUE TO RETIREMENTS CAREER CHANGES BOTH PRE AND POST PANDEMIC AND OTHER WORKFORCE ATTRITION FACTORS. THIS FACTORS COUPLED WITH AN AGE AND OUTDATED JOB CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION MODEL THIS TOPIC IS OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF TODAY'S HEARING I DO UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT'S WORTHY TO NOTE AS WELL AS WELL AS WE ALL WORK TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM CONTINUES TO THRIVE BY DEVELOPING A TRACKING THE NEXT GENERATION OF EXPERTS TO THIS INDUSTRY. TO CONCLUDE MEMBERS. LOOKING BACK TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO NOW MANY OF OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED. ALL THE ISSUES THAT TRIGGER THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN RESTRUCTURE HAVE BEEN REMEDY I COOPER LEGISLATION AFFECTED POLICIES AND CONTROLS STRONG LEADERSHIP AND A PROFESSIONAL WORKFORCE WILL PERFORM THEIR DUTIES WITH GREAT INTEGRITY. DO WE HAS CONTINUED TO DELIVER ITS ESSENTIAL SERVICES FOR THE BENEFIT OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTIONS OR DELAYS AND THIS IS A TESTAMENT TO THE WORK AT EACH AND EVERY YEAR WE EMPLOY. AND THE LEADERSHIP OF HER FOR. THIS CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON AGO CRYSTAL DEPARTMENT FINDING HI HOW NO ADDITIONAL STOMPED WITH PREVIOUS- SPEAKERS WITH BUT I AVAILABLE DONT ANSWER AND MEMBERS HALF THE YOU SOME OF. TO THANK MISTER CHAIR- JUST APPRECIATE A THE- ALL THE CALL FROM ALL THE PER HAS. LET ME JUST SAY THE MISS MILLER. MADURO'S- WILL REALLY REALLY DO YOU TOOK OVER THE DEPARTMENT- THERE WAS DEFINITE ISSUES TO HEAR. ABOUT THE PROGRESS THAT YOU MADE TO USE MADE SO FAR WITH EXISTING STAFFING AND WITH- YOU KNOW DURING A PANDEMIC OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. VERY PROUD THAT IT- FURTHER. AS WELL AS AB ONE THIRTY ONE SO REALLY DO APPRECIATE- YOUR WORK TO MAKE THE AGENCY MORE TRANSPARENT- MORE OPEN AND ALSO JUST- PROVIDING FASTER. AND STRONGER CUSTOMER SERVICE SERVICES SO THANK YOU I'M I DID HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR MISS- MISS FLEMING. SO CAN CAN YOU WALK- WALKTHROUGH FOR THE FOR ELECTED- YOUR FOR BOARD MEMBERS HOW HOW MANY STAFF DO THEY HAVE EACH I BELIEVE IT'S FOR. CURRENTLY THANK YOU- ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND ARE CURRENTLY ARE UP FOR EQUALIZATION DISTRICT MEMBERS HAVE A DISPUTE EXEMPTS POSITIONS CLASS FOR A RANK AND FILE EMPLOYEES FOR A TOTAL OF SIX EMPLOYEES PER MEMBER. GOT IT THANK YOU I THINK IT CAN YOU JUST TERM WALK THROUGH THEIR- THEIR DUTIES AT THIS POINT IN TERMS OF- WHAT THEIR DAY TO DAY- SORT OF. BROAD BRUSHSTROKES DUTIES ARE. ABSOLUTELY SO I THEIR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE ELECTED BOARD- REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY A TEN MILLION BECAUSE THAT DISTRICTS ANY CONVERSATION DISTRICT OF TEN MILLION OUR CONSTITUENTS- EACH OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS THE OBSERVATORY FUNCTION ALONG WITH THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION FOR THE PROPERTY TAX ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX AND TAX AND INSURANCE PROGRAM SO SITTING AS THE BOARD- THEY ARE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE- POLICY MAKING PROCESS. APPROVING AND REVIEWING ON THE RGULATIONS APPROVING AND REVIEWING FORMS AS WE ON THE COUNTY ASSESS PROPERTIES LEVELS INTERACT WITH THE UP FIFTY COUNTY ASSESSOR'S SO THEIR ROLE IN TERMS OF DAY TO DAY IS TO ALSO ENGAGE WITH TAXPAYERS WILL REACH OUT TO THEIR OFFICE IS ON A PRETTY REGULAR BASIS. I'M TO HAVE MORE LOCALIZED OF QUESTIONS OR ISSUES THAT THEY NEED ASSISTANCE WITH AND PARTNER WITH US ON A REGULAR BASIS TO LOOK AT OUR A BROAD RANGE OF MATTERS IT'S RELEASED WITH SYSTEM TAXPAYERS BE MORE AND FARMS AND AWARE OF THE OUT OF THE TAX POLICIES- AND THE BENEFITS THAT THE- THE CITIZENS ARE ENTITLED TO- THEY ALSO REVIEWED JUST TO MAKE SHORT OF THE ORGANIZATION IS OPERATING EFFICIENTLY. ESPECIALLY AFTER THE AB ONE OH TWO TWENTY SEVENTEEN LEGISLATION ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MODERNIZING- WORDS ARE IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGIES PROCESS THESE EXCEPT FOR A ARE ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT EVERY OTHER FISH AND SEE- INCLUDING- YOU KNOW. ANYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR WEBSITES EXCEPT FOR FURTHER THEIR VERY INVOLVED WORKING WITH THE I. FIFTY COUNTY ASSESSOR'S EACH EACH EQUALIZATION DISTRICT MEMBER HAS A DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION OF A COUNTY SUCH AS THAT THEY WORK WITH BUT THEY PARTNER HAPPILY THERE- TO TAKE A LOOK AT- YOU KNOW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED AS WE MODERNIZE OUR PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE RECENTLY HAD A NUMBER OF HEARINGS- UNDER A CODE IN THE STATE HOME THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE COUNTIES- SPECIFICALLY. LIKE ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD FOR EXAMPLE AND THE BOARD WAS. I'M VERY. IN PROVIDING. TO BRING ALL OF THOSE PARTIES. TO ENGAGE AND STUDIES TO EXAMINE WHAT MIGHT BE SOME GAPS ARE. TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY AS AN AGENCY TO SEE WHAT WE COULD DO TO IMPROVE THOSE PROCESSES AGAIN FOR. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY IN THE STATEWIDE MINISTRATION THESE PROGRAMS. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS ARE. YES THANK YOU SO ON GO GO BACK TO I THINK YOU'RE TO. WHERE YOU STARTED WAS THERE I DO GOOD I MEAN SOUNDS LIKE THEIR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY. A SIMILAR TO THE PASS IS REALLY THEIR ADJUDICATORY- FUNCTION AND THEIR THEIR BODY AS- A HEARING- HEARING APPEALS IS THAT CORRECT. IT OF THE SIGNET PORTION OF THE RESPONSIBILITY CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY OF COURSE. AND GOOD GOVERNMENT HOW MANY ARE. YOU KNOW HOW HOW HOW MANY HEARINGS DO THEY HAVE ANNUALLY. ARE CURRENTLY WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STATUTE TO HAVE AT LEAST- ONE HEARING A MONTH SO WE HAVE TWELFTH- THERE ARE OCCASIONS WHEN WE HAVE AN INCREASED NUMBER OF HEARINGS. ARE DEPENDING ON THE ISSUE SOME DAYS SOME OF THE HEARING STARTS TWO DAYS A MONTH- BUT WE ARE WE HAVE- HEARINGS EVERY MONTH. GOT IN CAN BE CAN YOU TELL ME DURING THEM AMONG THE THIRD DURING A GIVEN YEAR HOW MANY. CASES ARE PETITIONS THEY WALL HERE. HI CAL SEASON PRIMARILY IN THANK YOU SIR AGAIN FOR THAT QUESTION RPL SEASONS AS PRIMARILY COVERED IN THE- THE OCTOBER OF THE APPEAL PROCESS IS A LOT LONGER THAN THAT. BUT IN TERMS OF SCHEDULING THOSE ITEMS BEFORE THE BOARD IS TYPICALLY THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE YEAR BETTER HEARING MOST OF THE APPEALS ACTUAL APPEALS- BUT THERE ARE ALSO- AND NOT APPEARANCE A TRIBUTARY MATTERS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO THEM. I FREQUENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WHERE SOME TAXPAYERS MAY WANT TO COME AND REYES ANYBODY ISSUES. AGAIN IN ADDITION ABOUT IN ADDITION TO THE OBSERVATORY THERE ARE THERE INVOLVED INRULE MAKING ACTIVITIES AND OVERSEEING THE- SO THERE IS A WAVE AT THAT THEIR COUNTY ASSESS PROCESS AND THE STATUS AS PROCESS HE'S- ADVISED. TO DISTINCT OUR LIFE CYCLES AND SO THERE'S WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. I DIDN'T HEAR A NUMBER FROM YOU. AND OF THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS OR-NO YOU HEARD DID YOU STATE OF THE NUMBER MEETINGS JUST- MANY. IMMIGRATION QUESTIONS PART. DO HEAR ON IN A TYPICAL THINK THAT'S- THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS LAST YEAR I THINK WE'VE HAD- INTRODUCED TOTAL WORKLOAD WE PROBABLY BROUGHT BEFORE THE BOARD- PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR ACTUAL BUT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL WORKLOAD RELATED TO THE APPEALS. BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF APPEALS GOING TO THE APPEALS PROCESS THAT ARE- EFFECT WILL BE ADMINISTERED AT AND OFFICIALLY MINISTER CHRISTOS WORK. SO WE MIGHT HAVE AT ANY POINT- ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY TO THIRTY APPEALS ARE PER YEAR. ALL OF THOSE CASES ARE POTENTIAL- ITEMS THAT COULD COME BEFORE THE BOARD OKAY SO YOU SEE YOUR THE- WHAT WE ARE TWITTER. DESCRIBING TO ME IS THE STAFF. WORKS FOR THE BOARD IS WORKING ON TWENTY TO THIRTY. HILLS BUT THE BOARD MEMBERS THEMSELVES ARE JUST HEARING ABOUT THREE TO FOUR APPEALS A YEAR. I'M SO IN RECENT HISTORY THAT SPEND THE WORKLOAD- AND AGAIN BUT AT THE TIME THAT THE APPEALS ARE THE PETITIONS ARE ARE APPROACHING US AT THAT POINT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THING WE WOULDN'T KNOW HOW MANY ARE ACTUALLY GONNA SHOW SO WE DO PROCESS ALL OF THOSE WITH THE POTENTIAL OF THE COULD BE COMING BEFORE THE BOARD. BUT THE WEATHER'S A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE WORKS- THAT'S HANDLED BY THE STAFF NOT PROPERLY SO. OKAY BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY DO TWENTY FOUR. WHERE TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE REQUIRED- TO ASSIST ON FOR APPEALS A YEAR. IT'S CURRENTLY AND STATUTES ARE. IN TERMS OF THEIR TERRITORY FUNCTION. SO THAT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY LIKE THIS BY THE BY THE STAFF. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT. SO I APPRECIATE THAT SO THE STAFFING LEVELS- AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE- AND INVITES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEDGE ON US OFFICE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PORTION OF THE DISCUSSION THERE WAS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TIME FRAMES HER ARM AFTER THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LEGISLATION WHERE THERE WAS A STUDY DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT IT TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN THE HIGHER BOARD THAT CONSISTED OF A TWELVE POSITIONS FOR EACH MEMBER. ARMINA FINANCES A PART OF A LETTER PROCESS EXAMINES THE WORKLOAD AND THE NUMBER OF VACANCY ON THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS IN EACH MEMBER'S OFFICE- BASED UPON THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND L. A. O. THE NUMBER THAT WAS DETERMINED AND APPROVED IN STATUTE- ENDED UP WITH A REDUCTION FROM TWELFTH. POSITIONS PER MEMBER TO SIX. AND SO THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT- BROUGH THE STATUTE WE ARE WORKING WITH CURRENTLY DOES MISTER HILL WANNACRY ON WHETHER HE THINKS IT'S A- IT'S OUR- GOOD USE OF TAXPAYER. TO HAVE- FOR BOARD MEMBERS AND TWENTY FOUR STAFF WORKING ON FOUR FIELD HERE. NOT WORKING ON THE TO HEAR FOUR PILLS A YEAR. MISTER HELP THANK YOU RYSTAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS MISS FUNDING INDICATED WE DID DO A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. IT WAS A STAFFING STUDY REQUIRED AB ONE OF TWO TO GET A BETTER IDEA AS TO THE STAFFING RESOURCES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE REDEFINED BORDER EQUALIZATION AND THEIR NEW MISSION. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT STUDY WE INITIALLY FOUND THE NEED FOR- TWO SIX DEPOSITIONS AND FIVE CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS. AND UPON FURTHER OR WORK FOR THE LEGISLATIVE PROMPT PROCESS AND WORK WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE WE STUMBLE UPON A FINAL NUMBER ATKINS FUNDING INDICATED OF. TWO EXAMPLES WERE SPECIFIED IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION AND THEN O CIVIL SERVICE STAFF. AND WE HAVE NOT REVISITED THE- STOPPING STUDIES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN BOTTOM. ARE STANDING AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN WE DID THAT WAS THAT WAS APPROPRIATE LEVEL. OF STAFFING BASED ON ANTICIPATED. BUT THE BOARD MEMBERS WOULD. IT MISTER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILL INTO THE WORKED- WELL THE INTEREST WORK WAS BASED ON. THE NUMBER I CAN'T I'M SORRY IT'S BEEN SEVERAL YEARS SINCE WE DID THE STUDY BUT- IN ANTICIPATED APPEALS AND THEN THERE'S ALSO OTHER FACTORS LIKE- IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THESE ARE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS EACH FROM HAVE TEN MILLION APPROXIMATELY CONSTITUENTS. WE NEED TO WORK AT THEIR CONSTITUENTS ON ON MATTERS OF- JUST CONSTITUENT CORRESPONDENCE TYPE ISSUES- SO THERE WAS THE TOTALITY OF THE APPEALS WORK LOAD. THE TASKS AND HERRON AND- HELPING TO ADMINISTER THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND THEIR TASKS AND ALSO HANDLING CONSTITUENT WORK LOAD THAT WE'VE SETTLED UPON BEYOND. TO EXEMPTS YOUNGER FOR CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS. BUT NOW THAT THE APPEALS WORKLOAD IS DOWN TO FOR A YEAR WHEN I THINK FOR A MONTH PERCENT FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR- THAT SEEMS TO PROBABLY BE AN APPEALS WORKLOAD THAT PROBABLY WAS MUCH LOWER THAN WE HAD ALL ANTICIPATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OR TWENTY EIGHTEEN- IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WORK LOAD HOUSE OF WALL FROM WHAT WE ANTICIPATED IT WOULD BE FORTY YEARS AGO. AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE WISHES TO ON INVESTIGATE THIS FURTHER THE ADMINISTRATION BE HAPPY TO- WORK WITH B. O. IN THE LEGISLATURE TO- DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS- STILL THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF STAFFING GIVE EXISTING. MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THAT MR HELL BENT BIGGEST GO BACK TO MISS MISS FLEMING SO THEN- SO THEN THE- IMAGE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER I ASSUME IS WHEN YOU'RE HEARING THEM. THE HILLS LET'S SAY WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT THE OTHER THREE QUARTERS IN THE TWELVE MEETINGS AND ANY OTHER NINE MEETINGS OR HEARINGS SO I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION SIR AGAIN THANK YOU SO I VALUE SETTING IS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE WORK THAT'S DONE SO- THAT OCCURS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ALONG WITH THE SALVATION TAX RATES UP FOR OUR PRIVATE RENTAL CAR TAX. AND ROADS- THERE ARE A RANGE OF CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTIONS- AND ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR ON ARC AGENDA EVERY MONTH- AGAIN FORMS OR SOMETHING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND UPSKILL SIR JUST TO CLARIFY IF I MAY THE APPEALS PROCESS BASICALLY IN THE PROPERTY TAX WERE PRIMARILY BILLS FOURTH ORNAMENTS ARE PRIMARILY THE STATE ASSESSED APPEALS SO THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF THE WORK IN THE COUNTY AS AS ONE COULD APPRECIATE WORKING WITH A FIFTY COUNT YES SIR OVER THE STATE- THERE IS REGULAR WORKING ISSUES THAT THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S RAISING ON A REGULAR BASIS AND PART OF OUR WORK SO. EXAM THE THINGS THAT I WAS MISTER MISTER KIRSTEN'S PRESENTE WAS THE PASSAGE IN THE AN IMPLEMENTATION OF ABOUT NINETEEN THAT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF WORK THAT DIDN'T EXIST IN TWENTY. SEVEN BUT AGAIN ASSEMBLY WORK. NOW OFFICE AND TWENTY NO. AND SO THEY CAME ON. OF THIS TIME THAT LED. WAS PASSED AND SO ALL OF THE SIGNET WORK AT THEIR- AND- TO LOOK AT- HAS TO DO WITH THE PROP NINETEEN IMPLEMENTATION IN THERE'S A BROAD RANGE OF TAXPAYERS AS I'M SURE- THIS BODY IS AWARE OF THAT THEIR BROAD RANGE OF QUESTIONS- AND WORK THAT'S NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THAT TAX PROGRAMS. ARE BOARD MEMBERS ARE FRONT AND CENTER AND PARTICIPATING IN THOSE TAXPAYERS BECAUSE TAXPAYERS ARE CALLING THEIR- ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES TO UNDERSTAND THAT. SELL FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE HERE'S- THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR WE HAVE THE IN TERMS OF COUNTY SAYS THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR PROCESS THEY'RE LOOKING AT. ARE AT EACH WILL GET. EACH LEAN DATE DURING AN EXAMINATION OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE ON A ROLL WITH THEM BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE SECOND THIRD QUARTER WERE HEAVILY AS OF SEPT FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER. WE'RE DOING AN EXAMINATION OF THE ROLE OF THE BOARD HAS TO ADOPT THAT- BURKE ASSOCIATED FACT THAT IS TAKEN UP ON THE AGENDA- EVERY MONTH THAT I PRISON SUPPORT IN TERMS OF. THE ANSWER ASSOCIATED OUTBOARD ROLE A LOCAL PORK ROLL- TAXES- SO THERE'S A BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS A LOT OF TIMES IT HAS TO DO WITH FORMS AND JUST EXACT PROCESS THESE. AREN'T THAT GOOD COUNTY SAYS DRIVES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK THAT IS IT'S A DIFFERENT BOTH HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK- IT'S JUST THE CYCLES FOR STATUS HAS BEEN COUNTY ASSESSOR LITTLE BIT THERE. BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD- THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING THROUGH A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY CHANGE WERE ALL DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY WORK FORCE. SO THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S RAISING A NUMBER OF ISSUE- TO US PERCENT OR BOARD LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE AS WE'RE DOING OUR OUR OUR SETTLEMENT. SURVEYS FOR EXAMPLE ALL THAT WORK ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S CONSISTENCY. SO THAT THERE'S THAT FIRST AND SEE WHAT THE MARKET IS CHANGING IN TERMS OF. MAYBE SOME OF THE THAT MORE- SEASONED AND EXPERIENCED APPRAISERS AND ASSESSORS ARE LEAVING HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT. THOUSAND ON THE BOARD EXISTING. ROLE IN ENSURE- THAT THOSE. ARE INTACT AND SO BASED ON THE COST. DUTIES PROVIDE. YOU KNOW. FOR ALL OF THAT AND IN NUMBER OF WAYS. I'M WORKING WITH THAT BOTH COUNTY. TO HAS TO. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS OR THE WORK OF THE STAFF. I THINK IT WAS FROM IT WAS A OTHER FOR. COUNTY SAN VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BOARD DUTIES ARE REGARDS THE COUNTIES- AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT- YOU KNOW YOU DEFINITELY HAVE LAWYERS ON THIS. WHO ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE YOU DO HAVE STAFF MEMBERS WHO REGULARLY ATTEND OUR CONFERENCES AND REGULAR- YOUR LEADERS AND EXPERTS AND OBVIOUSLY YOU MENTIONED THE- SURVEYS OR YOU KNOW WE THINK OF THEM AS AUDITS BUT HE SURVEYS THAT YOU DO REGULARLY- BUT THOSE ARE THE- THE STAFF FUNCTIONS- IT DOESN'T SEEM. THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS- TRADITIONALLY WAR EVER VERY MUCH INVOLVED VERY SPECIFICALLY- AND ANY OF THOSE- PARTICULAR ITEMS OBVIOUSLY I MEAN THAT THAT THAT THE LONG HISTORY WITH THE BOARD TO RESCIND THEIR IN THE CONSTITUTION AND- THE REASON THE ASSESSORS ARE ELECTED OF. BILLS YOU KNOW FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY SENSE WAS ELECTED IS BECAUSE OF ALL THE SCANDALS WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AROUND PROPERTY TAXES AND- TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. AND TO REALLY PROVIDE OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY UNFORTUNATELY PRIOR TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I THINK YOU HEARD OR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST SORT OF- REFER TO THAT- THE BOARD INSTEAD OF BECAUSE OF BEING A BEACON OF OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY AND REALLY- PROVIDING I THINK WITH THE VISION WAS WHEN IT WAS CREATED OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO- REALLY FELL INTO MATT. SAID PROPS THAT THEY WERE CREATED TO SOLVE SO- TO ME IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT. WITH THE REDUCE DUTIES- THIS THE STAFFING LEVELS ESPECIALLY FOR THE FOR THE FOUR BOARD MEMBER SEEMS PRETTY- WITHOUT- PRETTY OVERSTAFFED- I ASSUME THAT AGAIN THAT THE DUTIES OF THE INTERNAL STAFF SEEM YOU KNOW PROBABLY ARE. ARE CONTINUE TO BE APPROPRIATE BUT AT LEAST FOR THE. FOR ELECTED BOARD MEMBERS ARE PROBABLY IS IT'S TIME TO TAKE A LOOK- HELLO VIEW. AND TO REALLY TRULY WHAT THERE IS TO A MORE. EFFICIENT USE OF GOVERNMENT DOLLARS AND THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO REALLY SPEND- OUR GOVERNMENT- YEAH ARE ARE REALLY GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN. WE'RE REALLY LOOKING OUT OF A WIDE VARIETY OF- THINGS IN OUR BUDGET SUB- WITHOUT THING IF I MAY. ASSEMBLY EMBER TEAM IF I MAY RESPOND TO THAT- AND I DO APPRECIATE COMICS. AND YOUR EXPOSURE I STARTED WORKING AS A DEBATE BUT OKAY YOU CAN RESPOND. OKAY THAT'S DOT DOT DOT INTENSELY BAY BUT DECIDED CLARIFY I'M JUST LISTENING TO AND AGAIN HAVING BEEN THERE BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THE LEGISLATION MY DIRECT EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE WHAT WE REFER TO SIR S. B. O. IN ONE .ORG. WE HAVE AS WE'VE HEARD IN TODAY'S HEARING WE HAD. OVER THIRTY TAX PROGRAMS INCLUDING. INCOME TAX CORPORATE TAX AND THE SALES AND USE TAX. AND SO STUDENTS TO BE FRANK- THE RANGE OF ISSUES RELATED TO THOSE OTHER TWO TAX PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOW- ADMINISTERED BY C. HFA. THOSE ARE KIND OF THE VERY- DEMANDING ERY VERY DAILY ACTIVE OPERATIONALLY ACTIVE. TAX PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE REVENUE GENERATION. WHEN WE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT DID REDUCE THE SCOPE OF THE TAX PROGRAMS. BUT IT ALSO ALLOW THE BOARD TO REALLY DO AS A DEFINITE DRILL DOWN CLOSER EXAMINATION OF PROPERTY TAX WHICH QUITE FRANKLY SIR OVER THE YEARS. HAD NOT WITH THE PRIOR BOARDS RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL OF THE BAD THE OTHER SEXY TAX PROGRAMS IF YOU WELL. I ONE THOUSAND USED TAX PRIMARILY IN INCOME TAX SO WHAT'S THE LEGISLATION PASSED IT REALLY DID GIVE THIS BOARD AND STAFF AN OPPORTUNITY. TO FOCUS ON PROPERTY TAX AS THE PRIMARY TAX PROGRAM AND IT'S THAT EXAMINATION ABOUT VERY IMPORTANT TAX PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS A CLOSER EXAMINATION THAT PROGRAMMER THIS BOARD HAS ENGAGED JOINT SHORT THAT IT IS INVESTIGATING- BECAUSE THEY A PRIOR BOARDS- PRIOR TO AB WANT TO. DEFINITELY PAID A LOT OF ATTENTION. TO SURE THEY WORK IN GENERAL. ARE AND- AND STAFF EXCEPT FOR THE FOR THE OTHER PROGRAM THAT WERE DOT FOR PROPERTY TAX. AND PAUL. WANTED TO THAT HAS OUR SHIP IN FOCUS PRIORITIES. IT IS THE PRIME TAX- THAT THAT MOST OF OUR STAFF FOR ALLOCATED AND SO THE BOARD HAS BEEN VERY MUCH. A STRONG AS WITH THE SITTING BOARD WITH REALLY FOCUSING- ON ALL OF A. B. TWO B. AB ONE OH TO ROLL OUT- RESPONSIBILITIES- AS THE FIRST ONE THAT IS FULLY AB WANT TO THE PRIOR BOARD STILL HAD A FEW RECALL A LITTLE BIT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THEY STILL HAVE SOME SOME LEFTOVER APPEALS WORK SO I'M JUST IT TO JENNIFER AND DID TO REACH STATE AND TO CONCLUDE. THIS PART IS FOCUSED ON PROPERTY TAX BECAUSE IT HAVE BEEN- ALLEN CONNECTED OVER THE YEARS BUT CERTAINLY NEEDED MORE ATTENTION WHICH WAS NOT GIVEN TO IT AND IT'S DUE ATTENTION. WHEN WE WERE FOCUSING ON THE OTHER PROGRAMS OF THIS PORT IS BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN A WIDE RANGE OF THOSE THOSE. THOSE FUNCTIONS. CAN YOU ARM TALK THE FOR BORDER TWENTY THE HAVE ANY. PROPER TAX. PER TO BE ON THE BOARD. THANK YOU HAVE A COMBINATION PROPERTY TAX EXPERIENCE IN OFFICES YES SIR. CAN YOU EXPAND ON THAT. SO FOR EXAMPLE- AS IN AND MISS COLLINS DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE IN DISTRICT TWO- AND- SPECIFICALLY AND FOR EXAMPLE DISTRICT THREE WHICH IS A TINY ON VASQUEZ'S DISTRICT- BOTH OF THOSE HAVE STAFF THAT WORKED WITH US BEFORE- AND ALSO HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PERRANCE WHAT THEY'VE WORKED. VERY CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE WITH THE COUNTY CITY AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS AND BOTH HAVE- EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THEIR OF THEIR LOCAL- COUNTY ASSESSORS- AT AND K. THE REPRESENTATIVE SALT FROM HIS CALLING FOR EXAMPLE AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH THAT WITH THE CURRENT ASSESSMENT THE PRIOR ASSESSOR CARMEN CHU. SIMILARLY MISTER VASQUEZ WORKED CLOSELY WITH THAT WHAT'S THE HOTTEST L. A. COUNTY ASSESSOR JEFFREY PRANG- SO THEY ALSO INCLUDE STAFF SIR THAT CONTINUED WITHIN THE RANK AND FILE STAFF AND SOME OF. THE EXEMPTS STAFF ALSO. MY QUESTION WAS AND THERE ARE NO. OF PROPERTY THE WITHOUT UP NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE TO ANY OF THE FOUR. ELECTED MEMBERS HAVE ANY- WORK EXPERIENCE IN THE PROPERTY TAX ARENA- AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE OUR RANGE OF EXPERIENCES THAT THEY HAVE THAT THAT WHILE THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE DEEP LEVEL OF EXPERTISE. ONE THAT WAS MY QUESTION AS TO MY KNOWLEDGE I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THEM HAVE- PROPERTY TAX IT WORK EXPERTS. OKAY THANK YOU SIR OKAY SO YOU'RE NOT DISPUTING THAT- BUT- I GOT GOING GOING BACK AGAIN IF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT ARE REALLY IN CHARGE OF DOING THE ASSESSMENT AND THE COLLECTION OF PROPERTY TAXES THE BELIEVES IS THERE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE UTILITIES AND THE RAILROADS BUT THEY'RE THERE TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT VERY DIFFERENT FUNCTION THAN. WHAT YOU HAD FOR YOUR OTHER INCOME TAXES IN YOUR OTHER I USED TAXES WHERE THE BOARD'S ACTUALLY COLLECTING THOSE TAXES SO- I THINK IT DOES- AS WE SEE NOW REALLY CALL INTO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT- THERE REALLY IS A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO. TO DO THIS- THIS LAST PART OF THE JOB WHICH THE BOARD HAS BEEN CONSTITUTIONALLY AS YOU SAID I TASK WITH WHICH IS REALLY TO HEAR PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND MAKE SURE THERE IS- THERE THE PROPERLY ADMINISTERING PROPERTY TAXES IN THOSE FIFTY ACCOUNTS PROVIDING THAT OVERSIGHT SO. AGAIN APPRECIATE. YOU BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I APPRECIATE THAT SIR I'LL MAKE I THINK THE BOARD HAS SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND- AND HAVE A ROLE IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE- OTHER CITIZENS THAT THEY REPRESENT FOR THEIR STATE- I HAVE AN UNOFFICIAL TO ASSIST WITH THAT PROCESS- BUT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMONSENSE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE DIESS MEMBERS FROM DIED. AT MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK A I THINK THE BUDGET CHAIR ASKED THE GREAT QUESTIONS AND SO I DON'T WANNA CONTINUE REPEATING SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND- MISS FUNDING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS THESE QUESTIONS ARE. LONGSTANDING ISSUES THAT AREN'T DIRECTED TO YOU BUT TO THE AGENCY AS WELL- THAT THE AGENCY AND WHOLE- I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK AND ASK SOMETHING VERY BASIC WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE BUILDING AT THIS POINT. AND HAVE ALL THE BOARD MEMBERS MOVED INTO THE BUILDING AT THIS POINT. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SIR- SO CURRENTLY- ARE BOARD MEMBERS ARE I'M HAVE TO ABIDE BY STATUTE OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW SIR- THEIR OFFICES EACH HAS AN OFFICE IN THEIR DISTRICTS AND EQUALIZATION DISTRICTS AND ALL OF THEM ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO AREA- IN TERMS OF THE BUILDING YEAH WE IT'S NO LONGER TERM ASSIGNMENTS ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE FOUR FIFTY INSTREAM STRUCTURE. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND NO LONGER- IS IN THE FOUR FIFTY AND ST THAT BUILDING IS NOW FULLY OCCUPIED BY THE- CD TFA- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONCE WE RESUME THEIR PUBLIC MEETINGS- WE STILL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING OUR OUR MONTHLY PUBLIC MEETINGS AND THE- THE BOARD ONE FORMER BOARD ROOM NOW REFERRED TO AS THE AUDITORIUM- BUT WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY AGENCY OR BOARD STAFF INTO FOUR FIFTY N. STREET LOCATION. AGAIN EACH MEMBER AS A DOWNTOWN OFFICE AND DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO IN ADDITION TO ONE A DISTRICT OFFICE AND THEIR- IN THEIR RESPECTIVE. DISTRICTS SO ARE ARE THEY DO THEY ARE THEY ALL PHYSICALLY IN THE SAME LOCATION. OR IN DIFFERENT BUILDINGS. THEY'RE IN THEIR SACS DOWN OFFICE THERE ARE TWO AND BUILDING. SHARING A BUILDING AND THE OTHER TWO WERE IN TWO DISTINCT BUILDING SO WE HAVE THREE SEPARATE LOCATIONS FOR THEM. AND DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO AND OF COURSE IN THEIR EQUALIZATION DISTRICTS THEY'RE EACH. A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT BASED ON GEOGRAPHY. AND ARE THESE THREE BUILDING STATE OWNED BUILDINGS OR ARE THEY PRIVATE BUILDINGS. I ONE OF THEM IS A STATE ON THE BILL AND SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE OF STATE OUT AND THE OTHER TWO- ARE OTHER THREE ARE PRIVATELY OWNED AND SACRAMENTO. SO ARE IN THE- DOCKET NO I'M ASKING. THE BUILDINGS LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO ARE THEY ALL. ARE THEY ARE ARE ANY OF THEM STATE BUILDINGS. OUR MEMBERS ARE LOCATED- HAVE THEIR OFFICES. NO SIR THEY ARE NOT. K. THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE WHERE. WE WERE THIS IS AT LEAST IN THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE RAISED THIS ISSUE ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS WHERE WE'VE ASKED WHETHER OR NOT- THE BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF OVERSEEING THE TAXPAYERS DOLLARS. YOU WOULD THINK WOULD BE A LOT MORE CAUTIOUS IN HOW THE EXPENDITURES DOLLARS AS WELL GIVEN ALSO SOME OF THE SKETCH YOUR PRACTICES OF SOME PREVIOUS PORT MEMBERS THAT I'VE HAD IN THIS IN IN ON THIS BOARD- AND SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT. MESSAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOUDLY HEARD THAT THEY WOULD OF- CONSOLIDATED THEIR OFFICES INTO A STATE BUILDING SO THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE AN ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE- BUT INSTEAD THEY'RE PAYING RENT OR OR LEASING SPACE I'M ASSUMING IT'S PROBABLY SOME KIND OF A LONG TERM LEASE AS WELL. IN THREE DIFFERENT SEPARATE BUILDINGS IN A CITY WHERE THERE ARE. ANYONE WANNA TAKE A GUESS HOW MANY STATE BUILDINGS THERE ARE. A LOT QUITE A FEW SPACES. AND SO I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY HASN'T THIS WHY HASN'T ANYONE BEEN CONSCIOUS WHY HAVEN'T ANY OF THE BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE VOTED BY THE PUBLIC BEEN CONSCIOUS ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT ACTUALLY EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT AND THEIR ABILITY OF MOVING CONSOLIDATING THEIR OFFICES INTO ONE BUILDING. AT LEAST MAYBE EVEN IF IT'S ONE PRIVATELY OWNED BUILDING NOT A STATE BUILDING AT LEAST MAYBE THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF- A NEGOTIATING POWERS AND BE ABLE TO LEAVE SOMETHING FOR- PROBABLY SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN WHAT THEY'RE PAYING NOW. IN THREE DIFFERENT STEP IN THREE SEPARATE BUILDINGS. WHY HASN'T THAT HAPPENED SO FAR. SO IF- IF I MAY OFFERS OR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CONSIDER. OUR LOOKING AT THIS OF THE LOCATIONS ARE JUST A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT LINES ONE WAS BAGLEY KEENE- AND SO ANY LOCATIONS THAT WE LOOK FOR FIRST OF ALL WE LOOK FOR THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE LET ME BEGIN THERE ACTUALLY. I WOULD LOOK FOR THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE BASED UPON WHAT THE PRIOR- FOOTPRINTS- TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE OFFICES BEFORE AND THE COST OF THOSE LEASES. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BOTH SIDES OF THE OFFICE AND THE AND THE LEAST COST I'M SORRY SIR I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME BUT WE NEGOTIATED THAT VERY CLOSELY WITH ALL DEPARTMENTS FINANCE AND DGS TO ENSURE THAT WE BECAUSE ALSO RELATED TO THE REDUCTION IN STAFF. WE ENSURE THAT WE WERE APPROACHING AS AS COST EFFECTIVELY AS WE COULD- WE DID CONSIDER- AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIND A LOCATION FOR ALL FOUR OF THE MEMBERS THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE WHAT THE OPTIONS WERE AVAILABLE AT THE TIME WE WERE DOING THIS THIS WORK. WE WERE LOOKING AT- THE LOOK OUT OF THE FACILITY FOR SECURITY REASONS BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RUN OUR NATION OF ANY BAGLEY KEENE. THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE YOU KNOW MEMBERS ABANDONING SHIP OTHER AND JUST CHATTING THINGS AND OR THEIR STAFF UNFORTUNATELY THE TIME WE WERE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS WHILE THEY WERE A LOT OF A LOT. OF STATE BUILDINGS AVAILABLE- I'M TRYING TO LOCATE THOSE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND SOMETHING THAT'S THAT FIT THE NEEDS FOR THE BOARD. THERE STEP. AND OTHER RACIAL NEEDS THERE WEREN'T IN THAT SUED SO OUR NEXT SIR WAS TO JUST TAKE IT BACK OF THE NECK BEST TO OPT WE DIDN'T SOME- SOME PRIVATE SECTOR LEASES BUT THERE ARE FOUR WAS SIR TO INSURE THAT WE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THEM THAT REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SO WE HAD FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE OFFICES. THE PRIOR BOARD. ONE MEMBER HAD THE ENTIRE PHYSICAL SPACE. THAT WILL OFFICE HAS BEEN SPLIT SO THAT TWO MEMBERS ARE OCCUPYING THAT SPACE YOU KNOW WITHOUT WITH SOME SOME MINOR CONSTRUCTION THAT WAS DONE ON IT. SO WE LOOK FOR EVERY EFFICIENCY WITH THE INTENT OF MAKING SURE THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS OF THE BOARD MEMBERS EXPRESSED THAT. FIND THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT EXCEEDING IT BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE JUST FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS WORKING THE LEGISLATURE REGULATE. THAT THEY HAVE CLOSE PROXIMITY ONTO THE CAPITOL OFFICES SO- WE TRY TO DO THAT ITCONSISTENT WITH ALSO SERVE FRANKLY WITH YOU HAVE MANY OF THE RECONCILE STAFF. THAT WERE LOCATED IN THE SACRAMENTO OFFICES WE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION ON ANY OTHER MOVES THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED THEM YOU KNOW WHAT HAD AN IMPACT FOR STAFFING SO WAS ALSO. I'M SOME THAT WAS SOME OF THE CONSIDERATION WHETHER DOWNTOWN STAFFING. SO WE LOOK FOR THE MOST. EFFECTIVE AND THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OUR- IN OUR LEASE COST AND PHYSICAL. WE ARE STILL PAYING RENT AT THE END OF THE DAY AND YOU'RE STILL LEASING FROM THREE DIFFERENT. UP PRIVATE ENTITIES INSTEAD OF BEING LOCATED AT COLOCATED IN THE STATE BUILDING- I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY FIRST OF ALL THE EVEN MOVED OUT OF- THE FOUR FIFTY BUILDING. WHEN THE REST OF THE STAFF REMAIN THERE- EVEN WHAT IF THERE WERE CHALLENGES WITH THE BUILDING. WHY WOULD THE LEADERSHIP LEAVE BUT THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE STAFF STAY BEHIND IN THE BUILDING IF THERE INDEED ARE CHALLENGES WITH THE- WITH THE BUILDING. AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS COMBUSTIBLE FRACTURING AND THE WINDOWS WERE SHATTERING NONE OF THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL WINDOWS SHATTERED IT WAS- EMPLOYEE LEVEL WINDOWS THAT WERE SHATTERED. CARE TO COMMENT ON THAT. WHAT WHAT I THINK- IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE TIME WE WERE HAVING THE BUILDING ISSUES IT WASN'T JUST THE BOARD MEMBERS THAT MOVED OUT- THAT TO INCLUDED A NUMBER OF STAFF THAT MOVED OUT BECAUSE WE HAD NOT JUST THE- BUILDING ISSUES WITH GLASS BUT THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE KNOWN THAT- THAT MOLD ECCENTRIC SATCHER. SO THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT DID MOVE OUT TO. A RITE AID LOCATIONS- I REMEMBER SITTING IN A NUMBER OF MEETINGS AT THE TIME WHEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT THE BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE BILLION WEEKEND AND CHALLENGED- SOME OF THE I MEAN IT'S JUST SMALL THINGS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU HAD TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING BASED UPON THE AGE OF THE OF THE- THE ELEVATORS FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS ON THERE WAS ONLY SO MUCH TRAFFIC GOING UP AND DOWN ELEVATORS THOSE ARE SMALL THINGS THAT SEEM INSIGNIFICANT BUT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH PERSONNEL AND BUILDING ISSUES THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE ITEMS ON THE TABLE SO IT WASN'T JUST THE BOARD MEMBERS THAT MOVED OUT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT- OTHERS THAT THAT MOVED OUT- IN FACT THE BOARD MEMBERS WERE MOVED OUT. TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE MORE OF THE STAFF THAT NEEDED TO BE PHYSICALLY IN THE BUILDING STYLE- TOO MUCH BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS THE BOARD'S GONNA WISH TO MOVE OUT I THINK IT WAS JUST PART OF THE DISCUSSION TO FREE UP SOME SPACE. MISS ONE I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE REST I WAS TOURING THAT BY TOWARD THAT BUILDING ON A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT OCCASIONS AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE AND FROM WHAT I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY DISTINCTLY A LOT OF THE STAFF WERE STILL IN THE BUILDING AND NOT HADN'T MOVED- BUT BUT- YOU ALSO MENTIONED ABOUT BAGLEY KEENE. IF PORT FOR THE VIEWING AUDIENCE I'D LIKE YOU TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS. SO THAT UP SO THAT I CAN GET TO MY QUESTION. SO IN JUST IN GENERAL HOW. SOME I BASICALLY. IS THE- BILL STATUTE OF ROLLS AROUND PUBLIC MEETINGS. AND THE ISSUE AS RELATES TO BOARD MEMBERS IS THAT WHEN I'M BORED MEMBERS COME TOGETHER AS A LECTOR BODIES- THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY DISCUSSIONS OR DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE- THAT WHICH- BE A PART OF THEIR- OF THEIR AUTHORITY. THOSE CONVERSATIONS DECISIONS AND ACTIONS THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AND BE EXPOSED TO THAT. SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO UNDER THE BACK WE CAN ROLL BACK WE CAN ACT IS TO MAKE SURE. THAT BOARD MEMBERS HAVE SOME DEGREE OF SEPARATION UNTIL THEY'RE IN THE PUBLIC MEETINGS. AND SO WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER IN A PUBLIC MEETINGS AND ITEMS ARE PUT THE AGENDAS ARE PUBLISHED THE PUBLIC IS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE. I HAVE FULL ACCESS TO ANY OF THE ACTIONS ARE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING. THE CONCERN IS THAT IF YOU HAVE THEM AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE YOU KNOW TO. TAKE CAUTION WITH BEFORE WHEN THEY'RE ALL CALL LOCATED IN A BUILDING. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED BY LEGAL IT'S JUST THE SENSITIVITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT CO MINGLING SOMEPLACE. AND POTENTIALLY HAVING A CONVERSATION THAT SOME COULD CONSIDER IS LIKE HEY OUR HIGHLANDER THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE NOT. HAVING AN EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION OR DISCUSSING SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE PUBLICLY. TO USE. THAT THIS FUNDING DO YOU HAVE THAT LEGAL DOCUMENT. I HAVE IT IN FRONT HAVE THAT OPINION AVAILABLE- I COULD WORK WITH AFTER TO RETRIEVE INFORMATION I WANT TO SEE THE ORIGINAL ONE NOT NOTHING NEW I WANT TO SEE THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN I THINK. I I'M WONDERING IF WE'RE BREAKING ANY LAWS BY HAVING EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IN THE SAME BUILDING. I CAN TAKE A LOOK WHAT'S THERE SO MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE BOARD AS I SAY HAS BEEN QUITE AWHILE SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN. SOME OF THOSE- HERE BUT I'LL CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO GO BACK AND WORK WITH LEGAL SEE WHAT WE COULD RETREAT FOR YOU. IS A PART OF HISTORIC MATERIAL. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT BASED ON SOME A LEGAL OPINION THAT THEY DECIDED TO CHOOSE TO GO TO DIFFERENT BUILDINGS. I'LL GO BACK AND GET THE INFORMATION FOR YOU SO. BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THIS FLIES AGAINST THE FACE OF EVERY LOCAL JURISDICTION L. A. CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SHOULD AND ALL ALL FIFTEEN SHOULDN'T BE LOCATED IN THE SAME BUILDING THEY EVEN HAVE. MORE RESTRICTIVE MEASURES OF HOW NOT TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER- IT APPLIES TO EVERY SINGLE JURISDICTION BELW THE STATE LEVEL. AS WELL AS TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AS WELL SO I'M I'M JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION- HAS SUCH A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE. TO HAVE SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITSELF. AND THE REST OF US DON'T. SO CARE TO COMMENT ON THAT. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS ARE AYE AYE. I CAN GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE MATERIAL THAT WAS PROVIDED ORIGINALLY AND SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU- AGAIN SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY YOU KNOW. WITHOUT GOING INTO A DEEP DIVE DISCUSSION ON BACK WE CAN PURCHASE THE BROWN ACT WHICH GOVERNS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE LEGISLATURE DIFFERENT BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT SOME SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT APPLICATION OF THOSE RULES. ARE SO HARD TO STAND THAT AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU TO EXPLAIN IT SO THAT EVERYONE HEARS THAT NO I GET THAT BUT I DON'T THINK THE CHANGES ARE- WIDELY DIFFERENT BETWEEN. US AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY AND- AND THE BODY THAT YOU REPRESENT YOU YOUR REPRESENTING RIGHT NOW THAT THAT REQUIRES A THEM TO BE IN A DIFFERENT BUILDING- I'LL I'LL LET THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS- I CAN GO ON FOR SOME MORE BUT- AT THIS POINT I'LL JUST TAKE A- TAKE A BREAK AND I APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU'RE NOT THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE IN THE LINE OF FIRE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN OTHER COMMENTS FROM DIETS. ARE THINKING WE WANT TO.

MARIN SECTIONS ARE HONEST THE DATE AND WE'VE SEEN BASICALLY TWO LEGS OF ISSUES THE FIRST IS AROUND OWNERSHIP.

ON THE SECOND LIKE IT'S AROUND RECORDS- THERE'S A LACK OF BANKING RECORDS I BY MANY CANNABIS BUSINESSES- AND ALSO IN GENERAL AVOIDANCE TO FORMAL RECORD KEEPING. IN TERMS OF THE BENEFIT OF THIS REQUEST- IT WOULD ENHANCE OUR ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES- WHICH SHOULD REDUCE OVERALL NON COMPLIANCE- AND IN ADDITION GENERATED OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS.

WHO WERE IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM AT ANY TIME AGE THIRTEEN OR OLDER- THIS CREDIT IS MODELED AFTER THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND PROVIDES A FLAT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FAMILIES THAT OTHERWISE. QUALIFY FOR THE EITC AND HAVE A CHILD AGE FIVE OR UNDER. SIMILARLY THIS NEW CREDIT WILL ALSO PROVIDE A FLAT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO YOUNG ADULTS THAT OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE EITC THIS CREDIT IS INDEXED TO INFLATION AND WILL PHASE OUT THE SAME AS THE CURRENT YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. FOSTER YOUTH AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE THAT ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND TRIBAL YOUTH THAT ARE UNDER THE STATE'S JURISDICTION WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT. ADULTS THAT ARE RAISED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM GENERALLY SUFFER THAT WERE RAISED IN THE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM GENERALLY SUFFER DISPROPORTIONATE LEVELS OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AND POVERTY. A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR RANGE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION. TRANSITION IN THE WORK FORCE THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS MEANINGFUL CREDIT- THE CREDIT ALSO ENCOURAGES TAX FILING WHICH IS A KEY PART OF BUILDING GENERAL ECONOMIC LITERACY. AND COULD LEAD TO THE CLAIMING OF OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AND BENEFITS AMONG THIS POPULATION. OF THE CREDIT WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND RICK REQUIRED DATA SHARING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AS THE ESTIMATE IS THAT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS COULD POTENTIALLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT. AND THEN AFTER COUNTING FOR TYPICAL TAKE UP RATES AS WELL AS THE INCOME REQUIREMENTS OF THE COUNTY ITC. THE FISCAL COST OF THIS PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT TWENTY MILLION PER YEAR. AND AFFECT ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. WITH THEIR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CONTINUE ON WITH THE- THE OTHER ISSUES IN THIS- ISSUERS ARE STOP THERE. LET'S CONTINUE ON WITH THE OTHER ISSUES PLEASE. OKAY SO THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT- IS WAS CREATED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET TO HELP NICK NICK CHEUNG YOUNG CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY THIS CREDIT IN MOST CASES OFFERS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD THAT QUALIFIES FOR THE CARRIER TO SEE THAT HAS A CHILD AGE FIVE OR YOUNGER THE CURRENT OF THE YOUNG YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT CURRENTLY REQUIRES RECIPIENTS TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE DOLLAR OF EARNED INCOME EARNED INCOME IS INCOME FROM ALL EMPLOYMENT INCLUDING WAGES SALARIES TIPS AND OTHER COMPENSATION. SELF EMPLOYMENT INCOME IS CONSIDERED EARNED INCOME FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEAR FOR ABOUT FOUR TWENTY THOUSAND TAXPAYERS CLAIM THIS CREDIT. SO THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL BEGINNING ITH TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT REMOVES A ONE DOLLAR REQUIREMENT ALLOWS ALLOWS HOUSEHOLDS WITH NO EARNED INCOME OR NEGATIVE EARNED INCOME TO CLAIM THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. IF THEY OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE COUNTY ITC- THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT IS DESIGNED TO ALLEVIATE CHILD POVERTY RATHER THAN AS AN INCENTIVE TO WORK AND THEREFORE IT MAKES POLICY STEP. AND STICKS THEM THIS BENEFIT FAMILIES WITH NO INCOME TO ALLEVIATE CHILD POVERTY. REQUIRING ARNIE'S EARNINGS EXCLUDES PARENTS WHOSE NEED TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD PREVENTS THEM FROM MEETING MAINTAINING A JOB. AS WELL AS THOSE THAT CANNOT FIND CHILD CARE TO MAINTAIN A JOB. FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN HAT HAVE NO INCOME ARE JUST AS DESERVING TO RECEIVE THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT IS FAMILIES WITH INCOME. THIS EXPANSION OF THE YOUNG REDUCE GENERAL FUND REVENUES BY FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR BEGINNING IN FISCAL TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AFFECT ABOUT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IN THE INDEXES THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT FOR INFLATION. STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TAX YEAR TO PREVENT INFLATION FROM ERODING THE VALUE OF THIS IMPORTANT TAX CREDIT. FOR FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. THIS CHANGE WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE HAVE A STATE AND FEDERAL. EITC WHICH ARE BOTH INDEXED TO INFLATION WOULD BE ADMINISTERED. AS MENTIONED OVER FOUR THOUSAND FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS CHANGE AND THIS PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE PERSONAL INCOME TAX REVENUES BY NINETEEN MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS AND IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS AS THE INFLATION IS ADJUSTED- ARE LASTLY WE HAVE THE- WE HAVE A TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET THAT'S INCLUDED FOR OUT REACH SO WITH THAT THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND THEN ADD I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES WELL AS FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT LET'S GO TO THE ALLEY- PLEASE. WEATHERFORD RAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS REGARDING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND CHILD TAX CREDIT PROPOSALS. BUT WE'RE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON AN ANALYTICAL REQUEST MY HAPPENED. THANK YOU LET'S HEAR FROM FTP PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON. SO I MEAN TO SAY THAT BEING TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE CREDIT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS THAT IS ABLE AND WILLING TO ASSIST. NUMBER SEVEN FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. INTIAL OFFICER FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. SO IN REGARD TO THESE TWO CREDITS- AGAIN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THAT CAN BE IS ONLINE THAT CAN ASSIST BUT I'M GONNA TRY TO STOP IT- ADDRESSING THE OUTRAGE TYPE ORIENTED QUESTIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA SO- AS YOU KNOW- AND OTHERS KNOW IT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FOR ABOUT THE LAST YEAR PRETTY HEAVILY AND REGARDS TO HOW CAN WE ENHANCE OUTREACH HOW CAN WE-MAKE IT EASIER TO FILE- JANUARY THIRD WE ISSUED A REPORT THAT MANY FOLKS HAVE CONTINUED TO READ THROUGHOUT THE MONTHS FOLLOWING. IN REGARDS TO MANY- INCENTIVES AND- EFFORTS THAT WE COULD DO TO DO THAT- MANY OF THOSE EFFORTS ARE ALSO RELEVANT TO REACHING OUT TO FOSTER YOUTHS WERE REACHING OUT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO NOT HAVE ZERO INCOME BUT WHAT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ELIGIBLE THOSE CREDITS. SO- FOSTER YOU THE WE ARE STILL WORKING ON SCHOOL. WITH OUR PARTNER AGENCIES TO THE US US ON HOW WE CAN OPERATIONALIZE THIS. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE OUTREACH UNDER OUR FEDERAL LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THE DISCLOSURE OF THE NAMES OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. SO I HAVE TO BE CERTAIN I COULD NOT DO DIRECT OUTREACH TO THESE INDIVIDUALS AND WE ARE SEEING WHAT CBS ASKING GENERAL. HOWEVER THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S A LOT OF ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT WORK WITH THESE INDIVDUALS AND WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE LEVERAGING THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HELPING US- ADVOCATE THAT THESE PROPOSALS. EXISTS TO BEACH COSTS ARE YOU. ON AND THAT HOW THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT SO- THAT IS DEFINITELY A KEY STRATEGY THAT WILL BE DURING THIS YEAR. LONDON STRENGTHENING FOUR ZERO INCOME INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE ELIGIBLE POTENTIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE SMALLER TO BE INDUCTED. I'M FOR THE MOST PART THOSE ARE INVISIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE TO BE ON BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE INCOME STREAM. THAT COMES INTO A SUCH AS WAGES WHICH IS THE MOST- CREDIBLE WAY THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER NOT TO BE I'M SITTING AND WAITING AROUND FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN MORE ALSO REACHING OUT. TO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO SEE IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND SOME OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THIS GROUP. AND THEN ONE OF US FROM THOSE RESPECTIVE THREE AGENCIES REACHING OUT TO THOSE FOLKS AT THAT POINT AS WELL. AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE CUT ITS EXISTENCE- MAKE SURE THERE WERE FEDERAL CREDIT I THINK IT ALSO QUITE FOR. AND THEN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF HOW TO ENGAGE THREE TAX PREPARATION SERVICE. VITA IN THE EVENT THAT THE SERVICES. RUNNING OUT. HERE REACHED OUT TO. SO I'M WITH I DON'T HAVE ANSWER OTHER SPECIFIC QUESTION YOU LET OUT. IN ALL- ON BACKSHEET THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MUCH OF. LET'S GO TO WITNESS HERE IN THE ROOM. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALYSSA ANDERSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PROPOSING TO AND EARNINGS REQUIREMENT FOR CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. THIS WILL HELP MORE FAMILIES WHO ARE WORKING HARD TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN MEET BASIC NEEDS AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL NOW THAT THESE FAMILIES WILL BE DENIED THE FEDERAL CHILD TAX CREDIT. BUT INCLUDING THESE FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA'S CREDIT IS JUST THE FIRST STEP. THE NEXT STEP IS MAKING SURE THOSE FAMILIES ACTUALLY GET THE CREDIT. THE CHALLENGES THESE FAMILIES ARE REQUIRED TO FILE TAXES. SO WHAT'S NEEDED TO HELP FAMILIES GET THE CREDIT. FIRST MORE FUNDING AND CONSISTENT FUNDING TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FREE TAX PREP SITES BECAUSE IT'S CRITICAL THAT FAMILIES LEARN ABOUT THE CREDIT THROUGH TRUSTED MESSENGERS. WHO CAN HELP THEM CLAIM THE CREDIT FOR FREE. MORE FREE TAX PREP MEANS MORE MONEY INTO FAMILIES POCKETS AND MORE OF WHAT CALIFORNIA SPENT ON TAX CREDITS GOING TO FAMILIES INSTEAD OF FOR PROFIT TAX PREPARERS. A SECOND WAY CALIFORNIA CAN HELP FAMILIES GET THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT IS BY MAKING A SIMPLE CHANGE IN STATUTE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC FAMILIES ENROLLED IN SAFETY NET PROGRAMS WHO ARE AT RISK OF MISSING OUT ON THE CREDIT BECAUSE THEY DON'T FILE TAXES. THEN THE DEPARTMENTS COULD CONNECT THESE FAMILIES WITH FREE FILING RESOURCES. THIS COULD REACH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. DSS RECENTLY CONDUCTED A SIMILAR EFFORT AROUND FEDERAL STIMULUS PAYMENTS THAT'S BEING EVALUATED BY THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB IN THE PEOPLE LAB TO SEE WHICH OUTREACH STRATEGIES ARE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND THAT COULD INFORM HOW BEST TO REACH FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. ANOTHER IDEA FROM CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB IS FOR COUNTIES TO HELP DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR CLIENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT WHENEVER THEY RECERTIFY ELIGIBILITY FOR A PROGRAM. THAT MAKE APPOINTMENTS FOR THEM AT FREE TAX PREP SITES. THIS IS A BEST PRACTICE THAT WOULD DIRECTLY CONNECT FAMILIES FROM ONE SOURCE OF SUPPORT TO ANOTHER. IN THE CREDIT. FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE FAMILIES WITHOUT EARNINGS COULD CLAIM THE CREDIT WITHOUT FIRST HAVING TO COMPLETE A FEDERAL RETURN. THAT WOULD EASE THE BURDEN FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE NO REASON TO FILE A FEDERAL TURN NOW THAT THEY ARE SHOT OUT OF THE FEDERAL CHILD TAX CREDIT. OR MAYBE HAVE TO BE COULD PROVIDE A SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR FAMILIES WITHOUT EARNINGS TO CLAIM THE CREDIT SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THROUGH THE QUESTIONS ON A FULL STATE RETURN THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THEM. THESE ARE JUST SOME IDEAS AND AS WE HEARD EARLIER FTP HAS OTHERS AS WELL. AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT IN LOOKING AT HOW TO GET THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. TO FAMILIES WITHOUT EARNINGS. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TACKLE A MUCH BROADER CHALLENGE. OF HOW TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC RELIEF THAT REACHES PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE EARNINGS. AND ARE AMONG THOSE MOST IN NEED OF SUPPORT RIGHT NOW. FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN PROVIDING- CALIFORNIANS ECONOMIC RELIEF IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND PEOPLE WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES ARE MOST IN NEED. SIX IN TEN CALIFORNIANS WITH INCOMES UNDER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. REPORTED STRUGGLING TO PAY BASIC EXPENSES LAST MONTH. THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST. THE GAS BUT RISING FOOD AND RENT AT A TIME WHEN MOST PANDEMIC EIGHT HAS ENDED. SO IT'S CONVERSATIONS AROUND PROVIDING RELIEF CONTINUE IT'S WORTH REFLECTING ON HOW CALIFORNIA ACHIEVED A REALLY INCREDIBLE FEET LAST YEAR. GETTING RELIEF OUT TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THROUGH THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS AND PARTICULARLY TARGETING MILLIONS OF KALYA TO SEE RECIPIENTS. THAT WAS PAIRED WITH GOLDEN STATE GRANTS THAT REACHED MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE EARNINGS AND WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THE STIMULUS TO FTP. THESE ARE PROVEN WAYS TO TARGET RELIEF TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST. AND THEY COULD BE USED% AGAIN THIS YEAR. AND PERHAPS EVEN BE EXPANDED TO REACH MORE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITHOUT EARNINGS. SO I THINK THESE ARE QUESTIONS WORTH EXPLORING SO THAT YOU CAN FURTHER DEVELOP EFFECTIVE WAYS OF TARGETING MEANINGFUL RELIEF TO AS MANY CALIFORNIANS IN NEED AS POSSIBLE. NOT JUST IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BUT IN FUTURE YEARS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANA HOW SUPPLIED WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA AND REPRESENTING THE CAL THE ATC COALITION. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE INCLUSION OF TEN MILLION IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR KELLY A TO SEE OUT REGION FREE TAX PREP GRANTS. HOWEVER WE STRONGLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO INVEST THIRTY MILLION AN HOUR EACH AND VITA. ONLY ONE IN ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS WHO RECEIVED THE CAL THE ITC IN TAX YOUR TWENTY TWENTY USED A FREE SERVICE TO FILE THEIR TAXES. THAT MEANS NINETY NINE OUT OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED YOU'D USED A PAID-SERVICE WHEN THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE SERVICES SUCH AS VITA. MY FREE TAXES .ORG CALIFORNIA LIKE CETERA. THE MAJORITY OF THESE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WENT TO A PAID PREPARER COSTING THEM SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH. IF ONLY 1% OF THE OVER THREE MILLION CALLIE ATC ELIGIBLE TAX FILERS USED A FREE FILE OPTION. WE NEED TO FACE THE REALITY THAT COLLECTIVELY THE MAJORITY. ARE PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO AND POTENTIALLY MISSING OUT ON THE BENEFITS OF THE TAX CREDITS THEMSELVES. SO WE HAVE TO ASK WHERE IS THE DISCONNECT WE HAVE ROBUST AND GROWING TAX CREDITS AND FREE OPTIONS FROM IRS CERTIFIED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THE DISCONNECT IS AND HOW MUCH WE SUPPORT CBO'S THE GET THE WORD OUT AND PROVIDE FREE TAX PREP. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS NOT LIGHT WORK IT IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN TRUST RELATIONSHIPS AND CONTINUING TO SHOW UP. IN THE STATE OF NEARLY FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THERE WERE ONLY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN CBO SAID OPERATED THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE OUR REGION VITA SITES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE CANNOT EXPECT THIS LIMITED NUMBER OF CBO'S WHICH ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED TO FUNCTION ONLY SEVEN MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR WITH VOLUNTEERS TO SERVE MILLIONS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS SUCCESSFULLY. BUT WE CANSET GOALS FOR GROWTH IF THERE IS FUNDING IN GOALS FOR GROWTH WILL BE NEEDED AS A VITAL SERVICES REACH FULL CAPACITY EVERY YEAR. ENTER CORREOS DISTRICT THROUGH TEN DIFFERENT VITA SITES 500-080-0409 TOTAL RETURNS WERE FILED FOR FREE IN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. BRINGING OVER NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS DISTRICT BY TO SITES COMPLETED ROUGHLY TWELVE HUNDRED RETURNS TOTALING TWO POINT TWO MILLION IN TAX CREDITS. TOTAL SAVINGS AND TAX PREP FEES WERE NEARLY. THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A SINGLE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. VITAL WORKS BUT WE MUST GROW TO MEET DEMAND. AND OUR REGION WIDE SPREAD AVAILABILITY IS WHAT COMMERCIAL PREPARERS USED TO CORNER THE MARKET ON PAID TAX PREP. INTO IT SPENT TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALONE ON SELLING AND MARKETING. THIS IS JUST ONE COMPANY WITH A FIFTH OF THE TOTAL. PAID TAX PREP MARKET. ADVOCATES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE STATE SPEND THAT KIND OF MONEY IT DOESN'T PRESENT THEMSELVES L. IT JUSTIFICATION FOR STEPPING UP OUR PRECEDENTS. FROM THIS YEAR'S THIS CURRENT BUDGET YEAR OF FIFTEEN MILLION OVER SEVEN MONTHS TO. AGAIN FOR A FULL TWELVE IN A- WAY. WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WITH YOUR OVER YOUR BASELINE INVESTMENTS WE COULD GREATLY EXPAND OUR SERVICES AND CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT WAYS. AND SET ROBUST TARGETS AND BENCHMARKS FOR INCREASED FREE FILING. AS A NEW OR EXPANDED TAX CREDITS ARE ESTABLISHED LIKE THE FOSTER YOUTH TAX CREDIT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHILD TAX CREDIT PAYMENT WE WOULD HAVE A NETWORK OF PARTNERS TO RELY ON TO TARGET MESSAGING AND SERVICES. I WILL END BY SHARING THE WORDS OF SOME RAM NIAGARA WHO FILED HIS TAXES VIA VITA PROVIDED BY UNITED WAY'S FRESNO MADERA COUNTY'S. HE SHARED. RIGHT IT IS A FANTASTIC RESOURCE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS FOR SOMETHING AS DIFFICULT AS TAXES IT SHOULD BE A SERVICE OFFERED TO EVERYONE AND DESERVED MORE FUNDING. THE PEOPLE INVITED MAKE THE PROCESS LOOKS SIMPLE WHICH IS HOW IT SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE TAXES ARE HARD INVITED MAKES IT EASY. PEOPLE SHOULD USE VITA SO THEY'RE NOT WASTING THEIR TIME AND MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE SIMPLIFIED. INVITA HELPS WITH THAT. SO WE ASK YOU TO FUND OUR REGION BITE AND THANK YOU. VERY MUCH MUCH MUCH APPRECIATE- THE ISSUE THAT IS BEING BROUGHT UP NOW. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I WANT TO- GET SOME ANSWERS TO SPECIFICALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HAS THE NEED FOR E. I. T. C. Y. C. T. C. VITA PROGRAMS DECREASED SINCE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YEAH THAT WOULD THAT TO FOR MY COLLEAGUE- KRISTALLNACHT ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT THE NEED FOR THE FINANCING CREASED. IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR THE PROGRAM- I THINK THAT DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS- TURN TO THE INCOME NEEDS OF THE RECIPIENTS- IN TERMS OF HELP REACH- I THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ON THE PROPOSED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND PROPOSING ANOTHER TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO CONTINUE OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS FOR THE I. T.'S. YOUNG TECH. MAKE HELLO PERCEPTS OR AWARE OF THE STAR TO APPLY FOR. A MENTOR OF THIS. STATUS OF THE RECIPIENT AND THE RECIPIENTS THE POOL ELIGIBLE PERSONS WHO ARE- WHO CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE- OF THESE PROGRAMS I WOULD I WOULD DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES IN OUR FORECASTING UNIT. SO THIS IS JEANETTE HERRON I CAN SOME INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO NOT. SHOW I THINK IT'S BEEN SEVERAL YEARS NOW SINCE WE HAVE BEEN AND USING CASH INTO THE VITA SITES. ONE THING THAT WE SAW ON THE FLOOR TODAY BECAUSE CAPITA DESTROYED THAT'S ON STOP PUBLIC IS NOT WILDLIFE AND ENOUGH TO SELL. DID NOT APPEAR TO BE GROWING THANK YOU HAD TO SEE RETURNS WITH ANOTHER UNIVERSE MORE GROWING AND SO THE OUTRAGE DOLLARS WE'RE GETTING- TO WHERE WE NEEDED THEM TO GO TO GET MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE CLAIMING THE KELLY AGENCY TO PROPS MIGRATE. TO THE FREE FUNDING SERVICE OR FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE A CHANCE RETURN I'M BUT AGAIN WITH CHILDREN WHICH TOOK MANY OF THAT IN PERSON SITES OFFLINE. LEAVING LITTLE SUPPORT OR ONLINE SUPPORT WHICH NOT EVERYONE IS COMFORTABLE WITH THE STATISTICS HAVE NOT YET RECOVERED OR I GUESS I SHOULD SAY THE ACTIVITY ITSELF HAS NOT YET RECOVERED. IN REGARDS TO- PUTTING VITA AT THE FOREFRONT TO ON TRACK TO COVER THE SCOTT. SO THAT BEING SAID WE STILL DO YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A LARGE TRANSITORY POPULATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CREDIT- HISTORICALLY CLOSE PRE COATED WE SAW ABOUT 40% OF INDIVIDUALS CLAIM THE CREDIT YEAR OVER YEAR WHICH MEANT ABOUT 60% OF FILERS YEAR OVER YEAR WERE NEW FINE ARTS. ON SO WITH COPELAND WE SAW THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY ANALYZE OBJECT FIFTY FIFTY- RANGE OR 50% OF THE INDIVIDUALS CLAIMED AT THE AIRPORT AND FIFTY PERCENT- WERE NEEDED I AM EXPERT TIME DURING THE COULD YEARS SO UNCLEAR WHERE THAT TRIMBLE SUCH BUT- THAT DOES SUGGEST. AGAIN I NEED THAT THERE IS SOME EDUCATION THAT IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY TO DO YEAR OVER YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FOLKS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. FOR THIS CREDIT ARM BOX HEARING ABOUT IT. I WILL SAY THAT THE WHITE IF OF THESE AND YOU ELECTRONIC FILING METHOD OPEN. SIX PER DO YOU. NOT GET ME THAT THEY'RE EITHER USING PREPARE AS BEST ALSO WHAT IS MENTIONED OR THAT THEY ARE- DOING THAT DOES. USING ON MY STUFF TOOLS. SO HAVE THEM FROM THAT SHOULD RAPID FIVE PER OF. TYPICALLY FILED WITH THE PREPARE THAT IS VERY VERY HIGH- BUT NOT INCONSISTENT WITH GENERAL POPULATION. BUT PERHAPS BEING ABLE TO AFFORD IT MORE SO AT THE GENERAL POPULATION UP LEVEL TWO FOR THOSE FEES VERSUS THE INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE CLAIMING THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT CREDIT ON THE COUNT YET YOU SEE AN YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. SHOW THE ONE THING THAT WE HAVE HEARD FOR DECADES IN REGARDS TO WHAT MAKES FIGHT AND NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL. IS LOCATION. AND I KNOW THAT THE OTHER KIDS IN THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY VERY HARD WITH THESE GRANT FUNDING TO SET UP NEW LOCATIONS AND OR TO EXPAND HOURS WHICH HAS PROVED EFFECTIVE- BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE VOLUNTEERS ARE FOLLOWING. WHICH MEANS THAT SERVICES COULD IMPACT COMPROMISED SO MANY ARMS REQUESTED ADVOCATES IN THE SENATE BILL FOURTEEN ONLINE REPORT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER SECTIONS G. AND H. PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO BENEFITS AND RESCUE IT'S YOUR ROUND FUNDING OR INCREASED FUNDING. ON SHOULD BE PROVIDED THAT MIGHT ASSIST IN ASSISTING THOSE THAT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OR THE EXPANSION OF. FREE TAX FILING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS HERMAN AND A NEED A LITTLE BIT OF CLEAR FOR TO YOU STATED SO BEFORE COVE IT DID I HEAR YOU CORRECTLY YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU SAW AN pFOR- EITC. SO MY COMMENTS- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO MY COMMENTS WERE IN REGARDS TO RELIEVE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT CLAIM THE CURRENT YEAR OVER YEAR. OFTEN TIMES WHEN A TAX CREDIT IS IMPLEMENTED IT IS PRESUMED THAT IT'S GOING TO BE RELEVANT YEAR OVER YEAR. AND SO ONCE YOU KNOW ABOUT IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT AGAIN BECAUSE YOU JUST AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO CRIMINAL YEAR'S RETURN YOU HAVE A CARRYOVER. CAL YET YOU SEE IS UNIQUE IN THAT WAY AND THAT IT REALLY IS FOCUSED AGAIN ON LOWER. THANKS THEN THE INCOME CHANNELS CHARM OR EXTREMELY IS CAN BE VERY TRANSITORY UP AND DOWN THE SCALE OF INCOME THAT MAKES AN ELIGIBLE ONE YEAR AND NOT ELIGIBLE THE NEXT. AND SO THAT IS THE REFERENCE POINT THAT I MADE EARLIER BEFORE KELVIN- EVEN IN SPITE OF THE GROWTH EVERY YEAR OF THE EXPANSION IS PROBABLY THE BETTER WORD TO SAY IN THE KALYANJI SIGNATURE. WE SAW ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE 40% OF THE FACTS CLAIMING THAT WERE REPETITIVE CLAIMS YEAR OVER YEAR. AND THEREFORE 60% WORK. I'M SORRY THE- THOSE OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE WILL WANT TO SURE KNOW ABOUT IT AND SOME SHAPE FORM SO THAT THEY DON'T ON THEIR NOT AWARE THEY DON'T ACTION OTHERWISE. SO WE OPEN WHAT WE SAW AND MY LIKELY A RESULT OF THE- CONTINUING CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES AND WE SAW MORE PEOPLE CLAIM THAT YOU'RE OVER HERE THAT- 40% HISTORICALLY WHEN UP TO ABOUT 50% A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 50% SO THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME MORE PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT YEAR OVER YEAR. UNLESS PEOPLE WERE NEW TO THE PROGRAM HOWEVER THERE STILL IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF JOBS THAT ARE NEEDED EACH YEAR- THAT HAVEN'T CLEANED IN THE PAST AND THOSE ARE THE ONES BELIEVE THAT THE OUTRAGE PER SE. IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN REGARDS TO. THANK YOU FOR THAT- FOR THAT ELABORATE OR IF THE DEPARTMENT OF- FINANCE CAN ELABORATE THE BUDGET PROPOSES TEN MILLION FOR OUT REACH WHAT WAS THE OUT REACH DOLLARS FOR PREVIOUS YEARS. THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET- FOR OUT REACHES A LEVEL OF ARTS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS- AGAIN WE ARE PROPOSING TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THAT'S NOT A REFLECTION ON THE SEA OF OUTREACH- PER SE IT'S- JUST ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR OUR REGION THE TOTALITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION SPENDING PROPOSAL. SO I GUESS I NEED A LITTLE BIT OF CLARITY BECAUSE OF. NUMBERS THAT WE SAW THAT REFLECTS A REDUCTION TO TEN MILLION TO FIFTEEN MILLION IS THAT ACCURATE. YES THAT IS CORRECT- WE ARE CLOSING TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT A REFLECTION. ON THE ADMINISTRATOR CAN VIEWS ON OUTREACH- IT'S JUST THE AMOUNT OF. MONEY THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR OUTRAGE SPENDING WITH THE AND THE FRAMEWORK THE- ADMINISTRATION'S OVERALL SPENDING PLAN FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WELL IF THE BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AND WE HAD ALREADY ALLOCATED FIFTEEN MILLION AND YOU'RE COMING BACK WITH TEN MILLION A REDUCTION OF FIVE MILLION. THAT TELLS ME THAT ARE REACHING TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE SUPPORT. ISN'T A PRIORITY. SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ARE ENCODED RECOVERY AND INCOME INEQUALITY IS A PRIORITY TO THE LEGISLATURE. WIDE WHY MAKE A WRITTEN A REDUCTION. OR A REDUCTION IN TO SAY A FIVE MILLION TO HELP LOW INCOME FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. DID MANAGE. AND YOU YOU HAVE BY IF YOU CUT OFF AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR RESPOND AGAIN OVER. CERTAINLY EACH CARRIED ON IT BUDGETS HAS PROVIDED FUNDING FOR EACH AND AGAIN THAT CHRISTIANS PROPOSED A CONDITIONAL AND ROUTE REACHING THE BUDGET YOU'RE AND AGAIN THE AMOUNT THAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS NOT A REFLECTION THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION A REFLECTION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEWS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUTREACH IT IS JUST ON THE AMOUNT AGAIN THAT WAS AVAILABLE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE OVERALL SPENDING PLAN. WELL SHE I'M TRYING TO TALK WHAT IF I COULD JUST INSERT CLARIFICATION POINT FIVE MILLION ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION LAST YEAR WAS FOR RICH RELATED TO GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROGRAMS. ON AND FINANCES THAT ALMOST COMPENSATION. APOLOGIES WERE HAVING SOME SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES SO I COULDN'T REALLY QUITE HEAR THE RESPONSE FROM MISTER WHITE OR THE CONNECTION WITH YOUR COMMENT NECESSARY MEANT. CAN YOU CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT ONCE AGAIN. I'D BE HAPPY TO TRY AGAIN HOPE WILL COME THROUGH MORE CLEARLY THIS TIME AGAIN THE- FIRST IS- JEANNIE POINTED OUT. THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET HAS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUTREACH OF WHICH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR. WELL ROUNDED IS NO LONGER GOING TO BE OFFERED OF IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO WE'RE PROPOSING TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING- IN THE BUDGET YEAR. FOR ON GOING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WHICH IS THE SAME AS WAS PROPOSED FOR ONGOING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION I APPRECIATED WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY. AMID ECONOMIC COVERT ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLEASE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE HELPING. LOW INCOME FAMILIES- THAT OBVIOUSLY NEED THE SUPPORT- AS WE EXPAND- EFFORTS FOR CALLIE I T. C. AS WELL AS FOSTER YOUTH WITH JUST CREDIBLE IMPORTANT. AND HONEST FOR THE RIGHT. I AM A- OF THE CONCEPT OF EXPANDING CAL ATC IN FOSTER YOUTH THAT THANK YOU FOR THE- THE DATA RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO MY DISTRICT AND THEY'RE SO MANY DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN WHICH- I KNOW THAT THIS IS INCREDIBLY. SPECIAL AND HELPFUL TO WORKING FAMILIES. WHEN WE SEE THAT THE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE- ON THIS PROPOSAL ANOTHER ISSUE THAT KEEPS RISING TO THE TOP OF THE LIST IS HOW WE PROVIDE SUPPORT TO TAXPAYERS WITH ZERO INCOME- THE MOST IN NEED. OF ADDITIONAL HELP AND THROUGH Y. C. T. C. PROPOSAL CAN DEAL IF EXPLAINS. THE PROCESS FOR HOW TAXPAYER WITH ZERO INCOME WILL FILE A WRITTEN AND TO RECEIVE Y. C. T. C. QUESTION CALL THE WHITE PART OF FINANCE AGAIN- THAT THE PROCESS FOR CLAIMING THE RETIREMENT ZERO INCOME WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT THAN SOMEONE THAT HAD. HAPPENED BECAUSE THEY WOULD NEED TO FILE A CALIFORNIA RETURN AND CLAIM THAT. CLAIM THAT YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT ON ON CALPERS TO STATE CALIFORNIA RETURN. IT'S NOT CAN YOU JUST ELABORATE ON THE DETAILS ON HOW THAT WOULD WORK PLACE. WELL YOU WOULD YOU I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE- ADDITIONAL DETAILS AS FAR AS IF IT'S REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE TAXPAYER BEING AWARE OF THE CREDIT AND FILING FILING A STATE TAX RETURN CLAIMING THE CREDIT. ON THE ON THAT TAX RETURN. BUT WHAT AN INDIVIDUAL TO FILE A FEDERAL TAX RETURN TO BE ABLE TO. FILE THE SAME STATE TAX RETURN AND BE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS. I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE TO FILE A FEDERAL RETURN IN ORDER TO DO THAT- THIS IS A STATE A STATE TAX CREDIT BUT GENERALLY YOU WOULD EXPECT. THE TAXPAYER TO FILE FEDERAL KERN AS IT FEEDS THROUGH ON THE ON. THE DATE OF THE START OF THE STATE TAX RETURN. THANK YOU I THINK. LIKE SOME CLARITY ON THAT MS HERMAN. SIR THIS IS JEANNIE HERMAN FRANCHISE DOT ORG- PERHAPS I CAN OUT SOME CLARITY INTO ASSISTANCE WELL CHAU CALIFORNIA LOT DOES START WITH FEDERAL AGI- AND THERE ARE TRANSACTION IN EXISTENCE FOR DECADES AND THE ON Q. REASONS WHY THAT IS BUT THAT BECOMES VERY FRIENDLY IN THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS WHERE. PERHAPS THERE IS NOT FINALLY MORE FOR THE FACT OR STATE. BUT THERE IS A INCENTIVE THAT CLAIMED THE ATTACK BETWEEN THE NEEDS TO BE. TAKEN CARE SO. HE DOES NOT REACH CAN. OF AND THERE'S RETURNS AND ON THE AGAIN AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY WE ARE GOING TO BE. DOING OUR BEST TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THESE FOLKS THAT REALLY AREN'T VISIBLE TO FRANCHISE TOP FOUR BUT NOT SO IN THIS WILL PERHAPS TO SOME OF OUR- PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND- YES SENATE. HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SO THAT THERE CAN BE OUTREACH BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE RELYING HEAVILY ON A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. TO START PUTTING OUT FEELERS TO SUGGESTS THAT- HANDED CREDIT. FOR INDIVIDUALS SAID THAT- THEY PERHAPS CAN GET SOME ATTENTION OF FOLKS AS WELL THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE OUTREACH TEAM. ONE THING INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIES THEMSELVES OR OUT REACHES PERFORMED DIRECTLY RATHER LIKE IT'S- SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS RATE TYPICALLY. ALL RETURNS FROM ACROSS THE NATION ARE PREDICATED ON THE PLANNING OF THE TAX RETURN IN AN ACCURATE TAX RETURN. WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDES THE COMBINATION OF FINE IN. FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RETURNS. AND THIS IS- AGAIN FOR MANY READ BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ONLY JUST TRYING TO PROTECT THE STATE BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO TAP THE TAXPAYER. AND WHEN RETURNED EFFORTS FOR FILING FALL OUTSIDE OF THAT TYPICAL REGIME THAT CAN BE A HAPPY- ADVENTURE FOR FRAUD. TO TAKE OVER WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO HELP TAXPAYERS ONLINE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO HELP THEM ONLINE BUT IT CAN IT BE STOPPED AND OTHER THINGS. UNCERTAINLY ALLOWS- OR PUTS US THE STATE AT A DISADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE TO SPEND RESOURCES ON COMBATING FRAUD. AND GETTING MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF THE STROKES. SELL OPTIONS THAT THEY CAN DO PUSHING WATER WILL BE CRITICAL AND THE SITUATION. SO THAT THE INDIVIDUALS CAN GET ASSISTANCE TO FILE AND OUR STATE OF THE MINIMUM LOOKING TO GET MAKE SURE THERE IS NO VALUE TO FILING THE STATE RETURN. BECAUSE THERE MAY NOT BE VALUE TO DATE DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NOT A VALUE LATER WITH THE NET TAX INCENTIVES THAT MIGHT BE ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE. THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY CLAIM. BY DOING A LOT OF THESE FOLKS- WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PACKAGE IS THAT. IN THE EVENT THAT A RETURN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAS NO VALUE. FIND IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO FILE ONLY THE STATE TAX RETURN. YOUR LAST AND. AGAIN IT'S A FREE TAX PREPARATION SERVICE. IN THE EVENT THAT. AN INDIVIDUAL- CHOOSES NOT TO GET IF I ORGAN NOT AWARE VYTORIN ISN'T. SITE OPEN. THEY CAN. HOW FILE TO DO THE- I'M AND THAT'S WHERE GETS TRICKY BECAUSE I WOULD. BE ONE OF THE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL JUST PLUG IN ZERO. ON THEIR FILING. ON THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN QUICKLY NOT AND YOU FRONT ROUTINES- INAPPROPRIATELY SO AND IT'S GOING TO TRIGGER A LOT OF OUTREACH SO. WE ARE STILL NOODLING THROUGH WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE AS FAR AS OPTIONS TO GET THEM INTO THE DOOR SIMPLISTICALLY. AND LEAST COSTLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. TO QUESTIONS TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I A- THE A- CONTACT TO THE SITUATION AT HAND. I HEARD YOU SAY AND THIS IS THE PART THAT SO I'M A LITTLE JUST PERPLEXED ABOUT. I HEARD YOU SAY THE RELIANCE AND NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH- A- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR CBO'S ON THE GROUND. AT TO DO THIS SPECIFIC OUTREACH PLAN AND ENSURING THAT MORE FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME WHILE REDUCING THE FUNDING FOR OUTREACH PLANS. I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT- ALIGNS AND SO I'M I'M GOING TO. THINK TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE AS WE MOVE THIS ALONG BECAUSE I DO THINK. FROM MY EXPERIENCE ON SITTING IN THE IN THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF RELIANCE ON CBO'S ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. AND AS WE KNOW. OVERWORKED UNDERSTAFFED UNDER RESOURCE. THOSE ARE THE EXPERIENCES OF THE CBO'S IN MY COMMUNITY AND ACROSS THE STATE WHEN I TALK TO OTHER. OTHER MEMBERS SO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. APPROPRIATING FUNDING NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE RESOURCES ON THE GROUND THAT ARE NEEDED. TO ENSURE THE MORE FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND THAT INCLUDES. OUR REACH DOLLARS I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHY INSTEAD OF. I REDUCING- THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR TO BE ABLE TO HELP WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND THE ANSWERS AND WE'RE GONNA. WE'RE GONNA KEEP THIS ITEM OPEN FOR THE MOMENT AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS THAT WERE HERE THANK YOU FOR THE IN PERSON TESTIMONY THINK IS THE FIRST TIME. I THINK WE'VE HAD IT WOMEN AND GIRLS WAS OUR FIRST ONE BUT THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX WHICH INCLUDES- WORKLOAD EXPANSION- MISS HERRIMAN. THANK YOU AGAIN GEN JERRY HERMAN TRAIN TRAIN TRACKS BOARD THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST F. T. V.'S- RESOURCES TO ACCOMMODATE WORK ON FOR F. T. B.

YES WORK BUT DOES REQUIRE A TO BE TO ENSURE RELEVANT DATA IS ACCESSIBLE INUNDATED AS A THAT USED BY UP TO THE EDGE OF THE REQUIRED ANNUAL REPORT. WHAT THE INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WHO HAS BEEN TASKEDWITH WRITING IN THE ANNUAL REPORT. WHAT'S YOUR NAME GENDER LAST THE QUESTION OF HOW THESE REPORTS ARE TYPICALLY DONE AND THE REVIEW PROCESS SAID THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. BASICALLY WHAT I WOULD SAY IS TYPICALLY WE NEED DURING THE MONTH OF JANUARY IS JANUARY AFTER FILING FEES AND SO THIS PAST JANUARY FOR THE TWENTY. TWENTY TAX RETURN. WE WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME ABLE TO RELATE AGGREGATE DATA FROM ALL TWENTY TWENTY TAX RETURNS THAT WERE FILED. AND SO ON AND THAT IS THE END OF JANUARY SO WE VERY QUICKLY PULL THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO CAPTURE. WHETHER IT IS A TAX CREDIT OR TAX EXPENDITURE REPORT WE ANALYZED IT WE BEGAN DRAFTING THE REPORT- INTERNALLY THERE'S THREE LEVELS OF REVIEW. THAT RETAIL AND THEN WE HAVE A LEVEL LEVEL. ALSO ENTERED INTO SEE. AND THEN ON CERTAIN REPORTS BUT MANY REPORTS WE HAVE A REVIEW ARM AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. ACTION REQUEST PROCESS THE CORE PROCESS. AND SO- SO MANY OF OUR AND THROUGH MULTI LEVELS ARE REVIEW BUT THAT SHE HAD. YOU AT ALL ASK THE QUESTION IS HOW DO ISSUE THE REPORT THE EXTRA GENERATED. TO THE CAKE. THAT ARE GIVEN TO US ON WHICH ARE TYPICALLY GOING TO BE A SENATE ASSEMBLY- Q. STOCK NUMBER TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH JAIL THE STATE. AND THEN THOSE REPORTS ARE TRANSMITTED- ACROSS THE VARIOUS SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OFFICES. THAT MAKE FIND OR TO BE. THAT REPORT IS ALSO ONLINE AS SOON AS WE'RE ABLE TO GET IT UP AND RUNNING ON OUR OPEN DATA PORTAL. THAT ALLOWS FOLKS TO ON THE PUBLIC TO ACCESS AND UNDERSTAND THOSE REPORTS. SO AT THIS POINT THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND ALLOWING ME TO ENTER DISTRICT TOPIC AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO THE L. A. O. PLACE- BROWN WHETHER FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO THE PROPOSAL REFLECTS A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW TAX CREDITS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED A LOT. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND IT ASSUMES THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL CONTINUE TO ADOPT AROUND FOR NEW TAX CREDITS ANNUALLY. SO WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY. TWENTY THREE IS REASONABLE BASED ON. THE ON THE INCREASED WORKLOAD. THE REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES ONE ADDITIONAL POSITION BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND THAT'S BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE NUMBER OF NEW TAX CREDITS CONTINUES TO INCREASE AT THE RATE HAS A ROBUST COUPLE OF YEARS. SO IF YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE WILL ADOPT SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER TAX CREDITS OVER THE COMING YEARS. YOU COULD CONSIDER REJECTING THAT PART OF THE REQUEST AND PERHAPS COMING BACK TO IT LATER ON. SINCE IT IS FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BRISTOL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL GRANTING INTERNET QUESTIONS THE NUMBERS MAY HELP.
