OTHER THINGS THAT'S DIFFERENT

00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:36.205
THAT'S CHALLENGING FOR I THINK

00:59:36.272 --> 00:59:37.540
ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS A PUBLIC

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:41.210

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:42.812
SAY THIS WITH ALL --

00:59:42.879 --> 00:59:44.414
ADDED DECORUM I GUESS I WOULD

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.349
SAY THAT EVERY BUT I I'VE SAID

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:47.350

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.499
IDEA BUT ARE THEY REALLY BASED

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:05.668
IN FACT AND AND POLICY THAT WILL

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:53.563
AS EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:55.064
CONTINUE TO RISE --

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.065
IT'S SQUEEZING OUT ESSENTIAL

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:57.466
SERVICES AND SO WHEN YOU FOR

01:03:57.533 --> 01:04:00.836

TWENTY FIVE YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:05.341

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:30.199
THE BACK OF THE EMPLOYER IF THEY

THE CITY FROM THE CITY'S

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.654
PERSPECTIVE --

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.155

KEEPING IN MIND OF WHAT THAT

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.153
IMPACT WOULD BE ON THE EMPLOYER

FROM CENTER HELLO --

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.345

AT LEAST AGAIN OVER THE PAST TWO

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:49.698
YEARS HAS BEEN VERY STRONG IDEA

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:52.535
ABOUT SOME MEASURES I'M AT BEST

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:53.736
MAN I THINK WHEN YOU GET TO THE

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:54.537
BUSINESS OF PICKING AND CHOOSING

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:56.071
YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE A SOLID

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.540
LINE -- WITH

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:59.208
REGARD SAID TODAY BEST RIGHT NOW

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.477
THE FUNDS INTO CRITICAL THE

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:02.511
PLACE TO BE TAKING TOOLS OFF THE

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:02.745
TABLE.

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:03.612
OKAY -- AND

01:08:03.679 --> 01:08:04.814
THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING I

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.182
JUST WANNA MAKE NOTE AND I

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.149
APPRECIATE THAT --

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:08.484
WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM LOCAL

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.219
GOVERNMENTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:10.453
ABOUT --

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:11.987
PENSION PRESSURES --

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:14.023
BUT I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:15.391
FOR EXAMPLE DRAIN RECESSION AND

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:17.193
SOME OF THE CITIES THAT --

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.594
THE LOCALITIES I WORKED WITH YOU

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.162
KNOW THE WORKERS ACTUALLY AT THE

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.065
BARGAINING TABLE GAVE UP OUR

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:24.834
SAID THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TAKE --

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.669
SALARY INCREASES BUT AN ORDER

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:27.903
PROTECTOR PENSIONS.

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.372
AND SO --

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.341
BECAUSE OUR FUTURE PAYMENTS.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.375
SOMETIMES IT'S EASY TO PICK ON

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:35.110
THEM AT BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T HAD

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:36.779
THE CANDY CASH OUT YET --

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:39.648
BUT I I I I THINK WE JUST NEED

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:41.317
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:42.952
AND THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW IF IF

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:44.687
THERE'S AN ISSUE ABOUT.

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:45.488
THEY ARE PENSION FUNDS NOT

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.089
PROVIDING ACTOR ENOUGH

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:51.927
INFORMATION. TO TWO TWO I GUESS.

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:53.696
THE LOCAL ENTITIES OR TO THE

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:54.930
UNIONS ABOUT WHAT THE COST MIGHT

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.298
BE IN THE FUTURE MAYBE WE SHOULD

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:57.600
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT BUT

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.735
ONCE YOU MADE AN AGREEMENT.

01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:02.204
I THINK IT'S I I MEAN I THINK WE

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:03.439
HAVE YOU A CAUTIOUS ABOUT SAYING

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.307
THAT WELL NOW THAT WE'RE YOU

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:06.442
KNOW WE'RE FEELING PRESSURE FROM

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:07.877
AN AGREEMENT WE AGREE TO AND AND

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:08.878
NOW WE WATCH I ROLL SOMETHING

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.212
BACKS I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.580
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:11.914
THAT.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.249
SOMETIMES HEARD THAT USES AN

01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:15.784
ARGUMENT TO SAY WHAT MADE IN THE

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:18.120
PAST YEAH I I CERTAINLY TEACHER

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:18.954
I CERTAINLY WILL --

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:20.756
AND WE DID NOT WANT TO COME OFF

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:21.423
AS A THAT WE WANT TO ROLL

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.825
ANYTHING BACK --

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.394
IN FACT IT WAIT WITH REGARDS TO

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:26.795
TO TO CONTRIBUTIONS I I'D GET A

01:09:26.862 --> 01:09:27.663
DAY PRINT THE EMPLOYEES OF THE

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:29.265
AT THE TO NEGOTIATE TO PAY PART

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:30.866
OF THE EMPLOYER PLAYER THE OUT

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:31.667
PERSPECTIVE SO.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:32.735
COMPLETELY GET UNDERSTAND YOU'RE

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.370
SAYING WHAT I ALSO THINK I WENT

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:35.671
OUT AND IT AND IT'S JUST THE

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.506
FACT OF THE OF THE TEACHERS ARE

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:38.474
MEMBERS BIG --

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:39.842
THEIR EMPLOYER BUT THEY'RE ALSO

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:41.343
AN EMPLOYEE SO THEY DON'T WANT

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:42.745
TO SEE THOSE BENEFITS ROLL BACK

01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:43.612
EITHER I MEAN IT'S KIND OF JUST

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.814
THE NATURE OF THE BEAST AND SO I

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.349
DON'T KNOW IN THE SCHOOL SPACE

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:48.250
THAT WE SEE IN ANY OF THOSE ROLL

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:52.087
BACKS.

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:55.090
I HAVE NOT HEARD OF THAT AT ALL.

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:55.624
ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY HAD

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.693
QUESTION.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.827
I APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION I

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:00.429
THINK WE ARE AT A VERY CRITICAL

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:01.230
TIME WITH THE SPECTER THE

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:02.831
PENSION SYSTEMS.

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:04.300
I THINK WE IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:06.535
NEED TO BE FOCUSING UPON REALLY.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:09.004
WHAT'S GOING ON IS BROAD FIELD

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.339
AND HOW WE STE TACKLE IT

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:12.207
SYSTEMATICALLY.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:13.108
I LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE LENS

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.076
YOU KNOW WE HAVE IN THE

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:16.412
GOVERNMENT CODE AT SECTION TEN

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:18.280
SIX HUNDRED AT SAC.

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:19.815
PROVISION FOR A JOINT COMMITTEE

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:21.884
RELATED PENSIONS.

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.652
IT'S EXISTING AUTHORITIES BEEN

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:24.186
THERE SINCE THE NINETEEN

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:24.653
EIGHTIES.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.755
IT ACTUALLY.

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:27.923
CONCEDE OF A LIBERAL JOINT

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:30.192
COMMITTEE [inaudible]

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:32.294
AND IT.

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:33.963
AS CONCEPTUALIZE BACK IN THE

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:36.632
EIGHTIES IT ENVISIONED.

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:37.900
A WIDE ARRAY OF OUR STANDING

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.501
COMMITTEES EACH FINALLY IN A

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:40.970
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT INTO THIS

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:42.438
JOINT COMMITTEE.

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:45.174
YET CONTEMPLATED A ADVISORY

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.109
PANEL OF THE TREASURE ANOTHER'S.

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.711
AN ADVISORY PANEL FINANCIAL

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.579
EXPERTS SO THE TOP.

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:51.814
A LAWYER WHO PRACTICES THE

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.582
PENSION FIELD A TOP INVESTMENT

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:57.653
ADVISER AN ACTUARIAL RESOURCE.

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.355
SORT OF TOP TIER PEOPLE IN THE

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.323
PRIVATE SECTOR IN WITH EXPERTISE

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:02.825
INVESTMENT THIS WHOLE RAVE

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:04.827
ISSUES. TO THEM LET THE

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:06.528
LEGISLATURE.

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:07.529
START TO WRANGLE WITH THESE

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:08.697
ISSUES [inaudible]

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:14.670
ON TO ME HE I AM VERY CONCERNED

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:15.437
BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT OUR

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:18.540
ECONOMY. TWO THIRDS OF OF THE

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.175
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ARISES

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:21.210
FROM INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:24.513
SPENDING.

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.248
SO WE ACTUALLY IF WE'RE GONNA.

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:27.583
LOOK AT HOW WE KEEP PEOPLE

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:28.684
WHO'VE BEEN IN THE WORKFORCE AND

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.786
THEN EXIT.

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:32.588
IN A POSITION SO THAT IN

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:33.422
RETIREMENT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.257
SPEND.

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:36.925
AND SUPPORT OUR ECONOMY ACTUALLY

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:38.227
GOES VERY IMPORTANT.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.662
THAT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THE

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:41.630
BENEFACTION OF SOMEBODY.

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:44.667
HAVING TO ROUTE A PENSION.

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.535
BECAUSE IT IS A PUBLIC GOOD.

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:47.970
DOLLARS PEOPLE HAVEN'T JUST BEEN

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.505
RETIREMENT HELP US PULL THE

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:51.740
ECONOMY OUT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.075
THE EIGHTIES A MOVEMENT TO FOR

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.477
ONE CASE.

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:57.813
WHICH TYPICALLY PEOPLE WE KNOW

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.249
AND THIS THE ELECTORAL COMINTERN

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:01.917
THIS GOING BACK THE NINETIES IS

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.786
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO INVEST.

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:04.520
PEOPLE GET IN THEIR

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:06.088
ORGANIZATIONS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.823
WITH FOUR ONE CASE THEY'RE DOING

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.625
FINE WHEN THE ECONOMY'S

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:10.893
ROCKETING ALONG.

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:13.128
WHEN THE ECONOMY TANKS THEY SEE

01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:15.197
THEIR ASSET SHRANK?

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:15.731
THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH TO

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.466
RETIRE.

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:18.767
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ENSURE

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:20.269
SOURCES BEEN RETIREMENT.

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:21.503
WHICH MEANS A CLING TO THESE

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:23.772
JOBS.

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.340
BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THESE JOBS

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.909
ONLY WAY ORGANIZATION PROPER

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.510
PRIVATE CAN SKINNY DOWN.

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:30.546
IS A LOT OF BLOOD IN THE AISLES

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:32.581
ORGANIZATIONS SPEAKING.

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:33.615
THIS THE FIRST YEAR BUILD A

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.050
CLEAN OUT THE SENIOR RANKS OF

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.019
PEOPLE AND OPEN UP NEW JOBS FOR

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:40.022
OUR NEW COLLEGE GRADUATES.

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:43.058
AND I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THE

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.426
REASONS SOME IS MOST FOR MORE

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:45.928
RESOURCE SESSIONS HAVE BEEN SOLD

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:47.096
LINGERING.

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:49.098
IS BECAUSE OF THE COLLAPSE IN

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:50.299
SPENDABLE MONEY FOR PEOPLE IN

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:52.768
RETIREMENT. TO HELP US PULL

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.570
OURSELVES OUT.

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:55.838
SO I THINK THIS FUNDAMENTAL

01:12:55.904 --> 01:13:00.375
ISSUE OF THE MODEL YEAR HER IN

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:01.276
WE DESCRIBE IS THE INTERNAL

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.778
COMBUSTION ENGINE DISFAVORED IN

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:02.978
THIS.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:03.946
CLIMATE CHANGE YOUR FOR MANY

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:06.048
REASONS.

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:08.250
IS BUILT AROUND A FLY WHEEL.

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:09.384
AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THE FLY

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.420
WHEEL IS THE PISTONS BOUNCING

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:14.256
BACK AND FORTH IN THAT BLOCK.

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:15.457
WHICH TO CREATE A HECK OF LOT OF

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:18.827
VIBRATION IF YOU'RE IN THAT CAR.

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.496
THAT BY BRIDGE GETS MOVED OUT

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.764
BECAUSE IT GETS TRANSLATED TO

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.899
SMOOTHLY SPENDING.

01:13:23.966 --> 01:13:25.134
FLY WHEEL INSIDE THE BLOCK THAT

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.402
SORT OF TAKES THE VIBRATION NOW.

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:28.504
AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE A

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:31.073
CERTI.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.442
THAT THE FUNCTION.

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:35.110
OF PENSIONS.

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.945
IS TO SERVE AS A FLY WHEEL IN

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:40.315
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. TO PROVIDE

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:43.085
A RESOURCE SO PEOPLE CAN.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:45.154
EVEN IN A RECESSION DECIDE I'D

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.422
ACTUALLY LIKE TO HANG IT UP.

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:48.223
I'D LIKE TO HAVE MORE TIME MY

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:51.160
WIFE MY GRAND KIDS GO FISHING.

01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:52.761
GO VISIT THOSE PLACES I'VE OFTEN

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:54.263
THOUGHT I WANT TO GO WHILE I

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:56.999
STILL HAVE MY HEALTH.

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:58.801
CREATOR MEANS FOR PEOPLE LEAVE

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:01.470
ORGANIZATIONS OPEN THEM UP FOR

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:02.871
THE NEW COLLEGE GRADUATES.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.706
JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IS A

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.475
CONSCIOUS TO HAPPEN I I ACTUALLY

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.476
THINK.

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:11.146
WE COULD DO LOOKING BACK TO THIS

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.614
MODEL IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE.

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:13.782
WE GET UNDER TAKE A MORE

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:16.351
SYSTEMATIC ROBUST THOROUGH

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:19.087
EXAMINATION AND THEN YOU START

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:19.521
TRYING TO DEAL WITH.

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:21.523
ALL -- PADS

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.192
AND OTHER SORTS OF THINGS BUT

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:24.459
YOU DO WITH AN INTELLECTUAL

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:26.395
FRAMEWORK WHERE YOU'RE SORT OF

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:27.896
UNDERSTAND OKAY IS NOT JUST A

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:29.097
BENEFACTION.

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:30.432
LUCKY THEY GOT THEIRS AND

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:33.368
SOMEONE ELSE GOT [inaudible]

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:35.003
MESSED UP.

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.138
AND PERSONALLY I ACTUALLY THINK

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:37.773
THAT THE WHOLE MOVEMENT TO FOR A

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.275
ONE CASE ARISES FROM THE AVON

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:42.077
LETTER WHICH WAS USE US

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.745
DEPARTMENT LABOR PAIN AND LETTER.

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.314
IN.

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.348
NINETEEN NINETY TWO THAT SAID

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:47.916
PRIVATE PENSION SYSTEMS HAD TO

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.785
VOTE THEIR SHARES IN ACCORDANCE

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:50.452
WITH.

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.688
THE BENEFICIARIES OF PRIVATE

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:55.591
PLAN SOMETHING GM CHRYSLER FORD.

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:56.925
THEY DIDN'T JUST WANT TO GO THE

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:58.694
ANNUAL MEETING VOTE THEIR SHARES

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.495
ON BEHALF OF MANAGEMENT.

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:03.131
BECAUSE THEY WERE THE GM FUND.

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:04.666
BUT THEY HAD OF VOTERS MOSES

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:05.834
SHARES BASED UPON THE WORKER

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.269
INTEREST.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.337
AND THAT OPINION HIT AND YOU

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.239
STARTED SEEING THIS MOVEMENT TO

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:11.039
FOUR OH ONE K.'S WHICH IS

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:12.674
ACTUATED BREAK UP THAT. FOR YOU

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:15.344
SURE OBLIGATION AND BUILT DAHLE

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:17.212
THE SILOS SO I JUST THINK

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:18.680
SOMEBODY'S TO JUMP INTO THAT

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.282
CONVERSATION I THINK HERE IN

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.150
CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN A GOOD

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:23.285
POSITION TO DO THAT.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.821
THESE SYSTEMS OPERATE OVER

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:28.090
THIRTY FOUR FRAME.

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:30.559
AND SO HISTORICALLY WE'VE SEEN

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.227
OUR PRINCES US IN A BAD PLACE

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.062
THEY DO ADJUST THE CERTAINTY

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.230
LEADERSHIP FROM.

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:37.199
FROM THESE TWO COMMITTEES IN THE

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:38.700
LEGISLATURE.

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:40.602
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE.

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:41.870
WE START GETTING INTO --

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.372
PAD IN THE BURDEN ON CITIES ALL

01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:44.673
THAT.

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.675
WE NEED SOME DETACHED REFLECTION

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:48.176
TO KIND OF REFLECT UPON WHERE IS

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:49.845
THIS ALL GOING.

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.179
WHAT'S THE ULTRA PUBLIC GOOD

01:15:51.246 --> 01:15:52.981
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.783
BECAUSE IT DEFINITELY IS HERE.

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.451
AND THEN START MAKING CHOICES IN

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:58.720
ACCORDANCE WITH THAT SO I I'M

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:00.455
SORRY FOR JUST JUMP.

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:04.059
BUT SOME REMEMBER O'DONNELL SAID

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:06.495
ABOUT THE FLY WHEEL YES.

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:08.063
EDU PRETTY BIG STUFF THERE

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:08.997
MISTER COOLEY --

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:10.599
BUT EITHER WAY JUST QUICKLY I

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.367
JUST WANTED.

01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:13.735
MISTER HUTCHINGS ELITIST I'VE

01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:14.603
GREAT COMMENTS ON DIVESTMENT

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:15.437
DOES NOT THE ROLE OF THE STATE

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:16.405
LEGISLATURE TO GUIDE THE

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:17.472
INVESTMENT STRATEGY.

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:18.607
ARE PENSION FUNDS IN THE STATE

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:19.808
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.443
AND WE NEED TO BE VERY RESISTANT

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:24.846
ON THAT OF LANGUAGE AND I'D LIKE

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:25.981
TO SEE THAT IN COMMITTEE WHEN

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:27.449
THOSE COME UP BECAUSE I'M SURE

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.784
IT'LL BE FIVE OR SIX THIS YEAR.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:29.952
AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.186
COMMITTEE WOULD REJECT THEM

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:32.120
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GOOD

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:33.388
STRATEGIES --

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:35.590
