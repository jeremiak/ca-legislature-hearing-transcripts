THE JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE ON RULES SO SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE THE SUIT THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT NUMBER HEARING THIS IS AT THIS MOMENT NUMBER FIVE. AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING A VERY. A COMPREHENSIVE DEEP DIVE INTO THE ISSUES SURROUNDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALL WITHIN AIMED TOWARDS REBUILDING OUR CURRENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND TRAINING FROM THE GROUND UP. AND MAKING SOMETHING THAT WILL BE PROTECTIVE OF OUR CAPITAL COMMUNITY AND ALSO I HOPE A MODEL FOR. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY A BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING FROM. OUR EXPERTS FROM ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY IN AND CERTAINLY FROM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TODAY'S HEARING IS ABOUT OUR PREVENTION AND TRAINING. AND FOR THIS HEARING OUR VICE CHAIR SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL OF WAS THE LEAD AND I'M GOING TO TURN TO HER TO MAKE WHATEVER INTRODUCTION SHE WOULD LIKE. TO THIS TOPIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR YES THIS IS HEARING NUMBER FIVE AND BECAUSE I'M ANAL. WE'VE HEARD SO FAR UP TO THIS POINT FROM TWENTY ONE WITNESSES IF YOU SAID FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE STATE AND HAVE SPENT OVER TWELVE HOURS. JUST IN HEARING THAT DOESN'T COUNT ALL OF THE TIME WE'VE SPENT PLANNING AND AND STAFF HAVE SPENT. AUTUMN COLD MEAN THE COUNTRY LOOKING FOR EXPERTS IN YOUR RESPECTIVE FIELDS TO COMMON EDUCATE US AND SO WE'VE WE HAVE INVESTED GOOD TIME. ON AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO THIS IS HEARING NUMBER FIVE. IN TERMS OF KIND OF OUR EXPECTATIONS AROUND PROCESS AND STRUCTURE IT WAS OUR PLAN THAT THE NEXT. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE LEAST TENTATIVELY FINAL HEARING WOULD GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THE RESULTS OF THE CLIMATE SURVEY. UNFORTUNATELY WE BOTH LEARNED YESTERDAY THAT REALLY THE CONTRACTING PEACE SO IT'S REALLY ADMINISTRATIVE. OF THE CLIMATE SURVEY HAS BEEN DELAYED UNTIL THE CLIMATE SURVEY HASN'T STARTED. TO OUR UTTER DISMAY A WE ARE FOLLOWING UP TO JUST KIND OF MONITOR THAT PROCESS WE'RE GONNA. I LOOK FOR TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN AND JUST HAD A CONVERSATION ALMOST THE VENDOR THAT'S BEEN SELECTED BEFORE THE THE SURVEY. IS EXECUTED AND SO WE CAN'T SAY AT THIS POINT WHEN THE NEXT HEARING WILL BE. BECAUSE THE COMMITMENT IS TO. THE VOTE THAT HEARING TO HEARING THE RESULTS OF THE CLIMATE SURVEY SOME I THINK IT'S SAFE DISABILITY AFTER SPRING RECESS. THAT IS NOT OUR DESIRE NOR WAS IT KIND OF OUR VISION AND PLAN. BUT APPARENTLY THE CONTRACTING PROCESS ON TOOK MUCH LONGER THAN I CERTAINLY ANTICIPATED OR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIRWOMAN SO I JUST WANT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO KIND OF KNOW. WHERE WE WERE AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN TERMS OF? EXPECTED NEXT STEPS. WITH THAT THANK YOU YEAH I JUST TO CLARIFY I'M THAT WILL BE OUR LAST HEARING TO DELVE INTO THESE ISSUES AND WHAT WE WILL ALSO BE GIVING DIRECTION TO STAFF AND COMING BACK AT SOME POINT WHETHER IT'S IN THIS HEARING OR IN THE JOINT CHOI GENERAL RULES COMMITTEE. TO PRESENT THE NEW POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REGARDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS YEAH POOR FOR ADOPTION HOPEFULLY I KNOW YOU KNOW IT AND THAT'S WHERE THE PUBLIC CAN ALSO I'M GIVE INPUT AND. I WILL FEEL MENTION THIS AGAIN AT THE END BUT BECAUSE OF THE. WHEN THE CLIMATE SURVEY STARTS THIS WILL BE I'D ON OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL MEMBERS OF STAFF TO. I'M PARTICIPATE IN THE CLIMATE SURVEY AND I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY DOES PARTICIPATE BECAUSE WE WANT TO HEAR. YOUR THOUGHTS AND AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO GIVE INPUT WE DO HAVE OUR SUGGESTION BOX WE HAVE WAYS THROUGH THE INTERNET TO. AWAY AND OF COURSE WE DO A PUBLIC A COMMENT AT EVERYONE OF THESE HEARINGS SO ON THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT GIVING US SOME INFORMATION OR GIVING US YOUR SUGGESTIONS. THIS IS THE TIME TO START YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT YOU DO THAT BEFORE WE COME BACK WITH OUR FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR THE NEW POLICIES. WITHOUT ALSO IF ANY OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE COMMENTS BEFORE WE BEGIN. I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER AREAS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR RIGHT ON A HAVE TO SAY THAT I REALLY I THINK THIS IS BEEN SUCH AN IMPORTANT JOINT. COMMITTEE TO TACKLE SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. UP AS WAS MENTIONED. BY SENATOR MITCHELL WE'VE HEARD FROM TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE EXPERTS AND WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH I THINK ONE OF THE. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS LIKE MY TAKE AWAY IS THE NEED FOR THE CHANGE IN CULTURE. I THINK THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT I ONE. DAY I WANTED TO COMMENT ALSO THAT. WE FOUNDED THAT'S OR LEAST I FOUND THAT THERE IS SUCH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MANAGING AN OFFICE OR MANAGING AN INSTITUTION. AND SHOWING LEADERSHIP IN AN OFFICE OR IN AN INSTITUTION. I THINK THE THE THE EMPHASIS HAS TO BE IN LEADERSHIP AND SETTING THE TONE WHETHER IT'S IN IN THIS INSTITUTION OR IN OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICES. AND FROM THAT WE LEARNED SO MUCH BECAUSE IT SETS THE TONE FOR THE REST OF THE STAFF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS SENATOR MITCHELL ANSWERED MY QUESTION. BUT MAYBE I COULD. ASK A LITTLE MORE. WE HAVE SELECTED A VENDOR YES AND DO WE HAVE A TIME LINE SPECIFIC. LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BECAUSE I I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS A PART OF THE INITIAL SCOPE OF WORK. I'M ASSUMING IN SOME OF THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT WE'VE NOT BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THAT. RULES PASS. BUT I AM NOW INSERTING MYSELF UP TO CLEAN GIVEN THE DELAY AND THE IMPACT IT'S HAVING ON THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND SO I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WITH REGARD TO TIMELINE. AS MYSTERY OF SAID YOU KNOW I I THINK WE ALL HAVE HEARD IN AGREE THAT CULTURE AND CULTURE SHIFT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS AND THE WHOLE POINT OF A CLIMATE SERBIA'S IT'S A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. REALLY OF CULTURE ON WHILE WE DO HAVE. A MET METHODS AND MECHANISMS BY WHICH PEOPLE CAN REPORT COMPLAIN EXPRESSED CONCERN BUT THE CLIMATE SURVEY REALLY IS A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT ARE WHAT WHAT WHAT CURRENTLY IS. AND SO. YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY IN THE PAST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO RUSH PROPHECIES BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE THOROUGH. THAT ASIDE I'LL I WILL BE ASKING THE QUESTIONS ABOUT TIMING OF THE VENDOR IN TERMS OF WHAT WE EXPECT AND AND WANT TO ECHO ON OUR CHAIR WOMAN'S. POINT ABOUT REALLY STRONGLY ENCOURAGING EVERY EMPLOYEE TO TAKE THE TIME TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLIMATE SURVEY ON BECAUSE THAT IS OUR WAY OF GETTING THE SENSE OF WHAT. YOUR EXPERIENCE IS CURRENTLY ASSA EMPLOYEE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE. I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ONCE I HAVE A SENSE OF THE TIMING WILL LET YOU KNOW. YOU'RE HAVING FUN DOING INDEPENDENT RESEARCH YES LOOKING AT THE RESULTS OF ANOTHER SURVEY YES AND. I DON'T NO FOOD THE CONTRACTOR WAS OUR THE FIRM BUT. THE RESULTS FOR A LYNCHING SO YOU CAN'T FIND TO SEE HOW IT LINES UP WITH. HOUSE CONDUCTED HERE AND THE RESULTS OF WHAT THE A SURVEY OF OF INDUSTRY WIDE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SIN AND IF IN MY CASE FOR ACCOUNTANTS GOT IT ACCOUNTING FIRMS WHICH I CAN RELATE TO YES JUST WHAT PERCENTAGE OF. MEN AND WOMEN HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS EVEN. A PROBLEM. AND IF SO JUST SERVICE IF I WAS. KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS TO SEE HOW IT COMPARES WITH BUT JUST THE INDEPENDENT I HOPE YOU'LL SHARE THOSE FINDINGS WITH US AND IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO KIND AYE. TO TO MEASURE OURSELVES. AGAINST OTHER INDUSTRIES I THINK WE DO THAT AROUND SALARY SURVEYS AND OTHERS AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE WE WE KNOW WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS LIKE CRITICALLY AS AS WE WORK EVERYDAY TO ATTRACT TOP TALENT TO WORK IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WITH THE UNIVERSE HEELS IN TERMS OF THE SAME KIND OF ISSUES. I HOPE YOU'LL SHARE THAT WITH THAT PHRASE YOU KNOW SOONER BUT I KNOW THAT NOW THAT YOU'RE ON TOP OF IT. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG ALRIGHT SENATOR MY COLLEAGUE HAS FAITH IN ME SO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I FRIEDMAN AND I WILL DO WHAT WE CANNOT BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE TO. THINK WHERE THAT PROCESS IS AND KEEP YOU ALL. TOOBIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SO WITHOUT WILL BRING OUR PANEL UP. KATHY RUFINO FROM TRAIN ME TODAY AND PATTY PEREZ FROM M. TRAIN. AND I WILL ALLOW EACH OF YOU TO INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AS YOU SEE FIT. AND THEN TO GO INTO THEIR PRESENTATIONS. HAD ALL ASK THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD ANY QUESTIONS UNTIL WE'VE HEARD BOTH PRESENTATIONS. AND AS YOU'RE TAKING YOUR SEATS LIKE THIS ONE APOLOGIZE. THAT THE WE HAVE SIMULTANEOUS COMMITTEES HAPPENING CENTER LATE ENOUGH WILL HAVE TO RUN TO HELP COMMITTEE TO ADD ON BOATS. BUT WILL BE BACK BUT SO PLEASE FORGIVE US. IT'S WELCOME. THE FIRST. OKAY. MY NAME IS KATHERINE FINO I AM A HUMAN RESOURCES PROFESSIONAL WITHOUT TWENTY YEARS IN HR. ALAS SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AS A CONSULTANT. A FUTURE. HOW'S THAT BETTER. OKAY. SO CHAIR WOMAN FRIEDMAN CHARWOMAN MITCHELL. AND THE DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CUT THEIR FEE NO MUCH TRAINER AND CONSULTANT FOUR EIGHT FOR TRAINING TODAY. I APPEARED BEFORE YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE SOCIETY OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SHARM. THE WORLD'S LARGEST HR PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY REPRESENTING TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND MEMBERS INCLUDING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. SURE MEMBERS IN TURN INFLUENCED THE LIVES OF OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION INDIVIDUALS WORK IN THE WORK FORCE. WHICH IS ABOUT ONE IN THREE AMERICANS. SO LET ME GIVE A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON US TRAIN YOU DAY HAS BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT WORKING IN THE HR FIELD FOR DECADES AND HAS TRANSLATED THAT KNOWLEDGE INTO A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS THAT TRAINS INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE BEFORE THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE. BECAME LAW WEEK TRAINING TODAY WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS. TRAINING TODAY HAS TRAINED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND HAS STRIVE TO CREATE. A RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ALONE WE TRAINED OVER FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE MADE UP OF SEASONED H. R. PRACTITIONERS TRAIN ME TODAY IS DEDICATED TO HELPING EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS ARE. CREATE RESPECTFUL WORKPLACES SO ALL STAKEHOLDERS NGUYEN. SO AS YOU HEARD THE SHERMANS USHER IN CEO PRESIDENT. JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JUNIOR SAY IN JANUARY WHEN HE SPOKE BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE. CULTURE TRUMP'S POLICY. AND WORKPLACES MUST CREATE A WHOLE LISTA CULTURE OF ON ON HARASSMENT THAT STARTS AT THE TOP. MISTER TAYLOR. IS ALSO SAID THAT COMPANIES CAN'T TO SOLELY RELY ON COMPLIANCE. WHETHER THAT BE RULES EDUCATION AND TRAINING. HOWEVER HE MADE CLEAR THAT THE RULES EDUCATION AND TRAINING ARE NECESSARY IF WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND ELIMINATE HARASSMENT. IN ORDER FOR AN ORGANIZATION TO FULLY SUCCEED AT ELIMINATING HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE IT MUST FOCUS ON BOTH ESTABLISHING AN APPROPRIATE CULTURE IN IMPLEMENTING AN APPROPRIATE TRAINING PROGRAM. TOO OFTEN ORGANIZATIONS FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE TRAINING AND NOT ENOUGH ON THE CULTURE OR VICE VERSA. OBVIOUSLY SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. I WOULDN'T BE HERE SPEAKING TO YOU IF THAT WAS NOT THE CASE FOR THE MEDIA OF OF SORRY FROM THE MEDIA TO GOVERNMENT. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS BROKEN. THE US EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING HAVE EACH RECOGNIZE THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM. SURE BELIEVES THE ONE MAJOR STEP IN FIXING THE BROKEN SYSTEM. THAT THE LET THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS FACING IS TO IMPLEMENT SUCCESSFUL SO SIR SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING PROGRAM. SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINER SUCH AS TRAIN ME TODAY HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING WORKPLACE TRAINING SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY. OVER TIME WE HAVE SEEN AWARENESS OF THE EMPLOYEE AND SUPERVISOR LEVEL GROW. BUT LESS SO AT THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT LEVEL. WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX SENIOR MANAGERS. HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO TAKE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS. SINCE THE LAW'S ENACTMENT ARE PRACTICES SEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT AWARENESS OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS. IF ANY TRAINING IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL SENIOR MANAGEMENT AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING IS NECESSARY. THE FOLLOWING ARE AYS IN WHICH AN ORGANIZATION CAN CREATE AN IMPLEMENT THE SUCCESSFUL. TRAINING PROGRAM. SO WE NEED MANAGEMENT BY END AT THIS TIME IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY MORE THAN ANY TIME BEFORE WE ARE FINDING THAT SENIOR MANAGERS ARE TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN THE TRAINING AND TAKING A PROACTIVE ROLE IN SUPPORTING. A RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE. WHEN LEADERSHIP TAKES ON THE ROLE OF MODELING OR CIRCLE A RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE THE REST OF THE WORKPLACE WILL FOLLOW. AS OUR ELECTED STATE LEGISLATORS WE LOOK TO YOU FOR OUR LEADERSHIP. NOT ONLY HERE IN THE CAPITAL BUT THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. ATTENDING AND PARTICIPATING IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING IS ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL SEND A STRONG MESSAGE. BUT THE LEGISLATOR TAKES THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY. SO TOO WILL ENSURING THAT SENIOR LEVEL EMPLOYEES FULLY PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING WHEN SENIOR STAFF EVADE TRAINING ON HARASSMENT DO TO WORKLOAD SCHEDULING CONFLICTS OR OTHER STATED REASONS. EMPLOYEES NOT ONLY DISMISS THE TRAINING AS WELL BUT THEY MAY NOT TAKE ANY TRAINING. BURKE HARASSING CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE SERIOUSLY EITHER. IN ORDER FOR TRAINING TO BE EFFECTIVE IT MUST BE ENDORSED BY THE LEADERS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT LIVE TRAINEES HAS HAS EXCEEDED ONLINE TRAINING INEFFECTIVENESS OVERALL. I BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO THE INTERACTION OF THE LIVE CLASS AND THE ABILITY OF PARTICIPANTS TO ASK QUESTIONS RECEIVE ANSWERS ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION IN REAL TIME. SOME COMPANIES HAVE SUCCESS HAVE SEEN SUCCESS A BLENDED APPROACH AND THAT INCLUDES SOME LIFE TRAINING AND SOME ONLINE TRAINING. THE ONLINE TRAINING CAN BE USED A SUNDAY UNIFORM MESSAGE ACROSS THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION AND REACH SOME EMPLOYEES THAT DO TO UNIQUE SCHEDULES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THE LIVE TRAINING. DURING NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS. THE LIVE TRAINING COMPONENT CAN THEN BE USED TO BUILD OFF THE FOUNDATION STEP BY THE ONLINE TRAINING. WITHOUT THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF A LARGER REMOTE WORKFORCE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER CONDUCTING LIVE TRAINING TO ALLOW FOR MORE ROBUST INTERACTION BETWEEN TRAINER IN PARTICIPANTS. WE ALSO WANT ADDRESS BYSTANDER TRAINING IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT EMPLOYEES FREQUENTLY BECOME AWARE OF HARASSMENT ISSUES LONG BEFORE MANAGEMENT. YET THEY OFTEN FAIL TO REPORT. THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR THIS OUR RELUCTANCE TO BECOME INVOLVED LEST THEY BECOME THE TARGET. ASSUMPTIONS OF SOMEONE ELSE WILL REPORT IT. UNAWARE OF REPORTING PROCESS. AND THE MERE THEIR PEERS SO OF THEIR PEERS STAY SILENT SO WILL THEY. EMPLOYEES NEED TO BE TRAINED ON THEIR ROLES AS BYSTANDERS IN THE AVENUES THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM FOR REPORTING ANY WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. TRAINING PROGRAMS NEED TO ADDRESS THE EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBILITIES IN HELPING TO FOSTER HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE HOW EMPLOYEES FILE REPORT AND THE INSURANCE OF NO RETALIATION. BYSTANDER TRAINING CAN EASILY BE INCORPORATED INTO THE HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING WHICH ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING COURSES. SO WE ALSO HAVE THE ISSUE OF IMPLICIT BIAS. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE UNCONSCIOUS IMPLICIT BIASES THAT EVERYONE BRINGS INTO THE WORKPLACE AND THAT TRAINING IN THIS AREA IS NECESSARY. FOR CREATING A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT. MUCH OF THE TRAINING WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST HAS FOCUSED ON DEFINING WHAT IMPLICIT BIAS IS AND TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED TO BE AWARE OF THEIR BEHAVIOR. AND THAT IT MAY BE A PRO BEEN APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER EFFECTIVE TRAINING NEEDS TO BE MORE THAN JUST SIMPLE AWARENESS. IT MUST INCORPORATE METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING WHAT IMPLICIT BIAS LOOKS LIKE IN ACTION. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PUT INTO PRACTICE A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAT HELPS EMPLOYEES TO CHANGE. TRAINING PARTNERED WITH AN ENVIRONMENT THE VALUES EACH PERSON EQUALLY AND THE LEADERSHIP THAT FOSTERS A RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE ON ALL LEVELS WILL PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINABLE CHANGE. SO I CAUTION YOU. AGAINST USING COST AS A DETERMINING FACTOR WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING A TRAINING PROP FORM. EFFECTIVE TRAINING SHOULD INVOLVE ALL HAVE HOLES OF PERSONNEL INCLUDING INTERNS PAID STAFF AND ELECTED OFFICIALS. TRAINING FOR MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES HOWEVER SHOULD BE SEPARATE SHOULD BE SEPARATE FROM THE TRAINING FOR THE REST OF THE EMPLOYEES. AS MUCH AS YOU MAY WANT TO CREATE A UNIFORM PROGRAM. MANAGERS HAVE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND NEED TO BE EDUCATED ON THESE RESPONSIBILITIES IN ADDITION TO INFORMATION PROVIDED TO ALL EMPLOYEES. SO HOW DO WE OVERCOME TRAINING OBSTACLES WILL. AT IT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT MANY ORGANIZATIONS RUN INTO WITH REGARD TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING IS BOREDOM. REDUNDANCY. OR A LACKLUSTER ATTITUDE FROM THE EMPLOYEES. AND WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED. ONE SOLUTION IS TO SPREAD TRAINING OVER THREE OR MORE SHORT WORKSHOPS THAT ARE HELD ONCE PER QUARTER INSTEAD OF ONE LONG DAY OF TRAINING. SOME ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ENTICED EMPLOYEES AND OFFERED BREAKFAST OR LUNCH OR EVEN DRAWINGS FOR GIFT CARDS. AND AS I STATED EARLIER EMPLOYEES WILL ASSUME THE ATTITUDE OF THE LEADERS IN THE ORGANIZATION IF THEY SEE THE LEADERS OPENLY EMBRACING THE TRAINING. THEY WILL FOLLOW. SO TO CONCLUDE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT TRAINING IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ERADICATING HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. AS PART OF SHARON'S RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING WE HAVE CREATED SEPARATE SAMPLE PRESENTATIONS FOR EMPLOYEE AND MANAGER TRAINING FOR OUR MEMBERS TO USE. AND CUSTOMIZE TO MATCH THEIR OWN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. IN ADDITION WE HAVE COMPLETE WE HAVE A COMPLETE LIST OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT TRAINING RESOURCES FOR OUR MEMBERS TO UTILIZE. TRAINING ALONE HOWEVER IS NOT ENOUGH. LEADERS LEADERSHIP. IS THE KEY WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION WHETHER IT BE AN INDIVIDUAL SENATOR. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOWN THROUGH THE CHIEFS OF STAFF AT THE IN THE CAPITOL OFFICES. SENDING A CLEAR AND STRONG STATEMENT THAT YOUR OFFICE WILL NOT CONDONE OR TOLERATE ANY FORM OF HARASSMENT OF ANY INDIVIDUAL WORKING YOUR OFFICE OR COMING INTO CONTACT. WITH YOUR OFFICE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO OUTSIDE OF FORMAL TRAINING PROGRAMS. LEADERSHIP FROM THE TOP IS A GOOD START IN ESTABLISHING A CULTURE OF RESPECT AND INCLUSION. AND THE SOONER IT IS EMBRACE AND PUT INTO PRACTICE THE BETTER FOR ALL THOSE WHO WORK IN IRAQ WITH YOUR OFFICE. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE INSURANCE COMMITTED TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AS IT ADDRESSES THE IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THINKS I ACTUALLY HAVE A. POWER POINT TO MATURE HOW WE GET TURNED ON. BEING HERE. PARA A. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND THEN VICE CHAIRWOMAN AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. I AM HONORED TO BE OUT TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. ON A TOPIC THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO ME AND ONE WHICH I DEDICATED MY ENTIRE TWENTY FIVE PLUS YEAR CAREER. AS AN EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY IN HR EXECUTIVE A BUSINESS OWNER ALLOW FROM SHAREHOLDER. AN EXPERT WITNESS AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST INTEREST TO THIS COMMITTEE AS THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR OF REGULATIONS CLARIFYING CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS AN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. MY NAME IS PATTI PRESIDENT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF WORKPLACE STRATEGY FOR AND TRAIN. A COMPANY THAT'S HEADQUARTERED HERE IN SACRAMENTO WITH OFFICES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M FROM SAN DIEGO SO I WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT I HAVE SOME OF MY VERY OWN HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT MY PRESENTATION TODAY IS GOING TO CONSIST OF FOUR PARTS. WHAT'S REQUIRED. WHAT HASN'T WORKED WHAT IS A RESEARCH SHOW ON THAT? WHAT'S CHANGED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT DOES WORK AND WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING. SO WE START WITH A REALLY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY REQUIRED. AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE AND S. B. THREE NINETY SIX TOGETHER. REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS WITH FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES PROVIDE TWO HOURS OF TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS. TO ITS MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS. THE TRAIN SHOULD COVER DETAILS RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT INCLUDING LEGAL DEFINITIONS EXAMPLES. METHODS FOR LODGING COMPLAINTS REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO VICTIMS AND A COPY OF THE COMPANY'S HARASSMENT PREVENTION POLICY AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS. AND TRAINING WAS ALSO COVER ISSUES RELATED TO ABUSE OF CONDUCT OR BULLYING. IT AND ISSUES RELATED TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND GENDER EXPRESSION. AND WELL VERSED ON THE DEFINITIONS OF REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THESE TRAINING. MANDATES SINCE AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IN MY ROLE AS A MEMBER OF THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING COUNCIL. I WAS THE PRIMARY AUTHOR OF IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS RELATED TO THESE REQUIREMENTS. AND I ALSO HELPED DRAFT REGULATIONS RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT GENDER IDENTITY AND GENDER EXPRESSION. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL MOVE ON TO HOW WE GOT HERE AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER. SO FIRST WHAT HASN'T WORKED. MIMI NERD BY NATURE SO WHEN ADDITION TO BEING. AN EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY I ALSO HAVE BECOME VERY WELL VERSED IN PSYCHOLOGY AND OTHER. AREAS SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY THAT TALK ABOUT OTHER OF RESEARCH THESE TOPICS. AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE KNOW. HAVE GOTTEN US WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK IN TERMS OF TRAINING INCLUDE. NUMBER ONE A CHECK THE BOX MENTALITY. SO TRAINING HAS BEEN INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT HAS FOR THE MOST PART. FOCUS SOLELY ON ISSUES RELATED TO LEGAL COMPLIANCE. THIS CONCLUSION WAS EXPRESSED POWERFULLY IN A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORT ISSUED BY THE EEOC SELECT TASK FORCE ON HARASSMENT PREVENTION. WHEN THE MESSAGE GIVEN TO EMPLOYEES IS THAT WERE ONLY INTERESTED IN COMPLYING WITH THE MINIMUM LEGAL STANDARDS BUT NOTHING ELSE. THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE TRAINING WILL NOT ONLY BE INEFFECTIVE BUT WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A BACKLASH EFFECT. ANOTHER ROOT CAUSE IS STANDALONE TRAINING. HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE DESIRED EFFECT IF IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE INCLUSION OF NECESSARY TOPICS SUCH AS IMPLICIT BIAS. DIVERSITY IN EQUITY. ABILITY AND RESPECT. BYSTANDER TRAINING COMMUNICATION TRAINING AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION TRAINING. SINCE THESE TOPICS CAN'T BE COVERED IN THE REQUIRED TWO HOURS THREE USUALLY IGNORED. THAT ALL EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS LEARN. IS THE LEGAL LANGUAGE OF UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT. UNREALISTIC EXAMPLES. WE HEAR OVER AND OVER FROM EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS ALIKE THAT WORKPLACE SCENARIOS WHETHER LIVOR ONLINE. INCLUDE UNREALISTIC EXAGGERATED AND OBVIOUS EXAMPLES OF WORKPLACE MISCONDUCT. WORDS I'VE HEARD TO DESCRIBE THIS TYPE OF TRAINING WILL RANGE FROM BORING. CHEESY. AND THEY ALL POINT TO A FEELER NOT ONLY TO PAY ATTENTION BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S NO LEARNING BEING INVOLVED WINDOWS OF THE TYPES OF SCENARIOS THAT ARE BEING USED. ANOTHER IS NOT BEING FOCUSED ON TRUE UNDERSTANDING. AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE THE RESEARCH SHOWS IS THAT HARASSMENT THAT PUTS THE BLAME ON ONE SIDE AND FAILS TO PROMOTE UNDERSTANDING EMPATHY AND CLARITY. HAS ZERO EFFECT ON BEHAVIOR. ANOTHER ISSUE IS THE LACK OF AUTHENTICITY. THE PEOPLE WHO AREN SUCCEED AND TRADING IS BECAUSE THEY ALREADY BELIEVE IF THEY WORK FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT VALUES AT SIX RESPECT AND INCLUSION. WITHOUT THAT FOUNDATION THE TRAINING IS VIEWED AS INAUTHENTIC AND IS THEREFORE INEFFECTIVE. AND ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WHERE THE VIEW IS THAT REPORTING IS FUTILE. ASK YOURSELF DO YOU HAVE A POSITIVE CYCLE OF REPORTING INVESTIGATING AND RESOLVING. IF NOT THEN EMPLOYEES ARE GONNA BELIEVE IT THEIR COMPLAINTS WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND TRAINING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT DOES NOTHING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE. WHAT'S CHANGED WHY ARE WE HERE TODAY. SO NOT EVERYTHING THAT IS FACE CAN BE CHANGED BUT NOTHING CAN BE CHANGED UNTIL IT IS FACED. AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF LEGAL SOCIOLOGICAL HISTORICAL. AND OTHER ROOT CAUSES. THAT EXPLAINED THIS VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. WE NEED TO FACE THE REALITY THAT TODAY. WE ARE AT A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT IN TIME. SO AS I MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET ONE OF THE MANY HATS I'VE WORN DURING MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER IS THAT OF WORKPLACE PROBLEM SOLVER. I CONDUCTED IN EXCESS OF TWELVE HUNDRED WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS DURING MY CAREER. I HAVE A LOT OF STORIES. MY INVESTIGATIONS COVER EVERY TYPE OF SEXUAL HARASSER EVERY TYPE OF ALLEGATION AND MOST OF THEM CONCERN SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND WHILE I'VE HAD EVERY VERSION OF ALLEGATION YOU CAN IMAGINE. INVOLVING DIFFERENT GENDERS INVOLVING SAME GENDER ETCETERA. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE HARASSMENT CLAIMS STILL HAVE TWO CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON. THE PERSON COMPLAINING IS A WOMAN. AND THE PERSON THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT IS A MAN IN A GREATER POSITION OF POWER. SO WITH THAT AS A BACK TO BACK DROP HERE'S SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE WORKPLACE THAT I THINK EXPLAIN HOW WE GET TO THIS ME TO IN TIMES OF MOMENT THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AND. WHEN I TALKED ABOUT ALREADY AND THAT IS COMPLIANCE BLINDERS OR A CULTURE OF COMPLIANCE. BORROWING FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDIAN SETH MEYERS I WOULD SAY THAT. I LOVE WORKING FOR A CULTURE OF OUR COMPANIES THAT VALUES COMPLIANCE WITH SAID BY NO EMPLOYEE EVER. SO THROUGH OUR EMPHASIS IN PROVIDING HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE WE'VE MISSED THE MARK AND FAILED TO FOCUS ON WHAT REALLY MATTERS WHICH IS PROVIDING A HEALTHY WORKPLACE CULTURE. ONE THING I FAILED TO MENTION IN MY INTRODUCTION OF THAT I'M A NATIVE OF EL SALVADOR. AND SO AS A RESULT DE CHOSE WHICH OR SAYINGS IN SPANISH ARE A BIG PART OF MY CULTURE AND SO I COME UP WITH A LOT OF SORT OF PITHY SAYINGS. AND ONE OF THE ONE THAT I COME UP FOR THIS CULTURE OF COMPLIANCE IS. IN PROMISING A HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE. IN MANY WAYS IS SIMILAR TO A RESTAURANT SAYING WE PROMISE NOT TO GIVE YOU FOOD POISONING. SO WE'LL DO THE MINIMUM. BUT THAT'S ALL WE'RE GONNA DO. NOT EXACTLY THE TYPE OF COMPANY THAT YOU WANT TO WORK FOR ENTITY ONE OR FOURTH. ANOTHER AND. ROUTE ISSUE IS NO EARLY INTERVENTION. BECAUSE TRAINING AND MANY CORPORATE PRACTICES FOCUSED ON THE PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION OF UNLAWFUL. CONDUCT. WE'VE DEVELOPED AN OVERALL CULTURE THAT IGNORES PROBLEMS AT AN EARLY STAGE WHEN PROBLEMS ARE STILL FIXABLE. IN THE REGULATIONS THAT WE DRAFTED FOR THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING COUNCIL SOMETHING I INSISTED ON WAS REALLY ROOTED IN LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY IN LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE. OF AN EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATION TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO PREVENT INCORRECT HARASSMENT. WHAT I INSIST ON WAS LANGUAGE THAT TRACKED DOT STATUTORY ON HISTORY? AND SAID THAT EMPLOYERS OUR OBLIGATED TO TAKE STEPS TO TAKE ACTION AND TO CORRECT MISCONDUCT. NOT UNLAWFUL CONDUCT IF YOU WAIT UNTIL IT'S UNLAWFUL WE'VE WAITED TOO LONG AND IT'S TOO LATE. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT BEING THE LAW IT'S GOOD BUSINESS. A CULTURE OF COMPLICITY. TRAINING A CORPORATE CULTURE THAT TOLERATES BAD BEHAVIOR SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK. AN IMBALANCE IN POWER AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. IS A HALLMARK OF MOORE'S MOST HARASSMENT CLAIMS AND WE'VE SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN DURING THE ME TO MOVEMENT. THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN IMBALANCE IN POWER IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF MANY OF THE WOMEN WHO HAVE COME FORWARD. THIS IS SEEN IN ISSUES RELATED TO PAY INEQUITY. AS WELL AS A SMALL NUMBER OF WOMEN IN KEY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. SO COMBINING AN IMBALANCE OF POWER WITH THE CULTURE OF COMPLICITY. MEANS THAT TARGETS OF BAD BEHAVIOR ARE DOUBLE VICTIMIZED FIRST BY THE PERPETRATOR. AND THEN BY AN ORGANIZATION THAT TURNS THE OTHER WAY AND FAILED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES EARLY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN THE PERPETRATOR IS SEEN AS A HIGH VALUE EMPLOYEE WHO SIMPLY CANNOT BE LOST. THEN ANOTHER ISSUE IS A FAILURE TO REPORT. SO STUDIES INDICATE THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN WHO WERE SURVEYED SAY THAT THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOME TYPE OF SEXUALLY HARASSING BEHAVIOR. WHY THE DISPARITY IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE QUESTION OF IS ASKED IF THE QUESTION IS SIMPLY HAVE YOU BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSED? THEN WE TEND TO SEE NUMBERS IN THE LOWER RANGE. IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE QUESTION IS VERY SPECIFIC HAVE YOU BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. THEN THE NUMBER SHOOT UP. THE LESSON IS CLEAR THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT UNFORTUNATELY DOES STILL HAPPEN IN THE WORKPLACE VERY OFTEN. NOW GIVEN A NUMBER OF INTERNAL REPORTS AND LAWSUITS. THIS MEANS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF INSTANCES OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR ARE NEVER REPORTED. EVEN ASSUMING THAT A FAIR PERCENTAGE OF THOSE EXAMPLES OF BAD BEHAVIOR ARE RESOLVED IN SOME WAY. IT STILL LEAVES A HIGH NUMBER OF CONCERNS UNADDRESSED AND INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT BEHAVIOR WILL ESCALATE. ESPECIALLY IN A CULTURE OF COMPLICITY WORD THE MESSAGE SENT IS NOT ONLY TO ACCEPT YOUR BEHAVIOR WE ENCOURAGE IT. THE OTHER REASONS FOR FAILING TO REPORT INCLUDE FEAR RETALIATION. A FEELING OF OF FUTILITY. OF FEAR OF BEING LABELLED AS A TROUBLEMAKER. OR FRANKLY JUST NOT KNOWING HOW TO DO IT. THERE'S A CORPORATE DISCONNECT AS WELL THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT. WE HAD AND TRAIN RECENTLY PERFORMED A SURVEY WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF WRITING A WHITE PAPER ABOUT IT. AND ONE OF THE THE REALLY STARK FINDINGS FOR ME WAS ONE OF THE PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK GENERAL COUNSEL AT CORPORATIONS WAS HOW. OFTEN DO YOU THINK SEXUAL HARASSMENT OCCURS IN YOUR PARTICULAR WORKPLACE. AND OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR RESPONDENTS SAYS IT NEVER HAPPENS OR IT RARELY HAPPENS. IT SOUNDS GOOD. UNTIL YOU GET TO ABOUT TEN QUESTIONS AFTER THAT. AND THE QUESTION WAS. ON A SCALE OF VERY COMFORTABLE TO NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL. WHERE WOULD YOU RATE THE COMFORT LEVEL THAT YOUR EMPLOYEES HAVE REPORTING? BAD BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKPLACE. THIRTY THREE PERCENT SAID THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES WERE VERY COMFORTABLE ARE COMFORTABLE. THAT'S A DISCONNECT. YOU ALL KNOW THAT HARASSMENT IS OCCURRING BECAUSE NO ONE'S TELLING YOU ABOUT IT AND THE QUESTION IS WHY AREN'T THEY TELLING YOU ABOUT IT. THESE STATISTICS SUPPLY. A PRIVATE PUBLIC FOR PROFIT NOT FOR PROFIT. UNIONIZED AND NON UNIONIZED PLACES ALIKE WORK PLACES LIKE. SO. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE WHAT DOES WORK WHAT DOES EXPERIENCE SHOW US? NOW THAT WE KNOW THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS LET'S TURN OUR ATTENTION TO WHY WE'RE HERE TO FIND SOLUTIONS. AND SOLUTIONS THAT WILL NOT ONLY BE EFFECTIVE BUT SOLUTIONS THAT ARE DOABLE. SO HERE ARE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I HAVE. THE FIRST IS OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON TODAY AND I THINK WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON WRIT LARGE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS WORK. AND THAT IS FOSTERING A POSITIVE RESPECTFUL AND INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE CULTURE. WE HAVE BEEN TREATING THE SYMPTOMS AND NOT THE DISEASE AND THAT'S A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER Q. WORK YOU IMPLEMENT FOR ALL WE KNOW IS A DISEASE WHICH IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT IS ACTUALLY IN LINE WITH OTHER PIECES OF THE PUZZLE. SO FOR EXAMPLE DEAR POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOCUS SOLELY ON LEGAL ISSUES. I HAD THE HONOR OF RECENTLY REVIEWING I AM AND HAVE FRIENDS WITH KEVIN KISHI WAS A DIRECTOR OF THE DFP AGE. AND HE SENT TO ME WHAT THE UP PROPOSED LANGUAGE IS FOR A MODEL POLICY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M DISCUSSING WITH HIM ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE THE CUTTING EDGE STATE THAT EVERYBODY LOOKS TO AS A AS AN EXAMPLE. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY PROMISING THAT WILL DO SOMETHING OF BEHAVIOR THAT IS ILLEGAL IS SOMEHOW IDENTIFIED. TO REALLY BE CUTTING EDGE AND TALK IN OUR POLICIES ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO BEYOND THAT WHAT EMPLOYEES READ WHEN THEY READ A POLICY THAT SAYS. WE DON'T TOLERATE HARASSMENT THAT IS BASED ON A PROTECTED CATEGORY IS BECAUSE OF ITS NOT BASED ON A PROTECTED CATEGORY. BUT IT'S FOR A GAME AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE DO IN TERMS OF POLICIES AND PRACTICES. FALLS IN LINE WITH SOME OF THE BIG PICTURE IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. EMBRACING A CULTURE OF TRUTH TELLING THIS TO ME IS A VERY VERY KEY. IN A WORKPLACE THAT IT EMBRACES THE IDEA OF BEING HEALTHY RESPECTFUL INCLUSIVE AND PRODUCTIVE. REPORTS OF POSSIBLE MISCONDUCT SHOULD BE WELCOMED AND SHOULD BE SEEN AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE WORKPLACE. FAILURE TO WELCOME COMPLAINTS AND FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS DOES NOT MAKE THE ISSUES GO AWAY IT SIMPLY ROBS US OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THEM AND TO FIX THEM. AND ONE THING THAT IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN TRAINING IS THAT THERE IS A FALLACY THAT GOOD TRAINING SHOULD MEAN LESS COMPLAINTS. IT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE SOMETIMES GOOD TRAINING MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD AND ACTUALLY LODGE CONCERNS AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE COMFORTABLE DOING SO. AT THE EARLY STAGE FOR SOMETHING CAN BE DONE. ANOTHER ISSUE IS TEACHING A NEW LANGUAGE AND PROVIDING TOOLS TO COMMUNICATE PRECISELY AND EFFECTIVELY. NOT DEFENSIVELY AND IN A CONFRONTATIONAL WAY. WHEN WE ONLY TEACHER EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS LEGAL LANGUAGE IT'S REASONABLE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS AND LANGUAGE NECESSARY TO REPORT BEHAVIOR. AT THE POINT WHERE IT CAN BE RESOLVED AS AN EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ISSUE. RATHER THAN IN THE PUBLIC RELATIONS SPHERE OR AS A LEGAL ISSUE. AND FINISHING IT OFF A COUPLE OF OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS MICRO LEARNING MANY LESSONS GUIDE SUMMARIES SCRIPTS. WE NEED TO SUPPLEMENT FORMAL LEARNING SESSIONS WITH BURSTS OF LEARNING TO REINFORCE WHAT IS TAUGHT IN FORMAL TRAINING. THE TRAINING NEEDS TO BE PERSONALIZED ALLOWING FOR QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED. AND FOR PROVIDING ACCURATE PRACTICAL AND REAL WORLD ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS. WE NEED TO TAKE A PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH SO FOR EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS. AND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD INCLUDE LEGISLATORS CHIEFS OF STAFF AND OTHER STAFFERS. WE SHOULD BE TRADE AT THE VERY LEAST SOME WHAT I CALL THE FIVE ESSENTIALS HARASSMENT PREVENTION IMPLICIT OR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS. DIVERSITY INCLUSION BELONGING CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS. FREE CHARTER WOULD ADD ONE MORE AND THIS WOULD BE IN THE RULES COMMITTEE. WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW AND THAT IS TRAINING ON HOW TO RECEIVE INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE COMPLAINTS. THE SURVEY THAT ARE REFERENCED EARLIER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LESS THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF INVESTIGATORS. AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THESE. PEOPLE SURVEYED. ARE ACTUALLY WELL TRAINED IN HOW TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS. SO. THE BUDDHIST TEACHER SYLVIA BORNSTEIN SAID WHEN WE SEE CLEARLY WE BEHAVED IMPECCABLY. THAT IN MY VIEW THE TASK AT HAND. IT'S TO CHANGE ISN'T TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR BUT RATHER TO THINK CLEARLY. AND AS A BY PRODUCT. BURNING BEHIND WILL BE HERE. AND AS A BY PRODUCT OF THAT UNDERSTANDING. WE ACTUALLY WILL SEE BEHAVIOR CHANGE. SO THE FINAL THING THAT I RECOMMEND. IS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF DATA. I DEAL TRAINING WILL INCLUDE A WAY TO TRACK ISSUES RELATED TO WORKPLACE. SUBJECT MATTERS THAT CAN BE ANALYZED AND USED TO CREATE A POSITIVE CYCLE OF REPORTING INVESTIGATING AND RESOLVING ISSUES EARLY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE. INFORMATION ON THIS TIMELY AND IMPORTANT TOPIC. THANK YOU THAT WAS ARE REALLY TO TRAFFIC PRESENTATIONS I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT ARE MOVED TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND I WROTE DOWN OUT OF SEVERAL THINGS THAT YOU SAID A YOU KNOW IT WAS VERY VERY HELPFUL AND VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM OTHERS SPEAKERS ABOUT. OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURE CHANGE. AND WORKING ON THOSE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT MAKE I'M. MAKE FOR AN UNPLEASANT WORKPLACE ANNA AND WORKPLACE IT'S NOT PROTECTIVE OF EMPLOYEES OR THAT VALUES OF EVERYBODY'S CONTRIBUTION SO THANK YOU. I'M WONDERING FIRST OF ALL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT JUROR HAS TALKED ABOUT AND OTHERS IS FINDING A WAY TO REINFORCE GOOD BEHAVIOUR. BY HAVING WAY BY MAKING IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO PROMOTE. SUPERVISORS TO. EMBODIED THE TYPE OF. THE BEHAVIOR WE WANTED ALSO CAN CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE VALUES THAT WE WANT TO BRING TORN PLEASE SO. DO YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW YOU CAN FORMALIZE AND ENCOURAGE THE PROMOTION OF MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS. THAT DO CREATE THE TYPE OF WORKPLACE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW DO YOU KIND OF WRITE THAT INTO YOUR POLICIES ARE MAKE THAT SOMETHING THAT'S DONE. YOU BOTH KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET IT OUT OF THE TO GO KEEPING IN MIND THAT WE TEND TO REWARD. SORT OF TYPE A BEHAVIOR ARE YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW ARE KIND OF GOOD AT GETTING LEGISLATION THROUGH WORK KNOW ABOUT PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT THAT BECOMES A THING HERE SOMETIMES THAT SCENE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. QUALITY TO HAVE AN END THAT'S NOT UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES UNCERTAINLY AS A LAWYER I I SEE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE VERY GOOD AT. A UNDERSTAND THE LAW. AND AND LITIGATING CASES I'M ALSO GET PROMOTED IN OTHER ARENAS PEOPLE WERE TECHNICALLY GOOD AT THEIR JOBS GET PROMOTED WITHOUT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS. PART OF THE SKILL SET SO TO TOOL THAT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND ARE UNDER UTILIZED. ONE IS A PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF DEBATE WITHIN THE CHURCH COMMUNITY WHETHER. THAT CONTINUES TO BE AN ANNUAL REVIEW WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DONE MORE OFTEN I FALL ON THE SIDE OF IT SHOULD BE DONE MORE OFTEN THAN THAT. BUT IN WHATEVER MANNER THAT YOU DO IT HAVING VERY MEASURABLE AND SPECIFIC. EXPECTATIONS BOTH OF BACKWARDS LOOKING FORWARD LOOKING MEANING. AT YOU KNOW AT THE OUTSET IS A BASELINE YOU SAY HERE'S WHAT I EXPECT FROM YOU OF COURSE I EXPECT TO BE TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT IN YOUR JOB. BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BE IN A MANAGEMENT POSITION AND ACTUALLY OVERSEEING PEOPLE THAN THAT PART OF IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND HERE'S WHAT WE EXPECT. AND THEN. BACKWARD LOOKING IS ONCE YOU'VE ESTABLISHED THAT EXPECTATION MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE MEETING THAT. SO USING THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. OR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM I THINK IS ONE REALLY UNDER UTILIZED TOOL THE OTHER UNDER UTILIZED TOOL WOULD BE JUST THE JOB DESCRIPTION WHICH GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THAT. AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE EXPECTATIONS ARE MADE. EXCEEDINGLY CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING THOSE POSITIONS. AND FRANKLY THAT DAD THOSE TOOLS ARE THEN USED TO EITHER. AND. ASSIST IN THE PROMOTION IN OTHER WORDS YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB YOU GET REWARDED AS A RESULT OF MEETING THOSE EXPECTATIONS. BUT. IF IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF JOB JOB DESCRIPTION AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT THEN YOU ALSO GET DIDN'T FRANKLY IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT. AND THAT'S KIND OF THE IDEA OF THE HIGH VALUE EMPLOYEE THAT I TALKED ABOUT IS THAT TOO OFTEN PEOPLE WILL OVERLOOK. DEFICIENCIES WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE MANAGEMENT IF YOUR EXCELLENT TECHNICALLY AND THAT'S GONNA CHANGE. I'M WE HEARD ON OUR LAST. A HEARING FROM OF SOMEBODY WHO WORKS IN THE RESTORED OF JUSTICE SERENA AND WHAT WAS INTERESTING WAS THAT THEY WERE PRESENTING THE RESORT OF JUSTICE TECHNIQUES NOT JUST AFTER THERE WAS AN ISSUE AS A PATH TO. YOU KNOW KIND OF HEALING FOR VICTIM AND FOR THE YOU KNOW THE BETTER LACK OF A BETTER WORD THE PERPETRATOR. BUT THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT BRING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE TECHNIQUES INTO THE TRAINING AND USING THE TYPES OF. OF MORE FACE TO FACE AN INTERACTIVE. TRAINING AS A WAY TO HELP AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU'VE SEEN THAT DONE IN LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AND WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCES AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S NOW BEING LOOKED OUT MORE TO COME. AS A WAY OF MAKING THE TRAINING MORE VALUABLE. SO ALL OF OUR TRAINING THAT WE DO A TRAINING TODAY IS INTERACTIVE SO ON THE HANDOUTS THAT WE GAVE JUST GOOD TO DELIVER TO YOU. THE AUSSIE PLAYING CARDS ON EACH SLIDE. BECAUSE SUPERVISORS HAVE A TENDENCY TO SIT IN THE BACK WITH THEIR HEAD DOWN IN THEIR TEXTING WHILE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THIS MANDATED TRAINING THAT THEY ALL DISLIKES THAT WE FIGURED OUT A WAY NO YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE IN YOU HAVE TO. BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. IN ORDER TO LEARN WHAT WE NEED TO LEARN AND TAKE IT BACK TO YOUR WORKPLACE AND ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IT. SO THE PLAYING CARDS MAKE THEM BE A LITTLE INTERACTIVE BUT IT ALSO TAKES WHEN THEY FIRST SIT DOWN IN THE ROOM. THEY SEE THESE PLAYING CARDS AND IT TAKES. THE DREARY NESTS OUT OF THE TRAINING THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE COMING TO AND MAKES A LITTLE MORE FUN AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HUGE INTERACTION. AND A LOT OF CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS TRAINING TODAY. THAT I THINK THAT THEY IT WASN'T SO MUCH THAT IT WAS INTERACTIVE TO IT WAS A TYPE OF OF SORT OF EMPATHY TRAINING AND GETTING AT THE ROOT OF WHAT YOU KNOW THE TWO OF THE IT. INTERPERSONAL DYNAMICS THAT PEOPLE BRING THE THINGS IN A WAY THAT WAS. NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ANY. ABOUT ANY KIND OF HARASSMENT THE WAY THE TYPICAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING IS BUT REALLY ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S FOR PERSPECTIVES AND COMMUNICATE BETTER. SO AT ON OF THOUGHTS AND HOW DID THAT DELIVERS THAT CONVERSATION SO WHEN YOU MAKE IT MORE INTERACTIVE AND THEY'RE MORE ENGAGED WE. ARE TRAINING TYPICALLY WE TELL THEM THAT'S MANDATED TWO HOURS I HAVE YET IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO DO TRAINING LESS THAN THREE HOURS BECAUSE OF THEIR QUESTIONS NOT BECAUSE OF OUR TRAINING. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY OPEN ABOUT THEIR CONVERSATIONS WELL WHAT IF THIS HAPPENED. AND WHAT IF YOU SAW THIS AND WE TALK ABOUT IT AND IT COULD BECOMES MORE REAL TO THEM BECAUSE IS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR WORKPLACE THEY HAVE A POINT OF REFERENCE THAT THREE. AND SO IT DOES MAKE A CHANGE. BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE OPEN TO ADDRESSING THAT AND I THINK THAT'S. PART OF WHERE THE IMPLICIT BIAS COMES INTO BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WHERE PEOPLE GO. WELL YOU KNOW THIS HAPPENED AT A PLACE I WORKED. YEAH THIS HAPPENED TO A FRIEND THAT I KNOW AND IT'S THEIR OWN BIAS IN THERE'D DO IN A CHECK THEY'RE DOING A SELF TECH LIKE IS THIS. A MILE IN THE FINE LINE HERE AND SO IT OPENS UP THAT CONVERSATION. LIKE I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT MAKING THE TRAINING RELEVANT TO YOUR WORKPLACE WE HAVE A PRETTY UNIQUE WORKPLACE HERE. AND THE TRAINING THAT THAT WE DO IS NOT AT ALL UNIQUE TO OUR WORKPLACE IT'S. YOU KNOW IT'S VERY DATED AND IT'S VERY GENERIC AND IT'S YOU KNOW BOB IN TEEN AT THE WATER COOLER IN. AND WE HAVE SOME I'M OFTEN TINA LITERALLY FOUGHT OFF ROBIN TINA I KNOW THEM. AND. YOU KNOW US TRYING TO CREATE SOMETHING AT LEAST YOU KNOW MAYBE S. A DIFFERENT TRAINING FOR MEMBERS THAT REALLY FOCUSES ON THE TYPE OF EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE THAT'S DIFFERENT AND PUTTING US IN SOME OF THOSE. MORE PROBLEMATIC SITUATIONS AND KIND OF WORKING THIS THROUGH SOME OF THOSE. SITUATIONS AYE AYE VISITORS RIFIC IDEA AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT YOU. YOU KNOW BROUGHT THAT TO THAT TO THE FOREFRONT OF KIND OF HOW IRRELEVANT THE TRAINING IS. THAT WE HAVE FROM UP FROM A CONTENT PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT THE AYE SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT I REFER TO AS SORT OF MY FIVE ESSENTIALS OF THE LIBRARY. IT WILL NECESSARILY INCLUDE WITHIN THEIR OWN IN COMMUNICATION BROUGHT TRAINING FOR EXAMPLE A LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING AND EMPATHY SO THAT LEVEL YOU KNOW RATHER THAN SEEKING. TO TO CHANGE SOMEONE'S MIND TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR TO REALLY DO THINGS IN A WAY THAT THE TRAINING. LETS PEOPLE SEE. THE OTHER SIDE THE POINT LET'S PEOPLE SEE WHAT ANOTHER PERSON MIGHT VIEW SO DELIVERING IT IN A WAY THAT I THINK REALLY FOCUSES ON THAT EMPATHY. THE TRICK WOULD BE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS RELEVANT TO THE WORKPLACE SO THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ISSUES I THINK ARE. ANALOGOUS BUT THEY'RE NOT. IMMEDIATELY ANALOGOUS YOU YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU PUT THEM IN THE CONTEXT THAT IS GOING TO BE. RELEVANT TO THE WORKPLACE THE OTHER WAY IN WHICH IN ADDITION TO TRAINING THAT I SEE THE CONCEPT OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE USED REALLY EFFECTIVELY. IS AND WHAT I CALL WORKPLACE MEDIATIONS AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE MECHANISMS ESTABLISH WHETHER IT'S HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE OR IN PRIVATE. ENTITIES HAVING. AND ON THAT'S PERSON HAVING SOMEBODY WHO WAS REALLY ABLE TO. MEDIATE DISPUTES AT AN EARLY STAGE IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE IS IS IMPORTANT THERE. I WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING REPLACE MEDIATIONS I ACTUALLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHO HAD BEEN A FEDERAL MAGISTRATE AND HAD IT WAS NOT DOING PRIVATE MEDIATIONS. AND THAT HE CAPTURED PERFECTLY HE SAID YOU KNOW PATTY WHAT I DO IS TO FORCE A COUNSELING WHAT YOU DO IS MARRIAGE COUNSELING. AND AGAIN WE CAN'T MAKE TOO MANY ANALOGIES BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BUT IT IT RANG TRUE THAT WHAT I'M DOING IS TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE TOGETHER WHEN I'M TRYING TO DO IS. INCREASE AT LEVEL OF EMPATHY AND FAIRS REMINDING THAT MEMBERS COME I HEAR FROM MANY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES OUT A LOT OF MEMBERS HAVE NEVER MANAGED OUT BEFORE AND WE MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF DOING THAT WITHOUT GIVING THEM. THE BACKGROUND THE TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT REQUIRES AND AND EVEN CHIEFS A LOT OF OUR CHIEFS COME TO US THROUGH CAMPAIGNS THROUGH. ALL KINDS OF OTHER WORK AND I THINK THAT OFFERING THAT TO OUR CHIEFS TO OUR MEMBERS. IS SOMETHING THAT COULDBE EXTREMELY VALUABLE HARM TO US NOT JUST WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT HAVING A BETTER FUNCTIONING WORKPLACE AND TO DISTRICT DIRECTORS I MEAN I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT. I'VE I'VE YOU KNOW. WHAT IT WOULD THEY DON'T COME TO THIS POSITION TO THE NATURAL SELECTION NATURAL SELECTION PROCESS THAT OTHER SUPERVISORS DO OF WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE RANKS AND HAVING TO DEMONSTRATE AND LEARN THOSE SKILLS SO I? REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR I'M HIGHLIGHTING THAT AND BRING THAT TO US SOME MEMBER WALDRON I BELIEVE YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP AND. WE'LL GO HOME WHERE I THINK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY INFORMATIVE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COME UP WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS CULTURE IDEA. WHICH ARM YOU KNOW I THINK IS REALLY. THE WAY ULTIMATELY IT'S GONNA NEED NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. BOB YOU KNOW I TRY TO VISUALIZE WHAT WOULD THAT CULTURE BE AND IT'S YOU KNOW THE TRAINING BUT THEN EVERYONE WALKS OUT OF TRAINING AND THEN THERE AND WORK IT'S KINDA LIKE GOING TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY AND THEN ON MONDAY YOU KNOW YOU'RE. WHO TALK ON THE WORK AND THAT'S ALL FORGOTTEN BUT? HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THAT CULTURE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I TRY TO VISUALIZE? THE WAY OUR LIFESTYLE IS HERE. YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING AND GOING. SOMETIMES VERY INTENSE SITUATIONS STRESS. LOT OF SOCIALIZING A LOT OF YOU KNOW WORDS GOING AROUND. TO ME A CULTURE WOULD BE AN INCIDENT OCCURS MAY BE. A VERY SLIGHT INCIDENT. BUT. OTHERPEOPLE STEP IN AND SAY ALL BACK OFF OR THEY SEE IT LIKE THERE'S. A SUPPORT APPEARS AROUND. I MEAN AND HOW DO YOU. GET TO THAT POINT BECAUSE SUSTAINING IN TRAINING IT SO MUCH MORE AND I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT OF SOME MICHAEL TRAINING OF THOSE LIKE LITTLE BOOSTERS SAY. AND HOW OFTEN WOULD THAT BE. TO KEEP YOU KNOW TO TRY TO CREATE AND WE'VE EMPLOYEES COMMON GOAL ALL THE TIME. WE HAVE SOME VERY YOUNG STAFF OR INTERNS THEY'RE ONLY THERE FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN THEY'RE GONE TOO. IN A BIGGER AND BETTER. AND THAT'S BEEN SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SEEN SO. I NEED ALL BE HAPPY TO SHARE AND WILL WITH WITH JESSICA SOMETHING THAT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A COUPLE OF OF RESOURCES WE PUT TOGETHER THAT I THINK MIGHT BE REALLY HELPFUL TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. ONE IS A LOT OF AT LEAST PART OF CORPORATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING A STEP WHICH I THINK IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THEM AND EXECUTING IT AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD. OF SENDING A LETTER FROM THE CEO TO ALL EMPLOYEES SAYING LOOK WE CARE ABOUT THIS ME TO SITUATION WE UNDERSTAND WE REALLY WANNA BE DIFFERENT. BUT FRANKLY IT'S THE SAME OLD SAME OLD AND SO IT'S A LETTER THAT SAYS WE REALLY CARE ABOUT NOT HAVING UNLAWFUL ARRESTS IN THE WORKPLACE. HERE'S A COPY OF OUR POLICY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'VE WRITTEN SENATE TEMPLATE LETTER THAT SAYS AYE HERE'S THE PROMISE WE MADE TO YOU AND HERE'S WHAT WE EXPECT IN RETURN. WHAT WE PROMISE YOU IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO TEACH A COMMON LANGUAGE WHERE WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE? ONE OF OUR SIGNATURE TOOLS AT AND TRAIN IS SOMETHING WE CALL THE WORKPLACE COLOR SPECTRUM AND IT IS A WAY OF TAKING LEGALLY CHARGED. DEFENSIVE OF LANGUAGE THAT COULD INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE INSTEAD OF DECREASE SAID AND BRING IT DOWN TO A LEVEL WHERE EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND IT SO IT'S LITERALLY A COLOR SPECTRUM ECHOES FROM GREEN. TO. YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED AND A WE GIVE EXAMPLES WHERE RATHER THAN SAYING YOU BIG JERK WHAT YOU JUST SAID WAS SEXIST AND AND HARASSING YOU SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT BOB THAT WAS. ORANGE A COMMENT AND AND IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT IS. OFFENSIVE TO ME AND PROBABLY TO OTHERS SO IT NOT ONLY PROVIDES A REALLY EASY WAY FOR THE PERSON TO BE ABLE TO. EXPRESS ANY TYPE OF OF CONCERN IT ALSO PROVIDES A REALLY EASY WAY FOR BY SANDERS TO BE ABLE TO SAY HEY WAIT A MINUTE EVEN IF THAT PERSON DIDN'T SPEAK UP THAT WAS A DARK YELLOW YOU KNOW GOING INTO ORANGE COMMENT. ON THE OTHER THING THAT WE FOUND THAT IT DOES IN THIS GOES BACK TO THE EMBASSIES UNDERSTANDING. IS THAT WE HAVE FOUND AND ESPECIALLY VERY VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WE DON'T ALL SEE THE WORLD THE SAME WAY. AND SO ME SAYING THAT SOMETHING IS ORANGE. THE PERSON WHO MADE THE STATEMENT MIGHT SAY THAT WAS GREEN TO ME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DISCONNECT IS. A STATISTIC THAT I OFTEN SITE IN TERMS OF MY INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONDUCTED PEOPLE ARE OFTEN SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM. HAD NO FACTUAL DISPUTE IT WASN'T A HE SAID SHE SAID SITUATION IT WAS THIS IS WHAT'S ALLEGED THE PERSON ACCUSED SAYS YES THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. SO WHAT. AND IT WAS TRULY JUST A DIFFERENCE IN PERCEPTION AND IN UNDERSTANDING OR FEELING WHAT ONE PERSON FELT WAS APPROPRIATE THE OTHER FELT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. SO YOU KNOW CREATING A COMMON LANGUAGE HAVING TOOLS THAT GO BEYOND JUST YOUR POLICY THE TALK ABOUT. PAT BUT THE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT. I THINK SLOWLY OVER TIME WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS PUT INTO PLACE OF THE MICRO LEARNING LESSONS WOULD WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A NEED TO CAMPAIGN FOR EXAMPLE THAT ADDRESSES EACH CONSTITUENCY. SO THE FIRST VIDEO THAT WE PUT OUT A VERY SHORT TWO MINUTE VIDEO THAT WENT OUT TO. ALL OF OUR. OUR AUDIENCE WAS INTRODUCING THIS CONCEPT OF A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. THE NEXT ONE WAS WHAT IF ON A TARGET AND IT'S OFFERING ACTUAL PRACTICAL LANGUAGE A SCRIPT FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY IF YOU WERE EXPOSED MISCONDUCT. AND THEN A HANDOUT THAT SAYS IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE DEALING WITH IT YOURSELF WHEN YOU GO TO A CHARTER SAY THIS NOT THAT. SO WOULD ACTUALLY AGAIN DECREASES THE TEMPERATURE. WE'VE ANOTHER VIDEO AT A DESK ADDRESSES WHAT IF YOU'RE A BYSTANDER HERE SOME VERY PRACTICAL UP WORDSTHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE TO ACTUALLY DEFUSE A SITUATION. WHAT IF I'VE BEEN ACCUSED? AGAIN ALL VERY PRACTICAL INFORMATION ON WAYS THAT YOU CAN AVOID BEING ACCUSED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE ACCUSED. I'M AN ATTORNEY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I SAY IS HOW PUT YOU APOLOGIZE. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO. SO REALLY I THINK OFFERING A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH EVERYTHING POINTS. TO THE SAME DIRECTION WHICH IS IMPROVING THE CULTURE. IT TRICKLES DOWN AND EVERYTHING ELSE JUST SORT OF FALLS INTO PLACE. I MEAN BECAUSE ONE YOU KNOW HEREABOUTS THE. SOME OF THE VICTIMS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD. THEA YOU KNOW JUST THE STRENGTH IT TOOK TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST LEAVING IT ALONE I MEAN THERE WAS NO PEER SUPPORT HER HINAULT. THAT STOOD UP FOR THEM AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN A WAY ISOLATED. SO YOU KNOW WE REALLY WANTED TO THE OFFICES. AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER IT YOU KNOW THE POWER SITUATION THAT'S PERCEIVED IN ONLY OF WHAT THE SENATOR SAY WORLD FOOD SUMMIT PERSON AND. YOU KNOW AN INTERN OR A YOUNG PERSON AND THINGS OCCUR AND STAFF PEOPLE AROUND MIGHT SEE BUT THAT WHO'S GOING TO STEP IN AND I THINK. EMPOWERING THE VICTIM. NO IN A WAY. THAT THE PEER OVER THERE AND THEY STEP IN ONE THE OTHER ONE CAN FOR EVERYONE LIKE YOU'RE SAYING THE CULTURE. STARTS TO GROW SO THEY UNDERSTAND THOSE LEVELS OF YOU KNOW WHAT LEVEL WAS THAT. STEP IN. AND THAT PREVENTS IT FROM ESCALATING TO A POINT WHERE THEN WE REALLY HAVE. YOU KNOW THE SITUATION. SO BUT I JUST JUST ONE QUICK OTHER RUN. YOU TALK ABOUT DATA AND YOU KNOW HAVING DATA WHAT TYPES OF DATA WOULD. WE LOOK TO COLLECT FROM TO IMPLEMENT THAT KIND OF DATA DRIVEN PROGRAM. WEALTH I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT WHAT ARE OR APPROACHES THE WATER SOLUTION IS. AND IN OUR. IN OUR CURRENT TRAINING PLATFORMS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY ROBUST Q. AND A SECTION WHERE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ACTUALLY RECEIVE. REAL LIFE QUESTIONS FROM THE LEARNERS AND WERE ABLE TO ANSWER THEM IN A. ACCURATE BUT BUT ALSO VERY PRACTICAL WAY. AND WE ARE ABLE TO THEN COLLECT DATA ON THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED HOW MUCH TIME PEOPLE ARE SPENDING ON THE QUEUE IN A SECTION. HOW MUCH TIME THEY'RE SPENDING ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRAINING SESSION AND IT'S REALLY VERY VERY INFORMATIVE IN TERMS OF? POTENTIAL BLIND SPOTS WHERE YOU KNOW THINGS MIGHT BE GOING AWRY. WE HAVE AN UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING COURSE THAT ASKS THEM REALLY REALLY FASCINATING POLLING UESTIONS AND IN THE END RESULT IN A IN A DATA ANALYTICS REPORT THAT SAYS THINGS LIKE. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG IN YOUR? INDUSTRY OR EXCUSE ME IN YOUR COMPANY. IT HAS. SOME COMMENTS THAT WE AGGREGATE AND SAY YOU KNOW WE SEE A PATTERN OF. ALL SHARE ONE WITH YOU THAT WE DID RECENTLY WITH A CLIENT WHERE WE SAY YOU KNOW SIX DIFFERENT WOMEN SAY THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT HEARD DURING MEETINGS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEIR LEADERS. THAT'S A TREND THAT WE NEED TO WATCH FOR. WE ARE COMING OUT WITH A NEW SOLUTION. A TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION THAT'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE THAT THE NEXT STEP. TO AGGREGATE ISSUES RELATED TO Q. IN A SO THAT WE CAN THEN SHARE THAT WITH EMPLOYERS TO AGAIN SAY HERE'S AREAS THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO BE CONCERNED WITH THAT WHETHER THAT MEANS INCREASED TRAINING IN THAT AREA WHETHER THAT MEANS PAYING ATTENTION. THEREARE DEFINITELY WAYS THAT AGAIN FOR ME IT'S THAT IDEA OF CREATING A POSITIVE VICIOUS CYCLE NOW YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDRESSING THINGS EARLY. THEY'RE GETTING TAKEN CARE OF THEY FEEL TRUSTS OF IT THEY CAN REPORT THOSE THINGS AND IN THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING SLIPS THROUGH THE CRACKS. THERE'S STILL COMFORTABLE REPORTING IT GETS INVESTIGATED FAIRLY GETS RESOLVED AND THE CYCLE CONTINUES. ADAM WARLOCK. BETTER. BUT MISTER FINO YOU YOU PROVIDED US WITH A. HAND OUT WITH SLIDES AND. HE FOUND ON SLIDE THREE OF PAGE ONE YOU REFERRED TO THE CALIFORNIA'S. PAMPHLET SEXUAL HARASSMENT. WHO PRINTS THAT? FAMILY AT THE AGE. AND. DO YOU HAVE A A COPY OF IT WITH YOU I DO NOT. WHERE WOULD ONE GET THAT? THE FE H. WITH THING I'D ADD ON THE WEBSITE. THAT WE RECEIVED THAT AT ALL AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. HAVE YOU RECEIVED THAT ALREADY OKAY. SO IN BUSINESS IT'S REQUIRED THAT EVERY NEW EMPLOYEE RECEIVE THAT. OKAY UPON HIGHER. BUT I'VE HIGH WILL LOOK THAT UP YOU ALSO ON PAGE THREE HAVE. A SLIDE. THE NUMBER SO TINY AND MIGHT BE IN EIGHT. ARE THERE OTHER CALIFORNIA PUBLICATIONS REFERRED TO. TWO THOUSAND FIVE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FROM. FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT SO THESE ARE NOT. DOCUMENTS THAT WERE REFERRING TO THESE OF THE LAWS WHEN THEY CAME INTO EFFECT. ON THE SLIDE QUE SO YOU'RE JUST TELLING THEM THERE'S THIS LAW THAT WE WERE THE FIRST SECTION THAT WE COVER IS THE BASIC FOUNDATION OF THE LAWS OF WHY WE HAVE. THIS CLASS WAY WE ARE HERE. YOU KNOW HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO COMPLY WITH SO WE HAVE TO COVER THAT IT'S MANDATED IN PART OF THE TRAINING. THE HACKER NO LIFE FIRST AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE WHO WHO THAT'S THE LAW YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE FACT. AND WOULD THAT LAW AND ALL THAT BE IN SIDE THIS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. PAMPHLET THAT COMES ON THE WEBSITE. YEAH SO THAT IF HE AGE PAMPHLET I MEAN. IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE HOW TO SUE YOUR HEART. SO IT'S THEIR RIGHTS IT'S A NOTICE OF THEIR RIGHTS AND IF THEY HAVE A COMPLAINT THAT THEY CAN COMPLAIN TO THE DEVIATION HOW THEY FILE A COMPLAINT. AND THEN YOU REFERRED TO THE PLAYING CARDS ON SLIDE HIM. SO WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I I HADN'T HEARD OF THAT BEFORE SO WHAT WE DO IS WE LITERALLY PASS OUT CARDS. EVERY PARTICIPANT HAS AT LEAST TWO OR THREE CARDS DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. AND WHEN YOUR CARD COMES UP ON THE SLIDE SO THEY DON'T SEE THAT THE WHOLE SLIDE THE BEGINNING WE ASK THE QUESTIONS AND AND IT BECOMES A VERY LIVELY AND AND KIND OF INTERACTIVE TRAINING PROCESS BUT THEY LEARN FROM IT. AND THEY SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES WHICH MAKES IT MORE REAL. PHILIP I HAVE THE KING OF HEARTS. IN MY HAND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL ON ME THE INNER. YOU ARE OKAY OKAY. SO JUST. YOU KNOW ONE. THING YEAHBUT NO I. I JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IT. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF CLIMATE SURVEYS? I THINK THEY'RE USEFUL. BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IN THE CONTEXT THE PERSONALITIES IN THE WORK ENVIRONMENT TO AND SURVEYS ARE JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY THINK SOMETIMES YOU WANTED THEM TO SAY SO IMPLICIT BIAS. IS A GOOD EXAMPLE WHEN WE ASK PEOPLE THINGS ALSO AND I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. AND THEN THEY DO IT. IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE NEVER GONNA DO THAT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS THEIR BIAS. IT'S REALLY UNCONSCIOUS AND IT'S BURIED VERY DEEPLY SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY. WOULD. NECESSARILY SAYING OH YEAH DOUBTS WOMEN BE SO WHEN YOU DO ALL THE DATA YES THE DATA IS HELPFUL BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PERSONALITY OF THAT. INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATION SO TO PATTY'S POINT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHO IT IS WHERE TRAINING. WHEN I DO SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING FOR HOT AGENCY THEIR CRAZY PEOPLE THERE FUND IN THEIR CREATIVE AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE TO HAVE RULES. IT'S REALLY JUST. THE OPPOSITE OF HOW THEY WORK. AND IF I GO INTO A BANK AND I DO IT THEY'RE ALL ABOUT RULES. SO THEN I ADDRESS IT DIFFERENTLY SO WE HAVE TO SPEAK DIFFERENTLY TO THE DIFFERENT. AUDIENCE IF YOU WILL THAT WE ARE TRAINING. THE DOUBT IS HELPFUL BECAUSE THEN WE KNOW IS THE TRAINING BEING EFFECTIVE. DO WE SEE A CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT WERE GETTING. ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY CHANGING THE CULTURE ARE WE HEARING LESS AND LESS ABOUT OWN MAN THIS BOX THAT I WORK FOR. AND YES I THINK IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU HAVE HERE BECAUSE OF THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF PEOPLE BECAUSE. OF LITTLE ELECTED VERSUS HIRED. TYPE OF OF STAFF THAT YOU HAVE SO. YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT TO THE DATA IS DEFINITELY HELPFUL FROM YOUR LEVEL BECAUSE. IT IT. GIVE SOME FOUNDATIONAL. REASONING FOR WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO BT IT CAN'T BE EXCLUSIVE OF ANYTHING ELSE. YOU DO IT AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN MAYBE ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER TO SEE IF THERE'S BEEN A. IMPROVED. CLIMATE CHANGE I GUESS WOULD BE THE. SO MOST OF OUR CLIENTS RETURNS BUT. BUT THAT HAVE THEY BEHAVED BETTER. MOST OUR CLIENTS ACTUALLY READ THEY RETAIN S. JUST TO DO THE HARASSMENT TRAINING AND THEN AFTER THE TRAINING IS DONE THEY RETAIN THIS OF CONSULTANTS. SO WE HAVE AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM TO HELP COACH AND COUNSEL THEM INTO THAT BETTER BEHAVIOR. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY KEY YOU CAN TRAIN ALL DAY LONG. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO FOLLOW THROUGH AND THAT MEANS THAT CULTURE HOUSE TO START BEING IN PLACE. THAT PEOPLE ARE ONCE THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED NOT AFRAID TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S NOT RIGHT PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT DON'T DO THAT. AND THAT THEIR PEERS AROUND THEM CAN CALL PEOPLE OUT AND IT'S SO IT HAS TO GO HAND IN HAND I DON'T SEE HOW IT WORKS IF IT DOESN'T. WHISPERS DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON CLIMATE SURVEYS. I'M LOOKING DIFFERENT AD I THINK THAT. THAT THAT IDEA OF IT BEING A SNAPSHOT AND KIND OF YOU KNOW YOUR BASELINE YOU START FROM THERE AND THEN SEEING IF THERE ARE. CHANGES THAT MAKE I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE. AS GOOD AS THEIR DEVELOPMENT SO IF THE QUESTIONS ARE GOOD YOU KNOW DATA IN GOOD DEAD IN WILL PRODUCE GOOD DEBT OUT. SO. YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR INTRO THAT YOU HAD DONE SO MANY INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE MAJORITY. OF VICTIMS WERE FEMALES. MAJORITY OF PERPETRATORS FOR MALES. I'M DO YOU HAVE OR HAVE YOU. BUILT A. A OUT A PORTFOLIO OF VICTIM CHARACTERISTICS. THAT THERE ARE SOME I THINK THERE IS A. AND NOT I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST BY TRADE BUT I FEEL LIKE I PLAY ONE ON TV. AND THERE ARE SOME. CHARACTERISTICS THAT I DID SEE BOTH END OF THE VICTIMS AND IN SOME CASES IN THE PERPETRATORS. YOU KNOW NOT TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN TELL YOU WITH WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL PRECISION. BUT THE ONE THAT I MENTIONED I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE WHICH IS THAT. DIFFERENCE IN POWER CREATING A DISCOMFORT. OF FEAR. A CONCERN OF YOU KNOW WHERE I MIGHT GET A REPORT IT NOW BE VIEWED AS A TROUBLEMAKER WHO'S GONNA BELIEVE ME ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS PERSON IS MORE POWERFUL THAN I AM. I DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES IT'S ALL GONNA BE HE SAID SHE SAID. SO ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT THAT COME TO MIND THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY ONLY ONE TYPE OF WOMAN BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE COMMON FEELINGS THAT THEY HAVE THAT MIGHT. MAKE THEM RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU VENTURE. AS A MEMBER DALY. THAT SHARE. THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I. ONE OF PAINT A PICTURE FOR YOU SO. I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. AND I'VE BEEN TO I WAS ELECTED SIXTEEN YEARS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT BEFORE AND SERVE. ATTENDED MANY. THE TRAININGS. MORE THAN I WANT TO THINK I HAD TO GO TO. BUT THE DYNAMICS OF THIS BUILDING AND. SO I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU KNOW I ONE OF FRAME THIS IN A WAY THAT. WE WILL MAKE SOME SENSE. INTO IN. BUT EARLIER DEBEERS HERE NOT RECENTLY BUT THERE WAS SO THERE'S LEGISLATION THAT COMES THROUGH HERE SO THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT. WAS PUTTING REGULATION ON THE ADULT FILM INDUSTRY. ON. PROTECTIONS. AND THERE WAS GRAPHIQUE VERY GRAPHIQUE INFORMATION THAT WAS FLOATING AROUND THIS BUILDING THESE CHAMBERS. IT'S WERE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE HAVE SITUATIONS COME TO US THAT ARE NOT NORMAL THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN AND BEEN. GOD. MY SEED COMPANY HOME RIGHT BECAUSE WE WOULD NOT BE DEBATING. WHAT ADULT FILMMAKERS SHOULD BE USING FOR PROTECTIONS? LIKEWISE PEOPLE IN PRISON WHAT THEY SHOULD BE. OBSERVERS SEVERAL BILLS GOING THROUGH IN IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. FOURTEEN I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS BUT ABOUT THE CURRENT THE EAST AND IT SO YOU HAVE STAFF THAT'S YOU'RE WORKING WITH THAT ANALYZING THESE BILLS. YOU HAVE MEMBERS FROM. TRYING TO GET THEIR BILLS PASSED. SO PUTS US IN A IN A DIFFICULT WORK ENVIRONMENT AND AND SOME CASES WHERE. THINGS YOU WOULDN'T I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T SEE EVEN IN YOUR LINE OF WORK FOR YOUR TRAINING EVERYDAY PHYSICISTS AB I MAYBE YOU HAVE. SO WHAT MY QUESTION IS. HOW DO YOU CHECK HOW DO YOU SET US UP FOR SUCCESS? IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT ISN'T THE NORM IT ISN'T SOME THINGS JUST AREN'T THE NORM HERE AND WE WORK WITH OUR. COLLEAGUES AND OUR STAFF IN. SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS YET TO. REVIEW AND TALK ABOUT BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE MAKE THE DECISION ON THOSE THOSE VOTES. THE OTHER THING DE THE SECOND QUESTION TWO IS THAT I WANTED TO ASK AND I'VE ASKED THIS ALMOST. EVERY PANEL THAT WE'VE HAD. THE LEGISLATURE. THERE'S BLOGS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT AND THEN PASSED IN THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T. BLUFF ALWAYS. THE. WE WE DON'T HERB BUT WHEN IT WE DON'T CONFORM TO LAWS WE PASS SOME EVEN EXAMPLE. WE DON'T PAY TIME AND A HALF WHEN WE WORK OVER EIGHT HOURS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. AND IT'S. BEEN SOMETHING THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY THOUGHT WAS. KIND OF CRAZY I HAVE TO ABIDE BY THESE LAWS A HOME BUT I DON'T HAVE TO ABIDE BY THESE LAWS HERE AND WE PASS LAWS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO. ABIDE BY WHICH MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. IF IT'S GOOD FOR. EVERYBODY ELSE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK SOMEONE SHOULD BE GOOD HERE AND THEN MAYBE SOME OF THE. PEOPLE WHO PASSED LAWS IN OUR STEAD HELPED SOMETIMES ARE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. SO. WHERE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT DID YOU THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD? HAVE TO CONFORM TO THE LAWS THAT WE PASS AND NUMBER TWO HOW WOULD YOU TRAIN. OR OF PUT INTO PRACTICE WHAT WE HAVE PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO COME THROUGH THERE JUST REALLY DIFFICULT. A. THANKS TO BEAVAN TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST PLACE. WELL TALK THE FIRST ONE THE ONE THAT THE SECOND ONE. WELL I KNOW THIS IS GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS BUT I BET YOU I'VE SEEN MORE GRAPHIC STUFF AND YOU HAVE. TWELVE HUNDRED WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS I HAVE VIDEOS THAT I HAVE TO WATCH THAT STILL BECAUSE MY EYES TO BURN JUST FROM THE MEMORY OF THAT. THE STUFF THAT GOES ON IN THE WORKPLACES IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE. SO I I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH AND AS FOR FOURTEEN YEARS I ACTUALLY OWNED AND OPERATED. A MALE CONSULTING COMPANY WHERE DID THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS WORK AND SO IN MY INTERVIEW PROCESS I ACTUALLY HAD TO SIT DOWN WITH. A POSSIBLE LEGAL ASSISTANCE POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS AND SAY. PART OF YOUR JOB IS GOING TO BE TO DO POINT SEARCHES FOUND PART OF YOUR JOB IS GOING TO BE TO THE WEBSITES THAT ARE VERY. ENOUGH DISTASTEFUL AND AND THAT MIGHT INSULT YOU. SO VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT I'VE ALSO I'M DELIGHTED TRAINING SESSIONS A LOT OF CONSULTING WITH OF WHERE THIS COULD THIS QUESTION COMES UP WHEN IT COMES TO MIND IS A. GENTLEMAN CAME UP TO ME AFTER TRAINING AND SAID I WORK FOR AN AMBULANCE COMPANY SO PART OF MY JOB IS TO BE EXPOSED TO REALLY GORY STUFF AND SO. BY NECESSITY OF MEN HAVE TO TALK ABOUT SEXUAL STUFF. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE QUITE MADE THAT CONNECTION BUT IT LEADS ME TO KIND OF THE TWO POINTS I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT. ONE IS THAT THERE IS A REALITY THAT THERE IS. A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF A JOB THAT NEEDS TO JUST BE ADDRESSED EARLY ON SO JUST LIKE I WOULD SAY TO MY POTENTIAL CANDIDATES YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXPOSED TO SOME UNSEEMLY STUFF YOU KNOW THAT'S PART OF THE JOB. I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU SET THOSE EXPECTATIONS. THE SECOND PART THOUGH I THINK IS THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT PART WHICH IS. YOUDON'T THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE CONFINES OF PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT SO WHEN THE GENTLEMAN SAID TO ME YOU KNOW WHEN I SORT OF PROSELYTISM Y. SAID I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND YOU WORK FOR AN AMBULANCE COMPANY POLY UP TO SEE REALLY GORY STUFF. BUT EXPLAINED TO ME HOW THAT GOES INTO SEXUAL CONTENT WELL YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE TO STRIP SOMEONE MAKE IT I MEAN WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THEIR BODY PARTS. HOW WAS THAT RELATED TO YOUR WORK AS YOU KNOW AN EMT WHAT'S NOT BUT I'M JUST SAYING IT HAPPENS WILL YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION IT'S NOT? AND SO IT'S TAKING THAT STEP FURTHER SO BEING EXPOSED TO YOU KNOW ISSUES IN THE ADULT INDUSTRY. FILM INDUSTRY MIGHT BE ONE THING SITTING AROUND AND LAUGHING ABOUT PICTURES IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING SO I THINK MAKING SURE THAT YOU MAINTAIN THAT. THEORY VERY CLEAR AND AND THICK LINE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS IS IMPORTANT. THE SECOND AND THIS IS CERTAINLY WHAT I DID IN MY OWN PRACTICE. IS BEING VERY RESPECTFUL AND SO I DIVIDED UP CERTAIN THINGS THAT WERE NECESSARY IN SOME THAT WEREN'T AND ONE VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND AS I HAD A. YOUNG LADY WHO CAME TO WORK WITH ME AS A LEGAL ASSISTANT WOULD VERY VERY DEEP RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS THAT MADE HER EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. SO I CARVED SOME THINGS OUT OF HER JOB DUTIES THAT WERE NOT COMPLETELY NECESSARY. THAT OTHER PEOPLE WERE HAPPY TO DO. JUST OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOU CAN STILL DO THE JOB YOU JUST WILL HAVE TO VISIT A PORN SITE OR YOU WON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME THINGS THAT. LIKE I SAID UNFORTUNATELY IN MY LINE OF WORK ARE AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE. LIKE A PART TO. WELL YOU'RE VOTERS WOULD PROBABLY SAY YES YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SAME LAWS WE DO. IS YOU KNOW THE THING IS THIS IT AS I TELL A LOT OF MY CLIENTS YOUR POLICIES HAVE TO MAKE SENSE. SO WHATEVER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES YOU PUT IN PLACE THEY HAVE TO MAKE SENSE FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO IN THE WORKPLACE YOU'RE IN. NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO HAVE THE SAME RULES IF YOU WILL. AND. AND I THINK THAT'S KEY IS THAT YOU HAVE TO STILL WORK WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF. WHAT IS NORMALLY DECENT? TO PATTY'S POINT. YEAH IF YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO CARVE THINGS OUT WHERE SOMEONE WHO IS UNCOMFORTABLE IN A SITUATION. CANNOT BE IN THAT SITUATION IT IN CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE GREAT. IF YOU DON'T. THEN YOU KNOW IT'S IT BECOMES A BIGGER PROBLEM AND THEN IS THAT PERSON. SOMEHOW. PUSHED OFF TO A DIFFERENT POSITION SOMEWHERE ELSE OR LET GO WELCOME ALTOGETHER. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE DECIDED AND I AGREE WITH WHAT PATTY SAID. YOU CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AND YOU CAN ANALYZE THINGS ARE UNPLEASANT. WITHOUT MAKING IT THE JOKE OF THE DAY. AND STARTING TO MAKE THOSE THE UNCOMFORTABLE REMARKS AFTERWARDS. AND THAT'S WHERE CROSSES THE LINE IF IT'S BUSINESS ITS BUSINESS. I'VE SEEN MY FAIR SHARE OF HORRID THINGS IN HARASSMENT INVESTIGATIONS AND THEY'RE NOT PLEASANT AND I'VE WATCHED VIDEOS WHERE SOMEONE THAT HE WAS INCREDIBLY IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL AT ANOTHER COMPANY. ANY CENTER INAPPROPRIATE VIDEOS AND WE GOT TO WATCH HIM FOR LIKE THE FIRST TWENTY SECONDS I DIDN'T NEED TO SEE MORE. BUT IF THE EXTENSION OF THAT IS TO MAKE OUR HEARTS ABOUT HIS BODY PARTS OR TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT. HIS AMOROUS INTENTIONS WITH HER THAT'S WHERE THE LINE IS CROSSED. THAT'S WHERE YOU CREATE A CULTURE OF THIS IS BUSINESS AND WE STOPPED THERE. BOB APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS I I WAS MORE HEADING TOWARDS I GET THAT WE SHOULD CARVE OUT AND WE WERE TO PROTECT. ANYBODY WHO. IS NOT COMFORTABLE IN ANY SITUATION. BUT WHAT I'M ASKING YOU AT SOME POINT THIS COMMITTEES GONNA GIVE SUGGESTIONS TO. THE REST OF THE THAT BOTH HOUSES AND OF IT WILL COME UP WITH SOME GOOD POLICY. IN. CRAFTING TRAINING IS WHAT I MATT MY POINT WAS ON THAT IS THERE. SUITED NO THE X. DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES A COME FORWARD HERE IS A IS KIND LIKE THE AIMLESS SIXTEEN SITUATION WE HAVE WE'RE GOING TO SEE LEGISLATION THAT IS. GIVE ME A CUP OF OR SOME. BUT WE NEED TO BUILD A TRAIN THEM BEFORE WE GET TO THAT PROCESS THAT HE WOULD LEGISLATION GIVES YOU THAT'S. BUT YOU DON'T WORK OUT WITH YOU NEED A LOT SOMEBODY KNOW THAT THIS IS GONNA BE A COUPLE OF AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT MORE I WAS HEADING IS THAT CAN WE PUT IT. IT TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK FOR THIS THIS LINE OF WORK DEAD ATTACKS THE. VICTIMS AND AND THE FOLKS THAT SO WE DON'T GET IN THAT POSITION WHICH IN UP FRONT. WHAT TECHNIQUE THAT THAT I HAVE FOUND TO BE REALLY EFFECTIVE ON AN ISSUE THAT SPECIFIC? IS TO PRESENT TO EXTREME. EXAMPLES THAT I THINK REALLY HIGHLIGHT. THE ULTIMATE POINT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SOLVE I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THAT'S NOT EXACTLY RELATED TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I GET ASKED A LOT PARTICULAR BY MEN. ABOUT COMPLIMENTS YOU KNOW CAN I EVER GIVE A COMPLIMENT TO SOMEONE SO HERE'S HOW I TRAIN ON THAT I SAY OKAY LISTEN TO TWO EXAMPLES OF ANY GIVE YOU. PATTY BICU WHO LOOKS REALLY NICE TODAY TO DID YOU GET A CUT. THAT'S ONE. WELL PATTI THAT DRESS LOOKS AWESOME ON YOU REALLY SHOWS OFF HER CURVES. THEY'RE BOTH COMPLIMENTS. ONE IS OKAY ONE ISN'T. SO SIMILARLY I THINK THAT THERE'S WAYS THAT YOU CAN SAY. LOOK IN TRAINING THEY'RE GONNA BE SOME TOPICS THAT ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARILY INVOLVING. SEXUAL. ACTIVITIES. THAT'S ONE SCENARIO. THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE COOL. CHECK OUT THIS VIDEO WAY HEY COME OVER HERE LET'S WATCH IT. I'VE FOUND THAT DOING THAT IN TRAINING KIND O DOING BOTH EXTREMES MAKES PEOPLE GO. ALL I GET IT. CUT OUT. AND DEBATE. THANK YOU HOME THANK YOU BOTH AND YOU HAVE A YOU BOTH HAVE VERY IMPRESSIVE RESUMES. I GUESS WHERE I AM WITH SO WHERE WAS BEEN THROUGH OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IS THAT. STILL VERY FRUSTRATING TO KNOW WHAT DIRECTION WE'RE GONNA TAKE AS A COMEDIAN. HEARING OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED HERE WITH THEM SO THAT WE CAN CRAFT A POLICY. OUR POLICY STARTED WITH ZERO TOLERANCE NOBODY BASICALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT IS THAT MEAN YOU KNOW IF YOU MAKE A. COMMENT CHAU DISLIKE YOU LOOK GREAT IN THAT DRESSING YOUR CURVES IS ABOUT SOMETHING BETWEEN PEERS IN THE SAME OFFICE. WHERE'S THAT FROM A SUPERVISOR TO A SUBORDINATE IT'S A DIFFERENT SITUATION. SO THE SUPERVISOR HAS TO REPORT YOU REPORT TO YOUR SUPERVISOR YOU KNOW JIM SAID THAT TO ME AND I'M OFFENDED THEN THE SUPERVISOR HAVE SAY SOMETHING TO JIM DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN. BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF REPORTING AND FOR AN INVESTIGATION. BUT IF IT'S A SUPERVISOR WHO SAYS IT TO APPEAR IN THAT COMES ACROSS STATUS. YOU NO HARASSMENT BECAUSE THE SUPERIOR TO THE SUBORDINATE WHO STARTING TO BE INTIMIDATING AND SHE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE TO REPORT. MY SUPERVISORS MAKING INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS IN. SO THAT'S THE DILEMMA I SEE FOR ALL OF US IS DETERMINING THAT CONTINUUM. SO LOOKING AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE OVER THE YEARS YOU'VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE. SHARE WITH US. WHERE YOU BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE BASED ON THE DATA YOU'RE COLLECTING AND THAT WHAT YOU'RE? SHARING WITH US IS WORKING SOME WAY SOMEHOW. WITH. ODD THAT THE COMPANY CP STILL CONSULT WITH YOU STARTED THE THE CART BROUGHT YOU IN BECAUSE THERE WERE ISSUES ARE THEY WANTED TO AVOID ISSUES. AND YOU PROVIDED THIS TRAINING BOTH OF YOU IN YOUR SEPARATE. DEMANDS AND SOMETHING'S WORKING IN SOMETHING ISN'T BASED ON THE FEEDBACK THAT YOU GOT WITH THERE'S DATA COLLECTION. OR JUST CONTINUING IN YOUR ROLE AS A CONSULTANT. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO MOVE THIS PLACE SOMEWHERE IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO BECAUSE THERE'S MANY INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE STILL ON GOING. AND I'M NOT SURE HUNTING GETTING THERE IN TERMS OF TELLING. THE PEOPLE THAT SENT ME INTO THIS COMMITTEE HERE'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR TWENTY YEARS I'VE HAD. THIS TRAINING AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL IS A STATE OFFICIAL IN THE ASSEMBLY IN AND NOW HERE IN THE SENATE. WHAT IF I GAS THROUGH DISTURBING US I THINK THE CULTURE OUTSIDE? IN THE. SOCIETY HAS CHANGED AND WE HAVE MORE DON'T ASK PERMISSION ASK FORGIVENESS IN WAIT TILL YOU'RE CAUGHT. BECAUSE OF THAT SEEMS TO BE THE UNDERPINNING WE ARE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT PERPETRATORS HERE. WHO HAVE SAT THROUGH ALL OF THIS WITH US OVER THE YEARS AND STILL THINK A FULL CAVES TAKE THOSE BABY STEPS? I THOUGHT IN DOING SOMETHING THAT BASICALLY STARTS TO GET TO THE POINT OF PER. OVER THE LINE A CRIMINAL SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND. IN YOUR TRAINING. WHAT DO WE NEED TO TAKE OUT OF THESE? AND USE IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN COMPANIES COLLEGE YOU FORWARD. TO HELP THEM. THEY'RE ALL A BIG ASK BUT HE. HOOKED IN JUST A FEW MONTHS OR WEEKS WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKED BACK. NO QUESTION WELL I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS. YEAH. THE ISSUE OF OF THAT HARASSMENT. IN ANY FORM. IS SYSTEMIC IN YOUR WORKPLACE WOULD HAVE TO START WITH YOUR CULTURE. IT HOUSE TO BE WHERE PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTING THAT BEHAVIOR AT ALL LEVELS. SO IN THE ORGANIZATIONS I WORK WITH THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALIZADA OF WE COME IN THERE FROM A VERY LEGALISTIC THOU SHALT NOT TYPE OF TRAINING. NO ONE'S LISTENING AND THEY DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE ALL EXPERIENCE THEY GO TO THE TO OUR TRAINING THEY GO OUT THEY GO SH. I COULD'VE BEEN DOING EMAIL YOU KNOW AND THEY DON'T THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT AFTER THE FACT. WHEN WE APPROACH IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY OF SAYING LOOK WE GET IT YOU'RE HUMAN. BUT SO ARE THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU AND YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THEIR SPACE IF WE DON'T. GO IN AND SAY WE'RE DOING HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING WE GO IN AND SAY WE'RE DOING RESPECT IN THE WORKPLACE TRAINING. AND IT CHANGES THE MIND SET FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. AND WE TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THE YOU BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS. AND. IT COMES DOWN TO THIS. NOW THE SENIOR MANAGERS CEOS EXECUTIVES ARE TAKING THIS MORE SERIOUSLY AND UNFORTUNATELY IT DID HAVE TO HAPPEN WITH ALL THE NEWS THAT WE'VE SEEN LATELY THAT NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO. TAKE NOTICE. THEY HAD TO COME TO THAT FOR THEM TO MAKE THE CHANGE BECAUSE UNTIL THEY MAKE THE CHANGE. NOBODY ELSE IN THEIR ORGANIZATION. SO. FOR YOUR LEVEL YOU THAT YOUR LEADERS HAVE TO TAKE THAT CHANGE THE INTERNS. YOU'RE RIGHT IF AN INTERN SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ANOTHER INTERN IT'S REALLY NOT THE SAME THING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE POWER OVER EACH OTHER. BUT THAT SENATOR FOR THAT IS HOW WE PERSON ABSOLUTELY CAN DESTROY THEIR CAREER. AND IT'S THE SAME IN THE WORKPLACE IF I'M A RECEPTIONIST AND THE CEO SAID SOMETHING. AND INAPPROPRIATE TO ME. YEAH I'M PROBABLY GONNA SAY QUIET BECAUSE I'M JUST STARTING IN THE WORKPLACE AND I NEED A JOB. AND THAT'S JUST DOES THE FACTS BUT I THINK WE'RE SEEING A SEA CHANGE NOW BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING IN THE NEWS AND AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT IT HAD TO HAPPEN THAT WAY. BUT IF THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK TO TO MAKE SOCIETY CHANGE. YEAH AND I THINK A SOCIETY CHANGES WE'RE GONNA HOLD EVERYBODY ELSE MARK COUNTABLE. IF HAVE IN THE COMPANY'S YOU WORK WITH IS THE FEEDBACK THAT WOULD THE TRAINING YOU GIVEN. HAVE HELPED DRAMATICALLY. IT'S HOPE FROM THE FOR A LOT OF THE FEEDBACK THAT I GET FROM MY CLIENTS IS. FIRST OF ALL THAT'S THE BEST TRAINING THEY'VE EVER HAD THAT'S NOT ABOUT ME THEY JUST LIKE THE APPROACH BETTER THAT IT'S NOT. HARSH. AND THE SECOND PIECE IS. THAT WE'RE NOT POINTING FINGERS AT ANYBODY NOPE WE DON'T. APPROACH AT THE YOUR HORRIBLE PERSON HOW DARE YOU. OF ALL THAT COULD BE SOME OUT THERE BUT. WE APPROACH IT FROM A SENSE OF LUCK YOU NEED TO BE AWARE NEED TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND HERE'S WHY HERE'S HOW IT HELPS YOUR PRODUCTIVITY IN YOUR. BOTTOM LINE IN YOUR COMPANY AND. YOU KNOW IT. NOBODY EVER WANTS TO COME TO WORK. AND FEEL LIKE OH MY GOD I HAVE TO WORK WITH THAT PERSON AGAIN TODAY. AND NO COMPANY WANTS TO LOSE THEIR BEST TALENT BECAUSE THIS PERVASIVE IN THEIR ORGANIZATION. BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS PEOPLE WILL LEAVE. SO YOU KNOW I'VE DONE I'M SURE PATTY IS IN THE SAME THING WE'VE SEEN MANY PEOPLE LOSE GREAT TALENT. BECAUSE THAT ONE PERSON WHO THEY JUST COULDN'T DO WITHOUT. IS STILL THERE AND SO THEY LOSE TWENTY FIVE OF THEIR BEST PEOPLE. AND EVENTUALLY PEOPLE GO ON ALL THE SOCIAL MEDIA THEY SAY DON'T WORK FOR THAT COMPANY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE KATHY WORKS AND SHE'S A HORRIBLE BOSS. AND HERE'S WHAT SHE DOES. AND THAT IS IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE AND THAT COULD BE IN YOUR ORGANIZATION TO DON'T WORK FOR THAT SENATOR. AND HERE'S WHY. SO I'VE GOTTEN MUCH MORE TO SAY ON TRAINING EXCEPT. TO REITERATE THE POINT THE TRAINING HAS TO BE A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. NOT THE PUZZLE ITSELF AND SO IT IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE IF IT'S TODD. A SMALL PART OF A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN SO WITH THAT IN MIND VERY VISUAL AND SO FOR ME ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS. HELPFUL TO VISUALIZE WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT AN OVERHAUL. IS PRE REPORT AND POST REPORT. SO PREBOR PORT TO ME IS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. AS THE STATISTICS THAT I SHARED SHOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMPLAINTS START EVERITT REPORTED THEY NEVER GET TO A POINT WHERE WE WERE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY. NOW IN SOME CASES THAT'S OKAY IT'S BECAUSE. THAT WE ARE HOPEFULLY EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS ON THE ROAD AND THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT. DOTS WERE TOOLS LIKE A WORKPLACE COLOR SPECTRUM THAT'S FOR TOOLS LIKE COMMUNICATION SKILLS I THINK IT REALLY GOAL LONG WAY TOWARDS HELPING TO DIFFUSE SITUATIONS VERY EARLY. SO THERE ARE WAYS THAT I THINK. YOU CAN VERY EFFECTIVELY CREATE A CULTURE OF TRUTH TELLING NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF TELLING THE TRUTH IN A FORMAL REPORT. BUT BEING TRUTHFUL WITH EACH OTHER BEING SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER AND HAVING A CULTURE WHERE NOT ONLY THE VICTIM SPEAKS UP BUT THE. BYSTANDER SPEAK UP AND AND THEN A KEY COMPONENT IS WHERE THE PERSON ACCUSED IS MATURE ENOUGH TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT. I'M SORRY THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT AND I'M GONNA LEARN FROM IT. SO THAT'S SORT OF THE PRE REPORT THE POST REPORT YOU KNOW I'VE COME UP WITH A REALLY SIMPLE THREE STEP PROCESS OF YOU DO RECEIVE A REPORT. YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY YOU INVESTIGATE IT WELL AND YOU FIX THE PROBLEM. I'VE SEEN TO MANY INSTANCES WHERE SOMEBODY COMES TO. THAT THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY IF YOU WILL AND SAYS YOU KNOW I HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT. AND THE REACTION IS WELL THAT'S JUST BOB YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST WHAT BOB IS. SO TAKING IT SERIOUSLY OF THE VERY FIRST STEP THE NEXT IS PERFORMING A REALLY THOROUGH AND FAIR INVESTIGATION. BUT WHERE I SEE. THE BIGGEST ISSUES IS ON THE THIRD STEP WHICH IS FIXING IT. SO THE HIGH VALUE EMPLOYEE ISSUE COMES AND A VERY PRACTICAL TOOL THAT I'VE AND PROVIDE ITS MIKE TWO THINGS THAT PROVIDE TO MY CLIENTS ONE IS. PUT THE BEHAVIOR BEFORE YOU EVEN START THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOUR SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE. IN A RANGE SO IF IT'S ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN IS THE MISCONDUCT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A ONE OR TWO. RISEN IN EIGHT OR NINE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY GOING TO INFORM WHAT IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S POSSIBLY A TERMINATION INTERMINABLE OFFENSE. OR ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TWO INTERNS WHO BAPTISM YOU DO NOTHING BUT IT MEANS THAT YOUR ULTIMATE REMEDY IS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT THING THAN IF THE BEHAVIOR IS MUCH MORE CREATURES. TAKE OTHER FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION IS THIS THE FIRST TIME OR IS IT THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT THIS PERSON HAS ENGAGED IN THIS TYPE OF CONDUCT. AND ALL THAT WHAT I THE FREEZE THAT I THAT I CLEAN FOR MY CLIENTS AS I WOULD GIVE THEM WHEN I CALLED MYSELF WHICH ABILITY SCALE. SO ARE BY SALVAGEABLE HE READING OUT SO AFTER I SPOKE TO THE PERSON ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT. I WOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD READ ON IS THIS PERSON UNDERSTANDING. THE SEVERITY OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT THEY ENGAGE CENTER THEY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT ARE THE STUFF AWARE ENOUGH. TO REALLY BE WILLING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES UP OF COURSE IN THE IN THE CASES WHERE I FOUND THAT THERE WAS SOME LEVEL OF MISCONDUCT. SO THAT'S THE PART WHERE I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE. METICULOUS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS A RANGE AND A PERSON WHO IS YOU KNOW ACCUSED EVER FOUND TO ENGAGE IN MISCONDUCT THAT'S A ONE. IS NOT GONNA RECEIVE A DISCIPLINARY MEASURE THAT'S A TEN. AND CONVERSELY SOMEONE WHO IS FOUND TO ENGAGE AN EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR SHOULDN'T GET A ONE. THE FINAL THING I'LL SAY ON THAT WHERE I THINK ENTITIES IN GENERAL WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE. I REALLY HAVE BEEN HIS UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE THIS IDEA THAT YOU EITHER DO NOTHING. OR YOU FIRE SOMEONE. THERE A MILLION THINGS IN BETWEEN THAT CAN BE DONE THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND PART OF THAT SALVAGEABLE THE READING THAT I WOULD GIVE TO MY CLIENTS WOULD BE. HERE'S WHAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT FOR A DURING MY INTERVIEW HE IS MOTIVATED ALMOST SOLELY BY PRESTIGE AND MONEY. AND SO YOU STANDING UP TO ONE HOUR TRAINING SESSION IS GOING TO DO NOTHING. YOU DEMOTING HIM. YOU TAKING HIS BONUS AWAY YOU TAKING AWAY A CHAIRMANSHIP BORROWER OR SOME OTHER IMPORTANT POSITION NOW THAT'S GOING TO SEND A MESSAGE. AND SO I THINK REALLY BEING METICULOUS ABOUT HOW IT IS THAT WE APPROACH NOT JUST. THE RECEIVING OF COMPLAINTS IN THE INVESTIGATING OF COMPLAINTS BUT RESOLVING THEM. THE KEY THAT HELPS A LOT IN TERMS OF THE. THE CONTINUE OF CONSEQUENCE BRITAIN WHETHER THAT STARTS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE KNOWING THAT YOU IF YOU ARE THE PERPETRATOR. YOU KNOW HERE'S HERE'S THE AYE DASHBOARD MOTHER TO SPEAK OF THANK YOU. THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL. SENATOR MITCHELL DIDN'T. GLAD I MADE IT BACK BUT TO HEAR SENATOR BATES QUESTION WITH REGARD TO CULTURE. AND I IN HEARING YOU ARTICULATE YOUR QUESTION. SENATOR BATES SAID IT I REALIZED THAT. LONELY START THIS PROCESS. I HAD A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT I THOUGHT THE INSTITUTION SHOULD DO. THROUGH THE HEARING PROCESS AS FAR AYE THEN MOVED TO A PLACE OF OVERWHELM BASED ON ALL THE INFORMATION WE ARE RECEIVING. AND I FEEL THAT I'VE COME FULL CIRCLE. TO A PLACE WHERE. IF WE. THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO HAVE THE COLLECTIVE COURAGE TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE JOINT RULES. ACKNOWLEDGING A NEED FOR CULTURE CHANGE THAT WE HAVE TO PROPOSED RADICAL CHANGE. AND IN HEARING THE EXAMPLES TODAY ABOUT TRAINING THAT WORKS. AND HOW DIFFERENT IT IS FROM THE TRAINING WE EXPERIENCE. I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT IF WE. LOOK AT CULTURE LOOK AT TRAINING. AND REALLY HAVE A HOLISTIC VIEW OF OF IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT BUT WE HAVE LEARNED IN THESE FIVE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT. IF WE CHOOSE TO DO SOME DIFFERENT IT WILL BE ON US NOT BECAUSE THE MESSAGES WE SEEMED WERE NOT CONSISTENT. IN TERMS OF WHAT RESEARCH AND WHAT PRACTICE. IS TELLING US WHAT WORK AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO US TO REALLY DECIDE TO RECOMMEND RADICAL CHANGE. YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE WITH THE TWO NAMES AT THE WATER COOLER. JANE IN FRED WITHOUT ALL THIS WHOEVER THIS YOU KNOW THE REAL A THING THAT OFTEN BECAUSE THEY WERE THE REAL NAMES SUITED YOU SEVEN I REMEMBER IT LIKE. THE RIDICULOUSLY LAME EXAMPLE IN OUR TRAINING AND IT'S NOT GERMANE TO WHAT WE DO. AND AND WHILE WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN THESE HEARINGS TALK ABOUT YOU WILL WERE DIFFERENT BLOW OVER DIFFERENT. AND WE ARE AND THEREFORE OUR TRAINING SHOULD REFLECT THAT NOW WE HAVE THE POWER THROUGH TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SOUGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE IT. TOOK ME ON MY FULL CIRCLE LIKE WE HAVE TO STEP UP IF WE WANT MEASURABLE CHANGE IN OUR CULTURE THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. PUSH THE ENVELOPE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN REALLY. MISS PEREIRA'S BOMBING. TELL ME WHAT MICRO LEARNING IS I'VE I HAVE AN ASSUMPTION BUT OUT OF ONE ASSUME FLOPPY THROUGH DEFINE THAT FOR ME. YOU REFERENCE THAT MY YOUR SLIDES YEAH IT IT'S JUST WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE SO YOU'VE GOT SORT OF YOUR FORMAL TRAINING WHICH. CAN BE DONE IN IN ONE SITTING OR AS WAS SUGGESTED EARLIER COULD BE DONE YOU KNOW THAT THE TWO HOUR LET'S SAY REQUIRE TRAINING. THE MICRO LEARNING. BURSTS WE CALL THEM IS IT A WAY OF STRENGTHENING OF REINFORCING OF GIVING A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW SO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF THE ACTUAL EXAMPLES SO WE HAVE OUR OUR HARASSMENT TRAINING PERMITTING WORKPLACE HARASSMENT TRAINING WE HAVE OUR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING WE HAVE THAT. SUITE OF FIVE ESSENTIALS THAT I FOR A REFERENCE TO A NUMBER OF TIMES BUT THEN WE HAVE THESE MICRO LEARNING LESSONS THAT ARE. THE VIDEOS THAT I REFERENCED EARLIER SO IT'S A VIDEO ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE A BYSTANDER AND IT COMES NOT JUST WITH A VIDEO BUT WITH THE MANY LEARNING LESSON THAT SAYS. HERE WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN INTERVENE MAYBE A COUPLE OF POLLING QUESTIONS AND ASK YOU ABOUT IT. ANOTHER ONE THAT I'VE REFERENCED ALREADY IS A GUIDE THAT I HAVE FOUR PEOPLE WERE TARGETS AND SO IN ADDITION TO THE VIDEO THERE'S ACTUALLY HAND OUT THAT SAYS. HERE'S THREE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY TO SOMEBODY IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A POSITION. WHERE YOU'RE BEING EXPOSED TO SOME TYPE OF BEHAVIOR ABOUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE OFTENTIMES JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO SAY IT? AND SO THIS IS A SCRIPT THAT SAYS IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE DEALING WITH IT YOURSELF HERE SOME EXAMPLES OF THE WAYS YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT. IF YOU'RE NOT AND YOU GO TO HR HERE'S A SCRIPT FOR WHAT TO SAY OR NOT SAY SO THAT'S ANOTHER MICRO LEARNING LESSON IS A WAY. OF AGAIN JUST REINFORCING WHAT'S BEEN DONE SO AT LEAST FROM OUR VIEW THOUGH THEY HAVE TO BE. RELEVANT AND AGAIN ALL SORT OF POINT TO NOT ONLY WORKPLACE CULTURE BUT. THESE FIVE LESSONS TO TO COINCIDE WITH AND REALLY REINFORCE THOSE THINGS. THAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS. IT IT WAS BUT I WANT TO BE SURE. BECAUSE AS I SHARED WITH WITH MADAM CHAIR AS I'M LISTENING TO YOU AND HEARING. ABOUT ABOUT FRAMING. THAT YOU DON'T FRAME AS IF YOU'RE COMING TO HEAR THAT YOU KNOW TO LEARN THE LAW. AND RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE KIND OF. ORGANICS THE WRONG WORD BUT BUT BOTH CAUCUSES IN BOTH HOUSES HAVE. WEEKLY CAUCUSES. IT'S A PART OF OUR CULTURE OUR EXISTING CULTURE WHERE WE GO WITH MEMBERS TO RECEIVE INFORMATION LEARN NEW INFORMATION EXCHANGE INFORMATION. AND SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE MICRO LEARNING PIECE WAS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. IN ADDITION TO OUR ONCE A YEAR ARE MANDATED WE CAN USE THESE EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES. ONCE A MONTH ONCE EVERY OTHER MONTH. TWO HAVE THE MICRO LEARNING EXPERIENCE AROUND CULTURE. THAT IT'S NOT A SEPARATE SCHEDULE TIME WHERE WE. YOU KNOW IT IF CAUCUSES ON EVERYONE'S CALENDAR IN BOTH HOUSES EVERY WEEK. AND SO FIGURED OUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN INTEGRATE. LEARNING. NEW WAYS OF THINKING INTO OUR EXISTING KIND OF PATTERN AND PRACTICE. MAY BE HELPFUL SLEPT WELL AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT WHAT MICHAEL LEARNING WHAT TO SEE IF THAT MADE SENSE AND IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE THING BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A FABULOUS IDEA. ANOTHER. VERY PRACTICAL WAY IN WHICH I FOUND. THIS THIS WORKS WELL AND I CERTAINLY INCORPORATED INTO MY MY TRAINING IS USING EITHER REAL LIFE EXAMPLES OR IN MY CASE I CAN USE REAL LIFE EXAMPLES BECAUSE I'VE DONE SO MANY INVESTIGATIONS AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THEY'RE FROM. BUT I'LL GIVE YOU REALLY QUICK ONE I HAVE A AN INVESTIGATION I CONDUCTED WHERE A SUPERVISOR SAID TO HIS YOUNG AS. ASSISTANT HEY MY FLIES OPEN WHAT YOU TELL ME MY FLY WAS OPEN HE SAID IT TWICE. I STOPPED THERE AND I GET A WILL SAY TO THE PEOPLE ON TRAIN WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT. AND ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS IS IT REALLY STARTS A CONVERSATION WHICH IS REALLY THE MAIN POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THIS MICRO LEARNING LESSON IS IT STARTS PEOPLE IN A VERY COMFORTABLE WAY TALKING ABOUT IT. PEERS Y. THIS PARTICULAR HYPOTHETIC OR NOT HYPOTHETICAL FACT PATTERN IS IS REALLY INTERESTING. WHAT I SAY I STOP THERE AND GET MORE FACTS AND I SAY WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IS THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE RISING TO UP MORE THAN JUST AN APPROPRIATE? IT'S PRETTY UNIVERSAL THAT WOMEN WILL SAY TO ME THAT'S GROSS AND I DON'T WANT MY BOSS TELLING ME TO YOU KNOW LOOK AT THAT PART OF HIS BODY. AND I'VE HAD A SMALL PERCENTAGE BUT A PERCENTAGE OF MEN WHO WILL SAY TO ME WELL BEFORE I CAN TELL YOU IT'S APPROPRIATE OR NOT. I NEED TO KNOW IF HIS FLIGHT WAS REALLY DOWN. BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T DOWN THEN HE'S A CREEP BUT IT WAS DOWN THEN MAYBE WAS JUST LEGITIMATELY TRYING TO I'VE NEVER HAD A WOMAN SAY THAT TO ME. SO I USE THIS HYPOTHETICAL ON WHERE THE STOCK PATTERN ON PURPOSE TO REALLY START HIGHLIGHTING THAT YOU KNOW WE SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY. AND SO IT IT REALLY. NOW IS A ROBUST AND HONEST DISCUSSION AGAIN NOT BLAMING NOT SAYING YOU'RE A BAD GUY YOU'RE A GOOD GUY BUT STARTING THIS CONVERSATION I THEN MOVE ON TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FACTS AND WITHOUT. GOING INTO THE INTO IT TOO DEEPLY IT TURNS OUT THAT THE THE GENTLEMAN WHO ENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIOR WAS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OLDER THAN THE YOUNG LADY AND TALKED CONSTANTLY. ABOUT HOW HIS PREFERRED DEMOGRAPHIC WAS EXACTLY THIS YOUNG LADY AND SO IT PUTS THINGS IN CONTEXT NOW SUDDENLY IT'S NOT JUST HIM SAYING OF MY FLY OPEN. IT IS HER SAYING. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S HITTING ON ME BUT I SURE KNOW THAT OUR PHONE TWO WAS DEMOGRAPHIC BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE TALKS ALL THE TIME NOT ABOUT SEX. BUT ABOUT LIKING WOMEN MY AGE SO MAYBE MAYBE HE'S OUT THERE FISHING FOR IT. AND NOW SUDDENLY THE PEOPLE IN THE TRAINING SESSION OR LIKE ALL THAT'S ALL DIFFERENT ONCE YOU PUT IT INTO CONTEXT SO THAT'S ANOTHER MICHAEL LEARNING LESSON IT'S A TEN MINUTE CONVERSATION. BUT IT OPENS UP A DISCUSSION THAT REALLY IN A WAY THAT'S NOT BLAMING IN A WAY THAT'S NOT. DEFENSIVE. PEOPLE WALK OUT OF THERE SAYING HE I GUESS MAYBE I SEE THE WORLD A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND CONTEXT REALLY MATTERS. AND IT DOES MATTER AND AND THE EXAMPLES YOU'VE GIVEN LET US KNOW THAT SO MUCH OF OUR LIVES ARE IN THE GRAY AREA. AS OPPOSED TO THE REALLY KIND OF SIMPLISTIC CAN I FILL GIVE COPS. DOUBLE THE COMPLIMENTS WERE PERFECT BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT AS MY FATHER WOULD SAY STEVIE WONDER COULD SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THOSE TO HOW THEY WERE DIFFERENT. FOR ME MADAM CHAIR. IN THE HANDOUT YOU SHARE WITH US YOU TALKED ABOUT. BUT. A ON PAGE. FOUR OF THE HANDOUTS THAT THREE SLIDES ON RETALIATION. TALL MEN AND WE'VE HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATION PREVIOUS HEARINGS ARE RETALIATION. AND. THE THIRD SLIDE. YOU SAY HOW CAN WE PREVENT RETALIATION AND YOUR LAST BULLET THIS DOCUMENT DOCUMENT DOCUMENT. CAN YOU EXPAND UPON THAT BELIEF. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE RETALIATION AND DISLIKE PARTICULARLY THAT THE END ARE YOU ASKING THAT SPECIFICALLY THAT LINE DOCUMENT DOCUMENT ON. JUSTICE SIX BY IF LONG EACH OUR MANTRA THAT WE ARE IS A DOCUMENTED RIGHT RIGHT. BUT YEAH THERE THERE IS A. PART WHERE WE'D DOCUMENT THESE THINGS EVEN IF THEY'RE JUST. KIND OF MAYBE NOT A FULL HARASSMENT NOT REALLY SOMETHING PERVASIVE VIA. BUT WE DOCUMENTED IN THE SENSE THAT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN ARE WE NOW SEEING A PATTERN. IF THIS PERSON IN NO IS AS PRICE THAT EARLIER TWENTY ONE TIMES IS DOING THIS THAT'S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN THE PERSON WHO'S DONE IT ONCE. AND SO WHEN WE'RE GOING BACK AND WE'RE SAYING WELL YOU KNOW YEAH HE'S A KEY EMPLOYEES BUT HE DOES THIS EVERY MONDAY. YOU KNOW WHEN THE STAFF COMES IN WITH YOU KNOW COFFEE OR WHATEVER. AND THE DOCUMENTATION FOR RETALIATION IS. LOOK WE'VE WARNED YOU RETALIATION IS NOT ACCEPTABLE SO IF WE HAVE DONE AN INVESTIGATION OR EVEN IF WE'VE JUST HAD THAT INITIAL CONVERSATION SAYING LOOK YOUR YOUR COMMENTS WERE INAPPROPRIATE. AND A BRIGHT THEY WERE DEPRECIATED SO YOU KNOW WERE COUNSELING YOU NOW TO PLEASE STOP THAT. AND YOU CANNOT GO BACK INTO THAT. AREA AND NOW HARASS THE PERSON WHO JUST REPORTED THIS. NO BECAUSE THEY FELT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH YOUR WORDS. THAT'S WHY WE DOCUMENT SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A RECORD OF THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN THE WORKPLACE. THESE THINGS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME AND IF THEY'RE NOT DOCUMENTED IT'S YOUR WORD AGAINST THEIRS. AND SO THAT'S IN TERMS OF THE HR PROFESSIONALS ROLE COULD YOU TALK ABOUT EXPECTATIONS AROUND. PRETTY SUPERVISORS AND OTHERS DOCUMENT I HAD AN HR. PER PROFESSIONAL WHO TAUGHT ME HOW TO WRITE MEMOS TO FILE A AS A YOUNG SUPERVISOR. THAT THAT WAR YOU KNOW I DIDN'T RECEIVE THEM AS OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION BUT IF I SAW A PATTERN THAT I THEN DECIDED I NEED TO GO TO HR. IKE IT DIDN'T REFRESH MY OWN MEMORY TERMS OF DETAILS DATE SPECIFICS IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW THE LITTLE PEBBLES EARLY ON THAT THE AND. LOOKED AT. COMPREHENSIVELY COULD. PROPOSE A PROBLEM SO. DOCUMENTING. LET OTHER LEVELS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION TIGHTLY SO WHEN WE'RE COACHING MANAGEMENT. YOU KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE STUFF IN THE REAL WORLD. WE DO TELL THEM YOU KNOW YOU THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU WANT TO MAKE A NOTE OF. AND AND MAYBE THEY'RE NOT A FORMAL RIGHT UP AT THIS POINT THEY'RE JUST YOU KNOW YOU SAID IT MOMENTO FILE KIND OF THING. BUT IT IS MORE TO THE POINT OF SAYING IF MY EMPLOYEE CAME AND TOLD ME THIS. THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE NOTE OF IT. AND I'M AND I'M GOING TO DOCUMENT THAT I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THIS PERSON BECAUSE WHY WOULDN'T YOU. AND THEY ARE GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM IF YOU CAN THEN MAYBE IT DOES ESCALATE TO HR AT SOME POINT AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR DOCUMENTATION PLACING THE LOOK THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS FOR A WEEK. OR TWO OR A MONTH AND THIS IS WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND I THINK THERE DEFINITELY IS A PROBLEM. ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE HELPFUL BUT AS A YOU KNOW IF YOU ALL KNOW THEY'RE ALSO DISCOVERABLE SO. THIS IS THIS IS NOT A. YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD DISCOURAGE AT ALL BECAUSE WE WANT THAT DOCUMENTATION MOSTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE'S MEMORIES GET FUZZY. SO IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE THAT TIME STAMP IN THOSE ACCURATE NOTES YOU KNOW FOR ANYTHING THAT GOES FORWARD THE EVERYTHING IS. WE DON'T EVER WANT MANAGERS TO DO INVESTIGATIONS. THEY'RE NOT EQUIPPED TO DO SO. SO THEIR NOTES ARE IMPORTANT FOR A CHARGE YOU RECEIVE OR FOR COUNSEL TO RECEIVE SO THAT THEY CAN PURSUE WITH AN ACTUAL INVESTIGATION. THE DOCUMENTATION IS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU ANY LAST QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. EQUIPMENT THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT AND YOUR TAKING THE TIME TO COME AND SEE US TODAY. THANK YOU PROVIDING A SECURE WITHOUT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENTS IF THERE'S ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE.
