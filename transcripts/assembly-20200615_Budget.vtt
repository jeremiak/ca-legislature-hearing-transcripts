TO BE DOING- BACK FILLING THE

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:53.731

HOWEVER I'M ALSO PROBABLY NOT

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.714
ALONE IN HAVING SOME CONCERN

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.681
ABOUT THE FACT THEY WERE USING

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:12.349
A DEFERRAL IS THE MECHANIST FOR

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:13.984

00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:15.152
WONDERING IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.687
THE PROCESS THE THOUGHT PROCESS

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:18.289
THAT WAS USED. TO SETTLE ON A

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:19.590
DEFERRAL IS THE APPROPRIATE

00:39:19.657 --> 00:39:21.859
MECHANIC AND WHAT OTHER- WHAT

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:23.294
OTHER MECHANISMS WERE

CONSIDERED. YES OBERNOLTE ALL

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.136
THIS QUESTION AT THAT THOUGHT

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:34.405
PROCESS BEHIND THE DEFERRAL AND

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:35.906

MAY WANT TO ADD AS WELL. I

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:43.481
THINK THE FIRST IS THAT- THESE

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:45.282
DEFERRALS WHILE CERTAINLY NOT

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:48.886
IDEAL- YOU RELY ON LOCAL

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:50.054
SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:51.722
BORROWING. CAPACITY AND THEY

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.023
HAVE BEEN USED IN THE PAST

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.759
DURING TOUGH TIMES AND THERE'S

00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:56.660
NO QUESTION THAT. WE ARE IN A

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.229
TOUGH TIME NOW SO WE NEED TO

00:39:58.295 --> 00:39:59.930
BELIEVE THAT. A SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:01.465
IN THE STATE YOU HAVE THE

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:03.701
CAPACITY. TO MAKE. IT EASIER

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:06.036
FOR ALL AND THAT CONTINUE. IN

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.304
THE TIGHT BUDGET TIME THAT WE

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:08.806
ARE AND- TO TRY TO MEET THEIR

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:11.642
OBLIGATIONS- BUT I DEFINITELY

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:12.977
DO WANT TO KNOW THAT WHILE THE

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:15.412
DEFERRALS ARE ONE PART OF THE

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:16.981
WAY IN WHICH YOU COULD BUDGET.

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:20.117

CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY ONE AND

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.291
I THINK TWO OTHER ITEMS. OF

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:29.593
NOTE OUR NUMBER ONE DAY

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.462

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:09.620
AT THE ONE ONE FOUR AND THIS IS

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:12.056
THE- KEY REVENUE MEASURE THAT

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:14.058
IS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE- AND

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.259
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:16.961
ITEMS IN THE STEALTH BUT I WILL

00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:18.295
FOCUS VERY BRIEFLY ON THE

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:20.531
HIGHLIGHTS IN PARTICULAR THERE

00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:23.033
ARE Q. REVENUE MEASURE THAT WE

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.102
EXPECT COMBINED JERRY RAISED

FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.406

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:31.308
ADDITIONAL FUNDS OVER THE PHONE

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.677
TWO YEARS. THE FIRST IS THE-

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:35.412
SUSPENSION OF THE USE OF NET

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:38.515
OPERATING LOSSES- FOR TAXPAYERS

MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.054
THREE YEARS SO THIS WOULD BE

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:45.723
UNTIL THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.424
Q. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:50.361
A CAP ON THE USE- BUSINESS

00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:52.029

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:56.100
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND

00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:59.136
WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

00:43:59.203 --> 00:44:07.678

QUESTION IS- IN IN A SITUATION

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:39.963
WHERE FOR EXAMPLE A FILM STUDIO

WAS IN RELIANCE ON THE MOTION

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:44.835
PICTURE OF PRODUCTION TAX

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:47.304

GATE BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.393
THE CURRENT YEAR- I WILL SAY

00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:11.428
THAT GENERALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.764
THESE TYPES THAT. TAX MEASURES

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.966
AND AT THE CONFORMITY NECESSARY

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:18.135
THAT WE ALL DISCUSSED AND

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.870
WORKED ON A YEAR AGO WAS

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:22.072
INNOCENT MORE BOKEH GENERALLY

00:47:22.139 --> 00:47:23.473
WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THE

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.976
SACK. THANK YOU OFTEN GO RECTOR

AND I THINK IN THIS YEAR. IN

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:31.748
PARTICULAR BECAUSE THAT YOU

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.217
KNOW KOBE IT APPEARED ON THE

00:47:33.283 --> 00:47:34.751
SCENE IN JANUARY AN-

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:35.752
IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO HAVE AN

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:38.288
IMPACT AND THEN BY MARCH IS

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:41.091
WHEN WE SAW THAT STAY AT HOME

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:42.826
ORDER SO WE BELIEVE. IT IS

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:49.199
APPROPRIATE I THINK. WHEN THANK

00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:51.268
YOU THE SIDE THAT SOMEONE IN

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:53.036
THE EXTENT THAT YOU JUST GOT

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:54.605
WERE ON A TO YOU THAT CREDIT

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:55.973
RIGHT NOW IT MAY NOT BE IDEAL

00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:56.873
THEY MAY WANT USE IT NOW

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.742
UNDERSTAND BUT THEY WOULD BE

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:01.245
ABLE TO USE THAT IN A FUTURE

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:05.549
YEAR UNDER OUR- OKAY SO- I FIND

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:08.585
THAT VERY DISAPPOINTING. YOU

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:10.721
KNOW THESE COMPANIES THAT MADE

00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:14.124
GOOD FAITH DECISIONS BASED ON

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:16.627
THE EXISTENCE OF STATE LAW WHEN

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:18.829
THOSE DECISIONS WERE MADE AND I

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:19.596
DON'T THINK THE STATE IS ACTING

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:21.632
IN GOOD FAITH. IF WE THEN

00:48:21.698 --> 00:48:24.034
RETROACTIVELY REACH BACK IN

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.036
DISALLOW THOSE TAX CREDITS I

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.037
MEAN WE COULD TALK ABOUT DOING

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:28.572
PROSPECTIVELY BUT BUT TO HAVE

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:30.374
IT BE RETROACTIVE SEEMS TO ME

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.276
TO BE- TO BE COMPLETELY ON

00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:34.177
JUST. OP I WANT TO SHIFT

00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:36.880
DISCUSSION IF I COULD TO THE

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:38.649
DISALLOWANCE OF THE DEDUCTION

00:48:38.715 --> 00:48:41.652
FOR NET OPERATING LOSSES A AND

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:42.486
R. I REMEMBER THAT WE DID THIS.

00:48:42.552 --> 00:48:43.887
THE END DURING THE GREAT

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:45.856
RECESSION A SIMILAR A

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:47.591
PROHIBITION AGAINST THE USE OF

00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:49.159
THEM BUT AS I RECALL. THAT

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:50.627
PROHIBITION WAS ONLY FOR TWO

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:51.895
YEARS AND THAT WAS IN THE MIDST

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:54.197
OF THE GREATEST RECESSION SINCE

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.333
THE GREAT DEPRESSION- THIS

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.302
PROPOSAL IS FOR A THREE YEAR

00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.736
DISALLOWANCE OF THOSE NOT A

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:01.605
PROPERTY LOSSES- SO I'M

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:03.607
WONDERING WHY THREE YEARS WHY

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:04.741
NOT TWO YEARS AND WHY IS THIS

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:06.310
SITUATION MORE DIRE THAN THAT

00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:12.683
ONE WAS. AND THE QUESTION OF

00:49:12.749 --> 00:49:14.785
WHY IT SHOULD BE- WHY WE ARE

00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:16.420
PROPOSING A THREE YEAR PERIOD

00:49:16.486 --> 00:49:18.455
RATHER THAN A TWO YEAR PERIOD

00:49:18.522 --> 00:49:20.090
I'LL COMMENT VERY BRIEFLY IN

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:20.991
NINETEEN CHAMBER WHEN THEY-

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:24.394
WAIT. WHILE WHILE I. A GREAT

00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:26.663
VIEW THE PROCESS THE QUE SE IN

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.665
THE GRAY RECESSION CERTAINLY

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:31.501
WHAT WE ARE BEING MAINTAINED-

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:33.236
THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST THAT WE

00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:35.939
HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:37.974
TO PUT FORWARD. IS THAT ACT

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:41.645
HAVE BEEN USED. HOWEVER THE

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.146
THAT WE HAD PROJECTED BY CHEN.

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:45.449
FIRST YEARS YOU KNOW ON YEARS

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:47.384
OR OR EVEN MORE THAN THAT AND

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:48.852
SO WE FELT THAT A THREE YEAR

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:51.088
PERIOD OF WHAT'S APPROPRIATE-

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:53.323
AND WHEN THE ECONOMY DOES NOT

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:54.558
COVER THOSE ENTITIES WITHIN

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:55.959
THAT OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE

00:49:56.026 --> 00:49:58.495
ABLE TO USE THOSE CREDITS SO IN

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:00.530
THAT SENSE- THE STATE WOULD

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:01.932
ACTUALLY. BE RECEIVING LESS

00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:04.034
READING YOU IN THOSE YEARS AND

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:06.203
WE OTHERWISE WORKED SO I THINK

00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:07.337
I CAN SPEAK DIRECTLY WHEN IT

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:08.138
COMES TO THE PROJECTIONS THAT

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:10.374
WE'RE SEEING NOW WHILE WE VERY

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.777
MUCH HOPE THAT IN ONE YEAR OR

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:14.911
TWO YEARS. I NEED BE GOING UP

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.413
WELL ABOVE OUR PROJECTIONS

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.981
RIGHT NOW GIVEN WHAT WE'RE

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:19.316
BEING WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:21.084
TEMPORARY CHANGES YOU NEED TO

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:23.086
BE A FACTOR FOR THREE YEARS

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:25.822
BECAUSE THE REVENUE GAP THAT

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:27.124
WE'RE SEEING ARE NOT. WAIT FOR

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:31.361
THE NEXT YEAR BUT ARE FORTY

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:32.596
YEARS AFTER THAT. OKAY I'M I'M

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:33.897
NOT SURE ON FALL THE RE.

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:35.399
BECAUSE NO NO THE PROJECTIONS

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:37.401
THAT I'VE SEEN. INDICATE THAT

00:50:37.467 --> 00:50:38.668
THIS RECESSION IS GOING TO BE

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:42.005
MORE SEVERE THAN. THE GREAT

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:45.008
RECESSION. AND YOU KNOW THAT

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:46.076
SEEMS TO BE THE ARGUMENT THAT

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:47.411
THAT YOU'RE MAKING IS THAT- YOU

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:48.412
KNOW THAT THIS IS THIS THAT

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:49.846
MERITS A THREE YEAR.

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:51.081
DISALLOWANCE INSTEAD OF A TWO

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:52.215
YEAR DISALLOWANCE BUT I MEAN

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:53.016
THERE'S A LARGER ISSUE OF

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.151
FAIRNESS HERE I THINK WHICH IS

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:56.553
THAT- THE WE HAVE BUSINESSES

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.521
ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO ARE

00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:59.156
SUFFERING BECAUSE OF AN ACTION.

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.690
THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT TOOK IN

00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:01.858
CLOSING DOWN THE ECONOMY IN

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:04.661
RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS SO.

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:05.796
THOSE BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:06.997
REQUIRE AN INJECTION OF

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:09.433
CAPITAL. THIS YEAR JUST TO KEEP

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:10.734
THEIR DOORS OPEN SO THAT'S

00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:11.935
GOING TO CREATE A NOT OPERATING

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:13.270
LOSS THIS YEAR. THEN TAKE THOSE

00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:14.905
BUSINESSES THAT NEXT YEAR SURE

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:16.706
THEIR BUSINESS COVER A LITTLE

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:17.541
BIT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:18.942
MAKING A PROFIT. THAT THEY'RE

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:21.244
NOT I'M ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:22.512
LOSS IN THE CAPITAL WAS

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:23.246
REQUIRED TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESS

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:25.215
OPEN. I THINK IT'S VERY UNFAIR

00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:26.817
SO- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:28.618
THAT I REALLY A PROBLEM WITH

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:30.420
