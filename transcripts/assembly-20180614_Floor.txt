SENATE BILL EIGHT FORTY BY SENATOR MITCHELL AND ACTUALLY TO THE STATE BUDGET TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET BELT. MISTER TING YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AFTER FOUR MONTHS AND NINETY ONE HEARINGS IN BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEES. I STAND BEFORE YOU A PRESENT SB EIGHT FORTY OUR STATE BUDGET BILL. IT WASN'T VERY LONG AGO THAT THERE WERE REPORTS OF OUR STATE FALLING INTO BANKRUPTCY. OUR STATE HAVING AN INABILITY. HEY EVEN THE MOST BASIC BILLS. TODAY WE STAND VERY PROUD. THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAVE WE MADE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. MADE HISTORIC EVENTS WITHIN HIGHER READ CSU COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOU SEE. BUT WE ALSO ARE INSURING THAT WE ARE SAVING FOR A RAINY DAY WE NOW HAVE THE HIGHEST RESERVES IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN THE NEXT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COMES. THAT ONE WE HAVE TO MAKE THOSE VERY TOUGH CHOICES WERE NOT GONNA HAVE TO GO DO CUTS FIRST. WE CAN GO BACK INTO OUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN FUND MANY OF THOSE REVENUES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN COMING. BECAUSE OF OUR GREAT ECONOMY THAT HAVE COME TODAY. SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT WE ARE PRESENTING TODAY WE ARE NOW FUNDING ARE KEY THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION OUT ELEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER PUPIL THAT'S UP FROM TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED JUST TWO YEARS AGO. WE FUNDED THE UC AND CSU SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE. TO REYES TUITION ON THEIR STUDENTS THAT WAS VERY STRONG FEEDBACK WE HEARD REALLY ALL ACROSS THE STATE. AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT WE'VE ALSO INCREASED THEIR FUNDING SO THAT THEY CAN INCREASE ENROLLMENT PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WAS A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR US WE ARE NOW ADDING ONE BILLION OF FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS OVER THE NEXT. FOR YEARS WHICH IS GOING TO ADD THIRTEEN THOUSAND CHILDCARE SLOTS IN ALMOST THREE THOUSAND PRESCHOOL FLAWS. THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WHICH IS TOUCHED ALMOST EVERY CITY. IN OUR STATE USED TO BE PRIMARILY URBAN PROBLEM PRIMARILY SAN FRANCISCO. LOS ANGELES PROBLEM NOW IS NOT UNUSUAL TO GOING TO MODESTO OR FRESNO OR EVEN SOME MORE THE HARDEST HIT RULE AREAS WERE RECEIVED PEOPLE ON THE STREETS. SO WE ARE DOING A HISTORIC INVESTMENT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE ARE GIVING THE EMERGENCY MONEY FOR THIS EMERGENCY PROBLEM SO THAT CITIES COUNTIES COULD BUILD SHELTER. GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS OUT FAST AS POSSIBLE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT POVERTY IS A HUGE ISSUE IN OUR STATE WE HAVE ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY IN ARE STATE. AND DURING THE DOWNTURN THOSE PROGRAMS WERE PROBABLY THE MOST SEVERELY CUT. AND TO THIS POINT HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN BROUGHT BACK SO WITH TWO MAJOR INVESTMENTS ON CAL WORKS AS WELL AS WELL ALLOWING PEOPLE ON SSI ACCESS INTO CAL FRESH. WE ARE MAKING INVESTMENTS INTO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND GET BROUGHT BACK INTO THE PROSPERITY THAT THE REST OF THE STATE FEELING. WE BILL ON LAST YEAR'S INVESTMENT ON THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. BY EXPANDING PEOPLE AT THE YOUNGER AGE GROUP BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR BUT ALSO THE OLDEST. FOLKS OVER SIXTY FIVE TO BECOME PART OF THAT EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. WHICH IS ONE OF THE BEST WAY THAT WE KNOW TO FIGHT POVERTY HERE IN OUR STATE. I'M INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND OVER THE LAST DECADE WILL DECADES BECAUSE WE REALLY FRANKLY HAVEN'T. HAD THE RESOURCES WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT NOW THAT WE DO HAVE MONEY THAT WE ARE PUTTING MONEY ASIDE FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND OUR INTO OUR BUILDINGS IN OUR ROADS. LASTLY HEALTH CARE. HEALTH CARE WAS A MAJOR ISSUE ESPECIALLY FOR OUR BODY. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE KNOW O. WE HAVE ACHIEVED FULL UNIVERSAL ACCESS WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS SINCE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. GOING FROM 78% OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE 292% OF CALIFORNIA'S NOW. HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE BUT WE WERE ABLE TO GET. DOT HUGE A HUGE AN ISSUE ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. WE GOT TO TWO MAJOR WINS. ONE IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CELEBRATE HELPFUL. DEVELOP A PLAN. GET US TO UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE TO GET US 21100% WE ALL KNOW THAT THE LAST. A PERCENT AGAIN ANY POLICYHOLDERS TO GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE BUT WE ARE COMMITTED. AS CALIFORNIA'S A WE DON'T WERE MUCH BETTER AND STRONGER WE GET EVERYBODY INSURANCE. AND LASTLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A DATABASE TO PUT TOGETHER TO HAVE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND HEALTH CARE COSTS. HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE ONE OF THE MOST NON TRANSPARENT COSTS WE HAVE IN OUR ECONOMY AND WE KNOW THAT WE CAN DO BETTER. SO WITH THAT I PRESENT TO YOU SB EIGHT FORTY ARE BUDGET BILL RESPECTFULLY ASK DRIVER. THANK YOU MISTER TANG. MISTER OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH A BIG THANK YOU. TO EVERYONE THAT WAS INVOLVED IN CRAFTING THIS BUDGET IN PARTICULAR I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE STAFF THEY ARE THE UNSUNG HEROES OF THE BUDGET PROCESS OVER THE LAST FIVE MONTHS. THEY'VE INVESTED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF THEIR TIME I'M TALKING ABOUT THE STAFF NOT JUST ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. BUT ARE THE STAFF ON BOTH CAUCUSES AND ON OUR PERSONAL STAFF ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK. BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND ALL OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES FOR ALL OF THE WORK OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. YOU KNOW I'M REMINDED OF SOMETHING THAT MY WIFE SAID. TO ME JUST AFTER THE BIRTH OF OUR SECOND CHILD. AND I REMEMBER VIVIDLY SHE SAID IF WOMEN REMEMBERED HOW MUCH PAIN WAS INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. THEY WOULD NEVER VOLUNTEER TO DO IT AGAIN. AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO TRUE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND YET YOU SEE THE SAME PEOPLE VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR TO CRAFT A BUDGET SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO OUR CHAIR AND EVERYONE INVOLVED. BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF SUPPORTABLE ASPECTS TO THIS BUDGET. I'M VERY PLEASED THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE FULLY FUNDING OUR BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. WERE ALSO MAKING A VERY MEANINGFUL INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION WERE FULLY FUNDING THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND WE'RE INVESTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUR CAL STATES IN OUR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. HOWEVER I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF STATE SPENDING IN THIS BUDGET [inaudible] THIS IS. BY A SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN THE LARGEST BUDGET IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY ARE GENERAL FURTHER FUND SPENDING FOR THE FIRST TIME IS OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE INCREASE IN STATE SPENDING IS PARTICULARLY ALARMING WE HAVE INCREASE STATE SPENDING JUST COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR BY ELEVEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RATE. OF KING OF INCREASE OF STATE SPENDING THAT REPRESENTS IT IS OVER 9% OF INCREASE COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR. AND THIS IS IN AN ERA. WHEN AT THE RATE OF INFLATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS LESS THAN 3%? AND WE'RE POPULATION GROWTH IN THE STATE IS LESS THAN 1% TO TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY WE ARE INCREASING STATE SPENDING BY OVER THREE TIMES THE RATE OF INFLATION. THAT IS CLEARLY UNSUSTAINABLE AND ALTHOUGH I AM A SUPPORTER OF FUNDING OUR RESERVE ACCOUNTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE ARE FUNDING RESERVE ACCOUNTS TO THE POINT THAT WOULD REALLY ADEQUATELY CUSHION OUR STATE'S FINANCES IN THE EVENT OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IF WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE STATE SPENDING AT THE RATE THAT WE HAVE THEM FOR THAT REASON I ORIGINAL VOTE. DR CHOI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER AND THE MEMBERS -- I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE INVOLVED ARE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS SO SO I MEAN I THOUGHT I MEAN NOT TO REALIZE YEAH PAYING OF THE PROCESS BUT I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE PEOPLE. WHO GOT INVOLVED BUT LET ME GIVE YOU MY AND MY GENERAL IMPRESSION? ARE OF THE IS SO BUDGET. I WOULD BE OUR OUR OPPOSING NOT TODAY'S SO UP BUDGET PROPOSAL. THIS BUDGET IS OUR IT IT RESPONSIBLY ARE INCREASES SUPPLEMENT ON SPENDING OP BY ELEVEN POINT JUST SIX A BILLION DOLLARS SO OFTEN LAST YEAR. REPRESENTING. EIGHTY NINE POINT THE ONE PUTS AN INCREASE AS YOU HEARD. THIS BUDGET THAT INCREASES ON LONG TOM AWESTRUCK DRAWN LA SPENDING BY BILLIONS OF THE BALANCE. OF WHICH I OR NIAZ ADAMS SO FUTURE GENERATIONS SAW WITH THEM MORE BUREAUCRACY AND THE MORE SPENDING. IT CLAIMS THAT A SURPLUS OF A BILLIONS. AND YET THE YOU KNOW MORE SO THE STATE'S UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES SUCK AND THE HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE DESPITE THOUGH WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD. THAT NUMBER IN THE HUNDREDS OF A BILLION DOLLARS. THIS OUR LEGISLATURE HAS TO SPEND MORE TIME DEBATING YA PLASTIC STROLL BANDS AND THE FORM TAXES SO DOWN NOW ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA SO. APPROXIMATELY ONE TRILLION DOLLAR SIGN IN THE STATE TO AND A MUNICIPAL UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES. THIS IS THE ADDRESS OF THE TOPIC THAT I A ADDRESSED THE LAST YEAR AS WELL. DESPITE THE PULKOVO FISCAL YEAR RESTRAINING THIS IS SO I JUST THOUGHT AMADOR SMOKE AND MIRRORS. SPEND AND ATTACKS A BUDGET. NOT FABIO SO TO ADDRESS A THE STATE'S ALMOST A PRESSING CHALLENGES STAR AND ARE. COMPROMISED IS TALK AWARD LONG TERM ABILITY TO DELIVER BASIC SERVICES. I STRONGLY URGE AND THE RESPECTIVELY ASKING MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN OPPOSING SP YEAH [inaudible] EIGHT FORTY THANK YOU. MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES BROUGHT FORTH BY OUR VICE CHAIR. I AGREE THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET THE FUNDING FOR THIS CSU OF THE UC. ARM HEALTH FUNDING FOR A LS A SYSTEM OF CARE INFANT HEALTH DIABETES AWARENESS OUT REACH -- THOSE THINGS ARE GREAT -- HOWEVER. I DO QUESTION THE ACTION I'M ASSUMING IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION THAT ACTUALLY WOULD CHIU IMPORTANT ITEMS. THAT WERE SUPPORTED BY BOTH THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE. BUDGET COMMITTEE ON HEALTH THAT WERE PLACED IN THE BUDGET -- Y. WITH THESE ITEMS SELECTIVELY WITHDRAWN IN THE ELEVENTH HOUR SIGNIFICANT ITEMS WHICH IMPACT OUR PRIORITIES AS A STATE -- FOR EXAMPLE TREATMENT NAVIGATION FOR OPEN YOUR USERS WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY -- GROUPS SUCH AS THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO LGBTQ RESOURCE CENTER LOS ANGELES LGBT CENTER -- THIS A EFFORT WOULD HAVE FUNDED THE OFFICE OF AIDS TO RUN HARM REDUCTION PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE. BRING HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO TREATMENT. CLEANUP SYRINGES IN OUR HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ON ON OUR STREETS AND WOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK THAT WE SAW ON SAN DIEGO FOR EXAMPLE. I THINK OF HOW WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS HOMELESSNESS IS A HUGE ISSUE IN OUR STATE. OPIOID USE DISORDER HUGE ISSUE SURRENDERS TRASH AND THE HEALTH RISKS WE TALK ABOUT IT BUT YOU KNOW HERE'S A TIME WE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AT A TIME WHEN THE WE HAVE SURPLUS REVENUES. OTHER ITEMS CAUGHT IN THE ELEVENTH HOUR INCLUDE HIV S. T. D. PREVENTION EDUCATION FOR MEDICAL PROVIDERS. THESE ITEMS WERE SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA LGBT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NETWORK HARM REDUCTION COALITION LOS ANGELES SO GPT CENTER. PROJECT INFORM SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION ETCETERA SO -- YOU KNOW HIV DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS ON OLDER INDIVIDUALS THAT WAS TAKEN OUT. AS WELL AS HEPATITIS C. PREVENTION NO EXPLANATION I BEG THE QUESTION OF WHY WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AIDS ADDICTION YET ENOUGH FOR IT TO FINALLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THAT IMPACT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY SAN FRANCISCO LA AND SAN DIEGO ARE IN THE BUDGET THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE BUDGET THEY WEREN'T. PART OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND THEN THEY ARE REMOVED IN THE ELEVENTH HOUR -- WITHOUT EXPLANATION SO -- AYE URCHIN THOUGH VOTE. MISS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I I RISE TODAY TO URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BUDGET. FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS -- THOUGH YES THERE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS IN THIS BUDGET BUT YOU KNOW THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS BUDGET IS THAT IT'S BEEN RIGGED SO THAT NO REFUND CAN EVER BE GIVEN TO THE TAXPAYERS. NO CHANCE OF LOWERING THE SALES TAX RATE BY THE QUARTER PERCENT THAT IT SHOULD BE LOWERED SHOULD BE REACH THAT LIMIT. THIS BUDGET HAS BEEN RIGGED SO THAT THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. AND THAT'S DISGRACEFUL. I MEAN I DON'T. WORRY CREATING NEW SAVINGS ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO NOT GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS IT'S THEIR MONEY. WE DON'T NEED TO DO THIS. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT WE KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY TO COUNTIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING. MY COUNTY IN PARTICULAR THOUGH THERE ARE MANY. THEY ARE STRUGGLING WE'RE GIVING THEM NOTHING THAT'S NOT EVEN CONTEMPLATED IN THIS BUDGET SO WHILE. THE MAJORITY PARTY GOES ON A SPENDING SPREE. BECAUSE OF THE SURPLUS THAT WE HAVE YOU'RE GONNA TELL YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO CAN'T FIND A HOME WHO CAN'T AFFORD A HOME WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEIR RENT OR THEIR ELECTRICITY OR THEIR WATER BILL OR TO PHILLIP THEIR CAR. YOU'RE GONNA TELL THEM SORRY BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS ON OUR WISH LIST THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE MONEY ON THIS IS RIDICULOUS VOTE NOW. A SHIRT MCCARTY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS SPENDING PLAN IT'S RESPONSIBLE AND FAIR. I'M NOT PERFECT BUT IT IS ON SOLID AND I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THAT COULD THE CRITICISMS I THINK THAT THIS BUDGET. AS OUR CHAIRMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO DISCUSSES FOCUSES ON SAVING AND REALLY LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST COULD YOU LOOK BACK. TO GOVERNOR'S AGO. WE HAD EXTRA MONEY. WE HAD A SURPLUS. AND WE OVER COMMITTED OURSELVES. WE SAID THAT MONEY BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS WE OVER COMMITTED AN ON GOING. PROGRAMS AND THERE WAS A PRICE TO PAY WE HAD TO INCREASE TAXES ON CALIFORNIANS WE HAD TO SLASH. EDUCATION PROGRAMS HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS IT WAS PAINFUL FOR EVERYBODY SO WHAT WE DO HERE. WE LEARN FROM THOSE LESSONS OF THE SO CALLED NINE BILLION DOLLARS OVER HALF OF IT IS SAVED. FOR A SO CALLED RAINY DAY. WAITING FOR THE NEXT RECESSION BECAUSE IT WILL COME. AND THE OTHER MONEY IS SPENT ON RESPONSIBLE THINGS LIKE ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE AND EDUCATION I KNOW IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE WE HAD UNANIMOUS VOTE ON OUR SPENDING PLAN BECAUSE WE ALL SUPPORT MORE MONEY GOING TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. TO EARLY EDUCATION TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS TO OUR UC'S TO OUR CS USE. THAT'S A PRIORITY TO DETER TO SAY THAT IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE SPENDING I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY. ARE NOT THE CASE AND THE NOTION THAT WE'RE SPENDING THIS MONEY ON ON GOING SPANISH JURORS LIKE SO CALLED DRUNKEN SAILORS. GO TALK TO THE PEOPLE ROTH WAS FOR MORE MONEY AND HEALTH CARE GO TALK TO PEOPLE OFFICE FOR MORE MONEY IN EARLY EDUCATION. GO TALK TO PEOPLE ASK US FOR MORE MONEY. AND OTHER SOCIAL PROGRAMS WE COULD NOT GOING BECAUSE WE'RE FOCUSING ON ONE TIME NEEDS AND SAVING FO THE FUTURE IN OUR CORE EDUCATION. THAT EXPENSES SO IN SOME OF THESE ACCIDENTS WILL HELP US WITH THE NEXT DOWNTURN -- THEY CUSHION US FROM FUTURE PAINFUL CUTS IN EDUCATION. AND HEALTH CARE AND PRETTY THE CUSHION US FROM POTENTIAL A HARMFUL TAX INCREASES TO OUR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AROUND CALIFORNIA AGAIN THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE SPENDING PLAN. ASK YOUR ABOUT THANK YOU. THINGS REGARDING MR FRAZIER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES ARE RISE -- TO HIGHLIGHT SOME ISSUES THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WITH THIS BUDGET. AS YOU ALL KNOW SAFETY OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS A HUGE PRIORITY OF MINE SINCE MY DAUGHTER DIED ON A CALIFORNIA STATE HIGHWAY. UNFORTUNATELY SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE THE STATE'S HIGHWAYS BECAUSE HAVE BECOME LESS SAFE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN CRASHES OF INCREASED 29%. AND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS PER MILE DRIVEN HAS INCREASED 27%. THE STATISTICS FAR OUTPACED THE STATE'S POPULATION GROWTH OF 8%. AS WELL AS THE INCREASE HAVE BEEN LICENSED DRIVERS AND REGISTERED VEHICLES OF 11%. DECLINING SAFETY OF OUR HIGHWAYS IS DIRECTLY RELATED. TO THIS FACT SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN THE NUMBER OF HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS ON OUR ROADS HAS ACTUALLY DECREASED BY 5% MATTER OF FACT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE HIGHWAY PATROL WAS CUT THREE HUNDRED POSITIONS AND NEVER RESTORE. LET ME REITERATE THIS POINT. CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION NUMBER OF REGISTER VEHICLES AND LICENSED DRIVERS. CAN YOU TO INCREASE WHILE HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS HAVE BECOME [inaudible] FEWER. THE RESULT OF THESE DIVERGENT TRENDS ARE CLEAR. MORE ACCIDENTS AND AN INCREASED FATALITY RATE. MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY DAY. IT'S TIME FOR OUR STATE TO TAKE ACTION TO REVERSE THIS TREND AND WE PROBABLY FUND THE OFFICERS WE NEED AND DEPEND ON TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS CAN TRAVEL SAFELY. THIS IS WHY I HAVE ASKED FOR MORE FUNDING FOR CHP OFFICERS IN THIS BUDGET. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T BELIEVE THIS IS A PRIORITY THEREFORE WE WERE DENIED THIS REQUEST. INSTEAD WE PRIORITIES PRIORITIZE OTHER NEW SPENDING SUCH AS A BUNCH OF NEW POSITIONS AT THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD TO DO ADMINISTRATIVE WORK AND BUILD DATABASES. WE'RE DEDICATING SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE GENERAL FUND TO REDUCE THE WHAT RISK OF WHALEN SEA TURTLE ENTANGLEMENT. BUT INCLUDE KNOWN NEW FUNDING TO REDUCE THE RISK OF PEOPLE DYING ON OUR HIGHWAYS. AMAZINGLY WE APPROACH OF UP WERE PROVING TWO POINT NINE MILLION FOR PHASE [inaudible] ONE SPACE OPTIMIZATION. OF PROJECT FOR THE CALIFORNIA EPA HEADQUARTERS. MEANWHILE THE BUDGET TRANSFERS OF EIGHTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT TO THE GENERAL FUND. WHICH HAVE BEEN. SHOULD HAVE BEEN UTILIZED FOR THE ADDITIONAL OFFICERS DESPERATELY RICK NEEDED RIGHT NOW. THIS FUNDING COULD PROVIDE THE STATE WITH FOUR HUNDRED MORE OFFICERS. AND BRING THE DEPARTMENT BACK TO THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS THAT HAD. BEFORE THE RECESSION. I REPEAT BEFORE THE RECESSION. INSTEAD THE MONEY'S GOING TO THE GENERAL FUND WHERE WE EXPECT TO HAVE A SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. OUR ROADS ARE LESS SAFE AND WE HAVE THE MEANS TO ADDRESS IT. THE BUDGET FAILS TO DO SO. SO IT MAKES ME QUESTION OUR PRIORITIES WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS DIFFICULT SITUATION. SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES. PLEASE HELP ME NEXT IN THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE AND MAKE A COMMITMENT. A SAFE CALIFORNIA'S LIVES SO THEIR FAMILIES WON'T HAVE TO SUFFER LIKE I DID WHEN MY DAUGHTER DIED. MEMBERS IF YOU WISHED TO SPEAK. PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW. PLEASE RAISE YOUR MAC FUNDS NOW IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK. MISTER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. WELL THERE ARE MANY THINGS I CAN SAY GOOD ABOUT THIS BUDGET I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSCORE THAT I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS BUDGET FAILS TO RETURN MORE DOLLARS TO THE HARD WORKING CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. EVEN AS WE SEE THIS NINE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. IN I WANT TO AFFIRM THE POINT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE. THAT WITH FUNDS IN THE STATE'S EMERGENCY ACCOUNT TOTALING MORE THAN 4% OF GENERAL REVENUE. A QUARTER CENT SALES TAX SHOULD BE TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY. IS DUE TO LAWS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO KEEP STATE LAWMAKERS FROM HARDING FUNDS YET GOVERNOR BROWN LEGISLATIVE DEMOCRATS OF DECIDE TO BE CREATIVE. IN THEIR ACCOUNTING PRACTICES TO CREATE NEW SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THAT WOULD BYPASS THE EXPECTED SALES TAX CUT AND I THINK THIS IS WRONG NO MATTER HOW HOW ABOUT YOU CUT IT. ADDITIONALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT FEDERAL TAX REFORM THAT'S IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE ITS NOT INCLUDING. INCOME TAX RELIEF. WE NEED A SPECIFIED THAT WHEN WE OUT THESE KINDS OF REVENUES THAT IT'S AND CALIFORNIANS ARE INDEED OVER TAX. AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THIS STATE IS TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS TO KEEP MORE OF THEIR OWN HARDER AND HARDER AND DOLLARS. AND THAT'S WHY A LOT ONE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IN FUTURE BUDGETS ARE THAT WE INCLUDE MERE AYE. INCOME TAX REFORM THAT ALLOWS FOR AN STATE TAX REDUCTION I THINK YOU VERY MUCH A MUCH SPEAKER MEMBERS IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THE ITEM PLEASE REFER MICROPHONES NOW MR THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT FORTY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SAYINGS IS THE ONE THAT GOES -- YOU SHOW YOUR VALUE. I WOULD YOU PUT YOUR BUDGET. A AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE COULD ADVOCATE FOR THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THIS IN MORE OF THAT -- BUT ON BALANCE THIS IS IN FACT. A BUDGET THAT STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE. WE HAVE LISTENED TO THE VOTERS WHO'VE ASKED US. TO BE PREPARED FOR RAINY DAY WE HAVE ENHANCED AND MAXIMIZE SAVINGS A FOR FUTURE DOWNTURNS THIS BUDGET PROVIDES MORE. FOR IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS THAT HELP CALIFORNIANS LIKE A COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE UC'S ARE YOU SEE ISSUES WE PUT MORE MONEY INTO K. TWELVE EDUCATION. AND WE PUT MORE MONEY INTO EARLY EDUCATION AND WE PROVIDE DOLLARS TO SUPPORT. LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES TO THE EITC AND OTHER PROGRAMS TO HELP. CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING. AND WE'VE HEARD. FROM OUR CITIES THAT THEY NEED HELP. THEY NEED HELP TO ADDRESS. HOMELESS CHALLENGE THAT CONTINUES TO GROW AND INTENSIFY EVERY SINGLE DAY COLLEAGUES THIS CALL IT WHAT IT IS A VOTE AGAINST THIS BUDGET. YOU CAN IS REALLY A VOTE AGAINST ALL OF THESE THINGS CALIFORNIA'S HAVE ASKED US. A PORT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE YES IT SHOW YOUR VALUE. BY WHAT WE PUT INTO OUR BUDGET. THANK YOU MISS THURMOND. MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS MEMBERS THIS BUDGET BILL TOUCHES ON EVERY PART OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE LIVE. AND ON THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO IMPROVE. WE LOVE OUR OCEANS ARE MOUNTAINS ARE STANDING ENVIRONMENT. AND THIS BUDGET HELPS US TO PROTECT WHAT'S THERE. AND WORKS TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE.

MR OBERNOLTE THANK MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS TO BE CLEAR THIS IS THE ONLY TRAILER BILL THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING TODAY THAT AFFECTS THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET. NOT OF THE NEXT YEAR BUDGET WHICH STARTS JULY FIRST IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IN FACT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO EXACTLY ESTIMATE WHAT REVENUES ARE EXPENDITURES ARE GOING TO BE IN A GIVEN YEAR. SO IT'S NECESSARY TO GO BACK AND TRUE UP THE FIGURES WITH THE ESTIMATES THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. OF THESE EXPENDITURES TO BE CLEAR HEARD BY THE STATE AND THEREFORE THIS IS SUPPORTABLE AYE URGENT AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS NEXT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE THIS IS S. B.. EIGHT FOUR EIGHT THE CORPORATE. SENATE BILL EIGHT FORTY EIGHT BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AND ACTUALLY TO TRANSPORTATION MAKING A PREPARATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET. MISTER TECH. THANK YOU FOR SPEAKER S. B. EIGHT FOUR EIGHT IS OUR TRANSPORTATION TRAILER BILL ABOUT THE BILL LIMITS CALTRANS ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES FOR WORK IT DOES FOR THE TWENTY FOUR SELF HELP COUNTIES. IT ALSO POSTS AN ADDITIONAL ONE DOLLAR TRANSACTION FEE TO RECOUP THE COST. DMV SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS FOR FIVE YEARS. BUT THAT I ASCRIBE. MR OBERNOLTE YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS BILL ALLOWS CITIES AND COUNTIES TO BORROW AGAINST THE REVENUE. FROM THE GAS TAX INCREASE THAT WAS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR. GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT VOTERS WILL BE CONSIDERING A REPEAL OF THIS GAS TAX INCREASE ON THE BALLOT THIS NOVEMBER. IT SEEMS VERY UNWISE TO ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES TO BORROW AGAINST REVENUE WHICH MAY NOT BE THERE. ANOTHER THING THAT THIS TRAILER BILL DOES IS IT IMPOSES AN ADDITIONAL ONE DOLLAR PER TRANSACTION TAX. ON PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO PROCESS VEHICLE REGISTRATION AND TITLE CHANGES. THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES SEEK TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLE FIELD OFFICES AND THEREFORE THEY REDUCE LINES AND WAIT TIMES WITHIN THOSE FIELD OFFICES WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE AS A STATE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH. RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID THAT IF YOU WANT MORE OF SOMETHING YOU SHOULD SUBSIDIZE IT AND IF YOU WANT LESS OF SOMETHING YOU SHOULD TAXES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT MORE OF SO WE SHOULD BE SUBSIDIZING IT WE SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE TAXING IT. ARGENEAU VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. MISTER LACKEY YOUR RECKON. YES OF SPEAKER MEMBERS REAL QUICKLY I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE REMARKS BY OUR COLLEAGUE GO [inaudible] FROM OAKLEY. INDICATED THE THE ABSENCE OF ANY SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE NEW NORMAL WITH ALL THESE NEW FIRES. THAT TO AND THEY CONTINUALLY HAVE TO SUPPORT. AND IT PUTS A A SIGNIFICANT. STRAIN ON EACH ONE OF THE COMMANDS. TO BE ABLE TO DO THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT THAT'S ALSO. PART OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY SO UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VERY CRITICAL SERVICE. ASPECT IN TRANSPORTATION SO I WOULD URGE A NOBLE. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY MISS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU FOR THE MUSICAL INTERLUDE -- SO I AM GOING TO URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS NUMBER ONE THIS LEGISLATURE IS ENCOURAGING LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO PUT THINGS ON THE CREDIT CARD. WHY ARE WE DOING NOW WHY ARE WE ENCOURAGING OUR CITIES TO PUT THINGS ON THE CREDIT CARD TO GO INTO DEBT TO BORROW AGAINST FUTURE FUNDING? FOR FINDING THAT MAY NOT EXIST. IF THERE'S REPEAL OF THE GAS TAX AND UP ON THE BALLOT SO THEN WHAT THEN WHAT ARE CITY SPACE TO DO THEN THEY'RE STUCK HOLDING THE BAG. BECAUSE THEY BORROWED AGAINST THEIR FUTURE ANOTHER FUNDS AREN'T THERE. TO COVER THOSE COSTS SECONDLY [inaudible] ARE I KNOW THIS IS HOW THESE TRAILER BILLS WORK BUT WHY DO WE HAVE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS GOING. FOR A BICYCLE CORRIDOR POD PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES. THAT IS RIDICULOUS AND INSULTING BY URGING A VOTE. MISTER HARPER YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I IS MORE MORE CALIFORNIANS ARE DEMANDING REPEAL THE GAS TAX I CONTINUE TO CALL FOR INSTEAD. THAT NINE POINT ALTERNATIVE PLAN FOR FUNDING OUR TRANSPORTATION NEEDS I THINK WE NEED TO GET ON THE BALL AND UNDERSTAND WHAT CALIFORNIANS ARE ASKING FOR WHICH IS NOT ADDITIONAL TAXES. BUT MORE WISELY SPENDING THE MONEY WE ALREADY HAVE AND MAKING OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PRIORITY WITHOUT EXISTING FUNDING. WE NEED TO LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT PATH TOWARDS OUR TRANSPORTATION BUDGETING AYE AND I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE ON THIS BILL. SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. RETAIN YOU MAY BECAUSE WE WISH. WITH THAT. CLERK WILL DRAW. ON THEM AS HER DESIRE TO VOTE ON MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE CLERK WILL. CLOSER ROLE AND TALLY THE VOTE ICE BEFORE KNOWS TWENTY FOUR THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS WE HAVE AMENDMENTS. ON THIS NEXT ITEM. AMENDMENTS TO S. B. EIGHT FIFTY THAT CORPORATE GREED. SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY WITH AMENDMENTS BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TALLY. MISTER DALLI ARE THE METHODS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE. TO OFFER THESE AMENDMENTS THAT INVALIDATED CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION'S MANDATE. THAT MOST RESIDENTIAL HOMES. THERE ARE TO BE BUILT WAS SOLAR. WE SHOULD KNOW THAT WE OVERPRODUCED SOLAR IN THE STATE ALREADY. AND BY ADDING MORE -- SOLAR IS GOING TO DRIVE THE PRICE UP OF HOUSING -- AT ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOME. AS THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL ESTIMATED WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR THE FOR AN ANNUAL A FOR A NORMAL MORTGAGE MEMBERS -- WE LET IT A BUREAUCRACY OR BUREAUCRATS THAT AREN'T ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. MAKE THIS -- BECOME LAW AND WE'RE GONNA FORCED A HOMEOWNERS TO PUT SOLAR ON THEIR HOMES WERE ALREADY OVER PRODUCING SOLAR IN CALIFORNIA. SO IONS THAT YOU ADOPT THESE MINUTES AND WE COME BACK AND THAT WE ARE. REMOVE IT AND WE START LOOKING AT THINGS THAT REALLY ARE GOING TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT WE SHOULD BE PRODUCING. GREEN ENERGY WHEN THE SUN IS NOT SHINING BECAUSE WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING WERE ACTUALLY PAYING OTHER STATES. TO TAKE OUR ENERGY AND WE'RE OVERDUE SECRETS OR SUBSIDIZE THEM THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED NAY GALLAGHER MOVED TO LEYVA AMENDMENTS.

SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW AND ACTUALLY THE HOUSING MAKING A PREPARATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET. MISTER TING YOU MAKE AN OPEN. THANK IT WAS SPEAKER S. B. A FIFTY AS OUR HOUSING TRAILER BILL THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. PROGRAM WITH THAT IT IS THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM WHICH IS BEING ESTABLISH. DISTRIBUTES OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO OUR CITIES IN OUR COUNTIES AND REALLY HELPING THEM FIGHT HOMELESSNESS ON OUR STREETS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS. DISTRIBUTED BY FORMULA BY THE GOVERNOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DIRECTLY ALLOCATED TO CITIES WITH A POPULATION OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND LAST WE A HUNDRED MILLION. TO BE DISTRIBUTED BASED ON THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOMELESS POINT IN COUNT -- WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I DON'T. THE IMAGE TING MISTER OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I DON'T THINK A SINGLE PERSON IN THIS CHAMBER WOULD DISPUTE. A STATEMENT THAT HOMELESSNESS IS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN FACT WE RT SPELLBOUND A STUNNING AMOUNT OF MONEY. FIGHTING THIS PROGRAM BUT BEFORE WE SPEND MORE MONEY. ON THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO TAKE. SOMETIME AND DO SOME INTROSPECTION ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF WHAT WE ARE DOING. BECAUSE DESPITE ALL OF THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND ON THIS PROBLEM. THE ISSUE CONTINUES TO WORSEN IN FACT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW HAS THE WORST HOMELESSNESS. OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY 25%. OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION OF THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. IS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER. THE APPROACH THAT WE ARE TAKING TO FIGHTING THIS PROBLEM ANY PARTICULAR CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE TREATING THE SYMPTOM OF HOMELESSNESS. OR THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS. I'M REMINDED OF A SITUATION WHERE A PATIENT GOES TO SEE A DOCTOR HE SAYS DOCTOR I HAVE A HEADACHE. AND THE DOCTOR DIAGNOSES BRAIN CANCER. SO YOU WOULD EXPECT THE DIAG THE DOCTOR TO TREAT THE CANCER YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT THE DOCTOR TO TELL THE PATIENT TAKE TWO ASPIRIN THAT'LL FIX THE PROBLEM. AND I FEEL. THAT THAT'S THE SITUATION WITH HOMELESSNESS WITH THIS BILL WE ARE TREATING THE SYMPTOM OF HOMELESSNESS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE HOMES. WERE WE NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS. THESE ROOT CAUSES ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO SOLVE ADMITTEDLY BUT THEY ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD THEIR THINGS LIKE SUBSTANCE ABUSE [inaudible] JOBLESSNESS [inaudible] MENTAL ILLNESS. AGING ISSUES AND LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND LET US NOT FORGET THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. SO BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD BY TREATING THE THE SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM I THINK WE SHOULD PAPER PUT MORE ATTENTION TO TREATING THOSE ROOT CAUSES ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WAY THAT THE FUNDING IN THIS BILL IS DISTRIBUTED. HALF OF THE FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN BLOCK GRANTS IS DISTRIBUTED OF THIS TRAILER BILL. ARE USING A SYSTEM CALLED THE POINT IN TIME COUNT AND THAT'S A SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT. THE LARGEST CITIES IN OUR STATE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE SMALLER CITIES AND COUNTIES IN OUR STATE SUCH AS THE ONES THAT I REPRESENT. I CAN TELL YOU WE ARE SEEING HOMELESSNESS IN PARTS OF OUR STATE WHERE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE INCLUDING MANY OF THE PARTS IN OUR DISTRICT. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE STATEWIDE NOT JUST IN THE LARGEST CITIES ARGENEAU VOTE. MISS QUIRK SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AND ESPECIALLY TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM ORANGE COUNTY. THIS MEASURE S. B. EIGHT FIFTY AND A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN IS IN FACT CENTRAL TO THE HOMELESS CHALLENGE WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING THROUGHOUT ALL OF ORANGE COUNTY AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS NOT A SECRET THAT BOTH THE COUNTY AND CITIES IN MY DISTRICT ARE BEING CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURT TO STEP UP AND JOINED. THE EFFORT TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS ARAFAT. THIS LAST WEEKEND I WALKED THE RAILROAD TRACKS FROM FULLERTON TO ANAHEIM WHAT THE FEDERAL JUDGE JUDGE CARTER TO SEE THEM CAN'T MINUTES THAT WE WOULD ALL BE SHOCKED TO SEE NOT ONLY IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE SEEN THESE ENCAMPMENTS ACROSS THE RIVER BED IN ORANGE COUNTY AND THIS IS NOT THE CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF THIS IS THE CALIFORNIA THAT WE MUST ACT TOGETHER AS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. TO FIGHT THIS ISSUE SO ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT ONE SOLUTION THERE ARE MANY FROM MENTAL HEALTH TO HEALTH CARE TO EDUCATION TO PERMANENT HOUSING AND EMERGENCY HOUSING SO I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TO SUPPORT THOSE. THAT ARE FACING HOMELESSNESS. THIS MELENDEZ YOUR RECOMMENDS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THIS STATE HAD SPENT NEARLY ONE TRILLION DOLLARS ON FIGHTING POVERTY INFIGHTING HOMELESSNESS YET WHAT HAS HAPPENED. IT HAS INCREASED OKAY ONE POINT TWO BILLION LOCAL BOND ISSUE IN LA FOR HOMELESSNESS. THE CITY COUNCIL SAID NO THANK YOU. KAZAN WANTED IN THEIR BACKYARD THE MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT SAN FRANCISCO SPENDS TO TURN SIXTY MILLION ANNUALLY ON HOMELESSNESS. TELL ME HOUSE THE HOMELESS POPULATION DECREASED IN SAN FRANCISCO OR INCREASED IF YOU'VE BEEN THERE RECENTLY YOU WOULD KNOW THAT IT AS INCREASED AS IT HAS ACROSS THIS STATE THAT ARE THE ANSWER. IS NOT ALWAYS THROW MORE MONEY AT IT BECAUSE THIS SOLUTION SEEMS LIKE THE INTENT IS TO JUST GET THE HOMELESS POPULATION OUT OF SIGHT OF PEOPLE SO THAT THEY FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A HOMELESS PROBLEM. AND THERE IS MORE THAN ONE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM THE IT BUT THE ONLY SOLUTION IS BRINGING FORWARD. IS MONEY. TEMPORARY HOUSING TEMPERATE WHAT ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT CAUSE PEOPLE TO BE HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHAT ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA WHAT ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF ELECTRICITY OF WATER OF GAS OF RENTING A HOME OF BUYING A HOME? EVERYTHING IN CALIFORNIA IS EXPENSIVE AND HAS GOTTEN MORE EXPENSIVE. THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS BUT THERE'S NO SOLUTION ON THIS FLOOR TO TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE ISSUES IT'S JUST LET'S JUST TAKE MORE TAXPAYER MONEY. AND TRY TO PUT A BAND AID OVER THIS PROBLEM. PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY SO I'M ASKING YOU AT WHAT POINT WILL THIS LEGISLATURE TAKES SERIOUSLY. THE EPIDEMIC THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE STATE REGARDING THE HOMELESS THE NEED MORE THAN JUST TEMPORARY HOUSING THEY NEED MORE THAN JUST A BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE. WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WHEN IN FACT WE'RE NOT MOVING THE BALL FORWARD I URGE A NO VOTE. I THINK THIS ONE IS. SEE NO DISH NO DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM MISTER TING YOU MAY CLOSE THINKING THAT SPEAKER -- THANK YOU FOR THE VERY APPROPRIATE DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS IT VERY MUCH IS A CRISIS AND ALL OF OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO PUT DOWN THE STATE. THAT THE FUNDING IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE POPLATION OF HOMELESSNESS SO WELL WITH DUE RESPECT FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE STATE. DOES GET MONEY IN THIS FORMULA FUNDING HOWEVER THE COUNTIES WITH THE LARGEST POPULATION OF HOMELESS IS DID GET MORE AND THAT'S REALLY HOW IT WAS BASED IN MIXED TEAMS BECAUSE SENSE. YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT MORE FUNDS THE PROBLEM THIS YEAR TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY IS SPREAD ALL ACROSS THE STATE. WITH DO RESPECT TO ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED WE WE COMPLETELY AGREE WE ACTUALLY NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING WE LAST YEAR. OF THIS LEGISLATURE ACTED IN HISTORIC FASHION ON A LARGE SCALE HOUSING PACKAGE WE KNOW THAT THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING. NOT AND WE NEED TO KEEP MAKING SURE THAT WE BUILD MORE HOUSING MORE PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL AS MORE MARKET RATE HOUSING THAT ACTUALLY IS. PART OF THE SOLUTION MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY A KEY COMPONENT WE HAVE -- PARTS IN TRAILER BILLS AS WELL AS IN THE BUDGET WHERE WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE DEFTLY DON'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO AND WE SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION. TO WITH SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY ACUTELY AWARE IS AN ISSUE ON DRUG ABUSE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH IN THE BUDGET WILL BE AT LYFT UP APPROPRIATED MORE MONEY IN THIS BUDGET ABSOLUTELY. BUT AGAIN WE WANTED TO BE FISCALLY PRUDENT MIXTURE WE SET ASIDE RESERVES MAKE SURE WE WERE -- INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE SO I THINK IT IS OUGHT HAD ONE POINT. FOR GONNA PEOPLE ARGUE THAT WE'RE SPENDING TOO MUCH AND YET WE'RE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH IN THESE OTHER AREAS. AGAIN I THINK WHAT WE DID IS WE HAVE A VERY BALANCED APPROACH TO THIS BUDGET WE INVESTED IN OUR BIGGEST PRIORITIES WAS AROUND EDUCATION. TO THE CENTERPIECE BUT WE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DEALT WITH THIS HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WHICH HAS BEEN SPREAD ALL ACROSS OUR STATE WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT.

THEY WERE SITTING MISTER OBERNOLTE ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I HAVE A DEEP RESPECT FOR THE WORK THAT OUR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS DO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS. WITH THIS MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THIS IS A SINGLE YEAR M. O. U.. THAT IMPLEMENTS A 5% GENERAL SALARY INCREASE. AND THIS IS IN A YEAR WEIGH ON INFLATION IS UNDER 3% OR INCREASING GENERAL SALARIES FOR THIS BARGAINING UNIT BY ALMOST TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE HIGHEST COST PER INCARCERATED PRISONER OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THIS SUMMER YOU WILL EXACERBATE THAT SITUATION. I HAVE A FURTHER CONCERN WITH THE MO YOU. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES IS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. AT LEAST SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE SYMBOL YOU. AND THAT REPORT IS SUPPOSED TO DETAIL. DIFFERENCES AND COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE SALARIES AND COMPENSATION OF MEMBERS OF THIS BARGAINING UNIT. WITH SIMILAR EMPLOYEES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY. THE LEGISLATURE HAS NEVER RECEIVED THAT REPORT. AM WITHOUT THE CONTEXT THAT THAT REPORT WOULD PROVIDE I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO APPROVE AN INCREASE IN SALARY OF THIS SIZE ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE SINGH NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION.

THEY COMMIT SPEAKER A. B. EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX IS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TRAILER BILL. THIS BILL FOR THE POOR GOVERNANCE IN FINANCING MODEL FOR REBUILDING THE CAPITAL ANNEX. THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE A BUILDING SWINGS SPACE ON ó STREET BETWEEN TENTH AND ELEVENTH. FELL BENCH WOULD BECOME A NEW STATE OFFICE BUILDING. THE PROJECT WILL BE MANAGED BY THE PUBLIC WORKS COURT WITH INPUT FROM THE LEGISLATURE. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. TEAMS TING MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER WOULD AGREE THAT THE CAPITAL AND ACTS IS IN DIRE NEED. OF RECONSTRUCTION OR REPLACEMENT HOWEVER I FIND IT VERY TROUBLING THAT THIS TRAILER BILL EXAMS THE ENTIRE CAPITAL ANNEX PROJECT. FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE STATE CONTRACT CODE INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS FOR COMPETITIVE BIDDING. I FIND IT EXTREMELY HYPOCRITICAL. THAT WE TELL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY MUST COMPLY WITH THE STATE CONTRACTED CODE FOR THEIR REQUIREMENTS. BUT THEN WE EXEMPT OURSELVES FROM OUR OWN LARGEST PROJECT PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE STATE ANNEX RECONSTRUCTION WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST LARGE OR ONE LARGEST. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS IN THE ENTIRE STATE WHEN IT'S DONE I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER ACOSTA. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED REGARDING THE CONTRACTING PROVISIONS OF THAT I FIND EGREGIOUS IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL HAVING COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT BEING DICTATED TO BY THIS CHAMBER IN THIS HOUSE -- HOW WE SHOULD? OPERATE. I HAVE SOME OF THE POINTS REGARDING. THIS PARTICULAR BILL -- THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW BONDS THIS BILL AUTHORIZED REPRESENT FRANKLY A GRAVE INJURY TO MY CONSTITUENTS -- LOOK TO THIS BUILDING NEEDS UPGRADES THE AT THE ANNEX NEEDS UPGRADES BUT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN UPGRADE THE EXISTING BUILDING -- FOR A FAR CHEAPER PRICE -- LOOK MEMBERS IS PRICES SIMPLY JUST TOO HIGH AND IT AND FRANKLY I THINK IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE IF THERE'S IF THERE'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET. OFFER OTHER FOR OUR PROJECTS IF THERE'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WE WANT TO BE SPENDING IT LET'S LOOK AT THE PROJECTS THAT SHOULD BE SHOULD BE SPENDING WE SHOULD BE SPENDING IT ON OURSELVES A NEW SWANKY OFFICES. THIS LEGISLATURE TOLD THE FOSTER YOUTH IN MY DISTRICT AS THEY DID EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN RICHMOND ACTIVITIES WAS TOO MUCH. AND I HAVE TO QUESTION HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR POLITICIANS OFFICES WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE SAYS THAT AT RISK YOUTH IN MY DISTRICT OTHERS. AS THEY DID EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT FEEDER PROGRAMS TO LEARN CONSTRUCTION SKILLS OR CARE FOR THE ELDERLY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE I HAVE TO QUESTION THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FOR SHINY NEW OFFICES UR POLITICIANS WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE SAYS IT'S TOO PRICEY DO ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES GET IMMEDIATE SERVICES I WONDER HOW WE CAN AFFORD A BRAND NEW CAPITOL BUILDING. WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE AS IT DID EARLIER THIS YEAR SAYS THAT LIMITED TAX CREDITS WOULD ENSURE FULL EMPLOYMENT AND BETTER WAGES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT DISABLED IN MY COMMUNITY? IS A SO CALLED EXPENDITURE THAT IS TOO EXPENSIVE TO AFFORD. I FRANKLY HAVE TO SHAKE MY HEAD AND WONDER HOW WE CAN AFFORD SWANKY NEW OFFICES FOR POLITICIANS MEMBERS ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR NEW OFFICES FOR US. WHEN WE ROUTINELY LOOK AT THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO I JUST DESCRIBED IN THE FACE AND WE SAY THEIR NEEDS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE IT MAKES ME WONDER WHERE I PRIORITIES REALLY LIE? I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE RESEARCHING OPTIONS UP PARTICULARLY FROM FROM THE MEMBER FROM RANCHO CORDOVA I KNOW THIS IS A PASSION FOR A LOT OF US IN THIS ROOM. AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE VISITORS ARE CONFUSED BY MULTIPLE FLOORS -- WHEN YOU GET OFF A ONE AND YOU'RE ON THE ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S IT'S ON THE OTHER AYE I'M STILL A YEAR AND A HALF AND? I HAVE A LITTLE CHALLENGE WITH THAT BUT BUT MEMBERS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN DO THE THE JOB EFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVELY WHILE WE'RE STILL SAVING MONEY AND I URGE. A NO VOTE ON THIS THANK YOU. MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I SO I'VE HAD LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM RANCHO CORDOVA CORDOVA ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND IT IS A GOOD PROJECT AND I THINK. THERE'S CERTAINLY AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR GOING THROUGH THE IMPROVEMENTS HOWEVER IT SEEMS IN THIS STATE THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN GET SOME SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS IF YOU'RE BUILDING A STADIUM. OR I GUESS IF YOU'RE RENOVATING THE CAPITAL SO WHILE WE HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE WHILE WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS WELL WE HAVE. PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS WHILE WE HAVE. BILL BECAUSE SEQUEL ALLOWS PEOPLE TO GO IN AND SHUT THE PROJECT DOWN ALMOST FROM THE FIRST DAY THEY ANNOUNCE IT. THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO EXEMPT ITSELF FROM THE SAME LIES THAT ARE SHUTTING DOWN PROJECTS IN COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE DESPERATELY IN SORELY NEED THEM. UP FOR THOSE REASONS I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. MR MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ON THIS RISE IN OPPOSITION THIS MEASURE WHITE TYPICALLY SUPPORTER SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS AND STREAMLINES. I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS SPECIFIC EXEMPTION [inaudible] MEMBERS. OUR STATE INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING. WE WE DON'T HAVE WATER. OUR ROADS OUR GARBAGE. AND QUITE FRANKLY AND THAT THE FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT LIVE IN THIRD WORLD CONDITIONS. WELL YEAH WE HAVE A BUDGET TRAILER BILL. IT'S GONNA BILL A SHINY NEW CAPITAL FOR OFFICE. WHY YET MY PEOPLE STRUGGLE? WE HAVE WATER STORAGE WE MUST BUILD. WE HAVE DANCE THAT NEED TO GET BUILT. WE HAVE CONVEYANCE AND THE NEED TO GET FIX. WE HAVE POTHOLES THAT NEED TO BE FILLED. WE OF HOMES THAT NEED TO BE BILLS [inaudible] BUT YEAH. WE'RE MORE CONCERNED. ABOUT OFFICE SPACE. MEMBERS I LIVED TWO YEARS ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ. OUT OF THE BACK OF A MILITARY VEHICLE. AND YOU GUYS ARE WORRIED. ABOUT THE SIZE OF OFFICES. ABOUT HOW NEW THE OFFICES. I HAVE FAMILIES IN MY DISTRICT THAT STILL. TO THIS DAY YEARS AFTER THE DROUGHT DO NOT HAVE RUNNING WATER. CAN WE GET A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THEM. CAN WE GET A SEQUEL EXEMPTION TO BUILD MORE STORAGE. WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD WE HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT. BUT HERE WE ARE TODAY. ANOTHER BUDGET ITEM ANOTHER YEAR FOR ANOTHER FANCY PROJECT. THE DOESN'T TRULY HELP. THE PEOPLE ARE STATE ASK FOR NOW. MR MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S KIND OF EASY TO TO TAKE A SHOT AT THIS -- EXPENDITURE YOU HEAR ABOUT IT WHEN THE BILL NEW CITY HALLS AND COUNTY OFFICE ADMINISTRATION IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES BUT THEY ARE WORTHY. PROJECTS WHEN THEY'RE IN OUR COMMUTER CROSS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THERE ARE THAT THERE THE PUBLIC'S HOUSE. AND WE KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST VISITED PLACES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE SEE SCHOOL TRIPS. WE SEE PEOPLE COMING UP HERE FOR LOBBY DAY. AND WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS THIS BUILDING. IS A DEATH TRAP IT'S A FIRE TRAP AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM. IRAN'S RICARDO THAT HAS OUTLINED FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS IT'S VERY VERY DANGEROUS NOT TO MENTION. ATA ISSUES ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GET AROUND FOR AND HEARING ROOM TO HEAR ROOM TO VISIT WITH THEIR LEGISLATORS IT REALLY. IS A WORTHY PROJECT IT IS BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR YEARS. AND FRANKLY IT'S A GREAT USE OF ONE TIME MONEY. BECAUSE LEGISLATIVE DEMOCRATS ATTEMPTED TO SPEND MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET ON ONGOING PROGRAMS LIKE HIGHER EDUCATION. EARLY EDUCATION HEALTH CARE. AND GOVERNOR AND OTHERS IN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS DECIDED WE SHOULD SPEND MORE MONEY ON ONE TIME PURPOSES IN CALIFORNIA AND THINGS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS IT MAKES SENSE THE CALIFORNIA. GUINNESS THE PUBLIC'S HOUSE IN A GOOD USE OF ONE TIME MONEY IN OUR STATE BUDGET ASK YOUR I DON'T THINK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY MR COOLEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I'M VERY VERY PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I LOOK AT THIS BILL THROUGH THE LANDS OF OUR GOVERNOR AND I SEE IN THIS BILL REALLY A NARRATIVE ABOUT JERRY BROWN AND HOW HE IS. APPROACH THESE PROJECTS ACROSS HIS CAREER. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE HE SIGNED A BILL BY A FORMER RULES CHAIRMAN LEON RALPH. AND THAT BILL PROVIDED FUNDING FOR A AS YET TO BE FULLY FLESHED OUT PROJECT TO REBUILD THE WEST WING. AND INCLUDED EXPEDITED PROCEDURES. BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DRAG OUT THIS PROJECT AND THEREBY LET THE EXPENSE RISE. SO THIS IS REALLY VINTAGE GOVERNOR BROWN THAT WE SHOULD MOVE FOR TO POP A PROJECT OF FIRST IMPORTS TO THE PUBLIC. AND DO IT IN AN EXPEDITED WAY. TO MANAGE THE OVERALL COSTS. THAT EARLIER PROJECT THE WEST WING. EVOKES SIMILAR DEBATE AT THE TIME IT WAS UNFOLDING. AND YET IF YOU SEE ANY DAY YOU GO OUTSIDE THIS BUILDING WHETHER ON A WEEKDAY OR THE SATURDAYS AND JUST SIT DOWN AND YOU WATCH PEOPLE APPROACH IN THIS BUILDING. WALKING THROUGH THIS BUILDING THIS PEOPLE'S HOUSE. THIRTY YEARS LATER CONTINUES TO MOVE PEOPLE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THOSE THIRTY YEARS HAS THE BUSES OF TECHNOLOGY? ALL MANNER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT OF BEEN WELCOMED AT ALL OF THAT ORIGINAL BUILDING HAVE MOBILITY DAY MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIRS OTHER SORTS OF THINGS. IF THEY COME TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE TODAY THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY NAVIGATING THE CORRIDORS. QUARTERS ARE JAMMED UP. THE BATHROOMS ARE NOT A COMEDY TO THOSE PEOPLE WHICH IS NOT RIGHT. SO THIS PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND THAT IS WHAT THE BUILDING IS ABOUT THIS. SYMBOL ON THE STAIRCASES THAT HANGS DOWN AS PINEAPPLE WHICH IS NAY EIGHTEEN SIXTY MESSAGE. ABOUT WELCOMING PEOPLE. THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT GETTING THE PARKING NOW FOR MEET OUR BUILDING WHERE IS A HAZARD. OPENING UP THE BUILDING SO THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR PEOPLE TO PASS WITHOUT JAM IN THE CORRIDORS. THERE FACILITIES IT WHETHER YOU ARE ABLE BODIED SEQUENTIAL SENSE OR MOBILE BECAUSE OF THE PLACE OF TECHNOLOGY DO YOU ARE WELCOME HERE. TECHNOLOGY THAT SUPPORTS OUR WORK. I CAN ASSURE YOU I NEVER WORRIED ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF MEMBERS OFFICES. IT'S HOW PEOPLE CAN IN IRAN AND IRAQ BUT THIS PROCESS IS PROCESS OF GOVERNANCE. THIS DELIBERATE OF DEMOCRACY THAT IS WHAT THIS BUILDING WILL SUPPORT. I AM FRANKLY MORE CONCERN ABOUT-OFFICES WILL OUR STANDING COMMITTEE STAFF. TO NOT BE A BLOCK AWAY FROM THEIR CHAIRS BUT BE BACK AT THE BUILDING WHERE THEY WILL STRENGTHEN OUR POLICY PROCESS [inaudible] SO ARM. THAT THE FINAL THING I JUST WANT TO NOTE IS. SOMETIMES ON THIS FOR WE FEEL VEXED BY THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN VERY STRONG GOVERNOR [inaudible] OUTSTANDING GOVERNOR. WE CAN SUMMARIZE FEEL WE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH THIS GOVERNOR BUT THIS ANNEX PROJECT WAS STUDIED THE BRICKS AND MORTAR BUILDING. FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR BRICKS AND MORTAR BUILDING. WHEN DID YOU ASKED DOES THEIR CALCULATION FACTORED IN FURNISHED SEEMS? ESCALATING COSTS CONTINUE TO USE OTHER SORTS OF THINGS THEY GET UP. TO SEVEN FIFTY FIVE WHAT'S IN THIS BILL. IS CASH MONEY. WELL WHAT THE BUDGET WE HAVE CASH MONEY FOR THAT NUMBER. SEVEN FIFTY FIVE BUT GOVERNOR BROWN HAS ALSO PROVIDED. ADDITIONAL BOND FINANCES STRICTLY AS AN ALTERNATIVE IN THAT SAME NUMBER AMOUNT IT'S NOT A BILLION AND A HALF. SEVEN FIFTY FIVE BUT JERRY BROWN WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BUILDING WHICH IS HE IS AUTHORIZED HE IS PUSH. WILL BE BUILT WILL BE BUILT EXPEDITIOUSLY. AND ALL THE FUNDING WILL BE THERE ARE NOT CONTINGENT UPON THE NEXT CHIEF EXECUTIVE CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK HE HAS EXTENDED HIMSELF GREATLY. TO CELEBRATE OUR ABILITY TO PARTNER WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. DO BILL A WELCOME THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE [inaudible] AND AWE [inaudible] I'M. HONORED TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THANK IMAGE COOLEY MISTER MAYES EUROPE THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBERS I JUST WANTED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS A MEASURE TODAY. OF OUR ANNEX IS AN ARCHITECTURAL EMBARRASSMENT. AND WE ALL KNOW IT THIS THE PROJECT DOES NEED TO BE DONE FOR YEARS WELL I DON'T LIKE THE COST OF IT. I'M AND OF COURSE THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION AND OTHER THINGS IT HAS TO BE DONE I ALSO WHEN I THINK OF THE CHAIR OF OF THE ASSEMBLY RULES COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF HIS HARD WORK. HE'S BEEN VERY METHODICAL IN THE WAY THAT HE'S PUT THIS TOGETHER AGAIN I URGE A YES VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES SEEN NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE [inaudible] MEMBERS VOTE. WE DECIDED THAT ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE CLARK WELL. CLOSE YOUR ROLE AND TALLY ABOUT ICE FIFTY FOUR KNOWS TWENTY ONE SENATE AMENDMENTS ARE CONCURRED IN. MEMBERS WITHOUT OBJECTION WE'RE GOING TO JUMP TO AB. EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE A. B.. EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE. HARPER READ. SOME LEGAL EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND ACTUALLY THE STATE GOVERNMENT MAKING A PREPARATION THEREFORE TO TAKE IT BACK TO ME LEGAL RELATED TO THE BUDGET. MISTER CHENEY MEHLMAN. I THINK MUCH SPEAKER A. B. EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE IS OUR PROPOSITION TWO INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. OR IN LAYMAN'S TERMS ARE RAINY DAY FUND. WHEN THE RAINY DAY FUND IS FULL ALL EXTRA REVENUE GHOST INFRASTRUCTURE THE BILL SETS BUT MECHANISM TO USE THESE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS? FOR THE FIRST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION GOES FOR STATE BUILDING PROJECTS IN MAINTENANCE. AFTER THAT HELP THE FUNDS GO TO RAIL MODERNIZATION PROJECTS AWARDED BY THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. AND THE OTHER HALF OF FUNDS ARE DEDICATED TO THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM. THE BILL ALSO MAKES CERTAIN APPOINTMENTS AT THE PLEASURE OF THE SPEAKER RATHER THAN A TERM APPOINTMENT. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. DAVE MUSTAINE MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER A PROPOSITION TWO WHICH WAS PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SAYS THAT ONCE THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT IS FULLY FUNDED THAT ACCESS FUNDS THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE BSA ARE INVESTED INFRASTRUCTURE. STATE GOVERNMENT CODE DEFINES INFRASTRUCTURE VERY BROADLY BUT IT USES SUCH TERMS AS LAND. HIM ROADWAYS NAM WATER CONVEYANCE. THIS BILL DEDICATES THE FIRST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING TO INSTEAD GO TO STATE BUILDINGS. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY QUESTION THAT THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA DID NOT INTEND FOR THAT MONEY TO GO TO STATE BUILDINGS. THEY INTENDED IT TO BE USED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THE BENEFITS ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CALIFORNIA. THINGS LIKE AQUEDUCTS THEN ROADS AND HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES AND DAMS. WE NEED TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT BENEFITS EVERYBODY TOGETHER NOT JUST STATE EMPLOYEES ARE NOT OURSELVES I URGE A NO VOTE. THEY MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS MEASURE. AS YOU ALL. ARE AWARE. UNDER CURRENT LAW. THESE EXCESS FUNDS ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS ALL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WITH THE BENEFIT THE STATE AS A WHOLE. INSTEAD THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO PRIZE OR PRIORITIZE CERTAIN PROJECTS [inaudible] OVER OTHERS. LIKE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. WHY CAN APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS IN A STRONGLY OPPOSED DIVERSION OF MONEY [inaudible] FIRST DAY. OWNED RAIL PROJECTS SUCH AS HIGH SPEED RAIL. SIMPLY PUT PROPOSITION TWO IF RESEARCHER FUNDING WAS NOT MEANT TO BE SPENT ON THIS PROJECT. I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE ARE. INDEED. VIOLATING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. WHO THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE VOTING? FOR DULLER IS TO GO TO A MUCH BROADER PACKAGES OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS MEMBERS. WE HAVE WATER QUALITY PROBLEM IN THIS STATE WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM IN THE STATE. IN FUNDING PET PROJECTS IS NOT THE WAY TO MOVE US FORWARD ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU MR MATHIS. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION AND CLARK WELL OPEN THE ROLL-ON MEMBERS VOTE. RESERVE ABOUT ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE. WHO DESIRE TO VOTE [inaudible] CLICK WELL. CLOSE YOUR ROLL TIDE THAT ICE FIFTY TWO KNOWS TWENTY FOUR SENATE AMENDMENTS. OUR CONCURRED IN. MEMBERS THIS IS A BE. EIGHTEEN THIRTY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY CORKERY. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN THIRTY BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND ACTUALLY THE BUDGET RESERVES MAKING APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET MISTER CHANG. THEY CAN WITH SPEAKER A B. EIGHTEEN THIRTY CREATES TO RESERVE FUNDS. THE FIRST ONE IS A SAFETY NET RESERVE TO SET AIDE FUNDS IN GOOD TIMES. FOR FOR SURE CASE LOW COST INCREASES ARE THE TWO SUB A COUNCIL BE CAL WORKS AND MEDI CAL. AND THE START WITH THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BALANCE THAT THE RESERVE MAKES SENSE SINCE DURING A BUDGET DEFICIT YEAR WITH THE ECONOMY IS GOING DOWN ARE FOR THE OBVIOUSLY THE MEDI CAL AND CAL WORKS CASELOAD WILL PROBABLY. BE GOING UP IN THE TIME WE HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY. A POOREST OF THIS RESERVE ACCOUNT I'VE MAKES A LOT OF THINGS DURING THIS TIME. OUT WE ALSO CREATING A BUDGET DEFICIT A SAVINGS ACCOUNT WHICH IS FIRST PROPOSED IN A BILL BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY CERTAIN SUB. SIX IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS RESERVE REPEAL HOLDEN ACCOUNT FOR THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY PREDEFINED TRANSFER. IF THE ACTUAL AMOUNT NEEDED TO FILL THE BRAIN DEFINED AS ONE SEVEN BILLION THIS FUND RETAIN HALF THE BALANCE THE OTHER HALF GOES TO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. FINANCE THE LA ON THE LEGISLATURE WORK ON THE RULES FOR THE DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS FOR BOTH RESERVES. OVER THE NEXT YEAR WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU TING MEASURE OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THIS TRAILER BILL CREATES TWO NEW BUDGET SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. THE STATE ALREADY HAS TO SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ONE THE BUDGET SAVINGS ACCOUNT THE BSA WILL BE FULLY FUNDED THIS YEAR. THAT ACCOUNT HAS A MAXIMUM BALANCE OF 10% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES. THE OTHER ACCOUNT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IS A SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A MAXIMUM CAP. HOWEVER STATE LAW DOES SAY THAT WHEN THE BALANCE OF THAT SAVINGS ACCOUNT EXCEEDS 4% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES. THAT WILL TRIGGER AN AUTOMATIC ONE QUARTER PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE STATE SALES TAX RATE. SO THE ONLY REASON FOR CREATING NEW TYPES OF RESERVE ACCOUNTS. IS TO AVOID GIVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA A SMALL BREAK ON THEIR SALES TAX RATE. I THINK IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE ANY YEAR THAT WE HAVE A NINE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS THAT WERE SEEKING TO AVOID THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF LOWERING THE STATE SALES TAX RATE. EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT. EVEN NO THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES ORIGINAL VOTE. MISTER DALY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. THIS IS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME. ADDING THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT TO ARE STATE BUDGET IS SOUND PUBLIC POLICY I BELIEVE. ESTABLISHING THIS ADDITIONAL RESERVE WILL HELP ENSURE WE ARE NOT FORCED TO MAKE SEVERE CUTS TO EDUCATION AND OTHER IMPORTANT PROGRAMS IF THERE IS AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN COMING YEARS. EVERY DOLLAR WE HOLDEN RESERVES WILL BE PRECIOUS IF AND WHEN THERE'S A NEED. I WANNA THANK THE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY MR TUNING OUR SPEAKER MISTER RENDON. AND THE NEW DEMOCRATS WHO WERE JOINT AUTHORS IN THIS EFFORT I URGE A YES VOTE. THANK YOU MISS DALY MR ACOSTA YOUR RECOGNIZE. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON TO OPEN A NEW SAVINGS ACCOUNT. WITHOUT YOUR YOU YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME YOUR YOUR SPOUSE ON THE ACCOUNT THAT SO THEY DON'T SEE IT THIS IS VERY CLEARLY AN END RUN AROUND STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES US TO LOWER INCOME STATE. STATE SALES TAXES -- TO OUR CONSTITUENTS IF WE HAVE THIS KIND OF MONEY IF THE STATE LAW SAYS WE SHOULD BE REFINING MONEY BACK OR CBO REDUCING SALES TAXES ON OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING WE SHOULD NOT BE OPENING UP. NEW SAVINGS ACCOUNTS TO SKIRT THE SKIRT CURRENT STATE LAW I OPPOSE THIS AND I I MEAN URGENT NO VOTE. MISTER GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND SOMEWHAT -- AS FAR AS THE THIS IS NOT THE REASON WHY WE WOULD OPEN UP LET ALONE BEING THE ONLY REASON -- BEING THAT IN THE LAST RECESSION THAT WE JUST ALL INJURED THAT SHOOK THIS STATE TO ITS CORE AT ONE POINT IT HAD A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. AND WE'RE NOT EVEN AT A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR RESERVE WHEN YOU COMBINE ALL THE COUNTS TOGETHER. I'M SORRY BILLION SO WE HAD A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT AND WE'RE NOT EVEN AT A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR RESERVE WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. SO I DO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB -- AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY BY CREATING AND FUNDING THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AND PRUDENT WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS TAX DOLLARS HISTORY ISN'T IT DID DEMONSTRATED THAT GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES. DO NOT LAST FOREVER AND SESSION IS GOING TO COME WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR CURRENT RESERVES ARE EVEN INSUFFICIENT NOW TO SEE US THROUGH. THIS MEASURE PUTS US ON A PATH TO CONTINUE TO SAVE MONEY SO WE ARE BETTER ABLE TO WEATHER THE NEXT DOWNTURN NONE OF US AND I REPEAT NONE OF US WANT TO REPEAT -- WHAT WAS SO DEVASTATING AND THE CUTS THE REQUIRED CHOICES BETWEEN EDUCATION PUBLIC SAFETY SOCIAL SERVICES AND HEALTHCARE THIS ACCOUNT WILL HELP US AVOID HAVING TO MAKE THOSE -- SEVERE CUTS AGAIN AND SO FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THEY WHICH GRAYSON MISS MELENDEZ. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR MENTIONED THERE IS NO NEED TO CREATE THIS FINE WE ALREADY HAVE SAVINGS ACCOUNT WE HAVE A RAINY DAY ACCOUNT. AND WHAT THIS DOES BECAUSE THERE'S NO CAP. THAT IS PUT INTO PLACE FOR THESE FUNDS IT MEANS AT NO TIME IN THE FUTURE WILL THIS LEGISLATURE EVER HAVE TO GIVE MONEY BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS. BECAUSE THERE'S NO CAP SO WEEK IS WHAT SAYING YOU KNOW THE YEARS CONTINUE WHERE WE HAVE. MORE OF A SURPLUS THAT WE DO EVEN THIS YEAR. SOCKET ALL THE WAY INTO ONE OF THESE FUNDS AND NEVER GIVEN BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE WE HAVE. SOME MENTION MADE OF OF PAINFUL CUTS IN DURING PAINFUL CUTS -- LOOK AT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW WHO ARE MAKING SOME REAL PAINFUL CUTS IN THEIR FAMILIES. THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME PAYING THEIR BILLS AND I THINK THEY WOULD LOVE. TO HAVE THEIR GOVERNMENT TO GIVE THEM BACK SOME OF THE MONEY THAT IS FAIRS IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IS WHY WE HAVE IT IT IS NOT OUR MONEY IT'S THE TAXPAYERS MONEY. AND RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR STATE WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE HOMELESS ISSUE WE TALKED AD NAUSEUM. ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS. ABOUT THE INABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO FIND A PLACE TO RENT THAT'S AFFORDABLE. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO ASK THE GOVERNMENT FOR HELP IN PAYING THEIR ELECTRICITY BILL BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO APPLY FOR HELP TO THE GOVERNMENT. IN ORDER TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. THE PEOPLE WHO GO TO EVENTS IN SOME OF YOUR MEMBERS DISTRICTS IN ORDER TO GET FREE SCHOOL SUPPLIES FOR THE KIDS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEM. THESE PEOPLE WOULD LOVE AB BIT OF MONEY. THAT WE WOULD GIVE BACK TO THEM BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY BELONGS TO THEM SO RATHER THAN US SOCKING IT AWAY FOR FUTURE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE PAINFUL CUTS. TO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THAT HELPED GET US REELECTED HOW ABOUT WE NOT DO THIS AND MAKE IT A AN OPTION FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE IT I URGE IN ABOUT. MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- ARE HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS ARE SRUGGLING IN THIS STATE AND IN MY DISTRICT I KNOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LEAVING AND THEY'RE GOING TO IDAHO LIMON ARIZONA THEY'RE GOING TO TEXAS AND OTHER PLACES ON SOME. REALLY HOT AND DRY PLACE HIS THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE GOING TO JUST TO ESCAPE THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN THE STATE. OF THE FACT THAT WE GOT SUCH A BIG SURPLUS CLEARLY INDICATES THAT WE TOOK IN FAR MORE MONEY THAN WE NEED OR ARE USING. AND WE WANNA FUND A LITTLE WAY INTO THESE ACCOUNTS THAT IN A WAY WHETHER THE INTENT WAS NOT TO CIRCUMVENT. ACTUALLY REDUCING THE STATE SALES TAX BY A QUARTER PERCENT. AND THAT'S PART OF OUR LAWS SO I THINK ARE HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS ARE BETTER ABLE. THAN BETTER KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT HOW TO USE THEIR OWN MONEY AND I WOULD -- ENCOURAGE SENDING IT BACK TO THEM RATHER THAN THE STATE FUNNELING AWAY I URGE IN THE OVAL. MR GRAY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THEY MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE. TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR. AND THE ARGUMENT PUT FORTH -- THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON. TO INCLUDE THIS ADDITIONAL SAVINGS ON THE BUDGET. THERE IS THE NEW DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS PUT FORTH PROPOSALS CREATE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT. AND THE PURPOSE [inaudible] FOR THAT WAS IT OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS WE'VE AVERAGED ONE ECONOMIC RECESSION PER DECADE. WE HAD A RECESSION THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES WE HAD THE DOT COM BUST NEARLY TWO THOUSANDS. MORE RECENTLY WE ALL EXPERIENCE THE GREAT RECESSION. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THIS BODY WAS MORE THAN THREE MONTHS LATE IN DELIVERING A BUDGET TO THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE OF FUNDING SHORTFALLS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE STATE WAS LATE PAYING ITS OWN BILLS BECAUSE OF A THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR CASH FLOW PROBLEM. THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE DRASTIC CUTS TO EDUCATION HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THE STATE'S NONPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S INDICATED EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED A RESERVE. AND AS MUCH AS TWENTY BILLION TO PREVENT DRASTIC CUTS DURING A MILD RECESSION. AND FORTY BILLION FOR SOMETHING MORE SEVERE. THE PROPOSED FULLY FUNDED RAINY DAY FUND IS JUST OVER HALF OF WHAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED. TO GET THROUGH A MILD RECESSION. SO EVEN TODAY MEMBERS WERE NOT SOLVING THE ENTIRE PROBLEM BUT THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP CLOSE THAT. SAVINGS GAP. SO THAT WHEN THE NEXT RECESSION HIT THOSE OF US SITTING HERE ARE FORCED CHOOSE BETWEEN GOOD EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN. OR OFFERING HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES TO OUR SENIORS. IT IS NOT A PERFECT PROPOSAL BUT IS AN IMPROVEMENT. I IN IS A GOOD IDEA TO SAVE MONEY FOR HARD TIMES IF THIS BODY CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN DO SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM. AND AVOID A CONTINUING BOOM AND BUST CYCLES THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING BUT UNTIL WE'RE THERE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT MAKES SENSE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER GREAT MR MATHIS YOU'RE RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS [inaudible] YOU KNOW. EVERY YEAR THROUGH WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THIS THREAT THE NEXT RECESSION IS COMING THE NEXT RECESSION IS COMING. THE NEXT RECESSION IS COMING. HOW WE MANAGE OUR STATE BETTER AND STOP THREATENING OUR PEOPLE WITH THE RECESSION? HOW ABOUT THAT? HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF TELLING HOME HEY LET'S CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT? THAT WE DON'T NEED AND HIDE THE MONEY AWAY FROM THEM. LET'S GIVE HIM A CUT. WAS GONNA BREAK. AND SO TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW AND THREATENING THEM EVERY SINGLE TIME THERE'S A RECESSION COMMON. WE OUGHT TO OWN UP TO OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN TO THE OATH WE TOOK IS LEGISLATURE'S AND MANAGE THE STATE BETTER OR TO ENSURE A BETTER FUTURE. INSTEAD OF THREATENING THEM IN MAKING UP THIS CRAZY LAND OF ALL THOSE FAKE ACCOUNTS. TO HIDE MONEY AWAY FOR FUTURE RECESSION THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY DO OUR JOBS WE WOULDN'T BE THREATENING EVERY TIME ASK FOR NO VOTE. MISS CABALLERO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- I WAS HERE. WHEN WE HAD TO MAKE THOSE UGLY CUTS? I REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE. AND IT'S INTERESTING TO MEET TO BE STANDING HERE TODAY. AND TO BE ARGUING OVER SAVING MONEY. I JUST SAY IT'S REALLY BIZARRE TO ME. BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT THERE'S NOTHING SECRET. ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT WHICH IS CREATING ANOTHER ACCOUNT AND AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WHO WE ALL TRUST AND BELIEVE AS A NEUTRAL. A OBSERVER OF THE BUDGET. AND WHO GIVES US RECOMMENDATIONS ALL THE TIME PREPARED A REPORT CALLED BUILDING RESERVES TO PREPARE FOR A RECESSION. BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT A RECESSION COMES ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WITH THIS BILL. IS LOOKING TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE. I WANT TO SAY THAT AGAIN TO SAVE AS MUCH MONEY AND AS POSSIBLE. AND WHAT THEY PREDICT IN THIS DOCUMENT AGAIN A NEUTRAL DOCUMENT IS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED BETWEEN. FIFTEEN TO THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. BETWEEN A MILD OR MODERATE RECESSION THE LAST RECESSION WE HAD. WAS NOT MILD OR MODERATE. IT WAS EXTREMELY SEVERE WE HAD NOT SEEN A DOWNTURN. IN OUR ECONOMY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN CALIFORNIA AND SO. MEMBERS THIS IS A PRUDENT APPROACH HE PROVIDES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT MONEY ASIDE. AND IN THE EVENT THAT WE HAVE AN UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE I COULD TELL YOU LAST YEAR. THAT ARE NATURAL DISASTERS CREATED A WHOLE BUNCH OF UNUSUAL OCCURRENCES BETWEEN FIRES AND LANDSLIDES AND FLOODS. WE ARE GOING TO NEED MONEY IN RESERVE. AND SO THIS IS A PRUDENT APPROACH AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THEY WAS CABALLERO MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE THANK THANK ME SPEAKER OUT MEMBERS [inaudible] I'M. LOOK WHAT IS IRRESPONSIBLE. IS TO RATCHET UP SPENDING AS DRAMATICALLY AS THIS BODY IS DONE. AS THOUGH IT LOS ANGELES TIMES COLUMNIST THAT MISTER SKELTON BRO NOT. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. THIS IS AN ON PRESIDENT ID EXPLOSION. IN THE SPENDING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO TWO HUNDRED AND SOME TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. WE SET UP A HUGE [inaudible] HI [inaudible] SPENDING. AND THEN SAY MY GOODNESS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REDUCE SOME OF THAT SPENDING IN. TOUGH YEARS. SO THE BAIT AND SWITCH HERE IS. TO RATCHET UP THE SPENDING AND THEN SAY WE'VE GOT TO HANG ON TO THE TAXPAYER MONEY. IN ORDER TO MAKE ALL OF THAT BIG SPENDING [inaudible] AW [inaudible] PALATABLE. DIDN'T IS THIS NOT SELF EVIDENT TO THIS BODY. I THINK THAT IT IS. AND AS A RESULT OF IT BEING SELF EVIDENT THE ONLY CONCLUSION WE CAN COME. TO IS THAT THERE'S MAJORITY. THERE'S GOING TO SEAL IN THE PERMANENCY. THIS RECORD HIGH SPENDING. AND THEN SUGGEST THAT THE TAXPAYERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CANNOT GET BACK ANY OF THEIR TAX MONEY AS A RESULT [inaudible] SECONDLY. WHERE DOING A HORRIBLE INJUSTICE TO THE WHOLE NOTION OF WHAT THE VOTERS GO TO THE BALLOT BOX TO VOTE ON WHAT PREVIOUS? UP LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED. IN OTHER WORDS TO DO THIS BAIT AND SWITCH. WE'RE GOING TO END UP DECIDING THAT. WHAT PREVIOUS LAW REQUIRED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO? WHICH WAS WHEN YOU HAVE SURPLUS IT GOES BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS. WE'RE GONNA CREATE ESSENTIALLY LAWS THAT BASICALLY SAY THOSE LAWS DON'T MATTER. ANYMORE. SO I WOULD JUST POINT OUT AGAIN THAT IF YOU RATCHET THE CEILING SO HIGH. WE WILL NEVER COME TO A PLACE. IN WHICH PRUDENT RESPONSIBLE. DECISIONS MADE WITH RESPECT TO TAXPAYER MONEY. YOU ONE A BLANK CHECK FOR THE FUTURE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. AND WE NEED TO BE WILLING AND CAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING THAT MANAGING. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST RESPONSIBILITY NOT SIMPLY BLOWING THROUGH EVERY EXPENDITURE HISTORY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GROWTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T GET ANYWHERE NEAR. TO THE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS SPENDING THIS YEAR. SO WHILE THE WHILE THE GETTING IS GOOD. THIS BODY RATCHET SET UP. TWO UNPRECEDENTED HEIGHTS. AMEND THEM SAYS. LET'S SAY FOR THAT RAINY DAY WHEN ALL OF THIS EXTRA EXCESSIVE EXPENDITURES. ARE. OUGHT TO OF A NATURAL COURSE BE MANAGED THROUGH. PRECISION AND PAYING ATTENTION TO DETAIL IN MAKING SURE THAT WE STORED THE TAXPAYER MONEY WISELY I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BECAUSE IT IS SELF EVIDENT WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. AND I THINK WE'RE BASICALLY CREATING AN UNSUSTAINABLE. THOUGHT PATHWAY OF SPENDING AND THEN TRYING TO USE THE NOTION OF SAVINGS ACCOUNTS TO SOMEHOW. GOT BACK FILL THE HORRIBLE AND EXPENSIVE DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SO OFTEN TIME REACHED. AND THIS BUILDING I URGE A NO VOTE. MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I WOULD NORMALLY SPEAK ON A BUDGET TRAILER BILL BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT POINT SOMETHING. VERY OBVIOUS OUT. IS THAT NONE OF US SITTING ON THIS FLOOR TODAY WORK HERE HAVING TO MAKE THE DECISION TO MAKE THE CUTS THAT THE PREVIOUS GENERATION OF LEGISLATORS WHO SERVED IN THIS BODY HAD TO MAKE. WE MAY KNOW SOMEONE I KNOW SOMEONE SOMEONE WHO SAT RIGHT HERE AT THIS DESK IN THE SAME POSITION THAT I AM IN TODAY. MY FATHER WHO HAD TO VOTE TO CUT. PROGRAMS HE FOUGHT FOR DECADES TO CREATE TO FIND ALL WHILE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AISLE FROM THE OTHER PARTY SENSE THAT HOW COULD YOU DO THIS. HOW COULD YOU CUT THESE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND ALL THIS MONEY IN ALL THIS FUNDING FOR POOR PEOPLE FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN'T SUPPORT THEMSELVES HOW DARE YOU BECAUSE IT WAS ALL ABOUT POLITICS A WASN'T ABOUT REALITY?% AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE A RECESSION IS AN INEVITABILITY IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT AND THAT MEANS MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES. AT THE RIGHTTIME AND THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT CHOICE THE RIGHT DECISION AT THE RIGHT TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THEY CALDERON MISTER DALLI. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I I'M ONE OF THOSE WHO DON'T SPEAK VERY OFTEN. BUT THIS DEBATE IS GONE IN A DIRECTION THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY HELPFUL. I GOT ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WHEN I CAME HERE. LAST JANUARY HOUSE MY OFFICE HOW MANY BILLS HAVE BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW. THAT'S I CAME INTO OFFICE IN JANUARY IT WAS. TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHO ARE 200-070-02200 SEVENTY SIX BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN THE HAD BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW FROM THE DAY I CAME ON THIS FLOOR. AND I WILL TELL YOU NOT. ONE NO ONE SINGLE BILLS HELP ME STAY IN BUSINESS. NOW I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT TEN BILLS. HAVE REALLY DESTROYED. MY FAMILY FARM BUSINESS THAT I TRY TO RUN UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE. I HAVE A TRUCKING BUSINESS I PAY A HEAVY WEIGHT USE TAX. NOW TAXES OPPOSED TO GO TO FIX ROADS YOU KNOW WHERE IT GOES. HE GOES THE GENERAL FUNDS BIGELOW THE GENERAL FUND FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS. A BILLION DOLLARS HERE THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO ROADS GOES THE GENERAL FUND PER OTHER PROGRAMS. IT WAS TAKING DURING THE TIME. THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST TALKED ABOUT WHEN THERE WAS NEEDED CUTS TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER PROGRAMS. BUT WE HAVE AN EXCESS BUDGET DO WE GO BACK TO TAKE THAT MONEY AND PUT IT TO ROADS NO WE DON'T. WE CONTINUE TO PUT IT INTO THE GENERAL FUND WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF ALL THE CASES THAT WE WERE. SENT HERE TO TAKE CARE OF AND HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. EXTRA REVENUE WE TRADE A SPECIAL BOND SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO EARNED IT. AND PIMP AND PAY IT THAT'S PEOPLE LIKE ME IN MY BUSINESS. I WAS SURE WINNER THAT THING WITH YOU. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY PLUS YEARS. I'VE BEEN RUNNING MY SEED BUSINESS THE PEOPLE FROM OREGON SHIP PRODUCTS TO MY CUSTOMERS. I SOLD THEM PER PRICE THAT'S I COULDN'T COMPETE WITH. I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED ME THEIR BIDS OUT TO BID ON THESE PRODUCTS. SAME EXACT VARIETY. AND I CAN'T COMPETE NAMA TELL YOU SOMETHING. WHEN I CAN'T RUN MY FARM AND I'M NOT HERE ANYMORE I'M NOT PAYING TAXES? AND NOBODY CAN RUN UP FARM LIKE I RUN I'M CRAZY ENOUGH TO WORK. TWENTY HOURS A DAY TO KEEP THAT FAMILY FARM RUN. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES ARE IN THE SAME PLACE I AM IN. LET'S SKILLED BUILD SOME TRUST BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THE BILL. IF WE'RE GONNA REYES ATTACKS ON A GIVEN THE MONEY BACK WHEN IT'S WHEN WE TAKE CARE THE OBLIGATIONS AND WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. THIS BILL IS HIDING MONEY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GET BACK. THAT TAX BREAK TO PEOPLE WHO PAY THE TAXES IT'S WRONG.

URGING NO VOTE. THANK YOU MITCH DOWLING MISTER TANG. BUT WHICH YOU MAKERS. I THINK IT'S QUITE INTERESTING OFTENTIMES IN GOVERNMENT WE'RE TOLD TO RUN. MUCH MORE LIKE A BUSINESS. AND IF YOU EVER HAVE. A FAIR. IN YOUR DISTRICT TALK ABOUT CONSUMERS AND TELLING. PEOPLE HOW BEST TO BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WAS. WHAT'S THE ONE THING YOU TELL THEM TO DO [inaudible] SAVE MONEY. YOU WOULD NEVER TELL A CONSTITUENT DON'T SAVE MONEY. DON'T OPEN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT TO GO TO THE BANK. SPEND AT ALL IF YOU HAVE EXTRA GUESS WHAT [inaudible] GIVEN BACK. WE'VE BEEN TOLD THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RUN MORE LIKE A BUSINESS. WELL IF YOU LOOK AT GOVERNMENT'S BALANCE SHEET. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BALLOT SHEET OF GOVERNMENT [inaudible] IT STICKS. BECAUSE WE DON'T SAVE ANY MONEY WHEN WE HAVE A RAINY DAY. SO I THINK IT'S VERY HARD TODAY THAT WE HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT RUNNING THIS MORE LIKE A BUSINESS. WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT A WALL STREET YOU LOOK AT THE BALLOT SHEET OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHY ARE BOND RATINGS ARE GOING BACK UP. BECAUSE WERE BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WE ARE SAVING MORE MONEY WERE ACTING MORE LIKE A BUSINESS [inaudible] YEAH THE PEOPLE WHO EXACTLY ADVOCATE THAT ALL THE ONES ARGUED AGAINST IT. TODAY WE'RE SEEING THE CALIFORNIA'S WE'VE HEARD YOU WE ARE BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WE ARE ACTING LIKE A BUSINESS WE'RE SAVING MONEY SO WHEN THE RAINY DAY COMES.
