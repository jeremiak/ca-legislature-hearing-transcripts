THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:57.768 region:rollup2
THAT'S FOR A VERY OBVIOUS

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:59.302 region:rollup2
REASON.

00:58:57.768 --> 00:59:01.204 region:rollup2

00:59:07.177 --> 00:59:10.347 region:rollup2
MILLION HONEY BEE HIVES IN THE

00:59:09.046 --> 00:59:12.682 region:rollup2
STATE DOING THE THINGS THAT

00:59:10.347 --> 00:59:14.551 region:rollup2
HONEY BEES DO. HALF OF THOSE

AND AND SONG WRITING.

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:25.695 region:rollup2
BIT OVER HALF OF THOSE HONEY

00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:27.097 region:rollup2
BEES ARE COMING FROM ACROSS THE

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:30.567 region:rollup2
COUNTRY INTO THE STATE OF

00:59:27.097 --> 00:59:31.301 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. AT SOME.

00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:33.403 region:rollup2
THE IT INDUSTRY A PICKUP

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:35.439 region:rollup2
BEEKEEPERS MANY MANY SMALL VERY

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:37.174 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT OPERATORS FROM ALL

00:59:35.439 --> 00:59:39.309 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ARM AND WE

00:59:37.174 --> 00:59:40.944 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE THE REACH TO

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:42.412 region:rollup2
THOSE OUT OF STATE PEOPLE TO BE

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:44.481 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ENFORCE ITS KINDA

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:46.583 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION PROGRAM. BUT WE'RE

00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:47.784 region:rollup2
HOPEFUL WITH THIS PROGRAM AND

00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:48.785 region:rollup2
PIPE REALLY KEEPING A FOCUS WITH

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:50.487 region:rollup2
A COUNTY AGRICULTURAL

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:51.988 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONERS OFFICES THAT WE

00:59:50.487 --> 00:59:53.623 region:rollup2
WILL BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:56.326 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT WHICH

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:56.893 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:58.628 region:rollup2
THE BEE KEEPERS THEMSELVES.

00:59:56.893 --> 01:00:00.430 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL OVER RECENT YEARS

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:02.332 region:rollup2
EVERY TIME I GO OUT AND SPEAK

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:04.367 region:rollup2
WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE WE

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:06.470 region:rollup2
HAVE AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:08.271 region:rollup2
THEFT OF HONEY BEE HIVES.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.739 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE VERY VALUABLE BULLET

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.475 region:rollup2
ALSO FOUND THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:13.076 region:rollup2
JUST PLACING HIVES.

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:14.277 region:rollup2
SPORADICALLY WITHOUT ANY

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:15.946 region:rollup2
COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL AT

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:17.581 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER OFFICE OR WITH

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.882 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE THE LAND OWNERS.

01:00:17.581 --> 01:00:20.717 region:rollup2
THERE IN AREAS THAT ARE

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:21.852 region:rollup2
CONFLICTING WITH PEST MANAGEMENT

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:23.753 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS ON NEIGHBORING

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:25.155 region:rollup2
GROUNDS SO THE REGISTRATION

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:26.389 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS VERY KEY FOR US ON

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:27.524 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:29.960 region:rollup2
WE ALSO WANT TO USE THIS

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:31.962 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AS A WAY TO MAP OUT

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.930 region:rollup2
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:35.232 region:rollup2
ENHANCE FORAGING OPPORTUNITIES

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.700 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HONEY BEES

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:39.336 region:rollup2
HAVE GOOD NUTRITION WHILE THEY

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:40.904 region:rollup2
ARE IN OUR STATE. AS WELL AS WE

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:42.772 region:rollup2
THINK THIS WILL HELP US ALSO

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:44.374 region:rollup2
IMPROVE FORAGING OPPORTUNITIES

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:45.575 region:rollup2
FOR NATIVE POLLINATOR HABITAT.

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:47.978 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:49.312 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE P.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:51.014 region:rollup2
SAFE PROGRAM TO MEDICAL THROUGH

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:52.382 region:rollup2

FOR I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GO

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:56.353 region:rollup2
THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT TO TAKE

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:57.087 region:rollup2
A BREATH BECAUSE I DO HAVE A

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:58.421 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT.

01:00:57.087 --> 01:01:00.724 region:rollup2

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:02.192 region:rollup2
THAT IS THERE'S A. A.

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:04.094 region:rollup2

THE.

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:11.535 region:rollup2
OF FUNDA I THINK THAT WOULD

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.436 region:rollup2
ANNOYED WHEN THE WRONG TERM ON

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:20.944 region:rollup2

TO THE COST TO OPERATE THIS

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.052 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT.

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:30.921 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO BE IT SHOULD BE

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.655 region:rollup2

THE POPULATION OF BEES COMING

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:40.463 region:rollup2
FROM BEE KEEPERS OUT OF STATE

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:41.431 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:44.200 region:rollup2
PRESS AND WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:44.935 region:rollup2
STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO ASSESS.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.770 region:rollup2
THE AT THIS MOMENT.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:50.373 region:rollup2
OKAY.

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE THINK

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:26.269 region:rollup2
THAT THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES A

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:27.804 region:rollup2
BROAD PUBLIC BENEFIT SO WE THINK

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:29.305 region:rollup2
IT'S APPROPRIATE TO. FUND A

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.675 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WITH ONGOING GENERAL

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:32.809 region:rollup2
FUND OF IT IN ADDITION TO

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:33.977 region:rollup2
PROVIDING LIMITED TERM FUNDING

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.612 region:rollup2
MAY POSE CHALLENGES FOR THE

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:38.014 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF AND TRYING TO FILL

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:38.882 region:rollup2
THE POSITIONS. IT IN A. SO

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:41.084 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING THAT.

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:42.952 region:rollup2
ONE YEAR FUNDING WOULD HAVE

01:03:41.084 --> 01:03:44.287 region:rollup2
THAT TO.

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:45.689 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT AN INTERN FUNDING I

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:46.589 region:rollup2
THINK AS WITH AL ALL OF THE

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:47.524 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS.

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:48.958 region:rollup2
MAY MAKE IT HARD FOR THE

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:50.493 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO FILL THE POSITIONS

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:52.062 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE MAIN. POINT IS

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:54.731 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:56.199 region:rollup2

.

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:10.847 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:13.783 region:rollup2
AND MANY IF.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:15.985 region:rollup2
IF TO THE EXTENT THAT IT.

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:17.821 region:rollup2
RESULTS AND WORKLOAD THAT MIGHT

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:18.321 region:rollup2
NOT BE OBSERVABLE WE WOULD HAVE

01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:21.391 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:23.159 region:rollup2
I THINK. THAT. IF A IF THE

DEPARTMENT HAS THE.

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:26.763 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO.

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:28.832 region:rollup2
DO THAT WITHIN EXISTING

RESOURCES WELL WE DON'T

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:33.269 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY HAVE CONCERNS BUT.

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:34.771 region:rollup2

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:36.940 region:rollup2
.

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:38.641 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORT THE A PROPOSED%

SHORT SO THE NEXT ONE.

01:04:48.785 --> 01:04:53.223 region:rollup2
IS AS DEALING WITH OUR PLIGHT

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:55.325 region:rollup2
BORDER PROTECTION STATION.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:56.693 region:rollup2
UMP THE PROPOSAL REQUEST NINE

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.627 region:rollup2
MILLION THREE HUNDRED FORTY

THIS IS ON INTERSTATE TEN.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:14.544 region:rollup2
INTERSTATE TEN IS THE MAIN

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:17.046 region:rollup2
FREEWAY THAT CONNECTS THE PORTS

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:18.648 region:rollup2

MISSISSIPPI ALABAMA AND FLORIDA.

01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:25.455 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A MAJOR TRADE QUARTER

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:27.957 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS HEAVY TOURISM

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:29.859 region:rollup2

CROWS. ON BUT IT IS A VERY LABOR

01:08:28.605 --> 01:08:32.942 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE PROGRAM OF SURVEYING

01:08:31.074 --> 01:08:34.711 region:rollup2
FOR THE DISEASE ITSELF. AND IT

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:36.512 region:rollup2
HAS INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY THE

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:38.247 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD FOR LABORATORIES DOING

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:40.483 region:rollup2
THE DIAGNOSTICS TO RUN THAT

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:41.784 region:rollup2
DISEASE. IDENTIFICATION PROCESS

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:44.921 region:rollup2
AND THEN BEING ABLE TO TAKE THE

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:46.522 region:rollup2
ACTIONS TO PULL THOSE TREES OUT.

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:48.858 region:rollup2
SO IT HAS INCREASED IT IS AN

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:50.727 region:rollup2
EVOLVING PROGRAM BUT WE BELIEVE

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:51.961 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THIS PROPOSAL OF TWO

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:53.563 region:rollup2
AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:55.198 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND IN ADDITION TO TWO

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:57.166 region:rollup2
AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. FROM

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:59.168 region:rollup2
THE AD FUND THAT WE WILL HAVE

01:08:57.166 --> 01:09:02.071 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO CONTINUE

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:04.107 region:rollup2
TO. FIGHT THE PROGRAM THAT HAS

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:05.074 region:rollup2
BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO FAR WE ARE

01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:06.542 region:rollup2
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:08.378 region:rollup2
CITRUS.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:10.346 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND DOING ITS

01:09:08.378 --> 01:09:11.981 region:rollup2
STRATEGIC PLAN THAT HAS FACTORED

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:14.117 region:rollup2
IN THIS NEW FINDING AT THE

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:15.518 region:rollup2
DISEASE AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:17.153 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT MIGHT NEED SOME

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:19.188 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR PROGRAM GOING

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:21.824 region:rollup2
FORWARD. ON IT'S AN INTENSIVE

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:23.793 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IT'S REQUIRING A LOT OF

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:25.261 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY ITS IN

01:09:23.793 --> 01:09:26.729 region:rollup2
PINK.

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.964 region:rollup2
CREASING THE LOAD ON OUR

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.232 region:rollup2
LABORATORIES TO BE ABLE TO RUN

01:09:27.964 --> 01:09:30.433 region:rollup2
ALL THE DIAGNOSTICS THAT WERE

01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:31.934 region:rollup2
DOING THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:33.536 region:rollup2
OF THAT.

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:35.071 region:rollup2

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:41.444 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE RESEARCH WHAT ARE

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:44.113 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO THE

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:46.115 region:rollup2
US WE DON'T YET HAVE THEM. BUT I

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:47.650 region:rollup2
BELIEVE BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:49.519 region:rollup2
AND THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:50.686 region:rollup2

RESEARCH DOLLARS AND THE RIGHT

01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:57.226 region:rollup2
KINDS OF THINGS WE NEED MORE

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:59.362 region:rollup2
EARLY DETECTION TOOLS TO ASSIST

01:09:57.226 --> 01:10:00.997 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY OF MAKING THEIR OWN

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:03.266 region:rollup2

ADDITION TO RESEARCH TO IMPROVE

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:06.402 region:rollup2
THE PARIETALS THAT ARE BEING

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:07.603 region:rollup2
OFFERED THAT WILL BE RESISTANT

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:09.338 region:rollup2

S. LOOKING A FISH AND GAME LAND

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:48.284 region:rollup2
FISH WILDLIFE PLAN IS NOT

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.286 region:rollup2
ENOUGH.

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:52.455 region:rollup2
CONTINUED LOOK ON OUR OWN FARMS

01:14:50.286 --> 01:14:54.423 region:rollup2
FOR SOLUTIONS AYE WE SEE IS THE

01:14:52.455 --> 01:14:54.990 region:rollup2
A RIPE AREA FOR INVESTMENT.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:57.426 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARGUMENTS AND ITEM

01:14:54.990 --> 01:15:01.364 region:rollup2

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:19.148 region:rollup2

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:21.317 region:rollup2
THAT WE MIGHT USE TOOLS THAT DO

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:22.785 region:rollup2
MORE HARM THAN GOOD AND ONE OF

01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:25.187 region:rollup2

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:33.429 region:rollup2
IT WAS MEANT TO BE SLATED FOR

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.564 region:rollup2

I THINK THAT'S VERY VERY

01:29:30.265 --> 01:29:35.537 region:rollup2

01:29:45.447 --> 01:29:49.084 region:rollup2
THERE

01:29:47.082 --> 01:29:50.919 region:rollup2
DISCRETION AS TO WHEN

01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:53.121 region:rollup2
ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD BE USED AND

01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:55.323 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED.

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:55.857 region:rollup2

THE LANGUAGE AND SB TWENTY

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:59.694 region:rollup2
SEVEN.

01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:01.496 region:rollup2
LEAVES THAT DISCRETION WITH THE

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:03.465 region:rollup2
VETERINARIANS IT PROVIDES

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:03.932 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE IT PROHIBITS THE USE OF

01:30:03.465 --> 01:30:05.166 region:rollup2
ANTIBIOTICS FOR GROWTH

01:30:03.932 --> 01:30:08.069 region:rollup2
PROMOTION.

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:10.205 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES ALLOW THE VETS TO

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:11.973 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND CARE

01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:13.742 region:rollup2
FOR ANIMALS THAT NEED.

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:15.543 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CARE.

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:17.279 region:rollup2

ITSELF INTO THOSE MEDICAL

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:30.292 region:rollup2
DECISIONS WE THINK IT'S VERY.

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:32.027 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS FOR THE STATE TO BE

01:30:30.292 --> 01:30:33.295 region:rollup2
MAKING THOSE DECISIONS WE THINK

01:30:32.027 --> 01:30:35.463 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE

01:30:33.295 --> 01:30:37.732 region:rollup2

OR IF THERE'S RESISTANCE.

01:31:09.164 --> 01:31:12.901 region:rollup2
WE NEED.

MORE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:31:12.901 --> 01:31:15.337 region:rollup2

ONGOING AND AND ARE NOT NEW.

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:54.496 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:56.865 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THAT SB TWENTY

01:33:54.496 --> 01:33:58.766 region:rollup2

I MENTIONED AT THE VERY END OF

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:15.857 region:rollup2
MY TESTIMONY THAT THIS REQUIRES

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:17.658 region:rollup2
A GREAT DEAL OF COORDINATION.

01:38:15.857 --> 01:38:19.794 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE ENTITIES THAT HAVE

01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:21.529 region:rollup2

BOARD OF PHARMACY'S I THINK IT'S

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:35.676 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:37.578 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY PLAYER THIS

01:38:35.676 --> 01:38:39.981 region:rollup2
IS WELL COORDINATED. OUR STATE

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:42.216 region:rollup2
VETERINARIAN ON HAS SOME IDEAS

01:38:39.981 --> 01:38:43.684 region:rollup2
ON HOW TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY

01:38:42.216 --> 01:38:45.286 region:rollup2
ON GUIDANCE WITHOUT GETTING INTO

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:45.853 region:rollup2
THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY THAT

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:47.722 region:rollup2
OVERSEES VETERINARIANS WE DO

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:48.589 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:38:47.722 --> 01:38:49.857 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT BUT.

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:51.125 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH

ALL STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE THOSE

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:54.529 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS BUILT. I ALSO

01:38:52.927 --> 01:38:57.031 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHILE YOU

HEARD FROM THE RANCHING

01:38:57.031 --> 01:39:00.101 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:38:58.432 --> 01:39:02.003 region:rollup2
THE POULTRY FEDERATION OF OTHER

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:03.905 region:rollup2
LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS.

01:39:02.003 --> 01:39:04.939 region:rollup2
ACCESS WAS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE

01:39:03.905 --> 01:39:06.874 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS HERE THAT'S ANOTHER

01:39:04.939 --> 01:39:09.043 region:rollup2
BALANCING THAT WERE REQUIRED TO

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:11.512 region:rollup2
MAKE. WE HAVE DIED LIKE YOU MEAN

01:39:09.043 --> 01:39:13.381 region:rollup2
ACCESS FOR THE ANTIBIOTICS WHEN

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:15.383 region:rollup2
THEY ARE NECESSARY AND WHERE

01:39:13.381 --> 01:39:17.485 region:rollup2
THERE ARE VERY RULED REMOTE

01:39:15.383 --> 01:39:19.587 region:rollup2
AREAS. BUT ALSO IMPORTANTLY

01:39:17.485 --> 01:39:20.655 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT ALL THE LIVESTOCK

01:39:19.587 --> 01:39:22.457 region:rollup2
PRODUCERS IN THE STATE WHICH

01:39:20.655 --> 01:39:24.458 region:rollup2
INCLUDE YOUTH WHO ARE AND AFFECT

01:39:22.457 --> 01:39:25.726 region:rollup2
THEY ARE FOR EACH PROGRAMS

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:27.261 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE ALSO

01:39:25.726 --> 01:39:28.930 region:rollup2
GETTING THE INFORMATION AND THAT

01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:29.630 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE ACCESS AND UNDERSTAND

01:39:28.930 --> 01:39:30.965 region:rollup2
THEY NOW HAVE TO HAPPEN

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:32.867 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED. THAT MARRIED

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:34.335 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP FOR THE CARE OF

01:39:32.867 --> 01:39:36.103 region:rollup2
THEIR ANIMALS AND FOR THE

01:39:34.335 --> 01:39:37.672 region:rollup2
LITERALLY THOUSANDS AND

01:39:36.103 --> 01:39:39.240 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:39:37.672 --> 01:39:40.741 region:rollup2
VERY SMALL.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:42.577 region:rollup2
IT'S EASY TO CALL THEM HOBBY

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:45.446 region:rollup2
FARMERS BUT THEY HAVE WEEKEND

01:39:42.577 --> 01:39:45.813 region:rollup2
SPRATT'S THEY MIGHT HAVE A HERD

01:39:45.446 --> 01:39:47.381 region:rollup2
OF TEN OR LAST.

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:48.783 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:50.184 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES OF

01:39:48.783 --> 01:39:51.652 region:rollup2
REACHING ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE IN

01:39:50.184 --> 01:39:53.054 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO ALL OF THOSE THAT

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:53.554 region:rollup2
ARE PART.

01:39:53.054 --> 01:39:55.056 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:56.591 region:rollup2
LIVESTOCK.

01:39:55.056 --> 01:39:57.992 region:rollup2
AND I JUST BOTH OF THE BALANCING

01:39:56.591 --> 01:39:59.193 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WERE REQUIRED TO DO

01:39:57.992 --> 01:40:00.628 region:rollup2
HERE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:39:59.193 --> 01:40:02.697 region:rollup2
FOR YOU TO BE AWARE OF JUST HOW

01:40:00.628 --> 01:40:03.764 region:rollup2
FAR REACHING THIS PROGRAM DOES

01:40:02.697 --> 01:40:04.565 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT HAVE AN

01:40:03.764 --> 01:40:05.833 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF.

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:07.969 region:rollup2
.

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:10.137 region:rollup2
OF WHAT.

01:40:07.969 --> 01:40:12.640 region:rollup2
IT MEANS TO AT MINISTER IN A

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:14.542 region:rollup2
REGULAR PATTERN.

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:21.983 region:rollup2
ITS ARE CLICK ON AN AREA THAT

01:40:14.542 --> 01:40:25.152 region:rollup2
SHE THERE'S DOCTOR JONES.

01:40:21.983 --> 01:40:27.321 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING.

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:28.356 region:rollup2
SO THE REASON THAT.

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:30.591 region:rollup2
THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT CAN

01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:32.827 region:rollup2
UP LOTS OF WAYS YOU COULD.

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:34.362 region:rollup2
INTERPRET RECORD REGULAR

01:40:32.827 --> 01:40:35.830 region:rollup2
PATTERN OF USE

01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:37.698 region:rollup2
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO

01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:40.334 region:rollup2
REMEMBER IS THAT.

01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:42.136 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE PRACTICING MEDICINE

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:44.071 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IS THE

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:45.606 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC ANIMAL ON THE SPECIFIC

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:46.908 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE PACIFIC

01:40:45.606 --> 01:40:48.776 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PATHOGEN THE IMMUNE

01:40:46.908 --> 01:40:49.977 region:rollup2
STATUS.

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:52.246 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW AS HUMANS WE

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:54.415 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ALL BEEN TO OUR DOCTORS

01:40:52.246 --> 01:40:55.550 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN APPRECIATE THAT.

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:57.952 region:rollup2
IN ALL MY.

01:40:55.550 --> 01:41:00.154 region:rollup2
MEDICAL COLLEAGUES IN THE HUMAN

01:40:57.952 --> 01:41:02.757 region:rollup2
MEDICINE FEEL WOULD PROBABLY.

01:41:00.154 --> 01:41:05.226 region:rollup2
FEEL THE SAME WAY THAT THEY NEED

01:41:02.757 --> 01:41:07.261 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:41:05.226 --> 01:41:08.262 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE VARIABLES WHEN THEY

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:09.864 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE A MEDICAL

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:11.866 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION ABOUT THE BEST

01:41:09.864 --> 01:41:13.034 region:rollup2
COURSE OF PRACTICE.

01:41:11.866 --> 01:41:15.670 region:rollup2
SO.

01:41:13.034 --> 01:41:17.505 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU ASK WHAT THEY HAVE IS

01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:18.940 region:rollup2
NOT JUST A QUICK ANSWER SO THE

01:41:17.505 --> 01:41:20.875 region:rollup2
WAY WERE THAT THE WAY WE'RE

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:23.711 region:rollup2
INTENDING TO ANSWER IT. IS

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:26.147 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR AND STEWARDSHIP AND

01:41:23.711 --> 01:41:27.915 region:rollup2
YOU JUST ISSUES PRINCIPLES WHICH

01:41:26.147 --> 01:41:30.751 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW THAT

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:33.321 region:rollup2
WILL BE MORE SPECIES SPECIFIC SO

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:34.956 region:rollup2
THAT OR PRODUCTION TYPE SPECIFIC

01:41:33.321 --> 01:41:36.157 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN PUT THOSE

01:41:34.956 --> 01:41:36.724 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES.

01:41:36.157 --> 01:41:39.493 region:rollup2
AND.

01:41:36.724 --> 01:41:40.628 region:rollup2
PARAMETERS TO CONSIDER IN THEIR

01:41:39.493 --> 01:41:42.997 region:rollup2
IN AGAIN WERE REALLY JUST

01:41:40.628 --> 01:41:43.164 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PREVENTATIVE USE

01:41:42.997 --> 01:41:45.299 region:rollup2
SO.

01:41:43.164 --> 01:41:45.833 region:rollup2
.

01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:47.001 region:rollup2
THAT'S A THAT'S A MINOR.

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:49.403 region:rollup2
.

01:41:47.001 --> 01:41:51.105 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:54.008 region:rollup2
WITH DUKE DID YOU DISHES YOU

01:41:51.105 --> 01:41:55.876 region:rollup2
SINCE STORESHIP PREVENTED IT USE

01:41:54.008 --> 01:42:01.182 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A VERY VERY MINOR. PART

01:41:55.876 --> 01:42:01.682 region:rollup2
OF THE PRACTICE OF VETERINARY

01:42:01.182 --> 01:42:01.949 region:rollup2
MEDICINE OR ANY KIND OF

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:03.117 region:rollup2

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:05.453 region:rollup2
I TAKE YOUR POINT.

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:09.724 region:rollup2
BUT AT SOME POINT THERE MAY

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:11.359 region:rollup2
STILL BE A NEED TO.

01:42:09.724 --> 01:42:13.361 region:rollup2
INTERPRET WHAT IS MEANT BY

01:42:11.359 --> 01:42:15.963 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING A MEDICALLY

01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:16.864 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. DRUG IN A REGULAR

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:18.833 region:rollup2
PATTERN HE.

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:20.401 region:rollup2
INTERACT AND YOU'RE RIGHT I WAS

01:42:18.833 --> 01:42:22.803 region:rollup2
NOT CLEAR ON THAT THAT'S MY

01:42:20.401 --> 01:42:24.405 region:rollup2
QUESTION OKAY HIZO DO YOU HAVE A

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:25.539 region:rollup2
POLICY ON THAT OR IS THERE. SAID

WHERE WHERE WHERE IS THE

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:29.443 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT ON THAT SO OUR INTENT

01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:31.846 region:rollup2
IS TO END QUOTE INCORPORATED

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:34.181 region:rollup2

GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS.

01:42:37.385 --> 01:42:40.888 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:41.455 region:rollup2
TOOLS TO HELP BUT CANARIANS MAKE

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:44.291 region:rollup2
THOSE DECISIONS AND ALSO TO

01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:45.993 region:rollup2
HELP.

01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:47.261 region:rollup2
PRODUCERS HAVE INFORMATION SO

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:49.397 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN BE THE SAME

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:51.732 region:rollup2

BE MAKING YOU KNOW. REQUEST THAT

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:55.736 region:rollup2
PROPS ARE INAPPROPRIATE DOES THE

DEPARTMENT SEE IT AT UNDER A

01:42:55.736 --> 01:42:59.340 region:rollup2
UNDER THE STATUTORY SCHEME OF

01:42:58.039 --> 01:43:01.876 region:rollup2
THOSE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:04.345 region:rollup2
TO THE DEPARTMENT SEE IT AS. ITS

01:43:01.876 --> 01:43:05.079 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSEE AND

AND FORCE.

01:43:05.079 --> 01:43:09.250 region:rollup2
.

01:43:06.914 --> 01:43:11.118 region:rollup2
ON ON THAT ISSUE SO I THINK I'M

01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:12.553 region:rollup2
GOING TO GET AT THE HEART OF THE

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:14.055 region:rollup2
MATTER THAT'S RAISED BY TWO

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:16.257 region:rollup2
SITES AND I. TAKE IT THAT THERE

01:43:14.055 --> 01:43:17.458 region:rollup2
IS A. CHASM BETWEEN THE TWO

01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:19.627 region:rollup2
SIDES THAT AND.

01:43:17.458 --> 01:43:21.762 region:rollup2
AND MOST SIDES FEEL THAT.

01:43:19.627 --> 01:43:23.798 region:rollup2
THERE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:24.932 region:rollup2
IS QUITE CLEAR. YEAH ACTUALLY I

01:43:23.798 --> 01:43:27.134 region:rollup2
DON'T I WOULD.

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:28.836 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY SAY I DON'T THINK

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:30.104 region:rollup2
THERE IS A CHASM WERE USING

01:43:28.836 --> 01:43:31.305 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WORDS BUT I THINK

01:43:30.104 --> 01:43:32.373 region:rollup2
WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MOVE IN THE

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:33.974 region:rollup2
SAME DIRECTION.

01:43:32.373 --> 01:43:35.176 region:rollup2
SO I THINK AS YOU SEE THIS

01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:37.278 region:rollup2
PROGRAM MATURE AND WE HAVE A

01:43:35.176 --> 01:43:39.447 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT WILL BE YOU KNOW DO

01:43:37.278 --> 01:43:40.781 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE NEXT YEAR. SO

01:43:39.447 --> 01:43:42.983 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:43.184 region:rollup2
TO SEE GRABS NOT RATHER THAN

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:45.052 region:rollup2
THAN.

01:43:43.184 --> 01:43:45.553 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:43:45.052 --> 01:43:48.055 region:rollup2
REF OFF OF MY USE OF OF

01:43:45.553 --> 01:43:49.957 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE.

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:51.358 region:rollup2
LET'S FOCUS ON THE LANGUAGE

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:52.827 region:rollup2
THAT'S ACTUALLY IN DISPUTE MAYBE

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:55.029 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A CHASM MAYBE IT'S A

01:43:52.827 --> 01:43:56.697 region:rollup2
VERY NUANCED DIFFERENCE WHATEVER

01:43:55.029 --> 01:43:58.966 region:rollup2
IT IS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF

01:43:56.697 --> 01:44:01.102 region:rollup2
OPINION AND MY QUESTION.

01:43:58.966 --> 01:44:03.771 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND

01:44:01.102 --> 01:44:05.172 region:rollup2
IF IF THERE'S AN ANSWER TO IS OF

01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:06.774 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THE DEPARTMENT.

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:09.677 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT IN TIME HAS A

01:44:06.774 --> 01:44:10.778 region:rollup2
PLAN TO ADMINISTER THAT

01:44:09.677 --> 01:44:12.646 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

01:44:10.778 --> 01:44:14.949 region:rollup2
AND AND AND AND DO SOME

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:16.817 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT IF ENFORCEMENT WERE

01:44:14.949 --> 01:44:19.720 region:rollup2
TO BE NECESSARY BECAUSE I. I I I

01:44:16.817 --> 01:44:22.690 region:rollup2
I I HEAR THE AGRICULTURE SIDE OF

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:24.291 region:rollup2
FOR THIS DEBATE SAYING LEAVE IT

01:44:22.690 --> 01:44:26.961 region:rollup2
TO THE.

01:44:24.291 --> 01:44:28.496 region:rollup2
THAT TO THE VETERINARIAN TO

01:44:26.961 --> 01:44:31.198 region:rollup2
MAKE A DETERMINATION JUST LIKE

01:44:28.496 --> 01:44:32.900 region:rollup2
IF I WERE TO GO TO MY PHYSICIAN

01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:34.502 region:rollup2
AND THE PHYSICIAN SAYS YOU NEED

01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.736 region:rollup2
AN ANTIBIOTIC.

01:44:34.502 --> 01:44:36.637 region:rollup2
WE'RE LEAVING IT TO THAT

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:38.639 region:rollup2
POSITION HOWEVER.

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:40.541 region:rollup2

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:43.310 region:rollup2
HUMAN DOCTORS AS YOU AS YOU PUT

01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:45.112 region:rollup2
IT DON'T HAVE A STATUTE THAT

GET TO A AT A REGULAR PATTERN.

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:53.587 region:rollup2
LEAST SWORDS I'M AWARE. OF.

01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:56.223 region:rollup2
AND SO WHETHER IT'S RIGHT OR

01:44:53.587 --> 01:45:00.060 region:rollup2
WRONG THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED

01:44:56.223 --> 01:45:01.095 region:rollup2
A LAW THAT IT CURES TO. A DROP

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:03.531 region:rollup2

SLOT.

01:45:17.478 --> 01:45:22.249 region:rollup2
BUT THE COLLECTION OF THE DATA.

01:45:19.814 --> 01:45:23.284 region:rollup2
AND THOSE USE PATTERNS WILL HELP

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:24.819 region:rollup2

DOES SEEM TO BE A GLARING

01:45:33.561 --> 01:45:36.230 region:rollup2
REGULAR USE THAT CALLS INTO

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:38.032 region:rollup2
QUESTION?

01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:39.667 region:rollup2

01:54:55.689 --> 01:54:59.659 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S AN

01:54:57.591 --> 01:55:01.695 region:rollup2
ISSUE WITHIN THE DTS SEE BUDGET

01:54:59.659 --> 01:55:02.529 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'D BE MINDFUL THAT AS

01:55:01.695 --> 01:55:05.265 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING THAT TO PROVIDE

01:55:02.529 --> 01:55:06.833 region:rollup2
FUNDING. OF BUT WE DO WANT TO

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:08.735 region:rollup2
CONTINUE FUNDING THIS PROGRAM OF

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:10.170 region:rollup2
THE AND THE BY GETTING THIS

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:12.172 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT ALLOW US TO TO

01:55:10.170 --> 01:55:13.240 region:rollup2
REALLY. GO AHEAD WITH THE

01:55:12.172 --> 01:55:14.775 region:rollup2
TRANSITION TALK TO THE NEXT

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:17.844 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AND TALK ABOUT

01:55:14.775 --> 01:55:19.613 region:rollup2
HOW THEY MIGHT WISH TO A FUND

01:55:17.844 --> 01:55:20.147 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE.

01:55:19.613 --> 01:55:22.015 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE.

01:55:20.147 --> 01:55:22.983 region:rollup2
IS A QUESTION THAT'S RAISED IN

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:23.350 region:rollup2
THE.

01:55:22.983 --> 01:55:25.585 region:rollup2
STAFF COMMENTS.

01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:25.986 region:rollup2
.

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:29.890 region:rollup2
USING SOME.

01:55:25.986 --> 01:55:31.792 region:rollup2
.

01:55:29.890 --> 01:55:33.427 region:rollup2
ELEGANT LANGUAGE. SAYING THAT

01:55:31.792 --> 01:55:35.695 region:rollup2
THAT TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL

01:55:33.427 --> 01:55:37.931 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT IS UNDER PRESSURE WHICH

01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:39.866 region:rollup2
I US SOON MEANS IT'S.

01:55:37.931 --> 01:55:40.801 region:rollup2
JUST ABOUT READY TO GO UPSIDE

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:42.369 region:rollup2
DOWN.

01:55:40.801 --> 01:55:44.971 region:rollup2
AND THE THE QUESTION THAT'S

01:55:42.369 --> 01:55:45.839 region:rollup2
RAISED AS IF IF THAT'S THE CASE

01:55:44.971 --> 01:55:48.675 region:rollup2
THEN WHY RELY ON.

01:55:45.839 --> 01:55:49.776 region:rollup2
ON THAT FUND.

01:55:48.675 --> 01:55:50.210 region:rollup2
OUR HOPE WOULD BE TO GET THAT

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:52.379 region:rollup2
FUND.

01:55:50.210 --> 01:55:53.747 region:rollup2
BACK AND TO A A PROPER BALANCE

01:55:52.379 --> 01:55:55.015 region:rollup2
IS THAT THERE'S A STRUCTURAL

01:55:53.747 --> 01:55:56.616 region:rollup2
IMBALANCE IN THAT FUND.

01:55:55.015 --> 01:55:57.851 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S FUNDING THAT

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:58.952 region:rollup2
WILL CARRY US THROUGH THE NEXT

01:55:57.851 --> 01:56:00.754 region:rollup2
YEAR AND.

01:55:58.952 --> 01:56:02.789 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

01:56:00.754 --> 01:56:05.158 region:rollup2
AT THE FUNDING FOR LONG TERM FOR

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:06.459 region:rollup2
THAT AT A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT. SO

01:56:05.158 --> 01:56:07.260 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WE CAN'T RELIED IN THE

01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:08.929 region:rollup2
LONG TERM.

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:10.263 region:rollup2
AND IF WE MAKE THE

01:56:08.929 --> 01:56:11.798 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION THAT THERE'S NOT

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:13.033 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO TAKE OUT OF IT AND

01:56:11.798 --> 01:56:14.467 region:rollup2
THAT THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THAN

01:56:13.033 --> 01:56:16.169 region:rollup2
WE WOULD CERTAINLY.

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:17.337 region:rollup2
NOT TAKE ANY FUNDING OUT OF IT

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:19.472 region:rollup2
BUT AREN'T YOU.

01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:20.974 region:rollup2
ADVANCING AT THE FUNDS

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:22.309 region:rollup2
INSOLVENCY IF THAT'S WHERE IT'S

01:56:20.974 --> 01:56:23.610 region:rollup2
HEADED BY TAKING MONEY OUT NOW

01:56:22.309 --> 01:56:26.079 region:rollup2
THIS IS THIS IS A VERY VERY

01:56:23.610 --> 01:56:27.214 region:rollup2
SMALL AMOUNTS AND AS I SAID WE.

01:56:26.079 --> 01:56:29.549 region:rollup2
WE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT

01:56:27.214 --> 01:56:30.250 region:rollup2
WOULD ADVANCE THAT INSOLVENCY IN

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:32.252 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM.

01:56:30.250 --> 01:56:35.388 region:rollup2

01:56:32.252 --> 01:56:36.456 region:rollup2
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATUS

01:56:35.388 --> 01:56:38.825 region:rollup2
OF THE ACCOUNT.

01:56:36.456 --> 01:56:40.827 region:rollup2

01:56:38.825 --> 01:56:42.996 region:rollup2
CAN'T TAKE ANY FINDING OUT OF IT

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:45.632 region:rollup2

02:01:02.756 --> 02:01:06.192 region:rollup2
ONLY VERY FEW STATE AGENCIES

02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:07.827 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A

02:01:06.192 --> 02:01:09.329 region:rollup2
DEDICATED ENFORCEMENT UNIT. OF

02:01:07.827 --> 02:01:12.665 region:rollup2
THIS WILL GIVE US SIX POSITIONS

02:01:09.329 --> 02:01:15.769 region:rollup2
FOR THAT A CORE TEAM TO ENFORCE

02:01:12.665 --> 02:01:17.403 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. OF

02:01:15.769 --> 02:01:18.838 region:rollup2
THE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:01:17.403 --> 02:01:20.340 region:rollup2
WELLS THAT WE REGULATE.

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:22.175 region:rollup2
IT ALSO GIVES US EVEN MORE

02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:24.511 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY IS THE CAPACITY TO

02:01:22.175 --> 02:01:25.979 region:rollup2
VERIFY COMPLIANCE WHEN

02:01:24.511 --> 02:01:29.048 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS ARE ISSUED AND THAT'S

02:01:25.979 --> 02:01:29.716 region:rollup2
FOR. A FIELD INSPECTORS TO THE

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:32.418 region:rollup2
B. C. B. INCLUDES TWENTY ONE TO

02:01:29.716 --> 02:01:34.921 region:rollup2
THE. NEW FIELD INSPECTORS. WE

02:01:32.418 --> 02:01:36.856 region:rollup2
COMPARED OUR CURRENT STATUS WITH

02:01:34.921 --> 02:01:39.225 region:rollup2
OTHER OIL PRODUCING STATES AND

02:01:36.856 --> 02:01:41.694 region:rollup2
WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVE FEWER ON

02:01:39.225 --> 02:01:42.762 region:rollup2
AVERAGE PER WELLS AND. A FEW

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:45.899 region:rollup2
INSPECTORS.

02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:47.567 region:rollup2
AND THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BRING US

02:01:45.899 --> 02:01:48.101 region:rollup2
ALL MORE CONSISTENT ALLOW US TO

02:01:47.567 --> 02:01:50.537 region:rollup2
MOVE MORE COMPLETELY. OUR

02:01:48.101 --> 02:01:52.472 region:rollup2
REVIEW.

02:01:50.537 --> 02:01:53.139 region:rollup2
SITES WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN

02:01:52.472 --> 02:01:57.310 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS.

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:59.546 region:rollup2
.

02:01:57.310 --> 02:02:00.647 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION.

02:01:59.546 --> 02:02:01.714 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE I

02:02:00.647 --> 02:02:03.316 region:rollup2
WANT TO EMPHASIZE WHEN I JUST

02:02:01.714 --> 02:02:04.551 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR POSITIONS THERE'S A

02:02:03.316 --> 02:02:05.518 region:rollup2
LOT OF THINGS GOING ON TO

02:02:04.551 --> 02:02:07.887 region:rollup2
IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO DO

02:02:05.518 --> 02:02:09.923 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS. ARE THIS INCLUDES A

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:11.591 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED DISPATCHING SYSTEM

02:02:09.923 --> 02:02:13.126 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE I CAME ON I WAS KIND

02:02:11.591 --> 02:02:14.260 region:rollup2
OF A RANDOM ACTIVITY WHEN YOU

02:02:13.126 --> 02:02:16.095 region:rollup2
DIDN'T INSPECTION NOT

02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:17.630 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY PRIORITIZING. WE NOW

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:19.999 region:rollup2
PUT GPS DEVICES ON OUR ALL OF

02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:21.301 region:rollup2
OUR FUEL VEHICLES WE DISPATCHED

02:02:19.999 --> 02:02:23.102 region:rollup2
TO THE NEXT OFFICIAL WHERE WE

02:02:21.301 --> 02:02:24.971 region:rollup2
CAN SO WE ACTUALLY GET PRIORITY

02:02:23.102 --> 02:02:25.738 region:rollup2
SITES. AS EFFICIENTLY WE CAN

02:02:24.971 --> 02:02:28.141 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE IN THE CENTRAL

02:02:25.738 --> 02:02:29.709 region:rollup2
VALLEY WORN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES

02:02:28.141 --> 02:02:32.178 region:rollup2
WHERE A TRAFFIC ISSUES ARE VERY

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:34.280 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING TO GET OUT TO SITES.

02:02:32.178 --> 02:02:36.349 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO BEEN WE'RE EXPLORING

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:38.918 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OTHER THINGS ONE IS TO

02:02:36.349 --> 02:02:41.354 region:rollup2
DO. RIGHT REMOTE ARE WITNESSING

02:02:38.918 --> 02:02:42.555 region:rollup2
OF TESTS ARE USING A GEO CODED

02:02:41.354 --> 02:02:44.090 region:rollup2
VIDEO CONFERENCING THIS IS

02:02:42.555 --> 02:02:47.227 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE'RE EXPLORING AND IN

02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:47.927 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE WHICH WOULD MAKE OUR

02:02:47.227 --> 02:02:48.461 region:rollup2
WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY.

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:51.297 region:rollup2
TO.

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:52.131 region:rollup2
FOR SOME TYPES OF TESTS. ARM.

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:53.433 region:rollup2
ON THIS SIDE AND WE'RE VERY

02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:56.436 region:rollup2
WE'RE COUPLE WITH LA

02:02:53.433 --> 02:02:57.003 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION THAT THIS ITEM

02:02:56.436 --> 02:03:00.073 region:rollup2
THAT WE BASICALLY.

02:02:57.003 --> 02:03:01.808 region:rollup2
WILL REPORT BACK ON THIS AND IN

02:03:00.073 --> 02:03:03.509 region:rollup2
THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

02:03:01.808 --> 02:03:05.478 region:rollup2
THE LAST ITEM AS I MENTIONED WAS

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:06.346 region:rollup2
THE I. T. PROGRAM. AGAIN IT'S

02:03:05.478 --> 02:03:08.581 region:rollup2
GOING VERY WELL THIS IS A

02:03:06.346 --> 02:03:10.016 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR ABILITY TO

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:11.618 region:rollup2
REGULATE OIL AND GAS IN THE

02:03:10.016 --> 02:03:13.186 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ON A

02:03:11.618 --> 02:03:14.754 region:rollup2
VERY ARCHAIC SYSTEM ACTUALLY A

02:03:13.186 --> 02:03:16.656 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WEIGHT WEIGHT BEHIND

02:03:14.754 --> 02:03:18.725 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES.

02:03:16.656 --> 02:03:20.493 region:rollup2
THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN. THE GOOD

02:03:18.725 --> 02:03:22.328 region:rollup2
NEWS IS FOR A MAJOR IT PROJECT

02:03:20.493 --> 02:03:23.997 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS AND I WOULD BASICALLY

02:03:22.328 --> 02:03:24.530 region:rollup2
FROM START TO FINISH. I WILL

02:03:23.997 --> 02:03:26.499 region:rollup2
HAVE IN PLACE WITHIN THREE

02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:28.201 region:rollup2
YEARS.

02:03:26.499 --> 02:03:30.036 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOW AT THE. LIKE I SAID IN

02:03:28.201 --> 02:03:31.104 region:rollup2
A FEW WEEKS WERE ACTUALLY

02:03:30.036 --> 02:03:33.239 region:rollup2
ROLLING OUT THE CORE OF IT.

02:03:31.104 --> 02:03:34.607 region:rollup2
THAT IT SYSTEM BY THE WAY

02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:36.175 region:rollup2
INVOLVES WE'VE BEEN DOING

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:37.977 region:rollup2
TRAINING WORKSHOPS WITH

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:39.612 region:rollup2
OPERATORS AND THE INDUSTRY

02:03:37.977 --> 02:03:41.147 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S AS MUCH THEIR TOOLS

02:03:39.612 --> 02:03:43.383 region:rollup2
AS OURS. ARE SO WE'VE BEEN DOING

02:03:41.147 --> 02:03:43.583 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY TRAININGS FOR INDUSTRY

02:03:43.383 --> 02:03:47.553 region:rollup2
BOTH.

02:03:43.583 --> 02:03:48.154 region:rollup2
OPERATORS AND OUR DEPARTMENT

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:49.622 region:rollup2
ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

02:03:48.154 --> 02:03:51.925 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE LAST ITEM.

02:03:49.622 --> 02:03:53.026 region:rollup2
LEE IS A. WE'RE DRESSED ARE

02:03:51.925 --> 02:03:54.694 region:rollup2
REQUESTING A REALLY SMALL

02:03:53.026 --> 02:03:56.429 region:rollup2
FINDING SUPPORT FOR TSUNAMI

02:03:54.694 --> 02:03:58.164 region:rollup2
HAZARDS MAPPING THIS IS A WE'RE

02:03:56.429 --> 02:03:59.832 region:rollup2
KINDA CALIFORNIA AS THE STATE OF

02:03:58.164 --> 02:04:01.901 region:rollup2
THE ART STAY THE OUR EFFORT IN

02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:03.636 region:rollup2
DOING THIS WHERE WE. LOOK AT

02:04:01.901 --> 02:04:04.938 region:rollup2
COASTAL COMMUNITIESAND PROJECT

02:04:03.636 --> 02:04:08.041 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

02:04:04.938 --> 02:04:09.008 region:rollup2
SIZE POTENTIAL TSUNAMIS. WHERE

02:04:08.041 --> 02:04:10.176 region:rollup2
WHAT COMMUNITIES AND WHAT PART

02:04:09.008 --> 02:04:11.811 region:rollup2
OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS WOULD

02:04:10.176 --> 02:04:13.479 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IMPACTED THIS IT'S BEEN

02:04:11.811 --> 02:04:14.847 region:rollup2
DONE IN A FEW US SEVERAL

02:04:13.479 --> 02:04:16.549 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ALONG THE COAST?

02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:17.583 region:rollup2
THIS HAPPENING I WILL ALLOW US

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:19.986 region:rollup2
TO COMPLETE THAT.

02:04:17.583 --> 02:04:20.520 region:rollup2
DOWN THE COAST AS A TOOL FOR

02:04:19.986 --> 02:04:22.956 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLAN FOR

02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.025 region:rollup2
DISASTER. SO WITH THAT ALLAH

02:04:22.956 --> 02:04:27.460 region:rollup2
WILL STOP AND HAPPY TO ANSWER

02:04:26.025 --> 02:04:28.094 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS WITH ME I HAVE.

02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:29.195 region:rollup2
I HAVE BEEN TURNER LEGISLATIVE

02:04:28.094 --> 02:04:30.963 region:rollup2
DEPUTY ALSO HAVE OUR ADMIN

02:04:29.195 --> 02:04:32.598 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR HERE IN THE AUDIENCE.

POINT MISTER PAUL.

02:04:37.337 --> 02:04:40.773 region:rollup2
I JUST. ONE QUICK QUESTION MAYBE

02:04:39.405 --> 02:04:42.175 region:rollup2
THE THE THE NAVY CAN CAN

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:43.910 region:rollup2
ELABORATE CERTAINLY THE

02:04:42.175 --> 02:04:45.845 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS OF YOUR.

02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:47.380 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAVE A VERY LARGE

02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:49.415 region:rollup2
IMPACT IN MY DISTRICT IN KERN

02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:51.017 region:rollup2
COUNTY AND I APPRECIATE THE THE

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:52.585 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK AND AND AND AND THE AND

THE ACCESS TO YOUR STAFF IN

02:04:52.585 --> 02:04:57.557 region:rollup2
TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION.

02:04:54.354 --> 02:04:58.224 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THERE IS A SIDE ISSUE

02:04:57.557 --> 02:05:00.560 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT RELATED TO THIS WHICH

02:04:58.224 --> 02:05:02.795 region:rollup2
IS. THE THE CURRENT BACKLOG IN

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:04.597 region:rollup2
pYOU COULD JUST PROVIDE A LATE

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:06.399 region:rollup2
THAT AN UPDATE UNSURE WHAT THE

02:05:04.597 --> 02:05:08.501 region:rollup2
CURRENT QUOTE CURRENT STATUS IS.

02:05:06.399 --> 02:05:11.904 region:rollup2
SO THAT I MEAN I KNOW AS WE

02:05:08.501 --> 02:05:12.939 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATED IS JUST MAYBE. IT'S

02:05:11.904 --> 02:05:13.773 region:rollup2
SO THAT WOULD

02:05:12.939 --> 02:05:14.273 region:rollup2
SOME CONFUSION AND THERE'S ONE

02:05:13.773 --> 02:05:15.675 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL

02:05:14.273 --> 02:05:17.343 region:rollup2
OPERATING OFF THE SAME DATA AND

02:05:15.675 --> 02:05:18.845 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SO YOU KNOW HOW MANY

02:05:17.343 --> 02:05:22.415 region:rollup2
TOTAL PERMITS ARE THERE

02:05:18.845 --> 02:05:22.415 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY BEING REVIEWED. WHILE

02:05:22.482 --> 02:05:26.586 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU CAN JUST PROVIDE ME

02:05:25.251 --> 02:05:27.987 region:rollup2
WITH THAT INFORMATION OKAY SO.

02:05:26.586 --> 02:05:29.655 region:rollup2
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF FRAME ON

02:05:27.987 --> 02:05:30.656 region:rollup2
THAT SO AND WE'VE HAD THE BACK

02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:31.991 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW FROM NEVER

02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:33.192 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS CONCERNED THAT WE

02:05:31.991 --> 02:05:34.861 region:rollup2
HAVE WE'RE TATE WORSE BEING

02:05:33.192 --> 02:05:37.163 region:rollup2
FEARLESS WHAT SLOWER THAN WE'VE

02:05:34.861 --> 02:05:39.732 region:rollup2
BEEN IN THE PAST. FOR ISSUING

02:05:37.163 --> 02:05:42.034 region:rollup2
NEW PERMITS FOR FOR DRILLING AND

02:05:39.732 --> 02:05:43.469 region:rollup2
YOU PROJECT PERMITS ARM. IS JUST

02:05:42.034 --> 02:05:45.438 region:rollup2
POLITICAL WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE

02:05:43.469 --> 02:05:46.873 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE

02:05:45.438 --> 02:05:49.475 region:rollup2
WAS CONCERNED WE WERE ISSUING

02:05:46.873 --> 02:05:50.576 region:rollup2
PERMITS WAY TOO FAST WITH AN

02:05:49.475 --> 02:05:52.378 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE REVIEW.

02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:54.514 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF LEGISLATION FOR PAST

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:56.082 region:rollup2
OR. IN IN ADDITION THAT WE'RE

02:05:54.514 --> 02:05:58.451 region:rollup2
OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE U. S.

02:05:56.082 --> 02:06:00.420 region:rollup2
EPA FOR LACK OF A PROPER REVIEW.

02:05:58.451 --> 02:06:02.822 region:rollup2
SO WITH THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS

02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:04.490 region:rollup2
WE'RE STEPPING UP OUR SCIENCE IN

02:06:02.822 --> 02:06:07.093 region:rollup2
TERMS OF REVIEWING NEW.

02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:10.029 region:rollup2
INJECTION PROJECTS FOR VIEWING.

02:06:07.093 --> 02:06:10.997 region:rollup2
WELL PERMITS THAT ADDITIONAL

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:13.032 region:rollup2
SCIENCE DOES TAKE MORE TIME.

02:06:10.997 --> 02:06:15.168 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THE

02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:16.636 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE IS VAST AND AND.

02:06:15.168 --> 02:06:17.804 region:rollup2
.

02:06:16.636 --> 02:06:19.405 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE A LARGE MUCH BIGGER

02:06:17.804 --> 02:06:21.474 region:rollup2
ROLE THE WATER BOARD TO DO A

02:06:19.405 --> 02:06:23.142 region:rollup2
SIMILAR MORE THOROUGH REVIEWS SO

02:06:21.474 --> 02:06:24.811 region:rollup2
THAT REVIEW COMES TO US ECHOES

02:06:23.142 --> 02:06:26.212 region:rollup2
THE WATER BOARD. IS SO THAT SO

02:06:24.811 --> 02:06:27.713 region:rollup2
THAT JUST INHERENTLY IS GONNA

02:06:26.212 --> 02:06:29.782 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE TIME TO PROCESS AND

02:06:27.713 --> 02:06:31.150 region:rollup2
THIRD. EYE IS THAT OUR

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:32.251 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:34.754 region:rollup2
AND I SAY NO THERE BUT THEY'RE

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:36.756 region:rollup2
BUMPS AND INEFFICIENCIES THAT

02:06:34.754 --> 02:06:37.590 region:rollup2
ARE MAKING THIS PROCESS EVEN

02:06:36.756 --> 02:06:39.425 region:rollup2
LONGER THAN IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO

02:06:37.590 --> 02:06:41.761 region:rollup2
BE. I EVEN WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:43.663 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS BUT ONE OF THOSE IS

02:06:41.761 --> 02:06:46.199 region:rollup2
IS THAT WITH THIS NEWS ENDEP

02:06:43.663 --> 02:06:47.600 region:rollup2
SCIENCE EVALUATION. IT'S

02:06:46.199 --> 02:06:49.035 region:rollup2
REQUIRING THAT WE GET A DAY.

02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:51.671 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND ADDITIONAL

02:06:49.035 --> 02:06:53.372 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM THE INDUSTRY.

02:06:51.671 --> 02:06:55.007 region:rollup2
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THE

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:56.209 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATIONS WITH INDUSTRY IS AS

02:06:55.007 --> 02:06:57.210 region:rollup2
IT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS THEY

02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:58.945 region:rollup2
GET ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR

02:06:57.210 --> 02:07:01.180 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. SO WE'VE TAKEN

02:06:58.945 --> 02:07:02.682 region:rollup2
SEVERAL STEPS TO TRY AND MAKE

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:05.218 region:rollup2
THIS MORE TRANSPARENT. ARE MORE

02:07:02.682 --> 02:07:06.119 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT FORWARD AND TO

02:07:05.218 --> 02:07:07.520 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE.

02:07:06.119 --> 02:07:08.554 region:rollup2
ANY INEFFICIENCIES AND MAKE SURE

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:09.522 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC

02:07:08.554 --> 02:07:11.057 region:rollup2
REVIEW.

02:07:09.522 --> 02:07:12.758 region:rollup2
WITHOUT EXTENDING THE PROCESS

02:07:11.057 --> 02:07:15.161 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE WE NEED TO. ONE OF

02:07:12.758 --> 02:07:16.095 region:rollup2
THOSE IS WE. HAVE PUT TOGETHER

02:07:15.161 --> 02:07:18.798 region:rollup2
AN ANIMAL YOU WITH THE WATER

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:20.900 region:rollup2
BOARD SET WE IT'S VERY CLEAR.

02:07:18.798 --> 02:07:22.335 region:rollup2
HOW WE RELATE TO THEM HOW WE

02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:24.137 region:rollup2
SHARE INFORMATION ETCETERA?

02:07:22.335 --> 02:07:26.672 region:rollup2
THE SECOND IS WE PUT TOGETHER

02:07:24.137 --> 02:07:27.940 region:rollup2
KIND OF A VERY CLEAR A CHECKLIST

02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:29.809 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IS ALL THE SCIENTIFIC

02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:30.943 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT THE OPERATORS

02:07:29.809 --> 02:07:32.512 region:rollup2
NEED TO SUBMIT SO THEY KNOW UP

02:07:30.943 --> 02:07:33.479 region:rollup2
FRONT AND HOPEFULLY MOST ALL OF

02:07:32.512 --> 02:07:34.847 region:rollup2
IT COMES IN AT THE VERY

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:36.015 region:rollup2
BEGINNING. AND THEY'RE NOT YOU

02:07:34.847 --> 02:07:37.917 region:rollup2
KNOW THE PROCESS ISN'T BEING

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:39.485 region:rollup2
DELAYED FOR THAT INFORMATION SO

02:07:37.917 --> 02:07:40.987 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE OF ALL THE

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:43.656 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING PERMITS RIGHT NOW.

02:07:40.987 --> 02:07:46.259 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE

02:07:43.656 --> 02:07:47.426 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN HELD UP. I DO TOO

02:07:46.259 --> 02:07:49.128 region:rollup2
WAITING FOR INFORMATION THAT WE

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:50.696 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:52.899 region:rollup2
FROM THE OPERATORS.

02:07:50.696 --> 02:07:54.367 region:rollup2
THE THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE DONE

02:07:52.899 --> 02:07:55.301 region:rollup2
IS WE'VE CREATED IN IN THIS

02:07:54.367 --> 02:07:57.370 region:rollup2
FRANKLY THIS IS DUE TO A LOT OF

02:07:55.301 --> 02:07:57.937 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW THE INPUT FROM THE

02:07:57.370 --> 02:07:58.204 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS HERE WE'VE HAD A

02:07:57.937 --> 02:08:00.273 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF.

02:07:58.204 --> 02:08:01.240 region:rollup2
.

02:08:00.273 --> 02:08:02.275 region:rollup2
RICHARD COULD MEETINGS IS THE

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:04.310 region:rollup2
WORD I'D USE BUT COULD MEET AT

02:08:02.275 --> 02:08:05.645 region:rollup2
YOUR CONSTRUCTIVE MEETINGS AND

02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:07.146 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE IS KIND OF A SIDE

02:08:05.645 --> 02:08:08.681 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:10.116 region:rollup2
WHERE ARE THINGS THE PROCESS YOU

02:08:08.681 --> 02:08:11.717 region:rollup2
KNOW AND FRANKLY THAT MIGHT LEAD

02:08:10.116 --> 02:08:13.653 region:rollup2
TO SOME DELAYS. WITHOUT WE'VE

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:15.788 region:rollup2
NOW CREATED ONLINE BOTH US AND

02:08:13.653 --> 02:08:17.256 region:rollup2
THE WATER BOARD IS A DASHBOARD

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:18.758 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU CAN TRACK THE STATUS

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:20.793 region:rollup2
OF THESE PERMITS AND WE'VE DONE

02:08:18.758 --> 02:08:24.030 region:rollup2
THAT SENSE. MEETING WITH

02:08:20.793 --> 02:08:26.832 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS A FEW WEEKS AGO.

02:08:24.030 --> 02:08:29.235 region:rollup2
I AM SO THERE'S ALL THESE THINGS

02:08:26.832 --> 02:08:30.570 region:rollup2
AND AND AND.

02:08:29.235 --> 02:08:33.005 region:rollup2
IT'S THE SAME TIME WE RECOGNIZE

02:08:30.570 --> 02:08:34.440 region:rollup2
REALLY THERE IS THERE IS. EFFORT

02:08:33.005 --> 02:08:36.208 region:rollup2
TAKING INCREASE EFFICIENCY

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:38.644 region:rollup2
HANDLE THESE THINGS FASTER AND

02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:40.913 region:rollup2
AND MOVING FOR NOT UNNECESSARILY

02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:42.682 region:rollup2
CAUSE DELAYS BUT I THINK THERE

02:08:40.913 --> 02:08:44.150 region:rollup2
THERE WILL IT'S NOT. AND I THINK

02:08:42.682 --> 02:08:45.484 region:rollup2
SOME FOLKS IS NOT IF IT IS A

02:08:44.150 --> 02:08:46.819 region:rollup2
SOUND LIKE YOU RECOGNIZE IT AS A

02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:49.288 region:rollup2
COMPLETE SEPARATE ISSUE FROM THE

02:08:46.819 --> 02:08:50.723 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF ENFORCEMENT. AND

02:08:49.288 --> 02:08:53.159 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE INSPECTORS.

02:08:50.723 --> 02:08:55.328 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IN IT IN THIS CASE

02:08:53.159 --> 02:08:56.128 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SO MUCH AN ISSUE OF

02:08:55.328 --> 02:08:58.130 region:rollup2
STAFFING.

02:08:56.128 --> 02:08:59.599 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY ISSUE IS THESE THESE

02:08:58.130 --> 02:09:01.100 region:rollup2
INITIAL SIGNS OF REQUIREMENTS

02:08:59.599 --> 02:09:03.536 region:rollup2
THE DISH OF STEPS THE PROCESS

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:06.539 region:rollup2
AND I WILL SAY SOME LACK OF.

02:09:03.536 --> 02:09:07.873 region:rollup2
OF COORDINATION US SO THAT

02:09:06.539 --> 02:09:09.075 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND PEOPLE KNOW WHERE

02:09:07.873 --> 02:09:11.210 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE SO THEY CAN BIRD DOG

02:09:09.075 --> 02:09:13.879 region:rollup2
AT THE RIGHT PLACE. SO THAT'S

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:15.948 region:rollup2
WHERE THINGS ARE AT I. TERMS THE

02:09:13.879 --> 02:09:17.683 region:rollup2
ACTUAL NUMBERS ON.

02:09:15.948 --> 02:09:19.285 region:rollup2
BEN TURNER CAN GIVE IT WHERE

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:20.753 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE SO THE THERE ARE A.

02:09:19.285 --> 02:09:21.821 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHTY SIX PENDING YOU I

IN THOSE CORRESPOND ABOUT EIGHT

02:09:25.091 --> 02:09:28.761 region:rollup2
HUNDRED INJECTORS I'M NOT

02:09:26.392 --> 02:09:30.630 region:rollup2
EXACTLY SURE HOW MANY PRODUCERS.

02:09:28.761 --> 02:09:31.731 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WE DON'T

02:09:30.630 --> 02:09:34.800 region:rollup2

THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE FOR US

02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:43.242 region:rollup2
IS. IS THAT WHILE YOU'RE WHERE

02:09:41.807 --> 02:09:43.809 region:rollup2

EJECTORS I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE

02:10:00.092 --> 02:10:02.928 region:rollup2
HOW MANY PRODUCERS DOES

02:10:00.593 --> 02:10:03.529 region:rollup2

TURNS OUT AN ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT

02:11:15.034 --> 02:11:18.137 region:rollup2
OF THE UNDERGROUND GAS STORAGE

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:20.773 region:rollup2
ISSUE WHICH BLEW UP IN SOUTHERN

02:11:18.137 --> 02:11:22.942 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. AND FOR A ONE YEAR

02:11:20.773 --> 02:11:24.810 region:rollup2
DOCTOR BATTLED THIS LEGISLATURE

02:11:22.942 --> 02:11:28.781 region:rollup2
AND THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES LIKE

02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:29.782 region:rollup2
MYSELF. AND FIND A BECAUSE THEY

02:11:28.781 --> 02:11:30.616 region:rollup2
WERE IN THE POCKET OF.

02:11:29.782 --> 02:11:32.017 region:rollup2
THE OIL COMPANIES AND THAT'S THE

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:35.154 region:rollup2
WAY IT WAS YOU GOT YOUR PERMITS

02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:37.456 region:rollup2
QUITE EASILY INCURRING COUNTY.

02:11:35.154 --> 02:11:38.657 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IRONIC OR I DON'T KNOW

02:11:37.456 --> 02:11:40.326 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS HERE IS TODAY THE

02:11:38.657 --> 02:11:42.561 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING TO GET

02:11:40.326 --> 02:11:44.096 region:rollup2
DARKER TO WHAT THEY NEED TO BE.

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:45.898 region:rollup2
WORDS IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE

02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:47.366 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR FIRED. THE DIRECTOR

CONSERVATION THE HEAD OF A

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:50.403 region:rollup2
DOCTOR FOR TRYING TO DO WITH

02:11:48.901 --> 02:11:52.171 region:rollup2
THEIR DOING NOW WHICH IS GET ON

02:11:50.403 --> 02:11:54.840 region:rollup2
TOP OF THE INDUSTRY NOT IN A BAD

02:11:52.171 --> 02:11:56.776 region:rollup2
WAY. AS A STATE REGULATORY BODY

02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:57.877 region:rollup2
WITH ENFORCEMENT ASKING FOR

02:11:56.776 --> 02:11:59.845 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS

02:11:57.877 --> 02:12:01.380 region:rollup2
THAT SHOP ON OTHERS CAME CAME IN

02:11:59.845 --> 02:12:02.414 region:rollup2
AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THEN.

02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:04.450 region:rollup2
SAYING THEY'RE HOLDING UP OUR

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:04.984 region:rollup2
PERMITS THIS IS HURTING JOBS IN

02:12:04.450 --> 02:12:06.519 region:rollup2
KERN COUNTY.

02:12:04.984 --> 02:12:08.020 region:rollup2
SO YEAH IT TAKES A LITTLE MORE

02:12:06.519 --> 02:12:08.754 region:rollup2
TIME FOR THESE THINGS BUT DON'T

02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:10.356 region:rollup2
FORGET THAT THE BIGGEST

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:11.757 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE. ON THE RATE OF OIL

02:12:10.356 --> 02:12:13.526 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION THE STATE AND

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:15.528 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT TO MARKETS IS THE PRICE

02:12:13.526 --> 02:12:17.296 region:rollup2
OF OIL PER BARREL. NOT THE

02:12:15.528 --> 02:12:20.366 region:rollup2
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT SO NOW

02:12:17.296 --> 02:12:21.534 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CRYING FOUL. WHEN THE

02:12:20.366 --> 02:12:22.468 region:rollup2
DOG IS TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY

PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT. THREE

02:14:29.161 --> 02:14:32.164 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO

A REPORT TO BE CASTIGATED AS THE

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:41.106 region:rollup2
DEMONS I JUST THINK IT'S

02:14:40.072 --> 02:14:42.207 region:rollup2
IRRELEVANT AND IT SHOULDN'T BE

02:14:41.106 --> 02:14:43.809 region:rollup2

SOME POINT IN TIME BUT THE

02:14:57.623 --> 02:14:59.692 region:rollup2

.

02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:41.060 region:rollup2
I GUESS INFERS THAT THERE IS A

02:16:39.224 --> 02:16:43.495 region:rollup2
PROBLEM HERE THAT IT IS A SLOW

THE FACT THAT.

02:16:50.569 --> 02:16:55.808 region:rollup2
SOME PERMITS HAVE BEEN. TAKEN

02:16:53.472 --> 02:16:56.308 region:rollup2
VERY LONG TO IMPLEMENT. BUT AS I

02:16:55.808 --> 02:16:58.410 region:rollup2
MENTIONED BEFORE THERE'S

02:16:56.308 --> 02:16:58.944 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO

02:16:58.410 --> 02:17:00.979 region:rollup2
WITH A MUCH THOROUGH MORE

02:16:58.944 --> 02:17:02.948 region:rollup2
THOROUGH REVIEW THAT PART OF

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:04.450 region:rollup2
THAT TIME THOUGH WHICH WHERE.

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:05.918 region:rollup2

I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:18.697 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO TO DECREASE THAT

02:17:16.662 --> 02:17:19.798 region:rollup2
TIMELINE. WE'RE NOT HAPPY WITH

02:17:18.697 --> 02:17:22.000 region:rollup2
THE TIME WHEN OUR GOAL IS TO DO

02:17:19.798 --> 02:17:23.335 region:rollup2
A THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC REVIEW IN

THE QUICKEST TIME WE CAN DO

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:27.439 region:rollup2

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:40.486 region:rollup2
TAKEN SO LONG TO REVIEW. US SO

02:17:38.484 --> 02:17:42.154 region:rollup2

02:17:49.995 --> 02:17:53.265 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOURTEEN APPLICATIONS

02:17:52.264 --> 02:17:55.033 region:rollup2
DROPPED IT WASN'T THAT WAY YOU

02:17:53.265 --> 02:17:56.335 region:rollup2
KNOW AND BUT THEN WHEN YOU KNOW

02:17:55.033 --> 02:17:57.503 region:rollup2
YOU WHILE OIL PRICES ARE DOWN

02:17:56.335 --> 02:17:59.438 region:rollup2
THERE RISING AND AS SOON AS THEY

02:17:57.503 --> 02:18:01.406 region:rollup2
START RISING WE GET A LARGE SLUG

02:17:59.438 --> 02:18:02.708 region:rollup2
OF APPLICATIONS. SO PART OF THIS

02:18:01.406 --> 02:18:05.144 region:rollup2
IS IT'S NOT LIKE APPLICATIONS

02:18:02.708 --> 02:18:07.112 region:rollup2
FOR WOMEN AT A CONSISTENT LEVEL

02:18:05.144 --> 02:18:09.081 region:rollup2
THEY TO GO UP AND DOWN AND SO

02:18:07.112 --> 02:18:10.215 region:rollup2
PART OF IT AS. THEY CUT ME CAN'T

02:18:09.081 --> 02:18:12.417 region:rollup2
IT STARTED COMING IN A RAPID

02:18:10.215 --> 02:18:14.319 region:rollup2
LEVEL I AND.

02:18:12.417 --> 02:18:16.321 region:rollup2
AN INNATE AND THEN WHEN THEY

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:17.956 region:rollup2
START COMING IN WHEN OUR JUST

02:18:16.321 --> 02:18:19.691 region:rollup2
BEGINNING ALL THIS A NEW

02:18:17.956 --> 02:18:21.493 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC REVIEW OF

02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:23.695 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATURE ASKED ABOUT SO.

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:26.231 region:rollup2
I'D SAY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF.

02:18:23.695 --> 02:18:27.599 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LEARNING CURVE GETTING

02:18:26.231 --> 02:18:29.168 region:rollup2
THE NEW SYSTEMS IN PLACE OF

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:30.736 region:rollup2
VALUATION ONE THING THAT'S GONNA

02:18:29.168 --> 02:18:32.805 region:rollup2
HELP A LOT I MEAN FRANKLY WE'RE

02:18:30.736 --> 02:18:34.006 region:rollup2
STILL WRESTLING WITH PDS OF

02:18:32.805 --> 02:18:35.841 region:rollup2
SCIENCE OKAY SO.

02:18:34.006 --> 02:18:37.809 region:rollup2
WIND AS WELL STAR SYSTEM GET

02:18:35.841 --> 02:18:39.378 region:rollup2
SAND THAT AND AGAIN IT'S STILL

02:18:37.809 --> 02:18:40.979 region:rollup2
GOT ABOUT ANOTHER YEAR TO FULLY

02:18:39.378 --> 02:18:42.414 region:rollup2
GET ALL PHASE TEN. PUTTING BOTH

02:18:40.979 --> 02:18:44.082 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IN US WILL BE ABLE TO

02:18:42.414 --> 02:18:46.418 region:rollup2
SHARE EXCHANGE INFORMATION MORE

02:18:44.082 --> 02:18:47.986 region:rollup2
RAPIDLY ON THE SCIENCE OF WELLS

02:18:46.418 --> 02:18:49.955 region:rollup2
IN PROJECTS SO THAT WILL BE AN

02:18:47.986 --> 02:18:51.056 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THING. I WOULD SAY FOR

02:18:49.955 --> 02:18:54.960 region:rollup2
ANOTHER SEVERAL MONTHS THOUGH

02:18:51.056 --> 02:18:55.661 region:rollup2
WE'RE LITERALLY BEING GOING INTO

02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:56.295 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSITION FROM.

02:18:55.661 --> 02:18:57.829 region:rollup2
LIKE PAPER DOCUMENTS GOING BACK

02:18:56.295 --> 02:19:00.065 region:rollup2
AND FORTH TO REALLY HAVING MORE

02:18:57.829 --> 02:19:01.200 region:rollup2
THIS ONLINE SO NO I I MEAN WE'RE

02:19:00.065 --> 02:19:02.568 region:rollup2
NEVER SATISFIED WHEN THINGS TAKE

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:04.636 region:rollup2
A LONG TIME.

02:19:02.568 --> 02:19:07.506 region:rollup2
SO IT'S UP.

02:19:04.636 --> 02:19:07.739 region:rollup2
IT'S A NEW DAY A DAUGHTER AND A

02:19:07.506 --> 02:19:08.273 region:rollup2
BAD AND.

02:19:07.739 --> 02:19:10.542 region:rollup2
.

02:19:08.273 --> 02:19:12.477 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

02:19:10.542 --> 02:19:12.978 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE FACTORS IN THE EQUATION

02:19:12.477 --> 02:19:14.680 region:rollup2
HERE THERE'S THE MARKET

02:19:12.978 --> 02:19:16.215 region:rollup2
DYNAMICS.

02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:17.649 region:rollup2
YOU FOLKS ARE TRYING TO RESPOND

02:19:16.215 --> 02:19:18.650 region:rollup2
TO THESE MANDATES THAT WE'RE

02:19:17.649 --> 02:19:20.519 region:rollup2
PUTTING ON YOU.

02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:21.920 region:rollup2
.

02:19:20.519 --> 02:19:23.255 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT IT AND

02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:25.858 region:rollup2
THIS IS A GENUINE QUESTION HAVE

02:19:23.255 --> 02:19:28.427 region:rollup2
NO IDEA IS THERE OR SHOULD THERE

02:19:25.858 --> 02:19:30.128 region:rollup2
BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

02:19:28.427 --> 02:19:32.197 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF PRODUCTION WHICH IS

02:19:30.128 --> 02:19:34.032 region:rollup2
DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:34.566 region:rollup2
BUT THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION?

02:19:34.032 --> 02:19:36.702 region:rollup2
DOMESTICALLY IN CAL WITHIN

02:19:34.566 --> 02:19:39.338 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:19:36.702 --> 02:19:41.607 region:rollup2
AND YOUR STAFFING LEVELS IN

02:19:39.338 --> 02:19:42.941 region:rollup2
TERMS OF YOUR. ENFORCEMENT SO

02:19:41.607 --> 02:19:44.443 region:rollup2
THERE YOU KNOW TWENTY SEVEN NEW

02:19:42.941 --> 02:19:45.344 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

02:19:44.443 --> 02:19:45.978 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA BE STAFFING UP I

02:19:45.344 --> 02:19:49.414 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:19:45.978 --> 02:19:51.350 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY. I SUPPORT.

02:19:49.414 --> 02:19:52.885 region:rollup2
STAFFING UP TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

02:19:51.350 --> 02:19:54.453 region:rollup2
WE'RE MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS

02:19:52.885 --> 02:19:55.587 region:rollup2
THAT WE THE LEGISLATURE PUT ON

02:19:54.453 --> 02:19:55.888 region:rollup2
YOU BUT.

02:19:55.587 --> 02:19:57.789 region:rollup2
IS THERE AT.

02:19:55.888 --> 02:19:59.057 region:rollup2
.

02:19:57.789 --> 02:20:00.993 region:rollup2
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:03.228 region:rollup2
STAFFING LEVELS AND THE LEVEL OF

02:20:00.993 --> 02:20:04.696 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA WORSE

02:20:03.228 --> 02:20:06.131 region:rollup2
ARE THOSE TWO THINGS KIND OF.

02:20:04.696 --> 02:20:07.566 region:rollup2
NON LINEAR THOSE ARE ON THERE

02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:09.868 region:rollup2
NOT LINEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE

02:20:07.566 --> 02:20:11.603 region:rollup2
WHETHER IF PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE OF

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:13.205 region:rollup2
A REDUCTION APPLICATIONS ARE

02:20:11.603 --> 02:20:15.173 region:rollup2
WORK RELATED DOWN. BUT IF

02:20:13.205 --> 02:20:16.675 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S YOUNG THROTTLE BACK ON

02:20:15.173 --> 02:20:18.076 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH THEY'RE PRODUCING WE

02:20:16.675 --> 02:20:19.912 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE TO REGULATE THOSE

02:20:18.076 --> 02:20:22.180 region:rollup2
WELL HAS WHETHER THEY'RE ACTIVE

02:20:19.912 --> 02:20:23.548 region:rollup2
IN ACTIVE. WE STILL HAVE TO DO

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:25.517 region:rollup2
SEEMS INSPECTIONS SO THE

02:20:23.548 --> 02:20:26.818 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD FRANKLY FOR US WE STILL

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:29.955 region:rollup2
HAVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WELLS.

02:20:26.818 --> 02:20:31.690 region:rollup2
TO TO MANAGE AND REVIEW SO THEY

02:20:29.955 --> 02:20:33.759 region:rollup2
THE. THE WORKLOAD DOESN'T GO

02:20:31.690 --> 02:20:34.793 region:rollup2
DOWN UP AND DOWN LIKE THAT WHEN

02:20:33.759 --> 02:20:36.662 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION GOES UP AND DOWN.

02:20:34.793 --> 02:20:37.963 region:rollup2
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS I THINK WHAT

02:20:36.662 --> 02:20:40.299 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SOMEONE LEAN TO IS WHEN

02:20:37.963 --> 02:20:42.501 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION GOES DOWN. THE AMOUNT

02:20:40.299 --> 02:20:44.536 region:rollup2
OF COST PER BARREL. IN ITSELF

02:20:42.501 --> 02:20:45.470 region:rollup2
WILL GO UP A LITTLE IN THE FEES.

02:20:44.536 --> 02:20:47.372 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.607 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SO SO I

02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:49.975 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK IT IS THAT CONNECTED

02:20:48.607 --> 02:20:51.310 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT BECAUSE WE'RE STILL

02:20:49.975 --> 02:20:53.645 region:rollup2
HAVING TO MANAGE THE SAME NUMBER

02:20:51.310 --> 02:20:55.514 region:rollup2
OF WELLS AND PROJECTS. I IF.

02:20:53.645 --> 02:20:57.049 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION WENT WAY UP OUR

02:20:55.514 --> 02:21:01.653 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD INCREASE AS MORE YOU

02:20:57.049 --> 02:21:02.387 region:rollup2
KNOW MORE ADS STRAWS ARE PUT IN

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:03.255 region:rollup2
THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK.

02:21:02.387 --> 02:21:04.856 region:rollup2
SO I IT'S.

02:21:03.255 --> 02:21:06.658 region:rollup2
NOT THAT IT'S HIGHLY RELATED

02:21:04.856 --> 02:21:07.926 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S

02:21:06.658 --> 02:21:09.661 region:rollup2
GOING ON TO WELL WE STILL HAVE

02:21:07.926 --> 02:21:11.530 region:rollup2
TO REGULATE IT CHECK BLOWOUT

02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:12.597 region:rollup2
PREVENTERS INSPECT AMON ALL LIKE

02:21:11.530 --> 02:21:14.199 region:rollup2
I THINK. BECAUSE THOSE

02:21:12.597 --> 02:21:16.001 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS AROUND SCHEDULES YOU

02:21:14.199 --> 02:21:17.703 region:rollup2
KNOW TO KEEP THINGS SAFE NOT ON

02:21:16.001 --> 02:21:20.372 region:rollup2
WHETHER HOW MUCH THEY'RE PUMPING

02:21:17.703 --> 02:21:20.906 region:rollup2
AT A GIVEN TIME.

02:21:20.372 --> 02:21:21.640 region:rollup2
AND I WILL BELIEVE AT THIS

02:21:20.906 --> 02:21:24.910 region:rollup2
POINT.

02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:27.579 region:rollup2
ANYMORE MISTER CHAIR BUT.

02:21:24.910 --> 02:21:31.750 region:rollup2
MY.

02:21:27.579 --> 02:21:34.052 region:rollup2
UNEDUCATED NON EXPERT UP.

02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:35.787 region:rollup2
VIEW OF OIL IN CALIFORNIA FROM

02:21:34.052 --> 02:21:37.556 region:rollup2
WHAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT. THERE

02:21:35.787 --> 02:21:38.523 region:rollup2
WERE PROMISES OF LOTS OF

02:21:37.556 --> 02:21:40.192 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION WITH MODERATION ALE

02:21:38.523 --> 02:21:42.361 region:rollup2
BUT.%

02:21:40.192 --> 02:21:44.129 region:rollup2
AS FOLKS. YOU KNOW DID THE

02:21:42.361 --> 02:21:46.465 region:rollup2
FRACKING AND REALLY GOT INTO IT

02:21:44.129 --> 02:21:49.234 region:rollup2
IT SORT OF. DIDN'T REALLY

02:21:46.465 --> 02:21:50.969 region:rollup2
MATERIALIZE TO THE EXTENT THAT.

02:21:49.234 --> 02:21:52.838 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY HOPED LET'S PUT IT

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:55.040 region:rollup2
THAT WAY. IS THAT IS THAT

02:21:52.838 --> 02:21:57.008 region:rollup2
ACCURATE AS WANT TO KNOW THAT MY

02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:59.778 region:rollup2
OWN KIND OF FRAMING ON THIS. IS

02:21:57.008 --> 02:22:01.480 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY WHAT IS THE STATE OF

02:21:59.778 --> 02:22:03.648 region:rollup2
OF PRODUCTION.

02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:05.450 region:rollup2
FROM YOUR STANDPOINT. IN IN

02:22:03.648 --> 02:22:07.152 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND SORT OF

02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:08.653 region:rollup2
PROJECTING GOING FORWARD YOU

02:22:07.152 --> 02:22:09.621 region:rollup2
KNOW AT THERE WAS A MOMENT THERE

02:22:08.653 --> 02:22:10.756 region:rollup2
WERE PEOPLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE

02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:13.425 region:rollup2
NEW OIL BOOM OR SOMETHING IN

02:22:10.756 --> 02:22:14.860 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. IN BAND WHO IS MY

02:22:13.425 --> 02:22:17.162 region:rollup2
FORMER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR

02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:17.929 region:rollup2
KNOWS TONS MORE ABOUT THIS THAN

02:22:17.162 --> 02:22:21.233 region:rollup2
I DO BUT IT AND MY INFORMATION

02:22:17.929 --> 02:22:23.034 region:rollup2
WAS. FROM HIM BUT IS THAT STILL.

02:22:21.233 --> 02:22:25.237 region:rollup2
KIND OF THERE IS THAT THE STATE

02:22:23.034 --> 02:22:26.505 region:rollup2
OF AFFAIRS IN CALIFORNIA WITH MY

02:22:25.237 --> 02:22:28.106 region:rollup2
BREAK A BRIEF COMMENT IF YOU

02:22:26.505 --> 02:22:29.741 region:rollup2
WANT MORE I COULD ASK OUR CHIEF

02:22:28.106 --> 02:22:31.576 region:rollup2
DEPUTY OIL SUPERVISORS HERE BOB

02:22:29.741 --> 02:22:33.145 region:rollup2
MARLEY. WHO IS BASED IN KERN

02:22:31.576 --> 02:22:34.646 region:rollup2
COUNTY I MIGHT ASK CAN COME UP

02:22:33.145 --> 02:22:38.050 region:rollup2
BUT? GENERALLY IT'S FALLING

02:22:34.646 --> 02:22:39.184 region:rollup2
PRICE I MEAN YOU KNOW REGARDLESS

02:22:38.050 --> 02:22:40.519 region:rollup2
OF YOU KNOW.

02:22:39.184 --> 02:22:42.120 region:rollup2
WHAT TECHNIQUES ARE USED IT WHEN

02:22:40.519 --> 02:22:43.989 region:rollup2
PRICE WENT DOWN PRODUCTIONS GONE

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.790 region:rollup2
DOWN AND INVESTMENT GOES DOWN

02:22:43.989 --> 02:22:46.491 region:rollup2
NUMBER RIGS IN THE STATE GOES

02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:48.493 region:rollup2
DOWN? RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY NEVER

02:22:46.491 --> 02:22:49.628 region:rollup2
RIGGS IS GOING UP AND YOU KNOW

02:22:48.493 --> 02:22:51.129 region:rollup2
SO.

02:22:49.628 --> 02:22:52.097 region:rollup2
AND.

02:22:51.129 --> 02:22:53.365 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAN'T I

02:22:52.097 --> 02:22:55.634 region:rollup2
CANNOT I DO FEEL LIKE A MORE

02:22:53.365 --> 02:22:57.969 region:rollup2
DETAILED ANALYSIS SO IT BUT WHEN

02:22:55.634 --> 02:22:59.971 region:rollup2
SO IT'S DRIVEN BY THE PRICE. NOT

02:22:57.969 --> 02:23:03.241 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THE CONDITIONS.

02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:05.577 region:rollup2
IN THE GROUND.

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:06.812 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S BOTH I MEAN IF I EVER

02:23:05.577 --> 02:23:08.413 region:rollup2
BUY. IT.

02:23:06.812 --> 02:23:10.282 region:rollup2
YOU THINK IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO

02:23:08.413 --> 02:23:11.416 region:rollup2
REMOVE IT DOWN THAT PRICE HAS TO

02:23:10.282 --> 02:23:15.020 region:rollup2
BE HIGHER TO GET IT OUT OF THE

02:23:11.416 --> 02:23:16.288 region:rollup2
GROUND. SO I'M YOU KNOW BUT IT

02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:19.124 region:rollup2
STILL MOVES WITH PRICE.

02:23:16.288 --> 02:23:20.859 region:rollup2
BY A MIGHT BE.

02:23:19.124 --> 02:23:22.260 region:rollup2
LESS OF THE OIL IS.

02:23:20.859 --> 02:23:23.562 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC TO PULL OUT OF THE

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:25.297 region:rollup2
GROUND.

02:23:23.562 --> 02:23:26.832 region:rollup2
WHEN PRICES GO DOWN AND AND AND

02:23:25.297 --> 02:23:28.266 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE NOT AS ECONOMICAL

02:23:26.832 --> 02:23:30.469 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS EASIER TO

02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:31.036 region:rollup2
GET OUT OF THE GROUND. SO IT IS

02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:32.604 region:rollup2
STILL FLUCTUATES WITH PRICE

02:23:31.036 --> 02:23:35.073 region:rollup2
YEAH.

02:23:32.604 --> 02:23:37.876 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:23:35.073 --> 02:23:39.277 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

02:23:37.876 --> 02:23:41.213 region:rollup2
RIGHT AS A CLOSING COMMENT AT A

02:23:39.277 --> 02:23:42.714 region:rollup2
PLACE SO I JUST LIKE WANT ME TO

02:23:41.213 --> 02:23:45.450 region:rollup2
COMMENTS IS.

02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:48.353 region:rollup2
LAST WEEK A P. RAN A NATION WIDE

02:23:45.450 --> 02:23:49.921 region:rollup2
ARTICLE ABOUT. THE FACT THAT.

02:23:48.353 --> 02:23:51.256 region:rollup2
THERE WAS LIKE FIVE HUNDRED

02:23:49.921 --> 02:23:53.291 region:rollup2
FORTY THREE VIOLATIONS IN

02:23:51.256 --> 02:23:54.993 region:rollup2
COASTAL AND OFFSHORE FACILITIES

02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:56.761 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. THAT RAN

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:58.563 region:rollup2
NATIONWIDE FORTUNATE THE STORY

02:23:56.761 --> 02:24:00.232 region:rollup2
DIDN'T. THEY DIDN'T TAKE ENOUGH

02:23:58.563 --> 02:24:01.967 region:rollup2
TIME TO LET US. LOOKS AT HOW

02:24:00.232 --> 02:24:03.602 region:rollup2
MANY OF THOSE WE'VE VERIFIED

02:24:01.967 --> 02:24:06.037 region:rollup2
HAVE COMPLIED AND FIX THE

02:24:03.602 --> 02:24:08.373 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. BUT OF THOSE OF A

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:10.775 region:rollup2
FOREIGN FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE

02:24:08.373 --> 02:24:11.943 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED ALL BUT A HUNDRED FOUR

02:24:10.775 --> 02:24:13.979 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN EITHER TAKEN OUT OF

02:24:11.943 --> 02:24:15.647 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION ORDER VERIFIED WITH

02:24:13.979 --> 02:24:17.816 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE. SO THAT LEAVES IS

02:24:15.647 --> 02:24:18.316 region:rollup2
BASICALLY NINETEEN PERCENT OF

02:24:17.816 --> 02:24:20.452 region:rollup2
THOSE.

02:24:18.316 --> 02:24:22.554 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

02:24:20.452 --> 02:24:24.322 region:rollup2
GO VERIFY. THEY'VE ACTUALLY

02:24:22.554 --> 02:24:26.791 region:rollup2
COMPLIED WITH THE VIOLATION

02:24:24.322 --> 02:24:27.425 region:rollup2
ORDER I MEAN THE. NOTICE OF

02:24:26.791 --> 02:24:28.593 region:rollup2
VIOLATION THAT THEY NEED TO FIX

02:24:27.425 --> 02:24:30.295 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

02:24:28.593 --> 02:24:31.930 region:rollup2
AND I LITERALLY IS TO DEAL WITH

02:24:30.295 --> 02:24:33.899 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BODIES TO GO OUT AND

02:24:31.930 --> 02:24:35.267 region:rollup2
AND SEE A WALL SETS IN THAT CASE

02:24:33.899 --> 02:24:36.768 region:rollup2
IT WAS NINETEEN PERCENT OR A

02:24:35.267 --> 02:24:38.169 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FOUR OF THEM. NOW THEY

02:24:36.768 --> 02:24:39.771 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE COMPLIED WE DON'T KNOW

02:24:38.169 --> 02:24:41.373 region:rollup2
WE USED TO HAVE PEOPLE TO GO OUT

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:43.241 region:rollup2
AND SEE IT. IN THE LAST TWO

02:24:41.373 --> 02:24:44.309 region:rollup2
SHOWS ONE MADE ABOUT THE FEE IS

02:24:43.241 --> 02:24:46.344 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:48.046 region:rollup2
WE'RE ACTUALLY BELOW ALL THE

02:24:46.344 --> 02:24:49.614 region:rollup2
OTHER MAJOR OIL PRODUCING STATES

02:24:48.046 --> 02:24:51.583 region:rollup2
IN THE SIZE OF OUR FEE FOR OUR

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:53.785 region:rollup2
OIL REGULATORY SYSTEM WE'RE NOT

02:24:51.583 --> 02:24:55.520 region:rollup2
IN AN UNUSUAL WAY. WE'RE NOT

02:24:53.785 --> 02:24:56.855 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL AT ALL AND.

02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:58.590 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR INTENT THAT WE HOPE THE

02:24:56.855 --> 02:24:59.524 region:rollup2
FEES GO DOWN I WANT ONE OF

02:24:58.590 --> 02:25:00.458 region:rollup2
THINGS I MENTION THAT IS FOR

02:24:59.524 --> 02:25:01.626 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE I THINK IN THE NEXT

02:25:00.458 --> 02:25:03.161 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS IT PROBABLY WILL GO

02:25:01.626 --> 02:25:04.462 region:rollup2
DOWN A LITTLE BIT. BECAUSE THIS

02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:06.631 region:rollup2
WELL STAR PROGRAM WAS A BIG

02:25:04.462 --> 02:25:07.832 region:rollup2
BUBBLE OF COST IT WAS TWENTY

02:25:06.631 --> 02:25:09.534 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR.

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:11.002 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN THIS YEAR IT'LL BE FIVE

02:25:09.534 --> 02:25:11.736 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR BUT YOU AND THAT IS

02:25:11.002 --> 02:25:13.305 region:rollup2
GONNA GET DOWN TO ABOUT ONE

02:25:11.736 --> 02:25:15.240 region:rollup2
POINT THREE. SO IT'LL BE A YOUNG

02:25:13.305 --> 02:25:16.708 region:rollup2
TURNS ON GOING SO BUT IT WAS

02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:18.610 region:rollup2
THIS HUGE BUBBLE OF COST THAT

02:25:16.708 --> 02:25:20.245 region:rollup2
THIS HE IS PAYING FOR. SO THERE

02:25:18.610 --> 02:25:21.880 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKELY WILL BE A DECREASE

02:25:20.245 --> 02:25:25.517 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE IN THE REQUIRED.

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:27.018 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR DOING OUR JOB NOW.

02:25:25.517 --> 02:25:29.487 region:rollup2
ALSO THAT FEES WILL BE AFFECTED

02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:31.122 region:rollup2
BY IS AFFECTED BY HOW THE PRICE

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:32.224 region:rollup2
IS. NOT A PRODUCTION. BUT I JUST

02:25:31.122 --> 02:25:33.225 region:rollup2
WANT TO SHARE THAT I DON'T THINK

02:25:32.224 --> 02:25:34.726 region:rollup2
WE'RE AN UNUSUAL STAY IN FACT

02:25:33.225 --> 02:25:35.994 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN BELOW OTHER STATES IN

02:25:34.726 --> 02:25:37.095 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT WE CHARGE FOR

02:25:35.994 --> 02:25:39.998 region:rollup2
REGULATORY PROGRAM.

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:42.234 region:rollup2
AND TWO THAT WE STILL HAVE WORK

02:25:39.998 --> 02:25:43.702 region:rollup2
TO DO TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PLAN

02:25:42.234 --> 02:25:45.370 region:rollup2
A INSURE THAT OPERATORS.

02:25:43.702 --> 02:25:46.504 region:rollup2
ARE OPERATING SAFELY AND AND

02:25:45.370 --> 02:25:48.440 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO

02:25:46.504 --> 02:25:49.541 region:rollup2
HAVE INSPECTORS AND ENFORCEMENT

02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:49.841 region:rollup2

02:26:06.858 --> 02:26:11.263 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WORD THEY WERE TAKEN OUT

02:26:09.628 --> 02:26:13.465 region:rollup2
OF PRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE.

02:26:11.263 --> 02:26:14.1000 region:rollup2
IT'S QUITE AN ABOUT HALF AS WELL
