00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:38.390
WHAT MADE US THINK THAT IT

00:27:38.456 --> 00:27:38.690
SHOULD BE?

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:41.793
UNDER YOUR ROOF.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.894
I MEAN I SEE THAT YOU YOU YOU

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:43.928
GET YOU GOT A JOB THEY ASK YOU

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:46.031
TO DO IT SO YOU'RE GOING TO DO

00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:47.832
THE BEST JOB YOU CAN'T BUT

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:50.368
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GUYS DO.

00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:52.737
ELEMENT A THING THE THE HELPING

00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:55.273
A LARGE IN THE FIELD INSPECTION

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.377
THE WORKFORCE IS ELM.

00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:01.946
DEFINITELY WOULD BE E. L..

00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:03.214
A DIFFERENT FUNCTION FOR THE

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:04.482
COMMISSION WOULD GENERALLY A

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:06.284
REGULATORY BODY IN THE POLICY

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:07.886
MAKING BODY LOTS OF BOOTS ON THE

00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:10.655
GROUND ITS SCALE KIND OF BODY.

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.791
ARMOR I THINK THE CAN OF OVER

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:13.758
OLD.

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:15.060
YOU KNOW IF IF I WAS TO

00:28:15.126 --> 00:28:17.328
SPECULATE ELM IT'S BECAUSE OF

00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:18.797
YOU SEE HOUSING -- OVERALL

00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:20.265
AUTHORITY OVER UTILITIES.

00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:21.499
AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:23.001
UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:25.403
AND RELIABILITY OF AND COSTS AND

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.440
SO BECAUSE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.809
IS UTILITY OWNED GOES FALLS OF

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:35.947
THE PC. TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:37.615
THE ISSUES.

00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:38.283
RELATED TO THIS CHALLENGE WHERE.

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:39.451
IN THE UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:40.518
I THINK LONG TERM YOU KNOW WE

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:41.619
THEY CAN BE THIS CONVERSATIONS

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:43.488
HOW TO WHAT IS A LONG TERM

00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:45.156
STRATEGY FOR IT AND IF THE PC IS

00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:46.357
THE BEST THE AGENCY TO DO

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:48.726
CERTAIN FIELD WORK AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:28:48.793 --> 00:28:50.595
BUT AGAIN I THINK THE THOUGHT

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:51.963
BEHIND THE CONTRACT AND WHY IT'S

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.264
OF IN THE SHORT TERM BETTER TO

00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:55.166
DO IT THIS WAY IS BECAUSE IT

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.902
GIVE STATES FLEXIBILITY.

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:59.170
TO COME UP WITH THE LONG TERM

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:00.672
SOLUTIONS OF MAY AND MAY NOT

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:02.207
INVOLVE THE P. YOU SEE DOING IT

00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:03.608
BUT I THINK WE BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:05.810
SUCH A CRITICAL RISK LEVEL RIGHT

00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:07.946
NOW I THINK THIS A GENERAL.

00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:09.881
DESIRE BY BY THE PUBLIC AND

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:11.116
STAKEHOLDERS TO JUST HAVE

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:13.551
SOMEBODY GOING OUT DOING PATROLS

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:14.886
ALL WHILE WE ARE SORT OF

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:16.321
DISCUSSING LONG TERM SOLANO I

00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:20.525
DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.227
SOMEBODY SHOULD OUT.

00:29:22.293 --> 00:29:22.827
CONTROLS I JUST SAY YOU KNOW

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.362
NORMALLY WE THINK OF YOU GUYS

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.097
AND THAT -- THE ADVOCATE WHAT'S

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:26.631
THE HOW THE REPAIRS BEING

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:27.565
AFFECTED AND THAT'S NOT THE

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:29.834
SKILL SET THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:32.270

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:33.638
SOMETHING THAT.

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.607
BECAUSE IT IS ONE TIME OVER

00:29:35.673 --> 00:29:37.008
THREE YEARS -- THERE IS THE

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:38.376
OPPORTUNITY WHEN THAT'S UP TO

OR WHETHER ANOTHER ENTITY SHOULD.

00:29:45.817 --> 00:29:46.384

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE HOW ARE

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:01.565
WE DEFINING AND I GUESS.

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:02.833
HOW FAR ALONG HIS SEVENTY FIVE

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.903
GET US?

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:06.837
AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA FIND THE

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:07.571
REST.

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:09.306
JUST MAYBE THIRTY THAT FIRST AND

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:11.041
THEN COME BACK TO THE

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:12.710
ENFORCEMENT ONE WE DOING.

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:13.611
YEAH NO I THINK I'D EVEN

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:14.979
CANDIDLY -- THIS IS A RELATIVELY

00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:17.581
NEW IN IN BIG THING AND SO I

00:40:17.648 --> 00:40:18.816
DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL OF

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:19.350
THAT.

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:20.251
OUT YET -- AND A BIG PART OF

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:22.186
THIS EFFORT IS GONNA BE FIGURING

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.788
OUT WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:25.990
GAPS BILL AND I THINK SOME OF IT

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:28.125
IS FIGURING OUT WHICH AREAS

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:28.759
WHICH REGIONS TO THINK YOU'RE

00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:32.263
GOING TO BE.

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:33.397
THE MOST HIT BY IT.

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:35.065
I MEAN SURELY. THIRTY FIVE

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:35.900
MILLION IS NOT GONNA GO PROBABLY

00:40:35.966 --> 00:40:36.967
GO YOU KNOW TO FILL LITERALLY

00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:37.701
EVERY SINGLE GAP WE CAN

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:38.903
IDENTIFIES WITH THE OBVIOUSLY

00:40:38.969 --> 00:40:40.171
WE'RE GONNA BE TARGETING KIND OF

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:41.372
PRIORITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:43.240
AND I I THINK JUST CANDIDLY

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.041
SPEAKING WE'RE WE'RE STILL

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:44.942
FIGURING OUT.

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:46.610
YOU KNOW SOME OF OF WHERE THIS

00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:48.145
NEEDS TO GET FOCUSED THIS IS IN

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:49.580
PART OF THAT THAT THIRD PRONG

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:51.549
THE THIRTEEN MILLION THAT VISION

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:52.650
THING THAT.

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.585
UC'S COULD BE DOING ON YOUR ROAD

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:57.388
MAP IS THAT BECAUSE HE'S TALKING

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.122
ABOUT [inaudible]

00:40:58.189 --> 00:40:59.790
THE PLAN.

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:00.758
IS THAT THE THERE'S THREE PARTS

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:03.494
HERE. TWENTY FIVE THIRTEEN AND

00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:04.929
THREE SAID THIRTEEN IS FOR THIS.

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:09.033
THE VISION YOU SEE VISION.

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:10.434
I THINK ALL THOSE PARTS ARE

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:12.770
DEFINITELY RELATED THE THIRTY

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:15.005
MILLION IS FOR THE TWO ONE

00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:16.874
DEVELOPING THE VISION FOR HOW WE

00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:19.276
GOING TO SYSTEMATICALLY REDUCE.

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:20.845
THE RISK OF WILDFIRE FROM

00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:23.047
ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN

00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:25.182
THE FALL OF THE AN EVALUATION

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:27.384
FRAMEWORK FOR WELFARE MITIGATION

00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:28.919
PLANS AS WELL AS CLOSE SOME OUT

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:30.821
GAPS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN

00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:32.556
STANDARDS AND BEST PRACTICES.

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:34.124
THANK THE ENERGY SOLUTION CAN BE

00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:36.227
PART OF ITS -- BECAUSE IT IS ONE

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:37.795
OF THE TOOLS THE UTILITIES ARE

00:41:37.862 --> 00:41:39.697
USING I THINK WE WERE GOING INTO

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:41.832
THE POLICY QUESTION AS TO HOW

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:43.167
MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:44.168
RESILIENCE.

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.570
AND HOW MUCH IS THE STATE'S WE

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:49.607
SHOULD BE BASICALLY INVESTING IN

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:55.045
SO ALLOWING THEM TO ALL RIGHT

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:56.413
OUT.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.582
LOSS OF POWER WHETHER IT'S A

00:41:58.649 --> 00:41:59.917
PROACTIVE POWER SHUT OFF WERE --

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:00.985
OTHER EVENTS I THINK THAT IS

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:01.819
PROBABLY IT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:02.820
SCOPE OF THE THIRTEEN MILLION

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:03.854
THAT LEAST AS ENVISIONED IN THIS

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:04.655
MAY.

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:06.957
REVISE AND YOU KNOW THE ONLY

00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:08.692
THING I'D SAY ON THAT IS THAT

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:10.427
THE STAFFING THAT WE'RE ASKING

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:11.395
FOR THE P. YOU SEE.

00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:13.564
IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:15.099
STAFF TO BE WORKING ON THOSE

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:17.001
QUESTIONS TO BE WORKING WITH --

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:19.270
WE ELSE OUGHT TO COME UP WITH

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:20.838
HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THIS FROM

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:24.275
A POLICY PERSPECTIVE AND HOW DO

00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:28.445
WE SIZE THE COST OF THIS AND HOW

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:29.580
YOU PRIORITIZE IT AND UNLESS WE

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:30.981
HAVE STAFF CAN BE DEDICATED TO

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:31.415
AT HOME.

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:33.984
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.052
TO MAKE.

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:35.653
GET ANSWERS TO THOSE TO THOSE

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:38.522
QUESTIONS.

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:39.490
WHEN I WHO WE SAW IN THIS FIRST

00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:41.792
ROUNDOF WILD FIRE MITIGATION

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:43.160
PLANS IT JUST CAME FORWARD?

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:44.628
WAS VERY LIGHT.

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:46.530
ON D. E. R. ON DISTRIBUTED

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:47.731
ENERGY RESOURCES I MEAN WE SAW A

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:49.700
LOT OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:50.334
WHICH WILL WILL TALK ABOUT LATER

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:53.370
BUT VERY LITTLE ON SHOWING UP

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.773
NOT JUST EVEN CAL FIRE STATIONS

00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:58.275
RIGHT BUT CRITICAL CIRCUITS OR

00:42:58.342 --> 00:43:01.278
SENIOR CENTERS OR STOP LIGHTS OR

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:03.347
WATER PUMPS.

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:03.948
YOU WATER DISTRICTS THE THINGS

00:43:04.014 --> 00:43:05.482
THAT.

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:06.650
SO.

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:07.985
WHAT DO YOU AND ARE THERE OTHER

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:10.421
TOOLS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR TOOL

00:43:10.487 --> 00:43:11.488
KIT THAT?

00:43:11.555 --> 00:43:12.823
THAT ARE JUST.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.091
FROM THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:16.293
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HERE IN

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:16.894
TERMS OF TRYING TO TACKLE THIS

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:17.194
[inaudible]

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:20.397
YEAH.

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:21.432
YES I THINK THAT THE KING OF

00:43:21.498 --> 00:43:23.867
GOES TO THE THE REQUESTED THE

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:26.770
CONSULTING SUPPORT. FOR THE THE

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.639
OVERALL VISION AND THE THE

00:43:28.706 --> 00:43:30.541
EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR WELFARE

00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:32.076
MITIGATION PLANS BECAUSE WE'RE

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:34.111
IN A LITTLE BIT OF THE L. EITHER

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:35.446
BRING THE IRAQ EXERCISE WITH

00:43:35.512 --> 00:43:37.848
UTILITIES RIGHT NOW IS BE NINE A

00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:38.782
ONE DAY A DAY OUT WE GET THE SET

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:40.117
A REALLY GOOD FOUNDATION WITH

00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:40.617
DIRECTING.

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:42.086
UTILITIES TO HOW WHILE FIRE

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:43.754
MITIGATION PLANS BUT IT DIDN'T

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.489
SAY YOU KNOW.

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:47.958
HOW WITH THE STATE'S PRIORITIES

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:48.993
FOR MITIGATING WILDFIRES IN

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:50.861
THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:52.429
THERE'S ON THE GROUNDING THESE

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:54.431
USING CODED CONDUCTORS THERE'S

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:55.799
USING THE IMAGES ASIAN AND

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.067
PRODUCTS BUT WERE SHOT OFF IS A

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:57.868
RESOURCE?

00:43:57.935 --> 00:43:59.236
IS MAKING COMMUNITIES MORE

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.404
RESILIENT DEPENDING ON

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:01.839
MICROGRAMS IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:04.174
IDEAS OUT THERE AND WE CURRENTLY

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:06.677
COLLECTIVELY THE WEED THE STATE.

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:08.545
OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT ACTUALLY

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:11.215
HOW OF A WAY TO SAY WHAT IS THE

00:44:11.281 --> 00:44:12.616
RIGHT MIX AT THE STATE WHAT

00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:14.351
LEVEL OF HOW MUCH WE SHOULD BE

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:15.853
INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES IN

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:17.488
TERMS OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.089
RESOURCES AND BUILDING MORE

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:21.425
MICRO GRIDS OR UNDER GROUNDING.

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:22.693
WERE YOU KNOW VARIOUS OTHER

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.963
THINGS SO MY VISION FOR WHAT WE

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.698
WOULD DO WITH WITH THE

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:30.067
CONSULTANT IS TRY TO EXCEL.

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:31.602
THE POLICY MAKING ASPECTS OF

00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:33.270
THIS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.671
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A FRAMEWORK

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:36.540
AND HOW THE ABILITY TO SAY HOW

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:39.910
DO WE FIGURE OUT THE BALANCE OF

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:41.278
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:42.980
ALL OF YOU KNOW ON THE GROUNDING

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:44.815
VERSES MORE DISTRIBUTED

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:52.623
GENERATION FOR EXAMPLE -- AND SO

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:53.257
AS ALL OF YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW I

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:55.325
THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:56.527
TO HANDLE OF PUSH EVEN BACK ON

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:57.194
THE UTILITY AND SAY YOU NEED TO

00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:58.162
BE DOING SOMETHING MORE ALL OF

00:44:58.228 --> 00:44:59.797
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THOSE

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.965
GOALS SET AS A STATE YET.

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:03.367
BEFORE I WRAP YOUR LA -- DID YOU

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:04.201
GUYS HAVE A GOOD JOB OF COMMON

00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:06.703
JUST ON THE SCOPE OF NEED.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.006
TRY TO GET YOUR HEADS WRAPPED

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.541
UNDER EVEN GIVING US.

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:11.875
I'M INSIDE ON EVEN DEFINING WHAT

00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:13.444
IT WHAT IS A CRITICAL

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:14.411
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:16.080
HOW TO EVEN SCOPE THAT EVERY ALL

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:18.282
THOUGHT ABOUT?

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:20.818
I MEAN AT I GUESS I DON'T HAVE

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:22.553
THE A MINUTE WE I DON'T THINK

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:23.654
WE'VE DONE THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.988
I MEAN I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:26.123
GREAT QUESTION IT SOUNDS LIKE

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.157
YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING KIND OF

00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:28.092
THE THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:29.493
CONTINUING TO THINK ABOUT I MEAN.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.395
I THINK I I GENERALLY AGREE WITH

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:33.030
SORT OF THE COMMENTS AND AND THE

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:34.398
NEED.

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.466
FOR THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION

00:45:35.532 --> 00:45:36.733
PLANS THINKING THROUGH YOU KNOW

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.168
WHAT WHAT ARE THE BEST OPTIONS

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.536
OUT THERE WHAT WHICH OPTIONS ARE

00:45:39.603 --> 00:45:40.871
ACTUALLY REDUCING THEM THE

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:42.739
GREATEST AMOUNT OF RISK AT THE

00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:44.141
LOWEST POSSIBLE COST AND THAT'S

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:46.110
LIKELY GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:47.411
ANSWER AND DIFFERENT SCENARIO SO

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:48.145
SORT OF YOU KNOW.

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:49.446
TRYING TO KIND OF HAVE A HAVE A

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:51.048
MORE KIND OF FEDERAL FRAMEWORK

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:51.682
FOR A KIND OF THINKING THROUGH

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:52.783
THOSE QUESTIONS IN EVALUATING

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.718
THOSE QUESTIONS WHICH CAN THEN

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:55.185
KIND OF INFORM.

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:56.086
JUST.

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:58.422
YOU KNOW ENHANCED OVERSIGHT OVER

00:45:58.489 --> 00:45:59.890
WHAT UTILITIES ARE PROPOSING

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:01.258
ENHANCE GUIDANCE FOR THAT

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:02.726
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE TO EVEN

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:04.361
AMEND THE CURRENT LEASE

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:33.524
ELEMENT THE MAIN THING THAT WERE

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.525
ABLE TO ACHIEVE A THING WITH

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:35.826
THIS FIRST ROUND OF WELFARE

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:37.261
MITIGATION PLAN TO SEND THE

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:38.262
REALLY GOOD BASELINE.

00:46:38.328 --> 00:46:39.863
ALL IN ONE OF THE THINGS OF THE

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:40.697
COMMISSION IS DIRECTING

00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:44.935
PLACE.

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:46.737
SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY START

00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:48.906
GETTING A LOT BETTER DATA ABOUT

WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.315
SO IT IS JUST THROUGH EVERYTHING

00:46:58.382 --> 00:46:59.483
AND THE KITCHEN SINK IN THERE

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.684
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ANY ANYTHING

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:01.285

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:19.069
OF IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.537
MIGHT OFFER JUST A FEW COMMENTS

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:22.339
WE ACTUALLY ISSUED A REPORT

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.674
RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM EARLY

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:25.909
LAST MONTH.

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:26.943
TALK QUICKLY JUST KIND OF RUN

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.212
THROUGH SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES

00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:30.714
SO THAT THE REPORT WAS.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.349
INCLUDED AS ESTARá LAST YEAR

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:33.884
REQUIRING OUR OFFICE TO LOOK AT

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.852
A COUPLE ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:37.387
ONE IS JUST THE BUDGETING AND

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:39.256
THE FORECASTS FOR THE BUDGET

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:40.657
GOING FRWARD AND SO.

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:41.725
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS NOW

00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:43.059
IN THE PAST THERE'S BEEN QUITE A

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:44.094
FEW CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.495
FORECAST IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:46.296
PROGRAM.

00:52:46.363 --> 00:52:48.365
LARGELY RELATED TO THE EXPANSION

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:50.300
TO INCLUDE THE WIRELESS AND A

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:51.668
LOT OF THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:52.335
TO HOW MANY PROVIDERS ARE

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:55.539
PARTICIPATING WHAT CASELOAD IS --

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:57.941
IN THE END WHAT WE THINK THE

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.509
ESTIMATES ARE IMPROVING IN THAT

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:00.544
TO YOU SEE HAS BEEN DOING A MUCH

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:01.645
BETTER JOB RECENTLY BUT THERE

00:53:01.711 --> 00:53:02.913
CONTINUES TO BE A LOT OF

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:03.613
UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.915
SUSTENANCE AND SO.

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:06.383
WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:07.551
THE ESTIMATES THAT ARE INCLUDED

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.052
IN THIS BUDGET BUT JUST WANTED

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.453
TO THE FLAG THAT AND THAT ISSUE

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.254
FOR YOU AND THERE'S CONTINUE

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:12.222
UNCERTAINTY AND THERE IS SOME

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:13.189
LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT PROVIDES

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:14.724
THE ADMINISTRATION SOME

00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:16.092
FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUST IF.

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:17.894
IF COSTS -- INCREASE BEYOND THE

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:19.496
ESTIMATED AMOUNT.

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:21.431
THE OTHER ISSUE WITH -- WE WERE

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:22.832
ASKED TO LOOK AT WAS JUST THE

00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:25.769
GENERAL ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:27.437
POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND GETTING

00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:31.341
ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS TO ENROLL IN

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:32.309
THE PROGRAM.

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:33.243
AND JUST FOR CONTEXT RIGHT NOW --

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:34.978
ROUGHLY 40% OF THE ESTIMATED

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:37.314
ELIGIBLE POPULATION ISN'T IS

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.115
ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM --

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:40.450
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THERE'S A

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:41.418
WIDE VARIETY OF POTENTIAL

00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:43.787
REASONS FOR THAT -- INCLUDING

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:44.487
ONE THAT.

00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:45.956
HOUSEHOLD MIGHT JUST BE UNAWARE

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:47.857
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:48.458
FOR THE PROGRAM AT THE PROGRAM

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:51.361
EXISTS. TO THEY MIGHT PER -- FOR

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:54.130
SOME OTHER KERRIER PLAN -- ONE

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:55.932
THAT'S NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:56.533
PROGRAM AND THEN THREE THERE

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.300
MIGHT BE.

00:53:57.367 --> 00:53:58.969
AREAS CHALLENGES RELATED TO IF

00:53:59.035 --> 00:53:59.536
THAT EVEN IF THEY KNOW THE

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:00.971
PROGRAM ACCESS AND WANT TO

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.205
ENROLL A GOING THROUGH THE

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:04.341
PROCESS OF IN ROMAN AND RENEWALS --

00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:05.942
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NOT A LOT

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.677
OF GREAT INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:08.411
OF THESE FACTORS ARE KIND OF THE

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:11.181
PRIMARY DRIVER AND THE CURRENT

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.782
ENROLLMENT RATES AND SO WE WOULD

00:54:12.849 --> 00:54:14.050
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:15.251
THE PC TO CONDUCT.

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:16.920
AN EVALUATION ESSENTIALLY KIND

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:18.288
OF A SURVEY OF ELIGIBLE

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:19.422
HOUSEHOLDS TO GET A BETTER SENSE

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:21.524
OF WHAT THE PRIMARY BARRIERS ARE

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:24.294
TO ACTUALLY ENROLL IN THE

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:26.062
PROGRAM.

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:26.963
IN THE MEANTIME THE THE

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.597
LEGISLATURE MY ONE DIRECT YOU

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:28.365
SEE ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:29.199
WAS DIRECT THEM TO CONDUCT SOME

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:30.567
PILOTS AND KIND OF EXPLORING

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:31.835
SOME OF THE SOME POTENTIAL

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:34.104
CHANGES THAT MIGHT ADDRESS SOME

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:35.238
OF THE PROBLEMS.

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:36.906
THIS PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE SOME

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.942
FUNDING FOR A PILOT THAT HAS

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.844
BEEN ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:42.178
AND WE THINK THAT'S GENERALLY A

00:54:42.245 --> 00:54:47.250
STEP IN ASK THE COMMISSION ABOUT

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:49.219
HOW IT PLANS TO EVALUATE THAT.

00:54:49.285 --> 00:54:50.720
PILOT IN ORDER TO KINDA ATTAIN

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:52.122
INFORMATION THAT CAN CAN HELP

INFORM YOUR YOUR DECISIONS ABOUT

00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:55.458
ANY CHANGES GOING FORWARD TO TO

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:56.793
ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.161
POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.

00:54:58.228 --> 00:54:59.929
YOU SEE HOW DO YOU PLAN TO

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.264
EVALUATE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:03.166
FROM THE OHIO.

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:04.234
WE HAVE A CURRENT PROCEEDING

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.935
BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND MANY

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:07.337
OF THE ISSUES THAT THE OTHER WAS

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:08.471
RAISED ARE ALSO OCCURRING IN

00:55:08.538 --> 00:55:09.806
THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN THE

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:10.874
PRECEDING.

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:14.744
WITH REGARDS TO THE PILOTS WERE

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:15.812
EXPLORING TWO OUT OF TWO

00:55:15.879 --> 00:55:16.379
DIFFERENT PILOTS HAS BEEN

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:18.982
APPROVED AND THREE MORE PILOTS

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:20.050
THAT ARE UNDER EVALUATION.

00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:21.751
AND THE TOTAL OF THE UNIVERSE OF

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:23.453
PILOTS LOOKS AT MANY OF THE

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.488
ISSUES THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:26.756
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:27.957
WE'RE LOOKING AT STREAMLINING

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.759
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:30.994
PROCESS OF SIGNING UP FOR THE

PROGRAM WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:35.065
IMPROVING THE RENEWAL PROCESS.

00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:36.299
WERE LOOKING AT REACHING

00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:37.867
UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:38.802
COMMUNITIES.

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:41.004
ARE ALSO LOOKING AT ATTRACTING

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.272
OF PARTICIPANTS SERVICE

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:44.207
PROVIDERS IN THE PROGRAM WHICH

MAY HAVE MORE RECOGNITION.

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:47.944
WITH PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:48.778
SO IT MAY BE MORE DESIRABLE

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:49.846
MAYBE THAT IS A MORE DESIRABLE

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:51.981
OPTION. TO THOSE OF THE MAIN

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:53.116
FACTORS THAT WERE ADJUSTING T

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:55.385

PERIOD OF TIME WAITING TIME --

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.747
WE EXPECTED WE WERE GONNA HAVE

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:55.418
THE FIRST ONE READY TO FLY AND

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:56.852
NINETEEN TWENTY AND THAT'S GOING

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.587
TO TAKE SOME TIME AND THROUGH

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:00.923
THE PROCESS OF OF RECEIVING

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:04.560
THOSE THOSE -- AIR TANKERS FROM

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:05.361
THE AIRFORCE THE FEDERAL

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:06.996
GOVERNMENT -- THEY HAVE TO BE

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:09.332
RETROFITTED TO BE ACTUAL AIR

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:11.767
TANKERS -- RIGHT NOW THEY ARE

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:13.502
THEY DON'T HAVE THE TANK SYSTEM

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:15.938
AND THE AND THE RETURN DELIVERY --

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.341
CAPABILITY OF AN AIR TANKER SO

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.008
THAT WILL HAVE TO BE DONE BEFORE

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:22.111
WE TAKE RECEIPT OF THOSE -- AND

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:24.480
IN THE INTERIM -- WE ARE SHORT

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:25.915
AND AIR TANKER THAT WE WERE

01:06:25.981 --> 01:06:29.452
HOPING TO HAVE -- AS WELL AS WE

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.821
ARE SHORT PILOTS TO FLY THOSE

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.956
AIRCRAFT ONCE THEY COME ON LINE

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.391
IF WE DON'T START TRAINING THEM

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:36.559
NOW.

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:39.128
SO BETWEEN THOSE -- TWO THOSE

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:40.296
TWO NEEDS.

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:41.964
WE ARE ASKING AND AND THAT AND

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:43.366
THAT'S NEW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:45.568
HAVE THE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:47.002
WOULDN'T BE GETTING THOSE THOSE

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:49.238
AIR TANKERS WHEN WE WERE WHEN WE

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:50.706
WERE BUILDING OUR BUDGET REQUEST --

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:55.010
LAST FALL FOR THE JANUARY BUDGET.

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:55.811
A COUPLE OF OTHER ITEMS --

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:59.315
RELATED TO TO THIS -- WHAT I'LL

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:02.351
CALL A LARGER TANKER LATT?

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:05.588
WE CAL FIRE DON'T HAVE A LARGE

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.623
AIR TANKER IN OUR FLEET --

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.759
WITHOUT THIS.

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:12.328
THIS AIR TANKER -- THE SOME OF

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:13.863
THE REASONS THAT THAT'S

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:16.165
IMPORTANT GOING INTO -- THIS

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:18.801
COMING SEASON -- THE HEAVY GRASS

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.237
COURT CROP AND THE AS THAT

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:23.072
STARTS TO DRY WERE EXPECTING

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:25.107
THAT THAT WILL INCREASE FIRE

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:29.445
ACTIVITY -- TO AND THEN PASS

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:32.148
INTO THOSE -- BRUSH AND TIMBER

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:34.150
COVERED LANDSCAPES --

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:36.085
PARTICULARLY IN THE THE THE

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:38.687
CENTRAL SIERRA WE HAVE VERY

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.557
HEAVY LARGE FUELS THAT REQUIRE A

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:44.293
HEAVIER LOAD OF AIR TANKER.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.828
DROP IN ORDER TO COAT THEM

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.898
PROPERLY AND AND REDUCE THE

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:51.634
SPREAD OF FIRE -- WE DO NOT HAVE

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:55.438
A LACK IN OUR ARSENAL OR R. R.

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:57.540
TO BAG OF TOOLS WITHOUT THIS WE

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:59.241
CAN CALL THEM UP FROM THE

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:00.476
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:02.711
BUT OFTEN PARTICULARLY EARLY IN

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:04.880
THE SEASON THOSE AIR TANKERS ARE

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:09.285
IN OTHER PARTS OF OF THE NATION

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:10.619
FIGHTING FIRE.

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:11.253
ANOTHER ITEM THAT WE LEARNED --

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.422
JUST THIS MORNING ACTUALLY FROM

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:16.725
FROM -- ADJUTANT GENERAL BALD

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.661
ONE IS THAT ONE OF OUR MATHS --

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:21.263
CAPABLE SHIPS AND CREWS OUT OF

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:24.166
CHANNEL ISLANDS -- IS.

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:25.701
NOT A THEIR OUT OF THE OUT OF

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.870
COUNTRY ON DEPLOYMENT UNTIL LATE

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.538
IN THE SEASON END OF AUGUST IT

01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:31.407
SOUNDS LIKE -- BEFORE THEY WILL

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:34.677
BE BACK AND READY TO TRAIN AND

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.612
GET THAT SHIP READY TO GO.

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:38.481
SO WE WILL BE DOWN ONE MASS

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:40.716
CAPABLE -- AIRCRAFT IN

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.319
CALIFORNIA THROUGH MOST OF THIS

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:45.120
OF THIS SEASON THAT THAT'S

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.722
THAT'S BRAND NEW INFORMATION WE

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:51.393
JUST FOUND OUT -- TODAY SO.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.128
WITH THAT -- WE BELIEVE THAT

01:08:53.195 --> 01:08:56.065
THIS TOOL IS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.601
TOOL FOR US THIS SEASON IN

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:01.203
PARTICULAR AND UNTIL WE HAVE.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.072
THE PILOTS ON OUR OWN C. ONE

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:04.440
THIRTIES IN PLACE.

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:07.109
IT WILL SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY.

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.311
WITH THE NEW CAPABILITY THAT

01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:10.546
WHAT IT WILL BRING TO US.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.248
ON THE PIECE BEFORE WE GET TO

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.782
THE LA L. THERE'S A PIECE THAT

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:15.484
THE TRAINING PIECE AND THEN

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.386
THERE'S THE MECHANICS TRAINING

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:19.154
PIECE OF A FOR LEASING.

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.257
SOMEBODY ELSE'S AIRPLANE THAT

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.192
WERE. FOR A YEAR BECAUSE WE'RE

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:27.596
WE'RE SHORT WE NORMALLY PAY FOR

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.131
THE TRAINING ON THE MECHANICS.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:29.865
ON THAT I MEAN I I IF THEY WERE

01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:31.166
OURS I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.668
WOULD BE THE SAME BUT THE SAD.

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:34.637
IS THAT NORMAL.

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.906
I HAVE DEPUTY DIRECTOR -- TYLER

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:39.975
HERE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.677
GOOD AFTERNOON MY APOLOGIES THAT

01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:43.145
I'VE BEEN COUGHING ALL DAY --

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:44.880
JOE TYLER DEPUTY DIRECTOR CAL

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:45.614
FIRE.

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:47.783
SO AT THE PRIMARY BENEFIT OF

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.485
HAVING A TRAINING PLATFORM IS

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.520
THE ABILITY TO TRAIN -- OUR

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.188
CURRENT PILOTS AS WELL AS FUTURE

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:54.523
PILOTS TO BE ABLE TO FLY THE C.

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:55.491
ONE THIRTIES.

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:57.660
AS A SECONDARY BENEFIT OF HAVING

01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:59.461
THAT AIRCRAFT IN PLACE IT ALLOWS

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:00.896
THE VENDOR WHO'D BE PROVIDING

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:02.998
THE SOLE C. ONE THIRTY WITH

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:04.967
THEIR MECHANICS TO TRAIN OUR

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.635
DYNCORP MECHANICS IN THE

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.504
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE.

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:09.939
IT IS A SECONDARY BENEFIT AS

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:12.875
ANOTHER SECONDARY BENEFIT TO AS

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:15.077
DIRECTOR PORTER MENTIONED -- THE

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:19.315
SECOND -- RIP BENEFIT PROVIDES --

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.516
AN ACTIVE WILDLAND FIRE FIRE

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.017
FIGHTING C. ONE THIRTY TO THE

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:24.153
SYSTEM DROPPING FOUR THOUSAND

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:26.255
GALLONS RETARDED COMPARED TO THE

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:26.889
EIGHT HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:27.256
GALLONS.

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:29.291
ARE AS TO DROP NOW.

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:30.960
YEAH I EIGHT I JUST GOT A

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:31.860
CONCERN WITH THE PLATFORM I

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:33.629
GUESS ON THE OUT YEARS IF YOU

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:35.297
THINK YOU NEED THREE YEARS TO

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:36.932
TRAIN THE MECHANICS AND THEN

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:37.933
YOU'RE DOING IT THIS YEAR WE'RE

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.371
NOT GONNA DO IT IN. TWENTY

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:42.972
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE RIGHT

ALEJO YOU HAVE SOME.

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:53.148
INCONCLUSIVE -- OBSERVATIONS --

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:54.516
JUST COMPUTERS AT THE

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.685

THE ON THE SEVEN C. ONE THIRTY

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.275
PROGRAM SAID THIS WOULD BE THE

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:21.610
TRAINING PLATFORM ON TOP OF THAT.

ADMINISTRATION IS ASSERTING THAT.

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:31.220
THIS AND FOUR POINT SIX MILLION

01:11:31.286 --> 01:11:32.721
DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY IS

01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:33.589
SOMEONE A CAUGHT ABOUT COST

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.624
NEUTRAL IN THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.027
WOULD VERY LIKELY AND KERR AND

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.361
THE SAME OR EVEN POTENTIALLY

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:41.830
HIGHER COSTS -- TO HAVE A

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:43.799
CONTRACT PLANE BROUGHT ON BOARD

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.567
DURING PEAK FIRE SEASON -- WE

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:46.835
DID GET SOME BACK UP DATA FROM

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:48.604
THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS ASSERTION

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:50.873
AND IT'S SOMEONE INCONCLUSIVE ON

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.307
IN MANY YEARS IT APPEARS THAT

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:53.909
THE AMOUNT THAT WAS SPENT B THE

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.511
DEPARTMENT ON SORT OF A CALL WE

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:56.745
NEED A CONTRACT FOR THE PLANE

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.547
WOULD BE AVAILABLE ONLY FOR

01:11:58.614 --> 01:11:59.348
THOSE FIRE.

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:00.149
FIGHTING NEEDS ANOTHER TRAINING

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:02.785
NEEDS -- IS GENERALLY LESS THAN

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:03.819
THE AMOUNT THAT SPENT HERE IN

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.521
SOME AREAS IT'S IT'S IN THE SAME

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:06.955
BALLPARK IN AND IN A FEW

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:09.058
INSTANCES IT WAS HIGHER -- AND

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.993
SO IT'S IT'S NOT ABUNDANTLY

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.161
CLEAR HOW MUCH SHE WOULD BE

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:14.196
SAVED AND THAT'S REALLY ALL

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.432
GOING TO DEPEND ON AND REALLY

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:17.733
WHAT THE FIRE FIGHTING NEEDS ARE --

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.334
IN THE UPCOMING FIRE SEASONS

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:21.603
OVER THE COURSE OF THIS CONTRACT

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:22.738
WHICH NO ONE CAN REALLY PROTECT.

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:24.540
ON BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THAT

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:25.641
AND THERE WOULD BE SOME

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.509
OFFSETTING SAVINGS I AM JUST

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:29.778
BASED ON WHAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:32.347
INCURRED IN PAST YEARS -- FOR

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:33.749
CONTRACTING FOR THIS PEAK

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:35.918
SERVICES I'M IN TERMS OF USING

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:38.187
THIS AS A TRAINING PLATFORM FOR

01:12:38.253 --> 01:12:39.388
THAT THE PILOTS AND THE

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:40.355
MECHANICS.

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:41.924
AND WE JUST THINK THAT THE

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.225
LEGISLATURE IS GONNA WANT TO

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:44.727
ALIGN YOUR ACTIONS ON THIS

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:46.962
PROPOSAL WITH THE LARGER SEE

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:49.331
WHEN -- THIRTY PROGRAM PROPOSAL

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:50.312
OUR PROPOSED PLAN IS TO TRAIN

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.880

OTHERS ARE CURRENTLY FLYING J.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.777
MODEL AND I WOULD ASSUME.

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:22.344

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:26.581
FLYING IS C. ONE THIRTY AND FIRE

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:27.149
FIGHTING IS DIFFERENT THAN

FLYING IS C..

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:31.019
ONE THIRTY IN THE MILITARY.

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:32.721
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A MILITARY

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:34.189
EXPERIENCE.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.024
I CAN'T I CAN'T ANSWER THAT A

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.694
PROPERLY OF THE VAN -- FLYING

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.795
LOW LEVEL FLIGHTS OVER

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:42.597
VEGETATION IN FIRE CONDITIONS IS

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:45.801
A HIGH RISK -- INITIATIVE SURE

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.936
GO IT AYE AYE LET ME TO SAVE A

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:50.238
COUPLE WORDS FOR JOE'S VOICE.

REFER FOR OTHER QUESTIONS -- TOO

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.675
BUT WHAT WE ALSO ALREADY DO

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.759
NATIONAL GUARD TO DO THIS

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:14.363
MISSION SO THEY HAVE SEVERAL OF

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:15.497
FLIGHT CREWS.

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:16.465
THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:18.100
TRAINING I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:20.402
NUMBER -- BUT BUT WE DO HAVE

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.603
THAT CAPABILITY AND OUR

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:24.306
EXPECTATION IS AS CAL FIRE HAS

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:26.942
THIS -- PERMANENT WORK FORCE.

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:29.344
OPPORTUNITY THERE WILL BE --

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:31.513
SOME OF THOSE AIR TANKER PILOTS

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.582
THAT ARE ALSO MILITARY C. ONE

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:35.550
THIRTY PILOTS -- THAT WILL COME

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:37.919
INTO OUR OUR PILOT PROGRAM --

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:39.454
CAM I'M IMAGINE SEE ONE THIRTIES

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:43.358
OR USE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:43.859
COUNTRY ALREADY FOR FIRE

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:44.860
FIGHTING.

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:45.994
HE THREW IT THROUGH -- CONTRACT

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:46.661
ONLY THAT WE DON'T THERE AREN'T

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:47.896
ANY THAT ARE IN -- GOVERNMENT

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.598

01:17:49.664 --> 01:17:51.299
I'M AWARE OF NATIONAL GUARD OKAY

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:52.467
FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD YEAH SO

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:53.935
WHEN WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:56.138

AND FULL TIME WITH CAL FIRE.

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:00.809
SO THERE IS A PHASED IN MULTI

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:03.245
YOUR APPROACH -- BASED ON A

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:05.147

THAT THEY HAVE.

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:44.286
THE PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE SIME

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:55.764
THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY

WORK THROUGH THIS NEW PROCESS OF

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:29.844
IDENTIFYING A PROBLEM AND THEN --

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:31.179
WORKING THROUGH AN INNOVATIVE

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:33.882
PROCESS TO TO GET IDEAS AND

01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:35.784
CONCEPTS THAT WOULD THEN TURN

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:40.722
INTO -- A DEPLOYMENT SCHEDULE

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:41.289
THAT WOULD.

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:42.724
LOOK INTO NEXT YEAR AND THE

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:47.062
FUTURE -- SO -- WHAT WE'VE DONE --

INNOVATORS.

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:57.539
TO OF CONCEPTS DURING THIS --

01:22:57.605 --> 01:23:00.075
THIS COMING FIRE SEASON -- WE'RE

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:01.643
LOOKING.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.278
FOR THE BUDGET REQUESTED PIECE

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:05.213
OF THIS IS THE IS FOR FIVE

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.582
MILLION DOLLARS IN STIPENDS FOR

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:14.356
VENDORS -- THIS IS TO INCREASE

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:16.524
SAY MOM AND POP OR INVADERS THAT

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:19.561
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OF FINANCIAL

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:22.430
RESOURCES. TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:25.100
THOSE REALLY GOOD IDEAS IF THEY

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:26.201
COME ABOUT.

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:28.770
A AND THEN A REQUEST FOR TEN

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.805
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROOF OF

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:33.475
CONCEPT PHASE -- THAT WULD --

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:36.845
THEN PUT US INTO -- EVALUATION

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:39.948
OF THOSE CONCEPTS AS THEY ROLL

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:42.484
OUT THROUGH THE FIRE SEASON --

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:46.421
THE LET'S SEE THE DEPARTMENT

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:48.289
EXPECTS THAT THIS -- AGAIN WOULD

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:50.692
BE DEPLOYED NEXT FIRE SEASON ON

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:54.095
A MORE PERMANENT BASIS BUT

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:56.097
CONCEPTS WOULD BE APPROVED

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:58.099
THROUGH THIS SEASON AND INTO THE

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:01.236
THE WINTER PERIOD.

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.070
HOWEVER YOU HAS SOME

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:04.139
OBSERVATIONS ON THIS BUDGET

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:05.774
REQUEST THERE ARE SO AND

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.142
TYPICALLY EACH MISTER CHAIR

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:09.077
MEMBERS AS YOU KNOW AND THE

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:10.545
NORMAL PROCESS WOULD BE FOR A

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:11.813
DEPARTMENT.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.882
TO EVALUATE ITS SOLUTIONS TO A

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:16.184
PROBLEM AND AND AND HAVE A

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:17.385
DETAILED EXPLANATION OF WHAT

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:18.586
THEY WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON AND

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:20.188
THEN BRING THAT REQUEST FOR TO

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:21.122
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:23.191
AND THROUGH THIS ALTERNATIVE I'M

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:25.160
PROCUREMENT PROCESS THAT IS

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.895
REALLY SORT OF BEING PILOT

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:28.863
TESTED HERE AT CAL FIRE -- IT'S

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:30.732
KIND OF FLIPPING THINGS I AM IN

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:31.933
THE ORDER OF THINGS AND THAT

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.101
MAKES IT SO MUCH CHALLENGING FOR

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:35.503
THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:36.871
EVALUATE YOUR BEING ASKED TO

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:37.872
APPROVE.

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.908
MONEY TO DO THINGS THAT WILL

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:41.443
SOLVE A PROBLEM STATEMENT

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:42.610
WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING WHAT

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:44.546
EXACTLY AND THOSE THINGS WOULD

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:46.314
BE AND EXACTLY HOW THE FUNDS

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:47.649
WOULD BE SPENT.

01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:49.551
I THAT BEING SAID IN OUR OFFICE

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:51.252
RECOGNIZES THAT POTENTIAL

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:52.754
BENEFITS FROM DOING THINGS IN A

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:55.089
DIFFERENT AND MORE CREATIVE WAY

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:56.357
AT LEAST PILOT TESTING IT OUT

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:58.259
AND SEEING HOW IT GOES AND THIS

01:24:58.326 --> 01:24:59.260
FIRST YEAR.

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:02.297
AND AND SO THE OVERALL CONCEPT

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:03.731
AND MAY IS IS SOMEWHAT

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:05.500
REASONABLE IN THAT REGARD AND

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:07.435
THE LANGUAGE HOWEVER THAT IS

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:09.471
PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:11.372
THE PROVISIONAL BUDGET LANGUAGE --

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:12.941
BUT WE THINK IT DOES NOT REALLY

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.709
PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:17.278
THE LEGISLATURE AND AND ENOUGH

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:18.746
AND SORT OF FEEDBACK TO THE

01:25:18.813 --> 01:25:20.515
LEGISLATURE BEFORE FINDING IS

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:22.617
SPENT ON SO AND OUR FIRST

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:24.018
CONCERN IS.

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.420
THAT THE BUDGET LANGUAGE ALLOWS

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:26.354
BASICALLY UNLIMITED

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:29.524
AUGMENTATIONS THROUGH AND JUST A

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:31.059
NOTIFICATION TO THE G. JOINT

01:25:31.125 --> 01:25:32.260
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE.

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:34.062
ON IN SOME CASES THAT'S ONLY A

01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:35.230
FIFTEEN DAY NOTIFICATION WHICH

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:36.664
REALLY DOES NOT PROVIDE THE

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.633
LEGISLATURE -- BUT WITH THE VERY

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.802
MUCH TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT COULD

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:42.770
BE POTENTIALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:43.271
MID YEAR.

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:45.974
ON BUDGETARY AUGMENTATIONS AND

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.242
AND THEN IT'S ONLY GOING THROUGH

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:48.610
JUST THAT MAKE YOUR PROCESS

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:49.811
WHERE THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE'S

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:56.551
NOT HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY IT'S

01:25:56.618 --> 01:25:57.952
JUST THROUGH THE JAIL BC.

01:25:58.019 --> 01:25:58.586
AND THE SECOND CONCERN THAT WE

01:25:58.653 --> 01:25:59.220
HAVE WITH THE LANGUAGE IS THAT

01:25:59.287 --> 01:25:59.854
IT DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE FOR A

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:00.688
WAY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:02.056
KEPT UPDATED AND APPRISED ON THE

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:02.590
PROGRESS.

RECEIVED RESPONSES BACK.

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:14.569
I HAVEN'T THE ANSWER THAT WE

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:16.104
GUIDE AND IS THAT THEY'RE

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:17.105
THEY'RE NOT REALLY ABLE TO SAY

01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:18.006
ANYTHING THERE UNDER A

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:19.641
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS AND

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:20.675
THEY'RE NOT ABLE.

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:23.111
TO I AM A SHARE INFORMATION ON

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:25.113
AND I'M REALLY IN THE NUMBER OF

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:26.381
RESPONSES THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.249
THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS ARE

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:28.716
SOLUTIONS THAT THEY'RE

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:29.817
EVALUATING.

01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:30.585
AND TO REALLY GET THE

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:31.886
LEGISLATURE A SENSE OF WHAT

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:34.222
MIGHT YOU BE BUYING FOR THIS

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:34.789
FIFTEEN MILLION ARE FIFTEEN

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.324
MILLION CLASS AND SO WE WOULD

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:38.126
RECOMMEND -- IF YOU WANT TO GO

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:40.295
FORWARD WITH THIS I AM REVISING

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:42.263
OF THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:43.565
REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:44.933
REPORT BACK ONCE THEY'RE DONE

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:47.669
WITH THE EVALUATION AND FEES OF

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:49.571
AND THE INITIAL PART BEFORE THEY

01:26:49.637 --> 01:26:51.005
START SPENDING MONEY BEFORE

01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:52.941
THEY'RE PUTTING I'M FUNDING INTO

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:54.142
ANY OF THESE PROTOTYPES.

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:55.076
SO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE KNOW

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:56.644
WHAT DID THEY FIND WHAT TYPES OF

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.546
SOLUTIONS WERE PROPOSED AND

01:26:58.613 --> 01:26:59.147
WHICH ONES DO THEY WANT TO GO

01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:05.353
FORWARD WITH -- AND THEN ALSO

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.488
COMING BACK AND BEFORE FINDING A

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:09.090
SPENT AND AND AND PUTING A CAP

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:09.657
ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT.

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:10.391
OF MAYBE MAKES SENSE TO GIVE

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:11.659
SOME FLEXIBILITY IF IT'S STILL

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:13.661
SORT OF AND CLEAR WHAT TYPES OF

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:14.562
SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE I'M.

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:15.697
PILOT TESTED THROUGH THIS

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:16.931
PROCESS AND AND HOW MUCH THAT

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:18.900
MIGHT COST THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:20.335
TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:21.703
THE FUNDING -- BUT WE THINK YOU

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:22.904
WOULD WANT TO CAP IT SAYS THAT

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:24.072
YOU AT LEAST HAVE A SENSE OF

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:25.073
WHAT YOU'RE BUDGETARY COMMITMENT

01:27:25.139 --> 01:27:26.207
IS ON THIS.

01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:28.209
IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH AT LEAST

01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:29.644
PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:31.512

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:32.880
MEAN I GET THAT THE FACT THAT

01:27:32.947 --> 01:27:34.449
SOME OF THIS IS PROPRIETARY

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:36.651
INFORMATION OR MIGHT BE IN THIS

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:36.985
IS THESE ARE.

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:39.053

THESE INNOVATIVE IDEAS BUT AT

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:43.691

I. R. -- THIS IS A SOMEONE OF A

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:44.585
LONGER PROCESS THAT WE'VE BEEN

CALIFORNIA AND ALSO BE TRYING.

01:33:55.029 --> 01:33:55.863
TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT THE

WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:06.874
TREATMENTS AS WELL AS FUEL

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:11.212
BRAKES -- IT'S A KEY KEY PS I

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:12.713

01:34:15.449 --> 01:34:17.418
AND MOVING FORWARD AND TRYING TO

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:19.587
INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF

VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:24.458
FOR WILDLAND FIRE PREVENTION WAS

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:34.635
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:36.170
IT'S A PROGRAMMATIC E. I. R..

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:38.172
THAT'S COVERING TWENTY THREE

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:39.006
TWENTY POINT THREE MILLION ACRES

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:43.544
THAT IS CORRECT.

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:44.812
SO WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE E. R.

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:46.480
IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS THE

01:34:46.547 --> 01:34:47.915
WORK PROGRAM GO AHEAD YEAH I

WOULD LOVE SOME MORE INSIGHT

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:51.052
INTO THIS BEEN OVER A DECADE IN

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:53.954
THE MAKING HERE -- REPORTER

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.222
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR JUST

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:56.424
THE UNIQUE.

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:58.159
NATURE OF CHAPARRAL VERSES BIG

01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:00.795
TREE COUNTRY.

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:02.196
THE FIRST FEW MITIGATION PLAN

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:03.831
THAT CAME OUT.

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:05.900
I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:09.203
FORMULA BEING USED THEIR BEING

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.205
TO CENTRIC AROUND.

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:12.940
TREES AND NOT ENOUGH ABOUT

01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:14.408
PUBLIC SAFETY AND COMMUNITIES IN

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:15.476
SORT OF HITTING THAT THE

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:16.977
GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:18.145

A HAVE THE TEARING MIGHT WORK ON

01:35:21.615 --> 01:35:22.616
OTHER PROGRAMMATIC YEAH ARE LIKE

01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:24.218
HOW HOW TO FIND ARE WE GOING TO

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:25.186
BE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:26.520
THEN IS THERE.

01:35:26.587 --> 01:35:29.590
ARE YOU ALL SECONDARILY ARE YOU.

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.258
ARE THERE OTHER PLANS GOING ON

01:35:31.325 --> 01:35:33.094
BESIDES SORT OF PRESCRIBED FIRE

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.196
APPROACH TO CHAPARRAL THAT YOU

01:35:35.262 --> 01:35:36.797
ANTICIPATE DEPLOYING IN THAT

01:35:36.864 --> 01:35:38.833
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA SO I

01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:41.135
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WANNA TAKE

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:41.735
THE ORDER OF I TAKE THE FIRST

01:35:41.802 --> 01:35:43.504
QUESTION.

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.539

BACK FOR ONE SECOND IN TERMS OF

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.579
TEARING PART OF THE REASON WHY

01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:53.380
THEY SAID -- THIS ISSUE WAS

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:58.319
TAKEN SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME --

TO TO MOVE FORWARD IS THAT IT IS

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:01.722
VERY TECHNICAL THERE IS A LOT OF

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.090
DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES

01:36:03.157 --> 01:36:03.657
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:36:03.724 --> 01:36:05.226
HABITATS THERE'S A LOT OF

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:06.327
DIFFERENT SPECIES ASSOCIATED

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:07.161
WITH THOSE HABITATS OF

01:36:07.228 --> 01:36:09.063
VEGETATION TYPES ACROSS TWENTY

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:10.965
POINT. TWENTY MILLION ACRES OF

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:12.666
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:14.268
SO THERE IS A CHECKLIST AND ALSO

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:16.203
ME IS GOING TO BE INCLUDED THAT

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:17.371
A PROJECT PROPONENT LIKE CAL

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:19.173
FIRE.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.808
WHO WOULD BE THE PROPER PRIMARY

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:22.343
PROJECT FOR BONE ABOARD BUT IS

01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:23.644
BEING SET UP IN A MANNER WHERE A

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:25.579
MYRIAD OF STAKEHOLDERS WE

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.548
ALREADY USE THAT WOULD BE ON A

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:28.983
POLE THAT CHECKLIST OUT?

01:36:29.049 --> 01:36:29.917
LOOK TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.051
ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN PROVIDED AND

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:32.987
DETERMINE IF THE PROJECT FALLS

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:34.121
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:35.556
ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS PROVIDED.

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:37.391
YOU WOULD LITERALLY GO THROUGH

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:39.226
AND AND LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:41.162
RESOURCE SUBJECT MATTER FROM AIR

01:36:41.228 --> 01:36:44.632
QUALITY TO INDIVIDUAL SPECIES --

01:36:44.698 --> 01:36:46.934
TO AESTHETICS AND BE ABLE TO

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:48.536
MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT YOU DO

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:50.337
OR DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:53.073
OF THE PROGRAM YEAH I ARE. FOR

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.708
THEIR PROJECTS BEING ANTICIPATED

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:56.744
IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:57.244
REGION THAT [inaudible]

01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:58.612
WOULD.

01:36:58.679 --> 01:37:00.314
TRY TO DID YOU TRY TO USE THIS

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:01.749
TEARING FOR OR IS IT ALL SORT OF

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:03.651
MOVING ON TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:05.553
RIGHT NOW IN THE SEQUEL --

01:37:05.619 --> 01:37:06.453
WAIVER THERE'S PROJECTS

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.521
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF

01:37:07.588 --> 01:37:09.089
CALIFORNIA WOULD FALL FROM THE

01:37:09.156 --> 01:37:10.724
NORTH FROM THE OREGON BORDER TO

01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:13.160
THE MEXICAN BORDER THAT WOULD

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:14.228
FALL WITHIN THIS.

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:15.129
YET I I'D LIKE TO ADD A LITTLE

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:17.731
BIT TO THAT SO THE THIRTY FIVE

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:18.899
PROJECTS THAT ARE.

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:25.606
UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER -- FOR

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:27.241
FIVE NINETEEN THAT IS -- THOSE

01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:29.243
ARE PARTICULARLY RELATED TO

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:31.478
EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE

01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:33.480
DETERMINED UNDER THAT FORTY FIVE

01:37:33.547 --> 01:37:34.481
DAY REPORT.

01:37:34.548 --> 01:37:37.418
AND AND THEN -- WERE WE WERE

01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:38.419
ORDERED TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THOSE

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:41.155
UNDER EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:37:41.222 --> 01:37:44.024
SO THOSE ALL NEEDED SOME

01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:45.426
EXEMPTION FROM C. C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ALL&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:47.695
TOGETHER -- WE STILL ARE DOING

01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:49.463
THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:50.698
DO AND PRESENTING THAT

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:52.099
INTERNALLY WE ARE DOING THE

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:55.102
PUBLIC FACING PART OF THAT --

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:56.770
AND SO SO WE STILL ARE DOING THE

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:57.838
ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL

01:37:57.905 --> 01:37:59.440
ANALYSIS AND AND MAKING SURE

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:01.508
THAT THE RESOURCES ARE PROTECTED

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.644
FOR THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS.

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.913
BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:08.215
FROM THOSE THOSE THIRTY FIVE

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:09.583
PROJECTS ARE ONES THAT WE WOULD

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:12.019
DEEM TO BE NEED TO DO THIS YEAR

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:13.487
WE'RE GOING TO DO THEM THIS YEAR.

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:16.523
THE THIS IS THE BRIDGE OR THAT'S

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:18.359
THE BRIDGE TO GET TO WHERE WE

01:38:18.425 --> 01:38:20.561
NEED TO BE FOR THIS OF CALVI T.

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:23.897
P. THE CALIFORNIA VEGETATION

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:25.165
TREATMENT PROGRAMMATIC HE I ARE.

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:27.268
ALL OF THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:29.270
IN THE FUTURE WILL BE FOLDED

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:32.139
UNDER THAT DOCUMENT AND IN FACT

01:38:32.206 --> 01:38:34.408
THESE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE DOING.

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:36.777
AS THEY COME UP FOR RENEWAL THE

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:37.544
THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS THEY'LL

01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:39.246
HAVE TO FALL UNDER THIS DOCUMENT

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:40.981
AS WELL THIS DOCUMENT IS.

01:38:41.048 --> 01:38:43.584
THE CORNERSTONE OF OF DOING OUR

01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:45.119
VEGETATION TREATMENT IN THE

01:38:45.185 --> 01:38:46.587
FUTURE UNDERSTOOD SIR DO YOU

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:48.188
ANTICIPATE.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:50.824
USING PRESCRIBED FIRE MORE THAN

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:53.460
THIS SORT OF THE SCIENCE BASE

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:55.329
BURN CYCLES THE SORT OF NATURAL

01:38:55.396 --> 01:38:56.997
BURN CYCLES IN THE CHAPARRAL ARE

01:38:57.064 --> 01:38:58.732
YOU ANTICIPATING DOING MORE

01:38:58.799 --> 01:39:00.801
PRESCRIBED FIRE THAN THAT IN THE

01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:02.002
CHAPARRAL.

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:04.471
GREAT QUESTION -- AND KNOW WHAT

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:06.206
WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR IS

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:08.509
RETURNING -- TO WHAT WOULD BE

01:39:08.575 --> 01:39:10.110
THE FIRE RETURN THAT THAT'S

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:13.714
SCIENTIFICALLY BASED FIRE RETURN --

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.749
INTERVALS THAT OCCUR THROUGHOUT

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:17.918
THE LANDSCAPE -- THERE ARE AREAS

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:19.853
THAT WE WOULD ALSO BE USING THIS

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.855
FOR FUEL REDUCTION FOR COMMUNITY

01:39:21.922 --> 01:39:24.191
PROTECTION IN SOME CASES FOR

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:26.293
PROTECTION OF WATERSHED IN OTHER

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.028
CASES FOR PROTECTION OF

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:29.463
ENDANGERED SPECIES.

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:31.398
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY USE FUEL

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:33.000
REDUCTION.

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.501
TO TRY AND KEEP FIRE OUT OF

01:39:34.568 --> 01:39:37.705
AREAS WE DON'T WANT TO BURN ANY

01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:39.106
MORE FREQUENTLY AS WELL.

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:40.274
SO I'M HERE IN A FIRM COMMITMENT

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:41.875
NOT TO EXCEED SCIENCE BASED FIRE

01:39:41.942 --> 01:39:45.279
INTERVALS GOING FORWARD SEE WHAT

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:47.047
IT LOOKS LIKE IN THE CURRENT.

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:48.582
TAKE THE EXPEDITE THE EMERGENCY

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:51.051
PLANNING AND AND IN FACT.

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:53.987
SB NINE A ONE AND A TWELVE SIXTY

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:56.256
POINT TO MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:39:56.323 --> 01:39:59.126
DON'T -- CONVERT -- FROM.

01:39:59.193 --> 01:40:00.994
A CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE TO A NON

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:03.197
CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE YOU GOT I

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:04.498
MEAN YOU HIT ON THE HEAD LOOK AT

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:06.133
LOOK AT A MUSTARD THAT'S TEN

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:06.900
FEET HIGH.

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:08.035
ALL THROUGH THE BURNS AND WE'LL

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:09.503
SEE AND IT'S A BEAST I MEAN WE

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:10.871
HAVE NO IDEA I MEAN I I DON'T I

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:13.640
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM SINGLE PERSON

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:14.241
WHAT TO DO WITH IT I MEAN YOU

01:40:14.308 --> 01:40:15.209
KNOW.

01:40:15.275 --> 01:40:16.810
YOU TRY TO FIND FUEL BREAKS

01:40:16.877 --> 01:40:18.078
MAYBE MAYBE WERE THE YOU KNOW I

01:40:18.145 --> 01:40:19.947
MEAN WE CAN'T EVEN PUT.

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:22.349
YOU KNOW A PRESCRIBED FIRE CAN

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:23.517
BE TRICKY IN THOSE AREAS BECAUSE

01:40:23.584 --> 01:40:25.085
IT'S SO SENSITIVE ANY AND ANY

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:26.286
INITIAL THING I KNOW A LOT OF

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:27.654
THIS IS KIND OUTSIDE YOUR

01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:29.356
RESPONSIBILITY AREA BUT MEAN

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:30.157
WERE.

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:32.726
WE FEEL AT A LOSS FOR SOLUTIONS

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:33.360
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:35.162
IS.

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:37.831
YEAH SO IT REALLY JUST RELATED

01:40:37.898 --> 01:40:39.032
TO SOME KIND OF THIS THE

01:40:39.099 --> 01:40:41.301
CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE -- FUEL

01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:43.670
BREAK STILL DO WORK -- THEY WORK

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.439
IN EVERY LANDSCAPE -- THE

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:47.207
CRANSTON FIRE IN RIVERSIDE

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:48.809
COUNTY IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:50.444
WHERE THIS DOCUMENT IN THE

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:52.679
FUTURE WOULD BE USED TO MAINTAIN

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:55.382
THAT FUEL BREAK AROUND THE THE

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:56.984
THE THE COMMUNITY OF IDYLLWILD --

01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:59.119
WHICH IS A CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE

01:40:59.186 --> 01:41:00.220
THAT THEN TURNS INTO A PINE

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:03.023
FOREST A LITTLE BIT ABOVE.

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:05.959
AND THE FIRE HIT THE GRANTS AND

01:41:06.026 --> 01:41:08.228
FIRE HIT THAT RENT RIPPED UP BE

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:10.297
CANYON HIT THAT AT A GLANCING

01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:10.998
ANGLE.

01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:13.000
AND WAS DIRECTED AROUND

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:14.768
IDYLLWILD IDYLLWILD COULD HAVE

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.336
LOOKED LIKE PORTIONS OF OF

01:41:16.403 --> 01:41:18.906
PARADISE OR COFFEE PARK --

01:41:18.972 --> 01:41:20.874
EASILY LAST SUMMER AND IT DIDN'T

01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:22.743
BECAUSE WE HAD A FUEL BREAK IN

01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:23.744
THE RIGHT PLACE.

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:25.546
SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT I

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.514

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:29.116
YOUR LIST AT THIRTY FIVE OR IN

01:41:29.183 --> 01:41:31.051
CHAPARRAL AREAS.

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:32.853
ARE THOSE THE KINDS OF PROJECTS

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.421
THAT YOU'RE IT IS A MORE FUEL

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:36.089
BREAK ORIENTED LESS PRESCRIBED

01:41:36.156 --> 01:41:37.858
FIRE ORIENTED WOULD YOU SAY ON

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:38.559
THE WHOLE.

01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:40.894
IT IS IT IS FOR THESE THIRTY

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:42.596
FIVE PROJECTS AND EVEN GOING

01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:44.064
FORWARD SIR TO OPEN TO THAT

01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:46.266
STRATEGY JUST.

WHAT COMES BACK IS INVASIVE

01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:54.074
SPECIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:54.708
WHAT I'M HEARING THAT'S NOT THE

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:55.909

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:35.955
STATE PARK THAT MAKES US

02:06:36.021 --> 02:06:38.490
VULNERABLE. TO THINGS LIKE --

02:06:38.557 --> 02:06:39.992
EROSION AND THE SLIDING OF

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:41.827
DEBRIS FROM THE HILL SIDE I WAS

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:46.999
THERE TWO WEEKS AGO -- AND YOU

02:06:47.066 --> 02:06:47.633
KNOW SIX MONTHS PRIOR YOU WERE

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:48.667
ABLE TO WALK UNDER A ROADWAY AND

02:06:48.734 --> 02:06:50.536
NOW IT'S FILLED WITH DEBRIS AND

02:06:50.602 --> 02:06:52.004
MUD SO WE ARE ALREADY IN THERE

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:54.406
WITH CREWS -- CLEANING THAT UP I

02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:55.407
THINK THE FIRST THING WE DO IS

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:57.042
WE THINK ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:58.777
WE WANT TO OPEN THE PARK BACK.

02:06:58.844 --> 02:06:59.712
TO LEO CARILLO CURRENTLY IS

02:06:59.778 --> 02:07:01.680
CLOSE WE ANTICIPATE RE OPENING

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:05.084
IT BY THE END OF MAY -- WE LOST --

02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:06.652
ALL OF OUR HEAVY EQUIPMENT DOWN

02:07:06.719 --> 02:07:08.887
IN THAT AREA WAS WERE BURNED AND

02:07:08.954 --> 02:07:12.191
SO WE IMMEDIATELY -- SOLVE THAT

02:07:12.257 --> 02:07:14.126
THROUGH KIND OF REDISTRIBUTING.

02:07:14.193 --> 02:07:15.928
HEAVY EQUIPMENT THROUGHOUT OUR

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:18.030
OWN STATE DEPARTMENT -- BUT WHAT

02:07:18.097 --> 02:07:19.598
I EXPECT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN

02:07:19.665 --> 02:07:21.400
THE LIST TOMORROW IS A REAL

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:23.569
FOCUS ON PLANNING AND TAKING A

02:07:23.635 --> 02:07:25.237
LOOK AT ALL OF THE FACILITIES

02:07:25.304 --> 02:07:27.006
AND SO I THINK PUBLIC SAFETY

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:28.207
COMES FIRST THE THINGS THAT

02:07:28.273 --> 02:07:28.974
PREVENT US.

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:30.609
FROM BEING ABLE TO RE OPEN THE

02:07:30.676 --> 02:07:33.846
PARK -- REST FACILITIES SO THOSE

02:07:33.912 --> 02:07:35.314
THINGS THAT HAVE THE MOST DIRECT

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:37.549
IMPACT ON A VISITOR'S EXPERIENCE

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:40.252
BUT WE EXPECT THIS TO BE A MULTI

02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:41.787
YEAR PHASED EFFORT.

02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:43.922
ALEJO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THE

02:07:43.989 --> 02:07:47.126
MALIBU CREEK OR LEO CARILLO

02:07:47.192 --> 02:07:48.527
STATE PARKS.

02:07:48.594 --> 02:07:49.828
SURE SO.

02:07:49.895 --> 02:07:51.030
I THINK ARC ARE COMMENTS ON THIS

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:53.132
WHEN AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:54.733

FROM OTHER FIRES AS WELL AND AND

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:04.710
SO IT'S IT'S TOTALLY REASONABLE

02:08:04.777 --> 02:08:06.478
FOR AND PARKS TO YOU NEED

02:08:06.545 --> 02:08:08.280

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:10.516
THE DAMAGE AND ONE OF THE THE

02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:12.051
CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED IS THAT

02:08:12.117 --> 02:08:13.786
THAT PROPOSAL THAT WAS --

02:08:13.852 --> 02:08:15.621

PROJECTS I AM ARE UNDERSTANDING

02:08:18.891 --> 02:08:20.459
IS THAT PART OF THIS FUNDING --

02:08:28.667 --> 02:08:29.535
IDENTIFIED.

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:30.536
AND AND SO WE JUST THINK THAT

02:08:30.602 --> 02:08:31.770

02:19:53.418 --> 02:19:54.853
LEAST ONE LOSS OF LIFE.

02:19:54.919 --> 02:19:56.121
AND THAT'S BY THE FEDERAL

02:19:56.187 --> 02:19:59.390
DEFINITION -- SINCE HAZARD

02:19:59.457 --> 02:20:01.393
POTENTIAL DOESN'T REALLY --

02:20:01.459 --> 02:20:02.494
INDICATE.

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:05.130
AS THE SAFETY OF THE DAM WE

02:20:05.196 --> 02:20:06.397
CONDUCT BOTH -- FIELD

02:20:06.464 --> 02:20:09.134
INSPECTIONS IN RE EVALUATIONS TO

02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:12.170
ASSESS THE SAFETY OF THE DAM.

02:20:12.237 --> 02:20:14.172
TRADITIONALLY WE'VE BEEN DOING

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:16.341
THIS ACTUALLY SINCE -- THE

02:20:16.407 --> 02:20:18.309
FAILURE OF THIS -- BALDWIN HILLS

02:20:18.376 --> 02:20:20.278
DAM THAT OCCURRED IN THE SIXTIES

02:20:20.345 --> 02:20:21.646
THAT'S WHEN OUR PROGRAM FIRST

02:20:21.713 --> 02:20:23.815
STARTED READ LOOKING AT DAMS.

02:20:23.882 --> 02:20:26.050
BECAUSE BY THEN THOSE DAMS WORD

02:20:26.117 --> 02:20:28.119
NEARLY AGING FIFTY YEARS AT THAT

02:20:28.186 --> 02:20:29.320
TIME RIGHT.

02:20:29.387 --> 02:20:30.822
AND CONDITIONS HAD CHANGED

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:32.690
BECAUSE OF DOWNSTREAM POPULATION

02:20:32.757 --> 02:20:33.858
INCREASE.

02:20:33.925 --> 02:20:35.693
IN SO WITH THAT IF YOU MOVE

02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:37.195
AHEAD INTO THE EARLY SEVENTIES

02:20:37.262 --> 02:20:38.329
WE HAD THE SAN FERNANDO

02:20:38.396 --> 02:20:40.465
EARTHQUAKE.

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:41.833
THAT NEARLY I WILL FAILED THE

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:43.601
UPSTREAM OF LOWER SAN FERNANDO

02:20:43.668 --> 02:20:44.536
DAM.

02:20:44.602 --> 02:20:45.970
AND ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:20:46.037 --> 02:20:47.539
WERE EVACUATED IN THAT REALLY

02:20:47.605 --> 02:20:48.873
TRIGGERED THE ONSET OF

02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:51.409
UNDERSTANDING SEISMIC IN THE

02:20:51.476 --> 02:20:52.143
STATE.

02:20:52.210 --> 02:20:53.645
AND SINCE THAT TIME SEISMIC

02:20:53.711 --> 02:20:55.680
EVALUATIONS HAS BEEN A BIG FOCUS

02:20:55.747 --> 02:20:58.183
OF THE PROGRAM BUT IT'S BEEN A

02:20:58.249 --> 02:21:00.051
VERY FOCUSED -- EVALUATION

02:21:00.118 --> 02:21:02.020
APPROACH IN A VERY TRADITIONAL

02:21:02.086 --> 02:21:04.289
APPROACH SO WE WOULD LOOK AT

02:21:04.355 --> 02:21:05.323
WHAT'S THE HIGHEST RISK FOR

02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:07.926
DANCING IN CALIFORNIA GIVEN OUR

02:21:07.992 --> 02:21:09.561
OUR COMPLEX GEOLOGY IN OUR

02:21:09.627 --> 02:21:11.629
SEISMIC ACTIVITY IT'S IT'S BEEN

02:21:11.696 --> 02:21:12.664
SEISMIC.

02:21:12.730 --> 02:21:14.499
AND SO WITH THAT WE FOCUSED ON

02:21:14.566 --> 02:21:18.102
SIZE MAKING WE'VE ALSO FOCUSED --

02:21:18.169 --> 02:21:20.205
AS INCIDENTS OCCUR SO WE HAVE

02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:22.574
THAT A FULSOME GATE FILL YOUR

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:23.241
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE SO WE DID A

02:21:23.308 --> 02:21:25.276
SPECIAL STUDY OF RADIO GATES.

02:21:25.343 --> 02:21:27.478
IN THE STATE -- AND SO WITH THAT

02:21:27.545 --> 02:21:29.848
APPROACH WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT

02:21:29.914 --> 02:21:31.416
PARTICULAR FAILURE MODES.

02:21:31.482 --> 02:21:33.151
A YOU KNOW A SINGLE TYPE OF

02:21:33.218 --> 02:21:35.553
FAILURE MODE FOR AS A DAM AND WE

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.722
WOULD BE LOOKING AT DOES IT DOES.

02:21:37.789 --> 02:21:39.057
HOW DOES THE DEMAND IN THE

02:21:39.123 --> 02:21:41.392
CAPACITY RELATE TO EACH OTHER

02:21:41.459 --> 02:21:43.261
AND WE WOULD COME UP LIKE WITH

02:21:43.328 --> 02:21:44.128
THE FACTOR OF SAFETY?

02:21:44.195 --> 02:21:46.531
I AM GOING FORWARD SO THAT

02:21:46.598 --> 02:21:49.167
METHOD HAD HAD PROVEN PROVEN OUT

02:21:49.234 --> 02:21:51.469
WELL WE WERE YOU KNOW WITH THE

02:21:51.536 --> 02:21:54.405
STANDARDS AT THE TIME -- BUT

02:21:54.472 --> 02:21:55.640
THAT'S A VERY.

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:57.775
LABOR INTENSIVE WAY TO DO RE

02:21:57.842 --> 02:21:59.277
EVALUATIONS AND SO WE ONLY GET

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:01.379
THROUGH ABOUT TEN TO TWENTY DAMS

02:22:01.446 --> 02:22:03.581
A YEAR WITH THAT APPROACH.

02:22:03.648 --> 02:22:05.316
AND AGAIN WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT

02:22:05.383 --> 02:22:06.518
ONE FAILURE MODE SO IF THEY DARE

02:22:06.584 --> 02:22:08.786
MEETS THE SEISMIC FAILURE MODE

02:22:08.853 --> 02:22:10.355
WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT DOWN. FOR

02:22:10.421 --> 02:22:12.090
SEISMIC WE DON'T SIT THERE AND

02:22:12.156 --> 02:22:13.825
LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF

02:22:13.892 --> 02:22:16.661
THE DAM COMPREHENSIVELY AND LOOK

02:22:16.728 --> 02:22:18.997
AT HOW ELSE COULD THIS DIEM FAIL.

02:22:19.063 --> 02:22:19.797
NO COULD HAVE FAILED THROUGH THE

02:22:19.864 --> 02:22:21.432
OUTLET PIPE COULD FAIL THROUGH

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:23.468
THE SPILL WAY WHAT OTHER MEANS

02:22:23.534 --> 02:22:27.505
WOULD BECAUSE THE FAILURE.

02:22:27.572 --> 02:22:29.841
SO -- WITH THAT WE HAVE AB

02:22:29.908 --> 02:22:31.209
TWELVE SEVENTY THAT WAS ENACTED

02:22:31.276 --> 02:22:32.377
JUST LAST YEAR.

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:34.646
AND NOW IS ACTUALLY ENACTED

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:36.281
UNDER EMERGENCY CLAUSE.

02:22:36.347 --> 02:22:38.650
IN IT REQUIRED OUR PROGRAMS TO

02:22:38.716 --> 02:22:39.684
HAVE.

02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:42.620
A A PEER REVIEW. TO A CONVENE A

02:22:42.687 --> 02:22:44.789
PANEL OF INDEPENDENT EXPERTS OF

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:47.225
DAM SAFETY FROM NATIONAL DAM

02:22:47.292 --> 02:22:48.593
SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS.

02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:50.528
AND IN PARTICULAR THE LANGUAGE

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:52.263
IN THE LEGISLATION STATED WE

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:54.999
ALSO HAD TO HAVE RISK MANAGEMENT.

02:22:55.066 --> 02:22:59.037
INCORPORATED INTO OUR PROTOCOLS.

02:22:59.103 --> 02:23:00.338
IN SO WELL WITH THAT DIRECTIVE

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:03.775
LAST YEAR WE CONVENED A PANEL OF

02:23:03.841 --> 02:23:05.743
HIGHLY RECOGNIZED EXPERTS IN DAM

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:06.945
SAFETY.

02:23:07.011 --> 02:23:09.113
WE HAD FOURTEEN MEMBERS AND WE

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:10.949
HAD REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE

02:23:11.015 --> 02:23:12.750
ASSOCIATION A STATE DAM SAFETY

02:23:12.817 --> 02:23:13.952
OFFICIALS.

02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:17.188
WE HAD THE US SOCIETY ON DAMS.

02:23:17.255 --> 02:23:19.123
AND WE HAD THE ARMY CORPS OF

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:21.726
ENGINEERS AS SPECIALLY FOR THEIR

02:23:21.793 --> 02:23:23.227
EXPERTISE AND RISK.

02:23:23.294 --> 02:23:24.862
AND WE ALSO HAD THE U. S. BUREAU

02:23:24.929 --> 02:23:26.998
OF RECLAMATION AGAIN FOR THEIR

02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:28.499
EXPERTISE AND RISK.

02:23:28.566 --> 02:23:29.968
SO WE HAD A VERY COMPREHENSIVE

02:23:30.034 --> 02:23:32.136
PANEL WE ALSO HAD OTHER STATE

02:23:32.203 --> 02:23:35.306
REGULATORS ON THE PANEL WE HAD --

02:23:35.373 --> 02:23:37.542
A FEW DAM OWNERS -- TENNESSEE

02:23:37.608 --> 02:23:39.277
VALLEY AUTHORITY WAS ANOTHER

02:23:39.344 --> 02:23:41.479
MEMBER OF THE PANEL AND WE HAD

02:23:41.546 --> 02:23:44.182
SOME CONSULTANTS.

02:23:44.248 --> 02:23:45.817
ON THE PANEL SO IT WAS A REALLY.

02:23:45.883 --> 02:23:46.818
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD PANEL AND

02:23:46.884 --> 02:23:48.519
SO WE MET AT THREE TIMES LAST

02:23:48.586 --> 02:23:51.255
YEAR IN IN PERSON THEY ALL CAME

02:23:51.322 --> 02:23:53.157
TO SACRAMENTO WE PRESENTED OUR

02:23:53.224 --> 02:23:54.792
PROGRAM TO THEM.

02:23:54.859 --> 02:23:57.028
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH

02:23:57.095 --> 02:23:59.230
THEIR SOUL RECOMMENDATION IS

02:23:59.297 --> 02:24:01.566
CALIFORNIA YOU NEED TO BE DOING

02:24:01.632 --> 02:24:02.700
RISK.

02:24:02.767 --> 02:24:04.268
WHICH IS WHICH IS.

02:24:04.335 --> 02:24:06.037
NO WE WEREN'T SURPRISED -- THE

02:24:06.104 --> 02:24:08.172
INTERSTATE HE HAD ADVANCED QUITE

02:24:08.239 --> 02:24:10.208
A BIT PROBABLY IN THE LAST

02:24:10.274 --> 02:24:11.175
TWENTY YEARS.

02:24:11.242 --> 02:24:12.744
IN TERMS OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND

02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:14.779
DAM SAFETY AND THAT WAS

02:24:14.846 --> 02:24:16.814
SOMETHING WE HAD NOT YET --

02:24:16.881 --> 02:24:18.583
STARTED DOING WE DID IT AND

02:24:18.649 --> 02:24:20.284
FORMALLY WE CONSIDERED RISK

02:24:20.351 --> 02:24:21.652
OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:24:21.719 --> 02:24:22.653
EARTHQUAKES WERE LOOKING AT THE

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.989
PROBABILITY OF THE EARTHQUAKE.

02:24:25.056 --> 02:24:26.457
BUT NOT TO THE FORMALIZED

02:24:26.524 --> 02:24:28.626
METHODOLOGIES THAT THE ARMY

02:24:28.693 --> 02:24:30.194
CORPS AND THE BUREAU OF

02:24:30.261 --> 02:24:32.330
RECLAMATION DO FOR THEIR DAMS.

02:24:32.397 --> 02:24:34.132
AND THEY THOUGHT BASED ON THE

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:36.334
SIZE OF OUR PROGRAM AND BEING

02:24:36.401 --> 02:24:37.769
THE LARGEST STAMP SAFETY PROGRAM

02:24:37.835 --> 02:24:40.004
IN THE NATION WE REALLY NEEDED

02:24:40.071 --> 02:24:42.206
TO IMPLEMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

02:24:42.273 --> 02:24:43.508
INTO OUR PROGRAM.

02:24:43.574 --> 02:24:44.976
AND SO THAT'S THE PROPOSAL

02:24:45.043 --> 02:24:47.111
THAT'S IN THE B. C. P. IT'S FOR

02:24:47.178 --> 02:24:48.479
SIX POSITIONS.

02:24:48.546 --> 02:24:51.349
AND AT A COST OF ONE POINT SIX

02:24:51.416 --> 02:24:52.216
TWO FIVE MILLION.

02:24:52.283 --> 02:24:54.552
WE'VE RECENTLY INCREASED OUR OUR

02:24:54.619 --> 02:24:55.753
DAM FEES.

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:58.356
AND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS ARE

02:24:58.423 --> 02:25:01.359
DAM FEES HAVE GONE UP ABOUT 55%.

02:25:01.426 --> 02:25:03.227
AND SO THE PROPOSAL IN THE B. C.

02:25:03.294 --> 02:25:07.265
P. IS TO ACTUALLY -- HAVE A LOAN

02:25:07.331 --> 02:25:09.400
FORGIVENESS FOR THE NEXT THREE

02:25:09.467 --> 02:25:10.435
YEARS OF PAYMENT OF OUR GENERAL

02:25:10.501 --> 02:25:13.337
FUND LOAN THAT WE RECEIVED IN.

02:25:13.404 --> 02:25:14.739
TWO YEARS AGO.

02:25:14.806 --> 02:25:16.207
AND THAT WOULD M. COMPLETELY

02:25:16.274 --> 02:25:17.909
OFFSET ANY FEE INCREASES THAT

02:25:17.975 --> 02:25:19.410
WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THIS

02:25:19.477 --> 02:25:22.313
PROPOSAL [inaudible]

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:23.448
THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:25:23.514 --> 02:25:26.184
SO.

02:25:26.250 --> 02:25:29.387
THESE ARE PRIVATELY OWNED DAMS.

02:25:29.454 --> 02:25:31.823
THAT THE STATE IS INSPECTING FOR

02:25:31.889 --> 02:25:34.225
THE RISK ANALYSIS AND THE SAFETY.

02:25:34.292 --> 02:25:39.063
CORRECT SO WE HAVE -- WE HAVE.

02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:41.466
S. ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:25:41.532 --> 02:25:42.600
NINE DAM OWNERS.

02:25:42.667 --> 02:25:45.203
AND IT'S COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE

02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:46.204
TYPE OF OWNERS YOU GOT THE STATE

02:25:46.270 --> 02:25:48.106
OF CALIFORNIA AS AN OWNER YOU

02:25:48.172 --> 02:25:49.507
HAVE COUNTIES.

02:25:49.574 --> 02:25:51.175
YOU OF WATER DISTRICTS YOU HAVE

02:25:51.242 --> 02:25:52.510
IRRIGATION DISTRICTS.

02:25:52.577 --> 02:25:54.912
YOU HAVE PRIVATE CITIZENS

02:25:54.979 --> 02:25:56.681
FARMERS AND RANCHERS YOU HAVE

02:25:56.747 --> 02:25:59.417
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS.

02:25:59.484 --> 02:26:00.985
A IS SO IT'S A IT'S ACROSS THE

02:26:01.052 --> 02:26:03.254
GAMUT OF THE TYPE OF OWNERSHIP.

02:26:03.321 --> 02:26:04.889
MUST BE FROM WHEN YOU GUYS ALL

02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:07.725
GET TOGETHER SO -- AND SOME OF

02:26:07.792 --> 02:26:09.727
THESE DAMS WERE BUILT OBVIOUSLY

02:26:09.794 --> 02:26:11.929
AT DIFFERENT TIMES WERE RISK

02:26:11.996 --> 02:26:14.298
ANALYSIS WAS.

02:26:14.365 --> 02:26:15.633
HOCUS POCUS PEOPLE YEAH YOU

02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:17.802
BUILT YOUR YOU OFFER YOU YOU HAD

02:26:17.869 --> 02:26:20.104
TO USE THAT YOU HAD BUT THERE

02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:21.639
WAS NO STATE.

02:26:21.706 --> 02:26:23.941
RISK MANAGEMENT CROWD COMING

02:26:24.008 --> 02:26:27.044
INTO TO LOOK TO LOOK AT YOUR

02:26:27.111 --> 02:26:30.314
YOUR DAM -- SO.

02:26:30.381 --> 02:26:33.484
I'M TRYING TO EVALUATE I GET THE

02:26:33.551 --> 02:26:36.320
ONE POINT SIX MILLION AND I GET

02:26:36.387 --> 02:26:37.655

THESE LOANS PAID BACK TO THE

02:26:43.861 --> 02:26:46.831
STATE SO THAT THE OR FORGIVE THE

02:26:46.898 --> 02:26:49.901
LOANS SO THAT THE DAM OWNERS.

02:26:49.967 --> 02:26:50.801
WILL.

02:26:50.868 --> 02:26:52.904

IT I GET IT I GUESS THE QUESTION

02:26:58.209 --> 02:26:58.743
IS BIGGER PICTURE [inaudible]

02:26:58.809 --> 02:27:00.578
IS THAT.

02:27:00.645 --> 02:27:02.380
IF WE DON'T OWN THAT ADVOCATE

02:27:02.446 --> 02:27:03.714
SOME OF THE STATE TAKE THE STATE

02:27:03.781 --> 02:27:05.516
DAMS OUT IF THESE ARE OWNED BY

02:27:05.583 --> 02:27:08.085
OTHER PEOPLE OR OTHER ENTITIES

02:27:08.152 --> 02:27:10.054
AND THEY CREATE A RISK.

02:27:10.121 --> 02:27:11.222
NOT TODAY WE THOUGHT IT WAS

02:27:11.289 --> 02:27:12.623
GONNA BE REST WHEN THEY BUILT IT

02:27:12.690 --> 02:27:15.626
BUT THERE'S REST NOW -- AND NOW

02:27:15.693 --> 02:27:17.562
WE'RE GOING TO GET. SIX MORE

02:27:17.628 --> 02:27:20.831
PEOPLE OUT THERE DOING THE SUPER

02:27:20.898 --> 02:27:22.700
DUPER RISK MANAGEMENT ON DAMS

02:27:22.767 --> 02:27:25.136
NOT JUST EARTHQUAKE OR NOT JUST

02:27:25.203 --> 02:27:27.471
SPILL WAY BECAUSE I GET.

02:27:27.538 --> 02:27:29.440
YOU KNOW WE TEN THE OVER

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:32.176
OVERSIMPLIFICATION RESPOND TO

02:27:32.243 --> 02:27:35.112
HERE'S A CATASTROPHE PLEASE HELP

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:37.315
MY DISTRICT OUT HELP THIS AND

02:27:37.381 --> 02:27:39.517
AND NOW DO THIS GET THESE PEOPLE

02:27:39.584 --> 02:27:41.652
TO INSPECTED THEY'RE NOT OUR

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:43.187
DAMS I MEAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:27:43.254 --> 02:27:44.255
THEY'RE PART OF OUR SYSTEM AND

02:27:44.322 --> 02:27:47.391
WE WANT TO PROTECT LIFE AND LIMB.

02:27:47.458 --> 02:27:48.226
LIFE AND ALL THAT SO WE'RE

02:27:48.292 --> 02:27:51.395
CONCERNED ABOUT IT BUT HOW DO WE

02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:53.231
OKAY SAID THE SAID THERE'S A

02:27:53.297 --> 02:27:55.900
JUSTIFICATION THAT WE'RE THE

02:27:55.967 --> 02:27:58.736
FACT -- SUBSIDIZING THE PRIVATE

02:27:58.803 --> 02:28:00.071
OWNERS IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:02.206
BACK THE LOANS THAT THEY OWN --

02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:05.209
BUT BUT IS THE IS THE IDEA THAT.

02:28:05.276 --> 02:28:06.510
IN THREE YEARS THEY'RE GOING TO

02:28:06.577 --> 02:28:08.946
JUST HAVE TO PASS ON RATES TO

02:28:09.013 --> 02:28:10.848
WATER USERS OR DO WHATEVER THEY

02:28:10.915 --> 02:28:12.116
NEED TO DO TO GET THEIR

02:28:12.183 --> 02:28:13.551
FINANCIAL HOUSE.

02:28:13.618 --> 02:28:16.387
IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THAT.

02:28:16.454 --> 02:28:18.222
NOT ONLY JUST THE ANALYSIS OF

02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:19.490
YOU YOUR FOLKS TO SAY THIS IS

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:22.093
WRONG THIS IS WRONG BUT FIX IT.

02:28:22.159 --> 02:28:23.527
YOU KNOW DO WAY WOULD NEED TO BE

02:28:23.594 --> 02:28:24.695
DONE IS THAT.

02:28:24.762 --> 02:28:26.097
THE PLAY HERE.

02:28:26.163 --> 02:28:27.398
WELL SO I THINK WE'VE ALWAYS

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:29.400
DONE RISK MANAGEMENT IN TERMS OF

02:28:29.467 --> 02:28:31.235
WHAT WE GO WHAT WE WANT TO

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:32.436
CONCENTRATE A WE GO OUT TO

02:28:32.503 --> 02:28:34.205
REVIEW DAM SAFETY OKAY WE

02:28:34.272 --> 02:28:35.339
REQUIRED REVIEW THE DAMS

02:28:35.406 --> 02:28:36.407
ANNUALLY.

02:28:36.474 --> 02:28:37.208
SO WE MAY BE LOOKING AT

02:28:37.275 --> 02:28:38.943
SPILLWAYS A MAY BE LOOKING AT

02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:39.710
THE DAM STRUCTURES ITSELF.

02:28:39.777 --> 02:28:41.312
WHAT THIS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

02:28:41.379 --> 02:28:43.781
IS TO INCORPORATE THIS RISK OF

02:28:43.848 --> 02:28:44.482
FOR MANAGEMENT THIS IS A

02:28:44.548 --> 02:28:46.484
PROCESSES USED BY THE CORPS OF

02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:47.318
ENGINEERS?

02:28:47.385 --> 02:28:49.353
AND AND THE US BUREAU INTO OUR

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:51.289
THINKING AS TO HOW WE AS

02:28:51.355 --> 02:28:52.990
REGULATORS IN CALIFORNIA OF

02:28:53.057 --> 02:28:55.726
THESE DAMS CAN MORE QUICKLY ZERO

02:28:55.793 --> 02:28:57.094
IN ON THOSE TO HAVE SERIOUS

02:28:57.161 --> 02:28:58.362
PROBLEMS.

02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:59.897
AND THEN WORK WITH THOSE OWNERS

02:28:59.964 --> 02:29:01.232
TO MAKE SURE THE CORRECT THOSE

02:29:01.299 --> 02:29:04.168
PROBLEMS SO IT'S KIND OF A A UGH.

02:29:04.235 --> 02:29:05.836
MOVING INTO THE THE STATED THE

02:29:05.903 --> 02:29:07.872
PRACTICE IF YOU WILL IN TERMS OF

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:10.007
HOW WE APPROACH WHAT ARE JOBS

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:12.843
ARE IN REGARDS -- TO MANAGING --

02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:14.512
DETERMINING WHAT THAT RISK OF

02:29:14.578 --> 02:29:16.013
THOSE DAMS ARE OUT THERE BUT I

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:17.415
GOT TO BELIEVE THAT SOME OF

02:29:17.481 --> 02:29:19.984
THESE DAMS WERE BUILT FIFTY

02:29:20.051 --> 02:29:22.386
SIXTY YEARS AGO WITH NOT.

02:29:22.453 --> 02:29:23.721
EVEN WHEN THEY WERE BUILT THEY

02:29:23.788 --> 02:29:25.856
WERE NOT TOPLINE DAMS IF YOU

02:29:25.923 --> 02:29:26.590
COULD IF I COULD SAY THAT YOU

02:29:26.657 --> 02:29:28.225
KNOW THE WHATEVER THEY WERE JUST

02:29:28.292 --> 02:29:29.260
BUILT BECAUSE HE NEEDED AN

02:29:29.327 --> 02:29:31.228
IRRIGATION SYSTEM OR WHATEVER

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:32.763
WHEREVER PEOPLE WERE DOING AND

02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:34.098
NOW WE'VE GOT.

02:29:34.165 --> 02:29:36.267
PEOPLE LIVE IN IN THE IN THE

02:29:36.334 --> 02:29:37.435
AREA SOME PEOPLE LIVE IN THEIR

02:29:37.501 --> 02:29:38.703
NATIVE DID THERE'S BEEN.

02:29:38.769 --> 02:29:40.504
OTHER DECISIONS NOT THE STATE'S

02:29:40.571 --> 02:29:42.707
DECISIONS OTHER LOCAL DECISIONS

02:29:42.773 --> 02:29:44.308
THAT HAVE PT PEOPLE IN HARM'S

02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:46.911
WAY -- THAT YOU GUYS ARE

02:29:46.977 --> 02:29:51.916
EVALUATING TAT.

02:29:51.982 --> 02:29:56.120
HE BUT YOU WANT TO DO IT ANYWAY

02:29:56.187 --> 02:29:57.154
NO I GUESS NOT.

02:29:57.221 --> 02:29:58.222
WHAT TO DO THE EVALUATION TO SEE

02:29:58.289 --> 02:29:59.890
WHO THE IT'S PART OF WHAT WE DO

02:29:59.957 --> 02:30:00.358
I MEAN THAT'S FINE?

02:30:00.424 --> 02:30:01.292
WHAT WE DO IN TERMS THAT'S WHO

02:30:01.359 --> 02:30:02.393
WE ARE IT'S WHAT WE ARE IN TERMS

02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:03.861
OF REGULATION OF DAMS YES AND

02:30:03.928 --> 02:30:05.363
SAFETY AND IS BITING FOR THAT

02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:05.996
SAFETY A DOWNSTREAM AND YOU'RE

02:30:06.063 --> 02:30:07.531
CORRECT OVER THE YEARS OVER THE

02:30:07.598 --> 02:30:08.599
DECADES?

02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:10.267
THERE THAT SAFETY CONCERN HAS

02:30:10.334 --> 02:30:12.169
GROWN BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVED INTO

02:30:12.236 --> 02:30:14.138
THE BOTTOM NEXT TO THEM SO HOLD

02:30:14.205 --> 02:30:14.972
ON TO MAKE SURE THOSE DAMS ARE

02:30:15.039 --> 02:30:17.007
AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AND THIS IS

02:30:17.074 --> 02:30:18.776
A METHODOLOGY A WAY OF THINKING.

02:30:18.843 --> 02:30:20.077
OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE

02:30:20.144 --> 02:30:22.079
SO WHAT POWER DOES THE STATE

02:30:22.146 --> 02:30:26.751
HAVE TO TELL A DAM OWNER

02:30:26.817 --> 02:30:28.919
[inaudible] TWO TAKE DOWN YOUR

02:30:28.986 --> 02:30:29.553
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR OR JUST

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:30.855
THERE'S NO THERE'S NO REPAIR

02:30:30.921 --> 02:30:33.524
WORK THIS COULD GO ON HERE GIVEN

02:30:33.591 --> 02:30:34.792
THE NEW ANALYSIS THAT ARE

02:30:34.859 --> 02:30:37.762
[inaudible] SIX INFORMED WRIST.

02:30:37.828 --> 02:30:40.297
DECISION MAKING DAM SAFETY.

02:30:40.364 --> 02:30:42.967
FOLKS ARE GOING TO DO. THIRTY

02:30:43.033 --> 02:30:44.135
EIGHT DEMENTORS STATE THEY HAVE

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:45.903
A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY HAM

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:47.972
LIABILITY SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE

02:30:48.038 --> 02:30:49.807
OBVIOUSLY RESPONSIBLE THEY FULLY

02:30:49.874 --> 02:30:51.709
FOUNDER PROGRAM AS IT IS RIGHT

02:30:51.776 --> 02:30:52.843
NOW.

02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:54.545
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE THEY'VE

02:30:54.612 --> 02:30:56.847
BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR AND

02:30:56.914 --> 02:30:58.649
DEVELOPING THEIR INUNDATION MAPS.

02:30:58.716 --> 02:31:00.985
THE LEGISLATION AS BE NINETY TWO

02:31:01.051 --> 02:31:03.421
THEY'RE EA PEAS WE'VE HAD --

02:31:03.487 --> 02:31:04.722
QUITE A FEW OF THEM GO OUT AND

02:31:04.789 --> 02:31:06.056
DO CONDITION ASSESSMENTS ON

02:31:06.123 --> 02:31:08.392
THEIR SPILLWAYS GET DATA.

02:31:08.459 --> 02:31:10.494
AND WHENEVER WE COME UP WITH A

02:31:10.561 --> 02:31:11.962
DEFICIENCY.

02:31:12.029 --> 02:31:13.130
THEY HAVE TO GO OUT AND GET A

02:31:13.197 --> 02:31:15.366
CONSULTING ENGINEER THEY HAVE TO

02:31:15.433 --> 02:31:17.168
ALSO ANALYZE IT THEY HAVE TO

02:31:17.234 --> 02:31:18.536
COME UP WITH A PLAN TO FIX IT

02:31:18.602 --> 02:31:19.970
AND THEY HAVE TO FIND THE

02:31:20.037 --> 02:31:21.839
FUNDING TO FIX IT.

02:31:21.906 --> 02:31:24.074
AND SO ULTIMATELY THE DAY BEAR

02:31:24.141 --> 02:31:26.877
THAT BIG TICKET COST ON DAM

02:31:26.944 --> 02:31:29.580
OWNERSHIP AND WHAT THIS DOES IS

02:31:29.647 --> 02:31:31.482
ALLOW US TO GET THREE WHERE I

02:31:31.549 --> 02:31:33.951
MENTIONED WE DO TEND TO TWENTY A

02:31:34.018 --> 02:31:34.852
YEAR.

02:31:34.919 --> 02:31:36.887
THE GOAL WITH THIS IS A SIX

02:31:36.954 --> 02:31:37.888
HUNDRED AND FIFTY HIGH HAZARD

02:31:37.955 --> 02:31:39.857
DAMS WE WOULD BE EVALUATING THEM

02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:42.026
ABOUT EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS.

02:31:42.092 --> 02:31:43.127
RIGHT.

02:31:43.194 --> 02:31:46.197
ALL OF THEM NOT TEN TO TWENTY A

02:31:46.263 --> 02:31:47.932
YEAR WHICH WOULD TAKE IS. THREE

02:31:47.998 --> 02:31:50.935
DECADES TO GET HER AND HENCE

02:31:51.001 --> 02:31:52.169
WE'RE GONNA FIND GIVE YOU THIS

02:31:52.236 --> 02:31:54.171
LITTLE LOAN BALANCE WILL FORGIVE

02:31:54.238 --> 02:31:55.706
THAT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS

02:31:55.773 --> 02:31:59.009
AND THE BIG THE BIG CHALLENGES

02:31:59.076 --> 02:32:01.946
THE BIG -- TICKET ITEMS PRICE

02:32:02.012 --> 02:32:02.513
TICKET ITEMS ARE GOING TO BE

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:07.318
THERE.

02:32:07.384 --> 02:32:09.053
ELLIE -- AND THEN SENT.

02:32:09.119 --> 02:32:10.454
THE FEES THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:32:10.521 --> 02:32:11.956
CHARGING THE DEMOS HAVE ALREADY

02:32:12.022 --> 02:32:14.792
BEEN RAISED SO THEY WERE RAISED.

02:32:14.859 --> 02:32:16.327
35% IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THEY

02:32:16.393 --> 02:32:18.395
WILL BE REYES 20% AGAIN IN THE

02:32:18.462 --> 02:32:20.798
BUDGET YEAR TO COVER THE COSTS

02:32:20.865 --> 02:32:22.566
OF SOME OF THE PREVIOUS

02:32:22.633 --> 02:32:24.034
INCREASED ACTIVITIES THE

02:32:24.101 --> 02:32:25.369
DEPARTMENT'S REQUIRING SO THE

02:32:25.436 --> 02:32:27.571
INUNDATION MAPS AND THE

02:32:27.638 --> 02:32:29.507
EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS. FOR

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:30.841
THOSE THOSE COSTS ARE ALREADY

02:32:30.908 --> 02:32:32.610
THOSE FEES ARE ALREADY INCREASED

02:32:32.676 --> 02:32:34.478
ON THE DAM OWNERS AND WOOD AND

02:32:34.545 --> 02:32:37.481
WILL BE TO COVER THOSE -- IF.

02:32:37.548 --> 02:32:38.449
AND THEN ONCE THEY TAKE CARE OF

02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:40.951
THOSE ONE TIME ACTIVITIES THEN

02:32:41.018 --> 02:32:42.019
THOSE HIGHER FEES THAT HAVE

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:42.987
ALREADY BEEN INCREASED WILL

02:32:43.053 --> 02:32:44.688
START TO COVER THE SIX NEW

02:32:44.755 --> 02:32:46.357
POSITIONS SO I THINK THE

02:32:46.423 --> 02:32:47.858
PROPOSAL THE FROM THE DEPARTMENT

02:32:47.925 --> 02:32:48.726
IS TO AVOID.

02:32:48.792 --> 02:32:51.362
AND A DIVISIONAL INCREASE FOR

02:32:51.428 --> 02:32:52.897
THESE NEW POSITIONS OVER THE

02:32:52.963 --> 02:32:55.165
NEXT THREE YEARS SO IT'S NOT

02:32:55.232 --> 02:32:56.233
AVOIDING.

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:57.735
THEM INCREASING NOW THEY THEY

02:32:57.801 --> 02:32:59.703
ARE FACING INCREASES NOW IS JUST

02:32:59.770 --> 02:33:01.438
BE KIND OF THE DOUBLE WHAMMY

02:33:01.505 --> 02:33:04.875
ABOVE THAT 55% FOR THREE YEARS.

02:33:04.942 --> 02:33:06.677
SO IN IN OUR AN ANALYSIS IT IS

02:33:06.744 --> 02:33:08.145
YOU KNOW IT IS A LITTLE BIT

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:11.115
INCONSISTENT WITH OUR

02:33:11.181 --> 02:33:12.049
BENEFICIARY PAYS.

02:33:12.116 --> 02:33:12.950
PRACTICE THAT WE USUALLY HAVE

02:33:13.017 --> 02:33:13.784
FOR THE DAM OWNERS BUT GIVEN

02:33:13.851 --> 02:33:15.052
IT'S A RELATIVELY MODERATE

02:33:15.119 --> 02:33:16.253
AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND FOUR

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:17.288
POINT NINE MILLION AND IT IS

02:33:17.354 --> 02:33:19.123
BEEN A LOT OF INCREASED COSTS

02:33:19.189 --> 02:33:20.624
AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

02:33:20.691 --> 02:33:21.458
IN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME

02:33:21.525 --> 02:33:23.027
PERIOD ON THESE OWNERS WE THINK

02:33:23.093 --> 02:33:24.361
IT'S REASONABLE CEREMONY OF

02:33:24.428 --> 02:33:26.730
QUESTION.

02:33:26.797 --> 02:33:28.265
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO

02:33:28.332 --> 02:33:28.566
[inaudible]

02:33:28.632 --> 02:33:31.135
I'M.

02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:32.536
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE

02:33:32.603 --> 02:33:34.538
BALDWIN HILLS.

02:33:34.605 --> 02:33:36.674
FAILURE AND WATCHING THAT ON

02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:37.975
TELEVISION.

02:33:38.042 --> 02:33:39.910
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST REAL TIME

02:33:39.977 --> 02:33:42.580
DISASTERS I THINK ON TV.

02:33:42.646 --> 02:33:45.215
MORE RECENTLY WE PARTICIPATED

02:33:45.282 --> 02:33:46.283
WITH YOUR DIVISION IN THE

02:33:46.350 --> 02:33:47.952
REMOVAL OF THE SAME CALL MANY

02:33:48.018 --> 02:33:49.820
DAM IN THE UPPER CARMEL RIVER

02:33:49.887 --> 02:33:52.590
WHICH WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST DAM

02:33:52.656 --> 02:33:54.258
REOVAL PROJECTS.

02:33:54.325 --> 02:33:55.626
PERHAPS ANYWHERE CERTAINLY IN

02:33:55.693 --> 02:33:58.228
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:33:58.295 --> 02:34:00.798
BUT MY QUESTION -- SIX HUNDRED

02:34:00.864 --> 02:34:02.399
FIFTY DAMS CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED

02:34:02.466 --> 02:34:07.371
AS HIGH OR EXTREMELY HIGH HAZARD --

02:34:07.438 --> 02:34:10.641
WITH THESE NEW POSITIONS OR WITH

02:34:10.708 --> 02:34:12.876
CURRENT PLANNING.

02:34:12.943 --> 02:34:14.778
ARE YOU DOING ANY.

02:34:14.845 --> 02:34:18.549
EVALUATION I'M WITH AMONG THOSE.

02:34:18.616 --> 02:34:19.149
SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DO YOU HAVE

02:34:19.216 --> 02:34:21.819
ANY RANKING AMONG THOSE OF ONES

02:34:21.885 --> 02:34:23.887
THAT POSE A GREATER RISK THAN

02:34:23.954 --> 02:34:25.856
OTHERS IN TERMS OF PROXIMITY TO

02:34:25.923 --> 02:34:27.992
POPULATION.

02:34:28.058 --> 02:34:30.094
CENTERS OR NEW POPULATION

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:33.397
CENTERS OR LIKELIHOOD OF FAILURE

02:34:33.464 --> 02:34:35.599
VERSES.

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:37.568
SIZE MAKE SOME SEISMIC ISSUES

02:34:37.635 --> 02:34:39.837
BUT NOT AN EVALUATION OF LIKELY

02:34:39.903 --> 02:34:42.373
FAILURE -- CORRECT CORRECT -- AS

02:34:42.439 --> 02:34:43.774
WE'VE BEEN DOING OUR SEISMIC

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:45.743
REVALUATION PROGRAM OVER THE

02:34:45.809 --> 02:34:47.811
LAST TEN TWENTY YEARS THAT'S WE

02:34:47.878 --> 02:34:49.480
WE ALWAYS START OFF WITH THE

02:34:49.546 --> 02:34:51.148
SCREENING ASSESSMENT.

02:34:51.215 --> 02:34:53.450
AND WE WOULD LOOK AT THE AGE OF

02:34:53.517 --> 02:34:55.252
THE DAM HOW IT WAS CONSTRUCTED

02:34:55.319 --> 02:34:57.588
BECAUSE THAT PLAYS INTO HOW.

02:34:57.655 --> 02:34:58.922
HOW WELL IT CAN WITHSTAND AN

02:34:58.989 --> 02:35:00.290
EARTHQUAKE AND THEN THE

02:35:00.357 --> 02:35:03.327
PROXIMITY TO THE CLOSEST

02:35:03.394 --> 02:35:04.828
EARTHQUAKE IN WHAT THE?

02:35:04.895 --> 02:35:06.196
SHAKING WOULD BE AT THAT DAM

02:35:06.263 --> 02:35:08.465
SITE AND SO WE HAD A WE HAVE A

02:35:08.532 --> 02:35:10.234
LIST OF FACTORS IN WE WOULD DO

02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:11.468
AN INITIAL SCREENING.

02:35:11.535 --> 02:35:12.836
BUT THAT WAS REALLY SOLELY

02:35:12.903 --> 02:35:14.838
FOCUSED ON SEISMIC IT WASN'T

02:35:14.905 --> 02:35:17.041
LOOKING AT ALL THE OTHER FIFTEEN

02:35:17.107 --> 02:35:20.678
PLUS WAYS A CAN FAIL.

02:35:20.744 --> 02:35:21.779
AND REALLY GETTING IN DEPTH INTO

02:35:21.845 --> 02:35:23.080
IT AND AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

02:35:23.147 --> 02:35:24.048
THIS RISK INFORMED DECISION

02:35:24.114 --> 02:35:25.582
MAKING PROCESS WILL ALLOW US TO

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:26.850
DO IS LOOK AT ALL THOSE AT THE

02:35:26.917 --> 02:35:28.585
WRISTS TOGETHER ALONG WITH.

02:35:28.652 --> 02:35:30.354
THE HIGH POPULATION AREAS AND

02:35:30.421 --> 02:35:31.722
THOSE HIGH RISK MY DAMAGED AREAS

02:35:31.789 --> 02:35:33.323
DOWNSTREAM IF YOU WILL AND THEN

02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:34.892
PRIORITIZE THEM BASED ON THAT%

02:35:34.958 --> 02:35:36.894
THAT'S THE WHOLE GOAL OVER

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:37.394
TRYING TO DO [inaudible]

02:35:37.461 --> 02:35:39.163
IN.

02:35:39.229 --> 02:35:41.065
SHARE WITH ME AGAIN WITH WITH

02:35:41.131 --> 02:35:42.900
THIS ALLOCATION.

02:35:42.966 --> 02:35:45.636
AGAIN WITH A TOTAL OF TWELVE

02:35:45.703 --> 02:35:47.705
HUNDRED FIFTY DAM SOME SIX

02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:50.040
HUNDRED FIFTY RATED HIGH RISK OR

02:35:50.107 --> 02:35:52.543
EXTREMELY HIGH HAZARD.

02:35:52.609 --> 02:35:55.045
HOW OFTEN WILL YOU WILL THERE BE

02:35:55.112 --> 02:35:57.948
AN ANNUAL -- ASSESSMENT OF EACH

02:35:58.015 --> 02:35:59.516
OF THESE STAMPS.

02:35:59.583 --> 02:36:01.285
THE LETTER CURRENTLY YET

02:36:01.351 --> 02:36:02.953
CURRENTLY WE GET THROUGH ABOUT.

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:04.488
ACTUALLY FOR CLOSE TO A DOZEN A

02:36:04.555 --> 02:36:06.457
YEAR YOU KNOW I SAY TEN TO

02:36:06.523 --> 02:36:07.591
TWENTY BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON

02:36:07.658 --> 02:36:09.426
THE OTHER WORK LET IT'S GOING ON

02:36:09.493 --> 02:36:11.061
WITH THE OWNERS THAT HAVE PLANS

02:36:11.128 --> 02:36:13.931
AND SPECS WHO WANT TO GET OUT

02:36:13.997 --> 02:36:15.065
THERE AND DO THEIR REPAIRS.

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:16.300
AND SO LET'S JUST SAY WE DO A

02:36:16.366 --> 02:36:18.535
DOZEN A YEAR WITH THIS THE GOAL

02:36:18.602 --> 02:36:20.871
WOULD BE TO DO THE SCREENING AND

02:36:20.938 --> 02:36:23.340
TO PRIORITIZE SEIZE THE FAILURE

02:36:23.407 --> 02:36:24.308
MODES.

02:36:24.374 --> 02:36:26.009
ABOUT ONE OF ON A BASIS OF ABOUT

02:36:26.076 --> 02:36:27.811
EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS FOR THE

02:36:27.878 --> 02:36:29.346
ENTIRE INVENTORY.

02:36:29.413 --> 02:36:30.514
IN ITS USING A COMPLETELY

02:36:30.581 --> 02:36:32.516
DIFFERENT APPROACH AND IT'S A

02:36:32.583 --> 02:36:33.917
DIFFERENT IT'S IT SHIPPED IN

02:36:33.984 --> 02:36:35.586
CULTURE TO IT'S IT'S RISK

02:36:35.652 --> 02:36:37.521
INFORMED DECISION MAKING AND SO

02:36:37.588 --> 02:36:39.256
YOU'RE THINKING YEARS CHANGING

02:36:39.323 --> 02:36:42.359
HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE THING

AND WHEN IT'S A MULTI

02:36:43.494 --> 02:36:45.295
DISCIPLINARY TEAM THAT'S NEEDED

02:36:45.362 --> 02:36:45.996
TO DO IT.

02:36:46.063 --> 02:36:46.663
IT'S CERTAINLY A HUGE

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:49.199
IMPROVEMENT IN A NEW METHODOLOGY.

02:36:49.266 --> 02:36:50.534
BEGIN GETTING THROUGH THE MALL

02:36:50.601 --> 02:36:54.004
ONCE EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS STILL

02:36:54.071 --> 02:36:54.371
CREATES.

02:36:54.438 --> 02:36:57.007
QUITE A GAP OF POTENTIAL LACK OF

02:36:57.074 --> 02:36:58.442
SURVEILLANCE TO I KNOW IT IT

02:36:58.509 --> 02:37:00.878
ACTUALLY DOESN'T BECAUSE IN THE

02:37:00.944 --> 02:37:02.379

VOLUNTARY DONATIONS TO THIS FUND.

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:52.249
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND THE

THE SCOPE OF WORK OR NEW WORK IT

02:39:57.888 --> 02:40:00.357
IS TO FILL THAT BUDGET GAP.

02:40:00.424 --> 02:40:03.026
OF WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT --

02:40:03.093 --> 02:40:04.528
ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE FINISH THE

02:40:04.594 --> 02:40:06.163
STRATEGIC PLAN THE INITIAL

WE'RE NOW AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE

02:40:30.153 --> 02:40:32.622
TO ACTUALLY BEGIN PUTTING DATA

02:40:32.689 --> 02:40:35.759
SETS ON THIS OPEN DATA PLATFORM.

02:40:35.826 --> 02:40:37.894

SET FEES [inaudible]

02:47:32.642 --> 02:47:36.846
ON THE TECHNOLOGY THE THE TECH

02:47:36.913 --> 02:47:38.815
THE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES ARE

02:47:38.882 --> 02:47:40.383
COMING OR IS IT COULD BE THE THE

02:47:40.450 --> 02:47:42.452
FREIGHT.

02:47:42.519 --> 02:47:44.788
OWNERS THIS WOULD BE THESE ARE

02:47:44.854 --> 02:47:46.055
CERTIFICATION FEES.

02:47:46.122 --> 02:47:47.791
THE WEIGHT SO THE WAY THIS WORKS

02:47:47.857 --> 02:47:49.592
AND THERE BE OF RALPH RELATED

02:47:49.659 --> 02:47:51.261
CONVERSATION FOR THE NEXT A B.

02:47:51.327 --> 02:47:51.761
C. P..

02:47:51.828 --> 02:47:54.197

02:47:59.135 --> 02:48:00.203
APPROVAL.

02:48:00.270 --> 02:48:01.037
THEY WILL.

02:48:01.104 --> 02:48:02.572
IT REQUIRES A FAIR AMOUNT OF

02:48:02.639 --> 02:48:04.574
WORK ON OUR PART TO THE IDEA

02:48:04.641 --> 02:48:06.342
WOULD BE THAT FOLKS THAT ARE

02:48:06.409 --> 02:48:10.447
CERTIFYING THESE TECHNOLOGIES

02:48:10.513 --> 02:48:11.714
WOULD COVER THOSE COSTS.

02:48:11.781 --> 02:48:12.949
OKAY AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE

02:48:13.016 --> 02:48:13.917
PROCESS.

02:48:13.983 --> 02:48:16.119
THERE'S I GOT THIS NEW IDEA I

02:48:16.186 --> 02:48:17.253
GET THIS.

02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:18.955
THIS GIZMO I THINK IT'S GONNA

02:48:19.022 --> 02:48:21.057
REDUCE RIGHT AFTER MARVIN BAH

02:48:21.124 --> 02:48:22.859
BAH BAH BAH BAH AND I COME TO

02:48:22.926 --> 02:48:25.562
YOU GUYS AND LET'S JUST SAY FOR

02:48:25.628 --> 02:48:27.864
PURPOSES OF THIS IT WORKS IT

02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:29.632
REALLY DEBT DOES BUT YOU YOU

02:48:29.699 --> 02:48:31.401
WANNA TESTED IN INNOVATIVE THEY

02:48:31.468 --> 02:48:32.035
DON'T PAY.

02:48:32.101 --> 02:48:33.703
THE CERTIFICATION FEE AT THAT

02:48:33.770 --> 02:48:35.572
TIME RIGHT WELL SO THE WAY THAT

02:48:35.638 --> 02:48:36.473
IT WORKS RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T

02:48:36.539 --> 02:48:38.174
PAY A FEE AT ALL RIGHT NOW SO IN

02:48:38.241 --> 02:48:39.609
THE FREIGHT SECTOR FOR OFFERED

02:48:39.676 --> 02:48:40.443
EQUIPMENT.

02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:41.945
THERE WAS NO UNTIL THAT

02:48:42.011 --> 02:48:44.280
LEGISLATION WAS PASSED IN TWENTY

02:48:44.347 --> 02:48:45.281
EIGHTEEN THERE IS NO AUTHORITY

02:48:45.348 --> 02:48:47.116
FOR US TO CHARGE FEES TO CERTIFY

02:48:47.183 --> 02:48:48.751
FOR OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT.

02:48:48.818 --> 02:48:50.086
SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IN OUR

02:48:50.153 --> 02:48:52.021
REGULATION WE SAY OKAY YOU CAN

02:48:52.088 --> 02:48:54.257
USE THESE INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES

02:48:54.324 --> 02:48:55.558
BUT YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW A OR B.

02:48:55.625 --> 02:48:57.260
HAS TO SAY THAT THEY WORK BEFORE

02:48:57.327 --> 02:48:58.528
YOU CAN USE IT RIGHT THAT KIND

02:48:58.595 --> 02:48:59.662
OF MAKES SENSE.

02:48:59.729 --> 02:49:01.531
AND SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT BUT

02:49:01.598 --> 02:49:02.899
WE'VE BEEN ABSORBING THOSE COSTS

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:04.534
ARE DIVERTING RESOURCES FROM

02:49:04.601 --> 02:49:07.270
OTHER PLACES.

02:49:07.337 --> 02:49:09.873
THAT'S THAT'S HOW THEY WORK.

02:49:09.939 --> 02:49:11.007
HELLO.

02:49:11.074 --> 02:49:12.609
WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH

02:49:12.675 --> 02:49:13.810
THE BUDGET REQUEST TO MIMIC WE

02:49:13.877 --> 02:49:14.878
DID JUST ONE A FLAG ON THE FEE

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:15.845
ISSUE IN THIS SHOWS UP IN YOUR

02:49:15.912 --> 02:49:17.547
NEXT AGENDA ITEM BUT JUST TO

02:49:17.614 --> 02:49:19.516
KIND OF OF ADDRESS IT NOW I MEAN

02:49:19.582 --> 02:49:20.383
IT IT IS.

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:22.218
IT DOES KIND OF REMOVE A ACCOUNT

02:49:22.285 --> 02:49:23.119
RIGHT NOW AND THE AMOUNT OF

02:49:23.186 --> 02:49:24.387
REVENUE THAT CAN BE COLLECTED

02:49:24.454 --> 02:49:25.889
FROM FEES AND AND THAT THAT

02:49:25.955 --> 02:49:29.225
APPLIES TO JUST CERTIFICATION.

02:49:29.292 --> 02:49:30.260
FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT SOURCES

02:49:30.326 --> 02:49:31.661
NOT JUST THE SPECIFIC ONES WERE

02:49:31.728 --> 02:49:32.795
TALKING RIGHT HERE I MEAN IN

02:49:32.862 --> 02:49:34.964
GENERAL WE WE DO THINK THAT IT

02:49:35.031 --> 02:49:37.000
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ASSESS

02:49:37.066 --> 02:49:38.868
FEES ON THE REGULATED ENTITIES.

02:49:38.935 --> 02:49:39.802
TO COVER THE REGULATORY

02:49:39.869 --> 02:49:40.670
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE BEING

02:49:40.737 --> 02:49:42.438
COVERED I WOULD JUST WANNA SORT

02:49:42.505 --> 02:49:43.773
OF FLAG AT THIS IS.

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:45.041
A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES NOT

02:49:45.108 --> 02:49:46.609
QUITE CLEAR KIND OF EXACTLY HOW

02:49:46.676 --> 02:49:48.278
MUCH REVENUE WOULD BE NEEDED TO

02:49:48.344 --> 02:49:49.746
RAISE TO COVER KIND OF ALL THE

02:49:49.812 --> 02:49:51.814
CERTIFICATION COSTS WITHIN A R.

02:49:51.881 --> 02:49:52.982
B. AND SO.

02:49:53.049 --> 02:49:53.650
THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO KIND

02:49:53.716 --> 02:49:55.485
OF ASK YOU WHAT WHAT CARD KNOWS

02:49:55.552 --> 02:49:57.020
ABOUT WHAT THOSE COSTS MIGHT BE

02:49:57.086 --> 02:49:58.021
IN THERE FOR KIND OF WHAT THE

02:49:58.087 --> 02:49:59.389
AMOUNT OF THE FEE MIGHT BE AND

02:49:59.455 --> 02:50:00.523
IF THEY DON'T QUITE KNOW AT THIS

02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:01.291
POINT A WHEN THE LEGISLATURE

02:50:01.357 --> 02:50:02.191
MIGHT.

02:50:02.258 --> 02:50:03.960
MIGHT BE ABLE TO KIND OF EXPECT

02:50:04.027 --> 02:50:04.594
TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION

02:50:04.661 --> 02:50:07.497
AVAILABLE OKAY WHAT TYPE OF FEE

02:50:07.564 --> 02:50:10.233
WILL THIS. ONE WE KNOW ABOUT IT.

02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:11.534
SO -- LE I JUST I WANT TO

02:50:11.601 --> 02:50:12.635
CLARIFY IT SO THE FEES THAT

02:50:12.702 --> 02:50:13.636
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT ARE

02:50:13.703 --> 02:50:16.339
RELATED TO THIS PARTICULAR BCP

02:50:16.406 --> 02:50:17.840
THEY WERE AUTHORIZED -- IN

02:50:17.907 --> 02:50:20.043
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IN

02:50:20.109 --> 02:50:20.543
TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO AS I

02:50:20.610 --> 02:50:21.844
MENTIONED WE'RE IN THE PROCESS

02:50:21.911 --> 02:50:23.346
OF GOING THROUGH AND DOING SORT

02:50:23.413 --> 02:50:26.516
OF A MULTI SOURCE HE REGULATION

02:50:26.583 --> 02:50:27.951
AND THEN FOR THE FREIGHT SECTOR

02:50:28.017 --> 02:50:29.285
WE HAVE SIX DIFFERENT

02:50:29.352 --> 02:50:30.620
REGULATIONS THAT ARE COMING UP

02:50:30.687 --> 02:50:32.855
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

02:50:32.922 --> 02:50:34.357
AND AS WE GO THROUGH THAT

02:50:34.424 --> 02:50:36.459
REGULATORY PROCESS WE'RE GOING

02:50:36.526 --> 02:50:38.328
TO BE -- DEVELOPING A FEE

02:50:38.394 --> 02:50:40.430
STRUCTURE AS WE GO THROUGH THAT

02:50:40.496 --> 02:50:42.565
RULE MAKING SO IT'S AN OPEN

02:50:42.632 --> 02:50:44.300
PUBLIC PROCESS AS PART OF THE

02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:46.102
RULE MAKING IT WE'RE STARTING TO

02:50:46.169 --> 02:50:47.170
DO THE ASSESSMENTS TO LOOK A

02:50:47.236 --> 02:50:48.938
WHAT THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED

02:50:49.005 --> 02:50:49.339
TO DO.

02:50:49.405 --> 02:50:51.307
WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO

02:50:51.374 --> 02:50:53.176
SO IT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL

02:50:53.242 --> 02:50:55.411
BE DEVELOPED AS WE GO ALONG AND

02:50:55.478 --> 02:50:56.879
AS WE GET TO THE NEXT B. C. P.

02:50:56.946 --> 02:51:02.418
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE?

02:51:02.485 --> 02:51:03.786
REMOVAL OF THE CAP.

THIRTY SEVEN ONE POINT.

02:51:07.890 --> 02:51:09.125
THREE TWO SIX FOUR INNOVATIVE

02:51:09.192 --> 02:51:11.661
FREIGHT TECHNOLOGIES.

02:51:11.728 --> 02:51:13.630
EVALUATION APPROVAL CLOSE PUBLIC

02:51:13.696 --> 02:51:15.264

02:51:15.331 --> 02:51:18.034
IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE

02:51:18.101 --> 02:51:20.403
BUDGET REQUESTS MOTION BY CENTER

02:51:20.470 --> 02:51:22.005
STERN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

02:51:22.071 --> 02:51:23.673
I CASKEY BY [inaudible]

JONES [inaudible]

02:51:25.642 --> 02:51:28.044
MCGUIRE.

02:51:28.111 --> 02:51:31.314
MONNING NAY STERN RIGHT THEY

02:51:31.381 --> 02:51:32.915
WILL KEEP THE OUR ROLES OPEN FOR

02:51:32.982 --> 02:51:35.785
THE ABSENT MEMBERS NOW LET'S GO.

02:51:35.852 --> 02:51:36.886
TO THE HEAVY DUTY FACE TO

02:51:36.953 --> 02:51:39.122
GREENHOUSE GAS IMPLEMENTATION

02:51:39.188 --> 02:51:40.890
AND AUDIT PROGRAM.

02:51:40.957 --> 02:51:42.725
OKAY BUT A TRAILER LANGUAGE IN

02:51:42.792 --> 02:51:44.327
THIS P. C. P. WERE REQUESTING

02:51:44.394 --> 02:51:45.962
ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS

02:51:46.029 --> 02:51:46.696
FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL

02:51:46.763 --> 02:51:47.730
FUNDS.

02:51:47.797 --> 02:51:49.565
AND TEN POSITIONS THAT PHASE IN

02:51:49.632 --> 02:51:51.100
OVER THREE YEARS AND THESE

02:51:51.167 --> 02:51:52.702
POSITIONS ARE TO REVIEW AND

02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:54.037
CERTIFIED MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

02:51:54.103 --> 02:51:55.705
ENGINES AND VEHICLES AND

02:51:55.772 --> 02:51:58.408
TRAILERS -- TO THE NEWLY ADOPTED

02:51:58.474 --> 02:52:00.677
CALIFORNIA PHASE TWO GREENHOUSE

02:52:00.743 --> 02:52:02.645
GAS REGULATIONS SO THESE ARE AS

02:52:02.712 --> 02:52:03.946
YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE SECOND

02:52:04.013 --> 02:52:05.181
PHASE OF GREENHOUSE GAS

02:52:05.248 --> 02:52:06.449
EMISSIONS STANDARDS THAT WE

02:52:06.516 --> 02:52:08.351
ADOPTED IN COORDINATION WITH THE

02:52:08.418 --> 02:52:09.385
US EPA.

02:52:09.452 --> 02:52:10.053
THESE ARE GONNA REDUCE

02:52:10.119 --> 02:52:11.421
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM

02:52:11.487 --> 02:52:13.222
HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY ENGINES BY

02:52:13.289 --> 02:52:16.492
ABOUT A THIRD OF BY.

02:52:16.559 --> 02:52:17.093
TWENTY FIFTY SAID THERE'S TWO

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:18.194
MAIN REASONS THAT WE NEED

02:52:18.261 --> 02:52:20.029
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

02:52:20.096 --> 02:52:21.564
IMPLEMENT THIS REGULATION.

02:52:21.631 --> 02:52:22.632
THE ENGINES THAT ARE MEETING THE

02:52:22.699 --> 02:52:24.801
STANDARD ARE A LOT MORE COMPLEX

02:52:24.867 --> 02:52:26.836
THAN ENGINES MEETING THE PHASE

02:52:26.903 --> 02:52:27.670
ONE STANDARD.

02:52:27.737 --> 02:52:29.005
AND THE DATA AND DOCUMENTATION

02:52:29.072 --> 02:52:30.873
REQUIRED IS MUCH GREATER THAN WE

02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:33.009
PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED AND I'M JUST

02:52:33.076 --> 02:52:34.744
GONNA SAY FOLKS WAGON WE'RE

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:35.978
TRYING TO GET A BETTER HANDLE

02:52:36.045 --> 02:52:37.146
THEY WERE REQUIRING MORE

02:52:37.213 --> 02:52:38.281
INFORMATION.

02:52:38.347 --> 02:52:39.982
SO THE WORKLOAD TO PROCESS THE

02:52:40.049 --> 02:52:41.651
CERTIFICATIONS IS GOING TO BE

02:52:41.718 --> 02:52:43.786
MUCH HIGHER -- THESE FACE TO

02:52:43.853 --> 02:52:45.388
REGULATIONS ALSO INCLUDE FOR THE

02:52:45.455 --> 02:52:47.023
FIRST TIME WE HAVE GREENHOUSE

02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:48.424
GAS EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR

02:52:48.491 --> 02:52:49.759
TRAILERS.

02:52:49.826 --> 02:52:50.993
AND SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO

02:52:51.060 --> 02:52:52.261
DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW PROCESS

02:52:52.328 --> 02:52:53.830
WE'VE NEVER CERTIFIED TRAILERS

02:52:53.896 --> 02:52:55.798
BEFORE AND SO WE NEED TO DEVELOP

02:52:55.865 --> 02:52:57.200
AND IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR

02:52:57.266 --> 02:52:58.434
OVER A HUNDRED NEW TRAILER

02:52:58.501 --> 02:53:00.269
CERTIFICATIONS EVERY YEAR.

02:53:00.336 --> 02:53:01.938
WHAT TYPE OF THE MISSIONS COULD

02:53:02.004 --> 02:53:03.940
DISK SUBCOMMITTEE EXPECT OFFER

02:53:04.006 --> 02:53:05.742
THE TRAILERS WELL THIS THAT WHAT

02:53:05.808 --> 02:53:08.311
THIS IS IS BY HAVING A MORE

02:53:08.377 --> 02:53:10.613
EFFICIENT TRAILER YOUR REDUCING

02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:12.081
THE AMOUNT OF FUEL THAT THE

02:53:12.148 --> 02:53:15.885
TRUCK THE TRACTOR NEEDS TO PULL

02:53:15.952 --> 02:53:17.954

02:53:18.020 --> 02:53:19.555
OKAY THANK IS THAT OKAY.

02:53:19.622 --> 02:53:20.890
SO AND ACTUALLY I ASKED THEM TO

02:53:20.957 --> 02:53:21.557
THIS QUESTION -- THEY'RE LOOKING

02:53:21.624 --> 02:53:22.158
AT THINGS LIKE TIRE PRESSURE

02:53:22.225 --> 02:53:23.760
MONITORING SYSTEMS AERODYNAMICS

02:53:23.826 --> 02:53:24.327
AND THINGS LIKE THAT ON THE

02:53:24.393 --> 02:53:26.829
TRAILERS -- SO THE SECOND REASON

02:53:26.896 --> 02:53:28.064
THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ADDITIONAL

02:53:28.131 --> 02:53:30.333
RESOURCES IS I'M FOR THE PHASE

02:53:30.399 --> 02:53:32.969
ONE STANDARDS WE BASICALLY SAID

I'M WE'RE TAKING A MORE ACTIVE

02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:42.211
ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING THE PHASE

02:53:42.278 --> 02:53:44.013
TWO STANDARDS AND SO WE ARE

02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:45.381
GOING TO BE DOING.

02:53:45.448 --> 02:53:47.083
ON THE REVIEW OF THOSE

02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:49.152

THEM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:53:50.119 --> 02:53:50.820

02:53:50.887 --> 02:53:52.922
REGULATION IS IMPLEMENTED

02:53:52.989 --> 02:53:54.190
PROPERLY.

02:53:54.257 --> 02:53:56.058
I'M OLDER DIESEL ENGINES ARE

02:53:56.125 --> 02:53:57.226
RELATIVELY SMALL CONTRIBUTED STE

02:53:57.293 --> 02:53:59.128
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STATE'S

02:53:59.195 --> 02:54:00.763
CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEM PROBLEM.

02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:01.664
IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET

02:54:01.731 --> 02:54:03.132
REDUCTIONS FROM EVERY SOURCE I

02:54:03.199 --> 02:54:04.200
THINK WE'VE TALKED TO THIS

02:54:04.267 --> 02:54:05.735
COMMITTEE BEFORE ABOUT HOW

02:54:05.802 --> 02:54:06.903
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR

TRANSPORTATION ARE INCREASING.

02:54:09.672 --> 02:54:10.239
SO WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE

02:54:10.306 --> 02:54:11.073
CAN.

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:12.909
AND IN ADDITION IMPLEMENTATION

02:54:12.975 --> 02:54:14.243
OF PHASE TWO ENGINES IS ALSO

02:54:14.310 --> 02:54:15.211
GOING TO HELP PRODUCE SMOG

THESE ENGINES.

02:54:18.614 --> 02:54:19.982
NOW WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AN

02:54:20.049 --> 02:54:22.051
IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS VCP IS

02:54:22.118 --> 02:54:23.619
THIS PURPOSE HOSE TRAILER BILL

02:54:23.686 --> 02:54:24.787

ACTIVITIES SO THAT'S CARS AND

02:54:32.028 --> 02:54:33.062

IS CAPPED AT NINE POINT SIX

02:54:34.697 --> 02:54:37.466
MILLION DOLLARS IN.

02:54:37.533 --> 02:54:38.100
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT THE TRAILER

02:54:38.167 --> 02:54:41.637
BILL DOES IS IT REMOVES THE CAP.

02:54:41.704 --> 02:54:43.039
IT ALLOWS FEE ASSESSMENT FOR THE

02:54:43.105 --> 02:54:44.740
CERTIFICATION OF TRAILERS AND

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:46.642

02:54:51.013 --> 02:54:52.415
SO IF THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

02:54:52.481 --> 02:54:53.683
IS APPROVED WE WILL BEGIN THE

02:54:53.749 --> 02:54:55.551

STAKEHOLDER PROCESS.

02:55:05.928 --> 02:55:06.863
AND WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE

02:55:06.929 --> 02:55:08.598
TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES COLLECTED

02:55:08.664 --> 02:55:10.132
TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT U.

02:55:10.199 --> 02:55:12.268
S. EPA'S COLLECTING FOR THEIR

02:55:12.335 --> 02:55:13.536
CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS.

02:55:13.603 --> 02:55:16.606
HIS NINE POINT SIX MILLION OR SO

02:55:16.672 --> 02:55:18.574
WHAT USEPA COLLECTS RIGHTNOW

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:20.009
BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

THEM AND THIS IS FOR ALL OF

02:55:21.978 --> 02:55:23.379
THEIR CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR

ON ROAD OFF ROAD LOCOMOTIVES

02:55:25.781 --> 02:55:27.416
EVERYTHING THAT THEY CERTIFY.

02:55:27.483 --> 02:55:29.118
IS ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:55:29.185 --> 02:55:30.186
A YEAR.

02:55:30.253 --> 02:55:32.622
WHAT'S THE SIZE THAT FEE COULD

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:34.357
BE.

02:55:34.423 --> 02:55:35.758
YOU KNOW SO IT IT REALLY DEPENDS

02:55:35.825 --> 02:55:37.026
COVERS THE COST NATURALLY YEAH I

02:55:37.093 --> 02:55:38.527
KNOW IT'S IN IT'S INTENDED TO

02:55:38.594 --> 02:55:39.695
COVER THE COSTS AND I I THINK

02:55:39.762 --> 02:55:40.162
THAT.

02:55:40.229 --> 02:55:41.464
YOU THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS

02:55:41.530 --> 02:55:42.565
THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE

02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:44.734
BEST WAY TO ASSESS THAT FEE AND

02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:45.935
HOW DO YOU.

02:55:46.002 --> 02:55:47.837
HOW DO YOU ASSIGN THAT FEATURE

02:55:47.904 --> 02:55:49.505
THE DIFFERENT FOLKS THAT ARE

02:55:49.572 --> 02:55:51.407
APPLYING FOR CERTIFICATION AND

02:55:51.474 --> 02:55:53.209
SOME OF THE -- SOME OF THE

02:55:53.276 --> 02:55:54.977
SOURCES ARE GONNA BE QUITE SMALL

02:55:55.044 --> 02:55:56.479
SO PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING.

02:55:56.545 --> 02:55:57.747
BY PEOPLE WHO ARE CERTIFYING

02:55:57.813 --> 02:55:59.382
LIKE AFTERMARKET PARTS THEY

02:55:59.448 --> 02:56:01.117
MIGHT BE MKING ONLY A FEW

02:56:01.183 --> 02:56:03.119
HUNDRED OF THEM -- FOLKS THAT

02:56:03.185 --> 02:56:05.121
ARE -- CERTIFYING ENGINES FOR

02:56:05.187 --> 02:56:06.856
CARS ARE AN ENGINE FAMILY FOR

02:56:06.923 --> 02:56:08.291
CARS MIGHT BE SELLING MILLIONS

02:56:08.357 --> 02:56:10.226
OF THEM AND SO I THINK ONE OF

02:56:10.293 --> 02:56:11.460
THE CHALLENGES AS WE GO THROUGH

02:56:11.527 --> 02:56:12.695
THAT PUBLIC RULE MAKING PROCESS

02:56:12.762 --> 02:56:13.829
IS TO SET UP.

02:56:13.896 --> 02:56:16.432
A STRUCTURE FOR THE RULE THAT

02:56:16.499 --> 02:56:18.534
MAKES SENSE AND WORKS SO THAT'S

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:19.669
I THINK PART OF THE PUBLIC

02:56:19.735 --> 02:56:22.271
PROCESS -- IF THE TRAILER BILL

02:56:22.338 --> 02:56:25.441
LANGUAGE IS APPROVED ALLEY ARE

02:56:25.508 --> 02:56:27.343
YOU SATISFIED WITH THAT.

02:56:27.410 --> 02:56:27.944

02:56:28.010 --> 02:56:29.011
STILL YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE

02:56:29.078 --> 02:56:30.079

02:56:30.146 --> 02:56:30.846
BIT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND KIND

02:56:30.913 --> 02:56:32.915
OF EGGMAN THE EXACT COSTS BUT

02:56:32.982 --> 02:56:33.983

BROILERS AN EGG LAYERS.

03:07:11.019 --> 03:07:13.488
RIGHT NOW IT'S PRIMARILY AND

03:07:13.555 --> 03:07:15.223

RATCHETS IN AREAS LIKE THAT.

03:07:18.961 --> 03:07:20.896
BUT IT HAS MOVED INTO A SMALL

03:07:20.963 --> 03:07:22.998
LAYING FLOCKS IMPOLITE RANCHES

03:07:23.065 --> 03:07:24.199
DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

03:07:24.266 --> 03:07:26.702
HOW WE KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED

03:07:26.768 --> 03:07:27.936
WE HAVE HAD?

03:07:28.003 --> 03:07:28.904
FIND AFTER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:07:28.971 --> 03:07:31.039

SPREAD TO THE BROILER INDUSTRY.

03:07:33.008 --> 03:07:34.242

POINT TWO ONE GOING IN TWENTY

03:07:37.746 --> 03:07:39.214
THREE POSITIONS.

03:07:39.281 --> 03:07:41.049
SO THAT WE CAN BETTER -- PUT

03:07:41.116 --> 03:07:43.719
TOGETHER A TEAM TO WORK ON

03:07:43.785 --> 03:07:45.487
PREVENTION OF FUTURE DISEASE

03:07:45.554 --> 03:07:47.823
OUTBREAKS AND A MORE RAPID IN

03:07:47.889 --> 03:07:49.424
ROBUST RESPONSE WHEN THESE

03:07:49.491 --> 03:07:51.126
DISEASE OUTBREAKS TO HAPPEN SO

03:07:51.193 --> 03:07:52.227
THAT WE CAN CONTAIN THEM FAR

03:07:52.294 --> 03:07:53.395
QUICKER.

03:07:53.462 --> 03:07:55.130
AND ALSO CONTAINED WITHIN THIS

03:07:55.197 --> 03:07:57.633
PROPOSAL IS SOME STAFF WHO DO

03:07:57.699 --> 03:07:59.101
SIMILAR FUNCTIONS BUT THEN THEY

03:07:59.167 --> 03:08:00.936
WILL BE FOCUSED ON ANIMAL CARE

03:08:01.003 --> 03:08:02.504
ISSUES DURING CATASTROPHIC

03:08:02.571 --> 03:08:03.772
EMERGENCY EVENTS.

03:08:03.839 --> 03:08:05.273
SUCH AS WHAT WE EXPERIENCED

03:08:05.340 --> 03:08:06.742
DURING THE RECENT CAMPFIRE --

03:08:06.808 --> 03:08:09.277
BUT IN TWO YEARS AGO AS WELL IN

03:08:09.344 --> 03:08:10.612
CINEMA COUNTY CENTER MCGUIRE.

03:08:10.679 --> 03:08:12.014
WITH ANIMAL CARE ISSUES THAT

03:08:12.080 --> 03:08:13.248
COME UP WITH PEOPLE HAVING TO

03:08:13.315 --> 03:08:14.616
EVACUATE MOVE THOSE ANIMALS AND

03:08:14.683 --> 03:08:17.185
THEN BEING DISPLACED ON A LONG

03:08:17.252 --> 03:08:17.986
TERM BASIS.

03:08:18.053 --> 03:08:19.321
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE PUT

03:08:19.388 --> 03:08:21.423
THAT IN THIS PROPOSAL IS SOME OF

03:08:21.490 --> 03:08:22.524
THE SAME SKILL SETS ARE

03:08:22.591 --> 03:08:24.426
FUNCTIONAL TO BOTH TYPES OF

03:08:24.493 --> 03:08:25.527
OPERATIONS.

03:08:25.594 --> 03:08:26.928
AND SO WE FELT IT WAS A GOOD USE

03:08:26.995 --> 03:08:28.630
OF RESOURCES TO PUT THESE TEAMS

03:08:28.697 --> 03:08:30.399
TOGETHER TRAIN THEM UP IN

03:08:30.465 --> 03:08:32.234
PREVENTION TRAINING WORKING WITH

03:08:32.300 --> 03:08:33.535
LOCALS ON PLANTS.

03:08:33.602 --> 03:08:35.604
AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND

03:08:35.671 --> 03:08:37.839
BUT TO SET THE BASIC CORE

03:08:37.906 --> 03:08:39.174
UNDERSTAND ANIMAL CARE ISSUES.

03:08:39.241 --> 03:08:40.275
IN AND THAT WAY WE HAVE THE

03:08:40.342 --> 03:08:41.777
FLEXIBILITY TO DEPLOY THESE

03:08:41.843 --> 03:08:44.312
PEOPLE DURING DISEASE OUTBREAKS

03:08:44.379 --> 03:08:45.647
AS WELL AS EMERGENCY OUTBREAKS.

03:08:45.714 --> 03:08:47.282
QUITE A FEW OF THE MEMBERS OF

03:08:47.349 --> 03:08:48.917
THE TEAMS ARE INSPECTORS SO I

03:08:48.984 --> 03:08:50.252
SEE LET'S JUST PICK THE

03:08:50.318 --> 03:08:52.654
EUTHANASIA TEAM THE YOU'VE GOT.

03:08:52.721 --> 03:08:55.524
A SENIOR LIVESTOCK INSPECTOR IN

03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:56.458
FOR LIVESTOCK INSPECTORS AND

03:08:56.525 --> 03:08:58.160
THEN ONE VETERINARIAN AYE I

03:08:58.226 --> 03:08:58.627
THINK I GET WITH THE

03:08:58.694 --> 03:09:00.429
VETERINARIAN DOES SO YOU'VE GOT

03:09:00.495 --> 03:09:01.897
THESE FIVE ON THE TEAM.

03:09:01.963 --> 03:09:05.333
BUT THE OTHER THE FIELD

03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:08.036
REIMBURSEMENT [inaudible]

03:09:08.103 --> 03:09:09.938
SPECIALIST HAS. ONE OF THE

03:09:10.005 --> 03:09:12.674
QUARANTINE ENFORCEMENT HAS.

03:09:12.741 --> 03:09:14.776
OF INSPECTORS THE DISEASE

03:09:14.843 --> 03:09:16.611
DETECTION HAS INSPECTORS THOSE

03:09:16.678 --> 03:09:17.979
INSPECTORS.

03:09:18.046 --> 03:09:20.382
THEY JUST STAY ON THE EUTHANASIA

03:09:20.449 --> 03:09:22.184
CHAMBER TODAY ARE THEY ABLE OF A

03:09:22.250 --> 03:09:24.219
ORTABLE TO THESE OTHER

03:09:24.286 --> 03:09:27.322
QUARANTINE INVESTIGATIONS.

03:09:27.389 --> 03:09:28.657
YOU KNOW THESE OTHER.

03:09:28.724 --> 03:09:30.792
FUNCTIONS I'M ALL I CAN ADDRESS

03:09:30.859 --> 03:09:32.327
I AM SO I MATCH I'M GLAD YOU

03:09:32.394 --> 03:09:33.395
ASKED THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT

03:09:33.462 --> 03:09:34.830
KIND OF GETS TO IT ONE OF THE

03:09:34.896 --> 03:09:37.165
KEY PRINCIPLES ON HOW WE

03:09:37.232 --> 03:09:37.632
PREPARED TO RESPOND.

03:09:37.699 --> 03:09:39.000
WE USE THE MODEL THAT A LOT OF

03:09:39.067 --> 03:09:40.836
THAT -- YES USES A LOT OF FIRE

03:09:40.902 --> 03:09:42.504
FIRE POLICE AND WE TRYING TO BE

03:09:42.571 --> 03:09:43.438
MORE OF AN ALL HAZARDS

03:09:43.505 --> 03:09:45.640
ORGANIZATION BUT WITHIN THAT WE

03:09:45.707 --> 03:09:47.609
HAVE TO IN BED SPECIALTIES.

03:09:47.676 --> 03:09:49.411
SO WHAT WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WE

03:09:49.478 --> 03:09:51.146
HAVE A GAP WHERE WE REALLY NEED

03:09:51.213 --> 03:09:52.914
TO AND AND ESPECIALLY WHERE

03:09:52.981 --> 03:09:54.382
THERE'S NO WEATHER WILL OTHER

03:09:54.449 --> 03:09:55.717
AGENTS HERE OTHER RESOURCE THAT

03:09:55.784 --> 03:09:57.119
HAS THAT SPECIALTY.

03:09:57.185 --> 03:09:58.854
SO WE WOULD EXPECT THOSE STAFF

03:09:58.920 --> 03:09:59.821
LIKE THE ONES THAT YOU JUST

03:09:59.888 --> 03:10:02.157
DESCRIBED TO BE OUR STATE

03:10:02.224 --> 03:10:04.326
EXPERTS IN THOSE AREAS AND PART

03:10:04.392 --> 03:10:05.961
OF THEIR JOB WAS TO MAKE SURE

03:10:06.027 --> 03:10:07.629
THAT ALL OF OUR STAFF HAS A

03:10:07.696 --> 03:10:09.297
LEVEL PURSE PROFICIENCY IN THOSE

03:10:09.364 --> 03:10:10.298
AREAS.

03:10:10.365 --> 03:10:12.033
SO THAT WE CAN MIX AND MATCH AND

03:10:12.100 --> 03:10:14.169
MOVE AT PEOPLE TO WHERE THEY'RE

03:10:14.236 --> 03:10:15.737
THEY'RE NEEDED BECAUSE YOU

03:10:15.804 --> 03:10:17.005
REALLY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD

03:10:17.072 --> 03:10:19.274
THERE IS NO RESPONSE IS EXACTLY

03:10:19.341 --> 03:10:21.243
THE SAME FROM LOCATION EQUATION

03:10:21.309 --> 03:10:22.744
DISEASE THE DISEASE DISASTER TO

03:10:22.811 --> 03:10:25.046
DISASTER -- BUT THOSE WERE JUST

03:10:25.113 --> 03:10:27.082
CLEAR GAPS THAT WE BECAME

03:10:27.149 --> 03:10:28.784
UNFORTUNATELY A PAINFULLY AWARE

03:10:28.850 --> 03:10:31.553
OF OVER THE PAST YEAR SO YOU

03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:33.688
ANTICIPATE DOCTOR THAT THE THAT

03:10:33.755 --> 03:10:35.223
THAT INSPECTOR.

03:10:35.290 --> 03:10:36.625
HE GOT A VERY LEARNED.

03:10:36.691 --> 03:10:38.660
NEWCASTLE DISEASE OUTBREAKS THEY

03:10:38.727 --> 03:10:40.262
WOULD BE THAT THE INSPECTOR

03:10:40.328 --> 03:10:42.497
WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY I NEED TO

03:10:42.564 --> 03:10:46.468
GET THE QUARANTINE TEAM MANNER I

03:10:46.535 --> 03:10:46.968
NEED.

03:10:47.035 --> 03:10:48.303
TO TAKE A TO TAKE THESE ACTIONS

03:10:48.370 --> 03:10:50.705
OR WE NEED TO EUTHANIZE THIS

03:10:50.772 --> 03:10:52.507
THIS IS THIS IS WHATEVER THE

03:10:52.574 --> 03:10:54.176
STATUS IS RIGHT RIGHT SO THEY

03:10:54.242 --> 03:10:56.011
WOULD PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP

03:10:56.077 --> 03:10:56.945
THAT WE WOULD NEED.

03:10:57.012 --> 03:10:58.513
TO WHEN AS WE BRING OTHER PEOPLE

03:10:58.580 --> 03:11:00.215
ON BOARD SO FOR EXAMPLE ON OUR

03:11:00.282 --> 03:11:02.984
CURRENT OUTBREAK WE USE A LOT OF

03:11:03.051 --> 03:11:05.287
TEMPORARY HIRES OR OR OF PEOPLE

03:11:05.353 --> 03:11:06.855
FROM OTHER AGENCIES THAT DON'T

03:11:06.922 --> 03:11:08.757
HAVE THOSE EXPERTISE SO WE WOULD

03:11:08.824 --> 03:11:09.991
ACTUALLY.

03:11:10.058 --> 03:11:11.459
PROBABLY THAT TEAM WOULDN'T

03:11:11.526 --> 03:11:12.994
FUNCTION EXACTLY AS A TEAM IS

03:11:13.061 --> 03:11:14.896
DESCRIBED BUT RATHER THEY'D BE

03:11:14.963 --> 03:11:16.765
BROKEN UP IN BE PROVIDE

03:11:16.832 --> 03:11:18.500
LEADERSHIP ROLES -- AS WE BRING

03:11:18.567 --> 03:11:20.335
NEW PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE SURE I

03:11:20.402 --> 03:11:20.802
MEAN YOU YOU MENTIONED

03:11:20.869 --> 03:11:21.870
EUTHANASIA THAT'S PROBABLY THE

03:11:21.937 --> 03:11:23.605
MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DO

03:11:23.672 --> 03:11:24.105
CORRECTLY.

03:11:24.172 --> 03:11:31.780
AND HAS THE WEB BASED TRACKER AT

03:11:31.847 --> 03:11:32.514
THAT I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

03:11:32.581 --> 03:11:33.648
END.

03:11:33.715 --> 03:11:35.784
DE AND TRACKING BUT IS THAT THE

03:11:35.851 --> 03:11:36.985
YOU ANTICIPATE THAT SOMETIME

03:11:37.052 --> 03:11:37.853
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO KNOW.

03:11:37.919 --> 03:11:40.388
I'M IN SAN BERNADINO AND THEN IT

03:11:40.455 --> 03:11:41.957
GOES UP WHAT'S MORE THE SAN

03:11:42.023 --> 03:11:43.692
BERNADINO KNOWS RIGHT SAN

03:11:43.758 --> 03:11:44.526
JOAQUIN.

03:11:44.593 --> 03:11:45.026
AS IT GOES THROUGH THESE

03:11:45.093 --> 03:11:47.295
COUNTIES IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE.

03:11:47.362 --> 03:11:48.663
THAT THAT DATA THAT INFORMATION

03:11:48.730 --> 03:11:51.967
SO THE THE CHICKEN.

03:11:52.033 --> 03:11:54.102
FARMER AS A FARMER OR RANCHER

03:11:54.169 --> 03:11:55.203
WHATEVER THEY ARE [inaudible]

03:11:55.270 --> 03:11:57.505
SO.

03:11:57.572 --> 03:11:58.807
ADLER GET TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

03:11:58.874 --> 03:12:00.775
THESE OUTBREAKS THERE ARE --

03:12:00.842 --> 03:12:03.111
VERY DATA INTENSIVE AND DATA

03:12:03.178 --> 03:12:04.880
DRIVEN JUST LIKE WHEN OUR HUMAN

03:12:04.946 --> 03:12:06.381
COUNTERPARTS ARE DEALING WITH

03:12:06.448 --> 03:12:07.916
YOU KNOW HUMAN OUTBREAKS OF

03:12:07.983 --> 03:12:10.285
VARIOUS DISEASES SO -- WE WE DO

03:12:10.352 --> 03:12:13.388
USE A FAIRLY ROBUST DATABASE

03:12:13.455 --> 03:12:15.624
THAT TO TRACK -- YOU KNOW

03:12:15.690 --> 03:12:16.892
DIFFERENT INFORMATION WE USE

03:12:16.958 --> 03:12:18.460
THAT TO MAKE COUNTERMEASURE

03:12:18.526 --> 03:12:21.329
DECISIONS -- WE WE DO A LOT OF

03:12:21.396 --> 03:12:23.231
SURVEILLANCE SO WHICH IF IF

03:12:23.298 --> 03:12:24.499
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR

03:12:24.566 --> 03:12:26.668
AS FAR AS TRACKING THE STATUS OF

03:12:26.735 --> 03:12:28.837
DISEASE -- SO THERE'S A LOT OF

03:12:28.904 --> 03:12:29.971
DIAGNOSTICS AND TESTING

03:12:30.038 --> 03:12:30.972
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE

03:12:31.039 --> 03:12:33.675
STAFF STAFF ACTUALLY INVENTED --

03:12:33.742 --> 03:12:35.710
THROUGHOUT THE STATE MOST OF OUR

03:12:35.777 --> 03:12:38.046
STAFF OUR FIELD STAFF BECAUSE

03:12:38.113 --> 03:12:39.814
THIS EXPERTISE DOESN'T EXIST AT

03:12:39.881 --> 03:12:41.182
THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU KNOW FOR THE

03:12:41.249 --> 03:12:42.751
MOST PART SO THEY'RE EMBEDDED

03:12:42.817 --> 03:12:44.319
THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENSURE.

03:12:44.386 --> 03:12:45.754
WE DON'T HAVE AND IT'S NOT JUST

03:12:45.820 --> 03:12:47.088
THIS ONE DISEASE OR SEVERAL

03:12:47.155 --> 03:12:48.790
DISEASES TO ENSURE THAT WE

03:12:48.857 --> 03:12:49.424
HAVEN'T GOTTEN DISEASE

03:12:49.491 --> 03:12:51.026
INCURSIONS.

03:12:51.092 --> 03:12:54.529
AND FINALLY ON THE I'M FROM TAKE

03:12:54.596 --> 03:12:55.931
IN THE BACKYARD.

03:12:55.997 --> 03:12:57.299
OKAY ALL WHO HAVE THREE OR FOUR

03:12:57.365 --> 03:12:58.300
CHICKENS OR TWO I GUESS WHATEVER

03:12:58.366 --> 03:12:59.901
IT IS IS THE IS THIS OUT OF

03:12:59.968 --> 03:13:00.635
REACH.

03:13:00.702 --> 03:13:02.103
PER CENTER THAT'S GONNA GO IN

03:13:02.170 --> 03:13:03.571
HOW WHAT A SECOND LOOK LIKE WHAT

03:13:03.638 --> 03:13:05.106
DO YOU ENVISION THAT THAT IT

03:13:05.173 --> 03:13:06.775
LOOKING LIKE RIGHT ANOTHER GOOD

03:13:06.841 --> 03:13:07.575
QUESTION AND THEN THE

03:13:07.642 --> 03:13:09.344
DEMOGRAPHICS FOR PEOPLE THAT

03:13:09.411 --> 03:13:10.045
REYES WHAT.

03:13:10.111 --> 03:13:11.313
WERE ONCE CONSIDERED FARM

03:13:11.379 --> 03:13:12.847
ANIMALS IS CERTAINLY SHIFTING

03:13:12.914 --> 03:13:14.316
WHICH IS KIND OF A GOOD THING I

03:13:14.382 --> 03:13:17.686
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE A

03:13:17.752 --> 03:13:18.586
EXISTING.

03:13:18.653 --> 03:13:19.721
BUT SO REACHING THEM IS VERY

03:13:19.788 --> 03:13:22.324
VERY IMPORTANT AND WE USE A LOT

03:13:22.390 --> 03:13:23.358
OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND KIND

03:13:23.425 --> 03:13:25.026
OF BECAUSE EVEN YOU CAN SELL YOU

03:13:25.093 --> 03:13:26.695
CAN TELL THE RESOURCES REQUEST

03:13:26.761 --> 03:13:28.496
HERE IS PROBABLY NOT ADEQUATE TO

03:13:28.563 --> 03:13:29.764
REACH EVERY.

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:31.333
POULTRY OWNER IN THE STATE SO

03:13:31.399 --> 03:13:32.867
WHAT WE WE USE A SYSTEM OF

03:13:32.934 --> 03:13:35.603
LEVERAGING OTHER RESOURCES SO

03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:37.339
FEED STORES ARE ONE GREAT

03:13:37.405 --> 03:13:40.375
EXAMPLE OF OF PLACES WE TRY AND

03:13:40.442 --> 03:13:41.810
LEVERAGE THE MESSAGE.

03:13:41.876 --> 03:13:43.545
OF THAT PRIVATE VETERINARIANS

03:13:43.611 --> 03:13:45.480
ARE REALLY OUR EYES AND EARS SO

03:13:45.547 --> 03:13:46.715
WE DO A LOT OF INTEGRATION WITH

03:13:46.781 --> 03:13:49.284
THEM COOPERATIVE EXTENSION.

03:13:49.351 --> 03:13:51.386
OF DIFFERENT BIRD CLUBS THAT

03:13:51.453 --> 03:13:53.521
TYPE OF THING.

03:13:53.588 --> 03:13:55.290
ALL TO QUESTION.

03:13:55.357 --> 03:13:57.258
DO I HAVE A TRANSYLVANIAN A

03:13:57.325 --> 03:14:00.395
CONNECTS AND POST OP AT SO IT'S

03:14:00.462 --> 03:14:01.696
GOOD STUFF ACCORDING TO BE

03:14:01.763 --> 03:14:02.397
VISITING.

03:14:02.464 --> 03:14:08.436
UP BUT HATE AT IT'S TRUE -- A

03:14:08.503 --> 03:14:09.237
FEW QUESTIONS ON ISSUES A

03:14:09.304 --> 03:14:10.205
DISASTER WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE

03:14:10.271 --> 03:14:11.773
TO FOCUS IN ON SO -- THANK YOU

03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:12.374
FOR RESPONDING BECAUSE I THINK

03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:14.743
THIS IS.

03:14:14.809 --> 03:14:16.111
PRIOR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE

03:14:16.177 --> 03:14:17.545
NEVER THOUGHT.

03:14:17.612 --> 03:14:19.247
HOW MANY HAD A LIVESTOCK

03:14:19.314 --> 03:14:21.016
ACTUALLY COMING OUT DURING A

03:14:21.082 --> 03:14:22.250
THESE WILDFIRE VETS WERE TALKING

03:14:22.317 --> 03:14:23.718
THOUSANDS?

03:14:23.785 --> 03:14:26.788
OF WHETHER THEIR HORSES BACK YOU

03:14:26.855 --> 03:14:29.858
IN CATTLE SHEEP EXEDRA -- AND IN

03:14:29.924 --> 03:14:30.959
MANY THESE RURAL COUNTIES YOU TO

03:14:31.026 --> 03:14:32.560
BE PROPPED UP.

03:14:32.627 --> 03:14:34.295
I AND HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS

03:14:34.362 --> 03:14:35.964
ABLE TO BE ON SITE.

03:14:36.031 --> 03:14:37.966
AND WORK WITH LOCALS IS THAT HOW

03:14:38.033 --> 03:14:40.101
YOU IN TENNESSEE DUE. TO MOVE

03:14:40.168 --> 03:14:41.302
ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF

03:14:41.369 --> 03:14:42.504
DISASTER OR DO YOU.

03:14:42.570 --> 03:14:45.907
BRING. FOR THE TEAM MEMBERS AND

03:14:45.974 --> 03:14:47.342
TO BE ABLE TO BE THERE AND STAFF

03:14:47.409 --> 03:14:48.243
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THE YEAH

03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:50.745
THE CORE MODEL IS IS TO HAVE THE

03:14:50.812 --> 03:14:52.313
APPARATUS IN PLACE SO THAT WE

03:14:52.380 --> 03:14:54.516
HAVE THE CAPABILITY FOR TRAINING.

03:14:54.582 --> 03:14:56.718
BUT ALSO WHEN WE'RE NOT IN IN A

03:14:56.785 --> 03:14:57.952
CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT WE'RE

03:14:58.019 --> 03:14:59.287
WORKING WITH LOCALS PERFORMING

03:14:59.354 --> 03:15:00.688
YEAH REACH DUTIES TO FORM THE

03:15:00.755 --> 03:15:02.357
RELATIONSHIPS AND HELP THEM TO

03:15:02.424 --> 03:15:03.525
DEVELOP THEIR PLANS.

03:15:03.591 --> 03:15:05.427
UPDATE THEIR PLANS MAKE SURE

03:15:05.493 --> 03:15:07.362
THEY HAVE UPDATED RESOURCE LIST

03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:08.830
SO THAT EVERYTHING'S READY TO GO

03:15:08.897 --> 03:15:10.031
IN IN TRAINING IS A KEY

03:15:10.098 --> 03:15:11.466
COMPONENT SO THE LOCAL SINCE ARE

03:15:11.533 --> 03:15:12.834
ALREADY THERE CAN REACT VERY

03:15:12.901 --> 03:15:13.902
QUICKLY.

03:15:13.968 --> 03:15:15.403
AND THEN THE IDEA IS IS OUR

03:15:15.470 --> 03:15:17.405
PEOPLE CAN COME IN AND SIMILARLY

03:15:17.472 --> 03:15:19.307
TO WHAT DOCTOR JONES DESCRIBED

03:15:19.374 --> 03:15:20.642
IN AN ANIMAL DISEASE OF BAD

03:15:20.708 --> 03:15:22.010
WHERE YOU HAVE KEY PEOPLE WHO

03:15:22.077 --> 03:15:23.645
ARE TRAINED UP WITH THE SKILL

03:15:23.711 --> 03:15:24.245
SETS.

03:15:24.312 --> 03:15:25.513
THEN THEY CAN QUICKLY ASSUME

03:15:25.580 --> 03:15:27.382
LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND TRAIN

03:15:27.449 --> 03:15:29.651
LOCALS ARE VOLUNTEERS OR OTHER

03:15:29.717 --> 03:15:30.718
PEOPLE FROM SAY OUR DEPARTMENT

03:15:30.785 --> 03:15:32.520
OR OTHER DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE

03:15:32.587 --> 03:15:34.189
READY TO GO BUT THEY NEED THAT

03:15:34.255 --> 03:15:36.024
SPECIALIZED TRAINING TO TELL

03:15:36.091 --> 03:15:36.825
THEM AND DIRECT THEM ON WHAT TO

03:15:36.891 --> 03:15:38.560
DO SO IT'S LEVERAGING ALL OF

03:15:38.626 --> 03:15:41.696
THOSE DIFFERENT RESOURCES.

03:15:41.763 --> 03:15:44.032
WITH THE CORE TEAM.

03:15:44.099 --> 03:15:45.500
THEY ADD TO THEIR AB IN ANOTHER

03:15:45.567 --> 03:15:47.235
A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS

03:15:47.302 --> 03:15:48.369
AND THE DISASTERS THAT ACTOR

03:15:48.436 --> 03:15:49.537
USES SIZE I AGREE THE SAME SKILL

03:15:49.604 --> 03:15:50.305
SETS IS.

03:15:50.371 --> 03:15:52.173
OF FOR DISASTERS THERE'S A A

03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:53.775
REALLY WONDERFUL NETWORK OF

03:15:53.842 --> 03:15:55.210
VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS WITH

03:15:55.276 --> 03:15:57.545
VERY HIGH LEVELS OF SKILL.

03:15:57.612 --> 03:15:59.614
BUT A LOT OF THE TIMES THE

03:15:59.681 --> 03:16:01.116
PROBLEM IS THE GAP IS ACTUALLY

03:16:01.182 --> 03:16:03.151
COORDINATING THEM WITH THE LOCAL

03:16:03.218 --> 03:16:04.219
FIRST RESPONDERS WHEN

03:16:04.285 --> 03:16:05.820
EVERYBODY'S PRESSED YOU KNOW TO

03:16:05.887 --> 03:16:07.922
SAVE LIVES SO WHAT WE WOULD

03:16:07.989 --> 03:16:09.124
ANTICIPATED ARE.

03:16:09.190 --> 03:16:11.092
THOSE FEW THAT WE HAVE A FEW

03:16:11.159 --> 03:16:13.294
LEADERS WITHIN THAT PROGRAM THAT

03:16:13.361 --> 03:16:15.363
THEIR NUMBER ONE JOB WOULD BE TO

03:16:15.430 --> 03:16:17.265
PULL TOGETHER THESE -- DIFFERENT

03:16:17.332 --> 03:16:19.300
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE GREAT

03:16:19.367 --> 03:16:20.535
RESOURCES THAT COULD BE APPLIED

03:16:20.602 --> 03:16:22.103
DURING A DISASTER SO THEY WOULD

03:16:22.170 --> 03:16:24.105
MAINTAIN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AS

03:16:24.172 --> 03:16:25.573
RESOURCE WE HAVE LESS MAYBE WORK

03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:27.041
ON MUTUAL AID WORK VERY CLOSELY

03:16:27.108 --> 03:16:28.643
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF

03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:29.978
EMERGENCY SERVICES.

03:16:30.044 --> 03:16:32.113
AND THEN DURING A DISASTER THEY

03:16:32.180 --> 03:16:34.015
WOULD GO INTO THOSE COORDINATION

03:16:34.082 --> 03:16:35.683
ROLES THAT YOU KIND OF REFERRED

03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:36.818
TO AND THEY WOULD TAP IN TO BOTH

03:16:36.885 --> 03:16:38.753
OUR DEPARTMENT FOR OUR RESOURCES

03:16:38.820 --> 03:16:40.355
AS WELL AS ALL OF THESE NON

03:16:40.421 --> 03:16:41.990
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND

03:16:42.056 --> 03:16:43.391
OTHERS BUT IN THOSE NON

03:16:43.458 --> 03:16:44.826
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

03:16:44.893 --> 03:16:45.660
JUST BEEN GUIDES.

03:16:45.727 --> 03:16:46.895
AND RIGHT AT THE NAY -- YEAH BUT

03:16:46.961 --> 03:16:49.130
THERE IS A GAP OF THREE TO FIVE

03:16:49.197 --> 03:16:51.099
DAYS -- WHERE IS COMPLETE CHAOS

03:16:51.166 --> 03:16:53.101
RIGHT UP FOLKS LEAVE AND THEN

03:16:53.168 --> 03:16:54.135
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

03:16:54.202 --> 03:16:55.403
TO GET BACK TO BE ABLE TO FEED I

03:16:55.470 --> 03:16:56.171

A VARIETY OF COMPLICATIONS.

03:16:59.440 --> 03:17:01.976
AND WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT

03:17:02.043 --> 03:17:03.344
ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO

DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVES.

03:24:48.376 --> 03:24:49.877
INCLUDING THE USE OF BIOLOGICAL

03:24:49.944 --> 03:24:52.613
CONTROLS AND OTHER INTEGRATED

03:24:52.680 --> 03:24:53.914
PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

03:24:53.981 --> 03:24:55.583
THE P. R. REQUEST TWO POINT ONE

03:24:55.650 --> 03:24:57.184
MILLION GENERAL FUND ONE TIME

03:24:57.251 --> 03:24:58.352
MANY TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR

03:24:58.419 --> 03:25:00.121
PROJECTS THAT DEVELOP AND

03:25:00.187 --> 03:25:01.555
IMPLEMENT INTEGRATED PEST

03:25:01.622 --> 03:25:03.124
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:05.026
THAT REDUCE PESTICIDE RISK TO

03:25:05.092 --> 03:25:06.661
HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT.

03:25:06.727 --> 03:25:07.728
THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL BE

03:25:07.795 --> 03:25:08.996
USED TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO

03:25:09.063 --> 03:25:10.598
CORPORATE FAUCET ADVANCE CYBER

03:25:10.665 --> 03:25:12.533
MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT

03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:13.668
SOLUTIONS.

03:25:13.734 --> 03:25:14.869
THIS APPROACH WILL HELP IDENTIFY

03:25:14.935 --> 03:25:15.803
ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN BE

03:25:15.870 --> 03:25:17.405
PRACTICALLY IMPLEMENTED IN THE

03:25:17.471 --> 03:25:19.240
SHORT TERM ALSO DEVELOPING LONG

03:25:19.306 --> 03:25:20.941
TERM SOLUTIONS FOR FURTHER

03:25:21.008 --> 03:25:21.876
DEVELOPMENT.

03:25:21.942 --> 03:25:24.745
AND I'LL LET CDFA ADDRESS.

03:25:24.812 --> 03:25:26.247
THEIR PART OF THE PROGRAM AND I

03:25:26.313 --> 03:25:29.550
HAVE A CLARIFICATION IS THE FIVE

03:25:29.617 --> 03:25:31.886
POINT SEVEN AND CHANGE.

03:25:31.952 --> 03:25:33.988
IS THAT JUST FOR PEST MANAGEMENT

03:25:34.055 --> 03:25:39.393
ALTERNATIVES TO SIMPLY CORPORATE.

03:25:39.460 --> 03:25:41.529
FOR CLICK HERE AEROPRESS FOSS.

03:25:41.595 --> 03:25:43.597
OR IS IT ALL PEST MANAGEMENT --

03:25:43.664 --> 03:25:45.266
ALTERNATIVES IT'S KIND OF A DUAL

03:25:45.332 --> 03:25:47.201
PROCESS WHAT WE INTEND TO DO

03:25:47.268 --> 03:25:49.637
WHEN WE BEGIN THIS THE THE AS

03:25:49.704 --> 03:25:51.405
TASK FORCE WILL BE LOOKING AT

03:25:51.472 --> 03:25:53.107
ALTERNATIVES TO CORPORATE FALSE.

03:25:53.174 --> 03:25:54.175
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR FIRST

03:25:54.241 --> 03:25:57.078
ROUND -- SO THE THE ALTERNATIVE

03:25:57.144 --> 03:25:58.946
IS THE RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES

03:25:59.013 --> 03:26:00.715
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FUNDING WE

03:26:00.781 --> 03:26:04.518
WILL BE AT DPR DEVOTING THOSE

03:26:04.585 --> 03:26:05.119
TWO ALTERNATIVES TO CORPORATE

03:26:05.186 --> 03:26:06.020
FOSS.

03:26:06.087 --> 03:26:07.221
SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT MAYBE FOR

03:26:07.288 --> 03:26:09.090
THAT WHY NOW WE'RE HOPING THIS

03:26:09.156 --> 03:26:10.324
IS GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL

03:26:10.391 --> 03:26:11.225
PROJECT.

03:26:11.292 --> 03:26:13.160
AND IT WILL BE ABLE TO PERHAPS

03:26:13.227 --> 03:26:15.196
COME AGAIN NEXT YEAR AND TALK

03:26:15.262 --> 03:26:16.497
ABOUT CONTINUING SOME OF THE

03:26:16.564 --> 03:26:18.365
WORK OF THIS WORKGROUP TO LOOK

03:26:18.432 --> 03:26:19.767
AT THE OTHER MORE TOXIC

03:26:19.834 --> 03:26:21.402
ALTERNATIVES AND HOW WE MIGHT GO

03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:22.436
ABOUT DEVELOPING.

03:26:22.503 --> 03:26:26.140
SAFER MORE MANAGEABLE

03:26:26.207 --> 03:26:28.209
ALTERNATIVES CAM [inaudible]

03:26:28.275 --> 03:26:30.111
OKAY.

03:26:30.177 --> 03:26:32.179
WITH DRUG WE GOT WE GOT THE BAN

03:26:32.246 --> 03:26:34.115
ON CLERK -- FOSS NOW WE HAVE.

03:26:34.181 --> 03:26:35.049
ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS

03:26:35.116 --> 03:26:36.484
YEAH AND OUR COMPONENT IN THEIR

03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:37.885
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN ONE

03:26:37.952 --> 03:26:40.521
TIME WILL ACTUALLY AUGMENT FIVE

03:26:40.588 --> 03:26:41.922
HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND

03:26:41.989 --> 03:26:42.990
THAT WAS APPROVED IN GENERAL

03:26:43.057 --> 03:26:45.526
FUND FOR THIS YEAR ON GOING.

03:26:45.593 --> 03:26:46.927
AND THEN ALSO WE DO HAVE A

03:26:46.994 --> 03:26:49.830
REQUEST IN FOR BUDGET YEAR FOR

03:26:49.897 --> 03:26:52.566
AG FUND A SORTIE FOR ANOTHER --

03:26:52.633 --> 03:26:54.201
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN ONE MILLION

03:26:54.268 --> 03:26:55.536
DOLLARS IN A GOES TO IS CALLED I

03:26:55.603 --> 03:26:57.738
ARE FOR WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY

03:26:57.805 --> 03:26:58.973
THE USDA.

03:26:59.039 --> 03:27:00.541
AND WITH THAT PROGRAM DOES IT

03:27:00.608 --> 03:27:03.144
LOOKS TO FIND ALTERNATIVE

03:27:03.210 --> 03:27:04.745
PESTICIDES FOR SPECIALTY CROP

03:27:04.812 --> 03:27:07.148
GROWERS TO REPLACE SOME OF THESE

03:27:07.214 --> 03:27:09.150
ONES LIKE CHLORPYRIFOS.

03:27:09.216 --> 03:27:09.683
THAT ARE EITHER BEING DE

03:27:09.750 --> 03:27:11.552
REGISTERED OR FOR WHATEVER

03:27:11.619 --> 03:27:12.753
REASON BECOMING SO ESTRICTIVE

03:27:12.820 --> 03:27:14.321
TO USE WITH PERMIT CONDITIONS

03:27:14.388 --> 03:27:15.723
THAT IT'S NOT A VIABLE

03:27:15.790 --> 03:27:16.957
ALTERNATIVE FOR THE SPECIALLY

03:27:17.024 --> 03:27:18.125
CROP GROWERS.

03:27:18.192 --> 03:27:19.260
I JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW

03:27:19.326 --> 03:27:20.828
SPECIALLY CROP SOMETIMES DON'T

03:27:20.895 --> 03:27:21.896
GARNER THE ATTENTION FOR

03:27:21.962 --> 03:27:23.297
MANUFACTURERS OF SOME OF THESE

03:27:23.364 --> 03:27:25.466
ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS THERE LESS.

03:27:25.533 --> 03:27:27.001
TOXIC IN THE ENVIRONMENT LESS

03:27:27.067 --> 03:27:29.003
IMPACTFUL TO WORKERS AND OTHERS

03:27:29.069 --> 03:27:30.037
THAT COME IN CONTACT WITH THEM.

03:27:30.104 --> 03:27:31.906
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF NUMBERS

03:27:31.972 --> 03:27:33.440
BECAUSE OF LOW AMOUNT OF ACREAGE

03:27:33.507 --> 03:27:34.708
AND WEARS CORN AND SOYBEANS IN

03:27:34.775 --> 03:27:36.343
THE MIDWEST GETS THEIR ATTENTION

03:27:36.410 --> 03:27:39.747
BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A NUMBERS

03:27:39.814 --> 03:27:40.714
GAME.

03:27:40.781 --> 03:27:42.283
AND SO THE HIGHER FOR PROGRAM --

03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:44.051
TAKES ON PROJECTS ANNUALLY AND

03:27:44.118 --> 03:27:45.452
THEY TAKE ABOUT THREE TO FOUR

03:27:45.519 --> 03:27:47.755
YEARS TO COME TO FRUITION TO DO

03:27:47.822 --> 03:27:49.423
THE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THESE

03:27:49.490 --> 03:27:50.791
LABELS CAN ADD SOME OF THESE NEW

03:27:50.858 --> 03:27:52.193
SPECIALTY CROPS AND TRANSITION

03:27:52.259 --> 03:27:53.060
THEM TO SOME OF THESE OTHER

03:27:53.127 --> 03:27:54.395
MATERIALS THAT ARE CONSIDERED

03:27:54.461 --> 03:27:55.863
LESS TOXIC AND SAFER AND BETTER

03:27:55.930 --> 03:27:56.864
ALTERNATIVES. TO SOME OF THESE

03:27:56.931 --> 03:27:59.266
OLDER MATERIALS SO THAT'S THE

03:27:59.333 --> 03:27:59.934
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PART OF

03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:00.768
THAT.

03:28:00.835 --> 03:28:02.269
OF THE TWO MILLION PART OF THAT

03:28:02.336 --> 03:28:04.438
IS FOR BIOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED

03:28:04.505 --> 03:28:05.906
FARMING SYSTEMS ARE WHAT WE CALL

03:28:05.973 --> 03:28:06.640
BATHS.

03:28:06.707 --> 03:28:07.842
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY.

03:28:07.908 --> 03:28:09.777
SORT OF RESURRECTING IF YOU WILL

03:28:09.844 --> 03:28:11.645
THIS PROGRAM EXISTED OVER A

03:28:11.712 --> 03:28:13.347
DECADE AGO IN IT WAS A

03:28:13.414 --> 03:28:15.783
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOCUSED TO

03:28:15.850 --> 03:28:17.251
COME UP WITH BIOLOGICALLY

03:28:17.318 --> 03:28:18.652
INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS ARE

03:28:18.719 --> 03:28:19.553
TO USE.

03:28:19.620 --> 03:28:21.488
EXISTING BODY OF KNOWLEDGE IN

03:28:21.555 --> 03:28:23.324
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT ON

03:28:23.390 --> 03:28:25.025
DEMONSTRATION PLOT SO THE

03:28:25.092 --> 03:28:26.894
GROWERS COULD SEE FOR INSTANCE

03:28:26.961 --> 03:28:28.062
MAYBE THEIR NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE

03:28:28.128 --> 03:28:29.363
ROADS GROWING THE EXACT SAME

03:28:29.430 --> 03:28:30.531
TYPE OF CROP SO YOU KNOW THE

03:28:30.598 --> 03:28:32.299
LOCAL CONDITIONS EXIST THAT ARE

03:28:32.366 --> 03:28:33.567
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.

03:28:33.634 --> 03:28:35.135
YET THEY'RE DOCUMENTING A LOWER

03:28:35.202 --> 03:28:37.538
AMOUNT OF INPUTS AND ADOPTING

03:28:37.605 --> 03:28:40.441
PRACTICES LIKE ENHANCED SCOUTING

03:28:40.507 --> 03:28:42.676
AND WITHHOLDING TREATMENT UNTIL

03:28:42.743 --> 03:28:43.777
KNOWN ECONOMIC THRESHOLDS ARE

03:28:43.844 --> 03:28:45.079
MET SO THAT THEY CAN REDUCE

03:28:45.145 --> 03:28:46.213
PESTICIDE USAGE.

03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:47.314
THERE'S ALSO A COMPONENT THAT

03:28:47.381 --> 03:28:48.582
ALSO HELPS THEM TO MANAGE

03:28:48.649 --> 03:28:50.251
FERTILIZER USAGE WITHOUT

03:28:50.317 --> 03:28:51.585
SUFFERING YOUR LOSS OR QUALITY

03:28:51.652 --> 03:28:52.386
LOSS.

03:28:52.453 --> 03:28:53.988
AND SO IT'S REALLY JUST THAT

03:28:54.054 --> 03:28:54.855
TAKING THAT WHOLE INTEGRATED

03:28:54.922 --> 03:28:57.024
PEST MANAGEMENT BUT BIOLOGICALLY

03:28:57.091 --> 03:28:58.826
INTEGRATED APPROACH TO FARMING

03:28:58.893 --> 03:28:59.960
PUTTING IT OUT THERE.

03:29:00.027 --> 03:29:02.162
IN A VENUE LIKE DEMONSTRATION

03:29:02.229 --> 03:29:03.964
PROJECTS WHERE GROWERS CAN SEE

03:29:04.031 --> 03:29:05.532
FIRSTHAND AND BUILD THAT TRUST

03:29:05.599 --> 03:29:07.001
LEVEL THAT THESE TECHNIQUES ARE

03:29:07.067 --> 03:29:09.403
ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE AND WILL WORK.

03:29:09.470 --> 03:29:10.871
IN IN THE OUTCOME OBVIOUSLY AS

03:29:10.938 --> 03:29:12.106
THEY ADOPT THOSE TECHNIQUES AND

03:29:12.172 --> 03:29:13.374
WE HAVE LESS OF THOSE MATERIALS

03:29:13.440 --> 03:29:14.341
BEING USED.

03:29:14.408 --> 03:29:15.609
IN A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO

03:29:15.676 --> 03:29:16.744
FARMING WE KINDA SHIFT THE

03:29:16.810 --> 03:29:18.679
PARADIGM IF YOU WILL OVER TIME

03:29:18.746 --> 03:29:19.947
WHERE THEY'RE USING TECHNIQUES

03:29:20.014 --> 03:29:20.881
LIKE THAT.

03:29:20.948 --> 03:29:22.683
DO YOU FIND THEM OR DO THEY FIND

03:29:22.750 --> 03:29:27.655
YOU DO YOU ON THIS INTEGRATED.

03:29:27.721 --> 03:29:28.956
YOU KNOW.

03:29:29.023 --> 03:29:30.324
IN A GREAT FARMING SYSTEM TO GO

03:29:30.391 --> 03:29:31.325
OUT AND SAY HEY FARMER JONES

03:29:31.392 --> 03:29:32.092
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY THIS --

03:29:32.159 --> 03:29:33.527
ALTERNATIVE FARMING METHOD OR DO

03:29:33.594 --> 03:29:34.995
THEY COME TO YOU AND SAY.

03:29:35.062 --> 03:29:37.131
HEY I'VE GOT THIS ALTERNATE

03:29:37.197 --> 03:29:38.966
FARMING METHOD THAT LIKE THE TO

03:29:39.033 --> 03:29:41.769
THE USE IT AS A DEMONSTRATION

03:29:41.835 --> 03:29:42.236
PROJECT AND HAVE YOU.

03:29:42.303 --> 03:29:44.405
THE CORRECT THE UNIVERSITY HAS A

03:29:44.471 --> 03:29:46.206
BIG LARGE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE AND

03:29:46.273 --> 03:29:47.441
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY

03:29:47.508 --> 03:29:49.009
AVAILABLE TO GROWERS YOU OTHER

03:29:49.076 --> 03:29:50.811
WEBSITES PRETTY ROBUST THAT YOU

03:29:50.878 --> 03:29:51.245
CAN.

03:29:51.312 --> 03:29:52.613
SEARCH THE ROAD BY WHATEVER

03:29:52.680 --> 03:29:54.715
COMMODITY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

03:29:54.782 --> 03:29:55.282
AND WHAT PART OF THE STATE

03:29:55.349 --> 03:29:56.650
YOU'RE IN. FOR A LOT OF

03:29:56.717 --> 03:29:58.385
INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT WHAT'S

03:29:58.452 --> 03:29:59.653
REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE IS WHAT I

03:29:59.720 --> 03:30:01.155
MENTIONED DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

03:30:01.221 --> 03:30:02.656
OUR VISION OF THIS.

03:30:02.723 --> 03:30:04.091
IS TO GIVE OUT GRANTS OR

03:30:04.158 --> 03:30:06.126
CONTRACTS IS THE THERE AGAIN

03:30:06.193 --> 03:30:07.294
THREE WILL UC COOPERATIVE

03:30:07.361 --> 03:30:09.530
EXTENSION BECAUSE THEY WORK WITH

03:30:09.596 --> 03:30:10.364
GROWERS ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT

03:30:10.431 --> 03:30:11.231
ISSUES.

03:30:11.298 --> 03:30:12.566
AND SO THIS COULD ADD TO THEIR

03:30:12.633 --> 03:30:14.802
PORTFOLIO OF IDENTIFYING GROWERS

03:30:14.868 --> 03:30:16.337
SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MORE

03:30:16.403 --> 03:30:17.204
DIRECTLY I GUESS.

03:30:17.271 --> 03:30:20.207
I SEE THIS AS MORE OF PUTTING

03:30:20.274 --> 03:30:21.875
THAT OUT TO GROWERS TO SAY HERE

03:30:21.942 --> 03:30:23.744
SOME TECHNIQUES THAT WE FEEL ARE

03:30:23.811 --> 03:30:25.479
VERY EFFECTIVE IN THIS AREA THAT

03:30:25.546 --> 03:30:28.615
WE CAN DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU AND

03:30:28.682 --> 03:30:30.284
HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE.

03:30:30.351 --> 03:30:32.152
LA -- PEST MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS.

03:30:32.219 --> 03:30:33.654
WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH

03:30:33.721 --> 03:30:34.388
THIS PROPOSAL [inaudible]

03:30:34.455 --> 03:30:37.458
CENTER MONEY.

03:30:37.524 --> 03:30:39.126
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST

03:30:39.193 --> 03:30:40.928
WANT TO THANK BOTH DEPARTMENTS

03:30:40.995 --> 03:30:42.596
IN PARTICULAR THE GOVERNOR'S

OFFICE FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND

03:30:44.832 --> 03:30:46.800
MOVING FORWARD IN [inaudible]

03:30:46.867 --> 03:30:49.236
WELL CHLORPYRIFOS IS FACING

03:30:49.303 --> 03:30:50.637
CANCELLATION.
