SCIENCE COURSEWORK.

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:16.260
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:17.594
HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:19.162

EVEN OFFER A COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:24.001
COURSE. AND THE PRIMARY REASON

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:25.502
FOR THAT IS A LACK OF TEACHERS

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.705
TRAINED TO TEACH THE SUBJECT. AB

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:30.574

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:33.710
INTRODUCING COMPUTER SCIENCE AT

00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:35.279
A YOUNG AGE WILL HELP TO ENSURE

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:36.913
THAT ALL STUDENTS DEVELOP

PREPARE THEM FOR COLLEGE CAREERS

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:44.254
AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. AND WE CAN

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:46.523
ACHIEVE THAT BY INVESTING MORE

WE'RE HAVING THE SCHOOLS RIGHT

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:40.397
NOW I TALKED TO AN ASSISTANT

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:40.997
SUPERINTENDENT THE OTHER DAY-

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.098

ANYTHING LIKE THIS IS WHAT'S

00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:44.868
GOING ON OUT THERE RIGHT. AND

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.703
SHE HAS A HARD TO GET CLASSIFIED

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.004
STAFF SHOULD ABSOLUTELY THAT'S

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:49.406
ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE RIGHT

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:50.040
SPECIAL ALWAYS MANAGES TO THE

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:51.007
UNIQUE THING THAT'S HAPPENING

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:52.108
RIGHT NOW. THIS TEACHERS ARE

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:53.443
LEAVING THE TEACHING PROFESSION

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.345
MAJOR. CHANGES I'VE NEVER SEEN

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:56.880
THAT BEFORE. USUALLY THEY GO TO

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:58.448
ANOTHER DISTRICT RIGHT. BUT

00:51:58.515 --> 00:52:00.517
THEY'RE COMPLETELY LEAVING THE

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.519
TEACHING PROFESSION SO YOU IF

00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:04.354
YOU LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:04.921
PROPOSED BUDGET. WITH A FIVE

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:07.090

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:08.458
INADEQUATE YOUNGER PEOPLE SAY

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:11.828

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.067
THREE. RIGHT THERE ARE ALMOST

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:18.835
TEN RIGHT. THEN YOU ADD ABOUT 4%

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:20.003
COSTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO SCHOOL

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.471

SCHOOLS RECEIVING STATE FUNDING

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.725
HOWEVER IT IS AN OVERWHELMING

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.060
BURDEN TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:25.528

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:10.740
BREATH GOING INTO THE CLASSROOM

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:11.841

ABILITY TO PAY ATTENTION READ

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:29.759

OVERWHELMING FINANCIAL BURDEN

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.674
BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CORRECT

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.743

THAT. NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:57.872
THEY DON'T PHONE NUMBER BECAUSE

01:27:57.939 --> 01:27:59.340

ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR. STUDENTS

01:38:15.856 --> 01:38:17.758
WHO ARE BEING EDUCATED ABOUT THE

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:19.994
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:22.630
CLEARLY BETTER PREPARED TO FIGHT

01:38:22.696 --> 01:38:24.398
FOR A BETTER FUTURE. BUT NOT ALL

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:26.367
CHILDREN ARE BEING PROVIDED THE

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:29.169
OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN. I ALSO

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:31.572
KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.173
LEARN ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.942

SCHOOL DAY. CALIFORNIA HAS

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:45.185
CERTAINLY MADE SOME PROGRESS ON

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:46.020
ADVANCING CLIMATE CHANGE

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:48.155
LITERACY BUT THERE REMAINS MUCH

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:50.324
WORK TO BE DONE TO TEACH THESE

01:38:50.391 --> 01:38:52.459
TOPICS AND OUR SCHOOLS SINCE THE

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:55.095
STATE'S ATTEMPTS TO TEACH ABOUT

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:57.364
CLIMATE CHANGE REMAIN OPTIONAL.

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.099
RECOGNIZING THAT EDUCATION IS

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:01.101
THE FIRST STEP IN COMBATING

01:39:01.168 --> 01:39:03.237

REQUIREMENT OF EDUCATION.

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:18.252
MEANWHILE IN THE US NEW JERSEY

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:19.987
IS THE FIRST STATE TO REQUIRE

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:22.923
SCHOOLS TO TEACH CLIMATE CHANGE

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.725
. CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY FALLING

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:26.126
BEHIND OTHER STATES AND

01:39:26.193 --> 01:39:27.928
COUNTRIES THAT TEACH ABOUT

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:30.097
CLIMATE CHANGE AS A RESULT WERE

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:32.366

PAYING AN IMPACTFUL STEM CAREERS

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:17.937
AND WE WANT OUR TEACHERS TO HAVE

01:56:18.004 --> 01:56:18.805

IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED AB

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:28.114
TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE WHICH

01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:28.915
WILL IMPROVE MATH AND SCIENCE

01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:30.683
INSTRUCTION BY INVESTING IN

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:32.218
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:33.386
SCIENCE AND MATH TEACHERS AND

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:35.355
TEACHER LEADERS THE APPROACH OF

01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:37.757
AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE IS TO

01:56:37.824 --> 01:56:40.193
BUILD ON WHAT WE KNOW WORKS

01:56:40.259 --> 01:56:41.361
COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE FOR

01:56:41.427 --> 01:56:43.296

HOW WE TRAIN TEACHERS TO TEACH

01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:59.879
SCIENCE AND MATH WE CAN MAKE

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:00.813
THESE COURSES MORE ACCESS TO

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.882
OUR- STUDENT POPULATION. IT WILL

01:57:02.949 --> 01:57:05.718
ALSO HELP EDUCATORS LEARN HOW TO

01:57:05.785 --> 01:57:07.453
TEACH SCIENCE AND MATH IN WAYS

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.788
THAT ENGAGE STUDENTS. AND I AM

01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:10.022
