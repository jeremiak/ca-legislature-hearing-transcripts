SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY WILL PROHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM AUTHORIZING THEIR OFFICERS TO WEAR UNIFORMS THAT ARE COMMON FLIES OR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES. OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS A NUMBER OF PHOTOS AND VIDEOS HAVE CIRCULATED SHOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT AT PROTESTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH SOME OFFICERS WEARING HEAD TO TOE CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS. FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN THESE UNIFORMS BEARS SUCH A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE WORN BY OUR MILITARY THAT MANY HAVE TROUBLE TELLING THE TWO GROUPS APART. THIS IS WRONG. OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY SHOULD NOT LOOK LIKE ARMED FORCES. SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY WILL ENSURE THAT THIS CONFUSION DOES NOT HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA BY BANNING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM AUTHORIZING THE USE OF COMMERCE CLAUSE AND BY ENSURING LAW ENFORCEMENT UNIFORMS ARE PROPERLY LABELED.
