BE AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:24.620
WHICH REQUIRES THREE THINGS

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:25.822

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:37.367
NINETY NINE IT IMPRESSED

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.068

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.536
TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:43.139

AND PARENTS THIS IS WAS AFFORD.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:23.246
THE SECOND WAS THAT REGIONAL

ABOUT A COUNTRY TO THE LEDGE.

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:31.120
INTENT OF GRASS NINE FORTY. THE

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.189
THIRD OPTION WAS JUST ACCEPT

WAS COVERED. EVEN THOUGH IT

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.659

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:37.693
EVEN BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.729
CHILD. IT ALSO RESULTED IN A

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.764
LONGER TERM CARE. BECAUSE YOU

COSTING THE CHILD TIME THAT CAN

THINGS WERE COMING UP WITH

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:54.790
DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS- THIS IS

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:58.427
ABOUT. MAKING SURE A DOCTOR CAN

MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:05.434
TO HELP KIDS. THE FACT THAT IT

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.803
IS GETTING SUCH OPPOSITION FROM

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:10.439
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES-

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:12.174

COMMENTS ARE MAKING IT ABOUT

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:17.479
AND I IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:18.881
BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.816

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:23.585
EACH OTHER. AND I JUST I'M

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:25.888
FRUSTRATED AS A DAD. AS A

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:28.724
LEGISLATOR AS A POLICY MAKER

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:30.058

WE- SENATOR STONE WAS BROUGHT

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:33.896
TO TEARS THINKING ABOUT HIS

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:35.697

FAMILIES WHO. FIND A BENEFIT

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.739
FROM THIS TREATMENT FROM

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:45.140
MULTIPLE TREATMENTS. BUT

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.175
BECAUSE OF A FLAW IN THE

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:47.876
DRAFTING HAS CREATED A

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:49.878
MONOPOLY. AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:52.281
TO GIVE UP THE MONOPOLY. AND I

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.816
JUST THINK WE NEED TO EMBRACE

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:55.384
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.786

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:57.531
AVAILABLE. SO I DO SEE THE

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:59.566
INTENT PYRRHUS- EXCELLENT

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:01.201
ACTUALLY IN. THE FACILITY

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:02.703
SUPPORTING THE BILL THINK

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:05.839
MANAGER. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:07.574
ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:11.612
CORRECT THANK YOU- SENATOR

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:12.613
SKINNER FOR BRINGING THIS

01:44:12.679 --> 01:44:14.715
FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:17.017
WORK THAT YOU- DID OVER THE

01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:18.986
BREAK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.887
THE ADVOCATES YOU KNOW I WANT

01:44:20.954 --> 01:44:21.855
TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE

01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:22.823
SHARED BY MY COLLEAGUES A

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:24.925
CRIMINAL RECORD DOES NOT

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:26.994
NECESSARILY PREDICATED ON SAFE

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:30.163
CONDITIONS- OR EVEN THAT IT IS

01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:31.765
AND SAFE IN SOMEONE'S HOME WHEN

01:44:31.832 --> 01:44:33.634
I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT ONE

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:34.901
OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES THE

01:44:34.968 --> 01:44:37.604
FAMILY SUCCESS IS BREAKING

01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:40.540
FAMILIES UP- AND AS OFTEN AS WE

01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:42.009
ARE IN PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:43.610
AND OTHER COMMITTEES LISTENING

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:45.979
TO THE STORIES MOSTLY TOLD BY-

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:48.615
BLACKENED BROWN FATHERS. WHO

01:44:48.682 --> 01:44:50.250
ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:53.387
CHILDREN- BECAUSE OF PAST

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:57.324
BEHAVIOR- IS ONE OF THE MOST.

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:59.259
EGREGIOUS I THINK IN TELLING

01:44:59.326 --> 01:45:01.261
SIGNS OF AN INABILITY FOR

01:45:01.328 --> 01:45:04.097
FAMILIES TO HEAL- IN CHILDREN

01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:06.233
TO HAVE A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:08.502
WHO THEIR PARENTS ARE. AND WE

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:11.805
HAVE REALLY DONE A DISSERVICE.

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:14.675
TO OUR FATHERS. IN THIS CYCLE

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:18.445
OF POVERTY AND FEAR. AND IN

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:20.781
DOING SO WE HAVE UNDERSCORED

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:22.783
THIS FALSEHOOD THAT THEY ARE

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:26.720
IRREDEEMABLE. THEY ARE SO BAD

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:28.822
THAT THEY DON'T EVEN DESERVE TO

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:31.792
HAVE- ACCESS TO THEIR CHILDREN

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:32.926
TO HAVE THEM PLACED IN THEIR

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:35.095
HOME OR IN THE HOME OF ONE OF

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:37.330
THEIR RELATIVES- AND WE HAVE

01:45:37.397 --> 01:45:38.899
GOT TO MOVE FORWARD AND

01:45:38.965 --> 01:45:41.168
DISMANTLE- THOSE KINDS OF

01:45:41.234 --> 01:45:43.904
FALSEHOODS IN MISPERCEPTIONS SO

01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:45.138
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:45:45.205 --> 01:45:46.406
BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:47.541
IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:45:47.607 --> 01:45:49.009
DIRECTION FOR HOW WE ALLOW OUR

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:51.044
FAMILIES TO HEAL. AND I WILL BE

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:57.084
SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU-

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:58.385
TENER SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:45:58.452 --> 01:46:00.454
CLOSE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.222
CARE AND APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:04.691
A COMMENT SANDRA YES IT DOES

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:07.127
THE BILL WAS IMPROVED. AND I

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:12.032
THINK WHICH- ONE IT SQUARELY

01:46:12.099 --> 01:46:12.632
PUTS THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD

01:46:12.699 --> 01:46:16.136
FIRST IT EXEMPTS A NUMBER OF

01:46:16.203 --> 01:46:18.205
CONVICTIONS A GOOD DEAL OF THEM.

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:20.307
AND IT PUTS IT- STREAM OR DID

01:46:20.373 --> 01:46:22.442
STREAMLINED NOT THE RIGHT WORD

01:46:22.509 --> 01:46:23.543
HE CLARIFIES THE PROCESS THAT

01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:27.748
HAS TO BE GONE THROUGH FOR. THE

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:29.916
ROSS'S FOR DETERMINING WHETHER

01:46:29.983 --> 01:46:31.485
THE PAST CONVICTION SHOULD BE

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:34.321
APPLIED OR NOT. NOW ONE THING I

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:36.056
WOULD RAISE SNOWED IN THE BILL

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:37.691
AT THE MOMENT BUT- AT SOME

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:39.426
POINT IN THE FUTURE WE MAY WANT

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:40.761
TO LOOK AT THAT LIST OF PAST

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:43.063
CONVICTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU SEE

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:43.997
IT LOOK AT IT IS QUITE

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:46.133
EXTENSIVE. AND WE ARE MAKING

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:50.137
CHANGES NOW TO SENTENCING THAT

01:46:50.203 --> 01:46:52.305
CLARIFY DIFFERENT CRIMES WE'VE%

01:46:52.372 --> 01:46:55.242
HAD IN MANY CASES IN CALIFORNIA

01:46:55.308 --> 01:46:58.411
AN OVERLY BROAD. SET OF IN THE

01:46:58.478 --> 01:47:00.046
PENAL CODE SAID OF SENSING SO

01:47:00.113 --> 01:47:01.715
IF I TAKE FELONY MURDER FOR

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:04.951
EXAMPLE. FELONY MURDER IMPLIES

01:47:05.018 --> 01:47:07.454
THAT YOU MURDERED WE HAVE- THE

01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:08.922
LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WE

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:12.292
REVISE THAT LAW SO THAT. IN

01:47:12.359 --> 01:47:13.160
ORDER TO BE CONVICTED OF FELONY

01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:15.762
MURDER. YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO

01:47:15.829 --> 01:47:18.365
HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC ROLE OR

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:20.734
INTENT TO KILL IT. HOWEVER

01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:21.401
THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE

01:47:21.468 --> 01:47:22.435
CONVICTED OF FELONY MURDER

01:47:22.502 --> 01:47:24.604
WITHOUT THAT MANY OF THEM NOW

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:26.540
HAVE BEEN RESENTENCED. HAVING

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:28.375
BEEN RESENTENCED THOUGH YOU

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:28.875
STILL HAD THAT ORIGINAL

01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:32.045
CONVICTION. SO HOPEFULLY THIS

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:35.015
BILL WOULD NOT. ELIMINATE THE

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:36.149
ABILITY OF A PERSON WHO IS

01:47:36.216 --> 01:47:38.185
RESENTENCED FOR EXAMPLE FROM

01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:40.654
BEING ABLE TO BE A CARE GIVER

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.822
IF THEY'RE IN THE SITUATION

01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:43.723
EITHER YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:44.891
TRY TO GET THEIR CHILD BACK

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.459
WERE IF THEY WERE IN A

01:47:46.526 --> 01:47:47.327
SITUATION WHERE ANOTHER FAMILY

01:47:47.394 --> 01:47:50.831
MEMBER. WAS WHATEVER A CHILD

01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:52.332
WAS REMOVED FROM THAT FAMILY

01:47:52.399 --> 01:47:53.099
MEMBER AND YOU WERE TRYING TO

01:47:53.166 --> 01:47:55.068
FIND A RELATIVE TO PUT THE

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:58.305
CHILD IN THE PLACE- I DID NOT

01:47:58.371 --> 01:48:00.173
GO INTO THE DETAIL TO DETERMINE

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.542
FOR EXAMPLE. IF THE BILL IS

01:48:02.609 --> 01:48:04.377
WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY. TO HELP

01:48:04.444 --> 01:48:06.413
INSURE THAT BUT I RECENT ONLY

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:09.382
BECAUSE- WHILE IT IS LEGITIMATE

01:48:09.449 --> 01:48:10.283
FOR US TO BE CAUTIOUS AND

01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:12.586
LEGITIMATE FOR US ALWAYS TO

01:48:12.652 --> 01:48:14.387
MAKE THE CHILDREN SAFETY FIRST.

01:48:14.454 --> 01:48:17.424
USING A LIST OF PAST CRIMINAL

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.391
CONVICTIONS DOES NOT

01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:21.795
NECESSARILY INFORM US. IN

01:48:21.862 --> 01:48:22.896
RELATIONSHIP TO THE CHILD

01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:24.931
SAFETY. SO I JUST RAISE IT AS

01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:26.266
FOOD FOR THOUGHT AS WE MOVE ON

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.068
AND FUTURE. I THINK THE BILL IS

01:48:28.134 --> 01:48:29.936
IN GOOD SHAPE NOW AND I REALLY

01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:30.937

DONE ON IT. AND I THINK IT

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:38.011
WILL- GREATLY HELP US WE HAVE

01:48:38.078 --> 01:48:40.080
SO MANY CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE

01:48:40.146 --> 01:48:42.649
IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'VE HAD

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:44.751
DIFFICULTY GETTING PLACEMENT

01:48:44.818 --> 01:48:46.486
FOR THEM SO IF THIS IMPROVES

01:48:46.553 --> 01:48:47.687
THAT. THEN IT'S A GREAT STEP

01:48:47.754 --> 01:48:49.522
