TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM.

00:30:50.281 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT WAS WORKABLE AND WE

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:53.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THAT THE

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:55.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROGRAM IS WORKING NOW. IS JUST

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:56.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:59.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THE ASSESSMENTS ALLOW THE

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AUDITOR TO COME IN A PRIOR TO

THE ISSUE PUBLICLY TO TO BRING

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:07.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GREATER CONCERN A GREATER AND I

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD ARGUE UNNECESSARY CONCERN

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:10.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
TO HIGHLIGHT.

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:13.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT MAY BE HAPPENING IN A CITY

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OR A SPECIAL DISTRICT I THINK

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:17.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S EVIDENT BY THE WAY THE

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROGRAM'S BEEN WORKING SO FAR?

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE WAY THAT IT'S HAPPENED SO

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:20.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
FOR THE.

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:22.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE AUDITOR HAS LISTED SIX

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:25.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
CITIES.

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:26.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
TO BE.

00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:29.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THAT THAT IDENTIFIED AS HIGH

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RISK TO DO MISSUS AND I DO

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:31.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ASSESSMENT AND FOR SPECIAL

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
DISTRICTS THREE.

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:34.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AFTER DOING THE INITIAL

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:35.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASSESSMENT FATHER DETERMINE THAT

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:37.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY ONLY NEEDED TO DO THREE

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:39.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AUDITS OF THE CITIES OF THREE

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AFTER THE ASSESSMENT DIDN'T

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REQUIRE AN AUDIT. AND FOR THE

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:44.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPECIAL DISTRICTS NONE OF THEM

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:46.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REQUIRE THE AUDIT AND SO THAT IS

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:47.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EVIDENT THAT THAT THAT THE

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:51.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM IS WORKING AND IT WASN'T.

00:31:51.175 --> 00:31:52.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:53.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I DON'T SEE WHY WASTING TIME

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:54.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE THESE THESE ARE VERY

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IMPORTANT ISSUES.

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:58.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW WHAT'S

00:31:58.082 --> 00:31:59.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HAPPENING IN THESE LOCAL

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:00.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AGENCIES IN DETERMINE THEIR

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:01.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THEIR FINANCIAL RISK.

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:03.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:04.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
WITH REGARD TO.

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:07.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I APPRECIATE THE THE AUTHOR IS

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:09.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRYING TO ASSIST IN MAKING SURE

00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:11.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT THAT THE PROGRAM IS IS

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:12.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MEETING THE LETTER OF THE LAW.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:15.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
RATHER THEN.

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:18.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CHANGING THE PROGRAM TO MEET

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:20.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE EXISTING LA THAT WE WOULD

00:32:20.371 --> 00:32:22.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHANGE THE LA TO MEET THE WAY

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THE THE FUNCTIONING PROGRAM

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:26.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS WORKING. AND SO ALONG THOSE

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LINES WE PLAN ON SUPPORTING THE

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:30.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
LARA BILL.

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:32.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH REGARD TO AT THE ANALOGY TO

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:36.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SEARCH WARRANT. AND WHILE I

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:38.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
APPRECIATE IT THE I THINK THE

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:39.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DIFFERENCE IS FOR PUBLIC

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGENCIES IS THIS IS ALL PUBLICLY

00:32:40.892 --> 00:32:42.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AVAILABLE INFORMATION THERE IS

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
NO. REQUIREMENT TO.

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:47.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ROUTE SEEK YOU KNOW THAT

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:50.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PERMISSION TO ASK FOR THIS

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:52.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INFORMATION THE PUBLIC CAN THIS.

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:53.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OVER THE PHONE ASK FOR THIS

00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:54.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
INFORMATION.

00:32:54.672 --> 00:32:56.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT

00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:57.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THAT IS A NECESSARY CHECK

00:32:57.809 --> 00:32:59.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I THINK THAT WOULD THE WAY

00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:00.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THIS IS BEING PROPOSED TO

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:02.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BE DONE. IF THE AUDITOR WERE TO

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:06.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COME TO V. J. LIKE COMMITTEE TO

ASK MAY I DO AN ASSESSMENT.

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:09.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

JAILER COMMITTEE. I WOULD ASSUME

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:14.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD BE FORCED TO APPROVE ALL

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:15.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OF THEM.

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:16.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
AND SAY YES.

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:17.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEAH WE WE DON'T OBJECT TO YOU

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:19.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
DOING AN ASSESSMENT.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:23.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S A BAD THING I DON'T THINK

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:25.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WE WE APPRECIATE THE WAY

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:26.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THE PROGRAM IS IN THAT.

00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:28.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHEN THE AUDITOR DETERMINES

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AFTER AN ASSESSMENT THAT THEY

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:31.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WANT TO DO AN AUDIT THAT THEY

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:32.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

AND THE PUBLIC AGENCY HAS AN

OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEFORE THAT

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:36.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMMITTEE AND AND MAKE THEIR

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:12.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE THINGS THAT I HAVE FOUND

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:14.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH CONSTITUENTS OVER AND OVER

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:15.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS THEY HAVE VERY VERY LITTLE

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:16.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
KNOWLEDGE.

00:39:16.954 --> 00:39:18.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF WHAT THE PROCESSES ARE NOT

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:21.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONLY FOR VERYBASIC THINGS LIKE

00:39:21.592 --> 00:39:23.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOW YOU VOTE BROWN ACT ALL OF

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:24.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THESE OTHER THINGS BUT WHEN IT

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:27.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMES TO ISSUES. THAT THERE'S

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:28.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CONCERN OVER.

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:31.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STEP MAYBE TO THE STATE ON AN

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
AUDIT.

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:36.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I CAN GUARANTEE THAT ALL VERY

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FEW PEOPLE EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:39.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT IS SO IT'S NOT ONLY THE

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WORK OF THE AUDITOR BUT IT'S

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:43.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ALSO THE INFORMATION THAT IS

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:44.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BROUGHT BACK TO OUR LOCAL

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:46.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMMUNITIES. TO OUR COUNTIES AND

00:39:46.817 --> 00:39:48.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT REALLY IS WHAT I APPRECIATE

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:50.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE.

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S ONE THING FOR PEOPLE THAT

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:55.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE IN HOUSE SO MANY THE PEOPLE

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:57.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE IN THE AUDIENCE HERE MANY OF

00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:58.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE PEOPLE HERE WE COME TO SPEAK

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:00.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE SAME LANGUAGE A IN MANY WAYS

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:02.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT WHEN YOU GO OUT TO THE

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:04.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AVERAGE CONSTITUENT YOU WHICH IS

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:06.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHO WE SERVE. THEY NEED TO

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDERSTAND AND HAVE FAITH THAT

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:10.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
UP. AND CONFIDENCE IN THE

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:13.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROCESSES WE TAKE AND UP MANY

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:14.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TIMES THERE'S COMPLAINT AND THEY

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:16.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE NO IDEA WHO TO GO TO. AND

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO THEIR FIRST STEP IS PROBABLY

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:20.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT ONCE YOU

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:22.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
START TO DRILL DOWN.

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:23.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS AGREE ON

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:24.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT THE RESULT IS THAT THEY

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:25.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WANT BUT THEY DO WANT

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:27.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TRANSPARENCY THEY DO WANT

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:28.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THINK ON

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:34.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORDS I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:36.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

HOPE THAT.

THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:08.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

I I KNOW THAT IN THE SCOPE OF

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

DUPLICATIVE REGULATIONS BUT

AGAIN LOOKING AT WHETHER IT BE

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SMALL OR LARGE BUSINESSES

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:44.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

NECESSARILY ABOUT. A GOVERNMENT

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:47.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:49.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
BUSINESSES.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:51.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY OFTEN JUST DON'T KNOW WHICH

WAY TO WEED THROUGH. AND WE HEAR

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:57.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

EXTREME ABOUT EVERYBODY.

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:00.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MOVING TO TEXAS I DON'T ARIZONA

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:02.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE I KNOW

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:03.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE ARE INNOVATIVE HERE AND

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE. A AS PEOPLE

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:07.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
LEAVE PEOPLE ARE COMING.

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:08.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT I CONTINUE TO HEAR AS A

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:13.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEME I NOT ONLY LOCALLY BUT I

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:15.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE DONE MANY MANY BUSINESS

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TOWARD TAURUS IS. JUST THEY'RE

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:20.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT SURE ABOUT WHERE TO START

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE HAVE WORKED IN THE JOBS

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMITTEE ON THINGS LIKE MASTER

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:24.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUSINESS LICENCE SO THAT THEY

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN GO ON. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:29.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IS UP AN OLD PIECE OF

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:30.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
LEGISLATION MAYBE WHAT'S

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOMETHING NEW ON TOP OF THAT

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:33.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT'S UP SOMETHING NEW THAT

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:37.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY HAVE TO. ADJUST TO AND SO I

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:38.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:39.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND WE'RE

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:41.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TALKING ABOUT LET'S GO AHEAD AND

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AUDIT AGENCIES AND LET'S GO

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

SAYING WELL WE DON'T WANT TO DO

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:48.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT IN THIS CASE SO I THINK

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:50.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY FACE THE

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:52.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FACT THAT IF WE DON'T START TO

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:54.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
LOOK. AT ALL OF THE.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LAYERS AND LAYERS UPON UP

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:58.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEGISLATION THERE'S JUST A POINT

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WHERE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:02.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PARTICULARLY BUT ALSO OTHER

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:08.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
EMPLOYERS.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEN EXAMPLE IS I MET WITH A

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:10.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MANUFACTURER FURNITURE.

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:12.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
pFURNITURE IS NOT MADE HERE

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:13.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ANYMORE ONES THAT ARE STILL

AND OF COURSE WE SHOULD ALWAYS

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:26.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENCOURAGED AGENCIES A TO LOOK

THAT NEED TO BE MODERNIZED OR

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:31.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
STREAMLINED.

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:32.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AYE WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT EVERY AGENCY CAN USE THAT

01:37:21.702 --> 01:37:23.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN GOING

RESPECT TO POSITIONS OF THE OF

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:52.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW YOU'RE

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:53.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TALKING TO A MEMBER HERE THAT

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:54.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VIRTUALLY EVERY YEAR OF IN THE

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:55.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEGISLATURE OF A HUNDRED PERCENT

POSITION BY DOING THIS OPERAS AT

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:06.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE SAME TIME I THINK WHAT HAS

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO BE RECOGNIZED IS THAT. YOU

01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:08.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW YOU COULD HAVE ANY AGENCY

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:09.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REGULATION THAT GETS DEVELOP

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:12.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEALL REVIEWED ARE REVIEWED AYE

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:13.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND POTENTIALLY AUGMENTED BUT

01:38:13.587 --> 01:38:14.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE REALITY IS IS THAT. YOU KNOW

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:17.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DURING A TIME OF TERM LIMITS I'M

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:18.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SURE THERE WERE A LOT OF

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:19.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POLITICAL REASONS WHY CERTAIN

01:38:19.126 --> 01:38:21.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BILLS MAY HAVE PASSED. AT AND IF

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:23.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S SOMETHING AS PASSED BY LAW

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:24.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU CAN'T JUST ELIMINATED IT IN

01:38:24.965 --> 01:38:26.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LAW CODIFIED BY LAW PASSED BY

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:27.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:29.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THE GOVERNOR. AND SO.

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:30.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT'S NOT JUST EASILY

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:32.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISPENSED WITH AND SO I I DON'T

01:38:32.439 --> 01:38:34.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK IT'S A ARE UNFAIR AND AND

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:35.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN.

01:38:35.809 --> 01:38:37.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO TAKE THE TIME TO REVIEW ALL

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:38.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE STATE REGULATIONS THAT WE

01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:39.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:38:39.813 --> 01:38:41.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

FOR AND AGAIN THIS STUDY MAY

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:49.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TURN UP SAYING THAT THERE ARE

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:51.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NONE AND I'M FINE WITH THAT BUT

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:52.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND

01:38:52.826 --> 01:38:54.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OUR OVERSIGHT CAPACITY WHICH.

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:55.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

ATTENTION ON.

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:01.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WE TAKE THE TIME TO TAKE

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:02.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT THAT THAT REGULATORY

01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:03.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
OVERSIGHT.

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:04.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S IT'S PART OF OUR JOBS PART

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:05.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF OUR DUTY I THINK IT'S

01:39:05.939 --> 01:39:06.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPORTANT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:07.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AN AYE VOTE WOULD DEFERRED ANY

JOINT AUTHORED.

01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:11.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WELL I THINK THE OUT DATED

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:13.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMPONENTS MOST IMPORTANT ONE

01:39:13.347 --> 01:39:14.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THE WORLD

01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:16.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CHANGES.

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:17.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ON A DAILY WEEKLY MONTHLY YEARLY

01:39:17.551 --> 01:39:19.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
BASIS.

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:20.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AS FOR REGULATION DRAFTED A

01:39:20.854 --> 01:39:23.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POINT IN TIME WHICH MAKES SENSE.

01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:24.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DON'T KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN

01:39:24.858 --> 01:39:26.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

01:39:26.827 --> 01:39:28.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO THIS ELEMENT OF LOOKING

01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:31.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR ANY ASPECT OF OUTDATED NESS.

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:33.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE APA

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:35.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM IS REALLY SET UP A FUND

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
INTO TO CONFRONT.

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:37.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THERE DOOR TRYING TO ADOPT

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:39.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
TIMELY REGULATIONS.

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:41.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:41.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH

01:39:41.508 --> 01:39:43.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
REVOLUTIONS.

01:39:43.777 --> 01:39:44.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IN THE WAY BUSINESS IS

CONDUCTED.

01:39:45.612 --> 01:39:47.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS WE ALL WELL KNOW SO I THINK

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:48.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
THAT'S A.

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:51.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:52.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OPPOSITION IS NOT RESPONSIVE THE

01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:54.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OUTDATED ASPECT AND AGAIN I

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:57.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK AS A ELECTED OFFICIALS IT
