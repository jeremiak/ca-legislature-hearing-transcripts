TWO THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:27.138
INVOLVED WITH THOSE PROJECTS

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:27.438
[inaudible]

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:28.673
AND SO.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.007
THE M. IN OUR ALTHOUGH WE DON'T

00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:31.509

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:32.910
WE DO EXPECT OVER THE LIFE OF

SO IS THIS IN DIRECT RESULT OF

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.956
THE EIGHTIES OF THE DEMISE OF

00:33:58.336 --> 00:33:59.971
HEALTH ISSUES.

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:01.773
I THINK YOU KNOW THIS IS FOUNDED

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:03.408
FOR SOMETIME BUT TO WITH THAT

00:34:03.474 --> 00:34:04.809
IT'S REALLY THE THE PASSAGE OF

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:05.977
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT I

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:07.945
THINK A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:08.579
THE CREATE THE IMPETUS FOR THIS

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:09.514
TO HAPPEN.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.681
THIS PROGRAM NO PLACE LIKE HOME

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:13.084
IS ACTUALLY A SUCCESSOR PROGRAM

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:13.651
TO ONE THAT WAS RUN BY THE

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:15.186
CALIFORNIA HOUSING HE HAS HAD TO

00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:16.687
FIGHT INSURGENCY THE MENTAL

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:17.789
HEALTH SERVICES LIKE HOUSING

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:18.456
PROGRAM.

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:19.857
THIS IS SORT OF A SECOND

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:21.125
ITERATION OF IT --

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:22.593
BUT WE I THINK THE THE

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.895
REALIZATION WAS MADE SOMETIME

00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:26.330
AGO THAT YOU KNOW THE BEST WAY

00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:27.799
TO SOLVE CHRONIC ILLNESSES IS TO

00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:28.800
GET PEOPLE HOUSE.

00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:30.034
ONCE WE GET THEM HOUSE THEN WE

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:30.635
START WORKING WITH THEM ON

00:34:30.701 --> 00:34:32.403
SERVICES GETTING THEM ON TO

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.938
TREATMENT PLANS AND WHAT NOT --

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:36.140
BUT IT'S SORT OF THE BEST

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:36.441
PRACTICES --

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:39.710
NOW MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:41.512
SUES THE SAID PERMANENT

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:43.247
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR IS A IS

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:45.483
THERE A TRANSITIONAL.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.884
COMPONENT OF THIS HOUSING PLAN

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:47.585
ALSO -- NOT

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:48.986
NOT PROGRAMS FOR PROGRAM THIS

00:34:49.053 --> 00:34:50.221
PROGRAM IS SOLELY PERMANENT

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:51.355
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SO THERE ARE

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:52.590
NO LIMITATIONS ON THE LENGTH OF

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:54.225
STAY.

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:55.359
THERE'S BEEN SOMEONE OF A MOVE

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.994
AWAY FROM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING

00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:57.895
THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS LAST

00:34:57.962 --> 00:34:58.830
COULD BE YEARS IN LIKE

00:34:58.896 --> 00:35:00.264
VERTICALLY FOR POPULATION LIKE

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:01.732
THIS WHICH IS NOT HAVING IT KIND

00:35:01.799 --> 00:35:03.434
OF A TRANSITIONAL EVENT.

00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:05.269
OF FOLKS IN THIS CATEGORY OFTEN

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:06.804
NEED TO LONG TERM SUPPORT.

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:07.972
AND THE THE PROBLEM WITH

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.340
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WAS AFTER A

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:11.175
PERIOD OF MONTHS THE TIME WAS UP

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:12.743

INTEGRATED CARE THAT IT'S NOT

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:23.747
JUST IMPROVES PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:24.815

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:37.928
WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.063
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:41.065
COMMITTEES ANALYSIS --

00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:42.566

WE'RE SEEKING TO IMPROVE ACCESS

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:45.636
AND QUALITY OF CARE SO THAT WE

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:46.971
CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:48.339

HOW TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:54.011
AND THEN HOW DO WE SUPPORT

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:55.846
SUCCESS AND SO WE ARE REALLY

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.147
TRYING TO COMMISSION IS REALLY

00:41:57.214 --> 00:41:57.681
TRYING TO BRING COUNTIES

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:58.682

THE QUESTIONS RELATED TO THAT IS

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:08.058
EMPLOYMENT.

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.393

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:39.309
PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC SECTOR

00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:41.178
PARTNERS HAS BEEN LOOKING REALLY

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:42.579
AROUND THE WORLD AND IDENTIFIED

00:44:42.646 --> 00:44:44.181
A MODEL PROGRAM OUT OF TRIESTE

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:46.016
ITALY AND SO THEY THEY TOOK A

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:47.451
DELEGATION THERE AND ACTUALLY

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.852
BROUGHT A DELEGATION.

00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:50.320
FROM ITALY TO LOS ANGELES.

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:52.256
AND WHEN THEY EXPOSED TO THESE

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:54.091
EUROPEAN MENTAL HEALTH LEADERS

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:56.693
TO THE REALITY OF SKID ROW IN LA.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.462
THERE WAS JUST A TREMENDOUS

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.297
SHOCK ON THE PART OF THESE FOLKS

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:01.732
FROM ITALY WHO SAID THAT THEY

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:03.767
HAD NEVER IN IN THEIR LIVES

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:05.069
IMAGINED.

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:06.370
THAT A PLACE LIKE CALIFORNIA

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.105
WOULD HAVE THAT LEVEL OF NEED

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:09.606
AND THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW

00:45:09.673 --> 00:45:10.340
BLATANT.

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:12.443
SORT OF YOU KNOW THE ABANDONMENT

00:45:12.509 --> 00:45:14.445
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. ONE OF THE

00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:16.213
THINGS THAT MAKES TRANSFER THE

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.282
INTERESTING AS THEY PROVIDE

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:18.816
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CARE NO

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:21.418
QUESTIONS ASKED IT'S WALK IN

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:22.853
IT'S NOT LOCKED.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.922
IT IS REALLY DRIVEN BY THE NEEDS

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:26.623
OF INDIVIDUALS AND SO LA IS

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.125
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT USING AND

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:29.493
IT TO SAY INNOVATION FUNDS AND

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.994
OTHER FUNDS.

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:32.262
HOW THEY CANDESIGN A PILOT

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:36.467
PROJECT THAT WOULD PROVIDE A --

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:38.068
DRAMATICALLY LOWER BARRIERS TO

00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:39.203
CARE.

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:40.938
AND THROUGH THAT STRATEGY BE

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:43.540
ABLE TO WRAP AROUND PEOPLE --

00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:45.008
AT THE SERVICES BASED ON THE

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.210
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS.

00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:47.444
RIGHT WHAT WHAT WE'RE HEARING

00:45:47.511 --> 00:45:48.779
THAT LOS ANGELES IS REALLY

00:45:48.846 --> 00:45:50.280
STRUGGLING WITH THIS SO MANY OF

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:51.715
THE RULES ARE FUNDING BASED.

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:54.985
NOT NEED BASED AND THEY WANTED

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:56.253
TO SO WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.821
PROPOSAL FROM THEM YET IT BUT IN

00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:59.389
THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THEY

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.225
THAT'S A PRETTY AMBITIOUS GOAL

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.926
LOOKING AT CHANGES AND HOW.

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:04.928
SERVICES ARE FUNDED SERVICES ARE

00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:06.196
MADE AVAILABLE WHO CAN PROVIDE

00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:08.599
SERVICES AND AND AGAIN IT IS A

00:46:08.665 --> 00:46:10.801
SORT OF NO QUESTIONS ASKED

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:11.802
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IF YOU NEED

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:13.036
CARE IT'S AVAILABLE.

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:14.505
REALLY TRYING TO AVOID THE

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:16.707
ALTERNATIVE SAID THAT WHICH ARE

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:18.242
EMERGENCY ROOMS IN JAILS.

00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:20.077
BUT BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW A

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:21.245
LOT BEYOND THAT.

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:22.679
AND THEN WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE --

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:24.281
OR CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:46:24.348 --> 00:46:26.116
ABOUT THE ORANGE COUNTY MODEL IS

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:27.551
THERE IS THAT THE THING CONCEPT

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:28.919
OR IS IT SOMETHING COMPLETELY

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.087
DIFFERENT FROM A DIFFERENT.

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:31.788
POINT CAN'T SO DEAD AT THE SAME

00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:33.457
GOAL BUT A DIFFERENT STRATEGY

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:35.425
ORANGE COUNTY IS IS BUILDING A

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:37.728
VERY AMBITIOUS PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:38.328
PARTNERSHIP.

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:39.496
THAT.

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:41.598
LEVERAGES THE ABILITY TO CREATE

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:43.233
FACILITIES WITH PRIVATE SECTOR

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.135
PARTNERS AND THEN YOU SERVICE

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:47.070
DOLLARS MORE EFFICIENTLY AROUND

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:47.871
FOLKS.

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.506
IT'S LESS OF A COMMUNITY BASED

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:51.275
MODEL IT'S MORE OF A HUB BASED

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:52.843
MODEL WHICH SOME FOLKS THAT SOME

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.378
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:55.512
THAT WILL BE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE.

00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:57.014
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS BECAUSE

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.115
QUITE OFTEN THESE FOLKS DON'T

00:46:58.182 --> 00:46:59.917
WANT TO COME INTO A FACILITY

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:01.418
BASED CARE --

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:02.753
BUT WAS VERY INTERESTING ABOUT

00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:04.254
ORANGE COUNTY IS THAT THEY'RE

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.489
ENGAGING ALL OF THEIR

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.124
UNIVERSITIES THEIR HOSPITALS

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.659
THEIR INSURANCE PROVIDERS THEIR

00:47:08.725 --> 00:47:10.527
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS AS

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.229
WELL AS PUBLICATION CITIES TO

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:13.764
REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO BLEND

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:14.464
DOLLARS.

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:18.936
AND AGAIN DESIGN SERVICES IN AND

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.637
LORING THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:22.239
REGARDLESS OF THE PAYER IS SO

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:23.540
THAT I THINK YOU'LL YOU'LL HEAR

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:24.975
CERTAINLY SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:25.809
ALSO.

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:26.677
TRYING TO START WITH THIS

00:47:26.743 --> 00:47:28.378
PREMISE THAT THE COUNTY REALLY

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:29.746
NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR

00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:31.114
HEALTH OF ALL RESIDENTS.

00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:33.383
NOT BASED NOT BY FOR KATE BASED

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:36.453
ON WHICH FUNDING YOU'RE ELIGIBLE

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.688
FOR AND SO ORANGE COUNTY I DON'T

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:38.956
KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT ON CAN

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.190
WE'RE ALSO PLANNING TO GO DOWN

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:41.725
AND VISIT AND THEN THERE THIS

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:43.193
AGAIN IT'S INNOVATION DOLLARS

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.361
AND SO.

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:44.995
THEY'RE PRIDED WOULD BE ON OUR

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:47.331
AGENDA LATER IN THE YEAR BUT BUT

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:48.632
WHAT WE WHAT WE REALLY

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:49.666
APPRECIATE IS THAT THESE

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.401
COUNTIES ARE REALLY TRYING TO

00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:52.936
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING AT

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:54.171
THAT SYSTEMS LEVEL.

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:56.206
AND LEVERAGE AND TO SAY DOLLARS

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.774
TO RETHINK WHAT SOME OF THOSE

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.476
BARRIERS ARE NOT NOT TRYING TO

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:01.211
SIMPLY TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO A

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:02.879
PROGRAM THAT REDESIGN THE

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:04.047
PROGRAM BASED ON WHAT'S

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:05.415
HAPPENING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:08.051
AND AGAIN VERY MUCH DRIVEN BY

00:48:08.118 --> 00:48:09.620
THE NEEDS OF HOMELESS MENTALLY

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:11.255
ILL FOLKS THAT WERE IN THE SANTA

00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:12.155
ANA RIVER VALLEY.

00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:13.523
THE PART THAT'S CONFUSING MILLER

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.858
BUT IS IS --

00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:16.426
HOW ARE YOU ACCESSING THOSE

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:18.662
FOLKS BECAUSE YOU KNOW A EVEN IN

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:19.863
MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE FOLKS IN

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.164
THE RIVER BED --

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:23.166
HOW IS IT THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:25.402
ACCESSING IN THE POPULATION THAT

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.037
YOU NEED TO SERVE --

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:28.505
AND THAT'S I THINK WHAT A

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:30.274
CRITICAL COMPONENT IN MY OPINION

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.608
BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T GET TO FOLKS

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.510
THEN HOW CAN WE TREAT THEM AND

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.178
SO WHAT IS THEIR SOLUTION TO

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:35.646
THAT YEAH.

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:36.580
WELL I MEAN I'M FORCE I DON'T

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:38.548
KNOW THESE THE PARTICULAR ANSWER

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:39.716
FOR THAT PARTICULAR COUNTIES BUT

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:40.717
I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHAT WE'VE

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.619
SEEN IN IN TERMS OF A COUNTIES

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:44.288
ARE DOING --

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:46.356
WE IN A LOS ANGELES HAS ACTUALLY

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:47.724
EQUIPPED MOBILE VANS WITH TELE

00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:48.792
PSYCHIATRY WHERE THEY ARE

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:50.060
MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:51.428
WHETHER IT'S UNDER THE BRIDGE

00:48:51.495 --> 00:48:52.963
UNDER A TREE ON THE RIVER BAD.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.031
AND THEY'RE BRINGING CARE TO

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:56.533
PEOPLE RIGHT NOT ASKING THEM TO

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.268
YOU KNOW HEY YOU KNOW LET'S GET

00:48:58.335 --> 00:48:58.869
IN THE VAN A LET'S GO TO THE

00:48:58.935 --> 00:48:59.936
HOSPITAL THAT'S RIGHT.

00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:06.710
THERE WITH THEIR AND WHAT IS NOW

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:07.311
THE OF THE INDIVIDUAL THEY'RE

00:49:07.377 --> 00:49:09.713
TRYING TO SIR TO THEY CAN BEGIN

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.715
TO TAILOR SERVICES TO THE EXTENT

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:12.883
THAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE AND

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:14.217
AND HIS OTHER CONSTRAINTS.

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:15.452
AROUND THE REALITY THAT THAT

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:18.322
PERSON IS FACING USING PEERS YOU

00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:19.523
KNOW USING.

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:20.957
AGAIN TELL US PSYCHIATRY SO

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:21.858
THERE'S A PSYCHIATRIST ON THE

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:24.061
OTHER END OF THE OF THE YOU KNOW

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:25.862
VIDEO CONFERENCE FROM WHICH IS

00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:26.897
IN THE VAN.

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:27.898
RIGHT AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:29.833
TRYING TO ACTUALLY DO A BETTER

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.301
JOB OF MOBILE TO A BETTER JOB OF

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:33.570
OUT REACH ENGAGING PEERS TO DO

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:34.838
OUT REACH FORMALLY HOMELESS

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:36.340
PEOPLE TO WORK WITH CURRENTLY

00:49:36.406 --> 00:49:37.574
HOMELESS PEOPLE.

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:39.676
SO THERE SO I I THINK.

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:41.978
WE HAVE WE'RE JUST BEGINNING TO

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:44.314
TRY TO TAP INTO THIS LIST OF

00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:45.749
PROGRAMS THAT COUNTIES ARE

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.384
PURSUING SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND.

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:48.819
THE RANGE OF WAYS IN WHICH

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:50.721
COUNTIES ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:51.254
PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONICALLY

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:53.190
HOMELESS WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:55.525
EXCITED BECAUSE WE WE WE DO SEE

00:49:55.592 --> 00:49:57.260
LITTLE POCKETS OF INNOVATION AND

00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:58.295
EXCELLENCE.

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.429
PART OF THE CHALLENGES THOSE

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:00.997
POCKETS DON'T BECOME STANDARD

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:02.432
PRACTICE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:04.167
TRYING TO SOLVE WE'RE NOT AS

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:05.402
GOOD AT FIGURING OUT WHAT THE

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:07.204
RIGHT SOLUTION IS WHAT WE SEE

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.839
THE OPPORTUNITY TO IS TO TAKE

00:50:08.905 --> 00:50:09.072
THOSE.

00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:10.107
AT THAT.

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:13.043
POINT OF EXCELLENCE AND MAKE

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:13.977
THEM STANDARD PRACTICE.

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.312
THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:15.946
APPRECIATE THAT BUT A PART OF IT

00:50:16.012 --> 00:50:17.547
I THINK AND I'M SURE YOU'LL TO

00:50:17.614 --> 00:50:18.515
DISCUSS THAT BUT IS.

00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:20.350
SOME OF THESE GOOD WHAT IS IT

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:22.185
GOOD PRACTICES ARE NOT BEING --

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:23.587
SPREAD OUT TO THE REST OF THE

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:24.755
THE CAN WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT

00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:25.489
COUNTIES AND NONE OF THOSE

00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:26.890
COUNTY YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:27.858
EVERYBODY'S DOING SOMETHING

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:28.959
DIFFERENT AND SO.

00:50:29.025 --> 00:50:30.327
HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW WE CAN COME

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:32.729
UP WITH SOME BEST PRACTICES AND

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:33.864
I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.699
BEFORE TO WHERE WE CAN TALK TO

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.100
ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES AND AND I

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:38.769
KNOW I'VE --

00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:39.403
THAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING A GREAT

00:50:39.469 --> 00:50:42.672
JOB RELATED ONLY IN SANTA CLARA

00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:44.141
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:45.675
IS GETTING TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:47.778
YOUR EXPERTISE OR YOUR KNOWLEDGE

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:49.446
SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S SOMETHING

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:51.047
AND WHAT WE CAN WORK TOWARDS.

00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:52.983
BECAUSE IF IT'S WORKING

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:54.418
SOMEWHERE LET'S MAKE SURE THAT

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:57.220
ALL THE COME BY A COUNTIES --

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:58.989
BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE BEST

00:50:59.055 --> 00:51:00.357
PRACTICES.

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:02.592
AB ABSOLUTELY AND AND IN TERMS

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:03.927
OF HOW THE COMMISSION IS

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:06.396
OPERATING WE'RE TRYING TO FIRST.

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:08.098
SEE IF WE CAN DEVELOP A DATABASE

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:09.232
STRATEGY SO THAT WE CAN

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:10.434
UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE'S

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.569
EXCELLENT SO IT'S NOT BASED ON A

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:13.537
SITE VISIT --

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:14.938
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM A FRIEND

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:16.039
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THE

00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:17.841
ANALYSIS AND SAY YOU KNOW THAT

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:19.609
COUNTY HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:20.977
OUT HOW TO ACHIEVE SOME GOAL AT

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:21.645
A AT A?

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.246
IN ORDER TO PROCREATE COST AN

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:25.348
APPROPRIATE STRATEGY ETCETERA --

00:51:25.415 --> 00:51:26.483
BUT IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.918
COMMISSION BUT SO THAT THE

00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:29.853
COUNTIES THEMSELVES CAN EXPLORE

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.421
AND UNDERSTAND AND BILL THESE

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:33.723
NETWORKS WHAT WE FIND IS WE

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.392
DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE ANSWERS

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:36.960
THE COUNTY OFTEN DO HAVE THE

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:38.361
ANSWERS BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:40.096
FACILITATE THEIR CONNECTING TO

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:41.264
EACH OTHER.

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:42.532
WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE THEM

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.967
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:46.470
MANY COUNTIES WILL LOOK AT THE

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:48.004
THE NOTION OF ADOPTING SOME NEW

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:48.972
PROGRAM OR TRYING TO GO OVER

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:51.007
THAT LEARNING CURVE AND THERE'S

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:51.975
NO TIME THIS NO RESOURCES

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.810
THERE'S THERE'S OFTEN.

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:55.212
INSUFFICIENT TACKLE ASSISTANCE

00:51:55.278 --> 00:51:57.047
TO DO THE SUPPORT.

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:58.248
AND IN SOME INSTANCES THERE ARE

00:51:58.315 --> 00:51:59.449
QUITE.

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:01.418
CLEARLY DISINCENTIVES AND SO WE

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:04.888
WE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE TO

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:07.123
CREATE INCENTIVES FOR

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.358
PARTNERSHIP THAT OTHERWISE DON'T

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:10.494

CREATING THESE LEARNING

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:12.596
COMMUNITIES SO THAT WE HAVE A

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.030
SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED TO GET

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:15.465
BETTER OVER TIME.

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:16.933
THAT WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM WHAT

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.268
WE'VE ALWAYS DONE JUST BECAUSE

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:20.036
WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT TOWARDS

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:21.505
THOSE MODEL PROGRAMS THAT

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.973
COLLECTIVE LEARNING AND THAT AND

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:24.274
THAT CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT.

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:26.810
PART OF THAT THE MESSAGE THAT

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:27.410
WE'VE RECEIVED LOUD AND CLEAR

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:28.445
FROM COUNTIES.

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:29.946
IF WE WANT COUNTIES TO INNOVATE

00:52:30.013 --> 00:52:31.548
THE STATE ALSO NEEDS TO BE

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:33.450
RECEPTIVE TO THAT AND BE WILLING

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:35.018

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:42.058
THE STATE AS WELL.

OF THESE PROGRAMS WE'RE LEARNING

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:27.037
A LOT IN THE TWENTY FIVE

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:28.138
COUNTIES THAT OUR WHOLE PERSON

00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:30.040

AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING IN SANTA

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:33.410
CLARA WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:35.378
LOOK AT HOW DO WE CONNECT THE

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:36.580
DOTS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:37.948
FUNDING STREAMS OF THE DIFFERENT

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:40.717
EFFORTS. TO REALLY FOCUS ON

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:43.553
WHAT'S IN THE IT'S THAT HAVE

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.255
NEEDS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.756
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN

00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:48.358
WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS HE

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:49.926
WILL EXPERIENCE THAT IN YOUR

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:51.261
DISTRICTS WE CERTAINLY

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:52.829
EXPERIENCE IN OUR COUNTY ALL THE

00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:54.798
COUNTIES ARE EXPERIENCING THIS.

00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:56.299
I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:57.968
ABOUT HOUSING AND DIFFERENT

00:53:58.034 --> 00:53:59.836
TYPES OF HOUSING --

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:02.038
WE ARE FOCUSED IN SANTA CLARA

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:03.340
AND WERE I THINK WE'RE PRETTY

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:04.541
OUT FRONT WE PUT A LOT OF

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:06.343
INVESTMENT FROM THE COUNTY AND

00:54:06.409 --> 00:54:08.612
WE ALSO HAVE A BOND --

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:10.614
MEASURE THAT THE THE COMMUNITY

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.048
SUPPORTED SO WE HAVE A BILLION

00:54:12.115 --> 00:54:13.149
DOLLARS.

00:54:13.216 --> 00:54:14.985
AND SILICON VALLEY TO TRY TO

00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:16.319
STAND UP HOUSING --

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:17.921
SO THAT'S VERY WONDERFUL THAT WE

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:20.090
HAVE IT BUT WORLD WE HAVE A VERY

00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:22.058
STRATEGIC PLAN AND WHAT WE'RE

00:54:22.125 --> 00:54:23.994
LOOKING AT IS HOW DO WE GET

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.096
SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE.

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:27.998
INTO STABLE HOUSING WITH

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:29.099
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:31.267
SERVICES AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:54:31.334 --> 00:54:33.870
CRITICAL A JOHN SHARON IN LA ALL

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:34.704
OF THE DIRECTORS THAT WE'RE

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:35.839
TRYING TO DO THESE NEW AND

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.073
INNOVATIVE THINGS.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.575
THE REALITY IS IF WE GET

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:40.777
SOMEBODY HOUSED FOR MANY OF THE

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:42.379
SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL THEY'RE

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:45.181
GOING TO NEED ONGOING SERVICES

00:54:45.248 --> 00:54:47.550
SO WE FACTORED IN FIFTEEN

00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:49.152
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PORT.

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:51.621
FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IN PERMANENT

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.356
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THAT'S

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:54.324
OUR BUDGET THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.625
LOOKING AT SO IF WE HAVE

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.060
SOMEBODY IN A HIGH INTENSITY

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:57.994
PROGRAM.

00:54:58.061 --> 00:54:59.629
AND WE HOUSE THEM AND THEY'RE

00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:01.598
DOING VERY WELL WE WANT TO BE

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:03.633
ABLE TO STOP THEM DOWN TO PSH

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.201
PERMANENTS PART OF HOUSING SO

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:07.437
THAT THEY CAN REMAIN STABLE THE

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:08.138
HOUSE STE.

00:55:08.204 --> 00:55:09.773
AND REMAIN IN THE COMMUNITY WHEN

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.708
YOU TALK ABOUT OUT REACH I THINK

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:13.443
ALL OF US HAVE MANY DIFFERENT

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.311
OUT REACH PROGRAMS --

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.813
I AND I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.214
WHAT'S GOING ON IN LA AND THE

00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:19.349
OTHER BIG COUNTIES THAT ARE

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:20.450
TRYING TO DO THIS.

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:23.653
IN OUR COUNTY WE DO HAVE A REACH

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.355
TEAM [inaudible]

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:28.625
A BIG THAT IS THE VALLEY

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:31.594
HOMELESS CLINIC AND ITS POSITION

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.329

AND SERVE PEOPLE THERE WE ALSO

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:41.805
ARE HOUSING THAT GROUP IN IN A

00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:44.474
PARTICULAR OFFICE SPACE NEAR

HOUSING FACILITY.

00:55:48.411 --> 00:55:49.479
SO THAT.

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:50.980
RECENTLY HOUSE PEOPLE WILL BE

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.515
ABLE TO RECEIVE ABOUT LEVEL OF

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:54.150
CARE -- I

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:56.386
THINK FOR MANY OF THE COUNTIES

00:55:56.453 --> 00:55:58.054
THERE IS A LOT OF CHALLENGE IN

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:00.156
TERMS OF THE THE COST OF

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:01.658
BUILDING SOMETHING.

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:03.326
THERE'S ALSO IN MANY COUNTIES

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:05.628
IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.430
TO DO A LOT OF COMMUNICATION SO

00:56:07.497 --> 00:56:08.798
THAT PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.166
HOUSING PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:11.401
MENTAL ILLNESS AND THAT'S AN

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:13.136
ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE THE

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:13.737
COUNTY SMALL COUNTIES MIDDLE

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:14.604

THE OTHER THING I WANT TO

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.540
EMPHASIZE TO ALL OF YOU IN SANTA

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:21.111

HOMELESSNESS AND LET ME GIVE YOU

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.115

00:56:31.855 --> 00:56:34.057
INDIVIDUALS IN TWO YEARS THAT'S

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:35.458
VERY SIGNIFICANT.

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:39.395
WE ARE NOW HOUSING A HUNDRED AND

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:40.363
FIFTY PEOPLE PER MONTH.

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:42.365
HOWEVER WERE SEEN AN ADDITIONAL

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:43.867
THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE PER MONTH

00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:45.568
WHO ARE NOW HOMELESS.

00:56:45.635 --> 00:56:48.838
SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT CAN WE

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:50.173
DO WITH OUR SAFETY NET PARTNERS

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.541
IN THE COUNTY.

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:53.276
I WANT TO BE HONEST ALL OF YOU

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:56.112
I'M SURE ARE AWARE THAT THERE IS --

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:58.348
INCOME INEQUALITY WE ALSO HAVE A

00:56:58.414 --> 00:56:59.916
LOT OF SOCIAL INEQUITIES WE

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:02.018
CANNOT TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.386
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THOSE

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:04.254
THINGS.

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.357
SO WE ARE FOCUSED RIGHT NOW ON

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:10.160
HOW DO WE PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:11.528
DROPPING OFF THE CLIFF.

00:57:11.594 --> 00:57:12.595
MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ONE PAYCHECK

00:57:12.662 --> 00:57:15.932
AWAY WHO LIVE IN APARTMENT WITH

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:17.734
FIFTEEN FAMILY MEMBERS SO HOW

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:20.436
CAN WE PROVIDE THEM WITH FUNDING

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:22.138
TO KEEP THEM HOUSED.

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:24.541
AND PREVENT THE ONGOING INCREASE

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:26.309
THAT WERE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:28.144
AND MANY OF THE COUNTIES.

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:30.046
EVEN WITH THE HOUSING EFFORT SO

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:31.347
I THINK THAT.

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:32.882
IN FAIRNESS TO THE WORK THAT'S

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:34.484
UNDER WAY AND IN IN TERMS OF

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:37.253
YOUR LEARNING REALLY LOOKING AT

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.788
PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:41.024
PROVIDING HOUSING AND PROVIDING

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:42.992
ONGOING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:45.261
HOUSING SERVICES WE BELIEVE IS

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:46.162
THE WAY TO GO.

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:49.365
IT'S A BEST PRACTICE AND WE'VE

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:50.667
PULLED TOGETHER MANY COUNTY

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:52.001
PARTNERS AND MANY COUNTY

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:53.770
DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE SERVING

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:56.239
SAFETY NET PEOPLE SAYING OKAY

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:57.941
LET'S LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUALS

00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:59.676
THAT MIGHT BE AT RISK OF

00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:01.811
HOMELESSNESS WHAT CAN WE PROVIDE

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:03.213
TO THEM TO KEEP THEM STABLE

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:03.947
HOUSE.

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.782
SO THERE ARE MANY MANY DIFFERENT

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:08.618
PRONGS TO THE WORK --

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:10.019
I THINK THE OTHER THING I WOULD

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:11.221
SAY THAT.

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:13.523
THERE ARE MANY MANY SOLUTIONS

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.858
AND STRATEGIES AS YOU WERE

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.226
SPEAKING IN THE DIFFERENT

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:18.094
COUNTIES AND I KNOW THAT TOBY IN

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.996

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:28.771
FUNDING.

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:30.907
SO HOW CAN WE SUPPORT ONE

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:32.742
ANOTHER AND MAYBE SKILL THINGS

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.811
DOWN FOR THE SMALLER COUNTIES

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.446

IN THE LARGER COUNTIES WITH MORE

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:38.915

FORTHCOMING DETAILS --

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:55.291
REGARDING THE WHOLE PERSON CARE

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:57.126
PILOT PROGRAM IN TERMS OF HOW IT

00:59:57.193 --> 00:59:57.727

FUNDED PROGRAM.

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.903
JUST WITH REGARD TO SUCH DETAILS

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:10.273
AS THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS --

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.841
THE WHATEVER LOCAL MATCH MIGHT

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:13.509
BE REQUIRED FROM COUNTIES FOR

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:15.144
THIS --

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:18.314
AUGMENTATION OF JAIL FUNDS --

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:18.948

NO PLACE LIKE HOME.

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:29.058
THANK YOU I THINK IT'S IT'S BEEN

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.827
CLEAR THAT THE FOCUS OF THE

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.595
DISCUSSION IS ON WHETHER THE

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.197
STATE HAS DONE ANY OF THE

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.765
THINKING AND PLANNING.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.000
ABOUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT A

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:40.436
COHESIVE LONG TERM PLAN. TO

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:41.838
ADDRESS THE FULL PROBLEM AS

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.806
COMPARED TO JUST THROWING A

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.908
BUNCH OF MONEY --

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:48.011
AT THE PROBLEM AND WITHOUT ANY

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:50.713
IDEA OF HOW WE'RE REALLY GOING.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.616
TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IT'S IT'S

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.284
MUCH MORE THAN JUST.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:55.885
AND ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE US

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:57.520
MONEY AND TO DATE THERE HAS TO

01:00:57.587 --> 01:00:59.355
BE MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.056
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:02.158
IMPORTANT IN OUR DISCUSSIONS IN

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.293
ADDRESSING VERY SPECIFICALLY THE

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.863
ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS AND

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.197
MENTAL ILLNESS --

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:10.133
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO HAS TALKED

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:12.435
ABOUT SPECIFIC TO LOOKING AT

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:13.803
BEST PRACTICES AND WHAT --

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:15.938
TRYING.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.673
TO USE THOSE SAME BEST PRACTICES

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.108
ANOTHER COUNTIES AS OPPOSED TO

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.476
EACH COUNTY DOING THEIR OWN

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:21.677
THING I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.513
IMPORTANT.

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:25.248
I I DO WANT.

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:26.516

SOMETHING ABOUT --

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:32.021
MATCHING FUNDS FROM COUNTIES

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.556
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE IT'S

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.224
REALLY SMALL COUNTY THAT.

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.026
ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE --

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.428
TO PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS I

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:39.762
THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU STATE

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.030
RIGHT NOW THAT THERE SOME

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.698
MATCHING FUNDS REQUIRED FOR THE

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:44.567
WHOLE PERSON --

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:46.936
PROGRAM UP POSSIBLY ASSEMBLY

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:47.904
MEMBER AT WILL IN OUR

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.572
DISCUSSIONS WITH ADMINISTRATION --

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:50.673
THEY ARE THAT THAT THERE MIGHT

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.376
BE A POSSIBILITY THAT --

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:54.410
COUNTIES WOULD --

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:56.179
WE NEED TO SUPPLY A MATCHING

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.047
FUND TO THE GENERAL FUND OF FOR

01:01:58.114 --> 01:01:59.515
THOSE PARTICULAR HOUSING

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:01.751
SERVICES THAT WILL BE FUNDED --

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:03.686
AGAIN THOSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.488
THOSE DETAILS ARE KIND OF

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.023
FORTHCOMING IN TERMS OF TO WHAT

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.424
EXTENT THAT --

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.926
HOW WOULD BE STRUCTURED IN AND I

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.060
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:12.862
BECAUSE I'M LA COUNTY SO

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:14.697

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:16.232
A LOT MORE FUN SANTA CLARA I'M

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:18.401
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE RURAL

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:19.769
COMMUNITIES --

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.337
THAT DON'T HAVE THAT FUNDING IF

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.572
YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT THAT REALLY

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.140
WOULD BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.308
IS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:27.076
THERE'S ONLY A FEW THAT HAVE THE

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:30.079
A MEAN OF THE CAPABILITY I'M --

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:32.281
ASSUMING TO BE ABLE TO MATCH

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:34.250
SOME OF THOSE FUNDS IF YOU CAN

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:35.818
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AS TO

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:36.853
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THERE WAS

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.354
NO MATCHING FUNDS OR WHERE THE

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:39.655
WHERE WHERE ARE THE MATCHING

01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:41.457

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.535
DEVELOPING THE REQUIREMENTS BUT

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.137
OUR BIG OUR MAIN INTENTION IS

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.371
THAT THIS ISN'T SUPPLANTING

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.405
MONEY THAT THE COUNTIES ARE

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:58.007

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:44.921
THE YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO APPLY

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.455
THIS --

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:47.857
DON'T WE HAVE A MODEL IN PLACE

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:49.158
FOR THE IDG COMMUNITY WHERE THE

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:50.893
SEVERELY --

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.361
AUTISTIC WERE SEVERELY

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.063
CHALLENGED INDIVIDUALS THAT WE

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.798
HOUSE ROUTE CALIFORNIA HAVE WE

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:57.099
BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS.

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.401
WHY ARE WE TRYING TO RECREATE

01:03:58.467 --> 01:03:59.635
THE WHEEL WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:00.836
THIS?

01:04:00.903 --> 01:04:03.005
THIS DYNAMIC IN PLACE.

01:04:03.072 --> 01:04:05.174
THAT ANOTHER AGENCY DOES ON A

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:07.443
REGULAR BASIS AND I MEAN IT'S

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.045
IT'S THE MODELS THERE.

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:11.247
OF SO I MEAN WHEN YOU SAY YOU

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.481
LEARNING OF WERE.

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:13.649
I THINK WE'RE WORKING WITH TWO

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:15.284
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS WE

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:16.786
ACTUALLY ARE HOUSING.

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:19.322
UP BY INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:21.023
AND FORMALLY DEVELOPMENTALLY

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:22.625
DISABLED FOR WORKING WITH THEM

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.060
TO CREATE MORE HOUSING FOR THAT

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:26.362
POPULATION SO I THINK WE HAVE

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:27.663
LEARNED SOMETHING FROM THAT

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:28.631
GROUP.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:29.999
BUT THE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.100
WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT HAVE

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.702
BEEN HOMELESS FOR LONG PERIODS

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:33.869
OF TIME.

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:37.039
THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT EASE

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:38.608
TO A HOUSING SETTING.

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.610
IN TALKING TO MANY OF THE

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:42.144
COUNTIES WERE DOING THIS WORK

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.747
QUITE HONESTLY TO ENGAGE

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.616
SOMEBODY WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:48.217
HOUSE FOR A LONG TIME THAT'S A

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.052
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. TO DRY

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.354
TO GET THEM COMFORTABLE TO GO

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.955
INTO A SPACE AND LIVE WITH

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:53.923
OTHERS.

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:56.259
MANY OF THE OUTREACH TEAM SPEND

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:57.760
SPEND A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.061
HELPING PEOPLE DO THAT SO

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:00.096
THEY'LL BE SUCCESSFUL AND

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:01.264
HOUSING.

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:02.765
SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.066
POPULATION IN THE PEOPLE THAT

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:06.102
YOU'RE DESCRIBING BUT WE'RE

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.870
TALKING ABOUT A POPULATION THAT

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.939
IS A MIX POPULATION BUT MANY OF

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:10.506
THEM.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:13.676
HAVE BEEN OUT ON THE STREET FOR

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:14.577
A LONG LONG TIME.

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:16.512
A MINI HOW ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.648
ENGAGE I WAS AT A CONFERENCE IS

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.349
LAST WEEK WILL TELL YOU THAT THE

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:21.851
SAN FRANCISCO OUT REACH TEAM WAS

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:23.986
TELLING ME THE LENGTH OF TIME IT

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:26.355
TAKES. TO REACH OUT TO

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.623
INDIVIDUALS AND REALLY GET THEM

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.225
COMFORTABLY HOUSE NO THAT'S NOT

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:30.826
TRUE FOR EVERYBODY.

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:32.028
BUT THERE'S A PART OF THIS

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.696
POPULATION WHERE THAT'S TRUE I

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.064
WOULD ARGUE THAT WE HAD THE SAME

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:36.932
ISSUE WHEN WE DEMISE THE

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.434
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THAT THEY

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:39.935
WANT TO LEAVE ALSO SO.

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:40.836
WHAT I'M SAYING IS I THINK

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:43.506
THERE'S SO MANY PARALLELS THAT?

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:45.975
ARE YOU SHOULD BE UTILIZED IN

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:47.443
THIS IN THIS --

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.578
BUILDING CAPACITY KIND OF EFFORT

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:52.782
AND HELLO THE MOST EFFICIENT IS

01:05:52.848 --> 01:05:53.783
DO WE KNOW.

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:55.551
SO I THINK WE'RE WE'RE JUST TO

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:56.519
BE CLEAR WE'RE WORKING VERY

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:59.522
CLOSELY WITH THAT POPULATION IN

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:01.357
PROVIDING HOUSING WITH THEM

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:01.657
[inaudible]

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:03.592
MISTER ROSS.

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:04.694
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON I'M

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.661
LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM AND I

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:07.396
ALSO MEDINA COUNTY WE LOOKED AT

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:09.065
CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS.

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:10.433
AS A BRICK AND MORTAR BRINGING --

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:13.736
THOSE AND ENFORCEMENT SO THAT

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.104
THEY CAN GET BACK --

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.138
PATROLLING THE STREETS THAT ARE

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:17.973
THERE RIGHT AND UNCLOG IN SOME

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.608
OF THE EMERGENCY ROOMS WERE SEEN

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:20.910
A LOT OF THOSE.

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:21.711
WITH MINERAL MENTAL HEALTH

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:23.646
ISSUES GOING STRAIGHT TO THE

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:26.082
EMERGENCY ROOM SOMETIMES SO IN

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:28.417
IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS AT THE STATE

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.086
LEVEL AND AND DIFFERENT COUNTIES.

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:32.355
IS CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS --

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:35.858
BEING AT A TOPIC OF HOW TO TREAT

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:36.726
DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:37.993
COMMUNITIES AS FAR AS A LONG

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.995
TERM SOLUTION TO IT CERTAINLY

01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:42.031
COST FACTORS ARE HERE NOW BUT IN

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:42.898
THE LONG RUN.

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:45.134
THEY COULD BENEFIT RIGHT IN OUT

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:46.102
WAY THE COST THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:48.604
TODAY SO IS CRISIS STABILIZATION

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.872
UNITS BEING SOMETHING THAT WERE

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.308
ADVOCATING FOR OR SEEN THAT

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:53.843
SPRING IS SOME RESOLVE TO THE

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:54.543
MENTAL HEALTH.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.078
YES AND YES AND MANY OF THE

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:58.647
COUNTIES IN OUR COUNTY AS WELL.

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:00.282
SO CRISIS STABILIZATION IT'S A

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:02.051
GREAT PLACE TO BRING SOMEBODY

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.219
RATHER THAN GOING TO AN

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:04.720
EMERGENCY PSYCH.

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:05.721
IN AND AND WORKING REALLY

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:07.556
CLOSELY YEAR CAN I AM VERY

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:08.090
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT YOU'RE

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:09.692
COUNTIES DOING --

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.694
IN SAMPOERNA DINO BUT ALSO

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.028
TRYING TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:14.897
WINDING UP IN JAIL BECAUSE

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:15.998
THEY'RE ON THE STREET THEY MAY

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.700
NOT NEED AN INVOLUNTARY HOLDS

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:18.768
REQUIREMENT.

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:20.536
AND SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:22.638
ARE NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WHEN

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:23.973
OFTEN THE BRING THEM TO CUSTODY

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:25.941
SO CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:27.376
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:28.210
COMMUNITY.

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:29.678
I THINK THE MAJORITY OF COUNTIES

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:30.780
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THOSE

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:33.382
SERVICES AND THE IDEAS THAT WE

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:34.283
CAN ACTUALLY FIND THAT THROUGH

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.252
MIL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH IS

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:37.019
WHAT WE USE.

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:41.791
BUT YOU CAN BRING PEOPLE THEY TO

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:43.058
GET THEM CONNECTED TO LONGER

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.094
TERM SERVICES SO YES IT'S A VERY

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:46.862
VALUABLE SERVICE.

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:47.930
WIDELY USED.

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:49.832
DOCTOR WOULD.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.234
YES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS --

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:53.969
PRESENTATION.

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:54.837
I'M CURIOUS I I REPRESENT

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:58.507
[inaudible] FOR FIVE FIVE

01:07:58.574 --> 01:07:59.975
PRETTY RURAL COUNTIES AND SO.

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.911
IS THERE THE IS THIS GOING TO BE

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:02.812
SOME THERE'LL BE SOME

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:05.381
FLEXIBILITY AROUND HOW THESE ARE

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:06.515
DONE --

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:07.550
BECAUSE NOT ALL THE COUNTIES

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:09.718
THAT I REPRESENT HAVE THE SAME

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:11.921
LEVEL OF SERVICES AND SO MY

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:13.355
CONCERN IS THAT IF.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:14.857
BUT ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.425
IS TO WORK --

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:17.526
FOR MY DISTRICT --

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:18.861
QUITE FRANKLY --

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.529
AND WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE WE

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.198
HAVE SOME LIMITED POPULATION

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.833
CENTERS THAT ARE HUGE.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.434
SO NUMBER ONE WILL THERE BE

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:27.703
OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOR RESPOND IN

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:28.938
THESE TWENTY FIVE PROJECTS FOR

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:30.105
SMALLER COMMUNITIES.

01:08:30.172 --> 01:08:31.307
I'M IN THERE WILL BUT WILL THERE

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:35.344
BE FLEXIBILITY A RECOGNIZING

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:37.179
THAT WE'RE NOT ALL THE SAME. TOO

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:39.048
MANY ANSWERS SURE SO --

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:39.915
AMERICAN WILL THE EIGHT CS SO

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:41.717
OBVIOUSLY WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:42.685
TWENTY FIVE THEY ARE EXISTING

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:44.553
WHOLE PERSON CARE I DON'T HAVE

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.821
THE FULL LIST OF WHICH COUNTIES

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:48.991
ARE YOU SO THEY'RE ALREADY

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:52.761
SMALL COUNTIES IN THOSE PROGRAMS.

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:53.863
BUT SO IT'S NOT NEW PROGRAMS --

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.431
OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:56.832
NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING WHICH

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.033
IS OBVIOUSLY A SEPARATE THING

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.201
THAT WE HEARD MR DIVERSE TALK

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:01.036
ABOUT EARLIER SO I WOULD DEFER

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:03.239
TO HIM ON ON THAT LARGER AMOUNT

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.841
OF MONEY.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:06.809
YET JUST WITH THE NO PLACE LIKE

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.244
HOME FUNDING WHICH IS FOR

FIVE THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE IN

AMONG ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.504
POPULATION WHICH IS I THINK

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.672
MAYBE ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:52.841
TOTAL OF YOU KNOW THERE ARE A

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:55.277

IT'S KIND OF A THIS VARIOUS

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:02.317
THINGS GOING ON THERE BUT IF.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.486
YOU KNOW A THIRD OF THAT GROUP

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:06.755
MAYBE HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.390
SO IT'S YOU KNOW ROUGHLY.

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.192
AROUND TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:11.393
PEOPLE --

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.661

MENTAL ILL HEALTH ISSUES AND

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:16.965
AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO TEN

01:12:17.032 --> 01:12:17.866
THOUSAND UNITS WITH THIS PROGRAM

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.401
SO BUT THOUGH THOSE A ROUGH

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:19.935
ESTIMATES I CAN'T TELL YOU

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:20.903
EXACTLY.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.638
WHO IS IT THAT IS GOING TO MAKE

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.239
THAT DETERMINATION FOR TRYING TO

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:27.009
PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO HOUSE THE

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:29.511
THE HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL?

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:30.979
WE HAVE TO FIRST KNOW WHAT THE

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:32.581
ISSUE IS WITH THE KNOW HOW BIG

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:34.349
THAT ISSUE I. TO THEN KNOW

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:35.884
WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE REALLY

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.219
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE.

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.821
SO WHO IS IT THAT MAKES THAT

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:40.923
DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:42.324
HOMELESS AND THE NUMBER OF

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.660
MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS SO THAT AS

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:45.828
YOU PUT YOUR PLAN TOGETHER YOU

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:46.695
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT.

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.497
YOU REALLY ADDRESSING IT BECAUSE

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:49.998
IF YOUR ESTIMATE IS CORRECT YOU

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:52.267
HAVE TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND WHO

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:53.635
ARE HOMELESS AND MENTALLY ILL

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:54.603
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.405
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO TEN THOUSAND

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:57.840
BUT IF THE MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS

01:12:57.906 --> 01:13:00.476
IF THE NUMBERS REALLY.

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.211
FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:03.145
THOUSAND THEN WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.780
OUT A DIFFERENT PLAN THAT

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:06.949
ENCOMPASSES MORE TO BE ABLE TO

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:08.617
TAKE CARE OF MORE CALIFORNIANS

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.219

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:11.019
ILL.

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.221
WE COULD TALK WITH THE STATE'S A

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:13.889
HOMELESS COORDINATING FINANCING

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:15.758
COUNCIL WHICH I THINK IS ALSO

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:17.159
TALKING ABOUT.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.360
GATHERING THE THE HOMELESS

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:19.695
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM

01:13:19.762 --> 01:13:20.929
FROM ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:21.964
CALIFORNIA TOGETHER HAVING A

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.298
LITTLE BIT MORE STATE WIDE VIEW

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:24.600
OF DATA --

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.468
WE WILL TALK WITH THEM ABOUT

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:29.037
WHAT INFORMATION DOES EXIST

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:30.305
SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT THANK

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.374
YOU JEFF.

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.710
MR MATHIS.

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:34.943
SO I'M.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.980
THE MR STIVERS INCENTIVE PROGRAM

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.715
I LIKE THE FACT THE YOU ADDRESS

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:41.850
THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT STAGES OF

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:42.584
HOMELESSNESS [inaudible]

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:45.587
ON BECAUSE OF THE YOU KNOW A

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:47.923
COLLEGE STUDENT WHOSE COUCH

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.857
SURFING.

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.659
THIS HOMELESS OR VETERAN WHO'S

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.895
COUCHSURFING WHO JUST GOT BACK

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.763
FROM DEPLOYMENT AS HOMELESS --

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:55.964
LIKE YOU SAID THE FAMILY THAT

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:58.400
JUST LOST THE JOB AND MAYBE

01:13:58.467 --> 01:13:59.935
THEY'RE STAYING WITH GRANDMA.

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.737
IT UNTIL THEY GET BACK ON THEIR

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:04.373
FEET THAT'S HOMELESSNESS --

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:05.607
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THAT

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:06.742
REALLY CONCERNS PEOPLE ONLY

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.410
THINK OF HOMELESSNESS WE THINK

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:10.779
OF YOU KNOW THE TENT CITIES.

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:14.783
WE THINK OF THESE THINGS AND

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:17.419
I'VE BEEN TO THEM I'VE I'VE GOT

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:19.021
OUT IN MY DISTRICT OF BEEN TONE.

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.889
AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.424
IMPORTANT WHILE WE'RE TALKING

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:24.326
ABOUT THE ISSUE IS WE HAVE TO

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.595
FACE THE FACT THAT.

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:29.298
THERE SUB CULTURES --

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:31.567
WITH HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THEIR

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:33.168
SELF AS A CULTURE.

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:35.771
AND IN EACH CAMP.

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.673
HOMELESS CAMP WITHIN ITSELF HAS

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.408
ITS OWN INDEPENDENT SUBCULTURE

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:41.410
ITS OWN INDEPENDENT ROLES.

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:43.178
HOW THEY GOVERN WHAT HAPPENS IN

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:44.379
THAT CAMP AND ALL OF THOSE

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.181
THINGS -- IN

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:47.816
IN ITS VERY TRAVEL IT'S ALMOST

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:50.652
LIKE WATCHING SURVIVOR ISLAND.

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:52.888
BE BECAUSE THE THINGS THESE

01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:54.189
PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH.

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:56.758
AND BECAUSE THEY GET SO CAUGHT

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:57.860
UP IN THAT.

01:14:57.926 --> 01:14:59.862
MENTALITY.

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:00.696
FIGURING OUT WHETHER THEY'RE

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:03.832
THEY'RE MENTALLY ILL OR JUST.

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.968
SO DOWN AND DEPRESSED THAT

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:08.136
THEY'VE FALLEN INTO THAT AND

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:09.705
THAT'S BECOME THE REALITY.

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:12.875
SO I AGREE I THINK THE HARDEST.

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:15.077
HARDEST IS FIGURING OUT.

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:17.045
WHAT THAT IS BUT QUITE FRANKLY

01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:18.146
WE DON'T HAVE?

01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:19.481
ENOUGH TEAMS OUT THERE ON THE

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:21.083
GROUND.

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.618
EVEN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.953
WITH WITH THEM OUT OF THE CAMPS.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.855
BECAUSE WE KEEP TRYING TO THROW

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.423
THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:28.724
[inaudible]

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:30.492
GONE.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:33.128
TO A TRIBAL CULTURE.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.129
THE LEARN TO DEPEND ON THE EACH

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.164
OTHER AND THEN PULL THEM OUT OF

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:39.001
THAT AND THROW THEM INTO HOME.

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:39.601
WHICH IS COMPLETELY FOREIGN TO

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:41.370
THEM.

01:15:41.436 --> 01:15:42.871
IT REMINDS ME OF READING YOU

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:44.640
KNOW PSYCHOLOGY ONE A ONE WORD

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:45.674
OF THE YOU KNOW THE FIND THE KID

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:46.975
THAT'S BEEN RAISED BY WOLVES OR

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.110
SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:49.678
SIGNAL THE IDYLLWILD THROWN INTO

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:50.712
A HOUSE.

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:52.981
THE EXPECTING THEM TO FUNCTION

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.249
LIKE WE THINK EVERYBODY ELSE IN

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.817
SOCIETY SHOULD FUNCTION AND

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:57.986
THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:58.887
OVERNIGHT.

01:15:58.954 --> 01:16:00.989
IN A I THINK THE STATE'S FAILING

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.525
ON THAT IN BETWEEN PIECE.

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.027
BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE DIFFERENT

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:06.628
FOLKS OUT THERE.

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:08.530
THAT ARE ON DRUGS THERE ON

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:10.532
EVERYTHING ELSE SO YOU HAVE THAT

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.000
ELEMENT MIXED IN WITH THE MENTAL

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.402
HEALTH ELEMENT.

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:14.436
MIXED IN WITH THE FACT THAT

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:15.604
THAT'S THE WAY A LOT OF THESE

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.407
PEOPLE BEEN LIVING FOR DECADES.

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.474
AND AND THAT'S WHAT THEY KNOW

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:22.144
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM SAFE.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.478
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THERE THAT

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:26.882
THAT IS COMFORTABLE TO THEM.

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:28.483
AND IT'S SCARY AND IT'S TRAGIC

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:30.052
BECAUSE WE THINK OH MY GOD HOW

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:32.888
CAN HOW CAN THAT BE OKAY HOW CAN

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:35.223
THAT KIND OF SITUATION.

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:36.925
MAKE THEM FEEL SAFE BUT THAT'S

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:38.727
US SITTING UP HERE ON A DíAS OR

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:40.329
UP IN AN IVORY TOWER.

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:42.564
LOOKING DOWN ON ALL MY GOD HOW

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:43.832
HOW DO THEY DO THAT [inaudible]

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:46.168
VOIGTS.

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:48.670
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TEAMS.

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:49.805
OUT THERE IN THE FIELD AND I

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:51.206
HAVE AN OF FUNDING.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:52.407
GOING OF THOSE TEAMS ONLY A

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:53.875
HANDFUL.

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:56.111
OF YOUTH CRISIS TEAMS GOING OUT

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:57.145
AND TRYING TO PLUCK THE YOUTH

01:16:57.212 --> 01:16:58.180
THAT OF THESE CAMPS THEY ARE

01:16:58.246 --> 01:16:59.681
TEENAGERS THAT ARE FALLING INTO

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:00.449
THIS.

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:01.750
BECAUSE I GOT A FIGHT WITH MOM

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:03.852
AND DAD GOT KICKED OUT OVER A

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:07.189
DRUG USE ISSUE.

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:09.157
AND I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN WE'VE

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:10.225
GOT TO BREAK THE CYCLE AND GET

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:11.893
OUT THERE TO THESE PEOPLE WHO WE

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.161
DON'T HAVE AN OF BOOTS ON THE

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:14.763
GROUND.

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.264
IN THESE CAMPS WERE THESE

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:18.200
COMMUNITIES ARE AT TALK WITH

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:20.068
THESE PEOPLE.

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:21.803
IN IN GETTING THE THE YOUNGER

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.438
ONES THEY'RE GOING IN THERE.

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:25.340
AND AND FOR GETTING TO EARLY A

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:26.842
FULL AMOUNT.

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:29.711
AND WE'RE STILL HYPER FOCUSED ON

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.446
WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS HOUSING.

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:32.180
I'VE GOT TO GET ALL THE ALL

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.382
THESE HOMELESS OFF THE STREET IN

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:35.250
FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:35.884
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO LIVE IN A

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:37.119
HOUSE.

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:40.589
THE THE TOTALLY LOST THAT.

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:41.056
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:42.224
INSTITUTIONALIZED ENDYMION

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.259
HOMELESS.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:47.362
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE THE YEARS.

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:48.363
TO GET THEM TO GO FROM WHERE

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:51.600
THEY'RE AT INTO SOMETHING NOW.

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.001
ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER BOUT OF

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:55.070
GOOD POINT YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:56.738
NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL HERE.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.807
VOTE THE COOKIE CUTTER PROCESS

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.008
LIKE MISTER WAS BROUGHT UP ISN'T

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:01.643
GONNA HELP EITHER.

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.078
AND WE'VE REALLY GOT TO THINK

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:05.147
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS.

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:07.482
NIGHT A EVERY CONVERSATION I

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:10.052
HEAR AND I FOR OVER THE LAST

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:11.319
FIVE YEARS.

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:13.855
IS ALL ALL MISSED THAT CUE POINT

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.824
OF OF HOW DO WE TRANSITION THEM

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:17.459
IN.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.628
THE FEELING COMFORTABLE COMING

01:18:19.694 --> 01:18:22.998
BACK INTO A MODERN SOCIETY.

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:24.232
IN INTO FUNCTIONING LIKE A

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:25.867
CITIZEN.

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:27.669
VERSUS FUNCTIONING LIKE SOMEBODY

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:30.472
LIVING IN A TRAVEL CAMP.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:31.773
ME AND I KNOW WE HAVE GROUPS OUT

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.309
THERE WE HAVE TONS OF NONPROFIT

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:34.876
GROUPS OUT THERE BUT THERE'S

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:38.413
ONLY A HANDFUL OF SO HOW ARE WE

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.381
GOING TO GET.

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:42.150
OUT TO THAT IN AN AND I ALREADY

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:43.952
KNOW FOR THE ANSWERS OKAY LET'S

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:45.187
THROW MORE MONEY AT IT.

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:46.822
BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:48.590
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO SAYS OKAY

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.158
WE'RE GONNA GO REACH OUT.

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:52.194
AND THEN STEP TWO IS AROUND THAT

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.529
WE'RE WE'RE GONNA FOR TO SOME

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:57.065
KIND OF A GROUP HOME. TWO IN AND

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.733
WORK WITH PEOPLE AND AND RE

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.203
ENTER RATE THEM BACK INTO.

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:03.805
A CULTURE AND THEN MOVE THEM

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.440
FROM THAT TO SOMETHING ELSE

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:05.740
[inaudible]

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:08.143
THAT'S THE WORD OKAY NOW THEY'RE

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.111
WORKING A JOB AT LEAST IN THE

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:11.079
SUMMER TO STATES AND NOW THEY'RE

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:12.180
OUT ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT.

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.115
BECAUSE THEY'VE LEARNED ALL

01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:15.317
THOSE SKILLS THAT THEY'VE NEEDED.

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:16.551
I MEAN YOU YOU'VE GOT A BABY

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:18.587
STEP THIS THING OUT WE CAN'T

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:19.855
JUST PLUCK SOMEBODY OUT AND GO

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:21.556
OKAY LET'S GET YOUR HAIR CUT AND

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.058
A SHOWER AND A SHAVE.

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.160
AND NOW YOU LOOK GOOD HERE SOME

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:26.495
CLOTHES GO GET A JOB.

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:29.164
BECAUSE AT WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.333
FOR DECADES AND IT'S NOT WORKING.

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:32.467
AND I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER KEY

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.536
THINGS IS WHAT WARRANT 24%

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.539
POVERTY RATE IN THE STATE.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.708
SO THE ENERGY COSTS THE HOME

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.576
CASA ALL THESE COSTS HAVE GONE

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.512
UP AND UP AND UP ENOUGH.

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:45.280
AND WE'RE NOT DOING A THING TO

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:47.182
LOWER THE COST ON FAMILIES.

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:48.483
IN THAT SOMETHING ALSO SLID INTO

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:50.385
THIS.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.020
SO -- I I I

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.288
WANT TO HEAR A PLAN THAT'S GOT

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:54.756
MORE PHASES IN IT THAT'S THAT'S

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.291
GOING TO ADDRESS THESE THINGS I

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:57.592
AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY TO

01:19:57.659 --> 01:19:58.960
GIVE THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSING.

01:19:59.027 --> 01:20:00.195
IT CAN YOU KNOW WHEN THEY PUT

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:01.329
OUT ON THE STREETS FOR A LONG

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:02.597
LONG TIME CAN BE A CHALLENGE I

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:03.665
THINK WE'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS OF

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.000
ONCE WE GET THEM IN THE HOUSING

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:06.334
AND MAINTAINING THEM THERE SO I

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:07.135
THINK THAT PART WE'VE DONE

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:08.603
PRETTY WELL.

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:09.571
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S GETTING THERE

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:10.138
AS YOU SAY A REACH TEAMS ARE

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:10.972
IMPORTANT.

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:13.041
WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NOW

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:16.411
IN THAT REGARD I THINK OUR

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:17.379
SPEAKER FROM THE COUNTIES TALKED

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:18.680
ABOUT YOU KNOW THE IMAGE AS A

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:19.681
FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO OUR

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.950
REACH TEAMS SHE CAN MAYBE TALK

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:22.884
MORE ABOUT THAT.

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:24.452
STATE LAST YEAR'S SPENT FIVE AND

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:25.887
ARE HANDED OUT FIVE HUNDRED

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:27.289
MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTINUUM'S

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:28.490
OF CARE AROUND THE STATE TO THE

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:29.991
HEAP PROGRAM THAT'S RUN BY THE

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:31.293
BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:32.527
HOUSING AGENCY.

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:33.662
AND THOSE ARE VERY FLEXIBLE

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:34.863
FUNDS BUT ONE OF THE TYPES OF

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:35.797
THINGS THAT THAT THEIR

01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:37.299
NAVIGATION TEAMS AN OUTREACH

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.466
WORKER TO KIND OF REACH THESE

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:39.734
FOLKS TO START.

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.503
BUILDING THE TRUST THAN MILK BUT

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:43.471
A LOT OF A LOT OF THOSE FUNDS

01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:47.042
AREN'T OPEN. FOR PROGRAMS THE

01:20:47.108 --> 01:20:48.610

THAT PROGRAM OF MY UNDERSTAND IS

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:53.348
THERE QUITE FLEXIBLE AND CAN BE

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:55.617
USED FOR A LARGE A NUMBER OF

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:56.484
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND I

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:57.419
BELIEVE.

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:59.354
THAT THERE'S EVEN SOME PORTION

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.422
OF THE FUNDS THAT MUST BE SET

SPEND SLIGHTLY MORE THAN NOT --

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:14.002
BUT WE DID LEAVE IT UP TO THE

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:26.781
PEOPLE ARE ARE.

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.483
VERY MUCH STRUGGLING ON A DAY TO

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:29.651
DAY BASIS --

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.653
ANNA THAT IS PART PART OF THAT

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.854
DISCUSSION OF HAVING THE SUPPORT

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:35.323
IF PART OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.957
THERE AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:36.391
BETTER.

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:38.293
I ALSO JUST WANT TO REITERATE

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:38.827
THAT INTO THE MIDDLE HOW

01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:40.028
SERVICES ACT THE LANGUAGES

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:41.763
PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AND WHILE

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.164
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.666
IMPROVE THAT RESPONSE TO

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:45.967
HOMELESSNESS.

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:46.835
THE STATE ALSO SHOULD BE

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.069
THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE PUT IN

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:49.871
PLACE A PLAN THAT IS MORE

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.072
PREVENTION BASED.

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:53.141
MANY OF THE FOLKS THAT THAT END

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.042
UP ON THE STREETS IN THE

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:55.410
COUNTIES THEY ARE VETERANS THEY

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.745
ARE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY WHO

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:58.079
HAVE DISCHARGED AND THE

01:21:58.146 --> 01:21:59.214
TRANSITION.

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.382
OUT OF THE MILITARY BACK IN THE

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:01.883
COMMUNITY IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.151
COULD BE MANY OF THESE YOUNG

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.252
PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT OF THE

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:05.287
CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THE

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:07.055
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM OR THE

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:08.390
COMING OUT OF PRISONS AND JAILS.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:09.691
WE WE NEED TO START THINKING

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:13.295
ABOUT EARLY ALERT EARLY RESPONSE

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:14.529
SYSTEMS TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.064
PEOPLE.

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:18.166
BEFORE THERE SO CHRONICALLY

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:19.734
HOMELESS THAT WE HAVE TO BEGIN

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:21.236
TO TEACH THEM HOW TO BRUSH THEIR

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:22.570
TEETH AND HOW TO GET UP IN THE

01:22:22.637 --> 01:22:23.638
MORNING AND HOW TO ENGAGE AND

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:25.607
WE'VE WE'VE HEARD MANY MANY

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.242
STORIES OF FOLKS WHO WERE NOT

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:28.777
COMFORTABLE SLEEPING UNDER A

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:29.377
ROUGH.

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:30.945
BECAUSE THEY HAVE STEPPED

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:32.047
OUTSIDE FOR SO LONG.

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:33.581
BUT QUITE OFTEN WE FIND THAT

01:22:33.648 --> 01:22:35.050
THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY WERE IN

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:37.585
SOME SORT OF A PUBLIC PROGRAM.

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:40.021
THAT THAT WAS NOT EFFECTIVE IN

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:41.723
SOME WAYS RIGHT OR THE WHERE

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:42.891
THEY'VE SORT OF FELL OFF THAT

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:43.892
SERVICE CLIFF.

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:45.160
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:47.095
MILITARY AND WE KNOW WHEN THEY

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:48.730
DISCHARGED BUT WE DON'T REACH

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:51.232
OUT TO THEM OFTEN UNTIL WE FIND

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:52.434
THEM IN THAT HOMELESS CAMP AND

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.202
SO IN ADDITION TO THINKING ABOUT

01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:56.471
HOW OUR RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS.

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:58.173
THESE TO BE ROBUST WE NEED ALSO

01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:59.507
THINK ABOUT HOW ARE PREVENTION

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:00.642
STRATEGIES.

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.344
CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:03.478
THAT WERE HAVING TO RESPOND TO

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:06.681
OVERTIME YEAH WILL THEN IN TO

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:08.650
THAT POINT I MEAN.

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:09.617
SOME OF THE DRIVES ME NUTS IN

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:11.553
THIS IS JUST COMING FROM A

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:14.055
VETERAN ADVOCACY BACKGROUND.

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:15.523
BUT WHEN OUR VETERANS GET HOME.

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:16.691
THEY GET A COUPLE BRIEFLY GET

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.293
HANDED A BOOK HERE'S YOUR

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.195
BENEFITS GOOD LUCK.

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:23.164
NOW WHAT WE DO FOR INMATES FROM

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:24.599
THE GET OUT OF JAIL.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:26.301
THE A PROBATION OFFICER THAT'S

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:28.303
GONNA CHECK UP ON ON MAKE SURE

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.704
THEY'RE TAKEN THEIR MAN IT'S

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.005
GOING OF THEIR JOB.

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:32.107
AND DOING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:33.641
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:36.378
TO BE ACTIVE IN GOOD CITIZENS

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:37.812
BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY.

01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:40.048
WHEN WE HAVE KIDS WHO GRADUATE

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:41.583
HIGH SCHOOL?

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:42.650
ENTER IT NOW OR TO WALDRON OF

01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:44.652
AGED OUT OF THE FOSTER YOUTH

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:45.920
PROGRAM.

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:48.456
THERE IS OUT THERE.

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:49.491
THEY THEY DON'T EVEN GET A BOOK

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:51.092
THEY DON'T GET NOTHING.

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:53.194
IN IN A LOT OF ON FALL INTO THE

01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:55.196
THE PARTY SCENE.

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:56.698
THEY COUNT SURF WITH FRIENDS AS

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.366
LONG AS THEY CAN.

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:00.168
UNTIL THOSE RELATIONSHIPS END UP

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:01.770
MESSED UP AND THEN THE END OF

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:02.904
OUT ON THE STREETS.

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:04.339
AND WE SEE IT TIME AND TIME

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:06.908
AGAIN AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:09.110
SYSTEMATICALLY SET UP. TO REALLY

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:11.379
CATCH THEM AND WALK THEM THROUGH --

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:13.248
TO FOLLOW THEM AFTER THAT.

01:24:13.314 --> 01:24:14.749
IN IN WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:17.185
MONEY IN HOUSING IN THESE THINGS

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:19.821
WHAT ONE A LESSONS LEARNED.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:21.456
FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH YOU

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:22.957
KNOW WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS

01:24:23.024 --> 01:24:24.959
AND AND THE TRANSFORMATION WE'RE

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:25.593
TAKING PEOPLE FROM DEVELOPMENTAL

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.628
CENTERS.

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:29.464
WORD SOMETHING LIKE.

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:30.698
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AT A BED

01:24:30.765 --> 01:24:32.801
DOWN.

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:34.269
TO YOU KNOW THEM HOUSING IN ON

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:36.104
THEMSELVES AND AND CUTTING THAT

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:38.139
DOWN TO LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND A

01:24:38.206 --> 01:24:38.673
YEAR VERSUS THREE HUNDRED

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:39.441
THOUSAND A YEAR.

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:40.542
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT

01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.710
FINANCIALLY WOULD MAKE SENSE.

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:44.045
THAT HAVING PROGRAMS THAT CAN

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:46.815
CATCH THESE GUYS AND GALS IN IN

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.650
AND WALK THEM THROUGH.

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:51.853
AND JUST STAY WITH ALL. TO MAKE

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.521
SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA.

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.356
GO INTO THAT AND IT'S REALLY

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:57.125
EASY TO TO BLUFF OR YEAH I'M

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.561

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:04.666
NOT WAIT WHAT DO YOU GOT BECAUSE

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:07.402
THESE GUYS IT'S LIKE OKAY DID

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:09.037
DID THEY GET ACCEPTED TO THERE

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:09.804
ARE THEY GOING TO COMMUNITY

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:11.339
COLLEGE TO THE GET ACCEPTED TO A

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:12.373
COLLEGE.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.709
OR THEY JUST GONNA GO WORK OR

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:15.977
ARE WE TRACKING THERE ARE WE

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:17.212
FOLLOWING THEM ARE THEY GETTING

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:18.480
INTO A CAREER TECHNICAL

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:19.714
EDUCATION.

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.449
THERE THERE'S WE GOT A HUNDRED

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:22.584
ONE PROGRAMS OUT THERE.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:25.420
BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS ON

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:26.488
BECAUSE THEY THINK YOU KNOW I'M

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.323
SO SCREWED UP NOBODY'S GONNA LET

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:29.991
ME IN ONE OF THESE.

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:30.525
BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THE

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:32.260
MENTALITY.

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:34.395
THEN HOW ARE WE GETTING THERE.

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:35.730
IN THE SAME THING WITH VETERANS

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:38.066
OF ANY THE THEY COME HOME LIKE A

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:39.167
BOOK.

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:39.968
HEY GOOD LUCK MAYBE THINGS GO

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.536
FINAL FOR FOR A LITTLE BIT A

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:43.004
HOME.

01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:44.506
AND THE HOME RELATIONSHIP

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:46.374
DYNAMIC BREAKS DOWN.

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:47.542
AND THAT'S WITH THE VETERANS

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:49.377
SUICIDE RATES GO UP TO THE

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:51.713
VOTERS HOMELESS GOES UP BECAUSE

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:53.147
A LOT OF THESE GUYS.

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:55.183
WILL GO AND THEN THE CALL ON

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:56.284
THEIR BODIES HEY MAN.

FRIEND TO GO LIVE WITH SOME

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:01.489
FAMILY FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:04.225
DOESN'T LAST FOREVER.

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:06.094
AND WE DON'T FOLLOW THESE GUYS.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.096
WE VIEW WE WE FOLLOW THESE

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:09.230
CRIMINALS.

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:10.732
THEY GET RELEASED BACK ON A

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:12.200
SOCIETY WITH PROBATION OFFICERS

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:14.068
WHO DON'T FOLLOW OUR VETERANS

01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:15.637
WILL FOLLOW OUR YOUTH.

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.772
WHO THE THE THE TWO POPULATIONS

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:18.973
WE NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.241
THE MOST WILL FOLLOW?

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:23.144
THE GUYS AGO SHE GREW UP SOCIETY

GET ALL THE TREATMENT ANY IN THE

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:24.445
WORLD.

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:27.715
THEY JUST MAKES ME SICK.

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:29.083
SOME VALID POINTS THERE --

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:30.752
MISTER MATHIS AND I AND I KNOW

01:26:30.818 --> 01:26:32.086
YOU'RE A GREAT ADVOCATE OF OUR

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:33.788
VETERANS AND I THINK THAT THE

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.657
POINTS REGARDING VETERANS IS

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:37.692
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:40.295
MR TING.

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:41.296
THE MANAGER JUST A QUICK

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.331
QUESTION FOR MR STIVERS WITH A

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:45.066
NO PLACE LIKE HOME COULD YOU

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:46.334
WALK US THROUGH HELL THE MONEY'S

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.670
BROKEN OUT HE SAID COMPETITIVELY

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:49.971
IN NON COMPETITIVELY.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.240
YES SO THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:53.007
THAT WILL BE BONDED AGAINST

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:53.675
ULTIMATELY --

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:54.943
ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY MILLION

01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:55.743
OF THAT IS FOR THE NON

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:57.645
COMPETITIVE MOUNTS BASED ON A ON

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.480
A COUNTY POINT IN TIME COUNT.

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.416
OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS.

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:03.017
AND THEN THE LARGE MAJORITY ONE

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:06.154
POINT EIGHT BILLION I THINK.

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.522
YOU CAME A LITTLE BIT LATER

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.490
AFTER I TESTIFIED BUT THERE ARE.

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:10.158
THE FOUR LARGEST COUNTIES THAT

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:12.327
HAVE EACH THAT MORE THAN 5% THE

01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:13.928
STILL STATES HOMELESS POPULATION

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.630
CAN GET IT AS A BLOCK GRANT SO

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:16.664
YOU'RE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WE

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:14.575
SURVEY IN THOSE AREAS AND IN THE

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:16.410

ON THE ONE TIME MONIES WERE THAT

01:49:53.486 --> 01:49:54.054
I THINK THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.790
THEN THEN IT SWITCHED OVER AN

01:49:56.856 --> 01:49:59.092
GOING SOMEWHERE WE'VE SPENT.

01:49:59.159 --> 01:49:59.960

ROUGHLY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION

01:50:03.096 --> 01:50:03.930
DOLLARS OF THE FOUR MILLION

01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:05.265
DOLLARS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT'S

01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:06.066
WHAT THEY'VE INVOICE THAT'S FOR

01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:08.001
IS ONE POINT SEVEN RIGHT AND THE

01:50:08.068 --> 01:50:09.336
AGAIN TOLL.

01:50:09.402 --> 01:50:10.737
BUT DISCUSSION MASTER WAS THAT

01:50:10.804 --> 01:50:12.472
SOME OF THOSE INVOICES WERE

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:14.407
BEING HELD UP WE AND WE HAVE ANY

01:50:14.474 --> 01:50:15.141
INVOICES FROM BY --

01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:16.710
LE COURTING LAST TO LAST YEAR WE

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:18.578
DID THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT THAT

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:19.846
WE HAD ON THE CONTRACT WITH WHAT

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:20.580
THE HELL THAT THERE WAS NO

01:50:20.647 --> 01:50:22.148
CONTRACT IN PLACE THAT WAS THE

01:50:22.215 --> 01:50:23.049
BIG HOLD HOLD OUT BECAUSE WE

01:50:23.116 --> 01:50:24.784
WERE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE

01:50:24.851 --> 01:50:25.552
CONTRACT WITH THEM.

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:27.454
AND THE STICKING POINTS WERE THE

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.488
THINGS LIKE THEY WERE WANTING TO

01:50:28.555 --> 01:50:30.657
BUY THE BACKUP GENERATOR AND

01:50:30.724 --> 01:50:31.891
RIGHT THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:32.692
FOR THE SYSTEM WELL WE CAN'T

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:34.327
THOSE ARE ON ALLOWABLE COSTS FOR

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:35.095
THE STATE AND BY --

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:36.730
DECIDES THE THE ALLOWABLE THE

01:50:36.796 --> 01:50:38.765
ALLOW ABILITY OF THOSE YEAH AND

01:50:38.832 --> 01:50:40.400
SO ONCE WE WORKED ALL THAT OUT

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:41.634
AND AND AND I THINK PART OF IT

01:50:41.701 --> 01:50:43.236
WAS THE DATA AS WELL SO IT WAS

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:44.637
JUST THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT

01:50:44.704 --> 01:50:46.006
AND SO OKAY SO LET ME BACK UP.

01:50:46.072 --> 01:50:47.807
SO ARE THE ALLOWED TO PURCHASE

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:49.309
GENERATORS NOW NO YOU CAN'T WITH

01:50:49.376 --> 01:50:51.344
THAT'S JUST STATE CONTRACTING

01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:52.645
GUIDELINES WE CAN'T DO THAT.

01:50:52.712 --> 01:50:56.249
OKAY SO WHO CREATED GUIDELINES

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:59.386
THE I THINK THERE WAS NEW FOR

01:50:59.452 --> 01:51:00.653
THEM YOU KNOW CONTRACTING

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:02.856
DIRECTLY THROUGH THE STATE PRIOR

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:03.923
TO CONTRACTING DIRECTLY WITH US

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:05.291
BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW FUNDING

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:06.159
SOURCE FOR THEM.

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:07.293
THEY HAD WORKED THROUGH CAL ME

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.329
SO WHICH IS THE JOINT POWERS

01:51:09.396 --> 01:51:10.530
AUTHORITY THAT THE COUNTY SAID

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:11.765
ON SO THE CONTRACTING RULES WERE

01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:12.699
A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR THEM

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:13.266
BECAUSE THEY WERE USING THE

01:51:13.333 --> 01:51:15.135
COUNTY DOLLARS VERSUS THE STATE

01:51:15.201 --> 01:51:16.236
DOLLARS AND SO --

01:51:16.302 --> 01:51:17.437
IF I THINK IT'S JUST A LEARNING

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:19.472
CURVE FOR EVERYBODY OKAY SOULS

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:20.607
WELL.

01:51:20.673 --> 01:51:23.309
I BEG TO DIFFER ON THAT BY --

01:51:23.376 --> 01:51:24.577
SO THEN.

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:26.046
SINCE IT'S SINCE WE HAVE ONGOING

THAT THE GRANTS ARE RELEASED AS

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:31.611
A REASON WHY THE FIGHT ON THIS

01:57:31.677 --> 01:57:32.745
ONE WELL I THINK IN ORDER FOR

01:57:32.812 --> 01:57:34.814
THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO CONTRACT

01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:36.282

WE'RE PURCHASING SERVICES SO.

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:42.288
IT'S NOT A PASSED THROUGH A GUY

WE CAN'T SET IT UP AS A PASS

01:57:44.457 --> 01:57:45.992

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:54.400
IS A REASON WHY IT'S NOT A GRANT.

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:54.967

DISCUSSION WE HAD LAST YEAR WHEN

02:01:28.648 --> 02:01:29.548
WHEN THE DEPARTMENT WAS HOLDING

02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:30.750

MONEY IS NOT BEING SPENT IS IN

02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:54.807

TOLD THEM THAT THIS WAS GOING TO

02:02:06.452 --> 02:02:08.287

TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT'S

02:02:22.535 --> 02:02:24.136

SO THAT THEY CAN GET MORE

02:02:26.138 --> 02:02:27.907
FUNDING TO PROVIDE MORE SERVICES

02:02:27.973 --> 02:02:29.208
RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE NOT

THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSES AND

02:03:36.542 --> 02:03:38.043
THERE'S A THERE'S MORE MONEY

02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:39.945
RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF IT SO COME

MAY ONLY HAVE SO MANY RESOURCES.

02:03:55.294 --> 02:03:57.029
BUT IT'S A GRAM MAYES BASED

02:03:57.096 --> 02:03:58.364
MODEL THIS IS TIME AND MATERIALS

02:03:58.430 --> 02:04:00.032

YOUR YOU IN THAT MODEL YOU'RE

02:04:06.038 --> 02:04:06.772
ACTUALLY --

02:04:06.839 --> 02:04:08.440
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY

02:04:08.507 --> 02:04:10.609
TO CONTINUE TO PAY THEIR THEIR

02:04:10.676 --> 02:04:12.711

IS WHAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING.

02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:23.522
THE MODEL NEEDS TO CHANGE WERE

02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:25.124
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:26.892
RESOURCE ALL OF THE MONEY TO

02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:28.761

THE YOU MANAGE IT FROM THAT

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:32.264
PERSPECTIVE BUT NOT DOLING OUT

02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:33.766
INCOME INCREMENTAL MONIES.

02:04:33.833 --> 02:04:35.301
BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY CARRY SO

02:04:35.367 --> 02:04:36.502
MUCH AT A TIME.

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:41.774
THAT'S LIMITING CAPACITY

02:04:41.841 --> 02:04:42.074
[inaudible]

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:43.542
SO -- SO SO

02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:45.644
PRIOR TO JULY FIRST COULD THEY

HAVE INVOICE YOU PARTED OUR

02:04:46.278 --> 02:04:47.012
FIRST THEY HAD TO HAVE HAD A

02:04:47.079 --> 02:04:48.414
CONTRACT IN PLACE WHICH IS WHAT

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.915
WHAT THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS

02:04:49.982 --> 02:04:52.785
HAD BEEN LAST YEAR AND THAT'S

02:04:52.852 --> 02:04:53.385
WHAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT LAST

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:54.887
YEAR.

02:04:54.954 --> 02:04:55.955
AND MR TING JUST FOR CONTEXT

02:04:56.021 --> 02:04:57.189
THAT WAS THE THE THE ARGUMENT

02:04:57.256 --> 02:04:58.357
LAST YEAR THEY WERE HOLDING UP

02:04:58.424 --> 02:04:59.959
THE CONTRACT AND IT WAS BEING

02:05:00.025 --> 02:05:01.594
HELD FOR ABOUT ALMOST A YEAR.

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.762
AND THAT'S WHERE WE GOT INTO

02:05:03.829 --> 02:05:05.164
THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION.

02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:08.300
IN IN I THINK ON IT WILL WILL

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:09.201
BOTH FOLLOW UP WITH THE

02:05:09.268 --> 02:05:10.369
CONTRACTOR AS WELL AS IF YOU

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:12.004
COULD JUST TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:13.205
IS THERE ARE THERE OTHER

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:15.474
BARRIERS TO THERE ARE EXPANDING

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:18.077
THEIR PARTICULAR MODEL --

02:05:18.143 --> 02:05:19.345
WHICH WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:20.713
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE

02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:22.314
TO MOVE YOU KNOW MOVE THE MONEY

02:05:22.381 --> 02:05:22.982
THAT'S BEEN APPROPRIATE FOR THIS%

02:05:23.048 --> 02:05:23.849
PURPOSE.

02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:25.184
AND GET IT TO THE RIGHT SERVICE

02:05:25.251 --> 02:05:26.919
PROVIDERS AND NOTHING'S COME UP

02:05:26.986 --> 02:05:28.153
TO US TO HEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN

02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:29.922
A BARRIER SO IF YOU GUYS ARE

02:05:29.989 --> 02:05:31.957
HEARING THAT I MEAN I THINK WE

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:32.558

02:05:32.625 --> 02:05:34.460
THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:36.595
DOCTOR WOULD.

02:05:36.662 --> 02:05:37.830
AND I AND I DON'T KNOW THE

02:05:37.897 --> 02:05:39.064
HISTORY ON THIS SO SO I

02:05:39.131 --> 02:05:41.233
UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONTRACTOR

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:45.571
OR THE OR THE THEY THEY WANTED --

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:47.473
BACKUP GENERATORS I GUESS AND

02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:49.074
THAT'S NOT ALLOWED BY DE TGS SO

02:05:49.141 --> 02:05:50.743
THEY MUST HAVE HAD A REASON FOR

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:52.444
WANTING THOSE OBVIOUSLY.

02:05:52.511 --> 02:05:54.179
PROBABLY AREAS WERE POWER GOES

02:05:54.246 --> 02:05:56.148
OUT IMAGE IMAGINE THAT.

02:05:56.215 --> 02:05:58.584
FIVE WIRES I THINK THAT --

02:05:58.651 --> 02:05:59.919
SO.

02:05:59.985 --> 02:06:00.719
WELL IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:06:00.786 --> 02:06:01.921
THERE THERE IS NO ABILITY TO

02:06:01.987 --> 02:06:03.923
ACTUALLY PURCHASE IS OUR ABILITY

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:06.659
TO ACTUALLY LEASE.

02:06:06.725 --> 02:06:08.260
IS THAT A D. G. S. --

02:06:08.327 --> 02:06:10.029
IMPEDIMENT COULD THEY NOT LEAST

02:06:10.095 --> 02:06:11.163
THAT EQUIPMENT SO THEY COULD

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:12.731
PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND MAKE

02:06:12.798 --> 02:06:14.066
SURE THAT IT'S AVAILABLE I MEAN

02:06:14.133 --> 02:06:15.134
WE COULD EXPLORE THAT THAT

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.802
WASN'T SOMETHING THAT I THAT I

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:19.038
KNEW OF THAT THEY ASKED TO DO BY --

02:06:19.104 --> 02:06:20.539
BUT BUT I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM

02:06:20.606 --> 02:06:21.807
AND I GUESS FOR PART OF IT IS

02:06:21.874 --> 02:06:23.108
THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND THEY'RE

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:24.777
LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION AND SUB

02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:26.278
I'M SORRY I'M NOT A GENIUS BUT

02:06:26.345 --> 02:06:27.346
YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN'T BUY

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:28.781
SOMETHING SOMETIMES YOU CAN RENT

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:30.049
IT ARE YOU CAN ONLY SET.

02:06:30.115 --> 02:06:32.151
SO IS I JUST WE'RE LOOKING FOR

02:06:32.217 --> 02:06:34.987
SOLUTIONS I MEAN THEY HAVE ASKED

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:36.422
FOR ANY OF US I ONCE WE HADN'T.

02:06:36.488 --> 02:06:39.391
BEEN BUT THEY DID ASK FOR THIS

02:06:39.458 --> 02:06:42.127
JOB AT ONE POINT AND DIDN'T ASK

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:44.396
AGAIN SO SO I'M JUST SAYING IS

02:06:44.463 --> 02:06:44.964
THERE ANOTHER IS THEIR WORK

02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.898
AROUND.

02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:48.100
KNOWING THAT TGS HAS THIS POLICY

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:49.768
CAMPFIRE.

02:06:49.835 --> 02:06:50.970
SO COULD YOU LET US KNOW ABOUT

02:06:51.036 --> 02:06:51.170
THAT.

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:52.671
OKAY THANK YOU I THINK IT'S

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:55.341
CLEAR FROM THE THE QUESTIONS

02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:57.042
FROM THE MEMBERS THAT.

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:58.744
THERE IS GREAT FRUSTRATION IN

02:06:58.811 --> 02:07:00.879
THIS REGARD.

02:07:00.946 --> 02:07:04.183
AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ME AS

02:07:04.249 --> 02:07:06.485
A NEW MEMBER HERE THAT.

02:07:06.552 --> 02:07:09.021
WHAT IS BEING SAID AND WHAT IS

02:07:09.088 --> 02:07:11.490
BEING DONE DON'T NECESSARILY

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:12.624
MATCH?

02:07:12.691 --> 02:07:14.793
THAT'S A SERIOUS CONCERN FOR ME

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.829
IS IS THE ACTING CHAIR.

02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:17.596
I THINK THAT --

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:20.265
IF WE KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

02:07:20.332 --> 02:07:21.834
SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE.

02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:23.369
AND THIRDS DISCUSSIONS WITH

02:07:23.435 --> 02:07:24.970
SOMEONE AND I KNOW THAT THERE

02:07:25.037 --> 02:07:26.305
WAS A BREAKDOWN.

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:27.840
IN IN THIS CONTRACT THE CONTRACT

02:07:27.906 --> 02:07:30.476
NEGOTIATIONS BUT AS A MISTER

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:31.744
FRAZIER NOTED.

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:35.647
WHILE THIS IS GOING ON SUICIDES

02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:39.051
CONTINUE. TO INCREASE PEOPLE ARE

02:07:39.118 --> 02:07:40.552
DYING AS A RESULT OF THIS.

02:07:40.619 --> 02:07:42.488
IF IF THERE WERE OTHERS THAT WE

02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:44.456
WERE NEGOTIATING WITH I THINK

02:07:44.523 --> 02:07:45.791
THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT BUT IF

02:07:45.858 --> 02:07:47.493
THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE WITH THE

02:07:47.559 --> 02:07:49.328
ONE PARTICULAR VENDOR.

02:07:49.395 --> 02:07:51.030
AND THE SERVICES HAVE TO BE

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:52.264
PROVIDED THAT IS OF GREAT

02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:53.966
CONCERN.

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:55.300
AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEN

02:07:55.367 --> 02:07:57.302
WE ARE FAILING.

02:07:57.369 --> 02:07:58.971
AND THAT'S WHY WE LOOK TO YOU

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:00.506
FOR THE ANSWERS IF IT'S SOMEONE

02:08:00.572 --> 02:08:02.508
ELSE WE NEED TO LOOK TO YOU TELL

02:08:02.574 --> 02:08:04.109
US WHO WE NEED TO ASK.

02:08:04.176 --> 02:08:06.545
BECAUSE THE ANSWERS DO HAVE TO

02:08:06.612 --> 02:08:09.548
BE PROVIDED IN IN IN A WAY THAT.

02:08:09.615 --> 02:08:12.084
THAT WILL ALLEVIATE THE CONCERNS

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:14.153
IT'S CLEAR TO ME.

02:08:14.219 --> 02:08:16.622
THE CONCERN STILL EXISTS I DON'T

02:08:16.688 --> 02:08:17.523
BELIEVE --

02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:19.591
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO OR SIMPLY

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:21.260
MEMBER TING.

02:08:21.326 --> 02:08:21.960
RECEIVED.

02:08:22.027 --> 02:08:25.330
AN ANSWER --

02:08:25.397 --> 02:08:30.235
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN --

02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:30.769
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FOUR

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:31.804
MILLION DOLLARS IS PUT IN

02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:33.972
SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS THERE WAS

02:08:34.039 --> 02:08:36.842
A NEED THAT WAS RECOGNIZED FOR A

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:38.310
SUICIDE HOTLINE.

02:08:38.377 --> 02:08:40.846
AND WERE THERE NEGOTIATIONS WITH

02:08:40.913 --> 02:08:44.583
ANYONE OTHER THAN DIDI HIRSCH.

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:46.418
THE IDEA WAS FOR IT WAS ALL THE

02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:48.454
SUICIDE HOTLINES HEAD COMMON AND

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:49.755
WRITTEN A LETTER TO US SAYING

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:51.457
THAT THEIR PREFERENCE WAS TO

02:08:51.523 --> 02:08:52.491
HAVE EVERYTHING CONTRACTED

02:08:52.558 --> 02:08:53.959
THROUGH DIDI HIRSCH AND INDEED

02:08:54.026 --> 02:08:55.360
THE HEARSE WITH SUB THAT THE

02:08:55.427 --> 02:08:56.762
FUNDING OUT TO THEM.

02:08:56.829 --> 02:08:59.665
SO IT IN ORDER TO FULFILL THAT

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:01.867
THE THE INTENT.

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:03.368
OF THE LEGISLATURE IN OF THE

02:09:03.435 --> 02:09:04.503
GOVERNOR --

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.472
THEN IT WAS TO PROVIDE THIS

02:09:06.538 --> 02:09:09.441
SERVICE OF SUICIDE HOTLINE A

02:09:09.508 --> 02:09:10.876
SUICIDE HOTLINE.

02:09:10.943 --> 02:09:12.845
AND IT SEEMS IN FROM YOUR ANSWER

02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:14.480
THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:17.783
GOING TO BE THROUGH DIDI HIRSCH.

02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:20.219
END OF YET SPEND FOR FOR AT

02:09:20.285 --> 02:09:22.121
LEAST ONE YEAR.

02:09:22.187 --> 02:09:24.690
THERE WAS NOTHING IN PLACE --

02:09:24.756 --> 02:09:26.125
AND WHETHER THE BREAKDOWN IS

02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:27.626
WITH DD HER SURE THE BREAKDOWN

02:09:27.693 --> 02:09:29.795
IS WITH THE STATE.

02:09:29.862 --> 02:09:31.096
IT IS THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF

02:09:31.163 --> 02:09:32.865
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE LOSING OUT

02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:34.766
ON THAT.

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:36.368
AND I THINK THAT --

02:09:36.435 --> 02:09:39.404
FROM THE QUESTIONS FROM MS RUBIO.

02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:41.673
IT IT IT AYE AYE IT SEEMS THAT

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.942
THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT IT WAS

02:09:44.009 --> 02:09:45.110
THE STATE.

02:09:45.177 --> 02:09:46.778
THAT WAS NOT MOVING THE

02:09:46.845 --> 02:09:49.214
CONTRACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS.

02:09:49.281 --> 02:09:50.883
AT A PACE THAT WOULD TAKE CARE

02:09:50.949 --> 02:09:52.117
OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MOST AT

02:09:52.184 --> 02:09:53.785

THREE SO THEN THAT THAT THIRD

02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:49.648
FOUR POINT THREE GOES INTO

02:14:49.714 --> 02:14:50.982

02:22:23.835 --> 02:22:25.103
BUT YOU HOLD HEARD FROM OTHER

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:26.905
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE ALL ARE

02:22:26.971 --> 02:22:29.007
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND IT

02:22:29.073 --> 02:22:30.508
DOES THAT EFFECT DOESN'T SEEM TO

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:31.609
PHASE.

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:32.577
THE DEPARTMENT AND SO WE'RE

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:34.412
TRYING AT LEAST FOR ME HOW CAN

02:22:34.479 --> 02:22:36.681
WE GET PAST THE RED TAPE AND GET

02:22:36.748 --> 02:22:39.317
THE MONEY. TO THE THE VENDORS SO

02:22:39.384 --> 02:22:40.285
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE MORE

02:22:40.351 --> 02:22:41.886
SERVICES I GUESS THAT'S THE

02:22:41.953 --> 02:22:43.321
OVERALL QUESTION.

02:22:43.388 --> 02:22:43.922
AND I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:22:43.988 --> 02:22:45.790
AND I GUESS I THOUGHT THAT

02:22:45.857 --> 02:22:46.691
EVERYTHING WAS LIKE OF THE

02:22:46.758 --> 02:22:48.226
CONTRACTS WERE IN PLACE AS THEY

02:22:48.293 --> 02:22:49.494
NEEDED TO BE IN PLACE AND THAT

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:50.728
THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING AS THEY

02:22:50.795 --> 02:22:52.463
SHOULD BE OPERATING SO.

02:22:52.530 --> 02:22:54.132
I THOUGHT WE RESOLVED ALL THE

02:22:54.198 --> 02:22:55.967
CONFLICTS AND ARE YOU KNOW WHAT

02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:56.935
WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH LAST

02:22:57.001 --> 02:22:58.369
YEAR BECAUSE WE HAD WORKED WITH

02:22:58.436 --> 02:22:59.637
DD HIRSCH RIGHT AFTER WE HAVE

02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:01.506
THE DISCUSSIONS AND SO I THOUGHT

02:23:01.572 --> 02:23:03.174
EVERYTHING WAS WELL AND THEN.

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:04.943
ALSO UNION AND MAYBE THAT'S MY

02:23:05.009 --> 02:23:06.778
FAULT BUT I ALSO REQUESTED AN

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:07.946
UPDATE ON THIS AND I HAVEN'T

02:23:08.012 --> 02:23:10.114
GOTTEN ANY UPGRADES SO LAST YEAR

02:23:10.181 --> 02:23:12.150
I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR UPDATES.

02:23:12.216 --> 02:23:14.018
ON WHAT WAS GOING ON AND IF YOU

02:23:14.085 --> 02:23:15.620
CAN PROVIDE THOSE TO ME I MAYBE

02:23:15.687 --> 02:23:16.621
IT'S MY FAULT.

02:23:16.688 --> 02:23:19.057
BOBBI BUT BUT I ASKED NO NO I

02:23:19.123 --> 02:23:20.792
ASKED LAST YEAR AND AS OF RIGHT

NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY UPDATES SO

02:23:22.961 --> 02:23:24.295
IF YOU'VE PROVIDED THEM MAYBE I

02:23:24.362 --> 02:23:25.630
DIDN'T I OVERLOOKED THEM OR

02:23:25.697 --> 02:23:26.664
MAYBE IT WAS THIS THE CONTRACTS

02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:28.132
ARE RUMORED TO ASKING FOR THE I

02:23:28.199 --> 02:23:28.800
THOUGHT SHOULD OFFER THE

02:23:28.866 --> 02:23:29.067
CONTRACT.

02:23:29.133 --> 02:23:29.734
BUT I'D HAVE TO GO BY AS I KNOW

02:23:29.801 --> 02:23:31.636
A LOT OF INFORMATION AND SO WHAT

02:23:31.703 --> 02:23:32.904
YOU'RE TO THE BACK PART OF THE

02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:34.505
REASON WHY I AM CONCERNED RIGHT

02:23:34.572 --> 02:23:35.673
NOW BECAUSE WHEN I ASKED LAST

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:36.007

02:23:40.211 --> 02:23:41.112
SOMEHOW.

02:23:41.179 --> 02:23:46.017
IT'S BEEN A YEAR IN THE EITHER I

02:23:46.084 --> 02:23:51.155
GOT ALSO IS AND I KNOW THAT IT'S

02:23:51.222 --> 02:23:52.290
TYPICAL OF ALL OF US TO BE

02:23:52.357 --> 02:23:53.625
REALLY REALLY BUSY.

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:54.926
BY THE IT'S IT FEELS LIKE

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:56.894
SOMETIMES OF THE DEPARTMENTS

02:23:56.961 --> 02:23:58.096
DEPEND ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

02:23:58.162 --> 02:23:59.831
AND THE SENATORS BEING BUSY SO

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:01.532
THAT WE DON'T FOLLOW UP ON THESE.

02:24:01.599 --> 02:24:02.734
AND SO THAT'S HOW I'M FEELING

02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:04.168
RIGHT NOW SO I'M GOING TO CHECK

02:24:04.235 --> 02:24:05.603

02:24:14.345 --> 02:24:16.547
CONTRACT WAS EXECUTED AND I

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:17.215

KNEW THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU

02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:30.261

02:24:34.999 --> 02:24:35.133
THEN.

02:24:35.199 --> 02:24:36.300
WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

02:24:36.367 --> 02:24:37.702
BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

02:24:37.769 --> 02:24:39.137
RAY YES THANK YOU FOR FOR CORD

02:24:39.203 --> 02:24:40.838
BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT

IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE RIGHT

NOW IT DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

02:24:59.757 --> 02:25:01.025
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO

02:25:01.092 --> 02:25:02.627
PERHAPS REVIEW THE THE TAPE OF

02:25:28.619 --> 02:25:32.723
WHY IT WOULD LONG AS IT TOOK?

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:36.594
AND WHAT THE RESPONSE IS --

02:25:36.661 --> 02:25:38.663

REASON FOR THAT.

02:25:55.980 --> 02:25:56.647
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A

02:25:56.714 --> 02:25:58.483
NEED AND IF THERE IS A NEED WE

02:25:58.549 --> 02:25:59.817

PUBLICLY AND THAT WILL ALLOW US

02:27:54.999 --> 02:27:56.033
TO GET LOTS OF INPUT AND

02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:57.168

STRATEGIC PLAN DURATION WILL

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:34.238
SUPPORT WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE A

02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:36.741
RECOMMENDATION FOR CONSIDERATION.

02:28:36.807 --> 02:28:38.042
TOO MUCH WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS

02:28:38.109 --> 02:28:39.176
AND SO WE WANT.

02:28:39.243 --> 02:28:40.845
TO SO IN THIS REGARD WERE

02:28:40.911 --> 02:28:42.647
BEHAVING AS IF WE ARE PART OF

02:28:42.713 --> 02:28:44.115
THE ADMINISTRATION TO THE EXTENT

02:28:44.181 --> 02:28:45.349
THAT THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO THE

02:28:45.416 --> 02:28:46.651
ADMINISTRATION.

02:28:46.717 --> 02:28:48.519
AND SO -- SO

02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:49.520
THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGE THAT WE

02:28:49.587 --> 02:28:50.888
HAVE TO WORK THROUGH BECAUSE THE

02:28:50.955 --> 02:28:52.290
COMMISSION IS USED TO OPERATING

02:28:52.356 --> 02:28:54.392
AS AN INDEPENDENT BODY UNDER THE

02:28:54.458 --> 02:28:56.527
ALL OF THE RULES OF THAT APPLY

02:28:56.594 --> 02:28:58.229
TO US AS A BAGLEY KEENE AGENCY

02:28:58.296 --> 02:28:59.930
RULES THAT DON'T APPLY. TO OUR

02:28:59.997 --> 02:29:02.266
COUNTERPART PUBLIC AGENCIES AND

02:29:02.333 --> 02:29:03.067
SO WE HAVE TO SORT THROUGH SOME

02:29:03.134 --> 02:29:04.635
OF THOSE ISSUES I CAN SHARE WITH

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:06.570
YOU THAT IN IN THIS EARLY DRAFT

02:29:06.637 --> 02:29:08.139
THAT OUR STAFF HAS WORKED ON WE

02:29:08.205 --> 02:29:09.307
RECOGNIZE.

02:29:09.373 --> 02:29:10.741
THAT THERE ARE.

02:29:10.808 --> 02:29:13.177
TWO FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES ONE

02:29:13.244 --> 02:29:15.046
IS THE WHAT WE MIGHT CALL

02:29:15.112 --> 02:29:16.681
EXTRADITION TRADITIONAL

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:18.049
STRATEGIC PLAN FOR SUICIDE

02:29:18.115 --> 02:29:19.750
PREVENTION AND THE OTHER PIECES

02:29:19.817 --> 02:29:21.185
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS

02:29:21.252 --> 02:29:22.953
NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT STRATEGIC

02:29:23.020 --> 02:29:24.055
PLAN AFFECTED.

02:29:24.121 --> 02:29:25.723
SO WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE

02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:27.024
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE COUNTIES

02:29:27.091 --> 02:29:28.492
HOW DO WE SUPPORT THAT.

02:29:28.559 --> 02:29:30.394
THERE WAS A TIME BACK WHEN WE

02:29:30.461 --> 02:29:31.395
HAD THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL

02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:32.630
HEALTH THAT WE HAD AN ACTIVE

02:29:32.697 --> 02:29:34.098
OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION

02:29:34.165 --> 02:29:36.000
THAT OFFICE IS NO LONGER IN THE

02:29:36.067 --> 02:29:37.201
ORG CHART.

02:29:37.268 --> 02:29:38.302
AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE A

02:29:38.369 --> 02:29:39.870
CONVERSATION WITH THAT THE

02:29:39.937 --> 02:29:41.038
ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THE

02:29:41.105 --> 02:29:43.774
LEGISLATURE ABOUT NOT JUST WHAT

02:29:43.841 --> 02:29:45.409
ARE THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.

02:29:45.476 --> 02:29:47.378
THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF

02:29:47.445 --> 02:29:50.581
SAYS TYPE OF A RELATIVE TO THE

02:29:50.648 --> 02:29:52.450
COUNTY IS VERY MUCH CONSISTENT

02:29:52.516 --> 02:29:52.983
WITH THE CONVERSATION THAT

02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:54.885
YOU'RE HAVING.

02:29:54.952 --> 02:29:57.088
I CAN TELL YOU THAT --

02:29:57.154 --> 02:29:58.756
AS I MENTIONED LAST LAST WEEK WE

02:29:58.823 --> 02:30:00.691
ARE WORKING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

02:30:00.758 --> 02:30:02.660
DATA ON SUICIDE WE ARE HEARING

02:30:02.727 --> 02:30:04.295
STORIES OF CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS

02:30:04.362 --> 02:30:05.863
KINDERGARTEN.

02:30:05.930 --> 02:30:07.531
YEAH TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE --

02:30:07.598 --> 02:30:09.333
BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:10.801
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT HAS THE HIGHEST

02:30:10.868 --> 02:30:13.671
RATE ARE OLDER WHITE MALES IN

02:30:13.738 --> 02:30:14.839
PARTICULAR IN RURAL COUNTIES IN

02:30:14.905 --> 02:30:16.173
NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE.

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:17.541
AND SO THIS IS A VERY

02:30:17.608 --> 02:30:19.043
CHALLENGING TOPIC IT'S AND IT

02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:20.711
AND IT IMPACTS DIFFERENT

02:30:20.778 --> 02:30:23.013
POPULATIONS PEOPLE ACROSS THE

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:24.515
THE LIFESPAN VERY DIFFERENTLY.

02:30:24.582 --> 02:30:25.950
AND SO -- WE

02:30:26.016 --> 02:30:26.951
WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

02:30:27.017 --> 02:30:28.519
DATA WE WANT TO BETTER

02:30:28.586 --> 02:30:30.187
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN PLACE

02:30:30.254 --> 02:30:31.589
INCLUDED WITHIN THE CAN'T THE

02:30:31.655 --> 02:30:32.923
WORK THAT THE COUNTIES ARE DOING.

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:35.259
WE'VE LOOKED AT COUNTY REVENUE

02:30:35.326 --> 02:30:37.027
EXPENDITURE REPORTS AND COUNTY

02:30:37.094 --> 02:30:39.230
AND IT TO SAY PLANS THESE PLANS

02:30:39.296 --> 02:30:40.731
AND ITS EXPENDITURE REPORTS ONLY

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:42.099
COVER PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED

02:30:42.166 --> 02:30:43.134
WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:45.603
DOLLARS WHICH IS ABOUT 25% OF

02:30:45.669 --> 02:30:46.837
THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH

02:30:46.904 --> 02:30:47.805
BUDGETING --

02:30:47.872 --> 02:30:49.607
BUT WE FOUND ABOUT FIFTY NINE

02:30:49.673 --> 02:30:51.776
PROGRAMS ACROSS TWENTY TWO

02:30:51.842 --> 02:30:53.010
COUNTIES THAT SPECIFICALLY

02:30:53.077 --> 02:30:54.311
IDENTIFY ARE IDENTIFIED A

02:30:54.378 --> 02:30:55.846
SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIES

02:30:55.913 --> 02:30:57.448
SOME COUNTIES HAVE MULTIPLE

02:30:57.515 --> 02:30:58.916
INITIATIVES THAT THEY'VE LABEL

02:30:58.983 --> 02:31:00.117
THAT SUICIDE PREVENTION.

02:31:00.184 --> 02:31:01.485
WE'VE NOT LOOK SPECIFICALLY

02:31:01.552 --> 02:31:02.586
THOSE PROGRAMS THE FIRST AT

02:31:02.653 --> 02:31:06.190
PRESTIGIOUS UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN

02:31:06.257 --> 02:31:06.657
PLACE.

02:31:06.724 --> 02:31:07.258
THE SECOND STEP IS REALLY TO

02:31:07.324 --> 02:31:09.126
UNDERSTAND OF THOSE PROGRAMS

02:31:09.193 --> 02:31:09.693
THAT ARE IN PLACE WHICH ARE

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:10.594
WORKING.

02:31:10.661 --> 02:31:11.796
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT WORKS

02:31:11.862 --> 02:31:13.531
AND SUICIDE PREVENTION WHAT

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:14.932
KINDS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:31:14.999 --> 02:31:16.033
AND SUPPORT CAN WE PROVIDE IN

02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:18.235
THIS THIS GETS CLOSER TO SOME OF

02:31:18.302 --> 02:31:19.703
THE COMMENTS EARLIER IN THE DAY?

02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:21.772
IS WHERE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONAL

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:23.174
STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES THAT

02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:24.575
ARE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE HOW

02:31:24.642 --> 02:31:26.544
CAN THE STATE HELP MOVE THE

02:31:26.610 --> 02:31:28.813
STRATEGIES TO SCALE TO TACKLE

02:31:28.879 --> 02:31:30.080
ASSISTANCE THROUGH INCENTIVES

02:31:30.147 --> 02:31:31.882
THROUGH THE DATA ANALYTICS THAT

02:31:31.949 --> 02:31:33.751
ARE SO IMPORTANT. TO UNDERSTAND

02:31:33.818 --> 02:31:34.318
HOW THE IMPACT IN DIFFERENT

02:31:34.385 --> 02:31:37.087
POPULAR SOME NEVER MATHIS

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:38.689
MENTION VETERANS FOR EXAMPLE.

02:31:38.756 --> 02:31:40.191
VERY DIFFERENT THAN WORKING IN

02:31:40.257 --> 02:31:42.226
SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH AND AND

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:42.927
WORKING ON SUICIDE TO THE

02:31:42.993 --> 02:31:43.761
SCHOOLS.

02:31:43.828 --> 02:31:46.130
WE ALSO SEE SOME CHALLENGES THAT

02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:47.565
RECENTLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS

02:31:47.631 --> 02:31:49.033
DIRECTED THE SCHOOLS TO SET OF

02:31:49.099 --> 02:31:50.801
SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANS THERE'S

02:31:50.868 --> 02:31:52.570
LEGISLATION SOME COUNTY SIR ARE

02:31:52.636 --> 02:31:53.737
ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN SAYS HAD

02:31:53.804 --> 02:31:55.239
PREVENTION PLANS AND SO HOW DO

02:31:55.306 --> 02:31:56.874
WE CONNECT THE DOTS.

02:31:56.941 --> 02:31:58.476
BETWEEN THE STATE'S PLAN THE

02:31:58.542 --> 02:32:01.111
COUNTY PLANS AND SCHOOL PLANS WE

02:32:01.178 --> 02:32:02.446
HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE

02:32:02.513 --> 02:32:04.448
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES AND AND

02:32:04.515 --> 02:32:06.784
SEARCH ENGINE SITES BECAUSE THEY

02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:07.952
OFTEN UNDERSTAND.

02:32:08.018 --> 02:32:09.453
WHO'S LOOKING FOR INFORMATION

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:10.821
AROUND TO THE SIDE AND THEY'RE

02:32:10.888 --> 02:32:12.356
TRYING TO PUSH INFORMATION OUT

02:32:12.423 --> 02:32:14.558
TO THEIR USERS AROUND TO SAY

02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:15.659
PREVENTION INCLUDING --

02:32:15.726 --> 02:32:17.394
SO THAT HOTLINE NUMBERS ARE WAYS

02:32:17.461 --> 02:32:18.796
TO ACCESS CARE --

02:32:18.863 --> 02:32:20.297
BUT WE OFTEN HAVE CLUMSY

02:32:20.364 --> 02:32:22.166
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE

02:32:22.233 --> 02:32:23.801
PRIVATE SECTOR WHO OFTEN

02:32:23.868 --> 02:32:24.902
UNDERSTANDS BETTER WHAT'S

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:26.504
HAPPENING IN TRENDS IN OUR

02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:27.972
PUBLIC SECTOR OFFICIALS WHO

02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:29.039
ACTUALLY HAVE BOOTS ON THE

02:32:29.106 --> 02:32:30.474
GROUND KINDS OF PROGRAMS.

02:32:30.541 --> 02:32:31.575
AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO

02:32:31.642 --> 02:32:33.277
DO EVEN AFTER THIS PLAN COMES

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:35.246
OUT. TO REALLY BUILD THE STRESS

02:32:35.312 --> 02:32:37.081
THAT THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

02:32:37.147 --> 02:32:38.382
TO SUPPORT SUICIDE PREVENTION IN

02:32:38.449 --> 02:32:40.317
WAYS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO

02:32:40.384 --> 02:32:41.619
DRIVE DOWN THESE NUMBERS.

02:32:41.685 --> 02:32:43.854
SUPPORT EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS

02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:45.723
AT NOT JUST THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT

02:32:45.789 --> 02:32:47.157
AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL.

02:32:47.224 --> 02:32:48.492
I'M TRYING UPON ALL OF THE

02:32:48.559 --> 02:32:51.095
RESOURCES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO

02:32:51.161 --> 02:32:52.062
OFFER.

02:32:52.129 --> 02:32:52.963
AGAIN I THINK OF YOU KNOW WE

02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:54.431
REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

02:32:54.498 --> 02:32:56.166
IN PLACE WHAT WE DO TO IMPROVE

02:32:56.233 --> 02:32:57.268
WHAT'S IN PLACE.

02:32:57.334 --> 02:32:58.702
AND HOW WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE

02:32:58.769 --> 02:33:00.804
SERVICES ARE IMPACTING DIFFERENT

02:33:00.871 --> 02:33:02.373
SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION

02:33:02.439 --> 02:33:04.308
DIFFERENTLY AND I CAN I DON'T I

02:33:04.375 --> 02:33:05.743
DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO PRESENT TO

02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:06.777
YOU TODAY BUT I CAN TELL YOU

02:33:06.844 --> 02:33:08.546
THAT WILL HAVE A DRAFT HOPEFULLY

02:33:08.612 --> 02:33:10.180
NEXT MONTH AND THEN WE LEFT.

02:33:10.247 --> 02:33:11.382
TO DISTRIBUTE THAT WIDELY AND

02:33:11.448 --> 02:33:14.752
GET GET FEEDBACK I KNOW IT --

02:33:14.818 --> 02:33:17.087
STILL WELL PUT IT TOGETHER BUT

02:33:17.154 --> 02:33:18.989
SEEN THE THE THE RATE THAT TWO

02:33:19.056 --> 02:33:20.691
HUNDRED AND 25% INCREASE WITH

02:33:20.758 --> 02:33:22.726
THE YOUNGER MEMBERS --

02:33:22.793 --> 02:33:24.428
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:33:24.495 --> 02:33:25.963
GOING TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:28.165
SAID AS FAR AS URGENCY ON THOSE

02:33:28.232 --> 02:33:29.767
I THINK LOOKING AT NOT LEAST I

02:33:29.833 --> 02:33:30.568
WILL BE --

02:33:30.634 --> 02:33:32.002
INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW WE'RE

02:33:32.069 --> 02:33:34.138
DEALING WITH THAT SPECIFIC AGE

02:33:34.204 --> 02:33:35.606
GROUP BECAUSE I THINK IT IS

02:33:35.673 --> 02:33:37.174
ALARMING WHEN YOU SEE THAT HIGH

02:33:37.241 --> 02:33:40.344
OF A PERCENTAGE MOVING FORWARD.

02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:40.945
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I COULD

02:33:41.011 --> 02:33:43.681
JUST IMAGINE NOW WHAT IT IS IN

02:33:43.747 --> 02:33:45.349
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GOING ON

02:33:45.416 --> 02:33:45.883
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND

02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:47.251
GETTING THAT VITAL RESOURCES IN

02:33:47.318 --> 02:33:48.886
FRONT OF THE MATTER EARLY.

02:33:48.953 --> 02:33:51.322
EARLY STAGE BEFORE THEY GET TO

02:33:51.388 --> 02:33:52.990
THE ONE EIGHT HUNDRED HOTLINE

02:33:53.057 --> 02:33:54.792
NUMBER AND AYE AYE THANK YOU

02:33:54.858 --> 02:33:56.093
SOME EVER AND I CAN SHARE WITH

02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:58.662
YOU THAT WERE ALSO NOT WAITING.

02:33:58.729 --> 02:34:00.297
FOR THE PLAN TO BE RELEASED EVEN

02:34:00.364 --> 02:34:01.799
IF THE ONES WERE DRAFTING THIS --

02:34:01.865 --> 02:34:03.901
WE CURRENTLY ARE WORKING WITH

02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:05.336
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND

02:34:05.402 --> 02:34:06.837
COUNTY AND SCHOOL PARTNERS TO

02:34:06.904 --> 02:34:08.005
TRY TO BUILD SOME LEARNING

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:08.939
CLIMATE IS ON SCHOOL MENTAL

02:34:09.006 --> 02:34:09.540
HEALTH.

02:34:09.607 --> 02:34:11.075
BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE RANGE WE

02:34:11.141 --> 02:34:12.810
ACTUALLY HAVE A YOUTH INNOVATION

02:34:12.876 --> 02:34:14.144
AND INITIATIVE THAT WE'RE

02:34:14.211 --> 02:34:14.878
LAUNCHING RIGHTNOW IN

02:34:14.945 --> 02:34:16.380
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BORN THIS

02:34:16.447 --> 02:34:18.182
WAY FOUNDATION AND OTHERS WITH

02:34:18.248 --> 02:34:19.116
THE INTENT OF BRINGING YOUNG

02:34:19.183 --> 02:34:20.684
PEOPLE TOGETHER IDENTIFY COURT

02:34:20.751 --> 02:34:23.153
CHALLENGES THAT THEY SEE WE

02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:23.787
DON'T KNOW THAT THIS TOPIC WILL

02:34:23.854 --> 02:34:24.421
BE.

02:34:24.488 --> 02:34:25.856
RECOGNIZING THE BROADER AT

02:34:25.923 --> 02:34:26.924
CHALLENGES FACING YOUNG PEOPLE

02:34:26.991 --> 02:34:28.092
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THIS WOULD BE

02:34:28.158 --> 02:34:29.393
ONE OF THOSE TOPICS BUT WHAT WE

02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:31.061
RUN WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

02:34:31.128 --> 02:34:33.130
DO IS DESIGN USE DRIVEN

02:34:33.197 --> 02:34:34.698
INITIATIVES.

02:34:34.765 --> 02:34:35.899
THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:36.433
PRIORITIES THAT THEY HAVE

02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:38.369
RECOGNIZED AND IN ANTICIPATION

02:34:38.435 --> 02:34:39.703
THAT SUICIDE IS ONE OF THE

02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:41.038
ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED.

02:34:41.105 --> 02:34:45.976
WHAT WE INTEND TO DO IS TO BRING

02:34:46.043 --> 02:34:47.978
TO GET USED GENERATED PROPOSALS

02:34:48.045 --> 02:34:49.179
THAT THEY COULD THEN PATCH TO

02:34:49.246 --> 02:34:50.814
THE COUNTIES FOR FUNDING THROUGH

02:34:50.881 --> 02:34:52.149
COUNTY INNOVATION DOLLARS?

02:34:52.216 --> 02:34:54.251
SO WE WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO

02:34:54.318 --> 02:34:55.719
EXERCISE THAT THE LIMITED

02:34:55.786 --> 02:34:57.221
LEVERAGE WE HAVE.

02:34:57.287 --> 02:34:59.189
TO MAKE SOME CHANGE EVEN BEFORE

02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:02.059
THIS PLAN FOR LEAST.

02:35:02.126 --> 02:35:03.661
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF A STROKE.

02:35:03.727 --> 02:35:04.962
MY APOLOGIES I HAD JUST ABOUT TO

02:35:05.029 --> 02:35:06.597

02:35:07.631 --> 02:35:09.266
ABOUT IS THE STATE'S SUICIDE

02:35:09.333 --> 02:35:09.800
PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN

02:35:09.867 --> 02:35:11.368
CORRECT.

02:35:11.435 --> 02:35:13.303
THAT WAS DUE ON JULY.

02:35:13.370 --> 02:35:14.772
ONE THAT LEGISLATION DIRECTED US

02:35:14.838 --> 02:35:15.873
TO TRY TO MEET THAT DEADLINE --

02:35:15.939 --> 02:35:17.074
TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE IF WE

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:18.208
COULDN'T MEET THAT AND SO WE

02:35:18.275 --> 02:35:19.610
COMMUNICATED TO THE COMMITTEE

02:35:19.677 --> 02:35:21.178
THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE

02:35:21.245 --> 02:35:23.080
THAT DEADLINE GIVEN THE NEED TO

02:35:23.147 --> 02:35:24.748
REALLY ENGAGE THE COUNTIES AND

02:35:24.815 --> 02:35:25.816
OTHER PARTNERS.

02:35:25.883 --> 02:35:28.886
AND SO SO THAT SO THAT'S THIS IS

02:35:28.952 --> 02:35:31.789
ALMOST AND A MARCH SO.

02:35:31.855 --> 02:35:32.856
SO YOU AND I AND I MISSED THAT.

02:35:32.923 --> 02:35:34.158
YOU EXPECT THAT WOULD

02:35:34.224 --> 02:35:35.526
POTENTIALLY WHEN.

02:35:35.592 --> 02:35:36.794
SO WE GAVE YOU IT SO THERE'S

02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:37.961
THAT HAND OUT THAT WENT AROUND

02:35:38.028 --> 02:35:39.630
THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT THE

02:35:39.697 --> 02:35:42.900
LAW WAS SIGNED IN JULY OF TWENTY

02:35:42.966 --> 02:35:44.435
SEVENTEEN AND SO WE BEGAN WORK

02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:46.036
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO DO

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:48.172
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WE'VE HELD

02:35:48.238 --> 02:35:48.772
MULTIPLE PUBLIC HEARINGS AND

02:35:48.839 --> 02:35:50.007
SITE VISITS --

02:35:50.074 --> 02:35:51.375
OUR CALENDAR SUGGESTS ON THE

02:35:51.442 --> 02:35:53.043
VERY BACK PAGE THAT WE WOULD

02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:55.713
RELEASE. EIGHT A DRAFT PLAN FOR

02:35:55.779 --> 02:35:58.882
PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN WORK

02:35:58.949 --> 02:36:00.284
BASED ON FEEDBACK THAT WE

02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:01.852
RECEIVE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

02:36:01.919 --> 02:36:03.320
AND COUNTIES AND OTHER PARTNERS

02:36:03.387 --> 02:36:05.055
WORK TO THE SUMMER TO FINE TUNE

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:06.824
THAT. FOR ADOPTION BY THE

02:36:06.890 --> 02:36:08.826
COMMISSION IN AUGUST SO YES WE

02:36:08.892 --> 02:36:10.728
ARE EIGHT A YEAR FOURTEEN MONTHS

02:36:10.794 --> 02:36:13.197
BEHIND IN IN IN IN FACT WIN OF

02:36:13.263 --> 02:36:14.765
THE LAW WAS WRITTEN WE TALKED

02:36:14.832 --> 02:36:16.600
WITH THE COMMITTEE AND SUGGESTED

02:36:16.667 --> 02:36:18.068
THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY.

02:36:18.135 --> 02:36:19.603
BUT GIVEN THE NATURE OF THIS

02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:20.704
CHALLENGE AND HOW MANY PARTNERS

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:21.939
ARE INVOLVED THAT WE DID NOT

02:36:22.005 --> 02:36:23.040
THINK WE COULD MAKE THAT

02:36:23.107 --> 02:36:24.274
DEADLINE AND SO WE ASK THE

02:36:24.341 --> 02:36:25.342
COMMITTEE TO PUT LANGUAGE AND

02:36:25.409 --> 02:36:26.577
THAT SAYS IF YOU CAN'T MAKE THE

02:36:26.643 --> 02:36:27.811
DEADLINE LET US KNOW.

02:36:27.878 --> 02:36:29.079
AND THAT WE WOULD WORK CLOSELY

02:36:29.146 --> 02:36:31.148
WITH THE COMMITTEE.

02:36:31.215 --> 02:36:31.715
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

02:36:31.782 --> 02:36:34.318
TRACKING A FEE [inaudible]

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:36.120
OKAY.

02:36:36.186 --> 02:36:38.288
THE CLASS ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION

02:36:38.355 --> 02:36:39.723
TO SOMETHING I HEARD AND BECAUSE

02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:42.059
IT JUST CAME BECAME A MINUTE AGO

02:36:42.126 --> 02:36:42.659
AND THAT WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:36:42.726 --> 02:36:43.894
FINANCE.

02:36:43.961 --> 02:36:46.663
THAT THE FUNDING FOR THE THE

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:47.931
CALL PROGRAM --

02:36:47.998 --> 02:36:50.300
ISN'T.

02:36:50.367 --> 02:36:52.269
ISN'T AVAILABLE UNTIL THE THE

02:36:52.336 --> 02:36:53.804
CALENDAR YEAR THE TOTAL CERTAIN

02:36:53.871 --> 02:36:57.674
YEARS ISN'T IS RECONCILED.

02:36:57.741 --> 02:36:59.710
IF THE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE TWO

02:36:59.777 --> 02:37:00.544
YEARS.

02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:02.079
I BELIEVE THAT WAS BUDGET BILL

02:37:02.146 --> 02:37:03.947
LANGUAGE THAT SPECIFIED THAT IT

02:37:04.014 --> 02:37:05.315
WAS AVAILABLE PARK.

02:37:05.382 --> 02:37:08.051
WHO YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT

02:37:08.118 --> 02:37:10.020
YEAR OF ENACTMENT --

02:37:10.087 --> 02:37:10.988
I HAVE TO GO BACK ON THE

02:37:11.054 --> 02:37:14.258
SPECIFIC DATES BUT IT'S FOR

02:37:14.324 --> 02:37:14.858
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN I THINK WAS

02:37:14.925 --> 02:37:15.492
AVAILABLE.

02:37:15.559 --> 02:37:18.162
FOR TELL. TWENTY NINETEEN NO SO

02:37:18.228 --> 02:37:19.797
IT WELL AS A QUESTION WAS IT

02:37:19.863 --> 02:37:21.665
THAT THAT IT'S THAT IT IT'S NOT.

02:37:21.732 --> 02:37:23.467
AVAILABLE UNTIL THE BUDGET

02:37:23.534 --> 02:37:25.636
YOU'RE HAS BEEN RECONCILED STAFF --

02:37:25.702 --> 02:37:26.703
YES THOUGH THE BUDGET ACT

02:37:26.770 --> 02:37:28.172
INCLUDED --

02:37:28.238 --> 02:37:31.575
LANGUAGE FOR TINA BELIEVE AND

02:37:31.642 --> 02:37:32.976
I'D HAVE TO GO BACK TO SEE IF IT

02:37:33.043 --> 02:37:35.312
WAS. FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:37:35.379 --> 02:37:36.146
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS WELL --

02:37:36.213 --> 02:37:38.248
AND SO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT

02:37:38.315 --> 02:37:40.417
FUNDS ARE RECONCILED IN ARREARS

02:37:40.484 --> 02:37:40.918
BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON

02:37:40.984 --> 02:37:41.985
PERSONAL INCOME TAX.

02:37:42.052 --> 02:37:43.787
AND SO AS OF RIGHT NOW OUR REC

02:37:43.854 --> 02:37:46.256
WERE FINISHING UP THE AS

02:37:46.323 --> 02:37:47.691
EVERYONE IS FILING TAXES.

02:37:47.758 --> 02:37:50.394
EITHER THE TAX YEARS CLOSING AND

02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:51.895
SO THE FINAL --

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:54.097
PERSONAL CONTACT ATTRIBUTED TO

02:37:54.164 --> 02:37:54.731
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN JUST

02:37:54.798 --> 02:37:56.800
COMPLETED IN THIS MARCH SO IS

02:37:56.867 --> 02:37:58.669
THAT PECULIAR TO IS THAT FOR ALL

02:37:58.735 --> 02:37:59.670
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT

02:37:59.736 --> 02:38:00.637
PROGRAMS.

02:38:00.704 --> 02:38:02.472
SO FOR ALL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE

02:38:02.539 --> 02:38:04.608
ACT FUNDS WE CARRY IN A COOL

02:38:04.675 --> 02:38:06.143
BOUNCE IN THERE FOR THE

02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:08.378
SUBSEQUENT AMOUNT THAT MAY BE

02:38:08.445 --> 02:38:10.013
REALIZE FOR A TAX YEAR.

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:12.382
AND THAT WAS ESTABLISHED TO A

02:38:12.449 --> 02:38:13.050
BUDGET.

02:38:13.116 --> 02:38:15.018
BUT THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL.

02:38:15.085 --> 02:38:16.987
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN SO THE OTHER

02:38:17.054 --> 02:38:18.589
PROGRAMS I GET NO NO YOU CAN'T

02:38:18.655 --> 02:38:19.790
YOU'RE QUITE EVENING ELSE IN THE

02:38:19.857 --> 02:38:21.191
STATE THE TâM OF THIS WAY?

02:38:21.258 --> 02:38:23.260
NO SO WHAT AND WHY IS WHY IS

02:38:23.327 --> 02:38:24.828
THIS THIS ONE IS SO IT WASN'T

02:38:24.895 --> 02:38:26.263
JUST THIS ONE THOUGH THERE WERE

02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:28.098
OTHER INVESTMENTS MADE IN IN THE

02:38:28.165 --> 02:38:29.833
BUDGET ACT THAT DID HAVE SIMILAR

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:33.570
LANGUAGE LIKE --

02:38:33.637 --> 02:38:34.972
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO IT REALLY I

02:38:35.038 --> 02:38:36.340
HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND I GUESS

02:38:36.406 --> 02:38:37.875
THE CONCERN THAT ONE I THOUGHT --

02:38:37.941 --> 02:38:39.910
THE REASON IS IS BECAUSE AGAIN

02:38:39.977 --> 02:38:41.545
THE VOLATILITY OF THE MENTAL YOU

02:38:41.612 --> 02:38:44.181
EVERY ACTOR JACK YOU CAN'T I

02:38:44.248 --> 02:38:45.782
MEAN WE CAN'T PROJECT.

02:38:45.849 --> 02:38:47.217
LOOK YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT

02:38:47.284 --> 02:38:47.784
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THEM I

02:38:47.851 --> 02:38:49.686
GUESS FOR ME AND GOES BACK HIS

02:38:49.753 --> 02:38:51.054
FRUSTRATION THAT WE HAVE ABOUT

02:38:51.121 --> 02:38:52.623
HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET

02:38:52.689 --> 02:38:55.926
ANYTHING DONE.

02:38:55.993 --> 02:38:57.294
IS YOU CAN'T PROJECT.

02:38:57.361 --> 02:38:57.928
WITHIN YOU CAN'T SAY WE'RE GONNA

02:38:57.995 --> 02:38:59.296
ALLOCATE 75% OF THE MONEY

02:38:59.363 --> 02:39:00.764
BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S NOT WE KNOW

02:39:00.831 --> 02:39:01.632
WE'RE NOT GOING.

02:39:01.698 --> 02:39:02.933
TO MEAN THAT MAY NOT GET IT ALL

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.868
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA SAY. 75%

02:39:04.935 --> 02:39:05.736
THAT MONIES CAN BE AVAILABLE

02:39:05.802 --> 02:39:08.438
UNTIL UNTIL IT'S RECONCILED

02:39:08.505 --> 02:39:10.641
INSTEAD WE HAVE TO WAIT A WAIT

02:39:10.707 --> 02:39:12.276
THAT ENTIRE AMOUNT OF TIME.

02:39:12.342 --> 02:39:14.111
YET I GUESS MY FROM I GUESS THE

02:39:14.177 --> 02:39:15.445
FRUSTRATION IS.

02:39:15.512 --> 02:39:17.614
THAT THE RATE OF SUICIDE IS

02:39:17.681 --> 02:39:19.483
INCREASING IT'S NOT LIKE THIS

02:39:19.549 --> 02:39:20.951
NUMBER IS GOING DOWN.

02:39:21.018 --> 02:39:24.421
AND SO ALL THESE LITTLE THANKS

02:39:24.488 --> 02:39:27.024
ALL ADD UP AND PEOPLE ARE DYING.

02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:28.725
SO I THAT'S WHY I'M CURIOUS IS

02:39:28.792 --> 02:39:30.227
LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:39:30.294 --> 02:39:33.130
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS

02:39:33.196 --> 02:39:34.665
SET UP IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY

02:39:34.731 --> 02:39:35.766
AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED THERE

02:39:35.832 --> 02:39:36.767
ANYTHING ELSE IN STATE

02:39:36.833 --> 02:39:40.003
GOVERNMENT THAT SET UP THIS WAY.

02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:41.972
WITH THE AT RISK POP WE HAD

02:39:42.039 --> 02:39:44.141
CONSIDERING THE AT RISK.

02:39:44.207 --> 02:39:45.676
POPULAR NATURE OF THE POPULATION

02:39:45.742 --> 02:39:47.177
WERE TALKING ABOUT HER ANYTHING

02:39:47.244 --> 02:39:48.245
ELSE AND STATE GOVERNMENT SET

02:39:48.312 --> 02:39:49.880
THIS WAY AND THEN.

02:39:49.947 --> 02:39:51.581
THE FOLLOW UP IS THAT WHY.

02:39:51.648 --> 02:39:54.685
I KNOW THE MECHANICS WHY WASN'T

02:39:54.751 --> 02:39:56.253
THERE ANOTHER OPTION EXPORTS OF

02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:57.321
THAT SOME OF THIS MONEY COULD BE

02:39:57.387 --> 02:39:58.755
FREED UP.

02:39:58.822 --> 02:40:00.691
AND ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD IN

02:40:00.757 --> 02:40:02.759
THIS DIRECTION SO.

02:40:02.826 --> 02:40:03.894
I COULD SAY THAT THERE WERE

02:40:03.961 --> 02:40:05.162
OTHER INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE

02:40:05.228 --> 02:40:06.396
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND THAT

02:40:06.463 --> 02:40:08.065
WERE SUBJECT TO THIS --

02:40:08.131 --> 02:40:09.733
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE I DON'T

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:10.634
KNOW I DON'T HAVE THEM IN FRONT

02:40:10.701 --> 02:40:12.002
OF ME I COULD I COULD FOLLOW UP

02:40:12.069 --> 02:40:13.537
WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND PROVIDE

02:40:13.603 --> 02:40:14.504
THOSE OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT

02:40:14.571 --> 02:40:15.872
WE'RE WE'RE SUBJECT TO THE SAME

02:40:15.939 --> 02:40:16.840
LANGUAGE.

02:40:16.907 --> 02:40:18.775
AS I I UNDERSTAND THE

02:40:18.842 --> 02:40:20.577
SENSITIVITY WITH THE THE SUICIDE

02:40:20.644 --> 02:40:22.079
HOTLINE FINING GETTING THAT OUT

02:40:22.145 --> 02:40:23.213
I DON'T THINK AT THE TIME THAT

02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:24.982
WAS CONTEMPLATION OF ALTERNATIVE

02:41:18.969 --> 02:41:20.837
METHODOLOGY TO THE THIS FUNDING

02:41:20.904 --> 02:41:23.006

SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN

02:41:52.269 --> 02:41:52.803
EIGHTEEN AND PRIOR TO THAT IT

02:41:52.869 --> 02:41:53.236
WASN'T DONE THIS WAY

02:41:53.303 --> 02:41:53.537
[inaudible]

02:41:53.603 --> 02:41:57.174
AB.

02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:58.575
AGAIN I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND

02:41:58.642 --> 02:42:00.243
SEE WHICH WHICH FUNDING

02:42:00.310 --> 02:42:03.146
ALLOCATIONS WERE SUBJECT TO THIS --

02:42:03.213 --> 02:42:05.482
I AM AWARE THAT THIS --

02:42:05.549 --> 02:42:06.917
LANGUAGE HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN

02:42:06.983 --> 02:42:08.018
PREVIOUS --

02:42:08.085 --> 02:42:09.219
INVESTMENTS FOR THIS PARTICULAR

02:42:09.286 --> 02:42:11.088
FUND.

02:42:11.154 --> 02:42:12.722
I JUST THAT JUST IT JUST FEELS

02:42:12.789 --> 02:42:13.590
LIKE THERE'S A RELUCTANCE TO

02:42:13.657 --> 02:42:14.524
SPEND THE MONEY WHERE IT NEEDS

02:42:14.591 --> 02:42:16.093
TO BE SPENT AND I'M SORRY I

02:42:16.159 --> 02:42:17.961
CAN'T COME TO ANOTHER CONCLUSION

02:42:18.028 --> 02:42:20.063
AT THIS POINT.

02:42:20.130 --> 02:42:22.399
WELL I THINK THE CORRECT SURE

02:42:22.466 --> 02:42:23.033
THE FRUSTRATION OF SOMEONE OF

02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:23.867
WOOD.

02:42:23.934 --> 02:42:25.235
WELL WE HAVE A TWENTY BILLION

02:42:25.302 --> 02:42:27.070
DOLLAR SURPLUS WE'RE TALKING

02:42:27.137 --> 02:42:28.972
ABOUT HOLDING BACK FOUR POINT

02:42:29.039 --> 02:42:30.140
THREE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:42:30.207 --> 02:42:32.008
YOU KNOW I MEAN WHAT AND THE

02:42:32.075 --> 02:42:33.143
SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT IT COULD

02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:35.312
CONCOCT WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS

02:42:35.378 --> 02:42:36.780
WHAT IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH.

02:42:36.847 --> 02:42:38.748
HAD A GUN OUT WHEN WE ONLY HAVE

02:42:38.815 --> 02:42:40.684
ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

02:42:40.750 --> 02:42:42.619
AND BILLING --

02:42:42.686 --> 02:42:43.386
HERO.

02:42:43.453 --> 02:42:45.222
WE WANT WE WANT EVERY RESOURCE

02:42:45.288 --> 02:42:47.724
UTILIZED FOR THAT MAXIMIZING THE

02:42:47.791 --> 02:42:49.659
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT.

02:42:49.726 --> 02:42:52.462
CAN GET OUT AND BE USEFUL.

02:42:52.529 --> 02:42:55.465
AND AS NOTED WITH THE RATE.

02:42:55.532 --> 02:42:57.000
SUICIDE RATE INCREASING

02:42:57.067 --> 02:42:59.369
DRAMATICALLY --

02:42:59.436 --> 02:43:00.770
HOW YOU PUT OUT HAVE A FIRE

02:43:00.837 --> 02:43:01.071
[inaudible]

02:43:01.138 --> 02:43:02.739
IT DOES.

02:43:02.806 --> 02:43:04.674
UNLESS YOU PUT PROPER RESOURCES

02:43:04.741 --> 02:43:05.976
TO IT AND I THINK THAT'S A

02:43:06.042 --> 02:43:07.444
FRUSTRATION.

02:43:07.511 --> 02:43:08.411
OUR EXPECTATION IS [inaudible]

02:43:08.478 --> 02:43:10.213
THAT.

02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:11.314
THAT THE MONEY BE UTILIZED IN

02:43:11.381 --> 02:43:12.782
EVERY [inaudible]

02:43:12.849 --> 02:43:15.852
POSSIBLE FASHION. TO BE THE MOST

02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:17.988
EFFECTIVE AND BEST VALUE.

02:43:18.054 --> 02:43:19.156
AND I THINK THAT IF IT IF YOU

02:43:19.222 --> 02:43:21.625
MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT --

02:43:21.691 --> 02:43:23.493
THAT THIS ISN'T WHAT WE'RE

02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:25.061
LOOKING AT IS A COMMITTEE --

02:43:25.128 --> 02:43:26.696
TO GET IT OUT INTO THE PUBLIC

02:43:26.763 --> 02:43:28.431
EFFECTIVELY THE WE NEED TO DO

02:43:28.498 --> 02:43:31.234
SOMETHING LEGISLATIVELY SO THAT

02:43:31.301 --> 02:43:33.103
YOU HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO SO.

02:43:33.170 --> 02:43:35.539
SO YOU NEED TO TELL US APART IS

02:43:35.605 --> 02:43:37.107
ARE YOU BEING CONSTRAINT.

02:43:37.174 --> 02:43:39.442
AS IT AS AN AGENCY.

02:43:39.509 --> 02:43:42.179
OR ARE YOU MAKING THE DECISION.

02:43:42.245 --> 02:43:42.879
BECAUSE SOMEBODY MADE THAT

02:43:42.946 --> 02:43:44.381
DECISION EITHER IT WAS A

02:43:44.447 --> 02:43:45.916
DECISION THAT WAS MADE.

02:43:45.982 --> 02:43:48.485
BASED UPON WHAT YOU THOUGHT THE

02:43:48.552 --> 02:43:50.086
LEGISLATURE WANTED OR MADE THE

02:43:50.153 --> 02:43:51.321
DECISION THAT WAS MADE BASED

02:43:51.388 --> 02:43:52.756
UPON SOMETHING THAT WAS WRITTEN

02:43:52.822 --> 02:43:57.093
IN THE LEGISLATION.

02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:00.263
THERE HAS TO BE.

02:44:00.330 --> 02:44:02.732
SOME INDEPENDENT THOUGHT WHEN WE

02:44:02.799 --> 02:44:04.768
KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:44:04.834 --> 02:44:06.269
THE GOVERNOR HAS INCLUDED THIS

02:44:06.336 --> 02:44:07.504
IN.

02:44:07.571 --> 02:44:08.305
THEY'VE INCLUDED THIS IN THE

02:44:08.371 --> 02:44:09.973
BUDGET THE INTENT FOR TO BE

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:12.442
SPENT SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A

02:44:12.509 --> 02:44:14.044
HOLD UP OF SOME KIND.

02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:15.145
I THINK.

02:44:15.212 --> 02:44:16.880
THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD LET US

02:44:16.947 --> 02:44:17.547
KNOW.

02:44:17.614 --> 02:44:18.982
THERE IS A HOLD UP THIS IS WHY

02:44:19.049 --> 02:44:21.017
THERE'S A HOLD UP AND IT NEEDS

02:44:21.084 --> 02:44:22.752
TO BE ADDRESSED.

02:44:22.819 --> 02:44:24.154
IT SHOULD NOT BE.

02:44:24.221 --> 02:44:25.889
THAT WE ARE QUESTIONING

02:44:25.956 --> 02:44:28.625
SOMETHING THEIR ARGUMENTS ABOUT

02:44:28.692 --> 02:44:30.327
IT THERE SHOULD BE NO ARGUMENT.

02:44:30.393 --> 02:44:31.394
I THINK THE INTENT OF THE

02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:33.530
LEGISLATURE WAS CLEAR THAT THEY

02:44:33.597 --> 02:44:35.165
WANTED THIS MONEY SPENT FOR A

02:44:35.232 --> 02:44:36.366
PARTICULAR REASON.

02:44:36.433 --> 02:44:38.001
AND IT WASN'T.

02:44:38.068 --> 02:44:39.402
OR WAS DELAYED.

02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:41.171
AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AND THEY SAY

02:44:41.238 --> 02:44:42.806
JUSTICE DELAYED IS DUST JUSTICE

02:44:42.872 --> 02:44:45.742
DENIED IT'S THE SAME THING HERE.

02:44:45.809 --> 02:44:48.912
AND YOU HEARD IT THE FRUSTRATION

02:44:48.979 --> 02:44:50.313
FROM MY COLLEAGUES.

02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:51.114
ALL RIGHT.

02:44:51.181 --> 02:44:51.948

GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE CHAVEZ HAD

02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:58.321
PREVENTION THAT SINCE SO --

02:45:00.824 --> 02:45:01.992
SO YOU MAY RECALL THAT THE

02:45:02.058 --> 02:45:03.893

THE WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY DO

02:45:16.973 --> 02:45:18.475

THAT THE SEVEN MILLION IN EMMA

02:45:27.851 --> 02:45:29.352
TO SAY FUNDS WAS VERY IMPORTANT

02:45:29.419 --> 02:45:30.520

WHAT THEY EXPLAINED TO US IS

02:45:34.457 --> 02:45:36.660
UNDER FEDERAL LAW THEY WERE ABLE

02:45:36.726 --> 02:45:37.794
TO ACTUALLY MATCH THAT TO DRIVE

02:45:37.861 --> 02:45:39.329
DOWN FEDERAL MONEY THAT

02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:40.864

FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT.

02:45:48.405 --> 02:45:49.739
HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL TO DRIVE

EXTEND OUT ON EACH SIDE OF THE

02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:04.421
BRIDGE.

02:46:04.487 --> 02:46:05.855
THIS IS BASED ON AN

02:46:05.922 --> 02:46:07.057
INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF

02:46:07.123 --> 02:46:08.558
STRATEGIES AROUND THE WORLD TO

02:46:08.625 --> 02:46:10.727
ACTUALLY DETER PEOPLE FROM

02:46:10.794 --> 02:46:12.195
JUMPING OFF OF OTHER HIGH

02:46:12.262 --> 02:46:13.863
STRUCTURES LIKE BRIDGES.

02:46:13.930 --> 02:46:15.098
AND THERE'S THE BRIDGE DISTRICT

02:46:15.165 --> 02:46:18.001
SHARED WITH A THEY KNOW OF WHERE

02:46:18.068 --> 02:46:19.636
THIS KIND OF A STRUCTURE HAS

02:46:19.703 --> 02:46:21.705
BEEN BUILT THAT SOMEONE LEFT AND

02:46:21.771 --> 02:46:23.506
LANDED IN THE NETWORK AND THEN

02:46:23.573 --> 02:46:25.041
CONTINUE TO GO TO THE EDGE AND

02:46:25.108 --> 02:46:27.410
JUMP IN AND MOVED DOWN TO THE

02:46:27.477 --> 02:46:28.011
AND AND ACTUALLY DIE FROM SO

02:46:28.078 --> 02:46:29.846

WHAT WHAT THE DISTRICT EXPLAIN

02:46:55.171 --> 02:46:56.539
WITH TO US THAT WAS VERY

02:46:56.606 --> 02:46:58.208
INTERESTING AND ENCOURAGING IS

02:46:58.274 --> 02:47:00.643
THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A?

02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:02.579
LAYERS OF STRATEGY TO PREVENT

02:47:02.645 --> 02:47:04.714
SUICIDE INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO

CONSTANTLY WALK UP AND DOWN AND

02:47:06.282 --> 02:47:07.050
RIDE BIKES UP AND DOWN THE

02:47:07.117 --> 02:47:08.718
BRIDGE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE AND

02:47:08.785 --> 02:47:10.120
THEY SAID A COUPLE OF THINGS.

02:47:10.186 --> 02:47:11.654
THAT A SINGLE FEMALE WITHOUT A

MINUTES OF BEING NOTICED.

02:47:15.725 --> 02:47:16.526
BECAUSE IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE A

02:47:16.593 --> 02:47:18.628
PERSON OR HAND IT'S PROBABLY IN

02:47:18.695 --> 02:47:20.029
THE CAR WITH A NOTE.

02:47:20.096 --> 02:47:22.565
AND SO EVERY WOMAN WITH NO PURSE

02:47:22.632 --> 02:47:23.767
EVERY STE I'VE I'VE FORGOTTEN

02:47:23.833 --> 02:47:25.802

OUTFIT ANYWHERE WITH KIDS.

02:47:29.038 --> 02:47:31.007
SO THEY THEY ACTUALLY STUDY

02:47:31.074 --> 02:47:32.742
WHERE AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS

02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:34.077
PEOPLE ARE JUMPING OFF THE

02:47:34.144 --> 02:47:35.478
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE TO TRY TO PUT

02:47:35.545 --> 02:47:37.046
IN PLACE INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE

02:47:37.113 --> 02:47:39.015
DESIGNED AROUND THE HISTORY THAT

02:47:39.082 --> 02:47:40.850
THEY'VE SEEN.

02:47:40.917 --> 02:47:41.117

STRUCTURE OF THE BRIDGE WHERE

02:47:45.789 --> 02:47:46.890
THEY'VE HAD TO ACTUALLY READ

02:47:46.956 --> 02:47:48.391
DESIGNED THAT WAY IN WHICH

02:47:48.458 --> 02:47:49.826
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TO DO

02:47:49.893 --> 02:47:51.094
MAINTENANCE ON THE BRIDGE WITH

02:47:51.161 --> 02:47:52.095

IS PART OF A AN INTEGRATED

02:48:16.085 --> 02:48:17.620

02:52:27.437 --> 02:52:28.905
CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE

02:52:28.971 --> 02:52:31.374

02:53:12.081 --> 02:53:13.182
NOT THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO

02:53:13.249 --> 02:53:15.118
SHARE WITH THEIR FAMILIES THESE

02:53:15.184 --> 02:53:16.018
ARE NOT THINGS THAT MIGHT SHARE

02:53:16.085 --> 02:53:17.787
WITH THEIR FRIENDS WE KNOW THAT

02:53:17.854 --> 02:53:18.855
THEY TAXED.

02:53:18.921 --> 02:53:22.759
ON WE'VE WE NOW HAVE THIS TAX

02:53:22.825 --> 02:53:27.130
LAW IT'S FOCUSED ON YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:53:27.196 --> 02:53:28.765
AND WE STOOD THAT UP SEVERAL

02:53:28.831 --> 02:53:30.333
MONTHS AGO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF

02:53:30.399 --> 02:53:32.368
YOUNG PEOPLE USE THIS BECAUSE

02:53:32.435 --> 02:53:33.770
ONE OF THE WAYS TO REACH THESE

02:53:33.836 --> 02:53:34.937
YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE RAISING

02:53:35.004 --> 02:53:36.139
THESE QUESTIONS.

02:53:36.205 --> 02:53:37.840
IS THEY DON'T PICK UP THE PHONE

02:53:37.907 --> 02:53:38.941
AND TALK AND THEY DON'T

02:53:39.008 --> 02:53:40.243
NECESSARILY TALK TO THEIR

02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:42.478
FAMILIES BUT THEY DO TAX WITH

02:53:42.545 --> 02:53:43.746
ONE ANOTHER AND SO WE'RE REALLY

02:53:43.813 --> 02:53:46.382
TRYING TO TRACK WHAT DATA WE CAN.

02:53:46.449 --> 02:53:48.684
RECEIVE FROM THAT TO SEE IF

02:53:48.751 --> 02:53:50.319
THEY'RE CLUSTERS WITH THE AGE

02:53:50.386 --> 02:53:52.155
GROUPINGS ARE THERE'S WE WE

02:53:52.221 --> 02:53:54.524
DON'T VIOLATE ANY OF THE PRIVACY

02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:55.658
REQUIREMENTS.

02:53:55.725 --> 02:53:57.293
BUT I THINK LOOKING A CULTURE

02:53:57.360 --> 02:54:00.797
LOOKING AT SUICIDE AT ALL LEVELS --

02:54:00.863 --> 02:54:03.366
MANY DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND

02:54:03.432 --> 02:54:04.967
IDENTIFYING WITH THE BEST

02:54:05.034 --> 02:54:06.736
PRACTICES ARE NATIONALLY I'M

02:54:06.803 --> 02:54:08.070
REALLY PROUD OF THE PLAN WE PUT

02:54:08.137 --> 02:54:09.071
TOGETHER.

02:54:09.138 --> 02:54:11.507
AND WE ARE SHARING IT WITH THE

02:54:11.574 --> 02:54:13.976
OAC AND MANY OF THE COUNTIES

02:54:14.043 --> 02:54:15.745
HAVE ASKED CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT

02:54:15.812 --> 02:54:17.446
WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE WHAT I

02:54:17.513 --> 02:54:19.649

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:20.583
ARE ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO ARE

02:54:20.650 --> 02:54:22.018
NOT PROFESSIONALS.

02:54:22.084 --> 02:54:23.286
ARE ALL FAMILY MEMBERS WHO'VE

02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:25.254
LOST CHILDREN AND THEY'RE VERY

02:54:25.321 --> 02:54:27.256
DEDICATED TO THIS WORK AND ARE

02:54:27.323 --> 02:54:29.225
LOBBYING APPEARS WELL FOR

02:55:39.896 --> 02:55:41.130
ONE ANOTHER.

02:55:41.197 --> 02:55:41.697

TRIBAL MEMBERS --

02:55:46.769 --> 02:55:48.704
AND WE HAVE SEEN --

02:55:48.771 --> 02:55:50.506
AT ONE POINT THERE WAS A CLUSTER

02:55:50.573 --> 02:55:51.807
OF CHILDREN --

02:55:51.874 --> 02:55:53.175

SO I GUESS PART OF WHAT I'M

02:55:57.179 --> 02:55:58.414
DOING IS I'M HOPING THAT AS THIS

02:55:58.481 --> 02:56:00.483
STRATEGIC PLAN COMES OUT FROM

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:01.384
THE STATE.

02:56:01.450 --> 02:56:03.085
THAT IT RECOGNIZES THAT --

02:56:03.152 --> 02:56:04.820
THE TRINITY COUNTY IS MUCH

02:56:04.887 --> 02:56:05.688
DIFFERENT THAN SANTA CLARA

02:56:05.755 --> 02:56:07.290
COUNTY AND THE STRATEGY SHOULD

02:56:07.356 --> 02:56:09.692
BE A REFLECTIVE OF THAT --

02:56:09.759 --> 02:56:12.428
AND I AND I I'M STILL WOULD LOVE.

02:56:12.495 --> 02:56:13.763

LEVEL OF OF FOCUS FOR THE

02:57:29.372 --> 02:57:31.640
POPULATION BUT I THINK THERE

02:57:31.707 --> 02:57:33.109
NEEDS TO BE A A LARGER.

02:57:33.175 --> 02:57:35.011

02:57:49.492 --> 02:57:50.426

02:57:50.493 --> 02:57:51.627
BECAUSE WE'RE NEVER GOING TO

02:57:56.932 --> 02:57:58.334
QUESTION --

02:57:58.401 --> 02:58:00.002
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MIDDLE

02:58:00.069 --> 02:58:01.804
AGED WHITE MEN AND WHAT'S GOING

02:58:01.871 --> 02:58:04.707
ON AND WHILE THE ISSUES AND

02:58:04.774 --> 02:58:06.275
SANTA CLARA MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

02:58:06.342 --> 02:58:08.010
IN THE SMALL COUNTIES.

02:58:08.077 --> 02:58:09.311
I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY

02:58:09.378 --> 02:58:11.380
MORE COMMON COMMONALITY THAN YOU

02:58:11.447 --> 02:58:13.382
MIGHT EXPECT AND I WOULD BE

02:58:13.449 --> 02:58:14.483
HAPPY I KNOW THE ALL THE

02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:15.718
DIRECTORS AND I'VE WORKED WITH

02:58:15.785 --> 02:58:17.086
THE SMALL COUNTIES.

02:58:17.153 --> 02:58:18.320
I WILL REACH OUT TO THE

02:58:18.387 --> 02:58:19.822

IN SANTA CLARA.

02:58:35.104 --> 02:58:36.572
BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT SANTA

02:58:36.639 --> 02:58:38.541
CLARA IS THAT WE HAVE RESOURCES

02:58:38.607 --> 02:58:40.609
TO DO THINGS BUT WE WANT TO

02:58:40.676 --> 02:58:42.845

02:58:44.947 --> 02:58:47.383
ACROSS THE STATE SO WHEN I'M

02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:49.185
SHARING IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:58:49.251 --> 02:58:51.087

02:59:03.599 --> 02:59:04.834
OF THINGS WERE DOING.

02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:06.035
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S

02:59:06.102 --> 02:59:07.203
BEEN TRIAL AND ERROR.

02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:09.738
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT WERE WE'VE

TO LEARN FROM THIS.

02:59:15.244 --> 02:59:17.146
AND THE REAL MEASURE IS ARE WE

02:59:17.213 --> 02:59:19.648

02:59:26.188 --> 02:59:26.689
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT

02:59:26.755 --> 02:59:29.525
COMMENT.

02:59:29.592 --> 02:59:31.427
I DON'T I DON'T.

02:59:31.494 --> 02:59:33.329
A LITTLE BIT.

02:59:33.395 --> 02:59:34.997
HOW LONG IS YOUR PLAN BEEN IN

02:59:35.064 --> 02:59:35.397
EFFECT?

02:59:35.464 --> 02:59:36.499
SEVERAL YEARS AND I'M I'VE BEEN

02:59:36.565 --> 02:59:37.633
THERE FOR YEARS AND IT WAS IN

02:59:37.700 --> 02:59:39.902
PLACE WHEN I WALKED IN MAYBE IT

02:59:39.969 --> 02:59:41.570
WAS THE FIRST REITERATION.

02:59:41.637 --> 02:59:43.172
SO RECOGNIZING THAT THEY THESE

02:59:43.239 --> 02:59:44.573
PLANS CONTINUE TO INVOLVE WAIT

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:46.208
WHAT IS YOUR NUMBER RELATIVE TO

02:59:46.275 --> 02:59:47.977
THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE AND ARE

02:59:48.043 --> 02:59:49.545
YOU SEEING ARE YOU SEEN.

02:59:49.612 --> 02:59:51.046
AND IT AN INCREASE IN TRACK AND

02:59:51.113 --> 02:59:52.982
IN FOR YOU SEEN AS AS LEVELED

02:59:53.048 --> 02:59:54.517
OFF AND IT'S IT'S LEVELED OFF

02:59:54.583 --> 02:59:55.818
SOMEWHAT --

02:59:55.885 --> 02:59:58.787
WERE TRACKING BOTH THE YOUTH --

02:59:58.854 --> 03:00:00.122
WE ACTUALLY IN SANTA CLARA WE

03:00:00.189 --> 03:00:02.691
HAD A CDC KIND OF THE CDC CAME

03:00:02.758 --> 03:00:04.460
IN BECAUSE OF OUR CLUSTERS.

03:00:04.527 --> 03:00:06.996
AND WE'VE WORKED REALLY CLOSELY

03:00:07.062 --> 03:00:08.430
WITH MANY MANY COMMUNITY

03:00:08.497 --> 03:00:10.533
PARTNERS TO TRY TO DECREASE

03:00:10.599 --> 03:00:12.268
THOSE NUMBERS FOR YOUTH.

03:00:12.334 --> 03:00:16.839
AND THEN ON THE MIDDLE AGE

03:00:16.906 --> 03:00:18.974
CLOSELY AS WELL.

03:00:19.041 --> 03:00:20.943
SO -- WE

03:00:21.010 --> 03:00:23.078
HAVE A TEAM I'VE FUNDED AT

03:00:23.145 --> 03:00:25.147
THROUGH IMAGE SAY --

03:00:25.214 --> 03:00:26.749
WERE ACTUALLY ADDING MORE MANY

03:00:26.815 --> 03:00:28.417
AT THIS POINT IN TIME --

03:00:28.484 --> 03:00:30.452
BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT SOMEBODY

03:00:30.519 --> 03:00:32.521
THAT CAN BE TOTALLY FOCUSED ON

03:00:32.588 --> 03:00:34.356
THE MIDDLE AGED MAN FROM A

03:00:34.423 --> 03:00:35.891
COMMUNICATIONS STANDPOINT AN

03:00:35.958 --> 03:00:38.194
ENGAGEMENT STANDPOINT SO WE'VE

03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:39.228
BEEN ABLE TO HIRE SOME

03:00:39.295 --> 03:00:40.796
ADDITIONAL STAFF TO HELP US.

03:00:40.863 --> 03:00:41.964
SO IS YOUR TEAM FUNDED IN THE

03:00:42.031 --> 03:00:43.365
SAME WAY THAT I WAS --

03:00:43.432 --> 03:00:44.900
VOICING CONCERNS ABOUT.

03:00:44.967 --> 03:00:48.671
YES WE ARE FINDING OUT THAT.

03:00:48.737 --> 03:00:51.073
IT'S A VERY DIRECT QUESTION YES --

03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:52.007
I KNOW.

03:00:52.074 --> 03:00:53.909
SO I WILL TELL YOU THAT FUNDING

03:00:53.976 --> 03:00:56.779
IN GENERAL IS VERY CHALLENGING --

03:00:56.845 --> 03:00:58.047
FOR THE COUNTIES BECAUSE WE

03:00:58.113 --> 03:00:59.315
DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT ARE

03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:01.750
FUNDING WILL BE FOR AN HSA WE

03:01:01.817 --> 03:01:03.252
DEVELOP PLANS.

03:01:03.319 --> 03:01:05.354
AND WE THINK OKAY THIS IS OUR

03:01:05.421 --> 03:01:06.155
FUNDING.

03:01:06.222 --> 03:01:08.023
AND THEN THAT FUNDING CAN SHIFT

03:01:08.090 --> 03:01:10.459
IT CAN GO UP OR IT CAN GO DOWN.

03:01:10.526 --> 03:01:13.495
OF WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH A

03:01:13.562 --> 03:01:14.763
CONSULTANT TO WORKS WITH THE

03:01:14.830 --> 03:01:16.699
DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO LOOK AT

03:01:16.765 --> 03:01:18.300
WHAT THE ESTIMATES WILL BE IN

03:01:18.367 --> 03:01:19.935
TERMS OF THE TAXES.

03:01:20.002 --> 03:01:23.672
SO THAT COUNTIES CAN THE FUNDING

03:01:23.739 --> 03:01:25.708
WILL LOOK LIKE BUT IT IT IS

03:01:25.774 --> 03:01:27.076
CHALLENGING.

03:01:27.142 --> 03:01:28.344
I I JUST HAVE TO SAY ON BEHALF

03:01:28.410 --> 03:01:29.645
OF ALL COUNTIES IT'S VERY

03:01:29.712 --> 03:01:31.814
CHALLENGING SO ANOTHER METHOD OF

03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:33.616
FUNDING MIGHT.

03:01:33.682 --> 03:01:35.584
POTENTIALLY HELP COUNTIES TO

03:01:35.651 --> 03:01:36.452
ACTUALLY SPEND SOME OF THIS

03:01:36.518 --> 03:01:38.320
MONEY WELL I THINK THE IMAGE AS

03:01:38.387 --> 03:01:40.489
A IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY IT

03:01:40.556 --> 03:01:42.091
ALLOWS US TO DO PREVENTION AND

03:01:42.157 --> 03:01:43.692
EARLY INTERVENTION.

03:01:43.759 --> 03:01:45.261
IT ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE MANY

03:01:45.327 --> 03:01:46.662
TYPES OF SERVICES THAT WOULD NOT

03:01:46.729 --> 03:01:48.664
NECESSARILY BE COVERED UNDER

03:01:48.731 --> 03:01:49.932
MEDICARE ALL.

03:01:49.999 --> 03:01:52.735
AND SO IT'S ENABLED A LOT OF THE

03:01:52.801 --> 03:01:53.769
SERVICES THAT YOU'VE HEARD IN

03:01:53.836 --> 03:01:55.137
THIS HEARING AND ANOTHER

03:01:55.204 --> 03:01:57.139
HEARINGS --

03:01:57.206 --> 03:01:58.707
BUT NOT WITH PREDICTABILITY.

03:01:58.774 --> 03:02:00.542
NOT WITH PREDICTABILITY IN TERMS

03:02:00.609 --> 03:02:03.345
OF THE OF THE FUNDING PIECE NOW.

03:02:03.412 --> 03:02:04.880
AND SO THAT CREATES SON

03:02:04.947 --> 03:02:06.348
CERTAINLY WITHIN YOUR PROGRAMS

03:02:06.415 --> 03:02:08.817
AND IT IS CHALLENGING FOR

03:02:08.884 --> 03:02:10.219
COUNTIES --

03:02:10.286 --> 03:02:12.054
WHEN WE COMPLETE A PLAN OUR

03:02:12.121 --> 03:02:13.889
IMAGE AS A PLAN GOES EVERY YEAR

03:02:13.956 --> 03:02:15.157
WE HAVE AN UPDATE?

03:02:15.224 --> 03:02:16.358
AND WE GO TO OUR BOARD OF

03:02:16.425 --> 03:02:18.694
SUPERVISORS AND MORE MANAGING

03:02:18.761 --> 03:02:20.696
VERY VERY CAREFULLY HOW WE'RE

03:02:20.763 --> 03:02:22.097
SPENDING THE MONEY.

03:02:22.164 --> 03:02:24.500
BUT IT'S ALSO CHALLENGING FOR

03:02:24.566 --> 03:02:26.802
COUNTIES BECAUSE ONCE THE MONEY

03:02:26.869 --> 03:02:28.437
ARRIVES WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH

03:02:28.504 --> 03:02:29.471
THE PLAN AND THEN WE HAVE TO

03:02:29.538 --> 03:02:30.706
IMPLEMENT.

03:02:30.773 --> 03:02:32.341
AN IMPLEMENT --

03:02:32.408 --> 03:02:34.043
IMPLEMENTING IF YOU HAVE

03:02:34.109 --> 03:02:36.345
CONTRACT AGENCIES REQUIRES

03:02:36.412 --> 03:02:38.080
PROCUREMENT PROCESS SO

03:02:38.147 --> 03:02:39.848
EVERYTHING GETS DELAYED IT'S NOT

03:02:39.915 --> 03:02:42.384
IT'S RARELY BECAUSE I I I'VE

03:02:42.451 --> 03:02:43.786
BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

03:02:43.852 --> 03:02:45.854
IT'S NEVER BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE

03:02:45.921 --> 03:02:47.256
HAVE SOMETHING BE DELAYED BUT

03:02:47.323 --> 03:02:49.391
IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS

03:02:49.458 --> 03:02:52.461
YES SO --

03:02:52.528 --> 03:02:56.198
AND THAT THIS THIS GOES BACK.

03:02:56.265 --> 03:02:57.766
TO OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAD A MORE

03:02:57.833 --> 03:02:59.468
DEPENDABLE IF THERE'S ANOTHER

03:02:59.535 --> 03:03:00.769
WAY TO PROCURE THE MONEY SO YOU

03:03:00.836 --> 03:03:01.870
COULD HAVE THE PREDICTABILITY

03:03:01.937 --> 03:03:03.439
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING YOU

03:03:03.505 --> 03:03:05.207
WOULD HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN.

03:03:05.274 --> 03:03:05.808
WELL I THINK WE WOULD HAVE A

03:03:05.874 --> 03:03:06.842
STRONG INTEREST IN

03:03:06.909 --> 03:03:08.444
PREDICTABILITY I AM ALSO VERY

03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:09.945
FAMILIAR WITH THE ACT IN THE

03:03:10.012 --> 03:03:11.547
FUNDING IS BASED ON A TAX ON

03:03:11.613 --> 03:03:13.248
MILLIONAIRES TAX.

03:03:13.315 --> 03:03:14.516
AND SO --

03:03:14.583 --> 03:03:15.617
AND IT'S LEGISLATIVE AND

03:03:15.684 --> 03:03:17.453
REGULATED SO I'M NOT SURE THAT

03:03:17.519 --> 03:03:19.488
THAT WOULD BE EASILY FIGURED OUT

03:03:19.555 --> 03:03:20.856
THAT WOULD BE FOR ALL OF THE

03:03:20.923 --> 03:03:22.191
LEGISLATURE TO DO WITH THE

03:03:22.257 --> 03:03:23.692
GOVERNOR --

03:03:23.759 --> 03:03:24.993
I DO THINK THAT THE

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:26.195
PREDICTABILITY CAN BE

03:03:26.261 --> 03:03:27.563
CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY FOR THE

03:03:27.629 --> 03:03:29.531
SMALLER COMPANIES OURS AS WELL

03:03:29.598 --> 03:03:32.234
BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE SMART

03:03:32.301 --> 03:03:33.435
THAT WAS THE POINT THANK YOU YES.

03:03:33.502 --> 03:03:35.437
AND IF I MAY ACT.

03:03:35.504 --> 03:03:36.872
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FUNDING

03:03:36.939 --> 03:03:38.440
THAT GOES OUT TO THE COUNTIES I

03:03:38.507 --> 03:03:39.808
JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THE

03:03:39.875 --> 03:03:41.610
FUNDS AND THEY WERE JUST BEING

03:03:41.677 --> 03:03:43.379
SPOKE ABOUT THOSE ARE ALLOCATED

03:03:43.445 --> 03:03:45.280
TO COUNTIES MONTHLY.

03:03:45.347 --> 03:03:48.150
SO 95% OF FUNDS FOR THE ACT GO

03:03:48.217 --> 03:03:49.618
DIRECTLY OUT TO THE COUNTIES ARE

03:03:49.685 --> 03:03:51.587
ALLOCATED TO THE COUNTIES MONTH

03:03:51.653 --> 03:03:53.155
ON A MONTHLY BASIS BASED ON

03:03:53.222 --> 03:03:54.556
INCOMING REVENUE.

03:03:54.623 --> 03:03:56.825
THE 5% IS WITH HELD FOR STATE

03:03:56.892 --> 03:03:58.727
DIRECTED PURPOSES WAS THE

03:03:58.794 --> 03:03:59.294
FUNDING THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT

03:03:59.361 --> 03:04:04.733
EARLIER.

03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:06.769
ALL RIGHT IN THE ANYBODY ELSE ON

03:04:06.835 --> 03:04:09.772
THE PANEL.

03:04:09.838 --> 03:04:12.174
SO WHAT IS A 5% ACTUALLY ADD UP

03:04:12.241 --> 03:04:14.209
TO NEARLY FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR

03:04:14.276 --> 03:04:16.111
OF THE MHS.

03:04:16.178 --> 03:04:19.148
SO I BELIEVE IN NINETEEN TWENTY

03:04:19.214 --> 03:04:21.984
WERE ESTIMATING IT TO BE.

03:04:22.050 --> 03:04:24.553
I WANT TO SAY UPWARDS OF MAYBE A

03:04:24.620 --> 03:04:25.320
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION.

03:04:25.387 --> 03:04:27.423
THROUGH TO ADMINISTER THE IMAGES

03:04:27.489 --> 03:04:29.925
SAY.

03:04:29.992 --> 03:04:31.760
IT'S COSTING A HUNDRED TWENTY

03:04:31.827 --> 03:04:38.467
MILLION DOLLARS --

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:39.101
FOR THE STATE TO THE RESTAURANT

03:04:39.168 --> 03:04:41.069
SO WELL WE WE WE TRY TO GET STAY

03:04:41.136 --> 03:04:41.970
AWAY FROM THE TERM

03:04:42.037 --> 03:04:44.440
ADMINISTRATIVE BECAUSE IT'S NOT

03:04:44.506 --> 03:04:46.141
FOR TRUE ADMINISTRATION SO MUCH

03:04:46.208 --> 03:04:47.443
AS IT'S FOR MORE STATE DIRECTED

03:04:47.509 --> 03:04:48.644
PURPOSES.

03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:50.379
SO WHILE THERE ARE SOME FUNDING

03:04:50.446 --> 03:04:51.246
STREAMS --

03:04:51.313 --> 03:04:52.981
ALLOCATIONS WITHIN THE STATE

03:04:53.048 --> 03:04:54.249
DIRECTED PURPOSE FOR

03:04:54.316 --> 03:04:56.051
ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES IT IS

03:04:56.118 --> 03:04:57.453
ALSO AVAILABLE FOR OTHER

03:04:57.519 --> 03:04:59.421
PURPOSES SUCH AS COUNTY GRANTS

03:04:59.488 --> 03:05:03.826
AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE PARTY SO.

03:05:03.892 --> 03:05:05.194
YEAH I'D LIKE TO I'D ACTUALLY.

03:05:05.260 --> 03:05:06.528
UP WHEN I ASKED WHAT

03:05:06.595 --> 03:05:08.897
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE BORNE

03:05:08.964 --> 03:05:11.834
OUT OF THE MHSAA I DON'T WANT --

03:05:11.900 --> 03:05:13.035
TO FIGURE OF OTHER.

03:05:13.101 --> 03:05:15.270
COSTS BORNE BY IT SO WHAT I'M

03:05:15.337 --> 03:05:15.871
SAYING IS WHAT IS THE DIRECT

03:05:15.938 --> 03:05:16.939
COST.

03:05:17.005 --> 03:05:18.207
OF THE STATE TO ADMINISTER THEM

03:05:18.273 --> 03:05:19.608
HSA.

03:05:19.675 --> 03:05:22.044
HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING --

03:05:22.110 --> 03:05:24.379
DEPLETED AWAY FROM THE ACTUAL

03:05:24.446 --> 03:05:25.848
SERVICES GOOD COULD BE PROVIDED.

03:05:25.914 --> 03:05:27.749
SO FOR NINETEEN TWENTY THERE'S

03:05:27.816 --> 03:05:29.885
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

03:05:29.952 --> 03:05:32.588
TWENTY MILLION --

03:05:32.654 --> 03:05:34.056
FOR STATE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:05:34.122 --> 03:05:36.225
PURPOSES OKAY THANK YOU.

03:05:36.291 --> 03:05:37.192
THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:05:37.259 --> 03:05:39.127
PURPOSES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO

03:05:39.194 --> 03:05:41.864
IMAGES SAY OR OTHER OR THE OTHER

03:05:41.930 --> 03:05:43.532
STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES.

03:05:43.599 --> 03:05:47.402
AS PRIMARILY IT'S A IT'S A MIX.

03:05:47.469 --> 03:05:48.871
THERE'S APPROXIMATELY.

03:05:48.937 --> 03:05:50.272
SOME OF IT'S GOING TO STATE

03:05:50.339 --> 03:05:52.074
ADMINISTRATION SO STATE

03:05:52.140 --> 03:05:52.875
POSITIONS AND THINGS OF THAT

03:05:52.941 --> 03:05:53.809
NATURE.

03:05:53.876 --> 03:05:55.010
THERE IS ALSO SOME FUNDING IN

03:05:55.077 --> 03:05:57.412
THERE FOR THINGS LIKE SUICIDE

03:05:57.479 --> 03:05:58.981
HOTLINES AND TRIAGE.

03:05:59.047 --> 03:06:01.183
GRANTS [inaudible]

03:06:01.250 --> 03:06:03.352
OKAY [inaudible]

03:06:03.418 --> 03:06:06.455

03:18:33.801 --> 03:18:35.036
CANNOT USE STATE FUNDS.

03:18:35.103 --> 03:18:37.105
SO THIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION

03:18:37.171 --> 03:18:40.008
CANNOT BE USED TO FUND THIRTEEN

03:18:40.074 --> 03:18:41.876
FIFTEEN ALTHOUGH THAT SEEMS LIKE

03:18:41.943 --> 03:18:43.711
THAT WOULD BE THE MOST

03:18:43.778 --> 03:18:45.546
APPROPRIATE THING TO DO --

03:18:45.613 --> 03:18:47.615
BUT THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T ALLOW

03:18:47.682 --> 03:18:49.150
IT -- THERE

03:18:49.217 --> 03:18:50.952
IS ANOTHER BILL PENDING THAT

03:18:51.019 --> 03:18:54.088
WOULD THEN ALLOW THEM --

03:18:54.155 --> 03:18:54.689
TO TO THIRTEEN FIFTEEN TO USE

03:18:54.756 --> 03:18:55.890
THE STATE FUNDS.

03:18:55.957 --> 03:18:57.692
SO HOPEFULLY.

03:18:57.759 --> 03:18:59.093
NOT HOPEFULLY.

03:18:59.160 --> 03:19:00.295
MR FRAZIER [inaudible]

03:19:00.361 --> 03:19:02.363
SO.

03:19:02.430 --> 03:19:03.431
YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT AN

03:19:03.498 --> 03:19:04.732
ALLOCATION TWENTY FIVE MILLION

03:19:04.799 --> 03:19:07.402
DOLLARS.

03:19:07.468 --> 03:19:10.171
YOU'RE ALREADY IN PROCESS.

03:19:10.238 --> 03:19:10.805
THEY WOULD HAVE TO RECREATE THE

03:19:10.872 --> 03:19:13.908
WHEEL AND START FROM SCRATCH.

03:19:13.975 --> 03:19:15.176
WHY WOULD YOU HAND OVER

03:19:15.243 --> 03:19:16.477
SOMETHING I MEAN IT'S YOUR BABY

03:19:16.544 --> 03:19:17.612
WHY WOULD YOU HAND OVER

03:19:17.679 --> 03:19:19.414
SOMETHING IS ALREADY IN PROCESS?

03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:20.181
KNOWING THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY

03:19:20.248 --> 03:19:22.717
STE TAKE THE BALL AND CONTINUE

03:19:22.784 --> 03:19:24.552
TO RUN AND THIS WOULD.

03:19:24.619 --> 03:19:26.387
TAKE MORE TIME TO IMPLEMENT HIS

03:19:26.454 --> 03:19:28.356
HE'S GOT NO MONEY WELL. ONE OF

03:19:28.423 --> 03:19:30.224
THE OTHER THINGS IS.

03:19:30.291 --> 03:19:33.394
IS ZERO SIX MONEY --

03:19:33.461 --> 03:19:34.696
BUT WHAT IS A CRITICAL NEED I

03:19:34.762 --> 03:19:36.064
MEAN IN YOUR STUDIES IN IN YOUR

03:19:36.130 --> 03:19:37.532
WORK WHEN YOU LOOK AT EARLY

03:19:37.598 --> 03:19:39.701
PSYCHOSIS.

03:19:39.767 --> 03:19:41.202
WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF

03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:43.371
FUNDING.

03:19:43.438 --> 03:19:47.208
THAT YOU NEED TO BE EFFECTIVE.

03:19:47.275 --> 03:19:47.742
CERTAINLY OVER TWENTY FIVE

03:19:47.809 --> 03:19:48.609
MILLION DOLLARS.

03:19:48.676 --> 03:19:50.578
IT'S A START IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT

03:19:50.645 --> 03:19:52.246
I'M SAYING IS WE WE WE PUT A OF

03:19:52.313 --> 03:19:53.581
OF POCKET MONEY HERE WITH A

03:19:53.648 --> 03:19:55.383
LITTLE BIT HERE.

03:19:55.450 --> 03:19:55.883
IT'S LIKE A LIKE PLAYING

03:19:55.950 --> 03:19:56.317
ROULETTE [inaudible]

03:19:56.384 --> 03:19:59.120
OKAY. TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE

03:19:59.187 --> 03:20:00.521
PLAYING ROULETTE.

03:20:00.588 --> 03:20:01.923
WE'LL PUT A LITTLE BIT HERE AND

03:20:01.989 --> 03:20:02.890
HAD YOUR BEST LITTLE BIT HERE.

03:20:02.957 --> 03:20:05.493
DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH IT TAKES TO

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:09.230
DO THESE THINGS CAN BE EFFECTIVE.

03:20:09.297 --> 03:20:10.498
SO AT THAT OUT INTO THE FIRST

03:20:10.565 --> 03:20:11.833
QUICK QUESTION AT THAT IF I WAS

03:20:11.899 --> 03:20:13.835
ASKED TO SPLIT THE BABY I WOULD

03:20:13.901 --> 03:20:15.536
GIVE UP MY HALF OF THE BABY.

03:20:15.603 --> 03:20:17.572
SO YOU KNOW WHY WOULD I GIVE UP

03:20:17.638 --> 03:20:19.240
A PROGRAM THAT WERE ALREADY

03:20:19.307 --> 03:20:20.875
RESIDING UP AND RIGHT BUT YOU

03:20:20.942 --> 03:20:22.043
KNOW SUBJECT TO THE

03:20:22.110 --> 03:20:24.312
DELIBERATIONS BETWEEN

03:20:24.379 --> 03:20:24.946
ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE.

03:20:25.012 --> 03:20:26.547
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE

03:20:26.614 --> 03:20:28.750
STATE TO HAVE TO PROGRAMS AND SO

03:20:28.816 --> 03:20:30.184
YOU KNOW IDEALLY FUND THE

03:20:30.251 --> 03:20:31.586
PROGRAM THAT THAT YOU AUTHORIZE

03:20:31.652 --> 03:20:32.787
LAST YEAR.

03:20:32.854 --> 03:20:34.489
BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN

03:20:34.555 --> 03:20:36.124
THE LAW WHICH YOU KNOW VERY

03:20:36.190 --> 03:20:37.892
CLEARLY AS AS FROM MEMBER WOULD

03:20:37.959 --> 03:20:39.727
MENTION EARLIER THAT THAT'S THE

03:20:39.794 --> 03:20:41.763
BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE IN --

03:20:41.829 --> 03:20:44.198
IN TERMS OF THE I I DON'T KNOW

03:20:44.265 --> 03:20:45.333
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE I CAN TELL

03:20:45.400 --> 03:20:46.801
YOU THAT THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS

03:20:46.868 --> 03:20:48.970
THAT WAS GENERATED FROM COUNTY

03:20:49.036 --> 03:20:52.740
FUNDS AND PHILANTHROPY WE PUT A

03:20:52.807 --> 03:20:53.374
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE

03:20:53.441 --> 03:20:54.876
TABLE. TO FACILITATE GENERATING

03:20:54.942 --> 03:20:57.545
TEN MILLION.

03:20:57.612 --> 03:20:59.313
IN PHILANTHROPY AND COUNTY

03:20:59.380 --> 03:21:02.483
DOLLARS SO WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK

03:21:02.550 --> 03:21:04.552
CLOSELY AT HOW TO LEVERAGE THAT

03:21:04.619 --> 03:21:05.486
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO

03:21:05.553 --> 03:21:06.421
CREATE THE RIGHT KINDS OF

03:21:06.487 --> 03:21:08.656
INCENTIVES. TO HELP TEACH

03:21:08.723 --> 03:21:10.691
COUNTIES HOW TO STAND UP THESE

03:21:10.758 --> 03:21:12.427
PROGRAMS AND CREATE THE BUILDING

03:21:12.493 --> 03:21:14.162
STRUCTURE UNDER MEDI CAL AND

03:21:14.228 --> 03:21:16.230
OTHER SOURCES SO THAT THAT SO

03:21:16.297 --> 03:21:17.698
THAT THE PROGRAM TO BE SUSTAINED.

03:21:17.765 --> 03:21:19.867
OUR OUR QUINCY DALY OUR SENSE

03:21:19.934 --> 03:21:21.836
WAS THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY NEED

03:21:21.903 --> 03:21:23.304
BUT BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY

03:21:23.371 --> 03:21:25.306
MILLION DOLLARS TO TRY TO DESIGN

03:21:25.373 --> 03:21:27.008
A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE WHERE

03:21:27.074 --> 03:21:28.242
EVERY COUNTY HAD AN EARLY

03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:30.878
PSYCHOSIS STRATEGY IN PLACE.

03:21:30.945 --> 03:21:31.546
OUT OF ACCOUNTING THE STANDALONE

03:21:31.612 --> 03:21:32.513
PROGRAM.

03:21:32.580 --> 03:21:34.282
SMALL COUNTIES PROBABLY CAN'T DO

03:21:34.348 --> 03:21:35.817
THAT BUT THEY NEED A PARTNERSHIP.

03:21:35.883 --> 03:21:37.084
RIGHT THEY NEED TELEMEDICINE

03:21:37.151 --> 03:21:38.386
THEY NEED THESE THESE APPROACHES

03:21:38.453 --> 03:21:39.887
WE HAVE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

03:21:39.954 --> 03:21:41.456
WHAT AT THE REVENUE STREAMS THAT

03:21:41.522 --> 03:21:42.523
ARE AVAILABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE

03:21:42.590 --> 03:21:43.424
PROGRAMS.

03:21:43.491 --> 03:21:46.127
ON GOING SUCH AS MEDICARE RIGHT

03:21:46.194 --> 03:21:47.161
AND SO HOW DO WE BRING THIS

03:21:47.228 --> 03:21:49.330
COSTS DOWN SO I WOULD SAY --

03:21:49.397 --> 03:21:50.865
WE CAN DO A TON OF TWENTY FIVE

03:21:50.932 --> 03:21:53.367
MILLION DOLLARS EVEN ONE TIME.

03:21:53.434 --> 03:21:55.603
AND AND AND THAT MAY BE

03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:57.371
SUFFICIENT BUT I'D I HONESTLY

03:21:57.438 --> 03:21:58.639
DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT REALLY

03:21:58.706 --> 03:22:02.577
GETS THAT OUR CAPACITY TO

03:22:02.643 --> 03:22:03.144
LEVERAGE THAT AGAINST OTHER

03:22:03.211 --> 03:22:04.212
FUNDING.

03:22:04.278 --> 03:22:05.079
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS

03:22:05.146 --> 03:22:05.646
YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF THESE

03:22:05.713 --> 03:22:06.614
HEARINGS.

03:22:06.681 --> 03:22:07.615
WERE FINDING OUT WHERE THE

03:22:07.682 --> 03:22:09.083
SHORTCOMINGS ARE OF EVEN

03:22:09.150 --> 03:22:10.952
LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED

03:22:11.018 --> 03:22:12.320
WHERE WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE

03:22:12.386 --> 03:22:13.688
IN.

03:22:13.754 --> 03:22:14.989
AND GENERATE --

03:22:15.056 --> 03:22:17.358
FIXES GOING ALONG LIKE THE

03:22:17.425 --> 03:22:19.694
FUNDING OF THE SUICIDE HOTLINE

03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:21.362
MONIES IN WHATNOT SO.

03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:22.296
I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S CANDOR

03:22:22.363 --> 03:22:25.666

MADAM CHAIR DO YOU MIND IF I

03:22:27.635 --> 03:22:29.103
JUMP IN BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF

03:22:29.170 --> 03:22:29.737
THE QUESTIONS WERE REALLY MORE

03:22:29.804 --> 03:22:31.572
DIRECTED AT WHAT WHAT WERE DOING

03:22:31.639 --> 03:22:32.740
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE THE ONES WHO

03:22:32.807 --> 03:22:34.242
ARE DIRECTED HAVE THE TWENTY

03:22:34.308 --> 03:22:35.643
FIVE MILLION SO I JUST WANTED TO

03:22:35.710 --> 03:22:36.410
ANSWER SOME OF DOCTOR WOULD

03:22:36.477 --> 03:22:37.545
QUESTIONS.

03:22:37.612 --> 03:22:38.946
AS I MENTIONED I THINK WE ARE WE

03:22:39.013 --> 03:22:40.414
ARE STILL DEVELOPING SORT OF WHO

03:22:40.481 --> 03:22:42.416
CAN APPLY AND ALL OF THAT WE ARE

03:22:42.483 --> 03:22:43.684
LOOKING OUT FOR ANY LARGER

03:22:43.751 --> 03:22:44.685

ORDER TO HELP SUPPORT THE

03:22:48.656 --> 03:22:50.525
ADDITIONAL WORK AND SO AT THIS

03:22:50.591 --> 03:22:52.226
POINT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC IN

03:22:52.293 --> 03:22:54.028
TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF GRANTS --

03:22:54.095 --> 03:22:55.696
BUT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

03:22:55.763 --> 03:22:57.031
DEVELOP IN FOR WORK WITH OUR

03:22:57.098 --> 03:22:58.399
COUNTY AND OTHER OTHER PARTNERS

03:22:58.466 --> 03:22:59.433
SO THAT THEN WE CAN HAVE

03:22:59.500 --> 03:23:01.836
COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL THAT

03:23:01.903 --> 03:23:03.571
WILL BE HAVING COME OUT. ONE

IN THE?

03:23:08.609 --> 03:23:10.111
PRIVATE SECTOR TO INVEST IN.

03:23:10.177 --> 03:23:11.045
IN A STATEMENT.

03:23:11.112 --> 03:23:13.714
REQUIRED THE PROGRAM THAT IS A

03:23:13.781 --> 03:23:15.383
STATE ISSUE.

03:23:15.449 --> 03:23:16.951
SO BASED ON THE WORK THAT HAS

03:23:17.018 --> 03:23:17.852
BEEN DONE THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:23:17.919 --> 03:23:19.020
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THINGS

03:23:19.086 --> 03:23:19.320
THAT -- OUR

03:23:19.387 --> 03:23:21.088
FELLOW PANELISTS OF TALK ABOUT

03:23:21.155 --> 03:23:23.157
WE ARE SEEING LOCAL NONPROFIT TO

03:23:23.224 --> 03:23:24.892
ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING

03:23:24.959 --> 03:23:26.594
THIS IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

03:23:26.661 --> 03:23:28.396
AND SO WE WANT TO HELP FUNDS

03:23:28.462 --> 03:23:29.964
THAT TO HELP US UNDERSTAND AS A

03:23:30.031 --> 03:23:31.966
STATE WHICH TYPES OF SERVICES

03:23:32.033 --> 03:23:33.267
WHAT'S TYPES OF STRUCTURES ARE

03:23:33.334 --> 03:23:34.402
ACTUALLY GONNA WORK.

03:23:34.468 --> 03:23:36.504
THEN WE CAN SCALE UP TO A FULLY

03:23:36.571 --> 03:23:38.139
STATEWIDE PROGRAM OKAY AND I'M

03:23:38.205 --> 03:23:41.008
SEEN HE HAS TO FUNCTIONALLY ON

03:23:41.075 --> 03:23:42.810
PRIVATE DONATIONS.

03:23:42.877 --> 03:23:44.679
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY A. B.

03:23:44.745 --> 03:23:46.347
THIRTEEN I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT

03:23:46.414 --> 03:23:48.349
THERE SHOULD BE.

03:23:48.416 --> 03:23:49.850
AN EFFORT.

03:23:49.917 --> 03:23:50.585
THIRTEEN FIFTY THROUGH THIS

03:23:50.651 --> 03:23:53.254
TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO TO WORK

03:23:53.321 --> 03:23:55.189
TOWARDS THEIR SUCCESS ALSO.

03:23:55.256 --> 03:23:55.623
YEAH.

03:23:55.690 --> 03:23:57.325
THAT WOULD BE THE LOGICAL THING

03:23:57.391 --> 03:23:58.292
BUT HEY.

03:23:58.359 --> 03:23:59.894
MADAM CHAIR COULD I MAKE A

03:23:59.961 --> 03:24:01.028
COMMENT ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK

03:24:01.095 --> 03:24:02.029
PREVIOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST

03:24:02.096 --> 03:24:04.332
IMPORTANT THINGS WERE TALKING

03:24:04.398 --> 03:24:05.533
ABOUT TODAY.

03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:07.134
THERE'S A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE AS

03:24:07.201 --> 03:24:09.203
AS IF WE GET THIS RIGHT WE CAN

03:24:09.270 --> 03:24:10.605
PREVENT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM

03:24:10.671 --> 03:24:12.907
WINDING UP FOR THE ADULT MENTAL

03:24:12.974 --> 03:24:15.443
HEALTH SYSTEM YES THERE'S LOTS

03:24:15.509 --> 03:24:16.077
AND LOTS OF RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN

03:24:16.143 --> 03:24:18.312
CAN.

03:24:18.379 --> 03:24:20.715
THE C. B. H. DATE TURN TOTALLY

03:24:20.781 --> 03:24:23.551
SPORTS THIS --

03:24:23.618 --> 03:24:27.054
IN MY COUNTY WE ARE ON IT AND I

03:24:27.121 --> 03:24:28.756
CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW

03:24:28.823 --> 03:24:30.758
IMPORTANT IT IS TO UNDERSTAND

03:24:30.825 --> 03:24:33.027
HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS AND HOW TO

03:24:33.094 --> 03:24:34.562
SCALE IT UP THIS THIS.

03:24:34.629 --> 03:24:36.664
IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING WE

03:24:36.731 --> 03:24:38.332
HAVE LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

03:24:38.399 --> 03:24:39.934
PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE

03:24:40.001 --> 03:24:42.403
COMING OUT OF JAIL AND THE WAY

03:24:42.470 --> 03:24:44.005
THAT WE STEM THAT TIDE.

03:24:44.071 --> 03:24:45.773
IS WE BECOME EXPERTS WITH THESE

03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:47.942
SERVICES AND SUPPORT THOSE YOUNG

03:24:48.009 --> 03:24:50.144
PEOPLE SAID TO ME THIS IS WHERE

03:24:50.211 --> 03:24:51.979
I'D I JUST THINK THIS IS HUGELY

03:24:52.046 --> 03:24:52.813
IMPORTANT.

03:24:52.880 --> 03:24:54.081
AND I'M ALSO GOING TO STEP OUT

03:24:54.148 --> 03:24:57.251
ON THE LIMB BECAUSE YOU ASKED

03:24:57.318 --> 03:24:58.019
ABOUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

03:24:58.085 --> 03:25:01.288
IF WE LOOK FORWARD --

03:25:01.355 --> 03:25:02.423
TO ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT

03:25:02.490 --> 03:25:04.258
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PARTICULARLY

03:25:04.325 --> 03:25:05.993
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

03:25:06.060 --> 03:25:08.562
ON THE PUBLIC SIDE WE FUND THESE

03:25:08.629 --> 03:25:09.730
PROGRAMS BUT THAT'S NOT

03:25:09.797 --> 03:25:11.332
NECESSARILY THE CASE FOR THE

03:25:11.399 --> 03:25:13.200
COMMERCIAL PLANS THE THE PRIVATE

03:25:13.267 --> 03:25:14.468
PLANS.

03:25:14.535 --> 03:25:15.836
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD

03:25:15.903 --> 03:25:17.538
IMAGINE I KNOW THAT THE

03:25:17.605 --> 03:25:19.340
DEPARTMENT IS INTERESTED IN.

03:25:19.407 --> 03:25:20.875
AND MISTER EWING IS INTERESTED

03:25:20.941 --> 03:25:22.243
IN AND AS THE COUNTIES WERE

03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:24.078
INTERESTED IN IS HOW DO WE

03:25:24.145 --> 03:25:25.946
ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THESE

03:25:26.013 --> 03:25:28.482
SERVICES TO ANY YOUNG PERSON.

03:25:28.549 --> 03:25:30.384
REGARDLESS OF IF THEY'RE MEDI

03:25:30.451 --> 03:25:32.386
CAL OR IF THEY'RE COMMERCIALLY

03:25:32.453 --> 03:25:34.622
INSURED. TO FROM FROM MY

03:25:34.689 --> 03:25:35.823
PERSPECTIVE I THINK YOUR

03:25:35.890 --> 03:25:37.258
PHYSICIAN I'VE BEEN AND HEALTH

03:25:37.324 --> 03:25:38.392
CARE FORTY YEARS.

03:25:38.459 --> 03:25:42.029
THIS TO ME IS --

03:25:42.096 --> 03:25:43.564
PIECES OF WORK WE CAN DO FOR

03:25:43.631 --> 03:25:45.066
YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

03:25:45.132 --> 03:25:46.333
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:48.636
AND SO I JUST WANT YOU TO HEAR

03:25:48.703 --> 03:25:50.504
MY ADVOCACY AS SOMEONE WHO RUNS

03:25:50.571 --> 03:25:52.506
A LARGE SYSTEM AND I WILL SAY

03:25:52.573 --> 03:25:54.108
THAT.

03:25:54.175 --> 03:25:55.543
IN COMPARISON WITH THE ID DE

03:25:55.609 --> 03:25:57.144
POPULATION.

03:25:57.211 --> 03:25:59.146
THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS OF THE

03:25:59.213 --> 03:26:01.816
FH MOSER PPO CANNOT FULFILL THE

03:26:01.882 --> 03:26:03.050
OBLIGATION.

03:26:03.117 --> 03:26:04.819
OF THE LETTERMAN ACTING AND MAKE

03:26:04.885 --> 03:26:07.121
SURE THAT INDIVIDUAL SERVICE AND

03:26:07.188 --> 03:26:09.156
THAT THE REGIONAL SERVICE

03:26:09.223 --> 03:26:09.990
CENTERS ARE HAVE TO

03:26:10.057 --> 03:26:13.027
AUTOMATICALLY FUND THAT

03:26:13.094 --> 03:26:14.695
INDIVIDUALS --

03:26:14.762 --> 03:26:17.698
SERVICES.

03:26:17.765 --> 03:26:19.100
THERE'S A MODELS ARE WORKING.

03:26:19.166 --> 03:26:20.468
I MEAN I I I JUST DON'T

03:26:20.534 --> 03:26:21.702
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

03:26:21.769 --> 03:26:22.903
RECREATE THE WHEEL.

03:26:22.970 --> 03:26:27.208
IT WORKS IN A POPULATION OF OF

03:26:27.274 --> 03:26:30.144
IN THE IN THAT CAPACITY.

03:26:30.211 --> 03:26:33.447
WELL IN THIS.

03:26:33.514 --> 03:26:37.284
I THINK THEY WERE ALL MISSING.

03:26:37.351 --> 03:26:38.886
TO TO YOUR POINT WHAT ON THE

03:26:38.953 --> 03:26:40.421
BACKGROUND INFORMATION IS GIVEN

03:26:40.488 --> 03:26:42.590

03:26:46.427 --> 03:26:48.229
1475% BY THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR

03:26:48.295 --> 03:26:50.231
AND UNTREATED INCREASES THE

03:26:50.297 --> 03:26:51.699
INDIVIDUAL'S RISK FOR SUICIDE.

03:26:51.766 --> 03:26:53.334
HOMELESSNESS AS THE NEED FOR

03:26:53.400 --> 03:26:55.169
MORE MENTAL HEALTH SO IF WE LOOK

03:26:55.236 --> 03:26:57.538
AT THE COST EARLY ON VERSUS THE

03:26:57.605 --> 03:26:57.872
COST.

03:26:57.938 --> 03:26:58.839
IT UNTIL --

03:26:58.906 --> 03:27:00.608
DURING THE LIFETIME YOU'RE

03:27:03.377 --> 03:27:05.980
IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE.

03:27:06.046 --> 03:27:07.581
AND THAT'S TRUE IN SO MANY OTHER

03:27:07.648 --> 03:27:09.717
AREAS WHERE WE SHOULD TAKE CARE

03:27:09.784 --> 03:27:10.851
OF THE INTERVENTION OF THE

03:27:10.918 --> 03:27:13.053
PREVENTION EARLY ON SO THAT WE

03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:14.355

THIS WAS RELATED TO THE FEDERAL

ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE.

03:32:00.574 --> 03:32:02.309
THAT HAS BEEN OPERATED THROUGH

03:32:02.376 --> 03:32:04.478

03:32:11.318 --> 03:32:12.986
PROVISION WAS PASSED LAST YEAR

03:32:13.053 --> 03:32:15.189
THAT LAID OUT EXACTLY WHAT THOSE

03:32:15.255 --> 03:32:16.657
REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE IN TERMS

03:32:16.723 --> 03:32:18.158
OF WHAT WAS BEING MEASURED --

03:32:18.225 --> 03:32:19.760
HOW COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO COME

03:32:19.827 --> 03:32:21.328
INTO COMPLIANCE AND SO THAT WE

03:32:21.395 --> 03:32:23.197

LAST JULY WHEN WE ORIGINALLY DID

03:32:42.349 --> 03:32:44.184
THE NETWORK CERTIFICATION AND

03:32:44.251 --> 03:32:45.352
FOR THOSE THAT ARE THAT REMAIN

03:32:45.419 --> 03:32:47.154
OUT OF COMPLIANCE WE WILL BE

03:32:47.221 --> 03:32:49.656
SHORTLY ISSUING SANCTIONS --

03:32:49.723 --> 03:32:51.291
MONETARY SANCTIONS IN ORDER.

03:32:51.358 --> 03:32:52.659
TO CONTINUALLY EMPHASIZE THE

03:32:52.726 --> 03:32:54.027
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING HAVING

03:32:54.094 --> 03:32:55.028
ADEQUATE NETWORK.

03:32:55.095 --> 03:32:56.630
BUT SANCTIONS ARE ARE THINGS

03:32:56.697 --> 03:32:57.931

03:32:57.998 --> 03:32:59.299
MANAGED CARE SIDE SO AGAIN

03:32:59.366 --> 03:33:01.301
TRYING TO ALIGN THE SYSTEM TO BE

03:33:01.368 --> 03:33:03.170
MUCH MORE SIMILAR IN THE WAY

03:33:03.237 --> 03:33:04.538
THAT WE OVERSEE THEM.

03:33:04.605 --> 03:33:06.073
IN ADDITION TO THAT AS REQUIRED

03:33:06.140 --> 03:33:07.875
FEDERALLY WE HAVE AN EXTERNAL

LETTERS STAND FOR SARS DON'T

03:33:13.147 --> 03:33:15.983
HAVE TO LOOK IT UP --

03:33:16.049 --> 03:33:17.184
AND SO THAT COME TO MIND.

03:33:17.251 --> 03:33:18.318
WE ARE A LOT OF ACRONYMS IN THE

03:33:18.385 --> 03:33:20.154
MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR SURE --

03:33:20.220 --> 03:33:20.521
SO THE EAGER --

03:33:20.587 --> 03:33:23.724
WITH AN EXTERNAL REVIEW

03:33:23.790 --> 03:33:25.125
THESE CRITICAL ISSUES AGAIN OF

03:33:25.192 --> 03:33:26.760
ACCESS.

03:33:26.827 --> 03:33:28.395

COMPETENCY WHAT ARE THE QUALITY

03:33:30.164 --> 03:33:31.365
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT THE

COUNTIES ARE DOING SO THEY ARE

03:33:32.633 --> 03:33:33.934
INDEPENDENT FROM AUSTIN THAT

03:33:34.001 --> 03:33:35.269
THEY THEN GO OUT INTO THEIR OWN.

03:33:35.335 --> 03:33:36.870
ASSESSMENT OF THESE PARTICULAR

03:33:36.937 --> 03:33:38.505
ISSUES.

03:33:38.572 --> 03:33:40.974
AND THEN I WOULD SAY --

03:33:41.041 --> 03:33:42.209
THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS

03:33:42.276 --> 03:33:44.077
THAT WE ALSO JUST HAVE JUST OUR

03:33:44.144 --> 03:33:45.546

03:37:09.983 --> 03:37:11.718
WAS DEVELOPED WITH STAKEHOLDERS

03:37:11.785 --> 03:37:13.320
ARM AND ARE COUNTY PARTNERS --

03:37:13.387 --> 03:37:14.654
OUR PENETRATION RATE IS ONE OR

03:37:14.721 --> 03:37:15.956
MORE SERVICES IN OUR ENGAGEMENT

RATE IS FIVE OR MORE SERVICES

03:37:17.624 --> 03:37:19.593
THESE NUMBERS WERE DEVELOPED OUT

03:37:19.659 --> 03:37:20.827
THROUGH A QUITE A PROCESS

03:37:20.894 --> 03:37:22.229
LOOKING AT ARE DATED AND FIGURE

03:37:22.295 --> 03:37:23.730
OUT THE PROPER CUT OFFS --

03:37:23.797 --> 03:37:25.699
AND SO IT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND

03:37:25.766 --> 03:37:27.300
OUR POPULATION TO UNDERSTAND

03:37:27.367 --> 03:37:28.902
WHO'S COMING INTO THE SYSTEM AND

03:37:28.969 --> 03:37:30.303
WHO'S STAYING IN OUR SYSTEM --

03:37:30.370 --> 03:37:32.406
WE ALSO PROVIDES DATA ON THE

03:37:32.472 --> 03:37:33.607
TYPES OF SERVICES THAT PEOPLE

03:37:33.673 --> 03:37:34.941
ARE UTILIZING AND HOW MUCH OF

03:37:35.008 --> 03:37:35.976
THE CERTAIN THE STRUGGLE

03:37:36.042 --> 03:37:37.744
SERVICES THERE UTILIZING AS WELL

03:37:37.811 --> 03:37:39.379
AS THE COST FOR THOSE SERVICES.

03:37:39.446 --> 03:37:40.013
AND THEN --

03:37:40.080 --> 03:37:46.219
WHAT WE DO AT THIS POINT HAVE --

03:37:46.286 --> 03:37:46.853
ONE HE JUST MEASURE AND I DON'T

03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:50.457
HAVE A TIME FOR FOLLOW UP AFTER

03:37:50.524 --> 03:37:51.391
SOMEBODY'S --

03:37:51.458 --> 03:37:52.626
HOSPITALIZED WHETHER BE A CHILD

03:37:52.692 --> 03:37:55.862
ARE YOU OR ADULTS OR OLDER ADULT

03:37:55.929 --> 03:37:57.697
AND WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD OUT

03:37:57.764 --> 03:37:58.999
OUR DASH FOR WE'RE CONTINUOUSLY

03:37:59.065 --> 03:38:00.567
KIND OF ITS OWN --

03:38:00.634 --> 03:38:01.768
WORKING PARTNERS WERE

03:38:01.835 --> 03:38:03.003
CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING OUR

03:38:03.069 --> 03:38:04.104
DASHBOARDS --

03:38:04.171 --> 03:38:06.306
AS WE GET MORE DATA AS WE

03:38:06.373 --> 03:38:07.908
IMPROVE OUR DATA QUALITY WERE

03:38:07.974 --> 03:38:10.477
PUBLISHING DATA EVERY YEAR SO I

03:38:10.544 --> 03:38:12.112
WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD OUT THOSE --

03:38:12.179 --> 03:38:13.613
THOSE DASHBOARDS --

03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:14.748
AND WE ALSO --

03:38:14.815 --> 03:38:16.082
COLLECT CONSUMER PERCEPTION

03:38:16.149 --> 03:38:17.851
SURVEY FROM --

03:38:17.918 --> 03:38:19.252
SERVICE FROM MARK --

03:38:19.319 --> 03:38:19.920
THE PEOPLE WHO WE PROVIDE

03:38:19.986 --> 03:38:21.321
SERVICES TO WE'VE BEEN DOING

03:38:21.388 --> 03:38:22.255
THAT SINCE THE EARLY TWO

03:38:22.322 --> 03:38:23.957
THOUSANDS AND WE DO THAT TWICE A

03:38:24.024 --> 03:38:28.094
YEAR AND WE ALSO PUBLISH THAT

03:38:28.161 --> 03:38:30.864
DATE ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL.

03:38:30.931 --> 03:38:32.032
I THINK WE ADDRESS SORT OF THE

03:38:32.098 --> 03:38:33.066
MAIN THINGS THAT WERE FOCUSED AS

03:38:33.133 --> 03:38:34.134
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE COUNTY

03:38:34.201 --> 03:38:35.235
PARTNERS OBVIOUSLY HAVE

03:38:35.302 --> 03:38:36.403
ADDITIONAL THINGS I'M SURE THEY

03:38:36.470 --> 03:38:37.671
WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU RIGHT I

03:38:37.737 --> 03:38:38.872
THINK THAT YOU'VE COVERED MANY

03:38:38.939 --> 03:38:40.674
THE EQ ARE --

03:38:40.740 --> 03:38:43.677
AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS I THINK --

03:38:43.743 --> 03:38:45.378
YOU KNOW THE NETWORK ADEQUACY

03:38:45.445 --> 03:38:47.047
TOOL THAT WERE ALL COMPLETED I

03:38:47.113 --> 03:38:48.181
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO

03:38:48.248 --> 03:38:50.283
UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO OF A WORK

03:38:50.350 --> 03:38:51.551
FOR SHORTAGE OF OUR FIELD ACROSS

03:38:51.618 --> 03:38:52.786
CALIFORNIA.

03:38:52.853 --> 03:38:54.254
EVEN IN LARGE COUNTIES IT

03:38:54.321 --> 03:38:55.822
DOESN'T MATTER --

03:38:55.889 --> 03:38:58.258
AND SO IT'S VERY CHALLENGING AND

03:38:58.325 --> 03:38:59.593
I THINK THE COUNTIES WORKING

03:38:59.659 --> 03:39:00.927
WITH DH CS.

03:39:00.994 --> 03:39:03.330
ARE REALLY LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE

03:39:03.396 --> 03:39:04.865
BRING IN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

03:39:04.931 --> 03:39:05.999
STAFF.

03:39:06.066 --> 03:39:08.134
BECAUSE WE NEED FOR THE EVIDENCE

03:39:08.201 --> 03:39:09.336
BASED.

03:39:09.402 --> 03:39:10.604
ALL THE EVIDENCE FACE WORKING

03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:12.939
FOR A PSYCHIATRIST THOSE ARE

03:39:13.006 --> 03:39:14.541
LIKE JEWELS IN THE CROWN WE WANT

03:39:14.608 --> 03:39:15.809
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHETHER THEIR

03:39:15.876 --> 03:39:17.143
CONTRACT AGENCIES ARE COUNTY

03:39:17.210 --> 03:39:18.512
OPERATED.

03:39:18.578 --> 03:39:19.379
THAT WERE USING THE CLINICAL

03:39:19.446 --> 03:39:21.848
STAFF OF THE APPROACH BUT THERE

03:39:21.915 --> 03:39:23.183
IS A SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA

03:39:23.250 --> 03:39:24.618
THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF EFFORTS

03:39:24.684 --> 03:39:26.786
MADE ON THIS I'M FOR MANY YEARS

03:39:26.853 --> 03:39:29.189
SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE MHSAA.

03:39:29.256 --> 03:39:30.624
BUT IT DOES MAKE THE NETWORK

03:39:30.690 --> 03:39:32.025
ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS VERY

03:39:32.092 --> 03:39:33.460
CHALLENGING FOR MANY OF THE

03:39:33.527 --> 03:39:34.461
COUNTIES --

03:39:34.528 --> 03:39:36.263
TELEHEALTH WILL BE MOVING

03:39:36.329 --> 03:39:37.831
TOWARDS TELEHEALTH AT ALL THAT.

03:39:37.898 --> 03:39:39.332
I THINK A COUPLE OF MY OTHER U.

03:39:39.399 --> 03:39:40.333
S. M. --

03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:43.670
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT --

03:39:43.737 --> 03:39:45.272
DO WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING IN

03:39:45.338 --> 03:39:46.573
THE COUNTY AND I THINK THAT'S A

03:39:46.640 --> 03:39:48.074
DIFFICULT THING TO ANSWER.

03:39:48.141 --> 03:39:49.509
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M A QUICK TO

03:39:49.576 --> 03:39:51.211
SAY THIS IS THE SITUATION FOR

03:39:51.278 --> 03:39:53.580
ALL COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA.

03:39:53.647 --> 03:39:55.248
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S

03:39:55.315 --> 03:39:57.784
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT.

03:39:57.851 --> 03:40:00.320
THE COUNTIES BASED ON SLICE

03:40:00.387 --> 03:40:01.922
OFTEN -- IN

03:40:01.988 --> 03:40:03.790
A LARGER COUNTIES HAVE MORE MORE

03:40:03.857 --> 03:40:05.358
REVENUE OFF AND THEN THE SMALLER

03:40:05.425 --> 03:40:07.327
COUNTIES SO I THINK WE IF YOU

03:40:07.394 --> 03:40:08.762
WERE TO LOOK ACROSS THE STATE

03:40:08.828 --> 03:40:09.963
YOU MIGHT HEAR FROM SOME

03:40:10.030 --> 03:40:12.766
COUNTIES WE NEED MORE FUNDING.

03:40:12.832 --> 03:40:15.135
AND I THINK FROM THE LARGER

03:40:15.201 --> 03:40:16.570
COUNTIES I THINK MAYBE WE ARE

03:40:16.636 --> 03:40:18.004
ALWAYS ASKING FOR MANY AT ALL

03:40:18.071 --> 03:40:19.806
THE COUNTIES BUT QUITE HONESTLY

03:40:19.873 --> 03:40:20.974
I THINK FOR MANY OF US IN THE

03:40:21.041 --> 03:40:22.442
LARGER COUNTIES WE HAVE OTHER

03:40:22.509 --> 03:40:23.944
FUNDING STREAMS AS WELL.

03:40:24.010 --> 03:40:25.312
SO I DON'T FEEL PREPARED TO

03:40:25.378 --> 03:40:27.013
REPRESENT ALL THE COUNTIES IN

03:40:27.080 --> 03:40:33.453
CALIFORNIA MR SUFFICIENT FUNDING --

03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:34.454
I THINK THE THE OTHER THING THAT

03:40:34.521 --> 03:40:35.088
WE'D LIKE TO SEE RIGHT NOW WE'RE

03:40:35.155 --> 03:40:36.823
LOOKING AT ACCESS WHICH WE NEED

03:40:36.890 --> 03:40:39.059
TO BE LOOKING AT BUT IT'S ALSO

03:40:39.125 --> 03:40:41.127
HOW CAN WE MOVE THIS SOME I KNOW

03:40:41.194 --> 03:40:41.561
THAT'S THE INCENTIVE

03:40:41.628 --> 03:40:42.929
CONVERSATION.

03:40:42.996 --> 03:40:44.831
BUT HOW COOLEY MOVE THIS FORWARD

03:40:44.898 --> 03:40:46.499
NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF ACCESS BUT

03:40:46.566 --> 03:40:48.001
WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS ON THE

03:40:48.068 --> 03:40:49.135
PEOPLE WE SERVE.

03:40:49.202 --> 03:40:51.171
LIKE ARE THEY DOING BETTER ARE

03:40:51.237 --> 03:40:52.539
THEY LIVING IN A HOUSE.

03:40:52.606 --> 03:40:56.710
ARE THEY NOT SYMPTOMATIC WHEN A

03:40:56.776 --> 03:40:57.644
LOOK WE WANT TO WORK FOR THE

03:40:57.711 --> 03:40:59.746
DEPARTMENT A GREAT DEAL ON

03:40:59.813 --> 03:41:01.381
REALLY MEASURING NEED AND ALSO

03:41:01.448 --> 03:41:03.350
MEASURING OUTCOMES FOR THE

03:41:03.416 --> 03:41:06.019
PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE --

03:41:06.086 --> 03:41:07.887
AND I JUST THINK THE OTHER THING

03:41:07.954 --> 03:41:10.991
IS OUR FUNDING IS VERY COMPLEX

03:41:11.057 --> 03:41:13.360
WE PRAYED SEVERAL FUND FUNDING

03:41:13.426 --> 03:41:14.995
SOURCES EVERY COUNTY ASKED TO DO

03:41:15.061 --> 03:41:16.229
THIS.

03:41:16.296 --> 03:41:17.964
AND I KNOW THAT SEE BEACH DA IS

03:41:18.031 --> 03:41:19.432
VERY INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH

03:41:19.499 --> 03:41:20.834
THE DEPARTMENT.

03:41:20.900 --> 03:41:23.236
ON LOOKING AT SORT OF BILLING

03:41:23.303 --> 03:41:25.271
AND PAYMENT REFORM TO MAKE IT

03:41:25.338 --> 03:41:27.440
MUCH EASIER. TO JUST GIVE YOU A

03:41:27.507 --> 03:41:29.576
SMALL EXAMPLE I KNOW IT'S LATE

03:41:29.643 --> 03:41:34.014
AND PEOPLE ARE TIRED BUT WE

03:41:34.080 --> 03:41:35.582
BUILD BY THE MIDDLE.

03:41:35.649 --> 03:41:36.783
WE BILLED BY THE MINUTE AND CAN

03:41:36.850 --> 03:41:37.150
YOU IMAGINE --

03:41:37.217 --> 03:41:39.319
DOCUMENTING BY THE MINUTE IN

03:41:39.386 --> 03:41:41.454
ORDER TO GET PAID THAT'S A LONG

03:41:41.521 --> 03:41:42.989
STANDING PRACTICE WITH OUR SHORT

03:41:43.056 --> 03:41:43.990
DIAL MEDI CAL.

03:41:44.057 --> 03:41:46.326
SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL

03:41:46.393 --> 03:41:47.694
OPPORTUNITY WITH THE WAY FIRST I

03:41:47.761 --> 03:41:50.263
MEAN TOTALLY FOR US TO RETHINK

03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:52.165
THIS WORKING AND I ALSO THINK

03:41:52.232 --> 03:41:54.134
GOING FORWARD INTO THE WAY

03:41:54.200 --> 03:41:55.468
PERSON TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT

03:41:55.535 --> 03:41:56.503
SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

03:41:56.569 --> 03:41:58.438
THE LAST THING I DO WANT TO SAY

03:41:58.505 --> 03:41:59.539
ABOUT MILD TO MODERATE.

03:41:59.606 --> 03:42:01.141
AND BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF THE

03:42:01.207 --> 03:42:02.809
QUESTIONS FOR THE COUNTIES --

03:42:02.876 --> 03:42:04.277
THE MILD MODERATE TO THESE ARE

03:42:04.344 --> 03:42:05.712
INDIVIDUALS THAT MIGHT BE HAVING

03:42:05.779 --> 03:42:07.714
ANXIETY THEY MAY NEED TO TALK TO

03:42:07.781 --> 03:42:09.249
A THERAPIST FOR A SHORT PERIOD

03:42:09.315 --> 03:42:11.818
OF TIME OR THEY MAY NEED.

03:42:11.885 --> 03:42:16.289
MORE CARE THAN JUST BEYOND THAT

03:42:16.356 --> 03:42:19.059
MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE

03:42:19.125 --> 03:42:21.161
CONTRACT WITH US TO THE CONTRACT

03:42:21.227 --> 03:42:23.029
WITH INDEPENDENT PROVIDERS AND

03:42:23.096 --> 03:42:25.098
IT DOES BECOME VERY COMPLICATED

03:42:25.165 --> 03:42:26.466
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT.

03:42:26.533 --> 03:42:28.868
INTEGRATED CARE FULLY INTEGRATED

03:42:28.935 --> 03:42:31.504
CARE AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE

03:42:31.571 --> 03:42:33.039
WOULD LIKE TO SEE AT LEAST IN

03:42:33.106 --> 03:42:34.574
OUR COUNTY IS COULD WE TRY TO

03:42:34.641 --> 03:42:36.976
PILOTS THAT HOLD CONTINUE ON AND

03:42:37.043 --> 03:42:38.645
REALLY MANAGE PEOPLE FROM MILD

03:42:38.712 --> 03:42:39.846
TO MODERATE ALL THE WAY UP TO

03:42:39.913 --> 03:42:40.914
THE INTENSIVE.

03:42:40.980 --> 03:42:42.515
BECAUSE IF WE REALLY ARE LOOKING

03:42:42.582 --> 03:42:43.349
AT THE WHOLE BODY BEING

03:42:43.416 --> 03:42:45.719
INTEGRATED IT'S IT IS BIFURCATED

03:42:45.785 --> 03:42:47.353
RIGHT NOW JUST IN TERMS OF THE

03:42:47.420 --> 03:42:50.190
PROCESS.

03:42:50.256 --> 03:42:51.324
SO I NEED TO SAY THAT

03:42:51.391 --> 03:42:51.624
[inaudible]

03:42:51.691 --> 03:42:53.626
THANK YOU.

03:42:53.693 --> 03:42:54.394
THANK YOU MENTOR MEMBERS TO BE

03:42:54.461 --> 03:42:55.829
DEALING WITH NOW COMMISSION SO --

03:42:55.895 --> 03:42:57.097
THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE WE'RE

03:42:57.163 --> 03:42:59.432
BIFURCATED IN TERMS OF THE ROLE

03:42:59.499 --> 03:43:00.967
OF THE DEPARTMENT OR OFF THE

03:43:01.034 --> 03:43:02.068
COMMISSION --

03:43:02.135 --> 03:43:04.137
UNDER THE LAW WE WRITE

03:43:04.204 --> 03:43:05.472
REGULATIONS --

03:43:05.538 --> 03:43:08.308
FOR TWO OF TWO OF THE FIVE

03:43:08.374 --> 03:43:09.209
COMPONENTS OF THE MILL HALL

03:43:09.275 --> 03:43:10.143
SERVICES ACT PRIMARILY

03:43:10.210 --> 03:43:11.277
PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION AND

03:43:11.344 --> 03:43:12.479
INNOVATION.

03:43:12.545 --> 03:43:14.080
AND SO GETTING AT THE QUESTION

03:43:14.147 --> 03:43:15.982
OF HOW DO WE TO THE MONITOR

03:43:16.049 --> 03:43:17.650
ACCESS ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH

03:43:17.717 --> 03:43:19.419
CARE -- A

03:43:19.486 --> 03:43:20.420
AND IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY TO THE

03:43:20.487 --> 03:43:22.322
SPECIAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE SIDE

03:43:22.388 --> 03:43:24.491
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

03:43:24.557 --> 03:43:26.159
IS HIS BEING SERVED TO WHICH

03:43:26.226 --> 03:43:27.827
PROGRAMS AND HOW AND WHEN AND

03:43:27.894 --> 03:43:29.028
WHERE ARE THEIR BREAKDOWNS BY

03:43:29.095 --> 03:43:31.264
RACE ETHNICITY AGE GENDER SEXUAL

03:43:31.331 --> 03:43:32.432
ORIENTATION.

03:43:32.499 --> 03:43:33.666
SO THE COMMISSION TO ITS

03:43:33.733 --> 03:43:34.601
REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAS

03:43:34.667 --> 03:43:36.202
ACTUALLY REQUIRED COUNTIES TO

03:43:36.269 --> 03:43:37.237
PROVIDE DATA.

03:43:37.303 --> 03:43:38.972
ON WHOSE ACTUALLY SERVED BY

03:43:39.038 --> 03:43:39.839
PROGRAM SO --

03:43:39.906 --> 03:43:41.274
TRACTOR TELL THESE MENTIONED

03:43:41.341 --> 03:43:42.909
THAT THEY DO THESE PLANS AND

03:43:42.976 --> 03:43:45.378
THOSE PLANS ARE PROJECTIONS OF

03:43:45.445 --> 03:43:47.113
WHAT WHO THEY INTEND TO SERVE

03:43:47.180 --> 03:43:48.381
AND HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'LL

03:43:48.448 --> 03:43:50.083
INVEST IN THOSE PROGRAMS.

03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:52.152
ARE INTENSE WEDNESDAY'S DATA

03:43:52.218 --> 03:43:53.019
COME IN AS TO BE IS TO ACTUALLY

03:43:53.086 --> 03:43:55.155
MAKE PUBLIC WHO ACTUALLY HAS

03:43:55.221 --> 03:43:55.822
BEEN SERVED.

03:43:55.889 --> 03:43:57.857
SO BUT IT'S LIMITED ONLY TO

03:43:57.924 --> 03:43:58.691
PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND

03:43:58.758 --> 03:44:00.326
INNOVATION PROGRAMS BECAUSE

03:44:00.393 --> 03:44:01.594
THAT'S THE EXTENT OF AUTHORITY.

03:44:01.661 --> 03:44:02.195
THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

03:44:02.262 --> 03:44:04.564
SERVICES FOR HAS THE REST OF THE

03:44:04.631 --> 03:44:06.199
YOU KNOW THE THE PIE CHART SO TO

03:44:06.266 --> 03:44:08.568
SPEAK -- BUT

03:44:08.635 --> 03:44:11.471
THE QUESTION IS REALLY ONE OF

03:44:11.538 --> 03:44:12.806
THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE LAW AND

03:44:12.872 --> 03:44:15.208
SO WE WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T

03:44:15.275 --> 03:44:17.243
ACTUALLY TELL YOU OR REPORT OUT

03:44:17.310 --> 03:44:18.611
TO THE PUBLIC OF WHETHER OR NOT

03:44:18.678 --> 03:44:20.146
WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.

03:44:20.213 --> 03:44:21.881
AROUND NOT JUST ACCESS TO CARE

03:44:21.948 --> 03:44:23.416
FOR THE QUALITY OF THAT CARE

03:44:23.483 --> 03:44:25.418
UNLESS WE CAN UNDERSTAND FIRST

03:44:25.485 --> 03:44:26.986
HIS HIS WALKING IN FRONT DOOR.

03:44:27.053 --> 03:44:28.254
AND SO THAT'S THE DEMOGRAPHIC

03:44:28.321 --> 03:44:29.656
REPORTING PIECE THAT WE HOPE THE

03:44:29.722 --> 03:44:30.890
BILL TO GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE

03:44:30.957 --> 03:44:32.458
OF WHO IS ACTUALLY BEING SERVED

03:44:32.525 --> 03:44:34.360
BUT ALSO WHAT ARE THOSE OUTCOMES

03:44:34.427 --> 03:44:36.296
ON ON THE BACKEND AND SO UNDER

03:44:36.362 --> 03:44:38.865
THE LAW AS SPECIFIED UNDER.

03:44:38.932 --> 03:44:41.201
THE MEN HOW SERVICES ACT IT SAYS

03:44:41.267 --> 03:44:42.302
REDUCE SCHOOL FAILURE REDUCE

03:44:42.368 --> 03:44:43.736
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS CRIMINAL

03:44:43.803 --> 03:44:45.972
JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT REDUCE.

03:44:46.039 --> 03:44:46.973
CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT

03:44:47.040 --> 03:44:48.374
SUICIDE HOMELESSNESS AND AND

03:44:48.441 --> 03:44:50.944
THEN THIS THIS GRANT PROLONGED

03:44:51.010 --> 03:44:51.845
SUFFERING AND SO.

03:44:51.911 --> 03:44:52.478
WE HAVE SEVERAL PROJECTS UNDER

03:44:52.545 --> 03:44:54.147
WAY TO LINK MENTAL HEALTH DATA

03:44:54.214 --> 03:44:55.715
WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA FOR

03:44:55.782 --> 03:44:57.350
EXAMPLE TO ACTUALLY GIVE YOUR

03:44:57.417 --> 03:44:59.219
PROFILE BY COUNTIES OF HOW MANY

03:44:59.285 --> 03:45:00.753
PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE ACTUALLY

03:45:00.820 --> 03:45:02.522
ACCESSING OUR PUBLIC SERVICES

03:45:02.589 --> 03:45:04.157
THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:45:04.224 --> 03:45:05.024
BECAUSE THAT NUMBER NEEDS TO

03:45:05.091 --> 03:45:05.692
COME DOWN.

03:45:05.758 --> 03:45:07.460
RIGHT AND IN PART OF OUR

03:45:07.527 --> 03:45:09.429
CHALLENGE QUITE FRANKLY IS

03:45:09.495 --> 03:45:10.463
NGUYEN AT LEAST WHEN THE

03:45:10.530 --> 03:45:11.598
COMMISSION THINKS ABOUT

03:45:11.664 --> 03:45:12.899
PREVENTION OR INTERVENTION WE'RE

03:45:12.966 --> 03:45:14.367
THINKING MARTHA POPULATION

03:45:14.434 --> 03:45:16.135
HEALTH LEVEL.

03:45:16.202 --> 03:45:17.904
NOT BASED ON THE FUNDING STREAM.

03:45:17.971 --> 03:45:20.473
RIGHT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY HOW DO

03:45:20.540 --> 03:45:21.808
WE ACTUALLY REDUCE CRIMINAL

03:45:21.875 --> 03:45:23.977
JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT INDEPENDENT

03:45:24.043 --> 03:45:24.611
OF WHETHER NOT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE

03:45:24.677 --> 03:45:26.246
FOR AND I'M HERE IN THE MEDICAID

03:45:26.312 --> 03:45:27.046
MANAGED.

03:45:27.113 --> 03:45:28.681
MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM OR

03:45:28.748 --> 03:45:30.049
THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM OR

03:45:30.116 --> 03:45:31.918
THE COMMERCIAL PLAN OR NOT

03:45:31.985 --> 03:45:33.186
INSURED AT ALL THE MENTAL HEALTH

03:45:33.253 --> 03:45:35.822
SERVICES ACT IS VERY BROAD AND

03:45:35.889 --> 03:45:37.357
IT AND IT REALLY TALKS ABOUT.

03:45:37.423 --> 03:45:39.092
BROAD POPULATION LEVEL ISSUES

03:45:39.158 --> 03:45:40.960
NOT BASED ON HIS ELIGIBLE FOR A

03:45:41.027 --> 03:45:42.195
FUNDING STREAM.

03:45:42.262 --> 03:45:44.530
SO WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

03:45:44.597 --> 03:45:46.866
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW CAN WE

03:45:46.933 --> 03:45:49.636
ACCESS EXISTING DATA AND BEGIN

03:45:49.702 --> 03:45:50.904
TO GIVE YOU SOME OF THOSE.

03:45:50.970 --> 03:45:51.771
IN THE CORE INFORMATION THAT

03:45:51.838 --> 03:45:54.407
THAT THAT MY COMMISSIONS WANNA

03:45:54.474 --> 03:45:56.042
KNOW.

03:45:56.109 --> 03:45:58.711
OUR CHILDREN ADULTS SAFE ARE

03:45:58.778 --> 03:45:59.345
THEY HOUSE THAT THEY WORKING OF

03:45:59.412 --> 03:46:01.981
THE SEATING YOU KNOW THOSE THIS

03:46:02.048 --> 03:46:03.416
THIS CORE ISSUES AND THEN B

03:46:03.483 --> 03:46:04.817
ABLE TO DRILL DOWN UNDERNEATH

03:46:04.884 --> 03:46:06.519
THAT WHAT KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS

03:46:06.586 --> 03:46:07.921
WHAT KINDS OF PROGRAMS.

03:46:07.987 --> 03:46:10.290
ARE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE AT

03:46:10.356 --> 03:46:11.591
ACHIEVING THOSE OUTCOMES.

03:46:11.658 --> 03:46:13.326
I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE STATE HAS

03:46:13.393 --> 03:46:14.527
THE TECHNOLOGY THE

03:46:14.594 --> 03:46:16.195
INFRASTRUCTURE THE DATA AND THE

03:46:16.262 --> 03:46:18.164
AND THE THE ABILITY TO ANSWER

03:46:18.231 --> 03:46:19.699
THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN I ANSWERING

03:46:19.766 --> 03:46:20.967
THEM NOW WE ALSO HAVE THE

03:46:21.034 --> 03:46:22.402
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE

03:46:22.468 --> 03:46:23.102
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE

03:46:23.169 --> 03:46:24.137
INCENTIVES.

03:46:24.203 --> 03:46:25.438
AND THE GUIDANCE TO ACTUALLY

03:46:25.505 --> 03:46:26.940
HELP COUNTIES TO YOU KNOW

03:46:27.006 --> 03:46:27.974
HIGHLIGHT WHERE THERE'S

03:46:28.041 --> 03:46:30.276
EXCELLENCE HIGHLIGHT WHERE THERE

03:46:30.343 --> 03:46:32.278
ARE SOME CHALLENGES AND AND MOVE

03:46:32.345 --> 03:46:33.546
DOLLARS MOVE STRATEGIES MOVE

03:46:33.613 --> 03:46:35.181
PROGRAMS FROM.

03:46:35.248 --> 03:46:35.915
LESS EFFECTIVE TOMORROW

03:46:35.982 --> 03:46:38.718
EFFECTIVE KINDS OF APPROACHES.

03:46:38.785 --> 03:46:41.487
IN TERMS OF THE SUFFICIENT PEACE

03:46:41.554 --> 03:46:44.223
AMID TO SAY 25% OF THE MONEY.

03:46:44.290 --> 03:46:45.892
OF THE OF THE FOUR PRIMARY

03:46:45.959 --> 03:46:47.360
CATEGORIES OF FUNDS AND ME TO

03:46:47.427 --> 03:46:48.962
SAY THE PAPER ALL SUB ACCOUNT

03:46:49.028 --> 03:46:51.064
REALIGNMENT FROM NINETEEN NINETY

03:46:51.130 --> 03:46:51.731
ONE AND THE FOURTH IS THE MEDI

03:46:51.798 --> 03:46:52.865
CAL DRIVE DOWN THE MEDICAL

03:46:52.932 --> 03:46:53.733
DROUGHT AND THE ONLY ONE THAT

03:46:53.800 --> 03:46:54.834
ACTUALLY COUNTIES IN THE STATE

03:46:54.901 --> 03:46:56.436
HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER HOW MUCH.

03:46:56.502 --> 03:46:57.003
MONEY EVERYTHING ELSE IS A

03:46:57.070 --> 03:46:59.739
FORMULA BASED ON REVENUES SO WE

03:46:59.806 --> 03:47:01.708
CAN GET PEOPLE TO BUY MORE CARS

03:47:01.774 --> 03:47:03.109
AND AND THAT PAY MORE.

03:47:03.176 --> 03:47:05.511
YOU KNOW VEHICLE LICENSE FEES WE

03:47:05.578 --> 03:47:08.114
CAN GROW THOSE REVENUE STREAMS --

03:47:08.181 --> 03:47:09.949
BUT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT

03:47:10.016 --> 03:47:12.952
HOW CAN THE STATE MAXIMIZE THE

03:47:13.019 --> 03:47:15.088
BOTH THE DRAWDOWN OF ALL OF THE

03:47:15.154 --> 03:47:16.723
SOURCES OF FUNDS BUT BUT MORE

03:47:16.789 --> 03:47:19.192
IMPORTANTLY THE EFFICACY OF

03:47:19.258 --> 03:47:19.759
THOSE DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING

03:47:19.826 --> 03:47:20.693
DEPLOYED.

03:47:20.760 --> 03:47:23.196
LASTLY I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF

03:47:23.262 --> 03:47:25.298
THE QUESTION NUMBER --

03:47:25.365 --> 03:47:26.666
FIVE BECAUSE WE DON'T WE DON'T

03:47:26.733 --> 03:47:27.967
WORK WITH THAT WE KNOW WE THE

03:47:28.034 --> 03:47:28.935
OTHER QUESTIONS REALLY AREN'T TO

03:47:29.002 --> 03:47:30.103
TOWARDS THE DEPARTMENT IS IN

03:47:30.169 --> 03:47:31.204
TERMS OF PROP FIFTY THREE

03:47:31.270 --> 03:47:31.738
FUNDING.

03:47:31.804 --> 03:47:33.072
I WOULD SAY THERE ARE TWO

03:47:33.139 --> 03:47:35.108
FOUNDATIONAL IMPACTS THAT ARE

03:47:35.174 --> 03:47:37.377
VERY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE ONE

03:47:37.443 --> 03:47:38.678
IS A MANDATE FOR PREVENTION

03:47:38.745 --> 03:47:40.346
EARLY INTERVENTION THAT DOESN'T

03:47:40.413 --> 03:47:41.948
EXIST IN THE OTHER.

03:47:42.015 --> 03:47:42.782
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES FOR MENTAL

03:47:42.849 --> 03:47:44.684
HEALTH AND THAT'S THAT'S SO

03:47:44.751 --> 03:47:46.419
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY

03:47:46.486 --> 03:47:48.988
ALLOWS SANTA CLARA COUNTY CONTRA

03:47:49.055 --> 03:47:49.956
COSTA COUNTY.

03:47:50.023 --> 03:47:54.227
MENDOCINO COUNTY TO ACTUALLY FOR

03:47:54.293 --> 03:47:56.162
KINDS OF PROGRAMS.

03:47:56.229 --> 03:47:57.964
THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE

03:47:58.031 --> 03:47:59.832
INNOVATION FUNDS IT'S A 5% SET

03:47:59.899 --> 03:48:01.267
ASIDE IT COMES OUT TO ABOUT A

03:48:01.334 --> 03:48:02.301
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

03:48:02.368 --> 03:48:03.836
THAT THE COUNTIES RECEIVE.

03:48:03.903 --> 03:48:05.104
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT

03:48:05.171 --> 03:48:06.606
IS THAT IS THE LAW CREATES AN

03:48:06.672 --> 03:48:07.940
EXPECTATION THAT COUNTIES WILL

03:48:08.007 --> 03:48:09.342
IMPROVE.

03:48:09.409 --> 03:48:10.643
AND IT CREATES A REVENUE STREAM

03:48:10.710 --> 03:48:11.711
TO SUPPORT THAT IMPROVEMENT

03:48:11.778 --> 03:48:12.845
THROUGH INNOVATION.

03:48:12.912 --> 03:48:14.814
WE'RE DOING A LOT TO SUPPORT THE

03:48:14.881 --> 03:48:16.215
ABILITY OF COUNTY IS TO ACTUALLY

03:48:16.282 --> 03:48:17.650
DEPLOY THOSE DOLLARS IN WAYS

03:48:17.717 --> 03:48:18.951
THAT INNOVATION IMPROVED YOUR

03:48:19.018 --> 03:48:20.119
CORE PROGRAMS.

03:48:20.186 --> 03:48:22.221
BUT IT'S AN AREA THAT WE NEED TO

03:48:22.288 --> 03:48:23.623
INVEST MORE AND MORE TIME OR

03:48:23.689 --> 03:48:24.924
RESOURCES MORE STRATEGIES

03:48:24.991 --> 03:48:26.459
BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK CALIFORNIA

03:48:26.526 --> 03:48:27.593
HAS.

03:48:27.660 --> 03:48:28.961
THE EXPERTISE THE KNOWLEDGE THE

03:48:29.028 --> 03:48:31.030
CAPACITY TO REALLY KNOCK IT OUT

03:48:31.097 --> 03:48:31.631
OF THE PARK WHEN IT COMES TO

03:48:31.697 --> 03:48:32.265
INNOVATION.

03:48:32.331 --> 03:48:34.000
BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET

03:48:34.067 --> 03:48:35.701
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SOME

03:48:35.768 --> 03:48:38.204
GOOD AND UNDERSTANDABLE SOME NOT

03:48:38.271 --> 03:48:38.905
SO GOOD AND NOT SO

03:48:38.971 --> 03:48:40.406
UNDERSTANDABLE --

03:48:40.473 --> 03:48:41.941

03:49:40.666 --> 03:49:41.601

SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE OF

03:49:56.115 --> 03:49:58.251
PSYCHOSOCIAL MODELS TO PROVIDE

03:49:58.317 --> 03:49:59.085
THE SERVICES.

03:49:59.152 --> 03:50:00.286
I THINK THERE'S THERE HAVE BEEN

03:50:00.353 --> 03:50:01.954
QUESTIONS THE ROUTE ABOUT SORT

03:50:02.021 --> 03:50:03.890
OF THE THE COMPARISONS WITH THE

03:50:03.956 --> 03:50:05.691
DD SYSTEM AND WE'VE CERTAINLY

03:50:05.758 --> 03:50:07.627
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AS WELL --

03:50:07.693 --> 03:50:09.896
IN THE SENSE THAT PART OF WHAT

03:50:09.962 --> 03:50:11.097
RAY THINK THE TENSION IS HERE

03:50:11.164 --> 03:50:12.165
WHAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH HIS

03:50:12.231 --> 03:50:14.000
WERE TRYING TO OVERLAY A MEDICAL

03:50:14.066 --> 03:50:15.701
MODEL ON TOP OF SOMETHING THAT

03:50:15.768 --> 03:50:17.236
IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT.

03:50:17.303 --> 03:50:18.304
AND THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE

03:50:18.371 --> 03:50:19.639
DRAWN FROM THE DD MODEL IN THE

03:50:19.705 --> 03:50:21.274
SENSE THAT WITH THIS COMMUNITY

03:50:21.340 --> 03:50:22.608
THERE WILL BE INDIVIDUALS WHO

03:50:22.675 --> 03:50:24.010
WILL BE WITH US.

03:50:24.076 --> 03:50:25.044
FROM WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTY BEEN

03:50:25.111 --> 03:50:26.212
HUMANS ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO

03:50:26.279 --> 03:50:28.481
THEIR END OF LIFE AND SO --

03:50:28.548 --> 03:50:30.316
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO SEE

03:50:30.383 --> 03:50:31.384
WHERE THERE ARE SIMILARITIES

03:50:31.450 --> 03:50:33.219
THERE AND WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS

03:50:33.286 --> 03:50:34.720
ABOUT --

03:50:34.787 --> 03:50:36.756
TRYING TO OVER SIMPLIFY THINGS

03:50:36.822 --> 03:50:38.457
CONCEPTS SUCH AS NETWORK

03:50:38.524 --> 03:50:40.092
ADEQUACY YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE

03:50:40.159 --> 03:50:41.594
WHO'S EVER HAD TO SEEK OUT OF

03:50:41.661 --> 03:50:44.363
THERAPY YOU KNOW THAT IT'S NOT

03:50:44.430 --> 03:50:45.331
AS SIMPLE AS WHEN YOU GO.

03:50:45.398 --> 03:50:46.799
TO SEE A DOCTOR AND OR OR YOU

03:50:46.866 --> 03:50:48.634
KNOW AT AND OR OR ORTHOPEDIC

03:50:48.701 --> 03:50:49.101
SURGEON --

03:50:49.168 --> 03:50:52.071
YOU KNOW WHOMEVER YOU JUST WANT

03:50:52.138 --> 03:50:53.639
SOME --

03:50:53.706 --> 03:50:56.242
SEEKING MEANT AT CONNECTS

03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.542
[inaudible]

03:50:56.609 --> 03:50:59.812
DAYS IN WEEKS THAT OUR WORKERS

03:50:59.879 --> 03:51:01.981
SPEND CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE AND

03:51:02.048 --> 03:51:03.416
GETTING THEM TO TRUST THEM AND

03:51:03.482 --> 03:51:04.483
HAVING THAT REAL HUMAN

03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:05.618
CONNECTION.

03:51:05.685 --> 03:51:06.719
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN

03:51:06.786 --> 03:51:07.987
MEASURE WITH TIME OR DISTANCE

03:51:08.054 --> 03:51:09.589
STANDARDS AND SO WE WOULD JUST

03:51:09.655 --> 03:51:12.391
SORT OF URGE SOME CAUTION IN HOW

03:51:12.458 --> 03:51:14.026
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT OF

03:51:14.093 --> 03:51:15.695
COMPARING THE TWO MODELS.

03:51:15.761 --> 03:51:16.362
THE OTHER THING THAT'S

03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:18.231
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT

03:51:18.297 --> 03:51:19.665
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IS.

03:51:19.732 --> 03:51:21.033
UNLIKE THE MEDICAL MODEL WE

03:51:21.100 --> 03:51:24.036
DON'T HAVE THESE REALLY BIG LONG

03:51:24.103 --> 03:51:25.371
STANDING ORGAN DATE

03:51:25.438 --> 03:51:26.706
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE

03:51:26.772 --> 03:51:28.441
DEVELOPED THESE REALLY INTRICATE

03:51:28.507 --> 03:51:30.042
QUALITY MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS YOU

03:51:30.109 --> 03:51:30.476
KNOW.

03:51:30.543 --> 03:51:32.211
AND SO YOU KNOW ON HEALTH CARE

03:51:32.278 --> 03:51:34.480
SAID YOU SEE CMS IN THE DO

03:51:34.547 --> 03:51:35.915
READMISSIONS PENALTIES WERE THE

03:51:35.982 --> 03:51:37.283
THING YOU FINANCIALLY IF

03:51:37.350 --> 03:51:38.351
SOMEBODY COMES OUT OF THE

03:51:38.417 --> 03:51:39.685
HOSPITAL GOES RIGHT BACK IN.

03:51:39.752 --> 03:51:42.622
BUT IN ADDICTION RECOVERY.

03:51:42.688 --> 03:51:45.858
RELAPSE IS A PART OF THE PROCESS

03:51:45.925 --> 03:51:48.127
AND SO THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD

03:51:48.194 --> 03:51:49.362
THINK ABOUT DOING IN SOMEBODY

03:51:49.428 --> 03:51:50.596
BECAUSE SOMEONE RELAPSE THAT

03:51:50.663 --> 03:51:52.565
MEANS POTENTIALLY THAT THEY'RE

03:51:52.632 --> 03:51:54.233
GETTING BETTER RIGHT SO.

03:51:54.300 --> 03:51:55.735
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WERE

03:51:55.801 --> 03:51:58.004
YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT WE NEED

03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:59.372
TO BE CAUTIOUS AND WE NEED TO

03:51:59.438 --> 03:52:01.440
TAKE A STEP BACK MAYBE AND THINK

03:52:01.507 --> 03:52:03.809
ABOUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED WHICH

03:52:03.876 --> 03:52:05.411
IS BACK PROVIDER LEVEL

03:52:05.478 --> 03:52:06.545
INTEGRATION.

03:52:06.612 --> 03:52:08.581
WHEN OUR WORKERS ARE TRYING TO

03:52:08.648 --> 03:52:11.651
FIND PLACEMENTS FOR FOLKS TO DAY?

03:52:11.717 --> 03:52:12.752
THEY HAVE.

03:52:12.818 --> 03:52:14.420
OWNED SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY

03:52:14.487 --> 03:52:16.656
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOTH

03:52:16.722 --> 03:52:18.524
PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:52:18.591 --> 03:52:21.994
NEEDS SO THE DIABETIC WHO NEEDS

03:52:22.061 --> 03:52:23.529
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT.

03:52:23.596 --> 03:52:25.398
THE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT

03:52:25.464 --> 03:52:26.399
PROVIDER CAN'T DEAL WITH THE DAY.

03:52:26.465 --> 03:52:30.202
THE INPATIENT HOSPITAL BED.

03:52:30.269 --> 03:52:30.770
THEY DON'T DEAL WITH THE YOU

03:52:30.836 --> 03:52:31.771
KNOW.

03:52:31.837 --> 03:52:32.938
SOCIAL EMOTIONAL THEY DON'T DO

03:52:33.005 --> 03:52:34.874
THE DECK ADDICTION STUFF AND SO

03:52:34.940 --> 03:52:36.442
THEY'RE REALLY ALWAYS STRUGGLING

03:52:36.509 --> 03:52:37.343
TO FIND.

03:52:37.410 --> 03:52:38.778
WHAT WHERE CAN I FIND SOMETHING

03:52:38.844 --> 03:52:40.079
AND IF WE THINK IT'S BETTER ON

03:52:40.146 --> 03:52:40.980
THE COMMERCIAL SIDE BECAUSE

03:52:41.047 --> 03:52:42.415
THERE WAS A LINE IN THE AGENDA

03:52:42.481 --> 03:52:43.382
THAT TALKED ABOUT THE FEDERAL

03:52:43.449 --> 03:52:45.351
RULES? TO MAKE SURE TO IT'S AS

03:52:45.418 --> 03:52:47.019
GOOD AS THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEM.

03:52:47.086 --> 03:52:48.054
IT'S NOT BETTER IN THE

03:52:48.120 --> 03:52:49.855
COMMERCIAL SYSTEM IT'S OFTEN

03:52:49.922 --> 03:52:51.390
WORSEN THE KERR COMMERCIAL

03:52:51.457 --> 03:52:53.559
SYSTEM OUR FOLKS ARE HAPPY WHEN

03:52:53.626 --> 03:52:55.127
SOMEONE QUALIFIES FOR MEDI CAL

03:52:55.194 --> 03:52:56.962
BECAUSE THE BENEFITS THERE ARE

03:52:57.029 --> 03:52:59.732
SO MUCH BETTER CAN BE MUCH

03:52:59.799 --> 03:53:01.167
BETTER THERE AS WELL.

03:53:01.233 --> 03:53:03.069
AND SO YOU KNOW THE OTHER

03:53:03.135 --> 03:53:04.737
FILTERING OUT THE PROVIDERS DO

03:53:04.804 --> 03:53:06.238
AGAIN WHEN WE CAN GET OVER THE

03:53:06.305 --> 03:53:07.573
NIMBY HURDLES WHEN WE CAN

03:53:07.640 --> 03:53:09.108
ACTUALLY SITE PROVIDERS.

03:53:09.175 --> 03:53:10.576
YOU KNOW THEY'LL SAY WE DON'T

03:53:10.643 --> 03:53:11.677
TAKE SOMEBODYWHO'S A SEX

03:53:11.744 --> 03:53:13.045
OFFENDER WE DON'T TAKE SOMEONE

03:53:13.112 --> 03:53:14.747
WITH AN ARSON CONVICTION WELL

03:53:14.814 --> 03:53:16.615
AGAIN WHO DO WE THINK WE'RE

03:53:16.682 --> 03:53:18.284
GOING TO BE TRYING TO SERVE IF

03:53:18.351 --> 03:53:19.185
WE'RE GOING.

03:53:19.251 --> 03:53:20.586
TO GET THROUGH ON SOME OF THESE

03:53:20.653 --> 03:53:23.689
ISSUES LIKE HOMELESSNESS AND SO --

03:53:23.756 --> 03:53:25.324
OUR WORKERS ARE REALLY.

03:53:25.391 --> 03:53:26.392
I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT

03:53:26.459 --> 03:53:28.327
PERSPECTIVE IN SORT OF THE NEW

03:53:28.394 --> 03:53:30.396
ONES AND THE GRANULARITY THAT

03:53:30.463 --> 03:53:31.464
THEY BRING TO THESE

03:53:31.530 --> 03:53:32.798
CONVERSATIONS --

03:53:32.865 --> 03:53:34.700
WHERE WE DO THINK WE NEED TO GO

03:53:34.767 --> 03:53:36.369
WHERE WE THINK THERE'S --

03:53:36.435 --> 03:53:38.738
PROMISE AND HOPE FOR US IS THE

03:53:38.804 --> 03:53:40.272
FACT THAT THERE IS SO MUCH

03:53:40.339 --> 03:53:42.842
INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC AND WE

03:53:42.908 --> 03:53:43.976
THINK THAT --

03:53:44.043 --> 03:53:47.046
WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE ITSELF

03:53:47.113 --> 03:53:48.247
I WANT TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT

03:53:48.314 --> 03:53:49.715
ARGUING FOR THE STATUS QUO HERE

03:53:49.782 --> 03:53:51.517
WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE IN

03:53:51.584 --> 03:53:54.253
TERMS OF LEVERAGING THE COUNTY'S

03:53:54.320 --> 03:53:55.888
EXPERTISE.

03:53:55.955 --> 03:53:57.490
WE NEED.

03:53:57.556 --> 03:53:59.024
TO BE MINDFUL THAT COUNTIES ARE

03:53:59.091 --> 03:54:00.926
INTEGRATING ACROSS MULTIPLE

03:54:00.993 --> 03:54:03.696
SYSTEMS EDUCATION SOCIAL

03:54:03.763 --> 03:54:06.465
SERVICES CHILD WELFARE HOMELESS.

03:54:06.532 --> 03:54:07.867
JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIMINAL

03:54:07.933 --> 03:54:09.735
JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND SO THERE IS

03:54:09.802 --> 03:54:10.970
AN INTEGRATION POINT THAT GOES

03:54:11.036 --> 03:54:12.705
BEYOND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH

03:54:12.772 --> 03:54:13.706
DIMENSION.

03:54:13.773 --> 03:54:15.708
AND WE NEED DELIVERY SYSTEM

03:54:15.775 --> 03:54:16.776
TRANSFORMATION WHICH WILL

03:54:16.842 --> 03:54:18.811
REQUIRE INVESTMENT IN DOING THAT

03:54:18.878 --> 03:54:20.713
TRANSFORMATION IT'S NOT GOING TO

03:54:20.780 --> 03:54:21.247
HAPPEN NECESSARILY ON THE

03:54:21.313 --> 03:54:22.782
NATURAL --

03:54:22.848 --> 03:54:23.783
WHAT WE DID WITH WHOLE PERSON

03:54:23.849 --> 03:54:25.217
CARE PELLETS THAT'S GREAT WE

03:54:25.284 --> 03:54:26.752
NEED MORE OF THAT AND WE NEED

03:54:26.819 --> 03:54:28.487
STATEWIDE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT

03:54:28.554 --> 03:54:29.422
PLAN?

03:54:29.488 --> 03:54:31.090
OUT SOMETHING THAT GO CUTS

03:54:31.157 --> 03:54:32.324
ACROSS THE PATCHWORK IN THE

03:54:32.391 --> 03:54:34.460
INDIVIDUAL KIND OF ONE OFF HERE

03:54:34.527 --> 03:54:36.562
AND THERE AND THAT LOOKS SORT OF

03:54:36.629 --> 03:54:38.330
MACRO STATEWIDE --

03:54:38.397 --> 03:54:42.334
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING.

03:54:42.401 --> 03:54:43.369
TO HAVE A COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR

03:54:43.436 --> 03:54:44.570
WATCH WHAT SET OF SERVICES

03:54:44.637 --> 03:54:45.838
SHOULD COUNTIES BE DELIVERING

03:54:45.905 --> 03:54:48.040
WHAT DOES THAT COMMUNITY BASED

03:54:48.107 --> 03:54:50.810
CONTINUE OF CARE LOOK LIKE --

03:54:50.876 --> 03:54:53.546
YOU KNOW FROM LEASE RESTRICT TWO

03:54:53.612 --> 03:54:54.880
LOCKED BEDS AND HOW MUCH DO WE

03:54:54.947 --> 03:54:56.282
NEED OF EACH BECAUSE IF WE START

03:54:56.348 --> 03:54:58.851
INVESTING IN ONE THING HAPHAZARD

03:54:58.918 --> 03:55:00.319
WE NEED MORE LOCKED BEDS THEY

03:55:00.386 --> 03:55:01.921
WERE GONNA BUILD BLACK BEDS AND

03:55:01.987 --> 03:55:02.855
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO END UP AND

03:55:02.922 --> 03:55:04.223
MARK THAT EVEN IF THEY DON'T

03:55:04.290 --> 03:55:04.423
NEED.

03:55:04.490 --> 03:55:05.991
THAT RIGHT SO WE NEED TO HAVE

03:55:06.058 --> 03:55:08.160
EVERYTHING THERE --

03:55:08.227 --> 03:55:09.695
OUR WORK DOES GO FAR BEYOND THE

03:55:09.762 --> 03:55:11.897
WALLS OF THE CLINIC OR ANY

03:55:11.964 --> 03:55:13.866
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL OUR MEMBERS

03:55:13.933 --> 03:55:15.968
ARE OUT IN COMMUNITIES THEY ARE

03:55:16.035 --> 03:55:17.703
ON SKID ROW THEY ARE --

03:55:17.770 --> 03:55:20.639
IN THE FIELD AND OUR WORK DOES

03:55:20.706 --> 03:55:22.241
GO BEYOND ELIGIBILITY

03:55:22.308 --> 03:55:23.776
CLASSIFICATIONS.

03:55:23.843 --> 03:55:25.144

FROM ONE OF MY DISTRICTS AND

03:57:04.843 --> 03:57:05.811
UNFORTUNATELY --

03:57:05.878 --> 03:57:09.014
IT THE NATURE RURAL DISTRICT YOU

03:57:09.081 --> 03:57:10.149

THEY ARE ALL UNIFORMLY

03:57:18.357 --> 03:57:19.758
STRUGGLING WITH --

03:57:19.825 --> 03:57:21.660
MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AS WE

03:57:21.727 --> 03:57:22.928
LOOK AT SUICIDE PREVENTION WITH

03:57:22.995 --> 03:57:25.731
ALL THESE THINGS WE DON'T HAVE.

03:57:25.798 --> 03:57:27.566
ENOUGH PEOPLE IN SCHOOLS THAT

03:57:27.633 --> 03:57:29.101
CAN HELP WITH THIS SPEAKER AND

03:57:29.168 --> 03:57:30.636
AND THAT IS A PLACE WHERE WE'RE

03:57:30.703 --> 03:57:32.905
CHILDREN INTERFACE ON A DAILY

03:57:32.972 --> 03:57:34.607
BASIS TYPICALLY AND AND AND

03:57:34.673 --> 03:57:35.507
SCHOOLS AND SO EARLY

03:57:35.574 --> 03:57:37.209
INTERVENTION IN SCHOOLS ISN'T

03:57:37.276 --> 03:57:38.143
THERE SO JUST.

03:57:38.210 --> 03:57:41.413
DOES THE COUNTY INTERACT WITH AS

03:57:41.480 --> 03:57:43.048
AN ENTITY INTERACT WITH THE

03:57:43.115 --> 03:57:45.517
SCHOOLS ON THIS AND IT IS.

03:57:45.584 --> 03:57:46.719
THE THE THE SO YOU WORKING

TOGETHER ON ON THESE PROGRAMS

03:57:50.589 --> 03:57:51.991
AND IS NOT TYPICAL.

03:57:52.057 --> 03:57:53.025
THERE ARE MANY MANY OF THE

03:57:53.092 --> 03:57:55.194
COUNTIES HAVE SCHOOL SERVICES

03:57:55.260 --> 03:57:57.062
SCHOOLING SERVICES.

03:57:57.129 --> 03:57:59.965
AND DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY WE

03:58:00.032 --> 03:58:02.701
FUND POSITIONS THAT MAY BE

03:58:02.768 --> 03:58:04.737
COMMUNITY BASED PEOPLE --

03:58:04.803 --> 03:58:07.439
WE HAVE THE IN OUR SHOP WE HAVE

03:58:07.506 --> 03:58:09.408
US THE MANAGERS AND STAFF THAT

03:58:09.475 --> 03:58:10.676
THOSE SERVICES ARE CONTRACTED

03:58:10.743 --> 03:58:13.112
OUT TO COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS.

03:58:13.178 --> 03:58:16.281
AND I KNOW THAT ACROSS THE STATE.

03:58:16.348 --> 03:58:18.450
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO

03:58:18.517 --> 03:58:19.618
SAY MEETING WITH THE DIRECTORS

03:58:19.685 --> 03:58:21.020
THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE ALL

03:58:21.086 --> 03:58:23.889
TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW

03:58:23.956 --> 03:58:25.090
CAN THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL

03:58:25.157 --> 03:58:26.592
STAFFING WITHIN THE SCHOOL

03:58:26.659 --> 03:58:28.560
SETTINGS THE SCHOOLS ARE ASKING

03:58:28.627 --> 03:58:30.729
THE DEPARTMENTS. TO PROVIDE MORE

03:58:30.796 --> 03:58:32.564
STAFF -- TO

03:58:32.631 --> 03:58:34.366
PROVIDE MORE TRAINING WE'RE NOW

03:58:34.433 --> 03:58:35.834
WORKING WITH --

03:58:35.901 --> 03:58:37.803
FROM ELEMENTARY MIDDLE HIGH

03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:39.605
SCHOOL AND NOW THE COLLEGES ARE

03:58:39.672 --> 03:58:42.041
ALSO RESET REACHING OUT TO US SO

03:58:42.107 --> 03:58:44.643
I THINK THERE'S HI HIGH DEMAND.

03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:46.211
AND FOR THE COMMUNITIES LIKE

03:58:46.278 --> 03:58:48.113
YOUR SMALL COUNTIES I THINK IT'S

03:58:48.180 --> 03:58:49.848
REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE

03:58:49.915 --> 03:58:51.884
OPTIONS FOR THE SMALL COUNTIES

03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:54.019
IS IT I THINK IT'S TRAIN THE

03:58:54.086 --> 03:58:56.288
TRAINER -- I

03:58:56.355 --> 03:58:58.924
ALSO THINK THAT WE LOOK AT

03:58:58.991 --> 03:59:01.727
OPPORTUNITIES TO TRAIN PEOPLE IN

03:59:01.794 --> 03:59:03.696
YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO

03:59:03.762 --> 03:59:04.963
COULD COME IN AND BE IN THE VERY

03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:06.498
POSITIONS THAT WE'RE DESCRIBING

03:59:06.565 --> 03:59:07.266
HERE.

03:59:07.332 --> 03:59:09.635
WE HAVE COUNSELORS COMMUNITY

03:59:09.702 --> 03:59:11.637
WORKERS THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT

03:59:11.704 --> 03:59:13.839
LEVELS OF SERVICE THAT DON'T

03:59:13.906 --> 03:59:15.941
REQUIRE LICENSING WHO COULD DO

03:59:16.008 --> 03:59:17.443
THE KIND OF WORK THAT YOU'RE

03:59:17.509 --> 03:59:19.078
ASKING ABOUT A YEAR COUNTIES SO

03:59:19.144 --> 03:59:20.612
I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF

03:59:20.679 --> 03:59:22.548
FACTORS --

03:59:22.614 --> 03:59:24.516
BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

03:59:24.583 --> 03:59:26.185
OPPORTUNITY.

03:59:26.251 --> 03:59:28.253
IF IF I MASON AND THE COMMISSION

03:59:28.320 --> 03:59:30.189
ACTUALLY WENT UP AND DOWN THE

03:59:30.255 --> 03:59:32.291
STATE AND ENGAGE THE COUNTIES ON

03:59:32.357 --> 03:59:34.226
IT RELATED TO ISSUES ABOUT HOW

03:59:34.293 --> 03:59:35.661
TO SUPPORT INNOVATION.

03:59:35.728 --> 03:59:37.563
BUT WE CAME AWAY WITH SORT OF

03:59:37.629 --> 03:59:38.630
THREE FUNDAMENTAL REQUEST FROM

03:59:38.697 --> 03:59:41.133
THE COUNTIES FIRST THEY WANNA

03:59:41.200 --> 03:59:42.401
KNOW EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING.

03:59:42.468 --> 03:59:43.068
RIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW I

03:59:43.135 --> 03:59:45.137
MEAN THEY ENGAGE AT THE DIRECTOR

03:59:45.204 --> 03:59:46.638
LEVEL THEY ENGAGE IN.

03:59:46.705 --> 03:59:47.973
BUT THEY ACTUALLY ASKED COULD WE

03:59:48.040 --> 03:59:49.241
COULD THE STATE CREATES A

03:59:49.308 --> 03:59:50.509
CLEARING.

03:59:50.576 --> 03:59:52.111
OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD MAKE

03:59:52.177 --> 03:59:53.812
IT EASIER FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND

03:59:53.879 --> 03:59:55.247
WHAT KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS ARE

03:59:55.314 --> 03:59:56.615
IN PLACE.

03:59:56.682 --> 03:59:58.984
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE SCHOOL THE

03:59:59.051 --> 03:59:59.718
ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH IN THE

03:59:59.785 --> 04:00:00.285
SCHOOLS.

04:00:00.352 --> 04:00:01.754
AND SECOND THEY ASKED FOR

04:00:01.820 --> 04:00:03.188
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT IF

04:00:03.255 --> 04:00:05.090
THEY FIND SOMETHING THAT THEY

04:00:05.157 --> 04:00:05.624
THINK WILL WORK IN THEIR

04:00:05.691 --> 04:00:06.658
COMMUNITY.

04:00:06.725 --> 04:00:08.393
WHERE THEY TURN FOR HELP AND SO

04:00:08.460 --> 04:00:10.496
CAN THE STATE ACTUALLY

04:00:10.562 --> 04:00:11.230
FACILITATE?

04:00:11.296 --> 04:00:12.431
THE LEARNING.

04:00:12.498 --> 04:00:14.600
CROSS COUNTY ENGAGEMENT AND THE

04:00:14.666 --> 04:00:16.368
THIRD PIECE THEY SAID IS IT'S

04:00:16.435 --> 04:00:18.403
VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BREAK

04:00:18.470 --> 04:00:19.972
AWAY SOME SPECIALLY FOR SMALL

04:00:20.038 --> 04:00:21.507
COUNTIES FROM THEIR CORE

04:00:21.573 --> 04:00:23.442
OPERATIONS FUNDING TO TRY TO

04:00:23.509 --> 04:00:24.777
LEARN SOMETHING NEW.

04:00:24.843 --> 04:00:25.544
AND SO CAN THE STATE PROVIDES

04:00:25.611 --> 04:00:28.614
SOME AND SEND GET PROGRAMS OFF

04:00:28.680 --> 04:00:30.415
THE GROUND PARTICULARLY IF

04:00:30.482 --> 04:00:31.683
THROUGH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:33.252
THERE'S ENGAGEMENT AROUND HOW

04:00:33.318 --> 04:00:34.953
THEY CAN SUSTAIN.

04:00:35.020 --> 04:00:36.522
THAT IT'S NOT A GOOD NOT AT NOT

04:00:36.588 --> 04:00:37.589
A ONE TIME GRANT THAT THEN GOES

04:00:37.656 --> 04:00:39.825
AWAY BUT AN INVESTMENT IN A

04:00:39.892 --> 04:00:41.493
STRATEGY WHERE THEY LEARN TO

04:00:41.560 --> 04:00:42.694
MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE USING OTHER

04:00:42.761 --> 04:00:43.829
REVENUE SOURCES.

04:00:43.896 --> 04:00:46.098
EITHER BY INCREASING THEIR DRAW

04:00:46.165 --> 04:00:48.033
DOWN A FEDERAL MONEY BY MOVING

04:00:48.100 --> 04:00:49.434
DOLLARS FROM LESS EFFECTIVE

04:00:49.501 --> 04:00:51.069
TOMORROW EFFECTIVE OR SOME OTHER

04:00:51.136 --> 04:00:52.004
APPROACH.

04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:53.939
SO WE WE TO SEE TREMENDOUS

04:00:54.006 --> 04:00:55.974
OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN SACRAMENTO

04:00:56.041 --> 04:00:57.976
IN MONTEREY IN SANTA CLARA IN

04:00:58.043 --> 04:01:00.512
PLASTER IN RIVERSIDE WHERE WHERE

04:01:00.579 --> 04:01:01.680
WHERE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH

04:01:01.747 --> 04:01:04.483
DIRECTORS AND LOCAL SCHOOLS AND

04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:05.684
AND THEIR PARTNERS THAT ARE

04:01:05.751 --> 04:01:06.952
PROVIDING SERVICES.

04:01:07.019 --> 04:01:08.420
HAVE ACTUALLY FIGURED OUT

04:01:08.487 --> 04:01:09.888
DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THINGS AND

04:01:09.955 --> 04:01:11.356
WHAT'S REALLY EXCITING ABOUT

04:01:11.423 --> 04:01:13.525
THAT IS IS NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

04:01:13.592 --> 04:01:15.160
IN SOME PLACES THERE'S NINE

04:01:15.227 --> 04:01:16.662
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES IN SOME

04:01:16.728 --> 04:01:18.130
COMMUNITIES IT'S IT'S A COUPLE

04:01:18.197 --> 04:01:19.464
AND WHAT THE STATE REALLY NEED

04:01:19.531 --> 04:01:20.933
TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW DO WE

04:01:20.999 --> 04:01:22.601
ACTUALLY SUPPORT.

04:01:22.668 --> 04:01:24.536
MANY MANY APPROACHES TO FIGURE

04:01:24.603 --> 04:01:25.204
OUT.

04:01:25.270 --> 04:01:26.505
SIMULTANEOUSLY DOING THAT

04:01:26.572 --> 04:01:27.606
RESEARCH WORK TO FIGURE OUT

04:01:27.673 --> 04:01:28.740
WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR

04:01:28.807 --> 04:01:30.642
HOME IN WHAT SCENARIO IN WHAT

04:01:30.709 --> 04:01:31.610
COMMUNITY.

04:01:31.677 --> 04:01:33.011
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO

04:01:33.078 --> 04:01:34.580
BE A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE IT

04:01:34.646 --> 04:01:36.281
NEEDS TO BE A STATEWIDE STRATEGY.

04:01:36.348 --> 04:01:38.817
THAT ALLOWS EACH COUNTY TO

04:01:38.884 --> 04:01:41.720
TAILOR IT TO TO WHAT'S THE WHAT

04:01:41.787 --> 04:01:42.254
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THEIR

04:01:42.321 --> 04:01:44.156
COMMUNITY.

04:01:44.223 --> 04:01:44.923
I AND I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE

04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.824
THE WORK FORCES AT SUCH A HUGE

04:01:45.891 --> 04:01:46.959
PART OF THIS THE CALIFORNIA

04:01:47.025 --> 04:01:48.193
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION HAVE THEIR

04:01:48.260 --> 04:01:49.661
WORKFORCE COMMISSION.

04:01:49.728 --> 04:01:52.698
A YEAR AND A HALF OF OF MEETINGS --

04:01:52.764 --> 04:01:55.534
AND RECOMMENDATIONS --

04:01:55.601 --> 04:01:56.735
THERE IS A THERE IS THERE ARE

04:01:56.802 --> 04:01:58.971
RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND AND AND

04:01:59.037 --> 04:02:00.339
AN ESTIMATE OF FUNDING FOR THAT

04:02:00.405 --> 04:02:02.474
BUT WE DON'T WE ME THE WILL TO

04:02:02.541 --> 04:02:03.876
ACTUALLYGO FOR WITH THAT AND A

04:02:03.942 --> 04:02:05.444
BIG COMPONENT OF THAT WAS

04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:06.712
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

04:02:06.778 --> 04:02:09.448
AND SO WE WE HAVE TO HAVE TO DO

04:02:09.514 --> 04:02:11.617
THAT -- JUST.

04:02:11.683 --> 04:02:12.217
COME TO KEEP PLUGGING AWAY AT

04:02:12.284 --> 04:02:13.785
THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE THE WORK

04:02:13.852 --> 04:02:16.088
FORCE IS IS IS ONE OF THE HUGE

04:02:16.154 --> 04:02:17.656
ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING.

04:02:17.723 --> 04:02:19.091
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THE

04:02:19.157 --> 04:02:20.826
THROUGHOUT THE STATE --

04:02:20.893 --> 04:02:22.127
AND IT OBVIOUSLY VARIES FROM

04:02:22.194 --> 04:02:24.329
PLACE TO PLACE BUT IT'S A IT'S

04:02:24.396 --> 04:02:24.930
IT'S THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT WE

04:02:24.997 --> 04:02:28.467
HAVE.

04:02:28.533 --> 04:02:29.568
SO I THINK THEM THERE'S

04:02:29.635 --> 04:02:30.602
DIFFERENT MODELS THAT WE'RE

04:02:30.669 --> 04:02:31.737
LOOKING UP BECAUSE IN CONTRA

04:02:31.803 --> 04:02:34.539
COSTA WE HAVE A COUNTY HOSPITAL.

04:02:34.606 --> 04:02:36.642
IT HAS A MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY

04:02:36.708 --> 04:02:38.610
SOLANO COUNTY RAIL ALSO

04:02:38.677 --> 04:02:40.145
REPRESENT DOES NOT.

04:02:40.212 --> 04:02:41.313
IN THIS PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN

04:02:41.380 --> 04:02:44.917
THAT DOES IF YOU WOULD.

04:02:44.983 --> 04:02:45.851
END.

04:02:45.918 --> 04:02:48.487
A ONE OF THAT GOES [inaudible]

04:02:48.553 --> 04:02:51.023
TO THE HOSPITAL'S. FOR SEVENTY

04:02:51.089 --> 04:02:53.058
TWO HOURS IF THEY THEY RECORD OR

04:02:53.125 --> 04:02:55.494
WHATEVER AND AFTER THAT IF

04:02:55.560 --> 04:02:56.695
THERE'S NO ROOM IN THE CRISIS

04:02:56.762 --> 04:02:56.895
BEDS.

04:02:56.962 --> 04:02:59.364
THE PROJECT.

04:02:59.431 --> 04:03:01.066
SO MEDICAL NOT BUILD.

04:03:01.133 --> 04:03:02.401
THE COUNTIES BUILT ON ANOTHER

04:03:02.467 --> 04:03:04.369
LEVEL OF HOUSING THESE PEOPLE.

04:03:04.436 --> 04:03:04.903
OKAY.

04:03:04.970 --> 04:03:07.139
AND THEN WHEN I LOOK AT AND

04:03:07.205 --> 04:03:10.475
AGAIN IN THE MEDI CAL STRUCTURE.

04:03:10.542 --> 04:03:12.577
ARE WE STILL HAVING PROBLEMS

04:03:12.644 --> 04:03:14.079
WITH PROVIDERS.

04:03:14.146 --> 04:03:16.014
IN THE MET MEDI CAL WORLD OF

04:03:16.081 --> 04:03:17.816
CREAM THE LESS REIMBURSEMENT

04:03:17.883 --> 04:03:19.084
RATE THEM.

04:03:19.151 --> 04:03:21.486
THEN THE THE PRACTITIONERS OR OR

04:03:21.553 --> 04:03:22.888
OR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS

04:03:22.955 --> 04:03:24.456
ACTUALLY CHARGE.

04:03:24.523 --> 04:03:26.491
ARE WEAK CONSTRAINING OURSELVES

04:03:26.558 --> 04:03:26.792
[inaudible]

04:03:26.858 --> 04:03:30.529
AND GETTING.

04:03:30.595 --> 04:03:31.496
A LESSER AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT

04:03:31.563 --> 04:03:33.699
WANT TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE OF

04:03:33.765 --> 04:03:36.501
MEDI CAL.

04:03:36.568 --> 04:03:37.069
YOU KNOW AND THEN WHAT IS A

04:03:37.135 --> 04:03:38.704
DETERRENT.

04:03:38.770 --> 04:03:40.906
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE H. M.

04:03:40.973 --> 04:03:42.975
O.'S P. PO'S THAT AREN'T

04:03:43.041 --> 04:03:44.343
STEPPING UP TO DO.

04:03:44.409 --> 04:03:47.713
I MEAN I HEAR. ONE IN PARTICULAR

04:03:47.779 --> 04:03:49.514
NOW IS STARTING TO LOOK AT IT

04:03:49.581 --> 04:03:53.151
AND AND IDENTIFYING THE NEED.

04:03:53.218 --> 04:03:54.886
FOR A LARGER IT'S A MOST --

04:03:54.953 --> 04:03:55.988
BUT THERE'S NOT OTHERS THAT ARE

04:03:56.054 --> 04:03:58.123
NOT STEPPING UP THEIR NOT

04:03:58.190 --> 04:03:59.524
RECOGNIZING THE ISSUE.

04:03:59.591 --> 04:04:02.928
AND IT IN IT FALLS INTO.

04:04:02.995 --> 04:04:05.030
IS THE COUNTY OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S

04:04:05.097 --> 04:04:06.932
LAP.

04:04:06.999 --> 04:04:08.967
SO I KNOWS OF A BUNCH OF POINTS

04:04:09.034 --> 04:04:12.537
OF QUESTIONS BUT YOU KNOW.

04:04:12.604 --> 04:04:14.539
YOU KNOW FIRST IS THE MEDI CAL

04:04:14.606 --> 04:04:17.342
REIMBURSEMENT RATE CORRECT.

04:04:17.409 --> 04:04:18.276
FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

04:04:18.343 --> 04:04:20.445
BECAUSE I HAVE.

04:04:20.512 --> 04:04:23.248
GENERAL PRACTITIONERS WE WON'T

04:04:23.315 --> 04:04:24.916
ACCEPT THE MEDICAL PATIENT.

04:04:24.983 --> 04:04:26.585
SURE SO I I THINK A FEW THINGS

04:04:26.651 --> 04:04:27.819
TO TRY TO ADDRESS YOUR POINTS

04:04:27.886 --> 04:04:29.154
AND CERTAINLY LET ME KNOW IF I'M

04:04:29.221 --> 04:04:30.489
MISSING ANYTHING WITH RESPECT TO

04:04:30.555 --> 04:04:32.190
THE REIMBURSEMENT --

04:04:32.257 --> 04:04:33.725
ON THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH

04:04:33.792 --> 04:04:35.460
SIDE IN THE SUBURBS YOU SIDE --

04:04:35.527 --> 04:04:37.095
WE WE DON'T DIRECTOR THE

04:04:37.162 --> 04:04:38.630
COUNTIES IN TERMS OF THE RATES

04:04:38.697 --> 04:04:40.432
THAT THEY WOULD SET IT LATE

04:04:40.499 --> 04:04:41.566
WHATEVER THEIR COST AND THAT

04:04:41.633 --> 04:04:41.800
BEING.

04:04:41.867 --> 04:04:43.301
WE ARE YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE

04:04:43.368 --> 04:04:44.836
CERTIFIED IN AND DRAWN DOWN IN

04:04:44.903 --> 04:04:46.004
TERMS OF FEDERAL FUNDS SO IT'S A

04:04:46.071 --> 04:04:47.406
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN SOME

04:04:47.472 --> 04:04:48.874
OF THE PHYSICAL HEALTH.

04:04:48.940 --> 04:04:50.242
GREAT CONVERSATION FOR JUST THAT

04:04:50.308 --> 04:04:51.910
JUST TO CLARIFY THAT --

04:04:51.977 --> 04:04:53.245
SO THAT'S REALLY SORT OF A

04:04:53.311 --> 04:04:53.812
COUNTY AND AGAIN I THINK YOU

04:04:53.879 --> 04:04:55.680
HEARD OF MICHELLE TALK ABOUT AND

04:04:55.747 --> 04:04:57.983
OTHERS THERE'S A COMBINATION OF

04:04:58.050 --> 04:04:59.151
CONTRACTED PROVIDERS AND

04:04:59.217 --> 04:05:00.252
ACTUALLY COUNTY.

04:05:00.318 --> 04:05:02.587
SORT COUNTY TO COUNTY STAFF

04:05:02.654 --> 04:05:05.090
THEMSELVES TO IN SOME WAYS YOU

04:05:05.157 --> 04:05:06.892
CAN'T REALLY SORT OF IDENTIFIED

04:05:06.958 --> 04:05:07.893
AS EASILY BECAUSE AGAIN

04:05:07.959 --> 04:05:09.094
SOMETIMES THESE ARE JUST COUNTY

04:05:09.161 --> 04:05:10.228
AND AND AND AND MANY COUNTIES

04:05:10.295 --> 04:05:11.530
ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER ARE

04:05:11.596 --> 04:05:12.764
ACTUALLY EMPLOYED BY THE COUNTY

04:05:12.831 --> 04:05:13.632
AND SO NOT PAID.

04:05:13.698 --> 04:05:14.966
SORT OF ON A SERVICE BASIS AND

04:05:15.033 --> 04:05:16.701
NOT PAID FOR MEDI CAL DIFFERENT

04:05:16.768 --> 04:05:17.736
THAN -- YOU

04:05:17.803 --> 04:05:19.371
KNOW AND ANOTHER TYPE OF PROVIDE

04:05:19.438 --> 04:05:21.306
US INDIVIDUAL SO JUST TO CLARIFY

04:05:21.373 --> 04:05:23.942
THAT IT IS NOT IT IS.

04:05:24.009 --> 04:05:25.043
UNIQUE TO THE MEDI CAL.

04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:27.479
DELIVERY STRUCTURE I THINK THE

04:05:27.546 --> 04:05:28.814
THE OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE

04:05:28.880 --> 04:05:30.082
REALLY SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE OF

04:05:30.148 --> 04:05:31.583
THE BIFURCATION THAT OUR STATE

04:05:31.650 --> 04:05:33.185
HAS SET UP IN TERMS OF THE

04:05:33.251 --> 04:05:34.486
DELIVERY OF SERVICES.

04:05:34.553 --> 04:05:36.721
SO WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDI CAL

04:05:36.788 --> 04:05:38.457
MANAGED CARE PLANS THEY HAVE AN

04:05:38.523 --> 04:05:40.325
OBLIGATION BUT IT'S LIMITED IT'S

04:05:40.392 --> 04:05:42.527
LIMITED TO THOSE WITH WHAT WE

04:05:42.594 --> 04:05:44.129
STAY MILD TO MODERATE WHICH IS

04:05:44.196 --> 04:05:45.063
NOT.

04:05:45.130 --> 04:05:47.699
LIKE DIAGNOSIS SPECIFIC IT'S NOT.

04:05:47.766 --> 04:05:49.634
CLEAR CUT AND I THINK THAT WAS

04:05:49.701 --> 04:05:50.869
SOMETHING THAT WAS INTRODUCED A

04:05:50.936 --> 04:05:52.671
FAIRLY RECENTLY WITH WITH THE

04:05:52.737 --> 04:05:54.072
ACA SO IT'S IT'S STILL.

04:05:54.139 --> 04:05:55.607
YOU KNOW IN THE EARLY YEARS OF

04:05:55.674 --> 04:05:57.142
THAT -- IN

04:05:57.209 --> 04:05:58.243
TERMS OF THAT WORK AND I THINK

04:05:58.310 --> 04:05:59.778
WE'VE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

04:05:59.845 --> 04:06:01.413
PLANS AND THE COUNTIES TO TRY TO

04:06:01.480 --> 04:06:02.614
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HAVING

04:06:02.681 --> 04:06:04.483
PEOPLE WHO ARE FALLING THROUGH

04:06:04.549 --> 04:06:06.017
THE CRACKS OF DOUGH.

04:06:06.084 --> 04:06:06.651
PLANS RESPONSIBLE NO COUNTIES

04:06:06.718 --> 04:06:07.986
RESPONSIBLE AND WE CERTAINLY

04:06:08.053 --> 04:06:09.287
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY

04:06:09.354 --> 04:06:10.355
IS WHEN THOSE ISSUES COME UP

04:06:10.422 --> 04:06:12.390
ABOUT HELPING THEM IDENTIFY.

04:06:12.457 --> 04:06:13.658
IS THE PLAN IS THAT THE PLANS

04:06:13.725 --> 04:06:15.193
OBLIGATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

04:06:15.260 --> 04:06:16.027
PAYING THEM TO DO OR IS IT THE

04:06:16.094 --> 04:06:17.829
COUNTIES OBLIGATION AND SO I

04:06:17.896 --> 04:06:18.697
THINK THAT GOES TO THAT

04:06:18.763 --> 04:06:19.898
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF THE

04:06:19.965 --> 04:06:21.133
STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM.

04:06:21.199 --> 04:06:22.801
AND AGAIN FROM THE WORK THAT

04:06:22.868 --> 04:06:23.602
WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN

04:06:23.668 --> 04:06:25.137
LOOKING AT WITH OUR COUNTY

04:06:25.203 --> 04:06:25.971
PARTNERS WITH OUR HEALTH PLANS

04:06:26.037 --> 04:06:27.639
WITH OUR YOU KNOW STATE WORK

04:06:27.706 --> 04:06:29.808
FORCE IN TERMS OF HOW SHOULD WE

04:06:29.875 --> 04:06:31.209
BE DELIVERING THIS CARE WE KNOW

04:06:31.276 --> 04:06:32.711
WE'RE NOT DELIVERING IT THE BEST

04:06:32.777 --> 04:06:33.712
WAY POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW.

04:06:33.778 --> 04:06:37.082
SO CAN WE FIND A WAY WITH IN THE

04:06:37.149 --> 04:06:38.750
OTHER FOR OVERLAYING PIECE THAT

04:06:38.817 --> 04:06:40.452
IS ALWAYS CHALLENGING IS THERE

04:06:40.519 --> 04:06:41.920
FEDERAL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

04:06:41.987 --> 04:06:43.155
HAS PARTICULAR RULES ABOUT HOW

04:06:43.221 --> 04:06:44.556
WE CAN CLAIM MONEY.

04:06:44.623 --> 04:06:45.557
SO THAT'S ALWAYS A YOU KNOW A

04:06:45.624 --> 04:06:47.392
VERY COMPLICATING FACTOR I THINK

04:06:47.459 --> 04:06:48.727
YOU KNOW AS AS OUR COUNTY FOLKS

04:06:48.793 --> 04:06:50.061
TALKED ABOUT HER THE FUNDING

04:06:50.128 --> 04:06:51.596
BEING VERY COMPLICATED IN THE

04:06:51.663 --> 04:06:53.198
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

04:06:53.265 --> 04:06:54.432
I WOULD SAY IN THE MEDICAID

04:06:54.499 --> 04:06:56.668
SYSTEM IT'S EXPONENTIALLY MORE

04:06:56.735 --> 04:06:58.236
WHO ARE COMPLICATED.

04:06:58.303 --> 04:06:59.471
AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS

04:06:59.538 --> 04:07:00.605
THAT I THINK WE STRUGGLED WITH

04:07:00.672 --> 04:07:01.907
AS A STATE OVER THE YEARS AS

04:07:01.973 --> 04:07:03.708
WE'VE TRIED TO EXPAND SERVICES

04:07:03.775 --> 04:07:05.143
AND AND REALLY GET PEOPLE WHAT

04:07:05.210 --> 04:07:07.512
THEY NEED WE ALSO HAVE TO FIGURE

04:07:07.579 --> 04:07:09.147
OUT A WAY TO FUND IT BOTH FROM A

04:07:09.214 --> 04:07:09.881
STATE SIDE WHICH OBVIOUSLY.

04:07:09.948 --> 04:07:11.783
HAS CHOICES THAT THE LEGISLATURE

04:07:11.850 --> 04:07:13.218
AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE TO MAKE

04:07:13.285 --> 04:07:14.252
BUT THEN HOW DO WE GET THE

04:07:14.319 --> 04:07:16.021
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ALSO FUNDS

04:07:16.087 --> 04:07:17.389
WERE THEIR COMPONENT AND SO.

04:07:17.455 --> 04:07:18.557
YOU KNOW GET YOU HER MICHELLE

04:07:18.623 --> 04:07:19.191
TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE PERSON

04:07:19.257 --> 04:07:20.592
CARE PILOTS WE TALKED ABOUT

04:07:20.659 --> 04:07:21.927
THOSE EARLIER YOU THAT WAS

04:07:21.993 --> 04:07:23.461
REALLY AN INNOVATIVE WAY FOR US

04:07:23.528 --> 04:07:25.297
TO GET ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS

04:07:25.363 --> 04:07:25.897
TO ADDRESS SOME OF WHAT WE'RE

04:07:25.964 --> 04:07:27.032
TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT THAT

04:07:27.098 --> 04:07:27.966
MONEY IS NOT.

04:07:28.033 --> 04:07:29.834
SOLELY FOCUSED ON OF THOSE WITH

04:07:29.901 --> 04:07:31.002
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT A

04:07:31.069 --> 04:07:32.737
FAIR NUMBER OF THE OF THE

04:07:32.804 --> 04:07:33.772
COUNTIES HAVE THAT AT THE TARGET

04:07:33.838 --> 04:07:35.140
POPULATION.

04:07:35.207 --> 04:07:36.341
AND WE ARE LOOKING AS A PART OF

04:07:36.408 --> 04:07:37.475
THESE WEAVER AN OLD OF HOW DO WE

04:07:37.542 --> 04:07:39.511
SCALE THAT UP HOW DO WE REALLY

04:07:39.578 --> 04:07:40.745
START TALKING ABOUT.

04:07:40.812 --> 04:07:42.080
LET'S JUST PROVIDE THE SERVICES

04:07:42.147 --> 04:07:44.449
A PERSON NEEDS AND NOT MAKE NOT

04:07:44.516 --> 04:07:46.685
TRY TO SAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE IN

04:07:46.751 --> 04:07:48.053
THIS IS AGAIN PEOPLE HAVE HEARD

04:07:48.119 --> 04:07:50.055

04:07:50.121 --> 04:07:50.689
PROGRAM YOU NEED TO HAVE PURPLE

THIS PROGRAM YOU NEED TO BE BLUE.

04:07:53.525 --> 04:07:54.960
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT ARE

04:07:55.026 --> 04:07:56.394
BENEFICIARIES FACING IT DOESN'T

04:07:56.461 --> 04:07:58.363
IT DOESN'T WORK BUT WE WE WANT

04:07:58.430 --> 04:07:59.397
TO TRY TO FIX THAT BUT WE ARE

04:07:59.464 --> 04:08:00.899
OVERLAYING THESE COMPLICATIONS

04:08:00.966 --> 04:08:04.803
OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE

04:08:04.869 --> 04:08:05.971
COUNTY AND STATE STRUCTURE NOT

04:08:06.037 --> 04:08:08.640
JUST FROM MENTAL HEALTH NICKEL

04:08:08.707 --> 04:08:11.743
SERVICES.

04:08:11.810 --> 04:08:12.777
TO SO IT IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE

04:08:12.844 --> 04:08:14.045
I'M HOPEFULLY UP TO THE

04:08:14.112 --> 04:08:15.213
CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF MY VERY

04:08:15.280 --> 04:08:16.381
EXCITED ABOUT.

04:08:16.448 --> 04:08:18.149
THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND

04:08:18.216 --> 04:08:18.783
WORKING WITH THESE PARTNERS AND

04:08:18.850 --> 04:08:20.218
OTHERS WHO ARE HERE AND

04:08:20.285 --> 04:08:21.753
LISTENING BECAUSE I THINK WE

04:08:21.820 --> 04:08:23.488
HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY.

04:08:23.555 --> 04:08:24.923
BUT IT IS IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY

04:08:24.990 --> 04:08:26.224
AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

04:08:26.291 --> 04:08:27.559
BE CHOICES THAT WE'RE ALL GOING

04:08:27.626 --> 04:08:30.161
TO HAVE TO MAKE YOUR TARGET THE

YOUR WHOLE AREA.

SO AGAIN FOLKS YOU HAVE HEARD ME

04:08:36.868 --> 04:08:37.902
TALK ABOUT THIS I TALK ABOUT IT

04:08:37.969 --> 04:08:39.337
SORT OF IS FIVE TEN AND FIFTEEN

04:08:39.404 --> 04:08:40.105
YEARS.

04:08:40.171 --> 04:08:41.406
IN TERMS OF REALLY THINKING

04:08:41.473 --> 04:08:43.174
ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE THESE

04:08:43.241 --> 04:08:44.276
CHANGES IN A WAY THAT'S NOT

04:08:44.342 --> 04:08:45.610
GONNA BREAK ANYTHING BECAUSE I

04:08:45.677 --> 04:08:47.212
THINK OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT A

04:08:47.279 --> 04:08:48.647
SITUATION WHERE WE FULLY

04:08:48.713 --> 04:08:50.048
TRANSITION TO SOMETHING AND IT

04:08:50.115 --> 04:08:51.483
TURNS OUT THAT WAS THE WRONG

04:08:51.549 --> 04:08:52.384
DECISION.

04:08:52.450 --> 04:08:54.185
SO OUR FIRST GOAL IS TO RELEASED

04:08:54.252 --> 04:08:55.553
HAVE THESE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF

04:08:55.620 --> 04:08:57.222
THE NEXT WEAVER SITUATION TO

04:08:57.289 --> 04:08:59.190
REALLY BE LOOKING AT WHERE CAN

04:08:59.257 --> 04:09:01.059
WE MAKE IMMEDIATE SORT OF SHORT

04:09:01.126 --> 04:09:02.360
TERM GAINS IN TERMS OF BETTER

04:09:02.427 --> 04:09:03.862
CARE COORDINATION --

04:09:03.928 --> 04:09:06.164
OBLIGATIONS ON HEALTH PLANS AND

04:09:06.231 --> 04:09:07.565
COUNTIES IN TERMS OF INTEGRATION

04:09:07.632 --> 04:09:09.901
AND SORT OF SIMPLIFYING THE

04:09:09.968 --> 04:09:11.770
PROCESS FOR THE BENEFICIARY --

04:09:11.836 --> 04:09:13.004
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE

04:09:13.071 --> 04:09:14.673
VERY INTERESTED IN IN TALKING

04:09:14.739 --> 04:09:16.141
WITH COUNTY SAN PLANS ABOUT

04:09:16.207 --> 04:09:18.777
PILOTING INTEGRATED MODELS.

04:09:18.843 --> 04:09:20.245
I THINK THAT IT.

04:09:20.312 --> 04:09:21.546
IF YOU IT WAS ME DEVELOPING THE

04:09:21.613 --> 04:09:22.380
WORLD RIGHT WE WOULD HAVE AN

04:09:22.447 --> 04:09:23.448
INTEGRATED SYSTEM WE WOULDN'T

04:09:23.515 --> 04:09:26.284
HAVE BEEN A FISHERIES WHO HAVE

04:09:26.351 --> 04:09:27.719
TO ACCESS SERVICES.

04:09:27.786 --> 04:09:29.154
ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE

04:09:29.220 --> 04:09:30.488
USE DENTAL SOME YOU KNOW SOME

04:09:30.555 --> 04:09:31.990
BEFORE SERVICE THE MANAGED CARE

04:09:32.057 --> 04:09:33.425
THAT THEY DESERVE I CAN'T.

04:09:33.491 --> 04:09:35.427
HELP HER HARD ENOUGH AND I THINK

04:09:35.493 --> 04:09:36.094
FOR ANY OF US BUT IN THE MEDICAL

04:09:36.161 --> 04:09:37.095
SYSTEM.

04:09:37.162 --> 04:09:38.430
IT'S VERY COMPLICATED SO IF I

04:09:38.496 --> 04:09:40.065
COULD RUN THE WORLD I WOULD SAY

04:09:40.131 --> 04:09:41.766
WE PUT ALL IN ONE SYSTEM WE HAVE

04:09:41.833 --> 04:09:42.400
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT SYSTEM

04:09:42.467 --> 04:09:43.435
IS -- BUT I

04:09:43.501 --> 04:09:44.703
THINK THAT'S A LONGER TERM GOAL

04:09:44.769 --> 04:09:46.304
GIVEN SOME OF THE YOU KNOW AGAIN

04:09:46.371 --> 04:09:47.706
RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO HOW

04:09:47.772 --> 04:09:49.174
THE FINANCING IS DONE AND AND

04:09:49.240 --> 04:09:49.808
THE ROLES OF THE STATE IN THE

04:09:49.874 --> 04:09:52.043
COUNTY BUT I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT

04:09:52.110 --> 04:09:52.277
IN THIS.

04:09:52.344 --> 04:09:55.080
NEXT FIVE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

04:09:55.146 --> 04:09:56.748
IN CONCERT GETTING TO THAT LONG

04:09:56.815 --> 04:09:57.982
TERM PICTURE [inaudible]

04:09:58.049 --> 04:10:01.653
THE HOPEFULLY I WILL.

04:10:01.720 --> 04:10:04.756
THAT'S THE GOOD THING.

04:10:04.823 --> 04:10:06.424
WELL I THINK THAT --

04:10:06.491 --> 04:10:09.194
AT THE TOP OF PAGE --

04:10:09.260 --> 04:10:11.062
TWENTY WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT IS

04:10:11.129 --> 04:10:12.464
FOR MANY YEARS THE LEGISLATURE'S

04:10:12.530 --> 04:10:14.032
GRAPPLED WITH HOW TO ASSESS

04:10:14.099 --> 04:10:16.234
ASSESS BOTH ACCESS TO AND

04:10:16.301 --> 04:10:17.569
QUALITY OF CARE IN THE MEDIC

04:10:17.635 --> 04:10:19.003
MEDIC CAL PROGRAM.

04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:20.705
IN GENERAL AND PARTICULARLY WITH

04:10:20.772 --> 04:10:23.842
REGARD TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:10:23.908 --> 04:10:25.176
SERVICES.

04:10:25.243 --> 04:10:25.844
THE NEXT SENTENCE I THINK IS THE

04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:27.345
MOST IMPORTANT THIS TYPE OF

04:10:27.412 --> 04:10:29.080
INFORMATION HAS REMAINED FAIRLY

04:10:29.147 --> 04:10:31.649
ON ACCESSIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR

04:10:31.716 --> 04:10:32.450
A HOST OF REASONS AND

04:10:32.517 --> 04:10:34.252
FRUSTRATION AMONG LEGISLATORS IS

04:10:34.319 --> 04:10:35.653
GROWING.

04:10:35.720 --> 04:10:36.654
I THINK THAT IS CLEAR AND I

04:10:36.721 --> 04:10:38.123
THINK THAT IT'S IT'S SOMETHING

04:10:38.189 --> 04:10:40.525
THAT TO WITH EACH COUNTY HAVING

04:10:40.592 --> 04:10:41.760
THE ROOM PROGRAM.

04:10:41.826 --> 04:10:43.361
WITH --

04:10:43.428 --> 04:10:45.196
COUNTY IS RUNNING THESE THAT THE

04:10:45.263 --> 04:10:46.965
STATE DOES STRUGGLE WITH THE

04:10:47.031 --> 04:10:48.299
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

04:10:48.366 --> 04:10:49.667
IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO

04:10:49.734 --> 04:10:52.570
HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED --

04:10:52.637 --> 04:10:54.639
AS THE AS THE PROGRAMS GET

04:10:54.706 --> 04:10:56.641
FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM

04:10:56.708 --> 04:10:57.976
THE STATE.

04:10:58.042 --> 04:10:59.511
IT'S BECOMING HARDER AND HARDER

04:10:59.577 --> 04:11:02.547
TO REVIEW SO WE WANT YOU TO GIVE

04:11:02.614 --> 04:11:03.481
US -- TO

04:11:03.548 --> 04:11:05.316
ASSESS IT IT'S BECOMING MORE

04:11:05.383 --> 04:11:06.885
MORE DIFFICULT WE HOLD YOU

04:11:06.951 --> 04:11:08.319
RESPONSIBLE TO PROVIDE US THE

04:11:08.386 --> 04:11:11.022
INFORMATION BUT WITH THE

04:11:11.089 --> 04:11:11.556
COUNTIES SO IT [inaudible]

04:11:11.623 --> 04:11:12.957
HAVING.

04:11:13.024 --> 04:11:15.093
THIS CONTROL IN THIS LAYERING IT

04:11:15.160 --> 04:11:17.262
BECOMES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT

04:11:17.328 --> 04:11:17.996
IS SOMETHING.

04:11:18.062 --> 04:11:21.065
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING.

04:11:21.132 --> 04:11:21.633
TO RESOLVE TODAY BUT THAT'S

04:11:21.699 --> 04:11:23.701
SOMETHING THAT ABSOLUTELY WILL

04:11:23.768 --> 04:11:27.439
BE ADDRESSED IN WILL BE --

04:11:27.505 --> 04:11:29.340
WE'LL BE CONTINUING TO ADDRESS

I AM VERY MAKE DATING WITH THE

04:11:41.920 --> 04:11:43.221

FRAZIER NOTICED IT'S A VERY

04:11:59.003 --> 04:12:00.672
COMPLICATED SYSTEM --

04:12:00.738 --> 04:12:02.507
BUT WE DO THINK THAT COUNTIES

04:12:02.574 --> 04:12:03.274
ARE DOING THE WORK THEY'RE DOING

04:12:03.341 --> 04:12:04.409
IT WELL --

04:12:04.476 --> 04:12:05.743
WERE WORKING ACROSS MANY

04:12:05.810 --> 04:12:06.845
DIFFERENT --

04:12:06.911 --> 04:12:08.513
SILOS AND LINES --

04:12:08.580 --> 04:12:10.548
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

04:12:10.615 --> 04:12:12.550
WITH EVERYBODY TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:12:12.617 --> 04:12:13.485
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE SERVICES

04:12:13.551 --> 04:12:14.953
THEY NEED.

04:12:15.019 --> 04:12:16.788
ONE AREA THAT WE'RE STILL

04:12:16.855 --> 04:12:19.624
WORKING ON RIGHT NOT ONLY HEALTH

04:12:19.691 --> 04:12:21.426
AND MENTAL HEALTH BUT STILL IT

04:12:21.493 --> 04:12:22.560
WORKING ON INTEGRATING --

04:12:22.627 --> 04:12:24.195
MENTAL HEALTH WAS SUBSTANCE USE

04:12:24.262 --> 04:12:26.865
DISORDER SERVICES SUBSTANCE USE

04:12:26.931 --> 04:12:27.465
DISORDER REALLY WAS INTEGRATED

04:12:27.532 --> 04:12:28.233
INTO.

04:12:28.299 --> 04:12:29.133
MENTAL HEALTH UNDER THE

04:12:29.200 --> 04:12:30.368
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UMBRELLA

04:12:30.435 --> 04:12:32.303
PRETTY RECENTLY AND SO --

04:12:32.370 --> 04:12:33.104
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON

04:12:33.171 --> 04:12:34.772
INTEGRATING THAT AND SOME THINGS

04:12:34.839 --> 04:12:37.041
THAT WOULD HELP US WITH THAT WAS --

04:12:37.108 --> 04:12:38.409
IMAGES SAY FUNDING.

04:12:38.476 --> 04:12:39.544
CAN ONLY BE USED FOR MENTAL

04:12:39.611 --> 04:12:41.079
HEALTH SERVICES NOT S. U. D.

04:12:41.145 --> 04:12:42.580
SERVICES SO THAT'S ONE CHANGE

04:12:42.647 --> 04:12:44.349
THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IF WE WERE

04:12:44.415 --> 04:12:45.950
GOING TO MAKE ANY CHANGES THERE.

04:12:46.017 --> 04:12:46.618
SO --

04:12:46.684 --> 04:12:47.619
WORKING ON INTEGRATING WHAT

04:12:47.685 --> 04:12:48.753
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE INTEGRATING

04:12:48.820 --> 04:12:51.022
AND THEN WORKING ON OUTSIDE THE

04:12:51.089 --> 04:12:51.789
SILOS WITH ALL OF OUR OTHER

NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT WHERE
