QUESTION ITEMS THE FIRST APARTMENT UP IS THE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL. AND THAT'S ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS BUSINESS MODERNIZATION AND RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE. THE MORNING MORNING. OKAY MR APPLE SMITH -- SOME MEMBERS OF THE OBJECT ABOUT THIS ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF OKAY ALL BEVERAGE CONTROL AND WITH ME IS MY CHIEF MINISTRATION FINANCE OPERATIONS AND MANY OTHER THINGS RANDY NAMES -- I WANTED TO GIVE ARE JUST A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF HOW WE GOT HERE FOR THESE TWO PROPOSALS. AND THEN I WILL DISCUSS THE SPECIFICS OF THOSE PROPOSALS BATTLE. YES. OKAY SO WE WERE OTHER DEPARTMENTS FORMED IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE BY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT CHARGED WITH THE REGULATION OF THE MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF ALCOHOL. CURRENTLY WE HAVE NINETY TWO THOUSAND LICENSEES IN THE STATE TO DO ONE OF THOSE THREE THINGS IN ESSENCE. AND THEN WE HAVE ABOUT -- FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE EMPLOYEES TWENTY FOUR OFFICES AROUND THE STATE. 45% OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE ALL WARM PEACEFUL. AND THE RESTAURANT GOING LICENSING WORKING IN THE NECESSARY WORK. WE ARE COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SAFETY -- WE ARE COMMITTED TO PREVENTION AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH OUR ALLIES THESE IN THE STATE WHO. CURRENTLY ARE HAVE A LOT OF BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND ALL A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK. FOR A LIVING. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH PREVENTION GROUPS AND OTHER INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS. ARE WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM ALL. OF OUR THE REASONABLE PROPOSALS FOR YOU TODAY IS WE DO NOT HAVE. THE STRUCTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO ESSENTIALLY GIVE THEM THE SERVICES THEY DESERVE. AND JUST AS A COMMONSENSE MEASURE OF THAT WE HAVE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WE HAD [inaudible] NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE AS WE OUR LIVE CHAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE SAME PRESENCE. FOR COVERAGE THAT WE WANT TO ADD ON THE LICENSING SIDE ARE ARE TIMELINESS SLIPPING. WE DON'T PROVIDE OUR STAKEHOLDERS WITH A SIX CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT THEY DESERVE -- OUR OUR STATE OUR LICENSEES WITH -- PALE HAIR ARE THESE THE SUPPORT OUR BUDGET. HAVE TOLD US FOR YEARS THAT THEY WOULD SUPPORT HIGHER FEES IF WE COULD GIVE THEM THE SERVICE THAT WE TALK ABOUT. I HAVE TALKED ABOUT OVER THE YEARS I'M IN OVER THE CAP COURSE THE LAST YEAR WE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS SENSUALLY DEVISE A PROPOSAL. TO SEE WHAT IS THE APARTMENT DOING THAT DOESN'T NEED TO DO PERCENT WHICH CHARGE. WHAT IS IT NOT DOING ENOUGH OF WHAT IS REALLY THE RIGHT SIDE? AND THOSE ARE THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE FOR YOU TODAY. WE WERE LANCE WAS OUT THEY ARE. PROPOSALS ARE REALLY INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS -- THEY COME IN SORT OF THREE AREAS AN I. T. -- IN ENFORCEMENT IN A LICENSING BUT REALLY. ARE PROPOSALS REALLY WORK TOGETHER. BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CREATE A FISHING SEASON LICENSING FOR THE CHANGES WERE PROPOSING AND OR SPENT. MISSION SEASON ENFORCEMENT WITH THE CHANGES WERE IN A PROPOSAL LICENSING. I'M SO LET ME JUST KIND OF GO OVER SOME SORT OF GLARING WEAKNESSES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE DESIGNED -- TO ONE IS THAT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ONLINE PRESENCE -- LICENSEES MEANING THAT WE CAN'T PROCESS LICENSE APPLICATIONS ELECTRONICALLY. WE CANNOT ACCEPT PAYMENTS OF ANY KIND ELECTRONICALLY. OUR FOR THROUGH CREDIT CARDS SO WE PROCESS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHECKS EVERY YEAR. PHYSICAL PAPER CHECKS AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ACCEPT PAYMENTS. WE HAVE NO INTERNAL AUTOMATION WHICH MEANS THAT WE JUST HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF INEFFICIENCIES. WHEN WE PROSECUTE A CASE -- ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL WHICH IS WHICH IS. WHICH IS A ESSENTIALLY ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS AGAINST LICENSEES. WE HAVE A PAPER FILE THAT HAS TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE OFFICE TO ANOTHER AROUND THE STATE -- WHEN WHEN ONE OF OUR LICENSEES OF ARE DECISIONS INSTEAD OF ELECTRONIC FILE THAT WE CAN SEND OF THE DEALS BOARD WE HAVE TO COPY EVERYTHING INTERFACE FILES AND? PART OF THE RECORD -- WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY FOR AGENTS IN THE FIELD TO LOOK UP A LICENSEE AND WHAT ITS PRIVILEGES ARE WHAT ITS RESTRICTIONS ARE -- THEY ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE OFFICE AND LOOK IT UP BATES. SO JUST MANY THINGS THAT WE EXPECT IN A MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WE'RE JUST NOT ABLE [inaudible] TO I'M. IN TERMS OF OUR LICENSING WE WE HAVE NO LICENSING DIVISION -- WE STARTED BIFURCATING THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE SEPARATED THE FUNCTIONS OF KEYS OFFICERS IN LICENSING PROFESSIONALS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO. BUT WE REALLY NEVER GOT TO THE POINT REBUILT THE STRUCTURE SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SYSTEMATIC APPROACH FOR TRAINING OF OUR PEOPLE IN THE SUBSTANTIVE AREAS IN WHICH THEY WORK -- FOR FOR PRODUCING POLICIES AND GUIDELINES TO HELP THEM IN THEIR WORK. AND REALLY NOTHING TO ENSURE A STATE LIKE CONSISTENCY OTHER THAN THE SHEER TALENT AND GOOD WILL OF OUR EMPLOYEES. WHICH IS PRETTY FABULOUS BUT IT'S REALLY NOT THE WAY TO BUILD AN ORGANIZATION AND MAINTAIN IT. ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE -- WE WE IT'S JUST A SHEER SHEER NUMBERS WE HAVE AGAIN THE SAME THE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME NUMBER OF ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE THAT WE HAD. IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE BUT NOW WE HAVE NINETY TWO THOUSAND LICENSEES AS OPPOSED. FORTY THOUSAND LOT MORE PEOPLE ON THE STATE. LOT MORE COMPLEXITY TO WHAT THEY DO. AS A RESULT THEY'RE NOT AS QUICK IN INVESTIGATING LINKS. THEY'RE NOT AS A THEY'RE NOT AS SPOUSAL WITH BEING ABLE TO GO OUT AND DO AND PREVENTED OF WORK IN TERMS OF IN THE LICENSEES OF OURS WERE NOT RUNNING BUSINESSES IN THE WAY THEY SHOULD AND TEACHING THEM HOW THEY CAN ACTUALLY CORRECT. THEM IS SOMETHING WE DO WE JUST DON'T DO ENOUGH OF IT. WE DON'T DO ENOUGH MINOR DECOY ACTIONS WHICH ARE REALLY A PRIMARY FOCUS TO ENSURE THEIR LICENSEES ARE NOT TELLING -- ON THE ON ANOTHER ISSUES WE ARE ALSO -- GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE PROGRAM WHICH IS PART OF THE PROPOSAL ARE YOU TODAY. I'M AND WE REALLY DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE ON I. T. BASIS TO BE ABLE. TO DO THE THINGS ARE REQUIRED UNDER THAT STATUTE -- IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US THOUGH AS OF SYSTEMS WERE PLANNING TO BUILD. WILL REALLY BE ONES THAT WE CAN USE HAVE INTERFACES WITH THE PUBLIC AND WITH OUR LICENSEES IN A WAY THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO TO NOW. SO IF THAT IS TO CHALLENGE THE MOMENT BUT IT'S ALSO A FAIRLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A I'M PART OF THE PROPOSAL. IS IS THE IS THE DEAL WITH OUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT -- WE ARE RUNNING WE HAD ABOUT WE HAD A SURPLUS IN OUR BUDGET OF ABOUT THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FIVE YEARS AGO. EVEN SLOWLY. BENDING THAT DOWN AND TORE NOW TO THE POINT WHERE JUST CHANGE OUR SERVICES THEY ARE TODAY. WE NEED ABOUT A 15% INCREASE. IN WORKING WITH FINANCE ON THE AT THE INCREASE -- WE DECIDED TO MOVE TOWARDS A MODEL WERE ACTUALLY CHARGING PEOPLE. FOR THE COST OF WHAT IT TAKES TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION WITH RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT. DO NOT ESSENTIALLY DO. AND ON THE RENEWAL SIDE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY IS IS BONDS THAT PAY FOR OUR FIRST ACTIVITIES. WE ARE TRYING TO A LINE LIKE PRIVILEGES OF LICENSEES WITH EACH OTHER AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE QUITE DESPERATE. SO BEYOND THAT 15% ARE MUCH OF THE PROPOSAL'S BE SEATED BAY -- AND ESSENTIALLY -- IF IF IF OUR MODERNIZATION PROJECT GOES FORWARD AS WE LANDED PASSED CLOSING IT TO YOU. IT'S CAN LICENSEES ARE GOING TO PAY ABOUT 10% MORE THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD SO JUST AS A FEW EXAMPLES. IF YOU'RE A LARGE BEER MANUFACTURING YOU'RE BUYING FOR A LICENSE -- ARE PROPOSAL'S MODERNIZATION WOULD HAVE A NINE HUNDRED AND FIVE DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE. IF WE JUST DO NOTHING OTHER THAN FIX OUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. HE IS -- EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS. FOR A LARGE GROCERY STORE THAT SELLS -- FULL RANGE OF ALCOHOL PRODUCTS -- THEY WOULD PAY SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS BETTER FOR ABLE TO MODERNIZE THEY WOULD PAY AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS OR SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS. AND THIS IS A FINAL EXAMPLE -- THE RENEWAL OF BEEF OR AM OF BEER AND WINE RESTAURANT. WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS AND OUR PROPOSALS IT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS WE'RE JUST GONNA FIX. SO IT'S REALLY AGAIN 10% MORE TO ACTUALLY MODERNIZE THE DEPARTMENT AND THE WAY THAT OUR LICENSEES OF ALL THOSE THIRD WILLING. TO I'M HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR I CAN. GO THROUGH THE ISSUE ITEMS AT THIS POINT. AND THEN WE'LL GO. TO SPECIFIC ISSUES. HI KRISTIN WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I CAN PROVIDE SOME SPECIFIC COMMENTS WE GET THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IF YOU'D PREFER -- OR IF YOU WANT SOME GENERAL COMMENTS AND BY THE WE HAVE GENERAL COMMENTS AND THEN A I THINK CLEARLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD SOME CHALLENGES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SO AS WAS MENTIONED THESE PROPOSALS ARE AIMED AT A THING THOSE -- ISSUES THERE ARE PRETTY EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY THE THIS WELL THE FIRST ONE WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IS AN I. T. PROPOSAL I'M WHICH INCLUDES AM ADDING SOME THIS SERVICE IS THE SECOND ONE REALLY IS THIS. COMBINATION OF ADDRESSING THIS THIS DEFICIT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS I'M AND I THINK REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHER ACTIONS ARE TAKEN SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS THAT DEFICIT BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY. PROJECTED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE FUND ABOUT THIS YEAR SO -- PROBABLY SOME STEPS ARE NEEDED -- TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE REGARDLESS AND THEN SECONDARILY AS THEY MENTIONED THEY PAIR THAT WITH SOME -- SOME OTHER UP PRETTY -- BROUGHT BROAD OUT WIDE RANGING CHANGES -- THROUGH A LOT OF THEIR DIFFERENT SERVICE AREAS AND FUNCTIONS -- TO TRY TO SORT OF SHORE UP SOME OF THE AREAS THAT THEY'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES OVER THE YEARS I'M SO HAPPY TO PROVIDE SOME SPECIFIC COMMENTS WHEN WE GET. AT THAT POINT. HI CLINT CALENDAR PARMA FINANCE THAT YEAH JUST THE HIGHER LEVEL COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD PROBABLY OF AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD WITH THE DEPARTMENT. TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING FUNDING SHORTFALL AND SORT OF MODERNIZE THE DEPARTMENT AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS. TO KILL THIS POTATO BUT WE KIND OF THAT LANDED ON OUR YOU KNOW WHAT WE THOUGHT. WAS ARE WE ARE BEST ABLE TO DO WITH THE DATA AVAILABLE AND SORT OF BRING UP THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SERVICES [inaudible] OKAY YES. MADAM CHAIR I MEANT TO THE GREAT LAKES YESTERDAY WITH THE DIRECTOR AND WELL I GUESS I'D HAVE TO SAY. IMPRESSED AND IN THE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED TO SEE AN AGENCY THAT IS. RUN SUCH A TIGHT SHIP FOR SO LONG. THE THE THIS IS THE YEAH. MORE -- RESPONSIBLE IF YOU WOULD GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY IS. VERY RARE. BUT THAT SAID IT BECAME PRETTY CLEAR TO ME THAT THEY DO NEED SOME HELP IN A PATHWAY. TO STRENGTHEN THEMSELVES AND THEN SOLIDIFY SO THAT'S MY THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW AND I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO ASSISTING AND I'M GLAD THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WELL WITH THE LA -- AND WITH FINANCE. THANK YOU. THE NUMBER IN THE GENERAL. OKAY ALRIGHT WELL WE SO ISSUE TO BUSINESS MODERNIZATION RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE YES. THE PART IN SEEKS TO MODERNIZE EXTERNAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES TO BETTER SERVE TO BETTER SERVE THE PUBLIC AND ITS INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS WE INITIALLY HAD TO SET DISTINCT PROPOSALS ONE FOR THEM FOR YOU SERVICES AND ANOTHER FOR THE RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE -- THIS PROPOSAL COMBINES THOSE AND THE REASON WE DID THAT IS BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S SIGNIFICANT FUNCTION FUNCTIONAL AND ARCHITECTURAL OVERLAP IN THE WAY THE IT SYSTEMS WOULD WORK -- WE THERE'S RESULT IN COST SAVINGS AND THEN ALSO THERE'S THERE'S LESS RISK IN PROCEEDING IN THAT WAY IN OUR VIEW. COM WE ARE SEEKING FIVE POINT. AND TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED AND TO NINETY NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN NINETEEN NINETY TEAM NINETY EXCUSE ME. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWO FUND. THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROJECT -- WILL REQUEST THE REST OF THE FUNNY NEXT YEAR ONCE THE PROJECT PROCUREMENTS ARE FINALIZED AND WE'RE BETTER ABLE -- WITH GREATER CERTAINTY -- PROJECT THE OUT YOUR COSTS. THERE'S ALSO A A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE CLARIFIES THE TO AUTHORITY TO CHARGE FEES. IN RELATION TO THE EXAMINATION THAT'S PART OF THE RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE PROGRAM. CAN I JUST ASK YOU THIS ON I'M SORRY SHOULD WAIT FOR YOU. TO I'M THAT THAT'S IT I'M DONE OKAY THANK YOU ON THE TWO POINT NINE MILLION. IS THAT FOR THE ACTUAL -- NEW TECHNOLOGY. THAT WILL BE. NEEDED. NOT JUST THE POSITIONS. CORRECT RIGHT THE FIVE POINT FIVE TO BREAK THAT DOWN JUST A FIVE POINT FIVE POSITIONS THE FOR THE FIRST YEAR -- AND THEN IT'S IT'S FOR THE COSTS OF ESSENTIALLY THE THE THE THE MENTORS WHO BUILD IT AND FOR THE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS THAT WALL ON THAT WOULD BE PART OF IT. OKAY OKAY. THEN CAN YOU BREAK DOWN THE RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVER. THERE'S THERE'S THE TRAINING PART AND THEN THERE'S THE CERTIFICATION. PART COULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT SURE LOST SHORES SO SO WHAT ARE THE FEES WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOUR STAFF MEMBERS WHO WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED. WE WERE CAUGHT IN THE SAID HE RECEIVED THIS LAST YEAR'S BUDGET -- AND THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY DEVELOPING ALL THE REGULATIONS -- AND THE AND THE AND THE ESSENTIALLY THE STAFF SUPPORT THIS CAN BE NEEDED TO DEAL WITH. THE SUBSTANTIVE SIDE OF IT. THIS MONEY IS NOW FOR ESSENTIALLY BUILDING THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY RUN THE PROGRAM. I'M SO ONE OF THE THINGS INDUSTRY TOLD US THEY WANTED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS THIS FOR THIS TO BE AUTOMATED. SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP TRACK OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVERS AND AUTHORIZED THE SERVERS. BECAUSE THE PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW ARE ON THE BUSINESSES THEMSELVES NOT ON THE INDIVIDUAL SERVERS. SO TO BUILD OUT WE NEEDED TO REALLY BUILD AND AND AN INTERFACE THAT WOULD ALLOW -- INTERACTION BETWEEN BUSINESS OWNERS BETWEEN THE SERVERS ARE ACTUALLY BEING CERTIFIED -- THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD MAINTAIN -- WE ALSO DETERMINED THAT -- THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE A TRAINER OURSELVES EVEN THOUGH THE STATUE AUTHORIZES THAT. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS COST EFFECTIVE WE BELIEVE THAT THE THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND ALSO A LOT OF ENTITIES TO PROVIDE THIS TRAINING FOR FREE. EITHER THROUGH COUNTIES OR CITIES SOMETIMES EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES THERE'S MANY INDUSTRY GROUPS THAT THEY WOULD BE AT POSITION TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE BE THE TRAINERS AS OPPOSED TO US BUILDING AT A JUNIOR COLLEGE FOR MORE OR LESS OF THE ABC. SO SO WE WE JUST WE WE ARE NOT GONNA BE A TRAINER AND LESS WE DISCOVER THAT IT'S NOT AS COST EFFECTIVE AS IT APPEARS FOR THE SERVERS UP TO TAKE IT. AND ALSO IF -- THERE'S SOME SOME UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR OR FOR ACCESS IF THEY'RE UNABLE TO ACTUALLY GET THE TRAINING THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THAT. THEN WE MIGHT BECOME TRAINERS TO ACTUALLY GET THOSE COMMUNITIES. I'M WE WE ALSO DETERMINE THE WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS THAT WOULD BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND GENERALLY TO THEIR LIKING THAT WE ACTUALLY CONDUCT THE EXAM OURSELVES. AND THIS IS BECAUSE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO RUN. THE SYSTEMS -- AND HAVE A OF OF OF OF PROCTORED ALTHOUGH IT'S VIRTUALLY PROCTORED EXAM VERY EXPENSIVE VERY DIFFICULT IN A LOT OF JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. AND THOSE WOULD BE PRIMARILY THE INDUSTRY GROUPS AND THE THE GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENTS TO SOMEONE I ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE TRAIN. SO WE ARE GOING TO WE ARE GOING TO BE THE EXAM. PROVIDER OURSELVES ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH OUTSIDE VENDORS LITTLE ONE THAT. WE WILL BE MONITORING THOSE EXAMS JUST TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTES AND THE REQUIREMENTS. OF THE ROLES OF THE ESTABLISH OKAY SO A LITTLE BIT. OKAY SO -- IF I AM A SERVER. ALCOHOL SERVER RIGHT -- I NOW HAVE TO HAVE. DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE I'M AT NOW. WHAT PART OF ME NOW AND WHAT WILL BE REQUIRED OF ME? AND HOW DO I DO IT SO I WORKING. AND THERE'S THESE NEW RULES TRAINING OR CERTIFICATION HOW NEW ARE THERE ARE THERE SOME. IS THERE SOME CERTIFICATION CURRENTLY REQUIRED WHO DOES IT I GUESS I WANNA KNOW. WHERE WE SAY TO ALL THESE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BARTENDERS AND? ALCOHOL SERVERS ALL OVER THE PLACE. IN THIS INDUSTRY WHAT DO WE SAY TO THEM NOW. YES SO PARTLY THAT MESSAGE WILL WE WE ANTICIPATE WILL COME OUT THROUGH WHATEVER PUBLIC. AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS WERE ABLE TO DO BUT ALSO THROUGH THE EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES WILL BE AWARE OF THIS -- REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE SERVERS THAT ARE CERTIFIED. SO IF I'M A SERVER WHO NEEDS TO BE CERTIFIED IF I'M CURRENTLY EMPLOYED WE THINK THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT THE EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE TIME AND THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING THAT SERVER -- CERTIFIED AS JUST A MATTER OF LABOR LAW -- BECAUSE IT'S A REQUIRE IT'S A JOB. FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT EMPLOYED -- THEY WILL HAVE -- TO TAKE A COURSE AND ACHIEVE THE CERTIFICATION -- CELL -- THE WAY THAT CAN BE DONE IS THROUGH IN PERSON TRAINING OR IT CAN BE DONE. THEIR INTERNET TRAINING. OKAY SO THEY WOULD FIND A A TRAINER. THEY WOULD SIGN UP THEY WOULD TAKE THE COURSE AND THEN ONCE THEY COMPLETED THE COURSE SATISFACTORILY. THEN THEY WOULD BE SENT TO OUR WEB PORTAL WHICH ESSENTIALLY WOULD ALLOW THEM TO TAKE THE EXAM -- OURS THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO REQUIREMENTS STATEWIDE. FOR ANY SERVER TO BE CERTIFIED. THERE ARE LOCAL THE HOWEVER REQUIREMENTS. FOR SERVICE TO BE CERTIFIED WHICH AGAIN ARE -- ARE APPLIED TOWARDS THE BUSINESSES SOME BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRED AS PART OF THEIR SIEU PEAS OR THEIR BUSINESS PERMITS ARE OUR THE LOCAL JURISDICTION DOES IT. ACTUALLY HAVE THEIR SERVERS CERTIFIED AND AND ACTUALLY IN SOME OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS IS NOT JUST SERVERS IT'S ACTUALLY -- EMPLOYEES WHO SELL ALCOHOL OVER THE COUNTER FOR CARRYING AWAY. THIS BILL REALLY JUST DEALS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN RESTAURANTS BARS AND CENTER FOR SERVING FOR CONSUMPTION ON THE PREMISES. OKAY SO THEY WOULD GO IN THEY WOULD TAKE A COURSE -- AND THEN THEY WOULD BE CHECKED INTO OUR OUR SYSTEM AND THEY WERE TAKEN EXAM AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE A CERTIFICATION -- ONCE THEY PASSED THE EXAM THAT'S PORTABLE IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO AN EMPLOYEE AND OF COURSE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS INDUSTRY -- WORKING MORE THAN ONE JOB AND SO LITTLE BUILD CARRY THAT WITH THEM WHEREVER THEY GO AND IT LASTS FOR THREE YEARS WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE THE EXAM AGAIN AFTER. YEARS. WE AND WE FOR M. AND AND JUST JUST FOR THOSE WHO DO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT THEMSELVES -- OUR RESEARCH SHOWED THAT THE NATION WIDE COST IS ABOUT SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS. INCLUDING TAKING THE EXAM. THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE ESTIMATE -- IT MAY GO AS HIGH AS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT THERE SHOULD BE OPTIONS THAT ARE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS LAUGHS. AND THAT'S FOR AN INTERNET BASED COURSE. AND THE AND THE COURSE IS MEANT TO TEACH ON SO HE HEARS THE SUBJECTS THAT THE COURSE TEACHES -- FIVE THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THE BODY. THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON SOCIETY. INTERVENTION TECHNIQUES FOR SERVERS TO IDENTIFY MINERS PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER INTOXICATED. GENERAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE CONCERNS IN THEIR ESTABLISHMENT AND THEY THEY HAVE A SITUATION WHERE VIOLENCE MAY BREAK OUT ONE OF THESE BILLS TO DO ABOUT IT. AND THEN THE FOURTH AREA IS FOR MANAGERS TO ESSENTIALLY DEVELOPED IN IN IN ARMS SINCE SYSTEMATIC. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN TERMS OF RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT ON THAT THOSE VERY SAME TOPICS. AND IN THE FIFTH CATEGORY IS ON A CALIFORNIA LAW RELATING TO A SERVICE. AND WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME IN WHICH YOU EXPECT. ALL OF THIS TO BE UP AND RUNNING. SURE AND AND THE THE SERVERS TO ACTUALLY KNOW BY SUCH AND SUCH DATE IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO DO THAT RIGHT SO. SO WITH THE DISPATCH IS PRETTY CLEAR AND WE ARE ON COURSE TO MEET ITS REQUIREMENTS WE WILL HAVE WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE SO TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS IT'LL CENTRALLY. TELL -- PROVIDERS WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THE CURRICULUM IS HOW ALL THE REQUIREMENTS WORK -- WE'VE HAD MANY MANY MEETINGS OVER THE COURSE OF THESE NINE MONTHS WITH PROVIDERS WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PREVENTION GROUPS AND OTHERS. AS OF JULY FIRST WE WILL BE PUBLISHING A REGULATIONS TO GO FOR THE FORMAL PROCESS WITH THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS. EXCUSE ME OFFICE OF MINISTER OF LAW. AND THEN -- WE SHOULD HAVE THOSE REGULATIONS IN PLACE BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. AND THEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR -- TWENTY TWENTY WE WILL START -- SENSUALLY LICENSING ALL THE PROVIDERS -- THAT OR THERE'S ALSO A PROVISION FOR A FOR FOR AN EIGHT FOR A SEPARATE AGENCY TO TO TO LICENSE THEM THEMSELVES WHICH IS A LITTLE COMPLEX BUT IN ANY EVENT. THE M. THE THE PROVIDER SHOULD BE LICENSE OVER THE COURSE OF TWENTY TWENTY AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY'LL START -- PROVIDING THEIR COURSES AT THAT TIME -- AND THEN BY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE. PEOPLE SERVING ALCOHOL AND FALLING IN THESE CATEGORIES NEED TO BE CERTIFIED IT'S MORE REALLY ABOUT TWO YEARS AWAY -- WE ARE POLICY DEVELOPMENT ARE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT -- IS GOING EXTREMELY WELL THE THE NEXT CHALLENGE FOR US IS IS REALLY THE I. T. COMPONENT THAT SET FORTH AND ARE BUDGET ITEM TODAY -- JUST SOME THINGS TO SORT OF I THINK WATCH OUT FOR IT -- THAT THERE'S NOT ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR SCAMS YOU KNOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE THE SERVERS YOU'LL BE LOOKING TO GET A A QUICK COURSE -- SOMETIMES AS TO YOU NO CHARGE TRIPLE THE AMOUNT YES THINGS LIKE THAT -- JUST LOOK OUT FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THAT AS A POTENTIAL UNFORTUNATELY NEW INDUSTRY -- THAT OTHERS COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND THEN OBVIOUSLY TO GET THE WORD OUT. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE YES AND NO PLAYERS WILL BE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE SERVICE REALLY KNOW WHAT'S COMING YEAH I AGREE -- YES SENATOR. NOW. THE LICENSE. THE EXAM ITSELF WILL BE CONDUCTED BY SOME THIRD PARTY IS THAT CORRECT. IT'LL WHEN YOU'RE TAKING THE EXAM YOU'LL THINK THE A. B. C. IS ACTUALLY ADMINISTERING IT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH OUR INTERFACE AND WE'RE GONNA TELL YOU WHETHER YOU'RE PASSED OR FAILED. BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN OUTSIDE VENDOR THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE CONDUCTING THE EXAM WITH OUR OVERSIGHT -- THERE'S GONNA BE LOTS OF ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING WE THINK LOTS OF QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE THEY'RE GONNA NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING TO BE ABLE TO RUN ESSENTIALLY PHONE BANKS AND OTHER BANKS. REALLY NOT SOMETHING THAT WERE SET UP TO DO I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE A FISHING FOR US TO ESTABLISH THAT SO THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON WHY WE FELT AN OUTSIDE VENDOR CONDUCTING THE EXAMINATION WOULD BE IN THE ALL ALL THE EXAMS WILL BE DONE. ON THE INTERNET THEY WILL NOT HAVE A PLACE. THE EXAM TAKEN THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. YEAH I'M FAMILIAR WITH A LOT OF THESE. TO REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THEY'VE BEEN A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO EXAMS THE NEW THEN WILL CONTROL THE THE QUESTIONING QUESTIONS AS WELL. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND THEN WHAT THEY DO JUST ADMINISTER. AND YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THEN THE LICENSING THAT GOING TO BE A SEPARATE ENTITY TO NOW THAT'S BUT THAT'S DIRECTLY UNDER YOUR JURISDICTION. THAT'S CORRECT THEY THEY THEY APPLY -- TO THEY EITHER APPLY TO US TO BE LICENSE DIRECTLY OR THE APPLIED TO THE STATUTE ALLOWS FOR ACCREDITATION AGENCY. ONE ACTUALLY COME WANTS TO COME FORWARD AND ACTUALLY BE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO OUR CREDIT THE EXAM. HELLO IT'S A LITTLE OF AN UNUSUAL STRUCTURE BUT EITHER WAY THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO EITHER APPLY THE ACCREDITATION AGENCY OR TO US TO BE AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT EXAMINATIONS. MOST OF THESE HAVE ACCREDITATION AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND NOW I'M NOT SAYING AND IN TERMS OF THE ABC BUT OTHER. OTHER ENTITY TO THE NATIONAL MEDITATION. SO THERE IS AN AUTHORITY THAT DOES THE ACCREDITATION AND THEN A ARMS THE QUALITY AND THE DEVICE MEETING THE STANDARDS THAT'S CORRECT. AND THEN ONE THING ALSO TALK ABOUT IT IS THE I. T. IN THE INTER CONNECTED VIDEO MEAN A THERE'S BEEN SO MANY PROBLEMS. WITH THIS SITE KEY AND AND CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. YOU WERE THE LEAST OF CONCERNS THAT. DO YOU HAVE GOOD CONFIDENCE THAT THE VENDORS AND AND YOUR CONNECTIVITY IT IS GOING TO BE YEAH WELL MONITORED AND FUNCTIONAL AND YES I THINK THAT'S PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE ARE NOT. CREATING A A BRAND NEW LARGE SYSTEM WHAT WE'RE REALLY MOSTLY DOING IS BUILDING ON THE LICENSING SYSTEM THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. RIGHT SO SO IT'S REALLY AN INCREMENTAL. THING AS OPPOSED TO WE'RE JUST STARTING SOMETHING FROM SCRATCH IT'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF EVERY SINGLE THING OF THE DEPARTMENT DOES [inaudible] THANK YOU. ONE MORE QUESTION THE TRAINING -- YOU TALKED ABOUT ONE OF THE ELEMENTS WAS -- SORT OF GENERAL HEALTH AND WELFARE. I ASSUME HOW TO HANDLE YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING LIKE HOW TO HANDLE SOMEONE HAD BEEN. HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK RIGHT. DOES THAT. ALSO INCLUDE. HOW TO HANDLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT? I THE SERVERS I DON'T KNOW. YES I WILL FIND OUT PLEASE YEAH. BECAUSE AT THAT. COMES IN AND AND USUALLY WHEN THEIR SEXUAL HARASSMENT SINCE IT'S CONSIDERED SOMETHING THAT. OF THE SERVERS ARE JUST REQUIRED TO TOLERATE -- THE VERSES. HOW TO HANDLE IT? AND HOW TO HANDLE IT IN A WAY THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BECOME RESPONSIBLE. FOUR PLEASE WRITE TO ARRESTORS ACTIONS SO. SHAPE THE S.. AND THEN I WOULD ALSO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE -- TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT EXIST OUT THERE ALREADY ON THIS SO I SO YOU'RE GONNA. SOMEHOW CONNECT WITH THOSE TRAINING PROGRAM WE RAN HAVE AN WE HAVE MET WITH MANY OF THEM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT CURRICULUM SHOULD LOOK LIKE WHAT -- WHAT THEY NEED TO SENSUALLY BUILD OPERATE AND RUN A PROGRAM THAT'LL MAKE SENSE UNDER A LAW WE WE OURSELVES ACTUALLY DO OPERATE A TRAINING PROGRAM? WHICH IS A FULL A FULL DAY OF TRAINING. FOR IN THIS AREA -- BUT IT'S IN PERSON AND IT'S REALLY NOT A COST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR MOST PEOPLE -- TO PRESENT WE PLAN TO CONTINUE THAT TRUE TRAINING PROGRAM BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ACTUALLY ON LIQUOR STORES -- CHANGE THE FOCUS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW SORT OF ALL SERVICE. WHERE IS THERE'S THIS TRAIN DOESN'T REQUIRE LIQUOR STORES TO BE TRANSFER OF WE CAN ACTUALLY REALLY MORE FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGES OF THAT OUR TRAFFIC READ? IT'S A BIT ALL BE A BETTER USE OF OUR TIME AND MONEY. OKAY MAYBE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IT ALSO OFFER. OF THESE COURSES THAT IS THAT IS POSSIBLE YEAH. OKAY GREAT -- AND THE FEES -- THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE SERVERS WOULD HAVE TO PAY. IS THERE -- SPECIFIC I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A A SPECIFIC. CAP ON THE AMOUNT OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. I DO WE HANDLE THAT. THIRD THERE'S NOT A SPECIFIC. MENTION OUR PROPOSAL -- THERE THERE'S THE BILL ITSELF HAD LANGUAGE THAT ESSENTIALLY LIMITED AS TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR BUT THAT WAS REALLY IF WE ARE GOING TO BE SPECIFICALLY FOR A TRAINING COURSE WE PERFORM BE PROVIDING. I'M RIGHT NOW OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS THAT THE THE COST OF THE EXAM OUR COSTS THE EXAM IS AROUND THREE DOLLARS -- BUT I KNOW THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF A CAP -- WHICH OBVIOUSLY ROLLING OUT A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT MAKE SENSE OF THE COMMITTEE. I WOULD URGE SOME VERSION OF A CAPSULE THAT. WE CAN SAY HOW LONG AGO OKAY YEAH I'D DIE AND I WOULD ONLY POINT OUT THAT THE ARE -- PROPOSAL DOES LIMIT BECAUSE IT SAYS IT'S THE FEES MAY BE CHARGED NECESSARY TO COVER REASONABLE COST FOR ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY THIS ARTICLE SO WHILE IT'S NOT SPECIFIED DOLLAR AMOUNT. IT WOULDN'T BE SOME KIND OF LARGE AMOUNTS TO SORT OF FIND OTHER ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT SO IT'S SORT OF LIMITED ONLY TO THE SCOPE OF THIS EXISTING PROGRAM. SO IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT IT'S IT IS RESTRICTED TO THE PROGRAM COST. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE THE FINANCE WANTS. TO I JUST A COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS AND WHEN MY RECOMMENDATION SO -- A RECOMMENDATION AND RELATES TO YOU THROUGH THIS -- I. T. PLANNING PROCESS AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE ACROSS -- GOVERNMENT -- SO ESSENTIALLY THIS PROJECT IS MIDWAY THROUGH THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS WHICH IS THIS NEW PROCESS IMPLEMENTED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO -- FOR PLANNING AND UNDERTAKING I. T. PROJECT. AND AND SO BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF MIDWAY THROUGH ITS ITS COMPLETED I THINK STAGE TO YOU OF THAT A MULTI STAGE PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T YET HAVE I TOTALLY COMPLETE AND FULL PICTURE OF WHAT THE COST OF THIS PROJECT WILL LIKELY BE -- AS THE DEPARTMENT. TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT PROCESS AND RECEIVE SOLICITATIONS FOR EXAMPLE -- IT'LL HAVE A MORE REFINED ESTIMATE AS TO WORK MEETINGS AND BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE AS I SAID WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE RECOMMENDED IN OTHER AREAS. AND THAT WOULD MAKE THE FUNDING CONTINGENT ON AND I NOTICE TO THE LEGISLATURE -- REGARDING THIRD COMPLETING THAT PROCESS AND AND WHAT THE ULTIMATE COSTS ARE SO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE WE THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE OVERSIGHT. ON IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA AND AND GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD A NINETY PROJECT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. AND THE SECOND THIN I JUST WANTED TO NOTE IS -- AS WAS MENTIONED I THINK MULTIPLE TIMES THIS PROJECT REALLY HAS TWO COMPONENTS THERE'S THE ESERVICES COMPONENT AND THERE'S RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE COMPONENT -- WITH REGARD TO THE RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE COMPONENT -- THIS IS IS -- THIS IN TOTAL THIS PIECE WILL -- WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADD TO THE TOTAL COST OF IMPLEMENTING THAT PROJECT SO THAT PRIDE BASICALLY THE REQUIREMENT THAT THESE FOLKS UNDERGO THAT TRAINING -- WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT WHEN THAT HAPPENS THAT ESTIMATE ACOSTA SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER SO THAT'S JUST AN IN THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO WE WANT TO FLAG FOR THE LEGISLATURE JUST. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOES SOMETHING THAT BOOKS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH [inaudible] YES. REALLY MANNING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ASSESSES EACH PROJECT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. DESERVE TO DETERMINE IF BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY WHEN FUNDING. IS CONSIDERED WHILE PROJECT IS STILL IN THE PROJECT PRO LIFE CYCLE -- PROCESS. AND THE INTENT OF THE POWER PROCESS IS THAT PROJECTS DO THEIR DILLON. DILIGENCE DURING THE PLANNING -- PROCESS AND THAT -- THE COST AND SCHEDULE APPROVED DURING STAGE TWO ARE FAIRLY ACCURATE -- POLICY IN THE STATE AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT MANUAL ESTABLISH A THRESHOLD DURING STAGE FOR THAT ARE PROJECTS NOT MOVE FORWARD IF COST. ARE NOT WITHIN 20% OR FIVE MILLION WHICHEVER IS LESS OF THE STAGE TO ESTIMATES. SO IN THIS CASE DO THE WORK COMPLETED BY ABC DURING THE MARKET RESEARCH AND PLANNING PHASES. THE DEMONSTRATION FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR FUNDING WAS APPROPRIATE. AND BASED ON ABC'S RESEARCH ON CURRENT TRENDS IN THE RBS TRAINING MARKET WITHOUT THAT SPENT FROM THE STAGE TO DOCUMENTATION ARE REASONABLE. AND AS OUR INTENSE ONLY FROM THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROJECT. TO AVOID POTENTIAL DELAYS. AND ONCE A. B. C. COMPLETE STAGE FOR IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN ABC CAN REQUEST FUNDING FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THE THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. AND FURTHER THE LEGISLATURE WOULD RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF FINAL COSTS WHEN THE PROJECT WAS APPROVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE UPDATES. HE IS -- MONTHLY LEGISLATIVE MEETING. JUST ONE MORE QUESTION ON THE ON THE FUNDING IN THE FEES SO YOU CAN INCREASE THE LICENSING PLEASE [inaudible] CORRECT [inaudible] AND BECAUSE OF THE NEW PROGRAM THE SERVERS. YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE THE RBS PROGRAM THERE. CREASON FEES TO PAY FOR THAT PROJECT THE PROJECT IS SOLELY FUNDED BY FEES. PAID TO THE EXAM AND THEN PAID THROUGH LICENSING I'M THE PROVIDERS THEMSELVES BUT IT WOULDN'T BE. ALCOHOL LICENSEES THEMSELVES ARE NOT COMPARE HIGHER FEE TO THE DEPARTMENT. TO PAY FOR THE RBS PROGRAM NO I'M SAYING THE SERVERS THEMSELVES CRACKED ARE PAYING THE FEE. OR THEIR EMPLOYERS. BUT THEY'RE BUILT THEIR ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE ONES HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED YES OKAY -- VICTORIES IN THE THE LICENSING IS THAT. YOU'RE PROJECTING WHAT THESE LICENSING FEE INCREASES THAT THAT WILL BE ENOUGH TO COVER. THE NEW -- THE NEW ONES YES THE OLD BOX THE ORGAN IT'S NOT NEW YOU'VE BEEN HAVING THAT PROXIMALLY EIGHT NINE TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. RIGHT AND SO THAT'S GOING TO COVER THAT. CORRECT SO SO THAT WE FORWARD I GUESS WERE WERE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU'RE REQUESTING IS FOR STAFFING. NEW YOU KNOW AN INCREASE IN STAFFING. SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS IT. THE LICENSING FEES IT'S GOING TO COVER IT OR IS IT. FUNDING FROM OUR GENERAL FUND NO NO NO NO GENERAL FUND. ALL THIS ALL SPECIAL FUNDS ALL AND IN THIS OF THIS IS THIS IS MOSTLY IN THIS THE NEXT ITEM WHICH I CAN CHECK TO NARAL OR AND THEN I'LL ANSWER WAS I PROMISE YOU AND GO AHEAD -- IN ISSUE NUMBER THREE IN YOUR AGENDA THAT'S OUR PROGRAM PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE -- THIS IS A MULTI YEAR PLAN TO STRENGTHENS APARTMENT. FOR YOUR PLAN. AND PROVE OUR SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC YOUR STAKEHOLDERS THE PROPOSAL REQUEST THIRTY FOUR POSITIONS AND FIVE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR -- FROM THE ALCOHOL CONTROL BEVERAGE FUND WHICH IS AGAIN A LICENSING FEE FUND -- INCREASING TO A TOTAL OF FIFTY ONE POSITIONS AND SEVEN MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE I'M THERE'S A TRAILER BILL -- THAT ESSENTIALLY -- CONTAINS THE FEE INCREASES IT ALSO -- ALIGNS THE FEES AND THE WAY I WAS DESCRIBING TO TRY TO HAVE APPLICATION FEES COVER THE COSTS THE ABC'S COST ACTUALLY PROCESSING APPLICATION. AND THE RENEWAL FEES TO COVER THE COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE. NO ANSWER QUESTIONS. SO THE YES THE END OF THE FEES WERE PROPOSING THE TRAILER BILL COVER -- ARE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IT'S IT'S DOUBTS ABOUT 15%. INCREASE OF ARE THESE NOW AND THEN THE MODERNIZATION PORTION OF IT IS -- AN ADDITIONAL 14% OF WATER THESE ARE BASED ON RIGHT NOW. OKAY IT THEN. THAT SEEN IN IN OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT -- FOR YEARS THE BUDGET MODEL RELIES ON CP I INCREASES. WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE -- THE AUTHORITY WILL IMPOSE -- BUT THE BUDGET MODEL ITSELF DOES RELY UPON THE CPI INCREASE GOING FORWARD. SO WE WOULD AT THAT POINT MOVING FORWARD THESE FOUR YEARS ESSENTIALLY GROW OUR OUR STAFFING AND OUR PROGRAMS UP IS FOR PROPOSING. AND AND ESSENTIALLY HAVE A PREDICTABLE FEE STRUCTURE -- THAT WOULD NOT RELY ON ANY INCREASES OTHER THAN WHAT IS PROVIDED BY CPI. THE BILL WOULD BE CPI INCREASE BREAST IN THE FUTURE CORRECT. IN THE FEES. YES AND WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE HAD CPI INCREASES AUTHORITIES SINCE ABOUT -- TWO THOUSAND TO THREE AND THIS IS JUST. TION OF THOSE ALTHOUGH OUR INTENT IS TO DO IT ON A YEARLY PROJECT BASIS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] ANYMORE [inaudible] COMMENTS. NOT MUCH ADDITIONAL TO ADD WE HAVE A REYES SPECIFIC CONCERNS IT BUT AS WE WOULD NOTE THIS IS A PRETTY FAR REACHING -- PROPOSAL THAT INVOLVES BOTH FEE INCREASES AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT SO CERTAINLY THEIR NUMBER POLICY CONSIDERATIONS -- AND ALSO CERTAINLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT LEGISLATURE GONNA WATCH WHENI WATCH -- IN THE COMING YEARS -- TO TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THIS AND GET ALL THE BENEFITS THAT ARE PROMISE FROM THIS PROPOSAL -- AND JUST ONE FINAL WE WE WE TOUCHED ON THIS BUT IF NOT SAID. OF QUICKLY -- I RAISE A CONCERN ABOUTTHE ARREST OF MINORS WITH REGARDS TO THE ALCOHOL. POSITION UP WHILE I THINK IT'S GOOD IN THE SENSE OF ENFORCEMENT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT AND I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY. IT'S REALLY MORE FOR YOU AS WELL AS FOR THE THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- BUT MAYBE THERE IS YOU COULD JUST EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE TELL US ABOUT -- DETERRING. YOU KNOW. THIS KIND OF WAITING FOR THEM. TO ALL BLOOM ARRESTING THEM OR YOU KNOW REFERRING THEM BECAUSE IT IS CRIMINAL RIGHT IT IS A CRIMINAL JOINT IS HANDLE. IT YOU KNOW I DON'T WANNA DEFEND KIDS WHO GO AROUND DRINKING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I ALSO DON'T WANT IT TO BECOME. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE PIPELINE TO SURE RESORTS TO SO SO THE THE THAN THE MINERS RECITING IT'S FOR PURCHASING ALCOHOL IS FOR BEING IN POSSESSION IT'S FOR FAKE ID'S OUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE OF THE CITATIONS RE ISSUE. THERE WE ISSUED THEM AS MISDEMEANORS THAT'S WHAT OUR CODE SAYS BUT BUT BUT THEY'RE INVARIABLY PRESS PLAYED DOWN TO INFRACTIONS THAT REQUIRE THEM EITHER BY A FINE OR ENGAGE IN SOME SORT OF COMMUNITY SERVICE SO. YOU KNOW WE HOPE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM THEY LEARN A LESSON -- BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT SIDE OF SUBJECT FROM OBVIOUSLY FAR BROADER THAN THIS HEARING TODAY -- BUT WE DO DO A LOT WE WORK WITH PREVENTION GROUPS -- I WE WORK WITH FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE MAD SAD -- THE RECORDING ARTISTS AND ATHLETES CONSTRUCT DRIVING I SAID I'M ACTUALLY THE CO CHAIR THAT WE REALLY BILL RELIEF AND PREVENTION WE DO ALL THE THINGS WE CAN. OUR MOST POWERFUL TOOLS AND PREVENTION ARE REALLY TO TO EDUCATE OUR LICENSEES TO HAVE THEM. ALCOHOL AWAY FROM KIDS AND HOW THEY CAN AVOID SELLING TO THEM EITHER -- THROUGH COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS ARE HOW TO SPOT OF THOSE SPORTS. I MEAN I'M I'M A REMAINING VERY FRUSTRATING PROBLEMS SIGN COURSES. KIDS GET A LOT OUT ON IT'S NOT FROM THE LIQUOR STORE. OKAY. THING ELSE RIGHT WILL -- PUBLIC COMMENTS. SENATOR OZ OF CENTER OVER THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'M DR GERM COOLER I'M THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PARTNERSHIP -- WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE IN MAKING THEIR COMMUNITIES BETTER PLACES TO LIVE SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HAVE VERY STRONG PROGRAMS IN BOTH OF YOUR AREAS. I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH THE EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF ABC SENSE -- THE EARLY NINETIES AND THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT HAS TRULY BEEN SERIOUS ABOUT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND ENGAGING IN PREVENTION -- THE ABILITY TO MEET WITH THEM IN PERSON QUARTERLY. THE WILLINGNESS FOR THEM TO COME AND PARTICIPATE IN OUR EVENTS LOCALLY ALL OF WHICH MAKE THE RELATIONSHIP MUCH STRONGER. TO YOUR POINTOF CRIMINALIZING YOUTH ALCOHOL BEHAVIOR -- WE TO DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUTH DRINKING BUT AT THE SAME TIME EVERY TIME A YOUTH IS INVOLVED IN AN ALCOHOL INCIDENT. SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINES AN ADULT WAS INVOLVED. SO MOST OF THE TIME IT'S AT THEIR HOMES WHERE THEY FIND THE ALCOHOL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME TRAINING MERCHANTS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED IN PROGRAMS LOCALLY TO DO EDUCATION AND WITH ABC. A. RESPONSIBLE ALCOHOL MERCHANT WARD. SO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WILL GO OUT AND DO SURVEYS OF THEIR COMMUNITY. TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF ALCOHOL OUTLETS IN THEIR AREA. AND EDUCATE THOSE MERCHANTS ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO SELL OUT. COMMUNITY AND MAKE SURE IT ISN'T SOLD TO MINORS. SO THEY WILL INVITE THEM TO SIGN A MERCHANT PLEDGE WHICH IS IN ADDITION TO THE LICENSE THAT THEY HAVE. WHICH CLEARLY STATES IN THEIR COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE A GOOD PARTNER. TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN MAKING SURE THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF ALCOHOL IS RESTRICTED. AND IT'S FLOW TO THEM. WE ALSO FIND THAT MANY OF THE YOUTH WHO ARE THEN CITED FOR A MINOR IN POSSESSION. WELL ALSO THAT HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. AND THEN MAY CONNECT BACK TO OUR FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM TO BE INVOLVED IN A PEER GROUP THAT IS POSITIVE. AND ENGAGING AND GOOD ACTIVITIES SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS AND APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE. WITH A. B. C. AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE AND MAKING GOOD DECISIONS. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR PROGRAM AND ITS SUPPORT OF EFFORTS LOCALLY. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK OKAY -- A HOLE IN THE SIDE OF OPEN SO I APPRECIATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FUTURE FOR ALL YOU DOING THEM FOR ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO. SO THAT CLIP. HE SAID IT WAS YOUR FAULT. OKAY WOULD HAVE NEXT YEAR. THERE'S ONLY ONE RIGHT YEAH. YES -- THIS IS WILL BE THE OKAY -- JUST. WE WILL GET IT IN SOMEWHERE BECAUSE I ALSO WANT TO JUMP. TO I WILL DO THAT OKAY -- ISSUE NUMBER FOUR THIS IS THE CAL STIRS SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT [inaudible] THE MORNING. I CAN MORNING MADAM CHAIR GABBY SAN TOWARD PART IN FINANCE -- SO AS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- IT IS PROPOSED. TO MAKE PAYMENTS IN ADDITION TO WHAT STATUTORY REQUIRED TO BUY DOWN THE UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY FOR CAL STEARNS -- SO THERE'S TWO PIECES THE FIRST PIECE IS TO BUY DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THAT'S ATTRIBUTED TO THE STATE OF FOR THE CL STIRS DEFINED BENEFIT PROGRAM -- WE'RE PROPOSING A TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT OVER FISCAL YEARS IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THESE PAYMENTS WILL RESULT IN A SAVINGS OF SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. AS BUT SEE I HAVE WE JUST WANTED TO IN RESPONSE TO ADD SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE AGENDA ITEM -- THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT SORT OF THE PROBABILITY OF WHEN THE SAVINGS WE GET ACHIEVED -- WON THE NOTE THAT THERE IS AN 82% PROBABILITY THAT THE SAVINGS WILL BE ACHIEVED WITHIN THE NEXT THREE DECADES -- I SHOULD CAVEAT THAT THERE IS AN EXISTING FUNDING PLAN FOR CAL STIRS I'M AT FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE WAS PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I JUST SORT OF RESTRUCTURED THE FUNDING -- BETWEEN THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHICH ARE THE STATE A SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE EMPLOYERS AND THE MEMBERS OF CAL STIRS. UP -- TO ELIMINATE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR THE TV PROGRAM I BY -- TWENTY FORTY SIX SO THERE IS THAT THERE IS A EIGHTY TWO PERCEPTIBLE DELAY THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE SAVINGS WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD HOWEVER THERE IS A CHANCE THAT. THE SAVINGS WILL BE REALIZED AFTER WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT -- THEY'RE ALWAYS BE SAVINGS REALIZED AS A RESULT OF THIS PAYMENT -- IT'S JUST THERE'S NOT COMPLETE CERTAINTY THAT WILL REALIZE THAT WITH AND THAT SORT OF TIME PERIOD. AT THE NEXT PIECE IS A A PROPOSED THREE BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT I SHOULD BACKTRACK BUT THE TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT IS BEING PROPOSED THROUGH. AVAILABLE PROPOSITION TO DEBT REPAYMENT FUNDING. AB AND I'VE ALTERNATIVELY THERE IS A PROPOSED THREE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND PAYMENT -- TOWARDS THE CASTERS FIND BENEFIT PROGRAM I BEHALF OF A SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- OF THE ENTIRE PAYMENT TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE PAID AS AN ACTUAL SUPPLEMENT PENSION PAYMENT ON TOP OF WHAT. ARE REQUIRED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- THE REMAINING SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION WE'RE PROPOSING TO BE PAID US THE AS A PLANNING PAYMENT THAT IN THAT. I BUDGET YOU'RE IN BUT YOU'RE PLUS -- ONE TO REPLACE WHAT THEY WOULD BE AND PAYING OTHER WHITES WERE BY THE SCHOOL TRICKS DISTRICTS SOME RELIEF. AND THIS IS ESTIMATED TO RESULT IN A 1% DECREASE AND CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THOSE TWO YEARS -- OVERALL WE ARE EXPECTING THAT SAVINGS TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS A RESULT RESULT OF THIS PAYMENT WILL BE SIX POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS -- AND THEN FOR FOR BOTH OF THESE PAYMENTS WE WANT TO NOTE THAT THE WAY THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO AUTHORIZE IT IS STRUCTURED -- ALLOWS FINANCE SORT OF FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE BY AND THAT THE TRANCERS BE AFFECTION WAITED BUT THIS IS -- THIS PAYMENT WILL BE ATTRIBUTED TO A TWENTY NINTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GENERAL FUND AVAILABLE FUNDING [inaudible] OKAY -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M SO YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE A HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU -- WHICH WILL COVER ACTUALLY THE THE FOLLOWING THREE ITEMS IN YOUR AGENDA ISSUE FOUR FIVE AND SIX I AM SO. PAGE ONE IS JUST GONNA CONCERNS THIS ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. THE NUMBER IS -- DO YOU HAVE ALREADY DID A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL BUT OUR NUMBERS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON HOW -- THIS PROPOSAL WOULD WORK SO ANY KIND OF GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND. THREE PAYMENTS RELATED TO HOLLISTER IS -- BY THE STATE. THE FIRST IS A ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TO PAY DOWN THE STATE'S SHARE OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY AS DEPARTMENT FINANCE ARE DENOTED THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF CASTERS. IS SHARED UNDER STATE LAW -- BY BOTH THE STATE AND ALSO DISTRICTS AND MEMBERS. ARE THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT THAT THE STATE WOULD MAKE ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICTS CHAIR OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT A SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS THAT'S SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT WOULD NOT COVER THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IT WOULD BE INSTEAD OF WHAT DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE SPENT OTHERWISE ON THEIR PENSION PAYMENTS -- BUT YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT FINANCE ALREADY NOTED IT BUT I'LL JUST REITERATE. THAT. BY CONTRAST TO THE DISTRICTS PAYMENT WHICH HAS AN OVER 99% CHANCE OF ACHIEVING SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES THE PAYMENT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE'S SHARE OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY HAS ABOUT AN 80% CHANCE OF ACHIEVING SAVINGS. OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES OR A SAVINGS. OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES -- AND THEN FINALLY JUST ON THE DISTRICTS RATE RELIEF WE WOULD NOTE THAT YOU KNOW PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. COULD DECLINE IN THE COMING YEARS IF THE STATE FACES A RECESSION AND WHILE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY FACE SOME FINANCIAL PRESSURES TODAY THEY MAY FACE EVEN MORE FINANCIAL PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE. AND SO IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING FOR RATE RELIEF FOR A TIME WHEN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING HAS DECLINED. OKAY ANY RESPONSE -- MY LET'S GO AT I GUESS IT SO. FOR THE OUR PROPOSAL TO MAKE THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS OVER TWO YEARS FOR THIS UPCOMING BUT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR PLUS ONE THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PRESSED REQUEST FOR RELIEF NOW -- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT OF THE FURTHER OUT WE DELAY THESE PAYMENTS THE LESS OF AN EFFECT THAT WILL BE MAKE WILL BE MAKING ON IT BECAUSE IT'S CONTRIBUTIONS ARE BASED ON BASICALLY PAYROLL AND I HEAR ALL GROWS THE BE LESS OF AN EFFECT -- BUT SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT TO BE DEDICATED ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I DO THOUGH THINK THOUGH THERE IS. THAT ISSUE OF AS EXPECTED THERE'S GOING TO BE LESS FUNDING. BY -- SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW EVERYBODY SAYING -- THE ECONOMY'S GONNA. SLOW DOWN OR WE JUST GONNA HAVE LESS FUNDING AND THEN IT'S REALLY GOOD TO BE A BIGGER CRISIS. WITH THE DISTRICTS SO QUESTION IS AND WITH THE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S VISION OF LOOKING AHEAD HOW DO YOU PREPARE -- I DO THINK THERE IS A A VERY VERY STRONG ARGUMENT TO BE MADE ABOUT. HOLDING HOLDING OFF ON GIVING THAT. IN ORDER TO GIVE IT SET IT ASIDE AND GIVE IT WHEN IT'S MORE. I THINK MORE DRAMATICALLY NEEDED -- SO I THINK THERE'S A REALLY LEGITIMATE POINT TO BE MADE. YES A GOOD MORNING A DAVID LARA FROM THE HOUSE NO NO WORRIES OUR DOORS HAVE WAS HERE MOST IT AS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. VOTE IN THIS REGION ALLEY WE DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE PROPOSAL IT WOULD HELP. LOWER OUR EXISTING UNFUNDED LIABILITY WHICH IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVEN BILLION. SAID WITH THE THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE NEXT YUBA LOWERED BY ABOUT THREE POINT FOUR BILLION. AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A NUMBER ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION SO OVERALL IT WOULD LOWER ABOUT BY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION. AND PROVIDE BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM RATES RELIEF AND JUST WHAT ALSO SAID IF WE AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT ABOUT THE STATE PROPOSED PAYMENTS. DUE TO THE STRUCTURE OF OUR FUNDING PLAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TELLING EVERYONE IS -- FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE STATE EVEN IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUND WE DON'T EXPECT SAVINGS TO MATERIALIZE FOR THE STATE UNTIL FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THIS IS WHY THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE SAVINGS THE SAVINGS WILL OCCUR THERE'S A GUARANTEE TO WILL OCCUR WHAT IS UNCERTAIN AS TO TIMING. WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE. SO WITH THIS I WOULD BE HAPPY. ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON CAL STORES AT A PROPOSAL FOR ALL THIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION IS IS FRIGHTENING AND DEPRESSING BUT OF GLAD THAT WE'RE AT LEAST DRESSING IN SOME PART. MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN -- ALEJO HOW IT IS THAT THERE'S A 20% CHANCE THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY SAVINGS AND IN QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT. WELL I WILL -- I'LL DEFER TO CAL STARS -- FOR A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION -- BUT IT'S NOT A TWENTY FORTY SIX AND THAT THERE WOULD BE SAVINGS AFTER THAT POINT BUT OF COURSE THAT'S IN A FEW DECADES FROM NOW SO LET ME ALL DIFFERENT TO JUST ALL OF TRIED TO GIVE YOU A A SHORT THEN THE BRIEF EXPLANATION BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU TRY TO FUND. A PENSION FUND. A PENSION PLAN ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENT IS AND YOU OFTEN HEAR ABOUT IT THIS YOU HEAR ABOUT CALPERS AND CAL STIRS EXPECT EARNS 7% LONG TERM. ONE OF THE SO WHEN WE FUN. AS YOU KNOW YOU PROBABLY ALL HAVE MONEY INVESTED IN FOR ONE CASE. HAS BEEN MARKETS THE INVESTMENT RETURNS ON NOT ALWAYS 7%. IN FACT I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER OWN SEVEN WE ARE IN MORE OR LESS AND WHAT WE NORMALLY DO AS PART OF THE FUNDING IS. IF LET'S SAY YOU EARN LESS THAN. SEVEN YOU DID NOT MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS. IF YOU WANT TO STAY ON TRACK WITH YOUR FUNDING. DO YOU NEED TO HAVE A MECHANISM TO MAKE UP THAT SHORTFALL IF YOU WANTED TO MECHANISM WE NOW HAVE A CAL STIRS. THROUGH THE COST WAS FUNDING PLAN IS WE ARE ABLE TO ADJUST CONTRIBUTION RATES AND IN THESE CASES WE WOULD MEAN WE WOULD NORMALLY ASK THE STATE. TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE AS PART OF A FUNDING PLAN. THERE WERE SOME -- SOME RULES WERE PUT INTO PLACE FOR OUR BOARD CAN ONLY INCREASED THE STATE CONTRIBUTION RATE BY HALF A PERCENT PER YEAR. OF IT HAS SOME ADVANTAGES BECAUSE IT PROVIDES MORE BUDGET STABILITY TO THE STATE ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES IF THERE IS A NEED TO INCREASE THE RATE BY 2%. IT WILL TAKE US FOR YEARS BEFORE WE DO IT. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS THERE COULD BE A SITUATION IF WE WERE TO GO WITH WERE LOW PERIOD OF INVESTMENT RETURNS WHERE. THE MONEY GIVEN BY THE STATE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE. TO ACTUALLY A PROVIDER RATE RELIEF TO THE STATE BECAUSE OF THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR MAYBE LET'S SEE TEN OR TWENTY YEARS. IT'S ALSO THAT THE REASON WHY DOT THIS 20% PROBABILITY WAS DERIVED FROM A MODEL THAT WE HAVE A CAL STIRS THAT SIMULATES POTENTIAL FUTURE OF THE INVESTMENT A WORLD. SO THERE IS A LET'S SAY LIKE SOMETIME WE OFTEN TELL OUR BOARD THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY 25% CHANCE THAT WE MAY ARMED EIGHT FIVE POINT 5% FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. SAID THIS SCENARIO WHERE TO MATERIALIZE. IT WOULD LEAD TO A SITUATION WHERE OUR BOARD WOULD BE REQUIRED A WOULD BE ASKED TO INCREASE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION RATE EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. AND THIS ADDITIONAL CON THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WOULD NEVER. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE SAVINGS TO THE STATE THEY WOULD ALWAYS MATERIALS IN SAVINGS OVER TIME BUT FOR THIS ANALYSIS. SAVINGS WERE MEASURED THROUGHOUT THE LIFE MCALISTER'S FUNDING PLAN WHICH IS TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY SIX SO IT'S SORT OF DIRECTLY RELATED TO INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE COUNSELORS FUNDS OF IT'S IT'S A IT'S A VERY. SIMPLE MIND THE ACT THE VARIABLE IS THE RATE OF RETURN CORRECT YOU IF YOU DON'T HIT THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN. THEN YOU YOU WON'T HIT YOUR EXPECTATIONS OBVIOUSLY AND THAT THERE'S A 20% CHANCE THAT YOU WON'T HIT THAT BEFORE TWENTY FORTY SIX IS THAT. ACCURATE. NO I THINK IT'S MORE THERE'S A LOW ENOUGH IT MAY NOT ALLOW THE STATE TO VISIT TO TO THE PENNY SAME SO IT WILL HAVE TO BE MORE LIKE YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THE 5% RANGE THEN IT WOULD. NOT ALLOWED TO STATE TO READ TO TO BASICALLY YEAH. IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED FUNDING PLAN WE HAVE SO THE TO CREATE SOME [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. I THINK WE'RE GOOD. WELL. WITH. NIXON'S CALPERS. OKAY NO CALPERS [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR -- SO THAT THIS WAS PART OF THAT THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. UP THE WE HAVE PROPOSED A THREE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND LITTLE PENSION PAYMENT TO CALPERS -- IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OF THE PROPOSAL WE WILL BE AB DEDICATING V. AND THE PAYMENT. TO HELP OUR STATE PLANS BASED ON THE SHARE OF EACH PLANS. GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE FUNDED I TYPICALLY -- IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THESE -- THIS PAYMENT WILL RESULT IN A SAVINGS OF SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT THREE DECADES. I'M WHICH WILL BRING DOWN THE CONTRIBUTION RIGHT TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF TO STATE DEPARTMENT -- FOR BIRD PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS. OF I ALSO WANTED. TO RESPOND TO SOME COMMON ALSO MADE AND AND THE AGENDA. OF THEIR THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT -- SORT OF THE EQUITY OF THE GENERAL FUND IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE PAYMENT BUT WOULDN'T BE SAVINGS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY OTHER FUNDS THAT. THE PAY INTO THESE FIVE STATE PLANS -- WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WITH A PROPOSAL SO SORT OF RECONCILE -- MAKING SURE THAT THE JONATHAN DOES RECEIVE SOME OF THE BENEFIT THAT IT PERTAINS BUT ALSO NOT PROVIDING OR NOT I HAVE PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON OTHER FUNDS -- RELATED TO THE PROPOSAL -- STIFFER REFERENCE A DEFECT IN THE AGENDA ITEM WE DID -- PREVIOUSLY MAKE A SIX BILLION DOLLAR OF THE MODEL PENSION PAYMENT TO CALPERS I'M IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN I'M THIS PYMENT WAS MADE THROUGH A LOAN THAT WAS TAKEN OUT FROMTHE SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT FUND WHICH HOUSES -- EXCESS CASH RESERVES OF FOR ALL STATE DEPARTMENT OR STATE FUNDS -- SO SO THIS AT THE WAY THAT WE STRUCTURED THE SIX BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT A COUPLE YOUR LETTER LAST YEAR -- IT WAS TO BE DEDICATED TOWARDS THAT THE COST OF A DECISION THAT WAS MADE BY THE CALPERS BOARD A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TO REDUCE THEIR SOON RATED IT MUST RETURN -- BY REDUCING THAT SEEM GREAT RETURN THERE'S A GAP NOW OF OF FUNDING THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO THE TO AT PENSIONS WHICH AND HAS TO BE FILLED BY EMPLOYERS SUCH AS THE ALL WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S -- SO THE WAY THAT THE INDUSTRY CAME IT WAS STRUCTURED. IT ALLOWED AND IT RESULTED IN SAVINGS THAT BANDS THAT WERE LARGER OVER A SHORT PERIOD TIME FOR WHICH THE TIME THAT ALL FUNDS WERE EXPECTED TO REPAY THE LOAN THAT FUNDED IT -- ALTERNATIVELY -- THIS PROPOSED PAYMENT IT'S IT'S BEING PAID TO PROVIDE DOLLARS IS BEING PAID OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SO WILL BE MORE IN SAVINGS BUT YOU WON'T SEE AS MANY SAVINGS OR BOARD SORT OF THE NEXT TEN YEARS WHICH IS -- OVER THE TIME PERIOD THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY AFFECTS WITH ALONE -- SO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE DECISION TO NOT INTRODUCE ALONE COMPONENT TO HAVE OTHER FUNDS REPAY FOR THEIR SHARE THE BENEFIT THAT THE GENERAL FUND IS MAKING -- IS BECAUSE WE SEE A TO A PORTION AND PROPORTIONATELY LOWER BENEFIT OVER THIS HYPOTHETICAL LOAN REPAYMENT TERM THAT WOULD PROVIDE LEAP RELIEF TO THEM AS THE REPAYING THE LOAN -- OKAY SO THE SECOND PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT PROVIDES OUR COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL -- JUST TO KIND OF REITERATE A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT OF THE BACKGROUND TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT -- USING GENERAL FUND FUNDING AND DISTRIBUTING DISTRIBUTING IT AMONG -- FOUR OF THE FIVE PLANS WITHIN CALPERS SO CALPERS IS NOT JUST ONE PLAN IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON DON'T YOU KNOW DIFFERENT KINDS -- CLASSIFICATIONS OF STATE EMPLOYEES OF FOR EXAMPLE PEACE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS HAVE ONE PLAN WITHIN CALPERS. HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN. I'M SO THE FIVE BILLION THAT'S RIGHT THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AS THE TABLE SHOWS IN THE FIRST COLUMN AND IT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO THOSE PLANS THAT RECEIVE GENERAL FUND PAYMENT OF FOUR OF THE FIVE EXCLUDING HIGHWAY PATROL. THE NET SAVINGS THAT WOULD BE REALIZED AS A RESULT OF THIS PLAN ARE IN THE FINAL COLUMN OF THE TABLE AND SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WOULD IN SAVINGS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG. FOUR OF THOSE PLANS. THE GENERAL FUND WOULD RECEIVE ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS AND THEN OTHER FUNDS INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE AND SPECIAL FUNDS. WOULD RECEIVE THE REMAINING THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. BUT NOTABLY THE BECAUSE HIGHWAY PATOL IS EXCLUDED FROM THE PLAN BECAUSE IT DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY GENERAL FUND PAYMENTS THAT'S WHY IT'S EXCLUDED FROM THE PLAN -- THE MAJOR FUND THAT PAYS HIGHWAY PATROL OUT PENSION COSTS IS THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR FUNDS IT PAYS IT. AND SO MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT AS A RESULT -- ACHIEVES LESS SAVINGS THAN IT WOULD UNDER AN ALTERNATIVE WHERE HIGHWAY PATROL WERE INCLUDED IN THE PLAN. SO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE PROVIDES OUR ASSESSMENT -- WE NOTE THAT YOU KNOW IN CONTRAST TO THE DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD ABOUT CAL STARS WERE RE SAID THERE WAS ONLY AN 80% CHANCE OF ACHIEVING SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. THIS CALPERS PLAN HAS OVER 99% CHANCE OF ACHIEVING SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES. IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW IT -- IS AT AND YOU KNOW A AND A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT. YEAH THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE RATE SETTING AUTHORITY -- BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS -- SO WALL CALPERS. CITING AUTHORITY AND IF IT EXPERIENCES AND INVESTMENT LOSSES WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT WITH CAL STAR IS A CAN ADJUST THE RATES CORRESPONDINGLY AND MAKE UP FOR THAT LOSS -- CAL STARS DOES NOT HAVE THAT FULL LATITUDE -- UNDER STATE LAW. BUT ON ANYTHING. SO IF IT. GOES BELOW AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BELOW THE SEVEN YASSER BECAUSE BELOW THE SEVEN THEN ALL I CAN. SAY. WELL ARE THE ULTIMATE SAVINGS -- WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF SIX POINT THREE ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE BASED ON WHAT THE FUND ACTUALLY OR INSULT. THAT IS A VARIABLE AS TO HOW MUCH YOU WILL SAVE BUT UNLIKE THE CASTER SITUATION IT'S VIRTUALLY GUARANTEE THAT THERE WILL BE SAVINGS. OF JUST DEPENDING ON HOW GOOD THE RETURNS ARE. AGAIN IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT ABILITY. TWO CAN MAKE UP A LOT AS A MAKE UP FOR THEM YEAR AFTER YEAR BY YEAR. WE WE S. OF CALPERS IS NOT HAVE THE RESTRICTIONS THAT MR LAMBRO TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN ONLY INCREASE THE RATE BY HALF PERCENT PER YEAR. IF WE NEED TO WE INCREASE THE RATES AND THE SO YEAH WE FORWARD SETTING AUTHORITY AND THAT IS WHY -- ONCE THE MONEY IS IN THE PLAN THE ADDITIONAL EARNINGS THEY GENERATE WHATEVER THEY ARE WILL BE A SAVINGS [inaudible] SENATORS. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU IT. MORE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY. I DON'T THINK SO NO OKAY. I JUST SPOKE I'M SORRY COULD YOU CLARIFY. OF THE CAL -- I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. YES RIGHT I'M SORRY COULD JUMP BACK SURE YEAH. I JUST AT A HIGH LEVEL SO WE IT AND WE ARE PROPOSING AT A PAYMENT TOWARDS. THE CASTER SYSTEM NOT THE CALPERS SCHOOL CLASSIFY PLAN I WANT TO NOTE THAT THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR IF THE CLASS I SCHOOL PLAN THAT CALPERS IS -- IS MUCH SMALLER THAN UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR CAL STIRS SO THE ART OUR INTENTION IS TO SORT OF DEDICATE THE PAYMENT TOWARDS THE BIGGER UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND WE WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS WOULD ALSO MAKE WHISKEY WOULD BE IMPACTING SCHOOL EMPLOYERS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER GOES TO THE CALPERS SCHOOL PLAN OR THROUGH CAL STIRS. ALL RIGHT. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ISSUE. SIX WORLD TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND CALPERS [inaudible] FIFTY FOUR YES. CAMPAIGN. YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M PATRICK CAMPING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- MAN CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU INCLUDES. THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU INCLUDES CURRENT YEAR FUNDING TO PAY OFF TWO OF THE STATE'S LONG STANDING DEBTS -- WHICH ARE THE JUNE TO JULY PAYROLL DEFERRAL AND THE CALPERS FOURTH QUARTER DEFERRAL -- LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND BACK DURING THE RECESSION -- THE STATE NEEDED SOME MONEY SO IT LOOKED AT THE LAST TWO BILLS THAT HAD TO PAY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WHICH WAS. JUNE PAYROLL AND THIS -- FOURTH QUARTER. AMEN TO CALPERS AND THEY PUNTED THOSE THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR SO -- DURING THE SESSION IS A MONEY THE ONLY PAID ELEVEN MONTHS OF PAYROLL AND ONLY PAID. THREE QUARTERS OF THIS PAYMENT THIS IS. KIND OF OFF THE BOOKS THIS IS TRANSPARENT FOR DEPARTMENTS STATE EMPLOYEES STILL GOT PAID -- CALPERS STILL GOT THEIR FUNDING PAYMENT SO. USER REALLY BUDGET GIMMICKS -- THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE -- SO -- THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND. NINE SORRY NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE MILLION. MILES IN THE NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE MILLION OF GENERAL FUND. SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION OF GENERAL FUND FOR THESE -- CALPERS DEFERRAL -- THE REASON WE WANT TO THE MAIN REASON WE WANT TO PAY THIS OFF OTHER THAN. JUST BEING GOOD THIS CALL POLICY IS -- DUE TO SOME FUNDING CHEST THAT OCCURRED MOVING -- THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM GENERAL FUND PAYROLL TO OTHER FUNDS. IS THIS RESULTS AND THE STUFF FOR THE JUNE JULY PAYROLL TO FOR ALL BEING. THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CHEAPER THIS YEAR. SO BARRING ANY OTHER. FUNDING SHIFT OF THIS MAGNITUDE WHICH WE DON'T FORESEE HAPPENING. THIS IS. AS CHEAP AS THIS IS GOING TO GET THIS YEAR IT'S IT'S ON SALE RIGHT NOW BASICALLY [inaudible] SO -- IS THE PHONE IN THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE -- RELATED TO EITHER OF THESE DEBTS. AS TO THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT PROVIDES OUR COMMENTS ON THESE TWO DEFERRALS -- AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE I AM SHOWING A SUMMARY OF ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING TO FOR ALSO THE CAN STATE HOUSE AND ESSENTIALLY THIS IS BECAUSE WE LAID OUT ANALYSIS RECENTLY WORRISOME OF COMPARED. THE DEFERRALS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES I'M DOING AGAINST SOME OF THE OTHER TO FOR ALL OF THE STATE ALREADY HAS A THAT THE STATE ARE STILL HAS -- ON THE BOOKS SO BUT I WILL ALSO ADD THAT THE STATE HAD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEFERRALS RELATED TO EDUCATION PREVIOUSLY THAT HAVE ALL BEEN -- TOTALLY REPAID SO THE STATE HAS ALSO MADE IMPORTANT PROGRESS IN THIS AREA -- SINCE THE LAST RECESSION THE THREE REMAINING CATEGORIES OF PEARLS THAT ARE STILL OUTSTANDING ARE THE PENSION AND PAYROLL DEFERRALS AS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED REPAYING BUT THEN ALSO A SET OF DEFERRALS. RELATED TO THE MEDIC HEALTH PROGRAM -- AND THE WAY THAT BOTH THE PROGRAM IS BUDGET AND ALSO HOW -- COSTS ARE PAID WITHIN THAT PROGRAM. SO -- OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOUND -- THAT WE EVALUATED THE PROPOSAL ESSENTIALLY ON THREE DIFFERENT CRITERIA. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES IT IMPROVE THE STATE'S FISCAL POSITION TO WHAT EXTENT DOES IT IMPROVE SORT OF TRANSPARENCY AND STATE BUDGETING PRACTICES. AND THEN TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT REDUCE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON OTHER ENTITIES. SO I'M DOING THESE TWO DEFERRALS OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES WOULD IMPROVE THE STATE'S -- FISCAL POSITION BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY BY UNDOING THESE DEFERRALS TODAY IT GIVES THE STATE THE OPTION TO DO THEM AGAIN IN THE FUTURE WHICH HAS SOMETHING LIKE A BENEFIT SIMILAR TO RESERVES. IT ALSO MODERATELY IMPROVES THE STATE'S FISCAL POSITION I'M SORRY OP FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY AND BUDGETING PRACTICES. BECAUSE IT BRINGS OUR ACCOUNTING DOCUMENTS INTO ALIGNMENT WITH BUDGETARY DOCUMENTS. BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON OTHER ENTITIES -- THAT'S BECAUSE STATE EMPLOYEES ARE STILL PAID RIGHT ON TIME ARE THE PAYROLL DEFERRALS REALLY JUST AN ACCOUNTING ACTION. AND WITH RESPECT TO THE PENSION TO FOR ALL CALPERS HAS INDICATED THAT THERE REALLY IN DIFFERENT BETWEEN RECEIVING THEIR PAYMENT YOU KNOW IF AT THE END OF JUNE VERSES IN A FEW DAYS LATER AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY. SO WE LOOKED INTO THESE OTHER DEFERRALS AND ASKED YOU KNOW DO THEY USE PERFORMED BETTER AGAINST THESE. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT UNLIKE THE TO THE PENSION A PENSION PAYROLL TO FOR ALL THE DON'T HAVE THESE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. BUT THERE IS ONE SET OF DEFERRALS WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THAT IS HAVING SOME LIMITED ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR PROVIDERS. SPECIFICALLY RURAL HOSPITALS IN PARTICULAR -- AND PROVIDERS A FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES WHERE IS -- AS A RESULT OF THE DELAYED PAYMENTS THEY CAN FACE SOME CASH FLOW ISSUES I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IS BUT IT IT IT IT DOES HAVING SOME LIMITED MET -- ADVERSE EFFECTS. SO WE HAVE A RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVE WHICH WOULD BE -- TO NOT USE THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO UNDO. THE CALPERS -- DEFERRAL AND THE PAYROLL TO FOR ALL. AND TO INSTEAD ON DO THESE SPECIFIC DEFERRALS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THAT ARE HAVING THESE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD COST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION. AND USE THE REMAINING FUNDS TO BUILD MORE RESERVES BUILDING MORE RESERVES -- WOULD BE. WHAT DID SHE OF JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THAT GENERAL FUND SAVINGS ON AN ONGOING BASIS THAN ON DOING THESE DEFERRALS -- IT WOULD BE LESS ADMINISTRATIVELY COMPLEX TO IMPLEMENT THAN ON DOING DEFERRALS AND THEN RE DOING THEM AGAIN THE FUTURE AND OF COURSE AS I ALREADY MENTIONED THIS HAS THE ADDED ADVANTAGE OF REDUCING THOSE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME MEDICAL PROVIDERS. YES SORRY I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE HAND OUT BUT JUST A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO SPEAK -- TO I DON'T [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] NO [inaudible] ANDERSON THANK -- YES SO. S. SPEAKING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE -- SAYS WITH ON DOING SOME OF THESE DEFERRALS -- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE AND DOING THE MEDI CAL THE FOR ALL I DON'T. THAT'S A I GET TO PLAY THERE I GUESS. BUT WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY SOME ONE DAY -- BUT I DO WANT TO SPEAK -- TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE EASE OF ON DOING THESE DEFERRALS THAT I DO KNOW ABOUT -- I'M DOING THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE KIND OF OFF THE BOOKS AND THE WAY THEY'RE ADMINISTERED. THERE ARE SIMPLE IS JUST. NOT WE JUST DON'T DO THEM. IT'S DONE THE WORKLOAD GOES WAY THAT THAT GOES AWAY. THIS IS PRETTY MUCH AS ADMINISTRATIVELY SPEAKING THIS IS ALMOST AS EASY AS IT GETS ITS WORST. AND THAT'S PART OF WHY WE WE LOOK AT THESE TO FOR ALL THIS IS KIND OF LOW HANGING. FOR RIGHT NOW FOR US AS FAR AS PAYING OFF DEBTS -- THE LA -- DATES IN THE RIGHT OUT IN THE RIGHT UP TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE MACCALLUM WANT -- THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE ADMINISTRATIVELY DIFFICULT TO UNWIND AGAIN I DON'T WANT. TO SPEAK TO THAT -- SO THAT'S ONE THING WITH THIS ONE AND THEN WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT. SAVINGS WITH THESE DEFERRALS BUT THE WAY THE PENSION TO FOR A WORKS AND THE JUNE TO JULY PAYROLL THE FOR THE FOR A WORKS IS. IT. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT THIS AS SAVINGS SO AS AS PAYROLL INCREASES YES YOU ARE DIFFERENT MORE -- GENERAL FUND DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. BUT THAT DEFERRAL IS REALLY JUST THE DAT GROWING IT'S NOT. TRUE WE DON'T LOOK AT IT IS TRUE SAVINGS SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING. ONE THROUGHOUT THE EARNED OKAY [inaudible] YOU UNDERSTAND. OF NOTE THEN ACTUALLY. THE SERVER RUNS THAT THAT'S KIND OF MY POINT. IS THE IF YOU TO TALK ABOUT THIS IF YOU TRY TO COME TO SOME SO YOU HAVE I SEE HEAD SHAKING. YEAH AFFIRMATIVE AND I'M I THINK. OUR PARTNERS OF THE LA -- WE'VE. BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S YOUR PRAGUE HAVE ON HOW. WE WANT. TO WHAT YOU WANT TO PAY OFF AND HOW YOU WANT TO SPEND THIS THE THE THE THE MAIN THING THAT I THINK WE WANT TO COMMUNICATE. WITH THESE DEFERRALS AGAIN THEY'VE KIND OF CROSS OVER TO MEDIC OUR AND I DON'T GO. BUT THE MAIN THING WITH THESE AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE'S SOME APPETITE FOR THIS RIGHT NOW IS -- I I I WANT TO REITERATE THAT. THAT THIS IS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CHEAPER THIS YEAR. IT WILL NEVER IT WILL NOT BE THIS CHEAP AGAIN. I WAS A CHEAP I MEAN WE'RE TALKING THE LESS EXPENSIVE THEM BUT ANY ES IN YOUR AND YOUR RESPONSE THAT IS. IT'S NOT MY INTENTION TO OVERSTATE OUR DIFFERENCES HERE I THINK -- YOU KNOW AS WE'VE SAID SORT OF AND BROADER BIGGER PICTURE REPORTS WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH THIS YEAR TO ADDRESS -- SO THE STATE'S OUTSTANDING DEBTS AND LIABILITIES USING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE SURPLUS AND SO. REALLY WE'RE JUST PRESENTING SOME ALTERNATIVES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION THAT MIGHT MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE FISCAL SENSE -- BUT I IT'S NOT MY INTENTION TO OVERSEE THE DIFFERENCES BECAUSE WE DO GENERALLY HAVE YOU KNOW A POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH. THIS IS JUST FOR ME. YOU GUYS BOTH SEEM EXTREMELY SMART. THE THESE THE I AM HAVING A HARD TIME SORT OF TELLING THE DIFFERENCE -- AND AND I AND I APPRECIATE YOU GIVE US A HAND OUT WITH ADVANTAGES IN THE ALTERNATE RECOMMENDATION I JUST. IT IS A POLICY MATTER ACT. MAYBE JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND SO MAYBE IF IT'S BROKEN DOWN FURTHER. JERRY I WILL BE ABLE TO SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. JUST JUST HARD FOR ME TO SEE IT MENTIONED DISADVANTAGES. HELLO MY COLLEAGUES LIKE BUT YES SO -- SPEAKING TO THESE ALL HAVE TO THINK WE'RE HOLDING THIS WE WILL ALSO OPEN SO WE I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT AS WE SIT HERE -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT I CAN TALK TO SOME OF OUR MEDI CAL FOLKS AND SEE KIND OF WHAT THEIR WAY IN IS ON THE LA US PROPOSAL AND SEE -- ADMIN I THINK OUR MAIN CONCERN WITH IT IS HOW ADMINISTRATIVELY IT WOULD WORK TO UNWIND THAT. DEFERRAL COMPARED TO THE THIS -- BUT I CAN GET SOME MORE INFORMATION TO YOU I'M NOT A PROBABLY I DON'T SPEAK FOR THEM BUT ALL. I'LL SEE WHAT KIND OF THAT SOMEBODY KNOWS MORE ABOUT IT THAN I DO. FOR THE CHAIR OR MAYBE THERE'S SOME IS IT MORE COMPLICATED TO DO SOME HYBRID. OF THIS. SOMETHING THAT WOULD ADDRESS -- THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS THE ISSUES AT THAT THEY'RE FACING. UP I'M JUST. AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING THE TECHNICALITIES BUT IT SEEMS TO ME. THE IF WE CAN BE HELPFUL. TO THOSE MEDI CAL OF PROVIDERS THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO -- NOT JUST [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THE JUST THE SAVINGS PART OF IT BUT ACTUALLY DO SOME GOOD BECAUSE MEDICAL PROVIDERS IN THE ISSUES OF THE PROBLEMS THEY FACE ARE ALWAYS COMING UP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IT SEEMS TO ME. IT'S NICE TO HEAR THAT THERE IS A WAY. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY. MAKE THESE KINDS OF CONNECTIONS SO. MAYBE IT MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED BUT IF IT DOES THAT ANOTHER GOOD. OR PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND DIGITAL LOOK AT CHECK OKAY. YES. TO MAKE LIFE MORE COMPLICATED. IT'S A SECURE FOR RIGHT YES. ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH THANK YOU BRIDGET. YES LET'S -- THIS. YEAH I CERTAINLY I CERTAINLY OKAY THE OKAY GOING TO ISSUE.

THIS THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU -- REQUEST ON GOING FUNDING FOR TWO AND ONE HALF POSITIONS MAKING PERMANENT AN ATTORNEY. FOR AND ONE AND A HALF HEARING OFFICERS WHICH ARE JUDGES. THESE POSITIONS WERE ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED AS LIMITED TERM AND THEN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET. AIR TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE POSITIONS IN TE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT. IT WAS TAKING APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED DAIS TO HAVE A HEARING TO SCHEDULE A HEARING. WITH THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WHICH ONLY EQUATES TO A TOTAL OF THREE STAFF. WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THE INITIAL HEARING BEING SCHEDULED WITHIN SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS AND ENSURES THAT WE HAVE CONTINUITY IN OUR CASE LITIGATION SCHEDULING OF HEARINGS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ALLOWS THE PARTIES TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THEIR CASES. RECEIVE A DETERMINATION AND ANY REMEDIES TIMELY. AND EFFICIENTLY. AND IT ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. I LOOK FOR TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. OKAY WE HAVE THE LA -- GOOD AFTERNOON TEHAMA DEALER WE HAVE NO COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL OKAY -- WELL -- QUICK QUESTION -- THE THE THE ATTORNEY POSITION WHAT DOES THAT ATTORNEY ADVISE THE BOARD ADVISE APPLICANTS HOW TELL ME WITH THE ATTORNEY WOULD DO. SURE THE ATTORNEY FOR HAS MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS IN THIS ORGANIZATION HE IS AT THAT POSITION IS SHE HERE SHE IS -- THE POSITIONS AT THAT POSITION ADVISES THE BOARD ON GENERAL CASE STRATEGY IN LITIGATION THE POSITION ALSO OVERSEES THE THREE SENIOR BOARD COUNCILS WHO -- SO% HE'S LIKE THAT THAT THAT POSITION IT'S FILLED CURRENTLY WITH THAT THAT WITH THE GENTLEMAN -- THAT POSITION IT IS ALSO THE LEAD ATTORNEY TO ENSURE TRAINING AND EDUCATION OF THE SENIOR BOARD COUNCILS TO ENSURE. THAT THAT POSITION IS NOT AN ADVOCATE IT'S AN ADVISER TO THE IT'S AN ADVISER I SEE OKAY THE VISOR AND IT ALSO -- CONDUCTS OUR CASE LITIGATION IT HE HE THAT POSITION WILL GO BEFORE THE APPELLATE COURTS -- ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT AND IN DOES TESTIMONY. IN TRIES CASES. OKAY NOW I'M CONFUSED SO THAT THE ATTORNEY ADVISES THE BOARD AND THEN DEFENDS THE BOARD'S DECISION IS THAT. YES YES THAT IS CORRECT THE DEFENSE THE BOARD'S DECISION ALL UP TO INCLUDING THE SUPREME COURT THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME. OKAY YES IT WAS. QUITE A REDUCTION IN YOUR NUMBER OF DAYS WITH LIMITED PERSON OUT AND BACKUP COMPLEMENT YOU. BUT THE HUBBY ACHIEVED THAT WITH SUCH FEW RESOURCES. TWO HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED THAT RANGE. YOU'VE COME DOWN QUITE A WAYS THERE'S A MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT HAVE REDUCED DOES THE SCHEDULING OF THE HEARINGS ONE IS HAVING FULL STAFF OF THREE POSITIONS. THE OTHER THING IS IS WITH THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH AS PRE HEARING SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES AND CASE SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES WHICH ALLOWS THE HEARING TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN WE ACTUALLY CONDUCT THOSE HEARINGS. AND HOW MAY REGIONAL OFFICES YEAH. TWO THREE REGIONAL OFFICES WE HAVE TO REGIONAL OFFICES AND THREE SUBREGIONAL FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE OFFICES. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME -- ALONG THOSE LINES I I ALSO IT'S VERY NOTICEABLE AND COMPLEMENTARY FOR YOU TO REDUCE IT. OUT WITH THE WITH THE STAFF. IS THERE. WITH THE ADDITIONAL STAFF IS -- CAM THE OF WHERE YOU'RE AT NOW THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE REDUCED FURTHER WITH THE ADDITIONAL STUFF. NOW IT WILL NOT BE REDUCE FURTHER IN THE REASON FOR THAT IS THEIR SPECIFIC SPECIFIED TIME LINES THROUGH THE PROCESS WHERE -- THERE'S SPECIFIC FILINGS THAT HAVE TO OCCUR AND THERE'S A TIME LINE FOR THAT FILING -- SO THAT IS AT THE SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS IS. THE BEST CASE SCENARIO WITH ALL THOSE TIME LINES THAT ARE IN EFFECT ALREADY. SO YOU DON'T NEED MORE STAFF IN TO REDUCE IT. FROM THE SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS. TIME PERIOD I THINK THEN THE STAFFING OF THE THREE PER HAVING THREE PERMANENT STAFF WOULD ALLOW THAT THEY CAN. THE PROCESS TO GO AS IDENTIFIED IN THE ACT ALARY APPLIQUE YES HE COULDN'T DO IT ANY FASTER I DON'T BELIEVE SO THE WITH MORE STUFF I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND DOUBLE CHECK THAT -- BUT I BELIEVE WITH THE TIME LINES THAT ARE ESTABLISHED -- ON THE APPEALS AND THEN THEY HAVE A THE OF OPTION. TWO AT DO MOTIONS -- THAT THAT CLOSE IS THAT WE CAN GET IS THE SIXTY TO NINETY OKAY WELL I WANT TO AFFECT MY DECISION BUT IF IT IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO ME AND LET ME KNOW.

TRUMAN AROUSAL CENTER NIELSEN I'M BRIAN -- DEL WITH THE THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LEGISLATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY THAT KELLY CHARTS A PART OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD CLARIFY THE PROCESS FOR THE FAMILY. LEAVE PROGRAM THAT KALINJAR WILL LAUNCH JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. IT WILL PROVIDE UP TO SIX WEEKS. OF LEAVE FOR A CERTAIN EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. THE CURRENT ENHANCE INDUSTRIAL OR NON INDUSTRIAL DISABILITY INSURANCE. IS A WAGE CONTINUATION PROGRAM THAT IS PAID BY THE STATE. IT ONLY COVERS EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES THAT ARE DISABLED AND UNABLE. TO WORK DUE TO A NON WORK RELATED INJURY OR MEDICAL CONDITION. THIS IS AVAILABLE TO EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES THAT USE THE ANNUAL LEAVE PROGRAM. EXCLUDING PLEASE GENERALLY ARE THOSE ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY A UNION. BEGINNING JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR FAMILY CARE LEAD BENEFITS. WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ALLOW THESE X. EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. THAT ARE ON THE ENHANCE ND I TO ALSO TAKE. HEY TIME OFF TO CARE FOR SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER OR A BOND WITH THE CHILD. THIS NEW BENEFIT CAN BE CLAIMED FOR A MAXIMUM OF OF SIX WEEKS OR FORTY DAYS -- WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THE EMPLOYEE RECEIVES THE BENEFIT OF 50% OF THEIR SALARY AND THEY ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF AUGMENTING THAT WITH THEIR OWN. LEAVE TIME SO THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE A FULL SALARY. A PROPOSED LANGUAGE WILL PROVIDE CLARITY AND REDUCE CONFUSION FOR STATE ENTITIES WHEN ADMINISTERING THIS THIS NEW PROGRAM. FOR A AYE EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES SO THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. COMMENTS. HELLO. NO -- I'M SORRY COULD YOU EXPLAIN AGAIN THERE ARE CERTAIN. OF THE CERTAIN BARGAINING UNITS IN NON BARGAINING UNIT SOMEHOW. ONE PLAN SOME HAVE THE OTHER PLAN RIGHT YES THEY ARE YOU TRYING TO WHAT IS IT YOUR YOUR GOAL IS TO TRY. TO GET ANNUAL LEAVE.

OR SIBLING THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE UP TO SIX WEEKS AND THE STATE WOULD SUPPLEMENT -- THERE THERE'S WILL NOT DOCTOR SALLY BUT SUPPLEMENT THEIR LEAVE BY PAYING 50% OF THEIR SALARY. AND THEN THE EMPLOYER THEN IF THEY HAVE LEAVE HOURS ON THE BOOKS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFSET THE OTHER 50% IF IF THEY CHOOSE TO SO THAT DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME THEY WOULD RECEIVE A FULL SALARY. THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL SO -- SO THE A IN THE EYE RIGHT. THOSE BENEFITS ARE NOT. BEING EXPANDED FOR THE RANK AND FILE. BARGAINING UNITS THAT IS CORRECT AND I'M SORRY AND TRYING TO COURSES SO WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE INCLUDED [inaudible] THE THE ENHANCE ND I IS SPECIFICALLY FOR EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES -- THE RANK AND FILE -- THOSE OPTIONS OF WHAT TYPE OF LEAVE BENEFITS THEY WOULD HAVE AND DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ARE BARGAIN FOR AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. SO THIS IS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A UNION AND AREN'T BUT IT'S IT'S ENHANCING THERE'S WHAT DO YOU DO LEAVING IT UP TO BARGAINING. THAT THAT THAT IS CORRECT SO THAT'S HOUSE -- THE SEIU ONE THOUSAND BARGAINING UNITS HAVE ANOTHER OPTION THE SD I WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ENHANCE IN THE EYE. BUT THAT WAS BARGAINED AND NEGOTIATED [inaudible] OKAY. SAYS BUT SOMEHOW. THE THE RIGHT DEVELOPER THOSE BARGAINING UNITS ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET. THE SAME LEVEL. I THANK BENEFITS THIS WOULD ONLY APPLY TO THE EXCLUDED CORRECT. ANY CHANGE IN THE RANK AND FILE AGAIN WOULD BE NEGOTIATED THROUGH THE PARKING.

POINT -- WHICH IT'S A HARD THING TO DISCIPLINE AND IT'S AN EASY THING TO ABUSING THE CREW A LOT OF AN AND OBLIGATE. TO AT THE END OF THE TEN YEAR IN SERVICE OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE THIS BASS. TO CHECK COMING TO THEM SO LET'S LET'S TAKE A LOOK THAT IS WORTHY OF DISCUSSION [inaudible] COURSE. AND THEN YOU WOULD AT THE SAME TIME -- EXPLAINED WHAT THE ACTUAL POLICY. IS YES IN INCLUDING A POLICY NUMBERS BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING. COURSE WE HAD. OKAY -- WE'RE LEAVING THIS OPEN ANNA ANYMORE BUT PUBLIC COMMENT. NO. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOING [inaudible] TO ISSUE. NINE THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. HI GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON. I TOO MANY CALIFORNIA WORK FOR SILVERMAN BOARD I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THE ONE TO SPEND A COUPLE OF SECONDS TALKING ABOUT -- A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN WHAT IT AIMS TO DO -- AND THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S ROLE IN THAT. AB ELEVEN ELEVEN REMOVING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT IS A UNIQUE GANT PROGRAM FOR SERVING PEOPLE SIGNIFICANT -- EMPLOYMENT BARRIERS. THE BILL REQUIRES PARTNERSHIPS AMONG. LOCAL WORK FOR SOME OF AND CAN YOU BASS ORGANIZATIONS. ME INTENT IS THE CAN IS TO CONNECT SMALLER A MISSION DRIVEN CBO'S THEIR EXPERTISE. AND THEIR TARGET POPULATIONS MOST IMPORTANTLY. TO THE MAINSTREAM OF THE WORK FOR SYSTEM WHICH TENDS. TO OF IT'S A HARSH WORD BUT LOCK COMMITTEE BASS ORGANIZATIONS ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER ONES OUT OF ACCESS TO PUBLIC DOLLARS. SUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS FOR THESE DOLLARS WILL REQUIRE THAT APPLICANTS CLEARLY DESCRIBED THE ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CBO'S IN THE APPLICATION. OF THE BUDGET ALSO MUST REFLECT. HOW DOLLARS ARE GONNA BE ALLOCATED AMONG THE PARTNERS DOT SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR HOW MUCH THE CBO'S WILL BE ALLOCATED TO DO THE WORK -- THAT THEY PROPOSED TO DO. I THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US BECAUSE THEN WE CAN MAKE SURE -- THAT ARE MONITORING PROCESS IS ENSURING THAT THE CBO'S ARE GETTING THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES -- THAT THEY NEED TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO -- AB ELEVEN ELEVEN ADDRESSES AT LEAST TWO GAPS IN THE WORKFORCE SYSTEM IN THE TRADITIONAL WAR FOR SYSTEM. THE FIRST IS ADEQUATE FLEXIBLE RESOURCES FOR EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTS THINGS LIKE -- TRAUMA INFORMED CARE INCOME SUPPORTS -- LIKE STATEMENT FOR WORKERS THEY HAVE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS WHETHER GOING THROUGH EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. A CHILD CARE PRE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING -- THAT WE'VE DONE -- FOR YEARS WITH THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCILS LOCAL BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS -- I AND OTHER KINDS OF OF SERVICES THAT'S JUST TO NAME A FEW. THE REALITY IS THE MOST POOR PEOPLE WORK. I AND IN ORDER TO HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL -- TO PARTICIPATE IN A TRADITIONAL WORK FIRST PROGRAM -- YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO -- TO TO LEAVE YOUR CURRENT JOB TO SOME EXTENT. TO ATTEND CLASSES IT TOOK ME COLLEGE YOU OR THE KINDS OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S. WITHOUT THAT OF PEOPLE TEND TO GET LOCKED IN. DEAD END LOW WAGE JOBS AND OUR INTENT HERE IS TO HELP LIFT PEOPLE OUT TO A POINT WHERE THEY CAN ACCESS THE BROADER MORE TRADITIONAL WORK FOR SYSTEM -- AND GO TO CLASSES YOU COMMITTEE CALEDON GET QUALITY TRAINING WILL GO TO A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM THROUGH A PRE APPRENTICESHIP AND BECOME -- A MEMBER OF THE MIDDLE CLASS VERY SOON -- THE SECOND PART AND THIS IS WHY THE B. C. P.. I REQUEST IS SO IMPORTANT. IS THE ABILITY OF COMMITTEE BASS ORGANIZATIONS TO DRAW. SUCH A SHORT TERM BUT LONG TERM. US SUPPORT FROM THE MAINSTREAM WORK FOR SYSTEM BECAUSE SMALL MISSION DRIVEN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS FOR EXAMPLE. OUT REALLY STRUGGLE TO ACCESS DOLLARS TO COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND WORK FOR SPORTS -- SO JUST LIKE DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS NEED BROAD SUPPORT GENEROUS SUPPORTS. THE CBO'S THAT WE PLAN TO WORK WITH THAT THAT OUR INTENT THE INTENT OF THE OF A BILL OF ELEVEN ARE GONNA NEED THAT KIND OF HANDS ON SUPPORT FROM US FROM THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD. SO. THE CALIFORNIA -- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT JUST LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR OUR APPROACH TO GRANT MAKING THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS -- HAS DEVELOPED THE MODEL THAT WE THINK REALLY WORKS IT'S PRETTY UNORTHODOX. I THINK THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF GRANT MAKING ESPECIALLY FROM GOVERNMENT IS TO PUT MONEY OUT. I CALL IT UP PAY AND PRAY -- YOU PUT THE MONEY UP GRANTEES I DO THE WORK THEY SAID THEY WERE GONNA DO WHEN THEY REPORT TO YOU AT SOME POINT -- THAT THEY DID THE WORK THEY SAID THEY WERE GONNA DO AND THEY SPEND THE MONEY DOWN TO ZERO IT'S A SUCCESS. IN OUR MODEL WE DO A LOT OF HAND HOLDING SO WE ALLOW GRANTEES. TO MAKE MISTAKES -- ANALYZE ALONG THE WAY AND ASSESS THEIR THEIR PROGRESS IN THE PROGRAM TO MEETING THEIR OUTCOMES THAT THEY'VE SAID THEY WERE GONNA MEET -- WE ALLOW THEM TO KIND OF REASSESSING CHANGE COURSE IF NEED BE -- BUT IT'S THROUGH THIS REAL A CLOSE CONNECTION TO THE GRANTEES THAT WE PROVIDE THIS KIND OF HAND HOLDING THAT ALLOWS THAT -- THAT TO TAKE PLACE -- BUT OUT OF THIS PROCESS ALSO COMES A LOT OF INNOVATION A LOT OF INTERESTING SUCCESSES OF FOR THE CLIENTS THAT ARE TARGETED. THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE SEEN WITH THE KIND OF THAT PAY IN PRE MODEL -- WE ARE. OR ASKING FOR THIS REDIRECTION OF FUNDS FROM FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- UNDERSTANDING THE FIFTEEN MILLION IS NOT A LOT OF A LOT OF MONEY. I TO GET IT THE NEED. THAT CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA IS IN ITS COMPLEXITY AND IT'S AND IT'S AND ITS SIZE -- OUR INTENTION IS TO USE THOSE DOLLARS THOUGH SMALL -- TO CHANGE THE WAY. DOLLARS ATTHE LOCAL LEVEL LEVEL OUR EXPANDED -- FOR ESPECIALES POPULATIONS THE THE BROADER SYSTEM IS BETTER SIX BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT EVERY YEAR SO WERE TAKEN A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY WHAT KIND OF FROM THE MARGINS ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF A BIG WORK FOR SYSTEM. IN WAYS THAT PROVIDE PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED THE SERVICES BUT SEEM TO BE LOCKED OUT -- GET ACCESS TO SERVICES AND THEN THE BEST JOBS -- THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS NOT ADMINISTRATIVE WORK? WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS PROGRAM WORK -- AND THAT'S THE PART OF THE UNORTHODOX APPROACH TO THIS IS THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD STAFF -- IN ITS WORK. VERY CLOSELY WITH THE GRANTEES IN THIS KIND OF HAND HOLDING THAT INCLUDES COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE -- WHICH IS BRINGING GRANTEES TOGETHER UNDER THE SAME PROGRAM ON A REGULAR BASIS TO SHARE WITH EACH OTHER WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING WE'VE DONE THIS -- IN ALL OVER GRANT PROGRAMS AFTER OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AND SEEMS TO IT BUT DOESN'T SEEM TO REALLY WORKS WE'VE BEEN PUTTING VERY GOOD NUMBERS ON THE BOARD. US WE WANT TO CONTINUE THIS WORK. THAT WE FEEL THAT OF ELEVEN ELEVEN IN THE FUNDING OF THAT WAY THAT THAT GOES WITH IT WAS PUT AT THE STATE WORKFORCE-DEVELOPMENT BOARD BECAUSE OF THE MODEL WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO ESTABLISH OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS -- BUT WITHOUT THIS RESOURCE TO DO IT. WE CAN'T -- WE CAN ACHIEVE THE KINDS OF SUCCESSES WE HAVE WITH OUR PREVIOUS WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY [inaudible] COMMENTS. HI MARK JIMENEZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AS THE TITLE OF THE PROGRAM SUGGESTS THE AIM OF THE PROPOSED THE AIM OF THE PROGRAM IS TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT -- FOR SOME OF THE HEART. THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HARDEST HARDEST TO REACH JOB SOURCES PROVIDED IN THIS PROPOSAL -- WILL ALLOW THE BOARD TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ON THE AT THE THE GRANTEES -- AND IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS -- FOR UP TO SIXTY FUNDED PROJECTS IN THE BOARD OPERATES A PRETTY SMALL LEANING STAFF OF OF AND SO THE STAFF RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE QUALITY OUTCOMES. FOR THESE HARD TO SERVE -- POPULATIONS. LYNDA DOT SEMI. THANK YOU I'M HAS ALMOST THE ALEJO OUT WE HAVE NO SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL BUT AS AS STAFF INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA VERY CLEARLY. THE QUESTION BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS SORT OF HOW TO RECONCILE THE LEGISLATURE'S EXPECTATIONS ABOUT ADMIN AND PROGRAM COSTS AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT. WERE HELD LAST YEAR -- WHEN THE INITIAL FUNDING WAS PER ARE APPROVED AND AND WITH WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUT FORTH THIS YEAR ON THAT'S A QUESTION? FOR FOR YOU AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE LARGE TO INTERACT WITH THE THE BOARD ON OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS AND FOR THAT REASON WE CAN -- ABSOLUTELY WITH THE RECOMMENDATION THIS TIME TO HOLD THE ITEM OPEN. HOLD IT UP RIGHT. CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC I'M SORRY WITH THAT IN TERMS OF THAT THE PERCENTAGE TO THAT GOES TO ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THE ISSUE IT'S I DON'T WANT. TO DO. TO PUT WORDS IN MISTER RAINEY'S AND TESTIMONY -- I THINK WHEN THE PROPOSAL WAS INITIALLY RECEIVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND INCLUDING BY OUR OFFICE -- THE INITIAL REACTION WAS THAT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE WAS A A LARGER THAN. A TYPICAL -- SHARE THE PROPOSAL FOR FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ON THE BOARD AND MISTER RANEY HAVE HELPED OUR OFFICE AND STAFF UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THOSE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE WE'RE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AT FIRST. OUR MORE IN A SENSE PROGRAM COSTS -- SO WE'RE SORT OF INVOLVING IN AND CONTINUING TO TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSE WHAT THE TIME -- REGARDING SPECIFIC PERCENTAGES I BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL AT SOMETHING TO AROUND 22% -- FORCE WITH ADMIN AND PROGRAM COSTS THAT WOULD BE HIGHER THAN WE SEE IN A TRADITIONAL GRANTMAKING PROGRAM THAT'S OPERATED BY OTHER STATE ENTITIES. BUT AS MR RAINEY'S MENTIONED IT'S NOT. LEASES ARE UNDERSTANDING. NOT. INCLUSIVE OF ONLY ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS BUT ALSO SOME ADDITIONAL PROGRAM COSTS WORKING WITH CBO ISN'T. IN THE REGIONALS REPORTS. GOOD. OKAY. MADAM CHAIR DAN ROUNDS POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE BOARD. THE STAFFING -- THAT'S PROPOSED IN THIS BCP IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STAFFING REQUEST THAT WE NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE. WITH WHEN THE BILL WAS MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS DURING THE NORMAL APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS. THIS WAS FUNDED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY -- IN THAT THE PROGRAM WAS PUT ON PAPER AND THEN THE MONEY WAS ADDED IN THE FOLLOWING BUDGET YEAR SO THERE WAS NO LEGISLATIVE BCP INTRODUCED. BUT OUR STAFFING LEVELS REQUESTED IN THE B. C. P. ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ANALYSIS OF NEED FOR STAFFING THAT WAS PROVIDED TO APPROPRIATIONS THE YEAR BEFORE -- YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO GET THEM TO MAKE THIS. TOO LONG -- CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA OF ARE YOU LOOKING AND WHEN YOU SAY YOU WANT TO GET TO SORT OF OF THE GROUPS THAT. YOU KNOW MAY HAVE BEEN. EXCLUDED OR ARE NOT INCLUDED AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD. ARE YOU DOING THAT YOU. INDUSTRIES AND SO WHO WORKS IN THOSE INDUSTRIES ACTUAL HOW ARE YOU [inaudible] SORT OF YEAH EXCELLENT NINETEEN THAT. WE'RE WE'RE DOING BOTH WHERE WE'RE MAKING SURE WE'VE GOT A GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AS EQUITABLE ACROSS THE STATE SO ALL THE MONEY DOESN'T GO -- TO ONE PART OF THE STATE -- BUT IT SHOULD BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH POPULATION DENSITY IN NEED. IT'S A GREAT POINT ABOUT INDUSTRY CONNECTION. EXAMPLE IS THAT -- THE THE HOSPITAL HOSPITALITY TRAINING ACADEMY IN LOS ANGELES THAT I KNOW YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH -- H. TA. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH -- UNITE HERE ELEVEN IN THE HOTEL PROPERTIES DOWN TOWN FOR MANY YEARS TO TO DEVELOP THEIR CAPACITY AND HELP THEM. DO INNOVATIVE WORK THERE IN THAT SECTOR. ELEVEN ELEVEN AND OTHER WORK THAT WE'VE DONE. WILL FUND -- BRIDGES FROM -- DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS WITH REAL HEAVY SUPPORTS -- ON THAT FRONT END. TO GOOD JOBS IN IN HOSPITALITY FOR EXAMPLE SO THERE'S AN ALIGNMENT IN A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN. THE LABOR MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AND THE COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES ARE IN REMOVING VERY SIMPLE I MEAN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO WE'RE WORK WITH THIS. THIS FUNDING WERE INTENDING TO PLAY THAT OUT ACROSS THE STATE -- BECAUSE THE AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO CHIEF EQUITY -- BUT YOU CAN ACHIEVE EQUITY UNLESS YOU HAVE A CONNECTION DIRECTLY TO A REALLY GOOD JOB SOME PLUMBING SERVICES ALONG JUST ARE GOING TO CUT IT ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE HAVE LOTS OF BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. THAT'S RIGHT WELL THAT WAS ALWAYS MY EXPERIENCES THERE WAS A LOT OF SO CALLED THE TRAINING PROGRAM YEAH BUT THEN YOU'D BE LEFT OUT THERE. WITH NOTHING AFTER YOU WERE TRAINED -- AND THAT DIDN'T HELP EITHER RIGHT -- THERE HAD TO BE THIS WHICH IS WHAT REQIRED. EMPLOYERS TO BE INVOLVED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WAITING FOR THEM WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR AND I SEE TOO MANY TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE DISCONNECTED. FROM YOU KNOW A REAL -- A REAL SERIOUS EFFORT AT GETTING THEM INTO A JOB -- AND ALSO MEMBER HAVING HEARD FROM THE THE ACADEMY IS OUT REACH ONE OF THOSE OUT WHICH I THINK WAS TO THE TRANS COMMUNITY HERE. RIGHT -- TOO YOU KNOW. MAKE THEM FEEL A PART OF THAT THEY WERE WELCOME. ONE THAT THEY WERE TRAINED BUT THEY ALSO IT'S PART OF WEALTHY WELCOMING THEM INTO AN INDUSTRY THAT THEY OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE FELT -- THEY WOULDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET WORK. THAT THAT THAT'S MY OTHER -- BUMPER STICKER SENATOR IS -- NO MORE TRAINING PRAY -- TRAINING PRAISED PAYNE PLAY UP WHATEVER I DID [inaudible] BECAUSE GREATER. THE THE OLD APPROACHES YOU GIVE PEOPLE MINIMUM LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND THEN YOU SET HIM OFF INTO LABOR MARKETS IF IN FOR THEMSELVES AND IF THEY'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL. THEY JUST COME RIGHT BACK IN THE DOOR SEE WHAT YOU DO IS YOU CREATE THIS TURN -- COMING THIS LIST LOW WAGE LABOR MARKET TURN -- FOR PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED SERVICES TO GET PAST THAT OUT OF THE DEAD END JOBS -- THIS WAR APPROACH. AND WE BUILT THIS INDOOR HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP WORK ACROSS THE STATE IS TO FOCUS WAS ON THE EQUITY IN THE JAW AND THE QUALITY JOBS THE ACCESS TO QUALITY JOBS SO. WE'RE MOVING THE WORK FOR SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN. PRETTY -- CONNECTED TO THAT TRAINING PRE MODEL -- IN MOVING IT TOWARD THIS CONNECTION AS YOU DESCRIBED BRIDGES TO GOOD JOBS BY BRINGING EMPLOYERS. AND LABOR MANAGING PARTNERSHIPS IN ORGANIZED LABOR TO THE TABLE WITH COMMITTEE BASS ORGANIZATIONS TO TYPE PARTNERSHIPS -- IN THE WORK THAT WE DO THE STATE BOARD IS. A TINY HAND HOLDING TO DEVELOP THOSE PARTNERSHIPS AS INTERMEDIARY SAID THAT ACTUALLY MAKE THOSE BRIDGES POSSIBLE. SO WE DO A LOT OF WORK ON THE GROUND WE DON'T LEAVE IT UP TO OTHERS. THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING AND FUN CHAIR I JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT THEM IN MY EXPERIENCE WATCHING THIS FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS THIS THIS. CHANGE IF YOU WILL POSITION OR THEIR CURRENT POSITION -- I THINK IS NOW. OF GETTING THEM TO THE FUTURE AND GETTING MORE INDIVIDUALS WHERE THEY DON'T COME. RECYCLE BACK AND OR JUST BAILOUT THEY GET TIRED OF IT AND I THINK YOU MAKING SOME GOOD PROGRESS THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. NO MORE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK APPRECIATE IT. AND I THINK -- PUBLIC COMMENT STATE. IT'S NOT ON THIS ITEM IS ACTUALLY ON CAL STIRS PREVIOUS ITEMS IT DIDN'T HAVE. NUMBER CHANGE YOU WANT US TO WAIT UNTIL THE END NO THIS IS THE END OKAY. BUT BUT THERE'S NO MORE ON THIS PARTICULAR NO PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS PARTICULAR -- ITEM OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MUCH OKAY NOW WE CAN HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT CENTER JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WANTED TO ACTUALLY COMMENT ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REGARDING CAL STIRS CTA VERY MUCH SUPPORTS AND APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP -- TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM -- TO PULLED HELP TO PAY DOWN THE LONG TERM UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR CAL STIRS AS WELL AS TO HAVE A CREATIVE SOLUTION. FOR PROVIDING DISTRICTS SOME RATE RELIEF WE UNFORTUNATELY DON'T REALLY. AGREE WITH THE LA L.. ON ON THEIR ANALYSIS ON THIS ITEM AS FAR AS WAITING. TO PROVIDE DISTRICTS WITH THAT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FISCAL RELIEF NOW OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE GREAT RECESSION WE LOST OVER SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE NEVER GOT BACK AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY A LOT OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE. STRUGGLING PROVIDING THOSE RESOURCES NOW ARE GOING TO HAVE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THAT I SIGNIFICANT IMMEDIATE NEEDS ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE PARADISE UNIFIED PARADISES PAIN ABOUT TRIPLE WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN PAYING. FOR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING SO PROVIDING THIS KIND OF RELIEF COULD GIVE AN OPTION FOR PARADISE TO HAVE SOME RELIEF COULD ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR REALLY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IF THEY WANT TO HELP. TO COMPLEMENT THE A SIGNIFICANT FUNDS THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO USE TO PAY FOR SPECIAL ED WHICH IS NOT BEING ADEQUATELY FUNDED AT NIGHT THERE THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL. EVEN THOUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IS FULLY FUNDED IT IN NO WAY MEANS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE. ADEQUATE FUNDING AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL THIS PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THAT ITEM IN TRYING TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHILE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STRENGTH IN THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF CAL STIRS AS THE MAIN RETIREMENT OPTION. FOR OUR SCHOOL TEACHERS IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO PUT A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE TOGETHER AND I DO WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT BECAUSE SENATE FUNDED -- THE STATE ACTUALLY HAD AN OVER ONE DAY ARE OVER A DECADE PENSION HOLIDAY TO CAL STIRRERS -- IN DEBT SO YOU OFTEN HEARD ABOUT DIFFERENT FUNNY RATES FOR DIFFERENT PENSION SYSTEMS BUT WHEN IT CAME TO CAL STIRS THE STATE HAD A VERY GOOD DEAL. AND THE RATES FOR CAL STIRS WERE VERY STABLE FOR BOTH SCHOOL EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS OUR MEMBERS AS WELL AS OUR SCHOOL TEACHER IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEMBERS AS WELL SO. IT TOOK A SIGNIFICANT TIME TO PUT AB FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE TOGETHER AS CHRIS SALEM IN THE SEAT CHAU FOR CAL STIRS PUTS IT. YOU'RE NOT ON A SPEED BOAT THIS IS A CRUISE SHIP IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO TURN IT SO IT IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO FIND IT FULLY BUT THIS IS THE MAIN RETIREMENT INCOME SO ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO SIT SUPPORT TEACHERS. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU THANK YOU BROUGH KNOWLEDGE. ONE WAY BACK YES YES. A GOOD AFTERNOON KYLE HIGHLAND ON BEHALF OF THE CAL STARS FUNDING COALITION -- WHICH IS AN ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF I HAD THE SERGEANT PASS OUT ARE A SUPPORT LETTER FOR ISSUE NUMBER FOUR ON THE AGENDA WHICH IS THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR -- PROPOSAL BY THE GOVERNOR IT FOR THE TO INVESTOR BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE EMPLOYER SHARE THE CAL STIRS UNFUNDED LIABILITY -- WE BELIEVE IT'S A PRUDENT USE OF RESOURCES -- AS I MY COLLEAGUE FROM CTA ALSO MENTIONED -- IT'S A IT'S IT'S A HAS BROUGHT EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT ACROSS THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO SEE THAT THE THIS IS A PROPOSAL GETS INTO THE FINAL BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI I'M JODY DAY BERRY CHAIR FUNDING PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR CTA AND ALSO OF TEACHER UP IN SOUTH LAKE TAHOE TWENTY THREE YEAR VETERAN. I CONCUR WITH -- BOTH OF THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONIES -- AND I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE THAT MY LOCAL CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT BECAUSE OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. WE HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TEACHERS ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND TWO WAY IMMERSION PROGRAMS WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING SIGNIFICANT CUTS AGAIN.
