THEN THERE'S A HUNDRED AND

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:50.440
SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:52.208
THAT IS OUR- OF THE LEGISLATION

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:53.810
ALLOWS STATES TO KEEP UP 210%

00:56:53.877 --> 00:56:56.746
OF THIS FUNDING- SO THAT IT

00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:57.647
COULD BE USED FOR SOME STATE

00:56:57.714 --> 00:56:58.414
LEVEL ACTIVITIES IN THE

00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:00.150

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO I WOULD

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:24.207
POINT OUT HERE THAT THIS IS A

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:25.542
FINDING THAT THERE IS VIRTUALLY

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.544
NO GUIDANCE FROM- THE FEDERAL

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:29.879
FUNDING CAN BE SPENT SO AT THIS

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:32.248
POINT IT'S UNCLEAR. WHAT

GUIDANCE THAT THAT THE MONEY

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:41.724
COULD BE DISTRIBUTED DURING THE

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:45.161
FISCAL YEAR. WE GOT TO THE NEXT

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:48.097

IN FUTURE YEARS- THIS WILL

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:02.979
CREATE A MULTI YOUR OBLIGATION.

NINETY EIGHT- GUARANTEE. AND IT

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:12.388
WOULD BE- THE WAY THAT THOSE.

PROPERTY TAXES. IT'S ACTUALLY

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:50.193
30% RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD GO TO

FIRST THING THAT WE WOULD

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:04.641
EMPHASIZE THAT THINK- MISTER

CHAIR MENTIONED THIS A LITTLE

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:07.243
BIT IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS.

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:08.177
THAT THE PACKAGE DOES NOT

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:10.046
ADDRESS ANY A POSSIBILITY FOR

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:11.381
SCHOOL CLOSURES OR POTENTIAL

00:59:11.447 --> 00:59:14.250
DELAYS IN THE SCHOOL YEAR- WHEN

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:15.518
THE ACADEMIC YEAR OPENS AND WE

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:16.085
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:18.554
ISSUE. THAT THE LEADS THAT YOU

00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:20.156
WANT TO ADDRESS AND THAT

00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:21.925
HOPEFULLY END UP OF A BUDGET IN

00:59:21.991 --> 00:59:23.660
JUNE. WILL HAVE SOME GETTING TO

00:59:23.726 --> 00:59:25.194
SCHOOL DISTRICT ABOUT WITH WHAT

00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:28.765
IS TO OCCUR. WHEN THE- WHEN THE

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:29.599
OUTBREAK OCCURRED SCHOOL

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:31.567
STARTED TO CLOSE- THERE WAS AN

00:59:31.634 --> 00:59:33.069
EXECUTIVE ORDER AND LET

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:34.871
LEGISLATURE DID IT PASSED SB

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:36.773
ONE SEVENTEEN. WHICH ARE THERE

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:38.408
A NUMBER OF THINGS TO PROVIDE-

00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:40.343
FISCAL CERTAINTY FOR DISTRICTS.

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.378
IT ESSENTIALLY- HELD HARMLESS

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:44.447
DISTRICTS- AFTER THEIR

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.015
ATTENDANCE IN THIS YEAR BY

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.917
STOPPING ATTENDANCE COUNTING

00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:48.952
AFTER FEBRUARY TWENTY NINTH.

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:53.690
AND IT ALSO- ABOUT. SCHOOL

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:54.324
DISTRICTS TO OFFER A- IT'S YEAR

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.025
THAT WERE LEFT IN A NEEDED. AT

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.827
ANIMAL. RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT

00:59:57.894 --> 00:59:58.895
LAW IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HUNDRED

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:01.297
AND EIGHTY SCHOOL YEAR YOU ARE

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:01.864
SUBJECT TO PENALTIES AND YOU

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:03.433
LOSE SOME FUNDING. RIGHT NOW

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:04.634
THERE IS NO PROPOSAL TO EXTEND

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.235
THAT FLEXIBILITY. BUT ALSO

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:09.505
NOTHING THAT BAD- REPLACES THEM

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:11.207
WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. FOR

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.308
PROVIDING FOR THE CERTAINTY TO

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.077
DISTRICT BUT ALSO- BECAUSE WE

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:14.744
DO THINK THAT THERE'S AN

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.546
OPPORTUNITY HERE TO IF YOU'RE

01:00:16.612 --> 01:00:18.881
STARTING FROM- ACT MISSIONS FOR

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.116
WHAT FUNDING WOULD BE TWELFTH

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:21.384
OF THAT THE NEXT PETITIONS FOR

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.485
WHAT STUDENT LEARNING WOULD BE

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:23.619
IN THE EVENT OF CULTURES-

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:25.521
BECAUSE THINGS HAPPEN SO FAST-

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:27.523
IN MARCH WHEN WE MAKE THOSE

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.158
CULTURES THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:30.126
CLARITY. ON SOME SPECIFIC

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:32.895
AGENTS FOR OUR FOR SCHOOLS. NOW

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.630
MOVES TO OUR NEXT A THIRD OF A

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:35.398
COMMENTS RELATED TO THE

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.799
CONTINUITY PLANS WE THINK THAT

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.334
THIS. IS AN IS THERE A

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:39.602
DISCONTINUITY PLAN TO BE A GOOD

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.204
PLACE TO. SET SOME OF THOSE

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.306
CORRECT PETITIONS. I'M SO FOR

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:44.340
EXAMPLE THAT THE CONTINUITY

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:46.075
PLANS RIGHT NOW. SPECIFY HOW

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.477
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SPEND THE

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.545
FUNDING BUT WE WOULD- RECOMMEND

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:50.413
YOU ADDING SOME MORE SPECIFIC

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.614
REQUIREMENTS LIKE SUGGESTED

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.182
WHAT IS THE PLAN. IF SCHOOLS

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:55.418
WERE TO CLOSE- WHAT WOULD BE

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.619
THE PLAN FOR ENSURING THAT

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:57.653
THERE IS CONNECTIVITY FOR

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.923
STUDENTS AT HOME- HOW WOULD-

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.692
LEDS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:03.893
TO BEST SERVE FOR EXAMPLE. A

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.161
SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENT OR

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:07.030
OTHER STUDENTS WHO ARE. I'M I

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.531
NEED AND- A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.099
CHALLENGES AS WE- MOVE TO A

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:10.933
DISTANCE LEARNING DURING THIS

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.002
YEAR. A MEETING THAT THAT THIS

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:14.170
WOULD BE A PLACE TO SET THE

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:16.005
MODELS REQUIREMENTS. I'M THE

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.607
OTHER THING WE HAVE SOME TIME

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:19.242
FOR THE WAY THAT THAT FUNDING

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.443
IS DISTRIBUTED. PATHETICALLY

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.212
CONCENTRATION GRANT APPROACH-

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:26.249
SO ON THE WAY THAT IT WORKS-

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:27.016
CONSTRUCTION AND THRESHOLD IF

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:33.823
THE- FIVE. YEARS. POPULATION

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.658
BEING LOW INCOME OR- ORDER AND-

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.393
THAT THIS ARE. FUNDING IS THIS

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.761
IS IT'S A TO BE DISTRIBUTED. IN

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:39.829
YOU GET FIFTY SIX PER. IF 6%

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:40.663
YOUR STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.398
RESERVED INCOME. THEN AS OF.

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:43.866
YOU WOULD GET PER PEEP. FUNDING

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.468
AMOUNT. BECAUSE YOUR BONTA COME.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.804
THRESHOLD BUT IF YOU HAVE 53%

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.906
OF YOUR STUDENTS WHO ARE-

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.140
ENGLISHMEN AS OUR LOW INCOME

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.575
YOU WILL GET NOTHING. AND WE

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:53.776
THINK THAT CREATES TOO MUCH OF

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:56.646
A- SORT OF A SORT OF A- EITHER

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:58.748
OR EITHER YOU GET OUT. OF ARE A

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:00.483
LOT OF FUNDING OR YOU DON'T GET

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.318
ANYTHING AND WE THINK. OUR

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.152
APPROACH TO PROVIDE A MORE

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.854
SMOOTHER- FUNDING ACROSS

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:06.422
DISTRICTS BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.057
A DIFFERENCE IS THE NEED IS TO

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:10.026
DISTRIBUTE FUNDING BASED ON.

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:11.060
THE PERCENTAGE OF A DISTRICTS

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:15.465
POP- STATEWIDE CHAIR OF YELLOW

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:16.632
AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. I'M A

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:17.400
COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.368
WOULD- JUST MENTIONED ONE IS

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:20.536
THAT THERE YOU COULD PURSUE

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:23.039
ADDITIONAL- BUT TARGETED

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:25.108
REDUCTIONS ARM IN LIEU OF SOME

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:27.343
OF THE- LARGER OFF THE FIFTH

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:28.277
CUTS TO MITIGATE THOSE

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.779
REDUCTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THERE

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:30.913
ARE SOME ADAMS WITHIN THE HOUR

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.483
THE FACT THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED-

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:34.984
BASED ON HISTORICAL REASONS NOT

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.586
FOR ANY CLEAR POLICY PURPOSES

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:37.453
SUCH AS THE MINIMUM STEADY

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.890
PROVISION- THAT ARE IF YOU WERE

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:41.691
TO REDUCE THAT YOU. IF YOU

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:42.725
COULD ELIMINATE THAT AND SAY

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:45.061
NOT- HAVE AS BIG OF AN OFF THE

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:47.163
IF A PRODUCTION. I'M THE OTHER

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:48.598
THING THAT WE WITH A RECOMMEND

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:49.899
REJECTING THE PROPOSED

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.100
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PLAN. I

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.268
THINK WE DO HAVE CONCERNS

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:54.237
ABOUT- JUST LOCKING IN THE

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:56.439
STATES ARE. A SPENDING AT THIS

A PLAN B. BECAUSE ONE OF THE

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:25.701
CONCERNS I THINK THAT I HAVE

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.035
AND THAT I THINK PEOPLE

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.704
CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE IS THAT

01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:30.606
WE SURE WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:31.907
GO THROUGH THIS AND GET AS MUCH

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.909

ARE BUDGET BEGAN IN A FEW

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.048
MONTHS BUT IF WE WANT TO PUT

01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:40.983
FOR EXAMPLE A MEASURE ON THE

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:44.887
BALLOT A REVENUE MEASURE OR-

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:46.789
DEFICIT REDUCTION BOND LIKE WE

DID FIFTEEN YEARS AGO UNDER

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.359
SWARTS IN ANGER THAT DISCUSSION

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:51.827
HAS TO HAPPEN THE SAME TIME AND

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:52.895
THAT NEEDS TO BE THE SEPTEMBER

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:55.464

IN THE MAYOR VISION- THE WAY

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:09.945
THAT THE TRIGGER WORKS IS IT'S

STRUCTURED AS A REVERSE TRIGGER

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.582
SO THE FACT THAT YOU SEE IN THE

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:14.650
MIRROR VISION TO THE EXTENT

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:16.385
THAT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS

01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:18.854

THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE ONE

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:33.602
OF THE MAIN MAIN CUT- THAT WE

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:34.536
WOULD LIKELY FOCUS THOSE

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.405
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON TO THE

ABOUT FREE MARK IN THE

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:47.716
MECHANICS OF HOW THAT WOULD

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:49.051

THAT THAN THAT HAS. DISASTROUS

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:25.434
CONSEQUENCES ON KIDS IN SCHOOLS

TAKE A TIME OUT FOR THAT- NOW I

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:33.909
WANT TO GO TO. THE NOTION OF-

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.243
OF THAT THAT THAT THE FEDERAL

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:36.478
MONEY THAT WE'VE RECEIVED SO

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:39.147
FAR. IS PROMISING. HEARD FROM

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.582
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:42.217
THAT DISTANCE AWAY THAT WOULD

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:44.019
THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO DO MORE

YOU'RE A SCHOOL DISTRICT. HERE

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:22.958
IN SACRAMENTO ARE LA RIVER

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.826
CENTER BY WHAT HAVE YOU. TO

01:19:24.893 --> 01:19:26.928
KEEP HOLE THEY'RE CURRENTLY

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:28.830
DOING OR WILL THEY HAVE TO.

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.632
FOCUS ON LAYOFFS INCREASE CLASS

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:37.539
SIZE AND SO FORTH. THANK YOU I

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.241
COULD START AND TAKE THE

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:42.210
QUESTION I THINK THAT. THE ONE

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:44.779
OF THE KEY THINGS. YOUR MISTER

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:45.514
CHECK OF ONE OF THE KEY

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:46.681
QUESTIONS THIS SORT OF WHAT

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.716
SCHOOL LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:48.783
REOPENS AFTER A VERY IMPORTANT

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:50.952
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. I'M

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:51.920
LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:53.021
NUMBERS AS I MENTIONED I

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:54.456
DESCRIBE IN OUR PRESENTATION

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:55.490
THAT THE NUMBERS LOOK ROUGHLY

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:58.393
FLAT- SO IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.296
THERE WOULD. BE IMMEDIATE- NEED

01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:02.998
TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE HAVE. MAJOR

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:06.801
LAYOFFS AND THE FOUR POINT FOUR

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:08.136
BILLION DOLLARS THE TRAILER

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:08.937
BILL LANGUAGE FIFTY WITH ITS

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:10.772
ARE APPEARS TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:11.306
AND WILL PROVIDE DISTRICTS

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:13.074
OFFICE BILLION DECIDING HOW TO

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:15.610
USE THOSE FUNDS THAT CAN BE.

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:16.778
YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO- WE

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:20.782
THINK THAT THE RESULT. SCHOOLS

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:22.717
USE THOSE. AND THEY HAVE TO ME.

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:23.985
NOT NOT HAVE MAKE BIG BIGGER.

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:24.953
HOWEVER I THINK THAT QUESTION

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.021
IS SORT OF WHAT THE SCHOOL LOOK

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:26.922
LIKE AND WHAT ARE THE

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.823
EXPECTATIONS. DO DO WE HAVE DO

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.158
WE NEED TO HAVE MORE ADULTS

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:30.859
AROUND TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:33.461
ARE SAFE- IF THEY'RE GOING TO

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:34.696
NEED TO BE A GREATER USE OF

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:35.931
FACILITY THAT WE WANT TO HAVE

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:36.598
KIDS MORE SPREAD OUT THOSE

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:37.832
KINDS OF COST PRESSURES ARE.

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:39.668
ISSUES THAT. NEED TO BE

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:40.936
CONSIDERED IN TRYING TO THINK

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.671
ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD. WHETHER

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.372
THIS FUNDING AMOUNT WHAT WITH

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:46.741
THE IMPLICATION IS. OF THE

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:50.145
FUNDING. THE IS WHAT. THE KEEP.

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:52.647
THAT THE LET'S SEE WILL BE

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:53.181
THREE FIFTY. THE PARTY IS

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:54.449
HORRIBLE MUCH OF THE- THAT IS A

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:57.152
VERY UNCERTAIN CONVERSATION-

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:58.420
AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SURE.

01:20:58.486 --> 01:21:00.021
WHEN SCHOOL. SOME SCHOOLS WILL

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:02.958
WANT TO. OPEN UP PHYSICALLY.

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.693
AND SO I THINK. TIME TO FIGURE

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:05.560
THAT OUT COULD BE DIFFICULT BUT

01:21:05.627 --> 01:21:06.094
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:06.828
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS HAVE

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:09.698
CONTENT AND THINKING ABOUT- HOW

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:12.133
HOW. THIS THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.938
WOULD AFFECT SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:18.340
I'M JUST TO ADD TELL WHAT THEY

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:20.342
ALEJO'S STATED. WE DID TRY TO

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.177
CRAFT THE LANGUAGE I'M TO BE AS

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:23.745
FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE NOTING

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:25.247
THAT ONLY A FOR GONNA AND YOU

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:26.314
DON'T. QUITE A BIT OF

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:27.882
FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:30.118
THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING-

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.886
WITH REGARDS TO THAT THE-

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:34.089
PERIOD OF TIME- HAVE AND WHICH

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:35.590
ALWAYS CAN SPEND THAT'S FINE.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:38.426
I'M HOT SEEMS TO HAVE-

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:39.461
DIFFERENT GUIDANCE COMING OUT

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.162
FROM THE FEDS. AND WE WOULD

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:43.298
NOTE THAT YOU KNOW THE GARDEN

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:44.666
TO ITS STILL TRICKLING OUT AND

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.835
TO THE EXTENT- YOU KNOW THAT WE

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.670
RECEIVE- GUIDANCE AROUND

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:51.006
SPECIFIC USES OR AM. ANYTHING

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:51.940
AROUND YOU KNOW STATE LEVEL

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.408
ACTIVITIES WE WILL HAVE TO

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:54.342
REVIVED IN LINE WITH THAT KIND

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:56.811
OF. BUT OUT OF THE MAJOR

01:21:56.878 --> 01:21:58.079
REVISION BOTH THE LANGUAGE DOES

01:21:58.146 --> 01:22:00.115
REFLECT KIND OF WHERE WE ARE AM

THIS WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS AND

01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:34.849
IT KIND OF A REALITY CHECK FOR

THAT BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.986

AS PART OF THIS DIALOGUE- CAN

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:23.798
WE CONSIDER LARGER DEFERRALS.

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:25.200
TO MITIGATE AND REDUCE SOME OF

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.769
THE POTENTIAL TRIGGER CUTS AND

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:29.237
COULD THAT WORK WOULD THAT WORK

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:32.607
SO IF BOTH LA OWN DEPARTMENT OF

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.642
FINANCE COULD. ADDRESS THAT.

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:36.144
AND GO AHEAD AND START ON THAT

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:37.679
PIECE OF THE- DEFERRAL AMOUNT

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:39.247
THAT YOU SEE REFLECTED IN THE

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.949
MAJOR VISION. ARE WHAT THE

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.884
ADMINISTRATION CURRENTLY FEELS-

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.486
IT'S A REASONABLE BALANCE

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:46.421
BETWEEN CUTS AND DIFFERENT

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:48.056
RECOGNIZING THAT AT SOME POINT

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:49.424
THOSE DEFERRAL COST YOU HAVE TO

01:23:49.491 --> 01:23:52.927
BE. REPAID WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:54.896
AS WE GET MORE. INFORMATION

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:56.331
AROUND STATE REVENUES WE MAY

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:57.565
NEED TO GO BACK AND TAKE AND

01:23:57.632 --> 01:23:59.467
TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT THIS. BUT

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:01.236
AT THIS TIME THAT BALANCE THAT

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:04.939
STRUCK ME REVISION IS- WHAT WE

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:08.977
BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE. OKAY

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:10.845
AND THEN I KNOW IT'S NOT PART

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:12.347
OF EARLY EDUCATION PRESCHOOL

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:13.815
AND CHILDCARE BUT- AS FAR AS

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.450
THE CATEGORICAL CUTS. I JUST

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:17.051
WANNA NOTE THAT ONE OF THEM WAS

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:19.020
ACES AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AT

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:21.356
HIS DISPENSED WITH SENSUALLY.

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:22.323
I'M CHILD CARE FOR MANY WORKING

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:23.992
FAMILIES SO I'LL COME BACK TO

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:25.660
THAT IN THE NEXT PRESENTATION.

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:28.430
THE THANK YOU THAT'S IT FOR NOW

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:28.997
THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:33.768
GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:35.103
CHAIRMAN SO I'LL TRY TO GET THE

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:38.773
RIFLE THROUGH A FEW THINGS HERE

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.844
ONE. IN THIS TO BE FOR DO F. IT

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.579
LOOKS TO ME FROM REVIEWING THIS

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:45.780
THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.715
OVERALL ENERAL FUND REDUCTION

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:50.385
OF EIGHT POINT SIX PERCENT. IN

01:24:50.452 --> 01:24:53.888
THE MAY REVISE. YET IN THE PROP

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:54.756
NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:57.292
FUNDING IT IS FOURTEEN POINT

01:24:57.358 --> 01:25:00.028
THREE PERCENT. LESS SO IT

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:00.728
DOESN'T MATTER IT'S NOT

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:02.730
PROPORTIONAL TO WHAT WE'RE

01:25:02.797 --> 01:25:03.631
SEEING IN TERMS OF GENERAL FUND

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:05.400
MáS AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.302
WE COULD DO IN THIS IN THIS

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:09.704
YEAR RIGHT NOW. AND IS GOING TO

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.773
GET TO A COMMON THEME HERE. I

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.607
THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:15.043
THE RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY TO TRY

01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:16.077
AND KEEP IT AS STABLE AS

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:19.881
POSSIBLE- AND- SO WHY NOT RIGHT

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:21.449
SIZE THAT LOOKS LIKE EIGHT

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:23.284
POINT 6% REDUCTION IN GENERAL

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:25.553
FUND YET. WE'VE GOT A FOURTEEN

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:28.690
POINT 3% REDUCTION. IN PROP

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:29.858
NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUNDS IN

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:35.029
THE MAY REVISE. I HAVE- MY

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:36.231
COLLEAGUE COME UP TO SPEAK

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:46.174
ABOUT. HELLO AGAIN REASON IS

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:47.475
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:48.943
SO- AS YOU KNOW EDUCATION IS

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.245
FUNDED WITH THE PROPOSITION

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:51.579
NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEES SO THAT

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:54.249
IS REALLY JUSTICE- IT'S A

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.917
CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULA. SO THE

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:59.320
DECREASE IN REVENUES IS A 38%

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:00.755
WILL BE HAD AT WITH THE

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:02.156
GUARANTEE BECAUSE WE'RE IN A

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:04.592
TEST WHEN YOU ARE- THAT'S JUST

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.494
THAT TO THE EXTENT YOU WANT TO

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:07.428
GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:09.030
CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULA WOULD.

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:10.465
REQUIRE OVER APPROPRIATE

01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:11.866
GUARANTEE AND THAT MEANS CUTS

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:13.067
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUDGET

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:15.537
SO IT. IT'S A BALANCING ACT WAS

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:18.039
PRIORITIES I THINK WE DO THAT

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:20.141
IN THIS YEAR TO HELP KEEP

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:22.844
EDUCATE AND STAPLE. SO YEAH I

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.512
WOULD BE OPPOSE IN THAT. AND

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:26.781
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:30.785
DO A CORRECT. THAT IT YES YOU

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:31.819
COULD DO THAT YOU COULD

01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:33.988
APPROPRIATE. RIGHT AND THEN AND

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:35.490
THEN INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:36.791
DOING THIS OVER A THREE YEAR

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.226
AND MAKE A THREE YEAR FUNDING

01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:39.527
COMMITMENT WHEN WE HAVE NO IDEA

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.462
WHAT. THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.665
GOING TO BE. WE TRY RIGHT SIZE

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.199
OF THIS BECAUSE BECAUSE RIGHT

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:46.901
NOW YOU'RE PROPOSING TO DO A

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:49.504
THREE YEAR FUNDING COMMITMENT-

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:50.805
TO THE TUNE OF THIRTEEN BILLION

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:53.474
DOLLARS. AND WE REALLY HAVE NO

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:54.309
IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:55.877
YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN

01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:57.412
WITH ACTUAL REVENUE SO ARE YOU

01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:58.479
KNOW THAT ARE GOING TO BECOME

01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:00.081
AND WE'RE JUST. WORKING PROJECT

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:02.050
ENDS. AGAIN I SAY LET'S TRY TO

01:27:02.116 --> 01:27:06.754
FIND. MORE THIS YEAR. AND NOT

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:08.156
JUST TAKE THE TEST ONE BUT

01:27:08.222 --> 01:27:09.657
MAYBE FROM FROM MORE THIS YEAR

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:11.626
BECAUSE WE CAN DO THAT KEEP IT

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:13.861
CONSISTENT WITH. AN OVERALL

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:16.631
REDUCTION IN GENERAL FUND AND

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:19.167
NOT MAKE A COMMITMENT. YOU KNOW

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:20.835
TWO MORE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.737
IT'S GOING TO PUT US IN A PLACE

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:23.605
WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO MEET

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:25.340
THOSE OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAINLY

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:26.874
IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET HEARINGS.

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:28.242
WE CAN MAKE THOSE

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:32.447
DETERMINATIONS RIGHT. IT TO THE

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:33.615
EXTENT YOU OVER HER PRE THE

01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:34.782
GUARANTEE I I'M SURE I DON'T

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:35.984
HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS BUT IT

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:37.385
MEANS THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:38.353
THE BUDGET HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:39.621
SERVICES SOMEONE ELSE WILL NEED

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:41.623
TO TAKE. THAT CUT BECAUSE RIGHT

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:42.590
NOW THE BALLOT THE BUDGET IS

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:45.627
BALANCED WITH THE A PROP NINETY

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:46.628
EIGHT AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND-

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:48.196
WILL. OR SOME OTHER A WE WOULD

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:49.163
HAVE TO LOOK AT CUTTING THAT. I

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:50.999
UNDERSTAND THAT. DON'T KNOW

01:27:51.065 --> 01:27:51.866
THAT WOULD BE HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:53.267
SERVICES IT COULD BE. ANY

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:54.769
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT-

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:57.505
EDUCATION IS A BIG PRIORITY SO

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:58.973
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT ONE.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.743
BY MAKING SURE THAT IT SIZE-

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:04.312
THIS YEAR LET ME RUN THROUGH

01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:07.081
JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS.

01:28:07.148 --> 01:28:08.783
AGAIN I WOULDN'T CREATE THIS

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:10.051
MULTI YOUR OBLIGATION I THINK

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:10.785
YOUR POINT WHERE SAY IN

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:12.820
OURSELVES UP FOR TROUBLE THERE

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:14.489
WITH A THREE YEAR THIRTEEN

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:16.324
BILLION DOLLAR OBLIGATION.

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:19.861
LET'S DO IT RIGHT THIS YEAR. IN

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:21.095
THE LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.397
THE FOUR POINT FOUR THAT WERE

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:24.799
READ REALLOCATING USING FEDERAL

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:27.235
FUNDS. COULD THIS BE USED FOR

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:29.437
OTHER PURPOSES THERE'S A BIG

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:32.807
FOCUS HERE ON- LEARNING LAWSON

01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:34.609
AND ESPECIALLY ON GETTING. YOU

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:36.110
KNOW MORE DEVICES BUT AS MY

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:37.612
COLLEAGUES ON BEACH POINTED OUT

01:28:37.679 --> 01:28:39.180
OUR LAST YEAR IN THIS BECAUSE

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:40.415
YOU GIVE SOMEONE A DEVICE

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:41.249
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'VE

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:42.617
CONNECTED THEM DOESN'T MEAN

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:44.352
THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEARNING

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:47.221
AT HOME- AND AGAIN I THINK I'M

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:48.322
MORE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:50.191
THAT WE CAN. IS A VERY GOOD

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:51.559
CHANCE WE COULD REOPEN OUR

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:53.661
SCHOOLS IN THE FALL- THERE MAY

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:55.730
BE SOME DELAYS- BUT GETTING

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:57.365
KIDS BACK INTO SCHOOL GETTING

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:59.400
BACK INTO PROGRAMS. AND

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:02.403
MEANWHILE WE'RE CUTTING WE ARE

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:04.138
CUTTING. ATTACK AND WE'RE

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:06.074
CUTTING AFTER SCHOOL. WHICH I

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.408
THINK ARE TOO BIG PRIORITIES

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:10.278
THAT MAYBE IF WE RE SHIFTED

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:10.878
THESE MONIES AS WE'RE TALKING

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:13.247
ABOUT. MAYBE GOING A LITTLE BIT

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:15.850
MORE THIS YEAR ABOVE THE- TEST

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.286
ONE. MAYBE USING SOME OF THIS

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:21.422
FEDERAL MONEY. WE COULD MAKE

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:24.258
THOSE THINGS PRIORITIES AND NOT

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:25.993
JUST FOCUS IT ON PURCHASING

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.029
MORE DEVICES AND- BECAUSE ALSO

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:30.431
MY WORK WHAT THESE KIDS NEED IS

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:33.000
ACTUAL. YOU KNOW INSTRUCTION IN

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:34.969
SCHOOL THAT'S GOING TO DO MORE

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:37.739
THAN ANYTHING TO HELP REMEDY

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:41.843
THE LEARNING LOS RIGHT. EVER

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:44.645
OUTLANDER CAN WITH FINANCE- YOU

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:46.080
ARE RIGHT AND THAT THE REASON

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:47.548
WHY THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN AND

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:48.750
THE WAY THAT IT IS IT IS

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:51.719
PROBABLY NOT- THAT IF IT IF AND

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:53.454
ONLY EIGHT CHOSE TO. TAKE THESE

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:55.923
DOLLARS AND- THEY FELT THAT THE

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:57.725
BEST WAY TO- OFFER ADDITIONAL

01:29:57.792 --> 01:30:00.261
ENRICHMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:01.329
THEIR STUDENTS WAS TO DO IT FOR

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:02.997
AFTER SCHOOL OR THROUGH CTT

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:06.067
PROGRAMS. THEY COULD DO THAT

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:07.168
UNDER THE PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:08.970
WRITTEN OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:10.972
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:12.173
SPEND THOSE DOLLARS IN LINE

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.542
WITH A WITH FEDERAL LAW- BUT IT

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:17.078
IS IT IS QUITE BROAD AT THIS

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:18.045
POINT SO LONG AS THOSE

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:19.013
EXPENDITURES ARE RELATED

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.882
DIRECTLY TO MITIGATING THE

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.717
IMPACTS OF OCTOBER NINETEEN

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:24.285
SCHOOL CLOSURES. OKAY SO WITHIN

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:26.187
THAT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:27.755
THERE IS FLEXIBILITY TO USE

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:31.692
THAT IN OTHER WAYS. SO LONG AS

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:33.661

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:39.534
TYPE. YES I ALSO REALLY LIKE

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.769
THIS IDEA THAT THE LA- PROPOSES

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:42.770
OF MAYBE YOU CAN HELP TARGET

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:44.438
THAT INCOME TARGET THAT MONEY

01:30:44.505 --> 01:30:46.073
TOWARDS LOW INCOME IN ENGLISH

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:47.475
LANGUAGE LEARNERS RATHER THAN

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:49.677
JUST DOING AS A BLANKET GRANT

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:50.278

STRUCTURED BY THE

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:56.551
ADMINISTRATION I THINK IT'S

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.519
ACTUALLY- PROBABLY A LITTLE

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:00.688
MORE TARGETED- BUT IT'S

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:02.089
TARGETED SPECIFICALLY OP BOTH

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:03.457
L. USE THAT GENERATE

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:05.459
CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING-

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:06.928
FOR THE TWO POINT EIGHT. FIVE

01:31:06.994 --> 01:31:08.763
FIVE. MILLION OR BILLION DOLLAR

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:11.299
PIECE- SO IT IS VERY VERY MUCH

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:13.467
TARGETED ON THOSE- STUDENTS

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:14.602

INCOME. THE PIECE THAT'S NOT

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:22.210
QUITE AS TARGETED IS. ONE AND A

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:23.344
HALF BILLION THAT'S GOING OUT

01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:25.179
BASED ON SPECIAL EDUCATION AND

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:27.815
ROLL MY COUNTY. AND THE REASON

01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:29.250
FOR THAT IS WE DID RECOGNIZE

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:31.919
THAT ALL AND ALL. ALL UNITS ARE

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:33.988
GOING TO. EXPERIENCE SOME LEVEL

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:36.424
OF- LEARNING LOSS. AND WE FELT

01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:38.960
LIKE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:41.395
AND FUNDING TO GO OUT FOR.

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:43.965
EDUCATION BASED BUT FOR

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:46.467
PATIENTS. ONE OF POPULATION

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:49.637
THAT WE FOR HAVE. PART OF UNDER

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.672
SHIFTED AND FINE. BUT ALSO TO

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:53.841
PROVIDE ALL THE AIDS WITH WHAT.

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:55.643
TO SPEND. FUNDS BEYOND

01:31:55.710 --> 01:32:00.114
POPULATION. AND THAT'S A GOOD

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:01.048
SO FOR ME BECAUSE ON. A SO I

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:01.716
VERY MUCH OF. THE CAN COMMIT TO

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:06.587

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:08.289
I DO WANT TO DRESS THAT YOU ARE

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:10.291

AVERAGE ADA- FOR THE FUTURE.

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:16.063

ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE AT

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:26.040
WHICH IS MOST ELEAZAR. HOWEVER

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:26.807
THIS APPROACH COULD BE

01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:28.509
DETRIMENTAL TO ELEAZAR

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:30.878
EXPERIENCING GROWTH SO WOULD

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:32.313

THE THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:41.289

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.306
THINK THERE'S A ANOTHER LIKE

01:37:25.372 --> 01:37:27.241
COMPARTE POINT THAT I THINK WE

01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:27.775
HAVE FOR WHY WE- CONCERNS

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:29.410
BECAUSE AS WELL. EVEN WITHIN

01:37:29.476 --> 01:37:30.811
THE BUCKET A CONCENTRATION

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:33.681
GRANT DISTRICTS- THEIR THEIR

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:34.915
TREE AT ALL THE STATEMENT WE

WE'VE GOT TO THINK THAT THAT'S

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:38.719
CONCERNING SO- YOU KNOW THE

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:39.954
STATEWIDE A PRIVILEGE OF

CONCENTRATION GRANT START THAT

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:46.527
FIFTY FIVE IF YOU'RE DISTRICT

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:47.995
TO HAVE 55% OF YOUR STUDENTS

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:50.297
WHO ARE YELLOW INCOME FOSTER.

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:52.266
AND YOUR DISTRESS 90% COURT

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:53.934
YELLOW INCOME FOSTER UNDER THE

01:37:54.001 --> 01:37:55.169
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

PER STUDENT AND THOSE ARE VERY

01:37:58.105 --> 01:38:02.109
DIFFERENT SITUATION SO AND NOW

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:04.878
THOSE IN THOSE TWO EXAMPLES OF

01:38:04.945 --> 01:38:09.083
55% AND- PERCENT. THE DOLLAR.

01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:11.986
AND IN MANY WHO THAT. HE ARE.

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:13.254
FIFTY THEY GET NOTHING SO. WE

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.154
THINK THAT JUST IS NOT A VERY

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:16.056
KNOW WHAT THE- THAT WE THINK

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:16.924
DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDING. BASED

IT SEEMS OF THE PROPOSED AGE

01:47:55.101 --> 01:47:57.003
GAP ON CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD

01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:59.039
NOT ONLY DECIMATE PROGRAMS LIKE

01:47:59.105 --> 01:48:01.474
FIELD BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:03.743
LEAVES FEAR RESOURCES FOR ADULT

COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE. NOW

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:12.118
MORE THAN EVER AS WE SPEAK

01:48:12.185 --> 01:48:14.254
ABOUT HOW ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:15.856
IMMIGRANTS ARE TO OUR

01:48:15.922 --> 01:48:18.058
COMMUNITIES AND WORKFORCE WE

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:20.227
SHOULD NOT MAKE POLICY THE

01:48:20.293 --> 01:48:21.194
CHANGES AND LEAVES AND BE HIGH.

01:48:21.261 --> 01:48:24.531
TWO QUESTIONS. ADD TO THE

01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:27.167
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT IS

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:28.969
THE DEPARTMENT'S REASONING FOR

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:31.571
INSTITUTING AN H. CAP. FOR

01:48:31.638 --> 01:48:32.672
PUPILS ENROLLED IN A CHARTER

01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:37.410

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE

01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:41.281
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DOES

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:43.717
PLACE A CAP ON- ON CHARTER

01:48:43.783 --> 01:48:46.820
SCHOOLS- TO AT AT THE AGE OF

01:48:46.887 --> 01:48:48.955
UNDER TWENTY SEVEN SO THAT WILL

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:51.558
PEOPLE'S UP THROUGH THE AGE OF

01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:52.158
TWENTY SIX AND ALLOW THEM TO

01:48:52.225 --> 01:48:53.827
STILL BE FUNDED. THE REASON

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:55.362
THAT THE CAPITAL AND SET AT

01:48:55.428 --> 01:48:56.963
THIS LEVEL IF WE WERE TRYING TO

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:58.164
STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE

01:48:58.231 --> 01:48:59.132
CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE-

01:48:59.199 --> 01:49:02.102

OF TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE.

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:13.213
SO WE DID TRY TO STRIKE THAT

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.750
BALANCE- BUT REALLY THE CRUX OF

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:18.385
THE REASON WHY WE ARE PROPOSING

01:49:18.451 --> 01:49:19.886
PROPOSAL IS BECAUSE AT SOME

01:49:19.953 --> 01:49:21.888
POINT BUT BUILT EDUCATION

01:49:21.955 --> 01:49:23.223

OURSELVES TO SETBACK CAP UNDER

THAT REASON. THANK YOU. AND

HAPPENING AT EVERY DISTRICT I

01:54:09.642 --> 01:54:10.977
WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE

01:54:11.044 --> 01:54:12.045
DEPARTMENT ON WHAT SPECIFIC. IS

01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:13.479
THAT THEY'RE BEING THE LOCAL

01:54:13.546 --> 01:54:17.083
LEVEL- I HAVE NOT HEARD. IN

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:19.052
GENERAL AFRICAN CHALLENGES THAT

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:21.521
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HAVING

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:23.223
A IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF

01:54:23.289 --> 01:54:24.724
HAVING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:25.625
DEALING WITH SOME OF THE MEAL

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:27.827
PROGRAMS. THEN AGAIN I WOULD

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:31.864
SAY THAT THE- RIGHTS AT NEARLY

01:54:31.931 --> 01:54:32.432
SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY MILLION

01:54:32.498 --> 01:54:33.032
DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT

01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:33.833
WILL HOPEFULLY HELP SCHOOLS

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:35.868
ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:36.869
CHALLENGES IN WORLD THE- WE'RE

01:54:36.936 --> 01:54:38.871
HOPING THAT THAT FUNNY WILL

01:54:38.938 --> 01:54:40.006
ULTIMATELY BE AVAIL. TO HELP

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:41.507
SCHOOLS. AND COULD I YOUR

01:54:41.574 --> 01:54:42.442
PRIVATE OF EDUCATION ON THE

01:54:42.508 --> 01:54:56.623
LAST QUESTION. AND I DON'T KNOW

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:57.190
IF YOU'D LIKE TO REPEAT THE

01:54:57.257 --> 01:54:59.425
QUESTION. NO I AM WELL THINGS

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:00.994
AROUND YOUR QUESTIONS AT MEMBER

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.396
MEDINA IS OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:55:03.463 --> 01:55:06.032
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER FIVE

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:06.532
THOUSAND SITES THAT ARE

01:55:06.599 --> 01:55:08.735
OFFERING MEALS. AND ONE OF THE

01:55:08.801 --> 01:55:10.103
ISSUES THAT IS CAUSING A

01:55:10.169 --> 01:55:11.838
DEFICIT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS

01:55:11.904 --> 01:55:14.307
NOT BEING ABLE TO BE REIMBURSED

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:16.109
FOR THE COST OF THOSE MEALS

01:55:16.175 --> 01:55:17.410
SERVED. AND SO THEY ARE

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:19.078
UTILIZING ENORMOUS OF STAFF I'M

01:55:19.145 --> 01:55:23.082
SURE THIS DISBURSEMENT OF FOOD

01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:25.718
BUT THEY ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO

01:55:25.785 --> 01:55:26.753
BE. REIMBURSED FOR THIS COSTS

01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:29.389
THROUGH THE FEDERAL WE- AS-

01:55:29.455 --> 01:55:30.790
PURSUED MANY DIFFERENT FEDERAL

01:55:30.857 --> 01:55:32.525
WAIVERS TO MAKE IT MORE

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:33.860
FLEXIBLE FOR OUR DISTRICTS TO

01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:36.129
SERVE MEALS DURING THIS TIME SO

01:55:36.195 --> 01:55:38.197
THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL

01:55:38.264 --> 01:55:40.433
FOR OUR FAMILIES- BUT AGAIN

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.969
THAT DOES COME. AT A COST FOR

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:46.072
DISTRICTS. THE TRAINING FOR P.

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:48.841

WHETHER THE BEST APPROACH IS TO

01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:00.153
ENSURE THE SAFETY TRAIN. OUR

STAFF. AND FOR SCHOOL STAFF IT

01:56:01.321 --> 01:56:03.056
AND PART OF ONE OF THE RE

01:56:03.122 --> 01:56:05.491
OPENING TASK FORCE AT GOALS IS

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:07.260
TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S THAT

01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:09.862
HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR NOT ONLY

VERY HARD TO SWALLOW. EIGHT ARE

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:44.397
CHAIRED QUESTION ABOUT KNOW

WITH THE REASON. OF ENTER BEAN

01:56:58.177 --> 01:57:00.680
ASK TO DO SOMETHING. THAN WHAT

01:57:00.747 --> 01:57:01.881
WE'VE ASKED OTHERS TO DO

01:57:01.948 --> 01:57:03.916
COMMENT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:04.617
COMMENTED ON THE CHALLENGES

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:06.219
WITH TECHNOLOGY IT'S NOT JUST

01:57:06.285 --> 01:57:07.854

STUDENTS ARE ADDED THEIR SITE

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:16.963

RESULTS IN TERMS OF LEARNING SO

01:57:21.334 --> 01:57:21.901
I THINK THAT THERE'S REAL

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:24.804
CHALLENGES- AND I DO HOPE. WE

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:26.839
THINK ABOUT WHAT OUR PLAN. YOU

01:57:26.906 --> 01:57:28.641
KNOW B. OR C. I'M IF THE

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:30.343
FEDERAL SPENDING DOESN'T COME

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.911
THROUGH I KNOW THAT WHAT'S

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:33.479
PROPOSES JUST FLAT OUT CUTS BUT

01:57:33.546 --> 01:57:37.016
WERE ASKING FOR ANOTHER PLAN-

01:57:37.083 --> 01:57:38.651
IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL

01:57:38.718 --> 01:57:40.019
FUNDING AND JUST. GOT OUT CUTS-

01:57:40.086 --> 01:57:41.687
STATING THAT THE US THAT YOU

01:57:41.754 --> 01:57:45.925
PUNISH SAY OVERALL. RELATION TO

01:57:45.992 --> 01:57:50.329
BUDGET- AND- WE SEE A LITTLE

01:57:50.396 --> 01:57:54.167
BIT MORE. I HAVE A CUP. IS IT

01:57:54.233 --> 01:57:56.335
AFTER SCHOOL. SPECIAL MEALS ALL

01:57:56.402 --> 01:57:57.403
THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHAR

01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:58.471
EIGHT AT JUST PREPARING YOU A

01:57:58.538 --> 01:58:00.573
TO SEE WHO'S GONNA. COME UP AND

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.275
ANSWER QUESTIONS I ON THE

01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:04.043
SPECIAL AND FRIENDS. YOU KNOW

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:05.645
WE'VE HEARD AT LEAST I'VE HEARD

01:58:05.711 --> 01:58:08.314
FROM SOME FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT-

01:58:08.381 --> 01:58:09.749
WHO APPRECIATE THAT

01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:11.551
ADMINISTRATION INCREASE IN

01:58:11.617 --> 01:58:13.786
SPECIAL EDUCATION RATES- BUT I

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:16.622
AM CURIOUS ON WHY THE FORMULA

01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:18.891
THAT IMPACT- I'VE HEARD FROM MY

01:58:18.958 --> 01:58:21.060
DISTRICT AT THE- THEY- ARE THE

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:23.930
AB SIX OH TWO FOR. THE FORMULA.

01:58:23.996 --> 01:58:27.667
WHAT MIGHT ITS FORMULA. I WE

01:58:27.733 --> 01:58:28.935
HAD A LOT OF IS THE- IN THE

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:30.403
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT THE NEW

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:32.038
FORMALLY AS VERY VERY SOMEONE'S

01:58:32.104 --> 01:58:34.273
BABY SIX OH TWO. WHAT IT DOES

01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:34.907
THOUGH IT STARTS THE LANGUAGE

01:58:34.974 --> 01:58:38.377
NEW THERE'S A LOT OF- CONFUSING

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:39.946
SEGMENTS IN THE SIX OH TWO

01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:41.848
FORMULA THERE'S A LOT OF OUT ON

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:44.116
CATEGORICAL THAT ARE FROZEN IN

01:58:44.183 --> 01:58:50.256
TIME THAT MAKE KNOWS AND- SO

01:58:50.323 --> 01:58:50.823
THIS WOULD JUST BE STARTING

01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:51.390
WITH THE BAY. WE HAVE WORKED

01:58:51.457 --> 01:58:52.825
THE STUDIES WAS. DIFFERENT

01:58:52.892 --> 01:58:55.328
THESE THEN. NOW AS WE MOVE OUT

01:58:55.394 --> 01:58:56.929
WHICH WOULD ADD THE EQUITY P.

01:58:56.996 --> 01:58:59.665
WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE PROGRAM

01:58:59.732 --> 01:59:00.867
SO YOU SAID IT'S SIMILAR BUT

01:59:00.933 --> 01:59:02.602
NOT IDENTICAL SO WHAT ARE THE

01:59:02.668 --> 01:59:04.070
THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT. THE

01:59:04.136 --> 01:59:05.238
BIGGEST DIFFERENCE THREE A

01:59:05.304 --> 01:59:06.672
ROLLING AVERAGE FOR THE EIGHTY

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.407
A RIGHT NOW- SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:59:08.474 --> 01:59:09.775
FORMULA IS KIND OF THE GREATER

01:59:09.842 --> 01:59:11.978
OF. PRIOR IN PRIOR YEAR- SO

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:13.579
THEY THEY KIND OF GOT A THREE

01:59:13.646 --> 01:59:15.715
YEAR. OLD ARE TEAR HOLD

01:59:15.781 --> 01:59:17.517
HARMLESS BUT I'M NOT. YOU KNOW

01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:19.018
SOME OF THE FACT THAT WITH.

01:59:19.085 --> 01:59:21.587
FEARFUL TARA AND THEN THAT THAT

01:59:21.654 --> 01:59:23.422
IS MOSTLY THE BASE FORMULA-

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:24.991
ISSUES I'M TRYING TO THINK I'M

01:59:25.057 --> 01:59:27.326
SORRY I DID NOT BRING. BACK UP

01:59:27.393 --> 01:59:29.829
ON THAT BUT- THE DEPARTMENT

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:31.030
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING HERE THAT

01:59:31.097 --> 01:59:32.031
COULD SPEAK TO A LITTLE BETTER

01:59:32.098 --> 01:59:34.000
THAN I BUT- THAT THAT IS THE

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:36.569
BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE ATA. OKAY

01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:39.305
I'M ARE A IN THE IN I THINK AT

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:41.574
THIS POINT THE- AGAIN YOU'VE

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:42.608
HEARD SOME OF THIS FROM MY

01:59:42.675 --> 01:59:43.910
COLLEAGUES BUT FLEXIBILITY IS

01:59:43.976 --> 01:59:46.512
REALLY IMPORTANT- AND SO I'M

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:48.347
TRYING TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT

01:59:48.414 --> 01:59:49.782
IN THESE REALLY TOUGH TIMES.

01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:52.285
SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT IS NOT

01:59:52.351 --> 01:59:54.086
IDENTICAL LIKE IS THAT WHERE.

01:59:54.153 --> 01:59:55.187
I'M TRYING TO MAKE THINGS

01:59:55.254 --> 01:59:56.422
EASIER FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:59:56.489 --> 01:59:58.324
THIS IS REALLY REALLY HARD SO

01:59:58.391 --> 01:59:59.892
IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THIS WHERE

01:59:59.959 --> 02:00:02.028
I'M LIKE IT MIGHT BE THE BEST.

02:00:02.094 --> 02:00:03.029
YOU KNOW FOR WHAT WHERE AND

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:05.865
THERE BUT IF THE- DAYS. BUT NOT

02:00:05.932 --> 02:00:07.967
IDENTICAL FORMULA IS EASIER FOR

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:09.235
SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'D LIKE FOR

02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:11.304
US TO CONSIDER. PUTTING MORE

02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:13.973
AND DIFFERENT ON THEM IN A TIME

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:17.910
WHERE. WE NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:19.378
I THINK IT. SOMETHING NEED TO

02:00:19.445 --> 02:00:20.846
LOOK AT INCOMES. I'M THE OTHER

02:00:20.913 --> 02:00:23.482
IS THAT. THAT I HAD RELATED TO

02:00:23.549 --> 02:00:25.084
AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND

02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:26.285
AGAIN SOME OF THIS IS BEEN

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:27.787
SAID. THAT YOU KNOW AFTER

02:00:27.853 --> 02:00:29.889
SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE A FORM OF

02:00:29.956 --> 02:00:31.524
CHILD CARE FOR SOME OF OUR-

02:00:31.591 --> 02:00:33.826
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND

02:00:33.893 --> 02:00:36.095
UP. IF OUR STUDENTS AREN'T

02:00:36.162 --> 02:00:37.863
GOING TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS

02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:43.803
WHERE ARE THEY GOING. AS FAR AS

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:45.071
THAT A QUESTION FOR ME THAT IS

02:00:45.137 --> 02:00:45.938
A QUOTE I MEAN THAT'S A

02:00:46.005 --> 02:00:46.672
QUESTION FOR WHO EVER LET

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:49.208
ANSWER IT SORRY AND I. TURNED

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:49.809
AROUND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:51.277
SEE NO THAT'S OKAY I CAN EITHER

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:56.248
I'M RIGHT IN FRONT. WITH IT'S-

02:00:56.315 --> 02:00:57.283
VERY ODD DURING YOUR FACE YOU

02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:59.552
TO. AS WELL SO I. THE EIGHTH IS

02:00:59.619 --> 02:01:01.687
TO WHAT THE SLOTS FOR ACES WERE

02:01:01.754 --> 02:01:03.422
NOT CUT. IT WAS THE OUT ON A

02:01:03.489 --> 02:01:04.523
RATE. THAT WERE WOULD BE

02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:05.524
ADDITIONAL ADD ON HUNDRED

02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:06.959
MILLION THAT WENT TO THE RATE.

02:01:07.026 --> 02:01:08.361
SO THE RATE WOULD JUST REVERT

02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:09.895
BACK TO THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:13.199
RATE- SO THIS DID NOT ACTUALLY

02:01:13.265 --> 02:01:14.500
CUT ACCESS. AND IF I MIGHT ADD

COMPLETELY ELIMINATED DOES IT

02:03:17.490 --> 02:03:18.824
MAKE SENSE FOR OUR STATE TO

SCHOOLS I MEAN BECAUSE I DO

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:10.242
THINK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

AS MUCH AS WE CAN- AND THERE

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:14.246
COULD BE A PARTNERSHIP THERE-

02:04:14.313 --> 02:04:15.981

02:05:12.471 --> 02:05:14.240
SECOND GRADER TO AVOID I'M

02:05:14.306 --> 02:05:16.442
HAVING TO DO THAT THE STATE

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:18.043

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:30.088
IT IS PERMISSIVE YOU KNOW AND

02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:31.356
FEDERAL I HOPE- ITALY'S

02:15:31.423 --> 02:15:33.425
CONTEMPLATE THAT BECAUSE AGAIN

02:15:33.492 --> 02:15:35.193
SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT ALL

02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:38.396
ARE FEEDING THE ENTIRE. ARE

02:15:38.463 --> 02:15:41.333
WITH THAT- ON ON THE SPECIAL ED

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:43.401
FUNDING- I HOPE WE CAN LOOK

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:45.070
TOWARDS CREATING WITH WITH BUT

02:15:45.136 --> 02:15:46.605
THE GOVERNOR'S MONEY THAT IS

02:15:46.671 --> 02:15:48.607
ALLOCATED FOR THE SPECIAL ED-

02:15:48.673 --> 02:15:49.741
THAT WE COULD. POSSIBLY LOOK

02:15:49.808 --> 02:15:51.643
CREATING AWAITED FORMULA FOR

02:15:51.710 --> 02:15:53.778
THOSE DISTRICTS THAT SERVE MORE

02:15:53.845 --> 02:15:54.779
SPECIAL ED STUDENTS AND OTHER

02:15:54.846 --> 02:15:56.915
SOME DISTRICTS. HAVE A LOT OF

02:15:56.982 --> 02:15:58.416
SPECIAL STUDENTS WITH OTHERS

02:15:58.483 --> 02:16:00.619
SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T. THERE'S

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:02.320
PAST PRACTICE OF DOING IT WE DO

02:16:02.387 --> 02:16:03.955
IT WITH THE CONCENTRATION. THE

02:16:04.022 --> 02:16:05.690
SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION

02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:07.259
CLINT GRANTS WE DO WE DO IT FOR

02:16:07.325 --> 02:16:09.528
THEM. AND IN SOME DISTRICTS IN

02:16:09.594 --> 02:16:11.162
PARTICULAR. WHAT WE HAVE IS

02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:12.564
CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE COME AND

02:16:12.631 --> 02:16:14.132
THEY'RE SERVING STUDENTS ARE

02:16:14.199 --> 02:16:16.501
NOT. SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN.

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.169
AND THAT'S A THAT THAT THAT.

02:16:18.236 --> 02:16:19.771
THAT HAVE CREATE SOME A PRETTY

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:22.007
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN ON

02:16:22.073 --> 02:16:23.575
THE DISTRICT THAT THEN DOES

02:16:23.642 --> 02:16:25.243
SERVE THE SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD

02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:26.678
SO THAT THAT SHOULD BE A POINT

02:16:26.745 --> 02:16:28.013
OF CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD.

02:16:28.079 --> 02:16:29.447
SOME OTHER THINGS AS WHAT WE

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:32.183
MIGHT WANT TO CONTEMPLATE IS-

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:33.952
REDUCE THE ROUTINE RESTRICTED

02:16:34.019 --> 02:16:37.422
THAT'S ACCOUNT. I DELAYED-

02:16:37.489 --> 02:16:39.057
DELAY INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL

02:16:39.124 --> 02:16:41.960
ADOPTIONS TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

02:16:42.027 --> 02:16:43.128
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME CLASS SIZE

02:16:43.194 --> 02:16:45.063
PENALTIES TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE

02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:47.399
THE LCF UPGRADE SPAN ADJUSTMENT

02:16:47.465 --> 02:16:48.633
WE MAKE WE MIGHT WANT ALLOW FOR

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:49.801
MORE FLEXIBILITY THERE SURPLUS

02:16:49.868 --> 02:16:51.102
PROPERTY I BELIEVE THAT'S IN

02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:52.671
THE TRAILER BILL RIGHT NOW AS I

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:55.140
UNDERSTAND IT. POTENTIALLY LOOK

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:58.910
AT SOME PEPPERONI. SUSPENSION

02:16:58.977 --> 02:17:00.579
OF THAT SO THE TEACHERS CAN

02:17:00.645 --> 02:17:03.181
RETIRE MAKE YOUR- SOME PROGRAM

02:17:03.248 --> 02:17:05.317
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AS WELL OF

02:17:05.383 --> 02:17:07.152
SUSPEND MANDATES THE START TIME

02:17:07.218 --> 02:17:08.653
BILL RIGHT PROBABLY THE WORST

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:11.790
BILL OF MY TENURE HERE- FORCING

02:17:11.856 --> 02:17:13.525
SCHOOLS TO STARTED A CERTAIN

02:17:13.592 --> 02:17:15.026
TIMES CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE I'M

02:17:15.093 --> 02:17:16.227
HEARING FROM DISTRICTS ACROSS

02:17:16.294 --> 02:17:17.395
THE STATE ABOUT THAT. IT'S

02:17:17.462 --> 02:17:19.464
GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:22.300
IMPLEMENT THAT- INSTRUCTIONAL

02:17:22.367 --> 02:17:23.368
DAYS WE HEARD THAT WE NEED SOME

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:25.103
FLEXIBILITY SO THE DISTRICTS

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:25.804
CAN GO HYBRID WE DON'T KNOW

02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:27.906
WHAT. NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:28.473
LOOK LIKE AND I THINK IT'S

02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:30.075
GOING TO LOOK LIKE IT'S GONNA

02:17:30.141 --> 02:17:31.309
LOOK VERY DIFFERENT IN

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:33.545
DIFFERENT DISTRICTS- SOME

02:17:33.612 --> 02:17:34.579
DISTRICTS ARE PROBABLY GONNA

02:17:34.646 --> 02:17:35.480
HAVE A HYBRID WHERE THEY MIGHT

02:17:35.547 --> 02:17:37.082
GO MONDAY WEDNESDAY FRIDAY ONE

02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:39.384
WEEK TUESDAY THURSDAY THEM ACT

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:40.018
EXTEND THE OTHER KIDS FEEL ON

02:17:40.085 --> 02:17:41.920
THE OTHER DAYS. SO WE NEED TO

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:42.821
MAKE SURE THAT DISTRICTS HAVE

02:17:42.887 --> 02:17:46.992
THE- THE ABILITY TO- TO- TO GO

02:17:47.058 --> 02:17:48.460
HYBRID IF THEY NEED TO FOR

02:17:48.526 --> 02:17:51.162
SAFETY REASONSALONG- WITH THAT

02:17:51.229 --> 02:17:55.233

THINK WE WERE JUST A HIGHLIGHT

02:22:48.393 --> 02:22:50.361
HERE AGAIN. THAT THE PROPOSAL

02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:51.863

02:23:00.171 --> 02:23:02.674
AND WHAT PROVIDERS WORK TO DO

02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:04.242
IF WE DON'T END UP BAKER GOING

02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:07.979
BACK TO NORMAL. I'M JUST- AS A

02:23:08.046 --> 02:23:10.248
REFRESHER WHEN THE STATE DID-

02:23:10.315 --> 02:23:11.215
CREATED EMERGENCY THERE'S A

02:23:11.282 --> 02:23:13.384
VARIETY OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND

02:23:13.451 --> 02:23:15.453
MANAGEMENT BOLTON'S. THAT ON

02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:16.421
CERTAIN SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

02:23:16.487 --> 02:23:18.756
FOR- CHALKER PROVIDERS ONE OF

02:23:18.823 --> 02:23:20.658
THEM IS TO LIMIT GROUP SIZES

02:23:20.725 --> 02:23:22.560
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT- ARE AT

02:23:22.627 --> 02:23:23.728
OR NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE

02:23:23.795 --> 02:23:24.696
CLASSROOM SIZES WHICH SOMETHING

02:23:24.762 --> 02:23:25.830
THAT. HAVE BEEN YOU NEED NO

02:23:25.897 --> 02:23:27.198
MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU CAN HAVE

02:23:27.265 --> 02:23:27.732
MORE THAN A THIRD NUMBER

02:23:27.799 --> 02:23:32.070
pMORE ADULTS PER STUDENT TO

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:34.205
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN

02:23:34.272 --> 02:23:35.573
ANY PARTICULAR. AREA OF THESE

02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:38.076
ARE ACTIONS THAT WERE NECESSARY

02:23:38.142 --> 02:23:39.610
TO DEAL WITH- THE COVER

02:23:39.677 --> 02:23:40.311
NINETEEN OUTBREAK BUT THE DO

02:23:40.378 --> 02:23:47.418
PLACE A LOT. ON. SO NOT ARE

02:23:47.485 --> 02:23:49.220
HAVING THE KITCHEN BUT WHAT.

02:23:49.287 --> 02:23:50.188
WITH THE CIVIC BEFORE IMPORTANT

02:23:50.254 --> 02:23:52.724
FRIEND OR- BAREFOOT SITUATE.

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:53.992
I'M WE WOULD SAY ON THE ON THE-

02:23:54.058 --> 02:23:55.360
TO REDUCE OUR VOUCHERS 10%

02:23:55.426 --> 02:23:56.194
ACROSS BOARD AT THE WE WOULD

02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:58.663
JUST NOTE THIS WOULD DOES NOT-

02:23:58.730 --> 02:23:59.697
DOES NOT ALIGNED WITH THE

02:23:59.764 --> 02:24:01.065
REGIONAL MARKET RATE. THAT'S

02:24:01.132 --> 02:24:03.334
THE WAY THAT THESE- RATES ARE

02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:05.303
STEP ACROSS THE STATE- BY DOING

02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:07.638
ACROSS THE BORDER ACTION AS

02:24:07.705 --> 02:24:08.172
OPPOSED TO SAY MOVING TO A

02:24:08.239 --> 02:24:08.706
DIFFERENT PERCENT ON THE

02:24:08.773 --> 02:24:09.907
REGIONAL MARKET RATE MEANS THAT

02:24:09.974 --> 02:24:11.943
FAMILIES WILL HAVE DIFFERENT

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:12.877
LEVELS OF ACCESS TO THEIR

02:24:12.944 --> 02:24:14.245
PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE SO.

02:24:14.312 --> 02:24:15.546
IN SOME CASES THAT 10%

02:24:15.613 --> 02:24:17.715
REDUCTION MADE STILL MEAN THAT

02:24:17.782 --> 02:24:18.516
THERE'S A LOT OF PROVIDERS THAT

02:24:18.583 --> 02:24:19.517
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE

02:24:19.584 --> 02:24:20.985
VOUCHER FOR IN OTHER CASES THAT

02:24:21.052 --> 02:24:22.687
MIGHT BE SEVERELY LIMITED AND

02:24:22.754 --> 02:24:23.521
SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE

02:24:23.588 --> 02:24:25.790
REDUCTION BE MADE. BY TAKING IT

02:24:25.857 --> 02:24:27.592
TO A TO THE LOWER PERCENTILE IN

02:24:27.658 --> 02:24:31.629
SERVICE. I'M IN IN TERMS OF-

02:24:31.696 --> 02:24:33.031
BUT WE HAVE A FEW OTHER THINGS

02:24:33.097 --> 02:24:34.065
TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF

02:24:34.132 --> 02:24:35.933
MINIMIZING RATE REDUCTIONS. WE

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.468
WERE NOT THAT THERE ARE FIFTY

02:24:37.535 --> 02:24:38.836
MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP SIXTY

02:24:38.903 --> 02:24:39.670
FOUR FUNDS THAT ARE SCHEDULED

02:24:39.737 --> 02:24:41.572
TO. OUR GO OUT IN THE BUDGET

02:24:41.639 --> 02:24:42.573
YEAR THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:44.208
FOR NEW GENERAL TUCKER SLOTS.

02:24:44.275 --> 02:24:45.843
ARE BOTH THAT FUNDING COULD

02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:46.978
POTENTIALLY BE REPURPOSE TO BE

02:24:47.045 --> 02:24:50.048
USED TO MITIGATE THE- NINETY

02:24:50.114 --> 02:24:51.416
RATE. RATE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE

02:24:51.482 --> 02:24:52.950
HAPPENING- AND ALTHOUGH WE

02:24:53.017 --> 02:24:53.684
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WOULD BE

02:24:53.751 --> 02:24:55.520
LESS CHILDREN SIR. WE DO HAVE

02:24:55.586 --> 02:24:56.821
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY

02:24:56.888 --> 02:24:57.655
OF PROVIDERS TO STAY IN

02:24:57.722 --> 02:24:58.790
BUSINESS IF THEY'RE FACING A

02:24:58.856 --> 02:25:00.224
LOT OF COST PRESSURES AND FOR

02:25:00.291 --> 02:25:02.593
MAKING REDUCTIONS- TO THE

02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:04.629
RATES- THE LEGISLATURE ALSO

02:25:04.695 --> 02:25:06.230
COULD CONSIDER SOME OTHER-

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:07.899
REDUCTIONS THAT DO NOT. GO

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:09.267
DIRECTLY DO NOT ADDRESS

02:25:09.333 --> 02:25:11.569
SERVICES SUCH AS- THE ADMIN

02:25:11.636 --> 02:25:13.304
COSTS FOR ABOUT YOUR PROGRAMS.

02:25:13.371 --> 02:25:15.773
OR THE- THE PRESCHOOL ALREADY

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:18.142
IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM. I'M WE WERE

02:25:18.209 --> 02:25:19.277
NOT ALSO IF THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:25:19.343 --> 02:25:20.411
INTERESTED IN FAVOR DO THING

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:21.813
THE NUMBER. OF SLOTS IN SOME

02:25:21.879 --> 02:25:23.014
WAY WE WOULD RECOMMEND DOING

02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:24.615
THAT BASED ON THE IN. REDUCING

02:25:24.682 --> 02:25:26.150
THE AMOUNT OF ABILITY THRESHOLD

02:25:26.217 --> 02:25:27.819
SO WE'RE STILL PRIORITIZING.

02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:29.253
CHILDREN WITH THE HIGHEST NEED.

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:31.422
AND FAMILIES WITH ITS NEED-

02:25:31.489 --> 02:25:32.657
COUPLE OF OTHER COMMENTS WOULD

02:25:32.723 --> 02:25:33.958
MAKE REGARDING THAT ONE TIME

02:25:34.025 --> 02:25:35.293
FUNDING FROM THE CARES ACT WE

02:25:35.359 --> 02:25:36.894
RECOMMEND USING ALL THAT FOR.

02:25:36.961 --> 02:25:38.796
THE FIRST TAPINGS AGAIN

02:25:38.863 --> 02:25:39.730
RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE SOME

02:25:39.797 --> 02:25:40.398
CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST

02:25:40.465 --> 02:25:42.233
PRESSURES THAT PROVIDERS. WILL

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:43.734
BE FACING. ARE WE THINK ARE

02:25:43.801 --> 02:25:46.771
USING THAT ENTIRE THE HUNDRED

02:25:46.838 --> 02:25:48.272
AND- RATHER THAN JUST BEING ONE

02:25:48.339 --> 02:25:49.941
THIRTY FIVE. I'M NOT DOING ALL

02:25:50.007 --> 02:25:53.578
OF. THE AS- FUNDING DIRECTLY

02:25:53.644 --> 02:25:54.412
PERSPECTIVES TYPE IN THE

02:25:54.479 --> 02:25:55.713
PROVIDING RELIEF FIGHTERS WOULD

02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:57.949
BE- PREFERABLE. WE WOULD NOTE

02:25:58.015 --> 02:26:00.184
THAT THE- THE FIFTY MILLION

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.719
THAT WAS PROVIDED- FOR

02:26:01.786 --> 02:26:03.287
EMERGENCY DOCTORS IN THE

02:26:03.354 --> 02:26:04.288
CURRENT YEAR WE DON'T KNOW MUCH

02:26:04.355 --> 02:26:06.057
ABOUT THAT SPENT. AND SO WE

02:26:06.124 --> 02:26:07.258
THINK THAT ONE ALTERNATIVE TO

02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:08.493
PROVIDING THAT SEVENTY THREE

02:26:08.559 --> 02:26:10.995
MILLION- FOR ADDITIONAL

02:26:11.062 --> 02:26:12.130
TEMPORARY VOUCHERS IS TO MOVE

02:26:12.196 --> 02:26:13.197
AT THE STATE AND- THEN JUST

02:26:13.264 --> 02:26:14.232
ALLOW THE FIFTY MILLION THAT

02:26:14.298 --> 02:26:16.501
WAS. INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT

02:26:16.567 --> 02:26:18.236
YEAR- THROUGH A SECTION THAT

02:26:18.302 --> 02:26:19.837
OFFICE TO ALLOW THAT TO BE USED

02:26:19.904 --> 02:26:22.740
FOR. THE BUDGET YEARS WELL. AND

02:26:22.807 --> 02:26:23.307
FINALLY WE WILL CONTINUE TO

02:26:23.374 --> 02:26:24.142
RECOMMEND REJECT. IN THE

02:26:24.208 --> 02:26:26.444
PROPOSALS FOR REORGANIZATION-

THE GATE THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS

03:23:17.051 --> 03:23:19.921
IS AN ESSENTIAL- COMPONENT

03:23:19.987 --> 03:23:22.256
EVERY OPENING OUR ECONOMY WE

03:23:22.323 --> 03:23:23.324
KNOW THE WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL

03:23:23.391 --> 03:23:24.792
THE SAID OVER AND OVER- BUYER

03:23:24.859 --> 03:23:26.460
GOVERNOR. AND WE REALIZE THAT

03:23:26.527 --> 03:23:28.429
THIS IS A VERY FRAGILE FIELD

03:23:28.496 --> 03:23:30.798
AND WHAT WE DO HERE CAN BOOST

03:23:30.865 --> 03:23:33.568
IT UP OR CONVERSELY CAN REALLY-

03:23:33.634 --> 03:23:35.136
YOU KNOW FRANKLY BUT THE DEATH

WEEK BY A WOMAN NAMED EMILY

03:23:40.374 --> 03:23:44.512
PACK WROTE A COLUMN AND- INTRO

03:23:44.579 --> 03:23:45.079
LINE I THINK SAYS IT ALL IT

SAYS. OUR CENTER. A BIG MONEY

03:23:47.648 --> 03:23:49.917
MAKER BEST OF TIMES BUT RUNNING

03:23:49.984 --> 03:23:51.519
ONE DURING A PANDEMIC IS

03:23:51.586 --> 03:23:52.353
BASICALLY LIKE TAKING A BUNCH

03:23:52.420 --> 03:23:55.089
OF MONEY AND SETTING IT ON FIRE

03:23:55.156 --> 03:23:58.326
SO THAT'S THE REALITY. AND IF

03:23:58.392 --> 03:24:01.329
WE LOWER- THEIR RATIOS FAMILIES

03:24:01.395 --> 03:24:03.764
KIDS CAN BE IN A SITES IF WE

03:24:03.831 --> 03:24:06.334
DECREASE- OF THAT THE RATES IT

03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:08.769
HAS FRANKLY- AN OPPORTUNITY

03:24:08.836 --> 03:24:11.405
HERE YOU KNOW- TO- ESSENTIALLY

03:24:11.472 --> 03:24:13.341
A PROBLEM FOR NON THESE CENTERS

03:24:13.407 --> 03:24:15.076
BUT FOR US TO. REOPEN OUR

03:24:15.142 --> 03:24:16.377
ECONOMY SO I GUESS MY FIRST

03:24:16.444 --> 03:24:17.278
QUESTION IS DEPARTMENT OF

03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:21.182
ESSENTIAL PART. OF THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA WE'VE ALREADY STATE

03:24:23.250 --> 03:24:24.819
STATED THAT THE WORKERS IN THE

03:24:24.885 --> 03:24:27.221
FIELD ARE PART OF THE CENTURY

03:24:27.288 --> 03:24:28.623
OPENING OF CALIFORNIA THEN

03:24:28.689 --> 03:24:29.857
PEOPLE BACK TO WORK THINKING

03:24:29.924 --> 03:24:32.059

GET TO WORK- PART OF THAT IS

03:24:36.697 --> 03:24:39.266
MAKING SURE THEY HAVE A PLACE

03:24:39.333 --> 03:24:43.738
TO PUT THEIR KIDS WE- IS.

03:24:43.804 --> 03:24:44.805
BUDGET AND MAKING SURE THAT WE

03:24:44.872 --> 03:24:46.173

03:25:04.025 --> 03:25:06.527
DECISIONS IN THESE REDUCTIONS

03:25:06.594 --> 03:25:09.830
SO. I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD

03:25:09.897 --> 03:25:11.198
WE WERE LOOKING FOR MORE DATA

03:25:11.265 --> 03:25:13.067
ON UNDERSTANDING THE CLOSURES

03:25:13.134 --> 03:25:15.736

AND THE LEGISLATURE AND KIND

03:25:24.812 --> 03:25:26.647
OF- MAKING SOME OF THESE

03:25:26.714 --> 03:25:32.353
DIFFICULT DECISIONS. THE I'M

ANTHONY AGAIN IS. ADD ALL THESE

03:25:44.065 --> 03:25:45.366
OTHER QUESTIONS YOU'RE WELCOME

03:25:45.433 --> 03:25:48.636
BACK TO THAT. DO WE THINK THAT

03:25:48.703 --> 03:25:50.271
THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US WILL

03:25:50.337 --> 03:25:53.574
ALLOW US TO KEEP THE- THE

03:25:53.641 --> 03:25:56.510
GRADUAL CHILD CARE NETWORK

03:25:56.577 --> 03:25:59.080
GOING IN CALIFORNIA.

03:25:59.146 --> 03:26:00.614
ESSENTIALLY IF WE HAVE TO FACE

03:26:00.681 --> 03:26:02.049
THE TRIGGER CUTS AND I'LL GET

03:26:02.116 --> 03:26:02.983
TO THIS IN A LITTLE BIT THAT

03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:04.785
THAT THE RATE REDUCTIONS DO WE

03:26:04.852 --> 03:26:05.886
THINK THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

03:26:05.953 --> 03:26:07.455
STAY IN BUSINESS KNOWING THAT

03:26:07.521 --> 03:26:09.390
IN THE BEST OF TIMES IT WAS

03:26:09.457 --> 03:26:11.325
ALWAYS FRAGILE. POTENTIALLY

03:26:11.392 --> 03:26:12.993
HAVING TO SEARCH. FOR A KIDS-

03:26:13.060 --> 03:26:15.796
WITH THE NEW. US SAFETY RATIOS.

03:26:15.863 --> 03:26:16.964
WITH GLASS OF THE STATE

03:26:17.031 --> 03:26:18.933
REIMBURSEMENT. DO WE THINK THAT

03:26:18.999 --> 03:26:19.934
THAT THE CENTERS WILL. STAY

03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:22.603
OPEN. AND BE ABLE TO SERVE THE

03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:24.872
NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. THE

03:26:24.939 --> 03:26:26.540
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

03:26:26.607 --> 03:26:27.775
CERTAINLY ASSUMES THAT THERE

03:26:27.842 --> 03:26:29.443
WILL BE THAT THEY WILL STAY

03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:30.644
OPEN WITH THE LOWER RATES AND

03:26:30.711 --> 03:26:32.546
WE'RE HOPING THAT- WITH

03:26:32.613 --> 03:26:34.115
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT

03:26:34.181 --> 03:26:35.182
THE AT LEAST THE TEN PERCENT.

03:26:35.249 --> 03:26:36.917
RATE REDUCTIONS WHICH ARE

03:26:36.984 --> 03:26:39.487
INCLUDED IN THE TRIGGER CUTS

03:26:39.553 --> 03:26:40.020
WILL WILL NOT HAVE TO TAKE

03:26:40.087 --> 03:26:43.224
PLACE. OKAY AND AGAIN THAT GETS

03:26:43.290 --> 03:26:45.326
BACK TO THAT THE ISSUE WE SPOKE

03:26:45.392 --> 03:26:46.994
AT THE VERY BEGINNING IS THAT.

03:26:47.061 --> 03:26:47.862
WE REALLY DON'T HAVE AN

03:26:47.928 --> 03:26:50.331
ADEQUATE PLAN BEER PLAN AND CAN

03:26:50.397 --> 03:26:52.633
IF IN THE END THE- SCENARIO

03:26:52.700 --> 03:26:54.735
THAT THE FEDERAL. SECONDARY

03:26:54.802 --> 03:26:59.440
FEDERAL. CARES PROPOSAL- PET IT

03:26:59.507 --> 03:27:00.307
DOESN'T MATERIALIZE FOR

03:27:00.374 --> 03:27:02.977
CALIFORNIA SO I WANT TO ASK NOW

03:27:03.043 --> 03:27:05.079
ABOUT THE OTHER- POTS OF MONEY

03:27:05.146 --> 03:27:07.281
THAT WE'RE WE ALLOCATED FOR K.

03:27:07.348 --> 03:27:08.215
TWELVE EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT

03:27:08.282 --> 03:27:08.783
THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION

03:27:08.849 --> 03:27:11.685
GOING TO- LEARNING LOSS AND

03:27:11.752 --> 03:27:12.686
THERE'S THE OTHER FOUR BILLION

03:27:12.753 --> 03:27:15.956
ELSEWHERE- AT WHY HAVEN'T SOME

03:27:16.023 --> 03:27:17.625
OF THOSE RESOURCES BEING. A

03:27:17.691 --> 03:27:19.460
BEEN PUT FORTH TO SUPPORT AND

03:27:19.527 --> 03:27:20.828
PROP UP THIS INDUSTRY WHICH WE

03:27:20.895 --> 03:27:23.264
KNOW IS SO CRITICAL TO GETTING

03:27:23.330 --> 03:27:24.198
PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND

03:27:24.265 --> 03:27:26.534
SUPPORTING- THE WORK FORCE IN

03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:30.337
THIS FIELD. WELL WE HAVE THE

03:27:30.404 --> 03:27:31.806
GREATER FIFTY MILLION WHICH IS

03:27:31.872 --> 03:27:32.907
DEDICATED TO THE CARE STOCKS

03:27:32.973 --> 03:27:35.142
FOR- CCTV JEEZ SUPPLEMENTAL

03:27:35.209 --> 03:27:37.178
PAYMENT. THE OTHER FUNDING-

03:27:37.244 --> 03:27:39.246
AGAIN AS YOU KNOW THERE'S- IT'S

03:27:39.313 --> 03:27:41.649
GOING TO SHORT CUTS AND KATE

03:27:41.715 --> 03:27:43.617
TWELVE AND OTHER SITES THE

03:27:43.684 --> 03:27:45.786
BUDGET SO. I REALLY WASN'T

03:27:45.853 --> 03:27:46.620
INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THE

03:27:46.687 --> 03:27:47.621
CONVERSATION FUNDS PUTTING

03:27:47.688 --> 03:27:49.190
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT

03:27:49.256 --> 03:27:52.092
BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE WORK. WE

03:27:52.159 --> 03:27:52.726
HAVE THE CARE TAX MONEY THAT WE

03:27:52.793 --> 03:28:01.836
WERE. I COUNTY. OKAY. LET'S GO

03:28:01.902 --> 03:28:03.838
NOW TO AND I'LL COME BACK IN

03:28:03.904 --> 03:28:07.675
THE SECOND FOR THE ASUS PROGRAM.

03:28:07.741 --> 03:28:12.246
THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. THE

03:28:12.313 --> 03:28:14.415
PROPOSAL IS TO HAVE A RATE

03:28:14.481 --> 03:28:15.749
REDUCTION BACK DOWN TO THE

03:28:15.816 --> 03:28:19.353
INITIAL PROPERTY NINE LEVELS OF

03:28:19.420 --> 03:28:20.855
SEVEN SEVEN FIFTY A DAY DO WE

03:28:20.921 --> 03:28:22.523
THINK THAT WILL ALLOW THE

03:28:22.590 --> 03:28:24.024
PROGRAMS TO STAY OPEN OR WERE

03:28:24.091 --> 03:28:26.393
THEY ALSO SERVE FEWER KIDS AS

03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:27.461
ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE AMOUNT

03:28:27.528 --> 03:28:30.931
MENTIONED IN OUR OUR SO GO. THE

03:28:30.998 --> 03:28:33.834
REDUCTION IS REALLY AT. FOR

03:28:33.901 --> 03:28:35.102
JUST RATE REDUCTION AND NOT

03:28:35.169 --> 03:28:36.537
NECESSARY BUT WITH SOME REALLY

03:28:36.604 --> 03:28:38.372
THE SLOTS BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY

03:28:38.439 --> 03:28:40.474
KEEP AN EYE ON LOOKING AT WHAT

03:28:40.541 --> 03:28:46.413
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT PROGRAM.

03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:47.748
YOU KNOW LAST YEAR DURING THE

03:28:47.815 --> 03:28:50.251
BUDGET. WE TRY TO INCREASE

03:28:50.317 --> 03:28:51.285
AFTER SCHOOL FUNDING THROUGH

03:28:51.352 --> 03:28:54.555
PROP SIXTY FOR THE LEGALIZATION

03:28:54.622 --> 03:28:57.391
OF MARIJUANA. A MEASURE AND

03:28:57.458 --> 03:28:58.559
UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD TO MAKE

03:28:58.626 --> 03:29:00.194
A TRADE OFF AND SO WE USE THOSE

03:29:00.261 --> 03:29:02.563
RESOURCES TO EXPAND. CHILDCARE

03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:05.532
SLOTS AND ONE OF THE PROPOSALS

03:29:05.599 --> 03:29:08.102
THE EP DOCTORS LOTS RIGHT. YES

03:29:08.168 --> 03:29:09.904
YEAH AND SO YOU CAN YEAH AND

03:29:09.970 --> 03:29:11.639
CHAPTER YEAH THAT IS A LOT OF

03:29:11.705 --> 03:29:13.007
THE YOU KNOW KIDS OF COURSE ARE

03:29:13.073 --> 03:29:14.708
SCHOOL AGE SO WE UNDERSTOOD

03:29:14.775 --> 03:29:15.743
THAT THAT IS A TRADE OFF.

03:29:15.809 --> 03:29:18.646
GRANTED THAT THE L. THAT THE

03:29:18.712 --> 03:29:19.513
PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE

03:29:19.580 --> 03:29:20.915

03:29:20.981 --> 03:29:22.049
CALIFORNIA STATE AFTER SCHOOL

03:29:22.116 --> 03:29:23.918
PROGRAM BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.

03:29:23.984 --> 03:29:26.754
THE PROPOSAL THAT THE LA GO

03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:29.223
LAYS OUT IS THAT WE COULD USE

03:29:29.290 --> 03:29:32.293
THOSE MONIES. TO SHORE UP THE

03:29:32.359 --> 03:29:35.429
RATES. IN LIEU OF THE EXPANSION

03:29:35.496 --> 03:29:37.264

03:29:39.433 --> 03:29:40.701
SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK WE

03:29:40.768 --> 03:29:42.036
OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERING I GUESS

03:29:48.108 --> 03:29:50.411
SIR NOBLE MORGAN MENTIONED. IT

03:29:50.477 --> 03:29:52.413

IF YOU REDUCING EVEN MORE DOES

03:29:58.919 --> 03:29:59.887

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IS THAT WE

03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:25.746

CALIFORNIA. IT'S DEMONSTRATED

03:30:37.024 --> 03:30:38.892
THAT IT'S- INADEQUATE BY USING

03:30:38.959 --> 03:30:40.728
THAT THE SURVEYS FROM THAT ARE

03:30:40.794 --> 03:30:42.229
COUPLE YEARS OLD. AS YOU KNOW

03:30:42.296 --> 03:30:43.797
THERE'S TWO PROPOSALS IN THE

03:30:43.864 --> 03:30:45.232
LEGISLATURE AB ONE IS ONE THE

03:30:45.299 --> 03:30:48.035
SENATE. TO REFORM THIS AND

03:30:48.102 --> 03:30:49.670
INCREASE TAKE MAKE SURE THAT

03:30:49.737 --> 03:30:51.505
THE THESE PROGRAMS CAN STAY

03:30:51.572 --> 03:30:54.208
HALL AND FRANKLY EXPANDED SERVE

03:30:54.274 --> 03:30:56.110
MORE KIDS. SO THE QUESTION THAT

03:30:56.176 --> 03:30:58.479
WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES IS IF

03:30:58.545 --> 03:31:01.181
YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW THE

03:31:01.248 --> 03:31:04.885
TRIGGER GOES INTO A FACT WHAT

03:31:04.952 --> 03:31:06.220
WILL THIS MEAN DO WE DO WE

03:31:06.286 --> 03:31:07.755
REALLY THINK THAT THAT THESE

03:31:07.821 --> 03:31:08.889
PROGRAMS WILL REMAIN

03:31:08.956 --> 03:31:10.591
FINANCIALLY VIABLE OR WERE THEY

03:31:10.657 --> 03:31:13.160
CLOSE. THEIR DOORS AND SO AGAIN

03:31:13.227 --> 03:31:15.429
I ASK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IF

03:31:15.496 --> 03:31:17.331
WE HADN'T DO THESE 10% CUTS IF

03:31:17.398 --> 03:31:18.665
WE HAD TO GO AND PULL THE

03:31:18.732 --> 03:31:19.767
TRIGGER BECAUSE THERE'S NO

03:31:19.833 --> 03:31:21.902
FEDERAL BAILOUT. WHAT DO YOU

03:31:21.969 --> 03:31:22.736
THINK WOULD HAPPEN THERE ARE

03:31:22.803 --> 03:31:24.838
PROGRAMS ARE EASY PATCHWORK OF

03:31:24.905 --> 03:31:28.108
PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN- THE CHILD

03:31:28.175 --> 03:31:30.744
CARE WORLD IN THE AND IT'S PART

03:31:30.811 --> 03:31:31.345
DAY PRESCHOOL IN FULL DAY PRE

03:31:31.412 --> 03:31:36.316
SCHOOL. I REALLY DON'T HAVE A

03:31:36.383 --> 03:31:37.918
COMMENT ON THAT I CAN'T I CAN'T

03:31:37.985 --> 03:31:39.753
PROJECT WHAT THIS WILL BE IT'S

03:31:39.820 --> 03:31:41.488
NOT OUR INTENT THAT WITH OUR

03:31:41.555 --> 03:31:43.957
INTENT WAS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS-

03:31:44.024 --> 03:31:45.025
I KNOW THE MASTER PLAN FOR

03:31:45.092 --> 03:31:45.893
EARLY LEARNING CARE IS

03:31:45.959 --> 03:31:47.094
CONTINUING THEIR EFFORTS AND

03:31:47.161 --> 03:31:49.229
WE'RE HOPING THATA WITH WHAT

03:31:49.296 --> 03:31:50.731
THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT THERE

03:31:50.798 --> 03:31:52.366
WILL BE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS-

03:31:52.433 --> 03:31:56.603
MOVING FORWARD. WITH THAT THE

03:31:56.670 --> 03:32:01.075
MASTER PLAN. YES YEAH WELL I

03:32:01.141 --> 03:32:02.976
KNOW THAT THE MASTER PLAN AT

03:32:03.043 --> 03:32:05.913
ISSUE MORE NOT LESS AND SO IT'S

03:32:05.979 --> 03:32:07.514
OUR GREAT FEAR THAT THAT THE

03:32:07.581 --> 03:32:10.584
WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER

03:32:10.651 --> 03:32:12.753
AND ONE. THESE THESE PROGRAMS

03:32:12.820 --> 03:32:13.921
PEOPLE TO WORK IN THIS FIELD

03:32:13.987 --> 03:32:15.622
WOULD POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW LOSE

03:32:15.689 --> 03:32:17.224
THEIR LIVELIHOOD LOSE THEIR

03:32:17.291 --> 03:32:18.358
JOBS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. WE

03:32:18.425 --> 03:32:20.727
LOSE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO SEND

03:32:20.794 --> 03:32:22.029
THEIR KIDS AND GET BACK TO WORK

03:32:22.096 --> 03:32:23.530
AND SO YOU KNOW MY FRIEND OVER

03:32:23.597 --> 03:32:24.765
HERE MISTER GALLAGHER SAYS THE

03:32:24.832 --> 03:32:26.400
ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO DO.

03:32:26.467 --> 03:32:27.768
TO FIX OUR ECONOMY ISRAEL BUT

03:32:27.835 --> 03:32:29.503
ECONOMY PEOPLE BACK TO WORK BUT

03:32:29.570 --> 03:32:30.771
HOW CAN PEOPLE COULD GET BACK

03:32:30.838 --> 03:32:32.139
TO WORK IF THEY HAVE NO PLACE

03:32:32.206 --> 03:32:33.006
TO SEND THEIR KIDS DURING THE

03:32:33.073 --> 03:32:34.808
DAY. WELL THAT'S OUR K. TWELVE

03:32:34.875 --> 03:32:36.844
SCHOOL SYSTEM. FOR OUR CHILD

03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:38.278
CARE CENTERS AND EAT AND

03:32:38.345 --> 03:32:40.414
COURSES ARE SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS

03:32:40.481 --> 03:32:41.915
BUT WE KNOW A LOT OF THEM A

03:32:41.982 --> 03:32:43.650
BLIND BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN.

03:32:43.717 --> 03:32:45.219
AND PRIVATE PAY AND SUBSIDIZE

03:32:45.285 --> 03:32:47.488
AS WELL SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT

03:32:47.554 --> 03:32:49.490
GREAT CONCERN. ABOUT IS THAT WE

03:32:49.556 --> 03:32:52.593
NEED TO. ONE THINK ABOUT IT

03:32:52.659 --> 03:32:55.229
THERE A PLAN B. TO MITIGATE.

03:32:55.295 --> 03:32:57.397
POTENTIAL TRIGGER CUTS OR- IF

03:32:57.464 --> 03:32:58.799
THAT DOESN'T COME THROUGH. YOU

03:32:58.866 --> 03:33:00.634
KNOW. THE OTHER DISCRETIONARY

03:33:00.701 --> 03:33:02.503
MONIES THAT ARE IN ELSEWHERE IN

03:33:02.569 --> 03:33:03.871
THE BUDGET I KNOW THAT.

03:33:03.937 --> 03:33:04.905
WHATEVER ACTION WE TAKE

03:33:04.972 --> 03:33:06.073
SOMEWHERE ELSE HAS THE IMPACTS

03:33:06.140 --> 03:33:07.107
SOMEBODY ELSE AS WELL BUT THIS

03:33:07.174 --> 03:33:10.043
IS SUCH A KEY. PIECE OF OUR- OF

03:33:10.110 --> 03:33:12.212
GETTING OUR ECONOMY BACK IN

03:33:12.279 --> 03:33:16.016
ORDER- OKAY NEXT I WANT TO TALK

03:33:16.083 --> 03:33:20.954
ABOUT. THE SHIFT TO. DS S. AND-

03:33:21.021 --> 03:33:22.289
I THINK WE HAD A LOT OF

03:33:22.356 --> 03:33:24.124
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. IN

03:33:24.191 --> 03:33:26.126
JANUARY QUICK CREATING ITS OWN

03:33:26.193 --> 03:33:29.563
DEPARTMENT. AND I THINK THAT

03:33:29.630 --> 03:33:31.265
THERE ARE PROBABLY. HE WAS A

03:33:31.331 --> 03:33:31.965
LITTLE BIT TAKE HINGED. WHERE

03:33:32.032 --> 03:33:33.433
AND I WOULD. MORE THIRTY DAY

03:33:33.500 --> 03:33:36.003
AND SO. THE QUESTION IS DO WE

03:33:36.069 --> 03:33:37.104
THINK THAT'S ESSENTIAL. TO

03:33:37.171 --> 03:33:39.606
CREATE. TO DO THE SHOW. THAT

03:33:39.673 --> 03:33:41.808
THAT. OCCUR PRO. IS FROM. CITY

03:33:41.875 --> 03:33:44.211
TO DEPARTMENT ALSO SERVE. IN IN

03:33:44.278 --> 03:33:46.079
LARGE PART. BECAUSE IT'S SUCH

03:33:46.146 --> 03:33:48.949
A- THAT. SHIFT IN IT AND THAT

03:33:49.016 --> 03:33:51.451
IN A- THIS TIME RIGHT NOW WE'RE

03:33:51.518 --> 03:33:53.387
NOT WE'RE- STEADY AND-

03:33:53.453 --> 03:33:56.857
LEADERSHIP IN THIS. ANYWAY AND

03:33:56.924 --> 03:34:03.130
THEN SECONDLY IS AT. BUT TO ME.

03:34:03.197 --> 03:34:05.766
HOW HE SAID MONIES THAT. THAT

03:34:05.832 --> 03:34:07.201
THE PROBING DURING THE NINETEEN

03:34:07.267 --> 03:34:09.002
PARA. IT IS PART OF THE

03:34:09.069 --> 03:34:09.870
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED YESAND

03:34:09.937 --> 03:34:10.671
WE DO BY IT IS AND IN ORDER TO

03:34:10.737 --> 03:34:12.606
A ON THIS THE PROBE ENERGY

03:34:12.673 --> 03:34:13.974
GOING FORWARD. ON THE TWO

03:34:14.041 --> 03:34:14.808
MILLION DOLLARS IS QUITE

03:34:14.875 --> 03:34:16.176
FLEXIBLE THAT'S JUST TO START

03:34:16.243 --> 03:34:21.114
THE TRANSITION- AND- THE- THE

03:34:21.181 --> 03:34:22.649

03:34:22.716 --> 03:34:24.985
PLAN ARE IN ANOTHER- AGENCIES

03:34:25.052 --> 03:34:26.787
SO- UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE HAVING

03:34:26.853 --> 03:34:28.722
BACK TO BACK. HEARINGS TO THE

03:34:28.789 --> 03:34:30.023

RECOMMENDATIONS SO- WOULD WANT

03:34:52.579 --> 03:34:56.283
ONE WAS. THE POLICY THAT I

03:34:56.350 --> 03:34:57.818

THOSE FUNDS OVER THERE WITH

03:35:41.295 --> 03:35:43.864

RECOGNIZE THAT IT THIS IS

03:36:02.215 --> 03:36:02.849
TYPICALLY NOT SOMETHING YOU

03:36:02.916 --> 03:36:04.584

MAGNITUDE OF THOSE REDUCTION TO

03:36:14.594 --> 03:36:15.962
TEN PERCENT. RATE REDUCTION

03:36:16.029 --> 03:36:17.597
THAN GIVEN ALREADY THE COST

03:36:17.664 --> 03:36:18.565
PRESSURES THE PROVIDER ARE

03:36:18.632 --> 03:36:20.100
FEELING RIGHT NOW THAT RATHER

03:36:20.167 --> 03:36:21.868
THAN ISSUING THE SLOTS WHICH

YOU'RE GONNA BE ARE DIRECTLY

03:36:25.405 --> 03:36:26.707
HARMING BY DOING THIS BUT

03:36:26.773 --> 03:36:28.308
INSTEAD OF REDIRECTING THOSE

03:36:28.375 --> 03:36:30.177
FUNDS TO HELP STATE REDUCE THE

03:36:30.243 --> 03:36:33.246
MAGNITUDE OF THOSE RATE THAT'S

03:36:33.313 --> 03:36:35.048
WHAT HELPED. THEY BY FOR

03:36:35.115 --> 03:36:37.184
PROVIDERS AND AVOID. SOME OF

03:36:37.250 --> 03:36:39.519
THEM I MEAN CLOTHES. YEAH SO IS

03:36:39.586 --> 03:36:40.153
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

03:36:40.220 --> 03:36:41.855
POTENTIALLY THERE ARE FIVE

03:36:41.922 --> 03:36:42.622
THOUSAND FAMILIES ON A WAITING

03:36:42.689 --> 03:36:45.192
LIST THAT DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE

03:36:45.258 --> 03:36:46.593
CHILD CARE THAT COULD

03:36:46.660 --> 03:36:48.128
POTENTIALLY GET IT. WITH THESE

03:36:48.195 --> 03:36:50.430
PROP SIXTY FOUR MONIES OF LAST

03:36:50.497 --> 03:36:52.499
YEAR'S EXPANSION SO THAT

03:36:52.566 --> 03:36:53.767
THEY'RE NOT LOSING ANYTHING

03:36:53.834 --> 03:36:54.368
THAT THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE

03:36:54.434 --> 03:36:56.436
RIGHT NOW. BUT PRESSURES

03:36:56.503 --> 03:36:58.071
NOTHING BUT CONVERSELY IF YOU

03:36:58.138 --> 03:37:00.507
HAVE A- DISASTROUS A RATE

03:37:00.574 --> 03:37:01.942
REDUCTION THERE'S TENS OF

03:37:02.008 --> 03:37:03.276
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES COULD

03:37:03.343 --> 03:37:04.878
THEY COULD GET KICKED OUT SO

03:37:04.945 --> 03:37:05.779
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE NOT CALLING

SO. I THINK IT'S JUST THE RISK

03:37:17.657 --> 03:37:18.959
REWARD ANALYSIS WE NEED TO DO

03:37:19.025 --> 03:37:20.660
WHAT'S THE BEST USE THAT AND

03:37:20.727 --> 03:37:22.729
IT'S PAINFUL TO BECAUSE YOU'RE-

03:37:22.796 --> 03:37:23.663
ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL

03:37:23.730 --> 03:37:25.699
THEY'RE BOTH- CHILD CARE.

03:37:25.766 --> 03:37:27.801
ACCESS BUT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

03:37:27.868 --> 03:37:29.803
WHAT IS YOU KNOW AT WHAT WHAT

03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:31.738
WOULD HAVE THE BIGGEST. IMPACT

03:37:31.805 --> 03:37:33.673
AND FRANKLY THE BIGGEST

03:37:33.740 --> 03:37:35.375
NEGATIVE IMPACT RIGHT. THAT'S

03:37:35.442 --> 03:37:36.309
RIGHT AND THAT'S KIND OF A

03:37:36.376 --> 03:37:37.077
CONSISTENT FROM A

03:37:37.144 --> 03:37:38.578
RECOMMENDATION SIMILARLY WHERE

03:37:38.645 --> 03:37:40.414
WE RECOMMEND TAKING THE FUNDING

03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:41.782
FOR TEMPORARY VOUCHERS INSTEAD

03:37:41.848 --> 03:37:43.583
USING IT PERSPECTIVES. I AM

03:37:43.650 --> 03:37:45.218
AGAINST THE MOTHERLY CONCERN

03:37:45.285 --> 03:37:46.853
ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE

03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:48.488
CUTS TO PROVIDERS AND WHAT THAT

03:37:48.555 --> 03:37:50.590
MIGHT MEAN FOR THEIR- LONG TERM

03:37:50.657 --> 03:37:52.192
SUSTAINABILITY. SO WHAT THE WE

03:37:52.259 --> 03:37:53.794
RECOGNIZE. ALWAYS WANTING TO

03:37:53.860 --> 03:37:55.529
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACTORS

03:37:55.595 --> 03:37:57.831
IMPORTANT WE ARE CONCERNED-

03:37:57.898 --> 03:37:58.665
ABOUT THESE COST PRESSURES

03:37:58.732 --> 03:38:00.367
PARTICULAR RIGHT NOW GIVEN. ALL

03:38:00.434 --> 03:38:01.768
OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT

03:38:01.835 --> 03:38:04.371
ARE GONE AS WERE INDEPENDENT.

03:38:04.438 --> 03:38:05.338
YET MAYBE YOU CAN HELP US

03:38:05.405 --> 03:38:06.540
UNDERSTAND THIS AT YOUR BECAUSE

03:38:06.606 --> 03:38:08.475
IT'S LIKE A GAME OF CHESS RIGHT

03:38:08.542 --> 03:38:10.877
YOU MOVE ONE PIECE AND- HAS AN

03:38:10.944 --> 03:38:12.879
IMPACT OVER HERE AND THEN. YOU

03:38:12.946 --> 03:38:13.747
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

03:38:13.814 --> 03:38:15.449
HAPPEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

03:38:15.515 --> 03:38:18.185
RIGHT. SO HAVE. YOU YOU WOULD

03:38:18.251 --> 03:38:20.320
ESSENTIALLY CONSIDERED PULLING

03:38:20.387 --> 03:38:23.356
THIS- HE COULD CONSIDER GOING

03:38:23.423 --> 03:38:25.091
ON THIS PATH. IF WE DIDN'T GET

03:38:25.158 --> 03:38:26.660
THE FEDERAL MONEY BUT WHEN DO

03:38:26.726 --> 03:38:28.495
WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE WERE

03:38:28.562 --> 03:38:29.629
TRYING TO. PUT OUR BUDGET

03:38:29.696 --> 03:38:31.364
TOGETHER AND HAVE IT READY TO

03:38:31.431 --> 03:38:33.266
VOTE ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR IN.

03:38:33.333 --> 03:38:35.735
TWO WEEKS OR SO AND WHAT THE

03:38:35.802 --> 03:38:36.937
TIME LINE FOR US TO FIGURE OUT

03:38:37.003 --> 03:38:37.637
WHAT'S HAPPENING THE FEDERAL

03:38:37.704 --> 03:38:42.309
LEVEL- TO MAKE THIS DECISION.

03:38:42.375 --> 03:38:43.009
RIGHT I THOUGHT OBVIOUSLY A

03:38:43.076 --> 03:38:44.811
VERY DIFFICULT ON GIVEN THAT

03:38:44.878 --> 03:38:46.646
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO. NO WORK

03:38:46.713 --> 03:38:47.981
HERE THE YOU KNOW THIS IS THESE

03:38:48.048 --> 03:38:50.150
TRIGGERS ARE DIFFERENT FROM SAY

03:38:50.217 --> 03:38:51.551
FOR EXAMPLE TRIGGERS OUT THE

03:38:51.618 --> 03:38:54.187
STATE IMPLEMENTED- OR OR

03:38:54.254 --> 03:38:55.889
ENACTED WHEN WE PUT PROP THIRTY

03:38:55.956 --> 03:38:56.890
ON THE BALLOT AT LEAST THERE

03:38:56.957 --> 03:38:57.991
WAS SOME VERY CLEAR CERTAINTY

03:38:58.058 --> 03:38:59.659
ABOUT. IT IS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE

03:38:59.726 --> 03:39:01.027
IF THE MEASURE FAILED WITH WHAT

03:39:01.094 --> 03:39:02.395
HAPPENS IF THE MEASURE PASSES

03:39:02.462 --> 03:39:03.697
HERE THEY'RE SORT OF LIKE THE

03:39:03.763 --> 03:39:05.365
STATE COULD GIVE ZERO TWO WHO

03:39:05.432 --> 03:39:06.766
KNOWS HOW MUCH FUNDING TO BACK

03:39:06.833 --> 03:39:07.701
OF THESE TRIGGERS THAT DOES

03:39:07.767 --> 03:39:09.703
CREATE SOME UNCERTAINTY- IN

03:39:09.769 --> 03:39:12.639
DECIDING HOW TO HOW YOU WANT TO

03:39:12.706 --> 03:39:13.840
MOVE FORWARD. YEAH OKAY AND

03:39:13.907 --> 03:39:16.443
THEN. HOW HOW DOES THIS- PLAY

03:39:16.510 --> 03:39:20.881
OUT WITH. MAYBE THIS IS FOR CD

03:39:20.947 --> 03:39:22.249
FOR SERRA THAT MORGAN RIGHT

03:39:22.315 --> 03:39:24.084
THERE HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT

03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:26.419
WITH THESE LOWER CHILD TO ADULT

03:39:26.486 --> 03:39:27.988
RATIOS IN THE SMALLER GROUP

03:39:28.054 --> 03:39:29.990
SIZES AS THE ELLIE TALKS ABOUT

03:39:30.056 --> 03:39:32.659
IT HOW DOES THIS. HOW DOES MAKE

03:39:32.726 --> 03:39:36.062
THESE. WHETHER IT'S A FAMILY

03:39:36.129 --> 03:39:40.367
FAMILY BASED- HOME OR A CENTER.

03:39:40.433 --> 03:39:42.102
HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT

03:39:42.168 --> 03:39:46.039
PENCIL OUT FINANCIALLY. SEVEN

03:39:46.106 --> 03:39:47.641
THIS IS THERE IT DOESN'T REALLY

03:39:47.707 --> 03:39:49.042
PENCIL OUT SO IT WILL MEAN

03:39:49.109 --> 03:39:50.777
INCREASED COSTS FOR THE PROGRAM

03:39:50.844 --> 03:39:51.978
SAID THEY HAVE DONE A SURVEY

03:39:52.045 --> 03:39:52.812
AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ACTUALLY

03:39:52.879 --> 03:39:55.181
GET SOME PUBLIC COMMENT IN A

03:39:55.248 --> 03:39:56.616
LITTLE BIT THAT ADDRESSES THAT

03:39:56.683 --> 03:39:58.385
BETTER THAN I WELL. BUT SOME OF

03:39:58.451 --> 03:40:01.755
WHAT THEY PROVIDED TO US IS THE

03:40:01.821 --> 03:40:02.322
ELEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED

03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:03.890
COED COSTS PER CLASSROOM AND

03:40:03.957 --> 03:40:07.060
NOT 43% INCREASE COSTS DUE TO

03:40:07.127 --> 03:40:09.563
THOSE REDUCE GROUPS ACCESS SO

03:40:09.629 --> 03:40:10.363
YOU HAVE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL

03:40:10.430 --> 03:40:11.965
STAFF TO COME IN AND ADDRESS

03:40:12.032 --> 03:40:14.434
THOSE- SMALLER GRIP SIZES AND

03:40:14.501 --> 03:40:15.402
THEN OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU'RE

03:40:15.468 --> 03:40:16.403
HAVING TO DO PRETTY INTENSE

03:40:16.469 --> 03:40:17.437
CLEANING EVERY DAY THAT

03:40:17.504 --> 03:40:19.573
INCREASES COSTS. IN STAFF TIME

03:40:19.639 --> 03:40:21.875
AS WELL WE HAD AN EXAMPLE FROM

03:40:21.942 --> 03:40:23.410
ONE OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES THAT

03:40:23.476 --> 03:40:26.980
THE 10% CUT WILL COST THEM

03:40:27.047 --> 03:40:27.581
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THE

03:40:27.647 --> 03:40:30.150
CLEANING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

03:40:30.216 --> 03:40:30.884
SIXTY THOUSAND SO ALMOST A

03:40:30.951 --> 03:40:32.552
MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY WOULD

03:40:32.619 --> 03:40:35.155
LOSE IN ONE YEAR AS THEY IF

03:40:35.221 --> 03:40:36.556
THEY WERE ABLE TO KEEP MOVING

03:40:36.623 --> 03:40:39.259
FORWARD WITH. HAVING OUR

03:40:39.326 --> 03:40:41.895
PROGRAMS. YES SO IT KIND OF

03:40:41.962 --> 03:40:44.097
WHAT I SAID EARLIER THAT IN THE

03:40:44.164 --> 03:40:45.932
BEST OF TIMES THESE ARE.

03:40:45.999 --> 03:40:48.168
ALLOCATE BUSINESSES AND THEY

03:40:48.234 --> 03:40:50.003
THEY THEY CAN BARELY HANG ON

03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:52.072
AND DURING THIS ERA. THE QUOTE

03:40:52.138 --> 03:40:53.373
WAS IT'S LIKE TAKING A BUNCH OF

03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:54.708
MONEY IN SETTING A FIRE NOT

03:40:54.774 --> 03:40:56.109
SAYING THAT'S WHAT TALK IS THAT

03:40:56.176 --> 03:40:58.745
IS ARE WE BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY

03:40:58.812 --> 03:40:59.346
DO WHAT WE DON'T TO HAPPEN OF

03:40:59.412 --> 03:41:01.081
COURSE SO. WITH THE RATE CUT

03:41:01.147 --> 03:41:04.417
AND ATTENTION LEADS DOLE TO

03:41:04.484 --> 03:41:07.020
CHILD RATIOS WHAT DO YOU THINK

03:41:07.087 --> 03:41:09.422
WOULD HAPPEN AT THE CENTERS. I

03:41:09.489 --> 03:41:10.256
DON'T THINK MY CENTERS COULD

03:41:10.323 --> 03:41:11.791
CONTINUE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE

03:41:11.858 --> 03:41:13.593
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL

03:41:13.660 --> 03:41:15.362
FINDS TO DO THAT'S I THINK YOU

03:41:15.428 --> 03:41:16.596
QUOTED SOMEBODY IS THAT THEY'RE

03:41:16.663 --> 03:41:18.531
NOT IN THIS FOR THE MONEY SO WE

03:41:18.598 --> 03:41:20.667
SEE ALL THE TIME THAT FROM OUR

03:41:20.734 --> 03:41:22.569
CONTRACTORS WHO WE WORK WITH.

03:41:22.636 --> 03:41:23.570
HOW CLOSE TO THE EDGE THEY ARE

03:41:23.637 --> 03:41:24.871
AND ACTUALLY OUR FISCAL STAFF

03:41:24.938 --> 03:41:26.506
HAVE TO GIVE A LOT OF TECHNICAL

03:41:26.573 --> 03:41:28.508
ASSISTANCE TO THE FIELD AROUND

03:41:28.575 --> 03:41:30.176
HOW TO STAY SOLVENT AND SO IF

03:41:30.243 --> 03:41:30.944
THAT'S SOMETHING THEY'RE DOING

03:41:31.011 --> 03:41:32.545
WHEN THEY ARE HAVE THE CURRENT

03:41:32.612 --> 03:41:33.780
RATES AND WEREN'T HAVING

03:41:33.847 --> 03:41:35.281
ADDRESS A SMALLER GRIP SIZES.

03:41:35.348 --> 03:41:37.484
RATIOS AND ENHANCE CLEANING WE

03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:38.885
KNOW IT WILL BE MORE CRIME

03:41:38.952 --> 03:41:40.520
PROBLEMATIC MOVING FORWARD AND

03:41:40.587 --> 03:41:43.590
COVERED NINETEEN WORLD. YES SO

03:41:43.657 --> 03:41:45.191
I THINK THAT THE QUESTION WE

03:41:45.258 --> 03:41:46.726
HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IS

03:41:46.793 --> 03:41:48.928
THERE'S- I THINK THE CENTERS OF

03:41:48.995 --> 03:41:50.030
PROBABLY ASK FOR MORE

03:41:50.096 --> 03:41:52.832
RESOURCES. YOU KNOW WE BAIL OUT

03:41:52.899 --> 03:41:55.101
CERTAIN PLACES IN THE- IN THE

03:41:55.168 --> 03:41:57.003
ECONOMY AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL

03:41:57.070 --> 03:41:57.837
NOT TOO MUCH HERE WE CAN'T

03:41:57.904 --> 03:42:00.073
PRINT MONEY. BUT MAYBE NOT A

03:42:00.140 --> 03:42:02.475
BAILOUT BUT SHOULD BE FOCUS ON

03:42:02.542 --> 03:42:04.511
NOT DOING ANY HARM RIGHT. AND I

03:42:04.577 --> 03:42:05.679
THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE

03:42:05.745 --> 03:42:07.580
IS WE'RE NOT JUST KEEPING IT AT

03:42:07.647 --> 03:42:10.050
BAY WE HAVE PROPOSALS TO. IT TO

03:42:10.116 --> 03:42:12.419
INCREASE- RATES A ROOF AND

03:42:12.485 --> 03:42:13.987
REFORM THE RATE STRUCTURE FOR

03:42:14.054 --> 03:42:15.221
YOU SEE PROGRAMS AND THAT'S YOU

03:42:15.288 --> 03:42:16.990
KNOW FRANKLY KINDA HARD TO PUSH

03:42:17.057 --> 03:42:18.158
FOR DURING THIS COVER NINETEEN

03:42:18.224 --> 03:42:20.560
ERA. BUT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

03:42:20.627 --> 03:42:22.595
AND THIS MAY REVISED PACKAGE IS

03:42:22.662 --> 03:42:24.631
ABSOLUTE HARM IT'S LIKE THE

03:42:24.698 --> 03:42:26.066
WORLD OF MEDICINE DO NO HARM

03:42:26.132 --> 03:42:28.334
AND SO THESE REALLY- DO HARM SO

03:42:28.401 --> 03:42:30.036
I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY.

03:42:30.103 --> 03:42:32.005
MINDFUL ABOUT THAT AGAIN IT'S

03:42:32.072 --> 03:42:33.073
NOT JUST WHAT'S MORALLYRIGHT

03:42:33.139 --> 03:42:34.808
BUT IF YOU WANT THE ECONOMY NOT

03:42:34.874 --> 03:42:36.543
TO CRATER YOU NEED TO HAVE-

03:42:36.609 --> 03:42:38.511
FINANCIALLY VIABLE CHILD CARE

03:42:38.578 --> 03:42:42.115
IN OUR IN OUR STATE. I THINK I

03:42:42.182 --> 03:42:44.117
HAVE. A QUESTION A COME BACK TO

03:43:00.300 --> 03:43:02.769
CHILD CARE- INFRASTRUCTURE I

03:43:02.836 --> 03:43:04.237

03:43:19.552 --> 03:43:21.988
CARE IN SCHOOL RE OPENING IS

03:43:22.055 --> 03:43:25.892
HOW OUR BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC

03:43:25.959 --> 03:43:27.260
SIDE OF THE YEAH. AND IF THEY

AND I AM I MEAN I'M TRULY

03:43:31.498 --> 03:43:34.200
CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL

03:43:34.267 --> 03:43:36.836
FOR ARM ARE AND AT S. R. OR-

03:43:36.903 --> 03:43:39.305
RATES I HAD TO BE CUT BY TEN

03:43:39.372 --> 03:43:41.374
PERCENT. I THINK THAT THAT IS A

03:43:41.441 --> 03:43:43.576
MAJOR MAJOR CONCERN WE ARE

03:43:43.643 --> 03:43:45.478
READING- I DON'T THINK THEY'RE

03:43:45.545 --> 03:43:48.348
KIND OF VETTED STUDIES YET BUT-

03:43:48.414 --> 03:43:51.017
KIND OF PROGNOSIS AN ANALYSIS

03:43:51.084 --> 03:43:53.620
THAT SOME OF THESE MAY NEVER

03:43:53.686 --> 03:43:56.122
COME. BACK IF WE LOSE SOME OF

03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:57.824
THESE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THEY

03:43:57.891 --> 03:44:01.494
MAY NEVER COME BACK AND- THAT

03:44:01.561 --> 03:44:03.630
IS. UNBELIEVABLY CONCERNING AND

03:44:03.696 --> 03:44:06.132
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE FOLKS

03:44:06.199 --> 03:44:08.234
TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND

03:44:08.301 --> 03:44:09.469
I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS A

03:44:09.536 --> 03:44:11.237
SMALL WORKING GROUP ON THIS

03:44:11.304 --> 03:44:13.206
VERY ISSUE- BECAUSE WE SHARE

03:44:13.273 --> 03:44:15.775
THE CONCERNS- BUT EIGHT THINK

03:44:15.842 --> 03:44:18.211
FREE MEME. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE

03:44:18.278 --> 03:44:20.180
OUT I MEAN IT ASK QUESTIONS

03:44:20.246 --> 03:44:21.347
THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT A

03:44:21.414 --> 03:44:23.416
TYPICALLY ASK IN A BUDGET BUT

03:44:23.483 --> 03:44:26.486
WHAT VALUES GUIDED YOU TO MAKE

03:44:26.553 --> 03:44:28.354
THESE DECISIONS ABOUT THE

03:44:28.421 --> 03:44:30.089
PROPOSAL WERE SEEN AND I KNOW I

03:44:30.156 --> 03:44:31.791
DON'T TYPICALLY ASK THOSE KINDS

03:44:31.858 --> 03:44:33.326
OF QUESTIONS THEY GET DEEP DOWN

03:44:33.393 --> 03:44:35.128
BUT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

03:44:35.195 --> 03:44:36.663
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE

03:44:36.729 --> 03:44:38.031
AND WHAT VALUES ARE IMPORTANT

03:44:38.097 --> 03:44:41.668
TO US TO UNDER STAND. WHAT CAN

03:44:41.734 --> 03:44:43.002
FRONT OF US BECAUSE WHAT'S IN

03:44:43.069 --> 03:44:44.337
FRONT OF IT HURTS IT HURTS A

03:44:44.404 --> 03:44:47.640
LOT- AND- I GET THAT THE

03:44:47.707 --> 03:44:49.042
MONEY'S NOT THERE BUT I ALSO

03:44:49.108 --> 03:44:50.276
JUST THINK LIKE WE'RE NOT

03:44:50.343 --> 03:44:51.144
GETTING SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS

03:44:51.211 --> 03:44:53.179
BACK EVER. AT LEAST I AND I'M

03:44:53.246 --> 03:44:54.814
NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT'S YOU

03:44:54.881 --> 03:44:56.549
KNOW PREDICTING A SO IF YOU

03:44:56.616 --> 03:44:58.251
COULD JUST EXPLAIN TO US WHAT'S

03:44:58.318 --> 03:44:59.819
IN FRONT OF US. IN TERMS OF

03:44:59.886 --> 03:45:02.288
VALUES IN HOW YOU ALL CAME TO

03:45:02.355 --> 03:45:08.161
THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. SO I

03:45:08.228 --> 03:45:09.796
THINK THAT'S PROBABLY FOR

03:45:09.863 --> 03:45:22.375
FINANCE NOT FOR ME. THE SCREEN

03:45:22.442 --> 03:45:26.179
BUT THE CAMERA I KNOW. SO I

03:45:26.246 --> 03:45:28.414
DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO STATE

03:45:28.481 --> 03:45:31.017
THAT AS A VALUE AS A VALUE

03:45:31.084 --> 03:45:32.552
STATEMENT THESE ARE DIFFICULT

03:45:32.619 --> 03:45:33.620
DIFFICULT CUTS FOR THE

03:45:33.686 --> 03:45:35.488
ADMINISTRATION THIS IS ON SCENE

03:45:35.555 --> 03:45:37.423
DROPS. OUT THAT WE'VE NEVER

03:45:37.490 --> 03:45:38.658
EXPERIENCED BEFORE IN

03:45:38.725 --> 03:45:40.593
CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS ABOUT

03:45:40.660 --> 03:45:41.794
BALANCING THE BUDGET AND THE

03:45:41.861 --> 03:45:42.829
FISCAL HEALTH OF STATE OF

03:45:42.896 --> 03:45:44.731
CALIFORNIA AND EVERY PIECE OF

03:45:44.797 --> 03:45:46.699
OUR BUDGET PARTICIPATING IN

03:45:46.766 --> 03:45:48.635
MAKING SURE THAT WE REACH THIS

03:45:48.701 --> 03:45:52.105
BALANCE SO- I JUST WOULD LIKE

03:45:52.171 --> 03:45:54.941
TO MAKE THAT POINT. OKAY SO

03:45:55.008 --> 03:45:57.076
THEN WHAT PRINCIPLES WERE USED

03:45:57.143 --> 03:45:57.977
IN PANIC COMING TO THIS

03:45:58.044 --> 03:45:59.612
PROPOSAL. AND I THINK THAT'S

03:45:59.679 --> 03:46:01.447
FAIR THIS CT I MEAN WHAT I'M

03:46:01.514 --> 03:46:02.615
SENSING FROM YOU IS THAT IT'S

03:46:02.682 --> 03:46:04.484
EQUALLY HARD SO I'M JUST TRYING

03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:05.652
TO WHAT WAS THE GUIDING.

03:46:05.718 --> 03:46:07.120
PRINCIPLES IF IT'S NOT VALUES

03:46:07.186 --> 03:46:08.988
THAT KIND OF GOT IT HERE HOW

03:46:09.055 --> 03:46:11.057
DID WE THINK ABOUT THIS. IT WAS

03:46:11.124 --> 03:46:13.359
ABOUT EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF

03:46:13.426 --> 03:46:14.394
THE REDUCTIONS SO YOU WILL SEE

03:46:14.460 --> 03:46:16.596
A 10% CUT IN ALL. STATE

03:46:16.663 --> 03:46:19.098
EMPLOYEES SALARIES IN ACROSS

03:46:19.165 --> 03:46:20.600
THE BOARD AND I'LL SEE IF F. IN

03:46:20.667 --> 03:46:23.970
ALL OF THE RELATED. THE 10% IS

03:46:24.037 --> 03:46:26.306
CONSISTENT AND IT.

03:46:26.372 --> 03:46:27.206
UNFORTUNATELY FAIRLY

03:46:27.273 --> 03:46:29.108
DISTRIBUTED SO I DON'T KNOW

03:46:29.175 --> 03:46:29.742
THAT YOU COULD SAY IT'S A

03:46:29.809 --> 03:46:32.645
PRINCIPLE OR VALUE IS ABOUT.

03:46:32.712 --> 03:46:34.514
TRYING TO BE EQUAL AND- AT THE

03:46:34.580 --> 03:46:37.450
VERY EIGHT. YEAH THAT THE I

03:46:37.517 --> 03:46:39.118
MEAN THAT'S FAIR AND I THINK

03:46:39.185 --> 03:46:39.752
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW

03:46:39.819 --> 03:46:42.121
UNDERSTAND OR I AM NOT YOU KNOW

03:46:42.188 --> 03:46:43.423
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

03:46:43.489 --> 03:46:46.059
IS JUST A MATTER OF. THIRTY RAY

03:46:46.125 --> 03:46:46.960
IT SOUNDS IKE IT'S PARITY

03:46:47.026 --> 03:46:49.262
AMONG ALL INSTITUTIONS. NOW I

03:46:49.329 --> 03:46:50.596
DON'T PERSONALLY THINK ALL

03:46:50.663 --> 03:46:52.832
INSTITUTIONS ARE THE SAME- I

03:46:52.899 --> 03:46:53.733
THINK THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT

03:46:53.800 --> 03:46:54.834
RESOURCES AND HAVE

03:46:54.901 --> 03:46:56.703
TRADITIONALLY BEEN FUNDED-

03:46:56.769 --> 03:46:58.237
INDIFFERENTLY. CAN'T FIGURE IF

03:46:58.304 --> 03:46:59.672
I LIKE THE SMITHS OR NOT- IT

03:46:59.739 --> 03:47:01.374
DIFFERENT LEVELS ARE NOT BUT

03:47:01.441 --> 03:47:04.644
AND- I. YOU KNOW AND CHILD CARE

03:47:04.711 --> 03:47:06.612
JUST ONE THAT. IF I HAD TO

03:47:06.679 --> 03:47:08.047
THINK OF PARITY IN EQUITY I'M

03:47:08.114 --> 03:47:09.882
NOT SURE HAS EVER BEEN FOR YOU

03:47:09.949 --> 03:47:11.884
KNOW. FUNDED IN IN A WAY THAT'S

03:47:11.951 --> 03:47:13.553
NEEDED SO IT FEELS LIKE A 10%

03:47:13.619 --> 03:47:15.154
HURTS IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT I

03:47:15.221 --> 03:47:17.256
APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND. AND

03:47:17.323 --> 03:47:18.358
RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THIS

03:47:18.424 --> 03:47:22.362
ISN'T MEANT TO KIND OF HEY US

03:47:22.428 --> 03:47:23.329
AGAINST EACH OTHER IT'S JUST

03:47:23.396 --> 03:47:24.497
REALLY TO UNDERSTAND AND ASK

03:47:24.564 --> 03:47:25.631
THE HARD QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE

03:47:25.698 --> 03:47:26.899
TRYING TO. WRAP OUR HEADS

03:47:26.966 --> 03:47:28.835
AROUND BEFORE WE VOTE ON A

03:47:28.901 --> 03:47:33.006
FINAL BUDGET- SO. WE HELD

03:47:33.072 --> 03:47:34.607
HARMLESS AT YOU KNOW FOR

03:47:34.674 --> 03:47:35.441
SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL BASED

03:47:35.508 --> 03:47:38.244

THIRTIETH WHAT HAPPENS AFTER.

03:47:43.750 --> 03:47:45.818
SO ONCE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER OF

03:47:45.885 --> 03:47:48.721
AND IT WOULD GO IT WOULD BE- A

03:47:48.788 --> 03:47:51.057
GO BACK TO THE NORMAL SO IF-

03:47:51.124 --> 03:47:52.492

THE ANSWERS I THIS IS A

03:48:55.254 --> 03:48:56.622
DIFFICULT CONVERSATION I FEEL

03:48:56.689 --> 03:48:58.324
LIKE ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS

03:48:58.391 --> 03:49:00.359
HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT- IT AT AND

03:49:00.426 --> 03:49:02.195
LIKE I SAID I THINK THAT I KNOW

03:49:02.261 --> 03:49:03.329
THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS BEEN AT

03:49:03.396 --> 03:49:04.464
THIS A DEBT. DECK IT FOR

03:49:04.530 --> 03:49:06.165
DECADES AND SO IT'S IT JUST.

03:49:06.232 --> 03:49:07.300
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S WE'RE

03:49:07.366 --> 03:49:09.602
REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT- AS OUR

03:49:09.669 --> 03:49:11.871
I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HERE- AND

03:49:11.938 --> 03:49:13.106
I A YOU KNOW I WANT TO ECHO

03:49:13.172 --> 03:49:15.508
WHAT'S BEEN SAID. BY THE CHAIR

03:49:15.575 --> 03:49:18.344
AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF

03:49:18.411 --> 03:49:20.213
WE CAN COME UP. IN THE SAME WAY

03:49:20.279 --> 03:49:21.147
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE

03:49:21.214 --> 03:49:23.749
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION- FOR K.

03:49:23.816 --> 03:49:24.717
TWELVE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH A

03:49:24.784 --> 03:49:27.286
PLAN B. OR C. BUT- I THINK THAT

03:49:27.353 --> 03:49:28.521
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR I

03:49:28.588 --> 03:49:30.790
THINK THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

03:49:30.857 --> 03:49:32.358
AS WELL AS A LAWMAKER JUST AYE

03:49:32.425 --> 03:49:34.327
I CAN'T LOSE HOPE RIGHT NOW

03:49:34.393 --> 03:49:35.528
THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY

03:49:35.595 --> 03:49:38.197
FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT. WE COULD

03:49:38.264 --> 03:49:38.865
KEEP SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS

03:49:38.931 --> 03:49:40.600
OPEN AND NOT LOSE THEM

03:49:40.666 --> 03:49:42.368
PERMANENTLY SO I THINK THAT ANY

03:49:42.435 --> 03:49:44.403
COMMENTS OR PASSION. THAT COMES

03:49:44.470 --> 03:49:46.973
OUT OF IT IS REALLY LOOKING AT

03:49:47.039 --> 03:49:49.008
IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE- IT'S

03:49:49.075 --> 03:49:51.177
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR USAND- TO

03:49:51.244 --> 03:49:52.745
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN

03:49:52.812 --> 03:49:54.680
DO BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA HURT

03:49:54.747 --> 03:49:57.650
EVERYONE. WE'RE JUST NOT BE

03:49:57.717 --> 03:49:59.051
SUMMIT WRITERS BE ABLE TO. READ

03:49:59.118 --> 03:50:00.119
AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE OUR

03:50:00.186 --> 03:50:03.256
STATES. UP PROBLEM HARDER AND-

03:50:03.322 --> 03:50:04.524
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I

03:50:04.590 --> 03:50:06.058
ASKED RELATED TO AFTER SCHOOL

03:50:06.125 --> 03:50:07.660
PROGRAMS IN THE PREVIOUS.

03:50:07.727 --> 03:50:09.529
CONVERSATION WAS WHAT DO WE

03:50:09.595 --> 03:50:12.598
DEAL WITH ALL THESE KIDS. AND I

03:50:12.665 --> 03:50:13.499
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO WITH ALL

03:50:13.566 --> 03:50:14.867
THESE KIDS IF THEY'RE NOT IN

03:50:14.934 --> 03:50:16.202
CHILD CARE IF THEY DON'T HAVE

03:50:16.269 --> 03:50:18.538
ACCESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT-

03:50:18.604 --> 03:50:21.140
HAPPENS. OF BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE

03:50:21.207 --> 03:50:22.808
SEEN IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER

03:50:22.875 --> 03:50:24.377
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED

03:50:24.443 --> 03:50:26.212
CHILDCARE. AND THEY'VE HAD TO

03:50:26.279 --> 03:50:28.014
MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT

03:50:28.080 --> 03:50:29.482
WHAT TYPES OF JOBS THEY TAKE

03:50:29.549 --> 03:50:30.816
WHETHER THEY CAN TAKE A JOB OR

03:50:30.883 --> 03:50:33.186
NOT- AND THAT CERTAINLY. HAS AN

03:50:33.252 --> 03:50:35.121
IMPACT TO OUR ECONOMY SO. I

03:50:35.188 --> 03:50:37.023
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION.

03:50:37.089 --> 03:50:40.126

THE THINGS THAT I HAVE SAID IS

03:51:02.014 --> 03:51:03.583
WE DO NEED TO PART OF THAT IS

03:51:03.649 --> 03:51:06.018
RE OPENING SCHOOLS AND- ALL OF

03:51:06.085 --> 03:51:08.187
THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE IS

03:51:08.254 --> 03:51:08.688
INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S

03:51:08.754 --> 03:51:11.290
FRAMEWORK. SAY THAT SCHOOLS CAN

03:51:11.357 --> 03:51:15.494
RE OPEN IN THE FALL- NEO. MORE

03:51:15.561 --> 03:51:17.029
BOLD NEED DIFFERENT SAFETY

03:51:17.096 --> 03:51:17.930
PROTOCOLS THOSE ARE BEING

03:51:17.997 --> 03:51:20.566
WORKED ON- BUT THEY UNDER EVEN

03:51:20.633 --> 03:51:21.968
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S FRAME WORK

03:51:22.034 --> 03:51:23.769
THEY CAN RE OPEN IN THE FALL SO

03:51:23.836 --> 03:51:25.438
THAT WILL DO A WHOLE LOT.

03:51:25.504 --> 03:51:27.106
HELPING ENSURE THAT KIDS ARE IN

03:51:27.173 --> 03:51:29.609
SCHOOL PARENTS CAN WORK OKAY.

03:51:29.675 --> 03:51:31.510
THE OTHER KEY COMPONENT THOUGH

03:51:31.577 --> 03:51:35.815
HERE IS CHILD CARE. AND

03:51:35.881 --> 03:51:37.116
CERTAINLY THAT'S THE OTHER BIG

03:51:37.183 --> 03:51:38.317
COMPONENT HERE THAT IN ORDER

03:51:38.384 --> 03:51:39.685
FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GO

03:51:39.752 --> 03:51:43.422
BACK TO WORK- SAFELY REOPEN. WE

03:51:43.489 --> 03:51:46.492
NEED CHILDCARE. AND THIS IS AN

03:51:46.559 --> 03:51:48.461
AREA WHERE ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL

03:51:48.527 --> 03:51:50.429
GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN

03:51:50.496 --> 03:51:52.498
EXTREMELY HELPFUL. AS I LIKE TO

03:51:52.565 --> 03:51:53.833
POINT OUT THE GOVERNOR THE

03:51:53.899 --> 03:51:54.734
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY

03:51:54.800 --> 03:51:56.269
PROVIDED TWO TRILLION DOLLARS

03:51:56.335 --> 03:51:58.638
WORTH OF RELIEF THAT IS GONNA

03:51:58.704 --> 03:52:00.673
BUSINESSES THAT HAS GONE TO

03:52:00.740 --> 03:52:02.875
CHILD CARE. TO HELP AND SUPPORT

03:52:02.942 --> 03:52:03.643
US AND THIS IS WHERE THE

03:52:03.709 --> 03:52:05.911
GOVERNOR'S STRATEGY AND

03:52:05.978 --> 03:52:09.215
ARGUMENT THIS DOES NOT LINE UP.

03:52:09.282 --> 03:52:11.150
BECAUSE IN FACT AND YOU GUYS

03:52:11.217 --> 03:52:12.218
ARE RELYING ON IT YOU'RE

03:52:12.285 --> 03:52:14.020
RELYING ON FEDERAL MONEY THAT

03:52:14.086 --> 03:52:15.454
HAS COME THROUGH HUNDRED FIFTY

03:52:15.521 --> 03:52:18.057
TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR CODE

03:52:18.124 --> 03:52:19.058
NINETEEN EXPENSES INCLUDING

03:52:19.125 --> 03:52:20.826
TEMPORARY EMERGENCY VOUCHERS

03:52:20.893 --> 03:52:22.395
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

03:52:22.461 --> 03:52:24.964
CLEANING SUPPLIES AND SERVICES.

03:52:25.031 --> 03:52:28.401
AND SUSPENDING FAMILY FEES.

03:52:28.467 --> 03:52:29.035
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR

03:52:29.101 --> 03:52:30.836
SUBSIDIZE FIRST PER STIPENDS TO

03:52:30.903 --> 03:52:34.707
ALL SUBSIDIZE. PROVIDERS AND

03:52:34.774 --> 03:52:35.241
SEVENTY THREE MILLION TO

03:52:35.308 --> 03:52:38.010
SUPPORT AN ESTIMATED FIVE

03:52:38.077 --> 03:52:38.444
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED

03:52:38.511 --> 03:52:39.979
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM

03:52:40.046 --> 03:52:41.847
SLOTS. SO THE FEDERAL

03:52:41.914 --> 03:52:43.683
GOVERNMENT HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY

03:52:43.749 --> 03:52:45.584
COME THROUGH TO HELP SUPPORT

03:52:45.651 --> 03:52:47.486
CHILD CARE AND YET AND THIS MAY

03:52:47.553 --> 03:52:49.889
REVISE YOUR PULLING BACK STATE

03:52:49.955 --> 03:52:52.325
MONEY. YOU'VE GOTTEN FEDERAL

03:52:52.391 --> 03:52:53.159
MONEY TO HELP SUPPORT THE

03:52:53.225 --> 03:52:54.460
SYSTEM THAT YOU ARE PULLING

03:52:54.527 --> 03:52:56.128
BACK STATE MONEY AND THEN

03:52:56.195 --> 03:52:57.229
YOU'RE SAYING WELL AND THOSE

03:52:57.296 --> 03:52:59.565
THOSE ARE GOING TO PLACE UNLESS

03:52:59.632 --> 03:53:00.132
THE FED'S GIVE US EVEN MORE

03:53:00.199 --> 03:53:02.501
MONEY. THE YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT

03:53:02.568 --> 03:53:03.736
BE AN ARGUMENT FOR OTHER PARTS

03:53:03.803 --> 03:53:05.104
OF THIS BUDGET SAYING HEY WE

03:53:05.171 --> 03:53:06.238
WANT TO RELY ON FEDERAL FUNDS

03:53:06.305 --> 03:53:07.740
AND IF THEY DON'T COME THROUGH.

03:53:07.807 --> 03:53:09.875
WE'RE GONNA TO MAKE BIGGER CUTS

03:53:09.942 --> 03:53:11.944
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

03:53:12.011 --> 03:53:13.212
IN THE CHILDCARE SECTOR WHERE

03:53:13.279 --> 03:53:15.348
WE ARE GETTING. MONEY AND YET

03:53:15.414 --> 03:53:16.749
THE STATE IS PULLING BACK OR AT

03:53:16.816 --> 03:53:18.284
LEAST THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE

03:53:18.351 --> 03:53:20.186
HIS PROPONENT PROPOSING A PULL.

03:53:20.252 --> 03:53:24.457
BACK ON STATE COMMITMENTS.

03:53:24.523 --> 03:53:25.658
SHOULD BE THE OPPOSITE WE'VE

03:53:25.725 --> 03:53:27.360
GOTTEN FEDERAL FUNDS LET'S TRY

03:53:27.426 --> 03:53:28.661
TO KEEP AS MUCH OF THAT STATE

03:53:28.728 --> 03:53:30.696
FUNDING THERE IS OSSIBLE. SO I

03:53:30.763 --> 03:53:31.997
MEAN YOU GUYS HAVE ANY RESPONSE

03:53:32.064 --> 03:53:33.766
THAT WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT IN

03:53:33.833 --> 03:53:36.369
THIS SITUATION. PULLING BACK

03:53:36.435 --> 03:53:38.037
STATE COMMITMENTS IN IF YOU'RE

03:53:38.104 --> 03:53:39.672
JUST DOING A 10% I GET THAT.

03:53:39.739 --> 03:53:40.973
YOU KNOW SOMETIME BUT THAT'S

03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:42.408
NOT A GOOD WAY TO BUDGET.

03:53:42.475 --> 03:53:44.777
WHAT'S A PRIORITY. THAT'S WHAT

03:53:44.844 --> 03:53:45.878
WE'RE GONNA TO DETERMINE GOING

03:53:45.945 --> 03:53:47.913
OUT TO MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS

03:53:47.980 --> 03:53:49.749
BECAUSE WE ARE IN SCARCE TIMES-

03:53:49.815 --> 03:53:51.550
AND THE MONEY IS NOT THERE FOR

03:53:51.617 --> 03:53:53.753
EVERYTHING. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY

03:53:53.819 --> 03:53:55.121
WE'RE GONNA CUT 10% ACROSS THE

03:53:55.187 --> 03:53:57.289
BOARD EVERYBODY. THAT'S AN

03:53:57.356 --> 03:53:58.724
OVERSIMPLIFICATION WE GOT A

03:53:58.791 --> 03:54:00.059
LOOK AT OKAY WELL WHAT ARE THE

03:54:00.126 --> 03:54:01.494
MOST FUNDAMENTAL PROGRAMS THAT

03:54:01.560 --> 03:54:03.996
WE NEED TO HAVE IN PLACE. TO

03:54:04.063 --> 03:54:05.998
HELP PEOPLE THIS IS ONE OF THEM.

03:54:06.065 --> 03:54:07.833
SO I WE SHOULD JUST ESPECIALLY

03:54:07.900 --> 03:54:08.801
WHEN YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN

03:54:08.868 --> 03:54:10.636
FEDERAL FUNDS AND YOU'RE

03:54:10.703 --> 03:54:12.471
RELYING ON THEM IN YOUR BUDGET.

03:54:12.538 --> 03:54:13.806
TO HELP KEEP THINGS STABLE WHY

03:54:13.873 --> 03:54:15.241
ARE YOU DOING A 10% CUT IF

03:54:15.307 --> 03:54:16.876
ANYTHING WE SHOULD TRY TO KEEP

03:54:16.942 --> 03:54:18.544
AS MUCH STATE FUNDS IN THERE AS

03:54:18.611 --> 03:54:20.446
POSSIBLE ANY RESPONSE FROM

03:54:20.513 --> 03:54:23.616
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AGAIN AS

03:54:23.682 --> 03:54:25.851
I MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S ABOUT.

03:54:25.918 --> 03:54:27.520
BALANCING AND PROVIDING A

03:54:27.586 --> 03:54:29.455
FISCALLY STABLE AND BALANCED

03:54:29.522 --> 03:54:31.490
BUDGET. AND THOSE WERE. VERY

03:54:31.557 --> 03:54:33.058
VERY DIFFICULT IN OUR CHOICES

03:54:33.125 --> 03:54:36.395
AS I. AS I KNOW YOU. YOU

03:54:36.462 --> 03:54:41.467
RECOGNIZE THAT. YEAH BUT IT

03:54:41.534 --> 03:54:43.169
SOUNDS LIKE YOU JUST DID A

03:54:43.235 --> 03:54:45.871
SIMPLE 10% ACROSS THE BOARD CUT

03:54:45.938 --> 03:54:47.640
IN EACH YEAR. YOU'RE LEAVING A

03:54:47.706 --> 03:54:48.874
LOT OF THE TOUGH DECISIONS TO

03:54:48.941 --> 03:54:52.111
US WHICH IS FINE HAT'S HOW WE

03:54:52.178 --> 03:54:53.779
GOT INTO THIS WORK- I DON'T

03:54:53.846 --> 03:54:55.080
KNOW THAT IT WAS A SIMPLE 10%

03:54:55.147 --> 03:54:57.650
CUT IF I MAY UM. IT WAS REALLY

03:54:57.716 --> 03:54:59.685
A MATTER OF MULTIPLE AND

03:54:59.752 --> 03:55:01.120
LAYERED CUTS BECAUSE THE

03:55:01.187 --> 03:55:03.823
PROBLEM WAS SO SEVERE THAT WE

03:55:03.889 --> 03:55:04.957
DID A LITTLE BIT AND WE HAD TO

03:55:05.024 --> 03:55:06.358
GO BACK AND IT WASN'T ENOUGH

03:55:06.425 --> 03:55:07.793
AND WE HAD TO DO SO. IT WAS A

03:55:07.860 --> 03:55:10.696
CONTINUAL AND A LONG PROCESS

03:55:10.763 --> 03:55:11.997
AND THESE CUTS ARE VERY VERY

03:55:12.064 --> 03:55:15.167
DIFFICULT THE ADMINISTRATION-

03:55:15.234 --> 03:55:18.337
IT THIS IS NOT EASY FOR ANYONE

03:55:18.404 --> 03:55:21.140
SET. UP NOW WHAT. ARE YOU IN

03:55:21.207 --> 03:55:23.976
THIS. ANOTHER NOT EASY

03:55:24.043 --> 03:55:26.846
DECISIONS FOR ANYBODY- BUT ID

03:55:26.912 --> 03:55:28.414
THERE WAS A REFERENCE EARLIER

03:55:28.481 --> 03:55:29.548
TO HEY WE TRIED TO MAKE IT

03:55:29.615 --> 03:55:31.250
EQUITABLE ACROSS THE BOARD WITH

03:55:31.317 --> 03:55:34.086
10% CUTS OF ACROSS DIFFERENT

03:55:34.153 --> 03:55:36.889
APARTMENTS. AND I KNOW THESE

03:55:36.956 --> 03:55:38.390
ARE EASY DECISIONS BUT THIS IS

03:55:38.457 --> 03:55:39.992
THIS ESPECIALLY ONE AREA WHERE

03:55:40.059 --> 03:55:42.695
YOU WOULD THINK. WE COULD FIND

03:55:42.761 --> 03:55:44.830
A WAY TO KEEP. THE MONEY IN THE

03:55:44.897 --> 03:55:46.799
SYSTEM IN A SPECIAL WE NEED

03:55:46.866 --> 03:55:47.366
WE'RE GONNA NEED THESE MORE

03:55:47.433 --> 03:55:49.835
THAN EVER- HAVING SUB TO THE

03:55:49.902 --> 03:55:52.238
AND YOU'RE CUTTING RATES AT A

03:55:52.304 --> 03:55:52.872
TIME WHEN WE NEED TO KEEP RATES

03:55:52.938 --> 03:55:55.441
STABLE. THAT NOBODY DISAGREES

03:55:55.508 --> 03:55:57.543
WITH. THE STATE HOME WATER AND

03:55:57.610 --> 03:55:59.612
THE NEED TO DO THAT. TO FLATTEN

03:55:59.678 --> 03:56:02.815
THE CURVE- BUT THE SIDE EFFECT

03:56:02.882 --> 03:56:05.217
OF THAT HAS BEEN. THAT MANY OF

03:56:05.284 --> 03:56:06.151
THESE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN

03:56:06.218 --> 03:56:08.020
COMPLETELY CRIPPLED AND CHILD

03:56:08.087 --> 03:56:09.722
CARE PROVIDERS ARE ARE ARE NO

03:56:09.788 --> 03:56:11.724
DIFFERENT THEY HAD TO THEY HAD

03:56:11.790 --> 03:56:13.092
TO OPERATE UNDER VERY LIMITED

03:56:13.158 --> 03:56:15.928
CIRCUMSTANCES OF FOR A WHILE

03:56:15.995 --> 03:56:16.428
COULD ONLY PROVIDE TO A

03:56:16.495 --> 03:56:19.765
SENSUAL- WORKERS- SO THEY

03:56:19.832 --> 03:56:21.967
DIDN'T HAVE THE NUMBERS. TO

03:56:22.034 --> 03:56:23.669
MAKE A PROFITABLE VIABLE

03:56:23.736 --> 03:56:25.671
BUSINESS- AND THEN THEY HAVE

03:56:25.738 --> 03:56:26.572
ALL THESE OTHER CONSTRAINTS

03:56:26.639 --> 03:56:28.474
BEING PUT UPON THEM SO ALL YOUR

03:56:28.541 --> 03:56:30.342
YOUR INCREASING THEIR COSTS AND

03:56:30.409 --> 03:56:32.678
CUTTING THEIR REVENUE. AND NOW

03:56:32.745 --> 03:56:34.647
WE'RE SAYING OKAY BUT OPEN BACK

03:56:34.713 --> 03:56:35.180
UP AGAIN AND PROVIDE THIS

03:56:35.247 --> 03:56:37.116
SERVICE- BUT WE'RE GONNA CUT

03:56:37.182 --> 03:56:39.652
THE OF THIS. THE RATES THAT WE

03:56:39.718 --> 03:56:43.389
PAY YOU. AND THAT MAKES NO

03:56:43.455 --> 03:56:43.923
SENSE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE

03:56:43.989 --> 03:56:46.859
PLANNING KEEP. AND THAT AND I'M

03:56:46.926 --> 03:56:47.826
OTHER BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN

03:56:47.893 --> 03:56:49.595
SEVERELY IMPACTED THAT IS WHY

03:56:49.662 --> 03:56:50.629
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REOPEN

03:56:50.696 --> 03:56:54.366
SAFELY. AND REALLY BEGIN THAT

03:56:54.433 --> 03:56:55.834
PROCESS AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT

03:56:55.901 --> 03:56:57.736
IS ACTUALLY VIABLE. FOR

03:56:57.803 --> 03:56:58.671
BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO

03:56:58.737 --> 03:57:00.072
OPERATE CHILD CARE BEING THE

03:57:00.139 --> 03:57:01.907
ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. RIGHT

03:57:01.974 --> 03:57:05.277
NOW LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION I

03:57:05.344 --> 03:57:07.546
MEAN LA- HAS RECOMMENDED THAT

03:57:07.613 --> 03:57:09.181
THE LEGISLATURE MAYBE MAKE

03:57:09.248 --> 03:57:10.549
REDUCTIONS BASED ON A

03:57:10.616 --> 03:57:12.117
PERCENTILE OF THE REGIONAL

03:57:12.184 --> 03:57:15.487
MARKET RATE WHICH- MIGHT BE A

03:57:15.554 --> 03:57:17.156
FAIR WAY TO ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS

03:57:17.222 --> 03:57:19.825
TO THE PRIVATE MARKET- ACROSS

03:57:19.892 --> 03:57:21.493
THE STATE IS THAT. SOMETHING

03:57:21.560 --> 03:57:23.228
YOU GUYS OF LOOK THAT YOU GUYS

03:57:23.295 --> 03:57:25.931
HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. IT IS

03:57:25.998 --> 03:57:28.000
NOT PART OF OUR PROPOSAL THAT

03:57:28.067 --> 03:57:30.102
WE WOULD CERTAINLY. SESSIONS

03:57:30.169 --> 03:57:38.477
WITH THE LA. WELL LOOK I JUST I

03:57:38.544 --> 03:57:40.045
THINK MY POINT IS IT I THINK

03:57:40.112 --> 03:57:41.046
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE CAN

03:57:41.113 --> 03:57:43.415
KEEP STATE MONEY INTO THIS

03:57:43.482 --> 03:57:44.049
PROGRAM WE ALREADY HAVE FEDERAL

03:57:44.116 --> 03:57:46.719
MONEY WE DON'T KNOW WE HAVE NO

03:57:46.785 --> 03:57:47.920
CONTROL AS YOU SAID BEFORE WE

03:57:47.987 --> 03:57:49.922
HAVE NO CONTROL OF A WHAT- THE

03:57:49.989 --> 03:57:51.156
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENDS UP

03:57:51.223 --> 03:57:52.391
DOING WITHIN. WITH ADDITIONAL

03:57:52.458 --> 03:57:54.560
STIMULUS OVER AND ABOVE THE TWO

03:57:54.627 --> 03:57:55.127
TRILLION IT'S ALREADY BEEN

03:57:55.194 --> 03:57:57.496
GIVEN. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

03:57:57.563 --> 03:57:59.999
CONTROL OVER THAT I THINK WE'RE

03:58:00.065 --> 03:58:01.367
ALL HOPEFUL THAT THERE WILL BE

03:58:01.433 --> 03:58:02.968
ADDITIONAL FUNDING COMING IN.

03:58:03.035 --> 03:58:04.737
BUT HERE'S INNER WE'VE ALREADY

03:58:04.803 --> 03:58:06.505
GOTTEN FUNDING SO WE SHOULD BE

03:58:06.572 --> 03:58:07.806
ABLE TO KEEP STATE FUNDING AS

03:58:07.873 --> 03:58:09.942
STABLE AS POSSIBLE. AND I WOULD

03:58:10.009 --> 03:58:11.243
CERTAINLY BE A PROPONENT OF

03:58:11.310 --> 03:58:12.378
THAT AND THE LAST THING I THINK

03:58:12.444 --> 03:58:13.278
WE NEED TO DO ESPECIALLY THE

03:58:13.345 --> 03:58:15.581
CHILD CARE SECTOR RIGHT NOW. IS

03:58:15.648 --> 03:58:17.816
BE CUTTING RATES. ARBITRARILY

03:58:17.883 --> 03:58:19.518
ACROSS THE BOARD. AT THE VERY

03:58:19.585 --> 03:58:20.319
LEAST MAYBE WE SHOULD BE

03:58:20.386 --> 03:58:21.687
LOOKING AT THIS ON THE ON THE

03:58:21.754 --> 03:58:23.922
REGIONAL BASIS. AND A AND

03:58:23.989 --> 03:58:24.556
HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO DO

03:58:24.623 --> 03:58:28.460
THAT. AT ALL SO THAT'S A- THOSE

03:58:28.527 --> 03:58:35.134
ARE MY TWO CENTS. BUT. OKAY

03:58:35.200 --> 03:58:35.701
THANK YOU A MISTER GALLAGHER

03:58:35.768 --> 03:58:37.736
THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE GREAT

03:58:37.803 --> 03:58:39.505
QUESTIONS GREAT COMMENTARY THAT

03:58:39.571 --> 03:58:40.472
TO SHOW THAT THIS IS A

03:58:40.539 --> 03:58:42.207
BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND- AND I

03:58:42.274 --> 03:58:43.709
APPRECIATE YOU IF YOU ENGAGE IN

03:58:43.776 --> 03:58:45.444
HERE JUST A COUPLE FOLLOW UP-

03:58:45.511 --> 03:58:47.179
PIECES FROM THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE

03:58:47.246 --> 03:58:48.914
GONNA TALK TOMORROW ABOUT UC

03:58:48.981 --> 03:58:52.117
AND CSU AND- I CONCUR THAT

03:58:52.184 --> 03:58:53.485
THERE'S PAIN ACROSS THE ENTIRE

03:58:53.552 --> 03:58:56.355
BUDGET. BUT THAT 10% IS AN

03:58:56.422 --> 03:58:58.223
APPLES TO APPLES AND AS AS

03:58:58.290 --> 03:58:59.925
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMóN SAID IN

03:58:59.992 --> 03:59:00.726
SOME AREAS AS A BIGGER

03:59:00.793 --> 03:59:02.594
CONSEQUENCE YOU COULD ARGUE

03:59:02.661 --> 03:59:06.165
THAT IT UC AND CSU LAST YEAR WE

03:59:06.231 --> 03:59:06.732
HAD BIG AUDITS ON THEM THAT

03:59:06.799 --> 03:59:07.533
THEY HAD THESE. RESERVE

03:59:07.599 --> 03:59:10.202
ACCOUNTS AND- SO CALLED SLUSH

03:59:10.269 --> 03:59:11.670
FUNDS AND SO THE CUTS FOR

03:59:11.737 --> 03:59:14.640
THOSE- UC AND CSU ARE ROUGHLY

03:59:14.707 --> 03:59:15.240
BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE HUNDRED

03:59:15.307 --> 03:59:17.676
MILLION. MAYBE THEY CAN WEATHER

03:59:17.743 --> 03:59:19.678
THE STORM FOR A YEAR OR TWO-

03:59:19.745 --> 03:59:21.080
THEY CERTAINLY SOMETIMES OF THE

03:59:21.146 --> 03:59:22.214
UC ESPECIALLY HAVE PRIVATE

03:59:22.281 --> 03:59:23.649
PHILANTHROPY THAT COULD COME IN

03:59:23.716 --> 03:59:25.117
AND FILL THE GAP. THEY COULD

03:59:25.184 --> 03:59:26.819
YOU KNOW DO PAINFUL STUFF LIKE

03:59:26.885 --> 03:59:28.320
INCREASE STUDENT FEES THERE ARE

03:59:28.387 --> 03:59:30.389
OTHER WAYS TO BALANCE IT OUT

03:59:30.456 --> 03:59:31.957
THEY CAN ROLL MORE

03:59:32.024 --> 03:59:33.926
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AT UC.

03:59:33.992 --> 03:59:36.628
BUT WITH THESE CUTS IN FRANKLY

03:59:36.695 --> 03:59:38.797
CHILD CARE IT'S NOT JUST 10%

03:59:38.864 --> 03:59:41.066
IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE SELECT

03:59:41.133 --> 03:59:43.602
THE IT'S A REAL CONSEQUENCES SO

03:59:43.669 --> 03:59:45.270
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT. WE'RE

03:59:45.337 --> 03:59:46.238
NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST

03:59:46.305 --> 03:59:48.173
TAKE IT AS IT IS IT- IT'S 10%

03:59:48.240 --> 03:59:50.509
ACROSS THE BOARD BANG FOR STATE

03:59:50.576 --> 03:59:52.311
WORKERS AND UC AND CSU AND-

03:59:52.377 --> 03:59:54.747
HEALTHIER FACT BECAUSE IT'S NOT

03:59:54.813 --> 03:59:55.781
ALL THE SAME THERE THERE ARE

03:59:55.848 --> 03:59:57.649
DIFFERENT. VARIABLES WHICH WE

03:59:57.716 --> 03:59:59.885
REALLY NEED TO EVALUATE SO WE

03:59:59.952 --> 04:00:01.620
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT

04:00:01.687 --> 04:00:02.654
IN MIND BEFORE WE ADOPT OUR

04:00:02.721 --> 04:00:05.357
FINAL BUDGET SO- THAT'S NUMBER

04:00:05.424 --> 04:00:08.193
ONE. NUMBER TWO. I DO REALIZE

04:00:08.260 --> 04:00:09.828
THAT WE'RE MAKING. VERY

04:00:09.895 --> 04:00:11.830
DIFFICULT DECISIONS HERE WE

04:00:11.897 --> 04:00:12.831
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET BUT

04:00:12.898 --> 04:00:13.665
FOR EXAMPLE THE PRE SCHOOL

04:00:13.732 --> 04:00:14.900
EXPANSION YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

04:00:14.967 --> 04:00:17.136
ADVOCATE OF. PRESCHOOL FOR ALL

04:00:17.202 --> 04:00:18.403
IN CALIFORNIA AND THE

04:00:18.470 --> 04:00:19.037
GOVERNOR'S TALKED ABOUT

04:00:19.104 --> 04:00:20.539
UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND WE'RE

04:00:20.606 --> 04:00:22.141
PUTTING THAT EXPANSION ON HOLD

04:00:22.207 --> 04:00:25.043
AND SO. I CONCUR WE CAN'T

04:00:25.110 --> 04:00:26.879
NECESSARILY FOR THAT RIGHT NOW

04:00:26.945 --> 04:00:29.148
WE HAD- NOT JUST PRESCHOOL BUT

04:00:29.214 --> 04:00:30.749
FULL DAY PRESCHOOL LAST YEAR'S

04:00:30.816 --> 04:00:33.018
BUDGET SLOTS INCREASED- WHICH

04:00:33.085 --> 04:00:34.520
ESSENTIALLY AS CHILD CARE

04:00:34.586 --> 04:00:36.455
BECAUSE IT'S A FULL DAY- GRAND

04:00:36.522 --> 04:00:38.824
NOT THE SAME DAY- SOMETIMES AS

04:00:38.891 --> 04:00:40.325
THE CHILD CARE CENTERS. NONE

04:00:40.392 --> 04:00:41.326
THE LESS THOUGH IT SERVES

04:00:41.393 --> 04:00:43.095
FAMILIES WHEN THEY GO TO WORK-

04:00:43.162 --> 04:00:43.929
WERE PULLING BACK ON THAT

04:00:43.996 --> 04:00:45.697
EXPANSION AND I THINK THAT'S A

04:00:45.764 --> 04:00:47.966
SMART THING TO DO- BUT THOSE

04:00:48.033 --> 04:00:49.034
ARE AN EXISTING KIDS BEING

04:00:49.101 --> 04:00:50.502
SERVED- THERE'S BEEN SOME IN

04:00:50.569 --> 04:00:53.405
NEW FAMILIES AND SO. AGAIN TO

04:00:53.472 --> 04:00:55.274
CARE THAT HOUSE OP. TO REALLY

04:00:55.340 --> 04:00:56.642
UPSET THE APPLE CART UPSET THE

04:00:56.708 --> 04:00:58.076
APPLE CART OF THOUSANDS OF

04:00:58.143 --> 04:00:59.444
FAMILIES CURRENTLY BEING

04:00:59.511 --> 04:01:01.847
SERVED- SO WE NEED TO BE

04:01:01.914 --> 04:01:04.183
MINDFUL ABOUT THAT. WERE USING

04:01:04.249 --> 04:01:05.617
THE MONIES THAT WE HAD FOR THE

04:01:05.684 --> 04:01:06.785
PRE SCHOOL FACILITIES WERE

04:01:06.852 --> 04:01:08.754
SWEEPING HOUSAND PUTTING THOSE

04:01:08.821 --> 04:01:09.588
TO BALANCE THE BUDGET TO WHICH

04:01:09.655 --> 04:01:11.356
I THINK IT'S SMART TO- SO.

04:01:11.423 --> 04:01:12.524
AGAIN THERE ARE SOME THINGS

04:01:12.591 --> 04:01:13.692
THAT WERE KINDA GIVING ON BUT

04:01:13.759 --> 04:01:14.493
THIS ONE I THINK WE NEED TAKE A

04:01:14.560 --> 04:01:17.996
SECOND LOOK. I DO HAVE ANOTHER.

04:01:18.063 --> 04:01:19.498
QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:01:19.565 --> 04:01:21.500
FINANCE IN THE LA OKAY. ON THE

04:01:21.567 --> 04:01:24.403
FEDERAL MONIES- MISTER

04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:26.271
GALLAGHER TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE

04:01:26.338 --> 04:01:28.173
GOT THE FIRST. BIT OF MONEY IN

04:01:28.240 --> 04:01:30.242
THERE SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT WE

04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:31.376
SHOULDN'T TAKE A MAJOR HIT

04:01:31.443 --> 04:01:33.078
RIGHT HERE WE SHOULD. FRANKLY

04:01:33.145 --> 04:01:34.580
LOOK ABOUT POTENTIALLY GROWING

04:01:34.646 --> 04:01:35.948
WE DO. HAVE THE MONEY'S IN

04:01:36.014 --> 04:01:38.383
THERE FOR SERVING MORE IN THE

04:01:38.450 --> 04:01:41.086
SENSE A WORKER- AT THE SUCH A

04:01:41.153 --> 04:01:44.323
WORKER- CATEGORY- IF THERE IS

04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:45.691
AN- ADDITIONAL WAVE A FEDERAL

04:01:45.757 --> 04:01:47.326
MONEY- WOULD THERE BE

04:01:47.392 --> 04:01:48.961
OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ACCESS

04:01:49.027 --> 04:01:51.029
TO NOT. FOCUS ON JUST. YOU KNOW

04:01:51.096 --> 04:01:52.664
KEEPING EVEN BUT INCREASE

04:01:52.731 --> 04:01:55.000
ACCESS. RATHER FOR SLOTS FOR

04:01:55.067 --> 04:02:01.807
RATES. YEAH GOING TO TAKE THE

04:02:01.874 --> 04:02:05.310
QUESTION- I THINK PART OF THE-

04:02:05.377 --> 04:02:07.379
DETERMINATION WILL BE- WHAT

04:02:07.446 --> 04:02:08.680
KIND OF FUNDING THAT PROGRAM

04:02:08.747 --> 04:02:10.215
AND PROVIDE THEM WITH STRINGS

04:02:10.282 --> 04:02:11.116
ATTACHED TO THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE

04:02:11.183 --> 04:02:14.152
THE- THE CARE THAT. ARE HAD A

04:02:14.219 --> 04:02:15.654
DVD AUGMENTATION WHICH IS THE

04:02:15.721 --> 04:02:16.922
AUGMENTATION OF THINK WOULD IN

04:02:16.989 --> 04:02:18.323
THE MAYOR VISION DOES WALL ONE

04:02:18.390 --> 04:02:21.026
TIME AUGMENTATION BUT THEY WERE

04:02:21.093 --> 04:02:23.328
ARE RELATED TO THE OUTBREAK-

04:02:23.395 --> 04:02:25.130
THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

04:02:25.197 --> 04:02:26.198
PAY FOR EXAMPLE. INCREASE

04:02:26.265 --> 04:02:27.532
ACTIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE USING ONE

04:02:27.599 --> 04:02:29.801
TIME FUNDING- BUT TO DEFER BUT

04:02:29.868 --> 04:02:31.303
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS

04:02:31.370 --> 04:02:32.704
ABLE TO PROVIDE A- MORE

04:02:32.771 --> 04:02:33.739
FLEXIBLE FUNDING ABOUT

04:02:33.805 --> 04:02:38.944
SOMETHING THAT. BUT DEFINITELY.

04:02:39.011 --> 04:02:39.411
COULD BE PART OF THAT

04:02:39.478 --> 04:02:47.052
CONVERSATION. OKAY. I THINK- I

04:02:47.119 --> 04:02:50.422
THINK THAT'S IT FOR NOW. SO

04:02:50.489 --> 04:02:53.759
THIS AGAIN WAS. WE DID TALK

04:02:53.825 --> 04:02:55.427
ABOUT HE SAYS AGAIN RIGHT YEAH

04:02:55.494 --> 04:03:05.370
WE'RE GOOD WITH THAT. SO THE LA

04:03:05.437 --> 04:03:06.805
I JUST WANT TO CONCUR THAT THAT

04:03:06.872 --> 04:03:08.774
YOU DID RECOMMEND THAT WE DON'T

04:03:08.840 --> 04:03:12.144
DO THAT. CHEF FOR CHILD CARE TO

04:03:12.210 --> 04:03:15.914
DSS. YES THAT'S CORRECT YEAH WE

04:03:15.981 --> 04:03:17.215
ARE CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND

04:03:17.282 --> 04:03:19.685
REJECTING A PROPOSAL- AND WE

04:03:19.751 --> 04:03:21.286
HAD A WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS IN

04:03:21.353 --> 04:03:23.288
IN IN OUR OUR ORIGINAL HOUSE IS

04:03:23.355 --> 04:03:25.524
JUST ABOUT- YOU KNOW FOR

04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:26.959
EXAMPLE SPLITTING DID GENERAL

04:03:27.025 --> 04:03:29.027
TUCKER AT THE PRESCHOOL- AND

04:03:29.094 --> 04:03:30.929
ALSO JUST- THE RATIONALE FOR

04:03:30.996 --> 04:03:31.630
WHY THE CHANGE WE NEED TO

04:03:31.697 --> 04:03:33.265
OCCUR. WHEN WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

04:03:33.332 --> 04:03:35.734
THOSE CONCERNS- AND WE THINK

04:03:35.801 --> 04:03:36.802
THAT THE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN

04:03:36.868 --> 04:03:38.170
MODIFIED BUT THE ONGOING COSTS

04:03:38.236 --> 04:03:38.937
OF THE RIPPLES ARE STILL

04:03:39.004 --> 04:03:41.573
UNCLEAR OKAY- HERE MY FINAL TWO

04:03:41.640 --> 04:03:42.874
ISSUES THAT I FOUND MY NOTES

04:03:42.941 --> 04:03:45.143
HERE- THIS I WAS GONNA ASK CD

04:03:45.210 --> 04:03:47.279
INSERT NOVEL MORGAN. WHAT WHAT

04:03:47.346 --> 04:03:49.247
WERE YEAR WHAT WERE YOUR

04:03:49.314 --> 04:03:51.183
THOUGHTS ON THAT THE LAST TWO

04:03:51.249 --> 04:03:53.185
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LA- AND I

04:03:53.251 --> 04:03:56.421
GUESS IT'S PAGE TEN. THE READER

04:03:56.488 --> 04:03:58.357
ACT UP PROP SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS

04:03:58.423 --> 04:03:59.958
FROM EXPANSION TO RATE

04:04:00.025 --> 04:04:04.029
STABILIZATION. AND THEN. THIS

04:04:04.096 --> 04:04:11.236
IN KAMALA. THING. SHARES THEY

04:04:11.303 --> 04:04:13.271
WERE I JUST RECEIVED A PROPOSAL

04:04:13.338 --> 04:04:14.539
WHILE WE WERE IN THE HEARING SO

04:04:14.606 --> 04:04:15.874
I HAVEN'T HAD TIME WITH MY TEAM

04:04:15.941 --> 04:04:17.943
TO REALLY DIVE INTO IT BUT WE

04:04:18.010 --> 04:04:18.744
DO WANT TO MAKE OURSELVES

04:04:18.810 --> 04:04:21.346
AVAILABLE BOTH WITHOUT LEO THAT

04:04:21.413 --> 04:04:23.782
LEGISLATURE ANYA ADMINISTRATION

04:04:23.849 --> 04:04:26.284
TO DROP IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS

04:04:26.351 --> 04:04:28.653
TO ACHIEVE A REDUCTION ACROSS

04:04:28.720 --> 04:04:30.655
EARLY LEARNING CARE BEYOND THE

04:04:30.722 --> 04:04:33.125
10% RATE CUTS STILL LOOKING AT

04:04:33.191 --> 04:04:35.060
ANY OTHER OPPORTUNITY INCLUDING

04:04:35.127 --> 04:04:36.561
THERE'S THE FIFTY THREE MILLION

04:04:36.628 --> 04:04:38.697
THAT CAME AND AN ADDITIONAL CCF

04:04:38.764 --> 04:04:40.198
FINDS HOW COULD THAT BE USED

04:04:40.265 --> 04:04:41.333
FOR THE RATES THIS YEAR INSTEAD

04:04:41.400 --> 04:04:43.368
OF FURTHER EXPANSION. AND WE

04:04:43.435 --> 04:04:44.403
ALWAYS OF COURSE WANT TO

04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:45.604
SUPPORT EXPANSION WE KNOW WE

04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:46.772
HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT

04:04:46.838 --> 04:04:48.707
NEED ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZED EARLY

04:04:48.774 --> 04:04:50.208
LEARNING AND CARE BUT WE'RE

04:04:50.275 --> 04:04:52.044
REALLY WORRIED RIGHT NOW THAT

04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:53.812
ACCESS ACTUALLY ISN'T

04:04:53.879 --> 04:04:55.347
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN YOU'RE CUTTING

04:04:55.414 --> 04:04:57.649
THE RATES AS DRASTICALLY AS WE

04:04:57.716 --> 04:05:05.891
WOULD BE CUTTING THEM. OKAY AND

04:05:05.957 --> 04:05:08.760
THEN. LASTLY THIS IS BACK TO

04:05:08.827 --> 04:05:10.595
LA- SO THERE IS SOME CONFUSION

04:05:10.662 --> 04:05:13.598
WHEN WE- WHEN WE LEFT HERE IN

04:05:13.665 --> 04:05:14.966

WHO ARE OPEN- THAT THE OTHER

YET BUT WE HAVE HEARD FROM A

04:06:08.253 --> 04:06:10.589
FEW- FOLKS THAT THAT THEY THINK

04:06:10.655 --> 04:06:11.857

NOT GONE USED- NOW UNDER

04:06:15.560 --> 04:06:18.597

04:06:20.599 --> 04:06:22.167
WITH. BIG ONE IMPORTANT THING

04:06:22.234 --> 04:06:23.735
IN IN ADOPTING THE BUDGET IS

04:06:23.802 --> 04:06:24.503
TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW

04:06:24.569 --> 04:06:25.303

ADDITIONAL ONE TIME DOCTORS IS

04:06:46.024 --> 04:06:47.592
TO USE THE PERSPECTIVE. I GUESS

04:06:47.659 --> 04:06:49.394
