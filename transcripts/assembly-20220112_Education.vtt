01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:25.087
HUNGRY- IF CHAU. I WONDER

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:26.255
WHETHER THIS SYSTEM OUR BEST

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:28.023
APPROACH UNLESS SUPPOSED TO SO

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:31.894
THAT MEANS SO. THE PARENT COULD

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.030
GO HUNGRY AS WELL. R. ADULT A

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:37.165
MOTHER CAN COOK FOR HERSELF AND

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:40.068
NOT TO FEED THE CHILD AND THAT

01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:43.138
THE MOTHER. OR FATHER HAS TO

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.974
DRIVE THE CHILD. ONE YOU ALL

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.911
OVER TO THE SUPPOSED TO FOR YOU

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:49.978

KINDERGARTEN TO FLEE THE CHART

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.983
TO FREE THE CHILD AT SCHOOL. TO

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:57.920
ME THIS IS A VERY IMPRACTICAL

01:15:57.986 --> 01:16:00.923
WAY. RATHER THAN STRENGTHENING

01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:02.925
AND MAKING SURE EXISTING

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:05.093
PROGRAMS TO BE. IMPROVED OR

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.896
ENHANCED SUCH AS A KIND OF FRESH

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:13.869
WAR VETERAN- IT PROGRAM SO.

WANT TO REPLY TO YOU AND

01:16:19.975 --> 01:16:24.079
MULTIPLE VOICES. ONE AS A FELLOW

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:26.114
IMMIGRANT AS WELL BUT I'LL WAIT

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:28.083
FOR THAT ONE FIRST TO ANSWER

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:29.985
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT STUDIES

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:32.921
ABOUT. MALNUTRITION OR LACK OF

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:34.923
UP OF FOOD OPPORTUNITIES AND

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.892
FOOD AND SECURITY I DON'T I

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:38.193
THINK THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.062
HERE'S THIS ISSUE. MAYBE AD

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:42.230
NAUSEAM. YOU HEAR ABOUT THE

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:44.900
CHALLENGES AND THE NEEDS. OVER

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:46.301
40% OF OUR SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:48.971
SUFFERING FROM EITHER LACK OF

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:51.006
FOOD OR LACK OF ENOUGH FOOD

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:53.976
ACCESS TO FOOD AND SECURITY IS

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.978
AND I THINK I'M DOWNPLAYING BY

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.980
SAYING ONLY FORTY PERCENT. SO

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.881
IT'S A SIGNIFICANT NEED THAT WE

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.984
HAVE AND I WELCOME YOU SIR TO

OF THE SCHOOL DAY. WHERE SCHOOL

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:15.197
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN SESSION

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:17.065
BUT BECAUSE OF A LOCAL FIRE OR

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.968
BECAUSE OF SOME CIRCUMSTANCE ALL

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:21.069
SCHOOLS IN THE AREA WERE SHUT

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:24.039
DOWN. I WELCOME YOU TO SEE THE

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:26.208
LINES. THAT CONGREGATE OUTSIDE

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:28.076
OF EACH OF MY SCHOOLS. I DRIVE

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:30.212
AROUND IN THE MORNINGS I LOOK

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:33.015
FOR THESE THINGS I SEE IT- THERE

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:35.917
ARE LONG LINES BOTH INDIVIDUALS

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:37.919
STANDING AS WELL AS PEOPLE IN

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:39.921
THEIR CARS WAITING TO PICK UP

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:42.090
THAT THESE MEALS FOR THEIR KIDS.

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.893
AND I REPRESENT A RELATIVELY

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.928
AFFLUENT COMMUNITY BY THE WAY. I

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:47.963
COULD I REPRESENT THE

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.999
COMMUNITIES OF TO LOOK A LAKE

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:52.901
SHERMAN OAKS. VIDEO CITY VALLEY

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:55.070
VILLAGE I AND YOU CAN JUST SEE

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:56.905
IF THERE'S NEEDS IN COMMUNITIES

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:57.406
LIKE THIS WHERE THERE'S

01:17:57.472 --> 01:17:59.941
AFFLUENCE. WHAT THE NEW LOOK

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:02.010
WHAT THE NEED IS AND OTHER AREAS

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:04.079
OF THE STATE THAT DON'T HAVE

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:05.914
THESE AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES SO

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:08.016
THAT'S ONE. THERE'S A GREAT NEED

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:10.085
IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED IT'S AND

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:13.155
MANY OF YOUR- DISCUSSION ITEMS

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:15.991
THAT YOU HAVE ON IT ON A VERY

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.927
REGULAR BASIS TO. YOU KNOW I

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:21.963
DON'T. WHILE I WELL WE AL

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.265
BENEFIT FROM MANY EXPERTS COMING

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:26.001
AND SPEAKING TO US ABOUT BILL

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:27.903
IDEAS AND DIFFERENT NEEDS THAT

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:30.072
ARE THERE ARE ASIDE FROM OUR

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:31.940
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE NEEDS ARE

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:34.910
. I CONSTRUCTED THIS BILL ALSO

01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:37.913
BASED ON MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW OF

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:40.148
WHAT I SAW THE NEEDS TO BE. I'VE

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.217
HAD A BENEFIT GROWING UP IN AN

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:44.086
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY FAMILY MY

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:46.922
MOTHER WOULD. ALWAYS MAKE IT A

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:49.024
PRIORITY TO MAKE HOME COOKED

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:51.960
MEALS AND I HAD THE BENEFIT OF

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.895
GROWING UP. HAVING A BALANCED

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:55.964
DIET BETWEEN SOME ITEMS OF YOU

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.899
KNOW A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MEAT A

01:18:57.966 --> 01:18:59.901
LOT OF DIFFERENT VEGETABLES AND

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:02.070
A LOT OF FRUITS. I DON'T SEE

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:05.907
THAT UNFORTUNATELY THAT BALANCE

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:08.043
IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I DON'T I

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:11.012
AND NOW RAISING MY OWN THREE

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.014
KIDS I DON'T SEE MY WIFE AND I

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:14.116
HAVING THE LUXURY OF TIME TO

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:17.052
PREPARE MEALS EVERY TIME AND SO

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:19.020
WE NEED TO RELY ON. MEALS FROM

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:20.889
EITHER PURCHASING THEM FROM

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:22.057
OUTSIDE AND SO SOMETIMES IT GOES

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:23.992
AGAINST THE BALANCE THAT WE WANT

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:26.962
TO HALF ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT TO

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.897
MAKE IT AT A PRICE POINT THAT'S

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:29.998
AFFORDABLE. SO THERE'S MULTIPLE

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.166
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I'M TRYING

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:32.968
TO ADDRESS HERE WITH THIS ONE

01:19:33.034 --> 01:19:35.203
BILL. GATES IT GOES TO THE FACT

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.139
THAT MANY PARENTS ARE.

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:40.008
STRUGGLING IT GOES TO THE POINT

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.910
OF FOOD ALSO BEING COSTLY

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:43.879
ESPECIALLY WITH THE INFLATION

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:45.113
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DEALING WITH

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.982
OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:49.918
POTENTIAL FEW YEARS. AND GIVEN

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:51.987
ALSO HOW TO WHAT EXTENT WE SEE

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:54.156
HEALTH LONG TERM HEALTH IMPACTS

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:55.991
AND CONSEQUENCES BEING

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:57.893
ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT OUR

01:19:57.959 --> 01:20:00.996
CHILDREN EAT AT A YOUNG AGE IT'S

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:03.965
CRITICAL. IT'S CRITICAL AND SO

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:06.067
THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS A

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:09.905
VERY MODEST APPROACH. AT TAKING

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:12.908
ADVANTAGE OF ALSO THE BREAKFAST

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:14.075
PROGRAM FOR TOP FOUR FOUR

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:16.178
SIBLINGS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:18.213
WAS ESTABLISHED. UNDER THE TRUMP

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.882
ADMINISTRATION BY THE WAY JUST

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:23.919
SO YOU KNOW SIR. SO THIS IS SUCH

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.954
A VERY MODEST APPROACH OF TRYING

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.889
TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.891
FACETS OF THIS ISSUE THAT YOU'RE

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:32.961
DRESSING. SO I DO HOPE THAT YOU

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:34.896
CONSIDER SUPPORTING THIS OKAY

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:36.898

PERSON IT'S A CHILD OR DOG TO

DISTRIBUTION IN OUR- IS TO BE A

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:57.886
MATTER- WHAT I AM CONCERNED

01:20:57.953 --> 01:21:02.891
ABOUT IS THAT THE MECHANISM- THE

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:04.926
SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE AS I

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:07.195
MENTIONED. OF THERE MAY BE SOME

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:12.901
UP- BROKEN- WHICH IN THEIR- IF

WE CAN STRENGTHENING AND- I'LL

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:17.973
FIND OUT THE WAY TO MAKE IT TO

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.975
WORK ON MORE PERFECT WHAT IF-

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.910

UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT'S THAT THE

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:53.942
WITH THE COST OF THAT THEY CAN-

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:55.977

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:49.904
PROBABLY THE CHILDREN MAY NOT.

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:51.973
THE IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES OF

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:54.041
WOMAN TARA RETESTED RESEND YOU

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:56.911
OUT COMPOSING THIS BILL NO THIRD

01:31:56.978 --> 01:31:58.880
PARTY TO IDENTIFY AND TO DO

01:31:58.946 --> 01:32:02.984
SOMETHING ABOUT IT THE- AND-

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:06.220
WHEN I GREW UP. IN KOREA- WE HAD

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:09.023
A IN A TEACHER ASSIGNED TO THAT

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:11.959
THE WHOLE YEAR- HAD THE

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:15.029
PROGRAMMABLE VISITING- H. TIES

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:17.999
SO HOME- NOT FOR THESE PURPOSES

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:19.901
IN THE HOME THIS PURPOSE IS

01:32:19.967 --> 01:32:21.869
TOUGH BUT JUST TO. GET

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:23.871
ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOME BACK

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:26.007
FROM THE WHOLE OF THE TIME JUST

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:27.074
DOING ANY CONCERNS THAT THE

01:32:27.141 --> 01:32:29.043
PARENTS MAY RELATE ABOUT THE

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:31.946
CHILD TO THE TEACHER IN ORDER TO

01:32:32.013 --> 01:32:33.047
GET A PARENT TEACHER

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:34.982
RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. SO I

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:38.052
THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS A

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:40.888
PRETTY GOOD PROGRAM- I DON'T

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:41.923
KNOW THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE IN

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:44.892
THIS COUNTRY. TIME WISE OR

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.961
LEGALLY BUT- STUDENTS ARE

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:49.096
PRESENT AT SCHOOL WE ARE TRYING

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:51.032
TO FIND TABLE ALL HOME

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:53.901
BACKGROUND SO WHAT KIND OF

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:56.170
INDICATION SO- SHOULD RETRAIN

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:58.039
THE PERSON TO LOOK FOR. I THINK

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:00.007
THERE'S MULTIPLE WAYS I MEAN THE

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:02.977
FIRST THE FIRST STEP IN THIS

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:06.047
BILL WOULD BE THE- HOMELESS

01:33:06.113 --> 01:33:08.950
LIAISON WORKING WITH A STAFF FOR

01:33:09.016 --> 01:33:10.017
AN INDIVIDUAL TEACHER IF THEY

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:12.019
CHOOSE THAT TRAINING TO SHOW

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:14.188
THEM SOME- SIGNS THAT THEY MIGHT

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.223
LOOK FOR I MEAN IT REPETITIVE

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:18.960
ABSENCES. COMING TO- OUR

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:21.896
CLASSROOM MAYBE WITH NO SUPPLIES

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:24.865
COMING TO SCHOOL POSSIBLY WITH

01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:27.068
US SCHOOL UNIFORM NOT LAUNDERED

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:28.302
THINGS LIKE THAT THE COULD BE

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:30.905
SIGNS BUT IT'S ALL VERY

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:32.173
SENSITIVE AND PERSONAL BUT WE

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:34.041
ALSO KNOW. THE BEST WAY TO MAKE

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:36.877
CHANGE IS FROM PERSON TO PERSON

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:39.981
AND SO IF AN EDUCATOR HAS MORE

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:43.884
INFORMATION OF EITHER RED FLAGS

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.886
TO NOTICE QUESTIONS TO POSSIBLY

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:48.122
ASK WITHIN REASON I THINK THOSE

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:50.891
WERE BE THE BEST OUTCOME. AND

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.059
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT- THE STUDY

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:53.961
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES DON'T

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:57.064
ALWAYS SELF IDENTIFY. BUT IT'S

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.899
ALSO TAKING SOME OF THE STIGMA

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:01.902
AWAY FROM THIS ISSUE SO THAT

01:34:01.969 --> 01:34:05.072
THEY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE SELF

01:34:05.139 --> 01:34:10.945
IDENTIFYING- THAT THAT'S A ONE

01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:14.882
OUR APPROACH A HOWEVER WE DO OF

01:34:14.949 --> 01:34:17.118
SEE OUR PEOPLE LIVING ON THE

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:18.886
STREETS AND THE WITH THE

01:34:18.953 --> 01:34:21.856
CHILDREN AROUND WE NEED TO A

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:23.057
LOCKED UP QUICKER TO LIVE- THE

01:34:23.124 --> 01:34:24.458
TO IDENTIFY WHO THEY ARE WHICH

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:26.894
WAS THAT THEY GO TO YES AND ALSO

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:27.895
WORKING WITH COLLABORATIVE

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:29.997
PARTNERS WHETHER IT'S THE LOCAL

01:34:30.064 --> 01:34:31.999
POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE-

01:34:32.066 --> 01:34:34.902
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT ON THE

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:36.103
STREETS SOMETIMES ENGAGING THESE

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:38.139
FAMILIES THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:40.107
SEE THEM IN CARS WHERE THERE. I

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:42.076
MEAN I'LL JUST PERSONALLY SAY WE

01:34:42.143 --> 01:34:43.978
WALK AROUND OUR BLOCK WE SAW A

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:45.980
MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER ABOUT

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:48.015
SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:49.950
EVERY MORNING BRUSHING HER

01:34:50.017 --> 01:34:51.986
DAUGHTER'S CHAIR HAIR RIGHT OUT

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:54.055
OF THE SCHOOL AND SO MY THOUGHT

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:56.290
WAS KIND OF WHY ARE THEY THERE

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:59.060
SO EARLY- WHY IS SHE DOING SOME

01:34:59.126 --> 01:35:00.094
OF THESE BASIC THINGS YOU WOULD

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:03.097
DO AT HOME AND SO WE TALKED TO

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:04.198
THE PRINCIPAL AND THEY ACTUALLY

01:35:04.265 --> 01:35:06.967
WENT OUT AND- TALK TO THOSE THE

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:08.235
INDIVIDUALS AND THEY SAID NO

01:35:08.302 --> 01:35:10.004
THEY WEREN'T HOMELESS BUT THAT

01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:11.906
THEY HAD TO GET TO SCHOOL

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:13.974
EXTREMELY EARLY- BECAUSE THE

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:15.943
FATHER HAS A JOB AND HAD TO DROP

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:17.912
HIM OFF THAT EARLY AND SHE

01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:19.080
WANTED TO STAY WITH THEIR

01:35:19.146 --> 01:35:20.114
DAUGHTER. SO THAT'S JUST AN

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:21.949
EXAMPLE OF KIND OF WORKING IN

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:27.088
MULTIPLE AREAS TO TRY. TO DO THE

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:28.956
BEST WE CAN FOR THE FAMILIES.

DESIGN BUILD PILOT PROJECT FOR

THE JUDICIAL MASSIVE METHOD FOR

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:25.873
AWARDING CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.875
IS DESIGN BID BUILD. WHERE

01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:29.043
SCHOOL DISTRICT FIRST HIRES AN

01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:30.945
ARCHITECT TO DESIGN A SCHOOL AND

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:33.013
THEN GOES OUT TO BID FOR THE

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.082
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT KIND OF TO

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:36.951
SUIT TWO STEP PROCESS. UNDER

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:38.886
DESIGN BUILD A SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:41.155
SEEKS BIDS FOR BOTH THE DESIGN

01:37:41.222 --> 01:37:42.890
AND CONSTRUCTION. HAVING AN

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:43.958
ARCHITECTURE ARCHITECT AND

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:45.259
CONTRACTOR WORK TOGETHER FROM

01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:47.094
THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT IS

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:48.896
MORE EFFICIENT AND HELPS PREVENT

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:51.899
PROBLEMS LATER ON IN THE PROCESS

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:53.901
. WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHAT

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:54.969
THE PRIVATE SECTOR SCHOOL

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:56.036
DISTRICTS AND OTHER AGENCIES

01:37:56.103 --> 01:37:57.238
HAVE FOUND IS THAT SETTING UP

01:37:57.304 --> 01:37:59.840
PRICE FOR THE CONTRACT BEFORE A

01:37:59.907 --> 01:38:01.875
DESIGN HAS STARTED OR HAS BEEN

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:03.244
COMPLETED BECAUSE AS ONE OF TWO

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.879
PROBLEMS. EITHER THE SCHOOL

01:38:05.946 --> 01:38:07.081
DISTRICT OVER PAYS BECAUSE THE

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:09.016
CONSTRUCTION COST PROJECT BY THE

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:11.018
BIDDER IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE

01:38:11.085 --> 01:38:12.953
TRUE ACTUAL COST WHICH MAY BE A

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.955
FEW YEARS AFTER THE CONTRACT IS

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:18.325
AWARDED. FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:19.994
ENDS UP WITH A FACILITY THAT

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:21.929
USES LOWER QUALITY MATERIAL. FOR

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:25.933
THAT. ORD ORD. MATERIAL THAT DID

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.101
THAT DOESNOT MEET THE NEEDS OF

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:29.036
THE SCHOOL SUCH AS FEWER

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:30.070
CLASSROOMS BECAUSE A CONTRACT

01:38:30.137 --> 01:38:32.873
AMOUNT CANNOT BE CHANGED. AB

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.174
NINE OH TWO ALLOWS A LIMITED

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:35.876
NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:36.977
PARTICIPATE IN A PILOT. THAT

01:38:37.044 --> 01:38:38.312
ALLOWS A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO

01:38:38.379 --> 01:38:40.047
AWARD AN INITIAL BID THAT DOES

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.181
NOT INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:43.884
COSTS. AND INSTEAD ALLOWS A

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:44.885
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO RENEGOTIATE

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:47.888
WITH THE DESIGN BUILD TEAM ONCE

01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:49.089
THERE'S A DESIGN. LAST YEAR

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:50.858
THROUGH A BUDGET TRAILER BILL

01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:51.959
THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:53.060
GENERAL SERVICES RECEIVED

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:55.229
AUTHORITY TO USE PROGRESSIVE

01:38:55.296 --> 01:38:58.065
DESIGN BUILD. THIS BILL PROVIDES

01:38:58.132 --> 01:38:59.900
VERY SIMILAR TO VERY SIMILAR

01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:01.869
AUTHORIZATION TO DISTRICTS WITH

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:03.871
FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE ADA AND

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:05.005
FOR LARGER PROJECTS SO IT'S

01:39:05.072 --> 01:39:06.907
ABOUT ELEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:08.075
THE STATE MORE LOSS. THE JANUARY

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:09.977
THIRD VERSION OF THIS BILL WAS

01:39:10.044 --> 01:39:11.345
BASED ON SUGGESTIONS MADE BY THE

01:39:11.412 --> 01:39:13.213
OPPOSITION. I UNDERSTAND THEY

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.915
HAVE ADDITIONAL CONCERNS AND WE

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:15.983
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:17.885
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. THOUGH

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:19.253
SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS JUST CAME

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.988
ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE DAYS THIS

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:23.057
BILLS GOING TO PRINT FOR

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:24.124
SOMETIME. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.893
AMENDMENT TO FURTHER CLARIFY

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:27.127
THAT THE PROCESS FOR AWARDING

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:29.129

THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE

DESIGN BUILD TEAM. THIS BILL IS

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:37.071
SPONSORED BY THE LOS ANGELES%

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:38.872

THEIR PRICES TOO HIGH THEN THE

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:19.893
TEAM ITSELF FINDS WAYS TO LOWER

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.095
IT. OR THEY CAN PART WAYS WITH

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:23.931

AND THAT YOU OF LIMITED TO A

01:46:05.058 --> 01:46:07.961
CERTAIN NUMBER OF MY OWN. DID

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:09.229

YOU'RE MAKING A CHANGE LIKE THIS

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:17.104
AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:18.872
REPORT IT'S GOING TO COME OUT.

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:21.007
OF AND THAT THIS IS GOING TO

01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:23.043
SUNSET- SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:24.945
CAN REALLY LEARN ABOUT THIS NEW

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:25.979
PROCESS THE THAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.981
ABOUT- AND I THINK THAT. COULD

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:29.883
BE HELPFUL FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:31.918
IT MAY NOT BE WILL LOOK WE'LL

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.887
FIND OUT THAT'S WHAT THE PILOT

01:46:33.954 --> 01:46:34.955

MISTER GOVERNOR SPOKE ABOUT-

01:46:45.065 --> 01:46:46.867
ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT HE WAS

JUST LIKE CLARIFICATION MIGHT

01:46:51.204 --> 01:46:52.973
FROM MY STANDPOINT. THIS IDEA

01:46:53.039 --> 01:46:54.040
THAT THEY PICK THE

01:46:54.107 --> 01:46:55.842
SUBCONTRACTORS OR THAT THE

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:56.877

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:58.879
SUBCONTRACTORS IS IT YOUR

01:46:58.945 --> 01:47:01.081
INTENTION WAS TO BUILD TO TRY TO

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:02.082
SEE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SHOULD

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:04.885
PICK THE SUBCONTRACTORS. BECAUSE

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:06.953
YOU WANT THEM TO BE SKILLED AND

01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.055

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:11.892
REASON WHY YOU WANT THAT OR IS

01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:12.859
THAT AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION

01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:14.060

01:47:15.929 --> 01:47:17.063
REALLY THE OVERALL EFFORT IS A

01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:18.832
BILL TO ALLOW FOR DISTRICT

01:47:18.899 --> 01:47:21.134

01:47:21.201 --> 01:47:23.003
COSTS THE ULTIMATE COST OF A

01:47:23.069 --> 01:47:24.938
PROJECT BUT AGAIN MISTER

GOVERNOR HAS COME FOR AND

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:28.008
BROUGHT UP SOME VALID POINTS

01:47:28.074 --> 01:47:29.943
