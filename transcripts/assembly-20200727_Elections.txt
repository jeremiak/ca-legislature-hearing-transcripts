THE LA COUNTY NEVADA REGISTRATION COMMISSION WAS CREATED BY US BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. IT HAD THE GOAL OF PROVIDING A SIMILAR PUBLIC PROCESS AS WAS PROVIDED BY THE CITIZENS REDUCE OUR COMMISSION STATEWIDE. AND THIS INCLUDES THE SELECTION OF FOURTEEN COMMISSIONERS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE POLITICAL PARTY PREFERENCES OF THE COUNTY. BUT MP PEAS ARE NOT CONSIDERED A POLITICAL PARTY. ALTHOUGH THEY MAKE UP ONE POINT FOUR MILLION VOTERS OR OVER A QUARTER OF THE REGISTERED VOTERS IN LA COUNTY. SO THIS BILL- WILL FOR PHIL THE SPIRIT. OF THE ORIGINAL LAW- THAT THEY AND BASICALLY MAKE IT SO THAT WERE VERY CLEAR THAT ANTI P. VOTERS CAN BE INCLUDED AS COMMISSION MEMBERS BY CLEARLY STATING. THAT NO PARTY PREFERENCE CAN BE INCLUDED ON THE COMMISSION PROPORTIONAL TO VOTER REGISTRATIONS. IN THE COUNTY. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THE COMMISSION BE CREATED BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SO EMERGENCY CLAUSE.

SELECTION PROCESS AS YOU KNOW NOW WE HAVE THE CENSUS THIS YEAR AND- SO WILL BE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE DISTRICT LINES IN LA COUNTY JUST AS WE WILL BE. DOING STATEWIDE. THIS IS THAT- BILL THAT THAT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THE INDEPENDENT DISTRICT COMMISSION REPRESENTS THE POLITICAL DIVERSITY. OF LA COUNTY VOTERS AND ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FAIRNESS IT SHOULD REALLY BE JUST AS WE'VE DONE STATEWIDE WITH OUR REDISTRICTING. FIVE REPUBLICANS FIVE FIVE DEMOCRATS- ONE AND PP I THINK IS WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW. WE CAN DO SIMILARLY AT LEAST PROVIDE THAT SAME.

THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. FOR THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION IS LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED DAYS AWAY YEAH WE STILL DON'T KNOW WITH CERTAINTY HOW COVERT NINETEEN WILL BE AFFECTING US AT THAT TIME. DID AB EIGHT SIXTY EVERY REGISTERED VOTER IN CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THE MAIL. PROVIDING A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO VOTING IN PERSON BUT MANY CALIFORNIA VOTERS EITHER CAN. OR WILL CHOOSE NOT TO USE THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. FOR EXAMPLE MANY VOTERS WILL NEED TO USE ACCESSIBLE VOTING EQUIPMENT OR WHEN THE LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE. HOMELESS AND OTHER CALIFORNIA VOTERS. MAY NOT RECEIVE THEIR MAIL BALLOT. OTHERS WILL LOSE OR DAMAGE THEIR BALLOTS AND NEED REPLACEMENTS SOME VOTERS SIMPLY PREFER TO PLACE THE BALLOT IN THE BALLOT BOX THEMSELVES. IN ADDITION ELIGIBLE PEOPLE WILL NEED SOMEWHERE THEY CAN REGISTER TO VOTE. UP TO AND INCLUDING ELECTION DAY ITSELF. SB FOUR TWENTY THREE GUARANTEES THERE WILL BE ACCESSIBLE SECURE AND SAFE IN PERSON OPPORTUNITIES. FOR ALL THESE VOTERS FOR FOUR FULL DAYS STARTING THE SATURDAY PRIOR TO THE ELECTION. SB FOUR TWENTY THREE WILL ALSO REQUIRE NUMEROUS CONVENIENT LOCATIONS FOR VOTERS WHO WANT TO DROP OFF THEIR BALLOTS. AS WELL AS A STATEWIDE VOTER EDUCATION AN AVERAGE CAMPAIGN REGARDING PROCEDURES. KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE OPTIONAL FOR THE COUNTIES. THE COUNTY WOULD RATHER RUN THEIR ELECTION AS THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY WHETHER THEY ARE VOTERS CHOICE ACT OR TRADITIONAL POLLING PLACE COUNTY. THERE WILL STILL BE FREE TO DO SO. EITHER WAY THEY MUST STILL MAIL EVERY REGISTERED VOTER A BALLOT. SB FOUR TWENTY THREE WILL ENSURE AMPLE AND EARLY IN PERSON VOTING OPPORTUNITIES IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE. AND REQUIREMENTS WALK SIMULTANEOUSLY RECOGNIZING THAT COUNTIES MAY FACE COVERED NINETEEN RELATED CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING POLLING PLACES OR VOTE CENTERS. THE WAY THEY HAVE IN PRIOR ELECTIONS. WHETHER VCA OR NON VCA. PARTICIPATING COUNTIES WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE AT LEAST ONE VOTING LOCATION FOR EVERY TEN THOUSAND REGISTERED VOTERS. AND ONE DROP OFF LOCATION FOR EVERY FIFTEEN THOUSAND REGISTERED VOTERS. COUNTIES WISHING TO PARTICIPATE WHO MAKE A VALID EFFORT TO COMPLY WILL BE ABLE TO SEEK PARTIAL WAIVERS FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE. IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN 1100% OF THE REQUIRED VOTING SITES OR DROP OFF LOCATIONS. AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN AND SOME OTHER STATES A MASSIVE REDUCTION IN VOTING LOCATIONS WOULD RESULT IN LONGER LINES. AND LARGER AND POTENTIALLY UNSAFE GATHERINGS ON ELECTION DAY. SB FOUR TWENTY THREE IT WILL ENSURE. THAT WE WILL NOT BE IN THAT WILL ENSURE THAT THAT WILL NOT BE THE CASE IN CALIFORNIA.

ONE THING I JUST WANTED TO BRING UP IS OBVIOUSLY MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU AND I WORKED- TOGETHER ON ON THIS ISSUE AND WE PASSED- SB EIGHT SIX SORRY AB EIGHT SIXTY. PROVIDES FOR AN ALL MAIL BALLOT ELECTION. IN NOVEMBER I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH TO HELP INSURE A SAFE ELECTION COMING FORWARD. ONE OF MY PRINCIPAL. POLICY DISAGREEMENTS ON ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT IT DOESN'T FACT LIMIT ACCESS- AND THAT UNDER VOTER CHOICE ACT WOULD HAVE TEN DAYS FOR PEOPLE. TO GO INTO ONE OF THOSE- CENTERS AND EITHER GET HELP OR TO VOTE- UNDER THIS LEGISLATION- IF THEY OP THEY WOULD IT'S ONLY GONNA BE THREE DAYS. BEFORE THE ELECTION AND ALSO POLLING PLACES- YOU KNOW MAKE TRADITIONAL POLLING PLACES THAT A PERSON IS USED TO GOING TO. MAY GO AWAY- CONCERNING TO ME AT THAT WERE YOU KNOW. WE WANT TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY ALSO FIRST IF THE- STAMP. IF EVERYBODY GO ONE IN THERE FOR FOUR DAYS ONLY. AT WHEREAS BEANS IS DOUBT- I DO UNDERSTAND I SUPPORT THE WAIVER PROCESS. THAT ALLOW THE COUNTY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED A FACILITY OR THIS THIS TYPE OF FACILITY THAT WE USUALLY USE IS NOT GONNA WORK. WE HAVE THAT ABILITY HOWEVER DISICK BLAME WITH YOU THAT'LL- FOR THE FOUR DAY THIS- AND PROTECT. TO HAVE TAX. NO OTHER THERE USED GOING TO I CAN THAT AS BEING FOR ACTS SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED SPEAK TO THOSE THOSE ISSUES BUT THAT'S ONE OF MY BIG- FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS CURRENT POLICY YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE- THE CONCERNS I DO WANT TO. JUST KIND OF. MAKE SURE TO REMIN FOLKS THAT THIS IS VOLUNTARY THAT THAT OF COUNTIES WANT TO THAT THEY CAN STICK WITH- THE CURRENT. SYSTEM THAT THEY USE WHETHER THERE ARE VOTERS CHOICE ACTOR NON VOTERS FOR EXACT. COUNTY BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE POINT THAT YOU MAKE I MEAN I THINK. WHAT THE AUTHOR THE CENTER WAS TRYING TO DO WORKING WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS WHETHER IT'S THE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. THE ADVOCATE GROUPS- YOU KNOW HAD THE VOTER ADVOCACY GROUPS EVERYBODY IS TRY TO. CREATE AS MUCH- YOU KNOW OPPORTUNITY AS POSSIBLE WHILE ALSO. BE COGNIZANT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST GET YEAH DUE TO COVE IT IN AND DO THAT- YOU KNOW THE DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING PEOPLE TO VOLUNTEER AND OF FINDING A PHYSICAL LOCATIONS THAT ARE WILLING TO. THEY CRIED THERE'S I THINK THE EVERYBODY. THAT WAS JUST EASIER TO DO THAT FOR THE FOUR DAYS- AND THAT THAT WOULD STILL PROVIDE CON AS MUCH. ACCESS AS AS POSSIBLE GIVEN CODE AND THEN IT IS ALSO COMPLEMENT TO MAILING EVERYBODY A BALLOT- INTO THE HOPE IS THAT YOU KNOW MUCH MORE PEOPLE WITH THIS VOTE FROM HOME. AND FEWER PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO VOTE IN PERSON BUT I YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE POINTS THAT YOU'RE REYES- BUT BUT DO WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS IS VOLUNTARY FOR COUNTIES TO. TO OPT INTO IF THEY WANT TO. THE IF THEY DON'T WANT TO THEN THEY CAN DO THAT. THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM. OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M WAS APPROVED BY- MISS WEBBER SECOND BY MISTER CALDERON ADD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE NO SERMON. OKAY WELL WITH THAT- I MEAN I WILL BE OPPOSING TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT FUNDAMENTAL- YOU KNOW POLICY DIFFERENCE- THERE AGAIN I THINK NUMBER ONE WE WANT PEOPLE TO VOTE THEIR BALLOT YEAH THAT'S MAILED TO THEM AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE SAFEST WAY BUT IN THE EVENT THE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW FOR WHATEVER REASON NEED ASSISTANCE OTHERWISE I THINK WE SHOULD TRYING KEEP THIS ELECTION IS STATUS QUO AS POSSIBLE SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THEY CAN GO TO VOTE AND TO GET HELP- SO THAT'S MY PRIMARY AND THEN. AS YOU KNOW SECONDARILY I DON'T LIKE HOW THIS PROCESS WENT ONE ABOUT A MAJOR WE ARE AS YOU SAID A HUNDRED DAYS OUT- WE THE LEGISLATURE DID IN FACT ACT- WE PASSED EIGHT SIXTY YEAR LEGISLATION ON A BIPARTISAN FASHION- YEAH THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS THAT THE GOVERNOR NEEDED TO DO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AHEAD OF US- AND I AND I DON'T REALLY LIKE KIND OF ALMOST. YOU KNOW- APPROVING OF THAT YOU KNOW BY KIND OF COME IN BEHIND HIM BUT WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LEGISLATURE THAT ENACTED THIS THING. AND NOT THE- WAY AROUND BUT WITH THAT YOU KNOW I'LL SO I WILL BE OPPOSE IN TODAY ALL RIGHT. STRICKLER TO THE CULTURAL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BERMAN HI BERMAN I GALLAGHER NO GALLAGHER NO CALDERON CALDERON HI LOW. LOW I MAYES. MAYES NOT VOTING MULLIN MULLIN I WEBER WEBER I. FIVE TO ONE OKAY THE BILL IS OUT ON A FIVE TO ONE VOTE AND- WE NOW MOVE TO- CENTER NUMBER X. NEXT BILL WHICH I BELIEVE IS- SB NINE SEVENTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. CALIFORNIA HAS TRADITIONALLY HELD ITS PRIMARY ELECTIONS IN JUNE WITH THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS OCCURRING BECAUSE OF A DESIRE TO HAVE A GREATER SAY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL. NOMINATING PROCESS I SUPPORT KEEPING OUR PRESS PRIME IN MORE AND THIS BILL WILL NOT CHANGE THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES HOWEVER THERE IS GOOD REASON TO MOVE ARGUMENT FOR PRIMARIES BACK TO JUNE. EXCUSE ME SB NINE SEVENTY JOINTLY AUTHORED BY SENATOR UMBERG IN MYSELF. AND PRINCIPALLY CO AUTHORED BY BOTH THE PRO TEM IN THE SPEAKER. WILL ENSURE THAT OUR GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY ELECTIONS WILL REMAIN IN JUNE. THERE ARE TWO MAIN REASONS TO KEEP THE GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY IN JUNE. BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING EFFECTS OF COVERT NINETEEN AT THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS SOUGHT. CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR ADDITIONAL MONTHS. TO DELIVER THE CENSUS DATA NEEDED TO REAPPORTIONED CONGRESS. AND EVERY JOB IN FREE DRAW CONGRESSIONAL STATE LEGISLATIVE AND LOCAL DISTRICTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WITH SOME RELATED THE TWO WHILE SOME RELATED DETAILS MAY STILL BE PENDING. WE'VE BEEN AS SHORT AS THE THAT THE DELAY WILL BE APPROVED. THAT DELAY WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. THE LA AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS AND OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO COMPLETE THEIR WORK UNDER CURRENT LEGAL DEADLINES. THOSE DEADLINES MUST BE COMMENSURATELY ADJUSTED AND STILL MUST THE DATE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO PRIMARY. THE OTHER BUT THIS WAS REDUCE LENGTH OF THE AND FOR ELECTIONS GOAL. IN FORTY SIX THE WHITE ELECTION. FOR ACTION. HAS BEEN HELD IN JUNE WITH THE LOAN IF OF TWO THOUSAND TWO EMERGE GUBERNATORIAL RESULTS IN AN UNNECESSARILY ELONGATED ELECTION CYCLE WITH THE GAP BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND THE GENERAL ELECTION AT EIGHT MONTHS MOVING THE PRIMARY TO JUNE WHICH CERTAIN THE ELECTION SEASON TO A MUCH MORE REASONABLE FIVE MONTHS. SOME MIGHT ARGUE THAT HAVING A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY IN MARCH IN A GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY IN JUNE WILL CONFUSE VOTERS THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST SB NINE SEVENTY IS SUPPORTED BY COMMON CAUSE THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUST AND HAS NO OPPOSITION HE WAS APPROVED BY THE SENATE ON A CONSENT ITEM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I WOULD NOW LIKE TO INVITE NICHOLAS HIDE ONE WITH COMMON CAUSE INDOOR WROTE WAS WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. SO BY OVER THE PHONE LINE. FROM FORTY. THE PRIMARY SUPPORT WITNESS GO AHEAD AND PROCEED. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE FOR THE LIQUEFIED ON REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA CALLING CALL ONE OF THE POTS CAN YOU GET YOUR ME. YEAH WE ARE YOU.

BUT AS YOU'RE WEARING OF THE CHAIRS MENTION COVERED NINETEEN THAT SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED THE ANTICIPATED COMPLETION AND RELEASE DATE OF THE FEDERAL US CENSUS DATA WHICH MOST STATES ICLUDING CALIFORNIA ALLY ON TO REDISTRICTING. AEROSMITH THE REDUCING DATA MAY BE DELAYED BY AS MUCH AS FOUR MONTHS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT OF GRANTED THIS LEGISLATURE'S EMERGENCY SESSION EXTEND THE RESISTING DEADLINE OF DECEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR STATE CORRECTIONAL. HOW FOR MARCH BLIND. UP FOR MARCH OF THE IS ACTUALLY AFTER THE QUE THAT NOMINATION OPENED AND IT. A LITTLE IMPOSSIBILITY FURTHER CORGAN PREVENT. EVEN IF CORD CAN RESTRUCTURE THE NOMINATION DEADLINE IS NOT IDEAL WITH DECEMBER REDUCING DEADLINE TO GET CAN APPLY FROM THREE MONTHS THE KNOWING DISTRICT POINT THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS IN MARCH. TO PUT IT SUCCINCTLY THE EXTENSION WOULD BE GRANTED ONLY WORKS OF THE STATE PRIMARIES MOVE FROM MARCH TO JUNE AS WELL. THE CHANGE IS NOT ONLY NEEDED FOR THE STATE ALSO AROUND ONE HUNDRED COUNTY AND CITIES THE CONSOLE THEIR LOW. THE STATE. THREE CAN MOVING FOR THE- FOR PRESS LIKE TO FIFTY. MAKING CAN TO COMPETE AND CAL. IN OUR STATE PROBLEMS. HOWEVER NON PRESIDENTIAL YEARS WE DO THE ONGOING BENEFITS DURING THE PRIMARY BACK TO JIM AS WELL.

IF YOU KNOW LIMITS THE FIELD THE CANDIDATES HIMSELF FINDING WORK FORCES CANDIDATES TO SPEND MORE TIME FOR RAISING WHICH WE ALL KNOW IT IS. NOT A GREAT THING ONLY NEED FOR MORE CAMPAIGN CASH INCREASE OF THE APPOINT THE SPECIAL INTERESTS OVER THE- INTEREST OF ORDINARY. VOTERS IN CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT HAS TO START EARLIER WHICH TAKES PRESSURE TIME OKAY THE FOLKS ON PALM MAKING. EXACTLY WHAT WITH DO YOU STUDY OUT THERE FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION THAT SHOWED AT LEAST OUT BY EXCESSIVELY LONG. CAN AN EIGHT MONTH BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND GENERAL. HUGE SPACE THE TIME TO MAINTAIN VOTER ENGAGEMENT IF I BELIEVE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT IT'S EASIER TO EDUCATE PEOPLE OF CANADA IN ABOUT ISSUES. WHEN THAT TIME FRAME IS MORE. PEOPLE CAN BE REMEMBER WHO THEY VOTED FOR THE PRIMARY ELECTION AND WHY. WE BELIEVE THAT SB NINE SEVENTIES BOTH NECESSARY FOR THE PRACTICAL REASONS THAT WERE STATED AND IT'S ALL OF THE BENEFITS CALIFORNIA VOTERS. THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS THE CALIFORNIA- JUST.

YOU KNOW I MEAN WE KEEP MOVING IT TO MARCH AND THEN BACK TO JUNE I THOUGHT WE HAD KIND OF MADE A FINAL. POLICY DECISION WHEN WE PASSED THE LEGISLATION A FEW YEARS AGO A COUPLE YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE MADE OF. YOU KNOW- VERY IMPASSIONED SPEECH ON THE FLOOR- AT AND SEVERAL OF US AND- AS REPUBLICANS SUPPORTED THAT MEASURE AS WELL TO MOVE IT TO- TO MARCH AND JUST KEEP IT THERE- I GET WITH THE US CENSUS WHAT THAT POSES THE DELAY- BUT THAT MIGHT BE AN ARGUMENT FOR JUST DOING IT FOR THIS ONE ELECTION- RATHER THAN KIND OF DOING IT PERMANENTLY WHICH IT SEEMS LIKE THE- BILL THE- SO. THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH IT- AND SO THAT'S WHY I WOULD BE OPPOSE IN I FEEL LIKE WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED AS A LEGISLATURE- THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE. MARCH PRIMARIES- FROM NOW ON I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE ISSUE OF. YOU KNOW PROLONGED CAMPAIGN- EITHER A MINISTER IT'S A PROP I CAMPAIGN IN A GENERAL JUST LIKE ALWAYS IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE MARCH- YOU KNOW FROM HERE.

AND AGAIN I pTHINK WE'VE ALREADY MADE THAT POLICY DETERMINATION SO I. THAT THAT'S WHY I WOULD BE- IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AND LET'S JUST KEEP IT KEEP IT JUNE MAYBE DO SOMETHING MORE IT'S JUST FOR THIS OF THIS KIND UPCOMING PRIMARY- FOR TWENTY TWENTY. TWO BECAUSE OF THE CENSUS ISSUE BUT OTHERWISE KEEP IT IN PLACE- ANY OTHER. COMMENTS QUESTIONS NOPE YES MISTER MAYES.

THE STERN HE SAID LET'S MOVE ON TO THE LAST ITEM OF THE AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB SEVEN THIRTY NINE. WITH THE SUMMER MULLIN PRESENTING ON CENTER STERN BEHALF FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WERE INTERESTED IN SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF OR IN OPPOSITION TO SB SEVEN THIRTY NINE PLEASE CALL IN NOW THAT'S ON NUMBER MULLIN THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF SENATOR STERN YOU MAY PROCEED. THEY GIVE US CHAIR NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ALL REGISTER CALIFORNIANS WILL RECEIVE A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. FOR SOME VOTERS THIS WILL BE RETAINED BUT FOR OTHERS THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE CAST THEIR BALLOTS FROM THE SAFETY OF THEIR HOME. IN AN AGE OF INFORMATION WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE RECEIVING ONLY THE MOST REAL RELIABLE AND CORRECT INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR- RIGHT TO APPLY FOR RECEIVE OR RETURN A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. CURRENTLY IT IS A MISDEMEANOR FOR PERSON TO DISTRIBUTE INFORMATION WITH AN INTENT TO DECEIVE VOTERS ABOUT THE LOCATION OF POLLING PLACES. ABOUT THE QUALIFICATIONS TO REGISTER TO VOTE IN THE QUALIFICATIONS TO VOTE. HOWEVER THE LAW IS SILENT WHEN IT COMES TO DELIBERATE MISINFORMATION DISTRIBUTION REGARDING A VOTE BY MAIL QUALIFICATIONS. THAT'S WHY SB SEVEN THIRTY NINE ADDS ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS TO VOTE BY MAIL MIS INFORMATION. FARMING CALIFORNIANS WITH CORRECT INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING BY MAIL IS IMPORTANT BOTH. FOR THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTION AND THE CONFIDENCE OF OUR VOTERS. IN LATE APRIL THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY OR SOMEWHAT LIKELY. THAT THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THIS ONLY FURTHER UNDERLINES HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO RESTORE VOTER CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTION. VOTERS WHO DON'T VOTE BY MAIL MAY NOT KNOW FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THEY CAN RETURN THEIR BALLOTS TO ANY POLLING LOCATION OR COUNTY ELECTIONS DROP OFF BOX THEY CAN RETURN THEIR BALLOT EVEN IF IT IS POSTMARKED ON ELECTION DAY. AND THEY CAN CHECK THE STATUS OF THEIR BALLOT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. WITH THEIR COUNTY. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER AND SB SEVEN THIRTY NINE IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURES TAKEN TO EMPOWER PROTECT VOTERS AS THEY FULFILL CITIZENS. MOST SACRED OBLIGATION. LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE AS AUTHOR AMENDMENTS THE URGENCY CLAUSE. APPROVED BY THE RULES COMMITTEE EARLIER TODAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN.

BUT BACK TO MY THEME I THINK IN THIS HEARING AS IT I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME CONFUSION AND SO WHAT IF SOMEBODY IS SAYING HEY YOU YOU HAVE. TEN DAYS YOU KNOW TO GO TO A VOTE CENTER TO GET ASSISTANCE AND IN FACT YOU REALLY DON'T YOU ONLY HAVE THREE DAYS BECAUSE THIS THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY. YOU KNOW HAS OPTED TO JUST GO THREE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION- I MEAN YOU COULD SEE THAT THERE COULD BE STATEMENTS THAT ARE MADE. BECAUSE OF THE CONFUSION OF THIS AND THAT'S REALLY AND AGAIN MY POINT AS WELL SHE TRYING KEEP THINGS THE STATUS QUO AND KEEP. ACCESS THE STATUS QUO AS POSSIBLE- I DO HAVE SOME. SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE ALL WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE DON'T WANT. INTENTIONAL MISSTATEMENTS BEING MADE OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW THIS WOULD HELP PROTECT AGAINST THAT.
