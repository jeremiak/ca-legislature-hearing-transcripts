SURE THAT WOULD BE FINE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE MISTER GREG GOING PERSON BUT. WE ARE GOING TO GO OUT OF ORDER THANK YOU MISTER GRAY. BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO ITEM NUMBER. I DON'T NUMBER THIS IS FOR THANK YOU I A. B. THIRTY THREE TWELVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY. AND PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS- AND APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION ALLOWED ME TO GO OUT OF ORDER AND GET BACK TO GOVERNOR ORGANIZATION. I THINK COMMITTEE AT NOW CIS DOES A FANTASTIC JOB OF PUTTING THIS BILL IN CONTEXT. THE ANALYSIS NOTES THAT THE LAW. GENERALLY REQUIRES CITY ANNEXATIONS TO BE CONTIGUOUS AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS NEVER JUDICIOUS. ABOUT AUTHORIZING EXEMPTIONS FROM THAT RULE WITH THE LAST NOTED EXEMPTION APPROVED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOR THE CITY OF CARP CUPERTINO. THE NOW SAYS ASK MEMBERS CONSIDER IF THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FACING THE CITY OF MERCED UC MERCED WARRANT ONE OF THOSE RARE EXCEPTIONS. I BELIEVE I HOPE% YOU'LL AGREE- AN EXEMPTION IS WARRANTED YOU SEE MERCED IS THE YOUNGEST CAMPUS THE UC SYSTEM WHICH IS BASED CHALLENGES TO ITS GROWTH SINCE ITS INCEPTION. THE GREAT RECESSION JUST STRUCK JUST AS THE CAMPUS WAS LAUNCHING FORCED YOU SEE MERCED TO TURN TO PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO GROW AS PROMISED. WORKING IN A FUNDING DRIED UP OKAY THANK YOU. CONTINUE ALL PAUSE FOR A MOMENT I. HEARING NOTHING FOR THE CAMPUS- WAS CITED THREE MILES FROM THE NEAREST COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH ANTICIPATION THE DEVELOPMENT WOULD OCCUR AROUND THE CAMPUS TO WRITE ESSENTIAL SERVICES LIKE OFF CAMPUS STUDENT HOUSING FOOD AND GROCERY OPTIONS IN AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION. AS THE CAMPUS NEARS ITS TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY AND HAS NOW ENROLLED TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS THOSE ANTICIPATED COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION FACED BY NO OTHER CAMPUS IN THE UC SYSTEM. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES THE STATE'S MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT UC MERCED HAS BY ALL ACCOUNTS PROVED A MASSIVE SUCCESS. THE MERCED IS THE MOST ETHNICALLY AND CULTURALLY DIVERSE CAMPUS IN THE UC SYSTEM. AS A MAJORITY MINORITY CAMPUS MORE THAN 70% OF STUDENTS ARE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE. AND A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. USED TO MERCED HAS ALSO ROLLED THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UN DOCUMENTS STUDENTS IN THE UC SYSTEM. AND THE CAMPUS HAS BEEN DESIGNATED BOTH AS A HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION AND AN ASIAN AMERICAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER SERVING INSTITUTION. UC MERCED IS DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT. BUT CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE GROWING PAINS. AB THIRTY THREE TWELVE IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN ERROR EXEMPTION TO CURRENT LAW AND ATTEMPT TO SUPPORT THE CAMPUS'S FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. INCLUDING PREPARATIONS TO ESTABLISH A MEDICAL SCHOOL UC MERCED AT UCSF FRESNO. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW ALLISTER- EMPHASIZE THAT ALLOW NOT REQUIRE THE CITY OF MERCED TO ANNEX THE CAMPUS THROUGH A ROAD STRIP ANNEXATION. WHILE CONTINUING TO REQUIRE ANY PROPOSED ANNEXATION TO RECEIVE LASKO APPROVAL. ONCE THE CAMPUS IS ANNEXED THE BILL WILL SUBSEQUENTLY ALLOW CONTIGUOUS PROPERTIES TO BE ANNEXED WHILE CONTINUING TO REQUIRE LAUGHTER APPROVAL. OUTSIDE THE BENEFITS OF THE CAMPUS THIS ARRANGEMENT WILL ALSO DIRECTLY BENEFIT THE MANY UNDERSERVED AND LOW INCOME HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE MERCED. THE VIRGINIA SMITH TRUST DONATED THE LAND UC MERCED CURRENTLY OCCUPIES AND OWNS ADDITIONAL LAND CONTIGUOUS TO THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE CAMPUS. THE TRUST IS OPERATED BY THE MERCED COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND IT'S PROCEEDS ARE DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STUDENTS GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL WITHIN THE CITY OF BURSA. ANY DEVELOP THE BENEFITS THE TRUST ENHANCES THE SCHOLARSHIP FUND. LOCAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CITY COUNTY YOU SEE AN MERCED LAUGHTER ON GOING AND I WANT TO THANK CAL LAUGHED GO FOR THE REMAINING NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL IN RECOGNITION OF THOSE LOCAL CONVERSATIONS. TODAY ON THE PHONE- IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I HAVE THE MERCED COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS STEVE KEY CHEN- HE'S- NOT ALWAYS TO END EXCUSE ME THE PLANNING EXTRA FOR THE VIRGINIA SMITH TRUSTS STEVEN PACK. WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR ALL. ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OR WE CAN MOVE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE TWO WITNESSES GREAT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM SUPPORT WITNESSES STEEP KEYGEN AND A MODERATOR CAN YOU OPEN THE MIKE PLEASE.

APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AS WE TRIED OF MANEUVER THE TECHNICAL PIECE OF THIS. OKAY. AS A REMINDER THOSE OF YOU THAT WILL BE CALLING IN REMEMBER TO MUTE YOUR PHONES AS YOU CALL IN AND UNDERNEATH THEM. IT PLEASES THE CHAIR I COULD. EXPAND MY TESTIMONY TO- SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE OF THE HISTORY THAT I'M SURE MR THIESSEN WILL SHARE WITH YOU. YOU KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO I THINK THAT WOULD BE NICE WHILE WE WAIT NAY IF WE JUST CAN'T GET THEM WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AND THE SUPPORT BY THE CHAIR SO. WHEN YOU GO AHEAD OF US THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES KNOW- I'VE WORKED WITH THIS INSTITUTION THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOR- SOMETIME- MOST RECENTLY AS A MEMBER LEGISLATURE BUT- NEXT MONTH I WILL CELEBRATE. THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF WHEN I FIRST TOOK A JOB HERE IS A- RECENTLY- GRADUATED.STUDENT FROM UC SANTA BARBARA AND- AT THAT TIME I WORKED FOR GENTLEMAN THAT DENNIS CARDOZA WHO WAS OUR STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOR MERCED COUNTY- AND STANISLAUS COUNTY AND- WE WERE RIGHT AT THE KIND OF THE INCEPTION OF UC MERCED- THEY HAD. APPROVED IT WE'RE GOING TO THE PLANNING PROCESS AND- IN PART OF THE HISTORY OF THAT IS MANY COMMUNITIES COMPETED TO HAVE A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND- THE CENTRAL VALLEY FELT VERY STRONGLY THERE SHOULD BE ONE- IN OUR IN OUR AREA. AND FRESH- HAD SOME LAND SAID HAD SOME AND IT CENTER ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES LOW. THE UNIVERSITY NOW FOR SAID IN. SEVERAL FACT THIS GIFT OF. THE VIRGINIA SMITH TRUST HAD OFFERED AND THE VIRGINIA SMITH TRUST WAS MORE CATTLE RANCH AND- THEY HAD LEFT THAT. MONEY THE PROCEEDS OF THE RANCH TO BENEFIT THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND SCHOLARSHIPS IN FACT I RECEIVED A SCHOLARSHIP AS A YOUNG PERSON FROM THE VIRGINIA SMITH- FUND. AN OBVIOUSLY BY DONATING SOME LAND TO BUILD THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEY- OFFERED A GREAT DEAL TO THE STATE BUT THEY ALSO OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY OF POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THE FUTURE ON SOME OF THAT LAND WHICH WOULD THEN GENERATE. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TOWARD SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THE BILL THAT I HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY MEMBERS IS KIND OF THE- TWENTY YEARS LATER FRUITION OF THAT VISION RIGHT- WE HAVE STRUGGLED TO DEVELOP THAT LAND BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE- PROVISIONS REQUIRING CITIES TO GROW- OUTWARD. AND BECAUSE-THIS- UNIVERSITY THIS STATE INVESTMENT HAD BEEN PLACED- SOME MILES OUTSIDE THE CITY BOUNDARIES SO- TODAY WERE ABLE TO BRING A BILL FORWARD THAT WOULD- I THINK FAST TRACK SOME OF THAT DEVELOPMENT WOULD FAST TRACK FUNDS INTO THOSE- YOU KNOW INTO THESE- TRUST THAT WOULD BENEFIT YOUNG PEOPLE- NOT TO MENTION. WOULD BENEFIT THE TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS- AT THAT UNIVERSITY WHO- ARE EAGER TO HAVE A COFFEE SHOP ACROSS THE STREET FOR. SOME STUDENT HOUSING ACROSS THE STREET SOME OF THOSE OPTIONS AND THEN GOING FORWARD WILL BE ABLE TO KIND OF- MARY THE CITY OF MERCED WITH THE STATE- UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA AS THEY GROW TOWARDS EACH OTHER. SO THIS IS REALLY A WIN WIN WIN I REALIZE IT'S A RARE EXCEPTION THERE WERE BUT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ASKING YOU KNOW FOR EACH FOR THAT BUT I THINK. THE MORE YOU LOOK INTO IT AND- HISTORY OF THIS- IN TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY- FOR ALL SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION- TODAY A. I WOULD REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. I'M I JUST WANNA SAY THE WHAT YOU SEE MERCED IS DONE IS PHENOMENAL AND I AM SO IMPRESSED BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING UP THE CAMPUS IN OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES OUT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- WE HAVE HAD EVEN- MY CHIEF OF STAFF DAUGHTERS GRADUATED FROM THERE AND LOVES THE PLACE AND STILL GOING TO SCHOOL THERE. BUT ANYWAY- WITH THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A PAUSE BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO YOUR- I THINK IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE RIVER WHEN I. YEAH WHAT GO HEAD TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS ON. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT. GO AHEAD ASK ME SOME REMEMBER THANK YOU INTO THE CHAIRMAN GRADE JUST A QUICK QUESTION ON THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE ON THERE IT IS THE CITY OF OR SAID THAT HAS A SPUR OF INFLUENC IN THAT AREA THAT.

THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT AS A LOCAL CRIME AND OF COURSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT THAT'S A STATE REQUIREMENT THAT WE IMPOSED ON THE LOCALS MANY YEARS AGO THAT WERE ACTUALLY.

LAST YEAR I DEPENDED ON CELL SERVICES TO DELIVER BOTH. DELIVER CRITICAL PIECES OF INFORMATION TO MY CONSTITUENTS WHEN THE SADDLE RIDGE FIRE BURNED THROUGH MY DISTRICT I HATE TO IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO OUR MOBILE DEVICES. TO PREVENT WILDFIRES ENERGY COMPANIES MAY CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS WHICH TURNS OFF THE COMMERCIAL POWER SOURCE TO RESIDENTS IN THE AREA. IF THE CELL SITES ARE OFF LINE MOST CELL PHONES WILL BE INOPERABLE PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK DURING A POTENTIAL EMERGENCY. THIS IS WHY THIS MEASURE HAS WIDE RANGING SUPPORT FROM ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS AS WELL AS MANY OTHER LOCAL SHERIFFS AND PUBLIC SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS.

AS YOU WELL KNOW IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED PS PS EVENTS THAT WERE UNPRECEDENTED IN BOTH SCOPE AND SCALE. HE'S EXTENDED COMMERCIAL POWER OUTAGES HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. HE EVEN ASKED WE NAVIGATE THE IMPACTS. OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC TODAY. OPENING IN PROVIDERS ARE PREPARING FOR THE UPCOMING WILDFIRES EATEN UP TOMORROW AND THE POSSIBILITY OF WIDESPREAD PS PS SEVEN IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING OUR PART TO MAKE SURE OUR NETWORK REMAINS RESILIENT TO THE LOTS OF COMMERCIAL POWER. WE'RE IMPLEMENTING MULTI YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES NEW FIXED AND MOBILE GENERATORS BACK UP UPGRADES AND MUCH MORE. TO THAT END WERE INVESTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHAT THE STAFFERS HOWEVER INCONSISTENT PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS ACROSS LOCAL JURISDICTION AND A LENGTHY REVIEW TIMES ARE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER AND SOURCE OF DELAY. SO WE NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE AND GENTLEMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE REST OF THE LEGISLATURE TO RAPIDLY ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF IMPROVING BACKUP POWER AT CELL SITES IN TIME FOR UPCOMING WILDFIRE SEASON. BACKUP POWER ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY AS YOU KNOW IS A SHARED PRIORITY FOR THE STATE. NEEDS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND FIRST RESPONDERS AND FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS AS WELL AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY ONE IS NARROWLY TAILORED THAT NARROWLY TAILORED MEASURE THAT WILL EXPEDITE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE BACKUP SOLUTION.

AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LEARN READ REPRESENTING THE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA KNOWN AS POOR ACT IT IS SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PUBLIC SAFETY MEMBERS. IN NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION I PER OUR SCHOOLS AND THEIR FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEMBERS WHO BOTH SHARE SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY ONE WHICH WOULD ENABLE CALIFORNIA TAKE TIME IT'S TIME TO STEPS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS. DURING UPCOMING WILDFIRE SEASONS AND OTHER POTENTIAL POWER SHUT OFFS BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES. VERSUS PONDERS ACROSS THE STATE RELY ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS TO HELP LOCATE INDIVIDUALS DURING EMERGENCY SITUATIONS COORDINATE WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ULTIMATELY SAVE MORE LIVES. AT THE WHITE. WORK IS RESERVE DURING COMMERCIAL POWER OUTAGES AS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDING FIRST RESPONDERS WITH CONNECTIVITY THEY REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES AND KEEP COMMUNITIES AND THE PUBLIC SAFE EVEN ONE COMMERCIAL POWER IS LOST HE CALIFORNIA'S MUST BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO THE NINE ONE ONE AND RESERVE EMERGED IN RECEIVE EMERGENCY COMMITTEE NOTIFICATIONS IN COMMUNICATIONS. INCLUDING WIRELESS IS AMERICA'S DILLARD'S BROADCAST BY OUR PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS TWENTY FOUR TWENTY ONE AS A SINGLE AND CRITICAL GOING TO STREAMLINE THE LOCAL PERMITTING PROCESS FOR BACKUP POWER EQUIPMENT AND SELF SIDES WHILE SAFEGUARDING FINAL PERMITTING AUTHORITY WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THAT STREET APARTMENT ACOUSTICS GENERATORS TO MORE CELL SITES WILL HELP INSURE FIRST RESPONDERS CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC AND EACH OTHER THE LEGISLATURE TO USE EVERY TOOL AVAILABLE TO YOU TO RAPIDLY PREPARE FOR THE GROWING OF WILDFIRES POWER SHUT US AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS FOR ALL THESE REASONS AND I'VE TOLD HER YEARS BOTH SUPPORT THE BILL AND WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK FOR HIS WORK. ON IT AND LOSE. AGAIN IN THANK YOU BETTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER REED ARE THE OF WE'VE GOT THROUGH OUR SUPPORT. I BELIEVE IS FINISHED OUR OPPOSITION IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION FROM THE PUBLIC. MODERATOR IF SO. WE DO HAVE ONE FROM- LINE FIFTY THREE OKAY LINE IS OPEN IF I HAD GREAT THANK YOU THANK. THANK YOU IT'S NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT NINE- WE ARE CLOSE TO THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MODERATOR OF THE ANY OTHER IN OPPOSITION. NO MORE OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT- SAYING THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL AND I BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK MIGHT BE HELPING ANSWER THIS QUESTION AS WELL. VERY WELL- I'VE TALKED TO SOME TECHIES AT. VERIZON AND AT AND T. I AM BY THE WAY I'M DOCTOR QUIRK I SUPPORT THIS BILL VERY STRONG THIS IS A GREAT DEAL THIS IS AN ATTACK IN THAT WAY NOW ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE TECHIES LIKE THIS AT LEAST SOME OF THEM AND THIS ISN'T THE CHAIN OF COMMAND OF AT AND T. OR VERIZON THESE ARE JUST THE PEOPLE OUT IN THE FIELD- RIGHT NOW AT THE MACRO TOWERS WHICH IS THE MAIN TOWERS AND THERE'S A LOT A LITTLE SMALL TOWERS OUT THERE- RIGHT NOW. THOSE TOWERS WERE BUILT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND THERE'S ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT- GEAR IN A DIFFERENT GENERATORS DIFFERENT BACK UP DIFFERENT TANGLES THAT BEEN APPROVED THROUGH THE YEARS THIS WILL HELP STANDARDIZE TO A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF QUALITY OVER PROBABLY ABOUT A THIRD WHAT'S IN THERE NOW SO THAT'S A GOOD SUPPORT POINT- AND NOT TO GET TOO FAR TECHNICAL OR IN THE WEEDS THAT'S WHERE I LIVE IN MY WORLD- IF YOU HAVE. A FIFTY HORSEPOWER GENERATOR WITH A HUNDRED NINETY GALLON DOUBLE WALL STORAGE TANK WHICH IS GOOD FOR FIRE THAT GENERATE SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SIX WATTS PER HORSEPOWER THAT'S THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THAT DO IT SUCKS UP FOUR GALLONS OF FUEL AN HOUR SO IF YOU GO AT FULL POWER THEY GIVES YOU TWO DAYS OF BACKUP POWER IF YOU GO AT HALF POWER. AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THESE NEW UNITS WOULD BE CONTROLLED REMOTELY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE MOST OF WHAT THE TOWERS WORK NOW ANY WAY YOU CAN GET FOR DAYS A BACKUP. WITH FOR DAYS A BACKUP AT HALF POWER THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD NEED. YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GET CREWS IN THEIR- TO REBUILD REDO. TRANSFER ALL THE RF. SO THIS IS A VERY GOOD BILL FROM A TECHNICAL VIEWPOINT. FROM A REGULATORY VIEWPOINT SPEEDED UP TO SIXTY DAYS APPROVAL ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE REPLACING OLD OBSOLETE EQUIPMENT JUST SIMPLY MAKES SENSE VERY GOOD DOCTOR QUIRK GREAT BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS TO THE AUTHOR. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE OF WITH THE AUTHOR LIKE TO CLOSE EITHER YOU BEING. A RIVAS OR MISTER QUIRK WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE TO DO. SO AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY BILL POOR. SURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE. ARE THE ONE DAY THAT I BELIEVE THAT ALL THE- BOTH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES FROM MYSELF AT THE STATE. THE STATE GOALS AND SO I WILL WORK VERY CLOSELY COOLEY WITH THEM IN ORDER TO- GET THAT WE ALL FEEL QUITE WHERE EVERYONE FEELS COMFORTABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY- WE HAVE A MOTION OF HIS BE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS I KNOW YOU AYE. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY ONE IS A NARROWLY CRAFTED BILL THAT WILL BETTER PREPARE THE STATE FOR FUTURE EMERGENCIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SEEING NONE WE HAVE A MOTION I'D LIKE TO JUST SAY IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVIEWS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK. FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD ISUPPORT THIS BILLS GOLFER OF IN DURING RELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN THE EVENT OF A POWER OUTAGE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTHORS SUPPORTERS ARE WORKING WITH RC RC AND THE OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATIONS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THEY HAVE BEEN RAISED. WITH THAT IN MIND I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. SECRETARY TAKE THE ROLE PLEASE. MOTION IS DO PASSING RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR-CURRY HI AGUIAR-CURRY I AM LACKEY. LACKEY I BLOOM. BLOOM I BOERNER HORVATH BOERNER HORVATH I RAMOS RAMOS I IT THREE OF US HI THREE OF US I ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT READ US I'D VOEPEL ELECTRIC. VOEPEL I VOTE IS A TWO ZERO. I ALSO THINK YOU CONGRATULATIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- RIVAS AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHT YEAH YOU'RE WELCOME ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY THREE AND WE HAVE OUR OWN ROBERT RIVAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. YOU CAN START WHEN YOU'RE READY SIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES IT'S- GREAT TO BE BACK EVEN THOUGH WE ARE HERE UNDER PRESIDENTE CIRCUMSTANCES- I DON'T WANT TO THANK OUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THIS BILL AND ON ON THE ANALYSIS I ACCEPT ALL THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. IS AMENDMENTS HELP ADDRESS- AND CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND CERTAINLY HAVE HELPED TO MAKE THE BILL A STRONGER. AND SO CERTAINLY NO ONE WOULD HAVE PREDICTED HOW QUICKLY THIS HEALTH CRISIS WHAT TRANSFORM OUR LIVES. AND ALTHOUGH HERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY MOVING FORWARD. WE CAN BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT ARE PRE PANDEMIC HOUSING PROBLEMS ARE CERTAINLY ONLY GONNA GET WORSE THIS THIS BILL HERE TODAY ASSEMBLY BILL THREE ONE FIVE THREE- INCENTIVIZE BIKE AND CAR SHARE PARKING. IN NEW HOUSING- DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THIS BILL IS NOT VERY BROAD IN SCOPE. BUT CHALLENGES US TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT PARKING MINIMUMS. IT'S SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO HOUSING DID DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN REDUCING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VEHICLE PARKING SPACES THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IF THEY PROVIDE NON REQUIRED LONG TERM BIKE PARKING SPACES CARSHARING SPACES OR BOTH. AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT ALL SUCH VEHICLE PARKING REDUCTION CREDITS WERE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED TO BE CAPPED AT 30% AND SO ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS- THAT THAT THAT WE TOOK IN IT IT DOESA GREAT JOB IN IN THE ANALYSIS- IN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE WHEN AND WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE THIS AMENDMENT. WAS AT THIS 30% CAP THOSE PROPOSED WAS AMENDMENT WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE VEHICLE PARKING REDUCTION TEARS AND SO- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A TEST REQUIREMENTS WITH THESE TWO YEARS SINCE THE ONE SUCH TEAR WOULD ALLOW A MAX OF UP 230% IF A PROJECT IS ELIGIBLE FOR A DENSITY BONUS AND IS LOCATED WITHIN HALF A MILE OF MAJOR TRANSIT STOP. THE SECOND AND THERE'S IT- ESSENTIALLY TO OTHER TEARS BOTH INVOLVING A MAX OF 50% PARKING REDUCTION IF THE PROJECT IS ELIGIBLE FOR IDENTITY BONUS OR IS LOCATED WITHIN A HALF MILE OF A MAJOR TRYING TO STOP BUT CERTAINLY NOTHING IN THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT TO MORE GENERAL STANDARDS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW THIS BILL IS NOT VERY BROAD IN SCOPE- BUT THIS ISSUE OF PARKING MINIMUMS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. BECAUSE PARKING MINIMUMS HAVE UNINTENDED IMPACTS. PARKING MINIMUMS DRIVE UP THE COST OF HOUSING. THEY CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNITS PRODUCED. AND IN SOME INSTANCES HAVING THIS FLEXIBILITY AS THIS BILL PROPOSES TO STRATEGICALLY REDUCE VEHICLE PARKING SPACES WILL PROMOTE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOBILITY IT COULD BOOST PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERSHIP WHERE ASSESSABLE IN AVAILABLE IT COULD ENCOURAGE MORE CYCLING AND PUT TO USE CALIFORNIA'S EXPANDING NETWORK OF BIKE LANES AND GREEN WAYS. SUCH A THIS BILL- THREE ONE FIVE THREE ASSEMBLY BILL THREE ONE FIVE THREE COULD SERIOUSLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BIKE IN CARSHARE PARKING IN HOUSING. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WHILE ALSO MITIGATING OR ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE UNINTENDED IMPACT OF PARKING MINIMUMS. AND I'M JOINED HERE TODAY BY TWO IN THIS IS THE FIRST BEING DAY SNYDER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAL BIKE WHOSE. WHO THEY BECAME A BILL SPONSOR. AND ZACH HILTON A DISTRICT A CONSTITUENT AND A MEMBER OF THE GILROY OF- THE CITY OF GILROY BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN COMMITTEE NOW I'M GOING TO HEAD OVER TO ZAC BUT BEFORE I DO I SHOULD MENTION. THAT THE IDEA FOR THIS BILL CAME FROM ZACK IT WAS AN IDEA THAT WAS GENERATED FROM OUR FIRST EVER THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW PROGRAM. AND AS I MENTIONED BECAUSE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF- OF THE CITY OF GILROY. AS I MENTIONED HE'S PART OF. A MEMBER WAS RECENTLY CHAIR OF THE BICYCLE PEDESTRIAN COMMITTING GILROY. AND HE PROPOSED THIS IDEA BCAUSE HE WANTED TO FIND A WAY. TO INCREASE BY PARKING IN THE CITY OF GILROY. AND SO CERTAINLY WE ARE HERE THIS BILL THREE ONE FIVE THREE THIS IS IT IT IS AN INNOVATIVE A CREATIVE IDEA AROUND PARKING MINIMUMS. KNOWS ALL MADE POSSIBLE BY BY ZACH. AND YOU KNOW HIS ADVOCACY THEN THE CITY OF GALWAY SO WITH THAT I WILL HAND IT OVER TO THEM. MODERATOR. OPEN THE LINE FOR SUPPORT FROM ZAKKA HILTON PLEASE. YEAH AND IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU LIKE TO SHOW SUPPORT TO PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN FOLLOWED BY ZERO. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL AND THE SECOND. IS THAT KILLED IN THERE PLEASE. SELECT COMMITTEE CHAIR MEMBERS STAFF AND THE PUBLIC I'M JACKI HOLDEN RESIDENT OF GILROY CALIFORNIA IN CHAIR OF THE GIVE YOU GO RIGHT BY SCHOOL PENSION COMMITTEE FOR ME THEY NEED FOR A. B. THIRTY ONE FIFTY THREE AGAIN IN AUGUST TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN I FOUND OUT DURING A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT REVIEW. THAT BIKE PARKING IN MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL INVOLUNTARY. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA GREEN BUILDING CODE THE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPER STATED A GALLERY NEEDED TO REFERENCE A CODE THAT STATED BY PARKING WAS REQUIRED. AND THAT IS AT THE SAME TIME THE DEVELOPERS LOOKING FOR CREATIVE WAYS TO REDUCE THEIR VEHICLE PARKING MINIMUMS. THERE WAS NO SUCH LOCAL ORDINANCE OR CLOTHES OR CODE IN YOUR- IMAGINE HAVING A FAMILY OF FOUR STILL LIVE IN AN APARTMENT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD ON. YOU YOUR SPOUSE AND KIDS WANT TO RIDE BIKES WELL WHERE DO YOU STORE THEM. THAT RIGHT THERE MAKES PEOPLE RELY ON CARS FOR MORE COMPLETE LOOK MORE TRAFFIC AND CONGESTION IN THE COMMUNITY. RATHER THAN SUPPORTING THE LOCAL ECONOMY. YOU WILL GET IN THE CAR AND DRIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE. IF THAT'S MORE CONVENIENT. IN TODAY'S HOUSING MARKET ONE IN THREE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. IN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T OWN A CAR. NOT ALL FAMILIES WILL BUILD ON OUR OWN AND SOME WILL STAY IN THE DEPARTMENT AND DEFINITELY. WHETHER A BIKE YOU USED FOR RECREATION OR ESSENTIAL TRANSPORTATION PRESIDENT NEED US. AT FACE SECURE PLACE TO STORE THEIR BICYCLES. I AM HERE IN SUPPORT. OF AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY THREE AND THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AS IT WILL HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT IN CALIFORNIA BY ACHIEVING OUR GOAL TO REDUCE. EMISSIONS FROM ON ROAD. ON ROAD MOTOR VEHICLES IMPROVE AIR QUALITY BANKER YOU KNOW RESIDENT COMMUTERS AND VISITORS. TO KNOW JEFF FROM VEHICLES TO BIKING. AND INCREASES BY KEEN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DRIVE FOR SHORT. AND FIRST LAST MILE TRIPS. CONTINUES OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS USES BENDABLE THAT THE CHANCE THAT. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO REDUCE OUR NECK ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THEIR INNOVATIVE TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS. THIS BILL PROVIDES A SECURE PLACE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO STORE THEIR pACTIVE IN THE CHANGE HAS BEEN ABLE TRANSIT LIKE BIKE IN CAR SURE USAGE. AT THE STATE WE ARE ACTIVELY BREAKING ADVANCING IDEAS AND PROJECTS THE PROMOTE THE CONCEPT OF FREE RANGE PEOPLE. WE ADVOCATE FOR BUILDING AND PLANNING THAT CONSIDERS FUTURE GENERATIONS AS WELL AS CURRENT RESIDENT WHO DON'T ON CARS. IT DANTE MOBILITY OPTION OPTIONS REFLECTS WHAT WE ARE TEACHING THE YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL. ALL MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT BY PARKING IT CALIFORNIA'S VOLUNTARY AND LET THE LOCAL JURISDICTION HAS BEEN ORDER. FAMILY YOUNG ADULTS AND SENIORS ALL NEED IT THEY PLACE MR THEIR BIKE AND INCENTIVES NOT DRIVE THEIR CARS. THIS BILL SUPPORTS THE VISION OF THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. AND ENHANCES CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND LIVABILITY LONG TERM BIKE PARKING WOULD COMBINE THE CARS HERE. A KEY ROLE IN PROVIDING THE STATE'S SUSTAINABLE. INTEGRATED AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THANK YOU AND A CONCLUSION I. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BUT- THANK YOU. MUCH IS THAT HELL TO IS THE SNYDER. TO BE PER. I AM HERE HI. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU- COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU MY NAME IS DAVE SNYDER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION. WE ARE- A STATEWIDE GROUP THAT WORKS TO HELP MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER WORK COMMUNITY FOCUSED ORGANIZATION THAT WANTS TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE EQUITABLE MORE HEALTHY MORE PROSPEROUS MORE INCLUSIVE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PERHAPS MORE JOYFUL BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN RELY ON BICYCLIN TO GET AROUND. WE WORK WITH DOZENS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE STATE WHO THEMSELVES REPRESENT ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO WANT TO SEE MORE BICYCLING. AND WE WORK AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH STATE AGENCIES- AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE POLICIES THAT HELP THEM BE MORE SUCCESSFUL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL% THIS AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY THREE IS ONE OF THOSE POLICIES. IT'S WE ARE GRATEFUL TO US IN THE MEMORY OF US FOR- INTRODUCING IT AND TO THAT COMMITTEE FOR THE AMENDMENTS WHICH TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL. NOW IS AN IMPORTANT TIME TO ADVANCE THIS. IT WILL MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE WE HAVE A BIG HOUSING CRISIS IN THIS WILL DO A LOT TO HELP MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE I'LL DESCRIBE A SCENARIO WHERE ITMAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IF YOU'RE BUILDING- MEDIUM SIZED MULTI UNIT RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS ARE SUCH THAT. BY THE STATE SAY THERE'S TWENTY FIVE UNITS YOU CAN STEP TOWARD TWENTY FIVE SPACES REQUIRED IF YOU CAN FIT TWENTY ON THE GROUND FLOOR BUT HAVING TO FIT TWENTY FIVE REQUIRES YOU TO DIG A HOLE TO BUILD AN UNDERGROUND GARAGE. THAT DRIVES OFF YOUR COST SO MUCH THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PROVIDE ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR DEVELOPERS TO NOT HAVE TO BUILD- HUGE UNDERGROUND GARAGE. WE CAN MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE TO SAME TIME MAKING BICYCLE PARKING IN BICYCLING MORE FEASIBLE. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURE BY PARKING AND A LOT OF COMMUNITIES YOU CAN'T LEAVE YOUR BIKE ON THE STREET OVERNIGHT. AND I'M I CAN'T QUITE SAM A YOUNG GUY ANYMORE BUT- I'M USED TO CARRYING MY BIKE UPSTAIRS IN MY ON MY RIGHT SIDE OF MY BODY IS STRONGER BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T DO THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE RELY ON THEIR BIKES AND THEY CAN'T CARRY. BIKES UP STAIRS MAYBE THEY HAVE A HEAVY BIKE THAT THE USED THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. PEOPLE NEED A SECURE INDOOR PLACE TO PARK THEIR BIKES AND STILL PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT CENTER. SET UP TO DO THAT. LIKE I SAID WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR CNN I'M- ANY QUESTIONS THAT ANYONE MIGHT HAVE. ABOUT THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER SNYDER. MODERATOR ARE THERE IN OTHER PEOPLE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

MADE ADAM RIGHT WE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE ACTUALLY REGISTER YOUR SUPPORT DIDN'T UP EARLIER. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SOUNDS LIKE WE DON'T DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ONLY SUPPORT ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BORDER HARPER YES I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR BEING CREATIVE ABOUT HOW DO WE INCREASE BY PARKING I AGREE WHEN YOU HAVE AN E. BIKE TO TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL IT IS VERY DIFFICULT UP BY IT TAKE THAT UP STAIRS AND YOU DO NEED TO HAVE PARKING IN STORAGE FOR THAT. MY CONCERN AND PERHAPS THE AUTHOR CAN ADDRESS THIS IS- WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT. YOUR MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAMMOTH SO THIS BILL IS THAT 15% REDUCTION IS GIVEN FOR ANY DENSITY BONUS PROJECTS AND IS NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT- CONNECTIVITY TO TRANSIT- THE AVAILABILITY OF BIKE LANES. AVAILABILITY IS SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL SO I CAN I AGREE THAT IN AREAS WHERE. IT THERE ARE THOSE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS IT WOULD BE OPPORTUNE FOR THE CITY TO PASS LOCAL ORDINANCES. THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE IT. COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT FOR ME SO I HAVE A BUT LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY ON THAT. YEAH I CAN TRY TO ADDRESS IT I THINK YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY AS A BILL I PROPOSE JUST A BLANKET CAP OF 30% AND WITH THESE AMENDMENTS YOU HAD THIS TIERED STRUCTURE. TO TAKE I THINK YOUR CONCERN INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT- THOSE THOSE TEARS REFLECT A REDUCTION IN IN IN THE NOVEL CAPS BASED ON LOCATION. SO IF YOU HAVE I'M A DENSITY BONUS YOU'RE ALLOWED A FIFTY PERCENT. OF UP TO A 50% REDUCTION- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT DOES H BONUS IT ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE LOCATION YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT IF. THE PROJECT IS PROPOSED TO BE LOCATED IN HALF MILE OF TRANSIT THEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALLOWED- A MAX OF THE FIFTY PERCENT- MAYBE THE SPONSORS BEGIN TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW I'M- WILLING TO. WORK WITH YOU YOURSELF AND- A YOU KNOW OUR SPONSORS A CALL BY. FOR TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN TO YOU KNOW BE SURE THAT WOULD BUILDING AND MORE- ASSURANCES THAT WE ARE STRATEGICALLY- USING THIS BILL TO BUILD- MORE BIKESHARE OPPORTUNITIES I'M I'M I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT SO. THANK YOU AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE SPONSORS WANT TO ADDRESS IT I SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT DENSITY BONUS PROJECTS THAT WE GET A REDUCTION FOR BIKING WHERE THERE'S NO ACCESS. AND NO PLANS FOR- ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION BIKE LANES SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL SO. WE HAVE A PROJECT THAT THE DENSITY BUT AS PROJECT IN A RURAL AREA OF MY CITY AND THERE'S NO SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL THERE'S NO BY PLANES THERE'S NO PLAN FOR BIKE LANES BECAUSE THERE'S NO WORLD WITH FOR BIKE LANES. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT AT A DENSITY BONUS RETIRED BIRD I REDUCTION PARKING WHAT IS ALREADY REDUCED FROM THE CITY'S PARKING STANDARDS SERVE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A SPECIFIC THING WE DON'T WANT TO DRESS IT NOW I'M HAPPY. VOTE ON THE DAY BILL TODAY. THEN I CAN. THE AUTHOR IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE JUST A PAGE FOR A LOT OF HIGHLY AREAS WERE. MOST YOUR AVERAGE YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN EIGHTY CROWD NEEDS TO HAVE E. BIKES IN ORDER TO MANAGE THOSE HOUSE IT WOULD BE GOOD TO PUT IN SOMETHING OR SELECT VEHICLE STRIPPING. FOR OUR LA. HE BY.

THERE IS- NO QUESTION THAT OUR CURRENT HEALTH CRISIS HAS CREATED NEW CHALLENGES FOR OUR STATE. UP FOR CONSTITUENCIES BACK HOME AND CERTAINLY- WILL ONLY EXACERBATE OUR CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS. SO NOW PRIOR TO THIS PANDEMIC NO THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE YEAR THAT ARE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA FOCUS ON REVERSING THE DECADES OF UNDER BUILDING.

AND SO AS LARGE PROP HOLDERS THEY ARE THEY ARE IN A GOOD POSITION TO FILL AN IMPORTANT GAP. ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN A LAND FOR HOUSING COMES AT A PREMIUM. AS WE ALL KNOW IN CALIFORNIA ELSEWHERE ABSENT A HOUSING SUBSIDY THE HIGH COST OF LAND. MAKES HOUSING INCREDIBLY ON AFFORDABLE. UNFORTUNATELY PLANS TO BUILD NEW HOUSING ON RELIGIOUS PROPERTY OPTED BASS ROAD BLOCKS ONE SUCH ROADBLOCK IS THE INABILITY TO COUNT AVAILABLE PROPERTIES FOR RESIDENTIAL PARKING REQUIREMENTS DUE TO PARKING MINIMUM REGULATION SET AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THIS BILL SAID THE BILL EIGHT FIVE ONE ONE EIGHT FIVE ONE SORRY WOULD ALLOW FOR THE REDUCTION OF RESIDENTIAL PARKING REQUIREMENTS ON RELIGIOUS OR FAITH BASED PROPERTIES. THIS BILL IS A NECESSARY STEP TO HELP STIMULATE HOUSING PRODUCTION THAT OURSTATE VERY WE DO YOU KNOW WE- WE DESPERATELY NEED- YOU KNOW ALL ALL ALL ALL THE HOUSING PRODUCTION WE CAN GET. THIS BILL WON'T SOLVE OUR PROBLEM.

WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YEAH AND I CAN ADDRESS THIS TO EITHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS OR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE- WE DO HAVE THAT MY DISTRICT FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD LIKE TO PRODUCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT WITH KNOWING THAT IS ANY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY WHEN THE LEASE CAR CONTROVERSIAL ONES IN MY DISTRICT MY QUESTION IS ACTUALLY REALLY PRACTICAL QUESTION IS I THINK ONE OF THE PRESENTER MENTION THIS SOMETIMES FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE UNDER UTILIZED PARKING BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM THERE'S A REQUIREMENT IN THE BILL TO HAVE AN ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THAT THAT PARKING IS UNDER LOOT UTILIZED. IN ORDER TO GIVE THE PARKING REDUCTION WHAT THOUGHTS TO AND THEN WE DO HAVE FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY HAVE LIMITED PARKING AND SO IF YOU REDUCE THAT EVEN FURTHER MY QUESTION IS WHERE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO GO ON DAYS WHEN THERE ARE SIR OUT RELIGIOUS SERVICES AND HOW IS THAT OVERFLOW PARKING THREE MANAGE WHEN WE'RE GIVING A REDUCTION. SO I DON'T KNOW IF ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS OR SOMETHING MEMBER WICKS ARE ONE OF THE SPONSORS WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THURMOND SURE THIS IS A NUMBER WHERE AND COMPLETE COVERAGE OF IN HERE AS WELL THAT YOU KNOW I THINK HER TO HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR CURRENT CAN MAKE IT INTO THEIR VIEWS- AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN- OUR CHURCHES HAVE BUILT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING- IS THEY'VE DONE CARPOOL LANE TODAY DONE SHUTTLES THEY'VE DONE ALL KINDS OF CREATIVE WAYS TO ENSURE THAT. THEIR FOLKS CAN REACH THEIR DOORS- AND GETTING THAT THE SELF INTENDED TO DO THAT- AND- WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT TAKING THE BERRIER AWAY FROM ALL THE CHURCHES TO HAVE THIS ISSUE SO THAT. WE CAN HAVE OUR HOUSING IS I THINK OUT OVER WAYS THE ISSUE WHERE YOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE. THE SPACE AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE TRUTH YOU CAN BUILD ON THEIR LOT. THEY CAN IF THEY SO CHOOSE AND THEY CAN DO SO IN A WAY THAT THE MATTER THAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM- IN TERMS OF. DEALING WITH THEIR- THEIR PARTY AT ISSUE. IS TO BRING. YOU ONE AT THAT. WOULD YOU DATE YES BUT WITH. FROM THE WAY. OF TAKE PRACTICE EXPERIENCE YEAH WE HAD THE THING THOUGHT AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM SIR MANY COMMERCE WITH HER ABOUT HOW THAN. THEY'RE THE ONES BRING THAT FOR. THANK TO ME A CHURCH THAT WANTS TO REDUCE OR EVEN SHARE THE PARKING THAT THEY ACTUALLY USE ON A WEEKLY BASIS OR CLOSE TO A WEEKLY BASIS. ALWAYS WHEN WE'RE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT HOW THINGS. THEY'RE MORE FOCUSED THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER TOPIC ONE THING WELL WE NEED THIS MUCH PARKING WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT MUCH PARKING IS AVAILABLE FOR OUR FOLKS TO COME TO CHURCH- SO. EIGHT IT YET THEY ARE SO PROTECTIVE- AND IT'S JUST OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE HEAR THAT. OF THAT PARKING BUT THEN THE AFTER THE CHURCHES WE RUN INTO THAT HAVE PARKING THAT THEY JUST. DON'T EVER USE ARE THE YOU WANT THERE- EIGHTY WHY CAN'T WE SHOW THAT PART AND WITH RESIDENTS THE THAT WE COULD EITHER BUILD ON THAT SOME OF THAT. IN ORDER. ON DEVELOP AREA SHARE THAT PARKING YEAH THAT'S WHAT IT'S DOING ARE AND NOW. IN AND REASON WE CAME UP WITH THIS THE LOWEST BAY YEARS SIMPLY TO MAKING OF CASH. IT'S BECAUSE WITH THE A LOT OF THE ONE AND YES REDUCE THE CHURCHES THE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PARKING FOR THIR USE BUT THEY ARE. INTERESTED IN REDUCING ANY OF THAT PARKING THAT THEY HAVE. THANK THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL IN A FONG QUESTION- IS THERE AN OPT IN MECHANISM SO CITIES WHERE THEY WANT TO DO THIS CAN OPT IN. AND A SECOND OR THIRD QUESTION SORRY IS- IF THE PARKING AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS BEING COUNTED TOWARDS THE RELIGIOUS. USE PARKING DOES NOT REQUIRE THEM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE FOR THE BILL HOUSING ON THE SITES. TO BE A MEMBER OF THAT CONGREGATION OR- RELIGIOUSLY AFFILIATED WITH THAT CHURCH A PLACE OF WORSHIP. ALL ALL SO THIS IMMENSELY JEFF VAN ON THE FIRST QUESTION ANSWERED MOTORS ARE NOT BECAUSE- CITIES COULD EFFECTIVELY DO THAT RIGHT NOW THEY CAN WAS NOT THE PARKING REQUIREMENT IF THEY SEARCH YEARS- AND DAVIS DID THAT FOR EXAMPLE BUT IT TOOK FOUR YEARS- SO THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THEIR PARKING REQUIREMENTS TO DATE. AND SO THERE IS NO OPTION FOR THE BILL- AND COULD YOU WANT TO TACKLE THE SECOND QUESTION. I AM ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT- EVERY PROJECT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD YEAH BYE BYE FAIR HOUSING LAW% THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO DISCRIMINATION AND THAT HOUSING BASED ON RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION- WEEKLY A LOT OF. OUR KIDS WHO WANT TO HELP IN SOME CASES ONE HAVE PUBLICLY FUNDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOME CASES. GOING TO HAVE THAT TO MAKE SURE THEIR MEMBERS HAVE A CHANCE OF LIVING IN SOME OF THE UNITS- BUT- THIS IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE CHURCH IN IN A WAY- YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT- AND SO REALLY AGAIN IT. IT ONLY SHARING PARKING IN A WAY THAT'S REALLY GONNA WORK FOR THE CHURCH ASSUMING THAT THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY OVERLAP- BETWEEN THE RESIDENT. IN THE CHURCH GOERS SO QUESTION WITH WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOME OF THAT HAPPENED. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SAYING NONE OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE FOR SOLID DOES SOMETHING MEMBER WORKS WITH FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS.
