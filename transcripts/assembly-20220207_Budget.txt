AND WITH THAT THAT IS- THE END OF THE PRESENTATION- ON THE FIVE BILLS THANK. I THANK YOU HELLO. GOOD MORNING- CHAIR MEMBERS CAROLINE CHIU FROM LA- WE ARE HERE AND AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS COMMITTEE IN THE COMMENTS MR FALL. I THANK YOU AS CHAIR I'LL JUST RUN THROUGH ALL THE- THE BILL'S AND AS ALL MY QUESTIONS- THAT WAY- ON- STARTING WITH AB EIGHTY FOUR OR- SB ONE THIRTEEN- SO PRIOR TO RACE IT'S IN THIS DEPARTMENT FINANCE VIBRATIONS OF THIS- PAID SICK LEAVE WERE SUPPORTED BY FEDERAL TAX CREDITS- TO HELP EMPLOYERS. OFFSET THE COST OF ABSENT EMPLOYEES AND THAT FEDERAL TAX CREDIT HAS EXPIRED- IN THIS PROPOSAL IMPOSES A NEW PAID SICK LEAVE MANDATE- WITHOUT- THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT ON THE FEDERAL SIDE WITH THE STATE SIDE WAYS THEIR CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT PROVIDING THE STATE A STATE TAX CREDIT TO OFFSET THE COSTS. THANKS FOR BONTA ACQUISITION- IS SO YOU'RE RIGHT THIS THE CURRENT ITERATION OF PAID SICK LEAVE DOES NOT INCLUDE- AIMS. AT ITS THAT CREDIT WAS PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND NOT THE STATE IN THE PRIOR ITERATION- AND I THINK SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT- ARE ON THE TABLE ARE JUST THE DIFFICULT IN REGARDS IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL COSTS. SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT ROOTED IN THIS PROPOSAL BUT I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THSE ARE SOME ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION. WELL I THINK THAT'S THE BROADER QUESTION RIGHT I MEAN I'M A EMPLOYERS I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AS AS EMPLOYEES OF THE ON THE CRIME THE THAT THE WORKFORCE CHALLENGES- MEAN WAS WHAT WAS THE COST- IT WOULD IS IT WAS THERE AND ALICE'S SON ON. QUOTE UNQUOTE THE COSTS THE FED'S INCA ANCHORED THE PREFERRED THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PROTEST CREDIT. WHAT HOW MUCH THAT WAS AND COULD WE- DO THE SAME INVESTMENT IN THE STATE SIDE MADE WE HAVE THOSE NUMBERS KNOWLEDGE. SIGN ON THE COST TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS AS A RESULT OF THAT- TAX CREDIT. MAYBE I CAN AS THE L. A. L. IT WAS THERE WAS THERE DO YOU HAVE AN A AN ESTIMATE ON WHAT THE **** BUT THE FISCAL IMPACT WOULD BE A CREATING A STATE CREDIT HAD TO MAYOR THE FOR. THE EXPIRED FEDERAL CREDIT. YES IT YEAH IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM BUDGET STAFF WE DID PUT TOGETHER AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT A STATE TAX CREDIT. TO COVER THE COSTS- FACED Y EMPLOYERS COULD LOOK LIKE. I WILL NOTE THAT THE ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY- GIVEN THE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER AND I CAN GET SOME MILES ON JUST A SECOND. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES OVERALL ON. A STUDY OF WHAT THE FEDERAL. TAX CREDIT COSTS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. OUR ESTIMATES FOR THAT EIGHT TAX CREDIT AT THE STATE LEVEL- TO- STARTED BEING OF THE YEAR TO SEPTEMBER. COST BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE. IMPORTANTLY WE CREATED THESE. ESTIMATES BEFORE THE BILL WAS AND PRINT- AND SO THOSE THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT ALIGN PERFECTLY. WITH THE PARAMETERS OF THE BILL. ALSO NOTE THAT ARE ESTIMATES ARE CREDIT ON A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING HOW MANY EMPLOYERS- PROVIDED THE SICK LEAVE PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE BILL IN THERE FOR WOULD CLAIM. THE CREDIT DURING THE PEAK OF THE SEARCH. I IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY JUST I JANUARY- AND ALSO DEPENDENT ON. IF YOU READ HISTORY AT PRECEDING THE REST OF THE YEAR SO IT SO IT IS QUITE VARIABLE BUT SAID TO SUM UP WE DID WE DID RUN LAST NIGHT AND- CAME UP WITH BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION MONTHLY FOR BILLIONS. SO GOING BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET THIS CORRECTLY RIGHT LEG WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING THE RANGERS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO ONE POINT FOUR BILLION- THAT COSTS WOULD BE INCURRED BY. EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA WITH NO OFFSET. HAVING NOT SEEN THE L. A. ANALYSIS I'M I AM NOT SURE I CAN RESPOND TO THAT I THINK THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF VARIABLES TO BE CONSIDERED. SHE STATED- AND SO THE POTENTIAL CHANGE COULD BE QUITE HIGH. WELL OKAY LOOK LET'S JUST LET'S JUST MAKE THE TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY WITHOUT THERE IS NO FEDERAL TAX CREDIT YOU STIPULATED THAT. SO THE COST OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE BORNE BY. BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WITH NO OFFSET WHAT. SO THE BUSINESS'S BLADE BEAR THAT I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THERE ARE THERE IS AN EXCEPTION INCLUDED IT WAS ALL PART IN PLAYERS WITH UNDER- TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES AND I WOULD ALSO POINT TO MANY. SUPPORTS THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED AT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO BUSINESS. INCLUDED IT'S UP SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE EARLY ACTION AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR HAS STATED THAT WE WILL CONTINUE. TO LOOK FOR OTHER WAYS IN WHICH SUPPORTS BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY COULD BE NINETEEN. SHE WELL I MEAN IF THE L. L. I KNOW WE'RE JUST DISPUTING THAT THE NUMBERS BUT THE ALEJO'S ANALYSIS WAS ON WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS OF THE EXEMPTION YOU WHAT WHERE YOU GUYS ARE EXTENDING- THE PREVIOUS IMAGE BASE IT IS IT IS THE EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS- BILL THAT WAS DONE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT EXEMPTION ORDER EXISTS SO WHATEVER CAUGHT SO WHATEVER COST WAS INCURRED. IN THE PREVIOUS BILL WOULD BE INCURRED AGAIN BUT WOULD NOW WOULD KNOW OFFSET- THAT IS CORRECT AND AGAIN I WOULD POINT TO SOME OF THE OTHER SUPPORTS ARE OUTSIDE. I'M THAT WE ARE PROVIDING TO SMALL BUSINESSES BUT YES THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. I WAS ONE MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE FUTURE OR THE OTHER OR TAX RELIEF IS APPLES TO ORANGES RIGHT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT RELATED TO- THE OFFSET OF THE COSTS. BUT JUMPING TO- BUT BEFORE TO TALK ON THIS TOPIC I THINK- WHEN THE SPEAKER THE PRO TEM THE GOVERNOR SHOULD STATEMENT- YOU KNOW WE AGREE WITH YOUR- YOUR OINT AND WE THINK THAT. AS PART OF OUR JUNE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT. SOME POTENTIAL GRANTS OR TAX RELIEF I IN PARTICULAR FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE WE ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THOSE BUSINESSES SO I THINK THAT- WHILE THAT'S NOT IN THIS PACKAGE I THINK THE ASSEMBLY DEFINITELY. I WANT TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION IN THE JUNE DISCUSSIONS- ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO HAVING A VERY. SPECIFIC FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMISSION THIS YEAR I THINK- HE ACKNOWLEDGES AS WELL AS I THAT WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE PERSEVERING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC IS THAT. WE'RE PLACING THE SECTOR THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS PLACING MORE BURDENS ON THEM AND THIS IS- A SIGNIFICANT COST BURDEN THAT IT HAS NO OFFSET AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M TYING TO. TO FLUSH OUT- IN MY QUESTIONING SO I BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT- SEARCHER. JUMPING TO- A ADS. SEVEN AND I'M AB EIGHTY FOUR AND OF THE- I WAS EIGHTY SEVEN THE ECONOMIC RELIEF- THE PANDEMIC RELIEF- TO THE FORMER FINANCE I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ISN'T A FULL CONFORMITY WHEN IT COMES TO- THE SHATTERED VENUES GRANT PROGRAM. AS WELL AS- OTHER PROGRAMS WITH- WITHIN THE PPP PROGRAM- SPECIFICALLY THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION. LOOK FOR PROGRAM LOANS AFTER MARCH THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION OF WHY THERE ISN'T- FULL CONFORMITY WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE PROGRAMS A NOTE THAT THAT- THAT GAP HAS COME TO OUR ATTENTION RECENTLY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN. DISCUSSING IT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS EARLY ACTION BUT- WE ARE AWARE OF THAT ISSUE OF ACTION IN THE FUTURE OF ADDRESSING THAT GAP SO THAT THERE IS- FOR CONFORMITY MY CONCERN IS THAT- WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS. DONE BY THE MARCH FIFTEENTH FILING OF TAXES BY BY A LOT OF OUR- VENUES AND BUSINESSES SO ITI JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE- WEAR A KNOWLEDGE AND THAT THERE IS A TIME A TIMING ISSUE. YES AGAIN THAT THAT IS MORE MORE RECENTLY BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WILL BRING IT BACK TO. DISK PROPER DISCUSSIONS OKAY ON AB ONE FORTY SEVEN- THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. FUNDS GOING TO- PREVIOUSLY- APPROVE CONTRACTS WELL THERE PROCEED NO BID CONTRACTS- WHAT. WHAT IS THE PRIMARY FINANCE DOING WHAT CAR REALIZE YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT EFFECTIVELY. MR GOING ARE YOU SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A PARTICULAR CONTRACT. SUSPENSION VALENCIA LAPS AND THE TO R. SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO OPERATE THAT I'M ASSUMING THAT SOME OF THE COVERT RELIEF- FUNDING REQUESTED BY THE MINISTRATION IS TO GO TO FIND THAT CONTRACT TO CONTINUE TO FIND THAT CONTRACT- THAT IS CORRECT- AT THE VOLUNTEER CONTRACTED. I WOULD- POINT OUT A FORTY FIVE DAY CLOUDS AND- YEAH BUT EVERY EVERY IF- THAT VENDOR-IS FOUND TO BE NOT PERFORMING THE STATE HAS A RIGHT TO TERMINATE THAT CONTRACT WITH FORTY FIVE DAY NOTICE I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT THERE THAT IS A GUARD RAIL- LIKE MANY CONTRACTS AT THE STATE- PROCURE IS. THERE ARE- PROTECTIONS SO THAT THE STATE IS THAT HELD LIABLE FOR- ISSUES WITH THE VENDOR THAT IS JUST ONE THING. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT- IT'S NOT MY AND AS WELL THAT THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS- GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN REGARDS TO OTHER CONTRACTS SO JUST POINT THAT OUT. SO THEN HOW DOES HOW DOES THE- PART OF THOSE- GUARDRAILS OPERATE DOES THE THERE'S A DEPARTMENT THEY NOTIFY YOU THAT EVERY FORTY FIVE DAYS OR I'M JUST I UNDERSTAND LIKE. WHAT THIS THIS ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS. PUSH FOR THIS PROCESS- THE MOVING TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR THIS VERY REASON RIGHT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENCY AND HOW WE- HELL OUT THESE FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED NOW THEY'RE BEING USED AND WHETHER THEY'RE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY. AND WE'RE NOT USING THE OTHER PROCESSES THAT WERE DONE- DURING THE PANDEMIC SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I OF THE ONE POINT NINE MILLION. AND THAT IS WITH A B. WICKS WHAT CHECK WHAT GUARDRAILS THERE ARE THERE TO ENSURE THAT. IT'S NOT BEING WASTED. I'M SURE IN REGARDS TO PROCESS I WILL TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES- FOR SOME DETAILS. NOVATEL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION BUT TO JUST REITERATE MISLEADS POINT TO THERE ARE SPECIFIC GUARDRAILS WITHIN THE CONTRACTS THAT ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO. CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING OTHER LABORATORIES INCLUDING THE UC SYSTEM. FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN TIMES WHEN WE NEED TO RAPIDLY INCREASE OUR TESTING AND AS A PATH EVENTUAL RELEASE FILES IN THE EVENT WE DO UP TO TERMINATE OUR CONTRACT WITH- THE VALENCIA BRANDS LAB. OKAY BUT YOU'RE- YOU'RE GIVING ME FUTURE ACTIONS BUT WE'RE FINDING SOMETHING NOW. SO WHAT IS THE ONE POINT NINE BILLION BEING USED FOR. SO THE ONE POINT NINE BILLION IS- AND LET ME JUST POINT OUT THAT WE ARE BRINGING THIS BEFORE YOU AS PART OF A BUDGET PROCESS THAT IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH- WHAT THAT YOUR MENTION WAS A DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT- OR THROUGH. JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET LETTER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE- MIGHT TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THEREFORE GOING TO THE BUDGET PROCESS- BUT IN REGARDS TO THE ONE POINT NINE BILLION- IT IS LARGELY- THREE DEPARTMENTS- I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION- AND MUCH OF THAT IS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CONTACT TRACING HOSPITAL MEDICAL SEARCH OUR OWN STATE OPERATIONS. STATE WRESTING VACCINE DISTRIBUTION- SUPPORT FOR VULNERABLE POPULATION SO THAT'S THE LARGEST CHUNK OF THE ONE POINT BILLION- ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED. FOR THE CORRECTIONS THE OF CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION LARGELY FOR TESTING BOTH OF- CRASHED INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AS- AND THEN THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION ON TOP OF THAT FOR THE OPERATION- THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY- SERVICES AND THAT IS LARGELY FOR P. P. SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE SPECIFIC. CATEGORIES OF FUNDING THAT REQUIRE QUESTING THAT IS IN ADDITION TO THE ONE POINT FOUR FIVE- ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION THAT WAS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND I JUST- I THINK PROVES THE POINT OF HOW- HOW MUCH ALL RIGHT WE DIDN'T KNOW ADD TO THAT THE THAT BUDGET ACTS IN JULY WHEN- THE BILL WHEN IT TOOK. ADULTO WAS NOT THE MAY HAVE BEEN ON HER EYES ON THE CRIME WAS NOT RESPONSE. PUBLIC HEALTH. IN IT- THAT HAVE LARGELY BEEN- EXPANDED TO MORE INDIVIDUALS AND WE NEED FOR THE SUPPORT FOR OUR VACCINE EFFORTS. WELL IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US WITH THAT LINE ITEM I'D- SPECIFICALLY MAY I KNOW YOU GIVEN HAS BROUGHT BUCKETS BUT IF THERE'S A LINE ITEM THAT YOU CAN GIVE US I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT% I'VE I'VE BLOOD THE CHAIR FROM MAKING THIS MAKING. THIS PROPOSAL GO TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN GET THOSE DETAILS I THINK THAT'S THE VERY- THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR- THESE PROPOSALS TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING INTO IT ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT HAVE GONE INTO NO BID CONTRACTS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE GUARDRAILS ARE YOU MENTION CARD REELS PLURAL BUT YOU ONLY MENTION ONE GUARDRAIL WHICH IS THE FORTY FIVE DAY REVIEW SO THERE ARE OTHER GUARDRAILS WE CERTAINLY LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THOSE ARE- IN TERMS. OF THE- THAT THE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY WILL- THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ENSURE THESE- THIRTY THESE FOR THIRTY MEGAWATT GENERATORS THAT WERE PURCHASED MEET- AIR QUALITY STANDARDS- I GUESTS IS TO SAVE THE THIRTY MILLION WOULD AND IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO HAVE THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL. I HAVE THE STATE ASK FOR THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WAIVE- OR WAVE OR ALLOW THESE- TO GET SOME WAIVERS TO IT TO ENSURE THAT THESE MEGA WATT GENERATORS ON COMPLIANCE. YEAH FOR MORE SPECIFICS I'M NOT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG I WILL TURN OVER TO A COLLEAGUE. YEAH GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS- THIRTY RATHER PART OF FINANCE AT THOUGH REALLY KIND OF THE CARD GENERATOR IF YOU NATURAL GAS. AS THOUGH. IT PORTANTINO THAT YOU KIND OF ONE OF THE KEY GOALS. WHEN WE PUT THE GENERATOR PRETTY EMERGENT DURING THE SUMMER- WE RECEIVED A WAIVER I'VE BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE. HI I GOOD THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GENERATORS- WE'RE KIND OF UP TO CODE IN TERMS OF MEETING ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS THOUGH I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL PREVENTATIVE TO AIR POLLUTION NAY AND THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THOSE GENERATORS ARE. AT THE BY INSTALLING THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT ON THE GENERATOR TO. HELP THE POOR- OUT OF THEIR MEETING AIR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO- BE CREATING ANY KIND OF AIR. I WILL REFRAIN MY RHETORICAL QUESTION ABOUT WHY IN A TIME OF CRISIS THE GOVERNOR WHILE CRITIQUING NATURAL GAS IS BUYING NATURAL GAS GENERATORS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY BUT- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT- THERE AND THAT. YOU COULD JUST ASK FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE WAIVERS AND- SAVE THE STATE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- JUMPING TO- ACTUALLY WITH THE LAST QUESTION ON ON THIS BILL IS THE CREATION OF THIS CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY RELIEF FUND. IS THERE A REASON WHY WE'RE CREATING A NEW PHONE AND INSTEAD OF JUST USING THE EXISTING FUNDS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY RELIEF WHY WHY CREATE THIS NEW RELIEF FUND. SURE THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE RELIEF FUND THAT WAS CREATED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET OF THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET- FOR THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS FUND. AND- YOU KNOW THAT FUND WAS WAS CREATED FOR A MARGIN SEE RELIEF RELATED EXPENSES- AND THERE WERE PROVISIONS AROUND THAT SO. IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE NECESSARILY TO USE THAT SAME EMERGENCY FUND BUT SIMILAR TO THAT INSTANCE WE'RE BEING CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW AND THAT ACTIVITY FROM LAST YEAR AND REALLY TRYING TO. CREATE WE CREATED THIS EMERGENCY FUND FOR EMERGENCY RELATED- ACTIVITIES. SELECT YOUR C. Y. JUST. ALLOCATED OTHER GENERAL FUND WHY CREATE EMERGENCY FUND AT ALL. HE TRACKED THE MONEY EITHER WAY WHETHER IT COMES FROM THE FUND OR THE GENERAL FUND WHY NOT JUST ALLOCATED ON THE GENERAL FUND. SURE AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ACTIONS THAT- WE TOOK LAST YEAR THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL LEGISLATURE UP STARTLED THE LEGISLATURE AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED LAST YEAR SO I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT AND WE HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT THAT THIS COULD BE- IT SOUNDS LITTLE. EXCLUDABLE AS WELL. SO YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE THESE FUNDS FROM. THE CELL YEAH LIMIT- THAT'S A POSSIBILITY. THAT COULD BENEFIT- THE STATE IF THESE FUNDS ARE PROVIDED THROUGH AN EMERGENCY ACCOUNT. SO WHY WOULD YOU WANT IT EXCLUDED- AT. IT IS IT ACTUALLY IS EXCLUDED FROM THAT- THE STATE'S- ALLOCATIONS AND THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE AGAIN LIMITS. BUT AGAIN WELL WHEN YOU SAY BENEFIT I MADE THE IF IT'S OVER THE GAMUT WE WOULD ARGUE THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN BACK RIGHT SO IF YOU EXCLUDE IT THAT MEANS THAT MONEY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE GIVEN BACK. TO THE TO THE STATE TAXPAYERS OR TO. OTHER INVESTMENTS. YES AND I WOULD JUST GET HIGHLIGHTED THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DID LAST YEAR SO IT'S CONSISTENT WITH. BUT CURRENT LAW AND THE ACTIONS THAT- THIS MARCH OF LAST YEAR. BUT OKAY WELL IT'S GETTING IT'S CONSISTENT I FIND IT I OPENING THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN SOMETHING FOR YOU TRYING TO CREATE A FUND TO EXCLUDED OUT OF SOMETHING THAT. PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE EXCLUDED- AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION MOVING TO- AB ONE THIRTY NINE- IS- HOW MAY OF UP. FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WILL NOW BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE- THE FEDERAL GRANT FUNDING- FOR REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT ASSISTANCE. AND HOW WITH THE- NONPROFITS IN COUNTIES BE PRIORITIZED FOR THIS FUNDING. YES CAN I TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO A COLLEAGUE. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MR FONG THIS IS NOT A CLASSY- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS YOU NOTED THE LANGUAGE REQUIRES THAT THE DEPARTMENT TO- PRIORITIZE COUNTY NONPROFITS IN THIS ALLOCATION OF FUNDS- THIS IS YOU KNOW CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS APPROACH TO THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY IN PLACE- WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC CENTRO NUMBER OF FOR PROFIT PROVIDERS OR- ABOUT AND WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND DETAILS OKAY WELL YOU SAID THERE'S PRIORITIZATION SO HOW HOW YOU. ARE YOU PRIORITIZING. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON HOW THE DEPARTMENT WOULD IMPLEMENT THAT PRIORITIZATION. BUT WE'RE VOTING ON THIS BILL ON MONDAY OR NOT- TODAY I MADE HER VOTING ON THIS WE WERE BEFORE VOTING ON THIS BILL AND THAT COUPLE HOURS- HOW ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME IN ADVANCE. AFTER I BILL ON THE BILL. FINALLY WELL IT'S TIME TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IN THE END IN FACT DURING THIS YEAR I WILL BE TRYING TO GET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION OKAY I. I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE CONVERSATION BUT IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING THAT. WHERE WERE HEARING THESE BILLS AND WE'RE VOTING THEM ON TODAY BUT WE CAN'T GET ANY DETAILS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHO SUPPOSEDLY NEGOTIATED THESE BILLS. AND SO THAT IS A BROADER POINT I WOULD MAKE ON THE PROCESS IS THAT. WE MAKE DECISIONS ON IN PERFECT INFORMATION ALL THE TIME YOU'RE JUST NOT GIVING US ANY INFORMATION AND THAT'S A PROBLEM. THAT WAS FOR SURE THE NAME OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. NOT NOT SEEING ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OKAY LET'S GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE PLEASE- TAKES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WE HAVE THE MICHAEL PLEASE. SEVEN THERE WE GO. NO NO WITH THIS MICROPHONE ON. YES GOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS ARE A PART OF MARTINEZ WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION- HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL'S AROUND COVERT SICK LEAVE- A. B.

I ALSO THINK THIS COMMITTEE FOR THEIR ATTENTION THIS AND PARTICULARLY- SOME OF WOMAN CARILLO FOR HER HELP AND GUIDANCE AND NEVER GETTING THIS ISSUE I THINK SO MUCH WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO THE NEXT BIGGER. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD TO SEE HIM AT CERTAIN THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY SEVEN IN PARTICULAR WITH REGARD TO THE- RESTAURANT RIVER REVITALIZATION FUNDS. THOSE WERE REALLY LIFELINE FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- TO HELP OFFSET FOR THE GOVERNMENT ORDERED CLOSURES OF RESTAURANTS. AND SO ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THOSE WERE NEVER INTENDED- ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS TO BE TAXED AS INCOME THIS ENSURES THAT THEY WON'T. AND THEN THE OTHER THING JUST TO KEEP IN MIND IS THOSE REALLY FUNDS WENT 2404% OF CALIFORNIA'S QUALIFIED RESTAURANTS SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS DIDN'T GET THAT RELIEF BUT FOR THOSE THAT DID THE LUCKY ONES. THIS IS THE TIPPING POINT PROBABLY FOR WHETHER THEY CAN REMAIN A VIABLE EMPLOYER OR NOT SO WE ARE GREAT SUPPORT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN FIRST CHRISTMAS CEILIDH ON BEHALF OF THE HOLLYWOOD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE THANKFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR AB EIGHTY SEVEN AND ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT FIRST THAT YOU ELIMINATE THE THIRD YEAR OF THE CAP ON THE USE OF BUSINESS TAX CREDITS AND THE SUSPENSION OF THE NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTION AND SECONDLY THE CONFORMITY NOT JUST ON THE RESTAURANT REVITALIZATION FUND BUT ALSO ON THE SHUTTERED VENUE PROVIDER TAX CONFORMITY AS WELL.

PUTTING THE HEALTH OF. EVERYDAY PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND JEOPARDY AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS AS WE TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT ALL OF US. AND I THINK WE'VE COME TO A GOOD- THE GOOD PLACE- ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL WO NEED A LOT OF SUPPORT TO MAINTAIN. OTHER BUSINESSES OPEN AND FOR THE MOST PART WE ALL AGREE ARE THE- BACKBONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES WE THINK ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES AND HOW. THEY'RE ABLE TO LOCALLY EMPLOYED PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES. NO ONE NO WORKER WHETHER IN A LARGE BUSINESS OR SMALL BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE. THE REALLY TOUGH DECISION OF EITHER. GOING TO WORK SICK- AND JEOPARDIZING THEIR OWN HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF THEIR COWORKERS OR AT NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THEIR RENT AS SCHOOLS HAVE REOPENED CHILDREN ARE ALSO. AT PLAY HERE WITH MANY KIDS COMING HOME TESTING% POSITIVE AND PARENTS HAVING TO MAKE. THE VERY DIFFICULT- CHOICES OF HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES THEMSELVES AND ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO. LIVE IN INDIGNITY PAY THEIR RENT TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE AND TRY TO SURVIVE WE HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED THAT AND WE KNOW THAT COLD THAT HAS HIT. DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES LOW WAGE WORKERS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HAVE SUFFERED THE MOST ACROSS THE STATE- WE HAVE FELT THAT AND SO I THINK THAT WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT CAME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS- IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO ENSURE THAT. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BUT ALSO NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT HAVE THAT AND TO- THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION'S POINT FIGURE OUT A WAY IN WHICH WE SUPPORT- THE RESTAURANT IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE ALL LOVE. AND THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY OPEN THEY CONTINUE TO EMPLOY. AND THAT ULTIMATELY PUT PEOPLE FIRST SO THAT NO ONE HAS TO MAKE A DECISION.
