00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.248
APPROPRIATE AND AFTER

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.551
RESOUNDING WORDS IN SUPPORT OF

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.253

WE LEARN FROM THESE REMOTE

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.834
APPEARANCES SOME OF THE RESULTS

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.335
WE EXPECTED SOMEWHERE

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:53.306
UNEXPECTED. THE HUGE BENEFIT IS

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:55.942
ACCESS TO OUR COURTS REMOTE

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:57.977
APPEARANCES PROVIDED TIMELY

00:07:58.044 --> 00:08:00.313
CONVENIENT COURT ACCESS TO

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.715
LITIGANTS WITHOUT THE NEED TO

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:05.051
TRAVEL TO A COURTHOUSE ACROSS

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:08.187
TOWN. ROSS THE COUNTY WITHOUT

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:10.223
THE NEED TO TRANSFER ON BUSES

WORK OR SECURE CHILD CARE OR

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:18.698
DEPENDENT CARE WHICH IS

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.800
EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT DURING

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.468
THESE CHALLENGING TIMES THAT WE

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:25.438
HAVE BEEN FACING. IN ADDITION.

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:28.074
IT ENABLED ATTORNEYS TO APPEAR

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.609
IN MULTIPLE CASES IN MULTIPLE

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.477
JURISDICTIONS UP AND DOWN THE

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:34.113
STATE WITH REDUCED COSTS TO

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.082
THEIR CLIENT BECAUSE THEY TOO

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:37.416
DID NOT HAVE TO TRAVEL TO

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:39.051
DIFFERENT COURT LOCATIONS AND

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:40.887
DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT. IN COURT

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.688
ROOMS UNTIL THEIR CASES WERE

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.824
READY TO BE CALL. BUT THERE

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.325
WERE ALSO ON THE INTENDED

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:48.160
CONSEQUENCES. WHAT WE

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:50.830
DISCOVERED WAS IN HIGH CONFLICT

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:53.566
AREAS IN PARTICULAR AREAS LIKE

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:54.467
FAMILY LAW AND RESTRAINING

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:56.335
ORDERS REMOTE APPEARANCES

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:59.005
ACTUALLY REDUCED THE CONFLICT

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.173
LEVEL IT REDUCED THE LEVEL OF

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.009
TENSION. BECAUSE PEOPLE WEREN'T

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:04.944
AFRAID OF COMING INTO COURT

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.446
PHYSICALLY AND SITTING ACROSS

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:09.982
CAN'T BE AND AN AGGRESSOR

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.684
RENDON SALAS. NOW THERE'S BEEN

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:12.985
SOME SUGGESTION THAT REMOTE

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.153
APPEARANCES CREATE

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.023
OPPORTUNITIES TO PERSUADE OR

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.391
INFLUENCE WITNESSES ON

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:20.693
APPROPRIATELY. UNFORTUNATELY

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.761
THE REALITY OF COURT LIFE IS

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:22.962
THESE OPPORTUNITIES ALWAYS

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.264
EXIST NOW AS JUDGES WE ARE

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:27.266
TRAINED TO INVESTIGATE YOUR

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:28.634
WEEKEND TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.203
CORPORATE SEEDINGS ARE FAIR AND

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:31.804
SECURE FROM THOSE

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:34.774
OPPORTUNITIES. BUT WE CAN'T SEE

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.309
WHO'S DRIVING A WITNESS TO

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.311
COURT ON ANY GIVEN DAY WHETHER

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:39.512
OR NOT THERE'S AN INFLUENTIAL

00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:41.647
PARTY WAITING FOR THEM OUTSIDE

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.416
OR OTHERWISE PRESENTING ANY

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:46.819
KIND OF THREAT DIRECTOR REPLIED.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:50.156
IN FACT REMOTE APPEARANCES IN

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.724
CONTRAST WITH TELEPHONIC

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:53.326
APPEARANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:56.262
AVAILABLE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.631
PROVIDE A GREATER OPPORTUNITY

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:01.100
FOR COURTS TO SEE IF THERE IS

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.636
AN INAPPROPRIATE EFFORT TO

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:07.239
INFLUENCE A WITNESS. IN REALITY

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:08.774
THESE REMOTE APPEARANCES HAVE

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:12.511
GIVEN US TRUER TESTIMONY OR AT

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:15.047
LEAST AS TRUE TESTIMONY. AND

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.782
BOTH THE JUDGES THE ATTORNEYS

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:18.951
THE PARTIES AND HE LITIGANTS

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.720
HAVE CORRESPONDINGLY BENEFIT.

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.388
IN ADDITION IN PARTICULARLY

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.990
SENSITIVE AREAS THINGS LIKE

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.424
JUVENILE CASE TYPES OR

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:27.226
COLLABORATIVE COURTS WE'VE

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.594
DISCOVERED THAT REMOTE

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:31.564
APPEARANCES AGAIN IMPROVED THE

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.000
COR INTERACTION. THEY ENABLE

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:35.701
THESE MINOR CHILDREN THEY

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:37.336
ENABLE THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:38.471
ARE GOING THROUGH THE TREATMENT

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:41.240
PROCESS TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOME

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.509
OR WORK OR TREATMENT SETTINGS

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:46.612
SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP UP AND ON

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.314
INTERRUPTED CONTINUUM OF CARE.

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.049
IN ADDITION FOR MANY WHO ARE

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.117
SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:53.085
ISSUES PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.154
OR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS COMING

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:56.188
TO COURT ITSELF CAN BE A

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:57.757
TRIGGERING EXPERIENCE THAT CAN

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:00.026
SET BACK. IN THEIR RECOVERY

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:02.328
EFFORTS REMOTE APPEARANCES

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:03.562
REMOVED THAT TRIGGERING

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:05.698
EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT BRINGS

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:08.467
THE COURT TO THE INDIVIDUAL. WE

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:10.536
ARE ABLE TO MEET INDIVIDUALS

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:12.571
WHERE THEY ARE IN WAYS THAT WE

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:15.441
WERE NEVER ABLE TO DO BEFORE.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.675
AND FINALLY ONE ADDITIONAL

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:19.445
HUGELY IMPORTANT AREA. IS OUR

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.714
JURORS WILL LOVE IT. WE HAVE

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:23.282
BEEN ABLE TO REACH MORE JURORS

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.984
IN MORE AREAS OF THE COUNTY

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:26.886
BECAUSE THEY TOO DON'T HAVE

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:28.287
THEIR LIVES TO SUBSTANTIALLY

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:30.189
INTERRUPTED AS THEY TRAVEL TO

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.224
COURT REQUIRES THEM TO DO. THEY

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.659
WILLINGLY AND ACTIVELY

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.594
PARTICIPATE IN THESE REMOTE

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:37.897
JURY TRIALS AND IN FACT TALK

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:39.065
VERY FAVORABLY ABOUT THE

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:41.000
PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE WHERE

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.768
EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PLAYING

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:43.969
FIELD ASSUMING A BASE

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:46.005
TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM. AND HAS

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.206
THE OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW THE

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:48.841
WITNESSES AND THE EVIDENCE IN

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:51.043
THE SAME WAY SOMETHING THAT THE

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.578
LAY OUT OF OUR OLD PHYSICAL

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:55.514
COURTROOM SIMPLY DON'T AFFORD.

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:57.616
NOW WE ALL KNOW THE COURTS THE

00:11:57.683 --> 00:11:58.851
LEGAL SYSTEM OVERALL IN THE

00:11:58.918 --> 00:11:59.919
COURTS IN PARTICULAR CAN BE

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.954
SLOW TO IMPLEMENT CHANGE AND

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:02.922
THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:04.924
FORCED THIS IMPLEMENTATION AT A

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.126
MUCH MORE RAPID RATE. THAN ANY

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:09.028
OF US WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED.

00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:10.563
BUT THE RESULTS AS I SAY HAVE

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:14.100
BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL.

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:16.302
AND OUR PEOPLE THE MEMBERS OF

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:17.636
OUR COMMUNITY HAVE CONSISTENTLY

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:20.039
ASKED PLEASE KEEP THESE REMOTE

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:22.441
OPPORTUNITIES OPEN. BECAUSE OF

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:24.009
THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO JUSTICE

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.744
THAT IT AFFORDS. NOW THERE'S

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.046
SOME SUGGESTION AS TO WHETHER

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.347
OR NOT A PILOT MIGHT BE

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:32.017
APPROPRIATE OR SOME KIND OF LOS.

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:35.387
IN OUR POSITION. THIS PAST YEAR

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.756
HAS BEEN OUR PILOT. AND ANY

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:38.891
KIND OF PAUSE WOULD

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.659
UNFORTUNATELY NEGATIVELY AFFECT

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:41.994
THE LITIGANTS AND THE MEMBERS

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:43.729
OF OUR PUBLIC WHO WE ARE VERY

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.698
MUCH TRYING TO SEARCH YOUR

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.800
SERVICE IS ESSENTIAL TO IN

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.902
THESE VERY DIFFICULT TIMES. AND

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:51.437
SO IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.472
WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE TRAILER

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:55.641
BILL LANGUAGE AND LEGISLATION

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:56.475
THAT WOULD FURTHER PROMOTE

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.611
REPORT HE WON THE APPEARANCES

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:00.746
AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:03.582
ACCESS TO OUR COMMUNITY THAT

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:05.151
THESE SERVICES PROVIDE. NOW I

WITH US TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.222

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:16.729
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE I

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.197
THINK THE JUDGE DOES THAT TELL

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:20.266
FOR. ARM HER BACKGROUND BUT I

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:20.866

COMMENTS. ANNUALLY WITH THE

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE-

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:50.796
SO IN LOOKING AT THE PROPOSED

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:53.432
LANGUAGE- WE DID THINK THAT

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.733
BEAT WE DID FIND THAT THE

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.135
EXPANSION OF REMOTE PROCEEDINGS

00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:57.603
DOESN'T MERIT LEGISLATIVE

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.705
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE OF THE

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:01.941
POTENTIAL BENEFITS RELATED TO

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.475
INCREASING EQUITY AND ACCESS TO

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:05.611
THE COURTS REDUCING LITIGATION

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.413
COSTS THAT USERS ARE GOING TO

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:09.348
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY. AND

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.649
HELPING TO PROCESS CASES MORE

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:13.786
COST EFFECTIVELY HOWEVER- WE

00:14:13.852 --> 00:14:15.854
DID NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.289
WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:18.624
REMOTE PROCEEDINGS WOULD BE

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.993
APPROPRIATE FOR USE IN ALL CASE

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.195
TYPES OR PROCEEDINGS. OR

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:24.463
WHETHER STATE LAW SHOULD

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:25.598
INCLUDE CERTAIN MINIMUM

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:27.833
STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT USERS

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:41.213
ACROSS THE STATE ARE. HAVING

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.714
SIMILAR EXPERIENCES. IN

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.381
ADDITION I WE FOR THAT PROPOSAL

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:43.549
LINE LACKS SPECIFIC AND USED TO

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:45.317
SIGNIFY EMPLOYEE. DETAILS TO

AGENDA. REMOTE PROCEEDINGS OF

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.094
FOR EXAMPLE WOULD IT BE

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.629
REQUIRED OR NOT. ANOTHER

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:57.963
QUESTION IS HOW WOULD COURT

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.599
PROCESS THESE CHANGE SO WHAT

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:01.500
WOULD BE THE RULES FOR

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:02.868
PROVIDING NOTICE IF YOU DIDN'T

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:03.869
WANT TO IF YOU'RE REMOTELY WHAT

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:05.604
WOULD BE THE RULES FOR REMOTE

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.706
DURING TRIALS SIX CETERA. AND

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:08.674
THE THIRD QUESTION LAID OUT

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:11.176
THERE IS WOOD FAIRNESS EQUITY

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.045
PRIVACY AND PUBLIC ACCESS

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:15.147
ISSUES BE ADDRESSED AND IN WHAT

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:17.349
MANNER SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.752
WOULD INDIVIDUALS BE ABLE TO

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:22.054
CHOOSE. HER SENTENCE OR WHAT

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.590
WITH THAT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE.

00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:26.125
IN TURN BECAUSE THERE IS THIS

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:27.493
LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:29.295
IT ALSO MEANS THAT THE IMPACTS

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.530
ON TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.399
PROCESSES AND COSTS ARE

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.801
CURRENTLY UNKNOWN BUT COULD BE

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.736
SIGNIFICANT. AND SO THE UNKNOWN

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:39.338
IMPACTS INCLUDE HOW MUCH

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:41.340
ADDITIONAL ONE TIME OR ONGOING

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:42.975
TECHNOLOGY RELATED COSTS WOULD

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.811
BE NEEDED. WHAT THE NET IMPACT

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.513
ON CORE OPERATIONS COST AND

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.415
WORKLOAD WOULD BE. THE NET

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.150
IMPACT ON CIVIL RELATED COURT

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:52.584
REVENUES THAT CURRENTLY SUPPORT

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:55.220
TRUCK OR OPERATIONS. AS WELL AS

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:59.892
THE IMPACT ON. FACILITY ONLINE

00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.528
AND WHY OF THE WE HAVE RECORD.

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:04.763
OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION AS WE

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.564
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:06.965
DIRECTS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.168
SUBMIT A DETAILED PLAN FOR HOW

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:10.703
REMOTE PROCEEDINGS WILL BE

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.604
IMPLEMENTED BY CASE AND OR

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:14.373
PROCEEDING TYPE. THIS TYPE OF

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.908
PLAN WHICH WOULD ADDRESS THOSE

00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:17.976
KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS THAT

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.511
I BROUGHT UP WOULD HELP THE

00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:21.246
LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHETHER

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:32.024
AND. HOW TO MODIFY THE PROPOSED

00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:32.658
LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT THE OF

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:34.360
HER CHRISSY WERE FOR WHAT PRIOR.

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:37.062
SUCH AS ON STANDARD. OR A USE

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:39.298
IN CERTAIN CASE TYPE OR- AND

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:43.001
PUTTING THAT IN STATE. THE

00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:43.902
SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS IF THE-

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:46.271
WHY TO MOVE FORWARD. FOR ANY

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:47.673
PLAN IS RISK. UNDER THAT'S WE

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.741
WOULD RUN THAT THE LET. PILOT

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.008
REMOTE PROCEED FOR TWO YEARS.

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:50.943
AND THE LAST. CASE TYPES

00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:52.277
PROCEEDING SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:54.513
INFRACTIONS ARE SMALL PLANES

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.814
AND REQUIRE AN EVALUATION BY

00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:57.916
NOVEMBER FIRST TWO TWENTY

00:16:57.983 --> 00:16:59.518
TWENTY TWO. AND SO THE PILOT

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:00.919
AND THE EVALUATION WITH THEN

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:02.988
INFORM LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS ON

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:05.290
WHETHER TO EXTEND EXPAND OR

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:06.959
MODIFY THE AUTHORIZATION ONCE

00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:09.027
THE PILOT ENDS. AND SO THIS

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:10.763
TYPE OF APPROACH WOULD ALLOW

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.398
FOR IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES TO BE

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:14.466
IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED IN

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.502
AREAS THAT HAVE LESS IMPACT ON

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:17.903
COURTNEY'S OUR LIVES BEFORE

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.305
BEING EXPANDED TO MORE COMPLEX

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:24.276
CASE TYPES. AND PROCEEDINGS AS-A MORE MEASURED APPROACH WOULD

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.778
HELP MINIMIZE UNINTENDED

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:29.948
CONSEQUENCES. AND COSTS. THE

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:30.816
FINAL COMMENT THAT WE WOULD

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.918
PROVIDE IS THAT WE ARE AWARE.

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:33.385
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:34.553
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.921
JUDICIAL BRANCH OF LEGISLATIVE

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.523
STAFF ON THE LANGUAGE OVER THE

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:38.390
PAST COUPLE MONTHS SINCE

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:40.125
LANGUAGE HAS BEEN INTRODUCED.

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.460
AND SO DEPENDING ON LEGISLATORS

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:43.295
GOALS THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:44.062
OPTIONS THAT COULD BE

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.097
CONSIDERED AS WELL SO FOR

00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:48.033
EXAMPLE IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.436
CONCERNED THAT- THE

00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:51.437
AUTHORIZATION WHICH IS

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:53.172
AUTHORIZED UNDER THE PANDEMIC

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.907
EMERGENCY ROLE WOULD GO AWAY

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:55.641
TOO SOON AND MORE TIME IS

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:57.209
NEEDED. THE LEGISLATURE

00:17:57.276 --> 00:18:00.212
CERTAINLY COULD ENACT A STATUTE

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.581
TO TEMPORARILY EXTEND. ANOTHER

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:03.916
EXAMPLE IS IF THE LEGISLATURE

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.684
THINGS THAT MORE TIME IS NEEDED

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.319
TO DISCUSS THE INS AND OUTS

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:09.254
DETAILS OF THIS LANGUAGE

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:10.489
LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO DELAY

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:11.857
ACTING ON THIS LANGUAGE UNTIL

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.325
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LATER INTO

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.327
THE SUMMER. AND SO WE WOULD

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:16.295
WHAT WHICH COMPUTER COMMENTS TO

00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:17.696
SAY YOU KNOW WE'LL BE HAPPY TO

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.798
PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE- AS A

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:23.669
LEGISLATURE CONTINUES. TO WORK

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:24.303
ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:25.504
YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:26.405
FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:31.944
COMMENTS. YOUR MIND FINANCE NOT

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.278
JUST IN GENERAL THE GOAL WITH

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:34.913
THE LANGUAGES FROM PROMOTE

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.215
MODERNIZATION WITHIN CORE

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.616
OPERATIONS AND FLEXIBILITY FOR

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:39.384
COURT USERS BY ALLOWING

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:40.652
TRAVELERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:42.020
MAKE USE OF REMOTE TECHNOLOGY

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:44.156
ROLLED OUT DURING THE PANDEMIC.

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:45.324
WE VIEW THIS LANGUAGE IS A

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.226
STARTING POINT YOU WILL NEED TO

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:48.360
WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:49.661
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:53.098
POTENTIALLY. REFINERY WHICH

00:18:53.165 --> 00:19:00.372
THANK YOU. OKAY OF. ALL RIGHT-

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:03.742
QUESTIONS HERE MEMBERS YES

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.944
CENTER COURTESY. THE THINK

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:10.782
MINIATURE OF. I CAN SAY I HAVE

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.784
A QUESTION KIND OF FRAMED AND

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:16.855
IN MY OWN COMMENTARY AND- I

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:19.992
SUPPOSE IN A PERHAPS PRESIDING

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:21.994
JUDGE MIGHT BE THE BEST PERSON

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.697
TO RESPOND TO THEM- OR OR

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:27.766
SOMEONE FROM THAT SIDE. OF BUT

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:28.634
ANYWAY LET ME JUST SAY THIS

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.237
FIRST OF ALL- I WAS. AS THE

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:34.172
SOMEONE WHO- CAME HERE AFTER OF

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:35.407
BEING A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR A

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.975
DOZEN YEARS SANTA CLARA COUNTY

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.877
WHAT I'D ACTUALLY DONE WHAT WE

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:41.580
CALL REFERRAL AT ONE TIME TO.

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:43.549
EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF. THE

00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:45.817
VIDEO ARRAIGNMENTS- AND REALLY

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:48.053
JUST LIMITING FIVE TO THAT

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.557
AREA- MOSTLY BECAUSE THE COST

00:19:51.623 --> 00:19:53.125
ESTIMATES IN TERMS OF MOVING

00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.660
PEOPLE BACK AND FORTH JUST FOR

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:56.862
AGREEMENTS WHICH THOSE OF US

00:19:56.929 --> 00:20:00.299
WHO PRACTICE NO IS BASICALLY-

NOT GUILTY- YOU KNOW OR NO

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.706
CONTEST- ON THE ON THE CRIMINAL

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:10.342
SIDE. WAS ABOUT A FORTY MILLION

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:12.844
DOLLAR PRICE TAG PER YEAR- IN

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:14.313
IN THE IDEA OF COURSE WASN'T

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:15.681
NECESSARY TO TAKE THAT OUT OF

00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:16.682
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT TO

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:19.751
REINVESTED- IF YOU KNOW IN. IN

00:20:19.818 --> 00:20:23.121
AREAS THAT. WERE DEFICIENT-

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:24.923
WHICH COULD BE ANYTHING FROM

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.192
COST OF DOING BUSINESS

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.794
PERSONAL- A COLLECTIVE

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.529
BARGAINING I MEAN WHATEVER OR

AFLOAT IN GENERAL- WE NEVER

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.336
COMPLETED THAT PROCESS BUT I.

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:39.304
REMAIN VERY INTERESTED IN IT OF

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.707
COURSE. AND I'M HERE IN THE

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:42.674
STATE SENATE SO I'M I'M NOT A

ANYMORE ANYWAY BUT I'M I'M

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:48.280
INTRIGUED BY WHAT ALL ME TO

COUNTY IS DONE. BUT I JUST

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.817
WANTED TO AGAIN MAKE A COUPLE

00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:54.353
OF COMMENTS. I DON'T WANT TO

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:56.922
LISTEN TO THE L. A. O. IT

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:59.157
STRIKES ME THAT WHETHER YOU'RE

00:20:59.224 --> 00:20:59.691
ON THE CIVIL SIDE OF THE

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:06.798
CRIMINAL SIDE- THE. THE

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:09.868
COMPLEXITY SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.870
AT IN TERMS OF COMPLEXITY OF

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.872
THE CASE BUT THE COMPLEXITY OF

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.374
THE PROCEEDINGS FOR EXAMPLE YOU

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.742
CAN HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARILY

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:19.044
COMPLEX CRIMINAL CASE WITH THE

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:22.781
ARRAIGNMENT IS IT IS GENERALLY

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:27.252
AGAIN GENERALLY- IN EXTREMELY-

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:31.089
NON COMPLEX A PROCEEDING-

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:33.191
WHETHER THE CASES WHETHER THE

00:21:33.258 --> 00:21:35.427
UNDERLYING CRIMINAL CASES IS. A

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:36.895
COMPLEX OR NOT YOU KNOW WHETHER

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:38.764
IT'S ALL ON THE SIDE- OR

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.098
MISDEMEANOR FELONY OR

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:43.235
MISDEMEANOR SO- ON THE CIVIL

00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:45.604
SIDE SIMILARLY- AS SOMEBODY WHO

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:48.640
PRACTICED ON ON THAT SIDE FOR.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:50.709
SEVERAL YEARS- AND I'LL JUST

00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:52.310
I'VE NEVER SAID THIS IN PUBLIC

00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:53.979
BUT I BOTH I ALWAYS CONSIDERED

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:55.981
THE CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:59.518
PROCESS TO BE A SORT OF AN

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:03.989
OBNOXIOUS- OFTENTIMES- PROCESS

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:06.525
THAT FELT LIKE. A WASTE OF TOO

00:22:06.591 --> 00:22:08.527
MANY PEOPLE'S TIME TO GO DOWN

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:09.795
TO THE COURTHOUSE SUPPOSING ON

00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:11.263
CIVIL MATTERS TO GO DOWN THE

00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:13.165
COURTHOUSE. YOU KNOW

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.766
ESSENTIALLY SIT DOWN FOR A

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.301
COUPLE TWO OR THREE HOURS

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:18.637
WAITING YOUR TRN TO PRESENT.

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:21.206
OFTENTIMES FOR UNDER A MINUTE-

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:22.541
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE JUDGES

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:23.875
TO HAVE THAT PROCESS SO PLEASE

00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:26.378
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY-

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:27.279
THOSE THOSE ON THE JUDICIAL

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:29.848
SIDE. BUT NOT SO IMPORTANT FOR

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:31.049
SOMEBODY BE SITTING IN THE BACK

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:32.184

THEIR CLIENT WAITING OR AN

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:34.886
OPPORTUNITY TO STAND UP AND

00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:37.255
SAY- WERE TRYING TO REACH A

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.190
SETTLEMENT WE NEED ANOTHER TWO

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:39.858
WEEKS. I MEAN THAT CAN EASILY

00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:43.762
BE DONE. REMOTELY HERE AND MUCH

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:45.430
LIKE THE FOLKS THAT COME IN AND

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:48.066

THEY ARE ON THE DOCKET- WHICH I

00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:55.574
THINK YOU KNOW. WHAT WOULD SAVE

GOVERNMENT GOOD PUBLIC POLICY.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.878
SO I SAID I WOULD ASK A

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:02.114
QUESTION IN THAT CONTEXT AND

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.618
THE QUESTION IS. YOU KNOW USER

00:23:06.685 --> 00:23:09.121
IS THERE MAY BE. SOME SORT OF

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:11.123

DEVELOPED THE CAPACITY LIKE

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:14.993
ALAMEDA AND THEY'RE ALREADY

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.095
SORT OF ROLLING ALONG HAVING A

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:19.231
GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH A MORE

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:21.500
EXPENSIVE VERSION OF REMOTE

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:23.602
COURT PROCEEDINGS- PERHAPS ARE

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:25.570
ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD THROUGH

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:26.872
ONE OF THESE MECHANISMS EVEN IF

00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:29.875
THE SYSTEM EXTENSION OF- THAT

00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:33.178
OF THE CURRENT. AUTHORITY BUT

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.814
IT FOR COUNTIES THAT HAVEN'T

00:23:35.881 --> 00:23:37.649
YOU KNOW GOTTEN OUT FOR HE HAD.

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:41.486
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING THAT-

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:43.021
SIMILAR TO THE L. A. O. SAID

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:45.423
BUT A LITTLE DIFFERENT- GETTING

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.728
INTO NON. I DO NON COMPLEX

00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:53.064
PROCEEDINGS- WETHERBY ONE

00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:54.332
MOTION OR CASE MANAGEMENT

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:56.001
CONFERENCES THOSE KIND OF IN

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:58.737
AND OUT PROCEEDINGS. THAT ARE

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.539
CURRENTLY TAKING UP A LOT OF

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:01.873
CAPACITY IN TIME FROM AN AWFUL

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.942
LOT OF PEOPLE OF SO THAT'S SORT

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:06.144
OF MY PREFERENCE I AM A LITTLE

00:24:06.211 --> 00:24:08.814
LEERY ABOUT. YOU KNOW IN FIFTY

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.150
EIGHT COUNTIES TO SWOOPING IN

00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:16.822
AND SAYING- EVERYBODY- HERE IT

00:24:16.888 --> 00:24:19.090
IS PERHAPS SENDING THE MESSAGE

00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:21.193
EVEN IF IT'S NOT IN THE STATUTE

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:23.295
ITSELF BUT SENDING THE MESSAGE

00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:26.464
THAT- WE WANT YOU TO GO GO FAST

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:28.600
NO MATTER WHAT YOU FEEL YOUR

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:30.502
CURRENT CAPACITY IS. ALL THE

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:32.604
WAY INTO THE TRIAL STAGE IN ON

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:36.408
THE CIVIL CASES- I WOULD

00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:38.410
RESPECT SOME DEGREE OF JUDICIAL

00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:40.579
CONTROL AND LOCAL CONTROL SO TO

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:44.382
SPEAK- BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:46.017
COMFORTABLE YET JUST SORT OF

00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:48.954
OPENING THAT UP KIND OF OPENING

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.823
THE FLOODGATE- I DO THINK THAT.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.492
ON THE ON THE LESS COMPLEX. I

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:57.195
MEAN ON THE MORE COMPLEX- CDNS

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:59.130
THERE'S CONCERN BUT IF YOU JUST

00:24:59.197 --> 00:25:02.901
LIMIT TO. INFRACTIONS IN EVERY

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:05.937
COUNTY OR A SMALL CLAIMS I

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.272
THINK THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:10.675
THERE'S SUCH A SMALL SUB SET OF

00:25:10.742 --> 00:25:12.911
THE BAR IN THE BENCH THAT ARE

00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:14.980
INVOLVED WITH THOSE CASES. THAT

00:25:15.046 --> 00:25:16.781
THAT THE 90% OF THE ATTORNEYS

00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:19.784
WHO WERE DOING- WHO ARE DOING

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:21.486
CIVIL LITIGATION MISDEMEANORS

00:25:21.553 --> 00:25:23.255
FELONIES AND SO FORTH WILL

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:24.689
NEVER GET EXPOSED BECAUSE THEY

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.458
DON'T SHOW UP IN SMALL CLAIMS

00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:29.928
COURT THEY DON'T SHOW UP- YOU

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:31.796
KNOW IT IN SOME OF THE PREVENT.

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:32.898
FOR INFRACTIONS YOU KNOW IN

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:34.132
MANY COUNTIES OF COURSE THAT'S

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:34.833
THE WHOLE POINT OF AN

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.034
INFRACTION THE SAID YOU KNOW

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:37.969
PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND OTHERS

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:40.138
DON'T REALLY HAVE TO LOOK. HE

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:42.240
KNOWS. NECESSARILY EVEN SEEK

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:43.942
OUT COUNCIL SO I DO THINK IF

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.176
WE'RE GOING TO RUN EITHER

00:25:45.243 --> 00:25:47.379
PILOTS OR SOME LIMITED.

00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:48.780
AUTHORITY HERE IT SHOULD BE IN

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:51.316
THESE AREAS WHERE. A MAJORITY

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:54.653
OF THE LITIGATORS- OR OR OR

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:55.987
PROSECUTORS AND DEFENSE

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.455
ATTORNEYS SORT OF HAVE TO SHOW

00:25:57.522 --> 00:25:58.924
UP ANYWAY TO GET TO GET THE

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.226
EXPOSURE. OF AN TO WORK THINGS

00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:03.228
OUT AND- YOU KNOW SORT OF RUN

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:04.796
THESE PILOTS AND REPORT BACK AS

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:05.897
TO HOW THEY WORK HOPEFULLY

00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:07.432
EVERYBODY COMES BACK AND HAS

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:08.633
THE SAME EXPERIENCE OF. HIS

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.535
ALAMEDA BUT I DON'T KNOW. THAT

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:12.203
WOULD BE THE CASE AND IF ANYONE

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.605
WANTS TO RESPOND TO THAT YOU

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:15.674
KNOW THAT MY QUESTION IS

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.342
ESSENTIALLY IS DOES THAT SOUND.

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:19.544
REASONABLE WHEN YOU START

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:20.045
LOOKING AT THE STATEWIDE

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:23.748
CONTACTS IN. AGAIN I DON'T KNOW

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:25.517
IF THE JUDGE- WOULD BE WILLING

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:28.353
TO RESPOND TO THAT IF NOT

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.723
THAT'S FINE. I WOULD BE HAPPY

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.290
TO RESPOND AND I APPRECIATE

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:34.492
YOUR COMMENTS. AGREE WITH THEM

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.461
COMPLETELY AND I THINK YOUR

00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:38.463
OBSERVATIONS ARE BOTH A STUDENT

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.732
VERY CONSISTENT. WITH WHAT OUR

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.834
CORE USERS HAVE EXPERIENCED

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:43.568
WHILE WE'VE BEEN IN A REMOTE

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.103
OPERATIONS AFTER HAVING BEEN IN

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.505
PERSON. IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:49.607
ARRAIGNMENTS WE ACTUALLY FIRST

00:26:49.674 --> 00:26:51.009
SET UP A REMOTE VIDEO

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:52.978
ARRAIGNMENT COURT. IN THE LATE

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:55.814
NINETIES SERU HARD LINE NOW

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.383
THAT WAS DISCONTINUED OVERTIME

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.286
IN AROUND TWENTY TEN. AND WAS

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:03.822
NOT REACTIVATED UNTIL WE

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:05.490
RECONNECTED THOSE HARD LINES

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:06.524
THIS YEAR WITH THE CORONA VIRUS

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.760
PANDEMIC. AND WE DID EXACTLY

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:10.195
FOR THE REASON THAT YOU STATED.

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.696
IT WAS SIMPLY UNSAFE TO

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:13.565
TRANSPORT INMATES FORTY FIVE

00:27:13.631 --> 00:27:15.066
MINUTES TO AN HOUR AND A HALF

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.868
ACROSS COUNTY. FOR A THIRTY

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:18.069
SECOND ARRAIGNMENT WHEN THEY

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:19.704
COULD APPEAR FROM THE JAIL

00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:21.439
REMOTELY AND IN FACT HAVE

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:23.274
GREATER ACCESS TO OUR RESOURCES

00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:25.377
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT ACCESS THEN

00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:27.245
AND THERE. SIMILARLY ON THE

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:28.847
CIVIL SCENARIOS IT AVOIDS

00:27:28.913 --> 00:27:30.749
EXACTLY WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT.

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:32.751
THE LONG DELAYED WAIT FOR A

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:37.822
VERY SHORT COURT APPEARANCE. IN

00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:40.058
TERMS OF. HOW THIS WOULD MANAGE

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.726
ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL THERE'S A

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:43.261
HUGE DISTINCTION IN THE

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:45.096
LANGUAGE OF THE TRAILER BILL

00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:46.831
THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE NOT

00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:47.999
ALL COURTS ARE SIMILARLY

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:49.734
SITUATED AND OF COURSE IN ORDER

00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:51.002
TO MAKE REMOTE TECHNOLOGY WORK

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:52.270
YOU NEED TO HAVE THE BEST

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:54.339
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE. WE IN

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:55.840
ALAMEDA COUNTY WERE FORTUNATE

00:27:55.907 --> 00:27:57.475
IN THAT WERE A RELATIVELY URBAN

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:58.676
ENVIRONMENT DEPENDING ON WHERE

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.311
YOU ARE IN THE COUNTY AND WE

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:02.480
HAVE FAIRLY CONSISTENT WIFI AND

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:05.050
INTERNET ACCESS. FOR ALMOST

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:06.985
EVERYBODY WHO USES OUR COURTS

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:10.221
AND WE PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES FOR

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:11.423
THOSE THAT NEED ALTERNATIVES.

00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:13.758
RURAL AREAS MAYBE DIFFERENTLY

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:15.460
SITUATED. AND WHAT HAPPENED

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:16.761
WITH THE EMERGENCY RULES AS

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:18.463
EMERGENCY ROLE THREE

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.066
AUTHORIZED. EACH LOCAL SUPERIOR

00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:23.101
COURT TO CREATE ITS OWN LOCAL

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:24.436
EMERGENCY RULES BASED ON THE

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:26.237
NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. IN

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:28.006
ALAMEDA COUNTY WE MAY PROMOTE

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:30.575
APPEARANCES AS I SAID MANDATORY

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:32.410
IN THOSE NON CRIMINAL CASE

00:28:32.477 --> 00:28:34.045
TYPES BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:35.313
WAY WE COULD OPEN IT WAS THE

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.548
ONLY WAY WE CAN SERVE THE

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:37.882
PUBLIC AND WE BELIEVED WE HAD A

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:39.884
PLATFORM AND THE ALTERNATIVES.

00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:41.753
AVAILABLE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.788
NOT EVERYBODY IS SIMILARLY

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.356
SITUATED OR IS ABLE TO DO THAT.

00:28:45.423 --> 00:28:47.092
THAT'S WHY THE TRAILER LANGUAGE

00:28:47.158 --> 00:28:50.095
THAT WE HAVE HERE IS PERMISSIVE.

00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:51.496
SO IT WOULD GIVE THE COURTS

00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:54.099
THAT FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:55.400
ONLY THOSE THAT WERE READY TO

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:58.470
PROCEED. CAN CHRISSY. NOW I'M

00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:00.438
NOT SURE THAT THAT ANSWERED ALL

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:01.072
OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT I'M HAPPY

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:03.908
TO ANSWER. OR FOLLOW UP IN AN

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:05.443
AREA THAT I MIGHT HAVE MISSED-

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.945
I JUST APPRECIATE THE I WAS

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:07.946
JUST LOOKING FOR EITHER

00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:10.582
AFFIRMATION OR- REJECTION OF

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:12.784
SOME OF THOSE THOUGHTS AND IT

00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:14.185
SOUNDS LIKE GENERALLY SPEAKING-

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:16.521
IT LEAST- FROM THE JUDGE'S

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:19.290
PERSPECTIVE- MY THOUGHTS ARE ON

00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:20.658
TRACK BUT THAT'S- THAT'S ALL

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:21.960
EFFORT. I DON'T WANT TO. OVER

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:24.829
EXTEND THE HEARING- IN IN MADAM

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:27.132
CHAIR I CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:29.501
DEFERRED TO YOUR LEADERSHIP

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:33.304
AND- WHATEVER THOUGHTS RISK

00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:33.938
COMMITTEE HAS. THANK YOU THANK

YOU MEASURE SO IT APPRECIATE

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:41.012
THE DISCUSSION SO FAR MY

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:41.846
QUESTION KIND OF BILLS ON THAT

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:44.616
IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND A JURY

00:29:44.682 --> 00:29:46.417
TRIALS DONE REMOTELY YEAH AND

CORRECTED THIS IS PART OF THE

00:29:49.687 --> 00:29:53.691
PILOT MIGHT ACTUALLY- INCLUDE

00:29:53.758 --> 00:29:54.592
DURING DOING AT LEAST CIVIL.

00:29:54.659 --> 00:29:57.662
JURY TRIALS ARE MELISSA CORRECT.

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:00.064
WELL I THINK. I SHOULD HAVE

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:01.099
SOMEBODY I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:04.068

COURTS TO AUTHORIZE REMOTE

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:12.277
APPEARANCES IN DIFFERENT CASE

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:13.011
TYPES AND IN DIFFERENT

00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:14.579
PROCEEDINGS BASED ON THE NEEDS

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:16.381
OF EACH COURT. TO THAT THAT

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:17.782
WOULD AT LEAST THEORETICALLY

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.217
AND INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:20.718
FUTURE PARTICIPATION MOMENT

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:22.187
CIGARETTE CORRECT AND IN

ALAMEDA COUNTY WE HAVE BEEN

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.723
OPERATING OUR CIVIL JURY TRIALS

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.158
REMOTELY FROM START TO FINISH.

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:28.593
INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.195
JURORS TO COME IN FOR THAT

00:30:30.261 --> 00:30:31.563
FIRST APPEARANCE INSTEAD OF

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:33.131
PHYSICALLY AT THE COURTHOUSE.

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:34.232
THEY CAN APPEAR FROM THEIR HOME

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:36.067
LOCATION THEIR OFFICE WHEREVER

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:37.635
IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR THEM. SO

00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:39.237
IT MADE IT REALLY IS

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:40.138
INTERESTING SO WE'VE ALL HAD

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:42.006
KIND OF ASSUME. THE CRASH

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:44.576
COURSE IN LIVING BECAUSE HIM.

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:45.643
AND SOMETHING'S TO CENTER

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.512
CORTESE'S POINT WORK EMILY

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.647
WELL. USING NO TECHNOLOGY IN

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:51.316
OTHER THINGS- YOU MIGHT ARGUE

00:30:51.382 --> 00:30:52.884
ARE ARE INTRINSICALLY DIFFERENT

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:53.985
AND WHEN ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:55.420
MIGHT BE JURY TRIALS RIGHT

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:56.421
WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF.

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:58.423
NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION WHERE

00:30:58.489 --> 00:30:59.958
PHYSICAL PROXIMITY IS PROBABLY.

00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:01.960
AT LEAST TRADITIONALLY BEEN

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:04.729
PART OF THE EXPERIENCE IN THE

00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:05.530
BASIS THAT I THINK FOR BOTH

00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:08.866
SIDES. WHAT'S THE STANDARD.

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:10.835
MOVING FORWARD WHETHER YOU KNOW

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:12.370
WE CAN ARRIVE AT CONSENSUS

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:13.705
WHETHER IT KIND OF WORKS OR

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:18.977
DOESN'T WORK. THE. ACROSS

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:21.412
DIFFERENT KOREJE. AND ANYBODY

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:24.482
ELSE ANY SO THIS IS. AGAIN THIS

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:25.383
IS ROBERT A YOUNG FROM THE

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.052
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. I'D ALSO LIKE

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:30.888
TO. RESPOND SENATOR CORTE-

00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:33.391
QUESTION- AND I'M ACTUALLY GLAD

00:31:33.458 --> 00:31:34.859
THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THE-

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:37.161
EXAMPLE OF THE- SANTA CLARA

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:39.731
ARRANGEMENTS BECAUSE WHEN THAT

00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:41.266
ACTIVITY WAS HAPPENING I WAS

00:31:41.332 --> 00:31:43.334
ACTUALLY THE CHIEF INFORMATION

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.302
OFFICER AT THE SANTA CLARA

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:46.204
COURT BY LOOKING AT HELPING TO

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:48.973
IMPLEMENT. VIDEO ARRAIGNMENTS-

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.708
AT SANTA CLARA AND I WAS ALSO

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:52.277
VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT WAS

00:31:52.343 --> 00:31:54.612
I'M NOT ABLE TO BE IMPLEMENTED

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:56.014
BECAUSE WE SAW THAT THERE WOULD

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.815
BE A HUGE BENEFIT AND IN DOING

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.851
THAT. I'M IN TERMS OF THE

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:01.786
READINESS OF THE COURTS AND-

00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:03.588
THE L. A. O.'S- SUGGESTION

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:04.956
AROUND A PILOT AND THIS

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:06.824
DISCUSSION AS WELL. AROUND THE

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:09.560
A PILOT- IN FACT WE ALREADY

00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:11.763
HAVE FIFTY FOUR COURTS TO HAVE

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:14.932
REMOTE PRECEDING CAPABILITY IN

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:17.001
AT LEAST ONE CASE TYPE ARE WE

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:18.603
HAVE ACTUALLY THIRTY EIGHT

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.304
COURTS MORE THAN HALF OF THE

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.539
COURT- HAVE REMOTE CAPABILITIES

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:24.809
IN ALL CASE TYPES AND SO. WE

00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:27.345
THE EXAMPLE THAT CHURCH STATES

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:28.813
THAT TELLS- HAS. VERY

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.948
ELOQUENTLY- DESCRIBED IN

00:32:31.015 --> 00:32:34.419
ALAMEDA IS A SITUATION IN MANY

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:36.020
OF OUR COURTS RIGHT NOW- AND SO

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:38.923
WE ARE PROVIDING SERVICE. TO

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.292
THE PUBLIC IN THIS MANNER- AND

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.494
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY

00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:44.696
WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.431
GETTING THEIR FEEDBACK ARE

00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:47.665
REGARDING WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:49.567
NOT WORKING IN ORDER FOR US TO

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:51.002
ENHANCE OUR PROCESSES TO

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:53.271
IMPROVE THAT OVERALL SERVICE. I

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:54.572
AM THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THE L.

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:57.475
A. O. HAS MAKE A REGARDING. THE

00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:59.344
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN QUESTIONS

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.046
THAT SHE HOMBRES THOSE ARE

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:03.281
ACTUALLY ALL QUESTIONS THAT

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:05.416
WOULD BE ANSWERED THROUGH OUR

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:07.785
STANDARD RULES MAKING PROCESS

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:09.487
SO THROUGH THE RULES OF COURT-

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:11.456
ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT THE L.

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:13.758
A. L. HAS RAISED- WE WOULD GO

00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.960
THROUGH THAT PROCESS- WHICH

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:18.896
WOULD INCLUDE OUR- COMMITTEES.

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:20.998
AS WELL AS EXTENSIVE PUBLIC

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:23.801
COMMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE-

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:29.240
PROVIDING BALANCED. RULES THAT

00:33:29.307 --> 00:33:30.041
ADDRESS ALL THE NEEDS OF THE

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:32.677
POOR. BUT IN- YOU KNOW FORM-

00:33:32.744 --> 00:33:33.978
BOTTOM FIRST. MAKING THAT WE'RE

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:36.848
PROVIDING TO JUSTICE IN A VERY

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:40.618
SAFE AND EFFICIENT MANNER.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:42.220
ANYMORE QUESTIONS CENTER NEW NO

00:33:42.286 --> 00:33:47.024
OKAY- THEY HAVE THE HANDLE OKAY

00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:51.863
BELIAU PLEASE CONSUME. I'M

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:54.031
ANNUALLY WITH THE L. A. S. SO-

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:56.501
A COUPLE OF PIECES OF TIME BACK

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.936
TO SENATOR NEWMAN QUESTIONS SO

00:33:59.003 --> 00:34:01.139
THE FIRST ISSUE IS FROM THE

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:04.008
COURTS IN VERY QUICKLY DURING

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:05.576
THE PANDEMIC AND I AND I AND I

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:07.779
WON IT WAS LIKE THEY DID LOTS

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:09.046
OF THINGS WERE EMPLOYED. AND I

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:10.615
THINK THE CHALLENGE ON THAT ONE

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.083
IS DIFFERENT COURTS ARE DOING

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.786
THINGS IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:16.487
THERE IS NOT A GREAT ASSESSMENT

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.456
OF WHAT THOSE SIMILARITIES AND

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.458
DIFFERENCES R. AS WELL AS SORT

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:23.027
OF A- OF HOW THINGS ARE GOING I

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:24.996
THINK THAT'S KIND OF ONE. PIECE

00:34:25.062 --> 00:34:26.597
THAT I WOULD LAY OUT FOR THE

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:28.933
LEGISLATURE AND SO PART OF THE

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.835
CONCEPT IN TERMS OF THE PLAN OR

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.069
OR EVEN A PILOT SO UNDER

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:33.371
RECOGNITION OF PILOT IT IS

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:34.505
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT COULD

00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:37.275
BE TESTED AND EVALUATED ON A

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:40.111
MORE ROBUST BASIS TO THEN

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:42.013
INFORM DECISIONS MOVING

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:45.082
FORWARD. THE SECOND ISSUE IS-

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:46.451
YOU KNOW MISTER- AND MENTIONED

00:34:46.517 --> 00:34:47.985
THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:49.887
PLANNING ON DEVELOPING RULES OF

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:51.355
CORE IN FLUSHING OUT SOME OF

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:52.156
THOSE KEY IMPLEMENTATION

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:53.257
QUESTIONS I THINK IT'S

00:34:53.324 --> 00:34:54.125
CERTAINLY TRUE THAT THE

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:55.026
JUDICIAL BRANCH WILL HAVE

00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.561
QUESTIONS AS SORRY IT WILL HAVE

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:57.829
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT AND

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:59.397
VERY THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS

00:34:59.464 --> 00:35:01.232
OUR CONCERN IS BASICALLY THAT

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:03.868
THE LEGISLATURE AND THEIR ROLE.

00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:06.070
WOULD LIKELY WANT TO HAVE IN

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:07.538
PLACE ON SOME OF THOSE KEY

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:10.041
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND SO

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:11.642
IT IS A POLICY DECISION FOR

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:13.211
EXAMPLE ON WHETHER OR NOT THERE

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:14.345
SHOULD BE CERTAIN MINIMUM

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:16.280
STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:35:16.347 --> 00:35:17.615
DIFFERENCES FROM COUNTY TO

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:20.618
COUNTY ARE NOT TOO EXTREME- AND

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:22.320
SO THAT COULD FOR EXAMPLE

00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:23.754
INCLUDE JUST MINIMUM STANDARDS

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:25.456
RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY MINIMUM

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:27.091
STANDARDS RELATED TO RULES N

00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:29.126
TERMS OF WHAT PROCEEDINGS THAT

00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.127
IS APPROPRIATE AND ARE NOT

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:32.463
APPROPRIATE. FOR EXAMPLE SO I

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:33.564
THINK THAT THOSE ARE JUST A

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:40.905
COUPLE OF COMMENTS WE WANTED.

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:42.673
TO ADD SO THANK YOU. BUT SO

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.576
THANK MY WRITER. THANK YOU- I

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:47.745
AM- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.013
BEFORE MY COM. A THE EMERGING

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.814
ROOM. AND THE TIME MEAN AROUND

00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:52.316
THE RAY OF THE EMERGENCY RULE

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:56.187
MAYBE. OF WHOEVER THE L. A. O.

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:58.789
OR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH- COULD

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:01.058
EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE DO

00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:04.161
HAVE A RULE IN PLACE. AS AN

00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:05.763
EMERGENCY RULE FOR A CERTAIN

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.099
LENGTH OF TIME- THAT HAS

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:09.567
ALLOWED ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY

00:36:09.634 --> 00:36:12.169
BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF THE

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:14.305
PANDEMIC ON OUR COMMUNITIES- SO

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:16.474
IF SOMEONE COULD ANSWER THAT

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:19.343
QUESTION. YES SO THIS IS-

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.978
ROBERT A YOUNG FROM JUDICIAL

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:23.114
COUNCIL SO THE EMERGENCY RULE

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.750
RIGHT NOW- IS REMAINING WILL

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:28.185
REMAIN IN EFFECT. UNTIL NINETY

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:29.387
DAYS AFTER THE GOVERNOR

00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:31.522
DECLARES. THAT THE STATE OF

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:32.857
EMERGENCY RELATED TO THE

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:35.393
PANDEMIC IS LIFTED. OR AND

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:38.129
CHILLED THE RULES IS AMENDED OR

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:38.930
REPEALED BY THE JUDICIAL

00:36:38.996 --> 00:36:41.332
COUNCIL- AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:44.535
THAT. ARE THE PROBLEM A STATE

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:45.303
OF EMERGENCY SHOULD NOT BE

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:46.804
CONFUSED WITH THE ELIMINATION

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:49.373
OF THE TIER SYSTEM THAT'S

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.242
COMING UP ON JUNE FIFTEENTH.

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.677
OKAY SO THERE IS NO CURRENT

00:36:52.743 --> 00:36:53.911
DATE FOR THE OBVIOUSLY FOR THE

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:56.414
MERGES C. TO BE LIFTED. AND IT

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.214
WOULD BE NINETY DAYS AFTER

00:36:57.281 --> 00:37:02.420
THAT. CORRECT SO. IT WOULD BE

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:04.155
UNFAIR TO SAY THAT WE HAVE AT

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:07.291
LEAST. SIX MONTHS NINE MONTHS

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:13.464
TWELVE MONTHS. IS THAT A. IS IT

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:16.667
UNFAIR TO COME UP WITH A ROUGH

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:20.404
DATE AS TO WHEN THIS COULD BE A

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.940
MERGING ZERO COULD BE LIFTED. I

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:24.875
WOULD BE VERY VERY HESITANT TO

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:27.178
GUESS AS TO WHEN THE GOVERNOR

00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:28.245
WOULD DECLARE THAT THE STATE OF

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:30.381
EMERGENCY WOULD BE LIFTED YEAH

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:33.684
YEP YOU'RE RIGHT- WELL I AND I

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:37.121
THINK THAT THERE ARE. OBVIOUSLY

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:39.857
WE WERE ALL. SORT OF WRITING

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:41.759
THE NEW RULES AS WE WENT ALONG.

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:43.995
LIKE NOBODY SAID OKAY FOR THE

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:45.363
NEXT SIX MONTHS I KNOW THIS IS

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.697
GOING TO HAPPEN I KNOW WHAT THE

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.232
IMPACT IT'S GOING TO BE SO

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:50.301
LET'S DO IT THIS WAY. AND I BET

00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:52.770
IT WAS AT TIMES ON A DAILY

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:54.438
BASIS AT TIMES ON A WEEKLY

00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:56.607
BASIS. BUT THERE WAS THIS

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:58.109
CONSTANT HOW DO WE DO THIS

00:37:58.175 --> 00:37:59.443
WE'RE DOING THIS GOOD THIS IS

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.046
NOT WORKING- AND THAT'S WHAT

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:06.083
SORT OF- MAKES ME HESITATE.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.352
THAT THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:10.187
DONE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:12.289
VERSUS THINKING ABOUT HIM ON A

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:14.659
PERMANENT BASIS. AND THE

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:16.927
DELIBERATE INVOLVEMENT AND

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:19.330
INTEGRATION OF A LOT OF

00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:22.333
STAKEHOLDERS- THE EMPLOYEES WHO

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.669
WORK IN THOSE COURTS. THE

00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:26.537
PEOPLE WHO USE THE COURT

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:29.540
SERVICES- WHAT IS A WE'RE STILL

00:38:29.607 --> 00:38:31.075
DEALING WITH THIS WHEN IT COMES

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.843
TO EVERYTHING ELSE IN OUR LIVES

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.413
IS ACCESS TO CONNECTIVITY.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:38.215
ACCESS TO THE DEVICES- AND I

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:39.717
THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:41.152
THINGS THAT CERTAINLY COME UP

00:38:41.218 --> 00:38:44.221
BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:46.223
BUT EVEN WITHIN URBAN AREAS-

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.558
IT'S NOT LIKE ACCESS AND

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:50.895
CONNECTIVITY IS SO PERFECT NOW.

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:53.497
SO I HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS

00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:55.399
ABOUT USING THE EXPERIENCE.

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:57.535
THAT WE WENT THROUGH AS THE

00:38:57.601 --> 00:39:00.504
EXCLUSIVE WAY TO DECIDE WHAT WE

00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:02.073
SHOULD DO MOVING FORWARD

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:04.542
PERMANENTLY AND ALSO

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:07.778
ENCOMPASSING. THE WAY THAT IS

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:12.416
BEING- PROPOSED HERE- YOU KNOW

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:13.951
THERE'S ISSUES OF PUBLIC SAFETY

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:17.288
THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUALS-

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:19.023
YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY'S BEEN

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.791
DECIDE OKAY TOLD YOU COULD DO

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.993
IT FROM HOME. WHAT KIND OF

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.395
PRIVACY DO YOU HAVE IF YOU'RE

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:27.965
DOING IT FROM HOME- SO- AND

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:28.766
THAT COULD LEAD TO THE SAFETY

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:32.036
ISSUES- SO I HAVE A SOME REAL

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:36.874
CONCERNS I DO THINK THAT. IT WE

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:38.676
WERE TALKING ABOUT A COMPLETELY

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:41.679
REVAMPING. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:43.481
NOT THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:46.150
JUDICIAL SYSTEM BUT HOW PEOPLE

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:48.152
RELATE TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:50.387
THE THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE ON

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:52.089
HAVING ACCESS TO THE JUDICIAL

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:53.858
SYSTEM I THINK ALL OF THAT

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:54.825
WE'RE BEING ASKED AS THE

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:57.895
LEGISLATURE. TO COMPLETELY

00:39:57.962 --> 00:40:00.664
REVAMP EVERYTHING. AND WITHOUT

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.833
HAVING HAD I THINK THE THOROUGH

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.302
CONVERSATION OF WHAT THAT MEANS

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:08.472
WELL WITH THE KIND OF A PLAN

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:09.073
THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO DO

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.109
THAT- THERE'S IT'S LIKE. YOU

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:14.011
KNOW REMOTE LEARNING WHAT WE

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:15.813
FIND OUT ABOUT THAT- WHAT

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.915
WORKED AND WHAT DIDN'T HOW LONG

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:18.916
WOULD IT TAKE I MEAN WE'RE

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.751
STILL WORKING THAT IT BESIDES

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:23.854
MAKING A PERMANENT DECISION SO.

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:27.925
IDEA I WOULD- I PERSONALLY.

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:31.395
THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION A PLAN

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:33.030
SO THAT WE COULD DISCUSS OF THE

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:36.433
LEGISLATURE. IS IS THE BEST WAY

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.936
TO GO INCORPORATING THE

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:41.539
EXPERIENCES UP UNTIL NOW- I

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:43.574
THINK THERE'S JUST FAR TOO MANY

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:45.810
ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:50.481
EXPLAINED AND PUT FORWARD- AND

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:52.449
I'M YOU KNOW COUNTY NON.

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:54.618
EMPLOYEES WHO MAKE THIS WORK I

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:56.587
GOT A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT ALL

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:59.757
THE ISSUES THAT COME UP FROM.

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:02.593
MORE REPORTERS- AND- THEIR

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.362
INABILITY TO DISTINGUISH WHEN

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.231
THERE'S A CAMERA MICROPHONE

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:09.066
DEPENDING ON WHERE IT'S PLACED

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.634
WE'VE HEARD FROM INTERPRETERS

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.903
WILL FIND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.272
TO HEAR- SOMETIMES LAWYERS

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:16.941
TALKING OVER THEMSELVES I MEAN

00:41:17.007 --> 00:41:18.042
THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF THINGS

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:20.077
THAT HAPPEN IN THE REAL WORLD

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.346
DAY TO DAY. THAT I THINK NEED

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:25.382
TO BE REALLY- ARE MUCH MORE

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.218
THOUGHTFUL BUT WE DECIDE ON

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:29.253
HAVING A PERMANENT AND THAT'S

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.256
WHAT THIS IS A PERMANENT AS-

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:34.692
THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED- CENTER

00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:36.994
GROVE ANY. AUSTIN'S ARE

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:39.263
COMMENTS MADAM CHAIR I

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.097
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:42.066
APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE I'M

00:41:42.132 --> 00:41:42.666
KIND OF BOUNCING AROUND TODAY

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:45.669
AND COMMITTEES OF I THINK THAT

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:47.371
WE LEARNED A LOT FROM COLLUDED-

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:48.405
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:49.640
LEARNED THAT WERE VERY POSITIVE

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:50.507
AND SOME TINGS THAT WERE VERY

00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:52.042
NEGATIVE THE IMPACT ON OUR

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:53.978
CHILDREN FOR INSTANCE WAS

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:58.215
NEGATIVE- BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:00.651
YOU TAKE. M. VINO VIRTUAL VISIT

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:04.188
VIRTUAL VISITS FROM DOCTORS- TO

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:06.190
BE ABLE TO ASSESS SOME SOME

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:07.424
SITUATIONS WITH THEIR PATIENTS

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:09.326
IT. SEES THE PATIENTS FROM

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:10.928
TRAVELLING AND BACK AND FORTH

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:12.263
AND I THINK THAT APPLIES HERE

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:14.498
TO THE COURT SYSTEM. NGUYEN WE

00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:16.000
CAN USE A VIRTUAL APPEARANCES

00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:17.401
AND DO SOME VIRTUAL CHANGES AND

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:18.535
LEARN WHAT WORKED WELL IN THE

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:20.337
COURT SYSTEM FOR COATED. AND

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:21.872
APPLY THOSE PROCESSES MOVING

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:23.240
FORWARD I THINK IT'S A COST

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:25.209
SAVING MEASURE. IT'S A SECURITY

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:26.677
MEASURE THAT HELPS YOU'RE NOT

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:28.345
TRANSPORTING AN INDIVIDUAL

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:30.281
INMATES FROM. THE SYSTEM INTO

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:32.216
THE COURTHOUSE- THERE'S A LOT

00:42:32.283 --> 00:42:33.450
OF THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:35.552
CO BUT THAT WOULD BE GOOD- IF

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:36.587
IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE WE WERE

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:38.055
FORCED TO IMPLEMENT THEM UNDER

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.590
THE COVER NINETEEN RESPONSE

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:42.493
THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD- SO I DO

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:43.794
THINK THAT IS SOMETHING WE

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:44.595
SHOULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT WE

00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:46.297
SHOULD DEFINITELY- IMPLEMENT

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:47.698
WHAT WAS GOOD. THATWE LEARN

00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:49.433
FROM THIS COVERED SITUATION AND

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.969
THEN NOT IMPLEMENT WORKED IS-

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:54.672
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:55.372
TRADITIONALLY SOMETHING BAD.

00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:57.274
THANK YOU FOR A MAKE A COMMENT.

00:42:57.341 --> 00:43:01.445
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- SOMEONE

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:04.682
ELSE WANTS TO SPEAK OKAY. YOUR

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.817
OF IS THAT YOU DON'T START I

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:08.886
WAS LOOKING UP AT THE LIBERTY

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:10.154
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.356
YOU'RE NOT USED TO FIFTH POINT

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:14.925
FOR THIS GOOD POINT OKAY YES

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:18.062
CENTER FOR DISEASE- THANK YOU

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:20.097
FOR ALL YOU. COM I THINK IT

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:21.899
THERE IS- SPOKE HUMAN CENTER

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:22.967
NEWMAN INDICATED WE'VE HAD OUR

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:24.568
OWN LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENCE

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:27.004
WITH. A LOT OF THINGS GOING

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:28.772
RIGHT AND THEN SOME THINGS. AND

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:30.040
I THINK INTERPRETERS HAVE BEEN

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:30.941
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES IT'S HARD

00:43:31.008 --> 00:43:33.043
FOR. HER TO STEP IN AND SORT

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.578
THAT OUT SOMETIMES WHEN IT'S

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:35.212
REMOTES WILL BE INTERESTING TO

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:37.181
HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT ON SINCE

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:39.149
WORD THE BUDGET. COMMITTEE

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:41.185
BASICALLY- ONE OF THE THINGS

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:43.120
THAT WOULD BE. OF INTEREST TO

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:44.555
ME GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF A

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:46.156
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS WITH

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:47.992
THESE THIRTY EIGHT COURTS THAT

00:43:48.058 --> 00:43:50.194
HAVE GONE. ALL THE WAY SO TO

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.931
SPEAK IN IN IN EVEN THE FIFTY

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:56.333
FOUR. WHO ARE. NOT NECESSARILY-

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.969
ALL THE WAY- IF THAT WAS THE

00:43:59.036 --> 00:43:59.636
RIGHT NUMBER BUT THE- THE

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:03.173
QUESTION IS. HOW THE- HOW WOULD

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.743
OF THE DONE WITH THE SAVINGS-

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:08.879
IN IT IN AB I FULLY UNDERSTAND

00:44:08.946 --> 00:44:10.314
THAT THE COURT SYSTEM HAS HAD.

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:12.750
IT'S CHALLENGES ALMOST ACROSS

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:16.186
THE BOARD IN TERMS OF- BUDGET

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:18.856
THEIR OWN BUDGET IMPACT RATE-

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:21.325
IS THERE NEED FOR RESOURCES SO

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:23.761
I DON'T SUGGESTS. THAT THERE

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.996
THERE IS A PLENTY OF NEED I

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:26.864
JUST DON'T KNOW GIVEN ALL THE

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.233
NEEDS. YOU KNOW HOW SOME OF

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:31.702
THOSE COUNTIES- COURT SYSTEMS

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:33.404
MADE THE DECISION OR WHETHER

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.372
THAT WAS MADE YOU KNOW FOR ME

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:37.307
SOMEHOW AT THE STATE LEVEL. I

00:44:37.374 --> 00:44:39.143
DON'T NEED AN ANSWER NOW. I

00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:41.512
JUST THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:43.714
FOR US AND YOU TALKED ABOUT-

WELL JUST BY USING THESE

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:22.218
DIAGNOSTIC. TOOL SO WHAT MAKES

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:24.454
THE CLIMATE OF COURSE WORK. IS

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:26.356
THE DAY YOU OF THAT THAT

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:28.425
POSITION OF THE COURTESAN AT

SUPERVISION POSITION WHETHER

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:31.161
IT'S PROBATION COMMUNITY

00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:33.296
SUPERVISION OR PAROLE. THEY USE

THAT POSITION TO THEM BRING

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:36.933
BILLS EFFECTIVE TOOLS IN AND

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.601
ACTUALLY DO WHAT EVIDENCE BASED

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.737
ON THE DATA TELLS US- BUT WE

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.839

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:45.909
OTHER TWO THINGS THAT I THINK.

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:48.111
REALLY MAKE THE MODEL WORK- IS

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:49.813
THE FACT THAT IT IS THE USE OF

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.614
DATA EVERYTHING WE DO IS DRIVEN

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:53.349

COMMUNITY RESOURCES AVAILABLE

00:56:13.002 --> 00:56:14.971

IT WILL REALLY LOST A LOT OF

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:14.751
BELIEVE WITH THAT MONEY- WEIT

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:16.185
WAS REPLACED WITH FIRST

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.887
INNOVATIONS AND THEN RECIDIVISM

00:59:17.954 --> 00:59:19.522
REDUCTION INNOVATION WAS ABOUT

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:21.891
I WAS ABOUT TEN TEN MILLION FOR

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:22.859
COLLABORATIVE COURTS OVER

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:24.327
COUPLE YEARS RECIDIVISM

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:25.929
REDUCTION NINE POINT NINE

00:59:25.995 --> 00:59:27.463
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON THOSE

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.965
GOT REPLACED BUT THOSE ARE

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.934
THOSE WERE TEMPORARY PILOT

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.269
FUNDING. AND THE PROBLEM THAT

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:34.137
YOU HAVE WHEN YOU WANT TO TRY

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.406
TO GET A COURT- TO GO TO SCALE

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:38.007
AND REALLY USE THESE PRINCIPLES

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.977
IS IT'S HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:42.412
BUY INTO THAT WE AND OUR

00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:44.080
FUNDING SOURCES GOING TO GO

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:46.582
AWAY SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WE HOW

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:48.251
WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF COURTS

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.852
AND I ACTUALLY WAS REALLY TO

00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:51.321
BENEFIT SURE OF IT BECAUSE WE

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:52.889
USED A LOT OF MONEY TO THE

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:54.490
OTHER COURTS AT OTHER COURTS

00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:56.159
WERE USING IN THE PROGRAM

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:57.827
BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THAT

00:59:57.894 --> 01:00:00.763
STABILITY THAT LONG TERM-

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.932
SHORT. SO THE ABILITY TO HAVE

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.901
THAT STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:07.036
WOULD LET COURTS TAKE THIS

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.772
CONCEPT IN USE THIS SUPREME

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.708
COURT CONCEPT TO DEAL WITH THE

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:14.444
WORKLOAD MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.013
IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS- STAFF

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.748
IS DONE A LOT OF TIME AND ALSO

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:21.050
OF OTHER COURTS- IN TERMS OF

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:22.618
WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE WHAT

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:23.886
WHAT THEY'D DONE IN OTHER

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.688
STATES IN A LOT OF OTHER STATES

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:27.790
HAVE FUNDED ON THE RANGE WE GET

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:34.263
MY GLASSES. ARE HERE FOR A

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.965
SECOND SO I CAN GET THERE- YOU

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:39.302
KNOW. HOW OTHER STATES. IT WILL.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.403
THE RECOUNT POPULAR. THE

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.338
ESTARá WOULD BE TO SIX MILLION

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.306
TO SIXTY FOUR MILLIONS I AM

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:45.041
THINK JUSTIN INVESTMENT OF WERE

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:48.011
THIRTY MILLION- PER YEAR WHAT

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:49.812
I'M PROBABLY REALLY EFFECTIVE

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:51.814
STATEWIDE IN TERMS OF GETTING

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.483
COURTS TO STEP FORWARD AND

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.485
REALLY USING THIS POWER THAT

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:56.719
QUITE FRANKLY WE'RE NOT USING

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.521
RIGHT RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THE

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.056
TRADITIONAL IS YOU KNOW JUST

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:01.891
JAIL IS THE ANSWER TO THAT

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.026
RESOURCE IS THE TRADITIONAL

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.961
RESPONSE INSTEAD OF DOING THIS

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:06.863
INTEGRATED BEHAVIOR BASED THING

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.231
WHICH I THINK THE COURTS COULD

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:11.300
VERY EFFECTIVELY DO ACT THAT

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.469
THREE MILLION DOLLAR ANNUALLY A

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.571
YEAR AFTER YOU GET A LOT BETTER

TIME YOU GET A REDUCTION IN

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:22.111
CASES COMING THROUGH IT'S

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:22.678
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:23.579
REALLY HELP. SO A QUESTION YOU

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:26.282

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:30.319
SHORT ANSWER IS HOW. DO YOU GET

FUNDING- SO NOW AND SOME COURTS

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:40.229
A LOT OF COURSE HAVE JUDGES

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:41.931
WRITING GRADING GRANTS I MEAN

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:43.366
THAT'S HOW HOW MUCH LITTLE

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.334
SUPPORT THERE IS OUT THERE BUT

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:48.538

THEIR LIMIT THERE WILL THERE

01:01:57.413 --> 01:01:58.915
LIMITED TIME WISE TOO SO

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:00.383
THERE'S NOTHING THAT GIVES THE

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.851
SECURITY WITH THOSE GRANTS.

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.319

FUNDING THAT THAT WE CAN GO TO

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:28.077

BUDGET WAS INCREASED BASED ON

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:09.611
AN EXPECTATION OF FEDERAL

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:12.247

THAT THOSE- INCREASES AND

PROJECTED FEDERAL FUNDS WE

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:28.496
WOULD HAVE FINALLY BEEN IN A

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.198
POSITION IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:33.735
WERE ABLE- TO ENSURE NO MORE

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:34.669

YEAR AND IN THE BUDGET YEAR ARE

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:53.121
FAR SHORT. OF WHAT WAS

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:54.689
PROJECTED. IN YEAR ONE WE DROVE

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.558
WE WERE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:57.892
TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

01:24:57.959 --> 01:25:00.195

BUDGET. THIS YEAR WE EXPECT

01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:08.403
THAT AT BEST WILL BE ABLE TO

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.805
DRIVE DOWN 75% OF WHAT WAS

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:13.875
PROJECTED AND PERHAPS UP 280%

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:18.413
NEXT YEAR. THERE ARE A LOT OF-

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.148
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:21.716
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHICH

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:24.252
I WILL GO INTO AT THIS TIME-

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:25.520
THE FEDERAL RULES KEEP

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:27.555
CHANGING- UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:29.190
BEEN PUT INTO A RETROACTIVE

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:31.159
BILLING SITUATION NOW TWO YEARS

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:34.596
IN A ROW WE HAVE. RIGHT HERE.

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:36.397
AND ALL OF THE FIRST YEAR WAS

01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:38.633
BUILT RETROACTIVELY AS WELL WE

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.702
HAD MEAN RECEIVED REMAINING

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:41.703
WOULD BE AT THE VARIOUS

01:25:41.769 --> 01:25:44.038
ATTORNEY GROUPS. ONLY JUST

01:25:44.105 --> 01:25:45.974
RECEIVED THE RULES FOR CLAIMING

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.042
FOR THE CURRENT YEAR- A FEW

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:49.310
WEEKS AGO AND THEY HAVE THEY

01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:50.578
HAVE YET TO BE COMPLETELY

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.280
FINALIZED I WAS ON A PHONE CALL

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:53.448
THIS MORNING WHERE CHANGES WERE

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:55.950
AGAIN. I'M BEING DISCUSSED AND

01:25:56.017 --> 01:25:58.486
CLARITY SOUGHT AND CERTAIN FINE

01:25:58.553 --> 01:25:59.621
POINTS PUT ON THE CLEANING

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.723
RULES SO WE WILL BE CLAIMING

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:03.558
RETROACTIVELY AGAIN THIS YEAR.

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:06.027
AND IN SOME SITUATIONS WILL BE

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:06.561
LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:08.696
BECAUSE THE RULES AS I SAID THE

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:10.598
RULES HAVE CHANGED. AND THE

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:13.434
DOCUMENTATION THAT IS REQUIRED.

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.136
TO CLAIM FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:16.371
IS NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE WE

01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:18.072
DIDN'T KNOW AND TELL THE PAST

01:26:18.139 --> 01:26:19.374
COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT WE NEEDED

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.242
THAT DOCUMENTATION. YEAH THE

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:22.710
CLAIMING AND BILLING IT GOES

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:24.679
BACK TO JULY ONE AND WE CAN'T

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:26.648
RETROACTIVELY CREATE RECORDS

01:26:26.714 --> 01:26:30.285
FOR EXAMPLE. TIME RECORDS THAT

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:32.320
DON'T EXIST. THESE AND- OF A

01:26:32.387 --> 01:26:35.690
VERY. IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO-

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:37.425
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:40.161
WONDERFUL FEDERAL OPPORTUNITY.

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:43.164
THE SECOND OF. AND SO I WILL BE

01:26:43.231 --> 01:26:45.199
IN LOOKING AT MY ORGANIZATION

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:46.834
AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THIS CURRENT

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:48.536
YEAR OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:50.104
CURRENT YEAR WE ANTICIPATE THAT

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:52.807
OUR MATCH RATE IS ONLY GONNA BE

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.742
67% OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO US

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:56.277
ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN

01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:57.845
OUR ABILITY TO TAKE FULL

01:26:57.912 --> 01:26:59.681
ADVANTAGE IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:02.250
ABILITY TO TAKE FULL. IS THAT

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:05.753
WHEN THE PROGRAM. FIRST STARTED

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:09.557
THEY EXPECTED A 59% PENETRATION

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:11.426
RATE FOR THREE YEARS WE THEN

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:14.896
LATER LEARNED FROM- FROM THE

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:17.432
JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT THAT HAD

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:18.232
BEEN ARONIE EASILY

01:27:18.299 --> 01:27:20.301
COMMUNICATED- THROUGH THE

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:21.636
CONTRACTING PROCESS NOT NOT

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:22.837
THROUGH ANY FAULT OF JUDICIAL

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:25.006
COUNCIL THAT YOU CHANGES- AT

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:27.609
THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND IT THE

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.410
PENETRATION RATE IS ACTUALLY IT

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:32.547
WAS 59% THE FIRST YEAR 55% THE

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:34.148
SECOND CAR A YEAR AND WILL ONLY

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:37.051
BE 54% IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO AN

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:39.921
AUTOMATIC 5% REDUCTION IN THE

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:42.290
EXPECTED MATCH- THAT IS OUT OF

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:43.858
EVERYONE'S CONTROL.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:45.059
ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE A LARGE

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:46.961
NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:49.063
EITHER MANDATED BY STATE LAW OR

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.999
DRIVEN BY BEST PRACTICES THAT

01:27:51.065 --> 01:27:52.000
DO NOT MEET THE FEDERAL

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:53.835
REQUIREMENTS FOR MATCHING AND

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:56.004
MANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES- ARE

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:57.572
ARE PRACTICES THAT THIS

01:27:57.639 --> 01:28:01.009
LEGISLATURE. I HAVE- RECOGNIZE

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:02.644
AS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:04.479
SERVING FAMILIES AND CHILDREN

01:28:04.545 --> 01:28:06.280
IN THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM. FOR

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:07.649
EXAMPLE SOME OF OUR MOST

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:09.217
IMPORTANT PRACTICES AROUND

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:10.284
MULTI DISCIPLINARY

01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:11.586
REPRESENTATION OF CHILDREN

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:12.553
WHO'VE BEEN VICTIMS OF

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.522
COMMERCIAL SEX TRAFFICKING WILL

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:17.392
NOT BE MATCH BALL SIMILARLY ARE

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.793
VERY INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.128
ARE IN PLACE TO SERVE YOUNG

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:21.462
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FOSTER CARE

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:22.697
WHO BEEN ARRESTED THOSE

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:24.499
ACTIVITIES WILL NOT BE MATCH OF

01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:26.134
ALL THE USE OF PARA PARTNERS

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.102
AND HERE ADVOCATES WHICH IS. A

01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:29.737
SHINING EXAMPLE OF- BUT A

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.072
PRACTICE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:32.407
LED THE WAY OF HAVING PEOPLE OF

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:33.574
LIVED EXPERIENCE WORKING

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:35.510
ALONGSIDE LAWYERS TO PROVIDE

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.412
BETTER SERVICES TO PARENTS AND

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.646
CHILDREN SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:40.748
THEY ENGAGE ON A DAILY BASIS

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:42.650
WILL NOT BE MATCH OF ALL. SOME

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:44.318
OF OUR TRAINING IS NOT MAGICAL

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:45.586
I COULD GO ON THERE'S A BUS

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:47.155
UNFORTUNATELY A FAIRLY LONG

01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.456
LIST OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:49.891
MATCH OF ALL TIME TO AN

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:51.559
ATTORNEY SPENDS IN A STAFF

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:53.494
MEETING IS NOT MAGICAL. SO IT

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:54.195
IS BECAUSE BECOME

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:56.064
MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:59.267
REACH THE MATCH THE SECOND VERY

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:00.535
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE THAT WE

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:02.070
HAVE REBATES BACK TO THE

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:03.971
RETROACTIVE BILLING PROBLEMS

01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:06.040
AND THAT IS BECAUSE THE MATCH

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:08.409
ASSUMES THAT THE PRIOR YEAR'S

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:10.878
MATCH WILL ALSO BE MATCHED WE

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:17.251
HAVE TO SPEND IT TO MATCH IT WE.

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:17.885
HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE FUNDING AT

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:18.553
SO WE CAN IT SPEND IT SO WE

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:20.021
CAN'T MATCH IT. ONCE AGAIN. THE

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:20.988
DOMINO EFFECT WHERE IT WILL BE

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:22.724
A HOW. TO THE FULL FAT MATCH.

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.492
IN LAST GET A JUMP START ON THE

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:25.993
FEDERAL FUNDING STREAM BY

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.729
INCREASING THE STATE FUNDING AS

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:29.330
RECOMMENDED BY UP TO THIRTY

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:31.232
MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR UNTIL

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:33.568
WE CAN REALIZE A GREATER SHARE.

01:29:33.634 --> 01:29:34.068
OF THE AVAILABLE FEDERAL

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:38.406
FUNDING. I'LL NOW TURN TO THE

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:40.374
ADDITIONAL. ONE TIME TEN

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:42.410
MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST. WHICH

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:44.812
WE WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT- IS

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.714
A IS A CONSERVATIVE REQUEST AND

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:49.083
IT COMES FROM TWO PRIMARY AREAS

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:50.785
THE FIRST IS THE CASELOADS.

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:52.987
WHICH YOU MAY BE AWARE OF- HIS

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.322
BEEN REPORTED IN A VARIETY OF

01:29:54.388 --> 01:29:56.991
VENUES AND IS IN THE MATERIALS-

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:59.427
THERE'S BEEN A 7% INCREASE. IN

01:29:59.494 --> 01:30:00.962
CASELOAD IN THE DEPENDENCY

01:30:01.028 --> 01:30:03.397
SYSTEM STATEWIDE AND 14% OF

THAT IS PROJECTED IN THE BUDGET

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:47.809

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.343
NINE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE.

PEOPLE WITHOUT CAMERAS MAKING

01:39:51.352 --> 01:39:53.387
IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCERN WHO

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:55.823
WAS SPEAKING AND WHEN- WE EVEN

01:39:55.889 --> 01:39:57.958

SPEAKERS AND THEY WERE ALL ON

01:40:05.432 --> 01:40:06.700
ONE PHONE LINE AND OUR COURT

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:08.435
REPORTER WAS COMPLETELY UNABLE

TO DISCERN WHO IS SPEAKING OR

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:12.773
WHAT WAS BEING SAID. BUT THE

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.308
EXISTING TECHNOLOGY JUST DOES

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.443
NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE IN

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:19.046
ORDER TO ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:21.348

LIMITED ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY-

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:30.924
HOW DO THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:32.459
SYSTEM EQUALLY AND GET EQUAL

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:34.595
ACCESS uJUSTICE.

01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:36.530
CORTESE MADE A POINT ABOUT

01:40:36.597 --> 01:40:38.499
REALLY LIMITING THE TYPES OF

01:40:38.565 --> 01:40:40.000
PROCEEDINGS BUT EVEN WITHIN

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:42.169
THAT WHEN YOU DRILL DOWN THERE

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.904
ARE IMPLICATIONS THAT HAVEN'T

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:45.873
BEEN CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THERE

01:40:45.939 --> 01:40:47.307
ARE- CRIMES OF MORAL TO.

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:49.109
TURPITUDE THAT ARE YOU KNOW ON

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:50.944
THE FEDERAL LISTS THAT ARE ONLY

01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:52.946
INFRACTIONS BUT IF YOU PLEAD

01:40:53.013 --> 01:40:56.216
DOWN FROM A MISDEMEANOR- THERE

01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:57.718
ARE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES TO

01:40:57.785 --> 01:41:00.320
THAT SO WE CANNOT PUT ANYBODY

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:02.523
AT A DISADVANTAGE PARTICULARLY

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:04.091
THOSE. THAT ARE ALREADY SAYS

01:41:04.158 --> 01:41:05.058

DISENFRANCHISED IN ANY OTHER

01:41:07.928 --> 01:41:11.465
WAY- SO WE STRONGLY URGE THE

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:14.735
COMMITTEE TO REJECT THE TBL- TO

01:41:14.802 --> 01:41:16.637

PERMANENT AND INSTEAD REALLY.

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:23.610
TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT THE

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:25.712
EXPERIENCE OF COURT USERS AND

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:27.581
COURT WORKERS- DURING THE

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:31.685
PANDEMIC. ON IN CLOSING- THE

01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:35.556
DRAMATICALLY UNDERFUNDED BUT

01:41:35.622 --> 01:41:37.057
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE REALLY

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:40.627
ARE SEEING IS THAT THE FUNDING

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:42.729
IS NOT BEING DEDICATED AND

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:44.998
DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN

01:41:45.065 --> 01:41:46.800
SUCH A WAY THAT THE JUDICIAL

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:49.269

ENSURE THAT CORPORATIONS CAN

01:41:53.106 --> 01:41:55.709
CONTINUE. AND SO ANY ADDITIONAL

OBVIOUSLY IN SOME CASES- WE

01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:59.640
WOULD PREFER IN PERSON AND LIKE

IN THE INSTANCE OF A JURY TRIAL

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:02.943

FLEXIBILITY THAT REMOTE

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:31.972
PROCEEDINGS OFFER BUT WE ARE

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.907
OPPOSED TO THE LANGUAGE AS IT

IS IN THE TRAILER BUDGET BILL

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:37.477
AT THIS TIME- BECAUSE IT DOES

01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:39.646
NOT PROVIDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:41.148
THE LEAD AGAINST TO HAVE A SAY

REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:46.153
REMOTELY WE THINK THE LANGUAGE

01:43:46.219 --> 01:43:47.688
THAT APPLIES TO THE INFRACTIONS

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:49.923
IS MORE APPROPRIATE. THAN A

01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:51.058
LANGUAGE THAT IS MUCH MORE

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:52.926

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:07.274
THAN THE VIEW FROM THE WELL-

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:08.275
AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

01:44:08.342 --> 01:44:09.876
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE REMOTE

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:11.645
PROCESS IS EXCELLENT IN OTHERS

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:12.946
WHERE IT IS RIGHT VERY VERY

01:44:13.013 --> 01:44:15.182
CHALLENGING IT DOES NOT ALWAYS.

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:17.517
PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE

01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:18.385

OVERSEE FACILITIES THAT ARE

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:17.209
INSPECTED BY THE PROGRAM.

02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:19.278
STATUTE CURRENTLY REQUIRES THE

02:00:19.345 --> 02:00:22.815
SEC TO DO THREE THANKS ONE

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:24.183
REVISE THE STAIR CONSIDER

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:25.952
REVISING THE STANDARDS ONCE

02:00:26.018 --> 02:00:27.820
EVERY TWO YEARS AND THE SEC

02:00:27.887 --> 02:00:30.556
DOES THIS ESSENTIALLY THROUGH-

02:00:30.623 --> 02:00:33.159
VOLUNTEER WORKING GROUP'S THAT

02:00:33.225 --> 02:00:33.726
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

BOARD. TO INSPECT EACH FACILITY

02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:39.098
ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS WHICH THE

FCC DOES THROUGH A- TEAM OF

02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:44.503

LEGISLATURE EVERY OTHER YEAR.

02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:54.246
AND I ALSO WANT TO KNOW THE BSE

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:56.248
IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE

02:00:56.315 --> 02:00:58.918
THE STANDARDS. IT DOES HOWEVER

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:00.086
PROVIDE SOME TECHNICAL

02:01:00.152 --> 02:01:01.654
ASSISTANCE AS IT GOES ABOUT

02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:04.056
ITS- INSPECTION ACTIVITIES

02:01:04.123 --> 02:01:05.391
THOUGH IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:07.793
STATUTORILY. IN THE BUDGET FOR

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.528
THE PROGRAM IS ABOUT TWO POINT

02:01:09.595 --> 02:01:11.497
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY.

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:15.835
AND AS WAS MENTIONED- AB I MISS

02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:18.104
HOWARD DAY GOVERNOR IN JANUARY

02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:19.438
TWENTY TWENTY DIRECTED THE SEC

02:01:19.505 --> 02:01:21.273
TO MAKE THREE CHANGES TO THE

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:24.577
PROGRAM AND CITING- CITING

02:01:24.644 --> 02:01:25.945
INADEQUATE OR INSUFFICIENT

02:01:26.012 --> 02:01:28.280
OVERSIGHT AND JAILS AS PART OF

02:01:28.347 --> 02:01:30.282
HIS RATIONALE FOR THOSE CHANGES

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:31.984
AND THOSE ARE TWO ONE ALIGN

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:33.953
STANDARDS WITH BEST PRACTICE

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:35.021
YES YOU SEE INDICATES THAT

02:01:35.087 --> 02:01:36.822
THEY'RE DOING THIS- BY

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:38.190
PROVIDING THE WORK GROUPS THAT

02:01:38.257 --> 02:01:39.225
CONSIDER REVISIONS TO THE

02:01:39.291 --> 02:01:40.559
STANDARD WITH. ADDITIONAL

02:01:40.626 --> 02:01:42.161
MATERIALS TO REVIEW ON WHAT

02:01:42.228 --> 02:01:45.398
MIGHT BE BEST PRACTICES- FOR

02:01:45.464 --> 02:01:46.065
DIFFERENT LOCAL DETENTION

02:01:46.132 --> 02:01:48.367
FACILITIES TO CONDUCT

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:49.435
ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS AND

02:01:49.502 --> 02:01:50.469
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AT

02:01:50.536 --> 02:01:51.804
FACILITIES WITH A HISTORY OF

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:54.073
NON COMPLIANCE WHICH UP UNTIL

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.675
THIS- APRIL FINANCE LETTER

02:01:55.741 --> 02:01:57.476
WHICH I'LL DISCUSS IN A MOMENT-

02:01:57.543 --> 02:01:58.844
THE SEC HAD INDICATED IT WOULD

02:01:58.911 --> 02:02:00.813
DO WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.748
WAS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO BE

02:02:02.815 --> 02:02:04.817
STEPPING UP INSPECTIONS- DOING

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:06.886
SOME ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS AND

02:02:06.952 --> 02:02:08.688
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- WITHIN

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:10.222
EXISTING RESOURCES BUT NOW IT'S

02:02:10.289 --> 02:02:11.624
REQUESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

02:02:11.691 --> 02:02:16.028
TO GO FURTHER. ESSENTIALLY- AND

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:17.363
THEN THREE TO INVITE LEADERS OF

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:18.731
NON COME AS A TO PUBLIC

02:02:18.798 --> 02:02:20.733
MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THAT

02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:22.201
REASONS BEHIND THEIR- NON

02:02:22.268 --> 02:02:24.236
COMPLIANCE. AND SO MOVING INTO

02:02:24.303 --> 02:02:26.739
OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM

02:02:26.806 --> 02:02:28.507
AND IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE.

02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:29.942
WHEN WE LOOK AT ANY PROGRAM WE

02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:30.976
ASK WHAT IS THE MISSION AND

02:02:31.043 --> 02:02:32.278
GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM IS IT

02:02:32.344 --> 02:02:34.046
MEETING THOSE GOALS. AND IN

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:35.648
THIS CASE WE FOUND THAT THE

02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:36.515
MISSION AND GOALS OF THE

02:02:36.582 --> 02:02:38.651
PROGRAM ARE NOT CLEAR AND THAT

02:02:38.718 --> 02:02:39.685
LEAVES DISCRETION TO THE

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:40.853
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE LIKE I

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.354
SAID THERE'S THREE PRETTY.

02:02:42.421 --> 02:02:44.623
SIMPLE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS

02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:46.592
AND THAT THE PROGRAM MUST FILL

02:02:46.659 --> 02:02:48.127
AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF

02:02:48.194 --> 02:02:49.729
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT A PROGRAM

02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:52.264
COULD FULFILL THOSE- AND IN

02:02:52.331 --> 02:02:53.499
TURN PURSUE A VARIETY OF

02:02:53.566 --> 02:02:56.502
DIFFERENT. GOALS IN DOING SO-

02:02:56.569 --> 02:02:58.104
FOR EXAMPLE ONE CAN WRITE A

02:02:58.170 --> 02:03:01.140
REPORT THAT'S GEARED TOWARD

02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:03.008
PRIMARILY AN AUDIENCE OF-

02:03:03.075 --> 02:03:04.043
CORRECTIONAL ADMINISTRATORS OR

02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:04.977
ONE COULD WRITE A REPORT GEARED

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:07.179
TOWARD- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC

02:03:07.246 --> 02:03:08.180
BOTH WOULD FILL THE STATUTORY

02:03:08.247 --> 02:03:10.015
REQUIREMENT BUT EACH WOULD

02:03:10.082 --> 02:03:12.885
ACHIEVE A DIFFERENT GOAL- AND

02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:14.353
SO THIS LACK OF GOALS. AND

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:15.821
CLEAR GOALS AND MISSION IN

02:03:15.888 --> 02:03:17.523
ADDITION MAKING IT DIFFICULT

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:18.424
FOR US TO EVALUATE THE

02:03:18.491 --> 02:03:19.458
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM

02:03:19.525 --> 02:03:21.393
ALSO UNDERMINES LEGISLATIVE

02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:23.796
OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM. SO AT

02:03:23.863 --> 02:03:24.163
A HIGH LEVEL OUR

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.631
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TO

02:03:25.698 --> 02:03:26.999
ESTABLISH A CLEAR MISSION AND

02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:28.134
GOALS AND STATUTES FOR THE

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:30.336
PROGRAM. AND THEN TO ALIGN THE

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:32.872
MEMBERSHIP OF THE BOARD- I'M IN

02:03:32.938 --> 02:03:35.141
THE PROGRAM STRUCTURE ITSELF

02:03:35.207 --> 02:03:36.776
WITH THOSE MISSION AND GOALS.

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:37.810
AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:40.346
COULD USE ANY GOALS- THAT IT.

02:03:40.412 --> 02:03:42.948
DESIRES BUT WE IN OUR REPORT

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:45.551
DIDN'T RECOMMEND AND CERTAIN

02:03:45.618 --> 02:03:46.819
GOAL AND MISSION AND CERTAIN

02:03:46.886 --> 02:03:48.621
GOALS. AND NOT RECOMMENDED

02:03:48.687 --> 02:03:49.655
MISSION IS TO PROMOTE LEGAL

02:03:49.722 --> 02:03:52.057
HUMANE AND SAFETY CONDITIONS IN

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.826
LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES. AND

02:03:53.893 --> 02:03:56.262
THEN THE GOALS- WE RECOMMEND

02:03:56.328 --> 02:03:58.497
FOR SPECIFICALLY- TO SUPPORT

02:03:58.564 --> 02:04:00.599
THAT BROADER MISSION. WE CAME

02:04:00.666 --> 02:04:01.667
UP WITH THESE GOALS BY THINKING

02:04:01.734 --> 02:04:03.335
ABOUT. BEST PRACTICE LOOKING

02:04:03.402 --> 02:04:05.337
OPSEC CURRENTLY DOES TALKING TO

02:04:05.404 --> 02:04:06.639
VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS EXCITER

02:04:06.705 --> 02:04:07.973
AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT DOESN'T

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:09.208
MAKE SENSE FOR THE STATE TO DO

02:04:09.275 --> 02:04:11.544
VERSUS OTHER. ENTITIES IN THIS

02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:13.012
OVER OUR OVERALL KIND OF

02:04:13.078 --> 02:04:15.314
OVERSIGHT ECOSYSTEM AROUND-

02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:16.749
LOCAL JAILS- LOCAL DETENTION

02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:18.918
FACILITIES AND THOSE GOALS WE

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:19.652
CAME UP WITH AND RECOMMEND OUR

02:04:19.718 --> 02:04:21.453
ONE. HOPE LOCAL LEADERS

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.655
DETERMINE AND MEET LEGAL

02:04:22.721 --> 02:04:24.857
REQUIREMENTS- AROUND DETENTION

02:04:24.924 --> 02:04:27.593
FACILITY OPERATIONS THIS IS-

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:28.961
WHAT WE HAVEN'T COME TO

02:04:29.028 --> 02:04:30.830
UNDERSTAND IT SEEMS IS BY AND

02:04:30.896 --> 02:04:32.298
LARGE WHAT HOW THE S. THE

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:34.400
PRIMARY GOAL THAT THE FCC HAS

02:04:34.466 --> 02:04:38.938
SORT OF BEEN FORMALLY OPERATED.

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:40.673
AND TOWARD IF YOU WILL AND THEN

02:04:40.739 --> 02:04:42.975
VIEW BY AND LARGE WHAT PROPOSED

02:04:43.042 --> 02:04:44.176
CHANGES CAN TO SUPPORT WHICH

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:46.145
I'LL GET INTO IN A MINUTE- BUT

02:04:46.212 --> 02:04:47.313
WE RECOMMEND AND WE DO THINK

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:48.948
THAT'S A LOT OF- AN IMPORTANT

02:04:49.014 --> 02:04:50.416
GOAL SO WE RECOMMEND.

02:04:50.482 --> 02:04:52.251
ESTABLISHING THAT AS A GOAL WE

02:04:52.318 --> 02:04:54.386
ALSO RECOMMEND ESTABLISHING AND

02:04:54.453 --> 02:04:55.955
THREE MORE SAID THE SECOND ONE

02:04:56.021 --> 02:04:56.655
BEING TO FACILITATE

02:04:56.722 --> 02:04:58.591
TRANSPARENCY SO THAT LOCAL

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:00.159
LEADERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. CAN

02:05:00.226 --> 02:05:01.794
HOLD FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:03.929
SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO.

02:05:03.996 --> 02:05:04.864
THREE TO PROMOTE EQUITABLE

02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:06.198
PROVISION OF LEGAL HUMANE AND

02:05:06.265 --> 02:05:08.067
SAFE CONDITIONS AND FOR TO

02:05:08.133 --> 02:05:09.168
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:11.971
AND STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP TO

02:05:12.037 --> 02:05:13.539
FACILITATE SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT.

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:15.474
AND WE RECOMMEND- LIKE I SAID

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:18.777
THAT THE LEGISLATURE- I AM

02:05:18.844 --> 02:05:21.280
REVISED STATUTE TO CHANGE BOARD

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:23.249
MEMBERSHIP TO ALIGN WITH THESE-

02:05:23.315 --> 02:05:24.550
GOALS BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THE

02:05:24.617 --> 02:05:26.118
CURRENT BOARD IS NOT ALIGNED

02:05:26.185 --> 02:05:29.688
WITH THOSE FOUR GOALS. AND IN

02:05:29.755 --> 02:05:32.458
ADDITION TO REQUIRE EIGHT

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:33.492
SPECIFICALLY WE FOUND THAT

02:05:33.559 --> 02:05:35.327
THERE WAS A LACK OF- MEMBERSHIP

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:36.762
DESIGNATED SLOTS FOR PEOPLE

02:05:36.829 --> 02:05:38.898
WITH PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE. IN

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:41.533
AN AFGHAN ADVOCACY AND

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.001
OVERSIGHT OF DETENTION

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:43.769
CONDITIONS- AND THEN WE

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:45.537
RECOMMEND DIRECTING THE SEC TO

02:05:45.604 --> 02:05:46.839
PROVIDE A PLAN TO THE

02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:48.073
LEGISLATURE AND HOW IT WILL

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:50.009
ALIGN THE PROGRAM WITH WHATEVER

02:05:50.075 --> 02:05:52.478
GOALS THE LEGISLATURE SETS- AND

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:54.213
IN. KEEPING WITH THE FOUR GOALS

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.781
THAT WE RECOMMEND WE CAME UP

02:05:55.848 --> 02:05:57.283
WITH SPECIFIC ELEMENTS WHICH WE

02:05:57.349 --> 02:05:58.984
DESCRIBE IN DETAIL MORE DETAIL

02:05:59.051 --> 02:06:00.819
IN THE REPORT AND WE THINK THE

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:03.722
PLAN SHOULD HAVE- AND THESE

02:06:03.789 --> 02:06:06.592
THESE INCLUDE- I PLAN TO CREATE

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:08.527
MORE SPECIFIC. STANDARDS

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:09.428
BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THE

02:06:09.495 --> 02:06:10.562
STANDARDS WE THINK ARE NOT

02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:12.398
SPECIFIC ENOUGH- AS WELL AS A

02:06:12.464 --> 02:06:13.899
PLAN TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:17.536
STANDARDS ARE EQUITABLE- AND IN

02:06:17.603 --> 02:06:18.771
ORDER TO MAKE THESE CHANGES WE

02:06:18.837 --> 02:06:19.638
THINK THERE NEED TO BE SOME

02:06:19.705 --> 02:06:21.240
CHANGES TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF

02:06:21.307 --> 02:06:23.609
THE WORK GROUPS. AND SO THERE'S

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:24.810
A VARIETY OF OTHER ELEMENTS OF

02:06:24.877 --> 02:06:26.512
THIS PURPOSE- OF THIS PLAN THAT

02:06:26.578 --> 02:06:27.713
SHE ALMONDS THAT WE THINK

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:31.016
SHOULD BE IN THIS PLAN- THAT WE

02:06:31.083 --> 02:06:32.051
LAID OUT IN THE REPORT AND

02:06:32.117 --> 02:06:34.053
HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL IF

02:06:34.119 --> 02:06:37.389
ANY OF THAT- MEMBERS WOULD LIKE.

02:06:37.456 --> 02:06:39.558
BUT IN ANY OF TIME I WILL. AND

02:06:39.625 --> 02:06:42.094
MOVE ON. I JUST WANT TO MAKE

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:43.696
AND FIRST OF ALL BEFORE MOVING

02:06:43.762 --> 02:06:44.897
ON- RECORDS ON THE APRIL

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.598
FINANCE LETTER I DIDN'T WANT TO

02:06:46.665 --> 02:06:48.434
KNOW WHEN. WHEN HE PIECE ABOUT

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.536
OUR REPORT IS THAT. ONE ELEMENT

02:06:50.602 --> 02:06:52.538
THAT IS NOT- WE DO NOT

02:06:52.604 --> 02:06:53.939
NECESSARILY RECOMMEND

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:55.174
EXPLICITLY BE INCLUDED IN THE

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:57.076
PLAN. IS AN ENFORCEMENT

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:58.944
MECHANISM NBCC HAS MENTIONED

02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:00.112
DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE AN

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:03.182
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM- THE

02:07:03.248 --> 02:07:03.916
REASON WE DON'T. RECOMMEND

02:07:03.983 --> 02:07:05.317
ADDING ONE NECESSARILY IS

02:07:05.384 --> 02:07:07.453
BECAUSE THERE IS- CURRENTLY AN

02:07:07.519 --> 02:07:08.554
ATTORNEY GENERAL OPINION

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:09.855
LONGSTANDING OPINION.

02:07:09.922 --> 02:07:11.256
DETERMINING THAT THE STANDARDS

02:07:11.323 --> 02:07:13.092
ARE NOT STATE I'M REIMBURSABLE

02:07:13.158 --> 02:07:14.793
MANDATES BECAUSE THE FCC

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:15.928
DOESN'T HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:17.296
MECHANISM. SO OUR

02:07:17.363 --> 02:07:18.931
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE KEY

02:07:18.998 --> 02:07:20.032
ELEMENTS THAT WE RECOMMEND THIS

02:07:20.099 --> 02:07:21.900
PLAN INCLUDED ARE CRAFTED VERY

02:07:21.967 --> 02:07:24.903
INTENTIONALLY- TO. USE

02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:26.739
TRANSPARENCY AND TECHNICAL SUCH

02:07:26.805 --> 02:07:28.907
ASSISTANCE AS MORE OF THE SORT

02:07:28.974 --> 02:07:30.009
OF STEERING OF CHANGES APPROACH

02:07:30.075 --> 02:07:32.911
AS OPPOSED TO ENFORCEMENT- IN

02:07:32.978 --> 02:07:35.314
AN ATTEMPT TO M. INTENTIONALLY

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:36.615
TO AVOID A POTENTIAL MANDATE

02:07:36.682 --> 02:07:39.685
BUT ALSO- MORE POSITION THE

02:07:39.752 --> 02:07:40.919
STATE TO BE ASSISTING LOCAL

02:07:40.986 --> 02:07:43.255
STATE STAKEHOLDERS- IN HOLDING

02:07:43.322 --> 02:07:44.723
THEIR FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE

02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:46.291
RATHER THAN THE STATE DOING IT

02:07:46.358 --> 02:07:48.627
THROUGH ENFORCEMENT- I JUST

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:50.863
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. AND THEN

02:07:50.929 --> 02:07:52.598
MOVING ON TO OUR COMMENTS ON

02:07:52.664 --> 02:07:55.934
THE BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU

02:07:56.001 --> 02:07:57.436
TODAY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:59.471
LEGISLATURE IT'S INTERESTED IN

02:07:59.538 --> 02:08:01.707
TAKING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS- FOR

02:08:01.774 --> 02:08:03.475
REFORMING THE BOARD. WE THINK

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:05.077
IT WOULD BE PROMOTE PREMATURE

02:08:05.144 --> 02:08:06.912
TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

02:08:06.979 --> 02:08:08.280
TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM AT THIS

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:09.882
TIME GIVEN THAT ONCE IT HAS

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:11.917
THIS PLAN DIED AND WE RECOMMEND

02:08:11.984 --> 02:08:14.186
IT. DIRECT THESEC TO PROVIDE

02:08:14.253 --> 02:08:15.154
WE THINK IT WOULD BE IN A MUCH

02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:16.255
BETTER POSITION TO ASSESS

02:08:16.321 --> 02:08:17.756
WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL

02:08:17.823 --> 02:08:19.558
RESOURCES ARE NEEDED FOR THE

02:08:19.625 --> 02:08:21.827
PROGRAM. HOWEVER ON THE FLIP

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:22.694
SIDE TO THE EXTENT THE

02:08:22.761 --> 02:08:24.963
LEGISLATURE CHOOSES NOT TO-

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:26.031
IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDED

02:08:26.098 --> 02:08:28.367
REFORMS THEN WE FIND THAT THE

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:28.834
PROPOSED EXPANSION IS

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:30.769
UNNECESSARY- AND THIS IS

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:33.072
BECAUSE- WE FIND THAT THE-

02:08:33.138 --> 02:08:34.907
CURRENT PROGRAM AS WELL AS AND

02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:36.608
THE PROPOSED EXPANSION WOULD BY

02:08:36.675 --> 02:08:38.343
AND LARGE SEEM TO SUPPORT. THE

02:08:38.410 --> 02:08:40.779
FCC'S CURRENT TERM INFORMAL

02:08:40.846 --> 02:08:42.614
GOAL OF PROVIDING SERVICE TO

02:08:42.681 --> 02:08:44.616
LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE FORM OF

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:46.452
HELPING THEM- DETERMINE MEET

02:08:46.518 --> 02:08:48.487
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND- WHAT

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:49.855
WELL THAT IS ONE OF THE GOALS

02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:52.057
WE RECOMMEND IT'S NOT. IT'S AND

02:08:52.124 --> 02:08:54.026
WE DO RECOMMEND THREE OTHER

02:08:54.093 --> 02:08:55.694
GOALS WHICH AND BY AND LARGE

02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:57.796
THAT DOES SEEM TO BE THE AREAS-

02:08:57.863 --> 02:08:59.131
WHEN WE LOOKED AT AT AT WHERE

02:08:59.198 --> 02:09:00.265
THE PROGRAM WE NEED IT AND THE

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:01.733
BOARD AND THANK AND SUCH WOULD

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:03.435
NEED TO BE REFORMED. TO ME WE

02:09:03.502 --> 02:09:06.071
DID NOT WE HAVEN'T HEARD- AND

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:07.673
THE SEC WAS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:09:07.739 --> 02:09:09.408
EVIDENCE THAT LOCAL AGENCIES

02:09:09.475 --> 02:09:13.278
ARE. DISSATISFIED. WITH THE

02:09:13.345 --> 02:09:13.879
CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE THEY

02:09:13.946 --> 02:09:15.681
RECEIVE. FROM BSE. AND THEN

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:17.783
FINALLY. SO JUST TO WRAP THAT

02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:19.518
UP THAT HE SAID WE RECOMMEND

02:09:19.585 --> 02:09:20.953
REJECTING THE PROPOSED STAFFING

02:09:21.019 --> 02:09:23.455
AND ASSOCIATED RESOURCES-

02:09:23.522 --> 02:09:24.923
BECAUSE OF PREMATURE IF THE

02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:25.891
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO GO WITH

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:27.025
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND AN

02:09:27.092 --> 02:09:28.827
UNNECESSARY IF THE LEGISLATURE

02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:30.062
CHOOSES. NOT TO REFORM THE

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:32.464
BOARD- BUT THERE ISN'T THERE

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:33.799
ARE TWO SMALL PIECES WE DO

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:36.268
RECOMMEND APPROVING ONE IS A

02:09:36.335 --> 02:09:37.736
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:09:37.803 --> 02:09:40.839
ANNUALLY ON GOING TO- SO THAT

02:09:40.906 --> 02:09:42.741
TO FIND A CONTRACT TO ALLOW

02:09:42.808 --> 02:09:44.776
INSPECTORS TO IN- INPUT DATA

02:09:44.843 --> 02:09:46.478
ELECTRONICALLY WHILE THEY'RE

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:47.479
DOING INSPECTIONS WHICH WE

02:09:47.546 --> 02:09:49.615
THINK. WOULD BE A USEFUL TOOL

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:51.884
FOR THEM. I AND THEN BUDGET

02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:53.919
TRAILER LEGISLATION THAT WOULD.

02:09:53.986 --> 02:09:54.920
ALLOW INSPECTORS TO DO

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:56.288
UNANNOUNCED VISITS BOTH OF

02:09:56.355 --> 02:09:57.589
THESE TOOLS WE THINK WOULD BE

02:09:57.656 --> 02:09:58.857
USEFUL UNDER THE CURRENT

02:09:58.924 --> 02:10:00.659
PROGRAM OR A POTENTIAL LAND

02:10:00.726 --> 02:10:02.261
REFORM PROGRAM IS WE RECOMMEND

02:10:02.327 --> 02:10:05.631
SO WE RECOMMEND GOING AHEAD AND

02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:06.331
IMPROVING DOES- AND THEN I'M

02:10:06.398 --> 02:10:08.967

RESOURCES ARE CURRENTLY

02:10:26.952 --> 02:10:28.587
UNNECESSARY BUT WE REALLY DO

02:10:28.654 --> 02:10:30.722

ACTUALLY DOES STRENGTH AND

02:10:32.157 --> 02:10:33.192
BETTER OVERSIGHT OF COUNTY

02:10:33.258 --> 02:10:35.160

APPEAR BEFORE THE BOARD. REALLY

02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:46.004
DOES INCREASE OVERALL

02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:47.706
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

02:10:47.773 --> 02:10:49.408
BY ENGAGING THE PUBLIC IN THE

02:10:49.474 --> 02:10:51.510

02:10:51.577 --> 02:10:52.945
INSPECTIONS AND WATER FOUND

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:55.447

ACCESSIBLE REPORTS AND FINDINGS

02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:16.501
OF WHAT THE SEC INSPECTORS FIND

02:11:16.568 --> 02:11:17.402
WHEN THEY DO THE ANNUAL

02:11:17.469 --> 02:11:18.971
INSPECTIONS. AND AGAIN JUST

02:11:19.037 --> 02:11:20.172
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:21.640
INSPECTIONS WE THINK IT. IS A

02:11:21.707 --> 02:11:24.009
MUCH BETTER USE OF RESOURCES

02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:25.244
BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:26.612
ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:28.847
BMCC INSPECTORS TO FIND

02:11:28.914 --> 02:11:29.881

COMPLIANCE AND THEN AGAIN

ATTENTIVE TO INCREASING.

02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:50.869

WHAT MR EDELMAN HAS SAID- WE

02:11:57.009 --> 02:11:58.677
THINK IT REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY

02:11:58.744 --> 02:12:01.580
INCREASES PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

02:12:01.647 --> 02:12:03.382
ABOUT WHAT OUR INSPECTION

02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:07.853
PROCESS IS FINDING. THANK YOU.

02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:10.589
I DO THINK OF THERE IS A

02:12:10.656 --> 02:12:13.458
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM HERE. FOUR

02:12:13.525 --> 02:12:14.593
NINE IN AUGUST THERE'S SOME

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.795
LEGAL ISSUES ABOUT THE BSE SEE

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:19.731
NOT BEING AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE

02:12:19.798 --> 02:12:22.634
OUR OUR STANDARDS AND SO DOING

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:25.904
THE INSPECTIONS AND TAKING

02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:28.840
CERTAIN STEPS. OF SORT OF SEEMS

02:12:28.907 --> 02:12:30.375
TO GO AROUND THE EDGES INSTEAD

02:12:30.442 --> 02:12:32.778
OF RIGHT TO THE CORE OF THE

02:12:32.844 --> 02:12:36.415
ISSUE- IF THE STATE LAW DOES

02:12:36.481 --> 02:12:37.916
NOT AUTHORIZE I DON'T KNOW IF

02:12:37.983 --> 02:12:40.419
THERE'S A WAY OF FIXING THAT.

02:12:40.485 --> 02:12:42.454
BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME MORE

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:44.956
DIRECT TEETH PUT INTO THIS IT

02:12:45.023 --> 02:12:47.025
SEEMS TO ME THEN THE WAY THAT

02:12:47.092 --> 02:12:49.761
HAS BEEN DONE BECAUSE- OF WE

02:12:49.828 --> 02:12:51.096
CAN GO ON AND GIVE MORE AND

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:54.599
MORE RESOURCES. BUT WHERE IS

02:12:54.666 --> 02:12:56.201
THAT NON COMPLIANCE GOING TO BE

02:12:56.268 --> 02:12:58.370
RESOLVED. AND HOW'S IT GOING TO

02:12:58.437 --> 02:13:01.073
BE RESOLVED. I THINK TO ME

02:13:01.139 --> 02:13:05.377
THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG ISSUE OF.

02:13:05.444 --> 02:13:07.679
MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

02:13:07.746 --> 02:13:09.981
