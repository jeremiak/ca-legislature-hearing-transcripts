ALL RIGHT MISTER BERMAN THANK YOU MISTER EVANS. THE GERMAN IN COLLEGE AB SEVEN THIRTY SIX TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS THAT HE HAD THE TWENTY TWENTY. AS MORE MORE BAD ACTORS TRY TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS WITH MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS THAT SO CONFUSION AND DOUBT WITH VOTERS. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN VIDEO AUDIO AND IMAGES THAT THEY'RE BEING SHOWN HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED AND DO NOT REPRESENT REALITY WITH ABOUT SECOND THIS IS BECOME MORE CHALLENGING WITH THE INVENTION OF THE FACE. WHICH ARE EXTREMELY CONVINCING TRAVEL DID PHOTOS VIDEOS AND AUDIO RECORDINGS OF SOMEONE. TO SAY OR DO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY SAY OR DO I APOLOGIZE I GONNA. SINCE THIS IS A GUY I MET IN THIS UP OR SOMETHING THAT GOING TO IS A LITTLE BIT FOR OBVIOUS AS POSSIBLE. AB SEVEN THIRTY WOULD PROHIBIT A PERSON FAMILIAR ENTITY WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF AN ELECTION FROM DISTRIBUTING WITH ACTUAL MALICE MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE AUDIO OR VISUAL MEDIA WITH INTENT TO INJURE. THE CANDIDATES REPUTATION ORDER DECEIVER VOTER IN THE VOTING FOR AGAINST. IT AND ONCE THE MEDIA INCLUDES A DISCLOSURE STATING THAT IT IS BEING MANIPULATED. THE ABILITY TO A SPEECH IN CONTACT WITH CAñADA THAT IS FALSE THAT NEVER HAPPENED MAKES DEPICTS A POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS NEW TOOL IN THE ARSENAL OF THOSE THAT ONE WAY TO MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN. IN JANUARY THEN US DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DAN COATS ONE THAT HE TAKES WILL PROBABLY BE AMONG THE TACTICS USED TO DISRUPT THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM IT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE BUT I CONGRESS MEMBER ADAM SCHIFF CONVENE A HEARING ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MANIPULATE IMMEDIATE AND THE FACE. AND NOTED THAT THE FACE RAISE PROFOUND QUESTIONS ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE WITH INDIVIDUALS AND VOTERS NO LONGER ABLE TO TRUST THEIR OWN EYES OR YEARS. WHEN ASSESSING THE AUTHENTICITY OF WHAT THEY SEE ON THE SCREEN. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE ANY US SEVEN POLITICS HEARING SENATOR MARCO RUBIO SAID THAT HE EXPECTED THE CASE WILL BE USED. THE NEXT WAVE OF ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICAN WESTERN DEMOCRACIES. WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY OPTIONS ON A CORNER WE MUST DO MORE FOR THE PROLIFERATION OF THE FACE AN AUTOMOBILE RELATED MEDIA. I UNDERSTAND THEIR- CONCERNS BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT NO FOR THAT I'M AWARE OF HIS FOUNDED THE FIRST AND THEN THE- BRANCH SOMEONE THE RIGHT TO LITERALLY. THEIR WORDS I MIGHT. HE SAID. YOUR MEMBERS NEVER KALRA HAVE THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND ACLU IN OPPOSITION APPRECIATE. THE WORK AUTHOR HAS DONE IN TERMS OF AMENDMENTS BUT YOU STILL HAVE. THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IMPLICATIONS IN PARTICULAR THE TYPE OF CONTENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS CALL THE D. FATE FOR A REASON THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN IF THEY'RE REAL OR FAKE. AND SO IN IN FACT ASKING. A BROADCASTER OR ASKING THE CABLE NETWORKS TO POLICE THAT CONTENT. AND BE LIABLE IF THEY DO NOT JUST. YOU'RE CREATING REALLY A CHILLING SITUATION PARTICULARLY ON POLITICAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH BECAUSE THE DEFAULT IS TO BE TO NOT. JUST CLOSE ARE NOT AT A SEASON TO NOT ACTUALLY SURE THIS INFORMATION WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR SUBJECT TO LIKE LEAVE YOURSELF CAN BE VERIFIED CONTACT FEDERAL SO WE DO HAVE SUCH CONCERNS ABOUT THAT THERE'S AN ISSUES. THIS IS. CERTAINLY NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE WORKER DOING TEACHING IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. OKAY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE ONE THAT I HAD ON THE I MEAN I KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES HERE IS TRYING TO BE. AS NARROWLY TAILORED AS POSSIBLE TO GET I THINK THE ISSUE THE. THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH THESE DEEP FAKE VIDEOS THAT CAN BE USED TO SHOW SOMEONE SANE OR EXPRESSING SO THAT THEY CLEARLY DIDN'T SAY. ONE CONCERN HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN OUR ANALYSIS IS JUST THAT. THE WAY THE WORDING IS RIGHT NOW IF YOU COULD MAYBE ALSO APPLY TO LIKE LET'S SAY. AND I THINK THIS HAPPENS A LOT SOMEONE TAKES JUST A CLIP OF WHAT YOU SAID. YOU KNOW. AND SO IT'S IT IS MANIPULATING ITS MANIPULATE THE VIDEO. BY NOT GIVING YOU THE FULL CONTEXT BUT OF COURSE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME POLITICS RIGHT A I TOOK THE CLIP OF ONE PORTION OF YOUR SPEECH PUT THAT UP THERE. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY HEY THAT'S CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED SPEECH IT IS WHAT YOU SAID EVEN IF IT'S NOT. IN CONTEXT AND IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. AND IN THE HEAT OF A FOR YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES THAT POLITICAL SPEECH IS TREATED AS EXTRA PROTECTION. FOR THE- YEAH HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT YEAH I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN I DON'T THINK THAT. SITUATION APPLIES YEAH THIS SITUATION APPLIES IF YOU MANIPULATED CONTACT SO YOU'RE JUST PLACING A PART OF THE SPEECH. THAT'S A PART OF THE SPEECH AND IF YOU DON'T CHANGE THE TONE OR IF YOU DON'T TO CHANGE THE SPEED OR YOU DON'T CHANGE THE WORDS THAT ARE BEING SAID. THEN THEN I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO THAT SITUATION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY HAVE A BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. WE WANT TO CLOSER ANY CLASSROOM VOTE YEAH. AND QUIRK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AND THE MOTION IS WORTH RECOMMENDATION THAT THE SENATE. YEAH BERMAN AYE BERMAN AYE. GALLAGHER NINE THIRTY CAL BY. WELL I MEAN MAYES AYE MULLIN MULLIN. WHEREVER.
