GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS WILL BEGIN TODAY'S JOINT HEARING BETWEEN SUB ONE AND SUB TO. ON POTENTIAL PATH FORWARD IN ADDRESSING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND I WANTED TO START TODAY IF I COULD WITH A BIT OF EXCITEMENT IT'S. A RARITY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS INSPIRING AND POTENTIALLY A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS A STATE. TO FIND ADVANTAGES WITHIN OUR ABILITY TO LOOK AT TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND WHAT WE COULD DO TO BETTER MEET OUR KIDS WHERE THEY'RE AT. AND I'M EXCITED TO HEAR FROM THIS UPCOMING PANEL ABOUT POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR US AS A STATE. TO LOOK AT AS. WHAT WOULD WORK FOR US SO WITH THAT I WANTED OFFER IT TO A CO CHAIR HERE TODAY AND SEE IF HE HAD ANY WORDS? BEFORE WE BEGIN. WELL THANK YOU IT'S I I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE I'M CERTAINLY NOT THAT AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD I KNOW THAT. DOCTOR RAMBLE YOU EXPERIENCE THIS AS A PRACTITIONER IN MEDICINE. BUT I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT THE TOXIC STRESS OF ACES CONVERSATION RECENTLY LAST YEAR'S AND. START TALKING ABOUT ACES PEOPLE SAY OH YOU MEET ACES THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM.-AND SO THAT'S LITTLE LITTLE YOU THE FIRST. THE GOAL OF TODAY IS TO DIFFERENTIATE ADVERSE TELL EXPERIENCES WITH THE CALIFORNIA SAFE AFTER SCHOOL OUR PROGRAM. BUT SELL ALL SERIOUSNESS YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T TAKE ROCKET SCIENCE TO FIGURE OUT THAT THESE EXPERIENCES AND IN YOUNGSTERS' LIVES HAS A LIFELONG IMPACT. AND WE KIND OF. I THINK I KNOW THAT ON THE NATURALIST CALIFORNIANS AND CITIZENS BUT AS POLICY MAKERS I THINK IT'S. AND TEAR UP WITH US TO TO TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PRACTITIONERS RESEARCHERS. AND A LOOK AT REMEDIES HOW WE CAN LOOK AT THIS FROM THE EDUCATIONAL. BACKGROUND AS WELL AS THE HEALTH BACKGROUND TO HELP. FOCUS ON YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THESE YOUNGSTERS HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED BECAUSE THEIR SUCCESS IS OUR SUCCESS AND CONVERSELY. THEIR FAILURES ARE FAILURES WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AS WELL SO YOU KNOW HAVING A YOUNGSTER IN THE. JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. I KID YOU NOT. AN INVESTING IN EARLY EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE FOR ONE YOUNGSTER PER YEAR DIPPING ON PART DAY A FULL DAY'S. IT EITHER FIVE THOUSAND OR EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND SO. I THINK THIS IS WHAT. KINDA LANDS AND I'M LOOKING AT FROM THE EDUCATION PERSPECTIVE BUT ELSE ALSO KNOW THAT DEALS WITH. AB HEALTHCARE WORLD AS WELL SO LOOK FORWARD TO THE OF THE PANEL CONVERSATION TODAY. WITHOUT IF WE CAN HAVE OUR FIRST PANEL COME FORWARD DOCTOR HARRIS. DOCTOR THOMPSON AND DOCTOR HELFAND HOW LUCKY WE ARE TO HAVE SUCH A DISTINGUISHED PANEL BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO? INTRODUCE YOURSELVES WHEN YOU SPEAK AND HAVE WE CAN GO IN ORDER OF HOW WE WERE PRESENT. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO DOCTOR HARRIS. THANK YOU HAVE MY NAME IS NADINE BURKE HARRIS I'M A PEDIATRICIAN AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE CENTER FOR YOUTH WELLNESS IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND AT THE MISSION OF OUR ORGANIZATION IS TO AT IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. EXPOSED TO ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND OUR GOAL IS TO DO THAT BY IMPROVING TRANSLATING THE SCIENCE ABOUT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES INTO IMPROVEMENTS AND PRACTICE BY IN WHAT WE DO AS WELL AS RAISING AWARENESS FOR PREVENTION. I'M. GO AHEAD. BUDGET SHOULD WE DO THE ELECTIONS FIRST OR DO SHOULD BE TO CHECK JUST CHAMPION I THINK IF YOU CAN JUST JUMP IN AND THEN WE'LL DO AN INTRODUCTION BEFORE EACH PART I THAT'S ALRIGHT OKAY GREAT. SO I I'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED ABOUT. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT HOW ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AFFECT HEALTH AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. I'M THIS WORK STARTED FOR ME MORE THAN A DECADE AGO NOW. WHEN I OPENED A CLINIC AND ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S MOST UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT. OUT WHICH IS A NEIGHBORHOOD. WITH. HIGH NUMBERS OF. AT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IT'S ALSO ABOUT ONE OF THE LOWEST INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IS A PEDIATRICIAN WHAT I WAS OBSERVING WHAT'S THAT MANY CHILDREN WERE BEING REFERRED TO ME. FOR ADHD OR ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER. BUT WHEN I DID A THOROUGH HISTORY AND PHYSICAL WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT FOR MOST OF MY PATIENTS I COULDN'T MAKE A DIAGNOSIS OF STRAIGHTFORWARD ADHD. I AND THE REASON FOR THAT WAS BECAUSE MANY OF MY PATIENTS WERE BEING EXPOSED TWO VERY VERY HIGH DOSES OF. ADVERSITY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AT THE TIME IT WITH THE DSM FOUR. THEY SHOWED ALL OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT MY PATIENTS WERE HAPPENING BUT AT THE BOTTOM. IT SAID AND THESE SYMPTOMS ARE NOT CAUSED BY ANY OTHER MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER. NOW I'M NOT A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION I'M A PEDIATRICIAN BUT MY QUESTION WAS WHAT IF THIS IS BEING CAUSED BY SOME OTHER NEUROLOGIC PROCESS. THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY A MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER. AND AS I. MOVE FORWARD IN MY PRACTICE WHAT I NOTICED THAT IT IT WASN'T JUST CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR. IN ADDITION WHAT WE WERE SEEING UP WAS FOR EXAMPLE AS I WAS MANAGING A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL WITH ASTHMA AND I WAS GOING THROUGH HER ASTHMA TRIGGERS AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE DOING A GOOD JOB OF. NOT PREVENTING HER ASTHMA. I AS I ASKED HER MOM YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU NOTICE THAT TRIGGERS YOUR DAUGHTER'S ASTHMA BECAUSE WE HAD DONE KIND OF ALL OF THE STANDARD PRECAUTION. PRECAUTIONS SHE SAID TO ME. YOU KNOW LOOK TOWARD TOWN I NOTICED THAT MY DAUGHTER'S ASTHMA TENDS TO ACT UP EVERYTIME HER DAD PUNCHES A HOLE IN THE WALL. AND FOR ME THAT WAS REALLY WHAT GOT ME INTO LOOKING AT THE SCIENCE ABOUT HOW EARLY ADVERSITY. GETS UNDER OUR SKIN AND CHANGES OUR BIOLOGY AND THAT IS WHAT HAS LED ME TO THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES STUDY. AND SO. FOR FOLKS WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR OUTSIDE THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES STUDY WAS CONDUCTED NOW TWO DECADES AGO IT WAS PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND IT WAS A CONDUCTED IN PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THAT CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION THE CDC AND KAISER PERMANENTE A. AND IN IT THEY ASKED SEVENTEEN AND A HALF THOUSAND ADULTS ABOUT THEIR HISTORIES OF WHAT THEY CALLED ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND THESE INCLUDE PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL OR SEXUAL ABUSE PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL NEGLECT OR GROWING UP IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE PARENT WAS MENTALLY ILL SUBSTANCE THE PENDANT INCARCERATED WITH WITH PARENTAL SEPARATION OR DIVORCE. OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FOR EVERY YES AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD GET A POINT ON THEIR A SCORE FOR EACH ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES THAT THEY HAD EXPERIENCED. AND WHAT THEY FOUND IN THIS STUDY WAS REALLY GROUNDBREAKING AND THERE WERE TWO IMPORTANT THINGS. NUMBER ONE WAS THAT. ACES ARE INCREDIBLY COMMON AND THIS REALLY DEFY IT I THINK NOT PREVIOUS COMMON WITH THEM THAT. I CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY ONLY HAPPENS TO CERTAIN PEOPLE IN CERTAIN POPULATIONS. THIS STUDY WAS DONE IN A POPULATION THAT WAS SEVENTY PERCENT CAUCASIAN SEVENTY PERCENT COLLEGE EDUCATED TWO THIRDS OF THE STUDY PARTICIPANT HAD AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE. AND TWELVE POINT SIX PERCENT ONE IN EIGHT FOLKS HAD FOUR OR MORE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. IN CALIFORNIA OUR DATA SHOWS THAT EIGHTY SAYS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BY RACE OR ETHNICITY IS FOUND IN EVERY COMMUNITY AND EVERY POPULATION. AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ALMOST SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE FOUR OR MORE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. THE SECOND FINDING FROM THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES pWAS THIS VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP WHAT THEY. I'VE FOUND WITH A DOSE RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. SO FOR A PERSON WHO HAS FOUR OR MORE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. THEIR RISK FOR ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE THE NUMBER ONE KILLER IN THE UNITED STATES IS DOUBLE. AS COMPARED TO SOMEONE WITH AN A SCORE OF ZERO. HERE WE HAVE A LISTS OF THE TEN LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND HAVING AND A SCORE OF FOUR OR MORE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SO WHEN WE UNDERSTAND. THIS NUMBER ONE THAT A SAYS ARE INCREDIBLY COMMON A NUMBER TWO THERE'S A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SAYS. AN ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES THE NEXT UP IS UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS HAPPENS WHAT IS THE MECHANISM BECAUSE WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM WE CAN USE THAT SCIENCE FOR. TO TO DISRUPT THAT PROCESS. AND BIO WHEN THE ORIGINAL RESEARCHERS FIRST PUBLISHED THEIR DATA MANY FOLKS THOUGHT OF COURSE THIS MAKES SENSE. YOU HAVE A ROUGH CHILDHOOD YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO DRINK AND SMOKE AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO RUIN YOUR HEALTH. REALLY THIS IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT HEALTHCARE OR MEDICINE THIS IS REALLY ABOUT BEHAVIOR. BUT FORTUNATELY THERE SOME VERY RIGOROUS SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE DONE THE EVALUATION TO DEBUNK THAT MYTH WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT. PORTION OF THE RISK IS DUE TO HEALTH RISK BEHAVIOR. AND I'M GONNA PUT A LITTLE ASTERISK THERE BECAUSE I'M GONNA COME BACK TO IT. BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T ENGAGE IN ANY HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR EVEN IF YOU DON'T DRINK OR SMOKE YOU'RE NOT IN ACTIVE YOU DON'T EAT JUNK FOOD. YOU'RE STILL AT GREATER RISK FOR DEVELOPING HEART DISEASE COPD CANCER DIABETES THAT SARAH. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE. OF A MECHANISM THAT WE NOW KNOW. CALLED TOXIC. AND ESSENTIALLY IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO OUR BODY'S BIOLOGICAL FIGHTER FLIGHT RESPONSE. AND IT WORKS A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN A FOREST. AND YOU SEE THIS GUY RIGHT. WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR BRAINS AND BODIES ARE BRAIN SENDS A SIGNAL TO OUR BODIES TO RELEASE STRESS HORMONES? AND THE STRESS HORMONES PERFORM SOME VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THE INCREASE OUR BLOOD PRESSURE THEY INCREASE OUR BLOOD SUGAR. THEY. SPEED UP OUR HEART RATE THEY DILATE ARE PUPIL THINK OPEN UP OUR AIRWAYS SO THAT WE ARE READY TO EITHER FIGHT THAT BEAR. OR RUN FROM THE PAIR. AND THAT'S GOOD. BUT FOR MOST OF US IF WE WERE THINK TO THINK ABOUT FIGHTING A BEAR RIGHT IT WOULDN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD IDEA AND THAT IS WHY THE AMYGDALA THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT ACTIVATES THAT FEAR RESPONSE. SENSE PROJECTIONS TO THE PART OF OUR BRAIN THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING IMPULSE CONTROL. AND LEARNING THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND IT TURNS IT WAY DOWN RAIN BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IMPULSE CONTROL GETTING IN THE WAY OF SURVIVAL. AND THE FINAL THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE BODY WHEN OUR WHEN WE ACTIVATE OUR STRESS RESPONSE IS THAT IT ALSO ACTIVATES OUR IMMUNE RESPONSE. BECAUSE IF WE ARE IN A FOREST AND IF THERE IS A BEAR. IF THAT BEAR GETS ITS CLAWS INTO US WE WANT OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO BE PRIMED TO BRING INFLAMMATION TO STABILIZE THAT WOUND. SO THAT WE CAN EITHER. I. LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO TAG BEAT THAT THEY ARE OR GET AWAY. THIS SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED OVER. MILLENNIUM TO SAVE OUR LIVES FROM A MORTAL THREAT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT BEAR COMES HOME EVERY NIGHT. AND THIS BIOLOGICAL PROCESS. IS ACTIVATED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND IT GOES FROM BEING ADAPTIVE OR LIFESAVING. TO MALADAPTIVE OR HEALTH DAMAGING. AND WHEN CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO HIGH DOSES OF ADVERSITY. THE RESULT IS LONG TERM CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF CHILDREN'S BRAINS. OVER ACTIVITY OF THIS FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE AND DIFFICULTY TURNING THIS RESPONSE OFF. CHANGES TO AND I'LL COME BACK TO THE ASTROCYTE MENTIONED EARLIER. CHANGES TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BRAIN INCLUDING THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS. LEAD TO INCREASED RISK OF. DEPENDENCE OR. INCREASED RISK OF ENGAGING IN HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE PLEASURE AND REWARD CENTER OF THE BRAIN. WE ALSO SEE LONG TERM CHANGES TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. TO OUR HORMONAL SYSTEMS AND EVEN TO WEIGH EVEN TO THE WAY OUR DNA IS RED AND TRANSCRIBED AND THIS IS WHAT LEADS TO THE LIFELONG CHANGES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TOXIC. SO NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT EARLY LIFE ADVERSITY FILTERED THROUGH THE LENS OF BOTH PROTECTIVE FACTORS AS WELL AS PREDISPOSED VULNERABILITY. LEADS TO CHANGES WITH OUR IT IT TO A CHILD'S ENTIRE DEVELOPING BRAIN AND BODY. AND THIS IS WHAT LEADS TO THE LONG TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES WE CAN USE THE SCIENCE TO. CHANGE OUR PRACTICES FOR OUR CHILD. THE FIRST THING IS UNDERSTANDING THAT SIGNS OF TOXIC STRESS ARE DETECTABLE AS EARLY AS INFANCY. WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE. UP MOVES INTO THEIR FORTIES AND FIFTIES AND DEVELOP CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE OR CANCER OR CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE BEFORE WE CAN BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT. REMEDIES FOR THIS ISSUE WE CAN BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TOXIC STRESSED AS EARLY AS INFANCY BUT IN ORDER FOR US TO DO THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. TRAIN EVERY PROVIDER ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. SO WHEN WE FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF MY CLINICAL PRACTICE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE DID WAS WE WENT AND DID A CHART REVIEW OF ALL OF OUR PATIENTS TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT WERE THEIR A SCORES LIKE THE WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT VERY SIMILAR TO THE KAISER STUDY TWO THIRDS OF OUR PATIENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE? AND ONE IT AND TWELVE PERCENT HAD EXPERIENCE FOR ARM OR MORE. NOW THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR POPULATION WITH THAT RATHER THAN IT BEING AN ADULT POPULATION WHICH WAS BEING ASKED WHICH OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD. THE MEDIAN AGE OF OUR PATIENTS WITH EIGHT YEARS OLD. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT FOR OUR PATIENTS WHO HAD FOUR OR MORE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. THEY WERE TWICE AS LIKELYTO BE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. AND THIRTY TWO POINT SIX TIMES AS LIKELY. TO HAVE LEARNING OR BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN SCHOOL. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR DATA. FOR OUR KIDS WITH ZERO A SAYS ONLY THREE PERCENT OF THEM HAD LEARNING AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS AND KIDS A IN SCHOOL. AND FOR OUR KIDS WITH FOUR OR MORE ACES FIFTY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT MORE THAN HALF OF THEM HAD LEARNING AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS. THIS HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR EVERY PROVIDER ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO IS CURRENTLY. UP TREATING KIDS WHO ARE BEING PRESENTED TO THAT WITH BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. RIGHT NOW MOST OF THESE CHILDREN ARE BEING MISDIAGNOSED AS HAVING ADHD WITHOUT THE ROOT CAUSE OF EARLY ADVERSITY BEING RECOGNIZED. AND THE MOST COMMON TREATMENT FOR FOR ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER. IF STIMULANTS. RIGHT SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE BETTER QUALITY OF CARE MORE APPROPRIATE CARE TO OUR KIDS. AND RIGHT NOW TEACHERS ACROSS OUR STATE ARE BEING ASKED TO EDUCATE KIDS WHO ARE BEING EXPOSED TO A NEUROTOXIN AND IT'S SIMPLY UNFAIR WE WOULD NOT. WE CANNOT ASK TEACHERS TO BE DOCTORS TO CURE TOXIC STRESS WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE OUR EDUCATORS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TO OUR. WORK WITH KIDS WHO ARE GETTING THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT FOR TOXIC STRESS WHICH IS TO REDUCE THEIR DOSE OF ADVERSITY AND ENHANCE THE BUFFERING CAPACITY OF THE CAREGIVERS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT. SO WHAT WE KNOW NOW. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT WE LOOK AT HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WE CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES WITH ROUTINE SCREENING EARLY DETECTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. I AT THIS OUR MY ORGANIZATION THE CENTER FOR YOUTH WELL LET'S HAS WORKED WITH PROVIDERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO BEING ABLE TO SCREEN FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AS PART OF PRIMARY CARE. AND ARE ONE TWO AND THREE BARRIERS ARE TIME. FOLKS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY HAVE A POSITIVE SCREEN AND THEY DON'T GET REIMBURSED FOR. BUT WE HAVE A SCREENING TOOL TO BE ABLE TO SCREEN QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY. FOR RISK FACTORS OF TOXIC STRESS IN PRIMARY CARE THAT CAN BE DONE IN THREE MINUTES OR LESS WE TWENTY ENHANCE OUR PROTECTIVE FACTORS AND THEN WE NEED TO DO THIS INTERVENTION. BOTH IN THE CLINICAL SETTING AND IN THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO YOUR BRIEF EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BEFORE WE WRAP UP. SO IN OUR CLINICAL SETTING UP FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS THE GROWTH CHART OF A PATIENT THAT I CARED FOR. WHO WITH EXPERIENCING FAILURE TO THRIVE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE LITTLE DOTS AS THEY FALL BELOW THAT THE LIGHT PART OF THE GRAPH THIS IS A CHILD WHO LITERALLY? HAD GROWTH IMPAIRMENT SHE WAS NOT GAINING WEIGHT OR HEIGHT. AND. ABOUT THIS IS A CHILD WHO HAD ACTUALLY BEEN THIS THIS GROWTH CHART IT'S FROM HER PREVIOUS PEDIATRICIAN. THIS YOUNG UP GIRL CAME TO SEE ME AFTER HER PARA ACT HER FAMILY MOVED TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND AS PART OF HER REGULAR TREATMENT WE ACTUALLY SCREEN HER FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. HER A SCORE FOR THIS. ALMOST THREE YEAR OLD CHILD WITH A SEVEN SHE HAD EXPERIENCED SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF THE ACES THAT I TALKED ABOUT. BUT WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND IN OUR CASE WE HAD INTEGRATED PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THIS CHILD WHO HAD BEEN TREATED WITH ONLY WITH NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR FAILURE TO THRIVE WHO HADN'T BEEN GROWING. FOR OVER A YEAR. WHEN WE DID. ACES INFORMS TREATMENT. WITHIN SIX MONTHS SHE WAS BACK ON THE GROWTH CHARTS. IN ADDITION IN THE COMMUNITY WHAT WE SEE IS THAT. MORE AND MORE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT INTERVENTION THAT IS ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE STRESS RESPONSE ENHANCE BUFFERING CAPACITIES AND AT WITH INTERVENTIONS LIKE SLEEP. EXERCISE NUTRITION MINDFULNESS MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP. AND AS AN EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT JOHN O'CONNELL HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN ALSO A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IMPLEMENTED A MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION WITH THE GOAL OF CALMING THIS OVER ACTIVE STRESS RESPONSE. AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS A REDUCTION IN SCHOOL VIOLENCE. A SUBSTANTIAL DROP IN THE SUSPENSION RATE. AN INCREASE IN GPA. AN INCREASE AND COMPOSITE STAR TEST SCORES. AND MY FAVORITE DECREASE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AMONG ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS OVER THE COURSE OF THE INTERVENTION. HAVING A TRAUMA INFORMED FRAMEWORK KNOWING WHAT WE ARE TREATING KNOWING THAT WE CAN. WITH ROUTINE SCREENING EARLY DETECTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY FOR. MILLIONS OF OUR CHILDREN. IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL POWERFUL WAY FOR US TO USE THE SCIENCE TO IMPROVE HEALTH. AND LIFE OUTCOMES CHILDREN ACROSS OUR STATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU DOCTOR HERS. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DOCTOR THOMPSON AND. I THINK HE'LL UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY OF US ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS BODY OF WORK AND THE PASSION IN WHICH YOU BRING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER. IT'S IMPORTANT THE. I'M REMEMBERING YOUR STORIES OF BAYVIEW THAT COME THROUGH YOUR BOOK AND REMIND MYSELF OF MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT MANY OF US COME FROM AS WELL. AND REALLY I'M HONORED THAT. YOU'RE HERE TODAY TO BRING YOUR TESTIMONY AND. SO WITH THAT DOCTOR THOMPSON. WELL AYE ROSS THOMPSON AND DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS WHICH IS WHERE I STUDY YOUNG CHILDREN AND THIS EVENING I WILL BE MORE DISTINGUISHED AMONG MY FAMILY WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT I JUST FOLLOWED NAY DEEMED BURKE HARRIS. I'M I ALSO SERVE ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF OUR UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR PULP FOR POVERTY RESEARCH. AND THEN THE OTHER HAT THAT I WEAR IS I'M CURRENTLY PRESIDENT OF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ZERO TWO THREE. WHICH IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT DEVOTED TO THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. I I WILL NOT HAVE POWER POINT SLIDES IN ORDER TO AVERT THE WORST TENDENCIES OF AN ACADEMIC. BUT I WILL SAY THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR THAT I THINK YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF ARTICLES THAT I HAD SENT ON FRIDAY. RELATING TO CHILDREN IN STRESS AND SOME OF THE PUBLIC POLICY AVENUES THAT CAN HELP TO ADDRESS THAT CHALLENGE AND. AND SO THAT IS THE SUBSTITUTE FOR FOR POWER POINTS PERHAPS. THE RESEARCH PRESENTED BY A BY DOCTOR HARRIS CONCERNING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OF THEIR LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. IT DRAWS OUR ATTENTION AGAIN TO THE WAYS IN WHICH EARLY EXPERIENCE COULD HAVE A PROFOUND LEGACY FOR LIFELONG DEVELOPMENT. AND IT COINCIDES WITH RESEARCH SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH THAT FOLLOWS CHILDREN FROM VERY EARLY IN LIFE. I ANY EXPERIENCES THEY HAVE AND LOOKS AT WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM OUTCOMES FOLLOWING FROM THOSE EXPERIENCES. AS ONE OF STUDY SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF VERY YOUNG CHILDREN BEGINNING AS EARLY A SIX MONTHS OF AGE AND WORKS TO PROMOTE YOUNG CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF LIFE. I THINK THERE ARE THREE MESSAGES FROM CURRENT RESEARCH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO DOCTOR HARRIS'S COMMENTS. AND THE FIRST OF THEM IS ONE THAT YOU ALLUDED TO BRIEFLY THAT I THINK WE NEED TO DEEPEN A LITTLE BIT ON. WHICH IS THAT RESEARCH UP EARLY DEVELOPMENT IS SHOWING THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS IT IF YOUNGER AND YOUNGER AGES. BOB I'VE LITERALLY BEEN IN THE POSITION OF WATCHING HOW PSALM THE THE THRESHOLD FOR THE ON. OF OUR ABILITY TO DETECT SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF CHRONIC STRESS IS MOVING IT EARLIER AND EARLIER AGES. THERE NOW NEW STUDIES USING NEURO IMAGING METHODS AND CORTISOL ATTACHES ALSACE SHOWING HOW THE BIOLOGICALLY DISRUPTIVE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS CAN BE SEEN AS EARLY AS THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE. NOT JUST INFANCY. THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE. WITH AFFECTS BOTH ON BRAIN FUNCTIONING. BUT ALSO AND BRAIN STRUCTURE. THAT WE CAN OBSERVE THROUGH IMAGING STUDIES SIMPLY PUT. JUST AS WE HAVE LONG KNOWN THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT SHAPED BY EARLY EXPERIENCE WE ARE NOW SEEING THE PROFOUND EFFECTS OF EARLY STRESS ON HOW THE BRAIN DEVELOPS AND FUNCTIONS. AS EARLY AS THE FIRST YEAR. EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY I THINK. OF CONCERN TO TO THOSE OF US WHO STUDY YOUNG CHILDREN IS THAT THESE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS. HAVE BEEN LINKED TO HOW TO TO DIFFERENCES IN HOW CHILDREN LEARN AND HOW THEY DEVELOP. ONE STUDY SHOWED FOR EXAMPLE THE BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN STRUCTURE EMERGING DURING THE EARLY YEARS. HELP TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LOWER ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES IN PRESCHOOL CHILDREN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC STRESS COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS. THERE'S ALSO GROWING EVIDENCE A CHRONIC STRESS CAN HELP EVEN EARLIER AFFECTS. IN EFFECT. BEFORE CHILDREN ARE BORN. STUDIES OF INFANTS BORN TO MOTHERS WHO EXPERIENCED PERSON STRESS DURING THEIR PREGNANCIES REVEAL THAT IS NEW PARTS THESE CHILDREN ARE THEMSELVES MORE EMOTIONALLY REACTIVE INSENSITIVE TO STRESS. WITH FOLLOW UP STUDIES SHOWING THAT THERE ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS IN CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE. THE PRENATAL AFFECTS A MATERNAL STRESS ON THE DEVELOPING FETUS. WHAT HAS COME TO BE KNOWN IN THE FIELD AS FETAL PROGRAMMING? IT'S ANOTHER INDICATION OF HOW MUCH THE CHILD'S RAPIDLY DEVELOPING BIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE. T. INFLUENCES SUCH AS STRESSORS EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT EVEN BEFORE A CHILD IS BORN. SO THE ASUS STUDY IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RESEARCH SHOWING HOW THE STRESSES OF ALL KINDS CAN HAVE EARLY IN AND DURING THE IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT. WITH GREATER AFFECTS THE YOUNGER THE CHILD. BUT I NEED TO SAY THAT THERE'S A SILVER LINING TO THIS DARK CLOUD OF EARLY VULNERABILITY. BECAUSE THE SAME BIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE SO VULNERABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF EARLY STRESS. ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF REMEDIATION IF THE SOURCES OF STRESS ARE IDENTIFIED INDUSTRY THE EDITOR AND ADDRESS. THROUGH EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT THE BRAINS MALLEABILITY OR PLASTICITY IS WE CALL. COMPARE ALLY IN HELPING TO SHIFT THE ODDS TOWARD MORE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. I'LL BE TURNING TO THAT LITTLE BIT LATER. IDENTIFYING SOURCES OF EARLY STRESS REALLY LEADS TO MY SECOND CONCLUSION AND IT IS THIS. THERE ARE MORE SOURCES OF TOXIC STRESS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN THEN FOR OLDER CHILDREN AND ADULTS. AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE TERM TOXIC STRESSING AND WHERE CAN COME FROM FOR CHILDREN WE NATURALLY THINK OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT HARM OR THREATEN. OR TERRORIZE I TRAUMATIZE THEM. THESE ARE THE STRESSES THAT ATTRACTED THE ASUS STUDIES SUCH AS PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL OR SEXUAL ABUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE HOME. PARENTS SEPARATION OR DIVORCE OR EMOTIONAL OR PHYSICAL NEGLECT. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR RECOGNIZE THAT THE STRESS IS LIKE THESE ARE MORE PREVALENT AMONG THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN THAN FOR ANY OLDER AGE GROUP. TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR EXAMPLE NEARLY ONE QUARTER OF CHILDREN AGED THREE AND UNDER LIVED IN POVERTY. AND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THREE PERCENT LIVED IN POOR FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS. THESE PROPORTIONS ARE HIGHER FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH MEANS HAD MORE THAN HALF OF CHILDREN AGED THREE AND BELOW LIVE IN FAMILIES AND ECONOMIC DIFFICULTY IN OUR STATE NOW. THE REASON I MENTION POVERTY. IS THAT FOR THOSE OF US WHO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS ON YOUNG CHILDREN POVERTY BECOMES THE EGO TO TEST CASE. BECAUSE A COMBINED SO MANY SOURCES OF STRESS ALL IN ONE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. IT MEANS THAT YOU NOT ONLY ARE IN A SITUATION OF ON FOOD INSECURITY AND HOUSING INSTABILITY YOUR PARENTS WERE THEMSELVES STRESSED. AND MAY HAVE OTHER DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. SO POVERTY IS A SOURCE OF TOXIC STRESS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND THE YOUNGER THE CHILD THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO BE LIVING IN A LOWER INCOME SETTING. BUT IT'S NOT JUST POVERTY MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THE VICTIMS OF SUBSTANTIATED CHILD MALTREATMENT TWENTY FIFTEEN WERE CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF THREE. AND VICTIMIZATION RATE WAS HIGHER FOR INFANTS UNDER ONE YEAR OF AGE. SO SAY IT AGAIN THE YOUNGER YOU ARE THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO BE LIVING IN CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TOXIC STRESS. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS A VIEWS EXPERIENCES ONLY CAPTURE PART OF THE NATURE OF TOXIC STRESS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. BECAUSE THEY DEPEND SO SIGNIFICANTLY ON ADULTS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AND SUPPORTIVE CARE. EXPERIENCES CAN ALSO BE TOXIC TO YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN THEY INVOLVE A DEPRIVATION OR WITHDRAWAL OF THAT. CARE. THIS IS WHY CHILD EMOTIONAL NEGLECT IS INCLUDED AMONG THE ACES AS WELL AS PARENT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE DEPRESSION. AND HERE AGAIN THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE. MOTHERS HAVE MORE THAN ONE IN SEVEN INFANTS WILL EXPERIENCE MAJOR DEPRESSION IN THEIR CHILD'S FIRST YEAR AND THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DIRECTLY TIED TO CHANGES IN THE BABY'S DEVELOPING BRAIN. THAT'S WHEN WE THINK OF TOXIC STRESS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WE HAVE TO CONSIDER A BROADER RANGE OF EXPERIENCES THAN WE ORDINARILY CONSIDER FOR AN OLDER CHILD OR AN ADULT. CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF THREE OR FOUR HAVING TO FACE STRESSFUL SPIRIT EXPERIENCES ALONE WITHOUT SUPPORT IS TOXIC. BEEN DEPRIVED OF NURTURING SUPPORTIVE CARE IT'S TOXIC. MY LAST CONCLUSION FROM CURRENT RESEARCH ADDRESSES INTERVENTION. THE EFFECTS OF EARLY STRESSES ARE BEST ADDRESSED. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SERVICES THAT BEGIN WITH EARLY IDENTIFICATION BUT WHICH CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE CHILDREN AND THOSE WHO CARE FOR THEM AS THE CHILD DEVELOPS. BOB PERHAPS THE BEST WAY OF EXPRESSING THIS IS TO STATE WHAT I'M SAYING IN THE NEGATIVE. EARLY IDENTIFICATION IS IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL BUT WE CANNOT STOP THEIR. WE ALSO NEED TO INTERVENE EFFECTIVELY TO ADDRESS THE SOURCES OF STRESS. AN INTERVENTION FOCUS OF THE DEVELOPING CHILD IS IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL BUT WE CANNOT STOP THEIR. WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE CHILD'S CAREGIVERS ON HOME THE CHILD DEPENDS FOR NURTURANCE AND PROTECTION TO HELP THEM BE SOURCES OF RELIABLE SUPPORT IF WE CAN'T. FINALLY INTERVENING EARLY IS IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL BUT WE CAN'T STOP THERE. WE NEED A SYSTEM OF CONTINUING SUPPORT TO PROVIDE SEAMLESS AND ONGOING ASSISTANCE AS THE CHILDREN ARE HEALING. NOW WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED YOUR SOME OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF INFINITE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH. YES THERE IS A FIELD INFANT MENTAL HEALTH. AND IT DOES NOT CONSIST OF BABIES LYING ON A COUCH RELATING THEIR PROBLEMS TO A PSYCHIATRIST TO SCRIBBLING NOTES NEARBY. INSTEAD IT IS BASED ON THE REALIZATION THAT THERE ARE MANY SOURCES OF TOXIC STRESS IN THE LIVES OF CHILDREN AGED THREE AND UNDER. AND THAT THE STRESSES EXIST EXACT A COST ON THEIR EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AS WELL AS IN THEIR LEARNING AND THINKING SKILLS. TREATING THESE PROBLEMS REQUIRES NOT PSYCHOLOGIST IN CULTURES BUT RATHER SKILLED EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONER. WORKING CLOSELY WITH A CHILD AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT TREATMENT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN IS A TO GENERATIONAL APPROACH. BECAUSE YOUNG CHILDREN DEPEND SO MUCH ON THE PROTECTION IN SUPPORT OF THEIR CAREGIVERS THE GOAL OF INTERVENTION IS TO STRENGTHEN THE CHILD'S CAPACITIES FOR LEARNING IN RELATING TO OTHERS. BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF CARE. THE CHILD CAN DEPEND ON. IT A POLICY BRIEF COMMISSION BY THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION IT WILL BE RELEASED EARLY NEXT WEEK. I REVIEWED THE VARIETY OF EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS WILL BE THAT THAT THAT EXISTS TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. INCLUDING THOSE FOCUSED ON EVERYTHING FROM BUILDING PARENTING SKILLS AND RESPONSIVENESS TO THE CHILD. TWO INITIATIVES A COMBINED HOME VISITATION WITH PARENT EDUCATION ASSISTANCE WITH HEALTHCARE AND OTHER SERVICES BASED ON THE FAMILY'S NEEDS. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IMPROVING YOUNG CHILDREN'S EMOTIONAL WELL BEING SELF REGULATION AND LATER SCHOOL READINESS BEGINNING EARLY IN LIFE. NOT ALL EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSED ON THE CHILD OF THE PARENT HOWEVER. THERE ARE ALSO EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION PROGRAMS DEVOTED TO HELPING TEACHERS IN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNS OF EARLY STRESS AND TRAUMA IN THE YOUNG CHILDREN THEY CARE FOR. AND TO KNOW THE STRATEGIES FOR RESPONDING THESE CHILDREN IN WAYS THAT CAN REALLY HELP THEM OF THE KIND OF DOCTOR HARRIS SPOKE TO. IN A MATTER PARALLELING THE GROWTH OF TRAINING IN TRAUMA INFORMED TEACH. THAT IS OCCURRING IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS ARE BEING ASSISTED IN LEARNING SKILLS OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. AND THEIR MOTIVATION IS BASED ON WHAT I HEAR FROM THESE TEACHERS IN MY WORK WITH THEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY ARE SAYING FAR MORE YOUNG CHILDREN SHOWING SIGNS OF TOXIC STRESSED NOW THAN IT EVER SEEN IN THE PAST. AND IT SEEMS RELATED TO THE FAMILY STRESSES. IN THE FAMILIES OF THESE CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN ASSOCIATED WITH POVERTY FOOD INSECURITY AND HOUSING PROBLEMS THAT THEY ALL HAVE TO COPE WITH. AND THOSE WHO WORK WITH EVEN THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN INFANTS AND TODDLERS ARE REPORTED THAT THE SIGNS OF STRESS. OUR ALSO HIGHER THAN THEY'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. NOW OWING TO THE STATE'S INVESTMENT OF THE PAST IN THE WORK OF FIRST FIVE AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THERE EXISTS A HOME VISITATION. AND PARENTING SKILLS TRAININGS PROGRAMS AN EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVES IN SOME COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE DOES NOT EXIST HOWEVER SYSTEM THAT INTEGRATE C. SERVICES SEAMLESSLY. TO ENSURE THAT YOUNG CHILDREN WHO ARE BEGINNING TO COUNT UP THE NUMBER OF ACES IN THEIR YOUNG LIVES RECEIVE THE CONTINUING SUPPORT THEY NEED TO PUT THEIR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. OUGHT A POSITIVE TRAJECTORY. PERSONALLY DOES NOT EXIST SUCH AS SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE AN IMPORTANT SERVICES REMAIN LACKING IN THE COUNTIES OF GREATEST NEED. DEVELOPING SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE SEVERAL THINGS INCLUDING STRENGTHENING AVENUES OF EARLY IDENTIFICATION SUCH AS IN PEDIATRIC PRACTICE THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS HEALTHY STEPS. AND ENSURING THAT REFERRAL RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE CHILDREN IN CARE GIVERS WHO NEED THEM. IT WOULD INVOLVE USING OF HEALTH CARE NETWORK. PARTICULARLY WORKING ON THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES CAN RECEIVE THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN. IT CAN ALSO INVOLVE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO CREATE AVENUES FOR THE INTEGRATION OF COORDINATION OF SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THE GREATEST NEED OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IT WOULD ALSO INVOLVE STRENGTHENING THE STATE SYSTEM OF EARLY CHILDCARE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THE TEACHERS ARE WELL EQUIPPED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES. TRAUB INFORMED CARE IT WOULD INVOLVE MUCH MORE. WHAT IS HISTORICALLY NOVEL ABOUT THE CURRENT MOMENT? IT'S NOT JUST THE WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION. ABOUT THE CHALLENGES TO CHILDREN ARISING FROM EARLY STRESS. BUT WE HAVE MORE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. AND WE HAVE MORE EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY OF STATE BASED BAND LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY PROVING EFFECTIVE IN ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES WE HAVE MORE TOOLS TO WORK WITH. TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM THAT WE UNDERSTAND BETTER. SO CREATING THAT SYSTEM IS A CHALLENGING BEFORE CHALLENGE BEFORE US RECOGNIZING THAT BY MAKING THESE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS IN PREVENTIVE AND REMEDIAL SERVICES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WHERE TO BETTER POSITION TO ENSURE THAT THESE CHILDREN GET A HEALTHY START IN LIFE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. THANK YOU DOCTOR THOMPSON. NEXT. DOCTORAL. HIGH I'M. NEIL HEALTH AND I'M A PEDIATRICIAN ALSO AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS IN. MEDICAL SCHOOL AT UCLA PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROFESSOR OF. PUBLIC POLICY AND I RUN SOMETHING CALLED THE CENTER FOR HEALTHIER CHILDREN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. AND I STARTED MY CAREER THIRTY SOMETHING YEARS AGO OF. ON A VERY SIMILAR PATH TO NADINE I READ SOMETHING CALLED THE CENTER FOR THE BOND WILL CHILD AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAKLAND ALL WE DID WAS TAKE CARE OF KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN ABUSED AND NEGLECTED. AND SAW LOTS OF THOSE GROWTH TRAJECTORIES WERE KIDS WERE IN THE ROTH GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND WE GOT VERY GOOD AT PUTTING TOGETHER SERVICES FOR THEM BUT THAT AT SOME POINT I REALIZED. ARE THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH PEDIATRICIANS AND ENOUGH SERVICES THAT I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE UPSTREAM AND FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE STOP THOSE YOU KNOW. AND THAT TOO IS TREATED. AND SO WHAT I THINK NEEDING TO STAND AS MADE A PALLET FOR ARGUMENT FOR WHY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO DO SOMETHING DRAMATIC AND TRANSFORMATIVE. AND ROSS LAID OUT A LOT OF WHAT WE CAN BE DOING AS AS MADE THE AND I'M I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO THAT. AND WHAT THE POLICY IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE OF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. WE WERE WE EVER REACH TREATING CALIFORNIA DREAM I THINK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE GROWING ADVERSITY BECAUSE OUR HUMAN ACCO SYSTEM IS RADICALLY CHANGING RIGHT NOW VERY QUICKLY. AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR POOR KIDS BUT IT'S FOR ALL CHILDREN WHICH SEEMED DISTRICT AND DEEP CHANGES ARE DISRUPTING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCAFFOLDING THE KIDS NEED TO FLOURISH AND THRIVE. IN KIDS ARE KIND OF THE. CANARIES IN THE CHANGING GLOBAL COAL MINE THAT'S GOING ON. WE HAVE SYMPTOMATIC PIECEMEAL SOLUTIONS THAT ARE COSTLY INEFFECTIVE DISHEARTENING AND OFTEN SELF DEFEATING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER. WE NEED A SYSTEMS APPROACH WORKING AT SCALE MEANING THAT WE DID NOT BE DOING DEMOS BUT WORKING AT SCALE IS IN A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY WITH THE PURPOSE OF A SOCIAL MOVEMENT. AND WHAT YOU HEARD FROM NADINE IS A PASS ON THAT SUCH A SOCIAL MOVEMENT THAT WHAT WHAT PURPOSE WOULD BRING. A SOLUTION I BELIEVE AS WE NEED A UNIVERSAL STRATEGY FOCUSING ON ALL CHILDREN THRIVING AND ALL FAMILIES FLOURISH. WE NEED UNIVERSAL FAMILY SUPPORTS BECAUSE THE FAMILIES OF THE ONES THAT ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. AS WELL AS HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION THOSE HAVE TO BE UNIVERSAL FOR ALL KIDS WE NEED POPULATION LEVEL DATA AN IMPROVEMENT MANY OTHER COUNTRIES MANY OTHER PLACES HAVE THAT DATA WE DON'T. IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN RUNNING FIRST FIVE MALE FOR ALL CLOSE TO TWENTY YEARS AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE DATA TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S WORKING AT ALL. SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE HAVE NO MEASURES ON THE OUTCOMES FOR THE STATE. WE HAVE BEEN OVER AND WE NEED INNOVATIVE FINANCING THAT INCENTIVIZE AS IMMIGRATION ACROSS SECTORS IN SILOS AND THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO USE THIS CHANGE FROM VOLUME TO VALUE FINANCING THEM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS A FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS THAT'S GOING TO BE SPENT ON TWENTY TWENTY. ON HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA FOUR HUNDRED BILLION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MUCH OF WHICH IS WASTE OF BUT THAT COULD BE SHIFTED UPSTREAM TO KIDS. UP IN IN TERMS OF THAT VALUE. AND FOCUS ON CITIES AS UNITS OF INNOVATION IN ACTION AND TRANSFORMATION. ARE THEY CREATING A LEARNING PLATFORM FOR RAPID CYCLE INNOVATION COMMUNICATION MANDATE AT THIS IS MY SORT OF PRESCRIPTION THAT I THINK FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT. IF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL LICENSE WOULD BE DROPPING DOWN PRESIDENT ITALY LOW LEVELS WE'D HAVE LESS NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH JUNE WOMAN JUST SO SPECIAL EDUCATION SCHOOLS WOULD BE LESS BURDEN WITH MORE WITH THE KIDS THAT WERE TROUBLE. WE'D HAVE A DECREASE PREVALENCE OF THESE PREVENTABLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS THAT NEED IN I THINK WE COULD ACTUALLY DROP OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS BY ABOUT A THIRD. IF WE WERE ACTUALLY TO TAKE THIS HAT ON A MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT. WE HAVE MORE STABLE HAPPIER FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES MORE FUNDS TO SPEND ON OTHER STATE PRIORITIES AND WE WOULD ACHIEVE THE HUMAN CAPITAL REVOLUTION THAT OUR STATE NEEDS TO FLOURISH IN THE FUTURE. AND I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL HERE IS WERE HOW DO WE MOVE TO THIS NEW KIND OF FUTURE BY TAKING CARE OF THIS REALLY. INSIDIOUS PROBLEM. SO WE KNOW A LOT WOOD THAT'S ALREADY BEEN TALKED ABOUT HOW ADVERSITY TO. REALLY. DAMAGES HUMAN POTENTIAL WE HAVE MORE ADVERSITY THAT AN INCREASING AND WHAT I WANT TO MAKE A POINT OF IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST TEMPORE KIDS OR IN LOW INCOME KIDS IT'S RISING RIDE UP. THE OF THE. INCOME SPECTRUM. IN IT WITH STUDY THAT WE RECENTLY SHOWED THAT UP TO FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE POVERTY% LEVEL YOU HAVE VERY VERY HIGH LEVELS OF BASIS IN THE. IN THE POPULATION AND PART OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THOUGHT WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR SOCIETY RIGHT NOW. THE TRADITIONAL CAUSES OF BASES ARE POVERTY SOCIAL EXCLUSION RACISM FAMILY DYSFUNCTION ON TREATED ON CONTROL MENTAL HEALTH. DRUG. AN ALCOHOL PROBLEMS ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE KNOW THAT WOULD SEEM AT FACE VALUE OF THESE THINGS ARE BAD FOR YOU SAID. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARTHY RIGHT OFF THE BAT YOU DON'T NEED A ROCKET SCIENTIST STONE NO THAT'S THESE THINGS ARE GOOD FOR KIDS AND OTHER LIVING THINGS RIGHT WE KNOW THAT. BUT WE HAVE THESE NEWER DEEPER DRIVERS OF WHAT'S CAUSING ADVERSELY WE'RE MAKING A CHANGE OF AGE TO FROM A. FROM AN INDUSTRIAL AGE TO AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGE THAT IS CHANGING EVERYTHING ON OUR SOCIETY OF PRISA. WE'RE SEEING MAJOR DE OUT THE. DISRUPTIONS AND ALL OUR BAR SOCIAL WACKO SYSTEMS CULTURAL CHANGES VALUES STREAMS PRODUCTION MODELS WORK MODELS ARE ALL CHANGING RIGHT NOW FOR EVERYONE. AND WE'RE SEEING THE ACCELERATORS OF THAT CHANGE BEING GLOBALIZATION TECHNOLOGY CLIMATE CHANGE URBANIZATION INEQUALITY MASS MIGRATION THIS IS OFF THAT'S A PERFECT STORM OF MAJOR TSUNAMIS THAT ARE HITTING OUR SOCIETY AND OUR FUTURE AT PRESENT. AND THIS UNDER COURAGE THAT WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE SPEED OF CHANGE IS ACCELERATING FASTER THAN WE CAN ADAPT TO AT PRESENT. AND SO WE'RE SEEING THIS MISMATCH BETWEEN WHAT WE WERE PROGRAMMED OUR ANCESTRAL BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY IN WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO ADAPT TO. AT PRESENT. AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING THE SUICIDE RATES IN KIDS IN PLACES LIKE PALO ALTO WHERE THEY'RE THROWING THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF TRAINS IT'S NOT POOR KIDS THAT ARE DOING THAT. THESE ARE KIDS THAT ARE IN HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES THAT ARE IN MENTAL DISTRESS. A PART OF THIS THIS COMES FROM TOM FRIEDMAN'S BOOK WORRY SO SHOWS ARE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IN HUMAN ADAPTABILITY AND WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY IN DIGITALIZATION STUFF THAT FAR EXCEED WHERE WE'RE AT AT PRESIDENT. AND LOTS OF POOR PEOPLE NOT EDUCATED AREN'T UP THERE ON THE ADAPTABILITY SIDE OF THIS THING AND THIS IS GONNA JUST GET MORE. AND THE THE REASON I'M MAKING THIS POINT AS THE TSUNAMIS HAVE CHANGE THAT ARE COMING IN AT A. AND OCT CHANGING OUR WORKPLACES INCREASING THE WHAT MAN OF ALL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE THE NATURE OF WORK AND IN CALIFORNIA THE STUFF IS GONNA JUST KEEP COMING. AND IT'S GONNA MAKE PEOPLE THAT ARE MARGINALIZED ALREADY AND POOR AND ISOLATED EVEN MORE MARGINALIZED POOR AND ISOLATED. SO WE HAVE THIS GROWING DEBILITATING COMPLEX PROBLEM WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENTIAL LIFELONG A FAX THERE'S NO SINGLE CAUSE AND NO MAGIC BULLET. WE KNOW IT'S AFFECTING LOTSA KIDS AND WHAT WERE SEEN RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FORTY PERCENT OF CHILDREN THAT HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. OKAY WHEN I STARTED AS A PEDIATRICIAN TWENTY BOATS TWENTY FOUR CLOSE TO THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THAT WAS AROUND FIFTEEN PERCENT. OKAY. WE HAVE A GROWING PREVALENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS TWENTY POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF KIDS ADOLESCENTS HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS WITH IMPAIRMENTS OF PRESS. AND WE HAVE A GREATER APPRECIATION OF THESE NARROW DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS AND LOTS OF KIDS WITH MULTIPLE PROBLEMS THESE ARE CALLED SIN DEL MIX. THESE ARE WHEN IT EPIDEMIC SOURCE ENERGIZING TOGETHER AND THEY'RE REFINING THE ROOTS BACK TO THE SUPER EARLY ADVERSITY THAT THEY'RE ALL FINDING THEIR WAY BACK TO. AND SO WE'RE SEEING THE PRUSSIAN RATES THAT ARE JUST SKYROCKETING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THIS THING'S JUST CASCADE THEM NADINE WAS SHOWING THIS HOW THAT'S JUST CASCADES THROUGH THE LIFESPAN. AND ENDS UP HAVING AN ENORMOUS BECAUSE OF FOR OUR SOCIETY. WE HAVE THE SCIENCE AND THE EVIDENCE IN THE PROGRAMS AS ROSS WAS TALKING ABOUT NAY DEAN WAS TALKING ABOUT BAR CURRENT APPROACHES PIECEMEAL FRAGMENTED. WE HAVE NO COMMON METRICS GOALS AND STANDARDS AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS HERE. WE'VE MADE LOTS OF POLICIES THAT ACTUALLY. THINGS SEPARATE AND FUN THING SEPARATELY BUT DON'T ALLOW US TO PUT RATIONAL SYSTEMS TOGETHER. AND WE NEED A LONG TERM IN THE GREAT A POLICY IN LEARNING STRATEGY THIS HAS TO BE THIS IS LIKE FOR FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS LIKE PUTTING A WHOLE NEW WATER SYSTEM A WHOLE NEW TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE NEED A FIFTEEN YEAR PLAN FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM FOR THE CAT STATE A CALIFORNIA THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. IF WE KEEP THROWING MORE MODEL PROGRAMS A LITTLE BIT HERE AND THERE WERE GOING TO END UP WITH FIVE PERCENT OF KIDS GET THIS IN FIVE PERCENT WHO NEED TO GET THAT. AND WE'VE STILL WON'T BE MAKING THE KIND OF PROGRESS. THE WAY THAT WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE THIS VERY SIMPLE TO COMMUNITIES ONE WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM AS WE SHOW THESE DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES KITS CAN GO INTO A DILLON LATER DISORDER TRAJECTORY OR AT RISK TRAJECTORY. ME UP PROBABLY TEN FIFTEEN PERCENT BELOW US PROBABLY ANOTHER THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT. AND THE MORE ADVERSITY YOU HAVE THEM WHAT LORD YOU GO ON THE LOWER TRAJECTORIES MORE PROTECTIVE FACTORS YOU HAVE TO GO ON A HIGHER TRAJECTORY. KIDS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER INCOME COMMUNITIES HAVE MORE THESE PROTECTIVE FACTORS IN FEWER THESE RISK FACTORS SO THE NAME OF THE GAME FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT IS HOW DO WE INCREASE THE PROTECTIVE FACTORS. AND REDUCE THE RISK FACTOR SO WE HAVE MORE RESILIENCE IN THE COMMUNITIES AND IN THE FAMILY. AND THAT'S ABOUT HAROLD OLD RULE SALIENT SOCIAL CONNECTIONS KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. AND THERE ARE A WHOLE SET OF INDIVIDUAL STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY AND INTERVENE AND THERE'S A GREAT THERAPIES INFANT MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER CLIENT. THE MINDFULNESS THERAPIES I THINK OR SOMETHING THAT ARE REALLY HAVE LOTS OF PROBLEMS BUT WE NEED TO THINK BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THREE PERCENT OR FIVE PERCENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY FORTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION. AT PRESENT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE START SHIFTING THE CURVE FOR ALL THE CHILDREN HOW DO WE BUILD. COMMUNITIES MORE RESULTS ARE GONNA SHOW YOU THIS IT'S A LITTLE WONKY BUT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE AS ANY KIND OF DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOME. AND WHAT YOU SEE ON THE LEFT A POOR KIDS THERE ARE IN THE RED THEIR SORT OF. SHIFT TO THE LEFT IN THE RICH ONES YOURSELF TO THE RIGHT NEAR YOUR TRAUMATIZED AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN. AND ONE PART ONE WAY WE DO IS WE GOING ON SCREEN FOR THESE KIDS AND THEN TRY TO MOVE THEM THROUGH INDIVIDUAL THERAPY MOVE THEM OVER. ANOTHER WAY IS TO TARGET A WHOLE POPULATION THROUGH TARGETED APPROACHES TOWARDS WHOLE POPULATION. IF THE PREVALENCE OF GREY THERE IN TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY PERCENT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SCREEN ANYMORE YOU NEED TO PUT SOMETHING MORE UNIVERSAL IMPLIES. AND ONE IDEA BEEN GETS GREATER THE REAL PUT WAY TO MOVE IS TO USE UNIVERSAL SCURRIED SHIFTING YOU SHIFT THE ENTIRE CREW. IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGY TO WORK AT THE MARGIN TO WORK AT BRINGING IN THE TAIL OF THE CURVE VERSUS TRYING TO SHIFT THE WHOLE CURVE. AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE LEVERAGE AT THE TAIL OF THE CURVE WE CAN'T GET AHEAD OF THIS WHAT'S GOING ON BY JUST MOVING AT THE TAIL WE HAVE TO HAVE MEDIAN RENTS STRATEGIES TO MOVE FORWARD. SO WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THESE TRAJECTORIES WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND THAT ALL CHILDREN NEED FAMILY FOUNDATIONAL KINDS OF SUPPORT READING MINDFULNESS TRAINING HEALTH SERVICES PRESCHOOL ALL KIDS NEED THAT NOW. KIDS THAT HAVE A HIGHER RISK NEED OTHER KINDS OF SERVICES AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THOSE KIDS ARE AND GET THEM TO WOMAN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE SCREENFORM WE SHOULD JUST KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. OTHER COUNTRIES DO THIS WITH GREAT EASE THE COMPARATIVE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE HIGHER RISK YOU'RE GONNA NEED SPECIALIZED SERVICES SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHO GETS WHAT AND HOW. AND I'M JUST GONNA TALK ABOUT ONE PROGRAM THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROGRAMS BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT THIS HAS TO DO WITH FAMILIES AND REALLY SUPPORTING ALL FAMILIES. AND BY THINKING ABOUT FAMILIES THAT ADVERSITY IN FAMILIES IS MEASURABLE AND CON MEN ACROSS THE INCOME SPECTRUM FAMILY CONFLICT THIS CONFLICT THAT. IS MEASURABLE IMPACTS ON CHILDREN AND PART OF THIS IS THAT WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY TODAY WHERE WE'RE NOT MARRIED MARRYING SOMEBODY FROM OUR OWN TRIBE ANYMORE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THINGS WE ALL MARY STRANGERS REALLY. AND THEN WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE EVERYTHING THAT WE DO ONE PARENT TEEN RE PARENTING BURKE SOME FIGURE OUT THERE'S LOTS OF CONFLICT IN FAMILIES. AND WE HAVE FAMILY INCOME INSECURITY THAT BRIAN'S IS RIGHT UP TO HALF THE POPULATION IN THAT CREATES MORE CONFLICT. AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT BY COLLABORATIVE PARENT TEAM WE CAN ENJOY UNDER RESILIENCE AND FAMILIES AND IT REALLY. HELP THEM MOVE FORWARD. AND THIS A SOMETHING WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PARENTS WORKING IN THE STRESS OF TIME AND MONEY THAT FAN ALL FAMILIES NEED RIGHT NOW. AND THERE'S A THING CALLED FAMILY FOUNDATIONS A PROGRAM THAT WAS DEVELOPED AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY I HAVE NO STOCK AND IT IT'S JUST. THE ONE THAT'S BEEN ADVOCATED BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE IN THEIR REVIEW OF THINGS. IT'S REALLY CHEAP AND CHEERFUL IT'S DONE LIKE BIRTH CLASSES BUT FOUR CLASSES BEFORE BABY IS BORN FOR AFTER A BABY IS BORN AND IT'S ABOUT CORPS PARENTING IT'S NOT ABOUT TEACHING MOTHERS TO BE BETTER MOTHERS ABOUT. THE DYADIC RELATIONSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN A LOT OF WHAT INCREMENTAL HEALTH IT'S BEEN ABOUT ABOUT. TEACHING PARENTS HOW TO CO PARENT TOGETHER. AND HOW TO WORK TOGETHER AND I CAN ALSO WORK WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A CO PARENT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER OR YOUR AND IF THAT THAT'S THE SITUATION. AND THESE ARE THE EFFECTS THAT IT HAS. IT DECREASES PRETERM BIRTH AND LOW BIRTH WEIGHT. CRISIS HOSPITAL STAYS PARENTAL STRESS PARENTAL DEPRESSION. IT CHANGES THE WAY THE PARENTS PARENT. IT CREATES CONFLICTS IMPROVES CHILD MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR. CREATES COOPERATION AND AGE EIGHT THESE KIDS WORK MUCH BETTER IN SCHOOL ON THIS A SOME. I OF SOME APPROACH AGAIN THE COULD BE UNIVERSAL. SO THE OTHER THING THAT WE NEED BE SIDE UNIVERSAL THINGS AS WE NEED BETTER DATA AN IMPROVEMENT AND WE NEED TO HELP POPULATION LEVEL COMMUNITY DATA. THAT WE CAN MEASURE THESE TRAJECTORIES TO FOR INTERESTED IN TRAJECTORIES WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE OF THEM. THEY'RE MEASURING THEM IN CANADA OTHER MEASURING THEM IN AUSTRALIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE'RE JUST NOT DOING THAT. HERE'S THE CITY OF PASADENA WHERE THEY'VE MEASURE OF ALL OF THE CHILDREN AT AGE FIVE USING SOMETHING CALLED THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND THAT. AND THEY'RE MEASURING THEIR PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL COGNITIVE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MAPPING AT A NEIGHBORHOOD BY NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL MEN LOOKING AT WHO'S GETTING CHILD CARE AND WHO ISN'T GETTING CHILDCARE. SO THEY'RE MAKING POPULATION Y. DECISIONS FOR THE ENTIRE CITY OF PASADENA. AND CHANGING WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY CREATED AN EARLY CHILDHOOD POLICY FOR THE CITY OF PASADENA THEY HAVE A BLUEPRINT NOW OF HOW TO MOVE FORWARD THEY CREATED AN OFFICE OF THE YOUNG CHILD IN PASADENA. SIMILAR THINGS GOING ON A LONG BEACH SIMILAR THINGS GOING ON IN SANTA MONICA SIMILAR THINGS HAPPEN IN OTHER CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY THIS IS A CITY STRATEGY USING DATA. FOR THE ENTIRE CITY TO MOVE FORWARD. AND HAVE A MASTER PLAN FOR PASADENA. THIS IS THE MAGNOLIA COMMUNITY IN THIS SHOULD OF THE LOS ANGELES WHICH IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE BLOCKS IN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN THIS ISN'T ABOUT BUILDING A LITTLE. PROGRAM FOR TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED KIDS THIS IS ABOUT TAKING ALL ALL THE CHILDREN NEIGHBORHOOD. AGAIN THERE MAPPING ALL OF THE CHILDREN WHERE THEY LIVE THERE LOOKING AT HOW WELL THEY SPEAK AND WHAT THEIR LANGUAGE FUNCTION IS AND WHETHER THEIR PARENTS ARE READING TO THEM. AND THEN THERE SURVEYING THE PAPER THE PARENTS IN THE COMMUNITY AND SEEN WHETHER THEY HAVE RESILIENCE AND SUPPORTS AND VARIOUS THINGS. SO THESE ARE POPULATION STRATEGIES ABOUT SHIFTING THE ENTIRE CREW. THIS ISN'T ABOUT THROWING MORE MONEY INTO TREATMENT IT'S ABOUT THINKING ABOUT THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. LASTLY THINKING ABOUT FINANCES WE NEED THE BAY HAVING SILO BUSTING SOLUTIONS IN VARIOUS STATE INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL LEVERAGING LOTS OF WASTE OF MONEY IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OF PROCESS. WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT MONEY IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FROM VOLUME TO VALUE OVER THE NEXT. TEN YEARS. AND I PLOY BY IPHONE OUT FOR A REASON. TAKE YOUR IPHONE I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU HAVE IPHONES. AND YOU CLICK ON IT EVERYTHING STARTS TO JUGGLE. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ARE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN JUNGLE MODE. BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS THE INVISIBLE HAND OF VALUES GOING TO START MOVING THE THINGS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AROUND SO THAT WE GET. A HIGHER PERFORMING HEALTH SYSTEM IF IT'S LEFT UP TO ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS IT'LL BE ABOUT BUNDLING PAYMENTS FOR SHOULDERS HER HIPS ARE NEEDS. YOU KNOW AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE INCREASE VALUE IN THAT WAY. WE COULD ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE INCREASE VALUE BY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE INCREASE VALUE BY INVESTING MORE CHILDREN EARLY ON. AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT DOING THAT. IS BY THINKING ABOUT BUNDLING PAYMENT SO THAT WE TOOK PAYMENTS AND EXTENT OF. HAVING A BOTTLE FOR A NEW YOUR SHOULDER OPERATION WHAT IF WE HAD A BUNDLE FOR MINUS NINE MONTHS OF AGE TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE. WE PUT ALL OF THE PRIMARY HEALTH SERVICES INTO THAT BUNDLE WE PUT PRESCHOOL INTO THAT BUNDLE EARLY INTERVENTION AND WE GAVE IT TO COMMUNITIES AND SAY. YOU HAVE THIS MONEY IT'S INTEGRATED NOW YOU COMPOSED TOGETHER YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT INTEGRATED SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH PRIMARY CARE THE KIND OF THING THAT NADINE IS A DOING THAT SHE'S FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO. HOW DO WE MAKE THAT UNIVERSAL TITLE WE MAKE ALL THESE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE WE HAVE TO HAVE A FUNDING STRATEGY TO DO THAT? CITY WASHINGTON DC IS CONTEMPLATING THIS RIGHT NOW WORKING WITH THE URBAN INSTITUTE I'M THINKING ABOUT WHAT A LIFE CORRESPOND TO WOULD BE. AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE TOWARDS GEOGRAPHIC BOTTLE SO WHAT IF THE CITY OF PASADENA GOT THAT BOB DOLE AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO PULL THIS ALL TOGETHER FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN. AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALL GET THE SCHOOL READY TO LEARN WITHOUT A SCHISM WITH MORE PROTECTION. AND LASTLY THINK ABOUT CITIES AS THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND IDENTIFY WITH CITIES CONTROL THE SOCIAL TRANSPORTATION VARIOUS OTHER THINGS AND CITIES WHERE WE ACTUALLY GET STUFF DONE. AND SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WENT ON ALL CHILDREN THRIVE CITY LOOK LIKE WHERE WE CREATED A WAY OF PULLING THINGS TOGETHER FOR CITIES WHAT IF WE HAD TWENTY THIRTY FORTY OR TWO HUNDRED CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE ALL MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION. WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW FOR SOMETHING CALLED HE'LL CITIES HEALTHY EATING ACT OF LIVING CITIES THE KAISER PERMANENTE A PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES OF DOING WE HAVE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. HE'LL CITIES IN CALIFORNIA ANY OF MAYORS AND CITY COUNCILS TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY EATING ACTIVE LIVING BECAUSE OF THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC. WHAT IF WE WERE TO DO THIS FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW? SO. AS I SORT OF LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND THINK ABOUT POLICY I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE CITIES THAT ARE THRIVING THAT WE NEED A. FIFTEEN YEAR. YOU KNOW PROP UP PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IF YOU'D STATE IS CITIES HAVE TENURE BLUEPRINTS AND WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS UNIVERSAL FAMILY SUPPORTS PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE. HAD DATA FOR INNOVATION HAD INNOVATIVE FINANCING THAT YOU COULD ALLOW THEM TO DO HAD BUT WERE ABLE TO NETWORK WITH OTHER CITIES AND HAVE A COMMON PLATFORM WE WOULD HAVE THE THINGS IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE MOVEMENT TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS PROBLEM ON. THANK YOU DOCTOR. HAVING HAD ALL THREE OF YOU PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW I WANTED TO OPEN IT UP NOW TO THE DIET TO SEE IF WE HAD ANY QUESTIONS THAT. PEOPLE HAD OF THE EXPERTS AND SO WITHOUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVIEW. HI THERE I APPRECIATE ALL THE INFORMATION I WAS OF. I TAUGHT FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. AND SO I CAN RELATE WITH UP EVERYTHING THAT YOU WERE DISCUSSING THE. WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION RIGHT NOW IS THIS? SILOS THAT WE LIVE IN AND. I EIGHT THIS IS MY SECOND YEAR AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST. HURDLE I BELIEVE. IS THAT ALL OF THAT THE COMMITTEES ALL OF THE AYE DEPARTMENTS ALL WORK IN SILENCE AND SO. WHAT YOU SAID WAS GREAT AND FANTASTIC? BY. THAT THIS CAN ACT BETWEEN THE STATE. AND THE FILES WITHIN THE STATE RIGHT AND THEN WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES IS WHERE. QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THE PROBLEM IS. THE PROGRAM SOUND GREAT A FANTASTIC AND. I'M AFRAID THAT WE'RE GONNA LEAVE OUT HERE AND SAY OH THAT WAS GREAT THAT WAS FANTASTIC AND THEN WE JUST GO ON ABOUT OUR REGULAR BUSINESS. SO I THINK WHERE WE NEED HELP ARE AT LEAST PERSONALLY IS HOW DO WE PUT IT TOGETHER UP HERE. BECAUSE WE FUNCTION IN SILOS I'M THE CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES IN ALL OF THE FOSTER KIDS AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES AND ALL THAT BUT THERE'S NO CONNECTION. SAY WITH THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY AND FOSTER KIDS GO THROUGH THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY BUT WE'VE YET TO HAVE. AYE AND I LOOK OVER THERE BECAUSE OF MY COLLEAGUE ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY IS AND. CHARGE OF THE EDUCATION FOLKS I I WOULD LIKE TO SAY BUT I ANYWAY. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENTS WE DON'T HAVE. A CONNECTION. WE DON'T HAVE A CONNECTION. WHERE WERE IN CYCLES SO? HOW AM I AM OBVIOUSLY WE YOU CAN? GIVE ME THE SOLUTION RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD LIKE TO. AND THEN LIST YOU I GUESS FOR SOME HELP ON HOW WE CAN MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS WERE NOT. AGAIN UP. FOSTER KIDS IS A NOT TO CONNECTION WITH EDUCATION BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND HOW DO WE DO THAT. HERE. DOWN THERE I CAN YOU KNOW DOWN THERE I MEANT IN MY COMMUNITY YOU KNOW WHAT I BY MY CITY BOTTOM PARK BY WE'RE PART OF THE HEALTHY EATING COMMUNITIES. WITH WHICH WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WAS A GREAT PROGRAM AND SO I CAN SEE HOW IT COULD WORK. LOCALLY BUT AT THE STATE LEVEL THE CYCLES THAT WE LIVE AND. ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER SO I PERSONALLY AM ASKING FOR SOME HELP BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS A GREAT PRESENTATION BUT I'M AFRAID THAT WE'RE GONNA WALK OUT AND GO. THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS IS GOING TO GO ON MY DESK AND THEN WE. PICK IT UP AGAIN NEXT YEAR SO IF YOU CAN HELP WITH SOME. REAL SOLUTIONS AS TO HOW I CAN MAKE THAT CONNECTION AND HOW WEAK WE CAN MAKE CONNECTIONS I SAID AND HUMAN SERVICES. DOCTOR ARAMBULA IS ON THE COMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW AND SO WE HAVE ALL THESE GREAT. AMAZING FOLKS READY TO WORK BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE HOW THEN AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO BE PART OF MY INBOX AND SOMEBODY'S GONNA PUT IT IN THE BOX AND. WE'LL SEE IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR WHEN WE HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT'S SO THAT'S MY COMMENT AND. TERMS FOR YOU AND I ARE DR APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU ARE ALL THREE OF YOU. BUT THE INFORMATION IS GREAT AND IT'S YOU KNOW I FEEL ENERGIZED AND REALLY LIGHT YOU'RE LOOKING AT REAL. SOLUTIONS TO REAL PROBLEMS I WAS A TEACHER FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND IT WAS ADHD AT ALL TIMES. I TIED IN FONTANA WHICH IS A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY. A THIRD AFRICAN AMERICAN A THIRD ARE HISPANIC AND THAT THIRD. CAUCASIAN AND ALL HAD THE SAME ISSUE LOW INCOME. AND THEY WERE ALL PORT AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT A COMMUNITY LIKE THAT I CAN'T SAY AWAITS THE YOU KNOW THE HISPANICS OR THE AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE THE WHITE IT WAS ALL THE SAME. SYMPTOMS AND HOW DO WE. GET THAT MESSAGE OUT BECAUSE THE FIRST THING IS ALL THEIR A DHD LET'S GIVE HIM MEDICATION. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR EDUCATORS AND TEACHERS' TO REALLY DEAL WITH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION OR THAT SUPPORT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A AIDES IN THE CLASSROOM ANYMORE. YEAH AND AND SO HOW DO WE GET YOUR INFORMATION TO THE. YOU KNOW TOO AGAIN TO THE FOLKS THAT. ARE OUT OVER MEDICATING ORDER NOT MEDICATING WHAT WHICHEVER. A. WHATEVER WE CHOOSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE OVER MEDICATION AND NO MEDICATION FOR THE ONES THAT THAT DO NEED THE HELP BUT THE TEACHERS ARE ARE ARE. QUITE FRANKLY IN AN ISLAND AND OTHER THEY ARE AND A SURVIVAL MODE AS WELL BECAUSE. YOU KNOW THEY'RE BEING ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE BEING PUT ON. TO TO ALL THE TEACHERS BUT NO RESOURCES AND NO REAL REAL SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE THE PROGRAM OF THE WEEK EVER IT'S GONNA SOLVE EVERYBODY'S PROBLEMS I CALLED THE PROGRAM DID YOU ARE IS LIKE OUR GONNA RESOLVE ALL THAT. ISSUES IN EDUCATION BUT IF WE DON'T LOOK AT THE ROOT OF THE CAUSES OF THESE ISSUES THEN WHENEVER WE'RE SPINNING OUR WHEELS WERE NEVER GOING TO HAVE. THE ALL OF OUR KIDS DRIVING AND BEING EDUCATED IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH THESE THESE ISSUES. I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION BY HELP ME. EMPLOYMENT OR AT LEAST WITH SOME IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN BRING SOME OF THESE RESOURCE IT'S OR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS TO OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE SO DESPERATELY. IN NEED OF THIS SO IT'S MORE OF A CO A COMMENT NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT I DO IMPLORE. YOU TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN ALL PARTICIPATE IN REAL CHANGE AND NOT JUST HAVE THIS WONDERFUL CONVERSATION AND THEN. THE DOCUMENTS GOING UP AND UP IN THE FILE. SO MAYBE THAT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE FOR ME TO JUMP AND TO EXPLAIN OUR THINKING OF WHY WE SET UP THE HEARING IN THIS WAY. SO IN. MEDICINE WE ALWAYS DESCRIBED HIM AS SOAP NOTES AND MAYBE YOU CAN PREFERRED ON BUT SUBJECTIVE OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS AND PLANNING TO TODAY'SHEARING IS SET UP IN THAT SAME WAY TO. SO WE WILL. FURTHER HERE OF AN ANALYSIS AND A PLANNED COMING FORWARD AND SAT DOWN. EXPECTED UP COME UP WITH ONE RIGHT ON THE FRONT. BUT BUT DIDN'T WANT TO COMMENT IF I COULD BECAUSE THE IMPORTANCE FOR US IS TO GET UPSTREAM. AND THE REASON WHY WE HELD THIS HEARING TOGETHER HIS BONES THAT HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION YOU HAVE. THE CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND HUMAN SERVICES WHO ARE HERE WHO SEE THESE PROBLEMS DOWNSTREAM AND. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE THREE YOUNG KIDS MYSELF BUT NO THE IMPORTANCE THAT THESE EARLY YOUNG YEARS HAVE. AND THAT APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS FROM US AS A STATE CAN SAVE US MONEY. DOWNSTREAM. AND WAS DRAWN IF I COULD TO DOCTOR THOMPSON YOU HAD A COMMENT THAT. THE EFFECT OF COMICS STRESS ON. THOSE WHO HAVE YOUNGER RACES MAY LEAD TO DECREASED EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. THAT. IDEA IS A POWERFUL ONE IF WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE TO HELP OUR GATE THROUGH TWELVE. SYSTEM BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT KIDS WHO START BEHIND STAY BEHIND. AND IF WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM TO DEAL WITH THE TOXIC STRESS AT A YOUNGER AGE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY SOLVE A. CRITICAL PIECE OF THE PROBLEM OUR STATE FACES IN EDUCATING OUR COMMUNITIES AND THESE ARE MAJOR SYSTEMATIC SHIPS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE EASY FOR US AS A STATE. TWO ONE SILO WORDS TO FIGURE OUT HERE TODAY BUT REALLY WANTED TO. HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AMONGST OUR COLLEAGUE SO THAT IT CAN. COME TO OUR THINKING AS WERE TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS GOING FORWARD BUT WANTED IF I COULD DOCTOR HELFAND YOU ENDED BY SAYING THAT THERE WERE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WERE IMPLORING ARE EXPLORING MODELS THAT ARE USED AND I'M REALLY FOCUSING IF I CAN ON THE SCALABILITY. HOW DO WE GO FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO EITHER LOOKING AT REGIONAL MODELS OR EXAMPLES BUT WHAT COULD WE AS A STATE BE DOING AND ARE THERE SPECIFIC COUNTRIES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AS YOUR EXPLOITS? YEAH. I THINK THEM TO RESPOND TO BOTH YOUR QUESTIONS THERE ARE. STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE IS THAT LED THE DATA ON THE MONEY YOU'RE REALLY BOTH IMPORTANT DATA BY HAVING MEASURES ON WHOLE COMMUNITIES. WE GET PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT SECTORS TO START TO SEE THE PROBLEM IS THE SAME AND THEY START USING THE SAME MEASURE. SO YOU START USING THAT NEEDY AYE THAT HOW HOW ALL OF OUR KIDS ARE DOING WHETHER YOU'RE FROM HEALTH OR EDUCATION OR SOCIAL SERVICE CHILD WELFARE. ALL USING THE SAME MEASURE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. IS THAT THE CITY STARTS USING A. THE PROVIDERS START USING THAT THE PARENTS START USING IT SO WHEN YOU HAVE EVERYBODY USING THE SAME MEASURE YOU'RE TURNING DATA NOT JUST AND INFORMATION. IT BECOMES CURRENCY THAT BECOMES LIKE MONEY IT BECOMES VALUABLE TO EVERYBODY AND IT HAS EXCHANGE VALUE PEOPLE START MAKING DECISIONS. SO ONE WAY TO BREAK DOWN SILOS TO GET EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT THE PROBLEM THE OTHER IS OVER IS AROUND THE MONEY ISSUES. AND THERE ARE A WHOLE SET OF STRATEGIES AND WAIVERS THROUGH MEDICAID VARIOUS OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPLORING AND ARE DOING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND. TRYING THAT WE COULD BE DOING HERE THE COUNTRIES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING MOST CLOSELY WITH OR CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. AND THAT CAN'T AUSTRALIA RIGHT NOW MEASURES EVERY SINGLE FIVE YEAR OLD WHEN THEY START SCHOOL USING THAT SAME MEASURE THAT I WAS SHOWING. AND THEY MEASURE THEIR PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL CAR GOING OF SOCIAL BALLOTS THAT HEALTH OF AND DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY FIVE YEAR OLD. IT PREDICTS. THEIR THIRD GRADE AND. READING AND MATH SCORE SO AND WE'VE JUST DONE A STUDY IN ORANGE COUNTY WITH GREG DUNCAN. WE WERE WE DID THE SAME MEASUREMENT WENT PREDICTS THE KIDS AND ORANGE COUNTY'S SO YOU GET THE START TO SEE WHAT YOUR KIDS ARE DOING SO THERE'S A DATA YOU CAN SEE. AND IN CANADA RIGHT NOW THEY NOT ONLY MEASURE THE IN VANCOUVER IN BRITISH COLUMBIA THEY MEASURE ALL KIDS AT AGE FIVE. THEY HAVE ANOTHER MEASURE THAT IT'S DOWN AT AGE NINE AND ANOTHER ELEVEN IN THE. GETTING WHAT FOR FIFTEEN SO THEY CAN MEASURE TRAJECTORIES OF CHILDREN AND THEY THEN INTEGRATE THE DATA WITH ALL THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AND PERSONAL DATA. AND THAT'S GOING ON HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALSO I WAS AT A MEETING JUST LAST WEEK WITH THE INTER OPERATIVE KEPT COLLABORATIVE. SILICON VALLEY. HOUSE EIGHT SILICON VALLEY REGIONAL DATA TRUST THAT'S TAKEN ALL THE SCHOOL DATA CHILD WELFARE DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH DATA AND IT'S ALL BEING COMBINED TOGETHER SO IT'S STARTING TO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS TO DO THAT. SO ALL OVER THE WORLD PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO BREAK DOWN SILOS. WHETHER IT'S IN ENGLAND OR AUSTRALIA CANADA AND THERE'S OTHER STRATEGIES SO YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL SOME OF IT IS SORT OF HARVESTING IN DOING THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCREENING OUT. AND SORT OF SEEN WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES AND A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCHCOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS BRINGING YOU THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU. SOMEONE ANOTHER CARD. YES THANK YOU AND I KNOW WE HAVE IT. ANOTHER PANEL ON THAT PRACTITIONERS POINT OF VIEW AND SOLUTIONS AND SO YOU KNOW IT. JUMPED THERE BUT WHAT I WILL ASK I WILL ASK YOU THIS AND SO. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY AS WE SEE FROM THE SLIDES AND AND THANK YOU FOR JUST BREAKING IT DOWN IN PLAIN ENGLISH TO TO IT TO US AS FAR AS HOW THE BRAIN WORKS. BUT. YOU KNOW THE HOT THE HIGHER THE SCORED HIGHER THE IMPACTSTHE MORE NEGATIVE THINGS CAN HAPPEN LATER IN LIFE IT AND YOU SEE THOSE THINGS LATER LIKE PROBABLY STUFF A TEN YEAR OLD HAS A. HAS A SEVENTIES SCORE MAYBE THERE. LIKE THE GARAGE ON FIRE DOING YOU KNOW THAT STUFF AND IN THERE YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND SO YOU CALLED THE YOU KNOW RED ALERT TO YOU KNOW FIRED ENGINE COMES AND. PUTS OUT THE FIRE WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU. WHERE IS IF YOU'RE A THREE YEAR OLD? YOU COULD SELL THAT FEAR IN THE FIGHTER FLIGHT IT'S HARDEST TO SEE THAT. SO JUSTIN IN YOUNG IN ME I I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED THIS LIKE YOU KNOW I I HAD LITTLE KIDS AND THEIR TWINS IN THE COULDN'T. THEY WEREN'T SPEAKING RIGHT AWAY SO INTO THE PEDIATRICIANS LOCAL MAYBE THEY CAN'T HEAR. ANOTHER TO SPEAK IN THAT WHEN TALKS OVER THAT THAT THREE OR FOUR. THEY WENT WE WENT TO GO SEE A SPECIALIST TO SEE IF WE NEED TO GET IN THE ALTAR REGIONAL YOU KNOW THAT. I'M NOT SURE IT'S CALLED. AND SO I'M I JUST ALWAYS WONDERED IT WILL IF YOU HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD AND DID YOU HAVE A FIVE ACES SCORE WIDE ISN'T THAT WHY DO WE HAVE JUST LIKE. A RED BUTTON GOING OFF AND THEN WE CALL THE HOTLINE AND THEN WE KNOW THAT WE CAN WELL FIRST YET THAT SCREENING FOR THAT WHICH IS I GUESS. THE CONDITION. BUT THEN YOU KNOW THE INTERVENTIONS THAT TREATMENT AND SO FORTH SO HOW IS IT SO COMPLICATED THAT WE THAT WE CAN'T. FIND THESE LITTLE KIDS AND PASS UNDER FIVE THAT WE NOW HAVE. A REALLY HIGH SCORE AND. AND HAVE SOME TYPE OF ALERT SYSTEM GOING OFFER PROSTITUTE IN ROLE THESE KIDS IN SOME TYPE OF. TREATMENT IS GOING TO HELP THEIR SIX. WELL. WE DO SEE HER. AND A SKILLED EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHER. SEES THE RED LIGHTS GOING OFF ALL THE TIME MIGHT MY WIFE IS ONE OF THOSE EDUCATORS SHE IS PART OF WHAT INFORMS. PRACTICALLY THE RESEARCH THAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT. IT'S A CHILD WHO IS ARE OUT OF CONTROL WITH PHYSICAL AGGRESSION. OUR IT'S A THREE YEAR OLD WHOSE WAY OF EXPRESSING FRUSTRATION IS TO BY OTHER KIDS. OR IT CAN BE A CHILD WHO IS WITHDRAWN. ARE MORE THAN JUST THE SHALL I DISCOVERED CHILD WHO'S JUST TEMPERAMENTALLY. INHIBITED BUT THE CHILD WHO WITHDRAWS FROM ACTIVITIES THAT OTHER KIDS WOULD ENJOY DOING. ARM IT'S A CHILD WHO HAS DISTORTED ATTACHMENTS TO PARENTS IF PART OF THEIR FACES ARE COMING FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING AT HOME. AREN'T. YOU KNOW THE ADOLESCENTS WHO ARE IN TROUBLE DRAW OUR ATTENTION BECAUSE THAT SOMETIMES NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES THEY ENGAGE IN CONTACT THAT CONDUCT THAT COMES TO THE ATTENTION OF AUTHORITIES. THE PART OF THE REASON THAT THE TEACHERS THAT I WORK WITH ARE SAYING THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED IS THEY'RE SEEING THE RED LIGHTS GOING OFF. IN THE THREE YEAR OLD SON THAT THEIR CARRY FOR BUT WHAT ABOUT THE RED LIGHT FIRST YOU KNOW EITHER MAYBE KID SAID MEDI CAL PATIENTS OR WHAT. GONNA GOES TO THE LOCAL. PEDIATRICIAN AND THEY'RE DOING. AT THE BACK YOU KNOW AISER MAKE TRACKS AND WHEN SOMEONE ADDS UP TO FIVE OR MORE IT GOES IN A SPECIAL FILE NEW AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT. YOUNGSTER IN THAT FAMILY HAS SOME TYPE IT EXTRA BENEFIT LIKE WE DO IF YOU CAN HEAR YOU CAN'T SEE WE SET OUR HEARTS GOOD VERSUS GOOD FOR SOCIETY TO INVEST EARLIER IN THE SAGA. SO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DO EVERYDAY AT THE CENTER FOR YOUTH WELL THAT'S BUT I WILL TELL YOU WE ARE ENTIRELY PRIVATELY PHILOSOPHICALLY FUND HEAD WE DO IT BECAUSE WE RAY THAT OUT OF MONEY TO DO IT AND. AND WE DO IT TO BE ABLE TO PILOT THE TH MODEL SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE THEM AND RECOMMEND THEM AS BEST PRACTICES. BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT THE. THAT THREE YEAR OLD CHILD HIT THAT I HAD THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE UP WHO WASN'T GROWING. HER DEVELOPMENT WAS NORMAL HER BEHAVIOR WAS NORMAL SOME KIDS HAVE. AT BEANO WITHDRAWAL AT. THAT MENTAL HEALTH IN TERMS BEHAVIORAL SEVEN TIMES AT CETERA AND SOME KIDS HAVE FREQUENT INFECTION IN FACT THAT PARTICULAR CHILD HER YOUNGER BROTHER WHO IS NINE MONTHS AT THE TIME. HOW THAT AND A SCORE OF FIVE HE HAD HAD TO PNEUMONIAS AND FOR AARON FACTIONS WITHIN HIS FIRST YEAR OF LIFE AND AFTER WE STARTED THIS TO GENERATION ALL? THAT INTERVENTION TRAUMA INFORMED INTERVENTION HE DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE OTHER INVASIVE INFECTION HE HAD NO EAR INFECTIONS NO PNEUMONIAS. FOLLOWING THAT AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO OFTENTIMES THE KIDS WHO HAVE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES ARE THE ONES WHO ARE RECOGNIZED. THE KIDS WHO DON'T HAVE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES OR THE KIDS WHO ARE OFTEN PREVERBAL. WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THEM UNTIL THE UNTIL THE PROCESS IS PRETTY FAR GONE AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO SCREEN EVERY CHILD AS PER A ROUTINE PART OF PEDIATRIC CARE. AND HOW WE DO THAT A HAS TO DO IT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT. CHANGES TO EP SPT THERE TO THINK THAT I CAN RECOMMEND TO THERE'S SO THERE'S ONE. WHICH IS THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND AND SAY EVERY PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW BY WHATEVER THE YEAR IS TWENTY TWENTY YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PROTOCOL THAT HOW TO SCREEN AND RESPOND TO IT AND. TO ACES IN YOUR PRIMARY CARE SETTING RIGHT SO YOU KNOW GIVE FOLKS TIME TO BE ABLE TO BUY. YOU KNOW LEARN THE BEST PRACTICES AND TRAIN AND TRAIN THEIR STAFF BUT THAT'S REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND YOU KNOW THE WAY WE CONNECT SOME OF THESE LINKS TO OUR SYSTEMS AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT A POP POLICY SPECIALIST I'M A PEDIATRICIAN I RUN MY ORGANIZATION BUT. YOU KNOW THING THINGS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS IN ORDER TO GET INTO SCHOOL EVERY CHILD HAS TO HAVE A IT OR TO GET INTO KINDERGARTEN THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PHYSICAL. THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR IMMUNIZATIONS THEY HAVE TO HAVE A TB TEST AND THAT FORM SHOULD SAY THEY ALSO HAVE TO HAPPEN A SCREEN. WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT THE SCORE JUST THAT A PRIMARY CARE CLINICIAN WHETHER IT'S A FAMILY PRACTITIONER PEDIATRICIAN OR A NURSE PRACTITIONER WHOEVER. HAS SCREEN THAT CHILD FOR A SAYS BECAUSE WHAT THAT ALLOWS US TO DO IS TO CREATE NUMBER ONE A SYSTEM WHERE THE CHILD IS NOT BEING SCREENS. FOR A SAYS THAT AT THEIR AT EVERY VENUE RITE AID'S WHERE WHEN THAT SCREENING IS MEANINGFUL. THEY HAVE THE LEGAL PROTECTION SO THAT WHEN PARENTS ARE DISCLOSING THE THINK IT'S IT'S PROTECTED BY HIPAA. RIGHT AND. WE ALSO HAVE A AND. A MECHANISM FOR. BOTH MORAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT THAT THEY WHEN WHEN A CLINICIAN WHETHER IT'S A DOCTOR OR. YOU KNOW PRIMARY CARE CLINICIAN THAT WHEN THEY SCREEN. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TRAINED TO AND UNDERSTAND I'M WHAT THE IMPACT IS BOTH ON HEALTH. AND ON MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ON DEVELOPMENT AND IT IS OUR JOB TO SCREEN SURVEY THAT AND FOLLOW IT UP AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT SCREENING IN PRIMARY CARE. IS THAT WE FOLLOW CHILDREN FROM THE TIME THEY'RE ZERO UNTIL THEY'RE YOU KNOW I THOUGHT SOME TWENTY YEAR OLD THE MY PACKETS RIGHT FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR. GREAT BUT THIS IS WE HAVE BOTH A OUT A PROFESSIONAL AND A LEGAL MECHANISM. TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD THE SCREEN AND THEN WE NEED TO HAVE THESE REDUNDANT SYSTEM THESE CONNECTION BETWEEN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. AND OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THAT ONE LITTLE FORM IF IT SAID THAT EVERY CHILD HAD TO BE SCREEN BEFORE THEY STARTED. KINDERGARTEN CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW THAT WOULD MAKE THE LIVES EASIER. OF EDUCATORS. OF PARENTS A PROVIDERS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OF CHILL. THERE'S A PART OF. AND DOCTOR HEALTH INS PRESENTATION WHERE YOU SAID YOU FOCUSED ON A CERTAIN SEGMENT IT SEEMS THAT THE SCREENING. ABILITY GIVES US THAT ABILITY TO FOCUS OUR INTERVENTIONS ON A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. THAT HAS A HIGHER TO SCORE I'M INTRIGUED TO HEAR ABOUT. THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO INCREASE THE SCREEN. I'M AYE MATE. THROW UP THROW THIS IN THEIR OWN WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP IF WE CAN BUT THERE'S A WORKING GROUP WE HAVE ON. WORKING WITH A SAYS INTO EPS DETAIL AND WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE AFTERWARDS TO. SEE IF YOU WOULD WANT TO SIT ON THIS WORKING GROUP TO HELP US AS WE. MOVE THIS IDEA FORWARD WITH THE STATE BUT I'D LIKE THAT VERY MUCH WE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO HELP WITH THAT AND THEN I. DOCTOR HEALTH AND ALL YOU JUMP IN BED ASSEMBLYMAN MATHIS HAD A COMMENT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THOUGH. A LOT OF GREAT POINTS IN A LOTTERY POINTS FROM THE OTHER MEMBERS. WE WE'VE DEFINITELY GOT HIT THIS. FROM A HOLISTIC APPROACH. BRIDGING BOTH THE IN IN THE MIDDLE HEALTH SIDE AND THE EDUCATION SIDE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE IT IT'S ONE OF THE SAME. ARMED SO IT'S EXCITING TO ACTUALLY HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THINGS I LOOK AT THE ESPECIALLY ON THE BUDGETARY SIDE IT IS. AND AND AND I'M SPEAKING AS A. FATHER WITH TWO CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. ARM. NO NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS TO GO TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS. THEM IN A BEEN THROUGH THIS. BOY. IT. ALWAYS SH BRINGS A QUESTION IN MY MIND WHEN I'M SITTING IN LIKE AN IEP MEETING OR SOMETHING AND I HAVE. SEVERAL. SOCIAL WORKERS ONE ONE FROM EDUCATION WHAT FOR MENTAL HEALTH LAW AND I'M GOING. YOU'RE ALL PAID BY TAX DOLLARS AND I REALLY JUST NEED ONE A FEW THAT UNDERSTANDS MY KID INSIDE AND OUT. IN A NOT NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT ALL GREAT PEOPLE THERE FOR THEIR AMAZING IN THEIR PHENOMENAL PLATE. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SPREAD THE FUNDING. ALL THE WAY ACROSS IN A MAKES YOU WONDER. NOT HIGH SCHOOL YOU HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW GUIDED SCOUTS FOR THE GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH. WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT IT AS WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS YOU KNOW AND OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CHANGE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS ALL OF IDEA THREE BUILD THEM? BLOOD. YOU KNOW FROM OKAY YOU HAVE YOUR CHILD YOU GO WHEN. A AND NOW YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR PEDIATRICIANS THAT TRACK YOUR KIDS ALL THE WAY THROUGH HOW COME WE DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE OWNS THAT OF HAVING A SOCIAL WORKER THROUGH SCHOOL. AND ANOTHER ONE THROUGH THE COUNTY WE END UP WITH TWO OR THREE. WHY ARE WE JUST HAVING ONE THAT'S TRACKING IN MAKING SURE THIS CHILD'S GETTING EVERY SINGLE THING THAT THEY CAN GET? THEY ARE CHINA FIGURED OUT AS A AS A BUDGETARY SIDE. BECAUSE OF I OF ONE PERSON IS A PARENT OR ALLEN GOT A CALL ONE PERSON TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU KNOW I THOUGHT OF THE FUTURE SENATE TALK TO THIS GUY THOUGHT OF THE TEACHERS. THAT MAKES LIFE SO MUCH LESS COMPLICATED FOR THE PARENTS. OUR. MADE IT BE PHENOMENAL INSTEAD OF. TRY TO CRAM TWENTY PEOPLE IN A ROOM TO HAVE AN IEP MEETING. IN ANY RIGHT THE THE EARLIER YOU CAN CATCH IT. THE BETTER I HAVE A SON WHO'S ASPERGERS AUTISM OF ANOTHER LOT VALUES THREE WAS FUNDED BY FOR THE I MEAN IT'S. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IT. SO I LOVE HEARING THE CONVERSATION YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON THE DATA THAT THE MORE DATA WE CAN GET THE BETTER. ON DISH CURIOUS TO SEE WHERE THESE CONVERSATIONS ALL ACTUALLY GAL. AS US APPEAR ON THE DIETS PURSUE OUR TEN YEAR. DISCUSSING ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW THE NEXT TEN YEARS IS FOR THE CHILDREN THAT THAT WE HAVE IN THAT WE REPRESENT. IT'S OF THANK ALLAH FOR TO THE DISCUSSION BROTHERHOOD. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER DOCTOR HELFAND. RAINY. I WAS A BIG HUGE ADVOCATE IN RESEARCH AROUND DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING FOR KIDS. AND. THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO BECAUSE ALL THESE KIDS WERE FLYING UNDER THE RADAR IN GETTING TH SCHOOL SCREEN KIDS WE DO NOT HAVE SERVICE OF SOME PLACE ONCE WE SCREEN THEM FOR THEM TO GET WHAT THEY NEED. OFTENTIMES. AND. I. WOULD ONLY DIFFER WITH NADINE AND THAT MEANS. HAS A A PROGRAM AND A SERVICE CENTER THAT'S IT IT'S AN OUTLINE. EVERYBODY ELSE IT DOESN'T PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND WHEN YOU SCREAM FOR A SYSTEM A COMMON PEDIATRIC CLINIC THEY DON'T HAVE. THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING. AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BACK UP SCREENING ETHICALLY WITH A AN ABILITY TO RESPOND BECAUSE TO SCREEN AND NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY WITH PROVEN STUFF THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. IS IS. YOU KNOW. CAN BE QUESTION IF IF THAT'S AN ETHICAL THING TO DO. YOU KNOW WHEN HER CLINIC YOU CAN DO THAT. BECAUSE SHE CAN RESPOND AND RESPONDS APPROPRIATELY LEGACY THAT THAT THE DIFFICULTY PART THERE AS AS A PARENT. AND AND I I'VE GOT TO SEVERAL PARENT WORKGROUPS IS. YOU MEET WITH THE PEDIATRICIAN YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR CHILD. YOU'RE TRYING THEN THE NEW BEGAN KIND OF THIS IN IN THIS IS COMING FROM AYE NOTING THROUGH AND. PARA GROUPS FOR THE LAST DECADE. E. YOU KIND OF START DOING THE GUESSING GAME. OF OF PARENTS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WITH THE DIAGNOSIS IS AND THE PEDIATRICIANS TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND THAT I LOVE YOU ALL OF PEDIATRICIANS. BUT YOU'RE NOT PSYCHOLOGISTS. IT WON'T WILL NOT OF ON A SENIOR YOU'LL PUT IT WOULD IN GENERAL. AND. IT A A LITERALLY HAD TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE PEDIATRICIAN AT ONE POINT AND REMIND THEM YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST YOUR PEDIATRICIAN. AND WHEN MY KIDS SICK YOU'RE GREAT BUT. YOU'RE NOT A SHRINK. AND TRY TO GET THE REFERRAL AND DELETE THE INSURANCES AND ALL OF THAT. BUT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S WE CAN'T ALLOW A SYSTEM BECAUSE WERE AFRAID. ESPECIALLY MANY OF US REPRESENT RURAL AREAS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA OUR RURAL AREAS. THE SERVICES ARE IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE BIG CITY YOU DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES. AND THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO WORK ON. AND SO. BUT WE HAVE TO STILL. MAKE SURE WERE FINDING OUT WHAT'S GOING ON OF THESE CHILDREN APPS BECAUSE WITH WITH THE AMOUNT OF SPLIT HOMES IN THESE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. IN THE NUMBERS JUST KEEP SKYROCKETING. YOU KNOW THAT THEY THAT GOES INTO AND OTHER FACTORS. IN CELL. THE PEOPLE FROM TO. TO THE PARENTS HAVE TO KNOW. IT HELPS THEM PARA HELPS THAT ALL ALL THESE CONNECTIONS IN IN YOU'RE SURE GONNA DEATH YOU KNOW ALRIGHT. SO. WE HAVE TO DO IT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO IT POOL. AWAIT ALSO YOUR YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO YOU'VE GOT HOW THE SERVICES MATCH. AND WE'VE GOTTA GET THOSE OUT TO THE RURAL AREAS BUT WE CAN IT WAIT WHEN YOU SAY SIR THAT THEY YOU YOU YOU ALSO HOLD BACK ETHICALLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THE PARENTS NEED TO KNOW. THE PARENTS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO KNOW BECAUSE. SOME OF THE CHILDREN DEPENDING ON WHAT IT IS ARE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS AT HOME. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEIR CHILD. IN INTO THEM ONE MINUTE IT'S THERE SWEET BABY IN THE NEXT MINUTE. IT'S SOMETHING DEVASTATING. AND SO TO TO NOT. LOOK AT THE CHILD AND NOT DIAGNOSED BECAUSE THERE'S NOT SERVICES AVAILABLE NOW LOCAL AREA. DAD'S DO AN AND ON JUSTICE FOR THOSE PARENTS AND FOR THAT CHILD'S FUTURE. SO WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS FIGURED OUT. ALONG THOSE LINES MAYBE IT'S A GOOD WAY FOR US TO SEGUE TOWARDS THE NEXT CONVERSATION. BUT. MAYBE THAT WAY I CAN FRAME IT IS TO ECHO OF. RECURRING TALKING POINT I'VE HAD APPEAR WHICH IS WE HAVE TO HAVE PROVIDERS TAKING CARE OF OUR PATIENTS. AND WE MAY NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDERS NEEDED TO ALLOW US TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. BUT AFTER WE COLLECT THE INFORMATION WE THEN HAVE TO HAVE THAT COURAGEOUS CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. ABOUT WHAT WE DO AS A COMMUNITY AND HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE TRUMP. BECAUSE THE SALIENT POINTS TO ME IS THAT HE SAYS ARE INCREDIBLY CALM. THAT HAPPENED TO US ALL AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS A STATE TASK ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS SO WE CAN HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH SOME OF THE ANSWERS. THANK YOU PANEL FOR COMING HERE TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT PANEL AS WELL THANK YOU I AND MICHAEL. NICHOLAS I'M SORRY. HI GOOD AFTERNOON. SO FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT IT WAS GREAT TO BE INVOLVED WITH SOME OF MY HEROES IN THE FIELD. SO THANKS AND THANKS FOR CONVENING THIS. AND I'M GONNA GET RIGHT INTO OUR UP SOME OF THE NITTY GRITTY QUESTIONS I HEARD PARTICULARLY AROUND THE NEXUS OF HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION. AND I COME TO THIS FROM A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. FOR TWELVE YEARS I WAS THE HEALTH DIRECTOR IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. I AND THAT WAS A LOT OF ONE OF THE FIFTH OR SIXTH LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE. WE WORKED WITH FOURTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIRTEEN NINE ONE RECEIVING CENTERS. TWENTY TWO HOSPITALS WE HAD FIFTY SIX THOUSAND CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY. AND THAT TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN LIVING IN OUT OF HOME CARE. I'M GONNA GET TO A MINUTE FLIP THROUGH SOME SLIDES QUICKLY BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO GET TO HOW WE ADDED TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN TO REPEAT TO TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SIX YEARS. AND MADE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THE FIRST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE NATION TO HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH. IN OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE SCHOOLS. SOME MIGHT TAKE US THROUGH THE VERY DETAILED SPECIFIC MECHANISMS THRIFT ABOUT HOW WE DID THAT AND HOW WE FUNDED IT. I THAT AGENCY IRAN I'M ON THE BOTTOM LEFT HANDCORNER IN THE SMALL PRINT THERE YOU'LL SEE. IT WE ARE AN EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR AGENCY. BUT OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICE WAS FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN MILLION OVER HALF OF THE LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES BUDGET IS ROUTINELY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE TALK ABOUT ACES BECAUSE AS YOU HEARD THE VAST MAJORITY OF INTERVENTIONS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS TRAUMA. ARE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE. AND MY PERSONAL HISTORY I STARTED A CHARTER SCHOOL IN MY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD I GREW UP IN PHILLY. WITHOUT WORK FOR OPEN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS A THERAPIST I WAS A CRITICAL INCIDENT RESPONSE THERAPIST RESPONDING TO SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ACCESSIBLE VIOLENCE. BUT I WAS EMERGE FROM SOCIAL PRESSURES HOSPITAL OAKLAND. THAT I WHICH THE COUNTY WAS A CHILDREN'S HEALTH DIRECTOR EVENTUALLY THE HEALTH DIRECTOR. AND NOW I'M WORKING WITH SLAPPING AND SYSTEMS CHANGE AND I HEARD A LOT OF STUFF THAT REALLY EXCITED ME SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST AGAIN. AND THE THREE TAKEAWAYS FROM MY TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF. WORKING DIRECTLY LIVES OF CHILDREN IS THAT THERE'S BEAUTY IN INTELLIGENCE AND EVERY CHILD THAT'S THEIR BIRTHRIGHT. NOT SO WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FACING ON PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PROBLEMS. OTHER ACTUALLY THEIR BEAUTY AND THE TRANSCENDENCE. AND WITH SMART FINANCING AND RESPECT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO GREAT THINGS. SO I'LL TELL YOU HOW WE NEEDED IN BRAIDED AND BUBBLE GUM AND SHOESTRING SOME STUFF. BUT I COULD NOT AGREE MORE WITH SOME OF THE SPEAKERS EARLIER ABOUT THE NEED FOR A BROAD SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. AND AS ALL TALK ABOUT IN A SECOND THERE'S A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. THREE BILLION OF ON SPENT KNOW HOW FUNNY RIGHT TWO POINT TWO MILLION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. ANOTHER BILLION OF UNSPENT REALIGNMENT MONEY. AND FEDERAL WAIVERS THAT ORGANIZE OUR CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM BETTER TO FOR RENEGOTIATION AND TWENTY TWENTY. SO THE TIMING OF THIS HEARING IS EXTRAORDINARY AND HAS A CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL. SO WISE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SO IMPORTANT AND THE DATA TELLS US SO AND HER FROM TEACHERS AND PARENTS IN THE ROOM TODAY. SUICIDE IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE TWENTY FOUR. AND WHEN YOU LOOK THE THINGS THAT KILL KIDS AND REMEMBER THIS IS TAKEN FROM BIRTH AND DEATH RECORDS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY ROSE UP DIRECTORS AS IS OUR DATA. WE LOOK AT THE THREE THINGS THAT KILL YOUNG PEOPLE THEIR HOMICIDE SUICIDE AN INJURY. AND WHILE I LOVE MEDINA AND THE DOCTORS WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME. DOCTORS DON'T TREAT THESE THINGS RIGHT THERAPIST. AND SOCIAL NETWORKS TO SOME ORDER FOR US TO ADDRESS CHILDHOOD TRAUMA WE ACTUALLY. HAVE TO ACCESS THE PRIMARY CARE HOME BUT NOT DEPEND ON IT BECAUSE THERE IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH STOCKS. YOU COULD TAKE ALL OF THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS CURRENTLY IN TRAINING. AND THEY WOULD BE SWALLOWED BY KAISER ALONE. FORGET SUTTER FORGET MEDICAID RIGHT. SHE CAN'T DO IT WITH JUST A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT NEW WAYS NOW GO THROUGH A COUPLE. AND PARTICULARLY ADOLESCENTS HAVE THE LOWEST RATE OF PRIMERICA UTILIZATION OF ANY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP. SO ONCE YOU GET TO BE TEN OR TWELVE HE STOPS IN THE DOCK. SO IN ORDER FOR US TO TREAT YOUNG PEOPLE WE HAVE TO LOOK WHERE THEY ARE. AND THAT TENDS TO BE IN SCHOOLS RIGHT THAT'S THE BEST PLACE BUT ALSO ANOTHER CHILD SERVING SYSTEMS. AND WE ALSO KNOW MORE THAN WE DID AS YOU HEARD VERY COMPELLINGLY EARLIER WE HAVE NEW SCIENCE EMERGING PRACTICES IT'S NOT JUST ASUS RIGHTS ALSO BRAIN SCIENCE ITSELF. AND IF WE HAVE THE COURAGE WILL AND SKILL WE CAN APPLY THIS WORK THE LIVES OF CHILDREN BROADLY. AND I WITHOUT I THINK GOING TO HEART IT DHS AND OTHER PLACES OUR CHILDREN'S MONEY HOUSES TO MISS DRAMATICALLY UNDERPERFORMING AND IT'S NOT JUST OTHER NATIONS THAT AND THAT I NEED TO POINT OUT HERE. THERE ARE THREE STATES LEFT IN THE NATION THREE. THAT THE MINISTER MENTAL HEALTH THE WAY THAT WE DO IN CALIFORNIA. NORTH CAROLINA COLORADO AND CALIFORNIA. THREE OF ALL THE STATE'S CARVE MENTAL HEALTH OUT. AND MINISTRY AND ADMINISTERED COMPLETELY SEPARATELY. FROM THE REST OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEM JUST THREE OKAY. I GUESS PRIEST I IN FACT COLORADO NORTH CAROLINA ALREADY DOING INTEGRATION EFFORTS NOW LOOK I WAS AND I WAS A COUNTY HEALTH DIRECTOR SO THAT CARVE OUT OF THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVER. ESTABLISHES A IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED FREEDOM OF CHOICE WEBER BUT IT ESTABLISHES THE AUTHORITY FOR COUNTIES TO RUN THE MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS SEPARATE DISTINCT FROM MANAGED CARE PLANS. SO THAT MECHANICS AND STRUCTURE IS DO WHAT FOR NEGOTIATION AND TWENTY TWENTY. YOUR INTEREST COULDN'T BE MORE. EFFECTIVELY TIMES. AND OUR CURRENT SYSTEM MOST CHILDREN GET NO SUPPORT AND MANY GET THE WRONG KIND RIGHT THAT GET IT IN TO THE HALL OR IN CHILD WELFARE. AND NINETY SIX PERCENT OF ALL CHILDREN CALIFORNIA'S OF ANY TO CONGRATULATE THE LEGISLATORS IN THIS ROOM YOU HAVE DONE A UNIQUE THING WE BASICALLY HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR CHILDREN. NOT WHAT USING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE THAT POINT TRYING TO MAKE IS COVERAGE IS NOT EQUAL ACCESS. AS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT THE MECHANICS OF HOW CHILDREN ENTER CARE. NOT TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET IT NOT JUST THE HAVE A HEALTH BENEFITS MEMBER NINETY SIX PERCENT OF CHILDREN. ARE NOW COVERED BY HEALTH INSRANCE BENEFITS THAT INCLUDES A MENTAL HEALTH. PAIR. BUT LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF I GET A SERVICE ONE AND FOUR RECEIVE ANY KIND BUT THAT INCLUDE SPECIAL EDUCATION WHICH IS UNNECESSARILY RESPONSE TO TREATMENT. NEED. SO BOB BY GIVE YOU SOME TOUGH NUMBERS THERE IS HOPE. THERE ARE PROMISING PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA AND INTEGRATION IS POSSIBLE SO MINUTE FOR THE FOR THE TEACHER AMONG THAT GLOVES LISTENING YOUR QUESTION I COULDN'T HELP BUT. FEEL ANTICIPATION TO TELL THE STORY. BUT WE NEED A NEW FRAMEWORK WE CAN'T JUST DO WHAT WE'RE DOING. YEAH I I SAY SOME I SOMETIMES SAY WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE NICE CHRISTMAS TREE ORNAMENTS ON A DEAD TREE RIGHT LET'S LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE TREE AND WATER IT AND GOT RIGHT. SO YOUR CURRENT FRAGMENTATION THAT YOU ALL SPOKE TO IS THIS FEDERAL STATE DEVOLUTION TO COUNTIES. COUNTIES ARE THE PLACE WHERE THE STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS BECOME A SERVICE OR A CONTRACT FOR SERVICE. SORT FOR A THINK LEGISLATORS UNDERSTAND THIS IT REALLY ESSENTIAL. AND THE SYSTEMS LIKE A CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IS ADMINISTERED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. WITH STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT BECOME A CONTRACTOR SERVICE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THE SYSTEMS BE A CHILD WELFARE JUVENILE JUSTICE OR EDUCATION AND I SHOULD HAVE ADDED THE REGIONAL CENTER SO I'LL DO THAT NEXT TIME. THESE ARE FOUR DISTINCT SYSTEMS BUT ONE HOPE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT ALL I DID ADDED THANK YOU. THEY ALSO INCLUDE A MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS IF INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK OF HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE OVER THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CHO FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE THERE'SA REQUIREMENT FOR BEHAVE A LEVEL OF BEHAVIOR HOW SUPPORT. AND EVERY CHILD SERVING SYSTEM. EXCEPT NO ONE SAYS WHAT IT IS. IT JUST IT'S BRIGHT. SO IF WE HAD A NEW FRAMEWORK AND WE TO FIND WHAT IT WAS USING THE NEW SCIENCE OF BASIS AND BRAIN SCIENCE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO TRANSFORM THE ENTIRE CHILD SERVING SAFETY NET. IF WE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY LOOK AT CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH IN ANY WAY. SO WHILE THERE ARE THE TERRIBLE NUMBERS AT A SHOW YOU ABOUT THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE ARE ACCIONES KNOW HOW SYSTEM. IT LOOKED AT AS AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THE OBSTACLE IS THE WAY IT COULD BE A MOMENT. USING FEDERAL WAIVER OPPORTUNITY ON SPENT STATE DOLLARS TRANSFORM THE EXPENSE OF CHILDREN ARE SAFETY NET AND GET TO A BROAD SOCIAL MOVEMENT LIKE THE ONE WE HEARD ABOUT EARLIER. AND THAT HAS TO BE SAID WHO'S IN THE SYSTEM I WON'T GO THROUGH THESE YOU'VE HEARD THIS HORRIBLE DATA BEFORE. THESE ARE LARGELY POOR KIDS LARGELY POOR KIDS OF COLOR WHO ARE SUSPENDED REFERRED TO PROBATION OR IN FOSTER CARE. AND THESE HARSH REALITIES MEAN THAT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF YOUTH EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AFTER LEAVING FOSTER CARE. FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF YOUTH ARRESTED AFTER THE FOSTER CARE SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT OF YOU THAT YOU DON'T JUST SYSTEM ARE REARRESTED. AND WE RANK THIRTY NINTH AT SCHOOL SPENDING PER PUPIL AND THIRTIETH AND SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT. IN THE NATION. AND I NEED ALSO FEEL RESPONSIBLE AS A SOME IS DONE THIS WORK TO NAME THE REALITY OF STRUCTURAL RACISM IN THE STATE'S POSITION POVERTY. I'M SEVEN OUT OF TEN CHILDREN BORN INTO POVERTY NEVER GET OUT. SO THE EXAMPLES FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY THAT I WON A HIGHLY ARE HOW WE USE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS A WAY TO TRANSFORM THESE THREE SYSTEMS JUVENILE JUSTICE CHILD WELFARE EDUCATION AND I'M GONNA FOCUS ON EDUCATION. BUT JUST A COMIC QUICKLY IN OUR JOURNAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE OPENED UP A NEW JUVENILE HALL WE BUST FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT KIDS UP TO IT. SIX YEARS LATER AFTER DOUBLING THE MENA HOUSE STAFF AND. DURING A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION SERVICES THERE ARE SIXTY SEVEN KIDS IN OUR CURRENT JUVENILE JUSTICE CENTER SO FROM FOREIGNER NAY TO SIXTY SEVEN KIDS IN DETENTION. AND CHILD WELFARE DURING THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME WE WENT FROM FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED CHILDREN IN OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED TODAY. NOW THAT'S NOT JUST PAPER HEALTH BUT OF COURSE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WAS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THAT EXPERMENT. AND WE ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST PENETRATION RATE IN CHILD pEIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL CHILDREN AND COUNTY COUNTY CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM RECEIVED AMOUNT OF SERVICE. BUT IT'S EDUCATION WHERE WE HAD THE MOST SUCCESS AND IN THIS FIFTEEN YEAR PERIOD TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND I WAS WORKING ACCIONES OAKLAND US OF RANSOM SOCIAL WORKER AND SO WAS TREATING KIDS OF THAT FORTY EIGHT TWENTY FOUR. AND THEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OF THE HEALTH DIRECTOR I HAD BEEN FUNDING THE EXPANSION OF THE SERVICES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO GOT SERVICE GOT IT IN SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE KIDS ARE RIGHT. AND SO THAT CHALLENGE OF INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF POVERTY IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. A LOT OF MORE MORE POOR KIDS IN THE SAME PLACE THAT'S IT THAT'S IN MANY WAYS A NEGATIVE BUT IT'S ALSO A BENEFIT BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU CAN PAY FOR SERVICES FOR THEM UNDER MEDICAID. IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT. SO NINETEEN NINETY SIX THERE WERE FOUR SCHOOL HAS SCHOOL HEALTH CENTERS ALL STARTED BY DOCTOR BARBARA STAGGERS BY THE WAY OF A MENTOR OF MINE AND AND FROM CHáVEZ OAKLAND. AND BY CREATIVELY FINANCING THE BRICKS AND MORTAR WAS SCHOOL BONDS SOAP SCHOOL BONDS OF THE MOST POPULAR TAX IMAGE OF AMERICA THAT WAS PASSED. WE WENT FROM AND WE HOPE TO FIND THE NEXUS OF WHAT HEALTH A PUBLIC EDUCATION AGAIN WOULD YOU SCHOOL BONDS TO PAY FOR THE BRICKS AND MORTAR. FOR THE CLINICS WE USE MEDICAID TO PAY FOR EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE SERVICES THAT AN OPERATIONAL SUPPORTS AT THE SCHOOL CLINICS NEEDED. NEVER HAVE THAT AGAIN I DROP IT. BECAUSE SOME. FROM MEDICAID. ALL YOUR SERVICES ARE TIED TO DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA RIGHT AND A LOT OF THESE KIDS AS YOU HEARD EARLIER HAVE HAD BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM THEY'RE NOT PATHOLOGICAL. SO IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING THE NAME THAT A LOT OF KIDS ARE JUST POOR OR IT HAD BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM. THEY'RE NOT PATHOLOGICAL ARE NOT SICK. SO THE CHALLENGES OF THIS EXPANSION HAVE BEEN HOW TO BALANCE THE NEED TO GET SERVICES TO KIDS. WITH THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA REQUIRED TO GENERATE THE REVENUE TO PAY FOR IT AYE WITH ME. IT'S LIKE A CRITICAL ATTENTION IN THE FIELD. I AM SO WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT CLARA COMPETENCE TO WORK WITH SCHOOLS THE LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY HAS TO GET HUMBLE RIGHT IF YOU WALK INTO SCHOOL AND SAY HEY YOU'RE DOING A BAD JOB OF YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT. YOU KNOW. DOESN'T WORK. YOU HAVE TO USE MARK CROSS SECTORAL FINANCING STRATEGIES MEDICAID MEDICAID MEDICAID. HOW ABOUT MEDICAID RIGHT? AND THEN YOU HAVE TO LEARN A DOCUMENT AS WE HEARD EARLIER I'M AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF THIS WORK IS TO UNDERSTAND WHO GETS WHAT WHEN AND WHERE. SO WHAT IF WE REIMAGINE CHáVEZ PAPER HEALTH AND I'LL CLOSE WITH THE SLIDING ONE MORE THAT WHAT IF WE LOOKED AT IT DIFFERENTLY. USING THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY OF RIGHT NOW WHICH IS TONS OF ON SPENT STATE MONEY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACTED TWENTY LETTER REALIGNMENT IT'S OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A FAVOR OF INTERVENTION. WE ALSO KNOW THE TOOL FOR HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT THAT ALL CHILDREN THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THIS IS RIGHT SO ALL CHILDREN COULD BENEFIT FROM SUPPORT IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT FROM SOMEONE TO TALK TO WHO UNDERSTANDS THEIR NEEDS. WE DO KNOW THAT SOME NUMBR OF CHILDREN MEET CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA THERE ARE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL KIDS THEY NEED SERVICES WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW TO INTEGRATE THEM WITH TRADITIONAL HEALTHCARE PRACTICE. AND FINALLY IF YOU IF YOU GO WITH ME DESPITE THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF A HEALTH WE CAN CHANGE OUR SYSTEMS. SO MY FINAL SLIDE IS TO REPEAT THE WHY NOW WHY IS THERE SUCH AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT JUST INTERESTED IN AND THAT YOU GUYS ARE BRIAN THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME. BRICKS AND MORTAR. NUTS AND BOLTS CHANCE CHECK COUNT OUR OPPORTUNITIES IN FRONT OF US. THESE FEDERAL WAIVERS IN TWENTY TWENTY ARE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY WE CAN ENGAGE TEACH YES TO LOOK AT THE CARVE OUT THAT'S CALLED THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BEWARE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER WAVE COMING CALLED ELEVEN FIFTEEN HOSPITAL WHERE. THAT'S THE WAIVER THAT CURRENTLY FUNDS WHOLE PERSON CARE. PREVIOUSLY FUNDED THE LOCK OF HEALTH PROGRAM. THE CHANCE TO BRING IN SIGNIFICANT NEW FEDERAL REVENUE TO EXPERIMENT IN ARE A HEALTH SYSTEM. I THINK THAT WE COULD LOOK AT THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAVERING ELEVEN FIFTEEN VIEW ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER TOGETHER. AS A WAY TO REINVENT CHILDREN'S NOT HEALTH ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE ON SPENT AND STILL GROWING STATE REVENUE REMEMBER THOSE REAL. THE MENTAL SERVICES ACT AS A ONE PERCENT TAX ON MILLIONAIRES THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF MILLIONAIRES THEY'RE GROWING RIGHT IRAN MENTAL HEALTH RECEIPTS AND I RECEIVE THOSE DOLLARS AN ARMY COUNTY. AND ARGH RECEIPTS GREW TO FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BECOMING ONE OF THE LARGEST US SOURCES OF OF FUNDING FOR A BIT MOUTH APARTMENT. WE HAVE LEARNED LESSONS WE HAVE NEW SCIENCE WE SET UP THE COURAGE TO APPLY THEM. THERE ARE PROMISING PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA WHILE WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE GOOD CHRISTMAS TREE ORNAMENTS ON A DEAD TREE WE HAVE ENOUGH ORNAMENTS TO HANG ON HEALTHY TREE WHEN WE GET ONE. AND AS A NATIONAL MOVEMENT TOWARDS INTEGRATION AS I MENTIONED ONE OF THE FEW STATES LEFT THAT DOESN'T THIS OLD FASHIONED WAY. AND THERE'S NEW SCIENCE AND LEARNING FROM THAT'S STANDING. CATEGORY COLLEAGUES KEEP GOING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR MICHAELS. I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE SLICE. PUMP I'M DUTCH REALLY CYNICAL ASIDE A PEDIATRICIAN AND THE CEO OF THE CHILDREN'S CLINIC SERVING CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND I'M ALSO A CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS AT UC IRVINE I WORK IN LONG BEACH CALIFORNIA. WE ARE A SYSTEM OF ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND PATIENTS HALF OF WHOM ARE CHILDREN SO WE PRIDE TAKE CARE OF ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE LOW INCOME CHILD IN LONG BEACH AREA. TO TAKE CARE OF HALF OF THE HOMELESS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES EVEN THERE CALLED THE CHILDREN'S CLINIC WE DO ALL AGES. AND IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS YOU START TO DO PRENATAL CARE TO DELIVER SIX HUNDRED. BABIES A YEAR SO WE REALLY HAVE ACCESS TO IT ENTIRE SPECTRUM. ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO. ALL THE NEWS ABOUT A SAYS FINALLY HIT THE PEDIATRIC LITERATURE THINKS AND EIGHTEEN INJECTION COP AND OTHERS WE HAD OUR TOXIC STRATHCONA SEE STATEMENT. AND WE STARTED READING AND I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER CARING FOR THE UNDERSERVED BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES IN AFRICA. I DID CHILD ABUSE FOR TWO YEARS WHEN I FIRST. FINISH DATA COUNTY HOSPITAL. AND SO THIS IS BEEN MY PASSION FOR FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR A GRANT THAT WAS VERY SIZEABLE IT'S A LOCAL LA COUNTY GRANT FROM THE EVERY CHILD FOUNDATION. WE DECIDE TO FOCUS ON CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IN ADVERSITY AND FOCUS ON THE VERY YOUNGEST CHILDREN AND THE PRENATAL SO WE WENT AS UPSTREAM AS WE COULD AT THE TIME. AND. PUT IN A GRANT TO SCREEN AND. ADDRESSED THE ADVERSITY WITHIN OUR CLINIC WE HAVE A MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP SO EMPLOYERS THAT WORK WITH US WE HAVE INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS THROUGH A NATIONAL GRANT FOR OVER TEN YEARS LOOKING AT INTEGRATING THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH OUR CLINICAL SERVICES. SO WE REALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY WE ALSO FOR SCHOOL BASED CLINICS AND IT HAD MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF LONG BEACH OF THE CITY. HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND OUR OWN UNIVERSITY AND OUR. PHONE SCHOOL SYSTEM SO WE HAVE BEEN WERE REALLY POISED TO DO THIS I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DID FIRST WAS. EDUCATE OURSELVES FIRST WE EDUCATE OURSELVES FOR THE WHOLE YEAR NADINE TALKS ABOUT A PILE OF STUFF NEXT TO HER BED WHEN SHE WAS DOING THIS I HAVE EQUALLY. HIGH PILE IN BOXES ALL OVER MY OFFICE BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH LITERATURE COMING OUT SO QUICKLY. BUT WE. MATT AND GOT TO KNOW NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THEY WERE RUNNING COLLABORATIVE'S TO DO. TRUMP INFORMED CARE TRAINING FOR ORGANIZATIONS WE'RE THE FIRST TRUMPCARE CARE CERTIFIED ORGANIZATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WE TRAIN ALL TO AND FIFTY NOW WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STAFF WE TRAINED EVERYONE INTRO INFORMED CARE FIRST WHICH I THINK IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I NOW GET TO THE SCREENING YOU CANNOT DO THE SCREENING UNTIL YOU TRAIN PEOPLE IN WHAT THIS IS HOW TO APPROACH YOUR FAMILIES WITH DIGNITY AND KINDNESS AND CARING. AND NOT TO DEMONIZED THEM AND MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY'RE DAMAGED GOODS IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE LEARNED A LOT DURING THAT TRAINING I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT WHEN YOU DO THAT TRAINING AND WHEN YOU ROLL OUT THESE PRACTICES WITH IN YOUR ORGANIZATION. YOU WILL HAVE MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR ORGANIZATION WHO THEY THEMSELVES HAVE GONE THROUGH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BOTH NOW AND PERSON WE HAD MANY PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AFTERWARD AND SAID. I DIDN'T REALIZE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS DANGEROUS FOR MY CHILD AND THEY LEFT THEIR MARRIAGES THEY GOT INTO SAFE WE GAVE THEM REFERRALS. YOU HAD PEOPLE THAT STOOD IN WHEN WE HAD THE TRAINING I STILL SEE THEM THEY'RE STANDING IN THE BACK AND THERE ARE ONE OF MY LEADERS AND I THOUGHT THE REDUCE INTERESTED I WAS VERY UPSET. ONE THING IS YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO BE NON JUDGMENTAL SO THERE I WAS JUDGING THEM WHY ISN'T SHE INVOLVED. JUST YOU KNOW WE'D WE NOW KNOW THAT THOSE WERE PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T REALLY HEAR ABOUT THAT TO HEAR ABOUT THOSE THOSE ACES AND AND THAT ADVERSITY AND THE CHILD ABUSE AND THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE INCARCERATION. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WITH THEIR FAMILIES SO REALLY ASHER DOING THAT TRAINING YOU NEED TO BUILD A SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR YOUR OWN STAFF. IT'S LIKE PUTTING ON YOUR MAP OXYGEN MASK FIRST BEFORE YOU GIVE IT TO YOUR CHILD YOU HAVE TO DO THAT AND MAKE SURE YOU BILL THAT END AND THAT WAS ADVICE I GOT FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS TRAINING PRISON GUARDS AND TRUMP INFORMED CARE. IN HAWAII WHO I'D MET WITH BEFORE WE STARTED OUR PROGRAM SHE SAID PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS AND OF SO I REALLY WANT TO BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT THIS TRAINING. OF THE STAFF AND THE PEOPLE IN THE ORGANIZATION. SO THAT WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THE OTHER WAS CREATING. AN ADVISORY GROUP IT WAS EVERY CHILD MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER IN LONG BEACH THE CHIEF OF POLICE WHO IS IN OUR COUNTY SHERIFF CAME TO OUR MEETINGS. BODY LOWENTHAL IS STATE ASSEMBLY WOMAN WAS THERE HER STAFF WAS THERE THE LIBRARIAN WIECK CHD P. THAT. HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS WERE ALL SITTING AROUND THE TABLE AND THAT GROUP AFTER THE GRANT AND IT EVOLVED INTO THE TRUMP INFORM LONG BEACH. COMMITTEE WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO TRANSFORM THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF LONG BEACH INTO BEING A TROHMAN INFORMED AND RESILIENCY PROMOTING. PROCESS AND THEN WE GOT TO TO LOOKING WHAT'S WE HAD EVERYBODY TRAINED WE STARTED TO ROLL OUT. ROLLOUT THE. SCREENING TOOL WE'VE DEVELOPED A SCREEN TO THAT INTEGRATED MANY OTHER. VALIDATED TOOLS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO JUST LOOK AT ADVERSITY WE WANT TO LOOK AT STRENGTHS I'VE. YOU KNOW I'VE COME THROUGH THE STRENGTHS BASED APPROACH IN MY CAREER AND I REALLY BELIEVE IN THE STRENGTH AND RESPECT THE STRENGTH AND RESILIENCY OF OUR OUR PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE AND OUR STAFF. AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE PEOPLETHAT GO THROUGH EXTREME ADVERSITY ARE VERY STRONG AND VERY RESILIENT THEY NEED HELP BUT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE BLURRED THEY HAVE SURVIVED AND THEY'RE GETTING INTO YOUR OFFICE TO BRING THEIR CHILD IN. SO WE HAVE TO REALLY RESPECT THAT AND BUILD THAT INTO OUR PRACTICE. SO WE STARTED SCREENING I HAD AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WERE UNABLE TO ACTUALLY GIVE OUT THE SCREENING BECAUSE OF TOO CLOSE TO HOME FOR THEM WE HAVE TO RESPECT THAT AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. WE HAD DOCTORS THAT WERE UNCOMFORTABLE REVIEWING IT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY WERE FROM A CULTURE WHERE YOU JUST SUCK IT UP AND MOVE ON. AND THAT WAS VERY HARD FOR THEM BUT THEY STARTED GOING TO NATIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S WE WERE IN AND. THE STATE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IT WITH US AND THEY'VE REALLY INTEGRATED IT INTO THE TO THE CARE. WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE PLACES TO REFER TO I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT IS A POLICY ISSUE IS THESE ARE YOUNG CHILDREN THEY'RE ALL UNDER THE AGE OF FOUR. IS THAT IN LONG BEACH WE HAVE AS WE HAVE SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS UNDER THE AGE OF FOUR IN OUR PRACTICE ALONG ONE OF THE LIGHT WE ARE THE LARGEST PRACTICE IN IN LONG BEACH. THEY'RE TWO HUNDRED EARLY HEAD START PROGRAMS IN OUR COMMUNITY TWO HUNDRED. WE HAVE PROBABLY FOUR THOUSAND JUST IN OUR PRACTICE SO WE WOULD FIND FAMILIES THAT EARLY HEARTS HEADSTART IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IS A WONDERFUL PROGRAM THEY WORK. WITH THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD AND FOR ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS SUPPORTING THAT PARENT ITS INTERGENERATIONAL. I MEAN IT'S THIS TRAUMA IS INTER GENERATIONAL WHEN I WAS KIND OF TALKING TO MY WITH MY PATIENTS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY STARTED THE GRANT. I ALSO ABOUT THEIR CHILDHOOD VERY QUICKLY YOU KNOW WAS A NEAR WHAT WAS YOUR CHILDHOOD LIKE WAS THERE ANY ABUSE NEGLECT SEXUAL ABUSE ANY ALCOHOL ANYBODY PUT IN JAIL AND IN DEPRESSION IN YOUR FAMILY. WAS IT A LOVING FAMILY AND PEOPLE'S THEY'D FILL UP WITH TEARS IN THE SAID. YOU'RE THE FIRST DOCTOR THAT EVER ASKED ME THAT NOBODY EVER AFTER THAT BEFORE FOR GENERATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE. THE MOTHER THE OLDER HER OLDEST DAUGHTER FOR MOTHER AND HER GRANDMOTHER ALL SEXUALLY ABUSE I'VE THE FIRST PERSON I ASKED FOR THEM SHOULD A NEW BABY GIRL AND I SAID TO HER DO YOU WANT TO BREAK THE CYCLE. AND SHE SAID YES BUT SHE WASN'T SURE HOW SHE DO THAT WE REFERRED HER TO PLACES SHE CAME BACK LATER SHE ACTUALLY CAME TO OUR ADVISORY GROUP AND SPOKE UP. AND SHE'S NOW ACTUALLY UNEMPLOYED WITH THE CLINIC AND IS WORKING FOR US AND SHE'S DOING VERY WELL HER DAUGHTER IS STRUGGLING THE OLDER ONE. BUT I LINKED HER INTO THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER ALSO STATE FUNDED I DON'T IF YOU KNOW THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS BUT I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT GROUP TO LOOK AT. I BELIEVE THERE ARE TWELVE AND I THINK IT COMES FROM RESTITUTION FUNDS OR CRIMINAL. ANYWAY WHAT VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE HIM WITH A WONDERFUL. PSYCHOLOGISTS A DOCTOR BE TO GO FOR WHO WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH US AND SO WE PREFER CAN REFER THEM IN THERE ALL OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN TOWN BE. BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE EXPANSION GRANTS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT DO HAVE FUNDING FOR THE DYADIC CARE SO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT IT'S GETTING THEM THERE AND IT'S NOT RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST. THAT'S IMPORTANT WITH THE WITH THE PEDIATRICIANS MANY TIMES THE OTHER THING WE TRAINED EVERYONE IS IT WASN'T PERRY PART OF DEPRESSION. UMP POSTPARTUM OR PERRY PART OF DEPRESSION IS EXTREMELY COMMON SPOTTED TWENTY THIRTY PERCENT OF WOMEN HAVE THAT. WE HAVE A MATERNAL. ETERNAL HEALTH THERE'S A A GROUP IN LA COUNTY THAT JUST FOCUSES ON THAT AND THEY'VE TRAINED ALL OF OUR PHYSICIANS IN THAT. SO IN ADDITION TO THAT IN LONG BEACH THEY RECEIVE DOJ FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CREATE A SAFE LONG BEACH WE WERE INVITED IN TO BE THE TRAINERS AND WE'VE TRAINED ALMOST A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF LONG BEACH AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. I HAVE TRAINED. THE. HOME THE BALLPARKS IN RACKS THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. SCHOOLS OF MY STAFF DID A. THE OVERSIGHT FOR. DCS SOUTH AND THE RESPONSE IS QUITE AMAZING IT'S REALLY JUST CHANGING THE LANDS TEACHING PEOPLE NOT TO BE JUDGMENTAL AND ASKING. WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU OR WHAT IS HAPPENING TO YOU INSTEAD OF WHY YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR HOMEWORK Y. YOU CAN RELATE TO YOUR APPOINTMENT. WORLD WE ALL DO THAT AND IT'S THROUGH OUT EVERY SPECIALTIES I THINK ONE OF THE KEY POLICY ISSUES IS THE TRAINING. BUT ALSO THE TRAINING THE PEOPLE IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL CAREERS YOU CONTROLLED THIS STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND THE UC SYSTEMS I WANT YOU SEE A MEDICAL SCHOOL. NOBODY EVER TALKED ABOUT TRAUMA AND ADVERSELY PERSON WITH A LONG TIME AGO BUT I TRAIN RESIDENTS NOW FROM UC IRVINE MEDICAL. RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND WHEN I GIVE MY TALK TO THEM IN THE MORNING ABOUT. TRAUMA INFORMED CARE IN CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY ALMOST UNIVERSALLY NOBODY HAS HEARD OF IT. THERE IN THE UC SYSTEM MY FRIEND I THINK. WAS DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION OF CAL STATE LONG BEACH THE T. FOR TEACHERS AND SHE'S NOW HEAD OF THE STATE. UNIVERSITY. EDUCATION. DEPARTMENT. THEY GET NO TRAINING IN CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY OR TRAUMA IT'S A FAIR CHILDREN SO I REALLY THINK THAT'S A. VERY VERY. RIGHT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE WERE INTEGRATING THAT WOULD THERE'S YEARS AGO WE TALKED ABOUT HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES. AND NOW WE NEED TO HAVE A TRUMP INFORMED LANDS IT IN ALL POLICIES AND SEE IF WE CAN INTEGRATE THAT. THE SCREENING TOOLS. YOU KNOW I'M KIND OF BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND THEN AND NEIL AYE SCREENING TO ME IS A WAY TO OPEN UP A RELATIONSHIP IN A CONVERSATION SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO TRAIN PEOPLE TO PRESENTED AND TO RESPOND. IN A NON JUDGMENTAL WAY WE HAVE A WHOLE SCRIPT NO THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT WITH ME FOR SOME PEOPLE IT HAS TO BE TRUE A SCRIPT FOR OTHERS YOU CAN JUST. LEARN IT AND DO IT SINCERELY HAD SINCERELY BUT YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT WITH ME YOU'RE NOT ALONE. WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE HELP. AND AND THEN. YOU IF THEY SAY THEY DON'T WANT HELP NOW YOU A TO THEY COME IN THE NEXT TIME YOU ASK AGAIN AND YOU ESOS OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS WE SCREEN FOR. PSE SEVENTEEN FOR ANXIETY DEPRESSION THE HYPERACTIVITY FOR ALL OUR PATIENTS. WHEN ASKING FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION EVERY DELTA COMES IN GOT GET SCREEN FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT WE'RE UNIQUE LIKE NADINE WE GET A LOT OF GRANTS TO DO THIS. AND. WHERE FQHC SYSTEM? SO WE REALLY DO MUCH MORE THAN PEOPLE IN PRIVATE PRACTICE CAN DO. AND REALLY WHAT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE IS A CHECK OFF BOX YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE. SMOKING QUESTIONS ON THE SIEGE DP FORM AND IT'S NO NO YES EVERY JUST MARKS NO NO YES. AND NO NO YES MEANS THERE'S NO SMOKING NOBODY SMOKES IN THE HOUSE AND YES I COUNCIL BUT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY DO THAT. THEY CHECK OFF A BOX WE DO WE HAVE OUR FORMS FOR THE SCHOOL PHYSICALS IT SAYS DEVELOPMENTAL ASSESSMENT. BUT WE KNOW IN LA COUNTY THAT MOST OF THE PEDIATRICIANS AND FAMILY MEDICINE PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING DEVELOPMENTAL ASSESSMENTS WE ARE WE GOT TRAIN BY NEIL STAFF YEARS AGO THROUGH. THROUGH EACH ITEM A FIRST FIVE GRANT AND WE DO IT AND WE'VE INTEGRATE ALL THOSE THINGS YOU HAVE TO REALLY INTEGRATED INTO YOUR. TO YOUR PROCESS THERE'S A VERY GOOD GROUP OF FORMS I BROUGHT THIS IS MY NOTEBOOK OF ALL THE FORMS AND SCREENING TOOLS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CLINIC CAME. I BROUGHT IT WITH ME I COULD SHOW YOU. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PERSONALLY IS? THE STAYING HEALTHY FORUMS STAYING HEALTHY COMES OUT OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES IT IS REQUIRED BY EVERYONE WHO HAS MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE AND MEDI CAL SO WE GIVE IT OUT TO EVERYONE. AND IT HAS QUESTIONS BY AGE IN THE EARLY YEARS IT DOES NOT HAVE MATERNAL DEPRESSION IT DOES NOT HAVE VIOLENCE IN THE HOME IT DOES NOT HAVE HOUSING IN THE SECURITY OR FOOD INSECURITY. WE WE COULD ACT IN THE OLDER AGE AS THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF THAT AND IN THE ADULTS SO I THINK WE COULD ADD TO THAT AND YOURS YOUR COMMITTEE ON THAT I'M I WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU WITH THAT ALSO BECAUSE I FEEL SO STRONGLY OF BEEN. TRYING TO GET THEM TO CHANGE IT THERE'S A NEW VERSION COMING OUT WE CENTER OUR COMMENTS WE COULD ADD TO IT BUT I THINK TO SYSTEMATIZE THAT. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TO TRAIN PEOPLE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT SO THE STATE HEALTHY IT'S AN EXISTING TOOL OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES. THAT HAS SOME OF THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ASK ABOUT HOUSING AND FOOD INSECURITY IN ADDITION WE'VE STARTED TO DO THAT. WHEN WE DID OUR SCREENING WE HAD TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR FAMILIES AND HOUSING AND FOOD INSECURITY. IT'S VERY HARD TO BE A LEVINE GENTLE PARENT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE GOING TO BE LIVING AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GONNA FEATURE FAMILY. SO WE TRAIN TWENTY CAL FRESHEN ROLLERS IT WITHIN MY STAFF TO ENROLL PEOPLE IN THAT WE'RE STARTING FOOD PANTRIES AND WOOD LOOK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DOING AN APT TO DIRECT PEOPLE TO THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FOOD. I BEG YOU LOOK AT HOUSING WE HAVE US PROBABLY FIFTY PERCENT. FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF EVERYONE IN LONG BEACH IS RENT BIRD AND IT'S GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE EVEN MY OWN STAFF IT'S RENT SEVERELY RENT PRUDENT AND WE INCREASED OUR MINIMUM WAGE IN MY ORGANIZATION TWO YEARS AGO TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE IN THE CITY DID. SO WE REALLY TRY TO MOVE THINGS UP AS WE CAN. BUT HOUSING AND FOOD INSECURITY ARE HUGE AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO BE KIND AND LOVING. I THINK THE MORE WE CAN BILL PROTECTIVE FACTORS AMONG EVERYONE HAD THE MORE WE CAN ALL BE KIND AND NONJUDGMENTAL. THERE IS A LOT OF HEALING THAT CAN GO ON THROUGH THAT AND EVEN DOCTOR BEFORE WHO RUNS A TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER SHE SAYS MEANT MOST PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD SOME TRAUMA IN THEIR LIVES. THEY REALLY HEAL THROUGH THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AND PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITY. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION DR. WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NOT I'D LIKE TO OFFER A COMMENT I WAS. PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HOME MISTER BRISCOE'S. INVOLVING KIDS WHERE THEY'RE AT IN A SCHOOL BASED SYSTEM. AND WANTED TO KNOW IF THAT WAS A LOCAL APPROACH ARE HOW. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SCALE THAT TO SIZE. I HAD WANTED TO THINK ABOUT LAST YEAR LOOKING AT SCHOOL NURSES. THEN. SCHOOLS AND WONDER IF THERE'S A AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE ARE NOT CAPITALIZING ON THAT BY NOT. LOOKING AT SYSTEMS LIKE YOU PRESENT. SO YES AND AND I DON'T IT DROP DEEP INTO THAT POLICY READS AND DECISIONS A PASSED ELECTED BODIES BUT IT'S KINDA CRITICAL TO. PARSE OUT SOME OF THE DETAIL OF HOW GETS PAID FOR. AND TO START AS A PERSONAL STORY WHEN I STARTED WORKING ON THE CLIMBS HAS SCHOOL IN WEST OAKLAND AND TRUTH IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. THERE WERE TWO FULL TIME POLICE OFFICERS I HAVE TIME SCHOOL COUNSELOR AND NO SWIMMERS. AND I RIDE IS A SCHOOL THERAPISTS PAID FOR BY THE STATE AT THAT TIME. AND OUT RIGHT AFTER THAT IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS OF THE EP STT MENTAL HEALTH SETTLEMENT. WAS ANNOUNCED. BASICALLY THAT WAS A LAWSUIT ENGENDERED BY LEGAL AID THAT SAID PORTRAITS OF COLOR ARE NOT GETTING MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. AND IT CHANGED THE FEDERAL AND STATE MATCHING RATIO AND WHAT IT DID AT THAT TIME EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WAS IT SAID ANY COUNTY THAT PUT UP TEN CENTS. GOT NINETY CENTS OF STATE FEDERAL MATCH. FORTY CENTS FOR THE STATE FIFTY CENTS FOR THE FATS. IT'S REAL IMPORTANT NINETY TEN THAT. IN MY COUNTY A PREDECESSOR DAYCARES THE HEALTH DIRECTOR THE TIME. USE TOBACCO MONEY TO PUT UP TO TEN PERCENT. AND PULL DOWN NINETY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. FOR EVERY UNIT OF SERVICE TO START THE EXPANSION. THE STATE LEGISLATOR TWENTY IT'S LEGISLATURE DID SOMETHING IN TWENTY ELEVEN. DID HAPPEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN CALL TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. IT WAS A BLOCK GRANT TO COUNTIES. OF THE STATE SHARE. MEANING THAT COUNTIES NOW HAVE TO PROVIDE FIFTY CENTS INSTEAD OF TEN TO EXPAND OFF. SO TO ANSWER QUESTIONS RACKLEY IF YOU WANTED TO PUT UP A MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR IN EVERY SCHOOL. YOU ARE NOW ASKING COUNTIES TO PUT UP FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR SET OF TEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. YOU THE FEDERAL FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR IS A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT MEANING THE FEDS CAN'T SAY NO. RIGHT SUFFER EVERY TIME YOU PUT A FIFTY CENT YOU GET A FEDERAL MATCH AFFECT MP A FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. EVERYTIME SO TO DO WHAT YOU SUGGEST. YOU HAVE TO DEPEND TO SOME OF THAT THREE BILLION OF UNSPENT MONEY. SEND IT DOWN TO COUNTIES. WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT BUT SUCH WORK IN EVERY SCHOOL. HOW THAT MATCH WITH STATE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO W. MONEY? SO THE LONG AND SHORT OF YOUR QUESTION YES THERE IS A MECHANISM BUT IT WOULD TAKE STATE LEADERSHIP. STATE RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES TO PULL DOWN THE FEDERAL MATCH YOU WITH ME. IT'S A CINCH UNDERSTAND THAT THE COUNTIES MAKE THE FEDERAL MONEY COME NOT THE STATE. THE STATE PROVIDES THE NON FEDERAL SHARE. BUT THE ACT THE ACT OF EXECUTION THE MECHANICS OF MATCHING IT. HAPPENS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND THE CAPACITY OF COUNTIES. ARE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT. SOME COUNTIES A REALLY GOOD POINT ON THAT FEDERAL MATCH WE HAPPEN TO BE GOOD AT IT NOW ME COUNTY. AT GREAT. PREDECESSORS MANY COUNTIES ARE VERY POOR AT IT. SO THE CHALLENGES AND JUST THE STATE SAYING SO IT'S NOT JUST STATE SAYING SO IN GIVING THE MONEY IT'S A STATE SAYING SO GIVEN THE MONEY AND PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO EXECUTE. AS LONG WINDED BUT I HOPE. THAT WAS AN ANSWER NO I. I THINK YOUR ANSWER. A HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE AS A STATE. THAT OFTENTIMES. A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH DOESN'T WORK FOR. AND EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY WHICH IS ATTEMPTING TO PULL DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS AND THE WAY THAT YOU BRING FOR. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE SERVE IN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. WHICH MEANS WE SPEND PART OF OUR TIME. CONVINCING IN EDUCATING OUR COLLEAGUES ON WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS TO MOVE POLICIES FORWARD AND. I'M IS WHY I'M SO EXCITED FOR TODAY'S TOPIC AND. THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT IS. UP. HIGHLIGHTING WHAT HAS WORKED IN CERTAIN AREAS AND COMMUNITIES AND LOOKING AT IT AS AN EXAMPLE THAT WE AS A STATE COULD LOOK TO REPLICATE OR SCALE YEAH EXERCISE. IF IT IS NOT GOING COVER THE DOCTOR HOW OFTEN MADE THAT PUTS. THAT SO SENSUAL. JUST BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO DO SOME STUFF AND ALAMEDA COUNTY I DON'T AT ALL SUGGEST THAT THE STORY I TOLD YOU IS THE ANSWER. WHAT UCLA'S DOINGS ANSWER? BUNDLED VALUE BASED PAYMENT WITH A NEW MECHANISM BUT LITERALLY YA WE NEED TO BREAK IT DOWN START HOPE FOR RIGHT THERE'S IT A REINVENTION OF HOW WE DO BEHAVE OUR HOUSE IS ESSENTIAL IN THE STATE. AND THE COUNTIES ON OPTICAL WAY THERE'S A ROLE FOR THEM TO. BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT REINVENTING RESTRUCTURING IT FUNDAMENTALLY IN IN THE CONTEXT OF A BROAD SOCIAL MOVEMENT. SO THE DOCTORS WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME THEY HAD IT RIGHT. AND JUST AS I TOLD YOUR STORY ABOUT HOW WE DID IT IN ONE PLACE WITH SOME SOPHISTICATED RESOURCES AND DOLLARS I DON'T WANT THAT TO COME OFF AS THE SOLUTION. THAT WAS A WAY OF MITIGATING HARM. THE SOLUTION IS A MUCH BROADER ONE. AND HAVE TO INCLUDE GHS AND IT HAS TO INCLUDE COUNTIES. WITH THAT. WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL FOR COMING FORWARD AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL. TO DISCUSS SOLUTIONS MIA I IT JUST TWENTY I PUT IN. FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE THE CHANGING MINDS PREVENT TEEN AND HEALING CHILDHOOD TRAUMA STATE POLICY GUY. ITS STAPLE TO SOMETHING ELSE IN YOUR PACKET SO. GOT IT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR. FIRST WE WILL HAVE DOCTOR COFFER. BY PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY FOLLOWED BY JOHN POWDERS FRANK MECCA AND DONNA SNEERING REALLY THRILLED TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT TRAUMA AND BE PART OF THE SOLUTIONS WE'VE HEARD SOME PRELIMINARY SOLUTIONS ALREADY. ON BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE TO STILL ADD TO THE CONVERSATION AND IN PARTICULAR I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE'VE HAD SO MANY PANELISTS WHO COME UP AND TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE SCIENCE. ARMIN TALKED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL TRAUMA BEAT BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT I THINK THAT WE STILL NEED TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION. AND SO. THAT IS THE CHARM HAS TO BE A PRIORITY. AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE WORD I HAVEN'T HEARD. UTTERED AT LEAST ENOUGH TODAY TO TALK ABOUT TOXIC STRESS WE TALKED ABOUT TRAUMA BUT WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT SAFETY. AND HAVE A TALK ABOUT SAFETY AS BEING ONE OF THE QUARRY NEEDS THAT WE HAVE A WE THINK OF MASSLIVE HIERARCHY OF NEEDS SAFETY IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH WHAT WE NEED. AND SO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER EMOTIONAL SAFETY IN OUR POLICY PRIORITIES. AND AND AS HAS BEEN ALREADY ARTICULATED YOU KNOW THIS IS A RISK FACTOR FOR BEHAVIORAL FOR PHYSICAL AND FOR MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND FRAME IT FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE AND HOW DO WE RESTORE SAFETY BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT THE BRAIN AND WITH THE BODY IS DOING IS IT'S WAY OF TRYING TO RE ESTABLISH SAFETY. IT'S JUST I JUST HAPPENS TO BE MALADAPTIVE. SO. OPPORTUNITY NUMBER ONE IS IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION AND THIS IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT. INCOME TO DANCE AROUND A LITTLE BIT DOWN IN TERMS OF WHAT WE MAY NEED BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS A RETROSPECTIVE SELF REPORT DATA ON ADULTS. SO THE ASUS STUDY THAT WAS INITIALLY DONE WAS THAT WAS IN ADULTS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA ON THAT AND THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF CLINICAL DATA AND A LOT OF RESEARCH ON CHILDREN. BUT WHAT WE NEED IN A MORE SYSTEMATIC WAY IS POPULATION BASED DATA ON CHILDREN SO NODDED POCKETS NOT PER CORRECT PROGRESSIVE CITIES THAT DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING% TO SCREEN AT CERTAIN AGES WE ACTUALLY TO DO THIS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AND HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IT AND THE EXAMPLE THAT I WOULD USE FOR WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IS THAT WE THINK ABOUT INFANT MORTALITY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THAT IS THAT EVERY STATE HAS PREMIUMS OR IN CALIFORNIA'S CASE THE MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH ASSESSMENT. AND THAT ALLOWED US TO BE ABLE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE AND GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN FOR MORTALITY WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN MARKED DECREASES IN INFANT MORTALITY BECAUSE WE HAD. THAT ROBUST POPULATION BASED DATA SET AS WELL AS ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON IN TERMS OF A PAY CONCRETE NEXT STEP. THE NEXT IS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT EXPANDED ACES AND SO WE TALK ABOUT THESE MEASURES OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD THE COLLECTIVE ABUSE AND DYSFUNCTION BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE CAUSING TRY. LIKE FOSTER CARE SO WE KNOW THAT POVERTY IS ARGUMENT WE TALKED LA FOSTER CARE BEING IN FOSTER CARE IS THE TRAUMA. I'M HAVING A PARENTAL DEATH IS A TRAUMA IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE EIGHTH THE STUDY ON DISCIPLINE AND INCARCERATION OF YOURSELF NOT YOUR PARENT ALSO IS NOT INCLUDED IN ACES AND SO WE NEED ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT. WHAT ARE THE OTHER TRAUMAS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THOSE COURT TEN THAT ARE PREVALENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT ARE IMPACTING HEALTH OUTCOMES? AND THEN THE LAST ONE IN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE A LOT OF CREDIT TO HOWARD PINTER HUGHES AT UCSF AND MY SHOULD JACKSON FOR FOR TALKING ABOUT ADVANCING ITS ADVERSE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE AS. SO ALSO EXISTS AND THESE ARE THINGS LIKE RACISM AND VIOLENCE AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NOT OF NOT NOT ONLY HAPPENING AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL BUT ARE ALSO HAPPENING AT A COMMUNITY LEVEL BUT EVERYONE IS EXPERIENCING. AND MUCH LIKE. LIKE YOU TO USE VIOLENT EXAMPLES MUCH LIKE A BOMB THAT HAS SORT OF AT THE CENTER AND THEN IT RICOCHETS OUT THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR ADVERSE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES BUT THERE IS A HEAT POINT WHERE. IT DIDN'T IMPACT THE FAMILY IF THERE'S A SHOOTING OR IF THEY'RE IF I'M SOME SORT OF VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENED THERE BUT IT ALSO ECHOES OUT INTO THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS WEL. THE SECOND AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS TRAINING IN SCHOOLS AND SO I HAVE BEEN I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ON THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT ABOUT TRAUMA AND MUCH LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE SUGGESTED THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NEW. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY THEY. FREQUENTLY WALK AWAY WITH IF THIS IDEA OF WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NEXT AND I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU GAVE ME SOME CONCRETE EXAMPLES IN CONCRETE NEXT STEPS. SO ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THOUGH IS THAT WHEN WE NEED TO CHANGE THE FRAME AWAY FROM BAD KIDS. BECAUSE WE THINK OF OF CHILDREN AS BEING BAD WE THINK OF THEM AS BEING INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC WE WE COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE FRAME THAT WE COME UP WHAT WE THINK ABOUT CHILDREN BEING TRAUMATIZED. WE THINK ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOR AS A WAY TO RESTORE SAFETY WE SEE IT DIFFERENTLY AND WE RESPOND DIFFERENTLY IF WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN INSTITUTIONALIZE TRAINING FOR ADMINISTRATORS FOR TEACHERS AND FOR STAFF ON ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AN ADVERSE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES. AND SO THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY DOING A LOT OF THIS WORK FEATURES WITH PILOT WITH WITHOUT VIOLENCE HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. ACES CONNECTION OF THE NUMBER ONE THEIR LOCAL CHAPTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY'RE DOING SOME OF THIS WORK AND THE TRAINING NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY TRAUMA INCLUDING RACISM VIEWS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER. AS A CSUS. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST WANTED TO TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY OR SOME OF WHAT THOSE CONCRETE NEXT ABSOLUTE BOOK LIKE FOR SCHOOLS. I'M A BIG ONE IS RESTORATIVE DISCIPLINE HAVE ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE OFTEN RE TRAUMATIZED STUDENTS IS IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE DISCIPLINE THEM FOR THE BEHAVIORS THAT ARE ACTUALLY SYMPTOMS OF TRAUMA. AND SO WE NEED TO BEGIN TO REALLY TO RETHINK RESTORE WRIST RETHINK OUR DISCIPLINE AND MAKE IT RESTORATIVE AND THIS IS MODEL THE DESIRED BEHAVIOR REPAIRING HARM. TEACHING LESSONS HAVING PROPORTIONAL AND RESPONSIVE. DISCIPLINE FOR FOR BEHAVIOR THINK BEHAVIORS BETTER INAPPROPRIATE HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED IN A WAY THAT'S DRAMATIC. IN THE CAN BE MUTUALLY AGREED UPON SO THERE'S SORT OF THIS CONTINUUM OF PUNITIVE TO PERMISSIVE AND IT OFTEN. CIRCUMVENTS THE RESTORATIVE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE UPPER RIGHT QUADRANT EVERYTHING ABOUT BEING RESTORATIVE. THE NEXT IN THIS IS BEEN IMPORTANT IS MENTORSHIPS TO RESTORE SAFETY AHMED SO. AT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE WITHIN SCHOOLS THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS WHO MAY BE IN FOSTER CARE OR ME. HAVE TRANSIENT LIVING SITUATIONS WHERE A LOT OF THEIR COMMUNITY CONSTANTLY SHIFTING AND SO HAVING AN ESTABLISHMENT OR HAVING SOMEONE YOU CAN CALL WHEN THAT CHILD IS HAVING A BAD DAY. AND BE ABLE TO HAVE BEEN RESTORED SAFETY OF INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN THE OTHER ONE THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED I REALLY THINK THE PANELISTS FOR FOR BRINGING THAT UP IS HAVING RESOURCES TO MEET BASIC NEEDS WE KNOW THERE'S FOOD INSECURITY WHEN WE KNOW WE HAVE A HIGH. HOMELESSNESS AND ISSUE IN THE STATE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE RESPONSIVE TO THAT IN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE BACK BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP. AND OFTEN IN OUR YOUNGEST KID THAT HAS BEEN-MENTIONED THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS ARE GOING ON TO BE DISPLAYED IN WAYS THAT WE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND OR MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE AS BEING LINKED TO TRAUMA BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK ABOUT. AS BEING TRAUMA SYMPTOMS. AND THEN MEMBER THREE AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS HOW WE RESPOND TO OUR PREVENT COMMUNITY TRAUMA. AND SO. AS PUBLIC OF ADVOCATES WE HAVE BEEN A. A PROGRAM CALLED THE HEALTHY EATING ACTIVE LIVING CITIES CAMPAIGN AND IT'S IN A HUNDRED NINETY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT FOCUSES ON HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING BUT WE THINK THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THIS MODEL. AND AND TO BE ABLE TO ALSO FOCUS ON TRAUMA AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE WHEN THERE ARE TRAUMAS THAT HAPPEN AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL IS THAT THE CITY LEADERSHIP NEEDS TRAINING ON HOW TO HOW TO APPROPRIATELY RESPOND. BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO MERGE THE MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE WE HAVE ALL THESE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS THAT ARE DIVIDE TO RESPOND TO YOU KNOW HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES AND ALL THAT THAT THE THINGS BUT WHEN THERE'S A TRAUMA IN THE COMMUNITY WE NEEDED EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM THAT'S GOING TO RESPOND. TO THAT AS WELL AND BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING AGAIN ADDRESS THAT AT THE CENTER AND WHAT RICOCHETS OUTWARD FROM. WE NEED COMMUNITY HEALING EVENTS RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO ACTION ON FRIDAY THERE WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALING OF BAD THAT WAS SPONSORED IN THE WITH IN RESPONSE TO THE STEFAN CLARK CLARK SHOOTING AND THAT WAS DONE BY SOUTH SACRAMENTO CHRISTIAN CENTER AND. THAT IS SACRAMENTO KINGS ORGANIZATION AND SEVERAL OTHERS BUT THAT SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO GOOD AND YOU KNOW WELL MEANING CITIZENS THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S INSTITUTIONALIZED AS PART OF THAT WAS. AND SO THAT THAT GOES ALONG TO THE RESPONSE PROTOCOLS OF HOW DO WE FRAME THE ISSUES HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THEM IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY THAT DOESN'T TRAUMATIZE. COMMUNITIES IN THE AFTERMATH OF. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THEN WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS ON RESILIENCE AND SO MANY OF THE PANELISTS WHO COME BEFORE ME HAVE TALKED ABOUT. THE ASUS SERVIAN HOW IT HAS THESE TEN QUESTIONS ON IT THAT MEASURE ABUSE NEGLECT AND HOUSEHOLD DYSFUNCTION BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IS THERE'S ALSO A A RESILIENT SURVEY THAT TALKS ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE DO THESE TRAINING. THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY WHO INEVITABLY COMES UP TO YOU AFTER THAT THAT I WAS REALLY WORRIED WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT ALL YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE. ACES ARE A THOUSAND TIMES MORE LIKELY TO PASS THEM ON TO THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT YOU KNOW THEY THAT THERE'S THIS INCREASE IN HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES AND SMOKING AND ALL THESE THINGS. AND THEN I REALIZED THAT MY RESILIENT SCORE WAS FOURTEEN AT FOURTEEN AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY AND HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED SOME OF THE THINGS THAT'S WHY I MADE MY BRAIN HAD SOME PLASTICITY AND WAS ABLE TO DO SO MADERA PRUNING IN THE RIGHT WAY FOR THE GRAIN RIGHT MATTER. TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW ME TO COPE WITH TO ADAPT I HAD PEOPLE IN MY LIFE WHO BELIEVED IN ME MY COMMUNITY HAD GOAL THERE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING THAT WERE RESILIENT. IF WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE THEN EXPAND THOSE FROM INDIVIDUAL RESILIENCE FACTORS TO BEING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE FACTORS AND SO WE ARE PROGRAMS LIKE THE ADVANCE PEACE PROGRAM WHICH OF THE DRESSING COMMUNITY VIOLENCE. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE EXPAND THOSE WE HAVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS SO IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS COMMUNITIES THAT THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HIGH LEVELS. OF UNEMPLOYMENT WE NEED TO GO HOW DO THEY DO WE ADDRESS THOSE AND NOT THINK ABOUT IT JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF YOU KNOW THE TYPICAL OUTCOMES BUT HOW THEN DOES THAT ALSO AFFECT THE RESILIENCE WHEN THERE IS A COMMUNITY TRAUMA. WE NEED TO THINK BY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN THE SAME WAY AND HOW THAT ALLOWS COMMUNITIES TO CONNECT IT TO BE MOBILE AND THEN HOW THAT ALSO ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONNECTION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND MAKING SURE THE COMMUNITIES ARE ENGAGED IN PRIORITY SETTING ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT INTO RESTORING SAFETY IS THAT MANY TIMES THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED THEY FEEL LIKE THE TROUBLE WITH OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. AND SO WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN THE COMPANIES COMMUNITY TRAUMA THEM THAT'S ALSO OUT OF THEIR CONTROL THERE'S THE SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS THAT BACK NAM TAKES HOLD AND SO REALLY MAKING SURE THAT EVEN IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE ENGAGE IN SETTING POLICY PRIORITIES. IS COMMUNITY BASED IN IS INCLUDING PEOPLE SO THAT WERE NOT TRAUMATIZING THEM IN THAT WAY AND THEN OF COURSE MAKING SURE THAT OUR SAFETY POLICY THERE AGAIN NOT DRAMATIZING. AND SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN. YOU KNOW I'D SHOW THEM EXAMPLES HERE OF SOME OF THE COMMUNITY TRAUMAS OF HAVING INTERIOR ENFORCEMENT FOR AYE EASE OF A YOU KNOW SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ONE OF THE GOOD ONE EXAMPLE THE BAT IS. A SAFETY PROTOCOL FOR THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IS TO DO THESE DRILLS THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT HOW DOING SAFETY DRILLS FOR SCHOOL SHOOTINGS DRAMATIZES MANY CHILDREN. AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE BALANCE THE NEED FOR PREPARATION WITH ALSO THE NEED FOR SAFETY. THANK YOU SO. ALLOW MY OTHER PANEL. RIGHT. YOU VERY MUCH WELL SHE KINDA GIVE MY SPEECH. BUT THAT'S OKAY THOUGH THAT THAT'S A GOOD DREAM THERE'S A LOT OF AGREEMENT AS A LOT OF HEADS NODDING I KIND OF FELT LIKE I COULD CHECK OUT MY BOXES OF. MY NAME'S JOHN VOTERS AND THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT CALIFORNIANS PERCEIVED INJUSTICE AND AYE AYE ONE ACTUALLY JUST TAKE A HALF STEP I APPRECIATE THE NARRATIVE ON SAFETY BECAUSE. THAT'S THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE I'M HOPING TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AS WELL. AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO I WAS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY. AND. I HAD A CLIENT COME TO ME AND SHE I WAS REPRESENTING HER IN A MATTER. ARE RELATED TO HER BROTHER ACTUALLY SHE WAS BEING EVICTED BECAUSE OF HER BROTHERS A CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. INCHES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A HAVE ASK OF YOU AND I SAID YES YES I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY ABOUT MY SON. AND SHOULD A SIX YEAR OLD SON AND. HER SIX YEAR OLD SON GOT UP ON SATURDAY MORNING HAD HIS PAJAMAS I GOT A BOWL OF CEREAL AND SEAN WENT DOWN TO WATCH CARTOONS LIKE ANY OTHER KID SHOULD DO ON A SATURDAY MORNING. AND HER MIND HIS MOM HAD INVITED HER BROTHER WHO WAS RECENTLY AT A PRISON INTO THE HOME TO STAY BECAUSE HE HAD NO PLACE TO GO. AND UP THE LAST THREE WEEKS AFTER I GOT OUT OF PRISON HE HAD BEEN GAUGING HIS OLD WAYS AND OUR A SWAT TEAM FROM CHICAGO PD. CAME IN AT SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING. TO ARREST. JON'S UNCLE AND HE WATCHED TWELVE OFFICERS TAKE HIS OWN CLOUT HAIRCUTS HE CAN UNDERSTAND SINGLE THING OF IT. AND MONDAY MORNING HE WENT TO SCHOOL. ANNA SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER PSALM IN THE HALLWAY AND SAID. DO YOU HAVE YOUR LUNCH MONEY. PROBABLY BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO OFFER HIM MONEY IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT. THE WEB ITSELF IN THE HALLWAY. AND SO THE IMPACT THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. HAS ON ACES IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT I'M GONNA TRY TO NARROW MY CONVERSATION DOWN TO BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE EXTREMELY REPETITIVE OTHERWISE OF ALL THE GOOD PEOPLE BEFORE ME. BUT CALIFORNIANS RECEIVED INJUSTICE IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ORGANIZATION THAT'S FOCUSED ON LIFTING UP THE VOICES OF CRIME SURVIVORS THAT INCLUDES CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA. AND WE HAVE BEEN. LEADERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ON THE ISSUE OF ACES IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY SPACE FOR AWHILE NOW. WE WORKED ON PROP FORTY SEVEN IN ORDER TO HELP MAKE TEN PERCENT OF THE STATE SAVINGS FROM PROP FORTY SEVEN AVAILABLE TO TRAUMA SURVIVORS IN TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS. I'M WE HELP PASS A DOCTOR WEBER IS BILL TO CREATE THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS. WE WORKED WITH THE CHAIR HERE LAST YEAR ON AB THREE FORTY WHICH I'M WILL INCREASE SCREENINGS FOR KIDS WHO EXPERIENCED TRAUMA AND MEDICAL PROGRAMS. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO EARLY. IDENTIFICATION OF TRAUMA. AND WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THAT PIPELINE BACK FROM THE PRISON TO FIGURE OUT WHY DO WE HAVE SO MANY FOSTER INVOLVED YOUTH WIDE WE HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN FROM MINORITY LOW INCOME. YOU NO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN PRISON WHY ARE SO MANY WOMEN WHO ARE IN PRISON IN CALIFORNIA THESE DAYS VICTIMS OF SEXUAL AND VIOLENT ABUSE IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE. AND THE REALITIES THAT. A LOT OF THE THINGS WE FOUND CAN BE DEALT WITH IN A PLACE THAT WOULDN'T THINK WE'D FIND IT PROBABLY THE SCHOOL. AND SO OUR INTEREST IN THIS HEARING WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE CHAIRS FOR CONVENING IT IS THAT WE ACTUALLY THINK THE SCHOOL PROVIDES ONE OF THE NEXT STEPS BEYOND FROM RECOVERY CENTERS FOR ADULTS AND. HEALTH SCREENINGS FOR KIDS THAT THE SCHOOLS ACTUALLY A TOTALLY ADEQUATE PLACE AN APPROPRIATE PLACE. A PLACE WHERE CHILDREN SPEND MOST OF THEIR DAY WHEN THEY'RE NOT AT HOME. TO ACTUALLY SCREEN IDENTIFYING TREAT CHILDREN FOR TRAUMAS. A LARGE NUMBER OF TRAUMA SURVIVORS AS I MENTIONED ARE ALL JUSTICE INVOLVED IN AS WE LIKE TO SAY I'M HURT PEOPLE. HURT PEOPLE. AND SO IF WE ARE GOING TO LOOK SERIOUSLY AT HOW WE TREAT TRAUMA IN KIDS. IT WITH WE ARE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND I APPRECIATE THE SAFETY NARRATIVE BEING KICKED OFF AHEAD OF ME. OUT IF WE IF WE REALLY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT SAFETY WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AND REALIZE IT'S. IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT OFF OF THOSE NEUROLOGICAL MECHANISMS DOCTOR. NADINE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER RELATED TO THAT FIGHT OR FLIGHT INSTINCT. ITS OF IMPLICATIONS TODAY ARE SERIOUS A CHILD WHO IS A VICTIM OF TRAUMA. THE GOES UNDETECTED IN UNTREATED IS LABELED TRUANT TODAY THEIR LABEL ANTISOCIAL MAXED. THEN THERE ARE DELINQUENT THEN THE SCHOOL DECIDES THAT THEY SHOULD BE. DISCIPLINED AND WITHHELD FROM RECESS THAT BECOMES A SUSPENSION. THEN THAT'S AN EXPULSION WHEN THEY TURN EIGHTEEN WE SEE DIFFERENT THINGS WE CALL THEM A CRIMINAL WE CALL THEM A FELON. WE CALL THEM A RECIDIVIST. IN CALIFORNIA THERE FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND. CIVIL STATUTE PENALTIES THAT PROHIBIT A PERSON WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD FROM ENGAGING IN NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITY. YOU CAN'T BECOME A BARBER IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD YOU CAN'T BECOME A COSMETOLOGIST. YOU CAN'T BE A NURSE YOU CAN'T CARE FOR IT AS A BEEN ADOPTED PARENT FOR ONE OF YOUR. YOUR YOUR NIECES OR NEPHEWS IF THE PARENTAL. HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD DIES OR IS OTHERWISE INCARCERATED WE HAVE CREATED A SYSTEM WHERE HURT PEOPLE WILL HURT PEOPLE. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERVENTION AND WE'D BE VERY HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FURTHER ABOUT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN SAID ALREADY. BUT ONE OF THE ONES THAT WE WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IS WE WANT TO BREAK THE INTERGENERATIONAL NATURE OF. TRAUMA AMONG CHILDREN IN THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS EARLY I MEAN DOCTOR ETIENNE'S FIRST SLIDE WAS THE BEST SLIDE OF THE DAY. YOU KNOW A THREE YEAR OLD CHILD WHOSE GROWTH TRAJECTORY IS ALTERED. BY HAVING ACES AT THE AGE OF THREE. AND SO HOW DO WE DO THAT IN THE SCHOOLS WILL BE FOR A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT. THAT YOU KNOW THE STATE IS SILO DIDN'T STRUCTURE THAT'S VERY TRUE AND NOT YOU KNOW MEMBER MATHIS WAS SPEAKING EARLIER ABOUT HAVING TO. IDENTIFYING WORK WITH A WHOLE TON OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I THINK. ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW THE TRUMP RECOVERY CENTER MODELED DOES. THERE'S A POINT PERSON EVERY TIME YOU COMMAND IF YOU'RE CRIME SURVIVOR EVERYTIME YOU COME IN THE SAME PERSON. WHO WHO MET YOU THE FIRST DAYS THE PERSON WHO MEETS YOU EVERYTIME YOU COMMAND YOU TO COMPLEMENT OF STAFF TO ASSIST YOU WITH YOUR NEEDS AS YOU GO THROUGH? COUNSELING OR THERAPY ON BUT YOU HAVE A SINGLE SOURCE. FOR CONTACT TO YOUR WHOLE PERSON CARE. AND IN THE SCHOOL SETTING THE SCHOOL REALLY ACTUALLY SERVES ALMOST AS ITS OWN LITTLE. IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE WHITE BLOOD CELL OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THE SCHOOL ITSELF THE CHILDREN ARE THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS. AND IF YOU ACTUALLY CREATE A SYSTEM SIMILAR TO WHAT THE SAN FRANCISCO. ARMED UCSF HEARTS SYSTEM DOES RIGHT SO THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A MODEL. ON IN SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY'RE UP THERE. SEVEN TO TEN SCHOOLS THAT THEY'RE SERVING ON WHERE THEY ACTUALLY GO IN AND THEY CREATE ENTIRE RESILIENCY IN THE SCHOOL SO THEY'VE. ADMINISTRATORS TEACHERS STAFF AND THE STUDENTS ARE ALL TRAINED IN TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES AND SO THEY ALL ACT IN THE THAT BEN BODIES RESTORATIVE JUSTICE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IN THE COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE WHEN ONE CHILD HURTS ANOTHER CHILD RIGHT THAT THE CHART THE CHILDREN OUR POSITION TO LEARN HOW TO FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER LEARN HOW TO REPAIR RELATIONSHIPS HOW TO MAKE THAT COMMUNITY HOLE AGAIN. BUT WHEN CHILDREN EXPERIENCE ACES ELSEWHERE IN THE COMMUNITY AND BRING THEM TO SCHOOL WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE TEACHERS WHO UNDERSTAND. AND TRACK ARE AND ARE TRAINED IN PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE TRAINED TO BE PART OF A SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT KEEPS THAT CHILD IN SCHOOL EVERY MINUTE AND EVERY DAY THAT A CHILD REMAINS IN SCHOOL. IS A GREAT CREATES A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL SUCCEED EDUCATIONALLY AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL BE. A FUTURE VICTIM OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS PROCESS AND SO. I'M GONNA CUT LEAVE IT AT THAT AT A HIGH LEVEL I COULD GO INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF HOW THE MODEL WORKS IN AND WHERE THE SUPPORTS ARE AT A BASE A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE TIME SPENT ON BUILDING. UNDERSTANDING OF TROM INFORMED PRACTICES AND RESILIENCY AMONG STUDENTS AT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU ACTUALLY GET DOWN TO THE HANDFUL OF STUDENTS WHO REALLY NEED INTENSIVE. TRAUMA INFORMED THERAPIES ON THINGS THAT ARE AKIN TO IEP KIND OF KIND OF STUFF ON AND AND THAT THE MODEL REALLY ACCOMMODATES ALL THOSE THINGS BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SERVE KIDS INDIVIDUALLY. WITH COUNSELING ONE ON ONE AND SEND THEM TO SCHOOL WHERE THE TEACHERS THESE AND SHOWING UP LATE AND JUST THINGS BELIEVES ABSENT A BILL IS TRUANT. OR BELIEVES IS ACTING OUT IN CLASS WHEN THE TRUTH IS BILLY DIDN'T WANT TO COME TO SCHOOL TODAY BECAUSE HIS MOM HAD A NEGATIVE INTERACTION WITH A NEIGHBOR WHO THREATENED TO CALL THE POLICE AND HAVE REMOVED BY ICE. AND HE'S AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID HE'LL COME HOME HIS MOM WON'T BE THERE. AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT TEACHERS. TEACHERS AND STAFF ADMINISTRATORS IN SCHOOLS ARM CAN'T CAN'T DEAL WITH ALL THOSE THINGS AND TEACHERS HAVE THEIR OWN DRAMAS THAT THEY EXPERIENCE SECOND HAND RIGHT TEACHERS. TEACHERS EXPRESS THAT ALL THE TIME AND AND WE REALLY CAN CREATE GREATER COMMUNITY RESILIENCY COST EFFECTIVELY ARE SMART JUSTICE STRATEGY EMPLOYEES A PROCESS WHERE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE THE EXISTING. SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THE EXISTING SCHOOL PARTNERS TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER FOR KIDS WE JUST HAVE TO CHOOSE TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOT THE APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIR PRE SHEET THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AT WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPICS. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER. I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND I'M GONNA SPEAK. SORT OF FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SYSTEM. NAM MOSTLY. RON. MY MEMBERS ADMINISTER THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES IMPOSTER CARE SYSTEMS. AND THE SYSTEM IN WHICH. CHILDREN ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SUFFERED MULTIPLE ACES AND THEIR LIVES. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVERY CHILD IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM HAS AT LEAST TWO ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. THE ABUSE AND NEGLECT. THAT LEAD TO THE REMOVAL AND THE REMOVAL ITSELF WHICH RESEARCH SHOWS IS. AS DRAMATIC AS THE UNDERLYING ABUSE THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY SHOULDN'T BE REMOVED BUT IT IS TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS IN AND OF ITSELF DRAMATIC SO EVERY KID IN OUR SYSTEM. HAS AT LEAST TWO ACES THE REALITY IS THOUGH THAT MANY OF THE CHILDREN OUR SYSTEMS HAVE MORE THAN TWO BECAUSE THE CONSTELLATION. OF. OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. FAMILY VIOLENCE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES EXTREME POVERTY THAT CONSTELLATION OF ISSUES IN REALITY MEANS THAT MOST KIDS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM HAVE MANY ACES. AND ARE AT THE POINT WHERE THE RESEARCH INDICATES ARM. ARE ARE ARE LIKELY TO SUFFER A MOON SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED LIFE OPPORTUNITIES AND WORSE. ON HEALTH AND WELL BEING OUTCOMES. COM. FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT WE SEE EVERY DAY THE RESULTS OF ALL THE RESEARCHERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT. TOM. CHILDREN IN OUR SYSTEM ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE PTSD AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BOB THERE ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A LOT SENSE OF SAFETY SECURITY AND TRUST. BIG DEAL TERRIBLE SHAME OFTEN WONDERING WHY WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE ALL THIS. DIFFICULTY BONDING AND. WE SEE EVERY DAY THAT THE REAL MANIFESTATION OF THE TOXIC STRESS AFFECTS ON THE FIGHTER FLIGHT A MECHANISM IN THE BRAIN. WE SEE KIDS THAT ARE EXTREMELY DISASSOCIATED. BOMB THE FLIGHT. OR. AGGRESSIVE THE FIGHT BOB THAT OFTEN RESULTS IN SERVING ON AN OVERWHELMING SITUATION FOR CAREGIVERS ARM WHO OFTEN ON HAD DIFFICULTY. SORT OF MANAGING. KIDS WHO HAD SO MUCH UNTREATED PRIOR TRAUMA. MOST OF THE KIDS THAT WE SEE IN OUR SYSTEMS HAVE CONTACT WITH OTHER SYSTEMS BEFORE CHILD WELFARE. UMP WHETHER IT'S HEALTH SCHOOLS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCIES SOME DON'T SOME WHEAT SOME OF THE FIRST SYSTEM THAT THEY'VE BEEN. IN CONTACT WITH BUT ONCE THEY COME INTO OUR SYSTEM WE BROKER SERVICES THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SYSTEM DOESN'T DELIVER HEALTH OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WE WORK WITH PARTNER AGENCIES PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT TO DELIVER THE SERVICES. SO FROM WE HAVE IT WE HAVE IT AT A GOOD VANTAGE POINT I THINK ARM TO COME TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION AND THAT'S DESPITE TWO DECADES OF RESEARCH. THAT INDICATES. REALLY WHAT PUBLIC AND AND OTHER SYSTEMS OUGHT TO BE DOING THERE'S A HUGE GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE RESEARCH ON ASUS SUGGEST THAT OUR SYSTEM SHOULD BE DOING AND WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING. AND TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THAT TO HAPPEN. OFFER SOME SOLUTIONS IS IS A PRIVILEGE THAT I'M THAT I'M QUITE THANKFUL FOR. AT. BOTTOM LINE I THINK WE NEED AND INTENTIONALLY COORDINATED STRATEGY. TO CREATE A TROM INFORM SYSTEM WHERE EVERY TOUCH POINT IN A CHILD'S LIFE LOOKS AT AT A CHILD THE A LENS THAT'S TRAUMA INFORMED. BREAKING DOWN SILOS SHARING INFORMATION IT'S ALL REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT. BEAT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE SYSTEM IS INFORMED ABOUT ASUS INFORMED ABOUT TRAUMA. AND LOOKS AT CHILDREN AND IN THE FAMILY ENVIRONMENT FROM THAT CONTEXT. IN THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SYSTEM BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT WE SERVE ABUSED AND NEGLECTED KIDS WE HAVE. BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT WE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING TROM INFORMED PRACTICES FOR FOR MANY YEARS. ARM AND YET THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN OUR SYSTEM AND I WANNA I WANNA TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MAJOR GAPS THAT WE'VE WITNESSED. IN THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT NINETY PERCENT OF THE PARENTS IN OUR SYSTEM THEMSELVES EXPERIENCED TRAUMA MANY ABUSED AND NEGLECTED THEMSELVES MANY OTHER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES IN THEIR LIVES. BOB WE KNOW THAT PRINT OR TRAUMA MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN AND FOR THOSE CHILDREN TO HEAL. BUT THE FEDERAL AND STATE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IS REALLY STRUCTURED IN A WAY. THAT WE HAVE VERY LITTLE FLEXIBILITY TO USE FUNDS ON PREVENTION. SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF FUNDING IN OUR SYSTEM BECOMES AVAILABLE ONCE A CHILD IS REMOVED ONCE THEY'VE ALREADY SUFFERED MULTIPLE A SAYS. AND THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT THAT WE HAVE TO WORK ON. IN THE PHYSICAL HEALTH BROWN WE WERE HAPPY TO SUPPORT A BILL THAT CSJ SPONSORED AB THREE FORTY DOCTOR REGULARS BILL. THAT REQUIRED THAT EP STT IT'S THE MEDI CAL ENTITLEMENT FOR CHILDREN. WHO ARE WHO ARE ON THAT ACCOUNT? THERE'S A REQUIRED SCREENING BASED ON A PERIODICITY SCHEDULE. AND EVERY TIME OPPOSITION SEES A CHILD AN EP STT PROGRAM THEY'RE REQUIRED TO LOOK FOR CYCLE SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. ARM THERE'S NO MANDATE A REQUIREMENT THAT THAT SCREEN THAT ALREADY REQUIRED IN IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT FOR KIDS HAVE A TRAUMA FOCUS IN AB THREE FORTY. WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING ON THE WORKING GROUP AND I HOPE DOCTOR HARRIS. JOINS THAT AS WELL. AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BROWN. EIGHTY PERCENT OF KIDS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ACCORDING TO NATIONAL STUDIES HAVE SOME SORT AB HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT ACCORDING TO NATIONAL STUDIES ONLY ONE THIRD. ARE GETTING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. I'M IN CALIFORNIA THAT THE. PROGRAM OF. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AN INDEPTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT. IMPAIRMENTS IS THE BOMB SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE CALL IT AND THERE'S A PENETRATION RATE THAT WE CALCULATE. IN CALIFORNIA THE PENETRATION RATE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WHO HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH THAT SPECIALITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS FORTY TWO POINT ONE PERCENT ITS MOST RECENT DATA. THAT INFORMATION THAT NUMBER INCLUDES KIDS WERE ASSESSED BUT THEN NOT. SORT OF NOT REFER TO ANY OTHER SERVICE. THE STATE CALCULATE SOMETHING CALLED THE ENGAGEMENT RATE THE ENGAGEMENT RATE IS THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN HAVE HAD FIVE CONTACTS IN A YEAR AND THAT'S THIRTY ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT. SO WHY THIS WHY THIS DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. BOB AND THE DAMAGE IT DOES TO KIDS AND THAT PRECEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND I AT. I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION. BUT BECAUSE EP STT AS A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FEDERAL LAW IT'S QUITE BROAD. IT'S EARLY PERIODIC DIE NOW DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING AND TREATMENT. PROGRAM. AND IF YOU JUST READ THE FEDERAL LAW YOU WOULD SAY WELL THIS IS THE ANSWER TO ISIS. BECAUSE. THE ELIGIBILITY IS BROUGHT TO SERVICES THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO A PRETTY BROAD. BUT IN IN ACTUALITY THE WAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTERS THE PROGRAM IN THE WAY BE ADMINISTERED IN THE STATE AND FUND THAT IN THE STATE. ARM. THE NOTIONS OF MEDICAL NECESSITY AND A DIAGNOSIS FOR AN ACTUAL MENTAL HEALTH I'M ACTUAL MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS SOMETHING IN THE DSM FIVE. REALLY. IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY CREATES THE GATE INTO. US SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SO. THERE THERE IS IN MY OPINION A DISCONNECT BETWEEN. THIS IS THE BIG. THIS IS NOT TO CRITICIZE COUNTIES THIS IS THE NATIONAL WAY THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IS BEHIND IN TERMS OF INCORPORATING THE LEARNING FROM ASUS RESEARCH INTO MODERNIZING ITS DIAGNOSTIC RULES AND ITS TREATMENT RULES. MANDA. THE EAT AN EP FTT STANDS FOR EARLY ARM. AND YET. MUCH OF WHAT'S PROVIDED UNDER THAT ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM PRACTICALLY IT DOESN'T HAPPEN E.. THAT HAPPENS AFTER. THE ACES WAS THE TRAUMA THAT THE CHILD. SUFFERS RESULTS AT SOME POINT OR LEADS TO OUR CONTRIBUTES TO FINALLY THE DIAGNOSIS ON AND WE'VE LOST THAT TIME. TO INTERVENE CELL ON TO SOLUTIONS. IDENTIFICATION IS THE KEY AND I THINK THE NOTION OF AB THREE FORTY SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO OTHER SYSTEM. WE SHOULD TAKE THE IDEA OF A MANDATORY TRAUMA SCREEN AND TAKE THE KEY SYSTEMS THAT INTERACT WITH CHILDREN. SCHOOLS. PHYSICAL OUR HELP BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEE DEE. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND REQUIRE IT. TRAUMA INFORMED SCREEN. I'D LIKE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH ONLY ONE THING THAT ANYONE SAID TODAY AND IT WAS DOCTOR HOW OFTEN EXPRESSED. HIS AMBIVALENCE OVER SCREENING WHEN IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY. HAVE SOMETHING FOR THE CHILD IF WE DO SCREEN. ARM THAT THERE IS A SAYS. BRADLEY'S FOR CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL IF WE SCREEN AND IDENTIFY THAT THERE IS A NEED. IT IS NOT JUST. IT IS AN ENTITLEMENT. UNDER FEDERAL LAW THAT THEY RECEIVE OF APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO REMEDIATE THATNEED. IF THEY'RE IDENTIFIED AS MEDICALLY NECESSARY SO AT LEAST FOR THAT AT LEAST FOR CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL WHICH IS YOU KNOW QUITE A FEW CHILDREN IN THE STATE. ARM WE DO HAVE. OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO TREAT. TRAUMA THAT WE IDENTIFY. WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE THE WAY WE. FUNDS CHILD WELFARE SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE PREVENTION AND WE HAVE TO DO A SIGNIFICANTLY. UP SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TRAINING FOR CARE GIVERS. THE FOR KIDS WHO'VE EXPERIENCED THE TRAUMA OF KIDS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO THEM IS TO BE PLACED INTO FOSTER CARE AND THEN BE PLACED INTO ANOTHER. HOME WHICH IS ANOTHER ACE AND INTO ANOTHER HOME. AND WE NEED TO STABILIZE THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CAREGIVER AND THE CHILD BECAUSE FOR MANY CHILDREN HAVE SUFFERED MULTIPLE A SAYS. POSITIVE. STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE IS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. ASPECT TO HEALING AND SO WE'RE WE'RE PROUD TO AND HERE COMES THAT THE PITCH WE'RE PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FORTY THREE. DOCTOR ARAMBULA IS BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM SO IF YOU'RE A FOSTER PARENT. OR FOSTER CHILD AND THERE'S AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE THERE'S A BEHAVIORAL ISSUE THERE SOME CRISIS THAT HAPPENS. LARGELY TRIGGERED BY TRAUMA THAT. THAT PERSON CAN CALL A HOTLINE BAKER HAD SOMEONE TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THERE CAN BE IT IN PERSON URGENT RESPONSE. STABILIZE THAT SITUATION SO THE CHILD ISN'T MOVED TO A DIFFERENT PLACEMENT. THE FOSTER PARENT ISN'T CALLING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND YOU AND YOUR STRENGTHENING THAT THAT BOND BECAUSE AT THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS NOT RE TRAUMATIZE KIDS ARE IN OUR SYSTEM. AND I THINK THAT THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY PARTNER. AND THEN FINALLY WE CAN'T FORGET POVERTY MIGHT MIGHT MEMBERS ALSO ADMINISTER THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND IN THE CALPERS PROGRAM. AND WE KNOW KIDS IN VERY DEEP POVERTY SUFFER THE WORST TOXIC STRESS THEIR LIFE PROSPECTS ARE THE MOST DIMINISHED CLOSELY BY THE RESEARCH. AND THERE'S LEGISLATION BY SENATOR MITCHELL TO ENHANCE CAL WORKS GRANT SO THAT NO CHILD IN THE STATE LIVES IN VERY DEEP POVERTY ME NEXT WE HAVE DONNA STEERING HER. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND WITH MY COLLEAGUES TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I AGREE. IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE I'M MY NAME'S DONNA SNARE DRUM THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER AND I'VE WORKED IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT CHILD CARE AND. CHILD POVERTY ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA FOR MY WHOLE PROFESSIONAL CAREER SO. I'M I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU ALL MY STORY HIS. OF THE CHILDCARE RESOURCE CENTER ACTUALLY IS A COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND WE SERVE NORTH LOS ANGELES AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. AND WE REALLY STARTED OFF IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AS A CHILD CARE AGENCY. I WORKING WITH FAMILIES TO HELP THEM FIND CHILDCARE SO THEY COULD GO TO WORK WHILE THEIR PARENTS WHILE THEIR CHILDREN WERE LEARNING. AND OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE EXPANDED AND CHANGED OUR SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE NEEDS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND I WILL SAY WATCHING THE STATISTICAL CHANGES THAT I SAW ON THE PRESENTATIONS EARLIER TODAY I'M NOT ALL SURPRISED THAT WE'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME OF THE SHIPS THAT WE HAVE. ON EACH YEAR WE SERVE ABOUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND FAMILIES WHO HAVE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN AND THEY'RE ALL LOW INCOME. AND. BECAUSE OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM WE HAVE REALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF TOXIC STRESS AND POVERTY UP CLOSE. I WE WE DID SOME WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THEIR CHILDREN'S DATA NETWORK. I'M TO ACTUALLY TRY TO DO SOME DATA MATCHING AND SHARING. AND I HAVE WHAT WE FOUND WAS. THIRTY PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN IN OUR CHILDCARE SUBSIDY AND HEAD START SYSTEM WERE KNOWN TO CHILD WELFARE. SO WHAT THAT MEANT TO US WAS THERE IS THIS OVERLAP THERE IS NO IMAGINARY WALL AND ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT CHILDREN ARE FACE SAYING ARE ISSUES THAT ARE IN ARE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS AND BECAUSE OF THAT. WE REALLY HAVE TRIED TO EXPAND OUR REACH AND LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BE BETTER PARTNERS WITH THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WITH MENTAL HEALTH. AND HOW WE CAN BROADEN THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO BE A BETTER SUPPORT TO FAMILIES. I'M AS WAS STATED IN THE PRESENTATIONS THIS MORNING VERY YOUNG CHILDREN GETTING BACK TO BACK TO BASICS BACK TO THE BABIES. BIRTH THROUGH THREE THE MOST RAPID PERIOD OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM TYPES OF POSITIVE SUPPORTS THAT COME FROM SEPARATE STABILIZING FAMILY INCOME AND OVERALL COMMUNITY SUPPORTS. AND ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE OPTIONS NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THIS. I'M DOCTOR THOMPSON WHO SPOKE EARLIER TODAY INCLUDES THE ACCESS TO QUALITY CHILDCARE AS ONE OF HIS PILLARS AND LOOKING AT COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS. AND I THINK WE DO HAVE TO CONSIDER THE CHANGING DYNAMICS THAT WERE ALSO DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY FOR FAMILIES. I MOST FAMILIES HAVE ALL THE ADULTS WORKING. YOU HAVE EITHER A SINGLE PARENT WORKING PARENT OR YOU HAVE TWO PARENTS WORKING WHICH MEANS MOST KIDS ARE IN SOME SORT OF CARE OUTSIDE OF THE HOME EVERYDAY. AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE OFTEN IN MULTIPLE JOBS WITH VERY COMPLICATED SCHEDULES SCHEDULES NONE OF US WOULD WANT. AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AT STRANGE HOURS THAT CHANGE WEEK TO WEEK THAT IN ITSELF CAUSES A GOOD DEAL OF STRESS. I'M AT OUR AGENCY ALONE OVER SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FAMILIES WE SERVE WORK THESE NONTRADITIONAL HOURS AND THEIR IN SERVICE INDUSTRIES. AND THIS CREATES ADDITIONAL STRESSES CONSTANT CHANGE IN PRESSURE TO FIND ARRANGEMENTS FOR CARE ON TOP OF THE EXISTING FINANCIAL STRESSES THAT THEY'RE FACING. WE DO BELIEVE THAT ACCESS TO QUALITY CHILDCARE MITIGATE SOME OF THE STRESSES AND IT CAN BE A PREVENTION AS WELL AS AN EARLY INTERVENTION. AND IF YOU HAVE QUALIFIED CAREGIVERS WHO ARE USING THAT TROMBONE FORMED LANDS. AND THEY CAN HELP IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. SO I DID GO AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE NATIONALLY AND CHILD TRENDS WHO IS A LEADING NONPROFIT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION. FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE LIVES AND PROSPECTS OF CHILDREN. I'M IDENTIFIED SOME KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF EARLY CHILDHOOD. AND THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF CHILDREN HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO TRAUMA THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE PROVIDING CHILDREN WITH AMPLE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY STABLE CARE AND STRONG EARLY LEARNING SUPPORTS. INCREASING EASY PROFESSIONALS ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO TRAUMA. AND EXPANDED INITIATIVES THAT HELP EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS CONNECT FAMILIES TO COMMUNITY SERVICES A FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER TYPE MODEL. AND WE'VE MADE SOME HEADWAY IN CALIFORNIA IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WE SERVE LARGELY IN OUR EXPANSION OF SERVICES TO FOUR YEAR OLDS. FOR THE BIRTH THROUGH THREE GROUP WE REALLY ARE VERY BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF NEED IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THE AMERICANS AND STE IN THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IS DONE A RECENT STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE VERY YOUNGEST CHILDREN BIRTH TO THREE ARE BEING SERVED. AND THOSE ARE KIDS WHO ARE INCOME ELIGIBLE AND IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'VE ALL EXPRESS CONCERN FOR AND THIS LEADS WOULD REALLY CRITICAL GAPS FOR FAMILIES. SO TO SOLUTIONS. I CALIFORNIA HAS EXISTING HOUSE ASSETS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN COULD BE LEVERAGED AND EXPANDED UPON. I CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY LARGE HEAD START CONTRACT WITH THE FEDERAL OF FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE COMING TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I HAVE THERE'S ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN HEAD START FUNDING THAT COMES TO CALIFORNIA. AND THE UNIQUE THING ABOUT HEAD START AND EARLY HEAD START IS IT REALLY IS DESIGNED AS A POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAM AND ITS A COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE THAT LOOKS AT MENTAL HEALTH AND FAMILY SUPPORTS BEYOND JUST THE CLASSROOM LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE FOR US TO ALL CONSIDER WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE IF WE OFFERED THAT TO MORE OF OUR CHILDREN IN POVERTY. SO HOW DO WE TAKE THAT BASED ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAD START IS DOING AND EXPAND THAT EFFORT OUT. I WE OFFICE WE ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MODALITIES. I'M FRANK MENTIONED THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM WHERE FAMILIES HAVE AN ENTITLEMENT TO CHILDCARE WE ALSO HAVE A ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT GENERAL CHILDCARE PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. BUT MORE ACCESS IS NEEDED AND THIS IS WHERE MY. MY TWO CENTS FOR THIS YEAR'S ASKS COMES AND I'M WE REALLY BELIEVE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR FAMILIES THE SHARE. OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET WHICH WAS RECENTLY SIGNED DOES INCLUDE AN EXPANSION IN THE FEDERAL CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT. SO THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL ACCESS COMING TO CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THE STATE IS ABLE TO MATCH AND GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THOSE EFFORTS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU SEE PROFESSIONALS. HAVE ACCESS TO TROMBONE FORM TRAINING AND I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE KIND OF CROSSING SECTORS IN THIS PAST YEAR IS CREATED A. FOSTER CARE BRIDGE PROGRAM FOR CHILDCARE. AND THE UNIQUE THING ABOUT THAT IS IT INCLUDED TRAUMA INFORMED CARE TRAINING FOR THE PROVIDERS WHO ARE WORKING WITH THE CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. I THINK IT'S A GOOD DEMONSTRATION IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS AND WE'RE DOING A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO BUILD. THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THOSE TWO SYSTEMS BUT IT IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A PLACE YOU COULD CONTINUE TO LOOK TO BUILD. AND I'M AYE OF ALSO WANTED TO MENTION HOME VISITING I KNOW IT CAME UP EARLIER THAT CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT HOME VISITING MODELS. AND THEY ARE FUNDED BY A VARIETY OF SOURCES INCLUDING FEDERAL. OF FUNDS EARLY HEAD START LOCAL TO A FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS. BUT THEY'RE NOT CONSISTENTLY AVAILABLE FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE I'M AND THESE WOULD BE OTHER POWER PLATFORMS WHICH YOU COULD CHOOSE TO BUILD UPON. I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR TIME AND I'M GLAD TO GET AND WITH BABIES. AND I'M HAPPY TO BE LAST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL START WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE DIETS AND THEN I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AS WELL ON ANY OF THE PANEL WERE. S. COUSINS WHO CAME UP BUT FIRST ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE. THE LAST PANEL AND SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS I'M FAMILIAR WITH SOME AT THE THE REQUEST YEAR AND WILL SEEM AN ARE RESPECTED SUBCOMMITTEES AND THEIR. THERE WERE THE. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SAID NO BRAINER TO INVESTING IN AND THAT FAMILIES AND KIDS AND POVERTY ARE GONNA GET. AT THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK AS FAR AS THAT SOLUTIONS UP BY DOING A KIND OF GO BACK TO TWO PANELS AGO WE TALKED ABOUT. THAT THIS SCREENING AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S THAT. IT'S WHERE THE TO DO IT'S IT WHEN BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE LET'S LAY IN A HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE. REPORT CARD AND THAT NOTHING TO DO. NO REMEDY TO GIFTED TO GET THE FAMILY SO WHAT I WANTED TO ASK IS I I THINK I'D RATHER HAVE THAT SCREENING IT'S LIKE YOU AND YOU YOU YOU WANTED TO HAVE THE DOCTOR NOT SO YOU HAVE SOME HORRIBLE ILLNESS NOT OTHER NO. AND THEN DEAL WITH NO TO DO WIT WITH THAT SO I THINK WE SHOULD ERR ON MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE SCREENINGS. OTHER WET PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE IS OUR KINDERGARTENERS SCHOOL SYSTEM SO. WHERE WHERE CHYNA IN ACCORD THERE? BUT IF WE DID HAVE. YOU KNOW. THE MAGIC. THE BOX THE CASE HERE OR SHOE BOX WITH YOU KNOW LET'S SAY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING TODAY BESIDES THE FACT THAT WE KNOW. ESPECIALLY FROM THAT WELFARE DIRECTORS AND THAT. CHILD CARE AND DEC WORLD KIND OF WHAT THE ASK OUR WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THAT THEIR REMEDIES WOULD HAVE OUT THERE LET'S SAY ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERY. YOU KNOW KINDERGARTNERS HOW TO SCORE AND AND SOME PEOPLE OFF THE CHARTS WE WANT TO GIVE. GRANTS TO NONPROFITS A SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DO STUFF YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD WE. DO IF ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAD ONE. BUT BASICALLY A DIAGNOSIS FOR ALL THESE KIDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA INTO A POTENTIAL. THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A SOUND BEST. DURING A FOR SHOWING HER HOW AM I I MEAN THE FIRST THING WE WOULD DO REALLY WOULD BE RESTRUCTURING SCHOOLS AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY INTERACT WITH THE STUDENTS. SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW DOCTOR BURKE HARRIS TALKED ABOUT HAVING MINDFULNESS HAVING THINGS THAT ARE PART OF THE SCHOOL DAY THAT WOULD HELP TO BUFFER THAT TRAUMA THAT STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING. HELP THEM LEARN HOW TO REGULATE THEIR EMOTIONS. IT IN WAYS THAT WE KNOW ARE PREVENTIVE SO THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE HARDEST TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON FUNDING YES FOR OF AND CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY BUT THERE ALSO ARE THINGS WE CAN DO AS FROM A POPULATION BASED PERSPECTIVE FOR EVERYONE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE SCORED THE YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A HIGH LEVEL LEVEL OF CONCENTRATED TRAUMA AND IN MANY INSTANCES WHEN WE DO THE A SCORE AS A REMINDER WE DON'T HAVE THE COMMUNITY TRAUMA AS WELL. SO YOU COULD HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL A SCORE OF ZERO BUT STILL BE TRAUMATIZED BY SOME OF THE COMMUNITY TRAUMAS THAT ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU LIVE WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY AS WELL AND SO THAT THAT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT WOULD HAVE A WAY OF BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE. A BUFFER FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ADDITION TO THE PROGRAMMATIC INVESTMENTS. FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CLINICAL. YEAH THAT'S A SOME OF THESE ARE CISPA SUCKS SOCIETAL ON PARTS THE COMMUNITY IN. IN OUR J. GENERATIONAL POVERTY AND JUST LIKE YOU KNOW MILLIONS AND BILLIONS TO TO IMPACT THAT. BUT BUT LET'S SAY ALL OF A SUDDEN. BECAUSE IF YOU DID THIS SCREENING WOULD BE PRIMARILY FOR YOUNGER KIDS WRITINGS OF THE KINDERGARTENERS OR LET'S SAY THE PEDIATRICIAN LEVEL BEFORE BEFORE IT'S A LET'S SAY ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAD. FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA. KIDS ALL OF SOLICITOR WERE UNDER SIX YEARS OFF. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEIR FAMILY OR LOVED ONE ALL OF A SUDDEN HAD. YEAH A LETTER FOR. AND THE NOTE SAYS HATE. AND YOUR NOT IN LET'S SAY HEAD START PROGRAM YOU NOT NECESSARILY. PART OF IT OF THE OF THE SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT THAT COULD BE THERE AND SO WHAT SHOULD CALIFORNIA DUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE. KIDS. HAVE SOMETHING YOU'RE TALKING. I I'M SURE I'M GONNA STICK AWAY SOME OF MISTER MAC AS THUNDER BUT I'VE A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS. I MEAN IF IF THERE MEDI CAL INVOLVED THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING ASSISTANCE NOW YEAH BUT THEY'RE NOT THE I UNDERSTAND I THINK THAT THAT IS A NON MONETARY ALL OF SOME MIGHT SAY THERE'S A MONETARY ISSUE. THAT IS A THAT IS A IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE THAT IS LONG OVERDUE TO BE FIXED AND THAT. PERHAPS MILLER DOT DOCTOR ARAMBULA IS COMMITTEES A LITTLE MORE VESTED IN IT BUT I BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ANGRY BECAUSE OUR OUR POSITION ESPECIALLY FOR. CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE IS THAT MANY OF THESE CHILDREN ON WHO DO EVEN THOUGH WE WERE WORKING ON MAKING EPS DTM MORE SCREEN. IN FRIENDLY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN IDENTIFY CHILDREN EARLIER. THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE ACCESS YOU HEARD ABOUT THE PENETRATION RATES AND THE ENGAGEMENT RATES THOSE ARE VERY LOW RATES AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVING WORKED ON AB THREE FORTY SO INTIMATELY THEY VARY SO GREATLY BY COUNTY. YOU CAN BE IN COUNTY A AND HAVE AN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT NINETY PERCENT PENETRATION RATE YOU CAN BE COUNTY BE NEXT DOOR HAVE A FIFTEEN PERCENT RATE. AND COUNTIES ARE NOT SPENDING THE MONEY THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE USED FOR JUVENILE MENTAL HEALTH. ACROSS THE BOARD EVENLY THERE'S NOT CONSISTENCY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PROGRAM SO ON THE ONE LEVEL IF YOU WANT TALK ABOUT SYSTEMIC CHANGES USING THE SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE THE SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE IN MY. PERSONAL OPINION I THINK MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT BE AGREEING WITH ME. DOESN'T WORK THE WAY IT'S DESIGNED WORK RIGHT NOW AND SO IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY MAKE AND MAJOR IMPACT YOU WANT TO SCREEN THOSE KIDS BECAUSE I AGREE YOU SHOULD BE SCREENING THOSE KIDS. AND YOU WANT THE PARENT AND THE IN THE FAMILY TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THE TRUTH IS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE FINDING OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE BEING TOLD THERE'S YOU JUST NEED CASE MANAGEMENT. YOU JUST NEED SOME OTHER LOW LEVEL INTERVENTION THEY'RE NOT BEING GIVEN THE THERAPY AND COUNSELING AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE THE SPECIALTY METAL HORSE HEALTH SERVICES THE CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA NEED. ESPECIALLY IN FOSTER YOU SITUATIONS A LOT OF FOSTER KIDS WHO DON'T GET THE TYPE OF INTERVENTIONS THEY NEED NOW TO THE QUESTION ABOUT WE HAVE THE SCALE OF COST AND HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SKILLED OUT ONE OF THE PROPOSALS WE HAVE THIS YEAR. IS TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN SCHOOLS TO PILOT TRYING TO CHANGE THE WAY SCHOOLS OPERATE WITH A TRAUMA INFORM SCHOOL MENTALITY IT DROMUND FROM SCHOOL PROGRAM WHERE YOU BASICALLY COME IN AND YOU CAN MAKE AN INVESTMENT. IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT YOU COULD SCREEN ALL THOSE KIDS IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT AT SCHOOL. RIGHT AND THERE'S GONNA THEY'RE GONNA CRAWL ALL OVER THE MAP PROBABLY RIGHT IN SOME COMMUNITIES ARE GONNA BE VERY HAPPY ON THE DRAMA SIDE. AND THE REALITIES YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT. AT A MUCH LOWER COST THAN YOU WOULD IF YOU WERE TRYING TO INDIVIDUALLY TREAT KIDS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY IF YOU TRY TO BUILD THE RESILIENCY THAT IMMUNE SYSTEM. ID I KIND OF TRY TO PROMOTE EARLIER YOU ACTUALLY PUT INSIDE THE SCHOOL THE TRAUMA INFORMED PROVIDER THE PERSON WHO WAS THERE AT THE RESOURCE TO THE TEACHERS AS THE RESOURCE TO THE STUDENTS NOT JUST INDIVIDUALLY BUT COLLECTIVELY AND THAT IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE COMMUNITY RESILIENCY. OUT OF HAVING ALL THOSE CHILDREN BE IN THE SAME PLACE AND BE AT A PLACE OF EDUCATED ARE OF ELEVATED ON COLLABORATION WITH ONE ANOTHER JUST MAKE ME PRACTICAL LEVEL TO SAY THERE'S AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT HAS. FOR KINDERGARTEN CLASS YOU AND THERE'S. TWENTY FIVE KIDS. ROGER RIGHT LET'S SAY. ARE A QUARTER OF THE KITS HAVEN'T ACES SCORE FIVE BY RACH. AND SO YOU HAD THOSE TWELVE TWENTY FIVE. GET SO WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE LIKE IT'S KID LIKE. IT'S THE WRONG TERM LIKE A VOUCHER FOR THEY CAN GO LIKE A COUPON TO GO. GET A SERVICE OR WOULD YOU TRY TO BRING SOMEONE IN THE SERVICE WILL IN HOUSE ALL TWENTY FIVE WOULD BE IN THE SCHOOL WOULD BE A SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICE. THAT THE SAID THE SCHOOL ESSENTIALLY IS GETTING THE SOCIAL WORKER THE CARE PROVIDER WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO BRING IN OTHER RESOURCES IF NECESSARY BUT THAT PERSON IS THE LOCUS FOR THE CARE. IN THE SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO HAS DAY TO DAY RELATIONSHIPS WITH TEACHERS STAFF AND THE STUDENTS BECAUSE PART OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE IS ABOUT RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND TRUST AND RIGHT SO YOU'RE ALREADY IN THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE SUPPORTER THERE IN THE SCHOOL. AND VOUCHERS REQUIRES THE FAMILY TO GO FIND CARE PROVIDER AND THAT'S WHAT THE SYSTEM IS FAILING TO DO RIGHT NOW. BUT ALSO TO GIVE TWENTY FIVE I MEAN JUST TO USE YOUR EXAMPLE IF YOU'VE TWENTY FIVE KIDS OF A SCORE FIVE OR HIGHER YOU ALSO OF SOMEWHERE ONE THAT'S FOR THAT'S THREE THAT'S TO THAT SEVEN THAT RIGHT LIKE SO. YOU YOU I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU DON'T WANT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ARE ALREADY HAD A SCORE FIVE OR HIGHER YOU REALLY NEED TO ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT THE THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT IN GENERAL AS WELL. NOT JUST LITERALLY A CLASSROOM FULL OF STUDENTS WHO ARE TRAUMATIZED. I WOULD ADD IT SCREENING IS DONE ROUTINELY IN SCHOOLS ARM OR DONE BY PEDIATRICIANS. THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE SCREENING OCCURS THAT THERE SHOULD BE STRONG CONNECTIONS BETWEEN. THE SCHOOL THE SCHOOL THAN THE PHYSICAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY IT SHOULD BE EASY FOR THEM. TO HELP. YOU KNOW TO CONNECT WITH US TO GET SERVICES TO FAMILIES THAT ARE ALREADY. YOU NO AVAILABLE THEIR THEIR THEIR PEOPLE FOR GOOD BECAUSE THEY LIVE ISOLATED DRAMATIC WAYS WHO ARE DISCONNECTED SO I THINK. I THINK A CONNECTIVE TISSUE BETWEEN THAT FRONTLINE. SCREENER AND THE AND THE THE BACK AND SOCIAL SERVICES I THINK IS THAT IS A COST EFFECTIVE AND PROBABLY. RELATIVELY SMALL AND SORT OF THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS TYPE OF INVESTMENT. I THINK WE WE ALSO WOULD DO IF I COULD. JUST SORT OF. REPEAT THERE'S THIS THERE'S THIS DISCONNECT NATIONALLY I THINK BETWEEN WHAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MEANS AND WHAT THE H. HAS RESOURCE SAYS. AND AS LONG AS THE BIG GATE TO. SORT OF. INTENSIVE THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS AND FLEXIBLE TYPES OF OPTIONS IS A DIAGNOSIS. SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE DSM IT'S WE'RE GONNA WAIT TILL IT TILL IT'S TOO LATE. AND YOU DON'T CURE A SAYS WITH A FIFTY MINUTE HOUR ON MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. THE IN THERAPY WE NEED FLEXIBLE. CREATIVE SERVICE SAYS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO KIDS WHERE THEY WHERE THEY ARE. AND. AGAIN NO DISRESPECT OR CRITICISM OF EXISTING PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE WORKING THEIR* OFF EVERY DAY. BUT BUT THIS. THAT THE SYSTEMS MANY SYSTEMS INCLUDING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM HAVE BEEN TOO SLOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS ACES IS SERIOUS. ARM AND IT IS THE BUSINESS OF CHILD WELFARE IT IS THE BUSINESS OF EDUCATION IT IS THE BUSINESS THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NOT JUST SOMETHING ON THE OUTSIDE THAT WE LOOK AT AND WAIT FOR THINGS TO GET REALLY BAD. BEFORE WE DECIDE TO INTERVENE. AND AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S EXAMPLES IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SYSTEM. WHERE YOU COULD TAKE THAT MODEL FROM HEAD START WHERE THERE IS A MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONER ASSIGNED TO EVERY CLASSROOM IN EVERY EARLY HEAD START EXPERIENCE WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU TOOK IT TO KINDERGARTEN? I I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THINGS THAT HAVE WORKED AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE REFERENCE EARLIER TO INFANT MENTAL HEALTH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND THE SOONER YOU INTERVENE THE SOONER THERE'S A PLAN THE SOONER WE START MITIGATION AND THE LESS PROBLEMS THERE ARE DOWN THE ROAD. AND WHAT'S MISSING IS THAT THE CRITICAL SUPPORT TO THE PRACTITIONERS. ASSESSMENT IS PART OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CHILD ASSESSMENTS ARE DONE ALL THE TIME. ADDING THIS END TO WHAT IS ALREADY DONE WITH THE APPROPRIATE CONNECTION. TO THOSE SERVICES THAT KIDS NEED. WOULD BE A GOOD PATH TO PURSUE. JUST WANT TO ADD ONE THING IN LIGHT OF ALL THE REALLY GOOD COMMENTS SO DOCTOR NADINE BURKE OPEN AND TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THREE THINGS EARLY SCREENING EARLY DETECTION AND INTERVENTION RIGHT THAT'S WE ALL WE ALL AGREE ON THAT. AND SO IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. IF YOU PLACE PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES IF YOU DO SCHOOL BASS TROMBONE FORM PROGRAM. GAVE YOU ARE PREPARED. SCREEN CHILDREN. WHEN ASUS HAPPEN SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOME KIDS WHO HAVE ZEROS AND ONES TODAY. WHO WILL HAVE A LIFE EVENT OR SERIES OF LIFE EVENTS IN THEIR HOME FOR THEIR COMMUNITY AND YOU ARE ALREADY NOW PREPARED? TO INTERVENE BECAUSE YOU WERE ENGAGED IN A SCREENING PRACTICE IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS SENSITIVE TO DETECTION AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTIONS TOOLS AVAILABLE TO YOU. THAT IS WHY OUR OPINION IS YOU NEED TO YOU NEED TO INVEST IN TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM INTO CREATING A WHOLE COMMUNITY WITH. SCHOOL AND THE OTHER THING IS YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE THE WALLS OF THE SCHOOL BUT. YOU KNOW A AND AND THE ENVIRONMENT INVERSES OUT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DON'T TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW TO. SOME EVER MCCARTY'S COMMITTEES TEACHERS. RIGHT TEACHERS. TEACHERS ABSORB TRAUMA EVERYDAY THEY GO HOME AYE AYE JUST TELL YOU AS A LAWYER I CLIENTS WHO I WAS DID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LITIGATION I HAD TO LEAVE THE PRACTICE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALLEGATION. BECAUSE IT WAS SO EMOTIONAL DRAMATIC TO ME TAP CLIENTS THAT. PHOTOS OF THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED A CLIENTS IT WAS EXTREMELY DRAMATIC I HAD I HAD THAT THE SECOND. EFFECTS OF TRAUMA MY LIFE AND EVEN KNOWS GOING ON IF I WAS A TEACHER AND EVERY DAY I HAD TO COME IN TO% SCHOOL AND I HAD CHILD WHOSE WERE AND HE WAS WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES FOR TWO WEEKS IN A ROW. WHO DIDN'T HAVE FOOD TO EAT? WASN'T SLEEPING WHO WAS UP AT THREE IN THE MORNING BECAUSE THERE IS A FAMILY TRANSFER AT NIGHT THOSE TYPES OF THINGS I KNEW THAT I WOULD HAVE A VERY. HARD TIME BEING RESILIENT IN MY JOB AND THEN GIVING A HUNDRED PERCENT OF MY CARE. TO ALL THE KIDS I HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERYDAY AND BY HAVING THAT LOCUSTS IN THE SCHOOL THAT TROMBONE FROM PRACTICE IN THE SCHOOL YOU'RE ALSO BUILDING RESILIENCY WITH YOUR TEACHING FORCE. AND THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE BETTER TEACHER PRODUCT AS THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE HEALTH CARE TO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT KIDS IT'S ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES THAT COMMUNITY ASPECT. THEY NEED THAT TOO AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN THE SCHOOL. SO I WANTED TO END WITH ONE COMMENT AND THEN WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT IF I COULD. YOU KNOW I. WAS INTERESTED WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW INFANT MORTALITY IS A METRIC THAT WE DO FOLLOW. AND EARLIER WE HEARD FROM DOCTOR THOMPSON WHO TALKED ABOUT THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. AND OFTENTIMES I LOOK AT OUR INFANT MORTALITY AND. LOOK AT THE TRAUMA THAT HAPPENS TO TOO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE MUST BE HONEST ABOUT IT. AND I WANTED TO. TALK ABOUT A FEW SOLUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE ME BECAUSE OFTENTIMES YOU CAN HEAR PRESENTATIONS LIKE THIS. AND. THEY CAN GET YOU DOWN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE OUR COMMUNITIES BUT THERE ARE REAL OPPORTUNITIES HERE. AND ONE OF THEM I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT COMING INTO THIS YEAR WAS THE HOME VISITING PROGRAMS THE GOVERNOR IS PUSHING. HOW WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AT A YOUNG AGE FROM ZERO TO AGE TO? IN OUR FAMILIES THAT HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS TO BE IMPACTING THEM AND MEETING THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT. TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. HAVE AYE AYES HAVE A TRUSTED PRACTITIONER WHO'S IN FRONT OF US IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE TRAUMA THAT IS AFFECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND. SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS BUT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IF I COULD WHAT I DO THINK IS A POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY AN OVERLAP BETWEEN EDUCATION. WHICH IS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING. THIS IDEA THAT YOU HAVE A. ADULT CARING REPRESENTATIVE AT A SCHOOL IF THEY DON'T HAVE A PARENT AT HOME IS NOT PROVIDING THAT. AMOUNT OF NURTURING AND SAFETY. AND. YEAH I'M REMINDED OF WHAT OPRAH SAID AND SINCE SHE'S NOW GOING ON SIXTY MINUTES TALKING ABOUT A SAYS A. PROBABLY TRUE BUT SHE SAID THAT. AT A SCHOOL IS WHERE SHE FOUND AND FELT SAFE. THAT THERE WAS AN ADULT WHO CARED ABOUT HER AND. IS THAT A MODEL THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND HOW WE CAN HELP TO EMPOWER OUR EDUCATORS. AND OUR SCHOOLS TO BE SAFE PLACES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. SO WITH THOSE EXAMPLES AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS I THINK WE HAVE OUR WORK WORK CUT OUT FOR US AS A STATE. BUT IDENTIFYING THIS EARLY DETECTING IT AND PROVIDING THEM AND INTERVENTION IS OUR ROLE. IF FOR SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING TO GET AHEAD OF THIS COST CURVE OF GOING UPSTREAM ON THESE PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND RECOGNIZE. AND TREAT TRAUMA MUCH EARLIER THAN WE ARE NOW. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK THIS PANEL FOR COMING HERE TODAY. WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT YOU MAY HAVE ON THIS INFORMATION. GOOD AFTERNOON ADRIN SULTAN WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO COMMEND THE LEADERSHIP OF THESE COMMITTEES. FOR ORGANIZING THIS HEARING ON SUCH A CRITICAL TOPIC. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ADDRESSING CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES OF OUR TIME. AND THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE IS REALLY COMMITTED TO BRINGING THE RESEARCH AND WORK ON A SISTER THE FOREFRONT. OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION COMPONENT WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY WITH THE PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION COMPONENT WHICH IS A. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INVESTMENT OF DOLLARS TO BE MUCH MORE STRATEGIC AND FOCUSED IN TERMS OF THE CRITICAL. MODELS OF CARE THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED WITH THESE DOLLARS AND WE BELIEVE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA PREVENTION. AND EARLY INTERVENTION SHOULD BE ONE OF THOSE WERE SPONSORING LEGISLATION THIS SESSION ARE SENATE BILL TEN OH FOUR AUTHORED BY BOTH SENATOR WIENER. AND SENATOR MORLOCK WHICH WOULD ENSURE. THAT CHILDREN WHO WERE EXPOSED TO TRAUMA AND VIOLENCE HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. SO S. B. TUNNEL FOUR SETS UP A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AND PROVIDES A MANDATE FOR THE COUNTIES I'M IN ONE OF THOSE PRIORITY AREAS THAT SHOULD BE A FOCUS IS. CHILDHOOD TRAUMA PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION WITH ACTUALLY LOOK TO THAT RESEARCHERS. THAT HAVE PRESENTED TODAY TO FRAME OUT THIS PRIORITY IN THE LEGISLATION. AND REALLY WANT TO JUST BE ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THIS TOPIC AND REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE GIVENS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND AT THE CORE OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION IS PREVENTION. AND SO WE AND FROM OUR STANDPOINT IN ADDITION TO JUST PREVENTING CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND DISEASES WE REALLY THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO ALSO DO PREVENTION ON THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. AND ACES IS ONE OF THEM AS YOU'VE HEARD ON THROUGH A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND WE ALSO FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH STANDPOINT AND DEPARTMENT SIMPLY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN A LOT OF STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES TO REALLY PREVENT. AND KNOWINGLY OR EVEN UNKNOWINGLY AT PREVENT ADDITIONAL ACES IN THE FUTURE AND THINGS AROUND VIOLENCE PREVENTION INITIATIVES ARE OPIOID AS COALITION. WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TO. REDUCE HARM AND TO PREVENT OVERDOSES ON THAT ALSO PREVENT AT NEW ADDICTIONS AND SO FORTH AND THEN ALSO WE SPEARHEAD THE. NURSE HOME VISITING PROGRAMS OUT OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND. IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS DOING IN HIS PROPOSAL TO BRING A NEW* VISITING AB PROGRAM TO LIGHT WE STILL DON'T THINK THAT IT'S ENOUGH THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE A NEED OMINOUS SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WILL NOT HAVE A HOME VISITING PROGRAMS. AND SO WE URGE AND ADDITIONAL ATTENTION TO THAT MATTER AND WE WANT TO WORK AND BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU ONLY THINK YOU FOR HAVING IT TODAY. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS GAIL YOUNG CHILDREN NOW. WE'RE STATEWIDE AFTER SEE ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROMOTING CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND EDUCATION AND OVERALL WELL BEING. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE BOTH ASSEMBLYMEMBERS I'M ARAMBULA AND MCCARTY FOR PLAYING ON THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION OR HEARING. WE ARE ACTUALLY VERY EXCITED TO BE A PART OF THE AB THREE FORTY ADVISORY GROUP AND WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. IF YOU. AND DOCTOR MARTHA MERCHANT AND I'M WITH YOU CASF PARTS HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS RESPONSE TROHMAN SCHOOLS.

I JUST WANNA SAY THAT WE HAD REALLY GREAT IDEAS AND LOTS OF WONDERFUL COMMENTARY AND I KEEP HEARING PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT MORE SERVICES RESOURCES LIKE THERAPY. AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE JUST WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT I THINK IS A GREAT IDEA AND. AND I ALSO THINK YOU KNOW IN YOUR EXAMPLE ABOUT FIVE KIDS IN EVERY CLASSROOM THAT HAVE HAD FIVE OR MORE ACES THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THOSE CHILDREN ONLY NEED THERAPY. ARE JUST BECAUSE YOU HAD THEM IF YOU'VE HAD RESILIENT FACTORS IN YOUR LIFE YOU MAY NOT JUST LIKE MAYA ANGELOU WHO HAD ALL THOSE. THINGS HAPPEN TO HER RIGHT BUT SHE WAS RESILIENT SHE HAD SOMEONE WHO CARED ABOUT HER. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE SCHOOL CHANGE WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT. PROVIDING THERAPY AT TO EVERYONE IN THE SCHOOL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE COMMUNITY SO THAT COMMUNITY ENHANCES RESILIENCE FACTORS FOR EVERYBODY TEACHERS AS HE WAS AS A JOHN WAS SAYING. AND ALSO FOR STUDENTS SO THAT. IF YOU HAD SOME FIVE KIDS IN IN THE FOR CLASSROOMS THAT IT HAD TRAUMA THEY BE EXPERIENCING. BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ALL DAY LONG FROM THEIR TEACHER WHO ISN'T A FAIR BILLS BUT WHO CAN PROVIDE A SAFE AND COMPASSIONATE PERSON. WHO CAN PROVIDE PREDICTABILITY AND SAFETY IN THE CLASSROOM RIGHT SO THAT YOU WOULD BE? BY HAVING EVERYONE A SCHOOL TRAINED. EVERYBODY IN THE SCHOOL IS BENEFITING. ALL DAY SO THAT'S WHAT I WANNA SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU DOCTOR. HELLO MY NAME IS ANA HOW SUPPLIED WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA.
