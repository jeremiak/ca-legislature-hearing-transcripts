TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO SIXTY SEVEN WHICH IS A NECESSARY MEASURE THAT WILL STREAMLINE WILDFIRE FUEL AND REDUCTION PROJECTS. IN CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS YESTERDAY I HAD PREPARED MY REMARKS FOR THIS BILL AND IN THOSE REMARKS I WAS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT HOW CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT CONDITIONS MAKE IT RIGHT FOR FUTURE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. I WANTED TO DRIVE HOME THE POINT THAT WE CANNOT CONTINUE TIPTOEING AROUND THE OBVIOUS CALIFORNIA IS IN A DROUGHT. AND OUR OPEN SPACES AND FORCES ARE WOEFULLY IN NEED OF TREATMENT AND CARE. I WAS PREPARED TO STAND HERE AND CONVINCE YOU THAT WE NEED TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGES TODAY SO THAT TOMORROW WE CAN ALL BREATHE EASY. THEN LATE YESTERDAY I STARTED RECEIVING DISTRESS CALLS. FOR MY CONSTITUENTS TEXT MESSAGES FROM FRIENDS AND EVEN MY FAMILY MEMBERS ALERTING ME TO A WILDFIRE IN MY DISTRICT. NOT BUT A FEW MILES FROM MY HOME. AND MY DISTRICT OFFICE THAT FIRE HAS GROWN TO ONE OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES WE RECORDED THIS YEAR. I GOT REGULAR UPDATES AT THE BURN OF THE BURN AREA. AS IT GREW FROM FIFTY ACRES TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACRES. TWO HOURS OF THIS MORNING SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACRES. THIS FIRE HAS PROMPTED THE EVACUATION OF AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY BETTER BACK HOME THIS MORNING AS OUR FIREFIGHTERS HIT THAT FIGHT HARD LAST NIGHT. IT'S POLLUTED OUR AIR WITH NOXIOUS SMOKE AND ASH. AND WE'RE STILL IN APRIL. I WISH I COULD STAND HERE TODAY AND TELL YOU THAT THIS FIRE IS AN ODDITY. BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US ON THIS FLOOR KNOWS. THAT IS SADLY A PART OF THE NEW NORMAL THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING FORCED TO LIVE WITH. WE CAN NO LONGER SHY AWAY FROM THE BOLD ACTION NECESSARY. TO TACKLE WILDFIRES WE MUST COMMIT TO PROGRAMS AND FUNDING THAT ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE THERE IS NO PROGRAM TO GREAT. AND NO PROGRAM TO SMALL. WE MUST MITIGATE THESE WILDFIRES AT EVERY LEVEL POSSIBLE. AND ASSEMBLY BILL TWO SIXTY SEVEN IS A BILL THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. MEMBERS TO HELP SAFEGUARD OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES. THAT POSE TO OUR HOMES TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO LIVE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU.

IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ARE A CONSTANT RISK IN CALIFORNIA AND THE DEVASTATING AND WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF EACH WILDFIRE SEASON. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE REAL. WITH A WILDFIRE THAT STARTED YESTERDAY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL% WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN OUR OWN DISTRICTS IT MORE ACTION IS NOT TAKEN. IN THE AKE OF THE LOOMING DROUGHT IT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO STREAMLINE AND ACCELERATE WILDFIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS TO REDUCE FORCED FEEL LESSEN THE SEVERITY OF FIRE SEASONS. AND HELP BUILD LONG TERM WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. AB TWO SIX TWO SIX SEVEN DOES JUST THAT THIS BILL STRIKES A PRACTICAL BALANCE.

SENATE BILL NINETY TWO BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET OFFICE CURFEW AND ACCORDING TO JUVENILE JUSTICE AND MAKING A PROVISION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECTIVELY BUILD RELATED TO THE BUDGET. MISTER K. YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SB NINETY TWO WELL ESTABLISHED THE REALIGNMENT OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE TO COUNTIES THAT WERE INCLUDED THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET OCT. IT'S TECHNICAL CONFORMING CHANGES AND ESTABLISHES A CLOSURE DATE. OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IMPACTING APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY JUVENILES. ANNUALLY SB NINETY TWO PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR THIS TALISMAN A USE OF SECURE YOU TREATMENT FACILITIES FOR CERTAIN YOU. WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR A COMMITMENT TO DJJ. JUDICIAL COUNCIL BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND ADAPT A MATRIX OFFENSE OF. BASED CLASSIFICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF REAL. OF A REHABILITATION PLAN AND REGULAR PROGRESS REVIEW HEARINGS OF YOUTH. ON THE SECURE TRACK. THE TOPICS OF THESE PROVISIONS WERE ORIGINALLY INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BILL. SB EIGHT TO THREE. BUT IN RECOGNITION OF NEEDING ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS. WE COMMITTED. TO COMPLETE THESE PROVISIONS IN THE SPRING. DURING A SIX MONTH PERIOD WE RECEIVED INPUT FROM JUDGES. PROBATION COUNTIES YOUTH ADVOCATES WHICH ULTIMATELY CULMINATED AT S. B. NINETY TWO WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER TEAM FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. NINETY TWO NOT ONLY DOES THIS BILL INSTITUTE SUBSTANTIAL POLICY CHANGES THAT ARE INAPPROPRIATE FOR A TRAILER BILL. BUT IT DOES A HUGE DISSERVICE TO YOUTH OFFENDERS IT WOULD BE PUSHED TOWARDS COUNTY PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVE MINIMAL SUPPORT FROM THE STATE. AND EVEN WORSE IT STILL LEAVES COUNTIES DEPRIVED OF CONSISTENT FUNDING AS WE SLAMMED MORE MORE RQUIREMENTS THEIR WAY. THIS BILL ADVOCATES FOR BOTH A COMPLETE REORGANIZATION OF OUR JUVENILE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE SENTENCING REDUCTIONS. A TRAILER BILL IS NO PLACE TO PUSH THROUGH AN ENTIRE AGENCY REORGANIZATION LET ALONE ADVANCE SUBSTANTIAL POLICY CHANGES WE ARE DEALING WITH AN INCREDIBLY FRAGILE AND VOLATILE POPULATION. THESE YOUNG OFFENDERS HAVE BEEN CHARGED ABOUT POTENTIAL WITH THE CHARGED WITH THE RAPE MURDER. ARSON ROBBERY KIDNAPPING ASSAULT TORTURE OR OTHER SERIOUS CRIMES YOUTH OFFENDERS IN IN THE PROGRAM NEED INTENSIVE PROGRAMS RANGING FROM COUNSELING TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT TO OPPORTUNITIES IN EDUCATION. BUT BY DIVIDING THE RESPONSIBILITY AMONG COUNTIES TO HOUSE THESE OFFENDERS REHABILITATIVE SERVICES WILL BE INCONSISTENT INEFFICIENT AND ISOLATED INSTEAD OF OUTRIGHT CLOSING DJJ WE OWE IT TO THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO CRAFT A COLLABORATION. BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES. TO FILL THE NECESSARY AND CRITICAL ROLE. OF A TREATMENT CAN TO. CONTINUE ON FOR THIS FIVE OF OFFENDERS. BUT SB NINETY TWO SHIPS TOO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY ON DRUG COUNTIES WOULD NOT NEARLY ENOUGH SUPPORT TO JUSTIFY A VOTE TODAY. BY AND LARGE THIS IS A CLEAR ABUSE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS I HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT WE REVEAL OUR MOST DEEPLY HELD PRIORITIES IN CRAFTING THE STATE'S BUDGET. USING A TRAILER BILL AS AN END AROUND OUR POLICY COMMITTEES PARTITE IS ONLY CONVENIENCE OVER CONSTITUENTS I URGE A NO VOTE ON SB NINETY TWO.

BAKER MEMBERS I STAND RESENT AJ ARE TOO WHICH CALLS UPON CONGRESS AND THE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY TO TAKE ALL MEASURES NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE DDG DUMPING SITE NEAR CATALINA ISLAND FROM CAUSING FURTHER HARM TO OUR OCEANS AND CALIFORNIANS CITIZENS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN CITIZENS FROM USE SCIENTISTS FROM UC SANTA BARBARA PUBLISHED THEIR FINDINGS FROM A MULTI YEAR EXAMINATION OF A SITE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR JUST NORTH OF CATALINA ISLAND. THEY DISCOVERED SOMETHING THAT HAD ONLY BEEN RUMORED BEFORE A TOXIC WASTE DUMPING SITE WHERE BARRELS FILLED WITH DDT LACED SLUDGE WERE BARGED OUT OVER THE OPEN OCEAN AND TOSSED INTO THE WATER. IN SOME INSTANCES THE BERYL'S APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN FIRST STRUCK WITH AN AXE BY THOSE ORIGINALLY DISPOSING OF THEM TO ENSURE THEY WOULD SINK TO THE OCEAN FLOOR. A PRACTICE THAT NEARLY GUARANTEED THEIR CONTENTS WOULD SEEP OUT INTO THE SURROUNDING WATERS. A RECENT SURVEY OF THE SITE DISCOVERED OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND BARRELS OF WASTE WITH POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS MORE BURIED BENEATH SAND. ON THE OCEAN FLOOR. IN ORDER TO BE PROPERTY STEWARDS OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES WE MUST WRESTLE WITH THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST AND ADDRESS THE DAMAGE BEFORE IT GETS WORSE. DDT IS BAD STUFF. IT HARMS WILDLIFE AND HUMAN LIFE. AG ARE TWO CALLS UPON OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO STOP THE HARM THE SITE CONTINUES TO FLEX INFLICT UPON CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENTS AND WILDLIFE AND OF COURSE COAST. THANK YOU MR O'DONNELL MISTER MURATSUCHI ON THE RESOLUTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO JOIN. MISTER O'DONNELL AND CALLING OUT. THIS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CRIME THIS- INCIDENT IS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES IF WE COULD SEE EITHER IN TODAY OR YESTERDAY'S NEW YORK TIMES THIS IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SCALE OF THE NUMBER OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BARRELS OF DDT THEY'RE JUST JUMPED OFF THE BEAUTIFUL COAST OF IN MY DISTRICT OFF OF THE PALACE VERDES PENINSULA IT OUT FOR FOLKS THAT EVER BEEN TO PALACE BIRDIES IF YOU TAKE A- DRIVE ALONG GOOD AT PCH DRIVE YOU SEE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CULTS OF DEALS VIEWS IN THE ENTIRE STATE. BUT UNDERLYING ALL THAT WATER THAT BEAUTIFUL COAST ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DDT BARRELS AND THERE'S A WHOLE LAYER OF DDT JUST SITTING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN THAT'S GETTING INTO OUR FOOD SUPPLY THAT'S THREATENING NOT JUST THE WILDLIFE THAT THREATENING OUR CHILDREN OUR FAMILIES SO WE NEED TO CALL OUT THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES THE U. S. EPA TO PROSECUTE THIS AS- FOR WHAT IT IS A ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME. THANK YOU MISS REYES WHO G. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING% RECOGNITION ON THE RESOLUTION MISTER O'DONNELL YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM TORRANCE WHO OFTEN SERVES IN THE VERY WATERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW AND ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THIS DALY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AB EIGHT OH FOUR AS A SIMPLE BILL THAT ESSENTIALLY CHANGES I MADE TO A SHALL IN CURRENT LAW TO REQUIRE RATHER THAN AUTHORIZE THE DEPART THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO DECLARE TO FREE HUNTING DAYS ONE IN THE FALL AND ONE IN THE SPRING. THIS WILL REDUCE FINANCIAL BARRIERS AND INCREASE ACCESS TO OUTDOOR SPORTS AND RECREATION FOR CALIFORNIANS THERE IS NO OPPOSITION AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS DAVIS TO BIGELOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT OH FOUR WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO ESTABLISH TO FREE HUNTING DAYS A YEAR. CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN A STEADY DECLINE IN SALES OF HUNTING LICENCES. WHICH IS CONCERNING SENSE CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE FUNDED THROUGH THE SALES. HUNTERS ARE NECESSARY ALSO FOR KEEPING ANIMAL POPULATIONS AT A HEALTHY LEVEL. BY ENCOURAGING EXPERIENCED HUNTERS TO MENTOR NEW ONES WE CAN FURTHER OUR NATIONAL GOAL OF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. WHILE INCREASING FUNDING TOWARDS OUR CONSERVATION EFFORTS I THINK IT'S WELL WORTH NOTING THAT. THE HUNTERS TODAY AS THEY HAVE DIMINISHED FROM ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND ANNUALLY TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE WITH THE DOLLARS THAT THEY ARE CHARGED FOR THEIR LICENSE AND FOR THE TAGS THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE TO GO IN FRONT AND ANIMAL. THIS IS IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE LOST OR CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE UP IN SOME WAY. THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IT'S IT TEACH PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE AND RESPECTFUL WAY. TO USE THEIR FIREARM WHILE TAKING AN ANIMAL. THANK YOU MEMBERS I ENCOURAGE A STRONG AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BELA. SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

AB TWO SIXTY THREE THE HEALTH OVERSIGHT AND LEADERSHIP AND ATTENTION ACT TAKES STEPS TO HELP TO CLARIFY THAT ALL PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES. IN THE STATE MUST ABIDE BY STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT HOLDING PRIVATE OPERATORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES THAT IMPACT PUBLIC HEALTH. THE BILL ALSO EMPOWERS OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND PROVIDES THEM WITH CLEAR FRAMEWORK TO SECURE OUR STATE. WE NEED THEIR LEADERSHIP NOW MORE THAN EVER AND THIS BILL MAKES THEIR JOB EASIER. AT PRESENT CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SEVEN PRIVATELY OPERATED CIVIL DETENTION FACILITIES THAT HAVE A CAPACITY TO HOLD UP TO SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THESE FACILITIES POSE A UNIQUE AND CRITICAL CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND OVER THE LAST YEAR HAVE BEEN THE SITE OF MASSIVE OUTBREAKS. WHILE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE COVERT NINETEEN IN PRIVATE DETENTION ARE DIRE FOR THOSE WHO ARE DETAINED. IT SHOULD BE OF GRAVE CONCERN GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THIS POTENTIAL OUTBREAK HOUSE FOR CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE. OUTBREAKS IN THESE FACILITIES CAN QUICKLY OVERWHELM LOCAL HOSPITALS AND DRAIN MEDICAL RESOURCES THREATENING COMMUNITY HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. CIVIL DETENTION FACILITIES THAT HOUSE IMMIGRANTS HAVE REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR FEDERAL CONTRACTS WITH RESPECT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. THIS INCLUDES LANGUAGE REQUIRING EACH FACILITY TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT AND FUTURE PLANS IMPLEMENTED BY FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES ADDRESSING SPECIFIC PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THIS WOULD INCLUDE PLANS FOR TESTING OR VACCINATIONS FOR COVERT NINETEEN TO HELP US MITIGATE THE SPREAD INSIDE THESE FACILITIES. BY CLARIFYING THAT ALL PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES IN THE STATE MUST ABIDE BY STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS AB TWO SIXTY THREE INSURERS STATEWIDE COORDINATION THAT IS NEEDED TO SECURE OUR STATE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC.
