EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:27.504
DATA TO BACK IT UP BECAUSE IT'S

00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:28.505

THE TO PROPERTY SEVEN WHICH IS

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:49.760
GOOD -- BUT I GUESS IS THE SENSE

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:51.695
OF HOW TO WE RESPOND IN A GUEST

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:52.863

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.233
QUESTION LIKE A PRETTY THIS

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.668
MONEY WOULD BE GETTING OUT OF IT --

00:43:57.735 --> 00:44:00.237
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE

AROUND ONE OF THE HIGHEST

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:57.327
POPULATIONS OF THOSE THAT HAS --

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:59.229
PROGRAMS A MEN OF COLOR THOSE

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:05.202
COLLECTING THE DATA THERE'S SO

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:07.137

GET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION --

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:14.044
SO WE ARE -- WE'RE ACTUALLY IN

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:16.814
THE PROCESS OF BEGINNING THOSE

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.516
CONVERSATIONS I'M A LOT OF

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:20.884

WORKFORCE DOLLARS GO DIRECTLY TO

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.062
TRAVEL GOVERNMENT SO THEY DON'T

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:42.673
IT'S IT'S HARD FOR US SOMETIMES

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.274
OR YOU KNOW ACTUALLY SOMETIMES

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:45.642

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:48.378
COUNTING -- SOME OF THOSE

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:49.680
OUTCOMES BECAUSE THEY MAY BE

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:51.515
DIVERT BEING DIRECTLY REPORTED

THE FEDERAL FUNDING STREAMS

00:45:55.552 --> 00:45:56.887

VERY TINY GRANT -- THAT GO TO

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:20.944

FEDS AND EVEN IF IT GOES

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:33.457

KNOW ABOUT IT ALSO -- AS A STATE

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:41.465
WORKFORCE BOARD SO THAT WE CAN

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:43.500

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:45.569
EQUITY IN AND GOOD OUTCOMES IN

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:46.036

EARTH -- AND ALSO -- VERY

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.657
EXCITED -- TO KNOW THAT THERE'S

OF THOSE YOU CAN GET INTO THE

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:12.502
PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:13.536
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- BECAUSE

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:14.437
LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW WE WE OFTEN

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:16.339
SAY EVERYBODY'S NOT GOING TO

THEY JUST DIDN'T MEET THAT

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:25.935
CRITERIA THAT WAS SET.

NOT MEETING THOSE.

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:40.483
CRITERIA IS AND THE FACT THAT

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:41.985
WE'RE LEAVING SIX MILLION

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:43.753
DOLLARS ON THE TABLE FOR THIS

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.921
VERY IMPORTANT WORK.

IS INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW WE

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.192
GET THAT ON THE GROUND

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.560
PARTICULARLY THE THE GROUPS ARE

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:52.896
HERE DOING THE REAL WORK AND THE

00:58:52.962 --> 00:58:53.963
EXPENSE OF NETWORKS THAT THEY

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:54.364
HAVE.

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.299
AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SO THAT

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.667
WOULD BE ONE QUESTION.

00:58:57.734 --> 00:58:58.968
I DID WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT THE

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.970
PUBLIC POLICIES TO CALIFORNIA

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:02.739
RECENTLY CAME OUT WITH A REPORT.

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:04.240
AS THEY WOULD CLAIM IS BECAUSE

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:07.110
THE FIRST DEEP DIVE.

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:10.780
LOOKING AT BOTH -- REALIGNMENT --

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:11.981
ONE ONLINE AND PROP FORTY SEVEN

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:12.582
AGAIN COULD ANY OF YOU MAYBE

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:13.716
COME ELABORATE ON SOME OF THAT

00:59:13.783 --> 00:59:15.518
AND HOW IT TIES INTO.

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:16.653
SOME OF THE FUNDING -- THAT

00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:18.221
YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED HERE IN THIS

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:20.723
FIRST THE FIRST THE PANEL. TO

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.325
SORT OF OR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:24.193
OFFICE SO YOU ARE RIGHT PP I SEE

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.230
HAS DONE -- A LOOK AT PROP FORTY

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:28.932
SEVEN IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:30.233
REALIGNMENT TO SEE.

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.135
THE EXTENT TO WHICH OF THOSE

00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:34.671
MEASURES CONTRIBUTED TO CHANGES

00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:35.939
IN CRIME IN CALIFORNIA.

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:37.607
AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY DID IS

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:38.975
THEY TRIED.

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:40.944
PROJECT WHAT CRIME IN CALIFORNIA

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:42.245
WOULD HAVE DONE IF THOSE

00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:43.780
MEASURES WEREN'T PASSED BY

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:46.282
LOOKING AT STATES OTHER STATES.

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:48.251
THAT HAD SIMILAR CRIME PATTERNS

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.953
TO CALIFORNIA BUT DIDN'T HAVE A

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:53.690
MEASURE LIKE PROP FORTY SEVEN OF

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:55.258
THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT.

00:59:55.325 --> 00:59:57.360
HOUSE AND IN THEIR ANALYSIS THEY

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:59.095
FOUND THAT -- PROP FORTY SEVEN

00:59:59.162 --> 00:59:59.729
IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.264
DID NOT APPEAR TO CONTRIBUTE TO

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.166
ANY INCREASES IN CRIME IN

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:06.235
CALIFORNIA -- THEY DID FIND SOME

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:08.071
EVIDENCE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:09.339
THOSE MEASURES MAY HAVE

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.674
CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:14.844
AUTO THEFTS -- BUT NO NO THEY

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.312
WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE ARE THEY

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:17.647
WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:18.648
ANY OTHER.

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.350
INCREASES IN CRIME I WILL SAY

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:23.286
THAT SOME OF THE CRITICS OF PROP

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:26.422
FORTY SEVEN HAVE ARGUED THAT --

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:28.257
CRIMES AREN'T BEING REPORTED --

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.625
AND SO THEY WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:31.127
DESPITE THE EVIDENCE CRIME IS

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:32.895
GOING UP BUT BECAUSE THERE'S NO

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.397
WAY TO ASSESS WHETHER THAT'S THE

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:35.999
CASE BECAUSE IT'S A LACK OF DATA

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:37.066
RATHER THAN DATA.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:40.536
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ASSESS

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:42.338
WHETHER WHETHER THAT'S TRUE.

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.139
GOT A QUESTION REGARDS TO THE

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:46.242

THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS.

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:54.650
ARE THEY THE SAME CENTERS ARE

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.586
THAT WE'VE HAD FOR SOME TIME I'M

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:59.088

CENTER AND NEEDS UP AND DOWN THE

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.927
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING THAT

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:07.330
THERE IS A STRONG -- ASSERTIVE

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:11.134
EFFORT TO TRY TO FUND THE

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.936

EARLIER THAT PROGRAM STARTED

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:17.373
TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THAT

MONEY KICKED IN.

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:21.310
AND SO IT ORIGIN IT WAS JUST A

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:23.513
HANDFUL OF LOCATIONS -- WHEN

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:26.082

AND THIS VERY UNIQUE ORGANIZING

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:37.533
MODEL IS ONE THAT IS -- BEING

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.868
PARTICULARLY -- EXAMINED BY

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.437
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:43.372
THE MY BROTHER'S KEEPER ALLIANCE

THE COUNTRY -- THIS MODEL ONLY

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:51.714
CURRENTLY EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.048
WHERE YOU HAVE ORGANIZING

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.984
HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IN THE

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:55.951
GRASS ROOTS.

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:57.386
IN THE LEGISLATURE AND AMONG

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:59.388
FUNDERS -- BUT OTHERS ARE TAKING

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:02.224
NOTE STATES LIKE LOUISIANA AND

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:04.026
FLORIDA ARE TRYING TO MAYOR WHAT

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.028
WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED -- THIS

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.063
STRATEGY.

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.898
IS ALSO BEING REPLICATED FOR

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:11.533
OTHER POPULATIONS WHICH I THINK

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.602
IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- GIRLS

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.037
AND WOMEN OF COLOR ARE BEGINNING

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.271
BEGINNING TO ORGANIZE IN THE

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:17.272
SAME WAY.

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:18.474
AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.377
EFFORTS -- BECAUSE OUR ULTIMATE

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:24.513
END GOAL IS JUSTICE -- AND THAT

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.948
IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL SHARE.

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:26.982
THE FUTURE OF THE MOVEMENT FOR

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:28.317
THE BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR WORK

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.852
IN CALIFORNIA IS A BRIGHT.

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:31.153
ONE OUR NETWORK HAS FOUND COMMON

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.688
CAUSE WITH THE CONSOLATION OF

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.757
LEADERS THAT FULLY REPRESENT A

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.825
BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES -- FACING

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:38.360
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALL OVER

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:39.461
THE STATE.

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:40.963
IN ADDITION HE WORK HAS

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.898
EXPANDED BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.833
SET OF ISSUES THAT -- ARE

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.368
COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AS

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:46.969
CHALLENGES FOR BOYS AND MEN OF

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:47.770
COLOR.

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.271
SO RECENTLY THE ALLIANCE'S

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:50.873
CENTERED AND PRIORITIZE WORK

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.141
FOCUSED ON ENDING VIOLENCE

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:55.577
AGAINST WOMEN COMBATING MISOGYNY.

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:57.312
AND DISMANTLING PATRIARCHY.

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:58.580
WE GOT INTO THIS WORK BECAUSE

01:11:58.647 --> 01:11:59.982
THAT EXPERIENCE MEN WERE FACING

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:01.250
WITH VIOLENCE.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.918
AT THE TIME THE ONLY WAY THAT WE

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.219
WERE LOOKING AT THIS WAS TO THE

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:05.854
THE ANGLE OF SEEING MEN AS

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:07.222
VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE.

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:10.359
LOOKING AT LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.160
MEN.

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:12.327
BUT THEN AS WE STARTED TO GET

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:13.762
DEEPER INTO UNDERSTANDING

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.497
VIOLENCE WE WE COULDN'T WALK

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:17.966
AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT -- IN

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.568
CERTAIN INSTANCES MEN WERE

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:20.903
CAUSING HARM.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.571
AND THAT HARM THAT THEY WERE

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.273
CAUSING WAS PART OF UNRESOLVED

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:25.641
TRAUMA.

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.342
AND SO WE HAD TO GET AT THE ROOT

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:28.544
CAUSE OF THAT.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:29.812
SO WE'RE ADVANCING POLICIES AND

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.013
PROGRAMS THAT WILL ADDRESS THESE

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.816
ISSUES.

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.384
THIS TYPE OF LEARNING COMES FROM

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:36.618
A DEEP RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:37.586

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:39.354

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:41.256
WITH LEGISLATORS -- AND THE

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:42.791
WILLINGNESS OF FUNDERS AND

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:45.494
OTHERS -- TO WALK WITH US ON

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:47.096
EXPLORING THESE ISSUES.

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:49.131

ALL ON THIS.

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:26.388
THAT'S THE STORY OF BOYS AND MEN

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:27.756
THE GOVERNOR IS IN IT.

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:28.924
BACK THEN THEY DIDN'T WANT A

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.826
GERMAN WE STARTED THIS WORK IT

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:32.461
WAS LIKE ALL YOU CAN DO IS YOUR

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:37.866
RIVERS RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.701
ABOUT WERE BURIED OUR BOYS.

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:42.871
THERE'S NOTHING WHAT IS WHAT IS.

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:43.772
HE SAID HE SAYS TO ME THAT IS

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:46.341
UNACCEPTABLE ONE OF THE BOARD OF

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:48.577
SUPERVISORS IN MY TOWN.

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:49.845
IN MY COUNTY NICE TO WHAT'S

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:50.746
UNACCEPTABLE BUT SAVE IN OUR

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.981
KIDS LIVES.

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:53.582
WELL THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:56.919
RIGHT NOW WE STARTED THIS WORK A

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:57.519
TWO ONE THEY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:15:57.586 --> 01:15:58.453
YOU CHAIRMAN AND THE SELECT

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.022
COMMITTEE FOR JUST ALLOW ME TO

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:01.089
JUST BREATHE A LITTLE BIT AND

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:01.990
SAY THAT ABOUT THAT MUCH.

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.392
OF ABOUT MY NEPHEW BRANDON

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:03.992
HARRISON MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:05.260
AND ALL THE YOUNG MEN WHO ARE

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.295
STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW AND HANG

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:09.498
HANG ON OUR DECISIONS RIGHT NOW.

01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:11.433
HOW OLD ARE WE GOING TO BE?

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.801
IS A RADICAL TO THINK THAT OUR

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:13.468
YOUNG MEN DESERVE BETTER AND ALL

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:14.703
I DON'T THINK SO.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.071
I THINK IT'S REALLY WE NEED A

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.072
BAND THAT ARC OF JUSTICE WE NEED

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:18.240
TO MOVE IT.

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:19.241
SO WE STARTED THIS WORK ONE

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:20.642
BEFORE THAT WAS AN ALLIANCE WE

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:21.209
STARTED WITH THIS WELL AS HE

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:21.476
DOES NOW.

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:22.611
AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.079
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT THE TIME THAT

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:25.013
CO FOUNDED THIS FROM THE

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.448
COACHELLA VALLEY SO WE'VE ALWAYS

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:28.183
HAD THIS CAN SHIP RELATIONSHIP.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.685
BECAUSE IN THE END AND PART OF

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:30.852
THE STATE THE BACKBONE

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:32.020
CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHERE THE MASS

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:34.089
INCARCERATION REALLY TOOK SHAPE.

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:35.958
AND WE WERE LOCKING UP BOYS AND

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:37.292
MEN FOR THE MOST RIDICULOUS OF

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.628
THINGS SO WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:40.529
THE ANALYTICS LET'S GO BACK A

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:41.430
LITTLE BIT.

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:42.931
AND REALIZE THE COMPLEXITIES OF

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:44.967
REALITIES THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.602
FORCED OUR YOUNG MEN AND JUST

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:48.904
SURVIVE.

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:49.438
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY'RE

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:50.439
TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW JUST

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:51.340
SURVIVE BUT THEN WHEN THE LIGHTS

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:52.874
CAME UP I FELT LIKE IT WAS -- IT

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:53.775
IT REALLY TRANSCENDED ANY SINGLE

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:55.711
ISSUE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE AT THE

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.045
HEART OF ANY IS ONE SINGLE ONE

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:58.347
OF THESE ISSUES YOU GO FIVE BOYS

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:00.248
AND MEN OF COLOR AT THE ACTUAL

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:01.350
CENTER PIECE OF THIS.

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:02.718
SO WHEN WE STARTED THIS WORK ONE

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:03.719
BEFORE THAT WAS ACTUAL ON THE

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:06.755
LIGHTS FORM THE IDEOLOGY OF THIS

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:09.124
WORK WE MET AND WE START TALKING

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.826
WITH ELDERS YOUNG ORGANIZERS AND

01:17:10.892 --> 01:17:11.626
AND FOLKS THAT WE'RE DOING

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:12.694
HEALING WORK AND WE BROUGHT IT

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:13.829
ALL TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY MADE

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:16.298
SOME GUMBEL OUT OF IT.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.033
AND HERE WE ARE TODAY.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:18.667
WHERE WE ARE TODAY SO EVERYONE

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:19.201
CAN FEED FROM THIS RIGHT

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:20.669
EVERYONE HAS A PLACE OF THE

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:23.472
TABLE SO I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT?

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.307
THE THE WORK IN STOCKTON HAS

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:26.908
BENEFITTED TREMENDOUSLY BY THIS

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:27.876
WORK IN YOUR BODY AT YOUR

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:29.444
DECISIONS STOCKTON HAS BEEN

01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:30.912
TRANSFORMED STOCK AND AT ONE

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:32.447
POINT WAS THE MORTGAGE MELTDOWN

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.016
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD IT WAS THE

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:34.916
LARGEST METROPOLITAN CITY TO

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:35.817
FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY.

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:37.519
IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:38.720
THE WORLD.

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:39.588
IT WAS ACTUALLY A STATE WHERE

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:40.689
YOU AT A HIGHER IT WAS THE CITY

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:41.957
WE GOT A HIGHER CHANCE OF

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:43.692
GETTING SHOT MURDERED.

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:46.628
THEN YOU DID IN CHICAGO OR IRAQ

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:47.896
AT THE TIME.

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.031
AND THERE WAS WE CAME AND

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.232
PLEADED WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:51.366
OF SCHOOL SUSPENSION WE HAVE THE

01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:53.101
HIGHEST RATE POLICING IN SCHOOL

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:54.202
THAN CITATIONS GIVEN TO YOUNG

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:55.737
PEOPLE OF COLOR SO MUCH SO.

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.406
THAT THE DEAL J. ACTUALLY JUST

01:17:57.472 --> 01:17:58.006
SETTLE WITH OUR DISTRICT AND

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:59.341
SAID THOSE POLICIES WERE

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:00.675
DISCRIMINATORY.

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:02.644
THERE WERE RACES POLICIES WHAT

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:04.112
THEY SAID SO HOW DO YOU HILL

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:04.846
FROM RACISM GOT A KNOWLEDGE OF

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:05.881
FIRST.

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:06.882
WE GOT A KNOWLEDGE OF WE'RE

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:08.083
GOING TO HEAL FROM IT FIRST.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:09.117
AND THOSE WERE POLICIES BORN OF

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:10.052
THE SPIRIT TREATMENT IN THE

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:11.520
COLLECTED DIRECTLY TARGETED OUR

01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:13.655
PEOPLE SO AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:14.589
THE HOUSING MARKET THE VIOLENCE

01:18:14.656 --> 01:18:15.057
RATE.

01:18:15.123 --> 01:18:16.591
THE EDUCATION HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.826
RATE OF ILLITERACY SO WHAT IS

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:20.095
THE ANSWER TO THAT CAN YOU

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:21.763
LEGISLATE LOVE.

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:22.864
GOOD WE'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:23.498
ABOUT LEGISLATING HATE IN THE

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:24.833
STATE BUT I SEE IT HAPPENING NOW

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:25.467
WHEN THERE'S EVIDENCE OF THAT

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.002
MIGHT WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:28.003
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:29.237
SEEING IS THAT SOME OF THE

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:30.405
THINGS THAT YOU ALL TALKED ABOUT

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:32.941
WE'RE REALLY RESONATED WITH US

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:34.609
BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW ON

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:35.577
THE GROUND.

01:18:35.644 --> 01:18:37.479
IS THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TAKING A

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.314
LOT OF THIS THE WORK THAT YOU'RE

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.450
DOING AND TRANSFORMING OUR CITY

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:42.984
WE HAVE THE YOUNGEST AND FIRST

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:45.620
BLACK MAYOR IN OUR CITY THAT WAS

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:45.854
REALLY.

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:46.688
AREN'T OR GALVANIZING POINT IN

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:49.424
OUR CITY WE ARE ACTUALLY ONE OF

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:50.525
ELEVEN TOM RECOVERY CENTERS AND

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:51.893
HAVE AN EXCELLENT TRACK RECORD

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.229
TO PROVIDE THE HEALING SERVICES.

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:55.397
TO THE YOUNG MEN OF COLOR IN

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.332
PARTICULAR WHO MAKE UP

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.401
CONSTITUTE THE HIGHEST RATE OF

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:03.872
BY THAT GUN BY THE HOMICIDES THE

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:05.240
QUESTION HOW MANY OF RECEIVED.

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:08.076
IMPERATIVE HEALING SERVICES NONE.

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.244
THE REACTION FROM THE STATE HAS

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:10.645
BEEN INCARCERATION IN AND

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:11.546
POLICING.

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.482
AND THIS ACTUAL BODY AT THAT

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:14.382
POINT TEN YEARS AGO WAS

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:15.584
RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THAT

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:16.651
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE STATE

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:18.386
BUDGET WAS AT AND NOW WE

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:20.355
ACTUALLY WHISPERING A UNIVERSITY

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:21.556
IN STOCKTON.

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.091
THERE'S WHISPERS OF THAT RIGHT

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:23.725
NOW SO IT'S GOING TO BE

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.794
INTERESTING AND THAT WASN'T

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:26.995
POSSIBLE BEFORE.

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:29.498
AS A YOUNG MAN I WILL SAY THIS

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:30.632
THAT ARE AT FIVE YEARS OLD I

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:33.401
STOOD UP TO DOMESTIC COULD TO

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:34.836
VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.004
AT THIRTEEN YEARS OLD PUSHED OUT

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:36.972
OF SCHOOL FIFTEEN YEARS ON THE

01:19:37.038 --> 01:19:37.973
CLOSER TO JUVENILE HALL EVERY

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.141
SINGLE TIME ONE OF THESE MODES

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:40.742
ISSUES HAPPEN I WISH SOMEBODY

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:41.743
WAS THERE.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:42.644
I WISH SOMEBODY WAS THERE

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:43.745
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MAN THERE

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:45.013
MIGHT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD MOMS

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.348
WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS JUST

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:47.682
TO TRY TO SURVIVE.

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:49.017
ALL THE MEN HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.252
BECAUSE THE WAND WOODS OF WAR

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:51.553
GETS MY COMMUNITY.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.888
SO ALL THE MEN WERE GONE.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.656
SO WE HAD TO FEND FOR OURSELVES

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:56.258
AND ORGANIZE OURSELVES.

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.792
AND SO EVERY SINGLE TIME WHEN I

01:19:57.859 --> 01:20:00.962
WAS LIKE THIRTEEN YEARS OLD

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:01.763
FIFTEEN YEARS OLD CAN

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:02.831
INCARCERATED BY THE TIME I

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:04.099
BECAME A FATHER I WANTED

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.001
SOMEBODY TO HELP ME HOW DO I

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.702
BECOME A GOOD FATHER.

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:09.271
I DON'T HAVE ANY EXAMPLES.

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:11.773
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.109
AND SO I WAS SOMEBODY WAS THERE.

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:15.443
AFTERWARDS I GOT SHOT WITH A

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.044
TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN LEFT FOR

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:17.179
DEAD.

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:19.381
I WISH SOMEBODY WAS THERE FOR ME.

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.349
AFTERWARDS HAD CUT INCARCERATED

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.051
MYSELF BECAUSE HOW DO YOU NOT

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.085
HOW DO YOU STAY CLEAN IN A MUD

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:25.153
PUDDLE AS THEY SAY RIGHT.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.322
THE REALITY IS IS THAT THE

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:28.356
GENERATIONAL RESPECTFUL

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:30.592
RECIPROCAL FORM OF VIOLENCE THAT

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.060
HAD GRIPPED OUR CITY GRIPPED OUR

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:33.495
NEIGHBORHOOD WAS REAL AND WAS

BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER AS THE

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.145
STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:51.446

CONTROL MODEL THAT HAS REALLY

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:10.532
PUSH SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE OF

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:01.775
ALL GOT HERE AND WE KNOW THIS

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:03.177

FROM FEAR.

01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:09.650
WE WE WORK THROUGHOUT THE

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:11.585

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.461
AND AND SO THE WORK THAT WE'RE

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:22.329
DOING REALLY IS IS HOW DO WE

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:23.797
BUILD CAPACITY IN PART OF

BUILDING CAPACITY IS WE HAVE TO

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:26.400
CHALLENGE THE SYSTEMS.

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:27.901

THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND AS OUR

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:38.679
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS OVER

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:41.048
MEDICATED AND AND AND AND OVER

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:42.950
DIAGNOSED OUR KIDS SO IT'S NOT

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:44.184
JUST ABOUT GIVING MORE FUNDS.

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.086
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING MORE

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:47.121
SOCIAL SERVICES NOT JUST YOU

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:48.856

ENCOURAGES SOME OF THE OTHER

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:52.092
PROGRAMS THAT DO THEIR OWN

01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:53.794
INTERNAL KEELING WORK INTO THEIR

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:54.762
OWN.

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:56.196
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS WORK AND RE

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:58.632
TRANSFORM EVERYTHING THAT ALL WE

01:38:58.699 --> 01:39:00.501
DO IS REPLICATING THE OPPRESSION.

01:39:00.567 --> 01:39:03.437
WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN SCHOOLS.

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:04.405
AND WE'RE FINDING IS SCHOOLS THE

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:06.940
BREEDING GROUND FOR MANY TIMES

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:08.375
THE THE LACK OF INTEGRITY THE

01:39:08.442 --> 01:39:09.476
KIDS HAVE.

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:11.245
BEGIN TO ASSIMILATE THEM INTO A

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:12.579
PROCESS AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.381
IS IS GOOD BUT IF YOU'RE NOT

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:16.050

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:22.423
ALL WE'RE DOING IS BANDAID.

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:25.826
SO WE IN OUR PROCESS WOULD WE

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:27.928
LIFT UP IS CHALLENGING SYSTEMS

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:29.530
TRANSFORMING SYSTEMS AND WE HAVE

01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:31.065

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:18.379
AROUND THESE KIDS WE'RE SEEING

01:40:18.445 --> 01:40:19.646

AND AND SOMEBODY WAS ASKING OKAY

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:37.064
SO AS THE CRIME RATE GOING UP

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:38.966
WHAT THE CRIME ISGONE UP THAT

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:40.567
THAT'S THAT'S THE IMPLICATION ON

01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:42.803
THE SYSTEM THEY DIDN'T DO GOOD

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:44.505
BY THEM WHEN THEY'RE INSIDE.

01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:45.205

DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR PAIN.

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:36.690
WE HAVE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:37.724
THAT IS STILL STRUGGLING WITH

01:41:37.791 --> 01:41:39.827
THEIR OWN TRAUMA AND THEY'RE NOT

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:41.595
ABLE TO CONNECT WITH US THEY'RE

01:41:41.662 --> 01:41:43.163
NOT ABLE TO GUIDE TO NURTURE US

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:44.498
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT HEALED

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:45.899
THEIR GENERATIONAL PAIN.

01:41:45.966 --> 01:41:48.168

STRUGGLE TO ADAPT TO RAPIDLY

01:41:51.972 --> 01:41:54.508
CHANGING DIVISIVE MILITARISTIC

01:41:54.575 --> 01:41:56.610
SOCIAL WORLD THAT EXPECTS A LOT

01:41:56.677 --> 01:41:58.078
FROM US.

01:41:58.145 --> 01:41:59.713

NOT PROVIDE GUIDANCE NURTURANCE

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:04.418
OR EVEN A SPACE FOR US TO BE.

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:06.153
AND WE OVERWHELMINGLY GOT FROM

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:09.723
THEM WE NEED A PLACE TO BE.

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:11.592
JUST TO BE.

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:13.794
WE WANTED PLACE TO BE WHAT WE

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:15.829
COULD FEEL SAFE WITH IS GETTING

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:17.664
OLD STORES IN ELLE'S ELDERS IN

01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:18.298
THERE.

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:19.900
THAT WE CAN TALK TO THE WE CAN

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.336
ASK ABOUT HOW DO WE CROSS THIS

01:42:22.402 --> 01:42:24.371
RITES OF PASSAGE BRIDGE.

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:25.506
AND THE OTHER THINGS THEY SAID

01:42:25.572 --> 01:42:28.175
SYSTEMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CIVIC

01:42:28.242 --> 01:42:29.643
AND HEALTH CARE THAT.

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:31.245
THAT THAT ARE CONNECTED TO WITH

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.579
THAT DON'T DISCONNECT US FROM

01:42:32.646 --> 01:42:34.114
WHO WE ARE AND DON'T PUNISH THIS

01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:35.249
FOR BEINGWHO WE ARE.

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:37.618
SO THEY STRUGGLE FROM THE TRAUMA

01:42:37.684 --> 01:42:38.752
AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:40.621
THEY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HOW DO

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:42.089

ON LOT OF US JUST WILL BATES

01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:49.229
SMOKE SOME WEED.

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:50.764
YOU KNOW JUST TRY LISTEN TO

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:52.332
MUSIC TRYING AND AND AND

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:53.800
SOMETIMES IT COMES OUT WITH

THEIR WOUNDED MISS BEGINS TO

01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:57.504
WILL NOT.

01:42:57.571 --> 01:42:58.138
SO THAT THE VIOLENCE THE DRUGS

01:42:58.205 --> 01:43:00.007
THE ALCOHOL ALL OF THAT STUFF AS

01:43:00.073 --> 01:43:00.541
WELL.

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:03.877
AND AND SO PART OF OUR EMPHASIS

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:06.079
AND AND I WHAT I WANT TO LIFT UP --

01:43:06.146 --> 01:43:06.747
THE BROTHERHOOD OF ELDERS OUT OF

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:07.681

BRING MORE OF THAT COLLABORATION

01:43:31.338 --> 01:43:33.974
AND SO -- ONE OF ONE OF OUR

01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:36.810
FOCUSES IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS IS

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:38.345

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:53.126
FATHERS OF FAMILIES.

01:43:53.193 --> 01:43:54.494
YOU KNOW AND SO YOU CAN BUILD

01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:55.796
THAT KIND OF MODEL WHERE THE

01:43:55.862 --> 01:43:57.864
HEALING IS GOING ON INTERNALLY

01:43:57.931 --> 01:43:59.366
AND PLUS YOU BRING TRAUMA THAT I

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:00.901
SEE TO TRAUMA CENTERS BUT DOING

01:44:00.968 --> 01:44:02.336
TRAUMA CENTERS BY THEMSELVES.

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:04.805
SOMETIMES WE JUST RE EXACERBATE

01:44:04.871 --> 01:44:07.474
OF THE TRAUMA RIGHT SO SO I WANT

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:09.476
TO LIFT UP THE ASPECT OF HEALING

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:11.812
THAT WE NEED TO TO REALLY --

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:14.881
PLACE FUNDS AND SUPPORT EFFORTS

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:17.050
THAT ARE CULTURALLY BASED

01:44:17.117 --> 01:44:18.318
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR OWN

01:44:18.385 --> 01:44:19.753
HEALING CAPACITY IN OUR OWN

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.688
CULTURE THAT WE CAN LIFT UP THAT

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:23.590
WE CAN BUILD ON THAT IS TRAUMA

01:44:23.657 --> 01:44:28.095
INFORMED AND NOW EVERYTHING IS

01:44:28.161 --> 01:44:28.996
FROM INFORMED.

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:29.630

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:30.731
A RACIST WAY AS WELL.

01:44:30.797 --> 01:44:32.866

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:54.741
TEACHERS THAT.

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:56.109
ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:58.878
WHERE THEY COME FROM THE

01:51:58.945 --> 01:52:00.280
STRUGGLES THAT THEY HAVE TO GO

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:01.448

SOME OF YOUR INVOLVED WITH IT

01:56:59.879 --> 01:57:02.148
BECAUSE I AS CHAIR OF THE THE

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:03.649
PART THAT PART OF THE BUDGET I

01:57:03.716 --> 01:57:05.184
INSISTED THAT THERE.

IS A COMMUNITY ADVISORY GROUP --

01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:09.322
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES FOLKS IN IN

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:10.690
EVEN IN THE CONVERSATION WANT TO

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:12.759
SIMPLY MOVE THE ONE AGENCY TO

01:57:12.825 --> 01:57:14.260
THE NEXT AGENCY.

01:57:14.327 --> 01:57:15.962
WITH THE SAME PEOPLE AND THE

01:57:16.028 --> 01:57:17.463
SAME KIND OF THING THAT'S TO

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:19.132
OCCUR AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:21.601
THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU TALKED

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:22.168
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:23.069
DEEPER.

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:24.437
OF AND IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:57:24.504 --> 01:57:26.105
ACTUALLY TRANSFORM OUR JUVENILE

01:57:26.172 --> 01:57:28.441
JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THAT IT DOES

01:57:28.508 --> 01:57:30.143
ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUES WE

01:57:30.209 --> 01:57:31.944
FACE RATHER THAN JUST SIMPLY

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:34.447
CHANGING THE LOCATION FROM WHICH

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:34.714
A PERSON.

01:57:34.781 --> 01:57:35.248
GETS A PAYCHECK.

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:36.949
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GIVEN

01:57:37.016 --> 01:57:38.618
ANY THOUGHT TO THAT ANY OF YOU

01:57:38.684 --> 01:57:40.453
ABOUT THAT -- BECAUSE WE ARE

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.687
PERFORMING THAT WAS IN THE

01:57:41.754 --> 01:57:43.189
BUDGET NAP INSISTED THAT IT BE

01:57:43.256 --> 01:57:45.091
THERE MAINLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T

01:57:45.158 --> 01:57:46.926
SEE THE DEEP CONVERSATIONS BUT

01:57:46.993 --> 01:57:48.761
SHOULD BE OCCURRING WHEN YOU

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:50.663
MAKE SUCH A MAJOR MOVES.

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:51.931
AND PEOPLE AT EXPECTATIONS BUT

01:57:51.998 --> 01:57:54.801
THERE WAS NO PLAN AND I WAS VERY

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:55.468
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S

01:57:55.535 --> 01:57:56.602
RIGHT.

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:58.638
UP THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION

01:57:58.704 --> 01:58:01.140
DOCTOR WEBER AND YOU KNOW AS AS

01:58:01.207 --> 01:58:02.608
SOMEONE WHO'S REPRESENTING --

01:58:02.675 --> 01:58:04.310
COMMUNITY OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:58:04.377 --> 01:58:06.245
HAVE -- POURED OVER THIS AT

01:58:06.312 --> 01:58:08.281
LENGTH -- YOU KNOW I I'D LIKE TO

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:10.016
ALSO SAY WE WE SHARE THOSE

01:58:10.082 --> 01:58:12.485
CONCERNS -- YOU KNOW I THINK THE

01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:13.886
ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF

01:58:13.953 --> 01:58:16.689
COLOR FIRMLY BELIEVES IN THE THE

01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:18.691
IN THE CLOSURE OF YOUTH PRESENCE --

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:21.127
WE BELIEVE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE --

01:58:21.194 --> 01:58:23.229
DO NOT NEED TO BE INCARCERATED --

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:26.699
AND WE WE SEE THIS TRANSITION AS

01:58:26.766 --> 01:58:28.267
SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP YOUNG

01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:31.137
PEOPLE -- BUT WITHOUT THE

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:35.107
OVERSIGHT WITHOUT THE DEDICATED

01:58:35.174 --> 01:58:36.843
KIND OF COMMITMENT TO SHRINKING

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:38.578
THE POPULATION WITHOUT ANY

01:58:38.644 --> 01:58:40.847
CONTROLS AROUND THE BUDGET -- WE

01:58:40.913 --> 01:58:42.815
ARE CONCERNED THAT IT COULD BE

01:58:42.882 --> 01:58:44.984
BUSINESS AS USUAL -- THAT

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:47.320
INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE VERY

01:58:47.386 --> 01:58:49.956
DEEP -- STRUCTURAL HARMS AND AND

01:58:50.022 --> 01:58:56.996
THE THE VERY DEEP -- BRACE

01:58:57.063 --> 01:58:58.097
RACISM THAT EXISTS THAT ALLOW SO

01:58:58.164 --> 01:58:58.731
MANY YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BE

01:58:58.798 --> 01:58:59.599
IN THAT PARTICULAR POSITION FOR

01:58:59.665 --> 01:59:01.200
THE SAME CRIMES THAT WHITE KIDS.

01:59:01.267 --> 01:59:04.036
COMMIT -- YOU KNOW WE STE WE

01:59:04.103 --> 01:59:06.606
BELIEVE THAT -- WE JUST NEED TO

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:08.374
DO AWAY WITH IT ALTOGETHER --

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:11.477
AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE WE STAND --

01:59:11.544 --> 01:59:13.546
IN IN THAT COMMUNITY OF CONCERN

01:59:13.613 --> 01:59:15.848
WITH YOU -- WE ARE THANKFUL FOR

01:59:15.915 --> 01:59:18.017
THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND FOR

01:59:18.084 --> 01:59:19.318
SOME MODICUM OF OVERSIGHT WE

01:59:19.385 --> 01:59:21.087
BELIEVE THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:22.855
STRENGTHENED WITH WE WOULD LOVE

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:24.790
TO SEE ON THE LEADERSHIP OF

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:26.792
PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED.

01:59:26.859 --> 01:59:29.428
BY DJJ -- AS PART OF THE

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:33.833
OVERSIGHT BODY -- WE WE WE HOPE

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:34.433
THAT WILL HAPPEN BUT WE DON'T

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.668
KNOW.

01:59:35.735 --> 01:59:36.636
AND I SAW I DON'T SEE A CULTURAL

01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:40.706
COMPONENT WHICH IS OF RIGHT.

01:59:40.773 --> 01:59:41.774
WHICH IS SOMETIMES SO ESSENTIAL.

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:43.843
TO UNDERSTAND THE THE YOUNG

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:45.144
PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE BUT MORE

01:59:45.211 --> 01:59:46.946
IMPORTANT AS YOU POINTED OUT.

01:59:47.013 --> 01:59:47.847
THE UNDERSTAND THE STRENGTH THAT

01:59:47.914 --> 01:59:49.282
COMES FROM UNDERSTANDING WHO YOU

01:59:49.348 --> 01:59:50.316
ARE.

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:52.552
AND I'VE VISITED OF THE JUVENILE

01:59:52.618 --> 01:59:54.654
JUSTICE SYSTEM IN GHANA ONCE AND

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.321
I WAS.

01:59:55.388 --> 01:59:57.390
I WAS OF A JUVENILE HALL SAYS

01:59:57.456 --> 01:59:58.858
SITUATION WHEN I WAS THE

01:59:58.925 --> 02:00:00.159
VISITING ONE OF MY TIMES AND AND

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:01.761
I WAS AMAZED AT THAT THE PREMISE

02:00:01.827 --> 02:00:03.729
UPON WHICH THE ORGANIZATION WAS

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:06.532
BUILT THAT WHEN KIDS ARE ARE.

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:07.867
ARE ARE PLACED IN THE JUVENILE

02:00:07.934 --> 02:00:09.235
JUSTICE SYSTEM OR DO SOMETHING

02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:11.237
THAT IS WRONG THEY HAVE TO GO

02:00:11.304 --> 02:00:13.005
BACK AND HE'LL THE FAMINE AND SO

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:14.073
MUCH OF THE EFFORT WAS TO TALK

02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:14.740
ABOUT.

02:00:14.807 --> 02:00:16.142
HEALING THE FAMILY BECAUSE IF

02:00:16.208 --> 02:00:17.843
THE FAMILY WORKED IN THE CULTURE

02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:19.812
WORKED THEN YOU'D GET THE

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:20.947
OUTCOME THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

02:00:21.013 --> 02:00:22.715
HAVE WHICH IS A RESPECTFUL

02:00:22.782 --> 02:00:24.550
ENGAGE YOUNG PERSON AND SO WHEN

02:00:24.617 --> 02:00:25.818
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:27.987
THEY GO BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:29.589
THEY DID WRONG WHAT WAS WHAT WAS

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:30.790
HAPPENING IN THE CULTURE THAT

02:00:30.856 --> 02:00:32.658
CAUSES YOUNG PERSON NOT TO

02:00:32.725 --> 02:00:33.259
RESPOND IN THE WAY THAT THEY

02:00:33.326 --> 02:00:34.226
SHOULD.

02:00:34.293 --> 02:00:36.429
A TO THE VALUES THAT WE IN THE

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:37.630
COMMUNITY ITSELF IT'S AN ON IT'S

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:38.931
IT'S QUITE A CHALLENGE BECAUSE

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:40.766
WE LIVE IN A KIND OF A SOCIETY

02:00:40.833 --> 02:00:42.501
THAT DOESN'T WE DON'T OPERATE ON

02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:43.402
VALUES.

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:44.770
YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T WE

02:00:44.837 --> 02:00:46.539
DON'T GIVE OUR KIDS THAT THE THE

02:00:46.606 --> 02:00:48.574
FEELING THAT YOU ARE NOW EIGHT

02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:51.010
WEBER AND THAT MEANS SOMETHING.

02:00:51.077 --> 02:00:53.846
YOU KNOW WE DON'T DO THAT AND SO.

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:55.014
UP YOU KNOW AND SO AS A RESULT

02:00:55.081 --> 02:00:56.749
THAT THAT THAT THAT PIECE IS

02:00:56.816 --> 02:00:57.883
BROKEN.

02:00:57.950 --> 02:01:00.853
IS NEVER PUT BACK AND THEY JUST

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.922
KIND OF BUMP AROUND WITHOUT A

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:04.357
ANCHOR -- DOUBLE GOAL THE DAY'S

02:01:04.423 --> 02:01:06.592

A FAMILY IN A COMMUNITY.

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:10.296

02:01:19.772 --> 02:01:20.139
SO.

02:01:20.206 --> 02:01:21.107
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

02:01:21.173 --> 02:01:22.541
ASKED TO HAVE THINGS COME BACK

02:01:22.608 --> 02:01:24.343
TO US SO THAT WE GET A CHANCE TO

02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:26.779
REALLY ASSESS -- WHAT IS

02:01:26.846 --> 02:01:30.149
HAPPENING IN WHETHER NOT IT'S

02:01:30.216 --> 02:01:30.616
REALLY GOING TO MAKE A

02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:30.916
DIFFERENCE?

02:01:30.983 --> 02:01:32.084
IT'S ALSO ARE CONCERNED WITH

02:01:32.151 --> 02:01:33.352
THAT AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK

02:01:33.419 --> 02:01:41.494
THAT YOU KNOW THE THE SYSTEM THE

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:42.595
SYSTEM.

02:01:42.662 --> 02:01:43.729
REALLY HAVE NOT.

02:01:43.796 --> 02:01:44.363
BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS HELPED

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:45.665
US TO TO REALIZE THAT THE TRUE

02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:46.632
SACREDNESS THAT WE HAVE IN THE

02:01:46.699 --> 02:01:47.233
KILLING POWER THAT WE HAVE.

02:01:47.299 --> 02:01:47.800
AND I AND I THINK IT WOULD

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:48.367
REALLY WHERE WHERE THE FOCUS

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:50.469
NEEDS TO BE IS AT THE COMMUNITY

02:01:50.536 --> 02:01:52.438
LEVEL AND WE FOUND IN SCHOOLS

02:01:52.505 --> 02:01:53.439
THE YOUNGSTERS CAN HEAL

02:01:53.506 --> 02:01:54.774
YOUNGSTERS -- YES THAT THAT THEY

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:55.741
KNOW HOW THEY THEY'RE THE

02:01:55.808 --> 02:01:56.842
CLOSEST TO EACH OTHER THEY THEY

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:58.144
CAN DETECT WHEN ONE OF THE

02:01:58.210 --> 02:02:00.680
PARTNERS IS OFF SCALAR.

02:02:00.746 --> 02:02:01.547
TALKING ABOUT SUSE I MEAN THAT

02:02:01.614 --> 02:02:04.183

GRANDMOTHERS IN MY THAT MEAN

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:09.055
THERE'S YOU KNOW BECAUSE IN

02:02:09.121 --> 02:02:10.289

02:02:13.159 --> 02:02:14.627
OF A LADY DOUBTS SO I THINK THIS

02:02:14.694 --> 02:02:17.129
STILL THAT WE NEED TO RE FRAME

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:18.597

THEY DON'T SEE THE HUMANITY IN

02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:20.145
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

02:05:20.212 --> 02:05:21.313
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:23.515
REGARDLESS.

02:05:23.582 --> 02:05:24.717
OF THE OBSTACLES WE FACE THE WE

02:05:24.783 --> 02:05:26.151
HAVE TO RECOGNIZE.

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:28.954
THAT IT'S IT'S GENERATED NO WILL

BECAUSE IT'S SO INGRAINED IN OUR

02:05:36.028 --> 02:05:37.897
SYSTEM IN OUR HUMANITY OF WHO WE

THE BEFORE YOU KILL ANYONE ELSE

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:45.571
OF THE HERE SELF AND I THINK

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:46.605
THAT.

02:05:46.672 --> 02:05:48.707
THIS IS LIKE A DISEASE INFECTED

OUR NATION ARE VERY MUCH SO

02:05:50.509 --> 02:05:52.011
INTENTIONALLY -- BECAUSE THAT'S

02:05:52.077 --> 02:05:53.445
WHAT GENOCIDE IS.

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:55.080
GENOCIDE IS NOT JUST PHYSICALLY

02:05:55.147 --> 02:05:57.349
STRIPPING ONE OF THEIR LIVES OF

02:05:57.416 --> 02:05:58.817
THEIR LIFE OR STRIPPING THEIR

CHILDREN AWAY -- IS STRIPPING

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.521
THE IDENTITY AWAY THE CONNECTION

02:06:02.588 --> 02:06:04.356
WITH OUR HISTORY WITH A CULTURE

CAN EITHER DO IT PHYSICALLY OR

02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:07.793
YOU COULD DO IT MENTALLY AND

02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:08.861
EMOTIONALLY.

02:06:08.928 --> 02:06:10.329
AND THAT GENOCIDE HAS HAS

02:06:10.396 --> 02:06:11.563

02:13:37.809 --> 02:13:43.448
AND ABOUT ALL THE YEARS THAT WE

02:13:43.515 --> 02:13:45.016
HAVE BEEN FUNDING THE BUILDING

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:46.551
OF INSTITUTIONS.

02:13:46.618 --> 02:13:48.487
IN CALIFORNIA THE LARGEST

02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:49.688
BUILDING OF PRISONS IN THE

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:51.556
HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

02:13:51.623 --> 02:13:53.592
OUR COMMITMENT TO BOYS AND MEN

02:13:53.658 --> 02:13:55.093
OF COLOR SHOULD MERE OUR

02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.829
COMMITMENT TO THE BUILDING OF

02:13:57.896 --> 02:13:59.865
THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM.

02:13:59.931 --> 02:14:01.533
IF WE DID IT FOR THIRTY YEARS WE

02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:03.368
SHOULD BE FOR TALKING ABOUT.

02:14:03.435 --> 02:14:04.469
THIRTY IF WE SPEND BILLIONS OF

02:14:04.536 --> 02:14:06.471
DOLLARS TO CREATE THAT HARM

02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:08.940
REPARATION CITIES COMMUNITIES

02:14:09.007 --> 02:14:10.876
SUGGEST WE SHOULD SPEND BILLIONS

02:14:10.942 --> 02:14:13.779
OF DOLLARS FIXING THE HARM THAT

02:14:13.845 --> 02:14:15.147
WE'VE CREATED IN CALIFORNIA.

02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:17.616
AS WELL AND SO I THINK THE NEXT

02:14:17.682 --> 02:14:18.483
TEN YEARS I'D LIKE TO SEE.

02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:20.786

A COMMITMENT TO A LONG TERM

02:14:22.687 --> 02:14:24.823
RELATIONSHIP TO GET THIS JOB

02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:27.726
WORK FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF

02:14:27.793 --> 02:14:30.629
FOLKS WHO SIT IN YOUR SEAT --

02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:32.063
SIT MIND OR NOT HAVING THIS

02:14:32.130 --> 02:14:33.432
CONVERSATION GOING FULL.

02:14:33.498 --> 02:14:35.367
SECOND WHILE THERE'S A LOT TO BE

02:14:35.434 --> 02:14:36.468
PROUD OF IN OUR COLLEAGUE MARC

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:38.003
PHILPOTT TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE

02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:39.438
HUNDRED PLUS BILLS THAT WE HAVE

02:14:39.504 --> 02:14:42.107
A FOCUSED ON WE SEE A SHIFT IN

02:14:42.174 --> 02:14:43.408
THE WAY THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE

02:14:43.475 --> 02:14:43.909
LEAVING THE SEPARATE.

02:14:43.975 --> 02:14:47.712
ALL THINKING AND ACTING AND THEY

02:14:47.779 --> 02:14:48.246
NEED PERMANENT LEGISLATIVE

02:14:48.313 --> 02:14:50.048
ACTION.

02:14:50.115 --> 02:14:52.317
HELLO WE KNOW THAT THIS GOOD THE

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:53.385
LEGISLATION THAT PRECLUDES

02:14:53.452 --> 02:14:54.486
EXPLOSIONS TO SCHOOLS ABOUT TO

02:14:54.553 --> 02:14:56.955
EXPIRE. NINE THAT'S NOT A

02:14:57.022 --> 02:14:59.024
PROBLEM TO FIX.

02:14:59.090 --> 02:14:59.891
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WHAT WE'VE

02:14:59.958 --> 02:15:01.293
LEARNED THROUGH THAT WASN'T THE

02:15:01.359 --> 02:15:03.595
KIND OF KIND OF INFORMATION THAT

02:15:03.662 --> 02:15:05.063
SUCCESS THAT SUGGEST THAT TO BE

02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:07.466
A PILOT PROJECT.

02:15:07.532 --> 02:15:09.634
RIGHT THAT'S NOT A PILOT.

02:15:09.701 --> 02:15:11.002
THAT WAS PERMANENT HARM THAT WAS

02:15:11.069 --> 02:15:11.670
DONE IT NEEDS PERMANENT

02:15:11.736 --> 02:15:14.339
SOLUTIONS AND SO WE NEED POLICY

02:15:14.406 --> 02:15:14.539
NOT.

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:16.341
NOT NOT SET TO SUNSET AT SOME

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:17.342
POINT.

02:15:17.409 --> 02:15:19.077
BUT ACTUALLY MAKES A PERMANENT

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:21.680
CASE FOR WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

02:15:21.746 --> 02:15:23.014
FOR OUR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR.

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:25.450
GOING FORWARD FUNDING FOR THAT

02:15:25.517 --> 02:15:27.519
IS IMPORTANT.

02:15:27.586 --> 02:15:28.753
I'M GONNA QUICKLY SAY THAT I'D

02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:29.654
BE REMISS AS SOME OF THE THE

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:30.222
MAJORITY ABOUT WORK IN THE

02:15:30.288 --> 02:15:32.724
CENTRAL VALLEY A CALIFORNIA TO

02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:33.658
ACTUALLY KNOW THE DIFFERENCES

02:15:33.725 --> 02:15:34.392
BETWEEN.

02:15:34.459 --> 02:15:36.294
AVAILABLE FUNDING BETWEEN OUR

02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:38.230
LARGER COMMUNITIES ON AND

02:15:38.296 --> 02:15:39.498
WEALTHY COMMUNITIES ON THE COAST

02:15:39.564 --> 02:15:42.000
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CENTRAL

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:44.169
CALIFORNIA AS WELL -- I TESTED

02:15:44.236 --> 02:15:45.737
IN THE YEARS GOING FORWARD BUT

02:15:45.804 --> 02:15:48.473
YOU DO ALL YOU CAN TO HIM TO

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:49.074
MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE SOME

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:50.141
EQUITY.

02:15:50.208 --> 02:15:51.176
I IN EQUITY IS NOT THE SAME

02:15:51.243 --> 02:15:52.377
AMOUNT SOME FAIRNESS AND HOW WE

02:15:52.444 --> 02:15:53.645
THINK ABOUT RESOURCE IN THOSE

02:15:53.712 --> 02:15:54.946
COMMUNITIES WHO ARE FACING A

02:15:55.013 --> 02:15:56.982
DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL

02:15:57.048 --> 02:15:59.718
ENVIRONMENT MANIPULATE SOME

02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:01.520
MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN.

02:16:01.586 --> 02:16:03.488
YES THIS IS BLUE CALIFORNIA WITH

02:16:03.555 --> 02:16:04.122
A LOT OF WRITTEN THE STATE THAT

02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.789
WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT WE

02:16:04.856 --> 02:16:06.358
THINK ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT WE

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:07.359
WANT TO MAKE.

02:16:07.425 --> 02:16:09.427
THIRD THE STATE HAS IMPORTANT

02:16:09.494 --> 02:16:11.162
ROLE TO PLAY IN BE PURPOSING

02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:13.532
EXISTING FUNDS FROM HARMFUL

02:16:13.598 --> 02:16:14.666
PITIFUL SYSTEMS TOLD OF ELEMENT

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:16.234
OF A MORE EXPANSIVE CONSUMER OF

02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:17.302
CARE FOR SYSTEM.

02:16:17.369 --> 02:16:19.638
IMPACTED A YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:16:19.704 --> 02:16:21.306
THAT'S JUST MY WAY OF SAYING

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:22.374
THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO

02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:24.409
DO NOT JUSTICE FUNDING TO CREATE

02:16:24.476 --> 02:16:25.911
THE KIND OF INCENTIVES THAT

02:16:25.977 --> 02:16:29.381
FORCE COUNTY TO DO THE THINGS

02:16:29.447 --> 02:16:30.916
THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY.

02:16:30.982 --> 02:16:32.117
AND I ACTUALLY DON'T BELIEVE I'M

02:16:32.183 --> 02:16:33.184
A FORMER COUNTY WELFARE DIRECT

02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:34.185
THEM A FORMER CHILD WELFARE

02:16:34.252 --> 02:16:35.720
DIRECTOR IN ALAMEDA COUNTY PROUD

02:16:35.787 --> 02:16:37.188
PUBLIC SERVANT BUT I BELIEVE

02:16:37.255 --> 02:16:39.124
THOSE SYSTEMS WILL NOT DO ALL

02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.724
THEY CAN.

02:16:39.791 --> 02:16:41.293
UNLESS YOU CREATE THE KIND OF

02:16:41.359 --> 02:16:43.962
INCENTIVES -- AND MANDATE

02:16:44.029 --> 02:16:45.096
REQUIRE THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO SO

02:16:45.163 --> 02:16:47.065
AND IT'S WITHIN YOUR POWER TO

02:16:47.132 --> 02:16:48.366
ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND WE

02:16:48.433 --> 02:16:49.701
WOULD CALL ABOUT HIS BODY TO

02:16:49.768 --> 02:16:52.804
MAKE SURE THAT IS INDEED AND IN

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:53.004
FACT.

02:16:53.071 --> 02:16:54.406
WHAT TAKES PLACE?

02:16:54.472 --> 02:16:55.273
WE HAVE THE RESEARCH WE HAVE THE

02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:56.942
KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE THE COMMUNITY

02:16:57.008 --> 02:16:58.577
PARTNERS PARTNERS GREET EXPAND

02:16:58.643 --> 02:16:59.911
THESE ALTERNATIVES AND PROMOTE

02:16:59.978 --> 02:17:01.513
NEW THINKING ABOUT WHAT A

02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:03.148
BELOVED COMMUNITY FOR ALL YOUTH.

02:17:03.214 --> 02:17:05.250
LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT IS FULLY

02:17:05.317 --> 02:17:07.619
ACTIVATED -- AND IS LEVERAGING

02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:09.120
THE POWER IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF

02:17:09.187 --> 02:17:11.489
COMMUNITY GROUPS THEMSELVES

02:17:11.556 --> 02:17:13.792
FOURTH WE TO PRIORITIZE MOVING

02:17:13.858 --> 02:17:17.028
UPSTREAM.

02:17:17.095 --> 02:17:17.662
WE GOT TO WORK WITH YOUNGER AND

02:17:17.729 --> 02:17:18.964
YOUNGER KID.

02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:20.131
NO IT'S OKAY AND IT'S GREAT TO

02:17:20.198 --> 02:17:21.299
SAY THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:21.933
KIDS WHO ENGAGE IN THE JUVENILE

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.468
JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT MANY OF THOSE

02:17:23.535 --> 02:17:24.102
KIDS WERE ONCE.

02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:25.770
IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM.

02:17:25.837 --> 02:17:27.105
WE KNOW HOW THAT HISTORY AND HOW

02:17:27.172 --> 02:17:29.207
MANY YOUNG PEOPLE A TRACK YOU

02:17:29.274 --> 02:17:31.009
HEAR A LOT OF TALK TODAY ABOUT

02:17:31.076 --> 02:17:32.577
ACES AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE

02:17:32.644 --> 02:17:33.678
WELL YEAH LET'S TALK ABOUT A

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:35.380
FIFTH AND FOURTH GRADERS.

02:17:35.447 --> 02:17:36.615
AND LET'S NOT DO IT IN A WAY AND

02:17:36.681 --> 02:17:37.816
I THINK.

02:17:37.882 --> 02:17:39.284
THE COMPOUND IS NETWORK OF

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:40.785
COLLEAGUES THE SAID IT WELL

02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:42.988
LET'S LET'S NOT PATHOLOGY

02:17:43.054 --> 02:17:44.255
BECAUSE THEM IN THIS NOT MAKE

02:17:44.322 --> 02:17:45.256
THEM NO PROBLEM.

02:17:45.323 --> 02:17:46.124
LET'S JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:47.359
HAVE THE KIND OF SUPPORTS AND

02:17:47.425 --> 02:17:49.494
SERVICES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:50.762
TO BE ON A HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:52.430
THE TRACK AND I THINK THAT OUR

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:53.832
LIFE COURSE FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY

02:17:53.898 --> 02:17:56.968
POINTS OUT.

02:17:57.035 --> 02:18:00.005
EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS.

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:02.674
I SAID A MUCH I WAS UGH UGH --

02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:03.475
COUNTY WILL FOR DIRECTOR -- AND

02:18:03.541 --> 02:18:04.376
I ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS

02:18:04.442 --> 02:18:05.577
ALWAYS BEEN YOU CAN'T SERVICE

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:08.113
PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY.

02:18:08.179 --> 02:18:10.115
YOU GOT TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY.

02:18:10.181 --> 02:18:12.417
OPPORTUNITY IS THE HELIUM AND IN

02:18:12.484 --> 02:18:13.885
EVERYONE'S LIFE BELOW.

02:18:13.952 --> 02:18:14.753
RIGHT AND THAT'S ABOUT EDUCATION

THAT'S ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:15.820
WORK THAT'S ABOUT THE

02:18:15.887 --> 02:18:17.522

FOLKS ACTUALLY NEED I REALLY

02:18:18.957 --> 02:18:20.525
WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT WE NEED

02:18:21.726 --> 02:18:23.094
ON MAKING SURE THAT THOSE

02:18:23.161 --> 02:18:26.197

BIGGEST DEALER OF KIDS IN THE

02:21:08.159 --> 02:21:09.894
WORLD. TO BEING THE BIGGEST

02:21:09.961 --> 02:21:10.562
YOUTH DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM IN THE

02:21:10.628 --> 02:21:12.931
WORLD -- AND WANT TO SHARE THE

02:21:12.997 --> 02:21:15.133
STORY OF LOS ANGELES WHERE WE'VE

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:16.734
CREATED A NUMBER OF MODEL

02:21:16.801 --> 02:21:18.436
PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT -- WE

02:21:18.503 --> 02:21:20.138
HOPE OTHERS CAN.

02:21:20.205 --> 02:21:22.874
LEARN FROM AND EXPAND -- SO YOU

02:21:22.941 --> 02:21:24.309
MAY NOT KNOW THAT A LOS ANGELES

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:26.878
PLANS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO INVEST

02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:27.478
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:21:27.545 --> 02:21:29.747
IN EACH OF THOUSANDS OF OUR MOST

02:21:29.814 --> 02:21:34.686
VULNERABLE CHILDREN.

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:36.921
IMAGINE THE THE NURTURING AND

02:21:36.988 --> 02:21:37.722
THE GROWTH THAT COULD HAPPEN BY

02:21:37.789 --> 02:21:39.791
INVESTING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:21:39.858 --> 02:21:40.391
DOLLARS IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE

02:21:40.458 --> 02:21:40.592
KIDS.

02:21:40.658 --> 02:21:41.459
BUT IN LA INSTEAD OF INVESTING

02:21:41.526 --> 02:21:42.393
IN NURTURING OUR KIDS ARE

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:43.027
ACTUALLY GONNA INVEST SIDE AND

02:21:43.094 --> 02:21:43.928
INCARCERATING THEM THAT'S HOW

02:21:43.995 --> 02:21:45.396
MUCH WE'RE GONNA PAY PER YEAR TO

02:21:45.463 --> 02:21:46.731
INCARCERATE A KID.

02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:48.833
SO IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE ABOUT

02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:49.467
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY KIDS IN JAIL

02:21:49.534 --> 02:21:51.102
YOU TONIGHT THAT'S A FEW

02:21:51.169 --> 02:21:53.338
THOUSAND A YEAR WE ARREST OVER

02:21:53.404 --> 02:21:55.006
TEN THOUSAND KIDS SO WERE ON THE

02:21:55.073 --> 02:21:57.075
WE ARE THE BIGGEST L. LA ITSELF

02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:59.077
IS THE BIGGEST DEALER IN VEGAS --

02:21:59.143 --> 02:21:59.744
ARRESTING MARKETS IN ANYWHERE IN

02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:00.612
THE WORLD.

02:22:00.678 --> 02:22:02.280
AND 95% OF THE KIDS WHO ARE IN

02:22:02.347 --> 02:22:04.716
JAIL IN LOS ANGELES ARE BLACK

02:22:04.782 --> 02:22:05.850
AND BROWN BOYS.

02:22:05.917 --> 02:22:07.151
AND AS THE NUMBER OF KIDS IN

02:22:07.218 --> 02:22:08.786
JAIL LOS ANGELES HAS GONE DOWN

02:22:08.853 --> 02:22:09.654
OVER THE YEARS.

02:22:09.721 --> 02:22:12.590
OF THE PROPORTION OF THOSE KIDS

02:22:12.657 --> 02:22:14.025
WERE BLACK AND BROWN HAS GONE UP.

02:22:14.092 --> 02:22:15.126
SO RACIAL EQUITY BECOMES REALLY

02:22:15.193 --> 02:22:17.028
IMPORTANT AS WE START TO

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:18.763
TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM.

02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:19.564
AND MOST OF THE KIDS WERE

02:22:19.631 --> 02:22:21.266
ARRESTED INCARCERATED -- IN LOS

02:22:21.332 --> 02:22:23.167
ANGELES IN FACT 80% OF THEM ARE

02:22:23.234 --> 02:22:24.535
ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION SO THE

02:22:24.602 --> 02:22:26.971
STATE HAS HAS DECIDED THAT MINOR

02:22:27.038 --> 02:22:28.940
OFFENSES LIKE PETTY THEFT --

02:22:29.007 --> 02:22:31.209
SCHOOLYARD FIGHTS TRUANCY THINGS

02:22:31.276 --> 02:22:32.176
LIKE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A

02:22:32.243 --> 02:22:33.611
DIVERSION AND THE LOS ANGELES

02:22:33.678 --> 02:22:34.946
80% OF THE KIDS WE ARE RESTING

02:22:35.013 --> 02:22:36.981
DON'T NEED TO BE ARRESTED

02:22:37.048 --> 02:22:40.118
ACCORDING TO STATE LAW -- HAVE

02:22:40.184 --> 02:22:45.990
YOU VISITED DO YOU TH STEALTH.

NOT SANTA CLARA COUNTY.

02:22:52.730 --> 02:22:55.366
SO YOU KNOW -- IN MY EXPERIENCE

02:22:55.433 --> 02:22:56.167
IN VISITING YOUTH JAILS IS THAT.

02:22:56.234 --> 02:22:57.835
JUST FINDING SUCH EXTRAORDINARY

02:22:57.902 --> 02:22:58.703
KIDS BRILLIANCE.

02:22:58.770 --> 02:23:00.238
OF POETS AND HILARIOUS STORY

02:23:00.305 --> 02:23:01.906
TELLERS AND HARD WORKING KIDS

02:23:01.973 --> 02:23:02.674
YOU JUST WANNA PROVIDE FOR THEIR

02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:03.541
FAMILIES.

02:23:03.608 --> 02:23:05.743
KIDS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED AND BY

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.445
EVERY SYSTEM THAT SET UP TO

02:23:07.512 --> 02:23:09.347
SUPPORT THEM.

02:23:09.414 --> 02:23:12.450
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THESE

02:23:12.517 --> 02:23:15.253
KIDS IN THAT NO KIDS BELONG

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:17.188
BEHIND BARS.

02:23:17.255 --> 02:23:18.222
SO THAT'S WHY WE LAUNCHED

02:23:18.289 --> 02:23:19.023
INITIATIVE AT LIBERTY HELL TO

02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:19.991

AND WE'RE GONNA USE A STRATEGY

02:23:23.261 --> 02:23:24.796
WE CALL SHRINK CLOSE IN INVEST

02:23:24.862 --> 02:23:26.464

OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ARRESTED --

02:23:27.932 --> 02:23:30.101
BY 50% IN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE

02:23:30.168 --> 02:23:31.336
YEARS WE WANNA CLOSE THE NUMBER

02:23:31.402 --> 02:23:34.105

BRING IT TOGETHER OP

02:23:51.856 --> 02:23:53.625
PHILANTHROPY ELECTED OFFICIALS

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:54.726
GOVERNMENT LEADERS THAT WITH

02:23:54.792 --> 02:23:55.994
UNDER THEIR VISION OF THE YOUNG

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:57.061

THEM I CAN TELL YOU YOU KNOW

02:24:08.773 --> 02:24:09.340
FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE MY

02:24:09.407 --> 02:24:10.241
LITTLE BROTHER WENT TO JAIL HE

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:11.442
WAS A KID AND HAS BEEN IN AND

02:24:11.509 --> 02:24:12.276
OUT OF JAIL AND HOMELESSNESS

02:24:12.343 --> 02:24:13.244
EVER SINCE.

02:24:13.311 --> 02:24:15.780
AND HE DESCRIBES THIS

02:24:15.847 --> 02:24:17.615
ENVIRONMENT OF A YOUTH JAIL LIKE

02:24:17.682 --> 02:24:19.851
IT'S LIKE AN MMA ARENA WERE

02:24:19.917 --> 02:24:21.652
LITERALLY THE KIDS ARE THERE TO

02:24:21.719 --> 02:24:24.455
TRAIN ON HOW TO FIGHT AND WIN.

02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:26.724
AND THE SKILLS THAT THEY LEARN

02:24:26.791 --> 02:24:28.659
QUITE ADEPTLY IN JUVENILE HALL

02:24:28.726 --> 02:24:30.328
AND YOUTH JAILS THIS THE SKILLS

02:24:30.395 --> 02:24:32.163
THAT THEY LEARN TO SURVIVE ARE

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:33.498
THE SAME EXACT.

02:24:33.564 --> 02:24:34.899
SKILLS THAT WHEN THEY COME ON

02:24:34.966 --> 02:24:36.801
THE OUTSIDE CAN DESTROY THEIR

02:24:36.868 --> 02:24:37.902
LIVES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:39.404
AND I DON'T I JUST CANNOT FOR

02:24:39.470 --> 02:24:40.505
THE LIFE OF ME FATHOM WHY WOULD

02:24:40.571 --> 02:24:42.373
BE PAYING ALL THIS MONEY TO

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:45.610
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THAT

02:24:45.676 --> 02:24:47.011
FOR KIDS.

02:24:47.078 --> 02:24:47.945
YOU'VE HEARD TODAY WHAT KIND OF

02:24:48.012 --> 02:24:48.980
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF A YOUTH

02:24:49.047 --> 02:24:49.614
DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM OR IF YOU

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:51.049
DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES THAT ARE

02:24:51.115 --> 02:24:52.183
SO IMPORTANT -- SO WE'LL GO

02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:53.551
THERE ALL THOSE BUT IT'S ALL

02:24:53.618 --> 02:24:55.920
BASED ON THE RESEARCH AND THE

02:24:55.987 --> 02:24:57.121
BRAIN SCIENCE THAT TELLS US THAT

02:24:57.188 --> 02:24:58.189
WHAT WE KNOW WHICH IS KIDS ARE

02:24:58.256 --> 02:24:59.390
DIFFERENT THAN ADULTS AND THEIR

02:24:59.457 --> 02:25:01.259
THE WAY THEY THINK ABOUT

02:25:01.325 --> 02:25:03.294
CONSEQUENCES THE AND ESPECIALLY

02:25:03.361 --> 02:25:04.295
LONG TERM.

02:25:04.362 --> 02:25:05.830
CONSEQUENCES THE RISK TAKING

02:25:05.897 --> 02:25:07.698
BEHAVIORS -- THE KINDS OF

02:25:07.765 --> 02:25:09.467
PRACTICES THAT CAN HOLD THEM

02:25:09.534 --> 02:25:10.735
ACCOUNTABLE VERSES MAKE THEM

02:25:10.802 --> 02:25:12.470
FEEL SO ASHAMED THAT THEY

02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:13.905
CONTINUE TO BE SELF DESTRUCTIVE.

02:25:13.971 --> 02:25:15.573
THAT'S ALL IT REALLY CRITICAL IN

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:17.175
DESIGNING PROGRAMS FOR KIDS AND

02:25:17.241 --> 02:25:18.209
WE KNOW THAT.

02:25:18.276 --> 02:25:20.044
THAT YOUTH JAILS DO NOT HAVE ANY

02:25:20.111 --> 02:25:21.679
OF THAT AND FOR THE MOST PART

02:25:21.746 --> 02:25:23.381
AND THAT THERE REALLY LEAVING

02:25:23.448 --> 02:25:24.148
OUR KIDS WORSE OFF THAN THEY

02:25:24.215 --> 02:25:24.949
FIND THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:25:25.016 --> 02:25:26.017
HAVE THESE PRACTICES WE ALSO

02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:28.753
KNOW THAT THE REALITY IS MOST OF

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:30.455
THESE KIDS -- ID ARE ELIGIBLE

02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:31.089

AND THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN

02:25:33.491 --> 02:25:34.992

02:25:47.772 --> 02:25:49.407
SO FOR FIVE THOUSAND BUCKS YOU

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:50.174

FIND THEMSELVES IN OF UNSAFE

02:26:01.619 --> 02:26:04.956

RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BASED

02:26:07.692 --> 02:26:08.826
PROGRAM WHERE KIDS ACTUALLY COME

02:26:08.893 --> 02:26:10.128
FACE TO FACE AND WHEN POSSIBLE

02:26:10.194 --> 02:26:12.530
WITH -- THE VICTIM IF THERE IS A

02:26:12.597 --> 02:26:14.031
VICTIM IN MOST CASES THERE IS

02:26:14.098 --> 02:26:15.967
NOT BUT IF THERE IS THEY'RE ABLE

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:18.236

02:26:18.302 --> 02:26:19.337
AND MAKE AMENDS AND THAT'S

02:26:19.403 --> 02:26:20.538
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPING

02:26:20.605 --> 02:26:22.773
BRAINS -- TO INSTEAD OF JUST

02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:23.808
FEELING ASHAMED AND LIKE THEY'RE

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:25.042
BAD PEOPLE AND THEY CAN NEVER DO

02:26:25.109 --> 02:26:26.377
BETTER AND THAT BECOMES A SELF

02:26:26.444 --> 02:26:27.845
FULFILLING PROPHECY -- A REAL

02:26:27.912 --> 02:26:29.213
ACCOUNTABILITY ENABLES THEM TO

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.781
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY HARM

02:26:30.848 --> 02:26:33.417
THEY'VE DONE AND MAKE IT BETTER --

02:26:33.484 --> 02:26:35.653

RECIDIVISM RATES ABOUT 11%

02:26:39.891 --> 02:26:40.691
WHEREAS IF THEY GO GET ARRESTED

02:26:40.758 --> 02:26:42.627
AND GO TO JAIL IT'S MORE LIKE

02:26:42.693 --> 02:26:46.497
33% -- SO OVER THE LAST TWO

02:26:46.564 --> 02:26:47.465

02:28:33.504 --> 02:28:34.438
AMAZING PART OF THIS WORK IS

02:28:34.505 --> 02:28:36.207
JUST THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE

IT MIGHT SOUND -- AUDACIOUS BUT

02:28:54.458 --> 02:28:55.326
THE REALITY IS THAT WERE REALLY

02:28:55.393 --> 02:28:56.927
ON THE PRECIPICE OF ENDINGS

02:28:56.994 --> 02:28:57.928

MY REMARKS I WOULD SAY IS THAT.

02:29:04.068 --> 02:29:06.037
THE ONLY REASON THAT WE ARE

02:29:06.103 --> 02:29:07.938
RESTING THOUSANDS OF KIDS IN LOS

02:29:08.005 --> 02:29:10.141

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:27.184
AND I BELIEVE IT'S TIME.

02:30:27.251 --> 02:30:28.519
NOT AT EVERY JAIL COULD BE

02:30:28.586 --> 02:30:29.887
TURNED INTO A COLLEGE

02:30:29.954 --> 02:30:30.187
[inaudible]

02:30:30.254 --> 02:30:34.558
BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE IN

02:30:34.625 --> 02:30:36.360
SOME PLACES THAT ARE RATE REALLY

02:30:36.427 --> 02:30:37.895
BEAUTIFUL.

02:30:37.962 --> 02:30:39.163
AND THAT'S TAXPAYERS PAY FOR

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:42.133
THOSE PLACES AND DOM AND I THINK --

02:30:42.199 --> 02:30:43.701
TAKING THOSE BACK IF THEY ARE

02:30:43.768 --> 02:30:45.603

THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE AND

02:30:48.572 --> 02:30:50.341
TRANSFORMING THEM INTO VOLUNTARY

02:30:50.408 --> 02:30:51.208
SCHOOLS.

02:30:51.275 --> 02:30:53.911
IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO WE

02:30:53.978 --> 02:30:55.246
CAN'T REOPEN THEM AGAIN EVER.

02:30:55.312 --> 02:30:57.882
AND SO LAST YEAR IN COUNTIES

02:30:57.948 --> 02:30:59.817
ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT HOUSE

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:02.186
JUVENILE OF THAT HOUSE A

02:31:02.253 --> 02:31:03.320
JUVENILE FACILITIES.

MORE THAN 90% OF THE JAIL'S WERE

02:31:05.956 --> 02:31:07.458
LESS THAN HALF FULL.

02:31:07.525 --> 02:31:10.094
IN FACT ONE WAS ONLY AT 16%

02:31:10.161 --> 02:31:12.296
CAPACITY.

02:31:12.363 --> 02:31:13.764
THE ANNUAL COST OF INCARCERATING

02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:15.399
A YOUNG PERSON IN JUVENILE HALL

02:31:15.466 --> 02:31:16.867
IN CALIFORNIA HAS DOUBLED OVER

02:31:16.934 --> 02:31:18.569
THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.

02:31:18.636 --> 02:31:20.104
WITH BUDGET WITH JUVENILE HALLS

02:31:20.171 --> 02:31:22.940
AND KANSEN RANCHES DRASTICALLY

02:31:23.007 --> 02:31:24.341
UNDER UTILIZED THE COST TO

02:31:24.408 --> 02:31:26.076
INCARCERATE A YOUNG PERSON IS

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:27.912
STILL RISING AND CONTINUES TO

02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:28.446
RISE.

02:31:28.512 --> 02:31:29.914
IN SOME COUNTY -- SPENDING MORE

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:31.749
THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:31:31.816 --> 02:31:33.517
DOLLARS PER YOUNG PERSON TO BE A

02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:35.920
CAR INCARCERATED AND A LOT OF

02:31:35.986 --> 02:31:37.121
TIME THAT FOR STATUS OFFENSES

02:31:37.188 --> 02:31:40.424
STATUS OFFENSES ARE -- VIOLATION

PERIOD BUILT IN.

02:36:28.579 --> 02:36:30.247
AND THEN OUR GOAL IS TO ONCE

02:36:30.314 --> 02:36:31.682

WITH THIS MODEL WE STABILIZE AND

02:37:39.416 --> 02:37:41.251
REBUILD OUR COMMUNITIES ADDING

02:37:41.318 --> 02:37:42.886

A MORE ECONOMIC STABILITY ACROSS

02:37:48.358 --> 02:37:49.560
THE STATE UTILIZING EMPTY

FRACTION OF THE COST.

02:37:58.969 --> 02:38:01.672
OF BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOUNG

02:42:25.268 --> 02:42:26.503
IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE OF THE

02:42:26.570 --> 02:42:28.538
FIRST LAW THAT PASSED WAS AN ACT

02:42:28.605 --> 02:42:29.539
FOR THE GOVERNMENT PROTECTION OF

THE WAR AND IMMIGRANTS HERE.

02:42:46.756 --> 02:42:48.725

FOREIGNERS INTO THE GOLD RUSH

02:42:50.994 --> 02:42:54.631
INTO THE MINING INDUSTRY SO.

AMERICAN RULE WHERE YOU'VE BEEN --

02:43:01.371 --> 02:43:04.441

THE GOLD RUSH AND ALL THE RICHES

02:43:15.652 --> 02:43:16.153
THAT WILL COME FROM IT THEN

02:43:16.219 --> 02:43:19.256
THERE WAS THE GREASER ACT OF

02:43:19.322 --> 02:43:19.890
EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE WHICH AGREE

02:43:19.956 --> 02:43:20.624
THROUGH THE DOG FOR A TIME TO

DESCRIBE MEXICANS -- IT WAS THAT

02:43:22.592 --> 02:43:23.727
DEBATE WITH THE VACANCY ACT

A STATE SYSTEM TO CONVICT LABOR --

02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:42.579

02:48:19.322 --> 02:48:20.089
AMOUNT.

02:48:20.156 --> 02:48:21.524
OF THAT WAS DURING THE TIME WHEN

02:48:21.591 --> 02:48:22.792
THERE'S A GREAT RECESSION WHEN

BUDGET TO KEEP THIS THAT -- WHEN

02:48:42.312 --> 02:48:43.480
WE DON'T NEED THAT AND OBVIOUSLY

02:48:43.546 --> 02:48:44.080

CAREERS IN THE TECH INDUSTRY BUT

03:01:24.006 --> 03:01:25.307
THE THE WAY YOU'RE SETTING IT UP

03:01:25.374 --> 03:01:26.809
IT SEEMS KIND OF A NICE MATCH --

03:01:26.875 --> 03:01:27.576
TO HAVE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE

03:01:27.643 --> 03:01:28.777

03:01:32.881 --> 03:01:35.351
TIME IN -- IN JAILS AND IN SANTA

03:01:35.417 --> 03:01:37.920
CLARA COUNTY I THINK CERTAINLY --

03:01:37.987 --> 03:01:39.154
TRANSFORMING THEM INTO SOMETHING

03:01:39.221 --> 03:01:42.558
POSITIVE AND HEALING BECAUSE YOU

03:01:42.625 --> 03:01:43.792
TO IMPRISON A REALLY TWO THINGS

03:01:43.859 --> 03:01:44.159
I SHOULDN'T BE.

03:01:44.226 --> 03:01:47.129
TOGETHER -- AND SO -- I I THINK

03:01:47.196 --> 03:01:49.431
THAT ALL OF YOU SPOKE TO THE TO

03:01:49.498 --> 03:01:52.434
THAT OF HOW WE MEMBER AND THAT

03:01:52.501 --> 03:02:06.682
CONSTRUCT -- AND AS MS ROBBINS

03:02:06.749 --> 03:02:07.316
WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW KIND

03:02:07.383 --> 03:02:08.450
OF HOW.

03:02:08.517 --> 03:02:12.454
NUMBER BARELY ADDRESSING -- TALK

03:02:12.521 --> 03:02:14.990
ABOUT USE OF FORCE IN AFTER A

03:02:15.057 --> 03:02:16.158
HUNDRED YEARS WHICH IT WAS A LOT

03:02:16.225 --> 03:02:17.526
OF THINGS OUR BELLIES ORINDA

03:02:17.593 --> 03:02:18.727
DRESSED HOUSE A STATE -- AND I'M

03:02:18.794 --> 03:02:20.529
GLAD WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE SOME

03:02:20.596 --> 03:02:21.463
OTHER STATES ON EVEN THERE YET

03:02:21.530 --> 03:02:21.797
ARE FAR OFF.

03:02:21.864 --> 03:02:23.165
AND SO I DO I DO THINK THAT WE

03:02:23.232 --> 03:02:23.699
HAVE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY

03:02:23.766 --> 03:02:24.733
THERE'S A SPIN OFF FROM THIS

03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:25.301
SELECT COMMITTEE ARE FORMER

TO AND THE SCHOOL TO PRISON

03:02:28.337 --> 03:02:29.138
PIPELINE SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK

03:02:29.204 --> 03:02:29.772
THAT'LL WORK REALLY NICELY IN

03:02:29.838 --> 03:02:30.406
CONJUNCTION WITH THIS COMMITTEE

GONNA BE TEND TO BE MORE

03:03:14.817 --> 03:03:16.485
SUPPORTIVE MAYBE NOT ALWAYS BUT

LOOKING KNOW THEY'VE ALREADY.

03:03:27.196 --> 03:03:29.131
ARE ARE MOVING GO THERE THE IN

03:03:29.198 --> 03:03:29.798
THESE COUNTIES SHUT DOWN

03:03:29.865 --> 03:03:32.067
JUVENILE HALL AND AND AND AND

03:03:32.134 --> 03:03:33.135
HOW TO BE.

03:03:33.202 --> 03:03:34.370
A GUEST OF OPEN QUESTION IS HOW

03:03:34.436 --> 03:03:35.237
DO WE GET THESE MORE

03:03:35.304 --> 03:03:37.106
CONSERVATIVE COUNTY IS THAT

03:03:37.172 --> 03:03:38.006
MAYBE DON'T HAVE SUPPORT OF

03:03:38.073 --> 03:03:40.075
SHARES OR BOARD SUPERVISORS OR

03:03:40.142 --> 03:03:41.643
DISAGREE ATTORNEYS BUT WE KNOW

03:03:41.710 --> 03:03:43.078
THAT MANY OF YOU ARE ON THE

03:03:43.145 --> 03:03:44.246
GROUND THERE.

03:03:44.313 --> 03:03:45.781
DOING THE WORK HOW DO WE SUPPORT

03:03:45.848 --> 03:03:47.416
YOUR WORK WITHOUT THE POLITICAL

03:03:47.483 --> 03:03:48.917
SUPPORT.

03:03:48.984 --> 03:03:50.085
AT THOSE LOCAL LEVELS UNTIL WE

03:03:50.152 --> 03:03:51.186
CAN CHANGE ALL THOSE POLITICIANS

03:03:51.253 --> 03:03:53.389
ARE HOW DO HOW DO WE GET.

03:03:53.455 --> 03:03:54.623
THE RESOURCES INTO THOSE

03:03:54.690 --> 03:03:55.557
COUNTIES BECAUSE I'D NOW IS A

03:03:55.624 --> 03:03:56.625
VERY FAIR POINT.

03:03:56.692 --> 03:03:57.926
THAT A LOT OF THE MONEY IS GOING

03:03:57.993 --> 03:03:59.862
INTO THE COUNTIES THAT ALREADY

03:03:59.928 --> 03:04:01.430
HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT IT'S KIND

03:04:01.497 --> 03:04:01.997
OF LIKE A SELF FULFILLING

03:04:02.064 --> 03:04:04.800
PROPHECY WHAT COMES FIRST.

03:04:04.867 --> 03:04:06.201
AND SO I I THINK THAT'S AN OPEN

03:04:06.268 --> 03:04:07.736
QUESTION TO THINK ABOUT AS

03:04:07.803 --> 03:04:09.638
REPORTING MORE MORE MONEY -- IN

03:04:09.705 --> 03:04:11.340
INTO THESE VERY WORTHY PROGRAMS

03:04:11.407 --> 03:04:13.575
A LOT OF YOU A LOT OF THOSE THAT

03:04:13.642 --> 03:04:14.810
ARE THAT SPOKE ON THE PREVIOUS

03:04:14.877 --> 03:04:16.445
PANEL WORKING ON HOW DO WE HOW

03:04:16.512 --> 03:04:17.212
DO WE AYE IF WE DON'T WE CAN'T

03:04:17.279 --> 03:04:19.047
CHANGE THE MINDS AND HEARTS.

03:04:19.114 --> 03:04:20.649
OF THOSE ELECTED LEADERS THAT

03:04:20.716 --> 03:04:22.084
HAVE CONTROL OVER THOSE PURSE

03:04:22.151 --> 03:04:23.552
STRINGS HOW CAN HELP ME FIGURE

03:04:23.619 --> 03:04:24.686
OUT A WAY TO STILL GET THOSE

03:04:24.753 --> 03:04:26.188
PROGRAMS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED.

03:04:26.255 --> 03:04:28.190
EVEN IF THOSE POLITICIANS AT THE

03:04:28.257 --> 03:04:29.892
SMALL DAY IN TIME ARE NECESSARY

03:04:29.958 --> 03:04:32.327
SUPPORTING THEM SO THAT'S AGAIN

03:04:32.394 --> 03:04:34.196
OPEN QUESTION FOR US TO KIND OF

03:04:34.263 --> 03:04:35.497
THINK ABOUT BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY

03:04:35.564 --> 03:04:43.439
SUPPLY CAME TO MIND.

03:04:43.505 --> 03:04:46.642
WHEN CHAD AND MENTION THAT?

03:04:46.708 --> 03:04:48.410
GOOD QUESTIONS WITH ANYONE LIKE

03:04:48.477 --> 03:04:49.812
TO TAKE A SHOT AT I WAS JUST

03:04:49.878 --> 03:04:51.380
GONNA -- SAY THAT I KNOW THAT

03:04:51.447 --> 03:04:52.347
THAT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT YOU

03:04:52.414 --> 03:04:53.248
KNOW THING TO TACKLE BUT I THINK

03:04:53.315 --> 03:04:53.882
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS IS

03:04:53.949 --> 03:04:54.683
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

03:04:54.750 --> 03:04:55.851
DISTRIBUTING FUNDING OUR GRANTS

03:04:55.918 --> 03:04:56.185
OR ANYTHING.

03:04:56.251 --> 03:04:56.685
IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE

03:04:56.752 --> 03:04:58.887
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

03:04:58.954 --> 03:04:59.555
SUCCESSFUL.

03:04:59.621 --> 03:05:00.489
AND HAVE THE TRACK RECORD AND

03:05:00.556 --> 03:05:02.024
HAVE PROVEN THAT THE SYSTEMS

03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:02.524
THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY

03:05:02.591 --> 03:05:03.225
UTILIZING.

03:05:03.292 --> 03:05:05.427
THEN WILL IMPACT THE COMMUNITY

03:05:05.494 --> 03:05:07.095
AND I THINK.

03:05:07.162 --> 03:05:08.230
THAT NEEDS TO START THERE.

03:05:08.297 --> 03:05:09.164
BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE OUR SCHOOL

03:05:09.231 --> 03:05:10.999
DISTRICT WE COULD HAVE JUST

03:05:11.066 --> 03:05:11.967
FOCUSED ON THE U..

03:05:12.034 --> 03:05:13.669
AND THAT'S GOOD RIGHT WE NEED TO

03:05:13.735 --> 03:05:15.037
FOCUS ON OUR YOUTH AND GROW THEM

03:05:15.103 --> 03:05:17.639
BUT IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AS

03:05:17.706 --> 03:05:18.841
MUCH LIKE A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM.

03:05:18.907 --> 03:05:20.309
YOU KNOW THERE'S THINGS THAT YOU

03:05:20.375 --> 03:05:22.845
CAN'T CONTROL SO THIS IS WHY THE

03:05:22.911 --> 03:05:24.680
APPROACH THAT WE TOOK WITH THE

03:05:24.746 --> 03:05:25.547
WITH THE NATIONAL BY DOESN'T

03:05:25.614 --> 03:05:27.082
WORK AS TO YOU KNOW NOT NOT ONLY

03:05:27.149 --> 03:05:28.450
ARE WE HERE WITH THE STUDENTS

03:05:28.517 --> 03:05:29.151
BUT WE HEAR WITH THE

03:05:29.218 --> 03:05:31.320
ADMINISTRATION AN IN HOUSE TO

03:05:31.386 --> 03:05:31.753
MEET IN THE MIDDLE.

03:05:31.820 --> 03:05:33.355
SOMEWHERE.

03:05:33.422 --> 03:05:34.490
IN A AND AND I KNOW THAT'S

03:05:34.556 --> 03:05:36.225
DIFFICULT TO DO IN IT AND I KNOW

03:05:36.291 --> 03:05:36.792
I'M READING THIS AND YOU'RE

03:05:36.859 --> 03:05:37.125
THINKING WOW.

03:05:37.192 --> 03:05:39.194
BUT IT WASN'T THAT EASY THE

03:05:39.261 --> 03:05:40.262
FIRST YEAR NOBODY WOULD LIKE

03:05:40.329 --> 03:05:40.929
WHAT IS IS WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU

03:05:40.996 --> 03:05:42.764
WANT ME TO TOUCH AND FEEL MY

03:05:42.831 --> 03:05:44.166
HEART LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

03:05:44.233 --> 03:05:46.602
YOU KNOW BUT BUT OVER TIME YOU

03:05:46.668 --> 03:05:48.370
KNOW WHEN THEY STARTED IN A TO

03:05:48.437 --> 03:05:49.538
INTERNALIZES AND SEE THE WORK

03:05:49.605 --> 03:05:51.373
THAT IS GOING ON IN THE AND I

03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:51.940
HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH THE

03:05:52.007 --> 03:05:53.008
INSANE THAT.

03:05:53.075 --> 03:05:54.676
THE PUSH THAT IS YOU KNOW COMING

03:05:54.743 --> 03:05:57.379
FROM FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE

03:05:57.446 --> 03:05:58.780
ASSEMBLY IS HELPING.

03:05:58.847 --> 03:05:59.915
BECAUSE IN THERE YOU KNOW EVEN

03:05:59.982 --> 03:06:01.650
IF PEOPLE JUST DO IT JUST

03:06:01.717 --> 03:06:02.718
BECAUSE IT'S THE CURRENT

03:06:02.784 --> 03:06:03.852
NARRATIVE THAT'S OKAY.

03:06:03.919 --> 03:06:04.753
IT THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE THAT

03:06:04.820 --> 03:06:07.189
PATHWAY FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO

03:06:07.256 --> 03:06:08.524
YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S

03:06:08.590 --> 03:06:11.260
GOING ON IN EITHER JUMP BONNER

03:06:11.326 --> 03:06:11.693
YOU KNOW.

03:06:11.760 --> 03:06:14.062
JUMP UP AND NOT BUT BE QUIET NOT

03:06:14.129 --> 03:06:14.897
CAUSE ANY MORE PROBLEMS AND

03:06:14.963 --> 03:06:15.664
THAT'S IT YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME

03:06:15.731 --> 03:06:16.498
THAT I THINK WE CAN HOPE.

03:06:16.565 --> 03:06:17.599
FOR IS THAT THOSE WHO ARE

03:06:17.666 --> 03:06:19.067
PASSIONATE AND WHO ARE REALLY

03:06:19.134 --> 03:06:21.136
VESTED IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING ARE

03:06:21.203 --> 03:06:22.437
GOING TO AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT

03:06:22.504 --> 03:06:24.640
AND CAN JUST.

03:06:24.706 --> 03:06:25.607
YOU KNOW TAKE A STEP BACK AND

03:06:25.674 --> 03:06:28.243
THAT'S OKAY WELL LEVEL MANY WAY

03:06:28.310 --> 03:06:29.645
FROM AFAR YEAH WELL AS I GUESS

03:06:29.711 --> 03:06:30.779
IS YOUR BUILDING THE MOMENTUM

03:06:30.846 --> 03:06:36.051
FROM THE GROUND UP.

03:06:36.118 --> 03:06:37.753
THE GRASSROOTS.

03:06:37.819 --> 03:06:39.755
THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE AND JUST

03:06:39.821 --> 03:06:43.125
SQUEEZE ABOUT THE CAN EITHER

03:06:43.191 --> 03:06:44.927
GUILT.

03:06:44.993 --> 03:06:47.930
JOINT OR STEP ASIDE [inaudible]

03:06:47.996 --> 03:06:50.933
THANK -- YEAH I JUST WANTED TO

03:06:50.999 --> 03:06:52.434
ADD I THINK.

03:06:52.501 --> 03:06:54.169
I THINK YOU YOU HAD EXACTLY ON

03:06:54.236 --> 03:06:55.637
THE HEAD AND ARM I THINK A WAY

03:06:55.704 --> 03:06:57.873
FOR US TO TO TANGIBLY DO THAT

03:06:57.940 --> 03:06:59.741
THE VERY LEAST THIS THIS BODY

03:06:59.808 --> 03:07:00.509
THIS LEGISLATURE CAN DO THAT IS

03:07:00.576 --> 03:07:01.510
BY CREATING YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

03:07:01.577 --> 03:07:02.377
DEPARTMENT WE'RE ALL YOUNG

03:07:02.444 --> 03:07:03.645
PEOPLE IN OUR YOUTH SERVICES

03:07:03.712 --> 03:07:05.814
UNDER THAT DEPARTMENT -- AND

03:07:05.881 --> 03:07:06.882
IT'LL BE TOO ENTICING BILLS

03:07:06.949 --> 03:07:08.750
CONSERVE COUNTY THIS TO MISS OUT

03:07:08.817 --> 03:07:09.785
ON OUT ON THESE FUNDS OF THESE

03:07:09.851 --> 03:07:11.053
MONEY AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

03:07:11.119 --> 03:07:13.121
AND THEN SECONDLY -- I THINK

03:07:13.188 --> 03:07:14.323
BRINGING BACK SB FORTY THREE I

03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.990
BELIEVE WAS THE NUMBER BY MINING

03:07:15.057 --> 03:07:15.991
WHICH WOULD HAVE CREATED A PILOT

03:07:16.058 --> 03:07:17.993
PROGRAM -- PILOT FUNDS FOR FIVE

03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:18.961
YOUTH DEVELOPMENT APARTMENTS IN

03:07:19.027 --> 03:07:20.228
FIVE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE

03:07:20.295 --> 03:07:21.396
THAT WOULD APPLY.

03:07:21.463 --> 03:07:22.431
ARM IT WAS KILLED I THINK THAT'S

03:07:22.497 --> 03:07:23.231
A TESTAMENT TO WHAT YOU'RE

03:07:23.298 --> 03:07:24.466
TALKING ABOUT THESE CONSIDER

03:07:24.533 --> 03:07:25.867
COUNTIES THE LOT OF POWER IN

03:07:25.934 --> 03:07:27.436
PROBATION STUDS A LOT OF POWER

03:07:27.502 --> 03:07:28.470
TO SEND SEEN.

03:07:28.537 --> 03:07:31.006
THAT -- THAT THAT THE STRONGHOLD

03:07:31.073 --> 03:07:32.274
THAT THEY HAVE OVER CALIFORNIA'S.

03:07:32.341 --> 03:07:32.908
THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG

03:07:32.975 --> 03:07:34.042
PEOPLE COMING TO AN END -- BUT I

03:07:34.109 --> 03:07:35.744
THINK IF WE CAN BRING THAT BACK

03:07:35.811 --> 03:07:38.013
WE CAN SLOWLY START BUILDING.

03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:45.621
ON AND AND CREATING DEVELOPMENT

03:07:45.687 --> 03:07:47.990
ALL BECAUSE STATE.

03:07:48.056 --> 03:07:48.423
THANK YOU.

03:07:48.490 --> 03:07:48.991

RELATES TO OUR SCHOOL CLIMB IT.

03:07:51.326 --> 03:07:52.461
AND ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW WE'VE

03:07:52.527 --> 03:07:53.495
GIVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS --

03:07:53.562 --> 03:07:54.396
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISCRETION

03:07:54.463 --> 03:07:55.697
UTILIZING LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

03:07:55.764 --> 03:07:55.964
FORMULAS.

03:07:56.031 --> 03:07:59.201
WHAT COULD WE DO MORE TO ADD

03:07:59.267 --> 03:08:00.736
MAYBE THE WORD IS INCENTIVIZE

03:08:00.802 --> 03:08:02.971
SCHOOL DISTRICTS? TO UTILIZE IN

03:08:03.038 --> 03:08:04.606
PRIORITIZE SOME OF THESE

03:08:04.673 --> 03:08:07.009
RESOURCES -- TO IMPLEMENT YOU

03:08:07.075 --> 03:08:10.178
KNOW WHY THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS

03:08:10.245 --> 03:08:11.847
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT --

03:08:11.913 --> 03:08:13.181
CERTAINLY A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE

03:08:13.248 --> 03:08:15.851
SCHOOL -- BUT OUTSIDE.

03:08:15.917 --> 03:08:21.556
LOVE TO HEAR WHAT -- WHAT COULD

03:08:21.623 --> 03:08:25.394
WE DO?

03:08:25.460 --> 03:08:26.361
IN THE LA BECAUSE THE SCHOOL

03:08:26.428 --> 03:08:28.263
CLIMATE BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH WAS

03:08:28.330 --> 03:08:29.398
FOUGHT FOR BY FOLKS IN THIS ROOM

03:08:29.464 --> 03:08:30.899
AND OTHERS BE REDUCE SUSPENSIONS

03:08:30.966 --> 03:08:32.234
BY OVER 70% BY ELIMINATING

03:08:32.300 --> 03:08:33.435
WILLFUL DEFIANCE IS A REASON FOR

03:08:33.502 --> 03:08:34.970
SUSPENSION BUT THAT WAS SEVERAL

03:08:35.037 --> 03:08:36.271
YEARS AGO AN EX EXTRAORDINARY

03:08:36.338 --> 03:08:37.639
SUCCESS BUT WE FOR LEARNED

03:08:37.706 --> 03:08:38.507
RECENTLY.

03:08:38.573 --> 03:08:40.876
IS THAT -- ARRESTS OF KIDS ON

03:08:40.942 --> 03:08:42.310
THOSE CAMPUSES IS GOING UP AS OF

03:08:42.377 --> 03:08:43.745
THE ORIGINAL VISION WAS THAT

03:08:43.812 --> 03:08:44.913
RESOURCES FOR RESTORATIVE

03:08:44.980 --> 03:08:46.548
JUSTICE ANOTHER SERVICES WERE

03:08:46.615 --> 03:08:48.016
SUPPOSED TO REPLACE THE NEED FOR

03:08:48.083 --> 03:08:49.184
SUSPENSION.

03:08:49.251 --> 03:08:50.385
AND IT WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND WE'VE

03:08:50.452 --> 03:08:51.186
SEEN SOME OTHER PROGRAMS WE

03:08:51.253 --> 03:08:52.387
TALKED ABOUT TODAY THAT THAT

03:08:52.454 --> 03:08:53.622
PART DOESN'T HAPPEN SOMETIMES A

03:08:53.689 --> 03:08:54.523
REFORM HAPPENS WITHOUT THE

03:08:54.589 --> 03:08:55.824
SERVICES AND I THINK WITH YOUNG

03:08:55.891 --> 03:08:57.125
PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WE JUST REALLY

03:08:57.192 --> 03:08:58.493
CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THAT

03:08:58.560 --> 03:08:59.094
MISTAKE AND WHAT YOU'VE HEARD

03:08:59.161 --> 03:08:59.561
TODAY IS.

03:08:59.628 --> 03:09:01.430
A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF UNITY AROUND

03:09:01.496 --> 03:09:02.230
LIKE WILL NEVER MAKE THAT

03:09:02.297 --> 03:09:03.465
MISTAKE AGAIN AND LET'S MAKE

03:09:03.532 --> 03:09:04.633
SURE THE RESOURCES ARE THERE.

03:09:04.700 --> 03:09:06.168
SO I THINK YOU KNOW MAKING SURE

03:09:06.234 --> 03:09:07.235
THE RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY

03:09:07.302 --> 03:09:08.403
ALLOCATED IN SCHOOLS FOR

03:09:08.470 --> 03:09:09.771
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND FOR REAL

03:09:09.838 --> 03:09:11.640
ALTERNATIVES TO SUSPENSION WHICH

03:09:11.707 --> 03:09:12.507
INCLUDES TEACHER TRAINING BUT

03:09:12.574 --> 03:09:14.810
ALSO SPECIFIC SERVICES FOR KIDS.

03:09:14.876 --> 03:09:15.977
AND ALSO THERE'S A REAL OVER

03:09:16.044 --> 03:09:17.646
RELIANCE ON SCHOOL POLICE AND

03:09:17.713 --> 03:09:19.548
SOME OF THESE -- SCHOOLS AND SO

03:09:19.614 --> 03:09:23.552
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO

03:09:23.618 --> 03:09:24.519
ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK YOU KNOW.

03:09:24.586 --> 03:09:25.187
SCHOOLS AND KIDS ARE LOOKING FOR

03:09:25.253 --> 03:09:27.055
CARING ADULTS AND SCHOOL POLICE.

03:09:27.122 --> 03:09:28.490
IF THAT'S THE SOURCE OF CARING

03:09:28.557 --> 03:09:29.991
ADULTS ARE SOME REALLY SERIOUS

03:09:30.058 --> 03:09:31.793
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO THAT

03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:37.532

03:10:48.937 --> 03:10:50.739
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CHALLENGES

03:10:50.806 --> 03:10:52.374
WITH OUR SCHOOL CLIMATE IN THE

03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:53.508
IMPACT IT'S HAVING.

03:10:53.575 --> 03:10:55.510
ON DRAMATIZATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE

03:10:55.577 --> 03:10:58.046
SO SHOULD THERE BE SOMETHING

03:10:58.113 --> 03:11:00.115
THAT WE'RE DOING LEGISLATIVELY.

03:11:00.182 --> 03:11:02.417
TO CONDITION THE ACCEPTANCE OF

03:11:02.484 --> 03:11:03.785
THESE DOLLARS TO GOAL TOWARDS

03:11:03.852 --> 03:11:05.921
THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND AND

03:11:05.987 --> 03:11:09.758
IF SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE.

03:11:09.825 --> 03:11:12.460
I DON'T HAVE ANY.

03:11:12.527 --> 03:11:17.599
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER EITHER

03:11:17.666 --> 03:11:17.999
REALLY COULD NOT.

03:11:18.066 --> 03:11:23.672
IN THE ORGANIZING YEAH TAKE THE

03:11:23.738 --> 03:11:26.608
PRESSURE.

03:11:26.675 --> 03:11:27.943
GREAT THE PRESSURE ON MY ON THE

03:11:28.009 --> 03:11:29.578
LOCAL AREA -- BUT THE FUNDING

03:11:29.644 --> 03:11:30.912
YOUTH ORGANIZING I LIKE THAT

03:11:30.979 --> 03:11:32.180
IDEA BECAUSE I THINK ON WITH THE

03:11:32.247 --> 03:11:32.848
KIND OF CENTER BY THE SCHOOLS WE

03:11:32.914 --> 03:11:33.181
CAN WE CAN.

03:11:33.248 --> 03:11:33.715
SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

03:11:33.782 --> 03:11:36.017
ORGANIZING AT THEIR SCHOOLS TO

03:11:36.084 --> 03:11:36.551
TO GET THESE PROGRAMS DONE

03:11:36.618 --> 03:11:40.388
LOCALLY.

03:11:40.455 --> 03:11:42.090
SO I WANTED TO SPEAK -- REAL

03:11:42.157 --> 03:11:44.326
QUICK AS FAR AS A RESOURCE

03:11:44.392 --> 03:11:46.528
OFFICERS SO -- OUR OUR SCHOOL

03:11:46.595 --> 03:11:48.263
DISTRICT A TO THEM ACTUALLY

03:11:48.330 --> 03:11:49.598
DISMISSED.

03:11:49.664 --> 03:11:50.699
ALL OF THE RESOURCE OFFICERS

03:11:50.765 --> 03:11:52.667
FROM OUR CAMPUS THIS PAST SCHOOL

03:11:52.734 --> 03:11:53.134
YEAR.

03:11:53.201 --> 03:11:54.903
SO SHUT UP TO TO OUR BOARD

03:11:54.970 --> 03:11:57.105
MEMBERS AND I KNOW WE HAVE ONE

03:11:57.172 --> 03:11:58.607
HERE IN THE AUDIENCE LEFT EARLY --

03:11:58.673 --> 03:12:00.675
AND THE REASON THAT ONE NUMBER

03:12:00.742 --> 03:12:02.777
ONE AND ALL THAT I'M OUR BOARD

03:12:02.844 --> 03:12:04.379
MEMBERS ARE ARE PROGRESSIVE.

03:12:04.446 --> 03:12:06.748
AND I KNOW THAT -- MANY OF THEM

03:12:06.815 --> 03:12:09.150
DO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE WORK --

03:12:09.217 --> 03:12:11.820
THAT IS BEING DONE AND SO THEY

03:12:11.887 --> 03:12:14.456
WERE ABLE TO TO DO THAT NOT ONLY

03:12:14.522 --> 03:12:16.024
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT

03:12:16.091 --> 03:12:18.460
WAS NOT AND YOU KNOW GOOD USE OF

03:12:18.526 --> 03:12:21.930
RESOURCES FOR SURE -- BUT ALSO

03:12:21.997 --> 03:12:26.534
BECAUSE WITH THE LC FF DOLLARS.

03:12:26.601 --> 03:12:27.836
HEALTHY A FIFTY DOLLARS.

03:12:27.903 --> 03:12:30.272
BEEN A LONG DAY -- THEY ARE

03:12:30.338 --> 03:12:32.707
FUNDING AS SO THERE'S A MOVEMENT

03:12:32.774 --> 03:12:34.242
TO INTEGRATE P. B. I. S. AND HAS

03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:35.777
BEEN FUNDED FOR COUPLE YEARS

03:12:35.844 --> 03:12:37.012
NINE OR SCHOOL DISTRICT.

03:12:37.078 --> 03:12:40.048
SO ALL THE SCHOOLS -- WITHIN THE

03:12:40.115 --> 03:12:42.083
NEXT YEAR TO HAVE TO BE -- PBS

03:12:42.150 --> 03:12:44.953
COMPLIANT JUST ACCORDING. TO TO

03:12:45.020 --> 03:12:47.222
THAT -- TRAINING -- THERE IS

03:12:47.289 --> 03:12:49.291
SOME FUNDING THAT IS GOING

03:12:49.357 --> 03:12:52.661
TOWARDS -- SOME OF THE RJ

03:12:52.727 --> 03:12:53.361
PROGRAMS.

03:12:53.428 --> 03:12:53.995
AND THEN WE YOU KNOW OF COURSE

03:12:54.062 --> 03:12:55.397
WE HAVE THIS GRANT SO I THINK

03:12:55.463 --> 03:12:57.232
CONTINUING TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES

03:12:57.299 --> 03:12:58.733
SUCH AS THESE.

03:12:58.800 --> 03:13:00.869
BECAUSE I'M YOU KNOW WORKING AND

03:13:00.936 --> 03:13:02.671
I'VE BEEN IN THE WORK IN FRISCO

03:13:02.737 --> 03:13:04.306
THIS YEAR FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS.

03:13:04.372 --> 03:13:05.607
SO YOU KNOW LIKE I MENTIONED

03:13:05.674 --> 03:13:07.475
BEFORE -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE

03:13:07.542 --> 03:13:09.344
THEY'RE SYSTEMIC LIKE A LOT OF

03:13:09.411 --> 03:13:10.845
OTHER SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE.

03:13:10.912 --> 03:13:12.948
AND I THINK HAD THIS GRANT NOT

03:13:13.014 --> 03:13:15.250
COMMAND AND THEY WERE EXPOSED TO

03:13:15.317 --> 03:13:18.386
THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE --

03:13:18.453 --> 03:13:18.987
WITH THE WITH THE COMBAT IS

03:13:19.054 --> 03:13:20.021
NETWORK.

03:13:20.088 --> 03:13:21.957
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO KEY IN ON

03:13:22.023 --> 03:13:24.159
A CLUE NO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IS

03:13:24.225 --> 03:13:24.726
HOW IS THIS CUTE OR SCHOOL

03:13:24.793 --> 03:13:25.961
DISTRICT.

03:13:26.027 --> 03:13:28.196
AND I AND I SEE THAT -- ONE OF

03:13:28.263 --> 03:13:29.798
THE BIGGEST THINGS AND THAT'S

03:13:29.864 --> 03:13:32.434
REALLY DIFFICULT AND IS IT WAS A

03:13:32.500 --> 03:13:33.034
CHALLENGE FOR US IN OUR SCHOOL

03:13:33.101 --> 03:13:33.902
DISTRICT.

03:13:33.969 --> 03:13:35.804
IS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:37.706
STILL THEIR MIND SAID EVEN

03:13:37.772 --> 03:13:39.307
THOUGH THEY DO CARE.

03:13:39.374 --> 03:13:41.042
THEIR MINDSET IS STILL TEST

03:13:41.109 --> 03:13:42.410
COURSE.

03:13:42.477 --> 03:13:43.878
TEST COURSE OF COURSE OF COURSE.

03:13:43.945 --> 03:13:44.846
I DON'T CARE IF THE KID IS

03:13:44.913 --> 03:13:46.147
HUNGRY I DON'T CARE IF THE KID

03:13:46.214 --> 03:13:47.515
IN SEE PLUS MY I DON'T CARE IF

03:13:47.582 --> 03:13:49.017
THE KIDS YOU KNOW PARENTS WERE

03:13:49.084 --> 03:13:50.285
DEPORTED AND NOW HE HAD TO STAY

03:13:50.352 --> 03:13:51.286
WITH A NEIGHBOR.

03:13:51.353 --> 03:13:53.588
SO THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF FOCUS

03:13:53.655 --> 03:13:55.590
ON THAT AND EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT

03:13:55.657 --> 03:13:56.391
THE STATE.

03:13:56.458 --> 03:13:58.293
MEASURES THE THE SUCCESS OF THE

03:13:58.360 --> 03:14:02.330
SCHOOL DISTRICT BY WHAT THEY

03:14:02.397 --> 03:14:03.565
CALL NOW WITH THE DASHBOARD.

03:14:03.631 --> 03:14:04.132
WELL THAT DASHBOARD IS ALL

03:14:04.199 --> 03:14:04.566
ACADEMIC.

03:14:04.632 --> 03:14:06.634
IT MEASURES THE ACADEMICS.

03:14:06.701 --> 03:14:09.571
IT'S MEASURING -- ATTENDANCE BUT

03:14:09.637 --> 03:14:11.473
IT'S NOT MEASURE IN ANY OF THE

03:14:11.539 --> 03:14:12.807
SOCIAL INDICATORS.

03:14:12.874 --> 03:14:15.010
SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:14:15.076 --> 03:14:16.711
BIGGEST FIGHTS THAT WE HAD WITH

03:14:16.778 --> 03:14:18.113
DINNER OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I

03:14:18.179 --> 03:14:19.647
CAN'T TELL YOU THAT IT'S A 100%

03:14:19.714 --> 03:14:21.016
RESOLVED BUT I KNOW THAT WE'VE

03:14:21.082 --> 03:14:22.384
MADE GREAT STRIDES.

03:14:22.450 --> 03:14:24.319
IN JUST SAYING THAT YOU KNOW

03:14:24.386 --> 03:14:25.954
THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT

03:14:26.021 --> 03:14:27.489
SHIFT THEM AND WE'RE SEEING IT

03:14:27.555 --> 03:14:28.390
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE DATE OF

03:14:28.456 --> 03:14:30.725
THAT -- THAT THAT WE HAVE WITH

03:14:30.792 --> 03:14:31.960
YOU THROUGH THE GRANT.

03:14:32.027 --> 03:14:33.161
WHERE TEACHERS AND
