00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:02.547
PERSONALITY THAT THAT IT TAKES

00:23:02.614 --> 00:23:03.115
TO BE A LANDLORD IT'S NOT AN

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:04.282
EASY.

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:05.517
JOBS ARE.

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:07.052
JUST ONE ACCOUNT.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.132
THE MOST INTENSE.

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:21.633
HOUSING CRISIS EVER IN OUR STATE

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.301

CRISIS IN OUR SEATS HISTORY MOST

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:27.272
INTENT EVICTION CRISIS IN OUR

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:28.006
STATE'S HISTORY.

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:31.076
I'M I SUPPORTED LEGISLATION THAT --

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:34.179
THAT WAS A SIMILAR POST --

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.547
THAT IS LEGISLATION THAT DID NOT

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:37.749
MOVE FORWARD IN THIS LEGISLATURE

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:39.217

THESE ISSUES HERE IN THE

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:47.359
LEGISLATURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:49.127
THAT MAY NOT COME TO PASS --

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:51.496
AND SO WE HAVE A BALLOT MEASURE

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:53.098
AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS

00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:54.232

ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I YOU DID

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:34.105
TOUCH ON THIS A LITTLE BIT BUT I

00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:35.240
WANTED TO START OFF WITH A

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.608
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT IN OUR ON

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:37.809
OUR OFFICES ROLE IN THE

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:38.877
INITIATIVE PROCESS.

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:39.978
WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

00:24:40.045 --> 00:24:42.547
FROM OUR ROLE IN THE POLICY OF

00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:43.515
THE BUDGET PROCESS WHERE WE

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:44.382

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:46.184
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS OR COMMENT

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:48.119
ON THE MERITS OF POLICY CHANGES

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:49.654
THE ROLE GIVEN US BUT GIVEN TO

00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:51.022
US BY THE VOTERS AND THE

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:52.490
INITIATIVE PROCESS --

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:53.725
IS TO BE AN OBJECTIVE IMPARTIAL

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:55.827
THIRD PARTY OTHER FOCUSES ON

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:57.128
EVALUATING THE FISCAL EFFECTS OF

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:58.263
A MEASURE WITHOUT TAKING ANY

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.364
POSITION.

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:00.799
ON THE MERITS OF THE POLICY

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:01.600
CHANGE AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:03.501
I PREPARED A PRESENTATION FOR

00:25:03.568 --> 00:25:04.970
THE COMMITTEES TODAY.

00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:06.571
OTHER WHILE FOR SOME --

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:08.240
CONTEXT IN BACKGROUND A FOR THE

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:09.374
MEASURE DESCRIBED THE KEY

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:10.709
ASPECTS OF THE MEASURE AND

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:15.280
SUMMARIZE OUR FISCAL ANALYSIS.

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:16.681
STARTING WITH THE BACKGROUND --

00:25:16.748 --> 00:25:17.782
RENTAL HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:19.718
EXPENSIVE --

00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:21.286
THE TYPICAL RETURN CALIFORNIA

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:23.655
PAYS ABOUT 50% MORE THAN THE

00:25:23.722 --> 00:25:24.656
TYPICAL RETURN THE REST OF THE

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:26.124
COUNTRY AND IN SOME PARTS OF THE

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:26.892
STATE.

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.560
RENTS ARE MORE THAN DOUBLE --

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.262
WHAT THEY ARE THE THE NATIONAL

00:25:30.328 --> 00:25:32.330
AVERAGE --

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:33.965
IN HIGH HOUSING COSTS ARE NOT A

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.667
RECENT PHENOMENON AS EARLY AS

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:36.935
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

00:25:37.002 --> 00:25:38.303
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.604
STRUGGLED WITH HOW TO ADDRESS.

00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:42.407
HIGH HOUSING COSTS AND IN THE

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:43.541
NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES

00:25:43.608 --> 00:25:45.310
SEVERAL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:47.545
SEVERAL LARGE CITIES SUCH AS LA.

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:49.915
SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:51.316
ADOPTED LAWS KNOWN AS RENT

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:53.218
CONTROL OR RENT STABILIZATION

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:55.320
THAT LIMIT HOW MUCH RENTS

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:57.222
LANDLORDS CAN INCREASE RENTS.

00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:59.090
FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT AND

00:25:59.157 --> 00:26:00.992
OFTEN RING INCREASES ARE PAID TO

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.128
SOME MEASURE OF INFLATION.

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:05.997
SUCH AS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX.

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:08.767
TODAY ABOUT 20% OF THE STATE'S

00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:11.002
RENTAL HOUSING STOCK FALLS UNDER

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:13.939
SOME SORT OF LOCAL RENT CONTROL.

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.174
OF FOLLOWING THEPASSAGE OF THIS

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:17.442
COLLECTION OF RENT CONTROL

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:18.043
MEASURES IN THE SEVENTIES AND

00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:19.678
EIGHTIES --

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:21.146
BOTH ACTIONS BY THE STATE

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:22.347
LEGISLATURE AND BY THE COURTS OF

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:23.081
PLAY SOME --

00:26:23.148 --> 00:26:24.449
LIMITS ON THE SCOPE OF LOCAL

00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:26.484
RENT CONTROL LAWS.

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:27.619
IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:28.653
LEGISLATURE PASSED THE COSTA

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.188
HAWKINS RENTAL HOUSING ACT WHICH

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.757
PLACED THREE A KEY LIMITS ON THE

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:33.591
LOCAL RENT CONTROL.

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:35.093
FIRST IT'S A LOCAL RENT CONTROL

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.461
CANNOT APPLY TO ANY SINGLE

00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:38.196
FAMILY HOMES.

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:39.431
A SECOND LOCAL RENT CONTROL

00:26:39.497 --> 00:26:41.399
CANNOT APPLY TO ANY NEWLY BUILT

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:42.767
HOUSING --

00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:44.970
COMPLETED HONOR AFTER FEBRUARY

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:46.771
FIRST.

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:47.739
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND FINALLY

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:48.940
COSTA HAWKINS REQUIRED WHAT IS

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:50.108
KNOWN AS VACANCY TO CONTROL

00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:51.977
WHICH MEANS THAT A LANDLORD MUST

00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:53.745
BE FREE TO RESET RENTS TO MARKET

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:56.214
RATES WHEN TRANSITIONING FROM

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:56.548
ONE TEN IT --

00:26:56.614 --> 00:26:58.850
TO THE NEXT.

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.151
COURT RULINGS OF ALSO PLAY SOME

00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:01.953
LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.888
LOCAL RENT CONTROL SPECIFICALLY

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:05.390
A COLLECTION OF RULINGS HAS

00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:06.725
REQUIRED THAT LANDLORDS A BE

00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:08.927
ABLE TO RECEIVE A SO CALLED FAIR

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:10.095
RATE OF RETURN.

00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:11.196
AND WHILE THE DEFINITION OF FAIR

00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:12.430
RATE OF RETURN IS A BIT

00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:14.399
AMBIGUOUS IN CONTEXT SPECIFIC I

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.835
THINK THE THE GENERAL IDEA --

00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:17.969
IS THAT RENTS BE ALLOWED TO

00:27:18.036 --> 00:27:20.071
INCREASE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT TO

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.473
ALLOW THE LANGUAGE RETURNED TO

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:23.708
NOT BE ERODED OVER TIME --

00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:26.811
BY INFLATION.

00:27:26.878 --> 00:27:28.146
SO TURNING TO THE CHANGES

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:29.180
PROPOSED BY THE MEASURE THERE

00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:31.950
ARE TWO KEY CHANGES FIRST IS TO

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:32.951
REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS IN ITS

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:34.786
ENTIRETY --

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:36.187
THIS WOULD ALLOW --

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:38.023
LOCAL ENTITIES TO IMPOSE RENT

00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:39.891
CONTROL ON SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.593
OR HOMES CONSTRUCTED --

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:43.361
AFTER.

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:43.962
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IT WOULD

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:45.263
ALSO ALLOW LOCAL ORDINANCES TO

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.965
INCORPORATE VACANCY CONTROL

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:48.767
WHICH WOULD LIMIT HOW MUCH RENTS

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:50.502
COULD INCREASE --

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:51.870
WHEN TRANSITIONING A RENTAL UNIT

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:54.506
FROM ONE TENANT? TO THE NEXT.

00:27:54.572 --> 00:27:56.107
OF THE OTHER CHANGE IN THE

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:58.109
MEASURE IS TO PLACE INTO STATUTE

00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:00.812
THE REQUIREMENT THAT LANDLORDS --

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:02.180
BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A FAIR RATE

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:03.248
OF RETURN --

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:05.250
IN THIS IS LARGELY CODIFYING THE

00:28:05.316 --> 00:28:07.719
RESULT OF THE PAST COURT RULINGS --

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:10.889
THAT I MENTIONED.

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:12.690
I FINALLY TURNING TO OF THE

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:14.659
SUMMARY OF OUR ANALYSIS OF THE

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.628
MEASURES FISCAL FAX.

00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:17.796
I WANNA START WITH A COUNTY ARE

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:19.564
THAT WE'RE STILL FINALIZING OUR

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.132
ANALYSIS THAT WILL SHOW UP IN

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:23.001
THE VOTER GUIDE IN THE NOVEMBER

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:25.637
ELECTION VOTER MATERIALS --

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:26.304
AND SO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DISCUSS

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:28.006
OUR OUR OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:29.074
WHICH ARE LARGELY BASED ON THE

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.675
ANALYSIS WE UNDERTOOK BACK IN

00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:31.476
THE WINNER.

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:32.710
WHEN THIS MEASURE WAS THAT THE

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:35.146
TITLE AND SUMMARY STAGE --

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:36.948
WITHOUT IN MIND THE THE ECONOMIC

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:38.583
AND FISCAL EFFECTS OF THE

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.852
MEASURE WOULD DEPEND A LARGELY

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:43.388
ON FUTURE ACTIONS TAKEN BY --

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:45.390
CITIES AND COUNTIES.

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:46.724
REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS IN AND

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:48.426
OF ITSELF DOESN'T MAKE ANY

00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:49.761
CHANGES TO LOCAL RENT CONTROL

00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:50.995
ORDINANCES --

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:52.197
IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE ANY

00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.832
EXPANSION OR CREATION A NEW RING

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:55.233
CONTROL RULES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.401
THAT WOULD TAKE.

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:57.902
ADDITIONAL ACTIONS FROM LOCAL

00:28:57.969 --> 00:29:00.038
COMMUNITIES.

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:00.905
THAT BEING SAID SHOULD

00:29:00.972 --> 00:29:02.874
COMMUNITIES RESPOND TO THIS

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.042
MEASURE BY EXPANDING OR BY

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:05.443
IMPLEMENTING NEW RENT CONTROL

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.211
RULES.

00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:07.312
OF THAT HAVE A VARIETY OF

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:11.449
ECONOMIC AND FISCAL FAX --

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:13.718
BASED ON THE ECONOMIC RESEARCH

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:14.819
OF THE MOST LIKELY ECONOMIC

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:17.622
EFFECTS ARE THE FOLLOWING FIRST

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:19.357
SOME LANDLORDS --

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:20.992
WOULD CONVERT THEIR RENTAL

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:22.760
PROPERTIES TWO CONDOS OR OTHER

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:24.529
FORMS OF OWNERSHIP HOUSING IN

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:26.297
THIS WOULD SHIFT THE COMPOSITION

00:29:26.364 --> 00:29:27.332
OF THE HOUSING STOCK IN ANY

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:28.833
COMMUNITY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.168
RENTALS AVAILABLE.

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:31.936
AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.905
UNITS THAT ARE FOR SALE --

00:29:33.972 --> 00:29:37.175
SECOND THE VALUE OF RENTAL

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:38.243
HOUSING WOULD DECLINE AS

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.912
PROSPECTIVE LANDLORDS WOULD BE

00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:42.247
WILLING TO PAY LESS FOR RENT

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:42.847
CONTROLLED --

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:45.216
UNITS.

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:47.886
A THIRD A SO RENTERS IN RENT

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:49.654
CONTROLLED UNITS WOULD SPEND

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:51.456
LESS ON RENTS AND THEIR

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:52.590
LANDLORDS WOULD RECEIVE LESS

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:52.891
[inaudible]

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.626
RENTAL INCOME.

00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:56.394
AND FINALLY RENTERS WOULD --

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.530
MOVE LESS OFTEN THIS WOULD

00:29:58.596 --> 00:29:59.564
INCLUDE --

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:00.999
FEWER INVOLUNTARY MOVES --

00:30:01.065 --> 00:30:02.901
WHERE RENTERS --

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:04.269
ARE ESSENTIALLY FORCED TO MOVE

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:05.336
BY A RENT INCREASE THAT THEY

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:07.272
CAN'T AFFORD AND IT COULD ALSO

00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:08.206
INCLUDE --

00:30:08.273 --> 00:30:09.440
SUMMER TRIPS FOR GOING A MOVE

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:11.509
THAT MAY BE OTHERWISE ADVANTAGES

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:13.011
FOR THEM TO MOVE CLOSER WORKER

00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:14.812
FAMILY OF A DAY FOR GO THAT MOVE

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:17.015
TO MAINTAIN THE RELATIVELY LOW

00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:17.615
RENT OF THEIR RENT CONTROLLED

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:17.916
[inaudible]

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:19.918
UNIT.

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:21.152
OF THESE ECONOMIC EFFECTS COULD

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:24.022
HAVE A DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS

00:30:24.088 --> 00:30:25.623
FOR OF VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.158
REVENUES.

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:29.027
THE ULTIMATE MAGNITUDE OF THESE

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:30.562
EFFECTS ON STATE LOCAL REVENUES

00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:32.864
ARE UNCLEAR IS THEY WOULD --

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:35.266
LARGELY DEPEND ON THAT THE TYPE

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:37.302
AND TIMING OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY

00:30:37.368 --> 00:30:39.637
LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN RESPONSE TO

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:41.706
THE REPEAL OF COSTA HAWKINS.

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:44.576
HOWEVER THE IN GENERAL WE SEE

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:45.977
THREE MAJOR CHANGES THE STATE

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:47.612
LOCAL REVENUES FIRST A LANDLORDS

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.547
WOULD PAY A LET'S PROPERTY TAXES

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:50.615
AS THE VALUE OF THEIR RENTAL

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:52.250
PROPERTIES --

00:30:52.317 --> 00:30:54.219
WOULD GO DOWN.

00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:56.254
SECOND RANGERS WOULD HAVE

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:57.922
INCREASED DISPOSABLE INCOME.

00:30:57.989 --> 00:30:59.390
SOME OF WHICH THEY WOULD SPEND

00:30:59.457 --> 00:31:01.793
ON TAXABLE GOODS AND THIS WOULD

00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:04.395
LEAD TO A MORE SALES TAX REVENUE.

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:07.632
AND FINALLY A LANDLORDS A

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:08.566
PERSONAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:10.435
WOULD CHANGE --

00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:12.203
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD GO UP

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.371
OR DOWN --

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:14.872
IS DIFFICULT THE SAME IT DEPENDS

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:16.074
SOMEWHAT ON WHETHER OR NOT

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.675
YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THE SHORT

00:31:17.742 --> 00:31:18.710
TERM.

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:19.978
OR THE LONG TERM --

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:21.346
THAT THEIR SEVERAL MOVING PIECES

00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:22.580
WITHIN THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:24.749
FEES ON THE ONE HAND LANDLORDS

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:26.217
WOULD BE RECEIVING LESS RENTAL

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:27.218
INCOME AND THEREFORE THEIR

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:28.486
TAXABLE INCOME WOULD BE LOWER

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:29.854
AND THEY WOULD PAY LOWER INCOME

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.289
TAX BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:32.657
ON THE OTHER HAND LANDLORDS

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:35.059
RECEIVE A VARIETY OF DEDUCTIONS

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:37.295
AGAINST THEIR TAXABLE INCOME

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:38.930
OTHER BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:40.431
PROPERTY SUCH AS PROPERTY TAX

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:41.666
DEDUCTION MORTGAGE INTEREST

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:42.967
DEDUCTION --

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:46.638
AND APPRECIATION OF ALL OF IF

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:47.639
LANDLORDS WERE PAYING LESS TO

00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:49.807
ACQUIRE PROPERTY ON THIS

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:51.242
REDUCTION IN THESE DEDUCTIONS

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:52.410
WOULD IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:53.411
INCREASE THE TAXABLE INCOME OF

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:54.846
LANDLORDS.

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:56.581
AND LEADS THEM PAYING HIGHER

00:31:56.648 --> 00:31:58.082
INCOME TAX PAYMENTS OF THE THE

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:59.284
OVERALL NET EFFECT OF THESE

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.952
MOVING PIECES IS NOT CLEAR

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.287
ESPECIALLY --

00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:04.856
AND THE LONG TERM.

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:05.690
TAKING ALL THE STATE AND LOCAL

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:07.992
REVENUE AFFECTS TOGETHER.

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:10.862
AGAIN THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE --

00:32:10.928 --> 00:32:12.397
IS IS -- IS

00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:14.932
UNCLEAR I AM WHEN LARGELY DEPEND

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:18.036
ON THE TYPE AND TIMING OF LOCAL

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:19.137
OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY LOCAL

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:20.938
GOVERNMENTS FOLLOWING THE

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:23.141
PASSAGE OF THIS MEASURE --

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:24.542
AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.778
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.

00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:29.047
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ME ASK IF

00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:29.614
THERE ANY QUESTIONS CENTER

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:30.481
WIECKOWSKI.

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:31.149
I'M ON THE CHANGES OF STATE AND

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:32.517
LOCAL REVENUES HELP ME OUT HERE

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.285
BECAUSE PROPERTY REAL PROPERTY

00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:35.920
TAXES ARE SAYS BY THE COUNTY

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:37.155
ASSESSOR.

00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:39.390
SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT SOME PART

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:40.858
IN OUR COMPLEXES HAVE BEEN

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:42.527
ARTIFICIALLY LOW ON THE

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:44.162
ASSESSMENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE

00:32:44.228 --> 00:32:45.463
PROP THIRTEEN AND THEY'VE THEY

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.031
GOT THEY GOT A SPECIAL TREAT

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:49.000
BACK IN.

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:49.567
NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SO IF

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:51.436
THEY IF THEY ACTUALLY HAD THE

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:53.271
AUDACITY TO GO INTO THE ASSESSOR

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.206
AND CHALLENGE THE ASSESSED VALUE

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:56.507
OF THEIR PROPERTY DOZEN THAT

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:58.076
OPEN THE DOOR FOR THE ASSESSOR

00:32:58.142 --> 00:32:59.377
TO LOOK AT THE TRUE VALUE.

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:00.745
OF THAT BUILDING IF THEY'RE

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:01.546
GOING TO SAY THAT THEY'VE LOST

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:02.780
INCOME THAT COMMERCIAL

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:05.116
PROPERTIES WORTH LESS BECAUSE IF

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:07.218
I MAKE LESS IS AN ATTORNEY I

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:08.019
DON'T GO TO THE ASSESSMENT SAY

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:10.822
HEY MY BUILDINGS WORTH LESS.

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:11.556
WALK ME THROUGH THAT HOW THAT

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:13.491
WILL HELP WITH THAT WORK.

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:15.993
SO YOU'RE CERTAINLY RIGHT THAT --

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.428
THERE WOULD BE THERE WOULD BE

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:20.531
SIGNIFICANT LAG IN THE EFFECT OF

00:33:20.598 --> 00:33:21.999
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:23.901
A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:25.737
A RENTAL PROPERTY AND THE

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:27.171
DECLINE IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE

00:33:27.238 --> 00:33:28.239
REAL PROPERTY --

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:29.640
AND NOT LIKE IT'S CREATED BY

00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:31.142
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN AND

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:32.810
ESSENTIALLY UP FOR MOST

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:34.178
PROPERTIES --

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:35.380
EVEN IF --

00:33:35.446 --> 00:33:36.581
YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:37.615
MEASURE PASSES THERE SOME

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.350
DECLINE IN THEIR MARKET VALUE

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:40.485
FOR MOST OF THOSE PROPERTIES

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:41.552
THEY WOULDN'T SEE A DECLINE IN

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:42.153
THEIR SUSSMAN BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.154
CORRECT.

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:44.055
MOST PROPERTIES ARE SUCH THAT

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:46.924
SOMETHING WELL --

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.926
THAT BEING SAID SOME PROPERTIES

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:50.895
WOULD TURN OVER EACH YEAR AND

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:52.296
AND THEIR SALE PRICE WOULD BE

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:55.266
LOWER THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE --

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:57.268
AND SO THEY WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.203
ENROLLED AT A LOWER SALE PRICE

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.571
AND GOING FORWARD WOULD BE TAXED

00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:02.173
SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THEY WOULD

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.141
HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE THAT MAKE

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:04.809
SENSE.

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.310
TRUE BUT WOULDN'T WE GET WITH

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:07.745
THEM WE GET THE TRUE UP THE

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:09.647
FIRST TIME THAT AT SOUL BECAUSE

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:11.716
BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS PAYING

00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:13.451
PROPERTY TAXES AND LET'S GO BACK

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:15.319
TO ITS NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN ON

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:15.953
A BUILDING THAT THEY FOUGHT FOR

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.122
A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:18.656
THAT'S WORTH THREE MILLION

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:19.724
DOLLARS IN.

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.692
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHOOSE IN MY AREA

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:23.861
SO THEN THAT FIRST PERSON THAT

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:26.297
PAID THAT THE THREE MILLION

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:27.432
DOLLARS.

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:29.667
THEY WOULD BE PAYING. THIRTY

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:30.268
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PROPERTY

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:31.502
TAXES WITH THE OTHER GUYS ONLY

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:34.705
PAN A GRAND NOW THE SECOND SALE

00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:36.307
WHERE THAT NOW THOUGH REN HAS

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:37.074
BEEN.

00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:38.876
DEPRECIATED VER AND THEY SELL

00:34:38.943 --> 00:34:40.711
THAT THEY OFFLOAD THAT PROPERTY

00:34:40.778 --> 00:34:42.580
FOR TWO POINT SEVEN I AGREE WITH

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.348
YOUR ANALYSIS THAT THE OUT WITH.

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:46.350
IN THE LARGE PICTURE BUT THE

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:49.187
TRUE UP OF SO MANY RENTAL

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:51.355
PROPERTIES THAT ARE THE MARK THE

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:53.424
ASSESSED VALUE SO LOW TO THE

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:54.859
MARKET VALUE.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:55.760
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:58.896
THAT THAT FIRST SALE IS GOING TO

00:34:58.963 --> 00:34:59.497
BE.

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:02.166
A A A A POSSIBLE INCREASE IN

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:03.901
PROPERTY TAXES BECAUSE THEY

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:05.203
ARTIFICIALLY LOW THAT'S MY

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:08.172
OBSERVATION.

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:08.506
SO I THINK --

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:10.141
WHAT YOU'RE ARGUING I WOULD BE

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:12.910
TRUE IF WE EXPECTED OF THE --

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:14.846
THE REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS TO LEAD

00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:16.447
TO AN INCREASE IN LANDLORDS ARE

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:17.582
SELLING THEIR PROPERTIES AND I

00:35:17.648 --> 00:35:19.217
THINK SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT I

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:21.519
DON'T THINK IT'S THAT WE HAVE

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:22.253
ENOUGH -- IN

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:22.854
OF IT --

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.689
INCURABLE RESEARCH TO JUSTIFY

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:26.491
ONE ASSUMPTION OR THE OTHER IF

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:27.558
THERE WERE AN INCREASE IN THE

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:28.826
NUMBER LIMITS ON PROPERTIES I

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.261
THINK YOU WOULD BE RIGHT EVEN IF

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:32.196
THEY WERE SELLING FOR LESS THAN

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:33.197
THAT THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD.

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:34.699
JUST THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE MORE

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:35.666
TURNOVER.

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:36.200
COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:39.370
IMPROPER WHAT WE WOULD EVER SEE

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:40.404
BUT I THINK --

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.639
I WE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:42.273
ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE THAT

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.076
KIND OF ASSUMPTION [inaudible]

00:35:45.142 --> 00:35:47.879
SAM LOOKED [inaudible]

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:50.948

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:56.754

00:48:27.437 --> 00:48:29.406
LOCAL ECONOMIES.

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:31.275
AND SINCE THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT

00:48:31.341 --> 00:48:32.542
WAS PASSED IN.

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:33.343
NINETY FIVE THE WORD CRISIS IS

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.412
GOTTEN WORSE.

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:36.680
THERE ARE THREE MAJOR PROVISIONS

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.015
AS YOU'VE HEARD OF THE COSTA

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:40.717
HAWKINS ACT THERE ARE OBSTACLES

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.586
TO ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS.

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:44.187
THE FIRST IS COSTA HAWKINS

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:46.156
PREVENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:49.026
ACTING MEANINGFUL RENT CONTROL.

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:50.060
BECAUSE THE KIDS AT PROHIBITS

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:51.328
CITIES FROM REGULATING RENTS

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:52.763
WHEN A UNIT BECOMES VACANT.

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:54.531
THIS CREATES A PERVERSE

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.933
INCENTIVE FOR A LANDLORD THREE

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.535
VIC TENANTS OFTEN BY ILLEGAL

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:01.038
MEANS ACCORDING HARASSED AND

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:02.973
THIS HAPPENS ALL OVER THE STATE.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.775
EVEN THE STRONGEST FORMS OF RENT

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:05.776
CONTROL THOUGH DO NOT FREEZE

00:49:05.842 --> 00:49:09.313
RENTS RECKON TROLL ALL HOURS.

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:12.082
WHEN WORDS TO STEADILY INCREASE

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:14.551
THEIR RENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS --

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:17.454
GET A FAIR RETURN BASED ON SOME

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:19.356
FORMULA THAT CITY SET --

00:49:19.423 --> 00:49:20.691
WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT

00:49:20.757 --> 00:49:22.893
GOVERNMENT CAN AND SHOULD PLAY

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:24.728
SOME CONTROLS ON LOCAL PUBLIC

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:27.731
UTILITIES ELECTRICITY GAS AND

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.666
WATER -- AND

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:31.301
HOUSING IS ALSO A BASIC

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:33.303
NECESSITY SO IT'S TIME TO

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.705
RESTORE THE ABILITY OF LOCAL

00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:36.973
GOVERNMENTS TO REGULATE RENTS

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:37.274
[inaudible]

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.042
SECOND.

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.711
THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT PROHIBITS

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:41.812
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:43.046
REGULATING RENTS ON RENTAL

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:46.016
HOUSING THAT WAS BUILT AFTER.

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:46.550
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE COSTA

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:47.551
HAWKINS WAS PASSED TWENTY THREE

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:49.519
YEARS AGO.

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:50.887
BUT THE DATE FOR EXEMPTING NEW

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:52.155
CONSTRUCTION SO CALLED NEW

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:53.357
CONSTRUCTION HASN'T CHANGED

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:55.025
SINCE THEN.

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.527
BECAUSE THE COSTA HAWKINS IN LA --

00:49:57.594 --> 00:50:00.030
ANY UNIT BUILDING AFTER NINETEEN

00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:01.064
SEVENTY EIGHT IS EXEMPT FROM ANY

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:03.100
RIGHT REGULATIONS BUT THE

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:06.269
MORTGAGES ON THESE OLDER HOUSING

00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:08.338
RENTAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENTSHAVE

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:10.474
BEEN PAID OFF OR A SMALL PART.

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.141
OF THE BUILDINGS OPERATING

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:14.211
BUDGETS SO THERE ISN'T A SINGLE

00:50:14.277 --> 00:50:16.380
CITY IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:17.247
RENT CONTROL COVERS NEW

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:19.383
CONSTRUCTION.

00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:21.084
EVERY CALIFORNIA CITY THAT

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:23.653
ADOPTED SOME FORMER RENT CONTROL.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.723
PRIOR TO THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.025
EXEMPTED NEW CONSTRUCTION EVEN

00:50:29.092 --> 00:50:30.460
WITHOUT THERE BEING A PRO NO

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.429
PROHIBITION ON IT.

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:35.332
CITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADOPT A

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:38.034
SUNSET PROVISION SO THAT SAY

00:50:38.101 --> 00:50:39.469
TWENTY YEARS AFTER RENTAL

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:41.304
BUILDING IS BUILT LOCAL

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:41.872
GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE THE

00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:44.841
AUTHORITY. TO REGULATE RENTS.

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:46.777
THIRD THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT TIES

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:48.512
THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:50.580
FROM DEALING WITH WHAT I CALL

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:52.249
THE BLACKSTONE PROBLEM.

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:54.951
SINCE THE MORTGAGE CRISIS OF TWO

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:56.453
THOUSAND AND EIGHT LARGE WALL

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.188
STREET FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

00:50:58.255 --> 00:51:00.123
LIKE THE GLOBAL PRIVATE EQUITY

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.958
FIRM BLACKSTONE OF GOBBLED UP

00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:03.960
MILLIONS OF SINGLE FOR A

00:51:04.027 --> 00:51:06.563
FORKLIFT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.332
AND CALIFORNIA IS GROUND.

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:11.735
ZERO IN THE WALL STREET ABSENTEE

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:13.870
CORPORATE WHEN OR TREND.

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:15.972
ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE RENTAL

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:19.242
UNITS IN CALIFORNIA. TWENTY TWO

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:20.343
POINT TWO MILLION OUT OF SIX MY

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.978
RENTAL UNITS ARE SINGLE FAMILY

00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:23.947
BUILDINGS.

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:25.849
SO LOCAL JURISDICTION SHOULD BE

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:27.517
ABLE TO REGULATE RENTS FOR A

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:29.453
LARGE CORPORATE ABSENTEE

00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:31.955
LANDLORDS WITH LARGE INVENTORIES

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:34.257
OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.

00:51:34.324 --> 00:51:35.659
WE GIVE YOU FIVE REASONS FOR

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:38.929
REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS --

00:51:38.995 --> 00:51:40.664
THE LA OH REPORT DOWNPLAYS THE

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:43.500
POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND

00:51:43.567 --> 00:51:45.202
THE COST SAVINGS OF CITIES ADOPT

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:46.937
STRONGER RENT CONTROL SO WHAT

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:48.238
THE HIGHWAY WHAT I CONSIDER TO

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:50.373
BE THE FIVE ABOUT REASONS TO

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.675
REPEAL IT FIRST.

00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:53.210
RENT CONTROL IS GOOD FOR THE

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:54.811
ECONOMY.

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:56.613
IT WILL PUT MONEY BACK IN THE

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.648
LOCAL ECONOMY --

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.884
IF UP MANY WORDS ARE OF LIMITED

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.152
FROM EXCESSIVE RATE INCREASES

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:03.553
TENANTS WILL HAVE MORE MONEY TO

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.421
SPEND.

00:52:04.488 --> 00:52:05.956
THEY WILL SPEND ALMOST ALL OF

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:08.124
THEIR MONEY IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:10.060
DOUBLE BOOST LOCAL BUSINESSES

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:12.496
INCREASE LOCAL SALES TAXES.

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:13.830
AND INCREASED JOBS FOR

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:15.699
BUSINESSES TO PROSPER AS A

00:52:15.765 --> 00:52:16.967
RESULT OF THE ADDITIONAL

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.668
CONSUMER DEMAND [inaudible]

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:22.005
ALSO CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS CANNOT

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:24.508
THRIVE IF PEOPLE CAN'T FIND A

00:52:24.574 --> 00:52:26.243
PLACE TO LIVE CLOSE TO WORK.

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:27.744
CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE MOVING

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:28.745
FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.847
THEIR JOBS IT'S HARD TO ATTRACT

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:32.582
PEOPLE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:33.783
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.018
RENTAL AND HOME OWNERSHIP

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.686
HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE I RECENTLY

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:37.954
CONDUCTED.

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:40.557
A SURVEY OF DISNEYLAND EMPLOYEES

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:42.726
THAT IN ANAHEIM ON ALMOST ONE

00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:44.861
THIRD OF THEM COMMUTE MORE THAN

00:52:44.928 --> 00:52:45.996
TWO HOURS A DAY GETTING TO AND

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.764
FROM WORK.

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:49.266
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:51.501
OF HOUSING IN ORANGE COUNTY

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:51.801
[inaudible]

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.303
SECOND REASON.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.138
DEVELOPERS MAY NOT REALIZE HOW

00:52:55.205 --> 00:52:56.940
RENT CONTROL ACTUALLY INCREASES

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:59.676
THE DEMAND FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:01.444
IF CITIES HAVE RENT CONTROL THE

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:03.213
PROTECT TENANTS IN EXISTING

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.748
BUILDINGS.

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.316
THE YOU HAVE TO BUILD MORE FOR

00:53:06.383 --> 00:53:08.018
THE AFFLUENT TENANTS WHO WANT TO

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.953
MOVE INTO THE AREA RENT CONTROL

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.822
ENCOURAGES NEW CONSTRUCTION BY

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:15.358
CHANNELING HIGHER INCOME WORKERS.

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:17.360
INTO THE MARKET FOR NEWLY BUILT

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:18.962
APARTMENTS RATHER THAN ALLOWING

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.764
THEM TO DISPLACE THE SITTING

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.699
TENANTS FROM EXISTING HOUSING

00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:22.999
[inaudible]

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:24.501
THIRD.

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:26.970
pRENT CONTROL WILL SAVE MANY

00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:29.339
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS THE

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:31.141
STATE GOVERNMENT A GREAT DEAL OF

00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:33.076
MONEY THAT THEY NOW SPEND

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.344
ADDRESSING THE GROWING PROBLEM

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:36.046
OF HOMELESSNESS.

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:38.014
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IT IS LESS

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:41.418
COSTLY TO PREVENT A PROBLEM THEN

00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:43.219
TO ADDRESS IT AFTER IT HAS

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:45.589
BECOME A SERIOUS CRISIS.

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.991
STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:49.759
GOVERNMENTS SPEND A SIGNIFICANT

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:50.961
AMOUNT OF FUNDING ON LAW

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:11.781
ZILLOW RECENTLY DID A STUDY THAT

00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:14.651

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:22.726
SO BY REDUCING HOMELESSNESS RENT

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:25.428

00:55:23.787 --> 00:55:25.889
THE ALMOST POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS

00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:27.424
THAT COMES FROM BEING AFRAID OF

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.225
BEING A VICTIM OR BEING EVICTED --

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:30.760
AND AND WINDING UP ON THE STREET

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.896
OR NOT KNOWING WHERE YOU'RE

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:34.197
GOING AND FINALLY.

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:36.066
REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS IS ABOUT

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:37.600
LOCAL CONTROL OF THE HEART COSTA

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.769

CONTROL FIRST THE IDEA THAT RENT

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:57.587
CONTROL WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE

00:55:57.654 --> 00:56:00.457
FISCAL IMPACT ON CITIES IS VERY

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:01.591
MISLEADING.

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:02.759
THE SIMPLE PASSAGE OF THE BALLOT

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:05.962
MEASURE TO REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:08.231
WILL HAVE NO PHYSICAL IN.

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:09.466
IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT LOCAL

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:11.534
GOVERNMENTS DO IF ANYTHING.

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:13.269
ANY ANALYSIS OF THE FISCAL

00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:15.939
IMPACT ALSO HAS TO LOOK.

00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:17.474
AT THE RESULTING INCREASE IN

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.076
SALES TAX REVENUES THE SAVINGS

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:21.911
TO LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT

00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:23.580
FROM THE REDUCE COST TO ADDRESS

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:24.447
HOMELESSNESS.

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:26.015
AND THE COST OF ADDRESSING THE

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:27.650
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:30.386
CONSEQUENCES HOUSING INSECURITY

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:31.688
INSTABILITY AND DISPLACEMENT

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:31.988
[inaudible]

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.223
AND SECOND.

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:35.091
THERE'S A MYTH.

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:37.227
THE WEEKEND QUICKLY BUILD OUR

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:38.394
WAY OUT OF CALIFORNIA'S SEVERE

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:41.798
HOUSING CRISIS EIGHT CD PROJECTS

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.099
THAT THE STATE WILL NEED ONE

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:45.769
POINT EIGHT MILLION NEW HOUSING

00:56:45.835 --> 00:56:47.337
UNITS TO MEET PROJECTED.

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:49.305
POPULATION AND HOUSEHOLD GROWTH

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:51.541
THAT'S MORE THAN TWICE THE PACE

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:52.709
OF NEW CONSTRUCTION OVER THE

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:54.177
LAST TEN YEARS.

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:55.712
BUT EVEN THAT FIGURE IS

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:57.213
MISLEADING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.848
INCLUDE THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:00.917
HOUSING CONCERNS OF THOSE WHO

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:02.886
CAN'T AFFORD MARKET RENTS.

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:04.788
SO EVEN IF WE MARSHALL THE

00:57:04.854 --> 00:57:06.289
POLITICAL WILL TO DO SO.

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:08.892
CONSTRUCTING NEW HOUSING THAT WE

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:12.195
NEED WILL TAKE DECADES AND ONLY

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:14.230
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE

00:57:14.297 --> 00:57:16.032
PRACTICE OF RESTRICTIVE

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:18.301
EXCLUSIONARY ZONING THAT LIMITS

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:19.969
NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND IS

00:57:20.036 --> 00:57:21.304
THE PRIMARY CAUSE.

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:23.072
OF THE HOUSING SHORTAGE.

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:24.841
SO WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SUPPLY

00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:26.976
CATCHES UP.

00:57:27.043 --> 00:57:28.945
OR TRICKLES DOWN EXCESSIVE RENT

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.947
INCREASES ARE EXTREMELY ARE

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:33.183
CAUSING EXTREME HARDSHIP NOW

00:57:33.249 --> 00:57:35.051
ONLY RENT CONTROL CAN PROVIDE

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.820
SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF.

00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:39.589
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ONE QUARTER

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:40.857
OF ALL THE FAMILIES WHO WERE

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:43.293
ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:44.527
ACCORDING TO HOOK ONLY ONE

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.896
QUARTER RECEIVE ANY HOUSING

00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:48.531
SUBSIDY IT'S NOT AN ENTITLEMENT.

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:50.133
SO EVEN IF WE HAD ENOUGH FEDERAL

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.702
HOUSING VOUCHERS FOR EVERY

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.437

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:56.873
VOUCHER WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.608
APARTMENTS FOR THEM TO RENT.

00:57:58.675 --> 00:57:59.609
IT'S LIKE GIVING PEOPLE FOOD

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:02.111
STAMPS WHEN THE SUPERMARKET

PRESERVE THE EXISTING SUPPLY OF

HOUSING AND RENT CONTROL IS ONE

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:20.697
WAY TO DO THAT THE LANDLORD

00:58:20.763 --> 00:58:21.764
LOBBY.

THE TRUTH ABOUT RENT CONTROL

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:32.342
IT'S NOT THE PANACEA BUT IT IS

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:33.643
ONE SOLUTION THAT LOCAL

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.411

THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR FAMILIES

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:54.143
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR OUR

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.912
ENVIRONMENT.

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:57.013
BUT WE ARE WORKING ON AND

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.614
HELPING TO FINANCE AFFORDABLE

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:03.486
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS PEOPLE ARE

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.120
BEING PUSHED OUT OF THEIR HOMES

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:20.269
TODAY

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:38.821

OVER A DOZEN A DOZEN OTHER

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:03.112
CITIES THAT HAVE SOME SORT OF

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:04.480

WE REPRESENT TO ALLOW THEM TO

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:12.088
STAY IN THEIR HOMES.

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:13.156
IN OAKLAND I COULD SEE

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:15.758
SUPPORTING A ROLLING SYSTEM

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.093

TWENTY YEARS NEWER CONSTRUCTION

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:22.398
WOULD EVENTUALLY FALL UNDER RENT

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.032
CONTROL.

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.705

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.542

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.143

DO.

EVEN AS WE BUILD NEW HOUSING.

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.990
WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR EXISTING

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:49.058
RENTERS FROM THE VERY REAL RISK

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.760

01:04:58.494 --> 01:04:59.328
IN MY PERSONAL TIME I'M A

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:00.596
LANDLORD.

AND I'VE OWNED UP TO EIGHT

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:05.668
PROPERTIES IN MY PAST --

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.937
IN ALL MY YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:09.605
I'VE SEEN MANY BOOMS AND BUSTS

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:10.940
IN THE HOUSING MARKET.

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:13.109
FROM THE FALLOUT OF THE DOT COM

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:13.576
BUBBLE.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.177
IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS TO

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:16.579
THE GREAT RECESSION TO THE

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:18.180
CURRENT MARKET.

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:19.615
I'VE I'VE COME TO THE BELIEF

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:22.385
THAT RENT CONTROL IS NOT ONLY

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:24.720
THE MORAL THING TO DO IT'S ALSO

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:27.256
THE SMART THING TO DO.

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:30.092
ACOSTA HAWKINS IS A MAJOR THOUGH

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:31.761
NOT THE ONLY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:33.629
HOUSING CRISIS.

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:35.364
THE VAST MAJORITY OF LANDLORDS

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:38.301
ARE ARE GOOD ACTORS BUT COSTA

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:40.202
HAWKINS GIVES LATITUDE. TO THE

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:42.738
BAD ACTORS TO ACT POORLY AND

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.206
REPEALING IT WOULD GIVE LOCAL

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:46.075
MUNICIPALITIES.

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:47.443
THE AUTHORITY TERRAIN THE MEN

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:48.778
AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:50.980
STRONGER.

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.983
I HAVE SEEN SAN MATEO COUNTY.

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:55.551
OVERRUN WITHOUT OF TOWN

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.787
LANDLORDS AS OF LATE.

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:59.388
THEY HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:02.124
COMMUNITY BUT THEY ARE IMPACTING

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:03.492
THE COMMUNITY SEVERELY.

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:05.461
I'VE SEEN NURSES FIREFIGHTERS

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.897
TEACHERS SERVICE WORKERS AND

01:06:07.963 --> 01:06:10.099
THEIR CHILDREN RUN OUT OF TOWN

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:11.434
BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.135
AFFORD TO KEEP UP WITH THE HIGH

01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:14.637
RENTS THAT ARE BEING PLACED ON

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.072
THEM.

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:17.606
THIS IS AN UNSUSTAINABLE

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.809
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM THAT'S TO

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:21.811
THE DETRIMENT OF EVERYONE.

01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:24.213
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE MARKET CRASH

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.681
WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:26.816
EVENTUALLY.

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:27.883
THEN YOU WILL HAVE NOBODY LIVING

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.586
IN THE COMMUNITY FOR EMERGENCIES

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.421
TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY TO

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.624
TEACH OUR CHILDREN ACCEPT IRA.

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:36.992
THAT WILL SINK THE VALUE OF OUR

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:38.961
COMMUNITIES EVEN FURTHER HIGH

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:40.629
RENTS CAN'T LAST FOREVERBUT

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.298
THEY HAVE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.200
WHEN THEY'RE ENACTED.

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:45.868
IN MY EXPERIENCE TOO MANY REAL

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.937
ESTATE INVESTORS BUYING HOMES

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:50.539
NOW ARE IN IT FOR THE SHORT TERM

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:52.608
GAIN NOT FOR THE TRADITIONAL

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.743
STABILITY.

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:56.612
THAT PURCHASING HOUSING BRINGS.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.781
TRADITIONALLY INVEST INVESTORS

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.916
ABOUT HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S A

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.551
GOOD STABLE INVESTMENT.

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.653
THEIR PROPERTY TAXES REMAIN

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.123
STABLE BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.057
THIRTEEN AND IF THEY'RE IN

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:09.925
DESIRABLE AREAS THEY WILL

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:11.327
CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND THAT'S

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:13.529
FOR YEARS TO COME.

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:18.067
REAL ESTATE INVESTORS WILL HAVE

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:18.601
STABLE SOURCES OF INCOME.

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.970
WHEN REAL ESTATE INVESTORS TALK

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:23.272
ABOUT PAIN I THINK WE SHOULD

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.241
NECESSARILY DIFFERENTIATE THE

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:27.343
KIND OF PAIN THEY'RE TALKING

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:30.012
ABOUT FROM THE PAIN OF PEOPLE?

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:33.115
THAT ARE IN THE PROBLEMATIC

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:34.550
SITUATION OF BEING THROWN INTO

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:37.086
THE STREET.

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.187
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:39.455
WANTING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:41.457
BUT WHEN THAT DESIRE IMPACTS

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.192
PEOPLE'S ABILITIES TO LIVE AND

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.227
WORK IN A GEOGRAPHIC THAT'S

01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:46.996
ALREADY IN CRISIS WE HAVE A

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:47.897
PROBLEM.

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:50.166
REMEMBER THESE LANDLORDS THAT

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:53.702
MAY COMPLAIN A ARE ABLE TO TEN

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:54.904
THIRTY WHEN THEIR PROPERTIES

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:56.972
INTO OTHER AREAS THAT ARE NOT

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:59.508
SUFFERING IMMEDIATE CRISIS.

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.010
THOUGH I AM PERSONALLY NOT

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:03.145
IMPACTED BY RENT CONTROL AS THE

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:05.347
OWNER OF MY PROPERTIES I DO KEEP

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:07.216
MY RENT STABLE ON MY OWN

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:08.784
PROPERTIES BECAUSE CHANGING

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.119
TENANTS ALL THE TIME.

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:11.954
AND PRICE GOUGING PEOPLE IS NOT

01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:14.824
MY IDEA OF GOOD BUSINESS.

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.459
WHEN YOU HAVE TO SWITCH BETWEEN

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:18.494
TENETS YOU TEND TO HAVE SOME

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:20.863
DEAD TIME OR VACANCY TIME?

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.998
THEN YOU HAVE TO TEND TO THE

01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:24.600
FIXES IT YOUR PREVIOUS TENANTS

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.702
MAY NOT HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THEN

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.337
ONCE YOU GET A NEW TENANT YOU'RE

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.405
GUESSING IF THEY WILL BE A

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:30.706
PROBLEM OR NOT.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.275
IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S EASIER TO

01:08:33.342 --> 01:08:35.244
LOVE THE ONES YOU'RE WITH THEN

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:36.579
REYES RANCH.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:40.416
AND CONTINUOUSLY GET A REVOLT.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:43.018
REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS SIMPLY

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:45.688
TURNS POWER TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:47.623
TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEM AND

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:48.591
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:50.726
ABOUT HERE PRESERVING THE POWER

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.495

THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:15.878
MISTER CHAIRMAN.

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:17.913
UP MY NAME IS DEBORAH CARLSON I

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.315
AM THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.583
THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:22.518
ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:24.119
APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:25.721
RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS AND

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.222
MANAGERS WHO OPERATE.

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:29.191
APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION UNITS

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:29.692
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:30.759
CALIFORNIA.

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:33.128
THIS MORNING I WANT TO FOCUS ON

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:34.196
THREE AREAS CONCERNING THE

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:35.497
INITIATIVE.

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:37.533
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACT.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.634
FIRST OF ALL THE WARNINGS THAT

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:40.402
WE'VE RECEIVED FROM ECONOMISTS

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:41.437
AND THE STATE LEGISLATIVE

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:42.771
ANALYST'S OFFICE ABOUT THE

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:43.706
IMPOSITION OF STRICT RENT

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:47.109
CONTROL. TO ALSO THAT THIS

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.811
INITIATIVE WERE AND WHAT IT WILL

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:49.878
DO.

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.413
A WHEN IT COMES TO LAWSUITS AND

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.748
THE COSTS ON THE STATE OF

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:53.983
CALIFORNIA.

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:56.485
AND FINALLY THE INABILITY FOR

01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:58.587
STATE LAWMAKERS TO CORRECT ANY

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:01.056
PROBLEMS THAT COME AS A RESULT.

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:02.057
OF THE PASSAGE OF THIS

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:03.692
INITIATIVE.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:05.628
SO FIRST THE WARNINGS.

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:07.663
I THERE IS NOT ONE CREDIBLE

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.365
ECONOMIST OR STUDY THAT HAS

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:11.233
REPORTED THAT STRINGENT RENT

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.802
CONTROL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA.

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:15.938
IT WON'T HELP EMPLOYERS RECRUIT

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.173
EMPLOYEES AND IT WON'T CREATE

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:18.907
NEW.

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:21.210
AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:22.378
ACCORDING TO THE LA SHOW AND

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.413
OTHER STUDIES ON RENT CONTROL

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.248
THEY STRONGLY SUGGEST.

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:27.950
THAT THIS INITIATIVE WHICH

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:29.652
INTENDS TO ELIMINATE THE STATE'S

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:31.153
COSTA HAWKINS RENTAL HOUSING ACT

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.821
WELL REDUCE THE EXISTING STOCK

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:34.723
OF RENTAL HOUSING.

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:36.358
WILL INCREASE RENTS IN

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:38.227
NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:40.295
WELL TURNED HOUSING OVER TO

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:42.064
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN NEED.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.265
IT WILL INCREASE BLIGHT AND

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:45.668
HOMELESSNESS.

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:47.236
UNDER STRICT FORMS OF RENT

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:49.038
CONTROL THE STUDIES DEMONSTRATE

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:51.273
THE PROPERTY OWNERS WILL CONVERT

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.374
THEIR HOUSING TO OWNERSHIP

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.709
HOUSING.

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:55.344
CONDOMINIUMS AND TENDENCIES AND

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:57.179
CARMEN.

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.247
A STUDY OUT OF STANFORD

01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:00.449
UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT SAN

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:05.287
FRANCISCO REDUCE TO SUPPLY.

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:05.888
THE MINISTER COURTESY IN THIS

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:07.322
HEARING ROOM.

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:08.557
THE SAME COURTESY THAT EACH OF

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:09.291
YOU WHO WOULD WANT TO SPEAK

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:09.925
WOULD WANT TO RECEIVE THANK YOU

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.260
VERY MUCH.

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:13.562
THANK YOU SIR.

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.763
I STUDY OUT OF STAMFORD FOUND

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.298
THAT SAN FRANCISCO REDUCED ITS

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:19.034
SUPPLY RENTAL HOUSING BY 15% AND

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:21.904
EXPERIENCED A 25% REDUCTION IN

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.372
THE NUMBER OF RENTERS LIVING IN

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:25.107
RENT CONTROL UNITS TODAY

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.775
RELATIVE TO NINETEEN NINETY FOUR

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:28.577
LEVELS.

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:30.379
AND A RECENT STUDY OUT OF UC

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:31.714
BERKELEY THE TURN REPORT

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.449
DEMONSTRATES THAT STRICT RENT

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:34.583
CONTROL.

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.251
WHICH SHOULD BECOME LEGAL UNDER

01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:38.120
THE ELIMINATION OF COSTA HAWKINS.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.888
COULD CONSTRAIN NEW HOUSING

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:40.956
SUPPLY.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.825
REDUCE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:43.826
QUALITY.

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:46.061
AND WILL LEAD TO THE REMOVAL OF

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:46.628
THE EXISTING UNITS FROM THE

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:49.131
MARKET.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.466
AND BECAUSE RATE CONTROL IS

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.000
RARELY MEANS TESTED WE KNOW THAT

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:55.404
THE BENEFITS DON'T COME TO THOSE

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:57.439
WHO TRULY NEED IT.

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:58.841
RENT CONTROL UNIT SHOULD BE

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:01.410
RESERVED FOR THOSE IN MOST NEED.

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:02.611
SO THAT WE DO NOT SEE

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:04.379
DISPLACEMENT.

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:06.448
UNFORTUNATELY THE INITIATIVE

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:07.983
DOES NOTHING TO TARGET THIS

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.519
POPULATION AND DOES NOTHING TO

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:12.254
PROTECT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:14.156
DESPERATE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:16.592
AND WHO ARE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD.

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:18.127
THE TURNER REPORT SUGGESTS A

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.394
NUMBER OF WAYS TO EXTEND

01:13:19.461 --> 01:13:21.463
MEANINGFUL PROTECTION TO RENTERS

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:24.767
WITHOUT CONSTRAINING NEW SUPPLY.

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:25.901
AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.669
REPRESENTS RENTAL PROPERTY

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:29.204
OWNERS WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:31.273
RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS GO OUT OF

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:31.974
THE BUSINESS.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.710
BUT WHEN READ CONTROL BECOMES

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.378
TOO EXTREME.

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:37.980
WE WILL DEFEND THEIR RIGHT TO DO

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.548
SO.

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:41.183
IF THIS INITIATIVE PASSES

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.051
ESPECIALLY FOR SINGLE FAMILY

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:44.853
HOMES AND SMALLER BUILDINGS.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.722
SMALL OWNERS WHO REPRESENTED

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:48.257
MODE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSING IN

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:51.260
CALIFORNIA WILL CONVERT FOR WILL

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:52.895
SELL THEIR HOMES OCCUPANTS OR

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.329
UNFORTUNATELY TO AIRBNB

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:55.798
SITUATIONS.

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:58.100
WE'VE SEEN THIS IN STRICT RENT

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.601
CONTROLLED A SITUATIONS.

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.436
THERE ARE WEBSITES DEVOTED TO

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.172
THIS AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:04.339
NUMBER OF STATE BILLS THAT

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:06.475
ATTEMPTED UNSUCCESSFULLY STOP

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.076
OWNERS FROM LEAVING THE MARKET.

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.578
THERE'S NO DOUBT WE ARE GOING TO

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:11.513
SEE MORE OF THIS [inaudible]

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.182
WE AGREE.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.350
CALIFORNIA'S HIGH COST OF LIVING

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.852
HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT IN SOME

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.387
PARTS OF THE STATE FOR EMPLOYERS

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:19.621
TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN SKILLED

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:21.523
WORKERS.

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.258
THIS ALL CENTERS AROUND THE FACT

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:24.526
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:26.228
HOUSING.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.964
NOT BECAUSE OF COSTA HAWKINS.

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:30.899
WE'VE ALL SEEN NEWS REPORTS THAT

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:32.434
TELL US THAT SOARING HOUSING

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.469
COSTS HAVE LED TO THOUSANDS OF

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.638
PEOPLE LEAVING THE CALIFORNIA.

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:38.073
THIS WILL CONTINUE EVEN IF THE

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.042
INITIATIVE PASSES AND WHILE

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:41.743
EXISTING TENANTS MAY EXPERIENCE

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.512
LOWER RENTS.

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.247
IT WILL BE HARDER TO FIND A

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.182
VACANT UNIT FOR NEW EMPLOYEES

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:48.984
AND STUDENTS.

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:51.186
THE INITIATIVE DOES NOT ADDRESS

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:53.155
OUR HOUSING PROBLEM IT POURS

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.157
GASOLINE ON A HOUSING CRISIS AND

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.726
WE BELIEVE MAKES IT WORSE.

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:59.962
FINALLY THE PROPONENTS CITE THAT.

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:01.530
THAT STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT RENT

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:03.398
CONTROL COMMUNITIES.

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.033
A CONSTRUCTION HAS CONTINUED I

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.035
HAVE TO REINFORCE THE FACT THAT

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:09.037
NEW CONSTRUCTION HAS CONTINUED

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.505
BECAUSE COSTA HAWKINS HAS

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:12.941
ENSURED THAT THOSE DEVELOPERS

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.143
WILL RECEIVE IN BE EXEMPT FROM

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:16.912
RENT CONTROL.

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:18.580
THE INITIATIVE DOES NOT PROVIDE

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.716
THOSE ASSURANCES.

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.551
ON THE FRONT OF LITIGATION.

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:23.952
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS IN

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:24.553
WHICH THIS INITIATIVE WILL

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.154
INCREASE LITIGATION AND COST TO

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:27.723
THE STATE.

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:29.925
SECTION TEN OF THE INITIATIVE

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:31.760
PROVIDES THAT IF THE STATE OR

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:33.629
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FAILED

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.864
TO TO A TO DEFEND THE INITIATIVE.

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:37.866
PROPONENTS ARE AUTHORIZED TO

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:40.369
INTERVENE IN ANY COURT ACTION

01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:42.070
CHALLENGING BUT ACT'S

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:43.906
CONSTITUTIONALITY.

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:45.274
THE PROPONENTS ATTORNEY'S FEES

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.809
MUST BE SATISFIED PROMPTLY OUT

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:49.945
OF THE FUNDS.

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.847
A APPROPRIATED TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:53.882
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.784
THIS PROVISION WILL ADD

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:58.186
LITIGATION COSTS IMPOSED BY THE

01:15:58.253 --> 01:15:59.788
INITIATIVE OR STATE GOVERNMENT

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:01.823
BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE PROVIDES

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.292
THAT THE STATE MUST PAY THEIR

01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:06.862
COST WHETHER THEY WIN OR LOSE.

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:08.430
THIS WAR KICK RECREATE A COTTAGE

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:10.899
INDUSTRY FOR TRIAL LAWYERS TO

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:12.734
LITIGATE EVEN IF THE LOCAL

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:16.338
JURISDICTION HAS DECIDED. TO AND

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.573
LITIGATION AND TO SETTLE.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.275
AND WHILE THIS INITIATIVE DOES

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:22.077
ALLOW FOR A FAIR RETURN ON

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:25.180
INVESTMENT IT FAILS TO DEFINE IT.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:27.749
BEFORE COSTA HAWKINS CAME INTO

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:29.818
EFFECT THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:31.787
LAWSUITS ON THIS TOPIC.

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:33.455
AFTER COSTA HAWKINS CAME INTO

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:34.856
EFFECT THE LAWSUITS WERE ALL BUT

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.391
ELIMINATED.

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.560
BECAUSE IT GAVE TO LANDLORDS

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:40.629
VACANCY DE CONTROL.

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.097
THE LOW RANCID OWNERS WERE

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:44.299
REQUIRED AYE TO CHARGE UNDER

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:45.968
SOME EXTREME FORMS OF RENT

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:47.736
CONTROL.

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:49.738
ALSO GAVE THE THEM THE ABILITY

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:51.673
TO INCREASE THEIR RENTS WHEN

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.575
THERE WAS A TURNOVER INTENDANCY.

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:56.378
WE WILL SEE LITIGATION CONTINUE

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.913
AND PROBABLY INCREASED

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.582
DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THIS.

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:02.317
INITIATIVE AND OR STRICT FORMS

PROMISED TO US.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.322
BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOW FINALLY

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:08.657
THIS MEASURE PREVENTS THE

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:11.059
LEGISLATURE FROM ADDRESSING ANY

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.060

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:13.962
INITIATIVE.

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:15.063
THE LANGUAGE PROVIDES THE

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:17.466
LEGISLATURE MAY ONLY AMEND THIS

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:19.067
ACT TO FURTHER THE PURPOSES OF

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.871
IN EACH HOUSE TWO THIRDS OF THE

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.806

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:25.907
PASS THAT IN THE GOVERNOR MUST

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:28.543
SIGN IT NO STATUTE RESTRICTING

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:30.078

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:38.353
AFFECTS UNLESS ITS EFFECT IT'S

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.888

IF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:50.732
COME TO FRUITION.

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.167
YOU CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.636

PROJECTS OUT OF THE GROUND.

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.165

TO EXTREME RENT CONTROL WOULD

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:45.553
HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.788
MOST NOTABLY IT WOULD

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:47.889
DRASTICALLY REDUCED AMOUNT OF

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:49.724

MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE SMALL MOM

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:54.162
AND POP OPERATORS.

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:55.196
WOULD BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:56.531

EXTREME RENT CONTROL.

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:01.336
AS A RESULT THE SINGLE FAMILY

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:02.670
RENTALS TO BE SOLD AND CONVERTED

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:04.472

HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS.

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:08.410
IN TERMS OF THE IMPACTS OF

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:09.844
EXTREME RENT CONTROL ON NEW

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.479
CONSTRUCTION A RECENT STUDY FROM

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:12.914
RECORDS UNIVERSITY INCLUDED A

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.749
CROSS SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF NEW

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:16.050
JERSEY METROS WITHIN WITHOUT

01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:17.018
RENT CONTROL.

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:17.819
AND FOUND THAT PER CAPITA

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:20.722
CONSTRUCTION FALLS BY ABOUT 25%

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:21.556
IN JURISDICTIONS WITH RENT

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:22.924

VARIABLES CONSTANT.

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.528
APPLYING THAT RESULT CALIFORNIA.

01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:27.562
INSTRUCTION WOULD DECREASE BY

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:29.063
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:30.698
PER YEAR AND WOULD LEAD TO A

01:24:30.765 --> 01:24:32.667
CUMULATIVE DEFICIT OF WELL OVER

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.602
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS BY.

NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF EXTREME RENT

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:38.606

01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:39.908
AT SUCH RENT CONTROL AS IT

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:41.075
EXISTED PRIOR TO THE

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:43.378
IMPLEMENTATION OF COSTA HAWKINS.

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:44.312
IN BERKELEY DURING THE NINETEEN

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:45.647
SEVENTIES EXTREME RENT CONTROL

RENTALS IN NEW CONSTRUCTION.

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:50.318
AS A RESULT BERKELEY REPORTED

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:51.419
THAT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.288
UNITS THAT WERE RENTED IN

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:54.189
NINETEEN EIGHTY WERE NOT RENTED

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.090
A DECADE LATER IN PART BECAUSE

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:56.691
TWELVE HUNDRED SINGLE FAMILY

01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:58.726

CONVERTED OWNER OCCUPANCY.

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:03.131
THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF EXTREME

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:04.766
RENT CONTROL OF NOT JUST

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:05.967
EXCLUSIVE TO CALIFORNIA.

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:06.768
THE CITY OF CAMBRIDG

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:08.503
MASSACHUSETTS FOUND THAT EXTREME

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:09.237
RENT CONTROL IN THE NINETEEN

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:11.105
SEVENTIES RESULTED IN ROUGHLY

10% OF THE CITY'S RENT CONTROL

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.641
HOUSING STOCK.

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:14.542
BEING CONVERTED TO NON

01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:16.578
CONTROLLED CONDOMINIUMS.

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:17.445
IN RESPONSE TO THIS AND OTHER

01:25:17.512 --> 01:25:18.780
FINDINGS CAMBRIDGE EVENTUALLY

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:20.715

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:22.750
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR GIVEN ALL

01:25:22.817 --> 01:25:24.185
THIS EXTREME RENT CONTROL WHICH

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:25.320
WOULD RETURN TO CALIFORNIA THIS

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:26.988
INITIATIVE PASSES.

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:28.323
CLEARLY NOT THE SOLUTION THE

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:28.923
STATE'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.291
CRISIS.

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:31.259
RATHER THE SOLUTION IS MORE

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:32.827
SUPPLY.

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:33.962
THERE'S SIMPLY NO GETTING AROUND

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:35.497
IT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:36.698
SUFFER FROM A STAGGERING AND

01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:38.666
CHRONIC HOUSING SUPPLY SHORTAGE.

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:40.134
THE STATE IS NOT SIMPLY BUILDING

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:40.635
ENOUGH HOUSING UNITS FOR

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:42.136
EVERYONE.

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.438
THE LACK OF ADEQUATE SUPPLY HAS

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:45.240
LED TO SKYROCKETING PRICES.

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:46.407
CLEARLY SUBSTANTIALLY MORE

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:48.510
HOUSING NEEDS TO BE BUILT.

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:49.310
HERE'S SOME TROUBLING FACTS FOR

01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:51.679
YOUR CONSIDERATION. THREE POINT

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:53.181
FOUR MILLION ADDITIONAL HOUSING

UNITS ARE NEEDED BY.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:55.783
TWENTY THIRTY ABOUT HALF THE

DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:02.457
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SAYS THAT

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:04.225
THE STATE MUST BUILD HUNDRED

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:05.260
EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS EACH YEAR

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.127
TO KEEP PACE WITH POPULATION

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:06.794
GROWTH.

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:07.762
THE STATE IS CURRENTLY ONLY

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:10.198
BUILDING HALF THAT. THREE THE

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:11.633
STATE'S MEDIAN HOME PRICE IN MAY

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.568
OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF

600-100-0800 SIXTY DOLLARS IS

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:15.870
MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NATION'S

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:17.372
MEDIAN PRICE.

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:19.507
AVERAGE HOME RENTALS ARE 50%

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:20.074
HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:21.309
COUNTRY.

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:22.510
AND LASTLY THE STATE'S

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.212
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE OF FIFTY FIVE

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.847
POINT 1% IS THE SECOND LOWEST

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.949
AMONG ALL STATES IN THE U. S..

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.517
CA ARE PROPOSES THAT THE

01:26:29.584 --> 01:26:30.051
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THE

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.352
FOLLOWING TO HELP INCREASE THE

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:34.088
STATE'S HOUSING SUPPLY. ONE

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:34.622
STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING

FASTRACK AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:41.095
THREE REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

IMPLEMENT HOUSING NEEDS NUMBERS.

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:45.300
FOR FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:47.235
AND LASTLY DEFEAT PROPOSED

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:48.169
LEGISLATION THAT DISCOURAGES

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:50.438
RENTAL HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:51.973
IN CONCLUSION WELL THIS

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:52.840
INITIATIVE WOULD REPEAL THE

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:53.942

HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:07.628
ABOUT 50% OF WHITE.

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:08.830
IT'S MOST ASTOUNDING THOUGH IS A

GREATER THAN MINORITY WELL FUNDS.

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:18.105
AND LOT OF THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:20.608
THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IN IN.

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:22.977

THIS INITIATIVE IS WELL INTENDED

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:26.814

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:28.649
IS A WORLDLY.

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:30.685

OF INVESTORS AND LANDLORDS AND

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:36.524
THIS FEAR WILL INHIBIT THEM FROM

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.459
MAINTAINING THEIR PROPERTIES AND

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.494
CREATING NEW PROPERTIES TO ADD

01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:42.496

THE HOUSING CRISIS THERE'S A

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:49.403

01:32:10.491 --> 01:32:12.526
DOES NOT PROMOTE THAT.

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:14.362
IT CREATES A DEMOCRATIZATION IF

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.709
TO THE MINORITY COMMUNITY.

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:30.745

HOUSING ELEMENT LAWS THEY WERE

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.681

SO FAR BEHIND IN IN HOUSING.

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:37.685
WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.954
