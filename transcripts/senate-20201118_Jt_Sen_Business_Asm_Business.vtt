00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:44.556
SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD LOOKS

00:23:44.623 --> 00:23:46.224
AT TO BE SURE THAT- READ OF

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:47.425
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ISN'T

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:48.960
BECAUSE OF EITHER EXCESSIVE

00:23:49.027 --> 00:23:51.463
WORKLOAD OR- EXCESSIVE

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.031
SUPERVISION RESPONSIBILITIES

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.833
THAT LEAD TO POTENTIAL EITHER

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.936
ERRORS OR- ARE HARMED ITS CARS

00:23:58.003 --> 00:24:00.238
SO IS THAT SOMETHING THE BOARD

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:02.808
LOOKED AT. THE BOARD ITSELF HAS

00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:05.177
NOT CONDUCTED ANY OF THOSE-

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:07.612
TYPES OF STUDIES THERE ARE SOME

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.481
OUT THERE- BUT NOT SPECIFIC TO

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:12.217
CALIFORNIA BUT I AM AWARE. OF

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:13.685
SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO

00:24:13.752 --> 00:24:15.821
ALSO SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE

00:24:15.887 --> 00:24:17.556
REGARDING MEDICATION ERRORS.

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:18.924
AND THAT THE BOARD HAS NOT HAD

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.060
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW- THAT

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:23.395
THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND ISSUES

00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:25.697
BUT- I BELIEVE THAT THAT MAY BE

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:27.365
ONE AREA THAT ALSO BLEEDS OVER

00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:30.602
INTO MEDICATION ERRORS AND- I

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:32.337
WOULD EXPECT THAT THE BOARD

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:33.972
WILL CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT IT

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:35.740
SHOULD BE- CONDUCTING A STUDY.

00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:37.342
OR WORKING WITH PERHAPS SOME OF

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:39.077
THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.612
WITHIN CALIFORNIA TO CONDUCT

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.681
THOSE KINDS OF STUDIES OKAY I

00:24:42.747 --> 00:24:44.783
THINK THAT WOULD BE. IMPORTANT

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.084
TO YOU KNOW THE BOARD GAME

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:47.219
PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:49.554
PROTECTOR OF THE CONSUMER- IT

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:50.722
NEEDS TO BE SURE THAT THE WORK

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:51.957
ENVIRONMENT WHICH PHARMACISTS

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:53.892
ARE WORKING ALLOWS THEM TO DO

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:55.594
THEIR JOB APPROPRIATELY AND HAD

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.196
DIFFERENT DATA FIND PROBLEMS L.

00:24:58.263 --> 00:25:00.265
DOING THAT ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS.

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:02.234
AND BE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.301
WORKLOAD ISSUES THAT ARE

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:05.270
LEADING TO ISSUE PROBLEMS WE

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:06.171
ARE ASKING MORE OF OUR

00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:08.940
PHARMACISTS- AND- THERE ON THE

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:10.008
FRONT LINES AND THEY'RE VERY

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.476
THEY'RE VALUED MEMBERS OF THE

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:13.245
HEALTHCARE TEAM WHO DO VERY

00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:13.778
IMPORTANT THINGS AND WE'RE

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.180
GOING TO HAVE THEM. GIVE

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:16.381
COVETED IMMUNIZATIONS HOPEFULLY

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:17.849
AS A WAY TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:19.384
THAT AS WELL AS OTHER. TYPES OF

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:21.052
VERY IMPORTANT SERVICES AND-

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:23.488
ALSO. I THINK THERE'S BEEN A

00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:24.723
DESIRE TO HAVE THEM DO MORE

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:25.891
POTENTIALLY SCREENINGS OR OTHER

00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:27.192
TYPES OF THINGS MEDICATION

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:29.327
MANAGEMENT. AND BUT THOSE ALSO

00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:30.195
COME WITH GREATER

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:32.030
RESPONSIBILITIES AND GREATER

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:33.965
TIME AND SO WE NEED TO BE SURE

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.901
THAT. AS WE'RE ROLLING THESE

00:25:35.967 --> 00:25:37.936
OUT THE BOARD IN THIS ROLE IS

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:39.771
TO PUT NO CONSUMER PROTECTION-

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:45.410
THAT IF IT. TO IDENTIFY ITS-

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:46.411

THE SEA THERE'S PROBLEMS BUT-

00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:58.823

COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED-

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:18.403
IT'S ALSO IN PART THE TYPES OF

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:19.904
INVESTIGATIONS THAT WERE DOING

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:22.374
THAT SOMETIMES ARE VERY COMPLEX

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.542
ELKS IN IF YOU LOOK AT OUR

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.311
INVESTIGATION CASE TIMES

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:27.312
THEY'RE ALSO A LITTLE BIT

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:30.081
LONGER THAN WE WOULD- LIKE. AND

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:31.716
IN PART IT'S BECAUSE OF THE

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:32.517
COMPLEXITY OF THE TYPES OF

00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:35.053
CASES. THE BOARD HAS WORKED

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.022
REALLY HARD TO FOCUS ON

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:41.860
EDUCATION- IN ADDITION TO

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:43.395
ENFORCEMENT AND- HOW PART OF IT

00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:45.597
COULD BE THE RESULT OF THE

00:27:45.663 --> 00:27:47.265
BOARD'S EDUCATION EFFORTS WE

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.701

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:51.202

SYSTEM AND OUR NEWSLETTER. SO I

00:28:11.456 --> 00:28:14.492

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:37.468
ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ON THAT OR

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:40.738
IS THERE STUDIES BEING DONE BY

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:42.807
THE BOARD IN THIS IN THIS ISSUE.

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:45.443
I SO THE BOARD DOES NOT. EXCUSE

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.280
ME DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION- I

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:52.450
WOULD SAY THAT IT'S A WIN- TO.

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.285
HE BACK IN ON SOME OF WHAT AND

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:56.020
DOCTOR PANTS FACT ABOUT AS

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:59.090
PHARMACIST ARE GIVEN ADDITIONAL-

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:00.625
YOU KNOW AUTHORITIES THERE'S A

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.227
BALANCING ACT THAT NEEDS TO

00:31:02.293 --> 00:31:04.963
OCCUR TO ENSURE THAT- HAITIANS

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:06.698
ARE STILL RECEIVING ALL OF THE

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:09.567
NECESSARY CARE. AND WORKLOAD IS

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:11.869
IF HE SAID THAT AS A MEDICATION

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:12.670
THERE'S A LOTS OF OTHER THINGS

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:14.138
SO I THINK THAT ITSELF IT'S A

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:16.741
HOLISTIC COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:19.277
NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED- THERE'S

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:20.678
BEEN YOU KNOW DISCUSSIONS IN

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:22.013
THE MEDIA ABOUT MEDICATION

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.182
ERRORS. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:26.017
THE POTENTIAL WITH THE RATIONS

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:28.453
AND WHAT THOSE LOOK LIKE- IT

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.388
NEEDS TO BE BELIEVE THE BOARD

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:32.023
WILL BE. LOOKING AT THE ISSUE

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.925
IN A VERY DELIBERATE IN FASHION

00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:35.860
TO SEE IF AN INCREASE IN THE

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:42.867
RATIO WOULD ACTUALLY- AT

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:44.002
ADDRESS WHAT COULD BE. BE

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:45.937
WORKFORCE CHALLENGES FOR

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:48.139
FURTHER- JUST WORK THE PHARMACY

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.707

THAT TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:07.258
DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:08.760

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:10.395

TO DO THEIR BEST WORK. AND

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:25.109
SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:27.512
HAVING THE- CHIEF PHARMACISTS

KOBE CASES WE ARE AT IT IS

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.629
SERIOUS AB. THE POINT OF

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:20.498
CONCERN IN REGARD TO INFECTIONS

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:25.069
GOING UP. DRAMATICALLY NOW. AS

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:26.704
THEY DID IN THE SUMMER- BUT WE

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:27.505
HAVEN'T ARE OUR OUR MEDICAL

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:28.973
SYSTEMS HAVE NOT BEEN OVER RUN

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.174
AS THEY HAD BEEN IN OTHER

00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:32.343
STATES. HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.278

PHARMACY SERVICES AND SOME OF

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:36.781
THESE STATES THAT HAVE

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.850
EXPERIENCED THAT. EXTREME

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:40.752
IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN TO

00:33:40.818 --> 00:33:42.553
UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF LESSONS

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.855
WE CAN LEARN FROM THEIR

00:33:43.921 --> 00:33:46.557
EXPERIENCES SO THAT. IF THINGS

00:33:46.624 --> 00:33:49.026
WERE TO GET WORSE HERE THAT. WE

00:33:49.093 --> 00:33:49.660
WOULD BE PREPARED AS WE COULD

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:52.163
BE FROM- THE- OUR HEALTH

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.632

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:11.783
EIGHTY I WAS UNABLE TO MEET

STILL AS PART OF OUR COMPANY WE

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:16.888
HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:18.823

PHARMACY- I'M THE LEADING END

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:31.836
OF MANY OF THE RESPONSES AND- I

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:34.672
BELIEVE THAT IN MANY CASES THE

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:36.174
APPROACH THAT WE ARE TAKING HAS

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.176
BEEN LEVERAGED BY OTHER

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:41.512

THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:45.550
DELIVERY OF PHARMACEUTICAL

00:34:45.616 --> 00:34:47.685
SERVICES IN IN YORK IN NEW

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:49.287
JERSEY AND OTHER PLACES WHERE

00:34:49.353 --> 00:34:54.325
THERE HAVE HAD SERIOUS- RUN OF

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:56.828
COVE IN NINETEEN-

00:34:56.894 --> 00:34:59.263
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND THE LIKE.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.965
STILL CALIFORNIA WE STILL HAVE

00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:04.268
THE CHALLENGES WITH THAT PP- SO

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:06.204
WE DO HAVE WAIVERS IN EFFECT

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.940
THERE IN MANY STATES ACROSS THE

00:35:09.006 --> 00:35:11.242
NATION HALF THOSE- EARLY ON

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:12.610
WHEN THERE IS- A LOT OF

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:13.611
CHALLENGES WITH DIRECT

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:15.913
SHORTAGES IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.281
ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO THE

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:19.016
OUTSOURCING FACILITIES- THAT

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.885
ARE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:22.820
WE DEVELOPED A LIST OF PRODUCTS

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:25.623
THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO MAKE IT-

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.325
SO THAT HOSPITALS ESPECIALLY

00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:30.027
THAT WE'RE NEEDING- MEDICATIONS

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.028
TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS WOULD

00:35:31.095 --> 00:35:32.763
HAVE ACCESS TO THEM. IT'S

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.399
ALWAYS A BALANCING ACT- BUT WE

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.034
WERE VERY PROACTIVE IN DOING

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:38.269
THAT AND ENSURING THAT THERE

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:40.805
WAS RESOURCES AVAILABLE- SO

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:42.306
THAT HOSPITALS ESPECIALLY WOULD

00:35:42.373 --> 00:35:43.941
BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE TO GO

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:47.845
WITH RESPECT TO DISTRACTIONS

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:50.448
IN- AT PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION.

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:51.883
EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC THERE

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:53.951
WERE CONCERNS ABOUT-

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:55.219
HYDROCHLORIC NGUYEN AND

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.688
ATTENTIONAL SHORTAGES THERE. ON

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.056
THE BOARD WORKED WITH BOTH THE

00:35:59.123 --> 00:36:00.224
MEDICAL BOARD AND THE

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:08.332
DISPENSERS ABOUT THE STANDARD

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:09.834
OF CARE IN TO BE FOLLOWING THE

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:11.068
APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF CARE.

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:11.936
AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.471
OBLIGATIONS THERE ARE SOME

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:15.106
STATES THAT TOOK ACTIONS TO

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:19.911
ACTUALLY- RESTRICT- MEDICATION

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:21.279
DISPENSING IN CERTAIN AREAS

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:24.482
THAT IS NOT BE APPROACH THAT

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:25.082
WAS TAKEN IN CALIFORNIA. DID

00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:26.117
YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE OUR

DEALING WITH- AN ESCALATION OF.

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:44.302
PHARMACIST HAD JUST

RESILIENCY- THROUGH THIS ENTIRE

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:51.809
AND PANDEMICS AND I THINK THAT-

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:53.778
WE HAVE VERY GOOD DIALOGUE WITH

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.713
OUR STAKEHOLDERS. AND IF THERE

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.715

DURING BOARD MEETINGS WE ALSO

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:04.555
HAVE OUR WAIVER PROCESS ONLINE

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:06.691
SHOULD A NEED COME UP THAT HAS

NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN IDENTIFIED.

00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:09.927

AGREEMENT AND WILL BE EDUCATING

01:42:09.756 --> 01:42:11.024
THEM OR BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:11.959
THE RESPONSIBILITIES BUT FOR

01:42:12.025 --> 01:42:14.027
EXAMPLE. IF THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:16.230
RISING TRAINEES AND DETAINEES

01:42:16.296 --> 01:42:18.532
ARE SEEN PATIENTS. DO YOU HAVE

01:42:18.599 --> 01:42:20.634
A WAY OF BEING ABLE TO ONE LINK

01:42:20.701 --> 01:42:22.636
BACK- SAY TRAINEES ALL THE

01:42:22.703 --> 01:42:24.137
PATIENT THAT THE SUPERVISOR

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:26.039
DOES NEED TO SIGN OFF THAT THEY

01:42:26.106 --> 01:42:27.140
WERE INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:30.410
THE PATIENT IS A SUPERVISOR SO

01:42:30.477 --> 01:42:31.211
THAT IF THERE IS A- EVENT THAT

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:33.247
HAPPENED OR- THE QUALITY WASN'T

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:34.414
THERE. ON THE TRAIN HE AND TO

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:35.616
THE TRAINEE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE

01:42:35.682 --> 01:42:37.684
THAT'S TIED TO THAT. AND THEN

01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:42.155
IN ADDITION TO THAT- SO I GUESS

01:42:42.222 --> 01:42:44.124
THAT FIGURED OUT LEVEL KIND OF

01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:44.725
DOING THE OTHER THING TO KEEP

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:46.260
IN MIND IS THAT. THERE COULD BE

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:48.362
AGREEMENTS THAT CHENEY IS NOT

01:42:48.428 --> 01:42:49.930
IN A POSITION TO CRITIQUE A

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:52.666
SUPERVISOR RIGHT. SO AND TO

01:42:52.733 --> 01:42:53.834
EXPECT THE TRAINEE TO BRING UP

01:42:53.901 --> 01:42:54.668
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE

01:42:54.735 --> 01:42:56.503
SUPERVISION I THINK IS-

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:58.038
PROBABLY NOT A VERY GOOD WAY OF

01:42:58.105 --> 01:43:00.173
DOING THINGS IT'S- SO. THAT IS

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.142
GONNA BE IN THE INCUMBENT ON

01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:03.644

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUPERVISORS

01:43:09.783 --> 01:43:11.018
SURE THAT THE SUPERVISOR IS

01:43:11.084 --> 01:43:13.053
DOING THEIR JOB. SO IT'S GREAT

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:13.554
FOR THE SUPERVISOR SELF

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:14.855

01:53:40.713 --> 01:53:43.416
KNOW A VIOLATION RATE OF 27%

01:53:43.483 --> 01:53:45.118
AND IT'S WE ARE MOST CUT WHEN

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:46.519
YOU'RE MOST COMMON CAUSES FOR

01:53:46.586 --> 01:53:49.722
CITATION. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO

01:53:49.789 --> 01:53:50.256
WHAT THE BOARD IS DOING TO

01:53:50.323 --> 01:53:52.225
ADDRESS THAT- DEFINITELY AND I

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:53.960
THINK I DON'T HAVE THE ACTUAL

01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:55.795
PERCENTAGES BUT I THINK ONE. IN

01:53:55.862 --> 01:53:57.363
THE PAST WE WERE DOING ABOUT

01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:59.666
ONLY A ONE PERCENT- I'VE BEEN

01:53:59.732 --> 01:54:02.202
LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS HERE FOR

01:54:02.268 --> 01:54:02.802
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:54:02.869 --> 01:54:03.770
WE GET FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SIX.

01:54:03.836 --> 01:54:08.408
THEY HAVE LIKE A ONE PERCENT- A

01:54:08.474 --> 01:54:12.111
SAMPLE OR AUDIT- SO REALLY WITH

01:54:12.178 --> 01:54:15.582
THE FAILURE RATE- WHAT WE'RE-

01:54:15.648 --> 01:54:19.018
IT'S MOSTLY. LICENSEES NOT

01:54:19.085 --> 01:54:21.521
UNDERSTANDING FULLY- WHAT ARE

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:24.090
THE REQUIRED- C. UNITS THAT

01:54:24.157 --> 01:54:25.558
THEY HAVE TO GET THEY MAY KNOW

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:27.026
THAT THEY HAVE THIRTY SIX UNITS

01:54:27.093 --> 01:54:28.995
THAT THEY HAVE TO GET BUT THEY

01:54:29.062 --> 01:54:31.030
FORGET SOMETIMES THAT THERE'S A

01:54:31.097 --> 01:54:32.565
SIX HOUR OF LAWN ETHICS THAT

01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:33.800
THEY HAVE TO DO EVERY RENEWAL

01:54:33.866 --> 01:54:35.602
CYCLE AND THERE'S OTHER

01:54:35.668 --> 01:54:37.737
ADDITIONAL- YOU KNOW REQUIRED

01:54:37.804 --> 01:54:40.206
COURSES FOR THAT FIRST YOU KNOW

01:54:40.273 --> 01:54:43.076
IT SO THAT'S WERE SEEN I THINK.

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:44.510
MOST OF THE- IN THE FAILURE

01:54:44.577 --> 01:54:45.845
RATES ARE IN THE HOUSE IT'S

01:54:45.912 --> 01:54:47.914
NOT. COMPLETELY MISSING THIRTY

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:49.482
SIX HOURS THE OTHER THING THAT

01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:51.117
WE'RE EXPERIENCING INSTANCE WE

01:54:51.184 --> 01:54:54.287
DID GO TO. A WHILE BACK ABOUT

01:54:54.354 --> 01:54:55.421
THREE YEARS AGO I THINK IT WAS

01:54:55.488 --> 01:54:57.257
WE CHANGED OUR C. E. REQUIRE AS

01:54:57.323 --> 01:55:01.294
C. E. APPROVAL AGENCIES- THIRTY

01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:02.428
EIGHT SOME OF THE SCENES THAT

01:55:02.495 --> 01:55:04.163
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING DO

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:06.899
NOT QUALIFY. FOR OUR CURRENT

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:08.301
REQUIREMENTS SO THAT'S WHAT

01:55:08.368 --> 01:55:09.969
WE'RE SEEING WHAT WE ARE DOING

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:12.171
NOW I THINK WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO

01:55:12.238 --> 01:55:12.739
DO IS DEFINITELY MORE

01:55:12.805 --> 01:55:15.708
EDUCATION. MORE NOTICES TO OUR

01:55:15.775 --> 01:55:17.477
LICENSEES ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO

01:55:17.543 --> 01:55:19.379
BE DONE WITH SEEDS. AND WEBER

01:55:19.445 --> 01:55:21.814
THESE ARE REQUIRED. AND THEN

01:55:21.881 --> 01:55:23.416
FOR THE AUDIT PURPOSES WE'VE

01:55:23.483 --> 01:55:25.251
ACTUALLY GONE AHEAD AND WE ARE.

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:27.520
THIS YEAR- WE HAVE A NEW

01:55:27.587 --> 01:55:29.155
POSITION THAT IS BASICALLY

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:35.395
GOING TO BE. REALLY.

01:55:35.461 --> 01:55:36.663
CONCENTRATING ON JUST THE- IN

01:55:36.729 --> 01:55:37.530
THE- PROCESS WE WILL BE IN THE

01:55:37.597 --> 01:55:40.133
YEAR. OUR AUDIENCE WILL ACT- BE

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:41.768
INCREASING ON THAT SO I'M

01:55:41.834 --> 01:55:43.703
THINKING HOPEFULLY WITH.

01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:46.005
FACTORY I MEANING. STAFF MEMBER

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:48.708
BEING ABLE TO YOU THAT AUDIT.

01:55:48.775 --> 01:55:52.011
LAST- BUT IT'S MORE. TO WILL

01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:54.881
SEEM. WHAT WE SEE YOU KNOW

01:55:54.947 --> 01:56:00.019
PERCENT FAILURE RATE THE EX

01:56:00.086 --> 01:56:03.423
OKAY SO I MEAN. IF YOU. ANY

01:56:03.489 --> 01:56:04.457
ABERRATION THAT ANSWER THAT

01:56:04.524 --> 01:56:05.892
YOU'RE INVESTING AND DOING THIS

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:08.261
IT'S ONLY- DOING 1% AND OF THAT

01:56:08.328 --> 01:56:11.130
1% OF THE 27% FAILURE RATE. AND

01:56:11.197 --> 01:56:12.432
AGAIN FOR THE REASONS USED TO

01:56:12.498 --> 01:56:13.800
IT I MEAN THAT SOURCE THAT'S

01:56:13.866 --> 01:56:15.768
REPRESENTS SAMPLE OF THE ENTIRE

01:56:15.835 --> 01:56:19.205
SO- I THINK OF PERHAPS RATHER

01:56:19.272 --> 01:56:21.474
BE EXAMINATION OF. WHETHER TO

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:23.242
SEE REQUIREMENTS PEOPLE ARE

01:56:23.309 --> 01:56:24.877
UNDERSTANDING IT THIS LACK OF

01:56:24.944 --> 01:56:26.746
CLARITY THERE TOO COMPLEX AND

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:27.613
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT BE SOME

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:29.449
SIMPLIFICATION ADULT LEARNING

01:56:29.515 --> 01:56:31.617
IS PEOPLE USUALLY. IDENTIFYING

01:56:31.684 --> 01:56:33.953
THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES- SO I

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:35.254
DON'T KNOW HOW COMPLEX YOUR C.

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:36.656
REQUIREMENTS ARE BEYOND THE

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:38.157
NUMBER OF HOURS I THINK THERE'S

01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:40.126
A BALANCE BETWEEN. HOW MANY

01:56:40.193 --> 01:56:41.427
RESTRICTIONS YOU PUT ON IT LIKE

01:56:41.494 --> 01:56:43.596
WHAT TYPES VERSES TOTAL NUMBER

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:45.398
OF HOURS AND 2 DEGREES THAT-

01:56:45.465 --> 01:56:47.400
BUT- IS THAT I THINK THAT

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:48.668
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO

01:56:48.735 --> 01:56:49.969
BE FOLLOWED UP BECAUSE

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:51.371
OTHERWISE EFFECTIVELY WHATEVER

01:56:51.437 --> 01:56:53.172
SEE POLICY YOU HAVE IS NOT.

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:54.774
BEING CARRIED OUT SO YOU MAKE A

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:56.175
GOOD TENSIONS REQUIRE PEOPLE TO

01:56:56.242 --> 01:56:57.510
DO A CERTAIN TYPE OF C. BUT

01:56:57.577 --> 01:56:58.578
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE NOT DOING

01:56:58.644 --> 01:57:00.780
IT. AND SO THAT'S DID SOMEWHERE

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.048
WE GOTTA FIND IN A AND A

01:57:02.115 --> 01:57:04.150
BALANCED THERE THE OTHER ISSUE

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:06.586
ALSO IS THAT AND I APPRECIATE

01:57:06.652 --> 01:57:08.221
THAT THE BOARD- NO LONGER

01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:09.989
ACTUALLY PROVES- SPECIFIC C. E.

01:57:10.056 --> 01:57:12.558
BUT THEN- GOES THROUGH- THESE

01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:14.894
VARIOUS. ORGANIZATIONS WHICH-

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:16.596
CERTAINLY SEEMS APPROPRIATE BUT

01:57:16.662 --> 01:57:20.800
I DID- I DO NEED TO ASK IS. IS

01:57:20.867 --> 01:57:23.603
THERE A BOARD POLICY- IN

01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:26.005
REGARDS TO CONTENT BE SURE THAT

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:28.875
WHATEVER SEE PEOPLE TAKE- THAT

01:57:28.941 --> 01:57:29.475
THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:31.210
POLICY THAT- WELL I MEAN IS

01:57:31.277 --> 01:57:32.044
THAT THERE'S NOT UNDUE

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:33.413

ORGANIZATION MAY HAVE THEIR OWN

01:57:37.817 --> 01:57:38.818
STANDARDS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE

PLACE TO ENSURE THAT. THE C. E.

01:57:46.793 --> 01:57:49.195
