00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:35.192
VENDOR TO HELP WITH THE STUDY

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:38.429
THAT WOULD BE PROCURED IN JULY.

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:40.498
AND THEN BY SEPTEMBER- THE

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.066
DEPARTMENT WOULD BEGIN THE

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:43.367
PROCESS OF PREPARING  BUDGET

00:36:43.434 --> 00:36:45.670
PROPOSAL. I WOULD NOTE THAT

00:36:45.736 --> 00:36:46.871
OTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:48.706
PROPOSAL ARE UNKNOWN FOR

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:50.675
EXAMPLE WHAT THE PROCESS WOULD

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:52.643
BE FOR CONDUCTING THE STUDY

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.278
WHAT THE DELIVERABLES WOULD BE

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:58.616
ASIDE FROM THE ULTIMATE- BUDGET

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.151
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD WOULD BE

00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:02.353
PRESENTED IN JANUARY. AND WE'RE

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.788
NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW WHAT THE

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:05.823
EXPENDITURES OF THE THREE

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.924
MILLION DOLLARS WOULD ACTUALLY

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.392
BE FOR ASIDE FROM THE

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:09.927
POSSIBILITY OF HIRING OF A

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:12.697
VENDOR OR OR COMP OUTSIDE

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.298
CONTRACTOR. NO WE WOULD NOTE

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:16.634
THAT THE TIMING AND THE

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:18.502
RESPONSE COMPONENT THE RESPONSE

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.137
REVIEW COMPONENT OF THE STUDY

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:22.974
UP HERE CAN TO WHAT'S CALLED AN

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.042
AFTER ACTION REVIEW. I'M AFTER

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:26.811
ACTION REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED

00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:28.879
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A PUBLIC

00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:30.848
HEALTH INVENTOR OTHER TYPE OF

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:33.618
EMERGENCY- FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:34.418
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:36.988
SECURITY- CONDUCTED THEIR AFTER

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:38.389
ACTION REVIEW OF HURRICANE

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:40.725
KATRINA JUST FIVE MONTHS AFTER

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:43.561
THE HURRICANE STARTED. AND IT'S

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:44.929
REALLY HELPED TO MEN YEAH IT'S

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.931
REALLY MEANT TO HELP KEEP

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:48.466
PLAYERS UNDERSTAND THE ACTIONS

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:50.234
THAT WERE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:52.203
AN EMERGENCY WHAT WENT WELL

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:54.171
WHAT MAYBE DIDN'T GO SO WELL

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:57.341
WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. SO I

00:37:57.408 --> 00:38:00.945
JUST. WANT TO RAISE A FEW- A

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:03.114
FEW KEY POINTS FIRST. OUR

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.649
OFFICE RECOGNIZES THAT

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.017
CONDUCTING AN AFTER ACTION

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:07.818
REVIEW IS BOTH CRITICAL AND

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.587
IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING A

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.222
PROCESS SEES AND EMERGENCY

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:13.524
RESPONSE. BUT WE WOULD NOT THAT

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:15.059
THE SCOPE OF THIS PROPOSAL

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:17.094
APPEARS MUCH BROADER DESPITE

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:20.031
THE- THE AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE.

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.198
NOT ONLY DOES THE REVIEW

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:22.833
PROPOSED TO ASSESS THE PUBLIC

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.603
HEALTH RESPONSE TO COPE IN

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.171
NINETEEN BUT IT ALSO PROPOSES

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:29.173
TO ASSESS A COMPLEX SET OF

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.541
QUESTIONS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:31.575
INFRASTRUCTURE IN RESOURCE

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.344
NEEDS AND THEN THE THIRD

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:35.579
ASPECT- LOOKING AT THAT THE

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.148
ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES THAT

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:41.052
WERE EXACERBATED BY COPE WITH

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:42.153
NINETEEN. I NEXT WE POINT OUT

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.387
THAT THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:44.689
SOME DUPLICATION WITH ANOTHER

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:46.724
STUDY THAT'S PROPOSED IN THE

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:47.725
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:50.294
AGENCY. THE AGENCY IS PROPOSING

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:52.997
A ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR A

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.665
RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE

00:38:54.732 --> 00:38:56.734
INTERSECTION OF COVERT NINETEEN

00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:59.003
AND DISPARITIES. NO GIVEN THE

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.371
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS THE

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:02.206
CODE NINETEEN HAD ON PEOPLE OF

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:03.741
COLOR AND LOW WAGE WORKERS IN

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:06.510
CALIFORNIA. A HEALTH EQUITY

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:08.546
LENS APPEARS TO BE ONE OF THE

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:09.547
APPROPRIATE LENSES THROUGH

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:11.348
WHICH TO CONDUCT A PANDEMIC OR

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:13.451
RESPONSE REVIEW. HOWEVER AT

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:16.520
THIS TIME IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE-

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:18.022
DPH AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:19.657
SERVICES AGENCY EFFORTS WOULD

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.025
BE COORDINATED SO AS NOT TO

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:23.127
DUPLICATE- EFFORTS WHEN LOOKING

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.596
AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.431
DISPARITIES. I'M FINALLY I'D

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:28.966
LIKE TO RAISE SOME ISSUES FOR

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:31.669
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION.

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:33.104
FIRST WE SUGGEST THAT THE

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.039
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER BREAKING

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:38.008
THIS PROPOSAL INTO TWO STUDIES

00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:40.344
THE FIRST WOULD BE AN AN AFTER

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:43.247
ACTION REVIEW A QUICKLY. I'M

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:43.781
SORRY A STUDY THAT'S DONE

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:46.317
QUICKLY- COULD LIKELY BE DONE

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.552
IN HOUSE AND COULD LIKELY BE

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:50.554
DONE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVELY

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:51.655
IT CAN REALLY HELP WITH NEAR

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:53.691
TERM DECISION MAKING CLOSING

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:56.293
IDENTIFIED GAPS IN CAPACITY

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.263
EXPERTISE OR OR PLANNING

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.865
CAPABILITIES. THE SECOND STUDY

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:02.032
WOULD THEN BE A MULTI YEAR

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:04.535
ASSESSMENT. THIS WOULD BE A

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:06.337
MORE OMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:07.772
INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCE

00:40:07.838 --> 00:40:10.274
NEEDS OF BOTH THE STATE AND

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:12.209
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:14.545
LEVEL- BUT IT COULD ALSO TAKE

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:17.014
A- TAKE A STEP BACK AND EVEN

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:17.982
LOOK AT THE ROLE OF PUBLIC

00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:19.650
HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:25.022
AS- GOVERNANCE. STRUCTURES.

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:28.859
FINALLY WE SUGGESTED THAT- THE

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:30.261
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER BRIDGE

00:40:30.327 --> 00:40:32.897
FUNDING TO BOTH THE DEPARTMENT

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:34.198
OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:35.432
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHILE

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:37.401
BOTH OF THESE STUDIES ARE UNDER

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:39.670
WAY THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.872
CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A RESERVE

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:43.507
FOR FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.309
INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. DEREK

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:46.710
HAS REALLY HIGHLIGHTED SERIOUS

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:48.379
DEFICIENCIES IN THE STATE'S

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.880
PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY AND

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:50.881
INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH AT THE

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:52.116
STATE LEVEL AS WELL AS AMONG

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:53.484
THE SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH

00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:56.453
JURISDICTIONS- BOTH.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.355
DEPARTMENTS AT BOTH LEVELS HAVE

00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.456
HAVE DEALT WITH DECLINING

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:00.925
LEVELS OF FUNDING OVER THE

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:04.261
YEARS AS WELL AS FUNDING THAT'S

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:06.430
HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE IN NATURE.

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:08.933
AND WHILE BOTH- STATE AND LOCAL

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.100
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:11.502
AN INFLUX OF FEDERAL FUNDING

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:13.137
RIGHT NOW THAT FEDERAL FUNDING

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:15.472
IS REALLY- SPECIFIC TO THE

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:17.741
COVERT RESPONSE. ALTERNATELY

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:20.077
TIME LIMITED- THE LEGISLATURE

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.079
MIGHT WISH TO CONSIDER SOME

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:23.380
AMOUNT OF ONGOING ANNUAL

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:25.583
SUPPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:26.517
PUBLIC HEALTH AND LOCAL HEALTH

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:28.886
JUST JURISDICTIONS BEGINNING IN

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:29.854
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.288
ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER EAST

00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:35.559
CENTRAL NON CODE NINETEEN OR-

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:38.162
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES- WE

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.864
WOULD ALSO SUGGESTED THIS

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.832
FUNDING BE SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE.

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:42.967
IN ADDITION THIS FUNDING COULD

00:41:43.033 --> 00:41:44.535
HELP BOTH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:45.669
HEALTH AND LOCAL HEALTH

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:47.004
DEPARTMENTS RETAIN SOME OF THE

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:48.372
STAFF THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.341
HIRE AND TRAIN DURING THE

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:51.842
PANDEMIC AND THEN THE

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:53.110
LEGISLATURE COULD REALLY TAKE A

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:54.778
LOOK AT THE FINDINGS FROM BOTH

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:57.548
OF THE STUDIES- AND SORT OF RE

00:41:57.615 --> 00:42:01.118
CALIBRATE FUNDING LEVELS- AND

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:03.287
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES- ONCE

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:04.989
THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION FROM

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.323
BOTH THE IMMEDIATE. AFTER

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.725
ACTION REVIEW AS WELL AS THE

00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:09.693
MULTI YEAR ASSESSMENT. AND THEN

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:14.398
FINALLY IF THESE- RATHER TO

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:16.166
PREPARE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:17.534
FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS THE

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:18.702
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:20.404
ESTABLISHING A FUNDING RESERVES

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:23.173
THIS YEAR IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY

ABOUT OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.651
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN SET

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:43.420
ASIDE DURING COPE IT. AND AND

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:44.822
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

00:43:44.888 --> 00:43:46.256
I FEEL STRONG SO STRONGLY ABOUT

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:48.292
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR PUBLIC

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.960
HEALTH AT THIS POINT. I THINK

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:52.329
OF MY OWN COUNTIES. AND ONCE IT

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:54.098
ONE IN PARTICULAR. THAT

00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:57.701
RECENTLY IN RECENT YEARS- WAS-

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.270
SEEN UPTICKS IN- SEXUALLY

00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:02.373
TRANSMITTED DISEASES HEPATITIS

00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:08.445
C. H. I. V- AND- PUTTING THAT

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:12.783
IN THE BACKDROP. OF A TEN YEAR.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.852
DECLINE IN THE FUNDING FOR

00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:15.819
PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS AND

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:17.388
PRACTICALLY HAVING TO BEG FOR

00:44:17.454 --> 00:44:20.057
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:22.326
THESE THESE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:23.227
HEALTH ISSUES THAT WERE

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:25.629
SURFACING IN THE COMMUNITY- I

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:27.865
ALSO WANNA NOTE THAT. I THAT

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:29.266
HE- DR GOTTLIEB POINTED OUT

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:31.301
ABOUT HEALTH INFORMATION- AND

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:34.204
THEN THE SYSTEMS THERE HAD OUR

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:36.573
SYSTEMS YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW BEEN

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.375
IN A BETTER SHAPE IN SOME CASES

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.144
OR HAD WE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE WE

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.211
BEEN ABLE TO IF WE ARE ABLE TO

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:43.580
BUILD BETTER HEALTH INFORMATION

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:45.949
SYSTEMS. WE WOULD BE MUCH

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.651
BETTER AT COMMUNICATING WITH

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:49.787
HEALTH ENTITIES ONE ANOTHER AND

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:51.021
WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:53.123
MUCH BETTER HANDLE ON ON

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.825
DISEASE SURVEILLANCE.

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:58.762
THROUGHOUT THE- COMMUNITIES

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:00.297
THAT ARE SHOWING THE GREATEST

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.533
IS DISPARITIES IF WE CANNOT

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:07.871
HAVE THE DATA. TO- TO ANALYZE

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:08.772
IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:10.407
DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET TO THE

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:12.543
POINT WHERE WE CAN IDENTIFYTHE

00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:13.877
ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES WE

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:15.412
DON'T HAVE THE DATA TO BACK IN

00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:16.814
THE BACKGROUND TO SUPPORT THAT.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.248
AND THAT IS IT AND THAT IS A

00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:19.683
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE PUBLIC

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.251
POPULATION HEALTH THE PART THAT

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:23.220
I THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. ONE

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:24.721
OF THE THINGS THAT- THAT DOES

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:27.424
TROUBLE ME A LITTLE BIT IN THE

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:29.726
LISTENING TO THE L. A. O. NEED

00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:32.229
TO DIGEST A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:34.098
WHERE THEY'RE GOING BUT- DO

00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:35.332
WONDER IF THAT IS IF IT DOES

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.233
MAKE SENSE TO BREAK THIS INTO

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.802
PIECES- AND- AND THAT'S

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:40.437
SOMETHING I DIDN'T DIDN'T KNOW

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:42.606
OR DIDN'T EXPECT TO HEAR- AND

00:45:42.673 --> 00:45:45.008
APPRECIATE HEARING THAT. ONE OF

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:45.609
THE THINGS THAT I KNOW WE'RE

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:47.878
GOING TO FACE IS A WORKFORCE

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:49.379
PROBLEM WE'RE ALREADY FACING

00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:51.215
WORKFORCE PROBLEM MANY PUBLIC

00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:52.716
HEALTH- PEOPLE WORKING PUBLIC

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:55.152
HEALTH HAVE BEEN BURNED OUT.

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:57.621
OVER WORKED. AND WE'D WE

00:45:57.688 --> 00:45:59.389
DESPERATELY NEED TO REINVEST IN

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:03.327
WORKFORCE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:03.927
WE SHOULD BE DOING NOW. YEAH I

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:05.028
DON'T SEE THAT WE I DON'T SEE

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.096
THAT A DELAY REALLY REALLY

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.699
HELPS US HELPS US IN THAT. AND

00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:12.536
THEN- FINALLY- I WANNA SEE.

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:16.640
THAT A COUPLE OF THINGS. I'D

00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:17.174
LIKE TO SEE THAT IF WE ARE

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:19.943
GIVING. RE STATE RESOURCES TO

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.845
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.313
GO DIRECTLY TO PUBLIC HEALTH

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.048
DEPARTMENTS AND THAT THERE BE

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:25.949
ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE OTHER

00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:28.285
END- I BELIEVE NOW THAT A LOT

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:30.387
OF MONEY GOES TO COUNTIES IF

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:31.922
I'M WRONG PLEASE CORRECT ME. IN

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:33.524
THE COUNTIES DECIDE WHERE IT'S

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.659
GOING TO GO AND MY EXPERIENCES

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:37.060
THERE IS OFTEN A LITTLE BIT OF

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:37.961
A SHUFFLING AND THINGS ARE

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:40.297
GOING ON THERE AND THAT THAT IF

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:41.632
WE'RE DEDICATING MONEY AT THE

00:46:41.698 --> 00:46:43.300
STATE LEVEL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:45.102
IT NEEDS TO GO TO PUBLIC

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:47.037
HEALTH. BUT IN RETURN FOR THAT.

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:48.372
THERE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:50.607
AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO. SEE

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:52.776
THE SEE THE RESULTS OF THOSE

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:54.611
THOSE- THOSE INVESTMENTS AND SO

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:56.313

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.614
DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ON THE

00:46:57.681 --> 00:46:58.882
OTHER END WANTS TO RESPOND ANY

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.250
OF THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO.

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:36.587
ABOUT THE AFTER ACTION REPORT

STYLE WHICH IS OF COURSE

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:40.958
NECESSARY ON. AN INTERIM AFTER

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:43.727
ACTIONS ARE OCCURRING ALL ALONG

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:47.698
pPANDEMIC RESPONSE FOR THE STATE

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:49.366
FOR THE NATION COUNTY BY COUNTY

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:53.303
IS GOING TO UNDERGO. THOSE

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:54.504
IMPORTANT AFTER ACTION. REPORTS

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:56.006
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT LOOKING

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.908
FORWARD ARM WHAT WAS PROPOSED

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:59.610
AS A POTENTIAL MULTI YEAR

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:02.079
APPROACH I THINK THAT A LOT OF

00:48:02.145 --> 00:48:03.814
THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT CAN

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.717
INFORM SUCH INVESTMENTS OVER

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:09.953
THE LONG TERM- GLOBAL ROLE OF

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.622
PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR STATE. HOW

00:48:11.688 --> 00:48:14.057
IT'S DIVIDED AND STORMS OF

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:15.859
RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:17.694
WITHIN COUNTIES WITHIN THE

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:19.796
STATE ARE POTENTIALLY A

00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:21.531
REGIONAL ASPECT AS WELL IN

00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:23.200
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:25.035
WHERE WORK FORCES CHALLENGED

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:26.837
WHERE SOME OF THE- TOOLS ARE

00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:28.805
NOT IN THE ABUNDANCE THAT YOU

00:48:28.872 --> 00:48:31.341
NEED- IN CERTAIN PLACES WHEN

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:32.676
THERE'S ISSUES THAT ARISE

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:34.878
CRISES THAT ARISE. BUT I DO

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:37.247
BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A HEAD

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:39.116
START ON SOME OF THAT WORK-

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:40.851
COUNTY IS THE STATE HAS BEEN

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:43.520
CONSIDERING- SO MANY OF THESE

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.756
THINGS NOW AND THAT BEING ABLE.

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:48.292
TO DO THAT SOONER THAN MULTIPLE

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:50.761
YEARS IS WHAT OUR BELIEF IS BUT

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.529
VERY MUCH IN THE SAME SPIRIT.

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.998
THAT THE- OF VALUATION IS

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:57.334
COMPREHENSIVE IT'S NOT JUST

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:59.236
LOOKING AT ONE SPECIFIC PART OF

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:00.937
THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE THAT

00:49:01.004 --> 00:49:02.572
EXIST TODAY OF COURSE SOME OF

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:04.708
THOSE TOOLS WILL BE IMPORTANT

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.244
TO MAINTAIN. STRENGTHENED BUT

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:17.754
ALSO. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:18.922
ARCHITECTURE OF HOW HEALTH

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.590
WORKS IN THE STATE. SHOULD BE

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:24.461
OUR READ CANCER RIACH IN THE

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:25.562
AND THAT WE HAVE DONE SOME OF

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:28.165
THE YOUR THING. AND PROCESS OR

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:31.635
ON THAT POINT SO- EXACT. TWO

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:34.738
RICK THE FOR. HAVING TO BRING

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:36.573
TOGETHER THESE CONCEPTS TO

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.008
THOSE QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO BE

00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:40.410
READY AND- THIS JAN WITH

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:42.546
THOUGHT. COMPREHEND PROPOSAL IT

00:49:42.612 --> 00:49:45.582
IS ALL NEVER GOING TO- CAPTURE

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:47.517
EVERY LAW ASPECT OF WILL BE.

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:49.119
CONSIDERING PUBLIC HEALTH IS

00:49:49.186 --> 00:49:56.093
VERY DYNAMIC WELL OF ALL.

CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS IT HAS

00:49:56.727 --> 00:49:59.129
OVER THE YEAR OVER TIME SO. I

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:00.030
WILL NEED TO REMAIN NUMBER. AND

SOME OF OUR SMALLEST COUNTIES

00:50:33.563 --> 00:50:35.298
HAVE DONE REMARKABLY WELL

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:36.900
DURING THIS AS FAR AS THEIR

00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:38.068
PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS AND

TRULY ASTOUNDING SO I HOPE THAT

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:00.891

DELIVERED IS DETERMINED BY YOUR

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:08.892

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:10.660
THE MOMENT THAT IT'S THE LOCAL

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:12.863
JURISDICTION AND THE FUNDING

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.631
LEVEL THAT DETERMINES THE

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:15.198
AMOUNT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CARE

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:17.400
THAT YOU GET. AND THAT SEEMS

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:19.302
COUNTER TO MANY OF THE EQUITY

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:20.871
PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE AND WAS

00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:22.772

MORE EQUITY FOCUSED AND FOR US

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:40.156
THAT MEANS IN PART BUT NOT

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:42.492
ONLY. TO ENSURE THAT RESOURCES

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.828
ARE DRIVEN TO COMMUNITIES THAT

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:47.264
HAVE BEEN GRAVELY IMPACTED I

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.331
THINK ONE THING THAT WE WIL

00:52:48.398 --> 00:52:50.500

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:54.170
THAT UNDERLYING HEALTH

OUTCOMES MORE THAN WE THINK-

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:01.378
THAT THE INCREASE IN MORBIDITY

00:53:01.444 --> 00:53:02.946

ADEQUATELY IN SOME WAYS IT'S

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:32.469
INVISIBLE. AND THAT IS THE

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:34.471
PUBLIC HEALTH LINK TO THE

THIS LEVEL OF TRANSFORMATIONAL

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:01.068
CHANGE IS CHALLENGING. BUT

01:34:01.135 --> 01:34:01.869
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LESSONS

01:34:01.936 --> 01:34:03.604
LEARNED PRIMARILY FROM THE

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:05.206
PRIVATE SECTOR SOME PUBLIC

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:07.408
SECTOR EXAMPLES. FIRST IT'LL BE

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:09.276
VERY IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:12.013
VERY CLEAR GOALS. AND THOSE

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:13.881
GOALS NEED TO BE SHARED BY A

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:15.583
BROAD SET OF STAKEHOLDERS

01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:18.252

SUCCESS. IN THAT PROCESS AND SO

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:35.569
THOSE CALLS NEED TO BE.

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.838
DEVELOPED THROUGH A

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:39.073
CONSULTATION PROCESS. WHAT DOES

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:41.609
GOALS IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:42.443
A WAY TO MEASURE AND MONITOR

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:43.310
PROGRESS THERE WERE SOME

01:34:43.377 --> 01:34:44.512
COMMENTS EARLIER AMONG MEMBERS

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:46.514
OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.416
IMPORTANT IT IS TO. HAVE

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:49.583
CONFIDENCE THAT WE'RE HEADED IN

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:50.584
THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH REAL

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:53.521
TIME INFORMATION ON THINGS LIKE

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:54.555
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE'RE

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.457
SERVING. AT DECLINES IN THE

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:58.192
NEGATIVE OUTCOMES AT

01:34:58.259 --> 01:34:59.794
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE POSITIVE

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:00.694
OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:03.764
SEE THAT IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:04.331
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:05.733
OVER THE YEARS AND IS IT AS IT

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.035
HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE IN THE

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.804
PUBLIC SECTOR. ROSS THE BOARD I

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:12.106
THINK CALIFORNIA IS ARE FARTHER

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:14.275
ALONG IN MANY AREAS THAN OTHER

01:35:14.341 --> 01:35:16.677
STATES ARE. AND THERE'S A LOT

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:17.578
OF OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:19.947
IMPROVE HOW WE DO THAT. SO WE

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:21.282
NEED TO THINK ABOUT THOSE GOALS

01:35:21.348 --> 01:35:23.250
SUCH AS SERVING MORE CHILDREN

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:24.852
REDUCING EXPULSIONS REDUCING

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:26.620
CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.722
REDUCING SUICIDE BUT ALSO

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:30.257
POSITIVE THINGS LIKE IMPROVING

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.226
GRADUATION RATES AS WE TALKED

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:34.161
ABOUT EARLIER. AND IT'S VERY

01:35:34.228 --> 01:35:36.063
IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN TRANSLATE

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:38.099
THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AROUND

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:40.201
THOSE GOALS TO GIVE US REAL

01:35:40.267 --> 01:35:42.570
TIME INFORMATION. MANY TIMES I

01:35:42.636 --> 01:35:44.238
WOULD ADD IT LARGE

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:46.173
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THEM THE

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.475
UNITED KINGDOM HAVE ESTABLISHED

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:49.510
WHAT WE CALL PERFORMANCE UNITS

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:51.312
THAT ARE REALLY DESIGN.

01:35:51.378 --> 01:35:52.713
INDEPENDENT OF THE CHANGE

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:55.216
PROCESS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:35:55.282 --> 01:35:57.218
REALLY MONITOR WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:58.953
THROUGH THE CHANGE PROCESS AND

01:35:59.019 --> 01:35:59.954
TO EQUIP ALL OF THE

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.222
STAKEHOLDERS THOSE WHO ARE

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:02.823
INTERNAL TO THE PROCESS IN

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.525
GETTING THE WORK DONE AS WELL

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:06.627
AS THOSE WHO ARE EXTERNAL. WELL

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:09.163
AS PARTNERS BUT ALSO AS AS THE

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:10.865
SORT OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL IT

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:12.633
PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE OF

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.135
THIS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:15.536
INFORMATION FROM TRUSTED

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:17.438
RESPECTED SOURCES. SO THAT THEY

01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:19.106
CAN CREATE CONFIDENCE THAT THE

01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:20.474
WORK IS BEING DONE IN WAYS THAT

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:21.909
IT WAS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED.

01:36:21.976 --> 01:36:23.043
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:24.812
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:26.447
INFORMATION BEGINS TO CHANGE

01:36:26.514 --> 01:36:28.482
COLORS WHEN CHANGING COURSE IS

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:32.286
THE RIGHT THING TO DO BASED ON

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:32.887
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. ALONG THE

01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:34.722

ON THE INITIATIVE AS A WHOLE-

01:44:08.742 --> 01:44:10.711
FIRST WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT-

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:12.245
ACROSS THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS

01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:13.213
OF THE INITIATIVE THE

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.115
LEGISLATURE. IS GOING TO NEED

AVAILABLE ABOUT THE INITIATIVE.

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:39.239
WE FIND THAT IN GENERAL WHILE

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:40.841
THERE ARE RELATIVELY SMALLER

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:42.442

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:09.603
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- THE

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.538

BE REALIZED UNTIL SOME YEARS

01:45:16.309 --> 01:45:18.445
INTO THE FUTURE- AND TO THE

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:19.312
EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:21.948
WISHES TO PRIORITIZE- GETTING

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:23.116

MONDAY MORNING AT EIGHT THIRTY-

01:49:49.449 --> 01:49:50.917

PERFORMING THE OVERSIGHT OTHER

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:09.536

AND ALL OF THE OUTCOMES

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:20.480
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TO SEE ARE

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:22.248
WE SPENDING THE MONEY AND

01:50:22.315 --> 01:50:23.183
GETTING THE RESULTS WE WANT

01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:25.151
THAT'S CALLED ACCOUNTABILITY-

01:50:25.218 --> 01:50:26.119
IN OUR THAT IS OUR DATA

01:50:26.186 --> 01:50:27.721
COLLECTION SO THAT WE CAN

01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:29.055
ACTUALLY TRACK PROGRAM

01:50:29.122 --> 01:50:30.890
OUTCOMES. SO WHO IS THE ACT

01:50:30.957 --> 01:50:31.992
WHEN I VISIT WHAT I'M

01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:33.860
VISUALIZING HERE IS LIKE A BUSY

01:50:33.927 --> 01:50:36.062
AIRPORT A LOT OF PLANES COMING

01:50:36.129 --> 01:50:39.532
AND GOING BUT NO AIR TRAFFIC

01:50:39.599 --> 01:50:40.100
CONTROLLER. IN THAT'S THAT

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:41.601
TROUBLES THAT TROUBLES ME WE'RE

01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:43.937
TALKING ABOUT PROGRAMS WITH FOR

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.605
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PLEASE

01:50:45.672 --> 01:50:47.440
DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND WE NEED TO

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:48.908
SPEND THESE RESOURCES WE

01:50:48.975 --> 01:50:50.677
ABSOLUTELY NEED TO INVEST IN

01:50:50.744 --> 01:50:52.278
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. FOR YOUNG

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:54.781
PEOPLE FOR OLD PEOPLE AND

01:50:54.848 --> 01:50:56.383
EVERYBODY IN BETWEEN IT'S A

01:50:56.449 --> 01:50:58.318
HUGE HUGE ISSUE. BUT WHAT I

01:50:58.385 --> 01:51:01.721
DON'T SEE. IS A COORDINATION OF

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:03.957
EFFORT AND WHEN I WORRY ABOUT.

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:06.059
IS THAT THE MONEY GOES INTO

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:09.229
SILOS. AND THE SILOS DON'T TALK

01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:10.897
WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND THAT

01:51:10.964 --> 01:51:12.465
THERE MIGHT BE DUPLICATION THEY

01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:14.801
MIGHT BE OVERLAP AND WE MIGHT

01:51:14.868 --> 01:51:15.902
NOT GET THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:17.804
LOOKING FOR AND SO AS I MAKING

01:51:17.871 --> 01:51:19.539
NOTES HERE LISTENING TO PEOPLE

01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:21.374
I WANT TO. COMP THAT COMMENT

01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:24.310
THAT- MISTER EWING BROUGHT UP.

01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:26.146
SOME OF THESE THINGS. WE NEED

01:51:26.212 --> 01:51:28.448
TO ESTABLISH GOALS. WE NEED TO

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:30.483
MEASURE AND MONITOR PROGRESS.

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:32.085
WE NEED REAL TIME INFORMATION

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:33.553
WE NEED REAL TIME INFORMATION

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.555
ACROSS HEALTHCARE IN GENERAL WE

01:51:35.622 --> 01:51:37.557
DON'T HAVE IT. AND MORE

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:39.726
IMPORTANTLY. WE NEED TO USE

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:41.594
THAT INFORMATION AND BE NIMBLE

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:43.663
ENOUGH TO MAKE CHANGED COURSE

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:47.033
CHANGES. AND THAT'S SOMETHING

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.268
THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T OFTEN

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:50.303
DO- AND THEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.404
TO EVALUATE OUTCOMES TO MAKE

01:51:51.471 --> 01:51:51.938
SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:54.140
SPENDING THE MONEY ON IN THE

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:56.543
MOST APPROPRIATE WAY. SO CAN I

01:51:56.609 --> 01:51:57.243
KNOW SOMEBODY FROM THE

01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:58.645
ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE ANSWER

01:51:58.711 --> 01:51:59.846
WHO IS GOING TO BE THE

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:02.382
OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION OF

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:04.584
ALL OF THESE EFFORTS. SO THERE

01:52:04.651 --> 01:52:08.088
THERE IS A PERSON OR ENTITY

01:52:08.154 --> 01:52:10.123
THAT WE CAN GO TO AND GET. REAL

01:52:10.190 --> 01:52:15.595
TIME INFORMATION. HAZ I'D BE

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:16.529
MORE THAN HAPPY TO STEP IN

01:52:16.596 --> 01:52:18.198
GIVEN THAT DR KELLY HAD TO STEP

01:52:18.264 --> 01:52:19.899
AWAY FOR A MOMENT AND SO I

01:52:19.966 --> 01:52:21.067
THINK ONE OF THE PIECES THAT

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:22.502
WAS MENTIONED IN HIS OVER YOU

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:23.837
WHAT'S REALLY THE BALL THAT

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:25.472
AGENCY WILL BE PLAYING IN

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:27.340
REGARDS TO THIS PROPOSAL AND

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:29.642
THEY WILL NOT ONLY BE LEADING A

01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:31.544
CROSS DEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION

01:52:31.611 --> 01:52:33.780
AS HE REFERENCED A BUT THEY

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:35.048
ALSO PLAN ON CONVENING AND

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:36.683
ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS

01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:38.318
INCLUDING A YOUTH FOCUSED

01:52:38.384 --> 01:52:39.719
ENGAGEMENT BURKE HOW TO MAKE

01:52:39.786 --> 01:52:41.187
SURE THAT ALL OF THE DECISIONS

01:52:41.254 --> 01:52:42.589
ARE BEING PULLED ACROSS THESE

01:52:42.655 --> 01:52:44.057
VARIOUS INVESTMENTS. ARE YOU

01:52:44.124 --> 01:52:45.225
CAN SEE WITHIN THE PROPOSAL

01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:46.693
THERE ARE KEY COMPONENTS THAT

01:52:46.759 --> 01:52:48.928
ARE ONGOING THE BIRCH WALL THAT

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:50.396
DIRECT SERVICES THROUGH THE

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:52.265
VIRTUAL POPCORN THE ECON SALT

01:52:52.332 --> 01:52:53.967
ON THE LINKAGE WITH SCHOOL-

01:52:54.033 --> 01:52:55.001
SERVICES IN COMMUNITY BASED

01:52:55.068 --> 01:52:56.970
ORGANIZATIONS BUT A LOT OF THE

01:52:57.036 --> 01:52:58.404
INVESTMENTS IN THESE FIRST FEW

01:52:58.471 --> 01:52:59.706
YEARS WILL BE REALLY BUILDING

01:52:59.772 --> 01:53:00.807
THAT FOUNDATION FOR THOSE

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:01.841
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:03.376
SURE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:04.911
THOSE EARLY INTERVENTIONS AND

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:08.014
WHAT WORKING ACROSS- AS WELL AS

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:09.215
HOW THAT PLAYS INTO THE LONG

01:53:09.282 --> 01:53:11.084
TERM KIND OF INVESTMENTS FOR

01:53:11.151 --> 01:53:12.952
THAT PROGRAM AND SO. I THINK

01:53:13.019 --> 01:53:15.088
THERE IS- MANY PLANS TO HAVE A

01:53:15.155 --> 01:53:16.356
LARGE STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:18.391
WOULD BE INFORMING ON THAT WORK

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:19.359
WE WOULD HAVE THE- THE A

01:53:19.425 --> 01:53:20.693
PROPOSAL FOR WHAT WE'RE CALLING

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.695
IT A BEHAVIOR HEALTH THINK TANK

01:53:22.762 --> 01:53:23.796
WHICH WOULD HAVE SUBJECT MATTER

01:53:23.863 --> 01:53:25.598
EXPERTS ON THAT WOULD HELP

01:53:25.665 --> 01:53:28.101
INFORM BEST PRACTICES LEAKAGES

01:53:28.168 --> 01:53:29.869
HOW WE SHOULD BE BUILDING OFF

01:53:29.936 --> 01:53:30.937
OF THESE THINGS TO BE AS

01:53:31.004 --> 01:53:33.206
EFFECTIVE. AS POSSIBLE IN THE

01:53:33.273 --> 01:53:35.275
FUTURE I'M IN TO REALLY DO IT

01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:37.877
RIGHT AND THEN LASTLY A REALLY

01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:40.246
DEVALUATION COMPONENTS STARTING

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:42.148
EARLY IT'S WHY EVEN- BRING ON

01:53:42.215 --> 01:53:44.083
THE EVALUATORS IN YOUR WANT TO

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:45.051
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THINKING

01:53:45.118 --> 01:53:46.186
ABOUT THE EVALUATION FROM THE

01:53:46.252 --> 01:53:48.021
BEGINNING OF THIS PROGRAM WHAT

01:53:48.087 --> 01:53:49.322
ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHAT

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:50.723
ARE THE METRICS WE WOULD LIKE

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:53.393
TO YOU- TO TRACK INTO OVERSEE

01:53:53.459 --> 01:53:55.495
AS WE BUILD THIS PROGRAM OVER

01:53:55.562 --> 01:53:56.663
MANY MANY YEARS AND SO I THINK

01:53:56.729 --> 01:53:58.932
THE COMBINATION OF THE MULTIPLE

01:53:58.998 --> 01:54:01.067
DEPARTMENTS BEING LED BY AGENCY

01:54:01.134 --> 01:54:03.036
THE STAKEHOLDER. GROUP THAT

01:54:03.102 --> 01:54:04.304
WILL INFORM MUCH OF THIS

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:06.372
BEHAVIOR HEALTH THINK TANK AND

01:54:06.439 --> 01:54:08.341
THE EVALUATION ON THAT THE

01:54:08.408 --> 01:54:09.909
AGENCY WOULD BE PUTTING PARK

01:54:09.976 --> 01:54:16.015
ARE ALL MANY COMPONENTS. THAT

01:54:16.082 --> 01:54:16.583
WOULD ADDRESS ON WHAT YOU'RE

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.685
RAISING. IT AND THOSE AROUND.

01:54:18.751 --> 01:54:19.652
BUT THERE WAS WORK ALL COME BUT

01:54:19.719 --> 01:54:20.386

REALLY DO WANT TO GET TO THE

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:44.277
MEAT OF THE ISSUE HERE. IS THAT.

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:46.546
YOU KNOW CAN WE TAKE THAT. THAT

01:54:46.613 --> 01:54:47.413
PERSON IS GOING TO BE

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.481
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THESE

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:50.483
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND

AND LINK THESE THINGS TOGETHER.

01:55:01.494 --> 01:55:03.463
FROM THEIR INDIVIDUAL SILOS.

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:05.498
AND REALLY GET TO THE MEAT OF

01:55:05.565 --> 01:55:07.300
THE ISSUE FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:09.035
ARE HOMELESS NOW THERE'S OTHER

01:55:09.102 --> 01:55:10.870
CAUSES FOR HOMELESSNESS AND

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:11.871
THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER REASONS

01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:13.906
HERE. BUT THE ACE OF

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:15.341
HOMELESSNESS THAT WE SEE AS WE

01:55:15.408 --> 01:55:18.344
WALKED THE STREETS. I BEG TO

01:55:18.411 --> 01:55:20.947
ARGUE THAT MUCH OF THAT IS

01:55:21.014 --> 01:55:22.448
POTENTIALLY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:23.616
SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER

01:55:23.683 --> 01:55:26.486
COMBINATIONS OF THAT. BUT YOU

ALL TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER TO

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.195
COORDINATE THESE EFFORTS. AND

01:55:36.262 --> 01:55:38.564
THAT'S WHAT I DON'T SEE. I SEE

01:55:38.631 --> 01:55:40.600
A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT I DO I

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:42.101
AGREE WE SHOULD SPEND BUT I

SECRETARY IS A CENTRAL AVENUE

01:56:44.063 --> 01:56:46.666

MICHIGAN VERY COME TO IT- BUT

01:56:56.976 --> 01:56:58.878
IT I THINK WE ALL THAT THERE

DEPUTY LEVEL INDIVIDUAL TO LEAD

01:57:22.502 --> 01:57:24.103
THIS INITIATIVE BECAUSE OF THE

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:25.772
FACT THAT IT CROSSES OVER THE

01:57:25.838 --> 01:57:27.473
MULTIPLE PAIRS AND BECAUSE OF

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:28.741
THE FACT THAT THE FUNCTION OF

01:57:28.808 --> 01:57:30.343

PROCESS OF BEING ARRESTED AND

IT'S REALLY WHAT I CONSIDER AN

02:13:29.101 --> 02:13:32.771
IMPERATIVE FIRST INITIAL-

02:13:32.838 --> 02:13:36.308
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP. AND I GIVE

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:38.076

SOME LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. I

02:13:39.711 --> 02:13:41.513
DON'T HEAR ANY INTEGRATION WITH

02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:42.748
THE REGIONAL CENTRES. NOT ONE

02:13:42.814 --> 02:13:48.487
BIT. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE

02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:50.822
PANEL HANDLES WHO. OUR

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:52.457
COMMITTEE WOULD LOOK AT THE

02:13:52.524 --> 02:13:56.428
DOCUMENTARY A DANGEROUS SON.

02:13:56.495 --> 02:13:57.662
WHERE FAMILIES HAVE TO GO

02:13:57.729 --> 02:14:00.232
THROUGH THIS DUAL DIAGNOSIS

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:01.833
WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND

02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:03.201
MAYBE A MODERATE TO SEVERELY

02:14:03.268 --> 02:14:08.373
AUTISTIC. OF CHILD THERE IS A

02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:10.642
COMPLETE CONNECTION HERE WHERE

02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:13.945
THIS HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED WERE

02:14:14.012 --> 02:14:14.913
THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE TO

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:16.882
HAVE AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP

02:14:16.948 --> 02:14:19.184
WITH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

02:14:19.251 --> 02:14:20.519
THIS MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT IS

02:14:20.585 --> 02:14:24.856
ABSOLUTELY- NEEDS TO GO FORWARD.

02:14:24.923 --> 02:14:27.492
THE OTHER IS THAT- YOU KNOW

02:14:27.559 --> 02:14:29.561
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SCHOOLS IT

02:14:29.628 --> 02:14:31.363
IS PRESENT THAT'S THE PERFECT

02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:33.498
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE MOST

02:14:33.565 --> 02:14:35.000
CONTACT WITH THESE CHILDREN IN

02:14:35.066 --> 02:14:37.202
WHICH I ABSOLUTELY AGREE ONE

02:14:37.269 --> 02:14:39.037
HOP WHOLEHEARTEDLY. BUT HOW

02:14:39.104 --> 02:14:40.338
COME THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION

02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:43.508
WASN'T INCLUDED. HOW COME THEY

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:44.409
WEREN'T ASKED WHAT IT WOULD

02:14:44.476 --> 02:14:46.511
TAKE IN THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS

02:14:46.578 --> 02:14:47.646
AS THE EXPERTS WITH THESE

02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:49.347
CHILDREN WHAT IT WOULD TAKE

02:14:49.414 --> 02:14:52.284
COST WISE WERE EFFECTIVENESS TO

02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:53.785
BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE THIS

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:56.588
PROGRAM. THEY'RE NOT HERE. AND

02:14:56.655 --> 02:14:59.224
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND. AND A LOT

02:14:59.291 --> 02:15:00.725
OF THIS IS GRANT INCENTIVIZED

02:15:00.792 --> 02:15:12.604
SO IT'S IF THEY DON'T. WANT TO

02:15:12.671 --> 02:15:13.238
GO OUT FOR THE GRANT THEY DON'T

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:13.805
HAVE TO. JUST PAY. WHEN YOU

02:15:13.872 --> 02:15:14.406
LOOK THE SCHOOLS EL CAP THEY

02:15:14.473 --> 02:15:15.106
HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS BY THEY

02:15:15.173 --> 02:15:15.674
DON'T HAVE THIS CYCLE COULD

02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:17.075
PASS THEN HAVE THE ANYMORE SOME

02:15:17.142 --> 02:15:17.709
SCHOOLS HAVE EVEN OPTED OUT OF

02:15:17.776 --> 02:15:20.679
THE S. OKAY SO. WHAT DOES IT

02:15:20.745 --> 02:15:21.980
TAKE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

02:15:22.047 --> 02:15:24.182
CAPACITY OF GIVING INDIVIDUALS

02:15:24.249 --> 02:15:26.051
INTO THESE SCHOOLS AND THE

02:15:26.117 --> 02:15:29.020
SCHOOLS WOULD NOT. SO I WOULD

02:15:29.087 --> 02:15:31.056
HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT.

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:32.457
PARTNERS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:15:32.524 --> 02:15:34.226
EDUCATION ARE SUPERINTENDENT

02:15:34.292 --> 02:15:36.661
HON TONY THURMOND TO DETERMINE

02:15:36.728 --> 02:15:39.998
AND THEN. WHAT IS MR WHAT IS

02:15:40.065 --> 02:15:43.335
SAID CONTABILIDADE. HAND HOW

02:15:43.401 --> 02:15:45.136
COMES OR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

02:15:45.203 --> 02:15:46.972
BE DERIVED TO WHAT WE'RE

02:15:47.038 --> 02:15:47.572
EXPECTING WITH THIS EXPENSIVE

02:15:47.639 --> 02:15:52.010
MONEY- YOU KNOW I REALLY DO

02:15:52.077 --> 02:15:54.279
THINK THAT THE PEER TO PEER

02:15:54.346 --> 02:15:56.681
MENTIONED EARLIER IS IMPERATIVE

02:15:56.748 --> 02:15:58.016
BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA THAT GOES

02:15:58.083 --> 02:16:03.054
ALONG WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH-

02:16:03.121 --> 02:16:04.990
UNFORTUNATE STIGMA ARE THEY

02:16:05.056 --> 02:16:06.625
JUST WE REALLY DO NEED TO

02:16:06.691 --> 02:16:09.160
ENGAGE OUR CHILDREN. FOR A PEER

02:16:09.227 --> 02:16:12.230
TO PEER SO FOR SUPPORT AND I

02:16:12.297 --> 02:16:12.831
THINK THAT'S WE'RE GONNA GET A

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:16.535
LOT OF THE- INITIAL RESULTS OF

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:20.338
SUCCESS- AND THEN ALSO WHEN WE

02:16:20.405 --> 02:16:22.207
TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW PARTNERING

02:16:22.274 --> 02:16:23.542
WITH ORGANIZATIONS WHY HASN'T

02:16:23.608 --> 02:16:26.678
HAD ME. BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS.

02:16:26.745 --> 02:16:27.946
WE DON'T NEED TO RECREATE THE

02:16:28.013 --> 02:16:30.649
WHEEL WITH THEM INVOLVED I MEAN

02:16:30.715 --> 02:16:31.283
THEY'VE GOT IT THEY DO IT AND I

02:16:31.349 --> 02:16:35.053
NATION WIDE. AND SO I'M HOPING.

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.122
THAT WE BROADEN OUR OUR OUTLOOK

02:16:37.188 --> 02:16:40.992
ON. THE ITV POPULATION WITH DDS

02:16:41.059 --> 02:16:43.161
THE REGIONAL CENTERS. ON THAT

02:16:43.228 --> 02:16:44.329
WE PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT

02:16:44.396 --> 02:16:47.332
OF EDUCATION. TO FOR- A

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:50.001
PARTNERSHIP AS- WE LOOK FORWARD

02:16:50.068 --> 02:16:54.906

HOPEFUL OUTCOME HELPFUL IN AND

02:16:56.875 --> 02:16:58.910
I THINK ONE OF THE LAST THINGS

02:16:58.977 --> 02:17:01.580
ARE CLOSE ON HIS THAT. ONE OF

02:17:01.646 --> 02:17:04.049

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:16.227
HOPING THAT WE ADDRESS THE I

02:17:16.294 --> 02:17:17.462
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THROUGH

TIME IN THAT CHILD IS NOT HELD.

02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:27.439
THAT THAT CAN BE EXTENDED. THAT

02:17:27.505 --> 02:17:32.611
pCHILD OR THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS

02:17:32.677 --> 02:17:35.380

03:26:32.079 --> 03:26:33.714
RELATED TO SORT OF WHICH MEDIC

03:26:33.781 --> 03:26:35.750
CAL IN ROWLEY POPULATIONS WITH

03:26:35.816 --> 03:26:37.485
GROW AT FASTER OR SLOWER RATES.

03:26:37.551 --> 03:26:39.487
NAMELY RECOGNIZING THE TRENDS

03:26:39.553 --> 03:26:41.021
IN ACTUAL CASELOAD GROWTH THAT

03:26:41.088 --> 03:26:43.257
SHOW SLOWER GROWTH AMONG SOME

03:26:43.324 --> 03:26:44.925
HIGH COST POPULATIONS SUCH AS

03:26:44.992 --> 03:26:45.793
SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH

03:26:45.860 --> 03:26:47.862
DISABILITIES AND FASTER GROWTH

03:26:47.928 --> 03:26:49.897
AMONG. LESS COSTLY POPULATIONS

03:26:49.964 --> 03:26:51.132
SUCH AS THE ACA OPTIONAL

03:26:51.198 --> 03:26:53.367
EXPANSION THIS CHANGE IN THE

03:26:53.434 --> 03:26:54.969
ASSUMPTION AS A RESULT AS IN

03:26:55.035 --> 03:26:56.203
ADDITION TO LOWERING THE

03:26:56.270 --> 03:26:57.671
OVERALL CASELOAD GROWTH

03:26:57.738 --> 03:26:59.940
ASSUMPTIONS REALLY CONTRIBUTE

03:27:00.007 --> 03:27:01.776
TO THE DECLINE- THAT THE

03:27:01.842 --> 03:27:04.178
DOWNWARD REVISION IN ESTIMATED

03:27:04.245 --> 03:27:06.147
COSTS. OVER THE FULL FOUR FULL

03:27:06.213 --> 03:27:09.283
BUDGET THAT- WINDOW HERE.

03:27:09.350 --> 03:27:11.252
OVERALL THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:27:11.318 --> 03:27:12.586
CASE ARREST MEN'S AND THE

03:27:12.653 --> 03:27:14.088
RELATED COST PROJECTIONS

03:27:14.155 --> 03:27:15.489
GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH THE L.

03:27:15.556 --> 03:27:18.425
A. O.'S EXPECTATIONS AND-WHILE

03:27:18.492 --> 03:27:20.094
WE NOTE THAT THERE IS SOME RISK

03:27:20.161 --> 03:27:21.529
THAT COST COULD COME IN

03:27:21.595 --> 03:27:22.429
SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE

03:27:22.496 --> 03:27:24.698
ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS- WE DO

03:27:24.765 --> 03:27:26.300
NOT RECOMMEND ANY CASE THAT ARE

03:27:26.367 --> 03:27:27.601
RELATED TO JUST MEANS TO THE

03:27:27.668 --> 03:27:31.672
MAY REVISION. BUDGET AT THIS

03:27:31.739 --> 03:27:32.973
TIME. SO I JUST TURN TO I

03:27:33.040 --> 03:27:35.209
NUMBER. ON THE I'M- OLDER

03:27:35.276 --> 03:27:37.678
ADULTS EXPANSION AND JUST A

03:27:37.745 --> 03:27:39.079
SECOND THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:27:39.146 --> 03:27:41.682
COMMENTS THAT- THE ESTIMATES OF

03:27:41.749 --> 03:27:43.784
THE ADMINISTRATION AND- OUR

03:27:43.851 --> 03:27:44.752
OFFICE ARE NOT DIRECTLY

03:27:44.819 --> 03:27:46.620
COMPARABLE- ACTUALLY FOR A

03:27:46.687 --> 03:27:48.756
COUPLE OF REASONS ONE THE MAIN

03:27:48.823 --> 03:27:50.024
ONE BEING THAT WE USE DIFFERENT

03:27:50.090 --> 03:27:51.759
SORT OF AGE GROUPS THAN HAS

03:27:51.826 --> 03:27:54.361
ACTUALLY BEEN PROPOSED AND SO-

03:27:54.428 --> 03:27:54.962
THERE'D HAVE TO BE SOME

03:27:55.029 --> 03:27:56.764
MODIFICATIONS THERE. AND THEN

03:27:56.831 --> 03:27:58.432
THE SECOND IS THAT IT SPECIALLY

03:27:58.499 --> 03:28:00.134
FOR THE ONGOING COST ESTIMATE

03:28:00.201 --> 03:28:02.069
WHICH IS EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY

03:28:02.136 --> 03:28:02.903
SIX MILLION DOLLARS UNDER THE

03:28:02.970 --> 03:28:05.039
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. THAT

03:28:05.105 --> 03:28:06.974
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT SEVERAL

03:28:07.041 --> 03:28:08.409
EXTRA YEARS OF COST GROWTH

03:28:08.475 --> 03:28:10.277
WHEREAS OUR ESTIMATE- REALLY

03:28:10.344 --> 03:28:12.279
REFLECTED COSTS AS WE EXPECTED

03:28:12.346 --> 03:28:13.514
THEM TO BE ASSUMING FULL

03:28:13.581 --> 03:28:15.983
IMPLEMENTATION IN IN TWENTY ONE

03:28:16.050 --> 03:28:17.952
TWENTY TWO- WE ARE CURRENTLY

03:28:18.018 --> 03:28:18.986
REVIEWING THE ADDITIONAL

03:28:19.053 --> 03:28:19.920
DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE

03:28:19.987 --> 03:28:21.388
ADMINISTRATIONS AND OUR

03:28:21.455 --> 03:28:23.457
ESTIMATE- BUT ARE WAITING BACK

03:28:23.524 --> 03:28:25.059
UP TO. REALLY BE ABLE TO DIVE

03:28:25.125 --> 03:28:26.393
INTO WHICH IS SOME GINS MAY

03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:28.696
DIFFER FROM WHAT WE DO NOW WE

03:28:28.762 --> 03:28:31.599
DO THINK THAT- DIFFERENCES IN

03:28:31.665 --> 03:28:33.834
CASELOAD ARE EXCUSE ME AND COST

03:28:33.901 --> 03:28:35.636
GROWTH COULD BE- COULD BE

03:28:35.703 --> 03:28:37.137
CONTRIBUTING AS WELL AS

03:28:37.204 --> 03:28:38.706
DIFFERENCES AROUND- I HSS

03:28:38.772 --> 03:28:40.541
COSTS. AND ULTIMATELY BOTH OF

03:28:40.608 --> 03:28:41.675
THESE ARE SUBJECT TO A LOT OF

03:28:41.742 --> 03:28:42.743
UNCERTAINTY BUT WE WILL LOOK

03:28:42.810 --> 03:28:44.612
INTO THIS- LOOK INTO THIS

03:28:44.678 --> 03:28:47.548
FURTHER- NEXT I'LL JUST TURN TO

03:28:47.615 --> 03:28:49.750
THAT MEDIC CAL POPULATION

03:28:49.817 --> 03:28:51.719
HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE. AND

03:28:51.785 --> 03:28:53.320
OVERALL WE DO FIND THAT THIS

03:28:53.387 --> 03:28:55.189
PROPOSAL COULD IMPROVE MEDIC

03:28:55.256 --> 03:28:56.490
CAL PERFORMANCE MODERATE
