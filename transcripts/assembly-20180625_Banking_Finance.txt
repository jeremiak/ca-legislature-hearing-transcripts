COMMITTEE FOR MONDAY JUNE TWENTY FIFTH AM I BELIEVE. ONE WE DO HAVE QUITE WERE SHORT COURSE SHORT. ONE WE'RE SHORT ONE A QUORUM SO WE WILL START OUR COMMITTEE HEARING -- AS ASIDE UNTIL WE HAVE. AN ADDITIONAL MEMBERS. AT WE DO HAVE ASSIGNING LESS TIME AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH -- SENATOR GLACIER FOR SP TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WE DIDN'T PUT ANY TIME LIMITS ON IT BUT A WILL ASK FOR BREVITY AND IN IN COMMENTS THAT ARE MADE SO. WITH THAT I WILL HAVE YOU BEGIN SENATOR THE THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR LEMOND. US SENATE BILL TWELVE THIRTY FIVE I WOULD GIVE TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. MANY OF THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT OUR COUNTRY'S TRUTH IN LENDING LAWS HAVE GIVEN CONSUMER BORROWERS FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE LENDERS AND FINANCE COMPANIES. TO PROVIDE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT DISCLOSURE. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHEN THEY OFFER THEM FINANCING AND WHEN THEY CLOSE THE DEAL. THIS INFORMATION WOULD HELP SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS UNDERSTAND THE COST AND THE CONSEQUENCES. BUT THE FINANCING OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM. IN THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING COMMERCIAL LENDING MARKET. UNTIL NOW OUR TRUTH IN LENDING LAWS APPLIED ONLY TO CONSUMER FINANCE. BUSINESS OWNERS WERE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. ON THE THEORY THAT THEY WERE SOPHISTICATED MERCHANTS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE WORLD OF FINANCE. INCREASINGLY HOWEVER THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE. TODAY'S SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE OFTEN IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS STRUGGLING TO GET THEIR ENTERPRISES OFF THE GROUND WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FINANCE INDUSTRY. TRADITIONAL BANKS MEANWHILE ARE NO LONGER INTERESTED IN MAKING SMALLER LOANS INSTEAD THAT SPACE IS BEING FILLED BY INNOVATIVE LENDERS OFFERING AN ARRAY OF FINANCIAL OPTIONS. THIS NEW ONLINE LENDING INDUSTRY IS BRINGING CAPITAL TO PEOPLE WHO BADLY NEEDED. BUT THERE ARE ABUSES. THIS BILL OFFERS A MODEST MEASURE DISCLOSURE. TO HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA LEADER IN PLACE IN THE INTERESTS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. ON PAR WITH THE BIG PLAYERS IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. NOW IF YOU BORROWED MONEY FOR A HOUSE OR A CAR SIMPLY TAKING OUT A PERSONAL LOAN OR USED A CREDIT CARD. SEEN THE KIND OF DISCLOSURES THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE. THEY TELL YOU HOW MUCH YOUR BORROWING ALL THE FEES YOU'LL BE PAYING. HOW LONG WILL TAKE YOU TO REPAY THE LOAN AND THE ANNUAL ANNUALIZED INTEREST RATE? THE LENDERS KNOW ALL THIS INFORMATION ALREADY. SOME OF THEM EVEN DISCLOSE IT IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS WHEN THEY PACKAGE THEIR SMALL BUSINESS LOANS AND SELL THEM AS SECURITIES. ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THE SCHOOL THAT THEY DISCLOSE THE SAME INFORMATION TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. IT'S GOOD FOR WALL STREET SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR MAIN STREET. THIS BILL IS UNDERGONE EXTENSIVE CHANGES SINCE I FIRST INTRODUCED IT IN FEBRUARY. WE'VE TAKEN SUGGESTIONS FROM MANY OF THE PLAYERS THEM IN THIS INDUSTRY AND FOR MOST OF THE OPPONENTS. BUT WILL NEVER SATISFY EVERYONE. MANY THE COMPANIES THAT LEAD TO SMALL BUSINESS. SIMPLY DO NOT WANT TO DISCLOSE THE TERMS OF THEIR LOANS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND MANY CONSUMER FINANCE ADVOCATES WHAT THIS BILL TO PRECISELY MERE THE LAWS THAT GOVERN CONSUMER LENDING. EVEN IF THAT MIGHT NOT BE PRACTICAL FOR THE BUSINESS LENDING MARKET. LET ME FINISH UP I THINK WE'VE STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE IN THIS BILL REQUIRES CLEAR CONSISTENT DISCLOSURE. BUT DOES NOT RESTRICT THE KIND OF FINANCING THE LENDERS CAN OFFER. AND WILL NOT LEAD TO ANY LOSS OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL IN THE SMALL BUSINESS WORLD. WITH ME TODAY A ROBIN BLACK REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. AND I CATON HANSEN WHO WAS A CO FOUNDER OF NAP DOT COM A COMPANY THAT HELPS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS NAVIGATE THE TRICKY NEW ONLINE LENDING MARKETPLACE. THANK YOU CHARLIE KNOWN IN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME. TO SHARE MY SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WHEN I'M SKATING HANSEN CO FOUNDER AND CHIEF LEGAL COMPLIANCE OFFICER AT NAB DOT COM. NOW THE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT FINANCE PLATFORM USED BY MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS HELPING SMALL BUSINESS BORROWERS MORE EASILY COMPARE SOURCES OF CAPITAL. WHICH ULTIMATELY MEANS MORE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. CONSIDER THE IMPACT THIS LEGISLATION CAN HAVE SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES NEARLY HALF OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA STATE EMPLOYEES. BUT ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSE EACH YEAR. THE DATA SHOW TOP REASON THESE BUSINESSES FELL. IS DUE TO POOR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS. I CO FOUNDED NOW FOR THE VERY REASON OF BRINGING TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY TO BUSINESS FINANCING CREDIT. I COME FROM SMALL BUSINESS FAMILY MY GRANDFATHER STARTED A POOL PLASTERING COMPANY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT MY COUSIN RUNS THE SAME BUSINESS TODAY. GROWING UP I WATCHED MY FATHER WORK A FULL TIME JOB. AND RUN SMALL BUSINESS ON THE SIDE. AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OF TWO VISITS PRIOR TO NAV I'M INTIMATELY AWARE OF THE HELP THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. I'VE SEEN OUR STRUGGLE ON A DAILY BASIS AND HAVE BEEN IN THEIR SHOES. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FEEL LIKE THE SUCCESSES. OF YOUR BUSINESS HANG ON WHETHER YOU HAVE THE RIGHT FINANCING OR NOT. TRANSPARENCY INEFFICIENCY VERY IN THE BUSINESS LENDING WORLD. IF YOU HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED IT IT'S EASY TO SAY THE BORROWER WILL FIGURE IT OUT. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THE REALITY IS THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE NOT FINANCIAL EXPERTS. THESE ARE NOT FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES ARE TALKING ABOUT IN FACT. 75% OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES EMPLOY ONE OF FEWER PEOPLE. THESE ARE BUSINESSES WITHOUT A FINANCE DEPARTMENT RUNNING A BUSINESS AND HAVING TO PERFORM FINANCE HR. SELLS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. IS EXTREMELY TAXING BUSINESS OWNERS CAN'T SPEND HOURS AND HOURS TRYING TO DECIPHER LOAN DISCLOSURES. THAT'S ONE ANNUALIZED COST OF CAPITAL NEEDS TO BE A PART OF THIS LEGISLATION. THE BEST METHOD WE HAVE TO CREATE A QUICK APPLES TO APPLES COST COMPARISON. WE'VE HAD IS PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS FOR YEARS IT'S ALREADY SETTLED LAW. THE BILL'S OPPOSITION CLAIM AN ANNUALIZED COST OF CAPITAL WILL CONFUSE BORROWERS THE FACT IS THAT AN ANNUALIZED RATE WHICH INCLUDES ALL COSTS. WE'LL SIMPLY REVEAL HOW EXPENSIVE SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS CAN BE. IF THIS FORCES THEM TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM CAPITAL. AND THE EFFECT THAT HAS ON AN ANNUALIZED RATE AND SO BE IT. IT'S BETTER THAN THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT PUTS ALL THE BURDEN ON THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. WE'VE ALREADY AGREED THAT ARE THAT USING AN ANNUALIZED RATE IS THE BEST WAY FOR CONSUMERS TO COMPARE LOANS WHY SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. MOST REPUTABLE BUSINESS LETTERS ALREADY PROVIDE AN ANNUALIZED RATE BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR A BORROWER TO COMPARE LOANS. IN TERMS ALTERNATE BLENDER SUCH AS CABBAGE ON JACK IN SMART BUSINESS LOANS. ARE USING TOOLS SUCH A SMART BOX. TO PROVIDE NECESSARY DISCLOSURES. THEY KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THIS BILL IS JUST A WAY TO STANDARDIZE AND REQUIRE THIS ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. SO THAT THE FEW BAD APPLES CAN'T CONTINUE TO SEE BUSINESS OWNERS THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT REGULATING THE CASA BUSINESS LOANS ARE TRYING TO HARM BUSINESS LINERS WHICH WE WOULDN'T SUPPORT. THERE ARE LEGITIMATE TIMES WHEN A TRIPLE DIGIT ANNUALISED RATE IS A SMART DECISION FOR BUSINESS OWNER. BUT THE BUSINESS OWNER DESERVES TO HAVE A CLEAR WAY OF COMPARING PRODUCTS AND KNOWING HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST THEM. IF THE TERMS ARE TRANSPARENT A BUSINESS OWNER MAKES A BAD DECISION THAT IT'S ON THEM. TO CLAIM EDUCATING A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ON THE TRUE COST OF CAPITAL IS A HARM TO THEM IS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. UNLIKE THE OPPONENTS WE HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN BY PASSING THIS BILL WE JUST KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE ALSOBELIEVE IT CAN BECOME A MODEL FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT MILLIONS OF BUSINESS. OWNERS THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. ON BEHALF OF THE HUNDRED TEAM MEMBERS IT NOW. ALONG WITH OUR THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I URGE YOU TO PASS THE BILL THANK YOU. I WILL ASK FOR A QUORUM AND IF WE CAN JUST BEFORE WE FINISH UP IF WE CAN JUST CALL FORM. HE WON'T HEAR LIMON HERE CHEN. ACOSTA HERE COSTA HERE BURKE GABRIEL. GABRIEL HERE GLORIA [inaudible] GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER HERE GRAYSON. GRAYSON HERE STEINORTH. STEINORTH HERE STONE WEBER [inaudible] WEBER HERE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ROBIN BLACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. I'M WE ARE A NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF YOU WERE AT OUR LUNCHEON LAST WEEK WITH YOUR HONOREES AND WE LOVE SMALL BUSINESS WE CELEBRATE SMALL BUSINESS. AND WE REALLY WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AS ALL OF YOU KNOW ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGE FACING SMALL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND START UP BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR IN CALIFORNIA. AS HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED. ARM THAT TRANSPARENCY THAT THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE FOR OUGHT SMALL BUSINESSES LOOKING FOR THAT KIND OF CAPITAL SPECIAL IN THE NEW MARKETS ONLINE. IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I WON'T REPEAT EVERYTHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID. BUT INFORMING THE CONSUMERS GIVING HIM THE TRANSPARENCY THAT IS ALREADY THERE FOR CONSUMER LOANS IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDING IT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES MANY OF THEM WHO. ARE MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT AS SOPHISTICATED AND AND THE FINANCE OF LAWS AND THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE TRUE COST OF A LOAN OR BORROWING MONEY CAN BE. THIS WILL GO A LONG WAYS TO HELP THOSE AND CESSATION WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WHERE CHAIR I FOUND [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION. I SUPPORT DYING. WE'LL START WITH SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE STATE YOUR AT NAME AND ASSOCIATION. ON BEHALF THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE ASSOCIATION SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. ALRIGHT THOSE IN OPPOSITION FALL OF GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AND PATTERSON IN A MINUTE PARTNER AT OR ACCOUNTANTS AYCLIFFE AN OUTSIDE COUNSEL FOR THE INNOVATIVE LENDING PLATFORM ASSOCIATION. I'M PHILLIP COMING THEATER IN THE ROUND HERE [inaudible] AND WE'RE HERE REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SB -- TWELVE THIRTY FIVE BECAUSE OF THE INCLUSION OF THE UNTESTED NEW METRIC THE ECC THAT ISN'T WELL. THE AYE OKAY IS THE LEADING TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR SMALL BUSINESS LENDING AND SERVICE COMPANIES AND OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE ON DECK CAPITAL CABBAGE AND THE BUSINESS BACKER. I WANT TO START BY MAKING IT CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT OPPOSE S. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVES OBJECTIVE HERE AND ITS ATTEMPTS TO CREATE DISCLOSURES ON WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY AND ACTUALLY. AT THE WITNESS FROM NOT MENTIONED ALL MEMBERS OF THE I OP A ALREADY PREPARED TO PROVIDE BORROWERS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE DISCLOSURE. SCHOOL DOES NOT BOX LOOKS LOW BUT LIKE THE SCHUMER BOX OR FOR THOSE OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH CHEERIOS THE NUTRITIONAL LABEL ON THE BACK AYE OF THAT -- WE SPENT ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS DEVELOPING ABOUT THE SMART BOX AND WORKED IN CONSULTATION WITH SMALL BUSINESSES TO IDENTIFY THE METRICS THAT WERE MOST MEANINGFUL TO THEM WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO COMPARE BETWEEN HIGH FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THOSE METRICS REFLECTED HERE WE HAVE TOTAL COST OF CAPITAL AT THE TOP WHICH USUALLY RANKED AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST MOST -- MEANINGFUL FOR FOLKS. WE DISCLOSED APR I ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE AVERAGE MONTHLY PAYMENTS SENSE ON DOLLAR AND WHETHER THERE ARE ANY PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. I'M SO I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY CAN'T SEE THIS FROM HERE I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE IRAQ COPIES OF PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE IT -- MORE CLOSELY SO WE REALLY WE DID MAKE THESE DISCLOSURES VOLUNTARILY BECAUSE WE WANT OUR SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO BE INFORMED SO THAT THEY CAN PICK THE RIGHT FINANCING PRODUCT FOR THEIR USE CASE. AND WE DO BELIEVE AND I THINK AS THE AUTHOR. AND BUT WE STRONGLY -- OPPOSE THE TWELFTH SIR S. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVES INCLUSION OF THIS UNTESTED NEW METRIC THE ACC OR E. ACC -- BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL FRUSTRATE RATHER THAN FACILITATE AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON ACROSS PRODUCTS. AND HERE'S WHY. I'M A LITTLE [inaudible] CARD. AS YOU CAN SEE APR AND ACC LOOK A LOT ALIKE. THEY'RE BOTH PERCENTAGES. I'M WHICH IS GOING TO CAUSE CONFUSION FOR BORROWERS AND THESE TWO HERE APR AND ECC. ARE THIS ARE FOR THE EXACT SAME LOAN ONE SIXTH MONTH FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN WITH THE EXACT SAME INTERESTS AND FEES. APR THIRTY THREE POINT SIX ACC TWENTY TWO POINT. SIX THREE ONCE LOOKING A LOT HIGHER THAN THE OTHER FOR THE EXACT SAME LOAN WITH THE SAME COSTS. SO THIS IS BASICALLY ACC JUST LIKE IS A PR BUT SMALLER -- THAT'S WHAT SORT OF LIKE INTRODUCING A NEW FEDERAL FOOD MEASUREMENT FOR EXAMPLE WHERE I CAN LOOK AT THE SENATE BOND AND SAY. OH DOESN'T HAVE NINE HUNDRED CALORIES ANYMORE IT HAS SIX HUNDRED CALORIES -- AND I THINK JUST LIKE THAT WOULD DRIVE PEOPLE TO MAKE BAD FOOD DECISIONS ON THIS A C. IT'S GONNA TENSELY MISLEAD FARMERS INTO CHOOSING POTENTIALLY MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO CONFLATE APR. AND ECC THE DANGER IS GOING TO OCCUR HERE BECAUSE BORROWERS ARE GOING TO BE COMPARING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS ONE COULD WITH A PR AND ONE ACC. LOTS OF THINGS ARE STILL GOING TO BE QUITE AND APR THE SCHUMER BOX IN YOUR CREDIT CARD IS STILL GOING TO HAVE A PR. AND I CAN TELL YOU THE CREDIT THAT -- SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS ORGANIC. P. R. THIRTY THREE THE ONE THAT SAYS THIS AND IT'S JUST LOWER IT'S LIKE BUYING THE CINNABAR UNDERTAKEN SUDDENLY YOU'RE GONNA PICK THE ONE THAT LOOKS LOWER -- EVEN THOUGH IN FACT IT'S NOT. THE ACTUALLY LESS EXPENSIVE PRODUCT IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT METRIC ENTIRELY -- SO THE PROBLEM IS GOING TO I THINK NOT GO AWAY OVER TIME WITH THIS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN AN ECOSYSTEM. WHERE APR REMAINS? YOU KNOW THE PROMINENT METRICS SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE TRYING TO REALLY DOING APPLES TO ORANGES COMPARISONS BETWEEN APR AN ECC. ACROSS THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY JUST SPECULATION ON WE'D SPENT I THINK I MENTIONED A LOT OF HOMEWORK WHEN WE DEVELOPED SMART BOX. OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS ONE OF THINGS WE DID IS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED PUTTING A SECOND PERCENTAGE METRIC THE AIR INTO THE SMART BOX THAT WOULD HAVE HAD. WHEN MORE PERCENTAGE HERE AND WHEN WE SHARED THAT WITH SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IT IMMEDIATELY CAUSE CONFUSION THERE LIKE WHICH ONE'S THE REAL? ONE WHICH ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE AND SO IT JUST LED TO A TONIC QUESTIONS AND SO WE ULTIMATELY SAID. ONLY ONE PERCENTAGE BASED METRIC ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING TO CONFUSE PEOPLE. AND SO I THINK THE CONCERN FOR US IS THAT WHERE YOU ARE NOW IN A POSITION AS THE AISLE PSA. OF HAVING TO DROP APR ENTIRELY AND REPLACED IT WITH THE THIS NEW METRIC WHICH IS UNTESTED FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO'S EVER USED IT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE BEEN ANY STUDIES. ON WHETHER OR NOT IT ACTUALLY KIND OF WORKS OVERTIME. SO WE REALLY COULDN'T REPLACE IT OR WE CAN GO BACK TO SITUATION WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE TO PERCENTAGES ON THE SMART BOX AGAIN. WHICH WE KNOW BASED ON OUR OWN BACK DOES CAUSE CONFUSION FOR PEOPLE SO WE CLOSING. WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT HERE AYE WE BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE BUT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS MATTER WILL BE CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE INHABITING THREE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR LIMON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TESTIMONY TODAY REGARDING S. B.. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE MY NAME IS KATE FISHER AND I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMERCIAL FINANCE COALITION. A GROUP OF RESPONSIBLE FINANCE COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE CAPITAL TO SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES THROUGH INNOVATIVE METHODS. WE SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE BUSINESS FINANCING DISCLOSURES. CFC MEMBERS ALREADY DISCLOSED ACOSTA FINANCING AND WELCOME ALL OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF S. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE EXCEPT. FOR ONE THAT IS THE ESTIMATED ANALYZE COST OF CAPITAL DISCLOSURE. FOR CLARITY WE DO NOT OPPOSE DISCLOSURE INSTEAD WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR AN EFFECTIVE AND ACCURATE DISCLOSURE. OUR CONCERN IS THAT REQUIRING ANY ANALYZE PERCENTAGE FOR FINANCING THAT IS NOT ALONE. WILL MISS CHARACTERIZE THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION AND SENATOR GLAZERS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT REQUIRING AN ESTIMATED ANALYZE COST OF CAPITAL DISCLOSURE DOES NOT MAKE SENSE FOR OTHER NON LOAN PRODUCTS. SO JUST COMMERCIAL LEASING OR INVOICE FACTORING. COMMERCIAL LEASING IS COMPLETELY EXEMPT FROM S. B.. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE AND INVOICE FACTORING IS EXEMPT FROM THE ANALYZE COST OF CAPITAL DISCLOSURE. THAT IS BECAUSE COMMERCIAL LEASING AN INVOICE FACTORING ARE NOT LOANS. BUT S. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE PROPOSES TO REQUIRE AN ANNUALIZED ACOSTA CAPITAL DISCLOSURE FOR FUTURE RECEIVABLES FACTORING. ALSO NOT ALONE. THIS IS A LOGICAL. FUTURES HE WILL SPECTRUM IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ALONE. THE BUSINESS PART PAYS ONLY A PERCENTAGE OF ITS RECEIVABLES FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WILDFIRES SWEPT ACROSS CALIFORNIA LAST FALL A BUSINESS THAT WAS DAMAGED THEY COULD NOT OPERATE WOULD OWE NOTHING. BECAUSE THE TRANSACTION IS NOT% ALONE ANY APR OR ANALYZE COST OF CAPITAL DISCLOSURE WHICH WOULD ONLY CONFUSE AND MISLEAD SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WAY IN PROVIDING BUSINESSES WITH DISCLOSURES THAT ARE HOPEFUL AND NOT MISLEADING. FOR EXAMPLE THE DISCLOSURE AYE IN SP TWELVE THIRTY FIVE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF TOTAL DOLLAR COST OF FINANCING WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN THE BILL AND SECTION TWENTY TWO ITO TO BE THREE THANK. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITIONPLEASE STATE YOUR NAME [inaudible] AND ASSOCIATION. RIGHT HEARING ARE SEEN THEN I'M MEMBERS WE WILL TURN IT OVER TO YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS ASSIGNED NUMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I I WAS HEARING THE TESTIMONY ABOUT APR VERSES A CC. AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE YOU I IT WAS SOUND LIKE HE WAS APPLES AND ORANGES. RIGHT COMPARED BETWEEN THE TWO SO AS LONG AS THE CONSUMER OR IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE THE BUSINESS OWNER THAT WASN'T SEEKING A COMMERCIAL LOAN. WAS AWARE THAT -- THEY WERE APPLES AND ORANGES THEN THIS LONG AS THEY WERE ALIGNING THE APPLES TOGETHER OR THE ORANGES TOGETHER. AND COMPARING THE RIGHT RATES THEN IT WOULD. THERE WOULD BE CONFUSION IS THAT RIGHT [inaudible] THAT IF. FORGOT PASSED THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THEM AND ACTUALLY SORT OF DIE AGAIN -- THEY COULD POTENTIALLY SEC ACC IS FORM IS BASICALLY COMPUTER COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY AND IS IT SIGNED TO BE A DIFFERENT METRIC. I THINK THE HARD PART IS WHEN YOU JUST SEE IF YOUR ACC WE'VE SEE RATES PEOPLE ARE MAKING QUICK DECISIONS AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO SEE. 36% 23% AND JUST. GO WITH THAT WHEN THE OTHER THINGS I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC HERE IS THAT THE UNDERLYING DIFFERENCES I WON'T EVEN BEGIN TO TRY TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE TRYING TO SAY WHICH WOULD WE KNOW. TRYING TO SAY WITH Y. APR IS IS COMPUTED ONE WAY AND Y. ACC'S COMPUTER THE OTHER WAY. IS GOING TO BE COMPLICATED AND TAKE UP A LOT OF TIME ON THE PHONE WHERE PEOPLE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHICH ONE'S THE REAL ONE THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT. SHIRT SO IF WE WERE COMPARING PRODUCTS. WHETHER THAT PRODUCT IF FROM -- THREE TO WAS USING A P. ARE. THAT I WOULD HAVE A FAIR COMPARISON BETWEEN. SO IF I HAD ALL THREE PROVIDERS ALSO PROVIDING AN A CC. AND THEY WERE BEING COMPARED STRICTLY AMONGST STCC THERE WOULD BE A FAIR COMPARISON IT WOULD BE AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT THEY WILL HAVE IT DOING STRAIGHT UP IN RENO REAL TIME AIR APPLES TO APPLES IS GOING TO BE. THAT CREDIT CARDS WILL NEVER BE USING AN ACC THERE RIGHT THERE OFTEN WONDER TEAL I YOU KNOW PROGRAM WITH THAT WITH THE SHAME OF OXEN ARE GOING TO CONTINUES IF YOU ARE. NOT A SMALL BUSINESSES RELY AND NOT SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE IT OUT ORANGE AN APPLE MAYBE A COUPLE APPLES IF YOU PAIR NOT JUST APPLES AND ORANGES. ELEMENT RE-ATTEMPT. TO DEPART FROM AN AP ARE AND COME UP WITH THIS NEW UNTESTED ACC -- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION NOT ALTHOUGH I WOULD NICK AGREE WITH THE UNTESTED PART BUT I ORIGINALLY IN MY BILL I DID HAVE A PR AND OPPONENTS CAME IN AND SAID. WE DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE A P. R.. BECAUSE I A. P. R. CHANGES WITH EVERY PAYMENT YOU MAKE CHANGES THE NUMBER AND THEY CITY CREATES LEGAL VULNERABILITY. OF FOR US TO AT A TO USE APRS OKAY THE PURPOSE HERE IS NOT TO CURTAIL SMALL BUSINESS LENDING. OUT WE NEED THAT CAPITAL OUT THERE THE ONLY ISSUE I WANT US DISCLOSURE I DON'T TO CREATE LEGAL LIABILITY. SO I SAID OKAY BECAUSE AP ARE CHANGES WITH EVERY PAYMENT LET'S COME UP WITH ANOTHER AT METRIC THAT'S NOT AND I KNEW METRIC BUT A METRIC IN THE IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS THAT SAYS. LET'S TAKE A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. OF WHAT THAT WOULD COST OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. AND THAT'S WHAT THE ANNUALIZED COST OF CAPITAL ACC. IT'S NOT BASED ON WHAT YOU MAKE MORE PAYMENTS THIS MONTH OR LESS PAYMENTS NEXT MONTH. IT'S ONE SNAPSHOT. THEREBY PROVIDING A FAIR ESTIMATE WITHOUT LEGAL VULNERABILITY AND A VERY SIMPLE STANDARD AND THAT'S WHERE A CC HAS COME FROM. SO HOW DO YOU SAID WITHOUT LEGAL OF VULNERABILITY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF A CC IS THAT. YOU COULD DRAW A FIGURE OUT THERE AND IT ACTUALLY NOT BE THE EXACT FIGURE THAT CREATES LIABILITY ON THE LENDERS PART WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO BE ABLE -- TO MEDICAID THAT LIES IN THE BILL THAT SAYS AN ESTIMATE IT SAYS AN ESTIMATED ANNUALIZED COST OF CAPITAL SO THAT'S THE REQUIRE DISCLOSURE AND THAT THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK PROVIDES FOR UP APPROPRIATE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR ANY LENDER WHO'S PROVIDING THAT CAPITAL THAT PROPOSAL TO WITHIN THEIR DISCLOSURE YOU'RE SAYING IF YOU PUT ESTIMATE ON THEIR THAN THAT WOULD. HELP MITIGATE AND I CERTAINLY HAVEN'T HEARD ANY CRITICISM SINCE THE ON THAT ON THOSE TERMS IN REGARD ACC RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS RESTORATION. THANK YOU ENSURE BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I KNOW IS REPUBLICAN ONE THINGS THAT. IS ALWAYS A CONCERN IS GOVERNMENT OVERREACH ON THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT YOU KNOW MY OPINION THIS THAT BILL ONE WHICH IS HELPFUL FOR THE LENDER ITSELF THE CONSUMER. IS INFORMATION THAT IS HEALTH FORM WHICH WILL PREVENT THEM FROM MAKING DECISIONS THAT WILL BE FINANCIAL DURESS. OF FOR THEM IN THE FUTURE SO I APPRECIATE BRING THIS BILL FORD AND SO WITH THAT SAID I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL WE HAVE YEAH SO I I JUST CURIOUS FOR THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL IF YOUR POST -- ACC IN YOUR POST A PARENTS ARE METRIC THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND AND SUGGEST. WE ARE ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF IP TO DISCLOSE AYE APR NOW SO WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO IT HERE THINK THERE WERE PEOPLE ON IN THE IN THE IN THE DESK WE DON'T LET THEM SPEAK. YEAH THANK YOU THIRD OF TOTAL COST TOTAL DOLLAR COST OF FINANCING WHICH IS NOT A PERCENTAGE BUT SAYS TELLS THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER THIS IS HOW MUCH THE MONEY WILL COST. THAT IS THE BEST METRIC AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE ON THE THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE OF A MEASUREMENT THAT WORKS ACROSS DIFFERENT PRODUCTS SO THAT MEASUREMENT WORKS WHETHER IT'S A LOAN OR A SALE. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED. BUT NO IT'S I MEAN NOT NOT BY BY LAW IT IS REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED -- BY CONTRACT SO THAT THE THAT CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF BODIES IN THERE GETTING AND THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP I REPRESENT. DO UP PROVIDE DISCLOSURES LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW AND DID A SURVEY OF SMALL BUSINESSES PART OF THAT TOTAL COST OF CAPITAL WAS SOMETHING WE DOLLARS AND DOLLARS OUT THE IN THE DAY THAT IS WHAT IS MOST MEANINGFUL TO THEM I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU KNOW ANALYZE METRIC OR WHATEVER. THE PROBLEM WITH ANALYZE METRICS GENERALLY IS THAT THE SHORTER THE TERM OF THE LOAN THEY JUST LOOK A LOT IT THIS STARTS TO FALL APART AND PER YEAR -- BUT I BUT TO THE POINT THAT THAT THAT YOU MADE THAT BOTTLE OF CAPITAL IS SOMETHING THAT BUSINESS OWNER SAY IS THE METRIC IT'S WHITES AT THE TOP OF OUR SMALL BOX [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER WEBER. JUST WANTED TO GET SOME CLARITY -- NOW THIS SMART BOX THAT YOU HAVE -- HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THE SMART BOTTOM IS A SOMETHING THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO WOULD HAVE TO YEARS OR SOMETHING NEW WE LAUNCHED A IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR TWO YEARS? OKAY EN AND BUT IT'S NOT REQUIRED IS NOT IT'S A VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY MODEL ANYBODY WHO JOINS I'LL PA MUST DISCLOSE THAT AS PART OF THAT MEMBERSHIP SO. YOU HAVE SOME OF THE LARGER LANDERS LIKE ON TECH AND CABBAGE USING IT ON BUT IT IS NOT MANDATORY IS NOT MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT. HUMPIN. OKAY SO THEREFORE IT'S KIND OF AN UN EVEN THING IN TERMS OF WHO HAS ACCESS TO IT WITH THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE REAL COST OF THEIR LOANS ARE YEAH. THERE'S NOT THERE'S NO MANDATE TO MAKE THESE DISCLOSURES CONTENT AND THE INDUSTRY INITIALLY WAS A POST APR. AND I ASSUME WE STILL ARE I WOULD IMAGINE. HASTHERE BEEN SOME REVELATION EVERY. IT IS OF THE COMPANIES THAT FINANCING COMPANIES THAT DON'T OFFER LOANS BUT OFFER A TYPE OF FACT DREAM PROGRAM. SO THEY ARE OPPOSED TO ANY TYPE OF ANALYZE METRIC BECAUSE THOSE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS DON'T HAVE A TERM. BUT THE THE BUSINESS ONLY PAYS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUE AS THAT REVENUES CREATED. SO THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL TAKE AS LONG AS IT TAKES AS LONG AS IT TAKES A BUSINESS TO GENERATE THE REVENUE. THAT THEY WILL THEN DELIVER TO THE COMPANY -- AND I ASSUME THAT ANY NEW SYSTEM THAT YOU COME UP WITH WILL BE UNTESTED I MEAN THAT'S THE NATURE OF SOME NEW -- IF IT DOES NOT IT WOULD BE OLD RATHER THAN. IT BEING SOMETHING NEW SOME NOT NECESSARY PERSUADED BY THE UNTESTED ELEMENT OF THAT. I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE SOME TRANSPARENT OUT THAT MUCH TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF COMMERCIAL LOANS I JUST ASSUME EVERYBODY HIT TRANSPARENCY IN NEW WITH IT ALONE COST AND AND SO I FOUND IT. RATHER INCREDIBLE THAT THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN NOT SURE I'M CONVINCED ACC IS THE BEST THING BUT I AM HURTING BY TELL ME THING ELSE. I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE A PR VOTE MUCH BUT I THINK THAT HER THAT ACC SO HORRIBLE. I'M PROBABLY GOING TO SUPPORT THIS AS IT GOES FORWARD WITH HOPES THAT WHATEVER PROBLEM THERE IS YOU GUYS WORK IT OUT BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR OF NOT SURE. NOVEL FOR ON THE FLOOR BUT I WANT TO I DO WANT TO GIVE LIFE TO THIS SO THEY CAN THE CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE BECAUSE I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES SAW SECOND THE MOTION THAT WAS MADE. THANK YOU NUMBER WEBER AND I THINK WE HAVE A SITE NUMBER ACOSTA AND THEN A SUMMER GABER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AYE AYE AYE. CAN I APPRECIATE DISCOURSE TODAY YOU KNOW APPRECIATE -- CENTER GLAZER. COMING BY AND WE HAVE THINGS. SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS IT IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TO THE END. INTRODUCING A NEW METRIC BY WHICH UP. ZOOMER IS WHICH I KNOW WE'RE CALLING THEM BUSINESS OWNERS BUT THEY'RE STILL PEOPLE ON THE STOCK OF CREDIT CARDS AND AUTO LOANS AND MORTGAGES. AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE CALCULATED SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY SO I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE -- FOR MORE DISCLOSURE -- I I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES ARE FROM SAN DIEGO SYMPATHIES THAT THIS MAY TOP BE THE BEST ANSWER -- BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE ALL CALCULATED DIFFERENTLY WHETHER IT'S TRUE FACT YOU KNOW. A TRADITIONAL FACTORING -- WHETHER IT'S FUTURE RECEIVABLES UP MY CONCERN. HAS BEEN AND THAT. IS IT AS A CONSUMER AND THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER BECAUSE ARE STILL INDIVIDUALS ARE STILL PEOPLE. THAT YOU'RE ON ONE SIDE OF THE FENCE YOU'RE GETTING A CREDIT CARD OFFER A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN OFFER FROM ONE ENTITY ON YOUR CREDIT CARD IT POPPED UP ON MY SCREEN FROM ONE OF MY BANKS STATEMENTS THE OTHER DAY -- AND THEN OVER ON THIS SIDE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE WILL BE CONFUSION THERE I THINK [inaudible] BOB. YOU HAVE MADE ATTEMPTS. TO TO TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS -- I THINK THAT WE NEED. GOOD DISCLOSURE IN THIS ROUND -- CAN YOU TELL ME THE THE JUST FOR THE RECORD THE SUNSET DATE ON THIS WE HAVE A SENSE OUT OF WHAT. VOTE FOR YOUR YEARS SO. I'M NOT THRILLED WITH. NO DISCLOSURE NOT SURE THIS IS BUT I I THINK THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT A PR DOESN'T WORK ACC MAY NOT WORK WE GOTTA TRY SOMETHING -- YOU'VE. SEEM TO HAVE -- BE VERY INTERESTED IN MAKING SOMETHING WORK SO I'D REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO FIX THINGS -- TO THEIR LIKING AND AND REALLY TRY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT. THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN SINK THEIR TEETH INTO YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU'RE GONNA INVENT SOMETHING NEW HERE THAT'S GOING TO CARRY THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY I DON'T KNOW. UP I'M NOT A HUNT PERCENT COMFORTABLE WITH. THE DISCREPANCIES THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE GOING TO BE FINDING THEMSELVES BUT IT'S A STEP AND SO I'M GOING TO BE. ARE WE GOING TO BE TAKING A LOOK AT THIS I I'M I MAY LAYOFF AT THIS MOMENT. BUT I'M LEANING TOWARD SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY JUST SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BUT I'M RESERVING JUDGMENT ON THE FLOOR. FOR WHAT THE FINAL PRODUCT IS THANK YOU. AS AN ADVOCATE. AND A SUMMER LA. ONE YEAH I JUST WANTED TO OUR ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN DIEGO I APPRECIATE SENATOR GLAZER YOUR YOUR EFFORT TO DO THIS AND BRING TRANSPARENCY TO THE SPACE I THINK THAT'S A VERY WORTHWHILE OBJECTIVE -- I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT YOU TODAY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND AGAIN A RESERVE JUDGMENT ON THE FLOOR JUST. TO HELP MYSELF -- YEAH I UNDERSTAND THIS WILL. THANK YOU I'M CHAIR -- AND CENTER THANK YOU FOR THE BILL TODAY -- I'M READING IT FURIOUSLY AFTER BEING SUBSTITUTED IN JUST A FEW A FEW HOURS AGO -- CORRECT BUT IT HAS THE MEDIUM SIZED BOX RIGHT AND I KNOW USUALLY YOU BRING OF COMMONSENSE APPROACH HERE LEGISLATING OUR STRUGGLING WITH THE CONVERSATION TURNS TO DEFER METRICS I THINK I HEARD THAT PART OF IT. FORGIVE ME IF I MISSED THE PORTION WHEN YOU ADDRESS THE ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS IN MY QUICK READ OF THIS -- WAS SOMEWHAT TROUBLING TO ME IS THE FOURTH PAGE OF THE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ANALYSIS TALKING ABOUT THE THE ABILITY OR LACK THEREOF TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. HOW OR ENFORCEMENT -- ON THIS -- IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IF WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME WAY OF TRYING TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE WHAT YOU TRY TO DO WITH THIS BILL IN THE IT'S I WOULD SAY. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING THAT SAYS THAT WHAT IT SAYS HERE IN TERMS OF HAVING. THE THEIR SILENT OR MORE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. TO IT -- WHO HOME FOLKS? WHY THE BILL'S ITS CURRENT STATE IT WITH THESE COMMENTS? ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU LA ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- THERE ARE SOME THAT WOULD LIKE TO REGULATE AND DIE AND THE THING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. THAT WE'D RATHER START WITH THE STEP OF DISCLOSURE AND NOT LICENSING AND NOT REGULATION IN THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT THE MARKETPLACE CAN ACT APPROPRIATELY DISCLOSED APPROPRIATELY. AYE AND THAT CAN BE THE END OF IT. UP BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW IF YOU HAVE A DAY CONTRACT DISPUTE YOU HAVE THE SAME REVENUES UNDER THIS BILL IS PROPOSES YOU WOULD IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE THAT YOU HAVE TODAY. AND OUR PUBLIC LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE THAT SAME ABILITY IF THEY CITY. OF VIOLATIONS THAT TO ENGAGE IS APPROPRIATE ITSELF SO. THE SAME REMEDIES THAT EXISTS TODAY -- WITH -- WHO YOU KNOW ARE ARE IN PLACE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF REGULATION? AND I IT WAS MY VIEW THAT I COULD YOU GET FOLKS FROM ALL SIDES ON THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND IT IS IT. IT'S IT'S A NEW -- ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE IT IS THE WILD WEST TODAY. THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT WE HEARD FROM WHAT SHE DOES THIS AND THEY DO THAT THERE IS NO REQUIREMENTS ANYWHERE IN THIS SPACE -- IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- AND SO IT WAS AT IT THAT CONTEXT THAT I SEE THAT MY FEELING WAS I AND WE TOOK A LOT OF AMENDMENTS TO NARROW THIS BILL I CAN GO THROUGH THOSE I HAVE THE FIRST STEP SHOULD BE A SIMPLE DISCLOSURE MECHANISM -- WITH THE SUNSET. AND THAT WE CAN EVALUATE IT AS IT GOES I DON'T WANT TO CURTAIL THE LENDING MARKET WHATSOEVER -- BUT IF WE HAVE BAD ACTORS THAT CONTINUE DID NOT FOLLOW THOSE RULES THAT I'M VERY OPEN TO TRYING TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS WAS REQUIRED AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE TAKEN A SMALL STEP TODAY THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU. SO YOU'RE YEAR THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED IN A FUTURE COMMITTEE OR BEFORE COMES TO THE FLOOR AIDS IT IS THE INTENT TO TO LEAVE IT -- SORT OF OPEN AT LEAST AT THIS POINT AGAIN GIVEN THAT VARIOUS PLAYERS IN THIS IN THE IN THE SPACE -- THAT THE SMALLER STEP TO ME WOULD SEEM TO BE THE MORE APPROPRIATE STEP NO IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO PUT A NEW REGULATORY. I FRAMEWORK UNDER THIS BILL I THINK THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT AND LISTEN. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPOSITION APR OF FROM THE START WE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT PLACE TODAY BUT I TRY TO ACCOMMODATE. A OPPOSITION AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE NARROWNESS OF THIS BILL BEFORE YOU. I'M OKAY THANK YOU. A SOMBER TALES ELECTRIC. AND I'M OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OPPOSITION WAS TAPE PR ALL OF THIS IS NEW TO ME AND FAIRLY NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT I AM CONCERNED -- WITH KIND OF I DON'T SAY UNSOPHISTICATED BUT YOU KNOW MY FATHER HAS HAD SMALL BUSINESSES AND HAS MADE DETERMINATIONS WHETHER HE PUT SOMETHING ON A CREDIT CARD VERSUS TAKES OUT SOME SORT OF LOAN -- WHAT? IS THE ACC ALWAYS GOING TO BE SMALLER THAN THE A PR I I REALLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THESE THINGS. IT DEPENDS ON THE DURATION -- AT IT IT'S IT'S IT'S MEANT TO SAY OVER TWELVE MONTHS THAT WOULD SEE THERE'S A LOT OF LOANS IN THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT SPACES I STATE YOU NEED A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A PIZZA OVEN REPAIR. AND AND I I CITY LISTEN I'LL GIVE YOU A THOUSAND DOLLARS A COST YOU TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THIS IS WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAID THAT. SMALL VISIT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT TOTAL COSTS WELL IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO GET A THOUSAND DOLLARS NOW AND YOU HAVE TO PAY IT BACK WHEN. WILL HE HAVE TO PAY IT BACK IN NINETY DAYS THAT INTEREST RATE THAT YOUR PAIN IS GONNA BE A LOT HIGHER THAN YOU CAN THAT PAID BACK IN A YEAR. OR HE PAID IT BACK BASED ON TAKING A PENNY OUT OF EVERY CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION. I THINK SO WHEN THESE LENDERS COMMAND THEY CAN OFFER YOU THIS WIDE ARRAY OF WAYS IN WHICH IT'S NOT GONNA COST YOU ANYTHING TO YOUR DAD. I'M AND THAT'S BEEN THE CHALLENGE THAT THE ISSUE OF THAT THE ANNUALIZED COST OF CAPITAL TO SAY WHETHER YOU TAKE THAT LOAN FOR NINETY DAYS OR FOR TWO YEARS. YOU HAVE A AN ANNUALIZED COSTS AS IF IT WAS FOR TWELVE MONTHS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE KNOWING HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST YOU. YOU CAN SHOP THE NEXT VENDOR AND THE NEXT FINANCIER AND HAVE AN APPLES TO APPLES TO COMPARE IT TO BECAUSE ONE VENDOR MAY SAKE PAY ME UP PAY ME IN SIX MONTHS. ANOTHER ONE WILL SAY WILL EIGHTEEN MONTHS WELL WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND SO THAT ANNUALIZED COST AS A WAY TO HAVE THAT ONE STANDARD. REVIEW WHEN WE I DID DO A CHART HERE. I THINK IF YOU A SENSE OF THESE OF THE STANDARDS REQUIRED BY THE BILL. AND AT THE BOTTOM OF IT SAYS WHAT'S THE ANNUALIZED COST OF CAPITAL YOU HAVE A WAY OF REVEALING THAT THIS. THIS CHART IS BASED THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE TIME. OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME AND SO EACH OF THE STEPS. IT'S CLOSED AND THEN THIS IS THE LAST ONE THE BILL THAT'S BEING DEBATED TODAY WHAT'S THAT ANALYZE COSTS BE PAID OVER TWELVE MONTHS. THIS IS A FIFTEEN MONTH EXAMPLE FOR THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD BE OVER TWELVE AND YOU CAN A PARENT FROM PERSON TO PERSON HURT OUR LENDER TO LENDER IS LONG AS THE PRODUCT YOU'RE GETTING IS ALL FROM LIKE. THE I THINK WHAT I'M. STRUGGLING WITH IS YOU'RE MAKING AN ASSUMPTION THAT THEY'RE LOOKING JUST AT THIS ONE PRODUCT RIGHT THIS ONLINE. PRODUCT IN YOUR NOT THINKING THROUGH LIKE WELL I HAVE SPACE ON THIS CREDIT CARD I HAVE THE ABILITY YOU KNOW IN IT FOR NOT USING THEN THE SAME PERCENTAGE. THEN IT'S BIAS TO THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GET A LOWER PERCENTAGE THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED DOES THAT MAKE SENSE IT SO NOW ME IF I FEEL REALLY IGNORANT ENOUGH SPACE IDOLS I I DON'T KNOW AND LISTEN WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF SMALL BUSINESS LENDING OKAY. RIGHT WHEN WE'RE EVEN US HAVE TO HAVE STRUGGLE WITH THAT SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE BASED ON A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ONE TIME LOAN PAID OFF. OVER A IS IT THAT THREE ABOUT THREE YEARS AND AM. NOW. HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT NOW IT'S PAID OFF. A LITTLE OVER A YEAR. A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AND IT COMES FROM UP MONEY MONEY OUT OF YOUR SEATS IS. AGAIN THIS IS THE FIFTEEN MONTH LONG ONE TIME THIS IS THIS IS MONEY OUT OF YOUR CASH REGISTER OVER A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THESE CHARTS THAT WORK OUT. UNDER THIS ONE IT'S A HUNDRED FIFTH THEY'RE BOTH A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS IS THE TOTAL COST OF THE ALL YOUR PAYMENTS IS ONE SEVENTY THAT'S ONE SEVENTY NINE HERE'S YOUR FINANCING COSTS UNDER THIS EXAMPLE IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND ON THIS EXAMPLE WITH ITS. TWENTY NINE THOUSAND HERE'S HOW MUCH YOU PAID EVERY DAY IF WHAT'S MOST SENSITIVE YOUR DAD WAS HOW MUCH HE HAD TO PUT OUT EVERY DAY. THIS ONE IT'S RETURN SEVENTY DOLLARS THAT ONE IS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE DOLLARS. AND SO YOU WORK DOWN THIS CHART AND THEN YOU SAY WELL WHAT IF I HAD TO PAY THIS OVER ONE YEAR THE APPLES AND APPLES. THIS IS A 10% COST AND THAT ONCE THE 6% COST BUT YOU GET A SENSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE JUST TWO DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF FLAT LOAN. VERSUS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GONNA PAY OFF EVERY DAY I'VE YOUR CASH REGISTER. AND THIS IS THE DILEMMA THAT THEY ALL FACE HOW DO YOU CREATE THE APPLES TO APPLES WITH THESE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS. AND THIS SHOWS YOU THAT YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS. WITH DIFFERENT LOAN AMOUNTS IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN COMPARE THE APPLES. TO IS THE ANNUALIZED COST OF CAPITAL IN BOTH BOTH CHARTS. THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET YOU AN APR AN ACC. THE GOING TO SHOW YOU THE A WHATEVER THE LAW REQUIRES WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE IN THIS IS A WAY FEET ACROSS COMPARISON SHOP THAT DOES EXIST TODAY OKAY [inaudible] SOME SORRY. SO I GET HOW YOU CAN COMPARE THE EAST. TALL IN I I APPLAUD WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I THINK THIS IS GOOD. MY CONCERN IS HOW DO YOU COMPARE THIS -- TO MY A BUSINESS CREDIT CARD OR SOMETHING IT'S GIVING ME JUST ANY PR. AT THE CAN. SMALL BUSINESSES USE CREDIT. VARIETY OF WAYS A MINUTE I GUESS YOU CAN SAY LOAN BUT I MEAN ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES. USE OF RIGHT I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT THAT LIKE ARE WE THIS MAKES VERY GOOD. FOR WHAT WERE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE AYE AYE BORROW MONEY TO WRITE AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT THE CREDIT CARD APR IT'S BASED ON HOW MUCH YOU PAY AND WHEN THAT WOULD THAT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE. BUT IT'S A CHANGING ESTIMATE EVERY MONTH IF YOU DECIDE TO ONLY PAY SO MUCH INTO PRINCIPLE. AT THAT'S GONNA CHANGE. THAT NUMBER AND SO THAT'S THE DILEMMA OF EVEN LOOKING AT THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT OF COUPLE OF I PUT THIS ON MY CREDIT CARD. VERSES TAKE GOTTA A A A BUSINESS LOAN IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING THING FOR ANYONE TO TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE A AND AND THAT'S WHY TO GO BACK TO THE SIMPLICITY IS THE ANNUAL COST. NOT AN AP ARE THAT THAT FLUCTUATES AND OBVIOUSLY SOME IN THE INDUSTRY SAY WE LOVE ITAND SOME SAY THEY HATE IT. AND WANTED IT CHANGED IN THE BILL. AND THAT WILL ALWAYS REMAIN THAT DILEMMA BUYER BEWARE WITH BUYER BEWARE LENDER BE WHERE. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GIVE THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ONE ADDITIONAL TOOL AND THAT'S NOT HOW MUCH IS THE MONEY GOING TO COST ME OR HOW MUCH I PAY EVERY DAY WHAT WITH THIS COSTA BY HEADED FOR TWELVE MONTHS WHY WOULDN'T YOU HAVE BALLS. WHAT WILL WE DO THE BILL DOES REQUIRED THAT -- THAT ALL THESE ELEMENTS NOT BE PROVIDED NO APR AN ACC WHY WOULDN'T YOU HAVE BOTH. WELL FIRST WE HAD THE CONCERN OF ON A P. R. ABOUT THE LEGAL JEOPARDY OF THAT NUMBER FLUCTUATING AND HOW CAN YOU HAVE IT BE A FAIR ESTIMATE. HOW DO THEY DO IT ON CREDIT CARDS I GET A CREDIT CARDS ARE I'M APPLYING FOR CREDIT CARD AND TELLS ME? THIS IS THE A PR AND THAT'S OUR IS ABOUT A STACK OF FEDERAL REGULATION THIS HIGH THAT WENT INTO. HI THAT HIGH PLUS MORE THAT GOT INTO THE WHOLE -- DETERMINATION OF A PR I AND WHEN YOU SAY IT'S IT YOU KNOW IT IT'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME IT'S BEEN HOTLY DEBATED. ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND SO YOU HAVE THIS BODY OF OF INFORMATION THAT'S NOW THERE THAT GUIDES COMPANIES AND HOW THEY HOW THEY DO AND HOW THEY CALCULATED. LET'S THESE COMPANIES COULD DO THAT. THEY COULD DO THAT TODAY AND MOST OF THEM DON'T -- I'M HAPPY HERE ONE THAT DOES PROVIDE IT BUT THE IT AGAIN IT'S THE WILD WEST OF SO WHY WOULDN'T WE WANT PEOPLE. I'M JUST I'M STILL BESIDES. I AM HAVING THERE'S A FUNCTION TO DO IT AND THEN THAT IT COULD BETTER CROSS COMPARE BETWEEN DIFFERENT PRODUCTS Y.. MEN'S MORE DISCLOSURE NOT LAUGHS YES SO WHY A I I I IN AYE I'M NOT LIKE SITTING NO I DON'T I HAVE NO IDEA I'M I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED ON TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN THIS BILL SO. YEAH WILL LOOK AT I'M OPEN MINDED THAT FOR ME THE ISSUE THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS. HOW DO WE PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL DISCLOSURE TO GET THAT SMALL BUSINESS PERSON A FIGHTING CHANCE? IN THE LENDING MARKET I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER A PROVIDING BOTH AND WHETHER THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL ARE LESS HELPFUL I'M OPEN MINDED TO IT. IT WAS REALLY TRYING TO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THIS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EFFORTS TO COMPLICATED AND THAT'S WHY HADN'T GONE IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I'M STILL OPEN MINDED ABOUT WHETHER THAT WE HAVE MORE HELP FULLER LESS. WHY WOULD SAY FOR A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND I THINK ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES MY COMMUNITY WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS A LOT NOT NATIVE SPEAKERS? BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT TWO DIFFERENT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS ONE THAT'S NOT MAYBE NOT SUPPOSE WE USE FOR SMALL BUSINESS LOANS BUT AS A CREDIT CARD VERSES THIS. THAT TO WIND UP THE LETTERS REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU GET TO THAT NUMBER WHAT IT MEANS THEN BUT WHY NOT THE LETTERS AND TRY TO GET TO SOME. COMPARISON WOULD BE HELPFUL ASSUMING THE LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE I THINK THAT. THAT EVEN IF IT WAS IN THERE -- HOME LANGUAGE. PROBABLY I MEAN IT'S BEYOND ME AND SIR MYSELF SLIGHTLY EDUCATED BUT I DEFINITELY WITH FOLKS WHO WHO ARE NEW TO THIS COUNTRY AND WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS ALL OUT A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THINK. THINK YOU AS A MEMBER STEINORTH -- FIRST I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY I THINK THIS IS VERY CLEVER -- I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND MY BUSINESS IS HELPING LOCAL AND SMALL BUSINESSES GROW AND I'VE BEEN DOING THAT SUCCESSFULLY I'VE PROBABLY HELPED OVER TEN THOUSAND BUSINESSES BE SUCCESSFUL. AND TO THE SINGLE GREATEST REASON FOR THEIR FAILURE IS UNDER CAPITALIZATION. PERIOD THAT'S IT AND SO SHORT TERM VERSUS LONGER TERM -- ACCESS TO CAPITAL I BELIEVE THAT YOUR WAY OF I'M REALLY TRYING TO ADD TO TRANSPARENCY TO THE SHORT TERM ACCESS TO CAPITAL SO PEOPLE HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST A BUSINESS. SKIN BE VERY USEFUL FOR THEIR SUCCESS SO I'LL BE VOTING YES ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. A SENATOR YOU KNOW I'VE HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AYE ANYTHING AND THE ANALYSIS DOES EXPRESS SOME CONCERN -- WITH THE ABILITY -- TO IN FORCE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO A WAY. TO ENSURE THAT YOUR OBJECTIVE IS MET. BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE [inaudible] AND BUT WE'VE ALSO HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THE BILL. AND KNOWING HOW IMPORTANT IT IS I'VE [inaudible] FOR ANY. YOU NO CONSUMER BUT TO HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS. WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT AT THIS POINT ON? APR YU'RE LUCKY IF YOU HAVE IT. AND SOME DO SOME DON'T IT'S NOT A STANDARDIZATION AND SO AS I LISTEN TO COLLEAGUES BRING ON THE CONCERNS FORWARD ABOUT HOW DO YOU COMPARE. ALL OF YOUR OPTIONS NOT JUST YOUR ONLINE LENDING BUT ALL OF YOUR OPTIONS AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT CURRENTLY THAT CAN EXIST BECAUSE IF THEY RIGHT NOW TWO DAY IF THEY WERE TO TRY TO GO TO AN ONLINE LOAN. I'M OR A CASH ADVANCE I AND ALSO COMPARE CREDIT CARDS THEY DON'T HAVE THE MECHANISM TO TO TO LOOK AT IT. AN APPLES TO APPLES I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS THAT AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT A TEMPORARY SOLUTION HAS A FOUR YEAR SUNSET SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND. I AM I STILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE OBJECTIVE IS GOING TO BE MET HOW WE KNOW THAT WHETHER IT'S ACC YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE. IS GOING TO BE MATT AND AND HOW WE'RE ENSURING THAT OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS AT POTENTIALLY ALL THE CONSUMERS AND OUR CUSTOMERS OF THIS PRODUCT I SEE THE SAME THING I'M NOT SURE. UP BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THEMES ON THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD. THEMES THAT I HAVE THE SENSITIVE TO THIS YEAR IN THE WORLD OF BANKING AND FINANCE AND THOSE INCLUDE THE IMPORTANCE FOR TRANSPARENCY. A FOR DISCLOSURE. AND FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE COST OF THE LOAN. I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS FOR THESE THINGS. UP ARE THESE ELEMENTS TO BE IN PLACE WITH A LOT OF PRODUCTS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU AN AYE VOTE IN AND IN GOOD FAITH -- AT THAT. WE CAN TRY TO GET THRE ON BUT I WILL NOTE THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME CONCERNS AND I'M HAPPY TO BE PART OF ANY KIND OF CONVERSATION TO REACH. UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OBJECTIVE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO IS ONE AND THAT IS ABLE TO BE MET -- AND I KNOW HOW HARD THIS WORK IS A AND UP WITH THAT IF THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS I THINK WE WILL. I HAVE YOU CLOSE AND THEN WILL TAKE ABOUT. YEAH I THINK YOU BETTER AND SHARON MEMBERS FOR THIS THOUGHTFUL AT A THOROUGH CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD TODAY APPRECIATE IT. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE AGAIN HOW HARD WE HAVE WORKED MY STAFF THAT YOUR STAFF AND OTHERS TO TRY. TO NARROW THE DIFFERENCES TAKE OUT LEASING TAKE OUT. AT SOME OF THE RECEIVABLES ISSUES THAT WE CAN'T REALLY FIT INTO THIS BOX SO THAT WE COULD PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT SIMPLE IN AN EASY AND UNDERSTANDABLE AND TRANSPARENT. I THINK WE'VE GOT A LONG WAYS HERE I KNOW THERE'S MORE WORK STILL TO BE DONE AND I'M HAPPY TO LOOK I LOOK FOR TO THAT WORK. THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER WE DO NEED TO PROTECT OUR SMALL BUSINESS. AND IT IS ALL WILD WEST OF FINANCING OUT THERE AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES GET US CLOSER TO THAT SPACE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] IT'S CULTURAL. THEY WANT AYE LIMON AYE CHEN CHEN I COSTA [inaudible] I BURKE [inaudible] GLORIA [inaudible] GABRIEL. CABLE I GONZALEZ FLETCHER.

TEN EIGHTY SEVEN AS YOU WELL KNOW PACE IS AN IMPORTANT THAT'S THE PROPERTY ASSESSED CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM IN OUR STATE IT'S ACCOMPLISHED A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO ACCOMPLISH A LOT MORE THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU PROPOSES SOME WHAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT CLEAN UP PROVISIONS TO LAST YEAR'S. A PACE MEASURES. I'LL HIGHLIGHT THREE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES FOR YOU FIRST THE BILL PROHIBITS HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTORS FROM COMMENCING HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTS. AND MAKE THOSE CONTRACTS UNENFORCEABLE IF. THE PROPERTY OWNER ENTERS INTO HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT BASED ON THE REASONABLE BELIEF THAT THE WORK WILL BE COVERED BY PACE. AND APPLIES FOR BUT IS NOT APPROVED FOR PACE FINANCING IN THE AMOUNT REQUESTED BY THE PROPERTY OWNER IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT PRICE. AND THE AMOUNT OF PAYS FINANCING APPROVED SECOND THE BILL INSURERS TRANSPARENCY REGARDING PLAYSPACE SOLICITORS AND PAY SOLICITOR AGENTS. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. IT GIVES THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TOOLS A TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THIRD THE BILL GIVES DB ó. THE ABILITY TO STEP IN AND TAKE IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION. IF TVO LEARNS TO PAY SOLICITOR OR SOLICITOR AGENT AND SELLING PAYS FINANCING IN A MANNER. THAT HARMS HOMEOWNERS THEN THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE BILL DOES IN ITS MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN A WITH THAT I'D AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME REQUEST. A RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I DON'T THINK YOU SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NIKKI MORE WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION HERE IN SUPPORT LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS TRANSPARENCY WITH RESPECT TO MISCONDUCT. MIST -- IF A THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRES DISCLOSURES IF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT TAKES CORRECTIVE ACTION. AND THAT THOSE ACTIONS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO OUGHT TO KNOW IF THERE COMMUNITY HAS A BAD ACTOR AYE AND IF THERE LOANS WERE I'M SUBJECT. TO WERE CONTROLLED BY THAT AGENT SO -- FOR THE TRANSPARENCY MEASURES WE RESPECTFULLY ASK MY FRIEND I'VE OF NOW MY FRIEND THAT'S KEY WITH THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD OR CSO BE FOR SHORT. ADD CSW IN SUPPORT OF TEN EIGHTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT INCREASES CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE SOLICITED INTO PASTE ASSESSMENT CONTRACTS BY PACE LISTENERS AND PACE WITH HER AGENTS. HARM SOLICITOR INFLICTING AGENTS WILL PRIMARILY BE C. SLB LICENTIATE. ARM UNDER CURRENT LOS YES WILL BE IS LIMITED BAVIER. THAT PACE -- APACE LOAN AYE ABSENT A CLEAR CASE OF MISREPRESENTATION OR FRAUD AYE WE BELIEVE THAT'S BECOME A SEVEN GOES A LONG WAY WITH THE UNDERWRITING REQUIREMENTS AND THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TOWARDS PROTECTIONS IN THE PACE INDUSTRY.

AND THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING COMPREHENSIVE REGULATIONS OVER THE PACE INDUSTRY SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY I'M WE HAVE SOME CAUTION WITH ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION WHILE THAT IS ONGOING. I'M I THINK WE'VE MADE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROGRESS UP PROGRESS THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE THAT THE DETAILS REALLY MATTER. I'M AND SO WERE I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR THAT WILL BE ABLE TO AND EFFECTIVELY THREAD THE NEEDLE TO MAKE SURE THAT PACE COULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE.

ON AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AT THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. LIMON I LIMON AYE CHEN. CHEN AYE ACOSTA. ACOSTA AYE BURKE. SEVEN SORRY GLORIA [inaudible] LAURIE HI [inaudible] GABRIEL [inaudible] GONZALEZ FLETCHER. DISSOLVES FLETCHER AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON HIGH STEINORTH STEINORTH I STONE [inaudible] WEBER [inaudible] WEBER I IRATE THE BILL IS THAT EACH WILL LEAVE IT OPEN AND FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON A MOVES OVER TO APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION HE SENATOR COULD. WILL GO AHEAD AND DO WHAT WE WILL HEAR -- SP EIGHT TWENTY SIX AND THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON FOR JOINING US WILL COULD THE ALMOST EVENING. A AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A SBA TWENTY SIX I REALLY LIKE THIS BILL I HAVE TO SAY YOU KNOW WE ALL. WE BROUGH BRING A LOT OF BILLS AND SUMMER KIND OF MORE EXCITING THAN OTHERS AND I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL IT IS A PROACTIVE. APPROACH TO REQUIRE MORE WOMEN DIRECTORS ON THE BOARDS OF PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS S. B. A TWENTY SIX CALIFORNIA WOMEN. MAKE UP 52% OF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA BUT ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE DIRECTORS OF OUR PUBLIC CORPORATIONS. I LOOK AT THE WOMEN AT THE STYLUS AND I KNOW THAT EACH ONE OF YOU. IS QUALIFIED TO SERVE IN THAT CAPACITY AS WELL AS THE CAPACITY HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND THAT INCLUDES NONPROFIT BOARDS AS WELL. SO MORE THAN 80% OF THE STATE'S CORPORATIONS ARE OPERATING WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE EXPERIENCE PERSPECTIVE AND TOOLS THAT WOMEN BRING WITH THEM TO THE CORPORATE SETTING. AND THE LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT WOMEN HAVE THAT ENHANCE. THE RESULTS OF CORPORATIONS BECAUSE RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS THAT BOARDS WITH WOMEN MEMBERS PERFORM BETTER IN THE MARKETPLACE. BY HAVING SUCH LOW PARTICIPATION RATES FOR WOMEN IN ARE KEPT OUR CORPORATE LEADERSHIP RANKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE EFFECTIVELY INHIBIT OUR OWN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IS A STATE. OTHER NATIONS HAVE PREVIOUSLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS AND ACTUALLY REQUIRE A PERCENTAGE OF BOARD MEMBERS TO BE FEMALE THAT'S REPRESENTING THE EXPERIENCE EXPERTISE AND WISDOM OF HALF THE POPULATION. WHICH ALSO REPRESENTS 70% OF ALL THE CONSUMERS. THIS MEASURE TAKES A BIG STEP TOWARD CLOSING THIS GENDER GAP. IT INCREASES GENDER DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS BY REQUIRING EACH PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATION HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE WOMAN ON ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND BEGINNING IN JULY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE BILL WILL REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF TWO WOMEN DIRECTORS ON BOARDS WHERE THERE ARE FIVE DIRECTORS AND AT LEAST THREE WOMEN ON BOARDS WHERE THERE ARE SIX OR MORE DIRECTORS. AND AS I MENTIONED THE RESEARCH ON THIS IS CLEAR. THOSE ARE TWENTY SIXTEEN MACKENZIE SURE CONSULTING FIRM A BUSINESS CONSULTING FIRM VERY HIGHLY REGARDED THE DID A STUDY REVEALED THAT NATIONWIDE THE COMPANIES WHERE WOMEN ARE MOST STRONGLY REPRESENTED AT BORDER TOP MANAGEMENT LEVELS. ARE ALSO BUSINESSES THAT PERFORMED THE BEST. IN PROFITABILITY PRODUCTIVITY INNOVATION GOVERNANCE BETTER PERFORMANCE AND WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK? SO -- THIS A STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT IN COMPANIES WHERE THERE WERE THREE OR MORE WOMEN CREATING SORT OF THAT CRITICAL MASS THAT WE TALK ABOUT. SENIOR MANAGEMENT ABOUT WHAT WERE THEY THREE MORE WOMEN IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT POSITIONS THEY SCORED HIGHER ON AVERAGE ON THE ORGANIZATION PERFORMANCE PROFILE. THAN COMPANIES WITH NO WOMEN ON BOARDS OR IN THE EXECUTIVE RANKS WOMEN MAKE BUSINESSES MORE PROFITABLE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND BETTER. SO I AUTHORED A RESOLUTION ON THIS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SCR A SIXTY TWO THAT URGED. URGED OUR BOARDS AND A THE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES THAT -- ARE PUBLICLY TRADED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN ON THEIR BOARDS TWO ONE TWO AND THREE DEPENDING UPON THE SIZE OF THE BOARDS IT WE IT WAS A PRETTY PLEASE. BUT THE PRETTY PLEASED AND GET US ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT THAT THE THERE WAS NO UPTICK WHATSOEVER AS A RESULT OF THAT. AND CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE IN THE UNITED STATES TO ADOPT THIS TYPE OF RESOLUTION WHICH WAS AGAIN OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED. BUT AND FIVE OTHER STATES HAVE PASSED SIMILAR MEASURES BUT BY THE END OF TWENTY SIXTEEN FEWER THAN 20%. OF THE RUSSELL THREE THOUSAND COMPANIES ARE HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA HAD THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF WOMEN DIRECTORS CALLED FOR IN THE RESOLUTION. WE'VE GOT. TO BASICALLY MOVE THAT ENVELOPE MOVE THAT TICK UPWARD SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OUR CORPORATE -- STRUCTURE OF FOR THE BETTERMENT OF PEOPLE WORKING THESE COMPANIES AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. IF IN THE MIRAMAX COMPANY OR THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY AS IT BECAME IF THERE HAD BEEN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF WOMEN ON THAT BOARD HARVEY WEINSTEIN WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR HE WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH -- CONDONED BY THAT BOARD FOR AS MANY YEARS AS HE DID WOMEN ADD VALUE. AND WITH THAT I WOULD TO A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE JOINING ME TODAY. ANNA LISA PARA TWO IS A CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF FINANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF BUSINESS. SHE TEACHES GRADUATE COURSES IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND UNDERGRADUATE COURSES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND PERSONAL FINANCE. AND MY GOOD FRIEND BETSY BURKE KOMMER HRIDAYA WHO IS THE CEO OF BURKE FROM A BURKE AMER CLAYTON RETAINED EXECUTIVE SEARCH COMPANY IN LOS ANGELES. AND CEO OF THE NATIONAL. TWENTY TWENTY WOMEN ON BOARDS A RESEARCH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO ACHIEVE 20% A PUBLIC COMPANY BOARD SEATS HELD BY WOMEN OF ALL ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS. BY A BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY SHE'S ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK THE BOARD GAME AND PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA'S NOVEL -- IN WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK AT THAT -- LADIES THANK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU AND I WILL ASK FOR BREVITY AND JUST AS WE ARE AT IN THE EVENING PORTIONS OF OUR DAY SO THANK YOU. WE BROUGHT A LITTLE PARTY FAVORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT COULD MAKE IT MORE HER. MACON AFTERNOON EVENING OF IT I'M BETSY BURKE AMER CRITTER THANK YOU SENATOR FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THIS REMARKABLE BILL. AND I'M HERE TO EXPLAIN BRIEFLY OF WHAT HAPPENS IN -- EXECUTIVE SEARCH I'VE OWNED IT EXECUTIVE SEARCH FIRM FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND OF HANDLED MANY BOARD SEARCHES AND TO EXPLAIN WHY THERE ARE NOT MORE WOMEN ON BOARD CURRENTLY WHY DOESN'T THIS JUST HAPPEN ORGANICALLY. AND IT'S BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS OF MEN UNDERSTANDABLY SO -- OVER THE YEARS DECADES OF COMPANIES OF OUR CEOS HAVE WANTED OTHER CEOS TO BE ON THEIR ADVISORY BOARDS ON THEIR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS TO ADVISE THEM HOW TO BE A CEO AND THAT'S WHAT THE BOARD DOES. IS TO HIRE AND FIRE THE C. E. O. ADVISE THE STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY AND TO GUIDE THE COMPENSATION OF THE CEO AND THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT. SO TRADITIONALLY OF THEY'VE ALL. MEMBERS AND THAT PRIMARILY IS ANGLO MEANT. AND WITH THAT O. WHEN THE IT HAS EVOLVED THAT -- MORE SHAREHOLDERS ARE INSISTING THAT OTHER TALENTS BE BROUGHT ON OTHER EXPERIENCE AT A IN NOW ON BOARD ROOMS BECAUSE OF SO MANY OTHER -- IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT COMPANIES HAVE TO FACE ON BEHALF OF THE SHAREHOLDERS LIKE A CYBERSECURITY AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE TECHNOLOGY IT'S SET FOR OF THAT WOMEN CAN BRING TO THE BOARD. NOW THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WOULD CONSIDER WOMEN HOWEVER WHEN BOARD MEMBERS THAT WHEN THE BOARD HIRE US TO DO A SEARCH THEY SAY BETSY BRING US A WOMAN. WITH A REALLY ONE A WOMAN BUT WILL GOTTA HAVE ONE BECAUSE THE SHAREHOLDERS WHAT WHAT AND I I'VE HEARD THIS. AND WE JUST LAUGHED AT THAT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN CONTINUE ON BUT SEARCH BUT THEY SAY OF BRING US ONE WHO DOESN'T TALK TOO MUCH AND DOESN'T DISRUPT TOO MUCH. SO THERE'S AN AUTOMATIC FEELING THAT WOMEN ARE A BRING -- THE IT'S IT'S AND IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A EVIDENT BIAS BUT IT'S A INHERENT BIAS THAT WOMEN CHANGES THE DYNAMIC OF THE BOARD. SO IT'S CHALLENGING TO AT LEAST TO HAVE WOMEN WHO. A CAN BE BOARD MEMBERS FROM THE BOARD MEMBERS WILL ACCEPT SO. BUT WITH MUCH MORE EFFORT TO GET THAT DONE WE CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME BY REQUIRING. THAT EACH PUBLIC COMPANY BOARD PUT ON AT LEAST ONE WOMAN IN THE NEXT YEAR. AND THEY'RE ONE FOURTH OF ALL PUBLIC COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NO WOMEN ON THEIR BOARDS ONE FOURTH WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT NUMBER AND BEEN FAR OUT WEIGH US IN TERMS OF NUMBERS. THAT THEY'RE THREE THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED MEN ON CORPORATE BOARDS IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COMPANIES COMPARED TO FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE WOMEN. SO THERE'S A HUGE DISPARITY AND WHEN THOSE MEN ARE ASKED WHAT WOMEN YOU KNOW OUR WAY TO GET WHAT WOMEN YOU KNOW WHO COULD COME ONTO OUR BOARD. OF THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD CAN ASSURE YOU THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT STORIES OF WOMEN IN THIS BOOK OF MY BOOK YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT HOWEVER. HER HIT BUT IT TALKS ABOUT HOW THE WOMEN ONLY GOT ON TO CORPORATE BOARDS BECAUSE THEY KNEW SOMEONE ON THAT BOARD AND WERE ENDORSED FOR MEMBERSHIP ON THAT BOARD AND THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET WOMEN KNOWN. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN OVER THE MICROPHONE TO AND LISA BARRETT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR OUR RESEARCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT THE END THANK YOU SENATOR. AND MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY. MY NAME DALY SAID THERE IT AND AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED I'M A CLINICAL PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO. HOUSE SO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON BOARD OF DIRECT WORDS OF DIRECTORS AND I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THIS FIELD ADVISING BOARDS AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. ONBOARD EFFECTIVENESS AND BOARD COMPOSITION FOR TWENTY YEARS. AND I DID A STUDY LOOKING OUT THE CALIFORNIA BOARD MEMBERS THE CALIFORNIA BOARDS TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF WOMEN IN COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND HAS BEEN NOTED THAT I'M UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA -- IS ACTUALLY EVEN BEHIND THE NATIONAL PERCENTAGES WHEN IT COMES TO PREVALENCE OF WOMEN DIRECTORS AMONG. AND THE PEOPLE SERVING ON CORPORATE BOARDS OF COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE A LITTLE OVER 15%. WHEREAS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AT QUARTER OF THE COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HAD NO WOMEN ON THEIR BOARDS AND IN FACT WHEN LOOKING AT THAT BY REGION WE SEE UNFORTUNATELY THAT MY HOMETOWN OF SAN DIEGO. IS AND IS THE WORST TO HIT WHEN IT COMES TO AND THE PREVALENCE OF COMPANIES WITH NO FEMALE DIRECTORS 40% OF THE COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED IN. SAN DIEGO HAD NO WOMEN ON THE BOARDS. SO -- I JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW TWO THINGS BRIEFLY PLEASE AND ONE IS AT THE ISSUES REGARDING THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES FOR BOARD SERVICE. THERE ARE -- THERE MAY BE CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE. SERVE ON CORPORATE BOARDS AND IN FACT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. AND BETSY IS THE CEO OF ORGANIZATION AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEN FACT AROUND THE WORLD. THAT AND HAVE MEMBERS WHO ARE AND SEEKING CORPORATE BOARDS SERVICE AND WOMEN DIRECTORS I AM. CURRENTLY SITTING ON CORPORATE BOARDS AND THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING TO SERVE ON CORPORATE BOARDS WHO ARE EMINENTLY QUALIFIED TO DO SO. AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ALSO ABOUT AND INDIVIDUAL WOMEN SERVING ON TOO MANY BOARDS AND IF THIS LAW WERE TO BE PASSED IN FACT I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT. THE FACT THAT THERE IS A MECHANISM TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN THAT IS IN PLACE ALREADY. AND THERE MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL SERVING ON TOO MANY BOARDS HOWEVER THE INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDERS VOTE AGAINST DIRECTORS WHO ARE SERVING ON TOO MANY BOARDS. SO BOARDS WOULD NOT ALLOW THEIR MEMBERS TO SERVE ON MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR CORPORATE BOARD SO THIS WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR THE WOMEN WHO ARE BROUGHT IN TO SERVE ON BOARDS HEARING CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN THE FLY IT LIES PUT INTO PLACE AND ANOTHER ISSUES REGARDING DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME HALL ON THE NOT GO INTO THE DETAILS DESCRIBING HOW DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND SAT. A BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT IT IF INDEED THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR YOU. AND LIKEWISE I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE PREVALENCE OUR STATISTICS REGARDING. AND THE COMPOSITION OF CORPORATE BOARDS AND TO THE EXTENT YOU HAVE IT WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. AND IT WILL USUALLY LIMITED TO TWO SO I JUST I I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S TWO OTHER PEOPLE SAID THERE'S FOUR OF YOU THERE SO.

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE AT LARGE COMPANIES MY COUSIN ONLY ONS FIREMAN'S FUND -- THAT I'M AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE STATE BAR I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY AND I CHAU WOMEN OR 47% OF OUR LABOR FORCE. THEY'RE ONLY 16% OF WOMEN THAT ARE REPRESENTED ON PORTS AND I REALLY FEEL THAT CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS ARE DISADVANTAGED. BY THIS LACK OF GENDER DIVERSITY AND IT'S A REALLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD. IN THIS AREA -- AND CREATE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR OUR BUSINESSES GREAT STATE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY OTHER.

I'M AND STAINS MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I REPRESENT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I AM ALSO A WOMAN BUSINESS OWNER MYSELF.

HI MAUREEN LANE NAM OWNER OF OUR OUR STRATEGIES A CONSULTING FIRM IN SACRAMENTO AND I'M ON THE BOARD OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND I WILL ASK AND THAT WE MAKE ROOM. FOR THE OPPOSITION [inaudible] ONE GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSED SB. TWENTY SIX I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE POLICY I DON'T DISAGREE WITH HAVING MORE WOMEN ON BOARDS -- I WOULD AT SOME POINT LEAD TO SERVE ON A BOARD MYSELF BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT THE WAY IN WHICH THEY'RE GOING THAT PROPOSAL'S GOING ABOUT DOING IT -- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND JUST AYE JEOPARDIZES OUR DAY FIRST EAGLES AND OTHER POTENTIAL AREAS SO THE BE A BILL BASICALLY REQUIRES A MINIMUM QUOTA. OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WOMEN ON A BOARD AND WHILE A LOT OF OUR CORPORATION CERTAINLY -- STRIVE AND ARE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE HAVING WOMEN ON THE BOARD THERE ALSO TRYING TO DIVERSIFY THEIR BOARD POSITIONS IN MORE THAN JUST WITH REGARDS TO GENDER. AND SO IF YOU HAVE A TO POLICY -- EQUALLY QUALIFIED ONE MAY SATISFY ANOTHER DIVERSITY -- CONCERN OR ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE CORPORATION OTHER THAN JUST GENDER AND YOU SPECIFICALLY SAY IN THIS BILL THAT YOU HAVE TO SATISFY MINIMUM QUOTA WITH REGARDS TO GENDER YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED OTHER CANDIDATES THAT MAY SERVE OTHER DIVERSITY PRACTICES FOR THE CORPORATION. OTHER THAN JUST GENDERS WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT US PER. EXPECTED AS WELL I'M WILL THOUGH ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH REGARDS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY WE HAVE AN EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE AND OUR FEDERAL CONSTITUTION WE HAVE A A CAN. OF SIMILAR EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE UNDER A CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE ONE SECTION EIGHT SAYS THAT NO PERSON CAN BE DISQUALIFIED FROM A PROFESSIONAL VOCATION BASED UPON A LISTA PROTECT CLASSIFICATIONS INCLUDING GENDER AND AGAIN. IF IT YOU GOT TO QUALIFIED CANDIDATES ONE THAT IS MALE ONE THAT IS FEMALE AND UNDER THIS BILL YOU SPECIFICALLY HAVE TO HIRE SOMEBODY TO SATISFY THE QUOTA YOU'RE MAKING A DISQUALIFICATION SPECIFICALLY BASED UPON GENDER WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION. SECONDLY OUR THIRD LEAVE -- THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE WITH REGARD STICK OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOCTOR AND FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS STOCKTON TRIES TO PREVENT CONFLICT OF LAWS BETWEEN DIFFERENT STATES AND THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOCTRINE SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT THE LAW IN WHICH THE A CORPORATION IS. A INCORPORATED WILL DICTATE THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS MEANING THE VOTING OF THEIR DIRECTORS HOW THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS GOVERNED ECCENTRIC BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T WANT. A DIFFERENT STATES FROM WHERE THAT BUSINESSES LOW DISTANCE STANDARDS WITH REGARDS TO THOSE INTERNAL AFFAIRS. THE BILL IS NOT APPLICABLE TO ONLY THE COMPANIES THAT ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN CALIFORNIA IS APPLICABLE TO THOSE ON COMPANIES THAT ARE BASICALLY HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH REGARDS TO THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOCTRINE. WHICH WILL LEAVE IS ANOTHER ON CHALLENGE FOR THE LEGALITY OF IT SO AGAIN WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE IDEA OF THE BILL TO ENCOURAGE MORE WOMEN ON THESE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH IS FILLED THE WAY IN WHICH THE PROPOSAL IS GOING. IS BOTH UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND WILL BE LEGALLY CHALLENGED INTO THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOCTOR AS WELL FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE TO STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION ROSS BUCKLEY WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION POSTS THE MEASURE. THERE THOMAS OF HALF BACK COME IN OPPOSITION. MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS EIGHT DO WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING THAT THIS. IS THE JURISDICTION OF THIS BANKING COMMITTEE OVERSEES CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ANYTHING RELATED TO THE CONSTITUTION CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS BILL WILL BE DEALT WITH IN JUDICIARY. SIRA GONZALEZ FLETCHER I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORTH DO THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND JUDICIARY I'M. I HOPE IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL -- BUT I JUST WANNA KNOW BECAUSE I I DO FIND IT A LITTLE OFFENSIVE -- TO BE LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION -- THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SATISFIED BEING BOTH GENDER AND RACIALLY DIVERSE SO AM I DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED. TO TO SUGGEST THAT IT IS A DISCUSSION BETWEEN MEN OF COLOR AND WHITE WOMEN SO THAT WAS PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE TO ME -- SO WITH THAT I THINK IS OUR MOTION IF NOT I'LL BE HAPPY MAKE MISSION. TO BE AT THE SECOND AFFECTED THANK YOU. ARE RATES AND THEN WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CHEN THAT SUMMER GRAYSON. SENATE JACKSON AND I DO APPRECIATE BRING THIS INFORMATION CONTINUE TO LIGHT AND I'VE BEEN REALLY BLESSED TO WORK WITH THE WOMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HERE THAT HAVE EDUCATED ME GUIDED ME THROUGH THE PROCESS AND ALSO HAVE A TEAM. OF A WOMEN OVER 60% ON MY TEAM THAT'S A ARE HARD WORKING DILIGENT. AND I NOTICED THAT. YOU WERE JERSEY SCRIPTING WAY WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS BILL AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR IT. AND I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT. IN TERMS OF AND FOR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THAT THE BILL A CUP. THE BILL THAT THE SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM WITH CHOOSING A WOMAN OVER MAN ON THE BOARD IS A FALSE -- ANALOGY BECAUSE WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT CALLS FOR THE ADDITION. OF A POSITION ON THE BOARD SO WE'RE NOT KICKING ANYBODY OFF TO PUT A WOMAN ON I IF THE COMPANY AND IN PART THE PROBLEM TOO IS THAT. THE TURNOVER RATE UNEASE PLUM POSITIONS IS VERY LIMITED AND THE IT SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS SAY LOOK IF THERE HASN'T BEEN AN OPENING -- ANNA OF YOU DON'T HAVE A WOMAN ON THE BOARD BY TWENTY NINETEEN YOU AT A POSITION TO ABORT. AND THAT POSITION WE SHOULD FIND THE BEST QUALIFIED PERSON AND I KINDA GET A LITTLE INSULTED TO WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT -- YOU KNOW IF IT'S A QUALIFIED. MAN IN A QUALIFIED WOMAN IN YOU GIVE THE POSITION THE WOMAN THEN YOU'RE TAKING AWAY FROM US BUT PROBABLY MORE QUALIFIED MAN. MEAN THE PROBLEM WE'VE HAD IS THAT FOR DECADES AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS THIS IT THE ONLY PEOPLE OR DETERMINE TO BE QUALIFIED BEEN MEN. OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE I MEAN THE NOTION THAT 40%. OF THE CORPORATIONS A IN IN CALIFORNIA BELIEVE WAS DON'T HAVE ANY WOMEN ON THE BOARDS WHY WHY IS THAT BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN THIS SORT OF BLANKET DISCRIMINATION SO RATHER THAN PLAY THAT GAME. WERE SAYING OKAY YOU CAN KEEP YOUR BOARD THE WAY IT IS WHICH IS GOING TO ADD A POSITION AND WE NEED TO ADD WOMEN FIND. AND I WILL TELL YOU THERE ARE SOME INCREDIBLY. THAT STANFORD ACTUALLY HAS IT'S A BUSINESS SCHOOL HAS ITS OWN REGISTRY THE HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL HAS ITS OWN REGISTRY OF WOMEN A QUALIFIED WOMEN I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THESE REGISTRIES. THESE PEOPLE WILL CERTAINLY QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES BUT THEN AGAIN I WILL GO INTO THAT BUT BUT IT RIGHT. YOU SAID IT NOT ME BUT BUT THE POINT IS THE POINT IS THAT THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY QUALIFY PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE AND IN GREAT MEASURE BECAUSE AS WAS POINTED OUT THIS HAS BEEN SORT OF A WHITE MAN'S BASTION FOR YEARS. AND SO BASICALLY I I WAS JUST WRITING DOWN THE YOU KNOW THERE ARE A FEW ISSUES AND THEY WILL BE TAKEN UP WE ADDRESS SOME OF MY OWN -- SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND I THINK ONCE WE ONCE WE OPEN THOSE. DOORS WE WILL FIND THAT NOT ONLY WILL WE HAVE MORE WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR AND WE WILL HAVE PEOPLE OF COLOR BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE. A AB BASICALLY TAKEN THE CHALLENGE OF FINDING THE BEST QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THESE POSITIONS IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR GENDER IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION PERSPECTIVE OR OF THEIR OF REYES SORT. I MEAN THAT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS WE HAVE HAD A GLASS CEILING AND A CEILING THAT HAS BEEN. A TO A PLACE WITH THAT THE THERE'S NO DOOR EXCEPT FOR WHITE MEN. THAT'S BEEN THE PROBLEM AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS SAYING OKAY GUYS YOU HAVE YOUR YOU HAVE YOUR C. SUITE BUT WE'RE GOING TO JUST ADD A POSITION AND ADD A WOMAN TO THAT. AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU WITH IT IN A COURSE OF A VERY SPORTS WILL LOOK LIKE THE FACE OF CALIFORNIA AND NOT THE FACE OF THE AUGUSTA. GOLF CLUB. A IS THAT WHAT IT IS THEY ARE THINGS I WOULD THINK YEAH SENATOR I KNOW ACTUALLY WHAT WE WILL HOLD OFF THAT WAS ADDRESSED TO THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR TAXPAYER YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I WAS RAISED FOR THE VERY STRONG MOTHER WHO LET ME KNOW VERY CLEAR. THAT -- I WAS TO HONOR AND OBEY HER AND SHE HAD THE SHE HAD THE RIGHT TO ADD TAKE ME OUT AND THAT WAS NOT ON A DATE. A AND THE LITTLE AND A WOMAN -- YES AND SO I I WOULD DARE NOT -- STAND AGAINST THIS NOR -- NOT SUPPORTED IN FEAR THAT SHE WOULD VISIT ME TONIGHT FROM HER GRAVE. A HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT AND AGAIN I DO APPRECIATE IT I HAVE NOTICED OR OR I EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT JUST A LITTLE TESTIMONY POSSIBLY. TO HAVE BE ENCOURAGING AND AND I WAS DOING A TOWN HALL AWHILE BACK. AND THE SUBJECT HAD COME UP OF EQUITY AND AND AS A GENDER EQUITY. AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR AND ONE FEMALE SPEAKER GOT UP AND SAID SOMETHING REALLY PROFOUND SHE SAID WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR YOU MEN TO LEAVE THE ROOM. WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR YOU TO MAKE ROOM IN. AND I THAT REALLY RESONATED WITH REALLY REALLY WELL WITH AND AND STUCK WITH ME EVEN TO THIS DAY. AND OUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND THAT IS I I HEARD YOUR RESPONSE TO CONSTITUTION THAT OF THE AND I UNDERSTAND JUDICIOUS GONNA TAKE THAT UP TOMORROW. HOWEVER WHEN YOU DO AT ON THAT SEAT AND THEN THAT SEAT WOULD BE VACATED BY A FEMALE AT THAT POINT DO YOU ENTER INTO THE CHALLENGE THAT WERE FACING NOW WITH POSSIBLY A QUOTA OR AT HOW WOULD. A HOW WOULD THAT WORK VENN ONCE THE SEATS ALREADY BEEN CREATED AND OCCUPIED AND THEN VACATED. THEN YOU SPECIFICALLY ONLY LOOK FOR THAT ONE GENDER. I'D DOES THAT CREATE A PROBLEM OR ARE WE OKAYED BY THAT POINT WELL I YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THIS WE ARE BASICALLY SAYING THAT WE WANT TO HAVE. A CERTAIN EQUAL REPRESENTATION ON THESE BOARDS. ARM AND YOU KNOW I SUSPECT I SUSPECT THERE WILL BE A CHALLENGE NO MATTER WHAT WE DO BUT I THINK. A I THINK WE HAVE ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM AS BEST WE CAN WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. OKAY IT MAY ULTIMATELY TURN OUT THAT YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS WHAT THE SUPREME COURT'S GONNA DO ONE ANY GIVEN DAY. BUT MY HOPE IS BY THEN WE'VE BROKEN THE LOGJAM AND WHICH TO START LOOKING FOR THE BEST PEOPLE FOR THE JOB I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] A REP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CENTER FOR BRING THIS BEFORE I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA I'M LOOKING FOR TO SUPPORTING AND I THINK I'M.
