00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.620
MINOR CHANGES TO BE CONSISTENT

PRESENTATIONS ON THE SENATE THIS

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:13.179
IS A RARE OCCASION FOR ME BUT I

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.248
WILL OPPOSE THESE RULE CHANGES.

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:16.916
IN MANY WAYS OVER THE LAST

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:20.553
SEVERAL YEARS. WE HAVE SEEN

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.255
DELIBERATE ACTIONS OF THE

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:25.091
LEGISLATURE TO DIMINISH PUBLIC

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.493
INPUT IN THE PROCESS. ALTHOUGH

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.696
MOST EGREGIOUS IS THE PUBLIC

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:32.999
COMMENT WHICH IS VIRTUALLY A

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.401
JOKE. PEOPLE GET THE CALL IN AND

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:38.571
SAY I'M JANE I LIKE IT- BILL AND

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:41.674
I DON'T THAT'S NOT PUBLIC INPUT

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.110
. MANY OTHER THINGS AS WELL. I'M

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.179
PLEASED THAT WE ARE GOING TO

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.014
HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THIS

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.183
YEAR WE CAN HIT ROCK BOTTOM BUT

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.150
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CONFERENCE

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:54.854
COMMITTEE BEFORE FOR A YEAR TO.

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:58.491
BUT I THINK IT'S UNWIELDY. I

00:05:58.558 --> 00:05:59.992
DON'T NECESSARILY THINK IT'S

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.528
GOING TO BE HELPFUL. IT SHOULD

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:05.331
BE CONFINED TO THE DIFFERENCES.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:08.668
IN THE TWO SEPARATE VERSIONS OF

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:12.538
THE BUDGET. NOT NECESSARILY A

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:16.476
FREE FOR ALL. EVEN NASH

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.611
STRUCTURALLY HOW THE BUILDING

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:21.814
WORKS NOW. THE CITIZENS HAVE

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.716
LESSER INPUT. INDEED THIS

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:27.120
INSTITUTION. I THINK SOME OF IT

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.455
MAY WELL BE BY DESIGN I DO NOT

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:31.824
ACCUSE NOT NECESSARILY THESE

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.460
RULES ARE SUCH AN EXERCISE. BUT

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:36.763
TO STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:38.731
THEN JUST STEP THAT MAKES THE

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:42.568
SENATE. MUCH MORE CAN. THE

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:43.636
CONDUCT AN OPERATION OF THE

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:46.205
ASSEMBLY. AND THAT'S BEEN A

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:48.241
SIGNIFICANT BOON OVER THE

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:52.345
DECADES IN THIS INSTITUTION.

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:54.347
WE'VE HAD SENATE RULES WITHOUT

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:56.716
ASSEMBLY RULES. WE HAVE

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:57.850
SOMETHING HERE THOUGH THAT'S

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.519
DIFFERENT THAT'S BEEN SENATORIAL

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:03.289
COURTESY. THAT'S BEEN SOMEWHAT

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:08.661
PRESERVED. MY LAST DAY HERE I

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.663
MAY SAY A WORD ABOUT THIS AGAIN

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.998
. I WAS HERE TWELVE YEARS AND

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:14.467
GONE EIGHTEEN AND I CAME BACK

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:15.568
AND PEOPLE SAY JIM WHAT'S

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:17.136
DIFFERENT. WELL I SAID IT'S

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:19.739
SOCIETAL IT IS NOT JUST. IN THE

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:24.577
LEGISLATURE. BUT RESPECT FOR

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:27.513
EACH OTHER AND RESPECT FOR THE

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.382
INSTITUTION AND ITS RULES HAVE

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:31.551
GREATLY DIMINISHED. I BEMOAN

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:35.421
THAT AND IN PART BECAUSE OF THAT

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.390
I WILL VOTE NO ON THESE RULES.

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:38.791

FIFTEEN MONTHS INTO THE SESSION

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:02.048

A NEGOTIATION WITH THE ASSEMBLY

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.166
THERE WERE SOME OUTSTANDING

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.802
ISSUES. ARE THAT WE WERE TRYING

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:23.903

THE- SENATE. WE NEGOTIATED- AT

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:34.914
SOME POINT- WE REALIZE THAT WE

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:36.616
SHOULD HAVE THE RULES IN PLACE

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:39.151
WHILE WE DO HAVE SENATE RULES-

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:41.187
WE NOW HAVE A SECOND BUILDING-

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:43.322
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE. THE

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:44.524
ASSEMBLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.260

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.802
NOT TO GET THEM DONE THERE WAS A

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.137
CONTINUED EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.106
NEGOTIATE ON SOME ITEMS THAT WE

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:03.309
FELT ARE I FELT. AND WE FELT

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:07.647
WOULD GIVE THE SENATE- MAYBE-

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.715
I'M SURE IT DIPLOMATICALLY LET

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:11.584
ME SAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE OUR

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.220
BALANCE IN TERMS OF THOSE SORTS

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.922
OF THINGS IF YOU SERVE ON THE

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.757
RULES COMMITTEE. AND A NUMBER OF

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.091
MEMBERS IN THIS HOUSE SERVE ON

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:20.826
THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE YOU

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.028
KNOW THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT WE

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.562
ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE BETWEEN THE

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.698
HOUSES. AND SO THE ADDITIONAL

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.700
TIME WE TOOK ASIDE FROM THE FACT

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.902
THAT WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC AND WE

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:32.071
PASSED RULS OF THE SENATE. THAT

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.339
REFLECTED SOME EMERGENCY

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.341
MEASURES THAT WE NEEDED TO TAKE

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.610
AND BE ABLE TO PIVOT AND MEET

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:39.412
THE NEEDS OF THE SENATE. WE

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:40.813
REALLY WANTED TO PUSH AND TRY TO

GET SOME MORE AGREEMENTS WITH

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:44.083
THE ASSEMBLY ON OTHER THINGS BUT

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.886
AT THIS POINT- IT WOULD BE GOOD

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:48.688
FOR US TO HAVE JOINT RULES SO.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.623
WE DIDN'T RUSH BECAUSE WE WERE

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.924
TRYING TO GET MORE THINGS DONE

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:53.893
BUT WE WERE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.828
A PANDEMIC AND WE STILL ARE WE

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:57.797

00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:00.700
