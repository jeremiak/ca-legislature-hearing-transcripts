AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. COURSE THREE ONE KNOWS WHY WE'RE HERE HI THIS PAST OCTOBER WITH FORECASTS OF FOUR HI OFFSHORE WINDS. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WERE LEFT IN THE DARK AS THE STATE'S THREE LARGEST ELECTRIC UTILITIES PROACTIVELY SHUT OFF POWER TO NUMEROUS CIRCUITS ON THEIR GRITS. PLEASE SHUT OFFS WERE USED AS A TOOL TO PREVENT THE UTILITIES EQUIPMENT FROM IGNITING WILDFIRES. AFTER IT IN THE IN THE PAST TWO YEARS SOME OF THE MOST DEADLY FIRES. IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY WERE IGNITED BY UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING NORTH BAY FIRES A TWENTY SEVENTEEN THOMAS FIRE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF COURSE THE VERY DEADLY CAMPFIRE. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IN AN EFFORT TO STYMIE UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE FROM FOR SPARKING FIRES IN JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AUTHORIZED PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. TO UTILIZE POWER SHUT OFF PROGRAMS AND RELATED PRO PROTOCOLS ALREADY IN USE IN IN PLACES LIKE SAN DIEGO. BY SEND YOU GAS AND ELECTRIC. BOB FOLLOWING OF FIRES THAT THE. THE AREA IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN PREVIOUS YEARS AS A AS A RESULT WE ARE WITNESSING AN EXPANSION AND GROWTH THESE POWER SHUT OFFS WHEN CONDITIONS ARE DRY AND WINDS ARE HIGH AND THERE'S BEEN AN ENORMOUS EXPANSION ACTUALLY. NOW POINT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS THESE SHUT OFF TO CREATE THEIR OWN CHALLENGES AS COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS ARE LEFT WITHOUT POWER AS WILL LEARN TODAY THE IMPACTS OF THE POWER SHUT OFFS WERE WIDE RANGING AND CREATED NUMEROUS HARDSHIPS AND NUMEROUS SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED RESIDENTS FOOD SPOILED THE- MEDICAL. MEDICALLY VULNERABLE WHO RELY ON ELECTRICITY OF TO STAY ALIVE IN MANY CASES HAD TO FIND WAYS TO MAINTAIN THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. AND MANY OTHER IMPACTS WILL ALSO DISCUSS OUTAGES IMPACTING TELECOMMUNICATIONS WHICH OCCURRED. EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE POWER STAYED ON. AND LIMITED CALIFORNIANS ABILITY TO CALL NINE ONE ONE AND RECEIVE NO. EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS AND- JUST PLAINLY- THEY WERE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND CONDUCTOR DAILY LIVES. TODAY'S HEARING IS INTENDED TO LAOS TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MITIGATE ALL THE RISK AS WELL AS TO INFORM. OUR POLICIES AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY. WE UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE AFFECTS MANY ACROSS OUR STATE INCLUDING THOSE WERE WARNED OF THE POWER. SHUT OFFS AND NEVER EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF POWER. THIS WAS ONLY ONE HERE IN IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS A NO DOUBT ADDRESS CHALLENGES WITH THE POWER SHUT OFF SPECIFICALLY AND ALSO- THIS LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO UNDERSTAND. THE EXTENT IN WHICH- THESE POWER OUTAGES AFFECTED THEIR LIVES. WE HAVE QUITE A LENGTHY AGENDA TODAY WE HAVE OVER TWENTY PRESENTERS AND WE ALSO WILL HAVE A TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE HERE THAT WISH TO BE HEARD. WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AT THE END OF THE HEARING WE HAVE TRIED TO DO OUR VERY BEST TO PROVIDE- SOME LEVEL OF GEOGRAPHIC. DIVERSITY IN THIS PRESENTATION TO UNDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND. HOW THE THOUGH THE MEANS IN WHICH EVERYONE WAS IT WAS AFFECT THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THESE OUTAGES. WE ALSO KNOW. THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO HEAR THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS AND- AGENDA TODAY. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IN THE COME COMING MONTHS TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THE FULL PICTURE WE UNDERSTAND THE FULL STORY SO. HAVING SAID THAT I WANT TO WELCOME OUR OUR PRESIDENT PRO TEM TONI ATKINS TO ALLOW HER TO PROVIDE SOME OPENING COMMENTS AND- WE- WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE TO GET THE SENATE OF. TO BE RESPONSIVE ON THIS ISSUE AND- WAR WAR ALL COMMITTED REALLY TO WORK IN I WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT- SOME OF THE- MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE IN THIS PROCESS ARE NOT REPEATED AND THAT WE'RE MUCH BETTER PREPARED. IN IN HANDLE IN THESE SITUATIONS IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE EXTREME WEATHER AFFECT OUR STATE. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- GOOD MORNING EVERYONE- TO MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY- OTHER SENATORS WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO JOIN I ALSO. A KNOWLEDGE THAT I SAW ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AGUIAR-CURRY AND WAS IN THE AUDIENCE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY- TODAY WE ARE LOOKING AT THE APPLICATION OF THE POWERSHOT ALSTER IN THE RECENT FIRES AS THE CHAIRMAN SAID. A FOLLOW UP HEARING WILL ADDRESS BUILDING ON STEPS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN REGARDING WILD FIRES AND UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. THOSE STEPS INCLUDE THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S BROWN AND NEW SOME ESTABLISHING NEW WILD FIRE SAFETY PLANS OVERHAULING THE STATE'S PREVENTION AND RESPONSE EFFORTS. SUPPORTING LOCAL RECOVERY EFFORTS AND COMMITTING NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR IMPORT INVESTMENTS IN NEW EQUIPMENT AND STAFFING CAL FIRE. WE ALL KNOW THIS CRITICAL WORK MUST BE ON GOING I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK THE PANELISTS TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE PARTICIPATING TODAY. THE EXPERIENCES THAT YOU SHARE WHETHER IN PERSON OR IN WRITING WILL HELP US AS WE MOVE FORWARD. ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF HUMAN NATURE IS THE STRONG INSTINCT TO HELP IN A CRISIS. WITH WILDFIRES WE'VE SEEN THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN NEIGHBORS HELPING EACH OTHER EVACUATE WORKING TOGETHER TO SAVE THEIR HOUSES AND EVEN PROVIDING SHELTER FOR ANIMALS AND PETS. THERE HAVE BEEN SIMILAR STORIES ABOUT CALIFORNIANS AFFECTED BY THE POWER SHUT OFFS. A SMALL ANTIQUE STORE IN SHINGLE TOWN USE THEIR GENERATOR TO HELP A NEIGHBORING RESTAURANT KEEP ITS FOOD FROM SPOILING. IN CLEAR LIKE A HOME CARE AID WAS UNABLE TO HELP HER ELDERLY CLIENTS WASH CLOTHES ARE DISHES WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. AND YET SHE TOOK THEM HOT COFFEE AND JUST SPEND TIME WITH THEM REASSURING THEM THROUGHOUT THE SHUT OFF. AND THERE ARE MANY MANY MORE STORIES SOME WE MIGHT EVEN HERE TODAY. AND THE CAPITAL AS WE FOLLOW THE NATURAL INSTINCT TO HELP IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE DO SO IN A COMPREHENSIVE AFFECTED WAY THAT MAKES A REAL DIFFERENCE. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE ARTICLE I WROTE CALLING FOR A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN. LET ME SHARE JUST A FEW OF THE TOP LINES FROM THAT ARTICLE. TO MINIMIZE THE RISK TO THE PUBLIC FROM WILDFIRES IN POWER SHUT OFF. THERE MUST BE ONE OVERARCHING UMBRELLA THAT ENCOMPASSES ALL THE MOVING PARTS INVOLVED. I EXPECT THIS HEARING AND THE UPCOMING ONE WILL HELP INFORM THE SENATE'S NEXT STEPS WHICH WILL BE TAKEN WITHIN THE THREE AREAS OF FOCUS LEGISLATION OVERSIGHT. AND FUNDING THROUGH OUR STATE BUDGET. THOSE NEXT STEPS TO BE PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN. THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONVENING STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS HOW PGD GOES FORWARD AND THE PUBLIC A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS ALSO INVESTIGATING THE POWERSHOT OFFS. THOSE OUTCOMES ALSO MUST BE CONSIDERED PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN. A FEW OVERALL POINTS ARE HOPEFUL GODDESS IN OUR APPROACH. ENERGY MUST REMAIN AVAILABLE WITH MINIMAL TARGETED DISRUPTION DURING EMERGENCIES. BACKSLIDING ON OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE MAKES WILD FIRE CONDITIONS WORSE AND COST REPAIRS MORE. TAXPAYERS SHOULD NOT BE ON THE HOOK FOR BAILING OUT SHAREHOLDERS WHO HAVE PROFITED FROM UTILITY INVESTMENTS. UTILITIES PLANS FOR HARDENING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO REDUCE FIRES MUST INCLUDE A REALISTIC TIME LINE A WORK SCHEDULE THE PUBLIC CAN SEE AND DEPEND UPON. AND REAL ACCOUNTABILITY IF GOALS ARE NOT MET. WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE WILDFIRES ARE ALSO STARTED BY SOURCES OTHER THAN UTILITY EQUIPMENT. LIGHTNING CAR ENGINES DRAGGING CHANGE AND SO ON ONE MAN WAS ARRESTED RECENTLY AFTER FLYING HERE FROM MISSOURI JUST TO START FIRES. OUR PREPARATIONS NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND THAT'S WHY MOVING FORWARD ON IMPROVING FIRE CONDITIONS BY COMBAT IN CLIMATE CHANGE REMAINS SO IMPORTANT. THERE ARE ALSO MANY QUESTIONS THAT THE WORK OF I'D DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN CAN HELP ANSWER. ARE THERE WAYS TO JUMPSTART THE HARDENING PROCESS SO MORE PEOPLE ARE SPARED SHUT OFF FASTER WITHOUT TAXPAYERS ARE UTILITY CUSTOMERS BEING LEFT ON THE HOOK. HOW CAN WE IMPROVE COMMUNICATION FOR EVACUATIONS AND OTHER EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS AND FIND SOLUTIONS TO CELL TOWERS FAILING AT A TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC IS RELYING ON THEM THE MOST. HOW CAN WE BEST DEPLOYS STATE ASSETS SUCH AS COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS FOR USE IN EMERGENCIES WITH RESOURCES LIKE WIFI AND CHARGING STATIONS THAT CAN BE ON SITE. IN A STATE ALREADY SHORT OF HOUSING HOW DO WE ADDRESS INSURANCE AND BUILDING ISSUES NOW THAT WILD FIRES OWNS HAVE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES BUSINESS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ADEQUATELY PROTECT AND ARE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR CLIENTS WHEN THERE ARE FIRES POWER SHUT OFFS OR OTHER EMERGENCIES. SO THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FOR BEING PART OF THIS HEARING AND FOR LETTING ME SHARE SOME THOUGHTS I BELIEVE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS EXPECT US TO TREAT THESE ISSUES URGENTLY. BUT ALSO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AND AGAIN TO ME THAT MEANS A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ALL THE DOCUMENTED FACTS NEW PROPOSALS EXISTING POLICIES ARE ASSESSED AND IMPLEMENTED IN A TIMELY AND TRANSPARENT MANNER. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND WHEN AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THOSE EXPECTATIONS ARE NOT MET SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BACK TO YOU THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MATTER PRESIDENT TO NOT WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR VICE CHAIR SENATOR MORLOCK WHO IS GOING TO BE ASSISTANT. RUNNING THIS COMMITTEE HERE TODAY SO ONE OF MAKES COMMENTS YES MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WE HAD- AN ISSUE WITH THE UTILITIES WHEN I WAS THE TREASURER OF THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE BUT BACK THEN WE CALL THEM BROWN OUTS IN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE WENT AHEAD AND PAID A LOWER UTILITY RATE. SO THAT WE CAN TURN OUR ELECTRICITY OFF TO PROVIDE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY FOR NEIGHBORS BUT THAT WAS RESULT OF. STATE LEGISLATION IT THERE WAS THE RESULT OF DEREGULATING- THE ELECTRIC MARKET AND WE SAW THAT- IT- HAD A MAJOR IMPACTED PROHIBITED AND NATURAL GAS ACQUISITION IN THE FUTURES MARKET. AND WE WATCHED UTILITIES BE MANIPULATED IN THE SPOT MARKET- AND THEN WE SAW POOR GOVERNOR DAVIS- KIND OF TURN A PROBLEM INTO A MESS. SO SACRAMENTO- HAD TO MAKE MASSIVE ENERGY LOANS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WAS DOWNGRADED P. JEANNIE FILED FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN THE FIRST TIME. AND WITHIN A FEW WEEKS WE'VE WE LOST GOVERNOR DAVIS TO THE SECOND RECALL OF THE SITTING GOVERNOR IN U. S. HISTORY SO THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. KINDA REVERBERATES WITH ME BECAUSE I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND IN THAT COMMOTION I EVEN FOUND MYSELF BEING THE CHAIR OF THE CREDITORS COMMITTEE FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SO TWO TWO DECADES LATER HERE. WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING SIMILARITIES SO WHEN SACRAMENTO. SACRAMENTO MAKES DEMANDS. THE OF ON THE UTILITIES PERHAPS THIS TIME IN THE PURSUIT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION- SUBSIDIZING ELECT THE ELECTRIC CAR INDUSTRY. BUT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE ADDITIONAL LOW DEMANDS THAT RECHARGING EXACTS. AND WITH NEW MANDATES THE I. O. U.'S. SEEM TO HAVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND DID NOT FOCUS ON HARDENING ASSETS FROM PROVING TRANSMISSION LINES BUT SCORCHING. SANTANA DIABLO WINS WE'VE HAD FOR MILLENNIA SO THIS IS NOTHING RELATIVELY NEW BUT INVERSE CONDEMNATION CERTAINLY HAS MADE THE FOCUS A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC BECAME VERY PROACTIVE- FACT COMMUNICATING WITH ME ALMOST A- MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. WHEN WE HAD A SANTA ANA CONDITION CITY OF ANAHEIM WHICH HAS ITS OWN PUBLIC UTILITY TWENTY YEARS AGO STARTED TO UNDERGROUND IT'S- A HIGH VOLTAGE LINES IN. WHILE I AYE WILDFIRES OWNS- IN THERE ABOUT 90% COMPLETED YES IT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY YES IT'S EXPENSIVE YES IT TAKES TIME BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN YOU'VE GOT TO BE MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE IT'S A WHOLE LOT CHEAPER AND LESS TO STRESSFUL BEEN LOSE LIFE AND PROPERTY. SO MISTER CHAIR. I'VE HAD BEEN HAVING FUN IN THIS SPACE BECAUSE ORANGE COUNTY HAD A RATHER TRAGIC WILDFIRE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WITH THE LAGUNA BEACH FIRE OVER FOUR HUNDRED HOMES WERE LOST- LIVES WERE CHANGED AND- SO WE TRY TO GET TO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CPUC IN CALIFORNICA MAPS- IN POPULAR THE WILDFIRES OWNS IN ORDER TO PRIORITIZE AREAS IN NEED OF HARDENING OR UNDER GROUNDING. AT WAS SENT SENATE BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY THREE BUT IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR EVEN THOUGH IT RECEIVE NO ZERO VOTES. IN BOTH CHAMBERS. THE CPUC IN CALIFORNIA TO WORKING FOR EIGHT YEARS BEHIND. ON ON FIRE MAPS THEY WERE BEHIND SCHEDULE WHEN SANTA ROSA SONOMA NAPA. SAW THE LOSS OF FORTY TWO LIVES SO WE CAN DO BETTER MISTER CHAIR I DIDN'T EITHER BILL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO USE CAP AND TRADE TAX REVENUES TO HARDEN ELECTRIC LINES. IT WAS KILLED BUT IN ENVIRONMENT QUALITY BUT I'M I'M I'M REALLY PLEASED THAT SENATOR DODD INCLUDED IT IN SB NINE OH ONE- LATER THAT YEAR. WE'VE ALSO DONE A BILL TO USE RULE TWENTY A AND I LIKE TO ASK THIS WHEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. ON TRYING TO USE FUNDS THAT ARE READY AVAILABLE FOR UNDER GETTING ANOTHER. OPPORTUNITIES BUT WE'RE GENERATING GREENHOUSE GASES WITH THESE WILDFIRES AND WE NEED TO MONITOR THOSE AND- I HAD- BILL THIS YEAR FIVE THREE FIVE TWO GOT LOCKED UP IN ITS ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS HAVING FUN BUT WE'RE TRYING. BUT WE'VE GOT TO WORK A LITTLE BETTER A LITTLE MORE THOUGHTFUL. AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN A HOLISTIC APPROACH IT'S INTEGRATED WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE ELECTRICITY- WILDFIRES. SO I'M I'M GRATEFUL MISTER CHAIR THAT YOU PUT THE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES UP EARLY IN THE AGENDA- THEY HAVE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BUT SACRAMENTO HAS MADE THEIR CORE MISSION. AND NOT VERY EASY AND WE MAY HAVE TO. LOOK AT THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THEIR PS PS STRATEGY IN IT MIGHT BE STARING US IN THE FACE. SO WITH THAT MISTER CIARA HOPING TO SERIOUS REFLECTION ON THE ENTIRE TOPIC OF PROVIDING ELECTRICITY. THE CALIFORNIANS THE DECADES TO COME AND I HOPE WE FIND WAYS TO PROVIDE. IT MORE SAFELY. AND MORE CHEAPLY. OUR RESIDENTS PAY A HIGHER. TAXES. HI UTILITY BILLS HI HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE PREMIUMS IF THEY CAN. GET THEM. AND NOW THEY'RE PAYING MASSIVE SUMS TO REFILL THEIR FREEZERS WITH LAS PROVISIONS. SO CALIFORNIA. THE YOU KNOW NEEDS TO BE SENSITIVE TO ALL THESE ISSUES THESE ARE LEARNING EXPENSE AND LEARNING AND EXPENSE OF LESSONS. SACRAMENTO NEEDS TO MAKE SERIOUS MODIFICATIONS INTERNALLY. AS IT IMPROVES ITS OVERSIGHT ON THESE CRITICAL ENERGY PROVIDERS LET'S BE STRATEGIC. LET'S AVOID CHASING THE CONCERN OF THE DAY LET'S PROVIDE INTELLIGENT LEADERSHIP THAT EMPOWERS. THE PROVIDERS ANYA OVERSEERS LET'S BE BIG PICTURE. AND PROVIDE A BALANCED APPROACH TO LECTURE CITY IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR LETTING ME. THROW THAT INTO THE MIX THANK COLLEAGUES AND I KNOW WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THESE FIRES IN A VERY BIG WAY. AND THE PRESENT HERE TODAY AND- WE HAVE- QUITE A LINEUP OF SPEAKERS AND THEY'LL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT IF ANY MEMBERS AT THIS POINT WANT TO MAKE SOME OPENING COMMENTS SO. ALLOW THAT IF THE BRIEF. CENTER DOT. IDEA MISTER CHAIR I CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THE SUBJECT BUT IN RESPECT TO- THE MATTER SPEAKERS WE HAVE IN YOUR ADMONITION TO BE. CONCISE I WILL BE BRIEF- YOU KNOW SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY WILD FIRES- THE I AUTHORED SB NINE OH ONE IN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. I BELIEVE THE DE ENERGIZING POWER LINES IN ADVANCE OF THE SEVERE WIND STORM WOULD BE A RARE. STRATEGICALLY TARGETED AND LAST OPTION DEFENSE AGAINST A UTILITY IGNITION OF A WILDFIRE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT PS PS PROTOCOLS CALLED FOR AN SB NINE OH ONE WOULD BE CAREFULLY REVIEWED AND IF NECESSARY. MODIFIED BY CBC BEFORE APPROVAL AS CALLED FOR IN THE STATUTE. UNFORTUNATELY IN A AN ACCEPTABLY UNACCEPTABLY IN THIS CASE A P. JEANNIE SHUT OFFS HAVE BEEN APPLIED BROADLY WITH LITTLE OR NO STRATEGIC PLANNING- IT'S APPARENT THE P. GENIES IMPLEMENTATION OF THE P. S. P. S. IS A DIRECT FUNCTION OF. THE DECREPIT CONDITION OF ITS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. REFLECTING DECADE TO DISREGARD TO ITS MANDATE TO SERVE ITS CUSTOMERS RELIABLY AND SAFELY. THIS NO LONGER CAN BE THE CASE THE CPUC MUST AND I BELIEVE WILL EXERCISE ITS AUTHORITY AND DO A BETTER JOB OF REGULATION OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. WHAT A PS PS MUST BE INITIATED HOW COULD BE DONE IN THE MOST PRECISE AND STRATEGIC MANNER SO AS TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF IMPACTED CUSTOMERS FOR THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME AND WITH THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF RELIEF FOR AFFECTED BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE YOU. CENTER STERN. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM FOR. RESPONDING WITH THE URGENCY I THINK THE PUBLIC IS DEMANDING IN CALLING US HERE TODAY AT OF SESSION- AMID TO FOR MY COMMENTS TO THOSE WHO. COULDN'T MAKE IT HERE TODAY. WE ALL CAN TAKE A SOUTHWEST FLIGHT AND TAKE TIME OUT OF OUR SCHEDULE BECAUSE THIS IS OUR JOB TO BE HERE- BUT ALLEN FROM SEAMY VALLEY. T. FROM THOUSAND OAKS IN ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED OTHER CONSTITUENTS OF MINE WHO'VE WEIGHED IN WITH SPECIFIC COMMENTS COULDN'T SO IF I COULD JUST READ TWO SENSES OF THEIRS- IS MY OPENING COMMENTS- SO ALLEN SAYS MIKE MY FAMILY. INCLUDING MY WIFE IS ON OXYGEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. AND A VENTILATOR TWELVE HOURS A DAY MY PARENTS WHO ARE IN THEIR EIGHTIES HAVE SUFFERED POWER OUTAGES CAUSED BY. EASY FIRE AND MULTIPLES A SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED OUTAGES. I PURCHASED A BACKUP GENERATOR KEEP MY WIFE'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY EQUIPMENT RUNNING SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS THE WAR IN A FIXED INCOME. AND EDISON IS OFFERED NO FINANCIAL AID AT ALL. I'M AN ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY CRISES THERE'S BEEN SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH AIR QUALITY. AND DUE TO SMOKE ASH ANOTHER PARTICULAR TEN IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS MY WIFE HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED TWICE. ONCE FOR FIVE DAYS AND ONCE FOR THIRTY DAYS. T. SAYS. MY SON SHE'S FROM THOUSAND OAKS MY SON RELIES ON A FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR VILE MEDICINE TO STAY ALIVE. THE SCHOOL STORES THAT- THAT VIAL AT SCHOOL BUT ON OCTOBER ELEVENTH ELECTRICITY WAS SHUT OFF AT OUR MIDDLE SCHOOL BECAUSE OF HIGH WINDS IS BEEN SHUT OFF MULTIPLE TIMES SINCE. THE SCHOOL CONTACTED ME AND TOLD ME THE MEDICINE GOT WARMED. WAS SPOILED AND THEY REFUSE TO USE IT. NOW IT'S COSTING ME OVER FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE TIME THE POWER GOES DOWN TO KEEP MY SON ALIVE THIS IS NOT RIGHT. COMPLETELY AGREED MY CONSTITUENTS ND LOOK FOR DIGGING IN FURTHER HERE TODAY TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO YOU IN THE PRO TIME FOR CONVENING THIS- TIME SENSITIVE. HEARING BECAUSE FRANKLY WERE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW PARTICULARLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- WHERE WE HAVE UTILITY THAT IS REPEATEDLY STARTING CATASTROPHIC FIRES- AND THAT IS TURNING OFF THE POWER TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THE P. JEANNIE LIKES TO TALK IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTS THERE ARE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ACCOUNTS THAT WERE TURNED OFF. THAT IS LIKE TWO AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WE NEED TO START TALKING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPACTED. WHO HAVE TO STORE THEIR MEDICINE RETURN ON THEIR VIOLATORS. WHO CAN'T GO TO WORK BECAUSE THEIR JOB SITE IS SHUT DOWN AND THEY DON'T GET PAID PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO STAY HOME BECAUSE THEIR KIDS DON'T HAVE A SCHOOL TO GO TO AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE SHUTTING DOWN AND POTENTIALLY GOING OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE BEING SHUT DOWN FOR A WEEK DOESN'T WORK- FOR MOST- BUSINESSES. DON WE THOUGHT THAT P. GINNY WOULD USE A SCALPEL- IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN BLACKOUTS- AND INSTEAD P. GINNY HAS CHOSEN TO USE A SLEDGEHAMMER AND THEN TURN AROUND AND ESSENTIALLY TELL THE PUBLIC SORRY SUCK IT UP WE'LL FIX IT IN TEN YEARS- AND WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS RESULTED- NOT TRUST FROM CLIMATE CHANGE YES CLIMATE CHANGE IS PART OF IT. BUT THIS IS A UTILITY THAT FOR DECADES NOW HAS NOT INVESTED APPROPRIATELY AND IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE IT HAS PAID DIVIDENDS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS- AT A COMPANY THAT HAS SIMPLY BEEN BEYOND THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE IN THE WAY THAT IT HAS MAINTAINED AND OPERATED AT SYSTEM AND SO WE NOW HAVE WILD FIRES- ON A SCALE THAT UNIMAGINABLE AND BLACKOUTS ON A SCALE UNIMAGINABLE IN CALIFORNIA. THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WHERE IT APPEARS THAT WE CAN NO LONGER EVEN KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND THAT IS BEYOND UNACCEPTABLE- I ALSO BECAUSE I AM IN P. JEANNIE TERRITORY I GET ALL THE EMAILS- IMPLORING ME AND OTHERS TO GO OUT AND PURCHASE DIESEL GENERATORS US BECAUSE SINCE P. GINNY CAN'T KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BUY DIESEL GENERATORS- WHICH POLLUTE- WHICH CAUSE FIRES AND WHICH BECAUSE CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING AT THE SAME TIME. BUT ALL THIS IS HAPPENING RPG ANY CONTINUES TO HIRE ARMIES OF LOBBYISTS TO OPPOSE EVERY SINGLE AFTER TO EXPAND SOLAR ENERGY STORAGE AND OTHER DISTRIBUTED. ENERGY RESOURCES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY GENERATE. OUR OWN POWER AND STORE IT AND THEN HAVE BACKUP POWER THAT IS NOT POLLUTING AND CAUSING FIRES AND CAUSING CARBON MONOXIDE. POISONING AND AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW PGA ANY IS ADVOCATING TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION NOT TO FULLY FUND THE S. CHIP PROGRAM WHICH WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS TO OBTAIN ENERGY STORAGE. WHY IS P. GINNY ADVOCATING AGAINST EXPANDING ENERGY STORAGE SERVICE COMPANY IN MY MIND. HAS FORFEITED ITS RIGHT TO OPERATE AS AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY WE NEED FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL CHANGE AT PGA ANY BECAUSE THE STATUS QUO JUST ISN'T WORKING AND HASN'T WORKED FOR A LONG TIME THANK YOU. SIR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT IS A VERY FINE TO THE CHAIR WHO CHECKED IN- THROUGHOUT- FIRES AND POWER SHUT OFF THE VERY VERY GRATEFUL AND OF COURSE TO THE PRO TIM. WHO IS DONE THE SAME ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT. NOW IN FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER TODAY SO WE- TRULY APPRECIATE IT. MY WORDS AND I'LL BE QUICK FOR THE CHAIR MY WORDS ARE NOT REFLECTED TO THE HARD WORKING MEN WOMEN TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON EVERY DAY. OR TURN THE GAS BACK ON. BUT WITH MY FRUSTRATION WITH THE PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC CORPORATION. EVERY POWER ALMOST EVERY POWER OUTAGE WITH SOME NUMBER WOULDN'T AS SOON AGUIAR-CURRY MYSELF AND CENTER DOT OF SCENE OF MOSTLY BEEN IN OUR BACKYARDS IN IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT. AND THE RESIDENTS OF THE NORTH BAY AND THE NORTH COAST ARE TIRED. THEIR SUFFERING THEY NEED ASSISTANCE. NOT JUST FROM THE DESTRUCTIVE FIRES BUT BY THESE THE BUCKLES OF POWER OUTAGES IT IS BEEN CHRIS BECOME CRYSTAL CLEAR TO ME THAT P. JEANNIE LACKS THE BASIC FUNDAMENTALS TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE SUCH A LARGE AND COMPLEX OUT EACH LET ALONE MULTIPLE OUTAGES. THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITIES ON THE NORTH COAST THAT DID NOT HAVE POWER FOR ELEVEN STRAIGHT DAYS. MOST COMMUNITIES IN OCTOBER DID NOT HAVE POWER IN NORTHERN MINISTERIAL. I TWO NOMINEES ZENO NORTON CINEMA AS WELL AS LAKE COUNTY FOR SEVEN STRAIGHT DAYS TRY TO BE A OPERATE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS. BUT WITHOUT POWER. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS HAVE BEEN LOST IN COMMERCE. HOSPITALS ARE PUT ON DIVERT SAINT JOSEPH HOSPITAL IN. DOUBLE COUNTY HAD TO CANCEL SURGERIES FOR THE GREATER PART OF A WORK WEEK DAYS AND DAYS OF SCHOOL HAVE BEEN CLOSED WITH LITTLE TO NO CHANCE BE TO MAKE HIM UP. I THINK THERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. OVER ONE THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN CANDIDLY DECADES OF MISMANAGEMENT BY PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC. PUTTING THEIR SHAREHOLDERS ABOVE THEIR CUSTOMERS. NUMBER TWO THE LACK OF SUPERVISION ENFORCEMENT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING P. GENIES PLANS FOR THESE PUBLIC SHUT OFF EVENTS. THEY ALSO HOLD RESPONSIBILITY. PASSIVELY THAT WE'RE FACING A NEW CLIMATE REALITY WHICH IS CAUGHT UP WITH P. JEANNIE THANK OUR USER OWN STATISTIC BACK IN 20001215% OF THEIR LINES WERE AN ELEVATED FIRE RISK ZONES TODAY. IT'S 50% OF ALL LINES. WE CANNOT CONTINUE WHAT SOME CALL THE NEW NORMAL WITH POWER SHUT OFF. WE NEED TO BE A EXPERT I GREAT HARDENING THAT YOU MANAGEMENT AND MODERNIZATION. TEN YEARS TELLING CUSTOMERS TEN YEARS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. WE MUST% BETTER PINPOINT OUTAGES VERSUS TAKING THE NEAT MEAT CLEAVER APPROACH THAT HAVE IMPACTED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. REASON WHY HUMBOLDT COUNTY LOST THEIR POWER- HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE AN ABILITY TO BE A SWITCH THE LINES THE MAIN FEEDER LINES COMING INTO THE COUNTY AND IT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE IN FIRE DANGER. WE NEED TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY RESPONSE PLANS ESPECIALLY FOR THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE PINPOINTING CUSTOMERS BASED OFF OF THE CARE PROGRAM WITHIN P. JEANNIE SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK AND IN FACT RELIEVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THE MOST MEDICALLY FRAGILE IN THEIR TERRITORY. OUT OF COMMUNICATION HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF CELL TOWERS WENT DOWN DURING THIS LATEST OUTAGE. AND IT'S NOT ABOUT CHECK IN THE LATEST FACEBOOK STATUSES LITERALLY ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THOUSANDS BEEN PUT AT RISK BECAUSE CELL PHONE TOWERS WENT DOWN AND I WILL BE CANDID WITHYOU MISTER CHAIR. I WAS TOLD BY EXECUTIVES IN JUNE. A TELECOM EXECUTIVES IN JUNE THAT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD NOT HAPPEN. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN OVER THE LAST MANY WEEKS. AND WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE PERFORMANCE METRICS IN STATE LAW. TO ENSURE UTILITIES HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES IF THEY'RE NOT HITTING THEIR GOALS AND WRAP IT UP RIGHT HERE. I THINK WE'RE ON OUR THIRD STRIKE. THIRD STRIKE FOR P. JEANNIE. RIGHT ONE WAS A SANGRIA SAN BRUNO GAS EXPLOSION AT THE TRIED TO COVER UP. AND THEN THEY LIED ABOUT IT. STRIKE TO WHERE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES. STRIKE THREE'S A WOEFULLY INADEQUATE RESPONSE. TO THESE POWER SHUT OFFS. WE CANNOT NIP AROUND THE EDGES IT'S NOW TIME FOR THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE. HEY FAILED US TOO MANY TIMES THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU CENTER CHIANG. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO THANK THE PRO TEM IN THE CHAIR FOR CALLING FOR THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING. I AM SO I AM FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE SHUT OFF HAVE OBVIOUSLY IMPACTED ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS IN FACT I HAD TO OF FIRES IN MY DISTRICT- WITHIN THIS PAST MONTH AND A COUPLE OF A- PEACE PS PST VANS. I'M LOOKING TO HEARING MORE ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN DONE WHAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON I MEAN FRANKLY THIS IS HORRENDOUS AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. ON A SIMILAR NOTE I'M EAGER TO HEAR FROM ANDERSON BECAUSE MOST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS AT THIS AND- I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED- IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ASSETS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE TALK ABOUT. AND FRANKLY THERE'S AN OBVIOUS NEED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY WHETHER IT BE THE UTILITIES ARE REGULATING ENTITIES AND IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS AND WE NEED ANSWERS OKAY SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING. OF FROM FROM. THE TESTIMONIES THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- PRO TEM FOR ALLOWING US THIS OPPORTUNITY AND THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME IS NOT A MEMBER THIS COMMITTEE BE ABLE TO SIT HERE. WE HAVE SUFFERED ALL OVER CALIFORNIA BUT PROBABLY NONE GREATER THAN THE COMMUNITY OF PARADISE IN THE REGION BUTTE COUNTY. TOMORROW A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND LEGISLATORS ARE GOING TO GO WITH US UP THERE TO SEE THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE. BUT EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE AROUND TO SEE THIS. AS WE THEN PROCEEDED. AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE HOW IT'S AFFECTED THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT THAT EVERYBODY FOR THE LEGISLATION THAT HAS MOVED FORWARD IN FACT THIS PAST YEAR. THE LEGISLATURE HAS RESPONDED BUT WE HAVE MUCH YET I HAD TO DO. AND AS A STRATEGY FOR CONTAINING CATACLYSMIC WILDFIRES THE NEW NORMAL CANNOT BE. PUBLIC SAFETY SUSPENSIONS BUT POWER. THAT CAN NOT BE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT A DISGRACE IT THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE HANDLING OUR BUSINESS AND THE MAGNET THAT MAGNITUDE TO WHICH THIS HAS AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL LIVES ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. IS INTOLERABLE. WE WILL BE RESPONDING. IN MAKING THIS BETTER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU ARE WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR FIRST PRESENTER. OR DID YOU WANT MAKES COMMENTS OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER JENNER I WANT TO ALSO THANK THE PRO TEM AND ARE CHAIR FOR A PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND- IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT I KNOW EVERYONE TOUCHED UPON EVERYTHING I WANTED TO SAY BUT IN PARTICULAR. THERE'S SO MANY STORIES IT ON HERE AND- BY WAY OF EXAMPLE I GOT CALLS FROM MANY MOTHERS WHO HAVE. STUDENTS EITHER IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND THE READING A LITTLE APARTMENT THEY CAN'T AFFORD FOOD AND I WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT I'VE- CONSISTENTLY- HEARD FROM MY- MY CONSTITUENTS THEIR KIDS WHO. DON'T HAVE FOOD AND- AND THEY DON'T HAVE POWER AND WHAT DO THEY DO IT THEY COULD. AFFORD TO. PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE SALE THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THIS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING TO ALL THE- SOLUTIONS MITIGATION EFFORTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR PRESENTATION. I'M BEGINNING WITH ROSS BROWN HE'S THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE SAID FISCAL. AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND HE'LL BE SPEAKING IN ON THE. WHAT IS THE PSP AND- WHAT. IS WHAT ITS HISTORY AND WHAT HAS GIVEN ITS AUTHORITY TO BE. IMPLEMENTED IN THIS PART OF OUR FIRE FIGHTING STRATEGY FOR THE STATE. AND JUST A LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT- RELATED TO SIMPLY MEMBERS WOULD AND AGUIAR-CURRY THAT ARE HERE JOINING US FROM THE- PUBLIC. MISTER ROSS MISTER BROWN SORRY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ROSS BROWN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE OFFERING JUST SOME COMMENTS AND BACKGROUND ON PS PS AND THE AUTHORITY AND GUIDANCE IN THE STATE ROLE- YOU SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT THAT I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM HOPEFULLY THAT WAS- YOU CONTACT IN ADVANCE IF NOT THE SERGEANTS AT A COPY SO PLEASE FLAG THEM DOWN COMMENTS BRIEF GIVEN THE NUMBER OF SPEAKERS YOU HAVE AND I'M SURE GOING TO LET THESE ISSUES IN MORE DETAIL LATER ON- I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO COMMENT ON. ON FOUR MAIN THINGS ONE THE HISTORY OF THE AUTHORITY AND GUIDANCE AROUND P. S. P. S. ADVANCE TO THE STATE ROLE AND IN PARTICULAR ON SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS- THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON UTILITIES FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THREE SOME OF THE SUPPORTS FOR OF HONORABLE RESIDENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEM AND DURING P. S. P. S. OFFENSE AND FINALLY SOME OF THE BUDGET ALLOCATIONS. AND RESOURCES THAT WERE PROVIDED IN THE MOST RECENT BUDGET. TRYING TO PUT OUT AT A HIGH LEVEL SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT. WE HAVE A- TIME LINE THAT- TOUCHES ON SOME OF THE MAJOR MILESTONES. GOING BACK. TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS. AROUND PS PS AUTHORITY AND GUIDANCE- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- AFTER SOME SEVERE FIRES IN SAN DIEGO. SAN DIEGO GAS AND A LESS ELECTRIC REQUESTED- AUTHORITY FOR A PLAN TO IMPLEMENT SHUT OFFS FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THAT REQUEST WAS. INITIALLY DENIED. WITHOUT PREJUDICE- BUT PC DID NOTE THAT- SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC HAD UNDER CURRENT LAW THE AUTHORITY TO EMPLOYMENT THE PROGRAM BUT THE PC TONIGHT FOR THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM THAT WAS BEING REQUESTED- SH SEVERAL YEARS ATER ANSWER SOME FURTHER ANALYSIS AND TWENTY TWELVE THE PC ADOPTS. A GENERAL SHUT OFF REQUIREMENTS FOR SDG AND GINNY- SOME GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AROUND NOTIFICATION AND SOME OF THE CRITERIA THAT. UTILITIES MIGHT USE SUCH AS- WIND SPEED AND HUMIDITY ONE OF TRIMMING WHETHER NOT TO SHUT OFF. POWER FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AFTER SEVERE FIRES AS YOU ALL KNOW IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND UTILITIES WERE CONSIDERING IMPLEMENTING. E. S. P. S. EVENTS- MORE FREQUENTLY. THE P. C. ISSUED A RESOLUTION EXTENDING SOME OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY- JUST. IMPOSED ON SDG NEED TO THE OTHER I'LL USE. LATER IN THAT YEAR AS YOU ALL KNOW THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB NINE A ONE REQUIRING UTILITIES TO INCLUDE YES YES- PROTOCOLS IN THEIR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. EARLIER THIS YEAR SEVERAL IMPORTANT MILESTONES PC IN RESPONSE TO THOSE SB NINE A ONE REQUIREMENTS ISSUED SOME- DISS A DECISION- THAT INCLUDED MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON PS PS EVENTS MOSTLY ON SOME OF THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS- CUSTOMERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS. AND COORDINATION WITH SOME OF THOSE PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS THERE'S A SECOND PHASE OF- THAT THE PROCEEDING WHERE THEY- PLAN ON GETTING INTO MORE DETAIL AROUND. SOME OF PROCESS SEASON CRITERIA THAT ARE USED TO DETERMINE WHEN AND HOW THOSE SHOTS OCCUR. THE LGISLATURE ALSO PASSED A FEW BILL BILLS THIS YEAR PROVIDING SOME MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON THE PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED- IN THE UTILITY P. S. TS PROTOCOLS. AND THEN- FINALLY IN IN OCTOBER AFTER SOME OF THE PRESIDENT AND EVENTS- THE UC STATED ITS INTENT TO RE EXAMINE THE CURRENT GUIDANCE AND LAUNCHED A FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO UTILITY COMPLIANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE OF THIRTY IN- ALREADY. IN THE REGULATIONS. TO TURN THE PAGE TO YOUR HAND OUT- BUT JUST A QUICK A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF THE STATE ROLE WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPOSED ON UTILITIES- AND SOME OF THE GUIDANCE OFFERED JUST UC PROVIDES GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR WHEN UTILITIES MAY DEPLOY P. S. P. S. EVENTS- SPECIFICALLY IT SHOULD BE USED AS A- MEASURE OF LAST RESORT- BUT I THINK. AND PERHAPS THE KEY POINT HERE IS THAT THE UTILITIES ABOUT THE STATE DETERMINE WHEN AND WHERE POWER IS SHUT OFF- A PC PROVIDES GENERAL GUIDANCE AROUND- KEY FACTORS TO CONSIDER BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY THE UTILITIES MAKING THAT DECISION. THE PC DOES HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDANCE AROUND NOTIFICATION- BOTH TO PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS. AND CONSUMERS ARE TWO TO THREE NOTE DAYS NOTIFICATION- TO PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS ONE TO TWO DAYS AT LEAST NOTIFICATION TO ALL OTHER CUSTOMERS. SHE TURNED TO PAGE THREE ON YOUR HAND OUT. JUST A BRIEF DISCUSSION AROUND SOME OF THE P. C. REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES TO COORDINATE WITH STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE SO I'LL USE MUST COORDINATE WITH. STATE LOCAL AGENCIES IN COURT INCLUDING THE- GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE SOME OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE- ALLOW IN- YES TO AND- PUT A LIAISON AND THE UTILITIES EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTERS AND MICE FOR SO. AND SO PROVIDING ENSURING DATA- ON WHO COULD POTENTIALLY BE IMPACTED BY THE- THE POWER SHUT OFFS. AND FINALLY PC REQUIRES UTILITIES TO SUBMIT A POST EVENT REPORT WITHIN TEN DAYS AND SOME OF THE INFORMATION INCLUDING THOSE REPORTS INCLUDES LESSONS LEARNED FROM THOSE EVENTS. PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT INCLUDES SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS ON VULNERABLE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS- UTILITIES MUST TAKE EXTRA STEPS TO NOTIFY VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS- A LOT OF THOSE ACTIVITIES REVOLVE AROUND- MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS TO- ENROLL IN A PROGRAM TO RECEIVE DISCOUNTED RATES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PIECE OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. THAT REQUIRES ELECTRICITY AND SO A LOT OF THE UTILITIES TAKE EXTRA UTILITIES TAKE EXTRA STEPS TO TRY TO NOTIFY. THOSE CUSOMERS AND IN SOME CASES- ACTUALLY GOING TO THOSE RESIDENCES AND KNOCKING ON DOORS TO TRY TO NOTIFY THEM OF THE OF THE POTENTIAL PS PS OF AND- UTILITIES ALSO HAVE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER SET UP- AND- THE PC REQUIRES UTILITIES TWO ASSISTS. CRITICAL FACILITIES SUCH AS HOSPITALS. FIRE STATIONS- TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS TO EVALUATE THEIR POWER NEEDS DURING THE SHUT OFFS AND IN SOME CASES WILL. PROVIDE BACKUP POWER IF NOTHING ELSE IS THERE. PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT- WE DON'T I DON'T THINK IN THE HANDOUT DO JUSTICE TO ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE FROM- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- PRIVATE- NONPROFIT ENTITIES TO. HELP SUPPORT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS I KNOW YOU BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT- FROM THOSE. FOLKS IN ORGANIZATIONS LATER ON WE JUST WANNA FLY GOOD THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE- ONE KIND OF STATE RESOURCE THAT WAS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED WAS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ESTABLISHED A. HOT LINE. FOR VULNERABLE RESIDENTS TO CALL IN AND- CASES A P. S. P. S. EVENTS AND HAS WEBSITE THAT HAS A VARIETY OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR INFORMATION- SINCE YOU'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THAT I'M SURE LATER ON- MOVE ON FINALLY TO THE- LAST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT PAGE SIX. WE DISCUSS. TO SOME OF THE KEY BUDGET ITEMS THAT WERE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- THE BIGGEST ONE BEING THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION TO CAL- YES. TO PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO PS PS EVENTS- THE BUDGET PROVIDED THE FLEXIBILITY TO THAN MINISTRATION REGARDING HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT MONEY. HOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALLOCATED TO HALF OF THAT MONEY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING COUNTIES CITIES AND TRIBES- SOME OF THE OLDER WILL USES INCLUDE PURCHASING- BACK UP ENERGY SOURCES FOR ESSENTIAL FACILITIES SUCH AS HOSPITALS- DEVELOPING PLANS TO PROTECT PROTECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND. DEVELOPING RISK ASSESSMENTS OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FINALLY- JUST ONE OTHER BUDGET ITEM TO NOTE THAT BUDGET INCLUDE ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- TO FIND- EIGHT POSITIONS TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT. OVER A AND IT'LL POLICY REGARDING P. S. P. S. EVENTS- PREVIOUSLY THERE WERE NO OF STAFF AT PC DEDICATED EXCLUSIVELY. TO PSP US OVERSIGHT. SO I WILL IN MY COMMENTS THERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ELSE WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FROM THE PRO TEM FOR. BRINGING THAT URGENCY- TO THIS OVERSIGHT PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF THE RECENT INCIDENTS- A QUESTION FOR MISTER BROWN I APPRECIATE YOUR OVER VIEW I KNOW IT'S A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW PARTICULARLY INTERESTED ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS IN LONGHORN PROTOCOL. FOR COORDINATION WITH TELECOM COMPANIES TO PROVIDE. COMMUNICATION WITH THEM ABOUT PLANNED SHUTDOWNS AND TO COORDINATE GETTING GENERATORS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE CELL TOWERS. IF I RECALL CORRECTLY I THINK THERE WAS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT JUST PASSED THIS YEAR THAT- KIND OF SET UP PUT SOME REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE TO KIND OF FACILITATE THAT COMMUNICATION AND TRY TO ASSIST IN- YOU KNOW IN PROVIDING- AT LEAST YEP COMMUNICATING WITH AND TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS BACK UP POWER AVAILABLE THAT FACILITY AT THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES WELL I KNOW SPEAKING FROM MY DISTRICT IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. MONTEREY SANTA CRUZ SANTA CLARA COUNTIES- THAT COMMUNICATION. EITHER DIDN'T HAPPEN- WAS SEEN ADEQUATE AND I THINK PART OF THE PUBLIC EMERGENCY ALL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM- YES AND OTHERS- IS COMPROMISED TWIN. THE TELECOM COMPANIES AREN'T PART OF. THE COORDINATION IN ALLOWED THE ABILITY TO MOBILIZE EMERGENCY GENERATORS TOOK TO MAINTAIN COMMUNICATION. THE LACK OF THAT COMMUNICATION. CAN PUT LIVES AT RISK IT ALSO CONTAINS WRAPPED OPERATIONS OF SCHOOLS AND OTHERS THAT CAN'T COMMUNICATE. WITH FAMILIES ALSO RELATED TO THAT IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT OF COORDINATION WITH SCHOOLS OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WITH PLANNED SHUTDOWNS. I THINK SCHOOLS ARE KIND OF INCLUDED IN THAT THAT LOW'S LIST OF KIND OF PARTNERS WHERE UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO- COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE PARTNERS WHEN THEY'RE PLANNING ON- IMPLEMENTING A SHOT OFF- I DON'T KNOW WHO. THE EXTENT TO WHICH SORT OF THERE'S COMMUNICATION AROUND- BACKUP POWER- AT THOSE FACILITIES MAYBE THE EITHER THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OR UTILITIES CAN KIND OF SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THOSE DETAILS BUT ANOTHER AT LEAST ON THE WEST OF KIND OF- OF ENSURING THAT THERE'S COMMUNICATION BETWEEN UTILITIES IN THOSE FACILITIES. THANK YOU IN AND I REALIZE THERE MAY BE OTHERS BETTER EQUIPPED TO ANSWER SOME OF THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- BUT REPRESENTING LARGELY RURAL AREAS I THINK- RESIDENTS IN RURAL AREAS FACE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAN THOSE IN URBAN AREAS- IN THE RECENT SHUT DOWN THERE WERE SOME- RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE SALINAS VALLEY. WHO WEREN'T PROVIDED WITH ANY SUPPORT FOR RESOURCE CENTERS FOR CHARGING CELL PHONES FOR COMMUNICATIONS- THEY WERE LEFT HIGH AND DRY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. HOW WE PUT THOSE HOLES MOVING FORWARD- MAY I BE THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS DíAS. IF WE CAN. CHECK CAN SAVE LIVES WITH A PROACTIVE FOCUSED ENERGY SHUT DOWN NOBODY'S GONNA STAND IN THE WAY OF DOING THAT BUT WHAT TODAY'S HEARING I THINK IS LARGELY FOCUSED ON HIS WHAT ARE THE PROTOCOLS AND WHAT ARE THE COMMUNICATION ACCORDANCE AND WHAT IS THE VOICE OF CAL FIRE- WE S. IN THE STATE WORKING WITHTHE PRIVATE UTILITIES- IN THAT COORDINATION SO. IS MY CALLING SAID SO WE'RE USING A SCALPEL IN NOT A SLEDGE HAMMER THE STAKES ARE INCREDIBLY HIGH AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN UNDERESTIMATE THE NEXUS OF CLIMATE CHANGE OF DROUGHT OF LOW HUMIDITY AND HIGH WIND EVENTS THAT ARE UNPRECEDENTED. THAT SAID. THEY DON'T COME AS A SURPRISE THEY'VE BEEN PREDICTED- WE'VE SUFFERED THEM OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND IT'S TIME TO STEP UP. OR COORDINATED RESPONSE TO PROTECT HUMAN LIFE. AND RELIABILITY WITH. THE COMMUNICATION ASPECT IS ONE THAT'S GOING TO RESULT IN THE LOSS OF LIFE IF IT'S NOT PART OF THE COORDINATED RESPONSE SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COUPLE QUESTIONS IN A STATEMENT BUT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE. LISTEN SIXTY SECONDS THERE ONE MORE WELL LEGISLATION WILL TAKE EFFECT- AS OF JANUARY HI NOW- TELECOM COMPANIES HAVE TO INFORM AFTER TRIGGERED EUGENE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES WITHIN ONE HOUR OF. NINE ONE ONE GOING DOWN THAT WOULD INCLUDE BOTH LANE CELL PHONES I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR REDUNDANT POWER FOR BOTH CELL TOWERS IN THE STATE- IS WELL AS LAND MINE OPERATING CENTERS AND BE VERY INTERESTED WHEN THE DIRECTOR FROM THE OFFICE MOODY'S SERVICES FOR YOU OF COURSE MISTER CHAIR. COMES UP- LIKE TO HEAR HIS POINT OF VIEW ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A GROWING CONCERN IS A CENTER MONIES ELOQUENTLY POINTED OUT AND AT DEEPLY CONCERNED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. CENTER STERN. FAMOUS CHAIR MISTER BROWN I JUST WANT TO GET A LITTLE MORE A GRANULAR FEEDBACK ON THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'VE APPROPRIATED. AS ANY THAT MONEY GOING OUT THE DOOR YET. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY ARE WELL I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION THE ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE ABLE ABLE TO US THE KIND OF ANSWER THAT QUESTION PROBLEM MORE DEFINITIVELY THAN I AM I KNOW THAT THEY'VE DETERMINED THAT THE BUCKETS OF THAT WILL BE USED BY A PART OF THAT MONEY- IS JUST KIND OF AUTOMATICALLY- ALLOCATED BASED ON A FORMULA A PART OF IT I THINK THERE'S SOME APPLICATION PROCESS FOR PROVIDING THAT MONEY- I DID JUST SPEAK MOSTLY I THINK MY COMMENTS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PEACE I WILL SAY FOR THE- STATE GOVERNMENT PEACE HALF OF THE MONEY WILL GO TO STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS AND OUR STANDING AS- THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT YET DETERMINED HOW THAT MONEY WILL BE SPENT YET SO THAT'S NOT. GONE OUT A AND WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON THE NEXT PANEL IN YOUR VIEW IS THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE THIS LAST UDGET YEAR SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS. THE OVERALL SCOPE OF BACKUP POWER NEEDS STATEWIDE. I MEAN I THINK. IF WE'RE GOING IF I WERE EXPECTING SIMILAR LEVELS OF OFFENSE GOING FORWARD THEN. YOUR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR BACKUP GENERATION FOR. ALL AFFECTED CUSTOMERS IS PROBABLY. YOU KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR THAT I GUESS YOU KNOW THERE'S KIND OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AROUND. NO ONE WHICH CASES SHOULD. CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE STATE BUDGET- HELP FIND THOSE TYPES OF BACKUP GENERATION- AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER AMERICANS. THANK YOU- A QUICK QUESTION AND- CERTAINLY MISTER BROWN IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO ANSWER THIS IT'S A IT WILL BE ON BOARD FOR THE CPUC TO ANSWER WHEN THEY COME UP. SO IN LINE WITH YOUR REPORT AND PAGE THREE WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT THE POST OF IT REPORT WITHIN TEN DAYS. ARE YOU AWARE OF WE HAVE RECEIVED THIS REPORT FROM THE LAST MAJOR EVENT. THAT TALKS ABOUT THE POST EVENT REPORT. THERE'S A VARIETY OF REPORTS FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT UTILITIES OUT THE POST EVENT REPORTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ISSUED TEN DAYS AFTER THOSE EVENTS THAT ARE POSTED ON P. UC'S WEBSITE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR FOR THE FINAL EVENTS WHETHER THOSE HAVE BEEN. POSTED AT THE MOST RECENT EVENTS WHETHER THOSE HAVE BEEN POSTED YET BUT I KNOW FOR- A LOT OF THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED THROUGHOUT OCTOBER THERE ARE THOSE POSTERS AND REPORTS FROM THE UTILITIES THAT ARE POSTED ON THE- ON THE PC WEBSITE. OKAY THANK YOU AND. ALSO THE REFERENCE ON PAGE FOUR OF. GENERATORS AND BACKUP AVAILABLE FOR SOME FACILITIES NOT THE UTILITIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE GENERATORS FOR EVERYTHING. BUT SOME FACILITIES. ARE I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MEANS- HOSPITALS OR PUBLIC SAFETY TYPE FACILITIES. AND YET- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE I REMEMBER AN ARTICLE. OF A WOMAN WHO DIDN'T HAVE OXYGEN- AVAILABILITY. AND CONTACTED A LOCAL HOSPITAL AND WAS TOLD WE CAN'T HELP YOU SO. I THAT WAS PARTICULARLY DISTURBING AND I KNOW THAT'L COME UP DURING THE- LATER PANELS IN TERMS OF HEALTH FACILITIES AND- AVAILABILITY BUT WE GOT TO CONNECT THE DOTS ON- IF THIS IS A- RESPONSIBILITY. HOW ARE WE CLOSING THE GAP ON THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES AND DETERMINING WHAT FACILITIES. I NEED TO HAVE THAT OUT REACH TO GET THOSE THERE. AGAIN YOU GAVE US THE OF THE- FRAMEWORK AND THOSE QUESTIONS WILL COME UP LATER AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET SOME RESPONSES. PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE STORIES WE HEARD. THANK YOU. CENTER RUBIO. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE EIGHT POSITIONS ARE YOU KNOW YOU STATED HERE AT THAT TIME I WAS SATISFIED FUNDING ONE POINT THREE MILLION SS I PRAY pREFERENCES ON PAGE SIX THAT. THE POSITIONS ARE GOING TO DEVELOP CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING THE PROGRAM AND ENSURING THAT YOU TWENTY COORDINATE WITH FIRST RESPONDERS. I WANT TO ADDRESS WITH MUCH MONIES AND WHICH I BELIEVE IS REALLY IMPORTANT JOB WHAT IS THE REQUIREMENT TERMS OF THEIR EXPERTISE. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN AREAS LIKE MISTER MINE IS DIFFERENT THAN MINE ARE THEY GOING OUT ACROSS. CALIFORNIA TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. I'M SORRY. JUST TO CLARIFY THAT PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION GOING OUT THERE TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS. I MEAN THERE ARE AGAIN PROBABLY OVER ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF COMMENT ON ON WHAT THEIR CAPACITY IS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING EXACTLY AND I THINK. THEY CLEARLY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS. A GAP IN RESOURCES AVAILABLE- PRIOR TO THIS YEAR- AND SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE IN KIND OF STAFFING UP AND WHERE THOSE A POSITIONS ARE. RIGHT NOW I DO I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THEY- RECEIVE SOME FUNDING FOR CONTRACTS AND SO I THINK THEY'RE DOING SOME CONTRACTING WITH SOME- THIRD PARTY ENTITIES TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR- OVERSIGHT AND PROCESS SEES FOR TRYING TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THE CHALLENGES ARE AND HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES- BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY. BETTER ABLE TO SPEAK TO KIND OF WHERE THEY ARE IN THAT PROCESS. I WILL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TRYING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU. OKAY WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT A PRESENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER BROWN. WITH WE CAN ASK CAROLYN LYNN THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF SENSE AND SEND YOU GAS AND ELECTRIC TO COME FORWARD ALONG WITH PHIL HARRINGTON THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND BILL JOHNSON WELL THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER PRESIDENT PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. ALSO IF WE CAN ASK LAURIE JIM MONA. WITH THE. ALSO WITH THE PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC CO SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT CHIEF CUSTOMER OFFICER. AND SOON MEET SITTING THE VICE PRESIDENT BASS AT RISK MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE SAFETY PROGRAMS. SENATE. SO WE HAVE THE FIRST THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE OKAY. MULTIPLE FULL HUMAN VISUALLY THE RIGHT THE PLAN. OKAY. THEN WE'LL HEAR FIRST FROM US AND YOU GAS AND ELECTRIC. IN WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CAROLINE WHEN AND I AM THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC AND TO MY RIGHT IS GOT KREIDER WHO'S OUR VICE PRESIDENT CUSTOMER SERVICES AND TO MY LEFT IS JOHN JENKINS WHO'S OUR VICE PRESIDENT ELECTRIC SYSTEM OPERATIONS WITH MUCH OF THE WILD FIRE AT RESPONSIBILITIES WITHIN HIM. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE PUBLIC POWER SAFETY SHUT OFF PROGRAM. AS A WILDFIRE PREVENTION MEASURE. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IT ES DE JEANNIE WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOME. OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERS AND THE CPC COMMISSIONERS TO REDUCE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. AS WE CONTINUE ADDRESSING THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES TOGETHER. WE RECOGNIZE THE DISRUPTIONS THAT POWER SHUT OFF BECAUSE AND CAN HAVE ON EVERYDAY LIVES. ON SCHOOLS ON BUSINESSES. A LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND ESPECIALLY THE VULNERABLE POPULATION INCLUDING THE ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH SPECIAL MEDICAL CARE NEEDS. AND WHILE WE CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM EVERY P. S. P. S. EVENT THAT WE HAVE. WE MAKE IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON THE FEEDBACK NOT JUST FROM OUR EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS MORE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO. OUR WELFARE MITIGATION PROGRAM HAS GONE THROUGH MANY ITERATIONS AS WE INCORPORATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW PROCESS SEES. BUT THE FUNDAMENTALS FOR US HAVE NOT CHANGED. AND THE REALLY FOUR PILLARS THAT WE FOCUS ON. THE FIRST ONE IS FOR CASTING FIRE DANGER. ONLY OURS BUT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS. AT SO THAT WE CAN PLAN AHEAD. WE CAN PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES. AND I JUST OPERATIONS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK AND RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES EFFECTIVELY. NUMBER TWO IS HARDENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN FIRE PRONE AREAS. TO BETTER WITHSTAND THE EXTREME CONDITIONS AND DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO TARGET AND TAYLOR NARAL OUTAGES ONLY TO THE MOST ENDANGERED COMMUNITIES. NUMBER THREE IS OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF SHUT UP THROUGH BROAD CUSTOMER OUTREACH AND PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND THE LAST ONE IS SERVICE RESTORATION AFTER A P. S. P. S. EVENT. NOW LET ME ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS AT HAND. THERE WERE FOUR SANTA ANA RED FLAG EVENTS IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. THREE OF THEM WERE BACK TO BACK IN THE LAST WEEK AND A HALF OF THE MONTH. OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WAS OPEN TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN. MONITORING WHETHER IN GREAT CONDITIONS FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT. AT THE HEIGHT OF THE BAND'S AROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WERE IMPACTED WITH THE AVERAGE OUT OF DURATION OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS. WELL THE WINDS WERE SEVERE. FORTUNATELY AND ALL THE EVENTS THEY DIDN'T LAST LONG. WE SAW TYPICAL WIND SPEEDS CONSISTENLY BLOWING AROUND TWENTY TO THIRTY MILES PER HOUR AND PEAKING AT ABOUT EIGHTY MILES PER HOUR IN OUR HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN WEATHER STATIONS RECORDED ALL TIME PEAK WIND GUSTS. OUR SYSTEM HELD UP WELL GIVEN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THERE WERE NO MAJOR FIRES IN OUR REGION. IN TERMS OF LEFT LESSONS LEARNED. AFTER EACH PS PS OF THAT. IT IS OUR STANDARD PRACTICE TOGETHER FEEDBACK AGAIN NOT JUST FROM EMPLOYEES. BUT ALSO OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PUBLIC AGENCIES AND OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. ONE LESSON THAT WE LEARNED IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE EVEN TIGHTER OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS WITH OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS. THIS IS SO THAT THEY CAN DEPLOY RESOURCES EVEN MORE RAPIDLY MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE AND MORE AND BROADLY TO HELP SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY POWER SHUT OFFS. ANOTHER LESSON IS WILL THAT WE LEARNED IS THE WIDESPREAD NEED FOR BACKUP GENERATORS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A PILOT OF SOLAR BATTERY GENERATORS FOR MEDICAL BASED ON CUSTOMERS. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY RELY ON THESE LIFE SUSTAINING DEVICES. AND THE INITIAL FEEDBACK FROM OUR PROGRAM IS VERY POSITIVE HOWEVER IT'S QUITE LIMITED IN SCOPE AT THIS POINT. IT'S CLEAR THAT MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS NOT JUST THOSE THAT ARE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS ARE INTERESTED IN OBTAINING GENERATORS. AND WE ARE IN EARLY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AS TO HOW WE CAN CREATE A BULL GENERATOR PROGRAM. IN ADDITION WE'RE EXPLORING WERE MAKES SENSE FOR US TO BUILD. MICHAEL GRITS TO KEEP OUR KEY COMMUNITY FACILITIES OR CORD DOWNTOWN AREAS OPERATING DURING POWER SHUT OFF SUCH AS WHAT WE DID IN THE TOWN OF JULIAN. WELL AS THE GENIE CONTINUOUSLY INVEST AND HARDENING ARE INFRASTRUCTURE WE KNOW THAT OUR WORK TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE AND THE IMPACT TO OUR CUSTOMERS IS NEVER DONE. OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR. POWER SHUT OFF THROUGH A STRATEGIC COMBINATION AND PORTFOLIO PROJECTS INCLUDING STRATEGICALLY UNDER GROUNDING. INCLUDING THE USE OF IT A CONDUCTOR THAT'S COVERED WITH NON CONDUCTIVE MATERIALS. INCLUDING ADDING MORE SEXUAL ISING DEVICES AND MORE BACK UP GENERATOR SOLUTIONS. WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO EXPAND OF FALLING CONDUCTOR PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL PREVENT BROKEN WIRES FROM BECOMING AN IGNITION SOURCE. OUR ENGINEERS HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO CUT OFF POWER TO A BROKEN WIRE BEFORE IT EVEN HITS THE GROUND ESSENTIALLY BEING GRAVITY. AND THIS WILL DETECT AND SHUT OFF POWER IN ABOUT ONE SECOND TIME FRAME. NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOING TO BE OPENING OF FIRE SCIENCE AND INNOVATION LAB WHICH WILL BRING TOGETHER LEADING THINKERS. AND PROBLEM SOLVERS N ACADEMIA. AND GOVERNMENT. AND THE COMMUNITY TO CREATE FORWARD LOOKING SOLUTIONS. THAT WILL HELP PREVENT IGNITIONS. MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF FIRES AND ULTIMATELY HELP BUILD A MORE RESILIENT REGION. AN ADDITIONAL AREAS WHERE WE NEED RELIEF THAT LAND OUTSIDE OF THE TO LEASE CONTROLS INCLUDE STANDARDS FOR NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS. AND STREAMLINED CONSTRUCT ABILITY PERMITTING AND STREAMLINED AND A LINE STATE AND FEDERAL. ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS. SO IN CLOSING OUR COMMITMENT TO THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE IS UNWAVERING. MOVING FORWARD SB JANIE WILL CONTINUE WORKING DILIGENTLY AT THE BROAD RANGE OF UTILITY SERVICES THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH FIRE WEATHER EVENTS SUCH AS AGGRESSIVE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. WEATHER DATA AND EVENT PREDICTABILITY. ALSO SHARPENING OUR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND FINALLY IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AROUND CUSTOMER AND COMMUNITY COMMUNICATIONS. I'M CERTAIN WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW UP TO IMPROVE. EACH OF THESE AREAS. BUT I THINK WHAT'S NEED IN CALIFORNIA. IS THE THINK BEYOND OURSELVES. THIS MOMENT IS CALLING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. PS PS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT'S NEXT. I'VE SAID AN APP ASPIRATIONAL GOAL FOR OUR ORGANIZATION. NOT ONLY TO REDUCE OR MITIGATE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES BUT HOW DO WE ELIMINATED. AND I KNOW THIS IS A LOFTY THING TO SAY BUT IT S. P. JEANNIE. THAT IS OUR NORTH STAR. AND WE ABSOLUTELY ARE WORKING TOWARDS THAT. I APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU'VE ALLOWED ABOUT ME TODAY AND WE'RE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. I JUSTWANT TO ASK YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE NO MAJOR FIRES WHERE THEIR FIRES YES THERE WERE FIRES AND HOW DO YOU DEFINE A MAJOR FIRE VERSES OF. OF WHAT WE TALKING WITH BRUSH FIRES WILL YEAH- I AM LIKE THERE THAT CATASTROPHIC FIRES OKAY SO WE DID HAVE FIRES- WHERE PROP PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS LOST DIRECT WERE THERE ANY LOSS OF LIFE. NO NOT THAT I KNOW. OKAY DO DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION TERMS OF MANY STRUCTURES WERE AFFECTED BY THE FIRES- THERE WAS A FIRE IN RAMONA WHICH I HAVE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO CALIFORNIA WHO IS ON THAT VERY QUICKLY. AND I DON'T RECALL HOW MANY STRUCTURES WERE DAMAGE I BELIEVE SOME OF IT MAY HAVE BEEN SOME OUT STRUCTURES LIKE BARNES AND- THINGS OF THAT NATURE THERE'S ANOTHER FIRE VALLEY CENTER DURING THAT TIME FRAME. HAS A BUTTON TO DO AS A BEEN DETERMINE WHAT THE CAUSE OF THOSE FIRES WAS. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE OKAY- CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU- SO YOU INDICATED THAT YOUR- AVERAGE POWER SHUT OFF TIME WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND WE KNOW THAT IN THE DE. REGION THAT MIGHT BY ARE YOU SERVICE IT WAS LONGER. AND THERE WERE- AS FAR AS I KNOW FROM LOOKING AT THE- WINDS DATA HERE THE WIND- THE HIGH WIND SPEEDS DID LAST LONGER IN THE IN SME OF P. GENIES UTILITY AREA SO THAT MIGHT. EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME BUT COULD YOU JUST ASK LEVERETT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON HOW YOU WERE ABLE TO CHIEF A WITH THERE WERE OTHER FACTORS BESIDES WIND SPEED THAT ALLOWED YOU TO ACHIEVE A SHORTER DURATION OF AN OUTAGE AND ADDITIONALLY- HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO WHAT IT WOULD APPEAR. IS MORE SURGICAL- IN OTHER WORDS LESS CUSTOMERS CLEARLY YOUR SERVICE AREA IS SMALLER YOU HAVE LESS CUSTOMERS BUT AS A PROPORTION YOU STILL TURN THE POWER OFF OF A PROPORTIONATELY FEWER SERVE YOU COULD JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE ON WHAT ENABLED YOU TO DO THAT YOUR- I ARE YOU. YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I WOULD FIRST START WITH THE LAST PART OF YOUR QUESTION THAT IS THAT- SINCE YOU THE DEVASTATING FIRES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN- WE NOT ONLY HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON TRYING TO FORECAST FIRE DANGER. BUT ALSO HARDENER INFRASTRUCTURE AND PART OF HARDENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE OF THE HOUSE BUT LOWER VOLTAGE SIDE. WE HAVE BEEN. A THOUGHTFUL ABOUT INSTALLING SECTION LICENSE WHICH IS AND WHAT THAT'S ABLE TO DO IS ONLY LIMIT. UP A SHOT OFF TO KIND OF THAT THE MOST ENDANGERED COMMUNITIES. SO WE PAIR ARE SECTION LICENSE WHICH WITH THE WEATHER STATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES SOME OF THE CIRCUITRY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR BACK COUNTRY IS IN OVER A HUNDRED CIRCUIT MILES LONG. AND THAT NGUYEN CONDITION IN ONE PART OF A CIRCUIT COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN A WIN CONDITION IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CIRCUIT. SO PUTTING MULTIPLE WEATHER STATIONS ON A CIRCUIT AND PAIRING IT WITH THE SEXUAL LICENSE WHICH HAS PROVED TO BE A GOOD PRACTICE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE SURGICAL AND HOW WE- ARE ABLE TO SHUT OFF A MORE NARROWLY. WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PATROL BEAT TO WE DO A 100% PATROLLING OF A POWER LINE AFTER WE TURN OFF THE SERVICE. AND THE REASON THAT WE DO THAT IS BECAUSE WE CAN FIND DAMAGE TO THAT CIRCUITRY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE BEFORE WE RE ENERGIZE THAT CIRCUIT THAT THERE'S NO DAMAGE TO START ANOTHER FIRE. SO WE DO A 100% PATROLS ON THE CIRCUIT AND WE DO THAT EITHER BY FOOT PATROL OR BY CAR OR BY HELICOPTER THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO PUT A HELICOPTER IN THE AIR. AND SOMETIMES THE WIND IS STILL TOO HIGH FOR US TO GET A HELICOPTER IN THE AIR SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT GO INTO THE TIME FRAME IT TAKES US TO PATROL. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN SAN DIEGO SERVICE TERRITORY. THE WINDS WERE OF A SHORTER DURATION SO WE WERE ABLE TO MANEUVER OUR RESOURCES ON THE GROUND AS WELL AS THE HELICOPTER **** THAT WE HAD IN THE AIR. TO BE ABLE TO WORK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO RESTORE. SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ALSO I JUST WANTED TO. THANK YOU FOR COURT COURT NADINE INFORMATION WITH OUR OFFICE WE GOT- WE WERE- FACING A DAY LUCIEN CALLS FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS AND A GROUP. THAT INFORMATION WAS VERY HELPFUL TO US TO COMMUNICATING WITH THEM. BUT ALSO WHEN AND BEING RESPONSIVE TO THEIR NEEDS. I DID HERE IN THE WITH THE WITH THE STATE OF RADIO STATION AND I TUNED IN TO THAT STATION AND I HEARD THAT THEY WERE COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE THAT WERE CALLING IN. AND EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTIFIED IN THE TAPE THAT THEY HAD NOT ABSENCE OF INFORMATION. COULD YOU BRIEFLY- MAYBE TALK ABOUT. WHAT YOUR IN THE PROTOCOLS ARE IN TERMS OF INFORMING THE PUBLIC OF THE- OF THE- SHUT OFFS. AND IF YOU THINK THAT IT WOULD BE PRUDENT AND THE WORK ON THE FUTURE TO COOK COORDINATED WITH SOME. RADIO STATION. A TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND HOW THERE THERE BUT NOT NOT ONLY THE POWER COULD BE AFFECTED BUT HOW WHERE THEY CAN GO TO GET SERVICES I KNOW IN JULIAN FOR EXAMPLE THE POWER WAS KEPT ON THE POOR AND COURAGE TO GO THERE TO- GET HELP AND HAVE A PLACE TO STAY WHERE THEY CAN SPEND THE DAY- OR OR MAYBE EVEN GET ACCESS TO ICE TO KEEP THAT IN THEIR FREEZER SO THEY CAN KEEP THEIR FOOD PROTECTED. CAN YOU MAY BE A COMMENT ON WHETHER YOU WORK WITH RADIO STATIONS CAN THAT BE DONE IN THE FUTURE OR WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL THAT YOU FOLLOW THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR HUESO I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION LET YOU KNOW THAT THE TWO FIRES I MENTION WERE NOT UTILITY COSTS SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I CLARIFIED THAT- I WILL TELL YOU THAT IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS. WE THE GREAT NEWS ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY VERSES WHERE WE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IS WE NOW HAVE DATA SO WE HAVE OVER TEN YEARS NOW OF REALLY WHICH RICH WEATHER DATA WHICH HELPS OUR METEOROLOGIST BE ABLE TO FORECAST WHEN AN EVENT IS COMING SO SEVEN TO TEN DAYS IN ADVANCE I'M GETTING NOTIFICATION THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A SANTA ANA RED FLAG AND CERTAINLY AS THE MODELS RUN TWICE A DAY. WE GET MORE MORE CERTAINTY AS YOU GET CLOSER SO I WOULD TELL YOU THAT CUSTOMERS ARE NOTIFIED STARTING AT FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND THEN AGAIN AT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND THEN WE TRY OUR BEST TO DO THE ONE TO FOR OUR COMMUNICATIONS DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO DO SO BUT OUR GOAL IS THAT NO CUSTOMERS WILL BE SURPRISED WE WANT OUR CUSTOMERS BE ABLE TO PLAN THEIR LIVES TO PLAN THEIR BUSINESSES TO PLAN AROUND SCHOOLS AND SO THAT'S THE THAT'S- A MAIN REASON THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT SURPRISED. BUT EVEN BEFORE YOU GET IT WE GET INTO A VAN I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT CUSTOMER OUT REACHING AND PUBLIC OUR AND PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS IT'S A YEAR ROUND OF AT THE TIME TO COMMUNICATE TO CUSTOMERS. IS NOT DURING AN EMERGENCY IT'S ALL ACROSS. THE YEAR SO THIS PAST SUMMER WE HELD. EIGHT COMMUNITY RESILIENT FAIRS AND WILDFIRE OPEN HOUSES IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE MOST IMPACTED. SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN GO AND GET INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO BE PREPARED FOR A POWER OUTAGE WHETHER IT'S A P. S. P. S. OR ANY OTHER POWER OUTAGE. AND ALSO. WE HAVE SENT OUR SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM OUT TO DO TOWN HALLS AFTER PS PS EVENTS IN THE MOST IMPACTED AREAS. FOR ONE REASON FOR US TO LISTEN TO CUSTOMERS LISTEN TO THEIR EXPERIENCES THAT THEY HAVE. SO THAT WE CAN HELP SUPPORT THEM. SO IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION AROUND RADIO STATIONS I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE SENT OUR DIRECTOR. OF FIRE SCIENCE AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION TO ALL THE TELEVISION STATIONS TO. TALK ABOUT THE UPCOMING. SANTA ANA RED FLAG EVENTS SO THAT THERE IS A MUCH BROADER. COMMUNICATION ON TELEVISION AND YOUR SUGGESTION ABOUT RADIO IS ALSO GOOD ON THAT WE WILL TAKE BACK AND SEE IF WE CAN EVEN DO MORE IN THAT AREA AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A TELEVISION DURING THE EVENT MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSISTORIZED AB THAT COULD BE SOME. ADVERTISED IN THE FUTURE- CENTER WILK THE ONE. THING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY ACTUALLY IS VERY VERY IMPRESSED BY IT THAT WAS JUST KIND OF STRUCK SO WE HAVE ALL THESE MONOPOLIES YOU'RE NOT DIRECT COMPETITORS IN THAT RESPECT. SO IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES DO YOU ALL BETWEEN THE I. O. USED YOU GUYS SHARE YOUR BEST PRACTICES WITH THE WITH ONE ANOTHER AS WELL AS WITH THE C. P. U. C. SO. OUR RATE PAYERS GET THE BEST SERVICES DELIVER TEST AS POSSIBLE. YES SENATOR WILK WE GET TOGETHER WITH A JOINT. I OWE YOU PROGRAM WHERE WE SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND NOT ONLY ARE WE SHARING WHAT IS WORKING WITH US IT YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY BUT WE'RE LEARNING ALSO FROM P. JEANNIE IN EDISON ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND SEEING HOW WE CAN INCORPORATE THAT INTO. OUR E. S. P. S. AND FIRE WEATHER EVENTS. SERRA KIDS. WELL LET ME START BY THANK YOU FOR KEEPING ME UPDATED AS WELL I GOT TEXT MESSAGES MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE SANTA ANA WINDS ABOUT ALL OF THE COUNTY- AND MY AREA WAS NOT IMPACTED SO I APPRECIATE THAT- GOING BACK I GUESS I HAVE ONE QUESTION. WHEN WE EXPERIENCE THE FIRES ARE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN- I GUESS I WANT TO KNOW IN TERMS OF WHERE WAS THE MOMENT WHERE YOU REALIZE YOU HAD TO LOOK AT YOUR- HARDENING AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND DID YOU AT THAT POINT DEVELOP A PLAN BASED ON THAT AND- I OBVIOUSLY WAS A GREAT EXPENSE ON THE FRONT END TO START TO DO THIS WORK. AND THEN OF COURSE THE URBAN INTERFACE BECAUSE WE HAD WHO ARE OURS WAS URBAN WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT RANCHO BERNARDO FRENCH OPEN SKATERS THOSE AREAS UP THERE- AND LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE MAYBE THE UTILITIES NEED TO BE UNDERGROUND AND WE HAVE A NETWORK OF URBAN CANYONS. ARE THE GO RIGHT INTO THE HEART OF OUR CITY AND WE'VE HAD MAJOR FIRES ALONG THOSE CANYON RAMS. THE FIRE LONG AGO ON THE RAM OF THOUGHT MISSION VALLEY OF A NORMAL HEIGHTS- IT DATE COULD AT I WANTED TO I KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CONVERSATION BUT IN TERMS OF. THAT DECISION AND THE RESOURCES TO GO TOWARDS THAT HARDENING- YOUR PLAN THEN AS YOU STARTED AND WHERE YOU ARE NOW- IN TERMS OF THE WORK YOU STILL HAVE TO DO CAN YOU COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ON. ON THAT PLAN. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS- THE DEVASTATING FIRES IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WAS A MUCH BROADER POPULATION IMPACTED AND IT BECAME PERSONAL ALL OF US. THIS WORK SHOULD THERE BE THREE EVACUATION THROUGH FRIENDS OR FAMILY OR EMPLOYEES THAT LOST THEIR HOMES- SO IT BECAME PERSONAL FOR US AND I WOULD HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT POST TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE DNA THE COMPANY CHANGED IT REALLY CHANGE FROM A CULTURE OF% KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON WHICH WE'VE BEEN VERY PROUD OF TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. N. WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE CULTURE IT'S NOT A TOP DOWN CULTURE IT WELL OURS FROM THE CEO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO OUR EMPLOYEES ARE ALL IN. BUT IT'S ALSO BOTTOMS UP WE HAVE LONG TERM EMPLOYEES THAT ARE FIELD WORKERS THAT WERE ALSO IMPACTED AND THEY'RE ALSO GIVING US IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN MAKE OUR GRID EVEN SAFER. SO I REALLY FEEL THAT FROM A FROM A COMPANY AND A CULTURE PERSPECTIVE THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. AND SO I WOULD JUST TELL YOU HAVING GONE THROUGH THOSE EXPERIENCES AND HAVING SEEN THE CULTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION CHANGE IN FRONT OF MY EYES. IT IT THAT WAS THE FIRE THAT ACTUALLY CHANGE THE DNA EVER COMPANY AND WERE AND EVERYONE HAS BEEN ALL IN. AND I WOULD SAY THE FIRST THING WE STARTED TO DO WAS HARDEN OUR TRANSMISSION LINES SO THAT WE CAN KIND OF KEEP THOSE ELECTRIC SUPER HIGHWAYS- YOU KNOW SAFE AND NOT HAVING TO TURN THEM OFF IF. THERE IS THE HIGH WEATHER EVENTS THEN WE GOT INTO OUR METEOROLOGY AND WE STARTED PUTTING IN THESE WEATHER STATIONS BUT BACK AT THAT TIME I WOULD TELL YOU THAT THERE IS REALLY NO PRESCRIPTIVE PLAN AS TO HOW WE SHOULD. DESIGN ENGINEER CONSTRUCTOR EVEN MAINTAIN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST THE INCREASINGLY VIOLENT THREAT OF WILDFIRES. THERE WASN'T A BLUEPRINT ON THE WEATHER NETWORK SO IT JUST BECAME ONE DECISION TO ANOTHER DECISION TO ANOTHER DECISION AND- YOU KNOW I'M I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THE OF ALL FORTY TWO HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AT OUR COMPANY INCLUDING. OF SCOTT AND JOHN AND NOT THE REMAINING FOUR THOUSAND ALWAYS WE HAVE OUR COMPANY THEY'RE VERY FOCUSED ON. ON MAKING THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES. SCOTT WOULD LIKE ANYTHING. THANK YOU. IN CENTER AND UNITES AT C. PROBABLY THE YOU KNOW THAT THE REAL THE OTHER AREA IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO INCREASE THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS SO. YOU KNOW FOR US WE'VE BEEN DOING PS PS LIKE ADVANCE BEFORE WAS CALLED PS PS EVENT- PS PS FOR NUMBER OF YEARS. AND I THINK THAT YOU EIGHT YOU KNOW IS A YOU KNOW WE'VE EXPERIENCED IT WAS NOT EASY AT FIRST YOU KNOW SO THIS IS REALLY TAKEN A LOT OF WORK OF WORKING WITH. STRUCTURE RURAL COMMUNITIES- WHETHER IT'S JULIANNE OR VALLEY CENTER OR CAMPO TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME. AS CAROLINE SAID HE ACTUALLY HAVING OUR OFFICERS GO OUT THERE AND SPEND TIME WITH WITH WITH THE COMMUNITIES- MEANS UNDERSTANDING KIND OF THE NEEDS OF OUR OF OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN IN SAN DIEGO AS WELL. AND SO THE I THINK THE EVOLUTION OF OUR WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITIES- IT HAS HIS ALSO IMPROVED AND REALLY WHAT WE VIEW IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BE EFFECTIVE THIS THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS. TO OUR PARTNERS YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAP INTO- ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS NETWORK WORKING GROUP THAT THROUGH THE COUNTY. TO REALLY START TO EXPAND OUR OUT REACH. INTO A YOU KNOW TO THESE THAT SENSITIVE POPULATIONS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS. AND WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE- WITH THE RED CROSS WHETHER IT'S TWO ONE ONE SAN DIEGO MEALS ON WHEELS WE RECOGNIZE AS A COMPANY- LONG AGO THAT WE CANNOT DO THIS ON OUR OWN. SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO EXPAND THOSE PARTNERSHIPS SPECIAL WITH THOSE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO ALLOW US TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN REACHING OUT TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPORTING THEM. AND LASTLY IN ME JUST AS THIS IS MUCH SHORTER- I BELIEVE I RECALL AT LEAST SEVERAL DRILLS. THAT INCLUDED ALL OF OUR ALL OF YOUR PARTNERS THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO FIRST RESPONDERS FIRE POLICE. HOW OFTEN DO YOU ENGAGE IN THAT THAT TYPE OF OVERALL. COUNTY WIDE DRILL ARE YOU. STILL DOING THAT LET JOHN JENKINS INCIDENT. THANK YOU CENTER YEAH WE CONDUCT AT LEAST AN ANNUAL DRILL WE INVOLVE ALL THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND GO THROUGH THE EVENTS AND THEN. ALSO JUST GOING TO SAY THAT IN THE ACTUAL VANS WERE VERY GOOD A PARTNERING WITH PEOPLE WE HAVE MEMBERS OF CALLAWAY YES AND COUNTY AS COUNTY- YES THAT COME INTO OUR FACILITY. AND ARE PART OF OUR TEAM HELPING US RESPOND TO THE SITUATION. WE ALSO GO AROUND AND MEET WITH WITH FIRE AGENCIES ON A MONTHLY BASIS BUT THE FIRE CHIEFS I IN PERSON. AND REALLY ARE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER TO- MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF THESE EVENTS TO OUR POPULATIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU I WANT TO DO TO LEARN MORE FOLLOW UP ON THIS HARDENING QUESTION AND THEIR PRO TEMAS APPS SO. OUR C. O. O. FROM SD GENIE YOU REFERENCED. IN THE ARE. IN YOUR I THINK OPENING STATEMENT AROUND SOME OF THE HARDENING THAT YOU ALL ENGAGE IN AND THE PRO TEM REFERENCED UNDER GROUNDING OF THE LINES NOW I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THE UNDERGROUND COMPLIANCE IS QUITE EXPENSIVE PER MILE AND WHEN YOU DESCRIBE SOME OF THE HARDENING THINGS THAT YOU DID YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT SO WHAT WHAT I'M- CURIOUS ABOUT IS. WHAT WERE THE COST EFFECTIVE HARDENING INVESTMENTS THAT YOU MADE. AND THE- THAT MIGHT BE ALTERNATIVE WHICH TO WORK OTHER THAN UNDER GROUNDING AND TO HAVE YOU FOUND THOSE TO BE AS EFFECTIVE POTENTIALLY ADDS UNDERGROUND FOR EXAMPLE. I WOULD TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY REAL 100% FAIL SAFE WAY TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES FROM ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS TO UNDERGROUND HAVING SAID THAT- IF YOU'RE ABLE TO HARDEN YOUR LINES WHICH IS REALLY IN OUR VERNACULAR TO REPLACE OUR WOULD POLLS WITH STEEL POLES. PUT IN LARGER WIRE AND BIGGER SPACING BETWEEN THE WIRES- IF WE'RE ABLE TO INSTALL THIS FALLING CONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY THAT'S ABLE TO EACH SHOT DETECT WHEN A POWER LINE IS BROKEN AND SHUT OFF THE POWER TO THE POWER LINES THAT THE SECTIONAL ICING THAT YOU REFERENCE TO KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THERE THAT YEAH IT SAID. THAT IS UTILIZED ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING THAT OUT BUT IT DOES NEED A HIGH SPEED COMMUNICATION NETWORK SO WE HAVE THAT THOUGH THAT PLAN IN PARALLEL BUT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO DO THE HARDENING. AND THE FOLLOWING CONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY AND EVEN REPLACING SOME OF THE BARE WIRE WITH COVERED CONDUCTOR- WE DO THANK YOU CAN INCREASE THE THEY WIND SPEEDS IN WHICH YOU CAN WITHSTAND. SO WERE YOU REQUIRED TO LOOK AT IN IMPLEMENTED BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES OR WAS THAT A COLLECTIVE ON YOUR PART. AT WITH THE THAT WAS IT JUST THAT WAS OUR MISSION AROUND YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE SET A PLAN THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD NOT BE THE CALLS A LOT A WILDFIRE. SO IT REALLY IS US GETTING TOGETHER IN OUR OPERATIONAL GROUPS AND FIGURED OUT WHAT ARE THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES WEEK WE CAN USE ONE OF THE OPERATING PRACTICES THAT WE CAN USE. AND HOW DO YOU REALLY COMBINE THESE IN LAYER THESE SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CAN WITHSTAND HIGHER AMOUNTS OF WIND WIND SPEEDS. BUT DO YOU CONSIDER THE SECTIONAL RISING THAT YOU DESCRIBED OF FOR THE POWER SHUT OFF. THAT WAS ONE OF YOUR HARDENING ABSOLUTELY HELLO. IN THESE INDIVIDUAL THE- WOULD POLLS REPLACING WITH STEEL THE SECTIONAL RISING AND THE OTHER LINE TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU DESCRIBED. ARE THEY- LESS EXPENSIVE PER UNIT I SUPPOSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER WORD TO USE THAN SAY THE UNDER GROUNDING THE ANSWER IS YES. AND SO. WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT NOW IS NOT ONLY DOING THOSE PORTFOLIO PROJECTS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND STRATEGICALLY UNDERGROUND A WHERE IT MAKES SENSE BUT ALSO THE USE A BACKUP GENERATORS COULD BE A GREAT WAY TO IT IT MITIGATE THE IMPACTS TO CONSUMERS. SO YOU'LL SEE US DO OUR PORTFOLIO THE PROJECTS INCLUDING BACKUP GENERATORS BUT JUST FINALLY THE YOU ALL THAT WAS DONE IN EFFECT ON YOUR OWN. SELECTIVELY VERSUS BY ANY KIND OF DIRECTION YEAH WE WEREN'T MANDATED SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAD- CENTER CHIANG IN THE CENTER STERN. THANK YOU SO AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNDER GROUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE AYE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT FUTURE CATASTROPHES LIKE EARTHQUAKES SO WOULD- UNDERGROUND IN WITH THAT WITHSTAND EARTHQUAKES. YES I BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD WITHSTAND. IT DEPENDS ON OBVIOUSLY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EARTH EARTHQUAKE BUT BUT YES IT IT IS A IT WOULD BE A LA TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO WITHSTAND MORE ENVIRONMENTAL. CONDITIONS THANK YOU. CENTER MORE LUCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MISS WHEN YOU'RE FALLING LINE TECHNOLOGY SOUNDS SIMILAR TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AUSTRALIA- THEY CALL IT POWER DIVERT ERRORS OR A RAPID BIRTH FAULT CURRENT LIMITER SINCE THIS IS THE SAME TECHNOLOGY IT'S A SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY LA JOHN FEEL THAT THAT QUESTION. THE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND THAT'S- BROUGHT PROVIDING A WAY TO. I'D EXTRA SINCE THE PROTECTION FOR YOUR SYSTEM UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND SO WE HAVE A VERSION OF THAT IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY WHERE WHEN WE GET INTO THESE SITUATIONS WE ENABLE ALL OF OUR SMART DEVICES ON OUR SYSTEM. TO GO INTO HYPERSENSITIVE PROTECTED MODE IF YOU WILL AND ACTED THE FASTEST POSSIBLE WAY TO LIMIT THE AMOUNTOF ENERGY THAT CAN BE DISSIPATED- WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS ON THE SYSTEM SO THAT'S MORE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FROM FROM AUSTRALIA THE FALLING CONDUCTOR IS MORE. A CONDUCTOR BREAKS IN THE AIR AND WE DE ENERGIZED BEFORE IT HITS THE GROUND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. BUT THE SENSITIVE PROTECTION AND I DESCRIBES MORE SIMILAR TO A TO WHAT THE REASON IN AUSTRALIA AND DOING OTHER INDEPENDENT RESEARCH I SEE THAT OVERHEAD LINES ARE IMPROVING- WHAT KIND OF OUR PEACE IF YOU PUT OUT TO IMPROVE JUST. THE LINES. ON A ROUTINE MAINTENANCE BASIS WHAT WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH- THREE DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS BIG FOR US WE ALSO ON OUR LINES TO STAY IN THE YEAR ONE AND WITHSTAND HIGH WINDS ONE LISTING CONTACT FROM FLYING DEBRIS- TREE LIMBS. US WE WERE WE WORK WITH THREE MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE A COVER CONDUCTOR THAT HAS TO STEAL STRANDS IN THE MIDDLE TO PROVIDE THE EXTRA STRENGTH- AND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GO FROM A CONDUCTOR THE HOUSE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS OF TINSEL STRENGTH THE FORTY FOUR HUNDRED- SO THAT'S WHEN THE AREAS WERE WORKING WITH MANUFACTURERS TO HELP. INNOVATE AND IMPROVE THE TECHNOLOGY THEIR- MEN LAST QUESTION IS WHEN WILL TWENTY A- WHICH- ALLOWS FOR BEAUTIFICATION SOME UNDER GROUNDING. A BY- THE LAST NUMBERS I HEAR FROM THE CPUC. OR FROM DECEMBER OF FIFTEEN YOU HAD A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION IN RESERVES TO USE THROUGHOUT YOUR IN YOUR AREA. HOUSE HOUSE HAVE BEEN WORKING AS REGARDS TO TRYING. TO BEAUTIFY ONE TO GET SOME OF THESE. WILD FIRES OWN LINES UNDERGROUND. YES PROBABLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE BEEN. WHEN THE TWENTY ETS ARE REALLY THE CITY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE. WHICH LINES THEY WANT TO UNDERGROUND. SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WORKING WITH THEM AND TALKING TO THEM ABOUT. WHERE THE RISKIEST AREAS IN THE IS CITY OR COUNTY WHERE YOU WOULD YOU CAN UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS SO THE CONVERSATION HAS TURNED A LITTLE BIT AND THEY'RE ASKING FOR FEEDBACK AND WE WANT TO GIVE THAT FEEDBACK BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING A MODEL AS WELL BEING- LOOKING AT SOMETHING FOR MOST SEVEN AND MOVING FORWARD SO I JUST WANT TO. COMMEND YOU ON THAT SENATOR WILL DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION I DID DâN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE AND THE PRO CAN FOR OPENING THIS UP FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT SIT ON THE UTILITIES COMMITTEE- BUT I. I HAD A QUESTION- TERMS A MICRO YOUR TALK ABOUT MICRO GRANTS I DON'T SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I SURE WINNER MICHAEL GRADIUS BUT I HEAR ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME IN. A SITUATION WHERE AT A COUPLE COMMUNITIES WITH THAT DIDN'T HAVE A WINDOW THAT THAT WASN'T BY THE FIRE AND THEY WERE TURNED OFF FOR OVER THIRTY HOURS. AND SO THEY HAD NO PHONE BECAUSE IT NO LAND LINES IN THERE'S NO CELL TOWERS THEY HAD NO WATER BECAUSE IN HAVE ENERGY BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S ON A WELL SO I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT. THESE MICRO GRIDS IN IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL OR CAN YOU DESIGN INTO A CERTAIN WAY OR I JUST WANT TO. TAKE THIS INFORMATION BACK FOR OUR NEXT SET OF PANELISTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION A MICRO GRID CAN BE ANY NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGIES FROM GENERATORS TO MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY LIKE SOLAR BATTERIES COMBINED TOGETHER- IN JULIAN WE DO ROLL OUT AGE A GENERATOR WHICH IS CONSIDERED AMICRO GRANT. AND THE- WHAT WE HAD TO DO TO GET JULIAN WHICH IS A COMMUNITY AND OUR MOUNTAINOUS AREAS TO GET THE TOWN A JULIAN WITH ELECTRICITY DURING THESE POWER SHUT OFF IS WITH THERE'S A PAD SETTING FOR THAT GENERATOR AND WE HAD UNDERGROUND. CERTAIN FACILITIES WITHIN THE DOWNTOWN JULIAN AREA IN ORDER FOR THAT TO WORK BUT WE ALSO HAVE A MIKE AGREED IN ERIE THAT WE CALL BORREGO SPRINGS WHICH INCLUDES A SOLAR FOR SENATE FACILITY A GENERATOR. AND A BATTERY SO IT'S ANY NUMBER ONE OF THE. COMBINATIONS THAT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT. A CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ASK YOU ALL JUST STANDARD QUESTION I THINK FOR EVERY UTILITY ON THE PANEL BUT SHE YOU ALL GOING FIRST IN MANY RESPECTS HERE NOT JUST ON PANELS BUT IN TERMS OF GETTING AHEAD OF THIS PS PS RISK WRIT LARGE SO VERY QUICKLY- HOW MANY MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS DO YOU HAVE. GIVE A NUMBER THERE SO IN OUR HEART OUR HIGH FIRED- THREAD AREAS WE HAVE ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND NINETEEN THOUSAND AND OVERALL- DESK I'D I'D HAVE TO GET BACK THE EXACT SO WHEN YOU'RE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND. AND HOW BIG DO YOU THINK THE OVERALL SAY AYE HSS SERVE MEDICALLY VULNERABLE POPULATION IS WITHIN THOSE AREAS LARGER THAN THE NINETEEN THOUSAND I WOULD SAY IT'S CERTAINLY LARGER THAN NINETEEN AT THE INTER POINT IT'S- YOU KNOW WE USE MEDICAL BASS LINE THAT'S THAT'S A RATE THAT OUR CUSTOMER SIGN UP ON BUT WE- FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. MEDICALLY SENSITIVE CUSTOMERS THATPOPULATION GOES FAR BEYOND WHAT OUR MEDICAL BASELINE POPULAR WHAT COULD WHAT DO YOU NEED TO GET TO MORE THOSE PEOPLE YEAH SO YOU KNOW I THINK IN THE ERROR IT IS AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO ABOUT THIS IT'S- YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE SHARE DATA. WHILE STILL PROTECTING CUSTOMER PRIVACY SUPPOSE WE GOT ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE- THAT OCCURS AND- BECAUSE THE COUNTY MAY HAVE OTHER TYPES OF DATABASES AND INFORMATION WHERE WE CAN START TO SINK THOSE TWO UP WHERE. WE KNOW WERE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS ARE- BUT THE COUNTY MAY HAVE OTHER POPULATIONS- ALSO IT'S CONTINUING TO WORK WITH AGAIN WE HAVE A- ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS WORKING GROUP IN THE IN THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. AND THAT'S WORKING WITH THEM TO ALSO UNDERSTANDING WHERE THEIR POPULATIONS ARE BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN- YOU KNOW- GROUPS THAT THEY WORK WITH AND CUSTOMERS AND SO I THINK THROUGH THOSE TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT'S WE'RE GOING TO REALLY BE ABLE TO. IDENTIFY THE AT RISK POPULATIONS AND REALLY TO BUILD BUILD MITIGATION PLANS AROUND. THE IN AND THIS IS AN AREA I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE CAN'T BE GOOD AND OFTEN AND YOU KNOW WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO AMPLIFY OUR MESSAGE. IN THE CHANNELS IN WHICH TUMORS SEE THE INFORMATION AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A PHONE CALL FROM US OR AN EMAIL OR TEXT FROM US. SO AS SCOTT MENTIONED IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE VERY TIGHT CONNECTIONS WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE A. F. AND WORKING GROUP WHICH- YOU KNOW I KNOW OUR ORGANIZATION HAD OVER FIFTY. MEETINGS WITH. WITH A IF AND KIND OF PARTNER. TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM. OUR PROGRAM WHAT WE DO AND HOW THEY CAN BEST PREPARE. UNDERSTOOD AND THEN BRIEFLY YOUR YOU MENTION MICRO GRIDS. WHEN I JUST GET A SENSE OF YOUR POSITION WE ALREADY PASSED SB THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH- GIVES THE P. YOU SEE A FORTY TO PROMOTE. AND FACILITATE MICRO GRIDS BOTH. BEHIND THE METER AND IN FRONT OF THE METER THE GRADE LEVEL SO WHEN YOU GET A SENSE OF- YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHETHER AN EMERGENCY TARIFF. OR SOME OTHER EXPEDITED PROCESS A P. YOU SEE MAKE SENSE. EITHER FOR BEHIND THE METER MAKER GRADE I NAY BILLING OR IN FRONT OF ME. WHY DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE NOTION OF GENERATORS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOMERS TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF. POWER SHUT OFFS. AND SO YOU'LL SEE IN OUR UPCOMING WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN THAT WE WANT TO INCREASE. THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS WITH THIS. SOUL OR BATTERY GENERATOR. BECAUSE THE FEEDBACK FROM CUSTOMERS HAS BEEN. VERY VERY POSITIVE. THEM BEING ABLE TO PLUG IN THEIR LIFE SAVING DEVICES INTO THIS YOU KNOW FIFTY HOUR SO BATTERY SO. YOU'LL SEE US REALLY RAMP THAT PROCESS UP. AND IN TERMS OF ACTION ALLOWING BEHIND THE METER CUSTOMERS TO ADOPT THEIR OWN. GENERATION SO NOT NOT OWNED BY YOU BUT OWN BY THIRD PARTIES BEHIND THE METER. OPENNESS TO THAT- WELL I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU POSITION IS THE PC RIGHT NOW. YEAH I THINK CENTER- SO LIKE I MEAN I THINK IN ALL THESE AREAS WERE WHAT WERE WE WERE WILLING AND OPEN HAVE A CONVERSATION- WITH YOU WITH YOUR OFFICE- WITH OUR REGULATORS IN SN FRANCISCO NOT SEE WITH COMMUNITY SEMI TODAY WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF TERRORISTS AND- AND OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS AT THE WANT INSTALL SOLAR. THEY WANT INSTALL INSTALL BATTERY BACKUP SO THERE ARE READY TERRACE IN PLACE TODAY FOR CUSTOMER OWN GENERATION. BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT COULD BE NEXT IF THERE'S ANY NEW IDEAS OUT THERE. SHE THEN I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR GETTING PROACTIVE. I LAST SESSION I KNOW WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL IN PUSHING IT THROUGH BUT HARDENING THOSE CRITICAL CIRCUITS. AND REALLY PUSHING FOR A MICRO GRIDS AGAIN AT THE GRADE LEVEL SO THIS CRITICAL CIRCUITS DON'T GO DOWN AND THEN ALSO THE BROADER COMPROMISE LOOKING BEHIND THE METERS WELL IN A COMBINATION THOSE TOO SO. SHE THEN UNDER REPEAL. THANK YOU. WAS HE HEARD MY QUESTION EARLIER I WAS REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVING PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTAND DID THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE THE AREAS THAT THEIR SERVICE IN BUT I DID HEAR YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE AHEAD IN TERMS OF FIVE HAVING SOME OF THE OFFICERS GO OUT AND SPEND TIME WITH THE COMMUNITIES- UNDERSTAND TRIBAL GROUPS AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE SENSITIVE POPULATIONS WERE BEING ADDRESSED AND TAKING CARE OF WHICH I REALLY COMMEND YOU FOR BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A BIG BIG ISSUE HI JUST WANTED TO SPEAK IF YOU. CAN IN TERMS OF THE TRIAL AND ERROR SO YOU'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCE IN ENGAGING WITH THESE COMMUNITIES WERE SPECIFICALLY IF YOU CAN GIVE EXAMPLES WITH BY THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY. HOW ARE YOU WORKING WITH THEM. BUT I WOULD SAY A LET ME START AND THEN SCOTT YOU CAN YOU CAN ADD IN HERE. IN TERMS OF THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A TRIBAL A NEW POSITION PROBABLY WITH THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WHICH IS THE TRIBAL LIAISON. AND THIS PERSON HAS BEEN OUR POINT CONTACT WITH ALL OF THE- AND- THE TRIBAL. TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THE SERVICE TERRITORY. AND THAT HAS BEEN A GREAT HELP FOR US IN TERMS OF REALLY OPENING UP THE COMMUNICATIONS. AND WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS EVEN BEFORE WE HAVE A POWER SHUT OFF ABOUT. THEIR RATIONS HOW LONG WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE SO THAT THEY CAN PREPARE MORE. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT- AT SD JEANNIE WE HAVE A NEW- WILDFIRE COMMUNITY SAFETY COUNCIL. BECAUSE LITERALLY EIGHT- WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO NEW IDEAS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE KEEPING OUR PROGRAM FRESH. SO WE HAVE A WILD FIRES. COMMITTEE SAFETY PER COUNCIL WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER TEN INDIVIDUALS WITHIN OUR OUR- SERVICE TERRITORY. INCLUDING THE CHAIRMAN FROM THE TRIBAL. AREAS TO BE ABLE TO COME ON TOUR A COMMITTEE INCOME UNDER COUNSEL HERE WHAT WE DO AND GIVE US RECOMMENDATIONS SO. WE'RE ALL ABOUT LISTENING. TO OUR COMMUNITIES LISTENING TO CUSTOMERS. AND SEEING HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE. THAT WE UNDERSTAND THEIR EXPERIENCES AND HOW WE CAN HELP THEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT. VERY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE ROSTER NEXT TEAM FROM EDISON TO COME FORWARD NOW BEING HERE THANKS VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING OUR AXES GOOD AFTERNOON NOW WELL MADAM PRO TEM ATKINS AND TEAR HUESO. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SENATORS IN ATTENDANCE ON CELL HARRINGTON TO SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. I AM PROUD TO REPRESENT THE TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WOMEN AND MEN ABOUT C. E. WHO STEADFASTLY SERVE OUR FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND ALLOWING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SHARE THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING AND WHILE FIRE MITIGATION DISCUSS RECENT PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICER PS PS ACTIVITY. NOT FIRST I'D LIKE TO KNOWLEDGE OF FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS WHO WORK AROUND THE CLOCK IN THE MOST DANGEROUS CONDITIONS TO SAVE OUR COMMUNITIES SO FOR THEM OFFER A HEARTFELT THANK YOU- TO OUR NEIGHBORS WHO HELP EACH OTHER EVACUATE. SAFELY TO OPEN YOUR DOORS TO STRANGERS THANK YOU. MADISON E. REMAIN COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT- MUCH LIKE SAID YOU'RE GONNA GET GAS ELECTRIC JUST HEARING AND IN THAT SPIRIT WHILE I'M HERE TO BRIEF YOU. I'M ALSO HERE TO LISTEN. NOW WE WELCOME IN VALUE FEEDBACK. TO ALL OF US FIRST RESPONDERS CITIES COUNTIES UTILITIES. AND THE PUBLIC ARE DROPPING TO START A WILDFIRE THE SAME TIME. NOW DIALOGUES LIKE THIS ARE IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE TO CONFRONT THIS MULTI FACETED CHALLENGE FOR US. AS CNN STANDS THE PS PS CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND HARDSHIP FOR MANY. OUR USED PS PS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. NOW WE DO SO ONLY VERY SERIOUS WEATHER CONDITIONS AND WHEN WE DO THIS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE REST ARE ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT STARTS A FIRE. NO WELL BEFORE THE INCREASING THE RISK OF WILDFIRES WAS APPARENT WE ARE INVESTNG IN A SMARTER STRONGER GRID. OVER THIS LAST DECADE WE'VE INVESTED TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ARE ELECTRIC SYSTEM. NOW OVER THE PAST DECADE WE'VE ALSO INVESTED ELEVEN BILLION FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING AS A SUBSET THAT TWENTY SEVEN BILLION. UPGRADING% MODERNIZING THE GRADE WAS STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY WELL HAVING THE ADDED VALUE REDUCING THE SCOPE AND SCALE TIAS OFFENSE. THESE EVENTS ARE THESE INVESTMENTS ALLOWS TO SECTION LIES ARE SYSTEM SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT COULD BE IMPACTED. NOW THE FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS IN OUR SERVICE AREA WASN'T A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR TWO PERCENT. OR IMPACT IN OUR MOST SEVERE EVENT THIS YEAR. OUR NUMBERS VERY SIMILAR THE SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC NUMBER YOU JUST HEARD.% THAT SAID IF YOU'RE A CUSTOMER WHO'S BEEN IMPACTED BY P. S. P. S. R. BILLION SECTIONAL IS A GREAT DOESN'T MINIMIZE ARCHIE FACE. AND RECOGNITION OF THAT DIFFICULTY OR ACTIVELY WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES TO DETERMINE HOW WE CAN MINIMIZE THE IMPACT YES BE YES. AND THROUGH GREAT HARDENING AND OPERATIONAL CHANGES REDUCE THE NECESSITY OF THEM OVER TIME. THE TODAY I WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS FOR MITIGATION EFFORTS DISCUSS RECENT PS PS EVENTS. AND LESSONS LEARNED AND AREAS WERE ADAPTING APPROACH BASED ON CUSTOMER FEEDBACK IT'S CRITICAL TO US. KEEPING PS PS IN CONTEXT IS JUST ONE OF THE WAYS THAT SEIZE ADAPTING TO A CHANGING CLIMATE REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR EQUIPMENT WILL CAUSE THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE ALLOW FOR MITIGATION PROGRESS BECAUSE THE CLEAR LINKAGE BETWEEN MITIGATION AND PSP S. ACTIVITY. NOW WE REMAIN LASER FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING OUR WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLAN AGREED SAFETY RESILIENCY PROGRAM TO BOLSTER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. FURTHER HARDENER INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENHANCE OUR OPERATIONAL PRACTICES IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. NETWORKS ALREADY THESE EFFORTS AS WE WAIT TO SEE IF YOU SEE DECISION OR APPROVAL FOR THESE PROGRAMS. THAT WE DEPLOYED FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE OF OUR PLAN EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY WEATHER STATIONS TO MONITOR TEMPERATURE WIND SPEEDS AND HUMIDITY LEVELS. THE REAL TIME DATA THEY PROVIDE IS CRITICAL AN INVALUABLE TO US ESPECIALLY P. SPS OFFENSE. NOW WE'RE ON TRACK TO COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION ARE PLANNED ONE HUNDRED SIXTY HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS TO MORE QUICKLY DETECT FIRE MISSIONS. BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WILL HAVE COVERAGE ACROSS 90% OF OUR HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. NOW WE ILLOWS INSTALLED FOUR HUNDRED MILES OF INSULATED OR COVER CONDUCTOR WIRE BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. UNLIKE BARE WIRE WHICH IS INDUSTRY STANDARD SHOULD A TREE BRANCH POMPON MYLAR BALLOON BROTHER VEGETATION COMING CONTACT WITH AN INSULATED LINE. IT WILL NOT CREATE A SPARK THAT COULD CAUSE A FIRE. IF ARE PENDING GENERAL RATE CASES APPROVED WE WILL INSTALL SIX THOUSAND MILES OF COVER CONDUCTOR BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SIX THOUSAND MILES. THREE YEARS AHEAD OF OUR ORIGINAL PLAN AND FOCUSED ON THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS FIRST OR FOCUS ON THOSE INITIALLY TO REDUCE RISK AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. NO WE'VE INSTALLED FAST ACTING FUSES IT MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND LOCATIONS OVER THIS LAST YEAR AND A HALF WITH PLANS TO UPGRADE THOUSANDS MORE. OF THESE FUSES VERY QUICKLY ISOLATE PROBLEMS AND ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL SOURCE OF IGNITIONS. AND ALSO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AFFECTED BY AN OUTAGE FORMA SECTIONALS ATION. ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE CHANCE OF FIRES FROM UTILITY EQUIPMENT. AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR PS PS. NEXT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO PSP INCIDENT SPECIFICALLY HOW WE MAKE DINNER JASON DECISIONS AND LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM CUSTOMER FEEDBACK. OCTOBER WAS A MONTH OF HARD HEIGHTENED FIRE RISK ACROSS THE STATE. DURING THE LAST WEEK OF THE MONTH FEROCIOUS SANTA ANA WINDS PROMPTED THE MEASURE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. TO ISSUE AN UNPRECEDENTED EXTREME RED FLAG WARNING FOR MUCH OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN THIS PARTICULAR FIRE WEATHER EVENT ARE MOST SEVERE TO DATE. WE NOTIFIED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS OF POSSIBLE P. S. P. S. AND DINNER JUDGE JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. FOR THIS EVENT AND OTHERS THAT OCCURRED THIS YEAR WE USE GRANULAR WE'LL TIME WEATHER INFORMATION TO DE ENERGIZED SECTIONS RATHER THAN THE ENTIRE LENGTH. OF CIRCUITS THE PAST INVESTMENTS THOSE I SPOKE OF EARLIER. HAVE A QUICKER CIRCUITS IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS TO HAVE AN AVERAGE OF FOUR ISOLATION POINTS PROVIDING THE ABILITY TO ISOLATE PORTIONS OF THE CIRCUIT. AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE THE NUMBER OF IMPACTED CUSTOMERS. THESE ARE TWO IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR PS PS PROGRAM. THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE ENERGIES INCISIONS BASED ON ACTUAL CONDITIONS ON A CIRCUIT BY CIRCUIT BASIS. AND THE USE OF TECHNOLOGIES TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF IMPACTED CUSTOMERS. WE RECOGNIZE GENERALIZATION MAY BE SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP IS A SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP FOR OUR CUSTOMERS BUT IT SERVES A VITAL PURPOSE. THE CITY IN FACT PATROLS CONDUCTED AFTER PSP AS EVENTS FOUND MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF EQUIPMENT DAMAGE THE TREE BRANCHES ON POWER LINES THE COULD HAVE IGNITED A FIRE HAD WE NOT DE ENERGIZED. THAT WE CALL PSP HAS TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES LET ME BRIEFLY SHARE HOW WE DECIDED DE ENERGIZE A LINE. WE BASE OUR DECISION ON MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WARNINGS. ASSESSMENTS FROM OUR IN HOUSE NEUROLOGISTS IN FIRE SCIENTISTS. REAL TIME INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM FEELS OBSERVERS AND STRATEGICALLY DEPLOYED WEATHER STATIONS. CONCERNS FROM FIRST RESPONDERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES AND EXPECTED IMPACTED THE ENERGIZING CIRCUITS ON ESSENTIAL SERVICES SUCH AS HOSPITALS WATER PUMPS AND TRAFFIC CONTROLS. THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED WRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR LOCAL AND STATE FIRE SORTIES. COUNTY AND STATE OFFICES OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDER AGENCIES. WE BEGIN OUR RESTREPO LOOKS A TWO POWERS THREE DAYS. IN ADVANCE OF THE S. P. S. EVENTS THAT WE SET UP OUR I AM T. AS EARLY SEVEN DAYS WE'RE MOBILIZING TO RESPOND TO THESE INFO IN SEVEN DAYS IN ADVANCE OF EVENT. TO SOLICIT POLITICAL CONCERT POTENTIAL CONCERNS REGARDING PUBLIC SAFETY WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THIS IMPORTANT PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE EVENT. THE COMBINATION OF LOCAL COORDINATION AND FORECAST DATA HOUSE IS TO SCHEDULE PEOPLE TROLLS. LIFE FIELD OBSERVATIONS INTO STRATEGICALLY REACH OUT TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR POTENTIAL DE ENERGIES ATION. THE NEXT SELECT DRILLED ON OUR CUSTOMER NOTIFICATION PROCESS. IT IS OUR GOAL TO PROVIDE NOTICE OUR CUSTOMERS UP TO FORTY EIGHT AND TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE A POTENTIAL PSP AS A VENT. HOWEVER WEATHER CONDITIONS CAN SHIFT UNEXPECTEDLY SOMETIMES DRAMATICALLY WHICH IN SOME INSTANCES CAN LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADVANCE NOTICE. WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO SIGN UP FOR PS PS NOTIFICATIONS. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN DO THAT BY YOUR ROLLING AT S. C. .COM FORWARD SLASH PS PS. NO WE SEND ALERTS AND NOTIFICATIONS TO CUSTOMERS TO THE PREFERRED METHOD OF CONTACT. TEXT EMAIL PHONE. AND NEXT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC GROUPS OF INTO INTEREST TO ALL OF US MEDICAL BASELINE CRITICAL CARE AND ACCESS AND FUNCTION LEADS. WE ACTIVELY IDENTIFY MEDICAL BASELINE IN CRITICAL CARE RELY SUPPORT CUSTOMERS TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE CONTACT INFORMATION. AND THEIR ROLE TO RECEIVE OUTAGE NOTIFICATIONS. WE ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO HELP THEM PREPARE RESILIENCY AND SAFETY PLANS WHEN THESE TYPES OF EVENTS OCCUR. IT WOULD TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMERS WHEN WE CANNOT CONFIRM THAT ALERTS NOTIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED. WE SENT A COMPANY REPRESENTED FOR THEIR HOME TO NOTIFY THEM IN PERSON. AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE AN EMERGENCY PLAN AND IN SPECIAL SIR INSTANCES OR CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMER DOES NOT HAVE AN EMERGENCY PLAN AND MAY NEED BACKUP POWER WILL DISCUSS PROVIDING TEMPORARY SOLUTION. ACTUALLY IN OUR EXPERIENCE THIS IS BEEN RELATIVELY RARE. NEVER ACCESS AND FUNCTION NEEDS CUSTOMERS WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH STATEWIDE AND LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS. WE HAVE LEVERAGE EXISTING PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS AND CUSTOMER PROGRAMS TO FOCUS ON PSP AS PREPAREDNESS. ALL HAS AWARENESS AND EMERGENCY PLANNING AS WELL. AND WE CONTINUE TO BUILD NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS COUNTY WIDE DISABILITY COLLABORATIVE'S. AND NONPROFIT SERVING PORTABLE COMMUNITIES. WE'VE ESTABLISHED TWO NEW PROGRAMS TO ASSIST ARE IMPACTED CUSTOMERS DURING PSP OFFENSE. COMMUNITY CREW VEHICLES A COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS. THESE ARE OUT WE CENTERS WE DEPLOYED IMPACTED COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE CHARGING STATIONS SNACKS AND WATER MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR TEAM MEMBERS TALK TO CUSTOMERS TO CAPTURE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS PROVIDE INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO THE EVENT ITS ONGOING. THAT WERE EXPANDING BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS SIGNIFICANTLY BY YEAR END. NOW IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS IN TAKE AWAYS. FIRST WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE VALUE THEIR FEEDBACK THIS IS A CRITICAL PART OF OUR PROGRAM. WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO FURTHER AUGMENT OUR PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE JUST LAST WEEK WE ENHANCE OUR WEBSITE WITH AN INTERACTIVE MAP SHOWING HIEROS FIRES THAT ARE BEING MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL PS PS. OR ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A PEACE PROCESS. IN ADDITION FOR NON ACCOUNT HOLDERS SUCH AS RENTERS TENANTS FAMILY RELATIVES. THANK YOU REGISTER TO RECEIVE OUT ALERTS BASED ON ZIP CODES. AND WE'RE ENHANCING THE PRESENTATION OF QUALITY OF PS PS WEB CONTENT WHICH INCLUDES A MOBILE FIRST USER EXPERIENCE DESIGNED TO FIT SMALLER SCREENS. AND NEXT WE'VE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED OUR CAPACITY TO HANDLE THE VOLUME AND FREQUENCY OF WEB TRAFFIC FOR EVENTS LIKE PS PS ANOTHER MAJOR CATASTROPHES. WE'VE HEARD AND AGREE STRONGLY THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO SECTION LIGHTING CIRCUITS. AND BEING AS PRECISE AS POSSIBLE WHEN PS PS IS NEEDED. NOW WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THESE OPPORTUNITIES I WOULD WELCOME APPROVAL ARE PENDING GS RP. AND YOUR C. REQUEST SO WE CAN MAINTAIN MOMENTUM OF THIS VITAL VITAL WORK. NO I DIDN'T TOUCH ON IT TODAY. WE VALUE OUR ROLE IN ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY GOALS. FOR THE LIKE EXPECTED BIRTHDATE TO PLAY THE ROLE IT MUST NEW SHARE JURY TO CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. WE KNOW WE NEED TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY. NOW WITH THOSE CLOSING THOUGHTS I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE IS THIS ISSUE IS TO YOU AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL. AND HE SAFETY OF OUR CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES AND COMMUNITIES IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. NOT BEHALF OF WOMEN AND MEN OF THE CITY. MANY ABLY REPRESENTED BY IBEW LOCAL FORTY SEVEN. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU. OUR REGULATORS OUR CUSTOMERS ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. TO CONTINUE TURNING COURSE ARISES TO THE EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES BEFORE US. SO THANK YOU AND WELCOME QUESTIONS THANK YOU SENATOR BUILDER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YEAH I WAS GOING TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS HERE BUT I- YOU CAUGHT MY EAR YOU'D SEE MADE A COMMENT. SOMETHING IS. TO THE- LIKE OF IF APPROVED. YOU I THINK YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT CODED WIRES SIX THOUSAND. OVER BY 200-023-6000 MILES. IF APPROVED YOU COULD DO THIS AND SO I GUESS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I'M WONDERING FROM THE REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE. ARE THERE ANY HOLD UPS TO YOU MOVING FORWARD FASTER TO REDUCE FIRE RISK IN THAT ALSO. TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS. THANK YOU CENTER NOT APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- FIRST OF ALL- AND JUST BACK TO THE WHOLE BASIS OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICE- THEY'RE ONE OF MANY AREAS IN WAYS THAT WERE REDUCING AND NEGATING THREAT OF WILDFIRES. AND WE'RE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE IMPACT THAT THEY HAVE ON OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES- WE DO NOT TAKE IT LIGHTLY- WE BASE OUR CAREER ON THE LIABILITY SO- BUT SAFETY IS FIRST- WITH THAT- EVEN BEFORE WE FILED OUR GOOD SAY TO RESULT YOU PROGRAM WE WERE INVESTING IN COVER CONDUCTOR IN FACT WE- WE GOT A- HEAD START- THAT WAS PRECEDED BY MANY YEARS I MENTIONED THE- ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH FOCUSED. ON THINGS THAT COULD HELP US AND WHILE FIRE MITIGATION THAT WAS NOT RELATED TO OUR G. S. R. P. SPECIFICALLY BUT WE'VE BEEN INVESTING EVEN WITHOUT THOSE. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE APPROVED THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ASSURANCE THAT AS WE GO FORWARD WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT AS I SAID WE'VE ALREADY DEPLOYED FOUR HUNDRED MILES OF COVER CONDUCTOR- BECAUSE WE DO IT'S AN IMPORTANT MEDICATION ELEMENT. WE'VE ALSO- IN GAYS AND ALL THE ELEMENTS OF RGS RP THE WEATHER STATIONS I MENTIONED- THE- THE HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THERE'S MANY LAYERS THAT ARE IN THOSE PROGRAMS- WE THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT SO WE STARTED. WE STARTED IN PARALLEL FOR OUR- COMMISSION APPROVAL THOSE PROGRAMS. GERMAN BOB. I RECOGNIZE YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO BE PUT A POSITION OF CRITICIZING YOUR REGULATOR AT AT A HEARING LIKE THIS HOWEVER. I WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN. ARE THERE ANY REGULATORY IMPEDIMENTS. TO YOU- THE- CAUSING HOLD UP TO YOU. TO MOVE FORWARD FASTER ON- MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE FIRE WE'RE ASKS ONE INTO- TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF P. S. P. S. EVENTS. KELLY CENTER I CANNOT THINK OF AN AREA WHERE THAT REGULATORY HOLD UP IS PREVENTING US FROM DOING SOMETHING THAT I THINK IN THE LONG TERM WE'RE GOING TO NEED THE ASSURANCE THAT WE HAVE REGULATORY SUPPORT FOR THE WORK WE'RE DOING BUT WE FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT IT THAT WE- BASICALLY LEAD. WE LEAD WITH- WITH OUR ACTIONS AND IT'S WHY WE STARTED THESE PROGRAMS EVEN EARLIER THAN WE HAD A COMMISSION APPROVAL FOR THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE WILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WELL YOU SAID YOU ONLY HAD 2% OF YOUR SERVICE AREA DOWN TO FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WELL I GUESS I MUST BE PART OF THE 2% SO I GUESS I'M PART OF PART OF THE ELITE CAN YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU READ YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS SO I WANT TO THESE ARE THESE ARE DIRECTLY FROM CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE. AND YOU MAY NOT EVEN HAVE AN ANSWER BELLY SHE KNOW ABOUT IT IN SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN BEGIN MEDICAID IN THE FUTURE SO I HAVE A EIGHTY TWO YEAR OLD DISABLED VETERAN- IN A WHEELCHAIR AND ALSO ON OXYGEN HE CALLED DURING HIS THIRTY SIX HOUR SHUT DOWN A CALLED ADDRESS AND HE WAS TOLD TO CALL NINE ONE ONE. SO IT IS IT SO ACTUALLY HE DIDN'T CALL MY OFFICE HE CALLED A LOCAL SO WOMEN'S OFFICE IN IN HIM AND I. BORROWED A TRUCK. DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SET UP A GENERATOR AND DID THAT SO IS THAT WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING YOUR CUSTOMERS DO IF THEY HAVE A SUCH AS SITUATIONS THEY JUST CALL NINE ONE ONE- I'D MAYBE TAKE OUT A COUPLE OF LEVELS WE GET AND JUST TO REITERATE- WE- WE RECOGNIZE THE HARDSHIPS AND THIS IS A- CASE IN POINT OF THE HARDSHIPS THAT A P. S. P. S. PROGRAM CAN PUT IN PLACE- BEFORE THE EVENT START WE ARE ENGAGING WITH OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. AND PARTICULARLY- FIREFIGHTING OFFICIALS. TO HELP US UNDERSTAND- WHAT THE CRITICAL NEEDS MIGHT BE IN A COMMITTEE NOT ZERO NINE ZERO AND A CUSTOMER CUSTOMER BASIS. BUT IN HOW THAT DINNER DETECTION COULD IMPACT THAT COMMUNITY- AS TO THE SPECIFIC SITUATION. WE WOULD. REALLY WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THIS PARTICULAR CUSTOMER SO. IF YOU COULD NOT PROVIDE IS INFORMATION- AT THE END OF THIS HEARING I WOULD GLADLY TAKE IT UP AND WE'LL GET BACK TO HIM. I DO THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE CASES CANDIDLY WHERE- EMERGENCY RESPONSE IS NECESSARY. WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO SUPPORT CUSTOMERS BUT I THINK EMERGENCY LIFESAVING SITUATIONS. NINE ONE ONE IS A TOOL THAT- CUSTOMERS WILL NEED TO USE. UP WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TAKE FEEDBACK AND ADJUST OUR PROGRAMS. AND THIS KIND OF INFORMATION IS VERY HELPFUL TO US AND UNDERSTANDING. BOTH IMPACTS AND WHAT ROLE WE CAN PLAY. IN MINIMIZING THOSE IMPACTS. THANK CENTER SO. NEXT SCENARIO IS THAT I THINK TWO WEEKS AGO NOW A RURAL COMMUNITY- ACTING CALIFORNIA. AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY IT WAS A THE RULE COUNCIL BUT AT EDISON WAS THERE AND I WANTED TO COMMEND THEM FOR THEIR- COURAGE- WE'RE NOT REALLY GOOD ON ANSWERS BUT CERTAINLY WORD. THEY TOOK IT. AND TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE WERE THERE AND THEY HAVE HOME BASED BUSINESSES AGAIN THEY WERE OUT OVER THIRTY HOURS. OF THE FILE THE NECESSARY PAPERWORK TO FILE A CLAIM THE CLAIM WAS DENIED. AND THEY CALLED AND THEY SAID- YOU KNOW JUST TAKE US TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT. SO I'M JUST WONDERING SHOULD. MIKE ASSERTIONS GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS OR SHOULD WE JUST GO DIRECTLY TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND IF THEY DO. WHO WOULD THEY FILED OUT NO- AND THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT ON AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER CASE OF WHERE WE'RE TAKING OUR CUSTOMERS FEEDBACK. A COMMUNITY BACK TO HEART- WE HAVE- ODDLY ENOUGH BEEN ABLE AND HAVE BEEN DOING A PSP AS WE LIKE WE DID OUR FIRST ONE AND- TWO THOUSAND AND THREE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR TIME FRAME. A VERY LONG TIME AGO- DID YOU USE IT. FRANKLY BETWEEN THEN AND UNTIL RECENTLY I WOULD SAY STARTED USING IT MORE AGAIN- IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIHTEEN TIME RAME. THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR WE REALLY HAVE USED IT I WOULD SAY- SUBSTANTIALLY IN OUR MITIGATION PROGRAM. THIS IS A LONG WINDED WAY OF SAYING. THIS IS NEW TO OUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT USED TO SEEING THIS. AND WHILE WE'VE DONE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC OUTREACH IN TERMS OF BROADCASTING COMMUNITY TOWN HALLS AND OTHER EVENTS- WE RECOGNIZE CUSTOMERS AREN'T REALLY READY FOR THIS. IN RECOGNITION OF THAT WERE ADJUSTING OUR CLAIMS POLICY FOR SPOILAGE. I THAT WOULD BE FOOD AND MEDICAL- AND YOU GIVE. PRESCRIPTIONS THINGS IT MAY GO BAD- AT HIGH TEMPERATURES- WHAT WE WILL DO AT LEAST THROUGH THE END OF NEXT JANUARY- FOR CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT OF POWER- FOR EIGHT HOURS A MORE. AND HAVE LESS THAN A TWELVE HOUR NOTICE OF A- DE ENERGY STATION WE WILL BE HONORING THOSE CLAIMS SO I RECOMMEND THEY GO BACK TO OUR CLAIMS GROUP- AND WE WILL I WILL ADDRESS THOSE. IT'S A SPECIFIC CUSTOMER YOU CAN JUST PUT HIM IN TOUCH WITH ONE OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES HERE. I WILL MAKE SURE THAT GETS TAKEN CARE OF. SO OKAY SO FOLLOW UP WORK I WASN'T ASKING THIS ONE BUT NOT SO YOU SAID ON THE FOOD SPICES THAT SO THAT. DOES THAT APPLY TO RESTAURANTS AS WELL THEN. IT DOES. OKAY GREAT. SO THIS A PERSON I'VE NOT MET YET I'M ASSUMING ON THE METER BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER MEDICINE. TOWN HALL- TOMORROW NIGHT NO NOT TOMORROW A WEDNESDAY NIGHT I WILL BE THERE SO IT'S A CONSTITUENT AN AWKWARD BILLS SAY. AND I GOT THIS EMAIL IN LAST NIGHT SO I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY MET HER. BUT SHE SAID SHE JUST GOT HER BILL. AND. THAT SHE WAS CHARGED FOR THE TIME WHEN. THEY WERE OUT OF POWER. COULD I GUESS WHAT YOU GUYS DO IF THEY CAN READ THE METER THEY JUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. ON HOW MUCH ENERGY THEY CONSUME SO SHE WAS BUILT. FOR ENERGY SHE HAD NO WAY OF DRAWING BECAUSE YOU GUYS CUT OUR POWER OFF. BOBBI CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND THAT WE IN- SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS DO GET BILLS BASIN ESTIMATED USAGE BUT WE CATCH UP WITH THAT THE NEXT CYCLE SO OUR EXPECTATION WOULD BE WE'RE GONNA BACK THAT OUT. AND THE CHARGE WILL BE FIXED BUT I CAN TELL THE FIVE HUNDRED ANGRY PEOPLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF AND THEIR NEXT BILL AND WE WILL NOT CHARGE FOR POWER DOES NOT DELIVERED THAT'S A VERY GOOD. IT MIGHT MIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY FINAL QUESTION I WENT AT WHAT POINT WE GONNA LEARN THE. ORIGINATION AT THE CHECK CANYON FIRE. ALL THESE FIRES ARE UNDER SOME FORM OF INVESTIGATION SO I REALLY CANNOT PREDICT THAT- MY EXPERIENCE WITH OUR INVESTIGATIONS IS THAT CAN BE LENGTHY- MANY MONTHS SO THAT CERTAINLY PROCESSES I'M GOING BUT- I REALLY DON'T HAVE A AN ANSWER FOR YOU FOR AS A TIME FRAME IS CONCERNED RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE ARE MORE LETTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER HERRINGTON YOU I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED MY FIRST TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT- YOU CALLED SECTIONAL EYES BUT I WAS USING THE TERM POWER TO BURGER AND YOU USED FAST ACTING FUSES SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY HOPEFULLY THE SAME THING THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT OVERHEAD LINES AND YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN. COVERING THE LINE SO I WANTED JUST A ADDRESS WILL TWENTY A WHICH WILL HAVE A REPORT FROM THE CPUC WHICH CAME OUT TWENTY SIXTEEN AND YOU STILL HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION RESERVISTS DO BEAUTIFICATION UNDER GROUNDING OF. OF BLINDS IN YOUR JURISDICTIONAL AREA. MANY. FEEDBACK ON ON HOW THAT'S PROGRESSING AND HOW WE'RE HELPING COMMUNITIES WITH WILDFIRE. JONES IS AS FAR AS RULE TWENTY A WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT ONE I THINK THAT'S A- SOME OF THOSE FUNDS ARE OBVIOUSLY ALLOCATED TO NON HIGH BAR RISK AREAS- SOME OF THAT IS. REALLY DEDICATED AS YOU NOTE FOR BEAUTIFICATION AN ASCETIC PURPOSES I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE WORKING THROUGH- UNDER GROUNDING HE IS A SOLUTION ONE OF MANY ANSWERS FRANKLY SOME TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERGROUND AND- RESTORATION TIME IS ONE OF THEM- TIME TO INSTALL THAT TECHNOLOGY IS ANOTHER- TALKING ON THE FIRST POINT OUT WHEN YOU HAVE A FAULT IN AN UNDERGROUND LINE IT CAN TAKE SOME TIME TO TROUBLESHOOT THAT. WE NEED A MUCH LONGER OUTAGES- THERE THERE ARE RESILIENCY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH A CERTAIN EVENTS THAT CAN AFFECT UNDER GROUNDING THAT MAY NOT BE IMPACTING OUR OVERGROUND EQUIPMENT OR ABOVE GROUND EQUIPMENT SAME WAY- PERMITTING CAN TAKE SOME TIME AND AGAIN- IT TAKES MUCH LONGER TO CONSTRUCT. AND AGAIN THIS ISN'T SOLELY ACOSTA ISSUE THE COST IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE- IT'S AROUND EIGHT TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN EVEN OUR COVER CONDUCTOR OVERHEAD SOLUTION IS- BUT THAT IS PART OF OUR ARSENAL THE LAST WEEK WE DO FEEL THAT THERE ARE PLACES WHERE UNDERGROUND IS THE BEST SOLUTION. THE WAY WE'RE APPROACHING THIS IS A VERY I CAN USE OR GRANULAR AGAIN A GRANULAR ASSESSMENT OF RISK OUR SYSTEM THAT LOOKS AT THE CONSEQUENCES A POTENTIAL IGNITIONS AND WE FOCUS ON THOSE THAT THERE WILL BE AREAS THAT MAY BE- ARE SO CONSEQUENCE ON THE END OF A WILDFIRE THAT UNDERGROUND IS THE BEST SOLUTION. AND WILL USE THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT IS THE CASE SO YOU'RE NOT THE CEO OF EDISON SO WHAT I'M GONNA ASK YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT- YOU- ARE ONE OF THREE. I USE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE STATE. SO YOU SOMEWHERE IN HISTORY YOU GRANT. FRENCH I ZERO ZONE OF THE STATE- AND I'M JUST CURIOUS THEN- IF YOU'RE CHARTER BY THE STATE IN A SCENE BY THE STATE. CAN YOUR CHARTER BE REVOKED IN CAN THE STATE. IN A SENSE NATIONALIZE YOUR UTILITY IF I COULD USE THAT TERM TO SAY OKAY WHAT WE'RE TAKING OVER WE DON'T LIKE HOW YOU'RE PERFORMING WE'RE GONNA DO IT OURSELVES YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR THAT ONE'S DEFINITELY OUT OF MY DEPTH SO- BUT- WHAT I COULD SHARE WITH YOU THOUGH- AND IF THIS DOESN'T COME THROUGH THE TALKING POINTS. MAYBE WILL FURTHER INTO AN A- I THINK AS YOU LOOK AT THE I USE I CAN REALLY ONLY SPEAK FOR US CALLOUS AND THAT'S WHERE I WORK- WE ARE COMMITTED TO INNOVATION AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES- MANY THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF OUR APPROACH INCOME A CONDUCTOR BUT MAYBE THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES- HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK ON SOMETHING WHERE WE'VE DEVELOPED. OF THE ABILITIES ARE SMART METERS TO DETECT WHEN A WIRES DOWN SALAS SMART METERS WE DEPLOYED- OVER THE YEARS- WE CAN USE INFORMATION COMING FROM THOSE DEVICES TO PROTECT AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LINE IS ON THE GROUND- WE ARE DOING THAT KIND OF INNOVATION. AND I THINK THAT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY MODEL DOES HELP US IN THE INNOVATION SPACE SO I CANNOT REALLY SPEAK TO REGULATORY MAKE I'M TALKING. MORE ABOUT OUR PRIDE AND INNOVATION BUT. UP AS FAR AS A REGULATORY UNDERPINNINGS OF. UNCLE INTO STATE OWNERSHIP OF THE UTILITIES ARE REALLY NOT. SPEAK ABOUT THAT. BUT YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE AND YOUR YOUR REGULATED OR YOUR OWN YES SCENE SO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABUT THE CPUC AND- IS. IS ARE YOU ARE YOU HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP IS IT WORKING PROPERLY. MY A MY EXPECTED MY FEELING IS YES IT IS I THINK THERE IS A- REGULATORS SOMEONE WHO- AN ENTITY THAT DOT LOOKS OUT OVER THE- REGULATED UTILITIES I'VE OPERATED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS-JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA- I THINK- HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WHO ARE COMMISSIONER CRITICAL. I DO FEEL WE HAVE ONE- I THINK THERE'S ALWAYSGOING TO BE- SOME MIGHT DYNAMICS BETWEEN- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO AND WHAT- WHAT ARE COMMISSION ULTIMATELY- GIVES US OF THE OR TO DO- BUT OVERALL. I FEEL WE DO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. THANK YOU MISTER HERRINGTON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M GONNA ASK A VERY DIRECT QUESTION BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT- SENATOR THE GOOD CENTER FROM NAPA WAS TRYING TO GET TO. THIS ANSWER- SO I'VE HEARD THAT THERE IS A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT INVOLVING EDISON RELATED TO CREATE SAFETY AND RESILIENCY THAT HASN'T BEEN. RELEASED YET SO COULD SOMEONE FROM. I GUESS WE'LL HEAR ROM QC BUT LISA FROM YOU CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON ON THAT PARTICULAR. AGREEMENT BOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL AS AS YOU NOTED WE DO HAVE A SETTLEMENT WHICH OBVIOUSLY. OR MAYBE NOT OBVIOUSLY BUT DOES- BOLSTER ARGUE THAT THIS IS LIKELY TO BE APPROVED I CAN'T PREDICT THAT- NOT NOT MY- NOT MY PLACE. BUT I WILL SAY AGAIN I WAS NOT TRYING TO OF A DOZEN OR JOBS QUESTION- SPEEDY RESOLUTION APPROVALS ARE ALWAYS- I THINK OF A GOOD OUTCOME. THE NAME WAS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTED WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR APPROVAL FOR THAT AS WELL AS OUR GENERATE CASE WHICH HAS BEEN FILED AS OF LAST NOVEMBER. AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THE HOLDER COULD. BE I REALLY COULD NOT SPECULATE ON THAT. THANK YOU AND THEN I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING CELL PHONES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP YET. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THAT. I'M SORRY. YET CELL PHONES SO IS BEING USED FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES ARE CELL TOWERS AT LEAST IN YOUR JURISDICTION ARE THEY AT LEAST BEING PRIORITIZE IN ORDER TO. TO RESTORE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SO- MAYBE BACKING UP INTO OUR OVERALL PSP AS PROCESS- WE START. AGAIN DAYS IN ADVANCE FOR IMMOBILIZE- PEOPLE IN OUR I AM T. TO PROTECT THIS COMING. UP AND THEN RAMP UP EFFORTS RESOURCES AS IT BECOMES MORE MORE CERTAIN- WE HAVE THE SAME SORT OF TO- WEATHER FORECASTS TODAY WE HAVE A SUPER COMPUTER THAT ENABLES US TO MAKE- WEATHER PREDICTIONS- WE ALSO BRINGING EXTERNAL FORECASTS. WHEN WE GET TO THE ROUGHLY SEVENTY TWO ARE MARK WE'RE LETTING OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. AND OTHER WHAT WE CALL ESSENTIAL USE CUSTOMERS- KNOW WHAT'S COMING OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS ARE IN THAT. GROUP AND SO AROUND SEVENTY TWO HOURS WERE NOTIFYING THEM OF THE UPCOMING ARE IMMINENT- EVENT. SO WHEN A D. INTERFACING DOES OCCUR BECAUSE I THINK- CENTER TRYING YOU'RE ASKING ME TO BAR RESTORATION- WE'RE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF FACTORS. WHAT ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THIS REALLY GOVERNING OUR RESTORATION TIME FRAME. IS THE ABILITY TO GET OUT IN THE FIELD AND DO THE INSPECTIONS WE HAVE TO. SELL ONE OF THE IMPEDIMENTS AGAIN AS WIND- WE DO HELICOPTER PATROLS AS WELL AS DRUM PATROLS- BUT ALSO HAVING OUR- TEAMS OUT IN THE FIELD. WHEN THE WINDS HAVE- DECLINE TO A POINT WHERE WE BELIEVE IT IS SAFE TO RESTORE POWER TO THE LINES. THAT WE MAY HAVEDE ENERGIZED. SO I WOULD SAY WE DO LOOK AT LINES AND IF THEY HAVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE MANY FACTORS. WE CONSIDER. IN A RE ENERGIZE ATION SEQUENCE. THANK YOU CENTERS TURN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MY CONSTITUENTS. WERE IMPACTED OVER LAST FEW MONTHS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT HIGH WINDS AGAIN THIS WEEKEND. SO FROM THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF PS PS EVENTS I'M WONDERING. WHAT YOU LEARNED AND WHAT I TELL. I MENTION ALLEN FROM SEAMY VALLEY EARLIER AND T. FROM THOUSAND OAKS BUT- HOW FROM SEAMY VALLEY WITH A FOUR YEAR OLD A TWO AND A HALF YEAR OLD AN EIGHT MONTH OLD THE STAY AT. ILLNESS IS AT HOME MARIA IN CHATSWORTH. JOHN IT THEN AND DAVID AND RENEE IN SEEING ME. WHAT WHAT IT IS TO DO FOR TO GET READY FOR THIS WEEKEND WHO ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO CALL OF THEIR MEDICALLY VULNERABLE AND I SHOULD ADD TO THAT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER- SO. YOU KNOW DURING LAST BLACKOUT. SHE GOT VERY POWER SHUT OFF WITHOUT WARNING SHE IS MEDICATION SHE NEEDS TO. REFRIGERATED LIKELY MY PARENTS FOUND OUT SHE DOESN'T USE A CELL PHONE SO THEY WENT TO OUR HOUSE AND TOOK HER BACK TO THEIR HOUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO A COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MOST SKEPTICAL OF THAT STRATEGY BEING. WHEN THE ANCHORS OF YOUR MITIGATION STRATEGY TO HAVE SENIOR IS EXPECTED TO GO TO SOME HIGH SCHOOL AND SIT THERE FOR A DAY- AND LIKE WHEN THEY CAN BARELY WALK- DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE THE BEST WAY TO MITIGATE THAT IMPACTS SO WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO LIKE IT'S MONDAY. POWER MAY GO OFF ON SATURDAY SO WHO THEY CALL IF THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR POWER GOING. SO. THANK YOU CENTER FIRST OFF AGAIN I. WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS CLEARLY A CASE OF THE HARDSHIPS THAT WHAT THE SPS DOES INFLICT ON OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES- MILLION PLEASE. UNDERSTAND THIS IS SOMETHING WE DO FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY ASPECT OF IT. RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANT AND OFTEN PAINFUL TRADE OFF THEIR- THAT DOESN'T HELP YOUR GRANDMOTHER SO- MAYBE TALK MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THAT- OUR OUR- CUSTOMER CENTER- ARE. WE HAVE THE NUMBERS THAT THEY CAN BE REACHED ON IF YOU LOOK AT OUR WEBSITE WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE MORE INFORMATION. THAN ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO REACH OUT- I IMAGINE THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE WE SEND REPRESENTATIVES OUT TO CUSTOMERS THE CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMER WOULD BE ONE. TO UNDERSTAND AND FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS IT'S ONLY IF THEY'RE LISTED THEY'VE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR MEDICAL BASS LINE AND THEY'RE LISTED IN YOUR DATABASE A CRITICAL CARE STE. CUSTOMER BUT- IF THEY CALL YOUR GENERAL CUSTOMER SERVICE. HOTLINE YOU YOUR REPRESENTATIVES TOLD ME YOU WILL NOT BRING A GENERATOR OUT TO THAT FACILITY. THAT NOW WE NEED TO ESCALATE AND WE'LL ESCALATE TO THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM AND WE HAVE DONE THAT. IN THAT REQUEST HASN'T MADE IT THROUGH FOR A CRITICAL CARE RECENTLY THAT I'M AWARE OF- IT TO OUR- IS AN AMENITY TO MORE CUSTOMER CARE CENTER. BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL ESCALATE TO THE I. ANTI LEVEL. AGAIN THIS IS- IT'S A BALANCE WERE TRYING TO STRIKE YOUR SENATOR. AND WHAT MAY BE GOING BACK TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE CAN TELL THEM IN A LONGER TERM- CIRCUITS IN THESE AREAS THAT WE ARE FREQUENTLY DE ENERGIZING OR MORE FREQUENTLY ENERGIZING. WILL BE HARDENED ON A PRIORITY BASIS. SO OVER TIME WE EXPECT TO HAVE TO DO THIS LESSON LAPSED. IN THE NEAR TERM REACHING OUT TO OUR CUSTOMER LINES IN CUSTOMER CAROLINE'S. WILL ENABLE THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE IT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO HEAR THAT IN THE INCIDENT IN QUESTION- SO I. ALSO WANT TO. MAKE ONE POINT HERE- SPS IS ARE WE JUST ONE OF THE MANY WAYS THAT CUSTOMERS COULD LOSE POWER- SO THAT IS WHY WE'RE ENCOURAGING OUR CUSTOMERS TO REGISTER ON OUR WEBSITE. THAT THEY ARE MEDICAL BASELINE- CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMER- IT COULD BE AN EARTHQUAKE YOU COULD BE A MAJOR STORM- WHERE THERE WON'T BE WARNING- AND IN FACT SOME D. IMAGES ASIANS OCCUR. DURING FIRES NOT BECAUSE OUR PRINTER DO DINNER IS ATION BECAUSE LINES THEMSELVES NEIGHBOR DOWN. OR WINDS WINDS TAKE THE LINES DOWN SO OUTSIDE OF FOR A DECISION TO THE ENERGY UNDERSTOOD SO IF I'M A MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMER. AND I FIGURED OUT SOME WAY TO SIGN UP I HAVEN'T SEEN ADS BY THE WAY ALL THE BILLBOARDS DON'T TALK ABOUT SIGNING UP FOR MEDICAL BASS NAMES IN ADVERTISEMENTS ON TV ABOUT THIS I MEAN. I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHO IN THE STATE KNOWS ABOUT SIGNING UP I'VE GOT SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND. FOLKS ON MEDICAL BASELINE ESE TERRITORY BUT ON AYE HSS ALONE IN EDISON COUNTRY THERE'S THREE UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ON HSS SO CLOSING THAT. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PERSON GAP BY SUNDAY DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY SO AGAIN. HOW HOW DO PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO VULNERABLE TO LEAVE THEIR HOME AND GO TO ONE YOUR RESOURCE CENTERS. THEY CALL YOU TO WHERE THEY CALL COUNTY YEAH I I'VE HAD PEOPLE CALL YOUR ALLEN THEY SAY GO BUY A GENERATOR AND THEIR LIVES YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTED LITERACY AND GO BUY A DIESEL GENERATOR WELL WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO THIS WEEK I WOULD SAY CALL THE EDISON CUSTOMER LINE. OKAY THAT INFORMATION IS ON OUR WEBSITE AND IT'S ON THE BILL SO THAT SHOULD BE READILY AVAILABLE. F THIS SORT SUPPORT IS NOT COMING IN TIME- I WOULD SAY- THEY SHOULD BE CALLING OTHERS OF THIS OF INCLUDING NINE ONE ONE CALLS AS NECESSARY- BUT CONTINUE TO REACH OUT OUTSIDE OF EDISON. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A LIMITED ABILITY TO DELIVER GENEATORS YEAH I'M REALLY AS I USED TO HAVE IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW TO DELIVER WELL WE CONTRACT WITH THIRD PARTIES SO. MANY ONLY A WEEK IT WOULD BE- IT WOULD BE DEPENDING ON HOW MANY THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. COULD BE IN THE HUNDREDS TO THE THOUSANDS AT MOST PROBABLY NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS WE DON'T WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GENERATORS GIVE MOBILE. ADDERLEY'S LIKE ESTY JEANNIE TAKES OUT IN THE FIELD THEY TAKE THE BIG TRUCKS OUT THERE WITH A MOBILE GENERATOR ON IT AND ALSO TO DELIVER ON A COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY BASIS IS THAT. WE HAVE ACCESS TO WE DO WE HAVE DONE THAT FOR US A SENSE OF THESE CUSTOMERS THAT'S BEEN DONE FOR HOSPITALS- THAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS ARE SAID TO BE VERY BIG GENERATORS. SO OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT SUITED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS- ONE OF THINGS WE DO OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUTIS. IF THE LINE ITSELF IS ONE WE'RE DE ENERGIZED BECAUSE OF A SAFETY ISSUE. OKAY BUT GENERATOR YOU KNOW AT THE- END OF THAT LINE AND PUTTING POWER BACK DOWN THAT LINE. SIMPLY RECREATES THE PROBLEM SO IN SOME CASES IT IS TAKING POWER AWAY FROM THAT LINE. THAT IS THE OBJECTIVE UNFORTUNATELY WHICH LEADS TO THE ENERGIES ATION AND THE CUSTOMER SITUATIONS YOU DESCRIBING SENATOR JUST JUST TO BE CLEAR AND I'LL WRAP UP MISTER CHAIR BUT- SO YOU'VE GOT SAY HUNDREDS TO SAY THOUSANDS OF GENERATORS BUT YOU'VE GOT. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEDICALLY VULNERABLE PEOPLE WITHIN YOUR SERVICE TERRITORY. WHO COULD BE FACING P. S. P. S. AS SOON AS THIS WEEKEND. THEY DON'T THEY WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A GENERATOR THREE YOU ARE YOU GUYS INTERESTED AT ALL ARE OPEN TO PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE. TO GO OUT AND GET. THEM IN HERE THE COSCO WEBSITE. RIGHT I MEAN I THAT'S ALL I'M I'M JUST AN AVERAGE CONSUMER. HE SAID ON THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. IT'S THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET. A YETI THOUSAND WHAT. WITH A SOLAR SYSTEM ON IT TO LAST ME A DAY. THE CHARGE OF FOR SIX HOURS AND THAT COST ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS MORE THAN THE DIESEL DIESEL ALTERNATIVE. SO IS THERE ANY- OPENNESS TO SAY. GIVEN AN INCENTIVE TO CUSTOMERS TO JUST BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND BUY. SOME IS A LITTLE LESS DANGEROUS THAN HAVING MY GRANDMOTHER PLUG IN A DIESEL GENERATOR THESE ARE UNITS YOU CAN. PUT YOUR KITCHEN KEEP YOUR FRIDGE ON SO YOUR INSULIN DOESN'T GO BAD OR YOUR FOOD DOESN'T SPOIL. HAVE YOU ARE YOU GUYS WILLING TO OFFER ANY KIND OF INCENTIVE LIKE THAT TO THESE FOLDABLE FEET FOLKS EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE LIKE SAY THAT. THE GENERATORS TO GET TO THEM YOURSELF DIRECTLY WHEN SENATOR WHERE WHEN YOU CONSIDER. A DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT TO THINGS WE LIKE TO TALK TO YOU AND OTHERS ABOUT IS HOW WE CAN PUT A PROGRAM. IN PLACE AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING TRYING TO LOOK BROADLY AT ALL THE CUSTOMER NEEDS- ENCOURAGING RESILIENCY AND ALSO. OCCUPYING A REALISTIC SPACE IN AN HOUR PROVIDING POWER TO WHAT WE CAN REALLY DO GIVEN OUR REGION AND THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WE HAVE AND- AND WERE ACTUALLY SITTING IN TERMS OF- OF SUPPLYING POWER SO- WERE OPEN AND WE- WE WOULD WELCOME THE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AND YOUR TEAM ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO NEXT- IN A NUMBER DIFFERENT BRANCHES INCLUDING. WHAT WE MIGHT DO IN THE BACKUP GENERATOR SPITTLE LAST THING FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND- INCENTIVES SAY TO GO ON BY TEMPORARY GENERATOR BUT- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HIT WITH DEPARTING LOW CHARGES. AND OTHER FEES AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT AMOUNTS TO A FINE IF YOU DECIDE TO GO OFF THE GRID. AND INSTALL SOLAR STORAGE AT YOUR HOME AT THIS POINT- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE ADVOCATING IN THE PC GOING FORWARD ON BEHIND THE METER DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AND MICRO GRIDS WE TALKED ABOUT SB THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE IMPLEMENTATION. ARE YOU UP FOR- GETTING RID OF THOSE DEPARTING LOW CHARGES IN INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO SAY USE THIRD PARTIES TO. TO GET OFF THAT ESPECIALLY IN THESEMEDICALLY VULNERABLE HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONE SORRY I THINK JUST MAYBE BROADLY SPEAKING BACK TO DEALERS ATION AGAIN WE ARE WE ARE FOCUSED ON HEARING ALL FEEDBACK. AND LEARNING WHAT WE CAN FROM- THESE EVENTS AND OUR CUSTOMER- PAIN POINTS. OUR COMMUNITY PAIN POINTS- RELATIVE TO DISTRIBUTE ENERGY RESOURCES- BUT YOU JUST WANT TO FOR ONE THING OUT WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. D. E. OURS IN OUR SYSTEM NOW- MEDICAL WASTE LIKE REGRETS RIGHT- WE DO NOT HAVE A COLD MICROWAVE RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING A PILOT- INSURGENCY TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH A SOLAR BATTERY UNIT- THAT SHOULD BE ON. THE LINE FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR. WE'RE VERY OPEN MY GRADES IS. A HIGH COST BUT I THINK IT'S CERTAIN SOLUTIONS. CAN SITUATIONS THEY DO MAKE SENSE- BUT WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT DR AS WE CONNECT AROUND FOUR THOUSAND OF THOSE MONTH. LEAST THAT WE ARE. WE CAN DIAZ AND FRANKLY WOULD BE THOSE AS COMPONENT. CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE RED WE'RE TRYING TO LEAVE THE STORE. WE DO THINK THE DEPARTING LOW SHOULD CARRY A FAIR. SHARE OF THE FOLKS THE END. OF THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO COSTS THAT WE ENCOURAGED TO. BUILD THE SYSTEM AND ENHANCE THE SYSTEM SO THAT MIGHT BE PART OF THE DEPARTING MODE PEACE THAT WE MAKE STOP TO MAKE SURE IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE- WE'VE YOU D. E. OURS IS PART OF THE FUTURE AND- WE ENCOURAGE THEM. THANK YOU AND MISTER AND CAN I JUST WANNA WRAP UP BY SAYING. LOOK I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT BREAKING UP P. JEANNIE AND- THEY WANT TO SEE A WHOLE NEW ENTITY COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY AND THERE'S A LOT OF ANGER. I WILL TELL YOU MIGHT PERSPECTIVE DESPITE THE OUTRAGE THAT I SHARE WITH MY CONSTITUENTS. WE WANT TO SEE IT IS IN. MAKE IT THROUGH THIS AND WE'RE COUNT NO WE BELIEVE IN YOUR CORPORATE LEADERSHIP TO GET THIS DONE- I HAVE NOT LOST FAITH IN THIS. IN THIS UTILITY PERSONALLY- WE KNOW THIS IS HARD. BUT WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU TO WORK WITH US AND SORT THROUGH IS A THANK YOU FOR. I TO WORK THROUGH A VERY TOUGH PROBLEM AND HOPEFULLY THIS WEEKEND IS. BETTER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THANK YOU FOR THE INTELLIGENCE MISTER CHAIRMAN. pTHANK YOU MY SENATOR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK WE WILL TAKE TO CENTER. TAKE THIS BACK. SIR BRADFORD. THANK YOU THIS YEAR AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR MISTER INTERNET WAS GONNA GO BACK TO THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR MORLOCK GAS AS IT RELATES TO. RULE TWENTY A RULE TWENTY A FUNDS CANNOT BE USED ON ANY OF THE UNDERGROUND AND- THOSE RURAL AREAS YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE A RULE TWENTY BE OR TWENTY CITY AND- MORE. I THINK ONE MORE LINE A RULE TWENTY CITY. BUT UNDERSTANDING. THE CUSTOMER SHEARS COST IN THAT. UNDER RULE TWENTY A IT'S CALCULATED BASED ON THE NUMBER POPULATION OVER HERE FACILITIES AND URBAN AREA. ON A- COMMERCIAL STREET BUT WHEN YOU GO OFF COMMERCIAL STREET THEY BECOME A CRUEL TWENTY EIGHT ROUTE TWENTY BMI CORRECT. IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND I'M ALL FOR UNDERGROUND. WHERE IT'S FEASIBLE- BUT IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE- TASKS IT'S ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS WAS MORE THAN MILLION DOLLARS A MILE. AND ONE ISSUES I WANT TO BRING UP IS THAT WE ALL ASK FOR A NEW GROUNDING BUT YOU CREATE ANOTHER PROBLEM ONCE YOU UNDERGROUND FACILITY. OUTAGES ARE EVEN LONGER FOR THEIR TROUBLE MEANT TO RESPOND WANT TO FACILITIES UNDERGROUND SO I JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND NINE TO TEN CONSEQUENCES WE THINK. WE CAN UNDERGROUND THIS IS STILL ALL THERE INFRASTRUCTURE. WITHOUT CAUSING. LONGER DELAYS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AFTER REAL QUICK QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO- LYING CLEARING. AND THAT HAS BEEN A SUBJECT OF GREAT CONTENTION- BOTH HERE AND OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND AS A FORMER EDISON EMPLOYEE WHO REPRESENTED A URBAN AREA I KNEW THE CHALLENGES OF. ACCESSING JUST A RESIDENTIAL BACKYARD CAN YOU EXPLAIN SOME THE CHALLENGES. YOU FACE IN A WORLD WHERE AN ACCESS AND SOME YOUR FACILITIES. THOROUGHLY CENTER SITE I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE DIMENSIONS YOU SAID A RURAL AREA. SIR UNDERSTANDABLY- PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR TREES ARE VEGETATION- SO ACCESS CAN BE SOMETHING OF A CHALLENGE- MANY OR IS THAT WE ARE CLEARING ARE NOT- A CUSTOMER OWN THEY'RE ACTUALLY ON NATIONAL FOREST LAND AND AREAS- SUCH AS THAT SO- WE HAVE TO WORK TO PERMITTING PROCESSES TO GET- GET PERMISSION TO CLEAR VEGETATION THOSE AREAS- BUT EVEN WHILE AND URBAN INTERFACE- VEGETATION CLEARING- IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE- WE ULTIMATELY ARE MOVING OUR CLEARANCE DISTANCES WHICH CAN BE PERCEIVED AS A AS A SHOCK TO SOME WHO HAVE SEEN BUDGETARY SOME CLEARANCE- OVER THE YEARS AT A MUCH LOWER DISTANCE FROM TREES BUT WE'VE- CONCLUDED THAT- MORE DISTANCE IS BETTER IT. KEEPS A SAFER- SO I'D SAY DOING- IN GAUGING WITH CUSTOMERS ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITIES HELPING. THEM UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING THIS IS PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES- WE ARE WE HAVE RAMPED UP DRAMATICALLY OUR VEGETATION CRUZ I THINK PRICE BETTER BOOK SOON. SEE WHAT THE LARGE UNDERTAKING IS A WE HAVE CLOSE TO MILLION TREES IN OUR TRIM INVENTORY- WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED CRUISE ATTITUDE A THREE MAN CREW WORKING ON THESE UP ALL TO ALL THE TIME SO THIS IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT WE'RE DOING SO THERE'S LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. OB BUT IT'S ONE OF OUR IMPORTANT PROGRAMS IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE ENHANCED IT- OVER THE LAST YEAR YEAR AND A HALF- AND IT'S AGAIN ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS ARE. WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. SO I ONE SUGGESTION AS IT RELATES TO LINE CLEAR AND THE COST THAT'S BEING INCURRED SPECIALLY WITHOUT OUT OF STATE CONTRACTORS. ALLIES IN SOME OF THE SAME INMATES THERE ON THE FIRE LINES THAT FIGHT THESE FIRES INTO A LOT A LINE CLEARING WHY WOULD YOU NOT CONTRACT WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND ALLOW THEM TO DO IT VERSUS BRINGING IN ALL THESE OUT OF STATE CONTRACTORS. AND DRIVING THE COST UP- WE HAVE FIVE IN A LOT OF AREAS- NOT JUST OF VEGETATION CLEARANCE BUT- OVERALL CREWS THAT ACTUALLY DO THE WORK- WE HAVE RAMPED UP OUR HIRING IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE AS WELL FOR THOSE SO WE WOULD CERTAINLY. WANT TO BRING AS MANY RESOURCES WE CAN ON THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FRONT AND WE ARE WILL CONTINUE TO HIRE THEIR. IT'S A WEEK I WOULD SAY WE HAVE PREFERENCE IN STATE OUT OF STATE BUT- WE'VE- PROBABLY HARD AS MANY FOLKS AS WE CAN IN STATE. AND THE OUT OF STATE- CREWS ARE MAKING UP SOME OF THE SAUCE OR YOU OPPOSED TO THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED TO BEING PART OF THAT BECAUSE THAT'S ON THE CHALLENGES THESE FOLKS DO THAT WHILE THEY'RE IN PARTS RATED BUT ONCE THEY'RE- FREE AND OUT. THEY SEEM TO NOT BILL TO GET A JOB DOING EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID WHAT THEY WERE INCARCERATED. CENTER WE'D WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT ONE I DON'T HAVE A- DO YOU ON THAT AT THIS POINT. THE RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- HI ONE ADDRESS TWO ISSUES AS IT RELATES TO THE SAFETY OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY IT AS IT PERTAINS TO THE PSP HAS PROGRAM AND TALK SLOW IT RELATES LIMIT TO A MISTER- STERN SAID. REGARDS TO HIS GRANDMOTHER- OF COURSE SHE WAS LIKE ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMEONE TO GO TO BUT MY QUESTION IS THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT CONSISTENTLY COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATION BUT- I'M JUST WONDERING WERE HAVING AN ISSUE OF NOT. FIFTEEN COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS NUMBER TWO IS A TRUST ISSUE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE CENTERS ARE- AND I KNOW THAT MOST LOCAL COMMUNITIES ALREADY HAVE PROGRAMS IN THE DEAL EMERGENCY DRILLS FOR. EITHER EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER STUFF RIGHT SO THEY ALREADY HAVE SORT OF A SYSTEM IN PLACE WHERE- IF NOT I'LL SPEAK TO MY OWN COMMUNITIES I KNOW THAT OUR SENIOR CENTER IS TO PICK UP OUR SENIORS EIGHT. THEY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE OUT THE KNOLL HOW TO GET IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER IN OUR SENIORS IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE ALREADY TRUSTS OUR COMMUNITY CENTER HAVE YOU CONSIDERED PARTNER WITH CITIES AND ALLOWING THEM TO RUN THEIR OWN CENTERS AND PERHAPS REIMBURSE SOME. AFTER THE FACT YEAH ON CO SENATOR I'M NOT SURE. BACK UP WE HAVE IN THE INSTANCES THAT WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN PARTNERED WITH- CERTAIN COMMUNITIES POINTS THAT MAY HAVE- SOME INFRASTRUCTURE LIBRARY OR SOMETHING ALREADY OPEN AND NO THAT'S NOT NOT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO RIGHT OW- ONE OF OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS IS THE RED CROSS SO WE'RE TEAMING WITH THE RED CROSS. IN BUILDING OUT ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS- WE'RE OPEN TO ANY AND ALL PROGRAMS AGAIN WE ARE HERE TO SEEK FEEDBACK AND THAT'S PROGRAM THAT WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED CENTER RUBIO AND LIKE TO FOLLOW IF YOU AND YOUR TEAM. A WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE- PART OF OUR MEDICAL BASELINE PROGRAM IS TO PARTNER WITH COMMUNTY ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY. BEEN PARTNERED WITH DIDN'T TO OUR HELP OUR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WE ARE LEVERAGING THOSE MECHANISMS- AND THOSE PROGRAMS AND- AND PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE- WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AS MUCH AS WE CAN- I THINK IS THE C. R. C. IT'S NOT ONLY A- WE'VE GOT THOSE WITH KMART AND SEARS AND ARE. LOOKING AT SOME OTHER RETAILERS THAT WE CAN I HAVE THE CENTERS. IN TO A PROVIDE. SERVICES. CAN FACILITIES AND OTHER THINGS TO HELP PEOPLE ON THE INCIDENT. BUT LEVERAGING MORE MORE RESOURCES ARE UP AND RUNNING UP WERE VERY VERY OPEN TO THAT. WELL AND I'VE HEARD A YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE RED CROSS Là YOU KNOW VERY MUCH I KNOW THEY DO A LOT FOR COMMITTEES BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITHOUT PROGRAMS WHERE. THEY GIVE VOUCHERS FOR VICTIMS TO STAND HOTELS IN OUR COMMITTEES WILL NOT REACH OUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY TRUST YOU'RE GONNA STATION. FOR VARIOUS REASONS FOR THEM IT'S A COMFORT ISSUE. LIBRARIES IT'S NOT A COMFORT ZONE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LIKE A- SENIOR CENTER COMMUNITY CENTERS ALREADY THERE'S A TRUST FACTOR. THEY ALREADY KNOW WHO THESE FOLKS ARE THEY HAVE THEIR PHONE NUMBERS IT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF LET'S SAY. CONNECTION AND SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT INSTEAD OF SPENDING A WILL TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS OR NOT THERE ALREADY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE BUT- YOU KNOW JUST WANT TO PUT IT ON YOUR RADAR THEY ALREADY. HAVE THE CONNECTION THEY ALREADY KNOW THE SENIORS AND MEDICALLY FRONT FRAGILE INDIVIDUALS ARE- THEY ALREADY HAVE THEIR STAFF IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF JUST. LETTING THEM HANDLE IT AND THEN MAYBE GET REIMBURSED LATER INSTEAD OF SPENDING MONEY ELSEWHERE. SENATOR THAT CD KIND OF PARTNERSHIP AND STRUCTURE THAT WE REALLY ARE LOOKING TO- TO- TEAM UP WITH. AND PROVIDE A WAY OF GETTING MORE MORE INFORMATION AND POTENTIALLY. RESOURCE OF THESE COMMUNITIES OUT I GUESS ARE JUST REQUEST THAT UP PERHAPS AFTER THE SESSION. WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH YOU AND OUR OUR TEAM TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND EXPLORE THAT. WE'VE COVERED A LOS LIST AND THERE ARE MANY MANY THINGS IN OUR PROGRAM- THAT HAVE COME FROM DIALOGUE SUCH AS THIS SORT OF HELP INFORM US. AS TO WAYS TO MAKE A PROGRAM BETTER- UNLESS IMPACT OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE CARE ABOUT. I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THEM- PERHAPS SOMETHING HAS BEEN DONE. ACROSS OUR COMPANY THAT THE NAVY IS ADVANCE SAID AGAIN I DID MENTION- WE'VE COMMUNITY. TEAMED UP WITH A NUMBER COMMUNITIES AS PART OF OUR. IT'S ALL COMMUNITY SO. THIS IS A HAVING COMMITTEE SEES ME THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY VERY OPEN TO LEVERAGING OUR PARTNERSHIPS I KNOW OUR- THE GIVING ASPECTS OF OUR ORGANIZATION. ARE TEAMING UP BUT WE MAY BE MISSING SOMETHING TO TEAR YOU'RE LOOKING AT SPECIFICALLY SO. PLEASE HELP US OUT AND THANK YOU. AND CAL CENTER GALGIANI- THIS IS JUST A CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION THAT I OFFER THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION EVERY YEAR HAS DONE AS- A CALIFORNIA DENTAL CARES AND- THEY HAVE THESE- DENTAL FAIRS AROUND THE STATE WHERE THEY INVITE NOW THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS TO COME AND GET CARE FOR THE DAY. THEY HAVE BECOME EXPERTS AT TRIAGE BEING PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP WITH WHATEVER DENTAL NEED IT WOULD BE WHETHER IT'S FROM EXTRACTING A TOOTH OR PROVIDING AN IMPLANT OR DEALING WITH AN INFECTION. THE POINT BEING THAT. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE RED CROSS AND HOUSING PIECE OF T BUT THE DENTAL ASSOCIATION PUTS TOGETHER WHERE THEY TRIAGE. DENTAL NEEDS WHICH HAS A PARALLEL WITH THE NEEDS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SERVE WHEN IT COMES TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE. THE MEDICAL NEEDS MEDICATIONS OF BEING ON AN OX OF THE OXYGEN TANK WHATEVER IT WOULD BE SO IT JUST WOULD SEEN THAT. THERE COULD BE SOME LESSONS LEARNED I ATTENDED A SOME OF THESE MANY YEARS AGO TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND I ATTENDED. JUST AGAIN LAST YEAR AND IN THE. JEAN NUMBER BAY GROWN IMMENSELY AND THE ABILITY TO AND TRIAGE THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS ALL AT ONCE EIGHT WITH SUCH SMOOTH TRANSITION I WOULD THINK THAT YOU COULD JUST. HAVE SOME TIPS THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL CONSTRUCTIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR APPRECIATE THAT SUGGESTION AS WELL THANK YOU. SENATOR WINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. SO I APPRECIATE- THAT YOU EXPRESSED- EDISON'S- DESIRE TO EXPAND- ENERGY STORAGE TO THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON DIESEL GENERATORS AND- AND CAN HAVE THAT BACK UP BOB POWER WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT- SO UNFORTUNATELY MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN I MENTIONED THIS IN MY OPENING AROUND P. GINNY BUT ALSO RELATES ADDISON- THAT- EDISON HAS- NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN BEEN VERY OPPOSITIONAL TO EFFORTS TO EXPAND- DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES SUCH AS ENERGY STORAGE- AND WE WERE ABLE TO PASS- SB SEVEN HUNDRED TO RENEW THE ESTá PROGRAM AND I APPRECIATE THAT DESCENDED WORK WITH US- ON THAT SO THANK YOU. BUT UNFORTUNATELY ADDISON ALONG WITH PGA ANY- HAS AND I BELIEVE US TO GINNY AS WELL- HAS DOZENS GONE INTO THE SI PC- AND- VACATED FOR NOT FULLY FUNDING- AS CHIP- AND SPECIFICALLY- ADDISON HAS PROPOSED- DIED IT SHOULD BE DONE BEAUTIFULLY EYES INDEPENDENT TO YOUR PROGRAMS YOU PROJECT FOR TWO YEARS AND YOU FUNDED REDUCTION FUND THAT WAS OF COURSE COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE POINT OF THE PROGRAM THE BEST IS A YOU HAVE A LONG ENOUGH ONE WAY. THAT THE INDUSTRY WERE WILL RELY ON IT AND IN A VERY AND OF INVEST SO THAT WECAN MAKE I HAVE BETTER ENERGY STORAGE AND CHEAPER ENERGY STORAGE- SO GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH THESE BLACKOUTS AND THE NEED TO HAVE A CLEAN ENERGY STORAGE AND SET OF DIESEL GENERATORS- CAN I CAL ON ADDISON TO STOP OPPOSING THE FULL FUNDING ABOUT CHIP IN THE STOP OPPOSING THE EXPANSION. OF THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. SO AT THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER AND I. DON'T HAVE A- PRICE OR TEMA DE IS WITH ME TODAY SO WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE I JUST. DID YOU WANT TO COME BACK TO- BUT WHAT I DO IS- A RELATIVE OR OF US SUPPORT FOR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES NOT WITHSTANDING ASKED HIM- I MEANT TO THE NUMBERS OF. FOLKS WE HAVE ONLINE- WE JUST RELEASED OUR COMMUNITY PATHWAY. A DOCUMENT IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE CRITICALITY WHO DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AS PART OF A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA SO. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE- I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THE UNDERSTAND. SOME OF THE- SPECIFICS THAT ARE LEADING TO NOT SUPPORTING FULL FUNDING OF THAT PROGRAM. SO I FIGURED I MEAN THE I. R. USE OUR VIEW AT SOME SORT OF THREAT- AND FRANKLY THE REASON THAT THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE WAS SO SUCCESSFUL IN THE AND HELPING. DEPLOY THAT SOLAR IS BECAUSE IT HAD A LONG ENOUGH RUNWAY AND WAS FULLY FUNDED- BUT THE EFFORTS OF BY THE UTILITIES TO UNDERMINE ITS TIP IS VERY PROBLEMATIC AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT. THANK CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THE LAST BILL JOHNSON AND THE- P. GINNY TEAM TO. COME FORWARD NOW. PUT ME DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR HIM IN. YEAH WITH ALL THAT. YEAH AND THE SHOW HERE YOU WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS THANK YOU FOR CONVENING US TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AS YOU MIGHT CAN TELL NOT IN FULL VOICE TODAY. HOW DO MY BEST I'M HERE THEY WERE SEVERAL MY COLLEAGUES OR GMO NOW WHO IS OUR CHIEF CUSTOMER OFFICER. AND SHE MEETS SAYING WHO IS THE VP IN CHARGE OF THE COMMITTEE WELL FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM. AND WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT LAST MONTH'S PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF VINCE INITIATED BY PEACHY IN A- THESE EVENTS RESULT IN TURNING UP POWER FOR SAFETY ON FIVE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. OVER FIVE WEEKS AFFECTING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AS A POINT OF COMPARISON P. JEANNIE ONLY DEAR JUDGE ONE TIME. PRIOR TO TWENTY NINETY SO THIS IS RELATIVELY NEW TO US ALL. PART OF MY REPORTER ALSO DESCRIBED THE BASIS FOR THESE DECISIONS ALONG WITH THE SCALE AND DURATION OF THE SHOT OFF AND ARE RESTORATION WORK. AND I'LL SHARE THE LESSONS WE LEARNED ABOUT BETTER MANAGING THESE EVENTS AND REDUCING THEIR IMPACT. THE NEXT TIME EXTREME WEATHER REQUIRES FACING SUCH DECISIONS AGAIN. AND FINALLY I WANT TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION THAT ARE. PER COLLEAGUES HAD ABOUT HOW WE'RE WORKING TOWARD A FUTURE WHERE THE KIND OF LARGE SCALE SHUT OFF WE'VE EXPERIENCED. ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY. PARDON ME. FIRST LET ME EMPHASIZE A BASIC FACT IT. REALLY SHOULD BE OBVIOUS BY THINGS EASILY LOST IN THE TURBULENT ATMOSPHERE AROUND THIS. WE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO TURN ANYBODY'S POWER OFF. IT'S THE LAND OF HIS GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS IS NOT THE WAY WE WANT TO SERVE CUSTOMERS WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. AND WE RECOGNIZE THE LIVING WITHOUT POWER IS MORE THAN JUST AN INCONVENIENCE FOR MANY IS A HARDSHIP. WITH POTENTIALLY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FROM DISRUPTED ROUTINES AND SCHOOL CLOSURES. STRAINED BUDGETS AND LOST INCOME AND FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US. THOSE WHO DEPEND ON LIFE SUSTAINING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CANNOT AFFORD TO REPLACE LOST FOOD. LOSING POWER FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD CAN COME WITH CONSIDERABLE FEAR AND SAFETY RISKS. SO NONE OF US WANT TO LIVE IN THAT WORLD. BUT WE'RE DOING THIS WITH THE SINGULAR PURPOSE OF PREVENTING THE DEADLY CATASTROPHIC FIRES WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS. NONE OF US WANTS TO SEE THOSE HAPPEN AGAIN EITHER. I THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH A MOMENT HERE TO. LOOK AT HOW WE GOT TO THIS POINT CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY IN THE SPEED OF CHANGE AROUND US. OVER THE PAST FEWYEARS THE WILD FIRE RISK IN OUR SERVICE AREA ALONE HAS INCREASED AT A RATE THAT FEW. COULD IMAGINE. REGIONALES TWENTY TWELVE THE PARTS OF THE STATE DESIGNATED AS HAVING AN ELEVATED RISK OF WILDFIRE MADE UP LESS THAN 15% OF P. JEANNIE SERVICE AREA. IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. IN FACT IN TWENTY TEN- TWELVE IN DEALING WITH THE S. P. S. IMMENSELY AT A DIFFERENT NAME THEN. THE CPUC SAID THIS QUOTE THERE'S NO HISTORY OF CATASTROPHIC POWER LINE FIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T EXPERIENCE THE SANTA ANA WINDS TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC POWER LINE FIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT CHANGED AND CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND FIRES BURNED ACROSS CALIFORNIA BURNED TWO MILLION ACRES. AND ALTHOUGH ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT HISTORICALLY HAS BECAUSE LESS THAN 10% OF WILDFIRES. ACCOUNT FOR ROUGHLY HALF OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. AND NEED AS BROAD PS PS TO THE FORE AS A TOOL TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY PARTICULARLY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR P. GINNY AS CUSTOMERS WHY THE INCREASE IN PS PS EVENTS. BECAUSE THE RISK OF FIRE HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY TODAY THAT RISK FOOTPRINT OF LESS THAN 15% TWENTY TWELVE. DOWN VALVES MORE THAN 50% OF PIGEON A SYSTEM. THAT'S SYSTEM COVER SEVENTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND AND FORTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF HIGH FIRE THREAT AREA. LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE. THE RISK EXPOSURE THIS ENERGY NETWORK CONSERVE SIXTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IS MORE THAN TRIPLE A 3100% INCREASE. OVER APPEAR THAT MOST COMPANIES IN THIS INDUSTRY WOULD CONSIDER THE BLINK OF AN EYE. AND SO WE HAVE TO COPE WITH THIS HEIGHTENED RISK THE BEST THAT WE CAN AND TURNING UP POWER FOR SAFETY IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL. AS OUR COLLEAGUE SAID EARLIER REALLY ONLY ONE OFTHE MANY TOOLS WERE USING. TO BRING DOWN THE RISK OF HIGH WINDS DRY CONDITIONS AND ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT THAT CAN CAUSE A SPARK. AND WE WILL GET BETTER USING. SO WHAT IS THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY WHAT SORT OF SHAPE IS IT IN AND HOW WELL SUITED ISN'T TO THIS NEW LEVEL OF RISK. FIRST THERE'S A PERCEPTION AND I HEARD HERE TODAY. THAT OUR SYSTEM IS IN SHAMBLES THAT WE HAVEN'T INVESTED IN. AND THAT WE'RE TURNING OFF THE POWER BECAUSE WE'VE NEGLECTED THE EQUIPMENT. SO I'VE HEARD THIS A LOT I'VE BEEN HERE SIX MONTHS. EVER DISALLOWED THAT SIX MONTHS AND I OF MOSTLY AVOIDED ANSWERING THIS QUESTION BY SAYING I CAME TO LOOK FORWARD NOT BACK. OF. BUT I GOT IT HAS SO MANY TIMES I THOUGHT I WOULD INVESTIGATE WHAT THE FACTS. AND SO HERE THE FAX OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS P. GINNY HAS INVESTED MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. IN HIS ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION ASSETS. IN UTILITY SPACE PROFITS ARE GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS EARNING THE RETURN THE COMMISSION SUCH FOR YOU. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS FUSION IS TAKEN TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT RETURN. AND PUT IT BACK INTO THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM SO I CAN PUT THIS IN ANY GREATER CONTEXT FOR YOU BUT THOSE ARE SORT OF THE NUMBERS OF WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. MORE RECENTLY HE WE FINISHED AN UNPRECEDENTED PROCESS TO INSPECT EVERY ELEMENT OF OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM WITHIN THE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. WE INSPECTED ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION SUBSTATIONS STRUCTURES. OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION DISCRETE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS. WE CLIMB THESE THINGS WE USE DRONES WE PERFORMED EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF INSPECTIONS IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS. WHATEVER WE FOUND EQUIPMENT THE NEEDED IMMEDIATE REPAIR WE FIXED OR REPLACED. WE'LL BE SURE THAT EVERY PIECE OF ELECTORAL QUITMAN WITHIN THE NEXT TO THE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREA IS SUITABLE TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND SYSTEM. ON MANAGING VEGETATION LONG RIGHT AWAY AS ALONE WE SPENT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. THE LAST TWO YEARS WE TRIMMED ALMOST SEVEN MILLION TREES REMOVED A HALF A MILLION DEAD TREES. ARE VEGETATION CLEARANCE EFFORT SUCCEEDS THEY REQUIRE. BUT THE FACT IS NO MAN OF TREE CLEARING CAN PREVENT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ARE WINDBLOWN DEBRIS FROM HITTING AND IMPACTING OUR CLICK. TWO ENORMOUS THERE ARE WORK WILL NEVER BE DONE WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY OR DETERMINE TO GET A RIGHT. BUT WE BELIEVE WE MAKE IT MAY GET A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RISK WITH THESE PS PS VENTS. SO NOW FEW SPECIFICS ABOUT THE OCTOBER EVENTS. NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AFFECTED NAY ANYONE'S FIJIAN AVAIL WAS NINE HUNDRED FORTY ONE THOUSAND AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THOSE OR ACCOUNTS WERE METERS SO YOU CAN MULTIPLY THAT ROUGHLY BY TWO AND A HALF TIMES TO GET TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED WHICH IS REALLY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. OUR RECORDS SHOW THE LONGER STUDIES PERIOD WAS FIVE DAYS AGAIN DURING THE FINAL WEEK OF OCTOBER WHEN WE SAW TWO METEOROLOGICAL SYSTEMS. THE SEVERE WINDS ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS APART. EXTREME WEATHER THE PROPERTIES TO SHUT OFF WAS A ONE IN THIRTY YEAR VAN WITH SOME OF THE STRONGEST WINDS EVER RECORDED IN THE REGION. INCLUDING GUSTIN SONMA COUNTY OF A HUNDRED TWO MILES AN HOUR. AND OVER SEVENTY MILE OUR IN MANY OTHER PLACES HUMIDITY LEVELS WERE EXTREMELY LOW. WITH BONE DRY AIR MORE TYPICAL OF THE MOJAVE DESERT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN HIS HISTORIC WIN SUBSIDED MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND FIELD PERSONNEL ALONG WITH MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED MUTUALLY TEAMS FROM THE INDUSTRY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. INSPECTED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND SORT OF MILES OF TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO CIRCLE THE EARTH. FOUND HUNDREDS OF INSTANCES OF EQUIPMENT DAMAGE TO THE LECTURES. PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF TREES AND BRANCHES INTO OUR LINES FROM BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RIGHT AWAY. CHINESE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS FIERCE WINDS NEAR ZERO HUMIDITY IN THE PARTIAL LANDSCAPE. PARDON ME THESE TYPES OF HAZARDS COULD HAVE SPARKED THE DEADLY CATASTROPHIC FIRE. AND PREVENTING THIS OUTCOME IS EXACTLY AND THE SOLE REASON WE CALL THESE P. S. P. S. OF IT. PUBLIC SAFETY IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IN OUR PRIORITY MUST BE TO PROTECT HUMAN LIVES. ABOVE ALL ELSE. LOOKING BACK OVER THESE EVENTS WE KNOW OUR PERFORMANCE WASN'T PERFECT. THE. PARTICULARLY IN THE OCTOBER NINTH EVENT AND NOW WE CAN AND WILL AND HAVE TO DO BETTER FOR EXAMPLE OUR WEBSITE CRASH SEVERAL TIMES. OUR MAPS WERE INCONSISTENT OR CALL CENTERS ROVER LOADED MAINLY AFFECTED BY THE WEBSITE PROBLEMS. OUR LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION WITH THE RELEVANT STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL AGENCIES FELL SHORT OF THE MARK. AND WE LEARN FROM THE SHORTCOMINGS IN FAILURES WE LISTEN TO SEE BACK WE'VE RECEIVED. AND WE PERFORMED OUR WE'VE IMPROVED OUR PERFORMANCE EACH TIME. THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS LATER IN THE MONTH DEMONSTRATED THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TOGETHER. TO GET BETTER SO ARE WE DOING TO GET BETTER. OUR PS PS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN EXPANDED REFINED TO REACH MORE PEOPLE MORE RELIABLY. OUR WEBSITE AND CALL CENTERS ARE NOW WE WILL HAVE A MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF TRAFFIC AND DID SO WITHOUT INCIDENT IN THE LATER EVENTS. SHARPENING THE QUALITY OF OUR OUTREACH MAPS. AND WE'VE IMPROVE COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH A GOVERNMENT AGENCY PARTNERS INCLUDING WELCOMING MEMBERS OF CAL- YES CAL FIRE AND THE CPC TO WORK ALONGSIDE US. IN OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER. BUT THERE'S A LARGER LESSON TO BE DRAWN HERE ONE THAT WE UNDERSTAND EQUALLY WELL AND THAT IS REPEATEDLY TURNING OFF POWER FROM MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. IN ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD EVEN IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY. IS NOTA SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION TO THE WILDFIRE THREATS WE FACE. CHAU ASSURE YOU OF THIS WE DO NOT EXPECT AN ANNUAL REPEAT OF WHAT WE WENT THROUGH THIS OCTOBER. AND WHAT WE PUT OUR CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS THROUGH THAT JUST CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN. WE'RE WORKING TO NARROW THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF FUTURE SAFETY SHUT OFFS AND MINIMIZE YOUR CUSTOMER IMPACT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WE'RE HARNESSING NEW TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP US DO THAT INCLUDING MORE WEATHER STATIONS AND CAMERAS TO PROVIDE MORE PRECISE LOCAL DATA. AS WELL AS SEXUAL LODGING DEVICES AND TEMPORARY GENERATION THAT ALLOW US TO TARGET THE SHUT OFF AND KEEP THE POWER ON FOR MORE PEOPLE. THE SINGLE. HELP THEY'LL HELP TREMENDOUSLY EVEN BEFORE NEXT FIRE SEASON. IN FACT WE HAVE A SIMILAR HISTORIC WINDOW VENT NEXT OCTOBER WE BELIEVE THE WORK THEY WERESCOPING RIGHT NOW CAN REDUCE THAT OVERALL THE FOOTPRINT BY AT LEAST ONE THE- EVER THINKING CREATIVELY ABOUT OTHER WAYS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES GET THROUGH THESE OUTAGES WITH LESS HARM AN INCONVENIENCE. WE'LL SPAR PARTNERSHIPS FROM THE STATE TO ACHIEVE THESE IMPROVEMENTS. BUT THAT'S THE PACE OF CHANGE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THE NEAR TERM OVER THE LONGER TERM WILL CONTINUE TO HARDEN OUR SYSTEM IS STRONG THE WIRES AND POLES MANAGING VEGETATION. AND PUTTING MORE OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE UNDERGROUND CERTAIN AREAS. SO CLOSE I WANT TO ASSURE EVERYONE THE CHALLENGE OF PROVIDING ELECTRIC SERVICE IN AN INCREASINGLY HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT IS ONE THAT OUR COMPANY MUST AND WILL MASTER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. THIS ISSUE THAT WE AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. WE MEETING ON MY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND COLLEAGUES IN THE GYM NAY AT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING THAT CHALLENGE SQUARELY AND WE WELCOME THE ATTENTION OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT WE'LL BE GLAD TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BEGIN WITH OUR VICE CHAIR CENTER MORE LUCK I'M SORRY WITH BECAUSE CENTER NIELSEN OR REGISTER. SORRY MR JOHNSON I APPRECIATE YOUR. DESIRE AND FOCUS ON THE HEAD AND INDEED WE MUST WE CAN'T LOOK AHEAD WITHOUT LOOKING A LITTLE BIT BACK. IN IT IS A LITTLE BIT UNNERVING TO ME THAT. SO MANY THESE THINGS THAT. YOU AND OTHERS HAVE IMPLEMENTED. ONLY OCCUR WHEN WE'VE HAD THIS TREMENDOUS FIRE. PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. NOW THE FIRE PROBLEM INTO DEVELOPING FOR DECADES GLOBAL WARMING FOR MORE THAN DECADES. AND THE ACCUMULATION OF FUELS AND ARE FORCING A WHILE LANCE MANY DECADES. AND BY THE WAY THAT'S A STATE AND FEDERAL PROBLEM TOO AND THIS COMMITTEE WOULD BE DOING A DISSERVICE IF WE DO NOT. EXAMINE STATE AND FEDERAL pACCUMULATION OF FUELS. SOMETHING THAT DOES AFFECT YOU BUT YOU DON'T SO ENTIRELY CONTROL. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT TO THE POINT THE COMMUNICATIONS. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT SUCH DISASTERS COULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED AND COMMUNICATION MECHANISMS AND PRIORITIZE HAITIANS IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED AND EXIT AT YOUR EXIGENCY SET UP FOR THAT IN ADVANCE. IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THIS IS REALLY BEEN GOING ON THE WAY. UP FOR EXAMPLE THIS NOTIFICATION OF THE NEXT ROUND THAT WAS FAR BETTER THAN THE ONES THAT I'VE RECEIVED BEFORE. SO YOU ARE IMPROVE. BUT IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN. ANTICIPATED AND IF THE COMMUNICATION THAT WAS KIND OF ONE OF THE GREAT IRONIES THAT I'VE RECALL. THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL CONFERENCE CALLS WITH LEADERS ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. ONE OF THE FIRST CONFERENCE CALLS FAILED. EVEN THE CONFERENCE CALL. DIDN'T WORK. AND THAT CERTAINLY CONCERNED ME A LITTLE BIT. AND THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER THING THAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED. THE LOCATIONS OF THEM HOME HAVE BEEN INCONVENIENT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOME. AND WE'VE HAD AN AWFUL LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEM RUNNING OUT OF SUPPLIES SO WHAT IS THE VALUE OF IT. IF THE SUPPLIES HAVE DIMINISHED OR NOT AVAILABLE. AND THEY'RE NOT AS ACCESSIBLE. BUT JUST A FEW WOULD HAZARD SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THAT AND- THOSE POINTS THAT I'VE RACED. CERTAINLY THANK SENATOR- COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL AS I SAID THIS IS ALL RELATIVELY NEW TO US. WE STARTED THIS YEAR WITH SEVERAL SMALL EVENTS. ON THE ORDER OF WENT WELL. AND SO I THINK WE GOT A LITTLE COMPLACENT WE HAD FIGURED OUT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SCALED UP TO. YOU KNOW TWENTY TIMES THAT SIZE. IN THE NEXT EVENT- THE OTHER THING AND JUST AN OBSERVATION. I THINK WE. THOUGHT THE BIG EVENT WAS TURNING OFF THE POWER BECAUSE FOR US THIS IS AN UNNATURAL ACT HEROES IN UTILITY BUSINESS YOUR JOB IS TO KEEP THE POWER ON TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. I THINK WE FOCUSED ON THAT IS THE MAIN EVENT INSTEAD OF THE IMPACT OF THAT. RIGHT ON THE ON THE PEOPLE IN AFFECTED SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE TWO SORT OF BASIC LEARNINGS WE WEREN'T AS WELL AS WE THOUGHT. AND WE NEED TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION A LOT MORE ATTENTION TO. IMPACTS HAVE TO SHUT THE POWER OFF AND I DO THINK AS THINGS WENT ON WE GOT BETTER AND EACH ONE OF THESE. HOPING NEVER TO MASTER IT. BUT I THINK WE HAD BETTER. WELL AGAIN JUST TO CLOSE ON MY POINT THOUGH. WE HAVE GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS NOT THE NEW NORMAL THE STATE CANNOT TOLERATE THIS AS THE NEW. IT MAY BE CERTAINLY NEW TO YOU COMING FROM BACK EAST AND MAYBE NOT HAVING FACED THIS. I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH IT MY WHOLE LIFE. HAVING REPRESENTED EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MANY FIRES FLOODS AND OTHER DISASTERS I'VE HAD TO CONTEND WITH. AND THIS IS AN ONGOING THING IN THESE COMMUNITIES NEVER HAD WE HAD ONE SO DEVASTATING IS PARADISE. BUT ALL OF THE FUEL IS OUT THERE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. SO I'M VERY WARY ABOUT IT AND AS WE ANTICIPATE WE NEED TO HAVE SOME VERY DEEP THINKING AND AGAIN. I SUBMIT THINKING ABOUT THE STATE AND FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED AS WELL. BUT THE COMMUNICATION IS STILL DEFICIENT AND PEOPLE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY WORRIED AND RIGHTEOUSLY VERY ANGRY. AND MANY HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES. THANK YOU SIR MORE LUCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON- IN IN YOUR REMARKS I DID NOT HEAR TERMS LIKE SECTIONAL EYES OR FAST. ACTING FUSES OR POWER TO BURGERS OR RAPID EARTH FAULT CURRENT LIMITERS- COULD YOU MAYBE HELP ME OUT AND WHAT YOU SPENT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS ON IN THE LAST. TEN YEARS. WELL AS I SAID BUT ALL I COULD DO IS FIND THE NUMBERS I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WHEN I KNOW SOME OF THE WENT ON SEXUAL ISING I DON'T THINK ANY OF IT WENT ON TO THE MODERN SORT OF FALL INTERRUPTION DEVICE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY THOSE BUT WE'RE LOOKING ATTHAT TOO- BUT BASICALLY I THINK WE JUST SPENT ON. MAINTAINING AND BUILDING THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM. SO THE COME. BEING FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE COMPLAINT I HEARD THE MOST OFTEN WAS THAT. YOUR PS PS IS WERE. VERY BROAD THEY WEREN'T FOCUSED. COULD YOU EXPLAIN DEBT THAT ACCURATE OR CORRECT. ALL WILL START AND THEN I WILL. RELY ON MY AT MY EXPERT HERE THERE'S A COUPLE OF BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SYSTEMS. THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE THE STAKES TAKING OUT TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS PIECES BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO IMPACT A LOT MORE PEOPLE. SO WE HAVE A DIFFERENT SYSTEM. WE DON'T HAVE THE TEN YEARS OF SPECIFIC WEATHER DATA THAT SDG AND HE TALKED ABOUT WE HAVE GENERAL DATA- BUT I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SYSTEM REALLY ACCOUNTS FOR. THE SCOPE OF THESE EVENTS FOR THEM YES. DOCTOR SAYING HERE TO SPEAK TO ME. DISCUSS THE SCOPE AND I COMMITTEE GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION CENTERED IN BECAUSE REGARD TO THE THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS AS WELLAS THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS SO THAT YOU REFERENCE REGARDING FAST ACTING FUSES RAPTOR FALL CURRENT LIMITER AND THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS AND THE WORK THAT WE HAVE. IN PLAN GOING FORWARD IN REGARDS TO THE SCOPE- WE ARE- QUICKLY ADVANCING OUR CAPABILITIES FROM A SITUATION AWARENESS AND REAL TIME MONITORING- BASIS AS WE'VE HEARD- AND LEARN FROM THE BEST PRACTICES FROM SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS WE'VE INSTALLED NEARLY SIX HUNDRED WEATHER STATIONS WE'VE DONE A THIRTY YEAR. CLIMATOLOGY STUDY WE'VE- ESTABLISHED EIGHTY DIFFERENT BILLION DATA POINTS SO WE LEVERAGE NOW FOR THE PURPOSES OF WEATHER FORECASTING THAT DOES GIVE US A MORE TARGETED AND GRANULAR VIEW- IN TERMS OF WHERE ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE POTENTIAL A HIGH FIRE RISK- WILL GIVE YOU TWO DIFFERENT DATA POINTS TO COMPARE SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LARGEST EVENT THAT WE HAD IN OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH. WE HAD DONE NINE AND FORTY THOUSAND AND AGAIN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS- SO A LOT MORE CUSTOMERS THAT WERE IMPACTED IF YOU LOOK AT THE RED FLAG WARNING FOOTPRINT WITHIN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SERVICE TERRITORY THAT WOULD HAVE AMOUNTED TO ABOUT TWO POINT TWO MILLION CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS SO WE DO LEVERAGE OUR INTERNAL METHODOLOGY OUR WEATHER FORECASTING CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO HELP. CONTINUE TO TARGET A AND BECOME MORE GRANULAR WORK CONTINUE TO ADVANCED OUT WORK SO GOOD AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE A THREE KILOMETER RESOLUTION FOR OUR SEVENTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILE SERVICE SERVICE TERRITORY WE'RE LOOKING TO GET TO ABOUT A TWO KILOMETER RESOLUTION THAT GIVES US AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY X. LEVEL OF GRANULARITY IN REGARDS TO GETTING AN UNDERSTANDING. OF WEATHER FORECASTING CAPABILITY AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF WEATHER STATIONS THAT WE'VE INSTALLED IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT REALLY GET US A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF PENETRATION. TO BE ABLE TO ENABLE. THAT CAPABILITY FROM A GRANT FROM A GRANULAR. FORECASTED PERSPECTIVE ABOUT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH TO YOUR POINT. B. REFERENCE YOU MADE REGARDING TO SOCIALIZATION THEY GO HAND IN HAND THE WEATHER STATIONS GIVE US THAT ADDITIONAL GRANULARITY FOR FORECASTING BUT WE ALSO NEED THE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY ON OUR ELECTRICAL GRID SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO SECTIONAL EYES OUR SYSTEM ITSELF SO WE PUT A PLAN TOGETHER TO AUTOMATE OR SOCIALIZE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT DEVICES ON OUR SYSTEM. OF INSTALLED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED- THIS YEAR ALONE AND IN THE NEXT SIX TO NINE MONTHS WE PLAN TO INSTALL THE ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWO HUNDRED SOCIALIZATION DEVICES THAT SHE- BENEFITS ABOUT HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND CUSTOMERS MEANING THAT IF WE HAVE A POTENTIAL PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OF AND WE CAN MAINTAIN SERVICE TO THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS OF ALL OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED SOCIALIZATION DEVICES ARE GOING TO BE IN PLAY. ADDING ANOTHER FIVE AND FIFTY DEVICES FOR THEIR- BENEFITS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS AND WE ACTUALLY SAW AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IN THE OCTOBER NINTH EVENT WHEN WE DID HAVE AN IMPACT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. OF THE TWO HUNDRED SOCIALIZATION DEVICES WE HAD IN PLACE WE WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THOSE AND WE WERE ABLE TO STILL MAINTAIN SERVICE TO ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS SO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY PART OF OUR STRATEGY AND WERE ACCELERATING AND MOVING TO ACTION ON THAT. ON OUR PLAN THE THIRD ITEM THAT I WOULD MENTION IS THAT SOCIALIZATION ONLY HELPS WHERE WE HAVE A SECONDARY SUPPLY TO AREA OUT THAT IS NOT. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE AT FIRE OR OR WHETHER RISK THE THIRD ELEMENT REALLY AT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS DISTRIBUTED GENERATION ENABLED MICRO GRATES AND MOVING TO ACTION ON THAT AND WE ACTUALLY EMPLOYED SOME OF THOSE CAPABILITIES IN THE MOST RECENT EVENTS AND THEY WERE USED IN THE FORM OF TEMPORARY GENERATION PRIMARILY PRIMARILY FOSSIL FUELS BUT GOING FORWARD WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPS ABSOLUTELY LEVERAGE CLEANER SOURCES. OF DISTRIBUTED GENERAL. IN THAT REGARD SO THOSE. THREE REALLY SPEAK. PS PS AN ADEQUATE FROM THIS YEAR TO NEXT YEAR. MR JOHNSON I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING THAT SENATOR BRADFORD MENTIONED IT'S RULE TWENTY EIGHT AND- THE UTILITIES PUT CREDIT SOCIETY BUILD RESERVES AND- ITS USE FOR BEAUTIFICATION BUT IT'S ALSO KIND OF BEEN LANGUISHING- AS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING AND WHY BRING IT UP BECAUSE P. JEANNIE HAS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SITTING. IN FUNDS AS OF DECEMBER THIRTY ONE FIFTEEN SO AS SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD A MAJOR CONFLAGRATION IS DISTRICT I'M LOOKING FOR AVAILABLE FUNDS IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WE SPEAK COLLECT ALL THIS MONEY JUST SIX AND SO IT'S LOW AGGRAVATING SO THAT'S WHY. I'M BRINGING IT UP WITH EACH OF THE. MAJOR WE USE- BECAUSE COMBINED YOU HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS SITTING IN BANK ACCOUNTS OR AS CREDITS THAT COULD BE USED IN SOME FORM OR FASHION EITHER FOR BEAUTIFICATION OR- TO HELP ASSIST AND MITIGATE IN CERTAIN CITIES AND COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S WHY. WE DID SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVEN SECURITY SEVEN. OKAY SENATE BILL FIVE EIGHTY FOUR EXCUSE ME- THIS YEAR TO TRY AND SAY HEY LET'S FROM REDIRECTED SO WE HAVE SOME AVAILABLE RESOURCES NOW TO ASSIST YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS IN TRYING TO. DEAL WITH THESE. WILDFIRE HIGH RISK ZONES SO I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION BUT I WILL ASK THE QUESTION THAT I ASKED THE LAST. PRISONER IN THAT IS. AS A FRANCHISEE AS A- FROM HIS CHARTERED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S TALK NOW ABOUT YOU KNOW REVOKING OR NATIONALIZING YOUR- COMPANY AND YOU ARE PUBLICLY TRADED AND YOU ARE. IN CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY SIGNAL MAYBE A LITTLE VULNERABLE SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT- WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON. SOME OF THESE. STATEMENTS OF. I WAS A LAWYER FOR MANY YEARS AND I GUESS I'M STILL LAWYER BUT I HAVEN'T HAD A LICENSE FOR TWENTY YEARS SO TAKE THIS FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH- AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE IN BANKRUPTCY WE HAVE ACTUALLY. THOUGHT ABOUT SOME OF THESE POTENTIAL SOLUTION. SO I THINK THE STATE HAS THE POWER THE CPU CITY TO REVOKE ARE FRENCH I BELIEVE THAT'S A LEGAL POSITION. I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A FAIRLY HIGH BURDEN THAT GOES WITH THAT. AS TO NATIONALIZING WHATEVER THE TERM IS ARE SOME BELIEVE IT'S THE FIFTH AMENDMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MET SO THAT WASN'T TAKING INVOLVED. SO THERE ARE NOT THIS COULD TURN OUT DIFFERENT WAYS. BUT WE DO HAVE A PLAN FOR THE BANKRUPTCY COURT TO. THE REST EMERGES P. JEANNIE WITH A DIFFERENT SORT OF VISION. BUT LARGE GONNA HAPPEN IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. THANK YOU MISTER IT'S AN OF I WILL TURN OVER TO A LAWYER THEN A SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU YOUR CHAIR AND- APPRECIATE YOUR TEAM BEING HERE TODAY. I WANT TO LEAD OFF SOMEBODY ALLUDED TO IT EARLIER. IN THE MIDST OF SOME OF THE POWER SHUTDOWNS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE REPORTS OF P. JEANNIE WORKERS BEING TARGETED. BY IRATE. CUSTOMERS AND RESIDENTS IN. TO THE EXTENT THERE IS ANYONE LISTENING TO THIS TODAY. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE TARGET I'VE SEEN THE COURAGEOUS WORK OF. WINE WORKERS NOT JUST P. JEANNIE BUT ALL THREE UTILITIES AND I THINK. I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ON THIS PANEL IN ACKNOWLEDGING. THE COURAGEOUS WORK IN THE OVERTIME WORK OF THOSE TRYING TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY. THAT SAID I DO WANT TO TURN TO SOME OF THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT P. JEANNIE- IS DOING IN HELL HELL YOU'VE MANAGED THE SHUTDOWNS. I THINK IT WAS SENATOR NIELSEN WHO RAISED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS- I REPRESENT A LOT OF RURAL AREAS IN THE CENTRAL COAST FROM SOME OF THE- ENTITIES IN THE CLEANEST ONLY. DIDN'T EVEN HAVE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS WHEN THEIR POWER WAS SHUT DOWN. HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHEN. WHERE AND HOW FREQUENTLY TO SET UP THESE RESOURCE CENTERS- AND HAVE YOU CONSIDERED CONTRACTING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO HAVE THE CAPACITY WHO COULD BE ENGAGED IN AN OUNCE TO USE THEIR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNITY CONTACTS. TO OPERATE ON THESE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS AND TO BE REIMBURSED BY P. JEANNIE FOR THAT SERVICE. SO I WILL TAKE THE SECOND PART AND THEN I'LL ASK LAURIE TO HELP WITH THE FIRST PART. OF WE HAVE WE ARE IS COMMISSION AT THE MOMENT OF CAN WE- CONTRACT HOW DO THIS DIFFERENTLY AS YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED WITH YOUR QUESTION. THAT WE WOULD REIMBURSE FOR THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS KIND OF THING AS THEIR MAIN. MAIN JOB AND SO WE ARE LOOKING ACTIVELY AT THAT POSITION SO AS TO HOW WE DETERMINE WHERE THE C. R. SHE'S ARE GOING HOME LAST GLORIA. EXPLAIN FOR YOUR QUESTION- DURING THE OCTOBER EVENTS WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTY- YES THE COUNTY OFFICIALS TO DETERMINE THE BEST LOCATIONS- TO PLACE THESE AND THEN HAD TO WORK WITH LANDOWNERS TO GET AGREEMENTS TO PUT THE AT THE C. R. C.'S ON THOSE LOCATIONS ULTIMATELY WE'D LIKE TO HAVE HARDENED FACILITIES THAT- WE MAY BRING IN BACK OF GENERATION FOR TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITIES ON AN ONGOING BASIS WE THINK SCHOOL ARE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO PARTNER WITH- IN YOUR DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY AND SPECIFICALLY IN SALINAS IN. WE HADN'T WE THOUGHT WE HAD AN AGREEMENT PROPERTY OWNER IN SALINAS AND IT FELT AT THE LAST MOMENT WE HAVE FOUR LOCATIONS- THE WE WENT TO THAT THE COUNTY HAD RECOMMENDED BUT CREE WITH YOU WE'RE GONNA BE TO MUCH MORE WORK WITH THE COUNTIES AND HAVING THEM HELP TO FIND WHERE BEST TO PLACE THESE RESOURCE CENTERS ENSURE THAT THEIR ADA COMPLIANT ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE AMPLE SUPPLIES REALLY ENSURE THAT WE ARE SUPPOSE THE COMMUNITIES IN THE WAY THAT THESE POLICE WE SHOULD SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY AND- THAT. WILL EXTEND BORDERS THE TYPE OF. THANK YOU I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU'RE LOOK AT. I KNOW AND JUST SALINAS BUT SOUTH COUNTY. GONZALEZ IN GREENFIELD WHICH ALSO HAVE HIGH MINORITY POPULATION LOW INCOME POPULATION AND I THINK THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT SOME OF THE RESOURCES WENT TO MORE AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES. I'M NOT SUGGEST THAT WAS YOUR INTENT BUT THAT'S THE PERCEPTION AND SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT IN PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE THEY'RE NOT BE A DISPARITY IN COMMUNITIES THAT RECEIVE THE EMERGENCY RESOURCES THAT ARE REQUIRED- I'D ALSO LIKE TO DO A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. ON YOUR COMMUNICATIONS HOW DO YOU WORK WITH TELECOM COMPANIES TO A LET THEM KNOW. THE AREAS ARE GONNA BE SHUT DOWN I HEARD FROM ONE OF THE LARGE TELECOM COMPANIES AGAIN IN MY AREA. THAT SOME THEY WEREN'T. TAXIDERMY PARTICIPATING IN ANY- EMERGENCY CENTER COMMUNICATIONS WITH. YOU SEE WITH P. JEANNIE WITH- YES AND THEY WERE LEARNING TRYING TO GO TO THE WEBSITE THAT HE CRASHED THEY WERE TRYING TO MOBILIZE GENERATORS. TWO TOWERS THEY KNOW WHERE TO TAKE THEM. WHEN COMMUNICATION DROPS IT DROPS TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AGAIN IN SOUTH MONTEREY COUNTY. UP IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS. THAT'S WHEN WE RUN THE RISK OF LOSS OF LIFE WHEN EMERGENCY RESPONDERS CAN BE CONTACTED IT WOULD SEEM A NUMBER ONE PUBLIC EMERGENCY. FOR P. JEANNIE WOULD BE. HAVE READY ONGOING COMMUNICATION WITH TELECOM OPERATORS IN COORDINATE NOT WHEN THE SHUTDOWN HAPPENS BUT IN ADVANCE STARTING TODAY LOOKING FORWARD THAT THE NEXT SHUTDOWN EVERYONE KNOWS HOW THEY COMMUNICATE WITH YOU HOW YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THEM. AND HOW THEY CAN DEPLOY GENERATORS TO MAINTAIN COMMUNICATIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT IT WE ALSO HARE THAT CONCERN AS AS WE LEVERAGE THE TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS FOR OUR- OUR WORKERS THAT- THAT YOU MENTIONED AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE OUT IN THE FIELD. WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH TELECOMMUNICATIONS- IT FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THEY ARE ASSIGNED ACCOUNTS SO THEY HAVE ACCOUNT MANAGERS THAT ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH THEM ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THE STATE OF WITH YOUR CALLAWAY YES- TO COORDINATE WITH THOSE- BUT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES SO OUR IT'S OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM- WE HAVE ONE POSITION AND THAT IS IN OUR OUR INTO THE COMMAND STRUCTURE THAT SITS IN THE CUSTOMER BRANCH TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THAT IS WORKING WITH CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE CONSIDER THE TOP. OF THAT SO WHAT BUT WE'RE GOING TO ASIAN WITH THEM AT MULTIPLE LEVELS- IN ORGANIZATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THEM ENSURE THAT THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS SURE OF IT ON THE NETWORKS REMAIN UP AND OPERATIONAL FOR CUSTOMER. THANK YOU. IN I THINK MISTER JOHNSON MAYBE BACK TO YOU IF YOU WANTED TO FOR THE QUESTION BUT- ESTIMATES OF. THE LIABILITIES OF P. JEANNIE FROM THE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN FIRE TRAGEDIES ARM WE READ ESTIMATES OF THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS OF LIABILITY. IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE. RESISTANCE TO UNDERGROUND WIRES EIGHT THE RULE OF THUMB IS TO BE A MILLION DOLLARS A MILE I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY HIGHER THAN THAT NOW. IF YOU TAKE SEVENTY THOUSAND MILES OF YOUR SERVICE WHERE'S THAT YOU ALLUDED TO. IN YEAR OPENING STATEMENT. IF YOU UNDER GROUNDED ONE QUARTER OF THOSE. AND A MILLION DOLLAR SMILE IN THE HIGHEST RISK FIRE AREAS MY MATH SAYS THAT WOULD BE ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION. SO THE THIRTY BILLION OF LIABILITY YOU FACE NOW TO SAVE MONEY FOR SHAREHOLDERS. IF HALF THAT HAD BEEN INVESTED IN UNDER GROUNDING IN HIGH RISK AREAS YOU MIGHT HAVE LIMITED P. GENIES LEADERSHIP MIGHT HAVE LIMITED. THE CURRENT LIABILITY IT'S LOOKING AT NOW SO. AS WE MOVE FORWARD ARE BEGINNING CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT UNDER GROUNDING IS TOO EXPENSIVE OR WHAT TIPPING POINT DO DETERMINE THAT YES EXPENSIVE. BUT IN THE LONG RUN IT'S THE RIGHT AND MEANT TO MAKE TO PROTECT AGAINST WHAT JERRY BROWN CALLED THE NEW ABNORMAL. OF CLIMATE CHANGE NEXUS. TIRE FIRE. UNPRECEDENTED WINDOW VENTS AND THE NEXUS WITH ELECTRIC POWER LINES. SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE THIS UNDER GROUNDING CONSIDERABLY MORE OF OUR SYSTEM. NOT BECAUSE OF THE LIABILITY SO MUCH IS YOUR SINCE THE RIGHT THING TO DO GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY'RE A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT OUR SYSTEM THAT ARE UNIQUE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SIXTY AND SEVENTY KV TRANSMISSION. AND A LOT OF LARGE TRANSMISSION THAT YOU CANNOT REALLY PUT UNDERGROUND. SO THIS IS REALLY LIMITED TO DISTRIBUTION. AND THEN THE EQUATION WILL BE IS A BETTER UNDERGROUND IS A BETTER TO PUT COVERED HARDEN WIRE UP ALL THESE KIND OF THINGS BUT ALL OF HIS ACTIVITY WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD REDUCING THE RISK. IT WOULD SEEM IN THE LONG TERM FOR YOUR SHAREHOLDERS INVESTING IN REDUCTION OF RISK. WOULD BE IN YOUR SHAREHOLDERS INTEREST AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC SAFETY. I AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER MINING SITTING SENATOR MCGUIRE. I THINK SO MUCH STRUCTURE REGRETFUL SIR- ONE I JUST SAY IF YOU THINK HE'S BEFORE I GET INTO SOME COMMENTS RESEARCHERS WELL SOME QUESTIONS AND I'LL- IN WITH SOME VERY QUICK COMMENTS AS WELL. WHEN I SAY THANK YOU MISTER SAYING FOR TAKING TIME AFTER THE PREVIOUS MEAN PEOPLE GO THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES I WANT TO POINT OUT TO MISTER PATTERSON WHO'S HERE TODAY- IT FOR HIS. EFFORTS WORKING ON GETTING TIMELY INFORMATION NOW- AS WELL AS MISTER HADLEY WHO IS AN EMBEDDED WITHIN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER ON THE NORTH COAST. A SIXTEEN BE ABLE TO GET S. SCHOOLS IN CRITICAL FACILITY UP ON ME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I ALSO WANT TO KNOW IS IT TOO JOHNSON IS BEEN HERE AT POLICE AS APRIL- AND YOU HAVE INHERITED BUT A HOT MESS SIR- AND- WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THIS. WE CAN THROW OUT ALL THE NUMBERS WE WANT THE THIRTY BILLION OR THE TWO BILLION. BUT IT DOESN'T PUT IN CONTEXT TRULY WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OF THE LINES ARE OVER THE GREED IS. SO THE TRUTH IS THERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY WE'RE HERE. THE TRUTH IS THERE HAS BEEN HISTORIC LACK INVESTMENT BY PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY BUT WITHIN A TRICKLE CREEK. I IN THERE HAS BEEN SOME MISMANAGEMENT HUNTER PERSON. YOU ARE BEHIND IN MODERNIZATION. YOUR BEHIND GREAT HARDENING IN YOUR BEHIND IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. AND IN FACT THE ONLY TIME THAT I'VE HEARD IN MY FIVE YEARS SINCE LEGISLATURE AT THIS CORPORATION IS PRECEDED YOUR TIME SIR SO I TOTALLY GET THAT TALKING ABOUT TARGETING SHUT OFFS. TWO POINT CAMERAS. AND MAKING SURE THAT- THERE IS INVESTMENT IN THE SYSTEM IS ONLY AFTER THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES SO WE'RE TAKING A POSITION TO BE IN REACTIVE RATHER BEING PROACTIVE. AND THE STATE DOES OWN SOME SKIN IN THIS GAME THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS NOT HELD THE CORPORATION ACCOUNTABLE IN FORESEEN WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED MANY YEARS AGO. ANY ALSO AVENUE CLIENT ID THAT IS CUT UP TO YOU BECAUSE P. JEANNIE HAS NOT INVESTED AS YOU SHOULD HAVE AS OTHER NEIGHBORING UTILITIES HAVE INGRID MODERNIZATION. HARDEN AND IN FACT IN APPRECIATE MISSING I THINK YOU'VE BEEN IN THE COMPANY FOR TWO YEARS. SUMMARY IN THERE THIS POSITION FOR YOUR SIDE OKAY THIS IS A THREE YEAR. APPRECIATE ALL THIS WORK IS GOING INTO NOW BUT IT'S IN REACTION TO ALL THE FIRES IN THE DISASTERS THAT HAVE COST CALIFORNIANS LIVES. IN IS COST THEM THEIR LIVELIHOODS. TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WOULD LIKE TO BE TO TALK- JUST BE A COVER HERE IN AND LIKE TO BE A WRAP UP IT'LL BE QUICK. MISTER VICE CHAIR. TO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES BECAUSE WHAT I'VE HEARD THIS IS MISSING AND I HAD A CONVERSATION- THE DATA DOESN'T PLAY OUT. ESPECIALLY IN MENDOCINO COUNTY OR CINEMA COUNTY LAKE COUNTY WHERE WE'VE SEEN SO THE MOST CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. THE DATA DOESN'T PLAY OUT- IN REGARD TO BEING DEPLOYING THE MODERNIZATION AS YOU STATES HAVE. AND IN FACT YOUR REPRESENTATIVES IN MISSING I'M NOT GONNA KICK THE DEAD DOG UNDERNEATH HIS TABLE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THIS- YOU HAVE REPRESENTATIVES THAT GO TO THE MINUTES YOU KNOW COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THERE IS A WILDFIRE NOT COUNTY. THE COST LIVES. LET ALONE YOU KNOW HOW MANY CAMERAS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED. OR HOW MANY MILES OF LINE. HAS CRITICAL MILES A LINE EXIST. I UNDERSTAND MR SAYING IT'S BEEN WORKING WITH THE TEAM ON THAT. I BRING ALL THIS UP IS SO TEN YEARS YOU SAY IT'S GONNA TAKE TEN YEARS IS THAT SATISFACTORY TO YOU. TO BE A MODERNIZE. OF NOTE IN THE ME FIRST CLARIFY WHAT IT IS I ACTUALLY SO. WHICH WAS A TEN YEAR PERIOD CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF SDG AN EDISON TO GET TO A POINT WHERE THESE ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT OR CERTAINLY SURGICAL- NO IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME TO HAVE ANOTHER YEAR LIKE THIS ONE. BUT LONG KENNEDY'S TO WHAT IS THAT-MEAN FOR US WHO WERE SO IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS- AT OF THIRTY DAYS WE HAD FOR POWER OUTAGE. YOU SAY THAT. IN THE SYSTEM THERE IS NO MORE THAN FIVE DAYS YOU HAVE LOCAL OFFICIALS WERE HERE TODAY THAT WERE OUT FOR SIX OR SEVEN. SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT INCONSISTENT COMES FROM BUT JUST BEING HONEST ABOUT IT- THIS IS TYPICAL FOR P. JEANNIE. THEY SAY ONE THNG AND REALLY THE REALITIES DIFFERENT. THERE ARE SOME ISOLATED COMMITTEES ARE OUT FOR ELEVEN. ELEVEN DAYS. SO I ASK YOU. WHAT WOULD BE A TIME LINE THAT WOULD BE SATISFACTORY IF IT'S NOT TEN. WELL I THINK TEN IS A GOOD ONE STILL FOR VERY TARGETED LIMITED SMALL NUMBERS IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE GREAT PROGRESS IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS. AND SO MAYBE WE CAN TO FIVE TO GET TO A REALLY GOOD PLACE. BUT THE NEXT COUPLE OF THREE YEARS OLD THE CRUCIAL IN MY OPINION. I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE THAT ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT I THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION- NEED TO BRING FORTIES WE NEED A PERFORMANCE BASED- METRICS THAT ARE BUILT INTO LAW IF WE DO NOT HAVE THOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS BUILT INTO LAW. WE'RE GONNA BE SITTING HERE FIVE YEARS LATER HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION THAT'S WHAT I'M DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT. BUT I DID TALK ABOUT ANOTHER ISSUE. TRANSMISSION LINES WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPRECIATE THE PHONE CALL IN REGARDS TO THE CAN KATE FIVE. THE TRANSPORTATION LANES. UP IN THE MAYACAMAS NEAR THE GEYSERS WEREN'T SHUT DOWN. SO WE HAD THE POWERSHOT OFFICE AND WE HAD A SECONDARY EMERGENCY- WHERE THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS CHALLENGE I WILL USE IN NON TECHNICAL TERM OF SOME TYPE OF SPARK. THAT BECAUSE THE FIRE TO START. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION SO I'M NOT GOING TO GOING TO THAT BUT I'D LIKE TO BE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR THRESHOLDS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU DO NOT SHUT DOWN THE SET SIZE TRANSMISSION LINES UNLESS THERE'S GOING TO BE SUSTAINED. FIFTY FIVE MILE PER HOUR WINDS. GUSTS STAY HERE OKAY SINGLE S. MY ISSUE WAS WITH THAT IS THAT CAL FIRE FORECASTS FOR THE MY COMMON THAT NIGHT. IN OTHER LOCAL FORECAST SHOWED THAT IN GAPS WE'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR. IN FACT IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT- IN THE NORTH BAY WAS AT A HUNDRED AND TWO MILES PER HOUR AT THAT THE STRONG AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT MOUNT ST LENA WE LOOK AT THE MY COMMON MOUNTAINS. THERE ARE SUSTAIN GASES SEMINARY SEVENTY OR EIGHTY MILES PER HOUR. SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE SHUTTING DOWN. ONE IN THE VALLEY. YET WHERE WE LOOK AT THESE FIRE STARTER HAPPENING UP IN THE MOUNTAINS WHY WEREN'T THOSE TRANSMISSION LINES TURN DOWN WE KNEW THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE FORECAST THAT SETS A STAIN WIND OF OVER FIFTY FIVE. THAT'S A QUESTION. SECOND I CAN CHIME CHIME IN ON THE CENTER REQUIRE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO THE FIFTY FIVE MILE AN HOUR REFERENCE- IS NOT A BLANKET. FOR EVERY SINGLE TRANSMISSION LINE WE EVALUATE- EVERY SINGLE TRANSMISSION LINE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS THAT APPROPRIATE THRESHOLD BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON. THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE LINE IF IT'S ON A RIDGE LINE IF IT'S IN A WIN CORRIDOR. AND WE ALSO LOOK AT THE- POTENTIAL. FOR FIRE SPREAD THE ASSOCIATE CONSEQUENCE AND ALSO THE IMPACT OF FROM A GRADE STABILITY PERCENT THEY HAVE BEEN THAT THIS WAS A HIGHER VOLTAGE- TO THIRTY KV LINE- THE FORECAST THAT WE HAD- PUT TOGETHER FROM A INTERNAL MAYBE ALL YOU PERSPECTIVE- DID NOT- NECESSARILY GET UP TO. YOU KNOW THAT THRESHOLD. WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN FIFTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR FOR THIS SPECIFIC LINE TO MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR DIGITIZATION. I AM PERPLEXED AND I'M NOT IN ENERGY EXPERT WHATSOEVER. BUT HERE'S WHAT I'LL SAY. YEAH SHUT DOWN. MY ARM ONE POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE TO PEAK SOMEWHERE AROUND IN THERE GIVE OR TAKE. IF YOU LEAVE THESE TRANSMISSION LINES VETERAN FIRE CRITICAL ZONES. UP AND RUNNING AND IN FACT IN YEARS PAST YOU HAD SIGNIFICANT FIRE STARTS IN THAT SAME AREA. SO YOU KEEP THESE TRANSMISSION LINES OPEN. THERE IS A CATASTROPHIC EVENT ON ONE OF THE LINES INVESTIGATION IS STILL PENDING. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE LARGEST WHILE IN FOREIGN CINEMA COUNTY HISTORY BURNING DOWN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE HOMES INVESTIGATION SO PENDING. I DO SAY I QUESTION A QUESTION INCONSISTENCY OF YOU TELL EVERYONE AND THEIR BROTHER. THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS FIRE SAFETY. AND THEN YOU KEEP THE DAM TRANSMISSION LINES IN THE MOST FIRE CRITICAL TERRY TERRITORY OPEN AND LIFE. GIVE ME THE UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT WORKS AND WHY THAT WOULD BE WHY THAT DECISION WILL BE MADE WE ACTUALLY DID SHUT DOWN SEVERAL TRANSMISSION LINES OBVIOUSLY HE DIDN'T SHUT DOWN THE ONE THAT HAD THE SPARK SO THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO GET TO SO- IN I PROMISE TO MOVE ON AFTER THIS IN JUST FINISH UP BUT- SO PLEASE- S. AS BILL OF MISTER JOHNSON MENTIONED IN REGARDS TO SOME OF OUR SUB TRANSMISSION LINES OF SIXTY SEVENTY KV- TO SOME OF OUR LARGER- IN HIGHER VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION LINES SO WE DID SHUT DOWN. MANY TRANSMISSION LINES OF SIXTY SEVENTY HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN KV- WITHIN THOSE RESPECTIVE FOOTPRINTS AS PART OF THE OCTOBER TWENTY THIRD EVENT AND I THINK AS YOU STATED OF THE CALIFORNIA'S TO CREATIONIST ALONG GOING AND WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT. THE ACTUAL DESIGN AND THE CONSTRUCTION. IN THAT LINE WAS ACTUALLY BUILT IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES IT WAS INSPECTED FROM A CLIMBING INSPECTION RECENTLY IT WAS INSPECTED WITHIN THE LAST SIX MONTHS WAS INSPECTED FROM A DRONE INSPECTION THAT IS CORRECT SIR- SO GIVEN THE INSPECTION. INFORMATION FROM A CONDITION STANDPOINT AS WELL AS THE DESIGN ON THE CONSTRUCTION ON THE FORECASTED WIND SPEED FOR THIS SPECIFIC LINE AND SOME OF THE FIVE HUNDRED KV LINES IN THAT SPECIFIC WIND OF AND- IT DID NOT MEET THE THRESHOLD BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF TRANSMISSION LINES THAT DIDN'T MEET THAT THRESHOLD THAT WE DID DE ENERGIZE. OUR MOVE ON FROM THAT ALL THIS IN WITH THIS IS THAT. WHEN YOU ARE EXPECTING HURRICANE FORCE WINDS IN THAT AREA. WHERE YOU HAVE HAD PREVIOUS CATASTROPHIC FIRE STARTS. NOT BE AN ENERGY EXPERT CAN YOU TURN OFF THE POWER TO ONE POINT SIX NINE FOLKS WHY YOU WOULDN'T TURN EVERYTHING OUT. LACKS A MOVE ON. WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO TALK ABOUT. YOUR GAME PLAN FOR THE MOST NEEDY FOLKS AND AS YOU MAY PREPARE TO TURN OUT THE LIGHTS AGAIN THIS WEEK WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT SENIORS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT A COLDER OF IN. AVERAGE HEIGHT ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN AT LEAST IN CINEMA COUNTY. AND A LOW OF THIRTY FIVE SELECT TO HEAR WHAT THAT GAME PLAN IS FOR THIS WEEK SINCE YOU'RE COORDINATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES I'D LIKE TO ASK THE DIRECTOR WHEN HE COMES UP ABOUT THAT. IT WAS LOCAL% JURISDICTIONS WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE AS FAR AS ARE YOU CAN GO WITH THE TYPICAL RESOURCE CENTERS. TELL US WHAT TO EXPECT. THE STORE WITH LORI AND THEN WILL BEGIN ON THE TABLE. SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTY ON BEST ON HOW BEST TO SUPPORT CUSTOMERS- IN THE AREA WE'VE BEEN CORNING VERY CLOSELY WITH- HOW WE SUPPORT- CERTAINLY THE ELDERLY F. AND CUSTOMERS ARE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS- WE ARE ENACTING A RESOURCE CENTER STRATEGIES SOME WILL BE HARDENED SITES THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE IDENTIFIED OTHERS WILL BE- THE OTHER SITES THEY WILL HAVE HEATING THEY WILL HAVE COOLING- THEY WILL BE OPEN FROM EIGHT TO EIGHT. TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS WILL BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE- CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS TO SUPPORT OUR AFN CUSTOMERS AND WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY- AGENCIES AS WELL AS- OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. HE JUST. THE SHERIN THIS SO IF THERE WAS A SIMILAR VEIN. WHETHER IT IS A WHILE IN FIRE EARTHQUAKE. OR A SUSTAIN FORTY EIGHT HOUR TO SEVENTY TWO HOUR POWER OUTAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING. CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN RED CROSS OR HOSTING THEIR OWN EMERGENCY EVACUATION CENTER. THEY NEED DOESN'T STOP AFTER EIGHT PM. SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE BONE CHILLING TEMPERATURES. IN OUR FORTY EIGHT SEVEN TWO HOURS AHEAD OF THIS NEXT EVENT. AND AGAIN NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE DISRESPECTFUL I HEARD ABOUT A THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT TALK SO ARE YOU PLANNING ON HEATING CENTERS ARE THEY GOING TO BE OPEN PASS EIGHT PM AND WHAT DO YOU CAN DO FOR THE MOST MEDICALLY FRAGILE BECAUSE WE SWEET FACE THIS. YA KNOW- IN THIS LAST EVENT WHAT WE SAW LOWER TEMPERATURES SO WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH THECOUNTIES AND WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THAT WORK WITH THEM TO DETERMINE- WHERE WE KNOW THE REQUEST IS OUT THERE TO HAVE SHELTERS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE RED CROSS. THEY RESPOND WHEN THERE IS A CATASTROPHIC EMERGENCY THEY DON'T RESPOND IN ADVANCE OF THAT COULD COMPENSATE THEM TO DO SO WE- THEY'RE NOT THEY'VE NOT BEEN OPEN TO THIS POINT TO DOING THAT WITH US- WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AND WORK WITH. OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THE LAW AND- HAD EXTENDED OUTAGES IT. TWO ON TWENTY SEVEN THE COUNTY WANTED TO RUN A SHELTER WE HELP SUPPORT THAT IN THE COUNTY SO AS WE GET REQUESTED BY THE COUNTIES WILL WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM TO KEEP GENERATION KEEP HEAT- KEEP SUPPLIES- WE PROVIDED BLANKETS TO THE COUNTIES- AND HOT COLD PERISHABLE FOODS- FOR THE COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF OUR VULNERABLE TRIMMERS I THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME FOLLOW UP ON THIS AS WE MOVE FORTY FOR KENNEDY'S HAVE ALLERGIES. ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF THE NEXT BUT FOR CENTER NIELSEN SAID IN A COOLER TEMPERATURES THEY'RE HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT THANK YOU- SAID IT'S IN A PROCEDURE. OF THE WRAPPING UP HERE MOMENTARILY ON THIS. ONLINE THAT YOU ARE MOST WORRIED ABOUT WOULD THAT BE CORRECT THAT'S PART OF OUR SYSTEM HARDENING SCOPE CORRECT IN THE ELEVATOR AND EXTREME FAR RISK AREA. SO JUST SO I GET A BETTER SCENE SO. IN THE BEGINNING TEN YEARS. MR JOHNSON YOU BELIEVE THAT COULD BE DONE FOR MISSING YOU BELIEVE THAT CAN BE DONE AND HOW MANY YEARS ESPECIALLY THAT SEVEN THOUSAND MILES MOST FIRE CRITICAL LINE WHERE YOU HAVE THE MOST ON ABILITY AND WE'RE SEEING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POWER SHUT US. SO I THE SYSTEM HARDING PLAN- IS STILL WITHIN THAT TEN YEAR TIME PERIOD BECAUSE THAT INCLUDES- REBUILDING THE OVERHEAD SYSTEM AS WELL AS UNDER GROUNDING AND WRITE DOWN A FINE OPPORTUNITIES. TO CONTINUE- TO COMPRESS. THAT TIME FRAME NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT DOESN'T THE ONLY PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE FROM RISK REDUCTION IN PERSPECTIVE WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR. A RISK INFORMED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT GOES WELL BEYOND THE TWENTY REQUIREMENTS TO REMOVE ALL THE OVERHANG AS WELL AS POTENTIAL. THAT RESTRICT THAT COULD BE. A HIGHER PRONE TO BEND HIGHER SUSCEPTIBLE TO COME IN CONTACT WITH OUR LINES AND THAT'S ALSO A- MULTI YEAR PROGRAM BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING- IN THE SHORT TERM. IN REGARDS TO REAL TIME MONITORING INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES FIRE DETECTION CAPABILITIES. WHAT I SPOKE OF IN TERMS OF REDUCING. THE IMPACT OF PS KOPEN. PLEASE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BETEN YEARS. SO IS THERE ANY FIVE IS IN A BE FORCED ON THE SIX I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT NOW. HOW MUCH MORE QUICKLY CAN WE DO THIS TO WHAT WHAT IS IN IN- AS YOU CAN TELL.ONE AND WE GET A LOOK AT SPECIFICS BECAUSE- MR ASKING. SO WHEN COULD WE EXPECT A REVISED EXPEDITED TIMELINE. WHO HAVE TO FILE AN UPDATED. PLAN WITH THE COMMISSION IN JANUARY IT'S EARLY PART OF NEXT YEAR THE EXACT TIMING IS- STILL TBD. YOU WILL SEE THE DETAILS. LAST QUESTION IN CLOSING COMMENTS. IN PERSON FOR LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES. LOCAL FIRE LOCAL POLICE SHARE SOFFICI AMBULANCE PROVIDERS. THEY HAVE NOW BECOME THE IMPROMPTU P. JEANNIE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY. AND THEY'RE RESPONDING OUT WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT. AND THEY'RE RESPONDING TO A SURGEON CALLS AND I'LL GO TO LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BY LAKE COUNTY MENDOCINO COUNTY A SURGEON CALLS. FOR THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE A SURGEON PATIENT LOADS TO LOCAL HOSPITALS OF SENIORS AND- HOW GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS IN REGARD TO REIMBURSE SEEN. OUT LOCAL EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES PUBLIC AGENCIES OUT DURING PUBLIC SHOT OFFICE WHAT WOULD YOUR THOUGHT BEYOND THAT. WELL ACROSS HE SAID I HAVEN'T GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT TO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE STILL YOU KNOW AT ONE MORE CUED UP AND WE'VE BEEN. BURIED IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS. HI I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT I WOULDN'T HAZARD UNANSWERED RUBBING GLAD TO THINK ABOUT AND GET BACK TO YOU. A CLOSER HERE. MISTER CHAIR AND YOU SAY THIS. AND I'M READING THESE YES FROM THE COUNTIES THAT IN SUBMITTED. THERE HAS TO BE A FOCUS AND COMMUNICATION YOUR COMMUNICATION FROM THE TOP. DOES NOT GET DOWN TO THE GROUND LEVEL THE COMMUNICATION IS NOT BEEN CONSISTENT. WANTED TO ADDRESS MR SAYING THE PREVIOUS HEARING. THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TOLD THEY WOULD BE OFF. AND IN A STATE ON. AND THE VICE VERSA SOMEWHERE SAID SOMEWHERE TOTALLY BE A ON THEN THEY WERE TURNED OFF. I CONTINUES TO HAPPEN. EVEN THOUGH WITHOUT THOSE CAN IN LAST YEAR. THE AREAS OF IMPACT THAT Y'ALL SAY ARE GOING TO BE TURNED OFF ITS CONVOLUTED AND IT'S CONFUSING. EVEN IN THE WEBSITE- BUT THAT HAS TO BE THE LOWEST OF LOW HANGING FRUIT. P. JEANNIE TOLD MENDOCINO COUNTY OFFICIALS THAT POWERED RESUME ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIFTH AND IT DID NOT HE THEN TOLD THEM THEY WOULD BE RESUMED ON OCTOBER TWENTY NINTH AND IT DID NOT HAPPEN. THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY. OF TELLING LOCAL OFFICIALS WHEN THE POWERS CAN BE COMING BACK ON. YOU MENTION ISSUE OF CHARGING STATION SAVINGS FOR ATTIC IN THE LEVEL SERVICE. I HAVE A PICTURE OF A CHARGING STATION THAT WAS IN ARCADIA THAT EIGHTY SIX FOOT COSCO TABLE TWO CHAIRS AND NOTHING ELSE. I DON'T KNOW WHO IS DOING QUALITY CONTROL ON THE P. JEANNIE TEAM. BUT THEY NEED TO BE BEEFED UP. AND AGAIN I'LL SAY THIS AGAIN I KNOW MISTER JOHNSON HAS BEEN HERE SINCE APRIL. BUT ULTIMATELY THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU SIR. AND WHAT I THINK YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONVINCE YOUR CUSTOMERS UP IS THAT. YOU'RE NOT ON STRIKE THREE. BECAUSE PRIOR TO YOUR TEN YEAR THAT STRIKE ONE WAS SAN BRUNO. AND THE COVER UP. STRIKE TWO WITH TWO SEVEN EIGHT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THEN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES. AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING YOUR CUSTOMERS BETTER TRUST YOU AGAIN ASKED AFTER THE DEBACLE THESE POWER OUTAGES. AND KEEP TRUSTS AND IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER. WE'RE NOW IN YOUR TO. SO WHAT I WOULD ASK IS. ARE YOU MY LAST QUESTION ARE YOU OPEN TO ALL OPTIONS. BOB P. JEANNIE LOOKING DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE. A PUBLIC OPTION ARE YOU OPEN TO LOOKING INTO REGIONAL OPTION. AND ALL ENDED RIGHT THERE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR INDULGENCE FOR FUTURE. WOULD YOU LIKE A RESPONSE TO THAT YEAH NO ABSOLUTELY PLEASE AND OF YOUR ENDING. SO. I'M OPEN TO ANY RESPONSE THAT SERVES THE NEEDS BEST OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. NOW I DO WORK FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS AT THE MOMENT SO LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES ABOUT THAT. I ACTUALLY THINK CAN KEEPING PIGEON A IS AN INTEGRATED. DIFFERENT COMPANY IS THE BEST WAY TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION. BUT YOU KNOW WE ARE A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING HAND- PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS A COMPLETED IN THERE AND SEE HOW THAT WORKS. I CAME HERE NO REALLY TO BE HELPFUL AND I WANT THE BEST OUTCOME FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. TO BE DETERMINED THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU YOU KNOW- MISTER JOHNSON- I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED BY YOUR A DIRECT TALK YOU'VE BEEN IN MY OFFICE COUPLE TIMES I'VE SEEN YOU QUOTED IN THE IN THE PAPERS WITH THAT STRAIGHT TALK. YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING MY JOB IF I DIDN'T HAVE SOME STRAIGHT TALK WITH YOU TODAY. AND I'LL TELL YA NOT WITHSTANDING THE TRANSMISSION LINES- ISSUE THAT THE SENATE MCGUIRE JUST BROUGHT UP. YOU I LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER NINTH. AS A BIG SCREW YOU. DEAR CUSTOMERS TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO THE GOVERNOR AND I THINK A TERM THAT YOU PROBABLY USE IN TENNESSEE WAS YELLED THAT DOG DON'T HUNT. AND I REALLY BELIEVE- THAT THAT HAS REALLY CREATED AMONGST THE LEGISLATURE. AMONGST YOUR CUSTOMERS A REAL TRUST ISSUE THAT WHEN YOU DO DO A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD JOB LATER ON AFTER OCTOBER TWENTY THIRD IT LEAVES EVERYBODY WONDERING. WHAT ARE WE GONNA HAVE NEXT ARE THEY GOING TO BE DOING THIS TO- YOU KNOW IT IN IN THAT ON THAT FIRST ONE I JUST FELT LIKE YOU KNOW THIRTY COUNTIES. AND YOU KNOW WE WERE MONTEREY PRETTY CLOSELY IN THE NAPA VALLEY IN THE SNOW MY COUNTY LAKE COUNTY AND THE WIND SPEEDS YEAH THE WE HAD ALL THROUGHOUT OUR AREA AND PROBLEMS MISTER SAYING THIS. YOU KNOW THIS GOES TO YOU. SORRY. YEAH THERE WAS NO WIND. LITTLE OR NO WITH ME UNTIL MAYBE THE THIRD DAY THAT FRIDAY AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE HAD IT SHUT OFF ON WEDNESDAY ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS YEAR YOU'RE BEHIND SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC BEHIND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IN TERMS OF THESE POWERSHOT OFFICE I GET THAT BUT- YOU KNOW TO ME I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC. IN PULLING THE PLUG WHEN THE WINDS ARE EVEN AT THE LEVEL WHERE STATUTORILY. YOU HAVE TO. I MEAN I UNDERSTAND BEFORE THE WINDS GET TO FIFTY MILES AN HOUR FIFTY FIVE WHATEVER THE STATUTORY- THE- WIND SPEEDS ARE THE YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR LINES STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND. BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK NO WINTER FIVE MILES AN HOUR EVEN TEN MILE AN HOUR WINDS- YOU KNOW IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU YOU JUST CONTINUE TO LOSE. THE OTHER TRUSTS I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT THE GREAT IS NOT CONNECTED BUT- YOU KNOW IN IN IN A COMMUNITY WHERE YOU HAVE A MILE AWAY. A WHOLE COMMUNITY THAT'S. OFFERING AND REALLY ECONOMY IS WORKING AT THEN A MILE TO THE NORTH IN A MILE TO THE SOUTH EVERYBODY'S OFF IN OTHER COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMIES ARE SUFFERING BEYOND BELIEF IT REQUIRES- YOU AGAIN THAT QUESTIONING WHO IN THE HELL DESIGNED YOUR SYSTEM. SO I KNOW THIS IS THE INNER I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE GONNA SAY IDEA AFTER THIS BECAUSE I REALLY NOT ASKING IT ANY DIRECT QUESTIONS BUT IT YOU CAN SENSE THE FRUSTRATION THAT WE HAVE DEALING WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND IF YOU WANT TO CALL ME HERE WELCOME AND THEY'RE ALL ASKS ME TO EXPLAIN HOW HE DESIGNED ASSIST. IN THE YEARS OF THE PREVIOUS ONES. ON THE FIRST POINT- HI I'VE HEARD THIS COMMENT THAT. WE DID THIS EVENT TO SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT INVERSE OR YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING. I CAN ASSURE YOU WE WERE NOT. THAT WE WERE FOLLOWING THE PROTOCOL WE HAVE ON FILE- DID WHETHER TURN OUT EXACTLY LIKE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD NO. BUT THERE WAS NO MESSAGE THERE OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN WERE FOLLOWING THE PROTOCOL AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE A NEW TO SAY ABOUT THAT EVENT. HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT AN EVENT BUT TO YOUR QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM CENTER OBVIOUSLY THIS IS- THE DATES A LOT OF US HERE AS WELL RIGHT SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT- WAS INHERITED AS PART OF A- THE INTEGRATION OF MULTIPLE. IN A UTILITIES AND WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT WHAT'S DIFFERENT BETWEEN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. WE DO SEE A LOT OF LONG RADIO LINES THAT DO SERVE OF LOW DENSITY NON URBAN CUSTOMER MAKES IT WAS INTERESTING IS WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THE RATIO. OF NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS EVEN THOUGH THE LARGEST TIRE YOU WITHIN THE STATE- WE HAVE THE LOWEST CUSTOMER DOWN. FOR DISTRICT DISTRIBUTION LIFESTYLE WELL AS A LOS CUSTOMER DENSITY PER TRANSMISSION LINES BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF LONG RADIO LINES. THAT ARE TRAVERSING NOW THE HIGH FAR REST BRISK AREAS THAT ARE PROVIDING SERVICE- TO SOME LARGE COMMUNITIES AND WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IS. AS. PREVENT SEGMENTING IN AND- FOCUSING ON DE ENERGIZING THE- TO LINE THAT'S TRAVERSING THE HIGH FAR RISK AREA. THERE'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE A SECONDARY SUPPLY. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I AS SPEAKING TO IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING THIS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR. IS IDENTIFYING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISTRIBUTED ENABLED. GENERATION MICRA QUITS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT POTENTIAL SECONDARY SUPPLY IN SOME CASES- WE DON'T HAVE A BACK FEET WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY- CONNECTED FROM ANOTHER CIRCUIT THAT MAY BE IN A LOWER FIRE RISK AREA. AND FOR THEIR SEGMENT THE CIRCUIT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON FROM A AT RISK PERSPECTIVE. AND WHAT REALLY TRANSPIRED ON THE OCTOBER NINTH OF AND. EVEN THE SCALE OF THE EVENT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS WAS THE LARGEST- SHUT OFF EVENT THAT WAS DONE ON THE HISTORY OF P. JEANNIE. AS WE STARTED TO LOOK AT THE TRANSMISSION LINES THAT WERE INVOLVED. IN THE SHUT OFF AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE INTERCONNECTED NATURE OF THAT GREAT IT ENDED UP HAVING A UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF LOSING SOME CUSTOMERS EARLIER ON- IN A BAND THE AT RISK WHETHER- REALLY- REQUIRED AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON. TO BE VERY SURGICAL ABOUT SO THAT WE CAN MITIGATE THOSE TYPES ISSUES BECAUSE THE POINTS YOU WERE MAKING. WERE COMPLETELY ALIGNED ON TO BE ABLE TO- MINIMIZE THE IMPACT TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR MODERATION PERSPECTIVE. AND THAT'S TWO FOLD ONE IS TO BE ABLE TO- DE ENERGIZED AS CLOSE TO THE AT RISK WEATHER EVENT AT AND STARTING ABOUT AT RISK WEATHER EVENT AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN SECONDARILY AS THAT EVENT SIR PASSED IS THE SERVICE TERRITORY. IS TO BE ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT RATIO IN VERY VERY QUICKLY AND- THAT WE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE DâN. FROM LAST YEAR I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS OVER INVOLVED IN THE OCTOBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN EVENT. AND IT TOOK US NEARLY FIFTY ONE HOURS. RESTORATION TIME WHICH MEANS AFTER THE AT RISK WHETHER SUBSIDE. COMPARE THAT TO THE OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH OF AND WE HAD NINE HUNDRED AND ACCOUNTS WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT RESTORATION ON AVERAGE IN TWELVE HOURS SO A SIGNIFICANT IN A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT AND THAT'S REALLY OUR FOCUS. I HEAR THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF THERE WAS NO WIND IN MANY OF THOSE AREAS. WHY DO YOU NEED TO GO BACK AND CHECK THE LINES. SO MAYBE IT ISN'T IT I HEAR THE ANSWER BUT I DON'T REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT- THAT ANSWER AS SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW REALLY RED YOUR RESONATES WITH ME KNOWING. WE ARE WHAT WE HAD ON THE GROUND. SO TO SERVE GOING HAVING THAT YOU'LL GO BACK AND CHECK THOSE LINES THE WIND SPEED. GOT A- HOUSE NOW. WAS IT AND THAT'S THAT'S PART OF OUR PROTOCOL SO THE LINES I DON'T MEET THAT THRESHOLD BUT ARE INCLUDED IN SCOPE AS A RESULT OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THE INTERCONNECTED NATURE OF THE GRADE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY PART OF THE SLOPE. SO IN ESSENCE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET CREDIT. FOR GETTING THE POWER DOWN POWER BACK ON. A LOT QUICKER WHEN THERE WAS NO PROBLEM. SO I WOULD NATURALLY STATE THAT- CENTER BECAUSE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS ON OUR RESTORATION CAPABILITIES IN REGARDS TO TRAINING DOING ACTIVE DRILLS- HAVING OUR TEAMS BECOME VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE CIRCUITS DOING BOOTS ON THE GROUND PATROLS- DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE YEAR AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING. OUR AERIAL FLEET CAPABILITIES WE WENT FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT HELICOPTERS WE HAD LAST YEAR. TO MORE THAN FORTY. AT THE PEAK AND WE'RE LOOKING TO GO TO- UP TO SEVENTY- INCLUSIVE OF WORKING WITH THE OUR CALLOW YES PARTNERS TO LEVERAGE. NIGHT PATROLLING CAPABILITIES THROUGH FIXED WING AND WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE THAT PART OF OUR CURIOUSLY CAPABILITIES WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS. ON THE OPERATION SIDE FROM A RESTORATION PERSPECTIVE WOULD REALLY CAME TO BEAR AS WELL. I ACCEPT AND RESPECT THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU MY COLLEAGUES WERE ACTUALLY RATHER POLITE THE. MANY OF US WERE SITTING AT THE DíAS REPRESENT. YOUR SERVICE TERRITORY AND. GRANTED IT IS FAR MORE COMPLICATED IT IS LARGER IT IS MORE CUSTOMERS GEOGRAPHICALLY PHENOMENALLY LARGER TOPOGRAPHICALLY- THERE SO MANY SO MANY FACTORS SO. THAT IT IS MORE COMPLICATED I DON'T THINK ANY OF US UNDER ESTIMATE BY. YOU HAVE HAD WHETHER THEY WERE ADEQUATE OR NOT YOU HAVE HAD THE ABILITY OVER ALL OF THIS TIME AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING THE LAST THREE YEARS OF FIRES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T NEED THE LAST THREE YEARS OF FIRES THAT WE ARE IN A VERY HIGH FIRE DANGER AREA. STANLEY MORE. PERMITTED NOW BUT EVEN DURING THE DROUGHT. WE KNEW THAT WE WERE A GREAT FIRE RISK THAT ENTIRE TIME. AND CERTAINLY THE US EMBRATEL INCIDENT WAS MANY YEARS PRIOR SO THE ISSUE OF HAVING RATES TO COVER. THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF UTILITY FOR SAFETY MAINTENANCE AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. YOU HAVE THEM AT LEAST YOU HAD THAT WHICH YOU MORE ASKED FOR NOW IF YOU NEEDED MORE. THERE IS NOT BUT WE DON'T HAVE WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL THAT YOU NEED MORE. AND CERTAINLY OUR CUSTOMERS RATES ARE QUITE HIGH. AND YET. AT I THINK THAT I CAN SAY. WITHOUT SPEAKING OUT OF TURN. THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE NO MORE CONFIDENCE. IT IS UTILITY. AND DATE. HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR THE COMPANY NOW I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO GREAT MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AS MR MORNING SENATOR MORNING SHARED. I DON'T WANT THE P. JEANNIE WORKERS TO FEEL THE WRATH OF. THE A RATE PAYERS WHEN THEY ARE SO FRUSTRATED WITH THIS IT IS NOT FAIR FOR RIGHT TO TAKE IT OUT ON THOSE WORKERS- AND YOU ARE BOTH NEW. BUT WE'RE STILL IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. WE ARE BEING TOLD AS WAS JUST SENT TO MISTER REQUIRE AND SENATOR REQUIRED SENATOR DODD THEY COULD BE TEN YEARS THAT IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE SO I GUESS I'LL ALL I ASK IS. ARE YOU WILLING TO REVISE YOUR HARDENING AND RESILIENCY PLAN SO THAT YOU CAN. IT'S VERY PROMPTLY SO THAT YOU CAN EVALUATE THE BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES. THAT ARE MOST COST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE CLEARLY UNDER GROUNDING AS WE KNOW IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD NOT UNDERGROUND I'M JUST SAYING THAT IF WE PLAN IF THAT'S OUR PRIMARY. THAT'LL TAKE FOREVER CERTAINLY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SIMILARLY BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE REGION AND THE DROUGHTS AND THE TYPE OF VEGETATION THAT. IS VERY DIFFICULT BUT SOME OF THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HEARD THE OTHER UTILITIES. UTILIZING THAT ARE NOT UTILIZED IN THE SAME LEVEL BY P. JEANNIE. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT ALL OF US WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A REVISION. TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATE RESULTS WITH THE CHEAPER COST EFFECTIVE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED MUCH FASTER BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS UNDERGROUND EXPENSIVE IT TAKES A LONG TIME SO HOW CAN WE GET RESULTS MUCH FASTER. WELL THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES ABSOLUTELY WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT OTHER THINGS ACCELERATE- WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE OF HE THE RESEARCHER STOLEN SHAMELESSLY FROM OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SOUTH ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND IN FACT WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT- DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT THINGS IN THE RIGHT AWAY. WE NEED TO SWITCH FROM SOMETHING TO MORE HARDENING. AND SO YEAH WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE BEST SOLUTION AIR AND NOT MARRIED TO THE ONE WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY. WELL I THINK THAT ALL OF US WOULD EXPECT TO SEE. AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE BUT DONE WELL A REVISION TWO YEAR PLAN THAT REFLECTS THAT- I ALSO IN. TO ECHO SENATOR MAGUIRE'S. THE WAY I DESCRIBE THE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS FIRST I AM VERY VERY. RELIEVED THAT WE DID NOT HAVE DEATHS IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRE SEASON STARTS FAR. BUT WE CAN'T CREATED DISASTER TO AVERTED DISASTER AND IN THIS NEXT SET OF POWER OUTAGES WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE ESTIMATES OF THE TEMPERATURE DROPS TO THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES AND THERE ARE VERY FEW HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE AFTER A COUPLE OF NIGHTS. OF NO HEAT AT THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES NOW CERTAINLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE THEIR HEAT THROUGH NATURAL GAS AND PERHAPS IT DOESN'T AFFECT BUT THERE'S OFTEN EVEN THE BILL WOULD BE TO TURN IT ON THAT IS THEN ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED SO. WE I THINK WE REALLY. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANY DEATHS INTO HERE. I APPRECIATE RED RED CROSS MAY HAVE THEIR OWN SET OF PROTOCOLS BUT THEN YOU CAN'T RELY ON THEM YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE ANY DEATHS IN ANY OF THE AREAS BY ANY OTHER CUSTOMERS WHERE THIS NEXT. POWER OUTAGE IS SET UP. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN- I AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE COVERED IT. QUITE WELL IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES WITH- THE INFRASTRUCTURE ON WITH THE BLACKOUTS AMERICAN REPEAT THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON- HOW WE HAVE MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. DURING. FOUR FIVE SIX TEN YEARS WHATEVER IT IS THAT P. GINNY. SO FIRST WHAT WOULD YOU DO YOU AGREE WITH ME. ON THAT- CLEAN ENERGY STORAGE IS PREFERABLE TO DIESEL GENERATORS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO HAVE POWER DURING A BLACKOUT. YES OKAY. SO BY. WHO CAN I WANT TO ASK YOU THAT WOULD GIVEN NINE. AND WE NEED A LOT MORE PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES TO HAVE ENERGY STORAGE. IN CALIFORNIA WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. I AGREE GENERALLY WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PENETRATION IS AN- ABOUT PRETTY MUCH CONSUMED WITH BANKRUPTCY AND WILDFIRES I DON'T I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL TELL. THAT WE WOULD BE ACHIEVED A DECENT. JOHNS ON ON SOLAR- BUT ENERGY STORAGE IS WAY BEHIND IN PART BECAUSE TECHNOLOGIES NEWER- IT'S- MORE EXPENSIVE ALL THE COSTS ARE COMING DOWN- AND ONE OF THE REASONS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE GET THE COST TO COME DOWN AND GET THE PENETRATION TO HAPPEN. IS TO DO WHAT WE DID WITH THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE WHICH WAS TO HAVE A REBATE PROGRAM- AND WE HAVE A PROGRAM NOW- CALLED THE AFTER PROGRAM- AND WE ARE PASSED SENATE BILL SEVEN HUNDRED ODD LAST YEAR. THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT. WHICH CREATES A REBATE PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS FOR BUSINESS SAYS FOR SCHOOLS FOR- WHOEVER ELSE TO TRY TO. MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE TO INSTALL ENERGY STORAGE IN ADDITION BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT WAS AT THE SEVEN YEAR PROGRAM. IT CREATES CERTAINTYFOR THE INDUSTRY- THAT THIS REBATE PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE AROUND A DOZEN VERY EVERY YEAR. THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS MONEY IS THERE AND IT WILL BE THERE- AND SO THEY WILL INVEST AND INNOVATE. TAB BETTER AND BETTER STORAGE TECHNOLOGY AND TO CONTINUE TO BRING THE COST DOWN SO THE ONE BLACKOUTS HAPPEN PEOPLE CAN HAVE THE STORAGE WITHOUT HAVING TO BURN A DIESEL- SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IN THOUGHTS PRICING THIS IS THE THIRD TIME OF RECESSION. IN THIS HEARING- THAT P. GINNY IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER I'LL USE IS CURRENTLY ASKING A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION NOT TO PUBLICLY FIND A SEASON NOT TO FULLY FUND. THE AFTER PROGRAM- NO EDISON THOSE TAKEN THE POSITION THAT IT NEEDS TO BE POINTED SINCE TWO YEARS AT A TIME WHICH IS COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING A SEVEN YEAR. PERIOD P. GINNY HAS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT THE- BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A SURPLUS IN THE FUND RIGHT NOW. WHICH IS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE PROGRAM- AND SO- THAT'S WHY THIS- SURPLUS HAS ACCUMULATED I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE SURPLUS WILL BE UTILIZED OVERTIME. P. GINNY HAS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD QUOTE RESPOND SPAT AND COMMIT INSIDE OF FUNDS AND QUOTE. INSTEAD OF ALLOCATING MAP AND TOWARDS IT- AND SO IN OTHER WORDS AND THE OUT THE FINE EITHER BY REDUCING PEOPLES- BILLS OR- OR- WHATEVER. FOR LESS THAN FULL FUNDING OF YESTER PROGRAM I THINK THAT IT IS IN P. GINNY'S INTEREST AND IS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST TO HAVE MORE ENERGY STORAGE OF THE PEOPLE CAN KEEP THEIR LIGHTS ON. AND SO I WANT TO ASK YOU IS P. GINNY OPENED TO ACTUALLY SUPPORTING FULL FUNDING OF THIS PROGRAM A PROGRAM THAT WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. SO THE SECOND TIME YOU ASKED THE QUESTION TODAY I LEANED OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AND SAID I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GET ASKED THIS QUESTION. AND THEN I GOT CALLED UP HERE BEFORE I GOT THE ANSWER. SO I'M WILLING. TO LOOK AT ANYTHING AND THINK ABOUT ANYTHING I CAN I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BACKGROUND TO ANSWER EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASKED BUT I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO. THINK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT IT COME VISIT WITH YOU ABOUT IT. I THINK THAT IT WOULD CREATE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GOOD WILL- WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE- IF THE UTILITIES IMPEACHING IN PARTICULAR- WERE TO YOU KNOW. REALLY SUPPORT BEFORE FUNDING AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A SMART INDIVIDUALS HOMES IS ABOUT BUSINESSES ABOUT SCHOOLS IT'S ABOUT- FARMERS. NONE WHO ARE LOSING THEIR CROPS AND WANT TO BEGENERATE THEIR OWN OUR IN STORE IT SO I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER WORKING WITH US AND- I ALSO JUST GOING MORE BROADLY. WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF FIGHTS AGAIN THIS IS NOT SAYS P. GINNY IT'S WITH THE UTILITIES AND- WITH- SOMETIMES OTHERS. ON ABOUT- DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE- PROGRAMS AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO INSTALL THE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE A HISTORICALLY REFLEXIVELY OPPOSE THAT AND SEEN AS SOME SORT OF THREAT- BUT AGAIN I THINK. NOW WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE AND THAT WILL BE HAPPENING. UNFORTUNATELY IT APPEARS FOR AWHILE. WE GOTTA HAVE MORE DVRS AND I WON A YOU KNOW- CAN I ASK YOUR WHICH IS P. JEANNIE OPEN TO SUPPORTING EXPANSION OF DVRS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ABSOLUTELY I THINK IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY IN REMINDS ME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE INDUSTRY. EDISON AGAINST WESTINGHOUSE RIGHT THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT LOCAL VERSUS BIG SYSTEM AND I THINK. TO REALLY METERS WILDFIRE RISK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO MORE. YEAH AND I MEAN I DO I WILL SAY THAT I DO I HAD MY STAFF WE PULLED- P. GINNY IS LOBBYING REPORT FOR I GUESS IT'S FOR- APRIL FIRST TO SIFT. TO JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR AND THERE ARE. DR BILLS AND ONCE IT IS HERE THAT P. GINNY LOBBIED AGAINST WHICH AGAIN OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT. YOU NEED NOT JUST P. GINNY THE OTHER I- USES WELL. LOBBY AGAINST PRETTY MUCH EVERY SINGLE D. E. R. BILL THAT'S INTRODUCED IN THE LEGISLATURE AND TRY TO EITHER KILL IT OR GUIDE IT- YOU KNOW WE HAD A BILL THIS YEAR SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT THAT MOVED THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE WITH. BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- IT WAS AN COMPLETELY GUIDED AND WE HAD TO ABANDON THE BILL AND CAN THAT'S ONE OF THE BILL'S A P. GINNY LOBBIED. AGAINST AND SO I. YOU KNOW ARE YOU LIKE NEXT YEAR HOW MUCH HOW MUCH YOU ANTICIPATE P. GINNY WILL SPEND THE LOBBY AGAINST D. E. R. LEGISLATION. OR TO LOBBY THE COMMISSION AGAINST YOURS. PROBABLY ONE COME CLOSE THE INTERNET IS GOOD I REALLY HOPE THAT THE ANSWER IS ZERO. I'D LIKE YOU TO FOCUS THE MONEY ON FIXING SYSTEM AND AVOIDING THE BLACKOUTS AND NOT MAKING IT HARDER. FOR PEOPLE. TO GET SOLAR AND STORAGE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISS CHEER AND I'LL BE REAL BRIEF BUT WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS- OUR LOW INCOME AND OUR MEDICAL BASS LINE. AND. AS WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE'S A RATE MECHANISM IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY IDENTIFY THAT CUSTOMER ON THE GRID FOR YOU ON OUR PARTICULAR CIRCUIT SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HELP IDENTIFY THOSE CUSTOMERS SPECIALLY IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A CELL PHONE THEY DO NOT HAVE A COMPUTER. SO YOU CAN PROVIDE. ADEQUATE CONTACT AT EIGHT IN A TIMELY MANNER BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR MEDICAL BASS LINE YOU GUYS ALBUM ON A MAP YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND THAT'S AND THAT'S OR THE CASE HISTORY MECHANISM. JUST LIKE HERE AS I'M A CORRECT. LARA CENTER BRADFORD THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- OBVIOUSLY WE DO KNOW WERE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS ARE AND IF WE DON'T RECEIVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION WITH THOSE CUSTOMERS AND WE ARE REACH THEM WE WILL SEND AN AND ONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES TO THEIR HOME- AND MAKE EVERY ATTEMPT TO MAKE POSITIVE- COMMUNICATION WITH THEM IN ADVANCE OF THE WILDFIRE SEASON WE'VE BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH THESE CUSTOMERS THROUGH ALL MEANS OF COMMUNICATION E-MAIL PHONE EMAIL- THROUGH SOCIAL CHANNELS RADIO TELEVISION A TO ENSURE THAT WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE WHERE THEY ARE. AND RECEIVE THEIR CONTACT ATION. WE WILL KING VERY CLOSELY IN ADDITION WITH OUR COUNTIES TO IDENTIFY THIS POPULATION AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES. IN ADDITION WE WILL BE STANDING UP ED AFN ADVISORY COUNCIL THAT WILL HELP ADVISE THE COMPANY ON HOW WE CAN. REACH OUT EVEN FURTHER TO CUSTOMERS THAT- HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS CUSTOMERS THAT NEED OUR SUPPORT IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY BE VERY OPEN TO THE FEEDBACK. IN ADDITION WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE COUNTIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE A GREATER REACH TO THESE COMMUNITIES AND TO THESE CUSTOMERS AND WILL BE LEVERAGING OUR FOUNDATION FUNDING AND SUPPORT FOR THE COUNTIES. AND COMMUNITIES NOT TO OVERBURDEN THE COUNTIES WE DON'T WANNA OVER BURDEN THEM WITHOUT THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT- THAT THEY'LL NEED. TO SUPPORT THESE CUSTOMERS BUT WE WANT TO DO THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM. AND MY LAST QUESTION IT WILL NOT NO SIR BECAUSE FROM THE STATE AND IT WAS A QUESTION BY BOTH SENATOR DODD AND ANSWER MCGUIRE AS IT RELATES TO SOME YOUR TRANSMISSION WHY SOME OF THEM. WEREN'T TURNED OFF AND AS A INDIVIDUAL WHO WORKED FOR TWELVE YEARS FOR UTILITY I'M NOT HERE TO DEFEND YOU BUT SOMETIMES A TRANSMISSION LINE IS FOR FULL TO MANAGEMENT AND LOAD MANAGEMENT. AN AREA WERE IT'S SAFE AND YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO DELIVER POWER TO THAT AREA MY CORRECT. AND SOMETIMES YOU SHOULD BE IT BY TURNING THAT OFF YOU IMPACT MORE FOLKS ARE NOT EVEN IN IN IN THE FIRE DANGERS ON OF MY CORRECT. THAT SO SOMETIMES IS ABOUT LOW MANAGEMENT AND IT'S NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM I MEAN SOME OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS BEEN THERE A HUNDRED PLUS YEARS SO I UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU CENTER AND THAT THOSE EXACTLY MY REFERENCE TO GREAT STABILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT GROUP THANK YOU.

LIABLE ON AFFORDABLE. MANESAR OUR FOCUS- AT EXIT THAT IS REPAIR NEUTRAL FAIR TREATMENT OF VICTIMS OF ALL ALIGNED WITH CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND ALL IN RECOGNITION OF THAT- RETAINING AND SUPPORTING. THE STAFF THAT DOES THIS WORK IN THE UTILITY IS CRITICAL TO HAVE THE TYPE OF TRANSFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED TO. ENSURE THAT AS WE ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE WE DO IT IN A WAY WE'RE THE TYPE OF DESTRUCTION THE CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED. IS NOT A NEW NORMAL- SO I'M HAPPY TO. TO STOP THEIR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE BACK AND BUT DIRECTOR DEALER DO CHEERED AFTERWARDS SERVICES- WE'LL- TALK ABOUT SOME OF WHAT WE LEARNED SOME OF. WHAT WE DID AND MY COLLEAGUES WILL CONTINUE FROM THERE. MR GREAT OR THE COMPUTER AFTER MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE UP MARKET ARE DUE TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. FIRST LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT THE SCOPE AND THE SCALE OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED BY THE UTILITIES IN OCTOBER. RESULT IN A SERIES OF VERY COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING CONDITIONS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO COLLECTIVELY MANAGE SOMEBODY GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE SO MANY. SO MANY THINGS THAT WENT ALL THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT- WE HAD THE ENGAGE WITH. WHAT SUSAN OF COURSE TO IMPLEMENT THAT- PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF RESTED SOLELY WITH UTILITIES. THAT DECISION ALONG WITH THE RED FLAG FIRE OTHER CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. RESULTED IN THE STATE HAVE TO MANAGE THE MEDI CASCADING A COMPLEX CONSEQUENCES THAT ENSUED. LEVERAGING ALL OF OUR WELL ESTABLISHED PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE SYSTEMS ARE PRIMARY EFFORT WAS TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO PROTECT RESIDENTS AND. TO MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS TO LIFE PROPERTY A FIRE. THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES OF COURSE OR WITH THESE- OCTOBER PS PS ADVANCE PROTECT IN THE- IS WHERE THE OUTAGES OVERLAPPED. OR EXTENDED FOR MULTIPLE DAYS INCLUDING JUST THE SHEER FREQUENCY OF THE EVENTS. THE SCOPE THE SCALE AND THE ULTIMATE CASCADING INTER DEPENDENT. LIFELINE IMPACTS IN THE AREAS THAT WERE DE ENERGIZED WHAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING OVER TIME WAS REALLY GETTING DOWN YOU KNOW IN THE DETAIL IN ON THE GROUND AND AFFECTING SO MANY DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR LIVES. LEADING UP TO THE OCTOBER P. S. P. S. P. JEANNIE HAD INITIATED THREE SMALLER MORE DEFINED PSP S. OFFENSE IN SCOPE AND SCALE IN JUNE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY OCTOBER. THE LONGEST LASTING ROUGHLY TWO AND A HALF DAYS AND IMPACTING BETWEEN FIVE AND TWELVE COUNTIES RESTORATION FOLLOWING THOSE SMALLER VANCE WAS DONE RELATIVELY RAPIDLY. BETWEEN OCTOBER NINTH AND OCTOBER ELEVENTH P. GINNY MADE THE DECISION TO DE ENERGIZED A MUCH BROADER AREA IMPACTING THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES- WITH AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION WHICH YOU ARE ARE YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL. IT DOCTOR OVER P. GINNY AND SHE HATED THREE BACK TO BACK PS PS EVENTS ON OCTOBER TWENTY THIRD TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY NINTH RESPECTIVELY. AGAIN ATTEMPTING THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES MANY OF WHICH HAD BEEN DE ENERGIZED SEVERAL TIMES PREVIOUSLY AT THIS POINT THE FREQUENCY AND THE SCALE OF THESE EVENTS WAS EVOLVING INTO REAL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. OCTOBER TWENTY THIRD PREVENT P. GINNY DEANNA JACKSON ESTIMATED. FOUR HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SEVENTEEN COUNTY WHICH LASTED ABOUT TWO DAYS THIS WAS THAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED ON THE TWENTY SIX. WITH A DEEP IS IT OF THE THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHICH LASTED FOR OVER FIVE DAYS AND WHILE P. JEANNIE WAS WORKING YOUR POWER FROM THE TWENTY SIX THE VAN WHICH THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SOME BUT ALL ALL NOT ALL. AREAS THE INITIATED. YES. ON OCTOBER TWENTY NINTH. OVERLAP TOO MANY OF THE SAME COUNTIES THERE ALREADY DE ENERGIZED FROM THE TWENTY SIX EVENT. WHICH LASTED THROUGH NOVEMBER FIRST THIS OVERALL IMPACTED AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF TWO POINT FOUR MILLION. IN THAT OVERLAP APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHO OF THOSE WHO WERE DE ENERGIZED ON THE TWENTY SIX DID NOT SEE THEIR POWER RESTORED FOR MORE THAN SIX DAYS AND WEIRD UP TO ELEVEN DAYS AS A PARTS OF THE STATE. AT THE SAME TIME P. GINNY WAS EXECUTING PS PS SONORA CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. WAS IMPLEMENTING A SERIES OF PSP ESTEVEZ STARTING ON OCTOBER NINTH AND RUNNING THROUGH OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH IMPACTING PORTIONS OF UP TO SIX SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHICH LASTED BETWEEN TWO AND EIGHT DAYS. AND BETWEEN OCTOBER TENTH AND OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH SANTEE GAS ELECTRIC ALSO IMPLEMENTED THREE SEPARATE PS PS EVENTS IMPACTING AN ESTIMATED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE EACH VARYING INTEGRATION FROM SEVERAL HOURS TO EIGHT DAYS. SO AND ALL ARE DURING THE TIME FRAME- IN MID OCTOBER TO LATE OCTOBER ALL THREE UTILITIES WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPLEMENTING P. S. P. S. ADDING TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE OVERALL SITUATION. BEYOND THE DIRECT IMPACT TO INDIVIDUALS AT THIS POINT PARTICULARLY. AS THE OUTAGES EXTENDED INTO MULTIPLE DAYS. IMPACTS TO HEALTH AND MEDICAL. WRITERS SCHOOLS FUEL AND COMMODITY DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TELECOMMUNICATIONS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT A SECOND TRANSPORTATION MANUFACTURING CRIMINAL JUSTICE WATER DELIVERY AND WASTE WATER MANAGEMENT EMERGED JUST TO NAME A FEW. GIVEN THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE PSP HAS ADVANCED GIVEN BY EXPECTED RED FLAG FIRE CONDITIONS ACROSS THE STATE HELLO YES ACTIVATED THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER FOR OVER HALF OF OCTOBER TO ADDRESS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PS PS EVENTS. THAT WERE OCCURRING. LEANING IN IN A BIG WAY WE MOBILIZED OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY. HELLO YES STAFF AND CLOSE TO NINETY STATE AGENCIES TO SUPPORT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER TO PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND TO THE MANY- COUNTY IO SEES THAT WERE ACTIVATED TO DEAL WITH THE CONDITIONS. AS WELL CALIFORNIA ENHANCE STAFFING PATTERNS AND PRE POSITION ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND CAL- YES STRATEGICALLY PRE POSITION MULTIPLE- YES A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE STRIKE TEAMS IN TASK FORCES IN AREAS. WITH HIGH FIRE THREAT AND PS PS ADVANCE. WE DISPATCH LAYS ON PERSONAL FROM CALLOW YES CAL FIRE AND THE CPU SKI TO EACH OF THE UTILITIES EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER. AND WE DEPLOYED STATE INCIDENT PLANNING SPECIALIST TO BE G. E. O. C. TO PROVIDE EXPERTISE ON USING THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM. THIS COORDINATEDEFFORT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN MAXIMIZING PREPAREDNESS LEVELS RESPONDING QUICKLY TO EMERGENCY EMERGING STE SIT SITUATIONS ENSURING FOR GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WITH RAPID RESPONSE TO FIRE AND PROTECTION TO LIFE AND PROPERTY. IN PREPARATION OF THE PS PS ADVANCE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAD BEEN MEETING JOINTLY. WITH WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THREE UTILITIES ALONG WITH THE CPUC AND CAL FIRE WEEKLY. FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR AND WE JUST HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE UTILITIES- BJ TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY'VE HAD- THE REASON WE WERE HAVING THESE MEETINGS WAS TO BUY DOWN OR MITIGATE THOSE KIND OF CHALLENGES THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH. OUR GOAL WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE TO ENSURE THAT THE UTILITIES RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS OUR OWN CONCERNS AND EXPECTATIONS- OF NAB OF NAVIGATING A P. S. P. S. ADVANTAGE AND A PROVIDING SAFE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS WITH AMP AMPLE NOTIFICATION. OF PENDING PS PS EVENTS AND PROVIDE ACCURATE ONGOING CRITICAL INFORMATION AND DATA TO BOTH OF US IN THE PUBLIC. THROUGHOUT THESE MEETINGS WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL THREE UTILITIES WERE DEVELOPING OPERATIONAL CHECK OPERATIONAL CONSTRUCTS. PUBLIC FACING MESSAGING. WOULD EXERCISE A MORE CONSISTENT. AND TRANSPARENT ACROSS THE BOARD CONSISTENT AND TRANSPARENT ACROSS THE BOARD APPROACH WITH REGARD TO THEIR PUBLIC EDUCATION THEIR DECISION MAKING THERE ARE NOTIFICATIONS TO THE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TO THE ACTUAL EXECUTION OF A P. S. P. S. EVENT ITSELF. STILL AFTER ALL THAT DURINGTHE MULTIPLE PSP AS EVENTS THERE CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGES AND INCONSISTENCIES. INCONSISTENCIES WITH UTILITIES ABILITY TO PROVIDE DETAILED AND TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF THEIR PLANNED OUTAGES REQUIRED DATA AND DETAILED MAPS OF OUTAGE AREAS DETAILS ON CRITICAL MEDICAL BASS LINE IN VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS. AT SUPPORT TO CUSTOMERS IN AREAS WITHOUT TO USE ANY INFORMATION RELATED TO OTHER CRITICAL OR ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS WAS QUITE FRUSTRATING DOES PARTICULARLY WHEN WE STARTED TO ROLL INTO THESE BIGGER PROBLEMS WHICH WE AS YOUR STATES BOB SEASONED AMER TO SEE MANAGEMENT TEAM- ANTICIPATED IN THOSE MEETINGS THAT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND WANTED TO ADDRESS THEM WITHIN THE PREVIOUS YEAR BEFORE WE STARTED THE PS PS EVENTS. THE DETAILS HERE MATTER I DETAIL ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PUT A COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN PLACE AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE THERE AND HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BE OPEN AND WHAT KIND OF DEMOGRAPHICS ARE GONNA BE SERVE THERE OR HOW MANY BASS INE MEDICAL BASED LIKE BECAUSE THOSE DETAILS MATTER YOU CAN'T HIT THAT WITH THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT OVERVIEW. AND THEN EXPECT- BUT THE ABILITY TO RESPOND AND SO THIS IS WHERE THEY CAN GET INTO THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT RAIL ALL WE HAVE TO BE A BIG ACCOUNTING FOR THOSE THOSE THINGS BECAUSE DETAILS EQUAL LIVES IS VERY IMPORTANT. THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE EVENTS WE CONTINUE TO COORDINATE WITH UTILITIES- SPECIFICALLY PGD TO ENSURE THAT THEIR COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS RESPONDED TO THE APPROPRIATE SCALE OF THE POPULATIONS IMPACTED BY THE PSP AS A VET. AS THEY WERE ADDING BIGGER AREA AS THEY NEEDED TO RAPIDLY INCREASE THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THEIR C. R. C.'S AND TOOK TO THE TO THEIR CREDIT. THEY WENT FROM YOU TO ONE PER COUNTY TO THREE PER COUNTY- BUT THEY WERE STILL ONLY OPEN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WERE STILL NEEDING- SERVICES IN THE EVENING TIME- BAIT WE WANTED THEM TO REMAIN OPEN AS LONG AS POSSIBLE EACH DAY TO PROVIDE RESIDENTS WITH WATER ICE BLANKETS INFORMATION. AND POWER TO CHARGE DEVICES DURING OUTAGES. MY OFFICE AS WELL FACILITY TO ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SECURITY AT THESE SITES WHICH SEEM TO BE A CONCERN FOR P. JEANNIE. AND WE ALSO TEAMED UP WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION MONIES IN THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES TO HELP KEEP- OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE IMPACTED AREAS UPDATED. AS WELL AS INSURING THAT P. JEANNIE WEBSITE AND CALL CENTERS WERE PREPARED TO SUPPORT AGAIN THE SCALE OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT COULD BE CALLING IN. OF COURSE AS WE ALL KNOW THIS INCLUDED DEPLOYMENT OF STATE PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES TO HELP TEACH ME STAND UP A NEW WEBSITE. TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AFTER THE PRIMARY SITE CRASH YOUR HILL A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT FROM SECRETARY LEE IN A MINUTE. LASTLY TO ASSIST P. GINNY ACCELERATE TIME- OF POWER RESTORATION- AS WE HEARD THERE SO MANY LIGHTS IT NEED TO BE INSPECTED. ARE WE OFFERED AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEPLOYED PLANES AND HELICOPTERS WITH SPECIALIZED FORWARD LOOKING IF IT CAMERA TECHNOLOGY. FROM THE H. P. AND THE NATIONAL GUARD. TO HELP P. GINNY INCREASE THE SPEED. HELP THAT THAT HELPFUL FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THE TIME FOR RESTORATION LET ME SAY THAT AND WHILE THE PS PS ADDRESS IN- OCTOBER PRESENTED US ALL WITH A SERIES OF COMPLEX CHALLENGES. CALIFORNIA'S EXTENSIVE CAPABILITIES AND EXPERIENCE WITH MANAGING MAJOR EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS INCLUDING THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR EXTENSIVE MUTUAL AID SYSTEMS PROVIDED THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE BOTH THE PS PS IMPACTS AS WELL AS MEDICAID SEVERAL FIRES THAT WERE BY MILITARY SEE OCCURRING IN BOTH NORTHERN. CALIFORNIA LET ME JUST CLOSE BY ONE QUICK. ONE MORE QUICK ME AND TALK ABOUT TELECOMMUNICATIONS ONE OF THE- KEY ARE A LIFELINE IMPACTS CRITICAL LIFELINE IMPACTS THAT- WAS HIGHLIGHTED- WAS WITH REGARDS TO OUR TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM. OUT WHILE MANY CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE POWER OUTAGES THEY ALSO EXPERIENCE GAPS AND OUTAGES IN THEIR CELL LANDLINE IN INTERNET OR WHAT WE CALL WIRELINE SERVICES IN SEVERAL CASES EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT IN THE DE ENERGIZED ZONE. THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS COUPLE WITH NUMEROUS DANNY'S FIRES WE WERE MANAGING THROUGHOUT THE STATE HIGHLIGHTED ONCE AGAIN AS I BEEN BEFORE YOU ALL BEFORE ON THIS TOPIC. THE VULNERABILITIES OF OUR PRIVATELY OWNED AND PRIVATELY MANAGED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. AS I STATED EARLIER WE LOST A NUMBER OF CELL SITES SOME SIXTEEN HUNDRED- AND WIRELINE SERVICES SOME EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND CUSTOMERS THAT WAS FOR BOTH FOR BOTH BOYS. A VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL AND WIRELINE BACK CALL- IN THE PS PS EVENT. THAT WAS DUE TO LACK OF ABOUT POWER BACK UP AND OF OR LACK OF SUSTAINABILITY. AND IN MARIN COUNTY ALONE 57% OF THE ENTIRE CELLULAR SITES WERE LOST AT ONE POINT IN MENDOCINO COUNTY THEY LOST ALL SELL LAND LINE AND THE ABILITIES. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS THAT THAT YOU HAVE THEY HAVE PEOPLE HAVE THE INABILITY. THE INABILITY TO CALL NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY INABILITY TO RECEIVE ALERTS ANDWARNINGS. THE INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH FAMILY OR JUST TO BUSINESS THE INABILITY FOR HOSPITALS AND I'M ONE CENTERS OR CRIMINAL JUSTICE HAS TO SEND OR RECEIVE CRITICAL DATA. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IN THIS CASE THE INABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE POWER OUTAGES. AND OR COMMUNITY RESOURCES OR RESTORATION INFORMATION. GIVEN THAT THE UTILITIES SOUL STRATEGY FOR THE PUBLIC WAS TO DRIVE THEIR CUSTOMERS TO A WEBSITE THAT THEY COULDN'T GET ON BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET THROUGH THE WIRELINE SYSTEM. SO IT WAS A VERY FRUSTRATING LOOP OF CASCADING FAILURES THAT REALLY CREATED- I ATE A MAJOR. THREAT TO LIFE AND SAFETY NOTHING pFRUSTRATING AND WE HAVE SEEN THE SCENARIO NOW OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOLLOWING ONE DISASTER AFTER ANOTHER. SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT- Là WITH THE CELL SITES BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING MORE THAN I THINK. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THEIR A NUMBER OF LIFELINE CRITICAL LIFE AYE INTER DEPENDENCIES BUT- BEYOND THE POWER GOING OUT AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE NEEDING MEDIC MEDICAL. CARE AND I MAY THINK YOU'RE HERE ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES FROM DOCTOR GALLEY- CELL SYSTEM WHICH IS SUCH A CRITICAL CRITICAL LIFE LINE- THAT FAILURE WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. K. WE HAVE JULIE LEAH THINKER ONE NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JULIE LEE AND I AM THE ACTING SECRETARY OF THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW GOV OPS DEPARTMENTS RESPONDED TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICE IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WAS ASKED BY THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO P. JEANNIE ON THEIR WEBSITE DURING THE FIRST SHOT OFF OF AND AROUND OCTOBER NINTH. PGA ANY WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE INCOMING VOLUME OF TRAFFIC AND THE WEBSITE HAD CRASHED DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE POWER SHUT OFFS. AS SOON AS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY RECEIVE THE CALL. AMY TONG CITY TEASE DIRECTOR IMMEDIATELY PUT TOGETHER A TEAM OF EXPERTS WHO INITIATED CONTACT WITH P. GENIES IT STAFF. I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE STAFF WERE VERY COLLABORATIVE TO WORK WITH. CDT PROVIDED THREE CATEGORIES OF SERVICE TO P. JEANNIE. THE FIRST WAS TO PROVIDE ADVICE AND CONSULTATION TO P. GENIES I. T. UNIT TO ADDRESS P. GENIES WEBSITE PERFORMANCE ISSUES. CITY TV GAVE PGA ANY FEEDBACK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR CLOUD ARCHITECTURE AND IDENTIFIED MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRONGER VENDOR MANAGEMENT OF THEIR CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS. THE TEAM ALSO PROVIDED CONSULTING SERVICES ON THE CONFIGURATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A SITE DEDICATED TO THE OUTAGE MAPS TO SEGMENT INCOMING WEBSITE TRAFFIC AWAY FROM P. GENIES MAIN SITE. THE TEAM THEN PROACTIVELY CONFIGURED AND DEVELOPED A BACKUP SITE TO ACCOMMODATE THE TRAFFIC TO THE MAP SITE JUST IN CASE P. JEANNIE WOULD NEED IT. THE SECOND ACTION TAKEN BY CDT. WAS TO ENGAGE THE VENDORS THAT P. JEANNIE USES FOR THEIR WEB SERVICES.

JEANNIE STAFFER ABLE TO FOCUS ON GETTING THE MAPS ON TO A CLOUD SITE WELL THE CD TO YOU TEAM WORKS WITH THE VENDORS TO INCREASE CAPACITY. LASTLY THE CITY T. TEAM PROVIDED DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE SHOOTING AND LOAD TESTING ON THE MAP SITE TO ENSURE THE P. GENIES SITE COULD WITHSTAND A LARGE TRUCK TRAFFIC VOLUMES ABOUT CRASHING AGAIN. THE VENDORS ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE LOAD TESTING WAS TWELVE HOURS SO CDT DID THE TESTING THEMSELVES TO SAVE TIME. AFTER LOAD TESTING THE PUBLIC FACING PS PS WEBSITE CD TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO OPTIMIZE THE SITE WAS TO RESIZE THE DATABASE SERVER AND OPTIMIZE STORAGE TO MINIMIZE WEBSITE LAG. THIS IS A LITTLE TECHNICAL BUT THANKS TO THE DIAGNOSTIC AND LOAD TESTING CD T. WAS ABLE TO ADVISE THE CONTRACTORAS READ TO REBUILD THE MAPPING SITE USING A PREVIOUS VERSION OF CODE BECAUSE OF CONTINUING ISSUES THE TEAM FOUND WITH THE NEW CODE BASE. THESE CHANGES ADJUSTED THE CONFIGURATION TO INCREASE TECH SCALING THAT WOULD SUPPORT OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CONCURRENT USERS ONCE P. GENIES SITE WENT LIVE AGAIN CD TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE WITH THE SITE WITH THE SITE. TESTING IT TO MAKE SURE THE CONTENT SEE BY VISITORS WAS. CORRECT AND FUNCTIONING. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON ALSO EXPERIENCE SOME ISSUES WITH THEIR WEBSITE DURING THE FIRST PS PS OF AND AGAIN AROUND OCTOBER NINTH. THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY CONTACTED SOCAL EDISON AND OFFERED ASSISTANCE FACILITATED EXECUTIVE LEVEL CONTACTS WITH MICROSOFT AND MONITORED THE SO CAL EDISON SITE. DURING THE SECOND PS PS EVENT LATER IN OCTOBER DIRECTOR TONG AND HER TEAM SUGGESTED THAT THE STATE BILL THE PORTAL TO CONSOLIDATE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE FIRE INFORMATION. AS WELL AS THE SECOND PS PS INFORMATION SINCE WE HAD OVERLAPPING DISASTERS. ONCE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SHOT OFFICE WAS REALIZED APPROVAL WAS GIVEN FOR NEW PORTAL NAME TO RESPONSE DOT CA DOT GOV.

FROM KEPT CONCEPTION TO IMPLEMENTATION OVER A WEEKEND WITH A DOZEN STAFF CDT BUILT THIS ONE STOP SHOP WEBSITE IN LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. A DEVOPS TEAM OF C. D. T. DEVELOPERS AND ENGINEERS WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE GOV UPS TO FUNNEL CONTENT FROM MANY OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS. INCLUDING CAL FIRE- YES HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CALLIE PA AND MANY OTHERS. THEY DESIGNED BUILT TESTED AND DEPLOYED THE CURRENT RESPONSE DOT CA DOT GOV WEBSITE ON CD TO USE ROBUST PLATFORM THAT COULD HANDLE HIGH VOLUMES OF WEBSITE TRAFFIC. THE TEAM PROVIDED RAPID IN IT OR ABOUT UPDATES TO THE WEBSITE FOLLOWING THE LAUNCH TO ENSURE THE MOST UP TO DATE AND RELEVANT INFORMATION WAS POSTED. THE INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY SIZING AND DELIVERY OF THE WEBSITE AND IT'S ASSOCIATED TEST AND DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS WERE PROVISIONED LEVERING THE LEVERAGING THE EXISTING PLATFORM. THE WEBSITE ARCHITECTURE UTILIZED A CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK OR CD AND TO INCREASE THE SPEED AND RESILIENCY OF THE SITE IN ANTICIPATION OF TRAFFIC VOLUME. AVERAGE PAGE ACCESS TIME WAS LESS THAN TWO MILLISECONDS THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WITH PREPAID CELL PHONES OR SPOTTY CELL SERVICE WHERE THEY MAY HAVE ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO DATA FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. CDT ALSO HEARD THAT RESPONSE DOT CA DOT GOV MEANT THE AMERICAN DISABILITY ACT OR ADA STANDARDS FOR WEBSITE ACCESSIBILITY AND THAT ALL CONTENT WAS TRANSLATED INTO MULTIPLE LANGUAGES IN AN EFFORT TO REACH ALL COMMUNITIES IMPACTED. THE OTHER GOV OPS DEPARTMENT THAT WAS ACTIVATED DURING THE PS PS EVENTS WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WHENEVER THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ACTIVATES THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WE DEPLOYED STAFF FROM DG US TO ENSURE THERE IS IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO ANY RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED DURING A DISASTER. WHETHER IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE FOR FIRE RESPONSE OR THE POWERSHOT OFFICE DID YOU HAVE STAFF WORKED ON EMERGENCY CONTRACTS AND PURCHASING AND THEY ALSO MONITOR ALL STATE OWNED BUILDINGS AND PROPERTY. DID YOU HAS COMPLETED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MISSION TASK DURING THE LATE OCTOBER FIRES IN PS PS EVENTS. AGS IS MONITORING OF STATE PROPERTIES ALLOWS US TO REPORT THAT INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SO THEY'RE IMMEDIATELY WHERE OF ANY IMPACTS IS THE STATE SERVICES. THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES OR KELLY CHAR USE THE DATA GATHERED BY THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER ON IMPACTS TO STATE EMPLOYEES. IN KEEPS EMPLOYEE UNIONS NOTIFIED OF THOSE IMPACTS TO THEIR MEMBERS. INCLUDES MY TESTIMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MARK GALEAZZO CALLIE DOLLY GALLAGHER HI. AND DOCTOR MARK KELLY- SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU ABOUT THE EFFORTS OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DURING AND OUR MANY DEPARTMENTS DURING THE PS PS EVENTS ARE OF LAST MONTH AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED BOTH THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF THE RECENT RECENT SHUT OFFS WERE UNPRECEDENTED LEAVING MILLIONS. OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT POWER FOR DAYS THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF PUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ON OF ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THOSE WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. DIRE SITUATION. TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS WHO WE HEARD FROM DAILY WEATHER WAS BY TWEETER BY EMAIL OR BY PHONE CALL. THAT HAD- DEPENDED ON LIFE SUSTAINING EQUIPMENT BREATHING MACHINES DIALYSIS MACHINES NEBULIZER MACHINES WHEELCHAIRS OR MEDICATIONS WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT EARLIER LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS NOT CHEAP MEDICATION. THAT DEPENDED ON REFRIGERATION. I'D LIKE TO SPEND MY TIME TODAY OUTLINING THE GAPS WE SAW ON THESE EFFORTS HOW WE RESPONDED AND LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED. FOR RESPONSE EFFORTS TO THE SHOT OFFICE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR FOCUSED ON FILLING CLEARING GAPS LEFT BY THE I WOULD USE OUR TEAM STEPPED UP TO ENSURE THAT THE ON MY MEDICAL NEEDS FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE NEIGHBORS. ACROSS THE STATE WOULD BE MAD IN THIS TIME. WE HAD TO KEEP PRIORITIES ENSURE INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN OUR FACILITIES WHETHER THOSE ARE THE ONES LICENSE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SOCIAL SERVICES WERE SAFE AND HAD NO MAN ON MAN NEEDS. WE ALSO WANTED TO BE SURE THAT VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALSLIVING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHETHER THOSE ARE. KIDS IN FOSTER CARE PEOPLE DISABILITIES THE ELDERLY LIVING IN COMMUNITIES OF THE ROUND WERE SAFE AND ALSO HAD NO ONE MAN NEEDS. FOR THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES WE LICENSE IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO PREPARE FOR THE PS PS ADVANCE. BECAUSE THE INFORMATION COMING FROM THE UTILITIES. WAS A RADIC IMPRECISE AND OFTEN CHANGING WE ARE THIS IS A CONSISTENT THEME EARLIER I THINK IT APPLIED TO THE FACILITIES THAT WE LOOK AFTER. IN IN VERY REAL WAYS. INCREASINGLY IT BECAME HARDER AND HARDER TO GIVE THEM- ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO PLAN FOR THE HOURS AND- DAYS TO COME. CAN ONE WERE ACTIVELY DE ENERGIZED THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHEN THEY WOULD RE ENTERPRISE. PARTICULARLY CHIANG TALENT. A CUP SUPPLIES INTO DWINDLE FOR THE VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES THE I. O. U.'S ATTEMPT AND YOU HEARD A BIT ABOUT IT TODAY TO REACH THE POPULATIONS INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS THROUGH THEIR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMER LISTS HOWEVER THESE LISTED NOT CAPTURE ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS IN FACT THEY DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR A LARGE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND WE'RE NOT THE ONES PAYING THE UTILITY BILLS. THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ATTEMPT TO REACH OUT TO MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS WAS NOT ENOUGH IN FACT WE FOUND IT TO BE INSUFFICIENT. WHEN ELECTRICITY IS OFF FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR MORE DUE TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY SHUT OFFS INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES BECOME AT RISK. HOWEVER WHEN THE SHOW OF STERN ENDED DAYS SOMETIMES WEEKS A POWER SHUT OFF CAN BECOME A LIFE. I MEAN EVENT SO HOW DID WE RESPOND WE MADE IT TO BE NIMBLE. TO WORK WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS YOU HEARD ABOUT THE MANY MANY STATE PARTNERS A CAME TOGETHER I WILL YOU KNOW PUBLICLY THANK JULIE AND HER TEAM FOR HELPING US WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY NEEDS MARKING YOUR TREAT HIM FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON. HARM AT THE SALK IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD ALL THE RESOURCE WE NEED TO BE A BILL IN THIS ATTENTIVE AS POSSIBLE AND THESE ASSETS WERE DEPLOYED IN REAL TIME TO MEETTHOSE ON MY NEEDS AS THEY CAME- OBVIOUS TO US I'M PROUD OF THE MANY NEW PARTNERSHIPS WE FOSTER TO ENSURE THAT WE FULLY LEVERAGED OUR STATE LOCAL. COMMUNITY COLLEAGUES. TO ADDRESS THE YOUNG MAN NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE. I DO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO UNDER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SITUATION STEPPED UP COLLECTIVELY. TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS WE CHECKED IN ON HAD WHAT THEY NEEDED TO STAY ALIVE. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. THE THEY COALESCED AROUND US TO ENSURE THAT TOGETHER WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REACH MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO NEEDED US THE MOST. OUR FIRST AREA FOCUS WAS THE FACILITY TO THE FACILITIES WE LICENSE WE MADE CONTACT WITH THEM. TO ENSURE THE ODDS OF SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES OF FOOD. ENERGY AND HAD NO ONE MAN AND MEDICAL NEEDS. THIS INCLUDED HEALTH FACILITIES DPH AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES LICENSED AND INCLUDED RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES AND FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY IN CHARTING KIDS IN CHILD CARE. OUR TOP PRIORITY ONCE WE REALIZE THAT THE OUTRAGE OF REACH WAS LIMITED BY THE I. O. U.'S WAS ALSO TO DO- WELFARE AND SAFETY CHECKS TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO DEPENDED ON ELECTRICALLY POWERED EQUIPMENT. TO HELP OUR COUNTY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS WE LEVERAGE OUR DATA RESOURCES INCLUDING TI US TOOLS IN MAPS ZIP CODES AND- KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE. INDIVIDUALS LIVES ACROSS THE DE ENERGIZED AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD GOOD INTEL IN- ABILITY TO MAKE CONTACT. TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAD TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO US A SUBSET OF POPULATION WHO IS MOST CONCERNING AND PERHAPS MOST AT RISK. WAS THAT GROUP SAID EXPERIENCE DE ENERGIZED ARM OR SHUT OFF FOR PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME WE OVERLY THIS INFORMATION WITH THE FEDERAL MEDICARE CLAIMS DATA ON INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WITH WHICH FURTHER NARROWED THE ZIP CODE SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THIS STATE WAS DE IDENTIFIED THAT HELPED OR PRINT PARTNERS IN THEIR- THEIR WORK WHILE MAINTAINING THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUALS ON THE LIST. TO MAKE SURE WE DID I REACH THE SUBSET OFPOPULATION. OUR DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENTS PARTNERED WITH SEVERAL LOCAL ENTITIES WHO KNEW THE AREA AND THE CLIENTS THE BEST. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WORK FULLY WITH ITS REGIONAL CENTERS TO ENSURE THAT. DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED CLIENTS ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND IN THE EVACUATED. AREAS HAD BEEN- HAD IN THEIR NEEDS MET THE DEPARTMENT OF EIGHTEEN WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AREA AGENTS AGENCIES ON AGING TO ENSURE THAT. OLDER RESIDENTS WERE CHECKED ON AND WE'RE RECEIVING NEEDED SERVICES BUT DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION WORK CLOSELY WITH THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS TO ENSURE THOSE WITH. DISABILITIES WERE CHECKED ON AND WERE RECEIVING SERVICES. THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN COLLABORATION WITH LABOR PARTNERS DEVELOP TIPS CHEATS FOR OUR AYE HSS WORKERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD A TOOL THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY HELP THEM SUPPORTER CONSUMERS DURING THESE PS PS EVENTS. THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ALSO CLOSELY WORK WITH COUNTY PARTNERS TO ENSURE WE WERE CHECKING ON ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICE CLIENTS AND ALL KIDS IN FOSTER CARE. AS THE AGENTS WE CONVENE COUNTY COLLEAGUES INCLUDING DIRECTOR FROM COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES. AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE COORDINATING AND PROVIDING ALL NECESSARY RESOURCES TO FOLKS IN THE REGION WE HAD REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH OUR ASSOCIATION PARTNERS WE PROVIDED THEM WITH DATA TO ENSURE THEY ARE TRACKING THE MOST VULNERABLE IN THE REGION'S. FINALLY WE CONVENE THE HEALTH AND TO ENSURE THEY ARE CRACKING RESPONSE. EFFORTS AND REACHING OUT TO VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS. AS YOU KNOW HEALTH PLANS- APPROVE ALL DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. THEY ARE AMONG THE MOST WELL SITUATED TO KNOW WHO HAS WHAT AND WERE THEY MIGHT LIVE SO TAPPING INTO THAT RESOURCE WAS SOMETHING WE DID IN AN AMPLE SORT OF ON THE SPOT WAY. SO JUST A MOMENT ON THE RESOURCES WE DEVELOPED WE QUICKLY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO ESTABLISH PUBLIC FACING RESOURCES WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. WE ESTABLISHED SEVERAL DIFFERENT RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT IMPACTED CALIFORNIANS HAD THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO PREPARE AND LIVE THROUGH THESE VARIOUS EVENTS. WE ESTABLISHED A NON EMERGENCY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PS PS HOTLINE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE UTILIZING THEIR EXISTING CALL CENTER. IT WAS THERE TO SUPPORT MEDICALLY VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO BE QUICKLY BECAME A TOOL FOR FACILITIES WITH QUESTIONS IT WAS OPEN NINE AM TO NINE PM THAT WAS AVAILABLE IN MANY LANGUAGES. AND WE EVEN HAD THE CAPACITY TO DO FOLLOW UP CALLS WITH PEPLE WHO CALLED IN DAY ONE OR DAY TWO WE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF CALLS OVER THE- COURSE OF THE EVENT AND CREATED ESSENTIALLY A SNOW NEW STATE RESOURCE THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED IN THE FUTURE TO HELP. RIGHT AWAY. WE DEVELOP THE CONSUMER PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF RESOURCE GUIDE ON OUR WEBSITE WHICH INCLUDED RESOURCES ACROSS ALL OF OUR ANY AGENCIES AND INCLUDED- RESOURCES AROUND CRISIS COUNSELING TO HELP INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. WE DEVELOP TO PROPOSE A PERSONAL EMERGENCY PLAN THEY CAN BE DEVELOPED TO HELP INDIVIDUALS PREPARE FOR THESE PS PS VENTS FINALLY TO HELP WITH MEDICATION NEEDS WE DEVELOPED A PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION GUIDE WE ALSO PARTNERED. WITH OUR EX OPEN TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS. WITH REAL TIME INFORMATION ON OPEN PHARMACY. SO WHAT DID E LEARN QUICKLY WE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT OUR RESPONSE CAPABILITIES AND AS I ALLUDED TO EARLIER WE EXPANDED EXISTING CAPABILITIES AND DEVELOP NEW ONES. TO MEET UNMET NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. I'D LIKE TO OFFER THREE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED SPECIFICALLY FIRST WE LEARNED WE ARE DATA RICH BUT INFORMATION POOR WE HAVE LOTS OF DATA BUT WE NEED TO MAKE THAT DATA MORE ACTIONABLE IN ORDER TO BETTER AND FORMER RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. WE MUST PULL TOGETHER VARIOUS DATA SOURCES FROM ACROSS OUR AGENCY. UP AS BETTER REFINE HOW WE DEPLOY ASSETS WHO WE DO WELFARE CHECKS ON AND HOW WE ADDRESS UNMET NEEDS. SECOND THE OUR REACH TO OUR FACILITIES MUST BE STREAMLINING COORDINATED WE ALONG WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS WERE REACHING OUT OFTEN. THIS WAS DUPLICATIVE AT TIMES RESULTING ARM CONFLICTING INFORMATION COORDINATING OUTREACH EFFORTS TO FACILITIES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE TO POINT SIMILAR SCRIPTS WHEN CALLING FACILITIES. TO CHECK ON THE STATUS WILL BE WILL BE KEY TO ENSURING THAT WE STAY TIGHTLY COORDINATED AND HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION. FINALLY AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY TODAY WE DISCOVERED THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE PARTNERSHIPS- IN VERY IN A LOT OF STRATEGIC ON IMPORTANT WAYS WE LEARN QUICKLY THAT THE ONLY WAY I CAN ENSURE. THAT THE ABILITY TO CHECK ON THEM VULNERABLE WAS BY WORKING WITH MULTIPLE STATE LOCAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. HI I WON'T TELL YOU THE MANY STORE IS WE HAVE OVER. PEOPLE AT THE STATE LEVEL COORDINATING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND COMING UP WITH A VERY NOVEL WAYS WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE CELL PHONE COVERAGE WHAT WE KNEW PEOPLE WERE EXPERIENCES AND PROLONGED SHUT OFFS. TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO VULNERABLE PEOPLE'S HOUSES TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE OKAY. IN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WERE WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD AND NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE BUILT UPON. SO I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BY THINKING THE MANY PUBLIC SERVANTS ACROSS THE STATE COUNTY YUBA GOVERNMENT CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION IN THIS RESPONSE. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE THIS OFTEN OPPORTUNITY TO THANK. THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO OPENLY STEPPED UP AND WORK WITH US TO ENSURE THE MOST VULNERABLE WERE CHECKED ON AND CARED FOR. AND THINK THE LEGISLATURE FOR TAKING AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT THIS ISSUE TODAY AND FOR YOUR ON GOING TO GARY ENGAGEMENT. THE RESILIENCE OF THE STATE IS ON MATCHED THE RESILIENCE OF INDIVIDUALS. UNDER THESE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES WERE ALSO ON MATCHED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THAT- JUST WANT TO MENTION WE HAVE SIXTEEN MORE SPEAKERS OR WAIT PRETTY FAR BEHIND. OUR OUR- SHEDULE HERE SO IF WE CAN MAYBE IN YOUR NEXT PRESENTATIONS GET TO THE MORE SALIENT POINTS IN. THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND MAYBE. THOSE AREAS SO YOU THINK ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND MOBILE NOW TO MR MENDONCA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M BLOODY MENTONE SIGN THE GOVERNOR'S CHIEF ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ADVISER AND DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE AS BEST I CAN TELL THE IMPACT OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS ON THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR BUSINESSES. IN SHORT THE IMPACT TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AS A WHOLE AS BEST WE CAN TELL FROM THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE IS LIKELY TO BE RELATIVELY SMALL. THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS SO BIG AFFECTED AREAS WERE RELATIVELY CONSTRAINED MANY LARGE BUSINESSES. ADD BACKUP POWER IN PLACE TO MITIGATE THE PS PS IMPACTS THAT'S NOT TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT BUT AN OVERALL ECONOMY. WHEN THE PUBLIC SAFETY SHUT OFF WAS ELECTED LARGELY IN. COUNTIES AND BUSINESSES THAT REFLECT ABOUT 4% OF THE STATE'S CITIZENS AND 6% OF THE GDP FOR RELATIVELY CONSTRAINED TIME PERIOD THE OVERALL IMPACT IS LIKELY TO BE SMALL. HAVING SAID THAT THERE ARE TWO AREAS OF CONCERN THAT WERE WATCHING. THE FIRST ONE IS A LONGER TERM CONCERN IF THESE CONTINUE AROUND ANXIETY FROM BUSINESSES ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THEIR POWER. AND ALSO THAT THE POWER TRYING TO SHUT US HAPPENED IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE. AT THE PEAK OF THEIR PEERS TOURISM SEASON THAT HAS SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIES OF THOSE REGIONS. SECONDLY THERE IS A DEEP CONCERN AMONG SMALL BUSINESSES ABOUT THE ONGOING RELIABILITY THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY AND OFTEN MORE THAN NOT TO NOT HAVE ANY BACK UP. POWER IN ON TOP OF THAT THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE CAPITAL THE WEATHER A LONG TERM SHUT OFF AND HAVE THE CHALLENGES OF BEING ABLE TO OPERATE. AS IT CONTINUES. MANY OF THESE SMALL BUSINESSES IMPACTED WERE WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AS WELL. OUR OFFICE WAS AB WAS ACTIVATED OR OFFICE OF SMALL BIZ ADVOCATE DURING THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF SOME WORK HAND IN HAND WITH CALLOW YES DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. DID OUT REACH TO OVER NINETY OF OUR GRANTEES ACROSS THE SMALL BUSINESS NETWORK ACROSS THE STATE. AS WELL AS STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS TO ASSESS THEIR VIEW OF WHAT THE IMPACT WAS. GENERALLY WERE HEARD FROM SOME THIS IS ON THE GROUND THAT THEY WERE NOT IN A POSITION TO ACCEPT. LOANS OR TO LOOK FOR LONG TERM CAPITAL MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT NEAR TERM RECOVERY AND REVENUES. WE ALSO HAD EARLY DISCUSSIONS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN CAPITAL PROVIDERS TO. EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOANS AND OTHER SPECTRUM OF CAPITAL AVAILABILITY SHOULD DISCONTINUE OVER TIME. AND FINALLY WE LOOKED AT PARTNERSHIPS. THAT WORK ON RESILIENCE WITH OUR GRANTEES TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS PREPARE FOR AN ONGOING OUTRAGE. LASTLY BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN AROUND LOST REVENUES WE WILL BE LAUNCHING VERY SHORTLY A VISIT CALIPHS IN COLLABORATION WITH VISIT CALIFORNIA A SHOP LOCAL AND VISIT CALIFORNIA SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN. THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT CALIFORNIA IS STILL OPEN FOR BUSINESS. PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON OUR VISITORS SERVING BUSINESSES AND ARE SMALLER BUSINESSES. THAT SHOP LOCAL INITIATIVE WILL BE WE'VE BEEN TO VISIT CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING CONTENT PLATFORMS AND WILL ALSO EXPLORE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO HIGHLIGHT. BUSINESSES IN THE STATE THAT ARE IN FACT OPEN FOR BUSINESS AND WITH THAT ALSO I'LL CONCLUDE. NOW MERRY MERRY THE JR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VERY BILL BATCHELOR I'M PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE ELIZAVETA MALASHENKO WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SECURITY AND ENFORCEMENT FOR THE PSP I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID SIR I HAVE SEVERAL PAGES BUT I'M GOING TO TRY AND EDIT AS I GO HOUSE THAT THAT'S FINE IS AT WORK OKAY- YOU'VE HEARD THE DETAIL ACCOUNTS FOR MY COLLEAGUES OF THE DISRUPTIONS AND CHALLENGES CALLED CAUSED BY THE PS PS EVENTS. AND WILD FIRES ON THE RESIDENTS AND FOR THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO I WILL TRY NOT TO RETREAD THAT TERRITORY I THINK ALSO IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS IT'S BEEN MADE VERY CLEAR BUT I STATEMENTS THAT I'VE MADE AT DIFFERENT- FORUMS THAT THE P. USED HELD THAT- BEERS THE PS PS WAS NOT WELL CARRIED OUT IN PARTICULAR BY- ONE OF THE I AO USE AND THAT IS P. JEANNIE SO I WILL NOT AGAIN. GO THROUGH OF THOSE DETAILS I DID SPEND CONSIDERABLE TIME AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WITH MY DEAR COLUMNS DURING THE LAST WEEK OF OCTOBER AND WITNESS THE MOBILIZATION IN REAL TIME PROBLEM BUILDING FROM THE LEADING LEVEL TO THOSE MAKING REAL DIFFERENCE ON THE GROUND AND IN THE COMMUNITIES. IS A WORLD CLASS EMERGENCY RESPONSE BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER I DO NOT WANT WAY FROM THESE EVENTS WHICH WHICH US THE IS POSITIVE IMPRESSIONS I WAS ALSO PROVIDE WAS INSIDE THE HOW A TOOL LIKE PS PS INTENT PROTECT PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES FROM ARM CAN WIN IN HAPHAZARDLY. AT THE FACT I HAVE GAINED SHARPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE OF ONE ENTITY CAN RESULT IN BURKE SOCIETY COSTS THE TEST BEFORE ALL OF IT NOW PARTICULAR THE CPUC IS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUTURE USE OF PSP IS INITIATED AN EXECUTED IN A MANNER THAT CONSIDERS AND IN THE BEST. INTEREST OF ALL IMPACTED BY IT. EVER STOP DEMANDING BETTER WAYS TO REDUCE THE RISK AND TO REDUCE THE USE SCOPE AND IMPACTS OF A POWER SHUT OFF WITHOUT COMPROMISING PUBLIC SAFETY. WE SAW PLAY OUT IN I OWE YOU SERVICE TERRITORIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE LAST LAST MONTH CANNOT AS IT'S BEEN STATED AND SHOULD NOT BE REPEATED. I'VE ONLY BEEN AT THE CPUC FOR THREE MONTHS BUT IT IT IT DOES NOT TAKE LONG TO SEE THE PRIVILEGE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE IN BEING A UNIQUE PROVIDER OF ESSENTIAL SERVICE. PUBLIC IT IS ALL IT ALSO HAS NOT TAKEN ME LONG TO REALIZE HOW SOME UTILITIES FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A PRIVILEGE IT IS AND THAT SUCH A PRIVILEGE COMES WITH GREAT RESPONSIBILITY TO THOSE THEY SERVE. IT IS A C. B. U. PC'S THE CPU SEES RESPONSIBILITY THEREFORE TO IDENTIFY AND CORRECT SUCH FAILURES WE MUST ENSURE ANY FUTURE POWER SHUT OFF THE VENT. IS NOTHING LIKE THE PLAYED OUT IN THE P. JEANNIE IN PARTICULAR AND IN PARTS OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SERVICE TERRITORIES LAST MONTH. AS YOU I WILL SKIP- OUR OUR HISTORY OF THE P. C. P. SKEWS ME OF THE- S. P. S. BECAUSE I THINK THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OUTLINED THAT FOR YOU AND IT'S IN THEIR HANDS AND OUT SO FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I WILL SAY THAT HISTORY. THE UTILITIES PLANS FOR THESE EVENTS HOWEVER ONLY EFFECTIVE WHEN THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED IN A REASONABLE AND COMPETENT MANNER. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN ACROSS ALL SERVICE TERRITORIES LAST MONTH AS I SAID. THE IMPACT AND SCOPE OF THE POWER SHUT OFF TO LIVES BUSINESS AND ECONOMY CANNOT BE OVERSTATED AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID PGA. IN P. G. I IN PARTICULAR NOT FULLY PREPARED TO MANAGE SUCH A LARGE SCALE POWER SHUT UP THROUGHOUT THE RUPIAH'S PS EVENTS AS HAS BEEN WELL STATED P. JEANNIE HAD MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH COMMUNICATIONS COORDINATION. AND VENT AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. AMONG VARIOUS PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED WE WITNESS FIJIAN NOT HAD ADEQUATELY PREPARED OR OR HAD PREPARED FOR THE SCALE OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS FOR INCREASING CUSTOMERS CONTACTING THE UTILITY DURING THE SHUT OFF EVENTS. AS WELL STATED BY SECRETARY LEE. WE HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM THE LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ON THE LACK OF COORDINATION UNTIL THE POWERSHOT UPS COMMENCED THE LACK OF CRITICAL INFORMATION FLOW IN SOME INSTANCES BREAKDOWNS INCOMPLETE QUOTE COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND I WILL ADD THAT THAT WAS TRUE INDEED EVEN IN A LAST PSE EVENT ALTHOUGH OTHER THINGS HAD BEEN IMPROVED UPON. AN EXECUTION COME WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE EVENTS CREATED AN ACCEPTANCE BOTH SITUATIONS THAT SHOULD NEVER BE REPEAT AS I'VE STATED AND THAT REQUIRES SCRUTINY IN CORRECTION WELL P. JEANNIE SPENT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES WORK IN THE PUBLIC. ABOUT THE RISKS OF THE POWER SHUT UP THE VENTS AND WHAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD DO TO PREPARE FOR AN EVENT. IT IS NOT CLEAR THE P. JEANNIE SPENT THE TIME IT SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE UTILITY. ITSELF WAS PREPARED. THESE ARE THE RECENT ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THESE EVENTS THE CPUC IS TAKEN IMMEDIATE ACTION TO HOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY. ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH WE HELD AN EMERGENCY MEETING TO HEAR FROM THE TOP P. JEANNIE EXECUTIVES ABOUT LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS. OF THE WEEK OF OCTOBER SEVENTH AND TO ADDRESS THE STEPS. THAT THE UTILITY WOULD TAKE TO ENSURE MISTAKES AND OPERATIONAL GAPS WOULD NOT BE REPEATED. THE CPUC SAFETY IN AND SPENT THE VISION IS THEREFORE CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN P. S. P. S. EVENTS TO EVALUATE THE NATURE. OF THE LACK OF PREPAREDNESS I'M NOT ONLY P. GINNY BUT ALSO OF THE STATE'S OTHER I- USE. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL ASSESS WHETHER THE STATE'S INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES PROPERLY BALANCED THE NEED TO PROVIDE SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE WHEN PLANNING AND EXECUTING THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS. THEIMMEDIATE FIRST STEP IN THE PRECEDING IS FOR OUR SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT DIVISION TO OVERSEE AN EVALUATION OF THE UTILITIES ACTIONS TO DURING AND AFTER. THE PS PS EVENTS. EVALUATION INCLUDE THE QUALITY OF THE UTILITIES INTERNAL COMMUNE CORPORATION SITUATIONAL AWARENESS EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS AND PRE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF THE PS ECEVIT'S THE RESULTS WERE PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC IN A REPORT. THIS PROCEEDING IS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW. OF BOTH THE AFFECT NEST AND IMPACTS OF ALL PHASES OF THE RECENT PS PS EVENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER FURTHER CHANGES TO EXISTING PS YES REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS. ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY. IT MAY RESULT IN AN ENFORCEMENT FACE TO ADDRESS FINDINGS OF NON COMPLIANCE WITH C. D. UC RULES AND REGULATIONS. ADDITIONALLY ON OF OUR TWELFTH DIRECTED PIGEON TO DEMONSTRATE WHY IT SHOULDN'T BE SANCTIONED FOR XPS IT PS EVENTS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN. THE ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WILL PROVIDE FOR A. TIONAL TESTIMONY COMMENTS AND OR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE IMPACTED PARTIES INCLUDING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. THE PARTIES WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO RIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MONETARY FINES AND ANY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AS APPROPRIATE. WE ARE HOLDING A PRE HEARING CONFERENCE ON THIS ISSUE ON DECEMBER FOURTH. THE ISLEY ORDERED P. G. NEED TO PERFORM AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW OF THESE PSP PS EVENTS AND FILE WEEKLY UPDATES ON CORRECTIVE ACTIONS UNTIL ALL CONCERNS HAVE INDEED BEEN ADDRESSED THE DIRECTIVE ALSO STANDS. AS A RESULT OF THESE RECENT EVENTS WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS REVISING PHASE TWO OF THE PS PS PROCEEDINGS IN ORDER TO REVIEW THE PS PS GUIDELINES ADOPTED IN PHASE ONE AND TO ACCELERATE CONSIDERATION OF YOU LADY. INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE PS PS. WE ARE ALSO DIRECTING THE UTILITIES TO EXPAND THEIR UP COMING UP COMING WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS TO FOCUS% CREASING THEIR SAFETY PERFORMANCE AND CREATING MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR PSP S. EVENTS BEFORE THE NEXT WILDFIRE SEASON. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UTILITY CUSTOMERS ARE BEING TREATED FAIRLY BY THEIR UTILITIES CUSTOMERS SHOULD NOT PAY FOR SERVICES THEY DID NOT RECEIVE. AS SUCH WE WILL WORK TOWARDS ENSURING CUSTOMERS ARE NOT CHARGE FOR SERVICES THEY DID NOT RECEIVE DURING THE PS PS EVENTS. AS WE REFLECT ON THE PSP OBSERVANCE IN THE WILD FIRES WE ALSO KNOW THAT THESE EVENTS LED TO FAILURES IN THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AS DIRECTOR GALA DUDE SHE MENTIONED MOMENTS AGO WE CANNOT FORGET THE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE DURING SUCH TURBULENT TIMES IS CRITICAL AND FAILURES IN THE SYSTEM ALSO IN DANGER LIVES. CALIFORNIANS AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS RELY ON THEIR PHONES AND THEIR INTERNET WHETHER IT BE A WATER LINE REQUIRE LESS TECHNOLOGY TO RECEIVE AND SEND EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION. WE WHAT WE LEARNED SENSE THEN IS THAT FAILURES IN THE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS OCCURRED ON A SIGNIFICANT SCALE AS WAS OUTLINED BY DIRECTORGALA DUTY. THIS IS PROMPTED ME TO HOLD A PRE HEARING CONFERENCE ON NOVEMBER TWENTIETH TWO QUESTION THE COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ON THEIR EFFORTS TO KEEP THE SYSTEMS FUNCTIONING DURING THE OCTOBER PS PS EVENTS. PRE HEARING CONFERENCE WILL IN FOR THE SCOPE AND SCHEDULE FOR THE PRECEDING WHICH WILL ESTABLISH RULES FOCUSED ON BUILDING A RESILIENT COMMUNICATION NETWORK FOR FUNCTIONALITY DURING EMERGENCIES THE TOPICS INCLUDE. REQUIREMENT OF A BACKUP BATTERY POWER AND GENERATORS AT CELLULAR TOWERS AND HARDENING OF THE COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER CONVENIENCE SEVERAL FORMS OVER THE LAST YEAR TO PROVE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE COMMUNICATION COMPANIES AND THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES WE HAVEN'T CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS A LACK OF UNIFORM AND STRUCTURED APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS. ARE DRESSING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO PROVIDE SAFE AND ROLL UP RELIABLE SERVICE DURING THESE EMERGENCY EVENTS THIS LACK OF PREPARATION AND TRANSPARENCY HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES DURING THE MOST. RECENT PSP IS EVENTS AND WILDFIRES AS AGAIN MY COLLEAGUE MISTER GELLER DUTY MENTIONED THERE WERE WIDESPREAD REPORTS OF COMMUNICATION OUTAGES ACROSS ALL SECTORS MOBILE NETWORKS. WILL BE IP COMMUNICATIONS AND THE INNER. AS WE WERE TOWARD TO FIND PATHWAYS IF AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO FIND WAYS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PS PS EVENTS WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THE COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS MUST ALSO BE A PART OF THE DISCUSSION AND SOLUTIONS. AS WE ARE TAKING REGULATORY ACT AND ALL. THE TO HOLDING ALL UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE WE'RE ALSO LOOKING INTERNALLY. WITHIN THE P. YOU SEE TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND OUTCOMES ON THE GROUND AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE WE ARE MAKING IS TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN OF A NEW SAFETY POLICY DIVISION. TO CONTINUE TO MAKE A TANGIBLE DOUBLE THE PROGRESS IN SAFETY THE CPUC WILL COMMIT THE RESOURCES TO DEVELOP A SAFETY POLICY AS IT DOES ON OTHER POLICY MATTERS. HE SAID TO POLICY DIVISION WILL ENSURE THAT THERE IS DEDICATED STAFF TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING SAFETY REGULATIONS POSED IMPROVEMENTS AND WORK ON EMERGING EMERGING ISSUES SUCH AS SAFETY CULTURE. IN CLOSING WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE MONEY BY EXPRESSING MY APPRECIATION TO OF COURSE THE PRO TEM ATKINS AND TO YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND TO THE SENATORS IN ATTENDANCE TODAY FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND HAVING ENGAGED IN THE RECENT WEEKS DURING THESE EVENTS IN THE DAYS WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND LAST MONTH'S EVENTS EXAMINE LAST MONTH'S EVENTS AND MONITOR HOW WELL COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE OHIO USE AND THE RECALL CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS THE CPUC HAS IDENTIFIED RE INDEED IMPLEMENTED. HOWEVER DESPITE IMPORTANCE OF THE REGULATORY PROCESSES AND THE ACTIONS WE HAVE BEEN IN MOTION THEY ARE MEANINGLESS TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS THEY TRACK PLAYED INTO REAL WORLD DEMONSTRATIONS THAT UTILITIES TRULY TAKING ACTIONS THAT PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC THAT THEY SERVE IT IS CLEAR TO THE MEMBERS ALLEGED IT IS CLEAR THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SHARE THIS INTENT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO READ. WHY IS IT THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK YOU DID GET TO THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS AND REPORTING THOSE AND REGARDING. THE COMPENSATION THAT WE'VE HAD TODAY WITH ALL THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT PRESENTERS- THE P. UC'S SEEMS TO BE KIND OF THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT THE FOCAL POINT. OF ANYTHING HAPPENING IN WITH. OR ANYTHING THAT IN THE MIX REGARDING. OUR OUR NEXT STEPS AND YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE. CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION BUT ALSO COME UP WITH A- PLAN- REGARDING THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES IN THAT ONE TRACK AND THEN YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. THIS P. AT PS PS IMPLEMENTATION GLOCK PLANS ARE FRAMEWORK FOR A POLICY AND HOW THOSE. HAPPENED PRECEDING THAT IS ON GOING ON GOING AND IT'S GOING TO BE GOING ON I IMAGINE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TIME FRAME FOR EITHER OF THESE AS BUT I DID WANT TO ASK WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME DO YOU EXPECT. THAT YOU'LL NOT ONLY FINISH BY BEFORE NEXT YEAR'S OF. FIRE SEASON YES THAT IS OUR INTENT ON ALL OF THE THINGS I MENTIONED THE FOUR OR FIVE THINGS THAT I MENTIONED THAT ARE UNDER WAY IN THE LAST. THIRTY DAYS. AND ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE UTILITIES THAT PRESENTED TODAY TALKED ABOUT AMENDING THEIR- PHONE. WELL GOALS IN TERMS OF HOW THE HEART IN THE GRID MAKE THE GRADE MORE RESILIENT ALL OF A MENTION THAT THEY HAVE TO REACH OUT TO THE PC PRESENT THEIR PLANS APPROVED THE PLANS FOR YOU SEE IMAGINE. THAT'S GOING TO BE A CONCURRENT. ROSS SAYS SAYS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS THEY'RE GOING TO BE PRESENTING THEIR PLANS- P. GINNY MENTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE. THEIR SUBMITTAL IN JANUARY I HEARD THAT SO AS TO WHAT FIRE MITIGATION PLAN SIR YES YES THAT WILL BE GOING ON CONCURRENTLY MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THEY MENTIONED THE HARD NEED THAT BOTH- ALL THREE ACTUALLY I USE MENTIONED TODAY I THINK YOU. TOOK PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO- THOSE THINGS MIGHT MENTION BY SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE MENTIONED BY THE BIO USE WITHIN THEIR WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AND WE WILL BE. TAKING WITH THEM TO UPDATE THEM AS I JUST SAID. TO FOCUS GREATER FOCUS ON SAFETY WHICH IS ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE WELFARE MEDICATION.

OF WE ARE- WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RIGHT NOW- WE DID RECEIVE- BUDGET- AN APPROPRIATION- WE ARE WORKING IN JULY ONE ON TO ADD TO OUR RESOURCES BOTH IN A LITTLE BIT IS AREA AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING THE NEW WILD FIRE SAFETY DIVISION. AND THOSE RESOURCE AND WE'RE INDEED YOU SEE THAT STORY TO UNDERSTAND THOSE POSITIONS UP NOW. AND WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN IN FURTHERING OUR RESOURCE NEEDS I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE CRITICAL IN THIS NEXT YEAR AND- IN WRAPPING UP THIS ENTIRE PROCESS IS WANT TO MAKESURE THAT YOU DO HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY. I APPRECIATE THAT ACCOMPLISHED AT AND MAKE SURE WE GET TO OUR GOALS THAT WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE- SENATOR SKINNER THAN. SEPTEMBER OF MORE LOCKED AND SENATOR. NIELSEN. ALL WHILE OKAY EVERYONE- THANK YOU AND THEN MCGUIRE THAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. AS STATE OFFICIALS FOR YOUR PRESENT SOMEONE AT- A MISTER UNCONSCIOUS THANK YOU FOR. THE REFERENCE TO WELL WE DIDN'T EXPERIENCE STATEWIDE BECAME. OUR BUSINESSES REALLY WANT CERTAINTY. THIS THIS CREATES THAT WORST CASE FOR BUSINESSES WHERE THEY CAN'T PLANTS APPRECIATE THAT YOU MENTION THAT. AND I WANT TO. THANK MISTER ALI FOR. THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT YOUR DIVISION DEALS WITH SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN BE MOST IMPACTED BY SUCH OUTAGES IN GLAD THE STATE HAS BEEN- I THINK MY EXPERIENCE SO FAR VERY MUCH ON TOP OF THAT. IT'S REALLY HARD TO DO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY RESIDENTS AFFECTED BY ANY PARTY TO. THE MISTER THE CHAIR WOULD. SAY THE D. AS DURING THE. OUTAGE SOME OF MY DISTRICT IS AFFECTED BY THE OUTAGES AND AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD A REFINERY- DEPOT FIRE WITH AYE ET CLOSE FROM BOTH SIDES AND THEN WE HAD A SECOND FIRE. IN CERTAIN VALLEJO THAT JUMPED TO THE DISTRICT IN COULD OF PUT A REFINERY IN FIVE TIMES HIGHER IN INTERESTINGLY IN BOTH IN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES BOTH THE POWER OUTAGES. THE MORE MORE SPECIFIC IN SMALLER FIRES THAT HIT JUST MY DISTRICT- I EXPERIENCED THIS VERY DIFFERENT SO DURING THE PS PS THERE WAS MOSTLY. THE COMMUNICATION THROUGH P. JEANNIE. BUT THEY ALSO ARE DIVISION OF OUR GOVERNOR OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WHERE MY STAFF AND I COULD CALL IN. AND BE. THERE WERE GOODS AND BADS BUT IF I THEN CONTRASTED TO THE- THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE REFINERY FIRES WHERE WE HAVE A CLEARER AND I DON'T MEAN THIS JUST FOR THE STATE BUT I'M RATHER. I'M COMPARING IT TO THE YES PS IN THAT WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR PROTOCOL WHERE IT GOES THROUGH THE COUNTY OFFICES AND THERE'S A CLEAR HIERARCHY AND MY STAFF KNOW IT THEY KNOW WHO AS DETERMINATION DETERMINE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER THERE'S EVACUATION WHETHER THERE'S ALL TERM PLACE WHETHER THERE'S YOU KNOW THE QUICK. THE QUICK SETTING UP OF CENTERS FOR PEOPLE TO BE IN AND ALL THAT AND ALL OF THAT WORKED FOR MORE SMOOTHLY PS PS THIS IS NOT I'M NOT DIRECTING THIS AT THE STATE SO MUCH BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE. DIFFERENT DIVISIONS I HAD TO REACT WITH. THE PS PS ON THE STATE SIDE I FOUND I WAS QUITE SATISFACTORY BUT WHAT I'M REALLY POINTING OUT IS THAT THAT KIND OF DIFFERENTIATION WHERE THERE WAS A CLEAR. PROTOCOL AND CLEAR HIERARCHY. IN THE IN THOSE HAZARDS CIRCUMSTANCES IT THE COMMUNICATION WAS SO MUCH BETTER THE RESIDENTS WERE BETTER SERVED. AND WHATEVER WE CAN DO MAKE THE PS PS EXPERIENCE MORE ANALOGOUS I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND THEN FINALLY MY QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE TO OUR SI PC PRESIDENT APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THAT YOU'RE HERE. TWO THINGS FIRST WHAT DOES SHE HAVE ANY KIND OF ESTIMATE OF WHAT IT COSTS IN ANY OF OUR I USE TO DO THESE POWER OUTAGES NOW OBVIOUSLY IT'S A IF IT'S- A MORE RESIDENTS YOU KNOW P. GENIES WOULD SEEM TO ME. OBVIOUSLY MORE COSTLY THAN ESTY GENIES OR STDS BUT DO YOU REQUEST IN THE TO IN THE REPORT TO GET LATER. YOU ASK FOR A COST BREAKDOWN. I HAVE NINE IN IN THE QUESTION. THEM NOW THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE CAN'T IN THE FUTURE BUT THE THINGS THAT I HAVE DONE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY DAYS OR SO BEING HERE I HAVEN'T BUT I THINK THAT IN THE PROCEEDINGS WE WILL GET A CALL. DOWN SETTING WOULD BE HELPFUL FIRST NOTICE HOW COSTLY IT IS BECAUSE THAT. HELP US WELL ANYWAY WOULD JUST BE USEFUL. THE OTHER- IS YOU MENTIONED THE DIFFERENT BUDGET FORTIES THAT WE GAVE SPACE THERE WITH MY CAR- HAD TO LEAVE EARLY HAD ASKED SPECIFICALLY- EITHER THE P. YOU SEE HAD BEEN ABLE TO HIRE OR ANY OF THE EIGHT F. E. THAT WERE GIVEN FOR. THAT SPECIFICALLY FOR PS PS OVERSIGHT- YES ENTER SKINNER I LOOKED UP. ON I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT THAT NUMBER EIGHT AHA THAT CAME FROM A SPRING LETTER. THAT WAS SUBMITTED AND ACTUALLY SEVERAL SEVERAL THINGS THAT WERE REQUEST THAT THE I'M MORE COMBINED. TO AS I SAID EIGHT EIGHT AND A DIRECT APPROPRIATION OF FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TOOK CARE. IN SEPARATION. MISSIONS AND SOME OTHER POSITION. ALSO THERE IS THAT WERE COMBINED FROM- TEN FIFTY FOUR. IT. MASON WAS IN I THINK ONE ELEVEN AND- IT WAS A COMBINED APPROPRIATIONS YOUR MAKING PRO ASSIGNED WE ARE INDEED AND WE WILL MAKE MORE IN THE UPCOMING BUDGET. EXCELLENT AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION AND- I DON'T. I DON'T LIKE TO MICROMANAGE OUR ROOM THREE AGENCIES YOU ALL NEED TO BUT I JUST WONDERED. BECAUSE IN ASKING THE DIFFERENT FIRE USE ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAD EITHER MANDATED TO IMPLEMENT BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES OR WHETHER THEY ENTER TO INCLUDE SUCH AN EVALUATION AND ANY OF THEIR PLANS- THE ANSWERS THAT. I GOT FROM WHICH WOULD STAY HADN'T BUT ES DE GENIE FOR EXAMPLE DID IT ON THEIR OWN. AND IN PGP INDICATED THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT NOW BUT I WONDERED SINCE IT'S. TIVOLI COMMON FOR OUR AND REGULATORY AGENCIES TO DIRECT THAT FROM THE ENTITIES THAT THEY REGULATE IS THAT SOMETHING THE P. HOUSTON MIGHT CONSIDER LOOKING OUT. THE DOOR DIRECTED- TWO HI SAFE AND RELIABLE ENERGY THEY ARE DIRECTED TO DO THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN IN RECENT LEGISLATION DIRECT FURTHER DIRECTION SUCH AS IN. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR SO THERE IS DIRECTION THAT IS GIVEN TO THEM IN DIFFERENT PROCEEDINGS AND YOU THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ALSO DIRECTED US TO DIRECT THEM SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS OF ACTIONS YES SO I WOULD SAY I THINK THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A VERY SPECIFIC CHEF I CAN RECALL THE TESTIMONY BUT WILL DEFINITELY. TEN FIFTY FOUR AS AND I AM ONLY I'M ONLY. I SUPPOSE SEATED ON IT A BIT AS- WHEN I HEAR FROM OR ARE YOU U. pP. JEANNIE THAT THEY FEEL THEY MAY NEED TEN YEARS I GUESS THAT FOR THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT THAT SURGERY IT'S VERY SCARY TO CONSIDER THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THAT TEN YEARS AND CLEARLY WE KNOW THAT. CERTAIN CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES OR HARDENING AND RESILIENCY TYPE OF- APPROACHES ARE BOTH FASTER TO IMPLEMENT AND LESS EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT AND SO I'M I'M I'M THINKING AND- I WOULD NOT MANDATE IT TO YOU ALL BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO AND WHETHER IN FACT THE BEST APPROACH. BUT IF THERE ARE ONES THAT ARE AFFECTED AND FAST NOT AS EXPENSIVE THEN THE SOONER WE CAN MOVE ON AND IT LEAST IT TEAMS WOULD BE VERY LARGE CALL. GREAT AND I THINK THAT- SOME OF THE TESTIMONY. TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION SHARING- I THINK SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC HAD SAID THAT THEY NOT ONLY DO THEY SHARE INFORMATION WITH P. GENE IN PARTICULAR BUT THEY LOOK TOWARD. BOTH P. JEANNIE IN SOCAL EDISON TO LEARN THINGS AS WELL AND I WOULD URGE MORE OF THAT. GREAT CAN THERE'S MANY MORE THINGS I'D LOVE TO ASK BUT MY COLLEAGUES BEACON I DO HAVE TO LEAVE SO MY LAST QUESTION WOULD BE TO. TO MISTER TAYLOR DUTY. DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT- YES WAS GIVEN TO HELP COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS PREPARE FOR THESE POWER OUTAGES HAS SPENT. THERE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SPENT BUT I COULD TELL YOU HOW MUCH HAS BEEN ALLOCATED- SO. THE. IT WAS THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WAS SHARED AMONGST. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WE'VE ALLOCATED- TWENTY SIX MILLION OF THAT TOO- COUNTIES- BUT THE FOLLOWING BREAKDOWN- WAS A- BASE WAS POPULATION. GRANT AND- THE GRAND IF YOU'RE A COUNTY THAT HAS NOT EXPERIENCED A P. S. P. S. ARE YOU GET A BASED A GRANT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. YOUR COUNTY THEY HAD- HAD EXPERIENCE PHP ASENATH POPULATION OF LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND- YOU GOT THE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT. AND THEN IF YOU'RE A COUNTY HAD A POPULATION OF MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND THAT HAPPENS EXPERIENCED. YES YES. IT WAS A BASED A PLUS FOR THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT. AND THEN WE SEPARATED TIONAL TEN POINT THREE MILLION- OUR BASE WAS POPULATION TO ALL THE REMAINING- IS IN THE STATE'S THE CABLE SOME CAPACITY. WE ALSO- ALLOCATED TEN MILLION FOR CITIES. I'M AND- ONE BAG OF SEE ALL THE MONEY FOR COUNTIES HAS BEEN ALLOCATED- TEN MAIN CITIES- INCLUDED- ALLOCATION TO- THE STATE'S MOST POPULOUS. CITY THE THEY HAVE HAD PS PS OF ALL ABILITIES. DIRECT ALLEGATIONS WERE SAN JOSE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO IN OAKLAND. HE'S GOT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND THEN ALL THE UP CITIES OUGHT TO DO A- A COMPETE. FIND OF- BOB I WAS A STREAMLINED PROCESS THAT WE PUT IN THESE. CITIES REQUIRED OUTLINED HOW THEY'LL TEND TO USE THE FUNDS AND- THAT THAT IS BASED ON SOME INFORMATION. POPULATION DAYS OF P. S. P. S. EXPERIENCE- EXTRA AND THEN LASTLY- TRIBES WERE- ALLOCATED. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ALSO ON. THIS COMMUNITY CENTERS HEALTH FACILITIES AND FACILITIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO COMMUNITIES FUNCTIONS DURING ONE OF THESE A POWER INTERRUPTIONS ALSO ONE TIME COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IDENTIFYING ANY QUICK. RESOURCE CENTERS FOR PUBLIC ACCESS DURING ELECTRICAL DISTRICT DISRUPTIONS- AS WELL BACKUP OF EMERGENCY COMMUNITY THE QUICK MESSAGES BATTERY POWERED RADIOS- AND THEN PUBLIC EDUCATION MATERIALS OR SUPPLIES FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL- AND FAMILY PREPAREDNESS LOGICAL- POWERSHOT OFFICE. ALSO DEVELOPMENT AN UPDATE OF CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR ELECTRICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF A CLOSE CONSIDERATION SUCH AS PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS WITH AXES AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS MEDICAL BASS LINES SOCIAL MARBLE POPULATIONS. TRANSPORTATION ADVOCACY PUBLIC INFORMATION AND PRESERVATION OF SUCH FUNCTIONS. AS WELL DEVELOPMENT AN UPDATE OF THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS PLANNED FOR JURISDICTION BY JURISDICTION. AND THEN RISK ASSESSMENT FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LIFELINES AND THEN POST EVENT REPORTS THAT IDENTIFY LESSONS LEARNED TO INFORM CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENTS SO IS A VERY BROAD. SET UP OF ELIGIBILITY IS THAT WE TRY TO PROVIDE UP FOR THIS EDITION STREAMLINED FUNDING ALLOCATION- THAT WENT OUT A WHAT IS NOT ELIGIBLE IS THE COST THE RESPONSE COSTS ASSOCIATED. SO SHE DID WITH A LARGE TRUCK BEDS- LIKE- RESPONDING TO YOUR BURDENS THE OPERATIONS CENTER STAFFING. SECURITY FIRE SERVICE ETCETERA. ONE TWELVE AND THEY EVEN WENT DOOR TO DOOR TO SOME OF THE MIRACLE BASELINE BECAUSE- THEY SET UP THEIR OWN CENTERS FOR PEOPLE TO GO NOT JUST TO CHARGE THINGS BUT TO BASICALLY. BE YOU KNOW. JUST AND- ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO DIDN'T EVEN HAVE CELL PHONE SERVICE SO- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT NAY NOAM NUMBER MY COMMUNITIES UTILIZE THE MONEY VERY WELL UNDER MORE LUCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- NOW THAT I HAVE THE STORE WHEN I GO THROUGH A RISK MANAGEMENT ACT. HI IS. YOU HAVE BY- YOU HAVE INVERSE CONDEMNATION OF THEIR WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING THAT THEY START THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGES. C. A. B. TEN FIFTY FOUR AND IT'S NEW AND IT ISN'T REALLY FULLY FUNDED SO THEY DON'T HAVE THAT AS A BACKSTOP. THEY'RE READY HAVE MASSIVE RELEASE IN THE CASE OF ONE MASSIVE BODIES FOR PAST FIRES AND NOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT VERY HIGH INSURANCE PREMIUM COSTS. SO WHAT BUT WHAT OTHER CHOICE DO THEY HAVE BESIDES A P. S. P. S. IF I MAY CENTER I THINK WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT I- USE- WITH THE SAME REGULATORY SCHEME YOU SEE REALLY DIFFERENT. BY ALL THREE I USE BOTH IN TERMS OF THE STATIONS UP UNTIL THIS POINT AND RELATIVE INVESTMENTS IN. IN HARDENING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS THE POSITION MAKING PROCESS IN IN THROUGH THESE EVENTS AND YOU SAW CHANGES IN THE USE OF THESE EVENTS OVER TIME SO IF YOU LOOK AT SANDY- GAS AND ELECTRIC. THEY HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN- IN WEATHER DATA AND WEATHER INFORMATION TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF- OF WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT SANTA WINDS ARE GOING TO BE DOING. THAT ARE USING THAT TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR DECISION MAKING THEY HAVE A STATE OF THE ART YOU'LL SEE THAT THEY ARE ALL THAT THEY ARE OPERATING TO MAKE REAL TIME DECISIONS. THEY ALSO HAVE HARD THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE LOOKED AT AREAS IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE A HIGHER LEVEL OF RISK AND- AND THE LOOK AT SOME SOLUTIONS. FOR HOW TO DO BE A BIKE RATES ARE MANY GROUPS OR OTHER APPROACHES FOR HOW THEY DEAL WITH THOSE BUT WHEN WE BUT THEY STILL TURNED OFF THEIR POWERS ALL THREE OF THEM USE PS PS IN A MUCH. BROADER WAY FOR SHORTER PERIODS OF TIME AFFECTING MUCH SMALLER ENTITIES- SO LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT THE EDISON EXPERIENCE THIS YEAR. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE EDISON. THE POTENTIAL OF PSP S. AND THE RELATIVE AMOUNT OF- CUSTOMERS WHO WERE TURNED WHERE ARE WAS TURNED OFF- AS WELL AS YOU LOOK AT THE DURATION OF THOSE OUTAGES IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE PGA ANY SERVICE TOWARD TERRITORY WE LOOK AT ALL THREE UTILITIES. THE USE OF PSP A TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE EVENT THE DURATION OF THE OUTAGES THE BACK TO COLLEGES IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY FOR THE OTHER TWO UTILITIES AND THEY'RE ALL OPERATING ON THE SAME REGULATORY REGIME. SO WE WOULD AGREE WITH MISS BACK SURE THAT. BECAUSE NO ONE IS SAID DON'T USE PSP AS I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT TODAY BUT- WHEN YOU DO IT- WE SAW- MAYBE TO PARAPHRASE MS BOETTCHER- IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTION. LACK OF PREPAREDNESS RESOLVE WE SAW. A VERY DISAPPOINTING. EXECUTION AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ROOM SO. WHEN THAT THE NOW YOUR NEW PAIR IF I CAN ASK YOU A QUESTION- DID THE CPUC GIVE ALL THREE UTILITIES. A NERVE. RATE INCREASES THE PAY FOR NOT ONLY THE HARPING OF ASSETS. ALSO FOR THE ABILITY TO PURSUE RENEWABLE ENERGY ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY WERE ASKED TO BUILD THE DO WE GIVE THEM ENOUGH ROOM. WELL I AS I SAID I'VE BEEN THERE SINCE AUGUST SIXTEENTH SO I HAVEN'T BEEN AWARE OF ALL PROCEEDINGS BEFORE US BUT I WOULD GENERALLY SAY YES WE THEY COME BEFORE US. AT WITH RATE CASES AND- THERE'S A THEY PROCESS THAT WE USE. IN THE PROCEEDINGS WITH. A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH THE WITH THE PUBLIC IN PUBLIC ADVOCATES. AND THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SO FORTH THAT COME THEIR CUSTOMERS- AND COME THROUGH THAT PROCEEDINGS WITH SOMETHING THAT IS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE. I DON'T KNOW IF MY COLLEAGUES LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING LESE A TO THE- ORGAN. SO THEN LAST QUESTION OF MISTER GELLER DO G. WE JUST APPROVED THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. A NEW FEET PER CELL PHONES TO MAKE SURE THAT NINE ONE ONE WOULD BE. THERE AND IT NEXT GEN IS IT IS IT NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE IT'S THAT INTERNET BASED. YES IT IS SO ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO RELY ON. ITS MESSAGE WE VISIT MISS BECHER'S RECOMMENDATION HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS IN. OTHERWISE HOW DOES YOUR SYSTEM THREE OUT OF IT IT IS IT'S A IT'S A REDUNDANCY IN THE SYSTEM- THAT IS B. AS MICROWAVE AND INTERNET BASED STATE BECAUSE THIS DATA AND VOICE AND LOOK AT WORK THESE THESE THESE DEVICES ARE CURRENTLY VOICE AND- SLOWLY MOVING OFF OF VOICE AND EVERYTHING'S GOING TO DATA. THAT'S THE VOICE OVER IP PROTOCOL TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE SYSTEM THAT BAD AS A TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD BE AS A SOCIETY ARE BEING PUSHED INTO WE HAVE NO DIRECT CONTROL OVER THAT TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT IS PRIVATELY OWNED AND PRIVATELY MANAGED WHAT WE HAVE IS WE'VE GOT THE WORKING END OF IT RIGHT TOWARD THE POINTY END OF THE SPEAR I UTILIZE IT. BUT WILL HAVE A SH PRINCES BUT WHEN WE UTILIZE THIS DEVICE THIS LIFESAVING CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONSDEVICE IT HAS RESILIENCY. BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH I WOULD ALSO ARGUE EXIST IN HURRICANE PRONE STATE IN FLOODING PRONE STATE WARREN CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE. ALL SORTS OF KIND OF DISASTERS DIGEST THIS IS THE WAY IT IS BEEN THAT WAY SINCE THE LESSONS WE- WE MADE EIGHT. AND THE FACT IS THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS WE NEED TO HAVE ASSURANCE THAT THE SYSTEM IS RESILIENT THAT MEANS THAT THE CELL SITES. ARE HEARTENED THAT THEY HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND WHILE FIRE THEY'VE GOT BATTERY OR FOR. BACK UP BEYOND A FOUR HOUR TIME FRAME THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA WE STAND PARTICULARLY NOW IT APPEARS. THAT THE COULD GO FOR MULTIPLE EIGHTIES WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT SYSTEM IS STATE RESILIENT. IN THE BACK CALL THE FOR THE LINES THERE ARE THE WIRELINE THAT ARE MOVING THE DATA. ARE PROTECTED SO THAT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT OF FIRE OR BREAK IT EARTHQUAKE THAT THE WRAPPED IN AND MADE HARDEN. IT'S A SIMPLE REQUESTWE'RE ASKING TO BE ABLE TO HARDEN UP THAT SYSTEM. AND IT'S A PRIORITY ON THE PART OF THE PEACE TO DO THAT AND- BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE HAS AND AS DURING THE PSP. THAT AT THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP THE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL. THE TELECOMS WE'RE- GOING ALL OVER THE WESTERN U. S. FIND A FIND GENERATORS BY THE HOT. AND DRY IN THE CALIFORNIA. REALIZING WHEN THEY GOT CALIFORNIA BORDER THAT THOSE GENERAL DID MEET AIR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS AND IN REQUIRED THE STATE BACK TO MY OFFICE TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM INTO THE STATE WHICH TOOK ACTION ON OUR PART AND THEN THERE FIND THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE GONNA GO PUT THOSE GENERATORS. THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO THAT'S REACTIVE AND NOT PROACTIVE AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE TO OUR PARTY WITH THEM. I IDENTIFY IN A PROACTIVE WAY HOW DO WE MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER BECAUSE THE ENHANCED BY ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT DID YOU HELPING TO FIND IS GOT NOW ALL THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MS RESILIENT IN A IN A BAD PART OF THE SYSTEMS GET RESERVE INTO BIG DISASTER. THANK YOU YOU MISTER. YOU KNOW IT SEEMS THAT A COMMON THEMES. TODAY AND WE I DON'T THINK WE REALLY TOUCHED ON IN DEPTH BUT WE'VE- TALKED ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES HELPING TO CREATE THE CIRCUITS THAT CUT OFF A WIRE. A COUPLE CA KIND OF FOUR'S ELECTRICITY ONCE THAT WIRES SNAPPED IN AN EVENT. TALKED ABOUT OF THOSE PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH THE GENERATOR'S AT A TIME WHEN WE CAN ALL AGREE CHEN USE GENERATORS ARE VERY HARD TO COME BY AT SUCH AN ASSET THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO ME YOU HAVE TO FEEL THAT YOU HAVE TO DELIVER IT YOU HAVE TO. GET IT OPERATIONAL. MAN AS WE TALK ABOUT A TECHNOLOGY I RECENTLY ATTENDED A NEST TEACHING THE SUPPLIER- A CONFERENCE WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLICIT. THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW ENERGY TO DELIVERY- GOALS THAN THE THEIR FUTURE BECOMING MORE COMPLEX THAN WE WANT. OF NEW TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF TODAY IN THE FUTURE AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME ONE WE HAVE. BATTERY. OF PLANTS NOW THAT EXIST IN OUR STATE THAT ARE OF USED TO STORE POWER. HAVE WE ALREADY HAVE A TECHNOLOGY WERE WE HAVE BATTERY POWERS OR POWER A POWER IN OUR STATE JUST MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME IF WE COULD. LOCATE ONE OF THOSE BATTERIES. AND EITHER A HOSPITAL OR IN THE HOME OF SOMEBODY WHO. WHO CAN'T BE SHUT OFF FROM POWER BECAUSE OF THEIR URGENT NEEDS HEALTH OR WHATEVER OTHER REASON. AND IF SOMEHOW WE COULD LOOK THOSE IN THOSE HOUSE IN THE NEXT YEAR IF THERE IS A WILL PAY TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND INCLUDE IT IN TWO. THE GOALS THAT WE'VE OUTLINED TODAY. IT JUST SEEMS MORE SENSE TO ME THAT HAVING. PUTTING THEM IN A PERMANENT LOCATION IN ANTICIPATION OF THESE EVENTS BUT HELP SOLVE A LOT OF THESE LOGISTICAL POWERS THAT WE COULD CUT OFF POWER BUT THE UTILITIES COULD STILL CHARGING THEIR CUSTOMERS POWERS AS A DROP DOWN. THAT ENERGY THAT'S BEEN STORED IN THEIR POWER IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THEY'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE MONEY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO HAVE POWER. WHEN WE COULD SOLVE THOSE THOSE GOALS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ALREADY EXISTS OR. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. YOU THINK IS PRACTICABLE IT IS A FEASIBLE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD WORK ON THE SITE HERE TO MAYBE HAVE IN PLACE BY THE TIME. THIS AND YOU KNOW THE NEXT SEASON COMES ALONG I THINK AND JUSTIN IN TERMS OF A PART OF WHAT I HEAR AND PART OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO SOLVE FOR SAFE AFFORDABLE RELIABLE AND CLEAN AND NOT TO CREATE FALSE DICHOTOMY ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH SOLVING FOR ONE OF THESE. RUNS COUNTER TO SOLVING FOR THE OTHER ONE IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS IN AND THINGS UNDER CONSIDERATION THERE SOME REALLY IMPORTANT WORK THAT IF YOU SEE HAS LAUNCHED. THAT I THINK WILL INFORM UP SOME OF THIS PART OF IT IS AN ANALYSIS OF LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE HOW- HAD POWER BEEN ON BASE WITH MODELING FOR BASED ON LINES AT THE GROUND WHAT WE THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THOSE FIRES TO UNDERSTAND. AS WE STEP BACK AND WE THINK AROUND THE USE OF. IT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON TRYING TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC FIRES NOT ANY AND ALL FIVE SO THE PLACE THAT IT YOU KNOW LOOKING SO TOOK TRYING TO UNDERSTAND KIND OF WHAT WE THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. MODELING IS IMPORTANT SOME RISK ASSESSMENT THAT IS ALSO BEING DONE- LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS WELL- AND WE LOOK AT THIS MODELING OR THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED REPEATEDLY BY THESE TYPES OF EVENTS AND THEN WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OPTIONS. AVAILABLE SURE. AS YOU KNOW AS YOU IS. YOU KNOW THE COMPANIESLOOK AT MAKING THEIR INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER PARTS. HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU MAKE THOSE SPECIMENS IN THE PLACES THAT ARE. GET THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK AND JUST LIKE IN THIS PSP A CEMENT. THERE WAS A FOCUS ON FREE FOR THE PLACES WHERE AS- AS DIRECTOR GO DUTY TALKS ABOUT THE CASCADING ABOUT EMERGENCIES SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE KEY AREAS OF FOCUS- FOR- YES WAS LOOKING AT. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH- WITH THE REFINERY WHAT'S HAPPENING WATER TREATMENT PLANTS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE PLACES WHERE IF THEY LOSE POWER AND WE DON'T HAVE A BACK UP. THEN IT RESULTS IN ANOTHER. MENTAL CHALLENGE AT THE BACK AND WE CAN IT AND END UP WITH RELEASES INTO WATER INTO OUR WATER SOURCES IT CETERA. FLYING THAT SAME KIND OF ANALYSIS TO FIGURING OUT HOW TO PRIOR. AS A HARDENING BECAUSE. HOW DECISIONS GET MADE PART OF THIS IS AROUND HOW DO YOU MITIGATE. HOW DO YOU MITIGATE RISK IN THE POTENTIAL OF THE LOCATION OF PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES BECAUSE- PREVENTING A FIRE. BUT CAN BE VERY QUICKLY PUT OUT- IS DIFFERENT THAN PREVENTING A FIRE. IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER TO FIGHT IT WHERE WE YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO HAVE PREVENTING A FIRE OUTSIDE OF A LARGE URBAN AREA VERSUS PREVENTING A FIRE. OUTSIDE IN AN AREA THAT'S NOT THE SPARSELY POPULATED. NOT ALL THE SAME THING AND THAT'S SOME OF THE IMPULSES THAT. THAT IS UNDER WAY. IS REALLY LOOKING AT. WHAT WHAT WHERE IS IT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE RISK. ANALYSIS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DATA WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THE BIGGEST CHANGE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HOW DO YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS GOING TO BE REPEATEDLY IMPACTED AND WHAT IS THE- SOLUTION AND THAT IS PART OF. YOU KNOW THAT IS PART OF WHAT EVERYONE HERE IN MANY PEOPLE NOT ERE ARE WORKING ON- A PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN CHARGED WITH IS LOOKING AT. WHAT IS A GRID OF THE FUTURE NEED TO LOOK LIKE TO SUPPORT OUR CLEAN ENERGY TOOLS- HOW DO WE NEED TO- AND HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE GET TO A GRID THAT IS MORE RESILIENT TRANSMISSION AND THAT IS MORE RESULTS. IN LIGHT OF WHERE WE ARE IN IN IN- CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE SAW FOR ALL OF THESE. OUTLINED AND WE DON'T THE SENSE OF THERE'S A FALSE DICHOTOMY OR FULL CHOICES BUT WE REALLY LOOK AT ONE OF THE BEST SOLUTIONS TO DEPLOY AGAINST THESE CHALLENGES IN A WAY THAT'S GOING TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A- SAFER. CLEANER. MAKE OUR ENERGY MORE AFFORDABLE OVER TIME. THANK. CENTER NIELSEN. OKAY CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCH HERE I'M GONNA START WITH THIS PHOTO AND JUST QUICKLY IN THIS BILL THAT'S ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE JUST TALKING TO BE HEARD- SCO PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC TODAY SAY THAT TEN YEARS IS ACCEPTABLE COULDN'T PIN DOWN I'M LINE- RIGHT. GREAT HARDENING. PAGE MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS MODERNIZATION. SIX TO NINE MONTH PLAN WHICH A SOON PART OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID FITS INTO THIS. IF YOU CAN JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON IT. WHERE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE NEXT FIRE SEASON I THINK IT'S THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THESE OUTAGES. TALK ABOUT. THE TIMELINE THAT TEN YEAR TIMELINE. I KNOW IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU AT TO THE GOVERNOR KEAN THIS BRIEF COMMENT ON THAT PLEASE. WELL I THINK- I THINK IN TERMS OF THE TIME LINE- AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR YOU'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR WE CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER YEAR LIKE THIS YEAR- AND WE- AND WE HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT. OUR GOALS IN OUR PROGRESS IN A MATTER OF DAYS WEEKS MONTHS AND NOT. WITH WITH WHAT IS IT HAS TO HAPPEN AT EVERY POINT IN TIME BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT- FIRE SEASON- IN TERMS OF. IT IN TWO TWO AND THAT. THE FOR THE FOCUS IS ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE A FOR HOWARD CLEANER HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE THE- IDIOT STEPS THAT ARE UNDER WAY. AS I A IS A IS A PRISON BUDGET HAS SPOKEN TO THERE ARE THERE IS BOTH THE WITH THE WORK ON THE INVESTIGATION THE INVESTIGATION REFORM- INFORMING. REVISED PROTOCOLS THEY REALLY TAKE A BROADER LOOK AT PUBLIC SAFETY NOT JUST FOCUSED ON. THE RISK OF CAUSING A WILDFIRE ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE LIVES ON EVERY SIDE OF THE ANGLE HERE AND- THESE DECISIONS REALLY NEED TO BE. GETTING INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY MORE BROADLY- THERE IS THE WORK THE ANALYSIS OF THEIR MENTION AROUND THE RISK ASSESSMENT. AND UNDERSTANDING. WHAT COMMUNITIES ARE MOST AT RISK. THERE ARE- THERE IS A LOT OF WORK UNDER WAY ON. WHAT IS IT YOU YOU ESTABLISHED ALL OF THE GOALS- FOR- TEN FIFTY FOUR AND FOUR P. JEANNIE COMING OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. YOU ARE WORKING. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO BRING- MORE SPACE. TO WHAT WE THINK THOSE GOALS MIGHT MEAN AND AT THE END THE P. B. WILL MAKE ITS DETERMINATION AROUND. WHAT IS A NOR TIONAL STRUCTURE THAT IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SAFE. OTHER WE HAVE UTILITY THAT IS GOING TO OPERATE SAFELY- AND- WHAT WHAT IS THE GREAT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE WHAT IT WHAT IS THE OPERATIONAL STRUCTURES CAN BE MORE NIMBLE SO IT'S ALL IT'S ALL OF THOSE ARE. WORK ON THE WAY KEY TIME LINES. THANK IN THE THEY KNOW THE JANUARY TIME LINES AS- YOU SEE YOU THE JUNE THIRTIETH TIMELINE IS A CRITICAL TIME- AREA AND WE'RE WORKING ON. IT AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S THE FIRST STEPS IN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN AND WE'RE WORKING ON ALL OF THEM HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION YEAH. WITH THE FALL OF BUT I THINK THE OTHER PIECE THAT I HAVE SOME REAL CONCERN ABOUT JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT AS WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN. THE CEOS WORK HERE IS IT BE NEAR PERFORMANCE METRICS INTO LAW. HIS CAN'T BE THE ONLY WAY TO. GET OUT OF THIS MESS. A IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE STANDARDS THAT ARE ADOPTED. WHETHER THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION LEVEL. LEGISLATIVE LEVEL SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR- AND HAVING THE PERFORMANCE INDEXES. SO THAT. RESIDENTS KNOW. EXACTLY HOW WE'RE HOLDING IN PARTICULAR CHENEY ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN THEIR INVESTMENT. ANY WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE BIG DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. THIRTY BILLION. IN TO BILLION. TALKING ABOUT. MILES A MONTH THIS CAN BE MODERNIZE. WHAT'S GOING TO BE DEPLOYED ON THE MILES OF LINE. HOW MANY MILES A LINE WILL BE HARD PER YEAR- KEEP GOING DOWN THE LINE RIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS BE HONEST. I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE GOING- ANALLY GOING WHERE THEY'RE GOING. SURE THEY UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE GOING. BY AND I THINK THAT WE OWE IT TO CALIFORNIANS HAD TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS PERFORMANCE. INDEX INTO WHAT I'D LIKE TO JUST QUICKLY MISTER CHAIR. AND TWO AT THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND I WANT TO SEE THANK YOU. TO THE DIRECTOR FOR EVERYTHING HE'S BEEN DOING- OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AT. AND WORK WITH HER. THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL HAS SOME CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO COMMUNITY RESOURCE. AND WHERE I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED IS THAT WE HAVE TO DRILL DOWN. AND ESPECIALLY WITH A COLD WEATHER EVENT ESPECIALLY IT'S COMING UP FOR THE CAN ANOTHER A POWER SHUT OFF WE HAVE TO DO WHAT IT TAKES AND- I REALLY DON'T GIVE TWO FLIPS I DON'T THINK YOU GIVE TO FLIPS ABOUT HOW IT GETS DONE BUT WE NEED TO FORCE. IN PARTICULAR PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC BILL TO HAVE THEIR THE RESOURCES DEPLOYED. INTO THE COMMUNITIES. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT DRILLING DOWN TODAY AND NE OF THE WORD YOU'RE MOUTH I THINK THAT'S BEEN A BIT OF A FRUSTRATION ABOUT. GETTING THE DETAILS AND GETTING THOSE DETAILS TO. POINT AND PUT INTO ACTION. WELL THE- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'M I MEAN THAT THE ISSUE WITH THE- COMMITTEE RESEARCH THAT IS I THINK IT'S JUST- SORT OF A- A SYMPTOM OF THE LARGER SET OF. THE DETAILS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH MANAGING. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS RIGHT THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF IS A DISASTER IT COULD BE AN ALLERGY A CYBER TACTICS OUT THE POWER GRID AND ALL THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT'S IN ESSENCE WHAT WE HAD BUT WE ACTUALLY DID AND WE KNEW DOING IT RIGHT. THEN YOU THROW IN THAT WHILE FIRES AND AN EARTHQUAKE IN A REFINERY FIRE YEAH HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. SO SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT METRICS AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE MEASUREMENT- THAT IN THE DETAIL AND YO CAN REALLY EFFECTIVELY BUILD AND CAN PLAN- WITH WITH- ACHIEVABLE OBJECTIVES PER OPERATIONAL PERIOD WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE DETAILS SO DRILLING DOWN TO EXACTLY WHERE THOSE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS ARE GOING TO BE WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE IN THEM HOW OFTEN- AND WHAT IS THE ASSURANCE THAT THE ICE WILL BE DELIVERED. GIVEN THE FACT THAT IN. FIVE DAY PS PS EVENT ALL THE ICE IN CALAVERAS COUNTY IS NOW GONE BECAUSE THERE'S NO FREEZER CAPACITY AND THEY SAY THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH I CAN'T GET ICE. TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS DOES THAT ANSWER IT DOES NOT MEET THE METRIC. WE GET ICE AT THAT CENTER SOUL BACK WE ARE JOB REALLY IS TRY TO IDENTIFY THOSE GAPS AND FILL THOSE GAPS AND THEN AND THEN YOU KNOW. LEAN IN ALL WITH P. JEANNIE IN THIS CASE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED THAT THAT ADDRESS TO THE DETAILS AND IF THEY CAN'T DO IT. HELP THEM GET THERE AND THAT'S IN ESSENCE WHAT WE DID ON THIS LAST GO AROUND BUT THERE EAT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF INCIDENT MANAGEMENT. NEEDS TO CHANGE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING A MAJOR DISASTER OPERATION DETAIL MATTER AND YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT FROM NOT A THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW. BUT UP FROM ON THE GROUND IN THAT'S ONE REASON IT TALKS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL REIMBURSEMENT OF LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGERS. FIRE DEPARTMENTS POLICE DEPARTMENTS SHERIFF'S OFFICES BECAUSE- IT'S NOT HAPPENING. THE NEED DOESN'T STOP AFTER EIGHT PM. THIS IS WELL SO I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON IS A PRIOR TO THE LIGHTS GOING OUT. IF THEY NEED TO GO OUT. AT THAT WE HAVE STANDARDS IN PLACE SO THAT THE PUBLIC IS WHAT RESOURCES AVAILABLE MY LAST ITEM IS ON. CELL TOWERS. SO AS YOU HEARD MR DIRECTOR WE MET WITH TELECOMMUNICATION REPRESENTATIVES EARLIER IN THE YEAR. A TOTAL IS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD NOT HAVE. SO NOW WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WHERE I BELIEVE WE ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED SITES DOWN ACROSS CALIFORNIA. EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND LAND IS OUT. A SCRAMBLE TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT GENERATORS FROM TEXAS THEY DIDN'T THE DEADLINE. AND. CANDIDLY NO STANDARDS IN PLACE AS A MATTER PRESENT YOUR IT IS TALKING ABOUT. WOULD YOU SAY THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST GAPS- WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC SAFETY OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE YOU SEE YOURSELF PHONE- AND AT YOUR THOUGHT. PLEASE. WELL I'M JUST AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALWAYS I MEAN IT'S. PLEASE IT WILL WE ARE AS A SOCIETY THE END OF THIS IS THE ONLY OPTION. NO MORE LAND LINES THERE'S NO MODE DIAL UP SERVICE THAT'S GOING AWAY EVERYTHING'S GOING TO DATA. THESE ARE WONDERFUL FANTASTIC CRITICAL THINGS AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DEPEND ON A FOR EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEIR WORK AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE- NOW EVERYTHING FROM. BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO TRACKING YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS EVERYTHING IS ON THESE DEVICES AND IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT THEIR OPERATIONAL. AND THAT YOU CAN MOVE THAT DATA BACK AND FORTH. AND THAT HOSPITALS CAN GET RECORDS WHEN THEY NEED IT OR YOU KNOW JAILS CAN. CAN BOOK AND YOU KNOW DEAL PRISONERS AND WHATEVER ELSE THE CASE MAY BE SO- IT IS A WEAK LINK- AT. THEIR SYSTEM AND IT'S SOMETHING WE AS WERE. UP EATING THE- THE POWER GRID IN THE UTILITY SYSTEM WE NEED TO EQUALLY UPGRADE THE SELL SIDE GET. MAKE IT HARDER. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRPERSON. THANK THIS PANEL FOR THE INTER AGENCY COORDINATION AND- THE GOVERNOR'S OBVIOUSLY. BLOWN UP A LOT OF SILENCE AND I'M JUST INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED AT OF THE CHALLENGES ARE GONNA BE DAUNTING HERE AND I'M- SOME AREAS WHERE WE WERE TO REMAIN FRUSTRATED AFTER WORK THROUGH. THINGS BUT THE INTER AGENCY COORDINATIONIS NOTEWORTHY. THREE QUICK QUESTIONS ONE FOR PRESIDENT BOETTCHER. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU INTEGRATE YOUR PIECE TO OF THE P. S. P. S. PLANNING INTO YOUR WILD- MITIGATION PLANNING TIME LINE SO THERE IS YOU'VE GOT A SORT OF EXPEDITED TRACK OF THIS P. S. P. S. O. I. ARE GOING ON. AND WHAT'S UNDERLYING MY QUESTION IS I'M WORRIED THAT A DATE LIKE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AND I'M WORRIED THAT. A JUNE NEXT. YEAR TIMELINE FOR UPDATING THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION LANDS ACT. SO HOW CAN WE FIND IT. SORT OF AN EXPEDITED CHUNK EVEN AN INTERIM COMPONENT OF THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT JUST ADDRESS P. S. P. S. PERHAPS ONE OF THE VERY NEAR TERM BASIS SO THAT WE CAN. SORT OF. START MOVING CRITICAL SERVICES OUT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW- SO I JUST WANNA GET YOURS SENSE OF HOW. IF THERE TO WAIT A- I THINK THE LAW GIVES YOU ALL SOME DISCRETION TO NOT JUST GOING TO ONE YEAR IN A THREE YEAR TIME LINE BUT ON SOMETHING MORE TRUNCATED FOR A FOR THIS SMALLER DISCRETE PIECE BUT- I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF IF THERE WAS OPEN THIS TO THAT AND TRY TO GET SOME. SO THERE'S DEMONSTRABLE PROGRESS EVEN BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE. A SERIES OF INCIDENTS. GOING ON A HOLIDAY SEASON. WELL AS I HAD. THANK YOU SENATOR AS- HAD MENTIONED EARLIER- RIGHT AWAY WE CALLED AN EMERGENCY. MEETING AND THAT WAS FOR THE PURPOSES. ASKING GINNY SPECIFICALLY. WHAT THEY HAD DONE WHY THEY HAD DONE IT AND FRANKLY WHY THEY HADN'T DONE IT BETTER. AND THAT WAS- BEFORE THE EVENTS IN LATE OCTOBER THAT WAS A FOR TWINS. AND I DO THINK THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP THAT WERE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS THE C. R. LACUS YOUR SEATS AND THE LACK OF THE WEB'S. TANNING THE LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE TRIBES. THINGS THAT FRANKLY AT THE TIME AND I REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES ARE. IF YOU'RE AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OR IF YOU'RE IN EVENT PLANNING FOR GOODNESS SAKE THESE ARE FAIRLY. EASY THINGS THAT YOU THINK OF AHEAD OF TIME AND YOU DO WELL AHEAD OF TIME YOU'RE NOT DOING IT AT THE MOMENT CRISIS. SO THAT WAS WELL POINTED OUT- TO- P. JEANNIE I DO AND THEY ADMITTED. IT WE ARE TRACKING THEIR IMPROVEMENT WEEKLY. I'M THEY ARE AS I ALSO MENTIONED WE HAVE A SHOW CAUSE HEARING COMING UP I DON'T KNOW THAT WILL IMPROVE THEIR ACTIVITIES I THINK OF JUST BRING OUT A VERY. A TRAINED LIGHT ON THE SITUATION AND HAVE THEM DEFEND WHY THEY SHOULDN'T BE SIGNED SANCTIONED HER FIND AT THE- MORE SPECIFICALLY. FOR BRINGING THEM. IN BEFORE THE COMMISSION THE REGULATOR. AS A PRIVILEGED A LICENSE AND CITY AND EXPLAINING WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND WHY AND WHAT WE REFER TO IMPROVE IN REAL TIME I DO THINK THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BUT EVENT AN EVENT TO IN OCTOBER. ARE THEY A 100% BETTER. THAT'S ALL THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IT WHAT I HOPE TO DO AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS DOING IS MAKING SURE THAT THE FIRE SEASON. THIS YEAR LOOKS NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE SAW ON OCTOBER IN TERMS. THE USE AN IMPLEMENTATION OF PS PS SO TO ANSWER YOU DIRECTLY I THAT THE REGULATORY SYSTEM IS NOT REALLY ESTABLISH OR SET UP. ACT QUICKLY I THINK WE PROBABLY ALL AGREE ON THAT UNFORTUNATELY. BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS THE REGULATOR SHINE A BRIGHT LIGHT ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING AND WHAT THEY NEED TO BE DOING IF I CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES THEN. WE WANT EXPEDITED ACTION AND FOR PEOPLE NOT TO GO SPEND THEIR CHRISTMAS BONUS ON A DIESEL GENERATOR THAT MIGHT LIKE THEIR HOUSE ON FIRE AND POLLUTE THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD- AND INSTEAD STATE TRY TO. SPEND MONEY SAY ON. YOU KNOW SOME SOLAR MOBILE BATTERY OR SOME OTHER WAY TO KEEP THEIR GRANDPARENTS SAFE. I MEAN THE NEAR TERM THESE ARE LIKE THIS WEEK DECISIONS. THE FLOW THAT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A BACKUP POWER MONEY THAT WENT ON AN EXPEDITED BASIS WE GOT GOING THROUGH HELLO YES. MIGHT BE A MORE EXPEDITIOUS WITH A TO GET DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR GET RESOURCE PLAY. FROM A NON RATE PAYER BASE- IF WE WANT TO GET SOMETHING GOING IN THE NEAR TERM- I DO STILL WONDER WHERE THE UTILITIES. ON ON THE SHARED FOLDER SIDE CAN STEP UP AND PUT SOME MONEY FORWARD AND SORT OF MEET THE STATE HALFWAY. PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVES- STATE GET THAT TEAM HUNDRED DOLLAR THOUSAND WHAT SYSTEM HOW TO THE PLACES THAT THE CHAIRMAN. MENTIONED RIGHT NOW FIND AT SAID. GOLLY VERY- ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. ALL THE SITES THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING THE CHECKING UP ON. HOW MANY PEOPLE IS THA IN THAT UNIVERSE WOULD YOU SAY STATEWIDE OF SAY EVEN JUST YOUR LICENSE BASILIDES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN THESE P. S. P. S. OWNS I MEAN. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE OTHER WE TALKING A MILLION PEOPLE THE OF IT. I KNOW YOU SAID A LOT OF DATA AND NOT CREATE INFORMATION GIVE A SENSE OF. HOW BIG THIS UNIVERSE. COULD TRY TO DELIVER SOME SOLID AND AS YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION OF MONEY. YEAH BUT WE'RE WE'RE TANKS TURNING INTO AREAS WERE. BEING REDUNDANT NOT GONNA. ASTRIDE A TRAITOR. BUT I APPRECIATE IT IT HAS BUT- GO AHEAD AND ANSWER THE QUESTION IS. IF USING AND BUT WE STILL HAVE THIRTEEN PRINT. AND WE'RE NOT FIFTH HOUR SO SIR. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'LL BE BRIEF WE ESTIMATE THAT IN THE LAST PS PS EVENTS ABOUT IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE AYE HSS PROGRAM. THE NUMBER BASILIDES IN THOSE ZONES. ON THE PUBLIC SIDE WITH THE CAPACITY FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF REST AND THEN ON THE I'M SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE YOU HAD NEARLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FACILITIES BECAUSE THAT INCLUDES- MANY OF THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES THAT RUN EIGHT TO FIVE RATHER THAN AROUND THE CLOCK. SO IN TOTAL YOU'RE LOOKING AT A. THOUSANDS OF POTENTIALLY IMPACTED PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES THROUGH STATE AID. THOSE THEIR WEIGHT IN OTHER WORDS TO HONE IN THAT UNIVERSE AND START GETTING- SOME KIND OF BACKUP SYSTEMS THAT ARE DIESEL GENERATORS OUT THE DOOR BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR TO THOSE PEOPLE. OWNER IN. THIS MODEST ON TOAST. LIKE A REASONABLE GOAL FOR US NOT WAITING UNTIL JANUARY NEXT YEAR BUT TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE- BEFORE THE HOLIDAY. SOME OF THE SOME OF THAT IS- IS HAPPENING AND AS A PRISON BADGERS. THE LEARNINGS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED A TIME. AND THE WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE UTILITY SIDE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE IS CHANGING AT EVERY CORNER AND- SOME OF THE AREA OF FOCUS ON THE AREA OF THE PRIORITIES ARE THESE CLICK CRITICAL FACILITIES WHERE IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY BUT THEN YOU HAVE THESE THESE OVERALL DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS SO- BUT IN IN IN TERMS OF THE BIGGER INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF THE OF THE LONGER TERM- ACTIONS. I THINK SOME OF THOSE WILL BE HAPPENING OVER TIME AND OF THE- WHAT THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK FOR THE UTILITY WAS IN THE FOR THE POOL IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY DEPLOYED- TECHNOLOGY AND THEY DEPLOY GENERATION WERE INTEREST IN WANTING TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY ACQUIRE THOSE SO THAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF FOR THE SOLUTIONS WHERE THEY WERE TEMPORARY ONES IN NATURE HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE ON. OUR OUR LONG TERM THE OTHER PIECE THAT I'D HIGHLIGHT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE CAPACITY GENERATION IS IT COULD BE THAT THE INITIAL SOLUTION THAT GETS IMPLEMENTED IS A DIESEL GENERATOR BUT THAT CAN BE SWAPPED OUT WITH A CLEANER- CLEANER SOURCE- IN STORAGE SO PART OF THIS IS HOW DO WE GET THE RIGHT KIND OF- OF GRADE AND STRUCTURE IN PLACE. HOW DO YOU GET THE GENERATION- TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICE IN A WAY. THAT YOU KNOW WORKS IN AND MINIMIZES PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACTS AND THEN OVER TIME HOW DO WE ENSURE IF IT TAKES TIME IF IT CAN'T BE DONE IN ONE FELL SWOOP HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE KIND OF THE NO REGRETS INVESTMENTS THAT CAN BE MAPPED UP WITH THE- CLEAN INVESTMENTS TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO CONSISTENT ONE OF OUR GOALS DO YOU. I MEAN IF I'M SCRAPING TOGETHER A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I'M A- CLASS FAMILY MAKING EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS TO BUY THAT DIESEL GENERATOR YOU CAN'T SWAP THAT OUT YOU BOUGHT THAT DIESEL GENERATOR AND THAT'S KIND OF. SAID RIGHT I MEAN IT'S THE FOLKS GOVERNOR VISITED SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SWAP THAT APPLE. I GUESS I THE ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOWARDS IS HOW DO WE MINIMIZE. THIS OF P. SPS AT ALL SO THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS GOING OUT AND BUYING TECHNOLOGY. FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE USED SPARINGLY AND NOT AND NOT REQUIRE YOU WOULD JUST. TAPPING BACK MY PORTER RICO EXPERIENCE. WE DON'T WANT CALIFORNIA TO THINK THAT THEY'RE LIVING IMPORTER RICO BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT- WE HAVE A MUCH MORE RESILIENT SYSTEM. WE HAVE- WE CAN SEE FROM THE SAN DIEGO EXPERIENCE THAT- THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE WANT TO CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE FOLKS SAY. THIS THIS THIS IS NOT A NEW NORMAL IT CANNOT BE IT WILL NOT BE. THERE ARE BETTER STRONGER SOLUTIONS AND I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO I DON'T THINK. WE WANT TO CREATE A SENSE OF. EVERYONE FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE WRONG SOLUTION. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE BEST FOR THE ENVIRONENT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST AFFORDABLE AND IT'S NOT WHAT IS NECESSARY. OKAY CENTER STERN I'M GONNA MOVE TO CENTER WINTER NOW MEGAN DRESS ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT WASN'T THAT WASN'T BROUGHT UP JUST VERY VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU DON'T MIND MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST THE FINAL. THE FINAL ONE FOR AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY AND ASKING. DIRECTOR DANSA. THAT'LL ECONOMIC LOSSES. THIS ONE HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE. PROMISE YOU YOU'LL BE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED WELL. ASK YOUR BEST YOUR QUESTION BUT- THANK YOU. A STORY AND- UTILITY SAID. MEDICAL AND FOOD SPOILAGE COSTS COVERED I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ECONOMIC LOSSES. HAS BEEN MONITORING THE SENATE. COMMERCE IS CONCERNED ABOUT IT. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE. ONE EIGHT SEVEN IN THE- LAW ONE FORMER. US POSES BALLY. OF FROM YES PS INCIDENT. I TELL YOU HOW MANY MORE IN. THE REGION BUT YOU KNOW. THEREFORE WHEN. CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND STATE WHAT CHAMBERS BEEN DOING SOME SURVEYING. MS A CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO CHARGE CHARTER IS GOING TO. COMMISSION A MUCH LARGER STUDY FOR WHAT THE OVERALL IMPACT WAS BUT IT'S NOT THAT GRANULAR THEY'RE ALL ANECDOTAL AT THIS POINT. ENTER WINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I HAVE A BILL FOR THAT SO. FOR I HAVE A- A QUESTION FOR- PRINCE ABOUT SURE AND- I PROMISE YOU I'M NOT A ONE TRICK PONY- TERMS THIS ISSUE BUT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE COVERED THE OTHER AREAS SO SYSTEMATICALLY AND THOROUGHLY THAT I DON'T WANT TO. RECREATE THE WHEEL. IN TERMS OF- DODD DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AND ENERGY STORAGE IN PARTICULAR AND THAT'S CHIP AND OF COURSE DVRS AS CHIP ANSWERED IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT POWER SHUTTLE SO I. I KNOW THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW GETTING PEOPLE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS FOR. TRIAGE SITUATIONS THAT HOPEFULLY WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN OR WILL TELL FOR A TIME- THERE MANY MANY ADVANTAGES TO HAVING- DECENTRALIZE- GENERATION. ONE OF WHICH IS DURING EMERGENCIES AND SO. BEST TIPS IS AS YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND WE ARE GOING TODOZEN OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT BY SENT YOU A LETTER AND YOU- RESPONDED- WITHOUT MAKING COMMITMENTS AND I GOT THAT YOU HAVE AN ONGOING- PROCEEDING- BUT YEAR THIS LEGISLATURE- RE AUTHORIZE US TO. AND WITH A CERTAIN MAXIMUM FUNDING LEVEL- AND THE IDEA IS TO HAVE YOU KNOW THE SONGS SEVEN YEAR PERIOD SO THAT PEOPLE CAN RELY ON AND THE INDUSTRY CAN LIVE RELY ON AND WE CAN REALLY. BECAUSE THE ENERGY STORAGE SECTOR TO BLOSSOM AND PRICES TO COME DOWN IN THE COLLEGE OR TO GET BETTER AND- SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE MORE MORE DAYS OF STORAGE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THIS- ABOUT FOR TO SUCCEED. IN OUT THE HOUSE TO BE FUNDED AND I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW THERE IS A AND YOU HEARD I. SPOKE TO THAT A SEVEN P. GINNY REPRESENTATIVES THAT YOU KNOW THE- THE COMMISSION PUT OUT ITS REQUEST FOR- FEEDBACK AND PUT OUT THE IDEA OF NOT FULLY FUNDING AND WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE CHIMING THE WATERS JUST TO BE BLUNT AND ALL OF THE I. USE CAME BACK AS IT YEAH DEFINITELY DON'T FULLY FUNDED. AND THEY'RE PROPOSALS- WOULD DESTROY THE PROGRAMS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CPUC IS GOING TO DO. AROUND US CHIP AND IS THE COMMISSION COMMITTED TO MAKING THIS A FULLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM BECAUSE I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT IF THE COMMISSION DOESN'T FULLY FUNDED OR TAKE SOME OF THE I. R. USE IDEAS. THE PROGRAM WILL NOT SUCCEED IN THAT ONE IT'S UP FOR REAUTHORIZATION. EVERYONE'S GOING TO SAY CITY IT'S IN SIXTY LET'S KELLER. WELL AS YOU STATED WE HAVE SEEN IN THE NIGHT SO I CAN'T. PRESUME THE- WHAT THE COMMISSION WOULD DO THAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER I KNOW THAT THE IN OUR DISCUSSIONS AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE ALSO MET WITH. MY FELLOW COMMISSIONER- BUT IF YOU COULD PLEASE SPEAK INTO THE MIKE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SORRY I KNOW THAT YOU'VE MET WITH YOU AND I HAVE BAD ON THIS SUBJECT AS YOU HAVE MET WITH MY- COLLEAGUE- COMMISSIONER WRECK SHAMAN. AND SO WE'RE VERY AWARE AND VERY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROGRAM YOUR CONCERNS THOSE OF YOUR FELLOW COLLEAGUES- WE WILL BE IN. MAKING A DECISION I THINK IN AND FOR THREE TO FOUR WEEKS. OKAY SO- AND I JUST WANT TO IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS ENCOURAGE THE COMMISSION. TO FULLY FUND THE AND YOU KNOW THERE IS A SURPLUS IN THE FUND ONLY BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY THAT'S BEEN AROUND THIS PROGRAM FOR A LONG TIME. AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS MONEY WILL BE- ACCESS AND WE'LL SEE A SIGNIFICANT. EXPANSION OF STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA IF THE COMMISSION DOES THE RIGHT THING IN PULLING FUNDS I LISTENED VERY CLOSELY TODAY TO YOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL AS THE ANSWERS ON THE I. O. U.'S SO I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH SIR. THANK YOU. SENATOR BILL. OF HISTORY REAL QUICK I'M I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE ECONOMIC FISCAL IMPACTS AND JUST. GETTING ORDER BEHIND THE- REQUESTS FROM VARIOUS MINUTES POLICIES GOVERNMENTS FOR MONEY FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT THE- ROAD TO THIS ISSUE AND I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF. COST ESTIMATOR OR THERE'S BEEN SOME MODELING DONE ON THAT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE SOME CONSISTENT. HEROES NOT OFF THE CUFF CHI REPROACH. TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT ISSUE I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT SO I KNOW THERE'S SOME MODELING INTERRUPTION COST ESTIMATORS THERE'S ALL KINDS OF- ECONOMIC. OF WAYS OF DOING THAT AND IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT DONE IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY SO WE GET A HANDLE ON THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE FAIR WE DON'T WANT A- HAVE ONE GROUP SAY WELL YOU GAVE THEM A LOT OF MONEY BUT NOT THIS GROUP AND- THOSE KINDS OF THINGS REGARDING. POWER OUTAGE- COST TO MUNICIPALITIES OKAY SO I JUST WANT TO SIT IS THAT POSSIBLE IS THAT. IS THAT A DOABLE ASK ME IN THE MAKE RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION FIRST. THE EXISTING MODELS TO DO THAT OUR MODELS YEAH THEIR MODELS. THAT BERKELEY'S LIVERMORE YEAH RIGHT THERE'S A STANFORD ONE AND STANFORD WAS RELYING ON THAT MODEL TO DO THEIR OWN ESTIMATES. THEIR MDELS AND SOPHIE ONE ACTUAL ASSESSMENTS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO MORE STAFF COMPLETE. NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT THE REAL COSTS- COOLEY- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE RIGHT EXACT AS A MODEL IN. OKAY SO THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS SO. THE SCENARIO OF FARM. THAT I PREFER AND WHEN I LOOK AT THESE THINGS SO. I LOOK AT TEN YEAR WHEN THEY SAY TEN YEARS THAT MEANS NOTHING TO MAKE US TEN YEARS TO FOR A RISE AND IT'S. YOU KNOW I'M USED TO CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS LIKE ON A WORKING ENVIRONMENT SO TEN YEARS ISLIKE SAYING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. IT'S KIND OF LIKE. IT IS A MEANINGLESS STATEMENT OKAY. SO THAT'S WHY I SAY THREE YEARS. AND WE HAVE A SCENARIO DEVELOPED WHERE- ALL THE EQUIPMENT CAN BE. WORKED ON IN THREE YEARS AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT ISSUE. GETTING BACK TO THE MODELING- WHEN YOU LOOK AT- REDUCING REDUCING THE POWER INTERRUPTION AND REDUCING THE COST OF THAT WILL HAVE A POSITIVE ECONOMIC AFFECT ON CALIFORNIA IF WE CAN CUT THAT TEN YEARS DOWN TO THREE YEARS AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE. THAT SCENARIO FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT I KNOW THE MODEL I KNOW. WHAT I'VE STUDIED IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THIS IS NOT SO MUCH ONE ERUPTION DEBTS THE REPEATED ON GOING YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR OF INTERRUPTIONS WHEN THE- BUSINESSES SORT OF TIRE OF THIS THE- INSURANCE COMPANIES TIRE OF THIS AND ALSO A NEW ECONOMY IS. JUST OVER TIME THE INTERRUPTION JUST HAS A HUGE. IT IMPACT IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA SO LOOK AT THE NEXT I'M LOOKING AT A TEN YEAR DECADE OF THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT'S NOT AN ACCEPTABLE THING. I MEAN WE CAN'T HAVE. THAT KIND OF. ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW I REPRESENT. A MILLION PEOPLE OF IN SILICON VALLEY- WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD ON ECONOMY BUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT ARE. THEY'RE KIND OF LOOK AT THIS AND YOU KNOW THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE THEIR HIGH ENERGY USERS- THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT BACKUP POWER- THERE IS PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR THEY'RE NOT SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE BUT THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT IT. THIS IS MAKING PEOPLE VERY VERY NERVOUS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TEN YEARS THAT WAS THAT THAT WAS- THAT HAD A NERVE TEN YEARS THAT HIT A NERVE. SO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME. SCENARIOS THAT ARE. FASTER TO FIND TO FIND OUT WHAT WE CAN DO IT IN THREE YEARS IS THAT IS THAT A SOONER WE CAN- LOOK OUT BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT WOULD IT SEEMS TO ME HAVE PRETTY. HUGE MAGNITUDE FISCAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA A LOT OF JOBS WILL BE LOST YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING. A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING. I WOULD THOSE THIRTY RESPONSE TO THAT- JUST SAY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED- HI TO WE AND THAT'S PART OF WHY ARE FOCUSING CHARGE IS AROUND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT WEEK NEXT MONTH IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS THE NEXT THE- IN THE NEXUS SIX NINE MONTHS TO ASSURE THAT NEXT YEAR IS NOT THIS YEAR OF THE YEAR AFTER THAT IS BETTER THAN THE YEAR BEFORE- BECAUSE THE DISRUPTIVE EFFECT THE UNCERTAINTY ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE A CHALLENGE FOR- OTHER CHALLENGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE ON ACCEPTABLE AND- AND WE NEED TO. WORK TOWARDS MAKING THE CHANGES ARE YOU KNOW CULTURAL- ORGANIZATIONAL- INFRASTRUCTURE WAS THAT NEED TO OCCUR TO MAKE THE USE OF PSP S. SPARING AND- AND IDEALLY WERE TIME FACED OUT THE NOT UNKNOWN OR ARE YOU A SHOE IS INSURANCE ISSUE AND AGAIN I THINK THE ONE TIME LOOK AT ECONOMIC IMPACT. MIGHT BE SMALL. IT MIGHT NOT BE I DON'T KNOW OF BUT THE REPEATED ON GOING. POWER SHORTAGE OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD. AND THE AND THE COST TO THE CONSUMER AND BUSINESS I THINK IT'S MORE OF A COST TO BUSINESS AND RESIDENTIAL WHEN I SAW THE MODELS IT LOOKS LIKE THE BUSINESS IMPACT WAS MUCH DOLLAR WISE A BIGGER. A BIGGER IMPACT. IF WE HAVE THIS ON A REPEATED BASIS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. OF THAT WOULD HAVE A HUGE A MUCH BIGGER ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCE OF MY RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE COST TO INSURANCE AND THEN AND THEN MAYBE INSURANCE PEOPLE WITHDRAWING FROM PROVIDING INSURANCE- TO- OF OUR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL. WORST BE ANOTHER THING THAT WILL CAUSE THEM TO WANT TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA IN THAT SENSE. YOU ARE CORRECT THE ONGOING AND SUSTAINED. ACTIVITY OF THIS SORT WOULD BE REALLY DAMAGING AND THE- SERVING THAT WE'VE DONE OF BUSINESSES AND VISITORS SO FAR IT HAS NOT BEEN THAT DAMAGING BUT IF IT CONTINUES AT ABSOLUTELY COULD BE AND I AGREE WITH YOU. CENTER WITH ELEMENT LIKE A SCENARIO TO BE DEVELOPED ON A THREE YEAR THAT'S WHAT BASE I THINK IT'S TOO. IT WOULD HELP TOO MUCH IN MY EAR AND I WOULD HAVE TOO MUCH OF A CONSEQUENCE SO. AND CENTER BELL I HOPE THAT WE CAN DO I'M AFRAID IF YOU KEEP SPEAKING IN A DRIVE AWAY ALL THE BUSINESSES CALIFORNIA WELL. I'M HERE I MET I'M GETTING MY MIND MY CALLS FROM PEOPLE SAYING THEY'RE VERY NERVOUS. RIGHT NOW ALL OF. ESPECIALLY THE HIGH ENERGY USERS ARE VERY NERVOUS RIGHT NOW THANK YOU CENTER BELT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IT TOO OKAY I'M SORRY CENTER PRESS MIGHT VERY QUIRK- TO THE OFFICE OF ALL YES I'M JUST CURIOUS. AS P. JEANNIE WAS COORDINATING WITCHER OFFICE THEIR PS PS PROGRAM WAS THERE ANY OBJECTION ARE PUSHED BACK BY YOUR OFFICE WITHIN THE THINGS THAT THEY HAD SUGGESTED BOTH IN THE FIRST PHASE AND SECOND. WAS THERE PUSHED BACK BY MY OFFICE BACK INTHEM ABOUT NOT WANTING TO DO SOMETHING AND TRY TO SPEAK INTO THE MIKE. PLEASE SEE CORRECTION TO OBJECT AS TO WHAT THEY SUGGESTED. I WOULD SAY THERE WAS ANY PUSH BACK I THINK THAT THAT THAT THERE WAS- I THINK IT WAS MORE SUGGESTIONS ON ON OUR SIDE BACK TO THEM ON BEING ABLE TO THINK THROUGH WHAT WAS GOING TO BE HAPPENING AS A YOU KNOW GIVEN OUR EXPERIENCE OF UNDERSTANDING HOW DISASTERS AND FOLD AND SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY GIVING THEM RECOMMENDATIONS ON- HOW HOW THEY COULD BE- HOW THEY COULD ADDRESS IT AND POSITION THEMSELVES BETTER- SUCH AS- GENERALLY- THEY THEY SEEM TO BE OPEN TO MOST OF THOSE THE NECESSARY IMPLEMENT ALL OF THEM- AND- I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY MORE IN THE TIME FRAME OF THE YEAR LEADING UP TO THE PS B. AS WE WERE WE WERE MEETING THE WEEKLY- I PROBABLY GOT MORE PUSH BACK FROM UTILITIES. ALL THREE QUITE FRANKLY WITH REGARD TO- WANTING THEM TO GET IN A PLACE WHERE THEY WERE MORE CONSISTENT ACROSS- ACROSS THE BOARD BUT ACT ACTUALLY DURING THE P. S. B. AS IN THE CASE OF P. JEANNIE THEY WERE THEY WERE WRAPPED THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH OPEN TO OUR SUGGESTIONS EIGHT INCORPORATED PRETTY MUCH ALL YOUR SUGGESTIONS ABOUT ALL OF THEM BUT THEY WERE YOU KNOW I MEAN- THEY NEVER HAD UP THE PHONE ON ME IS THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW. THANK. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING ON TOUR NEXT. OUR OUR NEXT SECTION OF THIS- COMMITTEE HEARING IS REGARDING THE IMPACTS ON CALIFORNIANS. AND WE HAVE THIRTEEN SPEAKERS THAT ARE GOING TO SPEAK TO HOW THEY WERE IMPACTED BY THE SHUT OFF AND I'M GONNA ASK OF THE SPEAKERS IF EACH. CAN ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THEIR EXPERIENCES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU CAN HEAR ME IF YOU CAN A TO- AS YOU COME FORWARD I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO- LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES THAT'S POSSIBLE PLEASE. WE DO HAVE THIRTY SPEAKERS AND IF YOU COULD TO AS MUCH POSSIBLE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT TWO MINUTES FOR PRESENTATION. WE'RE GOING TO BE IT BEGIN WITH ELDERLY ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS POPULATION THE MATHEMATICALLY VULNERABLE. AND WE HAVE- CRISTINA MILLS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. AND CRISTINA BUS HAMILTON LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS OF AMERICA. FOLLOWED BY TRACY MCBROOM THE SYSTEMS DIRECTOR OF AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. FOR ADVENTIST HEALTH WELCOME. AND LET ME SEE HERE WHO ELSE TO HAVE. JIM MCCARTHY. OKAY THAT ARE COMMON TO. ALL RIGHT WHO. CRISTINA MILLS OKAY WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU CHAIRED THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M GONNA TRY TO SPEED IT THROUGH MY TESTIMONY I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS STAYING IN TAKING THIS AS SERIOUS AS WE ARE IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AGAIN I'M CRISTINA MILLS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER SEE A FILE SEE WE REPRESENT CALIFORNIA'S DISABILITY COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS KNOWN AS INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS AND OUR MEMBERSHIP COVERS FIFTY SIX OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS PROVIDE ADVOCACY ASSISTANCE IN A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC SERVICES DIRECTLY TO PEOPLE WITH ANY TYPE OF DISABILITY AND EFFORT TO EMPOWER AND SUPPORT DISABLED PEOPLE IN OBTAINING OR MAINTAINING THEIR INDEPENDENCE IN THE COMMUNITY AND OUT OF INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS YOU WILL HEAR DIRECTLY FROM SOME OF OUR SEE IF I'LL SEE MEMBERS DURING PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDED DURING THE OCTOBER PS PSE THAT'S- SEE IF I'LL SEE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING IN THE AREA OF DISASTER READINESS AND RECOVERY. OUR OFFICE HAS COMMISSIONED A NUMBER OF BEST PRACTICES AN AFTER ACTION DISASTER REPORT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND HAS WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH STATE AND WELL KNOWN NATIONAL DISASTER SERVICE EXPERTS TO IMPROVE AND INTEGRATE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS WHO HAVE ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS IN DISASTER OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE WITNESS THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ARE CONTINUOUSLY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED DURING DISASTERS WHICH NOW ALSO INCLUDE PUBLIC POWER CD SAFETY SHUT OFFS. NATURAL DISASTERS AND PS PS IMPACT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY IN SIMILAR WAYS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AMONG THE TWO IS THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSIST PEOPLE WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL LEAD SOMEWHAT IN ADVANCE OF A SHUT OFF HOWEVER SEE IF I'LL SEE BELIEVES THAT A MAJOR EFFORT A LOCAL LEVEL NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE AND MUST INCLUDE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. SERVE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS AS PART OF THAT PROCESS DEVELOPING. PROCESSES AND ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WITH ACCESSIBLE. LEADS ARE AWARE OF LOCAL SUPPORT AND ARE PROVIDED ONE ON ONE TRAINING TO HAVE PERSONAL DISASTER PLANS IN PLACE IS ESSENTIAL. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT. ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION GAS MONEY BACK UP ELECTRICITY SYSTEMS BOTH BATTERIES AND GENERATORS ACCESSIBLE SHORT TERM HOUSING FOOD ASSISTANCE OF ROBUST ACCESSIBLE COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT REACHES PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING REQUIRES WELL THOUGHT OUT PLANNING AND RESOURCES. WE ALSO CANNOT EXPECT THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRAINED AND READY ONLY NEED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS DURING BUSINESS OUR DAYLIGHT HOURS. THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE A ROLE DURING P. S. P. S. OR NATURAL DISASTERS IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SEPARATE THE TWO BECAUSE OF HOW SIMILAR THEY ARE. WE IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITY ACCORDING TO THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED REPORT FROM THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE HAVE A DISABILITY. HOW MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ALSO HAVE ELECTRICAL MEDICAL NEEDS IS UNKNOWN AND SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO AS IT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO TO BETTER TRACK. WELL THE MEDICAL BASS LINE PROGRAM THAT UTILITY COMPANIES CURRENTLY EMPLOYMENT ONLY SERVE A FRACTION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO LIKELY QUALIFY AND ARE ENROLLED WE MUST FIND WAYS TO REACH PEOPLE WHO ARE UNAWARE OF THOSE PROGRAMS EXISTENCE. EITHER THIS YEAR. SORRY EARLIER THIS YEAR SEE IF I'LL SEE ADMINISTERED A SHORT. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS SURVEY AND FOUND OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WHO COMPLETED IT 20% OF THEM HAD NEVER HEARD OF OR KNEW THAT THE MEDICAL BASELINE PROGRAM EXISTED. IN ADDITION TO THOSE FINDINGS WE ALSO FOUND THAT 50% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO TOOK OUR SURVEY USE OF MEDICAL ELECTRIC DEVICES BUT WERE HALF BUT ONLY HALF OF THEM WERE PREPARED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF PLAN IN PLACE OF THE POWER WERE TO BE SHUT OFF. SEE IF I'LL SEE WIDELY SHARED OUR SURVEY FINDINGS WITH PARTNER PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE FUNCTIONAL NEEDS AND THE IT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. IT WAS. THROUGH THOSE PRESENTATIONS THAT SEE IF I'LL SEE HAS APPROACH WAS APPROACH BY PGA NEED TO DEVELOP A ONE YEAR PILOT. THAT WOULD ASSIST INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS DURING POWER SHUT OFFS THE MEMBERS OF CA FILE SEED AGREED TO PROVIDE A LETTER OF SERVICES AND SUPPORT. HELLO SORRY PROVIDING A LETTER OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS DURING A SHUT OFF ALSO CONTINUING TO ADVOCATE FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. LIKE LEGISLATION ALTHOUGH A SIGNED CONTRACT HAS NOT BEEN EXECUTED SEE IF I'LL SEE MEMBERS HAVE RECEIVED RESOURCES FROM P. JEANNIE TO ASSIST DISABLED OLDER ADULTS WITH MEDICAL NECESSITIES THAT REQUIRE ELECTRICITY. DURING SHUT OFFS- I QUICKLY JUST WANT TO GO OVER THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE ASSISTING AND WATER CENTERS DID DURING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER- ARE CENTERS. WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT- TO TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHICH INCLUDED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED INCOMING TELEPHONE CALLS. FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY SERVED BY THE CENTERS. OVER AT HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS WERE PROVIDED TO FOLKS THAT COULD NOT JUST TAKE A BACKUP BATTERY IT NEEDED TO BE PUT INTO A HOTEL. ON A SHORT TERM BASIS BECAUSE A BACKUP BATTERY OR GENERATOR WOULD NOT BE A SOLUTION TO KEEPING AND I'M IN THEIR HOME FOR SEVERAL DAYS- WE DID HOWEVER PROVIDE OVER TWO HUNDRED BATTERIES TO INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR OWN HOMES- MOST OF THOSE USERS AS ELECTRICAL NEEDS- WERE C. PAP USERS BI PAP USERS. OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR MACHINES AS WELL AS POWER WHEELCHAIRS- WE HAD A LOT OF INSTANCES WHERE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT TELECOMMUNICATION EFFORTS GOING OUT. OF RANGE IN SERVICE IN SOME AREAS I JUST WANT TO BRING UP THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING- RELY ON THOSE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. AND IN SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE ABSOLUTELY. I KNOW WHERE THAT IS SHUT OFF WAS OCCURRING IN THEIR AREA. OUR MEMBERS CENTERS ALSO PROVIDED OVER FORTY INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION- OR GAS TO LEAVE THEIR HOME AND GET TO A CHARGING STATION OR HOTEL. IN NEW WHICH MANY CASES- WERE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE IT TOOK OVER AN HOUR TO GET FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. SEE IF I'LL SEE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT BATTERIES OR ANY OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE PROVIDED ARE THE SOLUTION THAT FITS ALL WE KNOW THROUGH TESTING BATTERIES IN ADVANCE THEY EVEN THE BEST BATTERY SYSTEMS WILL NOT SUSTAIN INDIVIDUALS WITH. DIVERSE ELECTRICAL MEDICAL DEVICE NEEDS I ALSO WANT TO BRING OUT THAT- WE HAVE ACTUALLY SATURATED ONE OF THE BATTERY COMPANIES. MARKETS AND THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE BATTERIES THAT ARE MOST USEFUL TO OUR COMMUNITY. IN THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR THEY SAID THAT THE FIRST BATTERIES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AGAIN IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT WAS- ARE THE BATTERIES THAT WE FOUND THAT. COULD HELP THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE- MOVING FORWARD I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. AS A PUBLIC POWER SAFETY SHUT OFF CAN BE AS- DEVASTATING BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ACCESSIBLE COMMUNITY CHARGING STATIONS WHICH OF ALL BROUGHT UP- AND THAT THOSE RESOURCES NEED TO BE PROVIDED BY TRUSTED INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES IN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDING SERVICES TO FOLKS WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS- WITH THAT SAID I WILL LET MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE SERVICES GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL. THANK YOU AND AGAIN I'M GONNA ASK EVERYONE TO TRY TO REPEAT THEIR COMMENTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE GIVEN OUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRISTINA BOSS HAMILTON I'M HERE REPRESENTING UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS YOU W. AFFECTS ME- WE REPRESENT A HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND I JUST US WORKERS IN TWENTY ONE COUNTIES INCLUDING MANY OF THE COUNTY'S IMPACTED. BY THE PS PS SO I'M GONNA MOVE QUICK ALSO. OUR MEMBERS ARE LOW INCOME WORKING POOR OR THEY ARE GENERALLY TAKING CARE OF OTHER LOW INCOME- MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS OF LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE FEEDBACK THAT I RECEIVED FROM OUR FOLKS IN THE FIELD IS- THESE ARE FOLKS WHO DO NOT HAVE MONEY TO PURCHASE- GENERATORS OR RENT GENERATORS OR EVEN THE GASOLINE TO USE GENERATORS- OR FOR THAT MATTER LANTERNS- WE HAD ANY. STORIES OF PEOPLE USING CANDLES TO LIGHT THEIR HOUSE AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY SOME FIRES RESULTING FROM THAT. WE HAD ISSUES WITH PEOPLE WHOSE- WATER COMES FROM WELLS WHICH RUN ON ELECTRICITY SO NOT ONLY AS YOU KNOW IS THE WATER- THE ELECTRICITY OUT BUT THE WATERS OUT AS WELL. LOTS OF CASES OF PEOPLE LOSING FOOD IN THEIR REFRIGERATORS AND IF YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THAT IS A DEVASTATING THING TO LOSE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FOOD- BECAUSE PHONE SERVICE WAS OUT FOR OUR MEMBERS. THE WERE IN SOME CASES PREVENTED FROM GOING TO WORK- BECAUSE EITHER THE CLIENT WAS NO LONGER AT THE HOME WHERE THEY- COULDN'T FIND WHERE THE CLIENT HAD BEEN EVACUATED TO. SO WE HAD- LOTS OF FOLKS WHO HAD LOST PAYCHECKS AS A RESULT. MOVING ON. THE ISSUE TRANSPORTATION HAS TO BE ADDRESSED IN MANY OF THESE PLACES INCLUDING THE RURAL AREAS THESE FOLKS DO NOT HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO EVEN GET. TO THE OPEN CHARGING FACILITIES AND I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AT ALL SO IF YOU AREN'T ABLE TO GET THERE- THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH I WAS TOLD OVER AND OVER THAT THE UNCERTAINTY. WAS A HUGE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE WARNINGS THAT ARE ISSUED ARE VERY LARGE AND THEY SAY YOU MAY YOU MAY HAVE YOUR SHOUT A POWER SHUT OFF. BUT IT'S UNCLEAR IF YOU WOULD HAVE IT SO THAT- PEOPLE WEREN'T SURE WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE IF THEIR POWER WAS SHUT OFF AND IT WAS ENTIRELY UNCLEAR WHEN IT WOULD GET RESTORED. OR AS IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED IT WOULD SAY ONE TIME BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT TIME IT WAS ANOTHER TIME. AND THEN WE'LL WE'RE- FINDING IS FOLKS WHO THEN BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING WORN BUT NEVER ACTUALLY HAD THEIR POWER SHUT OFF FOR NOW. DISREGARDING THE WARNINGS BECAUSE OF JUST A NATURAL INCLINATION TO NOT BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T APPLY TO THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE THAT YOU CAN TAKE FROM- WHAT MY COLLEAGUE CHRISTINA AND I HAVE THAT ARE SAYING IS THAT. FOR THE MOST PART THERE IS NOT ADEQUATE PREPARATION IN TERMS OF PEOPLE FOR MEDICALLY FRAGILE AND WHO HAVE A ACCESS FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. AND THE ADEQUATE MEASURES HAVE MOVE FOR THE MOST PART NOT BEEN TAKEN. THE STEPS THAT I WANT TO OFFER YOU IS THE LEGISLATURE. OR THAT. YOU SHOULD MANDATE IN LAW CLEAR RESPONSIBILITIES AND CLEARER MANDATES TO NOT ONLY THE UTILITIES BUT HEALTH PLANS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THAT THEY MUST WORK TOGETHER AND THEY MUST CORPS NAY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT A LOT OF THIS IS VERY AT HAWK. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT COUNTY YOU LIVE IN AND WHETHER OR NOT THE SERVICES. THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED OR OR OR HIGH QUALITY OR NOT IS REALLY AGAIN. JUST A QUESTION OF WHERE YOU LIVE AND WHAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP HAPPENS TO EXIST IN THE IN THAT LOCAL AREA. SO A LOT OF THIS TO ME IS A QUESTION OF MANDATES BY THE STATE. THAT REQUIRE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CLEAR DIRECTIVES TO EACH OF THESE AGENCIES- WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT. WHO WHO YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT IF AND I JUST AS WORKERS NOT GOING TO CHECK ON AND I JUST AS CLIENT. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO'S GOING TO DO THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FINGER POINTING WILL THAT PERSON HAS- THAT AGENCY HAS IT AND THAT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT HAPPENING. THAT'S NOT THE CASE. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT I JUST AS WORKERS ARE NOT PAID TO GO CHECK ON THEIR CLIENTS IN MANY CASES THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE AN OF MONEY TO PUT THE GAS IN THEIR CAR. TO GO GET TO THE CLIENT'S HOUSE TO CHECK ON THEM. THOSE SERVICES ARE NOT PAID BY THE STATE. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AUTHORIZED SERVICES SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT YOU. CONTEMPLATE A VERY EASY WAY TO AT LEAST PUT SOME EXTRA DOLLARS INTO PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS. IN CASES WHERE THERE ARE THESE PS PS IS OR WHERE THERE'S ACTUAL DISASTERS. CONSIDER EITHER CREATING SOME SORT OF. TIME CODE SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN SAY THAT YOU KNOW I WAS DOING SERVICES ABOVE AND BEYOND THE NORMAL COURSE BECAUSE I WAS CHECKING ON MY CREDIT WAS EVACUATING THEM ALWAYS SAVING THEIR LIFE. THINGS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT GETTING PAID FOR EONS OR JUST DO IT IN A BLANKET WAY WERE YOU GIVE. EVERY I JUST AS WORKER IN THAT DISTANT- IN THAT AREA JUST EX NUMBER OF DOLLARS IN ADDITION MAKE IT EASY YOU KNOW GIVE THEM. PAY THEM FOR FIVE EXTRA HOURS A WEEK WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT THAT EXTRA WORK. UTILITIES STATE COUNTIES HEALTH PLANS ALL NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME ON PREPARING FOR THIS SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES NEED NOT ONLY A PLAN A- PLAN B. AND EVEN A PLAN SEE. AND RELYING ON AUTOMATED MESSAGES TO WHOEVER MIGHT BE ON THE MEDICAL BASS LINE LIST IS ABSOLUTELY NOT ENOUGH. AND I WANT TO SAY WE BELIEVE UTILITY SHOULD BE PROVIDING MEAL VOUCHRS BATTERIES. ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION GAS VOUCHERS THAT SHOULD BE PAYING FOR LOST WAGES FOR I JUST AS WORKERS. THEY SHOULD BE PAYING FOR MONEY THAT PEOPLE LOSE WHEN THE REFRIGERATORS BREAK DOWN. ON THE SHOULD BE UP FRONT MONEY AND NOT FILING CLAIMS AND WAITING SIX MONTHS TO GET PAID IF YOUR- YOUR CLAIM IS APPROVED. WORKING PEOPLE SIMPLY CANNOT FRONT MONEY LIKE THIS AND WAIT FOR IT TO COME BACK TO THEM HOPEFULLY ONE DAY. IF THE GOOD FAITH EFFORT HAS TO BE IN MAKING THIS MONEY IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE WORKING FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY. TO WAIT MONTHS FOR THEIR MONEY TO COME BACK TO THAT THANK YOU. ONE LAST THING DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE STATE CAN ADD PROVISIONS TO MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACTS. TO ACTUALLY MAKE MANDATED RESPONSIBILITIES ON HEALTH PLANS DURING DISASTERS AND POWER OUTAGES. I COULD TALK ABOUT BACKUP SYSTEMS FOR. I'M SORRY I'M SO SORRY THAT WE'RE JUST I KNOW IT I I'M WELCOME TO IN TALK IN THE FUTURE THERE'S A LOT THAT THANK YOU AND WE'LL BE WORKING ON A LOT OF THE STUFF IN THE COMMITTEE FUTURE I'M SURE. AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE PART OF IT. THAT'S OKAY- WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE SURE YOUR COMMENTS TRACY MCBROOM. GOOD AFTERELTON NOW ICE OF HERS RAIN IT'S AFTER FIVE. AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO BE EQUALLY AS BRIEF- MY NAME IS TRACY MAKE ROOM AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FOR ADVENTIST HEALTH. CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS ON THE FRONT LINES OF EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS EVERY SINGLE DAY THE STUFF THAT GOES ON IN OUR HOSPITALS EACH DAY. BUT ALSO TO LARGE SCALE WILD FIRES THAT FORCED THE EVACUATION OF OUR HOSPITALS WE EXPERIENCE THAT OURSELVES DURING THE- CAMPFIRE. AS WELL AS PATIENTS SURGES DUE TO ACTIVE SHOOTERS TRANSPORTATION DISASTERS INFLUENZA AND NOW OUR GOOD FRIEND PS PS- HOSPITALS ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM PS PS. IN CASE ANYBODY WONDERED I AM WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME REALLY WELL VERSED IN EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS PARTLY BECAUSE IT HAPPENS A LOT IN OUR STATE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY- WE HAVE MANY TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO ALSO HELP WITH TRAIN AND PRACTICE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES OF OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS LIKE MANY THAT YOU'VE SEEN HERE TODAY LIKE CALLAWAY YES. SEVEN OF OUR ADVENTIST HOSPITALS AND IT IS HELD HOSPITALS AND NUMEROUS CLINICS WERE TALKING HNDREDS OF CLINICS ARE IMPACTED BY THE LAST ROUND OF P. S. P. S. AT THE END OF OCTOBER. AND JUST YESTERDAY WE WERE NOTIFIED THAT WE WOULD GO THROUGH IT AGAIN JUST EIGHTEEN DAYS FROM THE CLOSE OF THE LAST HOSPITAL RECEIVING THEIR POWER. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT TO DURING IT ONE OF THESE P. S. P. S. R. HOSPITALS GO THROUGH THE PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES OF MOVING AND NONESSENTIAL. APPOINTMENTS CANCER TREATMENTS AND SURGERIES TO OTHER DAYS. IN ADDITION TO MOVING MEDICATION SENSITIVE MEDICATIONS THE E. POWER OR EMERGENCY POWER AND ALSO STANDING UP THERE INCIDENT COMMAND CENTERS. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AN OUTAGE AND MAKE SURE WE CAN MOVE RESOURCES QUICKLY. MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS AND I'M ALSO HAD OUR EMPLOYEES WHO DO NOT HAVE POWER AT HOME THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PET OR HUMAN DAY CARE DURING THE DAY SO OUR HOSPITALS THEY NEED TO STAND UP THE ABILITY TO- HOW POWER AT AVAILABLE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE A PLACE TO SLEEP HAVE A PLACE TO SHOWER IN CASE EMPLOYEES NEED TO STAY. AT THE HOSPITAL ON THE JOB TO MAKE SURE WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR TO OUR- COMMUNITIES. BUT DURING THIS WHOLE TIME THESE LAST POWER OUTAGES WE AT NO TIME HAD TO SEND A HOSPITAL ON DIVERSION NOR DID WE HAVE TO LESSEN. THE AMOUNT OF SERVICE DELIVERY OR THE QUALITY OF THAT SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S DUE IN PART TO THE RESILIENT HOSPITAL STAFF WHO LIVED AT THE HOSPITAL. AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND THE FLEXIBILITY AS OF OUR HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO. TURN AND TURN THEMSELVES INTO BASICALLY EMPLOYEE SHELTERS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT THOSE HOSPITALS NEED TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. PS PS ARE UNIQUE IN THAT- WE CAN WE RESPOND TO DISASTERS EVERY DAY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER BUT THEY ARE UNIQUE I THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE HAPPENING BACK TO BACK- OFTEN FOR REALLY LONG DURATIONS OF TIME. ONE OF OUR HOSPITALS WAS ON PSP AS FOR NEARLY ELEVEN DAYS. OUR EMPLOYEES GOING FOR WITHOUT POWER FOR EVEN LONGER THAN THAT AND STILL ATTEMPTING TO COME TO WORK EVERY DAY. THEY'RE ALSO UNIQUE IN THAT THEY WERE NOT THE TRADITIONAL RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT WE TRAIN TO IS EMERGENCY MANAGERS A CALLOW YES TRAINS US ALL TO AN INCIDENT COMMAND AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. ARE NOT NECESSARILY AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME DURING THESE TYPES OF INCIDENCES THERE'S NOT THE SAME COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURE. THERE'S NOT LARGE TASK FORCES ASSEMBLED AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER LOOKING AT OUR HOSPITAL SURGES BEING MANAGED WHEN PEOPLE CALL NINE ONE ONE OR WHEN PEOPLE. PEOPLE END UP WITH NO OXYGEN AT HOME OR THEY HAVE NO WAY TO CHARGE THERE WILL TEAR BATTERIES THEY COME TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEY ASKED THE ET STAFF. TO HELP THEM GET A BATTERY OR HELP THEM CHARGE THEIR DEVICE OR FILTER OXYGEN TANKS. SO THEY COME TO US AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. AND THEN YOUR TRADITIONAL DISASTER. OUR UTILITY COMPANIES HAVE DEFINITELY MADE SOME PROGRESS FROM EACH OF THE DIFFERENT P. S. P. S. THAT WE'VE HAD WE'VE NOTICED THEY'VE MADE SOME CHANGES AND SOME DIFFERENCES BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE ABOUT INTEGRATION OF THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY AND OTHERS INTO THIS PROCESS AND ALIGNING WITH OUR STATE IS ALREADY DOING AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT REGENCY RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE AND WE'RE NOT USING IT FOR THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT THE WAY THAT WE DO FOR OTHERS. AND WE CAN ACHIEVE SIMILAR OUTCOMES. LASTLY I AM. A SCAB OVER AND LASTLY I THINK IT. OUR OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE HOSPITAL PREPAREDNESS GRANTS TO HARDEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS IN OUR HOSPITALS. AS YOU MAY KNOW NOT EVERY HOSPITAL HAS ENOUGH EMERGENCY POWER TO POWER THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL AND EVERYONE OF ITS CLINICS AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS TO HARD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE A CALLOW YES FORTY DOES VERY GOOD TODAY. TO INTEGRATE THIS PROCESS THROUGH WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING TODAY. THANK YOU. JIM CARD. MCCARTHY BUT CURRENTLY YES. IF TERM NÁN SENATORS- MY NAME IS JOE MCCARTHY ON THE OWNER OF THE FIFTY GRAND RESTAURANT AND BAR OPEN POLLOCK PINES- I THINK A LOT OF YOU KNOW THE AREAS HI HILL APPLE HILL SORRY NOT HIGH HEEL HIGH HEELS ONE OF THE. THE TO THE FARMS THAT ARE UP THERE ANYWAY- BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY- TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT MY BUSINESS EMPLOYEES- IN THE COMMUNITY THAT- WE BELONG TO- AND HOW THE CURRENT ROUND OF P. S. P. S. S. OF AFFECTED US- I HOPE THAT- MY COMMENTS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF MOST OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN RURAL AREAS- WE PURCHASED THE RESTAURANT. IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR- SO- HAVE HAD IT FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR THOUGH. IT HAS BEEN- CONTINUOUSLY RUNNING FOR LESS SEVENTY SIX YEARS- WE PERSISTED WE PURCHASED IT JUST IN TIME FOR WHAT WE LOVINGLY CALL SNOW MAY GET IN- THE RATHER BRUTAL FEBRUARY EXPERIENCED- BY MANY OF US LIVING IN THE SIERRAS. DURING THAT MONTH WE EXPERIENCED ROUGHLY TWELVE DAYS A POWER OUTAGE- NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE- HAVE JUST GONE THROUGH LATELY- WITH A PROLONGED POWER OUTAGES WE SAW. ELEVEN DAYS- IN OCTOBER- AS YOU'V ALREADY HEARD FROM OTHERS THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON BUSINESS HOURS IS. JUST ONE MORE OF THOSE- WHAT IS DIFFERENT THOUGH IS OUR CLOSEST TO THE OTHERS THAT WE- ARE ALSO IF THAT ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THIS. NOW WE ARE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GATHER AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND WE HEAR ABOUT. HOW PEOPLE ARE DEPRESSED AND STRESSED DURING TIMES LIKE THESE IN SOME WAYS IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. WE ARE PLACE FOR THEM TO VENT THEIR FRUSTRATIONS AND THEY OFTEN TALK ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO WORK BECAUSE THE COMPANY THEY WORK FOR. IT'S CLOSE TO THE POWER OUTAGE. THEY WONDER HOW. THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THE RENT FOR THE MONTH. NOW WHEN POWER GOES OUT MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS LOSE RUNNING WATER THEY NEED TO POWER. THEY NEED THEIR POWER FROM TEACHING YOU TO RUN THEIR WELL PUMPS OFTEN THE GENERATOR STARTS SUFFICIENTLY SIZED TO RUN THE LARGE ELECTRICAL DRAW FROM THE PUMPS. AND WE ARE- WE HAD ONE CUSTOMER THE CAME INTO A RESTAURANT IN TEARS. SHE ASKED IF SHE COULD GET WATER SO THAT SHE COULD WATER HORSES. FLUSH TOILETS AND HAVE WASTE WATER FOR BASIC HYGIENE. ALSO WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT COMCAST IS AS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY GOES OUT. AND IN MY BUSINESS WE USE COMCAST FOR PHONE. MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS DO AS WELL IN OUR COMMUNITY HAVE WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF RETIRED PERSONS. AND MEDICAL EMERGENCIES THEY LIVES THEIR FORM OF COMMUNICATION. NO I'VE I'VE BEEN BLESSED FOR MOST OF MY WORKING LIFE I'M A SOFTWARE ENGINEER- IT BY- PROFESSION- AND I HAVE A DEGREE IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO MAKE- AS MANY OF YOU DO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WITH RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO YOU WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT TIME YOU BARELY CONSIDERED INCONVENIENCED- TO GO OUT AND SPEND A THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A NEW GENERATOR- AT LEAST I KNOW I DID- FOR MANY OF MY CUSTOMERS THIS IS HARDLY COMPREHEND DOUBLE. FROM OF FOR THOSE MAKING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR A JENNER GENERATORS A SERIOUS EXPENSE TO BE CONSIDERED. AS A BUSINESS OWNER TO SOMETHING THAT I KNOW HAVE A FACT I HAVE TO FACTOR INTO HOW IT BUDGET EXPENSES FOR THE COMING YEAR. IN FEBRUARY WE LOST WERE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FOOD LOSSES. AND WE LOST ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TIE THE TIME THAT WE WERE CLOSED IN THE ABILITY TO GET PEOPLE THROUGH THE DOOR. DUE TO THE SNOW AND OTHER CLASSES. YOU KNOW AND THIS TIME- WE HAD. HI TWO GENERATORS RUNNING- AND- AS THINGS GO THE GENERATOR THAT WE HAD FIXED- ENDED UP GOING OUT IN THE FIELD RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF DINNER SERVICE FOR RETIREMENT- AND- AGAIN. NOW ANOTHER THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ANOTHER GENERATOR TO RUN- THE BUSINESS. THIS IS ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT WE HAD TO STAY AT WORK TILL MIDNIGHT TO RUN OUR GENERATORS LOCK UP GO HOME. TO A DARK HOUSE WAKE UP WITH A COLD SHOWER BECAUSE I. TOOK THE GENERATOR FROM MY HOME AND MOVED IT TO THE- RESTAURANT- AND TO GET THE GENERATOR STARTED UP AGAIN. SO AS THEY SAY WE WORK THE PROBLEM WE CAME SOLUTIONS OF COSTS. THE GAS RUNNING THE GENERATORS COST A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY. TO DAY RUNNING ON P. JEANNIE COST FORTY. AGAIN WHEN I WAS MAKING A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY BY MYSELF. AN EXTRA HUNDRED DOLLARS WOULD BE A BIG DEAL. WRAP UP IF YOU CAN YEAH OKAY- I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULT TO THE P. JEANNIE HOUSE- AND I FEEL THAT. P. JEANNIE HAS ITS WORK CUT OUT FOR IT- THIS IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO SOLVE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING PROGRESS WITH COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. MARK BURNHEIMER. THANK YOU JOURNALISM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- BARGAINING ROOM HERE REPRESENTING THE CINEMA VALLEY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND ACROSS STUFF HALF OF MY SPEECH CHILDREN MAKE THIS AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE PERSONAL I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE I DO WANT TO JUST PAUSE FOR A MOMENT RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT HALF OF THE STATE SENATE HALF OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THERE BEEN COMMUNITIES IN PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ALL OVER THE STATE THAT HAVE HAD TO STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR MONTHS. TO DEAL WITH THIS IT'S KIND OF INCREDIBLE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE BRAINPOWER IN THE MANNER RESOURCES THAT WE ARE ALL HAVING TO PUT INTO DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT. FROM THIS DECISION. I WANT TO THANK. MS MCCARTHY. SO MANY BUSINESSES LIKE HIM REALLY DID A LOT. TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES WHEN. THEY'RE WITH ANYBODY ELSE TO DO IT. HEARD SO MNY STORIES OF BUSINESSES THAT HAD AN EMPLOYEE RINGING A GENERATOR TO RUN A SHOP LIKE TO JUST. GIVE PEOPLE COPY SO THEY FELT LIKE A HUMAN IN THE MORNING. OR OR GAS STATION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD. A GENERATOR SO THEY WENT AND BOUGHT BUT IF THERE'S NO GAS STATION WITH ELECTRICITY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY GAS TO PUT INTO YOUR GENERATOR AND OBVIOUSLY THAT CAUSES A PROBLEM. SO SPECIFIC NUMBERS FIFTY NINE AND A HALF PERCENT OF CINEMA COUNTY LOST POWER FOR AT LEAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS. IN CINEMA VALLEY THAT NUMBER WAS EITHER A 100% EXACTLY OR VERY DARN CLOSE TO IT BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH OUR ENTIRE VALLEY WAS SHUT OFF BETWEEN OCTOBER EIGHTH AND ELEVENTH. THAT MEANS. FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH NO REFRIGERATION. NO POWER MEDICAL DEVICES NO ABILITY TO HEAT OR COOL THEIR HOMES SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE CENTERS CLOSE TRANSIT SYSTEMS HOSPITALS PHARMACIES BANKING SERVICES PET SUPPLIES GAS STATIONS. YOU NAME IT ALL THE THINGS THAT WE RELY ON WERE NOT THERE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES. THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER THE MOST WERE WITH LOW WAGE WAGE EARNERS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO REPORT TO WORK BECAUSE EITHER THEY DIDN'T HAVE CHILD CARE. OR BECAUSE THEIR JOB WAS CLOSED. THAT HAS A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON PEOPLE IN THE IN THE LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS. WE'LL TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT BUSINESSES ONE IS A SMALL. BURGER RESTAURANT THIS LOOK AT INVOICE HOT SPRINGS THEY JUST OPENED UP LAST SUMMER. IF YOU THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT TO DRILL DOWN BUT I WANT YOU TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR THEM. ON SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH WE GET THE FIRST WARNING IMPEDE PS PS IT DIDN'T OCCUR THAT MAY HAVE CREATED SOME FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY FOR THEM. ON OCTOBER FOURTH WE GET THE WARNING FOR THE SECOND EVENT AND IT TURNED INTO THE LARGE OUTAGE THAT. TOOK OUT OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY. ON OCTOBER NINTH EXCUSE ME THAT WAS THE THAT ONE SOMETIME OVER THAT WE CAN THE GOT THEIR POWER BACK BUT IT WAS A TOTAL LOSS ALL OF THEIR INVENTORY FOR THIS RESTAURANT HAD TO BE THROWN OUT I'LL LET YOU GUYS ALL THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD DO WITH HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF GROUND MEAT AND BEEN REFRIGERATOR TO YOUR HOUSE IT'S A BIG PROBLEM JUST GETTING RID. OF THE MESS THAT WAS CREATED. FINALLY GOT BACK UP AND RUNNING. AFTER A WEEK IT TOOK THEM ANOTHER FULL WEEK TO GET THE- DELIVERIES BECAUSE THE DISTRIBUTORS WEREN'T ABLE TO SERVICE ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS BECAUSE EITHER THEY WERE SHUT DOWN. TO THE OUTAGE OR BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH DEMAND FOR RESTOCKING EVERYTHING A RESTAURANT ACROSS ALL OF. CINEMA COUNTY. HOW ON OCTOBER TWENTY THIRD THE POWER DID NOT GO OUT AGAIN FOR THE BUSINESS BUT MANY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES DID LOSE POWER AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR STAFF THERE TO. TO WORK ON THE TWENTY SIX THEY LOST POWER AGAIN FOR A FEW DAYS. EVEN WHEN THEY WERE ABLE TO RESTOCK THEIR BUSINESS THEY COULDN'T. GET A FULL. DELIVERY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. THROUGH LOSING OF ALL OF THAT INVENTORY AGAIN AND AGAIN SO THEY WERE SHORTING THEIR ORDERS AND THAT CREATED NEW PROBLEMS BEING ABLE TO DELIVER WHAT THE CUSTOMERS WERE EXPECTING. TO THE MAIN THING THAT I WANT TO CONVEY IS. A FORTY EIGHT HOUR OUTAGE IS NOT FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM STARTS AND WE GET THE WARNING. AND WHEN EVERYTHING IS THROWN INTO CHAOS AND UNCERTAINTY. AND IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL A BUSINESS HAS ALL OF THEIR NORMAL OPERATIONS BACK UP AND RUNNING WHICH CAN BE DAYS WEEKS. AFTER THE ACTUAL OUTAGES TURN BACK ON. SECOND BUSINESS I WANT TO MENTION IS THE ONLY HOTEL. THERE IN GLEN ELLYN. THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT WAS HIT VERY HARD BY THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRE AND THERE'S FRANKLY STILL IN THE RECOVERY MODE. THE LA HOTEL LAS PART OF THEIR PROPERTY AND THEY WERE SHUT DOWN FOR A YEAR. AFTER THE FIRES. IT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL RIBBON CUTTINGS. BUT I DID OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- THING ABOUT. LITERALLY RISE FROM THE ASHES AND COME BACK LAST YEAR WAS JUST SO AMAZING. AND SO WHEN I GOT THE EMAILS TODAY. HE'S TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS THE- Là YOUNG. LOCAL FAMILY IN SOME OF. THE ROUTE THIS MAYBE TEN FOURTEEN ROOMS IS NOT A BIG OPERATION. THIS CUSTOM FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DIRECT LOSSES. THAT'S JUST CANCELED RESERVATIONS FOOD SPOILAGE. THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR. LOST WAGES FOR EMPLOYEES CANCELLATIONS OF FUTURE BOOKINGS. THE MARKETING THAT THEY MEAN THEY SPENT ON- MARKETING OCTOBER AND SEPTEMBER OR BASIS MONTHS. AND IT IS ONE READ THE WORDS THAT HE WROTE. HE SAID WERE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO CATCH UP TO OUR NORMAL OPERATIONS MARKETING THE SLOW SEASON TAX PREPARATION BUILDING NEW PARTNERSHIPS ETCETERA. WE ARE PRACTICALLY CRUMBLING FROM AN OPERATIONS WHEN IF YOU. AND THE AND THIS IS HAPPENING BUSINESSES ALL OVER THE STATE IT'S NOT JUST US. THE AND THE AND IT'S FRANKLY IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE SO WE HOPE THAT YOU GET TO MAKE SOME CHANGES- I DO WANT TO- JUST TOUCH REAL QUICKLY ON THE NUMBERS BECAUSE A COUPLE OF YOU'D MENTIONED- HARD NUMBERS. ARE COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD WORK WITH MOODY'S ANALYTICS THEY'RE ESTIMATING A FIFTY TO SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR IMPACT FOR JUST CINEMA COUNTY FOR JUST THE OCTOBER EIGHTH THROUGH ELEVENTH EVENT. SO YOU CAN MULTIPLY THAT BY THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT HAD THE OTHER EVENTS AND THE LONGER OUTAGES AND- AND KIND OF GO FROM THERE SO- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING TO US TODAY WE REALLY DEMAND BETTER FROM. JENNY I THINK THAT THEY HAVE MADE BASS IMPROVEMENTS FROM THE FIRST EPISODE TO THE SECOND ONE I SAW A BIG DIFFERENCES BUT BOY WE NEED A WHOLE LOT MORE OUR GOVERNOR BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT WHERE IN THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED STATE IN THE NATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I LIKE TO ASK THE NEXT PANEL SHOP OF CONTINUING ON THE- BUSINESS CONCEPT WE'RE GONNA HAVE. ANDREW CHAIN IS A CHAIN. SHANE HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNOR FAIR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR FOOD BANKS. CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. AND IF WE COULD ALSO ASK OF US THE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE SCHOOLS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CORY WILL IN BURKE ERIN MCALLISTER. CHRISTOPHER GODLY AND CARMEL ANGELO TO COME FORWARD AS WELL- MISTER MISTER CHENEY. CHAIN MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS INTERCHANGE ARE PRESENTING THE FORTY ON FOOD BANKS ACROSS THE STATE WHO SERVE ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. OUR MISSION IS DONE HUNGER IN CALIFORNIA- THE PS PS BROUGHT SEVERAL LAYERS OF IMPACT. STRESSING COMMUNITY CONFUSION A SETBACK THAT MISSION- BUT FOR CONTEXT OWN ADDRESS THE POPULAR PERCEPTION THAT WE RECENTLY HEARD. THAT TRIPLE PROVIDERS LIKE FOOD BANKS ARE UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN NEED. PEOPLE CAN SIMPLY COME TO US IN A FILTER FOR REFRIGERATORS- AS INCREDIBLE AS OUR NETWORK SERVICES. CALIFORNIANS MISS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MEALS MILLION MEALS ANNUALLY PARTICULARLY CHILDREN. OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE DISABILITIES ANOTHER ANIMAL HOUSEHOLDS. TO EVEN DURING NORMAL TIMES FOOD BANKS ARE UNDER RESOURCE NONPROFITS THAT RELYING DONATED FOOD. AND VOLUNTEER LABOR TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. PEOPLE TRYING TO STRETCH THEIR HOUSEHOLD BUDGET TO MAKE THEIR FAMILY. AND 70% OF PEOPLE WHO VISIT THE BANKS REPORTS GIVING US TO PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS THE LIGHTS ON AND THEIR HOMES CALLING SOMEONE WOMAN WINNER. TO THE SHOULD US NOT ONLY TAXED OUR NETWORK THE DEMON HUNGER AMONG THOSE ALREADY FOOD AND SECURE. WHAT CREATING ANOTHER TEAR PEOPLE WITH UNPLANNED FOOD LAWSON HARDSHIP TO SIMPLY PUT. WE CANNOT BE THERE FOR EVERYONE IN NEED AND CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT REVEALING THOSE REFRIGERATORS. SO IN TERMS OF DIRECT IMPACT OUR FOOD BANKS AND HERE PRECISE DATA CAN BE DIFFICULT TO COME BY BECAUSE THEY DON'T ASK QUESTIONS AS A EMERGENCY FOOD SERVICE PROVIDER. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND OTHERS IN THIS KIND OF FEAR. BUT IN TERMS OF FOOD LOS DEGREES OCCURRED IN HUMBLE COUNTY WHERE THE ENTIRE COUNTY WAS DE ENERGIZED SO NOT ONLY TO THE FOOD BANK FOOD FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING A FOOD LOS SO TO THE- TO THE GROCERY STORES SO WHERE PEOPLE EXPECTED TO GO. TO REFILL IS REFRIGERATORS ESPECIALLY A FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILE COUNTY YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TIME AND EXPENSE AGAIN LIKE MISS BEST HAMILTON SAID EARLIER SINGULAR EVEN OF THE MONEY TO DO THIS- JUST REPLACE THOSE WHO SUCKS. LITTLE PEOPLE WHO WENT WITHOUT. IN CINEMA COUNTY I THINK WE JUST HEARD- ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE IMPACT BUT THE RED EMPIRE FOOD BANK WAS IN THE MANDATORY EVACUATION ZONE SO THE COMBINATION OF T. S. P. S. AND KINCAID FIRE. INTO THAT THE MOMENT THAT THE STAFF AND THE PEOPLE WE NEED TO THE INSTITUTION THE MOST THEY COULD EVEN ACCESS THE WAREHOUSE RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS A PUBLIC SAFETY SITUATION BUT IS TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT OUR NETWORK IS TRYING TO DO. TO FEED PEOPLE OKAY AND PARTICULARLY THEIR SISTER INSTITUTIONS SO THERE ARE AND WILL USE IN PLACE WITH THE NAPA VALLEY FOOD BANK IN OTHERS. BUT THEY TOO WERE STRUGGLING TO FEED PEOPLE EVACUATE THE FIRES AND THEN- HAVING THE THERE IF SOMEBODY SHUT DOWN- DO THAT TO THE PS PS RIGHT SO THOSE MO USE BRINGING IN MUTUAL AID SIMPLY CAN'T WORK IN A WIDE SPREAD. DISASTER LIKE THE PS CASTRATO- AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE FROM SOME OF THE THAT WE WERE WE WERE ABLE TO GET. THE SHASTA SENIORS AND READ ABOUT THE READING THEY SAW ALMOST A 23% INCREASE IN THEIR SERVICE LEVELS LIKE THAT ARE SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE FOR FOOD BANKS THAT ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO ANYTHING IN THE COMMUNITIES. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE SHOTS. ARE OBVIOUSLY LESS SEVERE. APPROVING SET THE SCENE TO GO FOOD BANK. AND THERE'S TERRITORY WHICH CREATED CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT FOOD RESOURCES WERE AVAILABLE. AND THEY ALSO DID NOT GIVEACT YOUR COMMUNICATION TO THE BOW ADDS. ABOUT WHAT FOOD IS NEEDED AT THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS. SO IT'S GOING TO ADD ABOUT THE NEED TO IMPROVE THAT KIND OF COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION. WITH CAN RESOURCE CENTERS- BUT BEYOND THE IMPACT OUR NETWORK IS TO THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT WE STRIVE TO SERVE- AND THERE ARE TOO MANY STORIES TO SHARE BUT- BUT SOME JUST VERY QUICKLY. THERE WERE SENIOR AND NAPA. A PARAPLEGIC OLDER ADULTS STRAPPED TO THEIR CHAIR. WHO IS STUCK IN THE AUTOMATED CHAIR AND TO LOOK FOR MAKING THEIR NETWORK OF VOLUNTEERS ARE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEIR SON TOOK ABOUT BATTERY. TO ACTIVATE THAT CHAIR ALRIGHT SO THE FOOD BANKS ARE GOING THE EXTRA MILE WHEN THEY'RE ABLE BUT OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T WE CAN'T GET TO EVERYONE AS WE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL. AT FROM THE SAINTLY WAS CHURCH IN CINEMA- WE KNOW THAT OLDER ADULTS HAD A THROAT MILK. GROCERIES I'M SORRY CITY GREENS FISH. AND OTHER PERISHABLES THAT THEY WERE SIMPLY NOT ABLE TO REPLACE BECAUSE FOR BANKS DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF STOCK N HAND. SO I WANT TO GIVE- MUCH THANKS TO CSS WE HEAR FROM THE SECRETARY GOLLY EARLIER. BUT THERE IS NO STATE FLEXIBLE FOOD RESOURCE AVAILABLE AND FEDERAL AID IS LIMITED AS IS. THIS WAS NOT A PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTER. WHILE CSS IS AFTER THE MAXIMUM LEXIBILITY. FOR A PLACE TO BENEFITS OF CALIFORNIA. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE STATE'S COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT. TRYING TO GET THE COMMUNICATION OUT WE SAW IT ON THE- RESPONSE WEBSITE. AND THAT WAS IN SEVERAL THE GOVERNOR'S COMMUNICATIONS. IT'S UNDER USTA'S RULES THAT YOU CANNOT REPLACE BENEFITS WHAT WOULD WAY THROUGH THE MASS REPLACEMENT FEATURE MEANING THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE REQUESTED. ON A ONE OFF BASIS- BECAUSE IT THE REMOTE WILL POWER SHUT UP IN THE SAME MONTH. WELL IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE FAULT OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE AT THEIR- THE LOS FOOD TWICE IN THE SAME MONTH. AND WE CAN'T USE THAT MASS REPLACEMENT METHOD WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT. TO DELIVER THAT BENEFIT AUTOMATICALLY- ANSWER THAT ONE OF OUT REACH WELL WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN WE APPRECIATE THE STATE. A SUPPORT. WE KNOW THAT ALWAYS FALL SHORT. SO WHAT CAN BE DONE. I WANT TO QUICKLY SAY THAT AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN. BY THEN SOME WOMEN BRADFORD HAS NOT BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED TO TRY AND FIGHT UTILITY REALLY TO FOOD BANKS. AND ULTIMATELY THE P. S. P. S. EPISODES HAVE UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR BACKUP POWER GENERATION. AND FLEXIBLE SOURCES OF THE FINNISH FOOD. TO SUPPLEMENT THE KEY DONATIONS THAT TO MAKE CAN MAINTAIN SERVICE WHEN COMMUNITIES. IN ITS MOST. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER WOLENBERG. BELIEVE ME MY NAME IS DOCTOR COREY WOLENBERG AND I'M THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE ORACLE UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT MY DISTRICT HAS A NINE TWELVE ENROLLMENT OF DISTRICT ENCOMPASSES APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY THREE SQUARE MILES- YOU HST HAS TWO COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOLS OR HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS PLUMAS HIGH ONE CONTINUATION SCHOOL PROSPECT HIGH ONE COMMUNITY DAY SCHOOL AND ADULT EDUCATION CENTER 77% OF MY STUDENTS ARE SOCIAL ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. MY STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES RELY ON MY SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS PROVIDE TWO MEALS A DAY ONE OF MY SCHOOL OUGHT SCHOOLS OFFER STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY THREE MEALS A DAY. WHEN SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED IT CREATES AN ISSUES FOR FAMILIES. THERE WITHOUT A SAFE PLACE AND THEY ARE WITHOUT FOOD. ON NINE TWENTY FIVE THE ENTIRE WARBLE ADULT EDUCATION CENTER IN CHICO AND OR OF A LOST POWER FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. AND ALSO A PORTION OF OUR BILL HIGH SCHOOL LOST POWER IT WAS A HUNDRED TWO DEGREES. AS AND WE STAYED IN SESSION AND MOVE STUDENTS TO COLDER COOLER CLASSROOMS. ORVILLE ADULT ARE OR OF A HIGH BUT WE CANCELED OUR ADULT EDUCATION CLASSES. THE INTERNET FOR THE ENTIRE DISTRICT IS HOUSE ADORABLE DOLL WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE INTERNET UP AND RUNNING BY HOOKING IT UP TO A GENERATOR. ON TEN NINE LOS PLUMES HIGH SCHOOL LOST POWER FOR THE DAY WE HAD TO PURCHASE A GENERATOR TO POWER UP THE PHONES. AND PURCHASE A GENERATOR. FOR THE WALK IN REFRIGERATOR FREEZER AUSTIN'S HIGH. YOU HST SUFFERED FINANCIAL SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AS A DIRECT RESULT OF P. GENIES DECISION TO CUT POWER. EVERY DAY THAT I CANCEL SCHOOL- YOU HST LOSES A HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. RATHER THAN CLOSE SCHOOLS AND DEPRIVE STUDENTS TO SAFETY AND MEALS WE SPENT A PROXY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GENERATORS FUEL LANTERNS AN EXTRA HELP THAT MONEY CAME OUT OF MY GENERAL FUND THAT IS NOW NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO PUT TOWARD STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. HOWEVER IT WOULD BE NOTED THAT WITHOUT PROPER POWER MANY OF OUR SAFETY FEATURES PHONES BELLS FIRE ALARMS SMOKE DETECTORS WERE INOPERABLE. ANOTHER REASON I DID NOT CLOSE SCHOOLS THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF BEING GRANTED A J. THIRTEEN A WAIVER FROM THE- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ESPECIALLY WHEN SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN IS ISSUING STATEMENTS ENCOURAGING SCHOOLS TO MAKE IT WORK WITHOUT POWER AND OFFERING SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO DO SO. AT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE STATE MUCH FOR DAILY ACTIVITIES ARE TECHNOLOGY BASED WITHOUT ELECTRICITY MY STAFF IS UNABLE TO PERFORM DAILY DUTIES. TEACHERS WERE UNABLE TO PROPERLY DELIVER LESSONS AND STUDENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO PERFORM TASKS WE USE AN ATO COLOR AND SOCIAL MEDIA AS A WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PARENTS AND THE COMMUNITY. WITHOUT POWER THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. ADDITIONALLY GIVEN THAT MANY OF THE OUTAGES ARE HAPPENING A RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. EVEN IF WE HAD POWER TO DELIVER MESSAGES RESIDENTS ARE WITHOUT POWER TO RECEIVE THEM. ALS MANY MY TEACHERS AND STAFF ARE ALSO IMPACTED BY THE SHUT OFFS. ARE WITHOUT POWER AND SOMETIMES WATER. THEY LIKE MANY OF MY STUDENTS ARE UNABLE TO SHOWER. DO LAUNDRY INFILL BASIC HUMAN TASKS WE HAVE ALL COME ACCUSTOMED TO. P. GENIE IS AGAIN WARNING OF ANOTHER POSSIBLE SHUT OFF LATER THIS WEEK ONCE AGAIN I'M HAVING TO DECIDE IF WE NEED TO CLOSE MY SCHOOLS. AND DEPRIVE MY STUDENTS TO SAFETY AND FOOD OR HOLD SCHOOL KNOWING MY TEACHERS AND STAFF ARE NOT ABLE TO FILL THEIR DUTIES AS THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO. ALL THE WHILE I'M WHEN THE PROS AND CONS MAKING SURE SAFETY IS UPHELD. KNOWING THAT WITHOUT POWER SAFETY IS IN FACT COMPROMISED. AS SUPERINTENDENT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THE STUDENTS RECEIVE AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION. TO TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOL ARE FED WHILE AT SCHOOL IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. PLANNED OUT OF POWER OUTAGES TO WORK MY JOB. I BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY FOR P. JEANNIE TO LIMIT LIABILITY AND JUST FLIPPING THE SWITCH FOR SELECTED AREAS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY THANK YOU. KERN MCALLISTER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- ERR MCALLISTER WITH THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FIRE DISTRICT AND I SERVICE THE DEPUTY FIRE CHIEF- MY COMMENTS TODAY REPRESENT BOTH THE DISTRICT AND THOSE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND WERE THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH STATE LOCAL AGENCIES. TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. BUT WHEN THE CONCEPT OF PS PS FIRST CAME ABOUT- WERE NOT PERFECT WE LOOKED INTERNALLY WE LOOKED AT OUR OWN LEVELS OF PREPAREDNESS WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION WE HAVE OLDER FIRE STATIONS NOT ALL OF WHICH HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS- THOSE THAT HAVE SOME GENERATORS DON'T POWER THE ENTIRE FACILITY SO- WE DID OUR OWN RISK ASSESSMENT. AND FOUND OUT SOME OF OUR GAPS WITH AN ORGANIZATION. AND WE MADE SOME IMMEDIATE CHANGES IN ORDER TO FILL THOSE GAPS WE WEREN'T ABLE TO FILL ALL OF THEM BUT WE DID- INSTALL TRANSFER SWITCHES WE- REINFORCED OUR CONTRACTS WITH FUEL AND EMERGENCY GENERATORS. AND WE PLANNED FOR- ROUND THE CLOCK SERVICES IN ORDER TO GET FUEL NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS. WE DID IDENTIFY GAP IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO SYSTEM WHERE- WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR GENERATOR AT ONE LOCATION IN OUR COUNTY. AND WE CONDUCT A PUBLIC EDUCATION- PRODUCED A CITIZEN'S GUIDE AND IT OUT REACH WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. WE DEVELOPED A PLAN- AND ONCE WE ARE GOING INTO  P. S. P. S. EVENT WE ACTIVATED THAT PLAN NOW SEVERAL TIMES. INCLUDING TWICE IN OCTOBER- WE ACTIVATE THE FIRE DISTRICT DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTER WE HOLD OPERATIONAL AREA CONFERENCE CALLS WITH ALL THE PARTNERS ALL OF THESE THINGS GOING TO MOTION. AND THERE AGAIN IN MOTION THIS WEEK IS WERE PREPARING FOR ANOTHER EVENT. THE COUNTY- SEE IS ACTIVATED- AND THIS IS A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN OPERATION THIS IS NOT MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY EIGHT TO FIVE SO IT'S AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN THAT'S PLACED. ON OUR AGENCIES AND OTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AS WELL. CONTRA COSTA FIRE SEN FIRE INSPECTORS TO NURSING FACILITIES AND- SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES. AND WE FOUND THE MOST WERE. ILL PREPARED OR NOT INFORMED OF THE EVENT. AND IT'S NOT LOST ON ME I HEARD THE TESTIMONY TODAY THAT- HSS TO TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF OUT REACH- AS DID THE STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS IN HSS. AND THOSE CAPPED PATIENTS FROM BEING DIVERTED INTO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM SO I APPRECIATE THEIR WORK THAT WAS VALUABLE AND IMPORTANT WORK THAT OCCURRED. ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS WE NEED IN A P. S. P. S. EVENT IS INFORMATION. TIMELY INFORMATION ACCURATE INFORMATION- WE GET BROAD BRUSH MAPS IN P. JEANNIE HAS MADE IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF EVENTS BUT BROAD BRUSH MAPS. SHOW THAT WE'RE GONNA SHUT DOWN TRAUMA CENTERS JAILS FIRE STATIONS AND THE OMMUNITY ROSS MORE WHICH IS TO HIM THOUSAND SENIORS THAT LIVE IN THE WALNUT CREEK COMMUNITY. AND IT'S NOT UNTIL TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS INTO THE WARNING TIME THAT WE LEARN THOSE ARE NOT IN THE SHUTDOWN ZONES SO ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO LOCAL OFFICIALS. DURING THE FIRST OCTOBER EVENT WE HAD POWER DISCONNECTED TORE NINE ONE ONE COMMUNICATIONS CENTER AND WE WORKED ON THREE DAYS WITH EMERGENCY POWER. THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR US- WE INSTALLED A BACK UP TO THE BACK UP GOT A PORTABLE GENERATOR INSTALLED A TRANSFER SWITCH SO THAT WE HAD A BACK UP. IT IT'S ON FALLIBLE TO THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA LOSE POWER IN OUR NINE ONE ONE CENTER. WE WENT INTO THE FIRST EVENT AND MORAGA. BALKED OVER NINE TO ELEVEN WE HAD A FIRE THREATENING DOZENS OF HOMES AND MORAGA- WE HEARD IT PREVIOUSLY HERE TODAY BUT THE PRE POSITIONING OF ASSETS AND FIRE RESOURCES. WAS SO IMPORTANT TO THAT OPERATION SAVING THOSE HOMES WE THOUGHT THAT WAS GONNA BE THE HEADLINER BUT WE WENT INTO THE LATER OCTOBER EVENT- AND WE SAW. A SIEGE OF FIRE ACTIVITY IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND AGAIN FOR THE PRE POSITIONING OF FIRE RESOURCES- BOTH IN OUR COUNTY AND RELYING THOSE ON THE NEIGHBORING COUNTIES WE KEPT THAT FROM BECOMING A CATASTROPHIC EVENT. BUT THEN AGAIN WE SAW THE COLD WEATHER. AND ALL OF. OUR WRAP WITH THIS. OUT ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL THINGS AFFECTING US CURRENTLY IS HAVING REAL TIME INFORMATION ON CELL TOWERS HOW MANY ARE OUT. IT'S NOT UNTIL AFTER THE EVENT THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT WE HAD EIGHTY EIGHT TOWERS DOWN A 12% DEGRADATION IN OUR COUNTY. AND THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T COMMUNICATE WITH INCIDENT COMMANDERS THEY COULD COMMUNICATE WITH THE DISPATCH CENTERS. AND WE COULDN'T DELIVER EVACUATION WARNINGS TO RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THOSE CELL TOWERS WERE DOWN WE DON'T GET THAT UNTIL AFTER THE FACT AND HAVINGTHAT INFORMATION REAL TIME. CHANGES OUR STRATEGY AND TACTICS ON THE FIRE GROUND THAT'S CRITICAL INFORMATION THAT LOCALS HAVE TO HAVE. LASTLY THERE'S A COST- MY ORGANIZATION SPENDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER EVENT FOR ADDITIONAL AMBULANCE STAFFING TO HANDLE THE ADDITIONAL NINE ONE ONE TRAFFIC. THERE'S A COST TO THE FIRE AGENCIES AS WE ADD RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT JUST FOR THE FIRE RESCUE BUT IS THERE BUT FOR THE PSP ASSESSMENT. AND I THINK YOU OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU AND RUN ON THE WORST EVENTS. IN OUR SOCIETY- AFFECT US. FIREFIGHTERS OF THE FIRST THERE SO WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE ALL THE FIREFIGHTERS YOU DIRECT. CHRISTOPHER GLADLY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE THE COUNTY SNOWED LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND COMMEND YOU ON YOUR INSURANCE FOR TODAY'S HEARING ON I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THAT TOMORROW I'LL BE IN MY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER FOR THE SIXTH TIME THIS YEAR DUE TO DE ENERGIZE ATION. IT'S THE FIFTY IN JUST THE LAST EIGHT WEEKS AND SO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO WRAP UP AGAIN AND DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES I WILL MENTION THAT THIS IS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT IN OUR COMMUNITY REGARDING THE GENERALIZATION SIDE UP AND DOWN THAT BUSINESSES ECONOMIC IMPACTS THE CYCLE AND SOCIAL STRESSES IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE CUMULATIVE NOW WE MAY GET A BREAK HOPEFULLY THIS WINTER BUT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU IT IS PRODUCING STRAIN AND STRUGGLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. I WILL. ECHO THE EARLIER COMMENTS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS WE HAD A FIRE. WE BROKE OF FIRING THE MIDDLE THIS THING HI LILY DROVE UP TO THE FIRE THAT NIGHT TWO HOURS INTO IT I STARTED THAT FIRE COMING DOWN THE HILL. KNOWING THAT I COULD NOT WORN MY COMMUNITY. THAT MY COMMUNITY COULD NOT RECEIVE MY PHONE CALLS MY CABLE MESSAGES. I COULD NOT REACH THEM. AND SO WE USE HIGH LOW SIRENS ENSURE SQUAD CARS WE USE NO WEATHER RADIO WE USED ALL THESE ALTERED SYSTEMS WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR LAST YEAR'S WE KNEW. THAT WAS NOT AS JUST AS EFFECTIVE. AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE POWER BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. HE WAS LITERALLY FIGHTING THIS FIRE WITH ONE HAND TIED BEHIND OUR BACK. WE CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH OUR COMMUNITY WE CANNOT OPEN SHELTERS TRAFFIC SIGNALS ROUTE WE EVACUATED. HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHICH IN THE DARK WITHOUT COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT TRAFFIC LIGHTS. IT'S STUNNING TO ME THAT WE DIDN'T KILL PEOPLE DURING THAT EVENT. SO GENERALIZATION RADICALLY IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE ACTUAL FIRE VENTURE TO OCCUR. AND IT FOR THE AXIS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS COMMUNITY THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR US. AS WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY LIVE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE THERE ARE LIMITED RESOURCES I CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR. FOR MANY THESE PEOPLE AND I HEARD UTILITIES I WHO'S YOUR EARLIER TALK ABOUT HARDSHIP AND CAN BE IT'S NOT IT'S LIFE OR DEATH. AT SOME POINT WE ARE GONNA KILL PEOPLE WE HAD A BROKEN BACK IN ONE EVENT WE HAD ONE MAN BURKE HIMSELF ON A GENERAL ELECTRICALLY THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE INTO A POINT WHERE PEOPLE GET COMPLACENT AND THEN WE'RE GONNA START SEEING TESTS. AS THE COMMUNITY NO LONGER SURGES RESPONSABLES THEIR MOST MOBILE BUT JUST TAKES IT IS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THERE COULD BE TAKEN CARE OF. AND THEN FINALLY MONEY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT'S US THAT ARE OUT THERE MEETING THE NEEDS ANSWERING AND I ONE CALLS TRYING TO PROVIDE SHELTER EVACUATING PEOPLE. WE LOSE REVENUE YOU HEARD AT FIFTY TO SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR ECONOMIC KIT FOR ONE EVENT. WELL A PERCENTAGE THAT GOES TO FUND LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU TAKE AWAY THAT PERCENTAGE. THAT'S CAN IMPACT US AND SAID CONSUMER COUNTY. WERE ALREADY ON THE ROPES FROM THE FIRES TWO YEARS AGO WERE LAYING OFF STAFF. TO PAY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES AND MISSIONS WERE PAYING. FOR WIRING OUR BUILDINGS AT A GENERAL FUND MONIES SHOULD BE GOING TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER FUNCTIONS. THERE ARE SOFT COSTS ON HERE TODAY MY STAFF WILL BE IN THE IDEAS YOU FOR NEXT THREE DAYS. WE'RE TAKING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF EMPLOYEES AWAY FROM THE NORMAL DUTIES ON A REGULAR BASIS. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STAFF HOURS ARE NO LONGER BEING DIRECTED TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY OF THE MISSIONS ARE ALREADY OUT IN FRONT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WERE RESPONDING TO BUT WHAT'S BASICALLY A MAN MADE DISASTER. A BUREAUCRATIC DISASTER WHAT'S CAUSING THIS CHALLENGE FOR US. THAT FINALLY THERE ARE HARD COSTS WERE SPEND REAL MONEY ON THIS. STAFF OVER TIME RESPONSE COSTS FOR SUPPLIES. THE ESTIMATES. PRIOR TO THE EVENT FROM LAST WEEK WE'RE FOR HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COSTS IS FROM ACCOUNTING. THAT'S GENERAL FUND IT'S NOT CAN BE REPLACED. IS GONNA BE REAL HARD FOR US TO CATCH UP THAT WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING ADDITIONAL STAFF IMPACTS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. AND I WOULD. LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE GRANTS THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE STATE KICKED AND THAT'S GREAT HALF OF IT GOES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SOMEONE COUNTY WILL SEE FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S OUR WARD. THAT'S IT. FOR POPULATION OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE I CAN BUY TO MOBILE GENERATORS. IT'S NOT A TENT IF YOU WANNA MAKE A DENNIS SAYING AND IT'S GOING TO GO ON FOR YEARS. WE NEED TO SEE REAL MONEY COMING OUT OF THE I USED A NEED TO PULL. THEY NEED TO PAY FULL FREIGHT. FOR THESE COSTS WE'RE TALKING SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. NEED. TO GO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO REALLY BEEF UP THE SOCIAL. SIX SAFETY NETWORKS THEY'RE GONNA PROVIDE THAT. A SICKLY THAT'S SECURITY BLANKET FOR COMMITTEE POLITICS YEARS FOR THEM TO GET THEIR NETWORKS PUT TOGETHER PROPERLY THANK YOU. CAMANCHE LOW HERE CARMEL ANGELO MENDOCINO COUNTY CEO AND ALSO INCOMING PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY EXECUTIVES. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK I ALSO SUBMITTED TO YOU A LETTER THAT CAME FROM MY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE CHAIR BROWN TO THE- TO PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. ALONG WITH THE CHART THAT'S MARKED INTERNAL DRAFTED THIS IS A CHART OF CALLS WE OPENED A COMPLAINT LINE FOR OUR RESIDENTS TO CALL AND IF THEY HAD A NEED OR JUST TO CALL AND LET US KNOW WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE WAS. YOU'LL SEE YOUR DOCUMENT IN FRONT OF YOU IS MARKED INTERNAL DRAFT ONLY THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE CALLS ARE STILL COMING IN THESE ARE CALLED THERE'S A HUNDRED NINETY SIX CALLS FROM OCTOBER THIRTIETH TO NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH. WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE THESE ARE OUR RESIDENTS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THAT WE SERVE IN THAT YOU SERVE AND YOU CAN SEE THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE HAVING THERE'S PROBABLY NOTHING DIFFERENT HERE THAN ANY OTHER REGION IN THIS STATE THAT HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY A POWER SHUT OFF. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ABOUT THE LETTER. WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY THOUGH REALLY IS WHEN I GO BACK AND I SAID IT WOULD IN A BOARD MEETING TOMORROW WITH MY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND THE PUBLIC COMES IN TO TALK ABOUT THIS POWER SHUT OFF THAT WE'RE PREPARING FOR ON WEDNESDAY I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT THIS HEARING I'VE BEEN HERE ALL DAY JUST AS YOU'VE BEEN HERE ALL DAY I CAN'T GO BACK AND TELL MY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT COME IN. THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING I CAN'T SAY THAT THERE'S ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON IN OCTOBER OCTOBER NINTH TWENTY THIRD TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE. WE HAD FOR POWER SHUT OFF WE HAD A HUNDRED AND TWENTY HOURS CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF NO POWER ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT CAME IN ALL DAY WHETHER IT WAS ACCESS TO FUNCTIONAL NEEDS OR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WE EXPERIENCED THAT AS WELL AND THE STATEMENT THAT. THERE WASN'T OR THERE WAS. A MINIMAL ECONOMIC IMPACT TO THE STATE MAYBE THAT'S TRUE BUT NOT IN RURAL COUNTIES AND CERTAINLY NOT IN MY COUNTY. OR IN OTHER SMALL RURAL COUNTIES. SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY TOMORROW BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT. P. JEANNIE ON WEDNESDAY IF THEY DECIDE TO SHUT THE POWER OFF FOR HUNDRED AND TWENTY HOURS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE MEDICAL NEEDS OR THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY'RE SUFFERING AS WELL. THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAS BEEN SAID OR DONE TODAY THAT COULD CHANGE THAT. SO I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO GO WITH THIS BUT WHEN I DO HAVE TO SAY. IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LETTER. AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN OTHER REGIONS. THAT HAVE HAD A POWER SHUT OFF BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS ONE. IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF A POWERSHUT OFF AGAIN. IN ANY REGION OF THE STATE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE IMPACTED AND WITH PGA ANY DID IN OCTOBER. WAS AND THEY CREATED A PUBLIC HEALTH EVENT FORTUNATELY NOBODY IN MY COUNTY DIED BUT IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN MY COUNTY OR ANY OTHER COUNTY. SO I'D LIKE TO SAY IF THERE'S ANY WAY. OF PRECLUDING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OURPOWER SHUT OFF OR ANYTHING THAT'S A EXTENDED THAT WILL IMPACT TO THE EDICALLY NEEDY OR THE MENTAL HEALTH CLIENTS. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT TO HAPPEN I DON'T SEE THAT TODAY I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT WE HAD P. JEANNIE COME OUT AND SPEAK TO OUR BOARD WE HAVE. COME OUT TWELVE. THEY SAID. BECAUSE JEANNIE AT THE UPPER ECHELON HAS NOT IMPACTED THEIR FRONTLINE STAFF. SAID THEIR LIAISONS WILL CALL THEY'RE REALLY GOOD ABOUT CALLING THEIR GOOD ABOUT. EMAILING BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION THEY'RE NOT EMPOWERED AND THEY'RE NOT EDUCATED I LEARNED MORE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND MAYBE YOU DID TOO. THAN I DID FROM P. JEANNIE AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE PUBLIC LEARNED MORE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA THAN THEY DID FROM GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE PUT PRESS RELEASES OUT WHEN WE HAD INFORMATION. SO AGAIN I KNOW WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT I HAVE ABOUT ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS I'D LIKE TO SAY AND- AN UNACCEPTABLE SCOPE AND DURATION IF WE CAN LOOK AT THAT THE COMMUNICATION INCONSISTENT INCOMPLETE YOU HAVE THE LETTER IN FRONT OF YOU. I THINK THE CPUC SHOULD DO MEETINGS OUT IN THE REGION'S I'D LIKE THEM TO COME TO THE SMALL WORLD COUNTIES AND SEE WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. AND HAVE THE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX PEOPLE COME IN AND TALK WITH THEM AS WELL. THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING AND I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS DONE AGAIN ON GOING COMMUNICATION. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND WEKNOW THAT PREVENTION IS IMPORTANT AND SO WE KNOW CALLOW YES. WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY'LL WORK WITH THE COUNTIES THE WORK WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND HELP US PREPARE. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE P. JEANNIE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT CAN'T JUST HAPPEN WHEN IT'S TWO DAYS BEFORE POWER SHUT OFF. IN POWER IN THE LIAISONS GETTING THE INFORMATION OUT THERE AND DOING SOMETHING THANK YOU MA'AM. AND I WANT TO THANK FOR THE LETTER IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE VERY THOROUGH VERY WELL DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO ITSELF THANK YOU. IN CONJUNCTION ITH THE PRESENTATION- SENATOR. PLEASE KIDS LATE IN THE DAY. SO GOOD TO YOU YOU HAVE ONE AND ASK A QUESTION AND THEN- SIR GALGIANI THANK YOU SO MUCH AT MISTER CHAIR IN A ONE AT. THANK YOU TO. OUR PREVIOUS SPENT ON THIS PANEL. SPECIAL THANK YOU TO- MISTER ANGELO IN. THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES IN CINEMA COUNTY OF COURSE MR GOLY. I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS RESEARCH HERE. PEOPLE ARE EXHAUSTED. THEY'RE FED UP. IN THE DESERVE BETTER. FEW OBSERVATIONS AND ONE QUICK QUESTION NUMBER ONE- ASISTIR BONE EMISSIONS FROM ABOUT CHAMBER SAID. I'M LOOKING IT FLKS GET THEIR ABILITY TO GET BACK UP AND RUNNING FROM THESE PARISHES IS TAKING LONGER THAN WHAT WE SAW FROM THE FIRE TWO YEARS AGO- IN THAT FIRE. I DESTROYED NEARLY SIX THOUSAND HOMES BETWEEN MENDOCINO LAKE NAPA AND SONOMA COUNTIES- IT WAS A GOOD TWO WEEKS. BECAUSE FOLKS STILL WITHOUT POWER WITHOUT GAS. I THEY WERE SO BACK YOU WAITED ON. AND THAT THE IMPACTS ARE REAL IN IT'S GOING TO BE SUSTAINED. I'D NEVER SEEN FOOD BANK LINES LIKE WHAT I SAW TWO WEEKS AGO. IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SEE ON TELEVISION INTERVAL COUNTRIES. AND IT'S AN ACCEPTED ONE FRIGGIN ACCEPTABLE. AND THOSE WHO ARE. HOURLY WAGE EMPLOYEES HAS SUFFERED THE MOST THEY CAN RESTOCK THE REFRIGERATORS AS SOME MAY HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE LUCKY THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO. THEY CAN'T PAY THE RENT. FOR SYNDICATE SCHOOL LUNCH. SO WE I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO KICK IN SUPPORT FOR FOOD BANKS FOR LOOKING AT- CONTINUED POWER SHUT US INTO THE NEXT YEAR AND I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE COUNTY MINISTER FOR THE CHIEF- AS WELL AS EMERGENCY MANAGER. YOU OF ALL BECOME P. GENIES EMERGENCY RESPONSE MANAGEMENT AGENCY. YOU DON'T WANT IT BUT YOU HAD TO DO IT. THE QUESTION I ASKED TO SEE OVER THERE TODAY'S COMPENSATION FOR LOCAL AGENCIES UNDERSTANDING HOW CHALLENGING IT IS IN THIS WOULD NOT OBVIOUSLY. HELP WITH THE EXHAUSTION OF THE FATIGUE BY LIKE TO BE TO GET YOUR TAKE ON COMPENSATION FOR THANK YOU WOULD SEE LIKE AN F. MAG GRANT DURING A FIRE POTENTIALLY 75% OF COSTS- THAT COME THROUGH DURING FIRES EARTHQUAKES ECCENTRIC. AND IF IT'S OKAY FOR THE CHAIR. THE THREE INDIVIDUALS THE CHIEF THE MUSEUM IF THEY CAN ANSWER BRIEFLY IF THERE'S A PARTICULAR RESPONSE A BRIEF ANSWER PLEASE. THE CONCEPT IS GOOD I WOULD SUPPORT SOME SORT OF MECHANISM FOR REIMBURSEMENT- THERE IS A REAL COST AN ACTUAL COST- EVERY TIME WE OPEN THE EOC THE D. O. C. WE MOBILIZE RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY- TO EMS RESOURCES THAT ARE IN RESPONSE TO PS PS. THE TICKET NEEDED. AND I WOULD JUST OFFER THAT IT SHOULD BE A DOLLAR PER PERSON PER HOUR OF POWER OUTAGE. THANK YOU. LIKE TO SAY THAT WE STARTED PREPARING MONTHS BEFORE THIS SO THAT WE WOULD BE READY BUT IT DEFINITELY WITH THE- RESOURCE CENTERS THAT P. JEANNIE OPEN FROM EIGHT EIGHT THEYDID NEED SECURITY AND WE DID SEND PUBLIC SAFETY OUT THERE AND OF COURSE THERE WAS NO REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT. THANK YOU. THERE ARE A GALGIANI. AND WHAT I AM WHAT I WAS HEARING FROM THE C. E. O. FOR THE COUNTY OF MENDOCINO COUNTY REMINDS ME OF WHAT I HEARD MY DISTRICT WE WENT WENT FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS AND- PEOPLE WERE DEFAULTING ON THEIR LOANS AT RATES. THAT WERE JUST UNBELIEVABLE AND UNHEARD OF IN MODERN HISTORY AND WE FELT IN MY DISTRICT FIRST BUT- THE FRONTLINE STAFF AT THE BANKS DIDN'T HAVE BE. THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO KNOW WHAT TO DO HOW TO DIRECT PEOPLE. AND THE PROBLEM IS HAPPENING SO QUICKLY THAT THEY THEY COULDN'T ABSORB ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DIRECT PEOPLE AND IT WASN'T UNTIL. WE WERE DEEP AND- VERY DEEP AND TO THE MORTGAGE CRISIS THAT. THE BANKS STARTED HAVING- LOAN MODIFICATION OFFICERS WHO ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THINGS. I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THE IOUS ARE SO DEEP AND THE AND THE- CHALLENGE OF EVERYTHING THAT'S IN FRONT OF THEM RIGHT NOW BUT- YOU'LL BE MAKING A GRAVE MISTAKE IF YOU DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR FRONT LINE STAFF AND GIVE THEM. SOME TRAINING OR HAVE SOME. AND SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU. AND MAY POINT PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE TRAINED IN WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO POINT. CUSTOMERS TO THE RESOURCES IN THE WAY THEY THEY SHOULD ORAT LEAST HAVE TROUBLE SHOOTERS OR SOMETHING IN PLACE SO THAT YOU CAN GET A LITTLE BIT IN FRONT OF THIS. BY HAVING FRONTLINE STAFF BE MORE TRAINED ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE INCOMING PROBLEMS. THANK YOU WILL LAST FOR NICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND WERE VERY SORRY THAT IT'S TAKEN THIS ENTIRE DAY. BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR SERVICE TO OUR STATE. WE'RE ALSO GONNA ASK BECAUSE OTHER. A REPRESENTATIVE SERVE FROM UTILITY AND WATER DISTRICTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO DAVID PETERSON- DON BOLAND AND MEL GRANDY. BEGINNING WITH A DAVID PETERSON DIRECTOR LAST WEEK IN THIS WATER DISTRICT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE BOARD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DAVID PETERSON I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER OF LOS REGION IT'S MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT WERE EIGHTY OP RETAIL WATER AND WASTEWATER AGENCY THAT SERVES THE WESTERN PORTION OF LA COUNTY. AND WHAT I WANTED TO DO IS SHARE WITH YOU- THE PERSPECTIVE A WATER AND WASTE WATER AGENCIES ON PS PS EVENTS I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ITEM FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER- AND I'LL BE SHARING MY OWN EXPERIENCES FROM MY AGENCY BUT ALSO FROM- FEEDBACK I RECEIVE STATEWIDE. THROUGH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. SPECIFICALLY HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THREE DIFFERENT AREAS ONE WITH REGARD TO COMMUNICATIONS. TO OPERATIONAL IMPACTS AND THEN THREE FINANCIAL IMPACTS AND I DID SUBMIT ALSO WRITTEN TESTIMONY THAT I WOULD ASK BE ACCEPTED FOR THE RECORD. OUR IS IT WORTH DID YOU SUBMITTED. OKAY WE HAVE A OPTIONS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT- AND THAT OUR WATER AND WASTEWATER AGENCIES WE NEED ELECTRICITY TO DO OUR JOB WE CANNOT PUMP AND TREAT THE WATER THAT PEOPLE NEED AS AS A AN ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS VERY BASIC HUMAN NEEDS HERE DRINKING COOKING CLEANING BATHING. SANITATION AND IMPORTANTLY FIRE PROTECTION AS WELL OUR WATER SYSTEMS PROVIDE A FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM. AND SO OUR GOAL WHEN WE LOOK AT PS PS EVENTS AS WATER UTILITIES IS THAT WE CANNOT HAVE AN INTERRUPTION IN SERVICE WE NEED TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS SERVICE REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITIONS. AND SO WE HAVE A GREAT CHALLENGE IN DOING THAT- IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION ARE HIGH ENERGY PROVIDER IS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. WE RECEIVE SIXTY SIX NOTIFICATIONS OF PS PS EVENTS TEN OF THEM RESULTED IN SHUT OFFS AND I WILL SAY THAT WITH EDISON WE HAVE HAD A POSITIVE. EXPERIENCE IN THAT THE DATA WAS BOTH TIMELY AND ACCURATE BUT IT TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AS YOU'VE HEARD. TODAY THOUGHT GENERALLY SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD IS THE LACK OF ADEQUATE ADVANCE NOTICE OF THE SHOT OFFICE. THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA AND THE GRANULARITY OF THAT DATA AND THEN LAST INFORMATION LACKING ON THE TIME LINE FOR RESTORATION OF SERVICE- SO IN TERMS OF THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION COMMUNICATIONS IS THAT THERE'S NEED AND VALUE. IN HAVING ENHANCED AND STANDARDIZE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS FOR PS PS EVENTS. WITH REGARD TO OPERATIONS FOR OUR UTILITIES THERE'S MAJOR OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WHEN THE POWER GOES OFF WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY OPERATE OUR WATER SYSTEMS DIFFERENTLY. OUR WATER SYSTEMS ARE VERY AUTOMATED WE HAVE TO BRING IN EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT NORMALLY AT WORK WE HAVE TO PUT PUMPS IN MANUAL MODE WHEN WE GET A NOTIFICATION. WE ACTUALLY CALLING ALL OF OUR PUMPS TO GOING FILL OUR WATER TANKS AND THEN WE HOLD OUR TANKS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE WE DON'T ALLOW THEM TO CYCLE THROUGH THE NORMAL RANGE LIKE THEY DO- AND THEY'RE DESIGNED TO OPERATE. ON ALL OF THAT. REQUIRES USING POWER AT TIMES WHEN WE WOULD WOULD NOT NORMALLY. FREQUENTLY% DURING PEAK PERIODS AND ONE POWERS MOST EXPENSIVE. AND THEN WHAT POWER ACTUALLY GOES OFF THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF ACTIONS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE WE NEED TO DEPLOY EMERGENCY GENERATORS. AND THEN WE NEED TO CONTINUOUSLY GO OUT AND- CHECK ON THOSE EMERGENCY GENERATORS REFUEL THEM AND WE NEED TO HAVE MECHANICS ELECTRICIANS ON HAND ALL TIME AT ALL TIMES. TO SERVICE THOSE GENERATORS. TOM WE HAVE AGENCIES AS WELL WHO HAVE HAD TO RENT GENERATORS AND RENTING GENERATORS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT. IN SOME CASES GENERATORS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR RENT. ALL OF THESE GENERATORS FOR THE TYPE AND THE SIZE OF. OUR FACILITIES THAT WE NEED MOVING- WATER REQUIRES A LOT OF POWER. THESE ARE LARGE- PIECES OF EQUIPMENT AND RUN ON DIESEL POWER. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE RUN INTO IS THAT- THERE ARE STRICT AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THESE DIESEL ENGINES. AND THAT HAS BEEN A BARRIER FOR US IN RUNNING OUR ENGINES UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES SOURCE SECOND RECOMMENDATION. IS THAT SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL WITH REGARD TO THE NUMERIC RUN TIMES. THAT ARE CONTAINED IN BOTH STATE AND LOCAL AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS. FOR GENERATORS AND THEN LAST IN THE AREA FINANCIAL IMPACT. THERE'S A BIG FINANCIAL IMPACT IN TERMS OF ADDED LABOR OVERTIME EQUIPMENT RENTALS I MENTION PEAK PERIOD POWER. AND THEN FUEL- AND THEN ON THE CAPITAL SIDE THERE'S A BIG IMPACT IN TERMS OF. PURCHASING ADDITIONAL PORTABLE GENERATORS AND ALSO FIXED ON A STATIONARY EMERGENCY GENERATORS. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE THE EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT THAT SERVES A LARGE PORTION OF WESTERN. I RIVERSIDE COUNTY THEY ESTIMATED FOR THEIR AGENCY ALONE. THAT WOULD COST SIXTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR THEM TO GET GENERATORS THAT THEY NEED. ONLY FOR THEIR COMMUNITY SO IF YOU WERE TO EXTRAPOLATE THAT STATEWIDE TO QUICKLY SEE THAT THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEED. BOB THE GOVERNOR'S PROGRAM IN THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS VERY HELPFUL THE PROBLEM IS THAT MONEY IS ON AVAILABLE TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS LIKE MINE. THAT MONEY IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO STATE COUNTY AND LOCAL INCORPORATED CITY GOVERNMENT SO THERE'S A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR INDEPENDENT SPECIAL DISTRICTS LIKE MINE IN EASTERN IN THE HUNDREDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT PROVIDE WATER SERVICE THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. NOT DONE BOLAND. PHONE CALL ONE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEE WE AA ARE I'M HERE REPRESENTING OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FOLKS WE REPRESENT IN THE STATE OPERATION CENTERS THE PARTNER THE OLE YES REPRESENTING POWER ON THE THREE I- USE FROM THIS MORNING- WE REPRESENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS CABLE WATER WASTEWATER GAS IN PIPELINES IN A AS SUCH WE STAMP THE UTILITY OPERATIONS CENTER WE CAN'T TWO OF THE P. JEANNIE ENGINEERS AND WE HAD A SEASON THERE SO WE HAD TIMELY INFORMATION FROM THE GREED AS THIS EVENT UNFOLDED. IT CANNOT BE OVERSTATED THE LAST MONTH'S POWER SHUT ALL PLACED A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON ALL OF OUR TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS ALL OF OUR TELL COMMON CABLE NETWORKS RUN ON COMMERCIAL POWER NO ONE FOR SAW THE SERIES OF POWER SHUT OFF OR THE SIZE OR MAGNITUDE OR THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE COMMERCIAL POWER IS. REALLY CRITICAL TO PROVIDING ANY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES NETWORKS ARE DESIGNED WITH BACKUP POWER MULTIPLE POINTS OF THE NETWORK TO WITHSTAND ISOLATED AND TEMPORARY POWER ISSUES BUT NETWORKS ARE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF A CONTINUOUS SOURCE OF POWER RESPONDING TO THESE ON PRESIDENT PROLONGED WIDESPREAD OUTAGES WAS A TRULY HURT PLANETES WIRELESS AND WIRELINE CARRIERS WERE FACED WITH MAINTAINING A VAST MAJORITY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE THIS PROGRESSED IN THE NORTH AND ENDED IN SAN DIEGO ON THE SOUTH. WE ARE VERY ADEPT AT RESPONDING TO GEOGRAPHIC TO FIRE STILL LANDSLIDES TO FLOODS BUT WHEN YOU TRY TO MOBILE DOES KIND RESOURCES ACROSS AN EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILE PER AT THAT THE. STATE IT BECOMES TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT. WHEN THE I. O. U. SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOT PORTIONS OFF WE THEN HAD TO REACH OUT TO A SCALE ON HEARD OF. BY AUGMENTING ALL OF OUR EXISTING EQUIPMENT WITH HUNDREDS OF IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE RESOURCES. CARRIERS COMMUNICATE WITH THE I. O. U.'S DIRECTLY TO PREPARE FOR RESPONDED THE SHUT OFFS BACKUP POWER SOLUTIONS WERE INCLUDED COMBINATIONS OF PICS GENERATORS BACKUP BATTERIES IS STRATEGICALLY PLACED PORTABLE GENERATORS. THROUGHOUT THIS FOLLOWED ALL ESTABLISHED IN LEGAL PROTOCOLS ADDITIONALLY WIRELESS CARRIERS PROVIDED DETAILS STATUS THREE TIMES A DAY THE CALIFORNIA- E. S. THROUGH SEE WE A WE PROVIDED THOSE ON THE GENERATORS ONLINE OFFLINE IN OFFTHE GRID. AT SEVEN AM ONE THIRTY AND SEVEN PM EVERY DAY IN THE SOCK TO THE SOCCER AUTHORITIES AT NO POINT. DID WE HAVE TO ASK OR DID WE HAVE TO SEND OPINION QUERY SICK ANY COMMERCIAL CARRIER FOR INFORMATION THEY READILY PROVIDED. THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT. NETWORK FAILURES CAUSING WIDESPREAD IN TANKS. IN THESE REPORTS THAT WERE FIRE RELATED. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IMMEDIATELY UPON THE LOSS OF THE NETWORK AT NO POINT WERE ANY THESE CANCER DELAYS AND PROVIDING DE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PICTURE DELAYED OR NOT PROVIDED ON THE WIRELESS SIDE NETWORK CENTRAL OFFICES HAD IN ZIP FIX GENERATION DESIGNED FOR MULTIPLE DAYS AS WELL AS BACK UPS TO PROVIDE POWER WHEN GENERATORS ARE OFFLINE. IN THE EVENT OF A COMMERCIAL IT IS LOS THE ACCESS TIME FRAME GENERATORS NEED IN THIS REFUELING BECOMES A CHALLENGE IN SAFE CONDITIONS PER THE MORE REMOTE TERMINAL SUBS NOTES WHICH CONNECTED TO THE CENTRAL OFFICE OR HIGGINS HAVE BATTERY BACKUP SYSTEMS THAT ROUTE ROUTINELY RECHARGE WHEN PLACED BACK ON BY GENERATIONS THESE ALSO EXCEEDED THE TIME LIMIT. MAINTAINING POWER TO BOTH WIRELINE AND WIRELESS DISABILITIES IT IS A MOVING TARGET AND AS THE P. S. P. S. PROGRESS AND THEN WAS REESTABLISHED DURING THE FIRST TWO SHUTTLES IN SOME CASES IN HUMBLE COLOR CARRIERS HAD LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS NOTICE TO PRE STAGED GENERATORS DUE TO THE CHANGING CONDITIONS BY THE PS PS. STAGING GENERATORS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT BUT IT IS ALSO TIME AND FUEL SENSITIVE SO TO ADDRESS LIMITATIONS OF BATTERY WIRELESS MISSILE OF THESE OFTEN IF NOT ALWAYSHAVE BATTERY SOLUTIONS ON COMMERCIAL I WOULD CHOOSE THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR ONE TWO OR EVEN THREE DAYS BEYOND THAT THEY'RE NOT IN THE DESIGN THANK OR ROBUST BACKUP POWER SOLUTIONS THEN ARE DESIGNED FOR A VARIETY. OF PHYSICAL AND TECHNICAL NOT TO MENTION PERMITTING. WELL FIX GENERATORS ARE OFTEN PERMANENTLY INSTALLED SITES WERE STRUCTURES FEASIBLE AND PERMITTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PORTABLE GENERATION ALLOW MORE FLEXIBILITY. IN THE ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GENERAL TO MAN AND CAN BE RAPIDLY DEPLOYED. THESE ALSO LOW HAM LIMITATIONS AS TO THE PLACEMENT AND LOCATIONS INCLUDING WHERE WE CAN'T ACCESS ROOFTOPS EQUIPMENT SITES. IN THE WAITED THE GENERATORS BEING TRANSPORTED IN LEGALLY MOVED YOU RIGHT OVER THE LESS ONE FIRES BREAK OUT AND SO NORMAN LOS ANGELES CARRIERS MAINTAIN THAT SERVICE CONTINUITY AND DEPLOYED CAL'S. COLDS AND ALL OTHER ASSETS. WHAT WE DO NEED ASSISTANCE FROM RELIEF WITH OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN CARBS RESTRICTIONS WHEN WE'RE BRINGING THINGS IN FROM OUT OF REACH IN OR OUT OF STATE. WE CANNOT BE IMPEDED BY OUR OWN REGULATIONS BURKE AIR SAFETY OR ANYTHING ELSE AT NO TIME WAS ASSISTANCE NOT PROVIDED BY MULTIPLE CARRIERS MITIGATION EFFORTS GOING FORWARD THE IMPACT IN THE FUTURE MAYBE LESSEN WITH THE GREATEST DEGREE POSSIBLE. CARRIERS ARE NOW EXPLORING WAYS TO IMPROVE HOW TO RESTORE AND WHAT PROTOCOLS CAN BETTER MEET THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT CALIFORNIA'S GRID. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HELPED US IN THE U. OC IS THE AND BETTING OF S. C. E. N. P. GENIES TECHNICAL DIRECTORS OF THE GRID SO THAT WHEN A CIRCUIT CAME ONLINEWE COULD WE CROSSED OUR PEOPLE REMOVE THE GENERATOR AND RELOCATED TO WHERE IT'S NEEDED. THAT WAS IN REAL TIME ON REAL CIRCUITS AND WAS A REAL ADVANTAGE THANK YOU THANK YOU MEL GRANDY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BUT INMIGRANTE ON THE ELECTRIC UTILITY DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF YOU KILEY OF. WE ARE DIFFERENT IN TWO WEEKS TWO WAYS OF ANY OTHER SPEAKER YOU'VE LISTENED TO TODAY. ONE WAY IS THAT WE ARE A PUBLIC POWER UTILITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ABOUT FLOAT. IN YOUR CARDIO WE'RE FORTUNATE TO BE A PUBLIC POWER UTILITY. WE SERVE SIXTEEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS AN EIGHT DAY INFLUX OF ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE COME INTO THE DAY. THROUGHOUT ALL THESE OUTAGES A DEFECTIVE LAKES MOMA AND SINGLE COUNTY. THE CITY OF YOU BECAUSE IT WAS A RESOURCE CENTER THE WHOLE CITY. EITHER WE HAVE POWER O DURING SOME OF THE- S. P. S. EVENTS OR OUR OWN SYSTEM WENT DOWN UNDER THE TWENTY SIX TO VENT. BUT. BUSINESSES LIKE COSCO SAFE WAY WALMART HAD GENERATORS WE ASSISTED THEM WITH GENERATORS TO KEEP THEM UP. WE'RE A FULL SERVICE UTILITY SO WE DID ALL ONCE WE HEARD OF THE ISSUE COMING UP. THE PS PS WITHDREW ON FRIDAY IGHT LISTEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN ADVANCE WE IMMEDIATELY ASSEMBLED OUR COMMUNICATION CENTER. AND THAT'S ALSO WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER THE CONTACTED OR MEDICALLY. MEDICAL CUSTOMERS SO OUR MEDICAL CUSTOMERS ARE CONTACTED DIRECTLY ALREADY LARGE BUSINESSES WERE CONTACTED DIRECTLY TO WARN THEM AND TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF THIS. NOW I CAN GO THROUGH EVERYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THE SAME THING AS MANY OF THE OTHER CITIES DID BUT COMING OUT OF THIS. THREE THINGS ARE DEFINITELY DIFFERENT BUT I WAS MENTIONING WEIRD TWO WAYS DIFFERENT ONE WHERE PUBLIC. OUR UTILITY THE SECOND IS WE'RE TRANSMISSION CUSTOMER P. JEANNIE. WE'RE NOT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WERE ONE TO P. JEANNIE. AND BEING ON THE TRANSMISSION LEVEL IT'S MUCH MORE TECHNICAL IT'S MUCH MORE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO GET FROM P. GINNY WE WERE TREATED IF YOU WILL AS A- HOUSEHOLD CUSTOMER. BEING THAT ONE CUSTOMER. IN THE THREE THINGS THAT WE NEED AND REQUEST IN ONE WORK WITH PT BEYOND IS A COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL THOSE PRODUCT TO YOU BEFORE. THAT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT HE THROUGHOUT THE EVENT YOU WOULD HAVE THE WEBSITE THE CONFERENCE CALL IN- POINT OF CONTACT HAVING THREE DIFFERENT PIECES THE INFORMATION. VERY RARELY THEY WERE CONSISTENT THOSE TIME LIKE SEVEN. THAT'S ONE SECOND ONE IS ADVANCE PLANNING. ON THE TRANSMISSION SIDE IT'S NOT MAGIC. IT'S THE STUDIES AND YOU CAN BRING UP ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN SCENARIOS OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN THAT AS WE DID ON THE TWENTY SIX THAT WOULD COVER THOSE SINNERS SO WE COULDN'T THREE PLAN. AND THIS CAN BE DONE MONTHS AHEAD THAT WE CAN PRI PLAN HOW WE'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO THOSE ISSUES SO IF WE HAVE A PLAY BOOK IF YOU WILL OF. PRE PLANNING THE EVENTS ON THE TRANSMISSION LEVEL NOT THE DISTRIBUTION. AND THEN THIRDLY IS ALSO WITH MUTUAL AID MUTUAL AID WE FOUND THAT WE WERE CALLED UPON. THE ELEVENTH HOUR IT WASN'T A- FEW DAYS AHEAD OR AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE PS PS WE'RE CALLED UPON AT THE VERY. THE ELEVENTH HOUR OF THE EVENT WHERE IF WE HAD SOME PLANNING ON THAT ALSO WE COULD BE MUCH MORE ADVANTAGE ADVANTAGE IN RECEPTACLE TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU OUTLINING YOUR REQUESTS. HEATHER BRINGS US TO THE END OF OUR OF OUR PRESIDENT FOR CALENDAR YEAR OUR AGENDA NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO IF THERE'S MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT. ON ON THIS PROCEEDING AND THE ON THE EVENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO THIS. THIS HEARING A PLEASE LINE UP AND TRY TO LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS BUT A MINUTE IF YOU CAN. PROCEED MA'AM. THANK YOU SENATOR BYRD AT DEL KERO EXECUTIVE THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS VERY BRIEF CENTER I CAN STARTED OFF TODAY TALKING ABOUT THAT'S HUMAN NATURE IN THE STATE OF CRISIS TO WANT TO HELP EACH OTHER NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR. IT'S IN THAT SPIRIT THAT WE ARE HERE TODAY TO JUST MAKE FIVE FOUR THREE MAIN POINTS ABOUT THE VALUE OF DISTRIBUTED SOLAR STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES TO SOLVING THE CURRENT CRISIS THAT CALIFORNIA FINDS ITSELF IN ONE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RELY JUST ON DIESEL GENERATORS FOR EMERGENCY BACKUP SOLAR AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEPLOYABLE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING FLAT BED TRUCKS WITH RECHARGE BATTERIES. MOBILE PEAVEY UNITS THAT CAN ACTUALLY KEEP A CUSTOMER AS BIG AS A PUBLIC SCHOOL OPEN DURING THE UPCOMING BLACKOUT WE'RE HERE TO HELP AND DEPLOY THOSE RESOURCES LIKE WE DO IN OTHER REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. SECOND IS TO SENATOR TWICE SO TO YOUR COMMENT EARLIER WE COULD ACTUALLY FOCUS AND DEPLOY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS FOR CRITICAL NEEDS PURPOSES OVER THE COMING YEAR IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT WAVE OF BLACKOUTS NEXT YEAR JUST TO GIVE YOU ONE SENSE pTWO THOUSAND SCHOOL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA WITH. SOLAR SYSTEMS AREREADY WE COULD FOCUS IN A AND A QUICK THOSE SCHOOLSWITH A BATTERY BACKUP SYSTEM ESPECIALLY FOCUSING ON THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE SUBJECT LIKELY TO PASS PASS EVENT NEXT YEAR. GET THOSE FOLKS WITH BOLTED AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE ALL CAN ALSO CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT YEAR ROUND. THE THIRD WAY AND THIS GETS AT P. GENIES POINTS ABOUT SECTION LIES ATION AS WE LOOK FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS WE AGREE WITH THE IDEA OF SEXUAL LIES IN THE GREAT IN KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY. P. GINNY MENTIONED MIKE REGRETS I WANT TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THAT THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS TO ROOFTOP SOLAR AND STORAGE SYSTEMS BEHIND THE METER IN ADDITION ONE IS EVERY CUSTOMER THAT HAS THEIR OWN SOLAR AND STORAGE SYSTEM. WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY SECTION. IS PROVIDING A IS DRAWING LESS ON THE GRID DURING THAT OUTAGE EVENT THEY ARE LESS OF A BURDEN ON THE GRID AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING A RESOURCE IN THAT WAY. SECOND IS THROUGH VIRTUAL POWER PLANTS WE CAN AGGREGATE ALL OF THOSE SMALL BEHIND THE METER SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROVIDING VALUE YEAR ROUND AND CLEAN ENERGY AROUND YOU SAID YOU'D BE BRIEF. CENTER WE ARE WE'RE HERE TO HELP WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL HOLD A WHOLE PANEL AND A WHOLE DAY JUST ON SOLUTIONS WE HAVE MORE SOLUTIONS THAT WERE DEPLOYING. WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A STATE WIDE PLAN TO BRING DISTRIBUTED SOLAR AND STORAGE TO SCALE AND AT SPEED. LET'S MAKE THAT HAPPEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND WORK BECAUSE SPEAK INTO THE MIKE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN SO SORRY ABOUT. AND CAN YOU ASSEMBLY HAVE THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT MISTER PETERSON MADE. RELATED TO WATER AGENCIES IN THE IMPACT OF PS PS EVENTS. AQUA REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. MANY OF THEM ARE EXPERIENCING THE IMPACTS OF A P. S. P. S. EVENTS. WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE WATER DURING THOSE EVENTS WE FEEL IT'S CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE DO THAT. A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES ARE PRESENTED. WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT AND SO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AQUA'S IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THIS- LEGISLATIVE BY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE-TO. FULFILL ALL OUR OUR MANDATE OF PROVIDING WATER WASTEWATER SERVICES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CATTY BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE SIXTY ONE. PHYSICIAN HEALTH OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTY JURISDICTIONS. THE SERGEANT IS DISTRIBUTING A LETTER FROM US YOU HEARD A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION TODAY. ABOUT HOW THESE POWER SHUT US DON'T NECESSARILY INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY- SO IN THAT SENSE WE THINK THEY MIGHT BE BEST NAMES- AND WE JUST IN THAT LETTER POINTED OUT THAT IN SOME DISASTERS SUCH AS HURRICANE IRMA IT WAS THE LOSS OF POWER. THAT ACTUALLY COST MORE LIVES THAN THE DISASTER ITSELF- SO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE TODAY WE HOPE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. GOOD EVENING SIR. SENATORS ON GROUNDS TO SEARCH WITH THE GREEN YOUTH ALLIANCE. THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS MARATHON SESSION ON THE- YES AND- HOPE. PLEASE CONSIDER FIXING THE WIRES AND INSTALLING. PREVENTION RELAYS TO CUT THE POWER IN THE LINES GO DOWN SIX IN ORDER BOTH REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE PS PS AND ITS DURATION. AND YOU HEARD FROM MISTER JOHNSON OF PHOTO P. JEANNIE THAT THEY CAN BURY THE DISTRIBUTION LINES ANOTHER TRANSMISSION LINES SO MAYBE THAT TRANSMISSION IS BURNED IT'S LOS BRIDGE AND- WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING MICRO GRIDS. ON A MUCH BIGGER LEVEL ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE PLEASE CONSIDER THE. ANALOGOUS PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND HOW WE CAN USE THOSE TO RUN CRITICAL LOADS IN OUR HOUSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI ANA ACT IN WITH FREED CENTER FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING COVERING FIVE WORLD COUNTIES INCLUDE INCLUDING ABOUT IT AND YUBA COUNTIES. WE SCREEN A HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN CALLS DURING THIS LAST POWER OUTAGE HOPE THE EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS WITH BACKUP BATTERIES HOTELS OR TRANSPORTATION THROUGH SUPPORT OF P. JEANNIE FUNDING- WE HEARD STORIES THAT YOU COULD NOT BELIEVE FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WHO SET UP SIX HOURS LEFT OF OXYGEN. I'M GONNA LAY DOWN IN BED SO THAT I DON'T USE IT YOU KNOW ANY MORE OXYGEN THAN I NEED TO. I DRIVE AROUND EVERY FOUR HOURS TO TRY TO FIND POWER TO POWER MY OXYGEN MACHINE. SO I'M I HAVE. A COUPLE THINGS I JUST WANT TO MENTION ONE IS THAT THROUGH OUR SERVICES WE REDUCE HOSPITAL READMISSIONS WE AT FOURTEEN PEOPLE GO INTO THE HOSPITAL JUST FOR POWER IN OUR WORLD COMMUNITY AT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER. DURING THE NEXT SET OF POWER OUTAGES WE ACTUALLY HAD ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS GO BACK TO DOOR INTERVENTIONS. SO IF YOU- SOLUTIONS I'D LIKE TO THROW OUT THERE ONE IS STATE OPERATIONS NEED TO INCLUDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. RESOURCES IN STATE STATE MEDICAID CONTRACTS WE NEED MANAGE CARE PROVIDERS HMO THAN ANYONE HEALTH PROVIDER THAT PROVIDES DME. ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY ALSO PAPER BACK UP BATTERIES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT PROVIDING THOSE THAT THE A ME TOO- WE NEED LOCAL SUPPORT TO ASSIST THE ONE ON ONE TRAINING- AND SUPPORT THAT ASSN THE LOCAL GRASSROOTS LEVEL ARE DOING- SO WE NEED SUPPORT THAT LOCAL COLLABORATION AND WE NEED. A ROBUST COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND I'LL JUST SAY THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS PLAY ON THE STATE THAT THIS IS A VERY RELEVANT CONVERSATION ONE IS THE GOVERNOR'S MASTER PLAN ON AGING. RIGHT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE COORDINATE. AROUND ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS- WE ALSO HAVE AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTIONSTHAT FREED AS A PART OF IT. AND WE SEE THAT PLAYING OUT ON. A REAL LEVEL LOCALLY THAT HELPS US COORDINATE SERVICE. AS AND GET PEOPLE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO LIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AMY DURBIN OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND SEE MAY LOOKS FORWARD TO BEING PART OF ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN PRESERVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE AND NECESSARY MEDICATIONS AND TREATMENT. DURING PS PS THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS RUSSELL RAWLINGS I AM THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY FOR RESOURCES FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING. THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER SERVING SACRAMENTO AND YOLO COUNTIES. ALTHOUGH OUR IMPACT HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED GIVEN THAT YOLO COUNTY IN OUR CATCHMENT AREA WAS THE ONLY COUNTY TO BE AFFECTED BY PS PS WE HAVE SEEN- THE- EFFORTS AND HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT- WERE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND I PERSONALLY HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE IS A LACK OF. DISCUSSION AROUND TRANSPORTATION RESILIENCY IN THIS PLAN AND I'M CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OTHERS WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS BUT THEY RELY UPON DURING THESE TIMES OF CRISIS. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE MARGINALIZED GROUP. THEY ARE- PEOPLE OF ALL TYPES- LGBTQ PLUS- ALL RACES AND ETHNICITIES AND INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE HARD OF HEARING AND BLIN AND ALL PLANS MUST INCLUDE. THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THESE COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. HI GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS DANNY ANDERSONAND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDEPENDENT LIVING RESOURCE CENTER SERVING VENTURA SANTA BARBARA AND SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTIES. AND IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT UP TO KEEP IT BRIEF I JUST WANT TO MENTION HOW IMPORTANT IS FOR THE- THE CENTERS THAT MAYBE OPEN UP FOR CHARGING TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO CHARGE LARGER MEDICAL DEVICES MORE THAN JUST CELL PHONES AND ALSO HAVE PEOPLE. WHO ARE THERE WHETHER FROM PARTNER AGENCIES OR SOME OTHER ORGANIZATION WHO ARE TRAINED ON HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH AND HOW TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. I'M THE ONLY INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER IN THE STATE HO HAS BOTH PGA ANY AND AS C. E. AS PART OF HER SERVICE AREA AND WE ARE WORKING WITH BOTH COMPANIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND I'M SEEING SOME REALLY POSITIVE THINGS FROM THAT THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GO BACK TO IS THAT THE MEDICAL BASS LINE PROGRAM WELL IT IS A WONDERFUL PROGRAM IT'S CERTAINLY AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL DAYS NOT CAPTURING EVERYBODY WHO HAS NEEDS. SO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING IN MIND THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT ON THE MEDICAL BE SIGNED PROGRAM THAT PERHAPS AREN'T GOING TO BE GETTING. BATTERIES FROM PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE SPECIFIC TO THAT PROGRAM BUT ARE STILL VERY VERY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE BARELY MAKING RENT AT THEIR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHO CAN'T GO OUT AND BUY A GENERATOR BY A BACKUP BATTERY SYSTEMS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OTHER FUNDING SOURCES TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE. WHO NEED IT JUST AS MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THE THIRTY SEVEN WORLD CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. WE'VE BEEN GROUND ZERO IS AT THE CENTER FOR A LOT OF THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS- SO FIRST OF ALL WANT TO THANK YOU ONE FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND THEN TO. FOR NUMEROUS COMMUNICATIONS WITH YOUR STAFF. ABOUT THESE EVENTS AND HOW WE CAN MITIGATE THE IMPACT THE WAS EVENTS GOING FORWARD. SO OUR PERSPECTIVE IS WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR IT NARROWLY TAILORED P. S. P. S. EVENTS. EVENTS THAT MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND- SINCE THE POPULATIONS. BUT WE'RE STILL DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE ROLLOUT OF THESE EVENTS TO DATE. ESPECIALLY THE IMPACTS ON COUNTY OPERATIONS LIKE WE'VE HEARD WITH RESPECT TO- PERSONAL DEPLOYMENT AND BACKUP GENERATION- THE PROVISION OF CRITICAL EMERGENCY SERVICES. BECAUSE OUT JUST TO THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK- IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY WHEN A GENERATOR CATCHES A HOUSE ON FIRE OR SOMEONE RUNS OUT OF OXYGEN- AND THEN. OF COURSE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOMETHING OF AN AT RISK- CALIFORNIANS SO THE UTILITIES MUST REDUCE AND MITIGATE THE IMPACTS TO THOSE ENTITIES. AND A COUPLE INTERESTING- ASPECTS OF THAT I DIDN'T HEAR COME UP. WITH RESPECT TO TELECOM AND THE OUTAGES IN THE TELECOM SECTOR. WE HEARD AN ANECDOTE OF IMPACTS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. WHERE THE FIRE STATION COULDN'T CONTACT THE CREWS OUT IN THE FIELD- WHERE SOME FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD TO RELY ON HAM RADIO'S. TO PROVIDE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND THAT'S KIND OF. INTERESTING IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHEN WE HAVE SUCH- CONNECTIVITY ACROSS. A LARGE PART OF THE STATE NOT ALL THE STATE BUT A LARGE PART OF THE STATE. SO BE ON THAT WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS. THE NUMBER OF CENTERS THAT WILL PROVIDED SO FAR- AREN'T ADEQUATE IT'S ONE TO ABOUT EVERY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE DEPLOYED- WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORT BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY NEED TO BE OPEN. ALL. THIS IS FOR THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES- ESPECIALLY THOSE SENT TO THE POPULATIONS WITH MEDICALNEEDS. THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH UTILITIES ON BETTER COORDINATION FOR C. R. C.'S AND THANK YOU. CAN JONES WITH THREE FIFTY BAY AREA THREE FIFTY MARIN- JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS IS CLEARLY AN EMERGENCY AND I THINK YOU'RE TREATING IT LET THAT WAY. THE UTILITIES AS YOU HEARD BILL JOHNSON SAY TODAY HE WORKS FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS. ANY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME MORE THAN TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT WILDFIRES AND BANKRUPTCY. SO IDEAS LIKE MIKE REGRETS THERE'S A CQC MAKING JUST STARTING ON THAT THAT'S BASED ON SENATOR STERN'S BILL COUPLE YEARS AGO BUT THAT BILL BASICALLY GAVE THE UTILITIES PRETTY MUCH POWER OVER. MICHAEL GRIDS AND- THEY DON'T WANT THEM SO THAT'S NOT EXACTLY A GOOD. LINE OF ACTION FOR THAT KIND OF THING AND WE REALLY NEED THOSE RIGHT AWAY SO IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO MICROMANAGE BECAUSE- THE CPUC DOESN'T ONE OF MY COMMENTS. THE UTILITIES ARE NOT USED TO DOING THAT THE ONLY PLACE THAT CAN HAPPEN IS RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU. ALYSSA STILL HIGH WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION I WE APPRECIATE BEING INCLUDED IN TODAY'S DISCUSSION AS MISTER PETERSON NOTED SPECIAL DISTRICTS PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES IN VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT. PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY AND ARE CRITICAL TO MOVING FORWARD AND THROUGH THESE PAST RESIDENTS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES- DURING THEM AS HE ALSO NOTED WERE APPRECIATIVE FOR THE FUNDING ASSISTANCE THAT WAS GRANTED TO CITIES AND COUNTIES BUT UNFORTUNATELY SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THAT FUNDING. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE MOVING FORWARD TO INCREASE RESILIENCY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR ASK COULD BE THE ANY DISCUSSIONS FOR FUNDING ASSISTANCE MOVING FORWARD SPECIAL DISTRICT WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY ELIGIBLE. TO DROP THAT DOWN THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI AMAZON AVENGERS PHOTO WITH THE CLEAN COALITION SOME OF YOU KNOW US. AND I SENT A NUMBER OF YOU AN EMAIL YESTERDAY WITH SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION SO PLEASE FEEL FREE FREE TO REACH OUT WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU BUT IN A NUTSHELL. THIS ISN'T A HUGE PROBLEM THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTION BUT THERE ARE SOME ACTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE AND THAT WE SHOULD TAKE WE SHOULD REPLACE FRAGILE WIRES. WE SHOULD INSTALL POWER INTERRUPTERS TO STOP WIRES FROM SPARKING WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AVAILABLE. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR MICROGRAMS AND WE SHOULD PUT LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN CHARGE OF CREATING SOLAR PLUS STORAGE MY CURRENT. COMMUNITY MICRO GRIDS IN PARTICULAR BRING UNPARALLELED ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESILIENCE BENEFITS TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEY CAN KEEP CRITICAL COMMUNITY FACILITIES ONLINE AND DEFINITELY DURING ANY LENGTH OF POWER OUTAGE. NOW AGAIN WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THAT WHAT WE NEED IS A POLICIES AND MARKET MECHANISMS TO PROLIFERATE COMMUNITY MICROGRAPHS AND THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN HELP US WE NEED. FEET IN TERRACE TO MAKE THEM ECONOMICALLY VIABLE WE NEED TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION ACCESS CHARGES MARKET DISTORTION WHICH UNFAIRLY DISADVANTAGES CLEAN LOCAL ENERGY. IF WE FIX THAT WE GET A LOT MORE CLEAN LOCAL ENERGY AND DON'T HAVE TO RELY AS MUCH ON EXPENSIVE. VULNERABLE TRANSMISSION LINES AND WE NEED TO DIVEST S'UTILISE OF THEIR TRANSMISSION ASSETS WHICH WOULD REMOVE THEIR CURRENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH CLEAN LOCAL ENERGY. THANKS VERY MUCH. HI IF I WAS ONE THAT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR HANGING IN HERE TONIGHT AND FOR CREATING THIS. AVENUE FOR ALL OF US TO HEAR INFORMATION. YOU SHOWING IS THAT YOU CARE AND THANK YOU. MY NAME IS JENNIFER TANNER AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF INVISIBLE CALIFORNIA GREEN TEAM AND ALL THE THIRTY SIX INDIVISIBLE AND THREE FIFTY GROUPS THAT SIGNED THE LETTER TO LEGISLATORS TO AMEND AB TEN FIFTY FOUR. THIS LETTER IS INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSAL FOR REAL WILD FIRE MITIGATION THAT WAS JUST SENT TO ALL THE SENATORS. IN THIS COMMITTEE. ASKING THE FOLLOWING. WIRES ARE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS NOT THE TREES MAKE FIXING WIRES MANDATORY RIGHT NOW ONLY TEARING OUT TREES IS MANDATORY NUMBER TO PUT IN PROTECTIVE RELAYS TO STOP THE SPARKING BEFORE IT STARTS A FIRE WE KNOW THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY EXISTS EVERYONE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTING IT NOT TO SAN DIEGO GAS AND NUMBER THREE DEVELOP COMMUNITY MICHAEL GOODS FOR EMERGENCY ENERGY DURING BLACKOUTS MICHAEL ENERGY SOLAR ENERGY IT'S ALL HERE RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS. NOW THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT HI I'M LAUREN COLUMN WITH US YOUR CALL CALIFORNIA HERE REPRESENTING THIRTEEN LOCAL CHAPTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND HALF A MILLION MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN THE STATE. CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES A MASSIVE POWER SHUT OFFS ARE JUST THE LATEST IN A GROWING STREAM OF DISASTERS THAT REQUIRE ACCELERATED EFFORTS TO CUT CLIMATE POLLUTION. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW THINGS THAT WE DEEM ARE NECESSARY TO BETTER ADAPTED TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND MINIMIZE FUTURE POWER SHUT OFF AND THEN IMPACTS. FIRST WE GREW THE EMPHASIS PLACED ON GREAT HARDENING AND MONITORS AYE MODERNIZATION DURING THE DISCUSSION TODAY- WE NEED GREAT HER NAME PROGRAMS ALSO IMPLEMENT A SAFETY FIRST APPROACH. AND WE ALSO NEED TO REPLACE OLD EQUIPMENT WITH EQUIPMENT DESIGNED WITH ELECTRIFICATION OF LOCAL RENEWABLE ENERGY AND STORAGE IN MIND AND WE AGREE THAT THIS HARD NAY MUST BE DONE IN A TRANSPARENT MANNER SO THAT UTILITIES CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SECOND WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE EFFORTS TO HELP HOMES AND COMMUNITIES MOVE TOWARDS BECOMING MORE INDEPENDENT OF THE GRID INCLUDING BEHIND THE MAITRE CLEAN ENERGY AND STORAGE AS WELL AS MICROGRAMS. MY GRAVERT SERVING COMMUNITIES WITH THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SHOULD BECOME THE STANDARD CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRADE WILL BE CHALLENGED BY EVENTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR MORE MORE FREQUENTLY. AS CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO CAUSE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND WE BELIEVE IF PROPERLY CITED DESIGNED AND OPERATED THAT MICROBE GRADES HAVE A GREAT VALUE AND CAN BE AN INCREDIBLE ASSET TO THE STATE'S CLIMB ADAPTATION GOALS. LASTLY IN ADDITION TO CUT DATA TATIAN EFFORTS WE MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING AND THAT'S IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE CARBONIZED ECONOMY AND PHASE OUT GAS ENTIRELY WHILE ALSO WORKING TO BUILD THIS RESILIENT STATE. THAT CAN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION DESPITE DESTRUCTIVE EVENTS THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING JOHNSON YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA MRS MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION AND OUR ASSOCIATION IS COMPRISED OF UTILITIES IN BOTH THE PUBLIC WATER AND ELECTRIC SECTOR. WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR ALLOWING US TO HAVE COMMENTS TO DAY WE DO ONE ECHO THE SENTIMENTS THAT WERE RAISED BY MISTER PETERSON AS WELL AS OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. I AND SINCE OUR ASSOCIATION DOES REPRESENT PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES ON BOTH THE WATER AND ELECTRIC SECTOR WE JUST WANNA SERVICE RESOURCE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND STAFF MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. HI **** ROOMS- WILDFIRE SURVIVOR ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF WILDFIRES YOU'RE RIGHT FOR GROUPS IN CINEMA COUNTY. I'M ALSO PARTY TO THE CPUC. ARM WERE OUT THERE SUFFERING FIRST IT BY THE WILDFIRES WHAT OF FOLKS ARE HIT MULTIPLE TIMES BY THE POWER SEEK TO SHUT OFFS WONDERING WHERE SAFE PLACES TO GO- I WOULD JUST- ADVISE THAT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO. REGULATE OR LEGISLATE. A SAFETY CULTURE- I WOULD SAY METRICS METRICS METRIC METRICS YOU CAN'T MANAGE WHAT YOU CAN'T MEASURE. THERE ARE FINANCIAL MECHANISMS IT SHOULD BE PUT IN PLACE AND REGULATED. SO IT INCENTIVIZE IS THE UTILITIES TO INVEST IN THE RIGHT THINGS TOWARDS RENEWABLES. THAT INVEST IN THE RIGHT THINGS IN TERMS OF SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY THERE NEEDS TO BE PERFORMANCE METRICS UP IN DOWN. UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN'T JUST PICK TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY METRICS AND EXPECT THAT THOSE ARE GOING TO PERFORM. WE LEARN FROM THE CAN KATE FIRE THIS JUMPER WAS NO WHERE ON ANYONE'S RADAR. IN TERMS OF SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE CHECKED. THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE WE CAN'T RELY ON THOSE SIMPLE THINGS ONE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD JUST POINT OUT. ONE OF THE UNINTENDED SIDE EFFECTS OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR. IS THAT IT IS PUSHING SPEED OVER AFRICA SEE. AND EVERY PLACE IT HITS AND A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. PARTIES ARE MOTIVATED TO QUICKLY COME TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THAT DOES NOT LOOK AT THE FEASIBILITY OF HOW P. JEANNIE WILL BE ONCE IT EXITS BANKRUPTCY. WE NEED TO ESTABLISH THAT ARE WELCOME ANY AND ALL PARTIES TO COME TO THE TABLE. IN AND PUT FORWARD A GOOD SAFETY PLAN A SOLID WAY TO MOVE FORWARD BUT IT NEEDS TO BE BASED ON METRICS. SIMILARLY IN THE CPUC WE ARE LOOKING AT. SHORT CUTS TO- TO THE PROCEEDINGS SO THAT WE CAN MOVE ALONG AT A FAST PACE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO. TO MAKE SUE THAT THAT AFRICAN. SEASON COMPROMISED I WOULD APPRECIATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMISSION MOKE SIMON LAKE COUNTY DISTRICT ONE SUPERVISOR. BUT ALSO THE TROUBLE CHAIRMAN OF THE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA- ALL SPEAK FIRST FOR THE COUNTY SIDE. LAKE COUNTY HAS BEEN AFFECTED. MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY. NOW WE'RE NOT SAYING MORE DEVASTATING THE PARADISE FIRE WAS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING WE'VE AT 65% OF OUR LAND BASE THAT IS BURNED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. SO FOR LAKE COUNTY TWENTY FIFTEEN IS WHEN THE CATASTROPHIC FIRE STARTED I WAS NOT CAUSED BY P. G. BUT THAT'S WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST INITIAL CATASTROPHIC FIRE. YEAR AFTER YEAR WE'VE BEEN INUNDATED BY FIRES ONCE AGAIN THIS YEAR EVEN WHEN THE POWER SHUT OFF WAS POST REVENGE THAT WE HAD THE KINCAID FIRE WHEN I WOKE UP EVERY MORNING. SEEING HUNDRED FOOT FLAMES LESS THAN TWO MILES AWAY FROM MY HOME EVERY DAY. SO AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO MAKE SURE. THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS I APPRECIATE THE COMMISSION TODAY BUT I WASN'T STANDING IN LINE I'M GOING THROUGH. AND TAKING THE PS PS CALL THIS COMING AT FOUR AM WEDNESDAY MORNING IN LAKE CONTY.

AND YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THEIR MAKE SURE YOU'RE APPROACHING THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WHO HAVE EQUIPMENT THAT'S ON THEIR FOOD ON THEIR PROPERTIES AND PROBABLY. FORTY YEARS OLD THE NEED TO BE REPLACED THESE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE. WE'VE SENT MULTIPLE LETTERS FROM THE CITY. BOTH CITY OF CLEAR LAKE IN LAKE ANALLY COUNTY AS ONE TO LET YOU KNOW THE IMPACTS. BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING THANK YOU SIR FROM A TRIBAL GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT. THERE IS NO REPRESENTATION I SAW EVERYTHING ELSE REPRESENTED IN THIS STATE SIDE GOVERNMENT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ON THAT PANEL THAT SET UP THERE TODAY. WHEN YOU TURN OUT THE LIGHTS IN THIS STATE SPECIALLY IN LAKE COUNTY. THEY COME TO THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS LOOK FOR SHELTER. JUST LIKE THEY DID AFTER THE FIRES AND WILL CONTINUE DOING THAT BUT YOU NEED TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT HELPS EVERYONE. AND HELPS IS COMMUNITY MOVE FORWARD FOR THE POOREST COUNTY IN THE STATE. AND WE NEED HELP GETTING UP AFTER EACH ONE OF THESE DISASTERS. POINTED TO P. GINNY AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHAT'S COME UP WITH A SOLUTION WORK TOGETHER. WE WILL COME WITH SOLUTIONS TO SENATOR REQUIRE.

WE DO HAVE THE SOLUTIONS TODAY WE ARE READY TO PLAY THEM TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THAT NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT TO ANSWER CENTER HUESO WAS THAT YES WE CAN DEPLOY A BACKUP POWER IN ALL FACILITIES IN THE NEXT YEAR. THERE'S A PROGRAM AVAILABLE FOR IT IT IS EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE SHOULD BE FULLY FUNDING IT- I AM HEARING IN THE SB THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE IMPLEMENTATION PROCEEDING A LOT OF PUSH BACK. FROM MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS- AND YOU CAN READ THE COMMENTS I WON'T NAME THEM ALL INDIVIDUALLY ABOUT COST SHIFTING. AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT CREATE TARIFFS AND READ AND GO AND INCENTIVES FOR MICROGRAMS BECAUSE OF COST SHIFTING THAT MAY OCCUR. IF I DIDN'T HEAR COST SHIFTING TODAY IN ALL OF THESE PRESENTATIONS I DON'T KNOW WHAT COST SHIFTING IS. THE FACT THE UTILITIES AND MANY OTHER PARTIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT COST SHIFTING OF ALLOCATION. OF COST ALLOCATIONS FROM ALL OF THE FROM THE UTILITIES. IT'S JUST NOT WELL PLACE ANYMORE- SECOND ON PERFORMANCE BASED REGULATION. IF WE HAD PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR INNER CONNECTION OF DISTRIBUTE ENERGY RESOURCES I THINK THAT WOULD BETTER ALIGN THE FINANCIAL MOTIVATIONS WITH THE NEED TO INTERCONNECT TO ST ENERGY RESOURCES BEHIND THE METER. THAT ALL CUSTOMERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. YOU ALL KNOW WHO I AM I'M HERE IS A RESOURCE FOR YOU PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME IS THAT WE CAN HOUSE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MY GRADES.
