00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:40.838

FUNDING SIMILAR TO ALL THE

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:21.585
EARLY ACTION WAS ALLOCATED. BUT

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:23.920

ESPECIALLY CONSERVANCIES TO OUR

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:47.511

JUST ONE LAST COMMENT SO THAT

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:09.533
THAT'S NOT SATISFACTORY TO ME.

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:11.034
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHICH

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:12.636
WE STATED LAST WEEK WAS THAT

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:15.071
CAL FIRE IS TAKING DOING THEIR

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.840
JOB WHICH I LOVE THOSE PEOPLE I

GOT A LOT OF THEM CALLING ME

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:20.110
LAST WEEK SAYING. YOU KNOW I

THEM THEY HAVE A JOB DOING OR

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:24.448
DOING IT. BUT OUR JOB IS TO

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:25.615
MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP OUR

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:27.284
COMMUNITY SAFE AND WE HAVE.

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.052
MORE MONEY THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:29.586
IN THIS STATE AND WE JUST

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:31.221
SIMPLY CAN'T GET IT OUT. I HAVE

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:33.457
PROJECTS AVAILABLE. THAT ARE

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:35.358
NOT FUNDED MY CONSERVANCIES.

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:37.928
AND MY FIRE SAFE COUNCILS- THE

00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:39.596
CONSERVANCY'S ALLOCATED THEM OF

00:51:39.663 --> 00:51:40.931
FUNDS YOU JUST STATED THAT

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:41.832
THAT'S CORRECT WHY DON'T WE

00:51:41.898 --> 00:51:43.900
GIVE THEM THE MORE FUN MORE FUN

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:46.203
SO THEY CAN ALLOCATE HIM. IF

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:47.504
CAL FIRE'S NOT ABLE TO DO IT

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:48.972
THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:49.973
DRIVE HOME AND TRYING TO FIGURE

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.641
OUT HOW WE DO THAT I'D- BEEN

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:53.543
TALKING WITH MY- CHAIRMAN OF

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:56.780
SUB TO. ALMOST EVERY DAY AND

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:58.615
I'M FINDING MORE PROJECTS THAN

00:51:58.682 --> 00:51:59.883
WHAT I STATED EARLIER THAT I

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.918
WANT TO GET FUNDED. NOT NEXT

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:03.787
YEAR I WANT THEM FUNDED NOW SO

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:06.456
I'M HAVING TO. I UNDERSTAND

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:07.190
WHEN IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.558
THIS BUDGET I'M REALLY

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:09.192
FRUSTRATED THE FACT THAT WE'RE

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:12.262
GONNA NEED. NOT PUT MONEY WHERE

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:13.763
IT NEEDS TO GO I'M SORRY IF

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.599
THIS ONE AGENCY CAN'T GET IT

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:16.099
OUT BUT THERE ARE OTHER

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:18.802
AGENCIES. THAT DO THIS EVERY

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:21.338
DAY. LIKE THE CONSERVANCY'S AND

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:23.340
THEY- THEY WORK WITH ARE FIRE

00:52:23.406 --> 00:52:24.975
SAFE COUNCILS ARE CD'S AND

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:27.043
THEY'RE READY TO DO IT SO. FOR

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.411
THE LIFE OF ME I'M I'M VERY

00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:29.646
FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW THAT WE

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:30.747
CAN'T PUT THIS MONEY TO GROUND

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:31.748
WE'RE GONNA WAIT WE'RE GONNA

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:34.150
TAKE A RECESS. AND THEY WERE

00:52:34.217 --> 00:52:34.784
GONNA TRY TO FIGURE OUT SO IT'S

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:36.019
GOING TO BE SEPTEMBER. TWO

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:38.321
MONTHS PROBABLY BEFORE. WE GET

00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:39.456
MONEY ON THE GROUND AND THEN

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:41.658
IT'LL BE IN THE FALL. SO THAT'S

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:43.059
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF ONE

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:44.728
AGENCY IS NOT ABLE TO DO IT.

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:45.829

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:47.731
REDIRECT THOSE FUNDS. TO THE

00:52:47.797 --> 00:52:48.965
AGENCIES THEY CAN GET IT DONE

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:50.233
THIS IS THE END OF THE DAY.

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.335
WE'RE STILL DOING THE RIGHT

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:52.903

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:34.477
PAYMENT SAID THE ARREARS IT

00:53:34.544 --> 00:53:36.079
MAKES IT CLEAR THAT ALSO

00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:37.581
EXTENDS TO THE SEWER DISTRICT

00:53:37.647 --> 00:53:39.749

DROUGHT- WE HAVE BEEN IN

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:47.257
CONVERSATIONS. IT'S WHAT'S NOT

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:48.758

RESILIENCY PACKAGE AND ALSO THE

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:53.396
WILDFIRE- I WILL SAY SIERRA

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:55.365
NEVADA DID GET SIXTY MILLION

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:56.900
DOLLARS AND EARLY ACTION AND

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:58.234
THE OTHER CONSERVANCY'S GOT THE

00:53:58.301 --> 00:54:00.704
MONEY THE WORD ON THE STREET IS

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:02.105
THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED ALL

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:03.640
THAT MONEY TO FIGHT TWO

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.542
PACKAGES AND THAT WAS WHAT PART

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:06.676
OF OUR THINKING HERE IN THE

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.178
SENATE WAS THAT WE KNEW.

00:54:08.244 --> 00:54:09.913
CONSERVANCIES IN PARKS AND FISH

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.748

00:54:11.815 --> 00:54:13.984
OF THINGS TO GO ON SO LOTS OF

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.386
PROJECTS THE PESO ONE OF THE

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:17.754
THINGS THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE

00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:19.589
WILL BE LOOKING AT IS WE'VE

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:21.524
MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ON A

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:24.661
BILLION DOLLARS- ON SPENDING.

00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:26.363
IT LOOKS IS THAT WITH THE FIVE

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:29.232
pHAS WE'RE UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:31.234
AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:33.303
SO THERE'S A DELTA THERE OF

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.238
NUMBERS THAT ARE BETTER OFF

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:37.140
BUT- WE'RE GETTING A LAY OF THE

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:39.042
LAND OF HOW WITH THAT

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:41.011
COMBINATION OF MIX DO WE GIVE

00:54:41.077 --> 00:54:42.345

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:17.480
IMPORTANT PILOT PROGRAM ON

RECYCLING THAT WE NEED TO DO

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.984
AND FOR THE AG COMMUNITY

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:23.219
LEADERS WERE ACTUALLY GIVEN THE

00:55:26.956 --> 00:55:27.457
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:29.292

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:45.555
A HUNDRED THIS IS THE NOT A LOT

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.423
OF DETAIL AT LEAST I COULD FIND

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.825
IN THIS. ABOUT ACTUALLY HOW

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:51.594
THIS IS GONNA WORK- I

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:54.931
UNDERSTAND THAT THE. THE

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:57.900
UTILITIES ARE. NOT OUR FRIENDS

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.502
THEY DON'T USE OUR RESOURCES

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:01.537
AND THEY DON'T HOOK UP PEOPLE

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:02.538
AND THEY ONLY GO WHERE THEY CAN

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:04.273
MAKE MONEY AND SO I UNDERSTAND

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.909
WHAT THE PROCESS HERE IS JUST

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:09.278
AS FAR AS- TRYING TO. DO

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:10.546
SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY SERVES

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:12.648
THE PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT A

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:14.417
HUNDRED BY MEGABYTES PER SECOND

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.185
DOWNLOAD IS FAR MORE THAN MOST

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:18.054
PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE. IN THIS

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:18.888
BILL THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:21.791
STANDARD FOR UNDER ORDERS. FOR

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:24.126
SERVER UNDERSERVED TWENTY FIVE

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:25.027
THREE SEEMS MORE LIKE AN ACTOR

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:26.495
STANDARD FOR TRULY ON UNDER

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:30.366
SERVED. FOR THE LAST MILE RULE

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.034
FUNDING FORMULA- WAS A HUNDRED.

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:34.370
MEGABYTES PER SECOND THE

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.438
THRESHOLD CHOSEN FOR

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:37.707
PRIORITIZING DISTRIBUTION OF

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:39.508
THAT ONE HUNDRED BILLION AND

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:43.145
NOT THE TWENTY FIVE THREE. SO I

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.780
THINK THIS IS GONNA BE THE

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:47.650
RITUALLY UNDERSERVED ARE GONNA

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:48.251
TRY TO MEET A HIGHER STANDARD

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:51.654
THAN WHAT. A STANDARD OF TWENTY

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:52.288
FIVE THREE WOULD BE SO CAN YOU

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:53.756
KIND OF GIVE ME SOME. THOUGHT

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.358
PROCESS ABOUT HOW YOU GOT. TO

01:04:55.424 --> 01:05:01.697
THAT. CALCULATION. ALI I WILL

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:02.798
TURN THE QUESTION OVER TO ONE

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.300
OF MY COLLEAGUES- WHO'S BEEN

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:07.336
WORKING ON BROADBAND. YOUR

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:11.340
FINANCE AND- THE SO AS IT IS I

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:16.078
THINK- THIS IS ALREADY NOTED-

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:16.712
THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING FOR

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:19.248
THIS. PROPOSAL COMES FROM THE

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:21.550
ARC OF FUNDS AND SO- TO A

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:23.019
CERTAIN EXTENT SUCCESS SO THEY

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:25.021
HAVE THE HUNDRED DOWN CERTAINLY

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:27.823
IS PART OF THE- WHAT'S THE

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.559
FEDERAL BIKE US TO PURSUE- BUT

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:33.763
IN GENERAL- YOU KNOW WORKING

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:36.265
WITH- YEAH. THE PUBLIC

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.567
UTILITIES COMMISSION AND- AND

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:40.002
YOU KNOW OTHER INDUSTRY EXPERTS

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:43.606
A HUNDRED- HUNDRED DOWN IS-

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:44.307
THAT SAID IT'S A GOOD FUTURE

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.776
PROOF MEASURE- AND IT'S AND

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.244
IT'S SOMETHING THE STOCKMARKET

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:52.148
TECHNOLOGICALLY ACHIEVABLE. SO

01:05:52.214 --> 01:05:55.618
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- MMHM WHEN

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:58.120
WE TALK ABOUT THE WORK OF

01:05:58.187 --> 01:05:59.722
COURSE BUT THE MIDDLE MILE AND

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:02.825
LAST MILE AND SO- BUT THE

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:05.628
TARGET REALLY IS- TO IDENTIFY

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:07.229
FIRST TO THOSE WHO ARE ON THE

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:10.566
SERVER AND SO REFERENCE TO

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:11.167
TWENTY FIVE SIX AND IF IT IS

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:14.136
THAT- THAT'S A SERVICE THAT'S

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:18.808
NOT FAST ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR-

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.409
YOU MULTIPLE USERS THE WAY THAT

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:22.345
I THINK PEOPLE IT'S NOW BECOME-

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:24.814
USED TO R. AND HAD TO GET USED

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.083
TO. THE CODE AND EVERYTHING AND

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:29.719
SO THE IDEA FOR THE TWENTY FIVE

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:35.091
DOWN IS THAT- ANYTHING BELOW

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:35.858
THAT IS NOT. IT'S NOT FUN OR

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:38.094
NOT AND SO AS FUND PROJECTS WE

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.062
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.964
PROJECTS ARE ABLE TO OPERATE AT

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:44.333
THE HUNDRED LEVEL. BUT I WOULD

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.535
JUST SHARE WITH YOU THAT IS AN

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:49.305
AREA I'VE WORKED A LOT AND- A

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:50.639
HUNDRED MEGABYTES PER SECOND

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:52.408
VERSUS TWENTY FIVE SO THAT

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:53.542
MEANS THAT ANYBODY THAT HAS

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:54.777
TWENTY FIVE OR- OR IS UNDER A

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.579
HUNDRED. IS CONSIDERED

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.214
UNDERSERVED SO THAT MEANS THAT

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.915
THEY HAVE SOMETHING IF THEY IF

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:02.585
THEY'RE- TWENTY FIVE OR- ABOVE

01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:03.552
IF YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE BELOW IF

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.221
YOU HAVE NOTHING. HE WOULD BE

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:06.822
HAPPY TO HAVE TWENTY FIVE THREE

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.357
AND THAT'S MY POINT IS THAT

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:08.958
MOST THIS MONEY'S GONNA GO TO

01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:11.927
AREAS THAT. R. HAVE SERVICE BUT

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:14.563
JUST NOT A HUNDRED. AND THAT

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.065
THAT'S GOING TO CARVE OUT A

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.200
WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN IN

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:19.602
VERY IN AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.137
HAVE IT SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:22.705
THAT THAT POLICY AND HOW IT

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:24.273
GETS HOW IT PLAYS OUT WHEN WE

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.841
EXPANDED I UNDERSTAND WE GOT TO

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:26.776
GET THIS ON THE GROUND WE GOT

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:28.310
TO GET IT DONE BECAUSE THIS IS.

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.780
FEDERAL DOLLARS- SO I THINK

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:32.481
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.583
AT MAYBE IN SOME FOLLOW UP

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.018
LANGUAGE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:37.820
MISS A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.688
THAT ARE NOT SERVED AND WE'RE

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:41.524
GONNA SPEED UP PEOPLE'S

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:42.758
SERVICES THAT ALREADY ARE

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:44.059
SERVED. I THINK THAT'S A

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.795
PROBLEM WITH THIS PIECE A

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.663
LETTER WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.498
OTHER THING I WANT TO ASK ABOUT

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:52.935
IS THE MIDDLE MILE. WHEN YOU

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:54.703
WHEN YOU WHEN THAT WHISTLE

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:57.339
GONNA BE A GOVERNMENT RAN.

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:58.908
INTERNET SERVICE THIS IS THIS

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:01.143
IS DONE BY THE FUNDS ARE COMING

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:02.978
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:03.612
FROM THE STATE FUNDS THAT WE'RE

01:08:03.679 --> 01:08:07.850
PUTTING IN. AND ALL THE

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.418
MONOPOLIES THAT WE HAVE THE

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:10.519
FIVE BIG MONOPOLIES THAT DON'T

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.755
HELP US OUT WHICH IS EIGHTEEN

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:16.859
T. VERIZON- SPRINT. AND ALL THE

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.694
BIG UTILITIES OUT THERE THAT

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:19.395
THAT HAVE ALL THIS

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:21.063
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE'RE GONNA

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.798
PUT THE MIDDLE MILE IN BUT WHO

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:25.067
WERE WHO WERE GONNA HOOK UP TO.

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:25.668
AND WE'RE GONNA TRY TO HOOK UP

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:29.472
TO THEIR- TO THEIR SOURCE. AND

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:32.842
THEN OFFERED. TO THEIR

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:33.375
CUSTOMERS I DON'T BELIEVE

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:35.911
THEY'RE GOING TO BE WANTING TO

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.881
PARTICIPATE. IN LETTING US GET

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.015
ON THIS BACKBONE IT'S THE

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.317
BACKBONE IS NOT OWNED BY THE

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:43.152
PUBLIC IT'S OWNED BY PRIVATE

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:44.553
COMPANIES AND IF WE'RE GONNA

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.855
PUT THE MIDDLE MILE AND THEN

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:46.655
TRY TO HOOK UP TO THAT AND GO

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:48.324
OUT AND SERVE UNDERSERVED

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:49.859
COMMUNITIES I DON'T SEE WHAT

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:51.026
THE INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO BE

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:53.429
ABLE. TO LET US COOK IN THE

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:53.996
BACK OF THE HOUSE THAT GONNA

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:57.466
WORK. YES SO- PART OF THE

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.768
TROUBLE DOES IS IT PROVIDES FOR

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:01.904
A- THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:05.474
THAT HAS- BROAD EXPERIENCE IN

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:09.311
THE IN THIS- IN THIS INDUSTRY-

01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:13.015
AND SO- BUT BUT THE INTENT IS

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:16.919
REALLY TO- TO BUILD OUR TRIP

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:20.189
TO- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:25.294
AN OPEN ACCESS- LITTLE MILD

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:27.296
THAT DOES THAT TIES INTO THE

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:30.366
BAN LAST MILE. COMMUNITIES CAN

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:41.410
TIE INTO. AND SO- THE- SO THE-

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:42.978
INDUSTRY AND THAT THAT THEY

01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:44.346
CURRENTLY HAS- INFRASTRUCTURE

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:46.282
THERE- CERTAINLY WE WANT TO

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:46.949
BUILD SOMETHIN WE DON'T NEED A

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:51.186
BILL RIGHT AND SO- THE- WE

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:52.655
WOULD WORK WITH INDUSTRY WE

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:53.622
WOULD WORK THROUGH A THIRD

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.492
PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- AND THEN

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:58.394
TRY TO USE WHAT'S AVAILABLE WHO

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.796
CAN GET LONG TERM ACCESS TO IT-

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:03.198
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT- THAT

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:06.835
WERE UNABLE TO GET THAT THEN WE

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:09.705
WOULD NEED TO- THEN. WE NEED TO

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:11.974
GO AHEAD AND BUILD- BUILD OUT

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.475
THE SYSTEM THERE SO THAT IN THE

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.710
END WE HAVE A MIDDLE MILE

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:16.579
SYSTEM THAT REACHES ALL OF THE

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:18.213
COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. WELL

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.716
I WOULD SAY THAT. WE'RE GONNA

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:24.086
PUT MIDDLE MILE. RIGHT

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:27.289
ALONGSIDE A PRIVATE PROVIDERS

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:31.260
MIDDLE MILE. I HAVE IT THROUGH

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:32.494
ALL THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT AND

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:33.262
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN VERY

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:35.397
FRUSTRATED WITH THE UTILITIES

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.433
IS I'VE SAID IT THREE TIMES ON

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:39.134
THIS FLOOR WE HAVE THE I. FIVE

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:41.036
QUARTER GOES ALL THE WAY FROM

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:43.105
CALIFORNIA TO WASHINGTON AND

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:45.441
THERE'S FIBER LAID. LOTS OF

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:46.375
FIBER LAID RIGHT UP THROUGH

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:48.010
THERE AND A LOT OF IT ALONG THE

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.112
RAILROAD LINES AS WELL. AND

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.680
THEY DON'T ALLOW ME TO TAP INTO

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:52.514
IT SO THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.350
ALLOW YOU TO TAP INTO THAT

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.885
SOMEWHERE. TO HOOK UP MY

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:57.920
COMMUNITY BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.254
MIDDLE MAN THAT'S THERE BUT YOU

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:00.789
GOT IT CONNECTED THERE'S BEEN

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:01.957
ON RAMP. THERE'S BEEN OFFERING

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:03.792
UP. TO GET THE ON RAMP YOU HAVE

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:04.560
TO TAKE IT FROM SOMEBODY'S

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.862
PRIVATE. SOME PRIVATE COMPANIES

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.697
BACKBONE. THAT'S THE CONCERN I

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:10.199
PASSED EARLIER. BUT YOU'RE

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:10.799
BASICALLY SAYING WE'RE GONNA

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.735
BUILD OUR OWN NETWORK RIGHT

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:15.704

INITIATIVE THAT HAS BEEN

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.761
LAUNCHED. IN PARTICULAR FOR

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:14.329
RURAL CALIFORNIA. IN OVER A

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:18.434

BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH IN RURAL

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.341
CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:28.110
MIDDLE MILE. DIRT LITERALLY

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.979
THOUSANDS OF MIDDLE MILE LINES

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:31.447
THAT RUN THROUGH RURAL

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:34.883
CALIFORNIA. THE INCUMBENTS ONLY

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.319
ACCESS TO THAT MIDDLE MILE.

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:40.055
THEY FORCE SOME OF THE POOREST

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:42.224
COMMUNITIES IN AMERICA TO PAY

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:46.161
EXORBITANT FEES TO TAP INTO A-

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:46.729
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SIMPLY

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:51.867
CAN'T AFFORD IT. WHICH MEANS.

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:54.303
WE HAVE A HUGE SWATHS OF THE

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:56.371
STATE THAT ARE UNDERSERVED WHEN

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:58.674
IT COMES TO NOT JUST ON NOT NOT

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.676
JUST HI SPEED INTERNET BUT EVEN

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:05.547
DIAL UP. SO IS IT RIDICULOUS

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:06.381
THAT THIS STATE IS GOING TO

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:09.051
HAVE TO BUILD A SECOND LINE

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:11.053
REDUNDANT LYING NEXT TO

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.055
INCUMBENT LYING YOU'RE RIGHT IT

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:15.724
IS BUT WE'RE NOT IN IT FOR THE

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:17.793
PROFIT. THIS STATE IS IN IT FOR

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:21.096
THE PEOPLE. AND MORE

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.532
COMPETITION WILL BRING DOWN THE

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:25.000
PRICES FOR EVERYONE IN THE

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:29.671
STATE. THERE'S THREE POINT TWO

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:31.240
FIVE BILLION FOR MIDDLE MILE

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:32.808
THAT HIGH CAPACITY FIBER LINE

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:36.078
THAT IS THE HIGHWAY- OF WHAT

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:38.347
WILL BE ONE OF AMERICA'S

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:41.450
LARGEST BROADBAND PROJECTS- I

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:42.851
KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR THE

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:44.286
LEGISLATURE IS VERY FOCUSED ON

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:46.789
BRINGING ON AN EXPERIENCED

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:47.990
NONPROFIT TO BE ABLE TO OVERSEE

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:50.159
IT. AND RIGHTFULLY SO IT IS

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:51.126
GOING TO HAVE A WORSE FOR

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:53.228
STRATEGY WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:55.063
THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE SERVICE

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:57.432
FIRST THEN GO TO LOWES WHO ARE

01:13:57.499 --> 01:13:59.468
UNDERSERVED. IN THE REASON WHY

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:01.236
WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO POINT SEVEN

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:03.305
FIVE BILLION FOR LAST MILE IS

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:05.274
TO ALLOW FOR COMMUNITIES TO BE

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.508
ABLE TO BUILD OUT THEIR OWN

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:08.343
SYSTEMS THREE TO CONNECT TO

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:11.413
