THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR ACCOMMODATING. MY REQUESTS AND THANK YOU. TIM THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. OF THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN TODAY. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY WOULD ALLOW VETERINARIANS TO DISCUSS THE USE OF CANNABIS WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR LICENSE. AND ENABLES CANNABIS FOR MEDICINAL ANIMAL USE TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATED DISPENSARIES. TODAY CALIFORNIANS HAVE UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO CANNABIS CONSUMERS ALREADY HAD THE ABILITY TO GET THEIR PETS CANNABIS WITHOUT VETERINARIAN DISCUSSION. CONTRA CONTRA WIDELY HELD KNOWLEDGE. VETERINARIANS DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT POSITIONS ARE GIVEN. SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER VETERINARIANS WAS BE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE. OR PROSECUTION IF THIRD TO DISCUSS THE USE OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS ON ANIMAL WITHIN THE VETERINARIAN CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. IT IS CRITICAL FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR BELOVED PETS THAT VETERINARIAN'S BE ALLOWED TO DISCUSS THE SAFE USE AND MEDICINAL VALUE OF CANADA'S PRODUCTS. ALREADY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. EVEN THOUGH OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD HAS NO POSITION ON THE BILL A WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING. TO WORK WITH THEM AS A BILL MOVES FORWARD. THIS FIRST STEP OF ALLOWING FOR DISCUSSION IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM SUPPORT WITNESSES FROM THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING LICENSED. VETERINARIANS. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN ALSO REQUIRES THE BOARD TO ESTABLISH GUIDELINES FOR LICENSE VETERINARIANS THAT CAN BE THE BASIS FOR DISCUSSIONS ON THE USE OF CANNABIS ON AN ANIMAL PATIENT. SOME ARE GUIDELINES FOR POSITIONS WERE RECOMMENDING CANNABIS WERE DEVELOPED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. LASTLY TO ENSURE CANNABIS PRODUCTS WERE MEDICINAL USE ON ANIMALS CAN BE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS IN A REGULATED MARKET. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN AS THESE PRODUCTS TO THE DEFINITION UNDER THE MEDICINAL ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT. THIS WILL ENABLE CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO COME TO MARKET THAT ARE SAFE FOR PET USE RATHER THAN PET OWNERS USING CAMERAS PRODUCTS DESIGNED. FOR HUMAN USE ON THEIR PETS AND FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND WE HAVE WELL IF WE COULD MISTER CHAIR ONE WITNESS A CURE TODAY DR CABIN LAZAR CHEF. OF THE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS CRISTINA CARL HERE FOR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OF THE MORNING WHO'S CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE I'M DUCK KEVIN LAZAR CHEF ON PRESIDENT THAT CALIFORNIA BETTER MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THIS YEAR.

IT'S TRULY A SIGN OF THE TIMES THAT EARNINGS WILL TELL YOU THAT THEIR CLIENTS ARE COMING IN. TO THEIR OFFICES WEEKLY WITH STORIES ABOUT IT CANNABIS USE IN THEIR PETS. EITHER DOGS ACCIDENTALLY CONSUMED A POT EDIBLE. AND IS VERY SICK OR THE CLIENT WANTS TO TALK ABOUT CBD OIL FOR THEIR PETS ARTHRITIC HIP. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE ATTORNEY FOR THE VERY MEDICAL BOARD. THE PINE THAT THE IN MEMORANDUM THAT CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THAT EARNINGS TO EVEN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT CANNABIS. TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. OF OUR ANIMAL PATIENTS. BRINKLEY THINK THIS IS THE APPLICATION OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS HEALTH PRACTITIONERS. TO NOT HAVE THESE OPEN AND HONEST DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR CLIENTS. IT'S PRETTY FRIGHTENING WHEN THE CLIENTS NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF INFORMATION. IS THE INTERNET. OR THEIR LOCAL BUT TENDER THE CANNABIS DISPENSARY. THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO BETTER MADE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. THIS IS WHY ASSEMBLY COLLARS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT TO US. AB TWENTY TO FIFTEEN ALLOW THEIR NAMES TO HAVE A CLINICAL DISCUSSION. WITH OUR PETS OWNERS WITHOUT HAVING TO. FEAR BEING SANCTIONED BY AFARIA MEDICAL BOARD. EVEN THE VM. BE OPINION. SUGGEST THAT LEGISLATOR LEGISLATIVE REMEDIES THE ONLY WAY TO ADDRESS THIS CURRENT VOIDING LAW.

CARILLO GET AND TOTAL OPPOSITION FOR PETS. PETS ARE SICK FROM EVEN USE IN IT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON. SO IT'S UNFAIR THAT'S ANIMAL ABUSE. THANK THAT YOU VERY MUCH CLICKS INDIVIDUAL PLEASE. GOOD MORNING PAUL HAS VERY MENDOCINO COUNTY. FOR MANY YEARS YOU KNOW MY PARTNER AND I HAVE BEEN ACTIVISTS ATTEMPTING TO. EDUCATE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE. OR FOR AND TO HELP SHAPE THE RESTRICTIVE AND SOMETIMES ONEROUS AND SEEMINGLY PUNITIVE. OF REGULATIONS AND LAWS CONCERNING MEDICAL CANNABIS. IT FEELS STRANGE TO BE HERE TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO A BILL THAT AT THE HEART OF THE MATTER. IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT IT HAS NO LEGS ARMS OR HEAD. PROP SIXTY FOUR ALLOWS ACCESS TO ANYONE OVER TWENTY ONE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A TOXIC DOES NO MATTER HOW WELL INTENTIONED. BEING GIVEN TO A PET THE NAME A MEDICAL CANNABIS IS EXTREMELY HIGH. PET OWNERS AT LEAST DESERVE THE THE OPTION OF GETTING INFORMED RECOMMENDATION. NOT JUST DISCUSSION. FROM A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL REGARDING THE DOSAGE AND HOUSE TO SAFELY ADMINISTER THE MEDICAL CANNABIS. HEADER MIS INFORMATION FROM THE INTERNET OR ADVICE FROM A REAL RETAIL SALES PERSON IS SIMPLY INADEQUATE. AND WHEN A FAMILY MEMBERS HEALTH AND WELL BEING IS AT STAKE. WHILE THE COURSES ARE AFFECTED AYE WISPY TO CONTINUING EDUCATION. WHAT COURSES ARE BE ARE? OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IS A REQUIREMENT. AS IT IS WITH MEDICAL DOCTORS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR LICENSE ACTIVE. IF A VETERINARIAN CHOOSES TO INCORPORATE THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS INTO THEIR PRACTICE IT ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR DISCUSSION WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO RECOMMEND. THE SIMPLY JUST HAD IT SAYS THE VETERINARIANS HAVE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. ALLOWING CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO BE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD FOR ANIMALS IT BOLSTERS THE MARKET NO DOUBT. BUT THERE'S NO SAFETY PRECAUTIONS OF FOR THE ANIMALS. THE MEDICAL ONLY RETAIL OUTLETS IS GREAT. BUT WHAT IF THE CLIENT. THE CAREGIVER FOR THE PET. DOES NOT HAVE A RECOMMENDATION FROM THEIR FAMILY MET FAMILY DOCTOR. THE EASY ANSWER IS TO ALLOW THAT PRODUCTS IN RECREATIONAL OUTLETS THERE IS NO RECREATIONAL USE FOR ANIMALS. THIS WOULD MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE. WHAT WOULD BE UNETHICAL TO SHARE THE CLIENT INFORMATION VETERANS ARE NOT BOUND BY HIPAA PRIVACY LAWS FOR THEIR PATIENTS? WHAT BETTER WAY TO COLLECT DATA FOR A BODY OF EVIDENCE TO DRIVE RESEARCH FOR THE TRIALS THERE ARE ALWAYS A I ASK FOR AND DESPERATELY NEEDED? THERE'S A LOT OF LANGUAGE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THIS BILL SOME WOULD SAY IT'S A GOOD START WE WOULD SAY LET'S GET IT RIGHT AND THEN BUILD ON THAT LEADER. WE WOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL OF LANGUAGE AT A MINIMUM WORK TO INCLUDE A VETERINARY RECOMMENDATIONS WITH CONTINUING PROVIDED THEY'VE. OF FINISHED THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION COMPLETED CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE. ALEX CANNABIS MEDICINE. NUMBER TWO REQUIRE VETERAN VETERINARY RECOMMENDATION TO HER MIND THAT IRAQ HAVE THIS HOT AT LEAST. THIS WOULD ENSURE SAFETY FOR THE ANIMAL FURTHER THE PROFESSION FURTHER RESEARCH AND ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIBLE DO PRODUCT FOR MEDICINE. LET'S START TREATING MEDICAL CANNABIS AS MEDICINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WOODS IS UNDER ME TO KNOW THAT OUR THREE MINUTES ARE UP. GOOD MORNING SUSAN TIBBON FORMER CURRICULUM WRITER AN INSTRUCTOR SAN FRANCISCO SPCA CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

THAT THAT THE MEMBERS ABOUT AYE ALLEN TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUMMER KALRA WILL TAKE A VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND IF YOU WISH TO MOVE ON AT TO COMPLETE A FILE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR. SPECTER COURT REPORTERS. AND AGAIN. THROUGH UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES. IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST ONCE AGAIN. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WOULD REQUIRE ENTITIES PROVIDING PURPORTING SERVICES TO REGISTER WITH THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD AS COURT REPORTING PROVIDERS. IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT DICTATE FAIR AND NEUTRAL COURT REPORTING. COR REPORTING IS INTEGRAL A COMPONENT OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS THE ROLE IT IS THE ROLE OF THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD PROTECTS INTEGRITY BY MAKING SURE ALL ENTITIES ARE PLAYING BY THE SAME RULES. THIS ENSURES CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED FROM ACTIONS THEY GIVE ONE SIDE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OR PRACTICES THAT COMPROMISE THE NEUTRAL CARE OF THE COURT REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPT. THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTED ABUSES FROM OUT OF SE CORPORATIONS THE PROVIDE COURT REPORTING FOR DEPOSITIONS. THESE ENTITIES USE LICENSE COURT REPORTERS BUT IN THE COURSE OF THEIR BUSINESS HAVE DIRECT HANDLING OF THE TRANSCRIPT IN A MANNER THAT BREAKS COURT REPORTING LAWS REGULATIONS. ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS INVOLVES TRANSCRIPT DELIVERY. DURING WHICH THE FIRM WILL PROVIDE THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE CLIENT BEFORE OPPOSING COUNSEL. GIVING A SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ADVANTAGE A TO THEIR CLIENT CONTRARY TO EXISTING LAW. AS SOMEONE THE PRACTICE OF RELIGION YEARS DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER AND RELIED HEAVILY ON NOT JUST THE WORLD COURT REPORTERS BUT THE TRANSCRIPTS I CAN TELL YOU THAT. ANY KIND OF INCONSISTENCY ABOVE A IN THE HANDLING OF TRANSCRIPTS. POSES A GRAVE RISK OF THE TWO EQUITY IN THE COURT SYSTEM. WITHOUT HOLDING ALL ENTITIES THE SAME LAWS REGULATION A CREATES INEQUITIES IN THE PROVISION OF COURT REPORTING SERVICES. AND UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. AB TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR RESPONSE BY THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD AND SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION. AND THE DEPTH OF THE DEPOSITION REPORTERS ASSOCIATION. AB. AND. LOOKING TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES BONVENTRE CHAIR THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD AS WELL AS JIM GROSS ON BEHALF THE DEPOSITIONS. I REPORTERS ASSOCIATION US ONE OF AND BY SAYING I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US SINCE LAST YEAR ON THIS UP PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT ACKNOWLEDGMENT UP TO THREE MINUTES IT'S FOUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. MY NAME IS YVONNE FENNER I'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD ON I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR BOARD CHAIR READING UNEXPECTED EMERGE EMERGENCY THIS MORNING SO. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M THIS ARTICULATE BUT THESE ARE HER REMARKS BOB SHE WANTED ME TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. WE REALLY APPRECIATE BRINGING FORWARD TO YOU AN UNCOMPLICATED WELL VETTED FISCALLY SMART SOLUTION IN AB TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL CONSUMERS OF COURT REPORTING SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA ARE PROTECTED. WHETHER THE SECURE THOSE SERVICES THROUGH A LICENSEE OWNED FIRM ANON LICENSEE OWNED FIRM. AND IN STATE CORPORATION OR AN OUT OF STATE CORPORATION NO ONE SHOULD BE ABOVE THE LAW. WHY WE ARE HERE BECAUSE THAT COURT REPORTERS MISSION IS TO SERVE AND PROTECT THE COURTROOM CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS? AND IT'S BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY GROWING DISREGARD FOR EXISTING LAWS BY OUT OF STATE NON LICENSEE ON FIRMS OFFERING COURT REPORTING SERVICES. COLLECTIVELY REPRESENTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES INCORPORATED. UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRY MEMBERS WHO ARE FOLLOWING COURT REPORTING LAWS AND ETHICS A COLLECTION OF THESE OUT OF STATE FIRMS HAVE TRIED TO REWRITE EXISTING LAWS BY SAYING WE ARE SOMEHOW EXEMPT. SO THE BOARD BOARD IS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND AB TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR PROVIDES A CLEAR PATHWAY FOR THESE OUT OF STATE CORPORATIONS TO OFFER COURT REPORTING SERVICES WHY BEING WHILE BEING HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS. SO WE WELCOME COMPETITION TO THE STATE COMPETITION IS GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER. BUT WE DON REALLY BELIEVE EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD AND WE ASKFOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. JIM GROWS UP AFTER THE DEPOSITION REPORTERS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE WORKED ON THIS BILL FOR THE LAST. THREE YEARS AND I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL ALLOW FOR COMPETITION DESPITE WHAT SOME OF THE OPPONENTS HAVE SAID IN THE PAST. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. HE'S NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ AND WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTER SOCIAIS AND. STRONG SUPPORT WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AND ALLIES AND. THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL.

A WE NOW WELCOME WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION A PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE TASK. YOU'LL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MIKE FOLLOWED ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION OF DEPOSITION NATIONAL DEPOSITION FIRMS. INCLUDING VARITEK'S US LEGAL. AND ESQUIRE. THIS BILL IS WELL KNOWN TO THE COMMITTEE AND IT AND STAFF AND MEMBERS OF THE IDENTICAL BILL WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. A IN SEPTEMBER OF WHO ARGUED. THAT A THAT THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO WAIT UNTIL PENDING LITIGATION WAS RESOLVED. WHICH RELATES DIRECTLY TO THE QUESTIONS INVOLVED IN THE BILL. THE GOVERNOR APPARENTLY ALTHOUGH WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T SPEAK FOR HIM. A WAS EXAMINING THE NEED FOR THE BILL. THIS LEGISLATURE AND A LONG HISTORY OF NOT ACTING IN THE FACE OF PENDING LITIGATION. AND THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE SO CALLED MOOSE DECISION. BEAR DIRECTLY ON THE ISSUES INVOLVED IN THIS BILL. SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE BILL BE HELD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF THE MOOSE CASE. SECONDLY. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE NEED FOR THE BILL HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. WE'VE WAITED WEEK LISTEN TO ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF PROBLEMS WE'VE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE. A WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS IN SEARCH OF A IS. GOING AFTER A NONEXISTENT PROBLEM. THERE IS PROBLEMS IN COURT REPORTING AND WE SHOULD BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND I CAN NAME TO WRITE OFF THE TOP. FIRST COURT REPORTERS ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED IN CIVIL LITIGATION IN THE COURTS. FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE DOING WITHOUT COURT REPORTERS AND THE NEED THEM AND THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO ADDRESS THAT. SECOND BUT THERE'S APPARENTLY A GROWING SHORTAGE OF COURT REPORTERS AND YOU MIGHT TAKE A LOOK AT THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE LICENSING OF COURT REPORTERS. SO WE COULD HAVE MORE. SO THERE ARE ISSUES WITH COURT REPORTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ADDRESS THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM. THE BILL WAS VETOED AND THAT HAS PENDING LITIGATION WE WOULD ASK THAT THE BILL BE HELD. UNTIL AND UNLESS THE MOOSE DECISION IS RELEASED AND WE KNOW WHAT THE COURT THINKS ABOUT THESE ISSUES. WITH THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WHAT IS THIS WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEN NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEEING NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALL VOTE YOU WISH TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AGAIN THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF OF HOPE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. AND AS INDICATED. WE WE HAVE BEEN INCOMES IS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WE BELIEVE THAT JUST REGARDLESS WHAT THE OUTCOME IS. IN THE PENDING LITIGATION THAT THE REST OF THE LEGISLATION NEEDED AND THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE LAST YEAR IN SOLID APPRECIATE UP AND PLUGGED UP AN AYE VOTE FROM THE MEMBERS I THINK IF THE RECOMMENDATION WAS A CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUMMER KALRA AS YOU KNOW WE'RE ACTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND WILL TAKE UP THE BILL WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE ONTO ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN WHICH IS A B. THIRTY ONE TEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN. SOME AMONG THEM PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU ARE READY AND AGAIN UP TO THREE MINUTES FOUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND AGAIN JUST A CLARIFICATION FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY AND NO VOTE WILL BE HELD TODAY. WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT AB THIRTY ONE TENT TO UP SIMPLY DISCUSSED THE MERITS OF THE BILL JUST A PRESENTATION OUT TODAY. AT THIS TIME I AM WORKING TO DRAFT AMENDMENTS TO BETTER DEFINE THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS IT IS MY HOPE TO TAKE UP THE BILL FOR A VOTE NEXT WEEK. IN THE MEANTIME I WOULD LIKE TO WALK THE COMMITTEE THROUGH MY INTENT. ON A. B. THIRTY ONE TEN A. B. THIRTY ONE TEN ESTABLISHES THE ATHLETIC TRAINING PRACTICE ACT. THE BILL LICENSES AND REGULATES ATHLETIC TRAINERS UNDER THE ATHLETIC TRAINER LICENSING COMMITTEE. WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT REGULATE THE PROFESSION OF ATHLETIC TRAINING. IT IS A GLARING OMISSION WE ARE THE OUT LIAR IN THE COUNTRY. ATHLETIC TRAINERS OUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE OFTEN CHARGED WITH MANAGING SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS. SUCH AS CONCUSSIONS HEAT ILLNESS SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST AS WELL AS MUSCULOSKELETAL SKELETAL ISSUES LIKE DISLOCATIONS AND FRACTURES. BECAUSE THERE'S NO LICENSING BORDER COMMITTING CALIFORNIA. THERE'S NO ACCURATE SYSTEMIC WAY FOR THE PUBLIC TO REPORT EVIDENCE OF HARM AGAINST ATHLETIC TRAINERS OR THOSE POSING AS ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AND HAVE THOSE REPORTS INVESTIGATED OR TRACKED. THERE'S ONLY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE. AB THIRTY ONE TEN ALSO PROTECTS EMPLOYERS OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND ATHLETIC TRAINERS HEMSELVES CURRENTLY. ATHLETIC TRAINERS WHO HAVE OBTAINED THE PROPER EDUCATION AND TRAINING PRACTICE IN A LEGAL GRAY AREA. WHICH PLACES THEM AT INCREASED RISK OF LIABILITY EMPLOYERS OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS IN SECTORS SUCH AS EDUCATION HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL SPORTS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. OUR CONCERN THAT THERE'S NO STATE SANCTIONED SCOPE OF PRACTICE. TO DELINEATE WHAT AFFLECK ATHLETIC TRAINERS CAN AND CANNOT DO. AND HEALTH CARE SETTINGS ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE OFTEN THE ONLY PROFESSIONALS THESE EMPLOYERS HIRE WHO ARE NOT LICENSE. IS CREATES A LACK OF CERTAINTY THAT INCREASES THE EMPLOYERS RISK OF LIABILITY. ATHLETIC TRAINERS IN SOME SETTINGS ESPECIALLY IN COLLEGIATE PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AND PERFORMING ARTS ARE REQUIRED TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AS PART OF THEIR JOB. IN A GROWING NUMBER OF STATES IT IS ILLEGAL FOR UNREGULATED ATHLETIC TRAINERS TO PRACTICE FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME IN THOSE RESPECTIVE STATES. WHEN I WENT CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS TRAVEL TO THE STATE'S WITH THEIR TEAMS ARE COMPANIES THEY RISK VIOLATING THOSE THE LOSS BECAUSE THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT REGULATED. KAREN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ANYONE CAN ACT AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE ANY EDUCATION IN ATHLETIC TRAINING OR ARE NATIONALLY SERVICE BUT CERTIFIED. THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE I HAVE HERE WITH ME DOCTOR CINDY CHIANG OF UCSF MEDICAL CENTER. IZZY SALAMONE ME AND HIS MOM SIERRA SOMEONE MONEY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AS WELL AS MY CHIU SAR OF THE CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOCIATION WHO IS HERE TO ANSWER YOUR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS DIFFICULT ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF I COULD ASK FOR YOU TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT SO THAT WE CAN CALL OF FOR A QUORUM COMMITTEE SECRETARY WHICH PLEASE CALL THE. WELL. HERE LOW HERE BROWN. ARAMBULA PRISON. BAKER. BLOOM. JOHN. JILL. CUNNINGHAM. EGGMAN. PAUL. GIPSON HERE GRAYSON. HOLDEN. IRWIN. MULLIN PRESENT. TING. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHALL WE NOW HAVE A QUORUM AND JUST AS A REMINDER OF JUST THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND THREE MENACES UP TO THREE MINUTES FOUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE WHEN EVERY RIGHT. HELLO MY NAME IS MIKE CHIPS ARE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOCIATION AND IN THE SEAT MY TIME. AND TO DR CHANG WAS A POSITION EXPERTS WORSE MEDICINE. AND AND IS EVEN. TIMES AND SEROTONIN WHOSE HAD FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH THE MISMANAGED CONCUSSION FROM SOMEONE PRETENDING TO BE AN ATHLETE TRAINER. BUT I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET ME THINK ADVANCE FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION SO I'M AT UCSF ON SPORTS MEDICINE POSITION. I WAS HITTING POSITION AT THE UC BERKELEY I'VE BEEN THE CMO FOR TEAM USA AT PARALYMPIC AN OLYMPIC GAMES. SO I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT. THIS LAW BECAUSE I'M ASTONISHED EMBARRASSED BUT THE FACT THAT WE REMAIN THE ONLY STATE AND NATION THAT DON'T THAT DOESN'T LICENSE AND REGULATE OUR ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AND THIS LACK OF OVERSIGHT IS A SERIOUS THREAT ARE NOT ONLY TO ATHLETES BUT THE PUBLIC AT LARGE A THIRD OF OUR ATHLETIC TRAINERS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED. THEY WORK WITH THE PUBLIC IN VARIOUS A CAPACITY SUCH AS THE MILITARY AND OFF AND WORKPLACE SETTINGS AND ALSO AND CLINICS WITH PHYSICIANS LIKE LIKE WITH ME AT UCSF. AND CURRENTLY ANYONE. WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION CERTIFICATION CAN ACT AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER PROVIDE CARE AND THIS COPYRIGHT OUT CAN YOU CAN RESULT IN DANGEROUS CONDITIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE FROM SURVEYS THAT WE'VE DONE IS ESTIMATED THAT TWENTY PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS OUR HIGH SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW. WHO ACT AS ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE CARE AND THEREFORE POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE EDUCATION? AND HERE'S ANOTHER UNSETTLING FACT THE LACK OF REGULATION MEANS THAT ATHLETIC CHANGE FROM OTHER STATES CAN COME TO OUR STATE THE PRACTICE. BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR ANYBODY TO SAY HEY. THEY PROVIDED AT THAT DANGEROUS SITUATION OTHER STATE HERE THEY ARE IN CALIFORNIA. SO IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE TRUE FACTS. A QUICK ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE CMA OF THE IT WAS A SAM AMSA SAM ALL THESE NATIONAL RESPECT WORDS NATIONS HAVE SAID. THAT THIS LAW WE SUPPORT THIS LAW AND WHY WOULD WE NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL I MEAN THE PROPOSED SCOPE OF PRACTICE. IS IS NOT TOO BROAD FOR THE ATHLETIC SHOES EDUCATION SO THESE RESPECTED ORGANIZATION SUPPORT THIS BILL SUPPORT ATHLETIC TRAINERS LICENSURE AND THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE NO ATTORNEY MOTORS AND THERE'S NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST. AND LASTLY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN YOU PASSED AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN. AND THAT SAID THAT THERE IS A MANDATORY RETURN PLAY PROTOCOL UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AFTER CONCUSSION. WHAT BETTER PERSON TO SUPERVISE THE SAFE RETURN OF SPORT THEN NAPA TRAINER BUT CURRENTLY ATHLETIC TUNERS AREN'T LICENSED IT DOESN'T FIT WITH THIS LAW THAT WAS PASSED SO LET'S? LET'S SUPPORT THIS BILL AND LET'S ALL VOTE. AYE FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. I WAS STRUCK WITH FOUR TIMES IN THE HEAD. LAST YEAR. BECAUSE OF THE MISMANAGEMENT OF. THE ATHLETIC TRAINER I.

NOW LIKE TO CALL UP WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION IF INDIVIDUALS CAN. KILEY CLEAR THE TABLE HERE FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO COME TO THE TABLE. AND AGAIN UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTALITY FOR WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. PLEASE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. BUT YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS IVAN ALL TOMORROW I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA. I'M SORRY THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION THERAPY ASSOCIATION IN THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. ARM WELL WE'RE IN OPPOSE. POSE POSITION ON THIS BILL AND AND I LET ME JUST START BY SAYING I HAVE TWO CHILDREN WHO PLAY HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS AND SO I APPRECIATE. THE IMPORTANCE AND THE NEED FOR HAVING. A LIGHTHOUSE. QUALIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINER AT SPORTING EVENTS AND WE DO NOT OPPOSE ATHLETIC TRAINERS BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. OUR CONCERNS IN THIS BILL ARE ARE TO FALL TO ME JUST START BY. SAYING THE FIRST ONE THAT THIS IN THAT UNDER THIS BILL THE ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE SEEKING TO BE PUT UNDER THE BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AND WE HAVE STRONG. OBJECTIONS TO HAVING ATHLETIC TRAINING BE PART OF THE BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY WE HAVE. SOME VERY DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL MODELS WE ARE A MAP AT MASTERS ENTRY LEVEL PROGRAM. TRANSITIONING TO A DOCTOR ENTRY LEVEL PROGRAM. ATHLETIC TRAINING AS A BACHELORS ENTRY LEVEL PROGRAM WE HAVE DIFFERENT. TRAINING HOURS REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE DIFFERENT PATIENT OUTCOMES. OUR BOARD. LAST YEAR ALMOST DOUBLED OUR FEES ON AL ON OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS BECAUSE HE NEEDED MORE RESOURCES JUST TO HANDLE THE. CASELOAD THAT THEY HAVE ON OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AMOK THE BOARD OF OCCUPATION THERAPY IS CHARGED WITH THE OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION OF AND CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST NOT ATHLETIC TRAINER SO THAT IS A MAJOR CONCERN WEEK WE THINK THAT. JUST BY IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL ITSELF. THE REQUIREMENT OF PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION SEEMS TO US MAKES SENSE THAT IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE ANY OVERSIGHT OVER ATHLETIC TRAINERS. BY THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS IT SHOULD BE THE MEDICAL BOARD. IN REGARDS TO THE THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE. WE THINK THAT IT'S MUCH TOO BROAD. WE THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE DEFINITION REGARDING ATHLETIC TRAINING MORE DEFINITION REGARDING ATHLETIC INJURY. ATHLETIC ACTIVITY PREVENTION RECOGNIZE THE RECOGNITION. RECONDITIONING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE. THE BROAD DEFINITION OF OF ATHLETIC ACTIVITY. IT IT THERE'S NO MENTION OF ANY TYPES OF OF SPORTS OR OR OR ATHLETICS REGARDING ATHLETIC INJURY IN LITERALLY IT IS. YOU COULD BE YOU COULD FALL DOWN THE STAIRS WALKING TO THIS COMMITTEE GET HURT AND YOUR INJURY WOULD FALL UNDER. THE DEFINITION OF ATHLETIC ACTIVITY. THIS BILL IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE AS IT'S WRITTEN NOW. IS TRYING TO FILL A HOLE IN THE DELAY IN THE HAT IN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT EXIST. BASED ON THIS DEFINITION. AND. WE WE THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE REGARDING SCOPE OF PRACTICE. ON ATHLETIC TRAINING AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS JUST WERE SO FAR AWAY FROM WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE WE PREACH IT WE HAVE TWENTY MORE SECONDS THANK YOU. BUT YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO YUP I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY MY NAME'S CHRIS RATE ON CALIFORNIA. I'M THE GOOD REPAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIR OF CONFLICT IS THAT THEIR POSITION I'M OUT HELP A LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND AS OUR PRODUCT LIKE TRAINER. I SPEAK IN OPPOSITION A. B. THIRTY THIRTY ONE TEN. THE REPORTS OF THE BILL ARGUE THAT ATHLETES ARE SAFER ONCE ABOUT THE TRAINERS ON THE SIDELINES. THAT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS POSING AS OTHER TRAINERS OR IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE UNQUALIFIED. WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT HAVING A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL ON THE SIDELINES IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF OUR ATHLETES HOWEVER THE LANGUAGE THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ATHLETES SPORTS. SPORTS TEAMS OR SPORTS VENUES. THE BILL TALK ABOUT LIKE TRAINERS WORKING WITH PATIENTS AND PROVIDING TREATMENT TO THEM. LICENSURE IS NOT ALWAYS THE RIGHT WAY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC ADDRESSING THE NUMBER ONE REASON GIVEN FOR THIS BILL. THAT OF MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT CALL THEMSELVES ATHLETIC TRAINERS UNLESS THEY HAVE APPROPRIATE COULD CREDENTIALS. IS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HAVE NO OPPOSITION. IT ALSO ADDRESSES ANOTHER KEY ARGUMENT THE THE MADE IN SUPPORT A BILL THAT REGULATION IS NECESSARY TO CARRY CALIFORNIA BASED ATHLETIC TRAINERS. CAN TRAVEL TO OTHER STATES. WE ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THE SCOPE. AND WE WE THINK THE BILL'S IS HIGHLY FLOPPED UP THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION UNDER ME TO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME TO THE MIKE AND INFLATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. KATHERINE ROSS HAS GOTTEN A CALIFORNIA CADRE OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS WHO ASSOCIATE OURSELVES TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE HUTUS IN PT'S AND REMAIN UP AND OPPOSED THE BILL. PAT WHALEN ELLIS MILLS NEVER SEE HERE ON BEHALF OF UNITED NURSES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA PROUD MEMBER VAST ME WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED. TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION WE HAVE PROPOSAL AS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. LYNETTE BEATLES OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS IN OPPOSITION. LARA LOPEZ OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST OPPOSITION. CHRIS POWERS PROFESSOR AT USC AND ALSO PRESIDENT AND THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. WE STAND OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. C. NO WITNESSES TO WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU I I MET QUESTION FOR BOTH THAT PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS SO I AM FOR AND. I HAVE HIM MY KIDS ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY PLACE SPORTS I WOULD I WANT THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO A SEMI WHO'S WELL TRAINED WITH GOOD ADVICE TO PROTECT THEM AS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE SPORTS. BUT I AM CURIOUS WHY ME OUR STATE ALSO. REALLY DOES CREATE BARRIERS TO ENTERING THE PROFESSION BUT ALL THE LICENSING THAT REQUIRED USUALLY STARTS WITH A LICENSE AND THEN IT'S FEES AND THEN IT'S. THE BATTLES BETWEEN WHO GETS TO PRACTICE WHAT AND MEANWHILE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO INTO THE FIELD AND CAN'T TO THEY MIGHT BE VERY GOOD AND VERY QUALIFIED. I'M IN THE PAST YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE AS EARLY AS THIS LEGISLATURE'S HEARD BILLS ON TITLE REGULATION HAVING A CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINER BE A TITLE THAT'S REGULATED. WHY NOT THAT STEP BEING THE MORE APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO THIS? IT'S A BALANCE BETWEEN OVER REGULATING ACCESS TO A CAREER AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A QUALIFIED PERSON IN THAT. PARENTS AND CONSUMERS ARE ON NOTICE OF WHO IS CERTIFIED IN APPROPRIATELY GIVEN THAT TITLE AND WHO ISN'T. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE AROUND. TITLE PROTECTIONS AND. THERE IS I'VE OF. QUITE A LONG HISTORY TO THIS EFFORT. ALL AYE NOT OUTRIGHT OPPOSED TO SOME. INTERIM STEP TO GET US TO LICENSING BUT. I THINK THAT IS GONNA BE THE SUBJECT OF SOME DISCUSSION THAT THE REALITY THOUGH IS THERE ARE SOME REALLY FUNDAMENTAL REASONS WHY TITLE PROTECTION IS SIMPLY NOT. NOT SUFFICIENT I DON'T WANT IT DIRECT THAT ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION. IN THE WORKFORCE. I THINK WHAT'S BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO ME IS OF MOST OF THE SITE. ATHLETIC TRAINERS WHO ARE OPERATING I SEE MOST NOT ALL BUT MOST IN CALIFORNIA. ARE ARE A RELATIVELY HIGHLY EDUCATED. AND. THESE FOLKS WANT. TO BE LICENSE THEY ARE THERE THERE'S TO UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED AND FEES IN ANTICIPATION OF. A SETTING UP A LICENSING STRUCTURE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WHAT TO ELEVATE THEIR PROFESSION. I DON'T THINK I WANTTO SEE IS A BARRIER I THINK IT'S FRANKLY ELEVATING OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE ATHLETIC TRAINERS BUT ALSO CREATES THESE PROTECTIONS WHEN THEY. ARE ACROSS A STATE LINES BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS. DEFERRED MIKE PATCHES ARE WHO CAN TALK ABOUT. WHY TITLE PROTECTION IS SIMPLY NOT SUFFICIENT BUT ALSO PERHAPS YOU CAN GIVE YOU JUST A? QUICK SNAPSHOT OF HOW MUCH WE NOW LIAR CALIFORNIA IS IN RELATION TO THE FORTY NINE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE A REAL REGULATORY STRUCTURE WELL ON THE ON THAT LAST POINT IS IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE ANSWER IS IS SOME OBSCENE SAVE TIME IS SOMEWHAT LESS COMPELLING BECAUSE. WE ARE OUT LIAR HOW MUCH WE'D LICENSE PEOPLE AND HOW MUCH WE REQUIRE FOR HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE AND SHE DIDN'T THINK YOU. IN THE WHAT'S SO INSUFFICIENT ABOUT TITLE REGULATION. TITLE. OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION IS ESPECIALLY TO REACH THAT CORRECT BALANCE. WITHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE. BORDER COMMITTEE YOUR BUREAU THERE'S NO WAY AND TO ASSURE. THAT ANYONE IS ACTUALLY COMPLYING. AND WHEN THEY SAY THAT THEY'RE CERTIFIED IS JUST. ATTESTING THAT THEY ARE WHICH DOESN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING IF SOMEONE'S COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATUS AND HE MENTIONED. THAT. THEY'VE LOST HER LICENSE IN THIS. IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL DOES HAPPEN PEOPLE COULD JUST COMMANDED JUST TITLE PROTECTION. THERE'S STILL NO WAY FOR THE STATE TO GUARANTEE THAT THAT PERSON. S. QUALIFIED SO WITH THE LICENSURE SET UP WE HAVE THAT INVESTIGATORY POWER UNDERSTAND AND THERE'S A WAYS TO FIX THAT MINUTES MANY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK. CALIFORNIANS ARE FIND ONE THAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE MATCH FOR DOING THAT BUT. THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS IN JUST YOUR. VERY GOOD WITNESS THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS HAD EXPERIENCE WITH CONCUSSIONS AND YOU MENTION THAT IT WAS I'M SORRY WE TO GET YOUR NAME BUT YOU MENTIONED THAT IT WAS MISMANAGEMENT OF THE ATHLETIC TRAINER. HOW WAS THAT CONCLUSION REACHED THAT IT WAS THAT? THAT CAUSED WHEN I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR HAS BEEN SEEN. DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. YOU RESTATE YOUR QUESTION ARE JUST AND YOU WERE KIND ENOUGH TO MENTION THAT DE EXPERIENCE YOU HAD WAS MISMANAGEMENT FROM THE ATHLETIC TRAINER AND. I'M WONDER IF YOU CAN ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT. WAS WHAT KHA YOU KNOW CONTRIBUTED TO HER WORK HAD YOU HAD A. AS THE LICENSED ATHLETIC TRAINER THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER I'M I JUST ELABORATE A BIT ON YOUR EXPERIENCE IF YOU COULD YEAH SO. FOR WOMEN FROM WHAT I TOLD FROM THEM I PROFESSIONALS. BY DOCTORS. SO THAT EVEN IF I WOULD HAVE GONE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS I SAID. I HAD TO REDUCE THE SWELLING. THEN THAT WOULD. DRAMATICALLY. YEAH. THANK YOU YEAH AND I CAN'T IF I COULD SPEAK UP I'M A REGISTERED NURSE. AS AS WELL AS HIS MOTHER HE WAS HIT IN THE HEAD SO SEVERELY HE COULDN'T SEE HE WAS LAID OUT FLAT ON ITS BACK. AND THE ONLY TREATMENT HE GOT WAS ARE YOU HOPING TO GET UP AND PLAY. THERE WAS. YOU KNOW NO OTHER TREATMENT AFTER HIS SECOND HIT WHEN HE PULLED HIMSELF OUT OFF THE FIELD. THE TRAINER TOLD IN THE SET ON THE BENCH AND HELL BE FINE. A CONCERNED FATHER FROM THE STANDS ACTUALLY WENT DOWN HE WAS UNABLE TO STATE HIS NAME WHERE HE LIVE MY NAME MY PHONE NUMBER. THE FATHER HAD YOU SEE VERY ON HIS PHONE TO CALL ME. AND FIND OUT WHERE WE LIVE TO BRING HIM TO ME. RIGHT TO COME TO THE HOSPITAL HE WAS ADMITTED FOR FIVE DAYS. AND IT WAS THAT SECOND IMPACT ON HIS HEAD. THAT COST HIS PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE UNDERSTAND THANK YOU IT JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE RESPONDING TO THAT TYPE OF. INCIDENT WITH THE RIGHT. SOLUTION AND SO I'M VERY SORRY FOR THAT AND GRATEFUL THAT YOU TRAVELED OUT TO SHARE THAT WITH US IN IF IF IT JUST IT JUST OF THE OPPOSITION MISTER ALL SUMMER. YOU KNOW WHAT I I I'M NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING I KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S NOT A. YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS PART THE OCCUPATIONAL BOARD OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY BOARD BE THE ONE TO OVERSEE BUT WHAT I HEARD IS BECAUSE. FEES MIGHT BE CHARGED MORE BUT PRESUMABLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LICENSE BUT ALSO BE PAYING FEES AND SOMETHING ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S AN ENTRY LEVEL AT BACHELOR VERSUS MASTER A DOCTORATE Y. DOES THAT MAKE THE OCCUPATIONAL BOARD NOT THE RIGHT PLACE. BUT WHAT'S I WAS JUST TRYING TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ATHLETIC TRAINING AND. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY THE THAT THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IS THERE IS IN THE PRACTICE ITSELF AND. THE THE PATIENT OUTCOMES IN THE FIFTH AND THE FIFTH IN THE TRAINING THAT IS REQUIRED. OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS VERSES. ACT VERSES ATHLETIC TRAINING THEY'RE NOT THEY ARE. THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. PROFESSIONS AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. NOT BEING AS FOCUSED AS THEY NEED TO BE AND THE CONCERNS OFF FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF THEIR BEING UPWARD PRESSURE. ON OUR OWN LICENSING FEES TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED WORKLOAD AS WELL ON ATHLETIC TRAINING AND SO IT'S IT'S A TWO FOLD CONCERN. THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS OF. SURE ASSEMBLY WOMAN TRY APPRECIATE QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS. THE LOW BOTTOM CONTENTION HERE YOU KNOW THAT. THERE WAS PRIOR LEGISLATION VERY SIMILAR TO THIS BILL THAT C. BUT NAM. PORT OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SUPPORTED. NOW WE'RE GOING TO THE PROCESS NOW I GUESS. THIS THE ITEM IS IN THEIR LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE BUT I EXPECT THAT C. BOT WILL. COME OUT IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. I BELIEVE THEY WANT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO AT SO I. BOB I JUST WANT TO SUGGEST THAT I REALLY DO BELIEVE AND THERE'S A LONG HISTORY WITH THIS WITH THIS BALLOT LOTS OF RESEARCH I BELIEVE SEE BUT ACTUALLY IS THE APPROPRIATE. I HAS A CAPACITY TO DO THIS OVERSIGHT OF BUT I AM. OPEN TO ANY AND ALL DISCUSSIONS TO GET THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL ITS CITY AND SO ON AFTER MANY MANY YEARS OF ATTEMPTS. WE REMAIN. THIS OUT WIRES JUST. WELL IT'S A APPARENT OF KIDS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN SPORTS THAT THAT ARE OUT RUNNING AROUND IN AND HAVE AN IMPACT IN AND ATHLETES THEMSELVES I'M. GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON IT I HATE WE THINK WE NEED TO NARROWLY TAILOR AS MUCH AS WE CAN I THINK THAT TITLE REGULATION THAT YOU KNOW THIS TYPE OF STEPS TO BE REALLY GOOD TO HAVE AS PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AND. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS SOMEONE BAKER ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS. BIRTH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ALSO I WANT TO APPLAUD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR ADDRESSING WHAT IS THE IT IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AN ISSUE. THAT. THE TESTIMONY THAT. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO STEP UP AND DO SOMETHING IS THAT WERE THE LAST STATE. AND SO. THAT SHOULD BE REASON ENOUGH RIGHT THERE TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE ACTION. ABSOLUTE BEST. OR WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO TO MOVE FORWARD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS OUT AGAIN. AND I DO LIKE YOUR REFERENCE TO GETTING IT INTO THE END ZONE. HOPEFULLY YOUR ATHLETIC TRAINER CAN GET YOU THERE. I THINK OPPOSITION. I HAVE MISTER REED. I YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE A THERAPIST AND THAT YOU ALSO ARE AN ATHLETIC TRAINER. SO IN A NOT SURE WHAT CAPACITIES ON BOTH SIDES YOU KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT YOU WORK. IN YOUR PROFESSION BUT. HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHERE YOU WERE AN ATHLETIC TRAINER. AND YOU WERE CALLED UPON AND THE PERSON YOU WERE WORKING WITH. YOU WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED A PATIENT. ARE. DOES IT BECOME A BIT SEMANTIC GOAL OR. THAT I MEAN WE JUST GOT DONE HEARING A BILL ABOUT. PETS BEING CALLED PATIENTS. SO ARE NOT CALLING PEOPLE THAT ARE INJURED OR. WHATEVER PETS BUT. MUSIC CANNOT BE A PATIENT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AN ATHLETIC TRAINER WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE LARGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS ATHLETES WHEN THEY'RE PARTICIPATING IN ORGANIZED FOR. THEY'VE GOT THEIR PRE PARTICIPATION SCREENINGS THAT HAVE CLEARED THEM OF YEAH I UNDERLINED ICAL CONDITIONS SO WHEN THE ATHLETE DOES GO DOWN THE FIELD. YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOMEBODY WHO PRIOR TO GOING DOWN WAS A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY UNDERLYING ACTIONS OR IF THEY DID HAVE AN UNDERLYING CONDITION YOU'RE AWARE OF WHAT THE CONDITION WAS. WHAT I'M A PHYSICAL THERAPIST PRICING IN THE CLINIC AND A PATIENT WALKS AND? WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SEEN A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL PREVIOUSLY FOR THAT CONDITION? I GOT A BILL THAT DETERMINE ARE THERE THINGS THAT UNDERLYING THAT COULD BE AFFECTING WHAT'S WHAT THE PRESENTATION IS. AND THEN MAKE DETERMINATIONS ON IS APPROPRIATE FOR ME BILL TO TREAT THAT PERSON IS IT MORE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO REFER THAT PATIENT ONTO ANOTHER. AND MEDICAL PROVIDER AT THAT POINT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMAN EGGMAN. THANK YOU UP WHEN YOU SING UP PERSONS FOUND TO BE LOCATED ON THE FIELD YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU THE DOCTOR THEY JUST CHECK THAT BOX IT'S A. YEAH GOOD SHAPE. MY EXEMPTS THE MAJORITY IN PEOPLE HAVE TO GO FOR LIKE A PRE SCORED SKEPTICISM AND UP TO GO TO THE SPORT YOU HAVE TO GO BY AND IT'S I MEAN. IT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. YEAH I'M REFERRING TO THE PARTICIPATION SCREENINGS ARE DONE YA SOMETIMES THE PHYSICIAN DOES JUST CHECK THE BOX AND SAYS YEAH THAT'S ALRIGHT. BUT IF THE PHYSICIANS DOING THEIR JOB APPROPRIATELY THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALK WITH PAGE OF FINDING OUT DO THEY HAVE ANY MUSCLES GOT CONCERNS THERE LOOK AT THEIR LAB WORK. THEY'RE LOOKING AT PRIOR IT THINGS THAT COME UP. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PATIENT. TRULY IS. APPROPRIATELY PARTICIPATE IN ATHLETICS. OKAY I MEAN I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD. CHINA'S FORMS HAD THOSE FORMS TURNED IN AND ANNA AND I THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM A VARIETY OF OF WAYS IT DOES A COMPLETED. BOMB. TO COME TO STATE YOUR PREMISE ON THAT. I. AM I GUESS MY QUESTION IS AROUND JUST AND JUST LOOKING AT THE QUALIFICATIONS AND WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING. ARE THE MAJORITY OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE PRACTICING OR THE CERTIFIED UNDER THE NATIONAL CERTIFICATION BECAUSE THERE'S A NATIONAL CERTIFICATION THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO BE. SORT OF ITEMS I CORRECT AND SO DO WE KNOW DO WE HAVE REQUIREMENTS THAT EVERYBODY. PRACTICING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS PORTRAIT NATIONAL CERTIFIES. YES A GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TO MIKE'S ARE EVEN GIVE YOU THE PRECISE. RUN DOWN ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND THEIR NATIONAL CERTIFICATION. SO. THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT AND THAT'S WHAT PART OF WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS. I AM IN ALL HONESTY THE MAJORITY OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS. OUR CERTIFIED VETERAN PUEDEN WORKINGS AFFECT TRAINERS. AND BUT AS DR CHIANG MENTION THROUGH CI HAVE SURVEYS WE KNOW THAT OVER. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OVER TWENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE CALLING THEMSELVES AN ETHIC TRAINER IN A HIGH SCHOOL DO NOT HAVE THE PROPER QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING. SOMETIMES THAT IS KNOWING AND THE SCHOOL. YES WE HAVE SOME BE CERTIFIED WHO ACTUALLY ISN'T. IN DO WE HAVE WE HAVE DIFFERENCES IN IN TREATMENT OUTCOMES FROM THOSE WHO ARE CERTIFIED NOT CERTIFIED WE'VE WILL HAVE TO STE. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CERTIFIED WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO EVEN BEGIN DOING THAT SO THERE REALLY ISN'T A WAY TO COMPARE THOSE APPLES AND ORANGES. AND SILVA SMOG AGAIN ON THIS IDEA OF GOING TO A FULL LICENSURE. IT MEANS YOU'RE INTERVENING STEP WHEREYOU COULD EVERYBODY IT WOULD HAVE TO BE GRANTED TO BE CERTIFIED. WHO'S PRACTICING THAT. CERTAINLY OPEN TO HAVING THAT DISCUSSION I WANT US TO GET TO FULL LICENSURE I'D LOVE TO DO IT WITH THIS BILL. THIS YEAR POSSIBLY CAN MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT IT AND AND FINALLY GET IT DONE. BUT LOOK I. AND. TALKING WITH ALL OF THE OPPOSITION ON THIS THING I THINK THEY'RE A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE CAN MOST CERTAINLY TAKE CARE OF I THINK THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL SCOPE ISSUES WITH. OF FISCAL AS THERE PESTS. IN THE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE REALLY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH. SO WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING THROUGH ALL OF THOSE ISSUES. THIS WEEK BUT. I JUST THINK IF WE. LEAVE THIS ISSUE YET ANOTHER YEAR. AND DON'T MOVE FORWARD. A CHEST UP POINTS TO THE FACT THAT. CALIFORNIA'S INCAPABLE OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AND I DON'T ACCEPT THAT. WE HAVE TO FIX THIS CAN AND. AND THEN THESE ATHLETIC TRAINERS WOULD BE PASSED SUPERVISED BY WHOM THE LICENSED ATHLETIC TRAINERS ANY SUPERVISION. WHICH MIKE WOULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT THAT. OVERSIGHT P. SO AUTHOR TRAINERS ARE REQUIRED SO PEOPLE ARE CERTIFIED FOR THE MOST PART AND SOON IN CALIFORNIA ARE WORKING UNDER THE DIRECTION OF PHYSICIAN. CERTAINLY RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO MANDATE FOR THAT. AND THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT AND AGAIN ALL THESE MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN SUPPORT. OF THAT AND SAYING THAT THAT TIE IS ACCEPTABLE WE'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS THIS WEEK AND PROPOSE THOSE TO SOME GROUPS. TO DO THAT AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW FOR LOOKING AT. NO THE OUTCOMES I MEAN I THINK. A STORY THAT YOU HEARD TODAY THAT'S THE TYPE OF THE OUTCOME THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT AND THAT DOES. OCCUR WITH THESE UNQUALIFIED PEOPLE MANAGING THESE COMPLEX ISSUES. AND THEN THAT WOULD I MEAN UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A PHYSICIAN AND WOOD ADDRESS YOUR ISSUE ABOUT IF YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPIST COMING TO KNOW THAT OPPOSITION HAS BASICALLY OKAYED THAT PERSON FOR. YEAH LET ME SPEAK TO THE OVERSIGHT ISSUE JUST A LITTLE BIT HERE. SO AB THIRTY ONE TEN AUTHORIZES AN ATHLETIC TRAINER DO TREAT THEIR. PATIENTS. UNDER THE PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION THE SUPERVISION REQUIRED CAN BE AS LITTLE AS A. A CATHOLIC TRAINING PROTOCOL THERE'S BEEN DEVELOP BETWEEN THE ATHLETIC TREND THE POSITION THAT SAYS YEAH IF YOU HAVE AN ANKLE SPRAIN. IF YOU'RE PENSION PLANS WITH DESIGNS AND AS AN ANKLE SPRAIN TREAT THIS PATIENT APPROPRIATELY FOR AS LONG AS YOU FEEL THAT YOUR COUPLED TREAT FOR. RIGHT AS A PHYSICAL THERAPIST I CAN ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND I HAVE SOME DOUBT IT BECAUSE THAT THAT'S HOW WE DO EVERYTHING YOU NURSES EVERYTHING EVERYBODY ELSE THERE ARE PROTOCOLS ESTABLISH WHICH IS NOW SUPERVISION OCCURS SO. IT BY PROCEDURE. ALRIGHT THINKING SMALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DOCTOR AND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. YOU KNOW I WANTED TO IF IF I COULD CONTINUE TO PROBE ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON'S QUESTION I THOUGHT IT WAS. A VERY GOOD ONE AND WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD HEAR FROM DOCTORS CHIANG WHO SPOKE EARLIER TODAY. AND HAVE HER ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE. BUT BEFORE WHILE SHE'S COMING UP I WANTED TO THANK THE INFORMATIONAL NATURE OF THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS A BODY TO. HEAR AND DELIBERATE WITH YOU AND TO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER MULLIN JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN THIS MANNER TODAY. THIS RED BUTTON GETS ME EVERY TIME. PERTAINING TO THE USE OF ATHLETE OR PATIENT SO I JUST CHAIRED A. INNER SOCIAL ASIAN DOCUMENT OF MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF MEDICATIONS IN THE SPORTS MEDICINE SETTING. WE ALL AGREE THAT WE USE THE TERM PATIENT AND NOT ATHLETE. AND THE FACT IS IS THAT. A. YOU KNOW EVERY EVERY UP PATIENT EVERY ATHLETE IS A PATIENT EVERY PATIENTS THE ATHLETE WE WE. LOOK AT THAT WHOLE SCOPE OF PRACTICE AS SOMEONE WHO COMES WAS FOR CARE AS A PATIENT. IN TERMS OF THE THE IDEA THAT EVERY PATIENT. BUT THE ATHLETIC TRAINER SIS HAS A PRE PARTICIPATION FISCAL CLEARANCES NOT TRUE. ATHLETIC TRAINERS WORK IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS WHERE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT PATIENT. THEY DON'T KNOW. IF THAT PATIENTS HAD A A PRE PARTICIPATION PHYSICALS CETERA. AND THE THING IS IS THAT THEY HAVE THE EDUCATION AND THE TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO. MANAGE. THAT. SITUATION APPROPRIATELY AND AVOID A POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC SITUATION IN THE CASE OF BUSY. THERE WAS A. PRESUMED ATHLETIC TRAINER WHO DID NOT HAVE THAT NECESSARY EDUCATION LICENSURE. OF COURSE NOT LICENSE OR BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT EDUCATION. AND CERTIFICATION AND THEREFORE DIDN'T KNOW. HOW TO MANAGE HIS HEAD INJURY? WHICH LED TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH HIM. I WILL SAY THAT. THE PHYSICAL THERAPY. THAT IN THE REAL WORLD. IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN PRACTICING IN THE REAL WORLD. WE ALL WORK AS A TEAM. PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ATHLETIC TRAINERS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS PHYSICIANS. WE ARE A TEAM WHETHER NOT WORKING WITH A HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE. PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE IN LIBYAN. OR SOMEONE WHO IS PLAYING TENNIS. AND GETS INJURED. WE WORK AS A TEAM AND I HAVE LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM MY FISKE THERAPISTS WHO SUPPORT THIS LICENSURE. AND THERE'S NO POLITICS INVOLVED IT IS A HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR PATIENTS. AND THAT'S WHY WE WORK AND TO. DO THE WORK THAT WE DEAL. AND THIS IS WHY I'M COMING FROM OHIO. IF I CAME TO CALIFORNIA. TO SEEK A MEDICAL LICENSE TO PRACTICE AND OHIO I DID% SOMETHING UNETHICAL IT WOULD BEEN REPORTED. IF I WOULD HAVE COME TO CALIFORNIA. AND ASK FOR LICENSE THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE LOOKED. AT OHIO TO SAY HEY. THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON WITH HER WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE HER LICENSE I COULDN'T PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULDN'T HARM ANY MORE PATIENTS. THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT AFFECT TRAINERS WHO HAVE DONE SOMETHING A TRANSGRESSION IN THEIR STATE CAN COME TO CALIFORNIA. AND PRACTICE AND THERE'S NO LICENSING AUTHORITIES SAY. HEY THIS PERSON IS UNSAFE. THEY SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN CARE OF PATIENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WHETHER WE CALL THEM. PATIENTS OR WITNESSES OR IS THE. HOW IMPORTANT HIS STORY WAS TO ALL OF US HERE TODAY AND I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO MOMENTS TO GO BY WITHOUT YOU KNOWING HOW MOVING YOUR TESTIMONY? SO THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY.

BUSINESS COMMERCIALLY WAS SOMEBODY IN THE ADULT FIELD AND VICE VERSA WHAT THIS MEANS NOW IS THAT WHEN THE PLANT IS THIS BIG AT THE CULTIVATOR IT MUST BE DESIGNATED AS AN ADULT USE OR MET MEDICAL USE PLANT. AND NEVER SHALL IT CHANGED FROM THAT POINT UNTIL IT IS SOLD TO A CONSUMER EITHER AS A PLANT OR AS AAS A. MANUFACTURE PRODUCT AT THE END OF THE LINE AND THAT MAKES IT OPERATIONALLY INCREDIBLY CHALLENGE. FOR OUR BUSINESSES TO OPERATE ON BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MARKET IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE DOWN THE PATH. I'M WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE NIMBLE ENOUGH TO MOVE THE PRODUCT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER WE DO OTHER TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM DOESN'T CHANGE THAT WE WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT PRODUCT CAME FROM AND WHERE IT'S GOING. AT EVERY POINT BUT UNDER THIS BILL. IT WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE ACROSS THE FIREWALL ON BETWEEN A MAN AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND STRONG SUPPORT THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITIES THIS YEAR TO ADDRESS ME WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR. IN ADDITION TO WHAT. MISTER ROUNDS MARTIN HAD TO SAY. WE WHICH IS ECHO THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD. REDUCE THE SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON INDUSTRY AND THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER THIS PARTICULAR MODEL AYE TO IMPLEMENT TWO SEPARATE PATHS. ONE FOR MEDICINAL ONE FOR ADULT USE AND THAT'S EXTREMELY KATA COSTLY AND ADDS DUPLICATING OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS. IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE GIVEN WE DO HAVE LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO DO AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES I WOULD ALSO NOTE TOO THAT. THIS ENSURES ACCESS BY ALLOWING THE CROSSOVER BETWEEN A AND M. IN JURISDICTIONS THAT ALLOW WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL HAVE MEDICINAL PRODUCTS OBVIOUSLY THE ADULT USE MARKET IS. A IT IS ASSUMED WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LUCRATIVE AND WE WANT TO ENSURE MEDICAL PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE TO LEGITIMATE PATIENTS AND PROTECTED LASTLY I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE WAY AND A TYPE CANNABIS PLANT IS GROWN AND AN M. TYPE THE SAME APPLIES TO THE WAY I CANNABIS IS MANUFACTURED THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO DISTINCTION OR.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO PLEASE% FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY YES THANK YOU I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AND AMENDMENTS IN COMMITTEE TO ADD AND URGENCY CLASS TO THE BILL. AS YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STARTED ISSUING LICENSES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. SEVERAL CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING ADVERTISEMENTS. NOT POSTING THE PROPER STATE LICENSURE FOR INDIVIDUALS MAYBE TWENTY EIGHT NINETY NINE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY CLARIFYING THAT ALL ADVERTISEMENTS FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES. BOTH OUT DURING ONLINE MUST INCLUDE THAT CALIFORNIA'S THE LICENSE NUMBER ON THE ADVERTISE. THIS IS A LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW THAT NEEDS CLARITY AND UNFORTUNATELY HAS CREATED A SCENARIO WHERE. ADVERTISEMENT PLATFORMS ARE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY CAN ADVERTISE FOR UNLICENSED BUSINESSES. I LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S SPECIFY IT SPECIFICALLY IN SAN DIEGO IN SACRAMENTO HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS WITH THESE ILLEGAL ADVERTISEMENTS IN FEBRUARY. OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS HEALTH AND. INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON CANNABIS REGULATION AN UPDATE ON STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS HEARING LEGISLATORS CITED SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF CANNABIS ADVERTISE ADVERTISING. WHERE LICENSE NUMBERS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DISPLAYED THE LEGISLATION IS A SMALL STEP THIS LEGISLATION OF THE SMALL STEP FORWARD MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THE LICENSE NUMBER ON ADVERTISEMENTS IT IS THE LICENSE ISSUED BY THE STATE? WITH THAT I A I HAVE YOUR LINOCUTS CODE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE UNITED CANNABIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. ON SABRINA CENTRIC FANDRICH WITH THE BERKELEY PATIENTS GROUP. AND WITH THAT. AND THAT OVER TO YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN UP TO THREE MINUTES OF OUR WITNESSES COMMISSION IS PICKING SUPPORT PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. WAS IT. MARTIN AND I WHAT THE HECK CAN HAS BEEN THIS ASSOCIATION WITH THEIR CLIENT. PAT YOU SEE BE YOUR ANTI. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE SUCCESS OF THE CALIFORNIA REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. IS THE ABILITY TO ELIMINATE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. AS YOU KNOW MOST CONSUMERS USE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS FOR EVERYDAY NEEDS AND. SEARCHING FOR A WHILE CANNABIS WAS IS ONE OF SUCH NEAT SO. TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS ONLY ARE UTILIZING LEGAL CAMPUS. OF BUSINESSES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE ONLY ADVERTISING OUT LEGAL CAMPUS BUSINESSES THIS WILL ALSO. PROTECT THE CONSUMERS FROM. NOT UTILIZING OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT TESTING THEIR PRODUCTS AND A BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT PAYING THEIR TAXES. ENSURING THAT THE BUSINESSES AND DISPLAY OF THE STATE ISSUED LICENSE NUMBER. WILL NOT ONLY. CURB A LEGAL ACTIVITY BUT ALSO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS. HI MY NAME IS SABRINA FANDRICH. DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR BERKELEY PATIENTS GROUP OF PPG IS THE OLDEST CONTINUOUSLY OPERATING DISPENSARY THE COUNTRY AND WAS ONE OF THE FIRST DISPENSARIES TO GET AN ADULT USE TEMPORARY LICENSE IN THE STATE. NEW YEAR'S DAY MARKED A PIVOTAL MILESTONE FOR US AND THAT STATES ENTIRE INDUSTRY EXPECTATIONS WERE REALLY HIGH. MANY OBSERVERS WERE CONFIDENT THAT ADULT YOU SALES WOULD BE A BOON FOR LOCAL ECONOMIES AND ULTIMATELY WEED OUT THE ILLICIT MARKET HOWEVER FRUSTRATION QUICKLY OVERTAKE EXCITEMENT HIGH TAX RATES THE FINANCIAL COST OF COMPLIANCE. INACTION BY MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNLIMITED ENFORCEMENT GAVE WAY TO THE EVER PRESENT AND NEWLY EMPOWERED UNREGULATED MARKET. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE GOAL OF A REGULATED MARKET IS TO BRING IN AS MANY OPERATORS AND A COMPLIANCE AS POSSIBLE ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PATRON LEGAL DISPENSARIES WITH QUALITY LAB TESTED CANNABIS PRODUCTS. AND WE DON'T THE WAS IT MARKET HOWEVER MANY FACTORS HAVE EMERGED THAT ARE INHIBITING THE SUCCESS OF OUR KNEES AND INDUSTRY. AB TWENTY NINETY NINE ADDRESSES ONE OF THESE FACTORS AS IT RELATES TO TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS OR MORE SPECIFICALLY ONLINE CANNABIS DIRECTORIES. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CONSUMER FACING INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR MARKETING STRATEGY WE LIVE IN A DIGITAL WORLD IN THE ABILITY TO REACH OUR CONSUMER BASE RELIES HEAVILY ON THE EXTENDED REACH PROVIDED BY OUR ONLINE PRESENCE. HOWEVER ADVERTISING UNLICENSED OPERATORS ALONGSIDE LICENSE OPERATORS WITH NO WAY FOR A CONSUMER TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO NOT ONLY UNDERMINES THE NEW LEGAL MARKET BUT ALSO POSES A. PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT. THIS IS BECAUSE ONLY LICENSE DISPENSARIES ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE PAY TAXES AND SELL LAB TESTED PRODUCTS. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY EXTENDS FURTHER THAN SIMPLE ONLINE A DIRECTORIES MANY OF THESE CANNABIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE ENGAGING IN COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY. IN SOME CASES THERE IS NO WAY TO EVEN KNOW WHAT DISPENSED WITH THE PRODUCTS COMING FROM WHEN ONE ORDERS ONLINE. HAVE ONE SUCH EXAMPLE IS THERE A DELIVERY PLATFORM EASE THIS BUSINESSES ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATING WHOLESALE PURCHASES RECEIVING ORDERS VERIFYING ELIGIBILITY RECOUP RECRUITING DRIVERS AND ESSENTIALLY COORDINATING THE SUPPLY CHAIN THERE'S NOT A SINGLE LICENSE NUMBER TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE ON THE WEBSITE. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES WHO IS LIABLE FOR THESE VIOLATIONS IT THE CANNABIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS EXAMS AND THE LICENSEE IS ANONYMOUS THAT PUTS THE CONSUMER AT RISK. WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PROBLEM THROUGH TWENTIETH CENTURY LANDS ONLINE COMMERCE IS A STANDARD BUSINESS MODEL IN TODAY'S WORLD AND THERE NEEDS TO BE OVERSIGHT TRANSPARENCY IN A CLEAR DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN. ONLINE CANNABIS DIRECTORIES AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS WHOSE APPLICATIONS EXTEND BEYOND A PURELY INFORMATIONAL FUNCTION AND INTO MY MARSHALL CANNABIS ACTIVITY. THEY THEY VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT NAME AND AFFILIATION FOR THE RECORD IF YOU WISH TO USE.

WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE EIGHTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. BUT THEN THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY BY SUMMER GIPSON. PLEASE TREAT FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHATEVER RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE EIGHTY. WHICH SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT TO CANNABIS LICENSE CAN SHARE COMMON SPACE. FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING A AT LEAST SPACE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO QUALIFY UNDER THE LOS ANGELES ON CD SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM THE LOS ANGELES UM'S SOCIAL EQUITY POP PROGRAM WAS ADOPTED TO ADDRESS THE NEGATIVE IMPACT. ON INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES THAT WERE DISSOLUTE WAS WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS. AS WELL AS CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR EQUITABLE ACCESS TO LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRIES AND TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNERSHIP. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS REGULATES A DEFINITION OF PROMISES PERMISSIVE. IN THE WAY THAT ALLOWS ONLY ONE LICENSE. PER BUSINESS FLOOR PLAN. THIS NEED TO BE CLARIFIED AS IT CREATES A PROBLEM FOR SOCIAL EQUITY LICENSING. OF WHO MAY NEED TO USE THE SAME ENTRANCE EXIT BATHROOMS OR HALLWAY AS A GENERAL LICENSE. THEY SHARE IN THE SAME SPACE. THIS BILL WILL SEEK TO REVISE THE DEFINITION TO ALLOW TO LICENSE TO OCCUPY THE SAME BUILDING OR AREA. AS WELL AS CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF STRUCTURE TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF AVAILABLE LOCATIONS AND REDUCE OVERHEAD COSTS FOR SMALL CANNABIS BUSINESSES BUSINESSES. THIS CHANGE IS NEEDED SO IT IS IN ORDER TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES BUT THOSE WHO WERE ONCE TARGETED. CRIMINALS. FOR WHAT IS NOW A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES ARE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNITED CANNABIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION WHO WAS SELF INTRODUCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTALITY FIRM WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF. OUR MARIN BEEN WITH THE NECK HAS BEEN ASSOCIATION JUST TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU KNOW WE PRIVATE TESTIMONY HERE. I WORK. SO AB TO NINETY EIGHT TWENTY NINE EIGHTY CLARIFIES A DEFINITION OF PROMISES US OF THE TO LICENSE SEES CAN OCCUPY THE SAME BUILDING AND SHARE COMMON USE AREAS. NOW TO BE CLEAR IT'S ONLY A CLARIFICATION OF THAT PROMISES DEFINITION AND IT'S STILL PROHIBITS THAT ANY LICENSE ACTIVITIES ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE. AND AN EIGHTIES COMMON USE AREAS AND REQUIRE THAT ANY LICENSE ACTIVITY IS SEPARATED IN A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT AREA OF THE PROMISES. SO THE BILL SIMPLY. OUT ASKS THAT COMMON SPACES ARE SHARED BY TWO LICENSEES AND ONE BUILDING. UM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ENACTED A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND PART OF THAT REGULARLY FRAMEWORK IS A SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM. THAT IS COMPRISED OF A THREE TIER SYSTEM UP HERE WANTED TO. HAS CRITERIA FOR SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS THAT INCLUDES BEING A LOW INCOME RESIDING AT LEAST FIVE YEARS IN A DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED AREA. AND. AS WELL HAVING PARK CANNABIS CONVICTION TIER THREE APPLICANTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM BY PROVIDING TEN PERCENT OF THEIR APPROACH OF THEIR LEASED SPACE. TIER ONE AND TIER TWO SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS BUT THIS WOULD REQUIRE TO LICENSE HOLDERS TO OCCUPY ONE BUILDING NOW EACH LICENSE HOLDER WOULD STILL HAVE A SEPARATE. DESIGNATED PROMISES AND A STEP SEPARATE AREA WITHIN THAT BUILDING BUT WOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE COMMON SPACES SUCH AS HALLWAYS BATHROOMS THIS WOULD OF COURSE REDUCE THE COST UP FOR SOCIAL EQUITY LICENSE HOLDERS. ARM IN BEING ABLE TO. THEY FIND A COMPLIANT LOCATION IN THE CITY OF LOS SANDERS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY. AVAILABLE LOCATIONS GIVEN THE USE OF A SENSITIVE USE AND ZONING RESTRICTIONS AND ON THE CITY AND STATE LEVEL. OF THIS THIS WOULD ALLOW SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS TO. UTILIZE THESE ALREADY COMPLIANT AND AVAILABLE LOCATIONS. AND ALSO REDUCE THE COST FOR SUCH RECORD APPLICANTS TO ENTER INTO THE CANNABIS BUSINESS. NOTABLY THAT CALIFORNIA PARTNER PUBLIC HEALTH HAS ALREADY ISSUED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR SHARED. SPACE LICENSES IT'S AN* LICENSE AND ALLOWS A. CANNABIS MANUFACTURER LICENSEES TO OCCUPY A THE SAME SPACE AND SHARE QUIT MEANT. AND IN FACT SHARE THE SAME PROMISE THIS BILL DOESN'T ASK UP BOOK THAT BOTH LICENSE HOLDER SCARED THE SAME PREMISE JUST THAT TO LICENSE HOLDERS CAN OCCUPY THE SAME. BUILDING AND SHARE THE COMMON AREAS WITHIN THAT BUILDING. THIS IS VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT FILLED SO FREEDOM PROVIDE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO. WELL HELLO TO LOOK AT HER WE HAVE THE CITY OF OAKLAND STRONG SUPPORT I THINK WERE THE FIRST CITY DOING A EQUITY ORDINANCE WE THINK THE. AUTHOR FOR ALL OF HIS WORK.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RAN MARTIN ON THE HEALTH OF CMG CLEAVER PURSE OFF WE THINK THE GOAL OF SOCIAL EQUITY IS A LAUDABLE GOAL. HUMBLE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS GETTING TO THAT GOAL I'M AND PUTTING AT RISK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE. COLLECTIVELY LEGISLATURE IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE SOUGHT TO DO TO TRY AND KEEP THIS THE SYSTEM IS TRANSPARENT AND PRISTINE AS POSSIBLE TO DELIVER TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THAT. PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ON THE INTEGRITY OF I'M ARE CONCERNED HAS LONG BEEN IN THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE WE COME OUT OF THE CITY. WHERE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS? EDUCATED US VERY WELL ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT OUR PROMISES. SAN JOSE POLICE DEPARTMENT INSISTS ON MAKING SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE SQUARE INCH EXCEPT THE RESTROOMS ARE COVERED. AND AND PROTECTED AGAINST ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AS THEY SAY DIVERSION AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE NOT JUST IN THE PLACES WHERE THE ACTIVITY AND WHETHER LICENSE ACTIVITY IS ACTUALLY OCCURRING. I'M WE'RE CONCERNED THAT ONCE YOU CREATE A NEW ON CERTAIN ELEMENT BY LIKE ADDING A SELF A SECOND. OR MORE. LICENSEE TO A SPACE YOU ARE CREATING UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER THAT SPACE CAN BE PROTECTED AGAINST ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GET AT THE SOCIAL EQUITY GOALS WITHOUT PUTTING AT RISK OF THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE PROMISES AND WE ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SEE NO WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS.

THE PRESENT. AB THIRTY SIXTY ONE ACCORDING TO A REPORT RECENTLY RELEASED BY OTHER PLAYERS PROJECT. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO OVER THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S ILLICIT MASSAGE BUSINESSES AND CONTAINS TWO OF THE THREE MAIN CITIES IN THE COUNTRY TO WHICH VICTIMS ARE RECRUITED. TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING RINGS OPERATING AS MASSAGE THERAPY BUSINESSES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED A VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL ORDINANCES ACROSS THE STATE. RANGING FROM REGULATING MASSAGE BUSINESSES AS SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES TO DOING NOTHING AT ALL AS IN DESPITE THE STATE'S VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR MASSAGE PRACTITIONERS THIS FRACTURED APPROACH TO REGULATING THE MASSAGE THERAPY INDUSTRY HAS FAILED TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE PUBLIC SAFETY. AB THIRTY SIXTY ONE WILL ACQUIRE A MASSAGE THERAPY ESTABLISHMENT TO REGISTER WITH ITS COUNTY AS A CONDITION OF OPERATION IN ORDER TO BETTER COORDINATE. I'D FORCED EFFORTS BY STATE COUNTIES AND CITIES. A THROUGH A FIRST OF ITS KIND REGISTRY FOR MASSAGE THERAPY ESTABLISHMENTS THIS BILL WILL DO TWO THINGS ONE REDUCE THE STIGMA FOR LEGITIMATE BUSINESS MASSAGE BUSINESSES. MANY OF WHICH OPERATED BY ARE OPERATED BY VULNERABLE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. TO PROHIBIT UNLAWFUL ESTABLISHMENTS FROM THE LOOTING THE ORDINANCES OF ONE OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN FAVOR OF A NEIGHBORING JURISDICTION. I COMMITTED TO ENSURING THIS REGISTRY S. ESTABLISHED UNDER THIS BILL WILL COMPLEMENT EXISTING EFFORTS THAT SOME COUNTIES MAY HAVE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING WITH ME THIS MORNING IS TONY SEE A CUT US.

GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I ALSO VERY MUCH THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD MY NAME IS BERNADETTE MURRAY. I AM A CALIFORNIA MASSAGE THERAPY COUNCIL CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST NUMBER TWO TWO TWO I'VE ALSO BEEN PRACTICING IN WOODLAND CALIFORNIA AS A SOLE PROPRIETOR. FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. I HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND ALSO. WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. OFFICE ABOUT CONCERNS THAT I HAD ABOUT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. PRIMARILY THERE ARE THREE MAIN ASPECTS OF THE BILL. THAT I THINK NEED TO BE AMENDED. THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE BILL HAS TO DO WITH THE. THE WAY IT BECAUSE THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN ON CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE MASSAGE THERAPY ACT AND HOW. THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE TYPES OF SOLE PROPRIETORS THERE IS A CERTIFIED MASSAGE PRACTITIONER THERE'S A CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST IN THEN THERE ARE ALSO NON CERTIFIED. MASSAGE PROVIDERS UNFORTUNATELY WHAT'S IT THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IN THE PROPOSED BILL IS IS CURRENTLY CRAFTED. IT ONLY ADDRESSES CERTIFIED MASSAGE. PRACTITIONERS AND IT INADVERTENTLY DOES NOT ADDRESS CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST OR NON CERTIFIED MASSAGE PROVIDERS SO THE WAY THAT THE BILL IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW. I WOULD NOT BE A MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENT OWNER AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER NOR WOULD MY COLLEAGUE. HUGE THAT SAY FOR EXAMPLE JEANNIE VON WHO LIVES IN YOLO COUNTY SHE'LL IS NOT CERTIFIED AND SHE IS THE SOLE PROVIDER AND SHE WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER UNDER THIS BILL. SO IT DOESN'T CAPTURE THE FULL MARKET. AS MOOD ALSO I'M AN WOODLAND WE ALREADY HAVE. REAL VOCAL PULL BUSINESS REGISTRATIONS FOR ALL BUSINESSES IN WOODLAND NOT JUST MASSAGE BUSINESSES. AND IN THAT REVOKE WILL REGISTRATION ORDINANCE YEAH I AM WHAT IT HAS. PROVISIONS FOR. DENYING REGISTRATIONS IT ALSO HAS PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FOR APPEALS A PROPOSED RICK REPLICATIONS OF REGISTRATIONS AND BURIED CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO DUE PROCESS PROVISION EXPLICITLY LAID OUT IN THIS BILL RIGHT NOW. I THINK THAT'S A MAJOR COMPONENT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THIRTY SECONDS LEFT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES TO ALSO. IT SPEAK AS WELL SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THIRTY SECONDS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME INVESTED IN THIS DISCUSSION. MY NAME IS LAUREN MCLAUCHLAN I'M CALIFORNIA CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST NUMBER TWO SEVEN ONE EIGHT SEVEN I ALSO AM A ROSEVILLE MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENT. PERMIT HOLDER. I AM OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. HELLO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK I AM BJ PETS CMT NUMBER FIVE FIVE TWO. AND IS THIS BILLS WRITTEN TODAY I OPPOSE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SENIOR AUDITION WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN. WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL THIS WAS A HUGE ISSUE THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE MASSAGE PARLORS AND JUST LAST WEEK WE HAD A BIG BUST IN CAMERINO OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING VERY INVOLVED WITH. TWO YEARS WHEN THE ISSUE FOR CAME UP ARE YOU I DON'T SEE THEM LISTED ARE YOU WORKING WITH THE CITY'S AT ALL ON THIS BILL. WEEK WE MUST BECAUSE OF THE COMMITMENT THAT I HAVE TO TRY AND MAKE THIS BILL OUT COMPLIMENTS ME EXIST IN CITIES LIKE THE ONES YOU MENTIONED ACTUALLY TRYING. I THINK ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS SIMPLY PART TIME AND SO. YOU GET A SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES. AND IT HAD I'M A FOR OF ALMOST ALL CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS THIS IS THIS IS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS WE GET FROM OUR RESIDENTS. THEY ARE PART. COMMITMENT. SHARE THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE CITY COUNCIL AS WELL AS OUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS SOMEONE AND THAT'S ALSO CITIES CERTAIN THE CITY COUNCIL. IN THESE CAN BE A REAL PROBLEM AND I A AND ALSO SOMEBODY WHO'S WHO. ENJOYS MASSAGING AS NOT NOT A LOT I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OF WHAT PEOPLE OFFER. I'M SUPPORTING AT TO DAVID IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU STILL NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO EXPAND THAT UMBRELLA TO MAKE SURE WELL ARE LEFT OUT. A AND AGAIN I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE WORKING AND A CITY COUNTY CLERKS HERE IN SUPPORT EITHER OR. DID INTO IT COUNTY ORGANIZATION OR THE LEAGUE CITIES SEEMS LIKE ALL THOSE FOLKS WHO WHO WOULD BE AT THE TABLE TO HELP CRAFT THIS IN THE WAY THAT. I THINK WOULD WOULD FURTHER ACHIEVE YOUR AIMS. THAT'S OUR KITCHEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME SIMILAR GOING IT DO WHICH DECLARE. YES MISTER LARGEST WOULD SAY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY GLOBALLY THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEE IF ANY ADDITIONAL AUTHORS ARE PRESENT. A SUMMER KILEY THIS IS A FILE ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN WHICH IS A ASSEMBLY WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL. TWENTY FOUR ZERO NINE. AND AGAIN WE'LL ALLOW UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND AFTER THREE WITNESSES AYE THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. WELCOME AT HIM OF KILEY PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF ALL THE RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS CHERISH THE FREEDOM TO EARN A LIVING. TO WORK IN THE JOB OF OUR CHOICE. PERHAPS RECEIVES THE LEAST PROTECTION. OVERLY RESTRICTIVE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE REQUIREMENTS OUR SILENT JOB KILLER AND A CAUSE OF POVERTY. THIS IS A GROWING PROBLEM ACROSS THE NATION. MULTIPLE STUDIES FROM VARIOUS SUBPARTS OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. HIGHLIGHTED THE PROBLEMS WITH EXCESSIVE OFTEN ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT ROAD BLOCKS TO A JOB A PAYCHECK AND A CAREER WITH. AND THIS PROBLEM IS WORSE IN CALIFORNIA. THAN ANYWHERE ELSE THE INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE LABEL CALIFORNIA THE MOST BROADLY AN ONEROUS LEE LICENSE STATE IN THE NATION. AND THE WORST LICENSING ENVIRONMENT FOR WORKERS IN A LOWER INCOME OCCUPATIONS. IN FACT ONE IN FIVE INDIVIDUALS HERE MUST RECEIVE PERMISSION FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO WORK THE AVERAGE COST OF A LICENSES FOR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS AN INDIVIDUAL HAVE TO TAKE AN AVERAGE OF TWO LICENSING. EXAMS JUST A QUALIFIED TO WORK IN CALIFORNIA. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REYES SIMILAR CONCERNS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STATING THE STATE'S LICENSE LIGHTS ISN'T PROCESS OFTEN BARS INTRIGUED OCCUPATIONS AND IS NOT A THOUGHTFUL EXAMINATION OF HOW BEST TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. THE REPORT FOUND THAT CHANGES WERE NEEDED TO INCREASE UPWARD MOBILITY OF WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. FINALLY. THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE HAS ADVOCATED FOR OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING REFORM AT THE LOCAL STATE. AND FEDERAL LEVEL ARGUING THAT REDUCE REGULATIONS WILL CREATE MORE JOBS IN THE LICENSE FIELDS INCREASE CONSUMER ACCESS TO GOODS AND SERVICES AND LEAD TO LOWER PRICES ACROSS THE BOARD. WELL WE DO RIGHTFULLY RELY ON OCCUPATIONAL REGULATION FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION. THE BURDENS OF EXCESSIVE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING ARE OFTEN DISPROPORTIONATE OR ALTOGETHER UNRELATED TO THE ACTUAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS OF THE OCCUPATION. I'LL GIVE YOU JUST THREE EXAMPLES BUT TODAY'S BILL WILL IMMEDIATELY CORRECT. FIRST. EXISTING LAW IN CALIFORNIA ALLOWS ABOARD AND OR AGENCY. TO PROHIBIT INDIVIDUALS FROM OBTAINING OR RENEWING AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE IF THEY BE FALL BEHIND ON THEIR STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS. THIS POLICY NOT ONLY DENY SOMEONE THE RIGHT TO EARN A LIVING BUT IS OBVIOUSLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. LIMITING THE PERSON'S ABILITY TO EARN INCOME AND CATCH UP ON THE ISLANDS. SEC. CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS A BOARD AND OR AGENCY TO BAR LICENSURE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS FALLING BEHIND ON THEIR TAX PAYMENTS. ONCE AGAIN THIS IS A BLOW NOT JUST TO THE RIGHT TO EARN A LIVING BUT ALSO LIKELY. TO THE STATE TREASURY. THIRD. CALIFORNIA'S ONEROUS LICENSING LAWS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD. TO FIND JOBS. FORMER OFFENDERS ARE FREQUENTLY DENIED PROFESSIONAL LICENSES AND TYPICALLY HAVE NO ADVANCE GUIDANCE ON WHETHER A CONVICTION WOULD DISQUALIFY THEM FROM AN OCCUPATION SO THEY JUMP THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS ALL THE FEES COURSES AND TRAINING. ONLY TO BE DENIED. AB TWO FOUR NINE WOULD ALLOW A FORMER OFFENDER TO PETITION THE BORDER AGENCY TO NOTIFY THEM WHETHER THEY WILL QUALIFY FOR A LICENSE. AND THE SAD TRUTH COLLEAGUES IS THAT THESE REGULATIONS OFTEN FALL HARDEST ON THE LEAST ADVANTAGED IN OUR SOCIETY. PEOPLE WERE JUST TRYING TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING BUT OFTEN DO NOT HAVE THE TIME RESOURCES OR ABILITY TO NAVIGATE COMPLEX IN OFFICE OFTEN SENSELESS. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL THE OCCUPATIONAL OPPORTUNITY ACT HELPS TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM BY ELIMINATING ARBITRARY BARS TO LICENSURE AND ASSURING THAT RESTRICTIONS ON THE RIGHT TO EARN A LIVING ARE NO GREATER THAN NECESSARY. FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION. NOW I'M AWARE OF CONCERNS RAISED BY THE ANALYSIS AND DIE I AM WILLINGTON NARROW THE BILL MOVING FORWARD. AYE AYES IT IS HEADED TO AYE JUDICIARY NEXT TO GET OUT TODAY IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES THE COMMITTEE AND THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BUILDING OF CALIFORNIANS GREATER ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT TO AT OCCUPATIONAL OPPORTUNITY WHEN MAINTAINING THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. WITH ME TODAY IS HONEST ASIA FROM THE PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANA SEIZURE BODEN ATTORNEY WITH PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION. AND I REPRESENT WOULD BE WORKERS ENTREPRENEURS WHEN THEY FACE A RATIONAL BARRIERS TO EARNING A LIVING IN THE STATE. AB TWO FOUR NINE WOULD ADDRESS TWO OF THOSE BEARS HAVE GENERATED A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN THE MOVEMENT FOR OCCUPATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING REFORM. THE ROOM AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT LICENSURE IS NO LONGER RESTRICTED TWO OCCUPATIONS LIKE LAWYERS AND DOCTORS. NOWADAYS YOU NEED A LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA TO UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE TO TRIM TREES TO SHAMPOO HAIR OR TO APPLY MAKEUP. AND OFTEN THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS ARE ONEROUS IT TAKES FIFTEEN HOURS OF TRAINING IN TWO EXAMS TO GET A LICENSE TO SIMPLY WASH SOMEONE'S HAIR FOR MONEY. THAT'S TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING NEEDED TO GET A LICENSE TO BECOME AN EMT. AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE DO FOR THEMSELVES IN THEIR HOME ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH NO TRAINING AT ALL. AND THAT'S NOT A ONE OFF IS ASSEMBLYMAN KILEY SAID ON AVERAGE IT TAKES FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN DAYS OF TRAINING AND PASSING TWO EXAMS JUST ENTER A LOW INCOME OCCUPATION. SO MANY OF THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SAUDIS BEAR NO RELATIONSHIP TO PUBLIC SAFETY INSTEAD THEY SIMPLY PROTECT ENTRENCHED BUSINESS INTERESTS FROM COMPETITION. IF WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE ECONOMIC MOBILITY WE HAVE TO OFFER THEM A PATH TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP AB TWO FOUR NINE WOULD PREVENT LICENSING BODIES FROM DISQUALIFYING PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF UNPAID LOANS TAXES ARE CRIMINAL HISTORIES. WHICH HAVE NO BEARING ON PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. AB TWO FOUR NINE IS A MODEST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION GETTING RID OF SOME OF THE WORST CONSEQUENCES OF LICENSURE RUN AMOK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT NOW LIKE TO WELCOME OUR WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION WILL ALLOW UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WHEN ASSIST WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I I GUESS TO TO SUMMARIZE THE SOME OF THE POINTS RAISED BY THE. AUTHOR AND PROPONENTS REALLY DO SOUND SINCE WHAT I THINK THEY'RE IT THERE'S PROBABLY SOME COMMON GROUND THERE ON THE IDEA OF. LIMITING THE ABILITY FEEL TO BE DENIED LICENSES BASED ON STUDENT LOANS THINGS LIKE THAT BUT. THE FACT IS THAT THIS BILL KIND OF BLOWS OPEN THE PROCESS AND REALLY JEOPARDIZES EVEN THE EXISTENCE OF WHAT A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WORKER PROTECTION REGULATIONS FROM. HEALTH AND SAFETY TO A VARIETY OF OTHER AREAS THAT ON WE SHOULD BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ALLOW. SAY SOMEONE WITHOUT ANY EXPOSURE TO AN INDUSTRY TO APPLY FOR A LICENSE GET DENIED TOM TO GO THROUGH THE APPEAL PROCESS ALSO GET THAT I'D. AND THEN THEY CAN SUE IN COURT AGREED TO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHERE THEY CAN SUE. TO ESSENTIALLY OVERTURN ANY REGULATION AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE NEW VERSION OF THE BILL LIMITS IT TOO REGULATIONS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE BOARD. NOT. TERRIBLY CLEAR WHAT THAT MEANS BUT FOR EXAMPLE TO TAKE ON THE TREE TRIMMING THAT WAS RAISED BY THE ARM PROPONENTS. IT THE FOR ONE THIS IS A VERY VERY DANGEROUS OCCUPATION FACT WAS SO DANGEROUS THAT KOLCHAK TO ENACT A SPECIAL EMPHASIS PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE THERE WERE. TWELVE METALLIC HE'S IN A TWO YEAR PERIOD OF SIX OF THOSE OCCURRED IN A FOUR. FOUR OF THEM OCCURRED IN A SIX WEEK PERIOD. AND SO THERE ARE VERY GOOD REASONS FOR WHY WE HAVE A. YOU KNOW LONG BODY YOUR TREE TRIMMING SAFETY REGULATIONS AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ALLOW SOMEONE TO SUE AND THEN SAY. I THINK WE NEED TO OVERTURN ALL THE STREET TRIMMING SAFETY REGULATIONS AND SO THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. WHO LIKELY HAD LITTLE IF ANYTHING TO DO WITH AN ACTING THOSE REGULATIONS WOULD THEN BE FORCED TO GO TO COURT? AND PROVE BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT ALL OF THOSE TREE TRIMMING SAFETY REGULATIONS MEET. THEIR DEFINITIONS OUTLINED IN IN THE FIRST SECTION OF THIS BILL AND WHERE THEY TO FAIL TO DO THAT THE COURT IS EQUIRED TO ENJOY ALL THOSE REGULATIONS AND SO. IT CREATES THIS PROCESS WHERE AN AGENCY THAT WASN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REGULATION COULD BE FORCED TO DEFEND IT IN COURT. AND IF THEY FAIL TO MEET THE VERY HIGH BAR PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THEN THE ENTIRE REGULATION GETS AND JOIN THE COURTS REQUIRED TO JUST THROW THE WHOLE THING OUT. AND. WORKER SAFETY WOULD PRETTY CLEARLY WE BELIEVE BE JEOPARDIZED BY THAT. YOU'LL BE KIND OF AN UNPRECEDENTED SYSTEM WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THAT WOULD WORK WERE THE LICENSING BOARDS TO FIND THEMSELVES IN COURT OVER AND OVER TRYING TO. DEFEND REGULATIONS THAT THEY WEREN'T REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROMULGATING SO ARE FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IS OUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FORTY FIVE SECONDS I. FRED JONES ON BEHALF THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WHO WERE NOT. A UNIONIZED INDUSTRY. BUT WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MITCH MENTION THIS WE SEE THIS IS DEREGULATION VIA LITIGATION. AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A PATCHWORK OF CONFLICTING SUPERIOR COURT DECISIONS THAT OUR STATE BOARD OF FARMING BECAUSE INDOLOGY WHEN OUR INDUSTRY IS GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH. FOR THE MORE THAT THERE'S RECENT RESEARCH THAT INDICATES LICENSURE PROVIDES A ROAD LESSONS. EMPLOYMENT GAPS AMONG MINORITIES AND WOMEN. BECAUSE LICENSORS PROVIDE INFORMATION TO EMPLOYERS ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF THOSE LICENSEES SO LICENSURE DOES HAVE A VALUE. IN OUR CONNIE. AND JUSTIN INTERESTING HISTORICAL SIDE NOTE MENTIONING UNIONS EARLIER. AS PRIVATE SECTOR UNIONIZATION HAS DECREASED OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS. GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED INTO STEP SET STANDARDS VIA LICENSORS PROPORTIONALLY. SO IT'S TRUE THAT UNDER TEN PERCENT OF OUR ECONOMY WAS LICENSE FIFTY YEARS AGO NOW IT'S CLOSER TO A QUARTER. BUT THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT AND PROTECTING CONSUMERS AS UNIONIZATION HAS DECREASED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME TO MY FROM. HIM INFLATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. MARKS BEGINNING WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH EUROPE AFTER THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO POST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS VICE CHAIR BRO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SCOTTY UP THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR TODAY. I DO AGREE THAT SOME LICENSING% IS VERY BURDENSOME AND COULD BE A VERY TO EMPLOYMENT. BUT YOUR SPECIFIC MEASURE HERE TODAY SEEMS TO BE VERY BROAD. USUALLY IN SUNSET HEARINGS IS WILL WE TAKE UP THESE ISSUES UP. FOR. ONE BOARD HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESERVES AND WE QUESTION WHETHER THERE CHARGING THEIR LICENSEES TOO MUCH. OR OTHER BOARDS DON'T HAVE ANY DESERVES. WHO QUESTION WHAT THEY'RE GOING THEIR MONEY I'D BE INTERESTED IN YOUR THOUGHTS YOU SAID YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN POSSIBLY NARROWING HIS BILL? ABOUT TO GET A MEASURE THAT WOULD PASSED THE COMMITTEE TODAY. OF THE OPPOSITION MENTION MAYBE A STUDENT LOAN. THE ANGLE WHERE YOU WOULD GET YOUR LICENSE SUSPENSION I JUST BE INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR THOUGHTS ON MARRYING THE BILL TODAY. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AND THERE ARE AND. EH DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT ARE OUT THERE FOR HOW TO GO ABOUT NOW OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING REFORM IN A IN A SENSIBLE WAY. AND I THINK THERE'S A LEGITIMATE DEBATE AS TO WHICH OF THOSE APPROACHES IS VAST AND I ONE OF THOSE IS IN FACT KINDA. ANYTHING UP THE SUNSET AND SUNRISE REVIEW PROCESS. WE CHOSE TO GO WITH THAT THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT THAT ON STAGE YOU CAN GET INTO IT IN MORE DETAIL. BUT I YOU KNOW I I DO TAKE OUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT. OF THE COMMITTEE. AYE I PERSONALLY THINK WE DO NEED TO HAVE A MORE SYSTEMATIC. REFORM PROCESS AND I'M NOT SURE I AGREE THAT THIS IS GOING TO SET OFF A A FEEDING FRENZY OF OF LITIGATION I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN STATES THAT HAVE DONE THIS IS A JUST LEADS TO A GREATER CARE BEING TAKEN. OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REGULATION ARE PROPOSED IS ALIGNED WITH THE PUBLIC PROTECTION PURPOSE ON BUT I'D YOU KNOW A KNOWLEDGE AND THAT WE MIGHT NOT REACH AGREEMENT ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT. I AM WILLING TO LIMIT THE BALLOT I'VE CONVEYED THIS TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE TO I KIND OF THE THREE WHAT I'VE U. S. PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS. AND I YOU KNOW AYE REGRESSIVE AYE BARRIERS TO AYE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING. THAT I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS AND OTHERS AGAIN OUR NUMBER ONE. TO ELIMINATE THE. ABILITY TO RESTRICT SOMEONE FROM GETTING THEIR LICENSE JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE LATE WITH THE STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT. I NUMBER TWO I DOING THE SAME THING. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS. LATE OR CALL BEHIND ON THEIR TAXES. AND NUMBER THREE I LIMITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SOMEONE CAN BE DENIED OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE I JUST BECAUSE OF THE PAST CRIMINAL CONVICTION I'M AS WELL AS CREATING A PROCESS FOR SOMEONE TO BE OUT HALF THE BOARD BEFORE THEY GO THROUGH ALL THE STEPS. YOU KNOW BY GO THROUGH ALL THIS HE'S GONNA AUTOMATICALLY DENY ME BASED UPON THE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS I THINK THAT DOES A THREE PRETTY ARE COMMON SENSEMEASURES THAT I HOPE THE COMMITTEE CAN GET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SOMEONE BAKER THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER KILEY FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AND AND FOR POINTING OUT AS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM CONSTITUENTS IT'S NOT CONSTITUENTS OR TRYING TO GET. THE DOCTORS LICENSE OR THE LOTTERY BUT THAT THE CONSTITUENTS OR TRYING TO HAVE A MOST ENTRY LEVEL GREAT. JOBS TO BEGIN TO BUILD A CAREER THAT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS AND AND ALSO HOW LONG IT TAKES THIS ISN'T JUST A FUNCTION OF HAVING TO. WHICH IS A BARRIER THAT WE SHOULD ALSO BE WORKING ON I I LIKE THE WAY THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HEARING THE BILL. I HATE I DO WANT TO POINT OUT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT WOULD BE LEAVING OUT THE RIGHT ACTION. TYPE I JUST MIGHT MAKE THE OBSERVATIONS THIS THIS BODY HAS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND HAS SUITS AGAINST BUSINESSES THAT EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE WAY AND WHATEVER IT'S THE POSSIBILITY OF MAYBE SAM. THE STATE AND ADMITTEDLY I THINK THE BILL IS A BIT BROAD IN THAT RESPECT SUING THE STATE THAT'S WHERE. WE HEAR A LOT OF OPPOSITION THAT SUDDENLY WE CAN'T ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO BE HELD TO THE SAME LAWSUIT STANDARD BUT. I AM I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. ON THIS THE. OTHER POP YOU KNOW IF YOU WOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT ANCHOR JUST DO THE SAME THERE'S THERE'S DIFFERENT GRADATIONS OF HOW WE MIGHT REGULATE. INDUSTRIES AND AND AND AND PROFESSIONS WE HAD A CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSION THIS MORNING OVER ONE BILL. AND THAT WE HEARD FROM OUR GOOD COLLEAGUE ON THE COMMITTEE FROM SAN MATEO WHERE YOU HAVE ATHLETIC TRAINERS IN THE PAST THERE'S BEEN BILLS ABOUT TITLE REGULATION. PAT AND AND BEFORE SOMEONE CAN PUT THEMSELVES OUT WITH A CERTAIN TITLE THAT YOU'RE AN ATHLETIC TRAINER THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE MET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THERE'S ABOARD THE KID. YOU KNOW IDENTIFY THAT BUT. I ENCOURAGE AS YOU'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS TO LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY OF GRADATIONS INSTEAD IT'S EITHER A LICENSE OR IT'S NOTHING. AND WE'VE GOT TO BE MUCH MORE INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE ABOUT HOW WE ARE DOING THAT. NOT JUST IN THE NAME OF WORK PROTECTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF THOSE IN A POT OF OTHER PLACES IN STATE LAW. AND WE DON'T WANT TO WATER THERE'S DOWN NECESSARILY BUT FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND. HAVE YOU PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO HAVING GRADATIONS ALONG THOSE LINES OR WOULD THAT BE PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS BE WILLING TO HAVE WITH CHAIR TO HELP YOUR BILL GET OUT WHICH I HOPE WILL DO TODAY. HAD THAT ABSOLUTE PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE AND I THINK THAT TIME YOU KNOW THAT. SORT OF LEAST RESTRICTIVE. STANDARD IS KIND OF EMBODIED IN THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE IN THE BELT BUT THERE ARE OTHER KIND OF OUR MODEL STATUTES THAT OTHER STATES HAVE PURSUED THAT MAKE THAT EXPLICIT. AND SORT OF I'LL LAY OUT A HIERARCHY. OF OF REGULATIONS IN TERMS OF AYE YOU KNOW MOST LEAST BURDENSOME I GUESS JUST BEING LIKE THE FREE MARKET MOST BURDENSOME BEING. OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE RIGHT BIMBOS PERSON SOME AND I SAID REQUIRING THE SUNSET AND SUNRISE REVIEW PROCESS TO ASSURE AYE THAT THERE IS A GOOD FIT BETWEEN THE BURDEN HOW BURDENSOME THE REGULATION IS. AND I AND WHAT THE PARTICULAR PUBLIC PROTECTION MRS SO THAT'S I ABSOLUTELY A CONVERSATION THAT I'D LOVE TO I HADN'T AS ISSUES FOR THEM AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IN MY. SHORT TIME HERE EXACTLY WHEN SOMEBODY GETS THE LICENSING REQUIREMENT IMPOSED ITS I GOT THE LICENSE AND NOW I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY ELSE TO. AND I ALSO WANT THERE TO BE FEES THAT BE CREATED VERY I WANT MORE STEPS TO BE DONE. ITS OUR JOB AND DUTY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE LOOKING AT CONSUMER PROTECTION I THINK IT'S A AND AND THE QUALITY OF CARE AND INFORMATIONS ARE GOING TO RECEIVE. BUT. WE'VE GOT TO BE OPENING UP PATHWAYS TO CAREERS WE'VE GOT TO BE OPEN UP PATHWAYS TO CHIP GOOD JOBS IN THIS IS A VERY THIS IS A PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK IT'S A A BADGE OF HONOR WHEN WHEN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT HIS LICENSING SOMETHING NECESSARILY GOT TO REALLY LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF IT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SO MUCH. SO MANY BARRIERS TO THAT SO I HOPE ENCOURAGE THAT WE MOVE THIS FORWARD WITH THAT NARROW COMMON SENSE MEASURES THE THREE THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. AND IF YOU WANT TO THROW IN THE MIX THE POSSIBILITY OF GRADATIONS THAT MIGHT HELP AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS SORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A MEMBER FONG. A AYE AYES ONE ECHO. WHAT IS IN THEIR BAKER AND HAS SAID THAT I PERSONALLY APPLY THIS EFFORT CAN YOU CAN YOU AND I GUESS SHED SOME LIGHT IN TERMS OF? HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN DENIED THEIR LICENSES DUE TO OVER OR BURDENSOME THAT LICENSING AND WE DO HAVE AN EXTENT TO HAVE A RANGE? AYE SIR WITH PERMISSION MISTER CHAIRMAN I ABOUT MY ONCE AND FOR THAT QUESTION. CERTAIN. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. CURRENTLY IT SEEMS THAT THAT THE TAXES THE ABILITY FOR BOARDS TO DENY PEOPLE LICENSE BASED ON UNPAID TAXES RIGHT NOW AT LA ONLY PERMITS LICENSE AT PORTS TO DO THAT FOR THE MOST EGREGIOUS OFFENDERS BUT IT IS. THEY ARE STILL ABLE THE BOARDS ARE STILL ABLE TO ENACT REGULATIONS OF THAT SORT IN THE FUTURE SO THIS WOULD BE A PROPHYLACTIC MEASURE. TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO OR DISCOURAGE THEM FROM DOING THAT IN THE FUTURE AND PROMOTE WE KNOW WHEN I WHEN I REPRESENT PEOPLE THESE LAWSUITS A LOT OF TIMES. THEY DON'T EVEN APPLY FOR A LICENSE BECAUSE THEY JUST ASSUME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BEAT DENIED SO EVEN IF WE HAVE A LACK OF INFORMATION REGARDING HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEEN DENIED WHAT WE DON'T SEE IS HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER EXCEPT FOR TO EVEN APPLY BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT. THEY WERE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO MEET THE CRITERIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT MAY AS US IN THEIR BIGGEST IS THIS THIS IS ABOUT CAREERS. HE BUT A PROBABILITY AND WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE PATH TO TO REACH HIM WHATEVER TAD A LOT WOULD WHATEVER CAREER GOALS THAT THEY WANT. AND SO WE NEED TO REEXAMINE I THINK. AND THE BURDENS I THINK UP THE STATE PLACES IN PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM LEAVING STARTING THEIR CAREER IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME SOME MCCAULEY DO WISH TO CLOSE. I YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION AND FOR THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AGAIN I'M AYE AYE COMMITMENT AS WE MOVE THIS SITE IF WE MOVES FOR TO JUDICIARY WHICH I BELIEVE MISTER OUT YOU AND STE REPORTER ON SO THEY CAN. REYES HALIFAX IF THINGS LOOK DIFFERENT STAUGHTON LIKES TO DO THAT JUDICIARY ALL THE TIME. I IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THREE THINGS NUMBER ONE THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN'T GET A LICENSE IF YOU'LL ANDERSON LOAN PAYMENTS I DON'T AND THAT'S FAIR ON THAT MAKE SENSE. NUMBER TO THE YOU CAN GET A LICENSE IF YOU'RE AYE BEHIND YOUR TAXES ITEM THAT'S GONNA MAKE SENSE THE NUMBER THREE THAT WE REALLY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF FORMER OFFENDERS TO BE ABLE TO GET A LICENSE TO PURSUE A CAREER. I WHICH I THINK IS ESSENTIAL TO REHABILITATION SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIVE UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AYE MR KILEY I APPRECIATE OF THE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU PROVIDED IN PRESENTING THIS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS YOU MAY KNOW THIS COMMITTEE HAS FOCUSED ON THAT CONSUMER PROTECTION.
