IT'S NOT LIKE YOU SEE IT BIGGER THAT SELF AND YOU I RECEIPT CONTINUES TO INCREASE BUT IT ALSO GIVES A SENSE OF SCALE RELATIVE TO WHAT THE STATE EXPERT IT'S DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE- THE LOWER IT GRAY LAW. NO HOPE TO IMPART FIGURE IS NOT ONLY OBVIOUSLY THAT THE MAN DIFFERENCES BUT HOW QUICKLY THE STATE HAS GONE FROM WHAT IS A NORMAL WORKLOAD AT EIGHTY THAN NORMAL LABOR MARKET FOR ECONOMIC EXPANSION SCHOOL CRISIS.

AND EARLIER FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGE AND THAT FOOT THOSE FUNDS HAVE JUST AND IN TWO. SEPARATE COMPONENTS TO THE STATE IN RECENT MONTHS AND HAVE BEEN USED TO ADDRESSED THE INCREASED WORKLOAD AS WELL THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RE DIRECTED- FOURTEEN HUNDRED STAFF MEMBERS FROM OTHER BRANCHES WITH EDT TO THE Y. BRANCH AT. OTHER AGENTS IS TO THE RIGHT. HELLO THE MORE WE DEVELOPMENT IN THE STAFFING ARENA RELATES TO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING UNDER AN EXISTING- FINANCING SYSTEM- THE SORT OF UNDERLIES THE STATE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP FOR YOU WHY I IN ESSENCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR BASED STATE ADMIN COSTS REALLY PROGRAM I WITH THESE IT'D WORK HELLO ON FIRST STATE IS IN THE PROCESS OF HIGH. PRODUCT I THOUGHT I DID STOP NOT. I'M FIVE WE TURN THE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT DVDS WERE. WHAT FIRST POINT OUT THAT SINCE MID MARCH EDIE HAS PROCESSED AND DISTRIBUTED MORE THAN FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO UNEMPLOYED WORKERS. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE DEFENSE AUGMENTATIONS SHE WHY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IS A FEDERALLY SOURCED FUNDS ALTHOUGH- THAN TEN BILL DOLLARS OF THAT AMOUNT- CORRESPONDS TO. TICKLE OR NORMAL UNEMPLOYMENT. RATES OF THAT THE STATE'S PROGRAM THAT ARE. FUNDED BY AN EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX AND PAID FOR OUT OF THE STATE YOU I TRUST FOR. SIX FINAL THE HAND WE LOOK CLOSELY AT CROSS WORK AND SPECIFICALLY AT TIMELINESS OF PAYMENT OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE SUBJECT. OF TODAY'S HEARING AND DESPITE THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BOTH FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THE STATE LEVEL PROVIDE DDD IN RECENT MONTHS THERE CLEARLY WERE. STE CONCERN. THAT EIGHTY IS. MAY NOT HAVE A CAPACITY AT THIS TIME TO. ISSUE YOU AYE BENEFITS IN A PROMPT FASHION- BUT FOUR POINT OUT THAT THEIR CURRENT. CLAIMS PROCESSING WORKLOAD IS AT AN ALL TIME HISTORIC HI- IN APRIL MAY AND JUNE SO THE SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR. BURKE EDT PROCESS ON OUR BETWEEN POINT MILLION AND TWO POINT MILLION UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM FOR MONTH THIS IS THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE HIGHEST MONTHLY PEAK DURING THE GREAT RISK TURN. AT ABOUT TWENTY TIMES HIGHER THAN A NORMAL MONTHS WORKLOAD FOR EDT. AND I THINK THE POINT IN THE NEXT WEEK WE HOPE TO CLARIFY IS THAT. MOST CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THE EDT ARE PROCESSED IN AN AUTOMATED FASHION- BUT APART AND REFERS THESE CLAIMS IS CLEAN CLAIMS AND BY THIS I MEAN THAT THAT THE STATE USES AUTOMATED STAFFS SAYS NAMES STEP WILL TAKE THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE UNEMPLOYED WORKER AND NOT. THOSE TO OTHER STATE DATABASES TO CONFIRM THE IDENTITY OF THE CLAIMANT BUT ALSO TO CONFIRM THEIR WAGES AND ONCE THOSE PIECES OF INFORMATION ARE CONFIRMED THE EDT. ELIGIBILITY AND WHAT THE WEEKLY BENEFIT AMOUNT WHICH WOULD BE AND THEN ISSUES THAT BENEFIT BUT IN IN A IN A MINORITY OF CASES. EITHER THE DEMOCRATS MISSION OR THE IMP A SALARY OR WAGE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE UNEMPLOYED WORKER DON'T MATCH STATE DATABASES AND IN THESE CASES. EDT HAS THEM MANUALLY USING CONSIDERABLE STAFF TIME- REDIRECT- SORT OF RE OPENED THE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE CLAIMANT TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION TO. VERIFY THEIR THEIR EMPLOYMENT HISTORY OR PERHAPS CORRECT- AN INCORRECT SO SECURITY NUMBER IT WAS WRITTEN ON APPLICATION THESE ARE THE CLAIM THAT TAKE A LENGTHY PERIOD IN OFFICE OFTEN EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT. ACE. AND I MAY I. BECAUSE THE PRO IS A FEDERAL PARTNERS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED SOME PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR STATES AND ONE OF THE KEY PERFORMANCE TARGETS THAT THEY'VE ESTABLISH IS WHAT THEY CALL FIRST BENEFIT TIMELINESS- AND THIS IS BASICALLY THAT THE NUMBER OF DAYS BETWEEN NINE AND AN APPLICATION IS. WHAT AND WENT OUT THE PAYMENT BUT ON WORK RECEIVE HIS OR HER FOR BENEFIT% UNDER THE FEDERAL SETS OF THE TARGET. THAT EIGHTY SEVEN PER OF CLAY. ARE ART WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS AND HIS. FORMAL CIRCUM THE STATE. IS ABLE TO PAY ABOUT DAYS. IN THE SECOND THIS YEAR SO I MADE THIS INCREASED WORKLOAD THE STATE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ISSUE. FIFTY TWO. WITHIN TWO ONE DAYS IS A SLIGHT SO THAT US I OF 69% OTHER STATES AS WELL ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS NEW WORKLOAD- AND ONE THING I WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHEN EIGHTY ALL HAD CHALLENGES WITH ISSUING BENEFITS PROMPTLY ON. AT THAT TIME THAT THE DEPARTMENT A TO ISSUE A OFFERS BENEFITS PAYMENTS AND IN TWENTY ONE DAYS ALSO IN ABOUT 62% OF CASES- SOURCING SOME SIMILAR BETWEEN TODAY'S WORK RESPONSIVENESS AND THAT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION DESPITE.

WELL AT THIS YEAR'S A QUESTIONS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND REALLY START WITH UNDERSTANDING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM. LEGISLATORS IN THE PRESS HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY ASKING DIRECTOR HILLIARD- YOU ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE BACKLOG OF THESE UNPAID CLAIMS AND WE'VE HEARD YOU CALL SIMPLY DOCK AND AVOID ANSWERING THESE. ON TO GIVE IF TEMPLES EARLIER THIS YEAR. LOCAL CBS STATIONS ANALYZE DATA THAT SHOW THAT THREE OUT OF FIVE INITIAL CLAIMS AND NOT YET THE PAGE. HE SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TRACK HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD CLAIMS APPROVED TONIGHT HEY. ON JULY THE SIXTH. DIRECTOR HILLIARD YOU MET WITH THE LEGISLATURE COORDINATION GROUP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION DOZENS OF LEGISLATORS AS YOU WILL REMEMBER. ARE SIMPLY BUDGET CHAIR. ASKED YOU HOW MANY CLAIMS RUN PAID. YOU SAID AND I QUOTE. A HUNDRED THOUSAND. NOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS NO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND QUOTE. TWO DAYS LATER JULY EIGHTH ONE ASKED HOW MANY CLAIMS FOR UNPAID YOUR SPOKESPERSON SAID QUOTE THAT'S A VERY SMALL. VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE PROBABLY LESS THAN 1% NOT A ON JULY EIGHTH THIS IS A MARK REPORTED. BASED ON FEDERAL DEPARTMENT LABORS TO. AS THE END OF MAY. AFTER THE FIRST THREE A PANDEMIC THAT ONE POIN EIGHT EIGHT MILLION. ALMOST MILLION ON THE CLAIMS FILED. WERE YET TO BE. DR HILLIARD. WHY DID YOU LIE TO US WHY HAVE YOU BEEN THIS IN FROM THE PUBLIC. I WOULD NEVER LIE TO THE PUBLIC OR TO THE LEGISLATIVE BODY- MY I CAN'T SPEAK TO- ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU CITED BUT CAN'T SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT. IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR A COLD YEAH- THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WILL. TO HEAR. NOT THE WAY THAT OUR IT. SIGNED OF THE OLD ANTIQUATED SYSTEM SO WE HAD TO DO MANY. SPECIAL IN ORDER TO GET AT THE HEARTOF THE PERCENTAGES AND I DON'T KNOW WHY- IN MIND THAT WE'RE FINALLY TO GET A CALL THE DAY. AND IT'S BEEN SO PEOPLE COULD HAVE IT THAT IT WASN'T PUBLICIZED. SO ON AND THAT WAS ARE YOU KNOW WE JEFF FINISH THE VERY INTENSIVE DIFFICULT Q. AND A VERY OLD SYSTEM AND HAVE THE PROPER DATA TO WHICH TO SHOW. SO ALL ABOUT. AND THIS EVERYONE SEE WHAT THE DATA IS BUT AT THE STATE NEEDS TO BE CORRECT IN ORDER TO PUT IT OUT THERE AND I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE IT I DO WANT TO PUTTING IT OUT UNTIL IT WAS READY. SEC SO I ALSO WANT. THANK MR DAILY WHO I'M GOING TO BE JOINING IN HIS LEGISLATION WHERE WE NEED TO SEE WEEKLY DATA REALLY UNDERSTAND METRICS OF WHERE WE ARE AS WE ARE HOPEFULLY GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS. A BEGINNER PERCENT OUT. SAYING THAT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT WERE UNRESOLVED CECINA MILLION. AND AS I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WE'RE WONDERING WHAT MAKES THESE NUMBERS MORE BELIEVABLE THAN WHAT'S BEEN SEVEN PASSED. IN AS I LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS YOU SEE A MILLION. DIFFERENT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE ALL WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ONE NUMBER LESS. BUT THERE'S OTHER NUMBER. OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND FOLKS NEED ET RESOLUTION MEANING YOU HAVE INFORMATION YOU NEED. A QUARTER MILLION CALIFORNIANS STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED TAX AND I KNOW IT'S CONVENIENT TO SAY LESS THAN A MILLION BUT FROM YOUR OWN NUMBERS IT APPEARS THAT ONE POINT ONE THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN FULLY PAID IN THEIR CLAIMS RIGHT. FOR PAYMENT- AT THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND AND THE ACTUAL ITEMS THAT EDT- NEED TO TAKE ACTION ON AND ARE DELAYED. A LARGER VERSION FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND CLAIMANTS- ARE ELIGIBLE TO BUY BUT HAVE NEVER GONE INTO THE SYSTEM TO CERTIFY. THAT IS SOMETHING A FROM OFTEN NOT ALONE THAT WE- NOTED. MONTH HELLO CLAIM AND DIRECTOR THAT WE- THREE HAD SEVENTY CLAIM LAP MONTH IN REMINDING THEM HEY GOING CERTIFIED SO YOU CAN GET YOUR BENEFIT. AS A RESULT WE SAW THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHEN IN THIS SORT OF BY RIGHT AWAY AND 60% WERE PAID. SO BASED ON THAT WERE NOW PENDING- EMAIL- ONGOING AND TO ORDER TO HELP PEOPLE EDUCATE PEOPLE SO THEY KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD GO AND CERTIFIED. FOR WHAT. AND I UNDER A COUPLE BECAUSE PROGRAM AND PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THEY HAVE. TO GO IN EVERY TWO WEEKS AND ACTUALLY SIR. SO WITH THIS ADDITIONAL. I THINK THAT WILL WILL REALLY BE OFFENSIVE. WHY OTHER AREA WITH ABOUT DATA THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING ON A DATA DASHBOARD- WE'RE FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT BUT WERE WAITING FOR THE TRACK TEAM TO COME IN WE REALLY LIKE THEM TO PAY A LOOK AT. IT ADD THAT. LATER ON OR THEY MAY HAVE SOME OTHER IDEAS C WE WANT TO MAKE THE DATA USEFUL AT FOR EVERYBODY AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO UPDATE. COOLEY AGAIN WERE A- BY THE STRIKE TEAMS WHO THEY BEGIN. AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY DESPERATE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS AS IT'S OF. UP WHEN YOU YESTERDAY COMMITTED THAT YOU WERE GOING TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NUMBER EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NUMBER. THE DIFFERENCE OF. POINT TWO MILLION YEAH WHICH NUMBER. IF YOU. THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE DOLLARS IN THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT OUR OUR RESOURCES LATER FOCUSED ON IN ORDER TO DROUGHT THE BACKLOG BECAUSE THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WE HAVE IN IN WHICH WE CAN TAKE ACTION- OTHER- THE OTHER BUCKETS ARE NOT ACTUAL FOR US PEOPLE DON'T GO IN AND CERTIFY THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT. THEY DO HOWEVER LIKE I SAID WE ARE NOW GOING IN AND SEND EMAILS TO PROP PEOPLE TO HELP THEM NOW THAT IF THEY WERE AND OF COURSE. THEY'RE NOT. IF I CAN A VERY LOW TIME COMMITTING TO AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF THAT WILL BE RESOLVED BY BACK LIKE SHE CAN JUST GIVE US A NUMBER. THIRTY NINE HAPPENED TO THE OTHER EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE. IT THE CLAIM HATE WELL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT AS DIRECTOR LET'S FOCUS ON THAT ALMOST MILLION CALIFORNIANS IT'S A LARGE GROUP THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS BUT YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION. YOUR HONOR PORTAL DOESN'T OR CONSTITUENTS WHAT MORE INFORMATION NEEDED HE NEEDS. IT DOESN'T SEND CATIONS TO THE CONSTITUENTS THAT SPECIFIED WHAT INFORMATION YOU NEED OUR CONSTITUENTS CAN'T REACH PEOPLE THROUGH YOUR CALL CENTERS TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED SO HOW ON EARTH. ARE THESE IT EARNED ONE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS SUPPOSED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESOLVE THEIR CLAIMS. THAT NUMBER ONE. YEAH SO WE DO A NUMBER OF THINGS IN COMMUNICATION WE SEND EMAILS WE SEND NOTIFICATION- NOTICES WE HAVE UPDATED OUR FAQS OUR WEBSITE WE'RE DOING PRESS RELEASES. WE'RE EVERYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLY THING OF TWO AND THE THAT WAY TO AND HE OUR CLEAN WE ALSO AS I'M- DID BE DOING IT CAN. YEAH PEOPLE OR OR. VERY ACTION AT SOME POINT. WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE IS GOING INTO. SO AGAIN IF I CAN JUST I JUST MAKE SURE I'M OR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SAYING YOUR ONLY COMMITTING AT THIS TIME. TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER. BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER SO SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THIS ALL STARTED. TO RESOLVE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND. CLAIMS AGAIN POTENTIALLY LEAVING A MILLION PEOPLE HANGING. IF I CAN I THINK I'M GOING ON THIS I'M JUST A ONE MORE QUESTION IN THIS AREA A LITTLE AND I JUST WANT TO ADD I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A CORRECT CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NUMBERS IN HEAR YOU SAYING THAT YOUR- BOBBI THE SUCH IS IN. EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE FIVE. MAYBE ALL WITH ADDITIONAL. RELATED TO ONGOING EMAIL BETWEEN OCCASIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMER KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO CERTIFY- ABSOLUTELY WE'RE GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENING LET ME JUST AND WITH THE ABOUT MY COMMITMENT ON THAT I'M GONNA MAKE I'M GONNA MAKE. A I'M GONNA. I'M GONNA ASK. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. THE FORMER CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT MARTY MORGANSTERN. ONE IS ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT AT THAT TIME EDT HAD A BACKLOG OF UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND HE SAID THAT THE CONTINUING DELAYS WERE UNACCEPTABLE AND WITH GOVERNOR BROWN SUPPORT IN ORDER WAS MADE TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE PROCESS OF PAYING BACK LAW CLAIMS FOR CONTINUE BENEFITS PRIOR TO A FINAL THE TRIP. THE BILL ANOTHER WORDS RATHER THAN IN ONE MILLION PLUS INDIVIDUALS AS POTENTIAL SUSPECTS WE GOT THEM HELP. IS SOMETHING THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT WILL CONSIDER. AS I MENTIONED THAT THE DAY ONE WE REDUCE EL REQUIREMENTS AND- ARE AUTOMATICALLY PAYING- ARE GOING TO THE PROCESS ALREADY SO WE'VE ALREADY STREAMLINED IT AND DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN- DEPARTMENT LABOR WE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S A FEDERAL. I ASK YOU I'M ASKING A QUICK QUESTION YESTERDAY NO WILL YOU CONSIDER. MOVING FORWARD IN ORDER TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN PAYING BACKLOG CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS. SO WE DID THAT IN APRIL AND MAY AND DEPARTMENT OF LABOR CITED% US AND- WE HAD TO STOP THAT. AND I COULD I MEAN COULD YEAH THAT WAS THE THAT THEY WERE. LOOKING FOR MANY WITH THAT WE DID THAT AND THAT PRACTICE ANNA WASN'T IN CONTROL- WHAT DID NOT CONFORM WITH FEDERAL LOCK SO WE SEE. YEAH WE GET UP PROVIDING VERY CALM ANSWER TO WERE LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS HERE WE'RE LOOKING FOR RESULTS- AND I'M GOING TO SEE MY TIE BACK TO THE CHAIR LOTS OF OTHER QUESTIONS BUT THE LOOKING FORTY THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU. MISS BETWEEN NORTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AT DIRECTOR HIRED AS- AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS THE TWO THINGS I REALLY WANTED TO GET INTO OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. AND THE DEPARTMENTS TECHNOLOGY SO STARTING WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS THAT YOU ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK AND THAT'S ACTUALLY IS I'VE- I'VE HEARD YOU GET PREVIOUSLY SO. I HAVE WHAT ARE THE OPENING HOURS YOUR CALL CENTER RIGHT. WE HAVE TO CENTERS RIGHT NOW- OUR- MAIN ONE IS ON MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY EIGHT AS WELL. AND THEN WE HAVE A SECONDARY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM EIGHT TWO EIGHT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. OKAY SO. I AND IF I'M CORRECT THE- CALL CENTER THAT STAFF WITH ACTUAL TRAINED CASEWORKERS IS OPEN FROM EIGHT AM TO. PM MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY IS CRACKS THEIR TECHNICAL. I MEAN UP ALL OF OUR GO AGENT- HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF- ASSISTANT BUT- SO DO YOU OKAY HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY DO WE HAVE CASE WORKERS WHO ARE ONLY WORKING FOUR HOURS A DAY. THE OTHER OUR THIRD ROUND PAYING BENEFITS. THAT WE WHAT I MEAN AFTER PRIMARY- YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BENEFITS ARE PAYMENT TO GO OUT THE DOOR IS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO WE NEED. THERE ARE SOME LEVEL HUMAN IMPRESSION OF NEED FOR. PROCESSING NOT ALL OF THEM GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY. HOURS ON THE PHONE WAITING FOR SOMEBODY TO PICK UP AND THEN WHEN THEY PICK% UP AND IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON. YOUR TOLD SORRY ARE. TRAINED SKILLED ACTUAL CASE WORKERS ARE ONLY HERE FROM EIGHT AM TO TWELVE PM. I CAN. TRY TO ATTACK THE SYSTEM WHICH- NOTHING. I'M SO I GUESS I WOULD ARGUE. THAT AT EIGHTY AM TO TWELVE PM IS NOT WORKING THE CLOCK. ATM EXCEPT FOR A SMARTER. AT SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHEN ARE WE GOING TO EXTEND THE HOURS AND PROVIDE SERVICE. ALL DAY FROM EIGHT AM TO FIVE PM. SO I THINK I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO COMBINE THE CALL CENTER THE TWO OF THEM INTO ONE SO WE PROVIDE. SERVICE FROM EIGHT EIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS GREAT- I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT DATE. I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT DATE. AT ABOUT. I APOLOGIZE IN A FOR. I KNOW THAT WE'RE ON AND IT'S TIME CLOCK I GOT A MY FIVE SO I'M JUST GONNA COMPANY SO WE CAN MAKE MUCH PROGRESS IS POSSIBLE. I'M OKAY SORRY WHAT WHEN ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO- DELIVER ON THAT GOAL AND HAVE OUR CALL CENTER IS OPEN FROM EIGHT TO EIGHT. THEY ARE CURRENTLY OPEN FROM EIGHT EIGHT YOU KNOW YOU WILL BE. LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN BINDING ACTUAL CASE WORKERS FROM EIGHT TO EIGHT. WE DO HAVE FULLY TRAINED ON THE EIGHT EIGHT. YEAH WE AIM TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR- SKILLS OF OUR OUR FOLKS EVERY DAY. BUT WE'RE ADDING MORE AND WHAT WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF TRAINING EVERY WEEK THAT ARE FULLY TRAINED FOR CLAIM PROCESSING- BEING ADDED TO THE POND AS WE SPEAK. RIGHT SO THIS CALL CENTER THAT'S RIGHT NOW OPEN FROM EIGHT AM TO TWELVE PM. IF YOU'VE SAID YOUR TARGET IS TO EXTEND THE APRS FOR EIGHT AM TO EIGHT PM WHEN IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN.SO LIKE I SAID WE ALREADY ARE OPEN EIGHT TO EIGHT AND WE DO PROVIDE BOTH TECHNICAL AND CLAIMS- THAT SYSTEMS AND WE'RE ADDING MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRAINED TO HELP TO THE FULL GAMUT. AND A ROLLING OFF ON TO THAT TECHNICAL LINE EVERY DAY DIRECTOR YOU'RE NOT IN THE ROOMS YOU'RE NOT SEEN THE NUMBER OF EYES ROLLING AND THE NUMBER OF EXASPERATED FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE AS YOU ARE. CONTINUING TO FAIL TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION IT IT HONESTLY IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO ANSWER IT DOES NOT GIVE ME ANY FAITH THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO ACHIEVE. THE GOALS AND THE TARGET THAT YOU SHARED WITH THE PART OF YOUR OPENING REMARKS. WITH THAT BEING SAID MAYBE NOT. FOR CONSIDER HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD. THAT YOUR CALL BACK LAST HAS A FOUR TO SIX WEEK WAIT TIME IS THAT TRUE. RIGHT NOW IT IS UP FORTY SIX WEEKS- WASTE TIME ON THE COLLEGE. OKAY AGAIN DO YOU THINK THAT IS ACCEPTABLE. NO ABSOLUTELY NOT OKAY- AND WHAT IS THE TARGET CALL THAT TIME THAT YOU HAVE SET FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT. I ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF DOING CALL BACK THAT'S WHY WE'RE UPGRADING OUR CALL CENTERS SO WE CAN HAVE. A FULLY TRAINED STAFF FROM EIGHT TO EIGHT ONE VIRTUAL CALL CENTER AND PROVIDING FULL SERVICE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. SO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE- PUTTING FULLY TRAINED PEOPLE INTO OUR EIGHT EIGHT TECHNICAL. SO THEY CAN ANSWER GOAL SERVICE QUESTIONS. UNDERSTOOD THAT AGAIN YOU SEVERAL TIMES MENTIONED THE INITIATIVE YOU HAVE UNDER WAY TO UPGRADE THE CALL CENTER TO PROVIDE FULL SERVICE FROM EIGHT AM TO EIGHT PM AND THAT'S YOUR NUMBER ONE GOAL SO WHEN IS THAT GOING TO COME ONLINE. I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT DATE OF THAT WAR WE'RE STARTING WITH SKILL BASED ROUTING- TO SO CALLED GO INTO VERY DIFFERENT BUCKETS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO GROUND THE ISSUE. TO HELP THE CUSTOMER AND- ALSO MAKE IT EASIER TO PROCESS THE WHATEVER THE CONCERN IS SO THAT IS BEING ROLLED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER. I GIL BATES ROUTING MOVING ON TO- WORKING ON DOING THE CONSOLIDATION I JUST DON'T HAVE A FINAL DAY ON THE CONSOLIDATION. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROJECT PLAN IS NUMBER ONE LIKE CLEAR GOALS AND DELIVERABLES AND NUMBER TWO AN ACTUAL TARGET TIME LINES EVERYBODY'S WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL SO IF WE PAID FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DELAY AND THEY HAVEN'T EVEN GIVEN YOUR PROJECT PLAN. WITH ACTUAL TIMELINETHEN I THINK YOU NEED TO ASK FOR YOUR MONEY BACK. I'M A CAT B. NINE AT A LITTLE BIT SO. QUICKLY I WANT TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IN YOUR DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THAT MODERNIZATION PROJECT WAS GOING TO TAKE A LEVIN YEARS. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT- WE FOLLOW THAT THE POWER PROCESS SET BY TAKE A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF THE ANSWER IS YES FOR JESUS CONTINUE. I'M OKAY I SO DURING THE PANDEMIC YES DURING THE PANDEMIC WE'VE BECOME AWARE THAT A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY OVERHAULED THEIR YOU AYE SYSTEMS IN A MATTER OF MONTHS OR EVEN WEEKS ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT HAVE YOU READ THE STORIES AND SEEN THE NEWS ARTICLES ABOUT THE SUCCESSES THAT OTHER STATES HAVE HAD IN THIS- IN THIS. EVERY STATE IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION OF BARS WHERE THEIR SYSTEM IS MORE FULLY MODERNIZERS AND SUMMER. I AM MORE ANTIQUATED AND THAT SO IT ALL DEPENDS WHERE THEY ARE IN THE IN THE PROCESS. HAVE YOU AT ANY POINT. REACHED OUT TO YOUR COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER STATES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFORM THEIR DELIVERY SYSTEM IN A MATTER OF WEEKS AND MONTHS RATHER THAN. THE YEARS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE US. ABSOLUTELY WE PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION WORKFORCE MINISTRY- AND MEET RITE AID AT THE COLLECTIVE NATION. TO CARE ABOUT. WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING. AND I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY- STATE THAT HAS- MODERNIZE UP UNDER MY WHOLE YOU AYE SYSTEM IN MIND. AT ARE THERE ARE BEEN COUPLE OF STATES WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LAUNCH A CLOUD BASED SYSTEM US AND LEVERAGING LIKE AMAZON'S DELIVERY PLATFORM IN. THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE ALONG SIDE THEIR LEGACY SYSTEM I'M TO HAVE YOU CONTACTED THE VENDORS AND THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE DELIVERED. SOLUTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN THE FIELD NOW AND WORKING. YEAH I AM VERY EXCITED TO HAVE THE STRIKE FORCE- COME IN AND HELP WITH THAT TO SEE IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT- COULD BE CONSIDERED. I KNOW- JENNIFER WHO'S GOING TO HEAD UP THE STRIKE TEAM HAS GREAT TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND. SO I AM THRILLED TO HAVE ROB FORD. RIGHT I'M SO I THINK THAT. I THINK THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE STRIKE TEAM IS GOOD I WISH HAD COME EARLIER BUT- MY CONCERN IS THAT ALL OF THESE TIME LINES JUST SEEM TOTALLY OUT OF STEP WITH THE URGENCY OF THE MOMENT THAT WE ARE IN I'M AND IT TO ME ACTUALLY WAS EXEMPLIFIED WHEN YOU POINTED OUT THAT I YOU'VE NOW YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD ON I REQUEST- TO APPOINT A SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT FOR EACH LIKE. OFFICE AND THAT WAS A REQUEST THAT WE MADE OF YOUR- CAUGHT AGAIN EIGHT WELL. IN FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT A PROBABLY TOLD US NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SHARE GUIDANCE ABOUT THAT NEXT WEEK IN MID AUGUST. TO ME JUST EXEMPLIFIES HOW SLOWLY THINGS ARE MOVING AND- I'M REALLY CONCERNED- I'M I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I'VE HEARD SO FAR AND- I GUESS WOULD URGE WOULD WOULD YOU URGE YOU WOULD URGE US. TO EXPEDITE THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND RATHER THAN WAIT YOU KNOW MONTHS FOR. REPORTS AND MONTHS FOR ANALYSES ON WHETHER OR NOT IT DATA DASHBOARD MAKES SENSE TO ACTUALLY. MAKE SOLUTIONS HAPPEN NOW IN PROGRESS NOW HAVE. WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK TEACHER. WILL WAIT FOR MY TURN MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PORTION OF THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE I'VE YOU THIS THIS FAILURE AS PREDOMINANTLY IN I. T. FAILURE- IT'S HORRIFYING TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE SYSTEM STILL RUNNING AND COBALT. AND BY THE WAY I IN MY DAY I WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD PROGRAM AND I KNOW COBLE SO IF PUBLIC SERVICE DOESN'T WORK OUT FOR ME YOU SHOULD LOOK ME UP. SO I'M GRATIFIED TO HEAR THAT WE'VE GOT A STRIKE TEAM THAT'S GOING TO BE INVESTIGATING REPLACEMENT OF THAT SYSTEM. AND I'M SURE THAT THE INDUSTRY PARTNERS THAT YOU HAVE- THAT YOU HAVE ENGAGED. ARE GOING TO TELL YOU THAT- THE WAY TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS IS TO MAKE IT SO THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN FILE CLAIMS WITHOUT HAVING. ANY KIND OF PROBLEM AND THE ONES THAT DO HAVE PROBLEMS- ENABLE THEM TO SUBMIT THEIR DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY AND HAVE A AN AUTOMATED REVIEW PROCESS. TO MAKE IT SHOULD MAKE IT SO THAT A- HUMAN DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO GET INVOLVED. AND THAT'S HOW YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO STAFF ON HUGE CALL CENTERS. IF I JUST ENDING A SYSTEM IN. GET THE HOMES ALL WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO CALL. SO YOUR DOG GO AHEAD IF YOU'D LIKE. I WOULD HAVE TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE EXCITED THAT- WILL BE AWARDING A VENDOR IN OCTOBER FOR COMPLETE AND REPLACEMENT OF OUR SYSTEM. I KNOW WE'RE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THAT I HAVE A CONCERN THOUGH IN THE SHORTER TERM. BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED. CARE IS TO IS CURRENTLY BEING NEGOTIATED AND CONGRESS. AND I SHOULD THAT PASS IT IS LIKELY THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THOSE ENHANCED FEDERAL. THAT WILL BE MORE COMPLEX THAN IT HAS BEEN BEFORE SO IN OTHER WORDS INSTEAD OF JUST A FLAT AMOUNT PER WEEK IT'S LIKELY TO BE PERHAPS A PERCENTAGE. OF THE REPLACEMENT WAGES THAT THE CLAIMANT HAD EARNED AND I'M CONCERNED AND HERE'S MY QUESTION DOES OUR EXISTING SYSTEM HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO HANDLE THEY CALL FOR LIKE THAT AND WHAT KIND OF DIFFICULTY ARE WE GONNA HAVE SPENDING THAT UP. YES WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN- THEY REACHED OUT TO US ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ITERATIONS AND- HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE A- IT IT DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT THE PACKAGE INCLUDES. FROM ANY TIME MORTGAGE. HIGHER WAGES THAT IS VERY CHALLENGING- MATTER BETWEEN TWELVE THE TWENTY WEEK PROGRAMMING. SO IF I'M STANDING EVEN IF CONGRESS WERE TO ACTON EXTEND FEDERAL A SUPPLEMENTAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS SHOULD THAT TAKE THE STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IT TO TAKE US UP TO TWENTY WEEKS BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO START PROCESSING THOSE CLAIMS. YEAH ABSOLUTELY BEEN COMMUNICATING BACK THE NATIONAL LEVEL AS WELL AS FAR AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF. LABOR EVERYONE VERY AWARE OF IT AND WE'RE NOT THE OLY STATE IN THIS IN THIS SITUATION MANY MANY OTHER STATES HAVE ANTIQUATED SYSTEM BUT WELL. THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAS NOT SPENT MONEY ON MODERNIZATIONS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. SO THAT'S WHY SO MANY. A I AND INSTALLATION. IF I COULD DOWN ON THAT JUST FOR A MINUTE I'M IN STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULD BE THE CASE AND I'M NOT AN EXPERT I YOUR IT SYSTEMS BUT I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IF INFORMATION ON PAST CLIMATE HISTORY IN SALARY IS THERE IN THE SYSTEM AND WE'VE GOT ENGINEERS THAT ARE CODING A SPECIFIC SOLUTION TO THIS NEW FEDERAL STRUCTURE HOW COULD A TAKE US TWENTY WEEKS TO DEPLOY THAT. ALL OUR- HISTORY IS IN OUR OLD LEGACY SYSTEM IT'S NOT IN OUR MODERNIZE QUESTION- AND SECONDLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE DATA- WAGE DATA FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON P. WAY. WE DON'T OKAY PEEL AWAY THAT DOES THE FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT WHAT. ARE WHY DON'T WE HAVE THE WAY TO. AVOID OKAY. RIGHT OKAY WELL THAT THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IT'S NOT LINKED IN THE SYSTEM BOB OKAY WELL THE WE COULD TAKE A REST OF THIS DISCUSSION OFFLINE BUT THE SOMETHING I'M VERY CONCERNED IT SOUNDS LIKE. CONCERNED ABOUT TO. I THINK THAT. THE GOAL OF OUTRAGE THAT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY WOULD BE NOTHING COMPARED WITH. THE LEVEL OF OUTRAGE IF WE WERE TO TELL THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS GOING TO TAKE ALMOST HALF A YEAR TO PROCESS. THEIR FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SUPPLEMENT SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT- WE'RE GONNA DO IT TO THINK ABOUT. I AM JUST WE JUST ONE OTHER THING. BEFORE I A TIME THAT WORKS I JUST WANT TO MAKE. COMMENT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID EARLIER. ABOUT REALLY A WITH OUR- OFFICES AND I'D LIKE TO REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO VIEW US AS YOUR PARTNERS. THIS ENDEAVOR BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT MORE DIRECT. FACE TO FACE DAY TODAY CONTACT WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS THAN YOU DO. AND WE CAN BE KIND OF YOUR EYES AND EARS IN OUR DISTRICT CAN WILL WHEN WE- DO YOU. ARE ELEVATE IT TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S TO OUR ATTENTION. AND WE COULD BE HERE- FOR YOUR PARTNERS IN HELPING TO SOLVE ITSELF I HOPE YOU WILL VIEW THAT AS AN ADVERSE REAL RELATION. BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE CAN. BUT ALL YOUR- THE PARTNERSHIP AND I'M A WE WERE WITH THE STAFF EVERY DAY ALL AND IT'S BEEN A HAD BEEN A VERY GREAT PART AND WE HAVE BEEN A LAW THE LEADS ACROSS AND WE RELATIONS SO. PART MISSION IS AREA. THANK MISTER CHAIR OF. MS SO IT THERE IS THERE SEVERAL THAT I TO GO AND FIVE MINUTES ISN'T GOING TO BE ENOUGH SO FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT I AM A MY STAFF AND PREPARED BUT IT IS A QUESTIONS THAT I'D LIKE TO GET TO YOU. AND THE AND I APPRECIATE A TIMELY RESPONSE- TO ALL THE QUESTIONS AS WELL BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO POST THESE RESPONSES BACK ON MY WEBSITE SO THAT MY CONSTITUENTS CAN SEE- COULD GET A SENSE OF BOTH THE ENORMITY OF THE ISSUES AS WELL AS GIVEN THE PARENTS IN THE NATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY GET TO SEE HOW THE INNER WORKINGS OF GOVERNMENT ARE- SECOND AND I APPRECIATE SUPPORTING MR DATE MY COLLEAGUE MISTER ELISE BILL OF I. THIS CALL THAT AGAIN I THINK THIS WAS BROUGHT UP FOR A CHAIR CAN TO HOLD HEARINGS I'M HAPPY TO FLY UP OR DO IT THROUGH OF ANY TYPE OF A SECURE WEB SYSTEM OF MAYBE WE NEED TO HAVE THESE HEARINGS EVERY TWO WEEKS SIS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE CAN GET THERE FIRST YEAR BUT SEE IN OCCASION. TWO OF SO MISTER CHAIR I LEAVE THAT TO YOU I DO HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I WILL JUST ASK RIGHT NOW AT LEAST ARE HOW MANY EDT REPRESENTATIVES ARE WORKING THE PHONE LINES MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY EIGHTY AM TO TWELVE PM YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER. RIGHT NOW ON THAT LINE WE HAVE A HUNDRED. OUT OF A TOTAL WILL BE DIRECTED. AND THEN WE HAVE ALMOST ELEVEN HUNDRED ON THE OTHER LINE WITH ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED TO BE ADDED BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. AND ARE FULLY TRAINED. SO A HUNDRED PEOPLE BETWEEN EIGHT AM TO TWELVE PM WE'RE TAKING ALL THE GENERAL CALLS. AND THEN SEVEN HUNDRED THAT ARE FROM EIGHT AM TO EIGHT PM. ONCE A WEEK RIGHT ONCE THAT'S THAT'S A ONCE A WEEK PROGRAM. CORRECT SO FROM A WELL WE HAVE A HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVE RIGHT FROM- EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK BY THE END OF THIS WEEK WILL HAVE. AND. ELEVEN WELL I A COUPLE. BUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW I THINK THIS IS THERE IS ASKING NOT NEXT WEEK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF HUNDRED AND BY THE END OF THE WEEK WILL HAVE- PLUS THERE'S- EIGHT. YEAH AND THAT'S FIVE DAYS A WEEK I THOUGHT THE PROGRAM WAS ONLY ONE DAY. SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. OKAY WHAT'S THE AVERAGE TIME- PER CALL. FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ANSWERING CALLS BETWEEN EIGHT AM TO TWELVE PM AND INDIVIDUALS ANSWERING CALLS BETWEEN EIGHT AM TO EIGHT PM. ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN MINUTES. FOR WHICH ONE. BOTH FOR BOTH ONE IS TECHNICAL THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T THINK SO TECHNICAL SO WHICH ONE TO EXPAND. PEOPLE CALL ALL THE DIFFERENT LINE SO EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE HER CREDIT SEGREGATE WHICH LINE- OUR CUSTOMER DO BOTH OF THEM ENTERTAINED CHANGER BILLY. SO IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE AND THEY CALL IT THE SAME SERVICES BEING OFFERED AND- THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME.OKAY SO TELL ME THIS ON A DAILY BASIS RIGHT NOW HOW MANYPEOPLE REPORT TO WORK AT EDT. RIGHT NOW. LET ME RIGHT YEAH ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND. EXCEPT BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE TODAY REPORT TO WORK AND OF THAT. A HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE ON THE PHONES. IN THE MORNINGS. BETWEEN EIGHT TO TWELVE AND THEN CURRENTLY SEVEN HUNDRED ARE ON ANOTHER SET OF PHONE LINES. THIS ACCURATE. MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ARE WORK MORE SERVICES PROGRAM ARE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM ARE TAX PROGRAM AND ON A POINT WHERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THOSE PROGRAMS THIS UNEMPLOYMENT WE- WELL PEOPLE. I UNDERSTAND THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALSO AT A TIME WHERE MORE PEOPLE NEED TO BE DEPLOYED ONTO THESE PHONE LINES IN ORDER TO CALM AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES. YOU HAVE US YOU'VE HAD A- YEAH. AND THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING EVERY DAY WE HAVE PEOPLE ROLLING OUT OF TRAINING EVERY DAY INTO A CALL CENTER. SO DOES IT. THANK YOU OUT OF THE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT THOUSAND EMPLOYEES EDT HAS TODAY. HOW MANY OF THEM ARE NEW HIRES WITHIN THE LAST THREE MONTHS FOUR MONTHS. OR MOVED SINCE MARCH. UP MARCH ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND YOU'RE GONNA BE HIRING ANOTHER FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED OR YOU HAVE APPROVAL. HELP ME OUT.

TO HELP ME THEY WERE HAVING PEOPLE START INTO OUR TRAINING SESSION. NINE BUT SO THERE GONNA BE FOUR THOUSAND SOME HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE EGGS EXISTING EIGHT THOUSAND. SAID ACCURATE OTHER OTHER FIFTY THREE HUNDRED. FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED ARE APPROVED TO HIGHER SO THEY- WERE READY TO BRING THEM ON AND- GET THEM GOING SO THAT WE- BROUGHT ON ABOUT TWO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. AND THE RAM DOOR FIGURE OUT THERE START DATE THINKING AMENDED TRAINING. SO OF THE FIFTY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ALREADY ON BOARD WHICH MEANS ANOTHER TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED YOUR YOUR EMPLOYEE BASE SHOULD BE EXPANDING BY ANOTHER TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED. CORRECT. YEAH CORRECT OKAY I'M TRYING TO THE DIRECTION BECAUSE WE ARE LOSING PEOPLE EVERY DAY AS WELL THANK YOU SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO PACIFIC NUMBERS BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT WE CAN RELY ON. DATA IS THE ONLY THING THAT WE CAN RELY ON AND I'VE BEEN PART OF THIS COMMITTEE. FOR EIGHT YEARS NOW I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF ALSO SERVING AS CHAIR IN FACT YOU'VE HAD YOU HAVE THREE CHAIRS WHO BETWEEN MR DALY MYSELF AND THE CURRENT CHAIR. I GOTTA SAY IT. TAKES ME TO NO END WHEN WE'VE AT QUESTION IS YEARS AND WE'VE GOTTEN. OF NOT TO RISK SAYS. AN THOSE WOULD THE GOOD TIMES DURING THE TIMES WHERE WE ASSUMEDLY HER LEARNED FROM OUR MISTAKES DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WE HAD A ELEVEN YEAR PERIOD TO RECOVER AND MAKE THE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS TO MAKE THE CHANGES NECESSARY SO THAT WE WOULD NOT. THIS AT. BEEN YOU'VE BEEN. PART OF THIS YOU ARE THIS INSTITUTION YOU'VE HAD A CAREER FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS WITH THIS INSTITUTION IF ANYONE KNOWS THE DETAILS OF HOW TO RECONSTRUCT WHERE THE FAULTS ARE WHERE THE ISSUES ARE. HOW TO MANEUVER CHANGE EFFECTIVE CHANGE WITH APPROPRIATE INCISION NOT JUST TAKE A SLEDGE HAMMER BUT WITH THE APPROPRIATE INCISION IT'S YOU. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN THIS FALL THE CHAMPION OVER- BENEFIT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT THAT WERE- GOING TO BE- IN OCTOBER AWARDING A VENDOR BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE THAT THE- THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS WITH. THE WHOLE TIME YOUR WIFE SYSTEM THAT ARE MEANT IS MISTER LANGUAGE THE SELLER WITH GREAT LEVEL OF RESPECT I WOULD NEVER FIGHT WAS IN YOUR MISSION I NEVER USE THE WORD CHAMPION. BECAUSE THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE FOR EDT RIGHT NOW. I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW FRONT BUT I AM THAT YEAH JUST. TO YOUR IN YOUR COMMENT SAID NINETY. WHEN MIL. THREE BECAUSE- TOTALING FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. JUST A LETTER. ISSUED YESTERDAY JULY TWENTY NINTH YOU SAY. BETWEEN MARCH EIGHTH AND JULY EIGHTEENTH WE PROCESS EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION CLAIMS AND DISTRIBUTED FORTY FORTY NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS I'M NOT TRYING TO. I'M NOT TRYING TO BE TO BE THAT THAT- BUT WITHIN A DAY. YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER DATA THAT REFLECTED SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW ABSURD THAT. ABOUT EVERY THIRD DAY MA'AM DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW ABSURD THAT SOUNDS TO ALL OF US THOUGH. THAT WEEKLY DATA COMES OUT EVERY THIRD DAY. MAYBE YOU THINK BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR TO ISSUE WEEKLY STATISTICS WHICH WE DO. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT DO YOU SEE HOW BAD IT LOOKS WHEN YOU'RE PRODUCING NUMBERS. THAT ARE DIFFERENT BY A HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WITHIN A DAY. TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD SAW YOU SIT ST AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HEARING NINE POINT THREE MILLION CLAIMS WERE TOTALING FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND YESTERDAY'S LETTER SUGGESTS THAT. POINT SEVEN BILLION CLAIM TOTALING FORTY NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. POINT IN TIME FOR PAYING OUT BENEFITS EVERY MOMENT SO IT'S JUST A POINT OF TIME BUT THE OFFICIAL NUMBERS ARE WHAT WE PUBLIC. EVERY THURSDAY. I WOULD JUST VERY MUCH OF. I WOULD KINDLY ASK THAT OR CHAIR DOES CONSIDER HAVING THESE HEARINGS WITH YOU AND WITH THE TOP EXECUTIVE LEVEL INDIVIDUALS. EIGHT EIGHT IF POSSIBLE TO WEEK BASIS SO THAT WE CAN GET CLARITY AND CONTINUOUS NUMBERS SO THAT WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE- HAVING THESE HEARINGS ON A- SIX MONTH BASIS JUST DOES NOT MEAN MUCH THERE'S- UNFORTUNATELY THAT WOULD THAT'S WHAT LENDS ITSELF. FOR US TO GET DIFFERENT SETS OF NUMBERS AND BE LOST IN THE ENORMITY OF ALL OF THIS THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT. I WANT TO SEE CLARITY I DO AGREE TRANSPARENCY IN COMMUNICATION SO I LOOK FORWARD TO A MUCH MORE ROBUST AND A QUICK FREQUENCY BASED BUT COMMUNITY. YOU MEMBERS. WHICH LACKEY. YES THANK YOU- IT SEEMS LIKE SINCE OUR OUR OUR MEETING IN MAY THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT MORE THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US. OUR CONFIDENCE IN DD I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT.

HAVING THEIR LAST SERVING OF RAMAN LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WE LIVE WITH. AND SO THE IF IT THAT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATION IT'S BEEN THAT THIS SERVER REAL TO SIGN UP IT SEEMS LIKE. MAYBE IT. UBER TO MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO- ARE IN YOUR CIRCLE BUT LET ME JUST ASK YOU FIRST OF ALL- FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY BENEFITS WILL THEY STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVEN ALL THAT SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE MONTH. LA IS. FOUND ELIGIBLE- ANY PAYMENT THAT WAS DUE- DURING THE TIME IT WAS ELIGIBLE THEY WILL GET THAT MONEY. SO THEY WILL NOT BE HARMED IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY WHAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FILE AND OTHER CLAIM PROCESS. FINALLY OKAY THANK YOU- MY OFFICE HAS NEARLY A TWO HUNDRED UNRESOLVED DDD CLAIMS THAT WERE ASSISTING- WITH WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND SOME DATING BACK TO SPRING AND I MENTIONED LAST TIME THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CHAT QUICKLY SO PROP WE'RE EXTREMELY WITH OUR THE HANG. I HASN'T BEEN ANY EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AT ALL- OF BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL HAPPENING. SO I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY THE PACIFIC IF YOU WANT TO SEND ME IF THERE'S A SPECIFIC ISSUE WE CAN LOOK INTO IT- BUT IN GENERAL I THINK YOU KNOW WE TALK TO. WE'VE BEEN PLAYING. WE'RE GOING TO. A ENGINEER AND DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE DEPLOYING. AGAIN WHEN THE STRIKE FORCE COMES THE STRIKE TEAM. I THINK WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL WILL BE RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING THAT WE LOOKED AT AND SEE IF THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITIES AT. A LATER TIME. I CERTAINLY HOPE TO SPUR FORCE.

THEY SHOULD CALL THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS HELP OF THEIR CLAIM WE LOVE BEING A PART. BUT NOT PART OF THE INSTRUCTION PROCESS. FIVE I'M SORRY THAT HAVE HAPPENED OUT CLEAR A COUPLE TIMES WITH THEIR STAFF MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE AT THAT NOT OUR POLICY. OKAY THIS WILL TALK ABOUT THE STRIKE FORCE BEING OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME GOOD RESULTS FORTY FIVE DAYS FROM NOW BUT YET THAT TAKES SIX MONTHS INTO IT BUSINESSES IN EARLIER YOU IN THEIR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS WHAT COULD TRY FORCED YOU SHOULD KNOW ALREADY.

ON DIALOGUE WITH OFFICES IN YOUR OFFICE HAVE IMPROVED BUT THEY'RE STILL A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS THAT CONTINUED TO. AND OUT THERE I WOULD JUST REITERATE FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR WHO MENTIONED THIS TECHNOLOGY ISSUE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY ISSUE WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE- IS THAT OUR OFFICE CONTINUES TO. WHICH IS. IN THAT WE HAVE A DUAL SYSTEM FOR SUBMITTING DOCUMENTATION WE HAVE A DIGITAL SYSTEM FOR VERY FIND THE IMITATION.OR IS THAT MANY OF THE- OLDER BACKLOG CASES EXTENDS BACK TO THE ABILITY TO. VERIFY IDENTIFICATION TO VERIFY DOCUMENTS SO WITH THE STRIKE TEAM COMING IN OCTOBER. I GUESS WINDY AND HIS A. B. YOU.

THERE ARE LINES OF DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE IN FRONT OF THOSE OFFICES MATTER IN HELL THAT THE LITTLE ECURITY GUARD WON'T LET THEM ANYWHERE NEAR THE BUILDING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET INTO ANY DD OFFICE WITHOUT A PHONE APPOINTMENT. THE CATCH TWENTY TWO IS YOU CAN'T GET THEM ON THE PHONE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. NOW IN MY CASE. THE ACTOR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK FOR SIXTEEN WEEKS COME TO ABOUT NINETY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THE VALUE MY EDT CLIMB IS EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS IS NOT CHUMP CHANGE. I AM CURRENTLY SUFFERING BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO HAVE A LITTLE MONEY I HAVE SOME SECOND GAVE THE TRUST THEY DON'T WANNA LET ME FOR CLOSE. BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE. WHERE'S MY PAYMENT MIKE MY CURRENT THE OTHER. SIX MONTHS BEHIND RIGHT NOW. THE NOTE IS DUE IN THE TWENTY FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER. WELL VERY UNLIKELY THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING TO PAY ARE THEY STILL GOING TO. KEEP ME FROM GETTING MY MONEY. I HAVE SPENT FIVE WEEKS WITH KEVIN MCCARTY IS OFFICE. ROBIN AND LAUREN AND I NORMAL BY NAME AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAS AGREED WITH ME THAT THIS IS BEYOND THE PALE. THIS IS SO FAR BEYOND THE PALE. THAT I'M LOOKING TO PROPERTY OUT OF STATE I'M A NATIVE CALIFORNIAN. THIS IS NOT MY STATE ANYMORE. THEY'RE MORE WORRIED ABUT PAN PLAYING POLITICS WITH THIS MONEY. THIS IS KERR'S MONEY THIS IS MONEY THAT CAME FROM THE US GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE IS HOLDING IT BACK. THIS MONEY IS DESIGNED TO GO INTO THE ECONOMY. I CAN'T SPEND IT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE IT. I DON'T HAVE IT BECAUSE HE DID TELLS ME THAT MY BIRTHDAY IS NOT MY BIRTHDAY. I'VE SURPRISED I SUPPLIED. A PASSPORT I CALIFORNIA REAL ID MY SOCIAL SECURITY CARD YEAH MY MEDICARE CARD. AND TODAY THEY HAD THE AUDACITY AFTER SEVENTY FOUR DAYS TO TELL ME THAT THERE WOULD BE FURTHER DELAYS UNTIL I FAXED THEM WHICH I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT HAS A FAX MACHINE ANYMORE FAX THEM A COPY OF MY UTILITY BILL. NOW WHY THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHO I AM OR WHAT MY BIRTHDAY IS I HAVE NO IDEA. BUT LESS THAN TWO HOURS AGO I GOT A CALL BACK. SAYING WELL. THEY COULD SEE THEIR WAY CLEAR TO CHANGE MY BIRTHDAY TO THE PROPER BIRTHDAY. THE WOMAN THAT TESTIFIED THIS HARDING CHARACTER. I THOUGHT I WAS WATCHING DANCING WITH THE POLITICAL STARS. SHE DIDN'T GIVE YOU A STRAIGHT ANSWER OUT OF ANYTHING. TO TELL YOU FLAT OUT IN A BOLD FACED LIE. THAT THEY'RE NOT REFERRING PEOPLE TO OUR REPRESENTATIVES. SHE SHOULD BE HELD ON PERJURY CHARGES. THIS IS BEYOND THE PALE WHAT I LISTEN TO FOR TWO HOURS HERE AN OUT OF STATE FOR THE REST OF HAD TO GRAB GO MOVE MY CAR. BUT IT JUST BEYOND THE PALE. WHERE SOMEONE IS SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD LIVED HIS ENTIRE LIFE HERE THE ENTIRE CAREER AND SAT IN CALIFORNIA TO PUT UP WITH THIS AND BE TOLD THAT MY BIRTHDAY IS NOT MY BIRTHDAY BECAUSE THEIR RECORD YOUR BAD EVEN THOUGH FOR DOCUMENTS. FROM THE GOVERNMENT. SAYS MY BIRTHDAY'S MY BIRTHDAY. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. IT WILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT- ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR TO. THANK YOU BOB LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING ALL THE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES AND KNOW THAT WE ARE HEARING YOUR SAME EXPERIENCES EVERYDAY IN EVERY SINGLE OFFICE. TIMES MANY MANY MANY TIMES FOLD SO THANK YOU FOR SHARON LET ME- I HAVE A COUPLE POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE AROUND CUSTOMER SERVICE AND A FEW QUESTIONS TO- DIRECTOR HILLIARD ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. I WAS ASTONISHED WHEN THE DIRECTOR RESPONDED TO MISTER LACKEYS PRIOR QUESTION AROUND HANG UPS AND SAYING SHE HAD NOT HEARD ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU HEARD SO MANY INDIVIDUALS TODAY TALK ABOUT IT. AND IT IS SO CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT CERTAIN STAFF MAYBE DOING AND WE KNOW THERE A LOT OF STAFF THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT HERE NOT HANG UPS EVERY DAY THE WEEK AND IN. CENTER OPERATIONS YOU HAVE PLANE TICKET NUMBERS OR- AS WE ARE HERE WHEN WE CALL THESE CALL CENTERS QUOTE THIS CALL MAYBE RECORDED FOR QUALITY ASSURE. I WANT TO. THANK FOR. LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE- THE BTD HAS TROUBLE IT WILL FULLY BLIND I TO THIS. SECOND ONE SAYS TO RUN. THE FACT THAT ET DE HAS FORCED TO CALL HUNDREDS OF TIMES WITHOUT BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IT'SUNFATHOMABLE FRUSTRATING. WHEN MOST PEOPLE CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH OTHER TYPICAL CALL CENTERS THERE'S GENERALLY FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AUTOMATIC CALLBACKS IT'LL CALL US BACK IN HALF AN HOUR SIX HOURS AGAIN WE WANT TO HAS TO STRIKE FORCE TO LOOK INTO BASIC. CALLBACK TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE DELOITTE COMIC CENTER THIRD THING I WANT TO ASK- WE HEARD THAT- THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS A DASHBOARD WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW INFORMATION ABOUT THAT DASHBOARD AND HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DASHBOARD. TO WITH A SENSE- IF I COULD JUST RECTOR HILLIARD. HOW MANY CALLS WERE RECEIVED BY HOW MANY UNIQUE CALLERS THIS PAST MONTH. IT'S DR HOWARD ONLINE. YES I'M HERE- WHAT I REALLY ATTRACTED BY WEEKLY IS TO- AROUND- BETWEEN WEEK. FIVE DOLLARS HE CALLS AND HOW MANY HOLES WERE MADE DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. THREE PRIVACY ALLOWED MILLION A WEEK SEOUL LEVIN MILLION CALLS A WEEK AND ONLY FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED UNIQUE COLORS ABLE TO GET THROUGH THAT IS ASTONISHING WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT AUTOMATIC CALL BACKS OR THINKING OF HOW TO GET SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND HANG UPS AS A WAY. TO DO THAT- I KNOW OUR- MISS PETRIE-NORRIS HAD ASKED A COUPLE QUESTIONS AROUND THE BERRIES CALL CENTERS AND- UP. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE VERY VERY FOCUSED IN FACT THAT ONE CALL CENTERS WHERE YOU CAN. ADDRESS CLAIMS IS ONLY OPEN FOUR HOURS A DAY. YOU HAVE THE OTHER CALL CENTER THE DELIGHT CALL CENTER MY UNDERSTANDING IS STAFFER PAID FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. TO ANSWER GENERAL QUESTIONS THE STAFF CAN ONLY ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS AND MAKE VERY MINE. TECHNICAL MINISTRY CHANGES TO ACCESS YOU ACCOUNT AND IF I DO THE MATH. FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR TIMES FORTY HOURS A WEEK TIMES FIFTY WEEKS A YEAR IF THAT'S HOW PLAYS OUT. UNDER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT PER LANE GENERAL INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY IN A WEBSITE IS WORTH THAT. AND WE'VE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON WHETHER. THAT AGREEMENT WITH THE LIGHT IS REALLY WORKING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WANTED I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION OF HOW SHIP THOSE PERSONNEL. FROM ANSWERING GENERAL QUESTIONS TO ACTUALLY ANSWERING QUESTIONS AROUND SPECIFIC CLAIMS. YES WE HAVE BEEN KILLING BOTH OF THE LAWYERS AND THE ETV STAFF OR THE COMBINATION OF PEOPLE ARE ON THAT LINE- WE PROVIDE ONGOING TRAINING AND THEIR LATE WE HAVE ENHANCED HER ACCESS TO DRAFT THE SEPTIC. CLAIM ISSUES- SO I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING THAT THE MOST DEFINITELY. OKAY BUT WE STILL HAVE FOLKS FOR BEING PAID AT THAT EVEL TO- ON THE ON THE GENERAL LINE. THE GENERAL LINE IS THAT I MEAN% IT PROVIDES A WHOLE ARRAY OF SERVICES IT'S- ADVOCATE AND IT DOES GET INTO CLAIMS SPECIFICS FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE THE CAL. I THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY LYING TO US AGAIN BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS NOR IS THAT ACTUALLY WHAT IT EVEN SAYS I THINK ON YOUR WEBSITE SO- AGAIN NOT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT IT'S SUPER FRUSTRATING THAT THIS IS HARD TO. TO WORK THROUGH LET ME UP I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AROUND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DDT AND DELIGHT SO YOU'RE VERY WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT. WHEN EDT SYSTEMS FELL TEN YEARS AGO ET HIGHER DELIGHT FOR YOUR PROJECT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO COST FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT PROJECT MASSIVELY FAILED CREATED MASSIVE DELAYS IN PAIN UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ACCORDING TO A CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE REPORT FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THAT CONTRACT WENT FROM A FOUR YEAR FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT. TO ASSIST HERE NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT AND STATE AUDITOR'S AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND MASSIVE MISREPRESENTATIONS OF PROGRESS ON ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF DEFECT INVOLVING THAT RELATIONSHIP NOW. I UNDERSTAND LLOYD CONTINUES TO BE A VENDOR OF YOURS OUR OFFICES ACTUALLY MET WITH THE LIGHT A FEW TIMES THE RESPONSES WE HEAR FROM THEM. IS THEY CLAIMED RESPONSE OR- TAKEN. WITH HER ONE DAY SYSTEMS. THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT AT FAULT FOR ITS HAPPENING THEY DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO FIX THINGS. GIVEN HOW MUCH YOU PAY THEM. I WANT TO ASK YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY ACTUALLY DO. COUPLE YES OR NO QUESTIONS SO DELIGHT BUILT AND MAINTAINS THE YOU WHY ON MY PORTAL SYSTEM RIGHT. AB THEY MAINTAIN THAT WE IS LLOYD SERVICES TO IT THAT. RIGHT YEAH OKAY AND I KNOW ET DE SUPPOSE IT OWNS THE DATA BUT IF YOU DID A NEEDS TO RUN DATA QUERIES AND PULL DATA FROM THE U. I. ONLINE PORTAL DELIGHT STAFF HAS TO HELP YOU RUN THAT DID IT RIGHT.

THEY'RE NOT IN CHARGE OF IT THEY DO IT IN JOE AND PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR AYE HE STAFF IN OUR PROGRAM STAFF AS A- AS A- IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING ALL ASPECTS OF THE- ANY PROJECT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. YEAH WELL YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE ALL OF THE ANSWERS THAT YOU JUST PROVIDED TO ME. ARE CONTRADICTORY TO WHAT THE LORD HAS TOLD US. SODALITE IS TELLING US THAT ANYTHING THAT'S BROKEN IS YOUR FULL. AND THEY'VE ABDICATED RESPONSIBILITY. AND THEY HAVE GIVEN US ANSWERS WHICH ARE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE HAVE JUST. WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU NOT JUST DISCUSSED AND YOU KEEP SIGNING NEW CONTRACTS WITH THE LIGHT FACT THIS YEAR YOU ENTERED INTO I THINK A SECOND NO BID CONTRACT. WITH THE WHITE. A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AS WELL AS FROM THE MEDIA WHO'VE BEEN ASKING WHY DO WE KEEP ENTERING. INTO NO BIG CONTRACTS WITH SOMEONE. THAT HAS SUCH A LONG HISTORY OF COST OVERRUNS AND PROBLEMATIC I. T. WORK. MALES ONE FINAL QUESTION TO YOU YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE STATE HAS SPENT WITH THE LAWYER.
