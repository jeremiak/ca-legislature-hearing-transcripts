00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:42.540 region:rollup2
OF THINGS. THAT CREATES AB.

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:44.175 region:rollup2
INSTABILITY IN OUR POPULATION

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.211 region:rollup2
INVECTIVE THAT MEASURE IF THAT

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:47.479 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION IS ULTIMATELY PASSED

00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:49.047 region:rollup2
IT WILL WIPE OUT ALL OF THE

00:35:47.479 --> 00:35:51.216 region:rollup2
SAVINGS FOR PROP FIFTY SEVEN

00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:53.051 region:rollup2
THAT. ALMOST ALL OF THE SAVINGS

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:54.619 region:rollup2
THAT WE PROJECT FOR.

00:35:53.051 --> 00:35:56.287 region:rollup2
PROP FIFTY SEVEN.

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:57.822 region:rollup2
JUNE SO THE.

00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:59.791 region:rollup2
LA JOH IN G. O. F. PRELIMINARY

00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:00.925 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF THAT INITIATIVE SAID

00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:02.727 region:rollup2
IT WOULD IMPACT ABOUT A THOUSAND

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:04.262 region:rollup2
INMATES AND COST TENS OF

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:05.997 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO GET

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:07.766 region:rollup2
DEEPER ANALYSIS A REAL LEGAL

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:10.368 region:rollup2
THEORY IS THAT IT WILL IMPACT

00:36:07.766 --> 00:36:11.936 region:rollup2
NINE UP TO NINE THOUSAND INMATES

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:14.005 region:rollup2
AND COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF

00:36:11.936 --> 00:36:15.173 region:rollup2
DOLLARS MORE TOWARDS THE HUNDRED

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:16.875 region:rollup2
OF.

00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:18.476 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS ACTUALLY NAY

00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:20.078 region:rollup2
AND IT WILL AGAIN REDUCE ALL OF

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:20.712 region:rollup2
THE SAVINGS THAT WE WORK SO HARD

00:36:20.078 --> 00:36:22.747 region:rollup2
TO.

00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:25.417 region:rollup2
OBTAIN SO FOR ALL OF THOSE

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:26.985 region:rollup2
REASONS TO THINK THAT WE COULD

00:36:25.417 --> 00:36:27.285 region:rollup2
CLOSE CRC.

00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:29.521 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST.

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:31.022 region:rollup2
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND

00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:31.723 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT CRC.

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:33.525 region:rollup2
IS.

00:36:31.723 --> 00:36:35.193 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THE STAFF AT THAT SYSTEM

00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:37.128 region:rollup2
AT AT THAT PRISON AND WORK VERY

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:39.064 region:rollup2
HARD TO KEEP THAT I'M VERY OLD

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:40.565 region:rollup2
PRISON TOGETHER. BUT OUR

00:36:39.064 --> 00:36:43.802 region:rollup2
POPULATION JUST DOES NOT ALLOW

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:45.103 region:rollup2
US TO CLOSE ICRC AT THIS POINT.

00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:46.671 region:rollup2
I'D ALSO LIKE TO TURN TO.

00:36:45.103 --> 00:36:48.139 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE MOST OF OUR

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:49.841 region:rollup2
BUDGET REQUESTS ARE A LOT OF OUR

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:51.676 region:rollup2
BUDGET REQUESTS IS RELATED TO

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:53.745 region:rollup2
JUST BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:54.212 region:rollup2
RANGE THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR WE

00:36:53.745 --> 00:36:55.980 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:57.048 region:rollup2
HAD TERRIBLE.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.918 region:rollup2
FLOODING AND.

00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:01.519 region:rollup2
ROOF DAMAGE ACROSS OUR SYSTEM

00:36:59.918 --> 00:37:02.387 region:rollup2
AND SO THE BUDGET REQUEST THAT

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:05.056 region:rollup2
YOU THAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT.

00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:06.825 region:rollup2
TODAY IN AND IN FUTURE SESSIONS

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:08.626 region:rollup2
IS RELATED TO US TRYING TO GET A

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:10.028 region:rollup2
HOLD OF THEM FIXING THE ROADS

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:12.097 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT.

00:37:10.028 --> 00:37:14.733 region:rollup2
TO THAT I HAVE ATTACHMENTS FOR

00:37:12.097 --> 00:37:17.001 region:rollup2
YOU ATTACHED A LETTER FROM THE.

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:18.036 region:rollup2
PRISON LAW OFFICE THAT TOOK ON

00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:19.304 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:21.072 region:rollup2
THOSE PICTURES WHICH YOU WILL

00:37:19.304 --> 00:37:23.742 region:rollup2
SEE IS A MADE SLEEPING WITH

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:24.209 region:rollup2
PLASTIC BAGS OVER THE. LIGHTING

00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:25.777 region:rollup2
FIXTURES

00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:27.045 region:rollup2
KEEP THE WATER OFF THEIR BED

00:37:25.777 --> 00:37:29.013 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN IN TALL A TOLERABLE

00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:29.214 region:rollup2
SITUATION IN MY MIND AND IT'S

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:31.282 region:rollup2
JUST.

00:37:29.214 --> 00:37:33.251 region:rollup2
NOT PROVIDING A BASIC HUMAN

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:35.587 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE A LIVABLE

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:37.422 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT SO THOSE UNADDRESSED

00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:39.524 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES ARMS WILL

00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:40.825 region:rollup2
KICK NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. ARM

00:37:39.524 --> 00:37:41.926 region:rollup2
IN WALL THIS BUDGET REQUEST

00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:43.762 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SOLVE ALL OF OUR

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:46.464 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THE INVESTMENT IN OUR

00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:47.532 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE REQUIRED

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:48.967 region:rollup2
IN FUTURE BUDGETS.

00:37:47.532 --> 00:37:50.969 region:rollup2
THE ONE TIME COSTS THAT YOU WILL

00:37:48.967 --> 00:37:51.536 region:rollup2
HEAR ABOUT IS RELATED TO FIRST

00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:53.438 region:rollup2
RESPONDER.

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:55.106 region:rollup2
FIRST RESPONDER KIND OF

00:37:53.438 --> 00:37:57.041 region:rollup2

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.842 region:rollup2
RADIO SYSTEM IN HEALTH CARE

00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:59.110 region:rollup2
VEHICLE SO THAT WE COULD TAKE

00:37:57.842 --> 00:38:00.979 region:rollup2
OUR. OUR INMATES.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:02.147 region:rollup2
TO THEIR MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS

00:38:00.979 --> 00:38:03.715 region:rollup2
AND SUCH.

00:38:02.147 --> 00:38:05.150 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BIG PART OF OUR REFORM

00:38:03.715 --> 00:38:07.418 region:rollup2
IS IN MADE EMPLOYMENT.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:09.854 region:rollup2
I THINK A VERY COMMON SENSE.

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:11.856 region:rollup2
POINTS AND I'VE HEARD IT FROM

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:13.758 region:rollup2
AND OUR OUR PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:15.827 region:rollup2
IS THAT A LIVABLE WAGE IS KEY TO

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:16.828 region:rollup2
REDUCE RECIDIVISM. UMP SO WE'VE

00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:18.429 region:rollup2
BEEN PARTNERING WITH THE

00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:20.031 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ANY TO GET

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:22.400 region:rollup2
JUSTICE INVOLVED.

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:23.701 region:rollup2
FOLKS AS INTO THE STATEWIDE

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.537 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT PLAN INCREASED

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:26.671 region:rollup2
COORDINATION WITH THE TRAITS

00:38:25.537 --> 00:38:27.605 region:rollup2
IMPACT THE PRISON INDUSTRY

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:30.141 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY.

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:31.309 region:rollup2
AYE IS PROVIDING TOOLS AND

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:32.477 region:rollup2
UNION DUES FOR MEMBERS ONCE THEY

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:34.379 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAM SO THAT

00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:36.080 region:rollup2
WHEN AN OFFENDER GETS OUT THAT

00:38:34.379 --> 00:38:39.217 region:rollup2
CAN GO TO THE UNION ALL HAVE A.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.885 region:rollup2
A LIFETIME. EMPLOYMENT.

00:38:39.217 --> 00:38:42.687 region:rollup2

SERVICE JOBS WE'RE ACTUALLY

00:38:45.023 --> 00:38:48.693 region:rollup2
HAVING INMATES APPLYING WHILE

00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:49.794 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN PRISON TO GO WORK FOR

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:50.228 region:rollup2
CALTRANS WOULD UGS.

ALL.

00:38:50.228 --> 00:38:54.132 region:rollup2
ALT KEY TO.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.767 region:rollup2
CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT THAT I

00:38:54.132 --> 00:38:57.035 region:rollup2
THINK PROP FIFTY SEVEN HAS HAS

00:38:55.767 --> 00:38:58.836 region:rollup2
GIVEN US TO CHANGE HOW WE

00:38:57.035 --> 00:39:00.305 region:rollup2
INCARCERATE IN THE STATE ONE OF

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:02.540 region:rollup2
OUR BUDGET PROPOSALS.

00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:03.975 region:rollup2
INVOLVES. TAKING A PAROLE

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.144 region:rollup2
PAROLE  <u><c.green>CAMP IS YOU KNOW WE</c></u>

00:39:03.975 --> 00:39:07.879 region:rollup2
HAVE A ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:08.746 region:rollup2
INMATES HAVE FIGHT FIRES ACROSS

00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:09.814 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEM.

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:11.449 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WHO WROTE

00:39:09.814 --> 00:39:12.817 region:rollup2
CONVECTIVE LOST A COUPLE OF

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:14.619 region:rollup2
THOSE FIREFIGHTERS.

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:16.187 region:rollup2
AS THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING THE

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:17.622 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS WORK THAT THEY DO.

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:20.458 region:rollup2
VALLEY ALWAYS RECOMMENDED.

00:39:17.622 --> 00:39:21.426 region:rollup2
AGAINST THAT PROPOSAL AND THAT

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.727 region:rollup2
IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THE

00:39:21.426 --> 00:39:23.695 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO CREATE IN

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:26.264 region:rollup2
THIS IS SIMPLY THAT.

00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:27.332 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS THAT SPEND THEIR LIFE

00:39:26.264 --> 00:39:28.766 region:rollup2
IN OUR HOME

00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:30.301 region:rollup2
AS SPEND THEIR CAR SERRATION ARE

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:32.203 region:rollup2
WORKING IN OUR FIRE CAMPS IN

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:33.872 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT SKILLS. ON YOU WANT

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:34.539 region:rollup2
TO GOING TO THE FIRE TRADE WHEN

00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:36.808 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DONE.

00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:38.776 region:rollup2
AND IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO TRY

00:39:36.808 --> 00:39:40.578 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE A VEHICLE IN WHILE

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:41.412 region:rollup2
THAT THE ALLEY ALWAYS SUGGESTED

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:43.314 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S BECAUSE IT WON'T

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:44.616 region:rollup2
REDUCE RECIDIVISM I THINK THAT

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:46.384 region:rollup2
UNDERMINES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:39:44.616 --> 00:39:47.619 region:rollup2
DO IN OUR SYSTEM. OF TRYING TO

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:50.555 region:rollup2
PROVIDE AVENUES FOR THESE

00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:50.755 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE MEANINGFUL

00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:51.656 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:53.591 region:rollup2
.

00:39:51.656 --> 00:39:55.326 region:rollup2
SO I I I JUST SAY THAT I THINK

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:56.995 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE REJECTION OF THE

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:58.930 region:rollup2
FIRE CAMPUS AND OTHER BAD

00:39:56.995 --> 00:40:00.298 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION BY THE LA NO.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.899 region:rollup2
IN OTHER PROPOSALS TO TAKE

00:40:00.298 --> 00:40:04.269 region:rollup2
SEVENTY SIX YOU.

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:05.136 region:rollup2
IN HOUSE IN OUR G. DJJ FACILITY

00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:07.272 region:rollup2
THAT WERE CONVICTED IN ADULT

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:08.740 region:rollup2
COURT COMMITTED CRIMES BEFORE

00:40:07.272 --> 00:40:10.108 region:rollup2
THEY'RE EIGHTEEN BERNIE BIRTHDAY

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.476 region:rollup2
WHERE ADJUDICATED BETWEEN

00:40:10.108 --> 00:40:13.978 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE.

00:40:11.476 --> 00:40:15.246 region:rollup2
INCOMPLETE THEIR SENTENCE BEFORE

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:17.548 region:rollup2
THEIR TWENTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY.

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:19.517 region:rollup2
ADULT PRISONS EAT UP YOUNGER

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:20.919 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS IN SO KEEPING

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:22.687 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS IN DJJ I.

00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:24.222 region:rollup2
OF FOR A GREATER PEER TIME

00:40:22.687 --> 00:40:26.124 region:rollup2
BETTER PROGRAMMING WITHIN THE IT

00:40:24.222 --> 00:40:28.526 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT. YOU REALLY REFORM

00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:29.761 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS JUST COMMON SENSE

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.728 region:rollup2
AND BUTTON IS SOMETHING THAT I

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:32.563 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IS.

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:33.932 region:rollup2
IN ESSENCE OF AGAIN WHAT THE

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:35.400 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO DO WITH

00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:37.001 region:rollup2
PROP FIFTY SEVEN.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.303 region:rollup2
SO IN CONCLUSION WHAT I'D LIKE

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:40.405 region:rollup2
TO SAY IS THAT WE ARE SYSTEM ON

00:40:38.303 --> 00:40:41.372 region:rollup2
THE MOVE WE'RE CHANGING THEM.

00:40:40.405 --> 00:40:42.807 region:rollup2
WE'RE CHANGING THE SYSTEM FOR

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:45.310 region:rollup2
STAFF AND INMATES WERE TRYING TO

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:47.211 region:rollup2
DO SMARTCARD SERRATION WHERE

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:47.812 region:rollup2
NATIONWIDE LEADER IN CORRECTIONS

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:48.513 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK YOU CAN BE PROUD

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:50.281 region:rollup2
OF.

00:40:48.513 --> 00:40:51.582 region:rollup2
IN I DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:53.851 region:rollup2
BELIEVE ME I HOPED SHE WOULD

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:56.321 region:rollup2
TALK TO OUR MARK CRITICS TO.

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:57.255 region:rollup2
INMATES THERE ADVOCATES I'M AND

00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:59.424 region:rollup2
OTHERS INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL

FACILITY.

00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:45.069 region:rollup2
IT IN THIS WAY BUT ONE OF THE

00:41:43.134 --> 00:41:46.704 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WAS

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:48.573 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR

00:41:46.704 --> 00:41:49.140 region:rollup2
CLOSING FACILITIES.

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:50.575 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING REDUCTION IN

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.377 region:rollup2
INMATES WERE SINGLE REDUCTION IN

00:41:50.575 --> 00:41:54.045 region:rollup2
CRIME ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

00:41:52.377 --> 00:41:55.880 region:rollup2
WE'RE COMING OUT OF AN AREA

00:41:54.045 --> 00:41:57.515 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAD STARTED SENDING

00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.718 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE INTO

00:41:57.515 --> 00:42:02.120 region:rollup2
PRISONS AND. REALIZING WHAT.

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:03.654 region:rollup2
AND IMPACT THAT HAS ON

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.656 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WOULD A MISTAKE THAT

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:06.791 region:rollup2
THAT ULTIMATELY WAS SO WE'RE NOT

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:07.825 region:rollup2
GOING TO SEE THE BENEFIT OF THE

00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:10.495 region:rollup2
REFORMER KNOCK AND SEE THE

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:11.763 region:rollup2
BENEFIT. OF THE COST SAVINGS

00:42:10.495 --> 00:42:13.765 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:42:11.763 --> 00:42:14.665 region:rollup2
UNTIL WE REALLY START TO CLOSE

00:42:13.765 --> 00:42:16.868 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE FACILITIES THAT WERE

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:18.870 region:rollup2
BUILT.

00:42:16.868 --> 00:42:19.904 region:rollup2
IN THAT FRENZY TO TO BUILD

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.073 region:rollup2
PRISONS AND MAYBE SOME OLDER

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:22.640 region:rollup2
ONES I COMPLETELY AGREE WE CAN'T

00:42:22.073 --> 00:42:24.542 region:rollup2
BE SENDING PRISONERS OUT OF

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.744 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:27.612 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO KEEP THEM HERE AND IF

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:28.646 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO START DOING THAT

00:42:27.612 --> 00:42:31.115 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:34.018 region:rollup2
RESPECTS YOUR STAFF THAT PEOPLE

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:35.686 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WORKING THERE AND. DIED.

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:37.889 region:rollup2
NOT DO IT WITHOUT A SENSITIVITY

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:39.557 region:rollup2
TO WHAT THAT WORKFORCE IS IT AND

00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:41.459 region:rollup2
WHO THEY'RE BRINGING. WHICH

00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:43.528 region:rollup2
MEANS THERE NEEDS TO BE A PLAYER

00:42:41.459 --> 00:42:45.096 region:rollup2
THERE NEEDS TO BE A THOUGHT OF

00:42:43.528 --> 00:42:46.564 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WANT TO GO OVER TIME.

00:42:45.096 --> 00:42:48.299 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE GET THERE AND SO IF

00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:50.101 region:rollup2
WE CAN.

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:51.669 region:rollup2
HAVE IF WE WILL HAVE A BETTER

00:42:50.101 --> 00:42:52.770 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT AND I KNOW

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:54.272 region:rollup2
YOU COME IN WITH REQUESTS FOR

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.973 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AND.

00:42:54.272 --> 00:42:57.108 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THEIR NOT

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:58.509 region:rollup2
HAVING TO PUT THE PLASTIC OVER

00:42:57.108 --> 00:42:59.610 region:rollup2
THE LAMP SHADES TO TO PROTECT

00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:01.279 region:rollup2
THEIR BEDS FROM THE WATER THERE

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.613 region:rollup2
A LOT OF CRUMBLING FACILITIES

00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:04.682 region:rollup2
BUT WE GET CAUGHT UP IN THOSE

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:06.084 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS WHEN. THERE IS THIS

00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:07.585 region:rollup2
NOTION OF WE WE HAVE TO FIX OUR

00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:08.186 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THE FEAR IS THAT

00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:09.187 region:rollup2
WE'RE JUST CREATING MORE BATS

00:43:08.186 --> 00:43:10.988 region:rollup2
WERE

00:43:09.187 --> 00:43:13.224 region:rollup2
S. BUILDING LARGER FACILITIES.

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:14.125 region:rollup2
AND NOT BUILDING THEM IN WAYS

00:43:13.224 --> 00:43:17.028 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE

00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:18.663 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION MODEL THAT.

00:43:17.028 --> 00:43:20.298 region:rollup2
I NO WORK WE'RE HEADING INTO SO

00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:21.699 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT HOW DO WE

00:43:20.298 --> 00:43:23.568 region:rollup2
REALLY LOOK AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:25.336 region:rollup2
WHAT THE CAPACITY IS WHERE WE

00:43:23.568 --> 00:43:28.306 region:rollup2
WANT TO GO. AND START LOOKING AT

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:29.740 region:rollup2
WHAT FACILITIES WE WE CAN START

00:43:28.306 --> 00:43:30.975 region:rollup2
TO MOVE AWAY FROM.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.276 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY FAIR

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:33.444 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND PLEASE DON'T TAKE

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:35.580 region:rollup2
FROM MY COMMENTS THAT I DON'T

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:37.448 region:rollup2
THINK AT SOME POINT. THAT WE DO

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.115 region:rollup2
NEED TO CLOSE.

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:40.718 region:rollup2
PRISONS.

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:41.953 region:rollup2
PROP FIFTY SEVEN WILL DO THAT

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:43.955 region:rollup2
LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU THAT IN

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:45.823 region:rollup2
SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:47.558 region:rollup2
WHO'S SEVEN MONTHS AGO OR SO.

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:48.960 region:rollup2
ARE WE WERE THREE HUNDRED AND

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:50.061 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE INMATES UNDER THE

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.195 region:rollup2
FEDERAL CAP

00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:53.164 region:rollup2
THAT THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:54.532 region:rollup2
INMATES IS IS TRULY A BAD

00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:55.700 region:rollup2
WEEKEND IN OUR WORLD. BECAUSE WE

00:43:54.532 --> 00:43:57.335 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OF HOW

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.936 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY SAN INMATES TO US

00:43:57.335 --> 00:44:00.471 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE. IT

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:02.073 region:rollup2
WAS A LOT OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS TO

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:04.175 region:rollup2
THAT PERIOD WHEN WE GO OVER THAT

00:44:02.073 --> 00:44:06.244 region:rollup2
CAP WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT FEDERAL

00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:07.678 region:rollup2
COURT. OF TO A COMPLIANCE

00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:09.413 region:rollup2
OFFICER RELEASES OFFENDERS

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:10.348 region:rollup2
THAT IS ONE OF THE ESSENCE OF

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:12.750 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO STOP THAT'S

00:44:10.348 --> 00:44:14.819 region:rollup2
WHAT. PROP FIFTY SEVEN DID.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.354 region:rollup2
IF IF IT WEREN'T FOR PROP FIFTY

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:17.622 region:rollup2
SEVEN WE WOULD BE OVER THE CAP

00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:18.990 region:rollup2
FACING COURT. BATTLE RELEASES

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:21.025 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.193 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS THE FACT OF THE

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:24.629 region:rollup2
MATTER WE.

00:44:22.193 --> 00:44:26.697 region:rollup2
NEEDED PROP FIFTY SEVEN TO WORK.

00:44:24.629 --> 00:44:28.466 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE INSTABILITY OF

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:30.168 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION IN INITIATIVE

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:31.469 region:rollup2
THAT IS YOU KNOW IS GETTING

00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:32.603 region:rollup2
SIGNATURES TODAY THAT'S GONNA

00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:34.939 region:rollup2
WIPE OUT OUR.

00:44:32.603 --> 00:44:37.408 region:rollup2
SAVINGS PUTS US IN THIS

00:44:34.939 --> 00:44:38.009 region:rollup2
TERRIBLE SITUATION AND AS A

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:39.777 region:rollup2
SECRETARY WHAT I WOULD SAY TO

00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:41.078 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:44:39.777 --> 00:44:43.581 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW AND TALKING TO THE

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:45.182 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR DIRECTLY WE DO NOT WANT

00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:45.716 region:rollup2
ITS NOT GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:46.884 region:rollup2
TO RELEASE VENDORS BY THE

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:48.152 region:rollup2
COURTS.

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:49.954 region:rollup2
WHAT FIFTY SEVEN DID IS IT

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:51.122 region:rollup2
CHANGED THAT INSTEAD OF THE

00:44:49.954 --> 00:44:52.557 region:rollup2
COURTS JUST RELEASING

00:44:51.122 --> 00:44:53.558 region:rollup2
INDISCRIMINATELY OFFENDERS

00:44:52.557 --> 00:44:55.259 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS THAT ARE GOING TO

00:44:53.558 --> 00:44:56.827 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS THAT ARE GOING INTO A

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:58.563 region:rollup2
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THEY CAN

00:44:56.827 --> 00:45:00.431 region:rollup2
EARN THEIR WAY OUT THAT IS A

00:44:58.563 --> 00:45:02.567 region:rollup2
MUCH BETTER WAY TO DO IT? AND I

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:03.868 region:rollup2
ALSO SAY TO YOU FOR. THIRTY FIVE

00:45:02.567 --> 00:45:05.036 region:rollup2
YEARS I WORKED IN THE APARTMENT

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.837 region:rollup2
WAS A TWO HUNDRED PERCENT

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:08.139 region:rollup2
OVERCROWDING EVERY SPACE IN THE

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:10.975 region:rollup2
PRISON WAS.

00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:12.276 region:rollup2
HUMAN DENSITY JAMS AND DAY ROOMS

00:45:10.975 --> 00:45:14.912 region:rollup2
AND WE GOT WHAT WE SET OUT WE

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:16.681 region:rollup2
GOT A VIOLENCE WE GOT WORSE

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:18.049 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL WHEN WE GOT OUT.

00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:20.151 region:rollup2
I TO YOUR POINT ABOUT HAVING A

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:21.485 region:rollup2
PLAN I THINK THAT THAT WE HAVE

00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:22.386 region:rollup2
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THIS

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:24.455 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:26.457 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES LOOKING IN THE

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:28.292 region:rollup2
FUTURE I THINK THE LA DOES

00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:29.794 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION IS JUST WAY PRO

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:32.029 region:rollup2
PREMATURE NOTWITHSTANDING THE

00:45:29.794 --> 00:45:34.498 region:rollup2
INSENSITIVITY TO MY STAFF IT AT.

00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:36.667 region:rollup2
TO PRISON OR THE UNION.

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:37.768 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES NEED TO BE A PLAN

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:40.938 region:rollup2
WE DO NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION.

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:42.340 region:rollup2
HOME AS THE POPULATION IS.

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:44.141 region:rollup2
REDUCED.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:45.476 region:rollup2
HOW HOW DO WE GO ABOUT CLOSING

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:46.877 region:rollup2
THE PRISON I THINK IT'S OF

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:48.846 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE FAIR CONVERSATION I

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:50.615 region:rollup2
JUST THINK? I'M IN THIS BUDGET

00:45:48.846 --> 00:45:52.650 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME IT'S.

00:45:50.615 --> 00:45:55.820 region:rollup2
JUST NOT DO MY UNDERSTANDING

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:59.023 region:rollup2
SENSITIVITY TO THIS AND AND.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.124 region:rollup2
MAYOR MADE OUT BE PREMATURE BUT.

00:45:59.023 --> 00:46:02.260 region:rollup2
GETTING OUT AHEAD OF THIS

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:03.728 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IN PUTTING TOGETHER

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.429 region:rollup2
A PLAN PUTTING THE OTHER SORT OF

00:46:03.728 --> 00:46:07.131 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE HOW WE

00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:08.933 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY GET THERE SINCE WE

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:10.701 region:rollup2
SEEM TO AGREE THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:46:08.933 --> 00:46:11.869 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUSING ON FACILITIES.

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:13.638 region:rollup2
BOTH ENSURING THAT THE

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:15.206 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE

00:46:13.638 --> 00:46:16.540 region:rollup2
CATS REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS THAT

00:46:15.206 --> 00:46:17.942 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNOW WORK IN THAT THAT

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.744 region:rollup2
ARE APPROPRIATE.

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:27.451 region:rollup2
BUT ADDRESSING SOME OF THE OLDER

00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:28.619 region:rollup2
ONES IN AND

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:30.488 region:rollup2
AND THEN I ALSO JUST WANT TO

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:32.990 region:rollup2
MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT DJJ P.

00:46:30.488 --> 00:46:34.392 region:rollup2
SINCE YOU BROUGHT THAT UP.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:36.294 region:rollup2
THAT IS VERY INTERESTING TO AND

00:46:34.392 --> 00:46:38.029 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED A BE

00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:39.430 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN KNOW IT LAST YEAR

00:46:38.029 --> 00:46:41.032 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THE.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:42.466 region:rollup2
THE AGE AND ALL THE SCIENCE

00:46:41.032 --> 00:46:43.401 region:rollup2
REALLY POINTS THAT AGE OF TWENTY

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.502 region:rollup2
FIVE AND I THINK THIS IS IN LINE

00:46:43.401 --> 00:46:45.703 region:rollup2
WITH IT.

00:46:44.502 --> 00:46:47.638 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME CONCERN

00:46:45.703 --> 00:46:48.906 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:51.642 region:rollup2
HOLDING JUVENILE OFFENDERS

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:55.179 region:rollup2
LONGER ABOUT NOT. GETTING THEM

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:56.714 region:rollup2
BACK TO THEIR. LOCAL.

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:58.149 region:rollup2
FACILITIES BECAUSE KIDS DO

00:46:56.714 --> 00:46:58.749 region:rollup2
BETTER WHEN THEY'RE CLOSER TO

00:46:58.149 --> 00:47:01.619 region:rollup2
HOME WHEN THEY'RE CLOSER TO

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:02.820 region:rollup2
FAMILY. IN SO IF WE THINK WE

00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:04.455 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.923 region:rollup2
THIS AND IT I DON'T DISAGREE

00:47:04.455 --> 00:47:07.958 region:rollup2
WITH THIS PROMISE OF KEEPING.

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:10.194 region:rollup2
YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS AWAY FROM THE

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:11.896 region:rollup2
ADULT PRISONS BUT WE ALSO HAVE

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:12.863 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT.

00:47:11.896 --> 00:47:14.965 region:rollup2
LENGTHENING THE TIME THAT

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:15.566 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE INDEED JJ WE

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:17.368 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:18.869 region:rollup2
STILL. ENSURING THAT THEY'RE

00:47:17.368 --> 00:47:21.238 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE GOING BACK TO THE

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:23.074 region:rollup2
JUVENILE. FACILITIES IN THEIR

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:25.376 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND WE NEED TO BOLSTER

00:47:23.074 --> 00:47:27.578 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAM SO THAT THEY ARE

00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:29.080 region:rollup2
STRONGER. THERE SO WE WERE NOT

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:31.082 region:rollup2
PULLING KIDS UP TO STOCK TO

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.816 region:rollup2
LEAVE THEM CLOSER THEIR

00:47:31.082 --> 00:47:34.185 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES CLOSER THEIR

00:47:31.816 --> 00:47:36.387 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THEY TEND TO DO BETTER.

00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:38.055 region:rollup2
AND SO I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

00:47:36.387 --> 00:47:38.956 region:rollup2
WITH THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:43.427 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT.

00:47:38.956 --> 00:47:45.296 region:rollup2
THAT. THAT WHOLE PROCESS.

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:47.298 region:rollup2
SO HOLISTICALLY AND WHERE KIDS

00:47:45.296 --> 00:47:48.966 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE PLACED AS WE TRY TO

00:47:47.298 --> 00:47:51.569 region:rollup2
PROTECT THEM FROM GOING. INTO

00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:52.570 region:rollup2
ADULT POPULATIONS UNNECESSARILY

00:47:51.569 --> 00:47:54.305 region:rollup2
YOU IF YOU HAVE FAIR ENOUGH I

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:56.540 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE UNITED TYPE WE

00:47:54.305 --> 00:47:57.908 region:rollup2
HAD TEN THOUSAND YOU. FULL

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.577 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS HAVE WITHIN DJJ TODAY

00:47:57.908 --> 00:48:01.011 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AROUND SIX HUNDRED

00:47:59.577 --> 00:48:02.980 region:rollup2
LITTLE OVER SIX HUNDRED.

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:05.616 region:rollup2
WE ARE GETTING AND ONLY THE

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.385 region:rollup2
MOST CHALLENGING CASES THE

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:08.519 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE KEEPING MORE THE

00:48:07.385 --> 00:48:10.821 region:rollup2
JUVENILES.

00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:12.690 region:rollup2
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH WITH

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:13.357 region:rollup2
THIS OF PROPOSAL WOULD DO IS IF

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.593 region:rollup2
AN OFFENDER.

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:17.094 region:rollup2
THAT'S UNDER UNDER THE AGE OF

00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:19.830 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE.

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:21.499 region:rollup2
IS DOING WELL IN BJJ.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:23.167 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY JUST KEEPING THEM

00:48:21.499 --> 00:48:23.701 region:rollup2
IN THAT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUE

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:25.436 region:rollup2
WITH THAT'S THAT WHEN HE

00:48:23.701 --> 00:48:26.771 region:rollup2
COMPLETES HIS SENTENCE HE CAN GO

00:48:25.436 --> 00:48:27.838 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE COMMUNITY BUT I

00:48:26.771 --> 00:48:29.373 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED TO

00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:31.142 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. I I DON'T

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:32.743 region:rollup2
WANT YOU TO THINK THIS IS TAKING

00:48:31.142 --> 00:48:35.446 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS THAT ARE AN ADULT

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:38.716 region:rollup2
PRISON. POPPING THEM AND DJJ

00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:40.818 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT OUR INTENT IT NO NO

00:48:38.716 --> 00:48:42.086 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND YOUR TEN AND. THEN

00:48:40.818 --> 00:48:43.487 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH THAT INTENT OF OF

00:48:42.086 --> 00:48:44.121 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT THEY'RE SERVING

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:45.723 region:rollup2
THEIR TIME.

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:46.624 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE BEING SUCCESSFUL

00:48:45.723 --> 00:48:48.459 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS SOON AS THEY GO TO

00:48:46.624 --> 00:48:50.261 region:rollup2
THE DOUGH? PRISON.

00:48:48.459 --> 00:48:52.396 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S NOT REALLY WARRANTED

00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:52.997 region:rollup2
THAT HAS THAT CAN REALLY HURT

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:54.832 region:rollup2
THEIR REHABILITATION AND HURT

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:56.534 region:rollup2
WHO THEY ARE.

00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:57.034 region:rollup2
ON THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:48:56.534 --> 00:48:58.536 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS IN

00:48:57.034 --> 00:49:00.070 region:rollup2
ASSURING THAT.

00:48:58.536 --> 00:49:02.139 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:04.475 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT WHERE KIDS MIGHT BE

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:05.242 region:rollup2
INDEED JJ LONGER THAT WAR THAT

00:49:04.475 --> 00:49:06.844 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA BE BEING

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:07.878 region:rollup2
HELD THE DJJ WHEN THEY REALLY

00:49:06.844 --> 00:49:08.846 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE FINDING

00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:10.548 region:rollup2
WAYS TO GET THEM BACK TO THEIR

00:49:08.846 --> 00:49:12.716 region:rollup2
LOCAL COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT'S

00:49:10.548 --> 00:49:14.151 region:rollup2
WHAT THE SENSITIVITY IS NOT TO

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:16.353 region:rollup2
THE AGE WHERE.

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:18.722 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THAT THEN THAT'S I

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:20.691 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH YOU ON A PERSON

00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:23.160 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON.

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:26.530 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:29.433 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY HAVE SEVERAL

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:30.901 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS INTO IT AND MAYBE WE

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:32.303 region:rollup2
CAN COOK BUT NO ONE IS HERE ALL.

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:34.538 region:rollup2
ALL MORNING ON A SUB YOU CAN YOU

00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:35.673 region:rollup2
CAN WORK ON AND GET BACK.

.

00:49:35.673 --> 00:49:39.577 region:rollup2
BUT THEN I I'M ACTION REAL

00:49:37.475 --> 00:49:41.345 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE TO TO POSITION YOUR

00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:43.714 region:rollup2
URANUS AS A. VOICE IS A FORMER

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:44.582 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRAT WHEN. YOU'RE AT THE

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:45.115 region:rollup2
MERCY OF AYE NOW TALK ABOUT

00:49:44.582 --> 00:49:45.783 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS ELECTED

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:48.219 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS WHO COME UP WITH THESE

00:49:45.783 --> 00:49:50.888 region:rollup2
IDEAS. LIKE PROP 47-57.

00:49:48.219 --> 00:49:53.224 region:rollup2
ONE AMOUNT AB ONE ON I.

00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:55.893 region:rollup2
WITHOUT REALLY CONSULTING WITH

00:49:53.224 --> 00:49:57.161 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE LEFT IMPLEMENTED A

00:49:55.893 --> 00:49:58.262 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE CAUGHT.

00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:59.763 region:rollup2
WHICH YEAR WOULD NOT ENOUGH

RESOURCES NOW ENOUGH MONEY.

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:02.533 region:rollup2
AND QUITE FRANKLY SOMETIMES IT'S

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:03.934 region:rollup2
JUST A STUPID IDEA BUT WE YOU

00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:05.903 region:rollup2
HAVE TO IMPLEMENT.

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:07.404 region:rollup2
AND SO I I.

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:08.873 region:rollup2
I FEEL WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:10.574 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN

00:50:08.873 --> 00:50:12.476 region:rollup2
THAT SAME SITUATION ON.

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:14.979 region:rollup2
I WORK FOR THE CITY OF LA. AND

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:17.615 region:rollup2

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:27.825 region:rollup2
AND I IMAGINE DJJ SALT BUT TO

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:31.061 region:rollup2
START WITH THAT.

00:50:27.825 --> 00:50:32.229 region:rollup2
AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE DO NEED.

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:33.197 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND EVEN

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:34.365 region:rollup2
THOUGH IT MAY NOT TOTALLY BE

00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:36.567 region:rollup2
UNDER YOUR PURVIEW.

00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:38.502 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE I MEAN I AM

00:50:36.567 --> 00:50:41.405 region:rollup2

THAT'S A GOOD YET J..

00:50:45.009 --> 00:50:48.279 region:rollup2
SO FOR A WHOLE KID IS LIKE TWO

HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH IS LIKE

00:50:48.279 --> 00:50:50.748 region:rollup2

ON ONE YEAR'S WORTH THE MONEY

00:50:54.652 --> 00:50:58.989 region:rollup2
THAT WE SPEND ON THEM. AND SO WE

00:50:56.954 --> 00:51:00.491 region:rollup2

COMMUNITY GETS ECONOMY OF SCALE

00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:25.182 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME SIX HUNDRED WELL

00:51:23.514 --> 00:51:26.550 region:rollup2
ARMED YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS IN

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:27.918 region:rollup2
THREE FACILITIES. I'M WOULD

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.053 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE MOST INTENSIVE

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:31.188 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH.

00:51:29.053 --> 00:51:33.090 region:rollup2
AND PROGRAMMING FOR THAT

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:35.526 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT YOU CAN.

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:38.162 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY A NATIONAL.

00:51:35.526 --> 00:51:39.797 region:rollup2
MODEL IT IS IN CREDIBLY

00:51:38.162 --> 00:51:41.832 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT

00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:44.201 region:rollup2
IT AND I CERTAINLY SEE WHY

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:47.037 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WOULD QUESTION AND I'VE

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:51.175 region:rollup2
HEARD HEARD THE COMMENT YOU GET

00:51:47.037 --> 00:51:52.743 region:rollup2
SENDS STANFORD MAMA CONDOS

00:51:51.175 --> 00:51:57.414 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTANDABLE.

00:51:52.743 --> 00:51:58.482 region:rollup2
PERCENT LIZZIE V. ALCAZAR.

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:59.483 region:rollup2
THE MOST CHALLENGING MENTAL

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:00.517 region:rollup2
HEALTH VIOLENT SEX OFFENDERS

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:01.685 region:rollup2
THERE REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:52:00.517 --> 00:52:01.986 region:rollup2
OF EFFORT I BELIEVE TO TRY TO

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.821 region:rollup2
GET THEM.

00:52:01.986 --> 00:52:05.556 region:rollup2
INTO A. PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE

00:52:03.821 --> 00:52:08.092 region:rollup2
IN SOCIETY AND IT COSTS A LOT OF

00:52:05.556 --> 00:52:08.993 region:rollup2
MONEY TO DO SO. AND SO I I LOOK

00:52:08.092 --> 00:52:11.195 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION AND

00:52:08.993 --> 00:52:12.296 region:rollup2
AT IN HOW WE ADDRESS IT BUT I

00:52:11.195 --> 00:52:14.198 region:rollup2
JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU

.

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:54.344 region:rollup2
BOAT FLOATED IF I CAN SAY IT

00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:56.146 region:rollup2

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:18.502 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S FAIR FOR YOU TO SAY

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:19.303 region:rollup2
WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE VISION

00:57:18.502 --> 00:57:19.803 region:rollup2
INTO THE FUTURE.

00:57:19.303 --> 00:57:21.805 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY SOME OF OUR

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:22.272 region:rollup2
REQUESTING MAY IMPLEMENT RIFTS

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:24.107 region:rollup2
IN IN THOSE THINGS ARE

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:25.776 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:27.077 region:rollup2

YEARS TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD

00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:33.984 region:rollup2
BUT IS THIS AT THE SAME TIME

00:57:32.983 --> 00:57:36.586 region:rollup2
THAT WE TRY TO LOOK AT THAT

00:57:33.984 --> 00:57:37.321 region:rollup2
VISION AND MAYBE THIS IS.

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:38.689 region:rollup2
YET MAYBE MY OWN FAILURES.

00:57:37.321 --> 00:57:39.289 region:rollup2

JOBS I JUST AFFECT THE FINANCIAL

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:14.871 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE AS TO WHAT THE RETURN

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:16.306 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS COULD BE FROZE.

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:17.941 region:rollup2

AND WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:23.713 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FOR THE STATE TO GIVE

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:30.187 region:rollup2
I'M CHARGED WITH HOUSING

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:31.855 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS THAT ARE COMMITTED BY

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:33.823 region:rollup2
THE COURTS AND SO.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:34.858 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT ALWAYS

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.826 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT MASS

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:38.328 region:rollup2
INCARCERATION SPIRALING OUT A

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:40.997 region:rollup2
STATE I MEAN SPIRALING BUDGETS.

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:42.566 region:rollup2
.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:44.401 region:rollup2
THOUGH OVER INCARCERATION OF

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:46.570 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF COLOR YOU KNOW ALL OF

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:48.104 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE ISSUES STEPS IT

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:48.972 region:rollup2
BEFORE SO I HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:50.273 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE ABOUT

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:51.608 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND INMATES

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:53.743 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:55.712 region:rollup2
AND GROWS ABOUT A THOUSAND.

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:57.080 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:58.648 region:rollup2
SO IN WHAT WE DO THESE

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.383 region:rollup2
POPULATION REDUCTION MEASURES TO

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:01.585 region:rollup2
REDUCE LIKE PROP FIFTY SEVEN.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:03.286 region:rollup2
YOU HOPE THAT YOU WILL SEE A

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:04.521 region:rollup2
DECLINE IN THE POPULATION BUT IT

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:06.222 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S.

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:08.191 region:rollup2
IN STONE THAT THAT'S GOING TO

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.792 region:rollup2
HAPPEN THEN I SO I DON'T KNOW IF

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:10.660 region:rollup2
I CAN GET YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:12.095 region:rollup2
RETURN ON INVESTMENT BUT I THINK

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.996 region:rollup2
THAT THE PRISON PRISON SYSTEMS

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:14.331 region:rollup2
INTERCALL TO KEEPING PUBLIC

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:16.132 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:17.734 region:rollup2
I THINK THE LEADING LEADING THE

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:19.102 region:rollup2
COURTS JUST LET OUT INMATES.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.003 region:rollup2
IT'S TERRIBLE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.271 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL RUE THE DAY THAT

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:22.505 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENS

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.673 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.475 region:rollup2
TO KEEP OUR PRISON SYSTEM UP

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:26.743 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED PEOPLE THAT COME TO

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.677 region:rollup2
US FROM THE COURTS TO PROTECT

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:28.845 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY I DON'T THINK

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:31.114 region:rollup2

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:52.261 region:rollup2
MESSAGE THAT.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:53.796 region:rollup2
EVEN IN THE RIP. IN THE THOUGHT

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:55.632 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE DO INCREASES

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:57.633 region:rollup2
WEATHERED AND STAFF OR FUNDING

01:08:55.632 --> 01:08:59.102 region:rollup2
OR BUDGET. THE SUCTION IS THAT

01:08:57.633 --> 01:09:01.738 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LARGER PLAN DOWN THE

01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:02.772 region:rollup2
ROLE THAT IT COOPER THAT THESE

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:05.541 region:rollup2
IF WE MAKE THE.

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:06.909 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN SAY RESOURCES THE

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:08.711 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION IS THAT THAT WE WILL

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:09.846 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:12.248 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE POPULATION THAT

01:09:09.846 --> 01:09:13.549 region:rollup2
MEASLES RESOURCES WILL DECLINE.

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:15.284 region:rollup2
I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S GOING

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:17.286 region:rollup2
TO BE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WHO

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:18.021 region:rollup2
ARE MOST AFFECTED BY IT AND

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:20.823 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE STAFF OF THESE

01:09:18.021 --> 01:09:23.059 region:rollup2
FACILITIES TO ACTUALLY COME UP.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:24.794 region:rollup2
WITH A PLAN BECAUSE BUT NO ONE

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:26.929 region:rollup2
WRITES A PLAN THAT CREATES THEIR

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:29.165 region:rollup2
EXTINCTION I MEAN SELDOM DO THEY

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:31.300 region:rollup2
DO THAT ALSO AS A RESULT I THINK

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:33.169 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE LOOK AT THE LA WAS

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.138 region:rollup2
KIND OF AN INDEPENDENT BODY.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:37.173 region:rollup2
THAT'S LOOKING AT IT THAT WE'VE

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:39.809 region:rollup2
MADE A COMMENT LAST YEAR IN THE.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:41.511 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET HEARINGS THAT.

01:09:39.809 --> 01:09:43.279 region:rollup2
THAT CLEARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:44.947 region:rollup2
REPAIRS THAT NEED TO BE MADE AND

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:47.717 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR MY CONCERNS IT'S BEEN

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:50.686 region:rollup2
ALWAYS THAT. WE NEED TO KNOW.

01:09:47.717 --> 01:09:52.789 region:rollup2
UP IF IT MAKING THE REPAIRS AT

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:54.791 region:rollup2
THE FACILITY SLOW LAST LONGER.

01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:58.761 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE NEEDS OF THE

01:09:54.791 --> 01:10:01.364 region:rollup2
POPULATION SO WHY BUILD A BRAND

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:02.398 region:rollup2
NEW ROOF ON A BUILDING THAT NEXT

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:03.866 region:rollup2
YEAR WE'RE GOING TO SHUT DOWN.

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:07.003 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:09.005 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND A WHAT I LOOKED AT

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:10.807 region:rollup2
THE LA GOALS ARE RECOMMENDATION

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:12.809 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS TO NORCO

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:14.977 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY.

01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:17.313 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY WERE LOOKING AT

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:20.383 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THAT THAT THE

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:25.888 region:rollup2
REPAIR ON THAT FACILITY IS IT'S

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:26.089 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS. AND IF WE'RE TALKING

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:26.222 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:10:26.089 --> 01:10:26.789 region:rollup2
.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.423 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY SHUTTING DOWN A

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:28.091 region:rollup2
PRISON WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THOSE

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:28.725 region:rollup2
THAT LEVEL OF REPAIR. ON A ON A

01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:29.692 region:rollup2
FACILITY IF IF YOU MAY END UP

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.326 region:rollup2
CLOSING THE FACILITY AND THAT

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:31.127 region:rollup2
ONE OBVIOUSLY HAS THE GREATEST

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:31.727 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF REPAIR ISSUES AND

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:32.328 region:rollup2
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO. I

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:33.029 region:rollup2
THINK LAST YEAR WE ASKED THE

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:34.297 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO SAY IF WE WERE TO

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:35.731 region:rollup2
CLOSE A PRISON WHICH ONE WOULD

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:37.900 region:rollup2
BE CLOSE AND WHAT WILL BE THE

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:39.869 region:rollup2
CONDITION OF THE OF THE. PRISON

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.938 region:rollup2
THAT WE CLOSED AND I WORDS WE

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:42.538 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO REPAIR RULES ON TO

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:44.640 region:rollup2
A PLACE THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:45.174 region:rollup2
CLOSED I MEAN THAT KIND OF STUFF

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.809 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE REST OF THE

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:48.377 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE. OR TO GET INVOLVED IN

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:50.947 region:rollup2
A WHOLE LOT OF CHANGES IN

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:52.315 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IN THIS IN THAT ONLY

01:10:50.947 --> 01:10:52.982 region:rollup2
TO DISCOVER. THAT THIS IS ONE OF

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:55.685 region:rollup2
THE PRISONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:58.488 region:rollup2
CLOSE I THINK LOOKING AT A PLAN.

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:59.122 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE MOVE IN A CERTAIN

01:10:58.488 --> 01:10:59.455 region:rollup2
DIRECTION WHAT WHAT THAT PLAN

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:01.591 region:rollup2
LOOKED LIKE.

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:02.959 region:rollup2
AND DO WHAT RESOURCES MIGHT BE

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.359 region:rollup2
SAVED IN THE PROCESS OF DOING

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:07.096 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:07.530 region:rollup2
EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:07.663 region:rollup2
ONLY THE BUDGET FOR.

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:09.332 region:rollup2
.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:11.767 region:rollup2
THIS DEPARTMENT HAS INCREASED

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:12.368 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES A ENORMOUSLY MUCH MORE

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:14.103 region:rollup2
THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS AND I

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:16.072 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF POPULATION

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:17.140 region:rollup2
KEPT GROWING. AND WILL HEAL A

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:18.775 region:rollup2
BIT MORE ABOUT POPULATION IN A

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.109 region:rollup2
MINUTE THAT THE GUARDS TO WHY WE

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:22.545 region:rollup2
DID ALSO SEEMS TO BE GOING UP

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:24.280 region:rollup2
AND DOWN. IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT I

01:11:22.545 --> 01:11:26.816 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED TO HAVE. THAT

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.217 region:rollup2
VISION THAT IF WE ARE BOTH WITH

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:30.119 region:rollup2
GIVING SOMEONE ASKED IF YOU GET

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:31.120 region:rollup2
A MAKING PERMANENT POSITIONS ARE

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:33.289 region:rollup2
WE GONNA NEED THOSE PERMANENT

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.091 region:rollup2
POSITIONS. IN THE FUTURE AMID IF

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:36.058 region:rollup2
WE IF WE REDUCING POPULATION AND

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:37.326 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ISSUES DO YOU HAVE

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:39.529 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FOLKS RETIRING TO

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:39.829 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE THAT IF THERE IS A

01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:41.130 region:rollup2
REDUCTION.

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:42.965 region:rollup2
I MEAN THOSE KINDS OF ARGUMENTS

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.167 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HELPFUL AYE IF WE LOOK

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:46.302 region:rollup2
AT THE POSITIONS BECAUSE IF

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:48.004 region:rollup2
THERE AYE IF PEOPLE THERE ARE A

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:49.605 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AGE IN MAY BE. LOOKING

01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:50.907 region:rollup2
AT RETIREMENT AND X. THREE FOUR

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:52.675 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS AND YOU BRING YOU

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:53.342 region:rollup2
KNOW PERMIT PEOPLE THEN THAT'S

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:55.211 region:rollup2
MAKES SENSE BUT IF YOU BRING UP

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:56.979 region:rollup2
PERMITS. INDIVIDUALS AND THERE'S

01:11:55.211 --> 01:11:57.780 region:rollup2
NO.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.382 region:rollup2
.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:00.416 region:rollup2
FOLKS RETIRING WITHIN GOD HAVE

01:11:59.382 --> 01:12:01.584 region:rollup2
TO GET INVOLVED IN LAOS AND

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.752 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:04.921 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU DO LAYOFFS

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:06.355 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY GOES CRAZY OKAY. AND

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:07.990 region:rollup2
UP AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:09.158 region:rollup2
CONCERNS OF THAT THAT WE HAVE.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.459 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:11.127 region:rollup2

FROM MEMBERS HERE.

01:16:52.475 --> 01:16:55.544 region:rollup2
IF I COULD JUST PROVIDE  LITTLE

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:56.178 region:rollup2
MORE CONTEXT FOR THE NUMBER SO

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:57.713 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE GONNA

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:58.848 region:rollup2

WHERE.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:08.123 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET IS BASED ON AVERAGE

01:17:06.889 --> 01:17:09.492 region:rollup2
DAILY POPULATION SO THERE'S

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:11.460 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE

01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:11.961 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE. TWO NUMBERS.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:15.531 region:rollup2

CHAIR. I IN GENERAL WE WITHHOLD

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:26.775 region:rollup2
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:27.376 region:rollup2
POPULATION DRIVEN BUDGET

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:29.478 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS AND TELL THEM A

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:31.180 region:rollup2
REVISION. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:32.448 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON THE

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:33.983 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:35.317 region:rollup2
PLANNED TO ACCOMMODATE THE

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:36.886 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED POPULATION

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:38.954 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:39.722 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN.

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:41.724 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T RAISE CONCERNS

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:44.360 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:45.561 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS OF THE IMPACT OF

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.896 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN ON THE

01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:48.797 region:rollup2
INMATE POPULATION.

01:17:46.896 --> 01:17:50.499 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE THINK THAT THE INMATE

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:52.501 region:rollup2
POPULATION DECLINE THAT THEY'RE

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.536 region:rollup2
PROJECTING. PRESENTS THE

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.470 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY

01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:56.805 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:59.542 region:rollup2
APPROACHES.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:18:01.944 region:rollup2
AND WE FIND. THAT CDC ARE COULD

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:02.878 region:rollup2
CLOSE A STATE PRISON AND STILL

01:18:01.944 --> 01:18:04.446 region:rollup2
MAKE A SIGNIFICANT.

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:06.515 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN THESE ABOUT A

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:08.150 region:rollup2
STATE CONTRACT BEDS BY CLOSING

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:10.286 region:rollup2
THE FACILITY IN MISSISSIPPI.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:11.620 region:rollup2
HOWEVER TO DO THAT AND TO

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:13.155 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.723 region:rollup2
OVERCROWDING IN OUR STATE OWNED

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:16.125 region:rollup2
AND OPERATED PRISONS AS WOULD BE

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:17.693 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:21.163 region:rollup2
PLAN. THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:22.631 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THE ARIZONA CONTRACT.

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:24.066 region:rollup2
ONE POSSIBLE PRISON TO CLOSE AS

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:25.568 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY IS

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:27.169 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:29.371 region:rollup2
CENTER IN NORCO.

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:30.406 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE THEY THAT

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:32.208 region:rollup2
GOVERN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:33.375 region:rollup2
HAS PROPOSED CLOSING IN THE PAST

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:35.744 region:rollup2
DUE TO ITS DETERIORATING

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.946 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND AT THAT TIME.

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:38.681 region:rollup2
AS MADE IT WOULD COST OVER A

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:40.082 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO FULLY

01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:41.850 region:rollup2
RENOVATE.

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:43.385 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT CLOSING THE

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.620 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:46.689 region:rollup2
AND THE MISSISSIPPI CONTRACT

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.222 region:rollup2
FACILITY WOULD EVENTUALLY RESULT

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:49.091 region:rollup2
IN ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:50.826 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN AND.

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:52.595 region:rollup2
SAVINGS RELATIVE TO THE

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:54.196 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PLAN.

01:18:52.595 --> 01:18:57.066 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO AVOID THE NEED TO

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:57.1000 region:rollup2
RENOVATE CRC.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:59.401 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:18:57.1000 --> 01:19:01.370 region:rollup2
THAT ON OUR PROPOSAL COULD

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:02.838 region:rollup2
TEMPORARILY RESULT IN LOWER

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:04.540 region:rollup2
SAVINGS MATH RELATIVE TO THE

01:19:02.838 --> 01:19:06.041 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PLAN WHILE CRC IS

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:07.743 region:rollup2
BEING CLOSED. BUT IN THE LONG

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:08.911 region:rollup2
TERM WE EXPECT THE SAVINGS WOULD

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:10.112 region:rollup2
GREATLY EXCEED THE GOVERNOR'S

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:12.314 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:13.549 region:rollup2
SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:16.218 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER DIRECTING

01:19:13.549 --> 01:19:17.720 region:rollup2
STYLE CDC ARE TO CLOSE YOUR SEE

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:19.955 region:rollup2
AND THE MISSISSIPPI FACILITY.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:21.657 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF CLOSING BOTH OUT OF

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:23.325 region:rollup2
STATE CONTRACT FACILITIES IF THE

01:19:21.657 --> 01:19:24.760 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DECIDES.

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:46.782 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT SECRETARY KERN AND

01:19:44.747 --> 01:19:49.151 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:50.919 region:rollup2
SO FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT AWARE

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:52.421 region:rollup2
OF A COURT ORDER THAT REQUIRES

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:53.689 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO ELIMINATE ITS USE

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:54.890 region:rollup2
OF OUT OF STATE CONTRACT

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:56.825 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:57.893 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THIS THE COURT HAS

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:59.328 region:rollup2
ORDERED THE STATE TO PROVIDE

01:19:57.893 --> 01:20:01.397 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE LEVELS OF HEALTH CARE

01:19:59.328 --> 01:20:02.598 region:rollup2
TO INMATES.

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:04.033 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE SEE ARE SEE WHAT'S

01:20:02.598 --> 01:20:05.534 region:rollup2
UP PLAN FOR CLOSURE IN THE PAST

01:20:04.033 --> 01:20:06.902 region:rollup2
AND NEVER RECEIVED A HEALTH CARE

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:09.071 region:rollup2
FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AS

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:11.974 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER PRISONS HAVE.

01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:13.442 region:rollup2
ANY FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:15.377 region:rollup2
COURT ORDER WHICH I BELIEVE THE

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:16.445 region:rollup2
SECRETARY WAS REFERRING TO AND

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:18.213 region:rollup2
THE COURT SAID THAT DEFENDANTS

01:20:16.445 --> 01:20:19.381 region:rollup2
SHALL EXPLORE WAYS TO ATTEMPT TO

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:20.082 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INMATES

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:21.517 region:rollup2
HOUSED IN OUT OF STATE

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:23.919 region:rollup2
FACILITIES TO THE EXTENT

01:20:21.517 --> 01:20:26.021 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE. SINCE THAT TIME THE

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:26.455 region:rollup2
STATE HAS REDUCED ITS EAT AT

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:28.123 region:rollup2
RICH IT'S.

01:20:26.455 --> 01:20:29.458 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INMATES IN

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:31.060 region:rollup2
OUT OF STATE FACILITIES BY MORE

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:34.229 region:rollup2
THAN HALF.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:36.265 region:rollup2
AND UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE FOR A

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:37.700 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT WE RECOMMEND THE

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:38.867 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THE STATE

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.336 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CONTINUING TO MAKE A

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:42.604 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE USE

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:44.740 region:rollup2
OF OUT OF STATE CONTRACT BEDS.

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:46.775 region:rollup2
IN LESS THE INMATE POPULATION

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:48.544 region:rollup2
DECREASES UNEXPECTEDLY BEYOND

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:50.245 region:rollup2
WHAT IS ANTICIPATED BY

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:51.814 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN AS A

01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:53.382 region:rollup2
RESULT OF TOP PROPOSITIONS FIFTY

01:20:51.814 --> 01:20:55.050 region:rollup2
SEVEN. THIS STATE WILL HAVE TO

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:56.518 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKE COSTLY REPAIRS

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:59.321 region:rollup2
RENOVATIONS AT CRC TO MAKE IT

01:20:56.518 --> 01:21:00.689 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE TO CONTINUE HOUSING

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:02.057 region:rollup2
INMATES THERE IN THE LONG TERM.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:03.792 region:rollup2
BUT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:06.595 region:rollup2
PROPOSED A PLAN TO DO SO.

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:08.097 region:rollup2
AND THEN SECOND ON THE ON THE

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:09.364 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT INMATES BEING

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:12.401 region:rollup2
FURTHER FARTHER AWAY FROM

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:14.336 region:rollup2
FAMILIES IN WHILE IN ME ARIZONA

01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:15.738 region:rollup2
FACILITY. I JUST WANTED TO KNOW

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:18.340 region:rollup2
TO KNOW THAT.

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:19.942 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT A THIRD OF

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:22.845 region:rollup2
THE INMATE POPULATION WAS

01:21:19.942 --> 01:21:24.313 region:rollup2
COMMITTED. FROM LA COUNTY AND

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:26.081 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES IS ABOUT A SEVEN

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:28.050 region:rollup2
HOUR DRIVE FROM ELY ARIZONA

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:30.452 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT WHERE THE CONTRACT

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:32.488 region:rollup2
FACILITY IS LOCATED. AND NOT AND

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:34.223 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THREE STATE PRISONS

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:35.290 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GREATER THAN A THREE

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:37.926 region:rollup2
HOUR DRIVE FROM.

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:40.028 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES SO IT'S IT'S

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:41.864 region:rollup2
REASONABLE TO THINK THAT IF IT'S

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:43.065 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR WHETHER MOVE OUT OF THE

01:21:41.864 --> 01:21:44.466 region:rollup2
OUT OF STATE FACILITY IS

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:45.868 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FARTHER FOR MANY

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:46.735 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S FAMILIES.

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:48.937 region:rollup2
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:51.707 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:53.041 region:rollup2

CONSISTENT WITH THE

01:21:58.213 --> 01:22:01.283 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN INCLUDED

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:03.585 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET ACT IT'S JUST A

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:04.553 region:rollup2
DELAYED CLOSURE AS THIS IS STILL

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:06.121 region:rollup2

MADAM CHAIRMAN AT THIS POINT I

01:23:45.754 --> 01:23:49.191 region:rollup2

DIRECTION. A WHICH WOULD

01:24:06.008 --> 01:24:10.178 region:rollup2

COMMITMENTS BUT A GREATER

01:24:17.019 --> 01:24:20.489 region:rollup2
INCREASED WAS OBSERVED AT SECOND

01:24:19.922 --> 01:24:22.658 region:rollup2
STRIKER COMBAT.

01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:24.893 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS FISCAL

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:26.695 region:rollup2

LAST YEAR WE ARE STARTING TO SEE

OUT.

01:24:28.997 --> 01:24:32.768 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:34.570 region:rollup2
TIME THAT HAS PROGRESSED TO

ACTUALLY GIVE IT A FAIR TREND

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:37.372 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS ON THAT WHICH IS WHY I

.

01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:31.393 region:rollup2
THESE ARE SUPPORT POSITIONS THAT

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:32.527 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN ELIMINATED AND OUR

01:30:31.393 --> 01:30:32.761 region:rollup2
BLUEPRINT THAT I MENTIONED

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:34.296 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:35.563 region:rollup2
.

01:30:34.296 --> 01:30:36.898 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME OF THE BLUEPRINT

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:38.833 region:rollup2
THERE WAS.

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:40.702 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATION THAT ARE POORLY

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:43.071 region:rollup2
POPULATION BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:30:40.702 --> 01:30:44.172 region:rollup2
WAS GOING TO DECLINE TO ABOUT

01:30:43.071 --> 01:30:46.207 region:rollup2
TWENTY ABOUT TWENTY NINE

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:47.442 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND AS YOU'VE HEARD NOW

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:48.810 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:50.312 region:rollup2
OUR ACTUAL BUDGET YEAR

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:52.280 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS ARE CLOSER TO FIFTY

01:30:50.312 --> 01:30:52.981 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SO OBVIOUSLY A MATERIAL

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:55.450 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO

01:30:52.981 --> 01:30:58.019 region:rollup2
NUMBERS O WITH THAT IN MIND.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:59.187 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT IS ASKING FOR

WE HAVE.

01:31:26.915 --> 01:31:31.486 region:rollup2
AS JASON SAID WE WERE

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:34.122 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY ZERO BASED ABOUT

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:35.490 region:rollup2
BUDGETED DE UM FIVE YEARS AGO

01:31:34.122 --> 01:31:37.525 region:rollup2
SIX YEARS AGO.

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:38.860 region:rollup2
TO A POPULATION ANTICIPATED

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:41.396 region:rollup2
POPULATION SOMEWHERE AROUND

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:42.931 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE THOUSAND OR SO OUR

01:31:41.396 --> 01:31:44.566 region:rollup2
POPULATION CURRENTLY IS

01:31:42.931 --> 01:31:47.002 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE FORTY SIX TO FORTY

01:31:44.566 --> 01:31:48.703 region:rollup2
SEVEN THOUSAND GROWING TO FIFTY

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:51.006 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SHORTLY.

01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:52.807 region:rollup2
AYE IN THAT TIME ARE ARE NO I'M

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:54.576 region:rollup2
SWORN PERSONNEL ARE SUPPORT

01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:57.045 region:rollup2
SUPER SPUR SINGLE SERVICES THAT

01:31:54.576 --> 01:31:58.780 region:rollup2
ARE NON RATIOS POSITIONS HAVE

01:31:57.045 --> 01:32:00.782 region:rollup2
NOT GROWN WITH THE POPULATION

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:02.250 region:rollup2
WHEREAS OUR OUR PAROLE AGENT

01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:04.052 region:rollup2
POSITIONS WHICH ARE RATIO WOULD.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:05.820 region:rollup2
TO THE PAROLE POPULATION HAVE

01:32:04.052 --> 01:32:07.288 region:rollup2
INCREASED INCREMENTALLY AS THE

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:08.723 region:rollup2
POPULATION HAS INCREASED.

01:32:07.288 --> 01:32:10.859 region:rollup2
I'M JUST TO GIVE YOU A BENCHMARK

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:12.160 region:rollup2
IDEA OF WHAT THAT WHAT THE

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:13.828 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IS.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.296 region:rollup2
IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN OUR

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:17.132 region:rollup2
POPULATION FOR ALL POPULATION

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:19.267 region:rollup2
WAS ABOUT FORTY SIX THOUSAND AND

01:32:17.132 --> 01:32:21.202 region:rollup2
WE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY FOUR

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:22.604 region:rollup2
NON RATIO SUPPORT POSITIONS IN

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:24.239 region:rollup2
IN THAT APARTMENT.

01:32:22.604 --> 01:32:25.974 region:rollup2
OUR CURRENT POPULATION IS

01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:27.642 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE AROUND FORTY SEVEN

01:32:25.974 --> 01:32:29.411 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SO WHEN TALKING TRYING

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:30.545 region:rollup2
TO GET AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER. WE

01:32:29.411 --> 01:32:31.980 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT FIVE

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:33.581 region:rollup2
HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN NON SOME

01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:34.783 region:rollup2
NON RACIAL POSITIONS ARE SUPPORT

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.084 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

01:32:34.783 --> 01:32:38.019 region:rollup2
SO WERE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

01:32:36.084 --> 01:32:39.687 region:rollup2
FIFTY POSITIONS BELOW WHERE THE

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:41.489 region:rollup2
POPPY IF YOU COMPARE THOSE

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:45.293 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS ARM.

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:46.628 region:rollup2
TODAY SO BOMB.

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:48.463 region:rollup2
THE JUSTIFICATION SIMPLY HAS

01:32:46.628 --> 01:32:51.132 region:rollup2
PASSED AS THE PAROLE POPULATION

01:32:48.463 --> 01:32:52.467 region:rollup2
GROWS AS WE AB PAROLE AGENTS

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:54.169 region:rollup2
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT WORK THAT

01:32:52.467 --> 01:32:54.936 region:rollup2
GOES BEHIND THAT.

01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:56.337 region:rollup2
TO THE ALEJO'S.

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:58.139 region:rollup2
.

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:59.541 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION A RECOMMENDATION THAT

01:32:58.139 --> 01:33:01.176 region:rollup2
WE TURN ON RACIAL POSITIONS INTO

01:32:59.541 --> 01:33:03.478 region:rollup2
RATIO POSITIONS

01:33:01.176 --> 01:33:06.548 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THAT IS THAT IS ONE

01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:08.183 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO TO TO TO THIS. AYE

01:33:06.548 --> 01:33:09.818 region:rollup2
IT ALMOST PUTS US ON AUTOPILOT

01:33:08.183 --> 01:33:11.753 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS BUDGETING AND AND

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:13.021 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL GOES.

01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:14.823 region:rollup2
IT'S EASY TO DO WITH PAROLE

01:33:13.021 --> 01:33:16.324 region:rollup2
POSITIONS BECAUSE FOR EVERY

01:33:14.823 --> 01:33:18.326 region:rollup2
PAROLE  <u><c.green>YOU CAN YOU CAN</c></u>

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:19.561 region:rollup2
DETERMINE HOW MANY YOU UP FOR

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:20.161 region:rollup2
ALLEGIANCE YOU NEED.

01:33:19.561 --> 01:33:22.997 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:24.332 region:rollup2
VERY GOT MENU OF OF SUPPORT

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:25.667 region:rollup2
POSITIONS TO DEAL WITH THINGS

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:27.769 region:rollup2
LIKE WORKMEN'S COMP AND

01:33:25.667 --> 01:33:29.537 region:rollup2
BACKGROUNDS IN STAFF TRAINING IN

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:31.873 region:rollup2
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IT'S

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:33.074 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFICULT TO RATIO THOSE

01:33:31.873 --> 01:33:34.843 region:rollup2
KINDS OF POSITIONS

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:37.479 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY AS THINGS CHANGE

01:33:34.843 --> 01:33:39.781 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS CHANGE LAWS CHANGE.

01:33:37.479 --> 01:33:41.549 region:rollup2
EVEN AUTOMATION COMES ON BOARD

01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:43.351 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE RATIOS BECOME.

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:44.886 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARILY HIGH OR

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:46.488 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARILY LOW.

01:33:44.886 --> 01:33:47.655 region:rollup2
IN THAT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC

01:33:46.488 --> 01:33:49.891 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AND WE HAVE TO GO BACK

01:33:47.655 --> 01:33:51.993 region:rollup2
AND CONSTANTLY ADJUST THE RATIOS

01:33:49.891 --> 01:33:53.495 region:rollup2
OR IN MY EXPERIENCE OVER THIRTY

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:55.396 region:rollup2
PLUS YEARS WHAT WE DO IS WE

01:33:53.495 --> 01:33:56.498 region:rollup2
START SWAPPING. I'LL GIVE YOU UP

01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:57.599 region:rollup2
I'LL GIVE UP TO OF THESE

01:33:56.498 --> 01:33:59.234 region:rollup2
POSITIONS IN THE RATIO TO GET

01:33:57.599 --> 01:34:00.568 region:rollup2
ONE OF THESE.

01:33:59.234 --> 01:34:01.936 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE AS WE HAVE

01:34:00.568 --> 01:34:03.872 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY DID HIS IMPROVED FOR

01:34:01.936 --> 01:34:05.406 region:rollup2
MY PAROLE AGENTS.

01:34:03.872 --> 01:34:08.076 region:rollup2
WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED PEOPLE

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:09.878 region:rollup2
TO MANUALLY ENTER CASE NOTES AND

01:34:08.076 --> 01:34:11.479 region:rollup2
TO FILE THINGS BECAUSE NOW IT'S

01:34:09.878 --> 01:34:12.881 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:14.482 region:rollup2
THE BACKSIDE OF THAT IS WE NEED

01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:16.885 region:rollup2
MORE IT SUPPORT.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:18.453 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WHAT WE IF WE HAD RATIO

01:34:16.885 --> 01:34:19.754 region:rollup2
THOSE POSITIONS FIVE YEARS AGO

01:34:18.453 --> 01:34:21.289 region:rollup2
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:22.757 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TODAY.

01:34:21.289 --> 01:34:24.392 region:rollup2
SO BY US COMING TO YOU AND

01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:25.960 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR RATIO DIFFER

01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:26.861 region:rollup2
NONRACIAL POSITIONS WE REALLY

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.196 region:rollup2
YOU'RE JUST TO FIND THOSE

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:29.998 region:rollup2
POSITIONS BASED ON THE ACTUAL

01:34:28.196 --> 01:34:31.432 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD THAT WE SEE VERSUS SORT

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:32.300 region:rollup2
OF ON AUTOPILOT SORT OF

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:34.702 region:rollup2
BUDGETING.

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:35.737 region:rollup2
AND STAFF ALLOCATIONS

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:36.337 region:rollup2
SO I THOUGHT I'D CERTAINLY BE

01:34:35.737 --> 01:34:37.772 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.673 region:rollup2
YOU MAY HAVE.

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:40.875 region:rollup2
ANY COMMENTS ROOM FINANCE

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:42.377 region:rollup2
BELIAU.

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:44.178 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

01:34:45.713 --> 01:34:48.616 region:rollup2
AS THE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THEY

01:34:47.315 --> 01:34:50.051 region:rollup2
HAVE THEIR DIRECT SUPERVISION

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:51.452 region:rollup2
POSITIONS WHICH THEY ANNUALLY

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:52.720 region:rollup2
ADJUST IN THE BUDGET DEPENDING

01:34:51.452 --> 01:34:54.489 region:rollup2
ON.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.024 region:rollup2
THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE

01:34:54.489 --> 01:34:57.091 region:rollup2
PROBABLY POPULATION

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:58.326 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:59.861 region:rollup2
POSITIONS WHICH THEY HAVE

BASIS.

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:05.667 region:rollup2
SO WE RECOMMEND THE DEPARTMENT

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:08.102 region:rollup2
UTILIZE A RATIO DRIVEN APPROACH

01:35:05.667 --> 01:35:10.004 region:rollup2
FOR THE SUPPORT POSITIONS THAT

01:35:12.874 --> 01:35:15.677 region:rollup2
SUPERVISION AND THE SUPPORT

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:16.611 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

01:35:15.677 --> 01:35:18.413 region:rollup2
AND RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:19.981 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CDS YARD

01:35:18.413 --> 01:35:22.317 region:rollup2
REPORTED BUDGET HEARINGS ON A

01:35:19.981 --> 01:35:23.685 region:rollup2
PLAN TO INCORPORATE THESE

01:35:22.317 --> 01:35:25.620 region:rollup2
SUPPORT POSITIONS INTO THE

01:35:23.685 --> 01:35:27.488 region:rollup2
ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.

01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:28.923 region:rollup2
AN IMPENDING SUCH A REPORT AS

01:35:27.488 --> 01:35:30.992 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE UPDATED POPULATION

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:32.193 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS THAT COME WITH THE

01:35:30.992 --> 01:35:34.329 region:rollup2
MAY REVISION WE WITHHOLD

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:35.663 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION ON THE. RIVER

01:35:34.329 --> 01:35:37.699 region:rollup2
PACIFIC NUMBER OF POSITIONS

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:38.833 region:rollup2
REQUESTED BOTH ON THE DIRECT

SIDE.

01:35:40.335 --> 01:35:43.371 region:rollup2
AND WHILE IT IS CERTAINLY THE

01:35:41.603 --> 01:35:45.106 region:rollup2
CASE THAT THE SUPPORT POSITIONS

01:35:43.371 --> 01:35:47.242 region:rollup2
ARE NOT AS DIRECTLY TIED TO

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:49.344 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC CASELOADS AS YOUR

01:35:47.242 --> 01:35:50.178 region:rollup2
DIRECT SUPERVISION PRO AGENTS.

01:35:49.344 --> 01:35:51.980 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN APARTMENT INDICATED

01:35:50.178 --> 01:35:54.482 region:rollup2
THEY STILL ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES

01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:56.484 region:rollup2
IN THE PROPERLY POPULATION FOR

01:41:31.519 --> 01:41:34.121 region:rollup2
A LOWER LEVEL TO DINE ON AND THE

01:41:33.087 --> 01:41:36.090 region:rollup2
AND THE WHERE WERE FOCUSING

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:37.391 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR GRANTS

01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:39.126 region:rollup2
IS PROMISING PRACTICES.

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:40.361 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE NOT SIMILAR TO OUR

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:42.029 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES THAT

01:41:40.361 --> 01:41:43.731 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:45.099 region:rollup2
BUT HAVEN'T NECESSARILY BEEN

01:41:43.731 --> 01:41:46.901 region:rollup2
RIGOROUSLY RESEARCHED EVIDENCE

01:41:45.099 --> 01:41:48.736 region:rollup2
BASED SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS

01:41:46.901 --> 01:41:50.204 region:rollup2
TAKING SOME ELEMENTS OF THOSE.

01:41:48.736 --> 01:41:51.706 region:rollup2
I'M AND FOCUS IT ON THE

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:53.608 region:rollup2
CORRECTIONAL PROGRAM CHECKLIST

01:41:51.706 --> 01:41:54.775 region:rollup2

APPLICATION THAT GOES AN AFFRONT

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:57.178 region:rollup2
WE'VE BUILT IN KIND OF THOSE

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:59.180 region:rollup2
CHECKS AND BALANCES AFFRONT TO

01:41:57.178 --> 01:42:00.448 region:rollup2
GET APPLICANTS. THAT HAVE THOSE

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:02.383 region:rollup2
PROMISING PRACTICES KIND OF

01:42:00.448 --> 01:42:04.018 region:rollup2
BUILT INTO THE APPLICATIONS THAT

01:42:02.383 --> 01:42:05.286 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE RECEIVED AND

01:42:04.018 --> 01:42:05.786 region:rollup2
THEN SUBSEQUENTLY ALSO HOW WE

01:42:05.286 --> 01:42:06.954 region:rollup2
GREAT THOSE.

01:42:05.786 --> 01:42:09.357 region:rollup2
AND IN THE LATTER PORTION THE

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:10.624 region:rollup2
SECONDARY AND FINAL TIER OF OUR

01:42:09.357 --> 01:42:11.626 region:rollup2
GRANTS ARE THE THIRTY FIVE

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:13.260 region:rollup2
PERCENT THERE REALLY CAN'T

01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:14.795 region:rollup2
PRACTICE BASED GRANTS THOSE ARE.

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:17.198 region:rollup2
USING COMMON PRINCIPLES AND

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:18.199 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THAT ON MAY LEAD TO

01:42:17.198 --> 01:42:20.134 region:rollup2
PROMISING PRACTICES IN THE

01:42:18.199 --> 01:42:20.935 region:rollup2

THAT.

01:42:20.935 --> 01:42:23.871 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE A

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:25.506 region:rollup2
POSITIVE RESULT AND THAT STILL

01:42:23.871 --> 01:42:27.241 region:rollup2
ALLOWS TRUE INNOVATION IN OUR

01:42:25.506 --> 01:42:28.542 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH IS WHY WE

01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:30.311 region:rollup2

THE PAST AND PART OF THAT IS TO

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:15.523 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON PROGRAMS THAT HAVE.

01:43:14.422 --> 01:43:16.390 region:rollup2

CHECKLIST MENTION.

01:43:21.462 --> 01:43:24.532 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND RATHER THAN FOCUS

SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE GRANT

01:43:24.532 --> 01:43:28.302 region:rollup2

HUNDRED PER FOCUS UP ALL ONE

01:43:30.404 --> 01:43:32.506 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FUNDING.

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:33.908 region:rollup2
ON THOSE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:35.676 region:rollup2

STRATEGIES TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:41.148 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE

01:43:38.946 --> 01:43:42.850 region:rollup2
GREATEST IMPACT ON REDUCING

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:46.287 region:rollup2

THE BENEFITS TO THE STATE.

01:43:46.287 --> 01:43:48.689 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:43:47.588 --> 01:43:50.891 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:52.460 region:rollup2
FOCUS THEIR SCORING METHODOLOGY

WHICH IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:56.063 region:rollup2
ON RECIDIVISM REDUCTION MEANING

01:43:54.495 --> 01:43:58.532 region:rollup2
THAT RECIDIVISM REDUCTION WOULD

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:59.567 region:rollup2
BECOME THE TOP SCORING CRITERIA

01:43:58.532 --> 01:44:02.136 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:03.137 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK WHEN IT'S DEVELOPED

THEY COULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE.

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:34.068 region:rollup2
IN THE PRISONS USING OTHER

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.503 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF FUNDING WHICH IS%

01:44:34.068 --> 01:44:36.904 region:rollup2
HOW THEY WERE SOME OF THESE

PROGRAMS WERE FUNDED IN THE PAST

01:44:36.904 --> 01:44:39.874 region:rollup2
AS THEY WERE REQUIRED TO

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND.

01:44:54.488 --> 01:44:57.525 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS HAVE

01:44:55.890 --> 01:44:58.826 region:rollup2
BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM

01:44:57.525 --> 01:45:00.828 region:rollup2
IN THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS

01:44:58.826 --> 01:45:02.596 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAM IS TO TRULY ALLOW.

INTO THE PRESENCE WHO MAYBE

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:08.736 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T DEMONSTRATED THOSE.

01:45:07.835 --> 01:45:10.805 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T REACHED THAT LEVEL OF

01:45:08.736 --> 01:45:13.007 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE BASED.

01:45:10.805 --> 01:45:13.607 region:rollup2

01:45:13.007 --> 01:45:15.910 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:17.411 region:rollup2
A AYE I UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL BE

01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:19.713 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING TO ACCOMPLISH IN I

01:45:17.411 --> 01:45:21.515 region:rollup2
THINK GO OUR FOCUS SHOULD ALWAYS

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:23.150 region:rollup2
BEEN RECIDIVISM. AND THOSE

01:45:21.515 --> 01:45:23.717 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND I KNOW

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:25.219 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR INNOVATION ONCE

01:45:23.717 --> 01:45:28.088 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:45:25.219 --> 01:45:29.523 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY. MAYBE BEING. HAVING A

01:45:28.088 --> 01:45:30.658 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM OUGHT TO BE

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:32.626 region:rollup2
THERE BASIS BUT WHICH GIVING

01:45:30.658 --> 01:45:33.394 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR CONTINUING

01:45:32.626 --> 01:45:35.563 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING.

01:45:33.394 --> 01:45:36.564 region:rollup2
INNOVATION IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT

01:45:35.563 --> 01:45:37.998 region:rollup2
A BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE

01:45:36.564 --> 01:45:39.300 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THAT WE EVALUATE THOSE

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:41.669 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:42.269 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING FOR THEM SO WE DON'T

01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:43.971 region:rollup2
WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THAT I

01:45:42.269 --> 01:45:45.739 region:rollup2
THINK. BOTH OF YOU PROBABLY

01:45:43.971 --> 01:45:46.974 region:rollup2
GETTING AT THAT POINT AND SO I

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:48.409 region:rollup2
THINK WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT

01:45:46.974 --> 01:45:50.110 region:rollup2
TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT IT

01:45:48.409 --> 01:45:52.313 region:rollup2
CAN. DO THE COMPARISON A SIXTY

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:53.647 region:rollup2
FIVE TO A HUNDRED PERCENT IN

01:45:52.313 --> 01:45:55.082 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HOW WE'VE FUND PROGRAMS

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:56.450 region:rollup2
WHERE I THINK ANY CONTINUATION

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:58.485 region:rollup2
OF FUNDING. HAS TO BE BASED ON

01:45:56.450 --> 01:46:00.821 region:rollup2
THE STANDARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:45:58.485 --> 01:46:03.324 region:rollup2
DO THE JOB THAT WE SAY THEY'RE

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:05.559 region:rollup2
DOING OTHERWISE WE JUST GIVING

01:46:03.324 --> 01:46:07.494 region:rollup2
MONEY TO UP PROGRAMS AND

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:09.897 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY GROUPS. THAT MAY OR

01:46:07.494 --> 01:46:12.099 region:rollup2
MAY NOT AFFECT WHAT WE WANT

01:46:09.897 --> 01:46:13.767 region:rollup2
WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THE FOLKS

01:46:12.099 --> 01:46:17.304 region:rollup2
ARE NOT COMING BACK AND TO GIVE

01:46:13.767 --> 01:46:18.839 region:rollup2
THEM THE SKILLS AND THE. SOFT

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:19.473 region:rollup2
SKILLS AND HARD SKILLS AS WELL

WITH YOU AND THE DIVISION. AND I

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.223 region:rollup2
THINK WE AGREE WITH THE LA WAS

IS REALLY BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP

01:46:41.562 --> 01:46:47.201 region:rollup2
A SCORING CRITERIA BOTH.

01:46:45.099 --> 01:46:50.671 region:rollup2
IN THE END WHEN WE'RE AWARDING

01:46:47.201 --> 01:46:53.707 region:rollup2
GRANTS TO FOCUS ON THOSE EXACT

01:46:50.671 --> 01:46:55.609 region:rollup2
FACTORS AS MORE INFORMATION

ITS FINALITY IN TERMS OF

THE IF THE PROPOSAL NEARLY SIX

01:53:35.042 --> 01:53:37.944 region:rollup2
TO CREATE PARITY BETWEEN THE

CHAIR WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS

01:53:51.525 --> 01:53:55.462 region:rollup2
WITH THIS PROPOSAL.

01:53:53.126 --> 01:53:57.898 region:rollup2
FIRST WE THINK IT'S UNCLEAR HOW

01:53:55.462 --> 01:53:59.833 region:rollup2
IT WILL REDUCE VACANCIES AN

01:53:57.898 --> 01:54:02.636 region:rollup2
INMATE FACILITY MAINTENANCE

01:53:59.833 --> 01:54:04.504 region:rollup2
WORKER POSITIONS AND AND. THIS

01:54:02.636 --> 01:54:06.873 region:rollup2
IS FOR TWO REASONS FIRST.

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:09.843 region:rollup2
AS THE ADMINISTRATION MENTIONED.

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:11.611 region:rollup2
INMATES NPI AND IWL POSITIONS

01:54:09.843 --> 01:54:13.380 region:rollup2
ALREADY RECEIVE OTHER NON PAY

01:54:11.611 --> 01:54:14.481 region:rollup2
BENEFITS SETS SO DOESN'T APPEAR

01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:16.350 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD NECESSARILY BE

01:54:14.481 --> 01:54:18.518 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ATTRACT INMATES AWAY

01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:19.319 region:rollup2
FROM THOSE POSITIONS. SECOND

01:54:18.518 --> 01:54:22.589 region:rollup2
INMATES ENGAGED.

01:54:19.319 --> 01:54:25.092 region:rollup2
IN OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITIES.

01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:27.728 region:rollup2
BESIDES AND IWL.

01:54:25.092 --> 01:54:29.162 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY THERE SIT GIVEN THAT

01:54:27.728 --> 01:54:30.364 region:rollup2
THERE'S A THIRTY PERCENT VACANCY

01:54:29.162 --> 01:54:31.732 region:rollup2
RATE IN CAL PA POSITIONS WHICH

01:54:30.364 --> 01:54:34.201 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY OFFER THE HIGHER WAGES

01:54:31.732 --> 01:54:34.768 region:rollup2
AND THEN ADDITIONAL NON PAY

01:54:34.201 --> 01:54:36.236 region:rollup2
BENEFITS. IT DOESN'T APPEAR

01:54:34.768 --> 01:54:37.170 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:54:36.236 --> 01:54:39.439 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE WAGES IS AN

01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:41.241 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY TO ATTRACT

01:54:39.439 --> 01:54:43.310 region:rollup2
OTHER INMATES WERE ENGAGED IN.

01:54:41.241 --> 01:54:44.911 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER ACTIVITIES WHILE

01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:46.580 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED INTO.

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:48.515 region:rollup2
THESE HIGHER PAYING JOBS THAT

01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:50.917 region:rollup2
USED A SIMILAR SKILLSET ADDS

01:54:48.515 --> 01:54:54.387 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES I'M

01:54:50.917 --> 01:54:56.256 region:rollup2
FOR THE PLANT. MATT MAINTENANCE

01:54:54.387 --> 01:54:58.925 region:rollup2
INMATE WORKERS.

01:54:56.256 --> 01:55:00.761 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IF THE PROPOSAL IS

01:54:58.925 --> 01:55:02.763 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE IN ATTRACTING INMATES

01:55:00.761 --> 01:55:10.370 region:rollup2
INTO THOSE POSITIONS.

01:55:02.763 --> 01:55:12.639 region:rollup2
IT COULD HAVE SOME UNINTENDED

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:13.306 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES DEPENDING ON WHERE

01:55:12.639 --> 01:55:14.708 region:rollup2
IT'S ATTRACTING INMATES FROM AND

01:55:13.306 --> 01:55:15.976 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE

01:55:14.708 --> 01:55:16.943 region:rollup2
DOING WITH THEIR TIME.

01:55:15.976 --> 01:55:17.544 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE A COULD INCREASE

01:55:16.943 --> 01:55:18.178 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OUTLAY COST TO THE

01:55:17.544 --> 01:55:20.313 region:rollup2
EXTENTIT ATTRACTS INMATES AWAY

01:55:18.178 --> 01:55:21.148 region:rollup2
FROM IWL PROJECTS REQUIRING THE

01:55:20.313 --> 01:55:23.583 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO.

01:55:21.148 --> 01:55:25.418 region:rollup2
USE. NON INMATE LABOR AT A

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:26.820 region:rollup2
HIGHER COST TO COMPLETE ITS

01:55:25.418 --> 01:55:28.622 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS.

01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:30.957 region:rollup2
IT COULD INCREASE PURCHASING

01:55:28.622 --> 01:55:32.426 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR CDC OUR AND OTHER

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:33.427 region:rollup2
STATE DEPARTMENTS TO THE EXTENT

01:55:32.426 --> 01:55:37.097 region:rollup2
IT. I REDUCES INMATE LABOR

01:55:33.427 --> 01:55:39.032 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO P. I A AND IN TURN

01:55:37.097 --> 01:55:40.734 region:rollup2
REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF GOODS PA

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:41.635 region:rollup2
IS ABLE TO PRODUCE WHICH IN TURN

01:55:40.734 --> 01:55:43.470 region:rollup2
REQUIRES WOULD MEAN THAT THE

01:55:41.635 --> 01:55:45.272 region:rollup2
STATE. WOULD POTENTIALLY BE

01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:46.773 region:rollup2
PURCHASING PRODUCTS AT HIGHER

01:55:45.272 --> 01:55:47.908 region:rollup2
COST FROM OTHER SUPPLIERS.

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:49.976 region:rollup2
AND TO THE EXTENT IT ATTRACTS

01:55:47.908 --> 01:55:51.378 region:rollup2
INMATES AWAY FROM OTHER USES OF

01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:52.779 region:rollup2
THEIR TIME THAT ARE MORE

01:55:51.378 --> 01:55:54.614 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:59.786 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO WORKING IN A PLANT

01:55:54.614 --> 01:56:00.253 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS. POSITION IT COULD

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:02.656 region:rollup2
INCREASE RECIDIVISM.

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:04.624 region:rollup2
I AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT.

01:56:02.656 --> 01:56:08.495 region:rollup2
IT ATTRACTS INMATES FROM OTHER

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:09.963 region:rollup2
USES OF THEIR TIME THAT.

01:56:08.495 --> 01:56:13.600 region:rollup2
WOULD RESULT IN THEM EARNING

01:56:09.963 --> 01:56:14.568 region:rollup2
MILESTONE CREDITS IT COULD

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:17.270 region:rollup2
RESULT IN SOME INMATES SPENDING

01:56:14.568 --> 01:56:19.105 region:rollup2
MORE TIME IN PRISON WHICH IN

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:20.207 region:rollup2
TURN WOULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR

01:56:19.105 --> 01:56:21.608 region:rollup2
STATE COSTS.

01:56:20.207 --> 01:56:22.576 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

01:56:21.608 --> 01:56:23.476 region:rollup2
FINALLY.

01:56:22.576 --> 01:56:25.812 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:56:23.476 --> 01:56:26.480 region:rollup2
HAS INDICATED THAT IT IT ALSO

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:28.315 region:rollup2
HAS

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:29.015 region:rollup2
FACE CHALLENGES IN RECRUITING

01:56:28.315 --> 01:56:31.685 region:rollup2
CIVIL SERVICE WORKERS FOR

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:32.619 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE.

01:56:31.685 --> 01:56:35.088 region:rollup2
.

01:56:32.619 --> 01:56:38.024 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

01:56:35.088 --> 01:56:39.626 region:rollup2
HOWEVER SO AT THIS POINT IT'S

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:41.294 region:rollup2
STILL UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT THE

01:56:39.626 --> 01:56:41.928 region:rollup2
BACKLOG THAT IS SITE IS THAT THE

01:56:41.294 --> 01:56:42.562 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE BACKLOG THAT CITED

01:56:41.928 --> 01:56:44.264 region:rollup2
AS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM HERE.

01:56:42.562 --> 01:56:44.865 region:rollup2
IS

01:56:44.264 --> 01:56:47.367 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BY

01:56:44.865 --> 01:56:48.235 region:rollup2
THIS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION

01:56:47.367 --> 01:56:49.002 region:rollup2
DOLLAR REQUEST GIVEN IT'S

01:56:48.235 --> 01:56:49.936 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT THAT

01:56:49.002 --> 01:56:50.837 region:rollup2
BACKLOG IS DUE TO CIVIL SERVICE

01:56:49.936 --> 01:56:51.505 region:rollup2

INMATE WORKER VACANCIES.

01:56:51.505 --> 01:56:53.807 region:rollup2
SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

WITHHOLD ACTION AND DIRECT THE

01:56:53.807 --> 01:57:00.347 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON WHY

01:56:56.309 --> 01:57:01.748 region:rollup2
IT THINKS OPPOSE WAGING INCREASE

01:57:00.347 --> 01:57:02.582 region:rollup2
WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING

01:57:01.748 --> 01:57:03.183 region:rollup2
FACILITY MAINTENANCE AND AND

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:04.951 region:rollup2
REDUCING FACILITY MAINTENANCE

HERE.

01:57:07.087 --> 01:57:10.757 region:rollup2
HOW IT PLANS TO MITIGATE

01:57:09.823 --> 01:57:11.892 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:13.693 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROPOSAL

WORKER VACANCIES.

01:57:23.937 --> 01:57:27.073 region:rollup2
HOW CDC ARE HAS SPENT THE

01:57:25.472 --> 01:57:28.041 region:rollup2
SAVINGS FROM THOSE VACANCIES AND

01:57:27.073 --> 01:57:29.476 region:rollup2

TAKING A LOOK AT THE.

YOUNG ADULTS BRAIN IS NOT YOU

SPECIFICALLY THAT AREA THAT.

02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:32.418 region:rollup2
ARE THOSE ADULT FUNCTIONS IN

TOOK A LOOK AT.

THE AGED JURISDICTION.

TIME THAT HE YOUTH.

02:11:41.427 --> 02:11:45.765 region:rollup2
CAN STAY IN DJJ AND AFTER

02:11:44.230 --> 02:11:48.567 region:rollup2
HEARING SOME CONCERNS WITH

02:11:45.765 --> 02:11:50.503 region:rollup2
REGARD TO THE TRANSFER PROCESS.

IN THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN RELATED

02:11:50.503 --> 02:11:55.441 region:rollup2
HEARINGS THAT THE AGE OF

02:11:52.972 --> 02:11:56.509 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION AS CURRENTLY SET AT

02:11:55.441 --> 02:11:59.879 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE.

02:11:56.509 --> 02:12:00.479 region:rollup2
DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH TIME

02:11:59.879 --> 02:12:02.782 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:12:00.479 --> 02:12:03.849 region:rollup2
OLDER YOUNG ADULTS SO TO SPEAK

02:12:02.782 --> 02:12:06.252 region:rollup2
COMING INTO THE TRANSFER

02:12:03.849 --> 02:12:07.253 region:rollup2
HEARINGS TO BE ABLE TO MEET THAT

02:12:06.252 --> 02:12:09.321 region:rollup2
FACTOR WITH REGARD TO.

02:12:07.253 --> 02:12:10.856 region:rollup2
TIME TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:12.425 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION IF THEY'RE

02:12:10.856 --> 02:12:14.360 region:rollup2
AMENABLE TO IT.

02:12:12.425 --> 02:12:16.862 region:rollup2
AND THAT IF WE WERE TO RAISE THE

02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:18.631 region:rollup2
AGE OF JURISDICTION BACK TO THE

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:20.299 region:rollup2
AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. THAT WE

02:12:18.631 --> 02:12:22.802 region:rollup2
WOULD SEE A GREATER NUMBER OF

02:12:20.299 --> 02:12:25.337 region:rollup2
YOUNG ADULTS ADJUDICATED TO DJJ

02:12:22.802 --> 02:12:25.871 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN CONVICTED. AS ADULTS

02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:27.973 region:rollup2
AND HAVING TO GO TO ADULT

02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:30.576 region:rollup2
PRISON.

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:33.279 region:rollup2
AND CONTINUING WITH THAT LINE OF

02:12:30.576 --> 02:12:34.280 region:rollup2
REASONING IN THAT.

02:12:33.279 --> 02:12:35.781 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A FEW THE CURRENT

02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:38.417 region:rollup2
PRACTICES IS THAT YOUNG ADULTS

02:12:35.781 --> 02:12:40.319 region:rollup2
WHO DO END UP CONVICTED.

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:41.487 region:rollup2
AS ADULTS USE JUVENILES

02:12:40.319 --> 02:12:44.290 region:rollup2
CONVICTED AS ADULTS.

02:12:41.487 --> 02:12:46.592 region:rollup2
COME TO DJJ AND IF THEY ARE NOT

02:12:44.290 --> 02:12:48.327 region:rollup2
ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR TERM.

02:12:46.592 --> 02:12:50.763 region:rollup2
ADULT TERM PRIOR TO THE AGE OF

02:12:48.327 --> 02:12:52.465 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE WE'RE REQUIRED BY LAW

02:12:50.763 --> 02:12:53.966 region:rollup2
TO TRANSFER THEM OVER TO THE

02:12:52.465 --> 02:12:55.034 region:rollup2
ADULT SIDE TO COMPLETE THEIR

02:12:53.966 --> 02:12:56.969 region:rollup2
TERM.

02:12:55.034 --> 02:12:59.405 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING IS

02:12:56.969 --> 02:13:00.806 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE ABLE TO KEEP YEARS

02:12:59.405 --> 02:13:03.042 region:rollup2
WHO ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR

02:13:00.806 --> 02:13:04.476 region:rollup2
TERM. PRIOR TO TURNING TO THE

02:13:03.042 --> 02:13:05.678 region:rollup2
EIGHT TO TWENTY FIVE.

02:13:04.476 --> 02:13:07.146 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT UPON THE JURORS GOING

02:13:05.678 --> 02:13:08.447 region:rollup2
BACK TO TWENTY FIVE.

02:13:07.146 --> 02:13:09.148 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE ABLE TO COMPLETE

02:13:08.447 --> 02:13:10.583 region:rollup2
THEIR ADULT TERM PRIOR TO

02:13:09.148 --> 02:13:12.451 region:rollup2
TURNING THE TWENTY FIVE THAT

02:13:10.583 --> 02:13:14.420 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO STAY. IN

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:16.155 region:rollup2
DJJ AND BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM

02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:17.423 region:rollup2
AND RATHER THAN GOING OVER TO

02:13:16.155 --> 02:13:18.824 region:rollup2
THE ADULT SIDE.

02:13:17.423 --> 02:13:20.292 region:rollup2
THEN FINALLY CONTINUE WITHOUT

02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:21.760 region:rollup2
LINE OF REASONING THE THOUGHT

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:24.129 region:rollup2
WAS THAT PERHAPS THERE'S A

02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:26.365 region:rollup2
POPULATION OF YOUNG ADULTS WHO

02:13:24.129 --> 02:13:28.200 region:rollup2
WERE CONVICTED BETWEEN THE AGES

02:13:26.365 --> 02:13:29.835 region:rollup2
OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE. WHO

02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:31.170 region:rollup2
ALSO COULD COMPLETE THEIR TERM

02:13:29.835 --> 02:13:33.372 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO TURNING THE AGED TWENTY

02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:35.808 region:rollup2
FIVE WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM

02:13:33.372 --> 02:13:38.377 region:rollup2
COMING TO DJ J. RATHER THAN

02:13:35.808 --> 02:13:39.979 region:rollup2
HAVING TO GO TO? ADULT PRISON.

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:41.881 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE THE THREE PROPOSAL

02:13:39.979 --> 02:13:43.382 region:rollup2
SO TO SPEAK FOR AYE IN THE

02:13:41.881 --> 02:13:45.050 region:rollup2
RATIONALE BEHIND THEM.

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:46.919 region:rollup2
VETERAN KATE CONTAINED IN THE

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:49.255 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

02:13:46.919 --> 02:13:52.224 region:rollup2
ANYONE FROM FINANCE.

02:13:49.255 --> 02:13:53.492 region:rollup2
THOMAS BELIAU.

02:13:52.224 --> 02:13:55.694 region:rollup2
DID YOU START WORK LEGISLATIVE

02:13:53.492 --> 02:13:57.263 region:rollup2
ANALYST'S OFFICE ON OVERALL WE

02:13:55.694 --> 02:13:58.564 region:rollup2
FIND THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:13:57.263 --> 02:14:00.266 region:rollup2
PROPOSED CHANGES PROMISING

02:13:58.564 --> 02:14:01.967 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AS I WILL DISCUSS IN

02:14:00.266 --> 02:14:04.069 region:rollup2
GREATER DETAIL WE DO RECOMMEND

02:14:01.967 --> 02:14:05.104 region:rollup2
MODIFYING THEM TO ADDRESS SOME.

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:07.706 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY UNINTENDED

02:14:05.104 --> 02:14:09.608 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES APPROVING THAT

02:14:07.706 --> 02:14:12.044 region:rollup2
CHANGES ON ONLY A LIMITED TERM

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:13.646 region:rollup2
BASIS. AND DIRECTING DE GJ TO

02:14:12.044 --> 02:14:14.613 region:rollup2
CONDUCT SOME SPECIFIC

02:14:13.646 --> 02:14:16.181 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS.

02:14:14.613 --> 02:14:18.150 region:rollup2
FIRST WE FIND THE PROPOSED

02:14:16.181 --> 02:14:19.251 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO INCREASE DE JJ'S AGE

02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:21.954 region:rollup2
OF JURISDICTION TO.

02:14:19.251 --> 02:14:25.658 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PROMISING AS IT

02:14:21.954 --> 02:14:25.658 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKELY REDUCE THE NUMBER

02:14:25.724 --> 02:14:29.061 region:rollup2
ADULT COURT THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN

02:14:27.526 --> 02:14:30.696 region:rollup2
JUDGES ARE CONDUCTING TRANSFER

02:14:29.061 --> 02:14:32.364 region:rollup2
HEARINGS ONE OF THE THINGS THEY

02:14:30.696 --> 02:14:33.699 region:rollup2
CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER

02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:35.734 region:rollup2
TRANSFER YOUTH IS THE AMOUNT OF

02:14:33.699 --> 02:14:37.770 region:rollup2
TIME DJJ HAS TO REHABILITATE

02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:39.505 region:rollup2
THESE YOU.

02:14:37.770 --> 02:14:41.607 region:rollup2
ARM IN ADDITION RESEARCH DOES

02:14:39.505 --> 02:14:43.208 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT YOUTHS WHO REMAIN IN

02:14:41.607 --> 02:14:44.677 region:rollup2
JUVENILE COURT RATHER THAN BEING

02:14:43.208 --> 02:14:46.612 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT

02:14:44.677 --> 02:14:48.047 region:rollup2
GENERALLY HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES.

02:14:46.612 --> 02:14:49.748 region:rollup2
MOREOVER DESPITE THE FACT THAT

02:14:48.047 --> 02:14:52.017 region:rollup2
IT ROUGHLY EIGHTY THOUSAND

02:14:49.748 --> 02:14:53.385 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER YEAR PER YEAR DJJ IS

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:54.987 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:57.189 region:rollup2
THE ADULT SIDE WHICH COSTS ABOUT

02:14:54.987 --> 02:14:59.091 region:rollup2
THIRTY THOUSAND PER INMATE PER

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:59.592 region:rollup2
YEAR HOUSED IN A CONTRACT BAD.

02:14:59.091 --> 02:15:01.260 region:rollup2
JUVENILE COURT TERMS ARE

02:14:59.592 --> 02:15:02.828 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SHORT ENOUGH THAT IN

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:04.530 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CASES THEY CAN BE LESS

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:06.966 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE THAN COMMITTING AN

02:15:04.530 --> 02:15:08.300 region:rollup2
ADULT TO A LONGER A DART.

02:15:06.966 --> 02:15:09.201 region:rollup2
COMMITTING A YOU TO A LONGER

02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:10.703 region:rollup2
ADULT SENTENCE.

02:15:09.201 --> 02:15:12.271 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE JUVENILE COURT USE

02:15:10.703 --> 02:15:13.606 region:rollup2
RELEASE FROM DJJ IN TWENTY

02:15:12.271 --> 02:15:16.208 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN SPEND AN AVERAGE OF

02:15:13.606 --> 02:15:17.543 region:rollup2
AROUND THREE YEARS IN DJJ. WHILE

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:19.345 region:rollup2
ADULT COURT USE WHO'D BEEN SENT

02:15:17.543 --> 02:15:21.747 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO THE STATE PRISON

02:15:19.345 --> 02:15:23.282 region:rollup2
SPACE SYSTEM SPEND ABOUT NINE

02:15:21.747 --> 02:15:24.850 region:rollup2
YEARS IN PRISON.

02:15:23.282 --> 02:15:26.218 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:27.519 region:rollup2
SOME YOUTH WHO ARE CURRENTLY

02:15:26.218 --> 02:15:29.655 region:rollup2
RELEASED AT TWENTY THREE NOW

02:15:27.519 --> 02:15:31.623 region:rollup2
WOULD END UP STAYING OUT FOR AS

02:15:29.655 --> 02:15:33.292 region:rollup2
MUCH AS TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS. WE

02:15:31.623 --> 02:15:34.793 region:rollup2
VIEW THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE

02:15:33.292 --> 02:15:36.562 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SIMPLY%

02:15:34.793 --> 02:15:38.197 region:rollup2
KEEPING YOUTH AND REHABILITATION

02:15:36.562 --> 02:15:39.999 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF

02:15:38.197 --> 02:15:41.934 region:rollup2
TIME THAN AVERAGE. DOESN'T

02:15:39.999 --> 02:15:42.901 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

02:15:41.934 --> 02:15:43.569 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS.

02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:45.504 region:rollup2
BUT WE FIND THAT THE

02:15:43.569 --> 02:15:47.239 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S TO PROPOSALS TO

02:15:45.504 --> 02:15:49.274 region:rollup2
ALLOW ADULT COURT USED TO STAY

02:15:47.239 --> 02:15:50.776 region:rollup2
IN BJJ UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY

02:15:49.274 --> 02:15:52.678 region:rollup2
FIVE TO BE PROMISING. AS

02:15:50.776 --> 02:15:54.213 region:rollup2
RESEARCH DONE IN CALIFORNIA DID

02:15:52.678 --> 02:15:56.849 region:rollup2
SH SUGGESTS THAT YOUTH WHO ARE

02:15:54.213 --> 02:15:58.984 region:rollup2
KEPT IN DJJ RATHER THAN SENT TO

02:15:56.849 --> 02:15:59.885 region:rollup2
ADULT PRISON SHE ARM HAD BETTER

02:15:58.984 --> 02:16:02.154 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

02:15:59.885 --> 02:16:03.088 region:rollup2
HOWEVER BECAUSE DJJ AS I

02:16:02.154 --> 02:16:05.190 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER IS QUITE A BIT

02:16:03.088 --> 02:16:06.825 region:rollup2
MORE EXPENSIVE IT'S NOT CLEAR

02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:10.195 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS IS A COST EFFECTIVE

02:16:06.825 --> 02:16:11.296 region:rollup2
WAY OF REHABILITATING THESE YOU.

02:16:10.195 --> 02:16:12.297 region:rollup2
AREN'T WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED

02:16:11.296 --> 02:16:14.566 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A LACK OF

02:16:12.297 --> 02:16:16.535 region:rollup2
EVALUATION OF HOW EFFECTIVE DO

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:18.837 region:rollup2
YOU JJ'S PROGRAMS ARE. FOR

02:16:16.535 --> 02:16:20.706 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WELL DJJ GENERALLY DOES

02:16:18.837 --> 02:16:22.708 region:rollup2
BASE ITS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS

02:16:20.706 --> 02:16:24.343 region:rollup2
ON MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN

02:16:22.708 --> 02:16:26.578 region:rollup2
TO BE EFFECTIVE ELSEWHERE. ARM

02:16:24.343 --> 02:16:28.614 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT CURRENTLY ASSESSING

02:16:26.578 --> 02:16:30.749 region:rollup2
ITS PROGRAMS WITH TOOLS KNOWN AS

02:16:28.614 --> 02:16:31.984 region:rollup2
FIDELITY ASSESSMENTS TO ASSESS

02:16:30.749 --> 02:16:33.719 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING

02:16:31.984 --> 02:16:34.820 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES AS THEY ROLL

02:16:33.719 --> 02:16:37.456 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAMS OUT THOUGH THEY

02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:39.458 region:rollup2
WILL BEGIN DOING SO NEXT YEAR.

02:16:37.456 --> 02:16:41.026 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION DJJ IS NOT PLANNING

02:16:39.458 --> 02:16:43.028 region:rollup2
ON RELEASING AN OVERALL

02:16:41.026 --> 02:16:44.630 region:rollup2
EVALUATION OF THE A ACTUAL

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:45.664 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS PROGRAMS

02:16:44.630 --> 02:16:47.032 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN

02:16:45.664 --> 02:16:49.101 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

02:16:47.032 --> 02:16:50.502 region:rollup2
FINALLY DESPITE OPERA POSING THE

02:16:49.101 --> 02:16:52.304 region:rollup2
YOUNG ADULT OFFENDER PROGRAM AS

02:16:50.502 --> 02:16:54.339 region:rollup2
A PILOT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:16:52.304 --> 02:16:56.341 region:rollup2
NOT PROPOSING AN INDEPENDENT

02:16:54.339 --> 02:16:58.210 region:rollup2
EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM'S COST

02:16:56.341 --> 02:17:00.446 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS. AND IS PROPOSING

02:16:58.210 --> 02:17:01.980 region:rollup2
ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM

02:17:00.446 --> 02:17:03.649 region:rollup2
THESE FACTORS MAKE IT DIFFICULT

02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:05.417 region:rollup2
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS

02:17:03.649 --> 02:17:07.319 region:rollup2
WHETHER DJJ WILL BE ABLE TO

02:17:05.417 --> 02:17:08.587 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY REHABILITATE THE

02:17:07.319 --> 02:17:09.922 region:rollup2
YOUTH. THAT THEY WOULD BECOME

02:17:08.587 --> 02:17:11.090 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR AS A RESULT THE

02:17:09.922 --> 02:17:12.558 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

02:17:11.090 --> 02:17:14.193 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS

02:17:12.558 --> 02:17:16.995 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

02:17:14.193 --> 02:17:19.832 region:rollup2
FIRST WE RECOMMEND ONLY

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:21.433 region:rollup2
APPROVING THESE POLICY CHANGES

02:17:19.832 --> 02:17:22.501 region:rollup2
FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME SUCH

02:17:21.433 --> 02:17:23.635 region:rollup2
AS SEVEN YEARS AS THIS WOULD

02:17:22.501 --> 02:17:25.604 region:rollup2
ALLOW THESE CHANGES TO GOING TO

02:17:23.635 --> 02:17:26.371 region:rollup2
A FACT. AND PROVIDE TIME FOR

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:27.272 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOU ASIAN.

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:29.508 region:rollup2
SECOND WE RECOMMEND THAT DJJ

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:32.010 region:rollup2
REQUIRE EXCUSE ME THAT THE

02:17:29.508 --> 02:17:35.380 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE REQUIRED DJJ TO

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:36.515 region:rollup2
CONTRACT FOR AN INDEPENDENT

02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:37.116 region:rollup2
EVALUATION OF THE YOUNG ADULT

02:17:36.515 --> 02:17:38.751 region:rollup2
OFFENDER PROGRAM. AND DIRECT

02:17:37.116 --> 02:17:40.886 region:rollup2
THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED TO

02:17:38.751 --> 02:17:43.355 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE BY JANUARY TEN

02:17:40.886 --> 02:17:44.890 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE NOTE THAT

02:17:43.355 --> 02:17:45.424 region:rollup2
THIS COULD POSSIBLY COST AROUND

02:17:44.890 --> 02:17:46.325 region:rollup2
A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:17:45.424 --> 02:17:47.392 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

02:17:46.325 --> 02:17:49.261 region:rollup2
IN THE MEANTIME WHILE THE

02:17:47.392 --> 02:17:49.928 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S WAITING FOR THE

02:17:49.261 --> 02:17:53.165 region:rollup2
OUTCOME OF THIS VALUATION WE'D

02:17:49.928 --> 02:17:55.734 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND DIRECTING DJJ TO

02:17:53.165 --> 02:17:56.268 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE

02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:57.236 region:rollup2
OUTCOME OF ITS FIDELITY

02:17:56.268 --> 02:17:59.638 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS IN ITS OVERALL

02:17:57.236 --> 02:18:01.673 region:rollup2
PROGRAM EVALUATION.

02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:02.808 region:rollup2
FINALLY WE RECOMMEND MODIFYING

02:18:01.673 --> 02:18:05.010 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSED CHANGE TO DO JJ'S

02:18:02.808 --> 02:18:06.979 region:rollup2
AGE OF JURISDICTION.

02:18:05.010 --> 02:18:08.313 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT COULD NEGATIVELY

02:18:06.979 --> 02:18:09.915 region:rollup2
AFFECT SOME YOUTH AS I MENTIONED

02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:11.350 region:rollup2
EARLIER SPECIFICALLY WE'D

02:18:09.915 --> 02:18:16.255 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND PROVIDING JUVENILE

02:18:11.350 --> 02:18:18.223 region:rollup2
COURT JUDGES WITH THE.

02:18:16.255 --> 02:18:19.358 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY WHEN THEY'RE

02:18:18.223 --> 02:18:19.925 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING OUR TRANSFER HEARINGS

02:18:19.358 --> 02:18:21.894 region:rollup2
TO.

02:18:19.925 --> 02:18:23.829 region:rollup2
ALLOW YOU TO STAY IN BJJ UPS THE

02:18:21.894 --> 02:18:25.097 region:rollup2
AGE OF TWENTY FIVE ONLY IN CASES

02:18:23.829 --> 02:18:28.167 region:rollup2
WHERE THE JUDGE DETERMINES THAT

02:18:25.097 --> 02:18:28.967 region:rollup2
NOT DOING SO WOULD NECESSITATE

02:18:28.167 --> 02:18:31.503 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRING THE YOUTH TO ADULT

02:18:28.967 --> 02:18:32.704 region:rollup2
COURT. WE THINK THAT THIS WOULD

02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:33.639 region:rollup2
PREVENT THESE YOUTH FROM GOING

02:18:32.704 --> 02:18:35.808 region:rollup2
TO ADULT COURT WITHOUT

02:18:33.639 --> 02:18:37.509 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARILY AFFECTING YOU

02:18:35.808 --> 02:18:38.010 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR RD IN DJJ.

02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:40.179 region:rollup2
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

02:18:38.010 --> 02:18:42.381 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

02:18:40.179 --> 02:18:44.650 region:rollup2
ANY.

02:18:42.381 --> 02:18:47.152 region:rollup2
MANY QUESTIONS APPEAR YES.

02:18:44.650 --> 02:18:47.686 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND JUST

02:18:47.152 --> 02:18:48.854 region:rollup2
TO FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:49.454 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED

02:18:48.854 --> 02:18:51.089 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS ISSUE A LITTLE BIT

02:18:49.454 --> 02:18:54.927 region:rollup2
AND.

02:18:51.089 --> 02:18:55.427 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S.

02:18:54.927 --> 02:18:57.429 region:rollup2
DEATHLY GOING THE RIGHT

02:18:55.427 --> 02:18:58.463 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

02:18:57.429 --> 02:19:01.600 region:rollup2
THERE WAS GOING TO BE IN THE

02:18:58.463 --> 02:19:06.805 region:rollup2
DETAILS OF OF HOW THIS WORKS.

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:08.006 region:rollup2
AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE NOT.

02:19:06.805 --> 02:19:09.474 region:rollup2
TAKING OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD THESE

02:19:08.006 --> 02:19:10.909 region:rollup2
YOUTH LONGER THAN NECESSARY WAR.

02:19:09.474 --> 02:19:13.212 region:rollup2
INTERFERING WITH THE ABILITY FOR

02:19:10.909 --> 02:19:14.513 region:rollup2
THEM TO GO BACK TO THEIR

02:19:13.212 --> 02:19:15.080 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WHICH IS WHERE. THEY

02:19:14.513 --> 02:19:16.081 region:rollup2
ARE CLOSE TO THEIR FAMILY

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:17.249 region:rollup2
FRIENDS AND AND.

02:19:16.081 --> 02:19:18.517 region:rollup2
THE STRUCTURE THAT THEY'RE GOING

02:19:17.249 --> 02:19:20.252 region:rollup2
TO NEED WHEN THEY COME OUT.

02:19:18.517 --> 02:19:21.486 region:rollup2
THE THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT

02:19:20.252 --> 02:19:22.521 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE COST AND I THINK

02:19:21.486 --> 02:19:23.155 region:rollup2
THAT THIS PROVIDES US AN

02:19:22.521 --> 02:19:24.923 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY REALLY FILLED OUT

02:19:23.155 --> 02:19:27.659 region:rollup2
AND LOOK AT THE PROGRAMMING THAT

02:19:24.923 --> 02:19:29.027 region:rollup2
DJJ HAS BEEN DOING. BECAUSE IF

02:19:27.659 --> 02:19:30.295 region:rollup2
THE COST IS HIGHER KEEPING THEM

02:19:29.027 --> 02:19:31.663 region:rollup2
IN DJJ RATHER THAN GOING TO THE

02:19:30.295 --> 02:19:33.398 region:rollup2
DOE PRESIDENT THE REASON FOR

02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:35.634 region:rollup2
THAT. IS THE PROGRAMMING

02:19:33.398 --> 02:19:36.401 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION.

02:19:35.634 --> 02:19:39.137 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THE

02:19:36.401 --> 02:19:40.505 region:rollup2
RATE OF RECIDIVISM THAN I'VE.

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:43.976 region:rollup2
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF NOW THE SO

02:19:40.505 --> 02:19:45.177 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE I THINK THAT'S A

02:19:43.976 --> 02:19:45.677 region:rollup2
GREAT INVESTMENT THAT WE COULD

02:19:45.177 --> 02:19:48.513 region:rollup2
BE MAKING IN THOSE YOU.

02:19:45.677 --> 02:19:49.781 region:rollup2
SO LOOKING AT THE.

02:19:48.513 --> 02:19:50.616 region:rollup2
THE DETAILS OF OF HOW THIS WOULD

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:52.951 region:rollup2
BE IMPLEMENTED MAKE SURE THAT

02:19:50.616 --> 02:19:55.254 region:rollup2
THAT THE MAIN POINT WHICH I KNOW

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:57.389 region:rollup2
IS THE MAIN POINT IS NOT.

02:19:55.254 --> 02:19:57.923 region:rollup2
SENDING YOU THOUGHT NECESSARILY

02:19:57.389 --> 02:19:58.957 region:rollup2
TO ADULT PRISONS WHERE THE

02:19:57.923 --> 02:20:00.726 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES ARE DRAMATICALLY

02:19:58.957 --> 02:20:01.660 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE THAT REALLY.

02:20:00.726 --> 02:20:03.629 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO THE SUCCESS OF THE

02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:06.098 region:rollup2
KIDS AND AND WHERE THEY'RE

02:20:03.629 --> 02:20:07.633 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THEIR BEST

02:20:06.098 --> 02:20:11.570 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTES SO GETTING REPORTS

02:20:07.633 --> 02:20:13.805 region:rollup2
BACK. VERY OUT HOW WE CAN BETTER

02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:14.740 region:rollup2
ANALYZE THIS PROGRAM THINK SHOW

02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:16.842 region:rollup2
SOME LIGHT IN.

02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:21.513 region:rollup2
ON WHAT'S WHAT'S BEING EFFECTIVE

02:20:16.842 --> 02:20:22.814 region:rollup2
OR NOT EFFECTIVE ONE THING I

02:20:21.513 --> 02:20:23.482 region:rollup2
WOULD ASK DOES AND THIS IS.

02:20:22.814 --> 02:20:24.616 region:rollup2
IT'S HIGH REALLY SELFISH THAT WE

02:20:23.482 --> 02:20:28.587 region:rollup2
GET SOME REPORTS BACK PRIOR TO

02:20:24.616 --> 02:20:29.254 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

02:20:28.587 --> 02:20:32.090 region:rollup2
OTHER ALONG THE LINE SO THAT WE

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:33.158 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE IT LOOK

02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:35.260 region:rollup2
AT IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM BUT

02:20:33.158 --> 02:20:35.894 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE STILL HERE.

02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:37.863 region:rollup2
WHEN WE START TO GET SO REPORTS

02:20:35.894 --> 02:20:39.364 region:rollup2
BACK SO WE CAN WORK WITH DJJ ON

02:20:37.863 --> 02:20:41.967 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTIVENESS

02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:43.235 region:rollup2
OF THIS PROGRAM IS AS IT GETS

02:20:41.967 --> 02:20:44.036 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED. BUT.

02:20:43.235 --> 02:20:45.504 region:rollup2
I THINK THE STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:20:44.036 --> 02:20:47.839 region:rollup2
DIRECTION WE JUST NEED TO MAKE

02:20:45.504 --> 02:20:49.541 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THAT THERE ARE THE.

02:20:47.839 --> 02:20:51.710 region:rollup2
PROPER PROCEDURES IN PLACE

02:20:49.541 --> 02:20:53.679 region:rollup2
FOR TRULY FOR THE BENEFITS OF OF

02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:54.947 region:rollup2
THOSE KIDS PROGRAMMING

02:20:53.679 --> 02:20:55.380 region:rollup2
RECIDIVISM REDUCTION AND GETTING

02:20:54.947 --> 02:20:56.982 region:rollup2
THEM BACK INTO THEIR

02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:58.984 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:20:56.982 --> 02:20:59.851 region:rollup2
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE LIKE I KNOW

02:20:58.984 --> 02:21:01.920 region:rollup2
THAT'S PART OF YOUR GOALS AS

02:20:59.851 --> 02:21:04.056 region:rollup2
WELL. AND SO I I THINK THIS IS A

02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:04.923 region:rollup2
GOOD PROPOSAL BUT WE JUST NEED

02:21:04.056 --> 02:21:06.792 region:rollup2
TO WORK OUT A LITTLE BIT THE

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:09.127 region:rollup2
DETAILS AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE

02:21:06.792 --> 02:21:10.429 region:rollup2
GETTING REPORTS BACK. TO THE

02:21:09.127 --> 02:21:11.363 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN A TIMELY WAY.

02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:14.032 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO ANALYZE THIS AND

02:21:11.363 --> 02:21:15.267 region:rollup2
AND HELP.

02:21:14.032 --> 02:21:17.002 region:rollup2
TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM

02:21:15.267 --> 02:21:17.636 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE IN.

02:21:17.002 --> 02:21:19.771 region:rollup2
AND SO WITH THE RESULTS THAT WE

02:21:17.636 --> 02:21:21.807 region:rollup2
NEED.

02:21:19.771 --> 02:21:23.909 region:rollup2
THANK YOU BUT I I AGREE THAT.

02:21:21.807 --> 02:21:25.243 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. THAT THIS IS

02:21:23.909 --> 02:21:26.945 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY HAVING US IN THE RIGHT

02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:30.849 region:rollup2
DIRECTION OF WOULDN'T THIS IS

02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:34.019 region:rollup2
MENTIONED AS A PILOT PROGRAM. OF

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:37.155 region:rollup2
BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN IN DAY.

02:21:34.019 --> 02:21:39.458 region:rollup2
MOST PILOTS DO.

02:21:37.155 --> 02:21:41.059 region:rollup2
WE WE DID WANT TO KNOW THAT.

02:21:39.458 --> 02:21:42.627 region:rollup2
WE DO UNDERSTAND THE.

02:21:41.059 --> 02:21:44.229 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDATION BY THE ILIO

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:44.463 region:rollup2
TO HAVE LIMITED TERM FUNDING

02:21:44.229 --> 02:21:45.997 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

02:21:44.463 --> 02:21:47.466 region:rollup2
.

02:21:45.997 --> 02:21:48.533 region:rollup2
YEAH AT THAT ADDING A SUNSET

02:21:47.466 --> 02:21:50.402 region:rollup2
DATE DOES PROVIDE SOME

02:21:48.533 --> 02:21:51.937 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL ISSUES FOR THE

02:21:50.402 --> 02:21:53.405 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT SUCH AS HIRING FOR

02:21:51.937 --> 02:21:54.773 region:rollup2
THE POSITIONS AND WE DO WANT TO

02:21:53.405 --> 02:21:56.141 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT THE BUDGET IS.

02:21:54.773 --> 02:21:58.010 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AVAILABLE TO BE

02:21:56.141 --> 02:21:59.177 region:rollup2
REVISITED AND REVIEWED IN THE

02:21:58.010 --> 02:22:01.179 region:rollup2
ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS IF THE

02:21:59.177 --> 02:22:04.015 region:rollup2
CHANGES NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE.

02:22:01.179 --> 02:22:05.650 region:rollup2
WE DO MENTION PILOT IN THE.

02:22:04.015 --> 02:22:08.754 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL I'M IN THE.

02:22:05.650 --> 02:22:09.955 region:rollup2
PLAN TO REVIEW THIS POPULATION

02:22:08.754 --> 02:22:11.623 region:rollup2
WHILE GOING THROUGH THE PROGRAM

02:22:09.955 --> 02:22:14.393 region:rollup2
TO SEE HOW BENEFICIAL IT IS TO

02:22:11.623 --> 02:22:15.660 region:rollup2
SEE IF IT CAN BE APPLIED TO

02:22:14.393 --> 02:22:17.796 region:rollup2
FUTURE POPULATIONS.

02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:19.564 region:rollup2
I'M KIND OF A STICKLER ABOUT

02:22:17.796 --> 02:22:20.766 region:rollup2
PILOTS THE AND LIKE TO BELIEVE

02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:22.701 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY ARE PILOTS AT THIS

02:22:20.766 --> 02:22:23.869 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE. WE LEARN

02:22:22.701 --> 02:22:25.704 region:rollup2
FROM IT BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY

02:22:23.869 --> 02:22:27.739 region:rollup2
TO GET OUT OF IT IF IT'S NOT

02:22:25.704 --> 02:22:29.207 region:rollup2
WORKING BECAUSE OF WHERE SOME

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:30.809 region:rollup2
XIN IS THAT THESE THINGS WORK.

02:22:29.207 --> 02:22:32.577 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES THEY DO BUT.

02:22:30.809 --> 02:22:35.013 region:rollup2
HAVING BEEN AROUND.

02:22:32.577 --> 02:22:36.915 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACIES FOR A LONG ENOUGH

02:22:35.013 --> 02:22:38.950 region:rollup2
TIMETO KNOW THAT.

02:22:36.915 --> 02:22:41.620 region:rollup2
YOU COULD UNDO YOU COULDN'T

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:43.789 region:rollup2
BASICALLY UNDO THE GOOD THAT YOU

02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:44.623 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE TO DO AN AUDIT OF

02:22:43.789 --> 02:22:46.491 region:rollup2
OTHERS THAT IT THERE SO FOR

02:22:44.623 --> 02:22:47.893 region:rollup2
INSTANCE IT SUPPOSEDLY IT'S NOT

02:22:46.491 --> 02:22:49.428 region:rollup2
GOING TO. IT'S GOING TO MAKE

02:22:47.893 --> 02:22:50.929 region:rollup2
MORE KIDS MAKES IT NOT TRIED AS

02:22:49.428 --> 02:22:51.897 region:rollup2
ADULTS BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT

02:22:50.929 --> 02:22:54.366 region:rollup2
IT COULD ACTUALLY HAVE MORE

02:22:51.897 --> 02:22:55.167 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BEING TRIED AS ADULTS AND

02:22:54.366 --> 02:22:58.570 region:rollup2
WANTED TO AVOID THE JUVENILE

02:22:55.167 --> 02:22:59.938 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. BECAUSE THEY FIGURE THAT

02:22:58.570 --> 02:23:02.607 region:rollup2
MAY BE AN EASIER SYSTEM ON FOLKS

02:22:59.938 --> 02:23:04.476 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WANNA KEEP LONGER. AND

02:23:02.607 --> 02:23:06.511 region:rollup2
SO WE MAY FIND OUT IS THAT THERE

02:23:04.476 --> 02:23:07.779 region:rollup2
ARE MORE KIDS BEING TRIED IN THE

02:23:06.511 --> 02:23:09.481 region:rollup2
ADULT COURT. IN THE JUVENILE

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:12.517 region:rollup2
COURT IF THAT HAPPENS THEN HOW

02:23:09.481 --> 02:23:12.851 region:rollup2
DO WE ASSESS AT HOW DO WE GET

02:23:12.517 --> 02:23:13.518 region:rollup2
OUT OF THIS.

02:23:12.851 --> 02:23:14.119 region:rollup2
IF IT HAS THE NEGATIVE AFFECT

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:14.586 region:rollup2
IN AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US

02:23:14.119 --> 02:23:15.153 region:rollup2
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

02:23:14.586 --> 02:23:16.421 region:rollup2
BUT I KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:18.223 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH

02:23:16.421 --> 02:23:20.625 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN THE SYSTEM OFTEN

02:23:18.223 --> 02:23:21.226 region:rollup2
CALCULATE IN THEIR OWN MIND WHAT

02:23:20.625 --> 02:23:23.361 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY WANT TO SEE IN

02:23:21.226 --> 02:23:25.430 region:rollup2
RESULT. AND AS A RESULT CAN

02:23:23.361 --> 02:23:27.132 region:rollup2
BASICALLY UNDO THE PROCESS BY

02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:29.101 region:rollup2
HAVING MORE BY KIDS TRIED IN THE

02:23:27.132 --> 02:23:30.302 region:rollup2
ADULT SYSTEM VERSES IN THE

02:23:29.101 --> 02:23:30.869 region:rollup2
JUVENILE SYSTEM IF THEY FIGURE

02:23:30.302 --> 02:23:31.670 region:rollup2
THERE'S GONNA BE AN EASY WAY

02:23:30.869 --> 02:23:33.338 region:rollup2
OUT.

02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:35.907 region:rollup2
AND US I WOULD HATE THAT TO

02:23:33.338 --> 02:23:37.776 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TALL IN TERMS OF OUR

02:23:35.907 --> 02:23:39.244 region:rollup2
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND OTHERS IN

02:23:37.776 --> 02:23:41.112 region:rollup2
TERMS OF MAKING THOSE DECISIONS.

02:23:39.244 --> 02:23:43.014 region:rollup2
THAT OFTEN HAPPENS TO CERTAIN

02:23:41.112 --> 02:23:45.250 region:rollup2
KIDS AND SO WE MAY DISCOVER THAT

02:23:43.014 --> 02:23:46.218 region:rollup2
WE BASICALLY UNDONE ALL THE GOOD

02:23:45.250 --> 02:23:46.518 region:rollup2
THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO

02:23:46.218 --> 02:23:48.053 region:rollup2
DO.

02:23:46.518 --> 02:23:48.987 region:rollup2
IN THAT HAPPENED SOMEWHERE ELSE

02:23:48.053 --> 02:23:51.223 region:rollup2
IN THE SO

02:23:48.987 --> 02:23:53.124 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR

02:23:51.223 --> 02:23:55.560 region:rollup2
US TO. BUILD IN SOME OF THOSE

02:23:53.124 --> 02:23:57.662 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARDS AND SOME OF THOSE OFF

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:59.097 region:rollup2
RAMPS IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS OF SO

02:23:57.662 --> 02:24:00.866 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE NOT LOCKED IN AND

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:02.634 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S DISCOVER OURSELVES.

02:24:00.866 --> 02:24:04.402 region:rollup2
OF FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD WITH

02:24:02.634 --> 02:24:05.770 region:rollup2
MAYBE FEW PEOPLE IN IN THE JUNE

02:24:04.402 --> 02:24:08.106 region:rollup2
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MORE OF THEM

02:24:05.770 --> 02:24:08.940 region:rollup2
IN THE ADULT SYSTEM A BECAUSE OF

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:10.442 region:rollup2
WHAT FOLKS WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:12.677 region:rollup2
AND FELT WE WERE. TRYING TO BE

02:24:10.442 --> 02:24:13.411 region:rollup2
EASY ON CRIME HERE IN SACRAMENTO

02:24:12.677 --> 02:24:15.547 region:rollup2
SO.

02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:17.516 region:rollup2
I THINK A PILOT IS IS IMPORTANT

02:24:15.547 --> 02:24:19.084 region:rollup2
AND AND SOME ASSESSMENTS ALONG

02:24:17.516 --> 02:24:20.385 region:rollup2
THE WAY AS MY COLLEAGUES TALKS

02:24:19.084 --> 02:24:22.654 region:rollup2
ABOUT. A HAVING.

02:24:20.385 --> 02:24:23.155 region:rollup2
MORE ASSESSMENT MAKE SURE THAT

02:24:22.654 --> 02:24:23.622 region:rollup2
WE HEADING IN THE RIGHT

02:24:23.155 --> 02:24:25.223 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

02:24:23.622 --> 02:24:27.025 region:rollup2
I THINK IF WE PROBABLY HAD DONE

02:24:25.223 --> 02:24:28.760 region:rollup2
MORE ASSESSMENTS IN THIS LAST

02:24:27.025 --> 02:24:29.895 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS OF INCARCERATION WE

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:31.863 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE STOPPED

02:24:29.895 --> 02:24:33.832 region:rollup2
SOMEONE A MADNESS THAT WE SAW. A

02:24:31.863 --> 02:24:35.700 region:rollup2
TAKING PLACE AS WE OUT WENT FROM

02:24:33.832 --> 02:24:37.469 region:rollup2
WHAT TWENTY FIVE MONTHS DID NOT

02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:39.237 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TWENTY

02:24:37.469 --> 02:24:40.205 region:rollup2
NINE YEARS WHATEVER THE PEOPLE

02:24:39.237 --> 02:24:41.673 region:rollup2
BEING IMPRISONED WE PROBABLY

02:24:40.205 --> 02:24:42.941 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE. STOPPED SOME OF THE

02:24:41.673 --> 02:24:44.743 region:rollup2
CRAZINESS THAT WE DID END UP

02:24:42.941 --> 02:24:45.644 region:rollup2
REASSESSED THE DIRECTION WE WERE

02:24:44.743 --> 02:24:48.079 region:rollup2
GOING BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

02:24:45.644 --> 02:24:48.713 region:rollup2
ANYONE. INTENDED TO INCREASE

02:24:48.079 --> 02:24:51.049 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER VIEWS PEOPLE SPEND

02:24:48.713 --> 02:24:53.451 region:rollup2
IN PRISON APE THEY INTENDED TO

02:24:51.049 --> 02:24:55.253 region:rollup2
MAKE THE WORLD SAFER. ANDA AND

02:24:53.451 --> 02:24:58.523 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T LET ME

02:24:55.253 --> 02:25:02.060 region:rollup2
DESCRIBE THAT MUSCLE IN MAKE THE

02:24:58.523 --> 02:25:02.527 region:rollup2
WORLD SAFER BUT WE JUST MADE A

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:03.094 region:rollup2
PRISON SYSTEM LARGER.

02:25:02.527 --> 02:25:03.795 region:rollup2
YET IF I MAY REALLY QUICK

02:25:03.094 --> 02:25:04.462 region:rollup2
AMATEUR NORTH PART IN A FINANCE.

02:25:03.795 --> 02:25:05.597 region:rollup2
I DO YOU JUST WANT TO REITERATE

02:25:04.462 --> 02:25:07.065 region:rollup2
OUR POINT THAT THE INTENT OF

02:25:05.597 --> 02:25:08.934 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY JUST TO

02:25:07.065 --> 02:25:11.369 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE JUVENILE COURTS. TO.

02:25:08.934 --> 02:25:13.605 region:rollup2
TRY THESE JUVENILES AS IN THE

02:25:11.369 --> 02:25:13.972 region:rollup2
JUVENILE COURT NOT SET HIM TO

02:25:13.605 --> 02:25:15.440 region:rollup2
THE DOOR QUIRK.

02:25:13.972 --> 02:25:16.741 region:rollup2
AND ALSO I WE DO WANT TO POINT

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:18.443 region:rollup2
OUT THAT WHILE RAISING THE AGE

02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:20.478 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION TO TWENTY FIVE DOES

02:25:18.443 --> 02:25:22.080 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR LINK

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:23.548 region:rollup2
LONGER LENGTHS OF STAY.

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:25.951 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NEVER OUR INTENT.

02:25:23.548 --> 02:25:27.219 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT OVER A TWO YEAR

02:25:25.951 --> 02:25:28.753 region:rollup2
PERIOD AT DJJ.

02:25:27.219 --> 02:25:30.088 region:rollup2
.

02:25:28.753 --> 02:25:31.890 region:rollup2
ONLY ABOUT ONE POINT NINE

02:25:30.088 --> 02:25:33.792 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF RELEASES ACTUALLY

02:25:31.890 --> 02:25:34.726 region:rollup2
STAYED UNTIL THEIR MAXIMUM YOU

02:25:33.792 --> 02:25:36.027 region:rollup2
KNOW CONFINEMENT TIME OF TWENTY

02:25:34.726 --> 02:25:37.562 region:rollup2
THREE SOARED TALKING EIGHT

02:25:36.027 --> 02:25:39.064 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OUT OF. FOUR HUNDRED AND

02:25:37.562 --> 02:25:40.231 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR I THINK THAT WERE

02:25:39.064 --> 02:25:42.100 region:rollup2
RELEASED OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:43.068 region:rollup2
SO I JUST WANNA POINT OUT THEIR

02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:44.703 region:rollup2
X. AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:25:43.068 --> 02:25:46.738 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASINGLY SO

02:25:44.703 --> 02:25:47.505 region:rollup2
STAY. AGAIN NEVER OUR INTENT AND

02:25:46.738 --> 02:25:48.707 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THE WORK THAT THE

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:50.408 region:rollup2
BOARD A JUVENILE HEARINGS HAS

02:25:48.707 --> 02:25:51.743 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING AND FOCUSING ON

02:25:50.408 --> 02:25:52.711 region:rollup2
RELEASING JUVENILES WHEN THEY'RE

02:25:51.743 --> 02:25:54.379 region:rollup2
READY NOT WHEN THEY'RE MAKSIM

02:25:52.711 --> 02:25:55.547 region:rollup2
CONTENT CONFINEMENT TIME IS

02:25:54.379 --> 02:25:57.983 region:rollup2
THERE. YOU'LL THINK THIS

02:25:55.547 --> 02:25:58.316 region:rollup2
PRACTICE WILL BE CHANGING

02:25:57.983 --> 02:25:58.483 region:rollup2
ANYTIME SOON.

02:25:58.316 --> 02:25:59.884 region:rollup2
SO.

02:25:58.483 --> 02:26:01.219 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO SEE

02:25:59.884 --> 02:26:02.887 region:rollup2
SAM OUR PROPOSAL OF RAISING IT

02:26:01.219 --> 02:26:04.322 region:rollup2
NOT THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH THE

02:26:02.887 --> 02:26:05.857 region:rollup2
INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL I THINK

02:26:04.322 --> 02:26:07.692 region:rollup2
ALL OF US AGREE THAT THAT IT'S A

02:26:05.857 --> 02:26:08.793 region:rollup2
IT'S A GOOD INTENT. AND WE KNOW

02:26:07.692 --> 02:26:10.328 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYBODY SITTING AT THESE

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:11.429 region:rollup2
TABLES HAVE AS THEIR THEIR

02:26:10.328 --> 02:26:13.732 region:rollup2
INTENT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:15.233 region:rollup2
THAT WERE COSTLY MONITORING IT

02:26:13.732 --> 02:26:17.068 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE WHEN IT

02:26:15.233 --> 02:26:19.304 region:rollup2
WHEN IT WHEN IT GOES LIVE AND

02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:19.871 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE INTENT AND

02:26:19.304 --> 02:26:21.706 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WILL ACCOMPLISHING

02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:24.643 region:rollup2
THAT AND. AND AS A SAID MAKING

02:26:21.706 --> 02:26:25.210 region:rollup2
SOME ASSESSMENTS ALONG THE WAY

02:26:24.643 --> 02:26:25.577 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS STILL

02:26:25.210 --> 02:26:26.111 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHING.

02:26:25.577 --> 02:26:27.846 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:26:26.111 --> 02:26:29.314 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE THE

02:26:27.846 --> 02:26:31.416 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF TO

02:26:29.314 --> 02:26:33.084 region:rollup2
OCCUR AS A RESULT OF SOME GOOD

02:26:31.416 --> 02:26:33.585 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE

02:26:33.084 --> 02:26:34.653 region:rollup2
DOING THAT'S THAT'S ONLY

02:26:33.585 --> 02:26:36.254 region:rollup2
POSITION.
