SUGGESTION THAT IF A TENANT HAS

01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:53.249
SERIOUS HABITABILITY ISSUES

FACING ISSUES THAT ARE SO

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.687
SEVERE THAT THEY LITERALLY

01:00:57.754 --> 01:01:00.023
COULD LEAD TO A FIRE COULD LEAD

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.391
TO A HEALTH IMPACT OR IF THEY

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:02.592

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:03.926
HAVE HOT WATER BUT THEY SHOULD

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.661
GO TO THE COURTS AND NOT GO TO

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:06.496
CODE ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR OWN

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:08.364

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.108
BILL DOES NOT CHANGE WHO PAYS

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:19.976
FOR THAT A CODE ENFORCEMENT

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:21.310
THAT'S DIRECTED BY EVERY CITY

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:23.146
WITHIN THEIR OWN ORDINANCES IN

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:25.048
MANY CITIES THE CITY ACTUALLY

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:26.516
DOES NOT BILL THE LANDLORD IN

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:27.683

MUNICIPALITIES THE DIFFERENCE

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.528
IS THAT WHILE MANY CITIES

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:39.595
PROBABLY MOST OF THE CITIES

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:41.631
THAT YOU ALL REPRESENT A TENANT

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:43.566

ENFORCEMENT THEY HAVE A SERIOUS

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.669
PROBLEM THERE ARE A FEW CITIES

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.304

CONDITIONS. THAT IS THE

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:14.764
POPULATION THAT THIS BILL

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:17.266
ADDRESSES THIS DOES NOT AFFECT

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:18.668
VERY MANY CITIES BECAUSE NOT

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:20.536
MANY CITIES PUT THAT BURDEN ON

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:23.439
TENANTS MOST CITIES DO THAT

CODE ENFORCEMENT WHEN THERE ARE

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:27.176
SERIOUS COMPLAINTS. THIS IDEA

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.511
THAT TENANTS ARE GOING TO BE

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:29.545

JUST NOT GROUNDED IN ANY OF

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:36.686

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:38.454
THAT TENANTS WHO ARE POOR.

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:39.188
TENANTS YOU MIGHT BE

TURN TO IN THAT CASE. THIS BILL

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:49.098
WAS SPONSORED BY THE WESTERN

FOR BILLS THAT DOES NOT CHANGE.

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.577
PROBABLY MOST OF WHAT HAPPENS

THE CITY OF BURBANK A FEW YEARS

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:12.387
AGO AND THERE RANCHO AREA WHICH

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.489
IS A HORSE OWNED AREA- THEY

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:15.390
HAPPEN TO BE NEAR A COUPLE OF

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:17.959
HIGHWAYS. AND WHEN THE ADVENT

POPPED UP MORE MORE PEOPLE WERE

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:24.800
GETTING OFF OF THE HIGHWAY TO

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:25.267
MOVE FOR THIS LITTLE

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:28.270
NEIGHBORHOOD. ARE TO BE TRAFFIC

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:28.937
AND A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:30.539
WEREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:31.173
WE'RE IN A HURRY TO GET TO WORK

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:32.741
AND THEY WERE SPEEDING. SO THE

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.509
NEIGHBORS IN THE AREA WENT TO

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:35.510
THEIR CITY COUNCIL AND SAID

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:37.112
PLEASE WE NEED SOME TRAFFIC

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:38.180
ENFORCEMENT HERE PEOPLE ARE

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:39.748
SPEEDING IS A ONE LANE ROADS WE

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.616
HAVE HORSES WE HAVE KIDS. CAN

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:42.317
YOU PLEASE COME OUT AND GIVE

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.553
SOME TICKETS. WELL THE CITY

01:18:44.619 --> 01:18:45.720
CAME OUT AND REALIZED I HADN'T

01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:47.255
DONE A SPEED SURVEY IN TEN

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:48.657
YEARS AND THEREFORE WERE NOT

01:18:48.723 --> 01:18:49.257
ALLOWED TO ENFORCE THE TRAFFIC

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:51.126
RULES. THEY DID THEIR SPEED

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:53.128
SURVEY AND WONDER OF WONDERS

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:54.696
FOUND OUT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:56.498
WERE SPEEDING. BUT BECAUSE OF

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:57.999
THE ARCANE WAYS THAT WE ARE

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.367
FORCED TO SAID TRAFFIC LAWS IN

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:00.969
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.437
ORDER TO ENFORCE THE CITY

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:04.506
BURBANK WAS HAD TO RAISE THE

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:08.376
SPEED LIMITS. TO ACCOMMODATE

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:08.977
THE SPEEDING TRAFFIC. THAT IS

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.145
ACTUALLY HAPPENS ACROSS OUR

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:12.647
STATE. RECENTLY THE CITY OF LOS

01:19:12.714 --> 01:19:14.082
ANGELES HAD TO RAISE THE SPEED

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:16.585
LIMITS. ON LITERALLY OVER A

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.453
HUNDRED MILES OF ROADS. JUST TO

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.722
ENFORCE SPEEDING IN TO TRY TO

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:21.256
STOP SPEEDING AND RECKLESS

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:24.025
DRIVING. SO A FEW YEARS AGO I

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:25.360
WAS ONE OF THE MANY NOT

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.129
LEGISLATORS IN THE PAST TO TRY

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:30.899
TO CHANGE THIS LAW. BECAUSE

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:32.734
EVERY YEAR OVER FORTY TWO

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.136
THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE KILLED

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:37.038
IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS. AND SPEED

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:40.142
IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN 31%

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:42.911
OF ALL FATAL ACCIDENTS AND ALL

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.846
TRAFFIC FATALITIES. WE KNOW

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:46.181
THAT SPEED KILLS AND WE ALSO

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:48.483
KNOW THAT IT WAS EVEN A 5% FOR

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.885
A FIVE MILE AN HOUR REDUCTION

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:53.155
IN SPEEDS. LEADS TO ACCIDENTS

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.423
THAT ARE MUCH MORE SURVIVABLE.

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:57.526
FOR PEOPLE IN CARS AND PEOPLE

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:58.126
ON THE OUTSIDE OF CARS WHO ARE

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:01.196
HIT. SO A FEW YEARS AGO WE PUT

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:03.398
TOGETHER A VISION OF WHAT WAS

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:06.368
CALLED THE VISION. ZERO TRAFFIC

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:08.236
FATALITY TASK FORCE MADE UP OF

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:09.504
STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.973

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:15.911
WALK BIKE GROUPS AND TRAFFIC

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:17.779
SAFETY GROUPS AND THEY CAME UP

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:20.048
AFTER A YEAR OF RIGOROUS WORK

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:21.683
WITH A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:22.918

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:37.465
TARGETED APPROACH LOOKING AT

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:38.533
THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.269
