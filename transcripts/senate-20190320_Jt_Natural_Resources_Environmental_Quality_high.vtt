HERE AT THE FRONT --

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.450
ITSELF.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.218
OKAY WE'RE SURROUNDED BY PLASTIC

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.821
IT'S AN ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT --

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.724
WHICH WE INTERACT.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.093
OFFERS BACK RIGHT HERE.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.227
FIRST INTRODUCED IN THE

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:02.796
NINETEENTH CENTURY PLASTIC

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.764
QUICKLY GAINED POPULARITY

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.166
BECAUSE OF IT'S DURABILITY ITS

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.867
IT'S IT'S THE FACT IS LIGHT

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.202
WEIGHT.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:09.869
THE FACT THAT CAN BE EASILY

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.438
MOLDED INTO DIFFERENT SHAPES AND

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.840
AND SIZES AND AND AND FIT ALL

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.142
SORTS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.843
AND SO --

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.311
BUT IT IS EVEN IN THE GRAND

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:19.679
SCHEME OF HUMAN HISTORY OF

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:23.082
RELATIVELY RECENT PHENOMENON.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.151
AND BY THE MID NINETEEN SIXTIES

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.619
FIFTEEN MILLION TONS.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.254
OF PLASTIC WASTE WERE PRODUCED

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.089
EVERY YEAR SO THE MID SIXTIES

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.558
FIFTEEN MILLION TONS.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:34.661
NOW THE ANNUAL TOTAL IS NEARLY

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:35.829
THIRTY TIMES GREATER WE'RE

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.263
ALMOST AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.332
MILLION TIMES.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.367
AND THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT OUT OF

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.969
ALL THE PLASTIC EVER CREATED ON

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.638
PLANET EARTH ONLY 9%.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.941
I HAS BEEN RECYCLED 12% IS BEEN

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.375
BURNED INCINERATED WHICH OF

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.078
COURSE IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.013
I GIVEN THE PRODUCTS IN PLASTIC.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.781
AND THEN THE REMAINING SEVENTY

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.884
NINE PER IN OUR LANDFILLS IT'S

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.651
IN OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:01.020
AS LITTER --

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.989
AND FORCING MUCH MORE OF IT IS

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.124
ACTUALLY IN LITTER GLOBALLY AND

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.926
THAN IN LANDFILLS --

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.294
IS ESTIMATED AT EIGHT MILLION

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.396
METRIC TONS OF PLASTICS AND UP

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.798
IN THE OCEANS EVERY YEAR.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.399
AND THE CONCERN IS THAT IF THE

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.969
PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE BY

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:16.636
TWENTY FIFTY IT'S ESTIMATED THAT

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.004
THERE WILL BE TWELVE BILLION

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.106
METRIC TONS OF PLASTIC IN OUR

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:22.575
LANDFILLS. ONE OF BIG CHALLENGES

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.343
WHAT YOU KNOW WHY IS THIS A

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.377
PROBLEM ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.512
IS OF COURSE THAT THAT

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:26.946
DURABILITY THAT MAKES IT SO

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:28.214
USEFUL.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.884
FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE --

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.218
A ALSO MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT FOR

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.853
CLASSIC ABOUT A GREAT RIGHT IT

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.622
IS VERY SLOWLY BREAKS DOWN INTO

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:36.823
MICRO PLASTICS.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.025
WHICH ARE THEN INGESTED BY FISH

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.426
AND OTHER MARINE ANIMALS.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.961
MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE FOUND ALL

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.596
THROUGHOUT OUR OCEANS ARE FRESH

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.465
WATER ECOSYSTEMS ARE SOIL OUR

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.066
AIR.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:47.600
RECENT STUDIES OF ACTUALLY

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:48.434
FOUNDED IN.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.936
BOTTLED WATER --

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.137
AND WE KNOW NOW THAT WE'RE ON

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:54.040
TRACK TO HAVING MORE PLASTIC IN

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.341
OUR OCEAN THAN FISH --

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.544
WITHIN WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE OR

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.344
TWO NO WERE ALSO FAMILIAR WITH

00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.712
SOME OF THE MOST DRAMATIC IMAGES

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:00.880
THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO US BY

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.115
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AND OTHERS

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:03.116
THERE IS THE FAMOUS.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.184
VIDEO OF THAT SEA TURTLE WITH A

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.653
PLASTIC STRAW STUCK INTO ITS

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.221
NOSE WE'VE SEEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:10.857
MARINE ANIMALS MISTAKING PLASTIC

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.825
BAGS FOR JELLY FISH --

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:14.260
THERE WAS OF JUST A BEAUTIFUL

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:16.229
BUT SERENE STRANGE.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.864
IMAGES THAT THEY CAME OUT FOR

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:18.965
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC IN THEIR

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.900
SPECIAL ADDITION A CUP OF LAST

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:21.834
YEAR.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:22.669
AND THE SLIDE THAT WE SEE HERE

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:23.937
IS JUST THE LATEST THIS

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.538
LITERALLY IS FROM YESTERDAY.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.106
OUR TWO DAYS AGO JUST THIS LAST

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:28.274
FRIDAY THE PHILIPPINES BUREAU OF

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:29.475
FISHERIES AND AQUATIC RESOURCES

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.944
FOUND A YOUNG WELL THAT WAS WEAK

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.445
AND VOMITING BLOOD.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:33.880
THE ANIMAL PASSED WITHIN A FEW

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:35.448
HOURS IN A THEY SAID WELL WHAT'S

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:36.282
WHAT'S THE DEAL HERE WHAT'S

GOING ON WITH THIS WELL THEY

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:38.952
OPEN UP THE WHALE.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:42.422
AND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.289
ONE TO HAVE ALL THAT WAS

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.724
SWIMMING OFF THE COAST THEY

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.125
FOUND EIGHTY EIGHT POUNDS OF

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:48.328
PLASTIC --

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.330
INCLUDING SIXTEEN RICE SACKS IN

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.665
PLASTIC BAGS.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.567
SO YEAH THIS IS JUST A ONE

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.502
LITTLE EXAMPLE THIS IS ONE

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.204
LITTLE EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM

00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.839
THAT WE HAVE OUT IN OUR OCEANS

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.341
RIGHT NOW.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.775

BE LEARNING ABOUT THE PLASTIC

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:06.879
POLLUTION IN GENERAL WE'RE GONNA

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.214

HEADS AROUND THIS IS VERY VERY

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.668
SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE FACE AS

WHAT'S THE THE FAMOUS LINE IN

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:19.819
THE GRADUATE BUT THE FUTURE.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.387

OUR FUTURE I THINK IS GOING TO

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:32.699
HAVE TO LOOK A LOT DIFFERET IF

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.867
WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:36.369
PUT OUR ECOSYSTEMS IN A PLACE TO

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:39.405
SURVIVE -- I

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:41.207
DON'T WANT TO BE THE LAST

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:42.008

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:42.809
THAT.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.178
CAN SURF IN AN OCEAN THAT.

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.747
AS LIFE IN IT --

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.282

OCEAN WITH PLASTIC [inaudible]

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:36.015
AND YOUR OTHERS SPEAKERS THEY'RE

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:36.916
GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:38.651
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS OF PLASTIC

00:13:38.717 --> 00:13:41.854
ON MARINE TO MARINE ECOSYSTEM ON

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.189
HUMAN HEALTH.

00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:45.491
AND MARINE ANIMALS AND IT'S ALSO

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:46.992
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PLASTIC

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:49.962
POLLUTION IS VERY EXPENSIVE A

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.363
CALIFORNIA LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.300
SPEND OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.702
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:57.236
CLEANING UP IN CONTROLLING

00:13:57.303 --> 00:13:58.237
LITTER.

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:00.072
MICHAEL THIS MORNING IS TO

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:01.173
PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT AND SOME

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.608
FRAMING.

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:03.976
AND MAYBE A LITTLE HOPE I'M

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.844
AROUND WHAT THE STATE IS DOING

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:06.378
TO PROTECT TO ADDRESS THE

00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:11.850
PROBLEM.

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:12.451
I HAVE MISSED THAT PICTURE BUT

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.752
HERE WE GOT.

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:15.588
THEY AND LAST YEAR IN TWENTY

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:16.188
EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA OCEAN

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.123
PROTECTION COUNCIL ADOPTED A NEW

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.259
CALIFORNIA OCEAN LITTER STRATEGY

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:21.994
PREVENTION STRATEGY AND THIS WAS

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:23.796
A STRATEGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED

00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:25.331
THROUGH A VERY EXTENSIVE --

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:26.832
STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN PROCESS

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.267
COLLABORATIVE --

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:30.369
THROUGH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:31.937
THE IDEA OF IT IS TO PROVIDE A

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:34.173
ROADMAP FOR ACTIONS THE STATE

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.641
AND OUR PARTNERS CAN TAKE TO

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.876
ADDRESS PLASTIC POLLUTION IN THE

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:38.444
OCEAN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.178
YEARS.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:40.713
ON THE STRATEGY CONTAINS THREE

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:43.482
PRIMARY PRIORITIES --

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.951
FOR PC THE FIRST IS TO DEAL

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:47.786
REFER TO A SOURCE REDUCTION THE

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:49.221
SECOND IS TO ADDRESS MICRO

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:50.723
PLASTICS A MICROFIBER.

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.491
AND THE THIRD IS TO ADDRESS

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.693
DERELICT FISHING YEAR

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:54.994
[inaudible]

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.597
AND THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS

00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:00.199
TO PREVENT LITTER FROM REACHING

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.900
THE OCEAN AND THE STATE HAS

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.936
REALLY SHOWN LEADERSHIP ON THIS

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:06.605
TOPIC IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SKI

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:07.940
SEASON.

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:09.341
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE VOTERS

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:10.943
PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY SEVEN

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.911
WHICH BANNED SINGLE USE PLASTIC

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:15.681
BAGS IN CALIFORNIA AND LAST YEAR

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.149
MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON

BEACHES AND OTHER STATE

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:38.270
FACILITIES TO BE REUSABLE

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:42.508
COMPOSTABLE OR RECYCLABLE.

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:44.209
AT NEW PC WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.578
A VARIETY OF AND PROJECTS

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:48.714
INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE FINDING

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.383
THE NEWPORT BAY TRASH WE'LL AND

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.918
WHICH IS GOING TO BE TAKING.

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.787
FLOATING TRASH AND DEBRIS IN SAN

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:56.455
DIEGO CREEK BEFORE IT ENTERS THE

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:58.390
UPPER NEWPORT BAY MARINE

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.793
PROTECTED AREA AND GETTING THAT

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.261
ALL THAT TRASH OUT OF THE WAY.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:04.596
AND THE PROJECT WAS BASED ON THE

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:05.964
VERY SUCCESSFUL.

00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:11.303
BALTIMORE MR TRASH WE'LL AND WHO

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.471
ACTUALLY REMOVES FIFTY THOUSAND

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:13.405
POUNDS OF TRASH A DAY.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:15.274
AND I'M HAS THOUSANDS AND

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.975
THOUSANDS OF SOCIAL MEDIA

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:17.910
FOLLOWERS I MEAN IT'S BEEN

00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:20.079
HUGELY SUCCESSFUL IN EDUCATING

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.880
THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:22.581
TRASH AND WILD.

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:26.285
WILDLIFE WATER QUALITY AND HELP

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:28.287
REPLICATE THAT WITH OUR NEWPORT

00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:30.622
BAY TRASH WILL WE ALSO FUNDED A

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.424
PROGRAM IN ALAMEDA --

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:33.492
TO HELP.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:34.793
RESTAURANTS REDUCE THEIR

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.796
RELIANCE ON SINGLE USE PACKAGING

00:16:37.863 --> 00:16:39.932
SO WE WE AND CURRENTLY THE

00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:42.468
PROJECT HAS CERTIFIED FORTY SIX

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.503
RESTAURANTS TO BE RE THINK

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.504
DISPOSABLE.

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.373
AND CUMULATIVELY JUST THE

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:48.841
CHANGES MADE BY JUST TEN OF

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:50.576
THOSE RESTAURANTS ATTACK ONLY

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:52.811
TEN RESTAURANTS IN THE FORTY SIX

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:53.545
PILOT RESTAURANTS.

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:55.414
WE HAVE A LIMITED ONE POINT FOUR

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.116
MILLION PIECES OF SINGLE USE

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.751
DISPOSABLE FOOD WHERE PACKAGING

00:16:58.817 --> 00:16:59.985
EVERY YEAR.

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:02.221
AND THEY'VE SAVED FORTY FIVE

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:04.223
THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY YEAR SO

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:05.557
THERE'S SOME REAL.

00:17:05.624 --> 00:17:07.192
AND PROJECTS YOU CAN DO ON THE

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:10.362
GROUND TO GET TO THIS ISSUE --

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:11.897
LOCALLY BUT ALL OF OUR PROJECTS

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:13.332
NEED TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.433
SCALABLE HOW ARE WE GOING.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.101
TO BRING THIS UP TO THE STATE

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:20.272
LEVEL AND AND HAVE AS

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.507
SIGNIFICANT AN IMPACT AS WE CAN.

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:22.741
IN TERMS OF MICRO PLASTICS AND

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:24.243
THIS IS THE SECOND PRONG OF OUR

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:27.012
PLASTIC STRATEGY AND SENATOR

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.248
PORTANTINO LAST YEAR INTRODUCED

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:31.417
REQUIRES --

00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:34.286
PC TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:37.055
MICRO PLASTIC STRATEGY SO WE ARE.

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.023
WORKING WITH SCIENTISTS FROM

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.859
AROUND THE WORLD SCALE AND THE

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:42.594
IMPACT OF MICRO PLASTICS ON

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:44.329
CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT AND OUR

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:46.665
MARINE ECOSYSTEM AND THEN TO

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:48.734
DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS A

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.969
MICRO POSIT POLLUTION.

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.638
AND FINALLY WE'RE WORKING VERY

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:54.273
CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA

AQUACULTURE HERE.

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:10.556
WE DO NOT WORK ALONE OF COURSE

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:11.657
THAT -- PC

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.025
PART OF OUR MISSION ACTUALLY IS

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:14.960
TO COORDINATE WITH OUR PARTNER

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.462
WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES --

AFFECT AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE

00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:20.365
AND THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.633
COMPLIMENTING AND NOT

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.202
DUPLICATING ONE ANOTHER.

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:25.103
AND SO CALIFORNIA COASTAL

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:25.838
CLEANUP DAY AS I MENTIONED

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:37.943
THIS CONCERN.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:38.911
THAT CHEMICAL ADDITIVES IN

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:42.314
SINGLE USER LAKE FLORENTINO

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:45.050
COMPOUNDS AND PHTHALATES ARE NOW

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:46.552
ESCAPING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.220
THROUGH THE PLASTIC WASTE.

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:49.988
I'M SO IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.456
FROM THE PUBLIC THE SAFER

00:19:51.523 --> 00:19:52.724
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM HAS

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:54.960
INCLUDED FAST FOOD PACKAGING.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:59.364
IN THEIR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY

00:19:59.431 --> 00:19:59.932
TWENTY PRIORITY PRODUCT WORK

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:00.532
PLAN.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.134
I'M AND FINALLY OPC HAS BEEN

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.869
COORDINATING EXTENSIVELY WITH

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:06.538
POWER CYCLE AND SINCE TWENTY

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:08.106
TWELVE ON ITS PACKAGING POLICIES

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:09.174
AND MOST RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:12.344
COORDINATING BOTH ON AND SB

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:12.844
THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE AND

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:13.345
THINKING THROUGH HOW TO

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:14.379
IMPLEMENT --

00:20:14.446 --> 00:20:16.582
THAT VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:17.916
PROHIBITING FOODS.

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:19.084
A FOOD SERVICE FACILITIES IN

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.886
STATE BUILDINGS FROM USING AND

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:22.220
PACKAGING THAT'S NOT REUSABLE

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:24.423
RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE AND

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.291
WE'RE ALSO COORDINATING WITH

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:27.859
CHARISMATIC ON THEIR PILOT.

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:29.962
RE USE PROGRAM WHICH WOULD

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:31.663
PROVIDE GRANTS AND FOR PROJECTS

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.098
TO PROMOTE THE RE USE OF

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:36.401
PRODUCTS THAT WE AVOID THE

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:38.103
SINGLE USE AN AB CYCLE THAT

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.738
WE'VE GOTTEN OURSELVES INTO YOU.

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:41.740
SO IN CONCLUSION I AM I WOULD

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:43.642
JUST REMIND EVERYONE MARINE TO

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:44.943
READ TO LOSE OUR BEACHES THAT

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.912
CREATES A HAZARD FOR HUMANS IT

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:48.213
IN TANGLES AND IT POISONS

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.214
WILDLIFE.

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:51.116
IT EMPLOYS IS HUGE COSTS ON

00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:52.417
LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES THROUGH

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:53.986
COLLECTION EFFORTS AND LOST

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:55.520
TOURISM REVENUE.

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:56.788
AND AND WE HAD A PC ARE

SENATE IS FOR YOUR INTEREST SO I

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:42.194
ALONG WITH.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.562
OTHERS IN THIS AT CALIFORNIA

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:45.163
STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM ALONG AS

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.098
WITH RESEARCHERS AROUND THE

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:47.365
WORLD CITY --

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:48.834
THE IMPACT OF MICRO PLASTICS IN

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.035
THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT.

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:52.037
AND THIS IS AN AREA OF GROWING

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:53.371
AN INCREASE IN THE ACTIVE AREA

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:55.073
OF RESEARCH --

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:55.941
OVER ABOUT THE LAST FIFTEEN

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:57.943
YEARS SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.612
ABOUT AND READ ANTI WHAT

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:01.213
MICROPLATE SIX IT'S GENERALLY

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:01.847
CONSIDERED. TO BE PLASTIC

00:23:01.913 --> 00:23:03.081
PARTICLES AND FIBERS THAT ARE

00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:05.650
LESS THAN FIVE MILLIMETERS DOWN

00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:07.519
TO ABOUT ONE MICRON --

00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:08.987
AND SO FOR REFERENCE --

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.322
ABOUT SEVENTY MY FRIENDS IS THE

00:23:10.388 --> 00:23:11.923
WITH HUMAN HAIR SO THESE ARE

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.525
SMALL PARTICLES THAT MAY BE

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:15.026
MANUFACTURED TO BE SMALL AS IN

00:23:15.093 --> 00:23:16.495
PRIMARY MARK PLASTICS LIKE

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:18.163
MICROBEADS --

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.265
OR THE THE RAW --

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:22.167
PALLETS OF PLASTIC LIKE MINERALS --

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:23.468
THERE'S ALSO SECONDARY MICHAEL

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:24.836
PLASTIC TO TO FORM FROM THE

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:27.506
FRAGMENTATION OF LARGER ITEMS --

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:30.008
THIS SEEMS TO HAPPEN PARTICULAR

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.143
ON BEACHES WHERE THERE'S HIGH UV

00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:33.011
IRRADIATION A LOT OF ABRASION

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.013
THAT CAUSES LARGER ITEMS TO

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.451
BREAK DOWN --

00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:42.387
IT ALSO OCCURS IS THAT ARE

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:47.692
DURING OF CLOTHING AND ALSO HAVE

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:48.593
IS FROM AERIAL THE POSITION OF

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.061
THINGS LIKE TIRE DUST.

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:52.164
AND YOU KNOW FLOATING FIBERS

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.298
FROM INDUSTRIAL CARPETING AND

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:55.133
SUCH DO YOU CAME UP WITH THE

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.736
TERM NURGLE --

00:23:57.803 --> 00:23:59.971
AT THIS IN A LETTER AND THE THE

00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:01.072
INTERNAL IS THE ROB.

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:03.708
THE MUPPET PALETTE YEAH.

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:04.776
OKAY.

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:05.544
SO --

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.946
THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY OF OF

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:09.314
MATERIALS THAT ARE MANUFACTURE

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:10.749
EVERY YEAR A HUGE RANGE OF

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:12.417
PLASTICS WITH DIFFERENT

00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:12.884
COMPOSITIONS THAT ARE

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:13.985
MANUFACTURED.

00:24:14.052 --> 00:24:15.987
AND ALONG WITH THE PLASTICS

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:17.956
THEMSELVES THERE ARE A VARIETY

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:19.658
OF CHEMICALS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:20.859
THEM INCLUDING ADDITIVES THAT

00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:22.561
ARE USED --

00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:23.829
TO PRODUCE PARTICULAR

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:25.397
CHARACTERISTICS IN PLASTIC LIKE

00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:26.998
PLASTICIZERS PHTHALATES ANTI

00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:29.167
STATIC AGENTS I'M SO THERE'S A

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:29.968
ARE.

00:24:30.035 --> 00:24:31.503
CHEMICALS THAT ARE MANUFACTURED --

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.806
INTO THE PLASTIC BUT THEN IN THE

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:35.607
ENVIRONMENT.

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:37.542
CERTAIN CHEMICALS THINGS LIKE PC

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:39.411
BEES DDT'S CLUB BROMINATED FLAME

00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:40.879
RETARDANTS TEND HAVE THIS

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:42.314
AFFINITY WHERE THEY WANNA STICK

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.716
ON TO THE SURFACE OF PLASTICS --

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.518
AND SO IT'S NOT ONLY THE

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.353
CONCERNED ABOUT PLASTICS IN A

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.921
MARMON IT'S ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.489
CHEMICALS THAT MAY BE I'M

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:52.958
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND THESE

00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:54.559
ARE CONSIDERED PRIORITY

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:55.293
CONTAMINANTS BY GAMMA

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.228
GOVERNMENTS.

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:57.495
BECAUSE THEIR PERSISTENT BY

00:24:57.562 --> 00:25:02.901
ACCUMULATIVE AND OR TOXIC.

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:04.402
MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE LIKELY THE

00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:05.637
MOST OF NUMERICALLY ABUNDANT

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:07.005
ITEMS OF PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:08.273
TODAY AND THE QUANTITIES OF

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.808
MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE INEVITABLY

00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:11.376
GOING TO INCREASE IN LARGE.

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:14.212
PART BECAUSE OF LARGER PLASTIC

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:15.914
RATING AND BREAKING UP INTO

00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:18.984
MILLIONS OF MICRO PLASTIC PIECES.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.986
AROUND THE GLOBE BUOYANT MICHAEL

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:23.255
PLASTICS ARE CONCENTRATED IN MID

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:24.756
OCEANIC GYRES SO CENTERS OF

00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:26.124
CIRCULATION LIKE THE GREAT

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.425
PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH I'M ALSO

00:25:27.492 --> 00:25:31.529
AROUND CENTERS OF CIRCULATION --

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:32.898
RECENT STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED.

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:34.199
THE NUMBER OF MY PLASTIC

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:35.400
PARTICLES FLOATING ON THE

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:38.870
SERVICE TO BE SOMETHING BETWEEN

00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:39.471
FIFTEEN TO FIFTY ONE TRILLION

00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:39.938
PARTICLES.

00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:41.606
BUT WE SHOULD BE AWARE THAT NOT

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:44.643
ALL MANUFACTURED PLASTICS FLOAT --

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:45.877
AND THAT ALSO BIOFILMS

00:25:45.944 --> 00:25:47.245
ACCUMULATE ON THE SURFACE OF

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:48.546
FLOODING PLASTICS THAT CAUSES

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:51.016
THEM TO SING DE INTO DEEP WATERS.

00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:55.086
AND TO ACCUMULATE AND SENTIMENT.

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:56.054
THE PRESENCE OF MICHAEL PLASTICS

00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:57.289
IN THE OCEAN IS NOW WELL

00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:59.257
ESTABLISHED EVEN IN VERY REMOTE

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:00.825
ENVIRONMENTS FROM THE OCEAN AT

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.260
JOHNMYERS TO THE POLLS.

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:04.095
FROM THE COAST TO DEEP OCEAN

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:05.363
TRENCHES --

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.531
MY PROPOSES A MISS AMPLE FROM

00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:09.601
BEACHES FROM SURFACE WATERS --

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:11.836
FROM DEEP WATERS INCLUDING IN

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:14.105
THE MARIANAS TRENCH THEY FOUND

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.140
SINGLE USE PLASTIC ITEMS.

00:26:15.206 --> 00:26:17.609
ADEPTS GREATER THAN TEN THOUSAND

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:18.243
METERS.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.978
AT IN THE TRENCHES MOST POLLUTED

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:22.647
REGIONS THEY FOUND A MAXIMUM OF

00:26:22.714 --> 00:26:24.849
TWO THOUSAND PIECES OF MICHAEL

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:27.052
PLASTIC FOR LEADER OF SETTLEMENT.

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:28.987
AND THIRTEEN PIECES OUR LEADER

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:33.658
IN WATER SO IT'S CERTAIN OUT THE

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:34.592
OCEAN FROM THE SURFACE TO THE

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:36.628
DEBTS.

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.196
ANSWERING CALIFORNIANS TO SOME

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:38.797
OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:40.732
DOING LOOKING AT MICHAEL PLASTIC

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.968
ON BEACHES AROUND CALIFORNIA WE

00:26:43.034 --> 00:26:44.302
FOUND MY CLASSICS THAT EVERY

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:46.237
SINGLE ONE OF FIFTY ONE BEACH IS

00:26:46.304 --> 00:26:48.707
THAT WE SAMPLED --

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:50.275
WE KNOW THAT.

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:51.676
RESIDENTS OF BEACHES LIKE TO

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:53.745
PACIFIC MALL CRABS ARE INGESTING

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:55.647
MICHAEL PLASTICS WITHIN ABOUT

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:57.015
35% MORE GRABS.

00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:58.817
AND INGESTED MARKER FIVE SIX ON

00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:00.251
THIS IS ONE MECHANISM THESE

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:01.252
FILTER FEEDING ORGANISMS THAT

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:02.520
ARE VERY COMMON ON BEACHES IN

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:04.489
CALIFORNIA. ONE MECHANISM OF

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:05.890
MICHAEL PLASTICS ENTERING INTO

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.525
COASTAL FOOD WEBS.

00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:08.760
AND EVEN IN REMOTE PLACES LIKE

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:10.228
THE BEACHES OF OF THE CHANNEL

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:11.463
ISLANDS WE FIND --

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:14.566
MARINE DEBRIS AND ALSO MICHAEL

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:17.402
PLUS SIX ON THOSE BEACHES.

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:18.970
WE FIND MICHAEL PLASTICS BEING

00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:20.171
DEPOSITED.

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:22.774
IN BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES SO WE

00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:24.242
FOUND THAT --

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.643
PLASTIC WASTE CAN INCREASE THE

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.612
DISEASE RISK OF CORALS ANNA

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:30.115
ELEVATING DISEASE RISK ABOUT

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:32.217
TWENTY TIMES FOR FOR CROSS THAT

00:27:32.283 --> 00:27:33.218
ARE ENVELOPED IN PLASTIC.

00:27:33.284 --> 00:27:35.620
ABOUT 75% OF TURTLE GRASS AND

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:37.389
BELIEVES WAS FOUND TO HAVE OF

00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:38.923
MICROPROCESSOR ON THE SURFACE

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.259
AND THE CENTER CITY THEM

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.861
MENTIONS THAT MICHAEL PLASTICS

00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:44.129
ASSOCIATE WITH --

00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:45.597
PHYTOPLANKTON AGGREGATE SO THIS

00:27:45.663 --> 00:27:46.865
IS ONE MECHANISM OF MICHAEL

00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:48.333
PLASTIC SINKING INTO SETTLEMENTS

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.734
IN DEEPER WATERS.

00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:50.168
IS THAT --

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:54.005
WHAT MIGHT BE A BUOYANT PLASTIC

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:55.707
AND BECOMES A NEGATIVE THE GOING

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:57.575
AND WITH CHEN GENERALLY SINK

00:27:57.642 --> 00:28:02.380
DOWN INTO THE SETTLEMENTS?

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:03.648
MIKE ABOUT SIX SEVEN FOUND ON

00:28:03.715 --> 00:28:05.083
THE BODIES OF A HUGE VARIETY OF

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.484
MARINE ORGANISMS INCLUDING AND

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:08.286
INVERTEBRATES AND FISH AND BIRDS

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.421
AND MAMMALS.

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:10.722
OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SPECIES

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:11.790
HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CAN SEEM LIKE

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.625
A PLASTIC AND MORE THAN HALF OF

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:15.193
THOSE ARE COMMERCIALLY TARGETED

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.162
SPECIES.

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:18.930
THE SMALL SIZE AMERICA PLASTICS

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:21.232
IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE MANY

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.767
ORGANISMS ACROSS A HUGE RANGE OF

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:25.737
SIZES CAM CONSUME THEM AND THEY

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:27.338
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:29.441
MIKE PLASTICS FROM THEIR NATURAL

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:32.143
PLAYED PREY ITEMS.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.845
SO WE SEE DIRECT CONSUMPTION OF

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:35.080
MICHAEL PLASTICS BY FILTER

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:36.481
FEEDING ORGANISMS LIKE SOME OF

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:38.049
THE ONES SEEN HERE FROM ALL THE

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:39.918
WAY FROM PLANKTON UP TO

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:42.554
MEGAFAUNA LIKE MANTA RAYS.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.888
AND WE'VE SEEN A MICRO PLASTICS

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:46.825
THAT ARE DIRECTLY CONSUMED BY TO

00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:48.626
TRY TO FORCE LIKE THE MARANISS

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.895
TRANCHE AMPHIPODS SO FOUND IN

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:53.731
THE REALLY DEEP OCEANS --

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:56.534
WITH THE SENTIMENT FINDING --

00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:57.769
THEM HAVE THEY'VE CONSUMED

00:28:57.836 --> 00:28:59.304
MICHAEL PLASTICS --

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.972
EVEN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.373
CALIFORNIA LIKE THE TIDE WATER

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:02.907
GOBIES.

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:04.576
WE RECENTLY FOUND MICHAEL

00:29:04.642 --> 00:29:07.112
PLASTICS IN THEIR GILLS.

00:29:07.178 --> 00:29:10.615
AND SPECIES OF SEA BIRD THAT IN

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:15.353
JUST OCEAN OF ALSO BEEN SHOWN.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.289
TO TO INGEST MICROPROCESSOR.

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:20.558
SO THEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT MICRO

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.827
PLASTIC ARE THAT WE KNOW THAT

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.062
ORGANISMS ARE EATING THEM ONE OF

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:26.231
THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES SO WE

00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:27.899
SEE PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES SO

00:29:27.966 --> 00:29:29.634
CLOGGING OF THE GOD OR SATIATION

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:31.336
SO THE ANIMALS ARE NOT.

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:33.037
MOTIVATED TO FEED --

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.005
THAT LEAST ALTERED FEEDING

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:36.007
BEHAVIOUR POTENTIALLY IMPACTION

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:38.009
OF GOT PERFORATION AND TISSUE

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:40.011
DAMAGE SO THESE ARE ALL PHYSICAL

00:29:40.078 --> 00:29:40.745
EFFECTS.

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:41.980
AND THEN THERE MAY BE CHEMICAL

00:29:42.046 --> 00:29:43.314
EFFECTS FROM MICHAEL PLASTICS

00:29:43.381 --> 00:29:44.883
THAT INCLUDE A TOXICITY WHICH

00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:47.452
MAY BE DUE TO THE PLASTICS OR

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:48.052
CHEMICALS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.454
WITH THEM --

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:51.322
INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES IMMUNE

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:54.626
RESPONSES AND IMPACTS TO

00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:56.227
REPRODUCTION AND GROWTH SO

00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:58.029
GENERALLY A LOT OF THE LIBERTY

00:29:58.096 --> 00:29:58.963
STUDIES --

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.565
AND FEEL CITIES THAT HAVE SHOWN

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.300
IMPACTS OF MICHAEL PLASTIC TEND

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:03.501
TO BE -- THE

00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:04.736
SUBTLE EFFECTS THAT ARE SUB

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:06.804
LETHAL SO IMPACTS ON

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.673
REPRODUCTION IMPACTS ON GROWTH --

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.941
OR IMPACTS OF INDIVIDUAL

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:11.676
MORTALITY WE'RE NOT WE HAVEN'T

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:13.745
DEMONSTRATED REALLY VERY BROAD

00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:15.580
POPULATION AND COMMUNITY LEVEL

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:16.548
EFFECTS OF MICRO PLASTIC RIGHT

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:17.215
NOW.

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:18.383
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:19.651
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.386
BECAUSE MIKE PLASTICS ARE

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:23.154
OBVIOUSLY INCREASING --

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:24.956
AND OUR ABILITY TO DETECT THEM

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:26.524
AND TO DETECT THEIR EFFECT IS

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:30.562
GOING TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN

00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:31.996
THE FUTURE.

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:32.964
SO THESE ON GROWING CONCERNS AS

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:34.032
I MENTIONED THAT MY REPLY SIX

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:35.500
ARE UBIQUITOUS IN MARINA

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:39.003
VARMINTS THEY ARE INCREASING --

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.972
OVER TIME.

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.373
AND THERE SEEMS TO BE EVIDENCE

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.608
OF A FACT --

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:44.742
VERTICALLY ON VULNERABLE LIFE

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:46.277
HISTORY STAGES REPRODUCTIVE

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:47.545
EFFECTS --

00:30:47.612 --> 00:30:49.247
THAT COULD HAVE POPULATION LEVEL

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:50.248
CONSEQUENCES.

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:51.149
THE SEAFOOD CONSUMPTION IS ONE

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:53.284
PATHWAY --

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.886
FOR PLASTICS EXPOSURE WE KNOW

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:57.422
THAT THEIR PRESENT IN OUR

00:30:57.488 --> 00:30:58.890
COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES --

00:30:58.957 --> 00:30:59.824
COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES

00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:01.159
LIKE MUSCLES AND OYSTERS AND

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:02.894
FISH IS THAT ARE SOLD FOR HUMAN

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:03.962
CONSUMPTION.

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:05.129
BUT IN MY REC REPRESENT A

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:07.265
RELATIVELY SMALL BURDEN TO THE

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.100
INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS SO

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:11.135
SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY TWO HUNDRED

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.670
PARTICLES PER MUSCLE --

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:14.672
AND IT A VERY COMMITTED SEAFOOD

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:18.977
EATER MIGHT CONSUME AS MANY AS

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:19.577
ELEVEN THOUSAND PARTICLES PER

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:20.478
YEAR.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:21.813
SO THESE BY ACCUMULATION AND

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:23.047
FOOD CHAIN AFFECTED NOT YET WELL

00:31:23.114 --> 00:31:24.782
UNDERSTOOD BUT WE SHOULD HAVE

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:26.251
CONCERN ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE

00:31:26.317 --> 00:31:27.518
MY CAPACITY CONTAMINATION OF THE

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:28.586
AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS WILL

00:31:28.653 --> 00:31:29.988
CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:31.623
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:32.490
AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.425
KNOWLEDGE GAPS CURRENTLY --

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.494
ABOUT THE THE EFFECTS OF MICRO

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:37.795
PLASTICS ON OUR MARINE

00:31:37.862 --> 00:31:39.697
ENVIRONMENT [inaudible]

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:42.734
THANK YOU.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.901
THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:31:43.968 --> 00:31:46.070
SOBERING SOBERING PRESENTATIONS

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:49.674
BOTH AND WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.242
HERE SO LET'S OPEN UP THE THE

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:52.877
FLORIDA QUESTIONS FOLKS HAVE

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:54.812
THINGS THEY WANT TO ASK ABOUT.

00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:56.247
AS THEIR MONEY.

00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:57.715
THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOU

00:31:57.782 --> 00:32:00.051
BOTH I THINK.

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:01.119
DR STEALS PRESENTATION YOU

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:01.919
ALLUDED TO IT [inaudible]

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:05.890
BUT THE FOOD CHAIN [inaudible]

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:09.193
STUDIES ON FISH PRODUCTS

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.928
CONSUMED BY HUMANS.

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:13.064
ARE WE IS THERE DATA OR EVIDENCE

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:14.632
SHOWING THE PLASTICS BEING

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:16.267
TRANSFERRED.

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:19.103
INTO HUMANS.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.338
THERE ARE STUDIES THAT HAVE

00:32:20.405 --> 00:32:22.073
SHOWN THAT HUMANS ARE CONSUMING

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.875
MICHAEL PLASTICS AND AND THERE

00:32:23.941 --> 00:32:25.243
ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.744
THE ABILITY OF MICHAEL PLASTICS

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:28.680
TO TRANSFER FROM A PRIMER

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:29.747
CONSUMING TO A SECONDARY

00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:31.249
CONSUMERS SO IT CERTAINLY DOES

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:32.717
SEEM TO BE --

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.752
A RISK ALTHOUGH THE AS A SAY THE

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:35.987
THE ACTUAL.

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:37.322
LOAD OF MICHAEL PLASTICS IS A

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:40.191
RELATIVELY SMALL CONTRIBUTION OF

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:41.993
THE DIET.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.095
AND THEN THIS PAST YEAR THE

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:45.463
OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL FUNDED

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.864
A STUDY WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:32:46.931 --> 00:32:49.500
RESULTS YET I'M TO LOOK AT

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:51.235
WHETHER MICRO PLASTICS ARE

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:53.638
SERVING AS A VECTOR FOR DISEASE --

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:55.907
SO AS WE CAN SEEM SEAFOOD --

00:32:55.973 --> 00:32:57.542
IS THERE SOME SORT OF THAT

00:32:57.608 --> 00:33:00.845
TRANSFER OF DISEASE TO HUMANS.

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:04.649
TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONSEQUENCE

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:05.583
I THINK IS THE WAY TO EXPAND.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.387
ON CULTURE STERN ALLUDED TO SOME

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:10.922
PEOPLE THINK WELL THIS IS JUST

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:12.890
TO COASTAL PROBLEM OR AN OCEAN

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:13.224
IS A PROBLEM.

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:16.961
BUT THOSE VECTORS OF HUMAN

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:19.030
HEALTH IMPACTED.

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:20.798
THAT SEEN ANYBODY LIVING

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:24.035
ANYWHERE POTENTIALLY IMPACTED IN.

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:25.970
IS ARE THERE ON IS THE OPC

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:28.272
SUPPORTING ONGOING PUBLIC HEALTH

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.575
STUDIES ON THIS ASPECT OF

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:31.843
PLASTIC POLLUTION.

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:32.777
YES [inaudible]

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:35.279
THANK YOU.

00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:37.415
CAN YOU TELL ME IF THE IF THERE

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:38.549
ANY.

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:39.951
POSITIVE STORIES FROM AROUND THE

00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:41.819
WORLD THAT YOU HAVE COME ACROSS

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:43.421
THAT GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:45.356
HOPE POLICY SOLUTIONS OR OR

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:46.624
BEHAVIORAL CHANGES THAT YOU SEEN

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:49.026
AN ANYWHERE --

00:33:49.093 --> 00:33:50.661
THAT THAT WE CAN DRAW SOME

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:52.029
LESSONS FROM.

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.298
THAT WHERE WERE BEACH IS OR OR

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:56.501
MARINE ECO SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN

00:33:56.567 --> 00:34:00.705
ABLE TO BOUNCE BACK.

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:02.106
AS SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:03.474
QUESTIONS IN THERE I THINK THERE

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:04.942
ARE SOME HOPEFUL STORIES I DON'T

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:05.977
KNOW WHERE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:06.944
HAVE FOUND BACK.

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:09.313
AND BUT I THINK IT RIGHT HERE IN

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.182
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME REALLY.

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:12.417
INSPIRATIONAL STORIES IN TERMS

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:13.985
OF THE THE PLASTIC BAG MAN IS A

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:15.620
GREAT EXAMPLE A STARTED AT THE

00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:17.054
LOCAL LEVEL YOU KNOW GOVERNMENTS

00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:18.122
HERE AND THERE.

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:19.957
AND CITIES STARTED BANNING

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:21.426
PLASTIC BAGS AND THEN IT.

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:25.863
IT BLOSSOMED INTO THIS AND OTHER

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.398
REGIONS I THINK I'M CHAIRMAN

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:29.834
STERN MENTIONED --

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:32.670
THE OR MAYBE IT WAS CHAIRMAN ON

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.539
I'M SORRY.

00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:34.872
WHAT?

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:36.374
IS HE HE MENTIONED THE WORK

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:38.342
THAT'S GOING ON INTERNATIONALLY

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.645
AND IN THE U. K. IT'S IT TO

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.079
REALLY TAKE ON THIS NOTION OF

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.448
THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY.

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:45.283
I THINK THERE'S SOME REAL --

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:47.051
STRIDES THAT ARE BEING MADE IN

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:50.288
DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE --

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:51.222
YOU KNOW.

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:53.624
MADE OUT OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:55.560
ELEMENTS THEN PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:56.727
IN THAT BREAKDOWN IN DIFFERENT

00:34:56.794 --> 00:34:57.762
WAYS AND ARE MORE

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:59.564
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.566
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:04.502
AND CONSIDERING --

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:08.072
IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEMS AS WELL.

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:09.240
I CAN I JUST MENTIONED SO

00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:10.508
THERE'S THIS OF TWO AREAS OF

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:11.976
CONCERN WITH MICHAEL PLASTICS

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:13.878
ONE AS MICROFIBER IS WHICH SEEM

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:15.012
TO BE THE THE DOMINANT.

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:16.214
ABOUT MICHAEL MICHAEL PLASTIC

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.782
PARTICLE --

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:19.417
SO AT DRESSING --

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.918
THAT FROM A WASTE WATER

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:22.954
PERSPECTIVE MIGHT BE REALLY --

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.188
ONE WAY TO MAKE GREAT STRIDES

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:25.857
WITH THAT AND THEN THE OTHER --

00:35:25.923 --> 00:35:27.258
LITTLE BIT OF HOPE THAT I WOULD

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:29.994
LIKE TO THROW OUT THERE IS --

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:32.964
THE FRAGMENT THE PREDOMINANT ON

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.166
BEACHES AND THAT IS ONE AREA

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:36.601
THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING BIG

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:37.535
DIFFERENCES IN AN ACTUAL

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:38.936
CLEANING UP AND SERVE.

00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:40.838
THAT BEING A MAJOR SOURCE OF

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:42.507
FRAGMENTS OF MY CAPACITY --

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:44.475
IS ONE WAY THAT WE CAN --

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:45.943
HOPEFULLY REDUCE THEM ENTERING

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.311
INTO THE OCEAN SO IT'S A BEACH

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.179
CLEAN UP ALTHOUGH THEY SEEM LIKE

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:50.314
ARE YOU KNOW THEY ARE IMPORTANT

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:51.148
SORT OF SOCIAL OUT REACHED

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:51.816
PEOPLE --

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:52.650
THEY CAN ACTUALLY REALLY

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:54.519
IMPACTFUL IN REDUCING THE AMOUNT

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:57.355
OF MY CLASSES THAT BEING

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:57.655
GENERATED --

00:35:57.722 --> 00:35:59.757
SURE YEAH.

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:01.025
SIR THERE VITAL YOU'RE CERTAIN.

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:02.426
WE DROVE DOWN A LITTLE MORE ON

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:04.428
JUST THE THE STATE OF RESEARCH

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:06.230
YOU TALKED ABOUT KNOWLEDGE GAPS

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:09.066
AND WHERE IS THIS SORT OF

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:10.601
SCIENCE AND RESEARCH COMMUNITY

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:11.903
HEADING WITH THIS AND WHAT DO

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:13.437
YOU GUYS SEE GOING FORWARD SAY

00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:14.872
IN THE NEXT.

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:16.774
YEAR TO THAT.

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.809
CENTER MY MISSION THE PUBLIC

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:21.646
HEALTH SIDE OF THINGS --

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:25.483
THAT'S A I THINK OF SMART --

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.952
PAST THE TO TO GO DOWN CERTAINLY

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:29.921
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT UP TAKE LOOKS

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:31.289
LIKE IF I MEAN.

00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:32.557
AM I RIGHT TO SAY THAT DOCTOR

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:34.525
STEAL IT SOME OF THE GAPS AROUND

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:36.093
THE LIKE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.863
THE INGESTED PLASTIC ITSELF AND

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.800
WHAT GOES INTO THE THE TISSUE SO

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:43.534
IN OTHER WORDS.

00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:47.104
THE QUANTIFYING ME YOU USED

00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:47.705
ELEVEN THOUSAND PARTICLES PER

00:36:47.772 --> 00:36:49.840
PERSON -- AS

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:52.643
A THAT AMOUNT IS DETECTED IN IN

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.045
SPECIFIC AND THAT'S THAT'S

00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:55.680
ESTIMATED FOR A EUROPEAN

00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:57.682
CONSIDERED LIKE A HIGH LEVEL

00:36:57.748 --> 00:36:59.884
EUROPEAN CONSUMER OF OF SEAFOOD

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.752
YEAH OKAY SO HOW HI SEAFOOD

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:04.589
CONSUMER IN EUROPE IS A IS THAT

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:05.089
ELEVEN THOUSAND WORLD.

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:07.558
AND BUT BUT THE INTERACTION

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:08.859
BETWEEN.

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.895
THE THE THE THE MARINE LIFE

00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:12.597
INGESTION AND THEN THAT PASSED

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:14.565
THROUGH THAT STILL NOT ENTIRELY

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:15.967
UNDERSTOOD LIKE WE KNOW THAT IT

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:19.704
ENDS UP IN THE PERSON WE DON'T

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.505
KNOW EXACTLY.

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:22.707
HOW IT GETS THERE AN INTERESTING

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:23.774
HUMANS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:24.041
DETECT --

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:24.642
YOU KNOW THE IMPACT FOR MY

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:26.243
PURPOSES FROM OTHER SOURCES FOR

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.578
EXAMPLE SO THE BARTER STUDIES A

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:29.347
LOOKING AT DID YOU TRANSFER OR A

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:30.915
FOUNDRY COULD YOU TRANSFER.

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.283
OF ORGANIC POLLUTANTS FROM

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.486
MICHAEL SAM'S SO WE KNOW THAT

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:37.221
THAT OCCURS --

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:40.324
BUT IT'S I DON'T KNOW OF ANY

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:41.759
HUMAN STUDIES THAT WOULD BE

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:43.461
GOING ON IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:45.363
TO SEPARATE THAT OUT FROM --

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.497
JUST SORT OF GENERAL EXPOSURE

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:47.932
BUT YOU HAVE TO SORT YOU WORK

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:50.301
BACKWARDS FROM DO YOU DO YOU EAT

00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:52.103
ANYTHING OUT OF THE OCEAN OR NOT.

00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:53.904
YET UNDERSTOOD YES SO I I'M

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:56.440
FEELING A LITTLE WORSE ABOUT --

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:57.274
SUSHI.

00:37:57.341 --> 00:37:59.010
SO SO CAN I JUST MENTION TO MAKE

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:00.544
PEOPLE FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:01.746
ABOUT THINGS SO THE THE WHOLE

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:03.447
ORGANISM CONSUMES LIKE A MUSCLE

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:04.649
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.350
THE MICROPHONE SIX TEND TO BE IN

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:08.052
THE GUT OF THE ANIMAL SO WE CAN

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:09.286
SEE A WHOLE MUSCLE READING.

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:11.355
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ANIMAL BUT

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:13.457
FOR FISHES FOR EXAMPLE --

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:14.959
THEIR FILLETED MOST MIKE

00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:16.861
PLASTICS WOULD NOT BE IN THE IN

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:18.429
THE MUSCLE TISSUE SO BUT FOR THE

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:20.231
EUROPEAN CONSUMER YOU'RE TALKING

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:21.599
ABOUT THEY CAN'T IMAGINE THEY'RE

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.234
JUST EATING FISH BELLIES THIS

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.669
THIS WOULD BE SEVENTY THOSE

00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:25.736
WOULD BE EATING A LOT OF

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.805
SHELLFISH. FOR EXAMPLE AN OFFICE

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.240
SAYS SHELLFISH IS THE PRIMARY

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:31.375
OKAY OR OR OR OTHER FISHES THAT

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:32.643
ARE CONSUMED HOLE.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:40.818
IS THE REASON IT'S NOT KOSHER

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:43.054
YES EXACTLY.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.223
AND IS IT IT'S LIKE A LITTLE

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.527
GUILT TRIP TO DO I DO HAVE --

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:50.394
CHAIR OF THE JEWISH CAUCUSES

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:51.929
WELL -- ADAM

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:53.130
POSE LITTLE BUT SO IN ADDITION

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:53.764
TO PUBLIC HEALTH THE THIS SORT

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.332
OF BROADER IMPACT ISSUE WITHIN

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:55.933
SORT OF MARINE HEALTH AS AN

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.834
ECOSYSTEM ITSELF NOT SO MUCH IN

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:57.835
THE FISH CONSUMPTION SIDE OF

00:38:57.902 --> 00:38:58.302
THINGS.

00:38:58.369 --> 00:38:59.904
CAN YOU ARTICULATE A LITTLE MORE

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:00.204
ABOUT -- THE

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:05.476
STATE OF SO I I'D LIKE TO STRESS

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.311
THAT THIS IS AN ADDITIVE PROBLEM

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:08.846
SO I ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER

00:39:08.913 --> 00:39:10.181
ISSUES IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:11.482
WITH OVER HARVESTING AND

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:12.450
POLLUTION.

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:14.218
AND CLIMATE CHANGE THAT THIS IS

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:15.853
AN ADDITIONAL STRESSOR THAT

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.055
ORGANISMS ARE UNDERGOING SO IT'S

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:19.657
LIKELY GIVEN THAT WE'VE

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:20.725
DEMONSTRATED EFFECTS ON

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:23.194
REPRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE OR AN

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.628
INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES THAT

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:25.730
THERE COULD BE --

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.398
POPULATION LEVEL AND AND

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:28.666
COMMUNITY LEVEL AFFECTS SO

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:31.335
ECOSYSTEMS BEING DAMAGED BY THIS

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:32.737
YOUR MICROCLIMATE STICKS.

00:39:32.803 --> 00:39:34.405
A CERTAINLY AS AS MICHAEL PLUS

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:36.073
THE INCREASE WE MIGHT EXPECT TO

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.909
SEE MORE PREVALENT.

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:41.412
IMPACTS TO MARINE COMMUNITIES

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:42.947
LIKE THAT.

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:43.380
THAT.

00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:44.982
COULD MEAN COULD THIS SOUP AND

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.183
UP AT OUR SHORES I GUESS LET ME

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.752
PUT IT MORE POINTEDLY THAT THAT

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:49.620
MICRO PLASTIC.

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:51.088
WHAT WOULD LIVES IN THOSE ON

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:52.456
THOSE ISLANDS YOU KNOW THAT WE

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:53.991
WE TALK WE'RE NOT JUST BIG

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:55.760
PIECES RIGHT BUT THERE?

00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:57.294
IT IT CREATES.

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.630
A SORT OF VISCOUS QUALITY IN THE

00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:00.598
WATER YES.

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:02.166
MAY I WITH A WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.901
IT AS THAT.

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:07.304
AS OUR LUCIEN CLOUD EXPANDS THAT

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.440
WE MAY ACTUALLY SEE MORE

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:11.075
INTERFACE WITH THIS IN OUR

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.376
COMMUNITIES I MEAN WE'RE SEE

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.278
MORE ON THE CALIFORNIA COAST NOT

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:16.547
LESS IN THE FUTURE.

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:19.049
WELL IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY GLOBAL

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.351
PROBLEM WE KNOW THAT FIVE SIX OR

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:21.685
SIX CIRCULATING IN THE OCEANS

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:22.620
AND SO.

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:24.188
I THINK IT WILL DEPEND A LOT ON

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:26.490
OUR ACTIONS IN REDUCING LOCAL

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.092
SOURCES OF WE WE HAVE CONTROL

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:29.426
OVER THOSE ACTIONS YOU SAW THE

00:40:29.493 --> 00:40:31.629
RED AROUND R. COSTA YOU SHOW

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:33.831
THAT GLOBAL MAP OF ALL THE HOT

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:35.533
SPOT.

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.066
I GET A BIG --

00:40:36.133 --> 00:40:37.668
A DARK RED OFF THE WEST COAST

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:38.702
THE UNITED STATES I READ THAT

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:39.870
MAP RIGHT IS THAT CORRECT YEAH

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:41.672
SO THAT'S YOU KNOW CONSEQUENCE

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:43.140
OF THERE BEING A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.441
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR THE

00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:45.342
WEST COAST.

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:46.911
AND THE MICHAEL PLASTIC THAT

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:49.480
WE'RE SEEING ARE EIGHT YOU KNOW

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:51.749
IN TERMS OF SYNTHETIC FIBERS AND

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:53.651
SUCH OFF OUR SHORES SO --

00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:55.686
IT'S A RELATIVELY LOW SLIGHTLY

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:56.821
LOWER DENSITY IN THE WATER

00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:58.022
SLIGHTLY HIGHER DENSITY IN THE

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:58.989
SENTIMENTS BUT IT CERTAINLY

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.658
PRESENT ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA'S.

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:04.461
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO BLAME CHINA.

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:06.397
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY THE

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:07.665
SOURCES OF MICRO PLASTIC

00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:08.833
POLLUTION THIS IS ONE OF THE

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:10.534
MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:11.669
BECAUSE THEY ARE.

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.838
SMALL PARTICLES THAT DON'T COME

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.406
STAMPED WITH THE MADE IN CHINA

00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:17.908
KIND OF YOU KNOW STAMP SO IT'S

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:18.976
DIFFICULT TO SAY.

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:20.911
THE SOURCES OF POLLUTION WE KNOW

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:23.080
THAT THEY CIRCULATE SO WE GO OFF

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:24.181
THE COAST TWENTY MILES TO THE

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:25.249
CHANNEL ISLANDS.

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:26.483
I'LL BE FINE MICHAEL PLASTICS

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.651
THERE SO WE KNOW THEY'RE

00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:29.019
CIRCULATING FROM THE COAST AND

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:30.087
AND OUT.

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:31.722
INTO THE OCEAN WATERS SO IT'S

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:33.924
DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN THE

00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:35.659
SOURCES OF MY PROPOSED SOLUTION --

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:36.961
A LOT OF WHAT WE CAN DO IS

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:38.095
REALLY JUST IDENTIFYING THE

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.830
TYPES OF PLASTIC IN LOOKING AT

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:41.031
THE LIKELY SOURCES SO WHEN WE

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:42.333
FIND SYNTHETIC FIBERS WE THINK

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:44.201
THEY PROBABLY COME FROM WASTE

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:45.502
WATER FROM DOMESTIC WASHING

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:47.071
MACHINES FOR EXAMPLE --

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:49.106
BUT IT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:52.076
WHERE MICHAEL PLASTICS --

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:54.778
WHERE ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL MIKE

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:55.279
BLESSING TO COME FROM?

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:56.213
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF THE

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.781
MICROPROCESSOR CHATTED G. THAT

00:41:57.848 --> 00:42:00.050
AND THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING RIGHT

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.785
NOW IS HELPING TO FIGURE OUT IS

00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:03.420
STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY FOR

00:42:03.487 --> 00:42:04.488
CHARACTERIZING.

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:05.322
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:06.891
MICROPROCESSOR THAT THEN WE CAN

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:09.927
BEGIN TO TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:13.530
AND THE SOURCES.

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:15.266
WELCOME SENATOR JACKSON.

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:17.001
YES YOU SEE I IS A BRING THEIR

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.869
EXPERTISE TO BEAR DOCTOR STEEL

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:24.074
JUST PERFECT ROUNDUP WELCOME.

00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:24.275
YEAH.

00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:26.243
THEN WE GOT.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:26.844
OUR BACKGROUNDER ON PAGE THREE

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:28.078
TALKS ABOUT GLOBAL RESPONSES CAN

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:29.480
EACH OF YOU A COMMENT ON THE

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:31.649
EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVE THAT

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.417
WAS PASSED LAST WINTER.

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:35.419
BANNING OR REACHING A FAN OF

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:37.955
MANY SINGLE USE PLASTIC ITEMS.

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:39.590
SETTING MINIMUM CONTENTS AND

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.425
FORTUNATELY THIS LEGISLATURE WAS

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:42.526
UNABLE TO GET TO A MINIMUM

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.795
CONTENT ON PLASTIC IN IN A CALL

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:45.896
FOR EXTEND PRODUCER

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:47.631
RESPONSIBILITIES --

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:49.066
WHICH THIS.

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:51.135
LEGISLATURE WAS ON THE ROAD TO

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:54.004
GET TO IT AT ON THE WHAT THE

00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:55.506
EUROPEANS JUST DID. FOUR MONTHS

00:42:55.572 --> 00:43:00.778
AGO.

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:02.646
I WELL I CAN CERTAINLY TALK TO

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:03.948
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE

00:43:04.014 --> 00:43:06.150
MARINE ENVIRONMENTS ABOUT 8290%

00:43:06.216 --> 00:43:07.551
OF THE PLASTIC THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:08.585
IN THE ENVIRONMENT COME FROM

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:10.721
SINGLE HE'S PLASTIC SO IT SEEMS

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:11.822
LIKE -- A

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:14.024
GOOD WAY OF REDUCING THE AMOUNT

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:16.327
OF OCEAN PLASTICS TO ADDRESS THE

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:17.962
ISSUE OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC.

00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:20.030
YEAH I THINK THEY THEY WHEN THEY

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:21.398
AUTHORED AT THEY TALK ABOUT THE

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:23.100
MARINE DEBRIS ISN'T AS AS THE

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:23.667
GOAL.

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:25.869
MR MISUNDERSTAND YEAH I IS SO I

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:27.204
THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:28.472
WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE THE

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:30.307
OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM OUR

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:32.376
COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD AND

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:35.012
AND TO TAKE.

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:36.613
THEM VERY LEADERSHIP.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.682
IN IN HAND SO AND THE E. U. HAS

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:41.118
BEEN QUITE AGGRESSIVE ON

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:43.020
PLASTICS AND I THINK AND YOU

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:44.088
KNOW.

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:47.491
IN AT I THINK IT WAS IN.

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:48.859
WRITTEN IN THE BRITAIN IS THE

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.160
FIRST PLACE WHERE STARBUCKS

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:51.195
ANNOUNCED IT WAS GOING TO

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:54.865
ELIMINATE STRIDES LAST YEAR AND

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:56.066
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK ON

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:58.235
EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY

00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.404
AND ON AND SOURCE REDUCTION AND

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:01.638
ON EXTENDED PRODUCER

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:02.606
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:07.478
AND AND I THINK WE NEED TO WE

00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:08.078
NEED TO BE LEARNING FROM THIS

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:08.612
COUNTRY'S.

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:10.614
CAN I FOLLOW UP YOU HAD YOUR

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:11.849
THREE PRONGED YEAH --

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:14.551
AGENCY OR YOU'RE THE COUNCIL IS

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:15.019
WORKING ON YOUR SOURCE

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:16.553
PRODUCTION.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.455
THE CITY OF ALAMEDA NICE CITY

00:44:18.522 --> 00:44:20.391
HIGHLAND FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:22.659
YOU SPEND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:25.863
DOLLARS I BELIEVE AND YOU GET.

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.598
TEN TEN RESTAURANTS A REDUCE

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:31.168
THEIR PLASTICS AND SAVE FORTY

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:32.736
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH PER

00:44:32.803 --> 00:44:33.404
YEAR IS THAT I GET THAT RIGHT ON

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.572
THE SEA WE SPENT IT WAS FOUR

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:36.173
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PILOT

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.275
PROJECT THE GOAL IS ULTIMATELY

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:39.676
TO GET HUNDRED RESTAURANTS.

00:44:39.743 --> 00:44:42.980
AND PARTICIPATING TODAY WE HAVE

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:44.581
FORTY SIX PARTICIPATING AND SO

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:46.216
WE ARE WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY AND

00:44:46.283 --> 00:44:48.552
IT THE DATA THAT I HAD WAS ONLY

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:49.987
FROM TEN OF THOSE FORTY SIX SO

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:53.657
IT'S AS A SMALL PERCENTAGE BUT I

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:53.857
GUESS.

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:56.593
THANK YOU. ONE OTHER THING YOU

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.361
KNOW WE'RE GONNA DO OUR BEST TO

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:58.829
TRY TO REDUCE --

00:44:58.896 --> 00:45:00.397
WASTIN AND AND WERE ACTUALLY

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:01.598
HEARING A BILL LATER ON TODAY

00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:03.901
YOU ABOUT THIS VERY TOPIC --

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:06.537
BUT BUT HOW HOW MUCH OF RIVER OF

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.572
NO RETURN WITH REGARDS TO THIS

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.340
IMPACT ON HOW WE GONNA CLEAN UP.

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:11.875
YOU KNOW THIS THIS POLLUTION

00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:13.310
THAT EXIST IN SO MANY PLACES IN

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.378
OUR OCEANS --

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.180
WHAT WHAT IS THE?

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:20.451
WITH THE GLOBAL PLAN ON ON ON ON

00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:22.419
DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM AS

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:23.187
ALREADY EXISTS AS OPPOSED.

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:25.222
TO TRY TO REDUCE.

00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:25.856
THE IMPACT OF THE PROBLEM IN THE

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:28.192
FUTURE.

00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:29.560
I THINK THIS IS A LOT LIKE

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:32.162
CLIMATE CHANGE AND I THOUGHT I

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:33.897
WOULD SAY THAT IT IS A GLOBAL

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:36.233
PROBLEM WE ARE CONTINUING TO

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.202
EMITS PLASTIC PARTICLES JUST AS

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:39.269
WORRIED MEETING.

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.004
AIRBORNE CARBON DIOXIDE

00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:44.541
PARTICLES AND AND IT'S GOING TO

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:46.510
REQUIRE LOCAL ACTION AND GLOBAL

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:48.612
ACTION AND AT SOME POINT WE'RE

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:50.280
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CLEAN UP

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:51.882
WHATEVER IS OUT THERE.

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:54.618
AND AND GET RID OF IT BUT WE DO

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:56.587
HAVE TO STOP OUR OUR CONTINUED

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:57.988
PRODUCTION IS THERE ANY

00:45:58.055 --> 00:45:59.923
EFFECTIVE WAY OF MITIGATING THE

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.959
THE MICRO CLASSICS PROBLEM AS IT

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:03.193
EXISTS RIGHT NOW [inaudible]

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.962
NOW.

00:46:05.028 --> 00:46:06.763
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A WAY TO

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:07.598
MITIGATE MY PROPOSES ONCE

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:08.765
THEY'RE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:09.867
THE REALLY ALL WE NEED TO YOU

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:11.068
KNOW THAT THE MAJOR THING THAT

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:12.302
WE NEED TO DO IS TO REDUCE THE

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:13.537
SOURCE OF THEM THERE'S THERE'S

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:16.240
THERE THERE'S NO EFFECTIVE WAY

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:19.409
CURRENTLY.

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:19.910
TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THE

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.812
ENVIRONMENT.

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:23.580
NEVER GONE AWAY WHAT IF I MAY

00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:25.115
THAT THE TRASH WE'LL.

00:46:25.182 --> 00:46:26.450
RIGHT I MEAN THE THE HIPPOS OUT

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:27.718
THERE THEY CANNOT GRAB THIS

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:29.419
STUFF UP RIGHT THAT'S WHY IT'S

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:31.188
AND MIKE RUNNER THE TRASH WAS

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.322
PICKED UP THE BIG STUFF RIGHT

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:32.623
RIGHT YEAH.

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:33.457
YES IN THE CHAT THE IDEA THE

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:35.159
TRASH WILL IS TO PREVENT THAT

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:37.628
TRASH FROM BECOMING MORE MICRO

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:38.896
PLAZA.

00:46:38.962 --> 00:46:40.230
SENATOR HAS AN IDEA WE CAN GET

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:41.999
HASBRO -- TO

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:44.801
TO SUBMIT TO BASICALLY SPONSOR

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:46.703
HUNGRY HIPPOS.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:48.372
GO OUT THERE AND AND HARBORS ALL

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:50.474
UP AND DOWN THE COAST YOU LAUGH

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.142
YEAH NO IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:53.143
YEAH WELL THERE ARE PROJECTS

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.211
LIKE AND YOU KNOW LEGOS IS

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:56.880
STARTING TO USE RECYCLED PLASTIC

00:46:56.947 --> 00:46:58.415
GET'S LEGACY IT IS THIS IS ONE

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:02.753
AREA WHERE.

00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:06.990
AND YEAH AT THE THERE'S NOT.

00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:08.458
THANK YOU. TO BOTH CHAIRMAN'S IN

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:09.960
THAT THANK YOU FOR THE VERY --

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:10.527
EDUCATIONAL --

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:15.666
SO GUY IN AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT --

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:16.967
MICHAEL PLASTICS AND IN THE

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:20.003
OCEANS AND IT'S NICE TO HEAR --

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.506
EDUCATED PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT.

00:47:22.573 --> 00:47:24.308
AND HOW WE CAN --

00:47:24.374 --> 00:47:25.976
MEDICAID IN SOME WAYS SO I I'M

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:27.578
JUST A FEW QUESTIONS --

00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:29.947
IN ANY KIND OF ALLUDED TO BEFORE

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.615
READY NOT KNOWING BUT DO WE KNOW

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:33.083
WHAT THE U. S. CONTRIBUTION IS

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:35.052
TO THE OVERALL PROBLEM IN THE

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:36.753
OCEAN STARTING WITH LARGE

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.888
PLASTICS BEING.

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.523
ADDED I MEAN I THINK.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.891
A LOT OF CLOSE TO COMMUNITIES --

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:42.025
EMILY COMMUNITIES THAT MATTER

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:44.394
HAVE GOOD SORTING MECHANISMS TO

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:45.262
GET THE PLASTICS --

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:47.364
EITHER RECYCLED OR UNFORTUNATELY

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.766
ONLY 11% I THINK A RECYCLE THE

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:50.267
REST OF IT ARE PUT INTO

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:52.269
LANDFILLS AND AND ELSEWHERE AND

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:53.003
I THINK.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.905
OF THE EASTERN SEABOARD IS

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.441
PROBABLY EQUALLY AS A CONSCIOUS

00:47:57.507 --> 00:47:59.376
AS WE ARE --

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:01.678
BUT WHAT WHAT LITTLE I HAVE SEEN

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:02.746
IN AND AND AND THE WAY A

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:04.681
DOCUMENTARY USES A SHOWING THAT

00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:07.351
ASIA IS A VERY STRONG --

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:08.385
THE MATTER IF YOU WILL OF THE

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:10.187
GROSS PLASTICS INTO OUR OCEANS

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:11.655
AT THE TERRY AND BECOME A

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.223
MICROFIBER SELECTION OF THAT

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.826
NUMBER ONE NUMBER --

00:48:15.892 --> 00:48:18.262
TWO THE TOXICOLOGY OF MICRO

00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:25.002
FIBERS TO HUMANS THE THE THE

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.503
CONCERN THE MICRO FIBERS AYE

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:27.838
AYES I ASSUME FROM MY MY

00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:30.407
BACKGROUND AT THE MICRO FIBERS

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:32.309
ARE NON DIGESTIBLE --

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:34.811
I SOONER JUST EXCRETED BUT MAYBE

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:36.380
THERE IS SOME --

00:48:36.446 --> 00:48:37.814
DANGERS TO HUMANS AND I'D LIKE

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:39.750
TO KNOW ABOUT ANY TOXICOLOGY

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.818
STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN --

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:43.220
DISCUSSED.

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:45.188
AND THE NEW BROUGHT UP THAT THE

00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:47.357
LA AREA WHERE WE PROBABLY DON'T

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.059
REALLY THINK ABOUT VERY MUCH AND

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:50.294
AND THAT IS --

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.263
WASHING THE WASHING MACHINE --

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:55.132
EFFLUENT YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.533
OUR PERMITS TODAY SOME HAVE

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.502
FORMS OF PLASTIC AND AND SOME OF

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:00.270
THESE PLASTIC COFFEE MICRO

00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:01.405
FIBERS ARE MAKING THEIR WAY INTO

00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:02.272
OUR WATER SUPPLY IN THAT WAY

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:02.873
THEY'RE GETTING OUT INTO THE

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:03.707
OCEAN SO.

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:04.941
AND I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC IS

00:49:05.008 --> 00:49:07.110
REALLY NOT REALLY --

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:09.079
AWARE OF THAT AND SO.

00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:10.347
WE HAVE WASHING MACHINES AT YOU

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:11.882
KNOW PROTECT THE ENGINE OF THE

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:13.216
WASHING MACHINES AND DRYERS SO

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:17.487
WHAT WITH --

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:22.059
FILTERS AND WASHING FACTORS TO

00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:23.694
RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM AND YOU

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.495
KNOW YOU CAN PUT A MICRON FILTER

00:49:25.562 --> 00:49:27.230
IN THERE TO YOU KNOW JUST LIKE

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:27.698
WE CAN.

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:29.433
TAKE A LENT OUT OF THE DRYERS TO

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.301
TO MEDICAID THIS THIS PROBLEM

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:32.269
THAT --

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:34.371
MAYBE JUST HASN'T BEEN

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:35.305
ILLUMINATED ENOUGH FOR THE

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:36.373
THOUGHT FOR THE PUBLIC AND

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.375
CERTAINLY THE MANY FACTORS OF

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:40.344
THE MACHINES UNDERSTAND.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.046
YES THANK YOU S. SENATOR AND THE

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:44.548
FIRST OF US AS FAR AS THE UNITED

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:46.616
STATES CONTRIBUTION I DON'T HAVE

00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:48.352
THOSE EXACT NUMBERS NOW I CAN

00:49:48.418 --> 00:49:50.087
CERTAINLY AND LOOK FOR THOSE.

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:52.589
I I WOULD NOTE THAT AND THEY'VE

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:54.424
PROBABLY CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.827
SINCE CHINA STOPPED ACCEPTING A

00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:58.395
MOST OF OUR RECYCLABLES AN

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:00.230
ANSWER NOW OUR WASTE STREAM

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:02.065
DIVERSION IS IS VERY DIFFERENT

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.066
THAN IT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:05.302
YEARS AGO AND OUR IMPACT ON THE

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:06.136
ENVIRONMENT.

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.604
AND ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.439
AND YOU KNOW THAT THE IMPACTS

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:10.941
FROM CHINA MAY BE DIFFERENT AS

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:12.776
WELL SO -- I

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:16.113
CAN LOOK INTO THAT FOR YOU AND

00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:18.582
IN TERMS OF THE I I AM GOING TO

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:20.417
DEFER TO DOCTOR STEEL ON THE

00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:22.319
DANGERS OF PLASTICS HUMANS AND

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:23.720
AND HOW THEY INTERACT.

00:50:23.787 --> 00:50:25.222
WITH THE HUMAN BODY THAT IS ONE

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.857
OF THE STUDIES THAT WERE WERE

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:28.625
FINDING RIGHT NOW BUT I DON'T

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:29.292
KNOW THE RESULTS.

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:34.097
AND AND AS FAR AS AS WASHING

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:36.433
THAT THAT IS DEFINITELY THE AND

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.301
A POPULAR IDEA RIGHT NOW AND

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.036
SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN CONTACTED

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:42.305
AT IF YOU SEE ABOUT.

00:50:42.372 --> 00:50:45.675
AND AS WE DO OUR AS WE ROLL OUT

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:47.477
OR PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:50.147
PROPOSALS AND COMPETITIVE GRANT --

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:51.882
ARE IF HE'S THERE WILL PROBABLY

00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:54.317
INCLUDE THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES

00:50:54.384 --> 00:50:55.252
TO SEE WHAT KINDS OF

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:57.487
TECHNOLOGIES ARE OUT THERE TO

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:59.990
REALLY FACILITATE AND THAT

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.324
MEDICATION ASPECT.

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:02.793
YEAH I'M I'M JUST AS CONCERNED

00:51:02.859 --> 00:51:04.628
AS YOU ARE WITH --

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.329
CHINA LONGER EXPECTED --

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:08.498
ACCEPTING OUR PLASTICS --

00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:09.666
SO.

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:10.967
THERE WAS EVER A TIME TO YOU

00:51:11.034 --> 00:51:12.269
KNOW REALLY ADDRESS THE THE

00:51:12.335 --> 00:51:13.937
ECYCLING EFFORTS UNDER WAY IN

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.672
AND WE HAVE SOME BILLS THAT

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:16.840
WE'RE GONNA BE ENTERTAINING THIS

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:19.476
YEAR DUE. TO INCREASE EVER SAY

00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:21.211
11% IS JUST DEPLORABLE LOW WE WE

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:23.046
WILL AND WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.648
A BETTER SYSTEM --

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:25.749
TO CERTAINLY --

00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:27.017
TAKE THE THE PLASTICS OF OUR

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:28.118
LANDFILLS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:29.419
CLASSIC STONED AND UP INTO.

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:30.987
INTO OUR OCEANS AND SO I LOOK

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:32.155
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:37.828
COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT WE WE

00:51:37.894 --> 00:51:38.462
EFFECTUATE SOME SOME LEADERSHIP

00:51:38.528 --> 00:51:41.465
IN THE SAME.

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:43.166
WE GOT A A BIGELOW BE A LOT OF

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.367
WATER WE HAVE A LOT OF COUNTRIES

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:45.702
THAT DON'T HAVE THE

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:46.536
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP THAT

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:46.837
THAT.

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.271
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HERE IN

00:51:48.338 --> 00:51:50.874
THE UNITED STATES AND WE NEED TO

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.843
DO WE CAN TO AS AS A GLOBAL

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:53.877
COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:54.644
PROBLEM --

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:58.281
THAT YOU HAVE OF ARTICULATION IS

00:51:58.348 --> 00:52:00.050
VERY PERVASIVE.

00:52:00.116 --> 00:52:01.284
THANK YOU THERE WILL BE

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:02.419
OPPORTUNITY.

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.855
WE'RE JUST ON THAT LATER TODAY --

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:06.056
CENTER JACKSON MANSON COPIER

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.391
HERE -- AND

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:09.392
TO KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:10.861
STEWARDSHIP CALIFORNIA TENDS TO

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:12.629
LEAD THE WAY SO I THINK IT'S

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:13.763
IMPORTANT THAT WE BE.

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.131
OUT THERE FIRST IF IF WE

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:17.267
POSSIBLY CAN AND WITH THAT IN

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:18.301
MIND -- I

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:22.739
I'M WORKING ON THIS WHOLE ISSUE

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:24.908
OF FARM --

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:25.842
IT UNDER A BILL THAT I'VE

00:52:25.909 --> 00:52:26.810
INTRODUCED SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:27.944
ON EXTENDED PRODUCER

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:28.879
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:30.514
AND WE DID A BILL LAST YEAR DID

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.182
A BILL LAST YEAR.

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:34.718
ON APR --

00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:37.654
FOUR DRUGS AND SHARPS AND I

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:39.623
THINK IT'S A MODEL THAT WE MIGHT

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:41.391
BE ABLE TO EXPAND HERE THE TEST

00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:43.293
SAYS TO THE PRODUCERS OF THESE

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.361
PRODUCTS LOOK FOLKS.

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:46.096
YOU CAN'T JUST MANUFACTURE THEM

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:48.999
pTHERE'S THE END OF LIFE CYCLE

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:51.001
THAT IS REALLY CREATING.

00:52:51.067 --> 00:52:53.737
SERIOUS PROBLEMS SO I WONDER.

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:55.505
WITH THAT IN MIND IF YOU HAVE

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:57.774
ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT IN EP OUR

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:00.510
APPROACH THAT IF YOU'RE AWARE OF

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:01.578
THE THE BASICALLY WHAT WE DID

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:03.146
LAST YEAR WITH THE THE

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:04.614
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WE SEE

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:05.882
SAID HERE'S THE GOAL.

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:07.484
YOU'VE GOT TO YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.919
BACK THESE END OF PRODUCTS AT

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:10.053
THE END OF THEIR LIVES AND

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.454
YOU'VE GOT TO DISPOSE OF THEM.

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:13.490
AND DO IT WITHOUT CHARGING THE

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:16.626
CONSUMER FOR IT --

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:17.460
AND YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT.

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.395
AND BASICALLY WE SET THOSE

00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:20.163
PARAMETERS AND NOBODY KNOWS

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:21.665
THEIR BUSINESS I WOULD SUGGEST

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:23.533
BETTER THAN NAY AND SO THEY WERE

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.502
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:27.671
THERE WAS CIGARETTE ****.

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:28.838
AND FRANKLY.

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.307
WHEN WE DO OUR CLEAN UP DAYS

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:31.441
THERE'S NO QUESTION BUT WHAT THE

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:33.343
NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF POLLUTION

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.045
IS OUT THERE IT'S CIGARETTE ****?

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:36.580
AND THOSE FILTERS THE CELLULOSE

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:40.216
FILTER A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM I

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:41.651
I BELIEVE THEY CONTAIN

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.320
CARCINOGENIC MATERIALS THERE

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.788
THEY ARE IN OUR BEACHES THE

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:47.324
WILDLIFE WILL INGESTED THE

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.993
MARINE LIFE AND JUST SAID --

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.795
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:54.264
WE ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AS WELL

00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:56.366
AS THE MORE OBVIOUS PLASTIC AND

00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:57.534
EVEN MICRO.

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:59.536
PLASTICA ELEMENTS --

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:01.504
BUT CERTAINLY IS CIGARETTE ****

00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:03.340
ARE AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM AND ONE

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:04.808
THAT PERHAPS WE CAN ADDRESS

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:07.577
THROUGH THE E. P. R. PROCESS TO

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:12.816
SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT.

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:14.651
KLAY YET CLEARLY CIGARETTE ****

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:15.785
ARE -- AS

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:17.287
YOU MENTIONED THE NUMBER ONE

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:18.321
ITEM THAT'S PICKED UP IN COASTAL

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:20.490
CLEANUP DAYS AND ARE PERVASIVE

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:22.759
THROUGHOUT OUR BEACHES SO AND I

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:24.995
THINK A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:25.862
TO ADDRESSING.

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.564
PLASTICS IS GONNA BE THE MOST

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:32.302
IMPORTANT AND ONE THAT IS THAT

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:32.602
[inaudible]

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:33.970
SCIENTIFICALLY.

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:36.806
VALID IN REAL FAST AND THAT --

00:54:36.873 --> 00:54:39.075
IS IMPLEMENTABLE AND SCALABLE SO

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:41.411
YOU MIGHT NEED TO START AT A AT

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:43.213
A LOCAL LEVEL AND BUILD UP OR

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:44.547
STARTED A STATE LEVEL AND BILL

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:45.582
THAT NATIONALLY OR

00:54:45.649 --> 00:54:46.549
INTERNATIONALLY.

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:48.451
BUT AT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE

00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:49.686
NEED TO BE TAKING.

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:52.656
A MUCH BROADER APPROACH THEN --

00:54:52.722 --> 00:54:55.291
JUST ITEM BY ITEM BECAUSE EVERY

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:56.893
TIME WE ADDRESS ONE ITEM ANOTHER

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.128
ONE WILL POP UP.

00:54:58.194 --> 00:55:00.363
DO YOU THINK IF WE IF I MAY TO

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:03.900
THE CHAIR WHO --

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:05.869
CREATE THIS KIND OF U. P. R.

00:55:05.935 --> 00:55:08.204
SYSTEM STARTING WITH CIGARETTE

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:09.939
**** OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.

00:55:10.006 --> 00:55:11.875
THAT IT WOULD BE APPLICABLES

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:14.711
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS I

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.179
MEAN IF THE THE WITH THE GRADE

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:18.415
THESE THESE PRODUCTS TO GRADE

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:20.283
EITHER NATURALLY OR THEY

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.384
RETAINED.

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:22.519
WHAT WAS IT SOME?

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:24.387
WAS A WHALE THAT WAS JUST CAUGHT

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:30.427
AND HAD EIGHTY POUNDS OF PLASTIC

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:31.995
IN ITS BELLY MEANS.

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.630
ARE YOU SHOW THE SLIDE OF THAT

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:34.631
YET I MEAN THAT TERRIBLY.

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:35.932
UNSETTLING TO KNOW THAT THE AND

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.934
I THINK THAT I I'D RATHER SEE US

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:42.105
USING THE WHAT IS IT THE LITTLE.

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:46.009
TRASH WHEELS OF THEN ARE --

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:47.243
YOU KNOW MAMMAL LIFE OUR MARINE

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.344
MAMMAL LIKE BUT I'M JUST

00:55:48.411 --> 00:55:49.446
WONDERING IF THERE'S SOME

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:52.982
DIRECTION AGAIN WE TEND TO LEAD.

00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:53.583
I KNOW --

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.551
CENTER WHITE HOUSE HE'S BEEN BIG

00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:56.252
ON THE EPR ISSUE I'M JUST

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:56.986
WONDERING IF YOU HAVE SOME

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:58.655
SUGGESTIONS YOU MENTION A

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:00.356
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH.

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:01.825
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I MEAN IS

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:04.027
THERE SOME SOME HELP YOU CAN

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:06.396
GIVE US HERE IN THIS?

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:11.267
CONCEPT.

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:13.470
AND I THINK WHAT WOULD WOULD BE

00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:14.838
MOST EFFECTIVE IS IF WE COULD

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:16.239
SET UP A MEETING WITH YOU AND

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:18.775
I'M TALK IN DEPTH ABOUT KIND OF

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:22.645
WHAT WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE AND AND

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:24.114
OBVIOUSLY I I CAN'T TAKE A

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.582
POSITION ON ANY SORT OF

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:26.649
LEGISLATION I'M HERE.

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:27.984
AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION SO

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:30.754
I FEEL A LITTLE CONSTRAINED AND

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.188
BY LAW I'M NOT IT YOU KNOW IT

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:34.124
YEAH CAN WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY --

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:37.160
VETTED THE THE THE IN SUGGEST

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:38.328
RACE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BUT

00:56:38.394 --> 00:56:40.063
PERHAPS A CONFERENCE THAT

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.431
CONVERSATION WOULD BE HELPFUL I

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:42.599
WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT FROM

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:44.534
MY PERSPECTIVE MISTER CHAIRS.

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:46.402
I THINK WE I THINK THERE'S THE

00:56:46.469 --> 00:56:48.471
CASE IS WELL ESTABLISHED THIS IS

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:49.973
A REALLY BAD PROBLEM THE THE

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:52.142
PLASTICS THE ISSUE IS AS YOU

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:53.343
SUGGESTED WITH YOUR PRIOR

00:56:53.409 --> 00:56:53.610
QUESTION.

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:55.278
HOW DO WE SOLVE IT I THINK

00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:57.413
THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO BE GOING

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.381
NEXT?

00:56:58.448 --> 00:56:59.783
I THINK IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE

00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:00.784
THING WHAT ONE OF THAT AND THE

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:03.019
TOPICS I MENTIONED BEFORE AND A

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:04.420
LITTLE EARLIER WAS.

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:08.091
AND THIS IDEA OF MOVING TO

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:08.992
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRODUCTS

00:57:09.058 --> 00:57:10.193
PRODUCTS IN MOVING AWAY FROM

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.962
PETROLEUM BASED PLASTIC PRODUCTS --

00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:14.697
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:16.833
RESEARCH AND A LOT OF INNOVATION

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.002
THAT'S GOING ON AND THAT WE

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:20.403
COULD BE SUPPORTING.

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:23.773
AND THAT WOULD MOVE US AWAY FROM

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.776
THE THE PERSISTENT PLASTICS AND

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:27.944
TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT IS MORE

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:29.546
EASILY COMPOSTABLE OR OR DEGREE

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:33.616
TO PAUL.

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:34.184
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.553
SAN ANTONIO.

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:37.387
THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:38.955
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:42.325
SOME OF THE OTHER --

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:44.427
PRODUCTS THAT MAKE THAT MADE.

00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:45.762
PROVE FRUITFUL IN GOOD FOR

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.697
CALIFORNIA AT AT SOME OTHER TIME

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:49.833
BUT MY MY ISSUE THE ISSUE THAT'S

00:57:49.899 --> 00:57:52.302
BEEN RAISED --

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:53.937
TO ME RECENTLY IS.

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:56.406
NOW THAT TRYING IS NOT TAKING

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:58.441
PLASTIC IS THE THE NEED FOR

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.610
STRAWBERRY GROWERS TO GET RID OF

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:01.744
THE PLASTIC THEY THEY PUT ON THE

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:03.446
GROUND IN ORDER TO KEEP THE

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:05.548
PLANTS --

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:07.784
SAFE I THEY USUALLY ROLL IT UP

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:09.285
AND THE IT WAS PART OF THE

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:10.720
SHIPMENT TO CHINA IT CAN NO

00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:11.955
LONGER GO AND SO.

00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:13.289
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR

00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:15.892
HANDS IT'S IT'S DIRTY PLASTIC

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:17.694
IT'S GOT A LOT OF DIRT IN IT.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:21.097
AND AND THERE'S NO PLACE TO PUT

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:23.566
IT AND IT'S LOCATED IN ON OUR

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:25.802
CENTRAL CAST REGION SO --

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.470
IT WE NEED TO KIND OF PUT THAT

00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:29.305
UP ON THE RADAR SCREEN I'M TOLD

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:32.575
THAT THERE IS A COMPANY THAT --

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:35.311
THAT DOES DISPOSE OF IT AND IT

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:37.513
MAY BE AN INCINERATION TYPE OF

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.916
OF PRODUCT --

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:41.384
BUT I I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:42.385
ABOUT IT SO IF THERE'S IF YOU

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:43.386
HAVE ANY INFORMATION I'D BE

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:04.780
I WANT TO FOCUS ON ON PLASTICS

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:07.183
WHEN WE LOOK IN AGGREGATE AT THE

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.418

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:11.187
THAT CAUSE DISTRESS AND DISEASE

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.122
FOR OUR ANIMALS POPULIST IS

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:14.257
MALNUTRITION.

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:16.025
THERE IS A CATEGORY ABOUT 10% OF

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:17.960
OUR ANIMALS WE CAN ATTRIBUTE THE

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:19.162
HARM.

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.964
DIRECTLY TO HUMAN PRACTICES

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:24.100
WITHIN THAT CATEGORY IS MARINE

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.102
DEBRIS WILL SEE EVERYTHING FROM

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:27.970
ANIMALS AND TANGLED IN FISHING

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:29.939
LINE QUITE COMMONLY. TO

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.742
INGESTION OF PLASTICS --

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:35.745
AND IT'S IT'S ALWAYS VERY

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:38.514
DISTURBING FINDING.

OTHERS HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.170
WHAT WE DO AND WE DON'T KNOW

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:43.139
ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF THOSE

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:46.208
PLASTICS AS A GRANTED.

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:47.543
A DIGESTIVE TRACT SUB LETHAL

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.211
EFFECTS MAY COMPROMISE FEEDING

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:50.813
AN ASSOCIATE MALNUTRITION.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.850
DISEASE AND REDUCED REPRODUCTION

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.419
AND GROWTH AND LONGEVITY.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:57.653
SO DISTURBING THINGS JUST FROM

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.088
ONE GROUP OF MARINE ANIMALS

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:00.923
ALONE THOSE PAYING MARINE

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:03.259
MAMMALS.

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:05.061
SO AS A CABBIE OUT TO THE NEXT

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:06.762
FOR IMAGES THAT I'M GOING TO

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:07.730
SHOW YOU NOT BECAUSE OUR

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.399
HORRIFIC BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.867
WHAT WE CALL CHARISMATIC

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:13.636
MEGAFAUNA THESE ARE?

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.204
THE BIG ANIMALS THAT GET OUR

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.606
ATTENTION AND AND I WOULD ARGUE

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:18.607
THAT -- THEY

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.743
DO AS A SERVER SERVICE IN DOING

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.211
THAT THEY THEY ARE ATTRACTIVE

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.447
THEY ARE CONVERSATION STARTERS

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:26.482
STATE TO ATTRACT THE IN IN

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:27.917
GENDER AND ILLICIT.

01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:29.552
THE GOOD WILL OF PEOPLE IN AN

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:31.220
INCREDIBLE WAY THIS IS THE WIND

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:34.857
MONK SEAL IS ONE OF THE IMAGES

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:35.257
THAT UPPER SHOWED.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:39.261
AS WELL ROLL ON THE BIG ISLAND

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.996
BACK IN.

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:41.530
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN MANY

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:43.666
STRESSES BASE THIS SPECIES ARE

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:46.268
ONLY THIRTEEN ANIMALS THIRTEEN

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.937
HUNDRED ANIMALS ALIVE IT'S

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.505
EXTRAORDINARILY ENDANGERED

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:52.942
SPECIES ONE OF THE THREATS IS IN

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:53.142
FACT.

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:57.079
MARINE DEBRIS.

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:58.814
A WHALE SHARK --

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.483
SEEMINGLY IN THIS IMAGE ABOUT TO

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:02.118
GOBBLED DOWN A PLASTIC BAG WITH

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:03.986
A MARINE DEBRIS FLOATING ALL

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:06.689
ABOUT ABOVE IT WHALE SHARKS IF

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:07.656
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEM ARE

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:09.425
FILTER FEEDERS.

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:11.060
THERE WERE MOVING THROUGH THE

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.562
WATER UP AT THE SERVICE WERE A

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:14.930
LOT OF THESE PLASTICS WILL

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:16.832
AGGREGATE SO THEY'RE BASICALLY

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:18.434
FILTERING IN AND TAKING IN

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.269
POTENTIALLY A WHOLE LOT OF

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:22.505
MARINE DEBRIS.

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:24.140
PLASTICS PACIFIC LEAD.

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:25.040
DOCTOR AL DOVE DOWN AT THE

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:27.076
GEORGIA AQUARIUM IN ATLANTA

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:28.611
TAKING CARE THE WHALE SHARKS IN

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:29.879
THEIR CARE BUT HE'S ALSO DOING

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:32.081
FIELD WORK EXTENSIVELY AROUND

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:32.982
THE WORLD.

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:35.217
GETTING BLOOD FROM WILD ANIMALS

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:37.052
TRYING TO CORRELATE WHAT HE'S

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.521
SEEING IN THOSE BLOOD SAMPLES

01:07:38.587 --> 01:07:40.623
WITH WHAT THEY ARE INGESTING

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:44.260
FROM OTHER SAMPLES THAT THEIR

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.595
OBTAINING.

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:47.830
SEE TURTLES I I DIDN'T WANT TO

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.031
PUT THE THE PHOTO OF THIS

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:50.666
ETERNAL WITH THE STRAW IN ITS

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.301
NOSE IN HERE.

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:54.236
BY THAT BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU ALL

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:55.938
SAW IT BUT YOU YOU YOU JUST

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.373
GOOGLE SEA TURTLES PLASTIC AND

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.541
IS PRETTY HORRIFYING WHAT YOU

01:07:58.607 --> 01:07:59.408
WHAT YOU SEE.

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:00.876
DAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:02.711
CLASSIC --

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:04.847
CHALLENGE OF AN ANIMAL THAT FOR

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:07.383
EONS HAS BEEN A HARD WIRED TO

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.551
LOOK AT SOMETHING FLOATING IN

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:09.919
THE WATER COLUMN.

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:12.054
OF THE LOOK AND SHAPE OF A

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.389
PLASTIC BAG AND THINK IT'S A

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:14.757
SQUID IN GOBLET DOWN --

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.859
IMPACTED BY PLASTICS IN IN A

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:22.965
SEVERE AND AND SIGNIFICANT WAY.

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.567
AND THIS TOO IS IS NOT IMAGE

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.368
THAT I THINK WOULD BE UNFAMILIAR

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:27.670
TO YOU ALL --

01:08:27.736 --> 01:08:29.171
CELEBRATED ISN'T THE RIGHT WORD

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:31.040
A TORY THIS IS A BETTER WORD AT

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.942
THE IMAGES THAT COME OUT OF THE

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:36.479
NORTHWEST HAWAIIAN ISLANDS --

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:39.748
WHERE ALBATROSS OUR OUR WE WILL

01:08:39.815 --> 01:08:42.184
FOR THE IMPACT OF OF PLASTICS ON

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:44.353
WILDLIFE I THINK IT WAS PART OF

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.621
WHAT --

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:46.956
SPURRED --

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:48.557
DAVID ATTENBOROUGH TO TWO

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.459
DECLARED THE THE IMMENSITY OF

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:51.494
THE PROBLEM WITH PLASTICS A

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.895
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AS HE WAS

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.797
CITING WHAT HE WAS WITNESSING

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:55.731
WITH --

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.633
ALBATROSS IS COMING BACK TO TO

01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:00.736
PROVIDE LET'S DO OF THINGS LIKE

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:05.474
THIS. TO THEIR CHECKS.

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.409
SO MACRO PLASTICS MICRO PLASTICS

01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:09.879
AB HAVE BEEN --

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:10.446
DISCUSSED HERE THIS MORNING

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:11.514
ALREADY.

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.948
SENATOR STERN HAD ASKED THAT THE

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.884
VERY VERY APPROPRIATE QUESTION

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:17.453
OF WHERE IT IS THE SCIENCE IN

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.354
AND MY MY COLLEAGUE I'M TO MY

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.622
RIGHT MIGHT MAY HAVE MORE

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:20.923
INFORMATION ON THIS.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:24.426
FROM WHERE I SIT THE THERE'S SO

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.462
MUCH BETTER AND UNDERSTANDING OF

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.464
THE IMPACT ON WILDLIFE FROM A

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.532
MACRO.

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.000
PERSPECTIVE.

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:32.067
AND YET I I SAID IN AN

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:33.602
ORGANIZATION WHERE WE SEE

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:34.937
HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS EACH AND

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.572
EVERY YEAR --

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:38.440
WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE DEATHS

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:40.409
OF THOSE ANIMALS FOR THE

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:41.844
PROXIMATE CAUSE.

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:44.113
BUT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US AS A

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:47.316
STUDY RESOURCE A SAMPLE RESOURCE

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.251
OF A AMEND CITY AND

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:50.686
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS THIS IS

01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:52.955
MY AND MY MY CHALLENGE MYSELF.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.324
NEED TO ALLY WITH OTHER

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.792
INVESTIGATORS TO START

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.761
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS TRANSITING

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:01.096
TO THE GUTS OF ANIMALS WHATEVER

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:02.464
THEIR OTHER BECAUSE OF DISEASE

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:03.532
MIGHT BE.

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:07.903
AND HOW DO WE GET TO UNDERSTAND

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.505
BEING THAT'S BEING ABSORBED BY

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:10.739
THOSE ANIMALS.

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:13.309
AND OR OTHER EFFECTS OF OF THEIR

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.010
PRESENCE IT'S NOT WELL

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.579
UNDERSTOOD FROM WHERE I SIT YET

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:17.646
AND NOW.

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:19.481
ANY ONE OF US WOULD SAY THIS

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:22.418
CANNOT BE GOOD.

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.086
SO PLASTICS IMPACT IN THIS IS IN

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:25.721
CLOSING IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.356
THREATS TO MARINE WILDLIFE THE

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:29.625
THREATS ARE MANY TO MARINE

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:32.027
WILDLIFE'S THE THE SAMPLE WE SEE

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:33.395
IS SPECIFICALLY MARINE MAMMALS

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:35.664
ON THE WEST COAST WHERE WE SEE.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:39.034
MALNUTRITION FACTS DISEASES

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:39.735
CANCER EVEN [inaudible]

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:41.403
AND YET.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.739
THE ISSUE OF PLASTICS IS ONE

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:45.708
WHERE IT SEEMS.

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.209
WE HAVE THE THE MOST CLEAR

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:50.279
RESPONSIBILITY AND AND PERHAPS

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:52.481
HAVE THE THE THE POLITICAL WILL

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:53.816
BECAUSE OF THAT AND BECAUSE OF

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:56.685
THE CHARISMA OF THESE ANIMALS.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:57.987
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO --

01:10:58.053 --> 01:10:59.588
THESE OTHER THESE OTHER ISSUES

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:00.789
THAT WE FACE IN CARING FOR

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:01.824
MARINE MAMMALS.

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.292
ARE GOING TO OCCUR THERE IS

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:04.860
ALWAYS GOING TO BE MALNUTRITION

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.228
BASED ON THE AND THE DIVERSITY

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.497
OF SEASONS IN THE PLENTY OR LACK

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:10.099
OF FOOD.

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:11.634
RESOURCES THERE'S ALWAYS GOING

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.202
TO BE INFECTIOUS DISEASES THIS

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:16.572
IS A MAN MADE ISSUE THAT WE

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.073
INTRODUCED.

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.608
WITHIN THE LAST --

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:21.210
HUNDRED PLUS YEARS WE OUGHT TO

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:22.344
BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING TO

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:25.347
ADDRESS IT.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:26.749
AND I WILL CLOSE THEIR WITH A

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:28.550
APPRECIATION FOR THE

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:29.151

THIS PART INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.504
TO PLASTIC POLLUTION. FOR A

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.273
THROW AWAY FREE WORLD.

AND HI I WANT TO TURN FROM THE

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:23.338
BOMBER OF THE PROBLEM TOO I'M

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:25.874
MORE OPTIMISTIC VIEW --

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:27.509
FOCUSING ON THE SOLUTIONS --

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:29.945
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON SOLUTIONS.

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.313
AND HOW WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.515
EVER SINCE --

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:34.049
WHEN I WAS WORKING AT THE

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:37.052
CALIFORNIA CO I RAN INTO CAPTAIN

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.121
CHARLES MOORE AFTER HIS FIRST

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.856
DIRE JOURNEY INTO THE PACIFIC

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:42.691
OCEAN -- AND

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.059
FOUND AND HE SHOWED ME AS

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:45.561
SAMPLES WHERE YOU FOUND SIX

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:47.896
TIMES MORE PLASTIC THAN PLANKTON.

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:49.231
ON THE SURFACE OF THE PACIFIC

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.667
OCEAN AND EVER SINCE THEN THAT

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:53.435
WAS LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE FOR

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:55.003
ME AND EVER SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.172
WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR THE

01:12:57.239 --> 01:12:59.174
LAST FIFTEEN YEARS --

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:01.777
MOVING FROM THE STATE TO THE NGO

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:04.813
COMMUNITY AND SEEKING SOLUTIONS

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.583
ON I BEFORE I MOVED OVER --

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:09.351
TO TALKING ABOUT UNPLUGGING

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:10.652
CALIFORNIA'S WHAT IS FROM

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.755
PLASTIC ILLNESS SAY WE'VE BEEN

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:15.190
FOCUSING A LOT TODAY ON THE

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:16.225
PROBLEM IN THE MARINE

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:17.760
ENVIRONMENT BUT THERE ARE

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:19.294
QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH.

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:22.064
AND I WON OFFERED THIS --

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.565
THIS ISN'T JUST A PROBLEM IN THE

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:24.867
MARINE ENVIRONMENT PLASTICS

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:27.336
SURRENDERING OUR FOOD CHAIN --

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:29.238
NOT JUST FROM SEAFOOD IT'S IN

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:31.406
ALL MANY OTHER FOOD SOURCES IT'S

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:32.808
IN THE AIR WE BREATHE IT'S IN

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.643
OUR TOP WATER IT'S AN R. BOTTLED

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:39.848
WATER -- AND

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.216
SO -- IRVING

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:42.117
TOWARDS FIGURING OUT HOW OLD

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.252
THIS IS EFFECTING A PUBLIC

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.286
HEALTH THERE'S ALSO HUNDREDS OF

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:44.920
CHEMICALS --

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.155
THAT OUR ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:48.657
AND CARCINOGENS IN PLASTICS AND

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:51.026
IN FOOD PACKAGING TO THAT END UP

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.361
STREAM IS CONVENING.

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:54.229
AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:56.498
JUNE ON LAUNCHING TO SCIENTIFIC

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.300
CONSENSUS STATEMENTS ABOUT THE

01:13:58.367 --> 01:13:59.735
HEALTH EFFECTS OF PLASTICS

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:01.370
THEMSELVES AND MICRO AND NANO

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:02.671
PLASTICS --

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:04.406
AS WELL AS FOOD PACKAGING

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:06.642
CHEMICALS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.177
TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES ON

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.579
ORGANIZING A PANEL ON THE HUMAN

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:13.482
HEALTH EFFECTS OF FOOD PACKAGING

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:15.884
CHEMICALS AND PLASTICS --

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:18.520
BUT TODAY WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:24.660
SOLUTIONS AND TO MACRO PLASTICS --

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:25.594
FIRST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:28.197
ORGANIZATION WE ARE --

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:29.765
WE'RE FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:31.533
AND THREE IS THE PRODUCT POLICY

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.268
INSTITUTE WE FOCUSED ON WHAT W

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.237
DO WITH PRODUCTS AT THE END OF

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.039
THEIR USEFUL LIFE AND WE WERE

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:38.540
PROMOTING EXTENDED PRODUCER

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.809
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL KINDS OF

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.477
PRODUCT CATEGORIES --

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:45.414
AND SUCCESSFULLY AND A HELP

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.982
FOUND THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.051
STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND HAVE

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:51.887
BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY EPR LAWS --

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:54.256
BUT WHEN WE GOT TO THE PLASTICS

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:55.290
AND PACKAGING IT.

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:59.228
HAS BECOME CLEAR TO US THAT IF

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:00.929
MANAGEMENT APPROACH JUST DOESN'T

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:01.797
REALLY --

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.632
IT'S NOT THE BEST APPROACH FOR

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:05.133
PRODUCTS THAT WE USE IN A MATTER

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.135
OF MINUTES AND THAT HAVE

01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:09.504
ENORMOUS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:11.573
FROM THE EXTRACTION OF RESOURCES

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.709
TO THEIR CARBON AND CLIMATE

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:16.378
FOOTPRINT TO THEN THE TOXICS AND

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:18.013
PLASTIC POLLUTION.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.615
THAT WE END UP WITH --

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:22.217
SO WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING MORE ON

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:24.820
HOW TO WE OF UPSTREAM LOOK AT

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.355
THESE PRODUCTS AND DEVELOP

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:29.024
BETTER POLICIES AND THAT ENTAILS --

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.959
REALLY CHANGING MARK THROWAWAY

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.127
CULTURE.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.562
AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.998
SUGGESTING ARE HOW WE SOLVE

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:37.532
THESE PROBLEMS --

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:38.901
LOOKING AT IT FROM A CALIFORNIA

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:41.470
PERSPECTIVE WE REALLY ALL OF OUR

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:43.538
SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE SCIENCE

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:45.407
BASED AND GUIDED BY DATA AND SO

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:47.109
THE BACK AS THE OPC LITTER

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.411
STRATEGY ACKNOWLEDGES THE BEST

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.880
DATA SET THAT WE HAVE IS THE

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:54.016
DECADES WORTH OF CALIFORNIA

01:15:54.082 --> 01:15:55.250
COASTAL CLEANUP --

01:15:55.317 --> 01:16:00.389
DATA AND FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:00.989
EIGHT TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:01.657
TOP TEN PRODUCTS ARE ARE LISTED

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:02.658
HERE.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:03.825
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT CIGARETTE

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:05.661
**** ARE NUMBER ONE THEY ALWAYS

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:07.095
HAVE BEEN --

01:16:07.162 --> 01:16:09.131
BUT SEVEN OUT OF THE TEN TOP

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:11.300
PRODUCTS OR FOOD AND BEVERAGE

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:14.169
PACKAGING RELATED --

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:16.271
AND SO WHAT DO WE REALLY NEED TO

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:17.973
BE LOOKING AT THOSE PRODUCTS AS

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.010
A WHOLE ALL RATHER THAN TRYING

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:23.145
TO PICK OFF.

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:23.812
ONE MEAN A ONE PRODUCT AT A TIME

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:24.813
AND DEVELOPING MORE

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.449
COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES I WANT

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.150
TO POINT OUT THAT --

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:28.717
SO I'VE --

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:31.920
PUT IN READ ALL THAT ARE --

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:33.855
FOOD AND BEVERAGE RELATED --

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:35.524
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT --

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:38.026
WHILE BAGS WERE NUMBER FOUR IN

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:40.729
THAT TIME PERIOD AS OF TWENTY

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:41.997
EIGHTEEN BAGS ARE NO LONGER IN

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:43.932
THE TOP TEN AND THAT IS A

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:46.335
DEMONSTRATION THAT THAT POLICY

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:47.202
THAT WAS --

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.737
THAT EMERGE FROM THE GROUND UP

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:49.805
THAT WAS STARTED IN SAN

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:52.074
FRANCISCO IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:52.607
SEVEN THE BAG.

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:55.310
PLASTIC BAG BAN AND THE CHARGE

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:57.179
THAT WORKS THAT SON YOU KNOW AS

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:58.780
AS YOU ALL KNOW IT'S A STATEWIDE

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:00.449
POLICY NOW --

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:03.518
AND AND THAT IS A GOOD CASE --

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:05.787
FOR HOW TRANSITIONING TO RE USE

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:07.622
AND PREVENTION --

01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:09.391
AND BANDS OFTEN ARE A VERY

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.159
HELPFUL SOLUTION --

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:13.228
SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE NEED TO

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.496
BE LOOKING AT THE STATUS THAT WE

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:16.131
NEED TO PRIORITIZE CIGARETTE

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.065
****.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.534
AND AND CAPS AS A SEPARATE ISSUE

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:20.969
BECAUSE THERE'S A GOOD SOLUTION

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:24.740
FOR THEM AND FOOD WHERE AS A

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:25.173
GENERAL.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.375
ISSUE AND THEN MICRO FIBERS ARE

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:28.910
NOT COUNTED OBVIOUSLY IN COASTAL

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:31.346
CLEANUP BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:32.981
SMALL THEIR MICRO THANK YOU --

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:34.750
BUT THEY ARE THEY HAVE EMERGED

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:36.451
AS ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:38.687
AREA WHERE WE NEED SOLUTIONS.

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:42.090
SO AS WE CRAFT SOLUTIONS WHAT

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.625
WHAT IS A FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:47.062
ABOUT THE BEST SOLUTIONS --

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:48.930
FOR THESE PRIORITY PRODUCTS AND

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:50.399
LET ME SUGGEST THIS IS A

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:52.434
FRAMEWORK THAT WAS ALSO --

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.002
REITERATED IN THE OCEAN LATER

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:56.304
STRATEGY BECAUSE THERE'S GENERAL

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.140
AGREEMENT AMONGST OF THE PLASTIC

01:17:58.206 --> 01:17:59.708
POLLUTION COMMUNITY AND THE

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:01.977
REGULATORS ON THIS APPROACH.

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:03.812
ON A VERY MUCH HAILS FROM MORE

01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:05.113
THREE OURS --

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.215
SOLID WASTE HIERARCHY THE IDEA

01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:09.184
THAT WE SHOULD REDUCE AND

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.520
PREVENT AS MUCH OF THIS SINGLE

01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:14.756
USE THROW AWAY STUFF AS POSSIBLE

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:15.991
AND THEN WORRY ABOUT --

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:17.793
AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:18.927
WITH THE REST OF IT.

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:20.228
SO SOURCE REDUCTION OR

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:21.997
PREVENTION STRATEGIES INCLUDE

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:23.298
PRODUCT BANS.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:26.001
MINIMIZING SINGLE USE AND REUSE

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:29.371
OR REDUCTION SORRY MESS THAT AND

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:29.704
THEN --

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.740
SECOND THEN AFTER WE'VE DONE

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.141
THAT AND THAT COULD INCLUDE

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.077
THINGS LIKE MINIMIZING

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.912
DISPOSABLE PACKAGING LIKE IN ASK

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:39.114
FIRST POLICY FOR STRAWS OR

01:18:39.181 --> 01:18:41.550
REPLACING DISPOSABLES WITH

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:42.984
REUSABLE AS AS ARE BAD --

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:49.958
POLICY HAS DONE AND AND CHARGING

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:51.793
FOR CHARGING FOR PRODUCTS BUT

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.028
FOR THOSE THAT WE CAN'T REDUCE

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.029
THEN THERE ARE THE CONTROL

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:55.797
MEASURES LIKE A GOOD WASTE

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:57.599
MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.134
LOOKS AT RECYCLING AND

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:01.536
COMPOSTING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:03.839
AND WHEN WE FOCUS ON DISPOSAL WE

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:04.973
NEED -- TO

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:05.740
TO HAVE BETTER GARBAGE

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.776
MANAGEMENT TO PREVENT ILLEGAL

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:09.778
DUMPING AND CONTROLLING --

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:11.179
THIS SCAPE OF TRASH FROM

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:12.814
DUMPSTERS --

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:15.250
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER CONTROL

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:17.018
I WON'T GET INTO BUT LASTLY

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.220
THERE AND THEN THERE'S A CLEAN

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:20.288
UP LAKE STREET WELL ST LITTER

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:22.457
CLEANING AND TRASH CAPTURE

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:23.959
DEVICES IN THE STORM DRAIN.

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:26.228
BUT THE REASON THAT THIS IS LAST

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:27.762
LITTER CLEANUP AND TRASH CAPTURE

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:29.231
IS BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU CLEAN

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:31.233
UP A BEACH OR CLEAN THE STREET A

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:33.235
COUPLE HOURS LATER OR THE NEXT

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:34.503
DAY IT'S RE LITTERED.

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:35.904
SO WE'RE NOT REALLY SOLVING THE

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:37.572
PROBLEM AND WERE PERPETUALLY

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.674
SPENDING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO

01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:41.877
CLEAN IT UP --

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:42.644
IRATE --

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:44.379
DEVER HAS ALLUDED TO ALREADY

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.981
DISCUSSED SOME OF THE STATE

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:46.781
ACTIONS --

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:48.917
SO I'M NOT GOING TO WE DO HAVE

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:49.718
THE STATEWIDE --

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:51.386
STORM WATER REGULATIONS THE

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:53.755
TRASH AMENDMENTS THE FOCUS ON

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:55.390
THAT CONTROLLING CLEAN UP --

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:56.825
APPROACH --

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:59.094
AND W'VE ALSO HAD SOME GREAT

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:01.329
LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA --

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:02.631
THE BAG BAN.

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:03.732
WHEN FEE WHICH IS A SOURCE

01:20:03.798 --> 01:20:05.967
REDUCTION MEASURE MICROBEADS AND

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:07.769
PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WERE

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:09.738
BANNED AGAIN ANOTHER PREVENTION

01:20:09.804 --> 01:20:10.839
APPROACH?

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:13.008
THE STRAWS UPON REQUEST IS A

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:14.876
PREVENTION APPROACH IT REDUCES

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:18.580
CONSUMPTION AND SENATOR ALLEN'S --

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.715
FOOD WHERE LEGISLATION THAT

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.684
REALLY ELIMINATES FOAM FOOD

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:23.685
WHERE --

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.720
WHICH GETS US --

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:28.823
TO ANOTHER ELIMINATION APPROACH --

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:29.391
BUT WE STILL NEED TO ADDRESS

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:33.261
THESE THE CIGARETTE FILTERS --

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:35.330
FOOD AND BEVERAGES LIKE THE

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.332
WRAPS CONTAINERS CUPS PLATES

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:38.867
UTENSILS AND BOTTLES.

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:41.803
CAPS IN LEADS AND MICRO FIBERS.

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.872
AND I WILL SAY THAT WE CAN LOOK

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:46.074
TO LOCAL POLICY IN CALIFORNIA

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:47.409
SOMETIMES OUR LOCAL.

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:49.411
GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:50.712
HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN THE

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:52.514
THINKING ON THIS --

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:54.883
FOR EXAMPLE THE PLASTIC BAG BAN

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:56.918
ON THE FIRST ONE WAS IN TWO

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:57.919
THOUSAND AND SEVEN IN THE CITY

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.554
OF SAN FRANCISCO.

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:01.056
THE FIRST POLY STYRENE ORDINANCE

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:02.457
WAS INTRODUCED BY SENATOR

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.826
SKINNER IN THE CITY OF BERKLEY

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:07.329
WAY BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:08.330
EIGHT OKAY THANK YOU.

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:10.966

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.300
AND UTENSIL --

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:14.603
BANS BANS ON PLASTIC HAVE COME

01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:16.638
FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL TWO ITEMS

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:19.407
THAT REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN --

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:21.643
WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.012
STATE LEGISLATION YET OR FIGURE

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:24.813
ARE -- SAN

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.715
LUIS OBISPO AND CITY OF SAN

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:28.183
FRANCISCO BANNED THE SALE OF

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.718
PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES IN

01:21:29.784 --> 01:21:31.486
GOVERNMENT FACILITIES.

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:32.821
AND BOTH SAN FRANCISCO AND

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:35.123
OAKLAND HAVE ALSO ATTACH FEES TO

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:38.994
CERTAIN --

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.696
TO LITTER ON LITTERING NO FOR

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:44.766
THE CLEAN UP APPROACH BUT

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:46.234
PERHAPS THE MOST --

01:21:46.301 --> 01:21:48.236
GROUNDBREAKING RECENT

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:50.338
LEGISLATION FROM --

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.207
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS BERKELEY'S

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.041
ORDINANCE --

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:55.577
WHICH I HOPE TO CRAFT --

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:58.246
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH IS

01:21:58.313 --> 01:21:59.147
REALLY.

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:00.649
REALLY GETTING OUT THE SOURCE

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:02.884
REDUCTION APPROACH IT'S IS NO

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:04.886
DISPOSABLES WILL BE USED FOR ON

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:07.289

PLATES AND UTENSILS.

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:15.330
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:17.332
EUROPE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE IT SO

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:19.167
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT I MEAN THEY

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:20.568
ACTUALLY HAVE MAKE CAFES WHERE

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.170
THERE ARE REUSABLE CUPS AND YOU

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:23.738

DISPOSABLE CUPS EMULATING THE

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:35.350
BAG CHARGE SAYING THAT PEOPLE

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:36.584
CAN BRING THEIR OWN.

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:38.053
THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:41.022
WANNA GET REUSABLE AS INTO FOOD

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:43.091
WHERE BUT B. Y. O. IS.

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:44.959
NOT A GOOD APPROACH SO THEY HOW

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:47.829
ARE FUNDING --

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:50.432
HAVE FUNDING FOR THE REAR YOU TO

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:52.701

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:55.070
MEAL IN A REUSABLE PACKAGE THAT

IS PROVIDED BY THE BY THE

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.008
BUSINESS ITSELF.

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:01.943
IT BANS A SOME OF THE WORST

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:03.778
CHEMICALS IN FOOD WHERE

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:05.647
FLUORINATED SUBSTANCES AND IT

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:06.981
ALSO -- SAYS

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:08.717
THAT ALL DISPOSABLES MUST BE

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:10.518
COMPOSTABLE IN BERKELEY BUT

01:23:10.585 --> 01:23:12.687
ACTUALLY COMPOSTABLE NOT JUST

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:14.656
CERTIFIED BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:16.591
BREAK DOWN IN BERKELEY'S COMPOST

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:18.560
FACILITY.

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:20.495
ON THIS IS A REALLY GOOD A MODEL

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:23.164
AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE I THINK

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:25.800
MORE AMBULATION OF THIS IN LOCAL

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:29.003
GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA --

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:33.942
UPSTREAM CONVENE TO A IN

01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:37.412
DECEMBER A WORKSHOP FOR BAY AREA

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:39.047
ZERO WASTE AND STORM WATER

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:41.416
PROGRAM OPERATORS AND THE

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:43.651
CONCLUSION OF THAT WORKSHOP.

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:46.888
THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT --

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:48.790
STAFF SAID TO US --

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.925
WE THINK THAT REALLY IS THAT

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:53.061
WHAT WE NEED IS TO HAVE MORE

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:55.029
POLICIES THAT FOCUS ON REDUCING

01:23:55.096 --> 01:23:56.364
DISPOSABLES.

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:57.399
AND WE ALSO NEED THE

01:23:57.465 --> 01:24:00.034
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RE USE A SO

01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:01.870
THEY ARE PRIORITIZING AND

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:03.738
WORKING WITH US ON TRYING TO

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:06.307
DEVELOP A REGIONAL REUSABLE CUP

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.343
AND CONTAINER PROGRAM IN THE BAY

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:09.544
AREA.

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:14.149
SO THAT INSTEAD OF US CONSUMER A

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:15.884
WHOLE BACKPACK FULL OF REUSABLE

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.385
PRODUCTS THAT THEY WILL BE

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:19.854
AVAILABLE ON DEPOSIT WHEN YOU GO

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:20.922
TO TAKE OUT.

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:23.358
YOUR COFFEE OR TAKE OUT A MEAL --

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:24.492
SO I THINK THESE ARE THE KINDS

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:26.294
OF INNOVATIVE APPROACHES THAT WE

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:28.430
NEED AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:30.298
IT CAN BE EXTREMELY GOOD FOR

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:33.435
BUSINESS I AM THE HI I WHEN I

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:34.636
WAS A EXECUTIVES.

01:24:34.702 --> 01:24:35.937
THE DIRECTOR OF CLEAN WATER

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:38.239
ACTION CALIFORNIA I CREATED THE

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:40.008
RETHINK DISPOSABLE PROGRAM.

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.543
THAT DEBORAH WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:44.512
IN ALAMEDA AND THAT PROGRAMS

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:45.980
WORK TO A THREE HUNDRED

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.615
BUSINESSES SO FAR --

01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:50.251
ON VOLUNTARILY REDUCING SINGLE

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:52.987
USE AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:54.422
100% OF THE PARTICIPANTS HAS

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:55.723
SAVE MONEY.

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:57.358
BY DOING THINGS LIKE --

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.760
THE UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO DID

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.795
IN THEIR CAFE REPLACING

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:02.997
DISPOSABLES WITH REUSABLE IS AND

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:05.266
JUST REDUCING SINGLE USE AND

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:06.668
I'LL JUST SAY IT CAN HAVE

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:09.704
ENORMOUS FINANCIAL BENEFITS THAT --

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:12.774
CAFETERIA IS SAVING NOW A

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:14.375
HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:16.511
DOLLARS A YEAR AFTER THEIR

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:17.812
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AND

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:21.649
SET UP COSTS ARE ACCOUNTED. FOR

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:22.217
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:25.553
AWAY POINT SIX MILLION

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:28.122
DISPOSABLE ITEMS REDUCE PER YEAR.

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.258
AND A CARBON REDUCTION OF TEN

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:32.093
METRIC TONS PER YEAR SO THIS

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.028
KIND OF SOLUTION CAN MAKE REALLY

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:35.330
GOOD FINANCIAL CENTS FOR

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:36.231
BUSINESSES.

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:38.566
THANK YOU.

AND AND CERTAINLY OF A HINT OF

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:45.106
OPTIMISM IN A A HEARING THAT

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:45.673
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE A LITTLE

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:46.608
DEPRESSING.

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:47.509
SO LET ME --

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:48.843
OPEN UP THE FLOOR TO QUESTIONS

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:50.178
THOUGHTS.

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.513
COMMENTS FROM THE THE MEMBERS.

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:53.481
WERE A LITTLE --

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:55.583
YAHIA APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:57.652
IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT WHAT WE IS

01:25:57.719 --> 01:26:00.288
PEOPLE OF DONE TO UNDERMINE THE

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:05.560
HEALTH OF OUR SISTER AND BROTHER.

01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:07.529
MEMBERS OF THE PLANET --

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:09.898
BUT AS FAR AS CLEARLY THERE ARE

01:26:09.964 --> 01:26:11.399
THINGS WE CAN DO AND I

01:26:11.466 --> 01:26:13.034
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT.

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:14.202
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF

01:26:14.269 --> 01:26:16.104
BERKELEY FREQUENTLY TAKES THE

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:17.805
LEAD ON THESE THINGS --

01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:20.041
BUT IS OFTEN ISOLATED BECAUSE

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:21.976
IT'S VIEWED AS BEING SOME KIND

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:24.412
OF LEFT THE WHO KNOWS WHAT.

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:26.581
EXPLANATION FOR HOW WE RESOLVE

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:28.416
OUR PROBLEMS I'M WONDERING ARE

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:29.551
THERE ANY STATISTICS TO

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:31.653
DEMONSTRATE NOT JUST THAT IT'S

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:33.087
GOOD FOR THE PLANET.

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:34.322
BUT THAT --

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:36.991
THERE ARE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.426
SOME OF OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:40.461
SIDE OF THE AISLE AND PERHAPS

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:41.429
EVEN IN OUR OWN.

01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:44.399
PARTY OF WANNA KNOW WHAT THE

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:46.034
WHAT THE PROFIT.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.869
OR LOSS IS GOING TO BE FOR A

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:50.505
BUSINESS OR FOR COMMUNITY IN

01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:53.207
TERMS OF DOLLARS. FOR IT --

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:56.678
TRYING THESE OTHER TO GET RID OF

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:59.047
PLASTICS TO GET RID OF OF THESE

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.515
KINDS OF MATERIALS THAT ARE

01:27:00.582 --> 01:27:01.883
CREATING THE THE WAY.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.018
THE WASTE IN THE GARBAGE THAT'S

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:06.654
PERMEATING OUR OUR WORLD TODAY.

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.356
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON WELL

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:09.891
I CAN I CAN GIVE YOU SOME

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.726
STATISTICS A BIT OF FEEDBACK

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:13.561
FROM THE RETHINK DISPOSABLE

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:15.863
PROGRAM --

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:17.365
SO WORKING WITH OF TO THE

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:19.801
INDEPENDENT SORT OF MOM AND POP

01:27:19.867 --> 01:27:22.036
FOOD BUSINESS BRICK AND MORTAR.

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:24.205
OF FOOD SERVICE OPERATOR IS

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:27.141
SAVING ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO TEN

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:27.742
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR JUST

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:30.178
THROUGH VOLUNTARILY --

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:33.014
REDUCING SINGLE USE AND THEN --

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.582
I GAVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF AN AN

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:37.251
INSTITUTIONAL CASE STUDY THE

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:39.721
UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO --

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:40.955
YOU KNOW SAVING.

01:27:41.022 --> 01:27:43.024
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:44.726
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO --

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:46.661
I THINK I THINK THE POINT I WANT

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:48.696
TO MAKE IS THAT MOST FOOD THE

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:50.598
FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY DOES NOT

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:52.600
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MONEY

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:53.968
THEY'RE SPENDING ON DISPOSABLES.

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:55.737
OF ERROR IT'S VERY CONVENIENT TO

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:57.639
USE DISPOSABLES AND EVERYONE

01:27:57.705 --> 01:28:00.208
THINKS THAT RE USE SWITCHING

01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:03.011
BACK TO WHAT SOME OF US.

01:28:03.077 --> 01:28:03.478
SOME OF US IN CERTAIN

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:05.179
GENERATIONS REMEMBER AS THE WAY

01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:06.881
WE USED TO GET OUR FOOD SERVED

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:09.517
IN SCHOOL ON REAL PLAYED SOME

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:09.984
REAL.

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:10.985
CUPS -- AND

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:14.422
THE WAY WE USED TO BE SIR DONALD

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.457
CREATED THE THE TO THE TRASH

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:18.760
FILLED ME ALL THAT'S CALLED FAST

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:20.561
FOOD -- THAT --

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:21.929
PEOPLE THINK THAT GOING BACK TO

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:23.698
DISH WASHING AND GOING BACK TO

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:25.600
RE USE IS GOING TO COST A LOT OF

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:26.034
MONEY.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.202
BUT I SET OUT TO INVESTIGATE

01:28:28.269 --> 01:28:29.570
THAT WHEN I SET UP REFILL

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.572
DISPOSABLE AND PROGRAM HAS

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:34.509
PROVEN THAT ACTUALLY GOING BACK

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:35.977
TO RE USE AND BEING.

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.712
MINDFUL ABOUT HOW WE CAN

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.981
MINIMIZE PACKAGING SAVES

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:41.215
BUSINESSES MONEY.

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:42.917
I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:44.485
INFORMATION TO PROVIDE US OF FOR

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:46.788
THOSE WHO.

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:48.322
A NOT NECESSARILY MOVE BY JUST

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:50.725
OUR LACK OF CARING AND

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:51.859
RESPONSIBILITY.

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:54.962
FOR GOD'S OTHER CREATURES --

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:56.531
AND AND FOR OUR OWN HEALTH.

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:58.232
THE THAT EXISTS WITH SOME OF

01:28:58.299 --> 01:29:00.535
THESE MICRO FIBERS AS WELL AS

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:03.805
JUST PLASTICS HAVING A AN OIL

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:06.040
PETROLEUM BASED TO THEM --

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:07.909
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO TO BE

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:09.610
ABLE TO PUT INTO DOLLARS AND

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:12.013
CENTS WHAT THE WHAT THE COST IS

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.248
AND HOW THERE IS A POTENTIALLY A

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:18.152
MUCH GREATER SAVINGS WE USE --

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:20.021
POTENTIALS CAN I JUST ADD ONE

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:21.689
MORE THOUGHT I SAW SENATOR HOLE

01:29:21.756 --> 01:29:25.059
HOLDING UP THE COMPOSTABLE CUP

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:25.359
[inaudible]

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:28.029
YEAH WHEN.

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:30.131
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION I MAY AND I

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:30.732
KNOW THAT THANK YOU.

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:31.833
WHICH IT YOU MENTIONED AND I WAS

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:34.302
WATCHING YOUR PRESENTATION IN

01:29:34.368 --> 01:29:36.237
THE OTHER ROOM THE THE ISSUE OF

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:38.239
RECYCLABLE OR DISPOSABLE BUT NOT

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:40.508
REALLY DISPOSABLE THEY DON'T WHY

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:40.775
THEY DON'T.%

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:42.744
AND A FOLLOW THE THAT THE NORMAL

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:44.245
TRACK FOR THIS IN THIS ONE SAYS

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:47.448
COMBUSTIBLE A COMPOSED OF FULL.

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:48.950
EXAMPLE A BOTTLE YOU GOT A

01:29:49.016 --> 01:29:50.184
PROBLEM IS THAT IS WHAT WOULD

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:52.053
MADE FROM CORN AND IT SURE LOOKS

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.621
LIKE PLASTIC TO ME BUT IS THIS

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:56.991
SOMETHING THAT IS.

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.259
COMBUSTIBLE.

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.660
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION --

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:00.328
FIRST WELL I JUST WANT TO SAY TO

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:02.864
TO PUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.365
ECONOMICS.

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:05.833
THESE ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.269
AND THE RESULT OF OUR PHONE BANS --

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.138
WELL THAT'S GOOD FOR THE MARINE

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:11.973
ENVIRONMENT GETTING FOAM OUT OF

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:13.975
THE ENVIRONMENT IS REALLY GOOD

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.911
FOR THE FOR THE SPEAKER SYSTEM --

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:20.348
IT'S TURN IT IS OR HAVE TO BEAT

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:21.783
MOSTLY OF TO BE RECYCLABLE OR

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:24.152
COMPOSTABLE AND THAT'S ABOUT.

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:26.420
A TEN TIMES THE COST OF WHAT IS

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:29.056
REPLACING SO WE'RE DRIVING UP

01:30:29.123 --> 01:30:30.892
COSTS FOR FOOD BUSINESSES --

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:32.426
THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:34.128
CERTIFIED AS COMPOSTABLE

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:35.863
PLASTICS THAT ARE.

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:37.498
THAT CLAIM TO BE COMPOSTABLE

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:39.133
COURTING A CALIFORNIA LAW HAVE

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:42.170
TO BE HAVE TO HAVE CERTIFICATION --

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:45.206
AND SO THEY MAY BE TECHNICALLY

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.908
COMPOSTABLE IN.

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.943
A LABORATORY SETTING BUT WHAT WE

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:51.045
ARE HEARING FROM THE COM POSTERS

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.180
IS -- AND

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:54.015
I'M TALKING TO THEM IN ALAMEDA

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:56.417
COUNTY AND MARIN COUNTY WE HAD

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:58.085
THE OREGON COMPOST OR IS AS A

01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:00.721
WHOLE GROUP CAME OUT WITH THE

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:01.989
STATEMENT THAT.

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:04.592
A LOT OF THIS BIO PLASTICS STUFF

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:06.761
THAT'S MADE FROM CORN AND OTHER

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:08.429
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WHILE IT

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:09.664
IS PLASTIC.

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.632
IS NOT ACTUALLY DEGRADING IN

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:14.235
MANY COMPOST COMMERCIAL COMPOST

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:16.437
FACILITIES AND SO IT ENDS UP

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:17.505
GETTING IT ENDS UP EITHER

01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:19.607
CONTAMINATING THE GOOD ORGANIC

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:20.675
COMPOST.

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:23.110
OR IT ENDS UP JUST BEING SCREEN

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:25.246
END OR IT ENDS UP BEING SCREENED

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:27.114
OUT AND SENT TO LANDFILL ANYWAY

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:29.183
SO THE PROBLEMATIC PRODUCTS HAVE

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:29.984
BEEN.

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:33.354
ON THE CUP BIO COPS BIO BAGS THE

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:36.557
UTENSILS AND THE BIO PLASTIC

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:38.492
FOOD CONTAINERS --

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:39.560
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT HEY

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:41.128
THAT MANY OF THEM NOT ALL OF

01:31:41.195 --> 01:31:41.996
THEM BUT MANY OF THEM ARE

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:43.231
TELLING US JUST THEY'RE JUST

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:45.399
ACTUALLY NOT TO GRADING IN THE

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:46.868
REAL WORLD SETTING.

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:48.402
SO EITHER HAVE TO BE DESIGNED

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:51.138
BETTER OR WE NEED TO FOCUS MORE

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:54.308
ON WE USE LAST QUESTION IF I MAY.

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:56.978
SO IF -- IF

01:31:57.044 --> 01:32:00.147
WE REALLY WANT A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:32:00.214 --> 01:32:01.582
REALLY WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.117
AND I SUSPECT THAT'S THE REASON

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.952
THAT WE WENT TO THESE DIFFERENT

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.288
KINDS OF OF A CUP SAID

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.891
APPARENTLY ARE NOT ANY BETTER.

01:32:09.957 --> 01:32:12.260
OR IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:14.161
STATE NOT ANY BETTER FOR THE THE

01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:15.396
ENVIRONMENT --

01:32:15.463 --> 01:32:17.632
ARE THERE --

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:21.202
PLACES TO GO WHERE WE CAN.

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:22.837
YOU KNOW MAKE THOSE CONSUMER

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:25.373
BASE DECISIONS BASED UPON ACTUAL

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:26.941
FACTS ABOUT PRODUCTS THAT.

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:29.644
WE CAN REUSE AND AND RECYCLE

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:31.145
THAT ARE GOING TO BE.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.147
ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT WE WANT

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:35.149
THEM TO ACHIEVE DO WE NEED TO DO

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:37.018
SOMETHING LEGISLATIVELY ON THAT

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.786
I MEAN OTHERWISE.

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:39.921
IF I COULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.555
IT TO IT HAS ALL SORTS OF GOOD

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:44.392
STUFF ON IT GREEN STRIPE BY

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.360
EAGLE PRODUCTS AND THERE'S A BIG

01:32:46.427 --> 01:32:47.929
EGO THING ON HERE I MEAN.

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:49.330
I THINK MANY OF US USUALLY ISN'T

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:51.098
THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD SERVICE

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:53.067
BUT WE'RE NOT SO WHAT DO WE DO

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:56.137
TO TRY TO PUT US BACK ON THE

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:58.706
RIGHT PATH.

01:32:58.773 --> 01:32:59.540
GIVE ME TAKE.

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:00.875
WELL.

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:03.110
I MEAN I THINK IF WERE.

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:04.578
IT'S ONE THING TO GET CERTAIN

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:05.513
IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE SOMETHING

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:07.415
THAT WORKS IN A LABORATORY

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:09.183
SETTING BUT AS I SAID WE NEED

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:10.217
PRODUCTS THAT WORK IN A REAL

01:33:10.284 --> 01:33:12.453
WORLD SETTING SO I THINK WE NEED

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.087
TO GO BACK.

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:13.821
WE NEED TO INVOLVE THE CALM

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:17.458
POSTERS IN I AM LOOKING AT THOSE

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:24.498
STANDARDS AND AND THE BUT MY OWN

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:27.635
PERSONAL FEELING FRANKLY IS THAT.

01:33:27.702 --> 01:33:28.703
THE AG THAT.

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:30.738
GROWING CORN AND GROWING

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:32.673
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CAN BE

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:35.109
JUST AS HARMFUL AS EXTRACTING

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:36.177
PETROLEUM.

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:37.979
I MEAN IT REQUIRES A HUGE AMOUNT

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:41.882
OF FERTILIZER ENERGY WATER AND

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:44.085
TRANSITIONING ALL THAT PLASTIC

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.753
TO OUR AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS WILL

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.588
HAVE ENORMOUS CLIMATE IMPACTS

01:33:47.655 --> 01:33:49.890
AND WATER IMPACTS AS WELL.

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:52.426
SO WHILE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT

01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:54.195
FOR US TO DEVELOP COMPOSTABLE

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:55.963
PRODUCTS THAT REALLY COMPOSTING

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.298
CALIFORNIA.

01:33:57.365 --> 01:33:59.800
I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO BE

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:00.868
PLACING.

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:02.937
REALLY FOCUSING EVEN MORE

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:05.740
SERIOUSLY ON TRANSITIONING AWAY

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:07.408
FROM THROW AWAY FOR THROWAWAY

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:08.576
PRODUCTS.

01:34:08.642 --> 01:34:10.711
AND WE NEED POLICIES THAT MAKE

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:12.146
MANDATES.

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:13.981
THAT WE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:16.317
SINGLE USE PACKAGING OVERALL IN

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:18.753
CALIFORNIA BY CERTAIN PERCENT

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:21.088
KIND OF THE WAY WE HAVE ADDRESS

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:21.722
CARBON.

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:23.190
IF I COULD.

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:24.425
BUILT ON AN ANSWER JUST BRIEFLY

01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:26.794
THE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:28.662
TIED TYING THOSE POTENTIALLY

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:30.064
BACK TO MARINE --

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:32.099
WILDLIFE HELP IN TAKING THIS

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.567
CONSIDERATION OF LEANING ON

01:34:33.634 --> 01:34:37.705
AGRICULTURE AS AS A RESOURCE FOR

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:40.141
FOR PRODUCTS LIKE THESE.

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:41.542
I WAS TALKING TO ABOUT MARINE TO

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:43.711
BREEZE IMPACT ON MARINE MAMMALS

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:45.579
HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS ARE VERY

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:46.981
REAL THING THAT HAVE I'M SURE

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:47.581
THIS IS --

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:50.151
AND HE'S COMMITTEES ARE AWARE OF

01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:53.154
FUELING IN THE GROWTH OF THOSE

01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:54.622
ALLERGY.

01:34:54.688 --> 01:34:56.590
IS AFFLUENT FROM AGRICULTURE IS

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:58.592
WARMING WATERS SO THE SO

01:34:58.659 --> 01:35:00.494
SHIFTING.

01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:02.063
FROM ONE PROBLEM TO SEE A

01:35:02.129 --> 01:35:04.231
SEEMING SOLUTION FROM WHERE I

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:06.600
SIT AS I LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON

01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:08.169
WILDLIFE COULD JUST BE.

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:09.503
ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL OR

01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:11.572
OFFSETTING ONE TO TO THE

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:16.310
DETRIMENT OF THE OTHER.

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:17.578
YES THOUGH I MEAN I GUESS THE

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:19.013
WELL THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ALL

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.247
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:23.117
PRODUCTS ARE TRULY COMBUSTIBLE.

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:25.519
SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A MATTER OF

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:26.887
AND I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:29.356
THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE WASTE.

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:32.159
I AND REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:35.396
SINGLE USE BUT I DID THIS IS

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:36.931
THIS IT THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING.

01:35:36.997 --> 01:35:38.532
IF IF WE IF WE ACTUALLY I I I I

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:39.700
GUESS I'LL ALL TO STICK ON YOUR

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.368
COMMENT ABOUT ABOUT HOW WE NEED

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:42.770
TO MAKE YOU'RE RIGHT WE NEED TO

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:44.705
MAKE SURE THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT --

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:46.841
LAB TESTING BUT THE REAL TESTING

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:47.942
OF PRODUCTS THERE ARE SOME

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.443
PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT ARE

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:51.779
TRULY COMPOSTABLE AND AND AND TO

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:53.047
THE EXTENT THAT FOLKS ARE STILL

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:54.682
GONNA RELY ON SINGLE USE WHICH I

01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:55.983
AGREE WE OUGHT TO START TO SHIFT

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:57.685
BEHAVIOR EARLY --

01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:58.686
WE OUGHT TO BE DOING MORE AND

01:35:58.752 --> 01:36:00.521
MORE AS AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:01.188
SHIFT FOCUS ON THE PRODUCTS THAT

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:02.389
ARE.

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:03.657
THAT ARE TRULY IMPOSSIBLE YEAH I

01:36:03.724 --> 01:36:06.093
MEAN LIKE THE FIBER WHERE IS IS

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.495
COMPOSTABLE IT'S TRULY

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:09.296
COMPOSTABLE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:11.765
THAT IT ISN'T LINED WITH PERFORM

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:13.701
NATIVE CHEMICALS AS A LOT OF IT

01:36:13.767 --> 01:36:14.802
HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE YOU KNOW

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:15.903
THE SHINY.

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:18.005
RESIN COATING SHOULDN'T HAVE P.

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:21.008
FASTEN IT BUT I MEAN THAT STUFF

01:36:21.075 --> 01:36:24.278
IS TRULY COMPOST OF BURRS.

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:25.946
YEAH BUT I I THINK YEAH THESE

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:27.381
PRODUCTS I MEAN THERE THERE

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:28.048
THERE'S THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:28.883
THEY ARE.

01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:31.152
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT AS GOOD

01:36:31.218 --> 01:36:33.020
AS USING A REUSABLE --

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:35.890
BUT THEY'RE ALSO BETTER THAN --

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:37.191
THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE THE

01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:38.559
THE MOST PEOPLE USE THOUGH

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.694
CLEARLY ON IN THE CASE OF THIS

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:42.496
PARTICULAR COMPANY --

01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:44.098
TO WE WE NEED TO DO BETTER I'M I

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:47.234
I WILL SAY I KNOW THAT IT'S YEAH

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:48.736
WE ACTUALLY HAVE THESE HAVE MY

01:36:48.802 --> 01:36:51.906
WEDDING AND THEY MELTED IN THE

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:55.176
SIDE SO THEY THEY SO THEY ARE

01:36:55.242 --> 01:36:56.410
CORN I SUPPOSE.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:58.512
OKAY -- ADD

01:36:58.579 --> 01:37:00.047
CENTER SKINNER.

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:00.447
AND THANK YOU --

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:02.983
THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS.

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:05.452
INFORMATIONAL HEARING BECAUSE

01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:07.655
IT'S JUST RORY.

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:11.292
VALUABLE FOR US TO STEP BACK AND

01:37:11.358 --> 01:37:13.494
THINK ABOUT THE ENORMITY OF THE

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:14.895
ISSUE AND I DON'T MEAN TO SAY

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:18.232
THAT. TO MAKE US JUST WANT TO

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:20.534
BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND BUT

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:22.803
BUT TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:24.738
THE VARIOUS --

01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:26.740
EFFORTS WE'VE MADE OVER TIME IN

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:29.710
CALIFORNIA BACK IN NINETEEN

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:31.645
EIGHTY NINE PASSED AB NINE

01:37:31.712 --> 01:37:33.347
THIRTY NINE WHICH WHERE WE WERE

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:35.282
ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO SET A

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:36.450
50%.

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:38.586
RECYCLING GOAL AND WHILE THAT'S

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:40.621
BEEN TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE LESS

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:41.455
TODAY.

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:43.891
WE WE DID THAT BECAUSE WE WERE

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:46.160
THEN IN A LANDFILL CRISIS AND WE

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:48.128
SAW THAT THE AMOUNT OF WASTE PER

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:50.264
PERSON WAS GROWING AND WE FELT

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:51.932
LIKE OKAY WE REALLY NEED TO DEAL

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:52.700
WITH THIS.

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:55.069
AND WE SHOULD BE PROMOTING%

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:57.271
RECYCLING FOR LOTS OF ENERGY

01:37:57.338 --> 01:38:00.207
EFFICIENCY MEANS AND WE PROBABLY

01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:01.675
WEREN'T THINKING AS MUCH AROUND.

01:38:01.742 --> 01:38:03.677
OUR CARBONAND GREENHOUSE GASES

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:05.646
BUT WE WERE THINKING A LITTLE

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:08.082
BIT ABOUT MARINE WAY STE.

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:08.649
BUT NOW WE COME TO THE POINT

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:09.483
WHERE.

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:10.851
WELL FIRST OFF WE'VE GOTTEN SO

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:14.955
ON ONE THERE'S A COMPLETE MYTH

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:16.357
THAT IF SOMETHING'S PICKED UP

01:38:16.423 --> 01:38:17.791
WHERE YOU PUT IT IN A RECYCLING

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.126
BIN THAT MEANS IT'S RECYCLED

01:38:19.193 --> 01:38:20.427
THAT'S A COMPLETE MESS.

01:38:20.494 --> 01:38:21.629
IT'S NOT.

01:38:21.695 --> 01:38:23.564
THAT'S COLLECTION.

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:25.466
SO TO BE. TO ACTUALLY BE

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:27.735
RECYCLED IT HAS TO BE REMADE

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.270
INTO A NOTHER PRODUCT.

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:31.438
AND WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW IS VERY

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:32.806
LITTLE OF THAT WHICH WE ARE

01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:33.907
COLLECTING IS BEING MADE INTO

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:36.977
WHAT ANOTHER PRODUCT PARTLY DUE.

01:38:37.044 --> 01:38:40.014
TO WE HAVE MUCH LESS --

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.316
MANUFACTURING IN UNITED STATES

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:44.451
OR CALIFORNIA THAT USES ANY OF

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:45.886
THIS MATERIAL IN REMANUFACTURE

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.254
SO THERE ARE STILL SOME BUT MUCH

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:48.355
LESS.

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:51.058
AND WE SEND IT ALL.

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:52.826
TO CHINA AND ELSEWHERE WHO NO

01:38:52.893 --> 01:38:55.095
LONGER WANTS OUR MATERIALS SO A

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:56.463
LOT OF THE FOCUS WHEN WE READ

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:58.365
OUR BACKGROUND MATERIALS IT

01:38:58.432 --> 01:39:00.167
TALKS ABOUT.

01:39:00.234 --> 01:39:02.503
WE ARE WHAT'S CALLED WHAT'S WORD

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.405
WHERE THEY CAUGHT.

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:05.039
NATIONAL SORTS SORRY SORRY SORRY

01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:10.678
SO IN THIS FOCUS ON CONTAMINATED --

01:39:10.744 --> 01:39:12.079
BUNDLES MEANING --

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:14.748
THE WHEN THE PROCESSING FACILITY --

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:15.983
PREPARES --

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:18.719
THE THE BAIL TO SELL OR TO SEND

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.487
TO CHINA IT NOW CHINA'S LOOKING

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:23.023
MORE CLOSELY AND WHETHER OUR

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:25.292
MATERIAL IS CONTAMINATED.

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:26.860
BUT REALLY BOTTOM LINE IS.

01:39:26.927 --> 01:39:28.195
AS OTHER COUNTRIES BEGIN TO

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:29.963
PRODUCE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE PER

01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:31.665
PERSON THAT WE DO THEY DON'T

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:33.267
WONDER DRUG THEY DON'T NEED IT

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:34.401
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN.

01:39:34.468 --> 01:39:35.903
AND SO IF WHATEVER

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:37.771
INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE FOR

01:39:37.838 --> 01:39:39.640
REMANUFACTURING THEY'RE GOING TO

01:39:39.707 --> 01:39:40.708
USE THEIR OWN.

01:39:40.774 --> 01:39:42.710
TRASH NOT OURS.

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:43.911
THEY DON'T WANT OURS SO WHAT ARE

01:39:43.977 --> 01:39:46.613
WE GOING TO DO WITH OUR IT COMES

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.449
BACK TO IS.

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:50.250
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO

01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:52.219
PROTECT OUR OCEANS.

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:55.055
AND YOUR THE FACT THAT.

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:56.623
THERE'S IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:59.093
ADEQUATELY REMANUFACTURE.

01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:00.861
ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT WE USE

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:01.528
NOW.

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:02.763
IS TO DROP ARE SINGLE USE

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:04.098
PRODUCTS.

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:06.233
AND THEN WITHIN THAT SINGLE USE

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.936
WHATEVER STILL HAS TO REMAIN. TO

01:40:09.002 --> 01:40:11.105
HAVE IT EITHER COMPOSED BOTH

01:40:11.171 --> 01:40:12.439
BECAUSE THAT IS BETTER I MEAN IT

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:14.041
IS.

01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:16.844
OR OR FAR LESS BALL YOU LIKE HOW

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.379
CAN IT IT'S LIKE NOW.

01:40:18.445 --> 01:40:20.914
WE KNOW THAT CARS FOR EXAMPLE.

01:40:20.981 --> 01:40:23.217
WAY FAR LESS AND THEY WAY FAR

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:24.718
LESS BECAUSE THE MATERIALS WE

01:40:24.785 --> 01:40:27.454
USE FOR THEM IT'S LESS MATERIAL.

01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:30.424
FOR THE SAME PURPOSE SO WHATEVER

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:31.959
SINGLE USE WE'RE GONNA USE HAS

01:40:32.025 --> 01:40:33.827
TO BE LESS MATERIAL AND THEN BUT

01:40:33.894 --> 01:40:36.997
WE JUST HAVE TO USE WAY LESS

01:40:37.064 --> 01:40:37.698
SINGLE USE [inaudible]

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:41.335
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET TO YOUR

01:41:00.587 --> 01:41:01.922

INTERNATIONAL XP AS AN EXCHANGE

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:54.928
IN THAT AREA.

01:43:54.995 --> 01:43:57.064
IS CERTAIN THE OFF OFFICE OF THE

01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:58.532
ESSENCE SO --

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:00.767

THE IN IN THIS FIELD --

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:19.753

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.587
QUITE THE SAME IN ALL AT JUSTICE

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:22.556

TO THE NATURE RIGHT IT'S IT'S

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:28.261
LIKE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S IT'S POD

01:44:28.328 --> 01:44:29.796
VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:31.565
NATIONAL IDENTITY SO WE GIVE RUN

01:44:31.632 --> 01:44:34.968

BY HAS BE HAVE BEEN.

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:58.191
VERY MUCH INTERNALIZED BY THE

01:44:58.258 --> 01:45:00.360
POPULATION BY THE POLITICIANS

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:01.728
BUT ALSO BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:04.564
BY BUSINESSES AND THIS IS.

01:45:04.631 --> 01:45:06.366
WHAT I THINK --

01:45:06.433 --> 01:45:09.069
MAIDS ARE STILL ONE OF THE

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.570
LEADING COUNTRIES.

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:12.005
IN EUROPE IF NOT IN THE VOTE IN

01:45:12.072 --> 01:45:13.073

THAT BEING SAID I HAVE TO SAY WE

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.552

SACRAMENTO I READ.

01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:32.959
A RECENT REPORT BY MINISTRY OF

01:45:33.026 --> 01:45:34.661
THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH WAS QUITE

01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:36.363
SELF CRITICAL RIGHT I MEAN THERE

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:37.230
COULD YOU AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:45:37.297 --> 01:45:39.199
WAY AMBITIOUS GOALS SET BY THE

01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:41.001
EUROPEAN UNION ACTUALLY UNTIL

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:42.569
NEXT YEAR.

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:43.537
TWENTY TWENTY AT THE OUT IN THIS

01:45:43.603 --> 01:45:45.305
REPORT INTERIM REPORT THAT KIND

01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:47.174
OF GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS THE

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.975
GOOD NEWS FOR INSTANCE IS --

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:51.378
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN AUSTRIA HAS

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:53.213
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY RAY

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.948
POSITIVE RIGHT --

01:45:55.015 --> 01:46:01.655
AT THE SAME TIME --

01:46:01.722 --> 01:46:02.289
THE EMBASSY BECAUSE THE ENERGY

01:46:02.355 --> 01:46:04.758
CONSUMPTION THIS IS PROBABLY BAD

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.760
RIGHT.

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:08.061
THEN -- IT'S

01:46:08.128 --> 01:46:09.863
POSITIVE AT THAT THE ENERGY

01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:11.631
MAKES IN AUSTRIA IS IS QUITE

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:13.767
GOOD SO WE HAVE.

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:14.601
APPROXIMATELY --

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:18.171
THIRTY FIFTH 53% CURRENTLY AT

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:21.708
RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE OF A

01:46:21.775 --> 01:46:25.212
ROLL OF OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION.

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:28.849
AND ELECTRICITY 60% OF BY HIGH

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:30.684
TO APOLLO RIGHT SO THIS IS GOOD

01:46:30.751 --> 01:46:31.384
MMHM.

01:46:31.451 --> 01:46:34.321
OUT BAD GREENHOUSE GASES HAVE

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:35.722
BEEN GOING UP.

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:36.323
IN AUSTRIA AS WELL AND THAT'S

01:46:36.389 --> 01:46:37.991
ALSO BECAUSE OF HEAVY TRAFFIC SO

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:39.760
AUSTRIAN ALWAYS REALLY AT THE

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:41.261
CENTER OF EUROPE SO WE HAVE.

01:46:41.328 --> 01:46:43.830
NO SALAS WEST EAST RIGHT SO --

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:45.332
SO THERE ARE MANY FACTORS WE WE

01:46:45.398 --> 01:46:48.168
CAN'T REALLY IMPLANTS ALSO RIGHT

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:48.769
SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY HUMBLE

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:49.770
RIGHT --

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:51.538
THERE'S NO REASON TO BRAG ABOUT

01:46:51.605 --> 01:46:52.873
THE ANYTHING.

01:46:52.939 --> 01:46:55.175
ABOUT THE DEBT BEING SAD --

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:59.980
I I BELIEVE THAT AUSTRIA IS IN

01:47:00.046 --> 01:47:01.481
COUNTIES ARE REALLY INTERESTING

01:47:01.548 --> 01:47:03.750
PATTON IS TO WORK WITH AND IF

01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:05.352
YOU ALLOW YOU MENTIONED THE CITY

01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:06.286

I'M A STILL I WILL FOCUS ON ON

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:12.025
ON ON ON THE END THAT THIS SEEMS

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:13.794
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ALL BECAUSE

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.428
BECAUSE YOU I'M I'M IN THE STATE

01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:15.996
SENATE.

01:47:16.062 --> 01:47:17.998
AB PADS ON THE ONE HAND I

01:47:18.064 --> 01:47:19.132
BELIEVE DEBT.

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:21.434
AB ALL THE CHALLENGES IN THIS

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:22.736
AREA WE HAVE WE HAVE TO TACKLE

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.704

RIGHTS WE AGREE ON THAT.

01:47:26.706 --> 01:47:27.707
AND THEN A GIVEN YOU KNOW THE

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:31.011
DENSELY POPULATED REAS IN --

01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:32.712
IN THE IN THE IN THE WEST OFF OF

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:34.781
CALIFORNIA RIGHT IT'S IF IF THE

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:35.882
ESEE THESE ARE NOT RIGHT BUT

A SOVIET MAYES IS IS QUITE AN

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:55.569
INTERESTING EXAMPLE BECAUSE OF

DIMENSION.

01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:19.893
IN THE LAST DECADE --

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.995
UP AS A MODEL OF URBAN

01:48:22.062 --> 01:48:24.631
DEVELOPMENT.

01:48:24.698 --> 01:48:27.801
ABBAS SO.

IT'S THE FIRM FOR ITS ITS ON THE

01:48:51.391 --> 01:48:54.060
MAJOR RIGHT NOW.

LOS DISCORD TO MY PRESENTATION

01:48:56.196 --> 01:48:59.833
RIGHT THAT'S GAINES NOT.

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:02.535
ARRIVE VIA THE SO.

01:49:02.602 --> 01:49:03.737
SO IT HAS REACHED IS THE IF THE

01:49:03.803 --> 01:49:04.604
LOT OF INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION

01:49:04.671 --> 01:49:06.206
BECAUSE IT LEADS MANY RANKINGS

01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:08.208
FOR INSTANCE IN THE AREA OF LIVE

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:09.175
ABILITIES WITH ECONOMIST.

01:49:09.242 --> 01:49:12.212
HAS RANKED THE ON THE FIRST --

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:15.248
IN THE MELISSA --

01:49:15.315 --> 01:49:17.617
A AND ALSO BY THE UNITED NATIONS

01:49:17.684 --> 01:49:18.818
IT SETS WERE AND AT THE HAVE

01:49:18.885 --> 01:49:20.587
ACTUALLY BEEN MANY STUDIES MADE

01:49:20.654 --> 01:49:22.489
ON THESE STUDIES YOU KNOW WHY IS

01:49:22.555 --> 01:49:23.556
IT THAT THE CITY LIKE ME AND

01:49:23.623 --> 01:49:24.324
THAT IS --

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:27.027
SO SUCCESSFUL IN LEADING AND THE

01:49:27.093 --> 01:49:29.095
INTERESTING THING IS --

01:49:29.162 --> 01:49:31.431
IF IT IS A LOT POOREST ON NOT

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:33.099
ALL RIGHTS ALSO V. N. AS QUITE

01:49:33.166 --> 01:49:34.634
IN THE LONG TRADITION OF SOCIAL

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:36.002
POLICIES ITS ADDRESS.

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:40.240
BUT A LOT OF DEAD BOYS DOWN --

01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:41.841
TO AT THE CUTTING EDGE.

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:43.810
INVASIVE FIFTY K. THE POLICIES

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:46.046
AND AND TECHNOLOGIES AND IF

01:49:46.112 --> 01:49:47.881
YOU'LL LOOK EVEN DEEPER YOU KNOW

01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:49.082
IT'S A LOT ABOUT SCREEN

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:50.517
TECHNOLOGIES AT THE END OF THE

01:49:50.583 --> 01:49:52.852
DAY RIGHT SO A LOT OF THESE

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:53.353
TECHNOLOGIES.

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.322
I NOT ONLY GOOD FOR THE QUALITY

01:49:55.388 --> 01:49:57.123
OF LIVING BUT THEY ALSO ALSO

01:49:57.190 --> 01:49:58.558
COULD FIND VIOLENCE RIGHT THAT

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:00.360
THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:06.766
THAT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING

UP ABOUT TO BE ON THE IS.

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:20.747
THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATION IS

WORKING WITH UNIVERSITIES

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:23.450
RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS ALSO THE

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:24.317
PRIVATE SECTOR PEAK

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:26.219
INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS TO

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:28.421
CHAS IT'S A CHEST AND OF THE

SIGN IN.

01:50:29.356 --> 01:50:30.890
AND OUT TO WORK OUT WHAT COULD

COULD WE MAKE OUR CD SUSTAINABLE

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:35.795
AND AND LIVABLE AT THIS AT THE

01:50:35.862 --> 01:50:37.364
SAME TIME AND THIS IS SOMETHING

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:39.265
THIS GRANT OF REALISTIC APPROACH

01:50:39.332 --> 01:50:40.934
IS IS IS VERY.

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:43.069
THIS SET UP A WHOLE NEW FIFTY

01:50:43.136 --> 01:50:44.504
DISTRICTS AND YOU KNOW BURKE ON

01:50:44.571 --> 01:50:50.977
DECADES JUST TO YOU KNOW. TO TO

01:50:51.044 --> 01:50:53.847
TO FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS DID

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:55.548
WHAT'S AT THE CD TOGETHER WITH

01:50:55.615 --> 01:50:57.417
PABNA SO IT'S UNIVERSITIES

01:50:57.484 --> 01:50:58.818
COMPANIES IT'S IT'S WHAT.

01:50:58.885 --> 01:51:00.253
IT IS DOING --

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.155
TO TO CHIEF THESE THESE KIND OF

01:51:02.222 --> 01:51:04.958
CALLS TO MAKE OUR CITIES OUT

01:51:05.025 --> 01:51:06.393
MORE SUSTAINABLE NOW I CAN'T

01:51:06.459 --> 01:51:10.430
READ MY OWN HANDWRITING BUT

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:11.865
GENERAL CHAT LAST YET FOCUSING

01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:12.732
ON WASTE IN PARTICULAR SELECT

01:51:12.799 --> 01:51:14.034
THE RIGHT THE WASTE MANAGEMENT

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:15.001
ISSUES AND WELL --

01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:16.403
THEWASTE MANAGEMENT IT'S

01:51:16.469 --> 01:51:18.538
INTERESTING --

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:21.274
AT DAD'S ARM AB AB WASTE TO

ENERGY IS IT IS IT IS IT IS IT

01:51:23.276 --> 01:51:24.644
IS A GREAT ISSUE INDIANA RIGHT

01:51:24.711 --> 01:51:27.113
SO APPROXIMATELY IN AUSTIN 50%.

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:30.483
OFF THE WASTE IS RECYCLED --

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:32.218
ENDS SO THEY HAVE PRACTICALLY NO

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:35.488
FEAR THAT LANDFILLS ANYMORE AND

01:51:35.555 --> 01:51:38.058
50% OF THE IN THE IN THE ATTIC

OF GOES INTO A GOES INTO --

01:51:39.459 --> 01:51:41.194
IT WASTE INCINERATION PLANTS.

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:42.929
AT THESE WASTE INCINERATION

01:51:42.996 --> 01:51:44.864
PLANTS IN THE END THE HOUSE SO

01:51:44.931 --> 01:51:46.533
CUTTING EDGE THE IDEA OF

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.168
BASICALLY A VERY EXPENSIVE BUT

01:51:48.234 --> 01:51:49.202
THE REALLY CUTTING EDGE YOU HAVE

01:51:49.269 --> 01:51:50.103
NO VIRTUALLY NO POLLUTION SO I

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:51.337
WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL RIGHT

01:51:51.404 --> 01:51:52.238
YOU KNOW.

01:51:52.305 --> 01:52:01.848
ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE WAIST.

01:52:01.915 --> 01:52:05.718
I INTO AND OF I TRANSFERRED INTO

01:52:05.785 --> 01:52:07.887
AN ITCHY AND 40% OF ALL

01:52:07.954 --> 01:52:10.723
HOUSEHOLDS IT MORE THAN 40% OF

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:12.225
ALL FALL WAS ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:12.959
VIENNA.

01:52:13.026 --> 01:52:17.730
OUR OF AYE AYE AYE SUPPLIED FROM

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:20.200
THESE OF DISTRICT HEATING OF OF

01:52:20.266 --> 01:52:21.868
OF FROM THESE DISTRICT HEATING

01:52:21.935 --> 01:52:24.170
SYSTEMS WITHOUT HAWKS WARDA.

01:52:24.237 --> 01:52:25.839
AND THE AND AND HEATING AND AS

01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:27.540
WELL AS AIR CONDITIONING SO THIS

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:29.609
IS KIND OF A VERY INTERESTING

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:37.584
SYSTEM SO --

01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:40.587
SO IT'S TEN THROUGH --

01:52:40.653 --> 01:52:42.021
IS THERE A GRANT CAPTURE.

OF ORGANIC MATERIAL THAT YOU'RE.

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:49.996
TURNING INTO LSG.

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:50.797
WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S A VERY

01:52:50.864 --> 01:52:51.731
SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM BECAUSE

01:52:51.798 --> 01:52:52.499
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO

01:52:52.565 --> 01:52:53.133
FOCUS AND I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:55.435
THAT BUT ONLY FOCUS ON ON ON ON

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:57.103
ON THE ON THE ON THE ON THE

01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:58.505
WASTE MANAGEMENT RIGHT BECAUSE

01:52:58.571 --> 01:53:01.241
IT'S A VERY HOLISTIC SYSTEM.

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:03.776
LIKE WHERE OF FOR INSTANCE THE

01:53:03.843 --> 01:53:06.179
IN THE IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM THE

01:53:06.246 --> 01:53:08.014
ENERGY PRODUCED IN THE BREAKING

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:09.382
PROCESS.

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:14.387
OFF THE OFF THE OFF THE YEAH IS

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:16.823
FED INTO THE ENERGY SYSTEM AGAIN

01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:18.591
AND THEY KIND OF USED TO

01:53:18.658 --> 01:53:20.527
ELECTRICITY. TO TO OPERATE THE

01:53:20.593 --> 01:53:21.895
ESCALATE THIS ALLEYWAY THIS

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:24.063
ELECTRICITY AND SO ON SO IT IS

01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:25.798
KIND OF BY THE ADAM THAT'S WHAT

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:27.634
I MEANT IT'S IT'S IT'S BASICALLY

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:28.701
A SYSTEM.

01:53:28.768 --> 01:53:30.970
WHICH I WHICH WHICH IS A

01:53:31.037 --> 01:53:33.173
COMPREHENSIVE RIGHT AND WHICH IS

01:53:33.239 --> 01:53:35.074
NOT ONLY LIMITED TO A TWO TO ONE

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:37.177
ASPECT WHICH IS IMPORTANT OF

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:40.079
COURSE TWO WAY STREET.

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:42.382
CRAFT ALL RIGHT.

01:53:42.448 --> 01:53:43.049
COULD NOT VERY I MEAN I KNOW

01:53:43.116 --> 01:53:44.717
YOU'VE TAKEN A COUPLE TRIPS TO

01:53:44.784 --> 01:53:46.085
EUROPE ON ON THESE ON THIS KIND

01:53:46.152 --> 01:53:48.121
OF THIS WASTE MANAGEMENT ISSUE

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:50.523
RIGHT AND IS THERE THERE'S WHAT.

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:51.558
DO YOU WANNA CAN GIVE US A QUICK

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:52.959
EXAMINATION I I PRESUME THAT VNS

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:54.527
USING THAT WE HAVE THE

01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:55.762
TECHNOLOGY. TO TO DO THE CARBON

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:56.763
CAPTURE IN THAT THE THE RAP

01:53:56.829 --> 01:53:57.764
AGAINST INCINERATORS IS THAT AT

01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.065
LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES WE

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:00.967
JUST BURN THE TRASH AND ALL THE

01:54:01.034 --> 01:54:03.536
POLITICAL UP INTO THE AIR RIGHT

01:54:03.603 --> 01:54:03.703
SO.

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:06.072
IT'S IN MY GENERATION WAS THE

01:54:06.139 --> 01:54:07.340
CATTLE ACT AND IT BECAME THE

01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:08.541
LEXUS I GUESS IS THE TESLA

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:12.178
VERSION OF INCINERATION AND IF

01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:13.613
PRISCILLA PRESLEY WERE HERE HE'D

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:15.215

INCINERATOR RIGHT. TO YOU OKAY

01:54:17.684 --> 01:54:18.618
THESE ARE THE THESE VIENNESE

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:21.521
INCINERATORS PROVIDE NECESSARY

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:22.956
ELECTRICITY AND HEATING FOR THE

01:54:23.022 --> 01:54:27.126
CITY BUT THEY HAVE --

01:54:27.193 --> 01:54:29.395
ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS A RIGHT

01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:31.064
NEAR. ZERO ZERO NOW THEY'RE

01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:32.699
EXPENSIVE VERY EXPENSIVE THERE

01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:33.900
IS RIGHT RIGHT --

01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:36.436
BUT IT'S DOES IT BECAUSE IT'S AT

01:54:36.502 --> 01:54:38.338
THE AT THE CITY SANTA YOU KNOW

01:54:38.404 --> 01:54:39.472
THEY EVEN INCINERATION PLANTS.

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:40.540
BATES THOSE TO THE CITY CENTER

01:54:40.607 --> 01:54:44.310
BUT IT'S IT'S NO --

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:48.114
DEAD AND COMING FROM.

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:50.316
A DELEGATIONS FROM HONG KONG AND

01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:51.618
AYE AYES TALKS IN HONG KONG A

01:54:51.684 --> 01:54:52.418
COUPLE OF YEARS BACK AND IS IT

01:54:52.485 --> 01:54:54.587
HOW DID YOU DO THAT YOU KNOW

01:54:54.654 --> 01:54:55.855
BECAUSE WE CABS.

01:54:55.922 --> 01:54:58.191
HOW HOW CAN YOU IN ALL?

01:54:58.258 --> 01:55:00.727
KIND OF OPERATE THEM YEAH IN THE

01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:01.561
SITUATION PLANTED THE CITY OF AT

01:55:01.628 --> 01:55:02.428
THE AT THE BE THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:55:02.495 --> 01:55:04.797
CITY AND AND SO.

01:55:04.864 --> 01:55:06.499
THAT IS IT RIGHT SO --

01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:08.001
YOU HAVE TO HUGE BEST A VAGUE

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:09.235
SPANS OF TECHNOLOGY BUT IT PAYS

01:55:09.302 --> 01:55:10.703
OFF RIGHT IN THE METRICS THAT

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:13.072
<u>OU HAVE THAT WOULD NORMALLY.</u>

01:55:13.139 --> 01:55:14.574
WE DO A POOR JOB OF CALCULATING

01:55:14.641 --> 01:55:16.109
THE EMISSIONS FROM LANDFILLS

01:55:16.175 --> 01:55:17.744
HERE WE JUST SERVICE IT'S A BIG

01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:19.279
CALIFORNIA SECRET WE THINGS THAT

01:55:19.345 --> 01:55:20.980
END UP IN A LANDFILL WE KNOW

01:55:21.047 --> 01:55:21.781
THAT THEY ROCK AND THEY GO

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:22.382
THROUGH.

01:55:22.448 --> 01:55:24.117
THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS

01:55:24.183 --> 01:55:25.418
HE MADE A WE'RE TRYING TO

01:55:25.485 --> 01:55:26.886
CAPTURE THAT BUT WE DON'T REALLY

01:55:26.953 --> 01:55:28.321
SPEND TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:29.155
THAT.

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:30.823
THAT THAT EFFECT ON GREENHOUSE

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:33.726
GAS EMISSIONS IS YOU.

01:55:33.793 --> 01:55:35.461
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THAT.

01:55:35.528 --> 01:55:39.532
OVERALL OUTSIDE OF VIENNA IN

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:43.803
AUSTRIA IS YES VIRTUALLY I MEAN

01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:45.305
THE F. F. BEING FUNDAMENTAL

01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:47.206
REDUCED YOU KNOW OF IN IN THE

01:55:47.273 --> 01:55:48.841
LAST DECADE SO.

01:55:48.908 --> 01:55:51.177
IT'S IT'S IT'S MOSTLY IT'S IT'S

01:55:51.244 --> 01:55:53.746
ALSO SO AND RECYCLING OF WASTE

01:55:53.813 --> 01:55:55.682
AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S IT'S A LOT

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:56.215
WITH BECAUSE IT'S A REYES

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:58.418
COMPREHENSIVES SUBJECT RIGHT.

01:55:58.484 --> 01:56:00.653
SO IT'S UP TO AVOID WASTE THIS

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.188
IS OF COURSE THE FIRST STEP IN

01:56:02.255 --> 01:56:04.157
THIS IS ALSO BE MENTIONED ALSO

01:56:04.223 --> 01:56:06.059
BE MENTIONED IN YOUR DISCUSSION.

01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:08.628
OF A SO TO TO AVOID ONE TIME USE

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:10.697
ITS ADDRESS SO IT'S IT'S ALL OF

01:56:10.763 --> 01:56:13.132
THIS PUBLIC POLICY TO ADVOCATES

01:56:13.199 --> 01:56:15.168
RIGHT INTO A TO A TOOL. TO TO

01:56:15.234 --> 01:56:17.970
PASS LEGISLATION THAT AVOIDS --

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:20.039
OF OF ONE TIME AND ONE TIME USE

01:56:20.106 --> 01:56:21.774
IT SHOULD SET TO A RIGHT AND

01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:22.975
THEN OF COURSE IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:24.977
WITH CYCLING WHICH IS REALLY BIG

01:56:25.044 --> 01:56:26.112
IN AUSTRIA.

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:27.513
AND TELLS A LOT OF FAR OFF TECH

01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:29.582
COMPANIES A GOOD FOCUS ON ON ON

01:56:29.649 --> 01:56:30.717
ON THESE AREAS.

01:56:30.783 --> 01:56:38.991
AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE

01:56:39.058 --> 01:56:41.227
INCINERATION SO IT'S IT'S I BAY

01:56:41.294 --> 01:56:42.061
COMPLEX PROCESS RIGHT CAN YOU

01:56:42.128 --> 01:56:43.029
GIVE US A FLAVOR OF THE TYPE OF

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:44.163
RECYCLING --

01:56:44.230 --> 01:56:44.964
THAT'S HAPPENING AT LEAST AND

01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:46.199
PLASTICS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:47.834
HAVE PLASTIC BOTTLES WHICH ARE

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:48.701
RELATIVELY EASY TO RECYCLE

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:50.636
ALTHOUGH WE DO A LOUSY JOB HERE

01:56:50.703 --> 01:56:52.805
IN CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS WE GOT A

01:56:52.872 --> 01:56:53.373
9%.

01:56:53.439 --> 01:56:55.475
NUMBER THEN THERE'S THESE OTHER

01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:56.943
CONTAINERS I'LL PUT THEM IN.

01:56:57.009 --> 01:56:59.445
DIRTY PLASTIC THERE'S YOGURT AND

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:00.913
MAYONNAISE AND THEY THESE TYPE

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.115
OF THING SO RIGHT THAT COME IN

01:57:02.181 --> 01:57:03.683
THESE CONTAINERS --

01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:06.786
AND RAPPERS --

01:57:06.853 --> 01:57:10.423
HOW DO YOU HOW TO DOING ON THESE

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:12.358
SEGREGATING THE DIFFERENT TYPES

01:57:12.425 --> 01:57:14.427
OF PLASTIC THE FIRST QUESTION

01:57:14.494 --> 01:57:16.696
THE SECOND IS IS --

01:57:16.763 --> 01:57:19.465
LIMITING THE THE CONTAINERS THAT

01:57:19.532 --> 01:57:21.501
THE FREE MARKET IS USING IN THE

01:57:21.567 --> 01:57:23.136
IN THE CITY I KNOW THAT THE U.

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:24.737
E. U. HAS.

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:25.872
A DIRECT THEM THAT THE YOU'RE

01:57:25.938 --> 01:57:27.373
NOT SUPPOSED TO BUT JUST

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.274
HISTORICALLY WHAT IS AUSTRIA

01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:30.076
DEAD WEIGHT WELL --

01:57:30.143 --> 01:57:31.577
FIRST OF ALL --

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:33.813
YOU KNOW AB AS YOU KNOW IS IN

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.481
MANY EAST.

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE A

01:57:36.482 --> 01:57:38.251
SOPHISTICATED WASTE SEPARATION

01:57:38.317 --> 01:57:39.719
SYSTEM RIGHT YOU DON'T HAVE ONLY

01:57:39.786 --> 01:57:44.957
THESE TWO BOXES OLD PAPER ANNA.

BUT YOU HAVE ONE FOR PLASTIC AND

01:57:46.926 --> 01:57:48.628
AND ONE FOR PAPER AND ONE FOR

01:57:48.694 --> 01:57:50.496
GLASS FOR GREEN THEIR SOCIAL FOR

01:57:50.563 --> 01:57:51.464
FOR FOR KILEY.

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:52.899

STEPPED UP OF THESE CONTAINERS

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:03.075
AT A AND AND USUALLY IT'S IT

01:58:03.142 --> 01:58:03.976
MUST ALSO BE THERE'S ALSO IT

01:58:04.043 --> 01:58:05.778
MUST BE INDICATED ON THE PACKAGE.

01:58:05.845 --> 01:58:08.448
OFF THE OF THE MATERIAL IF IT'S

01:58:08.514 --> 01:58:09.816
RECYCLE ALL NOT.

01:58:09.882 --> 01:58:11.384
RIGHT AND AND AND YOU'RE

01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:12.452
COMPLETELY RIGHT DID SOME IN ALL

01:58:12.518 --> 01:58:14.086
OF IT TAKES ALSO SOME EFFORTS TO

01:58:14.153 --> 01:58:15.288
AVOID THAT PEOPLE COLLECT TO

01:58:15.354 --> 01:58:18.758
MATCH RIGHT BECAUSE THE DAY OF

01:58:18.825 --> 01:58:19.992
BUT THEY PUT A LOT OF THINGS

01:58:20.059 --> 01:58:21.594
INTO THE CONTAINER WHICH

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:22.929
SHOULDN'T BE DEBT OR I AM.

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:24.197
OR IN OUR CASE WE'RE PUTTING A

01:58:24.263 --> 01:58:24.831
LOT OF THINGS IN THE CONTAINERS

01:58:24.897 --> 01:58:26.032
THAT.

01:58:26.098 --> 01:58:27.166
WERE TELLING PEOPLE TO PUT THE

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:27.733
CONTAINERS YET RIGHT AND OF

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.802
GETTING RECYCLE RIGHT IT'S

01:58:29.869 --> 01:58:30.770
COMPLICATED FOR MATTER

01:58:30.837 --> 01:58:32.638
CONVENIENCE TO SINGLE STREAM

01:58:32.705 --> 01:58:34.373
MOST OF THE RESIDENTIAL

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.509
RECYCLING SYSTEM IN RIGHT --

01:58:36.576 --> 01:58:37.443
THERE'S BEEN SOME SERIOUS

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:38.211
DOWNSIDE SAID THERE'S SOME

01:58:38.277 --> 01:58:39.946
OUTSIDE THERE'S SOME SERIOUS

01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:41.180
DOWNSIZE BECAUSE SO.

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:43.316
IT IS DISTRESSING HOW LITTLE

01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:44.884
THAT THAT WHICH GETS DURING

01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:46.719
THESE BEEN SENSE OF ACTUALLY

01:58:46.786 --> 01:58:47.353

THIS IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BRING

01:58:54.427 --> 01:58:55.728
UP SOME MORE QUESTIONS FOR

01:58:55.795 --> 01:58:56.829
THINGS WE WANT TO LEARN FROM THE

IN THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY AND

01:59:12.545 --> 01:59:13.379
MUCH MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:59:13.446 --> 01:59:14.847
SUSTAINABLE WAY THEY COULD

01:59:14.914 --> 01:59:15.781
ACTUALLY PRODUCE ENERGY AS WE

01:59:15.848 --> 01:59:16.349

RECYCLER RE KLEBER'S SO I HAVE

01:59:42.808 --> 01:59:44.210

ON THESE ISSUES I HAVE A COUPLE

01:59:49.949 --> 01:59:51.083
OF POINTS TO MAKE IT WAS A

01:59:51.150 --> 01:59:52.518
FASCINATING HEARING I'VE GOT TO

01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:53.719
GO TO A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT SO

01:59:53.786 --> 01:59:55.788
I CAN'T STAY BUT A COUPLE OF

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:57.023
THINGS.

01:59:57.089 --> 01:59:58.324
ONE WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT IS

01:59:58.391 --> 02:00:01.594
RECYCLABLE ISN'T BESIDES THE

02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:03.029
FACT IT ALL GOES INTO ONE FAN.

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:04.063
THE THE DIAGRAM THE RECYCLING

02:00:04.130 --> 02:00:06.632
DIAGRAM NUMBERS AREN'T CORRECT.

02:00:06.699 --> 02:00:08.134
I MEAN THEY OFTEN HAVE ONES ON

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.403
THEM AND THEY AREN'T ONES SO

02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:11.871
LOOKING AT THAT IS REALLY KEY.

02:00:11.938 --> 02:00:13.706
ARE CLOSE LOOP WAS WHAT WE TRY

02:00:13.773 --> 02:00:15.107
TO DO WHICH IS YOU TAKE A BOTTLE

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:18.144
OF PLASTIC ITS USE IT GOES BACK

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:19.679
TO OUR PEOPLE THEY MAKE IT INTO

02:00:19.745 --> 02:00:21.080
A NEW PRODUCT IN THAT IT BECOMES

02:00:21.147 --> 02:00:23.249
A NEW PIECE OF RECYCLED PLASTIC

02:00:23.316 --> 02:00:26.285
OUR P. ET --

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:26.886
AND PART OF OUR PROBLEM IS THE

02:00:26.953 --> 02:00:29.922
CAN LOT OF CRAPPY GOING INTO THE

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:31.657
SAME BàN AND THEN WE HAVE TO

02:00:31.724 --> 02:00:33.893
SORT IT AND OBVIOUSLY FIVE TWO

02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.261
SEVENS GO TO THE TOP BECAUSE

02:00:35.328 --> 02:00:36.495
THERE'S NO OTHER USE --

02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:38.364
FOR THAT I KNOW OF RIGHT NOW

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:42.868
IDEAS -- AND

02:00:42.935 --> 02:00:44.136
THEN THE FACT OF JUST CONTINUING

02:00:44.203 --> 02:00:45.271
LEADING VIRGIN PLASTIC COMMENDED

02:00:45.338 --> 02:00:46.639
STATE IN CONTAINERS IF IT

02:00:46.706 --> 02:00:48.874
DOESN'T RECYCLED IT'S JUST A

02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:49.542
PROBLEM.

02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:51.243
IT ISN'T YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S

02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:52.612
CHEAPER BUT IT'S JUST PROBLEMS

02:00:52.678 --> 02:00:54.113

02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:04.890
I'M CHRISTY GAMER AND THE

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:06.392
DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:07.960
UNIVERSITY COUNCIL ON OCEAN

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:10.196
AFFAIRS SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY COAST.

02:01:10.262 --> 02:01:12.098
I KNOW SOME OF YOU KNOW WHO WE

02:01:12.164 --> 02:01:13.032
ARE FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:14.834
WHO YOU ARE WHO WE ARE WORKING

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.268
TO CHANGE THAT --

02:01:16.335 --> 02:01:17.603
APPRECIATED DOCTOR GORDON'S

02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:18.704
COMMENTS ON SO WHAT SOME

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:20.272
UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING AND I

02:01:20.339 --> 02:01:21.707
WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT EARLIER

02:01:21.774 --> 02:01:23.376
THIS YEAR THE CSU.

02:01:23.442 --> 02:01:25.344
ADOPTED A SINGLE USE PLASTICS

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:27.613
POLICY WHICH WILL PHASE OUT THE

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:30.282
USE OF ALL SINGLE USE STRAWS.

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:31.784
TAKE OUT BAGS AND THE SALE AND

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:35.321
DISTRIBUTION OF PLASTIC WATER

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:36.555
BOTTLES BY.

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:37.390
TWENTY TWENTY THREE NOW I

02:01:37.456 --> 02:01:38.190
PERSONALLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL WISH

02:01:38.257 --> 02:01:39.125
IT WAS ALL FASTER I'M SURE WE

02:01:39.191 --> 02:01:39.425
ALL DAY --

02:01:39.492 --> 02:01:40.693
BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:42.228
THE CSU IS THE LARGEST PUBLIC

02:01:42.294 --> 02:01:44.530
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY

02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:45.564
FOR FOUR YEAR DEGREES AND I HOPE

02:01:45.631 --> 02:01:47.199
THAT THAT SERVES AS A MODEL FOR

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:48.634
OTHER UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE

02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:50.236
COUNTRY AS WELL. ONE OF THE

02:01:50.302 --> 02:01:51.003
THINGS THAT I DID WANT TO SAY

02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:52.304
WITH REGARD TO SINGLE USE

02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:54.573
PLASTICS IS THAT I SEE WHEN I GO

02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:55.574
TO THE GROCERY STORE THAT THERE

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:57.710
ARE STILL PLASTIC BAGS.

02:01:57.777 --> 02:01:59.211
THAT I THINK ARE NOT TECHNICALLY

02:01:59.278 --> 02:02:01.147
SINGLE USE BECAUSE THE PLASTIC

02:02:01.213 --> 02:02:02.982
IS ACTUALLY THICKER.

02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:04.550
SO THEY'RE HIGHLY DISPOSABLE.

02:02:04.617 --> 02:02:05.818
SO I CAN ENVISION THAT HAPPENING

02:02:05.885 --> 02:02:07.453
WITH PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES WHICH

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:11.123
IS ONE OF COAST BIG ISSUES --

02:02:11.190 --> 02:02:12.692
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IF WE

02:02:12.758 --> 02:02:14.260
PHASE OUT AND BANNED SINGLE USE

02:02:14.326 --> 02:02:15.861
WATER BOTTLES THAT THE LANGUAGE

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:17.196
IS APPROPRIATE.

02:02:17.263 --> 02:02:18.064
SO THAT WE DON'T JUST END UP

02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:20.199
WITH PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES THAT

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:21.500
SOMEHOW ARE NOT TECHNICALLY

02:02:21.567 --> 02:02:22.902
SINGLE USE.

02:02:22.968 --> 02:02:24.170
THE OTHER THING I THINK WE NEED

02:02:24.236 --> 02:02:25.137
TO CONSIDER AS WE GO FORWARD AS

02:02:25.204 --> 02:02:26.672
THE ECONOMY AND THE ECONOMIC

02:02:26.739 --> 02:02:28.607
IMPACT THIS ECONOMY I THINK

02:02:28.674 --> 02:02:30.209
THRIVES TO A LARGE EXTENT ON

02:02:30.276 --> 02:02:31.811
SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND A

02:02:31.877 --> 02:02:33.412
DISPOSABLE ECONOMY.

02:02:33.479 --> 02:02:34.346
I'M IN FAVOR OF THE OBVIOUSLY

02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:37.049
CHANGING THE WAY THAT IN ORDER

02:02:37.116 --> 02:02:38.184
TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE NEED TO

02:02:38.250 --> 02:02:39.685
INCORPORATE THAT ASPECT OF IT AS

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:40.886
WELL SO WE CAN ENSURE.

02:02:40.953 --> 02:02:43.122
PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS AND AND

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:47.293
SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRY THANK YOU.

THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:03:23.562 --> 02:03:24.797
PIECES OF LEGISLATION OVER

02:03:24.864 --> 02:03:26.298
SEVERAL YEARS THE LAST SEVERAL

02:03:26.365 --> 02:03:28.267
YEARS TO ADDRESS --

WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE

02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:39.311
COMMENTS THAT.

02:03:39.378 --> 02:03:40.913
WHAT WE REALLY NEED GOING

02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:42.548
FORWARD IS MORE A MORE

02:03:42.615 --> 02:03:44.250

ADDRESSING THE SINGLE USE

02:03:45.584 --> 02:03:47.620
PLASTICS CRISIS AND WE BELIEVE

02:03:47.686 --> 02:03:49.655
THAT RECYCLING IS IMPORTANT AND

02:03:49.722 --> 02:03:50.823
SHOULD BE PROMOTED --

02:03:50.890 --> 02:03:52.658
BUT RECYCLING ALONE ISN'T THE

02:03:52.725 --> 02:03:54.426
ANSWER WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS --

02:03:54.493 --> 02:03:57.096
SOURCE REDUCTION AND OBVIOUSLY

02:03:57.163 --> 02:03:57.463
THEIR EFFORTS --

02:03:57.530 --> 02:04:00.299

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.988
GOOD MORNING --

02:04:23.055 --> 02:04:24.590
MY NAME IS STEVE WILSON AND THE

02:04:24.657 --> 02:04:26.091
CAMPAIGN'S DIRECTOR AT THE STORY

02:04:26.158 --> 02:04:28.227
OF STUFF PROJECT. ONE OF THANK

02:04:28.294 --> 02:04:29.695
YOU ALL --

02:04:29.762 --> 02:04:31.497
FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND

02:04:31.564 --> 02:04:32.865
TAKES VERY LEADERSHIP --

02:04:32.932 --> 02:04:34.700
CHAIRMAN ALAN.

02:04:34.767 --> 02:04:36.669
I HAVE OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVE

02:04:36.735 --> 02:04:38.470
BEEN FILMING OF A MOVIE CALLED

02:04:38.537 --> 02:04:40.573
THE STORY OF PLASTIC AND WE'RE

02:04:40.639 --> 02:04:42.708
LOOKING AT PLASTIC POLLUTION

02:04:42.775 --> 02:04:45.077
FROM EXTRACTION ALL THE WAY TO

02:04:45.144 --> 02:04:46.212
DISPOSAL ALL THE WAY TO THE

02:04:46.278 --> 02:04:47.680
OCEAN.

02:04:47.746 --> 02:04:49.849
WE FILMED ON THREE CONTINENTS.

02:04:49.915 --> 02:04:52.051
AND SOME OF THE MOST STARTLING

02:04:52.117 --> 02:04:53.519
THINGS I'VE SEEN --

02:04:53.586 --> 02:04:55.154
OUR IN OUR OWN COUNTRY THERE IS

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.822
A QUESTION BY SENATOR EARLIER

02:04:56.889 --> 02:04:59.091
ABOUT WHAT IS THE UNITED STATES

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:00.259
CONTRIBUTION TO PLASTIC

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:01.560
POLLUTION.

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:03.162
AND I CAN SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY IT'S

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:05.030
NUMBER.

02:05:05.097 --> 02:05:06.966
ONE AND WHY I SAY THAT IS

02:05:07.032 --> 02:05:08.701
BECAUSE COLLECTIVELY THE

02:05:08.767 --> 02:05:10.269
PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY HAS

02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:11.971
INVESTED TWO HUNDRED BILLION

02:05:12.037 --> 02:05:12.938
DOLLARS.

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:14.106
INTO ADDITIONAL REFINING

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:17.109
CAPACITY FOR PLASTIC FEEDSTOCKS.

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:19.311
THEIR PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED AND

02:05:19.378 --> 02:05:20.880
TWENTY FIVE AS SAYING CRACKERS

02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:23.082
AND WE ARE EXPORTING THIS TO

02:05:23.148 --> 02:05:25.818
CHINA AND WE ARE EXPORTING THIS

02:05:25.885 --> 02:05:26.585
TO EUROPE.

02:05:26.652 --> 02:05:28.320
SO PLASTIC POLLUTION THAT

02:05:28.387 --> 02:05:30.556
ORIGINATESFROM A RIVER IN THE

02:05:30.623 --> 02:05:31.924
PHILIPPINES.

02:05:31.991 --> 02:05:36.228
ULTIMATELY ORIGINATED FROM A THE

02:05:36.295 --> 02:05:38.564
OHIO RIVER VALLEY OR IN

02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:40.900
APPALACHIA OR IN NORTH DAKOTA.

02:05:40.966 --> 02:05:43.035
WE ARE HE LARGEST EXPORTER OF

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:45.237
OIL AND GAS AT THIS POINT.

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:46.739
THE GOAL OF THE PETROCHEMICAL

02:05:46.805 --> 02:05:48.874
INDUSTRY IS TO PUT 40% MORE

02:05:48.941 --> 02:05:53.078
PLASTIC INTO COMMERCE BY.

02:05:53.145 --> 02:05:53.679
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO IF WE

02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:55.414
THINK ABOUT THAT THAT MEANS

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:58.317
EVERY GARBAGE CAN AND OUR ENTIRE

02:05:58.384 --> 02:06:01.887
COUNTRY NEEDS TO BE 40% BIGGER.

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:02.888
AND I'VE ALSO SEEN WHERE THIS

02:06:02.955 --> 02:06:04.890
STUFF GOES AND WE TALK ABOUT

02:06:04.957 --> 02:06:05.858
RECYCLING.

02:06:05.925 --> 02:06:08.560
AND I WAS INSERTED BY INDONESIA.

02:06:08.627 --> 02:06:10.663
AND I WAS IN A FIELD WHERE YOU

02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:12.331
CANNOT SEE THE GROUND ALL YOU

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:13.532
CAN SEE IS TREES AND SHRUBS

02:06:13.599 --> 02:06:15.100
STICKING OUT.

02:06:15.167 --> 02:06:16.502
AND YOU GO THROUGH THIS WASTE.

02:06:16.568 --> 02:06:17.770
AND YOU ARE PICKING OUT TRADER

02:06:17.836 --> 02:06:19.338
JOE'S YOU'RE PICKING OUT

02:06:19.405 --> 02:06:21.840
STARBUCKS YOU'RE PICKING OUT A A

02:06:21.907 --> 02:06:23.842
RP CARDS SO IT'S OBVIOUS WHERE

02:06:23.909 --> 02:06:25.177
IT'S COMING FROM.

02:06:25.244 --> 02:06:27.179
THERE IS NO WHERE FOR THIS STUFF

02:06:27.246 --> 02:06:28.547
TO GO IT'S WHY CHINA CLOSED ITS

02:06:28.614 --> 02:06:31.350
DOORS VIETNAM HAS JUST DONE IT

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:33.085
INDIA'S DONE IT MALAYSIA'S

02:06:33.152 --> 02:06:34.753
PARTIALLY DOING IT --

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.689
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THERE IS

02:06:36.755 --> 02:06:39.758
NO AWAY AND THERE IS A MASS OF

02:06:39.825 --> 02:06:41.393
GLUT OF PLASTIC COMING.

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:43.929
AND UNTIL WE FIX THE SYSTEM.

02:06:43.996 --> 02:06:44.697
WE ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE

02:06:44.763 --> 02:06:46.699
PROBLEM WE NEED TO REDUCE BY

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:47.800
SOURCE.

02:06:47.866 --> 02:06:49.635
WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE AND FIX

02:06:49.702 --> 02:06:52.104
THE RECYCLING ECONOMICS HERE IN

02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:52.738
CALIFORNIA.

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:57.009
IT IS AN ETHICAL TO EXPORT WAY

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:59.311
AND I SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO IT IS

02:06:59.378 --> 02:07:01.680
OPENLY BURNED IT IS USED AS FUEL

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:03.148
AND TOFU FACTORIES.

02:07:03.215 --> 02:07:05.317
AND PLACES WITH NO ENVIRONMENTAL

02:07:05.384 --> 02:07:07.286
CONTROLS SO.

02:07:07.353 --> 02:07:08.754
THE IMPORTANCE OF US TAKING A

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:10.356
SYSTEMIC APPROACH AND A

02:07:10.422 --> 02:07:13.025
COMPREHENSIVE BILL IN CALIFORNIA.

02:07:13.092 --> 02:07:14.793
WILL SET PRECEDENT. FOR THE

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:17.262
ENTIRE COUNTRY AND IT'S OUR GOAL

02:07:17.329 --> 02:07:18.597
AND OUR ORGANIZATIONAL SCHOOL TO

02:07:18.664 --> 02:07:20.265
USE THIS MODEL ON A MULTI STATE

02:07:20.332 --> 02:07:23.068
STRATEGY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:23.969
ON MICHAEL B..

02:07:24.036 --> 02:07:25.637
CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST TO

02:07:25.704 --> 02:07:27.373
ACTON MICROBEADS THEY ARE NOW

02:07:27.439 --> 02:07:29.675
