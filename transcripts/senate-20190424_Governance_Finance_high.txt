TO BUY CHAIR MORLOCK THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I I JUST WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK YOU AND ALSO -- CENTER BELL. FOR WORKING -- INTENSIVELY WITH ME AND WITH MY STAFF FOR A PERIOD OF MONTHS A RESOLUTION SO THAT WE CAN ALL. MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER -- ON SB FIFTY ON MY THANK YOU -- FOR FOR WORKING WITH US AND I THINK WE HAVE A VERY VERY STRONG. AGREEMENT ON SB -- FIFTY THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS OF THE DEEP HOUSING CRISIS THAT CALIFORNIA FACES -- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT WE HEAR ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS A LOT. IS. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A HOUSING SHORTAGE OF THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES. TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT I THAT IS EQUAL TO THE HOUSING DEFICIT OF THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES COMBINED. SO FOR THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THE ENTIRE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN THIS COUNTRY ONE HALF OF IT IS IN ONE STATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- CALIFORNIA RANKS NUMBER FORTY NINE OUT OF FIFTY STATES IN HOMES PER CAPITA. FORTY NINE OUT OF FIFTY STATES HOMES PER CAPITA THAT'S CALIFORNIA -- IT AND IF ANYONE HAD ANY -- WONDER AS TO WHY PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HEREANYMORE. WE TALK ABOUT A LOT OF TECHNICAL. STUFF AROUND HOUSING IN THIS BILL IT'S ABOUT ZONING WE TALK ABOUT STREAMLINING WE TALK ABOUT -- SEQUEL -- TECHNICAL TERMS WHICH ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT -- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE AFFECTED. BY CALIFORNIA'S ABYSMAL FAILURE. TO PRODUCE ENOUGH HOUSING OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF DECADES. WE USED TO PRODUCE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES 200-500-0023 HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING PER YEAR IN CALIFORNIA AT A TIME WHEN WE HAD A POPULATION OF FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. WE NOW HAVE ALMOST THREE TIMES A POPULATION FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND GROWING. AND INSTEAD OF PRODUCING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS PER YEAR RIGHT NOW PRODUCING. EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS WITH GONE DOWN BY ABOUT TWO THIRDS AS OUR POPULATION. TRIPLED. AND REAL PEOPLE ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW -- IN CALIFORNIA WE SEE THE HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE WHICH IS GROWING AT ALTHOUGH MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION ARE PARTS OF THE HOMELESS SUBATOMIC. MANY MANY HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE NOT MENTALLY ILL ARE NOT ADDICTED THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING AS OF THEIR SLEEPING IN SHELTERS OR IN THEIR CARS OR CAL SURFING. CULTURE BRING ONE IN -- TWENTY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA ONE IN TWENTY IS HOMELESS. EVERYONE KNOWS A FAMILY OR MANY FAMILIES WHO HAVE MOVED AWAY. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE THEY HAD THAT SECOND KID AND THEY NEEDED MORE SPACE AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE COMMUNITY. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD AND SO THEY ARE NOW COMMUTING TO OURS OR MAYBE THEY'RE LIVING IN DENVER OR AUSTIN. ARE WE ARE METHODICALLY PUSHING THE MIDDLE CLASS OUT OF MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE MAKING A PROGRESSIVELY HARDER. FOR WORKING FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE. AND WE ARE MAKING IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ABOUT BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF HAVING STABLE HOUSING. YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T SEE WHAT THEIR FUTURE IS AND OUR COMMUNITY AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTED I REALLY WISH THAT MY KID COULD MOVE BACK HOME AFTER COLLEGE BUT UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE IN MY BASEMENT -- THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IN THE TOWN IN WHICH I GREW UP. TO THIS IT IS THESE OF HUMAN CONSEQUENCES. OF OUR FRANKLY DELIBERATE FAILURE TO BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING WITH ADOPTED WHAT I CALL HOUSING LAST POLICY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'VE EFFECTIVELY SIDE -- THAT IT IS NOT A PRIORITY TO HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING FOR EVERYONE. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS -- THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO TURN THIS AROUND AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HAPPENING IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR -- TO INCREASE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING. AT ALL INCOME LEVELS HI INCLUDING SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND TO FIND IT. HOW TO PROTECT OU TENANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY STAY -- IN THE HOMES -- THAT THEY HAVE. WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO AND THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET NO ONE BILL OR OR NO ONE ISSUE IS GOING TO FIX OUR HOUSING CRISIS BUT ONE BUILDING BLOCK A FOUNDATIONAL BUILDING BLOCK. OR ON HOUSING ZONING -- BECAUSE CAN HAVE ALL THE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE WORLD ALL THE STREAMLINING IN THE WORLD BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S ILLEGAL TO BUILD THE HOUSING BECAUSE OF ZONING. THAT IT'S ALL FOR NAUGHT. AND THE REALITY IS THAT IN 80% OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS ILLEGAL. TO BUILD ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME -- IT'S TRUE IN 70% OF SAN pFRANCISCO TO LEGAL BUILD ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME OR TO UNIT SAME WITH LOS ANGELES. AND IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE IF WE'RE GOING TO FILL THAT THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOME -- DEFICIT. THE QUESTION IS WHERE ARE WE GOING TO BUILD THAT HOUSING -- AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BILL THAT HOUSING WHERE THE JOBS ARE. WHERE THERE'S TRANSIT AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING A AND A VERY SUSTAINABLE WAY AND THAT'S WHAT SB FIFTY WILL ALLOW US TO DO -- THIS BILL -- WILL ALLOW FOR INCREASED DENSITY IN JOB RICH AREAS NEAR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND THEN LATER DENSITY INCREASES ELSEWHERE. TO FILL THAT THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOME -- DEFICIT -- UNDER THE AMENDMENTS SO WE ARE AGREEING TO WITH THE CHAIR -- TODAY -- FOR COUNTIES OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE -- THE AT THE EXISTING SB FIFTY RAIL AND FERRY PROVISIONS WILL SANTA FACT. OF THE JOB RICH PROVISIONS WILL STAY IN EFFECT ON CHANGE -- AND FOR BEHIND THE BUS STOP PROVISIONS WILL STAY IN EFFECT EXCEPT WE WILL REQUIRE -- INCREASED FREQUENCY HAD WAYS DURING RUSH HOUR OF EVERY TEN MINUTES. I INSTEAD OF EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES OF THAT WILL A SOMEWHAT NARROW -- THE ELIGIBLE BUS STOPS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRULY. A ROBUST -- BUS SERVICE AND WILL CONTINUE -- TO REQUIRE SEVEN DAY A WEEK ROBUST -- BUS SERVICE SIMILAR TO ARE THE SAME AS CURRENTLY REQUIRED -- UNDER SB -- FIFTY WE HAVE -- A AND IN ADDITION A COUNTIES OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BY THE PARKING PROVISIONS IN SB -- FIFTY WILL REMAIN IN PLACE. WE HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT RELATING TO THE COASTAL ZONE -- SB -- FIFTY DID NOT TREAT THE COASTAL ZONE ANY DIFFERENTLY -- WORDS AS BEFORE EXAM TO THE COASTAL ZONE -- SB FIFTY WILL APPLY IN THE COASTAL ZONE TO CITIES OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE. WE ALSO A RECENT AGREEMENT AROUND HISTORIC DISTRICTS -- SB -- FIFTY DEFERRED TO THE EXISTING RULES FOR HISTORIC DISTRICTS AS BEFORE EXEMPTED -- HISTORIC DISTRICTS -- WE REACH AN AGREEMENT -- THAT -- FOR HISTORIC SINCE HER HISTORIC DISTRICTS THAT WERE APPROVED. BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN FIVE A WILL BE GRANDFATHERED IN AND WILL. NOT BE PART OF THE BILL -- IF FOR CONTRIBUTING STRUCTURES WITHIN THOSE SIZE STORY DISTRICTS -- FOR OTHER HISTORIC DISTRICTS -- THE HISTORIC DISTRICT RULES FROM THE STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DENSITY BONUS PROGRAM -- WILL APPLY TO THOSE EXISTING HISTORIC -- RULES -- WE ALSO -- HAVE AGREED -- THAT WE WILL -- AND THIS IS -- TAKEN FROM THE LARGER FROM AS BEFORE HI THAT WE WILL ALLOW -- STATEWIDE FOR PLEXUS. BY RIGHTS. HI AND I WILL LEAVE THAT AMENDMENTS ABOUT IN A LAW CENTER REQUIRED TO TALK ABOUT. THE RULES AND COUNTIES UNDER. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE -- SO -- WITH THAT SAID -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AGAIN THANK YOU -- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK GOD BEFORE WE GET TO OUR WITNESSES. MISTER CURRENT YES SO THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER WINNER WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO IS TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR AND THEN SENATOR BELL AND I ARE GOING TO BE JOINING CENTER WIENER -- AT THE TABLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A PRESENTATION WELCOME SENATORS. MCGUIRE I CAN ASK ONE THING IS COULD YOU MAKE IT INTERESTING. THE TIME HEY THERE WE GO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT. TO BE ABLE TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR WIENER. UP FOR HIS WORK ON THIS ISSUE OVER THESE PAST MANY MONTHS. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS IN ALL WHO ARE GATHERED TODAY OVER THE PAST SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS. CENTER BELL CENTRE WINNER IN AYE A PARTNER IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST HEARING DISCUSS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN HOW TO ADDRESS IT FURTHER. IN REGARD TO STATE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS. OUR SECOND HEARING FOCUS ON LAND USE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO ENABLE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE MARKET RATE HOUSING POSSIBLE. THE THIRD DRILL DOWN ON ZONING CHALLENGES THAT ARISE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. AFTER A SERIES OF HEARINGS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS FACED WITH A SERIES OF COMPLEX CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILD OUT OF HOUSING. HIGHLAND PRICES. THE LACK OF HOUSING STOCK ASSOCIATED WITH DEMAND. THE LACK OF ONGOING SUSTAINABLE FORD WILL HOUSING. AND THAT LACK OF A SUSTAINABLE REVENUE SOURCE. REGULATORY HURDLES. HI COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BURNING PERMITTING ANY YES. ZONING ANY INABILITY IN SOME JURISDICTIONS A BILL STRATEGIC IN THE HOUSE. LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME TO BETTER OUR BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT. THAT'S FACING US. AND WE MUST HAVE A LASER FOCUS ON THE BUILD OUT OF WORK FORCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL. HERE'S WHY. AS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO STATED THE TRUE CRISIS EXISTS WITH THE WORKING POOR AND THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THIS STATE. BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE ARE SHORT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AFFORDABLE UNITS ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE. THE STATE NEEDS TO DEVELOP A PERMANENT REVENUE SOURCE TO HELP SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY CENTER BALLOT I'VE ALSO INTRODUCED SB FIVE WHICH WOULD DELIVER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ANNUALLY FOR WORK FORCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY. THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE FOR HIS OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE. NOW WITH THE ISSUE AT HAND EVERY CITY AND COUNTY IN THE GOLDEN STATE NEED TO DO THEIR PART. WHAT HOUSING? AND AS I'VE SAID. FOR THE PAST MANY MONTHS. THIS STRATEGY OF NO -- NO LONGER WORKS. AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE DIFFERENCES OF JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE AS THE GOVERNOR SAID JUST LAST WEEK. A BLANKET ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERY COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S WHY CENTER BELL AND I BROUGHT FORWARD AS BEFORE. I TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE STOP PULL STRATEGIES. AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE MANY SIZE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. AND TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL. WE ALSO KNOW THAT CENTER WIENER WAS ON A PARALLEL TRACK. IN IS WORKING ON HIS OWN APPROACH. AND WE ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT A JOINT SOLUTION THAT COMBINES ASPECTS OF SB FIFTEEN AS BEFORE. SB FOUR WILL BE HELD IN COMMITTEE TODAY IN SB FIFTY WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH CRITICAL CHANGES THAT ENSURES THE DIFFERENCES AMONG COMMUNITIES ARE DRESSED. DINNER WIENER HAS PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT SB FIFTY WILL DO IN LARGER COUNTIES AND I'D LIKE TO NOW BE ABLE TO PRESENT. BUT WHAT THE AMENDED VERSION OF SB FIFTY WILL DO IN SOME SUBURBAN AND RURAL COUNTIES. WITHOUT IN MIND WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE POPULATION IS SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OR FEWER. IN CITIES WITH FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION IT UP. WITHIN THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION THRESHOLD. THREE DO YOU CAN FILL HOUSING FOCUS WITHIN A HALF MILE OF SIX PASSENGER RAIL OR FERRY TERMINALS WILL BE ALLOWED. NO BUS STOPS WILL BE IN THESE. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION COUNTIES. THEY WERE NEVER IN SB. FOUR ONE STORY OF ADDITIONAL HEIGHTS WOULD BE ALLOWED ON THE HOUSING ABOVE THE CURRENT ZONING PLUS DENSITY WOULD BONUS. BY RIGHT AROUND RAIL AND FERRY STATIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A THREE STORY. ZONE OF A HOUSING YOUR MAX STORIES. THREE SB FOUR WOULD ALLOW YOU TO GO TO FOUR STORIES. REGARDING PARKING. CITIES WITH A POPULATION OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE WITH IN A COUNTY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OR LESS. NO PARKING WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A PASSENGER RAIL FERRY TERMINAL. POINT FIVE PARKING SPOTS A QUARTER MILE TO FIVE POINT FIVE MILES. CITIES WITH A POPULATION OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR LESS WITHIN A COUNTY OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND UNLESS. POINT FIVE PARKING SPOTS WITHIN A HALF MILE FROM PASSENGER RAIL OR PASSENGER FERRY. HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE HISTORIC DISTRICTS IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED. BY WRITER TO APPROVAL OF FOUR PLEX IS TO STRATEGICALLY SPREAD OUT HOUSING COMMUNITIES WOULD BE ALLOWED ON LAND ZONED RESIDENTIAL. NO DEMOLITIONS OF HIS EX EXISTING EXISTING STRUCTURES WOULD BE ALLOWED. BUT CONVERSIONS OF HIS EXISTING STRUCTURES TO FOUR PLEX IS WOULD BE ALLOWED AS LONG AS THEY MEET EXISTING ZONING STANDARDS SUCH AS SET BACKS IN HEIGHT. IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE POINT FIVE PARKING SPOTS PER UNIT AS WELL. WE KNOW THAT THE GREATEST NEED FOR HOUSING IS WITHIN THE LOW IN VERY LOW CATEGORIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AS YOU HEARD CENTER WIENER IS COMMITTED TO CRITICAL IN LO FI HOUSING AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT. WHERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS BUILT OFF SITE? BUT IT ACTUALLY GETS PERMITTED IN CONSTRUCTED AT THE SAME TIME. AS MARKET RATE HOUSING. AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE INCLUSIONARY PERCENTAGES IN THE BILL. TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL'S GAINS ARE FAIRLY DISTRIBUTED AND ADDRESSING ARE TRUE CRISIS IN THE STATE AND THAT'S THE LACK OF WORK FORCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ONLY DID HERE MISTER CHAIR. I'LL SAY THAT THIS IS NOT AN EASY BILL. WELL THERE NEED TO BE MORE WORK YOU BETCHA. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. THE CHANGES IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE PROVIDES A PATH FORWARD. FOR CATALYZING CHANGE WITHOUT IRANIAN OVER DIFFERENCES IN CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE SET OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IT SETS US ON A PATH BUT DOESN'T ADOPT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. AND IT SURE IS THAT CHANGE DOES COME. TO COMMUNITIES BIG AND SMALL. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE BUT BEFORE WE DO MISTER CHAIR LIKE A BETTER TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR BATTLE. WHO HAS BEEN A PARTNER IN ALL OF THIS AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE TENANTS FROM SAN JOSE FOR ALL OF HIS WORK CENTER ABOUT? THANK YOU THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT WE ALL SPENT ON THIS AND I THINK IT. HAS RESULTED IN A PRODUCTIVE. SAID OF LEGISLATION THAT CAN WORK -- SO COMBINING SB FIFTY AN S. BEFORE INTO A COMPROMISE I THINK IS THE CORRECT THING TO DO. IT IS A COMPROMISE. THE THINGS IN HERE I A AM NERVOUS ABOUT -- AND THERE'S THINGS IN HERE I REALLY LIKE. SO -- I BELIEVE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE WORKED.% TOGETHER IN ESPECIALLY IN THE SENATE HEREAND WE DEVELOP SOME HOUSING PACKAGE LEGISLATION WE ACHIEVED. OF PROPOSITION ONE THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS --IN -- THE LAST -- NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ELECTION. AND INVALIDATED OUR EFFORTS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING ISSUE PROPOSITION. TWO OF ACTUALLY VALIDATED IT FURTHER BY -- SAYING THEY WANT SOMETHING TO DO ABOUT HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE HAD TO PROPOSITIONS ACTUALLY VALIDATED. OF THE WORK THAT WE DID AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN MOVING FORWARD FROM THERE WE NEED TO DEVELOP A PACKAGE. OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS IN. TWENTY NINETEEN OF AND TWENTY NINETEEN WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF OUR RESTRICTIONS -- OF DEVELOPING A MORE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY APPROACH IN TERMS OF URBAN PLANNING CHANGING THE PLANNING -- DESIGN OF CALIFORNIA TO MORE SUSTAINABLE PLANNING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND PRODUCE A MORE EFFECTIVE -- TRANSPORTATION SOLUTION FOR CALIFORNIANS AND I BELIEVE THAT -- THE COMBINATION OF SB FIFTY S. BEFORE WELL ACTUALLY DO THAT. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT -- WE NEED TO APPROACH THE OTHERS PRONGS OF THE SOLUTION HOUSING. WHICH IS FINDING VACANT LAND FINDING LAND THAT'S AVAILABLE -- FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE HAVE SB SIX THE GOVERNOR IS WORKING ON OF SURPLUS STATE PROPERTIES WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. AND THAT SB FIVE AND OTHER LEGISLATION DEALING WITH FINANCING HOUSING CALIFORNIA HAS LONG. UNDER FINANCED HOUSING EVEN WHEN WE HAD REDEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION WE OF UNDER FINANCED. OF THE FUNDING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE NEED IT MORE DESPERATELY NOW THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE OF THE COST OF HOUSING. IS SO HIGH FOR THE LOW AN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY CALIFORNIA HAS SUCH A HIGH -- POVERTY RATE IS THE CAR THE CONSTANT STRESS OF PEOPLE WORKING TWO TO THREE JOBS TO PAY FOR THEIR HOUSING. AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND FINANCE IT I THINK THE COMBINATION OF ALL THESE BILLS -- AS A PACKAGE WILL RESULT IN HELPING CALIFORNIANS -- HAVE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I URGE EVERYBODY SUPPORT THE PACKAGE OF BILLS WE NEED TO APPROACH IT FROM A MULTI FACETED BASIS. AND I THINK THAT'S WERE TRYING TO DO HERE SO THANK YOU FOR JERRY MCGUIRE CENTER WINNER AND THE OTHER LEGISLATORS THAT. ARE APPROACHING THIS HOUSING -- COMPLEX ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR CAN SUPPORT. THE EFFORTS THAT WE ARE MAKING IN THESE IN THIS REGARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR BELL AS CENTER WINNER IF IT WORKS FOR YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO READ OUT THE AMENDMENT SO THAT EVERYONE IS IN -- ON THE SAME PAGE WITH CENTER WINNER DID YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING FOR ONE THING.

A RECENT MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SOCIETY HAS ONLY HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. ARE PROUD TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT. I WANT TO COMMEND OF THIS COMMITTEE YOURSELF YOUR CHAIRMANSHIP A SENATOR B&lt;c.cyan&gt; OF&lt;/c&gt; COURSE SENATOR WIENER. FOR WORKING TOGETHER ON THE SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT YOU JUST OUTLINED -- IN MANY RESPECTS THE SENATE IS LIKE A BIG FAMILY AND SOMETIMES A FAMILY HAS DISAGREEMENTS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE TO RELATE THAT AS AS AS SUCH. THE HOUSE OF THE SENATE YOU ALL CAME TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT'S AFFECTING WORKING FAMILIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. AND DIFFERENT REGIONS FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS. FOR US IN THE BUILDING TRADES WE REPRESENT WORKING FAMILIES THEY FOR GONE A LOT OF THEIR RAISES AND GAUNT STRICTLY TO THE RENT OR TO THE COST OF HOUSING. THIS FOR ME IS A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE NOT ONLY BECAUSE I REPRESENT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO INTEND TO BUILD THOSE HOMES AND PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISADVANTAGED YOUTH. AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR A CAREER IN CONSTRUCTION AND TO THE AN ENTRY INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE MY FAMILY IS DEEPLY IMPACTED BY THIS ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I AM BLESSED ENOUGH TO HAVE A UNION JOB I HAVE A HOME. SACRAMENTO BUT MY FAMILY IN SAN FRANCISCO IS STRUGGLING MY MOTHER SHE'S ON SECTION EIGHT I HAVE A BROTHER WHO IS HOMELESS I HAVE A BROTHER WILL ALSO RENTS HI RENTS IN THE DALY CITY AREA PAYS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SUCH. FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. AND HE HAS BARELY STARTED STRUGGLING HE CAN'T AFFORD EVEN TO BUY A CAR HAD A SOULS CAR. ANOTHER BROTHER WHO LIVES IN A ROOM. HE PLAYS HE PAYS CLOSE TO NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS WITHOUT ACCESS TO ACTUAL KITCHEN. FOR ME THIS IS DEEPLY PERSONAL I WANT TO COMMAND ON THE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS THAT YOU PROVIDED BECAUSE IN MY BELIEVE ALL OF THESE SOLUTIONS IMPACT MY FAMILY IN A VERY POSITIVE POSITIVE WAY. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HOUSING HOUSING IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU ARE PRESENTING HERE NOT ONLY IN THIS. PARTICULAR BILL BUT AS A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF SOLUTIONS WITH OTHER LEGISLATION IS GOING TO DIRECTLY IMPACT THAT. SENATE PROTECTIONS AGAINST INFECTIONS RENT CONTROL ISSUES. BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING SO THAT IN THE FUTURE WE'RE LOOKING TO ACTUALLY BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THE MOST BUT ALSO FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE. PERHAPS IN THE INCOME AREAS THAT THEY WANT TO GET INTO WHEN THEY IN TURN A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM AND EARNED ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR I CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUBSIDIES. TO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE THE THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER DE AS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO GO SECOND. WELCOME SERVICE PERSON LAST ORGANIZATION TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ON MICHAEL GUNNING HERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. I TOO WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU AND CENTERS BELL AND WIENER AND THE COMMITTEE. AND STAFF FOR WORKING SO HARD TO COME TO THIS AGREEMENT AS THE THE ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS OVER THREE THOUSAND BUILDERS AND HOME BUILDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHERE THE FOLKS ACTUALLY ARE GOING TO BE BUILDING THESE HOUSES AND THIS IS CERTAINLY A CREATIVE SOLUTION -- TWO AND A DESPERATE PROBLEM I'M A LOT OF YOU HEARD MY TESTIMONY IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE WE HAVE DESIGNATED SB FIFTY AS A HOUSING CREATOR. WHICH MEANS THAT IT INCREASES PRODUCTION SUPPLY HOMEOWNERSHIP AND TRIES TO GET PEOPLE HOUSE. I THINK SIMILAR TO MY FRIEND MISTER DE AS AS AS THE SON OF IMMIGRANTS BOTH OF MY PARENTS CAME HERE FROM THE COUNTRY OF JAMAICA. AND THEY KNEW THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP WAS THE WAY TO SUCCEED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND MY MOM A THIRTY YEAR TEACHER MY FATHER A CIVIL ENGINEER THEY BOUGHT THEIR FIRST HOUSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS THE MEANS TO PUT ME AND MY BROTHER. TO COLLEGE SO HOMEOWNERSHIP IS IMPORTANT TOO MANY PEOPLE NOW DAYS NOT HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND WE CLEARLY SEE SB FIFTY AS A WAY TO DO THAT AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS RUNNING GRATEFUL COUNCILMEMBER FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN BOWERS COUNCILMEMBER FOR THE CITY OF EMERYVILLE. THE CITY'S FORMER MAYOR -- HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIFTY PERHAPS NOT THE MOST TRADITIONAL SPEAKER IN SUPPORT OF A BILL WITHOUT A ROOM FULL OF FIVE GOOD FOLKS. WHO ARE ADVOCATING I JUST THE I BELIEVE FOR TEN AND PROTECTIONS AND OTHER ISSUES ARE PROFESSIONALLY I'VE SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS AND OUT? ISSUES I WAS ATTENDED TOURNEY IN CHICAGO FOR MANY YEARS AND WORKED -- DEFENDING TENANTS -- CABRINI GREEN -- I WORKED ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION THE CITY OF EMBER GO BECAME A BEFORE I BECAME A COUNCIL MEMBER -- BUT WE LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN A BUILDING AND IT'S THE SHADOW OF ASSIST SEGREGATIONIST IS OWNING PRACTICES REDLINING IN CALIFORNIA. AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING BEHIND ME HAVE IS WHAT WILL THIS BILL DUE TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS -- AS A COUNCIL MEMBER FROM A CITY THAT VOTED FIVE ZERO TO ENDORSE AND SUPPORT THIS BILL. I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT STEP AS PART OF A A A PANOPLY OF INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BRING CALIFORNIA ON TRACK AND HOUSING. AS I SEE IT THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY ISSUES AFFORDABILITY TENANT PROTECTIONS AND SUPPLY. I'M IS A LOCAL JURISDICTION WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS ON THE FRONT ON THE FIRST TWO ISSUES. CITY OF EMBER BILL PASSED THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY LAST YEAR WHICH WILL BUILD 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR RESIDENTS ACROSS OUR CITY WHO ARE AT RISK OF BEING DISPLACED. IF ENACTED LANDLORD TENANT ORDINANCE A JUST CAUSE ADDICTION ORDINANCE. WE HAVE AN INCLUSIONARY ZONING POLICY THAT IS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT CODE. REQUIRES THE INCLUSION OF UNITS ALONG SIDE OF MERCURY IN ITS BILL BY A PRIVATE DEVELOPER. HE RECENTLY UPS OWNER TRANSIT QUARTER SAN PABLO AVENUE. BUILDING EIGHTY SEVEN UNIT TWO TO FOUR BEDROOM. ALL A 100% FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING STRUCTURE THERE AND WE'VE JUST PUT OUT AN RFP TO BUILD AN INTERGENERATIONAL HOUSING PROJECT FOR SENIORS AND FOSTER YOUTH. PEOPLE PROPOSED ELIMINATE PARKING MINIMUMS AND WE'VE INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO THE HIGHEST MINIMUM WAGE IN OUR NATION. WE ALSO PROVIDE A FREE TRANSIT SHUTTLE WHY AM I SHARING ALL THESE THINGS THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT LOCAL AGENCIES CAN DO TODAY. ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN'T DO IS CONTROL OUR NEIGHBORS ZONE FOR HOUSING ALONG TRANSIT QUARTERS. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE ALTHOUGH SUPPLY APPEARS TO BE A MARKET DRIVEN ISSUE IN IT IN A IN A NARROW SPACE COULD BE CONSTRUED AS THE THE TOTAL SCOPE OF THIS BILL THIS IS REALLY PART. OF A BIGGER SET OF INTERVENTIONS THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE SUSTAINALE PLACE MAKE IT MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY HELP US TO FILL OUR CLIMATE ACTION GOALS AND HELP CREATE EQUITY IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE WHO FOR A LONG TIME HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO LIVE OR WORK NEAR -- FAMILY OR JOBS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH KANSEN NEVER PLAYED IS IN GERMAN WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO GO TO THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

SO MA'AM YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AND THEY WERE GRANT THREE WITNESSES WHO ARE SECONDARY OF TWO MINUTES EACH AGAIN EQUAL TIME FOR ALL SIDES. THE FLOOR IS YOURS MA'AM. HI MY NAME IS SHANTI THING I'M REPRESENTING TENANTS TOGETHER CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION FOR RENTERS RATES -- WE ORGANIZED IN OUR THIRTY SIX MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALLIES AND PARTNERS -- WHICH THEY'RE MORE ORGANIZED WITH THE VICTIMS OF GENTRIFICATION DISPLACING CALIFORNIA THESE ARE OUR COMMUNITIES THESE ARE WHERE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ROOTED WHERE ORGANIZER'S COME FROM. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT WE HAVE WITNESSED FIRSTHAND THE POLITICS OF EXCLUSION THE TELL OUR RENTER'S SEVENTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIA -- ANSWERS ALMOST HALF OF THE POPULATION THAT THEY DO NOT DESERVE TO LIVE WHERE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE WE FEEL IS ACUTELY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SOLUTIONS TO THE HOUSING CRISIS MUST BE LED BY THOSE MOST VICTIMIZED EXERCISING THEIR VOICES FULLY IN OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS WHY WE SUPPORT GRASSROOTS TENANT ORGANIZATIONS BUT THIS IS ALSO WHY ARE THIRTY SIX MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO OPPOSE SB. FIFTY FOR COMMUNITIES TO ORGANIZE LOCALLY WHO HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED FOR DECADES IN OUR HISTORY DEVELOP A PLAN FOR EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PASS THAT PLAN THROUGH LOCAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS THIS IS WHAT WE DO THIS IS OUR ORGANIZATION'S EXPERIENCE. TAKES FAR LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS. AND REQUIRES LOCAL EMPOWERMENT LOCAL SUPPORT AND RESOURCES AS WELL AS SUPPORT WE AT THE STATE LEVEL. IT ALSO REQUIRES THOUGHTFUL PLANNING FOR DEEPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE BEING DISPLACED DOWN MASS RIGHT NOW. WE ALSO RETAIN DEEP CONCERNS THAT THE OWNERS OF ENFORCING ANTI DEMOLITION PROVISIONS WILL FALL ON THESE ALREADY STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES WERE BEARING THE BRUNT OF EVICTION AND DISPLACEMENT. WE UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL. TWELVE SEVENTY NINE WHICH DOES SOMETHING SIMILAR IT IDENTIFIES AND TARGETS JOBS RICH AREAS TO BUILD HOUSING COMMENSURATE TO THE JOBS THEY CREATE. IT'S SPECIFICALLY TACKLES THE LEGACIES OF EXCLUSIONARY ZONING -- BY TARGETING THOSE COMMUNITIES. I HAVE TO SAY THAT IF THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY TARGETED EXCLUSIONARY COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE NOT DONE THEIR PART TO SOLVE THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I THINK WE AGREE ON THAT I WOULD NOT BE SITTING USE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY VOICING MY OPPOSITION. FRANKLY WE HAVE TOO MANY DEEP CONCERNS WITH SB FIFTIES IMPACTS DESPITE THE AMENDMENTS ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHERE ORGANIZATIONS ARE BASED WHERE WE ARE ROOTED. TO SUPPORT IT HOWEVER WELL MEANING ITS INTENTIONS THANK YOU. I AM EMIGRATE OF YOUR TESTIMONY WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO SECOND. ALL RIGHT THE MORNING TWO MINUTES THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NORMA GARCIA I AM THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND ADVOCACY FOR THE MISSION ECONOMIC. DEVELOPMENT AGENCY HEADQUARTERED IN SAN FRANCISCO'S MISSION DISTRICT WHICH IS GROUND ZERO FOR GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT. ONE OF THE GROUND ZEROES IN THIS COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY A BIG GROUND ZERO FOR CALIFORNIA. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC PROCESS I WHILE I RESPECT THE WORK THAT THE SENATORS HAVE DONE TO COME UP WITH A COMPROMISE THAT SEEMS TO WORK FOR MOST -- NONE OF US ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN THE AMENDMENTS. IN FORM AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO FULLY ANALYZE THEM AND TO SEE WHERE THEY FIT INTO THE EXISTING TAX OF THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF SB FIFTY SO. AS A WORD OF PROCESS I WOULD SAY THAT WE NEED MORE CLARITY WE MAY NOT TRANSPARENCY MORE TIME TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE AMENDMENTS AS BEING PROPOSED TODAY. AND THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE THAT LOOMS LARGE OVER THIS BILL AND AND THAT IS IT EVERYONE EXPECTED SB FIFTY IS GOING TO DELIVER HOUSING FOR A CALIFORNIANS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS. BUT WHEN WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE AFFORDABILITY ASPECTS OF SB FIFTY THE VAST MAJORITY OF SB FIFTY HOUSING WILL BE MARKET RATE HOUSING. AND AS A MATTER OF FACT SB FIFTY THE MOST CURRENT DRAFT BASICALLY HAS NO AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDINGS THAT ARE UNDER TEN YOU TEN UNITS ARE UNDER. I'M SO IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING A UNIVERSE OF FOUR UNITS SMALL APARTMENT BUILDINGS HOW ARE WE GOING TO BUILD IN AFFORDABILITY THERE BECAUSE AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THOSE BUILDINGS ARE COMPLETELY EXEMPT. FROM ANY AFFORDABILITY MANDATE UNDER SB -- FIFTY THIS IS A THIS IS A VERY SWEEPING BILL AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT HOUSING IS AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS US ALL. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REZONING THE ENTIRE STATE WITHOUT A STUDY. AND I I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THAT THAT THAT IS PRUDENT I THINK THAT AS A STATE WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T GET TO A GOOD SOLUTION. IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE DONE IT THOUGHTFULLY AND THAT WE HAVE AN HARM SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES LIKE THE MISSION DISTRICT WHICH IS ACTUALLY EXCLUDED CURRENTLY FROM THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY. DEFINITION WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLE. THANK YOU SHOP MA'AM THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR YOUR WORDS. AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO BE A TO GET YOU COPY THE AMENDMENTS -- AS WELL. I HERE IN JUST A MOMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO BE A RAINY DAY DAVID RAST DIRECTOR OF PLANNING TO DEVELOPMENT CITY OF PASADENA. THE CITY OF PASADENA ACKNOWLEDGES THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. THE CITY OF PASADENA ACKNOWLEDGES THE BILL'S DESIRE TO INCREASE SUPPLY IN TRANSIT RICH AREAS. THE CITY PASADENA KNOWLEDGES THAT THESE VERY PROVISIONS ARE WHAT THE CITY HAS BEEN DOING FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT VERY TECHNICAL ZONING TERMS. T. O. D. TRANSIT AREAS DENSITY DENSITY BONUS. FROM ARENA PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE TO EACH CITY. THE CITY OF PASADENA IS REQUIREMENTS. TOTAL THIRTEEN HUNDRED UNITS FOR THE CYCLE. WE WILL BE CLOSE TO PRODUCING SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS WE'RE DOING OUR SHARE. THIS IS NOT TO SAY WE ARE SPECIAL. BUT 87% OF THE UNITS THAT WE APPROVE OUR WITHIN TEO DE AREAS. WE ARE THE ONLY CITY IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY IT HAS A 15% REQUIRED INCLUSIONARY PERCENTAGE. WE HAVE PRODUCED OVER TWO HUNDRED UNITS A CYCLE THAT ARE AFFORDABLE DEED RESTRICTED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE HAVE EIGHT AN ORDINANCE ON THE BOOKS THAT ALLOWS HOTELS TO BE CONVERTED TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO CHANGE OUR ORDINANCES TO REFLECT THE CITY'S NEEDS THE STATE'S NEEDS THE REGION'S NEEDS WITH RESPECT TO HOUSING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS. BY TRYING TO ESTABLISH A WORKFORCE HOUSING PROVISION AND DEEPER AFFORDABILITY WE ARE JUST FINISHING OUR INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENT STUDY TO INCREASE OUR 15% TO ANOTHER NUMBER. WE ARE DEEPLY DEDICATED TO DOING THIS. WHAT THIS BILL FAILS TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT IN ORDER FOR THE CITY TO PRODUCE THE UNITS THAT I'VE DISCUSSED TO HAVE THE ZONING THE SIXTY UNITS PER ACRE IN AND AROUND ARGUE THESE? IS COMPROMISE BETWEEN RESIDENTS LOCAL GRASS ROOTS RESIDENTS FOLKS THAT WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IT'S A COMPROMISE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF PUBLIC MEETINGS AND PUBLIC TESTIMONY. BETWEEN RESIDENTS STAFF MEMBERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS THIS BILL. THAT BY ESTABLISHING ZONING NOW IT'S NOT ONE SIZE IT'S TO SIZE FITS ALL I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT THE REALITY IS IS THAT THIS WILL ALL THIS IS GOING TO WHAT CITIES WILL DO IN RESPONSE TO A BILL LIKE THIS IS TO THE STATE ASK YOU TO CONCLUDE. AND WHEN WHAT CITIES. WILL DO IS HAVE CHAOS WITH RESPECT TO THE MARK THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE GOOD PLANNING. IN THE CITY OR THE STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO TRAVEL HERE TODAY CAN ASK FOLKS WE CAN JUST PLEASE HOLD ON THE APPLAUSE THANK OU SO MUCH AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL THAT ALL OF YOUR HERE TODAY SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS RENEE MOORE M. THE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND I'M ALSO A VOLUNTEER MEMBER OF THE LOS ANGELES TENANTS UNION -- I'VE TWICE EXPERIENCED HOUSING IN SECURITY MYSELF AND HAIL FROM A COMMUNITY IN NORTHEAST LA IS EXPERIENCED SEVERE GENTRIFICATION IT'S Y. LOS ANGELES ALONG SIDE SAN FRANCISCO HAVE BOTH NOW EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS WE DO TODAY. WE OPPOSE SB FIFTY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT WILL NOT DELIVER ON THE PROMISES OF ITS SPONSORS BILL IN FACT BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IN THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. PUT DIFFERENTLY WE BELIEVE THAT SB FIFTY WILL FURTHER FUEL THE ENGINE OF GENTRIFICATION THAT IS DISPLACING WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. CONTRIBUTING TO THE CRISES OF IT SHOULDN'T AFFECT AFFORDABILITY AND TO THE SPECULATIVE FORCES THAT DRIVE BOTH WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE SB FIFTY AS A TOOL FOR THE EMPOWERMENT WORKING IN MIDDLE CLASS COMMUNITIES BUT A WEAPON. FOR THEIR FOR THEIR DISEMPOWERMENT. OUR OPPOSITION TO THE SPECIFICS OF THE BILL AS WE HAVE SO FAR FALL INTO THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. FIRST WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE AFFORDABILITY MANDATES IN THE BILL ARE ANYWHERE NEAR SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGES FACING THE STATE ALTHOUGH ALL OF KNOWLEDGE APPARENTLY THERE WILL BE MADE A MAINTENANCE ME TO THE BILL -- IN FUTURE ABOUT THAT. WORD TO MEANINGFULLY IMPACT DISAPPEAR SHORTFALL IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SB FIFTY AS DRAFTED WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY INDUCE THE NEED FOR EVEN FURTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. OR FOR TRULY AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY NEED IN OUR MAJOR CITIES. SECOND WE HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS AS DRAFTED. ON THE BILL'S TEMPORARY EXEMPTIONS FOR SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES. SB FIFTY IN EFFECT STREETS GENTRIFICATION IS INEVITABLE IT ONLY TEMPORARILY EXAMS GENTRIFYING COMMUNITIES FROM SB FIFTIES REQUIREMENTS AND IT WOULD LOCK COMMUNITIES IN TO SB FIFTY DEFAULTS. IF THEY CANNOT PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE PLANS TO AN ACT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME A FRAMEWORK THE SB FIFTY REQUIRES THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE WE ALSO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS BY HOW SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES WILL BE DETERMINED. RAISING CONCERNS OF THE FOR THE DISEMPOWERMENT OF WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SUCH AS MY OWN. THIRD. THE MUCH ANNOUNCE DEMOLITION PROTECTIONS IN SB FIFTY ARE WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE PROTECTIONS ARE PRACTICALLY ENFORCEABLE AND THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO SEE AS MEANINGFUL PROTECTIONS AT ALL. IF WE SORRY. I DON'T MEAN A RATHER WE'RE GONNA ASK YOU TO CONCLUDE OKAY. AND LIKE TO DISCLOSE WORKING TWO QUICK POINTS WE ARE PRESENTLY CONSIDERING OTHER. BILLS TO POSSIBLY SUPPORT IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. AND WE WILL BE MAKING OUR OUR POINTS ARE NOT MADE LATER ON INSOFAR AS THE ACTUALLY DO -- WHAT SB FIFTY DOES THEN WE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO EXTEND OUR SUPPORT IN? FOR THOSE BILLS I DO NOT BELIEVE THOUGH THAT WOULD BE HERE TODAY I HAVE TO SAY THAT HIS BILL HAD PROPERLY CENTER THE NEEDS OF WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLYTHOSE OF COLOR. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WHO ARE OPPOSED REMAIN HERE AND WE'RE GONNA WELCOME. TO WHO ARE IN SUPPORT WITNESSES TO PLEASE JOIN CENTER WIENER NEXT TO HIM -- SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE TURNING IT OVER TO THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION INDOOR WHO ARE IN BETWEEN.

GEN WE'D LIKE TO NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING HERE IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HAVE ANY DISCUSSION. WITH THE COMMITTEE -- AND CENTER WIENER -- THEN WE WILL -- TAKE A BRIEF BREAK IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME PAPERWORK OUT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES AFTER THE COMMITTEES ABLE TO HAVE DIALOGUE AND CONVERSATION AND THEN WILL BE ASKING. FOR A MOTION AFTER% THAT BRIEF RECESS THERE'S A GENTLEMAN OF THE COMMITTEE LET'S OPEN IT UP WE'RE GOING TO GO TO CHAIR AND THERE IT IS. MR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR DOING A GREAT JOB IN THIS HEARING AND I APOLOGIZE. TO YOU AND TO THE SENATOR WIENER FOR HAVING TO GO. JUMP UNFORTUNATELY FOR EVERYBODY ELSE'S HERE WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF HEARINGS HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS THESE WHEN WE HAVE THESE DEADLINES WE HAVE MEMBERS WHERE WERE FINAL TENUOUSLY ON DIFFERENT COMMITTEES SO I JUST WANTED. TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU AND I WANTED TO YOU KNOW LOOK. THIS IS FROM MY POINT OF VIEW AND HONEST EFFORT BY A EXCELLENT SENATOR. WAS A MAN OF INTEGRITY DO NOT THE STREETS HIS NAME BECAUSE HE'S AS IDEAS THAT MAY NOT AGREE WITH YOU BUT HE HAS THE GUTS TO TRY HIS IDEAS. I OPPOSE THOSE IDEAS BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS DELIBERATION IS ABOUT MR BOWERS IS HERE IS A MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY. AND GREAT STRENGTH IN THESE PEOPLE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. SO I JUST I WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW I I LOVE MY MOTHER BUT I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH HER. AND THAT'S THE GENIUS OF THIS PROCESS ON IT ALSO I HAVE NOT BEEN SOMEONE I REPRESENT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. AND SINCE MR. SINCE THE AUTHOR MISTER WEINER IT INTRODUCES MEASURE LAST YEAR I FELT. A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY. NOT TO BE SOMEBODY. WHO JUST SAYS I DISAGREE WITH HIS IDEA? WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THAT HE CORRECTLY NOTES HE'S RIGHT. I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE AS TO THE REASONS FOR THE PROBLEMS BUT WE CLEARLY HAVE A HOUSING ISSUE THAT AFFECTS A MULTITUDE OF FOLKS IN COMMUNITIES AND AFFORDABILITY OBJECTIFICATION AND PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS AND ALL OF THOSE ISSUES. THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE PROPER APPROACH. AND SO I STARTED LAST YEAR IN LOS ANGELES THAT I REPRESENTED A HOMEWORK I DID MY OWN HOMEWORK I SO I DON'T HAVE AN ABILITY TO JUST SAY NO. AND I ALSO PROMISED THE SENATOR IT WHICH I THINK THE HONORABLE THING TO DO BECAUSE WE WORK TOGETHER ON SO MANY MATTERS I WOULD DEMAGOGUE AGAINST HIS MEASURE WHICH I HAVE NOT DONE. MY PUBLIC POSITION IS I DID NOT SUPPORT ITS CURRENT FORM AND I DON'T SUPPORT NOW FOR MORE REASONS. SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO IT BEFORE I ASKED HIM A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WHICH IS TO SHARE SOME THINKING PUBLICLY WHICH I HAVEN'T DONE. A BECAUSE I THINK THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THIS THIS LARGER DEBATE. MY ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL FROM THE EAST SIDE OF LOS ANGELES FROM HIGHLAND PARK TO BOYLE HEIGHTS TO SOUTH LA SAID NO. WHY WHY WHAT'S GOING ON THE QUESTION IS A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE OF MENTIONS TO SOME OF THE AT THE COULD YOU COME TO MY OFFICE IS IN THE HIGH TECH BUSINESS SAID? DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE SOLUTION FALL IN LOVE WITH THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO WE GET MORE HOUSING. BECAUSE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THE BIG REASONS WHEN ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER WAS GOVERNOR I WORKED ON THIS. WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED BRADLEY BURNS WITH AS AN INCENTIVE TO BUILD BIG BOX RETAIL IN THE BILL AUTO MALLS AND WE WANTED TO REVERSE THAT WE DIDN'T WIN WE CREATE INCENTIVE TO BUILD HOUSING. THERE'S A SERIES OF REASONS WHY THAT'S THE CASE. THERE'S AS TO WHY HOUSING AS MEN BUILT IT'S NOT ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGES IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE DIAGNOSE THIS. TO UNDERSTAND IN MY VIEW THAT IT'S A LARGER S. THE LARGER ISSUE IN THAT REGARD. IN SO. I LOOKED AT AND THINK THAT WHAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS DOING IS QUITE BRILLIANT. AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT SOME. REAL ELBOW GREASE INTO IT WITH A NUMBER OF INTERNS AND STAFF IN MY OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES. WHICH BASICALLY SAYS THE GOVERNOR DID EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THAT SAYS LET'S LOOK AT STATE PROPERTY. LET'S SEE. HE'S IDENTIFIED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PIECES. OF PROPERTY. OF THAT HE'S IDENTIFIED THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY I THINK THAT ACTUALLY COULD POTENTIALLY BE THE CASE BE AVAILABLE. THE TEAM WOULD WHO WITH WHOM I HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB AND SCRUBBING THIS. WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS AN R. BETTER THAN I ACTUALLY ANTICIPATED IS THEY'RE LOOKING AT THOSE PARCELS AND SAYING OKAY WHICH ONES REALLY AREN'T AVAILABLE? WHICH ONES DO WORK FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS THAT ARE ENCUMBERED FOR OTHER RASONS THEY'RE ALSO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS THROUGH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY CALIFORNIA LEGAL CITIES. ASKING CITIES AND COUNTIES TO SAY CAN WE HARSH TRADE OTHER PROPERTIES THAT COULD BE GOOD FOR HOUSING THAT WOULD WORK FOR FOLKS. BOMB THAT WE COULD TRADE WITH YOU AND I'M TOLD THAT IN LAKE COUNTY THERE'S A MILITARY SURPLUS PROPERTY IT'S BEING DISCUSSED I'M TOLD THAT THERE'S A SIMILAR PROPERTY IN SANTA CRUZ. I'VE MADE SIMILAR REQUESTS FOR PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IT'S NOT YOU KNOW AND THE IDEA BEHIND WITH THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO DO. IS THAT IF WE CAN IDENTIFY THIS PROPERTY WHATEVER IT IS WE CAN A SINCE WE OWN IT WE CAN LEASE IT FOR A DOLLAR A YEAR SO LITTLE AMOUNT OF MONEY. WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDER THIS PROPOSAL IS WE'RE GONNA INCREASE LAND COSTS MY SIGNIFICANT OTHERS PARENTS LIVE IN A HOUSE IN HOLLYWOOD. AND THEY PAID. TAX DOLLARS AND NOW THEY WANT TWENTY X. BECAUSE IT'S GOT APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND MOS LIKELY WANT TO TEAR IT DOWN WITH AN APARTMENT BUILDINGS. AND SO THEY'LL MAKE A WINDFALL THAT'S GREAT BUT DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF MONEY IF YOU CAN REDUCE LAND COSTS HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THREE THINGS ONE REDUCE LAND COSTS. IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO THIS ACROSS THE STATE FOR VERY FEW DOLLARS ALL OF A SUDDEN DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE ISSUE. TOO IF YOU COULD EXPEDITE AS UPSET AS BEFORE DOES TO SOME EXTENT THE APPROVAL PROCESS ON THOSE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED STATE PROPERTIES. YOU DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE SPEED ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES THAT I'VE BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH IT IS I'VE GOING THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES THAT I REPRESENT TALKING HOMEOWNERS. WERE OUT THERE WRITING A CHECK FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE ALL THE MAYORS ARE SAYING WE WANT MONEY FOR PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESSNESS. I BRING THEM IN THE OFFICE HOW MANY BILLS THEY'RE COMING IN ASKING FOR THE CHECK THIS YEAR WHAT HAVE YOU DONE I'M SORRY. YOU IN IN IN CITIES ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA COUNTIES YOU APPROVED ALL SORTS OF MONEY WHAT HAS BEEN PRODUCED PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED THEY'RE ANGRY DELIVERABLE TIMES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO SAY WE HAVE A POLICY. WE'VE GOT TO DO IT INSTANTANEOUSLY THESE AMENDMENTS I SAW TALK ABOUT FACTORS RELATING. TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIRD WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED THAT PROVIDE CAPITAL CAPITAL SPEED OF APPROVAL. SHE PLAN COSTS I WOULD ADD IN BECAUSE IT'S MY POLITICS I WANT PREVAILING WAGE ON ALL THOSE PROPERTIES BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE EARN A FAIR WAGE THAT'S MY POLITICS. SO BOTTOM LINE IS. THE WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S WORKING ON AND I'VE TALKED TO THE PEOPLE IN A VERY IMPRESSED BY THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE WORKING SO IF IT IN TERMS OF THE DELIVERABLE OF HOW DO WE BUILD FOUR MILLION UNITS. HOW DO WE MAKE THIS STUFF HAPPEN ASQUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING COSTS THE ISSUE OBJECTIFICATION AFFORDABILITY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO COST BY CAN BUILD THE PLACE TO COST ME FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS? I CAN'T RENTED FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IF I CAN BUILD A PLACE TO COST FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I CAN RENT IT FOR LESS MONEY. SO YOU HAVE TO TREAD TRY TO DO THAT AND WHILE THIS IS AN INTERESTING APPROACH AND I LOOK AT THESE GUYS HAVE WORKED THEIR HEARTS OUT -- THE ONLY OTHER THINGS I WANT TO SHARE IS WHAT WE'VE DONE AND I'VE SEEN THIS IN POLITICS I WAS ON THE PAYROLL IN THIS PLACE ONE MILE REAGAN WAS GOVERNOR. BROWN A LONG TIME AND SEEN A LOT OF STUFF I DON'T KNOW IF I'M RIGHT I JUST HAVE GOTTEN THE GUTS TO ASK QUESTIONS. AND WHAT I LOOK AT HERE IS. THIS IS ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET A MEASURE THROUGH BUT WHAT WE'RE WE HAVE WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WE NOW HAVE THIS AND MERGE APPROACHES AS WELL FORTY THREE COUNTIES HAVE. ONE FORTY FIVE COUNTIES HAVE ONE RULE. THE FORTY FORTY THREE COUNTY SOMEONE RULES AND FIFTEEN COUNTIES OF ANOTHER RULE BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER THAN. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AT LEAST I MAY BE WRONG ON THIS BUT MY READING OF EXEMPTION OF COASTAL ZONES MEANING THAT THIS THIS RULE DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CITY OF DEL MAR WHICH IS APPLIED TO THE CITY OF MALIBU. IS THAT JUSTICE IS THAT RIGHT CERTAINLY IT BEARS A QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE EXEMPTION OF COASTAL ZONES. YOU KNOW CERTAIN THE BUS ROUTES ARE ISSUES THE CHALLENGE ME BECAUSE WE'RE BASICALLY TRANSFERRING LAND USE POLICIES TO THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. OF WHAT THEY DO I KNOW SOME OF THE CORRECTIONS BUT I ONLY GOT THIS EIGHT FORTY FIVE THIS MORE EIGHT FIFTEEN THIS MORNING. AND I HAD A CONVERSATION GOOD CONVERSATION WITH THE GREAT CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON IT. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS. YOU KNOW. I AM I AM NOT SUPPORTING THIS BY ANY STRETCH IMAGINATION I HAVE HELD QUIET BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS RESPECTFUL TO MY COLLEAGUES. IT IN WORKING AN INSTITUTION LIKE THIS THIS IS HOW I WORK. I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO DEMAGOGUE AGAINST YOUR COLLEAGUES IT'S IT'S STAND UP FOR ISSUES BUT I JUST LOOK AT HOW THIS APPROACHES AND I SE THAT IS FROM MY POINT OF VIEW A COBBLING TOGETHER OF A NUMBER OF INTERESTS -- THAT DON'T REALLY GET TO THE POINT THAT I TALK ABOUT IN THAT THAT THE THIS. A HIGH TECH PERSON SAYS FALL IN LOVE WITH THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION. AND WE HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE SOLUTION AND TRY TO RE JIGGER IT SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T WHAT WE HAVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE ON THE TABLE IS THERE SOME MEMBERS THAT HAVE ABILITY. TO MOVE THE PROCESS QUICKLY WITH THE GOVERNOR IS DOING IS ELEGANT. ELEGANT AND SO TO ME BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HOW TO GET THINGS DONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WOULD BE -- TO UTILIZE THAT AND THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS OF COURSE THAT'S NOT A BIG ENOUGH SOLUTION. MR WE I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT BUT THE IDEA OF AND I'M NOT A BIG FAN IWAS CHAIRMAN THIS COMMITTEE WAS SAID I AND AND THE PEOPLE HAVE LEGAL CITIES KNOW THAT I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK THEY DO A LOT OF STUFF THAT'S WRONG A LOT OF TIMES. BUT BUT THAT'S NOT IT. THE QUESTION IS THROWING OUT THE ZONING IN MY CITY AS YOU KNOW FROM CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD A MISTER WINNER IT IS THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION -- IN LOS ANGELES HAS AGREED BAY CITY -- AND CERTAINLY THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT BUT BROUGHT MORE BROADLY SPEAKING I'M I THINK NOT JUST ABOUT THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH IS I REPRESENT WITH EVERY BONE IN MY BODY. BUT ALSO THE REST OF THE CITY THAT I HAVE HAD GREAT EPERIENCE WITH ALL AROUND THE PLACE AND THE COUNTY. AND SO YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT WHY WHY THESE FOLKS HAVE DONE WHAT THEY'VE DONE AND WHAT THEY SAID. YEAH IT'S A TORTILLA OVER LOCAL JURISDICTION YOUR NO QUESTION SIR THE QUESTION BUT I I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A LARGER DYNAMIC HERE THAT I DON'T THINK. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE SOLUTION AND I THINK THAT WE'VE CREATED SO MANY MORE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO THIS APPROACH. ON THAT WE NEED TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD BUT CONTINUE TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND I WILL CONTINUE SERVER EASIER JUST ABOUT CLOSEST TO THE HARDEST WORKING PERSON. I THINK HE IS THE HARDEST WORKING PERSON YOUR NUMBER -- TWO IN THIS BUILDING AND TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU IN THAT REGARD BUT I WANT TO SHARE MY THINKING AFTER I GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ ALL THIS STUFF. AND HAPPY TO HEAR ANY OTHER RESPONSES BUT IT HAS BEEN A A LOT OF HOMEWORK FOR ME AND IT'S BEEN A LOT A LOT OF TIME. AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING ON THIS IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED UNITS ON THE ORANGE LINE THAT WE PUT IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SO WE HAVE RESPONDED IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY TO TRANCE OR IN DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MORE UNITS UNDER CONSERVATIVE PERMIT IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THE BIGGEST SINCE WE'VE HAD SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE SO CORRECT WE HAVE A PROBLEM. CORRECT IT'S A BIG DEAL GIGANTIC LEE IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE RAISED EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION BY VIRTUE WHAT YOU'VE DONE YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO THE FOREFRONT AND YOU DESERVE GREAT CREDIT FOR THAT. NOW LET'S QUIT LET'S SAY HOW DO WE MARCH FORWARD AND THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE SIR. HE SO MUCH AS A MAJORITY LEADER WE'RE GONNA HAVE CENTER WIENER BE ABLE TO RESPOND THEN WE'D LIKE YOU TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR CENTER WIENER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU -- CENTER HEARD FOR FOR THOSE COMMENTS. TO BE VERY CLEAR ON THE ONLY THE ONLY. TIME I FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYTHING IS WITH -- FAMILY AND FRIENDS I DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH PROBLEMS OR SOLUTIONS THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS PROBLEM THIS IS A TOXIC PROBLEM THAT IS DEBILITATING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR ENVIRONMENT. OUR ECONOMY THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE IS PUSHING PEOPLE OUT. IS PUSHING PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW IN YOUR DISTRICT SENATOR AND MY DISTRICT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COMMUTING. TWO PLUS HOURS EACH WAY EVERY DAY TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE YOUR CITY AND MY CITY HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING SO THOSE WORKERS CAN ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE CITY AND THERE'S TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY ON THE ROAD. SPEWING CARBON INTO THE AIR **** UP THEIR BACKS. 60% OF THE PEOPLE THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THAT LIVE IN THE VALLEY WORK IN THE VALLEY WE'VE CHANGE THAT AROUND IT'S IT'S OUR ASSUMPTION THAT'S WRONG WITH ALL WITH ALL RESPECT WE HAVE A HUGE IN COMMUTES BOTH IN THE LA AND INTO THE BAY AREA. AND IT IS CAUSING REAL DAMAGE SO IS A PROBLEM THAT I WILL NEVER FALL IN LOVE WITH BUT IT IS A PROBLEM THAT WE DO IF THE TECHS AND I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH ANY PARTICULAR SOLUTION. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE A THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME DEFICIT IN CALIFORNIA? AND THAT WE RANK FORTY NINE OUT OF FIFTY IN HOMES FOR CAPITAL THOSE NUMBERS DON'T LIE THAT'S NOT ABOUT SURPLUS PROPERTY THAT ISABEL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING HOW WE DO HOUSING TO SAY HOW DO WE DIG OUT OF THE THREE POINT. FIVE MILLION HOME HOLE I AM A OF THE GOVERNOR SURPLUS PROPERTY PLAN THERE'S A SURPLUS PROPERTY BILL THE CENTRE BELL TALKED ABOUT THE IS OUGHT THE TWO SENATORS ARE AUTHORING THE LEGISLATURE I AM ALL ABOUT. TAKING OUR SURPLUS PROPERTY IN TURNING INTO 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT'S NOT GOING TO DIG US OUT OF A THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOLE AND IT WILL NOT. HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHETHER IT'S AN SURPLUS PROPERTY -- ELSEWHERE WE'RE BUILDING FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AS WE SHOULD. IF WE'RE GOING TO HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS IT'S ABOUT INCREASING THE SUPPLY. OVERALL AND THEN FINALLY I WANTED TO SAY I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE TAX INCENTIVES THEY'RE ALL WRONG AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR TRYING TO FIX SOME ASPECTS OF A BROKEN TAX SYSTEM. AND WE DO NEED TO STREAMLINE HOUSING APPROVALS THANK YOU FOR VOTING FOR SB. THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY STREAMLINING LOW INCOME HOUSING ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER WINNER WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE VICE CHAIR AND I I NEGLECTED TO SAY EARLIER AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU THE VICE CHAIR. VICE CHAIR DOES AN AMAZING JOB -- ON BEHALF OF THE STATE HE WAS AT EVERY HOUSING HEARING THAT WE'VE HAD UP AND DOWN AT THIS GREAT STATE I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. CENTER MORE LOCK IN THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR YOU MISTER CARE. WIENER JUST FOR QUICK QUESTIONS BUT MAYBE LONG ANSWER. IN THE LIKELY MICROPHONE. OKAY YES YOU SEE ME. I CAN SEE YOU AND HEAR YOU. FIRST QUESTION IS DO I JUST ONE WORD GENTRIFICATION. YOU JUST RESPOND SURE ABSOLUTELY ON GENTRIFICATION OR DISPLACEMENT. WE ARE IS SOMETHING PERSONAL I YOU KNOW. I LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND I I LIVE IN THE CASTRO WHICH HAS BEEN PROFOUNDLY IMPACTED. BY GENTRIFICATION DISPLACEMENT I LIVE ABOUT. FOUR BLOCKS FROM THE MISSION -- WHICH HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLY IMPACTED. BY GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT. AND THESE NEIGHBORHOODS EXPERIENCED DISPLACEMENT GENTRIFICATION OVER A PERIOD AS A MATTER AS WITH MANY OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS. OVER A PERIOD OF DECADES WHERE WE WERE BUILDING VERY LITTLE NEW HOUSING. DISPLACEMENT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE GET PUSHED OUT BECAUSE HOUSING COSTS GO THROUGH THE ROOF. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE EOUGH HOUSING AND WE DON'T HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH TENER PROTECTIONS WHICH WE ALSO NEED TO DO THIS YEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE -- AND SO WE HAVE BUILT VERY STRONG ANTI DISPLAYS FROM PROTECTIONS INTO THIS BILL THE STRONGER SAID EXIST UNDER STATE LAW -- IF THE TENANT HAS RESIDED ON A PROPERTY AT ANY POINT IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. THE NOT BUILDING COULD NOT BE TORN DOWN TO BUILD IN SB FIFTY PROJECT EVEN IF THE LOCAL CITY GOVERNMENT WOULD ALLOW IT. IF THERE'S BEEN AN ALLIS ACTIVATION THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS YOU CAN'T USE THIS BILL. ARE WE NEGOTIATED THESE PROVISIONS WITH. THE EQUITY COALITION BEEN HEARD FROM BEFORE WHICH IS STILL WORKING WITH US. AND I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO MAKING SURE NOT TO PLACING PEOPLE THIS IS ABOUT ADDING NEW HOUSING NOT REPLACING RESIDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY EXISTING -- ALREADY RESIDING IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. SECOND QUESTION IS ADDING. RENTAL UNITS OR APARTMENTS ADJACENT TO ARE DIRECTLY IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN. DRAWBRIDGE AREAS THAT SEEMS TO BE THE BIGGEST. CONCERN I'M GETTING FROM MY CONSTITUENTS TO JUST. EXPLAIN WHAT. THAT MEANS SO THAT ONLY A PERSON CAN APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING ABSOLUTELY ONE THING IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND -- IS THAT -- AND THIS IS OF COURSE OUR SECOND TIME AT THE RODEO ON ON THIS BILL WE WANT TO WE DID SB TWO SEVEN LAST YEAR. AND WE GOT A LOT OF CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT THAT BILL I AM ON FROM FOLKS WHO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT -- INTENSIFICATION IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD FOLKS CONCERNED ABOUT DISPLACEMENT SO FORTH. ON AND WE TOOK ALL THAT COULD BE BACK TO HER AND WE MADE CHANGES TO THE BILL. THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF SB. TWO SEVEN AROUND BUS STOPS TRIGGERED A HEIGHT INCREASE ABOVE LOCAL HEIGHT LIMITS. WE THEN IN THE NEW VERSION OF THE BILL. BOTH ARE IN THE JOBS RICH CLASSIFICATION AT AROUND BUS STOPS. THE LOCAL HEIGHT LIMIT IS RESPECTED SO IN THE JOB RICH AREAS THE LOCAL HEIGHT LIMIT APPLIES LOCAL SETBACK RULES APPLY. LOCAL DESIGN STANDARDS APPLY LOCAL DEMOLITION RULES. APPLY LOCAL INCLUSIONARY APPLIES LOCAL IMPACT FEES. APPLY AND SO FOR THE MOST PART THE LOCAL CRUCIAL PROCESS APPLIES. SO FOR THE MOST PART LOCAL RULES WILL STILL APPLY. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS BILL DOES NOT TRIGGER A HIGH INCREASE -- IT DIFFERS TO LOCAL HEARTS SO YES IT WILL ALLOW THESE SMALL MULTI UNIT BUILDINGS BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT PUTTING YOU KNOW SKYSCRAPERS AND MEMBERS THE OTHER THING I WILL SAY IS. AND THIS DIFFERENT PEOPLE TAKE THIS DIFFERENTLY -- I THINK SOMETIMES. PEOPLE I WHEN I LISTEN TO TO SOME PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE BILL IT'S AS IF THE GOVERNOR SIGNS THE BILL IF YOU KNOW IF THAT HAPPENS IF WE GET THERE. HE SIGNS IT AND THE NEXT DAY APARTMENT BUILDING START DSCENDING FROM THE SKY IN THE PEOPLE'S NEIGHBORHOODS WELL THAT'S NOT HELD A BILL IN THE WORKS DEVELOPMENT IS SLOW EVEN WHEN YOU'RE IN A IN A PROCESS OR IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS FAVORABLE. AND SO THIS IS GOING TO GIVE THEMAN AVAILABLE PARCEL DEVELOPER WHO IS FUNDING GO THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS AND FRANKLY DECADES -- TO SEE REALLY REALLY SIGNIFICANT. ANY KIND OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES A VERY GRADUAL THING OVER TIME. THE THIRD QUESTION IS A STUDY. I MENTIONED A FEW TIMES YOU'RE DOING THIS WITHOUT A STUDY WOULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT THERE HAVE BEEN. MORE STUDIES ABOUT HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEN WE COULD PROBABLY FIT IN THIS ROOM IF WE STOCKTON FROM FLOOR TO CEILING. STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN AS I MENTIONED THE THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOME DEFICIT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT RESTRICTIVE ZONING IN CALIFORNIA PLACES A VERY HARSH COP ON OUR ABILITY. TO CLOSE THAT -- BACK OUT OF STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT RESTRICTIVE ZONING LEADS TO SPRAWL SO THAT MORE MORE HOUSING GETS PUSHED INTO FARMLANDS -- AND FAR FAR AWAY CLOGGING UPPER FREEWAYS -- STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT RESTRICTIVE ZONING MAKES COMMUNITIES LESS DIVERSE BECAUSE IT BANS AFFORDABLE HOUSING ABOUNDS APARTMENT BUILDINGS WE HAVE. MORE STUDIES NO WE COULD EVER NEED -- WE HAVE ALL THE DATA WE NEED AND NOW WHICH IS IN THE POLITICAL WILL TO EXECUTE ON THE SOLUTION. LAST QUESTION IS -- THE CITY OF PASADENA SAID WE HAVE BEEN DOING. X. Y. Z. AND THEREFORE WE YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE REBELLING ABOUT. WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING WE MAY SUE? I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE'S A A PROVISION THAT SAYS. THANK YOU FOR PRIOR EFFORTS. YOU'VE MET THE CRITERIA WE HAVE YOU JUST RESPONSE IT FOR ANYONE TO FILE A LAWSUIT WE KNOW THE HUNTINGTON BEACH IS ALREADY SUING THE STATE REPEATEDLY TRYING TO OVERTURN THE SB THIRTY FIVE THAT I AUTHORED TWO YEARS AGO. THERE HOUSING IS AN ISSUE STATEWIDE CONCERN AND SO I I DON'T BELIEVE THE LAWSUIT HAMMER BUT ANYONE COMPILERS SUIT. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF WHAT PASADENA SAID AND I APPLAUD ANY CITY IN THERE ARE PLENTY OF CITIES THAT ARE AT THEIR CITIES THAT ARE REALLY MAKING GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO BUILD HOUSING. I THINK THAT SOMETIMES IN THESE HOUSING THE BATES -- WE ARE QUICKLY PEOPLE START DEMONIZING LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS -- AND I KNOW MANY MANY CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND OVERWHELMINGLY THESE ARE. GOOD HARD WORKING COMMITTED PEOPLE RUN FOR OFFICE FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS AND THEY WANT TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY GET PAID VERY LITTLE AND THEY GET YELLED OUT AT THE SUPERMARKET AND IT'S YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE MOST FUN JOB IN THE WORLD BUT THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY'RE COMMITTED -- BUT WE HAVE CREATED A SYSTEM THAT HAS SET CITIES OUGHT TO FAIL BOTH FIRST TAXES STRUCTURE REASONS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE SET ME VERY FEW STATE RULES IN THE ONCE WE SET OUR UNENFORCEABLE AND WE EXPECT CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS TO WALK THE PLANK EVERY WEEK VOTE FOR PROJECTS.% AND RISK THEIR OWN POLITICAL FUTURE. ON THIS IS NOT WHAT WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF THE BAD ACTORS CITIES AND THE GOOD ACTORS CITIES. AND YOU PUT THE HOUSING IN THE IN THE NAUGHTY BAD ACTORS CITIES AND FOR THE GOOD ACTORS CITIES THEY GOT A BENEFIT OF NO HOUSING -- WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION THAT HOUSING IS SOME SOME HELP PUNISHMENT. RIGHT WE'RE GONNA IF YOU'RE BAD AND AUDIENCES CITY WERE GOING TO PUNISH YOU WITH MORE HOUSING AND IF YOU'RE GOOD WE'RE GOING TO REWARD YOU BY NOT HAVING. MORE HOUSING THERE. I HOUSING IS A BENEFIT. AND WHAT BIG PICTURE WE HAVE THIS MASSIVE HOUSING DEFICIT AND THE QUESTION IS NOT WHO'S BEEN GOOD WHO'S BEEN BAD. BUT TO ADD THESE HOMES THAT WE NEED WHERE DO WE NEED TO PUT THEM TO BE SUSTAINABLE NEAR JOBS YOU'RE TRANSIT -- SO THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT IT -- A AND AYE AYE THAT'S TO BE THE BEST APPROACH THANK YOU MISTER CENTER WINNER JUST AS CALIFORNIA QUESTIONS AS YOU FINISH OKAY I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK IF -- I MISS MISS GARCIA AND HIS SIBLINGS THING THING IF IF YOU HAD. MAYBE. ONE MINUTE EACH JUST TO RESPOND. TO THE SENATOR. APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ABOUT THE STUDIES SO. REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US AND DO WE KNOW WHETHER THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US IS REALLY THE RIGHT. ROUTE TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE NEED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE MAY BE NUMEROUS STUDIES BUT HAS ANYONE LOOKED AT THIS PARTICULAR BILL AT THE PARTICULAR PROVISIONS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE THAT ARE AT THE TABLE. TO SAY THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH THAT SAID HE HAS NOT BEEN DONE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE IN -- I WANT TO SAY -- IN REGARDS THE DEMOLITION PROVISIONS I'M GLAD CENTER WIENER IS STARTING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THE PROBLEM OF DEMOLITIONS IN CALIFORNIA BUT I HAVE TO SAY IS A TENANT ADVOCATE -- THAT WE SEE DEMOLITION AS A BRAMPTON ISSUE EVEN IN PLACES FROM PLATE LOS ANGELES WHICH LOSES FIVE AND A HALF RENT CONTROLLED UNITS A DAY. LARGELY DUE TO DEMOLITION -- EVEN IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HAS RELATIVELY STRONG DEMOLITION PROTECTIONS I IN MY PRIVATE CAPACITY WAS JUST ORGANIZING WITH A BUNCH OF TENANTS HIS ENTIRE BUILDING WAS DE CONTROLLED -- BECAUSE OF RENOVATIONS WE SEE RENT EVICTIONS BASICALLY LIKE EVICTION SLASH RENOVATION AS A PRETEXT TO GET LOW INCOME TENANTS IS IN OUT OUT OF HOUSING -- AND SO WHILE THE ELLIS ACT INTENDANT EXEMPTION PROVISIONS LOOK EXCELLENT ON PAPER THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE -- AND THE OWNERS WOULD STILL LARGELY BE ON TEN ORGANIZATIONS OUT WHICH IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW LIKE TEN ORGANIZATIONS WERE UNDERFUNDED UNDER RESOURCE THE COMMUNITIES THAT THE SATURDAYS EASTER BASIN ARE THE ONES FIGHTING THE DISPLACEMENT OF ACTION THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY'RE FIGHTING THESE DEMOLITIONS. AND WHAT THIS PROVISION DOESN'T REALLY CHANGES THE FACT THAT BY THAT TIME THE THE BOTH THE SHIP IS ALREADY SAILED. THE TRAINS ROLLED OUT OF THE STATION WE'RE THERE IS ALREADY A DEMOLITION OR AND ALICE ACTIVATION OR SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED. I STILL HAVE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS PROVISION IS GOING TO AFFECT OUR PENALIZES LIKE IS IT GOING TO BE AN ASK FOR YOU KNOW FORGIVENESS NOT FOR PERMISSION SITUATION. FOR SOMEONE WHO IS INCENTIVIZE TO DEMOLISH EXISTING RENTAL HOUSING AND REDEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THANK YOU SO MISTER MAJORITY LEADER FOR SOURCE I JUST WANT TO BUILD ON YOUR POINT THAT YOU MADE EXACTLY WHAT -- CENTER MORLOCK SAID WAS THIS NOTION OF A STUDY -- AND AGAIN I'M NOT. YOU'RE EXACTLY CORRECT THE CENTER WIENER THAT WE'VE SEEN IS NOT STUDIES TO FILL THIS ROOM I PROBABLY READ QUARTER OF SOME -- BUT THAT IS THE QUESTION A STUDY GIVEN HOW BIG THIS IS HOW BIG THIS ENDEAVOR IS. IF YOU LITERALLY THIS GETS ENACTED IT WON'T BE THE LAW TO JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY OKAY. IF WE COULD CREATE A SITUATION SAYS LET'S LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR OF WHAT THESE DO BECAUSE I LITERACY SECONDS I LITERALLY TALK TALK TO SOMEBODY TOLD ME. THAT THE TEN MINUTE THING ON THE BUS DEAL MASS NO IMPACT IN MY CITY. ZERO THAT'S UNTRUE I I DIDN'T SEE IT'S NOT CHOICES I WAS TOLD THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU STUDY TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT. SO THE POINT IS THAT. THAT THAT THE THE IDEA IS ON IF YOU DID THIS AND THEN PUT IN THE TRAILER BILL IN JUNE IN JUNE OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR YOU'RE DELAYING IT BY SIX MONTHS. BUT WHAT YOU'RE IN THE MEANTIME THE GOVERNOR MOVES QUICKLY ON ON IS A PROPERTY STUFF YOU COULD BUILD A TON OF STUFF PROBABLY FIFTY THOUSAND UNITS I'M GUESSING JUST HERTZBERG OFFICE HAD. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS IT STARTS YOUR BILL IS NOT GOING TO BUILD A THING. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS GIVES US COMFORT THAT THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS ACCURATE WELL AS I WAS FIND CHALLENGING IN THIS AND MY OWN BILLS. YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MISTAKES I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN WE YOU COME IN AND YOU SAY I WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU DOESN'T. WORK THE WAY YOU WANT TO WORK. SOMETHING THIS BIG CAN YOU TAKE AN EXTRA SIX MONTHS AND SAY OKAY LET'S PUT THIS BILL. THE EXACT LANGUAGE INTO A STUDY WITH THE SUPER COMMISSION WHOEVER GETS APPOINTED AND LOOK AT THE HARD HOMEWORK AND IF IT WORKS PUT THE TRAILER BILL IN JUNE YOU'VE GOT A SIX MONTH DELAY BUT YOU REALLY HAVE. THE WHOLE WORK THAT'S DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE RIGHT AS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. NGUYEN M. A CENTER I I APPRECIATE THAT BUT FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE THIS BILL IN ITS. TWO DIFFERENT FORMS HAS BEEN AROUND NOW FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS WHICH TALKS INTRODUCED AROUND FOR A LONG TIME -- THERE HAVE BEEN SPECIFIC STUDIES AND ANALYSIS ON THIS BILL VARIOUS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THEM TOO SO NOT ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THE BILL HAS BEEN STUDIED. IN DEPTH AND WE CAN PROVIDE THAT -- TO YOU -- AND I DON'T THINK AN EXTRA SIX MONTHS IS GOING. TO DO ANYTHING BODY BUT IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME IT'S BEEN STUDIED AND BEDDED -- AD NAUSEAM IN A GOOD WAY SEC YES IT'S GOOD THAT IT'S BEEN -- BETTER AND STARTED SO THAT'S HAPPENED ALREADY. I JUST GOT THE AMENDMENTS WHICH EMERGES AS PEOPLE WITH SB FIFTY AT EIGHT FIFTEEN THIS MORNING WHICH I GOT A CHANCE TO LOOK TO AND THEN HANDED HERE AGAIN. MERGE INTO ONE DOCUMENT AT EIGHT TWENTY FOUR SO WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE NOW TAKING THESE TWO MEASURES YOURS DIDN'T WASN'T SB FOR YOURS SB FIFTY IS THAT RIGHT K.. I'VE TAKEN MOMENTS TO SB FIFTY THIS IN THE SAME WAY THAT. WE ALL TAKE AMENDMENTS IN COMMITTEE AND IT'S VERY COMMON THAT ANALYSIS COMES OUT TRULY BEFORE HEARING ESPECIALLY WHEN IN NEGOTIATIONS HAVING SO THERE'S NOTHING UNTOWARD ABOUT THAT AND YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN I DO BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN I'VE BEEN HERE. ALAN JESTING IS WHEN YOU SAID THIS IS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME YOU'VE TAKEN ENTIRE OTHER BILL EMERGED IN. MAYBE IT IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT A WE MADE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AND THE BILL IF THINGS GO WELL THE BILL WILL HAVE UP TO FOUR MORE HEARINGS IF IF IT KEEPS GOING -- FOR MORE HEARINGS THIS LANGUAGE WILL BE IMPRINT WILL DO WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE WHICH IS MEET WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MEET IDEA YEAH I'VE MET WITH A LOT OF MAYORS AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS EQUITY GROUPS -- ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE TO RECEIVE OUR MENTALIST PEOPLE TO RECEIVE FEEDBACK ON THE BILL I STAFF HAS AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WORK AND I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN LA. ON THIS BILL AND I'VE CORRESPONDED WITH A NUMBER OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT [inaudible] CENTRE BELL [inaudible] GERMAN GNOME. AS YOU KNOW -- COMPLICATED PROCESS INVOLVEDCOMPLICATED ISSUES SO. WE'RE WE'RE NOW IN A PROCESS IN MY OPINION. TO FORM OF COCKETT. AND I LOOK AT THIS BILL IS ONE PART OF THE PACKAGE AND I WANT TO STATE AGAIN. DOT IF THE PACKAGE MOVES FORWARD I'M FULLY SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. PACKAGE DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD. I'M NOT SUPPORTIVE OF ANY ELEMENT OF THE PACKAGE WITHOUT ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS. SO IF BOB AND I WANT TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID ABOUT [inaudible] THANK. SB FOUR NSP FIFTY IS PART OF THE PACKAGE THAT'S GOING TO EVOLVE INTO A BILL. THAT WILL DEAL WITH STREAMLINING -- OF PROPS ENCOURAGING -- PROPER -- DEVELOPMENT AROUND TRANSIT. AND MORE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES I HOPE THAT'S WHAT THE GOAL IS. I THINK THE GOAL SHOULD BE INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY THERE INCLUDES -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PEOPLE OF ALL INCOME MALES IN A DIVERSE COMMUNITY THAT LIVE AROUND THAT TRANSIT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO INSIST ON SB FIVE WOULD PROVIDE THE FINANCING AND OTHER BILLS -- WE'LL SEE WHAT THE GOVERNOR DOES IN HIS BUDGET AND I'M GONNA TELL GOVERNOR. THAT WE CANNOT HAVE A PACKAGE ON HOUSING LEGISLATION UNLESS THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IF THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT GOAL IF YOU JUST CONTINUES WITH THE ONE TIME ONLY SOURCE OF FUNDS. THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE IF WE DO THESE KINDS OF BILLS. NOT APPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT THE CORRECT THING TO DO -- I SUPPORT SB SIX AND THAT'S INCLUDING AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING GOOD SCIENCE FROM THE GOVERNOR THAT WE'RE GONNA IDENTIFIED LAN. AND PERHAPS RATHER THAN DISPLACING. HOUSING WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE GOD WITH THE HELP OF NEIGHBORHOODS. VACANT -- PARKING LOTS A LONG STRIP COMMERCIAL AREAS THAT ARE VACANT. UNDER UTILIZED PROPERTY AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT WHERE THERE'S A APARTMENT COMPLEX. THAT WE WOULD HAVE A LOT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE DON'T WANT TO RIP DOWN THE APARTMENT COMPLEX. AS OPPOSED TO BUILDING ON DOWN THE BLOCK A VACANT PIECE OF PROPERTY. AND THAT WOULD TAKE HELP. AND ASSISTANCE FROM THE COMMUNITY. AND THE PLANNING DEPARTMENTS OF THE CITIES ARE SO IMPORTANT TO MAKE IN THAT WORK THE PLANE DEPARTMENTS DAVID REYES TALKED ABOUT IT FROM PASADENA. THE THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. WE HAVE TO HAVE GOOD PLANNING. GOOD PLANNING HOUSE TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS. WE DON'T HVE GOOD PLANNING. OF LONG TERM -- NONE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO WE HAVE TO SUPPORT GOOD PLANNING AND THIS IS A LONG TERM ISSUE -- WE ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC OF FISCAL ZONING. YOU KNOW THE PLAN DEPARTMENT WORKS FOR THE CITY MANAGER. CITY MANAGERS AND THE CITY -- IT MINISTRATIONS. ARE LOOKING AT YOUR BUDGET EVERY YEAR AND THEY WANT LAND USES THAT. THE GENERATE TAX INCOME. TAX INCOME OR OR REVENUE GENERATED OF LAND USE POLICIES THAT. THAT ARE NOT IN WRITING BUT ACTUALLY ARE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE. GENERATING A LOT OF JOBS IN TAX REVENUE AS OPPOSED TO JAY IT'S A HOUSING PROJECT AS AFFORDABLE. THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE. INAPPROPRIATE FROM A MORAL STANDPOINT. AND AND I THINK FROM THE LONG TERM STATE FISCAL STANDPOINT FOR OUR COMMUNITY WE HAVE TO HAVE PRIORITIES SET STRAIGHT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS TO PRIORITY NOT THOSE LAND USES A CREATE A LOT OF JOBS WITHOUT HOUSING IS THEY JUST MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE. ME AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO STATE TENET PROTECTIONS AND DISPLACED ANTI DISPLACEMENT LAWS. IN THE SENATE PACKAGE I DON'T SEE THOSE KINDS OF PROPOSALS AS MUCH WE HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES ON THEIR BILLS. AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BILLS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND NAM SUPPORT THOSE TENANTS -- DISPLACEMENTS TENSE RIGHTS BILLS RENT CONTROL BILLS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THAT. AS A SOLUTION TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I SEE THIS IS A PACKAGE MISTER GERMAN -- I WANT TO INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY IN THE IN THE CONCEPT OF A PACKAGE. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE A PACKAGE OF THIS BILL IN THE OTHER BILLS. OF I DON'T THINK IT'S A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT THIS YEAR'S SO. TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE TO INSIST ON A PACKAGE. IF THERE'S NOT A PACKAGE OF WILL CONTINUE HAVE CONFLICTS. AND WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO CREATE A PACKAGE AND I I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ALL SIDES ON THE QUESTION. ON THIS ISSUE AND PULL EVERYBODY TOGETHER WITH EVERYBODY'S ASSISTANCE. AND I HOPE THE REST OF YOU AGREE WITH THAT I'M I'M -- COMMITTED. AND WE CAN WE CAN DO THIS WE CAN'T CREATE A A GOOD -- PACKAGE INVOLVING ALL THESE ELEMENTS THAT I MENTIONED. AND I I ACTUALLY I I FEEL I PROBABLY MISS ON TOM AND THE REASON I PROBABLY MISSED SOME IS BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE IDEAS FROM EVERYBODY ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT THING -- WE SHOULD NOT USE CONFLICTING STATEMENTS ON ON EACH OTHER. I HOPE THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T -- CREATE ANTAGONISTIC STATEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT I THINK WE OUGHT TO WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO WORK TOGETHER WE HAVE. TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER. AND NOW IT TAKES -- A LOT OF EFFORT -- TO TO DO THAT AND YOU KNOW THE SENATE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WE WE ARE VERY RESPECTFUL OF OUR COLLEAGUES EVEN IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE AND I THINK. ON THIS ISSUE -- I I SEE A LOT OF ALBUMS IN WE HAVE TO KIND OF RESPECT ONE ANOTHER FOR GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO. IF WE'RE NOT DOING THINGS TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER THAT WILL INHIBIT. THE KIND OF COALITION PACKAGE THAN TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER NO THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS IS SENATOR GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOUR WORK SIR. LET'S GO TO THE DEAN OF THE SENATE CENTER NIELSEN. SEVEN MEMBERS I WANNA THANK. CENTER WIENER HE'S TAKEN ON A MONUMENTAL [inaudible] EFFORT HERE. ONE THAT. HAS PREOCCUPIED THE LEGISLATURE FOR MANY YEARS BUT IT APPEARS TO ME HAVING WATCHED FOR A NUMBER OF YEAR THAT MAYBE SOME SOMETHING THIS. WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMEWHERE. INDEED MAYBE IN A PACKAGE BUT THIS WOULD BE A KEY. FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THAT PACKAGE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BEING SENSITIVE SO LONG TIME CONCERNS. THE VALLEY COUNTIES HAVE BEEN. PLAGUED WITH. MASSES OF PEOPLE MOVING OUT. OF THE AREAS WHERE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE. AND WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE TRANSIT. BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN THESE AREAS. I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT WHAT WE PUT IN ALL THIS MONEY INTO TRANSIT AND THEREBY STILL MOVING OUT. WHAT'S THE TRANSIT. FOR IF YOU COULD EVEN ARGUE HOW'S IT GOING TO BE SUSTAINED WITHOUTA RIDERSHIP. WELL THIS IS THE ADDRESSES OF ONE OF THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL. AND VERY PARTICULARLY. OUR HOUSING PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED OVER DECADES BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE IMPOSING ITSELF. AND ITS WILL ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN MANY WAYS. THAT HAVE IMPEDED THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE HOUSING THE PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. CERTAINLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN GUILTY AS WELL. BUT IN YOUR CASE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING SENSITIVE. TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT A LOT OF DISCUSSION HAS. CENTERED AROUND THAT HERE. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT THE END OF THE FOR THE BILL MOVING ALONG AND I WOULD OFFER A MOTION FOR SUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH LAYS IN GERMAN OF THE COMMITTEE WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR. BUT WE'RE GONNA TAKE A VERY BRIEF RECESS BEFORE WE DO WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CONVERSATIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT. HEARING SEE NINE DAYS CHEN WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE WE APOLOGIZE WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO GET -- ARE. OUR WORK HERE TOGETHER I AM WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU HERE IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS THANK YOU SO MUCH EMAIL THE YEAH [inaudible] YEAH WELCOME BACK LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND WE ARE GETTING A TORTURE LUNCH HOUR -- DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S PATIENCE. WOULD LIKE TO BETTER DO ONE LAST CALL OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CLOSING COMMENTS -- OTHERWISE I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS AND I GIVE IT A TURN IT OVER TO CENTER WIENER THE BILL TO PROVIDE HIS CLOSING COMMENTS TO COMMITTEE. XENON. AGAIN I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT FIRST OF ALL. TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU WHETHER YOU ARE OPPOSE OR SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR WEEK DAY. JOIN US IN LENDING YOUR VOICE ADD TO THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS LOOKING AHEAD I THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE LAST TIME THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING. THERE IS GONNA BILLY AMPLE OPPORTUNITY AS THIS MOVE TOWARDS AYE IF THIS COMMITTEE -- AFFIRMS. TOWARDS APPROPRIATION. TO THE FLOOR THE SENATE. AND I OBVIOUSLY TO GET OFF THE FLOOR THE SENATE. TWENTY TIMING POLICY COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY IS WELL. MY BOTTOM LINE IS -- LAST YEAR I DID NOT SUPPORT. EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN AS I WAS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. IN CANDIDLY WHAT WORKS FOR DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. DOESN'T WORK FOR A COUNTY OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OR LESS. CAN I ASK THE SERGEANTS IF WE COULD PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR THANK YOU SO MUCH. AS I WAS SAYING WHAT WORKS FOR DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES OR A CITY OF FOUR MILLION DOESN'T WORK NECESSARILY FOR A COUNTY OF A POPULATION. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS OR LEX. AND I'M ALSO A BELIEVER THAT NO COMMUNITY SHOULD SEE DRAMATIC CHANGE BUT EVERY COMMUNITY SHOULD SEE SOME CHANGE. I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS NOT A SILVER BULLET. TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS. WE HAVE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS MOVING RIGHT NOW OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN ONE TIME AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS. AND WE NEED A PERMANENT ONGOING SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS WHY IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO PASS. SB. FIVE OUR REAL CRISIS IN THIS STATE EXISTS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE CATEGORIES OF LOW INCOME AND VERY LITTLE LOW INCOME OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING? AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE HOUSING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THE WORK FORCE IN FAMILIES AND SENIORS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN RELATED TO BUS STOPS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE BUS STOPS BECAUSE AS I'VE SAID BEFORE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THAT ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN PLACE TODAY WILL WORK FOR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE LORENA HAD WAYS DURING PEAK PERIODS IN TEN MINUTES. WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM WHERE WE WERE. COMING INTO THIS HEARING. ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS THAT WERE ADVANCED BY COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE CALIFORNIA COAST. WITH PLEASE AMEND AMENDMENTS ONLY THE HIGHEST QUALITY STOCKS. WE'LL BE INCLUDING. I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION. TO THE AMENDMENTS. TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE VOTING ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. A FULL LIST OF THE AMENDMENTS. WILL BE PROVIDED AT ONE PM OUTSIDE THIS COMMITTEE. IN THE HALL. WILL BE VOTING ON THE DISTRIBUTION AMENDMENTS WITH THREE CLARIFICATIONS TODAY. NUMBER ONE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE CONVERSIONS BUT NO DEMOLITION STATE WHY. CLARIFICATION COASTAL ZONES COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT IS EXCLUDED IN CITIES A FIFTY THOUSAND OR BELOW. STATEWIDE. AND THAT'S FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION OR BELOW [inaudible] AND DEVELOPMENT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES STATEWIDE. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR. BUT BEFORE WE GO TO A FORMAL VOTE. WE LIKE TO GO TO TURN IT OVER TO CENTER WIENER AND I WANNA INDEED HERE. CENTER WINNER AND I HAVE NOT ALWAYS AGREED OVER THESE PAST. THREE OR FOUR MONTHS. BUT ONE THING THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS FOCUS ON ITS COLLABORATION RESPECT. I AND WHILE WE MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE I GREATLY RESPECT THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO. I WHEN HE SEES YOU IN HIS WORD HE STICKS TO IT. AND I'M GRATEFUL I AND IT HAS BEEN. COMPROMISE ON BOTH SIDES THE ENTIRE WAY. THIS IS NOT THE EASIEST OF BILLS THAT WILL BE IN FRONT OF THIS LEGISLATURE. AND HE'S WILLING TO BE A TACKLE ONE OF OUR TOUGHEST CHALLENGES. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. AND WE'RE GONNA NEED YOUR VOICE IS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS POLICY STRONGER. SO WITHOUT FURTHER DO CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL YOUR COLLABORATION YOUR COMPROMISED. THE FLOOR IS YOURS FOR THE CLOSING STATEMENT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH US AND ALSO YOUR STAFF -- FOR WORKING HARD. WITH MY STAFF -- WE ALL AS IT AS A TEAM I THINK BEEN WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO COME TO A GOOD RESOLUTION.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MR SENATOR MEMBERS. THE MOTION IS AS FOLLOWS IN THIS IS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BY CENTER NIELSEN. MOTION HONEST SB FIFTY IS A DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS.

IT WOULD BE NICE NAY JEEZ YEAH GIVEN ALL RIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK TOGETHER. WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT OUR AFTERNOON SESSION HERE TODAY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE OUT OF THIS ROOM AT APPROXIMATELY. TWELVE FIFTEEN H. -- WE WILL BE RECONVENING IN. THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE RECONVENING IN. THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE AT APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRTY ISHE. I WITH A FULL AFTERNOON -- IF YOU EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE DINNER IN COMMITTEE. YOU'RE THINKING RIGHT. I AS WE WILL BE GOING OUT LATE INTO THE NIGHT OUT WITH THE REMAINDER OF OUR BILLS. OUT OF THE TWENTY SEVEN BILLS WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. ONE SO WE APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S PATIENCE AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK. MEMBERS WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR THIS IS ITEM NUMBER NINE SB. TWO FORTY ONE ON VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION FIND SOMEONE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE VICE CHAIR FOR ALL OF HIS WORK ON THIS. MORE LIKE THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO FOCUS ON VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS OR VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION FUNDS KNOWN AS THE CF. FOR IN OUR CASE SO AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS WALLY KAHN'S. THE PREVIOUS CHAIR SENATOR HERTZBERG. HELD A HEARING ON VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS IN LOS ANGELES WE LEARNED THAT THIS MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE INCOME TAX FORM. FIVE FORTY PAGE WISE COULD USE SOME SERIOUS IMPROVEMENTS. MISTER CHAIR YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AN OUTSTANDING LEADER. IN PROVIDING DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE ON THIS UNIQUE ENDEAVOR. WE ARE BOTH TERRIBLY INCLINED AND DESIRE CALIFORNIA'S NON PROFITS TO THRIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BENEFIT OF TAX DEDUCTIBILITY HAS BEEN REDUCED IN RECENT MONTHS. ALLOW ME TO SHARE HOW SENATE BILL TWO FORTY ONE WILL TURBO CHARGE BALI CONS AND ASSIST ARE CRITICAL NONPROFIT SECTOR. MR SURE LET ME BEGIN BY FIRST ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AS YOUR LIKELY AWARE WE ARE SEEING A DECLINE IN DONATIONS TO THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION PROGRAM. I RECENTLY SPOKE TO A LARGE GATHERING A CONFERENCE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS AND ASK THEM HOW MANY WERE EVEN ADVISING OR MENTIONING VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS. IN THE TAX ORGANIZER IS THAT THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR CLIENTS. OUT OF SOME TWO HUNDRED PRESENT ONLY TO RAISE THEIR HANDS. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD DATA CONFIRMS THAT. IS ONLY ABOUT A 2% PARTICIPATION RATE WITH VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS. A FEW YEARS AGO EVEN TURBOTAX. FAILED TO INCLUDE THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS IN THEIR SOFTWARE. IN ROLE AGENTS ARE ALSO IGNORING THIS OPPORTUNITY IN ADVISING THEIR CLIENTS EACH OF THE CURRENT FUNDS HAVE BEEN ADDED THROUGH LEGISLATION. IT CAN BE SEEN AS UNFAIR. TO ONLY ALLOWED CHARITIES WHO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE. DONATIONS A CASE OF THE TWO YOU KNOW. AND HOW INFLUENTIAL IN LOBBYING AN ORGANIZATION IS. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD NOTES THAT ROUGHLY FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IS CONTRIBUTED EACH YEAR AND THAT'S FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS DOES NOT SEEM TO INCREASE OR DECREASE BY A WIDE MARGIN. THEREFORE THE SAME PEOPLE SEEM TO BE DONATING. HOWEVER MORE FUNDS ARE ADDED TO THE PROGRAM EACH YEAR. IF WE DO NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CONTRIBUTORS THE AMOUNT EACH FUND WILLRECEIVE WILL DECREASE EVERY YEAR AND AS THOSE THAT RECEIVE THESE DONATIONS NO THE PRIVACY LAWS PREVENT CONTRIBUTOR DATA DIET DATA DIVERGENT EVEN KNOW WHO IS ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING. TO YOUR FINE SO YOU CAN'T SOLICIT THEM ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. BUT TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL WE NEED MORE MOTIVATING FACTORS. THAT'S THE INTENT OF SB. TWO FORTY ONE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CHARITIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. SHOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DONORS. YOU GET THE NONPROFIT INDUSTRY TO SHARE THEIR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER WITH THEIR MEMBERS THROUGH MARKETING. THEY CAN UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS MAILERS AND PROMOTE THEIR CAUSE AT MEETINGS. THE ENTIRE PROGRAM SHOULD BE MARKETED IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY AND BY INCREASING ELIGIBILITY I BELIEVE WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT SUCCESS. OUT OF FIVE PAGES THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION PROGRAM. PROGRAMS TAKE UP AN ENTIRE PAGE HOW LONG UNTIL WE ADD MORE AND HAVE TO ADD A SIX PAGE. EACH OF THE FUNDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY LISTED WITH THE PROGRAM ARE WORTHY CAUSES BUT I BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY OTHER CHARITIES. WHO ARE ALSO WORTHY THEY JUST DON'T HAVE FRIENDS IN THE LEGISLATURE WHO CAN ADD THEM TO THE LIST? IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE CONTRIBUTION OPTIONS FOR TAXPAYERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION PROGRAM THIS BILL MAKES SEVERAL PROCEDURAL CHANGES SUCH AS ELIMINATES THE CURRENT REPEAL DATES. FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS MEMORIAL FUND AND THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL FUND. IT REQUIRES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO DEVELOP AN APPLICATION TO ALLOW CHARITIES WHO APPLIED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM. IT DEFINES QUALIFICATIONS THAT CHARITIES MUST MEET IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE. IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE CHARITIES MUST COMPLETE THE APPLICATION WHICH INCLUDES BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION EVIDENCE OF QUALIFICATIONS AND APPLICATION FEE. CHARITIES MUST CONTINUE TO MEET QUALIFICATION SPELL OUT OF RENEWAL APPLICATION AND PAY RENEWAL FEES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE. IF CHARITIES NO LONGER MEET QUALIFICATIONS THEIR ELIGIBILITY WILL BE REVOKED IF ELIGIBILITY IS REVOKED CHARITIES MAY RE APPLY TO THE PROGRAM AFTER ONE YEAR. TAXPAYERS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO MORE THAN ONE CHARITY. IT ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION FUND IN THE STATE TREASURY TO RECEIVE CONTRIBUTIONS. IT REQUIRES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO NOTIFY THE STATE COMPTROLLER THE DOLLAR AMOUNT INDIVIDUALS DONATED TO THE FUND. IT REQUIRES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO CREATE INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS FOR EACH PARTICIPATING CHARITY. IT REQUIRES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO CREATE MAINTAIN SEARCH A SEARCHABLE WEBSITE FOR CHARITIES TO BE LISTED WHERE TAXPAYERS MAY FIND THE CHARITIES IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. IT REQUIRES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO CREATE A NEW FIELD ON THE TAX FORM FOR TAXPAYERS TO ENTER THE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. OF THEIR DESIRE CHARITY AND DONATION AMOUNT. THE FUNDS CURRENTLY LISTED ON THE TAX FROM WILL CONTINUE TO BE LIFTED UNTIL THEY'RE ALREADY PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED REPEAL DATE. ONCE OFFENSE WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE HAVE EXPIRED THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WILL LIST THE TOP SEVEN GROSSING FUNDS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AND THE THREE PERMANENT FUNDS THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL SENIORS FIND CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS MEMORIAL FUND AND THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL FUND ON THE TAX FORM. THE TOP SEVEN GROSSING FUNDS THAT WILL BE LISTED WILL BE REVOLVING YOUR TO YOUR BASED ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S CONTRIBUTIONS. AND REQUIRES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO CREATE AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AN ANNUAL REPORT THE TRACK TO FIND COSTS AND CONTRIBUTION LEVELS. IT ALSO ALLOWS THE STATE AUDITOR TO AUDIT THE FUNDED NECESSARY AND WISHES AND REASONABLE FEES TO COVER THE COST OF ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM. AND BECAUSE IT'S A BIG ENDEAVOR RESEARCHER WE HAVE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE. TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME ON ON THIS PROJECT THIS REFORM SHOULD HELP. THE EXISTING FUNDS AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY FILERS AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. TWO FORTY ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A VICE CHAIR AND I JUST. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE VICE CHAIR FOR WADING INTO THIS SOME CALL IT A SWAMP. THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS ON THIS BILL.

PROPOSES TO MODIFY THE PROPERTY TAX INHERENT IT'S EXCLUSION LAW PROSPECTIVELY. TO REQUIRE CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN THAT INHERENT HOME TO ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE HOME IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR PROP THIRTEEN BASE YEAR AND TO AVOID REASSESSMENT. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT ALLOWS PARENTS TO LEAVE THEIR HOME TO A CHILD AND NOT HAVE THAT HOME REASSESSED. YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND STRUGGLING FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS ALL HAVE TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES ON THE FULL VALUE OF THEIR HOMES.

WELL IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT VOTERS TO IMPOSE EXTEND OR INCREASE A PARTIAL TAX WITH THAN THE CURRENT TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT DESPITE STATE FUNDING INCREASES IN K. THROUGH TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS MANY SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ARE STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN QUALITY EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. DUE TO THESE PRESSURES AN ESTIMATED TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL HAVE DEFICITS IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICT. MANY DISTRICTS HAVE HAD TO LAY OFF FOR FOR LOW TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF AND CUT EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. WELCOME UNITY COLLEGES SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENT POPULATIONS THERE PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVELS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN YOU SEE ISSUES OR YOU SEE PARTIAL TAXES ARE ONE OF THE FEW WAYS. LOCAL SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ARE ABLE TO RAISE REVENUE AND SUPPLEMENT FUNDS THEY RECEIVE FROM THE STATE. BUT THEY REMAIN IN THE INACCESSIBLE TO MOST COMMUNITIES GIVEN THE HIGH TWO THIRDS VOTER THRESHOLD OF A 55% VOTING THRESHOLD I PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN PLACE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PARTIAL TAX MEASURES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROVED MORE THAN 80%. OF THE TWENTY SIX A LOCAL SCHOOL PARTIAL TAX MEASURES THAT FAILED IN CALIFORNIA. FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WOULD HAVE PASSED IF A SUPER MAJORITY VOTE OF 55% WERE REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL INSTEAD OF A TWO THIRDS VOTE. SCA BOUGHT FIVE IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT FAIRNESS EXISTING LAW HAS ENABLED A MINORITY OF VOTERS TO BLOCK EFFORTS TO PROVIDE VITAL. LOCAL EDUCATION FUNNY THIS IS LIKE THIS IS REALLY CONTRARY TO OUR DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES. WE WERE WITH RESPECT TO REQUIRING SUPERMAJORITY VOTES JAMES MADISON WROTE IN THE FEDERALIST PAPERS. WELL IT WOULD BE NO LONGER IT WOULD BE NO LONGER THE MAJORITY THAT WOULD RULE THE POWER WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE MINORITY SIMILARLY. ALEXANDERHAMILTON WROTE QUOTE WHAT A FIRST SIGHT MAY SEEM A REMEDY IS IN REALITY A POISON. TO GIVE A MINORITY A NEGATIVE UPON THE MAJORITY IS IN ITS TENDENCY TO SUBJECT THE SENSE OF THE GREATER NOW. TO THAT OF THE LESSER SCA FIVE RETAINS THE REQUIREMENT FOR SUPERMAJORITY APPROVAL OF LOCAL SCHOOL PARTIAL FACTORS BUT THE LEGISLATION CHANGES THE SUPERMAJORITY THRESHOLD. TO A MORE REALISTIC PERCENTAGE. HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER HELL IT WE HAVE A BOOK OF QUOTES AN IMPORTANT BILL ON ALL ISSUES OF EDUCATION VERY GRATEFUL SIR. WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO KICK US OFF IN REGARDS TO BEING OUR WITNESS? ALL RIGHT IF YOU COULD PLEASE GIVE US YOUR FIRST AND LAST AS WELL AS YOUR ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MY NAME IS RICHARD FERRER I'M ON THE BOARD OF THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WELCOME SENATOR UNIFIED REPRESENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS DATED TWELVE WITH THE SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- THE STATISTICS THAT SENATOR HILL WAS GOING. GOING PROVED VERY MUCH IS REALITY THAT IT IS MY ELEVENTH YEAR ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. EVERY YEAR EVERY SPRING I AS WE TRY TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET WERE FACED WITH SO PIECE CHOICES. I DO WE CUT COUNSELORS DO WE INCREASE CLASS SIZES I DO WE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE OUR TEACHERS WERE HAVING A MORE A MORE DIFFICULT TIME. IN ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. BEING THAT. WE KNOW WILL TAKE A CONCERTED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL DISTRICTS AND THE STATE TO ADDRESS. BUT WE ARE READY AND WILLING TO PLAY OUR PART. OUR DISTRICT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS GONE FOR VOTERS THREE TIMES. PER BOND MEASURES I EACH OF THOSE BOND MEASURES OF PAST THAT'S A TOTAL OF EIGHT AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT LOCAL VOTERS. HAVE INVESTED IN THEIR LOCAL SCHOOLS. I BUT NONE OF THOSE MEASURES WOULD HAVE MEDIC TWO THIRDS SPECIAL WE JUST PASSED IN NOVEMBER A AT THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR BOND MEASURE. I THAT GOT 65% OF THE VOTE THAT WOULD HAVE FAILED AT A TWO THIRDS A THRESHOLD. SO WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT LOCAL VOTERS WILL SUPPORT THEIR LOCAL SCHOOLS IF WE HAVE A FAIR PLAYING. AND JUST BRINGING DOWN THE THRESHOLD 255% I THE SAME THAT WERE ABLE TO DO THE SAUDIS BONDS BUT TO BE ABLE TO INVEST BAD INTO INTO MONEY INTO. LAST ROOMS I WOULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE IN OUR ABILITY TO OUT OF THE EDUCATOR. THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE AND YOU TRAVEL NORTH.

THIS TO THE WAY SCHOOL SEE COMMUNITY SUPPORT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS FOR THE CHILDREN THEY SERVE. CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. LEAVING MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHOUT THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN WITH ALL THE PUBLIC EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. OUR DISTRICTS ARE NOT RECEIVING ADEQUATE FUNDING FROM BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. AS A TWENTY THREE YEAR VETERAN. I SEE IT EVERY DAY. YEAR IN YEAR OUT I USE THE WORD VETERAN BECAUSE I FEEL I TOO AM AT WAR. TO SEEK FUNDING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION WE ARE CONTINUALLY UNDER ATTACK. AND TO HAVE TO BATTLE FOR THE BASIC SERVICES OUR STUDENTS NEED IS LUDICROUS. I AM CURRENTLY WITNESSING IN MY DISTRICT CUTS TO VITAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS READING INTERVENTION MATH INTERVENTION SPECIAL EDUCATION. NURSING AND COUNSELING. SCIENCE AND STEM PROGRAMS AND CAREER TECH EDUCATION. AS I SEE IT. IT IS OUR DUTY. TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM. LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT LOCAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT AND SHOULD HAVE THE FAIRNESS OF BEING ABLE TO PASS PARCEL TAXES. BELOW THE TWO THIRDS SPECIAL THAT WE SEE NOW.

WE'D LIKE TO GETA LOOK FOR LAST CALL LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCED MICRO LAST CALL. ALL RIGHT NOW WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BETTER [inaudible] TO OPPOSITION. IF WE'RE GONNA BE IF WE CAN MAKE ROOM FOR OPPOSITION PLEASE. THE WAY WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO RUN OPPOSITION IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE EQUAL TIME. FOR EACH SIDE WE'RE GONNA HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS. I AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SECONDARY WITNESSES I TO BE A TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO KICK US OFF AS A PRIMARY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER SHERMAN I'M GONNA MISS TOMAGO FIRST OKAY. THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE YOU MINE -- THERE WE GO. THANK YOU SIR. THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND THEN OUR SECONDARY WITNESSES WHAT TWO MINUTES EACH WE WELCOME YOU BACK TO COMMITTEE IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TO RESTORE MAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. AND WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THE WELL AS PROVIDING A POLICY A QUALITY EDUCATION WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. THE FIRST IS BY FACILITATING PARCEL TAX INCREASES THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR CALIFORNIANS TO AFFORD EITHER THE RENTAL OR HOME OWNERSHIP. THIS MORNING THE COMMITTEE SPENT OVER TWO HOURS TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT LESS AFFORDABLE FOR CALIFORNIANS. OUR SECOND ISSUE IS THAT. SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE A SPECIAL CONSTITUTION ALL OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REQUIRED TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR TAX WILL TAX INCREASES. HOWEVER FOR SCHOOL BONTA CONSTITUTION ALREADY GRANTS A LOWER VOTE THRESHOLD FOR SCHOOL BONDS AT THIS TIME. THE EDUCATION FUNDING UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH PROPERTY TAXES HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY GOING. AND HAVE THAT HAS PROVIDE A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND BRACED REVENUES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING PRIMARILY WHICH GOOD EDUCATION SO WE QUESTION THE NEED FOR THE BILL AT THIS TIME. LAST AND NOT LEAST THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF ON YOUR RELEASED A POLL ON MARCH TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THAT POLL INDICATED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY. A VOTERS SUPPORTED. THE TWO THIRDS AND MAINTAINING THE CURRENT VOTE THRESHOLD AND THAT WAS A CROSS DEMOGRAPHICS BOTH REPUBLICAN VOTERS AS WELL AS DEMOCRATIC VOTERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THAT ENCOMPASSES LARGE COUNTIES AND CITIES INCLUDING A LATE SUMMER CISCO Là AND LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE EXEDRA AND THOSE IN SMALLER COUNTIES. SO WE QUESTION THE NEEDTO CHANGE THE VOTE THE SHOW AT THIS TIME AND ALSO THE MAJORITY OF DOLE'S I THINK IT'S OVER 60% CURRENTLY APPROVED BY VOTERS AT THE TWO THIRDS DASCHLE. SO IN OUR OPINION AND OUR HUMBLE OPINION THERE'S REALLY NO NEED TO CHANGE THE VOTE SPECIAL WHEN THERE HAD BEEN BILLS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PASS OF THE TWO THIRDS. VOTE THRESHOLD THAT HAS RESULTED IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS GOING BACK. LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE AND REFORMATTING THAT PROPOSAL SO THAT IT IS BETTER HAS GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR VOTERS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE TWO THIRDS VOTE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE BILL HAS ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. BUT BASED ON TRACK RECORD THAT WE HAVE AND FROM A DATABASE. OF THE LOWER VOTE THRESHOLD IS NOT NECESSARY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WARFARE WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND I DO JUST WANT TO BEGIN BY PICKING UP ON THE THEME THAT MISSED HIM AND TALKED ABOUT ABOUT WEARING A TWO THIRDS VOTE BING UNNECESSARY. THERE'S MANY COUNTIES MEMBERS INCLUDING ORANGE COUNTY THAT HAVE PASSED TRANSPORTATION SALES TAX MEASURES WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE SO CARLY THE THRESHOLD CAN BE REACHED AND WE KNOW IT CAN BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE WEBSITE CALIFORNIA CITY FINANCE. A REVIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT PERSONAL TAXES SINCE TWENTY TWELVE SHOWED THAT IN NOVEMBER ELKS IN NOVEMBER ELECTION SINCE BEEN APPROVED. THE MAIN ISSUE MEMBERS THAT WE HAVE WITH PERSONAL TAXES IS THAT THEY ARE VERY REGRESSIVE IN THAT NO MATTER IF YOU OWN A ONE BEDROOM HOUSE OR A MILLION DOLLAR MANSION. YOU PAY THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT -- IN TEN THROUGH THIRDS VOTE IS FOR HOMEOWNERS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ALSO BECAUSE WELL EVERYBODY GETS TO VOTE ON THESE LOCAL PERSONAL TAXES ONLY PROPERTY OWNERS PAY THEM. YOU KNOW I LOVE BRING UP THIS QUOTING COMMITTEE EVERY YEAR AND I ATTRIBUTE IT TO BEN FRANKLIN IT'S A TRIBUTE TO BEN FRANKLIN SAID. DEMOCRACY IS TWO WOLVES AND A SHEEP DECIDING WHAT'S FOR DINNER. AND I LOVE THAT QUOTE BECAUSE I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE BILL YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANNA CARRY THE METAPHOR ON TOO FAR BUT TAXPAYERS ARE THE SHEEP AND THE NEED TO BE PROTECTED IN THIS INSTANCE. AND HAVING A TWO THIRDS VOTE INSURERS THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND I'LL JUST CLOSE MISTER CHAIRMAN BY SAYING FINALLY THIS MEASURE DOES NOTHING EVEN AS MR MAY MENTIONED. TO AID AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE'S ONLY 30% OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS RIGHT NOW THAT CAN AFFORD A MEDIAN PRICED HOME A FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ADDING PERSONAL TAXES. IN THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR THERE'S NOTHING TO AID THAT AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR MILLENNIALS LIKE ME AND OTHER PEOPLE TO OF SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS ASPIRIN ABOUT. THIS WOLF IT WE HAVE THE WAR OF DOING QUOTE TODAY -- A WATCH OUT THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL RIGHT YOU'RE PICKING PER GAME SIR. ALSO IF IN THE PAPERS AGAINST. SENATOR HILL HE HASN'T QUITE IT EXPERIENCE LET US ALL BE ON ANY OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. WE RESPECT THE PASSIONOF THE CENTER FOR EDUCATION FINANCE BUT WE ALSO -- AND IN FACT OUR FAMILY BUSINESS OR SOME OF THE MOST PHILANTHROPIC SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN. IN CALIFORNIA COMMITTED TO CALIFORNIA THE CHALLENGES YOU CAN'T LOOK AT ONE TAX. INDEPENDENT OF THE REST OF MY THINK THAT THAT'S THE REFERENCE OF THIS OF THE THE STUDY OF THE PP I SEE STUDY. THAT THEY SAID LOOK THIS IS WHAT ONE TAX I IN A HIGH TAX STATE. WE NEED A TWO THIRDS VOTE IS APPROPRIATE WHEN. LOOKING AT IT COMPARED TO ALL THE REST OF THE TAXES THAT ARE REQUIRED ON BUSINESSES AND AND FRANKLY OUR EMPLOYEES AS WELL. SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT AND AND AS MR WILL PUT IT OUT THIS IS DO NOT COULD DEVOTE BUT THEY DO YOU KNOW OWN PROPERTY AND PAY THESE ADDITIONAL TAXES. AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE AGAIN THE FOCUS ON EDUCATION BUT AT THIS POINT NOT MUST CONTINUE TO OPPOSE. CHARLIE I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE -- INTO OUR WITNESSES WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP TO THOSE WHO OPPOSE IF YOU JUST GIVE US YOUR FIRST AND LAST AS WELL AS ORGANIZATION WELCOMED COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SERRA BOOT ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU HAVE TO ANSWER EVERY MISTER MEMBERS REC TIME ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION ALSO. THANK YOU SIR I'M [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. APOLOGIES FOR GOING OUT OF ORDER BUT NANCY TRIED ASSISTING US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S GOOD TO SEE. BRING TO A LAST CALL LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD LOOKING FOR THOSE WERE OPPOSED. ALL RIGHT WE LIKE TO BETTER BRING IN BACK TO COMMITTEE. TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF CENTER HILL. I HAVE JUST A FEW COMMENTS BUT ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR AS WELL. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR BELL LOOK. I THINK THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SOME OF THE CONCERN THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS REYES AMBER STILL LOOKING IN SUPERMAJORITY VOTERS. WERE STILL GONNA PROVEN EFFECTIVE 5%. AND GOING OFF OF WHERE WE COULD BE ABOVE AND BEYOND 50% PLUS. ONE MR WILL BRINGS UP A POINT REGARDS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK THAT'S WHY STATE IS ADVANCING TWELVE BILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT A PERMANENT SOURCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BACK IN. AND BE ABLE TO LOOK AT PICKING UP THE PACE WHEN IT COMES APPROVAL OF HOUSING ESPECIALLY ON A PORTABLE [inaudible] THAT SAID. WANT TO SEE ANY FINAL THOUGHTS AS WELL AS YOUR CLOSING STILL IMAGES THANK YOU AND AND MY ONLY THOUGHT IS JUST YOU KNOW MISTER WOLF DID MAKE THE RATES THE COMMENT LOVE HIS METAPHOR ABOUT THE SHEEP BUT YOU KNOW ABOUT PROTECTING. THE POPULATION TECHNOLOGY CITIZENS. THEY ARE PROTECT. YOU'RE PROTECTED BY THEIR VOTE. THEY CAN EITHER AS A MAJORITY VOTE. IN THAT VOTE. SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY MAJORITY IN THAT DECISION NOT BY A MINORITY AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS TODAY THIS IS IT THIS IS JUST BASIC. BASIC DEMOCRACY AND THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD TREAT. OUR ELECTIONS THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD TREAT TAXATION AND THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD TREAT THE EVER EVERYTHING THAT THE SOCIETY IN THIS COUNTRY IS BASED ON I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE MEMBERS.

FIRE MORE LOT FELL A BILL I HERTZBERG. HELLO NIELSEN WIENER. WE ARE ALL RIGHT. TWO ZERO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBER. I SEE. MANY CALL YOU SEE KATHLEEN GALGIANI HERE -- CENTER GALGIANI HAS IS BEING. SEVEN SEVENTY KATHLEEN GALGIANI YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED THE PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT PROGRAM TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS. BY ALLOWING QUALIFIED HOMEOWNERS TO POSTPONE PROPERTY TAXES WHY THIS PROGRAM IS VALUABLE FOR COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS AND ESPECIALLY OUR ELDERLY UNFORTUNATELY THE PROGRAM HAS ALWAYS HAD HISTORICALLY LOW PARTICIPATION RATES. COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS. SB SEVEN SEVENTY ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY EXPANDING HOMEOWNER ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM BY LOWERING THE EQUITY REQUIREMENT FOR EACH POSTPONEMENT CLAIM FOR PROPERTY TAX DEFERMENT. ELIGIBILITY FROM 40% 220%. I WILL BE ACCEPTING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REQUIRING THAT APPLICANTS HAVE NO MORE THAN ONE LEAN AGAINST THEIR PROPERTY. AND MEMBERS MEMBER LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE RATIONALE FOR THIS LEGISLATION -- SENATOR BELL WHEN YOU AND I WERE IN THE ASSEMBLY TOGETHER WE WENT THROUGH THE HOUSING CRISIS AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT THEY HIT A RECORD LOW A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER WHERE THOSE HOMES WERE WORTH. HALF OF WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY WERE WORTH IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE HOME PRICES HAVE RECOVERED BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE HOME PRICES ARE STILL. ARTIFICIALLY LOW AND MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASED HOMES DURING THAT TIME WHEN PRICES WERE AT RECORD HIGHS. THEY STILL HAVE LESS THAN 20% EQUITY IN THEIR HOME SO IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WAS FIFTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE I TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. AND THERE THE VALUE OF THEIR HOME CRASHED AND THEY'RE NEEDING THIS ASSISTANCE. IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE -- EVEN 20% EQUITY IN THEIR HOME. BEFORE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS WE DID OFFER THIS PROGRAM AS LONG AS INDIVIDUALS HAD AT LEAST 20% EQUITY IN THEIR HOME AND NOW. THAN THAT PROGRAM WENT AWAY BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THEN WHEN IT WAS RESTORED. THE LEGISLATURE CAUTIOUSLY REIMPLEMENTED THE PROGRAM WITH A MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO AGAIN BOUGHT. WHEN HOMES WERE RECORD HIGHS? IT WOULD BE YEARS BEFORE THEY COULD REACH THAT 40% EQUITY LEVEL SO WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IN THIS BILL IS FOR US TO SIMPLY RETURN. TO THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAD IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN BUT WE ACTUALLY MAKE. WHERE HOMEOWNERS CAN INDEED PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM IF THE NEED ARISES FOR THEM TO DO SO AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE? THANK YOU AND YOU MADE AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL YES IDEA EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE IN MINUTES. WE HAVE -- SPEAKERS IN FAVOR OF THE BILL [inaudible] THE MONEY. ABOUT -- TO OPPOSITION ANYBODY OPPOSED. LISTEN TO THIS BILL THIS IS SO. SB -- SEVENTY SEVEN ZERO INITIAL COMMENTS -- I WOULD MENTION THAT IF.

FIVE THIRTY ONE MISTER GLAZIER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SAME AYE ISSUE DIFFERENT APPROACH YEAH -- AS AS ALL TALK ABOUT IN JUST A MOMENT BUT FIRST I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU AT THE CHAIR IN YOUR TO YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH. MY TEAM TO IMPROVE THIS BILL AND I ACCEPT THE PROPOSED. COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. SB FIVE THIRTY ONE SIXTY AND PERVERSE INCENTIVES IN OUR CURRENT TAX CODE. THAT HAVE LED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GIVE AWAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE TO PRIVATE COMPANIES. UNDERTHE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM LOCAL SALES TAX LAW. SALES TAX REVENUES ALLOCATED TO THE POINT OF SALE. FOR A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE THIS MEANS ALLOCATING THE REVENUE TO THE JURISDICTION THE STORE IS LOCATED IN. ONLINE RETAILERS HOWEVER HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY ALLOCATE SALES TAX REVENUES. THE THAT A WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER WORSE EVEN A SALES OFFICE. THIS ALLOWS CORPORATIONS TO DIRECT REVENUES TO A SINGLE JURISDICTION IN THE STATE. NOW CORPORATIONS USE THIS AS LEVERAGE WHEN NEGOTIATING WHERE TO LOCATE WITHIN A STATE. WHAT RESULTS IS A RIG PROCESS IT TO DRIVE CITIES TO ACCEPT INCREASINGLY ONEROUS TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR ONLINE RETAILERS BUILDING? A RECOLLECT RELOCATING IN THEIR JURISDICTION. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS PRIVATE COMPANIES PROFIT BOTH FROM THEIR ONLINE SALES. AND FROM SALES TAX REBATES OFTEN CITIES WILL GIVE THESE COMPANIES THESE CORPORATIONS UP TO A 100%. OF THE SALES TAX REVENUE. THAT'S ALLOCATED TO THEIR JURISDICTION THEY'LL TAKE THAT MONEY AND I'LL GIVE IT TO THOSE CORPORATIONS AS AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO COME. TO THEIR I AREA. THESE COMPANIES BENEFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC. AT A TIME WHEN CITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND PUBLIC PROGRAMS. COMPANIES RECYCLING SIPHONING BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO THESE AGREEMENTS -- WHILE THESE DEALS ARE OFTEN TOUTED FOR CREATING JOBS AND HAVING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS. GAINS ARE DOUBTFUL. SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE THAT THE PROMISED JOBS OR EVEN CREATED EVEN WHEN THEY DO. HOWEVER. JOBS IN THESE WAREHOUSES ARE GRUELING LOW WAGE AND LACK BENEFITS. THE CITY'S NEED REAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING FAMILIES NOT A RACE TO THE BOTTOM FOR THESE REASONS SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WOULD PROHIBIT ANY FUTURE. SALES TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE CORPORATIONS THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE BILL LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD HAVE ENDED. EXISTING AGREEMENTS. AND PLACING THAT MEASURE ON THE BALLOT FOR THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROHIBIT ANY FUTURE SALES TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES. WITH ME I HAVE DâN KERIK FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. WHO HAS AT HELP DAY AND A GREAT? WHEN A GOOD MAN MANY WAYS ALONG THE PROCESS OF THE OF THIS ISSUE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND IS MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DEBATING IT FOR QUITE SOME TIME? AND I APPRECIATE HIM BEING HERE TO SHARE HIS THOUGHTS THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR. KERR GIVE TWO MINUTES -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SETH AND TAKE YOU TO THE SENATOR YOU KNOW FOR OUR FLAG IN AN ISSUE OF LAST YEAR AS WELL THAT IT'S A IT'S IT IS AN EMERGING ISSUE -- AS THE AS OUR ECONOMY CHANGES THE INTERNET PEOPLE MORE MORE PURCHASING OVER THE INTERNET THAT BEGINS TO CHANGE -- CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND IN OFFICE CO WHAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE RALLY BURN TO STARTS AFFECTING WHERE DOLLARS GO. ON THE THE WHILE THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR THE LEAGUE ACTUALLY START STARTED TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A SENSE THAT THINGS WERE CHANGING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. THAT WE COULD GET BEGIN TO GET AHEAD OF IT AS AN ORGANIZATION. AS YOU ALL KNOWS A SALES TAX ALLOCATION RATHER BURNS VERY IMPORTANT TO IT TO CITIES VERY IMPORTANT REVENUE SOURCE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET AHEAD OF THE ISSUE. SO -- ANYWAY THIS BILL -- IN ITS CURRENT FORM -- AS SENATOR SAYS IT FOCUSES ON THE ISSUE OF THESE AGREEMENTS. A GOING FORWARD AND AND YOU KNOW WE HISTORICALLY OF FIGHT HARD -- AS AS I'M SURE SOME OF THE MEMBERS IN THIS BUILDING NO TO PROTECT OUR LOCAL INDIVIDUAL -- FORTY INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OBVIOUSLY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THE TRICKY PART ABOUT THE IS WHEN THERE IS AN AGREEMENT THAT INVOLVES REBATE YOU'RE NOT REBATE YOUR OWN MONEY WHICH IS YOUR OWN DECISION -- IT YOUR GREAT REBATE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S MONEY IN FACT A LOT OF OTHER MAYBE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES IT KIND OF HAS AN EFFECTIVE CONSOLIDATING REVENUE AND THEN RE BETTY. THAT'S THE TOUCHY POINT WITHIN OUR MEMBERSHIP IS IS IS TRYING TO DEFEND THE WIND WERE A LOCAL AGENCY K&lt;c.cyan&gt; CAN HAVE THE&lt;/c&gt; FREEDOM TO MAKE ECONOMIC DECISIONS WITH THEIR OWN REVENUE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT WOULD TOUCH IS ANOTHER COMMUNITIES REVENUES WERE THE SENSE. BUT WE THINK THE BILL IS A HELPFUL STEP A IT'S NOT THE ONLY STEP RELATED TO THIS ISSUE IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER OF MOVING PIECES. AND THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE WILL BE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING IT FORWARD AND WE WOULD -- CERTAINLY -- DRIVE UP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CARE WE NOW WOULD LIKE THAT A WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WHO IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TO PLEASE COME FOR THE MICROPHONE. PLEASE GIVE US YOUR FIRST AND LAST AS WELL AS YOUR ORGANIZATION WE WELCOME YOU TO PLEASE COME FORWARD THIS TIME. WHERE DO A LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE IN SUPPORT? HEARING SEEN NINE WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ANY OPPOSITION. FAIRNESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS. AS WELL AS ONE SECONDARY WITNESS. THAT WORKS PLEASE. I'M GONNA HAVE BY THE TWO WITNESSES VERY SIDE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BE OUR PRIMARY. AND THEN OUR SECONDARY WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES. WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO KICK US OFF AS OUR PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION YES HAPPY BECAUSE ALL RIGHT SO MUCH GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE GIVES YOUR FIRST AND LASTING ORGANIZATION? WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING A COMMITTEE TO YES ABSOLUTELY HI I'M GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND A MEMBER -- ANTI MINETTI HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF FRESNO I RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO ASK. FIVE THIRTY ONE ON IT AGAIN YES THE SAME ISSUE -- DIFFERENT APPROACH BUT I THINK WE ARE STILL OVERALL OPPOSED TO ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO THE RETAIL INCENTIVE AGREEMENTS. ON UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS BILL DOES RANDFATHER IN EXISTING AGREEMENTS WE STILL BELIEVE THAT ELIMINATING PRAYER ON THIS TOOL PROSPECT OF LEE -- COMPLETELY AFFECTS THE ECONOMIC VITALITY DEVELOPMENT AND JOBS THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THESE AGREEMENTS. ON THAT FOR FRESNO THESE INCENTIVE AGREEMENTS HAVE TRANSFORMED OUR ECONOMIC SITUATION DRAMATICALLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE'VE HAD -- FOUR THOUSAND NEW JOBS AS A RESULT OF THESE DISTRIBUTION AND WAREHOUSE CENTERS NOT TO MENTION -- BUT WE HAVE STUDY REVENUES AS WELL THAT CONTRIBUTE TO A SUPPORTING OUR PUBLIC PROGRAMS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS WIDELY KNOWN FOR OUR AG INDUSTRY WHICH IS LARGELY SEASONAL AND LOW WAGE. OUR EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY THE COMMUNITY -- AND DIVERSIFY OUR ECONOMY LOCALLY IS WHAT HELPS SPARK THAT COMPETITION WHAT HELPS RAISE WAGES IN OUR REGION AND THAT'S A RIPPLE EFFECT THAT BENEFITS THE FRESNO ECONOMY AND OUR RESIDENTS IN GENERAL -- WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE WORK GROUP THAT DEVELOPED THE POLICY THAT FOR YOU TODAY WE VOICE OUR CONCERNS THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE THE LEAGUE HAS DECIDED TO TAKE A POSITION. ON STANDING WITH CITIES TO BENEFIT AND SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION RATHER THAN THOSE WHO ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HARMED. AS OBSERVED IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN ON IT DOES SB. FIVE THIRTY ONE ADDRESSES A SYMPTOM NOT A DISEASE. YOU KNOW THE AUDITOR'S REPORT HAD VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS IT ALSO MENTIONED THE E. COMMERCE GAP AS WELL WE HAVE A BILL THAT SITTING BEFORE THE GOVERNOR -- THAT MANY OF YOU VOTED ON AND SUPPORTED TO ADDRESS THE E. COMMERCE GAP. AND YET YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES THAT THE AUDITOR'S REPORT HAD MENTIONED -- TO LOOK AT TRANSPARENCY IN THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS AGAIN WE'RE NOT SURE WHY THIS IS THE FIRST STEP THAT WE'RE TAKING IN THIS DIRECTION WITHOUT THOROUGHLY -- STARTING THE RAMIFICATIONS WE BELIEVE THIS ISSUE MERITS MORE DISCUSSION AND POSSIBLY EVEN A STUDY TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT. I AM IT'S YOU KNOW WE THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MANNER THAT DOESN'T DEVASTATE ROLAND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NOR PERPETUATE WEALTH AND CALL THEM pIN ANY QUALITY. FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. FRESNO AS WELL WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE IN COMMITTEE MA'AM WE WELCOME YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I DO WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR HIS VERY THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS YOU SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME TALKINGTO US AND WE WERE ABLE TO RELAY SOME OF OUR CONCERNS AND IT DOES SHOW IT WAS A VERY. BY -- AWFUL BALANCED ASA SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. MITCHELL WENT OVER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF PARIS WE ARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION UNFORTUNATELY TO SB. FIVE THIRTY ONE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT AWARE AT THE CITY OF PARIS IS LOCATED IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. SEVENTY ONE MILES EAST SOUTHEAST OF LOS ANGELES AND EIGHTY MILES NORTH OF SAN DIEGO. IT'S MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT IS AN INCREASE OF 4% UP FROM LAST YEAR. AND THE POVERTY RATE IN PARIS IS TWENTY ONE POINT 2% AS COMPARED TO OUR NATIONAL POVERTY RATE OF TWELVE POINT 3%. PARIS IS LONG STRUGGLE WITH COM GENERATIONAL POVERTY FOR DECADES AND IS ONLY NOW RECENTLY BEGINNING. TO A SLOW CLIMB OUT OF THAT SITUATION AND THE PRIMARY TOOL THAT HAS ASSISTANCE CITY OF PARIS IT IN DOING THAT HAVE BEEN THESE TYPE OF INCENTIVES AGREEMENTS. THAT ARE TARGETED BY SB. FIVE THIRTY ONE THESE INCENTIVE AGREEMENT HAVE ALLOWED THE CITY OF PARIS TO PROVIDE THEIR CITIZENS WITH CRITICAL SERVICES SUCH AS FIRE AND POLICE. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT AND MORE CRITICALLY THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ALLOW THE CITY TO PROVIDE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ITS RESIDENTS. PARIS HAS AN HONEST BEGAN TO CREATE PARKS AND REC PROGRAMS THE NEVER EXISTED BEFORE. IN FACT THE CITY OF PARIS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND REC FOR THEIR EFFORTS RECEIVING AWARDS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. ALL THESE BENEFITS ARE NOW THREATENED BY SB. FIVE THIRTY ONE WHETHER IT'S THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION OR NOT THIS. BILL DOES CREATE WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE LOSERS ARE THE STATE'S POOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IF ENACTED SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WILL LIMóN EIGHT A LEGAL AND EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL THAT IS CRITICAL FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE PARIS IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN BUSINESSES WITHOUT PROVIDING AN ALTERNATIVE. AS ALREADY STATED THERE IS A BILL THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNOR AND WOULD ADDRESS HE COMMERCE GAPS. I WOULD REDUCE EIGHT THE REQUEST THAT THIS ISSUE DESERVING OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT THE DEVASTATING IMPACT THIS BILL WILL HAVE FOR RULING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE KINDLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO ON SB FIVE THIRTY ONE TODAY AND ALLOW THE CITIES THAT DO NOT AGREE WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES POSITION -- AND THE CITIES THAT ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS BILL TO SIT DOWN WITH THE AUTHOR AND COME TO MORE EQUITABLE RESOLUTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM OF REGRET FOR YOUR HERE. IT IS AN CHEN HERE THE COMMITTEE WE NOW WOULD LIKETO WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THE MICROPHONE. STATE YOUR FIRST AND LAST THE ORGANIZATION. LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED. WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE CENTER ABOUT. IT JUST. EXACTLY HOW MANY OF THESE. YOUR BILL LAST YEAR WITH. I FEEL THEM YEAH SO. WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS. I CENTER I I DON'T HAVE A AN ACCURATE COUNT OF THAT IN FACT. IT'S ADDITIONAL DATA THAT WOULD LIKE TO GET AND PART OF THE REASON WHY WE'RENOT GOING TO THE BILL WE HAD LAST YEAR. IS THAT WE DO LACKS SOME DATA ON WINNERS AND LOSERS AND WE FAST. FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND OTHERS TO HELP US ASSESS THAT WHAT WE DO NOW. I AND THIS IS A DOCUMENT THAT -- RESEARCH THAT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. I IS THAT THAT ONE OF THE CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT SHOULD BE GOING TO PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE CITIES [inaudible] OUR OUR IS THE AMOUNT OF REBATE THAT'S GOING TO THE COMPANIES. WERE TAKING A BILLION DOLLARS A THAT DOESN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY CITIES ARE DOING IT RIGHT HOW MANY AGREEMENTS. BUT THAT'S A CUMULATIVE NUMBER THAT CAME OUT OF THEIR RESEARCH SO. FAR AS I CAN GO. SO IS THERE ANY ONE BIG ONE OR ARE STILL. I KNOW THAT BLOOMBERG NEWS IS STARTING A SERIES TODAY THAT'S LOOKING AT THAT I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO READ IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY IDENTIFIED IN THEIR STORY. I CAN GET BACK TO YOU AS BEST I CAN IN TERMS OF LIKE AMAZON. THERE ARE THERE'S BEEN A SPAM SPATTERING OF STORIES CERTAINLY FRESNO CAME UP IS -- AS A SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENT THAT WAS WAS WAGED. I WOULD NOTE THAT. THIS MEASURE BEFORE YOU DOESN'T AFFECT ANY OF THOSE EXISTING AGREEMENTS. OKAY YEAH NONE OF THEM ARE AFFECTED IT WOULD ONLY BE A FUTURE AGREEMENT. GOING FORWARD THAT THIS BILL WOULD AFFECT. SO LIKE THESE AGREEMENTS ARE. TAKE A BUSINESS OR AN AREA. SO LET'S SAY YEAR THE CITY OF WELL. WELL THERE IS ONE THERE IS A D. A. L.. OKAY WELL LET ME SALES WILL MARYLAND OKAY IT IS THE CITY OF JIM AND JIM I YOU WANT TO LOCATE A WAREHOUSE FROM MY COMPANY IN YOUR IN YOUR AREA OKAY. SO YOU COME TO ME AND YOU SAY STEVE. WOULD YOU LOCATE YOUR COMPANY IN MY AREA -- I MIGHT COME TO YOU AND SAY JIM I I HAVE ON A BILL TO WAREHOUSE. SALE CENTER FOR MY INTERNET COMPANY OMINOUS YOU KNOW WHEN OF TWO HUNDRED PERMANENT JOBS IN YOUR AREA. IF I LOCATED IN YOUR PLACE IN YOUR CITY I YOU'RE GONNA GET OUR ESTá IS YOU'RE GONNA MAKE. A MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BRADLEY BURNS THE REBATE BECAUSE AND GO TO YOU NOW. IF WE GET A WE CAN USE AND I SAY LISTEN. IF WE COME TO YOUR PLACE HELLO ALL ASK IS THAT YOU READ REIMBURSE US. 80% OF THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET 20% WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING EXCEPT TO PROVE IN OUR WAREHOUSE IN YOUR CITY. THAT'S THAT'S THE TYPICAL AGREEMENT OKAY. AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S IN PLACE TODAY. YOU'RE GONNA MAKE 20%. I'M GONNA GET 80% OF THAT IN MY COMPANY AND A 100% OF THAT MONEY WOULD HAVE NORMALLY GONE TO THE CITIES AROUND THE STATE WHERE THAT SALES MIGHT HAVE A SO THE OF THEY ALSO MIX OTHER TAXES WHAT. THOSE ARE ALL PARTS OF DIFFERENT DEALS AGAIN I DIDN'T GET. I'M ONLY DEALING WITH THIS BRADLEY BURNS BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A MOBILE APP YOU WILL UNDER CURRENT DEFINITION IT'S A MOBILE TAXES THE WHERE YOU SS THAT SALES WE DETERMINE THAT SALES. THAT INTERNET SALES THAT YOU MAKE FROM YOUR PLACE IN SAN JOSE IF THAT DISTRIBUTION CENTER THAT WE LOCATE IN THE CITY OF JEMBER BELL. ARE NOW INSTEAD OF GOING TO SAN JOSE TRUCKS THE COMMON DELIBERATE NOW THAT BRADLEY BURNS IS GOING TO THAT AT OTHERS. OKAY EVEN THOUGH YOU ORDERED ON THE INTERNET IN YOUR LOCAL AREA STATE OF GOING YOUR BRICK AND MORTAR THAT WOULD HAVE AFTER THAT AUTOMATICALLY GONE YOUR CITY. THAT MIGHT AS I'VE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENATOR AT TO RAISE YOUR I WANNA HAVE YOU FOCUS ON THE CHANGE. FROM LAST YEAR SO I'M GOING TO PARAPHRASE. YOU ARE KEEPING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE. RECENTLY AGREED UPON CONTRACTS IN PLACE. THAT'S CORRECT IN THAT DOES NOT PRECLUDE THAT LAST YEAR. THE PROPOSAL WAS TO ELIMINATE ALL THESE AGREEMENTS. I AND AND THIS IS THAT A MEMBER I TOOK IN THE ASSEMBLY WAS FACING THOSE CONTRACTS AS EXISTING CONTRACTS OUT OVER TEN YEARS. SO WOULD HAVE PLACED ON THE BALLOT PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE VOTERS HAVE TO DECIDE THAT TYPE OF A CHANGE. AND THEN THE TEN YEAR PHASE AND THAT'S HOW THE AS IT WAS SITTING ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE THAT'S WHERE IT ENDED UP. AND SO DOES HIS ME WAS IT MAYBE WE DID THAT HERE. I'M NT SURE BUT I THINK THAT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE SOMEONE ANOTHER IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE AN ENTITY FROM MAKING TO EXTENDING THEIR CONTRACT NOW. AS WELL I DON'T BELIEVE THE LEGISLATION THREE DOZEN TO AFFECT THAT YEAH THAT SIR THE ONLY REASON I BRING THAT UP IS THAT. AGAIN WANTING TO BE A STRIKE A COMPROMISE RIGHT OF LIGHT. IF SOMEONE IS NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS ON MAKING THIS UP IT'S GIVEN 50% TO MACY'S OR 60% OLD. RIGHT OUR OF WHATEVER THAT REVENUES BACK AND THEY'RE ABLE TO KEEP THE OTHER FORTY OR 50%. THIS BILL WILL NOT INTERRUPTING THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT WITH IT WOULD NOT AND THAT'S WHY THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HEARD FROM WITNESSES THAT SAID WE WERE GOING TO DEVASTATE OVER GOING TO HARM. IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COULD SAY WE'RE GONNA DEVASTATE WE'RE GONNA HARM AND WE'RE NOT. AFFECTING ANY OF THEIR EXISTING AGREEMENTS YEAH I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS. REVISED LEGISLATION IS. I'LL CALL THAT HOLD HARMLESS AT IF YOU HAVE A CONTRACT IN PLACE IT STAYS IN PLACE AND DOES NOT PRECLUDE FOR EXAMPLE THIS YEAR. IF THE MINISTER I WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND IT ALWAYS EXTEND NOW AS WELL I MEAN THAT'S WITHIN THE BILL THAT THAT'S CORRECT AND I I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT ALL THOSE AGREEMENTS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A POTENTIAL CHANGE IN LAW. SO THAT IF WE WERE TO CHANGE THE LAW THOSE CONTRACTS COULD BE VOID I I I BELIEVE THAT MANY THE MERIT THAT WAY SO THAT. THE CITY'S WOULD NOT BE HARMED BY THAT THAT MORNING OF THE CONTRACT BUT THAT WAS UNDER THE OLD BILL LAST YEAR. THIS YEAR IT'S NOT AS YOU'VE EXPLAINED. ALL RIGHT. I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR IF WE HAVE A MOTION TO BE ABLE. TO MOVE ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN SB. FIVE THIRTY ONE WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR BASS IN A GLAZER WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE TO SAY THAT THERE'S AN ASSERTION THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE HURTING POOR COMMUNITIES I'D ARGUE THAT WERE ACTUALLY STEALING FROM FOR COMMUNITIES. RIGHT NOW THAT DESERVE THAT SALES TAX MONEY. TO PAY FOR LOCAL SERVICES FOR STEALING FROM THOSE POOR COMMUNITIES AND IT'S GOING TO THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. THERE ARE MANIPULATING OUR TAX CODE I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR RULES ARE THE BENEFIT A FEW CITIES. BUT REALLY HURTING EVERYBODY ELSE AND WE NEED TO STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT IN THE LONG RUN IN THE SHORT RUN. WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT WORSE THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BILL THAT TO MOVE ALONG AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER GLAZER THIS IS A DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FOR MOTION. BY I SENATOR ABOUT MISS LANE CHESTER BROKE UP PLEASE CHOIR. CHOIR HAD MORE LOCKE L.. I BURKE AUTO [inaudible] NIELSEN WIENER [inaudible] I CURRENTLY ENJOYS A THREE ZERO VOTE WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE ROLE OF WE ARE ON THE HUNT NOW FOR EITHER SENATOR RUBIO. FOR SENATOR ALLEN.

ALL RIGHT HERE WE GO. LOW PRESSURE RELIEF OKAY GOING I'VE NEVER BEEN SO WELCOME TO THE GOVERNMENT TO FINANCE COMMITTEE IS A YOUNG MAN -- GENERALITIES MANY OF THE BLESSED US WITH HIS APPEARANCE OUTSIDE TODAY. WELL WE'VE BEEN. IN A RIP ROARING COMMITTEE ON THE U. Q. AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HAVING SIMILAR IN THE DREAM LIVING I SUPPOSE WE ARE. THERE'S A GENTLEMAN THERE WE HAD THE SENATOR HILL SHOW EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON WE ARE NOW ABOUT TO PRESENT THE SENATOR ALLEN-CHAU -- WE HAVE NOT TWO THREE WE HAVE FOR SENATOR ALLEN BILLS AND THEY ARE ALL GOOD ONES SO WHAT WE HAVE -- ITEM NUMBER THREE SB FORTY THREE WHICH WILL START WITH IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU CENTER OF ENTICING I APPRECIATE THAT. HEY THERE WE GO WE THEN HAVE THE ITEM NUMBER FOR SB FORTY FIVE WHICH WILL BE READING OUT AND THEN IS TO BE TAKEN INTO THE NEXT COMMITTEE IN HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. SIR ON THAT.

OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE IT SO LET ME WE START BY A COURSE THINKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND ALSO ACCEPTING THE THE OUT THE AMENDMENTS OUT THE AMENDMENT OUTLINED IN THIS ANALYSIS. I AND I CERTAINLY DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE HOUSES WHICH IS WHY YOU KNOW THE BILL MULTIPLE CALLS FOR STUDY. TENS ALL THESE QUESTIONS THIS IS A STUDY BALLOTS NOTHING MORE I MADE VERY FIRM COMMITMENTS I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO EXPAND IT -- THIS IS A STUDY BILL THIS IS THAT'S THAT'S WELL THIS BILL IS. I'M SO YOU KNOW EVERYONE RELAX. SB. FORTY THREE DOES IT WHAT IT DOES TO YOU WHAT IT DOES DO IS REQUIRE OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES. TO CONDUCT A STUDY EVALUATING -- SALES AND USE TAX AND REPLACE IT WITH A REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON TAXES THAT WOULD NOT BE A NET. TAX INCREASE ON THE POPULATION BUT WHAT IT WOULD DO IS BETTER ALIGN. POTENTIALLY BETTER. OUR OUR TAXATION SYSTEM TO MEET THE CARBON. GOALS THAT WE HAVE IN THE AND AND AND REFLECT THE B. S. THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS WITH REGARDS TO OUR OUR GREENHOUSE GAS. GOALS IN OUR POLLUTION GOALS IN OUR OUR OUR CLIMATE GOALS SO. YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR OUR CURRENT CABINETRY SYSTEM IS PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REDUCING EMISSIONS -- BUT IT IS. A RELATIVELY SMALL AND BY IMPLEMENTING A REVENUE NEUTRAL PRICING MECHANISM BASED ON THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. OF THE PRODUCTS SOLD AND CONSUMED IN THE STATE A DIRECT FINANCIAL BENEFIT IS OFFERED TO THOSE WHO CHOOSE THE BY PRODUCTS OF LOW EMISSIONS LOW CARBON INTENSITY. I THEN I THOSE WHO CHOOSE -- OTHERWISE WOULD BE ASKED TO PAY FOR THE IMPACTS. IN ADDITION A REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON TAX WOULD. FURTHER THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS SET BY THE STATE AS I MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW THAT. DID WITH CIGARETTES FOR EXAMPLE THEY'VE THEIR TAX IN NEARLY THREE DOLLARS THAT'S REDUCE SMOKING RATES SIGNIFICANTLY BUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO BUT IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING REVENUE NEUTRAL. ITEM THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE PURCHASING. LOW INTENSITY -- ITEMS OUT OF BE ABLE TO PAY LESS. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE SO. NOW THEY SAY IT'S A STUDY BILL. AND I SERIOUSLY MEAN IT WHEN I SAY THAT IF CARP COMES BACK TO US IN TAX AND FEE AND THEY SAY LOOK LOVE THE IDEA. BUT IT'S JUST TOO ON FEASIBLE HERE HERE THE REASONS WHY -- YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH IT'S A GREAT IDEA CONCEPTUALLY IT'S JUST TOO COMPLICATED OR TOO DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT. LET'S NOT PURSUE IT AT THE LAST THING I WANT IS A A BEAR OF A IMPLEMENTATION IT'S GONNA ROLL OUT POORLY IN UPSET EVERYBODY IN BE CONFUSING NOT. ULTIMATELY REACH OUR GOAL SO WE JUST WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WE WANT THEM TO COME BACK WITH US. IT WAS SOME IDEAS AND THOUGHTS AND AS THEY SAY IF THEY COME BACK AND SAY IT'S ON FEASIBLE WE'RE NOT GOING TO PURSUE IT -- AND SO WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MICHELLE CERRILLOS FROM NATURE CONSERVANCY ALSO I CHRISTINE SHOEMAKER FROM FOSSEL. POINT IN THEIR HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AGAIN I AM GRATEFUL TO THE SENATOR FOR TAKING A PRACTICAL APPROACH OF THIS AND TAKING A LOOK AT IT AND THEN -- IF DANCING A DATA DRIVEN STRATEGY AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WELL SO JUST WANNA I TAKE MOMENT SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE TO CENTER ALLEN ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THE TECH WILL TURN OVER TO TWO WITNESSES EACH WITNESS HAS TWO MINUTES WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A KICK ASSAD. ALL RIGHT IF YOU DON'T NâNG DISCLOSURE PERSON LAST NAME ORGANIZATION WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE THINKS RIGHT THANK YOU -- SHALL PASS THROUGH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND WE THANK SENATOR ALLEN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE -- AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD -- SENATE BILL -- FORTY THREE IS A STUDY BILL THAT PRIDE THE STATE WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THAT'LL INFORM US IN THE STATE ON HOW OTHER MECHANISMS FOR REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES EVEN FURTHER. AND AT THIS POINT WE NEED ALL THE INFORMATION WE CAN GET TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE MOST EFFECTIVELY. I AND THE SHOULD INCLUDE EXAM IN THE STATE'S HOUSING USE TAX AS A CENTRAL MECHANISM. LAST FALL THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE IF YOU'RE REPORT AROUND THE SPEAKING TO THE GLOBAL URGENCY OF BECOMING CARBON NEUTRAL IF NOT CARBON NEGATIVE BY MID CENTURY. TO KEEP OVERALL TEMPERATURES FROM RISING NO MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS I'M IN THIS REPORT FILED ON THE HEELS OF THE GLOBAL PARIS AGREEMENT WHERE. COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AGREED TO KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM RISING MORE THAN TWO DEGREES TO AVOID THE MOST CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THE CLIMB AFFRONT BUT WE DO NEED TO DO MORE. IF YOU WANT TO DO OUR PART AND ALSO HELP MEET. UP THAT KIND OF COMMITMENTS THAT WERE PLEDGED IN PARIS AND WELLS FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF THE I. P.. REPORT -- WE SEE SB FORTY THREE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE VIABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ANOTHER TOOL. TO HELP US IN THIS EFFORT TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND POTENTIALLY OUTSIDE OF OUR BORDERS CELEBRITY IN CALIFORNIA'S WORK -- AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE CHANGES THE SALES AND USE TAX CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU SO I THINK YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON MA'AM THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. SO CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRISTINE SHOEMAKER. I'M A RETIRED PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST IN A BOARD MEMBER OF PHILOSOPHY CALIFORNIA WHICH I'M REPRESENTING TODAY. AND ALSO FOR CALIFORNIA IS A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WAS SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED ONLINE SUPPORTERS IN OUR MISSION. OUR STATED MISSION IS TO WORK TO AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR CLIMATE DAMAGING FOSSIL FUELS AND TO PROMOTE A JUST TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY WE FEEL THIS BILL FITS WITH OUR MISSION. ON THE PROBLEM WE ARE ADDRESSING IS CLIMATE CHANGE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY SAID IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. THAT REQUIRES FAST DRAWDOWN OF FOSSIL FUEL USAGE AND WE REALLY NEED A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH FOR GOING TO LOWER OUR GREENHOUSE GASES. RAPIDLY ON THE BILL OFFERS A UNIQUE REPOSE APPROACH AS A CENTER EMPHASIZE THIS IS A STUDY BILL. BUT IT COULD LEAD IF IT WAS ENACTED TWO ONE SOLUTION TO LOWERING GREENHOUSE GASES. ARE BY A CARBON INTENSITY TAX THAT IF ENACTED COULD LOWER GREENHOUSE GASES BY DRIVING CHARGE OF CHANGES BY PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS. AND THIS IS A REPLACEMENT IT'S NOT A NEW TAX. ADDITIONALLY THE STUDY WILL LEAD TO IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON CARBON INTENSITY OF PRODUCTS. IN THE MARKET PLACE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY NEEDED AND THIS WOULD BE USEFUL FOR CONSUMERS LEGISLATORS REGULATORY REGULATORS ETCETERA AND COULD LEAD TO MAKING BETTER AND SMARTER -- ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS. WE WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR INCLUDING. AN AMENDMENT THAT RELATES TO ECONOMIC EQUITY IN THE STUDY THAT IS IT ADDS THAT THE STUDY. DURING THE IMPACTS OF A REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON INTENSITY TAX ON VARIOUS INCOME LEVELS AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST TRANSITION -- FINALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THIS COULD HELP FUTURE PROOF THE ECONOMY TO PREPARE BUSINESSES. OPERATING IN A LOW CARBON WORLD -- FINALLY WE WILL URGENT I VOTE TO EXPLORE UNIQUE MARKET BASED APPROACH TO LOWER GREENHOUSE GASES. AND ALSO GIVE NEEDED INFORMATION ON CARBON INTENSITY OF PRODUCTS. WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR ALLEN FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL AND INVITING US TO SPEAK WE THANK YOU. FOR LISTENING TO US THANK YOU SO MUCH OF A GROUP OF YOUR TESTIMONY.

YOU KNOW ASSOCIATED WITH WITH COMPETENCY BUT NO ALL THAT BEING SAID [inaudible] TAX AND IN VIEW MINISTRATION WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT ALL THE IMPLICATIONS IN ISSUES INCLUDING SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS. IMPACTS AND COME UP WITH A FORMULA THAT WE DID THE BOTH IS REFLECTIVE OF THE GOALS OF THE THE BILL. WHILE ALSO REFLECTING A NUMBER OF THE OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING FAIRNESS AND EQUITY AND MAKE SURE THIS IS A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN MORE. AND THE LAST ONE MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK IN TERMS WHAT I'M. MASSIVE SOME QUESTIONS ARE PROBABLY WOULD APPLY TO ANY KIND OF STUDY OF ANY -- ANOTHER GREAT DAY AT THE STATE. WHEN YOU DO A -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT A TAX I THINK? IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO MINISTER. COMPARED SO IF YOU WANTED. TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT. AND THEN YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE BUSINESS STANDPOINT. COM YEAH LIKE THE SALES TAX. THE FACT BUSINESS AND THEY HAVE TO DO. THAT KIND OF COLLECTION IN THE COLLECTION PROCESS AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE TAX. I THINK I THINK THE THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE TO TAXES THAT DON'T HAVE HIGH ADMINISTRATIVE OVER CAPSULES. ON THE OTHER HAND WE WANT TO BE FAIR. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE TAXES THAT ARE THIS. YES. SO BOTH TURNED. TO BOOK BOTH THE SECTION JUST AFTER THE ONE THAT I READY ABOUT LOW INCOME CONSUMERS SECTION EIGHT TALKS ABOUT -- YOU KNOW. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW TAX SYSTEM IDENTIFY THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS FOR COMPLIANCE. THE OTHER THING I'LL MENTION IS IT PAGE FOR THE HOUSE OF GOVERNMENT TO RIGHT TO THE GOVERNMENT. TO I'M SO THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO ADD INTO THE BILL I WOULD I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD ADDITION TO THAT I DON'T ANYMORE. I WILL SAY I THERE'S THE THE BOTTOM PAGE FOUR OF YOUR COMMITTEES ANALYSIS DOES TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THIS ISSUE IT SAYS CARBON TAXES REGIONAL CONSIDERED A MINISTRY USABLE AND REASONABLY SIMPLE. FOR AGENCIES TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE BECAUSE SOMEBODY LIKE ARE CURRENTLY REPORTED. TO THE USEPA SO THERE'S THERE'S ALREADY A WELL DEVELOPED STRUCTURE FOR COLLECTING. A DATE ON THIS AND AND IT TALKS ABOUT THIS ON WATER MORE THAN I HAD ONE MORE. YEAH PLEASE I'M LIKE COLUMBO MY LOVE AND MORE. YEAH. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS DID YOU LOOK AT SALES TAX AND? YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT DWELLING ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. RIGHT. THIS IS JUST A SALES IS JUST SELL STOCK OKAY. YEAH YOU'RE NOT GETTING INTO THAT WE FOLLOW IS QUITE A BIT LARGER THAN THE CAP AND TRADE YEAH YEAH. OKAY THANKS.

FEEL THAT THIS IS STUFF WE CAN WORK OUT AND IF IT'S A MATTER OF YOU KNOW THAT. KIND OF CALIBRATING THE ROLE THAT CARP PLAYS VERSES THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE AYE AYE I THINK THAT IS IT ABSOLUTELY THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE CAN HAVE -- SOME OF THE LOGISTICAL CONCERNS THEY HAVE AS WELL SO I THINK WE'RE GETTING. WE'RE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER I YOU KNOW I GET I MEAN ULTIMATELY IT'S TAX AND FEE THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE.

I DO APPRECIATE RENTS FORBEARANCE AND PATIENCE AND IN PARTICULAR THANKS TO THOSE WHO COME IN FROM OTHER PLACES TO TO BE HERE. SO. WITH THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT SB FORTY FIVE SO SO WE'VE ON WE'VE BEEN INTO COMMITTEES SO FAR THIS IS A TRIPLE REFERRED BILL. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT ANY IN PROGRESS OF SORTS BUT BUT A BOND OF THIS SIZE AND SCOPE. IS ABSOLUTELY WORK IN PROGRESS I I KNOW WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO TO FLESH OUT THE DETAILS. BUT THE IDEA IS THAT IF PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN THIS WOULD BASICALLY AUTHORIZED. OF THIS BOND ON THE BALLOT BUT IF PASSED BY THE VOTERS THIS WOULD FIND ON THE GROUND PROJECTS. DESIGNED TO HELP US PREPARE HELPLESS PREPARE FOR THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND OTHER IMPACTS THAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE EVERYTHING FROM SEVERE WILDFIRES CATASTROPHIC FLOODS IN MUSCLE MUD SLIDES. PROLONGED DROUGHTS EXTREME HEAT AND MORE. NOW WE KNOW THERE ENORMOUS IMPACTS THAT -- THE THAT ARE ARE ARE GOING TO BE METED UPON US. I THE LA ALWAYS JUST ESTIMATED THE POTENTIAL COST. OF THESE IMPACTS IN THE ORDER OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BILLION AND CENTURY NOTED OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR REST OF PROPERTY VALUE. RESULTING FROM JUST MODEST. LEVEL RISE ALONE. WE HAD A THERE'S AN INFORMATIONAL HEARINGON THE NEW ABNORMAL IN FIRE PRONE THEIR REGIONS THAT WE WE ALL HELD TOGETHER ROBERT SPENT IN THE REGION. NINE DIRECTOR ADMINISTRATOR FOR FEMALE HE SAID THAT EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED ACTIVITIES OF PREVENT FIRES. OR MITIGATE THEIR SEVERITY WE WE WILL SERVE WE WILL SAVE SIX DOLLARS AND RESPONSE AND YOU KNOW ANYBODY'S PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE BASICS OF THE DEBATE OVER THE FUTURE OF UTILITIES. AND FUTURE ENERGY ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE KNOWN HOW MUCH OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM IS FINANCIALLY AT RISK AS A RESULT. OF WILDFIRE IMPACT. SO THIS. THIS. BILL. I SUCH A COURSE TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS. OF RISING GLOBAL TEMPERATURES -- AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW WILL BE HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AS A RESULT MY INVESTING IN NECESSARY MEASURES TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES. AND OUR VITAL NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING CLIMATE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGHT THE THE THE THE SEVERITY AND THE REPEATEDLY WITH WHICH CLIMATE CHANGES BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS GOING TO BE CHANGING. IT ALREADY I CHANGING WE NEED TO BE MORE RESILIENT SO. I THE SB FORTY FIVE DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO PROJECTS THAT WILL REDUCE FIRE RISK IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. ONCE OUR FORESTS ARE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND MORE INTENSE WILDFIRES. OUR WARM TEMPERATURES OF COURSE ARE ALSO EXPECTED INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF BOTH LARGE SCALE SMALL SCALE FLOODS. I GET WE ARE INVESTING LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO PROPERLY DRESSED THOSE GROWING RISKS IT RELATES TO THE FLIGHTS WITH THE REPAIR OF EXISTING. LEVY AND DEFENSIVE FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE ALONE COSTING ESTIMATED. TO BE. MORE THAN THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF THE AREA OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IN FEAR AND CONCERN FOR ANYBODY WHO WORKS IN AND AROUND THE STATE CAPITAL IN SACRAMENTO IN A IN A FLOOD ZONE. I ASK YOU FORTY FIVE DEDICATES FUNDING A PROJECT THAT WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC FLOOD EVENTS BY SLOWING RUNOFF IMPROVING GROUND WATER FILTRATION IN PROTECTING. COASTAL COMMUNITIES FROM FROM SEA LEVEL RISE AND OF COURSE CALIFORNIA'S URBAN COMMUNITIES A NOT AT RISK FOR FIRE. NOT QUITE AS MUCH INTEREST FOR FIRE OR FLOOD. ARE STILL VULNERABLE TO A LOT OF OTHER IMPACTS REALLY THE CLIMATE CHANGE OR EXTREME HEAT EVENTS IT CAN BE DEADLY ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER ADULTS YOUNG CHILDREN. PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY AND AND SO THE BILL ALSO DIRECTS MONEY TO HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES ADAPT TO RISING TEMPERATURES BY RELEASED REDUCING HEAT ISLAND. A FACT IN OUR CITIES THE GREENING PROJECTS AND CAPTION STORM WATER TO HELP STABILIZE. DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES AND THE MEASURE ALSO PREFERS PROPOSES FINES ADD TO PROTECT WETLANDS IN WATER WAYS WATERSHEDS. SO IT'S OUR STRONG FEELING WE HAVE TO TAKE AGGRESSIVE PROACTIVE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THE THAT WHICH WE KNOW IS COMING. HI THIS BILL IS ONE STEP IN THAT EFFORT AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY KIM SNYDER WHOSE. REPRESENTS CINEMA COUNTY WATER AGENCY AND ALSO REGARDLESS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH WHO THAT KICKS OFF GOOD AFTERNOON SIR GOOD TO SEE YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND.

THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE ACTUALLY LIKE IN THIS BILL MORE THAN OTHERS JUST OUR FAVORITES IF YOU WILL THAT WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT TODAY. THERE'S A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR REGIONAL CLIMATE RESILIENCY. THAT'S EXCITING TO US BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY WORK WITH SOME OF THE REGIONAL COLLABORATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE'RE VERY EXCITED WITH THE MONEY IN THERE FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE THINK THAT'S GONNA BE VERY USEFUL TO SOME THE CONSERVATION CORES BUT ALSO. THE CIVIC SPARK AMERICORPS PROGRAM THAT WE WORK WITH. AND CLEARLY THE MONEY TO DEAL WITH WILD FIRE RISK AND SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR NATURAL RESOURCES. IS SUPER IMPORTANT. FINALLY WE ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED.

BEATING SPENDING MONEY IN ADVANCE TO REDUCE THE LIKELY IMPACTS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE WILL MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE RESILIENT. AS A LOCAL AGENCY WE LACK THE FUNDS TO TACKLE THISPROBLEM.

I AM NOT GOING TO SAY ONE THING. IN OPPOSITION WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. EVERYTHING IN IN THE IN THE BOND. NOT GONNA I'M NOT GONNA CRITICIZE. ONE THANK IN THE BOND. I'M ONLY A SAY. DATA IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE FIVE OF THE STAFF REPORT. THE TEN LARGEST STATES WERE WERE AT THE BOTTOM. THE THIRD FROM THE BOTTOM END. YOU KNOW ONE OF MY GOALS IS THE STATE'S SENATORS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT BECOME ILLINOIS. IN ILLINOIS IS LITERALLY AT THE BOTTOM AND WITH MULTIPLES THAT. THE DATA IS THERE IN THIS IN THIS DATA SHOWS UP IN EVERY STAFF REPORT. BOND MEASURE [inaudible] TO THE STATE'S UNRESTRICTED NET POSITION CURRENTLY IS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT POINT. FIVE AS OF JUNE. THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE [inaudible] THIRTY EIGHTEEN IN ITS APRIL. TWENTY BUT WHAT IS TODAY. FOUR TWENTY FOURTHS APRIL TWENTY FOURTH. HAD SAID TEN MONTHS. AGO WE STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT AND I THINK PART OF THE REASON SENATOR ALLEN IS THAT. ARE OUR WORST PROBABLY WAITING FOR THE ACTUARIAL REPORT ON WHAT OUR RETIREE MEDIC. LAST YEAR WAS NINETY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AND THAT HAS TO BE ADDED. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE A STATE THAT HAS A QUARTER TRILLION. UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT SO. WE DON'T NEED MORE DATA WE'RE READY. IT WILL END IN IN BIG NUMBERS THIS BOND WILL PROBABLY BE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION A YEAR THERE'S NO WHERE IN THE STAFF REPORT THIS IS WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS WILL BE. THEY'LL COME OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO PUSH SOMETHING ELSE OUT WHETHER. YOU KNOW. YOU CAN NAME ALL THE GREAT PROGRAMS WERE TRYING TO DO HELPING THE MENTALLY ILL WHATEVER IT IS. SOMETHING'S GONNA GET PUSHED OUT. AND LASTLY JUST. DOES A WORD OF CAUTION. WE HAVE AN INVERTED YIED CURVE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SINCE LIKE. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BUT UC INDICATES A RECESSION IS COMING AND THE INVERTED YIELD CURVE IN THE BOND MARKET HAS BEEN RIGHT ABOUT. EVERY TIME FOR SIXTY YEARS SO. I'M SAYING THAT MAYBE THE TIMING FOR A BOND ISN'T RIGHT ALL ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE ANY DISAGREEMENT OR I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THE PROCEEDS. I'M JUST CONCERNED FOR THE FINANCIAL WELL BEING OF THE STATE WHAT THAT. COULD MEAN GOING FORWARD SO THAT'S WHY. I I SURE THOSE CONCERNS AND ONE OF THANK CHAIRMAN AND AND THE AUTHOR FOR MY BEING ABLE TO THESE EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS NO. ALWAYS LOVE IT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SURVEYS CHAIR. SURROUND YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. WELL LOOK VERY. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE SAID. NOW I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS. I THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS ARE. ALSO HI. AND THAT -- ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS TAKE ONE LOOK AT THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE WILDFIRES. ON OUR ECONOMY HONOR UTILITY SYSTEM. I ON PROPERTY VALUES ON INSURANCE MARKETS. ARE THERE REAL DOWNSIDES NOT ACTING TO BUT THERE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS A DELICATE BALANCE. AND I'VE ALWAYS RESPECTED YOUR AND YOUR COMMITMENT. TO TO FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND AND I I I I I TOTALLY EVEN REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU VOTE TODAY I WOULD LOVE. TO TO TALK TO YOU WORK WITH YOU ON AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT. IS REALLY DOES BECOME A A GOOD VALUE PROPOSITION THE STATE. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS NOT ABOUT JUST GOING OFF AND SPENDING. ON STUFF THAT THE NECESSARY THIS IS ACTUALLY GONE ABOUT GOING ON THE SPENDING SO THAT. WE WILL HAVE. LESS OF A FINANCIAL IMPACT IN VARIOUS RESPECTS IN THE FUTURE -- BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE LOOKING WITH AN EAGLE EYE. AT THESE DEBT. TO GDP DUCTED TO PERSONAL INCOME RATIOS I THINK THE ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. I AND YOU KNOW TO BE HONEST THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE. A DISCUSSION AT THE HIGH HIGHEST LEVELS -- WITH AND THE LEADERSHIP. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE LEADERS OF BOTH HOUSES TO REALLY DETERMINE. WHETHER THIS GETS UP TO THE LEVEL THAT IT'S WORTH INCURRING SOME MORE DEBT [inaudible] I TO YOU KNOW TO TO BE ABLE TO MEET THESE KINDS OF FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. WE'RE GONNA PUT TOGETHER I GUESS HERE'S MY HERE'S MY THING THOUGH SENATOR. LAST YEAR THERE WAS A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT THAT ALMOST PASSED. I THAT WAS A KIND OF A PAY TO PLAY [inaudible] THREE BOND. I REALLY NO WATER. THAT A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS WERE IN A VERY REAL QUANDARY AS TO WHETHER THE SUPPORTER NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE SOME GOOD STUFF IN THERE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT ALSO -- WAS. YOU KNOW. HELLO TRANSACTIONAL ABOUT HOW IT ALL CAME TOGETHER. AND IT END UP LOSING BUT YOU KNOW OUR WHOLE SYSTEM IS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE. TO MANIPULATION BY OUT. EDU THERE'S ONE TIME THERE'S A BOND THAT ONE GUY PUT ON THE BALLOT OF A MEASURE JUST TO BASICALLY FIND HIS OWN BUSINESS. I'M SO WE WILL WE WANTED TO HEAR WAS GONNA TAKE CHARGE OF THE CONVERSATION. SEVENTY ONE AND YOU HAVE COME UP WITH A WITH A MEASURE THAT ACTUALLY WAS LIMITED IN SIZE. YOU KNOW I KNOW LOOKS BIG BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SMALLER THAN. SOME OF THE PRESSURE WE'RE GETTING WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE OF EVERYONE TURNS IN TO THE BIGGEST CHRISTMAS. OUR BUT ONE THAT IS LIMITED IN SIZE AND REALLY. FOCUSED ON VALUE FOR MONEY. I WHILE ALSO HAVING THE PAST POLITICAL MUSTER THAT THAT'S KIND OF THAT THE THE DIFFICULT BALANCE IN GETTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO ON I DON'T DISAGREE WITH SINGLE THING YOU SAID AND I SHARE THOSE CONCERNS. I REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IF WE DO PUT SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT IT'S THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF IT BEING A IN PERFECT BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT YET. STRONG AND HELPFUL AND PRODUCTIVE WAY OF ADDRESSING THESE LONG TERM LIABILITIES THAT WE KNOW THE STATE IS GOING TO FACE. AND IF WE WERE IN A PERFECT WORLD SENATOR ALLEN. WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS. MASSIVE DEFICIT WE'D HAVE A CASH POSITION AND WE'LL BE GIVING YOU THE FOR A BILLION LIKE THAT SAID TODAY THAT I KNOW IT TODAY. AS OPPOSED TO PAYING MAYBE EIGHT BILLION OVERALL FOR ALL THESE PROJECT WITH THE INTEREST COSTS. SO I'M I'M I GET I GET THE PASSION I GUESS. I'M JUST. RIGHT IS THERE TO HOW WE BALANCE IT ALL SO THAT WE DON'T LEAVE OUR KIDS. WITH THE YOU KNOW MASSIVE. DAD AND AND AND WE ARE THEY'LL BE IN YOUR FROM THE SCHOOL INDUSTRY. SCHOOL DISTRICT SERVES. I MEAN THEIR BALANCE SHEETS ARE AWFUL. YES LEVY EL UNIFIED ON DOWN SO I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY OKAY HOW DO WE WHEN IT ALL COMES IN OUR FRONT PORCH HOW DO WE DEAL WITH IT YEAH.

NO WORRIES NO WORRIES IT'S ALL GOOD. YEAH IT WILL IT WILL SO WE'LL WAIT TO HAVE THE TO MAKE THAT MOTION HERE IN JUST A BIT -- IN VERY GRATEFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH WE ARE MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS SB. ONE THIRTY NINE IT'S RELATED TO INDEPENDENT REGISTERING COMMISSIONS WE WELCOME A TESTIMONY. TO COME FORWARD CENTER ALLEN. THE FLOOR IS YOURS [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH  REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT REVERSE DISCUSSION IN AND THIS IS A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE VERY DIFFERENT -- ONE BUT CERTAINLY ONE THAT IMPACTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN A SUBSTANTIVE WAY AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT. NGUYEN. BROADER SUPPORT SO I'M FIRST AYE AYE I WILL COMMIT TO TAKING THE TACKLE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE HOUSES AS WELL AS AS ON DEMAND THAT REALLY REQUIRES ITS. COUNTY SO THAT'S SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND OR FEWER. NOT THAT SMALL BUT BUT CERTAINLY SMALLER COUNTIES ESTABLISH A COMMISSION CONTINGENT APPROPRIATIONS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I I I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN OF THE OF THE OF THE CHAIR -- BECAUSE IN. A SMALL COUNTY AS FAR BUDGET AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE. HOW YOU HAVE BEEN IMPACTED AT A DISPROPORTIONATELY AS A RESULT OF THIS REQUIREMENT? AND WHAT IS A GROW BASICALLY THE REQUIREMENT. REQUIRES COUNTIES WITH MORE THAN. TWO FIFTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT DISTRICT COMMISSION. ENSURING A MORE FAIR NONPARTISAN SYSTEM FOR DRAWING THE LINES. OF COUNTY SUPERVISORS ORIEL DISTRICTS HELP FOLKS KNOW THAT AND BEGINNING WITH THE THE PROOF WILL OF PROP ELEVEN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WE'VE BEEN DRAWN ALLIANCE BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CITIZEN. REDISTRICTING COMMISSION THE CRC IT'S AN INDEPENDENT. REGISTERED COMMISSION AND AND WE'VE NOW. THEY THEY'VE BEEN DRAW THE LINES FOR THE ASSEMBLY FOR THE SENATE FOR THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR DISTRICT. LINES WERE DRAWN UP BY. THE CITIZENS OUR DISTRICT MISSION INDEPENDENT REGISTERED COMMISSION. I THERE'S BEEN A SURGEON INTERESTED IN THIS I SINCE WE DID THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND WE PASSED BOTH SB ELEVEN AWAIT IN JUST SIXTEEN IN SB TEN EIGHTEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BOTH MY BILLS. THOSE BILLS AUTHORIZE ALL COUNTY CITIES. SCHOOL COMMUNICATIONS SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT HYBRID. OR ADVISORY RISEN COMMISSION. THE WATER PERMISSIVE IN JURISDICTIONS CAN CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT REDUCING COMMISSIONS. I WHILE MANY LOCATE LOCALITIES HAVE FAIR TRANSPARENT REGION PROCESSES. GERRYMANDERING HAS CONTINUED IN SOME JURISDICTIONS. AND DONE. YOU KNOW. THE IDEA HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW I I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT THE SYSTEM IS BETTER WHEN INCUMBENTS DON'T TRY OTHER ONLINE AS PAINFUL AS IT IS AND WE'RE ABOUT TO GO INTO RESTORING PROCESS AND THAT -- THAT MOUSE HOUSE CAN IMPACT ALL OF US A LITTLE SCARY FOR ANYWAY. INCUMBENT. BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT -- THIS CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE I JUST THINK IT'S FAIR -- IT WAS SUCH A POLITICAL PROCESS IN A TALK ANY THE OLD TIMERS REAR AT THE TIME THAT WE WE USE THE REDISTRICTING HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND AYE AYE AYE EVERYONE WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S A BETTER SYSTEM NOW [inaudible] I'M SO. WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED PRAYER BILLS REQUIRE LA IN SENIOR COUNTY SUIT OPTIONS HAVE BEEN IT REGISTRY COMMISSIONS. AND I JUST WANT EXTEND THAT REQUIREMENT. TO THE OTHER LARGE COUNTIES TAKE GERRYMANDERING OUT OF REDISTRICTING. THE KEY THING HERE IS A BILL REQUIRES INDEPENDENT DISHING COMMISSION HAS PASSED OUT FULL POWER TO DRAFTING DOT MAPS INDEPENDENT OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. ARE THE THE BILL REQUIRES THE COMMISSION MEMBERS TO BE POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT. FOR THE FIRST TIME IT PROHIBITS PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING IN COUNTY REDISTRICTING -- YOU KNOW IT ALSO HAS SOME RULES ABOUT ABOUT -- TRIP TRANSPARENCIES OF THE MAPS HAVE TO BE PUBLISHED BEFORE ADOPTION HAVE TO BE AT LEAST FIVE PUBLIC HEARINGS PRIOR TO ADOPTING ANY MAPS.

BECAUSE I DON'T WITH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR RESCUE ONE THIRTY NINE TO ENSURE A FAIR AND INDEPENDENT COUNTY REDUCING PROCESS. CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTIES NOW WHEN IT COMES TO STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING CALIFORNIA'S DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. ELIMINATE GERRYMANDERING CALIFORNIA STATE CITIZEN REDISTRICTING COMMISSION IS CONSIDERED THE NATIONAL GOLD STANDARD. REDUCING REFORM BY MANY ACADEMICS AND GOOD GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS. THIS BILL EXTENDS A BEST PRACTICE OF INDEPENDENT REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTIES. THEIR NUMBER REASONS FAVOR INDEPENDENT REDUCING FIRST COMMISSIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO KEEP COMMUNITIES INTACT INCLUDING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE A MORE REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. SECOND COMMISSIONS CONSTRUCTION WITH PROTECTION CENTER COMMISSION PARTIALITY. ARE LESS LIKELY TO DRAW LINES TO CHIEF POLITICAL OR PARTISAN ENDS. AND FINALLY REDUCING COMMISSIONS ALSO TEND TO PROMOTE PUBLIC TRUST. SELECT FISHEL'S BROTHER ON DISTRICTS IT CAN CREATE THE RISK OR JUST THE PERCEPTION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST ELECTED OFFICIAL MIGHT USE PROCESS. PRIMARILY BENEFIT THEIR OWN REELECTION. PUTTING THE SP ONE THIRTY NINE TEXAS. WORKED AT THE STATE LEVEL AND PAN REDUCING AND EXTENDS IT DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS BILL CORPORATE MONEY THE BEST IN PRACTICE STANDARDS FOR FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY. PROMOTED BY GOOD GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE COMMON CAUSE AND WE JUST TO CONCLUDE WE THINK IN A PEN REDUCING AS FOSTER IS FIRMLY TAKEN ROOT IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING. WITH FOR COUNTIES AS A TWENTY TWENTY REDUCING CYCLE PERCHES WE THINK IT'S TIME TO EXTEND THIS IMPORTANT DEMOCRATIC PROTECTION TOLD CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE COUNTIES. THESE REASONS WE'RE TONIGHT THANK YOU SHE WORK IN THE STORE FOR SURE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU DOOR ROSALIE WHO THERE IS A CALIFORNIA. THE FIGHT FOR AN INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE LOCAL LEAGUES ARE ARE. VERY ENGAGED IN THE MOVEMENT TO BRING INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION THERE REALLY THOSE LOCAL LEAGUES ARE REALLY IN THE TRENCHES DOING THE WORK OF FINDING COMMISSIONERS. WHO REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE WORKING IN? OF IT DURING THIS MAP DRAWING THEMSELVES SUBMITTING THAT THE CELLS AND ALSO. REALLY WORKING TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY MAKING SURE THAT THOSE THAT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ROBUST. AND DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL. AND THAT THE FOLKS WERE DRAWING THE LINES ARE REALLY LISTENING. SO. WHEN A LEGISLATIVE BODY DRAWS ITS OWN LINES THERE'S ALWAYS A TEMPTATION TO DRAW THEM IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS GOING TO EITHER HELP OR HURT INCUMBENTS OR POTENTIAL NEW MEMBERS COMING ON BOARD? THAT'S JUST. IT'S THE WAY IT HAPPENS WORK TO PRESERVE -- POLITICAL CONTROL IN ONE POLITICAL PARTY. THESE AREN'T ABSTRACT CONCERNS THEY ARE THEY HAVE AN ALL TOO OFTEN SO WE BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO TAKE THIS NEXT STEP TIME TO ENACT BILLING SB ONE THIRTY NINE THAT'S THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP. VOTERS WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT TO COUNTY SUPERVISORS. SUPERVISOR WHO REFLECTS THE INTERESTS THEIR COMMUNITIES. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THAT ELECTIONS ARE CLEAN FIGHTS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT WE'RE A MAJORITY MINORITY STATE BUT THAT DIVERSITY IS WOEFULLY UNDERREPRESENTED AMONG OUR COUNTY SUPERVISORS SO BY FIXING THE WAY THAT WE TO DRAW THE LINES WE ARE GOING TO TAKE IT ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE WAY WE DO IT AND MANY OF OUR ELECTION. REFORMS TO REALLY ACHIEVING A A MORE REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE SO WE ASK YOUR YES VOTE AS TO ONE THIRTY NINE THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR ARE YOU WORKING FOR YOUR TESTING TODAY END.

IF YOU DON'T MIND GIVING US YOUR FIRST LAST NAME ORGANIZATION THE FLOOR IS YOURS [inaudible] YES PLEASE. HI TRICIA WEBER I AM THE CO CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLARK AND ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE CA CEO. WHEN CAN I AM I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT I'M I'D LIKE TO THINK -- AND BECAUSE SPONSORS AND FOR ALL YOUR HELP -- AND LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS AND FOR ADDRESSING SOME OF THEM IN THE APRIL ELEVENTH AMENDMENT. I ALSO WANT TO STATE THAT WE ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION OF THE POLICY OF THE BILL IT'S MORE OF THE PROCEDURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. I'M OUR MAIN CONCERNS HAVE TO DO WITH THE ELECTION OFFICIALS. PLACED IN THE POSITION. TO AND OVERSEE THE PROCESS OF CREATING THIS COMMISSION NOT NECESSARILY PICKING THE COMMISSION BUT PICKING THE SCREENING -- TEAM AND THEN -- CORRECT TAKING ALL THE APPLICATIONS AND QUALIFYING THEM IN ORDER TO BE. PART OF THE APPLICANT POOL. THE TIMING OF THIS IS KIND OF CRUDE OF A CRITICAL TO OUR THOUGHTS BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING IN SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THE EXACT TIME THAT WE WILL BE RUNNING. THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT'S TIME OPEN AS TO WHEN WE CAN DO IT EVEN EARLIER IN THE YEAR OF TWENTY TWENTY IS STILL DEALING WITH -- THE PRIMARY ELECTION THE VOTER MAINTENANCE THAT HAPPENS AFTER THE ELECTION AND THEN THE PREPARATION FOR THE NOVEMBER WHICH IS NOT JUST THE PRESIDENTIAL BUT IT'S ALL OF THE LOCAL. OFFICES SCHOOLS AND STUFF SO IT'S A HEAVY TIME FOR CANDIDATE FINALLY -- SO THIS PUTS AN UNDUE BURDEN ON THE OFFICE -- AND WE WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO HIRE MORE STAFF. AND MAYBE MORE SPACE WHO KNOWS TO CONDUCT THE REGULAR FUNCTIONS OF THE ELECTION REMEMBERING THAT NOT ALL ELECTION OFFICES ARE SOLELY FOR ELECTIONS THERE OFTEN COMBINED. WITH RECORDER COUNTY CLERK AND OTHER FUNCTIONS. I'M. I'M THERE'S ALSO A QUESTION THAT WE HAVE REGARDING THE APPLICATION PROCESS ITSELF. ON WHEN WE ACTUALLY SCREEN IS -- AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE UP WE'VE EXPRESSED THIS TO AUTHORS OFFICE. I'M AND WE'RE GONNA WORK ON THAT LANGUAGE AND ALSO ON THE APRIL ELEVENTH AMENDMENT BROUGHT IN A PARTISAN ISSUE MEANING THAT THE COMMISSION IS. TO BE PROPORTIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REGISTER THE REGISTRATIONS ON A PARTY OR NO PARTY -- WHICH IS KIND OF WEIRD FOR THE ELECTIONS OFFICE. TO NOT WE CAN CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE REGISTERED AND HAVE BEEN FOR FIVE YEARS BUT NOW ALL OF THIS AND THAT BECOMES A PARTISAN ISSUE FOR A VERY NON PARTISAN OFFICE. TO USE AS ONE OF THE SCREENING MECHANISMS IN ON THE PROCESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH GONNA BE HANGING THERE IN HIS TO A CASE WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSITION. TO CREATE YOUR FIRST MASS IN THE ORGANIZATION WELCOME SIR OUT MAYBE IN BETWEEN WE HAVE CONCERNS. AS OUR AS OUR LEAD TO POINT OUT JEFF DEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. WELL I WANT TO THANK THE CENTER ALAMEDA IS A I THOUGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WERE PHILOSOPHICALLY OPPOSED TO BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS I JUST WANT OUTLINED A COUPLE OF THEM HERE. AND ONE IS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WHEN THE STATE REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WAS CREATED IT TOOK THE PROCESS FROM A PARTISAN BODY TO ONE THAT WAS. MORE EVENLY PARTISAN BUT IN THE CASE OF KIND OF SUPERVISORS. I WELL IT IS TAKING IT OUT OF SELF INTERESTED HANDS IS ACTUALLY TAKING WHAT IS CURRENTLY A NONPARTISAN OFFICE ALL AS YOU GUYS KNOW ALL LOCAL OFFICES ARE NONPARTISAN. AND PUT IT IN HANDS OF A BODY THAT IS APPOINTED BASED ON THEIR PARTY PREFERENCE -- AND SO THAT'S NOT AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH. CONSIDERING AND THE THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COMMISSION MEMBERS TO BE ARE FORTUNATE TO THE AS THAT. AS MS WEBER POINTED OUT TO THE PARTY REGISTRATION OF THE COUNTY -- BUT IT ALSO DISALLOWS THE A MAJORITY OF THE COMMISSION TO BE MADE UP OF ANYONE PARTY AND THERE ARE SEVERAL COUNTIES WHERE YOU CAN'T DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS AND SO IN THOSE CASES WHAT WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT EXTRA MEMBER. WHO WHO DO WE GIVE IT -- TO IF WE WE EITHER HAVE TO MAKE IT NON PROPORTIONAL OR WE HAVE TO GIVE A MAJORITY TO A SINGLE PART. SO I I JUST THAT SOMETHING WORTH CONSIDERING GETTING NOT NOT OF A REASON TO BE OPPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. I WE WOULD ALSO BRING UP THE POINT THAT WAS RAISED ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS -- THE THE THE WITH THE CURRENT -- ALLOWANCE PERMISSION IN STATUTE. LOCAL AGENCIES TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION GIVES QUITE A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THIS COMMISSION MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED -- AND IT WAS UNCLEAR TO US IN THE BILL BECAUSE THERE ARE FEW NOT WITHSTANDING -- THAT KIND OF COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER WHETHER THAT FLEXIBILITY IS ALLOWED OR NOT WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING. ANY OTHER LAW TAKES PRECEDENT OVER THE OTHER THE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS -- THAT'S PERFECT YOU'RE HAS EXACTLY. AND SO -- WE WOULD APPRECIATE IF IF WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT PLEDGE ABILITY DOES STAY HOME BECAUSE WE LIKE FLEXIBILITY GENERALLY WE STRETCH EVERY MORNING. M.. AND THEN THE LAST THING OF COURSE IS THE COST CENTER THAT'S PARTLY -- TAKING CARE OF IN THE AMENDMENTS -- BUT IN FACT YOU KNOW FOUR TO FIVE COUNTIES ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO REGAIN THEIR PRE RECESSION DISCRETIONARY REVENUE LEVEL INCLUDING SOME OF THE BIGGEST -- COUNTIES IN FACT ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST REVENUE LOSERS AFTER THE RECESSION SO WE JUST. LIKE TO CONTINUE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT FACT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO KNOW YOU'RE GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH REALLY QUICKLY HERE THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THE PERSPECTIVE YOU SEE SACK AND THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR. THANKS VERY SEE IF THERE IS ANYONE ELSE WHO'S IN OPPOSITION OR SQUISHY AT THIS TIME LAST CALL. ALL RIGHT WE'D LIKE TO HELP BRING IT BACK OUT HERE TO COMMITTEE WE LIKE THE FIRST TURN OVER TO THE GOOD SENATOR TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERN YEAH I KNOW I FOR SHE THAT AM I LET ME START BY SAYING -- IT'S INTERESTING THE MOST THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED SO FAR HAVE. COME OUT OF THE PARTY PREFERENCE ISSUE. AS FOLKS EVEN FARMS BONO THERE WAS NOTHING HAVING TO A PARTY PREFERENCE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS BILL. AND IT WOULD STILL BE MY INTENT. I WOULD PREFER IS KEEP THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL IN THAT RESPECT. IT WAS IN A MAN THAT WAS ASKED OF US IN ELECTIONS COMMITTEE. NOW THAT BEING SAID. IN MY CONVERSATION WITH THE ELECTIONS CHAIR I THINK THERE IS A GOOD DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY. I AND THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH US ON THAT LANGUAGE. BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I MEAN OUR FRIENDS IN COMMON CAUSE IN PARTICULAR. YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO IN TRYING. I EIGHTY DEGREE OF PARTISANSHIP INTO THE LAW. I WILL SAY TO CORRECT THERE YOU JUST A THE RECORD. THE RULE IS INTERESTING IT SAYS THAT THE V. PARTY FROM TEST BE PROPORTIONAL. BUT NO INDIVIDUAL PARTY. COULD HAVE A MAJORITY. SO EVEN IN A KIND OF LIKE ALAMEDA. WHERE THERE'S A STRONG DEMOCRATIC? REGISTRATION MAJORITY. HI THERE COULD NOT BE A DEMOCRATIC. ON THE REGISTRY COMMISSION. NOW THAT WOULD YOU COULD YOU COULD HAVE A TO THE TO SAID THAT THAT WOULD HAVE TO THEN BE DISTRIBUTED BASICALLY TO TO KNOW PARTY PREFERENCE VOTES. FOR OTHERS. SO I'M. SIMILARLY IN A HEAVILY REPUBLICAN DISTRICT YOU'D HAVE YOU KIND OF HAVE AN INTERESTING. I MIX WITH THE IDEA IS THAT THE BEHALF HE PROPORTIONAL BUT THE NO. ONE TYPE BY THE REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT NO PARTY PREFERENCE COULD HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE ADDITION COMMISSION AND AND THAT WAS ONE WAY THAT I THINK WE WE FELT LIKE WE ARE MAINTAINING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF FAIRNESS. WHILE ALSO MEETING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF OF PROPORTIONALITY SO THAT YEAH SO THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE MANIPULATION OF MAY I WILL SAY IN THE OF THE DAY YOU KNOW THE THE YOU KNOW. THE THE THE FOLKS RUNNING THE COUNTY ARE. ARE -- DID YOU ANSWER TO ELECTED BOARDS AND AND YOU KNOW BOTH ON THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN SITE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COULDN'T. NEITHER SIDE COULD JUST. STUFF THE THE COMMITTEE FULL OF FOLKS FROM THEIR POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE SO. I I DIDN'T LOVE THE CHANGE BUT THE SAME TIME I ACTUALLY GET WAS ELEGANTLY CONSTRUCTED. IN A WAY TO ADDRESS THE COR CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED I WILL SAY WITH REGARD SENATE HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TIMELINE ISSUES. I'M. WE DO ACTUALLY GIVE A MORE FLEXIBLE IN THE COUNTIES UNDER THIS BUILDING LA WAS GIVEN UNDER THE BILL LAST YEAR. I AND I WILL SAY THE NOTHING STOPS YOU FROM GETTING GOING EARLIER I MEAN PART OF WHAT WE WANTED TO DO THE BILL NOW. AND GET IT DONE EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER. I WAS SO AS TO GIVE THE COUNTIES IF IT WERE TO PASS WE GIVE THE COUNTIES THE HEADS UP THEY COULD START THE PROCESS IMMEDIATELY. SO THAT SO AS NOT TO HAVE TO BACK UP TO THE ELECTION SEASON WHICH IS A WHICH IS THE WHICH CERTAINLY A AN ISSUE I UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING GONE BEEN THE ELECTIONS CHAIR AND HAVING. SPENT A LOT OF TIME I'M HERE WITH SOME OF YOUR FOOT. SO. BUT THAT BEING SAID I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH OKAY SALE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE FOLKS FROM SEIZE ACTED TO JUST REFER. TRY TO MAKE IT WORKABLE I MEAN ULTIMATELY THIS IS. IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING WORKABLE FOR FOLKS IN AND LET'S ALL SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT REALLY WORK. THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND IF YOUR BILL IS WORKING HARD TO MAKE IT. WORK BUT THE REASON WHY WE FOCUSED ON THE CLERKS ELECTED OFFICIALS BECAUSE THEY REALLY ARE THE INDEPENDENT. RESPECTED NONPARTISAN FOLKS IN IN THE GAME RIGHT THERE THEY'RE NOT ELECTED OFFICIALS. THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN PARTISANSHIP. ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE A HIGHLY RESPECTED INDEPENDENT PLAYER. IN OUR GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE AND THAT'S WHY WE WANTED THEM TO BE RUNNING POINT. ON THE PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SELECTION FOR THE REDUCING COMMISSIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE ABOVE REPROACH. AND THEN IT'S IS THIS IS THIS IS THE THE PUNISHMENT YOU GET FOR BEING ABOVE REPROACH. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'D LIKE TO BE TO SEE WITH THE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. QUICK RESPONSE ANY ITEMS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE UNDERSTAND THAT AND WITH THAT WE TURN OVER TO COMMITTEE. NO. OTHER THAN AND WE JUST LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM. TO THE MILK. AND AREA THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION -- AND OR A MOTION FROM THE COMMISSION. WE DO HAVE SOME CONSIDERATION ANIMOTION RIGHT. I WILL MOVE AND I WILL DISCUSS ALL RIGHT THERE WE GO. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS OVER THE YEARS I JUST THINK FOR THE RECORD IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY YOU KNOW I I REALLY THINK THIS IS GREAT I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS SOME. ISSUES IS TRYING TO SCRUB THE STUFF AND GETTING IT RIGHT BUT THESE CAMINO ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED. EVER SINCE CONGRESSMAN JERRY CAME UP WITH THE DRAWING OF CONGRESSIONAL LINES AND WE CAME UP WITH THE STERN CALLED GERRYMANDERING. ARMED IT'S BEEN A GREAT CHALLENGE IN ON MY OLD ROLE I I DID THIS STUFF AND IT. IT REALLY IS PROBLEMATIC AND BOTTOM LINE IS COMING UP WITH ANY PROCESS THAT INSPIRES CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT. AND AND WE CERTAINLY ALL OF US NOW HERE TODAY IN THIS LEGISLATURE'S RESULT OF THIS SIMILAR TYPE PROCESS. AND SO YOU KNOW I I'VE FOUGHT FOR THIS STUFF AND AGAINST MY OWN PARTY OF THREE FOUR TIMES AND IT WAS HARD AND AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING. IS EASY BUT IT SHOULD GIVE YOU A LOTOF CREDIT FOR I THANK YOU LOOKING FOR BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS THING BUT I I WANT TO MOVE THE BILL. TO GIVE YOU A LOT OF CREDIT FOR BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THESE QUIET THINGS. IT'S A PROCESS OF GOVERNMENT THAT PEOPLE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT ARE THE THE THINGS THAT INSPIRE CONFIDENCE THAT WE DON'T RUN AROUND AND SAY LIKE WE SEE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS ALL MY GOD SOMEBODY'S JR AMENDING THIS GERMINATING THAT. AND THESE PROCESSES WORK THE LAST POINT -- SHARES THE REASON THEY PARTICULARLY WORKERS WHICH FROM THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. ARMED TO THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT CASE AFTER CASE AFTER CASE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ENGAGING. AND I THINK REALLY SCRUBBING THE ISSUE. OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES OF ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WE DEAL WITH REDISTRICTING. AND I HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE OF THESE PROCESSES WORK AND CERTAINLY YOU'VE DONE THIS THE RIGHT WAY SO AGAIN I I DO SEE ABSOLUTELY. A MOVE THIS AND THANK YOU FOR A INTRODUCING AND THE PROSECUTING THIS MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER MAJORITY LEADER WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR. THIS HAS A DO PASSES A MINIATURE PREPARATION. I THOUGHT -- TURNED THE LIGHT ON THAT WOULD. I I SAW YOU SURVEYS CHAIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS I'M SORRY MR JR. I'M. MAYBE I COULD GIVE THE OPPOSITE. CONCERNS FROM HAVING SERVED AS A SUPERVISOR. I COUNTY SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I I SEE THAT IT LIKE YOU THINK ABOUT. THE FIRST IS -- YOU DID SB ELEVEN OH EIGHT AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND I VOTED FOR THAT BILL. AND THAT'S PERMISSIVE RIGHT BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED. YEAH SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN -- IF IT HAD A GOOD TRACK RECORD. WE JUST HAVE WITH OF COURSE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE HERE FOR THE NEXT TO EIGHTEEN YEARS WITH EFFORT IS THE TO BE ABLE. TO TO TO MODIFY LATER BUT I I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- TWO SB TEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET LAST YEAR I VOTED FOR THAT AS WELL NOW WAS PERMISSIVE AS WELL SIDE. THAT'S COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR WITH YOUR BILL. ELEVEN AWAY DID REDISTRICTING THE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW THEY CAME TO MY TURN ON YOUR MIKE CENTER. I'M SO SORRY AN INSIDER UPDATE THE THE APPROVED IT FOR THE NEXT ROUND. YEAH BUT THEY HAVEN'T TRIED IT YET YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT THEY THEY'VE TAKEN INTO THE MECHANISM FOR THEY HAVE ANY IMPLEMENTED ABSOLUTELY SO -- SO WHERE I'M HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY IS THIS IS NOW REQUIRED THIS IS NOW AN IMPOSITION YOU HAVE TO DO IT THIS WAY. IT'S NOT PERMISSIVE. SO IT'S IT'S AGAIN PART OF THIS TEAM THAT KIND OF COPS UP THIS CROPS OF THIS YEAR. ALLEN THIS IS LOCAL CONTROL WERE TELLING SO MANY. MUNICIPALITIES THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA FORCE LAND PLANNING OR YOU KNOW HOUSING ARE ALL KIND OF HEALTH NEEDS OF IDEAS ON THE LOCALS ARE. SO I JUST BRING THAT UP. ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS IS A PHILOSOPHY OF NO BETTER NO WORSE AND THEY WERE SAYING THIS IS APPLICABLE TO ONLY COUNTIES WITH. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE SO IT DOESN'T GO TO ALL COUNTY SAMPLE NERVOUS ABOUT A TWO TIERED. SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- I WILL SUGGEST SURE THIS THAT THEIR POINT THAT WAS MADE TO THE SUPERVISORS ARE NONPARTISAN. AND I REALLY APPRECIATED BEING A NON PARTISAN OFFICE I'M NOW IN PARTISAN OFFICE AND IT IS. I'D SAY IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BEING OF A REPUBLICAN SENATOR YOU KNOW THAT WITH THAT LETTER BY MY NAME. I NEVER HAD THAT WHEN I WAS A SUPERVISOR OR OR COUNTY WHITE OFFICIALS SO YOUR LETTERS SCARLET. YEAH. I'M JUST SAYING IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT ANIMAL SO WE ARE DOING THIS. TO NONPARTISAN INDIVIDUALS THAT'S THAT'S IT'S A NEW TWIST. AND THEN I WILL ALSO SAVE OR ON BEHALF OF ELECTION OFFICIALS THERE APPOINTED BY THE BOARD. IN. A LEASE OURS IS OUR REGION NOT ALL OKAY WELL. I'M I WILL SAY FOR MY COUNTY THE RIGHT FOR VOTERS IS APPOINTED. AND IF THERE'S JUST A SIMPLE RULE OF DEPARTMENT HEADS AND THAT IS COUNT. TO THREE AND THERE IS A A POLITICAL COMPONENT TO THE WHOLE THING THAT I WOULD. I WOULD WARN YOU ABOUT. AS WELL SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF MY MY THOUGHTS WERE I'M INDA LIKE NERVOUS ABOUT ABOUT YOUR BILLS I'M. SURE THOSE. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS SENATOR I MEAN I I YOU KNOW LOOK IT'S IT'S ALWAYS IN PERFECT RIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE WAY [inaudible] OF OUR SYSTEM. I'M AYE AYE I SUPPOSE I SUPPOSE THE IDEA IS A RIGHT WE WE WE WE DON'T WANT. WE IN THE SPIRIT OF LOVE CONTROL pRIGHT YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST. HAVE SACRAMENTO I DRAW THE LINES THEMSELVES YOU DON'T GIVE IT TO THE STATEWIDE COMMISSION SO WE DID WANT TO COUNTIES TO BE INVOLVED REALLY WHAT. FOLKS WHO KNOW THE COUNTY OR FROM THE COUNTY OR OF THE COUNTY TO HELP CREATE THESE COMMISSIONS. AND YOU'RE RIGHT THEY ARE POINTED OR YOU KNOW THEY ARE POLITICAL FIGURES OF SORTS BUT WE DID FEEL AS THOUGH THEY WERE THE MOST INDEPENDENT. AND MOST APPROPRIATE PLACE. TO TO TO TO DO THIS -- BUT IT'S IN PERFECT NOW COURSE I STILL THINK THAT'S BETTER I MEAN THEY'RE STILL KIND OF SEVERAL DEGREES OF SEPARATION INOCULATION. FROM. THE FROM THE ELECTED FOR SUPERVISOR STATE OF COURSE AS SUCH A SELF INTEREST ASSOCIATE WITHDRAWN THEIR ALLIANCE. AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF PARTISANSHIP IN THIS NOW BUT ONCE AGAIN I JUST REPEAT. ON THE THE NO ONE PARTY CAN HAVE A MAJORITY SO EVEN IF. AS I SAY ALAMEDA COUNTY STRONG DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY OF OF A RESERVOIRS AND YET DEMOCRATS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. TO HAVE OVER 50% OF THAT I WOULD DISTRICT COMMISSION. SO WE HAVE TO BE FILLED IN BY THE WAY WITH. THE REALLY IMPORTANT GROWING PORTION OF POPULATION WHICH IS INDEPENDENCE. AND SO THEY'LL HAVE A IMPORTANCIA TABLE AND DRIVE THESE LINE. SO I I DO LOVE THE PARTISANSHIP BUT I BUT AS I SAY IT WAS IT WAS FORCED UPON US THE IN EARLIER COMMITTEE BUT I THINK WE FOUND AN ELEGANT WAY OF OF OF REALLY MAKING SURE THAT. THEY DO THEIR THEIR WINDY UNDUE INFLUENCE OF BY ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL PARTY. I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING REDISTRICTING AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND I MET WITH HER SPONSORS AND AND I'LL TELL YOU IT'S A FIFTY FIFTY DEAL I TRY TO BE AS PURE. PERSONALLY IT'S LIKE COULD BE -- BUT I AM PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW THE DAY I WAS NOT HAPPY. WITH THE PROCESS I ST STE I STOOD UP AND SAID HERE'S WHY AM VOTING THE WAY I AM YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE SOME OF THAT. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE THAT WERE DONE SO I I I I GET WHAT YOU'RE. JUST WHEN IT. THE SHARED FROM FROM THAT RESPECT YEAH YEAH BUT WE'RE ON THIS ON THE TWO TIER THING YOU BROUGHT UP QUICKLY MR ONLY A MOTHER BILLS ONLY REASON WE DID YOU CAN ONE OF THE HOSE. A VERY SMALL COUNTY YEAH THIS IS IS COUNTY WITH LIKE OUTDOOR FOURTEENER PEOPLE AT AGE OUTLINE.

VERY HAPPY TO ADOPT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. TO ASSIST THE LOGISTICAL WORK THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED UNDER THIS BILL BY THE DEPARTMENT TAX. AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. SO I THIS BILL. ASKS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOT YOU TORIE PERMISSION TO PLACE A BALLOT MEASURE. OF BEFORE THE VOTERS. RESIDING WITHIN THE TEN THOUSAND SEVEN FORTY THREE SQUARE MILES AND COMPRISE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WHICH WAS AYE NEAR BASIN THAT COLLECTIVELY ENCOMPASSES. THE THE LA THE GREATER LA BASIN. THESE BOUNDARIES ARE HOME TO ROUGHLY TWENTY MILLION RESIDENTS. ARE THE WITH THE VERY FIRST AIR POLLUTION CONTROLS IN THE US -- THEY WERE IMPOSE WITHIN THIS YEAR BOTH BASIN BY THE PREDECESSOR AGENCY TO THE CURRENT A C&lt;c.cyan&gt; DE.&lt;/c&gt; OVER DECADES SUBSTANTIAL. PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE BUT BUT NONE THE LESS -- YEAH. WE WE'VE WE CONTINUE TO SEE CHALLENGES AND YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S NOW RAISING A CHILD IN THE SOUTH COAST IN IN IN THE LA AREA AYE AYE AYE SIR WE REMAIN VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT AIR QUALITY LEVELS WE'VE IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY LEVEL SIGNIFICANTLY LARGELY AS A RESULT OF ALL THE WORK THAT EIGHTEEN D. OTHERS HAVE DONE. ARE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I THINK THE AVERAGE ANGELINA WAS WARY ABOUT HALF OF THE LUNG CAPACITY. I I HAVE A KID GROWING UP IN RURAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL THE AIR QUALITY THANK GOD WE'VE MOVED BEYOND THAT BUT NONETHELESS ARE STILL CONTINUES TO BE. ENORMOUS HEALTH IMPACTS. ON ON OUR RESIDENTS ASTHMA BRONCHITIS DECREASED. ALONG GROWTH IN IN CHILDREN CANCER CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PREMATURE DEATH EMERGENCY ROOM HOSPITAL VISITS. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HEALTH REALLY LOST WORKDAYS AND STUDENT ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL WHAT A LOT OF ECONOMIC COST TO DO ALL THIS AS WELL. I INTO THE I CAN DE RECENTLY ADOPTED A SCIENTIFICALLY RIGOROUS AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN. WHICH PROPOSES TO FURTHER ITS MISSION TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN LEGALLY MANDATED CLEANER OBJECTIVE THROUGH ESPECIALLY REPLACING BOTH STATIONARY AND MOBILE SOURCES. I CONTINUE TO POLLUTE THE AIR BASIN WITH ZERO EMISSION NEAR EMISSIONS. OR THE CLEANEST COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES HOWEVER. THE SUCCESS OF THIS. THIS AMBITIOUS PLAN IS INCURRED UPON SECURING A ROBUST MULTI YEAR REVENUE STREAM TO FIND A WIDE SPECTRUM OF LONG TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS -- THIS BILL PROVIDES STATURE FRAMEWORK TO ENABLE VOTERS IN THE SOUTH COAST FOR COUNTY DISTRICT TO CONSIDER. A POTENTIAL SALES TAX INCREASE SUFFICIENT IN SIZE AND SCOPE TO CLEAN UP THE AIR IF. THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WANTS. TO PUT OUT FOR IT. SO I'M SO GRATEFUL AND BY THE WAY KI&lt;c.cyan&gt; DE BORD IS A MIX OF&lt;/c&gt; FOLKS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH IN TERMS THE PARTISAN MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. SO I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE BOARD. I ABOVE OF BOARD MEMBERS COALITION REGIONAL LEADERS OF OUR MAILCHIMP MEANS WHO SUGGESTED THAT IF THE BILL MOVES TOWARD WEEK WE CONSIDER EXPLICITLY INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING BOTH PROVISIONS TO EXPRESSLY ENABLE FUNDING. FOR ENHANCED REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS MAY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS. TO REDUCE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS END AUTHORIZATION FOR REGIONAL EXPENDITURES TO ELECTRIFY MODERNIZE AND FULLY BUILT OUT THE METROLINK. COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEM INTO EIGHT COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION'S IN THEIR PLANS TO IMPLEMENT. A CLEANER TRANSIT SYSTEM. FINALLY MY STAFF AND I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS INDUCTORS QUESTIONS WITH OPPONENTS AND SUPPORTERS MANY GROUPS. INCLUDING ORGANIZED LABOR WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE POLICY CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE REVENUES OF POTENTIAL BALLOT MEASURE WOULD BE SPENT. TO TRANSITION TO A CLEANER REGIONAL ECONOMY THAT ALSO SUPPORTS A STABLE MIDDLE CLASS. I RECOGNIZE THE CONCERN THE TAX DOLLARS YOUR MIND. A LOT OF HARD WORK FOR THAT LABOR HAS TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN WITH EMPLOYERS ON BEHALF OF THEIR MEMBERS AND SO. THESE ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE WORKED OUT BUT WITH ME TODAY I HAVE WE NOT ST IS EXACTLY DIRECTOR OF SOUTH COAST HM DIAZ OF ANYTHING. WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MOVE LA? THANK YOU SO MUCH EXACTLY RIGHT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU TRAVEL HERE THANK YOU FOR TOLERATING THE LENGTH OF THIS HEARING. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TRULY AT YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES SIR. FOR SOURCE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS WAYNE ASTRI ON THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. IN SPITE OF ALL THE AIR QUALITY PROGRESS THAT SAID MADE. IN THE SOUTH COAST BASIN WE STILL HAVE THE WORST OZONE AIR QUALITY IN THE NATION. ADVERSELY IMPACTING THE HEALTH OF OVER SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. I TWENTY SIXTEEN AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN CALLS FOR OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AN INCENTIVE FUNDING TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN VEHICLES. EQUIPMENT AND ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE. SB SEVEN THIRTY TWO ALLOWS THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH COAST REGION TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. WHAT THEY WANT TO INVEST IN CLEAN AIR AND ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE? FUNDING FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR AQ MP WOULD RESULT IN UNPRECEDENTED BENEFITS. FIRST WE WOULD ATTAIN FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND ELIMINATE UNHEALTHY AIR POLLUTION IN THE SOUTH COAST REGION. SECOND WE WOULD MEET OUR REGION CHAIR. OF THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOAL OF 80% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY MISSION LEVELS BY. TWENTY FIFTY AND THIRD. WE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED TOXIC RISK DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BY ELIMINATING DIESEL EMISSIONS. ACHIEVING CLEAN AIR MEANS REDUCING SERIOUS HEALTH IMPACTS. AS MUG BRONCHITIS PREMATURE DEATH. HUNDREDSOF THOUSANDS OF MISS SCHOOL AND WORK DAYS. ALL OF THIS REPRESENTING OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN TERMS OF HEALTH BENEFITS OVERALL. BUT IMPORTANTLY UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT THE SOUTH COAST MUST ATTAIN. THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN OZONE STANDARD BY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE DISTRICT MUST SUBMIT MEASURES TO EPA BY. TWENTY TWENTY THEY'RE SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY TIMES OF KNOX. PER YEAR. THE MOBILE SOURCE REGULATIONS CANNOT BE ADOPTED OR IMPLEMENTED FAST ENOUGH TO MEET THE FEDERAL DEADLINES. AND THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE THESE EMISSION REDUCTIONS. IS TO INCENTIVIZE A MASSIVE TURNOVER. TWO ZERO AND YEARS ZERO EMISSION ENGINES FOR MOBILE SOURCES THROUGH EXACTLY DRUDGERY OF A OUT THIRTY SECONDS JUST ADD APOLOGIZE BUT IT'S ONE MAKE IT MAKE SURE YOU'RE ABLE TO FINISH THAT UP. THANK YOU. SO THE DISTRICT CANNOT SUBMIT THESE MEASURES BY TWENTY TWENTY USEPA MUST IMPOSE SANCTIONS. INCLUDING CREATING EXPENSE OF HURDLES FOR NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITY. CUTTING OFF FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDING THAT'S REPRESENTING ALMOST A HUNDRED ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AT RISK IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS. THE TASTE PLAN. FURTHER THE EPA COULD INSTITUTE A FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF STATE AND LOCAL AIR POLLUTION EFFORTS IN THE SOUTH COAST. WE URGE YOU TO PASS SB SEVEN THIRTY TWO TO ENSURE A PATHWAY FOR SUFFICIENT FUNDING. TO ATTAIN FEDERAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. TECH PUBLIC HEALTH AND AVOID FEDERAL SANCTIONS THAT WOULD HURT THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND JEOPARDIZE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. THANK YOU NOT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AGAIN WE TRULY APPRECIATE YOU HANGING WITH US TODAY IT'S BEEN A LONG ONE CAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SIR.

PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAD TO THAT AS WELL -- BUT I PREFER TO SPEAK TODAY AS THE FATHER OF A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD WHO'S QUITE WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE THREE REASONS REALLY WHY THIS -- SHOULD BE APPROVED BY THE COMMITTEE THE FIRST. AS MR NASH TREE HAS STATED IS REALLY DIESEL AIR POLLUTION IN THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WHICH IS A NON TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT THE DOMINANT SOURCE. OF AIR POLLUTION IN THE DISTRICT WHICH RESIST REGULATION BECAUSE ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN REGULATE IT WE NEED IN THE CENTER PROGRAM ON SCALE THEY'VE ESTIMATED BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THAT PROGRAM. THE SECOND PURPOSE REALLY IS TO JOIN YOU IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE KNOW NOW THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO ROLL BACK GLOBAL WARMING. HOWEVER IT WILL TAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THERE'S ONLY TWO PLACES WITHOUT INVESTMENT CAN REALLY COME FROM ON SCALE THAT'S EITHER FROM YOU FOLKS THE SENATE CALIFORNIA OR FROM THE VOTERS. PROBABLY IN THE SOUTH COAST AIR DISTRICT WHERE CAN WHERE IT CAN REALLY VOTE ON SIGNIFICANT SCALE. THE THIRD REASON THOUGH I THINK IS THE OPPORTUNITY OF REGIONAL MEASURE CAN PRESENT. FOR CREATING A TRULY CLEAN AIR RAIL SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE REGION THE METAL EXISTENCE IS A NORMAS OPPORTUNITY IS NOT YET IN THE BILL WE BELIEVE IT BECOMES AN OPPORTUNITY GOING FORWARD WE URGENT. I THINK THE DISTRICT IS BECOMING RECEPTIVE TO THAT BUT THOSE THREE REASONS REALLY CLEAN AIR. CLIMATE CHANGE AND A VAST REGIONAL -- TRANSIT SYSTEM. ONLY SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS CAN ACHIEVE THAT LET'S SEE THEY'RE GONNA BE SACRAMENTO -- IS GOING TO BE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH MRS ANGRY FOR OF YOUR COMMENTS AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HANGING WITH US TODAY WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP TO ANYONE ELSE WHO IS IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD STATE YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME AS WELL AS YOUR ORGANIZATION.

WE'RE GONNA ASK WHATEVER WITNESSES TO BE TO MAKE ROOM IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION AND WILL WELCOME YOU BACK UP. AS SOON AS THE OPPOSITION HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE -- FREE YET. AN EQUITABLE WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE OUR SECONDARY WITNESSES IN ONE IS OUR PRIMARY. SO -- ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FAIR AND EQUITABLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE TO BE A PRIMARY WITNESS YOU CAN ON TALKING TO YOURSELVES MY NOMINATION [inaudible] OKAY. IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. BY NOMINATION -- THE MAN THE MYTH ALLEGE MR WILL BACK FIVE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT SIR YOU. HAVE THE FLOOR AND WE'LL GO TO OUR SECONDARY WITNESSES WELCOME BACK HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU -- MEMBERS -- GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY BUT AND UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS TO HAVE THAT GOING FOR ME AND JUST AND STRAIGHT. SO -- WE ARE DEFINITELY OPPOSED SB SEVEN THIRTY TWO TODAY AND I WANT TO MENTION TWO THINGS THAT I MISTER NOW ACTUALLY MENTIONED IN HIS VERY ABLE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- TWO POINTS THAT HE RAISED THE FIRST ONE BEING PRECEDENCE OKAY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME AN AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. HAS AUTHORIZED A TAX OF THIS NATURE THIS IS A SENATOR ALLEN MENTION ATTACKS THAT ENCOMPASSES TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS FOUR OF THE BIGGEST COUNTIES IN THE STATE THIS IS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE -- SO THERE'S PRECEDENT SETTING NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WERE TARGETING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THERE ARE DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES MEMBERS WITH SALES TAXES. PARTICULARLY NOW I COUNTY OF ACT OR OVER 10%. AND YOU KNOW THIS WOULD ADD AT LEAST 1% TO THAT AMOUNT -- AND THAT RAISES CONCERNS BECAUSE SALES TAXES ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY REGRESSIVE. AND ARE GONNA MAKE THE COST OF GOODS MORE EXPENSIVE -- ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. AND FINALLY MEMBERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AND EVEN BOUNDARIES. KIND OF FOR THE REASON THAT I MENTIONED AT THE TOP THIS IS A ESSENTIALLY FOR COUNTY TAX SPENDING TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE -- TAXES OF SALES TAXES OF THIS OF THIS KIND TEND TO BE CONSTRUCTED AMONG CITIES AND COUNTIES PRIMARILY AND NOT ACROSS MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND I THINK THAT CREATES -- THE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND MAKES TAX COMPLIANCE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS ASPIRIN ABOUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER WOLF WE WELCOME OUR SECOND WITNESS IN OPPOSITION YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF PETER BLOCKER WITH CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN OPPOSITION. ECHO MANY THE COMMENTS THAT I MISS ROTH MADE I'D ALSO ADD THAT -- IN ADDITION TO AUTHORIZE IN THE DISTRICT TO IMPOSE A SALES AND USE TAX OR TREES TRANSACTION CAN USE TAX -- IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THEM TO GO ABOVE -- 1% ABOVE THE AND THIS 2% CAPS IMPORTANT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS A ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE THAT CAP IS NOT ONLY TO EASE COMPLIANCE BUT THE PROTECT ACT FAIRS REGRESSIVE TAX BECAUSE CALIFORNIA AT SOME POINT 25%. STATE IMPOSE RATE IS THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY -- AND ALSO JUST ADD THAT -- WE URGE CAUTION IN -- INSTEAD IN THIS PRESIDENT OF ALLOWING THE DISTRICT LIKE THIS TO HAVE THIS ABILITY -- TO INFLOWS ATTACKS LIKE THIS -- AS THE ANALYSIS POINTED OUT. WELL WE'RE THIS IF THIS WERE ADOPTED -- THERE WERE COULD THERE WAS THE IS THE POTENTIAL -- FOR PARTS OF UNDER DISTRICT TO HAVE A SALES AND USE TAXES HIGH IS A LOT OF ELEVEN POINT 25%. WHICH IS VERY HIGH AND THIS WOULD KIND OF CREATED A ANOTHER BLANKET OF TRANSACTIONS NEW TAXES ON TAXPAYERS IN THOSE. IN THOSE AREAS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR AND OUR FINAL PLEASE SIR WELCOME YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES THANKS FOR BEING HERE THANKS FOR HANGING WITH US THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE TO SAY IS ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHERE I GOT SPEND THE ENTIRE. DAY ONE COMMITTEE AND IT IS VERY REFRESHING TO WATCH THE MULTITUDINOUS OF THE ISSUES BEFORE YOU SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY NOT THANK YOU SO MUCHYOU'RE VERY MY NAME. I'M SORRY MY NAME IS MARK WHAT'S AND I'M REPRESENTING RIVERSIDE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TODAY. AND I JUST EXPRESSED OF TO THE AUTHOR OF THE THE THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT HERE IN OPPOSITION. SO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS SEPARATE RIVERSIDE-COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS ASKED ME TO CONVEY A SERIES OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROCESS THE REST OF THIS BILL TO THIS POINT TIME. AS WELL AS TO CONCLUDE WITH A COUPLE OF POINTERS. TO FOR THE AUTHORS EXPOSITOR ISN'T OTHERS TO CONSIDER GOING FORWARD. SO FIRST OF ALL -- THERE ARE CTC RECYCLING TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IS WELL KNOWN I THINK IN THIS CAPITAL T'S DONE MIRACULOUS THINGS OVER THE YEARS. THERE WELL REGARDED THE VERY CAPABLE AS A LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. THERE ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOBILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. AND THEY'RE VERY ADEPT AT WORKING WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS YET THEY'VE ASKED ME TO STEP FORWARD HERE TODAY. TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BILL. WAS AT A FAR REACH FROM THE FOLKS WITHIN OUR CTC THAT INCLUDES SEVERAL SUPERVISORS AND TWENTY NINE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. SO THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND FOLKS WHO HAVE AN AFFILIATION WITH OUR CTC. ARE WE BINS SINCE THE BILL WAS -- VIA HEARD ABOUT AND LAUNCHED IN THE FALL WE'VE BEEN REPEATEDLY ASKING FOR INFORMATION. ARE SUCH THINGS AS WHAT PROGRAMS WILL BE FUNDED SUCH THINGS AS WELL HOW WOULD BE ENSURE THAT. THE INLAND EMPIRE RESIDENTS WILL SEE A FAIR SHARE RETURNED DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE DEALT WITH IN THE BILL. AND ONCE THE LANGUAGE IS FINALLY AVAILABLE WITH UNDERSTAND FOUND THAT THERE'S A 6% EXPENSE ALLOWANCE WHICH IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE SELF HELP COUNTY. LEGISLATION I WILL POINT OUT AND NUMBER SHOULD SHOW MY AGE HI HELP RIGHT THE FIRST TO SELF HELP COUNTY. BILLS IN MID EIGHTIES EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY SIX AND IN BOTH CASES THEY HAVE 1%. CAPS ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SO I JUST PUT PASSED ON AS A SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS OKAY A THE LAST TWO KEY CONCERNS ARE FIRST THAT ON BEHALF OF OUR CTC ANYONE EMPIRE AT LARGE. THERE IS A GREAT POTENTIAL THAT -- WE COULD BE LEFT OUT BECAUSE OF THE MAKE UP OF THE BOARD IN TERMS OF MAKING PROJECT DECISIONS AND PROGRAM DECISIONS SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE THINK NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT OUT AND TAKEN. TO AND HAVE SOMEONE TAKE A LOOK AT AND FINALLY WE HEARD RUMORS ABOUT THE METROLINK. A LANGUAGE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY. PERSPECTIVE ONE WAY THE OTHER FACT I REPRESENT METROLINX IT'S KIND OF AN ODD POSITION VIçT. BUT THE POINT HERE IS. THAT SEE HEARING ABOUT AMENDMENTS THAT AFFECT. METROLINK AND YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE OUR CTC IS ONE OF THE FIVE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE GPA BOARD AND HAS NOT BEEN TALKED TO AT ALL IN ADVANCE OF THE LANGUAGE BEING PUT ON THE TABLE. IS HIGHLY IRREGULAR SO WITHOUT I CONCLUDE. AND BEG YOUR INDULGENCE FOR MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AS THE DISTANCE MAJORITY LEADER CAME OVER WAS JUST SAYING -- THINKING YOU FOR YOUR YEARS SERVICE HERE IN THE BUILDING AND BEYOND TO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

DALY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY I WOULD ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF MR WHAT'S MY FORMER BOSS. I'M AND OUR FRIENDS AT OUR CTC AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE QUALMS ABOUT -- ABOUT THE LAUDABLE GOALS OF THE BILL AND WE THANK SENATOR ALLEN HIS ABLE STAFF FOR WORKING HARD ON THIS ISSUE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE FUNDING SOURCE. AND WE THINK THAT THE ACTIONS NEED TO BE -- COMBINED TRANSPORTATION AIR GO HAND IN HAND. COMING TOGETHER AROUND HOW TO MAKE THESE ISSUES WORK TOGETHER IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO. A SOME YOU KNOW THERE IF WE PUSH TOWARDS. AND OVER DOING IT BOARD OF OLD CLOTHES THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GRATEFUL. WE LIKE TO BE A YOU LAST CALL FOR THOSE WERE IN OPPOSITION WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR FIRST AND LAST ORGANIZATION. TIME WELCOME BACK SIR REX ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA'S PROBABLY CESSATION ALSO POST THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS FOR BEING HERE. ASK OFFER THOSE WERE OPPOSED. HEARING TINO WOULD LIKE TO BE TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO BE AN ISSUE. WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG. ELSA CEREBELLUM THERE ALSO A STARK. I HAD A MEETING I DON'T KNOW MISTER SAYING WHEN WAS THAT MY OFFICE WITH THE IT'S JUST SAYING ONE OF THE PROPONENTS AND ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS IN LIFE AND ONE OF THE GREATEST POLITICAL MINDS I KNOW VICTOR GRAY GO -- SOMETIME AGO WHICH PROBABLY SPENT AN HOUR AND A HALF OR TWO HOURS AND AT THAT TIME. I SAID THIS WAS THE DUMBEST THING IN THE WORLD. I OVER JUDGE A LITTLE BIT BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY DO THAT'S A LONG-DAY. I I WAS REALLY UNHAPPY HE WAS MY THINKING AND I SURE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT PUT IN THE RECORD FOR THIS PURPOSE. YOU KNOW WE'VE WATCHED OVER THE YEARS HOW THESE EBBS AND FLOWS WORK IT'S EASY FOR US TO GOVERNMENT WHERE EVERYBODY ALWAYS THE LIST OF PEOPLE THAT WANT MONEY IN NEW REVENUE STREAM IS EASY. RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS THE TAXPAYER GROUPS THAT ALL WE CAN PUSH THOSE OFF OF MY PARTY. BUT WE GOT A STEP BACK FROM IT LOOK AT THE LARGER FRAMEWORK WHICH I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO NOW FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS NOT SUCCESSFULLY. BUT IN EARNEST. THE LOS ANGELES WE JUST SPENT ON IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST RAISED A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS LOWER LA WE PASSED MEASURE ARE AND WHATEVER IT WAS FRONT AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN TRANSPORTATION. WE ADDED ON THE TAX FOR MR BELL'S MEASURE FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION A YEAR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS HE KNOWS BETTER THAN I FOR TRANSPORTATION SUBSEQUENT TO THAT. WE JUST DID STORMWATER EVERYBODY SAYS THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH GONNA STOP UNLESS USED WITH THESE NPDES PERMITS AND ALL THESE COASTAL CITIES IN THEIR FINES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STORM WATER. WE NOW HAVE A MEASURE FOR A PARTIAL TAX ANOTHER PARTIAL TAX AFTER STORM WATER FOR EDUCATION BECAUSE THE H. SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO FALL APART. WE HAD HOUSING MEASURE H. IN LOS ANGELES HHH THE COUNTY ONE OF THE CITY FOR MONEY FOR HOUSING I HAVEN'T SEEN A STICK BEING BUILT YEAH. THE POINT IS THAT AND THERE'S MORE AND MORE AND MORE IN THIS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT SPLIT ROLE COMING UP IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THAT'S OFFICE ALREADY ON THE BALLOT. AND SO HERE YOU'VE GOT AN AGENT'S AN ENTITY THAT SAYS OKAY. WE WE WE JUST HAD THE SILO THESE THINGS -- QUOTE YOU KNOW AIR QUALITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TRANSPORTATION WHICH AFFECTED AIR QUALITY FOR THE STANDARDS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE ISSUE IS IN A RAISE THIS IS THE THIS WHOLE BALLOT BOX BUDGETING WE JUST SAW THIS THIS BOND ISSUE ON THE BALLOT WERE PEOPLE KIND OF ROLLED THE TRUCK UP TO THE BACK OF THE TREASURY FOR CONTINUES APPROPRIATION? OF FOUR FOUR WATER PROJECTS AND EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE WE NEED TO SIT BACK AND HAVE A LARGER WE WERE TALKING WITH CENTER MORLOCK ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME. AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION IN THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY ON HIS PROPERTY TALK ABOUT TAXES IN THIS YEAR BUT THE POINT IS THAT. LOOK I HAVE NO OBJECTION SENATOR TO THE AND I'M GONNA SPORTS BILL WATCH IT OUT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO ALL THIS STUFF BECAUSE I BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE A DECENT FELLOW AND I THINK YOU'RE AN HONEST GUY AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA WORK HARD TO FIGURE THIS OUT. BUT I THINK SUPPORT FOR THE RECORD YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE CONCERT IT'S EASY I THINK YOU'RE GONNA WORKING HARD AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE STUFF FOR GRANTED I GET IT. I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FRAME IT OUT. THAT. MAN WE JUST GOTTA CUT THIS OUT. EVERYBODY HAS AN INTEREST GROUP AND ALL THEIR LITTLE OCC SILOS OF INTEREST GROUPS TO GET TOGETHER TO SUPPORT A REVENUE STREAM WE GONNA LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. THE VOLATILITY PIECE OF CALIFORNIA THE UPS AND DOWNS IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE WE'VE GOT GREAT CHALLENGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE DOING BRILLIANTLY WE JUST SAW THE REVENUE NUMBERS ARE GREAT. AND I'VE SEEN THESE PATTERNS WHERE THINGS ARE FANTASTIC EVERY WOULD BE GOING INTO THE BLOWS UP AND THEN ITS SHUTDOWN FOR TEN YEARS. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED MONEY FOR AIR QUALITY IS NO QUESTION THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE DONE. EN EN ALL OF YOU YOU KNOW I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS SIX TO GET IT OUT SO YOU CAN WORK ON IT AND CONTINUE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE IN GIVEN THE SITUATION. BUT I REALLY THINK THAT HERE'S ANOTHER GROUP COMING IN SAYING HERE'S THE DEAL YOU KNOW AND I I BY THE WAY WAS IT WAS A CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS. THE ALL THE BOND ISSUES THAT FOR BOND ISSUESI DID FOR BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SCHOOLS TAKING MONEY. OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND THAT ABOUT A PROP. NINETY EIGHT PAPER SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS SO. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT THE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT BUT I JUST THINK AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO SIT DOWN AND I KNOW YOUR THOUGHTFUL PERSON. AND YOU WILL TAKE THIS FOR WHAT IT MEANS THAT WE GONNA SIT BACK AND FIGURE THIS THING OUT YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT. CITIES AT LA'S LIKE JAHLEEL USERS IT'S GONNA PUT DOWN ANOTHER BOND ANOTHER PARTIAL TAX FOR EDUCATION THEN THE PEOPLE OVER HERE ON ON SPLIT RIGHT TO SAY WE MONEY FOR EDUCATION PEOPLE SO WE JUST BY THE MONEY. HERE THEY'RE GONNA PUT THIS ON THE BALLOT HOW'S HAT GOING TO AFFECT A LARGER DYNAMIC WHAT THIS BILL DOES IF IT PASSES AND GET SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IS GIVE YOU AUTHORITY WITH MY REQUEST IS AS A AS A CITIZEN IN THE PATRIOT. IS IS TO STOP FOR A MINUTE AND FIGURE OUT THE LARGER ARCHITECTURE. OF HOW WE REINVENT THIS STUFF AND AND THIS BALLOT BOX BUDGETING IS JUST GOING TO KILL US. IT'S JUST GOING TO KILL US EAT IT IT'S ALWAYS EASY FOR THE BEST CAUSES. BUT WE WE JUST NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT SO I HAVE BEEN SUPPORT HAPPY TO MOVE IF YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT -- IN TERMS OF THAT DISCUSSION BUT I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING OVER THE CLIFF AND WE JUST GONNA BE MORE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT A LARGER COMPREHENSIVE VIEW. AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE OF ORGAN FOR NINE YEARS AND HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND I'VE BEEN A CONTRIBUTOR DEUTSCHES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS. SO BUT BUT I JUST. WANT TO SHARE THAT VIEW WITH THE COMMITTEE AT AND WITH THE AUTHOR. HAVE CENTER ALLEN BEER TO RESPOND I JUST WANNA REMIND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE HAVE THREE BILLS IN FRONT OF US IN ONE IS GOING TO BE RATHER IN DEPTH. SO -- SO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE -- FOLKS IN OUR COMMENTS IN THE CENTER ALLEN PLEASE IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO CENTER HERTZBERG AS WELL AS IN IN THE OPPOSITION WILL GO TO SENATOR BALLOT IN THE VICE HAIR. YEAH I I WILL I WILL JUST SEE YOU WITH RESPECT AT CENTERS FOR HIM IT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAY NOT AS A STICK IS GONE AND I I THINK YOU KNOW SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS ALREADY BROKE GROUND HHH THE TARGET IS. TEN I'M YOU MEASUREMENTS MEASURE ARE WE GOT THE EXPO LINE WE'VE GOT THE FOOTHILLS GO ONLINE -- YOU GOT THE CRENSHAW CRYSTALLIZE NEARLY DIED YOU GUIDE THE REGIONAL CONNECTOR NEARLY DONE DOWNTOWN THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITHOUT MONEY AND YOU KNOW IT WE CAN ALWAYS STRETCH IT FURTHER AND OR MEASURE OUR MEASURE YEAH. AND THE ONE THING I WILL SAY I I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU BUT BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S UP TO THE PEOPLE RIGHT AND AND IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE THREE OF YOUR HOUSE IS A TALK ABOUT HOW NOT ONLY WILL THE BOARD HAVE TO PROVE. PLACING THAT MEASURE ON THE BALLOT THESE ARE ALL PUBLICLY ELECTED PEOPLE WHO ACCOUNTABLE THE VOTERS BUT THEN THE VOTERS HAVE TO VOTE FOR IT BY TWO THIRDS VOTE -- SO. IT OUT OUR AYE AYE I GUESS THE QUESTION YEAH AND IT ON LIKE LIKE A BEHIND THIS IS NOT -- IS NOT DEAD FINANCE THIS IS ACTUALLY FINANCED BY THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE MAKE THE DECISION WITH THE DO IT OR NOT THE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY. PETITION PUT SOME ON THE BALLOT TO RESCIND IT IF IF THEY WANT TO AND EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW HARD IT IS TO PASS TAXES. JUSTIFIABLY RIGHT AND NOBODY WANTS TO PAY MORE -- SOLD HIM LIKE THIS IS ABOUT KEEPING FAITH WITH THE PUBLIC AND IF THE PUBLIC. YOU KNOW THAT'S A LOOK THIS IN THE EYE AND MAKE A DECISION WHETHER TO SUPPORT OR NOT AND HOW TO DO IT A TWO THIRDS LEVEL. THAT'S A HIGH BAR TO MEET AND AND YOU KNOW IF OUR FOLKS WANT TO VOTE FOR IT AND THEN THEN THEY KNOW IF THEY THINK THAT THIS IS WHERE THE IF THEY THINK THE BOARD IS COME TO THEM AND REALLY MADE THE CASE. THEN I THINK. YOU KNOW THE WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD -- YEAH IT'S HIGH BAR TO MEET. AS A POSSIBLE TOOK TIME. OUT BUT IF PEOPLE WANT TO VOTE FOR IT AND THEN THEY REJECTED AND WE DON'T HAVE IT. WELL EXCELLENT SAID COURSE THAT'S THE CASE IT SHOULD EVERY CASE BUT IT'S WE WE DON'T LIVE IN A VACUUM. IF YOU'RE ASKING VOTER CHOOSE BETWEEN HOUSING -- A CLEAN AIR THIS THAT THIS THAT THIS ND UNDERSTANDING IN OTHER CONSEQUENCES WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IN THESE PROCESSES IN OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE LARGER FRAME. OF CREATING A THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THERE MIGHT BE A DOWN TURN IT ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL THESE FINDINGS ARE GONNA BE CUT LIKE WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN THE ECONOMY WENT DOWN BY 3% THE BUDGET THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS CUT BY 23%. THEY DON'T KNOW THAT AND SO THE QUESTION IS IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US A LITTLE BIT IN THIS LARGER DISCUSSION AGAIN. OBSERVATION BUT JUST TO BE ABLE TO INFORM IT IN THE GREATER DEBATE THAT'S RIGHT TO ALL I WILL SAY IT IF THAT HAPPENS ALL THE MORE REASON WHY YOU NEED LOCAL FUNDING STREAM WHEN WE HAVE THE BUDGET CUT MY SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK GOD WE HAVE LOCAL LOCALLY SOURCED MONEY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP OUR DISTRICT ALIVE BECAUSE THE STATE MONEY GOT CUT SO TREMENDOUSLY DURING THE LAST DOWNTURN MOVE THE BILL. WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR WE HAVE A COUPLE WEEKS A COUPLE FOLKS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS WE HAVE I CENTER BELL IN THE VICE CHAIR CENTER ABOUT WE MISSION -- FOR OKAY MIGHT MY ISSUE IS THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY STRICKEN HAVE THERE IT IS THERE ANY OTHER AIR DISTRICTS THAT SALES TAX. REVENUE SOURCES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MR EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THANK YOU I'M CENTER VALVE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BAY AREA HAS A PARCEL TAX. BUT THAT THERE ARE NO OTHERS. TAX. MEASURES MOST OF THE DISTRICTS ANSWER LEGISLATIVE CREDIT DON'T AVE THE AUTHORITY. TO EVEN PLACE THAT MEASURE ON THE BALLOT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING SO THAT'S THE PRESIDENT. ESSENTIALLY WOULD THIS BE FOLLOWED UP BY. SO MY QUESTION WOULD BE WOULD THIS BE FOLLOWED UP BY OTHER DISTRICTS GO MAN. ESPECIALLY MINE. I MADE AN HOUSING FOR SALE STARTS. A NO YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT THE WAY WE WOULD PUT IT THE YOU KNOW ANOTHER REGRESSIVE TAX. I HOPE SO SO CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT ISSUE YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE RAISED THIS ISSUE WITH THAT CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ASSOCIATION THAT TIME. WAS TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN -- LOOK AT PARCEL TAXES OPPOSE A SALES TAX WHAT AREA ONE I THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT -- WE ARE CONSIDERED BUT WHEN WE HAD ACTUALLY DONE A OF PUBLIC SURVEYS. WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS GENERAL SUPPORT FOR SALES TAX EASY PEASY. SALES TAX IS ALWAYS THE ONE THAT SHOWS EYES OPEN POLLS. ARE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE -- THE OTHER QUESTION IS -- IS THIS BUILDING -- IT IS THE IS THE ATTENTION OF THIS BILL TO BE AMENDED THAT WILL. INVOLVE -- FUNDING OF TRANSPORTATION -- FACILITIES WE ARE. WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND CLEARLY TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT GOODS MOVEMENT ALL HAVE IMPACTS ON AIR QUALITY WE CERTAINLY SEE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS AIR QUALITY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVE THE OVERALL ECONOMY OKAY -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT YOU KNOW I LIKE. THEY MUCH PREFER A WILL NOT TO SET A PERSON SALES TAX BUT OVER THE BILL THE DAY -- IF IT INVOLVED IN HIS AMENDED TO INVOLVE TRANSPORTATION I THINK IT'S FAIR TO TALK TO OUR COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW IT ALSO JUST POINT THAT OUT. IT BECOMES A TRANSPORTATION BILL AS OPPOSED TO JUST AN AIR QUALITY BILL. SO SO. THAT'S NO SIR BY CALLING ON THAT SO -- I THINK THAT -- WE'D LIKE. TO FOLLOW THE BILL CLOSELY. MISTER CHAIRMAN SO I JUST. THINK OF MY STATEMENT HERE RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE WE'RE AWARE. IS AMENDED TO BECOME MORE OF A TRANSPORTATION BILL THAT'S A CHANGE OF THE AND RUSSIAN SO. THANK YOU NO I APPRECIATE THAT -- INDIA AS THE CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION. I KNOW THAT -- SHE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME INPUT IN SOME GUIDANCE ON THAT IS WELL -- AND I DON'T PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH MISTER CHAIRMAN PROBABLY EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER WELL I REALLY I I THINK IT'S NOT JUST ME BUT MY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THAT ARE FROM. ESPECIALLY FROM THE SOUTH COAST AREA. WOULD LIKE TO PROBABLY HAVE SOME INPUT IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE IF THAT HAPPENS THANK YOU SO MUCH MR EXECUTIVE OFFICER DIRECTORS FUND THAT. AS I SAID WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES -- TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. ON THAT THERE IS ISSUES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NO THEY TO BE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIRS IN A ROCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I THINK. CENTER HERTZBERG KATIC COVERED MOST OF THINGS I WANTED TO SAY. JUST THINKING POLITICALLY TRYING TO GET A TWO THIRDS. VOTE ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE FOUR COUNTIES -- IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD -- ORANGE I DON'T THINK COULD BE VERY RECEPTIVE THEIR SELF HELP COUNTY AND IT WAS HARD ENOUGH TO GET OUR MEASURE IN. PAST -- I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE -- JUST A LOT OF OUR YOUNG KIDS ARE MOVING OUT THERE AND THEN COMING AND ORANGE COUNTY TO WORK -- BUT SO JUST JUST THE TO TO PUT THAT OUT THERE WHATEVER BOWLING YOU HAVE. A GOOD POINT -- I AM JUST CURIOUS SINCE THE GOVERNOR HAD. GIVEN HIS BUDGET SPEECH AND TALK ABOUT A TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION OUR SURPLUS. DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING YOU'RE TO MY NOTES ARE YOU WANT TO GIVE FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION ANNUALLY RIGHT. I'M COMING UP WITH FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION SOME OF THE NUMBERS I'M LOOKING AT BUT YOU KNOW DID YOU DID YOU ASK HIM. FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR TO TAKE CARE OF THIS MY EYES AS YOU KNOW CENTER THAT THE SURPLUSES OF WAS A ONE TIME THING RIGHT SO SO WE'RE LOOKING. FOR I HAVE LONG TERM ONGOING -- EXPENDITURES -- BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF GOOD STUFF IT'S IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT RELATES TO THIS SORT OF WORK BUT THE THE ONLY THINK I MAKE A COMMITMENT THEY'RE ONLY WHAT THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO MAKE A COMMITMENT OF OF A YEAR TO I MEAN. THERE'S THERE'S NOT THE KIND OF LONG TERM COMMITMENT BECAUSE OF THE VOLATILITY OF OUR BUDGET. THE I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO COMMUNICATE IS SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT CENTER HERTZBERG DATA THAT IS. NOT LA LOOK AT LA AND AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A PARTIAL TAX REALLY UNIFIED. THERE'S FOUR MILLION VOTERS FOR YOU RIGHT THERE IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO TACK THAT ON SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WE THE TAX INCREASE. ONE OF THAT TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION OR SURPLUS AND SO THE DICHOTOMY -- JUST YEAH BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE THE ARE BUDGET GURU RAM YOU KNOW THAT THE SURPLUS IS A IS IT IS IT TEMPER IS AN EPHEMERAL THING RIGHT. RIGHT BUT IT'S ALSO A TOOL AND I I DON'T SEE A TEN YEAR PLAN. FOR WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THE YOU KNOW GOING OUT BUT IF IT DID YOU TAKE IT THIS IS A CRITICAL PRIORITY WHICH STARRED MAYBE START WITH ONE HUNDRED MILLION AND WORK OUR WAY UP TO SOMEWHERE TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES. AND I'M NOT SEEING THAT AT ALL I EITHER SO I THAT'S WHY I ASK. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THIS PROJECT OFFICER QUICKLY PLEASE THANK YOU -- UNDER EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN THE STATE IS PROVIDED. A TWO ENGINE FIFTY TWO ENGINE FORTY FIVE MILLION THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS TWO HUNDRED MILLION. MUCH OF THOSE FUNDS GOES TO THE CLEAN AIR TYPE OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. UNFORTUNATELY THAT MONEY IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY DISTRICT COMING TO ATTAINMENT. WE HAVE TO KEY DATES TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY THIRTY ONE AND THE ESTIMATED. OF FUNDS NECESSARY TO COME INTO ATTAINMENT FOR THAT IS ESTIMATED OVER BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ON SIX SEVENTEEN FOR THE SOUTH COAST AREA IS INSUFFICIENT WE ALSO OPPOSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE LOOKING AT PART OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. TO DEVELOP A CLEANER FIND THAT WOULD GO TO AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE EXTREME NON ATTAINMENT OR NON ATTAINMENT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT ASPECT AGAIN. WE ARE ONE OF ONLY TWO AREAS IN THE NATION THAT HAVE THIS EXTREME NON ATTAINMENT. AND SO I THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD REASON TO TO MOVE FORWARD. AND AND AND WOULD NOT ATTAINMENT A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD WITHHOLD BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDS IT COULD IMPOSE STRICT EMISSIONS REGULATIONS WITHOUT A PENNY OF INCENTIVES. TO AID IN REGIONAL COMPLIANCE AND AND ADD YOU KNOW GIVEN THE VOLATILITY WITH THE RELATIONS FELL GOVERNMENT I I WOULD BE IRONIC BUT BUT ACTUALLY TOTALLY POSSIBLE AND LIKELY.

A PUBLIC FINANCING OF THE STADIUM AND I WILL CLARIFY THAT SWITCH JUST LANGUAGE THAT MAKES IT CLEAR. WHAT THIS PROJECT IS? AND THEN -- THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS IN ITEM NINE OF THE ANALYSIS BUT ADDITIONALLY.

THANK YOU SO MUCH YEAH RIGHT THE FLOOR IS YOURS MA'AM IF YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU SEE OKAY SO -- THE I WON'T GO THROUGH THE STREETS IN THE ANALYSIS OF ARE WE THE LEGISLATURE'S ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE -- INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS -- WE HAVE MADE MANY MODIFICATIONS TO THEM. OVER THE YEARS I TO STREAMLINE THEM TO SOME DEGREE AND THIS BILL IN EFFECT -- IS SOMEWHAT OF A STREAMLINING FOR THE CITY OF OAKLAND TO ESTABLISH THE AN INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY FOR ALL THE COMPONENTS OF A PROJECT THAT WOULD INCLUDE A A BASEBALL STADIUM. NOW THE FINANCING ITSELF WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE USED FOR THE STADIUM THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE PUBLICLY FINANCED -- SO SPECIFICALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS PERMITS THE CITY OF OAKLAND TO FORM THE I FD FOUR AT THE HOWARD TERMINAL EXPANDS THE TERM FOR THE TAX AND PERMIT. FRUIT FORTY FIVE YEARS VERSUS THE THIRTY DEBTS IN THE ORIGINAL -- AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION FOR E. I. F. THESE -- ALLOWS FOR THE FINANCING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED BUT NOT THE FINANCING OF THE STADIUM. AND REMOVES THE VOTER APPROVAL FOR THE ISSUING OF BONDS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE I FD. NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH GOVERNOR NEWSOME IN HIS -- BUDGET PROPOSAL IS RECOMMENDED THAT WE LEFT THE VOTER APPROVALS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN -- DIE IF THESE AND WE HAVE THERE IS THIS -- MULTIPLE OTHER PRESIDENTS OF LEGISLATION WORD THESE VOTER APPROVALS WERE ELECTED -- AND WITH THAT I WILL ALLOW MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO SPEAK. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER SKINNER WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF LEAVE. I YES MY SERVER THE ETS AND I THINK WE HAVE THE CITY WONDERFUL YES SO MUCH.

THAT WERE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND THE BAY CONSERVATION DEVELOPING COMMISSION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROJECT -- FITS THEIR GUIDELINES AND AND NOTHING WE DO YOU SERVICE THEIR AUTHORITY SO THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND I KNOW THAT WAS ADDED TO THE BILL I ALSO WANT TO STRESS THIS IS THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC IMPACT. FIVE THOUSAND NEW JOBS AND ALSO A PROGRAM THAT COULD REALLY ENHANCE THE CAPABILITY THE MARITIME CAPABILITY OF THE PORT. BY DIVERSIFYING THEIR REVENUE STREAMS AND PROVIDING THE MONEY TO REINVEST AND SO THAT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS WE THINK THAT THERE CAN BE A PRIVATELY FINANCED BALLPARK.

VERY BRIEFLY THE SAME THING THAT MAKES THE WATERFRONT DESIRABLE FOR DEVELOPERS INCLUDING THE OAKLAND DAYS IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND IN THIS INSTANCE -- IS THE SAME -- MOTIVATION REQUIRES A TO BE PROTECTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S THE WATERFRONT -- DESIRABILITY OF THE WATERFRONT AND THE USES IN THE PROTECTIONS OF THE WATERFRONT STATE LAW WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. GO TO THE THE PREMISE THAT ONCE THE WATERFRONT IS GONE IT'S GONE -- WE NEED THE WATERFRONT FOR WATER DEPENDING USES -- AND SO IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL IN OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY IT UNDERMINES US SOME THE PROTECTIONS THAT -- WERE WRITTEN INTO LAW WHEN -- SENATOR HALL TWO SESSIONS AGO OFFERED SB SIXTY THREE WHICH WAS SPONSORED BY OR TO OUR ORGANIZATION TO CREATE SEAPORT A HALF DAYS -- THIS PROPERTY IS ACTUALLY. MANAGE UNDER THE SILENCE TRUSTS THROUGH GRANT BY THE STATE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- UNDER SB SIXTY THREE WHEN YOU'RE TAKING THESE TYPES OF PROPERTIES IN YOUR USING A INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT MECHANISM WHERE INVOLVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAX REVENUE. WE'VE ASKED FOR CLARIFICATIONS THAT THE REVENUE GOES BACK INTO THE TRUST THE GETS MANAGED BY THE TRUST -- AND THAT IT'S DONE INCONSISTENCY WITH -- PORT MASTER PLANNING OR AT PORT REQUEST FOR THAT DOCUMENT -- TO JUSTIFY THE IFP. AT FIRST GOING TO THE CITY COUNCIL BEFORE IT GETS APPROVED SO REGARDLESS OF THAT PROCESS THAT'S A CHECKED IT'S BUILT INTO OUR SYSTEM. THAT CHECK DOES NOT EXIST HERE -- THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF OAKLAND IS PLACED IN A DIRECT -- CONTROL OVER WHAT'S OCCURRING IN THIS PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROJECT ON PORT PROPERTY WHICH IS LIKELY TO RETAIN IN THE TRUSTS THE HEARD FROM A IS -- AND SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE THE SENATOR HAS -- HAS OUTLINED -- LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THE STAFF ON MAKING SURE THAT THE FINDINGS IN HERE -- ARE CONSISTENT WITH WITH WHAT SHE OFFERED AND AGAIN THANK HER FOR THAT -- THE WILL AND MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE ISSUES WITH THE UNDERLYING PROJECT BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THE THE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD.

GOING TO A LAST CALL LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WHAT WOULD I DO HAVE TO DO IS BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. WE LIKE TO BE TURNED OVER TO CENTER SKINNER TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS -- THE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE PROJECT AND THE ISSUE OF JOBS SO WHAT WE'RE INTERIOR JUST AS THOSE ITEMS CAME UP IN OPPOSITION. THERE'S CARE THE FLOOR'S YOURS AND WE ALSO WOULD WELCOME ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR FIRST WITNESSES TO BE TO COME JOIN IF YOU'D LIKE. SO -- MADAM SENATE FORESHORES. THANK YOU -- I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN OF DIAL W. IN TERMS OF A LOSS OF POTENTIAL LOSS OF PORT RELATED JOBS -- AND IT WOULD NOT BE MY INTEREST IN WHAT SO EVER TO HAVE ANY PORT RELATED JOBS LOST. THE PORT THE PORT OF OAKLAND IS. NOT ONLY THE CITY OF OAKLAND BUT ALMOST THE ENTIRE MY ENTIRE DISTRICT THAT STRIP FOR THE I AD CORRIDOR. THE ECONOMIC ENGINE FOR THAT ENTIRE AREA -- WE ARE AS WAS MENTIONED THE THIRD LARGEST PORT -- WE MOVE A PHENOMENAL AMOUNT OF GOODS THE AMOUNT OF CONTRACTS RELATED TO THE DIFFERENT. WORK AFFECTED BY THE THAT YOU KNOW GENERATED BY THE PORT IS I SAID IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC ENGINE. AND VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER JOBS AND IT WOULD BE -- IT WOULD BE CUTTING YOUR NOSE OFF TO SPITE YOUR FACE IF YOU'RE THE CITY OF OAKLAND TO IN ANY WAY. LESSEN THE JOBS AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND SO. IT IS CERTAINLY MY COMMITMENT IN INTERACTING WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT IF THIS PROJECT PROCEEDS AND CLEARLY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE I FD DOES NOT GUARANTEE THIS PROJECT THERE ARE SO MANY LEVELS. THIS PROJECT STILL HAS TO GO THROUGH -- BUT AS YOU NOTICED IN THIS IS NOT I'M SURE MIKE MY FRIENDS FROM I'LL W. YOU THE FACT THAT THE PORT OF OAKLAND SUPPORTS THE BILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY GIVE THEM -- THE ASSURANCE THAT THEIR JOBS WOULD BE AFFECTED SO I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT THE PORT OF OAKLAND SUPPORT GIVES THEM THAT ASSURANCE. BUT CERTAINLY -- IT IS MY INTENT AS I WORK WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND IF THIS PROJECT MOVES FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES NOT IMPACT PORT OPERATIONS IN A WAY THAT WOULD. LESSEN JOBS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF THE SENATOR CENTRE BELL [inaudible] OKAY. THE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING JUST RECRUITED IS A SINGLE PURPOSE FOR THIS PURPOSE RIGHT. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS BILL [inaudible] AND THE CURRENT. CURRENT LAW FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS. AND WE DID MENTION A REPORT WE HAVE A BILL -- THAT THE COMMITTEE APPROVED AND WAS APPROVED ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE [inaudible] RECENTLY. TO ELIMINATE THE VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS IS -- SB. ONE TWENTY EIGHT SO SO -- THAT'S GOING TO ASSEMBLY NOW SO -- SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S -- DIFFERENCE SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO DIFFERENTLY HERE CERTAINLY THIS BILL. WOULD -- SO IF IF THE BILL THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE VOTING REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS A STANDALONE IS SUCCESSFUL -- THEN OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BENEFIT THIS PROJECT BUT NOT KNOWING -- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE WILL MAKE IT AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS. ELIMINATE THAT VOTING REQUIREMENT FOR THIS PROJECT CONSISTENT WITH THE BILL THAT WOULD DO THAT FOR EVERYONE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATION THAT SUCH VOTING REQUIREMENTS BE ELIMINATED -- BUT AT LEAST THIS ASSOCIATES WITH THIS PARTICULAR ESTABLISHMENT BUT ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR A FORTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD FOR THE TAX INCREMENTS VERSUS JUST THIRTY SO THOSE OF THE KEY REASONS WHY WE NEED A BILL RIGHT NOW. AND I'LL JUST MENTION IT IS THAT THE PROCESS. THAT IS BEING PROPOSED -- FOR THE AMENDMENT IN THE BEGINNING IT IS IDENTICAL TO THE TO WHAT WAS IN SENATOR BELLS BILL -- WHEN IT CAME THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE DIFFERENT SECTIONS A LAW BUT IDENTICAL PROCESS -- THAT'S BEING PRESENTED HEARING COMMITTEE. CENTER ABOUT. OKAY SO -- THE JOB LOSS ISSUE YOU SAID NO JOB LOSSES AT SOME KIND OF BOYS THOUGH AS FOR THE AS SO MANY THINGS -- MY SO THIS. THE HOWARD TERMINAL IS ON THE WATERFRONT. BUT IT IS NOT DIRECTLY A PORTION OF THE PORTS OPERATIONS NOW THERE'S CONCERN CLEARLY EXPRESSED BY -- W. AND EXPRESSED BY THE PACIFIC MARITIME SHIPPING ASSOCIATION THAT IF THE CITY WERE TO PROCEED WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT DATE IT WOULD IMPACT PORT OPERATIONS. NOW CLEARLY AS I STATED BEFORE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DISTRICT DOES NOT. IT'S ESTABLISHMENT OF FINANCING DISTRICT DID NOT GIVE A GREEN LIGHT TO THE PROJECT AND THERE WILL BE -- THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES IN ADDITION TO THE CITY COUNCIL HAVING TO VOTE. THAT CAN ADD ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS -- TO TO THE PORT OPERATION OFF AND I WOULD CERTAINLY EXPECT THEM I WOULD I I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL BE INCLUDED IN IT IF THIS THING MOVES FORWARD. AND N. WORD WERE INVESTING -- A LOT OF THE STATE SB ONE FUNDS AND THE REGIONAL TOLL BRIDGE. INCREASE THERE WAS PASSED IN THE BAY AREA IS PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY INTO THE PORT ACCESS. AS WELL SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A OF GOOD CHUNK OF MONEY. TO DO THE PORT AND DOES THE CITY OF OAKLAND. CONTEMPLATE -- DOING INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAS BEEN DISTRICT ACTIVITY OR SOME KIND OF OTHER. FINANCING IN THE PORT OF OAKLAND. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BRAND NEW. IT HAS ACCESS TO THE PORT OR THE YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY PLANS -- FOR I'M NOT SURE THOUGH THE THE ACTUAL PORT LANSING PORT OPERATIONS ARE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE PORT AUTHORITY -- BUT I'M NOT REALLY TALK TO ABOUT -- LIKE TO KNOW BECAUSE OF A BUT A LOT OF FUN TO FIND OUT. FOR YOURSELF YEAH BEST THING A LOT OF MONEY AND THE RIGHT NOT WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION FUNDS -- YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE THE PORTS SUCCESSFUL THAT'S WHERE WERE PUT. REPORT LIKE TRUCKING OVERPASSES SO THEY GO RIGHT INTO THE BOARD BUT THE OTHER THE ALL KINDS OF OTHER IMPROVEMENTS SO THE PORT. CAN FUNCTION -- MORE EFFICIENTLY SO THAT'S THE POOL. SO YOU KNOW I JUST YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT WITHIN YOU HAVE IN THE WORK THE SHIPPERS SO BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE. AND UNION HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. WE ALL WORK TOGETHER ON SB ONE SO WE KIND OF WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. FOR A PORT. IT WILL ENSURE BY A COMMITTEE WILL WORK WITH TENNIS SKINNER'S OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH. A CENTER ABOUT THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE ON THAT SUBJECT AS WELL. LET ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR IF THERE IS A MOTION. ON SENATE BILL. TWO NINETY THREE RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR HER TITLE -- I'M GONNA PROVIDE SENIOR SKINNER WITH AN OPPORTUNITY OF DO CLOSING STATEMENT I'D LIKE TO RECESS -- FOR THIRTY SECONDS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN SAME PAGE ON THE LEDGER ON THE LANGUAGE. FOR PERFORATIONS JUST BEFORE WE MOVE ON THAT BUT LIKE TO BETTER TURN OVER TO THE COULD SENATOR FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. ONE QUICK QUESTION. ARE THERE ANY RESIDENTS IN THIS. I'M ASSUMING NO RESIDENTS IN ME IN THE AREA WHERE THIS PROJECT TO BE NO BUT LITERALLY ACROSS THERE'S TRAIN TRACKS RIGHT ALONG THERE WHICH OF COURSE SERVICE SUPPORT. YEAH RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE TRAIN WRECK LITERALLY ALMOST ON THE TRAIN TRACKS WELL NOT ON BUT VERY VERY CLOSE FIGHT IS HOUSING. YEAH. YOU MIGHT. PLEASE THERE'S TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN A MILE OF THE LOCATION WHERE THE BALLPARK IS PROPOSED SO THERE IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THERE ARE READY. THANK YOU THANK. MIKE. SO I'M JUST GONNA ASK FOR FOLKS WHO ARE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE AND I DO APOLOGIZE RISK CAN ASK -- WE HAD PUBLIC COMING. ANDERSON THERE MAY BE SOME CONCERN OR DISAGREEMENT BUT I'M JUST GONNA ASKED WE CAN ALL BE RESPECTFUL. I THINK JUST TO CLARIFY WITH. CERTAINLY WITHIN THE PROJECT AREA AND PROXIMATE TO THE PROJECT AREA -- IMMEDIATELY CONTINUOUS. THAT IS AN INDUSTRIAL BUFFERS ON WE HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THE INTRODUCTION OF HOUSING IN THIS PROJECT -- AND THAT IS PRIMARILY THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION COMPLIANCE -- INCONSISTENCY CRITERIA WITH RESPECT TO THE EXISTING REINVESTMENT OF FUND. SO THAT WILL BE A A CONTINUING ISSUE -- CENTER MORE LOCK -- AND% CIVIL CENTER SKINNER -- AND MISTER KELLER CORRECT WITH IN THE JACQUELINE SQUARE AREA THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RESIDENCES. BUT WE HAVE AN EXPLICIT. A BUFFER ZONE IN THIS TERMINAL IS PART OF THE BUFFER ZONE -- IN IN AND PASS IT'S BEEN OPERATING MARINE TERMINAL FOR SIP TO SHORE BUT NOW IT'S STILL AN OPERATING MARINE TERMINAL ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT HAVE SHIP TO SHORE -- WE HAVE A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DIFFERENT TRUCK TRANSACTIONS A YEAR ON THE TERMINAL. SO IT'S USED FOR DIFFERENT THINGS THERE'S A MIX OF USES HOUSING IS NEARBY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AS A SANDERS SAID ON THE TRACKS AND JACQUELINE SQUARE -- BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE THE EXPANSION OF HOUSING USES INTO OUR INDUSTRIAL AREA. AND TOSE ARE WHAT WE FEEL ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH WITH THE PROJECT MOVING [inaudible] FOR REALLY. REASON I ASK IS. THE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES TWO THIRDS OF VOTERS WITHIN THE DISTRICT APPROVED BY INSURANCE BUT IF YOU HAVE NO VOTERS. SO THE AVERAGE JUST. RIGHT YEAH AND THAT THAT'S A NATION ARSENAL TYPE TAX. THAT'S RIGHT OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT'S THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY CONTEMPLATED IN THE SEAPORT AYE IF THESE -- SO. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THAT WORKS OUT WITH THE CHANGES WITH RESPECT TO THE VOTE REQUIREMENTS BUT IN THE SEAPORT I HAVE TO USE THE POSSESSORY INTERESTS HOLDERS. ACTUALLY ACT AS THE THE VOTING BODY WITH RESPECT TO THE UNDERWRITING OF DIE OFF THE APPROVAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SO MUCH AS VICE CHAIR. WE LIKE TO BETTER PROVIDE SEAMLESS CARE WITH AN ABILITY TO CLOSE. I APPRECIATE DISCUSSION AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS AS I LAID OUT NOT THE ONE THAT WE WOULD TAKE AN APPROACH I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO BE TO TAKE A THIRTY SECOND RECESS SO -- CENTER SKINNER NIKE'S LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IN THIS ONE MAKE SURE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH YOUR THINKING AS ELL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK THE YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. ALL RIGHT LAYS IN GERMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE SO AGAIN AT CENTER SKINNER OPENLY OUTLINED THE LIMITS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN. IN COMMITTEE TODAY WHICH WERE NOT GOING TO REPEAT. THIS BILL -- IT HAS A MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FLOOR. AND A CENTER SKINNER WILL BE TAKING THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENT ON THE FLOOR I'M GONNA READ IT IT IS NOT IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY IN THIS COMMITTEE IS NOT CONSIDERING -- THIS AMENDMENT IT WILL BE ON THE FLOOR IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIS DISTRICT IS NOT OVERRIDE THE AUTHORITY OF THE BAY CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT -- COMMISSION IN THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION.
