POSSIBLY- AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:45.108
THE INTENT OF THIS CALIFORNIA

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:47.177
STATE LAW. SEPARATE FROM THIS-

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:49.346

JUST TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE IS

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:52.149
A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ASK A

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:53.683
TRUSTED ADULT WHO HAS A

NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING.

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:02.058
AND I ALWAYS- ENCOURAGED THAT WE

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:03.994
BRING THAT CONVERSATION BACK TO

THE PARENTS. AND OFTEN OFFER TO

SERVICES WORK I. PUT IN IS THAT

00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:23.480
IT GOT CARVED OUT FROM

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.482
TRADITIONAL INSURANCE AND SO

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:28.118
MEDIKAL HAS PROTECTION AROUND

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:30.454
SENSITIVE SERVICES. SO THAT

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.488
THERE WOULDN'T BE BILLING ON THE

00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:40.831
THE WAY THE INSURANCE PIECE HAS

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:43.266

INTO THEIR CAR OR PROTESTING IN

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.463
FRONT OF THEIR HOMES. I'VE

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.666
SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL LEVEL

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:45.800
INVOLVES YOU'RE ON THE BOARD OF

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.736

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:58.212
THERE'S A BALANCE HERE. I DON'T

01:26:58.279 --> 01:27:00.415
UNDERSTAND WHY THE STATE IS

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:03.184
UNDERTAKING THIS WHEN LOCAL

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:06.287

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:24.806
IMPORTANCE TO THIS MESSAGE. BUT

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:26.007
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.710
THIS IS A STATE RULE THAT NEEDS

01:27:28.776 --> 01:27:29.544
TO BE PROMULGATED WHEN

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:37.118

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.008
SENATOR WIENER I THINK CUT TO

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:45.012
THE CHASE AND REALLY ELEGANTLY-

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:46.981
I MADE THE POINT ABOUT THIS

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:49.484
BILL. WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF IT

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:51.719
. WE IN GOVERNMENT ENGAGING THE

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:54.856
HEARING PROCESS TO- DISCUSS

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:57.091
DEMOCRACY TO HAVE EVERYBODY'S

01:29:57.158 --> 01:30:05.500
POINTS

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:08.503
SHOULD BE TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:10.605
AND TO AVOID FOLKS INTERRUPTING

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:11.973
THAT DEMOCRATIC DELIBERATIVE

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:14.542
pPROCESS EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:15.676
TO PROTEST DISCUSSION ANYWAY

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:18.146
THEN THEY THEY WANT TO MAKE IT

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:19.914
HOME FOR A- CENTER WHERE TO

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.382
FURTHER MAKE THIS POINT BREAK

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:22.683
JUST **** PERMISSION BECAUSE I

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.318
WANT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR IT

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:26.320
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MAKES THE

01:30:26.387 --> 01:30:26.954
POINT ELEGANTLY. IN THE SENSE

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:28.156
THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY PRO

01:30:28.222 --> 01:30:29.891
DEMOCRACY AT ITS GREATEST

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.692
BECAUSE FOLKS COME INTO A ROOM

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:33.227
AND THEY IN FACT WANT TO SHUT

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:34.362
DOWN THE DILUTES THE

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:37.698
DELIBERATION- AND NOT. MAKE SURE

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:38.900
THAT FOLKS ENGAGE IN THE

01:30:38.966 --> 01:30:42.336
DISCUSSION SO. SHORT AT THAT

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:44.372
THOUGHT. GLAZER HERTZBERG SAID

01:30:44.438 --> 01:30:45.506
EARLIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:48.309
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RESPOND

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:50.244
TO A PREVIOUS COMMENT BECAUSE-

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:52.413
IT WAS STATED THAT IT SHOULD BE

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.982
UP TO THE PERSON PRESIDING AT

01:30:55.049 --> 01:30:55.783
THE MEETING IT LOCAL

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:57.919
GOVERNMENTS. I WAS EXACTLY THAT

01:30:57.985 --> 01:31:01.122
PERSON. I WAS THE MAYOR. AT A

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:05.493
TIME. THAT A FULL ROOM LIKE THIS

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.829
SHOUTED US DOWN FOR AN HOUR AND

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.330
A HALF IN A BUDGET HEARING. AND

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:11.332
OUR CITY ATTORNEY ADVISED US WE

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:14.101
HAD NO RECOURSE BUT TO ALLOW IT

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:16.170
TO HAPPEN AND WE HAD TO SIT

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.505
THERE. WE COULDN'T HEAR BETWEEN

01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:19.073
US WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.408
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC STANDING

01:31:20.474 --> 01:31:23.077
AT THE PODIUM THAT COULD BARELY

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.279
AND GENERALLY NOT BE HEARD. BY

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:27.481
US AND OUR ATTORNEY ADVISED US

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:30.484
WE HAD NO RECOURSE. AND SO. WHEN

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:33.054
IT IS SAID THAT THAT A CHAIR OF

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.655
A OF A MEETING COULD COULD DO

01:31:34.722 --> 01:31:37.024
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT RIGHT

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:38.259
AND I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:40.328
HERE. THE END IN THE KEY ISSUE

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:42.430
WILL BE AS THIS BILL MOVES IS

01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:43.898
HOW YOU DRAW THE DISTINCTION

01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:45.867
BETWEEN FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND

01:31:45.933 --> 01:31:48.369
DISRUPTION AND ENDED AT THE

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:50.338
AUTHOR OR AUTHORS HAVE GONE

01:31:50.404 --> 01:31:51.973
ADDED IN A GOOD WAY AND MAYBE

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:53.407
THEY'LL BE QUESTIONS. BUT THERE

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:56.244
WAS NOT THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:59.080
AND I CAN'T DESCRIBE. I'VE HAD

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:01.749
THAT MANY WEIRD MOMENTS IT IS

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:03.818
FOUR OR ELECTED THING OVER THE

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:06.020
SPAN OF FORTY YEARS BUT THAT WAS

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:07.755
ONE OF THE WORST BECAUSE- YOU

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:10.124
JUST POWERLESS YOU JUST BEING

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.226
COMPLETELY SHUT IT DOWN YOU HAD

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:14.495
NO CONTROL. THERE WAS NO RESPECT

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:15.696
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:17.465
THAT WAS NOT EXPRESSING AN

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:19.267
OPINION THAT WAS NOT A COMMENT

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:20.902
THAT WAS AT A PODIUM IT WAS JUST

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:23.004
LITERALLY SHOUTED THE ENTIRE

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:25.573
TIME AND SO. I THINK THAT IS

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:31.178
WHAT THIS BILL. IS ADDRESSING.

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:33.814
THANK YOU SIR- JONES CENTER WHAT

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:37.685
CAL SKI. THANK YOU CHAIR AND

YOUR TIME. VERY STRONG DIALOGUE-

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:44.091
THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN YOUR

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:45.526
OPENING REMARKS ACT I DO AGREE

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:47.762
WITH- YOU MENTIONED THAT THESE

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:50.731
CASES ARE LIMITED AND RARE AND I

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:52.867
WOULD I THINK THAT THAT'S I

01:32:52.934 --> 01:32:54.869
THINK THAT'S TRUE ESPECIALLY

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:57.605
HERE IN CALIFORNIA- I THINK

01:32:57.672 --> 01:33:00.141
WHAT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE OF

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:01.242
SOCIAL MEDIA TWENTY FOUR HOUR

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:03.144
NEWS CYCLE AS THOSE LIMITED A

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:04.712
RARE OCCASIONS HAVE BEEN

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:07.782
SENSATIONALIZED BY THE MEDIA BY

01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:11.619
ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND HAS

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:14.989
DEVOLVED TO THOSE SITUATIONS ARE

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:16.791
ELEVATED MAYBE MIGHT BE A BETTER

01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:20.494
TERM TWO ELSEWHERE. PEOPLE ARE

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:22.496
ASSUMING THAT THAT'S THE GENERAL

01:33:22.563 --> 01:33:24.198
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.266
MEETINGS I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:27.134
THE CASE- I THINK THAT WE DO

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:29.203
HAVE ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED-

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.205
WITH THE BROWN ACT AND WITH THE

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:32.907
FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE U. S.

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:34.942
CONSTITUTION. I DO WANT TO BE IN

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:36.177
A RECOGNIZE THE TWO SPEAKERS

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:38.512
THAT SPOKE IN OPPOSITION TO THE

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:40.514
BILL I THOUGHT THAT THE VERY

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:43.084
ELOQUENTLY AND GRACIOUSLY

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:44.752
PRESENTED THEIR POSITION TODAY.

01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:46.988
BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO YOU

KNOW WHAT I THINK IS. THE NUMBER

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:52.326
ONE TOOL WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:53.894
THE SITUATION IN THESE PUBLIC

01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:57.098
MEETINGS. AND IN CENTER LEARNED

01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:59.133
NOT TO BE SNARKY WIT. IF I GET A

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.035
NEW CITY ATTORNEY YOU KNOW IF

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:02.903
THAT WAS MY SITUATION- AND I'VE

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:05.072
BEEN ON THE CITY YOU KNOW I'VE

01:34:05.139 --> 01:34:06.707
BEEN A CITY COUNCIL- WE'VE HAD

01:34:06.774 --> 01:34:07.975
YOU KNOW MY THE CITY THAT HAS ON

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:10.745
THE CITY COUNCIL WE HAD A SPLIT

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.013
IN THE CITY BETWEEN. FOLKS THAT

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:14.115
WANTED THE CITY TO DEVELOP AND

01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:15.016
FOLKS THAT DIDN'T WANT THE CITY

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.851
TO DEVELOP AND- WHEN THERE WAS

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:18.586
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS COMING UP.

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:21.856
YOU KNOW WE GOT A VERY HEATED

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:23.657
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT. BUT I'M

01:34:23.724 --> 01:34:27.361
OFTEN AMAZED BY THE FORESIGHT

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:28.929
AND THE INTELLECT OF OUR

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:30.498
FOUNDING FATHERS WHEN THEY WROTE

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:32.133
THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:33.768
CONSTITUTION THEY WROTE THE

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:36.270
RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE PEACEABLY TO

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.806
ASSEMBLE AND TO PETITION THE

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:40.207
GOVERNMENT FOR A REDRESS OF

01:34:40.274 --> 01:34:43.077
GOVERNMENT GRIEVANCES. I JUST

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:45.279
IMAGINE IF WHEN THEY WROTE THAT

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:46.747
. FIRST AMENDMENT IF THEY JUST

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:49.116
LEFT OUT THE WORD PEACEABLE. AND

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:50.918
I THINK ALL OF OUR MEETINGS AND

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:52.219
ALL OF OUR INTERACTION BETWEEN

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:54.255
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:55.356
HINGED ON THAT ONE WORD

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:58.492
PEACEABLE. AND AS SOON AS I

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.661
THINK THAT'S THE GOVERNING

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:03.764
CONCEPT. IN THESE MEETINGS AS

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:07.501
LONG AS THE INTERACTION WITH THE

01:35:07.568 --> 01:35:08.335
PUBLIC AT THESE MEETINGS IS

01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:10.738
PEACEABLE. AS ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:13.240
WE HAVE A DUTY. TO STAY THERE

01:35:13.307 --> 01:35:16.710
AND LISTEN AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

01:35:16.777 --> 01:35:18.279
BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT AS

01:35:18.345 --> 01:35:21.082
SOON AS THE THAT TURNOUT BECOMES

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:23.651
UNFEASIBLE. THE PRESIDING

01:35:23.717 --> 01:35:26.020
OFFICER OF THAT MEETING HAS THE

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:28.222
AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY. TO

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:29.890
REMOVE THOSE ON PEACEABLE

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:32.660
MEMBERS FROM THAT ASSEMBLY AND I

01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:34.562
THINK IT'S IS CLEAR IN AS CLEAN

01:35:34.628 --> 01:35:36.497
AS THAT- AND I'LL WRAP UP WITH

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:37.898
THIS I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:39.233
FRUSTRATION FROM THE PUBLIC IN

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.168
DEALING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.837

BUT THERE'S FORTY MILLION PEOPLE

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:54.315
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:56.117
ALL FORTY MILLION PEOPLE HAVE

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:58.819
THAT RIGHT TO COME AND SPEAK TO

01:35:58.886 --> 01:36:02.056
US ON THIS DYESS. BUT IT IS IT'S

01:36:02.123 --> 01:36:05.025
NOT TENABLE FOR US TO GIVE

POTENTIALLY VIOLENT SITUATION

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:44.351

RULE. AND THAT IS NOT HOW WE

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:51.425

THEY ARE. THEIR FEAR ABOUT HOW

01:39:13.047 --> 01:39:15.949
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE

01:39:16.016 --> 01:39:18.719

SCARED TO GO AND MAKE PUBLIC

01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:32.333

IF THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:44.011

ANALYSIS WELL THE TEXT OF THE

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:04.625
BILL ON THIS IS NOT AN OPEN

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.059
ENDED- REQUIREMENT THE DIFF THE

THESE AND- OF THIS OF THIS

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:19.139
SPEECH I THINK THE BILL TAILORS

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:21.708
ITSELF NARROWLY TO THAT- AND

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:23.544
THEREFORE IN MY VIEW. SHOULD

TO SAY THE WITH THE WITH WITH

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.486
VOTING ON THIS BILL I DO THINK

01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:33.754
WE SHOULD OBLIGATE OURSELVES. TO

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.055
LOOKING FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:37.157
TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC.

01:41:37.224 --> 01:41:39.059
I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT A LOT

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:40.227
OF THE REMOTE HEARING

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:42.229
PARTICIPATION IS GOING TO SEIZE-

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:44.298

ATTEND MEETINGS CAN BE LIMITED

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:48.902
BASED ON INCOME OR WHEN THEY ARE

01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:50.737
WORKING PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE AND

01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:52.306
CAN'T GO TO A MEETING. WE HAD

01:41:52.372 --> 01:41:54.208
LEGISLATION PENDING FOR THIS

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:55.075

SO. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE

01:42:05.352 --> 01:42:06.053
TRYING TO ENSURE PEACE

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:08.322
STABILITY. AND HAVING SOME KIND

01:42:08.388 --> 01:42:10.924

OBLIGATION TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR

FOLKS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND I

01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:20.534
THINK THERE ARE OPPRTUNITIES TO

01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:21.869
DO THAT BOTH ON DIGITAL

01:42:21.935 --> 01:42:23.437
PLATFORMS WHERE PEOPLE CAN

01:50:04.864 --> 01:50:07.033
TRUE STILL TODAY. IN STATE

WADE AND THE REAL REPRODUCTIVE

01:50:30.023 --> 01:50:31.891
FREEDOM IN AMERICA IS BIGGER

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:34.327

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:36.329
A VERY REAL IMPACT ON THE LIVES

01:50:36.396 --> 01:50:37.764

01:50:37.831 --> 01:50:39.899
INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES.

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.067

WEIGHT OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN WHO

01:50:42.736 --> 01:50:44.270

THEIR OWN BODIES. IT'S A

01:50:45.638 --> 01:50:47.507
DECISION THAT WILL IMPACT WOMEN

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:50.143
FAMILIES AND OUR COUNTRY FOR

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:51.678
DECADES TO COME. IT'S ONE WE

01:50:51.745 --> 01:50:53.146
NEED TO PREPARE FOR IN EVERY WAY

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:56.016

PROVIDE ABORTIONS WITHOUT THE

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:06.092
SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR. SB

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:06.926
THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE IS A

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:08.261
PROACTIVE STEP TO FURTHER

01:51:08.328 --> 01:51:10.263
INCREASE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:11.798
QUALITY REPRODUCTIVE CARE IN

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:14.300
CALIFORNIA. OUR STATE IS FACING

01:51:14.367 --> 01:51:16.302
A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY

01:51:16.369 --> 01:51:18.505
CARE CLINICIANS ESPECIALLY. IN

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:20.006
SOME OF OUR LATINO BLACK AND

01:51:20.073 --> 01:51:21.541
NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES A

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:23.143
PROBLEM THAT'S EXPECTED TO GET

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:25.211
EVEN MORE DIRE OVER THE NEXT TEN

01:51:25.278 --> 01:51:27.981
YEARS. CURRENTLY OVER 40% OF

01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:29.549
COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T

01:51:29.616 --> 01:51:31.751
EVEN HAVE CLINICS THAT PROVIDE

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:33.887
ABORTIONS. THOSE TWO FACTORS

01:51:33.953 --> 01:51:35.021
COMBINED MEAN THAT FAR TOO MANY

01:51:35.088 --> 01:51:36.790
PREGNANT PEOPLE WHO MAY NEED TO

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:38.291
CONSIDER ABORTION AS AN OPTION

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:45.365
CANNOT DO SO. CALIFORNIA HAS

PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES SO THIS IS

02:35:05.062 --> 02:35:07.564

TOOL TO EVALUATE RISK HOWEVER

02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:28.652
POUCH HOUSING VOUCHERS PAY UP

02:35:28.719 --> 02:35:30.721
270% OF THAT RENT. BUT LEAVING

02:35:30.788 --> 02:35:33.624
THE SENATE ONLY TO PAY 30% AND

02:35:33.691 --> 02:35:34.825
THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO THE TENANT

02:35:34.892 --> 02:35:35.926
DOESN'T GO THE TENET THEN TO

02:35:35.993 --> 02:35:38.162

02:35:39.396 --> 02:35:42.366
ALREADY REALLY REDUCING THE RISK

02:35:42.433 --> 02:35:44.134
OF NON PAYMENTS- SO A PERSON'S

02:35:44.201 --> 02:35:45.369
CREDIT SCORE WOULD NOT BE

02:35:45.436 --> 02:35:47.271
REFLECTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO IT

02:35:47.337 --> 02:35:48.138

ABLE TO BE. DEPENDABLE SO THIS

02:35:51.308 --> 02:35:52.576

02:35:52.643 --> 02:35:53.944
ADDITIONAL TO THAT TO THE CREDIT

02:35:54.011 --> 02:35:56.046

THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY THE

02:35:58.549 --> 02:36:00.350
RENT. AND THEN HAVE ONE MORE

02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:01.952

TO A AUTHOR. REPAIR SHOP AND

03:14:10.171 --> 03:14:12.240
THEY ALWAYS ENDED UP BEING SMALL

03:14:12.307 --> 03:14:13.575
SMALL REPAIR SHOPS WITH THEIR

03:14:13.641 --> 03:14:16.711
AUTHORIZES I FELT MORE CONFIDENT

03:14:16.778 --> 03:14:19.547
THAT THEY WERE GONNA HAVE THE

03:14:19.614 --> 03:14:22.617
TOOLS AND THEY WERE GOING TO USE

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:23.818
THE RIGHT CARD SINCE THAT. A

03:14:23.885 --> 03:14:27.622
LESS OF A CHANCE ON IT- I STILL

03:14:31.393 --> 03:14:37.132

03:14:42.337 --> 03:14:45.173
PRIORITY IF THEY'RE A SHOP THAT

03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:47.208
HAS THE CONNECTION OR THE

03:14:47.275 --> 03:14:49.144
AUTHORIZATION FROM FROM THE

03:14:49.210 --> 03:14:51.946
ORIGINAL COMPANY I DON'T KNOW IT

03:14:52.013 --> 03:14:54.682
JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A PLACE

03:14:54.749 --> 03:14:55.950
FOR ANY SHOP TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

03:14:56.017 --> 03:14:57.752
THE REPAIRS BUT THERE'S

03:14:57.819 --> 03:14:59.020
SOMETHING THAT GIVES AN

03:14:59.087 --> 03:15:00.889
ADVANTAGE TO THOSE THAT ARE

03:15:00.955 --> 03:15:04.192
AUTHORIZED HAD JUST. TO THROWING

03:15:04.259 --> 03:15:05.794
THAT OUT. AND NOTHING IN THIS

03:15:05.860 --> 03:15:07.028
BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T GO TO

03:15:07.095 --> 03:15:08.863
WHOMEVER YOU WANT YOU CAN STILL

03:15:08.930 --> 03:15:10.799
GO TO THE TO THE AUTHORIZED

03:15:10.865 --> 03:15:13.268
DEALER YOU CAN STILL GO TO. THE

03:15:13.334 --> 03:15:14.436
BACK TO THE COMPANY YOU CAN

03:15:14.502 --> 03:15:15.970
STILL DO ALL THOSE THINGS THIS

03:15:16.037 --> 03:15:17.205
IS JUST SAYING THAT FOR THOSE

03:15:17.272 --> 03:15:19.074
WHO WANT TO GO TO A DIFFERENT

03:15:19.140 --> 03:15:22.410
MOM AND POP SHOP IN THEIR

03:15:22.477 --> 03:15:24.312
NEIGHBORHOOD IN THEIR COMMUNITY

03:15:24.379 --> 03:15:26.548
IN THE HOME BOYS. THAT THEY

03:15:26.614 --> 03:15:28.416
WOULD ALL. MOST TWO PURCHASE A

03:15:28.483 --> 03:15:31.119
THE MANUALS DYSKINETIC TO BE

03:15:31.186 --> 03:15:33.855
ABLE TO FIX IT I MEAN IT'S- BUT

03:15:33.922 --> 03:15:36.724
YOU CAN STILL GO TO THE OTHERS.

03:15:36.791 --> 03:15:37.892
IS IT BECAUSE THAT WAS AT THE

03:15:37.959 --> 03:15:40.595
QUESTION. NOT REALLY WELL JUST

03:15:40.662 --> 03:15:41.863
TO BE CLEAR SAID I CAN ASSUME

03:15:41.930 --> 03:15:43.465
YOU'RE ACCEPTING A COMMITTEE YES

03:15:43.531 --> 03:15:45.166
I ANSWER SUGGESTED AND TO

03:15:45.233 --> 03:15:47.368
RESPOND TO THE SENATE ALSO

03:15:47.435 --> 03:15:49.604
QUESTION. IS IT IF YOU ARE NOT

03:15:49.671 --> 03:15:51.206
AN AUTHORIZED DEALER YOU'VE GOT

03:15:51.272 --> 03:15:53.141
TO DISCLOSE THAT SO TO THE

03:15:53.208 --> 03:15:54.642
EXTENT THAT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER

03:15:54.709 --> 03:15:57.278
MAY HAVE SOME ADVANTAGE IN THE

03:15:57.345 --> 03:15:59.948
MARKETPLACE OF BY VIRTUE OF THE

03:16:00.014 --> 03:16:00.849
FACT THAT THAT THE IN AN

03:16:00.915 --> 03:16:02.784
AUTHORIZED DEALER MUST DISCLOSE

03:16:02.851 --> 03:16:04.886
THAT TO THE CONSUMER. SO THEY'RE

03:16:04.953 --> 03:16:06.988
AWARE THAT THAT THAT DEVICE OR

03:16:07.055 --> 03:16:08.223
PRODUCT IS BEING REPAIRED BY

03:16:08.289 --> 03:16:09.991
SOMEONE AUTHORIZED THAT THAT

03:16:10.058 --> 03:16:13.261
THAT MAY PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT IN

03:16:13.328 --> 03:16:16.297
THE MARKET SO. OTHER QUESTIONS

03:16:16.364 --> 03:16:19.400
SIMILAR BORDERS. I CAN WRESTLE

03:16:19.467 --> 03:16:22.237
WITH THIS WITH THIS ONE- MY WIFE

03:16:22.303 --> 03:16:24.772
BOUGHT ME A WATCH- IT WAS IT WAS

03:16:24.839 --> 03:16:30.111
A NICE WATCH- AND I JUST WANTED-TO GET A REPAIR THAT WAS A

03:16:30.178 --> 03:16:33.014
MISTAKE- AND- I GOT IT REPAIRED.

03:16:33.081 --> 03:16:35.316
AND THEN I WANT TO GO BACK TO

03:16:35.383 --> 03:16:36.351
THE MANUFACTURER AND THEY'RE

03:16:36.417 --> 03:16:39.187
LIKE OOPS SORRY WARRANTY VOIDED

03:16:39.254 --> 03:16:41.055
BECAUSE YOU WENT TO. BUT THIS

03:16:41.122 --> 03:16:44.259
JURY PAYER WHATEVER IT WAS- I

03:16:44.325 --> 03:16:47.529
WAS LIKE WOW. THAT IS A PROBLEM-

03:16:47.595 --> 03:16:50.965
SO WE- HEY YOU GUYS HAVEN'T BEEN

03:16:51.032 --> 03:16:53.701
A PUBLIC JONES TO REPAIR SHOP

03:16:53.768 --> 03:16:58.106
YOU SHOULD. ANYWAY MY POINT IS

03:16:58.173 --> 03:17:00.141
ALL THIS IS- I THINK THERE'S A

03:17:00.208 --> 03:17:02.844
BIG DISCONNECT- WE HAVE COTTAGE

03:17:02.911 --> 03:17:04.679
INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED

03:17:04.746 --> 03:17:06.047
BASED ON EXCLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS

03:17:06.114 --> 03:17:09.317
WITH MANUFACTURERS AND THERE'S

03:17:09.384 --> 03:17:12.587
BENEFITS TO THAT BUT THERE'S

03:17:12.654 --> 03:17:13.221
ALSO SUBSTANTIAL CONSUMER DRAW.

03:17:13.288 --> 03:17:15.557
AIR THE COMMENTS THAT- I THINK

03:17:15.623 --> 03:17:17.859
ONE OF YOUR TEST FIRES- ALLUDED

03:17:17.926 --> 03:17:20.128
TO IS THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT

03:17:20.195 --> 03:17:21.930
THERE'S NOT A DEARTH OF

03:17:21.996 --> 03:17:25.833
INFORMATION ABOUT DATA THEFT

03:17:25.900 --> 03:17:28.336
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT AND

03:17:28.403 --> 03:17:30.471
I CAN JUST SCRATCH MY HEAD ON ON

03:17:30.538 --> 03:17:33.074
ON THAT- PERHAPS SOME OF OUR

03:17:33.141 --> 03:17:36.010
&lt;c.green&gt;IGGEST COMPETITORS- JUST SIMPLY&lt;/c&gt;

03:17:36.077 --> 03:17:38.713
REPLICATE- THROUGH PUBLIC DOMAIN

03:17:38.780 --> 03:17:42.917
SOURCES IN MANUFACTURE COMPETING

03:17:42.984 --> 03:17:47.789

03:17:47.855 --> 03:17:50.024
AT ANY CALL FOR THAT. FURTHER

03:17:50.091 --> 03:17:51.593
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT RIVERS

03:17:51.659 --> 03:17:53.561
ENGINEER HAPPENS EVERYWHERE IN

03:17:53.628 --> 03:17:56.331
THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES IT TAKES

03:17:56.397 --> 03:17:58.700
TO PINPOINT WHERE THAT OCCURRED

03:17:58.766 --> 03:18:00.301
MIGHT PARTIALLY EXPLAIN WHY

03:18:00.368 --> 03:18:02.036
THERE MAY NOT BE A DEARTH BUT WE

03:18:02.103 --> 03:18:04.772

OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- WHAT I DO

03:39:59.853 --> 03:40:01.721
THINK WE NEED TO AT LEAST THAT

03:40:01.788 --> 03:40:04.357
AT SOME POINT- CONSIDER AND I

03:40:04.424 --> 03:40:06.626

BUT- AT. THE ABBOTT DOING WORK

03:40:09.930 --> 03:40:13.567
IN THIS AREA- ONE OF THE ISSUES

03:40:13.633 --> 03:40:16.002
THAT- THAT I'M SENSITIVE TO IS

03:40:16.069 --> 03:40:18.138
THAT WHEN THERE IS A DOMESTIC

03:40:18.204 --> 03:40:20.907
SITUATION IN AN APARTMENT- IT

03:40:20.974 --> 03:40:22.709
DOESN'T AFFECT JUST THE FAMILY

03:40:22.776 --> 03:40:24.277
THAT'S EXPERIENCING THE DOMESTIC

03:40:24.344 --> 03:40:26.179
VIOLENCE IT'S THE NEIGHBORS AND-

03:40:26.246 --> 03:40:28.782
AND FRANKLY WHEN YOU. YOU CALL

03:40:28.848 --> 03:40:30.850
TO HAVE SOMEONE ARRESTED IT'S

03:40:30.917 --> 03:40:32.552
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE

03:40:32.619 --> 03:40:35.322
IT'S USUALLY AT NIGHT. AND THERE

03:40:35.388 --> 03:40:37.123
ARE FLASHING LIGHTS AND THERE'S

03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:41.127
POLICE OFFICERS AND BECAUSE

03:40:41.194 --> 03:40:41.761
THEY'RE SO VOLATILE THERE IT'S

03:40:41.828 --> 03:40:44.664
DANGEROUS MANY OF THE SITUATION

03:40:44.731 --> 03:40:46.900
. DEALING IN SCREAMING AND

03:40:46.967 --> 03:40:53.206
USUALLY- THE BEST. SIX DEAD- I'M

03:40:53.273 --> 03:40:54.140
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO WE

03:40:54.207 --> 03:40:55.909
WANT TO SURE THEM AS WELL SO

03:40:55.976 --> 03:40:57.310
SOMEONE IS REALLY CREATING A

03:40:57.377 --> 03:40:58.612
NUISANCE FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE

03:40:58.678 --> 03:41:03.049
THEY'RE SHOWING UP WITHOUT THE-

03:41:03.116 --> 03:41:07.220
THERE AUTHOR IS A- AT. THE OR

03:41:07.287 --> 03:41:08.121
WITH AUTHORIZATION OF THE

03:41:08.188 --> 03:41:10.490
VICTIMS- IT KIND OF ENDED

03:41:10.557 --> 03:41:13.226
FINANCES OF- PROTECTIVE ORDERS

03:41:13.293 --> 03:41:15.161
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME SOME WAY

03:41:15.228 --> 03:41:15.996
TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE

03:41:16.062 --> 03:41:18.064
NEIGHBORHOOD SO I SAY THAT

03:41:18.131 --> 03:41:19.799
BECAUSE THAT THE SAME THING

03:41:19.866 --> 03:41:21.701
OCCURS WHEN YOU'RE SKATING

03:41:21.768 --> 03:41:24.404
VIOLENCE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:41:24.471 --> 03:41:24.971
THAT THE FAMILY DOESN'T GET

03:41:25.038 --> 03:41:27.707
EVICTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE A- K.

03:41:27.774 --> 03:41:29.042
WHO'S OUT OF CONTROL RIGHT. BUT

03:41:29.109 --> 03:41:31.044
BY THE SAME TOKEN IT AFFECTS THE

03:41:31.111 --> 03:41:32.345
ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD SO I JUST

03:41:32.412 --> 03:41:33.880
WANT TO SAY THAT I'M GONNA

03:41:33.947 --> 03:41:36.216
SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK

03:41:36.282 --> 03:41:37.017
IT'S A GOOD BET. BUT I DO THINK

03:41:37.083 --> 03:41:39.386
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT- IF

03:41:39.452 --> 03:41:42.155
THERE'S SOME KIND OF AVOID IT.

03:41:42.222 --> 03:41:43.690
TO ALLOW THE LANDLORD TO DO

03:41:43.757 --> 03:41:45.058
SOMETHING THAT THEN PROTECTS THE

03:41:45.125 --> 03:41:46.359
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE NEIGHBORS

03:41:46.426 --> 03:41:48.194
THE CHAIR AND I HAD DISCUSSIONS

03:41:48.261 --> 03:41:49.329
ABOUT THAT AS WELL THAT'S I MEAN

03:41:49.396 --> 03:41:50.864
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK AND

03:41:50.930 --> 03:41:51.898
WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE REALLY

03:41:51.965 --> 03:41:53.633
TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT WHICH IS

03:41:53.700 --> 03:41:54.768
WHAT THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION

03:41:54.834 --> 03:41:58.471
HAS. ON MORE TROLL WHO. AND

03:41:58.538 --> 03:42:00.173

OF HARD TO THE PROCESS SOMETIME

03:42:02.542 --> 03:42:03.176

03:42:03.243 --> 03:42:04.344

03:42:04.411 --> 03:42:06.246

03:42:06.312 --> 03:42:08.048

FOR EXAMPLE THE ROSENTHAL ACT

05:01:59.201 --> 05:02:01.670
WOULD PROHIBIT LANDLORDS. WE

05:02:01.736 --> 05:02:04.906

05:02:24.893 --> 05:02:27.963
AND UNTIL. BUT TENS OF JUDGING.

05:02:28.029 --> 05:02:30.332
AGAINST THAT THAT TENANTS. THIS

05:02:30.398 --> 05:02:32.367
WOULD HARM THE GUARANTOR PARENTS

05:02:32.434 --> 05:02:35.837
AND THE TENANTS ALIKE AND SIMPLY

05:02:35.904 --> 05:02:38.340
DOES NOT ALIGN WITH THE PURPORT

05:02:38.406 --> 05:02:39.608
. THE BILL. ANOTHER EXAMPLE

05:02:39.674 --> 05:02:41.943

THE RENTAL CONTEXT ALANLAR WOULD

05:02:56.992 --> 05:02:58.727

06:35:09.886 --> 06:35:11.754
RISKS TO THE FUN AND THE

06:35:11.821 --> 06:35:14.424
DIVERSIFICATION IS A- THROUGH

06:35:14.490 --> 06:35:15.825
THE CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR WHAT

06:35:15.892 --> 06:35:18.294
KOWSKI I THINK- THAT IS A GOOD

06:35:18.361 --> 06:35:19.062
QUESTION I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW

06:35:19.128 --> 06:35:21.697
WHAT THAT TRUE- REASON FOR

06:35:21.764 --> 06:35:23.666
OPPOSING A BILL LIKE THIS. GIVEN

06:35:23.733 --> 06:35:25.501
THE FACT THAT THIS IS ONE TOOL

06:35:25.568 --> 06:35:27.136
IN ADDITION TO ENGAGEMENT THAT

06:35:27.203 --> 06:35:30.907
COULD BE USED- TO PROVIDE MORE

06:35:30.973 --> 06:35:33.342
RETURNS- FOR. PARTICIPANTS IN

06:35:33.409 --> 06:35:34.911
FACT THE CALPERS HAS A

06:35:34.977 --> 06:35:37.980
DIVESTMENT REVIEW PRESENTATION I

06:35:38.047 --> 06:35:39.082
BELIEVE THAT WAS DONE NOT TOO

06:35:39.148 --> 06:35:41.451
LONG AGO I THINK BETTER ABOUT A

06:35:41.517 --> 06:35:42.852
YEAR AGO. ON PAGE SIX OF THAT

06:35:42.919 --> 06:35:45.588
EVEN STATES BASED ON THE FIVE OR

06:35:45.655 --> 06:35:47.790
SIX DIVESTMENT POLICIES THAT

06:35:47.857 --> 06:35:48.891
HAVE BEEN DONE HAVE BEEN DONE BY

06:35:48.958 --> 06:35:50.560
THE BOARD LED LED BY CALPERS

06:35:50.626 --> 06:35:52.728
STIRS BOARDS AND THE OTHER HALF

06:35:52.795 --> 06:35:56.866
BY THE LEGISLATURE- THE- I QUOTE

06:35:56.933 --> 06:35:59.902
CAL. ST HOW DAVIS. MANAGES FUND

06:35:59.969 --> 06:36:01.637
THE ANY FEASIBLE INVESTMENT

06:36:01.704 --> 06:36:02.972
ALTERNATIVES WOULD YIELD A LOWER

06:36:03.039 --> 06:36:04.607
RATE OF RETURN WITH COMMENSURATE

06:36:04.674 --> 06:36:08.010
DEGREES OF RISK FOR CREATE A

06:36:08.077 --> 06:36:09.679
HIGHER DEGREE. OF RISK WITH

06:36:09.745 --> 06:36:11.981
COMMENSURATE. RATES OF RETURN.

06:36:12.048 --> 06:36:13.149
AND THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT

06:36:13.216 --> 06:36:15.318
WITH THEM. WAS A GUY'S NAME

06:36:15.384 --> 06:36:16.752
SEPARATELY THE FIRST THE FIRST

06:36:16.819 --> 06:36:21.023
WITNESS CENTER AT SAM'S TO YOLO

06:36:21.090 --> 06:36:22.458
WITH USED TO THE FINANCIAL

06:36:22.525 --> 06:36:24.060
ANALYSIS HE AT LEAST IT

06:36:24.127 --> 06:36:25.695
INDICATES THAT THAT NEW YORK

06:36:25.761 --> 06:36:27.997
CITY COULD MEET ITS FINANCIAL

06:36:28.064 --> 06:36:33.136
TARGETS BY DIVESTING- AND I JUST

06:36:33.202 --> 06:36:36.939
I DON'T KNOW. IT APPEARS THE

06:36:37.006 --> 06:36:39.275
PORTFOLIO THEY CALPERS HAS IS

06:36:39.342 --> 06:36:43.179
ABOUT 1% OF FOSSIL FUELS GIVE OR

06:36:43.246 --> 06:36:44.680
TAKE WHATEVER YOU KNOW WHATEVER

06:36:44.747 --> 06:36:47.316
THEY DO ON A DIFFERENT DAY I'D I

06:36:47.383 --> 06:36:51.020
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PORTFOLIO OF

06:36:51.087 --> 06:36:53.723
. THE NEW YORK CITY WAS- AND THE

06:36:53.789 --> 06:36:54.991
REASON I ASK IS THAT IS THAT

06:36:55.057 --> 06:36:56.926
THERE IS SOME RISK WHEN YOU DO

06:36:56.993 --> 06:36:58.227
SOME OF THE BEST DIVESTITURE

06:36:58.294 --> 06:36:59.929
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER

06:36:59.996 --> 06:37:02.431
GOOGLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IT'S

06:37:02.498 --> 06:37:08.871
MAKING MONEY RIGHT- OKAY BUT.

06:37:08.938 --> 06:37:11.073
I'D SAY THE GUY FIFTH WHETHER WE

06:37:11.140 --> 06:37:12.408
HAVE THE AUTHORITY THE WISDOM OF

06:37:12.475 --> 06:37:14.911
IT I GUESS IS THE THIS IS THE

06:37:14.977 --> 06:37:18.414
QUESTION- I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT

06:37:18.481 --> 06:37:21.150
HOW HOW WE GET THERE. ALL RIGHT

06:37:21.217 --> 06:37:24.587

06:37:28.357 --> 06:37:31.027
LEADING ON IT I KNOW IT HAS BEEN

06:37:31.093 --> 06:37:34.897
EASY. IN A LOT OF- BLOWBACK- I'M

06:37:34.964 --> 06:37:36.866
PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR OF

OF CALPERS- TO BE A- FIDUCIARY-

06:37:50.546 --> 06:37:52.748
I JUST DON'T SEE FOSSIL FUEL

06:37:52.815 --> 06:37:57.186
DIVESTMENT. ANYWAY HARMING- THE-

06:37:57.253 --> 06:37:59.956
THE PENSION FUND I JUST DON'T I

06:38:00.022 --> 06:38:01.958
JUST DON'T SEE IT IT'S A IT'S A

06:38:02.024 --> 06:38:05.962
SMALL PERCENTAGE. IT'S ONE.

06:38:06.028 --> 06:38:08.698
INDUSTRY AMONG SO MANY- IT IS

06:38:08.764 --> 06:38:10.233
WE'RE NOT ASKING THIRD BEST FROM

06:38:10.299 --> 06:38:13.669
LIKE FORTY PERCENT. OF THE FUNDS

06:38:13.736 --> 06:38:17.206
THIS IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE- AND

06:38:17.273 --> 06:38:19.909
THIS IS HONESTLY AN INDUSTRY

06:38:19.976 --> 06:38:22.078
THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE INVESTING

06:38:22.144 --> 06:38:25.047
AND WE SHOULD NOT BE A PARTY TO

06:38:25.114 --> 06:38:27.216
PROVIDING CAPITAL. TO AN

06:38:27.283 --> 06:38:29.986
INDUSTRY THAT IS LITERALLY

06:38:30.052 --> 06:38:33.823
BURNING AND FLOODING THE PLANET

06:38:33.889 --> 06:38:35.958
THAT'S MAKING PEOPLE SICK. THAT

06:38:36.025 --> 06:38:38.561
IS DESTROYING PEOPLE'S HOMES.

06:38:38.628 --> 06:38:41.998
THAT IS FLOODING ROADS AND

06:38:42.064 --> 06:38:45.901
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS- AND IT

06:38:45.968 --> 06:38:48.304
SAYS WE SHOULDN'T BE A PARTY- SO

06:38:48.371 --> 06:38:50.439
THAT AND SO I THINK THIS MAKES

06:38:50.506 --> 06:38:52.475

THAT. I BELIEVE THE RETIREMENT

06:41:04.407 --> 06:41:07.510
SYSTEM- ALLEN'S ON YOU KNOW WHAT

SPEAK FOR THE RETIREMENT PLAN

06:41:33.369 --> 06:41:35.070
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE

06:41:35.137 --> 06:41:35.971
REPORT THEY DO ASSESS THIS

06:41:36.038 --> 06:41:38.274

06:41:38.340 --> 06:41:39.608
NINETEEN AND THEY HAVE TO UPDATE

06:41:39.675 --> 06:41:40.843
EVERY THREE YEARS THEY DO TALK

06:41:40.910 --> 06:41:42.278
ABOUT THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH THE

06:41:42.344 --> 06:41:43.712
PARIS ACCORD AND OTHER PROPOSALS

06:41:43.779 --> 06:41:46.715

WHICH IS JUST A PLEDGE. AT THIS

06:41:55.024 --> 06:41:56.926
TIME- KNOWING THAT IT DOESN'T

06:41:56.992 --> 06:41:58.994
ALIGN WITH CALIFORNIA GOALS. AND

06:41:59.061 --> 06:42:01.163

TYPE IN ANY OF THE TWO HUNDRED

06:42:08.637 --> 06:42:09.905
LISTS THAT WE- CHEVRON. CLEARLY

06:42:09.972 --> 06:42:11.774
THEY'RE NOT MEETING THEIR- GOALS

06:42:11.841 --> 06:42:14.543
BY EVEN TWENTY FIFTY. IN TERM

06:42:14.610 --> 06:42:15.711
GOALS NOT EVEN HITTING THAT SO I

06:42:15.778 --> 06:42:17.646
DON'T KNOW HOW WE- OUR OWN GOALS

06:42:17.713 --> 06:42:19.849
AS A AS A PORTFOLIO OF NINE

06:42:19.915 --> 06:42:21.116
BILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN THE TWO

06:42:21.183 --> 06:42:24.019

06:42:35.831 --> 06:42:38.567
SITUATION OF WAR WHEN PRICES GO

06:42:38.634 --> 06:42:40.769
DOWN AND WHEN WE HAVE

06:42:40.836 --> 06:42:42.538
POTENTIALLY STRANDED ASSETS

06:51:08.977 --> 06:51:10.912
I AM PERSUADED TO SOME EXTENT

06:51:10.979 --> 06:51:12.948
ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THAT OKAY

06:51:13.015 --> 06:51:14.349
WELL IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

06:51:14.416 --> 06:51:16.051
THESE ENTITIES THAT ARE GOING TO

06:51:16.118 --> 06:51:17.119
POLLUTE THE EARTH IT DOESN'T

06:51:17.185 --> 06:51:19.488
MATTER. WE DRAW THESE RIDICULOUS

06:51:19.554 --> 06:51:21.089
LINES IN THE AIR THAT WE CALL

06:51:21.156 --> 06:51:22.557
STATES AND CITIES AND COUNTIES

06:51:22.624 --> 06:51:24.526
WE ARE ONE GIGANTIC GLOBE. THE

06:51:24.593 --> 06:51:25.994
STUFF IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS

06:51:26.061 --> 06:51:27.929
IN THE HARBOR IS KILLING US THAT

06:51:27.996 --> 06:51:29.464
POLLUTANTS IN THE HARBOR THAT

06:51:29.531 --> 06:51:31.033
STUFF'S COMING FROM OTHER PARTS

06:51:31.099 --> 06:51:33.802
OF THE WORLD. SO IT BECOMES AYE

06:51:33.869 --> 06:51:35.704
AYE ALL OVER SAY IS THIS BECAUSE

06:51:35.771 --> 06:51:37.372
I WANT TO ADDRESS THE LARGER

06:51:37.439 --> 06:51:39.541
ISSUE. APOLOGIZE I'M TAKING MR

LAYERED SPEECH BECAUSE I WORK ON

06:51:40.876 --> 06:51:42.944
LABOR. BUT BECAUSE IT'S

06:51:43.011 --> 06:51:44.746
IMPORTANT TO CONTEXTUALIZE THIS

06:51:44.813 --> 06:51:48.250
THING UP BECAUSE THE FOLKS THAT

06:51:48.316 --> 06:51:50.152
ARE IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE THE

06:51:50.218 --> 06:51:51.219
PROJECT INTO THIS. ARE

06:51:51.286 --> 06:51:52.554
PROJECTING BECAUSE TO THE POINT

06:51:52.621 --> 06:51:54.723
THAT SENATOR ALSO MADE. I CAN

06:51:54.790 --> 06:51:57.759

06:51:57.826 --> 06:51:58.960
WORK HAPPENING GUEST STARS

06:51:59.027 --> 06:52:02.664
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO WHAT WHAT'S

06:52:02.731 --> 06:52:04.733
THE TERM. THAT WE USE- THE-

06:52:04.800 --> 06:52:06.835
INTERESTS. CHARM WHAT DO NOT TO.

06:52:06.902 --> 06:52:09.371
ARE GIVEN REAL AND WE'RE FIGURE

06:52:09.438 --> 06:52:10.038
OUT. HOW TO CREATE AND- APPROACH

06:52:10.105 --> 06:52:12.140
TO THIS LOOK. I'M OF A LARGE

06:52:12.207 --> 06:52:13.175
BIRD ON THIS BECAUSE- THE TEST

06:52:13.241 --> 06:52:16.511
IS. ARE WE REDUCING GHGS

06:52:16.578 --> 06:52:19.147
ENVIRONMENT I USED TO TELL THE

06:52:19.214 --> 06:52:20.849
ENVIRONMENT WAS TO SIT BACK AND

06:52:20.916 --> 06:52:21.917
TALK ABOUT THIS ALL DAY LONG.

06:52:21.983 --> 06:52:23.118
ALL THE REGULATIONS HOW MANY

06:52:23.185 --> 06:52:24.653
POUNDS OF CARBON YOU REDUCE THE

06:52:24.719 --> 06:52:26.088
ENVIRONMENT I TOOK OFF TWELVE

06:52:26.154 --> 06:52:27.856
YEARS OF MY LIFE. AND I TRAVEL

06:52:27.923 --> 06:52:29.057
THE WORLD TO REDUCE CARBON IN

06:52:29.124 --> 06:52:31.093
THE WORLD RIGHT. DOES THIS IN

06:52:31.159 --> 06:52:32.661
FACT DO THAT OR DOES IT JUST

06:52:32.727 --> 06:52:34.062
MAKE A STATEMENT THAT'S THE

06:52:34.129 --> 06:52:35.664
QUESTION SO LOOK AT YOUR THOUGHT

06:52:35.730 --> 06:52:37.265
ABOUT THIS A LOT I'M GONNA VOTE

06:52:37.332 --> 06:52:38.934

06:52:39.000 --> 06:52:40.135
IT'S THE RIGHT. TO GIVE YOU A

06:52:40.202 --> 06:52:42.137
CHANCE TO KEEP. GO IT'S GOT

06:52:48.844 --> 06:52:50.245
STUFF. IS STILL NEEDS SOME

06:52:50.312 --> 06:52:52.180
HOMEWORK I THINK IS I THINK THAT

06:52:52.247 --> 06:52:53.915
THE CHAIR. AT THE DATES BUT- I

06:52:53.982 --> 06:52:54.983
DO THINK WE CAN ANALYZE THIS

06:52:55.050 --> 06:52:57.719
LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT I THINK

06:52:57.786 --> 06:52:59.387
YOUR EARNEST. AND YOUR CARD. YOU
