OF THE FIRST OF THREE PAGES OF THE HAND OUT PROVIDE JUST KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION. OF THE KEY TYPES OF VERNON LEARN OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE AND THE STATE AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS- THAT CARRY OUT. THOSE LEARN OPPORTUNITIES. AND THIS THIS CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT FOR THINKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT- FUNDING BUCKETS WHAT'S ALL WHICH I WILL SUMMARIZE- IN IN A FEW MINUTES- BUT BUT FIRST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND AGENCIES- THAT OUR SUPPLIER. I LEVEL- THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ART AND LEARNED A LOT YOU KNOW WHAT PROGRAMS IN THE STATE ANYTHING FROM APPRENTICESHIPS AND PRE APPRENTICESHIPS- WHICH- PROVIDE SHORTER TERM TRAINING TO HELP- WRITTEN REDUCED- TECHNICAL BARRIERS- BUT PREPARE. FOLKS THAT MIGHT HAVE OF BARRIERS TO ENTERING A APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM- WE ALSO HAVE ENCUMBER WORKER TRAINING PROGRAMS WHICH ARE- TYPICALLY EMPLOYER SPONSORED PROGRAMS- THAT THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR CRRENT WORKERS- TO HELP THEM LEARN A MERGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR TO PROMOTE INTO MORE ADVANCED POSITIONS. WITHIN THE COMPANY AS THE STATE ALSO SUPPORTS A- SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS- WHICH- ARE THOSE WHERE A THIRD PARTY TYPICALLY A GOVERNMENT AGENCY IS PROVIDING. US SOME SOME FUNDING TO COVER WAGE COSTS FOR CERTAIN WORKERS TO ENCOURAGE. EMPLOYERS TO HIRE AND RETRAIN OTHERS WORKERS. IN TERMS OF STUDENTS THE STATE ALSO SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF PAID INTERNSHIP AND PAID PROJECT BASED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES- SO THAT'S KIND OF THE- THE GENERAL LANDSCAPE OF THE KIND OF THE TYPES OF EARN AND LEARN PROGRAMMES- IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE KEY PLAYERS IN TERMS OF AGENCIES THAT ARE ADMINISTERING THESE. THERE'S A FEW KEY CATEGORIES- THE FIRST IS THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES- WOULD START WITH THE DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS- WHICH AS MENTIONED IS WITHIN THE PARMA DUST RELATIONS AND THEY CERTIFY AND OVERSEE. ALL OF THE OPPRESSOR PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL. WHICH PROVIDES GRANTS TO EMPLOYERS- TO FIND SHORT TERM INCUMBENT WORKER TRAINING IN THIS IS TYPICALLY A FINANCED THROUGH A STATEWIDE EMPLOYEE PAID PAYROLL TAX. FINALLY HAVE THE ALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD WHICH SETS US STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY ACT AND FUNDING. THE SECOND KEY CATEGORY ARE THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE'S VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE STARTING WITH THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE ON THIS PROGRAM SUPPORTS NEW APPRENTICESHIP AND PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED. HIGH DEMAND SUCH AS HEALTH CARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO THAT HAVE NOT- TRADITIONALLY USED IN APPRENTICESHIP MODEL. ON THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS AND IS ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUNITY OTHER CALIFORNIA MANY CALLS CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COLLEGES AND IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT- CURRICULUM IN START UP COSTS FOR PENSION PROGRAMS. ARE ALSO UNDER THE KIND OF EDUCATIONAL UMBRELLA WE HAVE- THE RELATED AND SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION PROGRAM WHICH REIMBURSES APPRENTICESHIP SPONSORS FOR PORTION OF THEIR INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND- IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE REIMBURSEMENTS THEY MUST A PARTNER WITH A SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN CARRYING OUT THEIR PRECIOUS. FINALLY OF THE- THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM WHICH WAS CREATED TO IMPROVE- THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND USE FUNDS ARE INTENDED SUPPORT THINGS LIKE SMALLER TRAINING CLASS SIZES- QUITMAN COSTS. AND REGIONAL PLANNING COORDINATION- AND RECENT- A RECENT FUNDING IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET- EXPAND THIS TO INCLUDE- WORK BASED LEARNING- PURPOSES LIKE AN INTERNSHIP. ALL THE FINAL BUCKET OR OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH A HEALTHY HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES IN PARTICULAR- THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES A CASH GRANTS TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF ADULTS. WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CHARACTERS THAT THEY EITHER BE WORKING OR PARTICIPATE IN WORK TRAINING. A KEY ELEMENT OF A COW OR CAL WORKS WORK TRAINING IS A SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. THROUGH WHICH THE STATE PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO PROVIDE. COVER A PORTION OF WAGE COSTS FOR EMPLOYERS WHO HIRE CAL WORKS. RECIPIENTS SO KIND OF WITH HAVING LAID OUT THAT THE LANDSCAPE OF ALL THESE VARIOUS- PIECES OF THE- AND LEARN PUZZLE ON PAGE FOUR- WE OUTLINED THAT THE FUNDING TO THESE OF VARIOUS. COMPONENTS. I WON'T YOU KNOW WALK LINE BY LINE HERE THROUGH THE FUNDING FOR EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IT'S SUMMARIZED. IN THE TABLE IN PAGE FOR THE HAS THE LINE ITEM APPROPRIATION N EACH OF THESE AREAS AND THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. BUDGET JUST A COUPLE OF KIND OF HIGHER LEVEL OBSERVATION YOU'LL NOTICE HERE- THAT THE FUNDING IS. ALLOCATED ACROSS A VARIETY OF BUDGET LINE ITEMS ENTITIES AND IS TARGETED AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- IN TOTAL THE FUNDING. IS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THIS IS A NOTABLE INCREASE FOR THIS- THE SELECTION OF PROGRAMS OVER THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET MORE THAN INCREASE MORE THAN A THIRD OVER THE FUNDING LEVEL. I THAT WAS PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY- SO WITH THAT I'LL GO TO CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION- AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANKS BROWN IF YOU DON'T MIND- WE HAVE- ERIC GREITENS COME UP. FROM THE CHIEF A CHIEF OF THE VENTURE PARTNERSHIP STANDARDS THANK YOU FOR APPEARING TODAY DISCUSS% INTERNAL LEARN ALSO REFERRED TO AS PRESSURE PROGRAMS. OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE IN THE EMPIRE AND THE DIVISION IS DOING TO INCREASE THESE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE REGION. JACK CAN YOU GO AHEAD AND ADJUST STAYS WELL TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER A- ERIC VENTURES THANK YOU. THANKS FOR WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU WELL GOOD- COMMITTEE CHAIR AND THE STEAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS ERIC REID I AM THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF OPPRESSIVE STANDARDS. I'M HONORED TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIPS. HOW CAN BE A SOLUTION TO CALIFORNIA'S LOOMING CRISIS TO RESOLVE THE GROWING NEED IN THE ALLIED HEALTH WORKFORCE. AND HOW IT CAN ADDRESS THE WORKFORCE NEEDS FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EMPLOYERS. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS OUR COLLABORATION OF MANY PARTNERS. MY TEAM AT THE DIVISION OF PRINCIP STANDARDS HELP THESE PARTNERS DEVELOPED A FRAMEWORK FOR REGIONAL. IN INDUSTRY APPRENTICESHIP SPONSORS. OUR PARTNERS INCLUDE EMPLOYERS IN THERE- ASSOCIATIONS LABOR UNIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFITS AND LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WHICH INCLUDE. COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION'S LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. APPRENTICESHIPS ARE JOBS APPRENTICESHIP APPRENTICES RECEIVE AROUND A HUNDRED FORTY FOUR HOURS A YEAR IN CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION. WHETHER IN PERSON OR NOWADAYS A LOT OF ONLINE- CLASSES AS WELL LEARN LEARNING A SPECIFIC JOB CORPS FUNCTION IN APPLYING THOSE LESSONS LEARNED ON THE JOB. APPRENTICES YOU REQUIRE AT LEAST ONE WAGE PROGRESSION OR REYES AS A PRINCIPAL LEARN NEW SKILLS DURING THE DURATION OF THE APPRENTICESHIP. FRIENDSHIPS CAN LAST ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE JOB. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS PROVIDE FOR DIVERSITY MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS EMPHASIZE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR JUSTICE IMPACTED VETERANS. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. TO EARN A WAGE WHILE GETTING AN EDUCATION. THIS MAKES APPRENTICESHIP IN ATTRACTIVE MODEL FOR SOCIALLY MINDED INDUSTRY PARTERS IN MEETING ACT THEIR EQUITY GOALS. CALIFORNIA DEPENDS ON A VAST WELL TRAINED WORKFORCE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE TO THE STATE'S DIVERSE POPULATION. ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHICH INCLUDE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE DENTAL ASSISTANCE IMAGING SPECIALISTS IN OTHER NON NURSING PROFESSIONS MAKE UP 60% OF THE SPECIALISTS AND OTHER NON NURSING PROFESSIONS- IN THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. IN ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND SHORT SUPPLY. CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SUGGESTED THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND ALLIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ANNUALLY RESULTING IN A DEMAND OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW WORKERS BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THIS NEED IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHICH TRANSLATES TO AROUND SEVENTY THOUSAND NEW WORKERS BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. TO MEET THIS NEED CALIFORNIA MUST FIRST ASSESS THE CURRENT SUPPLY OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS PROFESSIONALS. IN THE REMOVE KEY BARRIERS TO INCREASE IN ANY SUPPLY SHORTAGE. ACCORDING TO A RECENT CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION REPORT THERE WILL BE NEARLY. A HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX THOUSAND UNFILLED JOBS OVER THE EIGHT YEAR PERIOD IN THE TEN HIGHEST DEMAND ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THAT WOULD BE THE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. ONE WAY OF ADDRESSING THIS NEED TO TRAIN LOWER LEVEL INCUMBENT WORKERS IN HEALTH FACILITIES TO CLIMB A CAREER LADDER WITHIN THEIR INSTITUTIONS TO BE BETTER PAID. MORE SKILLED JOBS. OTHER BOYS TO EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST JOB GROSS SUPPORT IN TECHNICIAN POSITION IN ALLIED HEALTH ESPECIALLY THOSE PROVIDING LONG TERM CARE FACE CONSIDERABLE. JOB QUALITY CHALLENGES. ACCESS TO A QUALITY JOB HEAVILY STRATIFIED BY RACE GENDER GEOGRAPHY. AND LEVEL OF EDUCATION ATTAINMENT IN TRAINING. BLACK THAT NEXT IN NEED OF AMERICAN HEALTH WORKERS INCLUDING WORKERS FROM SPECIFIC ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER ETHNIC GROUPS IN IMMIGRANT BACKGROUNDS TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS WITH LOWER BERRIES BARRIERS TO ENTRY BUT WITH LOWER WAGES AND STRESSFUL WORKING CONDITIONS. THESE POSITIONS SUCH AS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND HOME HEALTH AIDES ARE OFTEN PART TIME EARLY OR TEMPORARY POSITIONS WITH LIMITED BENEFITS AND LIMITED CAREER ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OVERALL POSITIONS THAT INVOLVE FEEDING MOVING CLEANING AND CARING FOR PATIENTS ARE GENERALLY PART TIME AND OFFER FEWER BENEFITS. WORKERS IN THIS SECTORWHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN OF COLOR ON AVERAGE EARN A LITTLE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ENOUGH TO WORK TWO OR THREE JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET. GIVEN THESE UNATTRACTIVE CONDITIONS EMPLOYERS FACE AN UP HILL BATTLE IN RECRUITING. AND RETAINING WORKERS FOR THE FASTEST GROWING POSITIONS. WELL THE DEMAND AND JOB AVAILABILITY ARE HIGH THESE OCCUPATIONS EXPERIENCE THE TORIES FLEA HIGH TURNOVER RATES WHICH CAN LEAD TO POOR QUALITY AND FRAGMENTED PATIENT CARE INCREASING COST TO THE EMPLOYER. THE RATE IN WHICH LONG TERM CARE WORKERS SUCH AS PERSONAL CARE OR HOME HEALTH AIDES MEDICAL SYSTEMS. OR LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES LEAVE THE PROFESSION FOR OTHER EMPLOYMENT FAR OUTPACES THE RATE OF ENTRY INTO THESE JOBS. AND THOSE WHO DO LEAVE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE UNEMPLOYED REPORT HIGHER RATES OF DISABILITY EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY. ONE WAY OF ADDRESSING THIS NEED IS CREATING THROUGH APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WILL SUPPORT LOWER LEVEL WORKERS EARNING A SALARY IN THEIR CURRENT POSITIONS. WELL TRAINING FOR HIGHER LEVEL POSITIONS SUCHAS A THERAPIST OR TECH POSITIONS. DIVISIONER PRECIOUS STANDARDS HAS SUPPORTED A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WITH THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION ONE THOUSAND THAT TOOK. LICENSE LOCATIONAL NURSES WORKING IN FACILITIES. SUPPORTED THROUGH A TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM WHERE THE EMPLOYER REQUIRED TWENTY HOURS OF WORK. AND PROVIDED TWENTY HOURS OF PAID TIME OFF FOR ENROLLMENT IN THE LPN TO RN PROGRAM. THIS ALLOWED LPNS TO CONTINUE EARNING THEIR SALARY WELL IN ROLLED IN THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS. A WE HAVE SINCE STARTED THE PROGRAM IN. SACRAMENTO AREA AND WE ARE NOW DOING THAT PROGRAM NOW IN RIVERSIDE S. AS WELL. AT THE DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARD I'M SORRY ABOUT 92% OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS LPN TO RN PROGRAM OR MINORITIES OR RECENT IMMIGRANTS. OVER 50% WERE SINGLE MOTHERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO RETURN TO SCHOOL FOR AN RN DEGREE. SIX US WILL GRADUATES 90% OF THOSE ENTERING THE PROGRAM WERE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR WAGES FROM FORTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. WITH A COMMITMENT FOR TWO YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT AT THE INSTITUTION FOLLOWING THEIR GRADUATION. THE DIVISION OF OPPRESSIVE STANDARDS IS NOW LOOKING TO SUPPORT DNTAL ASSISTANT PROGRAMS. IN OTHER AREAS IN ALLIED HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH EASY PRE APPRENTICESHIPS. AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. AT THE DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS WE'RE WORKING TO ACHIEVE THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND APPRENTICESHIPS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. AND HEALTH CARE PARTNERSHIPS ARE PRIORITY. THE GOVERNOR HAS ADDED- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL WHICH WAS DISCUSSED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT NOW IN AN APPRENTICESHIP. THE DIVISION- PRECIOUS STANDARDS INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON A FRENCH SUPPORTED ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE SEVENTY THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ THAT STRENGTHENS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. WITHIN THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BY ADDING NEW MEMBERS TO THE COMMITTEE. AND MAKING A PRESSURE PROGRAMS MORE SENSIBLE TO LOW INCOME EMPLOYEES. THIS BILL FOLLOWS EARLIER LEGISLATION THAT ESTABLISHED THE INTERAGENCY ADVISER CAN COMMITTEE ON APPRENTICESHIP ASSEMBLY BILL TWO THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IT IMPLIED MET SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE OH FIVE ALSO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ- TASK FORCE REPORT ON BARRIERS. AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO FACILITATE AND EARN AND LEARN TRAINING PROGRAMS IN ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS THAT WAS RELEASED IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY. ONE OF THE FINDINGS WAS THAT THE INTERAGENCY ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON OPPRESSION APPRENTICESHIP WAS NOT STRUCTURE TO ALLOW FOR THAN NECESSARY COLLABORATION BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES. PARTICULARLY IN THE HEALTH FIELD SO THAT CROSS GOVERNMENT COLLABORATION COULD BE REALIZED. IT WAS FOUND THAT SOME OF LICENSURE PROGRAMS LIKE RESPIRATORY THERAPY AND RADIOLOGIC SHE- TECHNOLOGY DO NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO WORK WELL IN SCHOOL THAT'S MAKING THEM INELIGIBLE FOR STATE APPRENTICESHIP REGISTRATION. AND THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. WE ARE HOPING THAT THE REQUIREMENTS AND ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE SEVENTY THREE WILL REMOVE ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS TO SUCCESS. SUCH AS REQUIREMENT BY A PRIVATE ACCREDITING GROUPS THAT DISALLOW FRIENDSHIP PROGRAMS AND HEALTH CARE. THROUGH REMOVAL OF THESE BARRIERS AND NEW FUNDING AVAILABILITY WE CAN CREATE A MORE DIVERSE ECONOMIC UPWARD MOBILE WORKFORCE NOW LIKE HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU WITH THAT- VERY VERY INFORMATIVE I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE. A COUPLE AS WELL WE TALKED ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE PRESSURE PROGRAMS NOT THE STATE- WOULD ANYBODY BRIAN OR YOU ERIC KNOW HOW MANY WE'VE DONE IN THE WHOLE STATE AND HOW MANY OF THOSE. ARE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND WE TALK ABOUT THE SCHOOL RIVERSIDE BUT- DO WE KNOW PARTICULAR IN THE INLAND EMPIRE HOW MANY OF THOSE- PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE ARE STUDENTS IN THE PRESSURE PROGRAM. YEAH WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD IN THE LAST. THREE YEARS TO REALLY FOCUS ON NOT WHAT WE WERE CUT NONTRADITIONAL REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIPS THESE ARE FOR PROJECTS OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. IN FIREFIGHTING WHICH IT WHICH MAKES UP ABOUT 90% OF ALL OF REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIPS- WE HAVE DEVELOP SOME PROGRAMS WITH- THE SURELY WHERE EDUCATION FUND WHICH IS- MADE UP THAT'S A JOINT APPRENTICESHIP COMMITTEE WITH SEIU UNITED HEALTH WORKERS AND WITH AND WITH KAISER PERMANENTE AA ANTIGONE THE HEALTH ON. ABOUT FIVE DIFFERENCE- ALLIED HEALTH CLASSIFICATIONS ARE THESE ARE STATEWIDE- BUT THE NUMBERS ARE REALLY SMALL- BECAUSE A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE- OUR OVERALL HEALTH CARE NUMBERS- WOULD BE LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED REGISTER PRINCES STATEWIDE AND WITH THAT SET UP- IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WE'RE LOOKING AT IT PROP TEN PERCENT. OF THAT NUMBER. BAKER THANK YOU- AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I JUST WISH COME BECAUSE OUT OF THE WHOLE PACKAGE IS ONE TO BE DOLLARS OF THAT I THINK BRIAN MENTIONED SO WE CAN IT- ESTIMATE 10% OF THE GO TO THE INLAND EMPIRE- THE FUNNY IT'S A LITTLE BIT. TRICKY FOR ME AS A DIVISION OF PRISM STANDARDS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CONTROL OF THE FUNDING DOLLARS. SO FOR THAT I THINK PROBABLY I'LL I'LL LET THE L. A. L. SPEAK SPECIFICALLY. YEAH I DON'T THERE ISN'T ANY- SPECIFIED REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDING SO I THINK THE 10% AMOUNT IS KIND OF ROUGHLY THE SHARE OF THE STATE'S WORKFORCE AND POPULATION THAT'S IN THE IN THE EMPIRE- BUT NO THERE IS NO- THERE ISN'T ANY PARTICULAR REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF MOST OF THOSE FUNDS AND AN APPRENTICESHIP CAN I GET OUT OF FUNDING THROUGH. BOTH EIGHTY DAYS OR THE WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT OR I CAN ONLY GET ONE SOURCE OF FUNDING FROM ONE GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THE SERVICE SO THE PRIVATE DIVISION OPPRESSION STANDARDS WHEN WE PUT TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS WELL WITH HIM EMPLOYERS EMPLOYER. ASSOCIATIONS WITH WITH LABOR PARTNERS WITH- WITH OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WE LOOK AT- SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT COULD BE- WHAT WE WOULD CALL- BRAIDED SO YOU COULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE SOURCE OF FUNDING. REALLY LOOKING AT SPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS MAKING SURE THAT- THEY POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE ACCESS WITH WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY DOLLARS THROUGH A LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARD- WE JUST RECENTLY LAUNCHED- SOMEWHAT HEALTH CARE RELATED. A HUGE INLAND EMPIRE CYBERSECURITY CONSORTIUM. IN CYBER SECURITY. AND ONE OF OUR KEY EMPLOYERS IS LOW MULLIN TO HEALTH. I'M REALLY LOOKING AT SPECIFICALLY TARGETING THE CYBER SECURITY NEEDS IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING. AND AND SO THE INLAND EMPIRE IS ONE OF THE REGIONS IN THE STATE THAT WERE REALLY ARE TARGETING BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP- THE TALENT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THERE IS A PREMIER INSTITUTION IN CSU SAMBAR TO DINO- THAT HAS A GLOBAL IMPACT. IN THEIR CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM. HOWEVER ALTHOUGH 75% OF THEIR STUDENTS WERE COMING FROM LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES INTO CSU SAMBAR TO DINO. VERY FEW WERE ABLE TO STAY AT HOME AND SO ENDED UP IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY LIKE PALO ALTO- IN IN- VIRGINIA- IN IN OTHER AREAS WHERE THERE'S A CYBER SECURITY NEED. AND SO THIS CONSORTIUM WAS REALLY TO TRY TO KEEP- THE BRAIN TALENT YET HOME. AND PROVIDE QUALITY JOBS YEAH IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IN SO WE HAD EMPLOYER SAID INCLUDED AS THREE- WHICH IS- NATIONAL DEFENSE CONTRACTOR AND REDLANDS- WE HAD- CONVERGE ONE WE HAVE ROB HALF INTERNATIONAL- SO THERE'S A BIG FOCUS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE- FOR US TO REALLY GROW APPRENTICESHIPS. AND WORK ACTUALLY MODELING. THE INLAND EMPIRE WAS THE FIRST ON THE CYBERSECURITY CONSORTIUM. WE'RE NOW TRYING TO MODEL THAT IN OTHER PARTS OF STATE RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY IS TO DO THE SAME THANK YOU. AND THEN ONE MORE QUESTION IS THERE ANY WAY AS US LEGISLATORS CAN HELP YOU STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR REGISTERING THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. YEAH SO IT IT IT APPRENTICESHIP OR IS REALLY REQUIRES- REALLY EMPLOYERS TO REALLY HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME TO REALLY DEVELOP THEIR WORKFORCE- THERE IS A BIG NEED. FOR EMPLOYERS TO GET QUALITY. OF WORKERS. AND SO. RIGHT NOW APPRENTICESHIP IS BEEN- WE'VE HAD MORE RECEPTION TO DEVELOPING REGISTERED APPRENTICES IN THESE NONTRADITIONAL AREAS- OVER THE LAST. TWO TO THREE YEARS IN A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ASSEMBLY IN PARTICULAR- PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE FUNDING. AND MORE OR MORE OPPORTUNITIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO DEVELOPING AN INFRASTRUCTURE AND PART OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES- IN ADMINISTRATIVE PIECE- I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER- COMMISERATING SABETTA TALKED ABOUT- **** CHAFEE COLLEGE AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH CALIFORNIA'S STEEL- THAT WAS A PROGRAM THAT WE DEVELOPED ABOUT THREE FOUR YEARS AGO AS WELL- THE KEY FOR US. IS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THEIR SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. TO THESE PROGRAMS THAT WILL SERVE MULTI EMPLOYERS. AND SERVE ACROSS- YOU KNOW THAT WE CONNECT SCALE THESE PROGRAMS UP SO WE'RE NOT SERVING JUST YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YOU KNOW THE APPRENTICES IN A COHORT BUT LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN- INCREASE THE NUMBERS INTO LIKE THE THOUSANDS- THROUGH. YOU KNOW ONE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM- I DO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT JUST REAL QUICK ON UP ON A- ON A PROGRAM THAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW IT'S IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL CSE- FACES- WITH THE CVS- ART WITH SPECIFICALLY- WE'RE WORKING TO DO DUAL. COMPENSATE BASED STANDARDS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IN THE DIVISION OF FRESH OF STANDARDS FOR THE HEALTH PHARMACY TECHNICIAN. CLASSIFICATION CVS OPERATES ABOUT NINE REGIONS WITH ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN STORES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE INTENTION TO HAVE. TEN APPRENTICES IN THE FIRST COHORT. YEAH THE INLAND EMPIRE- USUALLY THE PLAN TO HIRE. A NEW WORKER SO AND NOT INCOME IT WORKERS BUT AT SOME POINT WILL OFFER PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEIR EXISTING WORKFORCE. THEY ARE COMMITTED TO ADDING TWENTY SIX HUNDRED JOBS THROUGH THEIR PRESSURE PROGRAM BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO YOU CAN START SEEING SCALABILITY. AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF REGISTER PRINCES BY TEN THOUSAND OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS- THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. I SEE SEE THIS IS ALSO IN DEVELOPMENT A STATE REGISTERED PRE APPRENTICESHIP SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE PATHWAYS- FOR OUR DISADVANTAGED POPULATION SO THAT'S THAT'S A AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IS TO. DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE WE CAN SERVE LARGE NUMBERS- OF- INLAND EMPIRE RESIDENTS. THANK YOU DELIVER. WHICH RETURN. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF ONE OF THE STATISTICS THAT WE'VE HEARD OF SINCE ESPECIALLY SINCE KOBE IS THE IMPACT- UNEMPLOYMENT IS HAD ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN PARTICULARLY AND LATINOS VERY SPECIFICALLY YEAH- IT THE STATISTICS I'VE SEEN SHOW THAT THEY ARE THE MOST IMPACTED ON THE COME FROM THE LOW WAGE- JOBS ALSO AND I'M OFF TO THE SOLE PROVIDERS OF THEIR FAMILY. WHAT CAN WE AS LEGISLATORS DUE TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN AND PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN OF COLOR YEAH GREAT QUESTION AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DOES KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT WE ACTUALLY DO A REALLY GOOD JOB IN AN APPRENTICESHIP FOR HITTING AT THE CITY. WHAT WE DON'T DO A GOOD JOB IS THE GENDER AND HISTORICALLY MOST OF OUR REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN CONSTRUCTION AND FIREFIGHTING WHICH HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY MALE DOMINATED- PROFESSIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY AM EXCITED ABOUT IS THAT WHEN WE START DEVELOPING CAREERS IN HEALTH CARE- AND IN OTHER PROFESSIONS AND YOU KNOW WHITE COLLAR OR BLUE COLLAR PROFESSIONS- BECAUSE WE CAN TO DEVELOP APPRENTICESHIPS. IT OCT. THAT COULD BE ACCOUNTING OR OR- YOU KNOW IT YOU KNOW ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINANCE MARKETING- ENGINEERING. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY LOOKING AT IS HOW DO WE REALLY AFFECT WOMEN IN THEM WOMEN OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR- ACROSS ALL OF OUR REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS- WOMEN REPRESENT ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF APPRENTICES AND WE HAVE ABOUT NINETY ONE THOUSAND. TWO HUNDRED OR SO REGISTER PREMISES TODAY THAT ARE ACTIVE- WE GET INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIREFIGHTERS IN OUR SALUTE SHAME IT'S AN ABSOLUTE SHAME I WILL TELL YOU IF I MAY GO THAT OFTEN TIMES THINGS HAPPEN AND WE THINK WELL IT'S JUST THAT THERE ISN'T AN INTEREST. IF WE NOT ARE NOT INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHAT WE DO IT WILL NEVER BE CORRECTED. IT HAS TO BE INTENTIONAL AND IF IT MEANS SAYING THAT A PERCENTAGE HAVE TO BE WOMEN OR YOU START LOOKING AT. APPRENTICESHIPS APPRENTICESHIPS ARE FOR JOBS WE'RE MORE WOMEN WILL BE INTERESTED ARE DOING MORE OUTREACH SO THAT YOU HAVE THAT DIVERSITY SPECIFICALLY GENDER DIVERSITY. IF IT IS NOT INTENTIONAL I GUARANTEE YOU IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN YEAH. SO IF WE RECOGNIZE THAT LESS THAN 10% OF THE APPRENTICESHIP APPRENTICESHIPS ARE WOMEN YEAH. THEN WE KNOW SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE THAT ISN'T THAT IS MONEY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S NOT GOING TO PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO EVERYBODY OTHER THAN TO THE ONES THAT LOOK LIKE ME AND THAT THAT IS AN- ABSOLUTE SHAME AND I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE SOMETHING. TO CHANGE THAT YEAH THAT THAT IT AND AGAIN THE WORD IS INTENTIONALITY YEAH IF YOU ARE NOT INTENTIONAL ABOUT CHANGING IT IT WILL NOT CHANGE. AND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IN THAT MONEY NEEDS TO GO TO ALSO PROVIDE THE APPRENTICESHIPS FOR THE WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN WOMEN OF COLOR IT'S JUST WOMEN IN GENERAL WOMEN GENERAL AND I WILL SAY ABOUT NONTRADITIONAL FRIENDSHIP WHICH IS STILL NOT- YOU KNOW SOMETHING. IT THAT IS A CHALLENGE RIGHT- WE HAVE. OVER THE YEARS OUR OUR PROGRAMS HAVE TARGETED AS MUCH SAY CAN WE DO HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS OF PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE THAT'S BEEN SOME OF OUR CHALLENGES. AND BEING ABLE TO CALL OUT SPECIFIC ETHNICITY AND- GENDER OF REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO IT AGAIN YOU KNOW TO. PROMOTE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED- YOU KNOW GENDERS ARE OR WHAT HAVE YOU SO. I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS THIS IS IMPORTANT NOT TALKING ABOUT QUOTAS NOT NOT GETTING ABOUT BEING INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHAT WE DO RIGHT AND IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. WHO ARE WOMEN YOU ARE FAILING HIM BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT SERVING THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. 50% OF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA IS WOMEN. AND IF WE LOOK AT IF WE LOOK AT RACIAL DIFFERENCES THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT 60% OF THE POPULATION BEING LATINO. AND IF WOMEN AND LATINOS IN PARTICULAR ARE NOT BEING INCLUDED WE ARE FAILING. AND IF IT ISN'T UNUSUAL PROP TWO OH NINE THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE AND IF YOU THINK THAT IS THE ISSUE THEN YOU NEED TO GET A LEGAL OPINION SO THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE. THOSE WHO ARE BEING EXCLUDED BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT INCLUDING THEM YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING THAT IS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING THEM THAT IS ILLEGAL ALSO. SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT PROP TWO NINE AND BEING WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THAT FIGURE OUT TO GET THE LEGAL OPINION SO THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY BECAUSE IN THE END WE HAVE A GREAT SERVICE APPRENTICESHIPS. YEAH AND WE'VE GOT TO BE FAIR WITH EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA AND HALF THE POPULATION IS WOMEN YEAH AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY ARE BEING INCLUDED SO MAYBE IT'S WHO'S TEACHING THEM. MAYBE IT'S WHO IS GOING OUT TO RECRUIT MAYBE IT'S ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE RECRUITING BUT SOMETHING IS WRONG THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE DISCONNECT AND I DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR MY PASSION ON THE ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED. IT IS A DISSERVICE TO THE WOMEN AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT IS A LOT THE NIGHT DOES A DISSERVICE TO LET THE NOSE VERY SPECIFICALLY. SO I HOPE SOMETHING WILL BE DONE. VERY INTENTIONALLY. WHAT THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW I'M ASKING YOU TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS ILLEGAL OR IS AGAINST THE LAW. I'M ASKING YOU TO SEEK LEGAL OPINION. ABOUT HOW IT CAN BE DONE BECAUSE IT CAN BE DONE YEAH AND WE DO VIGOROUSLY. YOU HOW AT FROM A STATE POLICY RICK YOU KNOW HAVE- RECRUIT FOR WOMEN INTO THESE PROGRAMS. AT THE END OF THE DAY WORK WE'RE DEALING WITH EMPLOYERS THAT- ARE DEALING WITH THEIR INCOME A LOT OF TIMES ARE REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIPS WHEN THEY FIRST GET STARTED ARE USING THEIR INCOME BUT WORKERS- APPRENTICESHIP IS NOT REQUIRED. BY ANY ANYBODY OTHER THAN CONTRACTORS WORKING ON PUBLIC WORKS. SO REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP IS VOLUNTARY AND MANY OF THE EMPLOYERS HAVE TOLD US. THAT THE THAT. IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR THEM TO GO UNDER A REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP MODEL BECAUSE OF THE RULES THEY SEE IT AS A LOT OF TIMES A- REQUIREMENT FOR LABOR UNIONS THEY ALSO SEE IT AS- OF. VOLUNTARILY BEING- REGULATED BY THE STATE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT'S PART OF OUR CHALLENGES AS WELL IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH ACTUAL EMPLOYERS- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB WITH OUR OWN WORKFORCE- AND OUR PARTICIPATIONS ARE MUCH HIGHER FOR WOMEN CLOSER TO THE YOUR PASSION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO MOVE THE NEEDLE. AND AND MY PASSION IS TO ACTUALLY SEE REGISTERED APPRENTICES TO YOU KNOW MEET YOU KNOW A 50% GENDER- RATES- BECAUSE IT WOMEN REPRESENT 50% OF THE WORKFORCE SO THANK YOU. SO THAT CAN I ASK A DIFFERENT AREA FUNDING STRUCTURE ON HOW YOU WOULD TIME. I THINK WE'RE WITH ON. YEAH WELL HE WAS HAVE. WITH A CHANCE. AND WAREHOUSE. AND THAT'S OF THE LARGEST INDUSTRIES AND GROWING INDUSTRIES IN STAMINA DINO AREA EMPLOYING ABOUT NINE THOUSAND RESIDENTS YEAH. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECONOMIC VITALITY IN OUR AREA. BUT WE-ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTH OF THE RESIDENTS OF SAMBAR TO DINO. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO HOW CAN WE BEST WALK THE LINE IS SUPPORTING. THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. OF OUR WORD AND WE'LL JUST AND TO THE GOODS MOVEMENT. YEAH BALANCING THAT THE HEALTH THE TREE AND- THAT'S A GREAT FOR US AT YOU KNOW I I'M A PART OF THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THE THREE THERE'S THREE TENANTS THAT WE WERE THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT QUALITY JOBS. IN ORDER THESE JOBS THAT ARE. IT PAYING JOBS THAT ALLOW- WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEIR FAMILIES. SECOND WE LOOK FOR. YOU KNOW IS OR IN EQUITY PIECE AND THEN GETS BACK TO ALSO MAKING SURE THAT- OUR FRIENDSHIPS REFLECT THE COMMUNITY THAT. WE SERVE. AND THEN FINALLY IS LOOKING AT YOU KNOW AS A AS WE TRANSITION TO A CLIMATE FRIENDLY- YOU KNOW FOSSEL FREE ENVIRONMENT OVER THE NEXT YOU KNOW FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO- HOW DO WE GET- IT JUST TRANSITION BUT INTO INTO GOOD. QUALITY JOBS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- WHEN WE LOOK AT LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION SO WE LOOK AT LOOKING AT OF PROFESSIONS THAT HAVE A WORKER VOICE. FOR HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN REALLY- ABOUT- INDUSTRY THAT'S GOING TO AGAIN LEAD TO. GOOD CAREERS BUT ALSO- LOOKING FOR JOBS OF THE FUTURE THAT WILL ALLOW FOR- EIGHT YOU KNOW I JUST TRANSITION AS WE MOVE INTO IT AGAIN- CLIMB MITIGATION TYPE OF STRATEGIES THAT WERE EMPLOYED SO- WHEN WE LOOK AT LOGISTICS A LOT OF WITH THE WORKING WITH LABOR MANAGEMENT. UNIONS TO ENSURE THAT AND WORKERS ARE GETTING A GOOD WAGE AND BENEFITS. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE A KEY FOR US. AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN THAT AREA. SO WE WORK CLOSELY WITH- YOU KNOW GROUPS LIKE THE TEAMSTERS AND OTHERS THAT MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE LOGISTICS PART- IN THE WAREHOUSE SIDE OF THE HOUSE. THERE HAS BEEN- AREAS WHERE A LOT OF THESE JOBS ARE LOW PAYING JOBS AND AT TIMES- WHERE WORKERS GET TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WITH WAGE THEFT AND OUR COUNTERPARTS AT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WOULD BE PROBABLY BETTER SERVE TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE- WITH WAREHOUSE- EMPLOYEES AND SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- LEGISLATION- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO REALLY ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BRIAN TELL TO TELL CHAO'S WE'RE VERY HAPPY FOR HIM AND- CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS BABY- I JUST HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION FOR ME ONE- MISTRUTH IN CREATING WE TALK ABOUT THE EARLIER PROGRAMS HOW COULD WE GET A BALANCE GETTING TRAINEES EXPERIENCE THEY NEED WHILE ALSO ENSURING PLACEMENT SITES ARE GAINING VALUE AND TRAINEES ARE NOT OVERSTEPPING THEIR ABILITIES. YEAH SO I MEAN THE B. REALLY BUILDING UP REGISTER PRESSURE PROGRAM START WITH- REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS OF WHAT THE JOB IS GOING TO ENTAIL. IT'S INSURING THAT THEIR SUCCESSES THROUGH PRE APPRENTICESHIPS THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE TRAINING THAT WILL MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL AS THEY ENTER INTO THE JOB MARKET- IN A LOT OF APPRENTICESHIPS OR MAYBE A REQIREMENT FOR. FOR ADDITIONAL MATHEMATICAL SKILLS AND SO DID. THE PRE APPRENTICESHIPS REALLY SERVE TO REALLY- PROVIDE A INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THEM TO GAIN- WHAT WE WOULD CALL- SOFT SKILLS OR SKILLS THAT ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO INTERVIEW WELL AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL NOT ON THE JOB SO- THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM STANDARDS ARE THE- ARE THE VEHICLE THAT KIND OF. WILL OUTLINE THE CROSSWALK OF THE OF THE OF THE- WORK PROCESSES THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN A REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. AND IN THE COURSE THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY TO ENSURE THAT THE QUALITY- THERE'S QUALITY IN THE CURRICULUM AS WE AS WE BUILD THESE. AVERAGE DEPARTURE PROGRAM SELF OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IF NOT WE'LL GO ON TO OUR NEXT. ALSO THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON MISTER ROUTE FOR OUR BEING HERE TODAY APPRECIATE THAT AND- NOW WE MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT TOWN. NO LIKE TO INVITE MISS HANDS HERMANSSON ADVICE JONES OR BRIAN UP FOR SECOND PANEL. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME DRYER HERMANSSON DIRECTOR OF INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH FUTURE HEALTH. RITUAL BEGAN IN CALIFORNIA HAS GROWN ACROSS THE NATION AS A PREMIER ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS THE GROWTH OF EARNERS LEARN MODELS WELCOME IS ARMS AND MISS HERMANSSON I'M PLEASED THAT WE HAVE HERE TO SHARE YOUR SUCCESSES AND DISCUSS. HOW WE CAN EFFECTIVELY PROMOTE EARN A LUMP OPPORTUNITIES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE SO WHEN YOU'RE READY. BUTTON DOWN THERE YOU GO. AFTER CHAIR A ESTEEMED COMMITTEE MY AND- AS DIRECTOR OF INNOVATIVE PARTNER F. TO A WHOLE I'M PRETTY HUMBLED AND TO YOU TODAY. MY BACKGROUND. ASSEMBLY IS IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY IN HUMAN RESOURCES AND OPERATIONS I HAVE SPENT DECADES LOOKING FOR THE BEST PEOPLE EVER. I ALSO I'M A LONG TIME FACULTY MEMBER AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN BUSINESS AND IN CAREER TECHNOLOGY TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AND MY LAST ROLE PRIOR TO THIS WAS AS STATEWIDE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WORKFORCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIVISION IN RETAIL HOSPITALITY TOURISM. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING. I KNOW YOU ALL KNOW THIS IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND THE CALIFORNIA CAN YOU CALL IT SYSTEM IS THE LAW PLANET'S LARGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND I WILL SAY WITH A TRUE PRIDE THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE IS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE REGIONS IN THE STATE. I ACTUALLY BEFORE I LEFT WAS ABLE TO- LAUNCH A VIRTUAL MARKETING INTERNSHIP THAT TIDE BARSTOW AND COPPER MOUNTAIN COLLEGE- WITH THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE REGION TO PILOT- SOCIAL MEDIA AND DIGITAL ANALYTICS SKILLS. FOR STUDENTS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES THIS IS ONE THAT- IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF JUST ONE EXAMPLE I YOU'VE MENTIONED CHAFEE. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL OBVIOUSLY BUT- I WILL AS YOU CAN TELL I HAVE GREAT PRIDE AS BOTH FACULTY MEMBER AS WELL AS SOMEONE WHO IS OUT OF THE WORKFORCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TABLE ON BOTH SIDES. SOI'M VERY VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH YOU I'VE BUILT MANY NUMEROUS- EMPLOYER STUDENT PARTNERSHIPS INTERNSHIPS AND APPRENTICESHIPS. I FEEL LIKE THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR US TO REALLY MAKE THESE APPRENTICESHIPS- MAKE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE. I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FOR TORO HEALTH AND HOW WE HOPE TO PARTNER. ACROSS THE STATE TO MAKE ALL OF THIS CHANGE A REAL. FEDERAL HEALTH AS YOU MAY KNOW WAS ESTABLISHED IT'S A NONPROFIT. A UNIQUE NONPROFIT ESTABLISHED WITH THE COMMITMENT OF A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS BY AN EMPLOYER. KAISER PERMANENT SAY AND THE SEIU UNITED HEALTHCARE WORKERS WEST A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS STRONG. YOU MUST KNOW A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED UNIQUELY WHEN A UNION AND THE- EMPLOYER WORK TOGETHER TRUE. AND SO OUR JOB AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM MISTER RICHARD THAT- FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES ALONE IN CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND WE'VE HEARD THAT THIS BIG NUMBERS IN YOUR REGION AS WELL. OUR MISSION IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WEALTH OF COMMUNITIES BY GOING THE LARGEST NETWORK OF CREDENTIALED ALLIED HEALTH WORKERS STARTING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND CREATING A MODEL. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A DIVERSE ECOSYSTEM WE BUILD A PATH FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. FROM AWARENESS OF THESE JOB OPPORTUNITIES TO RECRUITMENT TRAINING WORK BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCES WHICH WE HOPE WILL BE MORE APPRENTICESHIPS. IN AN ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSION. EMPLOYERS FROM HOSPITAL AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ARE AMONG THE EMPLOYER ADVISORS TO INFORM OUR ANNUAL TRAINING ROAD MAP. FUTURE HEALTH SUPPORTS APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVES TO FULFILL OUR GOAL OF TRAINING CREDENTIALING AND PLACING AN EMPLOYMENT TEN THOUSAND ALLIED HEALTH WORKERS. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT FOR SURE- HEALTH STARTED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. THREE MONTHS. LATER THE WORLD SHUT DOWN AND YET WE WERE ABLE TO TRAIN FIFTY OVER FIFTY SIXTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES- START SIXTEEN HUNDRED WORKERS IN THAT FIRST YEAR WE ARE ON TRACK TO TRAIN THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED. THESE ARE TRAININGS THAT BECAUSE OF OUR FUNDING GENEROUS FUNDING FROM THESE AMAZING PARTNERS. HAVE ZERO TUITION BARRIER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE SCHOLARSHIP THEM ALL. I APPRECIATE THE PASSION THAT- COMMITTEE MEMBER GóMEZ REYES WAS SHARING. WE ADVERTORIALS ARE INTENTIONAL IN WHAT WE DO WE PLAN TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT IS INCLUSIVE. AGILE IN THAT IT MEETS WORKERS WHERE THEY CAN BE NOT IN A CLASSROOM FOR TO SAY NOT. AT UPSET HOURS BUT- ONLINE ND HYBRID MODELS AND ALSO THAT WE CAN LEARN HOW TO DO THIS TO SCALE IT. AND OUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO DO THESE THINGS SO WE HAVE URGENCY ABOUT DOING THIS. WE ALREADY HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD FOR SERVING DIVERSE STUDENTS AND THEIR NEEDS. IN JUST TWENTY MONTHS SINCE WE LAUNCHED FUTURE HEALTH IS ALREADY CREATED THESE OPPORTUNITIES AS I MENTIONED TO OVER FOUR THOUSAND ADULTS. TO OBTAIN THEIR HEALTHCARE CREDENTIAL. WE WORK WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND THEIR EDUCATIONAL STUDENT JOURNEY. IN INDUSTRY VALUED CREDENTIALS OUR STUDENT POPULATION LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT OUR DEMOGRAPHICS- 70% FEMALE. I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA SNAP ON ONE YOU GO. ANSWERED OUR OUR OUR BACK OF OUR STUDENTS ARE VERY ETHNICALLY DIVERSE 46% LATIN ACTS 21% BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN 11% WHITE 12% ASIAN 10% OTHERS OUR AVERAGE AGE IS THIRTY. SAYS YOU SAW FROM THE HANDOUT THAT I GAVE YOU THESE ARE WORKING ADULTS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO NOT WORK. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT- THANK YOU SEE OUR- OVER A THIRD ARE BILINGUAL AND THAT'S IN MULTI LANGUAGES. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE MOST PROUD OF IS OUR OUTREACH AND RECRUITMENT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE EQUITY HERE AND SO FOLKS NEED ACCESS TO BOTH THE JOBS AS WELL AS TO UNDERSTANDING WHY THIS IS VALUABLE TO THEM. WE ARE VERY. PROUD OF OUR CONNECTION WITH THE S. C. I. U. U. H. W. WHO IS OUR ARGEST RECRUITER WE ALSO WORK WITH OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AND EDUCATION PROVIDERS WE PROVIDE INFORMATIONAL SYSTEM. INFORMATIONS SESSIONS PRE STUDENT ORIENTATIONS WE ALSO TRY ARE TRYING NEW WAYS TO TALK TO PEOPLE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY READS THE PAPER OR READ AN EMAIL A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT THEIR PHONE AND SO THEY HAS TO COME FROM TRUSTED RESOURCES- REFERRAL PROGRAMS- AND COUNTY WORKFORCE BOARDS ALL OF THESE THINGS HELP US GROW INTEREST IN EDUCATIONAL. OPPORTUNITIES IN TERMS OF STUDENT SUPPORT I HAVE COME FROM EDUCATION I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES STUDENTS COME O OUR SYSTEM AND THEY GET LOST. THEY GET LOST IT'S VERY UNCLEAR HOW TO GET TO THESE PATHWAYS. ONE OF THE THINGS WE OFFER A FUTURE HEALTH IS THAT WE HAVE A FUTURE HEALTH NAVIGATOR THAT ONCE A STUDENT IS REGISTERED WITH US THE NAVIGATOR STAYS WITH THEM THROUGH. DECIDING WHICH PROGRAM TO GO TO DECIDING WHICH EDUCATIONAL PARK PATHWAY MIGHT BE THE BEST AND THEN ENCOURAGES THING ENCOURAGING THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS. THROUGH THE FIFTEEN MONTHS TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT IS ON YOUR SHOULDER YOUR LITTLE ANGEL THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE VERY PROUD OF AND OUR OUTCOMES HAVE SHOWN THAT- WE HAVE A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COMES UP SUCCESS OUTCOMES- FOR OUR PROGRAMS. STUDENTS ARE SUPPORTED ALONG EVERY STEP OF THEIR JOURNEY- AND ON. PAIRING FOR ANY LICENSURE EXAMS THAT ARE NEEDED. ONE LAST THING I WANT TO SURE ABOUT WHAT WE DO THAT'S SPECIAL. WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED HUMAN TOUCH HEALTH CARE. AGAIN YOU KNOW THAT MY BACKGROUND IS RETAIL HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM ONE OF THINGS I PARTNERED WITH AT AT MY AST ROLE WAS TO. INVITE UP PEOPLE FROM HOSPITALITY TO LOOK AT JOBS IN HEALTH CARE IT ACTUALLY WAS PILOTED HERE IN SACRAMENTO WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND SET UP. A HOSPITALITY TO HEALTH CARE POSITION YOU LOST YOUR JOB YOUR RESTAURANTS CLOSED COME WORK FOR- INSTITUTIONAL- HEALTH CARE IT COULD BE LONG TERM CARE COULD BE A SENIOR LIVING A COULD BE A HOSPITAL. WE NEED CULINARY PEOPLE THERE TOO. SO ONCE YOU EVEN IF YOU HAVE THIS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED THOUGH IT MAY BE CHALLENGING. SO WE'VE WE'VE CREATED HUMAN TOUCH HEALTH CARE WHICH PROVIDES COMPETENCIES IN. SIX AREAS EMPATHY AND COMPASSION. CULTURAL COMPETENCE BECAUSE WE'RE TREATING PEOPLE FROM ALL KINDS OF BACKGROUNDS. EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE SO THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES TEAMWORK AND COLLABORATION AND ETHICS AND INTEGRITY ALL OF THESE CONTEXTUALIZED AROUND A HEALTH CARE SETTING. SO WE'RE SETTING UP PEOPLE WHO ARE NEW MAYBE HAVE NEVER HAD EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. WE ALSO HAVE THINGS SUCH AS A MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY INTRODUCTION COURSE SO YOU GET THIS BEFORE YOU BEGIN YOUR TRAINING. AND WE CAN HOPEFULLY INCREASE THE SUCCESS FACTOR AND WE ALSO HAVE- A SPANISH TO ENGLISH CLASS WHERE YOU PEOPLE CAN LEARN THOSE TERMINOLOGIES ALSO AND HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE- WE BELIEVE THAT APPRENTICESHIPS ARE A WIN WIN. I WILL SAY THAT NOT ONLY IS IT ERIC SPOKE ABOUT THE BENEFITS TO EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS WE KNOW FOR STUDENTS. IT TAKES THE RISK OUT OF POST SECONDARY TRAINING. I CAME FROM IMMIGRANT FAMILY AS WELL I WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN MY FAMILY TO COMPLETE COLLEGE. AND IT'S A HUGE RISK TO PUT ON YOUR STUDENT- WORK OR PAVE PAY MORE. AND WHEN WE DON'T WHEN WE HAVE AN APPRENTICESHIP WE HAVE NOT ONLY A JOB AT THE END BUT- INDUSTRY RECOGNIZED CREDENTIAL THAT MAKES YOU MORE EMPLOYABLE GOING FORWARD. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT IT'S REALLY. THE BRASS RING WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN WE HAVE AN APPRENTICE IS WE CONTRACT EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. SO IN THE EDUCATION WORLD WE TRAIN THEN WE COMPLETE THIS CERTIFICATION WE HOPE THEY TELL US THAT THEY GOT A JOB- THIS- WE HOPE TO REPORT THEIR WAGES BUT WE DON'T KNOW. WHEN WE HAVE THESE APPRENTICES WE CAN TRACK WHERE THEY ARE AND WE CAN PARTNER WITH EMPLOYEES TO ALSO UPSKILL EXISTING. UP WITH EMPLOYERS TO X. UPSKILL EXISTING EMPLOYEES AND BUILD ON THAT SO- FOR US THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVE AND- I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOCUS ON IT I FEEL THAT THE TIME. WE ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME TO MAKE THIS IMPACT TOGETHER IT AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR- FOR HAVING US HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND LAST WE HAVE WITH US. PRESENTED AS VICE CHANCELLOR O'BRIEN. THANK YOU FOR PAYING TODAY. PARDEE JOINING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES LAST YEAR MISTER BRIAN WAS THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS. AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. OF A SHELTER WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH TALKBACK TO FOLLOW WILL DO MY BEST YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR RODRIGUEZ AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS DAVID O'BRIEN VICE CHANCELLOR FOR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. FROM IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY DISCUSSING THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND I WANTED SPECIFICALLY CALL OUT AND THANK THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE THROUGH LEGISLATION THIS YEAR AB TWELVE SEVENTY THREE. OTHER WE THINK IT'S GOING TO EXPAND THESE EARN AND LEARN OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORK FORCE BRIEFLY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS THE SYSTEM OFFICE OVERSEEING CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES- AND THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS WE SERVE INCLUDING THROUGH A VARIETY OF WORK FORCE PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES LED BY WORKFORCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIVISION. WE ALSO PRODUCE SOME PRETTY OUTSTANDING ALUMNI FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OURSELF AS YOU CAN SEE. I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS SOME CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF EARN AND LEARN MODELS FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE RESPECTED THE SYSTEM OFFICE PERSPECTIVE. INCLUDING FLEXIBILITY AND INCENTIVES AND HOW OR LEARN HELPS PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE OFTEN PREDATORY FOR PROFIT INDUSTRY. AS A RELEASE THE FLEXIBILITY- A KEY COMPONENT OF SUCCESSFUL EARN AND LEARN MODEL IS FLEXIBILITY AS WE LOOK TO EXPAND THEM YOU KNOW TO NEW INDUSTRIES WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE A LARGE% BUSINESSES. RIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS WELL THAT YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. WE ALSO NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT STANDARDS FOR APPRENTICESHIPS AND- SITUATIONS WHERE THEY MAY SET TOO HIGH OF A BAR FOR SOME BUSINESSES TO PARTICIPATE WHICH IN TURN MEANS THAT OUR COLLEGES CAN'T PARTICIPAT BECAUSE A BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP IS REQUIRED FOR COLLEGES. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE CONSIDERING THE FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE OTHER MODELS OF EARN AND LEARN AS WELL OUTSIDE OF THE FORMAL APPRENTICESHIP PROCESS ALTHOUGH DOES CONFIRM ANY BENEFITS AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GREATER FLEXIBILITY. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT COMPROMISING PROGRAM QUALITY OR- LOWERING ANY OF OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR OUTCOMES. COLLECTING QUALITY DATA AND REPORTING ON OUTCOMES IS STILL ESSENTIAL. AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE MORE COMMITTED TO THAT THAN EVER. THANKS TO INCENTIVES THERE DO NEED TO BE SUFFICIENT INCENTIVES BUILT INTO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE TYPES OF WORK BASED LEARNING ON THE JOB- WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW BENEFIT BOTH STUDENTS AND BUSINESSES AND THEY NEED TO BE THE RIGHT TYPES OF INCENTIVES SO WE THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE PAYROLL TAX BREAKS AND CREDITS WHICH WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST AS A SUCCESSFUL MODEL. ANOTHER EFFECTIVE INCENTIVE WHICH REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT MORE SET UP FROM THE SORT OF GOVERNMENT AND FUNNY PERSPECTIVE IS TO SUBSIDIZE WAGES OF STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN WORK BASED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES WITH EMPLOYERS SO UNDER THIS APPROACH THE WAGES THE NECESSARILY HAVE TO FLOW TO THE EMPLOYER BUT COULD BE IN THE FORM OF FOR EXAMPLE A STIPEND THAT A STUDENT RECEIVES UNDER A WORK BASED LEARNING PROGRAM ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THIS WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE- PAYING PEOPLE TO GO TO SCHOOL. RIGHT AS AS JOY MENTIONED. THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO WORK. BUT THEY NEED THAT EDUCATION THEY NEED THAT TRAINING SO WE CAN PROVIDE THEM THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT. TO COMPLETE THAT WATER GETTING THAT TRAINING THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AS WE LOOK TO NONTRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES AND EXPANDING APPRENTICESHIP AND EARN AND LEARN THEIR I KEEP PRIORITY OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS EXPANDINGBEYOND SOME OF THOSE TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES. AS WELL AS MOVING BEYOND JUST HEALTH CARE HEALTH CARE IS IMPORTANT BUT IN THOSE MALLS ARE WELL SUITED TO APPRENTICESHIP. FRONT LOADED EDUCATION TRAINING WITH HANDS ON PRACTICE AND SO FORTH. BUT WE DO NEED THE FLEXIBILITY AS MAJORITY LEADER REYES NOTED TO EXPAND- NO LEARN INTO A NEW AND INNOVATIVE INDUSTRY SECTORS. SUCH AS BIOTECH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS ADVANCED MANUFACTURING AND SO FORTH SECTORS WITH GOOD LIVING WAGE JOBS. THESE INDUSTRIES ARE GROWING RAPIDLY ESPECIALLY IN AREAS LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT WORKFORCE NEEDS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN HELP FILL THIS GAP. I WANT TO ALSO NOTE THAT EARNING LEARN IN PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN SERVE AS AN EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO FOR PROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR PROFIT COLLEGES HAVE A SIZEABLE PRESENCE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE BUT THEY OFTEN LEAVE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WITH HIGH AMOUNTS OF DEBT. COMPROMISED THEIR ABILITY TO REACH THE MIDDLE CLASS AND DEGREES AND CREDENTIALS THE DON'T DON'T AFFORD THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THOSE HIGH WAGE JOBS COMMUNITY COLLEGE EARN AND LEARN PROGRAMMES. PROVIDE A COUNTERBALANCE TO FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS WE OFFER LOW COST HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE TRAINING TO CONSISTENTLY LEADS TO HIGH PAYING JOBS. ANOTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS ON CROSS AGENCY COLLABORATION. YOU SEE MULTIPLE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGENCIES REPRESENTED HERE TODAY. IN ORDER FOR US TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL OF EARNING LEARN. EDUCATION THERE NEEDS TO BE GREATER COLLABORATION ACROSS THESE VARIOUS PUBLIC AGENCIES. TO REDUCE DUPLICATION. LEVERAGE EACH OTHER'S RESOURCES AND BETTER UTILIZE LIMITED FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING. SUPPORTS TRAINING EDUCATION BASIC NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FINANCIAL AID WHICH IS CRITICAL. IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE COUPLED WITH- JUST TO USE ONE EXAMPLE LABOR AGENCY FUNDING THAT COULD BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE WAGES INTERNSHIPS ARE ON A LEARN PROGRAMS SHARING OF DATA ON OUTCOMES TO EXTEND MORE SERVICES TO HELP THE STUDENTS SEEKING WORK TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN THERE IS ONE FINAL CRITICAL COMPONENT- THAT I THINK SPEAKS TO WHAT THE MAJORITY LEADER REYES EARLIER WHICH IS INTENTIONALLY DESIGNING WORKFORCE EDUCATION TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS. IT'S SO IMPORTANT I. I DIDN'T HAVE IT PLANNED TO ADDRESS MY REMARKS BUT- IT OCCURRED TO ME AS THE MAJORITY LEADER SPEAKING ON THIS THAT. I VISITED ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES RECENTLY. AT A- AND- MY VOICE WANTS TO HELP OUT WITH THIS PROBLEM. I VISITED ONE OF OUR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS RECENTLY I WAS A CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM WE GOT TO MEET THE STUDENTS THEY SHRED SOME INSPIRING INCREDIBLE STORIES. ABOUT WHAT I'VE DONE FOR THEM. BUT THERE WERE NO WOMEN MMHM AND THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS AND WE POINTED IT OUT TO THEM. AND THE INSTRUCTOR SAID HE AGREED THAT WITH THE PROBLEM. AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE WANTED TO WORK ON AND RECOGNIZED NEEDED TO BE WORKED ON SO. I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER I WISH I HAD THE ANSWER HERE TODAY BUT I THINK THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT IT I THINK OUR ELECTED OFFICIAL CONTINUING TO PROCESS ON IT IS PART OF THE ANSWER YEAH DESIGNING. TO INTENTIONALLY CLOSE EQUITY GAPS. SO I HOPE THIS IS BEEN HELPFUL AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AGAIN FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE- AND THE MEMBERS FOR RAISING OTHER ISSUES AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WITHOUT THE MOTION SIR- THANK YOU BOTH AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WHICH I. ARE QUICK ONE HERE FOR YOU JOY. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP EMPLOYERS UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF THE EARN AND LEARN MODELS ANYTHING MORE WE CAN DO TO. INCENTIVIZE THEM AND GET THEM UP TO SPEED WITH. I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT WE HAVE GOING THAT'S A BARRIER. WE'VE NEVER TOLD THE STORY. OF WHY. WHAT'S IN IT FOR THEM AND WHY IT'S NOT AS COMPLICATED AS WE ALL THINK IT IS. YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK. I'M LAUGHING BECAUSE REMEMBER WHEN WE ALL FIRST LEARNED TO DRIVE GO BACK TO WHEN YOU WERE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YOU'RE LEARNING TO DRIVE I HAD TO LEARN TO DRIVE A STICK SHIFT AND IT SEEMS VERY SCARY. AND THEN TO THINK ABOUT RIGHT I LEARNED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO THIS IS MENTIONED THAT IT WAS HOT. AND I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME GOING TO FREEWAY. IT ALSO WHILE THAT FOR SOME OF US BUT- THEN REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME YOU DROVE IN A STORM AT NIGHT. WHEN YOU'RE TIRED. OR YOU HAD A CARLOAD OF PEOPLE AND YOU WERE YOUR NAME WHY NOT GOING THROUGH. NOW YOU DRIVE ON THE EIGHTY YOU'REDRIVING WITH YOUR KNEE OR TEXTING YOU'RE DRINKING A LOT YOU KNOW I'M JUST SAYING THAT. IT SEEMS VERY HARD WHEN YOU ARE WE HAVEN'T DONE IT BEFORE AND I WE JUST TO HAVE A TOLD THE STORY. TO EMPLOYERS IT'S ACTUALLY AT LESS COST FOR THEM THEY GET FIRST CRACK AT THE BEST AND MOTIVATED EMPLOYEES. THEY GET TO DETERMINE WHAT THE STANDARDS THE WORK THE WORK PROCESSES THEY COULD DETERMINE WHAT WILL BE IN THE TRAINING. SO REALLY- I THINK THAT AND THEN ALSO ON THE PUBLIC SIDE ONE OF THE THINGS I WORKED ON. IN THE MY PASTORAL WAS. UP A HEALTHY SCHOOL FOOD INITIATIVE TO TAKE CULINARY STUDENTS TO GO TO WORK AT A K. TWELVE. SYSTEM TO COOK SCRATCH COOKED FOOD THAT IS HEALTHY SUSTAINABLY GROWN NEARBY. BUT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM CAN APPLY TO THE COPY FOR. GRANTS BECAUSE- THEY HAVE A SET NUMBER OF. FUNDS THEY CAN USE TOWARDS- WORK AND THERE'S BARRIERS SO IT'S A PUBLIC ENTITY THAT MAYBE WANTS TO HAVE AN APPRENTICE OR INTERN. BUT WE SOMEHOW NOT CONNECTED THE DOTS SAME WITH PUBLIC HEALTH WE ARE LOOKING AT BUILDING UP PUBLIC WE WERE OUT WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH I. T. PROGRAM WITH CSU LONG BEACH AND UC BERKELEY. BUT THOSE PEOPLE END UP AT PUBLIC HEALTH- OFFICES HOW CAN WE TAKE AWAY THOSE BEARS S WE'RE NOT JUST SUPPORTING PRIVATE INDUSTRY OR ANY OF ANY SIZE BUT BE ABLE TO HELP THEM ALSO PARTICIPATE IN GETTING THESE WORKERS BECAUSE WE NEED THEM OBVIOUSLY IN THIS PUBLIC SECTOR. SO THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A COUPLE AREAS I HOPE WE CAN ADDRESS. ANY QUESTION LIKE TWENTY MEMBERS. SMITTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER YES WELL THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS TODAY AND I'M A GOOD ENJOY FIRST BECAUSE ALWAYS REFER TO WOMEN OF THAT THE INTERWAR THAT THE SPEAKER WITH A PARTNERSHIP THROUGH KAISER AND SEIU FOR THE FOR TOUR HEALTH USER PROGRAM DO THEY HAVE TO GIVE BACK AFTER THEY'VE MADE THEIR INVESTMENT IN THE STUDENT THEY HAVE TO WORK SO LONG- THAT THROUGH KAISER OR BE A MEMBER S. YEAH YOU ASK IF THERE'S SO MANY. GREAT QUESTION NO. OKAY SO DURING THE COPA TIMES ARE ARE WE ARE FULLY SCHOLARSHIP THING ALL OUR STUDENTS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE IN THE PROGRAMS. AND- WHEN STUDENTS REGISTER THEY ARE OFFERED THE OPTION TO JOIN AS AN ASSOCIATE MEMBER OF- S. C. R. U. H. W. YEAH BUT IT'S AN OPTION THEY IT'S NOT A PRE IT'S NOT A PRE REQUISITE OF GETTING INTO THE TRAINING. AND THEN ONCE THEY FINISH- THEY'RE ALSO SHOWING THE BENEFITS OF LIFE JOINING THE UNIT WOULD HELP THEM AN EMPLOYMENT AND MENTORSHIP AND SUPPORT. ALSO NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR A COUPLE ONCE YOU'VE COMPLETED SO THERE'S NO. STRINGS ATTACHED THERE IS A ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR REGISTRATION FEE WHICH WE ASK OF ALL STUDENTS SO WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE REALLY INVESTED- OUR TEAM IS ALSO WORKING ON PLACES WHERE- TRACK FOR EXAMPLE IT OR IN ORANGE COUNTY THE WORK FORCE FOR THEIR HAS APPROVED THAT THEY WILL. THEY WILL PAY FOR THAT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THEIR CLIENTS IN THEIR- EMPLOYMENT NEEDS SERVICES AREA- BUT THEN THE TUITION WHICH CAN RANGE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE R. FUNDING COMPLETELY COVERS AND THERE'S- THERE'S NO OBLIGATION THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING I'M A PART OF THE NONPROFIT WHERE WE PAY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND WE PAID A HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS LAST YEAR. THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS FEE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY pMONEY YES HELLO. IT WOULD TAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS IS NOT FOR A CHILD COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT THAT'S A GOOD CHUNK OF CHANGE ABSOLUTELY AND THEN YOU MENTIONED COPPER MOUNTAIN BARS TO COLLEGE. BOTH OF THOSE ARE MY DISTRICT VICTOR VALLEY COLLEGE'S THERE WE'RE WORKING WAIT GREAT WITH THE COMMUNITY. COLLEGE SYSTEM TO TRAIN OUR STUDENTS LITTLE KNOW THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES AND THEIR SCHOLARSHIPS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS YES STUDENTS BUT WE'RE TRYING TO TIE THE SCHOLARSHIP. WITH HOUSING SO THEY KNOW NO WORRIES AT ALL THEN THAT'S REALLY IS BIG IS A BIG DISPARITY YOU STILL GOT A LIVE AT HOME MOM AND DAD BECAUSE THEY'LL PUT YOU UP. TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT YOU GOT THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE STILL UP I LOOK FORWARD TO THE RELATIONSHIP FROM BUILDINGS. THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY FOR BEING HERE TODAY. YEAH THE WORK FORCE THE- TO. OF A OF- THE- PERSON YOU WE SIX. CAN AND REGIONAL- JULIE KEVIN IT AND THEY'RE THERE AT EXCELLENT THIS FOSTERING OF INNOVATION I'D SAY. IT'S A TRUE A CHAFEE WAS MENTIONED YOU KNOW SAMBAR DEER VALLEY THERE'S- THERE'S- I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU. EXCITING THINGS HAPPENING EVERY DAY. EARLIER YOU HAVE A QUESTION THANK YOU THE VICE CHANCELLOR I DIE I AM A GRADUATE OF MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE- MY HUSBAND IS A TRUSTEE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT HE WORKED THERE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS SO COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE IN MY BLOOD. AND I EVERY OPPORTUNITY I HAVE I WILL ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF FOR STUDENTS TO GO TO TWO YEARS AT LEAST TWO OR THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHETHER IT'S A- FOR CERTIFICATE OR IT IS THEY WANT I AM ABSOLUTELY SOLD ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THE BEST THING CALIFORNIA HAS TO OFFER- AND NOT JUST OUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BUT- EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO GET THAT EXTRA EDUCATION. SO I THANK YOU I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT- THE QUESTION I HAVE IS- SPECIFICALLY WITH OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS THE THIS GROUP MOST OF OUR STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID. HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE ENTICE THEM SO THAT THEY WILL EXPLORE THEIR EARN AND LEARN PROGRAMMES DURING THEIR TIME IN COLLEGE SO WHILE TAKING THEIR REGULAR- I'M SO SORRY TAKING THE REGULAR COURSES BUT TO ALSO DO THIS PROGRAM FOR- EARN AND LEARN. YEAH THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE WHAT WE'RE FINDING WITH- ESPECIALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IS. THE REALITY IS THE LOT OF THEM HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON YOU KNOW THEIR LIVES ESPECIALLY SINCE QUOTED. HOME SITUATION THIRD DEALING WITH FAMILY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF YOUNGER CHILDREN PARENTS SIBLINGS WHOEVER. WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS SO I WOULD SAY AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE ONE OF THE THINGS WERE OBSERVING. IS THAT- IT'S BEST TO TAKE IT TO THE STUDENT IF POSSIBLE. RIGHT SO THAT COULD INCLUDE MODELS OF OUTREACH WHERE- INSTRUCTORS AND SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS COME INTO THEIR FELLOW INSTRUCTORS CLASSROOMS WHICH I HOPE THEY WOULDN'T BE WAS COMPETITION BUT RATHER AS- RATHER IS A BENEFIT RIGHT TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS- THAT ORIENTATION COMMUNICATIONS COULD BE INCLUDED STUDENT ORIENTATION- THAT COULD BE INCLUDED WHEN STUDENTS GO INTO THAT. FINANCIAL AID OFFICE TO BE ON CHOIR ABOUT THE FINANCIAL AID THE STATUS OF THE RAID. WE CAN TRY TO ENSURE THEY GET INFORMATION THROUGH THERE SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS BUT ON THAT. STUDENT UP ON THAT TOUR I WAS REFERENCING RECENTLY. STUDENTS TOLD US TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT IS MOST EFFECTIVE IF THEY HEAR THAT INFORMATION FROM A LOT RELIABLE SOURCES AND AS MANY PLACES AS MANY WAYS AS POSSIBLE SO I JUST THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A MATTER OF. AFFECTED THEM REALLY PERSISTENT OUTREACH TO A LARGE EXTENT AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT OUTREACH- YOUR OUTREACH TO THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE LEAST REPRESENTED IN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS AND INDUSTRIES IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR FACTOR IN THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU AND IF I MAY BE GOING TO CHAIR- I NOTICED THAT FOR TO RUN HEALTH- UNDER YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS THIS IS WERE FOCUSING ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WHAT A WHAT A GREAT IDEA WE WOULD THAT'S ALL WE HEAR ABOUT IS MENTAL HEALTH. AND OF THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH COUNTERS OR DON'T HAVE ENOUGH THERAPIST- BUT TO FOCUS ON THAT. THAT'S IT IT'S BRILLIANT AND I KNOW THAT. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS- IN COLTON WE NOW HAVE THE CAL CAL MAD- WITH ALLIED HEALTH IT DID PROVIDING- TRAINING ALSO. BUT IT ISN'T THE KIND OF TRAINING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THE LEARN AND EARN. MIKE MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HOW CAN WE SHOW THE BENEFITS OF APPRENTICESHIP. TO THE PEOPLE SEEKING THE TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SO WE'VE ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT THE EMPLOYERS HOW DO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE- SHOW THOSE BENEFITS. TO THOSE WHO WOULD BE SEEKING THESE APPRENTICESHIPS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND IT'S REALLY BACK TO THAT STORY TELLING BUT ALSO. WE JUST NEED TO CHANGE OUR MINDSET ABOUT. HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW AGAIN WHEN WE WENT THROUGH COLLEGE. WE DID IT ON A PRAYER AND THEN WE GOT CHIU HANS BUT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND THE WAY WE THOSE SOURCES THE TRUSTED SOURCES IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S NOT JUST. LET'S PUT UP A YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND LET'S LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN THAT ACTUALLY IS IMPORTANT- LETS IT RIP BELIEVE OR NOT A TICK TOCK IS IMPORTANT. BUT BUT I THINK. THE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT'S REALLY SHOWING PEOPLE DOING IT. IN THE COMMUNITY- ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALSO BUILT UP ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE WAS A- IT'S NOW AT SEE YOU APPROVED MICRO CREDENTIAL IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. SO IT'S A SHORTER TRAINING THAT CAN BE DONE ASYNCHRONOUSLY BUT IT COULD BE VALUABLE TO ANYONE WHO IS A- FACULTY MEMBER OR STAFF AT A K. TWELVE. DISTRICT IT COULD BE PROVIDED TO CITY EMPLOYEES OR COUNTY EMPLOYEES AT OUR COMMUNITY GROUPS AND SO- IT'S REALLY KIND OF. DANCE YOUR QUESTION- FROM THE STUDENT SIDE WE HAVEN'T SAID WHAT THE BENEFIT IS IT ISN'T JUST A CREDENTIAL WHAT CAN YOU ACTUALLY DO WITH IT MAYBE HOW CAN YOU MAKE CHANGE. AND EVEN OUR AVERAGE AGES THIRTY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUNGER FOLKS. THEY WANT TO SEE CHANGE RIGHT AND SO WHEN WE CAN SHOW THEM PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THAT CHANGE WITH THESE. CREDENTIALS WE'VE WORKED PARTNERED WITH EDUCATIONAL PROVIDERS TO PRESENT. I THINK IT BECOMES REAL IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOME FAKE JOB SOMEONE ELSE IS DOING- WHEN SOMEONE SO THIS IS THIS WOULD BE FUN TO MAYBE A PROJECT WE CAN HELP YOU WITH FIND THESE FOLKS TO PROFILE IN YOUR REGION AND A PILOT HOW TO SHOW THEIR PATHWAY MANY OF US HAVE COME THROUGH THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE SYSTEM WE CAN ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE COLLEGE'S. HIGHLIGHT THE EMPLOYERS AND THEN MAYBE WE PILOT ANAPPRENTICESHIP- IN THAT AREA IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT AND- FILLED. THANK THAT TELL THE STORY LIKE ISN'T YES I MEAN EVERYONE'S WATCHING THE LATEST. NETFLIX OR APPLE SHOWS. THIS IS IMAGINE- THAT'S MAYBE WE SHOULD GET SOMEBODY IN ENTERTAINMENT. THAT STORY OKAY GOOD ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL TELL YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT. YES ON. I'M A VIETNAM VETERAN THE LAST ONE TO SERVE IN THE ASSEMBLY PROBABLY LAST ONE FOREVER. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE MILITARY I WOULDN'T BE SITTING UP HERE FOR WASN'T FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO MY QUESTION IS. HOW DOES EARN AND LEARN AND ALL THESE PROGRAMS INTERFACE WITH VETERANS AND ALSO THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE ALL THE MONEY SO HOW YOU GET MONEY OUT OF THEM. THAT THAT IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION ARE ARE VETERAN STUDENTS- YOU KNOW IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF. THERE'S A I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PROPER OF THE PROPER META FOR PUBLIC POLICY TERM IS BUT I'M SURE THE TEACHERS IN SOME PUBLIC POLICY CLASS WORK THERE. IS A FAIRLY WIDE IT'S YOU KNOW SORT OF MENU OF BENEFITS IN FUNDING AVAILABLE BUT SUCH A COMPLEX WEB OF BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE AVAILABLE YOU KNOW TO ACCESS TO ACCESS THOSE BENEFITS- WE HAVE STARTED ROLLING OUT VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS A LOT OF OUR CAMPUSES WHICH EFFECTIVELY SERVE AS A ONE STOP SHOP. FOR VETERANS STUDENTS RIGHT THE IDEA BEING WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP SENDING STUDENTS ESPECIALLY AGAIN WITH WITH STUDENTS WERE MILITARY VETERANS- AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS THAT ARE FEDERAL STATE LOCAL PRIVATELY FUNDED HAVE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS HAVE DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND TO BE ABLE TO JUST HAVE THEM GO ONE PLACE ON CAMPUS INSTEAD OF FIVE OR SIX PLACES. IS SO ESSENTIAL TO THAT EXPERIENCE SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING TOWARDS- I KNOW WITH THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF OUR COLLEGES HAVE IN THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS FUNDED IN RECENT YEARS SO WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH BUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. NOT FORCING STUDENTS AGAIN ESPECIALLY STUDENTS FOR VETERANS WHO'VE SERVED AND COURT ELIGIBLE FOR A LOT OF HEAT IN BENEFITS BUT WOULD HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH SO MANY HOOPS TO GET ALL OF THEM NOT FORCING THEM TO JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS I GUESS THE BEST ANALOGY WE BRING THE HOOPS TO THEM A LOT OF JUMP THROUGH ALL OF THEM AT ONCE OR SOMETHING BUT REALLY HAVING A ONE STOP SHOP TYPE MODEL. INCORPORATING EARN AND LEARN A WORKFORCE EDUCATION INTO THAT RIGHT THEY TO SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN ABOUT APPRENTICESHIPS WORKFORCE pTHEY'RE APPLYING FOR THEIR GI BILL OR THEIR OTHER FINANCIALLY BENEFITS IT SHOULD ALL. BE IN ONE PLACE AND ONE LOCATION FOR THE THAT THIRTY MARCH THAT GOING- SORRY MAY I ALSO. REALLY QUICKLY JUST AT A TO THAT I'M GLAD AND I KNOW MANY CAMPUSES HAVE THAT WHICH IS WONDERFUL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE MY DAD SERVED IN THE NAVY AND- I HAVE GREAT GREAT- APPRECIATION FOR OUR SERVICE MEMBERS. I WANT TO SAY THAT IN MY PAST ROLE I HELPED BUILD WITH THE VETERANS TRANSITION CENTER OF CALIFORNIA- WE BUILT UP FACILITIES MANAGEMENT AND HOSPITALITY APPRENTICESHIP PILOT. WITH THREE UP WITH ONE MAJOR EMPLOYER JAIL L. AND BECAUSE OF THAT SERVICES THE VETERANS- TRANSITIONS ARE WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE- TEN APPRENTICES STARTED THAT PROGRAM. AND IT WAS THROUGH THAT- CERTIFICATION THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL FACILITIES MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION. AND JAIL L. CAN. TAKE THESE EMPLOYEES ANYWHERE GLOBALLY AND THAT THE- WELL FUNDS WILL HELP THEM WITH THAT MOVE WHICH MAKES THEM PLAYER MUCH MORE EAGER TO- SUPPORT THE APPRENTICESHIP. AND THIS IS SOMETHING JAIL HAS DONE IN OTHER STATES THIS WAS THE FIRST ONE WE DID IN CALIFORNIA JUST THIS PAST SUMMER. BUT THEY'VE BEEN IN NORTH CAROLINA FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS SO THERE ARE MODELS FOR HOW WE CAN DO THAT WE CERTAINLY COULD DO THAT WITH. SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IN YOUR IN YOUR REGION BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE NEED. AND I ALSO THINK BACK TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS JUST LIKE WITH STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS AND FAMILY THE WHOLE COMMUNITY CAN BENEFIT. WHEN THEY REALIZE THAT THESE ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM SO I JUST WANTED TO. SHARE THAT THAT WEEK WE CAN USE THAT MODEL- BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY HAVE A GREAT IDEA TO TAP INTO THAT. GROUP ONE M. ONE LAST COMMENT- SHORT COMMENT BECAUSE I HAVE AIR TIME WITH YOU FOLKS ESPECIALLY THE CHANCELLOR. I WOULD LIKE TO HOME. REMIND YOU YOU PROBABLY ARE ALREADY AWARE THAT FEMALE VETERANS PER CAPITA HAVE A MUCH HIGHER SUICIDE RATE. THAN THE MALE VETERANS AND TWENTY TWO VETERANS COMMIT SUICIDE EVERY DAY IN AMERICA SO. WHEN YOU'RE DESIGNING PROGRAMS EARN AND LEARN INTERFACING WITH THE VA EXCEPT A- THE FEMALE VETERANS NEEDS SPECIAL ATTENTION AND HELP- BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS THAT. I COULD SPEAK FOR THREE HOURS ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I HAVE THAT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF FOR THE VICE CHANCELLOR. HOW DO YOU KNOW BY CHANCE HOW MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES USE PROGRAMS AND CREDITORS THAT PROHIBIT IRMA EARN AND LEARN. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD NUMBER TO HAVE ON ME BUT I DON'T AT THE MOMENT AS ALL GET OUT WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU TO STOP WITH THAT THAT'S FINE. ALSO MOTIONS ARE WERE BARRIERS ARE THERE TO IMPLEMENTING EARN AND LEARN PROGRAMMES AND WHAT CAN BE DONE AT THE POLICY LEVEL TO ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO OVER. COME THOSE BARRIERS. WELL IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO SAY FUNDING NORTH A FUNDING- YOU KNOW FUNDING FOR THINGS LIKE INCENTIVES. TO NOTE THAT- THAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY ARE OUR COLLEGES ARE DOING A LOT AT THE MOMENT. WE APPRECIATE THAT WE ADMIRE THEM SO MUCH SO I THINK THAT ANY SUPPORT WE CAN GIVE THEM THROUGH THE BUDGET. FOR WHETHER IT'S- AS WELL AS FUNDING FOR INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE BUSINESSES. TO GET INVOLVED I'M BUT THERE MAY ALSO BE YOU KNOW LEGISLATION THAT CAN BE CAN BE PURSUED- I HAVE FOUND IN YOU KNOW MY EXPERIENCE OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT- THE LEGISLATURE. IN ADDITION TO THE YOU KNOW THE SORT OF CLASSIC VAL SHALL HAVE SHALL NOT TYPE STATUTES THE LEGISLATURE ALSO HAS A LOT OF POWER TO SET JUST EXPECTATIONS. RIGHT AND IN THE SYSTEM IS DECENTRALIZED CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THINK- THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE GO A LONG WAY SO. THAT WOULD BE A CONVERSATION I THINK WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU OKAY STOP ON AS TO WHETHER THERE'S SOMETHING. WE CAN HELP PURSUE IS LEGISLATION- TOGETHER IN THAT DIRECTION. YOU CAN'T JUST ADD ON DRUG BURKE CHAIR RODRIGUEZ- IN AGAIN I STATED THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE IS A HUB OF INNOVATION. AND I KNOW IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT. LAUNCH IS THE APPRENTICESHIP HUB. IT'S BASED IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IT'S THE IT'S THE FIRST ONE. THAT REALLY HELPED COLLEGES OPERATIONALIZE APPRENTICESHIPS. SO ANOTHER APPRENTICESHIP THAT WAS BROUGHT OVER FROM ANOTHER REGION. THAT I HELPED WITH WAS A VERY CULTURAL OR IF IT A CULTURE KNOWLEDGE IT WAS BROUGHT FROM SAN DIEGO TO. THE AMOUNTS AND YOU SENT TO COLLEGE BUT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE FACILITATION. OF THE LAUNCH PROGRAM DIRECTOR IS CHARLES HENCKELS BUT THAT'S RIGHT IN YOUR REGION. THAT COULD BE A MODEL BECAUSE I THINK WHAT'S MISSING THIS IS JUST MY OPINION BUT THE OPERAS OPERATIONALIZE THE OPERATIONALIZED I CAN SET YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. OPERATIONALISE LIGHT ISING. OF AT THE COLLEGES OF HOW TO CONNECT. TELL THE STORY STUDENTS EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS THE TRAINING FOR IT TO ACTUALLY FUNCTION AND BE SUSTAINABLE. THAT'S WHAT LAUNCH HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO SO THAT WOULD BE A PERHAPS ANOTHER IDEA TO- MAKE SURE THAT IS HAPPENING IN EACH REGION SO THAT THERE IS A HUB FOR THE- FACILITATION OF CONTENT SHARING AND ACTUAL OUTCOMES. OKAY GREAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO WITHOUT I GUESS WE STILL HAVE SOME TIME LEFT OVER COMING UP ON THE HOUR FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME STAKEHOLDERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN PERSON AND ON THE LINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

THIS INCLUDES A FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND THE SKILLED TRADES.

CLASSROOM TRAINING FOLLOWED BY FOUR MONTHS PAID WORK EXPERIENCE AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. THESE GRADUATES GO FROM A RELIANCE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE INTO JOBS ON AVERAGE EARNING TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. THESE GRADUATES TELL US HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE EARNING A WAGE NOT ONLY TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. BUT ALSO TO PAY OFF DEBTS THAT HELP THEM BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY. AND ALSO TO FEEL LIKE REAL EMPLOYEES I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES WE HEAR THIS OVER AN HOUR. OVER IT TO BE TREATED LIKE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOMETHING OF VALUE TO OFFER IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.

AND MANY OF THESE APPLICANTS COME FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ENTER INTO GOOD CAREER THROUGH OTHER ROUTES. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOTIVATED THEIR FACT REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE POPULATION. AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF TAKING TIME OFF WITHOUT AN INCOME. WELL THE BUILD SKILLS AND GROW IN THEIR CAREERS. THESE PEOPLE HUGELY BENEFIT FROM EARNING LEARN MODELS THE INCOME THEY EARN WHILE TRAINING FOR THEIR NEW AREERS ALLOWS THEM TO CONTINUE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES THEIR CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES. KEEP THEM FOCUSED ON THEIR GOALS ALLOWS THEM TO LEARN EFFECTIVELY AND GIVES THEM THE DIGNITY OF BEING PAID FOR THEIR HARD WORK AS THEY GAIN SKILLS.
