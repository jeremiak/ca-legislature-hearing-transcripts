BEEN REAUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS AT

00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:04.857 region:rollup2
THE TIME. THE CURRENT BUDGET

00:17:02.822 --> 00:17:06.626 region:rollup2
HAD.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:08.461 region:rollup2
CHOSEN A MIDDLE ROAD APPROACH

00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:10.630 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS WE ASSUME THAT THE.

00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:12.064 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WOULD BE REAUTHORIZED

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.934 region:rollup2
WE WERE NOT I'M THINKING THAT

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:17.136 region:rollup2
pEIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT MATCHING

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:18.070 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND SO WE WENT BACK DOWN

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:19.405 region:rollup2
TO THE SIXTY THE MORE

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.907 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL SIXTY FIVE PERCENT

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:22.408 region:rollup2
MATCHING LEVEL AND THEN.

00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:22.975 region:rollup2
CONGRESS DID FINALLY

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:24.176 region:rollup2
REAUTHORIZE THE PROGRAM BUT

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:25.778 region:rollup2
THEY.

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:27.046 region:rollup2
DID IT AT THE EIGHTY EIGHT SO

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:28.281 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE AN ADJUSTMENT IN

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.783 region:rollup2
THE MAY REVISION I'M TO

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:31.417 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE FOR THAT THAT CHANGE

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:33.920 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS MADE TOO LATE FOR US

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:35.154 region:rollup2
TO. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.923 region:rollup2
WERE DOING THE BUDGET.

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:38.457 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ITEM THAT I'M SURE WE

00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:40.259 region:rollup2
WILL SPEAK OUT AT A FURTHER

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:41.594 region:rollup2
HEARING IS WE'RE PROPOSING TO

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.261 region:rollup2
MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE THREE

00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:43.963 region:rollup2
FORTY.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:45.564 region:rollup2
BE DRUG.

00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:47.667 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:49.068 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME INCREASING

00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:50.736 region:rollup2
CONCERNS BOTH AT A STAY AT A

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:52.171 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LEVEL AS TO HOW THIS

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.139 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS.

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:54.707 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED.

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:56.509 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT NATURE OF THE

00:17:54.707 --> 00:17:57.643 region:rollup2
REBATES AND THOUGH WAY THAT

00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:59.378 region:rollup2
THOSE DRUGS ARE PRICED AND

00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:00.713 region:rollup2
DISCOUNTED IS THAT.

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:02.048 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:03.582 region:rollup2
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THOSE

00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:05.051 region:rollup2
REBATES ARE EITHER ACCOUNTED FOR

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:06.786 region:rollup2
NOT IN BOTH FEE FOR SERVICE AND

00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:08.120 region:rollup2
IN MANAGED CARE AND SO WE HAVE A

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:09.855 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.123 region:rollup2
TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF THOSE

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:12.792 region:rollup2
DRUGS FOR PURPOSES OF THE

00:18:11.123 --> 00:18:14.260 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PROGRAM. THEY WOULD

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:15.561 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY STILL BE ABLE TO BE

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.663 region:rollup2
USED IN DISPENSED FOR OTHER

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:17.930 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS BUT JUST NOT FOR

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:21.334 region:rollup2
MEDICAID.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:23.002 region:rollup2
THERE ARE AND SMALLER CHANGES

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:25.004 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO INCREASE

00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:28.140 region:rollup2
OUR ADMINISTRATIVE CAP.

00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:29.375 region:rollup2
WITH THE AND AS WE HELP SUPPORT

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.676 region:rollup2
AT THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY AROUND

00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:32.945 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE HOSPITAL QUALITY

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:33.646 region:rollup2
ASSURANCE FEE. IN WHICH WE WOULD

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.581 region:rollup2
BE SEEKING TO.

00:18:33.646 --> 00:18:37.850 region:rollup2
FUND ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:39.852 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES AND THEN WE ARE ALSO

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.420 region:rollup2
PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:42.755 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM THAT WAS ENACTED

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.490 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS AGO BACK IN TWO

00:18:42.755 --> 00:18:46.492 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND SIX AND.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.660 region:rollup2
BOTH FROM A LENGTH OF TIME IN

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:48.694 region:rollup2
WHICH IT TOOK US TO GET IT

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.062 region:rollup2
APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:51.831 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AND IN WORKING WITH

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:53.532 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC FREE SPENDING.

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:54.333 region:rollup2
NON HOSPITAL BASED CLINICS

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:56.469 region:rollup2
THERE WAS.

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:58.270 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY NO TAKERS FOR THIS

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.372 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND SO WE'RE PROPOSING

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.374 region:rollup2
TO REPEAL THAT.

00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:02.842 region:rollup2
.

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:03.809 region:rollup2
FOR PURPOSES OF THE MEDI CAL

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:06.212 region:rollup2
ESTA MEANT.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:08.614 region:rollup2
AS YOU HAVE NOTED IN YOUR

00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:09.982 region:rollup2
AGENDA CASELOAD HAS REMAINED

00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:12.051 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY FLAT.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:13.953 region:rollup2
FOR A VARIETY OF.

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:15.955 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR WHICH WE WERE NOT

00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:16.355 region:rollup2
QUITE I'M SURE BUT WE THINK THAT

00:19:15.955 --> 00:19:19.191 region:rollup2
THE.

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:20.993 region:rollup2
VERY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:22.128 region:rollup2
INCREASING ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.295 region:rollup2
HAS CERTAINLY LED TO A

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:25.865 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:27.233 region:rollup2
TAPER IN FAMILY AND CHILDREN

00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:28.401 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM IN

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:29.935 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THOSE ELIGIBILITY

00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:31.270 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES BUT WE'RE STILL SEEN

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.972 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN THE OPTIONAL

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.674 region:rollup2
EXPANSION. AS WELL AS IN THE

00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:36.776 region:rollup2
SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.476 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES CATEGORY.

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:39.245 region:rollup2
AND.

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:40.946 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IN

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:42.915 region:rollup2
TERMS OF MAJOR POLICY CHANGES.

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:44.650 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE ESTIMATE.

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:46.886 region:rollup2
RELATES TOWARD DRUG MEDI CAL

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.888 region:rollup2
ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM WAIVER

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:50.923 region:rollup2
SO JUST A QUICK REMINDER THIS IS

00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:52.625 region:rollup2
A VOLUNTARY WAIVER THAT ARE

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:53.726 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE WORKING ON WITH US.

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:56.362 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT A.

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:57.830 region:rollup2
CONTINUUM OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:19:56.362 --> 00:20:00.399 region:rollup2

WE HAVE.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.004 region:rollup2
TEN COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:06.706 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING WE ANTICIPATE

00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:12.945 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.580 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS THAT

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.817 region:rollup2
WILL BE.

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:19.351 region:rollup2
DRAWN DOWN AND USE TO PROVIDE

PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE LIMITED

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:21.280 region:rollup2
THAT CALCULATION TO

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:22.348 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY TWO BILLION OF THE

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.150 region:rollup2

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.620 region:rollup2
SO TO LOOK AT THE REPORT

00:21:26.352 --> 00:21:29.889 region:rollup2
CALCULATION ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF

YOUR GENDER.

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:32.825 region:rollup2
THE FIRST LINE SHOWS YOU ARE

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.326 region:rollup2
REVENUES WITHOUT PROPOSITION

00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:36.195 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE.

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:37.296 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU WERE CURIOUS BUT THE

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:38.697 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF THE PROPOSITION FIVE

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.398 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL REVENUES ARE THAT IS

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:42.535 region:rollup2
ON YOUR.

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:43.469 region:rollup2
ON THE WORKSHEET ONLINE FOR.

AND THE REASON YOU HAVE A LOWER

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:46.205 region:rollup2
AMOUNT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:47.206 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PROPOSITION THIRTY WENT

00:21:46.205 --> 00:21:49.074 region:rollup2
THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY

00:21:47.206 --> 00:21:50.743 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN SO THAT FISCAL YEAR.

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:52.745 region:rollup2
HAS THE ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS.

00:21:50.743 --> 00:21:54.713 region:rollup2
.

00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:56.215 region:rollup2
THE REVENUES TOGETHER ARE

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.983 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY WE DO

00:21:56.215 --> 00:21:59.418 region:rollup2
OUR PROJECT ESTIMATES.

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:00.085 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE ARE MULTI YOUR

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:01.687 region:rollup2
REVIEW.

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:04.523 region:rollup2
THOSE REVENUE DOLLARS ALSO TAKE

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:06.125 region:rollup2
INTO ACCOUNT TRANSFERS AND SO.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:07.927 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:08.994 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT TRANSFERS THE REQUIRED

00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:10.563 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS ANY SUBLIMINAL

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:11.931 region:rollup2
DEPOSITS WOULD BE PART OF THAT

00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:14.066 region:rollup2
CALCULATION.

00:22:11.931 --> 00:22:15.801 region:rollup2
SO THAT WILL BE A POINT OF

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:17.436 region:rollup2
CONTENTION LATER AND SO I'M

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:19.872 region:rollup2
GONNA HOLD THE COMMENT BUT PUT A

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:22.274 region:rollup2
MARKER THERE IF YOU CAN ABOUT.

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:24.143 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE FORCED AND OBLIGATED

00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:24.710 region:rollup2
TO DO AND WHAT WE CHOOSE TO DO

00:22:24.143 --> 00:22:28.681 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARILY? IN ADDITION TO

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:30.683 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:32.318 region:rollup2
THE NEXT LINE IS A LITTLE MORE

00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:33.652 region:rollup2
STRAIGHTFORWARD PROPOSITION

00:22:32.318 --> 00:22:34.887 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS THAT IS

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:36.555 region:rollup2
THEM THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL

00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:38.057 region:rollup2
CALCULATION SO.

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:40.259 region:rollup2
I THINK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:41.861 region:rollup2
OFFICE WILL ALSO CLARIFY WHETHER

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:42.461 region:rollup2
IT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES

00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:43.329 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN THE

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:45.431 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL MINIMUM THIS

00:22:43.329 --> 00:22:46.532 region:rollup2
CALCULATION LOOKS AT WHAT THAT

00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:49.068 region:rollup2
FORMULA WOULD BE.

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:50.135 region:rollup2
FOR THE NINE NINETY WORKLOAD OF.

00:22:49.068 --> 00:22:52.204 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PROGRAMS ARE LOOKED AT

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:53.606 region:rollup2
ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS SO MOST

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:55.307 region:rollup2
OF THE BUDGET IS DEVELOPED.

00:22:53.606 --> 00:22:56.842 region:rollup2
.

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:58.143 region:rollup2
HELLO A CASELOAD ESTIMATES

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:59.845 region:rollup2
REQUIRED ESTIMATES.

00:22:58.143 --> 00:23:00.913 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:02.114 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE FOR THE EIGHTEEN

00:23:00.913 --> 00:23:03.115 region:rollup2
NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:04.216 region:rollup2
CONSIDER CURRENT CURRENTLY

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:08.287 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED SERVICES.

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:09.154 region:rollup2
.

00:23:08.287 --> 00:23:10.656 region:rollup2
AND THEN AS YOU SEE THE

00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:10.889 region:rollup2
COMPARISON OF LINE FOR WITH

00:23:10.656 --> 00:23:12.625 region:rollup2
FLYING.

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:13.892 region:rollup2
.

00:23:12.625 --> 00:23:16.395 region:rollup2
I ONLINE FIVE WE SHOW THAT THE

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:17.730 region:rollup2
REVENUES ABSENT PROP FIFTY FIVE

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:19.531 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.200 region:rollup2
THE WORKLOAD ESTIMATE. SO.

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:22.201 region:rollup2
ASSUMING ALL OF THE PROPOSITION

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.869 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS THERE WOULD

00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:24.937 region:rollup2
STILL BE ABOUT ONE POINT NINE

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:26.272 region:rollup2
BILLION IN NEED.

00:23:24.937 --> 00:23:27.106 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE

00:23:26.272 --> 00:23:29.008 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT

00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:30.643 region:rollup2
ASSUME. ANY P. DOLLARS GOING TO

00:23:29.008 --> 00:23:32.111 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL FUNDING.

00:23:30.643 --> 00:23:34.480 region:rollup2
OF ONE CAVEAT I WANTED TO KNOW

00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:35.648 region:rollup2

PROPOSED

00:23:37.049 --> 00:23:39.251 region:rollup2
SO ANY CHANGES IN EIGHTEEN

00:23:38.317 --> 00:23:40.686 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WOULD AFFECT THOSE ARE

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:42.288 region:rollup2
YOURS.

00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:43.822 region:rollup2

JANUARY BUDGET PRETTY MAY REVISE

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:52.598 region:rollup2
AND IS THERE OPPORTUNITIES THAT

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:54.400 region:rollup2
MAY REVISED. RE EVALUATE SOME OF

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:55.100 region:rollup2
THE CALCULATION.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.968 region:rollup2
THIS WILL BE UPDATED AGAIN

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.670 region:rollup2
AMERICA SHOULD AND WILL BE

SEE IF THAT STEMS FURTHER

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:12.618 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.285 region:rollup2
THANK YOU TERRY MEMBERS AND

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:14.753 region:rollup2
HOLLINGS HAD FINALLY JUST LET OF

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.521 region:rollup2
ANALYST'S OFFICE SO I JUST BE

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:17.289 region:rollup2
SPEAKING.

00:24:15.521 --> 00:24:19.391 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY FROM A REPORT THAT OUR

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:20.959 region:rollup2
OFFICE ISSUED A FEW DAYS AGO ON

00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:22.328 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:24.830 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES BY THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:24:22.328 --> 00:24:26.699 region:rollup2
LET ME JUST.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.033 region:rollup2
US TO GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL.

00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:29.535 region:rollup2
CONTEXT FOR MY REMARKS A MINUTE.

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:30.736 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY PUT A LITTLE CONTEXT

00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:32.071 region:rollup2
AROUND THE NUMBERS THE

00:24:30.736 --> 00:24:33.372 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST GAVE

00:24:32.071 --> 00:24:34.940 region:rollup2
YOU WALK THROUGH HALL THE

00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:36.709 region:rollup2
CALCULATION WORKS UP FROM THE

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.610 region:rollup2
MEASURES PERSPECTIVE. AND NOT

00:24:36.709 --> 00:24:39.978 region:rollup2
GIVE YOUR OFFICES TWO COMMENTS.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.880 region:rollup2
ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:44.183 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION SO JUST TURNING

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.385 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE ONE ON THE FIRST PAGE

00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:47.653 region:rollup2
THIS OUTLINES I IN GENERAL HOW

00:24:46.385 --> 00:24:49.121 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE SAYS THAT THE

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:50.723 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE

00:24:49.121 --> 00:24:52.057 region:rollup2
POPULATION SHOULD WORK.

00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:53.125 region:rollup2
SO IT DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:54.960 region:rollup2
FINANCE TO BEGIN WITH AN

00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:56.929 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE OF AVAILABLE GENERAL

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.396 region:rollup2
FUND REVENUES AS HAS JUST BEEN

00:24:56.929 --> 00:24:59.598 region:rollup2
NOTED.

00:24:57.396 --> 00:25:02.134 region:rollup2
THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF BOTH THE

00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:02.534 region:rollup2
OPTIONAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL BSA

00:25:02.134 --> 00:25:02.968 region:rollup2
DEPOSITS UNDER THE

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:05.304 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S LA

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:06.038 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS.

00:25:05.304 --> 00:25:07.373 region:rollup2
THEN.

00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:08.640 region:rollup2
WE SUBTRACT FROM THAT AS IT

00:25:07.373 --> 00:25:09.842 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION NOTED THE MINIMUM

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.410 region:rollup2
FUNDING GUARANTEE AND THEN WE

00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:12.578 region:rollup2
SUBTRACT FROM THAT THE WORKLOAD

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.779 region:rollup2
BUDGET. NOW THERE'S NOT

00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:14.913 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY A STRAIGHTFORWARD

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:16.548 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION HERE FOR WHAT THE

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:18.250 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD BUDGET IS BUT AS IT IS

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:20.052 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED IN THE MEASURE. IT IS

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.587 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET YOUR COST IN TWENTY

00:25:20.052 --> 00:25:23.288 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OF PROVIDING

00:25:21.587 --> 00:25:26.024 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT WERE AUTHORIZED ON

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:27.526 region:rollup2
JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:28.994 region:rollup2
IN THE MEASURE SPECIFICALLY

00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:30.429 region:rollup2
OTHER DEPARTMENT FINANCES TO

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:31.997 region:rollup2
TAKE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:34.099 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND THEN UPDATED FOR A

00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:35.701 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF CHANGES INCLUDING

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:37.169 region:rollup2
CASELOAD PRICE INCREASES.

00:25:35.701 --> 00:25:38.437 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS CHANGES THAT WOULD

00:25:37.169 --> 00:25:40.139 region:rollup2
BE OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:25:38.437 --> 00:25:41.106 region:rollup2
CONTROL LIKE FEDERAL IN COURT

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:43.108 region:rollup2
MANDATES.

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:44.843 region:rollup2
SO.

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:46.345 region:rollup2
AS A DEPARTMENT FINANCES NOTED.

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:47.679 region:rollup2
THERE'S A DEFICIT IN THEIR

00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:49.214 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD BUDGET CALCULATION WE

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:51.150 region:rollup2
JUST SHOW A SIMPLE SIMPLIFIED

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:53.886 region:rollup2
VERSION OF FAT I'M AT THE TOP OF

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.520 region:rollup2
PAGE TWO.

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:57.589 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.158 region:rollup2
IN OUR ESTIMATE TWO REASONS.

00:25:57.589 --> 00:26:00.993 region:rollup2
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:25:59.158 --> 00:26:02.694 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIES A DEFICIT IN ITS

00:26:00.993 --> 00:26:04.430 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD BUDGET CALCULATION THE

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:06.131 region:rollup2
FIRST IS RELATED TO THAT

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.067 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE REVENUES PIECE. AND

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:10.369 region:rollup2
THE SECOND IS RELATED TO THE

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:13.005 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD BUDGET CALCULATION.

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:14.740 region:rollup2
AS WAS NOTED ON AVAILABLE

00:26:13.005 --> 00:26:15.841 region:rollup2
REVENUES. THERE'S AN ARGUMENT

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.643 region:rollup2
THAT WHILE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:26:15.841 --> 00:26:18.677 region:rollup2
DEPOSITS SHOULD BE COUNTED SORT

00:26:17.643 --> 00:26:20.345 region:rollup2
OF IN THE NORMAL BUDGETARY SONS

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:20.846 region:rollup2
AS A NEGATIVE A NEGATIVE

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.114 region:rollup2
TRANSFER FROM AVAILABLE

00:26:20.846 --> 00:26:24.249 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

00:26:22.114 --> 00:26:26.585 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT THE

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:29.254 region:rollup2
OPTIONAL DEPOSIT INTO THE BSA

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:30.355 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED THIS WAY.

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:32.024 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES I'M

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:33.592 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION ABOUT ESTIMATE AS

00:26:32.024 --> 00:26:35.194 region:rollup2
A RESULT WOULD SLIGHTLY INCREASE

00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:36.395 region:rollup2
ARTS I WOULD SLIGHTLY DECREASE

00:26:35.194 --> 00:26:37.763 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE REVENUES

00:26:36.395 --> 00:26:39.565 region:rollup2
AND THEREFOREI REDUCE THE

00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:40.933 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL SURPLUS

00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:41.400 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR MEDI CAL.

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:43.402 region:rollup2
SO.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.170 region:rollup2
OUR SECOND COMMENT IS REGARDING

00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:47.806 region:rollup2
THE WORKLOAD BUDGET CALCULATION.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:49.708 region:rollup2
BICU.

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:51.910 region:rollup2
THE REPORT OF FINANCE TAKES A

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:53.412 region:rollup2
VERY BROAD INTERPRETATION OF THE

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.379 region:rollup2
PHRASE CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED

00:26:53.412 --> 00:26:56.215 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:56.849 region:rollup2
AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I MEAN BY

00:26:56.215 --> 00:26:59.017 region:rollup2
THAT THE INTER.

00:26:56.849 --> 00:27:00.519 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:01.954 region:rollup2
COUNTS ANY SERVICE THAT WAS IN

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:04.389 region:rollup2
PLACE ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:05.657 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN. OF ANY GENERAL TYPE AS

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:07.593 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY AUTHORIZE EVEN IF A

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:09.061 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC BENEFIT OR PROGRAMMER

00:27:07.593 --> 00:27:10.162 region:rollup2
SERVICE WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT

00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:12.030 region:rollup2
THAT TIME.

00:27:10.162 --> 00:27:13.065 region:rollup2
SO LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN THE

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.199 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET

00:27:13.065 --> 00:27:15.701 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:17.970 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY CHILDCARE BRIDGE

00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:19.938 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OF THIS PROVIDED A MEDIA

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.773 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE ACCESS TO FOSTER

00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:23.275 region:rollup2
FAMILIES ON FOSTER PARENTS. NOW

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:24.810 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION COUNTS THAT

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:25.911 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THE WORKLOAD BUDGET

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.880 region:rollup2
UNDER THE RATIONALE THAT THE

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:29.581 region:rollup2
STATE HAS LONG PROVIDED FOSTER

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.116 region:rollup2
CARE SERVICES AND ASSOCIATED

00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:33.552 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR FOSTER FAMILIES.

00:33:35.547 --> 00:33:39.584 region:rollup2
REMAIN. AND THE REVENUES THE

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:41.019 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:41.987 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE REVENUES.

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.989 region:rollup2
INCLUDES THE REVENUES IN

00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:45.056 region:rollup2
TRANSFERS SO AT WHATEVER LEVEL

00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:46.691 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO DO

00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:48.927 region:rollup2
ABOVE THE REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:51.796 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS CALCULATION AND YET

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:53.265 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE. PUT UP PLACE MARKER IN

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:56.134 region:rollup2
THERE THAT THEN PROHIBITS

00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:56.701 region:rollup2
FUND'S THAT SHOULD BE GOING IN.

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:59.170 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS MIND TOWARDS MEDI

00:33:56.701 --> 00:34:01.406 region:rollup2
CAL.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:04.009 region:rollup2
HOW HAVE YOU MADE THAT

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:07.178 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION AND WHY ARE WE

00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:09.047 region:rollup2
THEN IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE

00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:10.115 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO HAVE THOSE FUNDS?

00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:12.017 region:rollup2
TO HELP.

00:34:10.115 --> 00:34:13.985 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS THAT NEED. THE

00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:15.620 region:rollup2
MOST IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:17.122 region:rollup2
OVERALL GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.990 region:rollup2
WERE LOOKING TO SET ASIDE

00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:20.458 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR. THAT THE

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:21.293 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL DOWNTURN WHERE WE

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:23.261 region:rollup2
NOTED THAT THE.

00:34:21.293 --> 00:34:24.629 region:rollup2
AS AT THE END OF EIGHTEEN

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:26.464 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WE WOULD BE.

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:28.800 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME.

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:30.669 region:rollup2
EXTENDED THE ORB THE LENGTHIEST.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.837 region:rollup2
OF RECOVERY PERIOD IN THE ITS

00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:34.839 region:rollup2
POST WORLD WAR HISTORY SO PART

00:34:32.837 --> 00:34:36.107 region:rollup2
OF THE PROPOSAL WAS MAKING SURE

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:38.777 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH CERTIFIED

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:40.512 region:rollup2
IN RESERVES NO I'M NOT A.

00:34:38.777 --> 00:34:42.180 region:rollup2
I THINK OUR STRUGGLE IS YOUR

00:34:40.512 --> 00:34:44.082 region:rollup2
BUDGET CALCULATION.

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:46.284 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT BY TAKING IT AS A

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:48.520 region:rollup2
TRANSFER BY CREATING A NEGATIVE

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:50.422 region:rollup2
BALANCE.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.091 region:rollup2
YOUR CREATING A GIMMICK. IN

00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:55.026 region:rollup2
BUDGET PARLANCE THAT ACTUALLY.

00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:58.630 region:rollup2
IS TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY FOR

00:34:55.026 --> 00:35:00.298 region:rollup2
US TO HAVE A REAL SURPLUS AND TO

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.534 region:rollup2
REPRESENT THE VOTER'S INTENT

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:04.936 region:rollup2
TIGHT STRUGGLE. TO UNDERSTAND

00:35:02.534 --> 00:35:05.904 region:rollup2
HOW. THIS WAS WHAT THE VOTERS

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:08.974 region:rollup2
VOTED ON.

00:35:05.904 --> 00:35:11.610 region:rollup2
LAST FOR US. CREATE SPREADSHEETS

00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:13.979 region:rollup2
THAT TOOK AWAY THEIR INTENT.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:15.046 region:rollup2
I'LL TRADE AND OF A DIFFERENT

00:35:13.979 --> 00:35:15.246 region:rollup2
WAY OF IT BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:17.649 region:rollup2
SAY.

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:19.851 region:rollup2
THE CLARIFICATION IS MORE OF

00:35:17.649 --> 00:35:21.453 region:rollup2
WHAT THE INTENT DOES AS OF JUNE

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:23.021 region:rollup2
THIRTIETH AND SO AS OF JUNE.

00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:24.356 region:rollup2
BY JUNE THIRTIETH IF THE

00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:25.924 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS CHOSEN TO DO A

00:35:24.356 --> 00:35:27.425 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL SO OUR PROPOSAL

00:35:25.924 --> 00:35:28.626 region:rollup2
INCLUDED THAT ASSUMPTION.

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:30.028 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE DOES IT

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:32.530 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AS OF THE JUNE

00:35:30.028 --> 00:35:34.032 region:rollup2
THIRTIETH SO IT'S MORE OF A.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.866 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL IS TO INCLUDE THAT

00:35:34.032 --> 00:35:36.267 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:36.835 region:rollup2
SOMETHING DIFFERENT BEFORE JUNE

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:41.072 region:rollup2
THIRTIETH THAT WOULD BE THAT

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:41.339 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE.

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:45.944 region:rollup2
YEAH I'M.

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:47.712 region:rollup2
.

00:35:45.944 --> 00:35:48.380 region:rollup2
WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN.

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:50.081 region:rollup2
EQUIVOCAL TO.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.250 region:rollup2
.

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:53.718 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE SUBTRACTED IT IN THE

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.153 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE WAY THAT THE LA O. HAS

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:57.722 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED.

00:35:55.153 --> 00:36:00.225 region:rollup2
AS A FASHION FOR US TO GET AN

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:03.028 region:rollup2
ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF WHAT.

00:36:00.225 --> 00:36:04.429 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN.

00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:05.597 region:rollup2
CLUE DID TO REPRESENT THE

00:36:04.429 --> 00:36:06.798 region:rollup2
VOTER'S INTENT AGAIN I'M

00:36:05.597 --> 00:36:09.401 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING TO.

00:36:06.798 --> 00:36:11.169 region:rollup2
FEEL AS IF THIS IS A ONE SIDED

00:36:09.401 --> 00:36:12.237 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND I UNDERSTAND

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:14.072 region:rollup2
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:36:12.237 --> 00:36:16.207 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY HAS.

00:36:14.072 --> 00:36:17.542 region:rollup2
QUITE AN ABILITY TO DETERMINE

00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:19.511 region:rollup2
WHAT IS WITHIN OUR WORKLOAD

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:21.179 region:rollup2
BUDGET. BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:22.814 region:rollup2
THE PRECEDENT THAT'S BEING SET

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:24.916 region:rollup2
ABOUT OPTIONAL PAYMENTS OUTSIDE

00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:26.384 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WAS MANDATED BY

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:28.420 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO. AND I'M

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:29.487 region:rollup2
WONDERING HOW WE DECIDED UPON

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.989 region:rollup2
THE THREE AND A HALF BILLION HOW

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:33.124 region:rollup2
WE.

00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:35.193 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO BE FAIR IS

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:35.727 region:rollup2
IF WE WANTED TO FILL UP THE

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:38.063 region:rollup2
PIGGY BANK AND CREATES THE

00:36:35.727 --> 00:36:40.432 region:rollup2
OPTIC.

00:36:38.063 --> 00:36:43.702 region:rollup2
AND YET IS THAT WHAT VOTERS

00:36:40.432 --> 00:36:45.570 region:rollup2
INTENDED FOR US TO DO. OR WHEN

00:36:43.702 --> 00:36:47.372 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:49.107 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WORTH OF SURPLUS THAT

00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:51.776 region:rollup2
WILL ACTUALLY INVESTED INTO MEDI

00:36:49.107 --> 00:36:52.977 region:rollup2
CAL AS INTENDED BY THE VOTERS.

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:54.512 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS AS IF WE ARE.

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:56.281 region:rollup2
CREATING.

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:58.716 region:rollup2
THIS BUDGET.

00:36:56.281 --> 00:37:01.319 region:rollup2
DEFICIT ON PAPER.

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:02.587 region:rollup2
SO AS TO NOT FUND MEDI CAL CAN

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:04.189 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:05.724 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES. READING

00:37:04.189 --> 00:37:08.460 region:rollup2
OF

00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:08.960 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSITION AND AS IT

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.829 region:rollup2
SETTING PRECEDENTS GOING

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.431 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:14.899 region:rollup2
AND WE WERE LOOKING AT MORE OF

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:16.768 region:rollup2
THE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.869 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT SO ACROSS MULTIPLE

00:37:16.768 --> 00:37:21.439 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS.

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:23.241 region:rollup2
SO. IF MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:25.844 region:rollup2
ASSUME TRANSFERS IN THE REVENUE

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:27.679 region:rollup2
NUMBER IT'S THE SAME FORECAST

00:37:25.844 --> 00:37:28.379 region:rollup2
HERE THE REVENUE NUMBERS ASSUME

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:30.248 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSFER.

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:32.350 region:rollup2
.

00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:35.754 region:rollup2
BUT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WAS

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:38.723 region:rollup2
MANDATED AT THE MINIMUM AMOUNT.

00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:39.824 region:rollup2
TO GO AND. WHY ARE WE NOT DOING

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:42.160 region:rollup2
AND BEING CONSISTENT WITH

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:44.762 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO TO PLACE THE

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.664 region:rollup2
MINIMUM TRANSFER AMOUNT TEN WHY

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:49.534 region:rollup2
DO WE INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL?

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:51.369 region:rollup2
OPTIONAL INCREASES ABOVE.

00:37:49.534 --> 00:37:52.470 region:rollup2
WHAT? IS HAPPENING IN PROP

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:54.172 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT FOR US TO BE

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.440 region:rollup2
CONSISTANT SHOULDN'T WE MIRROR

00:37:54.172 --> 00:37:56.875 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE DOING AND PROP NINETY

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.343 region:rollup2
EIGHT AS WE SHOULD DO AND PROP

00:37:56.875 --> 00:38:00.378 region:rollup2
TWO.

00:37:58.343 --> 00:38:02.347 region:rollup2
I I THINK IT'S AN ORDER OF

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:03.281 region:rollup2
EVENTS THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE

00:38:02.347 --> 00:38:05.216 region:rollup2
CONFUSING BUT.

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:06.684 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE DOING THE

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:08.520 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY A GUARANTEE

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:09.854 region:rollup2
THAT DODD GENERAL FUND REVENUE

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.189 region:rollup2
NUMBER ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:13.024 region:rollup2
TRANSFERS OVERALL.

00:38:11.189 --> 00:38:15.393 region:rollup2
THESE TO BE INCLUDED IN THEIR

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:17.962 region:rollup2
EYES AS THE THE EPA DOLLARS.

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:20.932 region:rollup2
IN GENERAL BUT THEIR PROPERTY

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:21.533 region:rollup2
FIVE IS THE LAST CALCULATION AND

00:38:20.932 --> 00:38:25.603 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS AT WHAT THAT FINAL.

00:38:21.533 --> 00:38:27.605 region:rollup2
PACKAGES.

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:28.540 region:rollup2
I AM STILL.

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:30.642 region:rollup2
I'M NOT FEELING LIKE.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:32.644 region:rollup2
.

00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:34.245 region:rollup2
I'M UNDERSTANDING HOW WE WERE

00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:35.713 region:rollup2
ABLE TO INCLUDE THE THREE AND A

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:37.949 region:rollup2
HALF BILLION.

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:39.918 region:rollup2
DAHLE ARE OPTIONAL PAYMENT

00:38:37.949 --> 00:38:42.287 region:rollup2
TO TAKE IT OFF THE TOP AND NOT

00:38:39.918 --> 00:38:44.189 region:rollup2
INCLUDE IT INTO THIS PROPOSITION

00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:45.423 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE ESTIMATES AND REALLY

00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:47.425 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE A BETTER

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:50.328 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF. WHERE THAT

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:52.297 region:rollup2
STATUTORY AUTHORITY CAME FROM?

00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:54.265 region:rollup2
AND HOW. WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE

00:38:52.297 --> 00:38:55.834 region:rollup2
THOSE ASSUMPTIONS.

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:57.168 region:rollup2
SO THEY AUTHORITY WILL COME WHEN

00:38:55.834 --> 00:38:58.836 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES A

00:38:57.168 --> 00:39:00.138 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSIT SO THE

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:02.040 region:rollup2
REQUIRED AMOUNT YOU CRACKED IS.

00:39:00.138 --> 00:39:02.540 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE CONSTITUTION

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.775 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY PROVIDES THAT.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.177 region:rollup2
.

00:39:03.775 --> 00:39:06.778 region:rollup2
WHEN OUR SUCTION WAS THAT THIS

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:08.146 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE LEGISLATURE'S UP

00:39:06.778 --> 00:39:10.281 region:rollup2
OF.

00:39:08.146 --> 00:39:11.816 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION AND THE AMOUNT

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:12.984 region:rollup2
YOU'RE CORRECT WAS DETERMINED AS

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:14.552 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD GET US TO

00:39:12.984 --> 00:39:15.854 region:rollup2
THE TEN PERCENT CONSTITUTIONAL

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:17.822 region:rollup2
TARGET AND I SEE THE REAL

00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:20.024 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF DOING WHAT YOU'RE

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:22.227 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING. BUT IN TERMS OF US

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:23.461 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE SETTING

00:39:22.227 --> 00:39:24.829 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE PRECEDENT I WANT

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:26.364 region:rollup2
THE CALCULATION THE PROCESS

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:28.266 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:31.002 region:rollup2
AND I'M STRUGGLING TO FEEL LIKE

00:39:28.266 --> 00:39:32.704 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE RIGHT PROCESS.

00:39:31.002 --> 00:39:34.572 region:rollup2
WHEN IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GETTING

00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:36.841 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF OURSELVES BEFORE THE

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:38.109 region:rollup2
JUNE BUDGET IN SO. I'M ACTUALLY

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:40.311 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF THE APPROPRIATE

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:42.347 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS TO SET WHAT WE HAVE

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:43.748 region:rollup2
IN FRONT OF US TODAY TO DO WHAT

00:39:42.347 --> 00:39:45.650 region:rollup2
THE MINIMUM IS WITH AND

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:47.518 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO IN TERMS OF

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.654 region:rollup2
CREATING OUR BUDGET. AND THEN TO

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:51.923 region:rollup2
DO WHAT WE NEED TO COME JUNE

00:39:49.654 --> 00:39:54.392 region:rollup2
THIRTIETH TO ENSURE THAT WERE

00:39:51.923 --> 00:39:56.327 region:rollup2
PREPARING FOR TOMORROW. I'M JUST

00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:57.729 region:rollup2
FEELING AS IF.

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:59.931 region:rollup2
WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS

00:39:57.729 --> 00:40:01.532 region:rollup2
PRESENTING IS A WAY FOR US NOT

00:39:59.931 --> 00:40:03.901 region:rollup2
THAT?

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:05.737 region:rollup2
TRULY REFLECT VOTER INTENT AND

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:08.139 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:10.408 region:rollup2
FROM YOU WHY WE. ARE IN THIS

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:11.409 region:rollup2
POSITION TODAY WHO AM I I THINK

00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:12.944 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE SAYING THE SAME

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:14.279 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE WILL END UP WE

00:40:12.944 --> 00:40:16.047 region:rollup2
WILL UPDATE THIS AT BUDGET ACT

00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:19.083 region:rollup2
WITH WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE'S.

00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:21.119 region:rollup2
APPROVED AMOUNTS ARE SO THIS

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:22.453 region:rollup2
WAS JUST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:24.022 region:rollup2
ASSUMING THAT THAT ADDITIONAL.

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:25.890 region:rollup2
REVENUE TO ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT

00:40:24.022 --> 00:40:27.058 region:rollup2
WAS MADE IT TO BE A THING WHICH

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.927 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER.

00:40:27.058 --> 00:40:29.661 region:rollup2
TRACKING OF REVENUES AND

00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:30.528 region:rollup2
TRANSFERS

00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:33.197 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REDUCED FROM THAT

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:34.766 region:rollup2
AMOUNT.

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:36.301 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING IS WHY

00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:38.736 region:rollup2
WOULD WE APPROVE IT IF YOU'RE

00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:40.571 region:rollup2
NOT EXPLAINING IT. TO LOOK WHY

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:41.639 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AND WE BE ENCOURAGED TO

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:42.440 region:rollup2
VOTE FOR THAT YOU'RE ASSUMING

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:44.409 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON IT

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.943 region:rollup2
BUT IF IT'S NOT CLEAR NOW. THEN

00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:46.644 region:rollup2
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT I THINK

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:48.446 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE I THINK THE

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:49.714 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT IS IS YOU'RE SAYING

00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:51.449 region:rollup2
ASSUMING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:40:49.714 --> 00:40:53.484 region:rollup2
PROVES THAT BY. YOU NOT GIVING

00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:54.552 region:rollup2
ME INFORMATION IN ORDER TO

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:57.021 region:rollup2
APPROVE IT AND SO.

00:40:54.552 --> 00:40:59.424 region:rollup2
I'M UNDERSTANDING EITHER.

00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:01.426 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SEPARATE DETERMINATION

00:40:59.424 --> 00:41:02.660 region:rollup2
SOAP THE WHATEVER THE

00:41:01.426 --> 00:41:04.095 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DETERMINES AS A

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.430 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSIT IF THEY

00:41:04.095 --> 00:41:06.531 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO DO ONE.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.999 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE IT.

00:41:06.531 --> 00:41:09.534 region:rollup2
.

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:11.469 region:rollup2
BUILT INTO THE REVENUES FOR

00:41:09.534 --> 00:41:13.104 region:rollup2
VARIOUS PRODUCTS BUT THEN FOR

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:13.671 region:rollup2
THIS CALCULATION WOULD BE AT THE

00:41:13.104 --> 00:41:15.640 region:rollup2
FINAL WHATEVER THAT AMOUNTS

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:19.644 region:rollup2
IT'S.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:20.945 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE IT GOING PLEASE.

00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:22.613 region:rollup2
I THINK NOT ONLY SUPPOSE A VERY

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:26.551 region:rollup2
CLEARLY.

00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:28.586 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PRESENTING AN ASSUMED.

00:41:26.551 --> 00:41:30.421 region:rollup2
AMOUNT WITHOUT PRESENTING THE

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:31.889 region:rollup2
FULL AMOUNT

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:34.392 region:rollup2
SO ALL OF YOUR CALCULATIONS THE

00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:36.761 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PRESENTING TO US TODAY.

00:41:34.392 --> 00:41:38.062 region:rollup2
IT USING A ENDING THIS IS THE

00:41:36.761 --> 00:41:40.098 region:rollup2
BEST DOUBLE SPEAK OF EVER HEARD

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:42.367 region:rollup2
IN MY LIFE.

00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:43.801 region:rollup2
IT YOU'RE SHOWING US BASED UPON

00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:45.536 region:rollup2
AN ASSUMPTION.

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:48.206 region:rollup2
THAT IT SHORT CHANGED

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:50.041 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF THE FULL AMOUNTS.

00:41:48.206 --> 00:41:51.142 region:rollup2
THE IS IS WHAT IT WHAT I'M TAKEN

00:41:50.041 --> 00:41:52.477 region:rollup2
FROM AND I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY

00:41:51.142 --> 00:41:53.711 region:rollup2
ELSE APPEAR ON THE DICE IS TAKEN

00:41:52.477 --> 00:41:57.448 region:rollup2
FROM A MAN.

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:59.183 region:rollup2
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US.

00:41:57.448 --> 00:42:00.718 region:rollup2
TO TAKE YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:01.552 region:rollup2
WILL DECIDE SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:06.457 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T PRESENTED WITH THE FULL

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:07.525 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS.

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:08.860 region:rollup2
AND AND FROM THE

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:10.428 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THE

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.163 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:10.428 --> 00:42:13.531 region:rollup2
WAS TO MAKE THAT SUPPLEMENTAL

00:42:12.163 --> 00:42:14.899 region:rollup2
DEPOSIT AND THEN ALL THE

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:16.634 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS WOULD CONSISTENTLY

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:18.002 region:rollup2
REPRESENT THAT TRANSFER IN THAT

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:19.537 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL AMOUNT SO I THINK.

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:21.739 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A CHOICE YOU COULD

00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:23.441 region:rollup2
MAKE AS WELL TO NOT CREATE A NET

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:25.610 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE TRANSFER.

00:42:23.441 --> 00:42:27.678 region:rollup2
YOU COULD CHOOSE TO MAKE THIS AS

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:30.448 region:rollup2
AN OPTIONAL PAYMENT.

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:31.883 region:rollup2
ON PAPER. AS THE LA OBRA FLEX

00:42:30.448 --> 00:42:33.384 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD RESULT IN EIGHT

00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:35.253 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INCREASE

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:37.121 region:rollup2
IN TO MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT AND

00:42:35.253 --> 00:42:39.057 region:rollup2
SO I QUESTION YOU AGAIN.

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:41.125 region:rollup2
WHY DID WE DECIDE TO DO THIS AS

00:42:39.057 --> 00:42:43.261 region:rollup2
A NET NEGATIVE TRANSFER AND IS

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:45.063 region:rollup2
THERE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US

00:42:43.261 --> 00:42:46.964 region:rollup2
TO REEVALUATE THAT PRECEDENT

00:42:45.063 --> 00:42:49.500 region:rollup2
SETTING DECISION?

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:50.234 region:rollup2
HOW DID WE COME TO THAT DECISION

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.637 region:rollup2
AND?

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:53.938 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD TO

00:42:52.637 --> 00:42:56.741 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THIS IS THE BEST

00:42:53.938 --> 00:43:00.178 region:rollup2
PROCESS WE HAVE?

00:42:56.741 --> 00:43:02.146 region:rollup2
IT. THE DETERMINATION TO FILL

00:43:00.178 --> 00:43:03.748 region:rollup2
THE THE RAINY DAY FUND.

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:05.750 region:rollup2
TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL MINIMUM

00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:07.819 region:rollup2
WAS SEPARATE AND ASSUMING THAT

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:09.687 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE ADOPTION IT THEN BY

00:43:07.819 --> 00:43:11.222 region:rollup2
JUNE THIRTIETH THAT WOULD BE

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:12.990 region:rollup2
LESS REVENUE AVAILABLE WHICH WAS

00:43:11.222 --> 00:43:13.991 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAME UP WITH. THE

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.526 region:rollup2
CALCULATION FOR WHEN YOU'RE

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:16.527 region:rollup2
DETERMINING HOW MUCH REVENUE IS

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.829 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR PROP FIFTY FIVE

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:19.564 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:21.265 region:rollup2
AND FOR TAKING MONEY FROM THE

00:43:19.564 --> 00:43:23.234 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PROTECTION ACCOUNT. IT

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:24.335 region:rollup2
WAS MORE OF A COMPARISON OF WHAT

00:43:23.234 --> 00:43:25.670 region:rollup2
IS AVAILABLE AS OF JUNE

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:27.738 region:rollup2
THIRTIETH AND SO.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:29.373 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT REPRESENTATION OF

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:30.708 region:rollup2
THAT REVENUE WAS AS OF THAT

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:39.750 region:rollup2
POINT OF TIME IS WHY WE

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:41.519 region:rollup2
SUBTRACTED IT HERE.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:43.421 region:rollup2
LET ME SWITCH TO THE WORKLOAD

00:43:41.519 --> 00:43:45.857 region:rollup2
BUDGET JUST SO THAT WE MAY HAVE

00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:47.892 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY TO. CONTINUE TO

00:43:45.857 --> 00:43:49.794 region:rollup2
PONDER WHAT HE JUST SAID.

00:43:47.892 --> 00:43:51.863 region:rollup2
THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION THAT

00:43:49.794 --> 00:43:54.732 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT AN OPTIONAL

00:43:51.863 --> 00:43:56.567 region:rollup2
SPENDING HAVE ALL BEEN. INCLUDED

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:59.570 region:rollup2
INTO THE WORKLOAD BUDGET.

00:43:56.567 --> 00:44:02.206 region:rollup2
AND. I AM WANTING TO UNDERSTAND

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:03.875 region:rollup2
HOW EVERYTHING THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:04.976 region:rollup2
PUT IN WAS ALREADY INCLUDED AS

00:44:03.875 --> 00:44:06.477 region:rollup2
OF JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY

00:44:04.976 --> 00:44:08.179 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN.

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:10.581 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS IF.

00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:12.316 region:rollup2
AGAIN WORK CREATING ON PAPER A

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:14.485 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE WE WILL HAVE

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:15.720 region:rollup2
ZERO DOLLARS TO SPEND ON MEDICAL

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:17.622 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE SEVEN POINT FIVE

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.956 region:rollup2
BILLION IN SURPLUS.

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:21.559 region:rollup2
AND I'M QUESTIONING IF FOR OF

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:23.661 region:rollup2
RESPECTING VOTERS CONTENT.

00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:24.862 region:rollup2
BY CREATING A SITUATION WHERE WE

00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:26.697 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT.

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:28.599 region:rollup2
.

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:30.501 region:rollup2
IT IT SEEMS AS IF IT BOTH DOUBLE

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:32.136 region:rollup2
SPEAK AND AND FRANKLY IT'S

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.703 region:rollup2
COOKING THE BOOKS A BIT.

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:34.939 region:rollup2
AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:37.642 region:rollup2
WHY.

00:44:34.939 --> 00:44:40.811 region:rollup2
WE'VE MADE THESE ASSUMPTIONS IS

00:44:37.642 --> 00:44:42.880 region:rollup2
THERE A WAY TO WHAT EXTENT AND

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:44.415 region:rollup2
WHY WE HAVE DONE.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.583 region:rollup2
UP I I THINK VILLAGE CIVILES DID

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.918 region:rollup2
A GREAT JOB OF KIND OF

00:44:45.583 --> 00:44:48.252 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING WHAT WAS THE

00:44:46.918 --> 00:44:49.086 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY IN DOING SOMETHING

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:51.556 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:53.090 region:rollup2
WE WERE TAKING A BROAD APPROACH

00:44:51.556 --> 00:44:54.525 region:rollup2
TO THE DEFINITION AND IT IS THE

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.259 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF THE PROPOSED

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:57.328 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:58.563 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED WORKLOAD. THERE WAS A

00:44:57.328 --> 00:45:00.631 region:rollup2
SMALL PORTION THAT WE LOOKED AT

00:44:58.563 --> 00:45:01.666 region:rollup2
THE END AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:03.634 region:rollup2
THE PROXIMATE THIRTY SEVEN

00:45:01.666 --> 00:45:04.702 region:rollup2
MILLION. THAT WE DIDN'T CONSIDER

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:05.870 region:rollup2
PART OF CURRENTLY AUTHOR I

00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:08.039 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:09.807 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED

00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:11.609 region:rollup2
IN THE REPORT IT THEY'RE TRYING

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:14.378 region:rollup2
TO PROJECT OR TRACK THOSE

00:45:11.609 --> 00:45:16.514 region:rollup2
ONGOING. A WE WERE LOOKING FOR

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:16.881 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO THIS

00:45:16.514 --> 00:45:18.983 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION.

00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:21.886 region:rollup2
AND I CAN APPRECIATE I DID LIKE

00:45:18.983 --> 00:45:23.821 region:rollup2
THE LA DOES. WRITING UP OF IT IN

00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:25.089 region:rollup2
TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO.

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:26.958 region:rollup2
WORK FORWARD IT WOULD BE

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:29.093 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO CONSTANTLY COME

00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:29.393 region:rollup2
BACK TO JANUARY FIRST BUT.

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:31.095 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE.

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:33.264 region:rollup2
.

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:34.432 region:rollup2
AND AM LOOKING TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:45:33.264 --> 00:45:36.801 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE TO WORK WITH THIS

00:45:34.432 --> 00:45:38.336 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:41.072 region:rollup2
MEETING. OUR.

00:45:38.336 --> 00:45:42.740 region:rollup2
STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS WITH

00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:44.775 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:46.877 region:rollup2
AND FRANKLY DON'T FEEL THAT

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:48.512 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE TO THAT POINT YET I

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:49.380 region:rollup2
THINK MANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:51.148 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.951 region:rollup2
.

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:57.255 region:rollup2
I FIND A TROUBLING AT BEST.

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:59.156 region:rollup2
I I FIND THAT THE DECISION TO

00:45:57.255 --> 00:46:00.725 region:rollup2
EXCLUDE THAT OPTIONAL THREE AND

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:02.159 region:rollup2
A HALF BILLION WILL TAKE

00:46:00.725 --> 00:46:03.628 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:05.896 region:rollup2
AWAY.

00:46:03.628 --> 00:46:07.598 region:rollup2
FROM NETWORKS THAT WE WILL HEAR

00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:10.167 region:rollup2
LATER TODAY THAT NEED HELP.

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:11.802 region:rollup2
AND I WONDER WHY WE HAVE MADE

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:11.969 region:rollup2
THAT DECISION.

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:12.637 region:rollup2
TO.

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:14.405 region:rollup2
.

00:46:12.637 --> 00:46:15.640 region:rollup2
.

00:46:14.405 --> 00:46:17.041 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES NOT HERE THAT I DO

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.409 region:rollup2
NOT HEAR.

00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:20.111 region:rollup2
BETTER ANSWERS FROM THE

00:46:18.409 --> 00:46:21.812 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THAT WILL HELP US TO

00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:23.848 region:rollup2
DRIVE FOR THAT.

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:25.316 region:rollup2
SO AT THIS POINT WILL LOOK TO

00:46:23.848 --> 00:46:28.486 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF YOU

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:29.954 region:rollup2
HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO IT.

00:46:28.486 --> 00:46:31.322 region:rollup2
WHAT FOR ME I'M REALLY NOT

00:46:29.954 --> 00:46:32.156 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING I I DON'T

00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:34.859 region:rollup2
KNOW IF IT'S JUST ME

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:35.493 region:rollup2
MISUNDERSTANDING BUT IT JUST

00:46:34.859 --> 00:46:36.260 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S MATCHING

00:46:35.493 --> 00:46:37.395 region:rollup2
WITH?

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.562 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'RE NOT GIVING CLEAR

00:46:37.395 --> 00:46:40.865 region:rollup2
ANSWERS I GUESS THAT'S WHERE THE

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:42.466 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION IS THAT I KNOW MAYBE

00:46:40.865 --> 00:46:44.235 region:rollup2
I NEED A CHART OR SOMETHING TO

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.869 region:rollup2
SHOW ME SPECIFICALLY WHAT WHAT

00:46:44.235 --> 00:46:45.936 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DOING WITH THE MONEY IT'S

00:46:44.869 --> 00:46:47.238 region:rollup2
JUST.

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:48.372 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING I FEEL LIKE I'M

00:46:47.238 --> 00:46:49.640 region:rollup2
GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND WE'RE

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.374 region:rollup2
NOT GETTING THE ANSWER AND

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.375 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THE FRUSTRATION

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:52.743 region:rollup2
COMES ANDERSON AS WE GET

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.177 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATED YOU GONNA START

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.278 region:rollup2
HEARING CURING MORE.

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:57.314 region:rollup2
.

00:46:54.278 --> 00:47:00.818 region:rollup2
IT'S SO IF YOU CAN SPEAK AND.

00:46:57.314 --> 00:47:02.219 region:rollup2
NON. NON ACCOUNTING LANGUAGE

00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:04.422 region:rollup2
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER BECAUSE I'M

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:05.890 region:rollup2
STILL COMPLETELY LOST AS TO WHY

00:47:04.422 --> 00:47:06.857 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A DEFICIT I MEAN THAT'S

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:09.060 region:rollup2
JUST THE BOTTOM LINE I DON'T

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:10.194 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND. AND SO I APPRECIATE

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.897 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE BUT WHY DO WE

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:14.198 region:rollup2
HAVE A DIFFERENCE.

00:47:12.897 --> 00:47:15.332 region:rollup2
I THINK SAID THE GENERAL

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:16.467 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTION THERE IS THERE'S A

00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:17.401 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF THINGS AND IT'S

00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:18.636 region:rollup2
PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:20.204 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE DISPLAYS IN THE

00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:22.540 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT THE

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:24.008 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER THAT CONFUSION. OF.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.476 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MULTI YEAR

00:47:24.008 --> 00:47:27.845 region:rollup2
DISPLAY YOU'LL SEE.

00:47:25.476 --> 00:47:29.046 region:rollup2
THIS HUGE CARRYING BALANCE AND

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:29.213 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THERE'S

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:31.282 region:rollup2
A.

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.749 region:rollup2
ALONG A HUGE RESOURCE BUT

00:47:31.282 --> 00:47:33.584 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT PART OF THE

00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:35.619 region:rollup2
CALCULATION FOR. PROP FIFTY FIVE

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:36.120 region:rollup2
SO I THINK PART OF THAT IS

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:38.222 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLE

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.756 region:rollup2
DISPLAYS.

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:40.257 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE REPRESENTING

00:47:38.756 --> 00:47:41.025 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:42.193 region:rollup2
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO UP TO

00:47:41.025 --> 00:47:44.195 region:rollup2
PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO YOUR

00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:44.628 region:rollup2
STAFF AT THAT WOULD.

00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:46.063 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD HELP TO?

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:47.465 region:rollup2
?

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:49.033 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE CHART WELL IT'S

00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:50.401 region:rollup2
YES BUT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF

00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:51.769 region:rollup2
THIS THIS HEARING IS FOR

00:47:50.401 --> 00:47:53.771 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ELSE TO UNDERSTAND I

00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:55.372 region:rollup2
JUST ME GET MY PRIVATE. YOU KNOW

00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:56.774 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION SO I APPRECIATE AND

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:58.576 region:rollup2
I'LL TAKE YOU UP ON IT BUT IS

00:47:56.774 --> 00:47:59.643 region:rollup2
THERE A MORE CONCISE WAY SO WE

00:47:58.576 --> 00:48:00.911 region:rollup2
CAN SAID SO THAT EVERYBODY ELSE

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.479 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.012 region:rollup2
OF THESE HEARINGS THAT THAT

00:48:01.479 --> 00:48:03.314 region:rollup2
WERE.

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:04.348 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MAKING THE PUBLIC

00:48:03.314 --> 00:48:05.049 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING ALL

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:07.785 region:rollup2
OF THESE AND IF I DON'T

00:48:05.049 --> 00:48:10.154 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND AND I'M NOT YOU KNOW.

00:48:07.785 --> 00:48:12.022 region:rollup2
IN THE BUSINESS BUT I'D I FOR

00:48:10.154 --> 00:48:13.724 region:rollup2
CONFUSED I THINK MOST OF OUR

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:16.060 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE IS CONFUSED AS WELL AND

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:17.561 region:rollup2
SO. I APPRECIATE OUT TAKE YOU UP

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:21.232 region:rollup2
CONCISE WAY OR MORE CLEAR WAY OF

00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:22.366 region:rollup2
EXPLAINING IT SO THAT EVERYBODY

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:25.703 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS AND NOT JUST ME AND

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:26.604 region:rollup2
MY STAFF.

00:48:25.703 --> 00:48:28.739 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN EASIER

00:48:26.604 --> 00:48:30.207 region:rollup2
WAY I'M THINK I'M I'M PICTURING

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:32.209 region:rollup2
ARE ARE MULTI YOUR DISPLAY THAT

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:33.744 region:rollup2
HAS THE SAME REVENUES BUT IT

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:35.713 region:rollup2
DISPLAYS THEM DIFFERENTLY AND

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:36.881 region:rollup2
THE DEFICIT THAT YOU SEE. OR THE

00:48:35.713 --> 00:48:38.149 region:rollup2
SURPLUS THAT YOU SEE WOULD BE

00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:40.217 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND.

00:48:38.149 --> 00:48:41.585 region:rollup2
THE PROPERTY FIVE CHART WILL

00:48:40.217 --> 00:48:43.721 region:rollup2
SHOW PIECES OF THE SAME

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:44.922 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND SO YOU YOU DON'T

00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:46.457 region:rollup2
SEE THE SAME THING ACROSS.

00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:48.359 region:rollup2
WELL WHY WOULD THIS NOT SET A

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:50.194 region:rollup2
PRECEDENT THOUGH BEYOND THIS

00:48:48.359 --> 00:48:51.695 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THAT FUTURE

00:48:50.194 --> 00:48:54.365 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIONS COULD MAKE.

00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:56.100 region:rollup2
SIMILAR OPTIONAL DEPOSITS

00:48:54.365 --> 00:48:57.868 region:rollup2
INTO FUNDS WHY IS THIS NOT

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.470 region:rollup2
PRECEDENT SETTING.

00:48:57.868 --> 00:49:01.172 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY. ADMINISTRATION TO

WANT TO.

00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:04.708 region:rollup2
SEEMINGLY TAKE FUNDS AWAY FROM

MEDI CAL.

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:08.112 region:rollup2
THIS SEEMS AS IF IT'S A

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:09.980 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT DECISION MADE FROM

00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:13.284 region:rollup2
ONE BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE

AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH.

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:28.879 region:rollup2
IT MAYBE IN THE FUTURE AS

ARE WE GONNA BE USING SOME OF

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.083 region:rollup2

I DO HOPE SO I THINK AS YOU NOTE

00:55:29.193 --> 00:55:31.562 region:rollup2
IN THE.

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:32.830 region:rollup2
IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THE

00:55:31.562 --> 00:55:34.531 region:rollup2
THINKING AS WE'RE MOVING TOWARD

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:35.499 region:rollup2
A SINGLE STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT'S

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.500 region:rollup2
GONNA TAKE A FEW YEARS AGO TO

00:55:35.499 --> 00:55:37.968 region:rollup2
TAKE MORE THAN JUST TWO YEARS

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.136 region:rollup2
WHICH HENCE MY COMMENT ABOUT I

00:55:37.968 --> 00:55:40.470 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS KIND OF AN ONGOING

00:55:39.136 --> 00:55:41.838 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AROUND.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.807 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT WE GET THE COST

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:44.841 region:rollup2
INCREASES THAT WE NEED THE

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:46.210 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR THE ACTUAL NEW

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:47.244 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS OF THE IN A SEPARATE

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:48.912 region:rollup2
BUDGET ITEM IT WOULDN'T BE HERE

00:55:47.244 --> 00:55:50.013 region:rollup2
EMBEDDED IN THIS BUDGET ITEM.

00:55:48.912 --> 00:55:51.515 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE IN VERY CLOSE

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.115 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONAL WORKING A GOOD

00:55:51.515 --> 00:55:53.417 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:55.719 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION TO GET THAT DONE.

00:55:53.417 --> 00:55:56.787 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING FOR

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:58.522 region:rollup2
A FEW MONTHS.

00:55:56.787 --> 00:55:59.656 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF MONTHS TO

00:55:58.522 --> 00:56:00.924 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE WE CAN

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:03.660 region:rollup2
IMPROVE.

00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:05.329 region:rollup2
ON OUR PROCESSING OF CASES THAT

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.697 region:rollup2
WERE PRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:08.498 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD CASES THAT WERE UNDER

00:56:06.697 --> 00:56:09.333 region:rollup2
THE OLD RULES AND MAKING SURE

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:11.435 region:rollup2
THAT WE BROUGHT THE MEN UNDER

00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:12.536 region:rollup2
THE NEW RULES WHICH IS A MORE

00:56:11.435 --> 00:56:14.471 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT AND GENERAL. AND SO ON

00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:15.405 region:rollup2
THAT SOME OF THE WORK THAT IS ON

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:17.274 region:rollup2
BEING DONE WITH THE STATE RIGHT

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:18.709 region:rollup2
NOW TO GENERATE LISTS FOR THE

00:56:17.274 --> 00:56:20.277 region:rollup2
COUNTY SO WE CAN. WORK THROUGH

00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:21.111 region:rollup2
THOSE AND GET THOSE OUT OF THE

00:56:20.277 --> 00:56:23.247 region:rollup2
ONE EIGHT CODE IN INTO THE

00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:24.281 region:rollup2
PROPER LONG GOING EIGHT CODE AND

00:56:23.247 --> 00:56:26.049 region:rollup2
TRY TO GET THAT CLEARED OFF THE

00:56:24.281 --> 00:56:27.784 region:rollup2
BOOKS SO I THINK BOTH FROM AN IT

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:29.553 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE. AND ALSO FROM SORT

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:30.687 region:rollup2
OF A MANAGING THE CASELOAD

00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:32.856 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WE'VE GOT.

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:33.657 region:rollup2

RIGHT TRACK FINALLY.

00:56:34.992 --> 00:56:39.463 region:rollup2
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.931 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF

00:56:39.463 --> 00:56:42.299 region:rollup2
HAS RECOMMENDED HOLDING THIS

00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:43.700 region:rollup2
ITEM OPEN AND WE WILL TAKE NO

00:56:42.299 --> 00:56:59.883 region:rollup2
ACTION AT THIS TIME MOVE ON TO

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:59.883 region:rollup2
ISSUE THREE

00:57:00.284 --> 00:57:01.218 region:rollup2
.

00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:03.587 region:rollup2
SO.

00:57:01.218 --> 00:57:05.122 region:rollup2
FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY SPECS.

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:07.424 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW.

00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:08.458 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A NEGOTIATION.

00:57:07.424 --> 00:57:09.860 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR BETWEEN THE

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:12.496 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:15.232 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND HOW TO USE THOSE

00:57:12.496 --> 00:57:16.900 region:rollup2
FUNDS ON THEY ARE STRUCTURED AS

00:57:15.232 --> 00:57:18.769 region:rollup2
ONE YEAR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS.

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:21.538 region:rollup2
THERE WAS MONEY THAT WAS.

00:57:18.769 --> 00:57:23.540 region:rollup2
DEDICATED FOR OUR HIV WAIVER

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:26.310 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THERE WAS.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:28.745 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR ICF DD'S THERE WAS

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:28.912 region:rollup2
A I'M SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASES

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:29.313 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:31.181 region:rollup2
.

00:57:29.313 --> 00:57:32.749 region:rollup2
WOMEN'S HEALTH

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:34.584 region:rollup2

00:57:32.749 --> 00:57:36.320 region:rollup2
A PENCIL RATE INCREASE THE ODDS

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:37.888 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.856 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND.

00:57:37.888 --> 00:57:41.825 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:43.126 region:rollup2
THAT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:44.895 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THEY

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:47.264 region:rollup2
REQUIRE BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE

00:57:44.895 --> 00:57:48.465 region:rollup2
INTERNAL SYSTEMS CHANGES TO OUR.

00:57:47.264 --> 00:57:49.666 region:rollup2
COMPUTER SYSTEMS BUT THEY ALSO

00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:51.635 region:rollup2
REQUIRE.

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:53.337 region:rollup2
APPROVALS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:54.671 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN

00:57:53.337 --> 00:57:56.273 region:rollup2
MOVING ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:58.475 region:rollup2
PIECES ALONG THE FIRST ONE THAT

00:57:56.273 --> 00:58:00.210 region:rollup2
WAS THE EASIEST TO DO WITH HIV.

00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:01.545 region:rollup2
WAIVER AGENCY INCREASE THAT WAS

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:02.779 region:rollup2
A WAIVER AMENDMENT AND THAT WAS

00:58:01.545 --> 00:58:04.848 region:rollup2
VERY QUICKLY DONE.

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:06.350 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT HAVE TAKEN A LOT

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:07.217 region:rollup2
LONGER WORD THE DIRECTED

00:58:07.217 --> 00:58:10.620 region:rollup2
FOR PHYSICIANS SERVICES AND

00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:12.322 region:rollup2
DENTAL SERVICES BECAUSE WE ARE

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.690 region:rollup2
HAVING TO FLOW THOSE

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:15.525 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THROUGH

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:17.194 region:rollup2
OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THAT

00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:19.296 region:rollup2
ALSO COINCIDED AT THE TIME THAT

00:58:17.194 --> 00:58:20.497 region:rollup2
WE WERE SEEKING NOT APPROVAL. IT

00:58:19.296 --> 00:58:21.565 region:rollup2
COINCIDED WITH THE

00:58:20.497 --> 00:58:22.933 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL

00:58:21.565 --> 00:58:25.702 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE ROLE IN WHICH WAS A

00:58:22.933 --> 00:58:27.170 region:rollup2
NEW STRUCTURE ALTOGETHER AND SO

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:28.472 region:rollup2
WE JUST RECENTLY RECEIVED

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.673 region:rollup2
APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL

00:58:28.472 --> 00:58:30.207 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ON THE DIRECTED

00:58:29.673 --> 00:58:31.908 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS FOR THE PHYSICIAN

00:58:30.207 --> 00:58:33.610 region:rollup2
RATES.

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:35.612 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:37.114 region:rollup2
ALL THAT BEING SAID IS THAT.

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:39.116 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ALWAYS TAKES LONGER.

00:58:37.114 --> 00:58:40.250 region:rollup2
EVEN WHEN WE'RE MOVING AS FAST

00:58:39.116 --> 00:58:41.818 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE.

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:43.720 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY.

00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:44.988 region:rollup2
WILL BE FLOWING THOSE FUNDS

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.522 region:rollup2
BACK

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:47.424 region:rollup2
TO JULY FIRST AND SO EVEN

00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:49.960 region:rollup2
THOUGH.

00:58:47.424 --> 00:58:51.628 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON WHO THE PHYSICIAN

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.696 region:rollup2
IS AND WHAT THOSE SERVICES WERE.

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:54.531 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT THEY PROVIDED

00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:55.599 region:rollup2
AFTER JULY FIRST WILL HAVE THAT

00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:57.868 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT.

00:58:55.599 --> 00:58:58.969 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO THEM AND SO I THINK

00:58:57.868 --> 00:58:59.870 region:rollup2
ON AN ONGOING BASIS WERE

00:58:58.969 --> 00:59:02.873 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:03.106 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SMOOTH THE PATH

00:59:02.873 --> 00:59:04.341 region:rollup2
ON IT.

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:06.977 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TO SEEK

00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:08.378 region:rollup2
NEW ANNUAL APPROVALS ON A YEAR

00:59:06.977 --> 00:59:10.046 region:rollup2
BY YEAR BASIS EVEN IF NOTHING IS

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.580 region:rollup2
CHANGED WE WOULD HAVE TO GO AND

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:11.314 region:rollup2
GET THAT APPROVAL AND SO I

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.983 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:14.284 region:rollup2
.

00:59:12.983 --> 00:59:15.986 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'LL TRY

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:16.887 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT IS TO ANTICIPATE AND

00:59:15.986 --> 00:59:18.188 region:rollup2
OR BE TALKING TO OUR FEDERAL

00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:19.523 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES.

00:59:18.188 --> 00:59:20.824 region:rollup2
I'M IN ADVANCE AND CERTAINLY THE

00:59:19.523 --> 00:59:22.259 region:rollup2
MORE COMFORTABLE THEY ARE WITH

00:59:20.824 --> 00:59:24.161 region:rollup2
DOING THESE PAYMENTS THAT WILL

00:59:22.259 --> 00:59:26.163 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY GET EASIER. THAT

00:59:24.161 --> 00:59:27.097 region:rollup2
NEWEST ON PROPOSAL THAT WAS

00:59:26.163 --> 00:59:28.498 region:rollup2

FIFTY SIX WHICH I SPOKE TO

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.171 region:rollup2
EARLIER. IS THAT FIFTY PERCENT.

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:36.540 region:rollup2
RATE INCREASE FOR THE HOME

00:59:34.171 --> 00:59:38.341 region:rollup2

WE WOULD BE PROVIDED IN THESE.

00:59:48.852 --> 00:59:52.222 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CATEGORIES.

00:59:50.387 --> 00:59:54.758 region:rollup2

01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:21.697 region:rollup2
WAY I THINK WAS DISCUSSED

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:22.265 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAT THERE'S A SPA AND

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:23.833 region:rollup2
THAT WILL AND ON THE END OF

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:25.768 region:rollup2
JUNE.

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:27.069 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THE BEST WAY TO

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.970 region:rollup2
AND BE VERY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.505 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THESE RATES DON'T

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:31.407 region:rollup2
WORK IS TO HAVE THEM START AND

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:32.541 region:rollup2
STOP AND START AGAIN. EYES WE

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.277 region:rollup2
JUST REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:35.745 region:rollup2
THERE'S A WAY TO CONTINUE THESE

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:36.879 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T HAVE DENNIS WHO ARE

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:38.114 region:rollup2
DOING WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:39.348 region:rollup2
WHICH IS YOU KNOW TAKING MORE

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:40.850 region:rollup2
DENTICLE PATIENTS GETTING BACK

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:42.318 region:rollup2
INTO THE PROGRAM. WHO THEN ALL

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:44.687 region:rollup2
OF A SUDDEN CD'S RATES ARE OF

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:45.421 region:rollup2
STOP INCOME WONDER WHAT WHAT THE

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:47.556 region:rollup2
HECK IS GOING ON HERE?

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:49.125 region:rollup2
WE DO AGREE THAT PREVENTION AND

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:50.593 region:rollup2
PERRY O. OUT DUMB DISEASE

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:52.228 region:rollup2
TREATMENT HOULD BE PRIORITIZE

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:53.496 region:rollup2
AS THE DEPARTMENT IS I'M.

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:54.931 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WHERE TO SPENDTHESE

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:56.832 region:rollup2
DOLLARS NEXT AND WANT TO BE A

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:58.034 region:rollup2
PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.567 region:rollup2
AND THEN I THINK WE ALSO WANNA

01:13:58.034 --> 01:14:00.503 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT UNDER

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:02.305 region:rollup2
SPENDING ON THE WE ARE AIMING TO

01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:03.539 region:rollup2
HIT THOSE NUMBERS THAT WE PUT

01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:05.474 region:rollup2

YEAR AND NEXT YEAR. AND WE'RE

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:08.544 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:09.078 region:rollup2
EVALUATION I THINK WE WOULD NOTE

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:11.213 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:12.214 region:rollup2

AND AGAIN I THINK WITH THIS

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.919 region:rollup2
CONCERN ABOUT IF THEY'RE

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.920 region:rollup2

.

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:11.240 region:rollup2
IS THE UNDER SPENDING BECAUSE

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:13.709 region:rollup2

01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:33.863 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR THE DELAY IN THE

SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SO AND THAT

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.709 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER THAT YOU CITED BY

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:21.844 region:rollup2
THOSE IN THE AGENDA THAT IS OUR

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:22.978 region:rollup2
BEST.

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:24.713 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE FOR THE BEST FORECAST

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:26.382 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE AT THIS TIME WE

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:28.517 region:rollup2
WILL BE UPDATING THESE THAT MAY

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:30.286 region:rollup2
REVISION DEPENDING ON WHAT THE

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:31.687 region:rollup2
ACTUAL DATA THAT WE'RE SEEING.

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:33.022 region:rollup2
AND I IN ENGAGING WITH

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:34.490 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW THIS

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:36.358 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS GONE SO FAR AS WE

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:36.992 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE UPDATED INFORMATION AS

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:38.894 region:rollup2
SOON AS THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE.

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:40.830 region:rollup2
.

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:42.064 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE. ISSUES

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:43.165 region:rollup2
THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:44.266 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:46.702 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO GET THIS BRAND NEW

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:48.237 region:rollup2
PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING.

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:49.872 region:rollup2
WE JUST SAW THAT WE CAN GET SOME

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:51.106 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION THE PROGRAM IS UP

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:53.008 region:rollup2
AND RUNNING AND IS WORKING FINE

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:54.844 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE NOT DAM NEXT YEAR SAY

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:55.444 region:rollup2
THAT IT. YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T DO

01:16:54.844 --> 01:16:57.146 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE THE PROGRAM WAS A

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:58.647 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:16:57.146 --> 01:17:00.950 region:rollup2
I'M NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:01.517 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:05.054 region:rollup2
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THE

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:06.555 region:rollup2
SIDE.

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:07.756 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE THAT I WANT TO SEE

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:09.492 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IN THE MAY

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:11.727 region:rollup2
REVISE WITH THAT FULL FUNDING

01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:14.363 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE FOR THE.

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:15.397 region:rollup2
PREVENTIVE WITH THAT GALLON ALL

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:17.466 region:rollup2
THE DENTAL AND EVERYTHING

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:18.267 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.368 region:rollup2
GET THAT FOR THE KIDS.

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:20.536 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO SEE WITHOUT ACTUALLY

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:23.372 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE IN WITH THE

01:17:20.536 --> 01:17:24.874 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:27.276 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THOSE MONIES GO

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:28.777 region:rollup2
THERE WHERE THEY NEEDED ME.

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:30.312 region:rollup2
CAN WE DESCRIBE THE PROCESS A

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:32.715 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF WORKING THROUGH

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:35.251 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN COLLABORATE TOGETHER

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:38.087 region:rollup2
TO INSURE THAT THE SPENDING IS

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:39.989 region:rollup2
MATCHING. OUR MUTUAL PRIORITIES

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:42.958 region:rollup2
AND IF I CAN ECHO THE COMMENTS

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:45.594 region:rollup2
OF WANTING TO ENSURE PREVENTIVE.

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:47.796 region:rollup2
SPENDING. IN ADDITION TO OUR

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:49.999 region:rollup2
PROVIDER RATE INCREASES AS A

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:51.867 region:rollup2
MECHANISM FOR US TO SAVE MONEY

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:53.402 region:rollup2
TO THE SYSTEM OVERALL.

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:55.204 region:rollup2
SURE MAYBE I'LL I'LL START NOW

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:33.375 region:rollup2
WOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH BILL IN

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:34.410 region:rollup2
ANY AND THEM CODE.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.444 region:rollup2
AND WE ATTACHED

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:37.179 region:rollup2
IF IT DOLLAR AMOUNTS TO THOSE IN

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:38.948 region:rollup2
M. VISITS AND THERE WERE THREE

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:40.416 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRIC VISITS

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:42.518 region:rollup2
ARE PSYCHIATRIC CODES THAT WE

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:44.520 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED BECAUSE.

01:18:42.518 --> 01:18:45.454 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRY IN CHILD PSYCHIATRY

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.689 region:rollup2
ARE VERY MUCH.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:48.757 region:rollup2
IN BOTH.

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:49.658 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE AND WE WANTED TO

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:51.160 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:53.095 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRISTS PARTICIPATING IN

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.264 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM. THE OTHER CODES

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:57.933 region:rollup2
WERE CHOSEN TO BE BROAD BASED

01:18:55.264 --> 01:18:58.467 region:rollup2
AND TO ATTRACT POSITIONS OF ALL

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:00.803 region:rollup2
CAPACITY.

01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:02.071 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TRIED VERY HARD BECAUSE

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:03.739 region:rollup2
AGAIN AS YOU HEAR SOME OF THE

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:06.408 region:rollup2
DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION IF WE

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:07.643 region:rollup2
GET TOO FANCY IT JUST MAKES IT

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.811 region:rollup2
MORE COMPLICATED WHICH TAKES

01:19:07.643 --> 01:19:10.479 region:rollup2
LONGER AND SO WHEN WE CHOSE

01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:12.481 region:rollup2
THOSE POSITION CODES WE WERE

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:14.016 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO IT. SO THAT WE HIT

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.717 region:rollup2
THE BROADER SWATH OF PHYSICIANS

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:17.286 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

01:19:14.717 --> 01:19:19.054 region:rollup2
USING A STANDARD IN M. CODE AS

01:19:17.286 --> 01:19:21.023 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GET. IN A

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:22.558 region:rollup2
VERY VERY SMALL CODES THAT ARE

01:19:21.023 --> 01:19:24.593 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOU KNOW

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:26.562 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENCIES BUT MAY NOT BE

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:29.465 region:rollup2
BROADER OR MAY NOT AND BE ABLE

01:19:26.562 --> 01:19:30.432 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF. AND BE ESTIMATED SO

01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:32.568 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WAS OUR BEST

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:35.037 region:rollup2
SHOT AT THE TIME. WHEN WE WENT

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:37.273 region:rollup2
TO THE DENTAL CODES THERE ARE

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:39.441 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF DENTAL CODES AND IT

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:40.609 region:rollup2
WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRY TO ATTACH

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:42.811 region:rollup2
A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT TO A

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:44.613 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC DENTAL CODE SO WE DID A

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:47.049 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT INCREASE. OVER

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:47.950 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF DENTAL

01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:51.153 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES SO.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:54.223 region:rollup2
ENDODONTIC AND RESTORE IT IS

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:56.191 region:rollup2
AND WE DELIBERATELY DID NOT DO

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:57.826 region:rollup2
THE PREVENTIVE CATEGORY WITHIN

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:59.728 region:rollup2
THE DENTAL PROGRAM AND THERE WAS

01:19:57.826 --> 01:20:01.063 region:rollup2
A REASON WHY. IS THAT WE HAVE A

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:02.364 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL.

01:20:01.063 --> 01:20:03.632 region:rollup2
FUNDING PROGRAM THAT IS

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:05.200 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY UNDERWAY CALLED THE

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.502 region:rollup2
DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.437 region:rollup2
WHICH IS UNDER OUR MEDI CAL

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:09.905 region:rollup2
WAIVER. WHICH IS A FIVE YEAR

01:20:08.437 --> 01:20:11.440 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATION.

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:12.941 region:rollup2
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.009 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY GEARED ONLY

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:16.345 region:rollup2
TOWARDS CHILDREN AND

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:16.812 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY GEARED TOWARDS

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:17.746 region:rollup2
PREVENTIVE SERVICES.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.081 region:rollup2
.

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:21.483 region:rollup2
PURSUANT TO A LOT OF FEDERAL

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:23.752 region:rollup2
RULES WE CANNOT PAY.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:25.521 region:rollup2
THIS FOR THE SAME THING TWICE

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:27.256 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WERE REALLY CONCERNED

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:28.524 region:rollup2
AGAIN ABOUT NOT WANTING TO MAKE

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:30.025 region:rollup2
IT SO COMPLICATED THAT WE WOULD

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:32.127 region:rollup2
TRIP OVER OURSELVES THAT IF WE

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:33.462 region:rollup2
DID A PREVENTIVE RATE INCREASE.

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:34.763 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAD D.

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:36.298 region:rollup2
T. I WOULD ACTUALLY NOT GET

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:38.300 region:rollup2
FEDERAL APPROVAL BECAUSE OF THE

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:40.569 region:rollup2
FEAR OF DUPLICATING. A PAYMENT

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.836 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WAS WHY WE DID IT

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:42.404 region:rollup2
THAT WAY.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:44.173 region:rollup2
.

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:45.007 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:47.976 region:rollup2
WANTING TO WORK WITH THE

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:49.712 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ON AS THE DATA FOR

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:51.313 region:rollup2
EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT PROVIDER

01:20:49.712 --> 01:20:52.181 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES COMES AND SO THAT WE

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:54.249 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:55.584 region:rollup2
BOTH TARGET THE RIGHT CODES I

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:57.219 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT WE SIT HERE

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.553 region:rollup2
TODAY AND SAY THAT THE CODES

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:59.988 region:rollup2
THAT WE SAW.

01:20:57.553 --> 01:21:01.824 region:rollup2
CHOSE WITH THOSE POSITION CODES

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:03.125 region:rollup2
WHERE THE ONLY BECAUSE WE COULD

01:21:01.824 --> 01:21:05.694 region:rollup2
HAVE CHOSEN THEIR NOT THE.

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:07.296 region:rollup2
THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THE THINGS

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:09.431 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH BUT

01:21:07.296 --> 01:21:11.066 region:rollup2
THEY MET OUR NEEDS I'M GIVEN THE

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:12.301 region:rollup2
SHORT TIMEFRAME GIVEN THE ONE

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:13.969 region:rollup2
YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT AND

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:15.704 region:rollup2
GIVEN OUR INTEREST IN.

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:17.806 region:rollup2
MAKING IT IS APPLICABLE TO AS

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:18.040 region:rollup2
MANY PHYSICIANS AS POSSIBLE SO I

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:19.842 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.343 region:rollup2
ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS AS

01:21:19.842 --> 01:21:22.745 region:rollup2
SOON AS WE CAN PROVIDE THE DATA

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:24.713 region:rollup2
WITH SOME KIND OF OUR INITIAL

01:21:22.745 --> 01:21:26.115 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS. WE WILL BE WORKING

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:27.616 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:21:26.115 --> 01:21:28.517 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TO SAY HERE'S WHAT

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:30.352 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEN.

01:21:28.517 --> 01:21:32.121 region:rollup2
HERE'S MAYBE WHAT WE CAN'T SAY

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:32.855 region:rollup2
YET WITH ANY KIND OF CERTAINTY

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:34.723 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THIS.

01:21:32.855 --> 01:21:36.191 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WILL OR

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:38.060 region:rollup2
WON'T DO FOR PARTICIPATION.

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:38.861 region:rollup2
THERE MAY VERY WELL BE AN

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.463 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT.

01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:42.030 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:42.498 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY LET'S

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:44.032 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:21:42.498 --> 01:21:45.667 region:rollup2
STAY THE COURSE FOR ANOTHER

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:48.270 region:rollup2
YEAR AND SEE IF ANOTHER YEAR OF

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:49.638 region:rollup2
DATA MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE OR

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:51.039 region:rollup2
THERE COULD BE A DECISION BASED

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:52.274 region:rollup2
ON THE DATA THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:53.475 region:rollup2
IN THE ADMINISTRATION SAY. YOU

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:55.010 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:56.812 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T NEW SET OF CODES

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:57.880 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANT YOU TO GO AND

01:21:56.812 --> 01:21:58.881 region:rollup2
ATTACHED CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.783 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS TO AND WE WOULD WORK

01:21:58.881 --> 01:22:02.251 region:rollup2
WITH AND. YOU KNOW OUR INTERNAL

01:22:00.783 --> 01:22:03.819 region:rollup2
STAFF TO DEVELOP ESTIMATES OF

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.686 region:rollup2
WHAT WE THINK THAT COSTS AND

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:06.054 region:rollup2
THEN WE WOULD JUST KIND OF

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:07.623 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED OUT BUT I THINK WHEN

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:09.658 region:rollup2
WE PUT THE. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:11.160 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN JANUARY WE HAD AN

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:12.594 region:rollup2
ABSENCE OF DATA.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.762 region:rollup2
AND DIDN'T FEEL THAT WE WERE IN

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:15.831 region:rollup2
ANY BETTER POSITION TO MAKE A

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:16.965 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION THAN THAN ANYBODY

01:22:15.831 --> 01:22:18.934 region:rollup2
ELSE AND SO WE WE DO WANT TO

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:20.035 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WHEN WHEN

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:22.905 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL HAVE

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:24.807 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT DATA TO MAKE THOSE.

01:22:22.905 --> 01:22:27.342 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATIONS.

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:28.510 region:rollup2
WE'VE ASKED BECAUSE WE'RE IN

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:30.479 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:32.848 region:rollup2
MAY REVISION AS WE SPEAK AND SO

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:34.216 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING FOR EARLY DATA AND

01:22:32.848 --> 01:22:35.083 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IT'S PRETTY EARLY

01:22:34.216 --> 01:22:37.920 region:rollup2
AND TO THE.

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:39.454 region:rollup2
POINT MADE BY FINANCE THE LAGS

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.857 region:rollup2
IN OUR CLAIM SYSTEM.

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:43.659 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN CATCH UP WITH WHAT

01:22:41.857 --> 01:22:44.960 region:rollup2
WAS BILLED IN JULY RIGHT AND SO

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:46.595 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WHAT WAS BILLED IN WHAT

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.964 region:rollup2
RECEIVED A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT.

01:22:46.595 --> 01:22:50.699 region:rollup2
ON THE PHYSICIAN AND THE DENTAL

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:52.000 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE DIRECTED PAYMENTS

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:54.136 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE SO NEW THAT I'M NOT

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.471 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE HAVE. GREAT DATA

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:57.906 region:rollup2
BUT WILL BE CERTAINLY POLLING

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:58.173 region:rollup2
THAT FROM THE HEALTH PLANS.

01:22:57.906 --> 01:22:59.241 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

01:22:58.173 --> 01:23:00.976 region:rollup2
.

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:03.612 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PHYSICIANS AND OTHER

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:05.881 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS HAVE A YEAR TO SUBMIT

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:08.217 region:rollup2
CLAIMS THERE'S ALWAYS A CLAIMS

01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:10.752 region:rollup2
LAG AND SO I WOULD SAY. ANYTHING

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:12.955 region:rollup2
THAT IS IT'S QUOTE GOOD DATA YOU

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:14.523 region:rollup2
USUALLY NEED SIX MONTHS AT LEAST

01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:15.090 region:rollup2
IF NOT A YEAR TO TRY TO MAKE

01:23:14.523 --> 01:23:16.291 region:rollup2
SURE THAT YOU'VE GOT LIKE A

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:18.193 region:rollup2
GOOD.

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:19.862 region:rollup2
CAPTURE BUT I THINK WE YOU KNOW

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:21.063 region:rollup2
WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING. AND

01:23:19.862 --> 01:23:23.265 region:rollup2
GIVING AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND

01:23:21.063 --> 01:23:25.467 region:rollup2
THAT MAY REVISION.

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:27.035 region:rollup2
HOME. WILL LOOK FOR THOSE DATA

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:28.770 region:rollup2
POINTS AS THEY COME BACK AND

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:30.873 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HELP US TO INFORM OUR

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:32.241 region:rollup2
DECISIONS I SEE WESTERN CENTER

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:34.343 region:rollup2
HAS A COMMENT THAT LIKE TO MAKE.

01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:36.178 region:rollup2
IN IN REGARDS TO DUPLICATING

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:37.579 region:rollup2
PREVENTIVE SERVICES OUT WE

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:39.081 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNED THERE

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:40.682 region:rollup2
WOULD NOTE THAT THAT DENTAL

01:23:39.081 --> 01:23:42.184 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE IS

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:44.152 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO CHILDREN OF MISS

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:47.055 region:rollup2
CAN'T SAID. AS WELL AS THERE IS

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:48.724 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ONE ICD TEACH CODE THAT

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:51.293 region:rollup2
IS A PREVENTATIVE THAT SPECIFIC

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:52.694 region:rollup2
TO ADULTS AND SO THAT. I THAT CO

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:54.963 region:rollup2
DOES EXIST AND THAT IS NOT

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:55.430 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:57.799 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT.

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:59.568 region:rollup2
QUICK.

01:23:57.799 --> 01:24:01.670 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST TO CLARIFY SO SO THAT

01:23:59.568 --> 01:24:04.773 region:rollup2
CAN BE INCLUDED. THAT THAT.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:05.974 region:rollup2
CODE BECAUSE I'M.

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:07.075 region:rollup2
I GOT LOST IN THE CLOUDS PARTY

SAID THAT THERE WAS THOUSANDS OF

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:10.679 region:rollup2
CODES ARE IN THE DENTAL IS THAT

01:24:09.278 --> 01:24:11.847 region:rollup2
WHEN SEPARATE FROM THE QUOTES

01:24:10.679 --> 01:24:13.548 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:15.551 region:rollup2
SO IS THAT INCLUDED IN THIS IT'S

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:18.086 region:rollup2
NOT CURRENTLY BUT THAT HER POINT

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:19.221 region:rollup2
IS IS THAT. WE DID NOT INCLUDE

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:20.689 region:rollup2

AND WE DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY AND

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.095 region:rollup2
HER POINT WAS IS THAT. THERE IS

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:28.764 region:rollup2
A SPECIFIC DENTAL CODE FOR

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:30.165 region:rollup2

COLLECTIVELY DECIDE TO AND CRY

01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:34.336 region:rollup2
AND WANT THAT THEN THAT'S MY

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.870 region:rollup2
QUESTION THOUGH BUT WHY WASN'T

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:38.407 region:rollup2

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:38.633 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE CENTERS TIME IS NOT

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:40.301 region:rollup2
A LUXURY THAT THEY CAN AFFORD.

01:35:38.633 --> 01:35:41.703 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES IN LILY'S LIFE SHE'S

01:35:40.301 --> 01:35:43.037 region:rollup2
LOST MAZING CAREGIVERS THAT

01:35:41.703 --> 01:35:44.839 region:rollup2

THEY KNOW WHEN LEFT OVER FORCED

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:48.176 region:rollup2
TO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A WAGE

01:35:46.641 --> 01:35:49.978 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO TAKE

01:35:48.176 --> 01:35:50.878 region:rollup2
CARE OF THEIR OWN FAMILIES.

01:35:49.978 --> 01:35:52.547 region:rollup2
THIS LACK OF FUNDING FOR

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:54.282 region:rollup2

01:35:52.547 --> 01:35:55.950 region:rollup2

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:01.256 region:rollup2
COUNTLESS OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE

I USED TO WORK OUT OF TOWN SO I

01:37:57.271 --> 01:38:01.109 region:rollup2

02:00:36.029 --> 02:00:39.699 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN INCREASED IN THIRTY

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:41.334 region:rollup2
YEARS MOST LIKELY SINCE IT WAS

02:00:39.699 --> 02:00:43.369 region:rollup2
FIRST DETERMINED.

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:45.305 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT ACCESS TO QUALITY

02:00:43.369 --> 02:00:47.107 region:rollup2
BREAST PUMPS ARE UNATTAINABLE

02:00:45.305 --> 02:00:48.608 region:rollup2
FOR MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS THE

02:00:47.107 --> 02:00:50.410 region:rollup2
CURRENT RATES ARE AN ADEQUATE

02:00:48.608 --> 02:00:51.911 region:rollup2
FOR DURABLE MEDICAL. EQUIPMENT

02:00:50.410 --> 02:00:54.447 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS TO

02:00:51.911 --> 02:00:56.216 region:rollup2
PROVIDE QUALITY BREAST PUMPS

02:00:54.447 --> 02:00:57.817 region:rollup2

MOTHERS AND CHILDREN.

02:00:57.817 --> 02:01:03.289 region:rollup2
IMPRESS PUMPS ARE USED FOR MANY.

02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:05.492 region:rollup2
A DURING MANY TIMES OF OF THE

02:01:03.289 --> 02:01:07.193 region:rollup2
SPAN OF BREASTFEEDING AND ONE IS

02:01:05.492 --> 02:01:08.862 region:rollup2
TO INITIATE BREAST FEEDING. AS

02:01:07.193 --> 02:01:09.963 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE MOTHERS ARE BREAST

02:01:08.862 --> 02:01:12.699 region:rollup2
FEEDING THEIR EXPERIENCING

02:01:09.963 --> 02:01:14.400 region:rollup2
COMMON PROBLEMS EARLY ON. AND

02:01:12.699 --> 02:01:16.736 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO HAVE A

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:18.171 region:rollup2
GOOD QUALITY PUMP TO HELP WITH

02:01:16.736 --> 02:01:19.839 region:rollup2
THE INITIATION OF BREASTFEEDING.

02:01:18.171 --> 02:01:22.275 region:rollup2
I'M OUT THERE ALSO USED FOR MORE

02:01:19.839 --> 02:01:23.176 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING CASES SUCH AS FOR

02:01:22.275 --> 02:01:23.610 region:rollup2
PRETERM INFANTS.

02:01:23.176 --> 02:01:26.045 region:rollup2
AND.

02:01:23.610 --> 02:01:28.181 region:rollup2
FOR INFANTS THAT START THEIR

02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:30.617 region:rollup2
LIVES OUT HOSPITALIZED OR SICK

02:01:28.181 --> 02:01:32.118 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY TO

02:01:30.617 --> 02:01:34.254 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO FIRST FOOD TO

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:36.156 region:rollup2
BREAST MILK. AND WHEN MOTHERS

02:01:34.254 --> 02:01:37.857 region:rollup2
ARE HAVING MEDICAL CONDITIONS.

02:01:36.156 --> 02:01:39.726 region:rollup2
MOTHERS WHO WORK OR GO TO SCHOOL

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:41.461 region:rollup2
ALSO DEPEND ON GOOD QUALITY

02:01:39.726 --> 02:01:42.428 region:rollup2
BREAST PUMPS TO EXPRESS MILK

02:01:41.461 --> 02:01:44.230 region:rollup2
WILL THEY'RE SEPARATED FROM

02:01:42.428 --> 02:01:44.898 region:rollup2
THEIR CHILD.

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:46.699 region:rollup2
AND.

02:01:44.898 --> 02:01:48.601 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NECESSARY FOR THOSE

02:01:46.699 --> 02:01:51.037 region:rollup2
PARENTS TO HAVE GOOD SUPPLIES

02:01:48.601 --> 02:01:52.338 region:rollup2
GOOD BREAST PUMPS AND SUPPLIES

02:01:51.037 --> 02:01:55.408 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE PUMPING MULTIPLE

02:01:52.338 --> 02:01:57.076 region:rollup2
TIMES PER DAY. AND IN SHORT.

02:01:55.408 --> 02:01:57.877 region:rollup2
BREAK PERIODS.

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:59.345 region:rollup2
AND THE.

02:01:57.877 --> 02:02:00.580 region:rollup2
TO LEAVE THAT MILK FOR THEIR

02:01:59.345 --> 02:02:02.048 region:rollup2
CARE PROVIDER.

02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:03.816 region:rollup2
TO BE EFFECTIVE BREAST PUMPS

02:02:02.048 --> 02:02:05.451 region:rollup2
MUST BE ENGINEERED TO PROVIDE A

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:07.420 region:rollup2
RANGE OF PRESSURES AND PUMPING

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:08.955 region:rollup2
SPEEDS AND PROVIDE SOME

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:11.791 region:rollup2
ADAPTABILITY OF DIFFERENT FOR

02:02:08.955 --> 02:02:13.026 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN MOTHER'S ANATOMY.

02:02:11.791 --> 02:02:15.295 region:rollup2
NOT ALL BREAST PUMPS ARE

02:02:13.026 --> 02:02:18.331 region:rollup2

WELL ITS A REASONABLE RATE

02:08:51.224 --> 02:08:54.327 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:56.329 region:rollup2
.

02:08:54.327 --> 02:09:00.132 region:rollup2
IT WAS DONE WITH SOME COMPLEXITY

02:08:56.329 --> 02:09:01.801 region:rollup2
OF LOOKING AT MEDI CAL A THEM

02:09:00.132 --> 02:09:03.402 region:rollup2
THE MOUND OF WOMEN IN MEDI CAL

IS GOING TO NEED A PUMP IT

02:09:09.442 --> 02:09:12.645 region:rollup2
LOOKED ABOUT HALF OF THE WOMEN

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:14.380 region:rollup2
NEEDING A PUMP.

02:09:12.645 --> 02:09:15.948 region:rollup2
WHO ARE BREASTFEEDING FOR A

02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:17.450 region:rollup2
LONGER TERM BECAUSE THEY PUBLIC

02:09:15.948 --> 02:09:18.985 region:rollup2
PROBABLY RELYING ON THE PUMP

02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:22.622 region:rollup2
THAT GOING BACK TO WORK?

02:09:18.985 --> 02:09:25.157 region:rollup2
AND. ALSO LOOKING AT A A A

02:09:22.622 --> 02:09:26.792 region:rollup2
PERCENT SOMEONE ELSE. COULD DID

02:09:25.157 --> 02:09:28.527 region:rollup2
THIS ANALYSIS FOR US ARE TRYING

02:09:26.792 --> 02:09:29.495 region:rollup2
TO EXPLAIN IN THAT WAY. IT DOES

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:33.032 region:rollup2
PRO IT'S.

02:09:29.495 --> 02:09:35.301 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED AT.

02:09:33.032 --> 02:09:37.169 region:rollup2
A PROVIA BUZZ THE NUMBER OF

02:09:35.301 --> 02:09:38.904 region:rollup2
WOMEN WHO ARE GOING TO NEED A

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:41.307 region:rollup2
PUMP AT A HIGHER RATE THEM.

02:09:38.904 --> 02:09:43.576 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WHO ACTUALLY WILL NEED

02:09:41.307 --> 02:09:45.044 region:rollup2
A PUMP BUT THE WAIT WAS

02:09:43.576 --> 02:09:46.712 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED WAS USING.

02:09:45.044 --> 02:09:48.014 region:rollup2
TOM THEN AMOUNT OF WOMEN ON

02:09:46.712 --> 02:09:49.982 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ALL IN THE LOOKING AT

02:09:48.014 --> 02:09:52.351 region:rollup2
FIFTY PERCENT MEDIAN THAT THAT

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:54.387 region:rollup2
PUMP. AND THEN THE THREE MONTH

02:09:52.351 --> 02:09:55.921 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING GREAT SO

02:09:54.387 --> 02:09:58.924 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW IT WAS DETERMINED.

02:09:55.921 --> 02:10:01.460 region:rollup2
WE ALSO LOOKED AT WHAT THE

02:09:58.924 --> 02:10:04.096 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATE OF PUMPS.

02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:06.265 region:rollup2
ARE OF IN OTHER STATES IN SO

02:10:04.096 --> 02:10:09.335 region:rollup2
THIS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE

02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:11.904 region:rollup2
INCREASE IS BASED ON AN AVERAGE

02:10:09.335 --> 02:10:13.472 region:rollup2
OF FIVE OTHER STATES WHO HAVE

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:15.708 region:rollup2
MUCH HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES.

02:10:13.472 --> 02:10:16.842 region:rollup2
THAN CALIFORNIA DOES IN SO WE

02:10:15.708 --> 02:10:18.477 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S QUITE REASONABLE.

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:21.447 region:rollup2
.

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:23.549 region:rollup2

ALSO EQUIPMENT.

02:10:34.093 --> 02:10:39.131 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD ONLY COST.

02:10:37.797 --> 02:10:42.435 region:rollup2
NOW LISTEN TO DOLLARS LIKE A

02:10:39.131 --> 02:10:44.503 region:rollup2
DOLLAR NINETEEN PER PER.

02:10:42.435 --> 02:10:46.372 region:rollup2

RECENT STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE

02:20:03.962 --> 02:20:06.698 region:rollup2

THE WAY WE SEE IT FOOT SCREENING

02:20:43.035 --> 02:20:47.239 region:rollup2

THAT YOUR DOCTOR WOULD CALL THE

COME AND SEE THE PATIENT AND

02:21:05.991 --> 02:21:08.927 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE CARE THAT IS NEEDED.

02:21:07.292 --> 02:21:10.329 region:rollup2
IN A LOT OF THESE CASES WHEN THE

TO INFECT THE BONE.

02:21:16.435 --> 02:21:19.438 region:rollup2
AND SO THE ONLY THING THAT CAN

02:21:17.302 --> 02:21:20.439 region:rollup2
BE DONE IS TO ACTIVATE THE FOOT

02:21:19.438 --> 02:21:21.740 region:rollup2
OR TO TOAST.

02:21:20.439 --> 02:21:22.941 region:rollup2
AND SUCH WOULD INFECTIONS A

02:21:21.740 --> 02:21:24.776 region:rollup2
LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATIONS

02:21:22.941 --> 02:21:26.311 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF THE

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:28.580 region:rollup2
PATIENTS BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT

02:21:26.311 --> 02:21:29.948 region:rollup2
THE VERY PORTANT OUT PATIENT

LIMITED.

02:21:36.054 --> 02:21:39.591 region:rollup2
AND LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATION

02:21:37.856 --> 02:21:41.026 region:rollup2
RATE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE

02:21:39.591 --> 02:21:42.194 region:rollup2
LIVING OF COURSE THE LOSS OF

02:21:43.528 --> 02:21:46.932 region:rollup2
THAT'S MAKING IT MORE COSTLY FOR

THE STATE.

02:21:46.932 --> 02:21:50.936 region:rollup2

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:01.519 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT MAKING A MODEST

02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:03.120 region:rollup2
ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF FIVE

02:36:01.519 --> 02:36:04.255 region:rollup2

THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR PROVIDERS

02:39:27.691 --> 02:39:30.361 region:rollup2
AS THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:39:28.893 --> 02:39:31.929 region:rollup2
MUCH THE OVERPAYMENT MIGHT BE ON

02:39:30.361 --> 02:39:33.197 region:rollup2

THEY NEED. WHEN THEY NEED IT.

02:42:35.346 --> 02:42:39.016 region:rollup2
SO IF CONSUMERS DON'T GET TIMELY

DICK THE COST OF CARE GOES UP

02:42:47.992 --> 02:42:51.128 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN ONLY EXPENSIVE

ALTERNATIVES REMAIN?

02:42:51.128 --> 02:42:53.797 region:rollup2

02:42:55.199 --> 02:42:58.869 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE AND INEFFICIENT STUDY

02:42:56.967 --> 02:43:00.371 region:rollup2

REVEAL YOU KNOW THAT VERY WELL.

02:43:00.371 --> 02:43:02.706 region:rollup2

CONSUMERS DIE WAIT TO SEE A

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:08.078 region:rollup2

02:43:44.081 --> 02:43:46.684 region:rollup2
THE STRUGGLE TO CHECK CONSUMERS

02:43:46.684 --> 02:43:50.087 region:rollup2
GONE ON FOR OVER FOUR DECADES.

02:43:48.719 --> 02:43:52.122 region:rollup2
THE CONCEPT OF TIMELY ACCESS WAS

02:43:50.087 --> 02:43:53.991 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF THE

02:43:52.122 --> 02:43:55.492 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL KNOCKS CAN ACT WHICH

REQUIRES.

02:44:04.668 --> 02:44:08.872 region:rollup2

GOOD PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE.

02:44:19.683 --> 02:44:22.519 region:rollup2
FOR MANY YEARS EACH HEALTH PLAN

02:44:21.352 --> 02:44:24.421 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED ITS OWN INTERNAL

02:44:22.519 --> 02:44:26.123 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES FOR WHAT TIMELY

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:28.225 region:rollup2

FIVE TO THE NINETEEN NINETIES

02:44:31.995 --> 02:44:35.065 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF ATTENTION TO

02:44:33.397 --> 02:44:37.468 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON HEALTH PLANS IMPROPERLY

02:44:35.065 --> 02:44:38.535 region:rollup2
DENYING CARE OR DELAYED CARE.

02:44:37.468 --> 02:44:40.137 region:rollup2
THE SUSPICION WITH THE HEALTH

02:44:38.535 --> 02:44:41.839 region:rollup2
PLANS WERE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH

02:44:40.137 --> 02:44:43.774 region:rollup2

02:44:41.839 --> 02:44:44.975 region:rollup2
CONTRACTING WITH FEW DOCTORS.

02:44:43.774 --> 02:44:46.276 region:rollup2
STUDIES AT THE TIME SHOWED THAT

02:44:44.975 --> 02:44:48.445 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS HAVE TO WAIT MONTHS TO

BILLS.

02:44:57.488 --> 02:44:59.523 region:rollup2
THE FIGHT FOR THESE PROTECTION

02:44:58.956 --> 02:45:01.325 region:rollup2
STARTED DURING THE WILSON

02:44:59.523 --> 02:45:03.427 region:rollup2

WE HAVE HOPE THAT AT THE TIME

02:45:31.155 --> 02:45:34.091 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD BE SPECIFIC

02:45:32.022 --> 02:45:35.592 region:rollup2
STANDARDS FOR TIMELY ACCESS.

02:45:34.091 --> 02:45:36.660 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT WAS PART THE

02:46:28.579 --> 02:46:31.048 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

02:46:29.980 --> 02:46:32.382 region:rollup2
AND THOSE STANDARDS ARE WHAT WE

02:46:31.048 --> 02:46:33.584 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT TODAY.

02:46:32.382 --> 02:46:35.085 region:rollup2
IT FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO GET AN

02:46:33.584 --> 02:46:36.987 region:rollup2
URGENT CARE APPOINTMENT TEN

02:46:35.085 --> 02:46:38.422 region:rollup2
BUSINESS DAYS FOR PRIMARY CARE

02:46:36.987 --> 02:46:40.090 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE HEALTH APPOINTMENT AND

A SPECIAL VISIT AND FIFTEEN.

02:46:40.090 --> 02:46:43.560 region:rollup2
DAYS.

02:46:41.892 --> 02:46:45.162 region:rollup2
THESE THE LOS IT'S TIME LIMIT ON

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:45.829 region:rollup2
HOW LONG PATIENTS HAVE TO WAIT

02:46:45.162 --> 02:46:47.464 region:rollup2
AND THE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN IN

02:46:45.829 --> 02:46:48.165 region:rollup2

TOUCH.

02:46:48.165 --> 02:46:51.134 region:rollup2
SO GOING BACK

02:46:50.167 --> 02:46:52.569 region:rollup2
TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION HOW

02:46:51.134 --> 02:46:54.371 region:rollup2
LONG OF THE CONSUMER HAVE TO

02:46:52.569 --> 02:46:55.706 region:rollup2
WAIT FOR A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

02:46:54.371 --> 02:46:56.807 region:rollup2
NO NOW THAT WE HAVE CLEAR

02:46:55.706 --> 02:46:58.308 region:rollup2
STANDARDS IN PLACE HOW DO WE

02:46:56.807 --> 02:46:59.676 region:rollup2
KNOW IF THE HEALTH PLANS ARE

02:46:58.308 --> 02:47:01.745 region:rollup2
MEETING THEM.

02:46:59.676 --> 02:47:02.613 region:rollup2
THE TWO THOUSAND THREE BILL THAT

02:47:01.745 --> 02:47:03.881 region:rollup2
REQUIRED YOU MAY SEE TO SET THE

02:47:02.613 --> 02:47:05.749 region:rollup2
STEP CREATE THE STANDARDS ALSO

02:47:03.881 --> 02:47:07.584 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THEM TO REVIEW HEALTH

02:47:05.749 --> 02:47:09.586 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT WORKS EVERY YEAR.

02:47:07.584 --> 02:47:10.921 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE DURING THE AND THE

02:47:09.586 --> 02:47:12.589 region:rollup2

02:47:10.921 --> 02:47:13.590 region:rollup2
WORK AGAIN ALLOWED TO USE

02:47:12.589 --> 02:47:15.092 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT METRICS AND APPROACHES

02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:15.559 region:rollup2
FOR DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WHICH

02:47:15.092 --> 02:47:17.761 region:rollup2
MADE ENFORCEMENT QUITE

02:47:15.559 --> 02:47:19.530 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

02:47:17.761 --> 02:47:20.664 region:rollup2
SO TWENTY FOURTEEN HEALTH ACT

02:47:19.530 --> 02:47:22.766 region:rollup2
THE SPONSOR S. B. NINE SIXTY

02:47:20.664 --> 02:47:23.967 region:rollup2
FOUR WHICH STANDARDIZES THE DATA

02:47:22.766 --> 02:47:25.369 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE TO REPORT

02:47:23.967 --> 02:47:26.970 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR REGARDING NETWORK

02:47:25.369 --> 02:47:29.172 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY. AND REQUIRED YOU WOULD

02:47:26.970 --> 02:47:29.806 region:rollup2
SEE TO DOUBLE THE PROCESS TO

02:47:29.172 --> 02:47:30.941 region:rollup2
MEASURE WHETHER HEALTH PLANS IN

02:47:29.806 --> 02:47:31.575 region:rollup2
MEETING THESE.

02:47:30.941 --> 02:47:32.409 region:rollup2
TIMELY ACCESS INTO THAT WE HAVE

02:47:31.575 --> 02:47:33.210 region:rollup2
A LOT.

02:47:32.409 --> 02:47:35.012 region:rollup2
WE SPONSORED THE SPELL FOR TWO

02:47:33.210 --> 02:47:36.713 region:rollup2
REASONS.

02:47:35.012 --> 02:47:37.981 region:rollup2
FIRST WE NEEDED TO SEE PROOF

02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:39.349 region:rollup2
THAT HEALTH PLANS ROUGHLY

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:41.151 region:rollup2
PROVIDING TIMELY ACCESS.

02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:42.419 region:rollup2
AND SECOND MILLION MORE MILLIONS

02:47:41.151 --> 02:47:43.654 region:rollup2
MORE CALIFORNIA'S REGAINING

02:47:42.419 --> 02:47:45.055 region:rollup2
COVERAGE THANKS TO THE

02:47:43.654 --> 02:47:45.789 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEY

02:47:45.055 --> 02:47:47.190 region:rollup2
WERE AND ROLLING EITHER

02:47:45.789 --> 02:47:48.759 region:rollup2
UNCOVERED CALIFORNIA PLANTS ARE

02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:49.660 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND

02:47:48.759 --> 02:47:51.628 region:rollup2
AS MORE PEOPLE ENROLL THERE WERE

02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:52.863 region:rollup2
PERSISTENT CONCERNS ABOUT

02:47:51.628 --> 02:47:54.331 region:rollup2
WHETHER NETWORKS WERE ADEQUATE.

02:47:52.863 --> 02:47:55.399 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME MILLIONS OF

02:47:54.331 --> 02:47:56.867 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND MEDI CAL HAD BEEN

02:47:55.399 --> 02:47:58.468 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONED INTO MANAGED CARE

02:47:56.867 --> 02:47:59.836 region:rollup2
FROM FEE FOR SERVICE WE WANT TO

02:47:58.468 --> 02:48:01.104 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS A MEDI

02:47:59.836 --> 02:48:03.240 region:rollup2
CAL MANAGE CARE. WE'RE GETTING

02:48:01.104 --> 02:48:04.541 region:rollup2
THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT OTHER

02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:05.809 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS WERE GETTING.

02:48:04.541 --> 02:48:07.244 region:rollup2
SO UNDER S. B. NINE SIXTY FOUR

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:08.779 region:rollup2
AT THE HEALTH PLAN USES A

02:48:07.244 --> 02:48:10.480 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT NETWORK FOR MEDI CAL

02:48:08.779 --> 02:48:11.682 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE THAT FOR OTHERWISE

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:13.850 region:rollup2
BUSINESS THEY HAVE TO SEPARATE

02:48:11.682 --> 02:48:15.886 region:rollup2
ANNUAL REVIEW. FOR TIMELY ACCESS

02:48:13.850 --> 02:48:17.054 region:rollup2
ACCESS THE NETWORK AT SEA FOR

02:48:15.886 --> 02:48:18.021 region:rollup2
THE MEDI CAL NETWORK.

02:48:17.054 --> 02:48:19.823 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO

02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:21.258 region:rollup2
SUBMIT THE SAME INFORMATION ON

02:48:19.823 --> 02:48:23.093 region:rollup2
THAT WORKS TO BOTH THE IMAGE THE

02:48:21.258 --> 02:48:23.327 region:rollup2
NTSC US OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT

02:48:23.093 --> 02:48:26.129 region:rollup2
CHECK.

02:48:23.327 --> 02:48:28.065 region:rollup2
AND CHECK FOR INCONSISTENCIES.

02:48:26.129 --> 02:48:29.900 region:rollup2
SO HOW LONG THE CONSUMER HAVE TO

02:48:28.065 --> 02:48:31.535 region:rollup2
WAIT FOR DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS.

02:48:29.900 --> 02:48:33.170 region:rollup2
SO FAR HEALTH PLANS HAVE FILED

02:48:31.535 --> 02:48:34.705 region:rollup2
TIMELY ACTS OF PORTS FOR TWO

02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:36.106 region:rollup2
YEARS WITH A STANDARDIZED DATA

02:48:34.705 --> 02:48:37.507 region:rollup2
THAT WAS REQUIRED BY SB NINE

02:48:36.106 --> 02:48:39.142 region:rollup2
SIXTY FOUR.

02:48:37.507 --> 02:48:40.877 region:rollup2
THE FIRST YEAR OF DATA BASED ON

02:48:39.142 --> 02:48:42.446 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH RENTAL WITH

02:48:40.877 --> 02:48:43.647 region:rollup2
SO MANY ERRORS THAT THE IN WHICH

02:48:42.446 --> 02:48:44.848 region:rollup2
HE WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE

02:48:43.647 --> 02:48:46.350 region:rollup2
WHETHER HEALTH PLANS WERE

02:48:44.848 --> 02:48:47.184 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MEETING THE STANDARDS.

02:48:46.350 --> 02:48:48.685 region:rollup2
DO YOU WHICH YOU JUST RELEASED

02:48:47.184 --> 02:48:49.920 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TIMELY ACCESS

02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:54.157 region:rollup2
HEARING FROM THEM. ABOUT THE

02:48:52.556 --> 02:48:55.058 region:rollup2
FINDINGS AND IN THE NEXT PANEL.

02:48:54.157 --> 02:48:56.293 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S SOMETHING ILL

02:48:55.058 --> 02:48:57.327 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S TIGHTLY AFTER

02:48:56.293 --> 02:48:58.295 region:rollup2
STANDARDS ARE THE STRONGEST

02:48:57.327 --> 02:48:59.363 region:rollup2
NATION.

02:48:58.295 --> 02:49:01.365 region:rollup2
THEY APPLY TO BOTH THE MAKES

02:48:59.363 --> 02:49:03.100 region:rollup2
THE PLANS OUT AND MEDI CAL

02:49:01.365 --> 02:49:04.101 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THE A TF

CORPORATE THESE REQUIREMENTS

02:49:04.101 --> 02:49:07.137 region:rollup2
INTO THE CONTRACT WITH MEDI CAL

02:49:05.936 --> 02:49:08.071 region:rollup2
PLANS.

02:49:07.137 --> 02:49:10.040 region:rollup2
D. H. YES ALSO DOES ITS OWN

02:49:08.071 --> 02:49:11.208 region:rollup2
MONITORING OF TIMELY ACCESS AND

02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:12.509 region:rollup2
PER THE FEDERAL MANAGE CARE

02:49:11.208 --> 02:49:14.111 region:rollup2
FINAL RULE.

02:49:12.509 --> 02:49:15.679 region:rollup2
ITSELF A FOR DOING ANNUAL

02:49:14.111 --> 02:49:16.947 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATIONS OF HEALTH PLAN

02:49:15.679 --> 02:49:18.482 region:rollup2
THAT WORKS WITH WELL.

02:49:16.947 --> 02:49:19.716 region:rollup2
WE DO CONSISTENT YOU TO STRUGGLE

02:49:18.482 --> 02:49:22.019 region:rollup2
OF KNOWING WHETHER HEALTH PLANS

02:49:19.716 --> 02:49:22.853 region:rollup2
ARE MEETING THE STANDARDS.

02:49:22.019 --> 02:49:24.154 region:rollup2
THE STANDARDIZED DATA AND

02:49:22.853 --> 02:49:26.123 region:rollup2
REPORTING OF S. B. NIGHT SIXTY

02:49:24.154 --> 02:49:27.457 region:rollup2
FOUR IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW

02:49:26.123 --> 02:49:29.292 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AS I SHOULD HAVE SHARED

02:49:27.457 --> 02:49:30.527 region:rollup2
WITH YOU. HEALTH PLANS HAVE BEEN

02:49:29.292 --> 02:49:31.895 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TIMELY

02:49:30.527 --> 02:49:33.296 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE SINCE NINETEEN

02:49:31.895 --> 02:49:34.665 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE AND WE'RE STILL

02:49:33.296 --> 02:49:35.666 region:rollup2
WAITING FOR THEM TO SHOW THAT

02:49:34.665 --> 02:49:37.134 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT MAKING CONSUMERS

02:49:35.666 --> 02:49:38.735 region:rollup2
WAIT TOO LONG FOR DOCTORS

02:49:37.134 --> 02:49:40.203 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENTS.

02:49:38.735 --> 02:49:42.172 region:rollup2
AND WHAT PLAN PROVIDERS.

02:49:40.203 --> 02:49:43.573 region:rollup2
DID UPRIGHT BY TIMELY ACCESS TO

02:49:42.172 --> 02:49:44.908 region:rollup2
CARE IT OUGHT TO MATH OTHER

02:49:43.573 --> 02:49:47.010 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS SUCH AS INADEQUATE

02:49:44.908 --> 02:49:48.879 region:rollup2
PROVIDER NETWORKS OR FINANCIAL

02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:49.479 region:rollup2
INSOLVENCY.

02:49:48.879 --> 02:49:50.814 region:rollup2
SO GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:52.249 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:49:50.814 --> 02:49:53.016 region:rollup2
HOW LONG DOES THE CONSUMER HAVE

02:49:52.249 --> 02:49:54.551 region:rollup2
TO WAIT FOR A DOCTOR'S

02:49:53.016 --> 02:49:56.653 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT THE STANDARD SAY

02:49:54.551 --> 02:49:58.121 region:rollup2
FORTY HOURS FOR URGENT CARE TEN

02:49:56.653 --> 02:49:59.389 region:rollup2
BUSINESS DAYS FOR PRIMARY CARE

02:49:58.121 --> 02:50:00.991 region:rollup2
OR MENTAL HEALTH? FIFTEEN DAYS

02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:02.426 region:rollup2
FOR SPECIALIST BUT WE'RE STILL

02:50:00.991 --> 02:50:03.760 region:rollup2
WAITING FOR PROOF THAT THIS IS

02:50:02.426 --> 02:50:04.061 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND WILL LIFE

02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:06.897 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:50:04.061 --> 02:50:07.698 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:50:06.897 --> 02:50:08.899 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST KIMBERLY

CHEN OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN

02:50:08.899 --> 02:50:11.768 region:rollup2
ETHNIC HELP WORK HEALTH NETWORK

02:50:10.467 --> 02:50:12.836 region:rollup2
WAS STATE WHAT HEALTH ADVOCACY

02:50:11.768 --> 02:50:14.504 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO

02:50:12.836 --> 02:50:15.138 region:rollup2
ADVANCING HEALTH EQUITY IN

02:50:14.504 --> 02:50:17.240 region:rollup2
REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES NO

02:50:15.138 --> 02:50:18.341 region:rollup2
WANNA. BUILD ON THE BACKGROUND

02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:19.609 region:rollup2
AND FOUNDATION LAID BY MY

02:50:18.341 --> 02:50:21.011 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE HERE AND SPEAK TO THE

02:50:19.609 --> 02:50:22.712 region:rollup2
IMPACTS THAT CULTURAL AND

02:50:21.011 --> 02:50:23.713 region:rollup2
LINGUISTIC ACCESS HAVE.

02:50:22.712 --> 02:50:25.115 region:rollup2
TICKET ACCESS TO CARE

02:50:23.713 --> 02:50:27.017 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY I'LL BE TOUCHING ON

02:50:25.115 --> 02:50:28.518 region:rollup2
TWO POINTS LANGUAGE ACCESS AND

02:50:27.017 --> 02:50:30.253 region:rollup2
TIMELY UP TIMELY ACCESS

02:50:28.518 --> 02:50:32.456 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND WHAT GOES INTO

02:50:30.253 --> 02:50:33.323 region:rollup2
ENSURING A NETWORK ACTUALLY

02:50:32.456 --> 02:50:33.924 region:rollup2
MEETS THE NEEDS A BENEFICIARY.

02:50:33.323 --> 02:50:35.125 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO START

02:50:33.924 --> 02:50:36.693 region:rollup2
WITH SOME FACTS WE KNOW THAT

02:50:35.125 --> 02:50:37.928 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF MEDI

02:50:36.693 --> 02:50:39.329 region:rollup2
CAL AND RELEASE ARE PEOPLE OF

02:50:37.928 --> 02:50:40.564 region:rollup2
COLOR AND ONE THIRD ARE LIMITED

02:50:39.329 --> 02:50:41.865 region:rollup2
ENGLISH PROFICIENT.

02:50:40.564 --> 02:50:43.100 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS TO SAY THAT CULTURAL

02:50:41.865 --> 02:50:44.835 region:rollup2
LINGUISTIC ACCESS IS NOT JUST

02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:46.236 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS LAID ON

02:50:44.835 --> 02:50:47.504 region:rollup2
TOP IT IS A CENTRAL FACT WHETHER

02:50:46.236 --> 02:50:48.872 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

02:50:47.504 --> 02:50:50.173 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MEANS BEING ABLE TO SEE

02:50:48.872 --> 02:50:51.775 region:rollup2
YOUR DOCTOR AT YOUR TREATMENT

02:50:50.173 --> 02:50:53.043 region:rollup2
REGIMENS AND ULTIMATELY

02:50:51.775 --> 02:50:54.411 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OPTIMAL HEALTH

02:50:53.043 --> 02:50:55.746 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

02:50:54.411 --> 02:50:56.813 region:rollup2
THEREFORE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK

02:50:55.746 --> 02:50:58.048 region:rollup2
MUST BE ONE THAT SERVES THE

02:50:56.813 --> 02:50:59.516 region:rollup2
CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS OF

02:50:58.048 --> 02:51:00.584 region:rollup2
THE BENEFICIARIES.

02:50:59.516 --> 02:51:01.985 region:rollup2
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT LANGUAGE

02:51:00.584 --> 02:51:03.587 region:rollup2
ACCESS IN TIMELY ACCESS

02:51:01.985 --> 02:51:04.721 region:rollup2
STANDARDS WHAT IS A LOSSY.

02:51:03.587 --> 02:51:06.089 region:rollup2
MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE

02:51:04.721 --> 02:51:06.656 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ORAL

02:51:06.089 --> 02:51:08.492 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION AT ALL POINTS

02:51:06.656 --> 02:51:09.526 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

TIMELY ACCESS MONITORING.

03:03:12.582 --> 03:03:14.884 region:rollup2
D. H. CS HASN'T REALLY MEANT

03:03:13.683 --> 03:03:16.586 region:rollup2

03:03:33.870 --> 03:03:37.139 region:rollup2
TELEHEALTH IS PLAYING A BIGGER

03:03:35.571 --> 03:03:38.808 region:rollup2
AND BIGGER PART IN OUR DELIVERY

WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT.

03:04:12.875 --> 03:04:16.345 region:rollup2

IMPORTANT AND RURAL AREAS.

03:04:24.287 --> 03:04:26.556 region:rollup2
THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS

03:04:25.521 --> 03:04:28.090 region:rollup2

03:07:07.883 --> 03:07:14.090 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES.

03:07:08.818 --> 03:07:15.057 region:rollup2
SORE.

03:07:14.090 --> 03:07:16.525 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO INADEQUATE

03:07:15.057 --> 03:07:18.160 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OF PLANS BY STATE

03:07:16.525 --> 03:07:19.295 region:rollup2
REGULATORS.

03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:21.330 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION WITH CENTER MATT

03:07:19.295 --> 03:07:22.965 region:rollup2
WAS A CLEAR EXAMPLE THE STATE'S

03:07:21.330 --> 03:07:24.467 region:rollup2
LACK OF OVERSIGHT IN THIS AREA.

03:07:22.965 --> 03:07:26.001 region:rollup2
TMA HAS A LONGSTANDING POSITION

03:07:24.467 --> 03:07:27.837 region:rollup2
OPPOSING THE USE OF THESE TYPES

03:07:26.001 --> 03:07:29.538 region:rollup2
OF NARAL NETWORKS AND OPPOSES

03:07:27.837 --> 03:07:31.373 region:rollup2
THESE TYPES OF ACTIONS BY PLANS

03:07:29.538 --> 03:07:32.842 region:rollup2
AND DELEGATED GROUPS TO LIMIT

03:07:31.373 --> 03:07:34.076 region:rollup2
PATIENT ACCESS TO CARE.

03:07:32.842 --> 03:07:35.578 region:rollup2
IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE STATE

03:07:34.076 --> 03:07:38.114 region:rollup2
ACT TO REFORM THE CURRENT SYSTEM

03:07:35.578 --> 03:07:39.215 region:rollup2
OF MONITORING CONTRACTED PLANS.

03:07:38.114 --> 03:07:40.783 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY DATA SHOULD BE

03:07:39.215 --> 03:07:42.184 region:rollup2
REVIEWED AND VERIFIED ACROSS

03:07:40.783 --> 03:07:44.620 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES AND

03:07:42.184 --> 03:07:46.355 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

03:07:44.620 --> 03:07:46.889 region:rollup2
JCS HAVE RELIED HEAVILY ON PLAN

03:07:46.355 --> 03:07:48.958 region:rollup2
SELF REPORTING TO MONITOR

03:07:46.889 --> 03:07:50.659 region:rollup2

03:07:48.958 --> 03:07:52.461 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS HAVE LONG CONTENDED

03:07:50.659 --> 03:07:53.729 region:rollup2
THIS METHOD WITH INADEQUATE. AND

03:07:52.461 --> 03:07:55.197 region:rollup2
IT DATES YES FOR TIGHTENING

03:07:53.729 --> 03:07:57.666 region:rollup2
MONITORING OF MANAGED CARE PLANS

03:07:55.197 --> 03:07:58.234 region:rollup2
AND NOT RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON DATA

03:07:57.666 --> 03:08:00.269 region:rollup2
PROVIDED DIRECTLY BY HEALTH

03:07:58.234 --> 03:08:01.337 region:rollup2

03:08:00.269 --> 03:08:02.671 region:rollup2
A CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S

03:08:01.337 --> 03:08:04.306 region:rollup2
REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE ACS

03:08:02.671 --> 03:08:06.008 region:rollup2

NETWORK DATA RECEIVED WHO HEALTH

03:08:06.008 --> 03:08:09.078 region:rollup2
PLANS WITH ACCURATE.

03:08:07.643 --> 03:08:09.945 region:rollup2
THERE BY FAILING TO ENSURE THAT

03:08:09.078 --> 03:08:11.447 region:rollup2
THE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAD

03:08:09.945 --> 03:08:14.550 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE NETWORKS OF PROVIDERS

03:08:11.447 --> 03:08:15.818 region:rollup2
TO SERVE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES.

03:08:14.550 --> 03:08:17.286 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE PLANS MUST BE HELD

03:08:15.818 --> 03:08:19.021 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAINTAINING

03:08:17.286 --> 03:08:19.922 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE NETWORKS AND ENSURING

03:08:19.021 --> 03:08:21.690 region:rollup2
THAT MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES

03:08:19.922 --> 03:08:23.225 region:rollup2
RECEIVE. THE SAME QUALITY

03:08:21.690 --> 03:08:25.161 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE THAT NON MEDICAL

03:08:23.225 --> 03:08:26.729 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE.

03:08:25.161 --> 03:08:28.264 region:rollup2
WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWO OH

SUPPORTED THE GROUNDWORK WITH

03:08:30.366 --> 03:08:33.235 region:rollup2
WAS LATE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

03:08:32.368 --> 03:08:34.837 region:rollup2
HOWEVER TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

03:08:33.235 --> 03:08:36.005 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS IS SUCCESSFUL THE

03:08:34.837 --> 03:08:37.339 region:rollup2
STATE MUST BE WILLING TO MAKE

03:08:36.005 --> 03:08:38.908 region:rollup2
LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN THE

03:08:37.339 --> 03:08:40.209 region:rollup2
PROVIDER NETWORK. ENGAGE IN

03:08:38.908 --> 03:08:41.210 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT OF MANAGED

CARE PLANS.

03:08:41.210 --> 03:08:44.313 region:rollup2
AND ESTABLISH A HIGHER DEGREE OF

03:08:42.545 --> 03:08:46.015 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY BY ENSURING THAT

03:08:44.313 --> 03:08:47.283 region:rollup2
DATA ON PLAN COMPLIANCE AND

03:08:46.015 --> 03:08:48.884 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS ARE

03:08:47.283 --> 03:08:50.219 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN A TIMELY

03:08:48.884 --> 03:08:51.520 region:rollup2

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES.

03:09:06.268 --> 03:09:11.140 region:rollup2
FINDING AN ONCOLOGIST TO REFER

THEIR MEDICAL CONDITION MAYBE.

03:11:52.401 --> 03:11:55.838 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES AN ACCESS

03:11:53.902 --> 03:11:57.072 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT COULD COME IN AS A

03:11:55.838 --> 03:11:58.674 region:rollup2
CONSUMER WENT TO AN OUT OF

CONSUMERS THAT MAYBE HAVE TOLD

03:12:09.385 --> 03:12:12.755 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO GO TOO FAR AND IT'S

03:12:10.919 --> 03:12:14.390 region:rollup2
BEYOND A REASONABLE DISTANCE TO

03:12:12.755 --> 03:12:15.657 region:rollup2

THE DAY THE HEALTH PLAN IS NOT

03:12:29.872 --> 03:12:33.075 region:rollup2

ANOTHER KIND OF ACCESS TYPE

TO COMPARE HEALTH PLAN DATA

03:14:22.284 --> 03:14:25.687 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE DATA ELEVATOR.

03:14:24.253 --> 03:14:27.489 region:rollup2
DATA ERRORS THAT WERE DISCUSSED.

03:14:25.687 --> 03:14:28.524 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE

03:14:27.489 --> 03:14:30.158 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT WHICH

03:14:28.524 --> 03:14:31.426 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAID WE HAVE NOTHING

03:14:30.158 --> 03:14:33.228 region:rollup2
TO REPORT BECAUSE WE CAN'T

03:14:31.426 --> 03:14:34.596 region:rollup2

03:14:33.228 --> 03:14:36.765 region:rollup2
TO TAKE UP OF THE PLANTS TAKE A

03:14:34.596 --> 03:14:39.067 region:rollup2
NUMBE OF STEPS TO IMPROVE THE

03:14:36.765 --> 03:14:40.035 region:rollup2
THOUGH CHANCES OF A. DEAL THAT

03:14:39.067 --> 03:14:41.503 region:rollup2
WE CAN REPORT THE SHARE.

03:14:40.035 --> 03:14:43.138 region:rollup2
NATE THESE STEPS INCLUDED

03:14:41.503 --> 03:14:44.406 region:rollup2
RETAINING DATA VALIDATORS TO

03:14:43.138 --> 03:14:45.574 region:rollup2
REVIEW AND AUTHENTICATE THE

03:14:44.406 --> 03:14:47.709 region:rollup2
TIMELY ACCESS DATA BEFORE THEY

03:14:45.574 --> 03:14:48.277 region:rollup2
SUBMIT THEIR TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

03:14:47.709 --> 03:14:50.546 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN COMPLAINTS

03:14:48.277 --> 03:14:51.747 region:rollup2
REPORTS. SO THE INFORMATION WE

03:14:50.546 --> 03:14:53.382 region:rollup2
GOT FOR THE TWENTY SIX

03:14:51.747 --> 03:14:54.383 region:rollup2
STEEN MEASUREMENT HERE WHICH WAS

03:14:53.382 --> 03:14:56.785 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED IN MARCH OF TWENTY

03:14:54.383 --> 03:14:58.086 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN HAD FAR FEWER ERRORS

03:14:56.785 --> 03:14:59.555 region:rollup2
THAT WE WE MADE A LOT OF

03:14:58.086 --> 03:15:01.523 region:rollup2
PROGRESS FROM WHAT WE SAW THE

03:14:59.555 --> 03:15:02.157 region:rollup2
YEAR BEFORE. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE

03:15:01.523 --> 03:15:04.092 region:rollup2
NOT ALL THE WAY TO THE FINISH

03:15:02.157 --> 03:15:05.627 region:rollup2
LINE AND PART OF THAT REASON IS

03:15:04.092 --> 03:15:06.929 region:rollup2
BY THE TIME WE REALIZED WE HAD

03:15:05.627 --> 03:15:07.829 region:rollup2
SO MANY ERRORS IN THE TWENTY

03:15:06.929 --> 03:15:09.965 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN.

03:15:07.829 --> 03:15:11.767 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENT YEAR A LOT OF THE

03:15:09.965 --> 03:15:13.802 region:rollup2
SURVEYS FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN HAD

03:15:11.767 --> 03:15:15.170 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN CONDUCTED SO TO THE

03:15:13.802 --> 03:15:17.139 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT THOSE SURVEYS WORDY

03:15:15.170 --> 03:15:18.040 region:rollup2
DON THAT COULDN'T BE REDONE. AND

03:15:17.139 --> 03:15:19.541 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WERE NOW IN TWENTY

03:15:18.040 --> 03:15:21.443 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN BY THE TIME THAT WAS

03:15:19.541 --> 03:15:23.478 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DISCOVERED AND SO WE

03:15:21.443 --> 03:15:25.781 region:rollup2
HAD TO WORK WITH THE SURVEYS.

03:15:23.478 --> 03:15:26.615 region:rollup2
THAT WERE DONE AND WE CAN ONLY

03:15:25.781 --> 03:15:27.816 region:rollup2
WE CAN ONLY ADDRESS THE DATA

03:15:26.615 --> 03:15:28.850 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE COULD ADDRESS

03:15:27.816 --> 03:15:30.886 region:rollup2
AFTER THE FACT.

03:15:28.850 --> 03:15:33.255 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THE DATA FOR TWENTY

03:15:30.886 --> 03:15:34.690 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN HAD FAR FEWER ERRORS IN

03:15:33.255 --> 03:15:36.959 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS YEAR SOME REMAINED.

03:15:34.690 --> 03:15:38.360 region:rollup2
AND IN WE WORK WE MADE THE

03:15:36.959 --> 03:15:40.362 region:rollup2
DECISION TO ONLY PUBLISHED

03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:41.997 region:rollup2
CHARTS AND SUMMARY DATA WHERE WE

03:15:40.362 --> 03:15:43.131 region:rollup2
HAD A MARGIN OF ERROR OF LESS

03:15:41.997 --> 03:15:44.633 region:rollup2
THAN FIVE PERCENT.

03:15:43.131 --> 03:15:46.301 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE FELT STRONGLY THAT IF

03:15:44.633 --> 03:15:47.636 region:rollup2
WE PUBLISH DATA WITH A MARGIN OF

03:15:46.301 --> 03:15:49.037 region:rollup2
ERROR OF GREATER FIVE PERCENT

03:15:47.636 --> 03:15:50.672 region:rollup2
COULD BE WILDLY MISLEADING SO

03:15:49.037 --> 03:15:52.240 region:rollup2
WERE UNWILLING TO DO THAT. AND

03:15:50.672 --> 03:15:54.676 region:rollup2
FOR THAT REASON THAT WE DO NOT

03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:55.677 region:rollup2
HAVE BY ONE OF BUSINESS AS A ONE

03:15:54.676 --> 03:15:56.411 region:rollup2
OF THE PREVIOUS PANEL MEMBERS

03:15:55.677 --> 03:15:57.479 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE

03:15:56.411 --> 03:15:59.481 region:rollup2
TOWARDS RELATED TO LINE OF

03:15:57.479 --> 03:16:00.716 region:rollup2
BUSINESS BECAUSE ONCE. WE CARVE

03:15:59.481 --> 03:16:01.283 region:rollup2
TO THE INFORMATION INTO THAT

03:16:00.716 --> 03:16:04.920 region:rollup2
SMALL OF A BUCKET ARE DID IT

03:16:01.283 --> 03:16:07.256 region:rollup2
ARE.

03:16:04.920 --> 03:16:08.357 region:rollup2
ARE SIMPLY AREAS WERE GREATER

03:16:07.256 --> 03:16:10.225 region:rollup2
THAN FIVE PERCENT AND ALSO WHEN

03:16:08.357 --> 03:16:12.594 region:rollup2
WE WENT DOWN TO THE COUNTY LEVEL

03:16:10.225 --> 03:16:13.028 region:rollup2
OR SAMPLING ERRORS WERE GREATER

03:16:12.594 --> 03:16:13.662 region:rollup2
THAN FIVE PERCENT.

03:16:13.028 --> 03:16:14.763 region:rollup2
SO THE RATES OF COMPLAINTS FOR

03:16:13.662 --> 03:16:16.131 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENTS WITHIN THE TIME

03:16:14.763 --> 03:16:17.699 region:rollup2
LAPSED STANDARDS VERY PRETTY

03:16:16.131 --> 03:16:19.568 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY BY PLAN PROVIDER

03:16:17.699 --> 03:16:20.969 region:rollup2
TYPE AND THE STANDARD. BUT THE

03:16:19.568 --> 03:16:22.938 region:rollup2
TOTAL RANGE FOR FULL SERVICE

03:16:20.969 --> 03:16:24.806 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS ARE NOT TAKE INTO

03:16:22.938 --> 03:16:27.342 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT SPECIALIZED PLANS. OF A

03:16:24.806 --> 03:16:28.510 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS IN THE SAMPLE SIZE

03:16:27.342 --> 03:16:30.045 region:rollup2
MEETING THE APPOINTMENT RETAIN

STANDARD VARIED FROM A HIGH OF

NINETY FIVE PERCENT TO A LOW OF

03:16:31.546 --> 03:16:35.317 region:rollup2
THIRTY TWO PERCENT. SO WHAT THAT

03:16:33.315 --> 03:16:36.985 region:rollup2
MEANS IS FOR WHATEVER SAMPLE WAS

03:16:35.317 --> 03:16:39.187 region:rollup2
CALLED FOR THAT APPOINTMENT WAIT

03:16:36.985 --> 03:16:40.422 region:rollup2

PERCENT.

03:16:51.500 --> 03:16:53.769 region:rollup2
AND SO WE SINCE I ALREADY

03:16:52.734 --> 03:16:55.203 region:rollup2
MENTION WE DON'T HAVE COUNTY

03:16:53.769 --> 03:16:56.438 region:rollup2
LEVEL DATA IN THE REPORT I CAN

03:16:55.203 --> 03:16:58.106 region:rollup2
TALK GENERALLY ABOUT SOME OF THE

03:16:56.438 --> 03:16:59.374 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS RATES FOR PLANTS THAT

03:16:58.106 --> 03:17:01.476 region:rollup2
OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY IN THE

03:16:59.374 --> 03:17:02.277 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY. SO WON'T BE

03:17:01.476 --> 03:17:04.079 region:rollup2
FRESNO ALONE BUT IT WILL BE

03:17:02.277 --> 03:17:06.381 region:rollup2
AREAS. IN THE GREATER CENTRAL

03:17:04.079 --> 03:17:08.483 region:rollup2
VALLEY AREA SO FIRST EXAMPLES

03:17:06.381 --> 03:17:10.886 region:rollup2
CAL VIVA AND THEY OPERATE FRESNO

03:17:08.483 --> 03:17:12.487 region:rollup2
KINGS AND MADERA. SO FIFTY SIX

03:17:10.886 --> 03:17:14.456 region:rollup2

WAS WITHIN THE STANDARD THAT A

03:17:21.263 --> 03:17:26.401 region:rollup2
PASSING SCHOOL WORST IS THAT AN

03:17:23.665 --> 03:17:28.036 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE PERCENTAGE.

03:17:26.401 --> 03:17:29.805 region:rollup2
IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND

03:17:28.036 --> 03:17:31.807 region:rollup2
ONE THAT WE CAN'T ANSWER YET

03:17:29.805 --> 03:17:33.942 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE WE DO NOT

HUNDRED PERCENT. WELL A HUNDRED

03:17:59.701 --> 03:18:02.404 region:rollup2

ITS WAY I RATED COMPLAINTS A

03:18:23.658 --> 03:18:26.661 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT BEING SOMETHING

03:18:25.360 --> 03:18:28.663 region:rollup2

WE. HAVE A DOCUMENT A PROVIDER

03:18:28.663 --> 03:18:32.100 region:rollup2

03:18:32.100 --> 03:18:35.370 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE SHOULD BE BECAUSE NOT

03:18:33.969 --> 03:18:37.906 region:rollup2
ALL PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO HAVE.

HOW THE PHONE CALLS DO NEED TO

PHONE CALLS IS THAT REASONABLE

03:18:48.250 --> 03:18:50.051 region:rollup2
THOSE OF THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS

03:18:49.451 --> 03:18:52.354 region:rollup2

CARE PLANS ARE AT THE MOUTH.

03:20:08.497 --> 03:20:11.833 region:rollup2
BUT THE RULE ITSELF DOES

EIGHTY TWO OH FIVE ITSELF WAS

03:20:21.109 --> 03:20:23.945 region:rollup2
SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR

03:20:22.544 --> 03:20:25.514 region:rollup2

STANDARDS.

03:20:28.083 --> 03:20:31.419 region:rollup2
IT DOES REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO

03:20:29.618 --> 03:20:32.821 region:rollup2
MEET TIME OR DISTANCE AND OR

03:20:31.419 --> 03:20:34.356 region:rollup2

BETTERED ITS ABILITY TO COLLECT

PLANS.

03:20:52.674 --> 03:20:55.176 region:rollup2
ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT

03:20:53.909 --> 03:20:57.279 region:rollup2

THAT IS BEING SIMILAR TO US AND

03:21:14.763 --> 03:21:17.666 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF AN NPI WORK

03:21:16.498 --> 03:21:19.367 region:rollup2

03:21:24.940 --> 03:21:27.742 region:rollup2
THIS DATA SYSTEM PROVIDES DH YES

03:21:29.277 --> 03:21:32.414 region:rollup2
ALLOWING THE H. YES IT ENGAGE IN

MORE TIMELY RESPONSES TO DATA

03:21:32.414 --> 03:21:35.250 region:rollup2
QUALITY ISSUES AND MAKING OF

03:21:34.115 --> 03:21:37.719 region:rollup2
DATA AVAILABLE WHICH PREVIOUSLY

03:21:35.250 --> 03:21:38.853 region:rollup2
WERE NOT.

03:21:37.719 --> 03:21:39.955 region:rollup2
WE NOW KNOW THE NUMBER AND TYPE

03:21:38.853 --> 03:21:41.323 region:rollup2

WORKING WHERE THEY OPERATE.

03:21:42.824 --> 03:21:45.460 region:rollup2
SO EXAMPLES OF THIS INCLUDE

03:21:44.125 --> 03:21:47.295 region:rollup2

03:21:45.460 --> 03:21:49.230 region:rollup2

SEPTEMBER AND AUGUST

03:28:10.478 --> 03:28:13.147 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:28:11.145 --> 03:28:14.749 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE YEAR

03:28:13.147 --> 03:28:16.384 region:rollup2
THERE THEY COULDN'T COMPLY WITH

03:28:14.749 --> 03:28:18.052 region:rollup2
THE STANDARDS BECAUSE AND THERE

03:28:16.384 --> 03:28:20.121 region:rollup2
WERE TOO MANY APPOINTMENTS FOR

03:28:18.052 --> 03:28:21.456 region:rollup2
BACK TO SCHOOL. WHICH

03:28:20.121 --> 03:28:24.292 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S AN

03:28:21.456 --> 03:28:24.826 region:rollup2
ADEQUATEI'M ANSWER FOR PARENTS

03:28:24.292 --> 03:28:26.294 region:rollup2
I AM SO THANK YOU FOR THIS

03:28:24.826 --> 03:28:28.663 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

03:28:26.294 --> 03:28:30.231 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

03:28:28.663 --> 03:28:32.066 region:rollup2
SEE NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON

03:28:30.231 --> 03:28:33.134 region:rollup2
BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS.

03:28:32.066 --> 03:28:35.136 region:rollup2
ALL START WITH A FEW QUESTIONS

03:28:33.134 --> 03:28:36.437 region:rollup2
IF I CAN.

03:28:35.136 --> 03:28:39.140 region:rollup2
FIRST I WANT TO UNDERSTAND FROM

03:28:36.437 --> 03:28:40.274 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE DO WE

03:28:39.140 --> 03:28:44.145 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE

03:28:40.274 --> 03:28:46.247 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT NETWORK ADEQUACY.

03:28:44.145 --> 03:28:48.416 region:rollup2
.

03:28:46.247 --> 03:28:50.284 region:rollup2
SO I'D THIS IS JENNIFER CAN'T.

03:28:48.416 --> 03:28:51.285 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

03:28:50.284 --> 03:28:53.021 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE

03:28:51.285 --> 03:28:55.223 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE OR

03:28:53.021 --> 03:28:56.691 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PROVIDER TYPES THAT WE

03:28:55.223 --> 03:28:58.092 region:rollup2
WILL STIPULATE THAT WE HAVE

03:28:56.691 --> 03:28:59.627 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY.

03:28:58.092 --> 03:29:00.895 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN ZIP CODES

03:28:59.627 --> 03:29:02.263 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE EXEMPTED MANAGED

03:29:00.895 --> 03:29:03.931 region:rollup2
CARE ALTOGETHER AND MEDICAL

03:29:02.263 --> 03:29:04.499 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY. NOT

03:29:03.931 --> 03:29:06.167 region:rollup2
ENOUGH.

03:29:04.499 --> 03:29:07.535 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WITHIN REASONABLE

03:29:06.167 --> 03:29:09.537 region:rollup2
DISTANCE SINCE A MANAGE CARE IS

03:29:07.535 --> 03:29:11.005 region:rollup2
NOT IN THOSE AREAS. I'M I THINK

03:29:09.537 --> 03:29:12.073 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF PLANS AND I

03:29:11.005 --> 03:29:14.742 region:rollup2
THAT WE THAT WE WOULD SAY THIS

03:29:12.073 --> 03:29:16.577 region:rollup2
CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS ARE. I'M

03:29:14.742 --> 03:29:18.112 region:rollup2
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN

03:29:16.577 --> 03:29:19.414 region:rollup2
FACT I WAS IN A MEETING WITH ONE

03:29:18.112 --> 03:29:20.982 region:rollup2
THE OTHER DAY AND I WANTED TO

03:29:19.414 --> 03:29:22.683 region:rollup2
RUN UP TO HIM AND SAY. YOU KNOW

03:29:20.982 --> 03:29:24.152 region:rollup2
CURRY CONTRACTING WITH AND HOW

03:29:22.683 --> 03:29:25.186 region:rollup2
CAN WE GET YOU TO CONTRACT THERE

03:29:24.152 --> 03:29:27.455 region:rollup2
ARE CERTAIN.

03:29:25.186 --> 03:29:28.689 region:rollup2
SPECIALTIES THAT ARE JUST

03:29:27.455 --> 03:29:30.191 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT DEPENDING ON

03:29:28.689 --> 03:29:31.692 region:rollup2
THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT YOU'RE

03:29:30.191 --> 03:29:33.461 region:rollup2
IN IN THE STATE BECAUSE.

03:29:31.692 --> 03:29:35.696 region:rollup2
THEY REQUIRE A CERTAIN AMOUNT

03:29:33.461 --> 03:29:36.931 region:rollup2
OF VOLUME IN ORDER TO SURVIVE

03:29:35.696 --> 03:29:39.200 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN RURAL

03:29:36.931 --> 03:29:40.768 region:rollup2
AREA IF YOU'RE NEUROLOGISTS.

03:29:39.200 --> 03:29:42.036 region:rollup2
AND YOUR YOU KNOW I COME FROM

03:29:40.768 --> 03:29:43.604 region:rollup2
MARIPOSA COUNTY SO.

03:29:42.036 --> 03:29:44.739 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN

03:29:43.604 --> 03:29:46.274 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SIXTY THREE PEOPLE IN

03:29:44.739 --> 03:29:47.475 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE COUNTY THERE'S NOT A

03:29:46.274 --> 03:29:50.244 region:rollup2
NEUROLOGISTS THAT'S GOING TO BE

03:29:47.475 --> 03:29:51.712 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SURVIVE IN THAT COUNTY

03:29:50.244 --> 03:29:53.414 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LOW.

03:29:51.712 --> 03:29:55.349 region:rollup2
POPULATION ALTOGETHER AND SO I

03:29:53.414 --> 03:29:58.119 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT WE BELIEVE THAT

03:29:55.349 --> 03:29:59.353 region:rollup2
WE HAVE COME A GREAT DEAL IN

03:29:58.119 --> 03:30:01.789 region:rollup2
TERMS OF OUR TOOLS.

03:29:59.353 --> 03:30:03.858 region:rollup2
AND OUR DATA IN ORDER TO

03:30:01.789 --> 03:30:05.426 region:rollup2
MONITOR NETWORK ADEQUACY BUT I

03:30:03.858 --> 03:30:06.494 region:rollup2
WOULD NEVER SAY THAT YOU KNOW

03:30:05.426 --> 03:30:08.262 region:rollup2
THERE IS A HUNDRED PERCENT

03:30:06.494 --> 03:30:10.031 region:rollup2
COVERAGE FOR A HUNDRED YOU KNOW

03:30:08.262 --> 03:30:11.232 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE TIME MEETING ALL

03:30:10.031 --> 03:30:12.366 region:rollup2
OF THE DIFFERENT REGULATORY

03:30:11.232 --> 03:30:13.901 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS BUT I BELIEVE THAT

03:30:12.366 --> 03:30:15.837 region:rollup2
WE ARE SO MUCH FARTHER ALONG

03:30:13.901 --> 03:30:17.205 region:rollup2
THAN WE. USED TO BE AND THAT YOU

03:30:15.837 --> 03:30:19.841 region:rollup2
KNOW SERIOUS VERY.

03:30:17.205 --> 03:30:21.375 region:rollup2
KIND OF TOPICAL IN TERMS OF

03:30:19.841 --> 03:30:23.044 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE SOPHISTICATION

03:30:21.375 --> 03:30:24.812 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE REALLY GROWN UP AS

03:30:23.044 --> 03:30:26.280 region:rollup2
A STATE AND AS A DEPARTMENT. BUT

03:30:24.812 --> 03:30:28.416 region:rollup2
WE HAVE REALLY MATURED OUR

03:30:26.280 --> 03:30:29.750 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND SO I'M.

03:30:28.416 --> 03:30:31.085 region:rollup2
.

03:30:29.750 --> 03:30:32.520 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT

03:30:31.085 --> 03:30:34.155 region:rollup2
TRACK BUT I KNOW THAT THERE WILL

03:30:32.520 --> 03:30:35.923 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BE CERTAIN AREAS OR

03:30:34.155 --> 03:30:37.592 region:rollup2
SPECIALTIES THAT WE WILL ALWAYS

03:30:35.923 --> 03:30:39.694 region:rollup2
AND STRUGGLE WITH NOT JUST FOR

03:30:37.592 --> 03:30:41.796 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL BUT FOR BOTH. MEDI CAL

03:30:39.694 --> 03:30:42.663 region:rollup2
AND COMMERCIAL AND OTHER TYPES

03:30:41.796 --> 03:30:43.831 region:rollup2
OF OF POPULATIONS

03:30:42.663 --> 03:30:45.633 region:rollup2
WHAT I.

03:30:43.831 --> 03:30:47.802 region:rollup2
ON.

03:30:45.633 --> 03:30:50.271 region:rollup2
HOPE YOU HEAR FROM US IS IT

03:30:47.802 --> 03:30:52.240 region:rollup2
SEEMS AS IF THIS IS AN ONGOING.

03:30:50.271 --> 03:30:54.575 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND EVEN IF WE HAVE MADE

03:30:52.240 --> 03:30:55.409 region:rollup2
GREAT STRIDES.

03:30:54.575 --> 03:30:57.245 region:rollup2
WE BEAR THE FIDUCIARY

03:30:55.409 --> 03:30:59.380 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY.

03:30:57.245 --> 03:31:00.982 region:rollup2
TO ARE TAXPAYERS TO MAKE SURE

03:30:59.380 --> 03:31:03.217 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. THE

03:31:00.982 --> 03:31:05.653 region:rollup2
SERVICES AS DESIGNATED BY THE

03:31:03.217 --> 03:31:06.988 region:rollup2
KNOX KEEN ACT AND SO. I'M TRYING

03:31:05.653 --> 03:31:09.023 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND WHO IS IT

03:31:06.988 --> 03:31:12.293 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THAT DETERMINES

03:31:09.023 --> 03:31:14.262 region:rollup2
NETWORK ADEQUACY AND AUTHORIZES.

03:31:12.293 --> 03:31:14.862 region:rollup2
SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR

03:31:14.262 --> 03:31:17.431 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

03:31:14.862 --> 03:31:18.432 region:rollup2
WE AND CERTAINLY AND MARY

03:31:17.431 --> 03:31:20.201 region:rollup2
CAMPBELL WHO'S THE STATE

03:31:18.432 --> 03:31:22.169 region:rollup2
MEDICAID DIRECTOR SHE HAS TO

03:31:20.201 --> 03:31:24.772 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY CERTIFY EVERY SINGLE

03:31:22.169 --> 03:31:27.008 region:rollup2
PLANNED NETWORK BY JULY FIRST

03:31:24.772 --> 03:31:28.075 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN SARAH SPEAKING ONLY TO

03:31:27.008 --> 03:31:29.644 region:rollup2
MEDICAL MANAGED CARE WHICH IS

03:31:28.075 --> 03:31:31.312 region:rollup2
WITHIN HER PURVIEW. THESE ARE

03:31:29.644 --> 03:31:32.180 region:rollup2
ALSO NETWORK CERTIFICATIONS

03:31:31.312 --> 03:31:33.514 region:rollup2
REQUIRED OF OUR COUNTY MENTAL

03:31:32.180 --> 03:31:34.549 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS THERE'S FIFTY SIX

03:31:33.514 --> 03:31:36.250 region:rollup2
OF THEM.

03:31:34.549 --> 03:31:38.452 region:rollup2
TEN COUNTIES SUBSTANCE USE

03:31:36.250 --> 03:31:40.788 region:rollup2

DELL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN BOTH

03:31:40.788 --> 03:31:45.726 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES

03:31:42.123 --> 03:31:47.361 region:rollup2
COUNTY SO PROBABLY WELL OVER.

03:31:45.726 --> 03:31:49.397 region:rollup2
OF HUNDRED AND.

03:31:47.361 --> 03:31:51.599 region:rollup2
TWENTY NETWORK CERTIFICATIONS

03:31:49.397 --> 03:31:52.934 region:rollup2
THAT SHE WILL HAVE TO SIGN OFF

03:31:51.599 --> 03:31:54.969 region:rollup2
ON AND CERTIFY TO THE FEDERAL

03:31:52.934 --> 03:31:56.637 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT. AND SHE WILL NOT DO

03:31:54.969 --> 03:31:58.406 region:rollup2
THAT UNTIL WE HAVE.

03:31:56.637 --> 03:32:00.374 region:rollup2
MADE SURE THAT THE DATA PROVIDED

03:31:58.406 --> 03:32:02.076 region:rollup2
BY THE PLANS HAS BEEN BOTH

03:32:00.374 --> 03:32:04.612 region:rollup2
VALIDATED AND THAT WE FEEL IT'S

03:32:02.076 --> 03:32:06.180 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE FOR THE POPULATION. IN

03:32:04.612 --> 03:32:07.782 region:rollup2
THAT COUNTY OR IN THAT SERVICE

03:32:06.180 --> 03:32:09.250 region:rollup2
AREA. UNDER THE CERTAIN

03:32:07.782 --> 03:32:10.151 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE OUTLINED

03:32:09.250 --> 03:32:12.553 region:rollup2
IN THE BILL.

03:32:10.151 --> 03:32:13.988 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT PLANTS DO

03:32:12.553 --> 03:32:16.691 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK

03:32:13.988 --> 03:32:18.359 region:rollup2
MEANING THEY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF.

03:32:16.691 --> 03:32:19.694 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN TYPE OF SPECIALIST OR

03:32:18.359 --> 03:32:20.595 region:rollup2
ON THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SIDE

03:32:19.694 --> 03:32:22.163 region:rollup2
IF THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

03:32:20.595 --> 03:32:23.764 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRISTS.

03:32:22.163 --> 03:32:25.466 region:rollup2
TO HANDLE THE POPULATIONTHAT

03:32:23.764 --> 03:32:28.102 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT THEY NEED.

03:32:25.466 --> 03:32:29.403 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT OUR

03:32:28.102 --> 03:32:31.305 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION TO THE FEDERAL

03:32:29.403 --> 03:32:33.374 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WILL INVOLVE THEM

03:32:31.305 --> 03:32:34.809 region:rollup2
PAIN OUT OF NETWORK FOR

03:32:33.374 --> 03:32:35.710 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS

03:32:34.809 --> 03:32:36.978 region:rollup2
THEY CAN HAVE A CONTRACT GOOD

03:32:35.710 --> 03:32:38.879 region:rollup2
NETWORK IN PLACE THAT MEETS

03:32:36.978 --> 03:32:40.314 region:rollup2
NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS. SO I

03:32:38.879 --> 03:32:41.949 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE ARE TRYING BOTH TO

03:32:40.314 --> 03:32:43.918 region:rollup2
IMPART.

03:32:41.949 --> 03:32:45.920 region:rollup2
THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE.

03:32:43.918 --> 03:32:47.521 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND THE CERTIFICATION

03:32:45.920 --> 03:32:49.090 region:rollup2
ON OUR BEHALF AND I'M NOT

03:32:47.521 --> 03:32:50.825 region:rollup2
SPEAKING TO THE D. IMAGE SEE

03:32:49.090 --> 03:32:51.692 region:rollup2
ISSUES AROUND WHAT THEY DO TO

03:32:50.825 --> 03:32:53.060 region:rollup2
VALIDATE NETWORK ADEQUACY BUT I

03:32:51.692 --> 03:32:55.263 region:rollup2
THINK. THE PLANS.

03:32:53.060 --> 03:32:56.597 region:rollup2
KNOW OUR INTENT OF HOW WE

03:32:55.263 --> 03:32:58.566 region:rollup2
INTEND TO CERTIFY BECAUSE WE

03:32:56.597 --> 03:33:00.968 region:rollup2
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND THEN AGAIN

03:32:58.566 --> 03:33:01.969 region:rollup2
IT'S A MATURITY OF BOTH DATA AND

03:33:00.968 --> 03:33:03.504 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

03:33:01.969 --> 03:33:05.773 region:rollup2
I MEAN WE HOPE THAT.

03:33:03.504 --> 03:33:06.674 region:rollup2
THERE'S OTHER PARTS OF THE

03:33:05.773 --> 03:33:08.175 region:rollup2
WORLD'S THAT.

03:33:06.674 --> 03:33:11.312 region:rollup2
OUR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T TOUCH

03:33:08.175 --> 03:33:12.580 region:rollup2
RAY I CAN'T GROW PHYSICIANS ON

03:33:11.312 --> 03:33:14.548 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO GROW

03:33:12.580 --> 03:33:16.083 region:rollup2
SOME CHILD PSYCHIATRIST ON THOSE

03:33:14.548 --> 03:33:17.618 region:rollup2
ARE ISSUES BIGGER AND BROADER

03:33:16.083 --> 03:33:18.853 region:rollup2
BINDER BEYOND OUR DEPARTMENT BUT

03:33:17.618 --> 03:33:20.454 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT WE WORK WITH THE

03:33:18.853 --> 03:33:22.556 region:rollup2
PLAN'S PRETTY CLOSELY TO BOTH

03:33:20.454 --> 03:33:24.925 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THOSE. AND THEY ARE

03:33:22.556 --> 03:33:26.293 region:rollup2
PUSH TO PAY AT CERTAIN POINTS

03:33:24.925 --> 03:33:27.561 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET A

03:33:26.293 --> 03:33:28.696 region:rollup2
PATIENT TO THE PLACE THAT THEY

03:33:27.561 --> 03:33:29.697 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE IF THEY DON'T HAVE

03:33:28.696 --> 03:33:31.332 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WITHIN THEIR

03:33:29.697 --> 03:33:32.633 region:rollup2
CONTRACTING NETWORK.

03:33:31.332 --> 03:33:34.535 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEDICAL

03:33:32.633 --> 03:33:36.303 region:rollup2
PATIENTS BEING IMPROPERLY DENIED

03:33:34.535 --> 03:33:37.838 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE IN ORDER TO

03:33:36.303 --> 03:33:39.774 region:rollup2
REDUCE COSTS.

03:33:37.838 --> 03:33:42.243 region:rollup2
FOR MORE EXPLICITLY IF I CAN

03:33:39.774 --> 03:33:43.878 region:rollup2
SYSTEMATICALLY BLOCKING PATIENTS

03:33:42.243 --> 03:33:45.346 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDERS FROM ACCESSING IN

03:33:43.878 --> 03:33:46.280 region:rollup2
NETWORK.

03:33:45.346 --> 03:33:49.283 region:rollup2
SPECIALISTS WHO ARE DEEMED TOO

03:33:46.280 --> 03:33:51.052 region:rollup2
COSTLY.

03:33:49.283 --> 03:33:53.054 region:rollup2
SO I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO.

03:33:51.052 --> 03:33:53.921 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE THAT HAPPENED IN THE

03:33:53.054 --> 03:33:56.090 region:rollup2
FALL.

03:33:53.921 --> 03:33:57.591 region:rollup2
IN WHICH

03:33:56.090 --> 03:33:59.927 region:rollup2
ARE THERE WERE WHISTLEBLOWER

03:33:57.591 --> 03:34:02.763 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS OF IMPROPER ON

03:33:59.927 --> 03:34:04.632 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES BY A NON.

03:34:02.763 --> 03:34:06.334 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T A MEDICAL GROUP IT

03:34:04.632 --> 03:34:09.170 region:rollup2
WASN'T HEALTH PLAN IT WAS A.

03:34:06.334 --> 03:34:10.571 region:rollup2
ENTITY OUTSIDE OF THAT AND SO

03:34:09.170 --> 03:34:12.440 region:rollup2
WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

03:34:10.571 --> 03:34:14.041 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE

03:34:12.440 --> 03:34:16.544 region:rollup2
AND THE PLANS TO BOTH.

03:34:14.041 --> 03:34:18.846 region:rollup2
QUICKLY ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR

03:34:16.544 --> 03:34:19.380 region:rollup2
SITUATION AS WELL AS PUT ALL OF

03:34:18.846 --> 03:34:21.282 region:rollup2
OUR PLANS ON A CORRECTIVE

03:34:19.380 --> 03:34:22.750 region:rollup2
ACTION.

03:34:21.282 --> 03:34:25.186 region:rollup2
I PLAN THAT SARAH AND HER TEAM

03:34:22.750 --> 03:34:25.386 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN LEADING TO MAKE SURE

03:34:25.186 --> 03:34:27.855 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:34:25.386 --> 03:34:30.725 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WERE NOT IMPROPERLY

03:34:27.855 --> 03:34:30.925 region:rollup2
EITHER DENIED OR THAT REFERRAL

03:34:30.725 --> 03:34:31.559 region:rollup2
FORM.

03:34:30.925 --> 03:34:32.927 region:rollup2
.

03:34:31.559 --> 03:34:34.362 region:rollup2
REFERRALS NEEDED TO BE MADE TO

03:34:32.927 --> 03:34:36.497 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT PROVIDER FOR THE RIGHT

03:34:34.362 --> 03:34:38.432 region:rollup2
ITEM BUT PLANS WENT BACK.

03:34:36.497 --> 03:34:39.900 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TWO YEARS TO MAKE

03:34:38.432 --> 03:34:41.569 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THEY REACHED OUT TO

03:34:39.900 --> 03:34:42.737 region:rollup2
PATIENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAD

03:34:41.569 --> 03:34:43.871 region:rollup2
THERE BEEN A REFERRAL OR HAD

03:34:42.737 --> 03:34:45.172 region:rollup2
THERE BEEN AN AUTHORIZATION FOR

03:34:43.871 --> 03:34:47.341 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT WERE NOT PROVIDED

03:34:45.172 --> 03:34:48.976 region:rollup2
THAT WE MADE. UP FOR THAT AND SO

03:34:47.341 --> 03:34:51.812 region:rollup2
I WOULD AND SAY THAT THAT

03:34:48.976 --> 03:34:52.947 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR INSTANCE AN EXAMPLE

03:34:51.812 --> 03:34:54.982 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AND WE'RE

03:34:52.947 --> 03:34:56.217 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY STILL I'M WORKING WITH

03:34:54.982 --> 03:34:57.218 region:rollup2
THE PLANTS UNDER THEIR

03:34:56.217 --> 03:34:58.586 region:rollup2
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS FOR THE.

03:34:57.218 --> 03:35:00.554 region:rollup2
DOES IT SHOW THOUGH IT LACKED

03:34:58.586 --> 03:35:02.890 region:rollup2
GOAL LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF

03:35:00.554 --> 03:35:04.425 region:rollup2
AMONG THE COMPANIES INVOLVED IN

03:35:02.890 --> 03:35:06.026 region:rollup2
MEDICAID MANAGED CARE.

03:35:04.425 --> 03:35:07.895 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NOT TO USE A EUPHEMISM

03:35:06.026 --> 03:35:09.230 region:rollup2
BUT AS THE FOX GUARDING THE HEN

03:35:07.895 --> 03:35:10.765 region:rollup2
HOUSE.

03:35:09.230 --> 03:35:11.065 region:rollup2
WELL I WOULD SAY FOR THAT

03:35:10.765 --> 03:35:15.169 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

03:35:11.065 --> 03:35:19.073 region:rollup2
CASE THOUGH THE WAY THAT IT WAS.

03:35:15.169 --> 03:35:21.909 region:rollup2
FOUND WAS A PLAN WAS IN DOING

03:35:19.073 --> 03:35:24.545 region:rollup2
AN AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE CHECK.

03:35:21.909 --> 03:35:25.546 region:rollup2
AND THERE WAS A STAFF MEMBER.

03:35:24.545 --> 03:35:27.381 region:rollup2
THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE

03:35:25.546 --> 03:35:29.250 region:rollup2
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT THAT

03:35:27.381 --> 03:35:31.185 region:rollup2
ACCIDENTALLY GAVE THEM DATA THAT

03:35:29.250 --> 03:35:32.753 region:rollup2
THEY SAID THIS DOESN'T. LOOK

03:35:31.185 --> 03:35:35.189 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THEN THE WHOLE AYE

03:35:32.753 --> 03:35:37.958 region:rollup2
THING. KIND OF OPENED UP.

03:35:35.189 --> 03:35:40.394 region:rollup2
WHEN ALL OF OUR PLANS WENT IN

03:35:37.958 --> 03:35:41.495 region:rollup2
TO DO THEIR OWN CHECK

03:35:40.394 --> 03:35:43.664 region:rollup2
SEE.

03:35:41.495 --> 03:35:45.433 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND

03:35:43.664 --> 03:35:46.400 region:rollup2
THEN AND TO VALIDATE THE NATURE

03:35:45.433 --> 03:35:48.769 region:rollup2
OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT?

03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:50.971 region:rollup2
?

03:35:48.769 --> 03:35:52.373 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS EMPLOYED IN THAT

03:35:50.971 --> 03:35:54.008 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION ADMITTED TO

03:35:52.373 --> 03:35:56.010 region:rollup2
FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS

03:35:54.008 --> 03:35:58.646 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY.

03:35:56.010 --> 03:36:00.748 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT OF A UNFAIR

03:35:58.646 --> 03:36:02.483 region:rollup2
STATEMENT TO SAY THAT THE PLANS

03:36:00.748 --> 03:36:04.185 region:rollup2
WERE NOT CONDUCTING OVERSIGHT

03:36:02.483 --> 03:36:05.352 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY WERE BUT THAT

03:36:04.185 --> 03:36:07.555 region:rollup2
YOU HAD AN ENTITY THAT WAS

03:36:05.352 --> 03:36:08.155 region:rollup2
DELIBERATELY AND THEY HAVE NOW

03:36:07.555 --> 03:36:09.790 region:rollup2
CSUS.

03:36:08.155 --> 03:36:11.792 region:rollup2
ADMITTED AS MUCH THAT THEY WERE

03:36:09.790 --> 03:36:13.661 region:rollup2
FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS AT THE

03:36:11.792 --> 03:36:15.930 region:rollup2
PLANS WERE VALIDATING AND SO I

03:36:13.661 --> 03:36:17.665 region:rollup2
THINK IT OPENED FOR US OBVIOUSLY

03:36:15.930 --> 03:36:19.133 region:rollup2
WE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY I

03:36:17.665 --> 03:36:20.868 region:rollup2
THINK FOR THE PLANS THEY TOOK IT

03:36:19.133 --> 03:36:22.736 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUSLY AND. WERE STILL

03:36:20.868 --> 03:36:24.238 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN.

03:36:22.736 --> 03:36:25.072 region:rollup2
SOME INTERNAL THINKING ABOUT.

03:36:24.238 --> 03:36:27.575 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN WE DO?

03:36:25.072 --> 03:36:29.143 region:rollup2
AS A STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:36:27.575 --> 03:36:31.212 region:rollup2
ARE ON PUTTING INTO THIS.

03:36:29.143 --> 03:36:32.713 region:rollup2
PLACE OTHER WAYS TO DOUBLE

03:36:31.212 --> 03:36:34.648 region:rollup2
CHECK INFORMATION I THINK THE

03:36:32.713 --> 03:36:36.183 region:rollup2
PLANS CERTAINLY WANT TO DO THAT

03:36:34.648 --> 03:36:37.785 region:rollup2
AS WELL BUT.

03:36:36.183 --> 03:36:39.220 region:rollup2
THE FALSE THE DIRECT

03:36:37.785 --> 03:36:41.255 region:rollup2
FALSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS

03:36:39.220 --> 03:36:42.089 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IS I'M CERTAINLY WE

03:36:41.255 --> 03:36:43.858 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HAD

03:36:42.089 --> 03:36:46.293 region:rollup2
WHISTLEBLOWERS NOT NOT MADE THAT

03:36:43.858 --> 03:36:47.928 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO US. AND I'M GONNA.

03:36:46.293 --> 03:36:49.296 region:rollup2
ALLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO TO

03:36:47.928 --> 03:36:50.898 region:rollup2
JUMP IN HERE BUT IT DOES SEEM

03:36:49.296 --> 03:36:52.399 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS SUBSIDIARITY AT ITS

03:36:50.898 --> 03:36:54.735 region:rollup2
WORST.

03:36:52.399 --> 03:36:57.605 region:rollup2
THAT BY PUSHING THIS

03:36:54.735 --> 03:36:59.173 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY FURTHER DOWN IT'S

03:36:57.605 --> 03:36:59.740 region:rollup2
REMOVING THE STATE FROM OUR

03:36:59.173 --> 03:37:01.909 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT WE

03:36:59.740 --> 03:37:04.378 region:rollup2
ARE.

03:37:01.909 --> 03:37:06.447 region:rollup2
MEETING OUR KNOCKS KEEN ACT.

03:37:04.378 --> 03:37:07.948 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS. QUITE A SECOND

03:37:06.447 --> 03:37:09.183 region:rollup2
QUESTION DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

03:37:07.948 --> 03:37:10.784 region:rollup2
HOW MANY PATIENTS WERE AFFECTED

03:37:09.183 --> 03:37:13.621 region:rollup2
MOM BY THAT.

03:37:10.784 --> 03:37:15.623 region:rollup2
I'M I DON'T THINK THAT WE KNOW

03:37:13.621 --> 03:37:17.925 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY WERE IMPACTED OR WE

03:37:15.623 --> 03:37:20.594 region:rollup2
KNOW THE GENERAL POPULATION FOR

03:37:17.925 --> 03:37:22.796 region:rollup2
WHICH THIS ENTITY WAS MANAGING.

03:37:20.594 --> 03:37:23.664 region:rollup2
APPEALS GRIEVANCES REFERRALS

03:37:22.796 --> 03:37:25.900 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE BACK AND

03:37:23.664 --> 03:37:28.068 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS BUT

03:37:25.900 --> 03:37:29.069 region:rollup2
WHEN THE PLANS WENT AND EACH OF

03:37:28.068 --> 03:37:31.205 region:rollup2
THE PLANS.

03:37:29.069 --> 03:37:32.740 region:rollup2
TRIED TO FIND MEMBERS THAT HAD

03:37:31.205 --> 03:37:34.008 region:rollup2
BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR OF

03:37:32.740 --> 03:37:36.210 region:rollup2
MAYBE HADN'T HAD THE RIGHT

03:37:34.008 --> 03:37:37.211 region:rollup2
REFERRAL. THOSE ARE MUCH HARDER

03:37:36.210 --> 03:37:38.746 region:rollup2
NUMBERS TO.

03:37:37.211 --> 03:37:40.080 region:rollup2
.

03:37:38.746 --> 03:37:40.681 region:rollup2
TO KNOW JUST BECAUSE SOME

03:37:40.080 --> 03:37:46.620 region:rollup2
PATIENTS YOU COULDN'T FIND AND

03:37:40.681 --> 03:37:48.022 region:rollup2
IF POPULATION THAT WAS

03:37:46.620 --> 03:37:51.025 region:rollup2
BEING MANAGED BY THAT ENTITY WAS

03:37:48.022 --> 03:37:52.593 region:rollup2
SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND.

03:37:51.025 --> 03:37:54.028 region:rollup2
LIVES BUT THEY WERE.

03:37:52.593 --> 03:37:54.995 region:rollup2
THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY ALL

03:37:54.028 --> 03:37:56.697 region:rollup2
IMPACTED.

03:37:54.995 --> 03:37:58.465 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT

03:37:56.697 --> 03:38:01.035 region:rollup2
WE DON'T NECESSARILY.

03:37:58.465 --> 03:38:02.202 region:rollup2
HAVE ANYWAY TO VALIDATE BUT

03:38:01.035 --> 03:38:03.203 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE SENT SENT THE

03:38:02.202 --> 03:38:04.471 region:rollup2
PLANS BACKED

03:38:03.203 --> 03:38:05.639 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS TO REACH OUT TO THE

03:38:04.471 --> 03:38:07.708 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES THAT THEY HAD

03:38:05.639 --> 03:38:09.176 region:rollup2
UNDER THEIR CARE. TO MAKE SURE

03:38:07.708 --> 03:38:12.279 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE.

03:38:09.176 --> 03:38:13.447 region:rollup2
BOTH CONTACTED IF THEY.

03:38:12.279 --> 03:38:14.848 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO BE CONTACTED AND

03:38:13.447 --> 03:38:16.417 region:rollup2
THEN IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT

03:38:14.848 --> 03:38:17.484 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED TO AUTHORIZE

03:38:16.417 --> 03:38:19.553 region:rollup2
IT. SO.

03:38:17.484 --> 03:38:20.154 region:rollup2
I GUESS IF EVEN IF IT WAS TEN

03:38:19.553 --> 03:38:21.455 region:rollup2
PERCENT WERE LOOKING AT SIXTY

03:38:20.154 --> 03:38:23.924 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

03:38:21.455 --> 03:38:24.525 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AFFECTED. PLANE WHEN YOU

03:38:23.924 --> 03:38:25.392 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS LIKE

03:38:24.525 --> 03:38:27.995 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:38:25.392 --> 03:38:30.564 region:rollup2
IT'S.

03:38:27.995 --> 03:38:32.132 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND FOR

03:38:30.564 --> 03:38:33.567 region:rollup2
ME I AND I'M SURE THAT MY

03:38:32.132 --> 03:38:34.735 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES FEEL THE SAME WAY BUT

03:38:33.567 --> 03:38:35.603 region:rollup2
EVEN TEN PERCENT OF SIXTY

03:38:34.735 --> 03:38:37.237 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WERE

03:38:35.603 --> 03:38:39.273 region:rollup2
AFFECTED AND SO. SO.

03:38:37.237 --> 03:38:41.442 region:rollup2
E..

03:38:39.273 --> 03:38:44.244 region:rollup2
WE ARE DISCUSSING YOU KNOW WHAT

03:38:41.442 --> 03:38:45.646 region:rollup2
YOU ARE TRYING TO DO. THAT YOU

03:38:44.244 --> 03:38:47.147 region:rollup2
JUST SAID THAT YOU'RE IN.

03:38:45.646 --> 03:38:49.650 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO

03:38:47.147 --> 03:38:51.118 region:rollup2
PREVENT IT BUT.

03:38:49.650 --> 03:38:53.053 region:rollup2
IT GOES BACK TO ON THE

03:38:51.118 --> 03:38:55.389 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:38:53.053 --> 03:38:55.990 region:rollup2
OFFICE SO WE CLEARLY DIDN'T HAVE

03:38:55.389 --> 03:38:59.093 region:rollup2
ENOUGH ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM.

03:38:55.990 --> 03:39:00.794 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S.

03:38:59.093 --> 03:39:01.962 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME OR

03:39:00.794 --> 03:39:04.732 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE THEN THAN.

03:39:01.962 --> 03:39:06.266 region:rollup2
ONES THAT. ARE ACCOUNTABILITY

03:39:04.732 --> 03:39:08.469 region:rollup2
IS NOT WORKING AND SOUL.

03:39:06.266 --> 03:39:10.771 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M THINKING IS HOW MANY

03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:11.238 region:rollup2
OTHER? ISSUES ARE WE GONNA FIND

03:39:10.771 --> 03:39:13.640 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS LACK OF

03:39:11.238 --> 03:39:14.308 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY. SO I THINK FOR

03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:16.276 region:rollup2
ME THE OVERALL.

03:39:14.308 --> 03:39:18.245 region:rollup2
.

03:39:16.276 --> 03:39:19.780 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION SHOULD BE ABOUT NOT

03:39:18.245 --> 03:39:22.049 region:rollup2
JUST ONE DEPARTMENT OR ONE

03:39:19.780 --> 03:39:24.218 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AREA BECAUSE IF I'M

03:39:22.049 --> 03:39:24.885 region:rollup2
THINKING THAT THERE'S MORE.

03:39:24.218 --> 03:39:26.420 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT THERE IS NO

03:39:24.885 --> 03:39:27.721 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK THE

03:39:26.420 --> 03:39:29.189 region:rollup2
BIGGER QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE

03:39:27.721 --> 03:39:29.890 region:rollup2
DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:39:29.189 --> 03:39:31.358 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IS ACCOUNTED FOR

03:39:29.890 --> 03:39:34.561 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IS ACCOUNTABLE AND I.

03:39:31.358 --> 03:39:36.530 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S. THE QUESTION THAT

03:39:34.561 --> 03:39:38.098 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I WOULD FRANKLY LIKE AT

03:39:36.530 --> 03:39:40.601 region:rollup2
LEAST SOME CONVERSATION ON. AND

03:39:38.098 --> 03:39:42.436 region:rollup2
ALONG THOSE LINES THE STATE HAS

03:39:40.601 --> 03:39:44.038 region:rollup2
ORDERED INSURERS ON NOVEMBER

03:39:42.436 --> 03:39:45.339 region:rollup2
SEVENTEENTH TO DETERMINE HOW

03:39:44.038 --> 03:39:47.908 region:rollup2
MANY ENROLLEES EXPERIENCED THE

03:39:45.339 --> 03:39:49.343 region:rollup2
LATER UNFILLED SERVICES. DO WE

03:39:47.908 --> 03:39:51.678 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY RESULTS FROM THAT

03:39:49.343 --> 03:39:54.114 region:rollup2
QUARTER SO WE DO COLLECT WEEKLY

03:39:51.678 --> 03:39:55.983 region:rollup2
REPORTS FROM OUR HEALTH PLANS

03:39:54.114 --> 03:39:57.551 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE BEEN ONGOING IT'S

03:39:55.983 --> 03:39:58.185 region:rollup2
ADMITTING THEM TO US THE. HEALTH

03:39:57.551 --> 03:39:59.186 region:rollup2
PLANS THEMSELVES ARE STILL IN

03:39:58.185 --> 03:40:00.320 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF REACHING OUT TO

03:39:59.186 --> 03:40:01.522 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES CONTACTING THEM

03:40:00.320 --> 03:40:03.991 region:rollup2
AND SO WE DON'T HAVE FINAL

03:40:01.522 --> 03:40:04.591 region:rollup2
NUMBERS AT THIS TIME BUT I

03:40:03.991 --> 03:40:05.025 region:rollup2
EXPECT WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATE IN

03:40:04.591 --> 03:40:07.327 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

03:40:05.025 --> 03:40:08.996 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN THE MHC DO TO IMPROVE

03:40:07.327 --> 03:40:11.265 region:rollup2
THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF

03:40:08.996 --> 03:40:13.300 region:rollup2
THEIR TIMELY ACCESS COMPLIANCE

03:40:11.265 --> 03:40:14.535 region:rollup2
DATA AND HOW DO WE DISAGGREGATED

03:40:13.300 --> 03:40:17.371 region:rollup2
THIS DATA TO ENSURE THAT SUB

03:40:14.535 --> 03:40:19.039 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY CARE? IS BEING MET.

03:40:17.371 --> 03:40:20.474 region:rollup2
SO ANOTHER THE STEPS THAT I

03:40:19.039 --> 03:40:21.909 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED EARLIER ABOUT.

03:40:20.474 --> 03:40:22.509 region:rollup2
REQUIRING THE INDEPENDENT IT A

03:40:21.909 --> 03:40:24.845 region:rollup2
VALIDATOR.

03:40:22.509 --> 03:40:25.679 region:rollup2
TO VALIDATE THE DATA BEFORE IT

03:40:24.845 --> 03:40:27.748 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED TO THE DAMAGE SEE.

03:40:25.679 --> 03:40:30.150 region:rollup2
HAS ALREADY APPROVED THE.

03:40:27.748 --> 03:40:30.651 region:rollup2
DATA QUALITY THAT WILL ALLOW US

03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:31.485 region:rollup2
TO DISAGGREGATED AS YOU

03:40:30.651 --> 03:40:33.353 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

03:40:31.485 --> 03:40:34.555 region:rollup2
WE EXPECTED THE INFORMATION

03:40:33.353 --> 03:40:36.190 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA COME IN ON MARCH

03:40:34.555 --> 03:40:36.657 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR WHICH

03:40:36.190 --> 03:40:38.158 region:rollup2
WILL BE FOR THE TWENTY

03:40:36.657 --> 03:40:39.760 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

03:40:38.158 --> 03:40:40.961 region:rollup2
ARE REPORTING YEAR WILL BE MUCH

03:40:39.760 --> 03:40:42.763 region:rollup2
BETTER BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE

03:40:40.961 --> 03:40:44.131 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED THOSE SURVEYS AFTER WE

03:40:42.763 --> 03:40:45.332 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED THE ERRORS IN THE

03:40:44.131 --> 03:40:46.667 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN CLICK HERE. AND

03:40:45.332 --> 03:40:47.968 region:rollup2
SO WERE WERE VERY MUCH LOOKING

03:40:46.667 --> 03:40:49.803 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO THAT REPORT AND

03:40:47.968 --> 03:40:51.305 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE

03:40:49.803 --> 03:40:53.540 region:rollup2
ABLE TO REPORT ON GRANT. OF MUCH

03:40:51.305 --> 03:40:55.008 region:rollup2
MORE GRANULARITY INCLUDING MORE

03:40:53.540 --> 03:40:56.577 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL AND I DON'T KNOW IF

03:40:55.008 --> 03:40:58.412 region:rollup2
I'LL BE ABLE TO DO EVERY COUNTY

03:40:56.577 --> 03:41:00.047 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. AT THE AN AMAZING

03:40:58.412 --> 03:41:01.215 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT JENNIFER GAVE AND I

03:41:00.047 --> 03:41:03.517 region:rollup2
MARIPOSA COUNTY SOMETIMES YOU

03:41:01.215 --> 03:41:06.587 region:rollup2
CAN'T GET TO ANYTHING CLOSE TO A

03:41:03.517 --> 03:41:06.720 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT.

03:41:06.587 --> 03:41:07.688 region:rollup2
.

03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:10.591 region:rollup2
STANDARD AND SO.

03:41:07.688 --> 03:41:12.159 region:rollup2
I EXPECTED ARE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

03:41:10.591 --> 03:41:13.160 region:rollup2
REPORTING YEAR WILL GET MUCH

03:41:12.159 --> 03:41:14.595 region:rollup2
CLOSER TO WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING

03:41:13.160 --> 03:41:17.264 region:rollup2
A WHAT FRANKLY WE'RE EXPECTING

03:41:14.595 --> 03:41:18.265 region:rollup2
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE CONTRACT

03:41:17.264 --> 03:41:18.832 region:rollup2
VERSES THE FULL TIME.

03:41:18.265 --> 03:41:30.043 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT TO ENSURE THAT WE

03:41:18.832 --> 03:41:30.944 region:rollup2
ARE.

03:41:30.043 --> 03:41:31.545 region:rollup2
MAKING AND. BEST USE. YOU KNOW

03:41:30.944 --> 03:41:32.179 region:rollup2
IT DOCTORS WHO I USED TO WORK

03:41:31.545 --> 03:41:32.880 region:rollup2
WITH WORK CONTRACTED FOR AFTER

03:41:32.179 --> 03:41:33.981 region:rollup2
DAY A MONTH. AND FRANKLY IS THAT

03:41:32.880 --> 03:41:34.915 region:rollup2
A FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS WORTH OF

03:41:33.981 --> 03:41:37.284 region:rollup2
THE PHYSICIAN.

03:41:34.915 --> 03:41:38.585 region:rollup2
OR IS THAT CHECKING A BOX AND SO

03:41:37.284 --> 03:41:39.887 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT OUR

03:41:38.585 --> 03:41:41.021 region:rollup2
NETWORKS ARE ADEQUATE.

03:41:39.887 --> 03:41:42.122 region:rollup2
SO I CAN TO THAT TO TALK ABOUT

03:41:41.021 --> 03:41:44.057 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESS BUT I WILL DEFER TO

03:41:42.122 --> 03:41:45.325 region:rollup2
DH CS TO DISCUSS THEIR PROCESS

03:41:44.057 --> 03:41:47.127 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T HAVE A LEVEL OF

03:41:45.325 --> 03:41:48.762 region:rollup2
DETAIL THAT INDICATES THAT IT'S

03:41:47.127 --> 03:41:50.264 region:rollup2
TO TWO DAYS A MONTH THAT THE

03:41:48.762 --> 03:41:52.266 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT YOU DESCRIBED.

03:41:50.264 --> 03:41:54.201 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE DO DO IS WE LOOK AT

03:41:52.266 --> 03:41:55.903 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE A PROVIDER HOWEVER

03:41:54.201 --> 03:41:58.205 region:rollup2
HOW MANY NETWORKS HERE SHE MAY

03:41:55.903 --> 03:42:00.174 region:rollup2
BE CONTRACTED AND SO LET'S SAY.

03:41:58.205 --> 03:42:02.643 region:rollup2
ANYONE PROVIDER IS CONTRACTED

03:42:00.174 --> 03:42:04.311 region:rollup2
INTO NETWORKS WE ASSIGN A TEN

03:42:02.643 --> 03:42:05.612 region:rollup2
PERCENT FD TO THAT PROVIDER

03:42:04.311 --> 03:42:08.081 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE NO OTHER DATA TO

03:42:05.612 --> 03:42:09.583 region:rollup2
INDICATE WHAT ACTUAL PERCENTAGE

03:42:08.081 --> 03:42:10.250 region:rollup2
IN IT MAY BE UNFAIR TO CERTAIN

03:42:09.583 --> 03:42:12.386 region:rollup2
PLANTS THEY MAY BE GETTING SHORT

03:42:10.250 --> 03:42:13.887 region:rollup2
SHRIFT THAT. THEY MAY HAVE FORTY

03:42:12.386 --> 03:42:15.022 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THAT ONE PROVIDERS

03:42:13.887 --> 03:42:16.557 region:rollup2
TIME BUT WERE ONLY GIVING THEM

03:42:15.022 --> 03:42:19.193 region:rollup2
CREDIT FOR TEN BECAUSE THEIR

03:42:16.557 --> 03:42:20.427 region:rollup2
INTENT NETWORKS THAT'S THE BEST

03:42:19.193 --> 03:42:21.862 region:rollup2
DATA LEVEL THAT WE HAVE SO.

03:42:20.427 --> 03:42:24.565 region:rollup2
DETECTING THE BOXES YOU

03:42:21.862 --> 03:42:24.998 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED THE ONE FTE FOR EVERY

03:42:24.565 --> 03:42:26.934 region:rollup2
SINGLE.

03:42:24.998 --> 03:42:28.869 region:rollup2
NETWORK THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOWS

03:42:26.934 --> 03:42:30.137 region:rollup2
UP AND IS NOT THE WAY WE PERFORM

03:42:28.869 --> 03:42:32.406 region:rollup2
NETWORK ADEQUACY BUT THERE'S NO

03:42:30.137 --> 03:42:33.507 region:rollup2
WAY WE CAN GET BECAUSE WE DON'T

03:42:32.406 --> 03:42:34.975 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DATA THAT

03:42:33.507 --> 03:42:37.344 region:rollup2
IT'S TWO DAYS A MONTH SO WE DO A

03:42:34.975 --> 03:42:38.879 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONALITY ASSESSMENT BASED

03:42:37.344 --> 03:42:40.814 region:rollup2
ON THE NUMBER OF MANAGED CARE

03:42:38.879 --> 03:42:43.450 region:rollup2
NETWORKS THAT INDIVIDUAL. ISN'T

03:42:40.814 --> 03:42:46.820 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE AND ONE YOU COUNT

03:42:43.450 --> 03:42:47.254 region:rollup2
THEM AS A FIDDLE IF THERE AND

03:42:46.820 --> 03:42:47.788 region:rollup2
ONE EVEN.

03:42:47.254 --> 03:42:48.188 region:rollup2
BUT SINCE ALL MANAGED CARE

03:42:47.788 --> 03:42:49.056 region:rollup2
PLANS.

03:42:48.188 --> 03:42:49.690 region:rollup2
UNDER OUR JURISDICTION REPORT

03:42:49.056 --> 03:42:50.757 region:rollup2

HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE

03:42:50.757 --> 03:42:53.727 region:rollup2
PENETRATION OF MANAGED CARE

03:42:52.092 --> 03:42:55.796 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS THAT EACH PROVIDER

03:42:53.727 --> 03:42:56.597 region:rollup2

HOW MANY FEE FOR SERVICE

03:42:56.597 --> 03:43:00.334 region:rollup2
PATIENTS. THEY MAY SEE OUTSIDE

03:42:58.465 --> 03:43:01.869 region:rollup2
OF A MANAGED CARE NETWORK THAT'S

03:43:00.334 --> 03:43:02.469 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA TELL US MEDICARE

03:43:01.869 --> 03:43:04.137 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MEDICARE.

03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:05.872 region:rollup2

03:43:04.137 --> 03:43:07.674 region:rollup2
UNDER OUR JURISDICTION BUT IT

03:43:05.872 --> 03:43:09.009 region:rollup2
WILL TELL US BY KNOX CONNECT

IT'LL TELL US THE COMMERCIAL

03:43:10.577 --> 03:43:13.814 region:rollup2
LINES OF BUSINESS.

03:43:11.979 --> 03:43:19.019 region:rollup2
HOW MANY PLANS ARE CURRENTLY

03:43:13.814 --> 03:43:19.920 region:rollup2
UNDER CORRECTIVE ACTIONS?

03:43:19.019 --> 03:43:21.188 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO FALL BACK

CORRECT INFORMATION.

03:43:26.827 --> 03:43:29.997 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE ALSO

03:43:28.562 --> 03:43:31.398 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO DO ANY AUDITS AS I

03:43:29.997 --> 03:43:32.833 region:rollup2
MENTIONED AND IF THERE'S ONE

03:43:31.398 --> 03:43:34.768 region:rollup2
FINDING IT AND NOT IT THEN THERE

03:43:32.833 --> 03:43:35.602 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A CORRECTIVE ACTION

03:43:34.768 --> 03:43:39.373 region:rollup2
PLAN FOR THAT HEALTH PLAN AND SO

03:43:35.602 --> 03:43:40.007 region:rollup2

LEAST TEN HEALTH PLANS UNDER

03:43:55.455 --> 03:43:58.659 region:rollup2
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN BECAUSE

03:44:17.978 --> 03:44:20.914 region:rollup2
IF A PLAN IS ON A CORRECTIVE

03:44:19.079 --> 03:44:22.015 region:rollup2
ACTION PLAN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT

DATA CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN AND

03:44:53.380 --> 03:44:56.583 region:rollup2
ONE MAY ALSO BE AN OVERLAPPING

03:44:55.449 --> 03:44:58.051 region:rollup2
ONE WITH THE SENTIMENT ISSUE

03:44:56.583 --> 03:44:58.652 region:rollup2
JUST KIND OF DEPEND SO WE CAN

03:44:59.686 --> 03:45:06.126 region:rollup2
BETTER DETAIL WITH THAT.

03:45:03.857 --> 03:45:07.961 region:rollup2
VOTERS A CORRECTION. CORRECTIVE

03:45:06.126 --> 03:45:09.396 region:rollup2
ACTION PLAN ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE.

03:45:07.961 --> 03:45:11.198 region:rollup2
WELL IN A IN IT'S GONNA IT'S

03:45:09.396 --> 03:45:12.599 region:rollup2

SPELL THAT OUT FOR US.

03:45:14.534 --> 03:45:18.071 region:rollup2
SURE SO CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN

03:45:16.370 --> 03:45:20.273 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY INCLUDES.

03:45:18.071 --> 03:45:21.641 region:rollup2
A PLAN OF ACTION AND THAT THE

03:45:20.273 --> 03:45:22.843 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN HAS SUBMITTED TO US

03:45:21.641 --> 03:45:24.745 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE HAVE APPROVED IT

03:45:22.843 --> 03:45:26.279 region:rollup2
INCLUDES SPECIFIC MILESTONES IN

03:45:24.745 --> 03:45:27.647 region:rollup2
TIME LINES THAT THE HEALTH PLAN

03:45:26.279 --> 03:45:29.349 region:rollup2
MUST COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH

03:45:27.647 --> 03:45:30.650 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENTS WITH. AND IF

03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:31.985 region:rollup2
THEY DO NOT COME INTO COMPLIANCE

03:45:30.650 --> 03:45:33.553 region:rollup2
THEM WE CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL

03:45:31.985 --> 03:45:36.056 region:rollup2
STEPS SUCH AS WE COULD STOP.

03:45:33.553 --> 03:45:37.624 region:rollup2
ASSIGNMENT TO THEM OR WE COULD

03:45:36.056 --> 03:45:39.326 region:rollup2
IMPOSE FINANCIAL SANCTION.

03:45:37.624 --> 03:45:40.060 region:rollup2
THE THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN

03:45:39.326 --> 03:45:42.029 region:rollup2
THAT WE MADE.

03:45:40.060 --> 03:45:43.663 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND WE SHARED WITH THE

03:45:42.029 --> 03:45:45.766 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN THE FALL RELATING

03:45:43.663 --> 03:45:47.501 region:rollup2
TO THE CENTER MADDEN EHS

03:45:45.766 --> 03:45:48.668 region:rollup2
ISSUE IS A IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

03:45:47.501 --> 03:45:50.037 region:rollup2
WHAT A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN

03:45:48.668 --> 03:45:52.439 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A FINDING.

03:45:50.037 --> 03:45:54.408 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS THIS HAS HAPPENED AND

03:45:52.439 --> 03:45:55.509 region:rollup2
THEN BEEN OUR RECOMMENDATION OR

03:45:54.408 --> 03:45:56.710 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REQUIRING

03:45:55.509 --> 03:45:58.044 region:rollup2
THE PLANTS YOU WHICH IS YOU HAVE

03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:59.913 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS BY A CERTAIN TIME YOU

03:45:58.044 --> 03:46:01.448 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FILE. THIS KIND OF

03:45:59.913 --> 03:46:02.983 region:rollup2
REPORT YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE THIS

03:46:01.448 --> 03:46:04.084 region:rollup2
KIND OF A TRANSITION PLAN AND

03:46:02.983 --> 03:46:05.552 region:rollup2
THE CASE THAT WE WERE MOVING

03:46:04.084 --> 03:46:07.387 region:rollup2
MEMBERS FROM ONE MEDICAL GROUP

03:46:05.552 --> 03:46:09.089 region:rollup2
TO ANOTHER. ON YOU HAVE TO MEET

03:46:07.387 --> 03:46:10.023 region:rollup2
THE CERTAIN KINDS OF METRICS OR

03:46:09.089 --> 03:46:12.025 region:rollup2
WE REQUIRE THEM TO COME BACK

03:46:10.023 --> 03:46:13.827 region:rollup2
WITH. DOCUMENTATION JUST DEPENDS

03:46:12.025 --> 03:46:15.429 region:rollup2
ON WHAT THEY'RE BEING PUT UNDER

03:46:13.827 --> 03:46:17.330 region:rollup2
A PLAN FOR ENCOUNTER DATA THAT

03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:21.268 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A PLAN THAT WE.

03:46:17.330 --> 03:46:26.573 region:rollup2
PENALIZED FOR FIVE MILLION

03:46:21.268 --> 03:46:29.910 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR REPEATED.

03:46:26.573 --> 03:46:32.579 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS AND THEIR INABILITY

03:46:29.910 --> 03:46:34.581 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE US ENCOUNTER DATA AND

03:46:32.579 --> 03:46:34.981 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THAT.

03:46:34.581 --> 03:46:35.348 region:rollup2
PENALTY FINALLY.

03:46:34.981 --> 03:46:35.615 region:rollup2
CORRECTED THE.

03:46:35.348 --> 03:46:36.249 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

03:46:35.615 --> 03:46:36.750 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PLANS THAT

03:46:36.249 --> 03:46:37.050 region:rollup2
ARE FOUND TO BE OUT OF

03:46:36.750 --> 03:46:38.752 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE?

03:46:37.050 --> 03:46:39.853 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS

03:46:38.752 --> 03:46:41.655 region:rollup2
AND WE DO HAVE A DEFAULT

03:46:39.853 --> 03:46:43.023 region:rollup2
ASSIGNMENT PROCESS WHERE A

03:46:41.655 --> 03:46:44.691 region:rollup2
CERTAIN NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES

03:46:43.023 --> 03:46:46.026 region:rollup2
ARE ASSIGNED TO A HEALTH PLAN

03:46:44.691 --> 03:46:48.528 region:rollup2
AND EACH MONTH IF.

03:46:46.026 --> 03:46:49.463 region:rollup2
IN SO WE CAN TAKE STEPS TO SAY

03:46:48.528 --> 03:46:51.064 region:rollup2
THAT ASSIGNMENT CAN'T HAPPEN

03:46:49.463 --> 03:46:52.332 region:rollup2
ANYMORE AND SO WE ARE GOING TO

03:46:51.064 --> 03:46:54.534 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ANY NEW BENEFICIARIES TO

03:46:52.332 --> 03:46:54.968 region:rollup2
ON AN ONGOING BASIS WE ALSO CAN

03:46:54.534 --> 03:46:56.470 region:rollup2
IMPOSE.

03:46:54.968 --> 03:46:57.370 region:rollup2
SANCTIONS AS JENNIFER CAN'T

03:46:56.470 --> 03:46:58.905 region:rollup2
JUST MENTIONED.

03:46:57.370 --> 03:47:00.574 region:rollup2
WE DID SANCTION ONE HEALTH PLAN

03:46:58.905 --> 03:47:02.209 region:rollup2
FOR UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

03:47:00.574 --> 03:47:03.844 region:rollup2
THIS PAST YEAR AND SO WE CAN

03:47:02.209 --> 03:47:05.512 region:rollup2
TAKE FINANCIAL SANCTIONS AS WELL

03:47:03.844 --> 03:47:06.480 region:rollup2
HOW LONG THE STORK LEE HAS THE

03:47:05.512 --> 03:47:07.447 region:rollup2
STATE.

03:47:06.480 --> 03:47:09.783 region:rollup2
TAKEN BEFORE SERIOUS

03:47:07.447 --> 03:47:10.884 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF.

03:47:09.783 --> 03:47:13.353 region:rollup2
THE FAILURE TO MEET THE

03:47:10.884 --> 03:47:14.955 region:rollup2
STATUTORY WOULDN'T REQUIREMENTS

03:47:13.353 --> 03:47:16.523 region:rollup2
OF THE KNOX KEEN HOW LONG

03:47:14.955 --> 03:47:17.724 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY HASN'T TAKEN FOR US

03:47:16.523 --> 03:47:19.926 region:rollup2
TO GET INTO IT DEPENDS ON THE

03:47:17.724 --> 03:47:22.395 region:rollup2
SEVERITY OF THAT ACTION I KNOW

03:47:19.926 --> 03:47:24.598 region:rollup2
THAT WE AS TO DEPARTMENTS WORKED

03:47:22.395 --> 03:47:25.699 region:rollup2
ON. A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD

03:47:24.598 --> 03:47:28.068 region:rollup2
A PLAN REACHED

03:47:25.699 --> 03:47:30.070 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNING LEVELS OF

03:47:28.068 --> 03:47:31.304 region:rollup2
FISCAL AND AND INTEGRITY THEY

03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:34.274 region:rollup2
HAVE LEFT THEIR RESERVES DROPPED

03:47:31.304 --> 03:47:35.742 region:rollup2
TO. DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS AND

03:47:34.274 --> 03:47:36.309 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH

03:47:35.742 --> 03:47:37.377 region:rollup2
CARE PUT A TEMPORARY MONITOR

03:47:36.309 --> 03:47:40.147 region:rollup2
AND.

03:47:37.377 --> 03:47:42.749 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS.

03:47:40.147 --> 03:47:43.617 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT WE AS A STATE CAN

03:47:42.749 --> 03:47:45.218 region:rollup2
TAKE.

03:47:43.617 --> 03:47:46.720 region:rollup2
ACTION ON THE PLAN AND THEN THE

03:47:45.218 --> 03:47:48.155 region:rollup2
OTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS

03:47:46.720 --> 03:47:49.856 region:rollup2
ARE CERTAINLY FAR MORE.

03:47:48.155 --> 03:47:51.658 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR ENCOUNTER

03:47:49.856 --> 03:47:52.993 region:rollup2
DATA OR WE WENT IN AND LOOKED AT

03:47:51.658 --> 03:47:54.561 region:rollup2
YOUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

03:47:52.993 --> 03:47:55.529 region:rollup2
WHEN WE AUDITED YOU AND YOU HAD

03:47:54.561 --> 03:47:57.464 region:rollup2
UPDATED YOUR POLICIES AND

03:47:55.529 --> 03:47:58.999 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES AND SO. DEPENDING ON

03:47:57.464 --> 03:48:00.901 region:rollup2
THE SEVERITY AND THAT.

03:47:58.999 --> 03:48:02.402 region:rollup2
EITHER THE COMPLETE THE QUICK

03:48:00.901 --> 03:48:03.837 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE BY THE PLAN OR THE

03:48:02.402 --> 03:48:05.338 region:rollup2
LACK OF COMPLIANCE KIND OF

03:48:03.837 --> 03:48:07.274 region:rollup2
DETERMINES WHAT ARE ACTION IS

03:48:05.338 --> 03:48:09.843 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE PLANS REACTION

03:48:07.274 --> 03:48:12.212 region:rollup2
AND SO.

03:48:09.843 --> 03:48:14.214 region:rollup2
WE CAN MOVE ON QUICKLY OR WE CAN

03:48:12.212 --> 03:48:15.582 region:rollup2
TAKE LONGER DEPENDING BUT I

03:48:14.214 --> 03:48:16.516 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY USUALLY WHEN A

03:48:15.582 --> 03:48:18.485 region:rollup2
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IS

03:48:16.516 --> 03:48:19.319 region:rollup2
IMPOSED WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE

03:48:18.485 --> 03:48:22.355 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

03:48:19.319 --> 03:48:24.324 region:rollup2
BACK USUALLY WITHIN THIRTY

03:48:22.355 --> 03:48:26.626 region:rollup2
THIRTY DAYS IF IT SEE AND NON

03:48:24.324 --> 03:48:27.894 region:rollup2
URGENT ISSUE ON MORE URGENT

03:48:26.626 --> 03:48:29.729 region:rollup2
ISSUES WE REQUIRE AND SOMETIMES.

03:48:27.894 --> 03:48:31.164 region:rollup2
GIVE US SOMETHING IN A WEEK.

03:48:29.729 --> 03:48:32.732 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOMETHING MORE. MORE

03:48:31.164 --> 03:48:34.234 region:rollup2
TIMELY.

03:48:32.732 --> 03:48:36.303 region:rollup2
IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD

03:48:34.234 --> 03:48:37.904 region:rollup2
FROM THE ADVOCATES IN THE FIRST

03:48:36.303 --> 03:48:40.006 region:rollup2
PANEL AND I DON'T WANNA ADD MY

03:48:37.904 --> 03:48:42.409 region:rollup2
ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE OF FIFTY

03:48:40.006 --> 03:48:44.211 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PATIENTS AS WELL BUT.

03:48:42.409 --> 03:48:47.314 region:rollup2
SOME OF US WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE

03:48:44.211 --> 03:48:49.950 region:rollup2
FRONT LINES FEEL FIRST HAND WHAT

03:48:47.314 --> 03:48:51.885 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE NETWORKS LOOK LIKE.

03:48:49.950 --> 03:48:52.819 region:rollup2
AND I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE

03:48:51.885 --> 03:48:54.921 region:rollup2
FROM YOU DO YOU HAVE ALL THE

03:48:52.819 --> 03:48:56.289 region:rollup2
TOOLS THAT YOU FEEL YOU NEED AS

03:48:54.921 --> 03:48:57.424 region:rollup2
A DEPARTMENT.

03:48:56.289 --> 03:48:59.192 region:rollup2
OR WHAT COULD WE AS A

03:48:57.424 --> 03:49:00.660 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DUE TO HELP WORK

03:48:59.192 --> 03:49:02.495 region:rollup2
WITH YOU.

03:49:00.660 --> 03:49:04.864 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH PLANS

03:49:02.495 --> 03:49:06.199 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS.

03:49:04.864 --> 03:49:08.468 region:rollup2
CAN DEVELOP AN ACCEPTABLE RATE

03:49:06.199 --> 03:49:10.170 region:rollup2
OF COMPLIANCE.

03:49:08.468 --> 03:49:12.305 region:rollup2
I THINK IT JENNIFER ALLUDED TO

03:49:10.170 --> 03:49:15.041 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT WE HAVE SUPPORT

03:49:12.305 --> 03:49:16.042 region:rollup2
BROADLY WHICH IS INVESTMENTS IN.

03:49:15.041 --> 03:49:16.943 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE

03:49:16.042 --> 03:49:18.578 region:rollup2
PROVIDER SHORTAGES

03:49:16.943 --> 03:49:20.780 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S OUTSIDE OF BOTH OF OUR

03:49:18.578 --> 03:49:21.381 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS BUT WE ASK OF THE

03:49:20.780 --> 03:49:22.582 region:rollup2
COMETS AND JENNIFER MADE THAT

03:49:21.381 --> 03:49:24.484 region:rollup2
WE.

03:49:22.582 --> 03:49:26.052 region:rollup2
AS A STATE AS A A LARGER GROUP

03:49:24.484 --> 03:49:27.687 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER

03:49:26.052 --> 03:49:29.556 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE

03:49:27.687 --> 03:49:31.758 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BOTH DOCUMENTED AREAS

03:49:29.556 --> 03:49:33.293 region:rollup2
AND IN THE VERY RURAL AREAS THAT

03:49:31.758 --> 03:49:34.828 region:rollup2
JENNIFER MENTIONED BUT ALSO. IN

03:49:33.293 --> 03:49:36.296 region:rollup2
SOME URBAN AREAS WHERE

03:49:34.828 --> 03:49:37.931 region:rollup2
PENETRATION OF CERTAIN PROVIDER

03:49:36.296 --> 03:49:39.265 region:rollup2
TYPES IS NOT AVAILABLE EVEN

03:49:37.931 --> 03:49:41.001 region:rollup2
CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF IT OF AN

03:49:39.265 --> 03:49:42.802 region:rollup2
URBAN POPULATION AND BECAUSE

03:49:41.001 --> 03:49:43.637 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION CAN BE AN ISSUE

03:49:42.802 --> 03:49:45.972 region:rollup2
THAT CONCRETE BARRIERS TO CARE

03:49:43.637 --> 03:49:47.407 region:rollup2
WHICH. AREN'T REALLY OBVIOUS YOU

03:49:45.972 --> 03:49:48.475 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S REALLY OBVIOUS WHEN

03:49:47.407 --> 03:49:50.343 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A COUNTY OF SEVENTEEN

03:49:48.475 --> 03:49:51.344 region:rollup2
HUNDRED IS AN OBVIOUS WHEN

03:49:50.343 --> 03:49:53.079 region:rollup2
YOU'RE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF LOS

03:49:51.344 --> 03:49:54.381 region:rollup2
ANGELES AS AN EXAMPLE. SO I I

03:49:53.079 --> 03:49:55.015 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY THINK WORKING

03:49:54.381 --> 03:49:56.683 region:rollup2
TOGETHER ON PROVIDERS SHORTAGE

03:49:55.015 --> 03:49:58.451 region:rollup2
ISSUES IS AN AREA THAT WE CAN

03:49:56.683 --> 03:50:00.353 region:rollup2
ALL GET BEHIND AND I WOULD BE

03:49:58.451 --> 03:50:02.055 region:rollup2
REMISS IF I DID NOT TAKE THIS

03:50:00.353 --> 03:50:04.324 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO MENTION THAT WITH

03:50:02.055 --> 03:50:05.592 region:rollup2
PROP FIFTY SIX WE HAD PLACED

03:50:04.324 --> 03:50:06.459 region:rollup2
MONEY AND FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL

03:50:05.592 --> 03:50:08.395 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

03:50:06.459 --> 03:50:10.363 region:rollup2
AND THAT MONEY COULD GREATLY

03:50:08.395 --> 03:50:12.065 region:rollup2
HELP US MEET SOME OF THE NETWORK

03:50:10.363 --> 03:50:13.867 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY ISSUES THAT WE ARE

03:50:12.065 --> 03:50:16.403 region:rollup2
FACING AS A STATE. AND WOULD

03:50:13.867 --> 03:50:18.371 region:rollup2
IMPLORE YOU TO HELP US TO.

03:50:16.403 --> 03:50:19.673 region:rollup2
WORK FOR THOSE FUNDS TO SEE HOW

LITTLE GIRL IN MY DISTRICT DIED.

FLUAND YET ANOTHER INFECTION.

03:53:47.514 --> 03:53:50.984 region:rollup2
AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

IT HURT SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN

03:53:50.984 --> 03:53:55.154 region:rollup2
VALLEY.

03:53:52.819 --> 03:53:57.957 region:rollup2
IT TAKES OVER A WEEK.

03:53:55.154 --> 03:53:59.125 region:rollup2
TO GET IN TO SEE A DOC.

03:53:57.957 --> 03:54:00.760 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S SEVERAL ISSUES GOING

03:53:59.125 --> 03:54:03.062 region:rollup2
ON.

03:54:00.760 --> 03:54:05.398 region:rollup2
AND WHAT CONCERNS ME IS ON ONE

03:54:03.062 --> 03:54:06.1000 region:rollup2
SIDE WE HAVE. A LACK OF

03:54:05.398 --> 03:54:08.768 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS.

SELECT YOUR SPEAK PLAIN ENGLISH

03:54:08.768 --> 03:54:12.639 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL LACK OF DOCTORS.

03:54:11.304 --> 03:54:13.139 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL PIECES OF

03:54:12.639 --> 03:54:15.775 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT OF MOVE

03:54:13.139 --> 03:54:17.577 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

03:54:15.775 --> 03:54:19.312 region:rollup2
THESE HOUSES

03:54:17.577 --> 03:54:20.713 region:rollup2
THE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE

03:54:19.312 --> 03:54:22.415 region:rollup2
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE OVER

03:54:20.713 --> 03:54:23.950 region:rollup2
THE LAST FOUR YEARS. TO ADDRESS

03:54:22.415 --> 03:54:25.018 region:rollup2
THAT PROBLEM AND NOT ONE OF THEM

03:54:23.950 --> 03:54:26.052 region:rollup2
IS MANAGED TO GET TO THE

03:54:25.018 --> 03:54:28.454 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S DESK TO GET SIGNED.

03:54:26.052 --> 03:54:31.090 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

03:54:28.454 --> 03:54:32.692 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT.

03:54:31.090 --> 03:54:33.559 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

03:54:32.692 --> 03:54:36.629 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

03:54:33.559 --> 03:54:39.098 region:rollup2
SO. WE WE HAVE THE PLANS

03:54:36.629 --> 03:54:40.833 region:rollup2

THAT BEING ADJUSTED FOR.

03:54:44.537 --> 03:54:47.307 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF ALL THE PLANS ARE

03:54:46.239 --> 03:54:48.942 region:rollup2

CHANGE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL

04:00:16.669 --> 04:00:17.970 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN PROVIDERS

04:00:17.270 --> 04:00:19.138 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE MEDICAL GROUPS THAT YOU

04:00:17.970 --> 04:00:20.673 region:rollup2

04:00:19.138 --> 04:00:22.108 region:rollup2
OF ALL OF THEIR PROVIDERS WITHIN

04:00:20.673 --> 04:00:24.477 region:rollup2
THEIR NETWORK. I DON'T THINK

04:00:22.108 --> 04:00:25.945 region:rollup2
THAT ANY ONE SITTING IN ANY ONE

04:00:24.477 --> 04:00:27.246 region:rollup2

COMPLETE AND TOTAL TRANSPARENCY

04:00:32.551 --> 04:00:35.421 region:rollup2
AND HOW THOSE FINANCIAL

04:00:33.386 --> 04:00:37.790 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS ARE MADE. I WOULD

04:00:35.421 --> 04:00:39.925 region:rollup2
ONLY KNOW ABOUT MEDI CAL I WOULD

04:00:37.790 --> 04:00:42.161 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT IS ON

04:00:39.925 --> 04:00:43.930 region:rollup2
THE COMMERCIAL SIDE AND SO

04:00:42.161 --> 04:00:45.698 region:rollup2
THERE'S A VARIETY OF KIND OF

04:00:43.930 --> 04:00:47.800 region:rollup2
LAYERS OF TRANSPARENCY THAT I

04:00:45.698 --> 04:00:49.402 region:rollup2
KNOW. THERE HAVE BEEN BILLS IN

04:00:47.800 --> 04:00:51.270 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO GET AT

04:00:49.402 --> 04:00:52.738 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN

04:00:51.270 --> 04:00:53.039 region:rollup2
THOSE HAVE.

04:00:52.738 --> 04:00:53.706 region:rollup2
ALSO BEEN.

04:00:53.039 --> 04:00:56.008 region:rollup2
NOT SUCCESSFUL AND SO. YOU KNOW

04:00:53.706 --> 04:00:57.610 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE PLANS TO

SET YOU KNOW WE NEGOTIATE RATES

04:00:57.610 --> 04:01:00.246 region:rollup2
WITH THE PLANS AND WHEN I SAY

04:00:59.211 --> 04:01:01.914 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE WE DON'T REALLY.

04:01:00.246 --> 04:01:03.249 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE AS WE TAKE THEIR

04:01:01.914 --> 04:01:04.884 region:rollup2
ENCOUNTER DATA AND THEIR COSTS

04:01:03.249 --> 04:01:06.519 region:rollup2
IN THEIR UTILIZATION OUR

04:01:04.884 --> 04:01:08.187 region:rollup2
ACTUARIES TREND THAT.

04:01:06.519 --> 04:01:09.388 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE GIVE THE PLANS RATE

04:01:08.187 --> 04:01:10.790 region:rollup2
AND SAY THIS IS WHAT YOUR RATE'S

04:01:09.388 --> 04:01:13.859 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE FOR THIS ELIGIBILITY

04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:14.493 region:rollup2
CATEGORY IN THE GIVEN YEAR. AND

04:01:13.859 --> 04:01:15.428 region:rollup2
THEY CAN DISPUTE WHETHER WE HAVE

04:01:14.493 --> 04:01:17.129 region:rollup2
A.

04:01:15.428 --> 04:01:18.097 region:rollup2
AND I MATH ERROR YOU KNOW LIKE

04:01:17.129 --> 04:01:19.365 region:rollup2
WE DON'T THINK YOU CALCULATED

04:01:18.097 --> 04:01:20.733 region:rollup2
THIS TREND OR WE DON'T LIKE THE

04:01:19.365 --> 04:01:23.269 region:rollup2
WAY YOU TRENDED IT. BUT.

04:01:20.733 --> 04:01:25.905 region:rollup2
OUR ENTIRE RATES PROCESS IS

04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:26.472 region:rollup2
BASED ON A PLANS ACTUAL ON

04:01:25.905 --> 04:01:29.008 region:rollup2
ENCOUNTER COSTS UTILIZATION

04:01:26.472 --> 04:01:31.310 region:rollup2
DATA.

04:01:29.008 --> 04:01:32.945 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT AND

04:01:31.310 --> 04:01:34.580 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO KIND OF TELL IT

04:01:32.945 --> 04:01:35.881 region:rollup2
THAT MUCH MORE KIND OF. LARGER

04:01:34.580 --> 04:01:37.616 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

04:01:35.881 --> 04:01:39.352 region:rollup2
DAMAGE SEE DOES IN THEIR

04:01:37.616 --> 04:01:40.886 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AUDITS BUT IF THE

04:01:39.352 --> 04:01:42.054 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATES ARE EVEN HARDER

04:01:40.886 --> 04:01:43.155 region:rollup2
TO ASSESS.

04:01:42.054 --> 04:01:44.824 region:rollup2
I WOULD AGREE WITH JENNIFER WE

04:01:43.155 --> 04:01:46.459 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL

04:01:44.824 --> 04:01:47.927 region:rollup2
PROVIDER RATES PAID OR

04:01:46.459 --> 04:01:50.496 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CAPITATED OVER A

04:01:47.927 --> 04:01:52.298 region:rollup2
RATES PAID WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO

04:01:50.496 --> 04:01:53.899 region:rollup2
IS THE OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH

04:01:52.298 --> 04:01:55.368 region:rollup2
OF ABOUT THE PLANTS AND THE

04:01:53.899 --> 04:01:57.103 region:rollup2
MEDICAL GROUPS FOR ABOUT WITH.

04:01:55.368 --> 04:01:59.238 region:rollup2
WITH TO WHOM THEY DELEGATE RISK

04:01:57.103 --> 04:02:00.840 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A GOOD PICTURE OF HOW

04:01:59.238 --> 04:02:02.575 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING FINANCIALLY WHICH

04:02:00.840 --> 04:02:04.276 region:rollup2
IS HOW WE WERE ABLE TO CATCH THE

04:02:02.575 --> 04:02:05.778 region:rollup2
ISSUE. THAT THE DIRECTOR

04:02:04.276 --> 04:02:07.046 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER WITH ONE OF

04:02:05.778 --> 04:02:09.515 region:rollup2
THE PLANTS THAT WE BOTH HAVE A

04:02:07.046 --> 04:02:11.650 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH BUT WE ALSO.

04:02:09.515 --> 04:02:12.118 region:rollup2
RECEIVE MEDICAL US RADIO RATIO

04:02:11.650 --> 04:02:13.452 region:rollup2
IT.

04:02:12.118 --> 04:02:15.254 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM THE PLAN SO

04:02:13.452 --> 04:02:16.589 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO DOCUMENT FOR THE

04:02:15.254 --> 04:02:18.357 region:rollup2
PREMIUM THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING

04:02:16.589 --> 04:02:19.458 region:rollup2
WHAT HOW MUCH OF IT IS GOING TO

04:02:18.357 --> 04:02:21.694 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CARE.

04:02:19.458 --> 04:02:23.095 region:rollup2
AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS GOING TO

04:02:21.694 --> 04:02:24.296 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION PROFIT AND

04:02:23.095 --> 04:02:25.664 region:rollup2
THERE'S DIFFERENT STANDARDS SET

04:02:24.296 --> 04:02:27.033 region:rollup2
FOR MARKET TYPE SO ON THE

04:02:25.664 --> 04:02:29.001 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL SIDE IT'S EIGHTY FIVE

04:02:27.033 --> 04:02:30.236 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF YOUR PREMIUM. MUST GO

04:02:29.001 --> 04:02:31.437 region:rollup2
TO MEDICAL CARE QUALITY

04:02:30.236 --> 04:02:32.471 region:rollup2

04:02:32.471 --> 04:02:35.741 region:rollup2
ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL

04:02:34.440 --> 04:02:37.276 region:rollup2
GROUP SIDE IT'S EIGHTY PERCENT

04:02:35.741 --> 04:02:38.811 region:rollup2
AND SO WE PERIODICALLY CONDUCT

04:02:37.276 --> 04:02:40.146 region:rollup2
EXAMS WE GO ONSITE WE LOOK AT

04:02:38.811 --> 04:02:42.481 region:rollup2
THE MEDICAL RECORDS.

04:02:40.146 --> 04:02:44.016 region:rollup2

OR READ NOT MEDICAL RECORDS BUT

04:02:44.016 --> 04:02:47.887 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS

04:02:45.418 --> 04:02:49.121 region:rollup2
OF THE PLAN IN ORDER TO VALIDATE

04:02:47.887 --> 04:02:51.290 region:rollup2
THAT THEY YES HAVE CATEGORIZED

04:02:49.121 --> 04:02:52.525 region:rollup2
ALL THE EXPENSES CORRECTLY TO TO

04:02:51.290 --> 04:02:53.859 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SPENDING.

04:02:52.525 --> 04:02:54.827 region:rollup2

04:02:53.859 --> 04:02:56.495 region:rollup2

04:02:54.827 --> 04:02:58.564 region:rollup2
SPEND BUT WE DO WE DO NOT GET IN

04:02:56.495 --> 04:03:00.966 region:rollup2
ANY CAPACITY THE GRANULARITY OF

04:02:58.564 --> 04:03:02.768 region:rollup2
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. CLAIM OR AN

04:03:00.966 --> 04:03:04.804 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER THAT THIS IS

04:03:02.768 --> 04:03:07.073 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH THAT PERSONS BEING PAID

04:03:04.804 --> 04:03:08.974 region:rollup2
WE SEE THEIR CONTRACT. IN KIND

04:03:07.073 --> 04:03:10.643 region:rollup2
OF AN AGGREGATE WITHOUT NUMBERS

04:03:08.974 --> 04:03:12.545 region:rollup2
IN IT SO WE ENSURE THAT THE

04:03:10.643 --> 04:03:13.846 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROVIDER PROTECTIONS

04:03:12.545 --> 04:03:15.514 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ENSHRINED IN THE KNOX

04:03:13.846 --> 04:03:17.149 region:rollup2
KY DOCTORED HERE TOO SO THAT HAS

04:03:15.514 --> 04:03:19.218 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH. HOW THEY RECOUP

04:03:17.149 --> 04:03:20.686 region:rollup2

LATE PAYMENTS THAT SORT OF THING

04:03:25.091 --> 04:03:28.761 region:rollup2
BUT NOT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT WE

DON'T RECEIVE ANYTHING OF THAT

04:03:28.761 --> 04:03:29.695 region:rollup2
NATURE?

04:03:28.994 --> 04:03:30.563 region:rollup2
AND I PROMISED THAT WAS THE LAST

04:03:29.695 --> 04:03:31.530 region:rollup2
QUESTION SO I WILL LEAVE IT AT

04:03:30.563 --> 04:03:32.531 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:03:31.530 --> 04:03:34.166 region:rollup2
BUT DO WANT TO.

04:03:32.531 --> 04:03:35.134 region:rollup2
.

04:03:34.166 --> 04:03:36.869 region:rollup2
WORK WITH BOTH OF YOUR

04:03:35.134 --> 04:03:39.605 region:rollup2

IT PROVIDES US SOME OF THE

04:03:41.273 --> 04:03:44.677 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WE'RE SEEKING.

04:03:42.908 --> 04:03:46.545 region:rollup2
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IF THERE'S

04:03:44.677 --> 04:03:48.047 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE UPON IT

04:03:46.545 --> 04:03:50.149 region:rollup2
AND INSIST THAT WE ARE

04:03:48.047 --> 04:03:51.383 region:rollup2

04:10:25.477 --> 04:10:28.413 region:rollup2
THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY

GO THROUGH A NEW REVIEW TO
