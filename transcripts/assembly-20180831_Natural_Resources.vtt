00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:07.565
SAY THAT THAT'S THE DESIGN IN

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:09.000
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SERENA

00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:11.068
WILL NOT IMPACT RESIDENTS --

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:13.204
BUT YOU CAN EXPAND.

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:14.705
OSAMA MCCARTY GELANG

00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:16.674
REPRESENTING THE BRETT MURPHY

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:19.277
SPOLE.

00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:20.411
THE CLEAR SIMPLE ANSWER ON THE

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:21.579
RESIDENTS QUESTION IS THE

00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:23.047
AGREEMENT WE HAVE WITH THE CITY

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:24.081
WHICH IS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:27.752
PROHIBITS THE DESIGN OR USE OF

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:30.521
ANY RESIDENTIAL OR CHURCH

PROPERTIES WHATSOEVER SO JUST

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.157
PROHIBITED.

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:33.758
AND IT'S A LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.326
WE HAVE.

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:37.828
SECONDLY I THINK IMPORTANTLY.

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:40.164
THE QUESTION IS ABOUT TIMING.

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:44.201
SO FROM A TIMING STANDPOINT.

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:45.803
THIS IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.105

THAT WE HAVE THE DOORS OPEN BY.

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:57.315
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHEN YOU LOOK

00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:59.050
AT WHAT IT TAKES TO DO THAT.

00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:01.052
THAT SIX YEAR PERIOD.

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:02.987
THE FIRST TWO YEARS INVOLVE

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:03.287
[inaudible]

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:04.855
DESIGN.

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:06.791
YEAH I OUR WORK GETTING THROUGH

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:09.560
THE FINALIZATION OF THE I. R..

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:11.362
THE SECOND TWO YEAR PERIOD.

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.297
ALLOWS FOR BOTH THE LITIGATION

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:15.566
PERIOD AND OTHER CHANGES OF MY

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:16.601
NET TO BE MADE TO THE ARE BASED

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:18.002
ON THE MEDICATION.

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.070
THAT LEAVES YOU TWO YEARS TO

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:22.640
BUILD. TWO YEARS IS.

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:24.542
JUST ON THE RAGGED EDGE HERE IN

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:26.477
SACRAMENTO THEY HAD JUST OVER

00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:27.979
TWO YEARS TO BUILD IT AND LIKELY

00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:29.313
THEY MADE IT.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.415
IN OCTOBER BEFORE THE FIRST GAME

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:33.417
WAS REQUIRED TO BE DONE.

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:34.986
THAT'S THE TIMELINE WE FACE IF

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:37.154
WE CAN'T DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:39.123
MEET THAT TIMELINE AND IT REALLY

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.825
IS THAT SIMPLE TWO YEAR PERIOD

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:41.125
[inaudible]

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:43.561
THEN.

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:44.829
MISTER PALMER THE TEAM IN THE

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:45.529
NBA WILL BE FORCED TO LOOK.

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:47.298
ELSEWHERE.

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:48.466
AND SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:50.167
DEMONSTRATE THAT AND THAT'S THE

00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:52.003
NEED THAT'S WHY THE AB.

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:54.238
NINE SYSTEMS THAT WORK.

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:56.607
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE AB NINE

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:59.276
HUNDRED AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS.

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:01.646
COULD VERY WELL WOULD SUNSET

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:03.314
DURING OUR CERTIFICATION PARA.

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:05.816
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS.

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.718
IF THE CURRENT AB NINE HUNDRED

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:08.486
SUNSETS IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR

00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:10.621
CERTIFICATION PROCESS.

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.089
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WORKS

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:15.159
OR NOT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO AB.

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:15.926
NINE HUNDRED REQUIRES THAT WE

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:17.762
DEMONSTRATE.

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:18.896
WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:20.564
OPERATION THEY WERE IN A 15%

00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:22.867
VEHICLE TRIP PRODUCTION.

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:23.901
WE'RE IMAGE STRANDS AT STAR

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.302
COMMUNITY.

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:26.704
WE KNOW WE CAN'T MEET THAT

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:28.806
STANDARD IN THE FIRST YEAR.

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.141
WHAT THIS STILL BILL DOES IS

00:38:30.207 --> 00:38:31.909
ALLOW US SIX ADDITIONAL YEARS TO

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.678
MEET THAT STANDARD?

00:38:33.744 --> 00:38:35.046
AND THE PRICE FOR THAT SIX

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:37.114
ADDITIONAL YEARS IS ALL OF THESE

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.482
ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:39.750
IMPROVEMENTS THAT THIS BILL

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:41.585
INCLUDES.

00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:43.387
YOU'VE HEARD IT TALKED ABOUT.

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:44.955
THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF ANY OF

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.590
THESE BILLS HAS COME ALONG AND

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:47.958
AND IT TRULY IS SO THE ANSWER TO

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.727
THE QUESTION IS.

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:50.761
AB NINE HUNDRED DOES WORK

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.630
BECAUSE THE TIMING.

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:54.498
AND BECAUSE OF NEEDING THE EXTRA

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:57.001
TIME TO MEET THAT STANDARD.

00:38:57.068 --> 00:38:58.035
WHILE WE'RE DOING OTHER

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.937
ENVIRONMENTAL THINGS AND THE

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:02.106
RESIDENTS ISSUE IS IS IS DRIVING

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:04.475
THE DESIGN INCLUDES NO

AND OUR AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.879
SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS THE USE

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.448

YOUR COMMITTEE SELF NOT FELT

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:33.364
MORE COMFORTABLE IF IN THE BILL

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.865
WE WOULD ACTUALLY NAMED THE

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.700
PARCEL NUMBERS THAT ARE SUBJECT

THERE ARE IN FACT. TO

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.277
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:46.777
INVOLVED IN ONE OF THOSE

00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:49.013
PERSONAL.

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:50.181
THE CITY IS PROHIBIT US FROM

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:51.482
USING THEM AND ARE DESIGNED DOES

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:53.384
NOT INCLUDE THEM.

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.519
WE CAN'T HOWEVER LEGISLATIVELY

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:56.787
CARVE OUT A COUNTY ASSESSOR

00:40:56.854 --> 00:40:58.989
PARCEL NUMBER.

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:01.025
THE LEGISLATURE'S NOT AUTHORIZED

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:02.393
IF WE COULD WE WOULD DO THAT.

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:04.662
BUT WE CAN'T.

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:06.263
IF THOSE TWO RESIDENTIAL

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.032
PROPERTIES ONE AS A SINGLE THING

00:41:08.098 --> 00:41:09.800
HOUSE ONE IS A TRI PLEX.

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:10.968
IF THEY CHOOSE TO SELL WERE

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:12.703
HAPPY FOR THAT.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.172
IF THEY DON'T SELL THAT'S FINE.

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:16.674
TOO IT'S IT INVOLVES THE

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.842
DRIVEWAY FOR THE ENTRANCE FOR

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.276
ONE OF THE PARKING [inaudible]

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:21.612
STRUCTURES AND ONE STRUCTURES ON

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:23.781
EITHER SIDE.

00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:25.149
BUT THE CITIES OR PROHIBIT US

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:27.518
FROM USING FROM TAKING HIM.

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:29.253
AND THE DESIGN DOES NOT INCLUDE.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.454
AND SO THE THAT'S THE ANSWER TO

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:32.122
THAT.

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:34.258
WHY A ARE THOSE TWO RESIDENCES

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:35.593
IN PARCELS THAT INCLUDE THE

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:36.694
BILLS THAT WE CAN'T LEGISLATE

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.696
SPLIT THE PARCEL BUT THE CITY'S

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:40.397
PROHIBIT US FROM USING THEM AND

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:40.865
GIVE THAT THE DESIGN?

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:45.102
OR AN ATTACK [inaudible]

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:47.638
ALRIGHT OKAY.

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:50.774
SO I'M I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THIS

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.576
I'M NOT SIX BRING US TODAY THAT

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:54.879
LET YOU KNOW I'M DONE.

00:41:54.945 --> 00:41:55.479
I THINK I WANT TO SHARE A FEW

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:58.215
THINGS ON I ONE THAT THE TIMING

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:59.416
OF NINE HUNDRED I DON'T THINK

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:01.719
MATHEMATICALLY WORKS OUT BECAUSE

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:03.420
TEARS AND DESIGN TEARS

00:42:03.487 --> 00:42:05.289
CONSTRUCTIONS FOR YEARS.

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:08.158
AND THIS IS GOING TO TWENTY

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.860
EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR SIX YEARS.

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:11.395
THEN WE CAME HERE LAST YEAR

00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:13.430
THOSE OXY SEVEN YEARS SO.

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:15.866
SO SO FOR IT FOR THAT --

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:17.434
BUT I GUESS IT THAT THE BIGGER

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.803
PICTURE IS THAT --

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.338
AND YOU MENTION THIS TO IS IS

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:22.139
NINE HUNDRED MAY EXPIRE DURING

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.540
THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:25.242
LOOKING AT NINE HUNDRED BECAUSE

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:27.478
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:29.813
FOR INGLEWOOD IN LOS ANGELES.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.015
COUNTY -- A

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:33.217
BILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENT

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:35.719
THERE WITHOUT ONE PENNY PUBLIC

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.254
SUBSIDY IS SOMETHING TO BE.

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:39.356
APPLAUDED DOWN THE STREET WE

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:41.458
HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ARENA BUT IT'S

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:43.193
TAXPAYERS UNIT PAYING SEVEN

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.094
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:45.296
NEXT THIRTY YEARS.

00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:47.898
AND DEBT SERVICE SO HERE NO

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.466
PUBLIC SUBSIDY --

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:52.736
I TOTALLY GET THE SIGNIFICANCE.

00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:54.238
AND THAT AND THAT --

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:57.408
THE OVERALL CENTER THERE WITH --

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:58.642
THE RAMS FOOTBALL STADIUM UNDER

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.110
CONSTRUCTION.

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:01.578
BY JUST THINK IF YOU LOOK BACK

00:43:01.645 --> 00:43:04.381
IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHY WE

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:06.684
CREATED AB NINE HUNDRED BECAUSE

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:07.284
THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE WE'RE

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:08.218
HERE.

00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:09.119
WE DON'T LIKE PICKING WINNERS

00:43:09.186 --> 00:43:10.654
AND LOSERS.

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:12.690
WE DON'T LIKE PICKING THE PERSON

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:15.159
WITH THE BIGGEST CHECKBOOK.

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.327
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE.

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:18.128
CRYSTAL CLEAR.

00:43:18.195 --> 00:43:20.631
AND IT'S JUST I THINK REALLY

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:22.366
REALLY UNFORTUNATE.

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:24.802
AND I WOULD MUCH RATHER I AND I

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.503
KNOW THAT.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:27.638
NINE HUNDRED IS PROBLEMATIC FOR

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:28.906
YOU FOR A FEW REASONS AND I DID

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:30.240
HEAR YOU SAY THE LITIGATION

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:31.942
WOULD TAKE UP YEARS.

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:34.678
TO SO IT'S IT WOULD BE --

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:36.647
THE FACT THAT NINE HUNDRED MAY

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:38.749
EXPIRE THE NINE HUNDRED DOESN'T

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:40.317
ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT TRACK

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:41.485
TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS IN

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:42.820
THE FIRST YEAR.

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.254
I GET THAT I WOULD MUCH RATHER

00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:46.824
TODAY OPEN UP NINE HUNDRED AND

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:48.892
PUT THOSE NEW ELEMENTS IN

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:49.193
[inaudible]

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:50.961
NINE HUNDRED SO THEN.

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:52.229
THE GOVERNOR THROUGH THE ENTIRE

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:54.264
PROCESS CAN PICK THESE.

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:56.066
LEADERSHIP PROJECTS WHICH HAVE

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.668
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT --

00:43:57.735 --> 00:44:00.371
LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:02.139
AND HAVE A FAIR PROCESS WE DON'T

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:03.073
HAVE.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.274
TO DO THESE ONE OFFICE ONE AT A

00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:05.376
TIME BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:44:05.442 --> 00:44:06.810
LIST.

00:44:06.877 --> 00:44:09.380
WE'VE HAD A FEW SOME PROJECTS IN

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:11.181
PENCIL OUT OF LOS ANGELES.

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:12.816
TURNABOUT FARMER'S FIELD AND SO

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:14.218
FORTH SOME SOME HAVE.

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:16.820
SOME ARENA STADIUM PROJECTS HAVE

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:19.757
BEEN ABLE TO MATERIALIZE UNDER

00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:20.791
NINE HUNDRED SO IT'S JUST

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:23.460
EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING THAT WE

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:25.062
HAVE -- TO

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:26.563
PICK AND CHOOSE WINNERS AND

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:27.865
LOSERS IN THIS PROJECT WHEN

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:29.666
SMALLER PROJECTS WITHOUT THE

00:44:29.733 --> 00:44:31.635
RESOURCES DON'T HAVE THE

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:32.936
OPPORTUNITY TO COME UP HERE.

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:34.872
HIGHER ADVOCATES INCOME ADVOCATE

00:44:34.938 --> 00:44:36.440
FOR IT AND AGAIN.

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.175
THAT'S WHY WE CREATED NINE

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:39.510
HUNDRED TO MAKE A SIMPLIFIED

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:42.012
STATEWIDE --

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.914
PROCESS FOR FOR BIG ECONOMIC

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.249
DON'T PROJECTS I THINK OVER A

00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:47.351
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TWO

00:44:47.418 --> 00:44:49.853
OUGHT TO PARTICIPATE ON AND I I

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.588
GET TO THE POINT THAT YOU MAKE

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:52.823
IS CRYSTAL CLEAR SOME OF THE

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.491
PROJECTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:44:54.558 --> 00:44:59.263
ABLE. TO PARTICIPATE.

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.064
FOR NINE ARE VERY DIFFERENT

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:02.466
ECONOMICALLY.

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.268
AND DIVERSELY WISE THAN THE

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:05.669
PROJECT THAT YOU'RE REPRESENTING

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:07.371

MISTER CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLYMAN

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:28.011
REYES --

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.813
WE'RE NOT ONLY REQUIRED TO MEET

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.815
THE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:33.750
EMISSION STANDARDS.

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:35.652
THAT IS IT AB NINE HUNDRED BUT

00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:36.920
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE BILL

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:39.656
ACTUALLY REQUIRES THAT 50% OF

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:41.158
THE MITIGATION REQUIRED TO MEET

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:42.559
THAT STANDARD.

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:46.063
OCCUR LOCALLY IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:46.663
ITS FIRST TIME THAT STANDARDS

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.333
EVER BEEN APPLIED IN ADDITION.

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:53.370
WE'RE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS BOTH --

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:56.240
LOCKS EMISSIONS CAR MISSIONS AND

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:58.141
PARTICULATE EMISSIONS.

00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:00.410
WHICH AFFECT THE ENTIRE LA

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:03.013
REGION AND SO WERE REQUIRED TO

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.314
DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS THOSE

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:05.749
ARE NEW STANDARDS I THINK THE

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:06.917
COMMITTEE STAFF WOULD.

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:09.820
SURE HAVE NEVER BEEN APPLIED TO

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.455
A BILL LIKE THIS AND THEY ARE

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.357
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS HAVE.

00:48:13.423 --> 00:48:14.925
AND I NOTICED ALSO THAT IT WAS

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:17.694
SUBJECT TO A AND INVESTMENT CAP

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:19.963
[inaudible] THIRTY MILLION.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:24.568
HOW IS THAT AMOUNT REACHED AND?

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.770
WHY THE SEVEN REYES --

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:28.238
I THINK IT WAS REACHED BY

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:31.575
LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT OF

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:33.744
ADDITIONAL POLLUTION ON TOP OF

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.513
WHATEVER THE PROJECT WOULD

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.748
CREATE THE IDEA WAS.

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:39.750
WE NEED.

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.852
TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:43.854
POLLUTION IN THE AREA MINUS THE

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.455
PROJECT.

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:47.858
AND SO THERE WAS A TIME AGE GOAL

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:52.162
TO ME. FOUR HUNDRED TONS OF KNOX

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:56.233
EMISSIONS AND TEN TONS OF THE

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:56.767
TWO POINT FIVE PARTICULATE

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:58.669
EMISSIONS.

00:48:58.735 --> 00:49:01.138
AND SO THAT NUMBER WAS DERIVED

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:02.673
FROM THE FROM THE GOAL OF WHAT

00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:04.107
IT WOULD TAKE TO ACHIEVE THOSE

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:08.845
REDUCTION.

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:10.881
IF I MAY.

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:15.419
IT REVIEWING THE THE ANALYSIS --

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:17.921
THOSE PROVIDED TODAY AND THE THE

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.589
HISTORY ON THIS.

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:21.958

FIRST YOU SELECTED.

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:26.930
AND AN EXCELLENT AUTHOR.

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:28.965
I THINK HAVING ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:29.766
COME LONGER --

00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:31.668
DOVE.

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:33.637
ALL THROUGH THIS PROVIDED --

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:36.073
GREATER INSIGHT FOR ME ANYWAY TO

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:37.374
BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT I

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:41.345
CAN SPEAK WITH. TO TWO ANSWER

00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:42.012
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.980
EARLIER --

00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:46.083
AYE I DO WANT TO NOTE AS AN

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:47.517
ASIDE.
