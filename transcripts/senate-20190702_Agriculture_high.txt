THE BILL HAS ENOUGH BOTH SMALL PLACE IT ON CALL TO THE OTHER MEMBERS ARRIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MY HOLLOW [inaudible] WELL I WAS WRAPPING UP SOMETHING FOR A SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT BUT I HAVE INITIAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. AND YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT DEALING WITH CANNABIS. TRACK AND TRACE AND THE COURT SYSTEM YES INDEED. PLEASE GO AHEAD AND PROCEED. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. TO BE HERE. I AM INDEED HERE TO PRESENT AB. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT A RELATED PRESERVING ACCOUNTABLE SYSTEM FOR CANNABIS DELIVERY. IN CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES V. EFFECTIVE INTERFACE PROGRAMS -- FOOD NAG IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM FOR OR THE MOVEMENT CANNABIS. THANK CANNABIS PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. THIS ENSURES ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROTECTS AGAINST ILLICIT MARKET SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ACCOUNTABILITY TOOL. AT A MINIMUM THAT INFORMATION TO THE MUST CONTAIN THE LICENSEE RECEIVED THE PRODUCT TRANSACTION DATE. AND THE CALL TO REINFORCE PROJECT ORIGINATE PRODUCT ORIGINATE. THIS BILL OF THIS REQUIRES THE TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM TO THE SALE POINT. AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ON THE RETAIL PREMISES. OR VIA DELIVERY. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE TRACK INCREASE PROGRAM BE INTEGRATED. BUT THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS BUT YES. BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR FROM YESTERDAY -- THE RECENT MOST RECENT ROOMS ALSO C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; THE DELIVERY&lt;/c&gt;</u> INVENTORY LEDGER. WHICH ALL DELIVERY DRIVERS ARE REQUIRED TO KERRY. ALSO BE UPLOADED TO THE TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM. SO THIS WOULD PUT IN THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEM A RECORD OF WHAT IS IN THE VEHICLE. ON THIS ACTUALLY INSURERS ARE SHOULD OFFER PULLED DELIVERY DRIVER OVER. THEY CAN COMPARE THE UPWARD VERSION OF WHAT'S. SHOWN TO BE. IN THE VEHICLE WITH WHAT'S THERE. AND IS THERE IS ALWAYS A MATCH. THE DRIVERS ON HIS WAIST WAS ACTUALLY SUPERVISING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. INSURERS IT ANY ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT DELIVERY DRIVER ENCOUNTER IS BRIEF [inaudible] AND IT. THEREFORE ALSO SUPPORTS THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AVOIDS ANY SORT OF UNDUE DELAY -- REQUIRED TO DELIVER INFORMATION WITH CHILDREN TRACK AND TRACE WILL HELP ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT LAW FORCING HAVE REAL TIME INFORMATION OF THE CLUB SYSTEM. AND ALLOW THEM TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ACTION ON ILLEGAL ACTIVE AND NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON LEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES ON AND OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION COULD ACTUALLY HAVE LAWFUL DELIVERY DRIVERS BEING DETAINED UNNECESSARILY FOR LONGER PERIODS UNNECESSARY. SO THAT'S THE BACKDROP FOR THIS BILL I'D BE. ANSWERING QUESTIONS REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. I SEE YOU HERE IF YOU SENATOR DALLY. TO HAVE WHEN ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TRACY STEVENS ON BEHALF OF NOR CAL CANNABIS -- WERE KIND OF A TWEENER WHO WE WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MR COLLES BILL BEFORE IT WAS AMENDED. WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR RIGHT NOW BUT WORSE CONCERNED WHETHER OR NOT THIS CAN BE HANDLED UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM BUT WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE MORNING CAITLYN IDEA WITH EASE I IN SUPPORT OF THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND THAT ALSO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH. HER ON SOME CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH DECENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES [inaudible] OKAY. AND AND THEN I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL GO AHEAD. THE RALLY SENATOR DOLLY. THANKS DURING THE SHOW FOR ANIMALS WE SPEND A LOT OF I AM IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN ON THE TEAM OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. MANAGES IN AS SOMEBODY WHO. THOSE COMMODITIES AROUND IN AND KEEPS TRACK OF TERMINATIONS IN THOSE TYPE OF THINGS I WILL BE SUPPORTING BUILT AT THE TOO GOOD BILL ON OR TO GETTING CYLON WE CAN HOPEFULLY A PICK UP ON SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE [inaudible] AROUND ILLEGALLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THIS BILL GOING TO PUBLIC SAFETY. THAT'S BECAUSE I TURN ON MY STAFF IT DID IT DID IT GO THROUGH THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. TODAY HE ALREADY RIGHT OKAY. DID YOU GO TO PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE ASSEMBLY. PROBLEM WE NOT OKAY I DO I JUST HAVE. CONCERNS ABOUT OW LAW ENFORCEMENT FEELS ABOUT THIS AND HOW. HOW IT'S INTEGRATED WITH THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND AND WHETHER IT? PERHAPS OVERWHELMS THE CLIENT SYSTEM OR IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY WANTING THAT THEY BELIEVE WILL. STREAMLINE AND HELP I I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH HOW THIS WOULD. WOULD WORK IN A PRACTICAL MATTER COULD YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES ET STARTED TO WHERE YOU'RE SAYING THAT A DELIVERY TRUCK. PERHAPS GETS STOPPED AND IF THE LOAD MATCHES. THE LOADED SEND THE SYSTEM THAN THEY THAT PERSON CAN MOVE ON IS IT THAT EVERY TIME THERE'S A LOAD [inaudible] THAT IS. HELLO DIANA PLANS DELIVERY THEN THAT WOULD BE IN THE CLASS SYSTEM OTHERS ALREADY REQUIREMENT THAT DAY. THAT THEY HAVE THE DELIVERY LEDGER [inaudible] ARM. BUT WE HAVE IN FORCE ASSISTANT INCORPORATES OFFICERS OUT ON THE ROAD CREWS IN ABOUT. THEY CAN TRACK IT DOWN BUT BUT KNOWING WHAT'S ON THE VEHICLE DOES BECOME IMPORTANT OF POLICING ACCOUNTABILITY AS IT'S MOVING AROUND THE STATE. SO WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF A LOT. I GUESS I THINK. IT'S SORT OF A GAP IN THE IN THE SYSTEM. SAY WE WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT OUT THERE TO MAKE SURE THE DELIVERY THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS WORKING WELL -- IT SUPPORTS COMMUNITIES TO KNOW THAT WHAT. IN ON MARIJUANA TRAVéS THEIR COMMITTEE IS IS UNDER SYSTEM AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- I DON'T THINK THAT THE BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY CENTER I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE ABILITY TO ACCESS. THE DELIVERY DRIVERS OF LEDGER SO THEY CAN MATCH UP IF THEY HAVE A STOP. WE'VE NOT HEARD THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM NATIONAL FUNDING OF PATIENTS. OUT THERE AVAILABLE -- THERE'S A YEAR TO IMPLEMENT. A YEAH I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT OBJECTING TO IT. AND I THINK THE COMPELLING IDEA IS IT JUST SUPPORTS. LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THEY HAVE A STOPPING ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THIS IS. THE LOTUS REPRESENTATIVES BEING OUT THERE ON THE STREET AND THEY'RE OFTEN ON YOUR WAY. BUT ACTUALLY SUPPORTS THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. FROM DOWN TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. DO YOU HAVE WHAT YOU SHOULD. AB WHAT YOU'VE REPRESENTATIVES. THE OBLIGATION TO HAVE A DELIVER LEDGER IS ALREADY ON THE CASE. SO WHAT'S IT THAT'S NOT NEW IT'S JUST SUPPORTING THE BILL OF LONG FORCE ACCESS. I GUESS I DON'T HAVE A HE KEREN SO THE NAP BUT WE WE WE'VE NOT HEARD ANY PROBLEM [inaudible] AND AS THE CENTER LOSE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE MARIJUANA DISCUSSION SINCE FIFTEEN SINCE YOU TO DO REGIONAL. TO BILL HE YEAH I HAD I HAVEN'T HEARD OF OBJECTION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I APPRECIATE YOU BEING AHEAD OF OF THIS SAND BEFORE BECOMES A PROBLEM AND AND SUGGESTING THIS PROPOSAL. I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW IT WOULD WORK IN A WITHIN THE SYSTEM I KNOW FOR MYSELF. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH MISSING PERSONS CASES AND HAVE HAVE DONE SOME LEGISLATION DEALING WITH BACK AND I KNOW THAT WHEN SOMEONE GOES MISSING IT GOES INTO -- A SYSTEM AND THEN IT IS ALSO TRANSMITTED TO THE CLASS SYSTEM WHEN WHEN THERE'S A HIT ON SEPT. OR LEAD ON SOMEBODY THAT MAY. BE MISSING WHO POTENTIALLY IS FOUND THAT'S AUTOMATICALLY SUBMITTED TO THE CLASS. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH -- OLDER MISSING PERSONS CASES FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THEY WERE NOT PUT INTO THE SYSTEM AT ALL -- AND SO THERE'S SAID. A GAP N.. OLDER CASES. NOT BEING IN THE SYSTEMAND NEWER CASES BEING IN THE SYSTEM AND ALSO. THERE WERE [inaudible] REQUIREMENTS THAT. REQUIRED IN CERTAIN CASES AND NOT IN OTHERS AND SO FORTH SO IT'S NOT A 1100% GUARANTEED SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN RELY ON SOMEBODY WHO'S MISSING BEING IN THAT SYSTEM. SO WITH THOSE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IT MAKES ME WONDER -- IS THIS. TRULY THE PLACE BUT WE SHOULD BE TRACKING THIS KIND OF THING AND I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH. ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY END OF OF WEATHER. THAT ACTUALLY IS WORKABLE AND DO A FULLER WITH CREATING ANOTHER SET OF PROBLEMS WELL. I GUESS THE OVERALL THE RESPONSE I HAVE. YOU KNOW I OFTEN. IT'S FUNNY IS A LAWYER WHEN I SIT DOWN AND DRAFT A BILL. I DO MY BUILD DRAFT AND I HANDED TO PEOPLE LOOK AT BECAUSE IN OUR BUSINESS BILLS GALLON HAVE TO BE BACK. IN MY VIEW IS ALWAYS BEEN WELL. I'LL TAKE MY DRAFT. AND I LIKE THE WAY I'M DOING IT WRONG -- THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT NOT AT ALL. SOME IS GONNA TAKE A WHACK AT IT GOT TO PUT AN IDEA OUT THERE I THINK. WE DEFINITELY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE LEAGUE. MARKET PLACE. LEGAL MARKET PLACE. IS THE CONCURRENT EXISTENCE OF AN ILLEGAL MARK [inaudible] AND WE THE GREAT VENTURE OF TRYING TO BRING RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA TO THE MASSES IN CALIFORNIA. IS VERY DEPENDENT UPON HAVING THE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT LEGAL. AND SORT OF STAMPED DOWN ON ILLEGAL. AND THE SYSTEM RELIES UPON THE MOVEMENT OF MARIJUANA AROUND TO VENDORS OTHER [inaudible] CHANNELS [inaudible] SO. THAT MOVEMENT AND MAKING SURE IT IS OF THE LEGAL PRODUCT. IS ACTUALLY ESSENTIAL TO CALIFORNIA TRANSITIONING TO A HEALTHY MARKET PLACE. IT TIES INTO TAX REVENUES. AND NOT HAVING LEAKAGE -- ILLEGAL. THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF PUBLIC INTEREST THE CONVERGES UPON. THE MOVIE TO MARIJUANA TO THE SYSTEM. AND SUPPORTING [inaudible] RELIGION OPERATORS. AND DOWN ON THE ILLEGAL. SO I FEEL LIKE. PUT IN A TOOL. IN THE TOOL KIT. WHICH IS THE ESPECIAL THIS BILL. ALONG OR SEND REAL TIME. THEY STOPPED THE VEHICLE TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL LOOK UP TO SEE WHAT TO EXPECT TO FIND IN THIS VEHICLE. WHAT DO I SEE HERE? WHAT DELIVERS HAVE ALREADY MADE OKAY THAT MEANS WE'RE NOW DOWN OF THESE ITEMS AND ARE THEY HERE? AS RUNNING ELSE. IT WILL ALLOW FOR TRAFFIC STOPS TO BE SEATED MORE PATIENT MANNER. AND ANYBODY WHO'S IN BUSINESS AS A DELIVERY DRIVERS NEVER COME IS OUR THEY DON'T WANT TO SPEND TIME. AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. YOU KNOW. WHILE PEOPLE KIND OF GO BACK AND FORTH ON THE SYSTEM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT [inaudible] SO. IT IS IN PRINT HAS BEEN IN PRINT NOW FOR A WHILE I WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR FROM LONG OR SENATE'S. IT'S IT'S LOOKING TO A DATE A YEAR ROUND WHEN THE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE UP AND RUNNING. I THINK ULTIMATELY IT UP HOLDS THE PUBLIC VALUES OF REGULATED MEDICAL. REGULATE MARIJUANA IN THE MARKETPLACE [inaudible] THAT IS. PASSES TO COMMUNITIES IS ACCORDING TO PRESCRIBE NORTH STATE SET UP. SOMEONE DOESN'T CARE FOR MARIJUANA. WE STILL FEEL THAT THEIR LIFE IS NOT. UNDULY IMPACTED. SO IT'S SORT OF A POLICY RATIONALE [inaudible] I I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERIENCE VIEW POINT. THAT THERE CAN BE A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES SYSTEMS AND MY SORT OF CROSSING MY FINGERS AND WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD IS I BRING THIS IDEA OF BOARD SAYING [inaudible] GREAT IDEA. I APPRECIATE THAT I'M. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE A MOTION ON THE BILL TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MEETING WITH YOU AND SOME INDIVIDUALS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT JUST TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND AND SEE AND SEE IF. IF WHAT YOU'RE ENVISIONING AND WELL -- WE MAY APPROVED TODAY. IS WORKABLE OR IF IT NEEDS -- SOME ADDITIONAL EYES AND ATTENTION TO IT SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE GOOD PBLIC POLICY. AND A VERY NEW AREA I'VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED WORKING WITH YOU IN THE PAST AND JUST WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING IT RIGHT. AND I DON'T KNOW A KNIFE ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. AND TO TO HAVE A SENSE OF OF WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING. IS ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK IN PRACTICE SO.
