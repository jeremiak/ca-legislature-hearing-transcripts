WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE ESPECIALLY MY COLLEAGUES IN REMEMBER BONTA WHO I'LL TURN OVER TO AND A FEW MINUTES I'M AND ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO ARE JOINING US REMOTELY ALL OF OUR PANELISTS WILL BE. REMOTELY PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING A FEW LOGISTICAL NOTES BEFORE WE BEGIN ANYONE WHO'S HERE IN THE MEETING ROOM IS REQUIRED TO WEAR A MASK AT ALL TIMES AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCE ALL TESTIMONY TODAY WILL BE DELIVERED REMOTELY AND THERE WILL BE TIME FOR. PUBLIC COMMENT WHICH WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE THIRD PANEL. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MAKE A NOTE OF THE USE OF GENDERED LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT THE HEARING. WE WILL BE DISCUSSING REPRODUCTIVE CARE AND SCREENINGS PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THESE ISSUES DO NOT AFFECT ALL WOMEN NOR DO THEY AFFECT SOLELY WOMEN. TRANS WOMEN TRANS MEN AND NON BINARY PEOPLE ARE ALL AFFECTED IN VARIOUS WAYS. BY THE BIRTHING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND ARE OFTEN MARGINALIZED WITHIN IT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CONFORM TO THE GENDER NORMS THAT THE SYSTEM A POLLS. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS. AND THESE ISSUES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS CISGENDER WOMEN WITH UTERUS IS. THAT THEY ARE BY NO MEANS EXCLUSIVE TO THIS GROUP WE WILL USE BOTH GENDER EXPANSIVE AND GENDERED LANGUAGE IN THIS HEARING. TO REFLECT THE EXPERIENCES OF OUR PANELISTS AND HIGHLIGHT ISSUES THAT PRIMARILY AFFECT WOMEN. WELL RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE HEARING TO ORDER. WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED THREE YEARS AGO ONE OF MY FIRST ACCIDENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS REQUEST THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PRESIDENT AND WE'RE SEEING THE EXTREMIST CONSERVATISM ASCENT WE KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO BE PREPARED FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS TO BE THREATENS. YESTERDAY WE HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS TO DECIDE THE FUTURE OF ABORTION RIGHTS IN AMERICA. WITH ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE CARE UNDER THREAT IN OVER HALF THE STATE'S. IT IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT THIS COMMITTEE CONTINUE TO OPERATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO BE A BEACON FOR HOPE FOR ALL AMERICAN WOMEN BUT ALSO THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE TO EVERY WOMAN IT NEEDS THAT. REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE ISSUE BY MANY FACTORS LEGAL SOCIAL ECONOMIC PHYSICAL AND THIS COMMITTEE IS HERE TO EXAMINE THESE ISSUES AND SUPPORT THOSE SEEKING CARE IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. TODAY WILL BE FOCUSED ON CODE RED AND THE BARRIERS IT HAS AFFECTED AND EXACERBATED WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE SET OF PANELISTS GATHERED TOGETHER HERE WITH US TODAY VIRTUALLY. A RANGE OF CARE GIVERS ADVOCATES AND EXPERTS ON THE MANY ISSUES THAT HAVE IMPACTED REPRODUCTIVE MATERNAL AND MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE COBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC ISSUED TWO NEW REALITY IN EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BUT THE NEED FOR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE AND HEALTH CARE NEVER STOPPED. BABIES CONTINUE TO BE BORN. CONTINUE TO NEED BIRTH CONTROL WE ALL CONTINUED TO NEED TO GO TO THE DOCTOR AND GET OUR SCREENINGS. THE PANDEMIC HOWEVER THREW UP INNUMERABLE OBSTACLES TO THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL BEING OF EVERYONE AND PARTICULARLY WOMEN ASIAN BLACK INDIGENOUS AND THE TEENAGE PEOPLE. PREGNANT AND PREGNANT PEOPLE GENERALLY. WITH ALL ATTENTION FOCUSED ON KOBE CARE REPRODUCTIVE AND MATERNAL HEALTH OFTEN BECAME AN AFTERTHOUGHT NEGLECTING THIS CARE WILL HAVE SERIOUS LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THAT TODAY. THE PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN US MORE THAN EVER THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE GOES FAR BEYOND THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ABORTION. WE'RE CHOOSING TO USE THIS HEARING TO FOCUS ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN THE BROADEST SENSE THIS SOCIAL MEDICAL AND MENTAL DETERMINANTS OF HUMAN WELL BEING THAT IMPRINT AT IMPACT REPRODUCTIVE REALITY. THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT HAS BEEN BRUTALLY UNEQAL. FROM JOB LOSSES TO CODE RATES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED WITH WOMEN BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE CHILD CARE. HEALTH CARE AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC KOBE JOB LOSSES WERE IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRIES THE MAJORITY OF WHOSE EMPLOYEES WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR LATINO AND BLACK WOMEN SKYROCKET OVER TWENTY TWO PERCENT. THREE TIMES THE RATE OF WHITE MEN. WOMEN WERE LESS LIKELY TO RETURN TO WORK WHEN CHILDREN ERE STILL OUT OF SCHOOL WITH MANY DROPPING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE ENTIRELY. THESE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OUR HEALTH IMPACTS THE STRESS OF THE FINANCIAL STRAIN FOOD HOUSING MEDICAL AND SECURITY HAS BEEN LINKED TO SERIOUS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL IMPACTS. REACHING FROM DEPRESSION TO HEART DISEASE INCREASED STRESS AND ISOLATION IS LINKED TO INCREASES IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FACE PARTICULAR BARRIERS TO THE PANDEMIC. THE EPIDEMIC WHICH PARTICULARLY IMPACTS WOMEN HAS BEEN BRUTAL WEDNESDAY AT HOME ORDERS AFFECT THOSE WHOSE HOMES ARE NOT SAFE. WE WILL DISCUSS THOSE IMPACTS THE BARRIERS AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THEM AND OUR THIRD PANEL. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND COMPREHENSIVE ACCESS. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE VOLUNTARILY DELAYED THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC TO GOING BACK AND GETTING BIRTH CONTROL PILLS SURGERY. AND THE CARE THEY NEED. WE KNOW THE MEDIC KALORAMA HAS SKYROCKET DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH ONE AND A HALF MILLION MORE PEOPLE NOW RECEIVING BENEFITS THAN IN TWENTY NINETEEN. A TOTAL OF A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. MEDIC HOUSE A LANDMARK PROGRAM BUT THE ENROLLMENT WITHOUT CORRESPONDING INCREASES IN STAFF IS STRANGE BACKLOG THE HOSPITALS THAT TAKE MEDICARE OUT AND WE'LL HEAR FROM SOME OF THOSE PROVIDERS TODAY. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS THE MOST BASIC AND ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE. BUT IT IS OFTEN SEEN AS EXTRANEOUS UNNECESSARY OR A LUXURY. WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IN GENDER AFFIRMING CARE WERE OVERLOOKED IN UNDER RESOURCE ALREADY. BUT THE PANDEMIC RESOURCE CRUNCHES HAVE JUST EXACERBATED THE INEQUALITIES. WE'RE HERE TO EXAMINE HOW THE POLICIES PLAY OUT IN THE FUTURE WHAT IS NEEDED AS WE LOOK FORWARD. AND WE'LL EXAMINE THREE AREAS OF WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC DELAYED CARE BIRTHING HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THIS CONVERSATION IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEING HAD IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC CAN BE HARD TO FOCUS ON ANYTHING BUT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AS IT RELATES TO THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER WE MUST NOT IGNORE THE IMPACTS ON THE DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FOR WOMEN AND BIRTHING PEOPLE AND BABIES WHO ARE JOINING OUR WORLD THE FORM THE BEDROCK OF OUR FUTURE. IN FACT WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO UP WITH THESE ISSUES WE WANT UNDERSTAND THEM WE WANT TO PRIORITIZE THEM AND WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AS A LEGISLATURE TO RESOLVE THEM. SO TODAY WE WILL TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WE'LL DO OUR BEST BUT IT WILL ONLY BEGINNING OF THIS CONVERSATION. SO I AM EXCITED TO START THE CONVERSATION AND I HOPE TO FIND SOME ANSWERS IN THE HOURS AHEAD. SO LET'S GET THIS STARTED BUT FIRST BEFORE WE DO I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA FOR HER OPENING REMARKS.

THE NECESSITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO ESSENTIALLY BE IN MANY WAYS AT THE STATE AND THE LAST STAND FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. IN THIS COUNTRY- IS INCREDIBLY POIGNANT IN THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW AS WE FACE DOWN THE PANDEMIC. TO RECOGNIZE THE WAYS IN WHICH OUR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH FOR WOMEN AND BIRTHING PEOPLE CONTINUES TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO STRIVE FOR. AND I AM SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING TOGETHER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO EXPLORE WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE. THAT WE CAN HAVE THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC MEDICATED.

IN OUR COMMUNITIES- ARE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE. FOR WOMEN IN BIRTHING PEOPLE CONTINUES TO BE OF GRAVE CONCERN. FOR US ALL AND I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS COMMITTEE AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE AT THESE ISSUES THE INTERSECTION ALITY AND THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACTS THAT THIS- MOMENTS OF THE PANDEMIC AT THIS MOMENT OF.

AND I DID WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN- REALLY CHALLENGING FOR A PARTICULAR STOCK STARTED PATIENTS ARE PRIMARILY OUR MEDICAL PATIENTS OF WHICH ABOUT MEDICAL PATIENTS AND- THEIR MAJOR TEND TO BE EITHER- UNINSURED OR JUST KIND OF. A SMATTERING OF OTHER PUBLIC INSURANCE SAYS- AND WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS. IN CARE THAT OUR PATIENTS ARE EXPERIENCING- JUST FROM THE SHEER VOLUME OF. OUR OUR PATIENTS HAVE SORT OF SORT OF OVERWHELMED BECAUSE- ANYWAY. I'M SORRY SOMETHING THAT WE I THINK I GOING TO BE JUST L. BUT I MEAN I DO FIND THAT MUST REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ADDED. I HAVE HAD SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF. SEEKING CARE AND BEING ABLE TO- TO- HAVE APPROPRIATE CARE FOR- YOU KNOW WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUES. THANK YOU THANK YOU DR CITIES THAT I'M DOCTOR ALYSIA INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

OKAY LOOK AT THAT MY CHILDREN WOULD BE SO PROUD OF ME OKAY SO- GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN I'M BACK TO BEING ALEISHA I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED OBGYN WHO NOW SERVES AS THE SENIOR MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH AND- ADVANCED DIAGNOSTICS THE QUEST- IN INTERESTING PLACE EXHORTATION IMPRESSED WITH IT TO BE RIGHT NOW AFTER HAVING HAD A LONG CAREER IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND NOW MOVES OVER THE- DIAGNOSTIC SIDE IS THAT WE- TAKE CARE. ABOUT YOUR 50% OF THE POSITION LAP LABORATORIES- IN THE UNITED STATES NOW WE PROVIDE ALL THOSE TESTS AND ALSO ABOUT ONE IN THREE ADULT AMERICANS COME THROUGH OUR LABS EVERY EVERY YEAR- SO IN THIS INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION WITH AN INCREDIBLE FOOTPRINT INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT TO WOMEN'S HEALTH AND I WANNA MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR AND ALSO. TO INEQUITIES IN HEALTH- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WITH ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY PATIENTS CENTERS. AND OUR FOCUS IS REALLY ON PREVENTIVE CARE EARLY DIAGNOSIS MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC CARE AND BEING YOU KNOW AS IT REALLY PARTNERS WITH YOU OUR HEALTH SYSTEM COLLEAGUES AND OUR- COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE STATES AND REALLY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. WHAT I'M GOING TO BE FOCUSING AYE ABOUT SEVEN SLIDES HERE AND I REALIZE I HAVE FIVE MINUTES ALL RUSHED THROUGH AS MUCH AS I CAN I WILL I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT CHLAMYDIA GONORRHEA PRACTICAL GONORRHEA I AM THE FOCUS PRIMARILY ON CHLAMYDIA. AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE SEE ALL THE TIME- I SEE THAT SHE IS SMILING BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR SHE'S PROBABLY JUST HAD OUR BOARDS BECAUSE I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE NOT LONG OUT OF YOUR RESIDENCY. BUT THIS IS WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TALK ABOUT CHLAMYDIA- THIS IS NOT AN ABSTRACTION YOU SEE THIS ALL THE TIME THE WOMAN HAS UP A PILLOW SHE'S HOLDING APOLLO BECAUSE SHE'S IN PAIN AND THE REASON SHE'S IN PAIN IS BECAUSE SHE HAS OCCASIONS SHE HAS IN FACT INFORMATION OR PELVISTHAT'S CAUSED BY SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION. THAT EITHER WAS ON DIAGNOSED YOU KNOW DIAGNOSE TO NOT TREATED CORRECTLY SHE DIDN'T HAVE FOLLOW UP IN THIS LEADS TO INFERTILITY. CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN X. BUT PREGNANCY SOME. PRETERM BIRTH IN MAY WE'RE TALK ABOUT THE PRIME DAY. URETHRITIS INHABITED. NOW OKAY GREAT CHAU ME THE DATA- THE IS WHAT IT FOCUS ON THE STATE OF. BUT I'M GONNA FOR IT IN A LARGER. FOR MAY. LIMITING GUN. THE NEW JUST KEEP GOING UP THIS IS TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE- NINETEEN AND MAY GIVE YOU SOME FACTS ON THIS INTERESTING THAT IT'S FLIPPED. IN BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN STARTING AROUND TWENTY THIRTEEN. NOW LISTS THIS IS THE THAT THE FACT SHEET IF YOU WELL SOMEBODY A FAX ABOUT TWO MILLION. CASES OF CHLAMYDIA WERE REPORTED IS REPORTABLE DISEASE. THE CDC IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWO MILLION CASES. OVERALL RATE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THE HIGHEST RATES AND THIS IS WHAT BREAKS YOUR HEART. AS WELL ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS. A TWO THIRDS 61% WERE AMONG PERSONS AGED FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. AND SO YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL RATE UP HERE AT FIVE FIFTY TWO YOU LOOK AT THE ADOLESCENT RIGHT EXCUSE ME. FOR BASICALLY FOUR THOUSAND PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT YOU SAY WHERE DOES CALIFORNIA SAID BUT THAT. CALIFORNIA IS RANKED NUMBER FIFTEEN. IN THE COUNTRY- YOUR CASE RATE THIS IS ROB FIVE NINETY EIGHT OR SIX HUNDRED SLIGHTLY ABOVE THIS CASE RIGHT. WHICH IS ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND ROUND NUMBERS AND- AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE THIS IN A MINUTE YOU'RE KIND OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT THIS IS HAVING ON DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES SO. DOES THE COMPANY OR FAX TWO MILLION. AND IMPACTING YOU KNOW THAT ONE OUT OF THE ADOLESCENTS AND THIS IS THE SIDE THAT I. REALLY WANT YOU TO. IN BED IN YOUR MAY. IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS THE THANK FOR A- AND EUROPE AND THE- FIFTEEN. AND ACTUALLY. YOU SEE THE YOU KNOW THREE THE- FIFTEEN AND I- YOU KNOW FOR THE IS WHAT'S CAUSING THE PAIN THE INFERTILITY THE PRETERM BIRTH. AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. NOW I CAN GO OVER CHLAMYDIA IT'S ABOUT A QUARTER OF WHAT YOU SEE WITH- GOT. A STUDENT WITH A LOT OF FOCUS ON GONORRHEA SPETTACOLO WHAT YOU SEE WITH CHLAMYDIA. YOU CA 92% INCREASE MOSTLY AMONG MEN- AND THEN THIS IS THE- THE GIRLS ARE GONNA REYES FACTS BUT I A FULL. YOUR BACK TO THIS ONE. AND I KNOW THIS IS A YEAR I DON'T SAY THIS IS BUSY BECAUSE OF MY PROFESSORS IN MED SCHOOL SAID THAT. YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW I JUST GO TO SLEEP WAS BUSY OF ME IS NOT IMPORTANT I WANT TO BREAK THIS DOWN FOR YOU SIR AT THE BOTTOM WHAT YOU SEE. THE AND PANDEMIC AFFECTING Q. ONE Q. TWO Q. THREE Q. FOUR THE BLUE BARS IN THE BACK. OUR WHAT WE SAW DURING A NORMAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN AND YOU ALWAYS SEE A FALL OFFERED TESTING VOLUMES AS WE HAVE OVER HERE. AROUND THANKSGIVING AND AROUND THE HOLIDAY TIME. BUT WHAT WE SEE YOU KNOW AGAIN WHEN THE PANDEMIC COMES AROUND. IS THAT IT JUST CREATORS AND PEOPLE THESE ARE TEST PINES WE STOP GETTING WOMEN TESTED WOMEN STOP COULDN'T GO TO CLINICS. THE CLINICS WERE SHUT DOWN WE WERE DOING TESTING FOR CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA SO AND INTERESTINGLY YOU SEE AN INCREASE HERE IN THE OVERALL RATE I THINK YOU SEE THAT. ARE IN THE PERCENTAGE POSITIVITY BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE WOMEN WHO HAD IT NEEDED TO GO GET TESTED. SO WE'RE MISSING ALL OF THESE WOMEN THIS IS THE IMPACT THESE ARE THESE WOMEN HAVE BEEN LOST TO CARE. AND LAW AND SO THE LOS SECURE LOS TO FOLLOW UP AND THEY'RE GONNA END UP POSSIBLY WITH THAT MOLDERING INFECTION SO OF THE TEST VOLUME NUMBERS. WE ALWAYS SIT AROUND BASICALLY THREE AFTER 4% POSITIVITY- BUT IF WE'RE NOT TESTING THE PEOPLE WERE NOT SEEN THEM AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHOWING UP. IN THE WITH THE WITH THE PROBLEMS- COMMENSURATE WITH UNDIAGNOSED CHLAMYDIA INFECTION- THE SAME THING YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT WITH GONORRHEA THEY THEY REALLY MATCH EACH OTHER YOU SEE THE PANDEMIC A FACT- I DON'T REALLY WANT IT YOU KNOW YOU SEE AN UPTICK IN- IN GONORRHEA WHICH IS ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING- AND THAT'S- YOUR WORK. I THINK THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW FROM THE MSM POPULATION. IN ANY EVENT WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE AND I WANT TO GO BACK IS. UNDIAGNOSED UNTREATED YOU KNOW AND THESE PEOPLE ARE MESSED. M. LAST NIGHT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. IS THE IMPACT THIS IS THE- SLIDE. THE WHITE AREA. DOWN HERE I'M I'M NOT FROM WITH THE STATE OF. I MEAN HE'S CO PERSON SO I PUT THE STATE OF. MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO. DON'T KNOW WHERE CAL. IS BUT USE. WHAT WE UP HERE IS YOU SEE THE LARGEST DIG. IN THESE Y. AREAS. OVER HERE IN THE LARGEST AREAS. AND I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT THESE ARE THE AREAS THAT ARE MOST IN NEED. THAT ARE MOST UNDERSERVED THAT HAVE THE POOREST ACCESS TO CARE. AND IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THIS COLLECTIVELY WE'RE GONNA BE. DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE. DOWNLINE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY- YOU'RE GONNA BE HURTING WOMEN REALLY HURTING LIMON YOU'RE GONNA BE HURTING BABIES. SO MY CLOSING POINTS ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS ARE RISING. THEY CONTINUE TO RISE. IF LEFT UNDIAGNOSED THESE STI SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. IF UNDIAGNOSED AND UNTREATED IMPACT THE LIVES OF BABIES- MATURITY ADOLESCENTS. INFERTILITY AND ADULTS PUBLIC PAIN INFERTILITY ECTOPIC. PREGNANCY THE CODEPENDENT. RESULTED IN THE DECREASE BE CREATIVE MATTEL. J. THIS. EXIST WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT HAD ON. WE AS HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HEALTHCARE POLICY MAKERS. SHARE THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES HEAD ON AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT WE'RE ALSO IS BLESSED ORGANIZATION WE'RE COMMITTED TO HELPING THIS AND ANYTHING THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN DO OR I CAN DO. TO HELP YOU ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ADDRESS THIS ISSUE YOU JUST CALL ME I'M THERE SO THAT'S MY SHORT PRESENTATION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR- THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS AND- THAT'S ALL I HAVE I'M GONNA LET YOU WILL TAKE THE TAKE THE BALL BACK IN AND TAKE I OVER. THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU DR LEISHA THAT WE WILL NOT SHOULD OVER TO ROSA FRAME FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD MAR MONTE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT SHE'S SEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. Q. MY NAME IS ROSE FREIGHT AND- FAMILY NURSE. OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD MAR MONTE. I WORKED WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. AND MOST RECENTLY JOINED OUR MEDICAL MANAGEMENT TEAM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS DIRECTOR OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND NURSING. DURING THE PANDEMIC LIKE MANY OF US AS COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MY QUALITY MANAGEMENT PARTY'S QUICKLY SHIFTED FROM AGENDA ITEMS LIKE ROUTINE HEALTH SERVICES- INSURING FOR MEETING INTERNAL QUALITY METRICS- SET FORTH. INTERNALLY AND THROUGH BY THE COUNTY STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS. THIS QUICKLY SHIFTED TO KEEPING OUR STAFF AND PATIENT SAFETY IN THE MIDST OF PANDEMIC AND OUR DOORS OPEN TO CONTINUE CLINICAL SERVICES BUT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT NEEDED US. AT MY MUNCIE LAUNCHED INTO ACTION TO PROVIDE VERY QUICKLY COBIT NINETEEN TESTING WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS WE ARE IN. I DID STAFF COULD NINETEEN. THIS INCLUDED DRIVING THROUGH OUR AFFILIATE IF AND YOU AREN'T AWARE OF SOME OF YOUR TO WHERE WE EXPAND FROM AT MY MUNCIE SPANS A VAST REGION OVER BASS REGION FROM RENO NEVADA ALL THE WAY DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD. SO THAT WE WERE SUCCESSFULLY. WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDED ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND COBIT NINETEEN TESTS OVER THREE HUNDRED VACCINES TO STAFF AND MOST RECENTLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED POSTERS. I'M PROUD TO BE A PART OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNER SOMEONE CONSIDER EVEN A LEADER IN PROVIDING HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION IN BY EXPANDING RIGHTS AND ACCESS FOR COMMUNITIES. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SHARING MORE OF HOW THE KOBE NINETEEN IMPACT HAS AND CONTINUES TO DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR PATIENTS AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO MEET THEIR NEEDS SO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN YOUR HOUSE. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THOSE INTRODUCTIONS I GUESS I WOULD START BY ASKING- BOTH ABBAS FRAY AND DOCTORS CITYJET. AND WHAT INCREASE NEEDS HAVE YOU SEEN DURING KOBE- ARE THERE. WHAT ARE WE SEEING WITH PREGNANT PEOPLE PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS WHAT HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF WHAT PATIENTS ARE APPEARING IN YOUR CLINICS WITH. THAT RESEARCHERS ARE YOU WANNA TAKE THAT FIRST. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I PERSONALLY FOUND IN MY PRACTICES THAT AND BECAUSE OF THE- THERE'S BEEN ACTUALLY THE STATE HOME ORDERS AND YOU KNOW KIND OF AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE WERE VERY CAUTIOUS IN TERMS OF. HAVING PATIENTS PHYSICALLY PRESENT TO OUR CLINICS FOR CARE- AND WE DID FIND THAT A LOT OF- I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO. DELAY SEEKING CARE FOR THEIR PREGNANCIES SO- LATE ENTRY TO CARE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN AND ARE PREGNANT AND READING POPULATION- BECAUSE PEOPLE WAITING. TO SEE CARE UNTIL LATER ON IN THEIR PREGNANCY- THERE IS- YOUR HUSBAND A TREND TOWARDS. IN THE HIGHER ACUITY A PREGNANCY AT TIME OF PRESENTATION. BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS- A PREGNANT PERSON WELL AS A PRE EXISTING CONDITION LIKE DIABETES OR HYPERTENSION HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE- I FOR EXAMPLE HAD A PATIENT WHO IS A PRETTY- BRITTLE DIABETIC SHE HAS VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL BLOOD SUGARS. AND BECAUSE. SHE BECAME PREGNANT SHE THOUGHT. I'M THAT ALL OF DIABETES NOT ARE GOING TO BE SAFE AND- SO SHE'S. TAKING ALL OF THEM AND DUE TO THE- AND THEN DIDN'T PRESENT TO CARE BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID- ABOUT- BEING EXPOSED TO COALBED DIDN'T STEEP KAREN TOLD. WELL AFTER- SO PROBABLY ACCEPT TWENTY SOMETHING WEEKS- I'VE JUST STATION. SO FOR HER BY THE TIME SHE GOT TO US WE HAD TO SEND HER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CONTROL HER BLOOD SUGARS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO. WILDLY OUT OF CONTROL- AND SO OBVIOUSLY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT IMPACT NOT ONLY HER AND HER FUTURE HEALTH BUT ALSO THE HEALTH OF HER AND HER BABY. WHO ALLEN IT'S PAST% THE POINT WHERE ALL OF ITS ORGANS ARE DEVELOPING- AND WE DO KNOW THAT I'M CONTROL DIABETES AS IMPACTS IN TERMS OF- IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN- DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART SO BABIES CAN HAVE. ANOMALIES DUE TO UNCONTROLLED DIABETES SO A LOT OF A LOT OF ISSUES LIKE THAT ARE COMING UP WHERE WHERE ON PATIENTS ARE DECIDING NOT TO PRESENT UNTIL QUITE LATE- AND- ITS RESULTING. PRETTY MAJOR COMPANY. NC'S THANK YOU FOR THAT- THIS RADIO AT ANYTHING TO IT YOU'RE SEEING A PLAN PARA MOMENTOUS. SO ONE OF THE FEW SILVER LINING AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS CAUSED BY COULD BE NINETEEN WAS THE ACCELERATION OF OUR TELEHEALTH SERVICES ACROSS ALL OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS. AT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WITH TRANSITION AND GET UP AND RUNNING AND ABOUT THREE WEEKS SHIFTING YOU KNOW FROM IN PERSON TO TELEHEALTH WAS INITIALLY CHALLENGING BUT MOST OF OUR PATIENTS RECENTLY HEARD PRIME. AND APPRECIATED THIS OPTION AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT BECAUSE IT WAS SAFE AND IT WAS CONVENIENT. THIS YOU KNOW OPEN ACCESS TO THOSE PATIENTS WHO WERE NOW HOME WITH THEIR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN IN DISTANCE LEARNING AND THIS OPEN ACCESS TO THOSE PATIENTS WHOSE STILL HAD TO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY AND NEEDED TO DO THESE VISITS ON THEIR LUNCH BREAKS. AND IT'S JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW MANY YOU KNOW RELIED ON THESE TELEHEALTH VISITS DURING THE PANDEMIC 4260% OF OUR VISITS WERE COMPLETED USING TELEHEALTH SERVICES. AND. WEEK QUICK EIGHT. FOUND OUT THAT MANY OF OUR VISITS BE TELEPATHIC FAMILY MEDICINE. JENNER FOR MAKING AND HARMAN THERAPY. PRACTICE ITS INFECTION SCREENINGS PRESCRIPTION BASED BIRTH CONTROL EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION. WE WERE AND- ALSO TO LEVERAGE TELEHEALTH FOR EVEN TRIAGING PATIENTS TO SEE IF THEY ACTUALLY NEED TO COME INTO THE HEALTH CENTER SO. BECAUSE OF THIS WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN AND SERVICES GOING. AND WE ALSO LOOKED AT CURBSIDE PICKUPS FOR BIRTH CONTROL AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS AN OPTION BELIEVE WE LAUNCHED PRETTY QUICKLY- OUR FAMILY MEDICINE SITES USE POINT OF CARE TESTING. AND COPING NINETEEN TEST COLLECTION VIA CURBSIDE AND FORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF A DELAY IN OUR SERVICES WERE AND ARE PUSHING CARE SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC. OBTAINING PREGNANCY OPTIONS IN COUNSELING IS CONSIDERED. TIME SENSITIVE SERVICE AND WITH THIS WE KNEW WE HAD TO ACT QUICKLY TO MEET OUR PATIENTS ABORTION CARE NEEDS AND ENABLING OUR CLINICIANS REFER TO BURKE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE. AND WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THESE VISITS MORE EFFICIENT AND EASIER FOR OUR PATIENTS TO ACCESS TELEHEALTH IS BEEN. ESSENTIAL TO KEEP IS GOING. THANK YOU ALL TURN OVER TEMAS BONTA FOR. THANK YOU I A QUESTION DIRECTED I THINK- PRIMARILY TO MISS FREY- EIGHT CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE IF YOU WERE TAKEN PROJECT THE NEEDS THAT YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO CARE MOVING FORWARD COVERT WE'RE NOT DONE WITH CO VIDEO AT- AND- AND SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASED ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO USE METHODS LIKE TELEHEALTH AS- A MEANS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT BUT IT JUST TO GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT ELSE WE NEED. MOVING FORWARD FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. YES SO AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR TELEHEALTH BY VIDEO AND PHONE VISITS WITH APPROPRIATE REIMBURSEMENT RATES IS. ESSENTIAL TO CONTINUE OUR SERVICES. WE FOUND THAT WE NEEDED TO INCREASE AT WE FOUND THAT WE HAD AN INCREASE IN NEED FOR TELEHEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS AT THIS TIME LACK OF STATE FUNDING FOR THIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF SERVICE- SYPHILIS SCREENING IS. CRITICAL TO THE FIGHT IF THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE SIDE OF THE FIGHT FOR THAT SIPPLE'S EPIDEMIC- AND WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO. I'D SURPLUS TESTING AND TREATMENT- I'M FUNDING INNOVATION IDEAS AT LARGE BY IN PLACES LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD MAR MONTE IS. IS ESSENTIALLY THE ANSWER TO AND MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IN GENERAL FUNDING THAT FOCUSES ON IMPORTANCE OF STI TESTING AND PILOTING TESTING METHODS THAT BETTER MEET THE PUBLIC NEEDS EXAMPLES COULD BE LIKE RAPID IN CLINIC TESTING. AT HOME TESTING TO INCLUDE PATIENTS SELF COLLECTION METHODS- AND THEN THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY WOULD BE YOU KNOW THIS THERE'S THIS DISCOURSE WITH VACCINE FUNDING OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS- WE PROVIDE SEVERAL VACCINES IN OUR HEALTH CENTERS BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT FUNDING FOR US FOR. TAXIS WHICH IS EACH PEAVEY. VACCINE AT THIS TIME AND JUST WRITE YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE INCREASE FUNDING AND LARGELY IN SETTINGS. WOULD HAVE A GREAT IMPACT. THANK YOU. I WOULD ACTUALLY ADAM LIVED HER DOCTORS WHO TASIA REFLECT ON THAT AS IT RELATES TO THE DELAYS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT- BURNING PEOPLE AND WOMEN WHO NEED OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ARE SHOWING UP- EARLIER. NO ACTUALLY I AGREE WITH MISS FREY HONEST ON TOP WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED OUR TELEHEALTH EARNED ABILITIES AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE A LOT OF FUN IT IS IT'S ACTUALLY EXPANDING OUT TO DO VIDEOCASSETTES AS WELL- AND BE ABLE TO BE APPROPRIATELY REIMBURSED FOR THOSE VISITS IS KIND OF CHALLENGING I THINK THOSE VISITS- AREN'T. AT THE WE DON'T AT IN TERMS OF OUR REIMBURSEMENT IS JUST THERE'S SEVERAL OF THOSE THAT THAT MAKE UP LIKE A SINGLE IN PERSON VISIT FOR EXAMPLE- SO I THINK HAVING SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO. INCREASED ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH MEDIC HOW IS THAT THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PROVIDERS IN THAT SYSTEM MANY PEOPLE CHOOSE MANY PHYSICIANS MANY- CLINICIANS CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE MEDIC- AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE POOR REIMBURSEMENT RATE. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT- N. AS IN THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS THEY LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO BECOME INSURANCE A STATE TRANSITION TO PUBLIC INSURANCE- AND- THE PUBLIC INSURANCE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED BY SUCH A LARGE VOLUME OF PEOPLE AND NOT ENOUGH. PROVIDERS TO PRIME BY CARE FOR THOSE PEOPLE- SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE SORT OF THIS LIKE. DOUBT YOU KNOW TRICKLE A FACT WHERE NOW WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS BECAUSE NO PROVIDERS AREN'T BEING REIMBURSED APPROPRIATELY FOR THE KIND OF CARE- AND THEN WE HAVE JUST THIS HUGE SORT OF BACKLOG OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. UNABLE TO GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED WITHIN A TIMELY MANNER. AND SO IT JUST TO STIR BACK THAT INCREASE OUR REMEMBER RATES FOR VERY AT FOR THE THAT MAKE IT. AT CARE MORE ACCESSIBLE WOULD BE GREAT. YEAH I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE AND ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF TELEHEALTH IS THAT WHERE WE HAVE- DESERT'S OF MEDI CAL PROVIDERS OR PROVIDERS GENERALLY W CAN PROVIDE. CARE AT A. DISTANCE WHICH IS VERY NICE BECAUSE I THINK AS SHOWN AND DR. ALICIA ALICIA IS MAP RIGHT WE KNOW WE HAVE DOZENS OF KAREN CALIFORNIA- AND AREAS WHERE WE HAVE LESS PROVIDERS BUT- WE ARE SHORT MEDICAL PROVIDERS EVERYWHERE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO WHAT WE CAN TO IMPROVE THAT SITUATION. AS WE INCREASE ACCESS TO MEDICARE WHICH WE DID THIS YEAR. NEED TO MAKE SURE WERE. INCREASING THE PROVIDERS OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA OVERWHELM YOU ANY OTHER. INCREDIBLE FIGHTERS OUT THERE AT BUT ON TOP OF THAT RIGHT NOW. WE'RE OBVIOUSLY HEARING A LOT ABOUT AND- STAFFING SHORTAGES. AT ALL LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. I'M AND I'M WONDERING HOW THAT HAS. AFFECTED YOUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE ON TOP OF THE SHORTAGE YOU ALREADY MENTIONED- DO YOU WANT TO. TAKE THAT FIRST STEP DECISIONS. SURE AND WE HAVE HAD SOME PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL STAFFING SHORTAGES AS YOU MENTIONED WHAT THE PHENOMENON THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD IN THE NEWS IS BAD- IN AREAS THAT ARE HARDEST HIT BY COALBED. THERE ARE OFFERING HUGE INCENTIVES FOR NURSES TO TRAVEL NURSES TO GO THEIR WORK FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME GET PAID SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY- AND THAT'S ACTUALLY PULLING AWAY FROM OUR OUR- STAFF NURSES- AT MOST OF OUR HOSPITALS. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WE HAVE MAJOR STAFFING SHORTAGES ON OUR LABOR AND DELIVERY FLOOR OPERATING ROOMS AND WE ARE HUGELY LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF CARE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR MEDICAL PATIENTS- CURRENTLY WE'RE LIMITED TO THAT WE HAVE THIS. AT JUST TO GIVE SOME BACKGROUND SO SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS- DURING THE PANDEMIC WAS THAT- NON ESSENTIAL SURGERIES NON EMERGENT SURGERIES BOARD THE LATEST OF THINGS THAT WERE DEEMED ELECTIVE SURGERIES- FOR EXAMPLE- AS- THE WOMEN WHO HAS- REALLY REALLY HEAVY MENSTRUAL BLEEDING. I'M TO THE POINT WHERE SHE BECOMES ANEMIC NEEDS MULTIPLE BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIFE THREATENING- AND OVERALL SHE'S STABLE SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER YOU KNOW. THINGS HAVE BOOSTED UP WITH A PANDEMIC TO BILL TO GET HER SURGERY FORTUNATELY UNFORTUNATELY SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD THAT ISSUE THERE ARE JUST SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAD THAT ISSUES OUR BACKLOG AS- YOU KNOW- NOT EMERGENT CASE SAYS. HAS JUST EXPANDED- AND NOW WE ARE FURTHER CONTACTED BY THIS LACK OF ALL OUR STAFF. AND THAT'S KIND OF CONTRACT IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WERE ABLE TO OPERATE SO FOR EXAMPLE MY OPERATING ROOM CAN ONLY FUNCTION FROM SEVEN IN THE MORNING AND TELL- THREE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN NORMALLY WE CAN GO BEYOND THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A SHIFT CHANGE AND THEN. AT THREE PM WE HAVE TO CUT DOWN TO ONLY THREE OPERATING ROOMS FOR THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL SO. IT BECOMES CHALLENGING THAT WAY BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT ONLY THIS HUGE BACKLOG BUT THEN ON OUR SIDE OF THINGS WHERE FURTHER CONTRACTED AND HOW MUCH WE'RE ABLE TO GIVE BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE. TO PROVIDE THAT CARE- AND SIMILARLY A LABOR AND DELIVERY SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO THREE NURSES FOR THE ENTIRE FLOOR WHICH IS. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES UNSAFE SO WE DO THE BEST WE CAN WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE BUT THE PANDEMIC IS POLLING STAFF- AWAY FROM. HERE IN. PLACES ARE MORE CARDS HIT BUT IT ON A- THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO WORK UNDER WHAT SEEM LIKE INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES- MISREAD ANYTHING TO ADD ON THE STAFFING SHORTAGE QUESTION- JUST THAT LIKE MANY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS YOU KNOW. A CLINICIAN SH STAFFING SHORTAGE YOU TO CODE NINETEEN WAS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR US- AND HOW DOES THEIR CLINICIANS AND HEALTH CENTER STAFF FOR MISSION DRIVEN AND COMMITTING TO PROVIDING THE ESSENTIAL CARE TO PATIENTS- BUT MUCH LIKE- IT. WAS STATED BEFORE IT HITS. HAVE AN IMPACT ON ACCESSIBILITY. THANK YOU I'M ACTUALLY A TURNED TO DR LISA WITH A QUESTION ABOUT THAT CANCER SCREENINGS AND YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM YOU ABOUT STI'S BUT I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IN THE AREA OF CANCER SCREENINGS AND WHETHER WE'RE SEEING THAT SAME DAY IF YOU SHOWED US FOR STI TESTING AS IT RELATES TO WHAT ARE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY LIFE THREATENING ILLNESSES. YOUR MUTED DOCTOR SHOWS THAT OUR FAULTS. OKAY BUT I'LL ANOTHER ANOTHER PRESENTATION ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE PRESENTED THAT- DATA IN A JAM UP ARTICLE AND WE SAW YOU KNOW THE LAY CARE YOU ARE RESULT IN ADVANCED- PRESENTATION CANCERS. IN COLORECTAL LUNG PANCREATIC I MEAN YOU NAME IT WAS THEIR PATIENTS COULDN'T GET IN FOR THE SCREENING AND YOU KNOW SO WHEN THEY'RE NOT GETTING IN FOR THEIR SCREENING OF A LOT OF THESE CANCERS THAT ARE GOING TO GO RAPIDLY GROW RAPIDLY AND THEY PRESENT AN ADVANCED STAGE SO THE ANSWER IS YES GO AHEAD OF SEEKING HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CANCER SCREENINGS CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHICH IS THE EARLY DIAGNOSTICS. OF CANCER- ANY I'D SAY THAT'S REALLY ACROSS THE BOARD AND IF I MAY JUST PICK UP ON WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER- KAREN EXISTENCE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE MINDSET- THAT WE'VE HAD FOR SUCH A LONG TIME A MEDIINE WHICH IS FOCUSED ON DISEASE MANAGEMENT DISEASE KAREN'S ADVANCED STAGES BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE ALL TRAINED AS NURSES AND DOCTORS TO TAKE CARE OF THE END STAGE. AND YEAH- AS I MOVED THROUGH MY CAREER- I'M REALIZING NOW THAT WE NEED TO PICK HIM UP EARLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A REAL IMPACT NOT ONLY ON THEIR LIVES THAT CAN IMPACT THE DOLLARS SO IF I CAN IDENTIFY IT THIS THIS. WOMAN- THIS PATIENT. WHAT WE- MINUTES ONE. CORRECT OKAY. YOU CAN SAY THE- YOU SAVE A LOT. STATED CHEMOTHER SAVED HOSPITALS THE GET BACK TO THE SAME THING HOLDS TRUE. COMEDY I GOT AND YEAH- YOU MENTIONED AS FOR THE SIMPLEST YOU KNOW AFTER THE ACT SAN THING. AND WE TO K. THEM EARLY. BECAUSE WE KNOW CO OF IT. AND THIS IS FOR MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT IF WE DON'TCATCH THEM EARLY AND WE DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY THEM. THEN THEY SHOW UP LATE AND THEY SHOW UP LATE. AS- THAT'S TO DIE HE SAID IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH UNCONTROLLED DIVE DIABETES. AND THAT'S WHEN IT GETS TO BE REALLY EXPENSIVE. SO THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION CIRCLING BACK IS YES WE HAVE SEEN A DROP IN DIAGNOSIS- FOR DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS AND WE'RE SEEING THEM SHOWING UP LATE- IN LATE STAGES OF CANCER. AND THAT'S ACROSS THE BOARD IN THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WHERE IT BREAKS YOUR HEART BECAUSE. YOU KNOW YOU COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THAT IS YOUR- IT'S ALTHOUGH ALASKA FOLLOW UP QUESTION ALONG THE THEME MY CAR. WHICH IS DO ANY OF YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US FOR HOW WE CAN HELP ENSURE CALIFORNIANS ARE GETTING THAT EARLY SCREENING AND EARLY DETECTION. YOU KNOW I SAW THAT YOU WENT TO GEORGETOWN AT MADAM CHAIR AND I WENT TO GEORGETOWN TO AND YOU KNOW YOU NEVER ASK YOUR TOP. IN IT YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE. AND THE ANSWER IS OF COURSE WE DO- SO I THINK THAT. FOR ME IT'S CHANGING THE MINDSET. AND WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT PREVENTION. I AND WE SAW THAT HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUT THAT'S A BIG STEP. I THINK IT'S PREVENTION EARLY DIAGNOSIS SCREENING ACCESS AND DOING THE SIMPLE THINGS REALLY REALLY WELL. WE GET FOCUSED ON ON THE HOSPITAL BASED WORKERS THAT SEXY THAT'S WELL THAT'S SUPER EXPENSIVE. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH BY. THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU MAKE THE BIGGEST IMPACT CAN MAKE THE BIGGEST IMPACT AT THE FRONT END. SO CHANGING OUR MINDSET. FOR SCREENING FOR HIM WELL WHEN THEY WON CITIES FOR COLORECTAL CANCER- GET THE GET THE PATIENTS BEFORE THE KIDNEYS ARE DESTROYED BY DIABETES OR OR THEIR EYES ARE DESTROYED BY DIABETES. GET THEM BEFORE THEY SHOW UP WITH PELVIC ABSCESSES BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DIAGNOSED. AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WE NEED TO SHIFT THE CONVERSATION. TO A MORE EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF SCREENING RESOURCES AND THEN. THE ABILITY. TO FOLLOW THOSE PATIENTS UP. THE YOU RESPOND. ALONG WITH LINES AND I THE REPHAIM FREE FRAME OF ONE CARE TO DISTANCE AND FOCUSING MORE ON A PREVENTATIVE CARE IN THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC AT BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE JOB LOSSES THAT MANY EXPERIENCED- I'M SURE THAT THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO NEEDED TO GET ON TO MEDICARE ALL INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY I WONDER- AND I THINK THAT DOCTOR AT. A LATER THIS MIGHT BE A QUESTION FOR YOU- I WONDER IF TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH AT THE MEDICAL SYSTEM AS IT IS SET UP RIGHT NOW- IT IS ADOPTING ENOUGH THE FRAMEWORK THAT YOU SUGGESTED AROUND A FOCUS ON PREVENTIVE CARE SCREENING AND- AND TESTING AND WATCH- WHAT IF ANYTHING YOU MIGHT AT ARE THERE OTHER FOR DOCTORS TO TASIA OR- A MYSTERY THAT MIGHT SUGGEST WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. MORE TESTING PREVENTATIVE CARE TO DEFERRED THAT THE FRONT LINE YOU KNOW PEOPLE AND THEN. FIGURE OUT LATER IT'S SUPPORT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAD CLASS. WITH YOUR OUR POWER IN AFFORDABLE CARE INITIATIVES IN OUR FOCUS ON- YEAH HEALTHEQUITY. WE CAN. HELP SUPPORT THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND I HAVE SOME IDEAS ON THAT BUT IF I MAY I THINK IT BE MORE OKAY. I ALWAYS LIKE TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES IN THERE ON THE FRONT LINES I'M- YOU KNOW I DON'T GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN DO. YOU KNOW C. SECTION. DELIVERIES ON TWENTY THREE WEEKS SIR YOU KNOW ERROR OR HAVE TO DEAL WITH A YOU KNOW A FULL LOAD OF PATIENTS IN THE CLINIC I'LL ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT I THINK THAT. IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU I JUST LIKE THE BEER FROM THE FRONT LAWN. IS THAT OKAY. YES PLEASE THIS FOR. DE CITY. THIS RARE YOU WANT TO GO FIRST SURE AND SO I GUESS TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE IS WE'RE NOT SEEING THE VOLUME OF TESTING LIKE DR ALLEGIANT SHOWED EARLIER IN THE AND- YOU KNOW WHAT IT DURING A SLIDE SHOW PRESENTATION AND NATURALLY DELAYED ROUTINE HEALTH CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC LEADS TO FEWER SCREENINGS AND MORE. AND IN HIGHER INFECTION RATE SO WHEN WE LOOK AT LIKE THE CDC REPORTS FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE GRADUAL INCREASE EVERY YEAR LIKE FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SYPHILIS BASED UP WILL BE NO. AND WITH LESS SCREENING VISITS THIS. IS NOT YOU KNOW THIS IS LIKELY TO BE THE CASE FOR TWENTY TWENTY AS WELL AS WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING MORE TREATMENT. AND MORE MANAGING AS THE LACK OF CARE THAT WEREMADE WERE SEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THIS COULD THEORETICALLY BE APPLIED TO OTHER AS GIANT SECTION RATES LIKE ON EVERY INCLUDE MEDIA. SO FOR EXAMPLE PLANNED PARENTHOOD COMPLETED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND LESS AS TI TEST IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE THAN WE DID IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY. SO WHAT I THINK IS THAT AND YOU IN GENERAL GENERAL FUND ENOUGH FOCUSES ON THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING AND SCREENING AND PILOTING NEW TESTING METHODS LIKE I'D MENTION PRIOR- WHETHER IT BE IN CLINIC RAPID TESTING ARE. LEVERAGING AT HOME TESTING SELF COLLECTION AND MAKING THAT MARK SACHS ACCESSIBLE FOR PATIENTS AND. EDUCATING THEM ON THE NEED FOR IT. WOULD BE SENT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. SO IF I MAY UM I'LL PICK UP ON THE AT HOME AND THE PATIENT SERVICE CENTER WE ONE OF THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CLASS. IS YOU KNOW THE WAY TO GET THAT THESE TO HELP- EVACUATE SEES ANOTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS- YEP MEET THE PATIENTS WHERE THEY ARE AND IF WE CAN'T DO IT AT THE HOME WE CAN DO IT. YOU KNOW IN THE IN OUR PATIENT SERVICE CENTERS AND WE HAVE WHAT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THIRTY PATIENT SERVICE CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND WE YEARS THAT YOU HAVE NOW- FOR- COLLECTION. SO RATHER THAN HAVE THEM COME TO THE- THE SITE YEAH A LOT OF FOLKS. CAN'T GET THERE BECAUSE THE WORKER. IT'S HARD TRANSPORTATION ANY NUMBER OF REASONS- YOU KNOW THEY CAN GO TO A LOCAL PSC PATIENTS SERVICE CENTER AND HOPEFULLY WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR WILL BE MOVING INTO A HOME COLLECTION. AND THEN WE WILL WE NEED TO GET BETTER ALIGNMENT YES SIR. I'M SURE WHAT WE COULD DO IT I THINK YOU. HAVING THIS DISCUSSION OF BETTER ALIGNED OF REESE. AND FOCUSING ON ON PREVENTION. OUT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE IF YOU WILL OKAY I THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE THE MINDSET AROUND THE US- AND CO THAT IS ACCELERATED A LOT OF THAT AND I SEE THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO. DISINTEGRATE TITLE DISRUPTION BUT ALSO A GREAT TIME TO LEAD BECAUSE WE SEE PATIENTS WILL EMBRACE TELEHEALTH BELUM BURKE BRACE NON HOSPITAL BASED. YOU KNOW CARE THEY'LL EMBRACE NON HOSPITAL BASED OR NON CLINIC BASED. TESTING AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GET OUR HEAD AROUND AND ALSO WITH ARMY WE HAVE A HUGE COMMITMENT. THE QUESTION I YOU KNOW. TO REALLY TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY I MEAN ALL THAT AND- AND THAT'S THAT'S A YOU KNOW WE'RE FOR A BIG COMMERCIAL LAB TO HAVE THAT- DEEP THE POPUP PART FELT- COMMITMENT TO. DIVERSITY TO THE- HEALTH INEQUITIES IS A BIG DEAL AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO THAT'S. WHERE WE WANT TO STEP UP AND HELP. THANK YOU DR CITY ANYTHING ON THIS- I DO HAVE TO AGREE MICHAEL HERE AND SEE THAT HER BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT- NEW WAYS OF PROVIDING PROVIDE CARE BE FOR. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DATA TO SHOW THAT PATIENTS ARE ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD AT IT- DOING AT HOME TESTING SO THINGS LIKE SELL STOPS FOR GONORRHEA CHLAMYDIA EVENED OUT STOP OUT SOMETHING SHOWN TO BE PRETTY- SO IF WE HAD. WOULD SUPPORT THOSE KINDS OF MEASURES- I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THAT. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF HESITANCY- AND I'M SURE EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF THAT SURROUNDING. AT HEALTH CARE CURRENTLY I THINK THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FEELING VERY DISTRUSTFUL. OF MEDICINE AT THE MOMENT AND SCIENCE AT THE MOMENT- AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN COMBAT THAT TO GET PEOPLE SEEKING CARE AGAIN IS JUST TO BE PROUD THAT I THINK PLANNED PARENTHOOD DOES A REALLY GREAT JOB OF BEING. LIKE IN THE COMMUNITY BEING SUPER PRESIDENT- AND BEING AND KNOWING RESOURCE FOR PATIENTS TO SEEK CARE FOR- AND SO SIR SUPPORTING UNITY- INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPORTING YOU KNOW- A LOT OF DIFFERENT. CLINICIANS HAVING ADDITIONAL TRUST AND IN- IN THE COMMUNITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO OVERCOME A LOT OF THE HESITANCY THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING. TO SEEK THEIR CARE. I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THANK YOU I AM- LEARNED EARLIER THIS YEAR ABOUT AT HOME RAPE KITS- AND IT WAS TO YOUR POINT I THINK WE'RE REVOLUTIONIZING THE WAY. PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HEALTH CARE AND ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO RECEIVE. HEALTH CARE- MOTIONAL AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAS DOCTOR WISHES THAT DISRUPT THE SYSTEM IN A POSITIVE WAY THAT ALLOWS MORE PEOPLE TO SEEK CARE TAXES CARED TO HAVE. CARE WITH THE SUPPORT THEY NEED- SO THANK YOU ALL I WANT I JUST THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR HELPING US LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT AND WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AND HOW WE CAN BE SUPPORTIVE OF IT. AT AND YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT THIS CAN CONVERSATION CONTINUES AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS- ENSURING THAT EVERYONE GETS THE CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT. AND NOT HAVING THE BEARS THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY TO ACCESS TO CARE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WOULD BE AT MOST HELPFUL. TO RECEIVE IT SO- THANK YOU ALL I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH EACH OF YOU ON SOLVING THESE PROBLEMS THANK YOU FOR YOUR GUIDANCE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. RIGHT SO IS OKAY MATTER CHAIR WAS OFF NOW YES. YOU CAN BEING OKAY. TO NEXT YEAH I'M PRETTY SURE. THAT YOU FIND OUT. IN HEY WE GOING TO MOVE TOURISTS PANEL WHICH- HEALTH CARE FOR PREGNANT PEOPLE IN CODE RED WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES THE COVE IT HAS PRESENTED FOR PREGNANT PEOPLE AND THEY WERE FACING A MYRIAD OF HEALTH STRESSES OUTSIDE OF BEING PREGNANT PREGNANCY- AND THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING BIRTH WASJUST AN ADDED STRESS DURING A PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW THAT THIS ADD TO SOMEWHERE BONTA IS POINT BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR WERE BOTH HIT HARD BY THE PANDEMIC AND THEN DEEPLY AFFECTED BY. THE LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE- BIG ON GOING CRISIS OF HIGH MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MEDICAL RACISM AND THAT IS EXPERIENCED- I KNOW THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD ON THIS- BOTH AS SUPERVISOR MITCHELL NOW SUPERVISOR MUCH ON HER WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE- AND ALSO AT SENATOR NANCY SKINNER WHO AUTHORED SB SIXTY FIVE LAST YEAR ALSO KNOWN AS THE MOM OF THIS BILL WHICH I DID INCREDIBLE INVESTMENTS INTO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH I'M PROVIDERS LIKE DO AS NURSE MIDWIVES AND POSTPARTUM CARE I'M ACTUALLY AN EFFORT THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY THAT BOTH THAT SOMEWHERE BONTA AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF. REPRESENTING THEY HAVE BEEN HARD AT WORK AT THIS FOR MANY YEARS AND SO IT'S FUN TO SEE IT COME TO THE STATE LEVEL- BUT IN THIS PANEL WE WILL HEAR FROM ADVOCATES AND PROVIDERS TO GIVE A SENSE OF CODES ONGOING IMPACT FOR MOTHERS PARENTS AND PREGNANT PEOPLE AND WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO THE PANELISTS INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND WE HAVE WITH US ON THIS PANEL LEAN CHRISSY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH ACCESS WE HAVE KERIS JOHN JEAN WHO IS A BIRTH DOULA.

OKAY GREAT I SEE SOME OF YOUR TOO SO THAT'S GREAT- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ONE PERSON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH ACCESS IN LOS ANGELES WHERE SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATION AND POLICY ORGANIZATION LOCATED. IN LA BUT WITH THE STATE MY POLICY REACH I'M PLEASED AND HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES TODAY WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL WE WORK MOSTLY WITH PEOPLE ON MEDICARE- MEDICARE ACCESS AND PER CALIFORNIA WHICH ALL TOGETHER COVER ABOUT HALF THE PRICE THE STATE'S PREGNANCIES I FOUNDED THIS ORGANIZATION IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHEN THEY ARE BIRDS WERE TAKING PLACE IN THE HALLS OF L. A. USC AT THE COUNTY AND AT THAT TIME THAT. INSTITUTION DELIVERED ABOUT ONE OUT OF EVERY TWENTY BIRDS IN THAT COUNTRY IT TOOK SIX WEEKS TO SIX MONTHS TO GET A FIRST PRENATAL APPOINTMENT AND ALL WE HAD WAS COUNTY SERVICES IN AMERICA WHICH DIDN'T COVER UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE SO WE HAVE COME A LONG LONG WAY. AND PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE ARE MANY CALENDAR WE DO ENROLLMENT AND TRAINING UP TO ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT HOW THESE PROGRAMS WORK- WE HAD A CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND FAMILIES AFFECT PEOPLE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS THE PROVIDE SUPPORT. UP TO TWO YEARS AND WE HAVE A HOME VISIT PROGRAM WHICH SEES ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FAMILIES YEAR MOST OF THE MARLETTE NECKS AND ABOUT THANK YOU GENERAL HERE. WE ALL CLASSES AND SUPPORT GROUPS. BY DOWN AND COULD OUTREACH FOR PREVENTION BUT- WE ARE. TO GET OUR PROVIDER. 38% OF PREGNANT WHO ARE BACKS. MUCH WOULD PROVIDE FREE MAN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. APART DURING HOPE. FROM AND SO OVER MANY SUPPORTS NOT EXIST FOR COULD NOT BE AT. OR COVERT KNOW IT'S LIKE WE'RE TALKING THE KIND ABSOLUTELY NOT BY TALKING ABOUT IT MORE TO A LOT. AND COMING OUT OF LOOKED- HELLO. PEOPLE I MET WE'RE NOT THE BEST OF. BEFORE CORPORATE WE CAN SAY THAT THE- WHO ALSO THE SAME BUT PRIVATE AND- THROUGH WORK OR A- INSURANCE. OR BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THEY CAN MOVE OUT OF IN CAP OR COVER CALIFORNIA INTO THREE MEDIC HEALTH SO OUR COMMUNICATION THERE IS NOT THE GREATEST. THIS GREAT DISPLAYS AN AVERAGE THREE YEARS TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH IS THE MOST RECENT STATE DATA. BUT PUT INSECURITY AT THE TIME WAS ABOUT 25% AND ALMOST 11% OF PREGNANT PEOPLE EXPERIENCED INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. AND WE ARE SURE WE WILL SEE HIGHER PERCENTAGES THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATE SURVEYS. BOB FOR HEALTH CARE MUCH HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT I WILL ADD THAT BEFORE THE VACCINE IN PERSON VISITS WERE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE- VISITS IT REALLY DO HAVE TO BE IN PERSON FOR CANCER DETECTION FOR BROKEN BONES ABOUT LIKE. FOR A POSSIBLE- AT HOME TEST ABSOLUTELY AND CAUSING A DISRUPTION I LOVE THAT TERM BOB BUT IT TOOK US THREE MONTHS TO GET OR ORTHOPEDIC CONSOLE FOR A WOMAN WHO FELL DOWN THE STAIS. ON THE STAIRS I THINK UP IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY. RECENT EXPLOSION AND DIABETES IN THE AREA PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED TO STAY INDOORS AND FOR THE MOST PART ARE. EXERCISING LASSEN INCREASING YOUR SCREEN SCREEN TIME- COMMUNICATION THAT LEADS FROM THE STATE- WERE NONEXISTENT BECAUSE I ASK WHAT ARE THE GUIDELINES FOR SEEING. PEOPLE DURING PREGNANCY- SOME PROVIDERS FOR SEEING PEOPLE EVERY OTHER VISIT SOME SET UP WELL THAT STUDENTS ARE TRIMESTER- AND MAYBE THEIR WORK REGULAR PROVISION BUSINESS PROVIDED SOMEONE WAS HIGH RISK AND EVEN NOW IN OUR AREA. LOCAL PROVIDERS ONLY SEEING WOMEN WHO. ARE PREGNANT PEOPLE ONLINE UP UNTIL THE THIRD TRIMESTER AND HAD REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THIS. TELEHEALTH HAS BEEN A HUGE IMPROVEMENT I NOTICED- THAT LOOK DIFFERENT TAKE ON THIS THAT ARE PRIOR. ANALYSTS BUT- ARE ONLY AND EVEN OUR OWN COMPLICITY PROGRAM IS INCREASE INCREDIBLY. BECAUSE IT IS IT'S A VIRTUAL. BUT WE ARE MEDICAL. AND THE PRODUCT AND RED FLAG NEEDS BE WORKED OUT FOR ME FUND PROVIDE. HAVE TO SEE SOMEONE IN PERSON AT NOW IT THAT PREFERRED. ORBITS AND- BECAUSE OF THE- WHAT WE SEE IN THE DAY. THE BIGGEST COMMUNICATE I WOULD IS THE BILL YOUR TO LET PEOPLE KNOW MEDICARE OPTIONS. I WAS PREGNANCY AND SHOULDN'T BECAUSE OFF THIS IS THE CASE SINCE APRIL TWO TWENTY- AND IT'S ALSO THE CASE FOR YOUNG UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE REACH AGE TWENTY SIX MW BECAUSE- THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE COULD CHANGE. SO WE SHOULD SEE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE ON MEDI CAL- INCOME INCREASED REPORTS WORK- IF WE HAD REALLY DONE THAT. INSTEAD THE PROVIDERS HAVE ACCEPTED THAT MEDICARE. HYPERTENSIVE WOMEN COULD BE ABLE WHATEVER CHRONIC SITUATION EXIST COULD CONTINUE TO GET CARE. AND I'M GRATEFUL IT AND HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE POST. PARTUM TWELVE MONTH MOVEMENT- WITH SB SIXTY FIVE IN THE BUDGET- BUDGET WORK THANK. THAT IS REALLY EXISTED ALREADY IN THE STATE FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND NO ONE CLEARLY AND EFFECTIVELY TOLD THOSE MOST IN NEED WERE JUST STARTING TO GET NOTICES FROM THE STATE. WE ARE WE ARE- CIRCULATING THAT SAYING MEDICAL SHOULD CONTINUE AND YOU CAN CONTINUE TO SEE PREGNANT WAS PREGNANT. PEOPLE FOR EVERYTHING THEY- ARE WE REALLY A GREAT A CULTURE SUPPORT FOR PRACTICE THAT'S- WHATEVER HAVE. COME ON IN YOU TO BE SEEN CAUGHT A LOT TO THE CHILL HELP WHAT IT IS YOU CAN'T DID SEND AN ARTS TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT. MAN HEALTH A COVERS ALL. RELATED CARE RECALL CONSIDERED PEOPLE SCREW TO BUY THE SAYS L. DPO JUST FOR A ROTH INCLUDES IT'S A- IN LA BEFORE AFTER THE PANDEMIC ON MAJORITY OF THE DAY EXPERIENCE WOULD.

WELCOME DIGITAL DIVIDE WASN'T ISN'T HUGE HERE TO READ THE PROGRAM WE SPENT A LOT OF HOURS PEOPLE OUT HIS AND HARD TO UPLOAD DOC TO TAKE PICTURES AND ALL THESE PEOPLE PEOPLE HAD TO SCRAMBLE AND RUN FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND TRY TO. INTERJECT OR DOES THAT WERE CRASHING AND- IT WAS VERY DEPRESSING IN THE SKIRT DEMORALIZING. WE'RE HAPPY FOR THOSE PROGRAMS BUT- TOOK A LOT.

OH GOODNESS. OKAY PERHAPS NOT GETTING OUR SHARE. HERO HE THAT AIN'T. FORGIVE ME OKAY HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US. HELLO WHY DID EVERYTHING OKAY WELL. ARE YOU SHOULD HAVE TO SHARE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE AT. SANTA BARBARA MONUMENT- AT THE- SENATE NEXT TO START VIDEO- YES OKAY SO WHEN I CLICK FAT WHEN YOU CLICK OPEN SYSTEMS I GET A- BUZZ BOX THE TEXT BOX THAT SAYS OPEN SYSTEMS PREFERENCES OKAY IT MIGHT BE A WHOLE THINGS SO- GOSH MAYBE I'LL LEAVE THAT OUT I WE'VE GOT OUT AND IF SOMETHING COMES UP WE'LL- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. IT SUCKS KEEPMOAT- YEAH OKAY SORRY SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- MY NAME IS ON THE MOVIE CARE ACT AND I AM A POLICY ANALYST WITH A **** FOR WELLNESS AND BLACKMAN FOR HONEST ACTION PROJECT- AND AHEAD OF TOPIC THAT TALKS THAT. BREAKS DOWN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HE TWO BLACK ONE FOR WELLNESS IS A FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE AT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND TALKING POINTS ACTION PROJECT IS THE SISTER ORGANIZATION AND HOLDS A FIVE ONE THREE FOUR STATUS AND I LIKE TO SHARE THIS HISTORY OF BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS BEFORE IT WAS INCORPORATED AS A FIVE ONE TWO THREE IT STARTED OFF AS WITH A PROGRAM CALLED THE XIN GHAZI PROGRAM AND- THAT SOME GUYS THE IS A SWAHILI WORD THAT WHEN TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH MEANS AREN'T. AND THAT PROGRAM ACTUALLY PAIRED PREGNANT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WITH MENTORS ARE ON THAT- WOULD TO SORT OF GUIDE THEM AND SUPPORT THEM AND OFFER YOU KNOW GUIDANCE AND ASSISTANCE THROUGH ARM THEIR PREGNANCY AND UP TO A YEAR POST PARTUM- AND SOUL WITH THIS IN. THE EARLY NINETIES. BUT BLOCKING HOMELESSNESS IN FACT IN. WAS THIS IS INSECTS OF THE OR- AND SO FOR YEARS AFTER THIS YOUNG GHAZI PER. THE OR- DECIDE TO- BECOME OFFICIAL AND CREATE WHAT IS NOW BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS AND SO- IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WE RECEIVED FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE STATUS- AND SORT OF STARTED TO WORK AND MOVE UPSTREAM TO ADDRESS SYSTEMS AND POLICY- TO SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF BLACK PARTY PEOPLE RIGHT- AND SO THE ACTION PROJECT IS THE FIBER ONCE BEFORE AND THAT IS OUR WHERE A LOT OF OUR POLITICS AND OUR POLITICAL WORKING OUR LEFTOVER WORK COMES OUT BUT THAT'S ALSO WHERE OUR POLICY STATES AND SO. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT- AND SO WERE THE ONLY REFLECTIVE JUSTICE FACULTY FOR CALIFORNIA- WHICH IS HUGE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE I HAD WAS A BEAUTIFUL SLIDE THAT DEFINED WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TO MEAN REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE- AND IT'S HUMAN RIGHT TO CONTROL OUR SEXUALITY OR GENDER OR WORK. IN A REPRODUCTION AND THAT RIGHT CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WHEN ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS HAVE BEEN COMPLETE ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL POWER AND RESOURCES TO MAKE HEALTHY DECISIONS ABOUT OUR BODIES OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES IN ALL AREAS OF OUR LIVES. AND SO THAT DEFINITION THAT FRAMEWORK GROUNDS ALL OF OUR WORK AND IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH FIELD THERE IS THIS- CONCEPT HEALTH IN ALL POLICIES RIGHT AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING WHEN WE CREATE POLICIES WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS HEALTH IN ALL OF THOSE POLICIES THAT WE CREATE SO AS. TO ACHIEVE YOU KNOW. GREAT PUBLIC HEALTH OR WHAT RIGHT AND SO FOR US WE LOOK AT IT IS R. J. AND ALL POLICIES WE TAKE THAT APPROACH SO AS TO ENSURE THAT WE ADVOCATE FOR AN ADVANCE POLICIES THAT ARE HOLISTIC. INTERSECTIONAL AND REFLECT THE BASIC TENETS OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. FROM SO UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS THE NEXT SLIDE I HAD WAS. EXPLAINING IT WAS A CHART THAT SORT OF HIGHLIGHTS THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF MATERNAL HEALTH UP IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT AND SO I JUXTAPOSED THESE TWO CHARTS ONE IS A COMPARISON BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND HOW CALIFORNIANS DOING AS COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO OVERALL MATERNAL. HEALTHCARE OR MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE AND THAT CHART ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO CLAP FOR ITSELF IMPACTS OPENED BACK BECAUSE WE ARE DOING SO WE'RE FARING BETTER. RATE AS THE DATA STANDS THEM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND THEN THE SECOND CHART THAT I HAVE JUXTAPOSED. NEXT TO IT ON THIS. ON THE SLIDE IF YOU ONLY A- IS A COMPARISON RIGHT IT TAKES A CLOSER LOOK OF THE STOCKS WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND COMPARES- BIRTHING PEOPLE OF VARIOUS RACES AND WHAT THAT REVEALS IS YOU KNOW- I'M MORE DISCONCERTING AND DISHEARTENING STORY RIGHT- WE SEE THAT BLACK WORKING PEOPLE- SUFFERED. TREMENDOUSLY RATE THE DISPARITY IN XP GREEN JUST AT THIS POINT AND SO- A RECENT ACTUALLY REPORT- BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WAS JUST RELEASED- IN SEPTEMBER I BELIEVE- REVEALED THAT BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THE PREGNANCY RELATED MORTALITY RATIO FOR BLACK WOMEN WAS FIFTY SIX POINT TWO. LIVE BIRTHS FOUR HUNDRED THAT. FIFTY SIX POINT TWO DEATHS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVE BIRDS RIGHT- ARM AND THAT'S THAT MAKES IT FOUR TO SIX TIMES THAT OF OUR COUNTERPARTS RIGHT AND THIS NUMBER IS UP FROM FORTY FIVE POINT THREE. DEATHS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVE BIRTHS FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY THIRTEEN SO WHAT THAT REVEALS RIGHT THESE ARE THE MOST CURRENT NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THIS DISPARITY IS WIDENING. AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC RATE- AND WE DO THAT THIS WAS THE CASE BECAUSE THE COUNTY WIDE NUMBERS SORT OF TELL US THIS RATE DEPENDING ON WHAT COUNTY YOU ARE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH OFFER MORE RECENT DATA- WE SEE THE DISPARITIES ARE EVEN GREATER THAN. WHAT'S WHAT'S REVEALED STATEWIDE SO- I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SORT OF POINT THAT OUT IN SHARE I THINK AND I APOLOGIZE AND THEN MY LAST SLIDE. WAS TO JUST SHARE THAT. BLACK WELLNESS. OUR OUR MATURE LIKE OUR RESPONSE HAS BEEN BOTH PROGRAM. AND LET AND WORKING ON HIGHLIGHT THREE OF POLICY ONE OF MENTIONED EARLIER. SB FOUR SIX FOUR RIGHT- SO WE'VE PASSED LIKE THREE POLICIES- IN COALITION WITH PHENOMENAL ORGANIZATION TO RAPE AND EXCELLENT MIDWIVES AROUND HERE GREAT PARTNERS- THAT HAVE TO DO WITH. ADDRESSING THE DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PERFECT PEOPLE RIGHT BREAKING PEOPLE OF COLOR AND SO I JUST WANT HIGH LIKE THOSE THREE REALLY QUICKLY AND THEN I'LL STEP BACK. SB FOUR SIX FOUR WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA DIGNITY AND BURKE IN PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH ACT AUTHORED BY BE PHENOMENAL AVENUE SENATOR THEN SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN. THE JUSTICE AND EQUITY IN MATERNITY CARE ACT WHICH- SOUGHT TO REMOVE PHYSICIAN'S SUPERVISION VEST- FOR OF MIDWIVES- THAT'S EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE BECAUSE- MEMBERS LED THAT I HAD SPOKE TO THE MATERNITY CARE DESSERTS THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE BY THERE ARE AT LEAST NINE COUNTIES. THAT DON'T HAVE AN OBGYN SO BY REMOVING THIS PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION WE ALLOW OTHER QUALIFIED PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE CARE AND FILL IN THOSE GAPS- AND THEN WE HAVE OUR MOST RECENT WIN SB SIXTY FIVE- CALIFORNIA MOM THIS BILL. AUTHORED SB TWELVE THREE SEVEN WITH AUTHORED BY THE WILL DIE. AND SB SIXTY FIVE A CALIFORNIA MOM MISSED BILL AUTHORED BY THE FOR. SENATORS AND- YOU KNOW AND SOME MEMBER- YOU ALREADY. WHAT ALL THAT DOES AND- EITHER SORT OF A POLICY WAS- IN AN ATTACK TO. WORK ON ELIMINATE THIS- BECAUSE WE ALSO KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF THESE DISPARITIES LIKE A NUMBER OF THESE MATERNAL DEATHS ARE IN FACT PER PREVENTABLE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THEM AND SO- ADDRESSING ISSUES LIKE IMPLICIT BIAS AND RACISM WHICH WE KNOW. TO BE APPROVED BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF THESE DEATHS- IS CRITICAL AND SO WE'RE WORKING TO ADDRESS THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE APOLOGIZE MUCH MUCH LIGHTER COLORS. AND ANYWAY THANK YOU THEM TO US SO THAT WE CAN THEM OUT. THE YEAH NO THANK YOU FOR THAT ONE INTRODUCTION AND I KNOW BOTH OF US AND THE REST OF THE MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY TO SEE THOSE FIVE I KNOW IT IT'S THE NUMBER I HEAR OFTEN THAT A BLACK WOMAN IS FOUR TO SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE THAN I AM DURING CHILDBIRTH BUT IT SHOCKS HEAR IT SO I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT FACT AND THE FACT THAT IT IS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE DURING THE PANDEMIC IS PART OF WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. AND FOR THOSE EITHER LISTENING TO THE FIRST PANEL WHEN DOCTORS WHO TASIA TALKED ABOUT HER PATIENTS WHO DIDN'T SEE CARE DESPITE HER OVERWHELMING- DIABETES UNTIL AFTER HALFWAY THROUGH HER PREGNANCY WE START TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATES THESE PROBLEMS AND WE NEED TO. BE DOING EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS GET ACCESS TO CARE- I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE TO ASK A QUESTION WHICH IS YOU STILL HAVE THE SHINGLES THE PROGRAM. YOU SAID IT WAS A YEAR BEGINNING BUT I WONDER I MEAN I FEEL LIKE HAVING BEEN A PREGNANT PERSON. AND SOMEONE WITH INCREDIBLE CARE. I DON'T KNOW AN ANTI PROGRAM IS JUST SUCH AN AMAZING IDEA. READ AGREED UNFORTUNATELY- IN THIS MOMENT WE GAP OKAY MA'AM. BUT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T. LOOK FOR FIGHTING FOR HOME VISITATION THE THINGS ARE WELL- I GET MY SPELL WHICH WE KNOW AGAIN IT. THE DATE ON LISTEN. TO DO AS A SPECIAL FOR WOMEN OF. IS REALLY INCREDIBLE AND HOW IT AFFECTS MATERNAL MORTALITY AND BIRTH OUTCOMES FOR THE UNBORN- SO. IT AT FAN WAY TO PER AUNTIES. WE CONTINUE THAT WORK AND WELL THANK YOU ALL FOR THAT I THINK- YOU KNOW WE'VE REALLY ALREADY BEGUN TO HIGHLIGHT A LOT OF WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE- DURING THE PANDEMIC AND SO- YOU KNOW AND I THINK- SO WE ACT A KIA REALLY TALKED AT THE END ABOUT THE POLICY THAT IS PASSED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS TARGETED AT THIS ISSUE OF ACCESS AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND I GUESS I WOULD ASK FOR ANY OF USE OF COMING TO THIS POINT A PANDEMIC WHERE DOES NOT OVER BUT WE IN OUR LIVING WITH IT AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO LIVE WITH THAT- WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE FOR US FOR WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN FOR THESE INCREASED- NEGATIVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE HAPPENING FOR WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. WHO ARE BIRTHING WILL THE BACKWARDNESS BIKE YEAH DO YOU WANT TO START. THANK YOU THIS IS. APPROPRIATE OR IF IT'S APPROPRIATE BUT EXPEDIENT ENOUGH BUT I THINK STILL THAT- REALLY ADDRESSING THESE BEES DISPARITIES IN THESE ISSUES THEIR POLICY IS CRITICAL- AND SO AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARMED WITH THEIR EARS TO THE GROUND SORT OF INFORMING THE POLICY ARM RECOMMENDATIONS AND- IN STORE IN TURN THE LEGISLATION THAT'S PASSED- IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS- ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES BECAUSE IT. CREATES CHANGE ON A SYSTEMS WIDE LEVEL- AND CAPTURES A BROADER- SECT OF THE COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW AND SO FOR ME I THINK I REALLY DO BELIEVE IN POLICY- INNOVATIVE POLICY POLICY THAT'S EXPENSIVE- AND SORT OF PUSHES. DOWN IS CRITICAL TO REVIEW THE EFFECTING CHANGE IN THIS ARENA AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TOO BIG. OF AN ANSWER OR THAT'S NOT. IS IMMEDIATE MAN THAT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF- INNOVATIVE LEGISLATION TO. YOU KNOW TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SHE'S READY TO JUMP IN AND SHE SAID SHE FELT PROCLAIMS HERSELF A MEDIC CAL NERDS SO WE'LL TURN IT OVER TO HER FOR WHAT SHE THINKS WE CAN BE. DOING IN THIS SPACE. I'M PROBABLY TURNING RED- THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT ONE IS THE YOU KNOW OUR OUR FAVORITE PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN WITH US SINCE THE MID EIGHTIES AND HAS- IS EVIDENCE BASED- AND SUPPORTED BY FEDERAL FUNDING AND THAT IS CONFERENCE OF PERSONAL SERVICES- WE DON'T OVERSEE IT WELL ENOUGH AND- IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE A REAL DEEP DIVE INTO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT PROGRAM- MANAGED CARE IS NOW THE WAY OF THE WORLD FOR MEDICAID ALL- PREGNANCIES IN JANUARY ALL PREGNANCIES WILL BE IN MANAGED CARE EXCEPT FOR UNDOCUMENTED. WHICH DOES CONCERN US THAT KIND OF SPLIT HOW WILL THE CREATED MEDI CAL FOR A DOCUMENT THAT IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE MANAGED CARE WILL THAT BE THAT PERCEPTION. BUT- S. DOES THIS DETERMINANTS OF OR WHAT WE'RE TO ABOUT HERE. THAT IS WHAT CPSDOES THIS CEDARS PARK- NEEDS AND SO THE FACT THAT MANAGED CARE DOES NOT GENERALLY THOSE SERVICES. ARE PLANNING FOR IT THEIR INITIAL- HE WAS OR OR OR- CAPITATION WAS INCREASED TO INCLUDE CPS BEING AND THEY DON'T REALLY DO IT- SO WE NEED TO WE NEED TO LOOK INTO THAT- I WOULD ALSO SAY THE THINGS I SAID. DURING THE PRESENTATION RICHARD YOU KNOW CUT FEES AND THINGS LIKE THAT- DELIVERY FOR CALFRESH- PROVIDE HOME DELIVERY FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET OUT OR SHOULD NOT GET OUT- TELL PEOPLE THAT MEDICARE CONTINUES. EMBRACE PREGNANCY AND- THEN THE NEED FOR NOT NOT TO BE PREGNANT IF SOMEBODY CHOOSES NOT TO BE AND SAY YOU CAN GET THAT IT'S OKAY- BUT- LET'S NOT TURN PEOPLE AWAY WHO HAVE A NEED BECAUSE THE PROVIDERS AFRAID OF NOT GETTING. PAID AND WE SEE THAT WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH INTERRUPTIONS IN COVERAGE. WHICH SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING BUT THEY DO. AND THERE'S NOT A CULTURE- AGAIN AND LIKE LET'S JUST SEE PEOPLE ANYWAY. LET'S LET'S TRY TO SET THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF HER. BECAUSE I'M SURE THE PROVIDERS DON'T GET PAID OFF AND IN THE BIG STEP THEY CAN'T A PRODUCT THAT WAY. SO YOU KNOW THE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS. I GO TO- AND THEN I. HOW WE ARE WE GET TO US ARE WE GET A- WHAT CAN WE TO IMPROVE. CARE FOR WOMEN PROVED. FOR WOMEN PREGNANT PEOPLE NEED TO. KNOW IF THERE'S ANY WHO'S NOT BE GO COLD- IT'S PREGNANT PEOPLE AND HOW CAN WE TELL PROVIDE. THIS IS TURNING INTO DOES BECAUSE I HEARD THAT EVEN FROM. A MINISTER OF THESE PROGRAM WELL YOU KNOW WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T LIKE THE BOAT WITH THE HOSPITALS AND WE CAN'T DO THIS THE CLINICS WILL YOU CANNOT IT'S THAT WE DO NOT WANT PREGNANT PEOPLE STAY WITH COBRA AND WE WANT YOU TO GET THESE VACCINATIONS. SO TRANSPOSER MIGHT. YOU. RECOMMENDATIONS A YOU MISS GARCIA AT IN THE FOR PANEL IT. IT COMES UP OFTEN IN CONGRESS AROUND REPRODUCTIVE CARE THERE'S NO QUESTION THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT IS. TOP OF THE LIST FOR INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE WITHOUT PROPER REIMBURSEMENT AND PAYMENT WE DON'T HAVE THE PROVIDERS OR ACCESS TO THE CARE AS YOU MENTIONED OF AN ATTITUDE OF JUST COME AND LET ME TAKE CARE OF YOU LET ME SEE- AND- ENDS WITHOUT THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT OF TELEHEALTH. RIGHT I KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF HAVING AGAIN BEEN PREGNANT THREE TIMES MYSELF I UNDERSTAND THE BENEFIT OF BEING IN THE ROOM WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN. BUT IF IT PROVIDES ACCESS TO SOMEONE WHO OTHERWISE WOULDN'T LOCK IN RATE AND TELEHEALTH IS A REALLY IMPORTANT- TOOL IN THE ARSENAL ENSURING EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO CARE FOR NOT REIMBURSING FOR IT AND IT'S NOT. REALISTIC TOOL- SO THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- AND NOW MISS JACKIE DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING ON. WHAT SHOULD WE BE FOCUSING ON IN THIS MOMENT. L. AND MY MINDSET IS ALWAYS AT PRE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO POST PANDEMIC SO ALL MY ANSWERS ARE AT. IT THE APPLY NOW WEBER IN THIS CRISIS BUT THEY DON'T STOP WHEN THE CRISIS HAS BEEN MANAGED OR MITIGATED AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD IMPLORE FOLKS WHO DO THE POLICY WORK WHO CREATE THESE EMIGRATE IF WAYS TO ADDRESS RACISM AND BIAS AND ALL OF THESE THINGS- THAT THAT YOU ENSURE THAT THE LANGUAGE. DOESN'T ZAENTZ AND BARRIERS TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE ALREADY DOING THIS WORK THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING THAT THIS IS DEFENDING OF THE AUNTIES YOU KNOW BREAKING PROJECT IS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND THAT WAS THE WHOLE CONCEPT WAS PREGNANT WOMEN. BEING SISTERS TO PREGNANT WOMEN BECAUSE WHO YOU TELL EVERYTHING TO YOUR BIG SISTER RIGHT NOT SOME PERSON ON CROSSTOWN WHO DOESN'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM YOU KNOW IT WAS ONLY GOING TO SEE YOU FOR THREE AND A HALF OF THE SEVEN MINUTES. THAT IS YOUR APPOINTMENT SLOT- I THINK THAT IT IS IN A LOT OF WAYS I'M FAIR TO ASK PROVIDERS TO DO. I'M WORK THAT THAT THERE ISN'T CAPACITY FOR AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN. DO THE WORK WHO DO YOU DO THE WORK M. C. PH W. YOU KNOW FOUR THAT WAS MY FIRST JOB LAKE THAT WAS MY FIRST PAYCHECK IN MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH. WHEN IT WAS TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE ASSESSMENTS FOR PREGNANT MOMS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR NEEDS WERE MET NOT THAT I JUST DOCUMENTED THEIR NEEDS BUT MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE NEEDS WERE MET. AND WE TALK ABOUT. HERE AT HOME WELL. YOU'RE IS IN YOUR- AND THE CARE EXISTS THERE SO IF THERE'S A WAY FOR YOU TO I'M- TO BUILD BACK IN AND ALSO WITH WITH A LOT OF. TRUTH TO DECISION MAKING ABILITY FOR THESE AGENCIES THAT ARE TASKED WITH THIS SO THAT WHEN SOMETHING DOESN'T FIT IF YOU'VE GOT A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE THEY HAVE PERMISSION TO CREATE US. WHERE HOLE RIGHT SO THAT IT CAN WORK SO THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL YOU'VE GOT YOUR EXPERTS ALREADY YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FIND NEW PEOPLE TO DO THIS WORK LIKE THEY'RE ALREADY OUT THERE IN THE TRENCHES WE SAY WE DO IT FOR THE OUTCOME NOT THE INCOME. MOSTLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO INCOME- BUT EVEN WITHOUT THAT LIKE YOU KNOW THESE DISPARITIES DON'T CHANGE WITH SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS AMONG BLACK WOMEN- WHEN WE SAY YOU KNOW OLD BLACK WOMAN IS TWO OR THREE OR FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY- WHAT WE'RE AYING IS THAT A BLACK WOMAN WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE IS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A POOR OUTCOME. THAN A CAUCASIAN WOMAN LIVING IN A HOMELESS SHELTER IF WE. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE TO CREATE A WAY TO DO IT YOU JUST HAVE TO CREATE A PATH FOR THOSE WHO ARE DOING IT TO HAVE MORE ACCESS TO THOSE WHO HAVE MORE NEEDS. AND NOT I AM. NOT AN INCH. A. N. AND I KNOW THAT'S A STRONG WORD BUT NOT PUNISH THE FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO FIND ALTERNATIVES YOU KNOW IF YOU CREATE. THE ACCESS TO MIDWIFERY CARE I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I WAS APPROACHED ABOUT ATTENDING FREE BIRTH. I DON'T PRACTICE MEDICINE I CAN'T SUPERVISOR BIRTH MEDICALLY RIGHT BUT IF YOU'RE SCARED TO DEATH OF GOING TO THE HOSPITAL AND I'M SCARED TO DEATH YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY IN A MOTEL SIX. ONE OF MY SUPPOSED TO DO RIGHT THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO BRIDGE. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY HAPPENING AND NOT HAPPENING JUST BE LITTLE SEGMENTED. TRENDY TOPICS OF THE MOMENT BECAUSE THESE ARE OUR LIVES AND WE SAVE A MATTER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR LIVES. NOTHING ABOUT MOVEMENT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A MOMENT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A AN ISOLATED INCIDENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. EVERY DAY. ALL DAY. OUR LIVES. THANK YOU I THINK I REAL TALK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. MANY PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR IT AND- RIGHT IT'S NOT A SLOGAN AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WE NEED TO DO THE WORK AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE IT NOW. I DO HAVE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION WHICH HE SAID IS THE PEOPLE ARE THERE- I KNOW THERE ARE AMAZING INCREDIBLE PEOPLE LIKE EVERYONE ON THIS CALL AND EVERYONE IN THE TRENCHES TODAY. BUT MY GUESS WOULD BE WE NEED MORE MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO PROVIDE THE DO LESS SERVICES WE NEED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO BUT- JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT COMMON OF YOURS. I WOULD ARGUE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS AMONG. THE GROUPS UNTIL AS THAT FOR THE WORKABLE OVER THERE IRAQI IN TRAINING WILL BE CATIONS ALL THESE. AND SELL ONLY TELL YOU WERE OUT THERE WERE OUT THERE THERE. OF OUR PEOPLE THIS WORK ARM IN WAYS THAT MAKE SENSE CULTURALLY FOR THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE SEEKING THE SUPPORT BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO IN REINVENT THE WHEEL THE WHEEL IS ALREADY THERE. THE BILL HAS ALREADY YET BUT BUT THERE AREN'T THERE'S LANGUAGE IN LEGISLATION THERE'S LANGUAGE AND NEW PROGRAMS BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT NOT ONLY CREATES BARRIERS TO THE CLIENTS WHO NEED THE CARE HAVING ACCESS TO IT I PRESENTS BARRIERS FOR THOSE WHO WOULD PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. AND SO THAT'S A BIG ASK THAT THAT YOU REMOVE THOSE THINGS- BUT TAKE CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY AREN'T. AND THAT IF WE IF WE SAY HEY GUYS THIS IS GONNA BE A PROBLEM- THAT IT BE JUST AS VALID AS IT AS- FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS HAS A LICENSE TO PROVIDE MEDICINE THOSE OF US WHO HAVE THE HEART TO PROVIDE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOLISTIC CARE. THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE. BE BACK ARE ARE. RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD A. B. LISTEN TO ALSO WELL AND GIVEN JUST AS MUCH. BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT THERE TO WORK LARA THANK YOU AND I MEAN TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU ON THIS CALL I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT AS WE CRAFT-LEGISLATION- I THINK IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE OUR OWN BLIND SPOTS RIGHT BE IT- CREDIT EXPERIENCE OUR RACE OR GENDER AND- AND IT IS CRITICAL IN THAT PROCESS FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO BE A VOICE TO HELP US SEE WHAT WE DON'T SEE- AND SO I INVITE YOU AS WE DO THOSE THINGS TO BE IN CONVERSATION WITH ME MY COLLEAGUES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE SEE THE WAY THESE IMPACTS- LANGUAGE IMPACTS COMMUNITIES BECAUSE I THINK IT IS. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US UNDERSTAND YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND I KNOW NOT ALL PERSPECTIVES HONESTLY BE THE SAME BUT IT'S OUR JOB TO LISTEN TO THEM AND THEN COME TO WHAT WE BELIEVE IS IN THE INTEREST OF- ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S WOMAN. PAUL I DO SEE AND I WAS JUST RETURN TO MISS MOVED VERY. TURN TO ON THIS QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH- I AM THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER AND THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IS JUST- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS- BAKER THE CAT MISSING READING CORRECTLY I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE A PARTNERSHIP THAT SHE MENTIONED THE LAST THREE BILLS THAT- BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS. ACTION PROJECTED PASSED AND IT WAS. OUR SUCCESS SHARED WITH YOURS AND WE HAVE NEVER EVER EVER WE'VE NEVER BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL AS WE HAVE BEEN IN OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS UNTIL WE FOLLOWED. BLACKLICK LEADERS. AND ORGANIZATIONS PLACARD ORGANIZATIONS. LIKE YOURSELVES AND SO WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL. AND IN THAT WAY. I HEAR SO MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE FOR PEOPLE- THE SENATE BILL TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN WHICH REMOVED THE RESTRICTION OF PHYSICIAN PERMISSION FOR MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE THE INTENTION THERE WAS TO ALLOW MIDWIVES TO GO TO COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT- MATERNITY CARE PROVIDERS AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT EVEN AS WE SPEAK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WORKING ON- AND JUST AS SO MANY OTHER YOU KNOW WELL INTENDED POLICIES DO. THIS PARTICULAR ONE UNVEILED ANOTHER RESTRICTION THAT EXISTS IN THAT IS ACCESS TO PRACTICE WITHIN THE HOSPITALS BECAUSE HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO ALLOW MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE THERE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COUNTIES IN OUR STATE THAT HAVE NO OBGYN PROVIDER OR THOSE THAT ARE VERY SCARCELY- PROVIDED WHERE WE ONLY HAVE A FEW UNDER THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF PROVIDERS. WE'VE GOT MIDWIVES WERE WILLING TO GO THERE NOW WE'RE READY TO GO THERE NOW AND THEY CERTAINLY COULD OPEN UP HOME BIRTH PRACTICES THEY CERTAINLY COULD OPEN UP FREESTANDING BIRTH CENTERS AND FOR A LOT OF WOMEN IN BIRTHING PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND THAT WOULD BE FINE- BUT NOT EVERYBODY WANTS AN OUT OF HOSPITAL BIRTH NOT EVERYBODY'S A CANDIDATE FOR IT OR SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN IT THAT IS THE INTENTION. THOSE WOMEN BIRTHING PEOPLE MIGHT NEED TO OR CHOOSE TO TRANSFER TO A HOSPITAL SETTING FOR SOME REASON AND THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR THOSE TRANSFERS IS A NATURAL OR FOR LABOR AUGMENTATION- BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE WITHIN THE INDEPENDENT SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR MIDWIVES BUT THERE ARE BARRIERS TO MIDWIVES BEING ABLE TO PRACTICE TICKET. OUT PRIVILEGES AND HOSPITALS WITHOUT PHYSICIAN ENDORSEMENT OR OPPOSITION- PERMISSION SO I SEE I SEE A NEED NOW FOR US TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET MIDWIVES INTO THOSE CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THAT DON'T HAVE OBGYN PROVIDER- SO THAT DON'T HAPPEN. OR COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE- MIDWIVES WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WHO PREFERMENT WITH FREE CARE. ABOUT THEM ANOTHER THING I'M HEARING IS MEDIC HOW. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR ASSOCIATION IS WORKING ON. A GRISLY RIGHT NOW WE ARE FORTUNATE TO BE INVOLVED IN A MIDWIFERY LEARNING COLLABORATIVE- WE WERE SELECTED AS ONE OF FIVE STATES. TO WORK ON A PROGRAM TODAY INCREASING ACCESS TO MIDWIFERY SERVICES THROUGH MEDICARE ALL AND ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT'S COME UP FOR US OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN ITS REIMBURSEMENT- A SEQUESTER WAS PUT INTO PLACE I WANT TO SAY IN TWO THOUSAND TEN- WHERE PROVIDERS. HAD THEIR MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT REDUCED BY ABOUT 10% AND THAT WAS REVERSED FOR A POSITION COLLEAGUES- BUT IT HASN'T BEEN FOR MIDWIVES AND SO WHILE IT IS HARD TO GET MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT. PERIOD THAT'S AN ISSUE. IT'S EVEN MORE OF AN ISSUE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET MADE WITH FREE ACCESS- AND MIDWIFERY REIMBURSEMENT BEING REDUCED RIGHT NOW SOTHAT'S- THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD ACT THEY COULD. ACT TO- INCREASE OR TO MOVE THAT'S A QUAESTORS THAT MIDWIVES PHYSICIAN COLLEAGUES ARE- AND THERE BUT THERE WILL. AND HEREBY INCREASE ACCESS TO MIDWIFERY CARE FOR MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE- BIRTHING PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER THING I'M HEARING IS- INCREASING OUR WORKFORCE RIGHT- AND HAVING CULTURALLY CONGRUENT REALLY IMPORTANT- SO GRATEFUL FOR THE MOM THE BEST AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT. THAT BILL DID WAS CREATE A MIDWIFERY WORKFORCE TRAINING FUNDS- AND THAT WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY GEARED TOWARD BRINGING MIDWIVES TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED ENHANCE. ALSO. BRINGING IN MIDWIVES OF COLOR TO READ OVER SUPPLY THE MIDWIFERY WORKFORCE IN OUR STATE AND WE SAY READ A VERSIFI ANYTHING THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT- ADDITIONALLY IF YOU GO BACK A FEW HUNDRED YEARS. MIDWIFERY BELONG TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY EVERY SINGLE CONTINENT HAD ITS OWN MIDWIVES- AND IT WASN'T UNTIL. THROUGH THE PROCESS VARIOUS PROCESS SEES A CONVERSATION- THAT MIDWIFERY WAS ELIMINATED AND THEN IT WAS BROUGHT BACK BUT ONLY WHITE AND SO NOW WE NEED TO TAKE THINGS BACK TO OUR ANCESTORS AND TO THE PEOPLE WHO STARTED IT HERE IN THE SPACE SO. AGAIN GRATITUDE FOR SB SIXTY FIVE HOPING TO SEE MORE DONE AND MY FRIENDS- AND AGAIN HOPING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS. THAT WE CAN GET MIDWIVES TO THIS CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS. IN THOSE COUNTIES THAT NEED THEM AND- GET ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR MIDWIVES WHO WANT TO ACCEPT MEDIC HELEN PROVIDE CARE TO THOSE PEOPLE. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE SERVICES. THANK YOU I AM AND I THINK THAT WE'VE TOUCHED ON A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS YOU KNOW CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE RIGHT ENSURING THAT OUR- CARE PROVIDERS ARE- AND THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE FRIE ENSURING THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING THAT AND NOT BLOCKING IT AND BY ANY MEANS- SO THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT ENDS AND THE IMPORTANT STUFF WE STILL HAVE TO GO I. HAD TO BE HONEST THAT WHEN SENATOR SKINNER INTRODUCED THE MOM OF A SPELL I THOUGHT THIS IS INCREDIBLE AND IT MAY TAKE THE REST OF HER TENURE TO GET IT PASSED SO THE FACT THAT. ONE YEAR WAS REALLY. INCREDIBLE FICO M. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ADVOCACY ON THAT BECAUSE I REALLY DO HOPE. THAT IT CHANGES A LOT OF THINGS IN CALIFORNIA AND- I THINK- IT IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE ARE SHOWING. THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD THE NATIONAND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOLLOW OUR LEAD. AND PROVIDE THIS CARE FOR WOMEN ACROSS THE NATION. AS SO- WITH THAT I WANT TO. ASK- I'M A CLOSING QUESTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO REALLY TELL THE STORIES OF THE WOMEN THAT YOU SERVE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THEIR VOICES TO BE HERE WITH US TODAY- BUT I JUST WONDER WHAT WAYS DURING THE PANDEMIC HAS THE GOVERNMENT'S STOOD IN THE WAY OF ACCESS TO CARE I KNOW THAT TO ME A COUPLE THINGS THAT COME TO MIND WAS THE RULES THAT PREVENTED AND PREGNANT PEOPLE FROM HAVING A PARTNER OR A DO THAT IN THE ROOM. HI DURING CHILDBIRTH WHICH WOULD HAVE TO SAY AGAIN HAVING BEEN A BIRTHING PERSON I CANNOT IMAGINE BEING ALONE IN THAT MOMENT I'M BEING TO ADDICT ABLE TO ADEQUATELY ADVOCATE FOR MYSELF- SO OBVIOUSLY THAT COMES TO MIND BUT I ALSO WONDER COMMUNICATIONS YOU KNOW WHAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE PRIOR PANEL AND HAS BEEN TOUCHED UPON I'M HERE IS- REALLY THEY NEED TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN THOSE WHO THAT ARE IN NEED OF CARE WHO ARE ACCESSING CARE AND PROVIDERS AND I THE COMMUNICATIONS- FROM THE GOVERNMENTS HOPING DURING THE PANDEMIC. I WONDER HOW THEY HAVE AFFECTED- YOU KNOW CARE AND THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE CARE SO I JUST REALLY IF- I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO START WITH THAT MAYBE I MISSED YOUR IDEA IF YOU WANT TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION ON THAT BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE. THE GOVERNMENT. I'M WELL. IT'S ALSO TO. SOLD THE GUIDELINES. AT NECESSARILY I GAS HAVE FALLEN SHORT WITH THE SPORADIC AND DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION WHICH YOU KNOW GRACIOUSLY BEGIN KNOWLEDGE NONE OF THIS IS NEVER BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE NONE OF US HAVE DONE AB HE A PANDEMIC BEFORE IT NOT POLICYMAKERS AND NOT THE SCIENCE THEY RELY ON. AND IT CAN'T HAPPEN FASTER THAN THIS. THEIR VIRUS. ADAM HAS REAL LIFE IMPACTED BUT FOR ME THAT THE FAILURE IS WHERE IT POLICIES CHANGE MIDSTREAM- EVEN I'VE I'VE BEEN AT A BIRTH FOR THE POLICY CHANGED WHILE I WAS THERE LIKE THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR. BEING WITH THAT FAMILY CHANGED A LOT I WAS THERE- AND SO OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE DO OUR PART WE HAVE A FAMILY CALL BEFORE YOU GET THERE AND ASK WHAT THE POLICIES ARE FOR VISITORS CALL WHEN YOU'RE LABOR STARTS TO ASK WHAT THE POLICY IS ASK THEM WHEN YOU GET THERE ASK THEM WHEN YOU HAVE THE BABY AND- AS OFTEN AS NOT. IT'S A DIFFERENT ANSWER EVERY TIME- AND THAT'S NOT JUST GOVERNING BODIES POLICIES THAT ADMINISTRATION OF HOSPITALS THAT'S YOU KNOW SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION- DEPENDING ON THE MOOD OF APHORISMS SHIFT AT THE TIME. AND EVERYBODY IS OVERWHELMED. AND THAT OVERWHELM IS VALID FOR EVERYBODY BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF HIM AND BEING OUT OF THEIR BODY IN THE MIDST OF IT AND SO I THINK THAT. THAT AND- ABOUT LACK OF REVIEWS ON THE ONE HAND TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU AS A PERSON WE TALK ABOUT AUTONOMY WE TALK ABOUT BEING ABLE ADVOCATE FOR OUR OWN BODIES. AND THAT SHOULD INCLUDE. YOUR BIRTH TEAMS RIGHT I MEAN I SHOULD BE AT THE TOWARD THE TOP OF THE LIST TUESDAY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE. YOUR BABY AND IT JUST IT BEATS THE TRAUMA THAT ALREADY THERE BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN ARE ALREADY AFRAID LIKE WHEN I STARTED. BEING A DELAY EVEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN BEING A DOULA WHEN I INTERVIEWED APPLYING IT YOU KNOW AND I SAY WHAT MAKES YOU WANT THE SERVICE. AND THEY WOULD HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS YOU EXPECT I WANT TO NATURAL BIRTH OR I WANT SOMEBODY THERE WHO CAN. GIVE ME MY OPTIONS OR I WANNA MAKE GOOD DECISIONS OR I WANT SOMEONE TO HELP MY PARTNER HELPED ME HAVE THIS BABY. AND THIS YEAR LAST YEAR THE ANSWER WAS I JUST DON'T WANT TO DIE. THAT WAS STOPPING HEART. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS THIS THIS THING IN THE SHIFTING POLICIES TAKE AWAY THE MAGIC OF THOSE INITIAL MOMENTS WHEN MOMS ARE AFRAID TO TAKE A CO THAT TEST NOT BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE SICK BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID IF IT HAPPENS TO TURN UP POP POSITIVE DOES THAT MEAN I'M GOING TO BE SEPARATED FROM MY BABY DOES THIS MEAN I GET TO BREAST FEED MY BABY DOES THIS MEAN SOMEBODY'S GOING TO CALL THE PEOPLE ON ME IF I DECLINE THIS TEST BECAUSE I WANT TO STAY WITH MY BABY. WHAT IS THAT THAT LOOKED LIKE AND SO ANY TIME YOU SPENT MONTHS AND MONTHS WORKING WITH A FAMILY AND GUIDING THEM THROUGH PLANNING THEIR LABOR AND DELIVERY AND THE POSTPARTUM BONDING TO SEE THAT BE SNATCHED AWAY M. IT'S HEARTBREAKING WHEN THERE ISN'T A RECOURSE AND FOR ME NOT BEING ABLE TO BE WITH THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT. S. S. OR OR RESPONSE IN REAL TIME TO HAVE TO ADJUST TO BURCHELL SUPPORT I MEAN HOW HARD IS IT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY THROUGH A MASK RIGHT SO YOU'RE TALKING THROUGH THE MASCULINE MATCHING AMASSED WE'RE TRYING TO DO BREATHING TECHNIQUES I CAN'T SEE HER FACE FULLY I CERTAINLY CAN'T SEE HER FACE FULLY THROUGH A MASK AM ON FACETIME. ON VIDEO RIGHT SO THERE'S ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW LIKE SOMEBODY AT. THE TOP DECIDING WHAT STATE. AND YOU COMPARE THAT TO SOME. WHO DOWN HERE IN IT IN THE TRENCHES WHAT IS. IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN THERE'S NOT THAT FLEXIBILITY M. IT IT IT CAN BE CATASTROPHIC TO A FAMILY THAT MAY BE. RADULA ALREADY. AND WE'RE COMING INTO A SITUATION AND YOU'VE GOT A MOM WHO'S ALREADY AFRAID TO HAVE A BABY IN A PANDEMIC IN A HOSPITAL IN BLACK SKIN. AND THEN SHE HAS TO TELL HER BABY'S FATHER HE CAN'T BE THERE SHE HAS TO TELL HER MOTHER SHE CAN'T BE THERE FOR HER BEST FRIEND OR HURDLE THAT LIKE. ALL OF THESE THINGS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN BREATHING ON HER THE ENTIRE TIME. SO THERE'S NOT THIS HUGE INCREASED RISK OF HAVING THEM BE BY HER. STILL AGAIN RIGHT LIKE NOTHING HAS CHANGED WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT. FOR ALL OF THE GOOD INTENTION THAT THERE ARE FOR THE GUIDELINES- AND THEY MAKE SENSE BIG PICTURE THEY REALLY REALLY DO I DON'T WANT TO BE ON A BUS WITH ANYBODY WITHOUT A MASK I DON'T WANT TO BE ON A PLANE WITH ANYBODY WITHOUT A MASK AND VACCINES AND ALL THAT THAT MAKES SENSE BUT IN OUR LITTLE SMALL CIRCLE FAMILY. BUBBLES OF BIRTH. THERE HAS TO BE THAT BAD LIKE STABILITY AND I HARD PART OF THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE'VE GOT ALL THE STATISTICS FOR THE PART THAT COMES WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT A QUESTION WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE STATISTICS SO FAR OF HOW THIS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTS PEOPLE AND IMPACTS PEOPLE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IS THE MAGNIFYING. THAT A PANDEMIC HAS PLACED ON BIASES. THE INCREASE THE ENERGY THE POWER THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN WHERE. AN INDIVIDUAL'S BIAS CAN TAKE AWAY AN ENTIRE BIRTH PLAN AND THERE'S NO RECOURSE AND WHEN THERE IS A LACK OF. SHARED% VALUES FROM THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP WHO WON ALL THE BEST FOR EVERYBODY AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE HANDS ON CARE- THAT CAUSES DRAMATIC BIRTH EXPERIENCES. FOR WORKING FAMILIES I. HAD. ANDERSON MINISTRY- WALK INTO A ROOM. WITH ANOTHER ADMINISTRATOR WHO WAS NOT A CARE PROVIDER JUST SOMEBODY WHO WAS PURELY ADMINISTRATION BE BROUGHT INTO A ROOM WHEN A FATHER REQUESTED TO AT. ASK QUESTIONS AND THEN FILE AT A REPORT OR A GRIEVANCE WHEN THE FAMILIES BIRTH PLAN WAS NOT FILED. AND EIGHT. THAT POLICY THAT POPPED UP ALL OF A SUDDEN. I'D SAY THAT WASN'T LEGITIMATE BUT IT ONLY CAME UP AFTER THE BABY WAS BORN WAS THAT THEY DISCARDED ME THE DILEMMA FROM THE BIRTH UNTIL THEY SAID THEY SAID THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR MONTHS CO THAT TEST TO COME BACK. I HAD BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL REPEATEDLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT HAVE NEVER COME UP IT DIDN'T COME UP UNTIL AFTER HE SAID. WHY WASN'T HARD LEFT ABLE TO COME IN AND BE WITH US FIRST TIME COUPLE FIRST TIME PARENTS ALL OF THIS HE WAS NEVER ANYTHING OTHER THAN. BUSINESS WHO CAN I TALK TO. ADOLESCENT MINISTRY TO CAYMAN. AND SHE STARTED TOUCHING MY CLIENTS FACE RUBBING HER FACE AND SHE WAS LIKE HOME WE'VE TAKEN SUCH GOOD CARE OF YOU HAVE AT LEAST YOU HAVE SUCH A GOOD EXPERIENCE HERE BUT- I'M FEELING THREATENED AND I'VE ALREADY CALLED SECURITY AND SO. IF HE KEEPS GOING THEN I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO M. AND LITERALLY THIS MOM WHO STILL DRIPPING FROM BIRTHING HER SON. IS HAVING TO HAVE HER ONE ADVOCATE THAT COULD BE THEY'RE- NOT DO HIS JOB. AND IT WAS THE MOST. SICKENING THING THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. M. AND THOSE ARE THE REAL STORIES ANOTHER MOM SINGLE MOM DOING WHAT YOU SUPPOSED TO DO SHOWING UP FOR AN EMERGENCY ULTRASOUND BECAUSE SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT IN THIS PREGNANCY AND WHEN SHE GETS TO THE PLACE THEY TURNED AWAY BECAUSE OF COLLUDED PROTOCOLS SHE CAN'T GO ON WITH THEIR KIDS. SO SHE STANDING OUTSIDE AND WE'RE CALLING EVERYBODY UNDER THE SUN TRYING TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO CAN GET TO HER WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES DURING PEAK HOUR TRAFFIC SO THAT SHE CAN GO IN AND GET HER TESTING DONE WE FOUND SOMEBODY THIS PERSON STATE OUT STOOD OUTSIDE WITH HER CHILDREN SHE GOES IN FROM THAT EXAM THEY SENT HER TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. CAN YOU IMAGINE. IF SHE HADN'T HAD THIS EXTENDED COMMUNITY TO TRY TO FIND SOMEBODY TO BE WITH HER KIDS AND THE REALITY IS. A LOT OF MAMAS. HAVE KIT. AND A LOT OF APPOINTMENTS ARE MISSED BECAUSE FOR. THE POLICIES. DON'T MAKE PROVISION FOR THAT AND STILL. I. I KNOW THAT EVERY STORY IS DIFFERENT. I KNOW THAT EVERY BODY HAS THEIR THEIR VALUES AND THEIR EXPERIENCES AND THEY'RE ALL. EQUALLY VALID. BUT IF OUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE WE HAVE TO START THERE WE HAVE TO START WITH WITH THOSE EXPERIENCES AND THOSE VOICES BEING PRIORITIES WE HAVE TO START WITH. FILTERING WHETHER THE NEW THINGS THAT COME OUT TO DO WORK FOR THOSE FAMILIES AND IF THEY DON'T WE'VE GOT TO DO A DEAD STOP AND FIX IT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD AND THAT WOULD BE MY ASK AND IF YOU EVER WANT A SECOND SET OF BLACK THAT A HUNDRED LIVES AND PUT MY NUMBER IN THE CHAT LIKE FOLLOW ME. I'M. HERE I'M AVAILABLE AND- I'M WILLING. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF A STRATEGY FOR. SCHERING NOW IT HAS IT WAS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND I THINK WHAT IT REALLY RAISES IS THAT TO YOUR POINT THAT YOU MADE THAT THERE. THE POLICIES WHICH ARE THERE TO PROTECT LIVES IN IN MANY CONTEXTS MAKES SENSE ON AN AIRPLANE IN A BUS- I THINK WHAT YOU ARE HIGHLIGHTING AND WHEN NEEDS TO NEVER BE FORGOTTEN IS THAT IF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS PROTECT THE LIVES AND WELLBEING. OF THESE VULNERABLE PEOPLE HE'S COVERED POLICY YOU'RE DOING EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW THE DATA BEARS OUT AND THE STORIES CARE OUT THE YOU BEING IN THE RUMORED TO LIVING IN THURMOND ADVOCATING OR- DECREASES THE RISK. OF MORTALITY FOR WOMEN OF COLOR AND SO IF WE ARE HERE TO PROTECT THEIR LIVES THAT HAS TO BE A PART OF THE CALCULATION. AND THE SAFETY OF THOSE CHILDREN THERE WERE STANDING UTSIDE THE CLINIC AND YOU KNOW THE SAFETY GOES BEYOND JUST THAT OF KOBE NINETEEN AND IT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE TOP OF MIND AND HAS TAKEN. MORE LIVES THAN ANY OF US WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW AS WE HEARD FROM MR- I KIA SERVICE CHILDBIRTH. RIGHT AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BALANCING ALL THE NEEDS AND THE VOICES YOU BRING TO THIS CONVERSATION ARE REALLY CRITICAL SO THANK YOU- I KNOW THAT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION FOR US- OF HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT- BRINGING PEOPLE THROUGH WHAT IS. SHOULD BE THE MOST INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR LIVES BUT ISN'T ALWAYS THAT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. WE GET THERE- READ. THE RISKS AND INCREASING THE JOY IN THOSE MOMENTS SO. THANK YOU FOR BEING DOING THE WORK EVERY DAY BEING IN THE TRENCHES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE PARTNERSHIPS AND HOW WE AS- LAWMAKERS AND POLICYMAKERS CAN SUPPORT THE WORK YOU DO. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU- AND WE ARE. OVER TIME BECAUSE THAT CONVERSATION WAS SO GOOD SO I'M GOING TO. STICK AND ALL THANK YOU ALL- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON A PANEL THREE WHICH WILL BE FOCUSED ON DOMESTIC AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE. AND- WE PROBABLY WILL GO OVER BY ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING THE CLOCK AND- SO WE REALLY WANTED TO WORK THIS INTO OUR PANEL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- IS PARTICULARLY. PACKED FULL ON. AND WOMEN IN WOMEN DURING THEIR REPRODUCTIVE YEARS MATERNAL HEALTH THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA AND WE KNOW THAT. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS UNDER RESOURCED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND THE STRESSES THE FINANCIAL STRAINS AND HOUSING INSECURITY OF THIS PANDEMIC ONLY COMPLICATED THE ISSUE AND EXACERBATED AT. SO TODAY WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM EXPERTS AND ADVOCATES WORKING WITH SURVIVORS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE PANDEMIC IMPACTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WHAT POLICY RESPONSES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT SURVIVORS ARE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED GOING FORWARD. SO ON THIS PANEL WE HAVE NO THE L. MORRIS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MY SISTER'S HOUSE RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO ALISON MESSENGER MANAGING STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE GENESSEE CENTER AND KRISTA COLOGNE PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND SO WE WILL START AGAIN WITH THE INTRODUCTIONS- IN TELLING US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR WORK AND HOW THE WORK IS GENERALLY CHANGE DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND WE WILL OPEN WITH NO THAT. THANK YOU- MY NAME IS NOT ABOUT MARS AND I'VE BEEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MY SISTER'S HOUSE FOR THE PAST SEVENTEEN YEARS. AS YOU SHARED Y SISTER'S HOUSE IS A NONPROFIT BASED IN SACRAMENTO PROVIDING SHELTER AND SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WHAT MAKES OUR ORGANIZATION SPECIAL AND UNIQUE ARE TWO TRAITS ONE OUR CULTURAL RESPONSIVE EXPERTISE DEALING WITH ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER VICTIMS. AND TO OUR EXPERTISE IS THE ONLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER IN CALIFORNIA PERHAPS IN THE NATION. THAT OPERATES A CAFE WHICH PROVIDES JOB TRAINING AND INCOME FOR OUR SURVIVORS. AND RECENTLY WE OPENED UP A GIVE STARTER STORE WE HAVE A STAFF OF TWENTY OF WHICH SOME ARE SURVIVORS RECEIVING JOB TRAINING SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE. IN ADDITION TO BEING A MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MY SISTER'S HOUSE IS ALSO A MEMBER AND FOUNDER OF THE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NETWORK. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE ARTY BEGAN WHICH IS A COLLABORATION OF SEVENTEEN ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA REFLECTING. ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LATIN NEXT BLACKED EXACTLY CHALLENGED AND L. G. B. T. Q. I. H. MOVIES WHICH IS BEEN SUPPORTED. WITH BLUE SHIELD FOUNDATION. OUR CULTURE IS ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENCE BUT WE- THAT TO. A GENDER BASED FILE IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO BUILD AND STRENGTHEN OUR CULTURE RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH FOCUS ON OUR UNDERSERVED IN CHALLENGE COMMUNITIES. COVERT NINETEEN IS DRAMATIZED THE WEAKNESSES OF LAWS ALREADY IN OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SYSTEM. TO MORE EFFECTIVELY SERVE CALIFORNIANS VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I URGE THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND ITS MEMBERS TO TAKE ACTIONS TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING. INSURE THAT WHEN YOU CREATE FUNDED PROGRAMS THAT THERE IS A FUNDING SET ASIDE FOR THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN DEALING WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL ISSUES. AND SECOND TO ENSURE THAT ALL EXISTING FUNDING PROGRAMS UNDER YOUR PURVIEW MAKE MEASURABLE PROGRESS TOWARDS SERVING ALL OF THEIR COMMUNITY- AND I. WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS LATER THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER THOMAS NOW WILL TURN IT OVER TO MISS MESSENGER INTERACTION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ALLISON MESSENGER AND I HAD THE DISTINCT PLEASURE BEING THE MANAGING STAFF ATTORNEY AT GENESEE CENTER. JEALOUSY CENTER IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAM BASED IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES OUR SERVICE AREA IS A SERVICE POPULATION AREA SIX L. A. COUNTY. SENATE THE CENTER WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE FIVE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WHO ARE SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WE DO APPROACH TO WORK WITH THE CULTURALLY SPECIFIC LANDS. TOWARDS BLACK AND AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. JENNY THE CENTER STARTED VERY VERY GRASS ROOTS WITH JUST A HOTLINE THAT OFFERED THINGS LIKE FOOD BASKET. DIAPERS BABY FORMULA AND CLOSE TO WOMEN AND VIOLENCE. QUICKLY THE NEED FOR SHELTER WAS RECOGNIZED WE OPENED OUR FIRST EMERGENCY SHELTER THREE YEARS AFTER WE WERE FOUND IT. AND FROM THESE VERY VERY HUMBLE BEGINNINGS CHEN IS THE CENTER HAS GROWN TO BECOME A NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PROGRAM. CURRENTLY WE OFFER EMERGENCY AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS AS WELL AS A HOST OF COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES INCLUDING CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS DIRECTLY GO SERVICES. AND CASE MANAGEMENT WHICH ARE PROBABLY ALREADY SAID- AND MANY MANY OTHER SERVICES INCLUDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. OUR WORK HAS CHANGED QUITE DRASTICALLY IN THE WAKE OF COBIT MOST NOTICEABLY IT IS CHANGED IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SHELTER FAMILIES IN NEED OF EMERGENCY HOUSING. MOST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER PROGRAMS OPERATE ON THE COMMUNAL HOUSING MODEL. BUT AS SOON AS THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS WERE IMPOSED WE RECOGNIZE THAT COMMUNAL LIVING NO LONGER FELT SAFE. OR CLIENTS OR FOR OUR STAFF. AND IN THE INITIAL DAYS OF TE PANDEMIC WE WERE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH OUR LOCAL CITY GOVERNMENTS IN A PROGRAM CALLED. PROJECT SAFE HAVEN WHICH ALLOWED US TO HOUSE FAMILIES IN A HOTEL. WE WERE ALLOCATED NINETY HOTEL ROOMS AND IN THE NINE MONTHS PROJECT SAFE HAVEN WAS OPERATIONAL. OUR OUR ROOMS WERE NEVER VACANT TO GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT OF HOW COLD IT AFFECTED THE NEED FOR SHELTER ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT MANY OTHER ESCAPE ROUTES SUCH AS STAYING WITH FAMILY FRIENDS OBTAINING A RESTRAINING ORDER OR EVEN JUST GOING TO THE POLICE AND ASKING FOR HELP WERE IMPACTED BY. THE PANDEMIC THE NEED FOR SHELTER GREATLY EXPANDED. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN HOUSED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN NEW FAMILIES WHO WERE IN NEED OF EMERGENCY SHELTER. IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT NUMBER EXPLODED. TWO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE WHICH REPRESENTS. 86% INCREASE. NOW SINCE FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS LIKE PROJECTS STATE CAPE AND HAVE GONE AWAY AND WE ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE QUANTITY OF HOTEL ROOMS THAT WE HAD DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC TO DATE WE HAVE HOUSE A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE FAMILIES IN OUR LAREST SHELTERS WHICH REPRESENTS A 63% DECREASE FROM TWENTY TWENTY AND 31% DECREASE FROM TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. SO FOR US THIS OBVIOUSLY RAISES CONCERNS THAT WE ARE NOT SERVING THE NEEDS OF. VICTIMS WHO ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF EMERGENCY SHELTER AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE URGENTLY ASK ON THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS TO CREATE FUNDING THAT IS NOT TIED TO METRICS THAT NO LONGER MAKES SENSE IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC SUCH AS BAD NIGHTS. WERE HEAD COUNTS ST BINDING THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE AND HOW WE HOUSING INDIVIDUALS IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF EMERGENCY SHELTER. AND WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY OPENING REMARKS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATH MATH CENTER AND NOW- MISS COLOGNE WHO IS NO STRANGER HERE IN THE CAPITAL OF TURNED OVER TO YOU TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHAT ACTUALLY LEVY TO GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF LEVELLAND PRIOR TO PANDEMIC AND HOW IT CHANGED DURING THE PAST. THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THOUGHT MY NAME IS. KRISTA COLOGNE AND THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE ARE THE STATEWIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORGANIZATION. AND THAT MEANS THAT I HAVE THE TREMENDOUS PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH FOLKS LIKE ALLISON AND NELDA AND THEIR COLLEAGUES ALL ACROSS THE STATE EVERY DAY. OUR ROLE AS AN ORGANIZATION BROADLY SPEAKING INSISTS. HELP BRING THE ISSUES IMPACTING THE SURVIVORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO THE CAPITAL. TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO LOCAL PROGRAMS TO HELP THEM TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE SERVICES. UNTIL BEYONCE PROFESSION PREVENTION AFTER. WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT INEVITABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO A LOT OF OUR WORK IS FOCUSED ON. HOW WE CAN SUPPORT AND. FURTHER ATTENTION. BUT A START WITH YOUR A BIT OF A LOOKED IN CALIFORNIA PANDEMIC AND WHAT WE SEE YES- IN TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONDED TO OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALL. IN A CITY NEAR NEARLY 9% OF ALL MUSLIMS IN THE STATE WERE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED WITH THE NINETY INDIVIDUALS LOSING THEIR LIVES. SIXTY EIGHT OF WERE THAT PEOPLE TWENTY TWO ROOM. AND FIVE OF THOSE WHO WEREKILLED THE NIGHT YEAR RICH CHILDREN- INCLUDING MARTIN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF SERVICE AND- IN FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. HUNDRED INTO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER PROGRAMS HERE IN THE STATE. ANSWERED ALMOST EIGHTY THOUSAND HOTLINE CALLS. PROVIDED NEARLY NINETEEN THOUSAND SURVIVORS AND CHILDREN WITH EMERGENCY. SHELTER TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND. TO PUT THOSE RATHER STAGGERING NUMBERS PER YEAR AND CISCO I'M JUST ONE DAY IN. TWENTY NINETEEN FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SURVIVORS AND CHILDREN WERE SICKENED BY DOMESTIC OUT. OF INCLUDING THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVEN ADULT AND CHILD VICTIMS WHO CONCEIVED HOUSING SERVICES. ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN RECEIVED NOT RESIDENTIAL SERVICES THAT INCLUDE COUNSELING LEGAL ADVOCACY CHILDREN'S GROUPS AND MUCH MORE. DESPITE ALL OF THAT WORK ALL OF THE NEED THAT WAS IN THAT IN THAT ONE DAY THAT SAME DAY. OVER TWELVE HUNDRED REQUESTS FOR SERVICES WENT UNMET DUE TO THE LACK OF RESEARCH THAN OF WHICH ABOUT 51% OR SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY REFER HOUSING AND EMERGENCY SHELTER. AND THAT'S WHAT THE SITUATION WAS BEFORE THAT HAPPENS. WHEN CO THAT HAPPENED AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ALISON AND BUILD THE RESTRICTIVE PROGRAMS HAVE HAD TO ADAPT DRAMATICALLY. INTO HOW THEY RESPOND. I WHAT WE KNOW THAT THE NEED FOR. THAT CHU. RESEARCH BEEN- A MERGING OF THAT UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY ABOUT INCREASED RATES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE HEARD FROM PROGRAMS ABOUT HOW LINE'S RINGING OFF THE HOOK. AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD A CHANCE THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT THE NAME. ARTICULAR AS WE HOPEFULLY WE SEE SOME LIGHT AT THE END OF A COLD AND TUMBLE. WHICH IS THE- MANY TIMES WHEN WE WOULD SEE DEATHS IN CASE FRIDAY WHEN RESTRICTIONS WOULD START TO. BE REDUCED RENDON PEOPLE FELT MORE COMFORTABLE BEING OUT IN SOCIETY. THAT'S ONE PROGRAMS SAW A LARGE SPIKES IN THE RATE OF SURVIVORS FILE THAT THERE WOULD SAFETY AND BEING ABLE TO THINK ABOUT LEAVING THEIR HOME CHÁVEZ AN UNSAFE SITUATION BANKING ABOUT REACHING OUT FOR HELP. THOSE INCREASES A MERGED EVEN US COPE AND DECLINING AND OF COURSE THE THIS PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN ABSENT CLOSE. WE KNOW THE HAD NO POINT HAS IT EVER BEEN SLOWER QUIET OR PROGRAM. AND I WILL JUST LEAVE IT BUT THE OTHER TEAMS THAT IT. TO BE MINDFUL OF AS CO THAT HAS INVOLVED IS THAT THE WAY PROGRAMS MEET THE NEEDS SURVIVORS OF THE BALL. ALISON SPOKE ABOUT OXYGEN TO THEIR HOUSING PROGRAMS ALSO ADAPTATIONS TO HOW WE SUPPORT SURVIVORS AND NAVIGATING THE COURT SYSTEM HOW ARE COURTS ARE EVEN OPEN OR ACCEPTING REQUESTS FOR RESTRAINING ORDERS. BACKLOGS AND HEARING THOSE. ALL SORTS OF CORD. WE'VE SEEN A RISE IN USE OF TELEHEALTH OR REMOTE YOU KNOW IN ZOOM BASED OR OTHER MORE SECURE- VIDEO AND VIRTUAL PLATFORMS TO PROVIDE COUNSELING AND PEER SUPPORT GROUPS- BOTH WITH VERY POSITIVE RESULTS AND WE THINK ABOUT COMMUNITY IS WHERE TRANSPORTATION CAN BE A REAL BARRIER RIGHT THIS HAS REDUCED TRANSPORTATION CAN CHALLENGES. AND ALSO WE IS AND WHICH THIS IS THAN A LESS THAN IDEAL SITUATION TECHNOLOGY ISN'T PERFECT AS WE ALL KNOW THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN OUR COMMUNITY IS VERY REAL AND CERTAINLY NOT EVERY SURVIVOR HAS ACCESS TO THOSE SAFETY AND PRIVACY IN THEIR OWN HOME TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE TYPES OF SEARCH ENGINE IN. THE- IN TERMS OF WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE NOW I THINK IN SOME WAYS THE CONSTANT AND OTHER PROGRAMS HAVE NEVER CLOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE NEVER STOPPED ME THIS NEED AND THE NEED CONTINUES TO BE. A MORE INTENSE. THE CHALLENGES IN HELPING SURVIVOR NAVIGATE TO SAFETY REAL. AND I'LL HAVE TURN HAVE TO KNOW THAT ISLANDS AND TO SHARE MORE ABOUT THOSE IN. THANK YOU MESCALERO NINE I. OUR YOU SPOKE A THE NEED FOR US TO FIND HOUSING IN A FLEXIBLE WAY- BUT I'M WONDERING IF EITHER OF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS MISS COLLINS- POINT ABOUT WHAT OTHER NEEDS YOU LIKE US TO THE LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS ON MOVING FORWARD. AND I GUESS ARGUE NOW THAT HE'S LIKE. IT THANK YOU I'VE I THINK THAT'S IF THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS RACISM I KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT BUT THAT THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL RACISM ESPECIALLY THAT OUR CLIENTS HAVE SEEN DURING THIS. AND DEMOCRATS- SOME OF IT IS ALSO A AND IT INTERACTED WITH HOUSING. FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A- ONE OF OUR SISTER ORGANIZATIONS IN LA- DATA CREATING CLIENT AND WHO BETTER TO RENT A PLACE- BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO LEAVE HER ABUSER SO SHE HAD THE FUNDS HER RENTAL BACKGROUND WAS FINE SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD THE LEASE. UNTIL THE COMPLEX THOUGHT SHE WOULD SPREAD CODED BECAUSE SHE WAS ASIAN. SO NOT HAVING STATE HOUSING DEFINITELY AFFECTS ONE'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OF OUR EVEN AS A GUY THAT AFFECTED HAVE A DOUBLE FEAR WALKING OUT THE DOOR AND GETTING COLDER. BUT WITH THE SECOND. PROBLEM BEING BEING BLAMED FOR KOBE AND HAVING TO DEAL WITH RACISM. HI AND IT ISN'T ENOUGH THAT THERE IS THAT REALITY OF THE FEAR INCOMPETENT THE COVERED RACISM. THIS IS ALSO BEEN- AWAY OF ABUSE BY THEIR THEIR ABUSERS- WE'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL VICTIMS TELLING US HOW THEIR ABUSERS TELL THEM. YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET COOPER THEY'RE GOING TO SPREAD COLD WINTER GONNA FACE RACISM AND SO IT JUST MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER FOR THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES TO CALL FOR HELP. AND WE'VE ALSO KNOWN THAT THERE'S BEEN AN IMPACT ESPECIALLY ON THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY. IT BAG COMMUNITIES SUFFERED THE MOST ECONOMICALLY BECAUSE I'VE CALLED A COUPLE FEARS AND RACISM. THIS IS MEANT A LOSS OF JOBS IN OUR- ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES STRESS ADDITIONAL STRESS ON OUR API FAMILIES AND WE BELIEVE MORE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN IN OUR HOMES. THE VIRUS DIDN'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY TOUCH OUR FAMILIES BUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT FROM THE VERIFIERS MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN OUR FAMILIES. SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING LEGISLATIVE THAT YOU COULD HELP WITH THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT IMPACTED BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY REVEALED WHEN FOLKS RETURNED TO WORKING OUTSIDE THEIR HOMES MORE. AND THAT'S WHEN I CRISIS CALLS WHICH ONES ARE GOING TO SPIKE MARC AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN PLACE AND A STRONGER POSITION. TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SERVICE. THANK YOU MISS THOMAS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW THAT- WE HAVE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON THE RISE SPECIFICALLY IN ASIAN HATE DURING THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC IT'S SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW WE- I AM A MEMBER OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS AND WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED WE FOCUS AT ALL TIMES ON THE RISE IN HATE CRIMES THAT AFFECTS OUR COMMUNITY BUT IT IS BEEN- DISTINCT. HONOR TO PARTNER WITH THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CAUCUS TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE. THE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA AND WE DID PASS QUITE A FEW PIECES OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT WE HOPE WILL HELP WITH THE REPORTING AND TRACKING THOSE HATE CRIMES WE CAN BETTER TARGET THEM BUT IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING AND I'M REALLY GLAD YOU ELEVATED IT. BECAUSE IT DOES TOUCH EVERY ASPECT OF THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE IT ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY AB EXPERIENCING TRAUMA TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THIS MESSENGER ANYTHING YOU WANNA ADD. TO WHAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO MUCH OF WHAT- HILDA HAS ALREADY LIFTED UP WHICH IS THE NEED FOR CULTURALLY SPECIFIC FUNDING- WE ARE WE ARE ONE SUCH GRANT WE RECEIVED IT. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT REALLY. ALLOCATE FUNDING ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CHEN C. CENTER LIKE. MY SISTER'S HOUSE THAT ARE- OPERATING WITH THE CULTURALLY SPECIFIC PLANS AND FOCUS. PRECAMBRIAN MICK- AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WERE. THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WE SUSPECT. THAT THAT STATISTIC- HAS INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND WE KNOW THAT- AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN HAVE PARTICULAR CONCERNS. ABOUT BEING ABLE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP NOT IN TRADITIONAL WAYS. AND OUR ORGANIZATION HAS STOOD AS ONE OF THOSE SAFE HAVENS WHERE. AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES FELT SAFE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP. WHEN THEY WERE EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE FUNDING THAT RECOGNIZES THE SPECIAL ROLE. THAT WE PLAY IN SERVING SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES- I DID TOUCH ON THIS A LITTLE BIT IN MY OPENING REMARKS IN TERMS. OF. LOOKING AT HOW. FINDING IT YOU AND SUCCESS METRICS- SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS ARE FEE FOR SERVICE SO IN OTHER WORDS WE ONLY GET REIMBURSED UNDER THE CONTRACT WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO BILL FOR CERTAIN. SPECIFIC SERVICES SUCH AS BAD NIGHTS AND IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC THESE METRICS NO LONGER MAKES SENSE AND THEY DON'T ACCURATELY REFLECT THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF THE WORK THAT WE ARE DEALING I'M PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC AND SO I BELIEVE LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A LOOK AT PERHAPS. CRAFTING SOME LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DO AWAY WITH THESE- MEASUREMENT MODELS IF YOU WILL THAT WILL HINDER OUR ABILITY. AS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DO THIS WORK AND TO DO THIS WORK IN A WAY THAT IS FLEXIBLE AND RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. AND THAT CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO FUNCTION NO MATTER WHETHER IT'S A PANDEMIC OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT- IMPACTS THE WAY THAT WE DO THE WORK SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I'D ASK LEGISLATORS TO CONSIDER. IF I MIGHT ADD YOU KNOW COBIT NINETEEN IS REALLY DRAMATIZED RESULTS INSTEAD IN EQUITIES IN OUR SYSTEM. AND THERE ARE. COUNTERPARTS AND HAVE BIG FUND RAISING TEENS- BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ABLE AND EFFECTIVE TO SERVE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- INSIDE. I WANT TO ECHO ALISON IS. COMMON IF YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S FUNDING FOR THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE HAVE THAT EXPERTISE ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL ISSUES. AND I WANT TO ECHO TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THAT OTHER PROGRAMS- THAT UTILIZE EXISTING FUNDED PROGRAMS MAKE MEASURABLE PROGRESS TOWARDS SERVING ALL OF THEIR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU BOTH I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT SERVICES TO YOU- THE YOU ALL PROVIDE AND YOUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND ENSURING THAT. WE HAVE CULTURALLY COMPETENT ORGANIZATIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AND- MAKE SURE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE COMFORTABLE RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS A HEART YOUR CLIENTS TO REALLY HARD THING WHEN THEY REACH OUT TO YOU FOR SERVICES. AND SO I KNOW THAT THEY NEED TRUST IN ORDER TO DO THAT AND I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR ORGANIZATIONS HAVE WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD. AND TO EARN THAT TRUST AND TO CONTINUE TO BE A TRUSTED SOURCE TO PROVIDE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SERVICES THAT SAVE A LIFE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND KNOW THAT YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT. TO AND I KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES TO CONTINUE. TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO SUPPORT ALL OF YOU AND SAVING. THE LIVES WHO NEED IT MOST SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANT WORK WE HAVE AHEAD OF US- I THINK THAT THIS HEARING HAS REALLY- IT'S GONNA PUT US TO WORK WITH A LOT TO DO BUT IT'S IMPORTANT WORK AND IMPORTANT WORK FOR. AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. IN THIS WORK. I'M WITH FACTS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANYONE IS CALLING IN. YOU MAY CALL AND THE TOLL FREE NUMBER LISTED ON THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE WHICH IS. 877-692-8957 IN THE ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO ALL COMMENTS AND CAN BE UP TO TWO MINUTES THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO CONTRIBUTE. AND THERE IS NO ONE HERE IN THE ROOM SO WE WILL NOT TAKE ANY COMMENT IN PERSON- BUT IF THE MODERATOR WILL SEE IF ANYONE'S ON THE LINE THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU IF YOU LIKE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME YOUR PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE. AGAIN WE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. WE DO HAVE A FEW LINES THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. IT'S LIKE TO PROCEED TO THE FIRST COMMENT. YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOLDLINE THE ELEVEN ELEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HEY CAN I BE HEARD- IN REPRODUCTIVE COMMITTEES- I INTENDED TO COMMEND PERSON TODAY BUT- GIVEN THAT- I AM JUGGLING- A SICK CHILD AND CHILDREN WITH NO SCHOOL IT'S A LITTLE BIT IRONIC BECAUSE OF THE TOPIC- OF TODAY'S HEARING YEAH AND I THINK BIRD YOU ARE BEING HEARD YOU ARE. ON THE PHONE FROM WORK SOMETIMES PEOPLE CUT OUT SOMETIMES SOME OF BOTH KALRA ISN'T TAKEN AT ALL SO THAT BEING SAID- MY NAME IS ANDREA HAD STRUM AND- TOOK A LOT OF. THINGS I COULD SEE ADDED KNOW WHAT DIRECTION I WOULD TAKE MY COMMENT TODAY- BECAUSE SOME OF THESE ACCOUNTS ARE JUST SO HEARTBREAKING ABOUT THE DOMESTIC- BY ONCE AND- HOW THIS HAS IMPACTED. WOMEN IN PARTICULAR- THE ACCOUNT OF THE- PEOPLE BEING DENIED- ABOUT- EXPERIENCE- BECAUSE OF THESE- STRUCTURES AND LOCKDOWNS AND- IT'S JUST UNFATHOMABLE TO ME SO- AGAIN I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION I WOULD TAKE MY COMMENT BUT- I FEEL COMPELLED TO SAY- BY STARTING OUT I AM VERY PRO CHOICE. AND I CONSIDER ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES TO BE PARAMOUNT TO MY OWN VALUE SYSTEM AS A MARK OF A JUST SOCIETY I PERSONALLY HAVE WORKED IN THE MATERNAL CARE INDUSTRY AS A BIRTH DOULA AND FREESTANDING BIRTH CENTER. AND OF THE PRE AND POST NATAL YOGA TEACHER- ADDITIONALLY I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN SERVED BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN FIVE DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND I HAVE AN UNWAVERING CONVICTION THAT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE INCLUDING ACCESS TO ABORTION SERVICES IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN PREGNANT NINE TIMES. I HAVE FOUR LIVING CHILDREN AND I HAVE HAD TWO ABORTIONS WHICH IS TO SAY I HAVE ELECTED TO TERMINATE TWO PREGNANCIES. I CHOSE ABORTION BECAUSE OF MY OWN CONVICTION NOT BODILY SOVEREIGNTY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND BODILY SOVEREIGNTY IS FOUNDATIONAL TO WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE CARE AND ABORTION. A WOMAN RIGHT TO ABSOLUTELY. OVER HER BODY IS ALSO REFLECTED IN CALIFORNIA CODE TWO FOUR ONE SEVEN ONE. RIGHT FOR ME TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO MY OWN BODY. THE LAW SAYS THAT I MAY NOT BE COERCED INTO DOING ANYTHING AGAINST MY WISHES. PLEASE HOLD WHILE THE HOUSE MUNOZ RUNS THE NATION IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE AND ABORTION SERVICES IT IS PERPLEXING TO ME THAT CALIFORNIA'S ALSO LEADING THE WAY IN TERMS OF VACCINE MANDATES. WHERE VACCINES ARE CONCERNED CURRENTLY DEMOCRATS IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT SEEM TO CARE ABOUT THEIR OWN SUPPOSED VALUES BECAUSE MY BODY MY CHOICE APPARENTLY DOES NOT APPLY TO VACCINES I FIND THIS IS CONNECTED TO BE INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST. HYPOCRITICAL AND VERY LOW OF SOME IT IS NO WONDER THAT YOU MIGHT LIVESTRONG CONCEIVE WILL NEED TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PERSON AFTER TWO MINUTES SO WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY. TO HEAR ALL PUBLIC COMMENT.
