PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM PART I'VE DYSKINESIA OFTEN SUFFER EMBARRASSMENT LEADING TO FEELINGS OF ISOLATION WITHDRAWAL AND- LACK OF FAMILY PARTICIPATION.

YOU SEEN ON AUGUST THIRTY THREE. NO ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS RUN OUR FINAL ITEM FILE ITEM EIGHTY TWO. BY SENATOR CAFIERO SHE IS PREPARED SECRETARY MEMORY. SENATE BILL ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE BY SENATOR CABALLERO AN ACT RELATING TO HEAR SAY SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WHICH WOULD ALLOW AND NARAL HEARSAY EXCEPTION FOR THE STATEMENT OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM. MADE TO A MEDICAL PROVIDER FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT TO BE ADMITTED AT TRIAL. VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND UNFORTUNATELY CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST THEM ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE BECAUSE THERE ARE FEW WITNESSES. AND MOST OF THE ABUSE OCCURS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ENORMOUS PRESSURE IS PUT ON VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FREQUENTLY FROM TEIR ABUSERS OR FAMILIES TO DENY THE ABUSE AT THE INDOOR. IN MANY INSTANCES A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL THAT SEES THE VICTIM RIGHT AFTER THE INJURY OR THE ABUSE IS THE ONLY PERSON TO WHOM A VICTIM DISCLOSES THE MANNER AND EXTENT OF THE ABUSE AND INJURY. OUR LAWS RIGHT POLICE SHIELD VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO REFUSED TO TESTIFY FROM PENAL CONSEQUENCES THEY CANNOT BE INCARCERATED FOR REFUSING TO TESTIFY. REFUSING TO TESTIFY IS NOT HOWEVER INDICATIVE OF A DESIRE TO BE LEFT UNPROTECTED AND SO WE PROSECUTE OFFENDERS WITHOUT FORCING VICTIMS TO TESTIFY WHERE THEY MAY PUT THEMSELVES IN GREATER DANGER FOR ABUSE OR ISOLATION. IN THESE-INSTANCES WHERE VICTIMS CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WOULD ALLOW VICTIMS TRUTHS TO BE HEARD. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A HEARSAY EXCEPTION FOR STATEMENTS MADE BY A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM TO A MEDICAL CARE PROVIDER FOR PURPOSES OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. AND FOR STATEMENT REASONABLY PERTINENT TO MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT- A LOT THE FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE PERMITS THE STATEMENTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS GIVEN TO A MEDICAL CARE PROVIDER FOR PURPOSES OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS. OR TREATMENT TO BE ADMISSIBLE AT TRIAL REGARDLESS OF THE VICTIM'S AVAILABILITY. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WOULD CONFORM CALIFORNIA'S RULES PROTECTING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO FEDERAL LAW. AND EVEN BROADER MEDICAL HEARSAY EXCEPTION IS ALLOWED IN ILLINOIS MINNESOTA NORTH CAROLINA OREGON AND RHODE ISLAND. CALIFORNIA ALSO ALREADY OFFERS THIS HEARSAY EXCEPTION FOR CASES OF CHILD ABUSE UNDER CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF BOTH THE PUBLIC THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEES I'VE ADDED ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS. ONE THE BILL IS LIMITED TO USE IN CRIMINAL CASES ONLY TO THE STATEMENTS MADE MAY ONLY BE USED WITH THE VICTIM'S CONSENT AND THREE. THE NOTICE MUST BE PROVIDED TO THE DEFENDANT AND COUNSEL AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS BEFORE ITS USE. MEDICAL HERE SAY IS A CRITICAL AND EFFECTIVE TOOL TO COUNTERACT AN ABUSER'S MANIPULATIONS AND THREATS THAT PERFECT. PREVENT VICTIM TESTIMONY. CONSISTENT AND EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION OF DOMESTIC ABUSE HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF DECREASING THE INCIDENCE OF DOMESTIC DOMESTIC ABUSE. BUT EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION REQUIRES COMPELLING EVIDENCE. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE ALLOWS THE EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES WHERE THERE IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE BECAUSE THE VICTIM HAS SOUGHT MEDICAL CARE AND TREATMENT FOR THEIR INJURIES. THIS WILL PROTECT THE VICTIM FROM FURTHER BROUGH ABUSE AND HONOR THE VICTIMS RIGHT NOT TO TESTIFY THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.

YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT WITH DEEP SADNESS THAT ARISE IN S. SENATE TO JOURNEY MEMORY OF NORMAN Y. MINETA. I WAS HONORED TO CALL SECRETARY MINETA FRIEND AND MENTOR- I FIRST MET MR MINETA WHEN I WAS A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES- WHEN HE JOINED MY FATHER TO HAND OUT FREE WHOLE WHEAT PUMPKINS TO KIDS IN THE SAN JOSE. HE WAS BORN IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE IN OUR HOMETOWN OF SAN JOSE. HE WAS SENT WITH HIS FAMILY TO AN INTERNMENT CAMP IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO AT THE AGE OF TEN. WHILE WEARING HIS BOY SCOUT UNIFORMS. THE ONLY POSSESSION HE CARRIED AT THE TIME WAS IS BASEBALL BAT. HIS LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL BAT. WHICH WAS CONFISCATED AT HEART MOUNTAIN FOR FEAR IT WOULD BE USED AS A WEAPON. THE OFFICE SAID THE MOST HURTFUL THING THAT HE COULD NEVER FORGET. WAS BEING REFERRED TO AS A NON ALIEN. HE TOLD THE TOLD THE STORY OF ASKING HIS BROTHER WHAT THAT MEANT. IN Y. GIVEN HIS NATURAL BIRTHRIGHT HE WASN'T SIMPLY REFERRED TO AS A CITIZEN. IT WAS A HEART MOUNTAIN THAT HE MET ALAN K. SIMPSON. IN IN THE TWIST OF FATE ELLEN SIMPSON HIMSELF A BOY SCOUT. FROM MARK WYOMING WHO HAD BEEN VISITING HEART MOUNTAIN. BECAME A UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN SERVING SIDE BY SIDE WITH NORM IN CONGRESS. THOSE TWO BECAME FRIENDS FOR LIFE IN FACT BEST FRIENDS. HE WAS A TRAILBLAZING LEADER THAT BROKE BARRIERS FOR ASIAN AMERICANS SECRETARY MINETA WAS THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN FIRST PERSON OF COLOR TO SERVE ON THE SAN JOSE CITY COUNCIL. IT'S WORTH NOTING AND I KNOW THIS FIRSTHAND. THAT ON THE TOPIC OF AP I HATE. DURING NORMS FOR CITY COUNCIL CAMPAIGN HE WAS ADVISED NOT TO USE HIS PHOTO. IN ANY OF HIS CAMPAIGN MATERIALS FOR FEAR THAT HE'D LOSE ANTI ASIAN VOTES. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID. LATER HE WAS ELECTED THE MAYOR OF SAN JOSE BECAME THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN TO LEAD A MAJOR CITY IN THE UNITED STATES. MINISTERED IN CONGRESS FOR TWENTY YEARS. WHERE HE LED THE PASSAGE. WITH THE HELP OF HIS BOYHOOD FRIEND ALAN SIMPSON SIMPSON OF THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT A FEDERAL LAW THAT PROVIDED REPARATIONS AND APOLOGY TO JAPANESE AMERICANS INTO INTERNMENT CAMPS DURING WORLD WAR TWO. IN TWO THOUSAND HE BECAME THE FIRST. ASIAN AMERICAN TO SERVE AS US SECRETARY OF COMMERCE. UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON AND THEN WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH AS U. S. SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION. MOST OF US KNOW THAT ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ONE. IT WAS SECRETARY MINETA. WHERE TO TAKE CHARGE OF ALL FHA ACTIVITIES. GROUNDED ALL AIRCRAFT. ULTIMATELY CREATED WHAT WE NOW KNOW AS THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY AGENCY OR TSA AND HOMELAND SECURITY. I WAS IN THE CELLS THE CITY HALL BY THAT TIME IN ON THAT MORNING GONZALEZ WALKING INTO MY OFFICE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS I THINK NORM HAS IT ALL UNDER CONTROL AND THAT'S HOW WE ALL FELT. IN THE CITY OF SAN JOSE I'M NOT SURE HOW OTHER CALIFORNIA'S FELT. ON THAT MORNING THAT DAY RELATIVE. TO THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION BUT IN SAN JOSE IT WOULD BE AS GOOD AS HAVING. YOUR FATHER FIGURE. TAKING CHARGE OF YOUR OWN SECURITY AND SAFETY. SECRETARY MINETA EMBODY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PUBLIC SERVANT IT WAS AN INSPIRATION TO COUNTLESS LEADERS INCLUDING MYSELF. LATER. AFTER TWO THOUSAND ONE IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO- GONZALEZ APPROACHED ME. IN ASKED ME. TO HELP WITH THE VOTES ON AN ELEVEN MEMBER COUNCIL TO RENAME SALES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. NORMAN Y. MINETA SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. OF COURSE- I AGREED IMMEDIATELY BUT A SUB SCHOOL WE GOT A CALL. FROM FORMER CONGRESSMAN MIKE HONDA THEN STILL IN CONGRESS. ASKING ME TO PERSONALLY GIVE NORMA CALL. I CALLED SECRETARY MINETA. ANY ASKED ME. TO STOP WITH THE PROCEEDINGS THAT HE WANTED TO PULL THE ITEM OFF THE COUNCIL AGENDA THOSE VIEW- FAMILIAR WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL SERVE IN THOSE OF YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE BROWN ACT KNOW THAT THERE WAS NO WAY FOR HIM TO KNOW OR US TO KNOW PRECISELY WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD BE A MAJORITY VOTE. AND HE SAID BECAUSE OF THAT. IN THAT LACK OF CERTAINTY HE DIDN'T WANT TO RISK EMBARRASSING HIS FAMILY. HIS TWO SONS GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE LIVING IN SAN JOSE AND THEIR FAMILIES SAID IT WASN'T WORTH IT. IT'S NOT WORTH IT MY FAMILY COMES FIRST. A REASSURED HIM. AND TOLD HIM WE HAVE THE VOTES. THAT WASN'T AN EASY VOTE THERE WERE PARTISAN OBJECTIONS THAT STANDS TO REASON LENGTH OF THE NAME TOO CUMBERSOME. BUT THE BIGGEST OBJECTION. WAS THE FACT THAT HE WAS STILL ALIVE. IT STRUCK ME AS I WAS PREPARING THESE NOTES. WITHOUT OBJECTION. THE NOBODY HAS TO WORRY ABOUT ANYMORE. HIS LEGACY WILL LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION FOR YEARS TO COME. OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO HIS ENTIRE FAMILY. NASA THE SENATE ADJOURNED IN MEMORY OF THIS DISTINGUISHED LEADERS CIVIL RIGHTS CHAMPION IN MENTOR TO SO MANY THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER COURTESY CENTER WHY COST. I TO RISE AND- MEMORY OF FIVE NORMAN Y. MINETA THERE WAS A LIGHTER SIDE OF TECH- SECRETARY MINETA AND THEN ALL THE OTHER- OF FACTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE HAS SOME.

IN YEARS LATER SIX SEVEN YEARS LATER HE WALKS UP TO AT SOME OF IT WHEN I'M WITH MY MOTHER IN SAYS HELEN HOW ARE YOU DOING. AND HOW IS YOUR SISTER SOPHIE. AND THOSE WERE THINGS THAT NORMAN ADDED DID ALL THE TIME TO FOLKS- MY BY STANDARD WORDS- AND PETE STARK IN NORMAN AT A HAD PLACES ON THE- CHESAPEAKE BAY SUVI SUSIE ELVING WHICH WAS.

THAT WAS HIS HIS JOKE YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE SAY HOW DID YOU GET AN AIRPORT NAMED AFTER HE WOULD TURN AROUND AND HE WAS SELF DEPRECATING IN THAT WAY DID YOU SAY I DON'T KNOW WHY MY PARENTS NAME. AND AIRPORT AFTER ME- HE- WAS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM TENNESSEE SAID IT REALLY HURT HIM- WHEN HE WAS IDENTIFIED AS SAID A NINETY MILLION AND NON CITIZEN AND HE AND IT THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE CHERISHED IS THAT IS THAT SB EVEN AS A TEN YEAR OLD I CAN'T HAVE MY GOVERNMENT NOT RECOGNIZE ME AS A CITIZEN SO- HERE'S TO YOU- NORMAN Y.

THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT OF I THINK THATTHE US SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE WAS INCREDIBLY ELOQUENT IN HIS MEMORY OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF US SECRETARY MINETA AND HE AND SENATOR SIMPSON ACTUALLY TOGETHER VISITED THE CAMP IN WYOMING REGULAR WAY TO CALL ATTENTION INTO IT AND DO IT. BUT THE SENATOR FROM FREMONT SORT OF STRUCK THE THING THAT I WANTED TO STRIKE BECAUSE HE WAS A HUMAN BEING. HE ALWAYS REMEMBERED YOUR NAME BUT HE HAD THIS INCREDIBLE SENSE OF HUMOR. HE AND- LEON PANETTA HAD A JOINT SOFTBALL TEAM IN THE LEGISLATIVE WEEK AND IT WAS CALLED. THE HOUSE OF TE RISING PIZZA. WHICH IS VERY LOVED AND THEY TOLD EVERYBODY ABOUT AND THE ONE THING THAT THOSE OF US. FEDERAL ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT HAVE BEEN THROUGH RACES WOULD APPRECIATE THAT HE DID. IS LATER IN HIS CAREER HE WAS ISSUE HE WOULD ONE OR SEVENTY OR 80% OF THE VOTE. IN EVERY ELECTION HE WOULD WALK ONE PRECINCT. YOU WOULD FIND OUT WHAT THE PRECINCT WAS OF HIS OPPONENT. AND HE WOULD WALK EVERY HOUSE IN THAT PRECINCT AND THAT WAS THE ONE PRECINCT TO ANY TOOK GREAT PLEASURE WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT IT. HE WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT WHERE HE WENT ON THE BLOCK OF HIS OPPONENT AND HE JUST ENJOYED IT AND I THINK THE THING ABOUT IT IS IT TOO OFTEN WE IDOLIZE SOMEBODY. FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENTS BUT THEY FORGET WHAT A HUMAN THEY WERE AND WHAT HUMANITY THEY SHOWED AND HE WAS THE BEST HARM PROUD TO. JOIN IN ADJOURNING IN HIS MEMORY.
