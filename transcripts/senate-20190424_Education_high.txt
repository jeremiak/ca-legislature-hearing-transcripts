GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT IN. NINETEEN NINETY TWO VERY LITTLE HAS CHANGED IN THE LAWS GOVERNING CHARTER SCHOOLS. HOWEVER THE LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOLS ORIGINALLY NO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED STATEWIDE. AND A MAXIMUM OF TEN IN ANY DISTRICT HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY ALTERED WITH OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED CHARTER SCHOOLS STATEWIDE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. AND NO SERIOUS GROWTH WILL LIMITS ON GROWTH. CLEAR ISSUES HAVE ARISEN THEIR REQUIRED CALIFORNIA TO ENGAGE IN THE DEEPER EVALUATION OF THE CHARTER SYSTEM WITH IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. A FIVE YEAR PAUSE ON NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SET UP POLICIES. MEANT TO PRESERVE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND FOR CAREFUL EVALUATION OF THOSE POLICIES. THE PAS WOULD END UP UPON COMPLETION OF A SYSTEMATIC STATEWIDE EVALUATION OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. THIS WILL PROVIDE ALL OF US THE TIME IN THE SPACE TO RECONSIDER WHETHER OUR CURRENT. FRAMEWORK FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS IS WORKING AND REFLECTIVE OF OUR VALUES. THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT HAS NOT BEEN SERIOUSLY EVALUATED OR REFORMED IN NEARLY THIRTY YEARS. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL A CHARTER SCHOOL MORATORIUM WOULD BE ENACTED ONLY IF THE FOLLOWING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT ARE NOT ADOPTED. ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS LOCATED WITHIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MUST BE APPROVED ONLY BY THE DEMOCRATIC BODY ELECTED TO OVERSEE EDUCATION WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE DISTRICT. THE ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD WILL HAVE COMPLETE DISCRETION REGARDING WHICH PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO PLACE WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION. NO SCHOOLS WILL BE PERMITTED TO LOCATE WITHIN A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE DISTRICT CONTROLLING THE JURISDICTION. THE OVERALL FINANCIAL ACADEMIC AND FACILITIES IMPACT A NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS MUST BE A CONSIDERATION. BEFORE A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL IS APPROVED BY A SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STATE WIDE AND DISTRICT CHARTER SCHOOL CAPS THAT CREATE REASONABLE LIMITS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE VIABILITY AND THE SUCCESS. OF EXISTING DISTRICT SCHOOLS. SISTERS AND BROTHERS THE STRENGTH OF EVERY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY IS INSEPARABLE. FROM THE STRENGTH OF ITS SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. OUR BILL IS B. SEVEN FIVE SIX ENABLES MEANING FULL EVALUATION AN ANALYSIS OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND CREATES THE NECESSARY SPACE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF VITAL REFORMS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT. FINALLY BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR WITNESSES I WANT TO SAY MADAM CHAIR I AM AWARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. AND I COMMIT TO WORKING WITH YOU. IN ADDRESSING CONCERNS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE SO THAT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE CAN MOVE FORWARD. TODAY WE HAVE THREE WITNESSES HILDA RODRIGUEZ WITH MY ON A CHARTER SCHOOL PARENT FROM LOS ANGELES.

LEYVA HERE WILK PRESIDENT WILL CARE CHIANG TO WRESTLE HERE LASSEN HERE GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN. PAN HERE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS IN BATTLE TO GET SCHOOLS OF MINE. AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN FIFTY SIX I AM A FOUNDING PARENT OF THE ACCELERATED SCHOOL AND WALLIS ANNENBERG HIGH SCHOOL ALL THREE OF MY CHILDREN ATTENDED THESE TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE A GROUP OF THREE INDEPENDENT CHARTER SCHOOLS. IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES ANGELES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED BY LAUSD MY GRANDSON IS CURRENTLY ATTENDING XCELERATED CHARTER SCHOOL ELEMENTARY I. T. K. THROUGH SIX SISTERS SCHOOL OF THE ACCELERATED SCHOOLS. I HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH THE ACCELERATED SCHOOL SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR I WAS ELATED BY WHAT I WAS TOLD ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT I WOULD HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND WOULD BE PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING. INITIALY I WATCHED. BUT THIS EXPERIENCE WAS SHORT LIVED. THE TRUTH IS THAT I WAS MISLED. BY THE CHARTER SCHOOL INDUSTRY. THEY CAME INTO MY COMMUNITY AND THEY PROMISED US THINGS THEY PROMISED TO SERVE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE KIDS. BUT THEY'D BE DON'T. MY TRAUMA BEGAN WHEN PARENTS ARE SCHOOL OBSERVED A HIGH TEACHER TURNOVER WE LOST THE MAJORITY OF OUR TEACHERS AND AS PARENTS WE ORGANIZE AND BEGAN TO DEMAND ANSWERS FROM MARCOLE FOUNDERS. I DISCOVERED THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS HAVE NO EDUCATION BACKGROUND AND THEY DON'T LIVE IN OUR SURROUNDING COULDN'T NEIGHBORHOODS. BUT THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IN FUTURE THIS HAS BEEN CONCERNING FOR ME. I'M NOT RELATE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY. I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. I MADE THE MISTAKE OF ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT SCHOOL BUDGETS AND HOW FUNDS WERE BEING SPENT TO HELP OUR KIDS. IN MY TWENTY FOUR YEARS WITH THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS I HAVE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED THINGS THAT MAKE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A FUTURE A HUGE PROBLEM AND A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. TIME AND TIME AGAIN I HAVE SEEN THE RULES AND THE REGULATIONS THAT CURRENTLY GOVERN CHARTER SCHOOLS IGNORED AND DISREGARDED. AT THE AT CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH LITTLE TO NO CONSEQUENCES AND IT HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. MY YOUNGEST SON WITH DISABILITIES AND NINE WERE UNABLE TO GET THE CHARTER SCHOOL TO PROVIDE HIM SUPPORT THE CHARTER SCHOOL MY CHILDREN ATTENDED COUNSELED MANY STUDENTS OUT WITH DISABILITIES TELLING THEM. THAT THING. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO MEET THE STUDENTS NEEDS SO IT'S BEST TO ROOMMATE FOR THEM TO REMAIN IN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT THE CHARTER SCHOOL ALSO FALSIFIES GREAT SO IT SEEMS THE STUDENTS ARE DOING WELL. WHEN IN FACT THEY'RE NOT I HAVE PERSONALLY BEEN THREATENED BY THE SPECIAL EDUCATION DIRECTOR AND BY MY SCHOOLS CO FOUNDERS FOR SPEAKING OUT? ABOUT PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND OUR SCHOOLS DO NOT GET ENOUGH FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT IT'S IF STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS LIKE MINOR PUSHED OUT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL DISTRICT AT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. DISTRICT SCHOOLS ASSUME HIGHER FINANCIAL BURDEN. IT IS NOT FAIR. THE CURRENT SYSTEM HARMS THAT ONLY FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES BUT ENTIRE THIS ABOVE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION WHEN I NAIVELY. TRIED TO SEEK ASSISTANCE FOR MY SON THAT WAS HEARD IN MY CHILDREN. WE WERE SUFFERING I WAS BLOCKED. I POSTED THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE OF MY FAMILY ON FACEBOOK ON THE FACEBOOK PAGE OF THE CART CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION. POSTED MAR DRAMATICS EXPERIENCES WITH MY BLOCK [inaudible] I WOULD. MY EXPEDIT X.. READING EGGS. NOT ALIGNED WITH THE SCENE THERE. WERE TRYING. IN MY COMMUNITY. THE CHARTER SCHOOL LAW IS BROKE IT STUDENTS OF COLOR IN POOR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND CHILDREN. LIKE MINE. MOST HARMED BY THESE BROKEN CHARTER SCHOOL LAWS THE ONGOING WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE IN THE WILD WEST OF THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS IS ROBERT STUDENTS OF COLOR OF MILLIONS OF FUNDING. OVER THE YEARS CHARTER SCHOOLS MAY HELP ME HELP SOME KIDS. BUT THAT'S NOT MY EXPERIENCE. THEY HAVE DONE DAMAGE THEY HAVE DONE DAMAGE TO MY COMMUNITY. AND WE HAVE TO STOP THE BLEEDING BEFORE WE CAN HILL WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A MORATORIUM ON YOUR CHARTER SCHOOLS WE NEED MUCH STRONGER SYSTEMS OF LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY. OUR STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING THERE IS A DIRECT HARM THAT HAS OCCURRED WITH MY CHILDREN. AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES. CHARTER SCHOOL MURDERER WILL GIVE US THIS TIME. IT'S TIME TO BRING THEM ENSURE THAT THESE FLAWS IN THE CURRENT LAW ANSWER FIX BEFORE. FOR MORE DAMAGE IS DONE OUR URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT SB. SEVEN FIFTY SIX OUR CHILDREN ARE NO LONGER GAINEY KEEP PIGS WE CANNOT AFFORD. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR MOVING TESTIMONY -- SHE USED UP ALL OF THE TIME PLUS SOME SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THIRTY SECONDS OKAY IT WAS TWO MINUTES FOR EACH AYE BUT VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. SO YOU HAVE THIRTY SECONDS. I THANK YOU MY NAME IS DOCTOR X. ON A MARRIAGE SHE I'M HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AND EIGHT AND DOUBLE ACP WE ARE CO SPONSORING SB SEVEN FIFTY SIX TO ESTABLISH A MORATORIUM. ON NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE. THE UNREGULATED GROWTH OF CHARTER SCHOOLS HAS LED TO INCREASED SEGREGATION INTO INEQUITABLE RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS THAT HAVE LEFT STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH DISPROPORTIONATELY FEWER RESOURCES. A MORATORIUM ON NEW CHARTER AUTHORIZATION BUT PROVIDE TIME TO STRENGTHEN CHARTER ACCOUNTABILITY LEGISLATION AND PROPHECIES AND ENSURE THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DO NOT EXACERBATE SEGREGATION SELECTIVELY RECRUIT AND ENROLL NOR DENY YOU TO QUALITY TEACHING AND LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT ALL STUDENTS. DESERVE. AB THE INCREASING FREQUENCY OF SCHOOL CLOTHES OPENINGS AND CLOSURES WITH IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS CREATES INSTABILITY AND COMMUNITY FRACTURING WHAT IS THE COST TO THE STATE TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND YOUR COMMUNITIES OF THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF SCHOOLS THAT HAD RED FLAGS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. WHAT IS THE COST TO TAXPAYERS OF THE STAFF TIME TO REVIEW CHARTER PETITIONS THAT GO THROUGH LINK THE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS THESE ONLY TO BE SHUT DOWN DUE TO FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT? WHAT ARE THE EDUCATIONAL IMPACT TO STUDENTS ATTENDING CHARTER SAID ABRUPTLY CLOSE ORDER STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS WHOSE FUNDS FOR SERVICES OR DECREASE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF CHARTER EXPANSION? I'M SORRY THE TIME AYE AYE. THREE MINUTES HAVE COME FROM SANDERS I'M REPRESENTING I'M SORRY BUT WE'RE VERY CLEAR WE HAVE A VERY PACKED AGENDA SHE TOOK FIVE MINUTES YOUNG I HAD FOR TOTAL SO THINKING. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION LOOK FOR TO WORKING I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YU VERY MUCH I WOULD ASK OTHERS IN SUPPORT TO STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND IF YOU SUPPORT THE MEASURE.

PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THE CENTER ON REINVENTING PUBLIC EDUCATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. CLOSER TO YOU. EIGHT THANK YOU YOU WELCOME MORNING MY NAME IS ROBIN LAKE I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER ON REINVENTING PUBLIC EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE. HERE TODAY IS A RESEARCHER NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS OR DISTRICT SCHOOLS. I AM AN ADVOCATE FOR EVIDENCE ABOUT -- WHATEVER WILL HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED. OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'VE STUDIED HOW DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN CO EXIST AND EVEN WORK TOGETHER TOWARD SHARED ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL GOALS. CITIES LIKE INDIANAPOLIS WHERE SPEND SOME TIME SHOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND FOR DECADES -- INDIANAPOLIS PUBLIC SCHOOLS LOS MIDDLE CLASS STUDENTS TO NEARBY DISTRICTS. LOW INCOME STUDENTS STARTED LEAVING AS WELL WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC MAYOR OF INDIANAPOLIS STARTED AUTHORIZING CHARTER SCHOOLS AS AN ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION STRATEGY. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING FAMILIES CHOICES THE RESPONSE FROM INDIANAPOLIS PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE DISTRICT HAS BEEN TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL CHARTER SCHOOLS. PROVIDING ACCESS TO DISTRICT BUILDINGS IN CENTRAL OFFICE SERVICES. IN EXCHANGE THE DISTRICT RECEIVES A PORTION OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL FUNDS AND AND IS USING AUTONOMY. AS AN IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY FOR ALL OF ITS SCHOOLS TO FREE EDUCATORS TO TRANSFORM THEIR SCHOOLS. I PS IS NOW GROWING IN A ROMANCE AND IMPORTANTLY IN QUALITY OUTCOMES. THE EXPERTS -- AND AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHERS REALLY AGREE -- WHEN WE LOOKED ACROSS ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT FISCAL STRESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN? I WILL CONTINUE TO BE A REALITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WITH OR WITHOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS THE INDIANAPOLIS SHOWS THAT DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN COME TOGETHER TO MAKE MORE HIGH QUALITY CHOICES FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE FOR STUDENTS. TEMPORARY TRANSITION AID CAN HELP DISTRICTS ADJUSTING THE REVENUE REALITIES MORE FLEXIBILITY FROM THE STATE CAN HELP DISTRICTS BE MORE NIMBLE AND EFFICIENT. BUT HOLDING ONLY LOW INCOME FAMILIES HOSTAGE BY LIMITING ACCESS TO SCHOOLS THAT SERVE THEM WHILE. IS NOT. A SOLUTION. OPEN ENROLLMENT LOSS FOR WHATEVER REASON CONCERTS DESTABILIZE DISTRICTS HOWEVER STUDIES THE INFLATE FIX COSTS DO THIS IMPORTANT DEBATE A DISSERVICE. BY INTRODUCING HYPERBOLE WERE RIGOROUS ANALYSIS IS NEEDED. THE QUESTION I THINK BEFORE -- BEFORE ALL OF US IS IS WHETHER WE CAN PUT PLATE PUT IN PLACE SYSTEMS THAT ENABLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADAPT. AND IMPROVE HOW THEY SERVE STUDENTS IN THE FACE OF THESE REALITIES THAT WILL NOT BE GOING AWAY AND INSTEAD -- WILL REINFORCE THE SCAPEGOATING THAT REALLY HELPS NOBODY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING CARLOS MARQUEZ HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION HERE REPRESENT OUR STRENUOUS OPPOSITION TO SB. SEVEN FIVE SIX WHICH PLACES IN AND YOU IN AND TENABLE POSITION IT HOLD YOU HOSTAGE TO DISMISS ENTIRELY THE WELL DOCUMENTED ACADEMIC GAINS THE CHARTERS ARE ACHIEVING WITH FOLDABLE STUDENTS. BY FOR CLOSING ON NEW HIGH QUALITY SEATS FOR FIVE YEARS OR TO SANCTION INTENT LANGUAGE THE PLACES YOU'RE COMMITTEE ON RECORD SUPPORTING EQUALLY EXTREME POLICIES THAT IF ENACTED COULD RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF EXISTING HIGH QUALITY SCHOOLS. IMPOSING ULTIMATUMS ON A LEGISLATIVE BODY IS DELIVERED OF AS THE SENATE UNDERMINES THE DEBATE WE SHOULD BE HAVING WHICH IS HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MODERNIZE THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT. TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP SCALE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY INNOVATION ACROSS ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND REIMAGINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHARTER SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS IN COLLABORATIVE IN SUSTAINABLE TERMS. PROPONENTS OF SB SEVEN FIVE SIX DOWN PLAY THE TIME FRAME OF FIVE YEARS SO LET'S INTERROGATE THAT. FIVE YEARS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT TODAY'S GENERATION OF THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BLACK AND LATINO BOYS WILL BE WEARING A CAP AND GOWN OR A JUMPSUIT. IN -- IN FIVE YEARS TODAY'S KINDERGARTENERS WILL MATRICULATED TO FOURTH GRADE WE KNOW THAT BY THIRD GRADE IF YOU AREN'T ABLE TO READ. IT'S A PREDICATE FOR THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME FRAME OF FIVE YEARS IS ABSOLUTELY CONSEQUENTIAL BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INTENT LANGUAGE IT GETS WORSE IF IT WAS AN ACTED AS SUBSTANTIVE POLICY. IT WOULD DISMANTLE EXISTING DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND THREATEN EXISTING HIGH QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOLS AND FOR WHAT WHY IS IT THAT THE PROPONENTS OF SB SEVEN FIVE SIX FEEL SO PASSIONATELY THAT THIS BILL MUST PROVE MOVE FOR TODAY. WHEN THE CHARTER TASK FORCE IS JUST WEEKS AWAY FROM RELEASING ITS FINAL REPORT AND BASED ON WHAT PREMISE WE KNOW THAT 75% OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT CERTIFIED QUALIFIED BUDGETS OVER THE LAST YEAR? HAD NO MORE THAN TWO CHARTER SCHOOLS AND A THIRD HAD NO CHARTER SCHOOLS WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHY. IN FACT THERE'S LITTLE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THE CAUSAL DRIVER OF FISCAL DISTRESS. A BODY OF INDEPENDENT RESEARCH BACKS THIS UP SO WHETHER IT'S TRANSITIONAL EIGHT OR SURPLUS PROPERTY AUTHORIZING AUTHORIZATION REFORM MORE SPECIAL EDUCATION WE STAND READY. WITH REAL SOLUTIONS THAT IMPROVE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM FOR ALL KIDS BUT WE REJECT SB SEVEN SIXTY FIVE IS THAT SOLUTION AND WE URGE YOUR KNOW ABOUT Q.. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'LL PLEASE LINE UP STATE YOUR NAME. YOUR ORGANIZATION AND IT WHETHER YOU SUPPORTER BUT OPPOSE THE BILL. LET'S LET'S GIVE IT JUST A SECOND SINCE IT'S A LITTLE NOISY OKAY I THINK WE'RE READY PLEASE PROCEED. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BRUNCH A JONES ABAFT CHARTER SCHOOL CAPITAL IBM IN K.

THANK YOU IS THERE ANY FURTHER OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS [inaudible] DOCTOR PAN. I THANK THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. AND SEND DRAWS A PRE SHEET -- US THE CONCERNS THAT -- EVEN THE PROPONENTS -- HAVE -- BROUGHT UP -- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE I THINK WE THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEIR CHALLENGES ACTUALLY AND BOTH SYSTEMS RIGHT IT'S IT'S AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME. AS MY SICK BOTH SYSTEMS I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE -- EXCELLENT PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THERE ARE SOME WHO NEED HELP -- WE HAVE A CENTERS SCHOOLS WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE. NOT SO -- SO I THINK IT'S LESS ABOUT. JUST THE SYSTEM BUT AT SAME TIME WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL. THE CALL INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE BUT CHALLENGES WHERE -- RESOURCES ARE TOO FRAGMENTED ACROSS -- POTENTIALLY WITH MULTIPLE SCHOOLS -- WE MAY HAVE CHALLENGES WHERE -- YOU HAVE -- THAT SOMEONE. THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT LOCAL CONDITIONS -- AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD. ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND I RECOGNIZE THAT SORT OF THE WAY YOUR BILL STRUCTURE TO SIR LIKE WELL WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS WE SHOULD HAVE THE CITIZENS BE MADE MORE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT -- AT AT THAT SCHOOL BOARD LEVEL WHERE YOU'LL BY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS BY. THE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. LIVING IN THAT THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT AND AND AND LEADERSHIP AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A PRIMARY ROLE AND AND AND BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS. ABOUT SCHOOLS AND PLACEMENT AND AND AND AND RESOURCES -- AS SO I GUESS. ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS THAT ARE WHEN ISSUES CONCERNS I HAVE IS IS THAT SO WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT SIR. MORATORIUM ON LESS AND THERE'S A SET OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THE UNLESS OUR AND IN MANY OF WHICH ACTUALLY FRANKLY I FAVOR RIGHT -- AND I GUESS I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AND SAYS SAYING WHAT WE HAVE A MORATORIUM UNLESS AND WE'RE WAITING. FOR BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME BILLS ON THE CELL LEADER LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE THINGS. TO JUST MORE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY GO OUT AND SAY WELL ACTUALLY WHAT WE WANT IS THAT WE'RE GONNA SAY. CHARTER SCHOOL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE AT THE LOCAL THAT THE UNLESS PART GREAT THAT THAT THE CHARTER SCHOOL DECISION YOU KNOW THAT. LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO APPROVE OR NOT A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT'S WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARY RIGHT. THAT SHOULD CERTAINLY BE DECISION MADE BY THE ELECTED LEADERSHIP -- THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD -- THAT THEY SHOULD TAKING CONSIDERATION WHAT THE RESOURCES ARE. AND THAT PERHAPSYOU KNOW I THINK ONE FOR IS ANOTHER PROVISION IS IS THAT THE THAT THE THAT THERE'S THERE'S SOME STATEWIDE EXAMINATION APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A REPORT COMING OUT FROM THE ON THE GOVERNOR HAS A TASK FORCE THAT. WE'RE HOPING TO HEAR FROM AND AND AND AND AND AND I GUESS SEVERAL WEEKS -- AND A COUPLE MONTHS -- WHICH ACTUALLY HOPEFULLY WILL ALSO INFORM Là JUST. EITHER LEGISLATION OTHER LEGISLATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WELL. SO I GUESS I WANTED BECAUSE WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO AND REALIZING TIS IS THE COMMITTEE MEETING RIGHT HERE AND I HAD SOME OPTING TO DISCUSS WITH BILL'S PROPONENTS IN OPPOSITION. TO THINKING ABOUT RE FRAMING THE BILL THIS WAY -- MOVING FORWARD AND AND AND MAKING AMENDMENTS -- TO IT THAT WILL NOT BE TAKEN UP HERE BUT THE FUTURE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD REFLECT THAT. TYPE OF APPROACH IS IS SAYING A MORATORIUM UNLESS STATE ASK FOR WHAT YOU WANT GREAT IT'S BASICALLY WE WANT. LOCAL DECISION MAKING WE WHAT DOES WE WANT THAT KIND OF EVALUATION IS BEING DONE. AND THAT AND THAT WE WANT TO POWER THE THE THE THE THE AND I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE AND EMPOWER THE THE PEOPLE IN SCHOOL DISTRICT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. BASICALLY MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT NEED NEED TO MAKE -- ABOUT ABOUT -- THESE DECISIONS SO I WENT TO SUPPOSE THAT THE DOCTOR PAN AS THE CHAIR -- I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THESE AMENDMENTS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS FOR SENATOR DORADO TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES IN CONCEPT ON HER WAY TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE. CORRECT BECAUSE THEY THEY SAID I TELL I DON'T HAVE ANY AMENDMENTS SPECIFIC AMEND ITS EITHER OKAY I THINK IT THIS IS BASED ON THE DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH -- BUT WITH -- FOLKS -- BUT I THINK IT'S A SORT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND SO I I WANTED TO POSE THAT -- BECAUSE I THINK I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE TAKING THAT KIND OF APPROACH THAN. THE CURRENT APPROACH WHICH IS ACTUALLY DOING IS READING A MORATORIUM AND THAT SAYS UNLESS CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN BUT AND SAID LET'S JUST GO FOR THE THINGS WE WANT AND THE SPECIFICS WILL YOU KNOW. I'M SURE YOU WILL GET WORKED OUT OF ARTS IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC. AMENDMENTS BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE TAKING PLACE BUT THE WORK ON ON THAT APPROACH WHICH IS I. THANKS VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH WHAT AT LEAST THE BILL. AS I LOOK AT IT -- THIS TRYING TO COMPLEX ANYWAY. UNDERSTOOD SENATOR RUSSELL YES I AND I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU -- CENTER PAN AYE I DID SAY EARLY IN MY OPENING REMARKS THAT I'M AWARE OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS CONCERNS -- AND I COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AND WITH THE CHAIR ON ON THESE CONCERNS WITHOUT GETTING INTO OBVIOUSLY ANY PARTICULARS RIGHT NOW -- AT THIS POINT IN TIME. ANOTHER QUESTION YES GO AHEAD NOT THAT THANK YOU SO -- SO I AS I I'VE. I'VE YEAH SAID IN TERMS OF PARTICULARS I THINK AT LEAST IN CONCEPT. THE AGE ON SUGARS YOU SURE THERE'S AGREEMENT THAT ON ENDS ON THE PROVISIONS IN YOUR VERY BILL -- THAT THAT THAT'S THE THE THINGS WE'D BE LOOKING AT CORRECT US YES OKAY ARE IN CONCEPT THANK YOU BOTH. SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WHAT I WANT TAKE EVERYBODY FOR COMING TO TESTIFY PARTICULARLY -- THOSE CONSTITUENTS FROM THE TWENTY FIRST SENATE DISTRICT I KNOW THAT'S A SIX MAYBE A SEVEN HOUR DRIVE AND PARTICULARLY ENJOYED MEETING THE CHARTERS -- SCHOOL STUDENTS YESTERDAY IN MY OFFICE. I'M A PUBLIC OF I'M A PRODUCT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS ARE MY CHILDREN. AND BUT I SUPPORT SCHOOL CHOICE. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S GREAT CHARTER SCHOOLS IS BAD CHARTER SCHOOLS IS AVERAGE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND CLEARLY -- THERE'S BEEN PROBLEMS AROUND AUTHORIZATION IN THE RE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS AND SOMEBODY WHO'S PRO SCHOOL CHOICE I ATE I ATE KNOWLEDGE I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AND I THINK WE NEED TO FIX IT -- THE CHAIR HAD A BILL EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT'S ALREADY PASS OUT OF THE SENT OVER OVER ON THIS ON THE SENATE SIDE TERMS OF GOD GREATER TRANSPARENCY WHICH I THINK WE NEED. AND AS MENTIONED BY DOCTOR PAN GONNA SERIES OF BILLS A LOT OF THEM INCORPORATING BUT YOU WANT TO DO THAT SHOULD BE SHOULD BE COMING HERE -- THE FIVE YEAR MORATORIUM I MEAN THAT'S JUST TAKING A SLEDGE HAMMER -- TO THE PROCESS AND YOU KNOW THE OPPONENTS MENTIONED THIS IS A DELIBERATE DELIVERED IT DELIVERED OF BODY WHICH I AGREE WITH WHICH I I APPRECIATE. I DON'T A FIVE YEAR MORATORIUM I JUST DON'T SEE HOW YOU GET THAT I JUST THINK THIS USE IN THE COURSE OF POWER GOVERNMENT. TO DENY A STUDENT CHOICE SO -- NOT AND OBVIOUSLY NOT NOT CAN BE WITH YOU TODAY -- AYE AYE. I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS BILL RADICALLY CHANGED MOVING FOR AND WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS -- PEOPLE ASK ARE YOU FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE STATE'S GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND I SAY NO BECAUSE BOTH A YOU KNOW. ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND AND THIS IS WHAT THE MAJORITY PEOPLE WANT I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE. THE BILL INNOVATION OF OF SCHOOLS SCHOOL CHOICE SO NOT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY HOPE YOU THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO COME TO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BENEFIT ALL STUDENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER WILK IF I CAN JUST -- COMMENT BRIEFLY -- THIS IS ABOUT PUBLIC EDUCATION. THIS IS ABOUT LOOKING TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING. AND WE'VE NEVER STOPPED TO DO THAT. AND MOVE FORWARD IN A MUCH MORE DELIBERATIVE INTEGRATED WAY AND FUNCTIONING AS ONE SINGLE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IT'S BECOME. TO AND BUT THE RESOURCES. COME FROM THE BROADER US SYSTEM. AND THEY GO. TO TO SYSTEMS THEY'RE COMPETING. AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY PUBLIC EDUCATION SHOULD FUNCTION. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHOICE AND COMPETITION THAT BASICALLY. IS GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SO -- I'M A BIG PUBLIC EDUCATION PERSON AS WELL THAT'S WHY JUMPED INTO THIS THIS IS NOT A POPULAR POSITION TO TAKE -- I HAVE MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS I HAVE OBVIOUSLY MANY PUBLIC EDUCATION TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS WE HAVE NONTRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T ALL FUNCTION THE SAME WAY THIS PILOT SCHOOLS MAGNET SCHOOLS IS ALL KINDS OF SCHOOLS. AND SO. THERE'S A PARTICULAR SET OF RULES AND REGULATIONS. THAT HAVE APPLIED ONLY TO THE CHARTERS AND MY ONLY. POSITION HERE IS LET'S TAKE A PAUSE. SO THAT WE ALL PUT THE BEST PRACTICES FORWARD AND FIX WHAT'S WRONG. AND SO I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM AND THAT'S WHY I JUMPED INTO. INTO DOING THIS. DID YOU WANNA. NO OKAY I THINK SENATOR DRAWS OAK WAS AT ALL SENATOR WILK. I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID BUT FIVE YEARS IS NOT  PAUSE. FIVE YEARS JUST NOT A PAUSE -- WE'VE DONE THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT ANY. ANY REFORMS THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT IN THE ROOF RELEASE SIGNIFICANT REFORMS SO. THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT. THAT WAS FAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY EARLIER -- WILL BRING RUN AROUND A LOT OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS -- AND I I WANT TO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR -- FOR RELEASED THE INITIATING THIS CONVERSATION A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFICULTY ACROSS THE STATE IN THE SPACE -- A BIG -- DEBATED SAY THE OBVIOUS -- BIG PUBLIC SCHOOL ADVOCATES. AND I KNOW THAT'S THAT THE GOALS AND DESIRES THAT YOU HAVE AND I AND I SHARE THEM -- AND BUT THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS MUCH BROADER THAN THIS ISSUE OF CHARTERS. AND I THINK IT'S SENATOR PAN MANSION IN HIS REMARKS ND OTHERS -- THAT ACROSS THE SPECTRUM WE HAVE THE STRONG ONES. CHARTER'S STRONG PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND WE ALSO HAVE ONES THAT ARE JUST NOT DOING SO WELL. AND THAT REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION AND BUT IT'S AND IT'S MORE THAN JUST ABOUT CHARTERS -- IT'S ABOUT FINANCES. IT'S ABOUT QUALITY -- IT'S ABOUT -- AT TEACHER TRAINING. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT -- AND THAT'S WHY I APPLIED TO YOUR EFFORT TO GET INTO THE SPACE AND INITIATE THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. YES LOOK AT HOW LOUD PORT IS TO WHAT WE DO IS A STATE HOW MUCH MONEY WE DIRECT TO IT IT'S IT'S HUGE AND THE MORE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE THE BETTER. AND I AND I DON'T -- IGNORE -- THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE RAISING AS IMPORTANT AND BUT I ALSO THINK THAT KNOW THAT MIKE OBSERVATIONS TODAY ARE NOT GOING TO SURPRISE YOU. AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA SURPRISE OTHERS BECAUSE WE I TALKED ABOUT THEM IN JANUARY WHEN WE PASSED THE TRANSPARENCY BILL THAT. ARE CHAIR -- ADVANCED AND WE HAD THE CONVERSATION HERE IN EDUCATION AND WE HAD THE CONVERSATION ON THE FLOOR AND MY OBSERVATIONS THEN -- APPLY NOW WHICH IS THE THE GOVERNOR'S RECOGNIZE SOME CONCERNS IN THIS SPACE SUPERINTENDENTS RECOGNIZE SOME CONCERT IN SPACE. AND IT CREATED THIS TASK FORCE TO WORK IN THIS AREA TO TRY TO BRING PARTIES TOGETHER AND HAVE HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE COULD DO BETTER ACROSS THE BOARD -- AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW THAT PROCESS TO GO FORWARD AND NOT. INTERFERE IN IT UP THROUGH LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME WHEN WE CAN ALWAYS INITIATE THEM WE CAN ALWAYS STEP IN AFTER WE HEAR THOSE THOSE THOUGHTS IN THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT OF IT. SO MY MIND REMAINS OPEN. ABOUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE RAISED BUT FOR ME AT LEAST AND I'M NOT COMFORTABLE GOING FORWARD WITH THAT LEGISLATION I'D RATHER GIVE IT THE LEGISLATION APPLIES -- AND LET THE AT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHARTER COMMUNITY. OF THE TEACHER COMMUNITY OF THE STATE LEADERSHIP CONTINUE THEIR WORK I HOPE THAT THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTIVE WORK. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THEIR THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS IF THERE ARE ANY -- IN A IN A FEW WEEKS AND THEN WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SET UP SENATOR PAN. I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT WERE CLEARED THAT YOUR BILL ONLY. THE DRESSES SEXUALLY NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS RIGHT SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CLOSING EXIST I MEAN ASIDE FROM OUR SCHOOLS WHO DON'T BEAT THE THE USUAL PROCESS WOULD NOT CHANGING THAT SO IN TERMS OF EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS.

PLEASE ARE NO MCGUIRE PAN. PAN HI. BELIEVE THAT BILL ON CALL THANK YOU ALL WHO CAME OUT TODAY. OR I MEMBERS WE ARE NOW MOVING ON TO CENTER PORTANTINO I THINK I SAW HIM DOWN THERE OF SENATOR PORTANTINO WILL AT THE ROOM CLEAR A LITTLE BIT. AND I GET ON THE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR WHO NEEDS TO PRESENTS OF YOU CAN EXIT THE ROOM QUIETLY THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. I JUST DON'T FEEL STRONGLY THANK YOU. SENATOR PORTANTINO YOU HAVE TO BILLS UP WITH US TODAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN WITH SB EIGHTY SIX I WOULD EXCELLENT ADAM AS YOU EXIT PLEASE BE QUIET. WE HAVE FOR THE BUSINESS TO DO CENTER PORTANTINO BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. SINCE SINCE THIS IS THE MORNING OF EASY BILLS. I FIGURED I WOULD -- START WITH ANOTHER EASY BILL -- AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE THIS MORNING THAT WHEN I JUST STEPPED OUTSIDE I TRIPPED ON THE STEPS. AND HAD THE MOST AMAZING ROLL. I FELL AS GRACEFULLY AS I COULD. THIS IS A TRUE STORY I SAID TO THE AUDIENCE HOW MANY PEOPLE SAW ME FALL AND EVERY HAND WENT OUT. SO I ALTHOUGH WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY YES I Y. ONLY TWISTED MY LEFT ANKLE MY RIGHT KNEE AND MY BACK BUT OTHER THAN THAT. IT'S ALL GOOD WHICH BRINGS ME TO SB EIGHTY SIX WHICH REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONDUCT AGE APPROPRIATE LOCKED DOWN AND MULTI OPTION DRILLS FREE SCHOOL YEAR SO KIDS DON'T TRIP. WHEN THEY LEAVE THE BUILDING -- I DO WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT -- WHEN I PUT IN THIS BILL I WAS NOT AWARE THAT MS BATES HAD A SIMILAR BILL AND CERTAINLY I'M GOING -- TO AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO FOR HER AND WORK WITH HER AND YOU KNOW HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR HER. AND WOULD NOT OF INTRODUCED A BILL IF I'D KNOWN SHE WAS ALREADY ON THIS TOPIC SO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT -- SCHOOL SHOOTINGS HAVE BECOME AN ALL TOO FREQUENT OCCURRENCE IN THE UNITED STATES UNFORTUNATELY -- AND CALIFORNIA IS NOT IMMUNE TO START DESPITE OUR STRONG LAWS -- LOCKDOWN DRILLS ARE BEING INDUCTED BY CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FOR PAST TWENTY YEARS THEY ARE CARRIED OUT AT THE DISCRETION OF EACH SCHOOL AND ARE NOT MANDATED FOR FREQUENCY. LIKE FIRE AND EARTHQUAKE DRILLS A WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE CITES A STAGGERING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND CHILDREN HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO GUN VIOLENCE WHILE ON SCHOOL GROUNDS SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY NINE BUT TRAGICALLY ANOTHER HUNDRED FORTY THREE HAVE. BEEN KILLED IN TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR HAVE BEEN INJURED WHILE ON CAMPUS AND AT THE AYE REPORT REVEALED SCHOOLS WERE THE SECOND HIGHEST RISK LOCATION. FOR AN ACTIVE SHOOTER EVENT FREQUENCY OF FIRE DRILLS ARE MANDATE AND REGULATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ONCE A MONTH IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND NOT LESS THAN TWICE A YEAR IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS EARTHQUAKE DRILLS ARE MANDATED AND REGULATED TO FOUR TIMES PER YEAR IN SCHOOLS. AND DESPITE THE FREQUENCY OF FIRE DRILLS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS NO CHILDREN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A SCHOOL FIRE IN THE U. S. -- SINCE OUR LADY OF ANGEL SCHOOL FIRE IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT SB EIGHTY SIX WHICH ENSURE ADMINISTRATORS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE MORE EQUITABLY PREPARED BY STAFF BUSHING A MINIMUM FREQUENCY. OF AGE APPROPRIATE LOCKDOWN DRILLS AND I WITH THIS PERSPECTIVE WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT ME AND RE GAY ROUTE SHOW FROM THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TO LOCK DOWN INCIDENTS HAD LA UNIFIED SEVENTY NINE FIRES REPORTED AND THANKFULLY IN ZERO EARTHQUAKE INCIDENTS THAT'S FAR -- ARE LOCKDOWN PROCEDURES ARE USED TO PROTECT STUDENTS IN A VARIETY OF SIR CONTENT BECAUSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE DNGER IS OUTSIDE. INCLUDING GUNSHOTS HER NEARBY AND POLICE ACTIVITY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS A RESULT WE BELIEVE THAT LOCKDOWN DRILLS WORK TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT AS BE EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING AND HEARING THAT IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. BROUGH BACK THE COMMITTEE SENATOR GLAZERS. AN ANSWER PAN UPSET SENATOR PORTANTINO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR SO THE BILL HAS BEEN CHANGED NOW THAT. ONLY AT OR IT DOESN'T REALLY RIGHT MANDATE. A LOCKDOWN DRILL ONCE A YEAR FOUR TIMES A YEAR NOW IT SIMPLY -- ENCOURAGES THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY AT THEIR DISCRETION TO CONSIDER DOING THAT AND AGE APPROPRIATE WAY IS THAT RIGHT. DO NOT USURPING LOCAL CONTROL ON THIS CHOICE YOU'RE JUST GIVING THEM GUIDANCE. AND WHAT YOU THINK COULD BE A HEALTHY THING TO DO RIGHT. GOT IT GREAT HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL TO APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CENTER PAN.

LEYVA AYE WELL HI WILK I CHIANG. CHIANG I'D RUSSELL. GLAZER GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PAN. PAN AYE. BELIEVE THAT BILL ON CALL SO THAT OTHER -- MEMBERS CAN ADD ON OR IT SENATOR PORTANTINO WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO FILE ITEM SEVEN SB. THREE TWENTY EIGHT BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I KNOW I'VE GOT SOME WITNESSES COMING UP YEAH TAKE YOUR TIME. FIRST I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR -- FOR TAKING SO MUCH TIME IN OUR DISCUSSIONS LEADING UP TO THE COMMITTEE I KNOW THIS IS A BILL THAT -- SHE IN THE COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE PUT -- ACTION CUT SENATORS HAVE PUT SIGNIFICANT TIME IN LOOKING OUT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND I APPRECIATE. THAT THIS BILL HAS GENERATED SUCH THOUGHTFUL INQUIRY AND RESEARCH AND TIME SO I APPRECIATE THAT -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- TEENAGERS. IN OUR COUNTRY ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED. IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC AND ACCORDING TO CONCLUSIVE MEDICAL RESEARCH THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EPIDEMIC. HIS EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES THAT ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH THE BIOLOGICAL SLEEP. NEEDS OF ADOLESCENT CHILDREN SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY EIGHT WILL UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION CODE. WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PARAMETERS FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL START TIMES. THE REGULAR SCHOOL DAY BEGINS ACCORDING TO THE BILL NO EARLIER THAN EIGHT THIRTY AM OR LATER AS RECOMMENDED. BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AND MANY OTHER HEALTH AND MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS. DESPITE DECADES OF OVERWHELMING AND COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE HARM TO TEENS HARM TO TEENS FROM EARLY WAKE UP TIMES THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA SECONDARY SCHOOLS ABOUT 80%. STILL BEGIN BEFORE EIGHT THIRTY AM SO EARLY THAT THEY PREVENT MOST TEENS FROM GETTING THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED NINE HOURS OF SLEEP. FOR THEIR GROWING BODIES AND BRAIN NEEDS ACCORDING TO THE CDC THE AVERAGE SECONDARY SCHOOL START TIME IN CALIFORNIA IS. EIGHT OH SEVEN AND MANY STARTS START SCHOOL FIRST PERIOD BEFORE. SEVEN THIRTY EARLY SECONDARY SCHOOL START TIMES HARM CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND SAFETY IN MANY MANY WAYS. INSUFFICIENCY AMONG ADOLESCENTS CAUSES HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION. ANXIETY SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS OBESITY DIABETES DROWSY DRIVING CAR ACCIDENTS SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SPORTS INJURIES. THESE EARLY HOURS ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER. TWO CAUSES OF DEATH AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE CAR ACCIDENTS AND SUICIDE. THE STATUS QUO ALSO CAUSES WORSE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SLEEP TO PROVIDE APPROBATION AMONG ADOLESCENTS STUDENTS BECAUSE THE SLEEPING IN CLASS. DIFFICULTY PAYING ATTENTION FORGETFULNESS ABSENCES MORE TARDY'S MORE DISCIPLINE ACTION WORSE GRADES AND TEST SCORES AND HIGHER DROPOUT RATES IN THIS IS NOT ANECDOTAL. DATA THIS IS HARD COLD FACTUAL DATA. THE STATUS QUO IS ACTUALLY WIDENING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND HEALTH DISPARITIES AT OUR STATE BECAUSE EARLY STARTS ARE PROVEN TO HER DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN THE MOST. FRANKLY THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS ON JOSH ON SO MANY LEVELS MANY STUDENTS SHOW THAT DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN AREADY GET LESS SLEEP THAN THEIR MORE PRIVILEGE PEERS. THEY FACE MORE OBSTACLES GETTING UP EARLY BELLS ON TIME. AND THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE HARM OF DEVELOPMENTALLY INAPPROPRIATE START TIMES. THE GOOD NEWS IS ACCORDING TO-THE CDC LATER START TIMES ARE THE SINGLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. LATER START TIMES ARE THE SINGLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION WITH THE POTENTIAL TO HELP THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CHILDREN TO COMBAT THE ADOLESCENT SLEEP LOSS EPIDEMIC. THERE IS AN EXPANSIVE EVIDENCE SPANNING DECADES THAT ONE SCHOOL START LATER TEENS GET MORE SLEEP. THEY ARE HEALTHIER THEY'RE HAPPIER THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE LESS LIKELY TO GET IN CAR ACCIDENTS THEIR ATTENDANCE GOES UP THEIR GRADES GO UP AND GRADUATIONS GROW UP. AND IN CALIFORNIA INCREASE ATTENDANCE MEANS INCREASED AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE FUNDS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS A 1% INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE IN THE LA U. S. THE WOULD INCREASE. TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THEN AS IF IT WERE NOT ENOUGH THE RAND CORPORATION PROJECTS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WILL GROW BY ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER GRADUATION RATES FEWER CAR ACCIDENTS FEWER DISCIPLINE BETTER PRODUCTIVITY WITH LATE START. AND EVERY YEAR THE EVIDENCE JUST KEEPS AMOUNTING. AFTER A RECENT STUDY OF THE SEATTLE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT A LARGER URBAN DISTRICT WHICH ADOPTED LATE START. CONFIRMS THE PREVIOUS FINDINGS WITH THE SHIFT TO LATER STARTS THEIR STUDENTS ARE GETTING MORE SLEEP GETTING BETTER GRADES AND ATTENDING SCHOOL MORE OFTEN ATTENDANCE IMPROVED THE MOST THAT SCHOOLS WITH THE MOST LOW INCOME STUDENTS LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. ATTENDANCE IMPROVED AT THE SCHOOLS WITH THE MOST LOW INCOME STUDENTS. STUDENT ATHLETES ARE ALSO A BIG BENEFICIARY I'M SURE SOMEBODY WHO WILL OPPOSE THIS BILL WILL MENTION THE IMPACT ON SPORTS AS A NEGATIVE. HEALTHY SCHOOL START TIME HAS WELL HELPS OUR ATHLETES. THEY GET HURT LESS AND THEY PARTICIPATE MORE -- IT'S JUST STAGGERING THE IMPACT AND AGAIN AS A PARENT. OF A STUDENT ATHLETE AND A PARENT WHO SEES OTHER KIDS WANTED TO PERFORM PERFORMANCE INCREASES AND INJURIES DECREASE. WE KNOW THAT HEALTHY SCHOOL HOURS WORK THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF WELL RUN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE NATION THAT THRIVE WITH LATER AGE APPROPRIATE START TIMES AT THEIR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS. THEY HAVE HEALTHIER AND SAFER STUDENTS AND SUCCESSFUL SPORTS PROGRAMS THE DATA AND EVIDENCE IS VERY CLEAR. EARLY MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL START TIMES POSE A PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK. TO OUR STATE YOU ARE USED DESERVE EQUAL PROTECTION FROM THAT HEALTH RISK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FREQUENTLY SETS HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE REVEALED THE DANGERS OF ASBESTOS LEAD SMOKING IN ON YOU MEAN I STUDENTS THE LEGISLATURE ACTED. TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN SO TO THAN THE LEGISLATURE. CAN AND SHOULD ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S SIX MILLION PUBLIC CHILDREN FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK OF DEVELPMENTALLY INAPPROPRIATE. EARLY SECONDARY SCHOOL START TIMES I'VE OFTEN BEEN ASKED WHY I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT. THIS PROPOSAL PEOPLE COME UP TO ME THEY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. IT BACK AGAIN YOU KEEP -- ON THIS AND YOU KNOW. I JUST READ TOO MANY STORIES IN TOO MANY PAPERS AND SEEN TO MANY FAMILIES OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. WHO HAVE TAKEN THEIR OWN LIFE? AND I DON'T WANT TO READ ANOTHER. ONE I JUST DON'T WANT TO READ ANOTHER ONE AND TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO AFFECT THE LIVES POSITIVELY OF THOSE KIDS -- I JUST CAN'T A GOOD CONSCIOUSNESS BRING THIS BACK TODAY I HAVE DR RAFEAL POLITE -- FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF SLEEP MEDICINE I HAVE JOY WAIT FROM THE SCORCHED START SCHOOL LATER IN HIGH SCHOOL PARENT ENGAGEMENT GROUP I KNOW THE PTA. IS HERE BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO EACH WITNESS HAS TWO MINUTES TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE PROCEED YOU CAN DECIDE WHO WANTS TO START [inaudible] ONE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS BILL. BEFORE ICE BEFORE I SAID I PLEDGE ACTUALLY WANT -- TO ADD TO THE HOSTAGES SENATOR WILL COULD JUST ACT OUT THANK OF WAS LEADERSHIP AND APOLOGIZE FOR LETTING MY PASSION GET THE BETTER OF ME THE LAST TIME WAS FOR HIS COMMITTEE -- ANYWAY I AM A PROFESSOR AND PHYSICIAN SPECIALIZING IS THE MEDICINE FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR AN INDISPUTABLE THAT ADOLESCENTS ARE SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC SLEEP DEPRIVATION WHICH IS CAUSING THEM HARM. SCIENCE TEACHES US LESSONS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO SLEEP DEPRIVATION BECAUSE THERE IS A BIOLOGICAL SHIFT IN THEIR BRAIN RHYTHMS THAT HEIGHTENS THEIR LIVES AT NIGHT WHICH FORCES THEM TO FALL ASLEEP LATER. THERE ARE DECADES OF PEER REVIEW DATA SHOWING THAT. THIS IS A WORSENING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL. HAVE YOU PUT A THAT INSUFFICIENT SLEEP AMONG STUDENTS HAS NOW INCREASED TO WELL OVER 70%. A RECENT REVIEW ENCOMPASSING NEARLY 600-100-0600 THOUSAND TEENAGERS FROM THE SLEEP DURATION IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR INDEPENDENT OF MOOD INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SUICIDALITY. THE LUIS SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR IS FIRST SAW STIPULATIONS OF EIGHT TO NINE HOURS. MOST TEENAGERS ARE LUCKY TO GET EVEN SEVEN HOURS ON SCHOOL NIGHTS. ONE FORTY FOR TEENAGERS SCHOOL START TO EARLY. THIS HAS LED TO VERY SERIOUS PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING DECREASE SCHOOL PERFORMANCE MEANT AND-MENTAL HEALTH ALONG WITH INCREASED CAR ACCIDENTS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE RESEARCH HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THE DELAYING THE SCHOOL START TIME AS IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF TEENAGERS. THE BIOLOGY OF THEIR STEEP CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE TREATED AS AN INCONVENIENCE. THE WAY TO THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS SO COMPELLING THE PROFESSIONAL HELP SOCIETY TO TAKE NOTICE. AMERICAN KENNY PEDIATRICS STANFORD PACKAGING HOSPITAL NURSING ORGANIZATIONS MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS CAN YOU SLEEP MEDICINE NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION. ON AND ON OF ALL AGREE TO STARTING SCHOOL LATER WILL IMPROVE. THEIR ALICE'S QUALITY OF LIFE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE PHYSICAL MENTAL HEALTH THERE ARE ZERO THERE ARE ZERO HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSING THIS BILL. NOW YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSLATE TO SITES IN TO SOME PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY AND SEND THE MESSAGE THAT WE ALUE THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN OVER ALL OF THE CONCERNS. ARE YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND THANK YOU FOR SERVING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT COMMITTEE. EVEN FOR KIDS WITH GOOD SLEEP HABITS EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES MANDATE THAT MOST TEENS WAKE UP AT TIMES THAT DOCTORS SAY INCREASE THE RISK FOR ILLNESS SUICIDE AND CAR ACCIDENTS. MANY CHILDREN SUFFER DAILY AND HAVE A WORSE QUALITY OF LIFE BECAUSE OF IT. I'M SURE WE ALL AGREE THAT CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND SAFETY THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. CURRENTLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE OPTION. OF GOING AGAINST ACCEPTED HEALTH AND MEDICAL EXPERTISE AND CONTINUING THE PRACTICE OF DEVELOPMENTALLY INAPPROPRIATE START TIMES FOR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN. WE DON'T BELIEVE PROTECTING CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND SAFETY SHOULD BE MERRILEES OPTIONAL. WE THINK ALL CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE INCOME OR RACE DESERVE EQUAL PROTECTION FROM KNOWN PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS. AND EARLY MIDDLE SCHOOL START TIMES ARE PARTICULARLY HARMFUL TO GIRLS WHO ENTER PUBERTY EARLIER THAN BOYS. DECADES OF EVIDENCE AND LIVED EXPERIENCE SHOW THAT EIGHT THIRTY AM OR LATER START TIMES WORK FOR FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE I'M SORRY ABOUT 20% OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ALREADY START AT EIGHT THIRTY OR LATER WITHOUT ISSUE. AND MORE FAMILIES ARE PROVEN TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL WITH EIGHT THIRTY OR LATER START TIME ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME FAMILIES. NORMALLY DEFERRING EDUCATIONAL ISSUES TO LOCAL CONTROL MAKES SENSE. BUT WITH THIS STATE WIDE PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM IT HAS NOT SERVE THE PUBLIC GOOD. ADOLESCENT SLEEP DEPRIVATION AS A PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC PRIMARILY CAUSED BY PUBLIC POLICY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT HEALTHY SCHOOL START TIMES WILL TAKE EFFORT. AND IN SOME CASES THEY'LL TAKE RESOURCES. BUT WE THINK THAT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF SIX MILLION CALIFORNIA CHILDREN IS WORTH THE EFFORT. MANY DISTRICTS NATIONWIDE HAVE PROVEN THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO HARM TEENS HEALTH AND SAFETY TO RUN AN EFFICIENT SCHOOL DISTRICT I HAVE A THRIVING EXTRACURRICULAR PROGRAM OR AN EFFICIENT. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT. AS ADULTS IS OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO PROTECT CHILDREN AND TODAY YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE POWER TO DO JUST THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

I'M HERE NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS OF IN THE THOMAS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT ALSO HERE TODAY. AS A SINGLE PARENT OF TWO TEENAGE KIDS ONE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND ONE IN HIGH SCHOOL. WHILE I AM NOT GOING TO DISPUTE THE SCIENCE I DON'T HAVE A PHD AND SLEEP SCIENCE AND I CERTAINLY CAN RELATE TO SLEEP DEPRIVATION AS MY STARBUCKS ADDICTION ADDICTION WILL ATTEST. MANDATING LATER START TIMES WILL CREATE AN INCREDIBLE HARDSHIP FOR SINGLE INCOME FAMILIES FOR WORKING CLASS FAMILIES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MY STUDENTS AND FROM MY KIDS PERSPECTIVE. BUT WHEN. REGARDLESS OF WHAT TIME MY KIDS SCHOOL STARTS I STILL HAVE TO GETTHEM TO SCHOOL BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I GET TO WORK ON TIME I HAVE A FULL TIME JOB. I'M A SINGLE PARENT AND AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IT'S A BALANCING ACT AND I STRUCK THAT BALANCE BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SCHOOL STARTED EIGHT EIGHT THIRTY NINE MY KIDS ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO GET UP AT THAT SAME TIME. THE DIFFERENCES INSTEAD OF BEING AN ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN AND I'M INTENT ON ATTENDED ENVIRONMENT THE NON STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT AND THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE GETTING UP IT WON'T ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT ARE LAUDABLE GOALS AND I SUPPORT THOSE GOALS. PLEASE ALLOW LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS THAT ARE IN TOUCH WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES THE TIME IS UNIFIED LIVE IN LOW INCOME. LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE AND QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH THESE ARE THE FAMILIES THAT THIS BILL WOULD HURT THE MOST BECAUSE THESE ARE THE ONES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES. WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE. TO SUPPORT GETTING THESE KIDS TO SCHOOL AT A LATER TIME AND STILL GET TO WORK ON TIME IN SUPPORT OF FAMILIES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CINDY GARDNER I'M FROM ANOTHER WORLD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SAMBAR NAY DINO. AS SUCH OUR ELEVATION OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT IS FROM WITH FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED FOOT LEVEL TO THE SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED FOOT LEVEL. OUR MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL ARE IN DEAD CENTER AT THE FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOL FIVE FOOT LEVEL HIGH SCHOOL STARTS AT SEVEN TEN IN THE MORNING. ELEMENTARY AT EIGHT TWENTY IN THE MORNING MIDDLE SCHOOL AT NINE TEN IN THE MORNING WE PLAYED AROUND WITH DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. RIGHT NOW THE BEST SCENARIO IS AT SEVEN TEN AM START TIME FOR ELEMENTARY THAT WOULD REQUIRE R. T. CARES OUR FOUR YEAR OLDS. TO GET TO A BUS STOP FOR PICK UP AT SIX THIRTY IN THE MORNING IN THE MID IN THE DARK IN THE SNOW IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER. WE'VE ALL THAT WOULD ALSO CREATE EIGHT NOT EIGHT THIRTY START TIME FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND THE MIDDLE SCHOOL WOULD START AT NINE THIRTY SO. ACTUALLY IT IN THE THE HIGH SCHOOL WOULD START AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL WOULD START AT TEN OO SEVEN THOSE KIDS THE LAST DROP OFF POINT WOULD BE SIX O'CLOCK AT NIGHT SO THINK ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE PRECLUDED -- FROM THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN AND THE NEXT THING IS IS THAT IF WE TRY TO DUPLICATE OR DOUBLE OUR BUSES TO GET EVERYBODY AT A DECENT START TIME. ITWOULD COST US THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS A ONE TIME ONE POINT THREE MILLION ON GOING. THAT WOULD PUSH US INTO INSOLVENCY SO TO COVER THESE EXPENSES WHAT WOULD IT REQUIRE. LAYING OFF TWELVE TEACHERS INCLUDING THE ENTIRE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT ONE ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL FOR COUNSELORS FIVE LIBRARIANS THREE TWO SECRETARIES IT WOULD REDUCE OR ELIMINATE. OUR VIRTUAL CREDIT RECOVERY PROGRAM WHICH HELPS OUR MOST -- ACADEMICALLY AT RISK KIDS WOULD ALSO HAVE TO CUT DRAMA BAND CHOIR AND MY FAVORITE ATHLETICS REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. WE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO CANCEL OUR TEXTBOOK ADOPTION. SO WE THINK THIS IS A LOCAL DECISION LOCAL CONTROL WHAT WORKS FOR BASS FOR US. OUR OUR START TIMES ARE IN LIKE SYBIL WE ARE PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO CONDENSE THE PICKUP TIMES BECAUSE LITERALLY OUR BUSES ARE PICKING CUT KIDS UP IN THE FARTHEST REACHES OF THE MOUNTAINS WE WORK WITH OUR C. H. B.. FOR THE MOST AFFECTED BUS ROUTES REMEMBER WE DON'T AVE SIDEWALKS SO OUR FOUR YEAR OLDS WHEN IT'S SNOWING AND THERE'S BERMS TEN TWENTY FEET HIGH IT'S SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED FOOT LEVEL AT SIX THIRTY IN THE MORNING. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE WE CAN ACCOMMODATE. THE START TIMES IN A CONDENSED FASHION. AND WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS IS ENCOURAGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL -- BELIEVING THAT ITS LOCAL DECISION MAKING THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS OPPOSING MADAM. IN OPPOSITION GO AHEAD MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS SOUTH BRAMBLE HERE O BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE COULD PROBABLY SUPPORT A PILOT PROGRAM WE ARE OPPOSED TO SENATE BILL.

IT FULLY RETIRED TEACHERS -- STRONGLY OPPOSED. THE INJURY SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. ANY FURTHER OPPOSITION. OKAY SEEING AND HEARING THEN I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BEFORE I ASK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR INPUT. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY INPUT. FIRST I WAS A YOUR RIGHT CENTER PORTANTINO I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS BILL. AND IT'S BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE I READ THE ENTIRE BOOK THAT YOU PRO PROVIDED US WITH I MADE MY OWN NOTES. AND WHILE THE MAJORITY OF IT DOES SUGGEST THAT SLEEP TIME IS SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. EVEN IN THIS REPORT THAT YOU GAVE US IT TALKS ABOUT ACADEMIC IMPROVEMENT IS ACTUALLY NOT STATISTICALLYSIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO LIST. IT TALKS ABOUT -- THERE'S MORE THAN JUST CHANGING START TIMES. THAT PARENTS NEED TO HELP THEIR KIDS GET MORE SLEEP THE PARENTS NEED TO TAKE THEIR KIDS OFF OF THEIR PHONES THAT KIDS PARENTS NEED. TO TAKE AWAY THE TELEVISION TIME SO. I APPRECIATE IT I READ IT. MY CONCERNS FOR THE BILL OUR ONE AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY. THAT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT ALREADY HAS THE RIGHT TO DO THIS EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN ALREADY DO THIS. AND I THINK THE EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT IS UNIQUE AND IN DOING RESEARCH ON THIS BILL WE FOUND THAT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS. STARTED A LATER START TIME. AND IT WORKED AND THEY LOVE IT IN THE CONTINUE AT OTHER STARTED IT IT DIDN'T WORK AND THEY WENT BACK. SO I THINK IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY THAT ONE SIZE FITS ALL. I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT TOM FROM ROOM OF WORLD. ABOUT THE SCHOOL BUSES WHEN YOU AND I MET I SHARED WITH YOU THAT MY OWN COUNTY OF SAMBAR TO DINO WOULD HAVE TO DUPLICATE THEIR BUSES TO A COST OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS. I JUST DON'T THINK THOSE ARE INSIGNIFICANT. I'M ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE WE HAVE TEACHERS STRIKING FOR SMALLER CLASS SIZES FOR COUNSELORS FOR NURSES SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE ARE FACING IN OUR OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM RIGHT NOW K. THROUGH. TWELVE AND I JUST WORRY THAT THIS IS NOT THE BEST THING TO DO AT THIS TIME I APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION -- I TO AGREE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY KIDS COMMIT SUICIDE. BUT I WORRIED THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO HAVE SO MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THEY WERE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES IN A WORSE POSITION. THAN WE'RE IN NOW SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CENTER CHIANG. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- SO I WAS IN NO ON THIS. ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR. AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR OF CONTACTING ME IN AND I LOOKED INTO IT MYSELF. I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF OF PHYSICIANS. I'VE TALKED TO A TON OF PARENTS ACTUALLY IN THE DISTRICT CONTACTED ME. AND ULTIMATELY AFTER REVIEWING THE RESEARCH I AM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE -- I'M WILLING TO TRY SOMETHING NEW FOR STUDENTS THE SCIENCE DOES SHOW THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN BENEFIT. FROM A LATER START TO THEIR SCHOOL DAYS AND I AM SUPPORTER OF THAT BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I DID -- I HEAR FROM OPPOSITION REGARDING THE LOCAL CONTROL ISSUES. AND I WOULD LIKE TO VISIT THIS AT A LATER DATE IF IT'S NOT WORKING BUT AT THIS POINT I AM WILLING TO TO GIVE THIS A CHANCE AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S PASSION SO TODAY WILL BE A SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER CHIANG OTHER DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND A BUT SO FIRST WIFE SAID THAT -- NO I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL BECAUSE THE THE DATA -- ON ON THIS ISSUE IS EXTREMELY STRONG -- AND THIS IS THIS IS A PEDIATRICIAN AND SOMEONE. TO SCIENTISTS AND CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT MANY OF THIS THERE'S A THERE'S A CAN DOWN THERE'S BASICALLY CONSENSUS AND AND THE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO LOOK AT PEDIATRICS AND DEVELOPMENT. AND SLEEP IN WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THEM HERE -- I RECOGNIZE FROM THE OPPOSITION I APPRECIATE I HAVE A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FROM MY OWN SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE WHO'S OPPOSED. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT I HEAR THE OPPOSITION AS WELL IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO DO THIS. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WILL BUT THERE THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES IN A BE HARD BUT WE TALK ABOUT AND BELIEVE ME I'M SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO SEE MORE SCHOOL NURSES PSYCHOLOGISTS SMALLER CLASS SIZE AND SO FORTH AND THOSE ARE GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT -- THAT WHAT WHY ARE WE TRYING TO GIVE OUR KIDS EVERY CHANCE AT SUCCESS. AND THE DATASHOWS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS. AND PART OF THE REASON FOR SAYING THAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO THIS ACROSS THE STATE YES PEOPLE ARE CHALLENGED WITH TRYING TO GET TO WORK WELL ACTUALLY IF EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE WAS DOING THIS. I THINK WE'LL SEE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN WORKPLACES BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S NOT JUST A COUPLE PARENTS WERE TRYING TO DO THIS. IT'S OUGHT TO PARENTS NEED TO WORK WITH THEIR CHILDREN AROUND A CHRONIC SINCE SCREENS YES THEY DO -- BU THE SAME TIME WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE WORKING AGAINST BIOLOGY WHEN WE SAY WELL IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO NEED TO TELL OUR KIDS THEY NEED TO GET UP EARLIER THAN THEIR SLEEP CYCLE THAT THE PROVIDENCE SHOWS WITH THE SLEEP CYCLE IS. SO -- WE HAVE TO THINK IS OUR SCHOOLS FOR STUDENTS OUR STUDENTS FOR SCHOOLS AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE FOR STUDENTS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT'S BEST FOR STUDENTS AND CERTAINLY I THINK THE DATA ON THIS IS IS IS COMPELLING. THAT -- THIS IS SOMETHING OUR STUDENTS NEED AND WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THEIR SYSTEMS WORK WITH THIS SO THAT WE'RE NOT WORKING AGAINST IT I MEAN WE CAN TRY TO GET MORE PSYCHOLOGIST WE CAN DO MORE SCHOOL NURSES WE CAN DO EVERYTHING ELSE BUT WARY WORKING AGAINST THE BIOLOGY. AND SO WITH THAT -- I'M STRONGLY -- NOW IS THAT I CAN GO OUT THERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I WOULD ACTUALLY MOVED TO BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IS TO MAKE A COMMENT. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION I MEAN YOU'VE NOT LET UP ON THIS ISSUE SINCE SINCE LAST YEAR AND I AGREE DOCTOR PAN AYE AYE. I FIND A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE -- COMPELLING GOT TO BALANCE THAT WITH LOCAL CONTROL WHICH IS SOMETHING I I STRONGLY BELIEVE AND BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS LAST WEEK IN THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU GAVE ME -- I AM GOING TO I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR IT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO IT'S A VERY POOR NATION NEED TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. I HAVE TO GO BACK AND AND RE MEET WITH MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE OPPOSED TO IT SO MOBILE FOR TODAY -- IF I GET A LOT OF PUSH BACK AT HOME I RESERVE THE RIGHT ON THE FLOOR TO DEVOTE THE OTHER WAY BUT LET ME OBVIOUSLY. IT SHOULD BE STUDENTS FIRST AND SO I WANNA GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT THOSE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES. AND IS EASY TO SAY NO BUT YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU GET TO YASSIN SO I'M GONNA GO BACK AND WORK ON THAT AND BE HAPPY BUT HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK YOU SIR WELL OKAY THING ELSE I JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS COMMITTEE ALSO KNOWS THAT I OFFERED AN AMENDMENT TO CENTER PORTANTINO WHICH SHE WAS NOT WILLING TO TAKE. BECAUSE THE SCIENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT LATE TEENS THAT IT WORKS BEST FOR PEOPLE IN THEIR LATE TEENS AND EARLY TWENTIES WHICH MAKES IT RIGHT FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND I ASKED HIM TO EXEMPT. MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR HIGHS SO THAT WAY IT WOULD MAKE IT WOULD EASE SOME OF THE TRANSPORTATION -- ISSUES. AND YOU DO NOT WANT TAKE OUT SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU COUNTER BACK WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT -- WAS THE WASN'T FEASIBLE MY MIND SO I DO FEEL LIKE WE'VE TRIED TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE -- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND I JUST WISH THAT IT WE CAN WAVE A MAGIC WAND AND MAKE IT EASY FOR EVERYONE. AND RESPECTFULLY -- DOCTOR PAN -- WORKING WITH CORPORATE AMERICA FOR MANY YEARS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT I DON'T THINK MOST WORK PLACES WILL JUST THEIR TIME FOR SCHOOLS I NEVER SAW THAT HAPPEN. SO WITH THAT -- CENTER POINT TWO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I I WOULD IN -- YES -- I I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT AND THE ANALYSIS DOES THE YOU -- OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXEMPT OUT MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND I AND I BELIEVE I CAME UP. LET ME BACK UP I THINK THAT. THE CONCERN YOU HAD IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN ABOUT GIVING DISTRICTS FLEXIBILITY TO TO STAGGER -- THEIR BUS SCHEDULE AND YOU KNOW I I BELIEVE ACTUALLY IF WE MADE MIDDLE AND MIDDLE SCHOOL SINGING AND JUNIOR HIGHS. HAVE A MINIMUM STANDARD OF EIGHT O'CLOCK IN HIGH SCHOOLS EIGHT THIRTY I THINK. THAT ACCOMPLISHES THAT GOAL THAT I WAS WILLING TO TO GO THERE AND I STILL LAUGH AND CONSIDERING THAT AMENDMENT AS THIS HOPEFULLY BILL MOVES OUT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A A LEGITIMATE QUESTION ASK THOUGH. FRANKLY THE DATA DOESN'T SHOW THAT THE TRANSPORTATION CROSS DO INCREASE -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW I DO APPRECIATE DR PANS CO AUTHORSHIP IN LEADERSHIP ON THIS IS A PEDIATRICIAN -- THE DATA IS CLEAR AND FRANKLY THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE IMPLEMENTATION ARE POSITIVE - AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FOLLOW IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW WE HAVE. A WAY TO POSITIVELY AFFECT PUBLIC HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE -- A FORMER PRESIDENT -- WHO WAS A GOVERNOR ONCE SAID THAT -- HIS BIGGEST FRUSTRATION WITH EDUCATION. WAS THAT EVERY PROBLEM IN EDUCATION HAS BEEN SOLVED ON A CAMPUS SOMEWHERE. AND THE GOVERNOR WAS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE WAS DUPLICATING THAT SUCCESS BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT MAKES THINGS WORK ON A PARTICULAR CAMPUS. ARE THE ART OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND IT'S HARD TO DUPLICATE. THAT PART -- AND WHAT MAKES ME EXCITED ABOUT LATE START IS THS IS A REPLICABLE DUPLICATE BOWL. PROVEN WAY TO IMPROVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IT'S NOT ANECDOTE -- IT'S NOT THEORY IT'S BORNE OUT BY DISTRICT AFTER DISTRICT ARE URBAN DISTRICTS SMALL DISTRICT -- AND THE DATA SHOWS IT WORKS -- I DO WANT TO COMMENT AGAIN ON THE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME. CHILDREN AND WORKING FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS -- AGAIN THE DATA SHOWS THAT THEY SEE THE BIGGEST BENEFIT -- AFTER THE CHANGE IN WITH THE SEATTLE MODEL WE KNOW THAT ATTENDANCE ACTUALLY INCREASED. DIDN'T DECREASE SO WHAT IS BEING USED AS A NEGATIVE IS ACTUALLY A POSITIVE FOR THE BILL IN A FIGHT. COULD CLOSE WITH COMMENTS FROM A UNIVERSITY BERKELEY -- PROFESSOR AND HE WROTE I WRITE WITH DEEPEST SINCERITY IMPLORING YOU TO SUPPORT. THE BILL TO DELAY SCHOOL START TIMES THE SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY DATA ARE UNEQUIVOCAL BULL. AS HE DESCRIBES BELOW IN HIS LETTER THIS BILL IS A MISSION CRITICAL TO GIVING ADOLESCENCE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO SLEEP THEY NEED. A MATTER WHAT PARENTS DO OR HOW MUCH THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP IS COMMUNICATED MOST TEENS SIMPLY CANNOT GET ENOUGH SLEEP. WITH EARLY START TIME AND HE CONCLUDED HIS LETTER. WITH -- THIS IS A LETTER SENT LAST YEAR. AS YOU CAN SEE THE SCIENTIFIC MEASURABLE SLEEP DEFICIENCY IS SO DISASSOCIATED WITH EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES RESULTS IN MARKED. MENTAL PHYSICAL AN ACADEMIC DAMAGE HIS WORDS NOT MINE IF OUR GOAL AS EDUCATORS TRULY IS TO EDUCATE AND NOT RISK THE LIVES IN THE PROCESS. THEN I FEAR WE ARE FAILING OUR NEXT GENERATION WITH UNSUSTAINABLE MODELS OF EARLY SCHOOL START TIME AND THAT WAS SIGNED BY. MATTHEW WALKER PHD PROFESSOR OF NEUROSCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY DIRECTOR CENTER FOR HUMAN SLEEP SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SO WE'VE UNITED BOTH STANFORD PROFESSORS AND CAL PROFESSORS -- IN SUPPORT AND I THINK FOR THAT ALONE. WE SHOULD GET AN AYE VOTE AND SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR AN AYE VOTE AND APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES I CERTAINLY WILL. WORK WITH SENATOR WOKE AND SENATOR CHIANG AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH DR PAN AND CERTAINLY WITH THE CHAIR AS WELL -- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE. WE HAVE A MOTION I THINK BY SENATOR PAN THANK YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN MEMBERS -- BUT IT WILL BEGIN BY THANKING YOU AND STAFF FOR PROPOSING OF IMPORTANT MOMENTS WHICH WE DO ACCEPT. I THINK THEY IMPROVE THE BILL OF THE THE MATTER BEFORE YOU CONCERNED SCHOOL SAFETY AND CONCERNS TRAINING. OF EMPLOYEES SCHOOL SECURITY OFFICERS -- WHO ARE? WORKING IN SCHOOL DISTRICT AS EMPLOYEES BUT NOT WORKING TWENTY HOURS OR MORE AND THE PURPOSE OF THE BILLS TO ENSURE THAT ALL SCHOOL SAFETY PLEASE ARE ADEQUATELY TRAINED TO DEAL WITH GIRLS SCHOOL EMERGENCIES. I I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS IN THIS DAY AND AGE IN WITH THE THE SAD EVENTS THAT OCCURRED ON SEVERAL CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES -- WHAT THIS DOES IS IT REQUIRES THAT ALL SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ARE RECEIVING CERTAIN TRAINING OF THE COST IS RELATIVELY SMALL? BUT THE BENEFIT IS HUGE. SO WITH THAT -- MADAM CHAIR LIKE TO INTRODUCE A SANDRA BORRERO LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WHO'S WITH ME HERE TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER OF BURKE AND I WILL LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT WE HAVE SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES PLEASE PROCEED.

LEAVE THAT PHOTO THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY -- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO SB TWENTY FOUR BY SENATOR LEYVA. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITES DIRECTLY FROM HIM. A LITTLE OF THE REST OF THE WORLD [inaudible] WHICH IS [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER A CHAIR GLAZER GOOD MORNING. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THIS AMAZING COMMITTEE FOR THERE ARE HARD WORK ON THIS BILL GREATLY APPRECIATED. MEMBERS AS YOU MAY REMEMBER SEVERAL OF YOU SAW A SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR SB. THREE TWENTY UNFORTUNATELY AFTER PASSING BOTH HOUSES FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN VETO THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. SITTING AT THE TIME THAT STUDENTS HAVING TO TRAVEL A GOOD DISTANCE OFF CAMPUS. TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION IS NOT IN HIS WORDS UNREASONABLE. AS A WOMAN AND AS A LEGISLATOR THAT STRONGLY BELIEVES IN EACH OF OUR ABILITY TO MAKE OUR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT OUR LIVES. AND ABOUT OUR HEALTH CARE I RESPECTFULLY AND PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE WITH OUR FORMER GOVERNOR. AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE THAT I WILL NOT REST UNTIL IT BECOMES LAW. MEMBERS SB TWENTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE ALL ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CARE CENTERS AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO OFFER MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS TO STUDENTS BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THREE A RECENT REPORT BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT OVER THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION WOMEN. IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE USED MEDICATED ABORTION. AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WOMEN AGE TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR ACCOUNTED 434% OF ABORTIONS THE LARGEST FOR ANY AGE GROUP THIS OF COURSE INCLUDES UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE STUDENTS. MEDICATION ABORTION IS A TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE A PATIENT TAKES TWO SETS OF PILLS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS. IT IS FDA APPROVED TO USE FOR UP TO TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. ACCORDING TO A UC SAN FRANCISCO STUDY MEDICATION ABORTION IS VERY SAFE WITH COMPLICATIONS OCCURRING IN ONLY ZERO POINT 3% OF CASES. WHICH IS MUCH SAFER THAN MANY MEDICATIONS SOMEONE CAN BUY OVER THE COUNTER. IN A MOMENT YOU WILL HEAR MORE FROM DOCTOR DANIEL GROSSMAN A CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHER ON ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION WHO WILL FURTHER DISCUSS SOME OF THIS IMPORTANT RESEARCH. THOUGH MANY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUCH AS PREGNANCY OPTIONS COUNSELING AND CONTRACEPTIVES NONECURRENTLY OFFER ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS. MEDICATION ABORTION IS A SAFE PROCEDURE AND IS CLINICALLY SIMPLER THAN MUCH OF THE CARE ALREADY OFFERED AT COLLEGE COLLEGE HEALTH CENTERS. SUCH AS DIABETES MANAGEMENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. IF A STUDENT HAS GO OFF CAMPUS. ON TO AN OFF CAMPUS PROVIDER THAT DOES NOT ACCEPT THEIR STUDENT OR OTHER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PAYING FOR MEDICATION ABORTION MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN. IN TOTAL TWENTY TWO UC AND CSU CAMPUSES ARE MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES AWAY FROM THE CLOSEST ABORTION PROVIDER VIA PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. MEDICATION ABORTION REQUIRES TWO TRIPS TO HEALTH CLINIC WHICH COULD MEAN TWO HOURS OF TOTAL TRAVEL TIME FOR THE STUDENTS AND UP TO FOUR HOURS FARTHER AWAY FROM CAMPUSES. THESE BARRIERS ARE WORSENED SINCE ONLY 15% OF THE CLOSEST OFF CAMPUS ABORTION PROVIDERS ARE OPEN ON WEEKENDS MEANING THAT STUDENTS MAY HAVE TO MISS CLASSES EXAMS. AND WORK TO ACCESS ABORTION WHICH IS THE SUPREME THE SUPREME COURT HAS DETERMINED TO BE A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT. BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTIONON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IS CRITICAL SINCE WOMEN MUST RECEIVE THIS CARE WITHIN THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE PREGNANT UNTIL THE FIFTH OR SIXTH WEEK OF PREGNANCY. MEMBERS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS NOT A SLOGAN BUT RATHER A COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING TRUE ACCESS TO ABORTION FOR CALIFORNIANS ACROSS OUR STATE INCLUDING COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS DOCTOR DANIEL CRESSMAN PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS. AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AT UC SAN FRANCISCO AND JESSE WAS ALL IS A RECENT UC RIVERSIDE GRADUATE -- GET YOUR FIRST WITNESS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY -- AS CENTER LEYVA SAID I'M A PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AT UCSF AND I DIRECTOR POLICY ORIENTED RESEARCH PROGRAM. CALLED ANSWER ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WE PUBLISH TWO STUDIES IN THE PEER REVIEWED LITERATURE RELATED TO SB. TWENTY FOUR THE FIRST LOOKED AT HOW STUDENTS -- HOW OFTEN STUDENTS SEEK ABORTION CARE AND WHETHER THEY FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS STUDENTS ACROSS THE UC AND CSU CAMPUSES OBTAIN APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND ABORTIONS EACH MONTH? AND WE ESTIMATE THAT AS MANY AS FIVE HUNDRED MEDICATION ABORTIONS WOULD BE PROVIDED MONTHLY ON CAMPUS IF STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS OFFERED THE SERVICE. ACROSS ALL PUBLIC UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES CONSIDERING THAT THE SERVICE REQUIRES TWO VISITS THE MEDIAN TIME BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT ON TO THE CLOSEST PROVIDERS TWO HOURS ROUND TRIP FOR MEDICATION ABORTION. AND UP TO FOUR HOURS FOR SOME CAMPUSES ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS TRAVELING MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES FOR HEALTH CARE RENDERS THAT CARE IN ACCESSIBLE. FOR THE SECOND STUDY WE STUDY THE CAPACITY OF STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS TO PROVIDE MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS AND WHAT THEY WOULD NEED. ALL THE UC AND CSU STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES THE EMPLOYER CONTRACT WITH AT LEAST ONE PHYSICIAN ON HAND OR A AN ADVANCED PRACTICE CLINICIAN -- AND THEY ALL HAVE THE NEEDED PHYSICAL SPACE. IN ORDER TO OFFER THE SERVICE THEY WOULD ALL NEED TRAINING ON THE ULTRASOUND IF THAT'S NEEDED -- AND THEY WOULD ALSO NEED TWENTY FOUR HOUR TELEPHONE SUPPORT TO TRIAGE PATIENTS IF THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE THAT. GIVEN THESE FINDINGS I BELIEVE THAT ABORTION KAREN CAMPUS IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND DECREASED BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WITH THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN COMMITTED IT WOULD BE VERY FEASIBLE. TO OFFER MEDICATION ABORTION AT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS THERE'S NO REASON TO EXCLUDE MEDICATION ABORTION CARE FROM THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. AS SENATOR LABOR NOTED MEDICATION ABORTION IS SAFE AND SIMPLE TO PROVIDE OVER THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION U. S. WOMEN HAVE HAD A MEDICATION ABORTION AND SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS ARE VERY RARE. IN FACT THE HEALTH RISKS ARE ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO CONTINUE A PREGNANCY TO TERM -- COMPARED TO THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO HAVE A MEDICATION ABORTION. JUST TWO WEEKS AGO -- THE FDA APPROVED A NEW GENERIC FORM OF MIFEPRISTONE WHICH IS THE MEDICATION HOUSTON MEDIC AND MEDICATION PORTION. FURTHER CONFIRMING THE AGENCY'S VIEW THAT THIS IS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. YOU SEE AN CSU STUDENTS ARE ALREADY OBTAINING MEDICATION ABORTIONS IN THE RARE CASE OF A COMPLICATION SOME MAY SEE CARE AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER RATHER THAN TRAVELING TO THE CLINIC WHERE THEY OBTAINED THE TREATMENT. IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING ACCESS FOR THE SEARCH FOR STUDENTS I BELIEVE THIS BILL WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. BY PROVIDING TRAINING ON HOW TO MANAGE THESE COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING FACILITY FACILITATING TIMELY REFERRALS WHEN NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THAT TEST SECOND BEFORE THE SECOND WHEN THIS UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE REAL CHAIR. AT TEN MINUTES EACH THAT WAS TWO TWENTY FOUR SO YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND ABOUT FORTY SECONDS FOR THE NEXT WITNESS SO WELCOME. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS JESSE -- SALAS AND I AM A UC RIVERSIDE GRADUATE CLASS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND CAMPUS COORDINATOR WITH THE JUST CARE CAMPAIGN AT THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA. THE JUST CARE CAMPAIGN MOBILIZES STUDENTS TO EXPAND REPRODUCTIVE EQUITY ON CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. THIS INCLUDES LIFTING BARRIERS TO ABORTION CARE. SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR IS DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ME. EVERY MONTH AS DOCTOR CROSSMAN ALREADY SHARED HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR CAMPUSES FOR ABORTION CARE THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ON AN ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. JUST TWO YEARS AGO I WAS ONE OF THE STUDENTS. IN MY THIRD YEAR AT UC RIVERSIDE I DISCOVERED I WAS PREGNANT. AS MY DOCTOR I WESTERN HEALTH CENTER WENT OVER MY OPTIONS I KNEW I WANTED TO GET AN ABORTION. BECAUSE I CAN GET MY ABORTION AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. I WAS FORCED TO NAVIGATE CUMBERSOME CONFUSING REFERRALS TO OFFSITE CLINICS THAT ULTIMATELY CAME INCREASINGLY MORE. IT DIFFICULT TO LIVE MY LIFE AND NOT STRESSED BECAUSE BY THE THREE MONTH DELAY IN CARE RESULTED ME IN FAILING THAT ENTIRE FALL QUARTER. AS A WOMAN OF COLOR CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS TRYING TO ACCESS MY ABORTION I FACE MORE BARRIERS THAN I EVER ANTICIPATED. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO NAVIGATE THE MEDICAL SYSTEM OR INSURANCE POLICIES. I DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GET THE CARE I NEEDED OFF CAMPUS SUCH AS MONEY AND A CAR. ONCE A STUDENT HAS DECIDED TO END A PREGNANCY THEY SHOULDN'T BE FORCED TO GO OFF CAMPUS TO SEE A PROVIDER THEY DON'T KNOW -- WHEN CARE CAN EASILY BE PROVIDED ON CAMPUS? LEAVING CAMPUS CAN MEANS TAKING TIME AWAY FROM CLASS AN INTERNSHIP FAMILY TIME OR YOUR JOB. IT CAN BE HARD TO RAISE THE MONEY OR FIND RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION TO A FAR AWAY CLINIC. OFFERING ABORTION KAREN CAMPUS HELPS ENSURE THESE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS WHO MIGHT NEED THEM. AND IS IMPORTANT AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING TRUE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND EQUITY FOR CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WAS FOUR THIRTY THREE AND WE'LL GET THE THE OPPOSING SIDE IF THERE IS ANY THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT IT'S THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TO COME UP TO THE MIKE.

IS NOT ABOUT -- PRO CHOICE WE ARE PRO CHOICE SO -- WE WORK WE'RE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES GOING FORWARD -- BUT WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE SCALE AT THIS TIME OKAY ALL RIGHT THANKS FOR SHARING THAT. AND THAT IS ON THE RECORD SO I KNOW WE HAVE FOLKS THAT -- ONE A LINE UP TO THE MICROPHONE IS THERE ANY -- SAY AGAIN YEAH. IF YOU IF YOU'RE PART OF THE ORGANIZED OPPOSITION WE'RE GONNA ALLOW AGAIN TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH AT THE UP HERE AT THE AT THE TABLE SO THERE'S ROOM -- IF YOU HAVE THREE WITNESSES YOU CAN DIVIDE YOUR TIME BUT ACTUALLY IT'S FOR THE FOUR MINUTES AND THIRTY THREE SECONDS TO BE FAIR SO I WILL. I'LL KEEP TRACK OF THAT I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE ORGANIZED IN TERMS OF WHO GOES FIRST. BUT IF YOU COULD IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND BEGIN AT USE AS YOU SEE FIT. HI MY NAME IS TO MICAH BASSMAN OCCURRENCE TO UC BERKELEY A MUCH WHILE YOU KNOW THEM HERE TO OPPOSE THE BILL AND OPEN ASK ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE FOR ME BY MY YOU'LL MY TWO MINUTES TO MY COLLEAGUE KRISTIN. OKAY TURNOUT. ADDRESS MY CONCERNS SB TWENTY FOUR A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH -- THAT TRANSFORMS LIFE AFFIRMING ON CAMPUS HEALTH CENTERS INTO ABORTION VENDORS I AM CHRISTIAN HAWKINS ON THE PRESENT OF STUDENTS FOR LIFE OF AMERICA. WE CURRENTLY SERVE MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED STUDENTS FOR LIFE GROUPS ON COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES IN ALL FIFTY STATES INCLUDING MORE THAN NINETY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS POLLS SHOW WE REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF OUR GENERATION REJECTS THE VIOLENT DESTRUCTION THAT IS ABORTION WE ENVISION A NATION WHERE NO STUDENT IS EVER FORCED. TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HER EDUCATION AND HER CHILD -- WE BELIEVE WOMEN AND STUDENTS SHOULD BE GIVEN ALL THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED ON CAMPUSES. FOR THEMSELVES OF THEIR FAMILY THROUGH TITLE NINE ENFORCEMENT EVEN OUROWN PREGNANT ON CAMPUS PROGRAM. IS ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS I COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ASKING FOR NOVO ON THIS MEASURE A MASSIVE DISTRACTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF OUR UNIVERSITIES THE TO EDUCATE FUTURE PROFESSIONALS AND LEADERS OF OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. BY DESIGN SB TWENTY FOUR WILL CREATE CHAOS INCREASE LEGAL LIABILITY FOR SCHOOLS AND POTENTIAL LOSS OF STUDENT LIFE AS WELL AS ESTABLISH A POTENTIALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROGRAM. BY LEADING THE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF BOTH STUDENTS AND UNIVERSITY HEALTH CENTER PERSONNEL. APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS OF THE LIABILITY CERTAIN TO COME TO CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL HAS YET TO BE MADE. THE COST OF RETOOLING CAMPUS HEALTH CENTERS INTO ABORTION FACILITIES INCLUDING PREPARING FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIOS OF YOUNG WOMEN HEMORRHAGING AND LEADING OUT IN THEIR DORM ROOMS ARE ON THE COMMUNAL BATHROOM TOILET. HAVE YET TO BEEN TOTALED RATHER THAN JUST BEING A SIMPLE DRUG PRESCRIBED TO RELIEVE A MY GREEN OR HEADACHE THE DISTRIBUTION OF ARE YOU FORTY SIX MUST BE HANDLED UNDER STRICT MEDICAL SUPERVISION AS CONDITIONS LIKE AB ATOMIC PREGNANCY. AN UNDETERMINED LEADER PREGNANCY CAN BE FATAL THE FDA UPDATED THEIR ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THIS COCKTAIL EARLIER THIS MONTH. I DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE REPORTED THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR DEATHS OF WOMEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONG. AS WELL AS FORTY TWO HUNDRED REPORTED ADVERSE AFFECTS INCLUDING SEVERAL CASES OF SEVERE SYSTEMIC INFECTION THAT WERE FATAL. WHEN THE ABORTION DRUG COCKTAIL FAILS AS IT DOES 10% OF THE TIME SURGICAL ABORTION IS THE NEXT STEP? THE QUESTION IS ARE CALIFORNIANS INTERESTED AND OUTFITTING CAMPUS HEALTH CENTERS TO BECOME SURGICAL AORTION FACILITIES WITH THE COMPENSATED PERSONALITY EXTENSIVE EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT. UNLIKE SURGICAL ABORTION WHICH IS DONE IN OUR PATIENTS ADDITION WHERE THE PATIENT IS CLOSELY MONITORED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING DISMEMBERMENT OF THE CHILD WITHIN HER. THE ARE YOU FORTY SIX ABORTION HAPPENS WHEN SHE IS ALONE IN HER JOURNAL DORM ROOM OR IN HER COMMUNITY BATHROOM. ANY WOMAN WHO'S EXPERIENCED A MISCARRIAGE WONDERSTONE AND THE PAIN IS UNBEARABLE AT TIMES BUT INSTEAD OF BEING RUSSIAN EMERGENCY ROOM FOR SUPPORT MEDICAL MONITORING AND PAIN RELIEF. SHE IS TOLD TO REMAIN WHERE SHE IS AT THE BLEEDING BECOMES TOO HEAVY TO SIT ON THE TOILET NOT LOOK DOWN AND FLUSH. AND GIVEN THAT BOTH THE UC AND CSU HEALTH PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED THROUGH STUDENT FEES IS NOT JUST POSSIBLE BUT LIKELY THAT STUDENTS LOW INCOME STUDENTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE PAYING FOR THEIR CLASSMATES ABORTIONS. FURTHER NO PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS PROPOSAL TO PROTECT THE CONSCIENCE RIGHT TO STUDENTS OR HEALTH CENTER PERSONNEL WHO DON'T WANT TO FIND TOILET BOWL ABORTIONS. CONSIDERING THE EXPENSE OF LOS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE FLOW OF THE WAS SERRA WHEN THE SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT THE STATE CANNOT COMPEL PRO LIFERS. TO SERVE AS SALES TEAMS FOR ABORTIONS. ONE CAN EQUALLY PRESUME THAT THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FORCES PEOPLE TO PAY FOR AND PARTICIPATE IN THESE CHEMICAL ABORTIONS ON CAMPUS. IT'S CONTROVERSIAL BILLS BEING FORCED FOR DESPITE THE FACT THAT ABORTION IS AVAILABLE WITHIN FIVE TO SEVEN MILES OF EVERY SINGLE COLLEGE CAMPUS IN THE STATE A FACT THAT THE FORME PRO CHOICE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA JERRY BROWN. NOTED LAST YEAR. THERE IS NO EDUCATIONAL REASON TO EXPOSE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS TO SUCH A RISK AND LIABILITY IT TAXPAYERS AND STUDENT EXPENSE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF OTHER AVAILABLE TURN TIPS WE HAVE. OKAY A DORM ROOM A COMMUNAL BATHROOM TOILET IS NO PLACE TO EXERCISE THE POWER CHOICE I ASK YOU TODAY TO REJECT THIS RISKY COSTLY AND DANGEROUS PROPOSAL OKAY THANK YOU SO THAT HAS USED UP ALL THE TIME IF YOU WANT TO GIVE A SUMMARY. COMMENT SHORT I'LL GIVE YOU THAT OPPORTUNITY OTHERWISE YOU GUYS ARE ALL TOGETHER YES OKAY THEN YOUR TIME HAS BEEN COMPLETED. WELCOME TO YOUR THE OTHER MICROPHONE AND AND AND ANNOUNCE YOUR OPPOSITION IF YOU WISH OKAY SO -- THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE. TO SHARE THEIR OPPOSITION IF YOU GO TO THE MICROPHONE INDICATE YOUR NAME.

ELABORATE ON ONE OF THE INACCURACIES -- THAT WAS STATED THAT 10% OF THE TIME A MEDICATION ABORTION FAILS I BELIEVE THAT IS INACCURATE. IF YOU COULD EXPAND ON THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA YES THAT'S INCORRECT ACCORDING TO THE FDA APPROVED LABELING FOR MIFEPRISTONE THAT REVIEWED ALL OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE FROM UNITED STATES.

WE'LL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO CAME OUT TODAY FULL SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION OKAY. IF YOU COULD -- EXIT THE ROOM -- QUIETLY OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. NEXT UP IS ITEM FIVE SP ONE SEVENTY FOUR BY CENTER LEYVA WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS CENTER-LLEVO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK OUR GREAT COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HELPING ME WITH THIS BILL AND MAKING IT. EVEN BETTER. SENATE BILL ONE SEVENTY FOR THE CHILD CARE STABILIZATION FORMULA WOULD ESTABLISH A SINGLE REGIONAL EYES STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE. FOR CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL AND EARLY LEARNING SERVICES. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES SERVICES FOR THESE CHILDREN SPECIFICALLY IT HAS TWO DIFFERENT UNALIGNED SYSTEMS FOR REIMBURSING PROVIDERS. THAT MEET TWO DIFFERENT STANDARDS THIS BIFURCATED SYSTEM RATE SYSTEM AND IN ADEQUATE RATE REIMBURSEMENTS COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO FUND AND DELIVER HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE. AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN. WELL ALSO. ADDRESSING THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THE CHILDREN BEING SERVED. THIS UNALIGNED TO SYSTEM APPROACH LIMITS ACCESS BILLS TO MAXIMIZE PROGRAM QUALITY AND IS FORCING MANY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS OUT OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE CURRENT RATE SYSTEM RESOURCES EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE STREAMLINED AND EXPENDED IN A WAY THAT ONE COMPENSATES TEACHERS AND PROGRAMS FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE. TO ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THREE RECOGNIZE THE COST OF MEETING VARYING QUALITY MEET STANDARDS. AND FOR INCENTIVIZE HIGH STANDARDS AND PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH BASED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN JUST ONE IN NINE CHILDREN ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CARE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY RECEIVE SERVICES. IN ORDER TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CHILDCARE WE MUST INVEST IN OUR WORK FORCE CALIFORNIA IS A DIVERSE STATE WITH THE FIRST CHILD CARE NEEDS. OUR STATE IS STRENGTHENED BY ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE PARENTS WITH A CHOICE. WHEN IT COMES TO SELECTING THE EARLY LEARNING EXPERIENCES THAT ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES? THROUGH THESE REFORMS CALIFORNIA CAN ACHIEVE A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND IN SUPPORT IS ERIN GABLE WITH FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA AND ON THE SNEERING SHIRT WITH CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. LADIES RIGHT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY RUNNING AHEAD OF SCHEDULE OR NOT -- BUT RULES ARE. RULES ARE TWO MINUTES PER SPEAKER. THANK YOU GO AHEAD AND I WILL DO MY BEST. TO STICK WITHIN THE PARAMETERS I'M I'M DONNA SALINGER I'M WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER WHERE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES THE LOS ANGELES AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN MANY MANY YEARS OF WORK IN OUR FIELD TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO UNIFY OUR REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM. AND I WAS PLEASED TO BE ONE OF THE CO CHAIRS ALONG WITH THE ABILITY OF AN EIGHTEEN MONTH STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER WHAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED -- THIS CURRENT SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA'S BIFURCATED AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY OF CHILD CARE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGE TO MOVE US ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION IT'S GOING TO TAKE MANY YEARS FOR US TO GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS. BUT WE BELIEVE BY PUTTING THIS POLICY FRAMEWORK IN PLACE IT'S GOING TO ALLOW US TO CREATE ASINGLE LATTICE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. THAT COMPENSATES PROVIDERS BASED ON THEIR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS AND ALLOWS THE STATE TO MAKE WISE INVESTMENTS TOWARD IMPROVING OUR STANDARDS OVERALL OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. IT REALLY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR UNIFICATION IN OUR INDUSTRY WE'VE SPENT MANY YEARS FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER OVER WHO GETS WHICH PIECE OF THE PIE AND IT'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY WE BELIEVE. TO BE LINK ARMS AND MOVE FORWARD AS A UNIFIED SYSTEM SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION WE APPRECIATE SENATOR IT LEVELS LEADERSHIP. AND ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] HI. HEARING ABLE TO HAVE A FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA YOUR STATE COMMISSION EARLY CHILDHOOD. AND AS YOU JUST HEARD FOR MY CALL FOR MY COLLEAGUE CALIFORNIA HAS A BIFURCATED REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM. AND THE FIRST GRAPHIC YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A VERY SIMPLISTIC RIGHT A REPRESENTATION OF HOW THIS ON LINE SYSTEM. OF RATES CURRENTLY WORKS AND I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH HOW WE PLAN TO REVISE THOSE RATES AND BRING THEM TOGETHER. IT'S KEY TO REMEMBER THAT THE LICENSED OR IN MARIN OR REGIONAL MARKET RATE FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET TITLE TWENTY TWO HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. AND THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE PROGRAMS THE S. R. ARE REQUIRED TO MEET ADDITIONAL TITLE FIVE CHILD DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS THAT CARRY GREAT INCREASED COSTS. THE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ADDITIONAL TITLE FIVE REQUIREMENTS ARE LOWER ADULT TO CHILD RATIOS INCREASE TO STAFF EDUCATION TRAINING FACILITY AND OTHER CHILD ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS. SHORTCOMINGS IN THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE ALSO EXIST MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SYSTEM RELIES ON HISTORIC SNAPSHOT APPROACH WHICH IS ALMOST THREE YEARS OLD BEFORE THE NEW SNAPSHOT IS AVAILABLE. IT'S A MAJOR COST OF BUSINESS CHANGES LIKE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND COST OF HEALTH CARE NEVER REFLECTED FOR YEARS. THE SURVEYS ALSO ALLOWED TO CAPTURE MARKET FAILURE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN DEEP POVERTY COMMUNITIES CAN ONLY CHARGE WITH THEIR MARKET WHICH IS THEIR NEIGHBORS CAN AFFORD TO PAY. THIS MARKET FAILURE IS AVERAGED INTO THE SURVEY'S RESULTS. SO AB. SB ONE SEVEN FOUR PROPOSES A SINGLE REGIONAL ICED REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM FOR CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL AND EARLY LEARNING SERVICES THAT ONE COMPENSATES ALL TEACHERS AND PROVIDERS FOR THE TRUE COST OF PROVIDING CARE. TO RECOGNIZE IS THE COST OF MEETING EXISTING VARYING QUALITY STANDARDS THE STATE HAS PUT INTO PLACE IN ORDER TO DRIVE CHILD OUTCOMES AND SAFETY. AND THREE STABILIZES THE ABILITY OF THE STATE'S MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM TO PROVIDE QUALITY EARLY LEARNING OPTIONS WE ARE CALLING IT THE CHILD CARE STABILIZATION FORMULA. THE SINGLE REGIONALI STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SERVICES WOULD HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM IS MAINTAINED AS ONE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE SYSTEM. SERVING VARIOUS PROGRAM MISSIONS FUNDING ADEQUATELY TO ACHIEVE THEIR SHARED MISSION TO SUPPORTING WORKING PARENTS AND THRIVING CHILDREN BUT MEETING THE STANDARD SO THEY ARE REQUIRED TO MEET. AND SIGNIFICANTLY WE CAN LIKE WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA CREATE A FORMULA FOR CHILD CARE. THAT IS THE DRIVER FOR THE CHILD AND SYSTEM OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT. THE SECOND GRAPHIC YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A VERY SIMPLE DEPICTION OF SB ONE SEVENTY FORCE CONCEPTS. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT YOU MAKE IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE SYSTEM AND AND MAKE IT THE BASE OF THE SYSTEM. AND THEN ALIGN THE ENTIRE CHILD CARE SYSTEM TO THIS SINGLE TIERED REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE. TITLE TWENTY TWO STANDARDS WOULD EARN THE REVISED OR A MORE LEVEL IN THEIR COUNTY WE'RE CALLING THE BASE RATE. AND THEN PROVIDERS MEETING ADDITIONAL TITLE FIVE STANDARDS WOULD EARN THEIR COUNTIES BASE RATE WITH AN ADDITIONAL QUALITY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR FOR THEIR INCREASED REQUIREMENTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OUR GROUP I CALCULATED THE ADJUSTMENT FACTOR CONCEPT BASED OFF OF THE BIGGEST COST DRIVER BETWEEN THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TITLE TWENTY TO ENTITLE -- FIVE WE BELIEVE IT'S CALCULATIONS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE PILOT SECTION OF THIS BILL WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO INCENTIVIZE HIGHER STANDARDS FOR TITLE TWENTY TWO PROGRAMS. THIRD GRAPHIC YOU HAVE DONE EXPLAINS IN A VERY SIMPLE TRAFFIC -- SO UNFORTUNATE ALL THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED -- EXPLAINS THE IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN EVER PROPOSAL RATHER THAN EXPECT THE STATE TO ABSORB THE COST OF THIS NEW RATE SYSTEM OVER ONE YEAR WE ARE PROPOSING LIKE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THE STATE USE THIS NEW METHODOLOGY TO CREATE TARGETS FOR EACH TYPE OF CONTRACT BY COUNTY. MEN EACH YEAR THE BUDGET ACT IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WILL DECIDE HOW MUCH FUNDING GOES TOWARDS RATE INCREASES FOR THE ENTIRE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. AND THEN INCREASES WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY BASED OFF OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED AND THEIR TARGET AND THAT WOULD BE A YEAR BY YEAR BUDGET DECISION. SB ONE SEVENTY FOUR WILL MAKE THESE CRUCIAL CHANGES TO THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE DESIGN AND CREATE THESE NEW TARGETS FOR EACH COUNTIES FUNDING RIGHT. WE WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS PERRY WEEDY TOPIC IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY FOUNDATIONAL NOT ONLY FOR STABILIZING THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM WE CURRENTLY HAVE ACHIEVING THE CHILD OUTCOMES WE WANT FOR THE CHILDREN WHO WERE IN THE SYSTEM. FOR ACHIEVING THE VISION THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SET FORWARD FOR MORE AMBITIOUS SYSTEM OF SERVICE FOR ALL CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON EMILY MATHIS WITH UT W. ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY IN SUPPORT. HELLO LITTLE ANY I CANNOT ON BEHALF OF THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- ANYBODY HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. CASINO FOR YOU PULL BACK TO CUT COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK YOU THE THE CHOCOLATE RESOURCE CENTER YOU DO -- GREAT PHENOMENAL WORK IN MY DISTRICT AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. OUR CENTER GLAZER. YES I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FOR OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKED ON IT FOR A LONG TIME -- AND I KNOW THIS IS THE FISCAL COMMITTEE OKAY SO I GET THAT -- BY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WITH THE COST OF THIS OF THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED I WILL WITH THE COST OF THIS BE. I DON'T KNOW I WOULD SAY A LOT. CANDIDLY THE LADY'S ISSUE YES THANK YOU I CAN SPEAK TO THAT SO -- WE ATUALLY DEVELOPED ACOSTA MODELING TOOL IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY THE IMPLICATION STATEWIDE BUT FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES AND CONTRACT TYPES. AND IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THAT THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS CURRENTLY IN THE BILL I IN FRONT OF YOU WOULD BE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION ANTS AND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. WHEN IT'S AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REASON FOR THE RANGE IS BECAUSE WE DON'T FULLY KNOW WITH THE CHANGES TO THE ARE MORE SURVEY WOULD BE UNTIL THEY'RE DONE? SO THAT'S OUR ESTIMATE RAIN CHECK AND PART OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS OVER A MULTIPLE YEAR TRAJECTORY IS THERE ARE CHANGES THAT HAVE TO BE MADE TO THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY. TO ALLOW THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION SO THIS GIVES THE STATE THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE THOSE FISCAL DECISIONS AS REVENUES ALLOW. OKAY AT BECAUSE THE REASON I ASKED THAT IS THATLOOK IF THE QUESTION WAS SHOULD WE ADD YOU KNOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE CHILDCARE SLOTS SHOULD WE PAY EVERYBODY MORE. IS THAT OF COURSE THE ANSWER WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING. THAT -- THAT WE CAN HELP WITH -- BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE CHOICES WITHIN OUR BUDGET RIGHT AND I THINK THAT THE PART OF THIS THAT. I GUESS PAS GIVES ME PAUSE IS NOT REALLY THE RIGHT WORD JUST THAT IS TRYING TO BRING IT TO IS THE GROUND THIS IS THAT. WE'RE MAKING POLICY CHOICES HERE THAT. I I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND OR THEY OUGHT DO THEY CREATE THIS AUTOMATIC YOU KNOW IT THE QUESTION TO THAT YOU'RE NOT PUTTING BEFORE US WOULD USE WORDS LIKE UNIFICATION IT ON A LINE. THOSE ARE THOSE FOR ME AND THEY'RE TOUGH TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE SAYING WE WANT TO PROVIDE RAISES. TO MORE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE I GET THAT OKAY I GET THAT THAT'S CLEAR AND THAT'S NOT. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS THIS PRESENTATION A LITTLE CONFUSING TO ME HONESTLY IS THAT I I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE TERMS MEAN. IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT ONLY PAY SOMEBODY IN FRESNO DIFFERENTLY OR THE SAME AS SOMEONE LOS ANGELES THAT'S UNFAIR TO PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OKAY I I GET THAT. AND YOU CAN WE WANT TO INCORPORATE THE COST OF LIVING IN THAT CITY THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING THAT'S CLEAR TO ME OKAY -- BUT I I AM FINDING THIS A LITTLE HARD TO GET MY MY HEAD AROUND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT AN ISSUE A PHILOSOPHICALLY ALIGNED WITH WHAT YOU WANT. MORE SLOTS BETTER PAY. YOU KNOW -- A SENSITIVITY TO THE MARKET PLACE AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING AYE AYE. THAT'S THAT'S EASY FOR ME BUT I'M JUST SHARING THAT BECAUSE IT IT'S A GREAT POINT CENTER GLAZER AND I THINK THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU JUST GAVE GAVE ME SOMETHING TO WORK ON IF THIS BILL GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE ON THE NEXT COMMITTEE HITS -- I THINK PART MAYBE THIS WILL BE HELPFUL TO YOU HAVE THE RMR RATE WHICH IS THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE AND THEN YOU HAVE THE S. AS THE S. R. OUR RATE THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE. AND THEY'RE DONE DIFFERENTLY SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO BOTH OF THOSE REIMBURSEMENT RATES THE SAME WAY. BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THE SAME FOR TO SAN FRANCISCO SAN MARINO VERSUS ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY IT IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RATES ARE MORE UNIFORM. AND MORE ALIGNED SO THE PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID THE SAME ORDER THE SAME WITHIN THEIR AREA AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THE CHILD CARE. RAY AND AND IT'S THAT THAT THOSE EXAMPLES THAT I THINK ARE. A JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD ABOUT THIS SUBJECT OPENING UP MORE SLOTS OKAY THEN THEN WE SHOULD SAY THAT AND IF WERE. FIVE WE WANT TO PAY THEM MORE I GET THAT THEN WE SHOULD SAY THAT AND IF IT'S ABOUT -- BE MORE FAIR IN OUR IN EQUITY OF HOW WE PAY GET THAT FAIRNESS AND HOW IT AT OKAY WELL THEN LET'S OWN UP TO THAT TOO RIGHT IT'S ABOUT ALL OF THAT OKAY. SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I DO THINK THAT IF WE WERE. TO REALLY HAVE A GROUNDED CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS WERE WE I THINK IT JUST NEEDS TO BE CLEAR I HOPE YOU CAN WORK ON THAT ABSOLUTELY I APPRECIATE ALL THE GREAT WORK -- SUSTENANCE I HAVE BY FIRST ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER. WELL CAN BILLS BEEN MOVED NO OTHER COMMENTS. KING C. NINE SENATOR LEAVING ME CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] CLERK. ITEM FIVE SB ONE SEVEN FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA HI LEYVA AYE WILK AYE WILK I CHANGED TO WRESTLE GLAZER. PLEASE ARE AYE MCGUIRE PAN CAN I I LIKE IT [inaudible] OKAY. THE BILL GETS UP A REALLY NON CALL BECAUSE I'M SURE OUR COLLEAGUES WILL WHEN ADD ON THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU RICHARD YOU'VE BROUGHT FRIENDS. SENATOR ALLEN WELCOME. WE'VE HAD A BUSY MORNING HERE IN THE SENATE EDUCATION ORDERED. YES -- TO PRESENT ITEM FOR SB ONE FIFTY EIGHT PLEASE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. I THINK MANAGER MEMBERS SIR SB ONE FIFTY EIGHT A SIMPLE CODE CLEANUP BILL THE REPEALS AN OBSOLETE EDUCATION CODE SECTION RELATED. TO PEOPLE ASSESSMENTS THAT IS NO LONGER OPERATIVE. I RESPECT YES HAVE A WELL DONE THOSE IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING HEARING THAT'LL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER PAN WHICH I TO CLOSE. EXCUSE ME WE HAVE A QUESTION SENATOR WILK SO CENTER ALLEN I'VE HEARD A RUMOR IN THE CAPITAL THE THIS BILL IS NOT WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE IN THAT YOU'RE GONNA GOTTEN A MAN ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE SO I WAS JUST. POINTED OUT SAT [inaudible] SO. WELL THIS IS THE REMAINS TO BE SEEN TO BE HONEST WITH YOU -- AND AS THE ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A QUITE A BIT HAS BEEN IN THE AREA OF SPECIAL ED FIND -- FINANCING. AND WERE WE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOME SORT OF WORKABLE THING UNITES SERVED ON THE COMMITTEE WHEN WE I HAD THE BIG HEARING ON SPECIAL FINANCE I WILL BE ATTENDING THE SPECIAL FINANCE HEARING OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. TOMORROW I WHICH I THINK EVERYONE OUGHT TO TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT SO THAT SO WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH A WINNING FORMULA -- ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE DIG EXAMINE LAST YEAR [inaudible] IF THAT. YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT I WAS THAT'S PART OF MY CONTEMPLATION -- I DID I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'LL GET THERE NOT IN WHICH CASE WILL CLEAN UP THIS SECTION A CODE -- I'M I'M FINE WITH THAT I MEAN. SO THOSE I KNOW THIS IS A GREAT HONEST ANSWER WE OBVIOUSLY THAT IT'S A IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE OUR SCHOOLS FIRST OF ALL WE SHOULD HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FULLY FIND I. D. E. A..

SEVEN FIFTEEN YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS YOU ARE LUCKY. SEVEN FIFTEEN WOULD PROHIBIT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FROM ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT FOR SERVICES WITH AN ASSET MANAGER. FOR A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN IF THAT PLAN IS A STANDALONE OPTION AND IS NOT A COMPLIMENT IN ADDITION TO A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL IS SPECIFIC THAT THIS PROHIBITION DOES NOT APPLY TO DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN AS LONG AS THAT PLAN IS OFFERED AS A COMPLIMENT. TO A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WITH ME TODAY ARE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BILL'S SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND THE UNIVERSITY OF PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL EMPLOYEES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVALS. THANK YOU CENTER GALGIANI WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I MADAM CHAIR AND HONORED MEMBERS MY NAME IS AMY HEINZ STRIKE FOR A DC W. A LOCAL. NINETY ONE NINETEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN AND UC PRESIDENT JANET APPALL TONNEAU CAN BE IN THE COMMITTEE OF TO TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WOULD RECEIVE. THE RESULT WAS THAT GOVERNOR BROWN PROMISED TO INCREASE STATE FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN EXCHANGE FOR YOU SEE ACCEPTING THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE PENSION REFORM ACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS. INCLUDING THE CAP ON PENSIONABLE COMPENSATION THE UNIVERSITY PLACATED AT HIGHER INCOME EARNERS BY CREATING A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN FOR COMPENSATION OVER THE CAP. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN YOU SEE DECIDED TO EXTEND THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN THAT HAD BEEN CREATED ONLY TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOST PENSIONABLE BENEFITS ABOVE THE PEPPER CAP. EXTENDED THAT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN AS AN OPTION TO NEW EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR TOTAL COMPENSATION. THE OPTION FOR NEWER EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES TO DECLINE PAYING INTO THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION UNDERMINES THE ACTUARIAL STABILITY OF THE PENSION AND THEREBY ULTIMATELY IS POOR PUBLIC POLICY WE WOULD NOT ALLOW CALPERS OR CAL STAR IS TO BE UNDERMINED IN THIS WAY. SB SEVEN FIFTEEN WOULD AMEND PUBLIC CONTRACTS CODE TO STATE THAT YOU SEE YOU SEE SHALL NOT ENTER INTO A PUBLIC SERVICE CONTRACT WITH AN ASSET MANAGER FOR A DEFINED COTRIBUTION PLAN LET UNLESS THAT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN. IS A COMPLIMENT TO THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND IT'S NOT A STANDALONE OPTION. WE HAVE WORKED ON THIS BILL SINCE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND ONE IT WILL NO LONGER BE RETROACTIVE AND TWO IT WILL EXEMPTS THE STANDALONE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN THAT EXISTED BEFORE TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR EMPLOYEES WHO WORK LESS THAN 50%. KNOWN AS THE SAFE HARBOR PLAN WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. YES. I'M JOHN RENDON VICE PRESIDENT FOR LEGISLATION OF THE U. C. F. T. THE UNION REPRESENTS LIBRARIANS AND LECTURES AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND I'M ALSO LECTURING CLASSICS AT UC DAVIS I SPEAK IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. SEVEN FIFTEEN I'M IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH SOME SUCCESS YOU SEE ADMINISTRATORS HAVE BEEN OFFERING ALL NEW EMPLOYEES A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ITS TRADITIONAL DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. ONE MIGHT ARGUE WHETHER OR NOT YOU SEE ADMINISTRATORS BENEFIT THEIR INTENDED BENEFICIARIES NAMELY THEIR HIGHEST WAGE OR HIGHEST WHICH EMPLOYEES WITH THE NEW PLAN. HOWEVER WHEN THEY OFFERED AS AN OPTION TO FOR ALL YOU SEE WORKERS THEY DO HARM. THE SHIFT THE RISKS OF RETIREMENT ONTO INDIVIDUALS WHILE THE ALLOW RETIREMENT MONEY TO BE SIPHONED OFF TO WELL CONNECTED PROFESSIONAL MONEY MANAGERS. MOREOVER THE JUDICIAL PENSION PLAN ON PURPOSE ENCOURAGES EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND DEVELOPMENT WITH THIS NEW PLAN YOU WOULD MEAN YOU SEE ADMINISTERS FOSTER THE WORST ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT ECONOMY. WE'RE AND STRESSED OUT WORKERS MUST PERPETUAL BE LOOKING FOR NEW JOBS ELSEWHERE AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT IS OUTSOURCED. FINALLY YOU SEE MINISTRIES WE CAN THE OLD PLANTS ACTUARIAL PROFILE BY HURTING PEOPLE INTO THE NEW PLAN. AT NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATIONS THE POWERFUL FINANCIAL FROM FIDELITY WHICH HAS A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST HERE SINCE IT MANAGES THE MONEY IN THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION ACCOUNTS. NOW PRESENTS RETIREMENT OPTIONS I PERSONALLY KNOW ONE PERSON WHO FEELS TO SEE BY THE PRESENTATION. SHE REGRETS THAT SHE WAS CONVINCED TO GO FOR THE NEW DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW ONCE THE CHOICES MADE IT IS A RADICAL. ON BEHALF OF YOU SEE IF. WHO SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC ADVISORY BODY IT'S COUNCIL WOULD UNANIMOUSLY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IRISH PASSAGE OF SET OF SENATE BILL? SEVEN FIFTEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSE IN SUPPORT MANAGER MEMBERS BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE PROP CO SPONSORS OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. WALKING CHAVEZ VICE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE CW A NINETY ONE NINETEEN REPRESENTING SEVENTEEN THOUSAND UC WORKERS AND WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS SINCE -- I'LL JUST HAVE THE CW A WORKERS THAT ARE HERE JUST STAND IN SUPPORT OF SEVEN ONE FIVE SO WE DON'T HAVE. TO DON'T WE APPRECIATE YOU THANK YOU. WE RECOGNIZE ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO SHOW SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL [inaudible] COME FORWARD. TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION MISTER VICE CHAIR. JUST KIDDING. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- THE FIRST THEY MUST RISE TODAY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE OF THE UNIVERSITY'S OPPOSITION -- IS BASED ON THREE PRIMARY PRINCIPLES -- THE FIRST BEING THAT SB SEVEN ONE FIVE WOULD -- INTERFERE WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO MANAGE OUR RETIREMENT FUNDS IN THE WAY WE SEE IS A FIT AND APPROPRIATE WE DO THINK THAT -- THERE WILL BE -- TANGIBLE HARM BECAUSE TO EMPLOYEES WHO ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE DB PROGRAM. I'M SORRY THE DC PROGRAM IF WE WERE TO HAVE TO UNWIND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR SOME MORE ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR. BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TIMING OF THOSE -- AMENDMENTS IN TERMS OF BACKING OUT OF BUT AT THE AT THE MOMENT WE DO BELIEVE THERE WILL BE HARM TO EMPLOYEES. SECONDLY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DC PLAN IS A REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE PLANNED OFFERED TO OUR EMPLOYEES PROSPECTIVELY -- THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION THAT THERE'S BEEN A THUMB ON THE SCALE MADE SO TO SPEAK BY THE UNIVERSITY IN TERMS OF TRYING TO BRING FOLKS ON BOARD. WE WOULD STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THOSE ASSERTIONS -- THE AMOUNT THAT IS -- REQUIRED OF THE EMPLOYEE'S IN TERMS OF CONTRIBUTIONS THE PLAN IS THE SAME. BETWEEN THE DC IN THE IN THE CURRENT TV PLAN -- THE EMPLOYEE SUED DON'T MAKE A CHOICE OR DON'T MAKE ELECTION THE POND -- COMPLY WITH THE UNIVERSITY ARE DEFAULTED INTO THE DB PLAN WHICH IS HAT YOU WOULD HOPE THAT YOU KNOW MOST FOLKS TO BE ABLE -- TO AND THE UNIVERSITY HAS PROPOSED TO THE IRS THAT OPTION FOR THERE TO BE AN OFFICE BACK IN. TO THE TV PLAN AHEAD OF TIME AT A POINT THE FUTURE WE'VE NOT RECEIVED OF FORMAL APPROVAL FOR THAT -- OFTEN YET BUT WE DO EXPECT TO BE FORTH COMING VERY SOON SO THERE WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE THAT. AB SAID. MADE ELECTION THAT THEY THEY RETHOUGHT LATER ON TO TO MAKE A CHOICE -- IN TERMS OF ANY STEERING AGAIN FOR THE STEERING OF FOLKS INTO A CERTAIN PLAN VERSUS ANOTHER I SEE THE UNIVERSITY DOES OVERSEE AND REVIEW THE SCRIPTS SO TO SPEAK. THAT -- FIDELITY USES TO WORK WITH EMPLOYEES WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS NEUTRAL IF -- YOU WANNA LOOK AT OUR WEBSITE AND NOTICED THAT WE AGAIN ADEQUATELY EXPLAIN BOTH OPTIONS AND DESCRIBED IN A NEUTRAL FASHION. THIS COMMITTEE BE WELCOME TO DO SO -- IN ADDITION WITH REGARD TO AGAIN OUR OUR VIEW THAT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY FOR EMPLOYEES WE NOTE THAT -- LOOKING AT PAST SEPARATION DATA FOR SOME OF OUR LOWER WAGE WORKERS WE SEE THAT THE AFTER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD TIME ARE -- SEPARATION DATA IS SOMETIMES IN THE RANGE OF OF THE HIGH THIRTY NINE TO LOW 40% OR HIGHER. AND SO WHAT WE'VE GOT IS FOLKS WHO PERHAPS MAY NOT INTEND TO BE OF THE UNIVERSITY. FOR THE ENTIRE THEIR CAREERS AND IN THAT CASE THE DC PLAN ACTUALLY BENEFITS THEM. IT BENEFITS THEM BECAUSE IF THEY CHOOSE THE DP. THEY'VE GOT TO BE IN IN -- UNIVERSE IMPLEMENT FOR FIVE YEARS THE VAST UNDER THE DC PLAN THEY CAN TAKE THE UNIVERSITY CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS WITH THEM. AFTER JUST ONE YEAR. AND THEN LASTLY -- WE WOULD AGAIN ARGUE THAT -- FOR OPPOSITION TO SOMEONE FIVE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE ISSUES SHOULD BE RESOLVED AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. THE FACT IS THAT -- HIM SEVERAL UNIONS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE THIS THIS PLAN OFFERING AS WELL AS A FEW EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT WAGES HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS AND CONTRACTED OUT SO THOSE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON AT THE PARTY WERE NOW WE BELIEVE THAT SUPER PLACE FAMILIES. THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU IS OUR NATIONAL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING AND HEARING NONE ALL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR WILK HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS -- CHIANG ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SENATOR GALGIANI -- I AM A HUGE PROPONENT THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS -- DC PLANS A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION. THEY MAY BE THE SAME -- CONTRIBUTION FOR BALL BUT WHAT MAKES A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN SO MUCH BETTER IS WHEN YOU POOL ALL OF THAT MONEY THEN THE RISK IS NOT ON THE WORKER OR ON THE EMPLOYEE. EVERYONE ABSORBS A LITTLE OF THAT SO IN MY PERSONAL OPINION I THINK WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PRESERVE. OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS I THINK THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY IN DOING THAT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THINK YOU DID AN EXCELLENT. FOR ME. VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE WELCOME DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WOULD YOU DO A COURTESY MOTION. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT -- MISTER VICE CHAIR OF COURTESY MOTION BY THE VICE CHAIR SENATOR WILK MA'AM SECTOR THIS CALL THE ROLL ITEM TWELVE ITEM TWELVE SB SEVEN ONE FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE FLOOR LEYVA HI. I WILL. WILK NO CHANGE. TANGO LASSELL GLAZER OF CHOIR AND WE BELIEVE THAT BILL ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU WANT TO PRESENT YOUR NEXT BILL CENTER GALGIANI YES PLEASE ALL RIGHT SB. SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT WHICH IS FILE ITEM FOURTEEN PERCEIVE WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SB. SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT WHAT ESTABLISH THE STUDENT HOUSING AND FOOD HARDSHIP PLAN TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. UNDER THIS PROGRAM LEFTOVER MONEY DEPOSITED IN THE GENERAL FUND BY THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS ATTENDING A PUBLIC POST SECONDARY INSTITUTION. OR EXPERIENCING HOUSING OR FOOD HARDSHIPS TO APPLY FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY IS A PERSISTENT PROBLEM AND CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. OVER 50% OF CSU STUDENTS FACE HUNGER OR HOUSING AND SECURITY AND 11% OF USE OF CSU STUDENTS HAVE FACED HOMELESSNESS AND THE LAST YEAR. ANY SURVEY OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS NEARLY 60% OF THE STUDENTS HAVE DIFFICULTY MEETING THEIR BASIC NEEDS. EACH WEEK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HELP ALLEVIATE THESE NEEDS SO THAT STUDENTS CAN FOCUS ON THEIR SCHOOLING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER GALGIANI DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING AND HEARING THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. CENTER WILK THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CLEARLY THERE THERE'S FOOD AND SECURITY -- I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT. SO I'M CURIOUS. WHERE THE NEXUS IS BETWEEN THESE FUNDS AND THE PROGRAMMING AND THEN HOW MUCH MONEY TYPICALLY WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN A? ON AN AVERAGE YEAR DO YOU NOW I DON'T KNOW THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT PER YEAR BUT IT IT ACTUATE SAN. SIMEON DOES. AND AND TO DATE WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THOSE EXTRA DOLLARS AND JUST GOING INTO THE GENERAL FUND SO INSTEAD OF THEM POINT OF GENERAL FUND WERE SAYING TO PUT THAT INTO THE SPINE. AND THEN WE'RE LEAVING IT UP TO THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. ON HOW TO DEFINE WHAT A HARDSHIP IS IN WITH THE APPLICATION PROCESS WOULD BE AND HOW MUCH THAT. POOL OF MONEY WOULD BE SO THAT THEY WILL BE NIMBLE ENOUGH. TO AND ADAPT AND MAKE AVAILABLE MONIES THAT. ARE DIRECTLY IS SOCIALLY WITH WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEING. DIRECTED INTO THE AT A LATER DATE COULD YOUR STAFF GET BACK TO MY STAFF WITH. LIKE WHAT ME IT'S BEEN IN PAST YEARS. ABSOLUTELY SO I HAVE AN IDEA AND I'M CONCERNED. ABOUT I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR WORKCENTRE TRAINING COURSE OF VERY GOOD. WE ARE TO CLOSER ABOUT JOHNNY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU EITHER THANK YOU DO WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF BILLS THE MOVE BY SENATOR WELCOME MADAM SECRETARY THIS CALL THE ROLL. ITEM FOURTEEN SB SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. LEYVA AYE WILK HI WILK AYE CHIANG CHIANG I'D RUSSELL RAZOR WIRE AND COOLEY THAT BELONG CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I SEE SENATOR CABALLERO COMMA. FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB THREE SEVENTY ONE SENATOR PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB. THREE SEVENTY ONE MEASURE THAT ADDRESSES THE ALARMING NUMBER OF SCHOOL CHILDREN STRUCK BY VEHICLES WHILE GOING TO AND FROM THEIR SCHOOL BUS. DURING EVERY SCHOOL DAY IN CALIFORNIA SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN RIGHT A SCHOOL BUS TO AND FROM SCHOOL. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PEOPLE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES THERE ARE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD NOR THE STATE SCHOOL BUS STOP LAW. AS A SPEED BY SCHOOL BUSES AS CHILDREN APPROACH -- EXIT. THIS BILL WOULD AMEND THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE TO PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE OPTION. THE OPTION TO INCORPORATE SCHOOL BUS STOP LAW VIDEO TECHNOLOGY. THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT STOP VIOLATORS. SB THREE SEVENTY ONE CONTAINS PRIVACY JUDICIAL PROCESS SIGNAGE REQUIREMENTS AND PUBLIC EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS BEFORE VIDEO TECHNOLOGY CAN BE UTILIZED. THIS BILL ALSO PROTECTS SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS AS WELL AS SCHOOL EMPLOYEES FROM ANY INCREASED LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH VIDEO TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYED ON THE BASS. THEY ARE DRIVING THESE PRACTICES ARE TAKEN FROM SIXTEEN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IN IMPLEMENTED THIS VIDEO TECHNOLOGY. CALIFORNIA HAS TRAFFIC SAFETY LAWS IN PLACE FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN THE LAW REQUIRES DRIVERS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FLASHING RED LIGHTS. AND THE STOP ARM ON THE SCHOOL BUSES. DRIVERS BY LAW ARE REQUIRED TO STOP BEHIND THE SCHOOL BUS WHEN DRIVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS A BASS. AND BEFORE A BUS WHEN DRIVING IN AN OPT OPPOSITE DIRECTION THE FACT THAT CHILDREN TODAY CONTINUE TO BE STRUCK BY DRIVERS WHO DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAW INDICATES MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS BILL PROVIDES SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH ANOTHER TO ALL TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN SAFETY BOTH INSIDE THE SCHOOL AND ITS VICINITY. THIS PUTS CHILDREN SAFETY FIRST AYE AYE I THANK YOU AND I RESPECT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY AND THERE ARE THIS THIS BILL WAS TROUBLE REFERRED. ALL. RIGHT NOW I CAN MEET. AND SO THERE WERE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT -- THAT WERE -- TAKEN IN TRANSPORTATION AND JUDICIARY AND THEIR I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THOSE AMENDMENTS -- MY APOLOGY ON IT THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT WAS ON WAS BASICALLY TO MINIMIZE. FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TRY TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THIS THIS IS IT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S IT'S SO AND NUMBER TWO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW BEFORE ISSUING A CITATION IN OTHER WORDS IT GOES. TO IT'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT CITATION IT'S NOT ISSUED BY THE SCHOOL. ON AND AND THE THE AT THE FISCAL INCENTIVE WAS THAT THE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE MANUFACTURER SUPPLIER CAN'T INCLUDE AS VISION WHERE THEY GET COMPENSATION BASED ON THAT IT'S JUST THE PURCHASE OF THE EQUIPMENT AND THAT'S IT. KATHY BRING IN CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH AND AND ON YOUR POINT SENATOR. ARE WE ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF FEES. THAT CAN BE CHARGED IF YOU'RE STOPPED BY A POLICE OFFICER BETWEEN YOUR FINE AND YOUR COURT FEES AND OTHER THINGS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. ARE WE CONTEMPLATE A FEE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS ACTUALLY. NOTHING FOR THE FIRST NINETY DAYS SO THAT PEOPLE ARE INSTRUCTED THAT THEY SHOULDN'T VIOLATE THIS LAW. AFTER THAT YOUR FIRST VIOLATIONS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS YOUR SECOND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THREE TIMES YOUR STRIKE IS OUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE SAME KIND OF FEE THAT YOU'RE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WOULD GIVE YOU. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S FAIR WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO STOP. I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL SEEN THIS IS NOT AN UNUSUAL THING YOU STOP BECAUSE YOU SEE THE FLASHING LIGHTS THE STOPS ARM AND YOU STOP WELL WE WERE KIND ENOUGH NOT TO SEND YOU THE VIDEOS OF WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE CAPTURED WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN THEY DON'T STOP? ONE FAMILY AND I FORGET I FORGET THE STATE I'M SORRY STEVE WILL KNOW OP THREE SIBLINGS. CUT DOWN IN A CROSSWALK BECAUSE NOBODY STOPPED DESPITE THE ARM AND THE FLASHING LIGHTS. SO THIS IS THIS IS A BILL THAT SAVES LIVES AND THAT'S WHAT OUR COALITION LOOKS OUT WE WANT. TO REDUCE WHAT IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF CHILDREN WHICH IS NON INTENTIONAL INJURIES. AND REDUCE THAT SO THAT IT'S NO LONGER THE THE FATE THE FATAL OUTCOME THAT WE SEE. ALSO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS THE THE SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS. THANK GOODNESS FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU DO SUCH AN AMAZING JOB. THEY ACTUALLY GO OUT THERE FIRST WITH THE STOP SIGN RIGHT TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRAFFIC STOPPED. BUT YOU'VE ONLY GOT A SIGN. YES THAT'S CORRECT CENTER FOR SORRY. SENATOR PER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION THAT IS CORRECT OUR MEMBERS TO HELP -- CROSS STUDENTS ACROSS THE STREET A WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE SEVEN ONE BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW OUR SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS TO SAFELY TRANSPORT THE STUDENTS FROM THE STOP ACROSS THE STREET. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YEAH I'M MY NAME IS STEVE BARROW AND THIS IS ACTUALLY KATHY BREAKAGE WE GOT TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES. TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN SAFETY AND HEALTH I'M HERE IS THE CO CHAIR OF THE STATE'S UNINTENTIONAL INJURY PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN PROJECT WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING FROM DROWNING SUFFOCATION. TRAFFIC GETS INCIDENTS TO GET THOSE NUMBERS DOWN SOMETIMES IT'S A LOST MOST THE TIME WORKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TRYING TO HELP LOCAL -- PARENTS AND STUFF LEARN HOW TO DO THIS SO I'M JUST HERE TO TO SAY I TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS -- AND JUST TO REMIND YOU THIS HAPPENS THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION TIMES IN OUR STATE THERE ARE PEOPLE THESE ARE NOT CARS JUST CREEPING BY A SCHOOL BUS OR DRIVING FULL SPEED. AND IF WE COULD SHOW YOU THE VIDEOS OF WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR CHILDREN NOT THE ONES WHERE THEY GET HERE BUT THE ONES WHERE THEIR CHILDREN ARE WAITING AND WATCHING THE CARS ZOOM IN FRONT OF THEM.

FROM SHARING THE INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED ALTHOUGH THERE ARE POLITICIANS ON THE VENDORS OF THE EQUIPMENT SORRY I'M SHARING THAT. MEANT [inaudible] THAT DATA -- FINALLY -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE DANGERS OF COLLECTING THE DATA ARE HEIGHTENED BY THE LONG RETENTION PERIOD AND I NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE GOING TO SHORTEN. FROM CURRENT NINETY DAYS TO THIRTY DAYS WE BELIEVE THAT DON'T STILL. LONGER THAN IS NECESSITATED BY THE USE FOR WHICH THE VIDEO WILL BE PUT -- IT'S OR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT FORTUNATELY THERE THERE ARE NOT VERY MANY INCIDENTS OF INJURIES TO SCHOOL CHILDREN FROM -- HAILING FROM VEHICLES THAT HELL TO STOP BEHIND SCHOOL BUSES -- AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WITHOUT THE PROTECTION LOOKING FOR THE DANGERS.

AND THE CHURCH RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO PRODUCE. AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE YOU I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT TO THE BILL. SEVEN SIXTEEN WHICH WILL TAKE A CORRECTIVE STEP TOWARDS ENSURING THAT INCARCERATED YOU WILL HOLD A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA HAVE ACCESS TO A COLLEGE EDUCATION OR CAREER VOCATIONAL TRAINING. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT REQUIRED YOU LITTLE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE POST SECONDARY PROGRAMS OR THE EASIEST. STATUTE ONLY REQUIRES COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ND THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE A FULL HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM TO YOUTH IN CUSTODY. OF NOT COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO SEE A WITH PROVIDE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN CUSTODY. STATE REGULATIONS DO REQUIRE COUNTY PROBATION TO ENSURE THAT ALL YOU FOR THEIR FACILITIES ARE TREATED EQUALLY WITH REGARD TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY THE YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS STATES THAT YOUTH IN THE J. F.. HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE A QUALITY EDUCATION. THE YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS DOES NOT PLACE AGE OR GRADE LEVEL IMITATIONS ON THESE RIGHT. I AM AWARE OF CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH WE HAVE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SEE ISSUES IN UC'S IN PROBATION. TO ADDRESS POLICY COMMENTS STATED AND PAID FOR THE **** REGARDING SCOPE OF SERVICES REQUIRED BY THE LANGUAGE ARE AND THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE REQUIRED TO DETAIN YOU HAVE ACCESS TO QUOTE A FULL ARRAY. OF POST SECONDARY ACADEMIC AND CARRILLO TECH EDUCATION PROGRAMS. I AM CLEAR THAT A FULL ARRAY IS BROAD AND VAGUE LANGUAGE AND WE'RE GONNA WORK VERY HARD. TO GET SOME CLARITY. WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE JACQUELINE RODRIGUEZ A STUDENT AT COLLEGE OF SAN MATTEO. M. LUCY CARTER POLICY ADVOCATE FOR THE USE LAWCENTER. HELLO MY NAME IS JACQUELINE RODRIGUEZ I FIRST WANT TO JUVENILE HALL WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD AND IN SEVENTH GRADE. I GOT OUT FOR A MONTH AND THEN WENT BACK IN AND LITERALLY DID THREE YEARS I DO WHEN I'LL CAM GROUP HOMES THE JUVENILE HALL OR ON THE RUN. WELL I WAS IN THE CAMP EDUCATION WAS SO HARD FOR ME IT WAS ONE CURRICULUM FOR EVERYONE AND I WAS LEARNING WHAT OTHER GIRLS WERE LEARNING EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE MUCH OLDER. THEN A LOT OF THE GIRLS GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHILE THEY WERE STILL INCUSTODY. AND AFTER THE GRADUATION THEY STILL CAME TO COURT SCHOOL WITH THOSE BUT THEY SAT IN THE BACK OF THE CLASSROOM AND DID NOTHING BUT COLORING AND WRITING IN JOURNALS. OR WRITING LETTERS OR THEY WENT OUTSIDE IN THE GARDEN THEY HAD NOTHING TO STUDY NOTEBOOKS ARE EDUCATION PROGRAMS WERE OFFERED TO THEM. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FOR BECAUSE I BECAME CLOSE TO THOSE GIRLS AND I NEED THEIR POTENTIAL. THEY TELL ME THE GOALS AND THE DREAMS THEY HAD ONE WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR ANOTHER A PROBATION OFFICER. BUT I WOULD SAY TO THEM THERE'S NO HOPE FOR US WHO IS GOING TO HELP US. IT DIDN'T GIVE ME MOTIVATION BECAUSE THESE INTELLIGENT GIRLS HAD JUST FINISHED HER HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO WHAT THAT. WE TALKED ABOUT THEM GOING TO COLLEGE BUT THEY GOT NOTHING TO HELP. BUT THEY GOT NOTHING TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WHILE THEY WERE STILL INSIDE NO RESOURCES NO REAL OPPORTUNITY. AND NOW I KNOW THAT ONLY TWO OF THOSE GIRLS WENT TO ON TO COLLEGE AND THOSE TO STUDY COSMETOLOGY. NOW IN MY THIRD YEAR OF STUDY I COLLEGES ON THE TAIL AND I AM HOPING TO RECEIVE ASSOCIATES DEGREES AND FOUR SUBJECTS. WHAT I EXPERIENCE AS I DID PUSH ME TO ONE A COLLEGE EDUCATION BECAUSE I WANTED TO BREAK THE CYCLE RIGHT THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE? EDUCATE MYSELF AND BE A ROLE MODEL FOR MY KIDS. NOW BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT I'VE ALREADY FOR ANYTHING I'M SO EXCITED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND TO LEARN TO LEARN FROM OTHERS AND TO HELP OTHERS LEARN FROM ME. I STRONGLY SUPPORT AS THE SEVEN ONE SIX BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ALL YOU TWO ARE INCARCERATED HOW FULL POTENTIAL LIKE ANYONE ELSE. AND THEY SHOULD HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY EVEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES THAN EVERYONE ELSE BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO AND THE POSITION THEY ARE AND AS THE SEVEN ONE SIX PROVIDES THE NECESSARY OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO GO TO COLLEGE BREAK THE CYCLE AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR SOCIETY. ASK YOU TO VOTE OR IS AS THE SEVEN ONE SIX THANK YOU. HI YES I'M LUCY SOCIO CARTER WITH THE YOUTH LAWCENTER. AND YOU'VE HEARD MISS RODRIGUEZ'S TESTIMONY ABOUT THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AND SHE WAS IN HALL IN CAMP WITH. AND THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO FURTHER THEIR EDUCATION. HER EXPERIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE. THERE'S A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH IN CUSTODY IN JUVENILE FACILITIES WHO HAVE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS OR EQUIVALENCY. AB TWENTY THREE OH SIX WHICH WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALLOWS YOU. TO COMPLETE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA IF THEY'RE IN A FACILITY WITH THE MINIMUM STATE REQUIREMENTS. THIS LOSS RESULTING IN MORE AND MORE YOUNG PEOPLE IN CUSTODY. WHO HAVE THEIR DIPLOMAS BUT NO POST SECONDARY PROGRAMMING? OTHER PERCENTAGE IS AS HIGH AS ANECDOTALLY. I'VE BEEN A HALL RECENTLY WHERE FIVE OF EIGHTEEN YOUNG PEOPLE IN CUSTODY HAVE THEIR DIPLOMAS AND NOTHING TO DO. I'M I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE HAVE SOME PROGRAMS. A POST SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN CUSTODY IN CALIFORNIA YOU. THESE NEW PROGRAMS ARE MODELING WHAT A PROBATION HIGHER EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP CAN LOOK LIKE AND THEY'RE USING EXISTING RESOURCES IN THE INSTITUTIONS. I'M. AND I WANT TO SAY ALSO THAT THESE STUDENTS ARE LIKE OTHER STUDENTS THERE WILL BE YOU KNOW THEY STILL HAVE TO MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL AID -- THEY JUST HAPPENED TO BE STILL IN CUSTODY -- AND THEY WANT TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO RE ENVISION THEMSELVES AND THEIR FUTURES. SO BY SUPPORTING SENATE BILL SEVEN ONE SIX YOU'RE HELPING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO RIGOROUS POST SECONDARY EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES TO DO JUST ABOUT. I'M I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU.
