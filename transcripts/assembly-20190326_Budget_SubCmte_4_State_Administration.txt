I'M HERE TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S CALIFORNIA FOR ALL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN FUNDED THROUGH AB SEVENTY TWO AND SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS ROLE. BEFORE DIVING INTO THE DETAILS OF THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FINDING I WONDER FIRST CLARIFIED. THAT IN TOTAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS AWARDED FOR THIS EFFORT. WITH THIRTY MILLION BEING ADMINISTERED BY OUR AGENCY. I ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY FOR THEIR SWIFT APPROVAL OF AB. SEVENTY TWO AS WE BELIEVE IT CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BY IMPACTING AT LEAST ONE MILLION OF THE MOST DISASTER AND SOCIALLY VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I THINK AS YOU KNOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS COMMITTED TO TACKLING ISSUES OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAD ON WHILE THE GOVERNOR VALUES DATA ON ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS HE BELIEVES OUR STRATEGY FOR PREPAREDNESS. NEEDS TO BE INFORMED BY QUOTE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY FACTORS INCLUDING SOCIALIZE ISOLATION POVERTY. LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND OTHER ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS TO CHALLENGES. THAT IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN IS A CRUCIAL PILLAR OF THIS DISASTER FINDING. I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME CAMPAIGN DETAILS. THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN WILL LEVERAGE THIRTY MILLION OF AB SEVENTY TWO FUNDING TO BUILD RESILIENCY AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN UNDER RESOURCE AREAS. AT THE HIGHEST RISK FOR NATURAL DISASTERS IT WILL CONNECT CALIFORNIANS TO PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE EFFORTS THROUGH THREE PRIMARY STREAMS. THE FIRST ONE WILL BE TWENTY FOUR MILLION. POINT TWO FIVE WHICH WILL BE GRANTED TO EMPOWER CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS CBO'S TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS EDUCATION AND RESOURCES. WELL HELLO YES WILL BE ADMINISTERING A MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS WILL BE SUPPORTING THE EXPANSION OF THESE STYLES. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH LEAST US IT'S A PROGRAM THAT WAS STARTED IN SANTA BARBARA.

SERVICE EQUIPMENT [inaudible] THE CARD. RIGHT YOU'RE ALL GOOD THANK YOU. ISSUE ITEM NUMBER NINE AMERICORPS EXPANSION RIGHT -- IF IT'S POSSIBLE IF I COULD HAVE SHEILA BOXLEY JOIN ME FOR SOME COMMENTARY SHE'LL BE -- SHE'S THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION CENTER ONE OF OUR GRANTEES. POSSIBLE. PLEASE GREAT THANKS. SOME ALSO YOUR TODAY TO HIGHLIGHT ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS AMERICORPS FINDING. I'M JOINED BY SHEILA BOXLEY THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION CENTER AND ONE OF CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS GRANTEES. IN A MOMENT SHE'LL BE ABLE TO SHARE FIRST HAND HER INSIGHTS ON WHAT IT MEANS TO REALLY UTILIZE AMERICORPS MEMBERS WELL I DRESS BUT BEFORE THAT I'D LIKE TO OFFER A GLIMPSE INTO AMERICORPS CALIFORNIA. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW AMERICORPS IS A FEDERAL FUNDING SOURCE THAT USES THE POWER OF SERVICE TO ADDRESS LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS. OUR STATE COMMISSION CURRENTLY OVERSEES FIVE THOUSAND AMERICORPS MEMBERS SLOTS THAT ARE PLACED WITH SIXTY GRANTEES. OVER 50% OF THE FUNDING REQUIRED TO RUN THESE PROGRAMS COMES FROM A LOCAL MATCH SOURCE. WHICH TYPICALLY COMES FROM A LARGE CORPORATION A FOUNDATION. OR PERHAPS OTHER PUBLIC FUNDS. GOVERNOR NEWSOME UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE MANY HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES THAT SIMPLY ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO SECURE THIS MATCH AND THEREFORE THEY FIND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO APPLY. THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROPOSING AND INVESTMENT OF STATE FUNDS IN THIS CASE TEN OF THE TWENTY MILLION. TO GROW AMERICORPS IN THESE HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES. ALSO AS MANY AS YOU MAY KNOW UPON THE COMPLETION OF A FULL YEAR OF FULL TIME SERVICE AN AMERICORPS MEMBER RECEIVE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO PAY BACK STUDENT LOANS OR TO INVEST IN FUTURE STUDIES OR TRAINING. THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED AN INCREASE OF THIS AWARD TO REACH TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER FULL TIME MEMBER. WITHIN INVESTMENT TOTAL OF TEN MILLION. THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA'S STUDENT DEBT IS THIRTY THREE THOUSAND PER PERSON. AND WE BELIEVE THAT ONE WAY TO PAY DOWN A PORTION OF THIS DEBT. IS TO ASSIST THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO GIVE A YEAR OF THEIR LIFE IN SERVICE TO HIGH NEED CALIFORNIANS. WE BELIEVE THAT WHILE SACRAMENTO HAS BENEFITED FROM STRONG AMERICORPS PROGRAMS LIKE BIRTH IN BEYOND WHERE MEMBERS TEACH PARENTING SKILLS TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES. ALL HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES DESERVE THIS PROGRAM. WHILE CITY YOUR LOS ANGELES MEMBERS GIVE INVALUABLE SUPPORT TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AGAIN ALL STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES DESERVE THESE PROGRAMS. WE HAVE AMERICORPS MEMBERS PROVIDING SERVICES FOR VETS FOR THE HOMELESS FOR FOSTER YOU. AS WELL AS MEMBERS ENGAGED IN MY BUYER MIDDLE STEWARDSHIP AND HELPING LOW INCOME FAMILIES NAVIGATE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I MEAN THAT SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IN THE END AMERICORPS MEETS COMMUNITY NEEDS BY ADDING CAPACITY TO THE ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ON THE GROUND. DOING THE HARD WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT AMERICORPS MEMBERS TAKE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND BECOME A PART OF THE NONPROFIT AND PUBLIC SECTOR WORK FORCE. OR WORK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH A VIBRANT COMMITMENT TO VOLUNTEERING. AND IT ACTUALLY SAVES TAXPAYER DOLLARS BY PROVIDING EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF OUR MOST CHALLENGING PUBLIC NEEDS. BUT ABOVE ALL AMERICORPS UNITES CALIFORNIANS IN SERVICE AS MANY VETERANS WILL TELL YOU. ALTHOUGH THE SERVICEMAN OR WOMAN STANDING NEXT TO YOU MAY LOOK DIFFERENT FROM YOU ARE COME FROM A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND. SERVING TOGETHER CONNECTS YOU IN A TRULY FUNDAMENTAL WAY. AND IN THE DAY AND AGE WHERE OUR SOCIETY IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE FRACTURED WE ARE CALLED TO INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER. THAT'S WHAT MAKES US STRONGER THAT'S WHAT UNITES US AGAIN ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS ARE REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY THANK YOU AND IF WE CAN. BRIEFLY TOUCH UPON SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS YES I WILL INDEED TRY TO BE BRIEF I'M SHE LOVE OXLEY THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION CENTER WHICH IS A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION. AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE BEEN USING AMERICORPS AS A KEY STRATEGY FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS IN THIS DAY AND TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IS ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED AND INDIVIDUALS TODAY OUR AMERICORPS MEMBERS. FOR HELPING TO PREVENT CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT. THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL WITH 97% OF THE FAMILIES THAT THEY WORK WITH AND WE CAN PROVIDE THAT SERVICE THROUGH AMERICORPS HOME VISITATION THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER SERVICES FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A FAMILY A YEAR. AND THE COST FOR A CHILD WHO GOES INTO CHILD WELFARE IS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO THERE'S QUITE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT. AND THERE'S BEEN A RECENT -- VERY RECENT REPORT THAT'S COME OUT AND SAID THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO SPEND ABOUT NINETEEN TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THE IMPACTS OF CHILD ABUSE NEGLECT. SO WE THINK THIS IS IS A SERIOUSLY VALID A RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND A REALLY GREAT STEP FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ONE OTHER QUICK THING WE'RE ABLE TO RECRUIT PEOPLE TO BE AMERICORPS MEMBERS FROM WITH IN COMMUNITIES. SO THEY REFLECT THE COMMUNITIES THEY'RE SERVING AS AN EXAMPLE ONE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO PROVIDE SERVICES IN FOURTEEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SO WE'RE ON THE GROUND WE'RE GIVING PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR OWN FUTURE. AS WELL AS FOR THOSE THAT THEY SERVE. THANK YOU THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR YOUR COMMENTS -- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. LA OR FINANCE NO PROTEST ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS. GOOD WE'RE STREAMING ALONG THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THIS ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN ANYONE ECONOMIST [inaudible] YEAH. SO LET'S GO BACK. TO THE FIRST ITEM OF FOR ITEMS TO BE HEARD. ISSUE NUMBER ONE STATEWIDE FINANCE INSURANCE POOL. MISTER DALE FOUNTAIN WITH ENACT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA [inaudible] WELCOME. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO MAKE A PRESENTATION YES. LEGISLATORS GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM ON DALE FOUNTAIN CHAIRPERSON AND CEO OF AN ACT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA. I REPRESENT THE LARGEST SINGLE PAYER ORGANIZATION IN CALIFORNIA. WITH OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SUPPORTERS WHO ACTUALLY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY I'M HERE TODAY. IT'S NOT THROUGH CALLING OR LETTERS OR BEING POLITE. THAT GOT ME THIS PRESENTATION. NO IT WAS BY TELLING FILL TANG THAT HE WON'T BE REELECTED NEXT YEAR. NOW I WAS PROMISED. I WAS PROMISED HELP WITH ACTUARIES AND I WAS PROMISED A FULL FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTE PRESENTATION BY TING STAFFER. CHRISTIAN GRIFFITH. BUT I WAS LIED TO BECAUSE THIS CAN ONLY BE A FIVE MINUTE SPEECH NOT RECEIVE NOTHING. BUT A GOOGLE SEARCH WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD ME. OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T GIVE A FULL PRESENTATION WITH ONLY FIVE MINUTES SO I PARED IT DOWN CONSIDERABLY AS YOU'LL HEAR IN A MOMENT. LET'S GET TO THE HISTORY OF SINGLE PAYER LEGISLATION IN THE LEGISLATURE'S RESPONSE. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SB FIVE SIXTY TWO WAS INTRODUCED. PASSED THE SENATE. AND STOPPED BY THE ASSEMBLY. OKAY. WE AT LEAST MY AWARD. UNDERSTOOD THAT THE STATE CONSTITUTION NEEDED TO BE AMENDED TO EXEMPT HEALTH CARE FUNDING FROM ARTICLE THIRTEEN BEAT THE STATE SPENDING CAP. AND ARTICLE SIXTEEN A. K. A. PROP. NINETY EIGHT WELL DESPITE SO MANY LEGISLATORS CLAIMING TO SUPPORT SINGLE PAYER. NO ONE SUPPORTED THE NECESSARY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OKAY. THE ASSEMBLY HELD HEARINGS ONE OF WHICH I WAS A PANELIST ON AND ONE OF THE BILLS THAT CAME OUT WAS THE COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS WHICH WAS TASKED TO RESEARCH AND RECOMMEND A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. IT PASSED THE ASSEMBLY AND THEN WAS INSERTED INTO THE BUDGET BY GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN HIMSELF AND ENACTED INTO LAW. IN THE INTERIM ASH KALRA INTRODUCED A PRICE CONTROL BILL IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT PASSED THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. AND THEN HE QUIETLY WITHDREW IT WITH NO EXPLANATION GIVEN. PRICE CONTROLS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ALL UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE INFORMATIONS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T WANT TO TACKLE THAT EITHER. IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELECTIONS MOST OF YOU CAMPAIGNED ON SINGLE PAYER. OR AT LEAST SIGNIFICANTLY REFORMING OR TAKEN SUBSTANTIAL STEPS TO MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE. PRESENT DAY. GAVIN NEWSOM STILL HASN'T MADE HIS THREE REQUIRED APPOINTMENTS TO THE COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. AND THE COUNCIL HAS ALREADY MISSED ITS FIRST MEETING. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION I GOT FROM TONI ATKINS AND ANTHONY RENDON OFFICES. THEY SOMEHOW HAVE APPOINTED THE SAME PERSON. AND DESPITE YOUR CAMPAIGN PROMISES NONE OF YOU HAVE TAKEN ANY ACTION BEFORE THE FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND DEADLINE FOR NEW BILLS. SO MUCH FOR SINGLE PAYER. OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE DID SOME POLLING. 61% OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT INCREASED TAXES FOR SINGLE PAYER. 51% OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT ELIMINATING PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR SINGLE PAYER. AND 67% OF CALIFORNIANS OPPOSE PENALTIES FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE. ALL OF THESE POLLS ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE FOR YOU TO ANALYZE. SO LET'S GET TO THE STATE WIDE HEALTH INSURANCE POOL. AS I'VE SAID ON PERRANCE DOWN SOMETHING EXTREMELY SIMPLE. HERE IT IS SKIFF OR STATE FUND. WILL BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC FOR REGULAR HEALTH INSURANCE AS A PUBLIC OPTION. STATE FUND ALREADY HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE ACTUARIES AND THE PROVIDERS. AND IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE CAN LIMIT. PROP NINETY EIGHT WAIVERS ARE LIMITED BY ERISA. AND IT COST THE STATE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO THIS. NOW WE'RE NOT TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE. THIS NEW MANDATE FOR STATE FIND NEEDS TO SHOW UP IN THE MAY BUDGET GET PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. ARE NONE OF YOU ARE COMING BACK AFTER THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. IF YOU SURVIVE YOU PRIMARIES. MY WORK SUPPORTERS GOT YOU ELECTED IN MY ORG SUPPORTERS COLLECT SOMEONE ELSE. SEE THAT WAS SIMPLE NOW DO YOUR JOB HAVE A GREAT DAY. THANK YOU LIKEWISE [inaudible] OKAY.

NEXT ITEM ISSUE NUMBER. ELEVEN THIS IS THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. UPDATE ON FISCAL PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND PROP PAYMENT TRAILER BILL WELCOME. GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON SORRY. I FEEL LIKE IT'S MORNING AS WELL. MY NAME IS MERRIAM BARCELONA ENGINEER -- AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA OUR DISCOUNT. AND I THOUGHT I WOULD START WITH JUST A VERY HIGH LEVEL. OVERVIEW -- AGAIN JUST JUST TO TO REFRESH THE COMMITTEES -- MEMORY HERE. THIS GIRL IS ONE OF THE LARGEST MOST DYNAMIC I. T. UNDERTAKINGS THAT THE STATE HAS -- DEPLOYED. THAT IT IS NOT ONLY AN I. T. PROJECT BUT ALSO A BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION EFFORT. WE ARE -- DEPLOYED IN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENT SO A SET OUT -- TO IMPLEMENT AND AS THE SCOPE HAS BEEN -- THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED THERE UTILIZING THE SYSTEM. WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OF THEM ARE HAVING PIECES OF THEIR LEGACY SYSTEM STILL IN USE UNTIL WE FINISH -- THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE ARE DEPLOYING. WHERE 98% OF THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE SET OUT TO DEPLOY IS IN PRODUCTION? THAT INCLUDES THE BUDGET SO WE HAVE ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED NINETY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGETARY EXPENDITURES. ARE THREE OUR SYSTEM AS OF YOU KNOW WITH INCLUDING THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. ADD TO THAT REPRESENT 65% OF TOTAL BUDGETARY EXPENDITURES. IN OCTOBER WE BROUGHT ON THE TREASURY FUNCTIONS WHICH IS TWO TRILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BANKING TRANSACTIONS THAT THE CONTRACT THAT THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE -- PERFORMS NOW UTILIZING OUR SYSTEM. WE HAVE -- NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND PROCUREMENT OUR BIDDERS AND SUPPLIERS THAT ARE UTILIZING OUR SYSTEM AS WELL TO DO BUSINESS OUT OF SELLING GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE CURRENTLY OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND END USERS THOSE ARE STATE EMPLOYEES UTILIZING OUR SYSTEM TO DO THEIR DAY TO DAY JOBS -- I JUST WANT TO BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY OF US WAS FOR THE UPDATE ON THE SCO COMPONENTS AND WHERE WE ARE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT FINAL FUNCTIONALITY. WE IN S. P. R.. SEVEN WE BROKE OUT THE DEPLOYMENT METHODOLOGY FROM A WATERFALL RIPOFF THE BANDAID DOING IT ALL AT ONCE TO TAKING THAT FUNCTIONALITY BREAKING IT INTO BUSINESS PROCESSES AND WE RELEASED THAT. WHEN WHAT WE WERE CALLING MILESTONES MILESTONES ONE TWO AND HALF OF THREE ARE FULLY DEPLOYED? AND MILESTONE THREE BE -- FOR AND MILESTONE FIVE WE ARE LOOKING. TO BE DELAYED. AND TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THE PROPER TESTING IN PLACE BUT WE DEPLOY. SO THAT IS -- AN ITEM THAT IS BEFORE MY STEERING KID COMMITTEE TOMORROW AND WE'LL BE BACK TO LEGISLATURE WHEN WE HAVE. A DEFINITIVE ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT [inaudible] CONTROLLERS OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS GEORGE LOW LISTEN I'M THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE -- WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTROL FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE SAYS -- THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED -- AS SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH FINALIZING SOME OF THEIR WORK ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEM WE HAVE AS WELL. AND WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT AND OUR PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE FUNCTIONALITY IS WORKING PROPERLY THAT ENHANCEMENTS THAT MAY NEED TO BE MADE ARE IMPLEMENTED SO THAT THE WORKLOAD ISSUES BOTH OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND ALSO MY OFFICE -- CAN BE RESOLVED. AND WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS HENCE THE POSSIBLE DELAY THAT ARE THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED OF THE MILESTONE THREE B. AND MILESTONE FOUR AND FIVE FUNCTIONALITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IS WORKING THE WAY IT NEEDS TO BE WORKING AND THAT THE WORKLOAD -- IS IT IS AT A LEVEL THAT THE STAFF CAN KEEP UP WITH IT. AND DO OF RICHARD GILL AND RIDICULOUS AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THE DEPARTMENT CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER BUT ALSO MY DAY JOB ON THE FISCAL PROJECT SPONSOR. TAKEN ON THAT ROLE ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO -- SO SINCE I RETURN TO FINANCE AND AND STEPPED INTO THE ROLE PROJECT SPONSOR -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD AS A STEERING COMMITTEE AND AS A PROJECT IN AS AS AS THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING THE FINAL STAGES THIS PROJECT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. AND DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY -- IT'S NO SECRET SOMEWHERE DEPARTMENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THINGS LIKE MONTH IN CLOSE YEAR AND CLOSE -- SOME OF THOSE ARE AS AS RESULT OF DESIGN DECISIONS THAT WERE. TO THE VERGE OF MOVING PASS BUT WE WE HAVE THIS LAST HURDLE BEFORE SO AS MISTER ENGINEER SAID THERE'S A STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING TOMORROW OR THE PARTNERS WILL DISCUSS -- PERHAPS A CHANGE IN STRATEGY ON THE FINAL ROLL OUT OF THE CONTROLLERS FUNCTIONALITY -- AND ASSUMING THAT HAPPENS -- IT'S LIKELY THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE BACK WITH THE PROPOSAL BETWEEN NOW IN AMERICA'S AND THE LAYOUT. UP BRIAN METZGER LA -- FIRST WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- BUT WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS -- WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT -- SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS INCLUDE THE CONTINUED ON BOARDING OF DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE PART OF THE JULY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN RELEASE. AND THEIR CONTINUED USE OF LEGACY SYSTEMS AND THE POTENTIAL DELAYS -- IN COMPLETING THEIR YEAR END FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LIKE A COMPANY THAT -- WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE NUMBER DEPARTMENTS IF IT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED OUTSIDE OF THE PROJECT SCOPE -- AND THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BRINGING THOSE DEPARTMENTS ONLINE -- WILL NOT BE CAPTURED IN THE TOTAL PROJECT COST CURRENTLY. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY TRANSACTING FISCALE -- RELATED TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE FUNDING THAT ARE BEING REQUESTED THROUGH THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET -- WERE AWARE OF SIX BCP'S WHERE THAT IS OCCURRING. AND WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT DEPARTMENTS FACING CHALLENGES CLOSING THEIR MONTH END AND YEAR END FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- LOOKING IN NUMBERS YEAR OVER YEAR -- THERE ARE CONCERNS AROUND YOU KNOW THE THE THE PERCENTAGE THAT ARE ABLE TO CLOSE AT LEAST THE FIRST MONTH -- OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE CONTINUE DELAYS AND AND AGAIN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE QUITE A BIT LARGER IN THIS LATEST RELEASE -- THAT COULD AFFECT THE TIMELINESS OR QUALITY OF THE STATE'S ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT -- WE ARE AWARE THAT THERE ARE CHANGES FOURTH COMING IN THE PROJECT BASS LINE AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT PROCESS GOING FORWARD. SO I'VE BEEN PRETTY QUIET IN THIS COMMITTEE MEETING BUT I AM GONNA PIPE UP AT THIS POINT -- AND I KNOW I CAN TELL FROM THE PANEL THAT -- IS NOT OF YOUR PARTICULAR EXCITED TO BE HERE ON THIS TOPIC. FOR MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IF I CAN I THINK THIS PROJECT WAS DESCRIBED JUST A FEW MINUTES GOES A DYNAMIC PRODUCT. PROJECT AND I THINK IT REPRESENTS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FAILURES. IN STATE GOVERNMENT IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO STATE GOVERNMENT IT'S BEEN A DISASTER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROJECT THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT IS NOW. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF OVER ON LATEST TAB IS NINE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND NOW WHAT WE'RE HEARING THIS AT THEIR CONTINUED DELAYS -- I'D LIKE TO SECTION THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IF YOU COULD ARTICULATE. I'VE UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LETTER SENT THE LEGISLATURE I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME THAT. HAS ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT THIS SYSTEM COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN THE REPORTING OF ACTOR FISCAL STATEMENTS FOR THE STATE'S KAFFIR. WHICH COULD I UNDERSTAND POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR STATE'S CREDIT RATING. COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR A RESPONSE FROM THE PROJECT. THERE COULD BE A VARIETY OF REASONS WHY THE STATE'S KAFFIR COULD BE DELAYED -- THEY COULD BE SYSTEM ISSUES THE COULD BE WORKLOAD ISSUES WHEN YOU SAY COULD BE SIR I'M SORRY WHAT WHAT'S THE ANSWER. YOU JUST DON'T ACTUALLY EVEN KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT THE KAFIR CAN BE DELAYED AND OR HAVE ISSUES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS? OUR AND STATE AUDITOR CAN PROBABLY EXPLAIN WHAT THOSE REASONS ARE. THE THE CAPPER WHICH IS THE STATE'S AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE DELAYED BECAUSE OF COMPLEXITY IS HAVING TO WHAT WHAT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT PARTICULAR HERE. IT COULD BE DELAYED BECAUSE OF THE WORKLOAD ISSUES WHETHER IT'S FISCALE -- WORKLOAD ISSUES. OR OTHER ISSUES WITH IN OTHER SYSTEM SO THERE'S A THE CARD THE CAPPER IS A COMPLEX ANIMAL THE KAFFIR PROJECT PLAN EVERY YEAR HAS OVER NINE HUNDRED DELIVERABLES. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE IT. AND HAVE THE STATE AUDITOR ISSUE AN OPINION. SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ISSUES AND EVERY YEAR IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT'S NEVER THE SAME THING TWICE THE CONTROLLERS CONCERN THIS YEAR WAS SOME OF THE ISSUES WE WERE HAVING WITH THIS GAL. AND NOT NECESSARILY -- TECHNICAL ISSUES BUT WORKLOAD ISSUES THAT WE WERE HAVING WITH THIS GAL MAY CAUSE A DELAY IN THIS YEAR'S AND OR NEXT YEAR'S KAFFIR. AND ALSO AS THE LA -- MENTION BECAUSE SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS ARE HAVING TROUBLE CLOSING THEIR BOOKS AND PROVIDING THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT IS WHAT THE CONTROLLERS CONCERNED ABOUT AND HER LETTER WAS. PRIMARILY DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO JUST GET THAT WORD OUT THERE THAT SHE HAS THAT CONCERN THAT WE FOCUS ON THE ENHANCEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP WORKLOAD ISSUES. BOTH AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL AND SCO LEVEL IN ORDER TO GET THINGS RESOLVED AND GET THE KAFFIR AND OF THE OTHER FINANCIAL -- PRODUCTS THAT WE NEED TO PUT OUT. ON TIME THAT'S WHAT THE LETTER WAS INTENDED TO DO THE CONTROLLER HAS FULL SUPPORT IS FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROJECT HAS FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE PROJECT WILL SUCCEED -- THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE EFFICIENCIES BUT IT'S A BELL SHAPED CURVE RIGHT IT'S GOES UP IT UP HERE FOR AWHILE THEN IT WILL EVENTUALLY WILL GO BACK DOWN. BUT IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED NOT ONLY FOR THE DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO FOR THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE -- CONTROL FUNCTIONALITY TO WORK. IF I COULD ASK FOR RESPONSE FROM THE PROJECT LET ME SAY I I A I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN OUR CONTROL -- AND I A BELIEVER ASSESSMENT THAT -- THERE ARE CONTINUE NEEDS. FOR NEEDS FOR DELAY BUT GIVEN THE HISTORY OF THIS PROJECT GIVEN THE FACT THAT SOMEONE BORN IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHO'S NOW IN HIGH SCHOOL WOULD EXPERIENCE AN AWFUL LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES OVER THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS. MANY OF US HAVE JUST NO FAITH THAT THIS PROGRAM IS EVER GOING TO COME TO COMPLETION SO -- TELL US WHY WE SHOULD HAVE SOME FAITH. SO THE PROJECT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AS JUST THE BUDGETARY REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS THAT WAS OUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO THIS PROJECT. AND THAT COST ESTIMATE WAS AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO REPLACE THE FOUR MAIN FRAMES. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF OTHER SYSTEMS STATEWIDE THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THE STATE COMPTROLLER THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES PROCUREMENT DIVISION. AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S -- THE ORIGINAL SCOPE OF THE BUDGET BEING SYSTEM REPLACEMENT WERE COMBINED INTO WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA FISCAL. THAT ESTIMATED THAT TIMES OF THE SCOPE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED AND THAT INITIAL -- ESTIMATE WAS AT ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROJECT BOTH THE SCOPE AS WELL AS THE SCHEDULE HAS SHIFTED. BASED ON THE NEEDS ARE THE CURRENT NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND WHERE THE CONTROL AGENCIES AS WELL AS IN ONE CASE WE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE WAY WE ON BOARD DEPARTMENTS WE WENT FROM THE IDEA IT WHEN WE WERE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO HAVE. PEOPLE IN EVERY SINGLE DEPARTMENTS TO HELP WITH THIS TRANSITION TO A TRAIN THE TRAINER MODEL WHICH IS WHAT WE ULTIMATELY IMPLEMENTED. THAT IN SOME PART WAS DUE TO THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT THAT TIME. SO. THAT IS THE HISTORY OF OF THE DOLLARS AND THE SCOPE HAS CHANGED HAS BEEN ADDED SUBTRACTED WE'VE ADDED REPLACEMENT FUNCTIONALITY -- FOR THE BACK OFFICE AT THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES WHICH WAS OUT OF SCOPE AND IS NOW IN SCOPE AND WE DEPLOYED THAT SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT. HAVE BEEN DONE THE PROJECT IS TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. IN THAT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS ARE UTILIZING IT -- FOR THEIR ACCOUNTING ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE UTILIZING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS BEEN INTRODUCED UTILIZING THE FISCAL SYSTEM. AND THE MAN SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN WE HAVE PRETTY EIGHT BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE A WEEK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE. THE ENACTED BUDGET WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT THE INTRODUCED BUDGET IS WHICH IS MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE PUBLIC AS A MINISTRY. IF I MAY COULD YOU JUST RESPOND TO THE ISSUES OF RACE IN THE CONTROLLERS LETTER BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK. WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS RESPONDING TO THE WHOLE FAILURE PIECE TO START THAT'S HELPFUL I I THINK WHAT THE PUBLIC CONTINUES TO HEAR? MORE DELAYS MORE BUREAUCRACIES. WHEN IT COMES TO WHY THIS IS THE CASE? I HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE NOW THIS IS MY MY FIFTH YEAR AND EVERY YEAR I SAY I THINK YOU KNOW I KEEP ASKING THESE QUESTIONS AND I AM TEMPTED NOT TO VOTE. FOR ANYTHING ELSE TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM BUT I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND WE'RE SURE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THAT THINGS ARE ON TRACK AND THEN WE GET YET ANOTHER LETTER SAYING. THAT A KEY PARTNER IN THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF OUR STATE. DOES NOT HAVE FULL FAITH AND CONFIDENCE YET THAT THE SYSTEM IS READY TO GO. SO AGAIN AS SAID THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE DID STATE. THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO PRIORITIZE WHATEVER ENHANCEMENTS WILL HELP ASSIST THE DEPARTMENTS. WE ARE WRECKED WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS DO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE. AND WE ARE RE PRIORITIZING AND REDIRECTING SOME OF THE EXISTING CONTRACT DOLLARS FROM. WORKING ON SOME OF THE FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WHICH WE ARE DELAYING TO ASSIST THE DEPARTMENTS -- WITH THEIR MONTH ENDING YEAR AND CLOSE THERE IS KEY ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED IN HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN THE RECENT WEEKS. WE CONTINUE TO WE'VE IMPLEMENTED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ENHANCEMENTS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. TO THE SYSTEM SO IT IS A CONSTANT DYNAMICALLY CHANGING SYSTEM TO MEET THE NEEDS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. OF A HUNDRED FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND USERS AND FOR CONTROL AGENCIES THAT ARE BOTH CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES. SO THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROJECT CANNOT BE OVERSTATED AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ON A PATH. TO GET THIS VERY I MEAN THAT WE ARE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED REQUIREMENTS AT A FORTY FIVE HUNDRED OR FORTY TWO HUNDRED PLUS. REQUIREMENTS IN THE SYSTEM WHEN WE SET OUT THEY'VE BEEN DEPLOYED. AS WELL AS THE ENHANCEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM WE WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE OF MY OTHER PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT A QUALITY PRODUCT IS PUT OUT ON THE STREET AND THAT. WE DO NOT HAVE -- ISSUES WITH INTEGRITY OR QUALITY OF THAT YOU KNOW COULD HAPPEN IF WE RUSHED TO DEPLOYMENT BEFORE THE THE SYSTEM IS FULLY TESTED AND THIS DISTORTS REMAINING FUNCTIONALITY. IS ACCEPTED BY THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE SO THE COMMITTEE REPORT SAYS THE CONTROLS FUNCTIONALITY WAS DELAYED REPEATEDLY AND IS STILL YEARS AWAY FROM BEING REALIZED. IT'S HARD TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO THE CALLS FOR YET ANOTHER DELAY USING THE SAME ARGUMENTS OF IMPENDING DOOM THAT BEEN USEFUL LAST FIVE YEARS WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE DATE THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD BE FINALIZED. IF I GET ASKED TO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. GIVE ANY SENSE. AS FAR AS THE SCHEDULE GOES NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE FINAL TWO MILESTONES TO BE RELEASED. WHICH ARE MILESTONE FOREIGN MILESTONE FIVE I BELIEVE -- AND THAT WOULD BE THE LAST TWO PIECES OF FUNCTIONALITY THAT WOULD GO LIVE AT THAT POINT. OUR OUR OFFICE WOULD NEED TO PRODUCE A KAFFIR. ARTIFICE GAL. THE FOR THE FOR THAT FISCAL YEAR -- SO IT TO TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF THE WORK PROPERLY TO PRODUCE THE KAFFIR WOULD TAKE ANOTHER ANOTHER YEARRIGHT IT WOULD BE. THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR BUT THE FUNCTIONALITY WILL ALL BE IN PLACE BY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY HAS THIS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE NEW GOVERNOR. A FEW DISCUSSES WITH HIS TEAM. WE HAVE BRIEFED ADMINISTRATION ON THE STATUS OF THE PROJECT YES AND ARE THEY WHAT WHAT IS THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS -- AS I SAID IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS -- SO MINISTER COMMITTEE TAKES AN ACTION THAT WE EXPECT TO TAKE -- TOMORROW -- YOU SHOULD EXPECTED MINISTRATION WILL SUBMIT A REVISED PROPOSAL BETWEEN NOW AND THE MAY REVISION FOR ADDITIONAL BUDGET EXPENDITURES TO PUSH THIS PROJECT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE HOW MUCH WHAT'S YOUR GUESS. NOT GONNA GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL OKAY. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I'M OBVIOUSLY GOING TO ONE OF WILL KNOW A LOT OF INFORMATION BEFORE I AM READY TO VOTE FOR THAT. AND I THINK MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES WILL LIKELY FEEL THE SAME JUST A GUESS ABSOLUTE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GIVE. WHAT'S THE CURRENT. WHEN I GO NOW TO ISSUE TWELVE THIS ITEM I THINK IS A LITTLE LESS CONTROVERSIAL. IF WE COULD GO TO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JENNIFER URBAN AND I'M THE CHIEF OF BUDGETS AND CONTRACTS AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. THAT'S HE WAS REQUESTING PERMANENT RESOURCES TO CONTINUE PERFORMING AUDITS OF HOLDERS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA UNCLAIMED PROPERTY LAW WHICH RESULT IN INCREASED UNCLAIMED PROPERTY TO BE REUNITED WITH ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN S. HERE RECEIVE SIX PERMANENT POSITIONS AND ELEVEN THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO PERFORM AUDITS OF NON COMPLIANT HOLDERS. ELEVEN LIMITED TERM POSITIONS IF NOT APPROVED THROUGH THIS REQUEST WILL EXPIRE ON JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. SINCE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE SCO HAS BEEN APPROVED CONTINUATION OF THE SAME RESOURCES ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS. THROUGH THESE AUDITS SCO HAS IDENTIFIED AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND REPORTABLE PROPERTY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IN THE SAME TIME HERE THE AVERAGE COMPLIANCE RATE IS ABOUT THIS WORKLOAD IS ONGOING AND APPROPRIATELY SUPPORTED WITH PERMANENT RESOURCES TO ENSURE HOLDERS CONTINUE TO REPORT AND REMIT UNCLAIMED PROPERTY. TO SCO FOR THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF RETURNING TO THE RIGHTFUL OWNER. THE RESOURCES WILL ALSO ASSIST HOLDERS AND CREATING UNCLAIMED PROPERTY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING UNCLAIMED PROPERTY IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WHEN WE GOT OUT TO TO BERMAN FINANCE? AIR COVER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUPPORTS THE CONTROLLERS ONGOING EFFORTS FOR ITS ADDRESSING HOLDER COMPLIANCE -- AND WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. HELLO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU -- BUT WE DID TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A BROADER PERSPECTIVE IN A REPORT RECENTLY LOOKING AT SOME OTHER WAYS TO INCREASE HOLDER COMPLIANCE IN THE PROGRAM. GIVEN THE SORT OF VAST UNDER COMPLIANCE RATE OF 2% YOU KNOW AUDITS ONE IMPORTANT DETERMINANT DETERRENT -- CAN'T WITH YOU KNOW A COUPLE DOZEN ON IT'S A YEAR AND ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. SO THAT REPORT INTRODUCED TO DIFFERENT POLICY OPTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO THIS LOW COMPLIANCE RATE. THE FIRST WOULD BE TO REQUIRE HOLDERS TO REPORT TO FTP IN THEIR ANNUAL TAX FILINGS JUST INFORMATIONAL QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY SUBMITTED A REPORT TO THE TO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THIS WOULD HELP BRING MORE AWARENESS TO THE PROGRAM AND THEN THE SECOND WOULD BE TO PROVIDE A TEMPORARY AMNESTY PERIOD FOR THOSE HOLDERS THAT HAVE BEEN NON COMPLIANT IN THE PAST. TO OFFER THEM A TEMPORARY PERIOD TO COME FORWARD -- TO REPORT PASSED YOU UNCLAIMED PROPERTY AND TO YOU DON'T HAVE A TEMPORARY -- AMNESTY FROM THE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE TO COMPLY -- OBVIOUSLY THE MAJOR GOAL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WOULD BE TO REUNITE MORE PEOPLE WITH THEIR PROPERTY -- BUT THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE A GENERAL FUND BENEFIT PERHAPS IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF PUBLIC WISH TO COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. SO WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION -- I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY MISTER NAZARIAN WHO HAS HAD RUN OUT TO PRESENT ANOTHER BILL TO HOLD. ISSUE THIRTEEN UNTIL HE'S BACK SO WE WILL DISCUSS THE ARTS COUNCIL -- LIKELY IN A FEW MINUTES IF WE GAVE BILL NOW TO ISSUE -- FOURTEEN THE CAL ABLE PROGRAM CALIFORNIA ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DANTE ALLEN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA A BLACKBOARD -- WE ARE HERE TODAY -- WITH A PROPOSED GENERAL FUND LOAN OF ONE MILLION SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO CONTINUE AND ARE IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION OF THE CALIFORNIA ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE PROGRAM WHICH IS. A SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PROGRAM THAT OFFERS -- TAX ADVANTAGE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT -- HARMER INTERFERE THEIR QUALIFICATION -- FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDED BENEFITS. LET'S MOVE TO DEPART IN FINANCE. DOMINIC AIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS. BELLY UP NO GOOD SENSE -- I THINK CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO SEE THRIVE IN THIS STATE LET ME ASK THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISH TO COMMENT ON THE SIDE OF ALSO. GIVEN THAT I CAN MAKE A MOTION BY MYSELF -- WHEN WE HAVE ENOUGH OF A QUORUM WE WILL ASK FOR THIS TO BE APPROVED AS BUDGETED AND APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION? IF I COULD ADD -- WE OPENED OUR DOORS IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE. ACHIEVED A ROBUST ENROLLMENT WE HAVE ABOUT AS OF YESTERDAY NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN OPENED -- WITH JUST OVER THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT THAT'S FANTASTIC I THINK WANNA SEE THAT CONTINUE TO GROW. THANK YOU THANKS TO WORK. WHEN WE MOVE NOW TO GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY MOVING TO ISSUE? FIFTEEN OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. WHAT'S THAT BUT IT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN. I WOULD SAY MEMBERS BEFORE A LITTLE SHORT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TO GO AHEAD DEPARTMENT FINANCE AGAIN -- I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT A A MORE. POSITIVE TECHNOLOGY TOPIC THAN THAT THE AGENDA YOU HEARD EARLIER IN REGARDS. TO A LARGE IT PROJECT I'M. THE GOVERNMENT'S FOR TOO LONG HAVE NEGLECTED TO THINK ABOUT THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WHEN DELIVERING GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND FUNCTIONS WHETHER IN PERSON THROUGH THE MAIL OR EVEN ONLINE. AS WE BROUGHT TECHNOLOGY IN OUR WORK WITH LARGELY FOCUSED ON AUTOMATING EXISTING PROCESSES AND WORK FLOWS BASED ON HOW WE THINK THINGS SHOULD WORK FAR TOO OFTEN WE FAIL TO ASK THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO ACCESS GOVERNMENT SERVICES WHAT'S HELPFUL TO THEM? WHAT THEY THINK OF THIS AND AND WHAT DO THEY THINK THE SERVICES WE DO PROVIDE? OUR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS -- HISTORICALLY BEEN. LARGELY ONE OFF ONE DEPARTMENT ONE SOLUTION APPROACH IS THAT ONLY HAPPEN AFTER INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS COME FORWARD. TO SOLVE A DEPARTMENTAL NEED AND WHILE THIS APPROACH IS ACCEPTABLE IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES A PERHAPS IN THE TWO THOUSANDS -- IT'S NO LONGER VIABLE APPROACH TO MEETING THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS. A RECENT EXPERIENCES SHINED A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK I NEED TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE -- TECHNOLOGIES RELENTLESS ADVANCE HAS RADICALLY CHANGED A LOT OUR LIVES IN THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN FROM HOW AND WHERE WE GET INFORMATION. CONDUCTOR FINANCIAL AFFAIRS SHOP ACCESS ENTERTAINMENT HOW WE INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER THE WORLD IS A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE TODAY THAN IT WAS JUST A DECADE AGO. IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES COMPETE FOR THE CUSTOMER'S ATTENTION AND BUSINESS BY THE LIVING WORLD CLASS USER EXPERIENCES THEY FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER AND SO SHOULD WE SO THIS PROPOSAL IT'S ABOUT CHANGING CULTURE. IT'S ABOUT VALUING INNOVATION. IT'S ABOUT INVESTING IN OUR WORKFORCE IT'S ABOUT DELIVERING GOVERNMENT SERVICES IN A WAY THAT IS ACCESSIBLE MEANINGFUL AND INTUITIVE TO THE PUBLIC WE SERVE. IT'S ABOUT IMPROVING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND IT'S NOT ABOUT BIG I. T. AND BIG PROJECTS IT'S ABOUT INNOVATION AND THAT'S A CLEAR DISTINCTION I WANT ME WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY HERE AS MUCH AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INNOVATION AND SERVICE DELIVERY TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. THIS PROPOSAL -- IS DIFFERENT CONCEPTS SUBSTANCE AND EXECUTIVE SUPPORT THAN ANYTHING WE'VE DONE IN THE SPACE BEFORE. AN EXECUTIVE SPONSORSHIP STARTS AT THE TOP OF THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF THIS GOVERNOR LITERALLY STUDY THIS AREA AND WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT -- THIS PROPOSAL IS GENERALLY BASED ON SUCCESSFUL MODELS ORIGINATING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WITH THE GOVERNMENT DIGITAL SERVICES -- HERE AT HOME WITH US DIGITAL SERVICES AND EIGHTEEN F. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ANOTHER DIGITAL SERVICE OPERATIONS OF VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AROUND THE WORLD. MOST FOLLOW A SIMILAR WELL ESTABLISHED PLAYBOOK. OUR GOALS FOR THIS OFFICER TO ESTABLISH A CULTURE OF INNOVATION SOMETHING IT'S VERY HARD TO DO IN GOVERNMENT -- DRIVE A CUSTOMER CENTRIC MINDSET OR OTHERWISE KNOWN AS HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN THAT REALLY MEANS THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA USE OUR SERVICES WHEN YOU DESIGN YOUR SERVICES. BUT TO SOFTEN THEIR ISSUES ASK THEM. WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT SOMETHING THE STATUS STRUGGLED ON HISTORICALLY WE'RE GONNA UTILIZED AGILE AND OTHER OPEN APPROACH AS TO HOW WE BUY AND BUILD THINGS WE'RE GONNA DO PROTOTYPES BUILD. TEST ITERATE GET FEEDBACK TESTED RATE AGAIN SO ON IT'S ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN DATA. IT'S ABOUT COLLABORATION SHAREABLE AND REUSABLE SOLUTIONS AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER. TO THAT END -- THE ADMINISTRATION IS REQUESTING INITIAL START UP RESOURCES OF THIRTY SIX POINT POINT SEVEN THAT'S GENERAL FUND. FOR TWO POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING NINE POINT SIX THAT'S GENERAL FUND AND ABOUT FIFTY POSITIONS TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICER DIGITAL INNOVATION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. THE OFFICE AS PROPOSED WILL HAVE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP AND ENFORCE REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPARTMENTS TO ASSESS THEIR SERVICE DELIVERY METHODS AND MODELS AND UNDERLYING BUSINESS PROCESSES FROM A CUSTOMER OR END USER PERSPECTIVE IN THESE AUTHORITIES ARE. DEFINED IN THE CORRESPONDING TRAILER BILL. THE KEY PIECES OF THIS PROPOSAL ONE IS BEYOND THE OFFICE ITSELF IS THE IS THE CREATION OF INNOVATION ACADEMY. AND IN OUR VIEW SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION REQUIRES A CULTURE OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IT'S A MINDSET IS NOT JUST WORDS THAT THAT WE HAVE TO DRIVE THAT CULTURE CHANGE. AND THOUGHT AND A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO HUMAN CHANGE MANAGEMENT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THESE ARE TWO AREAS THAT THE THERE BEEN A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE FOR GOVERNMENT GENERAL AND CALIFORNIA'S NO EXCEPTION. THE OFFICE WILL ADDRESS THESE NEEDS TO THE CREATION OF A SCALABLE INNOVATION ACADEMY FOCUSED ON CONTINUOUS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT HUMAN CHANGE MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE SPONSORSHIP. AND A CUSTOMER CENTRIC MINDSET. IN THIS ACADEMY WE ENVISION WILL BE MANDATORY FOR ALL STATE SUPERVISORS MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES -- WE ALSO INTEND INVESTED THIS'LL TRAINING IN OUR I. T. WORK FORCE. IN AREAS OF AGILE AND OTHER MODERN DEVELOPMENT PLATFORMS AND TOOLS IS THIS OFFICE DEVELOPS INTO FINDS TOOLS IN A PATH FORWARD FOR DIGITAL STRATEGY FOR CALIFORNIA. WE WANT TO TAKE THAT KNOWLEDGE AND PUSH IT OUT TO OUR STATE IT WORKFORCE AND INVEST IN THEM SO THEY BRING THOSE SKILLS AND THAT VISION TO THEIR DEPARTMENTS AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY. A KEY PIECE OF THIS PROPOSALS INNOVATION FUND. A PROPOSED INCLUDES FUNDING FOR ONE TIME FUNDING OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ALLOW THE OFFICE TO ASSIST OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS PRIORITIZE NEEDS. THIS IS INTENDED TO ALLOW THE OFFICE MOVED QUICKLY TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND PROVIDE SOLUTIONS IN REAL TIME AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT CHANGE FROM THE EXISTING BUDGET AND I. T.. PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS SEES WHICH ADD YEARS TO TIME LINES SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. THEY TEND TO LEAD TO LARGE PROJECT PROPOSALS. AND ARE CORRESPONDINGLY RISKY AND COSTLY LARGE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATIONS. WE FULLY KNOWLEDGE THAT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL THESE FUNDS ARE YOU LIES WILL BE A CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE OFFICE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND I HAVE IN THAT AREA. FINALLY WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THERE WAS SOME APPARENT OVERLAP WITH THE PARTNER TECHNOLOGIES EXISTING OFFICE ADDITIONAL INNOVATION WHICH IS BEING RENAMED TO AVOID ANY CONFUSION GOING FORWARD HOWEVER AT THIS POINT. WE'RE NOT THINK THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT -- DUPLICATION RATHER WE SEE THE OFFICE AND SEE TIAS HAVING COMPLEMENTARY ROLES -- AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE ONLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND LET ME -- SEE IF I CAN JUST START AND SET THE TONE THAT I WANT TO ABOUT THIS FIRST OF ALL I AM. VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS -- AND JUST FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE LET ME JUST READ FROM SOME OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING HIS OFFICE WILL BE AN AMAZING CHALLENGES CHALLENGE THAT WILL REQUIRE INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP FROM THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. SIMILAR APPROACHES HAVE BEEN TRIED BEFORE LEFT THE STATE WITH COSTS THE LEGACIES OF FELL PROJECTS YEARS ADRIFT IN A CULTURE THAT A SPURNED INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY. I. T. PROJECTS FAIL IN SACRAMENTO BECAUSE OF A LACK OF OWNERSHIP GOVERNANCE WERE TRAINING. IN ONE PUBLICATION WAS ESTIMATED THAT'S WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST AND I THINK IT WAS -- APPROPRIATE THAT WE HAD THE ITEM AROUND FISCAL JUST A FEW ITEMS AGO BECAUSE THAT. TELLS YOU WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST. IN MY PERSPECTIVE IS -- THE VISION IS FANTASTIC AND THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS RIGHT AND THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE A LOT OF DETAILS ON HOW THIS IS GONNA BE CARRIED OUT SO MY QUESTIONS REALLY. ARE JUST TRYING TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON QUESTIONS ARE RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE ALL HAVE -- THIS IS FOCUSED ON REALLY AN AGILE. APPROACH AN AGILE PROCUREMENT APPROACH -- BUT OBVIOUSLY OUR STATE HASN'T REALLY HAD THAT SKILL SET OR THAT EXPERTISE AND WONDERING HOW YOU PLAN TO BRING THAT IN QUICKLY -- I THINK RELATED TO THAT -- THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WE GROW THIS PROJECT OVER TIME AND WONDER IF YOU CAN JUST GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE AROUND HELD BASS THIS OFFICE MY GROW -- AND THEN CLEARLY WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- STATE WORKERS AND BY AND BY THE STATE BUREAUCRACIES WILL BE CRITICAL TO MAKING THIS HAPPEN AND THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT TENSION WITH OUTSIDE TECH VENDORS WERE POINTED THE FINGER AT STATE BUREAUCRATS WILL POINT FINGERS BACK AT TECHNOLOGY WORKERS. CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW YOU PLAN TO MANAGE. THE PAST TENSIONS AND AND MOVE IT INTO MORE POSITIVE FUTURE SURE FOR FIRST LET ME START BY BY -- RESTATING THIS IS NOT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THIS IS NOT ABOUT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS THIS IS ABOUT SERVICE DELIVERY MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING TO IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE DIGITAL SPACE THAT'S WHERE SOCIETY IS TODAY. SO SO DON'T THINK OF THIS IN TERMS OF BUYING OR BUILDING BIG STATE IT PROJECTS IT'S ABOUT FOCUSING ON SERVICE DELIVERY HOW WE DELIVER SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS WHERE THE PAIN POINTS FOR THE PEOPLE TO HAVE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT HOW TO MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR THEM HOW. CAN WE MAKE THE PROCESS MORE INTUITIVE EASIER UBIQUITOUS TO A JUST LIKE THEIR LIVES ARE TODAY WITH MOBILE PHONES AND COMPUTERS AND AND PORTABLE DEVICES THEY THERE THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO LIMIT ON YOUR PERSONAL LIFE AND HOW YOU INTERACT WITH. BUSINESSES AND YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND EVERYTHING ELSE. EXCEPT THAT WHEN YOU GET TO THE STATE LEVEL THE THE STATE FORCES YOU INTO NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES BUSINESS PROCESSES. MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN AUTOMATED AND PUT ON A WEB AND THEY'RE NOT VERY INTUITIVE THEY DON'T HAVE FULL FUNCTIONALITY THEY DON'T PROVIDE INFORMATION THEY DON'T HAVE OPEN DATA. THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT A LOT OF BAD OUT THERE AND LOT OF PROBLEMS ARE TRYING TO SOLVE. AND BUT THIS IS ABOUT A TARGETED EFFORT TO TO FOCUS ON THE DELIVERY OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AND THIS MODEL HAS BEEN DONE SUCCESSFULLY AROUND THE GLOBE SO WE'RE NOT INVENTING SOMETHING NEW HERE WE ARE IN FACT TAKING. A GOVERNMENT LED MODEL THAT -- WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN EUROPE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL UNITED STATES HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN OTHER PLACES AND WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT WEEK WE GET BEAT UP WHEN THINGS GO BAD WE WE RIGHTFULLY ARE TAKING OUR LUMPS OVER WHAT'S HAPPENING AT DMB. AND AND AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT THIS IS A MORE SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO FIXING THOSE THINGS PROACTIVELY AS OPPOSED TO FIXING REACTIVE WE WANT SOMETHING BLOWS UP. SO I I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD ASK THAT WE LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS OF SERVICE DELIVERY AND NOT LINK IT NECESSARILY TO OUR HISTORY WITH BIG IT PROJECTS BECAUSE NOTHING WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS ABOUT THE GUY TO PROSECUTE YOU GIVE. ANY EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOUR VISION. WHAT ON WHAT LIKE IN WHAT CONTEXT? ANY CONTEXT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TACKLE FILM SO SO WE'VE WE'VE IDENTIFIED A COUPLE OF OF PRELIMINARY TARGET OPPORTUNITY. PARCHMENTS DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES BEING. ONE WHERE -- IT'S RIGHT FOR AN ENTIRE REVISIT OF HOW THEY HOW THEY SERVE THE PUBLIC AND WE'VE LOOKED AT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS IN THE LICENSING FUNCTIONS THAT THE PARTNER CONSUMER AFFAIRS WHICH HAS BEEN A CONSTANT STRUGGLE -- AS THEIR STARTING POINTS BUT WE'RE ALSO ALONG WITH THIS IS IS THE THE BUILDING OF THE BIT ACADEMY IN DELIVERING THE TRAINING TO HELP DRIVE THE CULTURAL CHANGE THE DRIVE THAT MINDSET CHANGE. AND THEN WITH THE INNOVATION FUND AND THE DEPARTMENT THE OFFICE BEING ABLE TO GO OUT AND LEAD DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS ON A PARTY BASIS FOR DEPARTMENTS MAYBE IT'S BUILDING A NEW APP MAYBE IT'S REDESIGNING -- THE WAY YOU REGISTER OR RENEW YOUR VEHICLE REGISTRATION -- AND BRINGING THAT TO BRING THAT TO BEAR TO THE PUBLIC AS A NEW INNOVATIVE SERVICE AND THEN THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY DOING THAT WE WILL THEN HAND OFF TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE SIMILAR BUSINESS PROCESS NEEDS. TO TO TAKE IT TO SCALE AND APPLIED ACROSS EXECUTIVE BRANCH COULD YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF WHERE THIS IS WORK ELSEWHERE AND I YOU ALLUDED TO THEM BUT YEAH IN IT THAT'S WORKED IN GREAT BRITAIN -- THEY HAVE THERE'S THERE'S A TON OF MATERIAL OUT THERE ABOUT THE SUCCESSES -- THE PROJECTS THEY'VE DONE AND HOW VALUABLE SPEND AND THEY STARTED. IN ENGLAND WITH -- ALL THEIR VARIOUS WEB DOMAINS IT WAS IT WAS A A MISMATCH ACROSS THE YOU KNOW THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THERE'S HUNDRED IF I GOT MY WEBSITES THEY THEY WERE ABLE TO BRING ALL THAT INTO A SINGLE PLATFORM. AND A SINGLE PORTAL FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE U. K. TO ACCESS GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND FUNCTIONS. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN THE UNITED STATES -- US DENTAL SERVICES DID SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK TO IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY DID -- LOG IN DOT GOV WHICH IS A SORT OF US. IDENTITY MANAGEMENT FEATURE FOR US CITIZENS ACCESSING CERTAIN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN A BILL DIDN'T HAVE NOW EXTENDED THAT SAME FUNCTIONALITY THAT CITY BUILT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY CAN EASILY LINK IT TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE SOMEWHERE IDENTITY MANAGEMENT IS A NEVER ROLLED OUT ACROSS A NUMBER OF AGENCIES. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THERE'S THERE THERE'S THERE'S A TON OF OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT THE GOOD WORK BEING DONE IN THE SPACE AROUND THE WORLD. AND GIVEN YOU YOU YOU POINTED TO TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY ABSOLUTELY OBJECT WE FAILED AT THINK ABOUT THE USE OF IT DMV AND THE PARTY CONSUMER SERVICES. DCA WHAT'S WHAT'S THE THINKING ON WHAT YOU WOULD DO NEXT GIVEN THE YEARS OF CHALLENGES. IN ALTON SENSES FIRST IT'S STARTING WITH THAT. SHIP THEM PERSPECTIVE AND THAT IS A CUSTOMER. FOCUSED. BUSINESS PROCESS DELIVERY SO THINK ABOUT ALL THE LINES OF BUSINESS YOU DO. AND WHO HAS TO INTERACT WITH YOU AND AND HOW THEY CAN INTERACT WITH YOU. AND SO A DMV IT'S IT'S RIGHT FOR REINVENTION. YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR'S ASSIGNED US A STRIKE TEAM TO GO IN THERE AND AND ISSUE SOME PRELIMINARY. INFORMATION ON THAT WE ALSO HAVE AN AUDIT -- AND A TECHNOLOGY REVIEW HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME ALL OF THOSE THINGS COULD BE USED TO INFORM ON A PRIORITY BASIS. WHERE THE BEST VALUE IS AS FAR AS MEETING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND AND WHAT? BUSINESS PROCESS AND SERVICE DELIVERY FOCUS ON FIRST AT THE DMV. AND ANOTHER LOT OF FOLKS HERE FOR OTHER ITEMS SO -- ONE AND I SUGGEST I BE I'D LIKE TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU GUYS ARE THINKING PARTICULAR LOVE TO SEE EXAMPLES THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING FROM OTHER PLACES AND WHAT YOU MIGHT. DO TO BRING IT HERE BOTH OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS ARE ONES THAT I THINK ARE -- ACUTELY -- OF INTEREST FOR MANY OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY WEEK -- OUR OFFICE GETS A COMPLAINT FROM YET ANOTHER CONSTITUENT WHOSE BODY THEIR HEAD UP. INVOLVING ANOTHER BUREAU UNDER THE CA A AND THEN THE DMV IS JUST AN ON GOING -- SET OF CHALLENGES ABSOLUTELY WE WE HEAR IT TOO WE WE HEAR IT ALMOST EVERY DAY AND HAPPY TO TO WORK WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE AND AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- AND PROVIDE ANY DEATHS AND ALL INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS ONE FINAL QUESTION WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE DMV TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS -- MORE TO COME -- COME ON GIVE US SOME HOPE. THE PART OF FINANCE -- I'M SORRY. YEAH I JUST WANT TO MENTION WE DID PUBLISH A BUDGET AND POLICY POSTS ON THIS ISSUE AND RAISE SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM -- BUT JUST WANNA KINDA CATEGORIZE THEM FOR YOU -- SO THE FIRST OF THOSE BEING KIND OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE RELATIVE TO THIS NEW OFFICE -- PARTICULARLY AROUND THE CRITERIA THAT IS USED TO SELECT THE RELATIVE ENGAGEMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE -- PROPOSED FOR THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION AND KIND OF SETTING LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FOR THOSE -- AS WELL AS THE CONSIDERATION APPROVAL IN OVERSIGHT OF THOSE PROJECTS -- THAT ARE GOING TO BE FUNDED WITH THIS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING -- THE SECOND OF WHICH IS AGAIN THIS ISSUE AROUND DUPLICATION OF EFFORT ACROSS CDT AND THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE CITY STAFF. OR BUDGETARY RESOURCES THAT ARE DUPLICATIVE -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO LEAVE THOSE RESOURCES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY -- TO THE EXTENT THAT'S HAPPENING TO BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHETHER -- THAT WILL BE THE CASE AND WHETHER OR NOT IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE REVERTED BACK TO THE STATE -- AND FINALLY AS YOU MENTIONED KIND OF THE ISSUE AROUND ONGOING FUNDING OF POSITIONS FOR THE OFFICE -- PARTICULARLY OUTLINING THE TIMELINE FOR HIRING FOLKS -- AND BRINGING THEM ON BOARD TO KIND OF STUFF THE OFFICE SO WITH THAT I'LL LEAVE IT THERE. AND LET ME ASK THEIR MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THE WISH TO COMMENT. ONE FINAL QUESTION I'M ASSUMING YOUR HOPE IS TO BRING BEST AND BRIGHTEST FROM. INNOVATIVE TECH SECTORS INTO GOVERNMENTS -- GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE INTERACTING WITH. RANK AND FILE FOLKS WHO HAVE FOR DECADES BEEN DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND HOW YOU. SEE THAT CHANGING OF THE CULTURE. SO WHAT WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE MODELS THEY THAT -- HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY OTHER PLACES THAT THEY THEY THEY BRING SORT OF A BLENDED APPROACH THEY BRING TECHNICAL EXPERTS IN FROM OUTSIDE PEOPLE WANT TO COME DO A STINT IN PUBLIC SERVICE THAT WANTED SPEND A YEAR TO WORKING ON YOU KNOW SOMETHING FOR THE GREATER PUBLIC GOOD. THEY CAN COME FROM THE OUTSIDE THEY CAN ALSO COME FROM WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND SO WE WE HAVE AN I. T. WORK FORCE OF AROUND ELEVEN THOUSAND I. T. EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S SORT OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS ON OUR HIRING ELIGIBILITY LIST SO WE HAVE WE HAVE A DEPTH OF IN HOUSE TALENT AS WELL -- AND SO WE SEE IT AS A BLEND PEOPLE COMING IN AUGMENTING OUR IN HOUSE DON'T BRING FRESH PERSPECTIVES WORKING A PROJECT TO TO AND ROLLING BACK OUT -- AS WELL AS IS WE DO PROJECTS WITH DEPARTMENTS THERE'S GOING TO BE A NATURAL A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF THIS GOING TO TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE IT HAPPENS IN REAL TIME AS WE'RE DOING THIS PROJECTS WITH APARTMENTS. AS I SAID AT THE TOP OF ABIG PIECES ABOUT INVESTING IN OUR WORK FORCE AND THAT AND THEIR SKILLS AND TOOLS THEY HAVE. GREAT WELL -- YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORKING FOR ANY -- OBVIOUSLY VERY VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW IT APPLIES -- I'VE HAD. QUITE A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH. THEN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR NOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME ON THIS VERY TOPIC AND AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. UPDATES ON YOUR HOPEFUL SUCCESSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WHEN WE MOVE TO THE NEXT ITEM? TWO ITEMS RELATED TO THE CENSUS STICK UP ISSUE SIXTEEN TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS OUTREACH DO THIS FOR YOU AND KID HOW ARE YOU. PLACE YOU CAN. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME 2% ON THE SET THE TWENTY TWENTY OUTREACH EFFORTS I'M DOES COULD TALKING AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT. TO TWENTY TWENTY OFFICE. THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDED FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION TO AUGMENT ACTIVITIES BY THE CENSUS OFFICE TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE EFFORTS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY TO ENSURE A FULL AND COMPLETE COUNT OF THE ENTIRE STATE'S POPULATION. THE MAJORITY OF THIS FUNDING WILL BE DEDICATED TO OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS THE FOCUS ON THE HARDEST ACCOUNT. OR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER COUNTED IN THE CENSUS. APPROXIMATELY FIFTY MILLION WOULD BE PROVIDED TO AUGMENT OUTREACH EFFORTS BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HELLO WELL AS THE OUTREACH AND PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN CONTRACTORS. SPECIFICALLY OUR REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WOULD RECEIVE SUPPORT FOR THE NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP PERIOD WHICH BEGINS APRIL TWENTY TWENTY AND CONTINUES THROUGH LATE JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THE ORIGINAL ALLOCATION WAS TWENTY TWO POINT NINE FIVE MILLION. AND THAT WOULD BE AUGMENTED BY TEN MILLION TO REACH COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A LOW RESPONSE RATE. TOWARD THE END OF THE ENUMERATION PERIOD. STATEWIDE CBO'S WILL HAVE AN ADDITIONAL WARD OPPORTUNITIES FOR WARTS TO FILL THE GAPS AND BE RESPONSIVE TO AREAS THAT NEED FURTHER OUT REACH. THE CURRENT BUDGET FOR THE STATEWIDE CBO'S INCLUDED FOUR POINT ZERO FIVE MILLION THAT WILL BE AUGMENTED BY APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER SIX MILLION OR FIVE POINT NINE FIVE MILLION. FOR FURTHER TARGETED OUTREACH TO THOSE HARD TO COUNT DEMOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS. IN ADDITION THE OUTREACH AND PUBLIC RELATIONS OR MEDIA CAMPAIGN WILL BE AUGMENTED BY THIRTY MILLION TO ACHIEVE A STATE WIDE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN THAT IS MULTI LINGUAL CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND ENGAGES LOCAL ETHNIC MEDIA TO BUILD OUR BASE OF TRUSTED MESSENGERS. IN SOME THIS BRINGS THE TOTAL OUT REACH FUNDING BETWEEN THE CURRENT AND NEXT FISCAL YEAR TWO ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR STATEWIDE. IN ADDITION TO THE FIFTY MILLION FOR OUTREACH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING AND POPULATION SAMPLE ENUMERATION IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET ITEM. IT PROPOSED TO SUPPORT WE CALL THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING AND POPULATION SAMPLE ENUMERATION I CALL IT GYPSY FOR SUPPORT BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF FOR SHORT IT'S KIND OF A MOUTH FULL. WHICH IS THE STUDY BEING CREATED BY CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH UNIT. THE STUDY WILL PROVIDE SEVERAL IMPORTANT DATA SETS FOLLOWING THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. THIS INCLUDES HELPING TO IDENTIFY HOW SUCCESSFUL WE WERE IN ACHIEVING A FULL AND COMPLETE COUNT. WHAT BARRIERS EXISTED THAT BLOCKED OUT REACH FOR BEING SUCCESSFUL? AND HOW CAN WE BEST PREPARE FOR THE TWENTY THIRTY CENSUS. THIS LAST POINT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CENSUS OFFICE IS WORKING DILIGENTLY NOT ONLY TO ACHIEVE A SUCCESSFUL CENSUS COUNT. FOR TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO ESTABLISH A WELL DOCUMENTED REPEATABLE OPERATION AND STRATEGY THAT WILL SERVE THE STATE AGAIN FOR THE TWENTY THIRTY CENSUS. THIS WILL SAVE TIME AND RESOURCES FOR ONE PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT CYCLE BEGINS. WITH THAT WE ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OF MASTER BERMAN FINANCE. THANK YOU IMAGE I'M WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANNA SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF AN ACCURATE AND COMPLETE CENSUS COUNT FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. AND FOR THIS REASON THE BUDGET INCLUDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- FOR STATEWIDE OUTREACH EFFORTS RELATED TO INCREASING THAT PART PARTICIPATION RATE. I HOPEWE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS AT THE PROPOSAL AND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH PAST -- LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN THIS AREA. BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT L. JUST TO STAY MY PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS -- FIRST WANT TO THANK THOSE OF YOU WHO IN WORKING WITH AND STATE GOVERNMENT UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN ON THE CENSUS AND I KNOW LAST YEAR I AND OTHERS PUSH FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING WHEN IT CAME TO THE CENSUS -- I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF THE PERSPECTIVE THAT WE ARE STILL WOEFULLY SHORT WHEN IT COMES TO TO OUT REACH -- OFTENTIMES THOSE OF US WHO ARE ELECTED OFFICE. GENERAL THERE'S MANY MANY MANY TIMES THIS TO REACH OUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS JUST EDUCATE THEM ON ONE ELECTION. AND HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- SOMETHING THAT IS OF A OF A MAGNITUDE OF WHAT'S AT STAKE SO MUCH GREATER THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL ACTION AND SO. I CERTAINLY SUPPORT I KNOW A CALL FOR MORE FUNDING AROUND OUT REGIONAL JUST MENTION THAT WHEN I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WORKING WITH THEN MAYOR GAVIN NEWSOM -- WE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT SAN FRANCISCO DOLLARS INTO HOW TO HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS INVESTING SPECIFICALLY AN OUT REACH. AND WE WERE THE ONE MAJOR COUNTY AS YOU KNOW THAT DID NOT SEE A REAL DROP IN ARE HARD TO REACH -- POPULATIONS WHEN IT CAME TO THAT CENSUS. TWENTY TEN AND SO IT'S MY PERSPECTIVE WE WE NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN -- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT EVERY DOLLAR WE INVEST TODAY WILL MEAN LITERALLY MANY MANY TIMES THAT AS FAR AS FEDERAL FUNDING WE CAN RECEIVE AND OTHER BENEFITS THE STATE COULD RECEIVE. RELATED TO CENSUS I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS BEEN A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL MEDIA OUTREACH -- WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ALSO SUPPORT GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF COMMUNICATING AND GIVEN THE SUCCESSES THAT WE SAW WHEN IT CAME TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACA. AND MEDICAL EXPANSION I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A SPECIFIC CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT HOW MUCH WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. TO INCREASE THE OUT REACH BUDGET OR THE MEDIA OUTRAGE BUDGET BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY. THIS IS AN AREA THAT I WOULD SUPPORT AND JUST A TIE FOR MEMBERS THE AUDIENCE WHO'VE BEEN HERE LISTENING TO ITEMS AROUND HOW MUCH WE SPENT ON IT. IF WE TOOK A MERE FRACTION OF WHAT WE WASTED IN I. T. O. FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND DEVOTED IT HERE. OR IN OTHER AREAS WE WOULD BE FAR BETTER OFF AS A STATE FAR BETTER OFF PHYSICALLY -- AND I THINK FOR STRONGER AS A AS A AS AS A CALIFORNIA SO I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION. LET'S NOT OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. HI MY NAME IS ARE TO OCCUR MONA AND I AM A REPRESENTATIVE OF IN BUT A MEDIA THAT OWNS -- TO PROPERTIES HERE IN. CALIFORNIA LOW PIGNON AND LOOK BEYOND IN THE BAY AREA -- FIRST OF ALL WANNA REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR I THINK THAT YOUR KNOWLEDGE ON THE OUR REACH NEEDED -- FOR THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PROCESS AROUND THE CENSUS IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO HOW TO CONNECT WITH OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES -- IN LANGUAGE COMMUNITIES AND THERE'S NO BETTER WAY THAN USING. THE MEDIA PARTICULARLY ETHNIC MEDIA UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN RURAL URBAN -- DIFFERENT AREAS AROUND THE STATE -- AND SO -- I AM HERE REPRESENTING A NUMBER OF COALITION PARTNERS INCLUDING MEMBERS THAT ARE NOT HERE TO THE MOON THOUGH -- IF THINK MEDIA SERVICE A NUMBER OF OTHERS REALLY ALL UNIFIED WITH A MESSAGE THAT -- THIS ADDITIONAL ALLOTMENT OF RESOURCES FOR OUR REACH AROUND ETHNIC MEDIA REACHES IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- AS YOU LOOK AT AN INDEPENDENT STUDY COMMISSIONED BY -- COUPLE PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE-- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE OUTRAGE DONE BY THE? AT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT A NUMBER OF OTHERS YOU REALLY ARE LOOKING AROUND TWENTY DOLLARS -- PER PERSON WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HEART TO COUNT POPULATION THAT REALLY SUMS UP -- TO I NEEDED IT -- BASS LINE OUR REACH SOME ABOUT FIFTY THREE MILLION I THINK THAT THE PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THE GOVERNOR GETS US TO ABOUT FORTY SIX MILLION VERY CLOSE. TO TO WHAT WE NEED - SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COMMITTEE AND LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT I THINK THE LOOKING AT THE MODEL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS FUNDAMENTAL. BECAUSE IT SET A BASELINE OF WHAT A GOOD AND EFFICIENT OUTREACH PROGRAM CAN DO WHEN YOU REALLY. NOT ONLY DO TRADITIONAL ALL REACH WITH -- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BUT ALSO ENGAGE THE MEDIA'S PARTNERS AND AS AS REAL PLAYERS IN THIS EFFORT SO JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU NEXT BIGGER. I WON'T REPEAT WHAT.

CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT SINCE THIS OFFICE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON A CRITICAL COMPONENT. OF OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS RELATED TO LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY THE DOLLARS ARE EARMARKED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS STRATEGY AND ASSOCIATED STANDARDS. AS OF TODAY NO OTHER STATE HAS CREATED A STREAMLINED PROCESS TO ADDRESS LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS. HOWEVER WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE LANGUAGE OF COMMUNICATION THAT LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS IS AT THE VERY HEART AND THE FRONT AND CENTER OF OUR PRIORITIES IN OUR OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. IT IS EMBEDDED VIRTUALLY IN EVERY FACET OF OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS AND THIS INCLUDES OUT REACH BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT YOU HEARD FROM REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE COMMITTEE BASS ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU ALSO HEARD FROM. AND THE PUBLIC RELATIONS MEDIA CAMPAIGN. THE CENSUS OFFICE IS CURRENTLY DRAFTING A LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS STANDARD DOCUMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE STANDARDS IS TO OUTLINE THE KEY LANGUAGE INDUSTRY CONCEPTS COMPLIANCE WITH PERTINENT LAWS AN OVER ARCHING FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE MESSAGING IS CULTURALLY RELEVANT. AND TO GUARANTEE MEANINGFUL COMMUNICATION. UNFORTUNATELY THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU DID NOT PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE IN LANGUAGE SERVICES TO LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT INDIVIDUALS AND AS YOU KNOW OUR EFFORTS ARE OUT REACH EFFORTS ARE IN SUPPORT. OF THE ACTUAL ENUMERATION OPERATIONS WHICH IS RUN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OUR LOW COST AS WHICH WE CALL OUR LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS STANDARDS OUTLINED IN DEFINES THE QUALITY OF LANGUAGE ACCESS AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES. THESE TERMS ARE SELDOM A DEFINED WITHOUT CLEARS AND WITHOUT CLEAR STANDARDS INSUFFICIENT LANGUAGE SERVICES COULD MEAN HOUSEHOLDS AND ENTIRE COMMUNITIES WILL BE OVERLOOKED AND UNDER COUNTED. IS THE GOAL OF THE CENSUS OFFICE TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS OF TRANSPARENCY IN AND CAL AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN MITIGATING ALL BARRIERS. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE ESTABLISH MECHANISM OF OUR OFFICE NEEDING TO REVIEW AND APPROVE PLANS PRIOR TO DISBURSEMENT OF ANY OF OUR STATE FUNDS FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO OUR PARTNERS. OUR OFFICE WILL FOCUS MORE ON LANGUAGE IS NOT ADDRESSED BY THE US CENSUS BUREAU AS FAR AS MATERIALS BUT OUT REACHED SHOULD STILL BE DONE IN THE LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN CALIFORNIA. WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS WE CONTINUE TO ESTABLISH OUR LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS STANDARDS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS MONTH. WE'RE PLANNING TO HAVE THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE LOW COST AT THE END OF APRIL. HOWEVER BASED ON THE EXTENT OF FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED OR HORK HOW COMPLEX IT IS WE WANT TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION FOR A TIME LINE. I JUST WANT TO SAY THEY SAY IT TAKES ABOUT A VILLAGE BUT TO REALLY GET A COMPLETE COUNT FOR CALIFORNIA IT TAKES ALL VILLAGES IN ALL COMMUNITIES. SO WITH THAT YOUR AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND I KNOW YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. HOW MUCH LANGUAGE AXIS -- COULD LIKELY BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO PARTICIPATION. IN THE CENSUS -- AND I KNOW THERE A LOT OF CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED CERTAINLY ABOUT -- THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH FOR LACK OF APPROACH TO THIS AND HOW IMPORTANT IS FOR CALIFORNIA TO TO STEP UP SO -- I FOR ONE ALONG WITH I THINK MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES WILL BE WATCHING EAGERLY HOW -- THE ADMINISTRATION CHOOSES TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS. I'M GOING TO PUT ON MY HAT AS THE CHAIR OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND REITERATE SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO OUR COMMUNITIES -- AS AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT SHOWS -- THAT THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE LEAST LIKELY TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE CENSUS. MOST LIKELY TO SAY THAT THEIR ANSWERS TO THE SENSES WILL BE USED AGAINST THEM. MOST SKEPTICAL OF THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY BELIEVE THAT CENSUS INFORMATION -- WILL BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITIES AND GENERALLY LEAST LIKELY TO PARTICIPATING GIVEN THE LANGUAGE DIVERSITY WITH THEIR I. P. I COMMUNITIES -- I WOULD JUST SAY I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED ON BEHALF OF MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND KNOWING WHAT THAT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. I KNOW THAT THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS OPTICALLY COMING FROM CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THAT HAVE LAID OUT A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS AND AND AND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD AROUND. HAVING THE STATE CREATE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT GOES FARTHER THAN THE GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED SO FAR. TRANSLATING ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES OUTSIDE OF THE FEDERALLY MANDATED ONES SPECIFYING WHAT FUNDING COULD GO TO WHICH GROUPS SPECIFYING. DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND PRIORITY LANGUAGES AND WORKING WITH CBO IS TO FULFILL THOSE PRIORITIES -- AND AND THINKING ABOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS AS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO NOT SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY OPTIONAL AND AGAIN I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THIS AND KNOW THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS PUBLICLY -- I THINK MANY OF US ARE WE'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT MAY HAPPEN AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE SHOT TO GET IT RIGHT SO -- I WOULD JUST SAY ON BEHALF OF MANY BEST PARTICULAR BEHALF OF OUR ETHNIC CAUCUSES WE WOULD LOVE -- IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS OF A BRIEFING ON WHERE THIS IS GOING TO BE SO THAT BY THE TIME THIS COMES BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A PLAN THAT WE ALL FEEL GOOD ABOUT AND ARE READY TO TO SUPPORT -- SO WITH THAT I WANT TO ASK IF -- DEPARTMENT FINANCE IF YOU ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY REALLY BRIEFLY AND THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING LANGUAGE ACCESS ISSUES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF ON THIS IS. FOR THE REST OF SPRING CAN I SHOULD SAY OUR CAUCUS SAT DOWN WITH -- THE NEW GOVERNOR AND AND WE KNOW HE GETS IT AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP TO TO MOVE THE SPORT IN A GOOD WAY -- ELIA WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS RIGHT ME ASK IF ANY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS [inaudible] IF NOT [inaudible] OKAY. LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CENTER CERAM SANTANA. REPRESENTING CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. OUR ORGANIZATION HAS A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE WORKING ON CENSUS SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE I'VE WORKED ON EVERY DECENNIAL CENSUS FOR THE PAST FIVE DECADES. AND SO. FIRST WE'D LIKE TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR PRIORITIZING LANGUAGE ACCESS IN THE STATE CENSUS OUTREACH EFFORTS. LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE. MADE A SPECIFIC REQUEST THAT A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN BE PRODUCED BY THE STATE CENSUS OFFICE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE PLAN AND THAT'S THE CURRENT DRAFT PLAN IS MISSING A LOT OF DETAILS. FOR THE CENSUS POINT FOR CALIFORNIA CENSUS EFFORTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. OUR STATE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN MUST BE ROBUST WITH DETAILS IT MUST IDENTIFY THE LANGUAGE GAPS AND ARTICULATELY STATE HOW THOSE GAPS WILL BE FILLED. THE PLAN MUST ADDRESS THE UNIQUE. LINGUISTIC COMMUNITIES OF CALIFORNIA BOTH LARGE SMALL AND SMALLER THE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE PLAN MUST BE OPERATIONAL WITH MEASURABLE -- OF DELIVERABLES SO IN IN CLOSING WE WILL. US ALONG WITH OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AND IMMIGRANT RIGHTS ORGANIZATION HAVE SUBMITTED WRITTEN. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE CENSUS OFFICE AND WE HOPE TO SEE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS REFLECTED IN THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE PLAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SPEAKER. MY ANGER I'M ACLU OF CALIFORNIA ONLINE MY COMMENTS WITH CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND STRESSED THE NEED FOR A CLEAR PLAN. THAT IS OPERATIONAL AND ROBUST HAS ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES REALLY LOOKS ON HOW IT CAN FILL IN THE STATE AND LOCAL GAPS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE FEDERAL PLAN. AND THAT REALLY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT HOW IT'S GONNA REACH SMALL LANGUAGES AND NON RIGHT LANGUAGES THANK YOU. HELLO AGAIN -- GO HERE WITH THE SOUTHEAST ASIA RESOURCE ACTION CENTER ALSO KNOWN AS C. RACK. C. RACK IS THE ONLY NATIONAL AND STATE WHY SOUTHEAST ASIAN CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH -- THOSE WHO ARE REFUGEE COMMUNITIES FROM LAOS CAMBODIA AND VIETNAM I WE WORK WITH PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS PRESSING ISSUES LIKE HEALTH EDUCATIONSENSES. AND ALSO IMMIGRATION TODAY THERE'S ABOUT ONE MILLION SOUTHEAST ASIAN THAT RESIDES IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO OUR COMMUNITIES LOW EDUCATION ATTAINMENT HIGH POVERTY RATES. AND LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT PROFICIENCY WE ARE ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA'S HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES. ALMOST 70% OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT -- AND SO REACHING OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES FOR CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY MEANS HAVING A THOUGHTFUL LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN. IN PLACE TO OUT REACHING CRITICAL LINKAGES -- INCLUDING CAMBODIAN LONG NOW AND YOU ME AND BECAUSE SOUTHEAST ASIAN COMMUNITIES ARE SMALLER OUR NEEDS ARE OFTEN INVISIBLE TO POLICY MAKERS. SINCE THE DATA IS A PRIORITY FOR OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT'S REALLY THE ONLY NATIONAL DATA -- THAT THIS AGGREGATES ARE SOUTHEAST ASIAN OR SOME OF THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN AMERICAN DATA -- INCLUDING EDUCATION COMPLETION POVERTY RATES AND HEALTH INSURANCE -- SO TO ENSURE A FULL FAIR AND ACCURATE CENSUS COUNT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES WE REALLY WANT -- TO WE HOPE THAT THIS STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS ALLOWING US TO WORK WITH YOU TO DEVELOP AN INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN. ON THAT REALLY ADDRESSES THE NEEDS FOR SMALLER LANGUAGE GROUPS AND ALSO LANGUAGE GROUPS THAT ARE NON WRITTEN. AS WELL AS LANGUAGE GROUPS LIKE THE MALL COMMUNITY WHERE THERE IS A WRITING SYSTEM BUT OFTEN TIMES -- OUR ELDERS ARE NOT LITERATE IN A WRITING SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS SO NEW -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME [inaudible] ALL. YOU NEED A DISEASE OF THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS CALIFORNIA AND A MEMBER OF THE SENSES POLICY ADVOCACY NETWORK WE WANT TO ECHO THE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID -- BEFORE US BY PHIL ADVOCATES AND ALLIES -- AND JUST WANT TO REITERATE REALLY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE -- REALLY TAKING INITIATIVE AND AND LEADING IN THE COUNTRY IN REGARDS LANGUAGE ACCESS CURRENTLY THERE WILL ONLY BE SPANISH AND ENGLISH AND PRINTED VERSION FOR THE CENSUS FORM. AND ONLINE THEY'RE ONLY DOING ABOUT TWELVE LANGUAGES AM AND NONE OF THOSE LANGUAGES ARE ACTUALLY PACIFIC ISLANDER. AND THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM AS WAS MENTIONED -- DURING THE UP A LITTLE EARLIER IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS IT'S JUST REALLY IMPORTANT IN ADDITION BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST REFUGEE COMMUNITIES. AND THE IMPORTANCE ON ENSURING THAT SPOKEN LANGUAGES. ARE CONSIDERED AS WELL FOR THOSE SMALL -- POPULATIONS AS WELL AS INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES SO WE SUPPORT THIS -- BEING HELD OPEN AND WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ARE THANK YOU. HELLO ESPERANZA AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON I WOULD CHIRLA I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT -- FELLOW ADVOCATES AND COLLEAGUES HAVE ALSO MADE -- WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO INCLUDE MORE DETAILS FRANKLIN IMPLEMENTATION AND MORE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN THAT CAN FILL THAT GAP AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. OF FOR EXAMPLE HOW TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF IMMIGRANTS WHO DO NOT SPEAK EITHER ENGLISH OR SPANISH. I AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN CONSIDERS NON WRITTEN LANGUAGES AS WELL -- WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE CREATION THE CREATION OF UNIFORMITY RULES THAT ARE THAT ARE TRULY CULTURALLY COMPETENT THANK YOU. HI FAMILIES -- WITH ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIA WE ARE ONE OF THE CO SIGNERS ON THE LETTER OF RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE CURRENT CENSUS LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN -- I WOULD UNDERSCORE THAT THE BUREAU CONTINUES TO EXCLUDE DIGITAL SURVEYS IN LONG PUNJAB BE MY TIE MARSHALLESE IN TONGAN AMONG MANY IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA LANGUAGES -- WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF LEAVING THIS ITEM OPEN AND CONTINUING CONVERSATION ON MANDATING AND NOT JUST -- SUGGESTING LANGUAGE ACCESS AS A MATTER AS A PRIORITY FOR OUR SENSES -- AND THAT THE FAILURE TO CONFRONT AND ADDRESS THE ON THE GROUND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH LANGUAGE WILL -- JEOPARDIZE THE EFFICACY OF ALL OF OUR STATE DOLLARS PUT INTO THE CENSUS THANK YOU. NO I BOTTOM ALL CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION STAND IN SUPPORT OF A STRONG. LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN AND APPLAUD THE EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY CRUCIAL FOR A COMMUNITIES WORKING WITH FARMWORKERS 90% ARE FROM MEXICO ONE IN THREE OF THOSE FARMWORKERS ARE FROM A COMMUNITY OTHER. THAN -- SPANISH SPEAKING AND THESE ARE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES ARE SPEAK EITHER MYSTICAL TRICKY ARTS OPTICAL SO IT'S GOING TO BE A A CHALLENGE TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND SO WE NEED TO REDUCE THOSE BARRIERS AND WORKING WITH THEM AND YOU TRUSTED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THESE MESSENGERS. THEY NEED TO GO BEYOND JUST PURELY. TRANSLATING INFORMATION THEY'RE GONNA NEED TO WORK WITH SOMEONE ON ONE HAND RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET IS NOT GOING TO DO IT WE NEED TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITIES SO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS. LANGUAGE ACCESS PLANS CAN BE INSTRUMENTAL IN MOVING FORWARD WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. I THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT HAVE COME OUT FOR THIS ITEM YOU ARE CERTAINLY REFLECTING AT LEAST SOME OF THE DIVERSITY OF WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SENSES COUNT AND I THINK WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT STEPS -- ON THIS PLAN AND IN STAY TUNED.
