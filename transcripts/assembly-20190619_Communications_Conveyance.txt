TO START ON THE COMMITTEE NOW -- NOTICING THAT WE HAVE AN ABSENCE OF A QUORUM -- WILL BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE OUR FIRST PRESENTER -- MISTER HILL WHAT? NO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS ON THIS BILL APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. SB -- SIX TWENTY FIVE MEMBERS A LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW MAKES IT LEGAL FOR EIGHT PASSENGERS FOR PASSENGERS TO SMOKE CANNABIS IN A PARTY BUS. LIMO TAXI OR TNC. AS A RESULT SOME PARTY BUSES AND LIMO OPERATORS ARE OFFERING CANNABIS DISPENSARY TOUR IT'S SIMILAR TO EXISTING TOWARDS FOR WINERIES OR BROUGH REACH. MODELED AFTER STATUTES FOR BEER AND WINE BUSES IN LIMOS SB SIX TWENTY FIVE WILL PROHIBIT. CANNABIS USE IN THESE VEHICLES AND LET'S SAFETY STANDARDS ARE FOLLOWED. SPECIFICALLY SB SIX TWENTY FIVE MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR A PASSENGER IN A PARTY BUS OR LÃ  M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. TO&lt;/c&gt;</u> SMOKE OR VAPOR CANNABIS AND LESS THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT IS SEALED OFF SEPARATELY. AND SET IN SEPARATELY VENTILATED THE BILL ALSO PROHIBITS ANYONE UNDER TWENTY ONE FROM BEING ON BOARD IF CANNABIS BALK IS PRESENT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL. IS TO ENSURE THAT THE DRIVER IS NOT IMPAIRED IF CANNABIS SMOKE IS CONSUMED IN ONE OF THESE FOR HIGHER VEHICLES. I WANT TO REINFORCE THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW. CANNABIS USE IS ALLOWED IN BUSES LIMOS AND TAXIS WITHOUT ANY REGULATION OR CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS THAT'S WHICH IN LAW TODAY. SB SIX TWENTY FIVE IS NECESSARY TO CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE AND APPROPRIATELY REGULATE THESE BUSINESSES WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE OPPOSITION AND HAD AND HAVE COME UP WITH A SET OF ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS IN THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE COMMITTED TO MAKING THESE AMENDMENTS IN ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING. LIMIT THE BILL COULD JUST BUSES IN LIMOS. REQUIRE THAT THESE OPERATORS MEET ALL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR CHARTER PARTY CARRIERS INCLUDING PERMITTING BY THE P. YOU SEE AN INSPECTIONS BY THE HIGHWAY PATROL. REQUIRE A THIRD PARTY LICENSED ENGINEER TO VERIFY THAT THE VEHICLES PARTITION EFFECTIVELY LIMITS THE PASSENGER. THE PASSAGE OF SMOKE TO THE DRIVER. AND ADD RIEN AT ENFORCEMENT LANGUAGE THAT SUBJECT FOR OPERATORS TO PENALTIES AND PERMIT REVOCATION. FOR VIOLATING THE LAW I FEEL THESE AMENDMENTS STRIKE A BALANCE THAT ALLOWS FOR CANNABIS USE ON BUSES IN LIMOS WHILE PROTECTING THE DRIVER. PASSENGERS AND CONSUMERS ASKED OF THE COMMITTEE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD TODAY AS WE MAKE IT SO WE CAN MAKE THE NECESSARY AMENDMENTS IN ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION AND CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE. I DO HAVE WITNESSES THANK. MANNER UP JUST FOR SECOND SINCE WE HAVE A QUORUM I WANT TO STAB WISH THAT -- MINUTES SECTOR PLEASE CALL ROLE SANTIAGO HERE OBERNOLTE.

TO INTO THE COMMITTEE -- IN COLORADO THERE ARE BUSES THAT DO HAVE SEPARATE -- KIND OF ISOLATED CABINS FOR THE DRIVERS SHOULD AND SEALED OFF SO THAT THERE IS NO PENETRATION OF THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING. TO TO KIND OF COPY HERE -- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THIRD PARTY ENGINEER DESIGNS AND INSPECTS AND REALLY CAN CERTIFY. THAT IT IS -- IT'S IT'S ONLY ISOLATED SO ONCE SO THERE IT WILL NOT BE WHO THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO UTILIZE CANNABIS. IN THE US UNTIL SUCH TIME ABOUT STATE THAT'S IT THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT TODAY ACTUALLY SO THEY DON'T KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WITH THE PASSAGE WITH THE SENATE ALL WOULD NOT BE APPROVED -- IT WOULD NOT BE USED UNTIL -- THERE IS THAT CERTIFICATION OF THAT VEHICLE AND THAT IT IS SAFE. TROUT. I THANK YOU. IT'S ONE TAKE A OF JUST A POINT OF COURTESY AND AND WE HAVE A LATE COMER TO I I BELIEVE EITHER OPPOSE OR SUPPORT. HOW DOES A COURTESY?

WE HAVE A FIRST OR SECOND APOLOGIZE MA'AM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WASHES DUPONT'S TO COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION SANTIAGO HI SANTIAGO I OBERNOLTE FOR THE WHOLE THAT. BONTA. BONTA AYE BRO. BROWN NOT VOTING CERVANTES. EDUARDO GARCIA. HOLDEN. HOLDEN I CAN LOOK IT UP. CA.GOV I'D LOW. LOW ON A PATTERSON. PATTERSON NOT VOTING FOLKS OVER. RODRIGUEZ. RODRIGUEZ SIGH [inaudible] SO CALLED. MEASURES ON CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR THANK YOU PUBLIC THANK YOU. I SEE MISTER WESLEY READY TO PRESENT ON SB [inaudible] TWO EIGHT ALREADY [inaudible] THE BILL. I HAD GUESTS SO. THANK YOU AND YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A. B. OUR I'M SORRY SB TO AVOID IT'S A CONSUMER CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL. AIMED AT PREVENTING WROBEL CALL SCAMS. YOU KNOW WHEN I HEARD THAT BY. MADE IN YOUR TELEPHONE. IT'S GONNA BE A FAKE CALL. A COMPUTER GENERATED CALL AIMED. AT TAKING YOUR MONEY. I SAID WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. 40% OF EVERY SINGLE CALL MADE ON YOUR TELEPHONE. NOT ONLY THAT -- SCAM IN HAS BECOME A NINE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN AMERICA SORRY THOSE NINE HUNDRED MILLION. I HAD TO BE TO IT. STILL NINE HUNDRED MILLION. IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND NORMALLY THIS MONEY COMES FROM THE MOST VULNERABLE. IN OUR COMMUNITY USUALLY IT'S THE ELDERLY. USUALLY IT'S DISABLED THESE PEOPLE ARE TARGETED BY THIS THE MASS GENERATION OF THESE CALLS. THIS BILL [inaudible] WOULD REQUIRE THAT A CALLER ID SYSTEM BE PUT IN PLACE BY THE TELECOMMUTE. TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES THIS BILL SETS A JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINES FOR THAT TO BE DONE -- THIS WOULD REQUIRE THAT OUR CALLER AUTHENTICATION -- PROGRAM BE -- INSTALLED. INTO EVERYBODY'S ACCOUNT SO THAT -- THESE CALLS ARE PREVENTED. AND LARGELY I JUST WANTED TO MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR. THIS -- TARGETS SPOOFING. IT DOES NOT EXPAND THE CPU SEES AUTHORITY. IT NARROWLY ALLOWS THE CPUC TO WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST ILLEGAL ROBO CALLERS. SO MOSTLY THAT WOULD TAKE IT A SHAPE IN THE FIFTH AND AND IN THE WAY OF IDENTIFYING. OR OR GATHER INFORMATION GATHERING COMPLAINTS -- GATHERING INFORMATION. BAND THAT COULD GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ENFORCE THIS. IT ALSO DOES NOT REQUIRE CALL BLOCKING. CALL BLOCKING THE IS NOT SOMETHING THIS BILL LAST TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO DO. AND IT ALSO WOULD NOT RESULT IN REAL CALLS BEING BLOCKED BECAUSE THIS -- THIS IDENTIFIER SYSTEM WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY SIMPLY LOOKS FOR COMPUTER GENERATED CALLS. DOES THE THE THAT -- ONLY THOSE THAT DO NOT IMPLEMENT CALLER ID. AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS AND USUALLY THOSE WOULD BE -- THE THE ROBO CALLS. THOSE THAT DO NOT -- COMPLETE THAT WOULD BE A COMMITTEE LED A VIOLATION OF THE LAW UNDER THIS BILL. THIS BILL WOULD HELP RESTORE COMPETE CONSUMERS CONFIDENCE IN THEIR TELEPHONE. IT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE. FAKE CALLS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OR CITIES -- PULL OR EVEN THE IRS. WE'LL HAVE RECEIVE CALLS FROM. OF SPOOFING CALLS THAT HAVE A I ARRESTS CALL IDENTIFIER OR A THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO OR CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO OR CITY. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO GET PEOPLE TO ANSWER THE PHONES. SO THEY COULD SCAM THEM. PLEASE JOIN ME IN THIS EFFORT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TREMENDOUS PROBLEM AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANKS FOR WHAT IS IT. YEAH. THANK YOU CHAIR -- MEMBERS MY NAME IS VINCENT LAY WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. FOCUS ON RACIAL EQUITY IN ENSURING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL BECAUSE FRAUD AND DECEPTIVE CALLS STILL IT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AWAY. OUR FATHERS NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FRAUD THE ADDITIONAL COST TO THE ECONOMY IS. NEARLY TEN BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. AND THE PEOPLE MOST AFFECTED OUR SENIORS -- BLACK IN THE NEXT COMMUNITIES. I YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW THE SENATOR SAID SCAMMERS ARE POSING AS THE IRS -- OR SOCIAL SECURITY I GOT A CALL LAST WEEK -- TELLING ME MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THAT WAS CANCELED AND A CALL BACK AND THEY'RE DOING THIS IS STILL ID'S FROM PEOPLE THEIR IDENTITIES. AND THEY ARE EVEN STEALING FOOD BENEFITS FROM FOLKS BY POSING AS A DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. YOU KNOW THIS TO BE KIND OF THINGS UNDERMINE TRUST IN THE PHONE SYSTEM BUT ALSO OUR INSTITUTIONS. SO WE MUST QUICKLY TAKE ACTION TO STOP THIS AND FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IF YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ARE NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ -- HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIAN ALSO ON BEHALF OF TURN. IN SUPPORT THE BILL AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. OTHERS BEEN A LOT OF WORK ON THIS ISSUE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT FEDERAL LEVEL AND STATE LEVEL. AND REALLY WE'VE ARRIVED AT A POINT WHERE THERE IS TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AVAILABLE -- AND WITH THIS BILL REALLY. NO DOZEN WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT DOLLARS JUST SET THE TIME CERTAIN -- THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED TO HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- AS BOTH THE AUTHOR THE WITNESS STATED -- THIS PROBLEM IS GROWING IT'S GROWING EXPONENTIALLY AND IT'S NOT JUST GROWN AND AS FAR AS NUMBER AND VOLUME BUT IT'S GROWN IN THE TYPE OF SCAMS THAT ARE OCCURRING. I HEARD SOME OF THE EXAMPLES BUT WE'VE ALSO HAD FOR EXAMPLE SAN DIEGO -- WHERE THE NUMBER CAME UP WAS IF IT WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEN THE? AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT THERE WAS A WARRANT THAT WAS A THAT WAS OUT AND IF YOU DIDN'T PAY -- FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FIVE DOLLARS ON THE SPOT OVER THE PHONE -- THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ARREST THAT WOULD BE OCCURRING SO THINGS LIKE THAT ARE GOING ON OVER AND OVER AS THE AUTHOR INDICATED THERE'S SPOOFING OF CITIES COUNTIES. STATE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT SOME THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH THIS BILL REALLY TAKES AN EVEN HANDED APPROACH -- IN CALIFORNIA AND GIVE SOME ASSURANCE AND CONFIDENCE THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE USED -- BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S REALLY ALL THIS BILL DOES WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY CANNOT SIT AND WAIT AND HOPE THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS. AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL AN OUNCE FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WITNESSES. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JAMES JACK ON BEHALF OF CAL TELL -- CAL TELL HAS HAD A A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION SINCE THE BILL WAS HEARD AND TENDER PLACES COMMITTEE -- OUR MEMBERS ARE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE PROTOCOLS IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR -- WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH SENATORS OFFICE TO ADDRESS ONE REMAINING -- PORTION OF THE BILL -- WHEN THE BILL HOPEFULLY GETS PRIVACY COMMITTEE AND WILL BE OFFERING OUR FULL SUPPORT AT THAT TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU? HI TERRY DAIS SANDERS REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE FROM LADY OUR OFFICE REPAIR ADVOCATES IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TO IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE GO TO A MAIN OPPOSITION WITNESSES. THANK YOU MIGHT MAKE SOME ROOM FOR THEM PLEASE THANK YOU. MR CARE MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO TO CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION. CCT IS -- CURRENTLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SENATOR HOPING TO GET TO A SOME RESOLUTION. BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH -- IMPLEMENTING THE STERN SHAKEN OR COMPARABLE TECHNOLOGY TO BLOCK LOCAL CALLS -- WE AGREE WITH EVERYTHING FOLKS THE CENTER HAS SAID ANOTHER HAVE SAID THIS IS THE SCOURGE OF THE OF THE LAND RIGHT NOW BOTHERING PEOPLE AND OUR CUSTOMERS GET UPSET. SO WE HAVE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED WITH THE FCC AND FORTY STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH A PROPER PROTOCOLS -- TO IMPLEMENT AT TO TO BLOCK THESE CALLS AND SO -- WE APPRECIATE -- AG PESETAS INVOLVEMENT HE'S ONE OF THE FORTY ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE FCC RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE HOPING TO SEE PROGRESS LAST THURSDAY THE FCC MADE SOME ADDITIONAL -- REQUIREMENTS -- FOR COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS ONE OF THEM IS NOW WE IN THE INTERIM BEFORE THIS CHICKEN AND STIR A COMPARABLE TECHNOLOGY IS ADOPTED WE HAVE TO OFFER TO OUR CUSTOMERS. APPS THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BLOCK THESE CALLS THE DEFAULT SITUATION IS CALLS ARE BLOCKED -- THE THEY WILL HAVE THIS APP BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS WE HAVE THIS APP THAT THEIR SERVICE. WE HAVE TO PROPERLY INFORM THEM THAT WE WERE PUTTING THEM ON THIS PROGRAM AND THAT THE DEFAULT IS IT'S BLOCK UNLESS YOU ARE YOU'RE IN THE PROGRAM. AND YOU HAVE TO OPT OUT SO THE CUSTOMERS HAVE DROPPED OUT. THIS JUST HAPPENS OVER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT SO WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. WITH WITH SHAKEN AND STIR WITH% SB TO AWAIT. THE DATE CERTAIN IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR US AND SO WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON IN THIS AS WELL -- WE DO HAVE SOME KIND OF PROCEDURAL CONCERNS AT THIS POINT. AND ONE OF THEM IS WITH THE LIABILITY PROTECTION -- CERTAINLY NOW WITH THE FCC MAKING ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT -- CUSTOMERS BE AUTOMATICALLY PUT INTO A PROGRAM TO BLOCK ROBOCALLS. WE LIKE TO SEE IS THAT -- IN THE EVENT THAT IN GOOD FAITH THAT IF WE WERE TO BLOCK A CALL THAT WAS A CRITICAL EMERGENCY ALERT -- AND BEST INTENTION IS NOT TO DO THAT AND NOT TO BLOCK IT BUT AGAIN THIS IS BRAND NEW PRO -- BRANDS SOFTWARE THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT DONE SO WE'RE WORKING ON IT WE HOPE THAT WERE BETA TESTING IT RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE EIGHTEEN TEASE BETA TESTING. COMCAST IS BETA TESTING THAT SO IT'S NOT COMPLETE SO WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF COMPLYING WITH THIS REQUIREMENT BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. BUT YOU KNOW BETTER INTENTIONS -- WE WE JUST HOPE THAT WE DO COULD GET TO COMPLETE THAT SO WITH SOME SORT OF LIABILITY PROTECTION THAT WOULD BE CRITICAL FOR US. MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE PC PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND I AND I UNDERSTAND I HEAR THE CENTER SAY THAT THERE IS NO NEW OBLIGATIONS -- GIVEN TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN THIS PROVISION. BUT AS YOU READ -- SUBSECTION SEE ONE AND SEE TO I MEAN THERE'S THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE ENFORCEMENT THAT THAT SECTION. TWO TWO SEVEN OF TITLE FORTY SEVEN IS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT IT'S NOT ABOUT US ADOPTING REGULATIONS US DOING SOMETHING IT'S ABOUT. GOING AFTER THE BAD WROBEL CALLERS THAT'S WHAT SECTION -- TWO TWO SEVEN SAYS. SO THE AG HAS TO TAKE THESE BAD ACTORS INTO FEDERAL COURT IT'S NOT A STATE COURT YOU HAVE TO GO TO FEDERAL COURT. MOST RUBBER CALLERS ARE NOT IN STATE A MOST OF THEM QUITE A FEW OF THEM ARE OVERSEAS. SO THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED MATTER OF SUMMER USING COMPLICATED SOFTWARE A COMPLICATED ENFORCEMENT MEASURE -- WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY SAY THAT THE P. UC'S INVOLVEMENT AND TRYING. TO GATHER THE PROPER INFORMATION IS PROBABLY NOT BEST SUITED FOR THEM - MISTER CHAIR YOU HAVE TODAY UNDER CURRENT LAW SEVEN TEN THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO YOU -- COMPLAINTS ABOUT WHAT SERVICE BY THAT REQUIREMENTS BEEN IN PLACE FOR SEVEN YEARS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO REPORT THAT TO YOU ANNUALLY AT YOUR HEARINGS YOUR ANNUAL HEARING AND ANNUALLY IN A REPORT. AND AS FAR AS I CAN RECALL NOT ONCE HAVE THEY PROVIDE YOU ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT COMPLAINTS. WE KNOW THERE ARE QUITE COMPLAINTS BECAUSE WHEN THE PEWS HE WILL GET ONE THEY WILL REFER THEM TO US AND WE WILL RESOLVE THOSE ARE OUR TICKETS THAT WE WILL RESOLVE. BUT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THEY'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE AND THEY REALLY HAVEN'T SO AND THAT WAS JUST REFERRING COMPLAINTS CITY GIVEN YOUR FROM ABOUT COMPLAINTS NOW IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE SOMETHING AS COOL. AS COMPLICATED IN CRITICAL AS MOBILE KHÃ´NG FORSMAN ON A NATIONAL LEVEL -- WE WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT THAT IT'S NOT A ROLE PROP PROPER FOR THEM SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT PRINT WITHOUT. A PIECE OF THE BILL AMENDED TO REMOVE THE THE COMMISSION -- BUT AGAIN WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BLOCKING ROBO CALLS OUR CUSTOMERS COMPLAIN JUST AS MUCH AS YOUR CONSTITUENTS COMPLAIN SENATOR SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO OUR BASS. WITH THAT -- I WILL. READ MISTER HOUSE THEY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON FOR CTIA THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE NEW WITH THAT THE THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- AN ADULT IT WASN'T THE SUGGESTION OF THE OF THE SENATOR BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SUGGESTION BY THE WITNESSES IS THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER. WE'RE NOT DOING WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING ON THIS AND THAT'S JUST A THAT'S NOT A FACT -- WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE FCC ON THE SO CALLED CHICKEN STIR PROTOCOLS TO HER BERNIE DESCRIBED THE REASON ACTION ON BEHALF OF THE FCC WHICH HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THIS AREA. OF CONGRESS IS ALSO LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE -- OUR CONCERN IS HAVING A DIFFERENT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM AT THE STATE LEVEL VERSUS THE FEDERAL LEVEL. COULD BE COULD BE CONCERNING AND EVEN THOUGH WE ALL HATE ROBO CALLS -- AND BOOK TALK TO THE THE SENATOR AND STAFF ABOUT THIS WE'RE NOT THE BAD GUYS IN THIS YOU KNOW THERE ARE. A LOT OF BAD GUYS WORKING VERY HARD TO PREVENT THE BAD GUYS FROM FROM DOING THIS. WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR ON IT MAYBE -- WORKING OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES -- THAT BERNIE HAS -- HAS HAS INDICATED WE WOULD -- WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT -- BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE'RE DOING ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE CAN. IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS MAKE THIS HAPPEN -- WE WANT IT TO HAPPEN AS AS AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY ELSE -- ONE OF THE THINGS THE COMMITTEE SHOULD ALSO KNOW AS BERNIE ALLUDED. TO MANY ROBO CALLS ARE ARE -- INTENTIONAL AND ARE ARE ARE BENEFICIAL YOU GET A COFFEE OR PHARMACY GET A CALL FROM THE SCHOOL -- YOU GET EMERGENCY ALERT CALLS WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT THROWING OUT THE BABY WITH THE BATH WATER AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN TARGET THESE -- IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY -- SO WITH THAT BUT MANY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR I'M AND HIS STAFF ON THIS ISSUE BUT FOR NOW WE WE WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OTHER THAT YOU'RE AT THE PRESENT ANOTHER BILL ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON DOMINIC TOMORROW HERE BEHALF OF FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED ALSO OPPOSE. CAME TO ME TRÃªN BAFFERT TECHNION ALSO OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE BRING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SIMILAR PATTERSON. I WANT TO JUST IT UP EXPLORE COUPLES I I HAVE A LONG HISTORY WITH. THE FCC BROADCAST OWNER OPERATOR STAYS. THE CONCERN I HAVE IS. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THE THAT THIS IS A INTERNATIONAL ISSUE AS WELL DOES OF STE. CROSS UNITED STATES -- SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE BEST PLACE FOR THIS. IS THAT THE FCC AND WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S -- MY CONCERN IS THAT INSERTING. ARE THE P. YOU SEE INTO THIS I ACTUALLY THINK IS GOING TO WORK AGAINST THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. AGAIN AS VICE CHAIR OF THE UTILITY AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. THE P. YOU SEE IN MY JUDGMENT. REALLY DOES NOT EXECUTED -- EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. IN ANY OF THESE AREAS AND PARTICULARLY I THINK IN THE INTERNET SPACE THIS REALLY IS AN AREA WHERE IT OUGHT. TO IT REALLY OUGHT TO BE OUT OUTSIDE OF THEIR OF THEIR PURVIEW -- SO. WHAT IS IT? IN ADDITION TO OUR APART FROM WHAT THE FCC IS DOING. AND WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SERRA. IS DOING AND WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER ELIMINATING THE P. YOU SEE AND THEN. FOLLOW UP TO THAT WOULD BE. EXPLAIN THE NECESSITY FOR THE BILL. IF WE'VE GOT THE FCC AND THAT'S OUR TWENTY GENERAL ENGAGED IN THIS TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY ARE. THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ENGAGED ISN'T. THE IT'S PART OF THE SOLUTION THEY HAVEN'T COME TO A SOLUTION AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR A NATION WIDE SOLUTION. THAT HE IS STILL FAR FROM US SO. I THINK CALIFORNIA COULDN'T PAVE THE WAY TOWARD A SOLUTION I THINK WE HAVE A VERY -- THOROUGH SOLUTION -- THE P. YOU SEE IS NOT THE LEADER. IN IN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. NOT EVEN CLOSE THEY ARE ONLY A VERY. SMALL SMALL PART OF THE BILL IN FACT I DON'T SEE HOW THEM EVEN BEING PART OF THE BILL HERTZ ENFORCEMENT IN ANY WAY A TO GIVE YOU AN ANALOGY. IF MY CHILD WAS KIDNAPPED. AND I WENT. TO THE FBI IN THE POLICE AND THEY SAID WEL. THIS IS YOU KNOW I I I'M NOT ALLOWED BY LAW. TO TO GET INVOLVED THIS IS A LOCAL MATTER. I I AS A PARENT I WOULD WANT EVERY RESOURCE I WOULD WANT THE FBI THE SHERIFF'S THE POLICE EVERYONE TO DO AN ALL OUT SEARCH FOR MY CHILD. WHAT IT WHAT IT PUTTING MORE RESOURCES INTO SOLVING A PROBLEM BE BETTER AT SOLVING THAT PROBLEM? SO THE ROLE THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE PC IS A VERY SMALL ROLE IT'S A SUPPORTING ROLE. AND IT'S WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ANYWHERE THE THE APPEAL SEE. HAS ANY ABILITY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. SOME INFORMATION COULD BE CRITICAL TO APPREHENDING. SOMEBODY THAT'S DOING SOMETHING WRONG OR FIGURING OUT WHAT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WHY ARE THESE CALLS PERSISTING. IF CALIFORNIA HAS A LAW ON WE HAVE A TECHNOLOGY THE PC COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. AND WE'VE REACHED OUT TO PAY YOU SEE TO FIND WHAT THAT ROLE COULD BE AND WE'VE ACTUALLY GONE TO DIFFERENT APARTMENTS TO ASK WHAT THEIR ROLE COULD BE. AND WE'VE GONE -- WE'VE TALKED TO THE ATTORNEYS TURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE AND WE SAID WHAT WHAT WOULD HOW COULD WE HELP YOU ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE SUCCESS. GENERALLY PEOPLE WANT. SUPPORT PEOPLE WANT MORE RESOURCES AND PEOPLE WANT ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL. THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT EMPOWERS A P. YOU SEE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT. A BILL THAT REQUIRES A P. YOU SEE THAT SOLVES A PROBLEM IT DOESN'T MAKE THE P. YOU SEE. THE THE THE LEADER IN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM IT IS SIMPLY PROVIDING A SUPPORTING ROLE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND TO THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS WHO ALSO HAVE. A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE. THAT THE PROVIDING THE SERVICE THAT YOU WE ARE ALL PAID -- FOR HAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. REQUESTED THIS LEGISLATION NO. REQUESTED I COULDN'T SAY THAT HE REQUESTED IT. THIS IS A LEGISLATION THAT WAS DEVELOPED WITH THAT MY OFFICE AND WE HAVE CONSULTED DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND DIFFERENT CONSUMER GROUPS. WE HAVE GONE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO I HOPE THAT TODAY. AND THE TESTIMONY THE HEARING TODAY'S KIND OF INDICATIVE OF WHO. HIS IS AT THE TABLE WHO WHO HAS REVIEWED THIS BILL WHO HAS SEEN -- THAT THIS BILL COULD BE USEFUL OR HELPFUL AND AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE INDUSTRY I UNDERSTAND. THEIR JOB IS YEAH IS IS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE TO REDUCE LIABILITY TO REDUCE. A GOVERNMENT REGULATION TO LIMÃ³N. EIGHT ARE OUR YOU KNOW US WANTED TO COME IN AND SAY WE NEED YOU TO DO THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT I I'M NOT CRITICAL. OF THE INDUSTRY AND I I HAVE TO SAY THE INDUSTRY'S BEEN WORKING VERY WELL. WITH MY OFFICE AND WE'VE MET ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR CONCERNS. AND I'M AND THEY RAISE SOME ISSUES. THAT DESERVE OUR ATTENTION. AND I'M LISTENING TO THEM AND I'M I'M TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM. WITHOUT MAKING THIS BILL. ANOTHER A DO NOTHING BILL. IT BEHOOVES US ALL THIS IS OUR JOB THIS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THIS IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM. AND I WANT TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS WELL THIS IS SOMETHING'S JUST. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T DO THINGS. REQUIRE SOMETHING WITHOUT AN OFFRAMP THE SAME THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE AMENDMENT TO REQUEST SEEN THEIR AMENDMENTS IT IS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED MAKE THE BILL. A NOTHING BILL AND I AND I KNOW. I YOU KNOW THEY HAVE WE WE HAVE KICKED AROUND SOME IDEAS AND AND ON YOU KNOW WHAT I AT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET THEIR OWN LANGUAGE BUT WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET THERE. IN A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET THERE IN SOME INTENT LANGUAGE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE P. YOU SEE TAKE YOU WANTING A CHOOSING. TO MAYBE NOT IGNORING THE RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THIS BILL IN CHOOSING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE IT. LET WHAT IT WOULD NOT BE CORRECT THEY WOULD BE WRONG IN DOING THAT UNDER THIS BILL THE BILL I WHEN I LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE ALL THIS LANGUAGE REQUIRES HIM TO DO. IS TO PUT EMPLOYMENT A COLOR I'D AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM IT'S ALL IT DOES. IT DOESN'T SAY THAT IT HAS TO WORK IT DOESN'T SAY THAT OUR HOUSE. TO BLOCK EVERY SINGLE CALL IT OR EVERY SINGLE OF SPOOFING CALL -- THE THE BILL BILL IS PRETTY SIMPLE [inaudible] SO [inaudible] THE THE DOES THE BILL IN YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF IT. UP PROVIDE PROTECTION -- FOR LIABILITY WHEN SOMETHING SLIPS THROUGH THE CRACKS AND IT'S UNINTENTIONAL. OR IS THIS IS JUST THROWING THEM ALL IN A BASKET THAT SAYS IF YOU MESS UP ONCE. YOUR GUILTY AGAIN YOU COULD ARGUE THAT OF EVERY BILL AND EVERY ABSENCE OF A BILL. YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE LAWS THAT ARE CREATED BY THE JUDICIARY WHEN WE FAIL TO CONNECT THEM. AND THERE ARE LAWSUITS THAT ARE TRIGGERED. BY AN ABSENCE OF A LAW AS MUCH AS THEY ARE BY THE EXISTENCE OF A LOST SOUL. THE WAY I TRIED TO REDUCE THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE WAY WE WROTE THIS BILL BUT ALSO IN THE WAY THAT. IT REQUIRES. THAT THE TICKET TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES DO THAT SO. IT REQUIRES THEM TO DO SOMETHING. AND IF THEY DON'T DO THAT. THIS BILL MUCH FRONT END IN ONE FILE FOLLOW AT THAT THE QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO LEGITIMATE ROBO CALLS YEAH -- TO ME. IF THE ARMS SIGN A LEGITIMATE ROBO CALL. WELL THAT THE EXAMPLES WERE GIVEN HERE YOUR PHARMACIST -- BECAUSE YOU SAYS THAT YOU HAVE THAT DOES THAT IT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT COMPUTER GENERATED FOR THAT DAY ARE COMPUTER GENERATED NO NO I I UNDERSTAND BUT THESE ARE CALLS -- THAT ARE ARE. ARE GENERATED BY. USING A FAKE ID USE IN OF A MISLEADING. OF GEN NADER. NOW IF OF PHARMACISTS MAKES A CALL FROM HIS OFFICE OR FROM YOU HIRES A SERVICE. A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS SERVICE THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT. THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THOSE CALLS. TO A COMING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT COMES THROUGH THE THAT LOOKS LIKE A REBEL CALL IS THAT TECHNOLOGY SUFFICIENT. TO BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO YES BECAUSE IF IT I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- IT'S SIMILAR. IF YOU EVER GONE TO A WEB PAGE OR SOMETHING AND IT REQUIRES YOU TO THE TO CONFIRM THAT YOU'RE A PERSON. AND IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE LINE IT SAYS. RIGHT WHAT THIS READ TODAY HAS A CURSIVE. IT'LL READ CAT IN CURSIVE. AND YOU PUT YOUR PUNCH AND CA T. AND AND YOU PRESS CENTER. THAT IS AN AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM IT'S VERY SIMILAR. SO THE CALL IS BEING GENERATED BY A COMPUTER COMPUTER CAN. INTERPRET THAT HE COULD INTERPRET THE CURSIVE WORD FOR CATS OR WHAT EVER -- AUTHENTICATION IMPEDIMENT IS PUT BEFORE. THE THE COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT IS IN THE AREA OF WHAT WERE WORK WE'RE TRYING TO THE WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD -- BE SIMILAR.

WHAT WOULD END UP HAPPENING IN SHOULD BE HAPPENING NOW BUT SECONDLY IT DOESN'T -- IS THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY WOULD WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH CALLAWAY YES PROVIDE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE OUTAGE. THE PRODUCT THE ESTIMATED TIME TO RESTORE THE OUTAGE AND A CONTACT PERSON THAT CALLAWAY IS CAN REACH. FOR FURTHER UPDATES SO WE'RE GETTING REAL TIME UPDATES YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THE FIRE CHIEF TODAY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR PARTNER IN ALL THIS CENTER NIELSEN. ALL OF THE SYSTEMS REQUIRE A LOT OF INNER CONNECTIVE ITTY. ANY POINT OF FAILURE. AND DISASTERS CAN HAPPEN. NOW WE ALWAYS HAVE DISASTERS BUT SOME OF US HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME COLOSSAL HISTORIC ONCE. AND WE'VE SEEN HOW COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES. CAN COST LIVES.
