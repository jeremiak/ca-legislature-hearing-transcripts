THANK YOU THEY ARRESTING MR FONG WE ARE RECOGNIZED I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AS WITH THE PRIOR MO YOU BUILT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SEVEN DOOR TO AN EXTREMELY EXTRAORDINARY AND EXTREMELY DEMANDING YEAR AND OUR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS HAVE CERTAINLY FACED TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES AS COVER NINETEEN HIT OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES EXPRESSION. EXPRESSION A SEX. ESPECIALLY HARD. THIS MO YOU RESTORES A PAY CUT THEY TOOK AND PROVIDES NEEDED ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ACTORS AND I'VE OUT. THANK YOU MISTER FOR MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. AS PROBABLY MANY OF YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM SEVEN CALIFORNIA. I'M PROBABLY IF NOT. ONE THAT SHOULD VOTE NO ON THIS. I PROBABLY HAVE MORE REASONS. PROBABLY A COUPLE MILLION REASONS WHY I SHOULD VOTE NO ON THIS. BUT I'M ALSO AN SEIU MEMBER. WHEN I WAS WITH THE CITY OF LA WHEN WE WENT THROUGH HARD BUDGET TIMES AS A UNION MEMBER I REMEMBER TAKING CUTS SUSPENDING OUR SALARIES FOR LIKE THREE YEARS TO HELP THE CITY OF LA TO GET OVER OUR HARSH BUDGET IMPASSE. LUCKILY FOR US THAT FIFTY SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR HOLE THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BEGIN RIGHT NOW. NOT ONLY DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT WE'RE FLOURISHING RIGHT NOW. BOB AS MANY OF YOU FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NO THAT. THERE WAS A LOT STUFF DONE TO ME. AND SOME OF YOU THOUGHT MY OPPONENT WAS RUNNING AGAINST YOU YOU GOT SO MUCH MAIL. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S ABOUT SOMETIMES. TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE DO THE RIGHT THING AND WE SHOULD PRAISE ALL THE PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR TAKING THAT RISK TO SUSPEND SALARIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE HOLE. I DON'T THINK WE DID I DON'T THINK WE WERE GIVEN UP OUR SALARIES. I DON'T THINK WE ARE NOT TAKING BENEFITS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE STATE AND THE TAXPAYERS. AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD CONTINUE TO RUN. AND SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD. AND BOAT HI ON THIS. AND I HAVE ANOTHER REASON FOR DOING THIS. MENTAL HEALTH FOR ME IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THERE'S SOME THINGS IN THIS CONTRACT THEY HELP INDIVIDUALS S. C. C. P. AWAY DEAL WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. WHICH HAS PRODUCED A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE NCDC ARE. WEATHER'S DAYS OFF. OR WHETHER IT'S BEING ABLE TO HAVE MORE DAYS TO DEAL WITH THE PANDEMIC MENTALLY. I HAD A BILL ON THIS FLOOR. ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH FOR PRISON GUARD TO CCPOA DID MAKE IT THROUGH. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BRING IT BACK NEXT YEAR I NEED TO HAVE EVERYBODY ON BOARD BECAUSE. LAST FRIDAY. MANY OF YOU KNOW STEPHAN WALKER. AND HIS SON WHO'S A PRO OFTEN CDC ARE COMMITTED SUICIDE. INSTEAD FOR WALKERS A FRIEND. OF EVERYBODY ON THIS FOR SEVERAL WATER IS THE ONE THAT GAVE ME THAT IDEA. IT WAS THE WISDOM OF OUR I'VE MISSED OUT MY FRIEND FROM FROM A L. DROVE THAT PUT IN THERE THAT HAVE TO BE PART OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING I WISH WE COULD PUT THIS IN THIS BUDGET RIGHT NOW. TO DO IT. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. WE NEED TO USE THIS THESE CONTRACT. TO HELP THEM MOVE TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND TO HELP THEM HELP THEMSELVES AND AS I DO BRING THIS BACK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO AN URGENCY CLAUSE WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE CAN. ON THE- BUDGET. AND IN STATUTE. SO THAT WE CAN MOVE THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL I'VE GOT ASSURANCES FROM CCPOA MANAGEMENT THAT THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO I AM GOING UP TODAY. BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STAY VIGILANT WHAT'S CCPOA SO WE CAN HELP THEM HELP THEMSELVES. ARE PROBABLY ONE OF THE TOUGHEST BEAT YOU CAN WALK IN CALIFORNIA. OTHERWISE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE MORE PEOPLE COMMITTING SUICIDE AND CCPOA IN CORRECTIONS FACILITIES. BEN BEING HURT OR KILLED BY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCARCERATED. AND SO THERE'S A THERE'S A CRISIS THERE. SO FOR NOW LET'S GO AHEAD AND REALLY LOOK AT HONORING THE COMMITMENT WE MADE. DURING A TOUGH TIME TO THEM. BUT YOU KNOW I WILL TELL YOU GOD ONLY GIVES PEOPLE TO CHEEKS. AND YES I'M A TURN TO CHEAT ON THIS ONE. I ONLY HAVE ONE OTHER CHEEK. AND I THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND. THAT YOU ONLY GET A COUPLE SHIFTS YOU ONLY GET ONE CHANCE TO DO MAKE A MISTAKE NOW'S THE TIME TO MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE CCPOA BETTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS JONES SAWYER MISTER KALRA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE LOS ANGELES- AND I AGREE WITH WHAT WITH MUCH OF WHAT HE SAID- PARTICULARLY. THE LAST PORTION REGARDING- THE TRAUMA. IN THE ENVIRONMENTS BURKE OF CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES THERE'S TRAUMA FOR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS THERE'S TRAUMA FOR THOSE THAT ARE INCARCERATED- AND FOR ALL THE OTHERS THAT WORK IN THOSE FACILITIES AND SO I WOULD HOPE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO REDUCE THE TRAUMA ACROSS THE BOARD FOR EVERYONE THAT'S INVOLVED OUR SYSTEM INCLUDING OUR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND I AGREE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD'VE. DONE A LONG TIME AGO- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW LOOK I BELIEVE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING- AND I BELIEVE- IN PUBLIC WORK IT AND THE WORK OF THOSE UP WITH THAT ARE IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR PUBLIC SERVICE. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES ARE A LOT OF BARGAINING UNITS THAT HELP TO RUN THOSE FACILITIES AND SO WHAT IF THIS PARTICULAR MEASURES APPROVED. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE THINK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THAT WORK NOT JUST IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES BUT IN ALL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE THEY'VE ALL SACRIFICED- OVER THE PAST YEAR PLUS EVERYONE TO SACRIFICE NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF MONETARILY BUT IN TERMS OF THE MOTIONAL PHYSICAL MEDICAL TRAUMA THAT. EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN REQUIRED TO GO TO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY HAS GONE THROUGH AND I THINK THAT DOES THAT TO CHOOSE PUBLIC WORK AND PUBLIC SERVICE DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY- TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR SACRIFICES AND SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE BY ALSO WOULD URGE ALL OF US TO NOT FORGET- THE DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BARGAINING UNITS ACROSS- WIDE RANGES OF. OUR PUBLIC SECTOR SYSTEM. ACTIONS UNIVERSE CAL. HEALTH AND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE BOARD- MANY OF WHICH WE'VE SACRIFICED AND WORKED. THROUGH OF THE PANDEMIC. OF THAT WE THINK ABOUT THEM AS WELL WHEN THEY COME FORWARD. AND ASK. FOR THEIR NOT JUST- COMPENSATION FOR WHAT THEY SACRIFICE WHAT THEY GAVE UP TO KEEP THE STATE AFLOAT- BUT RECOGNITION FOR THEIR CONTINUED SERVICE IN THE YEARS AHEAD THANK YOU. AVERAGE CAR MISTER FLORES. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS AND I LINE MY COMMENTS WITH THE MEMBER FROM LA.

HOW CAN WE AS AN INSTITUTION EXPECT THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY TO PROTECT US IF THEY ARE NOT MENTALLY SOUND. HOW CAN WE EXPECT THEM TO DO THEIR JOBS IN AND DO THEIR JOBS PROPERLY. SO I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUT THIS IS NOT DONE YET. WE DO A LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA WE'RE DOING A LOT ON THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. NOW WE NEED TO FOCUS ON MEN AND WOMEN TO PROTECT US AND THEIR MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE OF THEIR NOT SOUND. AND WE CAN EXPECT TO PROTECT US IN THE WAY THAT WE KNOW THEY WANT TO STOP BY- TONIGHT VOTE.

I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. I THINK I MISSED FONG MR LACKEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THERE CLEARLY ARE SOME SUPPORTABLE MEASURES IN THIS PARTICULAR CONSIDERATION BUT LET ME SPEAK TO THE POISON PILL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MORE SYKORA. THE DOMINANCE OF THE ILLICIT MARKET IS FAR MORE DAMAGING TO OUR ENVIRONMENT THAN ANY SINGLE REGULATION COULD ACCOMPLISH AND SUPPORTING OUR ENVIRONMENT. THE ILLICIT MARKET RIGHT NOW THE GIRLS ARE BLANKETING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DESERT WHERE I LIVE. OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED. OF THESE ALYSSA GROVES ARE POISONING OUR LAND AND LITERALLY STEALING PRECIOUS WATER. FROM OUR DESERT. WARM MORE REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THE LEGAL GROWERS WRONGLY STRENGTHEN THE EXTREME ADVANTAGE A DOMINANCE OF ILLICIT MARKET SO I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS. FAMOUS LACKEY DR QUIRK YOUR RECOGNIZE YES I RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNS THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM PALMDALE HAS HOWEVER THE- IT CHAIR CHIANG AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAVE SAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO OUR RE LOOK AT THE SEQUOIA- REGULATIONS SO THAT IT WILL NOT BE THE LARGE BURDEN UPON THE LEGAL GROWERS AND I THANK THE COMMITTEE VERY MUCH FOR DOING THAT.

THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND AND THE INTERMEDIATE CRITICAL NEED TO COUNT IT ALSO MAKES CHANGES TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DESIGN BUILD PROCUREMENT PROCESS AS WELL AS TO CREATE THE COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE OPERATIONS INSTRUCTOR ALL OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON AB ONE FOUR THREE. THANK MISTING MR FONG. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AVOIDING ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS THE BEDROCK OF OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND ARE COUNTY COURTS PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS THE MOST IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO OUR LEGAL SYSTEM SO WITH A BACKLOG OF COURT CONSTRUCTION I'M HOPEFUL THE DESIGN BUILD IMPLEMENTATION WILL STREAMLINED IMPORTANT COURT CONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER I SEE THIS BILL COMPOUNDING GET ANOTHER BROKEN SYSTEM BOTH THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND AND THE IMMEDIATE AND CRITICAL NEED TO COUNT ARE ON THE VERGE OF INSOLVENCY THE SOLUTION THOUGH IS NOT TO MERGE THEM BUT TO HELP THEM RE GROW AND BUILD BACK THEIR FUNDING BRICK BY BRICK THESE FUNDS CANNOT SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND WE ARE MERELY KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. COUNTIES HAVE ALSO SUFFERED A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE AFTER THE LEGISLATURE ABOLISHED DOZENS OF FINES AND FEES COUNTY'S RELIED ON IN THIS BILL IMPOSES A NEW FORMULA THAT LIKELY WILL LEAD TO COUNTIES LOSING RESOURCES AND BEING DENIED BACK BUT REVENUES THE ADMINISTRATION GUARANTEED.
