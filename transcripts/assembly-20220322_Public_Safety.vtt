KEITH WIDELY- THE EXECUTIVE

MAKE A FAIR DISCRETIONARY PAROLE

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:22.738
PROCESS THAT'S THE WORK WE DO- I

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:26.542
HAVE- BEEN STUDYING THIS PROCESS

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.778
FOR TWENTY YEARS- AND APPEARED

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:29.945
IN HUNDREDS OF PAROLE HEARINGS

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:32.348
ALSO TEACH CLASSES BERKELEY LAW.

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:33.549
CALIFORNIA PRISONS AND

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.085
DISCRETIONARY PAROLE SO I I'M

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:38.421
VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROCESS-

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:40.723
AB EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX CONTINUES

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:43.092
A TREND THAT DELIVERS NO JUSTICE

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:44.560
AND PROVIDES NO RELIEF CRIME

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:47.363
SURVIVORS. MORE THAN FORTY FIVE

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.198
YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA SEVERELY

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.533
LIMITED THE PAROLE BOARD'S ROLE

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:51.767
BECAUSE IT'S DECISIONS WERE TOO

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:54.837
OFTEN BASED ON BIASED. EMOTION

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.039
AND GUT FEELINGS SINCE THEN

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.741
WE'VE PASSED LAWS REQUIRING

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.609
SPECIAL PAROLE HEARINGS FOR

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.077
YOUTH AND ELDERLY AND FOR CRIMES

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:04.013
CAUSED IN PART BY DOMESTIC

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.381
VIOLENCE. TO COUNTER THAT WE'VE

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:06.615
ALSO SEEN AN EXPANSION OF THE

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:08.884
ROLE OF VICTIMS IN THE PROCESS.

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:10.286
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE PRESENCE

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:11.954
OF A VICTIM IN A PAROLE HEARING

01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:13.689
IS A STRONGER PREDICTOR OF THE

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.257
HEARING'S OUTCOME THAN MOST

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:17.993
OTHER FACTORS. YOUTH ELDERLY THE

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.395
ORIGINAL CRIME THE LENGTH OF

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:23.332
INCARCERATION OR THE AMOUNT OF

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.500
PROGRAM THE PERSON'S DONE. THIS

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:27.002
IS A PROBLEM FOR SEVERAL REASONS

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:29.004
FIRST- SURVIVORS HAVE NO UNIQUE

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:30.473
INFORMATION ABOUT OF PAROLE

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:33.809
APPLICANTS CURRENT. RISK TO

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.277
PUBLIC SAFETY. THE ROLE IN

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:37.313
RECOUNTING THE IMPACT OF THE

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:38.914
CRIME STIRS UP EMOTIONS OF

01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:40.483
PAROLE COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:41.717
DECISIONS ARE THEREFORE BASED ON

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:44.854
BIAS EMOTION AND GUT FEELINGS.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.755
JUST AS THEY WERE FORTY FIVE

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:48.591
YEARS AGO SECOND THE PROCESS RE

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:50.893
TRAUMATIZE. COMMISSIONERS

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.028
DISCUSSED IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.697
THE WORST THING THAT EVER

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:57.366
HAPPENED TO SURVIVORS WHILE

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.601
PROVIDING NO OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:08:58.667 --> 01:08:59.835
HEALING. YET OF GROWING BODY OF

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:01.370
RESEARCH SHOWING THAT A MAJORITY

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.538
OF SURVIVORS OF VIOLENT CRIME

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:04.540
CHOOSE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WHEN

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:06.675
GIVEN AN OPTION. WE JUST DON'T

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:08.577
GIVE THEM AN OPTION- IF

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:09.545
CALIFORNIA REALLY CARED ABOUT

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:10.713
SERVING SURVIVORS WE WOULD

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.014
INVEST IN THAT KIND OF HEALING

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:15.084
PROCESS. AND NOT ADD TO THIS

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:16.585
HARMFUL HEARING PROCESS. THIRD

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.354
AND FINALLY THIS BILL ALLOCATES

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.523
DISPROPORTIONATE RESOURCES I

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.591
HAVE AN EXAMPLE RECENT EXAMPLE I

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.760
JUST HAD A HEARING. WITH EIGHT

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.296
SURVIVORS PRESENT IN THE HEARING

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.765
. UNDER THIS BILL EACH OF THEM

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.934
WOULD QUALIFY FOR AN ATTORNEY.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:35.070

THAT ONE HEARING AND THAT'S

01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:41.010
COMPARED TO JUST NINE HUNDRED

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:42.678
DOLLARS- FOR THE WANT ATTORNEY

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:43.646

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:50.586
UNCONSCIONABLE THIS. THIS

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:52.054

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:52.888

WE'RE SORRY BUT REGRETFULLY MUST

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:28.490
STILL OPPOSE- AND I WOULD JUST

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:31.293
ECHO OF THE COMMENTS THAT MR

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.397

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:38.667
BASICALLY. EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX.

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:40.769
IN A VERDANT LEE SEEKS TO

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:43.205
SUBVERT THE RULE OF LAW AND

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:44.707
REPLACE THE FACTORY EVAN PAROLE

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:47.343
PROCESS WITH AN EMOTIONALLY

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:52.081
DRIVEN PROCESS. WHERE THE FAMILY

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:54.617
. BECAUSE OF THAT EMOTION SEEK

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:57.486
TO EXERT UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE

INDIVIDUAL. AND ALSO I WANT TO

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:11.600
SAY THAT PAYING FOR AND VICTIMS

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.569
LAWYERS WOULD MERELY CREATE A

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.337
BONANZA FOR POTENTIALLY

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:27.249
GUARANTEE THAN AN INDIVIDUAL BE

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:31.353
PAROLED. AND OF COURSE. THIS IS

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.355
A PROMISE THAT NO ETHICAL LAWYER

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:35.391
COULD MAKE SENSE THE BOARD'S

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:37.660

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:40.896
GOVERNED BY THE LAW ON THE FAX.

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.398
ALL THE WHILE THE TAXPAYERS WILL

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:45.968
BE STUCK WITH PAYING THE TAB.

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:48.771
WASTING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.639
BETTER SPENT ON EDUCATION MENTAL

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:54.009
HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING. THESE

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:56.712
ARE PUBLIC GOODS THAT WOULD MAKE

MISTER CORK. SAU MARSH MARSHES

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:27.196

LONG AS WE HAVE THAT INITIATIVE

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.701
- I THINK IT'S ONLY RIGHT THAT.

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:35.838
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT USED TO.

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:37.739

RIGHT THAT THEY HAVE.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:50.552
REPRESENTATION I THINK YOUR

ARGUMENTS BY AND LARGE ARE

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:55.023

WHICH CASE YOU REALLY SHOULD.

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:58.660
THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THAT IS

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:01.230
TO HAVE ANOTHER INITIATIVE. SO

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:07.169

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:12.040
THIS ONE I THAT THAT WE NEED TO

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:12.875
MAKE SURE THAT OUR VICTIMS ARE

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:15.143

GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED.

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:22.184
I DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:24.753
NOTICE. OR THE LACK OF NOTICING

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:28.190
AND IMPACT THAT THAT WILL HAVE

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:30.559
ON THE PEARLY. AND IN IN THEIR

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.694
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SEEK

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:35.397

SUPPORTING YOUR- YOUR BILL

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:57.819
TODAY- AS YOU KNOW A DE. I GOTTA

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:58.987
TELL YOU THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:01.390
BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:03.592
EDUCATIONAL WORLD AND WHAT WE

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:06.128
WISH WOULD HAPPEN. BUT I HAD A

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:12.367
CHANCE- THIS YEAR TO WITNESS. I

01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:14.736
WHAT IF FEEL LIKE TWENTY THIRTY

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:18.607
YEARS LATER. WHEN THE A PERSON-

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:21.977
THAT- IS A NEIGHBOR OF MINE. WHO

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:26.848
ARE SUFFERED A HORRIFIC. ASSAULT

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.951
AFTER WATCHING HER DAD GET SHOT

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:30.552
IN THE FACE SHE GOT SHOT IN THE

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:33.588
CHEST SHE MANAGED TO SURVIVE.

01:16:33.655 --> 01:16:37.192
HER HER PERPETRATOR CAME UP FOR

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:39.494
A PAROLE HEARING. AND THEY FOUND

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:42.064
OUT ABOUT THE LAST MINUTE. AND

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.598
THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT THEY

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:46.935
WERE GOING TO LET THIS GUY GO

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:50.238
AND BACK INTO SOCIETY. AND THE

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:53.942
FEAR IN THAT COUPLE. THAT THEIR

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:55.811
LIVES ARE GOING TO BE IN DANGER

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.012
THEIR KIDS LIVES ARE GOING TO BE

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.081
IN DANGER ISRAEL IT'S NOT

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:01.616
IMAGINED IT'S EDIBLE LASTING

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.685
EFFECT OF HAVING A HORRIFIC

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:07.956
CRIME PERPETRATED ON SOMEBODY.

01:17:08.023 --> 01:17:11.426
AND SO THIS BILL HELPS THOSE

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:14.262
PEOPLE. HAVE A VOICE BECAUSE

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:16.198
THEY NEED TO HAVE A VOICE THIRTY

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:18.834
YEARS LATER FORTY YEARS LATER.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.403
IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT HAPPENED

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.804
IN THAT IT HAPPENED THIRTY YEARS

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:24.539
LATER AND THIS PERSON HAS A

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:27.342
MIRACULOUSLY CHANGED. I HOPE

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.844
THEY CAN I HOPE THEY HAVE. I

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.612
HOPE THEY'VE FOUND WHATEVER IT

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:32.080
IS THAT MADE THEM THAT PERSON

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.249
WAY BACK THEN TO MAKE THEM A

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:36.651
BETTER PERSON BUT THAT DOES NOT

01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:39.221
ALLEVIATE THE FEAR. THAT THESE

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:40.522
HAVE THESE. AND THEY HAVE TO

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.491
HAVE A WAY TO VOICE THEIR FEARS

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:43.725
EVEN IF IT MAKES THAT WHAT YOU

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:46.061
THINK THE PAROLE HEARING WHAT

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:49.197
MAKES IT A BIASED HEARING. THEY

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:50.632
THEY NEED TO HAVE A PLACE IN

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:52.100
THAT HEARING. IT'S NOT THEIR

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.503
FAULT THAT THEY ARE THERE. IT'S

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.904
THEIR FAULT THE MAYBE THEY

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:58.807
SURVIVED AND CAN BE THERE. AND

01:17:58.874 --> 01:17:59.975
SO I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:01.977
THIS BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:04.913
MAKES SENSE FOR VICTIMS. AND

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.014
WHILE I'M ALL FOR PEOPLE BEING

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:07.983
REHABILITATED. THERE IS A

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:10.419
LASTING EFFECT ON SOME ACTIONS

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:12.954
THAT PEOPLE TAKING THEIR LIVES.

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:15.991
AND TO SIMPLY DISMISS THAT THE

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.093
VICTIMS CONCERNS IN FAVOR OF

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:23.098
THAT AT TO ME IS WRONG. YES MR

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:25.634
LACKEY. YEAH FIRST OF ALL LET ME

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.303
JUST A CORRECT ONE OF THE-

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.639
INFERENCES- THERE WOULD BE

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:32.641
MULTIPLE NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:33.442
REIMBURSEMENTS FOR MULTIPLE

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:37.045
CHARGES- SO QUESTION TO THE

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:38.013
AUTHORS OUT I. ON THAT IS

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.414
ACTUALLY NOT ACCURATE THIS IS

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:41.349
ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A LAST

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:44.286
DITCH EFFORT TO- REIMBURSE. WHO

01:18:44.352 --> 01:18:46.088
HAVE PAID ALREADY PAID FOR

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:47.956
PRIVATE ATTORNEY- AND THE

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:48.690
ULTIMATE REASON IS BECAUSE THE

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:50.625
DA IS NOT SENDING REPRESENTATION

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:52.794
AT THE DA'S SEND REPRESENTING.

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:55.263
THEN THIS WOULD NOT GOING TO

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:56.565
AFFECT. AND THE WORD IT'S MY

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:58.400
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MAN NINE

01:18:58.467 --> 01:18:59.501
HUNDRED DOLLAR REIMBURSES WOULD

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.570
ONLY. TAKE PLACE IF THERE'S

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:03.138
MULTIPLE VICTIMS. AND NOT

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.673
MULTIPLE CHARGES THAT CORRECT

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:07.109
CORRECT. OKAY AND THE OTHER

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:10.312
PIECE AS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT.

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:13.515
I'M I WAS A GAS WHEN I HEARD

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:18.253
THAT- IT'S BELIEVE THAT- VICTIMS

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.289
PRESENT IN FOR- JUST EMOTION TO

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:24.192
THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. EMOTIONS

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:26.328
ARE NOT ALWAYS MISLEADING- AND I

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:28.563
THINK THAT WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:31.900
FOCUS ON REHABILITATING. THAT WE

PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM STEALING

02:04:56.889 --> 02:04:59.525
WHEN YOU. AT SAN FRANCISCO THERE

REAL REPUTATION. RIGHT THAT'S

02:05:30.923 --> 02:05:32.725

REGION OF THE STATE THIS IS A

02:05:41.634 --> 02:05:43.202
PROBLEM. WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

02:05:43.269 --> 02:05:45.371
AB SIXTY NO THREE IS JUST HAVE A

02:05:45.437 --> 02:05:47.039
VERY. TARGETED APPROACH A VERY

02:05:47.106 --> 02:05:48.841
MEASURED APPROACH TO SAY LOOK WE

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:50.776
NOT ONLY RECOGNISE THIS PROBLEM.

02:05:50.843 --> 02:05:52.478
BUT WE WANT TO HELP ADDRESS IT

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:53.545
WHEN I'M TALKING TO LAW

02:05:53.612 --> 02:05:54.813
ENFORCEMENT LOCALLY WHEN I'M

02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:56.215
TALKING TO THE BUSINESS UNDER.

02:05:56.282 --> 02:05:58.150
WHEN I'M TALKING TO CUSTOMERS.

02:05:58.217 --> 02:06:01.587
THEY SAY LOOK. IN THE THRESHOLD

02:06:01.654 --> 02:06:02.888
WAS LOWER AT FOUR HUNDRED

02:06:02.955 --> 02:06:04.256
DOLLARS WE DIDN'T SEE THE

02:06:04.323 --> 02:06:05.891
PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE NOW. NOW I

02:06:05.958 --> 02:06:08.861
KNOW THAT THERE'S- DEBATE ON.

02:06:08.928 --> 02:06:10.362
WHETHER THIS WILL ACTUALLY MAKE

02:06:10.429 --> 02:06:11.764
A DIFFERENCE AND WHETHER OTHER

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:13.232
STATES HAVE HIGHER LIMITS IT'S

02:06:13.299 --> 02:06:14.633
FINE BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IF

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:16.769
YOU JUST TALK TO THE LOCALS. IF

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:18.237
YOU JUST TALK TO OUR BUSINESS

02:06:18.304 --> 02:06:20.005
OWNERS THEY WILL TELL YOU. SINCE

02:06:20.072 --> 02:06:21.407
THIS CHANGE THIS IS WHAT WE'VE

02:06:21.473 --> 02:06:23.509
SEEN IF WE COULD GO BACK AND SAY

02:06:23.575 --> 02:06:25.477
LOOK. LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT IT

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:26.745
WAS PRIOR AND HOPEFULLY THAT

02:06:26.812 --> 02:06:28.480
HELPS ALLEVIATE THE SITUATION AT

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:31.050
THE END OF THE DAY I WANT TO

02:06:31.116 --> 02:06:31.583
JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:32.818
PROTECTING CONSUMERS. THAT WE'RE

02:06:32.885 --> 02:06:33.552
PROTECTING OUR STORE CLERKS SO

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:35.621
THAT WHAT HAPPENED DOWN IN RITE

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:36.755
AID DOESN'T HAPPEN TO OTHERS-

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:38.657
WINDY YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF

02:06:38.724 --> 02:06:39.992
AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS THAT ARE

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:42.261
HAPPENING TO OUR EMPLOYEES. AT

02:06:42.328 --> 02:06:44.063
OUR STORES WE WANT TO TRY TO

02:06:44.129 --> 02:06:45.331
HELP ALLEVIATE THAT I BELIEVE

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:46.665
THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT.

02:06:46.732 --> 02:06:48.834
RIGHT DIRECTION I JUST

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:49.668
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

02:06:49.735 --> 02:06:51.370
VOTE. THANK YOU AND- IT IS A

02:06:51.437 --> 02:06:52.805
PROBLEM IN THE GOVERNOR DID

02:06:52.871 --> 02:06:54.840
RECOGNIZE IT I WISH YOU HAD BEEN

02:06:54.907 --> 02:06:55.641
. OR AT LEAST YOU HAD

02:06:55.708 --> 02:06:57.443
OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO THE-

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:58.744
PUBLIC SAFETY HERE WHEN WE

02:06:58.811 --> 02:07:00.646
TALKED ABOUT THE- THE

02:07:00.713 --> 02:07:02.481
GOVERNOR'S. BASIC QUARTER

02:07:02.548 --> 02:07:04.016
BILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT IN

02:07:04.083 --> 02:07:07.219
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- WHICH

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:09.722
OBVIOUSLY I WAS VERY EXCITED

02:07:09.788 --> 02:07:11.623
ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS BY BILL.

02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:12.958
ORGANIZED RETAIL FOR THAT THEN

02:07:13.025 --> 02:07:14.827
I'M THE ONE THAT EXTENDED THE

02:07:14.893 --> 02:07:17.463
LEAD TO SUNSET. AND ALSO TOOK

02:07:17.529 --> 02:07:19.465
OUT SOME PROVISIONS I THOUGHT

02:07:19.531 --> 02:07:22.534
WAS HARMFUL- I THINK NOW

02:07:22.601 --> 02:07:24.737
HOPEFULLY WE GET IN OUR OFFER

02:07:24.803 --> 02:07:26.438
YOU THE SAME IF THIS BILL DOES

02:07:26.505 --> 02:07:28.941
NOT MAKE IT OUT HERE. THAT WE

02:07:29.008 --> 02:07:30.242
ALL COME TOGETHER IN A

02:07:30.309 --> 02:07:32.478
COLLABORATIVE POLICING STRATEGY-

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:34.747
RIGHT NOW IS COMPROMISED AS WITH

02:07:34.813 --> 02:07:37.116
ME BASED POLLUTION IF AND WE'RE

02:07:37.182 --> 02:07:39.118
REALLY NOT GETTING TO- A

02:07:39.184 --> 02:07:41.420
COMPREHENSIVE PROPER CONSERVE

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:43.188
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. WE'RE

02:07:43.255 --> 02:07:46.558
ALL GOING TO SIDE ARGUED ABOUT

02:07:46.625 --> 02:07:49.495
WHICH ONE IS BETTER. AND SO I

02:07:49.561 --> 02:07:52.131
WILL GIVE YOU TO DO THE SAME

02:07:52.197 --> 02:07:53.432
OPPORTUNITY THE GOVERNOR HAS

02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:55.501
GIVEN US RESOURCES IMPROBABLE

02:07:55.567 --> 02:07:58.037
GIVE US MORE. EVEN WHEN SOMEONE

02:07:58.103 --> 02:08:00.773
MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:02.307
BATMAN OR WHILE WE WAIT FOR

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:04.043
BATMAN TO COME IN ABOUT BATMAN

02:08:04.109 --> 02:08:06.011
IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT IS

02:08:06.078 --> 02:08:08.380
THE IS THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY

02:08:08.447 --> 02:08:11.150
PATROL WE DO HAVE A BATMAN. WHEN

02:08:11.216 --> 02:08:14.653
OTHERS DO NOT DO THEIR JOB AND

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:16.855
EXACERBATE THE SITUATION BECAUSE

02:08:16.922 --> 02:08:18.390
THEY DON'T LIKE THE LAWS THAT

02:08:18.457 --> 02:08:21.093
ARE IN PLACE BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.127
SUPPOSED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:08:22.194 --> 02:08:23.929
WHERE LAWMAKERS WE MADE THE LAW

02:08:23.996 --> 02:08:24.930
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE IT

02:08:24.997 --> 02:08:28.667
IS NOT BEING. ENFORCED IN A WAY

02:08:28.734 --> 02:08:31.036
THAT WILL REDUCE CRIME AND WE'RE

02:08:31.103 --> 02:08:32.371
NOT DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO

02:08:32.438 --> 02:08:34.373
UNDER REHABILITATION SIDE TO

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:35.941
ENSURE THAT WHEN. WHEN LAW

02:08:36.008 --> 02:08:37.042
ENFORCEMENT CAPTURE THESE

02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:38.744
INDIVIDUALS THEY'RE ABLE TO

02:08:38.811 --> 02:08:40.579
FUNNEL THEM INTO RICE RESOURCES

02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:42.881
SO THEY DON'T PERCENT OF A- SO

02:08:42.948 --> 02:08:44.883
IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE. OF

02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:46.351
COLLABORATIVE WHEN I SEE

02:08:46.418 --> 02:08:47.920
COLLABORATIVE IS NOT COMP IT'S

02:08:47.986 --> 02:08:50.823
NOT IT'S A PARTNERSHIP MR. IT'S

02:08:50.889 --> 02:08:52.958
A COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH

02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:55.094
POLICE AND COMMUNITY NOT. TRYING

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:57.129
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WILL TAKE

02:08:57.196 --> 02:08:58.897
WHAT THE OTHER SIDE WOULD TAKE

02:08:58.964 --> 02:09:00.933
AND SO ON. IF THIS BILL DOESN'T

02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:02.634
GET OUT WE STILL NEED TO HAVE

02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:05.170
FOR A DISCUSSION. ON HOW WE CAN

02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:07.706
ACTUALLY FOCUS LIKE A LASER ON

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:08.807
HOW WE CAN IN ORGANIZED RETAIL

02:09:08.874 --> 02:09:11.443
THEFT. UP OTHERWISE AS I SAID

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:12.611
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER

02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:14.680
COMMITTEES ON THE OTHER PEOPLE

02:09:14.746 --> 02:09:15.614
THAT WILL GET TO THE ADVANTAGE

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:17.583
OF THE CRIMINALS. THAT'S WHAT WE

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:19.251
ARE DOING WE'RE ALLOWING THEM TO

02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:20.619
CRIMINALS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:09:20.686 --> 02:09:25.190
OUR DYSFUNCTION. AND WE NEED TO

02:09:25.257 --> 02:09:26.024
STOP THIS DESTRUCTION. WORK

02:09:26.091 --> 02:09:27.626
TOGETHER. AND WITH THAT FOR THE

02:09:27.693 --> 02:09:31.697
REASONS IT WOULD STATED ABOUT-

02:09:31.763 --> 02:09:33.298
YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE CONCERNED

02:09:33.365 --> 02:09:35.000
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

02:09:35.067 --> 02:09:36.568
LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL GO AFTER TO

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:38.570
FILL THE PRISONS. THAT IS NOT A

02:09:38.637 --> 02:09:40.772
SOLUTION THAT IS WHAT LOWERING

02:09:40.839 --> 02:09:42.574
THE THRESHER WILL ULTIMATELY DO

02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:44.510
IS JUST FILLED THE PRISONS AGAIN

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:45.711
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN TO THREE

02:09:45.777 --> 02:09:47.546
STRAIGHT VERY DONE IT BEFORE.

02:09:47.613 --> 02:09:50.149
AND IT DIDN'T WORK TO BE A GAY

02:09:50.215 --> 02:09:52.684
PEOPLE OF WHO ARE FEARFUL OF

02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:55.154
CRIME GAVE HIM A WARM FEELING

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:56.221
THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE

02:09:56.288 --> 02:09:57.756
INCARCERATED IN A PRISON

02:09:57.823 --> 02:10:00.926
PLANTATION SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE.

02:10:00.993 --> 02:10:02.794

COMMUNITIES LIKE YOU WOULDN'T

02:10:04.329 --> 02:10:05.397
BELIEVE. AND SO WITH THAT

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:07.032
UNFORTUNATELY I'M A RECOMMENDED

02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:09.401

DEBT TO SOCIETY A FAIR SHOT TO

02:13:45.283 --> 02:13:49.287
REBUILD THEIR LIVES. BUT IT IS

02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:52.057

PROBLEM WITH THAT HOWEVER- THIS

04:03:50.916 --> 04:03:54.853
EFFORT TO- REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

NOTICE IT'S DUPLICATIVE BECAUSE-

04:04:00.459 --> 04:04:02.461
THE BILL IS ASSIGNING THE DA

04:04:02.527 --> 04:04:03.662
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE ALREADY

04:04:03.729 --> 04:04:05.063
HELD BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

THESE NOTICES- THEY PROVIDE THEM

04:04:17.342 --> 04:04:19.277
AT LEAST NINETY DAYS BEFORE THE

04:04:19.344 --> 04:04:21.646

TO DO IS REGISTER- WITH THE

04:04:25.150 --> 04:04:25.484
BOARD TO GET THOSE

04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:28.186

TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO DO

04:04:36.695 --> 04:04:39.297
THIS VERY THING. TO PROVIDE

04:04:39.364 --> 04:04:42.901
ADDITIONAL NOTICE- TWO SURVIVORS

04:04:42.968 --> 04:04:45.570
OF THE CRIMES OF THAT THE PROBE

04:04:45.637 --> 04:04:47.873
WAS BEING CONSIDERED- THE OTHER

04:04:47.939 --> 04:04:54.079
POINT I MAKE IS THAT. TWENTY

04:04:54.146 --> 04:04:56.014
FOUR NINE- I JUST DON'T THINK IT

04:04:56.081 --> 04:04:57.883
RELEASED SUPPORT SURVIVORS-

04:04:57.949 --> 04:05:00.352
BECAUSE AS WE INDICATED REQUIRES

04:05:00.419 --> 04:05:03.822
THE A TO- REACH OUT TO ALL

04:05:03.889 --> 04:05:05.991
SURVIVORS EVEN IF THEY'VE CHOSEN

04:05:06.058 --> 04:05:07.893
TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO FURTHER

04:05:07.959 --> 04:05:10.095
WITH THIS PROCESS NOTHING TO DO

04:05:10.162 --> 04:05:12.531
WITH THE PERSON WHO CAUSED THEM

04:05:12.597 --> 04:05:13.732
HARM OR THE CRIME BECAUSE THE

04:05:13.799 --> 04:05:17.335
MARK- AND IN FACT MOST CRIME

04:05:17.402 --> 04:05:19.337
SURVIVORS CHOOSE NOT TO

04:05:19.404 --> 04:05:22.741
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS- I

04:05:22.808 --> 04:05:25.010
THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF CONCERNS

04:05:25.077 --> 04:05:26.778
ABOUT TRIGGERING THE PAST HARMS

04:05:26.845 --> 04:05:30.949
BASS DRUM- AND IT'S A PROCESS

04:05:31.016 --> 04:05:32.017
THAT PROVIDES NO ACCESS TO

04:05:32.084 --> 04:05:37.122
HEALING. I THINK THIS CHOICE HAS

04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:39.324
TO BE RESPECTED- WHAT THIS BILL

04:05:39.391 --> 04:05:41.326
WOULD DO IS IT WOULD FORCE THEM

04:05:41.393 --> 04:05:43.061
TO BE A PART OF A HARMFUL

04:05:43.128 --> 04:05:46.998
PROCESS SOLELY AT THE WHIM. OF

04:05:47.065 --> 04:05:49.201
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CAPITALIZE

04:05:49.267 --> 04:05:50.735
OFF THEIR RAW EMOTION. TO

04:05:50.802 --> 04:05:52.404
DISTRACT PAROLE COMMISSIONERS

04:05:52.471 --> 04:05:55.107
FROM THERE NOT JUST THE PRIMARY

04:05:55.173 --> 04:05:57.342
THIS SOLE RESPONSIBILITY. AS THE

CONSIDER SOMEONE'S CURRENT RISK

04:05:59.077 --> 04:06:03.915

04:06:03.982 --> 04:06:05.217

I'M NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW

04:12:09.214 --> 04:12:11.583
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WOULD BE

04:12:11.649 --> 04:12:13.518
IN ANY BETTER POSITION THAN

04:12:13.585 --> 04:12:17.755
OVERLY THAN THAT- THE SRS TO-

04:12:17.822 --> 04:12:20.325

MISTER CORK- HUMBOLDT LITTLE

04:13:39.203 --> 04:13:46.244
BIT- CONCERNED THAT. WELL I

04:13:46.311 --> 04:13:48.246
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THAT IF

04:13:48.313 --> 04:13:49.981
YOU HAVEN'T OPTED IN SOME PEOPLE

04:13:50.048 --> 04:13:52.884
JUST. YOU KNOW MAY HAVE LOST

04:13:52.951 --> 04:13:56.754
THAT PIECE PER. TO- THAT PC PER

04:13:56.821 --> 04:14:00.758
. PAPERWORK BUT I THINK THERE IS

04:14:00.825 --> 04:14:01.726
A CONCERN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

04:14:01.793 --> 04:14:04.062
BE. REMINDING PEOPLE OF

04:14:04.128 --> 04:14:05.663
SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO BE

04:14:05.730 --> 04:14:06.764
REMINDED ABOUT I'M GOING TO

04:14:06.831 --> 04:14:08.733
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I

04:14:08.800 --> 04:14:10.702
REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

04:14:10.768 --> 04:14:13.004
AND I HAVE CONCERNS AND I THINK

04:14:13.071 --> 04:14:14.872
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO

04:14:14.939 --> 04:14:15.673
THINK ABOUT ALSO IT'S GOING TO

04:14:15.740 --> 04:14:19.444
GO TO APPROPRIATIONS WHICH- NOW

04:14:19.510 --> 04:14:20.979
ALL OF US HAVE BILLS TO DIE

04:14:21.045 --> 04:14:22.847
THERE EVERY YEAR. I THINK IT'S

04:14:22.914 --> 04:14:25.083
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO GET SOME

04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:28.553
SORT OF- ESTIMATE FROM THE D.

04:14:28.620 --> 04:14:30.521

SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS TO

04:14:32.523 --> 04:14:36.227
AFFORD IT. BECAUSE- IT'S

04:14:36.294 --> 04:14:38.496
SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT IT MAY BE

04:14:38.563 --> 04:14:39.831
SOMETHING THE STATE HAS TO

04:14:39.897 --> 04:14:41.766
REMEMBER SO I THINK YOU NEED TO.

04:14:41.833 --> 04:14:43.768

ESTIMATE FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR

04:14:47.405 --> 04:14:49.173
BILL. BUT THEN I'M I'M ALSO

04:14:49.240 --> 04:14:51.442
CONCERNED AGAIN ABOUT PEOPLE

04:14:51.509 --> 04:14:52.877
BEING REMINDED ABOUT SOMETHING

04:14:52.944 --> 04:14:54.879
THAT I WANT TO REMIND IT ABOUT

04:14:54.946 --> 04:14:56.714

THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL

04:15:06.591 --> 04:15:09.694
THAT- IS STEP HAS SUBPOENA POWER

04:15:09.761 --> 04:15:11.429
OVER SOMEBODY WHO GETS NOTIFIED

04:15:11.496 --> 04:15:13.865
THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE

04:15:13.931 --> 04:15:14.599
PAROLE HEARING SO THEY GET AND

04:15:14.666 --> 04:15:17.201
PIECE OF PAPER THEY DON'T WANT

04:15:17.268 --> 04:15:18.569
TO DO IT THEY WRINKLE IT UP TO

04:15:18.636 --> 04:15:20.104
THROW. THE TRASH. AND THEY'VE

04:15:20.171 --> 04:15:21.372
DEALT WITH IT. OKAY BECAUSE

04:15:21.439 --> 04:15:25.076
THAT'S I. I'M I UNDERSTAND.

04:15:30.415 --> 04:15:31.916
ARGUMENTS SOUND LIKE YOU KNOW

04:15:31.983 --> 04:15:33.718
PEOPLE ARE COMPELLED TO GO TO

04:15:33.785 --> 04:15:34.719
THIS AND IT'S GOING TO DREDGE UP

04:15:34.786 --> 04:15:35.887
MEMORIES- PEOPLE THAT HAVE

04:15:35.953 --> 04:15:37.789
LEARNED TO COMPARTMENTALIZE AND

04:15:37.855 --> 04:15:39.924
DEAL WITH THESE THINGS- WILL

04:15:39.991 --> 04:15:42.226
WILL IF THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE

04:15:42.293 --> 04:15:44.028
DONE AND THEY DON'T CARE TO BE

04:15:44.095 --> 04:15:45.630
NOTIFIED ARE THEY DON'T CARE TO

04:15:45.697 --> 04:15:46.831
PARTICIPATE- THEY WILLSIMPLY

04:15:46.898 --> 04:15:48.966
JUST THROW IT AWAY AND NOT

04:15:49.033 --> 04:15:50.702
PARTICIPATE AND THAT TAKES CARE

04:15:50.768 --> 04:15:53.037

THE OTHER. JUST REAL QUICK GREAT

04:15:58.209 --> 04:16:00.978
YET IT SEEMS LIKE. TO ME THIS

04:16:01.045 --> 04:16:02.780
BILL IS BASICALLY SUPPORTED BY

04:16:02.847 --> 04:16:05.817
JUST DECENCY OF BEING ABLE TO-

04:16:05.883 --> 04:16:11.656
NOTIFY SOMEONE OF THIS LEVEL OF-

04:16:11.723 --> 04:16:15.560
AND OFFENDER I I'D- I TOOK

04:16:15.626 --> 04:16:16.394
UMBRAGE WITH THE FACT TO SAY

04:16:16.461 --> 04:16:18.996
THAT- VICTIMS WOULD ACTUALLY

04:16:19.063 --> 04:16:21.132
CAPITALIZE OFF OF THEIR SOUL OF

04:16:21.199 --> 04:16:25.536
MOTION. I MEAN THAT IS INSULTING

04:16:25.603 --> 04:16:27.772
TO ME. TO KNOW THAT- A LOT OF

04:16:27.839 --> 04:16:29.974
THESE OFFENSES ARE VERY HEINOUS

04:16:30.041 --> 04:16:36.614
AND- THE WAY THEY IMPACT VICTIMS

04:16:36.681 --> 04:16:37.682
- SHOULD NOT BE HELD AND

04:16:37.749 --> 04:16:40.118
JUDGMENT. I MEAN IT'S VERY VERY

04:16:40.184 --> 04:16:43.554
UNFORTUNATE FOR ALL INVOLVED

04:16:43.621 --> 04:16:45.590
THAT TO SOME PEOPLE TAKE THESE

04:16:45.656 --> 04:16:48.159
COURSES OF ACTION BUT IN THE

04:16:48.226 --> 04:16:51.195
INTEREST OF JUSTICE WE NEED TO

04:16:51.262 --> 04:16:53.464
RECOGNIZE BOTH THE OFFENDER. AND

04:16:53.531 --> 04:16:55.900
THE VICTIM AND THIS IS ALL THIS

04:16:55.967 --> 04:16:57.769
IS ASKING OF THE VICTIMS BE

04:16:57.835 --> 04:16:59.437
NOTIFIED. THAT THERE'S GOING TO

04:16:59.504 --> 04:17:01.539
BE DISCUSSION AYE I FIND IT HARD

04:17:01.606 --> 04:17:03.441
TO BELIEVE THERE'S OPPOSITION

04:17:03.508 --> 04:17:06.744
BUT I'M I'LL BE SUPPORTING. DO

04:17:06.811 --> 04:17:09.147

04:17:11.215 --> 04:17:12.650
REGARDS TO YEARS ONE OF THE

04:17:12.717 --> 04:17:14.318
THINGS WITH THE DA THEY HAVE

04:17:14.385 --> 04:17:16.454
ACCESS TO DMV RECORDS A LITTLE

04:17:16.521 --> 04:17:17.588
BIT MORE RECORDS THAT THEY CAN

04:17:17.655 --> 04:17:19.824
FIND IF THEY NEED TO FIND THE

04:17:19.891 --> 04:17:21.325
PERSON ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SPEND

04:17:21.392 --> 04:17:22.593

THAT APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE THAT

04:17:37.375 --> 04:17:38.709
SEEMS TO BE THE BIGGEST THING IS

04:17:38.776 --> 04:17:40.812
HAVING THEM HAVE TO DEAL WITH

04:17:40.878 --> 04:17:42.346

RESTRUCTURED SO IT'S VERY CLEAR

04:17:45.850 --> 04:17:47.351
THAT THEY HAVE A CHANCE RIGHT

04:17:47.418 --> 04:17:49.587
THERE. TO OPT IN OR OPT OUT TO
