THIS YOUNG. OKAY LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONNECTED. THANK YOU. I MEAN REMARKS. WE CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU WELL GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CARILLO AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IT IS REALLY AN HONOR OF A LIFETIME TO BE ABLE TO SERVICE CALIFORNIA'S FIRST LATINO LABOR SECRETARY PARTICULARLY AT THIS CRUCIAL MOMENT IN WHICH THE STATE'S PANDEMIC RECOVERY IS TAKING PLACE ALONGSIDE OTHER SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC SHIFTS RELATED TO CLIMATE AND HEALTH CARE. THE BUDGET THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED FOR TODAY'S REALLY INTENTIONALLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT THE LABOR AGENCY REMAINS WELL POSITIONED TO HELP EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS MEET THE NEW DEMANDS CREATED BY THE INTERSECTION OF THESE ECONOMIC SHIFTS. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY THEY ARE THE AGENCY LEADERS WHO REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO SERVE AND SUPPORTS THE ENFORCEMENT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION ECOSYSTEM. THAT SUPPORTS OUR WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS. THEIR WORK AND DEDICATION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THEIR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO THEIR CORRECT THEIR TIRELESS WORK BOTH THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND AS WE ENTER THIS NEW STAGE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE WORLD WHEN YOU PART OF MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY HAS CHANGED I'D LIKE TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR WORK AND OUR MISSION. FIRST WE ARE AIMING TO ADDRESSING YOU WORKFORCE DEMANDS IN SECTORS SUCH AS HEALTH CARE AND ENERGY. WHILE ALSO FACING UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES RELATED TO HIRING AND RETENTION. SECOND WHILE WE WORK CARBON NEUTRALITY AND CLIMATE JUSTICE FOR COMMUNITIES WE FACE A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS IN THIS TRANSITION IN INDUSTRIES AND TO DO SO IN A MANNER THAT PRESUMES LESS AND LISTENS FOR. THIRD AS WE TRACK AND FEEL GRATEFUL FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND PROMISING FUTURE WE MUST DO SO WHILE ALSO FOCUSING ON THE DIFFICULT TRUTHS BUT THE PANDEMIC ON COVERED. IT IS FACT THAT PERVASIVE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INJUSTICES CONTINUE TO EXIST AND HAVE GROWN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. IT IS FACT THAT THESE INEQUITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY ADVERSELY AND DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WOMEN INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES RURAL COMMUNITIES AND HEARTBREAKINGLY BUT OFTEN FOR GARDEN OUR YOUTH. IT IS ALSO FACT THAT THE DISCONNECTION AND THE POVERTY THAT INEQUITY PERPETUATES RESULT IN GROWING SOCIAL COSTS AND LIMITS HOW QUICKLY WE CAN RESPOND AND ADAPT TO THE DEMANDS OF OUR SHIFTING ECONOMY. THIS BUDGET RECOGNIZES THE DISTRICTS AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO RESHAPE AND REIMAGINE OUR STATE PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR INVOLVING ECONOMY WHILE ALSO LIBERATING OURSELVES FROM THE STUBBORN AND PERVASIVE INEQUITIES. SPEAKING OF INEQUITY WE HEAR THE TERM EQUITY SO MUCH THESE DAYS IN THE MEDIA IN POLITICS AND ACADEMIA EVEN IN OUR OWN POLICY AND OPERATIONAL DISCUSSIONS. BUT THE GROSS INJUSTICES AND THE COSTS THAT INEQUITY CREATE WON'T DISAPPEAR SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WILL THAT THE TO OR BECAUSE WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON THE BACK FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THEY EXIST. AT THE LEVER REGENCYWE AIM TO COMBAT IN EQUITY BY REMOVING SYSTEMIC BARRIERS FOR POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED FROM OUR WORKFORCE AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. BY DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO READY TO REIMAGINE AND TEST STRATEGIES THAT CREEK BROUGHT SYSTEMS CHANGE AND BY PUSHING FOR SYSTEMS CHANGE WHICH RECOGNIZES THAT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THOSE ARTISTS TO START. AND I WILL REPEAT THAT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THOSE ARTISTS TO SERVE IS THE KEY TO SUSTAINABLE ADOPTABLE AND MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. GROWTH AND PROSPERITY FOR ALL. INVESTMENTS IN THIS BUDGET AND A COMMITMENT TO EXECUTING THEM WITH A FOCUS ON COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP EMPOWERMENT AND INNOVATION INTO TO JUST THAT TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE FUTURE ECONOMY WHILE ALSO LIFTING OF THOSE DISCONNECTED FROM THE CURRENT ECONOMY. THE BUDGET ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT WE CAN'T MAKE THIS CHANGE ALONE OUR BUSINESSES ENTREPRENEURS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE PIONEERS OF ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS THE MERIT AND REQUIRE SUPPORT TO SUCCESSFULLY MEET THE DEMANDS OF PIONEERING INTO OUR FUTURE. SO HOW DO WE GET THERE. HOW DO SUPPORT WORKERS BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES DURING THIS TRANSITION WHILE MEETING NEW ECONOMIC DEMANDS BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS AND MODERNIZING THE WAY WE SERVE CALIFORNIANS. FOR THE LABOR AGENCY IT'S ABOUT INTENTIONAL INVESTMENT AND FOCUS ON THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS THE BUDGET THAT YOU WILL DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY IS DRIVEN BY A FEW DISTINCT PRIORITIES. NUMBER ONE. THE UNDENIABLE AND PRESSING DEMANDS FOR NEW BETTER AND MORE INCLUSIVE HEALTH CARE JOBS AND PATHWAYS THAT WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED AND EQUITABLE HEALTH OUTCOMES ACROSS THE STATE. NUMBER TWO WORKFORCE STRATEGIES AND INNOVATION THAT MEETS OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN A MANNER THAT RECOGNIZES THE CHALLENGES FACED BY TRANSITIONING WORKFORCES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. NUMBER THREE A RENEWED FOCUS ON THE IMMENSE VALUE OF CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE AND THE RECOGNITION THAT CONNECTING THEM TO THE EVOLVING ECONOMY REQUIRES INCREASING ACCESS TO LANGUAGE AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING THAT MEETS BOTH THEIR PERSONAL CAREER TRAJECTORIES AND THEIR EMPLOYERS MEETS. NUMBER FOUR. CONTINUED MODERNIZATION OF THE U. R. SYSTEM TO IMPROVE CLEAN ACCESS AND EXPERIENCE BOTH WHILE ASSURING LONG TERM RESILIENCE AND KEEPING OUR DOORS SHUT TO FRAUD. AND IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING AS A FORMER FEDERAL WORKPLACE INVESTIGATOR THAT A CONTINUED FOCUS ON PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR WORKPLACE IS THE BASIC REQUIREMENT TO ASSURING THE INCREASE VOICE SAFETY AND DIGNITY THAT ALL WORKERS NEED IN ORDER TO SHAPE THE PERSONAL GROWTH AND MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE BROADER ECONOMY. IN CLOSING I WANT TO REITERATE HOW INNOVATIVE AND UNPRECEDENTED THIS BUDGET IS IT INCLUDES ELEMENTS THAT ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE THE HARD WORK OF RESPONDING TO COATED WHILE ALSO SENDING A MESSAGE OF HOPE. ABOUT HOW WE CAN RECOVER DIFFERENTLY AND BETTER THAN WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WITH INVESTMENTS THAT FOCUS ON EXPANDING OPPORTUNITY CREATING BROADER ENTRY INTO THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE SYSTEM. AS IT LEAVES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TOWARD A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STUFF FOR YOUR TIME NOT JUST TODAY BUT FOR ALL THE WORK YOU DO OUTSIDE OF HEARINGS LIKE TODAY'S TO SHE POLICY THAT SYSTEMS CHANGE AND IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. MY LEADERSHIP TEAM IS PRESENT AND READY TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS CRUCIAL AND MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN OUR WORK FORCE.

ANDREW MARCH PRINCIPLE PROGRAM BUDGET ANALYST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PATRICK TOPPIN.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY TO UPDATE YOU ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS. AS WELL AS SOME OF THE PROGRESS MADE OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS AT EDT FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS NANCY FERRIS I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE- EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND WITH ME HERE TODAY AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MENTIONS IS- TEAM OF FOLKS AND WHILE I'M EVER SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS TEAM WITH ME TODAY I WOULD BE REMISS IN NOT ACKNOWLEDGING AND THANKING THE STAFF WHO ARE NOT WITH ME TODAY. THOSE ARE DOING THE WORK THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT CALIFORNIANS THOSE IN THE CALL CENTER THOSE PULLING AND ANALYZING DATA SO WE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. AND THE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES ARE DEDICATED TO HELPING PEOPLE NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITY THAT CAN BE YOU DD. ESPECIALLY AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT TIMES I THINK THAT IS AN IMMENSE TEMAS FERRIS I'M SO SORRY BEFORE YOU CONTINUE- AFTER YOUR PRESENTATION CAN YOU PLEASE HAVE YOUR TEAM PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE OPERATION AND FRAUD PREVENTION RELATED TO THE PC PIECE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. MAY GO STRAIGHT TO THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY MAY HAVE MY APOLOGY STATEMENT TO SAY THAT BEFORE YOU BEGAN. YEP NO THAT'S FINE WE HAVE CALEB THAT WILL DO THAT THANK YOU- I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA ALL THE STAFF AT EDT SO I'M JUST GONNA JUMP RIGHT IN AND HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT I'VE MADE OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS SO. IN RESPONSE TO RISING NUMBERS OF CLAIMANTS WAITING FOR BENEFITS EARLY LAST YEAR WE LAUNCHED A NEW PAIN NOW PROGRAM THAT EXPEDITED OUT THAT TIME APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PAYMENTS. THESE CLAIMS WERE PAID IMMEDIATELY AS EDT CONTINUES ITS WORK TO VERIFY ELIGIBILITY. WHILE THESE CLAIMANTS ARE NO LONGER WAITING FOR PAYMENT THE DEPARTMENTS WORK TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY REMAINS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND CLAIM IT'S STILL REQUIRED INTERVIEW TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY EVEN IF THEY ALREADY RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS. TO BETTER MANAGE THE PROCESSING OF THOSE CLAIMS WE BOOSTED BENDER STOPPING THANKS TO THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR IN CROSS TRAINED MORE STAFF TO HANDLE COMMON ISSUES REQUIRING INTERVIEWS AND CONTINUE TO SHIP STOCK. TORT CLAIM DETERMINATION. WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS A WRITTEN BY AUSTIN AIR IN FOR A PHONE CALL INTERVIEW MARC. GAP ELEGY. IN AND OR TO MAKE A- AND MUCH LESS TIME. MEANWHILE AS I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN ON THE NEWS WE CONTINUE TO FEND OFF AGGRESSIVE FRAUD ATTEMPTS FROM THOSE WHO ATTACKED STATE UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEMS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OUR EXPANDED PROTECTION MEASURES INCLUDING THE CONTRACTS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY. BLOCKED OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN FRAUD ATTEMPTS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE FRAUD PREVENTION CONTRACTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASSIST US IN PAYING CLAIMS TIMELY. WHILE CONTINUING TO PREVENT SCAMMERS FROM INFILTRATING OUR SYSTEMS ON THE FRONT. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE MANY CONCERNS OF THIS COMMITTEE REGARDING THE OVER PAYMENT PROCESS AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE RECEIVED PAYMENTS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. YOUR CONCERNS ARE MY CONCERNS AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW POINTS ON THIS. CURRENTLY WE ARE NOT ESTABLISHING OVER PAYMENTS FOR FEDERAL BENEFITS AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE WORKFORCE AGENCIES. NASA CONTINUES TO LEAD DISCUSSIONS ON THIS TOPIC WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND CONGRESS. WE SHARE THE CONCERNS IT'S A CONCERN THAT CLAIMANTS WHO ARE NON FRAUD NON FAULT. SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GET A BLANKET WAIVER THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AGREED JUST A WEEK OR SO AGO AND ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE REGARDING BLANKET WAIVERS. AND YOU CAN BE SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN'T TO BE FLEXIBLE FOR THIS NON. FRAUDULENT POPULATION. ONE LAST UPDATE ON OUR FRAUD PREVENTION MEASURES IS THE PROGRESS OF FORMER U. S. ATTORNEY MCGREGOR SCOTT- EDT HIRED AS BROAD SPECIAL COUNSEL LAST YEAR. I CAN PERSONALLY SAY THAT GREG AND HIS TEAMHAVE HAD A VAST IMPACT AND IMPACT IN PARSING THROUGH THE SUSPECTED FRAUD OF TWENTY TWENTY. ONE OF GREG'S MOST HELPFUL ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAS BEEN FACILITATING ACCESS TO EVIDENCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS WAS ONE OF EDIE'S BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE FEDERAL STATE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO HELP GET THE DATA TO THEM QUICKLY WHEN IT WAS NEEDED. NOW INSTEAD OF A LENGTHY SUBPOENA PROCESS GREG HAS HELPED TO FACILITATE ANIMAL YOU PROCESS WHICH EDT AUTOMATED. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HAS NOW HAS AN IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE DATA FOR THE CASES THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING. WELL CLEARLY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS STILL IN THE INVESTIGATION STAGE FOR MANY OF THESE FRAUD CASES GREG WORKS WITH ID ME THOMSON REUTERS AND ACCENTURE. TO LEVERAGE THE FRAUD ANALYTICS NEEDED TO PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE DATA AND EVIDENCE BUT THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES. SO THEY CAN MOVE INTO THE NEXT COUPLE OF STAGES WHICH IS OF COURSE PROSECUTION. AND RESTITUTION TO EDT. THE RECESSION BECAUSE BY COLD NINETEEN FOLLOWED ISTORY PATTERN. UNEMPLOYMENT FROM RECORD LOWS OF THREE POINT 9% TO SIXTEEN POINT 4% IN TWO MONTHS THE FASTEST RISE EVER RECORDED. EVERY STATE HAS HAD TO RETHINK WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY KNEW ABOUT RECESSION PLANNING. UNDER S. B. NINETY THREE NINETY BY SENATOR LEHRER. EDT CRAFTED A VERY THOROUGH PLAN TO BETTER PREPARE FOR FUTURE EMERGENCIES AND ECONOMIC RECESSIONS. I KNEW PLAN INCLUDES CAREFUL MONITORING OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND RIGOROUS WORKLOAD FORECASTING TIED TO STATE AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS. WE ARE ALSO ANALYZING JOB DUTY CLASSIFICATIONS TO ENSURE STAFF ARE DEPLOYED AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. FINALLY EDT WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS THAT HELP CUSTOMERS AVOID THE NEED TO SPEAK WITH EDT STAFF IN THE FIRST PLACE. A RECESSION PLAN IS DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE BY MARCH FIRST AND WE ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL BRIEFINGS ON ITS CONTENT ONCE IT'S TRANSMITTED. MANY OF THE REFORMS AND BUDGET REQUESTS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY COME FROM THE WELL THOUGHT OUT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AS WELL AS THE EDT STRIKE TEAM. WE HAVE MET EVERY DEADLINE STEP BY THE AUDITOR AND SEVENTEEN OF THE TWENTY ONE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMPLETE EIGHTY ONE PERCENT. THE REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS ARE WELL UNDERWAYINCLUDE HIRING AND TRAINING THE STAFF TO CARRY OUT WORKLOAD PLANNING AND IDENTIFYING AREAS FOR FUTURE AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSING. THE EDT STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS OF WHICH THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED OR SLIGHTLY OVER ONE HUNDRED. THE SHORT TERM AND NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS. AS WE HAVE MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS AND FULL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE CREATED A PUBLIC AUDIT PROGRESS REPORT WEBPAGE. THAT DETAILS THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND I HOPE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION. AND COMPLETION OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IS A PRIORITY OF MINE IN MY NEW ROLE AS DIRECTOR SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION PROJECTS WERE PLANNED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN COPING NINETEEN TESTED- SYSTEM THING CAPABILITIES TO THEIR LIMITS AND CAUSE US TO RETHINK SOME OF OUR APPROACHES. IN RESPONSE WE REVISE THE DIRECTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION WORK. TO BRING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN HANDLE MORE EXTREME SEARCHES AND CLAIM ACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN LANGUAGE AND USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS CARRYING ON A MISSION TO PROCLAIM ITS FIRST. DURING THIS PANDEMIC EDT IS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BLANK BRANCH DELIVERED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TECHNOLOGY PROJECT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPEED PAYMENT. IS MUCH MORE WORK TO COME I LOOK FORWARD TO UPDATING THE LEGISLATURE AS WE PROGRESS- PROGRESS OVER THE NEXT YEAR. AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH THE TREMENDOUS HELP OF THIS COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU CHAIR CARILLO AND OF COURSE MR TANG AS BUDGET CHAIR. EDT EXPANDED AND IMPROVED ITS LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. THIS INCLUDES MORE TRANSLATION INTERPRETER SERVICES INCLUDING A MULTI LINGUAL ACCESS PORTAL. AS WE ALL OF WHERE ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIANS COMMUNICATE IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU NEED TO CONTINUE THIS WORK. RECENTLY EDT EXPANDED TRANSLATION SERVICES AND TRAIN FRONTLINE STAFF TO CONNECT CALLERS WITH TRANSLATE TRANSLATORS EXCUSE ME CAN NOW ASSISTING HUNDREDS OF LANGUAGES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND SUPPORT AND AS MANY LANGUAGES AS NEEDED TO INSURE THIS POPULATION IS WELL SERVED.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THESE REQUESTS AND MYSELF MY COLLEAGUES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOLLOWED BY THE ALEJO. FROM THE FINANCE. THANK YOU BETTER TOP IN THE BARBARA FINANCE COMPANY HAD NO FURTHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. LOL GOOD AFTERNOON CHANNEL WITH THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE WE HAVE MARKS RELATED TO B. C. P. ONE AND THE SYSTEMATIC GROUPING I'M AT THE B. C. P. FOR VENDOR SERVICE AS A LAST WEEK OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED A REPORT ON IT SIX I'LL BE OF PUT CONTRACTS IN THE VENDOR SERVICES BCPL- SIX CONTRACTS. THAT IN OUR VIEW WORSE- SPECIFIC TO THE STATE FRAUD SPECIFIC- IN A REPORT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONLY APPROVED ONE OF THOSE SIX CONTRACTS ON THE CONTRACT THAT WE RECOMMEND APPROVING AT THIS POINT IS TO PREVENT BOT ATTACKS THAT COULD DISRUPT OR SHUT DOWN EDIE'S WEBSITE- DURING CRITICAL TIMES WE ARE RECOGNIZED WITH A HOLDING ACTION OR REJECTING THE OTHER FIVE CONTRACTS. AND WOULD MAKE THIS RECOMMENDATION. FOR THREE KEY REASONS OUR FIRST. THAT HAS DEPARTMENT POINTED OUT. ALMOST ALL OF THE- THAT. DURING THE PANDEMIC IN THE U. I. PROGRAM TARGETED A TEMPORARY FEDERAL. BENEFIT PROGRAMS FOR SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS. AND DOES LITTLE PROGRAMS HAVE ENDED THEY ENDED IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO GOING FORWARD. THAT RISK EXPOSURE FOR THE STATE NO LONGER EXISTS. AND CERTAINLY ON THE OTHER HAND FOR THE STATE'S SORT OF LONG STANDING REGULAR YOU AYE PROGRAM UP FRONT DURING A PANDEMIC APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY MINOR. I MEAN THIS IS A QUICKLY BECAUSE THE STATE'S PROGRAM HAS. BUILT IN SAFEGUARDS THAT THE FUNDS WILL PROGRAM IT DOES NOT HAVE OR DO NOT HAVE. MADE IT MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND FINALLY. WE MAKE THIS RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE MOVING FORWARD AT THIS TIME WITH ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF FRAUD PREVENTION RUNS COUNTER IN OUR VIEW. TO THE MINISTRATIONS OWN INSPECTION REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS. THEREFORE MOVED APARTMENTS ARE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION- BY EMPHASIZING FRAUD ELIMINATION ARE POTENTIALLY AT THE EXPENSE OF. THE DEPARTMENT MAKING PROMPT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD- BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO A TOWN EMPLOYED WORKERS AT THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFICALLY THAT I'M POINTING OUT HERE HAS TO DO WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S REVIEW. ANTI FRAUD EFFORTS NOT ONLY FOR THEIR EFFECTIVENESS BUT ALSO TAKING ACCOUNT THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS- AND WE ELEVATE THIS RECORDED AT THIS TIME BECAUSE WE CAN ARGUE. ABOUT SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS STEPS DURING THE PANDEMIC- THAT WERE WERE ANTI FRAUD IN NATURE HAD SUBSTANTIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE JEMAINE CLEMENT'S- AND. AND MORE WEIGHT- CONSIDERING THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMEND THAT ACTION. ON I DO WANT TO POINT OUT ONE- ADDITIONAL ELEMENT- OF ARE NOW- WE RECOMMEND WITHHOLDING ACTION. SPECIFICALLY ARE THE CAR. FOR I DO VERIFICATION WITH THE- THAT THE CONTRACTOR ID ME. AND THAT'S A BIT OF CONTEXT- ARE THE STATE SET UP HIDING ME IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY- ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE STRIKE TEAM AND I DO MEAN THAT ABSENCE CONFIRMS AN APPLICANT IS WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE BY USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO MATCH OUR A VIDEO OR A PHOTO THAT APPLICANT TAKES TO THE- TYPICAL DRIVER'S LICENSE THAT THEY- THAT THEY UPLOAD TO THE WEBSITE- WE'RE COMMITTING WITHHOLDING ACTION. GIVEN THAT THAT THE CRITICAL PERIOD HAS PASSED- SO THAT THE STATE CAN TEND TO PAUSE AND CONSIDER- IT'S APPROACHING WHETHER IT WANTS TO USE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE GOING FORWARD THE STATE'S YOU I SYSTEM. M. THESE COMMENTS COME- WE WANT TO ELEVATE THIS ISSUE. FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND WE OF SOME SCHOOL THAT THE COUNTRY HAS UNDER. WE UNDERSTAND. THAT I DO NEED OUR HEAD INTO TO AGREE WITH STATE WITH OTHERS- DEAL WITH A ONE TWO. FACIAL RECOGNITION MATCH WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY COMPARING BEATING. THE PHOTO OR VIDEO THAT AN APPLICANT SUBMITS WITH THE DRIVER'S LICENSE THAT THE APPLICANTS MEZZO ONE TO ONE- I'M I'M BIG NOW WANTS TO THE STATE AND TO OTHER CLIENTS I DO NEED WAS ALSO. PERFORMING WHAT'S CALLED A ONE TO MANY- MATCH WHICH IS WHERE- THEY WERE REVIEWING USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THE PHOTO OR VIDEO APPLICANTS SUBMITTED AGAINST A LARGE DATA BANK OF MILLIONS OF PHOTOS. OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO APPLIED. FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE NOW. THIS COULD FIGURE ZERO. I'M HELP REDUCE FRAUD OR BROWN DURING DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT BECAUSE THIS WAS PUMPING OUT TO THIS- THERE ARE SOME SOME MAJOR RED FLAGS THAT THAT- PRIVACY EXPERTS HAVE HAVE RAISED WITH REGARD TO THESE ONE SO MANY MATCHES AND FOR THAT REASON WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MY WANT TO TAKE SOME TIME NOW TO CONSIDER THE ROLE OF ID ME OR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY FOR THE STATE IN THE U. I. PROGRAM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR ALAMO FOR THAT- I HAVE THE- JUST COMMON IN A QUESTION RELATED TO THAT AND THEN OPEN IT UP TO THE MEMBERS. THE L. A. ALSO SAYS MEN REGARDING THE USE OF ID ME BRINGS UP. SERIOUS QUESTIONS OF REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF A. I. DRIVEN FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ITS IMPLICATIONS ON PRIVACY. ITS POTENTIAL FOR HARMFUL RACIAL BIAS. AS CALIFORNIA MOVES BEYOND THE PANDEMIC THE LEGISLATURE WILL ENGAGE WITH THE EDT. STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC TO DETERMINE THE BEST APPROACH. TO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY DELIVER CRITICAL BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS. WELL SAFEGUARDING THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY TO THAT END. DOES EDT PLANNING CONTINUING TO USE FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. IF THE STATE DECIDES TO MOVE AWAY FROM FACIAL RECOGNITION WILL EDT ABLE TO CONTINUE. AUTOMATING ITS CURRENT PRODUCT FRAUD PREVENTION MEASURES. MISS VARIOUS I TURN IT OVER TO YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- IT SO RECENTLY YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT ID ME AND THE IRS- ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT CONTRACT AS A GUIDE FOR WHAT WE WOULD DO AND WHAT THEY'RE BASICALLY DOING. IS ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO EITHER UPLOAD A SELFIE AND THEN DELETE THE SELFIE OR TO GO THROUGH A TRUSTED REFEREE WHICH IS ON A LIVE PERSON- YOU KNOW INTO THE L. A. ALWAYS POINT. YOU KNOW WE DO WANT TO MAKE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS AND RIGHT NOW WE SEE THE DATA IN OUR DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM WE SEE THE ACTUAL FRAUD IN THE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW WE ALSO GET UPDATES FROM- FBI FOR EXAMPLE AND THE DARK WEB YOU KNOW AND IN FACT JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THE FBI ISSUED A MEDIA ADVISORY WARNING ABOUT SCAMMERS EXPLOITING JOB BOARDS AND SOCIAL MEDIA SITES TO IMPERSONATE. LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO GET YOU WHY- SO WE CERTAINLY ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO USE ID NY WITHOUT FACIAL RECOGNITION AND WE SEE NO REASON. WHY WE CAN'T FOLLOW WHAT THE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW DOING. THANK YOU ALL JUST FOLLOW UP WITH THE A QUICK COMMENT THAT WE SAW IN THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT HEARING SOME AT THE PANDEMIC WITH REGARD TO ID ME AND THE LACK OF ACCESS TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THAT DID NOT GET TO RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS ON TIME SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE A SMARTPHONE THEY DID NOT HAVE. ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND SO EVEN BEING ABLE TO USE AN APPLICATION ON THE PHONE IS STILL INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO THE MEMBERS OF MISTER LUCKY. YES CERTAINLY THANK YOU IF I CAN ASK A REAL QUICKLY WHAT'S THE STATUS OF EDIE'S FRAUD UNIT THAT WAS TO BE FULLY STAFFED AS OF NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DO WE HAVE pIT'S FULLY STAFFED ACTUALLY YEAH- MAYBE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES CAN. THAT'S CORRECT- HI ANNE FAULKNER EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ACTING CHIEF DEPUTY OF OUR OPERATIONS- THE FRAUD UNIT THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. IS NOW CURRENTLY FULLY STAFFED AND OPERATIONAL AND CAN I ASK WHAT IS FULLY STAFFED I MEAN. HOW MANY DO WE HAVE. I CAN ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT ANYTHING CUTE HI GUYS HITS STATEN- EDT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BRANCH AND WE ACTUALLY STAFF UPDATED COMPLETE SECTION WITHIN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. THAT INCLUDES- A SECTION MANAGER TO- MANAGERS TO SPECIFIC UNITS AND THEN FOUR TO SIX STAFF WITHIN- THOSE SPECIFIC UNIT SO THE FRONT SECTION IN OF ITSELF ENCOMPASSES APPROXIMATELY TWELVE INDIVIDUALS. THANK A TOUGH JOB. TWELVE TWELVE PEOPLE. OKAY- I JUST WONDERED- BECAUSE THAT OPENS A PANDORA'S BOX FOR A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS THAT THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR ME TO ASK THEM BUT- THANK YOU FOR AT LEAST ANSWERING THAT I GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT AND IF I CAN ASK WHAT WHAT IS HE UPDATE TO THE DEPARTMENT SEPARATE TO CONTACT CALIFORNIA CLAIMANTS. OF THE P. U. A. SLASH P. U. E. C. PROGRAM WITH PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY. DO YOU HAVE ANY UPDATE ON THE- GOOD SEVENTY TO EIGHTY I'M IF YOU'RE SUFFERING TO- SPECIFICALLY THE SELF EMPLOYMENT IMPLEMENTS INSTANTIATION THAT WERE REQUIRED TO- HAVE CONSTITUENTS RESPOND TO VERIFY THAT THE INFORMATION WHEN THE INITIALLY FILED ITS TRUE- AND IN DOING SO THEY NEED TO PROVIDE AND FURNISH DOCUMENTATION. IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THEIR STATEMENTS WERE TRUE CORRECT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE'RE TAKING A PHASED APPROACH SO THE FIRST PHASE I'M IS AN ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATION OR LINKS HAVE BEEN SENT TO CONSTITUENTS SUCH ADVISE THEM TO UPLOAD THEIR NECESSARY DOCUMENTS- THAT'S THE FIRST PHASE SECOND PHASE WILL INCLUDE ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO DID NOT RESPOND TO PHASE ONE. THEY'LL BE FOLDED INTO PHASE TWO WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS- AND NOTIFIED VIA ANOTHER LINK AND IN ADDITION TO A MAILED NOTICE SO THAT THEY CAN RESPOND IN WHICHEVER AVENUE THAT THE STATUES. OKAY AND FINALLY MY LAST QUESTION IS HOW IS YOUR DEPARTMENT DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN ASSISTING THOSE WITH FINANCIAL HARDSHIP WITH OVERPAYMENTS AND THOSE ARE GUILTY OF. FRAUD BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY DISTINCT. DIFFERENT POPULAR. I CAN ALSO TAKE THAT ONE- SO COULD A SECOND WITH EDT KIND OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE OPERATIONS FUNCTION TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE- AND ENSURE THAT WERE APPROPRIATELY APPLYING THE BLANKET WAIVER SPECIFICALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELEASED I'M DOING WELL RELEASED SEVEN DIFFERENT WAIVER BLANKET WAIVER CONSIDERATIONS IN AS WE PROCESS THE WORKLOADS AND IDENTIFY THAT THE CONSTITUENT MAY HAVE FALLEN UNDER AND- A CRITERIA THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THEIR OVERCAME IT WAIVED BECAUSE THE OVER PAYMENT WAS DUE TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL PRODUCT AND THERE'S NO FAULT- WE WILL APPLY THAT. WAVERED THAT LINCOLN WEAVER TOOK OVER PAYMENT AND THERE'S NO ACTION THAT'S NEEDED BY THE CONSTITUENT WE WILL NOTIFY THEM THAT THEY OVERPAID THE OVERPAYMENT AMOUNT WE'RE REQUIRED BY LAW TO NOTICE THEM HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BE WAIVED AND THAT THEY'RE THEY HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY THE BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY WERE PAID TO THEM. WITHOUT THEIR FAULTOR TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN- AND IT WOULD BE AGAINST EQUITY AND GOOD CONSCIENCE NOW WITH RESPECT TO FRIDAY SPECIFIC OR THOSE THAT ARE AT FAULT WE ARE PROCESSING THOSE- AS- AS- STANDARD BUSINESS WE APPLY SPECIFIC THOSE THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE BEEN- A FALSE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF OBTAINING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS. APPLYING A 30% PENALTY TO THE OVERPAYMENT AND ENSURING THAT WE CONTINUE THROUGH COLLECTION PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU. IT WILL GO TO MISS WHAT'S MISTREATING AND MISTER COOPER THANK YOU THIS QUESTIONS FOR- MYSTERIOUS- OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A JOURNEY WITH ATV OVER THE PAST COUPLE EARS- AND THERE'S BEEN CHALLENGES- ON YOUR ALL'S AND OBVIOUSLY NO ONE ANTICIPATED THIS PANDEMIC BUT- IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT AS YOU ALL KNOW IN TERMS OF- US BEING ABLE TO RESPOND TO OUR CONSTITUENTS- YOU KNOW MANY OF WHOM HAVE WAITED. MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS FOR PAYMENT- IN ADDITION THAT OBVIOUSLY THE FRAUD AND ABUSE HAS BEEN CHALLENGING- CAN YOU ARTICULATE HOW EASY WOULD BE PREPARED TO WITHSTAND ANOTHER SURGE IN YOU I CLAIM SHOULD THAT HAPPEN OR AN INCREASE IN AN UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS RISE- IN ADDITION TO- DEALING WITH THAT THE FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY AS WELL JUST HOW WHAT IS THE- YOU KNOW AGENCY LEARNED IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THAT WOULD- HOPEFULLY MITIGATE AGAINST WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. AND IN OUR ABILITY TO SERVE OUR CONSTITUENTS BETTER. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU- I WILL SAY THAT THAT IS ALL IN OUR RECESSION PLAN THAT'S COMING OUT ON MARCH FIRST- THERE IS A- VERY DETAILED- PIECE OF IT THAT TALKS ABOUT ANOTHER RECESSION. IT'S PART OF WHAT THE BCP IS THAT- GRASSY AT THAT THAT CALEB SPOKE ABOUT IN YOU WHY. AS FAR AS THE- ADDING ON TO THE COMMAND CENTER IN THE FORECASTING. OF THAT SO WE WILL- WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO BRIEF THE LEGISLATURE ON- ARE RECESSION PLANNED IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. IT'S IT WILL IT WILL BE A BRIEFING IT'S IT'LL BE A IT'LL BE A WHILE. THEY'LL BE A LONG BREAK THINGS BUT I'M TRYING TO SAY BECAUSE IT'S A LONG PROCESS PLAN. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE BOTH- ADDRESSING FOR. FOLKS TRYING TO GET THEIR EMPLOYMENT AS WELL AS THE FRAUDULENT PIECES WHILE. I'M IT DOES IT DOES INCLUDE IT DOES INCLUDE BOTH YES I MEAN AS FAR AS THAT THE FRAUDULENT JEEZ THAT MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE PIECE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON NOW. YOU KNOW- GOING THROUGH THE- YOU KNOW SUSPECTED FRAUD THAT WE HAVE FIGURING OUT- YOU KNOW WE USED A METHODOLOGY WHEN THE AUDITOR CAME IN WE USED TO CERTAIN METHODOLOGY- TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS SUSPECTED FRAUD. AND SO NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS GOING THROUGH THAT WITH THE HELP OF ID NEED THOMSON REUTERS ACCENTURE. TO DETERMINE WHAT ACTUALLY WAS FRAUD. AND WHAT WAS ON TO THE ALEJO'S POINT POSSIBLY SOMEONE THAT JUST DIDN'T RESPOND TO EDT AND I THINK WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT AND A LOT OF- YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT BILLS THAT WILL SERVE AS A GUIDE. ON TO HOW WE RESPOND TO THE. NEXT RECESSION GREAT THANK YOU. MMHM THANK YOU MISS WATSON I WOULD NOTE THAT IF WE RECALL AMID THE PANDEMIC FOLKS WERE ALSO BEING EVICTED WHICH IS WHY WE ESTABLISH THE EVICTION MORATORIUM AS LACK OF WAGES LACK OF BEING ABLE TO PAY THEIR TELEPHONE OR CELL PHONE BILLS ALL OF THAT CONTRIBUTED TO PERHAPS A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS NOT BEING ABLE TO RETURN A PHONE CALL OR RETURN A LETTER OR NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THEIR TO THEIR BENEFITS. MISTER COOPER. MR KING FIRSTERS. HELLO OF COURSE OF MYSTERIOUS- HOW MANY INVESTIGATIONS OF THE D. OPENED RELATED TO FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. AB CURRENTLY HAS ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY INVESTIGATIONS THIS IS JUST EDT. AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY BEEN PROSECUTED- THERE'S BEEN OVER TWO HUNDRED ARRESTS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HAVE BEEN PROSECUTE- LOOKS LIKE ABOUT TWENTY OR SO WHAT WERE THOSE ARRESTS COMMITTED BY EASY DEAR LOCAL AGENCIES. ARE MADE EXCUSE ME HOW WE WORK IT USUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT. SELL ONE ARREST IS MADE INVESTIGATIVE DISCOVERY BANK ACCOUNT WILL POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT FUNDS WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE FUNDS. SO THAT WE ARE WORKING ON THAT CURRENTLY- YOU KNOW IMEAN THERE IS- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RESTITUTION TO EDT WHICH USUALLY DOESN'T OCCUR UNTIL AFTER THE PERSON SERVES THEIR TIME IN PRISON- BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT- DIFFERENT WAYS TO COLLECT SOME OF BAD RESTITUTION- ABOVE AND BEYOND THE ADMINISTRATIVE WAY THAT WE DO IT NOW BECAUSE- WE'VE NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF FRAUD BEFORE SO WE'VE NEVER HAD TO THINK ABOUT DOING IT A DIFFERENT WAY- BUT WE ARE WE DO HAVE A WORKING GROUP BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH- THE GREGORY SCOTT. ON FIGURING OUT HOW TO COLLECT THAT THOSE FUNDS AS MANY PHONE RECOVERED TODAY. I YES I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN- FONG COLLECTED. TWO DATES- I ORDERED BY THE COURT I'M NOT SURE IF COLLECTED YET ORDERED BY THE COURT RESTITUTION WHICH AGAIN USUALLY OCCURS AS YOU KNOW AFTER- A PRISON SENTENCE OKAY SO WE MAY NOT SEE THAT FOR A WHILE AND THERE ACTUALLY IS A BILL THIS YEAR AB SIXTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE TAXPAYER RECOVERY ACT. WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR SOME REAL FUN TO BE RECOVERED- THROUGHOUT THE FORFEITURE BUT ANOTHER QUESTION ACCORDING TO THE STATE AUDITOR ET THE PAST PAID OUT ABOUT A HUNDRED A HUNDRED TEN MILLION INCARCERATE INDIVIDUALS. HOW MUCH EASIER COVER FROM THE FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS TO INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. SO I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE- THAT WAS STOLEN IDENTITY SO THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A PERSON IT COULD BE A PRISONER OR COULD BE SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF- PRISON WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE PERSON WHO IS IN PRISON- I DO KNOW THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL I THINK ARREST EVEN JUST LAST WEEK- WORK IN FACT I THINK IT WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THEN THE DA'S WORKING TOGETHER. THERE IS ONE FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE SO THEY ARE WORKING. WE'RE SORT OF IN THE INVESTIGATION STAGE RIGHT NOW OF A LOT OF THESE- FRAUD CASES- SO I MEAN I ANTICIPATE IN THE NEXT YOU KNOW AGAIN AFTER. THERE'S PROSECUTION AND RESTITUTION AFTER- A PRISON SENTENCE I EXPECT US TO COLLECT SOME OF THAT. UNDER MR SCOTT MISTY ON IT SAID THE MONEY WILL COLLECT WE PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR REARDING THAT. AND GOING BACK TO YOUR TO YOUR UNIT THAT YOU GUYS STOOD UP WITH YOU YOU CALL THE POLICE. ESTO IN PLACE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. AND NONE OF THOSE EMPLOYEES AND THAT INVESTIGATIVE UNIT- SWORN OFFICERS ARE THEY- ARE THEY ARE POST CERTIFIED IN THE INVESTIGATIONS UNIT. OKAY BUT IT BUT IN A SWORN OFFICERS AND POSTED A FLOOD. BECAUSE AUTHOR GOTTEN THE FEEL THE NEWS INVESTIGATIONS AND ACTUALLY MAKE ARRESTS. I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS NO MY CORRECT. I BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN. I'M NOT SURE IF THEY CAN ARREST TO BE HONEST MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS THAT. ANSWER. I KNOW THAT THEY YEAH I'M NOT SURE OKAY I GUESS MY CONCERN IS IT YOU HAVE SOMEBODY DOING INVESTIGATION CIVILIAN AND THEN THEY HAVE TO THE INFORMATION OVER AND REGURGITATE THAT TO US ONE OFFICER VERSES IF YOU'RE A SWORN OFFICER THAT WOULD DO THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION IT'S A IT'S A SMOOTH TRANSITION BECAUSE THERE THERE'S NO MIDDLE MAN OR GO BETWEEN ON THAT AND THAT SEEMS TO BE IN A BIG ISSUE SO I DO HAVE CONCERN WITH THAT AND AS FAR AS A PRIVACY ISSUE A. I. DOES HAVE A- A PLACE HERE WE USE FACIAL RECOGNITION A LOT FOR DIFFERENT THINGS. AND YOU KNOW IT IT DOESN'T WORK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS I THINK WHEN YOU TAKE THE LEVEL OF FRAUD THAT WAS COMMITTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA- IT WAS THE BOARD'S FROM HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY SO EXTRAORDINARY TIMES CALL FOR EXTRAORDINARY MEANS AND FOR YES SOME PEOPLE IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE THE ADVOCATES OF THE PROPONENTS WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW WE WANT ANYBODY. BEING OUT OF. BEING USED. RECOGNITION BUT- THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO PREVENT FRAUD. WE'RE THINKING NOW WITH TI IN THIS RAMPANT. ON WILL NOT TOUCH OUR MAJORITY LEADER AND SHE HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT BECAUSE- SHE'S HEARING FROM HER CONSTITUENTS THE SAME THING. THAT APPLY FOR D. EITHER BEING STUCK IN THE PORTAL. HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING THROUGH. THROUGH EDT A LOT OF ISSUES SO. YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT WE CAN'T LET THIS REPEAT. TO WHAT HAPPENED AND I MEAN ALL WE CAN DO IS GO FORWARD BUT- LIKE I SAID IT'S EASY MONEY OUT HERE DOING THIS YOU'RE NOT ROBBING A BANK IN NOT SELLING DRUGS. THE PENALTIES ARE VERY LOS CONSIDER WHITE COLLAR CRIME. THIS IS VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR. PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING BAD THINGS TO PARTICIPATE IS TOUGHER CRIME SO- HOPEFULLY GET BEHIND I DO THINK ASSET FORFEITURES AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE IT BECAUSE THESE FOLKS HAVE BOUGHT CARS. IN BUT A LOT OF ITEMS SO HOPEFULLY YOU DO YOU DO YOU WILL. WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF IT AND THE ADMINISTRATION BE SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT RIGHT NOW- IF WE DO RUN TO SOME THESE FOLKS. IS A BE TOUGH GETTING THAT MONEY BACK WITHOUT A CHANGE IN OUR CURRENT LOSS I WOULD HOPE THAT- YOU GUYS WOULD- MENTION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND- HOPEFULLY OBTAIN THEIR SUPPORT. SO THANK YOU. I THINK. ON ON ONE OF MY RESPONSES- WE DO HAVE ARREST POWERS. SORTS OR THOSE LIKE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. ARE THOSE TWELVE PEOPLE ALL SWORN OFFICERS FIVE IN OUR INVESTIGATIONS UNIT BUT THAT'S THIRTY FIVE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATORS PEACE OFFICER POSITIONS CORRECT THAT'S STATEWIDE BLEM THIS NEW TASK FORCE THAT WAS STOOD UP THOSE ARE THOSE BILLS PROPOSITIONS OF THOSE CIVILIANS ARE SWORN OFFICERS. YES THOSE ARE CIVILIANS THAT'S A DIFFERENT- THAT'S A DIFFERENCE. UNITS OKAY. THEY WILL WORK TOGETHER WITH THE FRONT WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION UNIT BUT THAT'S- I WANT TO SAY MORE ABOUT BUT THAT'S ABOUT POLICY THAT UNIT THAT'S UNDER YOU WHY THAT'S MORE ABOUT POLICY THAN IT IS ABOUT- INVESTIGATIONS LIKE RIGHTS BUT BUT BUT IF THE CRIB REFORM WRONG MAJORITY THE REST OF THE BEEN MADE IN CALIFORNIA FOR- YOU AYE FRAUD. HAVE BEEN THROUGH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES LOCAL POLICE AND SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CORRECT. IT'S CORRECT WE DO WORK WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- IT'S JUST A QUESTION TO- DIRECTOR FOR AREA SIR I'M GONNA SNEEZE. OKAY MAYBE NOT. IT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE MADE- GREAT PROGRESS ON THE BACKLOG SO THAT'S WONDERFUL CAN YOU JUST WALK US THROUGH- AS SORT OF- WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT TO. I'M I'M GOING TO DEFER TO GRESTY ON SOME OF THOSE BUT I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE- THE BACKLOG THAT WE SAW. YOU KNOW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WAS OBVIOUSLY DUE TO THE HUGE SPIKE IN- CLAIMS AND OF COURSE THE NEW CORPORATE THE NEW- FEDERAL PROGRAMS. AND WITHOUT THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS YOU KNOW THAT NUMBER OBVIOUSLY IT GOES DOWN SO- THERE'S ALSO AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING- THE I. T. DIVISION AT U. D. D. STOOD UP OVER TWO HUNDRED. I. T. PROJECTS THAT HELPED CLAIMANTS GET PAID FASTER YOU KNOW AS WE GO THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND WE- YOU KNOW LOOK AT LESSONS LEARNED WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WENT RIGHT WHAT WENT WRONG AND WE'RE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT- YOU KNOW WE DO. I WOULD SAY IT'S A IT'S A- IT'S A CANCELLATION OF. ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS WORKING TOGETHER. YOU KNOW US BOUNCING IDEAS OFF OF OFF OF WHAT YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS IN OUR I. T. BRANCH YOU KNOW REALLY. BUSTIN OUT TWO HUNDRED- I. T. PROJECTS TO HELP THE CLAIMANTS FASTER. GUNS THAT BELONGED TO MY NEXT QUESTION YOU SORT OF A LITTLE TOO SO WHAT WERE YOUR LESSONS LEARNED TO THIS POINT I KNOW YOU'RE STILL. IN THE PROCESS OF- FINALIZING YOUR REPORT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT THE RECESSION PLAN WILL BE IS WAS I OPENING TO ME- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO HIT IT AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE WITH THE- BEING ABLE TO PICK IT QUICKLY. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LESSON THAT WE LEARNED AND WE COULDN'T HAVE IT QUICKLY BACK WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED- I THINK YOU KNOW WITH THE I. T. SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND THE I. T. SYSTEM THAT WE WILL HAVE. I THINK THAT THAT WILL BE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN BEING ABLE TO PAY THAT- YOU KNOW WE WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON GUIDANCE I MEAN WE'RE NOT WORK WE ARE NOT ALL WE CAN'T ALWAYS MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE IS FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT- YOU KNOW THE RECESSION PLAN IS SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE GONNA USE AS OUR GUIDE AND BIBLE YOU KNOW FOR THE NEXT RECESSION. IT IS A SEPARATE FROM I. T. WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU SAY- DISORGANIZATION LEE HE HAS HAVE YOU CHANGED TO HELP YOU. PEOPLE TO PEOPLE MORE NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE. I THINK SOME OF OUR POLICIES SOME OF OUR INTERNAL POLICIES I MEAN WE'RE DEAL WELL DOES GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF THE WAY SO TO SPEAK YOU KNOW AND LIKE THE OVERPAYMENT AREA AND SOME WAIVERS YOU KNOW I MEAN WHEN WE CAN DO THAT. AND WE CAN DO THAT AND WE CAN AUTOMATE THAT THEN THAT HELPS TO SPEED UP EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN IN A NUTSHELL I WOULD SAY THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE HAVE DONE I MEAN WE ARE VERY YOU KNOW WE ARE CLAIMANT FOCUSED AT EDT AND WE ARE- ALWAYS WILLING TO- LOOK AT THINGS A DIFFERENT WAY- AND SO I THINK THAT THAT HAS HELPED US OR THE TEAM. YOU KNOW IS RELATIVELY NEW OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I THINK THAT ON THAT HAS BEEN SUPER HELPFUL AS WELL. LOOKING AT THINGS A DIFFERENT WAY. GREAT AND THEN GO BACK TO FRAUD ON A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. COVER THIS AREA- IN TERMS OF. FRAUD MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE LARGE BALK OF THE FRAUD WAS INTHE- IN THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS AT THE PEW A PROGRAM AND I. AM LOOKING ON THE OTHER ACKERMAN. THE MY UNDERSTANDING IT WAS- I DON'T KNOW THE PERCENTAGE BUT- WAS A AREAS. 97% YEAH. SO IS YOUR- AT YOUR NEXT AND I SENSED- FOR PROPER NONDESCRIPT ASSISTANT BY MY COLLEAGUES- BUT IS YOUR- THE WAY YOU'RE SETTING UP YOUR ORGANIZATION IS THE IS THE MINDSET. WELL THE ROAD THERE WASN'T AS MUCH FRONT IN THE TRADITIONAL YOU ARE PROGRAM. SO THEREFORE YOU KNOW WE SET UP THIS UNITEL COMMITTEE- WITH. TRADITIONAL YOU ARE. FRAUD BUT- I GUESS WHAT WE YOU DO. IF YOU HAD- IMPLEMENT ANOTHER KIND OF FEDERAL PROGRAM- YOU KNOW VERY VERY QUICKLY I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE WORTH A WORTH A LARGE BLOCK OF THE FRAUD OCCURRED. SO THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT QUESTION AND YOU KNOW I MEAN AGAIN AND- I KNOW THAT I DO NEED YOU KNOW WAS THE TOPIC- YOU KNOW OF THE BEGINNING OF THAT THE HEARING. AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AS FAR AS- FRAUD DETECTION GOES- I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW TO THE L. A.'S ELLIE OWES POINTS ABOUT THE FRAUD CULTURE AND SORT OF THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE- RUNNING COUNTER TO WHAT THE STRIKE TEAM SAID. I MEAN I THINK I RE READ THE THIRD STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATION OVER THE WEEKEND IT ACTUALLY DROPPED FOUR DAYS BEFORE I STARTED AYE DVD- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT PART OF IT IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE RIGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WORKERS THAT YOU THE AND THE MANUAL PROCESS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS CULTURE FRAUD. YOU KNOW WHICH I WHICH I IMAGINE IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY SUGGESTED THAT WE USE A VENDOR YOU KNOW THAT MET THE FEDERAL STANDARD- IT TAKES THE MANUAL PROCESS OUT OF IT AND IT'S SORT OF ELIMINATES THE FRONT CULTURE. I MEAN INTO YOUR QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW WE ARE I THINK WE'RE UNDER ESTIMATING. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON YOU KNOW REGARDING THE IDENTITY THEFT THAT WENT ON AND. QUITE FRANKLY CONTINUES TO GO ON. ALTHOUGH EVERY PERSON I KNOW HAS HAD SORT OF SCAM STEPS. TO THEM DURING THE PANDEMIC EDT ARE NOT YOU KNOW OR KNEW SOMEONE THAT DID. AND I THINK THAT SAYING THAT THE FRONT IS OVER NOW THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE. ANY A FEDERAL PROGRAM LIKE POOL I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS YOU KNOW- I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE- WE ARE PRIORITIZING FRAUD AT THE EXPENSE OF. PROMPT AND STRAIGHT FORWARD PAYMENTS I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WE WOULD SAY IT'S THE OPPOSITE WE WOULD SAY THE LESS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT THAT OCCURS. ON THE FRONT END THE QUICKER WE CAN GET. YOU KNOW PEOPLE KATE- YOU KNOW SO I THINK THAT IT'S YOU KNOW WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT AGAIN I WOULD IMAGINE IF WE HAD ANOTHER FEDERAL. PROGRAM ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE LESSONS LEARNED AND I'M CERTAIN THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES AS WELL BECAUSE THEY ALSO. CHANGED SOME OF THEIR- GUIDANCE AS YOU KNOW WE JUST TALKED ABOUT SEIZE JUST YOU KNOW OF A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT IN THE FIRST PROGRAM BUT WAS IN THE SECOND PROGRAM YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO SUBSTANTIATE- EUROPOL EMPLOYMENT YOU KNOW FOR FEDERAL BENEFITS STONE. I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK WE COULD PICK IT I THINK I THINK THAT THAT'S NOW THERE'S THE TECHNOLOGY IS OUT THERE AND ORDERED AND WE CAN GET IT. IF WE NEED TO. WE JUST PIGGY BACKING OFF THE QUESTIONS FROM TO MY COLLEAGUES EARLIER. THEN DO YOU HAVE. THE PROPER STAFFING TO DO WITH- POTENTIAL FRAUDULENT CLAIMS- AS YOU DESCRIBE THIS IS- IDENTITY THEFT IS BECOMING MORE MORE PREVALENT NOT LAST. SO THE QUESTION IS THAT IS YOUR- IS YOUR STAFFING ADEQUATE FOR THE MOMENT ADDITIONAL STAFFING ADEQUATE FOR THE FUTURE. SO I WOULD SAY YES TO THAT AND I WOULD I WOULD SAY WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY- YOU KNOW IS TO TALK ABOUT THAT THE PC PIECE THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY INSTRUMENTAL YOU KNOW I THINK ME IS ON THE FRONT END. ALSO THE BACK AND TOM SOME WRITERS ON THE FRONT END ALSO ON THE BACK AND WHEN I SAY THAT I NEED ON THE FRONT END THEY PREVENT FRAUD FROM OCCURRING YOU KNOW AND THEN ON THE BACK AND THEY ACTUALLY HELP WITH THE ANALYSIS THE FRAUD ANALYTICS THAT I TALKED ABOUT THAT- MCGREGOR IS WORKING ON- WITH ACCENTURE AS WELL- YOU KNOW TO HELP US PARTS THROUGH. THE DATA SO THOSE ARE IT. YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE'RE USING NOW AND THERE ARE TOOLS YOU KNOW WE THEY THEY ARE OUR CONTRACTOR AND WE CAN USE THEM AS NEEDED AND AS THE SITUATION DICTATES. GOTTA BE JUST BASED ON THE BCPS YOU SUBMIT IT LOOKS LIKE. YOU YOUR DEPARTMENTS LOOKING AT. I. TS FOR CARE I MEAN JUST BASED ON. WHAT YOU'RE SUBMITTED DOLLARS. YES I'M SURE THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT. I MEAN I THINK IS A BIG COMPONENT BECAUSE WE WANT TO AUTOMATE. YOU KNOW GETTING PEOPLE PAID AND THAT OBVIOUSLY AUTOMATION MEANS FASTER. AND I GUESS THE CONCERN I JUST IN MY CONCERN I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU I THINK I T. IS A IS A HUGE ANSWER HARM IT'S JUST THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE OR EVEN THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO- PULL OFF THE- THE I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED WE KNOW IT NEEDS OF THE STATE JUST HAS A POOR TRACK RECORD IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO. UPGRADE ITS IT SYSTEM SO COULD YOU. COULD YOU THINK WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF HELP- WITH CDT. AND ARE THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THAT IF WE WERE YOU KNOW WORKING TOGETHER I THINK THAT. WE CAN DEFINITELY HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. IN. THANK YOU- MISTER TANK MISTER NAZARIAN TO HAVE COMMON. I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO MAYBE I'LL WAIT UNTIL THE SPECIFIC ISSUES ARE BEING BROUGHT UP- I CAN START NOW AS WELL IF YOU'D LIKE WHICH SPECIFIC ISSUES. I WON I HAD SOME. WELL FIRST SO FOR ITEM NUMBER ONE FUNDED PCPS- BUT ALSO ON JUST SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS ON THE APPEAL WAY DOCUMENTATION AND- AND- CONSTITUENT BASED ISSUES. OF PROCESS IF IT'S RELATED TO ISSUE ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. IF YOU NEED A COUPLE MOMENTS- LET ME JUST SAY ONE THING PLEASE RELATED TO THE B. ISSUE OF FRAUD- TECHNOLOGY IS SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A FLYER MADE OUT OF PAPER LEFTON SOMEONE'S CAR AND I'LL GIVE A VERY BRIEF EXAMPLE AND MY DISTRICT IN THE OMMUNITY OF THESE LOS ANGELES WHICH IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS. BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE AND HAS BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY MICHAEL THAT THE PANDEMIC AND AS WELL AS UNDER COUNT FOR THE CENSUS ALL OF WHICH IS RELATED- SEVERAL CONSTITUENTS CALLED MY OFFICE BECAUSE THEY HAD RECEIVED A FLYER ON THEIR CAR. SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED TO CONTACT. SOMEONE WHO THEY COULD PAY TO RUN THEIR EDT QUESTIONS. AT WHICH OF COURSE CREATE AND IT WAS A FLYER IN SPANISH WHICH WE HAVE A COPY OF. AND SO I BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION A DIRECTOR FARIAS BECAUSE MANY COMMUNITIES IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES LACK OF ACCESS AS I MENTIONED LANGUAGE BARRIERS. IT'S VERY EASY TO BE IN A POSITION OF I NEED HELP AND SO I'M GOING TO PAY THIS PERSON TO HELP ME WITH EDT. NOT KNOWING THAT THEY ARE- AND THEN ENDANGERING THEIR OWN PRIVACY. AND POSSIBLY. EVEN PUTTING THEMSELVES IN A POSITION OF FRAUD WHICH WE HAVE SEEN AND SO. UP THE ABILITY FOR US IN OUR IN OUR DISTRICT OFFIE TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AMID A PANDEMIC. THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE CHARGING YOU TO FILE YOUR EDT CLAIMS- AND THAT OUR OFFICES ARE THERE TO HELP WAS PART OF A LARGE. OUTRAGE THAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES SO THAT THEY ARE ALSO HELPED AND SECURE AND I KNOW THAT. WHICH ACCESS HAS BEEN A PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND SO WHILE WE WORK ON HIGHER END TECHNOLOGY SMARTPHONES ID ME ALL OF THOSE THINGS. ON THE GROUND EVERY DAY PEOPLE JUST SIMPLY NEED HELP AND IF SOMEONE WERE TO SAY HERE I'LL PAY YOU TO OR PAY ME TO FILE YOUR EDT CLAIM. WHILE YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO. YOU KNOW PAY THE BILLS AND FIND A JOB AND- ALSO YOU KNOW HAVE KIDS AT HOME WHO ARE STUDYING. AT HOME AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE SAW HIM AT THE PANDEMIC. THESE ARE ALL JUST EVERYDAY THINGS THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AND SO I HOPE THAT'S ON YOUR RADAR AS WELL JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT THAT SOMETHING AS SIMPLE A A FLYER ON A PAPER ON YOUR CAR. WINDSHIELD CAN CREATE A LOT OF. A PROBLEMS LOCALLY FOR A FAMILY. MISTER THIRTY PRE. THANK YOU MANAGER DIRECTOR VARIOUS NICE TO SEE YOU NOT NOT SURE IF I SHOULD CONGRATULATE YOU OR OR- JUST WISH YOU BEST SUCCESS AS AS YOU ARE MAKING YOUR EFFORTS GOING THROUGH ALL OF THIS PROCESS BUT- NONETHELESS GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN AND I APPRECIATE THE CONSISTENCY THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED- OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THE YEAR AT LEAST- FIRST I WANT TO START BY. ASKING SOMETHING ABOUT SOME OF THE BCPS THAT ARE INCLUDED- AND YOU KNOW. THE IDEA AROUND THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS BUYING POWER WAS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ENTERED. INTO AN ENTERPRISE CONTRACT- WITH MICROSOFT FOR OFFICETHREE SIXTY FIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OUR BUYING POWER WAS SUPPOSED TO- TRANSLATE TO COST SAVINGS. SO AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE BCPS NOW FOR DEPARTMENTS TO PAY FOR THEIR MICROSOFT THREE SIXTY FIVE AND THESE BCPS NOTE THAT. THEY ARE TO COVER THE INCREASED COST OF MOVING TO A STATE BY CONTRACT FOR MICROSOFT AND USER LICENSING AGREEMENT. SO ONE- DID THE ENTERPRISE CONTRACT NOT TRANSLATE TO COST SAVINGS BUT ACTUALLY TO INCREASE COSTS. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO DEFERRED TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT QUESTION. BUT AFTERNOON I READ I GOT ET US DEFENSE FOR MAKING OFFICER SO BEFORE. CURRENTLY ET DE MICROSOFT LICESING IS BASED ON A PER USAGE- FIVE INSTEAD OF AN ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT AND SO- PDD LAST- UPGRADED THEIR SOFTWARE WAY BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I BELIEVE ARE TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN I WENT WHEN THERE WAS FUNDING AVAILABLE SO THERE WAS NOT A CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR MICROSOFT LICENSING THE REASON FOR THE REQUEST IS NOW. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CONTINUOUS- SUBSCRIPTION LICENSES FOR OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE. RIGHT BUT BUT AGAIN THE QUESTION IS THAT IT WAS MANT TO. BRING ABOUT COST SAVINGS- BUT BUT BUT THIS IS THIS IS INCREASING I UNDERSTAND THE NUMBER OF USERS THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT WILL BE DOING BUSINESS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY. AND ITS ADVANTAGES TO ANYONE WHO IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE IN A POSITION. TO RECEIVE THE ENTIRETY OF THE BUSINESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE INSURING THAT WE'RE PROTECTING THE STATE'S. ASSETS BY NEGOTIATING THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE FOR US. SO YEAH THERE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A COST SAVINGS IF YOU COULD WORTH INTO AN ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT BEFORE COMING INTO YOU THINK THAT THE TDP'S CONTRACT- THE REASON WHY WE DON'T HAVE A COST SAVINGS BECAUSE HE WAS NEVER IN AN ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT YOU WITH WHEN. THERE WAS MONEY AVAILABLE AND WE BY THE LICENSE DENNIS AT THAT TIME WHICH WAS AVAILABLE FOR UP WHAT ENTERPRISE UP THIRTY FEET LICENSING WITH AVAILABLE WAY BACK WHICH IS CURRENTLY NOT NOT AVAILABLE FOR OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE. SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE DOES NOT HAVE A COST SAVINGS JUST BECAUSE OUR MODEL WITH DIFFERENT COMPARED TO THE MODEL TODAY SO THEN DOESN'T THIS REQUIRE OR ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. REVISIT AND OPEN IT UP. TO SEE WHAT OTHER PROPOSALS THAT MEET THEIR MAYBE. WHY NOT WHY NOW GO FORWARD WITH- WITH INCURRING A GREATER AMOUNT OF COST. BUT INSTEAD SEE WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS SPECIALLY GIVEN HOW MUCH TECHNOLOGY FLOOD CHANGES. IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WHY NOT NOW OPEN IT UP AGAIN. SO WE ARE YOU THINK TICKET OF POP UP. THAT WOULD SET UP. RECENTLY OF TO FILL DIDN'T DO THE- AT ECONOMICS OF SCALE SO THAT IS THE BEST AFTER ABOUT- OF- COSTING RIGHT NOW FOR THE STATE. I'M SORRY YOUR WINNER SAYING KATAKANA MEANS OF SCALE. WE'RE PAYING MORE. AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE ARGUMENT IF WE'RE GOING TO UTILIZE ECONOMIES OF SCALE CAR ADVANTAGE. WE SHOULDN'T. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE SHOULD BE PAYING MORE RIGHT NOW- GIVEN. GIVEN THE SERVICES. THAT WE'RE EXPECTING. EIGHT EIGHT THE CARD PROPER OFFICE TO FIFTY FIVE WAS THAT LET DOWN BY- T. P. AT THE POINT OF TECHNOLOGY SO I DON'T HAVE ANY INSIGHT. ON HOW THEY PREPARED THAT THAT'S THAT THE LICENSES I WOULD YES AVAILING ITS RECEIPT HE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST YOU DEFEAT OKAY IS SOMEONE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF. TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ON THE PANEL. THERE'S SOMEONE ON THE CALL. NOW NO ONE'S EVER KNOWN FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EXTENT TECHNOLOGIES CURRENTLY REPRESENTED BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE BACK ANY QUESTIONS. YEAH BUT I'M I'M SOMEWHAT SURPRISED THAT THIS-ANSWERED THIS QUESTION ISN'T BEING ANSWERED. AND THERE'S NO ONE ON THE PANEL THAT CAN ANSWER IT. SHOULDN'T WE BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION. WE WILL GO BACK TO CDT AND GET YOU AN ANSWER. OKAY SO DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH MORE A CDC R. E. D. D. F. TV IS GOING TO PAY FOR MICROSOFT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND OUTGOING AND OUTGOING YEARS AS WELL- COMPARED TO WHAT THEY'VE PAID IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. R. ET DE I COULD I COULD ONLY FIT FOR EASY- FOR YOU DID YOU WE DID NOT PAY ANY LICENSING PARKED UP FOR MICROSOFT- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YES BECAUSE OUR LICENSING IS IT OLD WORST FEELING OFFICE TWENTY THIRTEEN WE HAVEN'T UPGRADED TO OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE. OF THE LAST TIME WE PURCHASE I BELIEVE IT'S IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OR TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I WAS ABLE A ONE TIME- UP FEET INSTEAD OF A SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE LIKE WHAT WERE USED IMPROPERLY FIFTY FIVE. SO WHAT IS THE UPGRADE GONNA COST US. THE DIFFERENT. THE TRANSITION TO OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE. OH I'M SORRY WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PAID FOR OFFICE A LICENSE IT'S UP OVER SIXTY YEARS SO WE HAVE BEEN ON ON A DIFFERENT LICENSING ABOUT- MODOC COMPARED TO OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE YOU. THAT'S THAT OUR PUBLIC I THINK THAT THAT THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUDGET FOR OFFICE TO SUPPORT ANY UPGRADE ON ON OUR MICROSOFT LICENSES. SINCE THE LAST SIX YEARS. OKAY THIS IS IT THIS IS A NEW PURCHASE FOR EACH DIFFERENT POSITION FROM OFFICE. TWENTY THIRTEEN TO OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE. OKAY THIS IS JUST RISING UP THIS IS JUST RAISING MORE QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT AND I APOLOGIZE MADAM CHAIR I DON'T WANNA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE COMMITTEES TIME RIGHT NOW BUT I STILL HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T MIND- THE LET ME. ASK HOW MUCH DO ALL CALIFORNIA STATE DEPARTMENTS IN TOTAL PAY EACH YEAR. FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE. MISTER NAZARIAN EFFORT RELATED SOLELY ON EDT THEY WOULDN'T KNOW HOW OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE WITH- ANY UPGRADES TO THE MICROSOFT OF THE SUCCESSFUL THERE IF WE CAN TRY TO KEEP IT FOCUSED PLAY THAT'S FAIR THAT'S FAIR- WELL LET'S LET'S LET'S ANSWER THAT QUESTION JUST FOR EDT. WHAT IF BUT FOR TRANSITIONING OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE IS AROUND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE TRANSITION FROM UPGRADING FROM OFFICE TWENTY THIRTEEN TO OFFICE WILL GET THE PROJECT AN ONGOING SUBSCRIPTION SUPPORT FOR TEN THOUSAND USERS. FOR TEN THOUSAND USERS. AND IT'S GOING TO BE FIVE MILLION A YEAR ON GOING OR IS IT GOING TO BE MORE THAN FIVE MILLION. THAT WILL BE- ABOUT FIVE MILLION A YEAR ON GOING AND I ARE WRITING AND- BASED ON CD CASE CONTRACT I BELIEVE THERE IS SOME INCREASE AFTER UP A COUPLE YEARS BUT I'M NOT. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION WITH ME WHICH I CAN PROVIDE- LATER AND THIS IS JUST FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION SO IF THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES BEING ASKED FOR. THEN IT'S GONNA BE CONSIDERABLY RISING AND COST AS WELL. AND IS THERE A CAP. THAT THAT DOESN'T APPEAR IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE IT'S NOT JUST OPPORTUNITY THIS WEEK OF OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE INCLUDING YOU KNOW THE OFFICE PRODUCTS WORD EXCEL MICROSOFT INCLUDING KEY IN SHAREPOINT- IT ALSO INCLUDES A SOME SECURITIES OUT THERE IN YOU BEGIN MICROSOFT SO THERE IS IT IS DEFINITELY A PRODUCT AND GETS NOT. ONE SINGLE PLATFORM. ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT IS OUTSIDE OF THE SWEET SWEET COULD POP BUT THAT'LL BE A CUT BUT FOR NOW. THE WHOLE ENTIRE SUITE IS THAT INCLUDED IN IN THAT THOSE LICENSING. OKAY AND WHAT'S THE CAP OF A COST FOR A PER YEAR. AND THE CONTRACT. I DO NOT HAVE ALL THE DETAILS WE CAN PROVIDE- AND SHARED A CONTRACT THAT IS- THE EDT KATHLEEN TVP- PARTS OF THE DETAILS. OKAY THANK YOU- AND INNOCENT AFARIA AND FOR PURPOSE OF CLARITY AS TO THE WHAT EDT HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS WAS A NON DISCUSSION ITEM ON PAGE THREE OF THE AGENDA WHICH ACTUALLY HAS THE BREAKDOWN BETWEEN. THE GENERAL FUND AS WELL AS EDT FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE ASKING. I SAW THAT BUT I COULDN'T GET ALL OF MY ANSWERS SO THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO. DRILL IN A LITTLE BIT MORE THANK YOU MANAGER IF YOU DON'T MIND I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ALSO. BASED ON MY CONSTITUENT ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN COMING THROUGH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK ON THIS IF YOU WANT ME TO KEEP IT FOR ANOTHER TIME OF COURSE THE SENATE THERE AND JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT WE DO HAVE OTHER PANELISTS WAITING TO PRECIADO I MEAN I. THIS IS ONGOING SO I CAN KEEP THIS FOR THE NEXT PANEL- BECAUSE IT'S A CAKE I THINK IT'S A CUTS THROUGH SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES BUT- I JUST WANTED TO ASK. I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS. I'LL JUST LIMITED TO FOR NOW- TOOK FOR ON ON THE INTERVIEW WAIT TIMES. OF AND AGAIN I CAN ASK THIS LATER IF YOU LIKE. I OR I CAN PROCEED RIGHT NOW. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS KEEP IT BRIEF AND KEEP IT MOVING THANK CHAU STILL IT'S STILL TAKING EDT AT LEAST TWO TO FIVE MONTHS TO CONDUCT INTERVIEWS- WHY THIS DEGREE OF WAIT TIME SOLELY INTO THIS PROCESS. SO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WERE HERE FOR MIGHT MY INTRO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I WILL- ALLOW COLLEAGUES TO- AT ANYTHING IF NEEDED BUT WE ARE- LOOKING AT IN THE PROCESS OF. DOING A WRITTEN INTERVIEW SO THAT WILL GO OUT QUESTOR BRITAIN QUESTIONNAIRE AND THAT WILL GO OUT TO- PLACEMENTS THAT ARE WAITING FOR DETERMINATION AND THAT WAY THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THAT THAT AMOUNT OF TIME. WE ALL HAVE SAID IN PAST HEARINGS THAT THE WAIT TIME IS UNACCEPTABLE IT'S A BACKLOG THAT WE HAVE IT'S A BACKLOG THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE VENDOR THAT CAME IN- LAST LAST YEAR THAT'S HELPING US THROUGH SOME OF THAT SO AND WE'RE HOPEFUL HOPEFUL THAT THE QUESTIONNAIRE- WILL BE THE- THE THING THAT EXPEDITES THIS THE MOST. OKAY. SO ON DOCUMENTATION SPECIFICALLY ON Q. A- DOCUMENTATION WHAT WE HEAR IS THAT THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL CONFUSION ABOUT WHO AND WHY PEOPLE ARE GETTING DISQUALIFIED ONCE THEY'VE ALREADY SUBMITTED DOCUMENTATION. AND WHO WOULD THEN- WITH THE APPEAL- DOES THIS EDT PROVIDE THEIR DECISION MAKERS WITH VERY CLEAR AND CONCISE CRITERIA. FOR WHO IS APPROVED AND WHO. IS DISQUALIFIED. OR WHO TO DISQUALIFY. I CAN CERTAINLY TAKE THAT ONE DIRECTOR SERVICE IF YOU'D LIKE- SO THAT'S YEAH WITH EDT- YEAH SO SPECIFIC TO THE NOTIFICATIONS AND WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR CONSTITUENTS- WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PHASE THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY IN RIGHT NOW WE SEND THE CONSTITUENCY THE LINK THAT I REFERENCED PREVIOUSLY- AND IT DOES BREAK DOWN IT IS VALUABLE TO THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEREFORE DEPENDING UPON THE YEAR IN WHICH THEY SAID THEIR APPLICATIONS FOR BENEFITS THE YEAR PRIOR TO AND UP UNTIL THE DATE IN WHICH THEY BEGAN THEIR BENEFIT YEAR FOR BENEFITS. THERE IS A TIME HEARD IN WHICH DOCUMENTATION MUST BE PROVIDED IT DOES NOT HAVE TO COVER THE ENTIRE DURATION IT JUST NEEDS TO COVER EIGHT ANYTIME BETWEEN THAT POINT IN TIME AND SO ON THE CLICK. IN THE LINK AS THEY'RE NAVIGATING THE CONSTITUENTS THROUGH WHAT THE DOCUMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHAT WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE THAT THEY CAN PULL FROM TAX DOCUMENTS SCHEDULE SEES- JOB OFFERS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY EMPLOYERS THERE'S A LIST OF DOCUMENTS THAT THE CONSTITUENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH US TO RUN IT WALKING BURKE FLOWING THROUGH THE PROCESS WE HAVE ALSO ACTUALLY EXPANDED OUR PUBLIC FACING WEBSITE TO ENSURE THAT WE ENHANCE THE NOTIFICATIONS OF DOCUMENTS BUT- GIVEN AT CONSTITUENTS CAN PULL FROM. IN ORDER TO UPLOAD THEM AND PROVIDE THEM TO US IN THE EVENT THAT THEY'RE DISQUALIFIED WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OUR INSTANCES OF- DOCUMENTS THAT ARE TOO FAR OUT- WHERE THEY MAY FALL INTO A COMPLETELY DID YEARS PAST THAT AREN'T SUITABLE OR ACCEPTABLE GIVEN THE TIME PERIOD THAT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE DOCUMENTS FOR AND SO WITHOUT THOUGH WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR PROCESSES IN OUR OPERATIONS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAM A PRESENTED IS TO REACH OUT IN THE EVENT THAT IT SOMETHING AT THAT COULD EITHER BE CLARIFIED OVER THE PHONE- OR THAT WE CAN PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL LINK IF THAT'S THE SITUATION IN WHICH WE- CAN PROVIDE. A NEW DOCUMENT. BUT IT'S- THEY DO HAVE THEIR THEIR APPEAL RIGHTS AND WE WEEK. ONE WHEN THE CONCERT SOME THOSE BACK AND THE APPEAL- WE ASK PERFORM ANOTHER PER APPEAL REVIEW. THAT'S ACTUALLY TRANSMITTED TO THE CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PPEALS BOARD. OKAY SO I APPRECIATE THE SENSOR BUT JUST TO BE VERY SPECIFIC WHAT. WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU PROVIDE WHEN AN APPEAL IS NECESSARY YOU SAID YOU. OFFER A LIST OF DOCUMENTS BUT CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC AYE AYES TO. HOW DO YOU ARM THE PERSON WITH INFORMATION SO THAT THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO AS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. WHAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. YES AND SO- WITH RESPECT TO THE- WHAT WE'VE DONE IS EXPANDED THAT LIST OF DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD. THAT A CLAIM I CAN ACTUALLY. PULL FROM- THE EASIEST THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE QUICKEST THAT WE'VE SEEN SPECIALLY FOR- ELECTRONIC TAX FILERS GUESTS ARE TAX DOCUMENTS. AND SO WE'VE ACTUALLY- INSURE THAT WE'VE EXPANDED THE DOCUMENT SO THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF WHAT IS SUITABLE. AND FALLS INTO THEIR SPECIFIC CRITERIA AS FAR AS THE TIME FRAME. SO THEY'RE PROVIDED WITH A LIST OF ACCEPTABLE DOCUMENTS THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE. IF BY CHANCE LIKE I MENTIONED THEY PROVIDE OF A YEAR THAT'S NOT EVEN WITHIN THE PARAMETER IN WHICH THEY'VE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE- THAT IS ONE WORTH NOTICING OF THEM OF THE DISQUALIFICATION. ADWORDS REQUIRED TO BUY TO ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND THEN ADVISE THEM OF THEIR PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. WE THERE'S THAT INTRO WHERE- SAYING AT THE GIVE A PERFECT EXAMPLE AS FAR AS IF THE KIND OF BY ANY CHANCE PROVIDES DOCUMENTATION THAT SPEAKS TO. A YEAR THAT FALLS. THAT OVERLAPS- AND IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR THAT THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY COVERS THE TIME FRAME WE HAVE INSTRUCTED OUR PROGRAM UPS TO CONTACT THEM AND CALL THEM TO CLARIFY THAT- AND REQUEST ITSELF ANTICIPATION TO VERIFY THAT WE JUST WERE EARNED. DURING THE TIME PERIOD AND THEN WE CAN CLOSE AND SO WE'VE- INDICATED A FEW AVENUES. THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE CLAIMANT PRIOR TO AN UP UNTIL THEIR DISQUALIFICATION TO WHICH THE ONLY AVENUE AFTER THAT AS IN A PEOPLE. OKAY. OKAY I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY MISADVENTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. THE YOU I TRUST FUND REPAYMENT WE WILL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE- KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF AND TO THE POINT SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ON WITH THE COMBINED PANEL WHICH FOLLOWS AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY OF OUR PRESENTERS. THANK YOU. THE PART OF FINANCE. THE CHECKER PATTERN TOP AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE PROPOSAL IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH THE THEME OF RAISING LIABILITIES THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OPTIMIZATION PROPOSING THREE BILLION DOLLARS- GENERAL FUND ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWO BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. TO PAY DOWN THE U. I TRUST FUND LOAN THAT WAS TAKEN OUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PAY YOU AYE BENEFITS UNINTERRUPTED WHEN THE PHONE WENT INSOLVENT IN TWENTY TWENTY SO REDUCE THE STATE'S LIABILITIES ACCELERATE THE REPAYMENT OF THIS DEBT WHICH IS CURRENTLY NINETEEN POINT FIVE BILLION. EVERY TECHNICAL. AND HE TECHNICAL SUPPORT THANK. THANK YOU AND NOW THE L. L. CHAZELLE LOW WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE ALSO- LAST WEEK PUBLISHED REPORT ON ON THIS PROPOSAL BY WHICH THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO MAKE TWO PAYMENTS TOTALING THREE BILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS THAT OUTSTANDING FEDERAL LOANS. DOZENS ARE ALL RIGHT MODELS A COUPLE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS- ANTICIPATING HOW- ARE THE STATE AND EMPLOYERS WILL REPAY OF THE FEDERAL LOANS- WE ESTIMATE THAT THE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED PAYMENT WOULD REDUCE STATE INTEREST COSTS. ARE BY A TOTAL OF BETWEEN FIVE AND FIFTY MILLION AND ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS- THAT RANGE- IS INDICATIVE OF THE TWO SCENARIOS SOMETHING LOW COST AND HIGH COSTS IN ORDER WITH THAT THAT OUR OFFICE- PUT FORTH. ON WE ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED PAYMENTS COULD REDUCE- LAWYER YOU I PAY WHAT TAXES AT THE END OF THE REPAIR. WHICH WE ESTIMATE TO BE EITHER TWENTY THIRTY OR TWENTY THIRTY TWO- THAT THE PARENTS OPERATE MUCH LIKE A LUMP SUM PAYMENT ON A MORTGAGE- THEY THEY WOULDN'T REDUCE OUR COSTS FOR ANNUAL PAYMENTS BUT IT WOULD REDUCE THE DURATION OF A LOTS OF THOSE. PRIMARY DIRECT BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYERS IN TERMS OF TAX RELIEF- WOULD NOT OCCUR UNTIL THE END OF THE REPAYMENT PERIOD- WE PROPOSE AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IT SHOULD IT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE MORE IMMEDIATE TAX RELIEF IT COULD LOOK TO PROVIDING A- YOU AYE TAX CREDIT TO EMPLOYERS- TO OFFSET THE- INCREASED FEDERAL TAXES SCHEDULED TO GO INTO EFFECT THIS YEAR. HOW TO REPAY THE LOANS I'M THIS ALTERNATIVE WOULD PROVIDE MORE. IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO- BUSINESSES THAT THE- THAT THE FAX PANDEMIC ARE ARE. STE LINGER OKAY THANK YOU BEFORE OPEN IT UP TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT TO CALL. A MINUTE- THEY BOTH KINDA COINCIDE SO. DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE A PROJECTED DATE TO REPAY THE FEDERAL YOU AYE DADDY AND HOW WOULD THIS PROPOSAL REPAYMENT ASSIST BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYERS. JERA PATTERN TOP AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A PROJECTED DATE TO COMPLETE THE RENT PAYMENT OF THE U. EYES THAT JUST DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY THAT ANY PRODUCTION WOULD HAVE SINCE IT WILL DEPEND ON. THE STATE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U. I FIND AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC HEALTH OF THE STATE. AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY THAT'S ADDED REGARDING AN ADDITIONAL TRIGGER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL KNOWN AS THE BENEFIT COST RATIO THAT COULD COME INTO. PLAY AT YOUR FIVE INSOLVENCY- WHICH IF THE STATE DOES NOT OPT TO WAIVE THIS TRIGGER AND MEET THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS SURROUNDING IT. BUT XCELERATED THE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX ACT CREDIT REDUCTIONS. BECAUSE THE DEBTS BE PAID OFF MORE QUICKLY- AND ALTHOUGH. AGAIN AS A RESULT WE DON'T HAVE A CURRENT ESTIMATE- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE ARMENIAN RECESSION YOU I FIND THAT PEAKED AT AROUND ELEVEN BILLION. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHAT WAS THAT NOT REPAID UNTIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN BENEFIT. BUSINESSES WILL BENEFITS MOTHERS IS THE FUTURE BY ACCELERATING THE PAY OFF- WHICH WILL RESTORE THE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX ACT CREDIT BY UP TO A YEAR EARLIER- WHICH- WILL OF COURSE BE. WERE THE LARGEST CUMULATIVE IMPACT WILL BE THAT THE- FOOD THAT. TAX CREDIT REDUCTIONS ARE CUMULATIVE YEAR OVER YEAR. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS ON ISSUE TO.

BETTER TOPIC APARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BEYOND THOSE ARE MADE BY THE MINISTRATION THANK YOU. LOL. HELLO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE PROPOSALS BROAD TOUCHES MANY STATE DEPARTMENTS OUR OFFICE IS STILL WORKING ON ANALYSIS UP IN ITS ENTIRETY- BUT WE PUT IT IS THIS POINT THAT THE PACKAGES IS VERY CONCEPTUAL IN NATURE RIGHT NOW- GIVES THE LEGISLATURE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP SHAPE HOW IT LOOKS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AND SPECIFIC SO THE WORKFORCE PIECES- THAT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL WE DO POINT OUT THAT. BOTH ENTITIES HAVE. RECEIVE SUCH. FUNDING INCREASES OF CENTS A PANDEMIC BEGAN AND THIS WOULD BE ON TOP OF THOSE LEGISLATORS GONNA WANNA MAKE SURE AS A CONSIDERS THE PACKAGE IN ITS ENTIRETY. THAT BOTH THE BOARD AND THE PANEL HAVE THE RESOURCES- TO SCALE UP GRANT MAKING BUT ALSO THAT THE DEMAND- EXISTS IN THE FIELD- SO THAT. THE THESE PROGRAMS CAN EFFECTIVELY TARGET- THE WORK FORCE NEEDS- THAT THAT AIM TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK THAT YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR OUR FROM A LOT OF THE MEMBERS WHEN IT COMES TO CREATING JOB OPPORTUNITIES CREATING A- A PIPELINE FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND SO WHAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED A LIST OF JOBS IN SECTORS THAT WILL BE SUPPORTED THROUGH THESE PROPOSALS SUCH AS- ACUTE CARE TO SCHOOL- SKILLED NURSING HOMES OR SOCIAL WORK. WHAT FACTORS WERE CONSIDERED IN BUILDING THIS LIST AND WHAT JOBS OR SECTORS. WILL BE PRIORITIZE AND NIGHT I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT GIVEN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE SEEN HOW ESSENTIAL IN FRONT MY WORKERS IN THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSION. HAVE BEEN A COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED AS ESPECIALLY IN SKILLED NURSING HOME FACILITIES AND SO WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. HOW THIS LIST CAME ABOUT THANK YOU. I CAN. GIVE ME I CAN RESPOND- ONE WAY TO START WITH IS THAT THIS INVESTMENT WILL BUILD UPON THE LEGISLATURE'S INVESTMENT LAST YEAR IN LONG TERM CARE AND SIGNIFICANT- BUDGET ITEMS THAT WHEN PRIMARILY ON THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SIDE TO INCREASE TRAINING FOR IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES WORKERS AND CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS- IT HAS BEEN A THRILL AND AN HONOR TO WORK IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORK THAT WILL CONTINUE. AND TO- FACE ARE PROJECTIONS BY ON THE LABOR MARKET INFORMATION DIVISION- AND OTHER PROJECTIONS THAT- H. CAI FORMALLY- OUR STRIDE IS MAKING AS YOU SAW IN THE OVERALL CONDITION AND IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC- LINE ITEMS FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS FOR. NURSES FOR IN B. FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- AND SO I THINK BIG PART OF THE PLANNING. FOR THE- INITIALLY THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY OUR TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY WERE MARKET DEMAND IS GREATEST AND WHERE THE JOBS WILL OFFER THE BEST CAREER PATHWAYS FOR INDIVIDUALS FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND THOSE ARE LIKELY TO BE PATHWAYS- THAT THAT CAN DESCRIBE THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A FOUR YEAR DEGREE THAT COULD BE RESPIRATORY TACKY CAGEY TACKLED HER SOUND- AS WELL. AS- ESHEL ROLES IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENT WILL REALLY ENABLE CALIFORNIA TO STAFF UP TO FILL MUCH NEEDED ROLES AND AGAIN TO REALLY PROVIDE. PATHWAYS INTO GOOD JOBS FOR- MANY PEOPLE WHO LEFT OTHER ROLES IN THE- IN THE PANDEMIC AND CAN- FIND NEW ROLES AND HEALTH CARE. THANK YOU I KNOW THAT MANY YEARS AGO THERE WAS A SAYING OR- CALLED THE SILVER TSUNAMI IN WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND EVEN GRANDPARENTS OF THE SAME GENERATION ALL AGING OUT I'M SORRY THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE PHRASING ALL BECOMING A SENIORS OR ELDERLY ALL IN THE IN THE SAME CATEGORY SO THIS IS AN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. PIECE OF SOLVING THAT HEALTHCARE A NECESSITY FOR MANY COMMUNITIES I'LL JUST- ONE OPEN IT UP TO THE MEMBERS AS WELL BUT HOW MANY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKERS ARE PROJECTED TO BE TRAINED I HEARD I THINK TWENTY TWO THOUSAND WHEN IT WAS BEING PRESENTED. THROUGH THESE PROPOSALS WHAT METRICS WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE SUCCESS. I THINK PART OF DEVELOPING EACH OF THESE. GROSGRAIN COMPONENTS UNDER THE INITIATIVE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY THOSE SPECIFIC METRICS THOSE ARE LIKELY TO FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES METRICS MEASURING THE PROGRESS OF TRAINING PARTICIPANTS OF THE IMPACT ON PROVIDERS AND THEN THE IMPACT ON THAT PATIENTS AND CLIENTS- WHO ARE RECIPINTS OF SERVICES FOR TRAINING PARTICIPANTS THOSE METRICS ARE LIKELY TO FOCUS ON COMPLETION OF TRAINING. ATTAINMENT OF A DEGREE CERTIFICATE OR LICENSE JOB PLACEMENT WAGES AT THE POINT OF PLACEMENT AND AS THOSE- PEOPLE EVENTS IN THEIR JOBS AND WAGES THAT EXCEED INDIVIDUALS PRIOR EARNINGS AND OR MEET LOCAL- STANDARDS FOR SELF SUFFICIENCY WE WILL ALSO LOOK AT JOB RETENTION. AND CERTAINLY LOOK AT DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO- MEASURE PROGRESS ON EQUITY GOALS- IN DISAGGREGATED IN THOSE OTHER OUTCOMES. IN TERMS OF THE PROVIDER SIDE THE DEMAND SIDE WE WILL BE LOOKING AT METRICS THAT INCLUDE THE INCREASED DIVERSITY OF THE WORKFORCE REDUCE TIME TO HIRE REDUCED USE OF TEMPORARY STAFF AND SUCH AS TRAVELLING NURSES. AND INCREASED RETENTION AND REDUCE TURNOVER YOU KNOW PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY WILL BE THE IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE WILL LOOK AT PATIENT AND. CLIENT- RECIPIENT. AT TRICKS THAT WILLING POSITIVE REYES FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND QUALITY OF CARE IMPROVED ADHERENCE TO CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT. REDUCED EMERGENCY VISITS AND REDUCED RE HOSPITALIZATION RATES SO THAT'S REALLY OUT OF. WATER METRICS THAT WILL BE APPLIED DIFFERENTLY TO THE DIFFERENT PROGRAM COMPONENTS. THANK YOU- DEPUTY SECRETARIES NAY YOU BROUGHT UP ONE KEY WORDS THAT I ALWAYS- PICK UP ON AND THAT DIVERSITY I KNOW THAT PROP TO A NINE HAS OFTEN GOTTEN IN THE WAY OF US BEING ABLE TO COMPILE DATA AND RESOURCES RELATED TO THAT. AS IT IMPACTS COMMUNITIES LANGUAGE AXES ALL OF THE THINGS AND SO THAT WAS ACTUALLY A QUESTION THAT I HAD FOR YOU HOW WELL WE- ALWAYS TALK ABOUT EQUITY AND DIVERSITY IT'S OFTEN A CHALLENGE TO MEASURE. AND SO WHAT IS THE WHAT IS L. W. D. A.'S OUTREACH PLAN TO ENSURE THAT THIS EXPANSION OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WORKFORCE PIPELINE WILL BENEFIT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WELL THAT IS- AMONG THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES OF THIS WHOLE INITIATIVE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INCREASING LINGUISTICALLY AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT WORKERS FOR THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR- WHICH IMPROVES HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES. AND AGAIN CREATING NEW PATHWAYS INTO THESE GOOD JOBS FOR HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. AND AS YOU SUGGEST OUR REGION TO THESE COMMUNITIES WILL BE INTEGRAL TO THE SUCCESS. OF ALL THE TRADING COMPONENTS AND WILL BE BUILT INTO A TRAINING PROGRAM DESIGNED AND SOLICITATIONS. THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSE CONNECTIONS TO COMMUNITIES TO LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN REALLY TAP THAT ARE CLOSE AND TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE TARGET. COMMUNITIES AND THESE TARGET COMMUNITIES WILLINCLUDE IMMIGRANTS. REFUGEES PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE LANGUAGE SKILLS YOU'RE SITTING ON THE DELZ LOW WAGE WORKERS OF COLORS. COLOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FORMERLY HOMELESS JUSTICE INVOLVED. AND PEOPLE WITH OTHER LIVED EXPERIENCE THAT CAN BE AN ASSET. AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE SETTINGS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT I KNOW THAT- IN THE PAST HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE HAD WE'VE SPOKEN A LOT ABOUT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS ABILITY TO RECEIVE CARE- AND SOMETIMES THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE IN SILOS AND TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE PUTTING MONEY OR POTENTIALLY CREATING A PIPELINE AND PUTTING FUNDING. TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE LACK OF WORK FORCE AND THE LACK OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO DO THIS WORK. IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE THAT WE SHOULD BE HAVING AND SOMETHING BEFORE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO THANK YOU SO MUCH IF THERE ARE NO. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

AS WELL AS ORGANIZED LABOR SCHOOLS COLLEGES- LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS COMMITTEE BASED ORGAIZATIONS- FIFTEEN HUNDRED WILL BE TRAINED- WILL WORK WITH ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION WHICH IS REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT TO PLUG ORPHANED OIL AND GAS WELLS- SO WE'RE BUILDING IN. TO THE WORK OF DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY TRAIN PEOPLE FOR THE JOBS TO BE CREATED BY THAT DEMAND FOR THE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT I SHOULD SAY THAT THERE'S ALSO FEDERAL DOLLARS ARE BEING INVESTED THERE TOO THAT WILL CREATE- WHAT WE THINK IS SIGNIFICANT THE DEMAND FOR- FOR THESE WORKERS- WELL CAPPING MARC REQUIRED SKILLS THAT ARE COMMON. IN SEVERAL SEVERAL OF THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES AND ESPECIALLY THE OF THOSE ALIGNED WITH THE OIL AND GAS DRILLING DURING TENSION IS TO TRANSITION CURRENT WORKERS- AS WELL AS MOVE DISLOCATED WORKERS WHO WANT TO WORK IN OIL CAPPING- THE MOVE THEM NTO THE INTO THE PIPELINE FOR GOOD QUALITY JOBS. UP WITH UP. IN FIVE FOUR BUILDING ON IT D. A. S. APPROVED PROGRAMS THAT SERVE- KERN COUNTY- ARE HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CREWS PROGRAM WILL DO WILL BE ALIGNED TO HELP PROVIDE ACCESS POINTS- TO- TO THESE THESE JOBS AS WELL AS COORDINATION WITH- IT IS WORK FOR SERVICES BRANCH AS YOU JUST HEARD THAT THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THIS AT THIS PLACE TO OIL AND GAS WORKERS- SO AT. THE BUILDING ON THE DEMAND CREATED BY THE INVESTMENTS AND THE CREDIT PATHWAYS INTO THE JOBS FOR DISLOCATED WORKERS BUT ALSO THOSE WORKERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN THE INDUSTRY BUT WHAT. WHAT TRANSITION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M NOT SURE WHO I'M PIVOTING TO. THANK YOU MISS RAINY I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING BACK TO MR ROMERO FOR THE SIXTY MILLION FOR LOW CARBON ECONOMIC OR A COMIC GRANT PROGRAMS. THAT THAT WOULD BE MADE OUT OF CHAIR THAT'S OKAY. WELL THEN PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU. YES YOU'RE CORRECT IT IS YOU. DON'T KNOW THAT. OKAY GOOD SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS- WE'RE BUILDING ON OUR HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE IN A HIGHER CONSTRUCTION CAREERS- THAT INVESTMENT WILL TRAIN ANOTHER FORTY THREE HUNDRED WORKERS- APPROXIMATELY AT LEAST- FOCUSED ON EXPANDING- AND IT WILL. PRIMARILY BUILDING NEW NON CONSTRUCTION APPRENTICESHIPS BUT ALSO BUILDING ON TOP OF STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS SO OUR PRE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING THAT'S A HIRING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ACCESS AGAIN IN THE STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP- AND DEMAND FOR WORK IS DRIVEN- AT BY STATE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROCESS THE FEDERAL INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE SEE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE PEOPLE INTO. REALLY GOOD QUALITY JOBS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOCKED OUT OF THE OPPORTUNITY THIS THIS ECONOMIC PROSPERITY COMING- I THINK I'LL BE WITH. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME MANAGER UNLESS QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER RAINY I THINK WHAT WE JUST HEARD IS PART OF A LARGER CONVERSATION RELATED TO. OUR CLIMATE RESILIENCY CLIMATE JOBS GREEN JOBS OF SCALE AND SO IT'S A LARGER CONVERSATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID SEVERAL OF US ARE HAVING WITH THE TRADES AS WELL. AND SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE ESTIMATES ABOUT HOW MANY DISPLACED OIL AND GAS WORKERS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR EDT AND CW TV PROGRAMS. HOW WERE THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY MILLION FOR EDT AND THE FIFTEEN MILLION FIFTEEN MILLION FOR CWD BE DEVELOPED. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I MAKE MAYBE I COULD START MANAGER IF I IF THAT'S OKAY- PLEASE GO AHEAD. FOUR WE LOOK AT DATA ON THE NUMBER OF WHEN THE GAS EXTRACTION WORKERS IN KERN COUNTY ALONE- IN IT IT NUMBERS BETWEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND WORKERS- AND THE- BOILING CAP. I'M SORRY THE OIL AND GAS- ORPHAN WELL CAPPING PILOT- IT'S ENOUGH TO TARGET FIFTEEN HUNDRED WORKERS- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT. WITH THE INVESTMENT OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONSERVATION- IT IT'LL DRIVE DEMAND FOR WORKERS IN IN THAT SUB SECTOR BOB. READ PRETTY DRAMATICALLY- IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL INVESTMENT SO FAR IN THE PCP FOR CONSERVATION FOR THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A WHILE CAPPING. THE ESTIMATE- THAT THE CREATION OF EIGHT THOUSAND JOBS- THREE THOUSAND OF THOSE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND OF THOSE WOULD BE DIRECT JOBS- SO WE SEE THAT THERE'S- THREE- SIGNIFICANT DEMAND. FOR JOBS SO WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TRINITY IN A PART OF CALIFORNIA THAT REALLY NEEDS- THESE GOOD QUALITY JOBS- TO BUILD A PATH WHICH TO THEM- THE THESE ARE HIGHLY SKILLED- AT LEAST IN THE IN THE WELL CAPPING WORK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE- CAPPING OF THE- ORPHAN OIL WELLS. IT'S HIGHLY SKILLED WELL COMPENSATED WORK- THE WAGE RATES ARE FROM EIGHTY DOLLARS AN HOUR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR- AND- YEAH. SO I THINK THERE'S SIGNIFICANT DEMAND THE DATA BACKS IT UP. MISTER LUCKY. YES CERTAINLY I'M. JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE THE IDEA OF MOVING WORKERS IN POSITIONS WITH AN AVERAGE COMPENSATION OF A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WHERE THE MAJORITY OF HEALTH INSURANCE RETIREMENT BENEFITS. NOT INCLUDED IN THAT FIGURE. AND 23% ARE UNIONIZED. MOVING THEM TO STATE SPONSORED GREEN ENERGY JOBS. THAT HAVE LOWER AVERAGE SALARIES AND LOWER RATES OF UNIONIZATION. WAS NOTHING SHORT OF NOT REAL. LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS HAVE INDICATED THE AN EQUITABLE RELIEF PROGRAM WOULD BE MORE IN THE RANGE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION- FOR WAGE SUBSIDIES AND TRAINING TO HELP WORKERS WHAT ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE THE STATE TO INVEST AS MUCH THESE ARE LABOR REPORTS A SEVENTY SIX BILLION WITH A B. ENTER THE GREEN ENERGY SECTOR. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO. BALANCE THIS FIFTY MILLION WITH WHAT IT WOULD REALLY COST TO- TO THE BUT THESE WORKERS THAT ARE BEING PUSHED OUT OF OUR ECONOMY. BACK INTO A GREEN ENERGY JOBS. CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT. AND RECONCILE THE DISPARITY THERE. THANK YOU ALL TO ALL TRY TO RESPOND TO THAT- THE WELL CAPPING A PILOT IS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND IT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON- JOBS CREATED BY THE THAT- WELL CAPPING INVESTMENTS THROUGH CONSERVATION FROM. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THERE ARE WORKERS IN OIL AND GAS DRILLING THEIR HIGHLY PAID WELL CAUGHT COMPENSATED. WORKERS AS I AS I SAID AS YOU POINTED OUT- THIS THIS WORK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO UP- PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WORKERS WHO WHO OTHERWISE MAY BE AFFECTED- BY BY DOWNTURN THAT SECTOR- TO GO TO WORK IN A HIGHLY COMPENSATED WORK DOING THAT THE WELL CAPPING- IT ALSO CREATES OPPORTUNITIES I THINK FOR OTHER WORKERS. IN KERN COUNTY- TO GO THROUGH TRAINING SIGNIFICAN TRAINING. THROUGH EXISTING STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT SERVE KERN COUNTY- TO GO TO WORK- IN THE END WELL CAPPING. SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE I THINK RARE OPPORTUNITIES WERE IN INVESTING IN CLIMATE MITIGATION IN A WAY THAT'S CREATING NEW JOBS AND BUILDING TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT REALLY FOCUSED ON TRANSITIONING CURRENT WORKERS EXCITING. OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED. BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S A MUCH BIGGER. OKAY I THINK YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME BUT THAT WAS GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FUNDS BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT MORE TO THE E. D. D. THE PERSON. THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE FIVE ZERO THE FIFTY MILLION VERSUS THE SEVENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT IT WOULD TAKE. TO TO MAKE THE SYSTEM HALL. FOR THESE WORKERS. THIS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PARDON- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ARE INTENDED TO ASSIST EMPLOYERS THAT ARE ALREADY DISLOCATED ARM AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF THAT FUND AND HOW IT'S DESIGNED- IT'S NOT AS INTENDED TO REPLACE. THOSE DROPS PER SE OKAY REALLY. WE SONGS WERE CLEAR ON THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO- MAKING THOSE WORKERS HOLE. THAT THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO CLARIFY HERE THAT IT'S A IT'S A- I'M A STEP CERTAINLY BUT A VERY SMALL ONE. THANK YOU MISTER LACKING ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. OKAY HEARING NONE THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR IS THAT A PANEL NUMBER FOUR WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE- TRAINING CAMPUSES LET'S BEGIN AGAIN- MISTER RANEY HERE ON. THANK YOU VENTURE. MEMBERS THE GOOD MOVEMENT WORKFORCE TRAINING CENTER- REQUESTING A HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS BUT THE TOTAL COST OF THE TRAINING CENTER IS ACTUALLY HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A HUNDRED TEN- THIS BUILDS ON ACTUALLY HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP WORK WE'VE DONE- AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES IN LONG BEACH OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- TO LABOR MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AMONG. THE LONG TO WORKERS I'LL W. THE LA PORT THE PMA THE SECOND MARITIME ASSOCIATION AND THE PORT TERMINAL OPERATORS AT THE PORT OF LA IN THE PORT OF LONG BEACH AS YOU KNOW- IT'S THE SAN PEDRO- BAYPORT COMPLEX HANDLES MORE CONTAINERS PER SHIP CALL THAN ANY OTHER PORT COMPLEX IN THE WORLD- YET IT DOESN'T HAVE A CENTRALIZED LOCATION FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING. SO THE INTENT HERE IS TO CREATE A SAFE TRAINING SPACE AWAY FROM THE BUSY ACTIVITIES OF THE TERMINALS- AND ONE THAT CAN REPLICATE THE COULDN'T GOODS MOVEMENT ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS THE MARINE CARGO TERMINALS- THE LA LONG BEACH PORT SET ASIDE A FIFTEEN ACRE SITE FOR THE TRAINING CENTER- THE CENTER OF THE TYPE OF TRAINING WILL FOCUS ON- WOULD INCLUDE EXPANDED LASHER TRAINING WHICH WE STARTED HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP THERE. ZERO EMISSION CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT TRAINING FOR WORKERS TO LEARN HOW TO OPERATE MAINTAIN REPAIR EQUIPMENT- THAT DIRECTLY SUPPORTS INDUSTRIES OUT LOW EMISSIONS TRANSITION OF MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR ALSO OF. AUTOMATED EQUIPMENT- THE- THE OTHER IN HERE IS- IS BROAD. IN AND I THINK AMBITIOUS- IT'S A REALLY IMPACT THE REGION AND THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN. PROVIDING SPACE FOR OTHER HIRING EMPLOYERS THAT ARE SEEKING TO TRAIN THEIR WORKFORCES. ARE AFRAID EQUIPMENT INCLUDING TRUCKS FORKLIFTS SHIP TO SHORE CRANES- AND I'LL LEAVE IT THERE MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER RAINY ARE YOU HAPPENING TO SOMEONE ELSE. I DON'T BELIEVE SO OKAY THEN WE'LL GOTO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOLLOWED BY L. A. U. BERMAN A FINANCE- PATRICK TOPPIN- NO FURTHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR OFFICE HOURS PUBLISHED A PIECE ABOUT A WAITING THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY PROPOSAL IN CONCLUDING THAT THE TRAINING CAMPUS RAISE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER- YOU POINT OUT THAT THAT- YEAH THAT THE CAMPUS IS NOT LIKELY TO MATERIALLY IMPROVE SUPPLY CHAIN RESTRICTIONS- AT THE PORTS RIGHT NOW- THAT WE'VE SEEN AS RESULT OF THE PROJECT PANDEMIC IN RECENT YEARS- BUT IT COULD PROVE HELPFUL IN THE LONG TERM. WE THINK ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS WORK FOR THIS COMPANY AND THE LEGISLATURE TRUMP GRAPPLING WITH HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CAMPUS IS TO TURN. ON WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGE THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SPEAKS UP EITHER CURRENTLY OR IN THE FUTURE AND TO ENSURE THAT TRAINING CAPACITY IS THE BOTTLENECK FOR THAT SHORTAGE- BECAUSE THE FIRST WORKFORCE SHORTAGE. IT COULD BE IN OTHER AREAS IT MIGHT NOT BE TRAINING RELATED AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ARM IS ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT THE PROBLEM AT ITS ROOT CAUSE- AND ENSURE THAT THAT THERE ARE NO WORKFORCE SUPPLY CONCERNS AT THE. PORTS IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAY ALAMO. ABOUT OF QUESTIONS AS UP AS WELL MISS RANEY. RUN THE DATA. THE TRAINING AND WORK AND WORKER SHORTAGE RELATED TO THE GOODS MOVEMENT AT THE PORTS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I THOUGHT I THOUGHT THE L. A. AS- ANALYSIS WAS WAS QUITE GOOD AS USUAL- THE- THE- NATURE OF THE SHORTAGE- IS THAT THERE. THERE ISN'T TRAINING CAPACITY PORT. SO HAVE. LONG SHOT WORKERS THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO TO WORK AT THE PORT THE WAGES ARE QUITE GOOD- THERE LONG LONG WAITING LISTS OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD WHO WOULD LOVE TO BECOME LONGER WORKERS- THE ISSUE IS. US LITERALLY SPACE TO DO THE TRAINING SO. ALL THE LONGER WORKERS ARE PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY- TRAIN TO BE CRANE OPERATORS FOR EXAMPLE- BUT THE TRAINING IS SCATTERED ACROSS. SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARCELS AROUND THE PORT. AND AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE UP THE CREEK THEY TRAIN ON ACTIVE CRANES- AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THOSE CRANES THERE THERE NO- EACH. CHANGE THAT ARE. WORKING ON TO MOVE CARGO AROUND AROUND THE AT THE TERMINALS- SO THERE'S NO PLACE FOR WORKERS TO GET TRAINED AND THAT SORT OF. A PROBLEM IS CAUSING. A SHORTAGE OF SKILLS AND TRAINING AT THE PORT SO AND I UNDERSTAND. AND AGREE THAT THIS THIS IS A LONG GAME STUFF IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OVERNIGHT. BUT IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE AT THE PORT FOR SOME TIME SO- THAT- THE REQUEST HERE IS TO START TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BY BUILDING A TRAINING CENTER ON THE FIFTEEN ACRE PARCEL- SO TO REALLY ITS TRAINING CAPACITY AND NOT. BUT NOT A JOB QUALITY ISSUE IT'S NOT AN ACCESS TO JOBS ISSUE IT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO HAVING. A PLACE TO HAVE EQUIPMENT. THAT YOU CAN TRAIN PEOPLE IN A SAFE MANNER- SO WE CAN START RESPONDING TO THE TO THE SHORTAGES. OF SKILLS OF THE PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH. THANK YOU MISTER RANEY I BEEN TO BOTH THOSE PORTS AND THEY ARE MASSIVE AND JUST. INCREDIBLE TO JUST WATCH IT OPERATE AND HOW IT. REALLY JUST- PROVIDES ALL THE GOODS AND SERVICES NOT ONLY FOR THE STATE FOR THE NATION. AS A FOLLOW UP THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT COVER THE ENTIRE PROJECT COST TO BUILD THE CAMPUS. CAN SEE W. D. B. D. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON HOW. REMAINING COSTS WILL BE FUNDED. THE LA AND LONG BEACH PORTS WILL PICK UP THE DIFFERENCE OF THAT COST- AS I SAID WE'RE WE'RE- REQUESTING A HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE TOTAL COST IS CLOSER TO A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE- THE DIFFERENCE THERE'S GONNA BE PICKED UP BY THE LA AND LONG BEACH PORTS. AND AS A FOLLOW UP IS THAT A FORMAL AGREEMENT- THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I DO BELIEVE THAT- THAT THE ALLEY PORTANT LA AT THE LONG BEACH PORTS HAVE UP FORMALLY DEVELOPED THE BUDGET- AND HAVE SET ASIDE FUNDING- TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE OF THAT COST. OKAY WHEN YOU GET A MOMENT CAN YOU- CAN WE FOLLOW UP ON THAT JUST TO BE SURE. YES ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER SIX WHICH I BELIEVE IS OUR LAST ISSUE OF THE DAY. AND THIS IS THE D. I. R.
