I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE OH NINE THIS BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION COULD DEVELOP MODEL FOR ALL PROTOCOLS HELP STUDENTS OFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SH AB THREE OH NINE INCLUDES CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROTOCOL CAN INSURANCE THAT THEY ARE DRAFTED WITH SCHOOL STAFF AND MINE. OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE ON THE FRONTLINE OF BECAUSE THEY NINETEEN PANDEMIC WORK WITH EVERY DAY THEY CARE ABOUT THEM AND THEY WANT TO DO WHAT THEY CAN TO HELP THEM. THE PANDEMIC HAS HEIGHTENED THE NEED FOR EIGHTY THREE ALONG THE CHALLENGING TIME FOR ALL OF US. CARS DIDN'T. THEN MAKE A CHANGE LIVES THEY CAN'T IRAQ WITH THE- FRIEND BUT IF. MATE THE WAY THEY GET TO. THEY CAN'T PLAY THE FOUR THEY LOVE THEM GRADUATION DIFFERENT. AND MANY OF THEIR HAVE THEIR- OR STRUGGLING KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND ON THE TABLE. IN HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME BELA WITH THE- THAT ARE STOCKS ROM THE- AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH AT. AB THREE ON IRAQI. THE THAT. STAFF NO THIS IS ARE THE NEXT HELP. FIVE THOUGHT THAT WOULD GUIDE.

TODAY BUT BY THE WAY. FOR A LONG TIME IT'S BEEN BUT AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND THIS- I KNOW I. HAD THIS BILL A FEW YEARS AGO UNDER PREVIOUS GOVERNOR THAT VETO THIS- AND THIS BILL TYPICALLY BILL COME FROM A SPONSOR SOMEONE BRINGS YOU A PROBLEM SOMEONE BRINGS YOU AN IDEA SOMEONE FROM THE PUBLIC. SOMEONE FROM AN INDUSTRY FROM I'M FROM THE SCHOOL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THIS BILL ACTUALLY. CAME ALREADY ORIGINALLY FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM WHERE AND I. AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER HAD A STUDENT. THAT I NOTICED WAS HAVING ISSUES AND I WENT TO THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR. AND I BASICALLY HANDED THE ISSUE OFF TO HER. AND I JUST DIDN'T FEEL THAT EVEN ACCOUNTS OR KNEW WHERE TO GO. EXACTLY NOW THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS I HOPE I HAS BEEN. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT HAS BUT I THINK WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS REALLY BILLS PROTOCOL SOME POLICY AT THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT AT THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL SO THAT WHEN A TEACHER NO STUDENTS HAVING STRUGGLES- ESPECIALLY BE THEY MENTAL- THAT THERE IS A PLACE FOR THAT TEACHER TO GO. AND THE ISSUE OF BECAUSE THE TEACHER SHOULD BE DIAGNOSED SHOULDN'T BE TREATING TO THE TEACHER MAYBE. QUITE OFF BASE IT MAY JUST BE A BAD DAY FOR THAT STUDENT- BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME PROTOCOLS AND POLICIES SOME NEXT STEPS. SO THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND SOME FINALITY. TO THE ISSUE. AT A SCHOOL SITE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND OFTEN. POLICIES GET BUILT UP AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL NO RELIEF USE DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS AND IT TO DO IT SCHOOL SITE LEVEL- PERFECTLY. BUT THIS IS ONE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING MENTALLY HOW DO WE IDENTIFY THEM. HAVE WHO DOES A TEACHER GO TO AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS GIVEN MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM MORE THAN ONCE HAVING THIS ISSUE. AS A TEACHER NOT EVEN KNOWING DO I GO TO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. DO I GO TO SCHOOL COUNSELOR. SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST ISN'T ALWAYS THERE- I'D G. MAYBE I KNOW I GOT ACCOUNTS OR DO I GO TO- YOU KNOW ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL WHO WHAT ARE THOSE THE SCHOOL SITE. PARKS AND BY AND LARGE THEY'RE NOT ESTABLISHED ACROSS OUR STATE THEY'RE NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS OUR STATE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS. BILL SEEKS TO DO NOT TO MICROMANAGE BUT TO GIVE SCHOOL SITES A PATH. TO HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND IDENTIFY THEM. AND GET THEM SERVICES SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL. I THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING IT TODAY ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

AND YOU MAY PERCEIVE IN REDDING. MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THREE SIX ONE AND PROVIDING OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE RECOMMENDED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE EIGHTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE. I AB THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE HAS THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS IT EACH OF WHICH WILL STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM TO BETTER SERVE OUR STATE. FIRST THE BILL WOULD GREATLY LIMIT THE SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION OF PRESCHOOL AGE STUDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S EARLY LEARNING SYSTEM NASH NATIONAL DATA HAS INDICATED TO. INDICATED TO VERY CONCERNING TRENDS AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION NOT ONLY ARE SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS MORE COMMON IN THE PRESCHOOL SETTING THAN K. TWELVE THE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT CHILDREN OF COLOR. RESEARCH HAS ALSO INDICATED THAT SCHOOL EXPULSION AND SUSPENSION PRACTICES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVITY CATION- AND LYFT OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION TO HARMING A YOUNG CHILD'S ACADEMIC PROSPECTS RESEARCH HAS ALSO FOUND THAT SUSPENSIONS AND% EXPULSIONS DO NOTHING TO IMPACT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE. OF CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR. WELL THIS FIRST MAJOR COMPONENT IDENTIFIES THE KEY PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA'S PRESCHOOL SYSTEM AND MOVES TO IMMEDIATELY AND HARMFUL- I'M SORRY TO IMMEDIATELY END HARMFUL PRACTICES THE NEXT COMPONENT OF THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A PART OF A PROACTIVE SOLUTION. AND WHAT WE ARE DOING. SORRY AND WE ARE DOING THIS THROUGH THE USE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATIONS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS EASY M. C. H. M. H. C. ECM H. C. SERVICES ARE PUT A PROVEN MODEL WAY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WILL ENSURE THE PRESCHOOL SETTING AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE STUDENT. THE STAFF AND TO FAMILIES THESE SERVICES CREATE A MEANS OF PROVIDING ADEQUATE SUPPORTS TWO TEACHERS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TO PROMOTE POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH BUT FOR THE EFFECTS OF TOXIC STRESS AND TRAUMA AND BRING OUT THE MOST OPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING OF EACH AND EVERY CHILD. SO WITH THIS BILL WE ARE NOT SIMPLY TRYING TO HAND OFF PROVIDERS BY LIMITING. I'M SORRY TYING THE HANDS OF PROVIDERS BY LIMITING SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS WERE ALSO PROVIDING THEM WITH A NEW TOOL TO HELP ADDRESS CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR IN MORE HOLISTIC AND PROACTIVE MANNER. THE FINAL COMPONENT OF THIS BILL WILL BE FOR THE STATE TO BEGIN COLLECTING DATA ON THE USE OF SUSPENSION AND A- SO THAT PAUL MAKERS HERE CAN BECOME. UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR IS WORKING. THIS LEGISLATION HAS HAD INPUT FROM POLICY EXPERTS THROUGHOUT OUR NATION AND ENJOY A LARGE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT. THE BILL HAS A WIDE COALITION OF SUPPORT AND IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY LEARNING AND CARE MASTER PLAN RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR. ON THE PHONE WITH US TODAY WE HAVE SOME OF OUR CO SPONSORS FROM CONVICTED ANGLE AND BLACK MEN FOR EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE FIRST WITNESS I HAVE IS- IS WITNESS MORTON. IT I BELIEVE THAT AS THE FIRST WITNESS TODAY.

ELEVATED LEVELS OF EXCLUSION DICTIONARY. ACTIVE NATIVE AMERICAN AND LATINO CHILDREN YET NO OTHER STUDENT WHO'VE EXPERIENCED LEVELS OF DISPROPORTIONATE DISCIPLINE GREATER THAN A BLACK MALE CHILDREN. WHILE MORE DATA IS NEEDED FOR A STATE A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE IN A REPORT BY NEEDS OF PROFESSORS UCLA AND SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY. ON THE BLOCK WITH A FIVE POINT SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SUSPENDED THAN PAID AVERAGE FOR THE MORE REPORT LEVEL BEGINNING IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN COMMENT MANY PRESCHOOL TEACHERS.

THANK YOU IN THE EIGHTY. SIX ONE. THANK YOU TO OUR WITH NEXT WITH SINCE THE OF THEIR SO ONE. HELLO NINETEEN AS LONG LIFE AND HE AND BY PRESIDENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION AFTER DANGAL A LARGISH CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROVIDER IN THE BAY AREA. MICHAEL THREE A OF EIGHT FOR TIME. SERVING OVER ONE HUNDRED CLASSROOMS. TEACHERS AND CAL PROVIDER ARE HER GROWING FIGURE AND THEY'RE IN ON YOUNG CHILDREN AS PROFOUND TEACHERS DESERVE AND REQUIRE ADEQUATE SUPPORT CAN BE EFFECTIVE. ABOUT ON FULL TOLL OTHER AND- ENCOURAGED PER CHALLENGES THAT HAVE PLAGUED ECP PROGRAM ACROSS CALIFORNIA YEAR AFTER YEAR WHICH CULMINATE INTO THE EXCLUSION OF BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN. EXPANSION AND EXPULSION AB THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE PROVIDES EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION. HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING. THERE IS A FORMULA YOU LOOK EARLY CHILDHOOD HEALTH CONSERVE. IT ADDED BASED MENTAL HEALTH. THE ONGOING COLLAB PARTNER AND ECSTATIC BETWEEN. EDUCATORS AND PAM. AND THAT'S IT CREATES AND THE- THAT. THE GATE IN. AND GENERATE TAILORED STRATEGY. TO WATER BECAUSE ISSUES. LET FORMULA BE. FROM THE SPECIAL ACT FOR. AND UNIQUE SKILL SET OF THE COULD WORK. FOR AB THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE OUT THAT THE FIFTH MASTER LEVEL AT. PROFESSIONALS FOR AND TO REQUIRED THAT UNDER CONSULTS ABOUT NOW AND TRIED TO TRY ME AND IT ON T. CHILDREN OF CONCERN AND NORMATIVELY UPON ALL CHILL IN THE STUDY. WITH IT BECAUSE OF APPROACH AND SPECIALIZED EXPERT. EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH COMPANY WELL AND GAVE THE EASE EASY. TO MORE FOR ACHIEVE THE IMPACT IT PROMISES. WILL DO IS GO TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- WAS QUICK SILVA YEAH YES I REMEMBER- NORMALLY IF SUPPORTERS THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR ON THE BILL AND- AS A- CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. TEACHING ELEMENTARY WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE NEEDS TO BE DISCIPLINE WHEN THERE NEEDS TO BE- INTERVENTION WITH PARENTS WITH TEACHERS AND COMPLETE- STAFF APPROACH BUT LOOKING AT EXPELLING YOUNG CHILDREN- I THINK THAT WHEN WE BRING THE BEST MINDS TOGETHER. AND THE BEST PRACTICES TOGETHER THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE AT OUR FINGERTIPS THOSE ARE GOING TO PRODUCE THE BEST RESULTS AND SO- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO WORK WITH CHILDREN THAT CAN. DE ESCALATE SITUATIONS THAT CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED THE PER SUPPORT THE PARENTS NEED AND THE STAFF THAT'S WORKING WITH THEM SO I THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BILL AND I THINK AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CHILDREN. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE WAYS THAT WE CAN TO NURTURE THEM AT THE YOUNGEST AGES. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THOSE EARLY INTERVENTIONS ON THOSE EARLY EXPERIENCES LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR MANY- FUTURE- SCENARIOS AND IF A CHILD HAS A LOT OF TRAUMA AT A LOT VERY YOUNG AGE THAT CAN STAY WITH THEM REALLY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE SO EVERYTHING WE CAN DO. AS A PUBLIC- EDUCATION AND WITHIN SCHOOLS TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S NURTURING AND THAT TIME SPEAKS TO THE CHALLENGES THAT SOME OF THESE CHILDREN FACE IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR BILL. THANK YOU- MISTER COLORFUL. I FULLY AGREE WITH THOSE COMMENTS AND I AGREE WITH TE PREMISE OF THIS BILL THAT- YOU KNOW A CHILD- PRESCHOOLER I SHOULDN'T BE EXPELLED SUSPENDED- YOU KNOW AN EXCEPTION TO THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY OF CIRCUMSTANCES MY RESERVATION IS WHETHER YOU KNOW WE IS A STATEWIDE POLICY MAKING BODY ARE BEST POSITIONED TO DEFINE WITH SPECIFICITY WHAT THOSE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF SUSPENSION IT'S ANY REMOVAL OF A CHILD. FROM ALL OR PART OF THE PROGRAM DAY SO YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT PUNITIVE HAVING A CHILD MISS PART OF A OF ONE DAY OF SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW GIVEN THE SORT OF INFINITE VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CAN DEVELOP- YOU KNOW AT A SCHOOL IN ANY PART OF THE STATE- I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT THAT DEFINITION IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW SCHOOL LEADERS TO. ADEQUATELY MEET THAT THE NEEDS OF THEIR OF ALL THEIR STUDENTS SO I YOU DON'T RESPOND YOU DON'T WANT TO IF YOU ARE NOT A DEALER- I TAUGHT KINDERGARTEN FOR THREE YEARS FIRST GRADE FOR FIVE AND EIGHT YEARS IN FOURTH GRADE SO I CAN TELL YOU- SPECIFICALLY THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AND YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SOMETIMES WE TIE THE HANDS OF ADMINISTRATORS BUT THE- BUT I THINK FOR ME BUT THE MOST IMPACT IMPACT FULL TIME OF MY TEACHING WITH KINDERGARTEN WHEN. IF WE EXPEL THE TILED WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS REALLY REINFORCING THAT THEIR BAD BEHAVIOR IS GOOD BECAUSE IF YOU ARE STARTING PRESCHOOL OR KINDERGARTEN THAT MOST KIDS DON'T HAVEN'T HAD THAT EXPERIENCE OF SCHOOL SO THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO AND SO IF THE ACT OUT AND WE SUSPEND THE KIDS THEN THEY GO HOME. WE'RE REINFORCING THAT BY BAD BEHAVIOR BECAUSE GUESS WHAT THEY WANT TO STAY HOME BECAUSE ALL THEY'RE GOING TO DO AT HOME AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES YOU KNOW TO YOUR BUT IF YOU KNOW THE FIRST PART OF YOUR YOUR COMMENT IN YOUR QUESTION THE SECOND PART IS THAT'S WHY IT'S CRITICAL THAT WEPROVIDE NOT ONLY ARE THE MENTAL CONSULTATION TO THE CHILD RIGHT WE'RE PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THE TEACHER AND FOR THE PARENTS. BECAUSE AS. A CLASSROOM TEACHER WE ARE EXPECTED TO BE. EVERYTHING TO A EVERYBODY. I WITH A GRANDMA MOM DAD I WAS YOU KNOW PSYCHOLOGIST PSYCHIATRIST- NUTRITIONIST. AND WE'RE QUITE FRANKLY OUR EDUCATION TO BECOME TEACHERS DOESN'T PROVIDE THE SUPPORT. THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES ARE BACK THAT'S WHY THIS BILL INCLUDES THE MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATIONS. TO ASSIST THE TEACHER AS WELL NOT JUST THE STUDENT OR THE FAMILY. AND OF COURSE IF THERE'S REALLY EGREGIOUS- BEHAVIOR THEN THAT TEAM CAN COME TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT IF WHAT WE'R DOING IS NOT WORKING BUT I THINK FOR ME IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. TO THE STUDENT FIRST INFORMAL STRAIGHT THE FAMILY BUT THE TEACHERS SO THAT. TEACHERS ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS ARE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO INTERVENE IN THESE CASES AND- YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY B. THESE KIDS ARE THREE AND FOUR. AND SO AGAIN IF WE SUSPEND THEM. IF I'M THREE OR FOUR I WANT TO GO HOME AND PLAY. RIGHT AND SO WE'RE ONLY- ENCOURAGING BAD BEHAVIOR BY BY SUSPENDING THEM SO I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT AND AGAIN. PROVIDING IS WHAT I THINK FOR ME IS THE MOSTIMPORTANT. AS ALL THREE COMPONENTS ARE THEPARENT THE TEACHER AND THE FAMILY IS GETTING THAT SUPPORT. YEAH I THINK THAT THAT IS GREAT AND- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THIS BILL TO SUPPORT AND THE SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES AND I AGREE WITH YOU THE SUSPENSION CAN BE SORT OF OVER USED. AS AN INTERVENTION- AND THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE SHARING BEST PRACTICES OR WE CAN JUST MIGHT MY OBJECTION IS WITH THE HARD AND FAST RULE THAT. YOU KNOW PRECLUDES AN INDIVIDUALIZED EVALUATION- YOU KNOW INTO THAT IS THAT THAT IS SENSITIVE TO. THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES OF PARTICULAR CHILD IN A PARTICULAR SCHOOL. OKAY I ACTUALLY THINK IT DOES THOUGH IT DOES YEAH I THINK IT DOES I THINK YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT I THINK YOUR CONCERN IS IT. THEN THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY NEVER RIGHT- BECAUSE AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER MY MIDDLE SCHOOL A LOT OF YEARS RIGHT- YOU HAVE TO HAVE TOOLS BEFORE YOU THAT YOU CAN HELP. RIGHT SECRETARY HEATHER THIRTY FIVE OTHER CHILDREN IN THAT CLASSROOM- THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE ARE SAFE AS WELL. SO I DON'T GET SAYS NEVER JUST SAID SAID SOME PROTOCOLS RIGHT AND I WILL THROUGH PROGRESS AND HOW I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ON THIS I DON'T WANT. DON'T I DON'T RECALL WHAT IT SAID BUT THE TEACHERS DO HAVE TO HAVE THE IMMEDIATE ABILITY REMOVE A CHILD FROM A CLASSROOM OFTEN FOR JUST THAT CHILD SOMETHING. YET OR MAYBE THE SAFETY OF OTHERS SO THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED. YEAH I THINK WE'RE SEEING HERE WHAT WE'RE ASKING HERE IN CALLING. FOR HER SOME PROTOCOLS BEFORE WE DO- SUSPEND. AND RIGHT INSTEAD OF GOING DIRECTLY TO THIS RANCH AND ACCORDING TO THE SAP CENTER AT THE HOSPITAL BUT- SHALL. NOT THAT THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. GIVEN SOME EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES SO I THINK. I THINK WERE. MOSTLY ON THE SAME PAGE RIGHT AND ACTING AND THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK WE MADE SOME AMENDMENTS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WHERE THAT LOOPHOLES MAY BE. AN OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT FOR EVERYONE BUT I THINK THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH- YOU KNOW IT'S PROGRESS HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE KIDS ARE GETTING THAT THAT- SUPPORT AND THEN IF THAT DOESN'T WORK THEN THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THE TEAM COMES TOGETHER AND SAYS. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO THIS HASN'T WORKED BUT I DON'T IT'S ONLY STUDENT SAFETY RIGHT THAT COULD BE THE ULTIMATE REASON FOR- EVEN THE OF REMOVAL PART OF THE SCHOOL DAY THERE'S NO OTHER. REASON THAT CAN BE USED WELL I THINK XIN RIGHT BUT THAT YOU KNOW AND THE REASON FOR THIS BILL IS WHEN WE DID THIS THE RESEARCH ON THE STATISTICS- BUT BUT THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WERE BEING SUSPENDED FOR BITING. WHICH WHICH YOU KNOW IN ITS FACE RIGHT IS A BITING HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA DEVELOP DEVELOPMENTAL CHART THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY SO THERE WILL MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONS BY BITING. THE WORK WORK WITH THEY WERE SPENDING THE KIDS FOR DOING SOMETHING THAT THEIR SUBPOENA DEVELOPMENTALLY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE SO YES TO THAT. THE STUDENT SAFETY HOWEVER- THE POPULATION THAT WAS BEING- IT SUSPENDED AND EXPELLED WAS. OVER MORE OF A BIAS RATHER THAN THE THAN THE ACT BECAUSE ALL THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. GO THROUGH THAT'S THE DEVICE OF BITING. OKAY I MISS BENNETT. THANK YOU- I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE TO HELP WITH THE INTENT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I PARTICULARLY- THE BIASED ASPECT AND THE THAT IS INHERENTLY OUT THERE EVEN IF WELL INTENTIONED PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE IT- TO PROTECT THE GOALS OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ASK US THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD- IT TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FACT THAT WE'RE SUCH A LEGALISTIC SOCIETY NOW. THAT IF WE START GETTING LAWSUITS BECAUSE OF THE TEMPORARY REMOVAL FROM ONE EDUCATIONAL SETTING YOUR IDEA THAT YOU KNOW OF THESE KIDS GET SENT HOME IN THEIR ONLINE THAT I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT'S A REINFORCEMENT FOR MISBEHAVIOR BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE STUDENT AROUND AND SCORE MOVING FROM THIS CLASSROOM INO SOME OTHER SETTING. SO THAT- SO I JUST DON'T WANT YOUR DEFINITION TO BE SO TIGHT THAT WE START GETTING LAWSUITS OF THAT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND THEN HAVE THE SCHOOLS PUT ACTUALLY PUSH BACK ON THIS DEFINITION SO MY ONLY REQUEST IS THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD YOU COULD YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE FLEXIBILITY OF THAT DEFINITION OF WHAT IS. EXPULSION IS OUT OF THE SCHOOL AND SENT HOME VERSES TEMPORARILY REMOVAL YOU KNOW IT'S WEIRD WHEN YOU SAY FOR A EVEN PART OF THE DAY WHAT PART ABOUT TEMPORARY MOVE FROM ONE CLASSROOM TO ANOTHER OR TO THE OFFICE OR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO- I AM SURE YOU'LL DO A GOOD JOB THANK YOU I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND THE AND THE DISCUSSION AND I THINK THAT'S THE INTENT YOU KNOW OUR INTENT BASICALLY IS TO. TO ASSIST AND- THE CHILDREN AND AGAIN AS A FORMER TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT- I NEEDED AS MUCH HELP AS I CAN GET WHEN I HAD THE- THE YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT SOME CHILDREN THAT I WASN'T- CAPABLE OF HELPING AND THIS I THINK WILL PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT FOR THE TEACHERS SO IT YOUR POINT IS WELL THANK TAKEN THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU TO MR BENNETT'S. POINT I THINK WE SEEKING DURING SURE THAT WE DON'T MAKE A- FROM THE ROOM- WHICH I YOU AGREE WITH- AND THEN. EVEN YOU KNOW. THIS IS NOT THIRTY DAYS JUST. BUT I JUST WONDER IF IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE CD DEVELOP SOME GUIDANCE OR SOME POLICIES. ALONG THESE LINES AND THEN HAVE EVERY LOCAL. CHILD CARE CENTER DOT THEIR OWN POLICY WITH REGARD TO HOW THE ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT LESS. MICROMANAGING A LITTLE AND AVOID THE- WELL I COMPLETELY LAWSUIT BUT EITHER WAY THAT'S- HOW I DID IT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND YOU KNOW I'VE GOT SEVEN MORE YEARS- HOPEFULLY IF I KEEP GETTING REELECTED AND- IN MY COMMITMENT IS TO WORK THROUGH. SOME OF THESE POLICIES TO BE ABLE TO COME TO THAT SPOT WHERE WHERE. YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE BEING FAIR TO EVERYONE ESPECIALLY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHEN. YOU KNOW WE'RE MOVING INTO THAT DIRECTION WHERE WE ARE MICHEL MANAGING SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS APPRECIATE APPRECIATE% YOUR EFFORTS- WITH THAT- WE HAVE GONE TO- COMMITTEE MEMBER QUESTIONS- IS THERE ANY IN THE ROOM THAT WISHES TO TESTIFY IN THE BILL.

THE BAY AREA AT&amp;T IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF AB SEVEN SIXTY TWO AND WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. IN OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL TO PROTECT CHILDREN'S HEALTH. IN CURRENT LAW PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTING A NEW PUBLIC SCHOOL PUBLICLY FUNDED CHARTER SCHOOL SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SEVERAL ACTS OF DUE DILIGENCE THE BETTER ENSURE THE HEALTH OF THEIR FUTURE STUDENTS AND SCHOOL STAFF. THEY DETERMINE THAT THE PROPERTY COULD BE BUILT UPON IS NOT A CURRENT OR FORMER HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE OR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE RELEASE SITE. THEY CONSULT WITH STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO MAKE A FINDING THAT THE HEALTH RISKS OR OTHER POLLUTION SOURCES DO NOT AND WILL NOT CONSTITUTE. AN ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL ENDANGERMENT OF PUBLIC HELP THE PERSON TO ATTEND TO BE EMPLOYED AT THE SCHOOL. THIS INCLUDES WORKING WITH THE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT OR AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT TO IDENTIFY BOTH PERMITTED AND NON PERMITTED FACILITIES WITHIN THAT DISTRICTS AUTHORITY.

THAT MIGHT REASONABLY BE ANTICIPATED TO ADMIT HAZARDOUS AIR EMISSIONS. THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY APPLY TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND WHILE WE ARE NOT CLAIMING THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF THE SCHOOLS ARE POORLY CITED INCREASING LAND USE DENSITY AND RE PURPOSING INFILL SITES RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT WITHOUT SIMILAR DUE DILIGENCE.

THANKS THIS IS SOME OF THE BEFORE AND THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIRTY YEARS AGO I FLUNKED OUT OF MY LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD TO GO TO MY LOCAL ADULT ADD TO TURN MY LFE AROUND AND HERE I AM TODAY AND I KNOW THAT IT'LL EDUCATION MATTERS- THIS ADULT THAT TOOK A BIG HIT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION- WE HAVE SINCE RESTORED SOME FUNDING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IN OUR STATE BUDGET- BY TWO OFTEN SOME OF THESE ADULT EDUCATION CONSORTIUM MEMBERS TOWARD THEIR MONIES AND DON'T SPEND IT AND INSTEAD HAVE CARRYOVER FUNDS YEAR AFTER YEAR- THIS BUILDING SENSUALLY SAY THAT IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A CARRY OVER A YEAR AFTER YEAR BUT WE SHOULD HAVE A REASONABLE CAP OF 15% SUMMER CONCERNED THAT THESE MONIES WOULD GO BACK TO THE- BY THE GENERAL FUND I KNOW THESE MONIES WOULD GO BACK TO FIND ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THIS IS NECESSARY ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURE THAT MORE OF OUR STATE MONIES GO TO WHERE THEY ARE ALLOCATED- IN pPROGRAM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- WITH ME ARE TO- SPEAKERS WHO THEY ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BELFAST CARE ACT. THANK YOU. I WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE JOINT TURKEY FROM THE FORMER CHIEF MOUNT DIABLO UNIFIED BOARD MEMBER. AND KATHLEEN PORTER THE BOAT WHICH EVERYONE IS IN THE QUEUE MAY. PROCEED. OKAY I MIGHT HI MY NAME IS SAID TO ENTERTAIN AND I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WHY I AM SUPPORTIVE OF AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE AS A FORMER TEACHER ADMINISTRATOR AND SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FROM OUT OF A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I HAVE A FRONT ROW VIEW OF HOW THIS BILL WILL BE GOOD FOR ADULT LEARNERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEED FOR EDUCATION TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING A MEMBER OF THE STATE WORKERS JOINTLY CONVENED A TWENTY THIRTEEN BY THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE CANCERS OFFICE FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF DESIGNING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB EIGHTY SIX IN A WAY THAT WOULD ENSURE SERVICES ARE RESOURCES ARE OPTIMIZED AND MOST EFFECTIVE DATE ALL THE TRADITIONAL REGION CONSTRUCTION STRUCTURE CAME FROM THIS PROCESS WITH AN EXPECTATION THAT LOCAL PLANS WOULD BE BASED ON PRIORITIZE WHO NEEDS A TRUE COORDINATION COLLABORATIONAMONG K. TWELVE AND THREE BECAUSE THAT ALL EDUCATORS. AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE A LOT OF HARD WORK IS STARTING TO THE FABRIC OF THE PAST SEVEN YEARS WITH MANY POSITIVE OUTCOMES AT THIS STAGE IN THE PROCESS HOWEVER SOME PERSISTENT CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND EIGHTY FOURTEEN NINETY ONE IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS ONE OF THEM THAT IS ENSURING THAT PRECIOUS DOLLARS NEEDED FOR UNMET NEEDS ARE IN. FACT BEING UTILIZED IN A TIMELY MANNER. A MAJORITY OF EDUCATION CONCERTS MEMBERS DATE OTHER. PRO IS THERE. SOURCE OF RAW. RATE TO SERVES TO AND COMMUNITY SCENE DOLLARS CARRIED OVER YEAR AFTER YEAR. FLIES IN THE FACE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO INCREASE UNNECESSARY TENSION OF CONSTRUCTION TABLE. LOCAL CONSTRUCTION NEED YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS INCREASE STATEWIDE ACCOUNT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE USE OF ALLOCATIONS. SAYING PRAYER WORKS HARD AND CRAFTING AND BETTING THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE. SO THAT THE INTEGRITY OF LOCAL PLANNING CONTROL ARE INTACT BUT ALSO ENSURES THAT BINDING ISSUES EACH YEAR AS INTENDED. I'M AWARE OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE ANOTHER BUT SHARED AND WANT TO POINT OUT. THAT THEY JUST CRIED NEGATIVE IMPACTS SHOULD ONLY COME TO FRUITION IF LOCAL CONSTRUCTION AREN'T FULFILLING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. I FUNDING OVERSIGHT AND DECISION MAKING. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO KATHLEEN PORTER. GOOD MORNING I'M- ORDER BUILDING CENTER. IN TALLY YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ADULT EDUCATION. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN NINETY ONE. CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM PROVIDES EIGHT THREE YEARS SPENDING WINDOW FOR ALLOCATIONS NOT BASED ON STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. TO CARRY OVER IS DEFINED AS FUNDS REMAINING AFTER THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD. AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE PROPOSES USING THE MORE COMMON CONCEPT OF CARRY OVER. THAT TIME TO ALLOCATED THE ANY GIVEN YEAR ARE FOR USE IN THAT YEAR. THIS DISTINCTION IS AN IMPORTANT ONE WHEN WE CONSIDER MAKING A DIFFERENCE TO CALIFORNIANS IN NEED OF ADULT EDUCATION SERVICES TODAY. WITH THREE YEAR DEFINITION CARRYOVER IS REPORTED TO BE BETWEEN FOUR AND TEN PERCENT. HOWEVER HUSING THE YEAR OVER YEAR MODEL PROPOSAL PROPOSED IN AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE CARRYOVER IS ESTIMATED TO BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION OR ALLOCATION. AND THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY AGENCIES CARRYING OVER MORE THAN A 100% OF THEIR ANNUAL ALLOCATION QUITE SIMPLY THIS MEANS THAT FUNDING IS NOT SERVING STUDENTS IN THOSE AREAS IN THE FISCAL YEAR. NEFL CLASS CUTS ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER YEAR AND SERVICE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY STUDENTS SO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION EQUATES TO FIFTY TWO HUNDRED MORE CLASSES. SERVING MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND STUDENTS STATEWIDE AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE PROVIDES LOCAL CONSORTIA THE TOOLS NEEDED TO MEET THE UNMET NEEDS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES EACH YEAR ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND THE STUDENTS WE SERVE. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO TO THE OPPOSITION. A WITNESSES FOR AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE A FIRST I HAVE- IT LOOKS LIKE MADELINE OUR BOTTLE IF I SAID THAT CORRECTLY AND THIS IS- THAT IS FOR OPPOSITION I ALSO HAVE A VALENTINA PURTELL. YEAH COUNTY NOT PERTINENT HERE GOING. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS VALENTINA PATEL AND I REPRESENTS NORTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND IT'S ALL FOR MY HONOR TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF NORTH ORANGE CONTINUING EDUCATION WHICH IS ONE OF THE THREE INSTITUTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND THE MAIN -VIDER OF ADULT EDUCATION IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY REGION. FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE ABOUT THAT PROVIDERS WORK CLOSELY AND COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR KEISTER TWELVE PARTNERS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL CONSORTIUM LEVELS. RELATED TO CALIFORNIA ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM. IN FACT WE HAD MULTIPLE MEETINGS WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DISAGREE ON SEVERAL TECHNICAL ASPECT OF THIS BILL. WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ABOUT THAT CONSORTIUM ESPECIALLY WORKING IN TWO COLLEGES ARE SERVICE PROVIDERS. THE PHYSICALLY 15% CAP IS NOT A REASONABLE THRESHOLD FOR CARRYOVER GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROGRAM AND A VARIETY OF PROVIDERS. SECOND ONE YEAR LIMITATION FOR THE SPENDING CYCLE WILL BE MISALIGNED WITH YOUR THREE YEAR PLANNING CYCLE. AND TOGETHER WITH THE 15% BLEND IT WOULD LEAD TO CARELESS SPENDING. AND FINALLY FOUND CONSORTIUM WOULD BE IN DANGER OF LOSING REGIONAL FUNDING DUE TO ACCUMULATION OF CARRYOVER BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO OUR CONCERNS. GREAT THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE IT'S MATALIN ARE FOLLOW IS STILL GOING TO TESTIFY. I'M HERE. THANK YOU COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS START HELLO YES PROCEED. THANK YOU COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FOR ALLOWING INPUT ON THIS BILL AND SUPPORT OF ADULT EDUCATION MY NAME IS MADELINE OUR VIOLENT PAST PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY AND CONTINUING EDUCATION A PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION OF MORE THAN FIFTY COMMUNITY COLLEGES I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE. THE THREE ORIGINAL PLAN THE CONSORTIA CREATE PROMOTE GOALS TO BE DEVELOPED OVER LONGER TIME FRAMES THAT NEED LONGER TIME TO EXPAND BUT NOT HARD FUNDS WE CAN THEN PLAN PROGRAMS FOR IMMEDIATE EMPLOYMENT A COLLEGE TRANSITION FOR EXAMPLE IF A SCHOOL SIX TO START ELECTED OFFICIAL NURSES PROGRAM. UNLESS COUNTY APPROVALS THAT MAY BE LONG TERM FOLLOW BY PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD TAKE MORE THAN A YEAR A MEMBER CONSENT CARRYOVER FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT THIS HUGELY IN DEMAND PROGRAM THAT IS THE CENTRAL AND BOTH A CRITICAL NEED IS AFFORDED THE TIME TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT. SUCCESS OF A PROGRAM CAN ALSO BE DEPENDENT ON THE TIME LINE AND FUTURE OUTCOMES MAY BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED I UNDERSTAND THE BILL ALLOWS FOR CONSORTIA TO KERRY OF WHAT THEY'RE SPECIFICALLY BY YES HOWEVER THE METHOD TO BECOME BUDGET PLAYED A- INTENT IS OPEN FOR NOW OUR INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION MEMBERS FUNDS. MAY BE LEFT VULNERABLE AND HAVE WE EVER EVEN STUDIED THE IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF SPENDING AT CERTAIN LEVELS EACH YEAR FIRST. BENDING OVER PLAN KIND. I THE GAME MADE IN THE- VALUED AT THE THAT PARTNERSHIP. CAN BE LEFT AND WITH THEM. OF THE CALL. WE AGREE THERE NEEDS TO BE ATTENTION PAID TO LESS CARRY AMOUNT. BUT THIS POLICY IS SIMPLE TO BRING IN P. IT IS THE- CHILE. CARRYOVER ABOUT THE TEN A STRUCTURED NON LEGISLATIVE TO. AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL. TO A BURST HOGAN AMOUNTS KERRY OF. AN APPROACH WITH. IS FEDERAL. AND WE'RE STILL OPEN TO SOLUTIONS OUTSIDE OF LEGISLATIVE FIXES. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF ADULT EDUCATION. THANK YOU- ANY QUESTION WHAT QUESTIONS ARE COMING FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL JUST- JUST MAKE A QUICK STATEMENT ON THIS IS YOUR MCCARTY. IF YOU SIT ON MONEY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS YOU INVITE A LEGISLATOR TO COME IN.

SERVER DAHLE SOY APPRECIATE- YOUR MISSION HERE WITH THAT MISTER BENNETT. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATED AND THE IDEA OF A RESERVES OF. HAS TO BE REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET THE EDUCATION OUT BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR. THAT- AFTER SAID HANDLING BUDGETS A NUMBER OF TIMES. IF THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A GOOD FACE ORGANIZATION SOMETHING HAPPENS AT THE LAST MINUTE SO MONEY HAS COME IN OR WHATEVER SO TO THE EXTENT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. YOU CAN BUILD WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE GOOD FAITH ORGANIZATION THAT. IS CAUGHT TEMPORARILY NEEDING TO GO OVER- IF- I JUST WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT- OUTSIDE OF THAT IS CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT- THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO AND LOOK WE'RE GONNA KEEP WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND- MAYBE IT'S NOT 15% MAYBE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS SOME IDEAS AS WELL BUT HAVING A 100% OF YOUR MONEY. LEFT LEFT OVER IS NOT OUR WILL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU'RE DEPRIVING THE COMMUNITY WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THESE. ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM SENSE OF THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND SO- BUT YEAH THANK YOU WE'LL KEEP WORKING AND FIND. AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION THANKS THANK.

THANK YOU MISTER CARLY I APPRECIATE THAT THIS SYSTEM THE SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN IS NOT PERFECT.

THE END OF THE ROOM TEN AROUND TEN OKAY AND THAT'LL KEEP TIME AND I HAVE A- THING TO SHOW YOU. IS THAT THE. THIS IS A AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT ALL. GREAT THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND BEFORE I START- JUST AS YOU AS I MAKE MY COMMENTS TODAY. WILL WELL LAY THEM OUT NO WAY MORAL WERE ALSO UP AND THIS. WHAT YOU WON'T HEAR ME SAY WHEN I SAY PROBLEMS IS. ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND SOLUTION SHUT THEM DOWN. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT- THIS BILL IS ABOUT. CREATING MORE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND EVEN INCREASING SOME AUDITS TO ENSURE THAT. STUDENTS ARE SUCCEEDING AND PUBLIC MONEY IS SPENT WISELY THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AGAIN- JUST FOR AN EDITORIAL THINK ONLINE LEARNING IS NOT GOING AWAY I THINK WE LEARNED THAT EVEN MORE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN REAL SUCCESSFUL QUITE FRANKLY. I THINK WE WERE ALL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT FOR SOME STUDENTS IT MAY BE SUCCESSFUL AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS KIND OF BRING IT IN TO THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE CREATE SOME. SOME GOOD GOVERNMENT PRACTICES AROUND IT. AND MOVE FORWARD. SO WITH THAT- MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY SEEKS TO DO THREE THINGS ENSURE ALL CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO A QUALITY EDUCATION. WHETHER IT BE A TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR SCHOOL OR AN ONLINE SCHOOL. TO PROTECT PUBLIC MONEY THROUGH GOOD GOVERNMENT POLICIES SUCH AS AUDITS TRANSPARENCY AND STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY PRACTICES FOR ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS. JUST AS THEY ARE FOR TRADITIONAL SCHOOL OPERATIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES BETTER STEWARDS OF PUBLIC MONEY. ALSO TO STOP THE WELL DOCUMENTED FRAUD AMONG MANY NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION STUDENTS RECEIVE IN THE SCHOOLS. BY ENSURING THAT THE MONEY THEY RECEIVE IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. NOT TO LINE THE POCKETS OF THOSE WHO WISH TO STEAL. PUBLIC MONEY WHICH IN SOME CASES WE HAVE SEEN. I AM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT AN IN PERSON EDUCATION SETTING SERVE STUDENTS BEST. BUT FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT SOME STUDENTS DO THRIVE IN AN ONLINE SETTING AND WE WILL OFFER YOU THIS ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IN CALIFORNIA. AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO SHUT DOWN ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS BILL IS NOT FOR YOU IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THEM THIS BILL IS FOR YOU. I BELIEVE ONLINE LEARNING IS NOT GOING AWAY AND I AM NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATED BUT WE MUST FORTIFY IT WITH EXPECTATIONS OF QUALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND GET RID OF THE FRAUD THAT HAS BEEN LONG ASSOCIATED. WITH THIS TYPE OF LEARNING. THE FACT IS THAT THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO CHARTER SCHOOL LEVEL NEVER COME BLOOD THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO CHARTER SCHOOL LAW NEVER CONTEMPLATED ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS. SO THERE'S RELATIVELY MINIMAL STATUTORY GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT OF THIS TYPE OF SCHOOLING JUST AS IN A LOT OF LAW OUT THERE. PEOPLE OF TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE- IT IS TIME TO END THE WILD WEST PROVIDE TRUE OVERSIGHT STOP THE FRAUD AND ALL OF THE NEGATIVE HYPE AND SCANDALS ASSOCIATED WITH HIS THIS APPROACH TO LEARNING. SO ISSUE NUMBER ONE FRAUD OR THEFT OF PUBLIC MONEY BY MANIPULATING OR DOCTORING STUDENT ATTENDANCE DATA THIS IS HAPPENING HOW DO WE ADDRESS IT WE FORTIFY THE STATUTES THAT SPEAK TO SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF FRAUD WITHIN SIGHT THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF FRAUD ACROSS OUR STATE. TODAY WE WILL SHARE ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR FROM SAN DIEGO. THIS EXAMPLE WILL BE SHARED BY THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THIS FRAUD WAS PROMULGATED BY THE NOW DEFUNCT EIGHT THREE CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORK WHICH DEFRAUDED TAXPAYERS VENTURE OLDER BY STEALING THE IDENTITIES OF LITTLE LEAGUE PLAYERS IN ORDER TO BUILD THE STATE. FOR EDUCATION THEY NEVER PROVIDED. THIS CHARTER NETWORK USED EACH CHILD'S INFORMATION TOOL ROLL THEM IN THEIR CHARTER SCHOOLS OVER THE SUMMER. THE CHARTER SCHOOL NEVER PROVIDED ANY INSTRUCTION TO THESE CHILDREN. IN FACT THE PARENTS HAD NO IDEA THEIR CHILDREN WERE EVER ENROLLED. IN A CHARTER SCHOOL. YET THEY COLLECTED ATTENDANCE FUNDING FROM THE STATE FOR THOSE CHILDREN AS THOUGH THEY DID ATTEND THAT SCHOOL. THE A. THREE CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORK USED ANOTHER SCHEME TO COLLECT EVEN MORE FUNDING. THEY MOVE STUDENTS BETWEEN THEIR SCHOOLS AND MANIPULATED THEIR CALENDAR USING MULTI TRACK YEAR ROUND SCHEDULING. TO DRAW DOWN FAR MORE. THAN ONCE ONE SCHOOL YEAR OF ATTENDANCE FUNDING PER STUDENT. AT ONE POINT THE- SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE DEFENDING SOMEBODY INDIVIDUALS IN A THREE I SAW THIS AND IN THE MEDIA. AS I RECALL THEY DEFENDED WHAT THEY DID WAS LEGAL BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAW THAT SAID IT WASN'T LEGAL. SO WE NEED TO CLOSE THIS GAP. WITH THIS BILL WE WILL CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES AND THIS TYPE OF FRAUD THE EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE TYPE OF FRAUD AND OTHER TYPES OF FRAUD BY ENDING THE USE OF MULTI TRACK YEAR ROUND SCHEDULE FOR BOTH DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS UNLESS THEY TRULY HAVE. FACILITY CHALLENGES. IMPROVING CHARTER AUTHORIZER OVERSIGHT OF CHARTER SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. ESTABLISHING TRAINING FOR BOTH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOL AUDITORS AND REQUIRING AUDITORS O LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT STUDENT ATTENDANCE. PROHIBITING PRIVATE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS OR SCHOOLS FROM SERVING AS VENDORS AT CHARTER SCHOOLS. REQUIRING A STUDY TO CONNECT THE CAL PADS SYSTEM TO THE ATTENDANCE FUNDING SYSTEM. AND WE WILL HAVE MICHAEL FLYING HERE FROM THICK MAT WHO SPECIFY THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT WE NEED TO SEE WHAT STUDENTS ARE WHERE SO THEY'RE NOT GETTING COUNTED INC IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES AT ONCE AGAIN FUNDING. A TWO DIFFERENT SCHOOL SYSTEMS AT ONCE THIS BILL ALSO CREATES AN INSPECTOR GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE FRAUD AND ABUSE IN ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATION ACROSS OUR STATE AND AGAIN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WOULD NOT SOLELY FOCUS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS NOT WOULD BE FOR ALL. SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIANS NEED. ISSUE NUMBER TWO. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ONLINE EDUCATION IS FOCUSED ON STUDENT SUCCESS. HOW DO WE ADDRESS IT WOULD BOLSTER TEACHER AND STUDENT ACCOUNT OF THE- WE BOLSTER STUDENT TEACHER. AND STUDENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS. THE QUALITY AND OUTCOMES OF INDEPENDENT STUDY AT NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS NEEDS TO IMPROVE. STUDIES BY THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON STANFORD AND VANDERBILT ALL SHOW THAT STUDENTS AN ONLINE SCHOOL SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERPERFORM ACADEMICALLY COMPARED TO STUDENTS TAUGHT IN TRADITIONAL CLASSROOMS. THE STANFORD STUDY SHOWED THAT STUDENTS AND NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS MADE SO LITTLE PROGRESS IN MATH THAT WAS AS IF THE STUDENTS HAD NOT ATTENDED SCHOOL FOR AN ENTIRE. YEAR THE DATA IS CLEAR MANY STUDENTS THAT ATTEND AN ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL PERFORMED POORLY. STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN THIS THE STATE HAS AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY BOLSTERING TEACHER AND STUDENT ACCOUNTABILITY. CURRENTLY TEACHERS AN INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS HAVE NO MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR HOW OFTEN THEY INTERACT. WITH THEIR STUDENTS. THEY COULD SEE THEM AS LITTLE AS ONCE PER SEMESTER. GIVEN THAT THE TYPICAL ONLINE SCHOOL STUDENT IS NOT PERFORMING AT GRADE LEVEL THIS IS AN ATROCITY. THIS PRESS STICKS THIS PRACTICE CANNOT BE DEFENDED. STUDENTS ARE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN RECEIVING A SUB PAR EDUCATION. SOME STUDENTS IN THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVE INSTRUCTION FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CREDENTIAL. IT IS POSSIBLE THEY HAVE NO HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR COLLEGE EDUCATION. THEY OFTEN HAVE NOT EVEN PASSED A STATE LEVEL BACKGROUND CHECKS. THIS RAISES SERIOUS SKILL SET AND SAFETY CONCERNS FOR OUR STUDENTS. AN ONLINE SCHOOL VENDOR COULD BE TEACHING MATH WITH NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOPIC NOR HOW TO TEACH IT. AN ONLINE SCHOOL VENDOR COULD HAVE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND BUT WITH NO BACKGROUND CHECKS. WHO WOULD KNOW. WITH THIS BILL WE SUIT TO ADDRESS THE QUALITY OF INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS IN BOTH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. BY ESTABLISHING A MINIMUM FREQUENCY OF TEACHER AND STUDENT INTERACTION. REQUIRING VENDORS TO HAVE A CREDENTIAL. IF THEY'RE SERVICES COUNT TOWARD INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES THIS PROVIDES PARITY WITH ALL OTHER CHARTER SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TODAY. ESTABLISHING A MINIMUM SCHOOL DAY FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS IS PERRY. REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO HAVE AN IN PERSON OPTION TO SERVE SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AND STRUGGLING STUDENTS WHO NEED AND PERSON INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT. YOU SUCCEED. ESTABLISHING METRICS FOR ENDING A STUDENTS INDEPENDENT STUDY AGREEMENT WHEN THE SCHOOL IS NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS AGAIN THAT'S FOR CHARTER AND TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS. LET ME WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL. OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT WE DID NOT GAUGED ENGAGE THEM AND WRITING THIS BILL THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE MY STAFF HAD. SEVERAL. AND MEETINGS WERE HELD WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS IN FACT WE ASK THE CHARTER COMMUNITY FOR THEIR IDEAS ON HOW TO STOP THIS FRAUD THEY CAME UP WITH NEARLY NOTHING ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE THEFT OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS NOR PATH TO ENSURING ATTIC ACADEMIC SUCCESS. FOR ONLINE. SCHOOL STUDENTS. THIS BILL IS THE RESULT OF YEARS OF OBSERVATION AND DISCUSSION AND RECOGNITION THAT THE ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL ARENA IS RIFE WITH FRAUD. A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND POOR ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. OPPONENTS OF THE BILL WILL ARGUE THAT THE BILL IS REALLY AN EFFORT TO STOP HER CLOTHES ONLINE SCHOOLS AND LIMIT PARENTS CHOICES. THIS BILL WILL NOT CLOSE A SINGLE CHARTER SCHOOL. LET ME REPEAT REPEAT THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE CLOSURE OF A SINGLE ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL. IN FACT THIS BILL STRENGTHENS PARENT CHOICE BY MAKING NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS MORE ACCOUNTABLE TRANSPARENT AND OF HIGHER QUALITY. THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS INEQUITABLE ALL PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A PRUDENT TO A CREDENTIALED AND BACKGROUND CHECK TEACHER. STUDENTS AND NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS ARE NOT BEING GIVEN ACCESS TO CREDENTIALED TEACHERS IN THEIR CORE. AND NON CORE INSTRUCTION. FURTHER SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS TO ENSURE STUDENT SAFETY. OPPONENTS HAVE ARGUED THAT THIS BILL MAKES DRACONIAN CUTS. THE TRUTH IS FOR EARLY BIRD FULLY VIRTUAL SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE BROOKE AND MORTAR BUILDINGS TO PAY FOR. NOR DO THEY HAVE OR NEED THE PERSONAL THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OPERATE. THOSE BUILDINGS. THE FUNDING FORMULA IN THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE LESS FUNDING TO FULLY VIRTUAL PROGRAMS AND MORE STATE FUNDING TO PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE A HYBRID MODEL SINCE THESE PROGRAMS COST MORE TO OPERATE IF YOU HAVE A BUILDING. YOU HAVE AN OFFICE MANAGER YOU HAVE A JANITOR. WHOMEVER YOU HAVE WORKING ON THAT SITE COSTS MORE MONEY THAN IT WOULD FOR AN ONLINE SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T HAVE FACILITIES TO FACILITIES COST MONEY. OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS BILL IS TOO BURDENSOME TO THE ABSENT TO THE UPSTANDING CHARTER SCHOOLS DUE TO A SINGLE BAD ACTOR. THE FRAUD PERPETUATED BY NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS GOES FAR BEYOND THE A. THREE CHARTER CASE. FRAUD HAS BEEN ALLEGED EIGHT THREE VALIANT INSPIRE KAVA EPIC TRI VALLEY MAGNOLIA INSULARITY THERE ARE MORE. OTHER STATES ARE ALSO SEEING POOR ALKYD OTHER STATES ARE ALSO SEEN POOR ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AND FRAUD RELATED TO NON CLASSROOMBASED CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEY ARE TAKING ACTION. WE MUST DO THE SAME. OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS BILL BREAKS THE AGREEMENT ON AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE NOT AT ALL THE TRUTH IS THAT AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE CREATED A TWO YEAR MORATORIUM ON THESE TOUGH ON THESE SCHOOLS PRECISELY SO THAT WE COULD STUDY THEM AND BRING FORWARD REFORMS BEFORE THE MORATORIUM. EXPIRED THE PLAN WAS ALWAYS TO COME BACK WITH REFORMS AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. AS WE STUDIED NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS AND IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS WE CREATED SOLUTIONS TO STOP THE POTENTIAL FRAUD AND ALL PUBLIC SCHOOL SETTINGS. THAT IS WHY PARTS OF THIS BILL APPLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS CHARTER SCHOOLS. WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER. OPPONENTS WILL TO OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT WE ONLY NEED TO BEEF UP AUDITING TO STOP THIS FRAUD NOW WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE. ASK ANY AUDITOR. AS MR FINE WILL BE UP HERE SHORTLY FROM THE FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM WHEN HE TESTIFIES AND HE WILL TELL YOU THAT AUDIENCE AUDITING ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT THE BILL AND STUDENT FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHEN THEY CAN COMPLETE THE WORK. THAT'S FALSE THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY WILL CLARIFY THAT THE EXISTING CD REGULATIONS WILL BE REWORKED AND REWRITTEN STUDENTS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS WILL HAVE THE SAME FLEXIBILITY AS INDEPENDENT STUDENTS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS I THINK THAT PROBABLY PERTAINS TO A PARENT WHO MIGHT HAVE A CHILD THAT IS IN SPORTS AND MIGHT. BE PERFORMING THAT SPORT DURING TO THEIR PRACTICING THAT SPORT AND THEY MIGHT NEED TO COMPLETE THEIR INSTRUCTION AND SOME NONTRADITIONAL HOURS OVERSTAYING A SERVICE WE SEEK TO ACCOMMODATE THAT WE SEEK TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO. OPPONENTS OF THE BILL WILL TELL YOU THAT THEIR STUDENT PERFORMANCES LOWER BECAUSE THEY SERVE AT RISK STUDENTS. NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS DO NOT SERVICE STUDENT BODY THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF OUR STATE. THEY SERVE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER AT RISK STUDENTS INCLUDING LOW INCOME. AN ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS. AND ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH STUDENTS AND ONLINE SCHOOLS UNDER PERFORMANCE EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP. COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS IN CLASSROOM BASED SCHOOLS. OPPONENTS WILL SAY THAT SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT PROBLEMATIC AUTHORIZERS. THE TRUTH IS THESE DISTRICTS ARE SO SMALL THAT THE SUPERINTENDENTS ARE BOTH THE BUS DRIVERS AND THE MATH TEACHERS IN A FEW DISTRICTS THE NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS THEY OVERSEE IS FAR GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ROMAN. FOR EXAMPLE. A SCHOOL DISTRICT WHAT TWENTY TWO STUDENTS. HAS AUTHORIZED. IT HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED- FOR A FORTY FIVE HUNDRED STE 440-500-4440 FIVE HUNDRED. A STUDENT CHARTER SCHOOLS IN OTHER WORDS A SCHOOL DISCUSS TWENTY TWO STUDENTS. IS OVERSEEING A CHART OF THOSE FORTY FIVE. HUNDRED STUDENTS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO OVERSEE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IF YOU ONLY HAVE TWENTY TWO. STUDENTS IN YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. I DISTRICT WITH A THOUSAND ADA HAS AUTHORIZED THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CHARTER SCHOOL ADA. I THINK OF THE SAN DIEGO A THREE CASE OF I REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD CORRECTLY. THEY HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY STUDENTS IN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT. YET THEY HAD AUTHORIZED A CHARTER TO HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THEY COULDN'T OVERSEE THEM THAT'S HOW THAT'LL THREE THAT'S- PART OF THE REASON ONE OF THE REASONS ONLY.THAT THE WHOLE A THREE SCENARIO HAPPEN. SO IN CLOSING. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. RECEIVE LETTERS FROM PARENTS SUGGESTING THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON AUDITING REFORMS AND REFORMS TO INDEPENDENT STUDY. WE AGREE. THIS BILL DOES BOTH. THE LEGISLATURE MUST CLEAN UP THE LAWN CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC EDUCATION TO BENEFIT ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. AND WITH ME TODAY IS ONE OF THE JOINT AUTHORS OF THE BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA. AT THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK THAT FOR WORKING ON THIS. I THE PUBLIC GOT TO KNOW ME THROUGH BATH THEN THE CITY OF ALL FIGHTING CORRUPTION. AND IN MY NINE YEARS HERE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF AUDITS IN THAT AREA IN MY AREA KEEPS BEING THE CORE THERE ARE CORRUPTION A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS WE SAW. TEN YEARS AGO ELEVEN YEARS AGO IN THE CITY ABOUT HAPPENING IN NEIGHBORING CITIES BECAUSE AN AUDIT IS NOT ENOUGH TRANSALTA NEW SCANDAL AND TEN PEOPLE GOING TO JAIL WITH ENOUGH EITHER TO THE TURN OTHER PEOPLE FROM FOLLOWING THE SAME BAD PRACTICES OUT THERE. ARE AND SO I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THESE ISSUES FOR AWHILE AND SAN DIEGO AND IT BEEN APPALLED BY ABUSE THAT WE HAVE SEEN BY EIGHT THIRTY AND OTHERS ARE AND ALSO BEEN UP ALL OF THE MEMBER REPRESENTS A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY OF COLOR. WHERE STUDENTS ARE NOT YOU SEEN TAX DOLLARS TO GO TO DISNEYLAND- AND I HAVE BEEN TO THE HARD TIME EVEN PAYING FOR BASIC THINGS LIKE PAPER AND PENCILS- AND SO FORTH TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE THIS IN EQUITY IT'S PARTICULARLY HARD FOR ME ONLINE SCHOOLS ARE HERE THEY'RE HERE TO STAY WE KNOW THAT- BEFORE THE PANDEMIC IN THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE THAT CLEAR. BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE TO STAY AND BECAUSE THEY ARE GROWING I THINK IT'S EVER MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE ACTION NOW TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S EQUITABLE ACCOUNTABLE AND TRANSPARENT AND FAIR TO ALL THE TAXPAYERS OUT THERE WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN. SIXTEEN I HAVE MORE COMMENTS BUT I WILL NEVER OUR LEAD UP TO HEAR ME THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF TALKING ABOUT THE BILL AND ADDRESSING SOME ISSUES I WILL BE HERE I TO ENSURE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME THAT WE PROTECT THE PARENTS RIGHT TO HOME SCHOOL THEIR CHILD OF THAT THEIR- CHOICE AND THIS BILL STILL PRESERVES THAT. BUT IT HAS TO BE IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT AFFECT OR IS THAT THE GERMAN OTHER STUDENTS IN OUR STATE THIS BILL THE SERVICE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO STUDENTS ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY ANALYST QUALITY THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND FASHION BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS. OUT THERE WE WILL BE HEARING FROM THE ONSHORE FROM THE SENEGAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND MIKE FIND FROM THINK MATT THAT I HERE TO TESTIFY AND. ALSO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS I WAS THE IF WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ARE BELIEVE THE% FOR WITNESS WE ARE SURE HERE IN THE- YOU MAY PROCEED ON ANY. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS THE ON SHORE I'M A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND RUN THE PUBLIC INTEGRITY DIVISION OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. PROSECUTING INDIVIDUALS WHO STEAL PUBLIC FUNDS OUR GOAL IS TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT GAPS IN THE SYSTEM THAT LED TO A CASE OF MASSIVE FRAUD TO DATE WE HAVE RECOVERED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION EDUCATION DOLLARS. WE WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR OUR OFFICE SUPPORTS LEGALLY RUN CHARTER SCHOOLS THEY CAN BE A GREAT OPTION FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS HOWEVER SEEING THE CONTINUED THREAT TO EDUCATION DOLLARS BEING DIVERTED FROM KIDS WE PRESENTED OUR FINDINGS TO THE CD AND ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE WE HIGHLIGHTED. GLARING PROBLEMS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THICK MAT SPECIFICALLY BASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS IN THE MASSIVE FRAUD THERE ARE LARGE GAPS IN THE STATE'S OVERSIGHT OUR PROSECUTION IS ONGOING AND FOR THAT REASON WE CANNOT SPEAK TO MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF THE CASE ADDITIONALLY WE WANT TO STAY IN OUR LANE OF PUBLIC SAFETY. SIMPLY POINTING OUT WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS VULNERABLE TO FRAUD THE STATE DOES NOT% MONITOR THE MONEY THAT GOES FOR EACH STUDENT'S EDUCATION. GOVERNMENT REGULATORS RELY ON AUDITORS TO CONFIRM THE ACCURACY OF ATTENDANCE AND EXPENDITURES OF PUBLIC SCHOOL. AT ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS THE AUDITORS WORK IN AND HALF WILL CAPACITY LACK THE TOOLS KNOWLEDGE AND AUTHORITY TO FIND FRAUD. IF IT IS A CURRENT. GOVERNMENT REGULATORS DO NOT MONITOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENT ATTENDANCE AT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND ARE CURRENTLY PAYING OUT MORE THAN ONE EIGHTY A PER STUDENT IN MANY CASES WITHOUT KNOWING THAT% THEY'RE DOING SO. THE CDC HAS NO AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL FRAUD AND NEEDS THE ABILITY TO DO SO ONLY A RARE DA'S OFFICE HAS THE RESOURCES TO DO SO. OUR OFFICE ONLY WANTS TO PROMOTE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY THAT PREVENTS FRAUD. PROTECTS TAXPAYERS AND SUPPORTS EDUCATION OUR EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US THAT WHEN OVERSIGHT IS LAX FRAUD WILL FLOURISH WHEN FRAUD OCCURS IN THE AREA OF PUBLIC FUNDING OF EDUCATION OUR SCHOOLS LOSE OUR PARENTS LOSE. OUR STUDENTS THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO MISTER FINE MIST CHARACTER JUST LAST QUESTION OF THE DISTRIBUTOR- THE IT GIVES QUICK OTHERWISE WE'VE DORM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASK QUESTIONS DOUBLES UP THE MIKE THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU UP. YOUR EXPERIENCE DO YOU SENSE OF THE FRAUD GOES BEYOND A THREE THAT'S THAT'S MY QUESTION YES. GREAT I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF THANK YOU. AND NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM MICHAEL FINE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING TO YOU AYE MICHAEL FIND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE STATE'S FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM I WAS FACT MAPS PLEASURE TO SERVICE TECHNICAL ADVISORS TO THE AUTHORS. IN CONSIDERING SEVERAL OF THE TOPICS THAT ARE DRESSED IN- THE BILL BEFORE YOU AFFECT MAP HAS BEEN CALLED UPON TO AUDIT. OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN INVESTIGATIONS OF SEVERAL NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS OVER THE YEARS AS SUCH WE HAVE BUILDING UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERTISE ON A VARIETY OF THE TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU. I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS- FIRST THE TOPIC OF AUDIT QUALITY- IN DEVIATING FROM MY WRITTEN COMMENTS JUST BRIEFLY GIVEN THE- THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER THAT. IT IS THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL OR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THAT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY- FOR CONDUCTING THEIR BUSINESS- IN A LEGAL WAY AND- IN A TRANSPARENT WAY- IN A WAY THAT. COMPLIES WITH WITH OUR REGULATIONS IN THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE. IT'S NOT THE AUDITOR'S JOB TO DO THAT- AUDITORS ARE FAIRLY LIMITED IN THE WORK IN THE SCOPE THAT THEY DO TO PRODUCE AN ANNUAL. FINANCIAL AUDIT THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO PRODUCE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO THAT ENTITY WHETHER THAT'S A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR COUNTY. SUPERINTENDENT OR- A CHARTER SCHOOL. SECTIONS OF A ONE TWO EIGHT THROUGH ELEVEN. TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SIX OF THE BILL DEAL WITH THE TOPIC- OF AUDITS AND RECOMMEND AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING PROVISIONS. THAT WOULD INCREASE AUDIT CONSISTENCY AND QUALITY FOR ALL. OF LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. SECTIONS TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SIX SPECIFICALLY DEAL WITH CHANGES TO CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT BRING THE AUDIT PROCESS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS IN ALIGNMENT WITH. A SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. THE BILL PROPOSED MAKES COMMONSENSE CHANGES IT'S NOT AN OVER REACH BY ANY MEANS- AND AGAIN AT THE LINES- OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR ALL LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WHETHER THEY ARE. A GOVERNMENT ENTITIES SUCH AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. OR THEIR PRIVATE. ENTITIES SUCH AS A CHARTER SCHOOL. THERE ARE THREE BASIC TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE SECTIONS ON AUDIT FIRST AS AUDITOR TRAINING- TO. SPECIFIC TO AUDITORS TO CONDUCT AUDITS OF- LGAS- WE ADDRESS THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF EXISTING CPA LICENSURE- IN CONTINUING AT REQUIREMENTS WE DON'T GO OUTSIDE THAT EXISTING STRUCTURE- AUDIT FIRM PEER REVIEW LIKEWISE USING THE EXISTING STRUCTURE THAT'S IN PLACE. SET BY THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY HERE IN CALIFORNIA- WE WORK WITHIN THEIR AUTHORIZED MR FINE SURE DO TIME THANK YOU. I THINK THAT WAS ASKED ALSO A TODAY BY COMMITTEE STAFF TO SPEAK TO- FUNDS THAT ARE GIVEN BY CHARTER SCHOOLS TO PARENTS. OF FROM THE FROM THEIR ALLOCATION THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND WHAT THOSE ARE USED FOR- LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF THOSE IN ONE CHARTER SCHOOLS CASE ONE NETWORKS CASE THEY HAVE SEVEN THOUSAND VENDORS THAT THE PARENTS CAN PICK FROM TO DELIVER SERVICE SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL MUSIC LESSONS. HORSEBACK RIDING CROSSFIT MEMBERSHIP GOLF RESORT SERVICES ANIMAL CARE MARTIAL ARTS GYMNASTICS AS AN EXAMPLE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WILL NOW GO TO- OPPOSITION WITNESSES. AND WE HAVE- ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WE HAVE- CAST JUNE FROM- THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION IN CAPE FOR BOARD PRESENT SANTA BARBARA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. GOOD MORNING I MEAN THE CUSTOMER WHO AND THEN THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION HERE TO REPRESENT THE CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITY STRENUOUS OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN. CCSA HAS A VERY STRONG RECORD AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE BLEW THE WHISTLE ON THE CRIMINALS OF THE A. THREE SCHEME IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND CALLED ON THE CD IS SUPERINTENDENT TO INVESTIGATE AND TAKE APPROPRIATE AND IMMEDIATE ACTION. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY IN NORRIS SAID ABOUT PARITY. THE BILL LACKEY LEAD ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST CHARTER STUDENTS BY SLASHING NON CLASSROOM BASED FUNDING BY 30% BUT NOT FOR DISTRICTS WITH INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS. AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN ALSO FALLS FAR SHORT OF HOLDING AUTHORIZERS ACCOUNTABLE AS YOU JUST HEARD MISTER FIND YOU SPEAK TO THAT. IN FACT IT ACTUALLY DOUBLES DOWN ON THE FIRST PERSON SENTENCED OF INCREASED OVERSIGHT FEES WHICH WE KNOW THAT MOTIVATED UNSCRUPULOUS AUTHORIZERS IN THE PAST. MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL ELIMINATES STUDENT CENTERED FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES IN THE DISCRETION NECESSARY FOR TEACHERS IMPAIR PROFESSIONALS TO MEET STUDENT NEEDS. FURTHER AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN UNRAVELS THAT HISTORIC COMPROMISE SHEPHERDED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. I RELIVE THE GETTING SETTLED ISSUES RELATED TO SITE BASED SCHOOLS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE REGULATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW LAWS. HAVE NOT EVEN YET BEEN INITIATED. HOW CAN WE FULLY ENGAGE A WIN RECENT LEGISLATIVE AGREEMENTS ARE BEING DISMISSED AND PUNITIVE APPROACHES AGAINST AN ENTIRE SECTOR ARE BEING INVEST IN THIS BILL. THIS BILL TARGETS FAMILIES WHO'VE BEEN FAILED BY SITE BASED SETTINGS THESE CHARTERS DO SERVE A HIGHLY MOBILE STUDENT POPULATION UP TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT. WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT A FRACTION OF THE WHOLE STUDENT BODY OF CALIFORNIA LESS THAN THREE PERCENT. THE FOR THE PREGNANT OR THE WORKING TEAM OR THE MIGRANT STUDENT WHO FOLLOWS THE CROPS WITH THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO HAVE FLOCKED TO PERSONALIZE LEARNING PROGRAMS IN THE PANDEMIC. AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN WILL STRAIN AND EVEN FOR CLOTHES OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STUDENTS TO RECEIVE THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. THESE ARE OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS THIS IS NOT EQUITY AND THIS IS NOT CALIFORNIA WE RESPECTFULLY ASKED FOR YOU KNOW VOTE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU A TWO HOUR WAIT NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'M KATE FORD AND I'M CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE SANTA BARBARA UNIFIED SCHOOL BOARD AFTER FORTY THREE YEARS IN EDUCATION I BELIEVE THAT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OVERSEEING ELEVEN CHARGE BOTH AND NOW OF THE AUTHORIZER IN MY ROLE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. MY PERSPECTIVE MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO THE OVER REACH EXHIBITED IN AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN MY EXPERIENCE BOTH IN LOS ANGELES AND HERE IN SANTA BARBARA IS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEMS IN PLACE NO NOT PERFECT OUR COMPREHENSIVE TIME INTENSIVE AND HELPFUL TO BOTH THE CHARGERS OF THE AUTHORIZER. I SUPPORT REGULATIONS ARE PROCESSES THAT PREVENT SITUATIONS LIKE THE REPREHENSIBLE EIGHT THREE FRAUD IN SAN DIEGO BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH AND SEE BE CHARGED WITH THAT THEY FELL OF SPECIFIC NEEDS HAVE VERY STRONG PARENTS AND TEACHERS SUPPORT ARE WELL MANAGED AND HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR AUDITORS AND AUTHORIZE THE DISTRICT. EVEN BIGGER PICTURE IS THAT AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OPERATE CHARTERS PUBLIC SCHOOL AND THIS KIND OF BROAD STROKE IS SIMPLY DESTRUCTIVE IT'S NOTABLE THAT THE SMALL GROUP OF SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. DOESN'T INCLUDE THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS NOT DOES IT INCLUDE THE THOUSANDS OF PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO CHARTERS I THINK THAT'S QUITE TELLING. BY LAW NO CHILD SHOULD BE FORCED. TO ATTEND A CHARTER SCHOOL. AB THIRD SIX. IS THE BEST KEPT SECRET CHARTERS. WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS REDUCE. AND NEWER. THAT WOULD MAKE THE VERY FABRIC OF. I NEED THE VISION FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE R. THIRTEEN HUNDRED CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT MIRED IN FRAUD AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS SUCH. INSTEAD WHY NOT WORK TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN THE SUPPORT AND OVERSIGHT FOR AUTHORIZES IN CHARTERS ALIKE. OF ETHNIC PONDERED THE FIFTY THOUSAND CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ARE WELL SERVED THAT MUST BE THE CALL AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN DOES NOT DO THAT. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO ON AB. THIRTEEN SIXTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR- WE WILL NOW GO TO- COMMITTEE MEMBER QUESTIONS. I HAVE I HAVE FROM. I HOPE THAT YOU OWN THOSE THREE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AS I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS I DO WANT TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT I HAVE- SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND SING THIS BILL TALKING TO BOTH SIDES I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS TRYING TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE STATEMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD. I DO HAVE THIS IS A MAJOR BILL WITH MANY MANY COMPONENTS AS WE'VE ALL SEEN I WOULD SAY THAT TO US JUST FROM SEEING LEGISLATION NOW THIS GOING INTO MY SEVENTH YEAR I WOULD OF LIKE TO SEE THIS PUT IT INTO SEVERAL BILLS AS IT'S REALLY ADDRESSING MANY MANY ISSUES THAT BEING SAID IF SOMEONE BILL- BUT I WILL START WITH I'VE HEARD THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE. ON INTER ACTION BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION AND THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE SEEN A RECORD OF MANY MANY MEETINGS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE JANUARY SO AGAIN I'M TRYING TO STATE FOR THE RECORD A SOME OF THE MAJOR THINGS I'VE HEARD AS YOU KNOW THERE'S TWO SIDES TO AN ISSUE AND SOMETIMES WE GET A ONE PERSPECTIVE AND YET THERE IS ANOTHER AND SOMETIMES THE TRUTH LIES IN THE MIDDLE- SO I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL MEETINGS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE JANUARY RELATED TO THIS. SOME OF MY MAJOR QUESTION THREE WILL REVOLVE AROUND THE 30% AND SO I'M GOING TO ADDRESS THIS TO EITHER- EITHER AUTHOR OR EVEN ONE OF OUR WITNESSES HERE THAT THIS 30% WILL IN FACT A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS OUT OF BUSINESS AND AGAIN RELATED THE ADA SO I WOULD JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE IF SOMEBODY CAN EXPLAIN. EXACTLY WHAT IS IMPLIED BY. THAT SO ON ADA THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION AND THE 30% REDUCTION I'D SO I'LL BE ANSWERING QUESTIONS- FOR THE COMMITTEE AND I WILL BE ASKING SOME OF OUR WITNESSES TO DO BACK UP ON ON SOME OF **** AND OUR OTHER AUTHORS CHINA- SO WE HAVE AT LEAST FIVE OTHER STATES THAT ARE REDUCE FUNDING FOR VIRTUAL SCHOOLS AND THEY HAVE TO SHUT DOWN ANY OF THE SCHOOLS. IN THOSE STATES AS WELL AS WE HEARD FROM OUR LEAD AUTHOR OR YOU'RE- THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME CLASS OF BRICK AND MORTAR OR WITH ADDITIONAL STAFF LIKE CUSTODIANS AND SO FORTH. AND SO. NOT NOT CARE THAT THEY NEED THAT ADDITIONAL- THAT THAT EXTRA 30% THERE. SO THEY TYPICALLY A SCHOOL WOULD BE FUNDED ON EIGHTY EIGHT PER STUDENT AND THAT PER STUDENT IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL WOULD BE A 100% AS THEY ATTENDED IN CLASSROOM SCHOOL. THAT NOT ONLY PAYS FOR OF COURSE YOUR CREDENTIALED TEACHERS YOUR ADMINISTRATION YOUR CUSTODIAN SHORE UP ALL PARA PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE ON THE STAFF. IF THE STUDENT IS NOW ATTENDING A NON. IN PERSON CLASSROOM WITH OUT A PHYSICAL SPACE. THEN THE POINT OF THIS- ALTER THE ALTERATION IN THIS BILL WOULD TO SAY THEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE GETTING A 100% OF ADD A. D. A. AS THERE IS NOT A BRICK AND MORTAR. LOCATION THAT THEY NEED TO USE THAT ADDITIONAL 30% FOR IS THAT PRETTY MUCH THAT THAT SUMMER ACT. ALL RIGHT SO THEN THE NEXT QUESTION I AM VOTERS IF I COULD ADD ONE MORE THING SEVENTY SCHOOLS ARE SPENDING THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT THEY'RE GIVING TO PARENTS AT THAT THE THREATENS TO SPEND HOWEVER THEY WANT- A YEAR SEEN THINGS LIKE- FOR PAYING FOR. EQUESTRIAN CLASSES THEY'RE PLAYING FOR TRIPS TO THE LEVEL AND WE HAD A FAMILY GO TO CHICAGO I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME OVERHEAD AND DID NOT HAVE THE SAME MONEY SO THEY COULD AFFORD TO DO SOMETHING- THAT WE CAN DO IN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS ARE BRICK AND MORTAR SCHOOLS. I THINK MY FRIENDS IN MY DISTRICT WOULD GLADLY TAKE THE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY FOR BASIC THINGS THAT THEIR STUDENTS. NEEDS BUT THAT'S NOT OFFERED TO THEM. MMHM THANK YOU THEN THE NEXT AREA GARCIA. IT JUST. TWO POINTS OF THE UP RIGHT NOW THAT FOR ME IS ACTUALLY BUILT IN THE CURRENT LAW JUST AS A CURRENT PRACTICE FOR THE MOST PART. THE AT THE INSIDE THE ANALYSIS HERE IT LAYS OUT. THE AG BASICALLY A PROGRESSIVE FUNDING MODEL OFFER HOW SCHOOLS GET MONEY LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ALL STAR AT THE BOTTOM- PUPILS ENGAGING CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION BETWEEN ZERO AND 19% OF THEIR- ATTENDANCE GENERATES SEVENTY PERCENT. FOR STATE APPORTIONMENT K. AND NOW GOES ALL THE WAY UP. TO BILLS AGAIN I'M GONNA JUMP AHEAD BUT HE WAS ENGAGING CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION FOR AT LEAST 80% OF THEIR TENANTS GENERATE ONE HUNDRED. PERCENT OF ATTENDANCE FOR STATE APPORTIONMENT SO THERE'S A SCHEDULE FOR OFTEN THE STUDENTS IN A CLASSROOM AND THAT ALIGNS WITH- WITH WITH WHETHER OR NOT THEIR- BRICK AND MORTAR WHETHER NOT THE SCHOOL THE STUDENTS EVEN IN THE CLASSROOMS OF STUDENTS NEVER GOES TO SCHOOL- THERE'S- THAT CANNOT THE NEED FOR THE FACILITY AND THAT'S IF YOU LOOK AT THE- ANALYSIS THAT'S- THAT'S HOW THE- THAT'S WHAT GUIDES. THE FUNDING MODEL. AND THERE ARE SOME STUDENTS WHO ARE DOING. OFFICE WORKING WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOL AND THEY DO HAVE AN HYBRID WHERE THEY DO SO TO A BRICK AND MORTAR THAT ACCOMMODATED IN THE SCHEDULE THAT I SOMETIMES YES. ALL RIGHT SO THEN THE NEXT QUESTION THAT I'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT AND I AM. VERY INTERESTED TO UNDERSTAND IS. THE ACTUAL CALL A MULTI YEAR CALL CALENDAR- AND- AGAIN I AM A COMPLETE BELIEVER THAT PARENTS. AND EVEN ADULTS WELL YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL HAVE. MANY MANY NEEDS AND AS. WAS MENTIONED HI ONE OF THIS. COULD MY GROW WORKER COULD BE. A TEAM. COULD BE I JUST THEIR CHOICE TO NOT BE IN A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS ISSUE RELATED TO THE MULTI CALENDAR. FUNDING AND THE ADA THAT FOLLOWS WITH THAT STUDENT- IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR ON EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS SO A STUDENT DEBT CAN STILL ENROLL WHENEVER THEY WANT YEAR ROUND- AND- LEFT THE CHURCH SAID- THEY'RE STILL FLEXIBILITY AND HOW THE SCHEDULES ARE SETUP- HERE ALONGTHE WAY AND HE'S TAKING CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THAT. CLEAR FOR INDIVIDUALS. SCHOOL FOR THE CONTROL THEIR OWN SCHEDULE AND SO I WHAT I SEE AS- MISTER MIKE FLYING TO ELABORATE ON THAT. I THINK. A COUPLE THOUGHTS ON MULTI TRACK NUMBER ONE THE ISSUE THAT'S TRYING TO BE ADDRESSED AS WERE STUDENTS ARE. ARE ALLOWED TO JUMP FROM TRACK TO TRACK TO ULTIMATELY- GENERATE MORE THAN ONE EIGHTY EIGHT PER YEAR. AT THE STATE'S EXPENSE- AS- THE CO AUTHORS OF SPOKEN TO- CALENDAR SET BY THE LOCAL SCHOOL- SCHOOL DISTRICT- OR CHARTER SCHOOL IN THIS CASE- AND IN THIS PROVISION IS APPLICABLE TO BOTH- THEY CAN- THE STATE LAW. SETS A MINIMUM NUMBER DAY'S INSTRUCTION NOT A MAXIMUM. AND SO IF A STUDENT WERE TO ENROLL QUOTE UNQUOTE LATE IN THE YEAR. THE CHARTER SCHOOL CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE THEM WE SERVE KIDS DURING THE SUMMER IN OTHER- ENVIRONMENTS- WHETHER WE CALL THAT SUMMER SCHOOL OR EXTENDED YEAR WHAT HAVE YOU- BUT THERE IS A- A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DAYS IN CURRENT LAW THAT THE STATE. PAYS FOR THE S. MODEL LIMIT LIMITING FACTOR ON- THE NUMBER OF DAYS THOUGH THAT A STUDENT CAN BE SERVED- SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE SOME CONSIDERATIONS OF AN EXAMPLE OF. WE ARE AT WORST PRACTICE WHERE THERE IS THIS- SCENARIO WHERE ADA COULD BE COLLECTED. MORE THAN ONCE A YEAR FOR STUDENT HOW HOW HAS THAT BEEN OCCURRING SO IN A MULTI TRACK YEAR ROUND JUST ASSUME THERE'S FOUR TRACKS EACH OF THEM STARTED DIFFERENT POINTS. OF CURRENT LAW DOES REQUIRE THAT- THEY MUST ALL HAVE STARTED BY A CERTAIN DATE OR ALL OF REACH SO MANY DAYS BY A CERTAIN DATE IN THE YEAR SO YOU WOULDN'T TYPICALLY BE STARTING A TRACK IN JANUARY AS AN EXAMPLE- SO MULTIPLE TRACKS YOU COULD START JULY ONE. IN THE CASE OF A THREE TO GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE- OF THE ENROLLED STUDENTS ON TRACK ONE ON JULY ONE WHERE THEY WERE ATTENDING. A LITTLE LEAGUE. GAMES AND PRACTICES S. EIGHTY EIGHT BASICALLY- AND THEN THE STUDENT MOVED LATER IN THE YEAR TO ANOTHER TRACK. TO MAXIMIZE OR THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR HOME SCHOOL. A DISTRICT AND THEY WERE SERVED FOR THE REGULAR SCHOOL YEAR BY THAT HOME SCHOOL DISTRICT ALTERNATELY THE STATE PAID MORE THAN ONE ABA FOR THAT STUDENT. CAN I ALSO ASK THE DA TO ELABORATE ON ON THE SIX SAMPLES. I'M SORRY CAN WE ALSO AT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO ELABORATE THANK YOU. RIGHT ENGINE FOR MISTER THEM ALMOST FINDS UP THERE CAN YOU JUST ALSO SPEAK TO HELP THE INTRODUCTION CAL PADS WE ADDRESS SOME OF THIS ISSUE SURE THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL ARE THAT AS THE STATE LOOKS TO FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM- CAL PADS TWO POINT OH. A CAB AS THE STATE'S LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM HERE WHERE AFFECT MATT IS THE STATE'S CONTRACTOR AWKWARD RELATIONSHIP SINCE WERE ALO STATE. A COMPONENT OF THE STATE BUT- WE'RE THE STATE'S CONTRACTOR TO THE CD EITHER OPERATES THAT SYSTEM AND SO WE KNOW IT VERY VERY WELL- THE BILL PROVIDES IT AS THEY LOOK TO- FUTURE- CAL PATCHWORK THAT THEY WOULD ALIGN EIGHTY A WITH CAL PADS. SO THE ACTUALLY SEE AT THE STATE LEVEL AT A PER STUDENT SO CAP HAD SAYS REPORT ON AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT BASIS BUT NOT ADA FOR APPORTIONMENT PURPOSES. THAT'S DONE ON AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT BASES OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CHARTER SCHOOL LEVEL BUT DOES NOT FLOAT UP TO THE STATE WHEN IT FLOATS UP TO THE STATE IS IT'S JUST A TOTAL YOU LOSE VISIBILITY. OF THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AND SO TO SEE ONE OF STUDENTS ENROLLED AND NOT YOU CAN SEE THAT IN CAL PADS BUT NOT KNOW THEIR ATTENDANCE ACCEPTED A VERY HIGH LEVEL INCLUDING. FOR REPORTING ON CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. SO IN ESSENCE I WHAT YOU'RE IS THAT BE IF A DISTRICT AND THAT. FOR SAY ABOUT SCORING THAT'S FOR ADA WOULD BE CAUGHT YES HE'S AT THE UP THE PROVISION OF THE BILL WOULD CATCH THAT. THE CAL PASSED FOR YOU WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE VISIBILITY AT THE STATE LEVEL OF THAT ACTIVITY YES SIR. AND I BELIEVE HE ONE OF THE SAN DIEGO DA YES TWO EIGHT. AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THEY ARE HERE. TO REALLY SPEAK TO. THEIR EXPERIENCED AND WHAT THEY CAN SURE IS LIMITED. WITH A THREE AND SOME OTHER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS. THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA GO. TOO FAR INTO SOME OF THE TECH TO ALLMAN CIVILE BECAUSE THAT'S- NOT WHAT THEY CAME UP FOR TODAY. CORRECT SO TO MAKE SURE THEM ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS ASKED THOUGH. THE QUESTION THE BIGGEST EXAMPLES. OF HOW OLD THE DOUBLE DIPPING WITH ADA HAS OCCURRED. OKAY AND SO NOT ADDRESSING THE POLICY OF WHETHER MULTI TRACK IS GOOD OR BAD BUT WHAT WE FOUND IN THE CASE WAS SPECIFICALLY. LIKE MR FIND EXPLAINED YOU WOULD HAVE A STUDENT FOR INSTANCE. YOU KNOW STEVE A. THAT. IS ENROLLED IN A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR THEY'RE ENTITLED TO ONE EIGHTY A IN A TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR SCHOOL OR A CHARTER SCHOOL. IF THEY WANT TO GO FULL TIME FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR FOR INSTANCE TAKE SUMMER SCHOOL. YOUR ONE EIGHTY A WOULD HAVE TO BE STRETCH FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. IF YOU SWITCHED FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT. OR IF YOU SWITCH FROM ONE CHARTER SCHOOL TO ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS NO ABILITY TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW YOUR SWITCH. YOU CAN END UP RECEIVING YOUR ONE EIGHTY A PLUS AN ADDITIONAL PERCENTAGE OF ADA FOR THE SUMMER SCHOOL OR WHATEVER PART OF THE SCHOOL THAT YOU WENT TO. SO WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR CASE. IS THAT IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE MAXIMIZE PROFITS. YOU WOULD SWITCH. FROM ONE SCHOOL OR SHE'S ME ONE TRACK TO ANOTHER THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL. CHARTER SCHOOLS BY ANY STRETCH OR DOING THAT OR THAT ANY MULTI TRACK FOLKS ARE DOING IT. THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND IN THAT CASE. THAT MAKES SENSE. YOUR CASE BEING ABOUT THE THREE. CORRECT SO YEAH. CAN YOU ELABORATE ON HOW MANY OTHER INVESTIGATIONS YOU HAVE ONGOING RIGHT NOW BESIDES A THREE NO. YOU CAN'T LIBRARY ARE THERE ARE OTHER INVESTIGATION I CAN'T ELABORATE. SO I'LL JUST FINISH UP MY QUESTION AS- SO AS PARENTS CHOOSE THEIR EDUCATION FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OR CHARTER ONLINE OR IN PERSON OR- THEY THEY ARE OLDER KIDS JUST AS YOU WOULD WITH ANY TYPE OF APPLICATION BUT THE WHOLE ADA PART IS NOT REALLY IN THEIR PURVIEW THEY'RE NOT THE ONES THAT. ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRACKING ATTENDANCE FOR EVEN LETTING A DISTRICT KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT'S UP TO THE DISTRICT TO FOLLOW THAT. EIGHTY EIGHT IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY SO I'M JUST MAKING A STATEMENT THAT IN NO WAY DO I BELIEVE THAT PARENTS ARE KNOWINGLY. AT TRYING TO DOUBLE DIP IF YOU WANT TO SAY AND ALSO MAKE THE COMMENT THAT YES THERE'S BAD APPLES AND IN- WHETHER IF WE WANT TO SAY A THREE IF WE WANT TO SAY PUBLIC EDUCATION UNDER ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS AND THAT THIS BILL- AS I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT MORE IS TO TRY TO CREATE THE PARITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THAT ALL OF OUR SCHOOL EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AGAIN WHETHER IT'S ONLINE CHARTER WHETHER IT'S IN AND TRADITIONAL IN CLASS HAS PARITY AND EQUITY- SO I GUESS I REALLY DIDN'T ASK YOU A QUESTION I JUST MADE A PERFECT AND MEDICAL STOP THERE THANK YOU THAT I WILL POINT OUT WHEN THEY PASSED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY EARLIER HE DID SAY THAT THERE WERE OTHER CASES- CORRECT NOT THAT HE WAS DOING THE INVESTIGATION BUT HE HE BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS OTHER INSTANCES AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AT WE HAVE- THE AP CARE COOLEY FAT INSPIRE- NAME THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COVERAGE AND THAT IN THE NEWSPAPER SKAVA TRI VALLEY BACCHANALIA. INSULARITY ARE ARE SOME. OF THE ADDITIONAL- A SCHOOL FOR THAT. THAT WERE HIM FOR A- YES IS AB THERE'S MANY MORE THAN THAT ADMIT DURING MY TENURE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE WE PAY ATTENTION TO THESE SITUATIONS WE PAY ATTENTION TO THE ARTICLES AND COMPARE THERE'S BEEN MANY MORE THAN THAT- THAT ARE FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MR MCCARTY. YEAH THANK YOU I JUST I'M JUST BLOWN AWAY BY THIS EXAMPLE IN SAN DIEGO AND GRANTED THE OPPONENTS THIS WILL SAY WELL THAT'S JUST ONE BAD APPLE NOT ALL OF US AND I'LL GET TO IN A SECOND BUT HOW DID THAT HOW DID THEY GET THE INFORMATION BOOTH THIS THIS WHOLE WHERE WHERE THE- WHERE THE- REPRESENTATIVE. AREA SO THEY USED SOME TYPE OF LITTLE LEAGUE REGISTRATION INFORMATION SO WHAT CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH HOW IT ALL TRANSPIRED OF SOME OF IT I CAN SO THE INITIAL CONTACT THAT WE RECEIVED WAS FROM A LITTLE LEAGUE THAT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS GRANT FUNDING THAT WAS GOING TO COME TO THEM A THREE ORGANIZATION IT HIRED INDIVIDUALS TO RECRUIT STUDENTS TO COME IN FOR THE SUMMER TIME SO WHAT THESE RECRUITERS DID AND WE'RE PAID TO DO SO WAS WENT AND SIGNED UP- LITTLE LEAGUE SPORTS PROGRAMS ALL SORTS OF- SUMMER PROGRAMS. AND ENROLL THEM OFENTIMES WITHOUT THE INDIVIDUAL'S KNOWLEDGE INTO A CHARTER SCHOOL THE RECRUITER WOULD SEAT RECEIVE AN AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR DOING SO AND THEN THE LITTLE LEAGUE FOR INSTANCE MIGHT RECEIVE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER STUDENT OR THE RECRUITER MIGHT GET TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT AND THEN THE BAD ACTOR CHARTER SCHOOL WOULD RECEIVE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT SO. OBVIOUSLY HAD WE HAD TWO THOUSAND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS GOING INTO IT A LITTLE LEAGUE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES EDUCATIONAL SERVICES I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD BEEN AS OF SEPT BY BUT INSTEAD IT WAS GOING TO THE PROVIDERS. YEAH THAT JUST BLOWS MY MIND AND THANK YOU FOR ARTICULATING THAT AND- YES JUST LIKE THE OLD EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE GO ON THE PHONE BOOK AND- REGISTERING VOTERS AND EARNED GETTING YOUR DOWNEY THAT'S JUST FLAT OUT. OUT FRONT IDEA BUT BUT REAL QUICK JUST UNIQUE COMIC I WANT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DA'S OFFICE TO SAVE THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SPECIFIC CASE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSALISM LONG BEACH MY TOWN. AND THEY FOUND A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT ON THE EASTERN SAN DIEGO COUNTY I BELIEVE IN A HUNDRED FORTY EIGHTY A AND THEN GREW UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND. RIGHT AND THIS GUY AT THE BLEEDING ONE CAME FROM AUSTRALIA. AND CAME OVER HERE AND SET UP THIS OPERATION INSTALLED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PLUS INSIDE TWO YEARS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO THE- A- BIG OPERATE IN A BIG BIG DEAL AND NO ONE CAUGHT IT. BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT RIGHT A SMALL DISTRICT WITH HUNDRED. FIFTY STUDENTS GIVE OR TAKE. DIDN'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT THE ODDEST DIDN'T CATCH IT THE ACCOUNT AND CATCHING. THE CAL PAD SYSTEM DIDN'T CATCH IT SO THAT'S WHAT WE SEEK TO RECTIFY HERE TODAY. MR MCCARTY. YEAH I THINK THAT LEADS ME TO THE BIGGER POINT. YOU KNOW I I'M FRUSTRATED HERE THE OPPOSITION. SAYING WE DON'T LIKE THESE BAD ACTORS THEY MAKE IT BAD ON US. AND THEN WE'LL TURN THEM INTO BUT THEN WE COME WITH REASONABLE OVERSIGHT- THAT'S GOING TO SET US OUT OF BUSINESS AND JUST LIKE. I WEEK WE HEAR THIS OVER AND OVER AND THEN WE KEEP HEARING EXAMPLES OVER AND OVER ITSELF. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FROM NOT HAVING PROPER OVERSIGHT ITSELF. HI I THINK YOUR ARGUMENT IS A VERY VERY- HOLLOW. AND I DID WANT TO ALLOW THE CHAIR. OR THE CHAIR THE AUTHOR AND GET THREE AUTHORS HERE. TO TO TALK ABOUT ONE AT THAT YEAH CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS. AND I RECEIVED SOME I RECEIVED SOME EMAILS FROM PUBLIC PEOPLE HERE I KNOW LOCALLY A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE AS YOU KNOW THEY- STATE THEY EMAIL YOU AND TELL YOU ABOUT THE BILL AND THEN YOUR YOU MAY SUPPORTER AUTHOR AND YOU I ALWAYS THINK WELL. THAT MY BILL DID THAT I WOULDN'T SUPPORT IT RIGHT. BECAUSE OF THE IN ALL THESE PIECES IN THERE JUST AREN'T FACTUAL- BUT DON'T LET THE TRUTH GET IN THE WAY OF A GOOD STORY THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR TOO OFTEN IN THIS BUSINESS. SO IF YOU- MISTER O'DONNELL CAN TALK ABOUT THAT THE AMENDMENTS. THAT FIRST FOR SMALLER DISTRICTS- AND THE GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE- AND HOW THAT WE THIS WON'T BE A SHUT DOWN FOR SOME FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. WHO ARE TALKING TO US TODAY I'M SORRY COULD YOU CLARIFY YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE YES HE WAS IN THERE IT IS AMENDMENTS THAT THE IS NOT PART OF A SCHOOLS ARE CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED BIRTH A SMALL DISTRICTS- A GRANDFATHERING PIECE AS FAR AS OUR EIGHTY EIGHT CORRECT- YES. YES THEY DID MAKE. YES NINE ACRE WE HAVE THE- THE COMMITTEE OUT. WHAT THAT PIECE IS TO HAVE. I CAN SPEAK TO IT IS IF YOU CAN SHOW ME WHERE ANALYSIS SECOND SPEAKERS. FROM THE AMENDMENTS ARE ON PAID. I JUST THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THAT I'M I KNOW WE DON'T KNOW ALL THESE MINIMUM LIMIT AND ONE OF THEM YEAH AS CHAIR I'M LIMITED ON WHAT I CAN I KNOW WEIGH IN ON SO I CAN SPEAK TO THEM NOW I THINK IT WOULD HELP US OF THE B. IT'S ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN A SMART PICK TWENTY TWO AND ITS AMENDMENT NUMBER SEVEN THE TOP OF THE PAGE YEP ARE YOU COMFORTABLE SELFIE TO OUTLINE. THE DEBT HOW WE BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS WE HEAR ABOUT THIS AND. THAT THE GRANDFATHERING ISSUES. CAN. BUT MAKING THE PAGE TWENTY TWO MM NUMBER. SEVEN TWENTY TWO BUT I AND I CAN SPEAK TO THAT QUITE FRANKLY- IF IT'S ALRIGHT IT BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT DOES IT'S PRETTY CLEAR GET GRANDFATHERS AND NON CLUSTER BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS OUTSIDE THE ADA REQUIREMENTS EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL- SO WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS BILL IS- IF YOU WANT AUTHORIZES CHARTER. YOU'VE GOT TO BE THIS BIG FOR THIS MANY STUDENTS YOU CAN AUTHORIZE THAT BIG FOR THAT MANY STUDENTS TO AUTHORIZE AND WHY THAT WAS PUT IN HERE WAS AAIN WAS THE C. E. SAN DIEGO COUNTY SITUATION AND OTHERS WHERE YOU HAVE A VERY VERY SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT- THAT MAYBE HAVE A HUNDRED HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS- GO AHEAD AUTHORIZING TO A CHARTER SCHOOL TO HAVE TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND AGAIN THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS JONES DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT- THE GOOD ACCOUNTING PRACTICES THE AUDITOR SAID WHERE THEY NEED TO TAKE PLACE SO WHAT WE DID ABOUT IT IN THIS BILL WAS CREATED A THRESHOLD. OF PROGRESSIVE- IT'S AND FORGOT NUMBER OF STUDENTS. A STUDENT A DISTRICT MUST HAVE. TO APPROVE A CERTAIN SIZE CHARTER. SO IF YOU'RE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU COULD PROBABLY. AUTHOR IS A SMALL NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS EVEN IF YOU'RE LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU COULD AUTHORIZE A LARGER NUMBER. OF CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS- BUT AGAIN THAT THAT THAT THAT THRESHOLD THAT PROGRESSIVE NUMBER. IS BUILT IN THERE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DISTRICTS HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT THAT THUS FAR HAS REALLY NOT BEEN PROVIDED OR LEAD TO SITUATIONS LIKE A THREE IN SAN DIEGO. OKAY RANT OVER THERE IN MEANS LORD IF YOU'RE ALREADY IN EXISTENCE. YOU'RE OKAY YOU'RE YOU'RE FINE IF YOU'RE GONNA STATE YOU'RE- YOU'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE NEW REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S A GRANDFATHERING MEANS PERFECT. THANK YOU. ANYMORE QUESTIONS MCCARTY. YEAH STALI. SO SECTION THIRTY EIGHT I HAVE- MULTIPLE CHARTERS IN MY SCHOOL AND IN MY DISTRICT AND THERE IS I'M A HUGE PROPONENT OF PARENTAL CHOICE AND SCHOOL CHOICE BUT TURNER FOR US ARE A NECESSITY THIS ISN'T IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE SCHOOL DOWN THE STREET WE HAVE KIDS THAT RIDE ON THE SCHOOL BUS FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES ONE WAY. SO SOME OF THESE RESTRICTIONS JUST REALLY WON'T WORK FOR THEM AT ALL AND BUT I HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR THE SECTION OF THIRTY EIGHT MY NIECES LIVE IN MODOC COUNTY AND THEY ATTEND A CHARTER SCHOOL IN SHASTA COUNTY SO UNDER AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO THE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS LIKE MY NIECES WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS WHO RESIDE IN ADJACENT COUNTY- LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IN THE BEGINNING A GIVE ME ONE SECOND. LET ME ALSO SAY THAT YOU MISTER C. DO YOU WANNA YEAH SO RESPOND A MASON. SO THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT SPECIFIC TO AB THIRTEEN SIXTY BECAUSE UNDER CURRENT LAW EXISTING CURRENT LAW. NOT CONSUMMATE CHARTER SCHOOLS CANNOT HAVE DISABILITIES AND ADJACENT COUNTIES. ARE AND SO THIS BILL. IS THAT ISSUE THERE IS NOT A RESULT OF THIS BILL BUT AT THE RISK OF RESULTS OF EXISTING- CURRENT LAW OUT THERE. ARE THEY MAY ONLY HAVE FACILITIES IN THE DIFFICULT'S. THEY ARE AUTHORIZED. SO IN GENERAL THAT'S A- THOUGHT IN THE VALLEY I LIVE IN THERE'S THREE COUNTIES. WITHIN ONE. AREA SO COUNTY LINES THE THAT'S VERY BURDENSOME FOR CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN VERY ROLE FRONTIER AREAS BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS OF YOUR SITUATION THE SITUATION YOU CITED THEY'VE AND ROLLED IN THE SCHOOL IS EVER COUNTY. YES BILL DOESN'T PRECLUDE THEM FROM DOING THAT AND ROLLING IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY SO THAT THEY WOULD BE FINE. IT DOES IT DOES WORK OKAY DOES APOLOGIZE I'M AYE BUT IT'S CURRENT LAW I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BILL BUT EXISTING CURRENT LAW ALREADY. THAT I WHILE HOW WOULD THEY BE GOING TO SCHOOL RIGHT OFF ITS CURRENT LAW. COULD BE THAT THERE THAT THE CURRENT LAWS I BEAT HIM BLACK OF OVERSIGHT. OF NOW. THAT THAT. I'M YEAH THAT'S THAT'S COULD I COULD I DIRECTLY ADDRESSES BECAUSE I. I HAVE THE SAME CONCERN DO YOU MIND HAVING. GREAT I. SO CHELSEA CAN CAN USE THIS CHELSEA'S THE COMMITTEE CONSULTING WROTE THE ANALYSIS- AND SHE'S GOING TO SPEAK TO THE MATTER. THE CURRENT LAW SPECIFIES THAT NONHAZARDOUS CHARTER SCHOOLS CANNOT HAVE FACILITIES OR SATELLITE FACILITIES IN ADJACENT COUNTIES UNLESS THEY WERE APPROVED BY THEIR LOCAL DISTRICT OKAY THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO WE PASSED THAT LAW. THIS BILL WITH SPECIFIED THAT THE ATTENDANCE BOUNDARIES FOR NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD BE THE COUNTY IN WHICH THEY ARE. AUTHORIZED BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE FACILITIES. SO IF I COULD FOLLOW UP WITH THAT I DISCOVERED THIS ALSO THIS THIS ISSUE OF THE- OF A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT HAS FACILITIES IN TWO COUNTIES SO ACTUAL ONLINE FACILITIES. AND YET YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT OF THE NOT NORMALLY LEGAL BUT IF THE COUNTY IF THEY IF THEY SOUGHT APPROVAL. IT HAS IT THEN DOES BECOME LEGAL SO THAT'S HOW. THAT'S HOW THE SAID THAT'S HOW THIS EXIST AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND SO- HI I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. I'VE I'VE TALKED TO THE OFFICER ABOUT IT IT IS- LOOKING AT THIS AS THIS MOVES FORWARD IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE MOST CURRENT SCHOOLS IN THAT SITUATION BUT- YEAH MISTER BENNETT DID BRING ME AN ISSUE THAT HE HAS FOUND IN SANTA BARBARA. THAT HE SAID WE WOULD DISCUSS AND SEEK TO FIND A SOLUTION UPON AND THIS MAY BE VERY ISSUE THAT YOU'RE CITING RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE- FIGHT COMPLETELY ALIGNED. BUT I KNEW YOU KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE A TOPIC THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS AND WORK ON ASSOCIATED WITH WITH WITH. FACILITIES AND WHAT WHAT COUNTY THEY'RE LOCATED THE NEXT DOOR COUNTY X. ADDRESS SO THAT IS A TOPIC WE NEED TO DISCUSS MORE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BILL. AND BRING UP ISSUES THAT PEOPLE AREN'T AWARE OF OR MIGHT NOT HAVE CONTEMPLATED BEFORE TODAY AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE SOLVE THAT RIGHT NOW NO BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DISCUSS THIS IS OUR FIRST COMMITTEE FOR THIS BILL- AND WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT. THE AUTHOR IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE LOOKING FOR THE SAME OVERLAP BETWEEN MISTER BENNETT AND- AN ENDLESS STALI S. ASSEMBLY PORCELAIN I WOULD BE A THIRD ON THAT TO LOOK AT AMENDMENT TO THAT COULD WORK. THE SPECIFIC. SCENARIO OUT. SO I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON. THE IS MIKE A CLARIFYING I GUESS THE VISITATION IN PERSON VISITATION WITH YOUR TEACHERS WHAT IS A REQUIREMENT UNDER THE SPELL. LET ME GIVE YOU ONLY GIVE YOU THE SPECIFIC NUMBER BECAUSE I ALREADY. STATED IN MY PRESENTATION. BUT RIGHT NOW NO REQUIREMENTS- IT'S EVERY THIRTY MINUTES EVERY THREE DAYS NO TWO THREE EVERY THREE DAYS CONTACT EVERY THREE DAYS IT'S CONTACT EVERY THREE NINE THAT BE VIRTUAL YEAH OKAY SO I DON'T HAVE INTERNET MINE AND MY DISTRICT SO CAN. THE PHONE. IN THE PHONE CAN IT BE FOR ME THIS IS OUR THIS IS LEGITIMATE THAT WE DON'T HAVE BROADBAND AND IN A GOOD PORTION OF MY DISTRICT SO. IF IT'S A REQUIREMENT TO VIRTUALLY TOUCH BASE EVERY THREE DAYS THAT ISN'T GOING TO WORK FOR MY DISTRICT THINK IT INCLUDE PHONES. AS WELL THE PHONECALL HOW ARE THEY CONNECTING NOW I GUESS I WAS ON BROADWAY WE ARE TAKE THEIR PARENTS WERE QUESTIONED AND GOOD BUT THE QUESTION. SO THAT'S A CONCERN FOR ME OKAY THAT'S NOT EVERY THAT'S NOT IT THAT'S NOT A GUIDELINE OR REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD BE ACT WOULD PHYSICALLY BE WORKABLE FOR SOME OF MY- STUDENTS. SO AND ALSO A LOT OF THEM WILL TRIP THEY TAKE MY SISTER IN PARTICULAR. TAKES HER KIDS PHYSICALLY DRIVES THEM TO THEIR TEACHER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WORKS FOR THEM THAT'S THE MODEL THAT WORKS FOR THEM. BUT IT ISN'T EVERY WEEK AND SO. BUT THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT. ISN'T HAPPENING BECAUSE- SO I THERE'S A THERE'S A QUITE A FEW THINGS IN THIS BILL THAT JUST DON'T WORK FOR ROLE. CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW IT CAN BE MY ONLY MY DISTRICT THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE ROLE. PARTS OF THEIR DISTRICT AS WELL. MR KILEY MISTER BIGELOW WHAT GOES ON AND ON. SO ANYWAY I DEFINITELY THINK THERE'S SOME WORK TO BE DONE HERE AND I WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS MCALLISTER. AND FOR PHONE CALLS DID NOT WORK EITHER BECAUSE THAT'S AWFUL. THAT'S ONE OF THE WAY THE CONTRACT OFFER TO THE PHONE. DEPENDS ON SELF SERVICE OR NOT AND I'M TO AND BEYOND CAN DRIVE OUT THROUGH MY DISTRICT WITH ME SOMETIME AND- CHECK IT OUT BUT THAT'S A LEGITIMATE. THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS. THAT I. OR LAND LINE IS ANOTHER OPTION TO RIGHT WE DON'T KNOW HAVE CELLPHONES I'M GONNA HAVE BEEN OUT THERE AND SO I KNOW THAT- CELL PHONE DOESN'T WORK- IN LOTS OF PLACES- BUT I. THANK YOU HAVE A HOME IN THE MOUNTAINS AND I HAVE A LAND LINE IT HAS VERY LIMITED INTERNET BUT I'M ABLE TO MAKE THIS CALL SAYS FINE- I THOUGHT. NOTHING UP OFF THE FOR TRACTION. I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY. I WE WANT TO GET FLEXIBILITY HAVE. QUALITY INCIDENTS NEEDS ARE BEING MET I WAS ACTUALLY JUST TUTORING. WHATEVER COLLEAGUES- KITS AT YESTERDAY. AND THE FRUSTRATION THEY WERE HAVING BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HAVE ANY INTERACTION WITH THE TEACHERS ANSWER SOME BASIC QUESTIONS. FOR THEM AND SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE GETTING INTERACTION THAT'S QUALITIES CONCERT QUESTIONS THAT ENSURE THAT THEY'RE- PROGRESSING- AND GETTING OUT OF FAIR. EDUCATION I THANK YOU OTHERS ARE MISTER KILEY. THAT WAS PROBABLY GOING. THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THE AUTHORS ACTUALLY I OWN OF COURSE YOU'RE FREE TO CHIME IN IF YOU'D LIKE- I JUST HAVE QUESTIONS FOR A FEW QUESTIONS FOR TO THE WITNESSES- FIRST FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION- AND THEN FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND READ YOUR LETTER OF SUPPORT AND- AND YOUR MEMO WHICH IS A VERY IMPRESSIVE DOCUMENT THIRTY THREE PAGE MEMO. GOING THROUGH. EACH OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL OR AT LEAST MANY OF THEM- AND EXPLAINING. HOW THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL IN PREVENTING THE SCHEME THAT YOUR OFFICE ON COVERED. IN THEM MCMANUS CASE AND- YOU CLEARLY DID EXCEPTIONAL WORK IN THAT CASE AND SO- YOU KNOW I'VE GIVEN- THE OPINION OF YOUR OFFICE A LOT OF WEIGHT AND CONSIDERING THIS LEGISLATION AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I HAVE. A CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT WHAT YOUR POSITION IS I MEAN DESERVE SUMMARIZE THOSE DOCUMENTS IN YOUR- TESTIMONY TODAY YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL. WOULD HELP PREVENT PROTECT. THE PUBLIC AGAINST THE SORT OF FRAUD THAT PLAYED OUT IN THE LEAD TO THE MCMANUS CASES ALL RIGHT. WELL LET ME EXPLAIN THANK YOU FOR GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY AND FOR READING THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS. WE SUBMITTED TO YOU FOLKS DOCUMENTS THAT WERE RELATED TO OUR AREAS OF- WHAT WE SOCCER. AND ARE AREAS WHEN WE READ THROUGH THE BILL THAT WERE RELATED TO. THE CASE THAT WE SOCCER. WERE NOT IN THE POSITION TO PUT FORWARD PUBLIC POLICY HAS TO ALL AREAS- THERE CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BILL. THAT WE WEREN'T INVOLVED WITH- BUT THE AREAS THAT WE WERE INVOLVED WITH WE WANT TO GIVE INFORMATION. AS TO WHAT WE SAW AND HOPEFULLY AREAS THAT YOU AS THE LEGISLATURE ASSEMBLY YOU. CAN YOU KNOW CAN SOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES. I SEE AN- SO YOUR LETTER SAYS YOU'VE SUPPORT THE BILL YOU IN FACT THINGS AS YOU EMPHATICALLY SUPPORT THE BALLOT OR YOUR OFFICE DOES- IF THERE'S OF COURSE YOU KNOW BEEN HUNDREDS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE WEIGHED IN. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IT IS THE MIDDLE LETTERS IN OPPOSITION- SAYING THAT THIS IS GOING THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD- INHIBIT THEIR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN THIS SITE MANY OF THE PROVISIONS THAT YOU ALSO CITE- IN YOUR LETTER AND SO. AND THIS IS GONNA HARM THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE THEIR FAMILIES WELL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO SORT OF DOUBT THAT. AT ALL I AM- I WILL SEVEN I WILL- THIS I TALK TO THE DA. FROM SAN DIEGO COUNTY YESTERDAY- AND WE HAD A LENGTHY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE BILL AND ABOUT WHAT SHE BRINGS TO THE TABLE HERE TODAY IN WHICH. SHE SOUGHT TO DO IS BRING SOME. I GUESS PROSECUTE. PROSECUTORIAL EXPERTISE NOT EDUCATIONAL. POLICY EXPERTISE TO US TODAY. SO I'M NOT GOING TO ASK HIM TO ASK THAT QUESTION RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- AGAIN YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING INTO A LANE THAT SHE- DOESN'T SEE HERSELF AND- SHE'S NOT GOING TO BLEED INTO- CALIFORNIA EDUCATIONAL POLICY. AS A WHOLE. WHAT WHAT SHE BROUGHT TODAY. WAS A GENTLEMAN WHO IS VERY EXPERIENCED IN A CASE. DOWN IN SAN DIEGO AND THE CASE IS. IT IS IMPORTANT TODAY BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO WHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS OUR STATE. AND HOW WE TODAY MIGHT ADDRESS PART OF THAT BUT AGAIN I'M- I DON'T WANT HIM GETTING INTO. EDUCATIONAL POLICY AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO ASK HIM TO DO NOW HE'S- SO NOW I'M NOT I'M ASKING HIM. WHETHER YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS PARTICULAR POLICY TOOL I COULD HAVE THE EFFECT. ONE OF ORDER AND MISTER KILEY IS NOT IN THE COURT ROOM HERE. THAT YOU KNOW DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS AND NOW THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT A HYPOTHETICAL IN IN THE IN THE WITNESSES. HAD HE'S TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE FEELS ABOUT BRING ACCOUNTABILITY THAT YOU'RE ASKING HIM ABOUT THAT WHAT THE OPPOSITION THINGS THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S HERE FOR AND THIS IS. THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE% QUESTIONING SO I THINK YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE IF YOU CAN IT'S NOT A PROGRAM AYE AYE SCOTT LISTEN I'M GONNA I'M GONNA PASS THE GENTLEMAN NOT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION BECAUSE I BELIEVE YOUR QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO EDUCATIONAL POLICY AS A WHOLE. AND THAT'S AS HE HAS CLEARLY STATED NOT HIS EXPERTISE AND NOT WHY HEIS HERE TODAY I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE ANSWER LET THEM WHAT THE LETTER WHEN TO SPEAK FOR HIMSELF USING. TO ME. THAT THE- UNSETTLED. I THINK YOU HAD ANOTHER QUESTION FOR ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL- NO I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF THIS WITNESS. I MEAN THEY'RE WEIGHING IN ON AN EDUCATION BILL I'M NOT ASKING TO A PINE EDUCATION POLICY YEAH BUT YOU'RE ASK MISTER CHAIR HE'S ASKING HIM TO GIVE HIS OPINION. ON WHAT THE OPPOSITION FIX NO I'M NOT YEAH YOU DID YOU SAID WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THE OPPOSITION SAYS THIS IS GONNA SHUT PEOPLE DOWN. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY SAID TO SACRIFICE. ARGUMENT WAS GIVEN ON ITS USE ME EXCUSE. ALONG WITH REYES MORTAR HERE AFFECT OKAY IF YOU HAVE AN- OTHER QUESTION. FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL. THAT IS. WITHIN HIS LANE A FEW HORROR- I'LL ASK HIM TO ANSWER IT BUT I'M GETTING. I THINK YOU'RE BLEEDING INTEGRATOR EDUCATIONAL POLICY AND THAT'SNOT HIS ROLE HERE TODAY OKAY MAYBE OUT OF WHAT YOU SEE IS THE SCOPE OF YOUR TESTIMONY. SO THAT I KNOW WHAT I SHOULD GET MY QUESTION TO. I BELIEVE HE ALREADY STATED WHAT HIS SCOPE WAS HERE TODAY WHAT IS THAT WHEN IT'S JUST YOU KNOW IT IS GIVING. YOU THE OPPORTUNITY. HUSING HEY. HE STATED THE WHEN HE CAME UP HERE. WHAT WHAT WHAT HIS WHAT HIS ROLE WAS HERE TODAY AND I WANT TO RESPECT THAT WELL BECAUSE LOOK HE CAME UP FROM SAN DIEGO. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST LIKE REMINDERS THAT I CAN KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS OR ARE WITHIN BOUNDS. OF KIND OF WHAT YOU HAVE YES GOT IT AND I BELIEVE HE STATED THE SCOPES OF ASKING THE QUESTION IS CAN I PLEASE JUST GET A REMINDER OF WHAT THE SCRIPTURES ESTONIANS. THERE WERE HERE TO INFORM OF WHAT WE SAW IN OUR CASE WHERE WE CAN BECAUSE I'VE ON FORCE AFTER MINE EITHER STILL SOME ONGOING ASPECTS OF THE CASE THAT ARE THE LEGAL CHALLENGES AND THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT THAT OCCURS AT THE STATE LEVEL SO- I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE POLICIES OF THIS BILL AND WHETHER OR NOT ALL THOSE POLICIES WOULD BE GOOD OR BAD BUT JUST THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND THE ISSUES THAT WE SAW. AND THAT YOU AND THE REASON YOU IDENTIFY YOU BELIEVE WOULD BE AFFECTED RELEASE WOULD HELP INTO MAKING SURE THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. CORRECT AND I TAKE IT SINCE THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE A KIND OF OUTSIDE OF. YOUR LANE THAT YOU DIDN'T CONSIDER WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS THAT WAS YOU JUST KIND OF. ANALYZE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT. WITH IT WE POINT OUT WHAT WE SAW IN OUR CASE AND- ORDER THEM MAJOR ASPECTS OF IT WAS THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT AT THE STATE LEVEL OF THE- LACK OF% FOLLOWING OF THE STATE FUNDS. AND THEN AS A BROKE DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL LEVELS. THE FACT THAT THE OVERSIGHT WASN'T THERE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. AND THAT BECAUSE OF THAT UNFORTUNATELY. MONEY THAT SHOULD HAVE GONE TO STUDENT EDUCATION WENT TO THE FOLKS THAT WERE. RUNNING THESE BAD ACTORS SCHOOLS AND TAKING THE MONEY. THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THE CASE SURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR I HAD A QUESTION FOR ANOTHER WITNESS. YEAH THIS IS. A FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AS WELL I WANT TO ASK ABOUT A PORTION OF YOUR LETTER- OF SUPPORT WERE YOU SAID. A PACKAGE OF BILLS PASSED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WE COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVISIONS OF AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN OF THIS BILL WOULD BLATANTLY VIOLATE THE AGREEMENT REACHED TO THE NEGOTIATIONS ON ALL THESE BILLS TO LIMIT FURTHER CHARTER RESTRICTIONS SO. CAN YOU JUST I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO THE SENATE TESTIMONY IS WHAT WHAT WHAT EXACTLY WAS THAT AGREEMENT. WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF IT. WELL L. AS YOU MAY RECALL- IN A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THREE MASSIVE PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT WERE INTENDED TO ADDRESS ESPECIALLY SOME SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OUT OF. OUT OF AREA AUTHORIZING- THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUES ISSUES THAT HAD NOT BEEN RESOLVED FOR TEN YEARS AND WE HAD BEEN MEETING IN THESE ROOMS. I TRIED TO COME TO REASONABLE COMPROMISES- IT. SB ONE TWENTY SIX ADDRESSED ALL THOSE ISSUES WITH GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN OPERATIONS IN. A CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS IMPROVING PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY. AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE AUTHORED BY CHAIRMAN DONALD. INCREASED AUTHORIZED TO DISCRETION AND CHARTERING DECISIONS AND PROVIDING CLEAR. AND SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATIONS INCLUDING A BROAD. ARRAY OF ADDITIONAL MEASURES SPECIFICALLY RELATE RELATED TO CREDENTIALING AND- SECURITY CHECKS AND MANY OF THOSE ISSUES. THEN FIFTY NO SEVEN EIGHTY FIFTEEN OH SEVEN. ALSO A- CO AUTHORED BY CHAIR DONALD AND MISTER MCCARTY- AUTHORED BY MISS SMITH ADDRESSED A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE IT PRECISELY IN. FULL EVIDENCE HERE IN IN YOUR DISCUSSION. THAT RELATED TO OUT OF ARE AUTHORIZING- OF THE LOCATION OF RESOURCE CENTER. RESOURCE CENTER SPELL WHERE DOES NOT CLASSROOM BASED SCHOOLS COULD BE OPERATED. AND A LOT OF AUTHORIZER. TRANSPARENCY END UP IN OVERSIGHT. THE FULL. BRUNT OF THOSE MEASURES JUST APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE REGULATORY. PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTATION YET. SO BUT HOW DOES BILL BY ANY. AND WHAT IS I MEAN. WHEN V. THIS PACKAGE OF BILLS- WAS APPROVED- WE AGREED THAT THERE WOULD BE A TWO YEAR MORATORIUM WHILE ADDITIONAL. MEASURES PRECISELY AROUND NON CLASSROOM BASED OPERATIONS POSITION A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED HERE THAT WE WOULD PICK THIS UP IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER. AT AT THE AT A LATER DATE CERTAINLY THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AND AT AND DEEP STUDY- YOU ERY CHALLENGING IN THIS YEAR WHEN EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL ACROSS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NON CLASSROOM BASED SCHOOL LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF THAT IN OUR- NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN LEADING THE WAY IN PROVIDINGVERY HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION AND MODELING FOR AND PARTNERING WITH DISTRICTS. ON HOW TO DO IT WELL. HOWEVER BY RE LITIGATING THE ISSUES OF TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE ALREADY PUT BEHIND US AND DUMPING THEM ONTO THIS VEHICLE. THAT IS OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE SAID WE WOULD AGREE TO AND REALLY UNDERMINES GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S COMPROMISED. THAT IS OUR VIEW WELL I MEAN I DON'T KNOW A FAIR CRITICISM I MEAN WHO ARE THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT THE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ALL THE THINGS I'VE ALL THE PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT WERE ALL OF US THAT TOGETHER SIGNED OF THAT LEGISLATION WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM INCLUDING ALL OF THE LABOR THE MANAGEMENT GROUPS. MANY OF THE FOLKS IN THIS ROOM. WELL I MEAN I WHAT DIDN'T- SUPPORT THAT L. OUTSIDE THREE OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE THE TIME SO HOW CAN WE- YOU KNOW SAY THAT THIS BILL REALLY VIOLATES ANY AGREEMENT THAT WE WOULD BE. I IS THAT REALLY A FAIR CRITICISM YOU CAN SOMEHOW BINDS THE LEGISLATURE SPEECH OR ACTIONS. WELL IT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT IT WOULD BE A PUTS ALL OF THESE ISSUES. UP OF FOR COLLABORATION AND DEBATE AND CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE WANT TO ACTUALLY TARGET THE ISSUES THAT- THAT THAT WE WOULD. ADDRESS IN A LATER SESSION THAT WE WERE AT THE AT INTENDING TO ADDRESS THOSE IN A SCOPED AND SURGICAL MATTER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WERE STILL LEFT OUTSTANDING. AND YET WE'RE REALLY RELATE TO GETTING NEW IT GOT OLD ISSUES. OKAY I MEAN I. I MEAN MY VIEW AT THE TIME WAS THAT. THIS AGREEMENT OF COURSE WASN'T GONNA BE HONORED IF IT WAS IT WOULD BE THE ONLY TIME IN WORLD HISTORY THAT A APPEASEMENT HAS WORKED SO DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE THE TIME HAS COME TO CALL A SPADE A SPADE AND TO RECOGNIZE. THAT THIS BILL IS PART OF AN EFFORT OF THIS CAPITAL TO AND CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. I CERTAINLY THAT'S THE INTENT OF THIRTEEN SIXTEEN. IS THERE ANY CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THAT UNDER THE GUISE OF PARITY AND EQUITY WE ARE LOSING THE VERY SOUL OF WHAT MAKES GOOD CHARTER SCHOOL SUCCESSFUL DEALING ESPECIALLY WITH THE MOST MARGINALIZED AND MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS WE WERE THE ONES LIKE I SAID WITH WE WERE THE FIRST TO RAISE THE ISSUE NUMBERS PLEASE SUMMER. WE WERE THE FIRST TO ISSUE WHAT WILL ALERTS THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH A THREE IT IS CERTAINLY NOT YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION A LONGER SAID YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THAT I DON'T THAT WAS MY LAST QUESTION I HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU I IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE IN AGREEMENT- AND I THINK THAT THAT FACT JUST NEEDS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED IT'S EITHER IT'S TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY IT'S FRAUD. WHATEVER THE PURPORTED JUSTIFICATION MIGHT BE FOR THIS BILL OR THE NEXT BILL THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THERE'S AN EFFORT TO ENSURE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE FOUGHT AGAINST ON THIS BILL- AND THAT MANY OTHERS LIKE IT THAT WE'RE SURE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE IF WE DON'T TAKE A STAND NOW WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS AND CERTAINLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY'RE READY THERE IS A LINK HERE I THANK YOU THAT WE ARE NOT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. CAN I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR THAT AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE AUTHORED ON GAY ESTABLISH A TO A MORATORIUM ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS IN THE ANALYSIS HERE WHY DID IT DO THAT AS SHE HAS STATED SO WE COULD WORK ON OTHER ISSUES. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY IT'S. THAT SIMPLE MISS GARCIA- GATH. I FIND IT INSULT. THAT TRY TO ENSURE WE HAVE PARITY AND GOOD GOVERNMENT AND WE STOP ABUSE- IS SEEN AS- AN ATTACK ON. HER SCHOOL THESE BILLS APPLY TO BOTH DISTRICT AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. OUT THERE. I WILL SAY THAT THOSE BILLS THAT WERE REFERENCE I. DID NOT COVER ANY OF THE ABUSE THAT WE THOUGHT BY EIGHT THIRTY OUT THERE. INTO THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS AT YOU KNOW THE SITUATION. IS OUT THERE. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT. THE LAST PERSON TALK ABOUT THAT THEY WANT TO IT'S WHEN THEY WANT. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND IT SHOULD BE WHEN THEY WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE THAT WE ADDRESS THEM NOT BECAUSE THE NEED IS NOW IN THE BASE IS GOING ON NOW. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY. YEAH I JUST WANTED TO NOTE I THINK IS TO KILEY. HONESTLY HELP TO DO WITH THE ISSUE THAT- THAT THERE WAS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WHEN THOSE BILLS WERE SIGNED AND GOVERNORS THE GOVERNOR'S STATEMENT AND WE'RE IN THE ROOM IS THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN PUT THESE ISSUES TO REST ME WASN'T THE HOSPITAL CORDON WRITTEN IN SANDSTONE OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AND THAT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER MONEY AND THE- DA OF SAN DIEGO FOUND FRAUD AND THERE WERE SOME ISSUES THAT WEREN'T COVERED AND SO IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY LOOK. AT WEAKNESSES THAT STATE LAW AND RESPONSE. YOU KNOW THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS KILL OF ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS- WE'RE SAYING IT DOES NOT- BRINGS ABOUT FAIR ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S IS WHY WE HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE HAVE A HEARING TODAY. WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD BUT IN OUR VIEW DATA ALLOWS GOOD OPERATORS TO STAY IN EXISTENCE- WE KNOW THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC FATAH FAMILIES TO REALIZE THIS WORKS FOR THEM AND THAT'LL CONTINUE IN. CHARTER SCHOOLS OR YOU KNOW TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS- BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT ENDING CHARTER SCHOOLS AS WE KNOW IT AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS AND- I WITH THAT TYPE YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD CALL THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT YOU WANTED CA. THANK THANK YOU MUCH- AND I APPRECIATE THE INTEREST IN. TRYING TO CALL VOTE- BUT I DO HAVE. SIMPSON COMMENTED I GOT QUITE PROJECT YOUR- FORBEARANCE WHILE I GET THROUGH THIS- THIS IS A AND IMPORTANCIA SIGNIFICANT ISSUE I'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS- WITH THE PEOPLE WHILE I'M TRYING TO DO MY RESEARCH IN PREPARATION FOR TODAY'S HEARING- AND FIRST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE I APPRECIATE TO CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATIVES THAT I MET WITH- WHO GAVE ME SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THE BILL- THAT THEY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT. AND THEY DID THAT FAR ENOUGH IN ADVANCE- THAT I HAD TIME TO EXAMINE THOSE ISSUES. I ALSO APPREIATE MY MEETING- WITH OVER A HUNDRED CHARTER SCHOOL PARENTS- ON ASSUME WHO- I THINK DID A OF. A STRONG JOB OF REINFORCING FOR ME HOW IMPORTANT THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IS TO THEM. AND HOW MUCH THEY VALUE THEIR CURRENT CHARTER SCHOOL EXPERIENCE. ADDITIONALLY I APPRECIATE THE STAFF OF PARTICULAR CHELSEA'S. OF STEADY AND NEARLY ROUND THE CLOCK EFFORT- TO BE AVAILABLE- AND TO PATIENTLY RESPOND TO MY QUESTIONS- ABOUT CLARIFICATION SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT. FINALLY I APPRECIATE TODAY I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS BUT IT WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SANTA BARBARA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S THE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT- SPEAKING- IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL- SANTA BARBARA BEING- THE- MAJOR SCHOOL DISTRICT- YEAH. IN MY DISTRICT. BUT CLEARLY- KATE FORD'S- TESTIMONY- IDENTIFIES THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SERIOUS- THAT THAT THE SERIES OF COMPROMISES OVER THE YEARS. HAS LED TO. MUCH LESS ANIMOSITY AND A STRONGER BOND BETWEEN CHARTER SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS- PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS HAVE. NOT TALKED TO ME ABOUT CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE- ABOUT THIS BILL. AND THAT IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AS BENEFICIAL FOR EVERYBODY AND. HELPFUL TO MAINTAIN AND- SO I PER HER. AND HELPING TO. MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THAT'S OUT THERE AND WHY THEY- HAVE SOME ISSUES SO AS I EVALUATE THIS BILL MY GOAL I JUST HAVE ONE GOAL AND THAT'S JUST GOOD GOVERNMENT JUST TRY TO CONVINCE ME THAT IT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT OUT OF A SUPPORT THE BILL- AND SOME PEOPLE AS- WE'VE HEARD HER TO CHECK YOUR BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL BRING AN END TO NEARLY ALL ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS- AND- THAT THAT IS I BELIEVE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN BEING EXPRESSED BY THE PARENTS THAT ARE COMMUNICATING TO ME HEY THIS IS GOING TO BRING THIS TO AN END- THAT THE PARENT EVEN. IS SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE- THE ISSUES THAT MOST GENERATE THIS CONCERN ABOUT CLOSURE ARE THESE AS FAR AS I SEE IT. THE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE FOR ONLINE LEARNING THE INCREASE OF THE FEE FROM 1% TO THREE PERCENT. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FUNDING FORMULA MOVING IT TO A FORMULA THAT'S BASED ON HOW MUCH ONLINE I MEAN HOW MUCH IN PERSON INSTRUCTION YOU HAVE- AND- THEN THERE. AND THEN THEY ALSO THE RESTRICTION OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS WHICH WAS AT BEING BEING RESTRICTED TO JUST ONE COUNTY- THERE ARE ALSO SOME ISSUES- REGARDING PROCESS FOLLOWED IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE BILL. AND I THINK THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD HERE- BUT LET ME IDENTIFIED THAT THE PROCESS QUESTIONS AS THE WEAKEST ARGUMENT THAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION- IN TERMS OF DOING THAT. I CERTAINLY COMING HERE DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M BOUND BY SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR SAID TWO YEARS AGO SAYING I HOPE THERE'S- PEACE FOR AWHILE- IN THE IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD- MOST OF THE CHANGES ADVANCED BY THIS BILL. I BELIEVE ARE INTENDED AS WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE OF MOVEMENT TO A HEALTHY COMBINATION. OF ONLINE. AND IN PERSON LEARNING. THAT I WANT TO ANSWER THAT EVERY THAT I'VE- IN THIS BILL IS TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE OR REGULATE RIGHT SOME HEALTHY COMBINATION OF ONLINE AND IN PERSON LEARNING- AND THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT EXCEPTIONS TO THIS PRINCIPLE FOR. FOR SUCH A- BUT THE UP TO THIS PRINCIPLE OF A COMBINATION OF ONLINE AND IN PERSON BUT CERTAINLY THE EVIDENCE IS STRONG. THAT THAT IS SUPERIOR TO JUST SIMPLY ONLINE INSTRUCTION ONLY AS- AS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. SO FOR ME THE QUESTION IN FRONT OF US RELEASED. FOR SCHOOLS TO THE DESIRE TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. IS IT APPROPRIATE TO USE A COMBINATION OF INCENTIVES AND REGULATIONS TO TRY TO PUSH. THOSE SCHOOLS TO HAVE A HEALTHY COMBINATION OF ONLINE AND IN PERSON. OR TO LEAVE THE STATUS QUO WHERE THEY COULD DO VERY LITTLE IN PERSON- IF ANY. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I THINK IS TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. DO THAT DO THEY APPROPRIATELY PUSH FOR ONLINE AND IN PERSON WITHOUT HAVING NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE GREATER THAN THE BENEFITS LIKE THAT THAT COULD COME FROM THAT. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUES OF REQUIREMENT FOR PHYSICAL LOCATION THE REGION CREATING THE FEE FROM ONE TO THREE PERCENT. AND THE MODIFYING OF THE FUNDING FORMULA WILL FOR MOST SCHOOLS BECAUSE SOME SOME REAL ADJUSTMENTS THAT THERE WILL JUST WOULD HAVE TO BE RIGHT. BUT I BELIEVE FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT THOSE ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE MADE BY THE SCHOOLS IF THERE ARE SCHOOLS THAT ARE MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. AND ALSO FOLLOW THE SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE THAT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS SHOULD YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN BATTLING OF DEBTS IN BETTER THAN THE LAW REGARDING CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLS. FOR EXAMPLE THE FEE INCREASED FROM ONLY THAT MONEY CAN ONLY BE USED FOR MORE OVERSIGHT. AND IF IT'S NOT USED FOR OVERSIGHT FEE CAN BE CHARGED CORRECT THAT THE FEE WILL BE LESS SO IT'S ONLY IF IT IF YOU NEED IT FOR THE OVERSIGHT. AND CERTAINLY TODAY I THINK A GOOD CASE HAS BEEN MADE OF THAT MORE OVERSIGHT IS NEEDED THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS IF THIS IS COMPLICATED. TO DO THIS KIND OF OVERSIGHT IT'S COMPLICATED IN NORMAL SCHOOLS IF YOU GO TO ONLINE SCHOOLS WITH THE LACK OF PHYSICAL PRESENCE AND THE ABILITY TO TAKE LITTLE LEAGUE YOU KNOW AND DO REGISTRATION ONLINE. SO WE NEED MORE ROBUST ON OVERSIGHT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING WE'RE GOING TO ONLINE ONLINE SCHOOLS. SO I THINK ALMOST EVERYBODY AGREES WE NEED WE DON'T NEED. MORE OVERSIGHT SO A FEE IAN CREASED HEALTH FOR THAT- OVERSIGHT DOES NOT. ME AS INAPPROPRIATE PARTICULAR IF IT'S ONLY ALLOWED TO BE USED FOR THE OVERSIGHT. THE REQUIREMENT OF A OF A PHYSICAL LOCATION- IS- IS A CHALLENGE FOR SOME OF THESE ONLINE SCHOOLS BUT- I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. THE CHARTER ONLINE SCHOOLS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FLEXIBILITYTHAN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS WHEN IT COMES TO THE ONLINE- COMMITTEE PHYSICAL THEY WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP. SO TODAY I STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE COUNTY REACHED RESTRICTIONS I APPRECIATE THAT THE- CHAIR. IS WILLING TO- WORK WITH AND EXPLORE THOSE- AS SHE'S EXPRESSED AND THEN FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AS A RESULT OF COVERT. ONLINE INSTRUCTION HAS ARRIVED FOR MAINSTREAM AMERICA. LIKE IT OR NOT WE GOT EXPOSED TO IT IT IS OUT THERE- AND WE IT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL HAVE NOT REALLY HAD IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS EVOLVING FIELD OF EDUCATION. SO THE QUESTION IS AND I BELIEVE THAT THE OVERALL PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL PROVIDE A COMMONSENSE EFFORT TO TRY TO PROVIDE REGULATIONS NEEDED TO SUPPORT. THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN. ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS GET TARNISHED BY THE A. THREE SCHEDULE ALL OF. SO I WOULD I WOULD HOPETHAT PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT THIS IS SAYING IN THE SPIRIT OF THE COMPROMISE OF US OUT THERE IF WE GET THE APPROPRIATE REGULATIONS AND WE DO IT AN APPROPRIATE WAY. OUT WE ACTUALLY CAN INCREASE THE CREDIBILITY OF- THOSE GOOD FAITH THOSE PEOPLE ARE MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO PROVIDE QUALITY EDUCATION AND FOLLOW THE SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE IT'S SAFEGUARDS. FINAL THING THAT I WOULD THE POINT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT SAID YES ULTIMATELY. IF YOU WANT TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. FOR A FOR PROFIT VENTURE. THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON YOU. AT IS ARE REPEAT IF YOU WANT TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR A FOR PROFIT VENTURE WE DON'T MAKE SCHOOLS USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. TAXPAYERS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA PAY THEIR TAXES FOR THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL. SO BUT WHEN THEY DO THAT THEY EXPECT A LOT OF OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S A AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE A FOR PROFIT COMPANIES COME AGAIN. THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS IT IS ON THEM AND RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE THAT THE- LEGISLATIVE AND EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND IN IN SACRAMENTO IS SAYING. WELL WE BELIEVE IN A COMBINATION OF ONLINE AND IN PERSON. BUT WE'RE NOT SO CONVINCED THAT WERE JUST READY TO JUST SAY IT'S OKAY TO GO COMPLETE ONLINE. WITHOUT ANY APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT SO IF YOU DON'T WANT THE RESTRICTIONS IF YOU WANT MORE FLEXIBILITY.

THAT'S NOT FACTUAL THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. WILL IT GIVE THEM DIFFERENT RULES TO FOLLOW ACCOUNTABILITY- GOOD AUDITING PRACTICES PRACTICES GOOD GOVERNMENT PRACTICES YES BUT THAT DOES NOT CLOSE. ANY ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL THIS IS ALL PART OF A- AN AGREEMENT MADE TWO YEARS AGO. TO PUT THE SEVERED OFF- FOR TWO YEARS THUS THE MORATORIUM WAS PLACED ON NEW ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL SO NOW IS THE TIME THAT THAT CONVERSATION. THAT IS WHAT WAS CONTEMPLATED TWO YEARS AGO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING THIS HEARING TODAY MISS GARCIA- THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK MISTER BENNETT FOR HIS COMMENTS I THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB OF SUMMARIZING. A LOT OF DISCUSSION WE HAVE A LOT OF PASSIONATE INDIVIDUALS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT GOOD QUALITY. EDUCATION TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE IMPORTANT SO I HOPE MOVING FORWARD WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT TAX DOLLARS ARE. PROTECTED WHILE STILL ENSURING THAT PARENTS INSURING THAT PARENTS HAVE CHOICE INSURING THAT OUR- SPECIAL AT THE DEATH OF THE QUALITY THAT THEY NEED AND ALL OVER STUDNTS INCLUDING OUR MOST. MARGINALIZED STUDENTS I HAVE A QUALITY EDUCATION TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL GAP I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTED ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS TO COME. OUT WITH A PRODUCTIVE AMENDMENTS OF THE EXISTENCE OF HOW WE. CAN REACH OUR COMMON GOALS THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU- WITH THAT WILL GO TO THE SECRETARY I DON'T HAVE THE MOTION BEFORE ME SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. IT MEMBERS- FREESHEET THAT LET'S LET US MOVE ON ADAMIS CORK SOURCE AB EIGHT SIX FIVE AB EIGHT SIX FIVE THAT'S FILE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE. RAPPERS AND. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY ASSEMBLYWOMAN QUIRK SILVA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF VERY COLD IN THIS ROOM STUFF AND- AT ANY HOW I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT SIX FIVE WHICH REQUIRES VARIOUS CHANGES TO THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT GENERAL. SERVICES ACT RELATED TO ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO AND VIABILITY OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AS WE KNOW THIS YEAR PARTICULARLY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN SOME OF OUR MOST VALUED FRONT LINE WORKERS IN ORDER TO GET SOME OF OUR PARENTS BACK TO WORK SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WILL ASSIST IN ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS WITHIN OUR STATE CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION SYSTEM BY ALLOWING FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE FULL AMOUNT TO THE CERTIFIED HOURS. NOTED ON A SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE CERTIFICATE AND NOT ON ATTENDANCE AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW THAT OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS NEED TO COUNT ON MANY TIMES THEY ARE BUYING SUPPLIES THEY ARE BUYING MEALS THEY ARE BUYING UP CURRICULUM MATERIALS FOR THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE PLANNED ON. ALLOWING CHILD CARE CONTRACTORS FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND SUBSIDIZE FAMILIES THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MEANS IN ORDER TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF HE FAMILIES. THIS IS PROBABLY SURPRISING TO US MANY OF US WHO DO ONLINE BANKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE ELECTRONICALLY THAT- THIS GROUP HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF THAT. REQUIRE DIRECT DEPOSIT FROM THE STATE TO THE PROVIDERS. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE URGENT NEED TO PROTECT THANK YOU IMPROVE AND ENSURE THE VIABILITY OF CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS PRIMARILY WOMEN OF COLOR SHOW UP EVERY DAY TO CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN. RISKING EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS WILL NEEDING TO FIND OTHER AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR EVEN THEIR OWN CHILDREN HELLO HOWEVER NEARLY QUALIFY FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE BECAUSE MOST OF THEM MAKE. NEAR POVERTY WAGES IT'S UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE DON'T PAY THE PEOPLE TO WHOM WE ENTRUST. OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAFETY AND EDUCATION A LIVING WAGE WELL AT THE SAME TIME HAVE POLICIES THAT HINDER THEIR VIABILITY THE SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE SYSTEM FURTHER HARMS THE FISCAL HEALTH OF THE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. BY ONLY ALLOWING FOR REIMBURSEMENT WHEN I FAMILY ACTUALLY SHOWS UP. AND THIS IS DEVASTATING WHEN YOU LOOK AT A MONTHLY PAYCHECK SO AS WE HAVE BEEN HERE VERY LONG TIME I WILL I WILL. ASK MY- PEOPLE HERE THAT ARE GOING PROVIDE TESTIMONY TO WEIGH IN CRISTINA FOUR FROMMER WHO IS THAT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE CHILDREN'S COUNCIL OF SAN FRANCISCO. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS- GINA AND FORTUNATELY IT'S UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY MY NAME IS MIKE I'M A CHARLES LINE FOR PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR I WILL BE FILLING IN FOR HER TODAY- GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- AGAIN MY NAME IS I IF I WORK AT CHILDREN COUNTLESS DAMPENED BISCO. AND INSEPARABLE GO BY ADVOCATING FOR QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION EMPOWERING FAMILIES. WITH INFORMATION AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND BUILDING THE CAPABILITIES EDUCATORS WE ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN SAN FRANCISCO AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WHY WITH THE COURT EIGHTY EIGHT SIX FIVE THE MAIN FOCUS OF AB EIGHT SIX FIVE THE FOUNDER FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AT A STABLE AMOUNT FOR KEEPING THE POTTERS FIELD FALL FOR ONE OF CALIFORNIA SPENT THE NIGHT FAMILIES. PRIOR TO CO THAT UNITY AGENCIES ARE YET UNIFIED THE SHORT COMING AT THE CORE REASON MY FAMILY WITH VARIABLE ARE UNSTABLE WORK HOURS COULD NOT FIND CHILD CARE. WHEN COATED HEAD ALBEIT CENTRAL WORKERS SUCH AS THOSE IN HEALTHCARE DEEPER MARKET FIREFIGHTERS AND MORE WE'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND A PROVIDER. GOVERNOR NATHAN ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRING THAT CAN WITHOUT CARE PROVIDERS BE REIMBURSED FOR THE CHILD CARE SPOT AND NOT ON THE ATTENDANCE OF THE FAMILY. WITH THE SAME POLICY THAT EXISTS IN THE PRIVATE MARKET BUT ALLOW PROVIDERS MAINTAIN. A SOMEWHAT STABLE BUDGET. I AREAS THAT WERE BROKEN BEFORE HE CAME BACK. DURING THAT. ONE SUCH. IS A PROCESS IN WHICH- A BE WORKING THERE FUNDING REMEMBER HER. AND DISTRICT PROVIDERS THAN THE MULTI DOLLAR ALLOCATION ARE RECEIVED BY AGENCIES VIA MAIL MAIL THIS IS EXTREMELY OUTDATED. AB EIGHT SIX FIVE ADDRESS KEEP WITH THEM UPDATE IN ADDITION TO BASING REIMBURSEMENT OFF OF THE ROLE THAT. IT TAKES THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE NEARLY A MONTH THE PRODUCT THAT THE ALLOCATION AND THEN PRODUCE HARD COPY CAT. THAT ARE THEN PUT INTO FEMALE MALE FOR EXAMPLE THE STATEMENT ENACTED ON FEBRUARY TWENTY THIRD OF THIS YEAR ARE STILL BEING PROCESS PROCESS IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. AND NOT EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVING. AND DISTRIBUTED. OUT TO THE PROVIDERS UNTIL MAY AT THE EARLIEST. PROVIDERS ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY OPEN AND CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE COSTS AND THEN BE REIMBURSED. THIS IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO PROVIDERS CLOSING PERMANENTLY ALLOWING FOR THE ELECTRONIC FUND PROCESS OR DIRECT DEPOSIT OF OUR ALLOCATION WILL HELP US GET MONIES OUT QUICKER TO PROVIDERS. FURTHERMORE EIGHTY EIGHT SIX FIVE ELIMINATE THE LIMITATIONS SURROUNDING CLOSURE DAYS WHICH WILL INCREASE EFFICIENCIES AROUND IN PROVIDER PAYMENTS. EIGHTY EIGHT SIX FIVE WILL ALSO ALLOW CONTRACTORS LIKE EIGHT PIECE TO START SMALLER THEY'RE FUND WHICH WILL HELP STABILIZE THE FIELD PLEASE NUMBER IS FIVE A LOT THE BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY THIRD FAMILY THANK YOU THANK YOU.
