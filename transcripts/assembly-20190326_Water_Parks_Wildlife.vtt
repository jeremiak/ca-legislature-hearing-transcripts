ESTABLISH A OF OUR WATER RIGHTS

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:52.075
SIMPLY BY TAKING WATER -- THAT

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:53.744
SHOULD BE IN THE SYSTEM FOR THE

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.546

PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE I

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:22.866

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.783

UNDER THIS BILL UNDER THE

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:41.418
CURRENT FORM THE BILL WOULD NOT

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:42.286
BE FORFEITED.

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:43.687
AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:45.255
IN THE UNDERSTAND THAT WE WANT

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:46.657
TO PUT WATER IN THE GROUND FIRST

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:49.793

WATER BOARD AND AT THE PART AND

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:00.137
WATER RESOURCES AND SO I THINK

00:49:00.203 --> 00:49:01.104
THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:03.173

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.043

POINTING TO THE TENACITY OF THE

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.626
EFFORT BEHIND THIS BILL -- IT IS

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:24.294
NOT EASY YOU KNOW WATER WATER IS

00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:25.962
NEVER EASY BUT WE KNOW THAT IF

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:27.998
WE KEEP ON DRAINING AQUIFER'S

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.132
AND KEEP ON TAKING IT OUT

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:30.634
WITHOUT HAVING A PLAN TO

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:32.035
RECHARGE THEM -- THAT'S NOT

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:34.905
HEALTHY AND WE WE CERTAINLY

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:35.939
INVITE AND THAT'S THE GET THE

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:36.940
POINT OF THE BILL TO BRING

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:38.642
PEOPLE BACK TO THE TABLE TO

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:39.142
SOMETHING.

00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:40.544
AT I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES IT

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.479
NEEDS TO BE DONE IT IS VERY HARD

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:43.647

AND THINK WE'RE GOING TO

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:58.695
MAINTAIN A HEALTHY SYSTEM WHICH

00:49:58.762 --> 00:50:01.365

REAL DIALOGUE ON THE POLICY THEN

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:40.630

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.267
A REALLY.

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:46.036
KIND OF DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M A

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:47.037
LAND ON THIS BILL I I HAVEN'T OF

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:48.805
STAIN ON IT BECAUSE IT'S THERE'S

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:49.906
JUST SO MANY UNANSWERED.

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:51.975
QUESTIONS AND I KNOW THAT THIS

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:52.576
HAS BEEN TRIED MANY TIMES SO I

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:55.579
GUESS -- WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON --

00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:58.081
MAYBE.

00:51:58.148 --> 00:51:59.649
DIVIDE UP THE STATE AND MAYBE

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:00.951
SOME REGIONS AND MAYBE SEE IN

00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:01.985
SOME BECAUSE IT YOU MOST YOUR

00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:02.886
OPPOSITION IS COMING FROM

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:04.654
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:07.123
AND AND THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.258
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT I I

00:52:08.325 --> 00:52:11.194
AGREE THAT WE NEED -- TO THEY

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:12.095
WERE AREAS WE CAN RECHARGE WE

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:13.964
NEED TO RECHARGE AS BASES IN THE

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.733
VALLEY -- YOU KNOW PORTABILITY

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.134
IN THE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN.

00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:21.171
WHICH IS YOUR AREA ISN'T IT.

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:22.339
RIGHT PACKED YOUR ARE YOU MORE

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.040
OF YOUR DISTRICT ARE DIFFERENT

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:25.242
RESIDENTS SO.

00:52:25.308 --> 00:52:25.876
I'M I'M JUST KIND OF WONDER IS

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:26.877
THERE IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:28.278
MAYBE TO LOOK AT THE STATE AND

00:52:28.345 --> 00:52:31.381
REGIONS OF HANDLING THE RECHARGE

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:33.617
IN THE THOSE THINGS.

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:35.919
IN DIFFERENT WAY.

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:39.723
FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS THE STATE.

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:41.224
I'LL TAKE A STAB AT ANSWERING

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.460
THAT MISTER DALI MERION WARMER

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:44.461
DOWN WITH RC RC.

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:45.795
WE THINK THAT THERE IS SOME

00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:47.998
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THOSE

00:52:48.064 --> 00:52:50.767
CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS.

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:52.369
FIRST AND FOREMOST IN THEIR

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:54.337
REPORT RISK REPORTING

00:52:54.404 --> 00:52:57.173
RESPONSIBILITIES -- ARE IMMINENT --

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.009
AT THE END OF JANUARY OF NEXT

00:52:59.075 --> 00:52:59.709
YEAR.

00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:01.144
SO WE THINK THAT WILL ALSO

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:02.879
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:04.247
THAT WE HAVE.

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:05.615
WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:07.684
VEHICLE AT LEAST TO GIVE US AN

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:09.986
OPPORTUNITY START SCOPING OUT.

00:53:10.053 --> 00:53:11.755
ON GIVEN THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.189
SUCCESSFUL YET TO CONTINUE TO

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:14.824
TRY TO START SCOPING OUT WHAT

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:16.126
MIGHT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS

00:53:16.192 --> 00:53:19.496
OF LOCALLY DRIVEN SIGMA.

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:21.464
PROGRAMS TO HELP US.

00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:24.034
MAINTAIN THE AQUIFER'S INTO THE

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.269
FUTURE RIGHT NOW PARTICULARLY IN

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:28.271
THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:30.140
WE HAVE SOME REAL CHALLENGES AND

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:34.044
WE JUST BE THIS IS ANOTHER TOOL

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.278
IN THE TOOLBOX.

00:53:35.345 --> 00:53:37.080
SO I GUESS THE ANSWER IS IN SOME

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:37.948
WAYS YES I THINK ONE ONE PEOPLE

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:39.316
CRAFT THEIR PLANS THEN IF THEY

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:40.317
HAD THIS IS A TOOL AND MET

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.685
CERTAIN CRITERIA.

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:43.186
THEN I THINK WOULD BE ABLE TO BE

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:44.387
IMPLEMENTED SO I THINK THOSE ARE

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:45.655
ALL CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE VERY

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:50.226
OPEN TO HAVING. ONE OF THE

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:51.161
THINGS THAT WE'RE FACED WITH IS

00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.862
THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING TO

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:53.797
ACTUALLY EVEN IMPLEMENT THE

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:55.465
SIGNAL PLAN AND MOST OF MOST OF

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:58.268
THE GROUND WATER USERS MY

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:00.270
DISTRICT ARE AG AND THEN SMALL

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:01.237
WATER DISTRICTS.

00:54:01.304 --> 00:54:03.139
THAT TERM ARE STRAPPED FOR

00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:04.140
FUNDING TO START OUT WITH SO

00:54:04.207 --> 00:54:07.377
THAT THE SIGNAL REGULATION IS.

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:08.712
IMPAIR DAM FOR MAIL TO YOU YOU

00:54:08.778 --> 00:54:10.380
HAVE PROP TWO EIGHTEEN WHERE YOU

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:12.882
CAN'T REYES CAN'T RAISE REVENUES

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:13.917
AND QUITE FRANKLY SOME OF THOSE

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:15.285
CAN.

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:15.952
WATER SYSTEMS CAN'T CAN'T AFFORD

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:16.886
IT.

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:18.188
AND SO WE'RE STOCK IT WERE IN A

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:20.056
BOX WE WE HAVE.

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:22.092
A GREAT AND IN THAT SUPPOSEDLY

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:23.326
AN IMPACT IMPAIR GROUNDWATER

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:24.427
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROVE THE

00:54:24.494 --> 00:54:26.029
MONITORING WHICH IS AN HASN'T

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.631
BEEN DONE FOR EVER.

00:54:27.697 --> 00:54:29.633
AND SO IT WE'RE KIND OF IN A BOX

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:30.867
AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.402
TO GET US OUT OF THAT BOX AND

00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:33.136
MOVE FORWARD I OBVIOUSLY WE

00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:35.605
DON'T WANT.

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:36.539

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:38.375
IN.

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:39.309
AND WE WANT TO RECHARGE WHERE WE

00:54:39.376 --> 00:54:40.176
CAN IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS THREE

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:40.744
CHARGES ARE DIFFERENT THAN

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:43.713
OTHERS AND SO ANYWAY I'M CUTS

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.983

THE GOVERNOR IN HIS VETO MESSAGE

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.312
ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF THE FACT

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:50.879
THAT.

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:52.381
THERE'S ALREADY TWO HUNDRED

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:53.315
SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

ADVANTAGE OF IS THERE.

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:04.593
WHAT DO YOU SEE IS THE COST FOR

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:05.961

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:17.272
FISCAL IMPACT AND APPROPRIATIONS

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:19.441
THE THE POLICY OF THIS IS TO

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:21.644
ALIGN VOTER INTENT WITH PROP

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:22.244

IT'S RULE URBAN AREAS LET'S

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.119
FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:31.887
ACTUALLY GET KIDS TO THE PLACES

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.055
THAT THEY NEED TO BE IN A LINE

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.891
ON WHAT THE VOTERS WANT. FOR

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:40.195
THERE WAS ANOTHER MEASURE THAT

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:42.064
CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE PRIOR.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.867
AND THIS THE SAME.

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:45.968
ONE WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:48.437
IS AN A GROWING.

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:49.805
QUESTION FOR US TO FACE AS A

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:51.607

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:56.979
NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS.

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.214
IN THE RED -- FOR DEFERRED

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.683
MAINTENANCE.

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:02.317
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GIVE THEM A

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.787
MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE WHEN MANY

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:05.554
OF THE AREAS ARE GONNA HAVE TO

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.423
BE CLOSED BECAUSE OF SAFETY

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:10.192
CONCERNS AND A LACK OF FUNDING?

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:12.261
WE SEEM TO HAVE AGAINST THE CART

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:12.895
BEFORE THE HORSE WE NEED TO MAKE

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:15.064
SURE THAT WE HAVE A SAFE PLACE

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:18.367
FOR THESE -- YOUTH AND

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:19.535
INDIVIDUALS TO GO.

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:20.836
TO SO IT IT'S KIND OF A DOUBLE

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:22.638
EDGED SWORD HERE WE WANT TO HAVE

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.606

BUT WE'VE WE'VE GOT.

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:29.978
PROBLEMS OR ISSUES HERE TO

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:32.414
ADDRESS SO HOW DO YOU SEE AS

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.083
FACING THAT ISSUE WITH THE

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.452
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND THEIR

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.220
IMPACT THAT THIS MAY STIMULATE.

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:39.388
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THE

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:40.489
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PART I

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:42.591
THINK THAT OUR PARKS HAVE BEEN

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.560
IGNORED FOR QUITE SOME TIME --

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.795
INCLUDING OUR STATE BEACHES I'VE

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:47.796
BEEN TO SOME STATE BEACH OF THAT

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:50.299
CLEARLY NEED -- SOME HELP AND I

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:52.000
AND I WORRY ABOUT.

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:53.502
YOU KNOW -- I WENT TO ONE STATE

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:56.338
BEACH THE WHERE THE STEPS GOING

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:58.273
DOWN WERE CRACKED MADE A CEMENT

01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.708
IN THE RAILING WHICH WAS -- MADE

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.844
OF IRON CLEARLY NEEDED TO BE

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:04.446
REPLACED SO I WORRY ABOUT THAT

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.781
TOO WHAT I'M ALSO CONCERNED

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:07.850
ABOUT IS THAT THE STATE BEACHES

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.251
ARE HAVE BECOME A LITTLE ELITE.

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:10.686

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.087
ACCESS TO THEM.

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:13.689
SO I BELIEVE THAT IF WE CREATE A

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.290
PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS.

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:16.892

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.265
TO CREATE NEW PROGRAMS THAT

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:19.001
BECAUSE A DRAIN.

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.268
AND MISS GRILL IS.

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.670
TRYING TO DO A AN ADMIRABLE

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:23.171
THING HERE AND AND THAT'S GET

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:24.373
THE YOU GET THE PEOPLE INTO THE

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:24.806
PARK.

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:27.776
BUT IT CASA COMES AT A COST

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:28.410
BECAUSE NOW THAT COST WILL BE

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.145
ACTS AND IT'LL BE LESS MONEY

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:31.513
COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.848
APPROPRIATIONS.

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:34.683
THAT WILL REDUCE THE ABILITY FOR

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.418
US TO CONTINUE TO FIND OR GET

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:39.321
MORE MONEY. TO TO THE PARKS TO

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:40.655
TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES AT THAT

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.190
LOCAL LEVEL IF WE CONTINUE TO

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:44.993
CREATE PROGRAMS THAT ARE COSTING

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.028
WILL CONTINUE TO SEE A A

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:46.895
DEGRADATION.

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:48.730
OF THE SERVICES THAT WERE ABLE

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:49.598
TO PROVIDE.

01:17:49.664 --> 01:17:51.533
THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I THINK

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.934
IT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.603
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN FACED

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:55.771
BY THIS COMMITTEE.

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:57.172
SINCE THIS IS A POLICY THAT SETS

01:17:57.239 --> 01:18:00.542
THE STAGE FOR THE APPROPRIATION

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:01.877
ACTION.

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:03.945
I I WOULD LOVE HIM.

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:05.614
I WOULD SUGGEST LOOKING AT AT AT

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.748
THE SLIMMEST BIGELOW.

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.016
AND THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A A

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:09.918
A A DEMOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE BUT

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:10.886
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:13.522
WAYNE IN MY MIND FOR A BIT --

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:15.590
NOW AND THAT IS THE IDEA THAT

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:17.526
SOMETIMES WE REDUCE TAXES ON

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:19.594
BUSINESSES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.029
IT CREATES MORE ECONOMIC REVENUE.

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:23.498
SELF IF WE CREATE PROGRAMS THAT

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:24.933
BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO THESE

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.902
PARKS WE ARE ALSO CREATING

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.770
REVENUE IN TERMS OF THE PARKING

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:30.605
THAT THEY PAY ANY ENTRANCES ANY

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:31.573
FEES.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.008
BUT WE PASSED A LAW LAST YEAR

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:34.376
THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS STATE PARKS

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:36.144
TO NOW SELL MERCHANDISE TO HELP

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:38.080
OFFSET THOSE COSTS WHICH WILL BE

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:40.015
IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR.

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.416
SO WE'VE BEEN STEADILY WORKING

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:44.086
AT WAYS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:45.821
MAKE SURE THAT THAT OUR OUR

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:48.890
STATE PARKS AND RESOURCES ARE

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.625
ACTUALLY MAINTAINED.

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:51.293
A IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:53.095
OVERNIGHT BUT WE'RE HOPING THAT

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:55.197
IF WE ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:56.965
THESE PLACES AND THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:18:57.032 --> 01:18:59.134
SEE THE BEAUTY OF CALIFORNIA.

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:02.003
WE CAN CREATE A PRIORITY AS TO

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.172
WHAT THIS IS.

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:04.806
AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND I

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:05.974
WOULD LOOK AT IT THE SAME WAY IF

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:06.741
WE REDUCE.

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.677
TAXES WE STIMULATE THE ECONOMY

01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:10.645
WHICH CREATES AN ECONOMIC GROWTH

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.380
AND A BILL WHICH IN TURN

01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:13.815
REVOLVES A CIRCLE.

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.217
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE WERE

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:17.219
TALKING ABOUT GETTING FUNDING

01:19:17.285 --> 01:19:18.820
FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD EVEN

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.089
PUT THE GAS OR HAVE THE VEHICLE.

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:22.958
THERE'S A MECHANISM FOR CREATING

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.793
A A A PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.094
SYSTEM FOR THEM TO GET THERE

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:28.763
LIKELY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY.

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.098
PARKING ISSUES LIKELY THEY DON'T

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:32.634
HAVE MUCH IF ANY MONEY TO SPEND

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:34.035
FOR THOSE RESOURCE THOSE.

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.671
FACILITIES INSIDE THE PARKS I I

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:37.873
WOULD GRANT THAT THAT THAT'S A

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.442
GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STE.

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:42.511
YOUTH OR INDIVIDUALS TO GO TO

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:43.812
THESE PARTS I'M WITH YOU ON THAT

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:44.913
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:46.648
THAT OCCUR BUT WHAT I REALLY

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:48.783
MISTER CHAIR THINK IS MORE WE

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:49.417
NEED TO LOOK AT THIS FROM A MORE

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:50.218
HOLISTIC.

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:52.087
STANDPOINT AGAIN WHAT COMES

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:52.921
FIRST.

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.890
THE CARD FOR THE HORSE WE JUST

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:56.358
GOT TO FIGURE ALL THAT OUT I'M

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:58.226
I'M WITH YOU LIKE 90% THE WAYS

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.462
JUST ONE LITTLE ELEMENT HERE

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:01.129
THAT'S AYE LOOKING.

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:03.431
ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE A QUESTION

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:04.232
FROM A SUMMER PERSON.

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:05.333
THANK YOU AND I'M NOT GOING TO

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.235
MAKE THIS ABOUT ECONOMICS BUT

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:09.337
ABOUT JUSTICE AND THE REALITY IS

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:10.605
WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A RURAL%

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:11.806
COMMUNITY AREN'T IRVINE

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.074
COMMUNITY WHETHER YOU'RE RICH OR

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:17.145
POOR WE'RE ALL PAYING FOR THIS

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:17.445
BOND.

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:18.346
AND THE REALITY IS THAT THESE

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:19.681
PARKS ARE BEING USED WITH OR

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.149
WITHOUT THAT MAINTAINS BUT IT'S

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:22.484
ONLY BEING USED BY FOUR TWO CAN

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:23.952
AFFORD. TO GET THEMSELVES ARE

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:25.420
THE WE ARE ALL PAYING FOR THESE

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:26.788
PARTS THE RESPECTIVE A LETTER

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:27.822
INCOME LOOKS LIKE AT THE IN THE

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:28.657
DAY.

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.158
AND AS A BY JUSTICE TO MAKE SURE

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:31.426
THAT THEY WERE PAYING FOR THESE

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:32.861
PARTS AND COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:34.262
THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:34.863
PARKS.

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:35.397
AGAIN EVERY REMOVE THOSE

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:37.599
BARRIERS IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:38.700
WILL DO A LITTLE BIT OF MATH FOR

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:40.035
YOU IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE WHEN

01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:41.336
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:42.671
AND SO YOU STILL HAVE THE BULK

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.739
OF THE MONEY OVER 95% OF THE

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.308
MONEY TO GO TOWARDS THINGS LIKE

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:47.776
MAINTENANCE TO ENSURE THAT AT

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:49.744
THE SAME TIME WE HAVE JUSTICE

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:51.246
BECAUSE OTHERWISE.

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:51.880
YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE USING THE

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:54.849
PARK WHO PAID FOR IT BUT THE

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:55.817
DOLLARS THAT THEY PUT IN

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:56.885
PLEASANT DOLLARS AT COMMUNITIES

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:57.953
LIKE MINE PUT IN BUT ARE NOT

01:20:58.019 --> 01:20:58.920
ENJOYING THE PARK.

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:00.355
AND SETS ABOUT ENSURING THAT IN

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.324
THE PROCESS WE CAN MULTI TASK.

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:03.625
AND MAYBE AS A WOMAN I JUST I'M

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:06.261
GOOD AT MULTI TASKING -- AND WE

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:07.329
COULD DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:09.598
IT'S A SMALL TINY INVESTMENT TO

01:21:09.664 --> 01:21:10.932
ENSURE WE HAVE JUSTICE IN THIS

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:12.067
PROCESS.

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.602
AND SO I APPRECIATE WHERE THIS

01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:16.037
BILL IS GOING I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:16.905
HAVE BEEN SIGNED AND HAVING MY

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:18.273
COMMUNITY PARTAKE IN THESE

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.174
ACTIVITIES.

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:20.742
NOT ONLY ARE WE PARK PART OF MY

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:22.143
DISTRICT AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:22.744
NEED TO ADDRESS IN THIS PLAN

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:23.945
ALSO HELPS WITH THAT.

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:25.680
BUT WE ARE ALSO NEED TO MAKE

01:21:25.747 --> 01:21:26.881
SURE THAT WE'RE GOOD STEWARDS OF

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:28.617
THE ENVIRONMENT OF AND WHAT WE

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:29.784
LOVE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IDLE

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.553
SPEECHES THOSE MOUNTAINS.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.954
ON INTO WE NEED TO GET US OUT

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.189
THERE AND AT IN A DAY I DON'T

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:35.757
HAVE A SINGLE MOUNTAIN AND EVEN

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:36.691
THOUGH THAT HAVE A POSITIVE

01:21:36.758 --> 01:21:44.699
SLOPE OF ANY SORT OF MY DISTRICT --

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:45.300
AND I DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE A

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:46.534
BEACH.

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:48.203
AND SO I APPRECIATE WE'RE GOING

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.837
WITH THIS I THINK IT'S A SMALL

01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:50.038
INVESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:51.039
HAVE A JUST PROCESS AS ARE DOING

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:51.640
THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS THAT IS

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:52.974
SO BADLY NEEDED TO THAT WE ARE

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.075
ALL FAITH.

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:55.277
AND AT THOSE.

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.279
FIVE THANK YOU.

01:21:57.345 --> 01:21:58.079
I THINK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU

01:21:58.146 --> 01:21:58.513
SEE NO.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.848
ONE I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU

01:21:59.914 --> 01:22:00.448
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:02.884
AT NEW WE'VE DISCUSSED THE BOND --

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:04.919
THAT WAS -- AUTHORED BY SENATOR

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:05.854
DE LEóN.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.590
AND FOUR FOUR BILLION FOUR POINT

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:09.291
ONE BILLION I THINK WAS THE

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:11.326
TOTAL THE BOND THAT THIS ISSUE

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:14.429
THAT WAS PUT FORWARD CREATIVELY --

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.831
TO CREATE -- PROGRAMS FOR AXIS I

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:19.067
THINK WAS BRILLIANT -- I'D LIKE

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:20.669
FOR US TO MAY BE ALSO IN THE

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:23.038
SHORT TERM ADDRESSED THE ISSUE

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:23.872
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:26.107
IS PUTTING FORWARD TO MANY OF

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:26.941
THE LOCAL GROUPS AND

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:29.010
ORGANISATIONS MAYBE IT'S A

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:30.779
LETTER THAT WE ALL CAN SIGN ON

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.047
TO LETTING THEM KNOW THAT --

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.482
THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:35.684
IN OF COURSE THIS BILLS JUST

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.420
ALIGNING YOU KNOW THAT EFFORT --

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:40.121
BUT I I LINE MY SELF WITH THE

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:41.823
COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE --

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:47.228
CRISTINA GARCIA AND PROUD -- TO

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:48.897
A CA TO THE BILL LIGHT A WANT

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:49.564
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTS THAT

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:50.665
HAVE BEEN MADE BY OUR COLLEAGUE

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:51.599
OF MR BIGELOW -- BUT THERE IS A

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.234
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY HERE

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:55.670
NOT ENOUGH -- TO DO THE DEFERRED

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.372
MAINTENANCE AND I I TO THE

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:58.707
BELIEVE LIKE I THINK THAT.

01:22:58.773 --> 01:22:59.808
THE A DEMOCRAT WITH THE

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:01.910
ENTREPRENEURIAL PERSPECTIVE --

FUNDS ARE SMALL IMPOUNDMENTS

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:21.015
THERE'S A LITTLE DAMP FEW FEET

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:23.050
HIGH SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:24.418
EIGHTEEN MILLION ACRES OF

RANGELAND IN CALIFORNIA.

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:27.255
THEY CATCH WATER IN THE WINTER

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:28.523
AND HOLD IT OVER TO THE DRY

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:29.991
SEASON WHICH IS PROVIDES

01:30:30.057 --> 01:30:31.058
IMPORTANT.

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:32.693
AGRA NAMIK BENEFITS KEEPS CATTLE

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.695
OUT IN THE AREA IN THE LANDSCAPE

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:36.697
SO THEY CAN BETTER UTILIZE FEED

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:37.799
AND IT ALSO PROVIDES SOME

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:39.767
IMPORTANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:42.003
BENEFITS IT'S WATER TO DRINK FOR

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:43.771
ALL KINDS OF CRITTERS DURING THE

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:45.540
DRY SEASON AS WE KNOW WATERS.

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:46.974
THE LIFE -- LIFEBLOOD

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.609
PARTICULARLY IN IN THE DRY

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:49.977
SEASON WHICH IS A LITTLE HARD TO

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.113
IMAGINE I GUESS RIGHT NOW BUT IT

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.381
WILL COME BACK AGAIN.

01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:56.851
AND IT'S ALSO HABITAT FOR SOME

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:58.386
IMPORTANT AMPHIBIANS.

01:30:58.452 --> 01:30:59.620
IN ADDITION -- FIRE SUPPRESSION

01:30:59.687 --> 01:31:00.121
IS THE KEY.

01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:01.856
OF VALUE TO THIS ARE OFTEN

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:04.926
UTILIZED IN WILDFIRES BY

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:06.727
HELICOPTERS PARTICULARLY.

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:08.396
AND ALSO IT -- IT'S ANOTHER WAY

01:31:08.462 --> 01:31:09.931
TO SLOW WATER ACROSS THE

01:31:09.997 --> 01:31:11.465
LANDSCAPE WHICH IS IMPORTANT.

01:31:11.532 --> 01:31:12.567
FOR CALIFORNIANS WERE WORKING ON

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:15.036
OUR GROUNDWATER SYSTEMS AND IN

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:16.537
MY OPINION THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:18.873
INSTANCES WHERE A RESOURCE IS

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.641
GOOD FOR AGRICULTURE AND THE

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:21.742
ENVIRONMENT.

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.411
THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CURRENT

01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:25.112
SYSTEM ISN'T WORKABLE.

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:27.481
IT'S UNNECESSARILY EXPENSIVE AND

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:29.350
BURDENSOME FOR LANDOWNERS AND

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:30.551
FOR THE STATE.

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:32.753
BASICALLY THE COST BENEFIT RATIO

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.322
IS OUT OF WHACK IF YOU WILL.

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:35.823
THIS STATE SPENDS TOO MUCH TIME

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:37.058
AND MONEY DOING WHAT THE

01:31:37.124 --> 01:31:38.559
REGISTRATIONS IN THE LAND OWNERS

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.261
DO THE SAME TO THE POINT WHERE --

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:42.029
IT MIGHT IN SOME CASES IT MAY

01:31:42.096 --> 01:31:43.731
MAKE MORE SENSE FOR THEM TO JUST

01:31:43.798 --> 01:31:44.665
TEAR AMOUNT.

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:47.301
SO AB FOR FORTY EIGHT SEEKS TO

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:48.636
BETTER ALIGN THE COSTS AND

02:23:20.258 --> 02:23:21.326
I THINK THAT THERE'S A

FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT OVER

02:23:22.927 --> 02:23:24.362

02:23:28.733 --> 02:23:30.301
THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY -- I

02:23:30.368 --> 02:23:31.636
THINK THE AUDUBON HAS EXPRESSED

02:23:31.703 --> 02:23:33.137
THAT THE MOST THE RECENT

02:23:33.204 --> 02:23:35.173

02:23:35.239 --> 02:23:37.075
CONTRADICTS DECADES OF FEDERAL

02:23:37.141 --> 02:23:38.643

02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:40.545
REVERSED A LONGSTANDING

02:23:40.611 --> 02:23:41.946
INTERPRETATION OF THE MBTA.

02:23:42.013 --> 02:23:43.881
HOWEVER -- THIS INTERPRETATION

02:23:43.948 --> 02:23:45.550
WAS ONLY FORMALIZED BY THE OBAMA

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:47.085

02:23:47.151 --> 02:23:51.022
THE TRUMP -- DECISION CAME OUT.

02:23:51.089 --> 02:23:52.423
I BELIEVE THAT OUR INDUSTRIES

02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:53.625
BELIEVE THAT.

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:55.226
WE ALSO STAND ON GOOD FOOTING

02:23:55.293 --> 02:23:56.627
BECAUSE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE US

02:23:56.694 --> 02:23:57.829
COURT OF APPEALS IN THE FIFTH

02:23:57.895 --> 02:23:58.930

02:23:58.997 --> 02:24:00.865
THAT THE MBTA PROTECTION

02:24:00.932 --> 02:24:03.468

02:24:03.534 --> 02:24:05.036

02:24:11.542 --> 02:24:12.977
AND THE US COURT OF APPEALS FOR

02:24:13.044 --> 02:24:14.979
THE NINTH CIRCUIT SIMILARLY HELD

02:24:15.046 --> 02:24:16.581
THAT THE MBTA APPLIED ONLY TO

KILLING A MIGRATORY BIRDS.

02:24:30.061 --> 02:24:30.695
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS

02:24:30.762 --> 02:24:32.430

02:24:40.872 --> 02:24:42.707
THERE WAS A SHE WON A PORTION

02:24:42.774 --> 02:24:44.542
THAT SAID IS REMOVING A

02:24:44.609 --> 02:24:46.010
STRUCTURE FOR EXAMPLE A

02:24:46.077 --> 02:24:48.646
DILAPIDATED BARN KNOWN.

02:24:48.713 --> 02:24:50.014
WITH NO NESTING.

02:24:50.081 --> 02:24:51.482
FOR SORRY NO NESTING OWLS IN THE

02:24:51.549 --> 02:24:52.917
BARN WHICH WILL DIE IS THE

02:24:52.984 --> 02:24:56.487
DESTRUCTION OF THE OF THE BURN A

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:58.489
VIOLATION MBTA ANSWERED THIS

02:24:58.556 --> 02:24:59.690
WOULD NOT BE A VIOLATION OF THE

02:24:59.757 --> 02:25:00.591
MBTA.

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:01.592
REMOVING OR DESTROYING THE

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:02.994
STRUCTURE WOULD RARELY IF EVER

02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:04.929
BE THE ACT THAT HAS THE FEELING

02:25:04.996 --> 02:25:06.964
I'LL NESTLINGS AS ITS PURPOSE WE

02:25:07.031 --> 02:25:08.499
DON'T JUST WE DON'T AGREE WITH

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:09.367
THAT.

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:11.569
FAQ THAT CAME OUT ON THAT AND I

02:25:11.636 --> 02:25:12.036
DON'T KNOW THAT MANY

02:25:12.103 --> 02:25:13.871
ORGANIZATIONS WOULD STAND HERE

02:25:13.938 --> 02:25:14.305
SAYING THAT THEY'VE

02:25:14.372 --> 02:25:15.907
WHOLEHEARTEDLY APPROVE.

02:25:15.973 --> 02:25:18.042
OF WHAT THE FAQ WAS -- I THINK

02:25:18.109 --> 02:25:19.110
THAT THE AUDUBON HAS ALSO

02:25:19.177 --> 02:25:20.878
MENTION INCIDENT THAT THEY DON'T

02:25:20.945 --> 02:25:21.813
THINK THE MBTA WOULDN'T ALONG

02:25:21.879 --> 02:25:23.014
WITH NO LONGER APPLY TO

02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:24.482
CATASTROPHIC EVENTS.

02:25:24.549 --> 02:25:26.517
SUCH AS THE DEEPWATER HORIZON

02:25:26.584 --> 02:25:27.485
WHERE AN OIL SPILL.

02:25:27.552 --> 02:25:28.753
DESTROYED OR INJURED UP TO A

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:31.022
MILLION BIRDS SINCE INTENT WAS

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:33.024
NOT ORIGINALLY TO KILL THE BIRDS --

02:25:33.091 --> 02:25:33.891
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S

02:25:33.958 --> 02:25:35.226
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO

02:25:35.293 --> 02:25:38.162

02:25:41.532 --> 02:25:43.034
THAT IN THE PAST ESPECIALLY LAST

02:25:43.101 --> 02:25:46.704

02:25:52.110 --> 02:25:54.212

NOR ON THEIR ITS FORESTRY LISTED

02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:23.875
WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST STRICT

FORCE PRACTICE RULES IN IN THE

02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:27.945
NATION IF NOT IN THE WORLD.

02:26:28.012 --> 02:26:28.746
WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN WHAT IT

02:26:28.813 --> 02:26:30.548
IS THAT WE DO WE HAVE A GREAT

02:26:30.615 --> 02:26:33.451
CONCERN IN THIS BILL THAT --

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:34.685
AGRICULTURE HAS HAD A LONG

02:26:34.752 --> 02:26:36.020
STANDING DEFINITION WHICH

02:26:36.087 --> 02:26:37.788
PROVIDES FOR THE INCIDENTAL TAKE

02:26:37.855 --> 02:26:39.790
FOR ACTS THAT OCCUR ON A FARM OR

02:26:39.857 --> 02:26:45.463

OTHERWISE LAWFUL ROUTINE AND

ONGOING AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES.

02:26:47.532 --> 02:26:48.432
WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT --

02:26:48.499 --> 02:26:49.367
IN ORDER FOR OUR OPPOSITION TO

02:26:49.433 --> 02:26:50.468

02:26:52.203 --> 02:26:53.804
PART OF THE ON GOING AND AND

02:26:53.871 --> 02:26:55.239

02:26:55.306 --> 02:26:57.875
AGRICULTURE FOR PURPOSES OF MBTA

02:26:57.942 --> 02:26:59.744
ONLY -- AND THAT'S OUR

02:26:59.810 --> 02:27:01.913
OPPOSITION.

02:27:01.979 --> 02:27:03.714
GOOD MORNING NO -- KRAMER'S THE

02:27:03.781 --> 02:27:04.182
CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU

02:27:04.248 --> 02:27:05.750
FEDERATION.

02:27:05.816 --> 02:27:07.952
I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THE

02:27:08.019 --> 02:27:10.087
SIGNIFICANT HABITAT THAT

02:27:10.154 --> 02:27:11.956
CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE AND

02:27:12.023 --> 02:27:13.658
CALIFORNIA'S FORCE PROVIDE TO

02:27:13.724 --> 02:27:15.059
BIRDS AND MANY OTHER WILDLIFE

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:16.060
SPECIES.

02:27:16.127 --> 02:27:19.030
AND IF IT IF NOT FOR THESE OPEN

02:27:19.096 --> 02:27:20.198
SPACES.

02:27:20.264 --> 02:27:20.998
WE WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:23.367
DEVELOPMENT AND WE WOULD HAVE A

02:27:23.434 --> 02:27:25.937
LOT LESS WILDLIFE HABITAT.

02:27:26.003 --> 02:27:27.939
BUT PROVIDING THAT HABITAT

02:27:28.005 --> 02:27:29.974
CREATES REGULATORY RISKS AND

02:27:30.041 --> 02:27:32.109
UNCERTAINTY FOR THE PRODUCTION

02:27:32.176 --> 02:27:33.177

QUO.

02:27:41.285 --> 02:27:42.920
IF YOU LOOK AT LINE TWELVE IT

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:44.355
GIVES THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

02:27:44.422 --> 02:27:46.324

02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:47.992
A REGULATION THAT IS CONSISTENT

02:27:48.059 --> 02:27:48.826
WITH.

02:27:48.893 --> 02:27:52.196
OR MORE PROTECTIVE THAN RULES

02:27:52.263 --> 02:27:54.098
AND REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE

UNDER THE FEDERAL ACT.

02:27:57.768 --> 02:28:00.271
THAT'S WHERE OUR CONCERN LIES.

02:28:00.338 --> 02:28:01.772
IS GIVING THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH

02:28:01.839 --> 02:28:04.242
AND WILDLIFE THE AUTHORITY TO GO

02:28:05.876 --> 02:28:07.945
THE EXISTING AND FORMER

02:28:08.012 --> 02:28:10.147
INTERPRETATION OF THE MIGRATORY

02:28:10.214 --> 02:28:11.582
BIRD TREATY ACT.

02:28:11.649 --> 02:28:13.951
SO WE HAVE TO SPECIFIC CONCERNS

02:28:14.018 --> 02:28:15.019
IN THAT AREA.

02:28:15.086 --> 02:28:17.088
FIRST THERE ARE LONG STANDING

02:28:17.154 --> 02:28:18.489
PROVISIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL ACT

02:28:18.556 --> 02:28:20.258
THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE WELL

02:28:20.324 --> 02:28:20.658
BEFORE THE CURRENT

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:22.960
ADMINISTRATION THAT ALLOWS FOR

02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:24.228
THE TAKE OF CERTAIN MIGRATORY

02:28:24.295 --> 02:28:25.162

02:28:25.229 --> 02:28:27.832
THAT DAMAGE CROPS OR PREVENT A

02:28:27.898 --> 02:28:29.300
HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK.

02:28:29.367 --> 02:28:32.169
THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE

02:28:32.236 --> 02:28:35.106
DEPARTMENT TO ACCEPT THOSE LONG

02:28:35.172 --> 02:28:36.841
STANDING PROVISIONS.

02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:38.209
THE OTHER PIECE THAT'S NOT THAT

02:28:38.276 --> 02:28:39.977
IS CONCERNING AND MORE

02:28:40.044 --> 02:28:41.879
CONCERNING IN FACT IS JUST

02:28:41.946 --> 02:28:43.347

02:28:48.753 --> 02:28:50.221
WHAT IS IN?

02:28:50.288 --> 02:28:51.922
THE CURRENT AND FORMER

02:28:51.989 --> 02:28:52.490
INTERPRETATION MIGHT DRAPER

02:28:52.556 --> 02:28:54.825
TREATY ACT SO OUR CONCERN IS

02:28:54.892 --> 02:28:55.860
THAT.

02:28:55.926 --> 02:28:57.228
GIVEN THE RISKS THAT WE HAVE

02:28:57.295 --> 02:28:58.596
BEEN HARVESTING CROPS OR

02:28:58.663 --> 02:29:00.298
MANAGING OUR FORESTS OR MANAGING

02:29:00.364 --> 02:29:01.732
THE LANDS THAT THERE IS

02:29:01.799 --> 02:29:03.334
POTENTIAL FOR TAKE AND THAT THE

02:29:03.401 --> 02:29:05.002
DEPARTMENT MAY NOT ALLOW FOR

02:29:05.069 --> 02:29:06.304
THAT WHICH CREATES GREAT

02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:07.838
REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY FOR

02:29:07.905 --> 02:29:09.173

CALIFORNIA.

02:29:10.541 --> 02:29:11.809
AND IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT

02:29:11.876 --> 02:29:13.611
WE OPPOSE THE BILL -- I WOULD

BACK WITHOUT THIS BILL CURRENT

02:45:15.205 --> 02:45:16.740

APPLIES TO ENVIRONMENTAL

02:45:31.421 --> 02:45:32.822
PROTECTIONS PROTECTING OUR FOR

PRESS THE TECHNO COMMUNITY.

02:45:35.492 --> 02:45:36.426
NOW.

02:45:36.493 --> 02:45:38.795
AS HER LUCK AMARE ONE I INDUSTRY

02:45:38.862 --> 02:45:40.397
ALSO WE ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT

02:45:40.463 --> 02:45:41.598
CALIFORNIA LAW AND THE FEDERAL

02:45:41.665 --> 02:45:43.933
AND WE AT THAT HAS CREATED A LOT

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.403
ABOUT YOU KNOW PROBLEMS TO SOLVE

02:45:46.469 --> 02:45:48.071
THIS MAY BE AN UP AND ON THE

02:45:48.138 --> 02:45:48.805
HILL.

02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:55.111
CONFLICTING ISSUE AND THE HOW --

02:45:55.178 --> 02:45:55.912
WE MAY RUN INTO LAW.

02:45:55.979 --> 02:45:58.014
YEAH [inaudible]

02:45:58.081 --> 02:45:59.816
MANY OTHER.

02:45:59.883 --> 02:46:02.218
ON INTENDED CONSEQUENCES UP BY

02:46:02.285 --> 02:46:03.119
CREATING OUR IN ALL THE

02:46:03.186 --> 02:46:04.454
REGULATIONS WELL THE DIFFERENCE

02:46:04.521 --> 02:46:05.822
IS THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW --

02:46:05.889 --> 02:46:07.424
CANNABIS HAS NEVER BEEN LEGAL UP

02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:10.060
THE MBTA WAS FEDERAL LAW FOR A

02:46:10.126 --> 02:46:10.927
HUNDRED YEARS UP UNTIL TWO YEARS

02:46:10.994 --> 02:46:13.196
AGO -- AND SO I THERE'S A BIG

02:46:13.263 --> 02:46:14.531
DISTINCTION THERE WERE BASICALLY

02:46:14.597 --> 02:46:16.866
UP STRENGTHENING A RULE THAT

02:46:16.933 --> 02:46:17.667
CURRENTLY EXIST EVEN NOW STILL

02:46:17.734 --> 02:46:20.403
THE MBTA STILL IN FORCE OF THE

02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:21.171
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS THIS

02:46:21.237 --> 02:46:22.906
BEEN NARROWED DRAMATICALLY.

02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:23.907
SO THIS IS JUST A A A

02:46:23.973 --> 02:46:26.710
STRENGTHENING OF CURRENT FEDERAL

02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:31.081
LAW.

02:46:31.147 --> 02:46:32.048
IF I COULD ADD TO SERVE.

02:46:32.115 --> 02:46:34.684
AMONG THE TO THERE.

02:46:34.751 --> 02:46:35.251
THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF CODE

02:46:35.318 --> 02:46:36.252
INCLUDING FISHING GAME CODE

02:46:36.319 --> 02:46:36.886
THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED WHICH MAKES

02:46:36.953 --> 02:46:38.421
IT ILLEGAL TO TAKE.

02:46:38.488 --> 02:46:40.924
NATIVE BIRDS AT THIRTY FIVE OH

02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:41.558
THREE WHICH LEADS TO PER BIRDS

02:46:41.624 --> 02:46:42.926
NESTS AND EGGS THIRTY FIVE OH

02:46:42.992 --> 02:46:43.493
THREE WHICH SPECIFICALLY A

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:44.227
RAPTOR.

02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:45.395
SO THERE'S A LOT OF PARTS OF THE

02:46:45.462 --> 02:46:47.130
CALIFORNIA CODE THAT PROVIDE

02:46:47.197 --> 02:46:48.898
THESE FLAT PROHIBITIONS ON THE

02:46:48.965 --> 02:46:51.234
TAKE OF MIGRATORY BIRDS AND HAVE

02:46:51.301 --> 02:46:52.001
FOR DECADES.

02:46:52.068 --> 02:46:52.969
AND SO THE CLICK WHAT WE'RE

02:46:53.036 --> 02:46:54.037
TRYING TO SOLVE HERE IS THAT NOW

02:46:54.104 --> 02:46:56.206
THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE FEDERAL

02:46:56.272 --> 02:46:57.907
INTERPRETATION OF MBTA THAT IS

02:46:57.974 --> 02:47:00.076
INTRODUCED THIS INCONGRUITY

02:47:00.143 --> 02:47:00.677
POTENTIALLY.

02:47:00.744 --> 02:47:02.512
WITHIN THE FIT WITHIN THE STATE

02:47:02.579 --> 02:47:03.446
FISH AND GAME CODE.

02:47:03.513 --> 02:47:04.714
BUT THOSE DOES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

02:47:04.781 --> 02:47:05.982
THERE AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

02:47:06.049 --> 02:47:09.219
THE THE RIGHT OF THE STATE -- TO

02:47:09.285 --> 02:47:09.819
MANAGE ATTENTION WILDLIFE IS

02:47:09.886 --> 02:47:11.755
EMBEDDED IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND

02:47:11.821 --> 02:47:12.822
RECOGNIZED BY THE US SUPREME

02:47:12.889 --> 02:47:14.290
COURT IS REALLY PROVINCE OF EACH

02:47:14.357 --> 02:47:15.058
STATE.

02:47:15.125 --> 02:47:16.526
AS PART OF ITS SOVEREIGN RIGHT

02:47:16.593 --> 02:47:18.161
SO WE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE IN

02:47:18.228 --> 02:47:19.896
THAT RESPECT -- THE WE HAVE THE

02:47:19.963 --> 02:47:24.634
AUTHORITY TO DECIDE HOW TO

02:47:24.701 --> 02:47:25.235
REGULATE OUR FISH AND WILDLIFE

02:47:25.301 --> 02:47:27.237
IN THE STATE.

02:47:27.303 --> 02:47:32.575

MAKING THE STOPPED.

02:49:04.667 --> 02:49:06.402
AND THEN NOW.

THE STATE WATER BOARD IS

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:10.874
CONSIDERING THEIR OWN RULES --

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:11.774
AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT ARE

02:49:11.841 --> 02:49:14.010

02:49:37.433 --> 02:49:38.768
SPECIFIC CASE I THINK IT'S

02:49:38.835 --> 02:49:40.336
REALLY MORE ABOUT UNINTENTIONAL

02:49:40.403 --> 02:49:42.272
TAKE.

02:49:42.338 --> 02:49:43.773
RIGHT AN INCIDENTAL TAKE.

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:46.109
AND CERTAINLY NOBODY'S OUT THERE

02:49:46.175 --> 02:49:47.243
GOING MAN WE WANT.

02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:48.978
TO YOU KNOW JUST ANNIHILATE BIRD

02:49:49.045 --> 02:49:50.013
POPULATIONS.

02:49:50.079 --> 02:49:52.315
YOU KNOW AS AS AS A HUNTER AS A

02:49:52.382 --> 02:49:54.817
AS A MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA

02:49:54.884 --> 02:49:56.519
WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION WHICH IS A

02:49:56.586 --> 02:49:58.488
SUPPORTER OF YOUR BILL -- WE

02:49:58.555 --> 02:50:00.256
WANT TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF OF

02:50:00.323 --> 02:50:01.925
OUR WATER FALLON OUR IN OUR BIRD

02:50:01.991 --> 02:50:03.993
POPULATIONS IN THE STATE'S BIG

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:06.229
PART OF THE ECONOMY IT'S AND

02:50:06.296 --> 02:50:08.531
JUST BY VIRTUE OF THE SPECIES

02:50:08.598 --> 02:50:13.269
ITSELF IS CRITICAL RIGHT -- BUT

02:50:13.336 --> 02:50:15.538
ALSO IN IN CONDUCTING.

02:50:15.605 --> 02:50:17.173
ROUTINE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES NOW

02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:18.441
WITH THE BURGEONING SOLAR

02:50:18.508 --> 02:50:22.245
INDUSTRY AND WIND INDUSTRY RIGHT.

02:50:22.312 --> 02:50:23.346
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME

02:50:23.413 --> 02:50:26.015
INCIDENTAL TAKES THAT ARE NOT

02:50:26.082 --> 02:50:28.284
INTENTIONAL OR NOT TRYING.

02:50:28.351 --> 02:50:31.387
TO YOU KNOW -- YOU'RE NOT

02:50:31.454 --> 02:50:32.655
INTENSELY GOING OUT AND TRYING

02:50:32.722 --> 02:50:34.557
TO YOU KNOW HAVE AN IMPACT ON

02:50:34.624 --> 02:50:35.992
THAT BIRD POPULATION.

02:50:36.059 --> 02:50:38.328
BUT THIS IS GOING TO AND SO NOW

02:50:38.394 --> 02:50:38.895
WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO GET A

02:50:38.962 --> 02:50:40.930
LITTLE BIT OF REALLY FUN THAT

02:50:40.997 --> 02:50:42.131
ONLY TO HAVE A GO.

02:50:42.198 --> 02:50:44.033
RIGHT BACK.

02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:46.002
TO A MORE STRINGENT ENFORCEMENT

02:50:46.069 --> 02:50:48.371
OF THAT RIGHT SO.

02:50:48.438 --> 02:50:49.439
ARE YOU SEE YOU SEE WHERE I'M

02:50:49.505 --> 02:50:50.974
COMING FROM THERE I MEAN THERE'S

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:52.609
CAN WE GET A BREAK.

02:50:52.675 --> 02:50:53.876
WELL CAN I GUESS WHERE I'M GUY I

02:50:53.943 --> 02:50:54.911
MEAN LOOK AT THAT.

02:50:54.978 --> 02:50:56.379
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH.

02:50:56.446 --> 02:50:57.580
COMPLAINTS THERE'S BEEN OVER THE

02:50:57.647 --> 02:50:59.148
LAST FORTY YEARS FROM INDUSTRY

02:50:59.215 --> 02:51:00.750
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS WAS

02:51:00.817 --> 02:51:01.551
BEEN IN PLACE.

02:51:01.618 --> 02:51:03.786
THE ROLE BY NECESSITY HAS TO BE

02:51:03.853 --> 02:51:04.954
REGARDING INSTEAD I'LL TAKE

02:51:05.021 --> 02:51:07.390
BECAUSE INTENTIONALLY TAKES

02:51:07.457 --> 02:51:08.057
ALREADY ILLEGAL.

02:51:08.124 --> 02:51:09.559
UNLESS YOU HAVE A PERMIT.

02:51:09.626 --> 02:51:10.793
SO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY INCIDENTAL

02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:11.527
TAKE IS HOW YOU PROTECT

02:51:11.594 --> 02:51:13.563
MIGRATORY BIRDS AND HAS BEEN.

02:51:13.630 --> 02:51:15.064
A TREATY FOR A HUNDRED YEARS

02:51:15.131 --> 02:51:17.533
IT'S BEEN FEDERAL PRACTICE FOR

02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:18.534
FORTY YEARS HAS BEEN THE STATE'S

02:51:18.601 --> 02:51:20.370
PRACTICE FOR DECADES.

02:51:20.436 --> 02:51:22.472
AND SO THIS IS JUST SAYING

02:51:22.538 --> 02:51:25.141
EVERYTHING'S WORKING JUST FINE.

02:51:25.208 --> 02:51:26.309
WHY YOU KNOW BLOW A AND THIS IS

02:51:26.376 --> 02:51:28.144
NOT JUST A SLIGHT MODIFICATION

02:51:28.211 --> 02:51:30.246
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY GETTING RID

02:51:30.313 --> 02:51:31.547
OF ANY RULE REGARDING AS THAT'LL

02:51:31.614 --> 02:51:32.749
TAKE?

02:51:32.815 --> 02:51:34.384
WHICH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE

02:51:34.450 --> 02:51:36.052
AGAIN OUR INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN

02:51:36.119 --> 02:51:37.253
THRIVING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING

02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:39.255
THAT OTHERS HAVE BEST PRACTICES

02:51:39.322 --> 02:51:40.957
LET'S TRY TO MITIGATE IT NO

02:51:41.024 --> 02:51:42.525
ONE'S BEEN PROSECUTED OPENS

02:51:42.592 --> 02:51:42.759
BERMAN.

02:51:42.825 --> 02:51:44.394
YOU WILL FIND I MEAN IT'S REALLY

02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:46.462
ABOUT JUST MAKING SURE THAT

02:51:46.529 --> 02:51:48.231
WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN AND

02:51:48.297 --> 02:51:49.365
WORKING WITH OUR DEPARTMENT

02:51:49.432 --> 02:51:51.334
MAKES WOULD BE THE BEST WE CAN --

02:51:51.401 --> 02:51:53.336
IT AND THAT'S WHAT HAS BEEN THE

02:51:53.403 --> 02:51:56.806
PRACTICE AND SO I DIDN'T HEAR AN

02:51:56.873 --> 02:51:57.173
OUTCRY BEFORE.

02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:59.042
IN A DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND

02:51:59.108 --> 02:52:01.010
SEVENTEEN OR BEFORE FEBRUARY TWO

02:52:01.077 --> 02:52:01.644
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OF THE TRUMP

02:52:01.711 --> 02:52:02.412
MINISTRATION TWO WEEKS INTO THE

02:52:02.478 --> 02:52:04.647
MINISTRATION ALL OF A SUDDEN.

02:52:04.714 --> 02:52:05.982
COUNTERING THE PRACTICE OF

02:52:06.049 --> 02:52:07.283
ADMINISTRATIONS BACK TO THE

02:52:07.350 --> 02:52:10.119
NIXON ADMINISTRATION DECIDED TO

02:52:10.186 --> 02:52:13.122
STOP ENFORCING -- AND THEN

02:52:13.189 --> 02:52:13.923
CHANGED WITH THE THE

02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:15.358
INTERPRETATION ALTOGETHER --

02:52:15.425 --> 02:52:16.993
THERE WASN'T A BIG OUTCRY FROM

02:52:17.060 --> 02:52:18.428
INDUSTRY WHETHER BE ABITIBI

02:52:18.494 --> 02:52:25.101
SOLAR OF A YOU BE TIMBER.

02:52:25.168 --> 02:52:26.769
THE LAST FORTY YEARS.

02:52:26.836 --> 02:52:28.337
IN SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:52:28.404 --> 02:52:29.338
WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT OUR

02:52:29.405 --> 02:52:29.939
INDUSTRY KNOWS HOW TO DO IT.

02:52:30.006 --> 02:52:30.807
AND OF COURSE OUR INDUSTRY TO

02:52:30.873 --> 02:52:32.141
THE BEST THEY CAN UPDATE THE WE

02:52:32.208 --> 02:52:32.642
HAVE SOME OF THE BEST.

02:52:32.709 --> 02:52:34.110
OF MITIGATION PRACTICES IN THE

02:52:34.177 --> 02:52:35.611
WORLD IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST

02:52:35.678 --> 02:52:36.946
WANNA MAKE SURE THE CONTINUE.

02:52:37.013 --> 02:52:38.748
AND NOT ROLL THEM BACK A IT DOES

02:52:38.815 --> 02:52:40.183
IT DOES PRACTICES WERE IN PLACE

02:52:40.249 --> 02:52:41.751
AND THEY'RE IN PLACE BECAUSE THE

02:52:41.818 --> 02:52:43.519
MBTA NOT BECAUSE THE MBTA'S IN A

02:52:43.586 --> 02:52:44.854
COME AFTER WHAT THE HAMMER.

02:52:44.921 --> 02:52:46.022
BUT THE MBTA'S HAS US WORK

02:52:46.089 --> 02:52:47.724
TOGETHER MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING

02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:49.258
THE BEST WE CAN TO PROTECT.

02:52:49.325 --> 02:52:50.860
OF THESE MIGRATORY BIRDS IT'S A

02:52:50.927 --> 02:52:53.196
SIMPLE AS THAT A IN AND I GET

02:52:53.262 --> 02:52:54.630
THAT WHEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:52:54.697 --> 02:52:56.566
GET OUT FROM REGULATION INDUSTRY

02:52:56.632 --> 02:53:02.138
WILL OFTENTIMES TAKE IT I AM.

02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:02.805
THAT'S FINE THAT'S THEIR

02:53:02.872 --> 02:53:04.373
PREROGATIVE PRESENT ARE PROBABLY

02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:06.342
TO TO TO SAY THAT'S OKAY -- IT

02:53:06.409 --> 02:53:07.810
OKAY THINGS ARE WORKING FINE

02:53:07.877 --> 02:53:08.411
GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

02:53:08.478 --> 02:53:09.512
INDUSTRY THE DEPARTMENT'S ALWAYS

02:53:09.579 --> 02:53:10.113
WORKED WELL WITH INDUSTRY IN

02:53:10.179 --> 02:53:12.281
THIS CASE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT'S

02:53:12.348 --> 02:53:13.416
BEEN THE CASE FOR DECADES.

02:53:13.483 --> 02:53:15.318
OUR STATE DEPARTMENT CAN'T

02:53:15.384 --> 02:53:16.619
DISABLE WE'RE JUST GONNA FALL

02:53:16.686 --> 02:53:17.120
THE GUIDANCE OF FEDERAL

02:53:17.186 --> 02:53:21.190
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY DECIDED

02:53:21.257 --> 02:53:23.826
TO COMPLETELY BUT CUT OUT ANY

02:53:23.893 --> 02:53:24.627
CONSIDERATION FOR INCIDENTAL

02:53:24.694 --> 02:53:24.994
TAKE WHICH IS.

02:53:25.061 --> 02:53:25.828
COMPLETELY COUNTER TO THE

02:53:25.895 --> 02:53:27.163
PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN IN

02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:28.264
EXISTENCE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:29.866
UNDER THE TREATY AT LEAST FOR

02:53:29.932 --> 02:53:31.768
DECADES UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND

02:53:31.834 --> 02:53:33.503
UNDER CALIFORNIA PRACTICE.

02:53:33.569 --> 02:53:35.271
I THINK THAT I THINK YOUR

02:53:35.338 --> 02:53:36.072
ARGUMENT THERE MAKES A LOT OF

02:53:36.139 --> 02:53:37.607
SENSE YOU KNOW AND AND AND IN

02:53:37.673 --> 02:53:40.476
TERMS OF HEY THIS IS HOW THINGS

02:53:40.543 --> 02:53:42.211
HAVE BEEN RIGHT -- WHAT I WOULD

02:53:42.278 --> 02:53:44.547
JUST?

02:53:44.614 --> 02:53:45.548
SAVE YOU AN AND I HOPE MAYBE

02:53:45.615 --> 02:53:47.383
SOME WE COULD WORK ON IS LIKE

02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:49.018
LET'S TRY AND KEEP THAT STATUS

02:53:49.085 --> 02:53:51.154
YOU KNOW AT LEAST KEEP THAT.

02:53:51.220 --> 02:53:52.588
THAT STATUS QUO.

02:53:52.655 --> 02:53:53.923
BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG PART OF

02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:55.158
THIS IS JUST THE UNCERTAINTY

02:53:55.224 --> 02:53:57.894
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UNDER.

02:53:57.960 --> 02:53:58.995
I THINK YOU MAY GET ARGUMENT HEY

02:53:59.061 --> 02:54:00.096
THERE'S NO UNCERTAINTY HERE

02:54:00.163 --> 02:54:01.798
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN THAT WAY RIGHT

02:54:01.864 --> 02:54:02.298
NOW.

02:54:02.365 --> 02:54:03.533
BUT LIKE FOR INSTANCE IN THESE

02:54:03.599 --> 02:54:04.934
WETLAND RULES THAT WERE ABOUT TO

02:54:05.001 --> 02:54:06.435
PROMULGATE WILL NOT THAT WE ARE

02:54:06.502 --> 02:54:08.171
BUT THAT THE REGULATORY BODIES

02:54:08.237 --> 02:54:11.474
WITHOUT OUR WITHOUT ANY OF OUR

02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:11.908
AND PUT IT REALLY.

02:54:11.974 --> 02:54:13.810
ARE ABOUT TO PROMULGATE THE

02:54:13.876 --> 02:54:14.410
STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

02:54:14.477 --> 02:54:19.148
BOARD -- YOU KNOW WE NEED THE

02:54:19.215 --> 02:54:20.483
BODY BEEN OPERATING AGAIN JUST

02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:21.818
AS YOU ARGUED WE'VE BEEN OPERATE

02:54:21.884 --> 02:54:23.219
UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT IT'S

02:54:23.286 --> 02:54:24.587
HEY THESE ARE THE RULES AND THEN

02:54:24.654 --> 02:54:25.421
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE GONNA

02:54:25.488 --> 02:54:25.822
LIKE.

02:54:25.888 --> 02:54:28.658
DRASTICALLY EXPAND RIGHT SO I

02:54:28.724 --> 02:54:29.192
THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY.

02:54:29.258 --> 02:54:34.096
A LOT OF MERIT TO WHAT YOU'RE

02:54:34.163 --> 02:54:35.264
SAYING IS LIKE HEY KEEP THINGS

02:54:35.331 --> 02:54:37.233
WHERE THEY'RE AT SO THE PEOPLE

02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:39.335
HAVE THAT EXPECTATION AND NO.

02:54:39.402 --> 02:54:41.103
WHAT'S COMING FORWARD.

02:54:41.170 --> 02:54:43.306
IS THAT I I AGREE 1100% ON I

02:54:43.372 --> 02:54:44.440
THINK THESE ARE NEW RULES AND

02:54:44.507 --> 02:54:45.975
WITH A 100% AS OPPOSED TO THE

02:54:46.042 --> 02:54:46.609
WEATHER WAS THE HOUSE CONCERNED

02:54:46.676 --> 02:54:48.945
ABOUT THESE ARE NEW RULES AND I

02:54:49.011 --> 02:54:50.479
AGREE I I I DON'T.

02:54:50.546 --> 02:54:51.848
THIS SHOULDN'T BE USED AS A NEW

02:54:51.914 --> 02:54:53.783
AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT TO

02:54:53.850 --> 02:54:55.151
THESE INTERVIEW THAT'S NOT WITH

02:54:55.218 --> 02:54:56.452
THE INTENTION IS REALLY IS AS

02:54:56.519 --> 02:54:57.486
HEY LET'S JUST KEEP DOING WHAT

02:54:57.553 --> 02:54:57.887
WE'VE BEEN DOING.

02:54:57.954 --> 02:54:59.488
THAT'S CODIFIED IN STATE LAW

02:54:59.555 --> 02:55:02.058
WHICH WE DIDN'T NEED TO DO UP

02:55:02.124 --> 02:55:03.392
UNTIL COVERED YEARS WE DIDN'T

02:55:03.459 --> 02:55:04.026
NEED TO CODIFY THE STATE LAW NOW

02:55:04.093 --> 02:55:05.061
WE NEED TO CODIFY IT JUST TO

02:55:05.127 --> 02:55:06.295
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:55:06.362 --> 02:55:07.964
CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE WAY

02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:08.764
WE'VE BEEN OPERATING AND SO

02:55:08.831 --> 02:55:10.433
THAT'S FULLY MY INTENTION.

02:55:10.499 --> 02:55:12.702
AGAIN -- TO WORK WITH ALL THESE

02:55:12.768 --> 02:55:13.870
INDUSTRIES TO MAKE FOR THE

02:55:13.936 --> 02:55:14.437
DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO WORK

02:55:14.503 --> 02:55:16.239
WITH THESE INDUSTRIES TO MAKE

02:55:16.305 --> 02:55:16.873
SURE THAT THEY CAN OPERATE IN A

02:55:16.939 --> 02:55:18.507
WAY THAT SUCCESSFUL AND WORKS

02:55:18.574 --> 02:55:19.208
FOR THEM.

02:55:19.275 --> 02:55:20.543
BUT AT LEAST HAS SOME BEST

02:55:20.610 --> 02:55:22.678
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN TERMS OF

02:55:22.745 --> 02:55:24.380
PRODUCING ABOUT A CELTIC KNOT

02:55:24.447 --> 02:55:25.214
ELIMINATING IT OTHER GOING TO

02:55:25.281 --> 02:55:26.382
BRING UP A LOT OF BIRDS ARE

02:55:26.449 --> 02:55:27.216
GOING TO DIE.

02:55:27.283 --> 02:55:28.451
THAT'S PART OF WHAT THESE

02:55:28.517 --> 02:55:30.386
INDUSTRIES THEY CAN'T HELP IT
