WHILE AGO MORE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. ONE I THINK EVERYONE HERE TODAY. AND THAT THANK MY MY COLLEAGUE FOR. WORKING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER AND HIS TEAM. AND HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM THE AIR BE AND OTHERS TO BE REGARDING THE PROGRESS AIR BE IS MAKING. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES. CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND TOXIC AIR TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. AND TO IMPROVE PUBLIC DATA ON THESE THE MISSIONS AS WE WORK TO REDUCE THEM TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH. OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. WELL THEY GOING TO COVER AIR BASE PLAN TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS AS REFLECTED IN THE RECENTLY ADOPTED SCHOOL BEING PLAN. WHICH GIVES US THE CHANCE TO REVIEW THE ROLE OF CAP AND TRADE AS WELL AS THE RANGE OF DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTION MEASURES WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE FORTY PERCENT ADDITIONAL REDUCTION. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS OF THE PASS AB THE NAME THE EIGHT LAST YEAR. LAST JULY ABOUT AN OVERSUPPLY OF ALLOWANCE SAYS AFTER TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE IMPACT THAT THIS MAY HAVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY OF THAT MISSION CAP. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I'M ANXIOUS TO HEAR HOW THE AIR BE WILL MANAGE IT. HOWEVER I THINK WE ALL NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WITH THEIR HEART PRICE CEILING ON ALLOWANCES. INDIA THIRTY AIR BE HAVE TO SOLID DECISIONAL MONOPOLY ALLOWANCES AT THE SAME PRICE. WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A HARD CAP ON EMISSIONS IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND WE MOST LIKELY DID NOT HAVE THE MISSION CAPS ON INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES. THIS MAKES IT ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP FOCUS ON THE DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTION MEASURES AS A PRIMARY TWELVE TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. AND THAT THEY ARE BEACON TO NEED TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL AND ENHANCE MEASURES TO ACHIEVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S ALSO ALL THE MORE REASON TO MAKE SURE THAT AB SIX SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND OUR MOST POLLUTED BURNING COMMUNITIES. AIR BE AND THEY ARE DISTRICTS NEED TO MAKES. NAY TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND CREATIVE AS THEY DEVELOP MASTERS TO RESERVE DECADES A NEGLECT IN THESE COMMUNITIES. COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT HAVE BEEN TO ELECT A WASTELAND ALL MY LIFE LONGER. AT THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD NOT BE MAKING MATTERS WORSE RAISING CAP AND TRADE REVENUE TO FIND HOUSING EDGY SINCE NEXT TO FREEWAYS. AS IMPORTANT AS A B. SIX SEVENTEEN IS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT DOES NOT REPLACE THE FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATION THAT AIR BEHALF ON THEIR AB THIRTY TO. TO ENSURE THAT MEASURES TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COMPLIMENTS AIR QUALITY AND THE NOT LEAD TO LOCAL INCREASES IN OUR POLLUTION. WE LONG RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EQUITY IN OUR CLIMATE POLICIES AND WE KNOW THAT TRICKLE DOWN ENVIRONMENTALISM HAS SPILLED COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE FOR THAT KATE'S. WE MADE SOME GOOD PROGRESS BUT MUCH WORK REMAINS TO WISH I REMAIN SO SURE THAT OUR CLIMATE AND OUR POLICIES WORK EFFECTIVELY. TOGETHER AND NOT ONLY SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT ALSO FOR THE MOST NOTABLE HERE AT HOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WOULD HAVE MEANT CHAIRED WELCOME EVERYONE AGAIN. TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES. JOINT HEARING. THANK AND WELCOME MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL OF YOU THAT HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO BE HERE AS WELL. WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY THE CHAIR OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD MARY NICHOLS FOR THIS DISCUSSION TODAY. AND HER TEAM. ALONG WITH ROSS BROWN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS YOU ALL KNOW THE SCOPING PLAN. IS CALIFORNIA'S ROADMAP FOR ACHIEVING OUR AMBITIOUS TWENTY THIRTY EMISSION TARGETS. THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT STATE AGENCIES THE LEGISLATURE AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SHARE A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLAN. TO MOVE OUR STATE FORWARD WITH A R. B. IS THE STATE AND IT'S TAKING THE LEAD AGENCY ARE IN IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGIES. IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE. PLAN WORKS IN THAT WE MEET OUR TARGETS. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN TRACKING DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCOPING PLAN KNOW THAT REACHING OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. IS A BIG CHALLENGE. IT WILL REQUIRE MORE AMBITIOUS ACTIONS THAN. EVER BEFORE. SO WHILE WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS HEARING IN THE POLICY PACKAGE AIR BE HAS PUT TOGETHER FOR THIS PLAN. HOUSEHOLD WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT ADDITIONAL ACTIONS RESPECTIVE OR POLICIES MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE OUR MISSION STAY ON TRACK. FOR EXAMPLE ON THE SAME DAY THAT WE HEARD THE SCOPE OF PLAN. AIR BE ALSO HEARD UPDATES FROM STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS ON THE PROPOSED. S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE TARGETS. DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORTS EVERYONE AGREED THAT MORE AMBITIOUS TARGETS FOR S. B. THREE SONY FIVE. ARE FEASIBLE AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER WE KNOW THATSHIFTING LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PARENT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF REACHING A TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. PART TODAY'S DISCUSSION COULD BE ABOUT WHETHER ADDITIONAL POLICY INTERVENTIONS MAY BE NECESSARY. TO HELP ENSURE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR STATE EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE COMES FROM THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONS THAT HELPED BY THE STATE IN AN ONGOING WAY. THERE BE HAS MADE STRIDES AND GREAT STRIDES WITH ADDITION OF TWO NEW MEMBERS OF FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND CONTINUED CONVENING. OF THE ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE BUT OTHER STATE AGENCIES LIKE THE STREET TO GO COUNCIL. LACTOSE PERSPECTIVE STEM. MIGHT BE TIME FOR US TO CONSIDER HOW WE BETTER INSTITUTIONALIZE DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES IN ALL AREAS OF GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A FULL PICTURE. OF WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT ISN'T WORKING IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WE CAN TAKE TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO SUPPORT. OUR STATE GOALS AGAIN I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE OUR COLLEAGUES THAT ARE HERE AND THOSE OF YOU WHO WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING. QUITE THEM CALL THE FIRST. PRESENTER MRS AYE PANICLES. AND OUT ROSS BROWN. IS IT IS. YEAH PERFECT POTS CARP OUR FIRST PANEL TO A COME UP TO THE TABLE. THANK YOU AND THANKS TO BOTH OF THE CHAIRS AND ALL THE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE. MY NAME IS MARY NICHOLS AND I AM THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT CARP HAS PRESENTED IN FRONT OF THESE COMMITTEES BUT I AM PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY. TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ONE NINETY SEVEN. TO DISCUSS THE STATE'S PROGRESS ON AIR QUALITY IN THE EMISSIONS TRANS. AND THE TWENTY THIRTY SCOPING PLAN AND I WANT TO SORT OF SKETCH OUT SOME OF THE CONTEXT THAT THIS IS ALL. ABOUT TAKING PLACE WHERE THEY HAD. FIRST OF ALL LOOKING OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A SERIES OF BILLS THAT ADDRESS EMISSIONS IN COMMUNITIES. SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND GREENHOUSE GASES AND THESE IN AND OF THEMSELVES EACH ONE OF THEM. ARE IS A LANDMARK PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS WORTH CELEBRATING. OUR WORK AT CAR. GOES BACK FIFTY YEARS IN FACT WE'RE CELEBRATING OUR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR. AND WE WERE CREATED WITH THE GOALS AND ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING HEALTHY AIR QUALITY. OVER THE YEARS ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES WERE ADDED WITH RESPECT TO EXPOSURE TO TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS AND MOST RECENTLY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES. EACH WITH A SORT OF SEPARATE SET OF. REQUIREMENTS THAT WENT ALONG WITH THEM BUT ACROSS THE BOARD OF WE HAVE TRIED AT CAR. AND HAVE IN MANY WAYS I THINK I HAVE BEEN OF A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OUT LEADER IN TERMS OF PROVIDING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO MEETING. AIR QUALITY RULES AND REGULATIONS. LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE'VE DONE FIRST OF ALL WITH RESPECT TO AIR QUALITY THE THING THAT MOST. BUT DIRECTLY AFFECTS HUMAN HEALTH. USEPA SETS HEALTH BASED STANDARDS AND IT'S REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO REVIEW THOSE STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE. SUFFICIENTLY HEALTH PROTECTIVE BASED ON THE LATEST SCIENCE AND WE PROVIDE INPUT TO THAT PROCESS. THIS IS LED TO A SERIES OF INCREASINGLY STRINGENT STANDARDS OVER TIME THAT REFLECT THE IMPROVED. UNDERSTANDING OF HOW AIR POLLUTION ATTACKS PUBLIC HEALTH. OXIDES OF NITROGEN. CALLED KNOCKS ARE THE KEY SMOG FORMING POLLUTANTS THAT WE ARE NOW WORKING TO CONTROL. AND IN YOUR HANDOUT YOU HAVE A CHART THAT SHOWS CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS IN REDUCING THE KNOCKS THAT LEADS TO FORMING HAVE SMOG. AND AS THE. EVIDENCE FROM OUR STATEWIDE AIR MEASUREMENTS THE CURRENTLY DROPS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT SHOWS KNOCKS EMISSIONS DECREASING NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. BASED ON REGULATIONS ADOPTED TODAY. THIS PROGRESS REFLECTS THE BENEFITS OF BOTH CARB AND EPA PROGRAMS FOR MOBILE SOURCES AS WELL AS THEIR DISTRICT PROGRAMS FOR STATIONARY SOURCES. BECAUSE MOBILE SOURCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHTY PERCENT OF KNOCKS EMISSIONS MORE STRINGENT ENGINE STANDARDS CLEANER FUELS AN INCENTIVE FUNDING HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THIS PROGRESS. FOR EXAMPLE EMISSIONS FROM A NEW CAR THAT COULD BE OFFERED FOR SALE TODAY ARE NINETEEN NINE PERCENT CLEANER. THAN A CAR FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES. THIS PROGRESS IS IN RESPONSE TO AIR POLLUTANT FUEL STANDARDS ADOPTED BY CAR AS WELL AS INNOVATION THAT HAS BEEN CATALYZED BY STRINGENT STANDARDS. THAT WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS AND IMPLEMENTED THROUGH RIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT. AS YOU KNOW THE STANDARD SET HEARING CALIFORNIA COPY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD SO PEOPLE WELL BEYOND OUR BORDERS BENEFIT FROM CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP ON CLEAN AIR. AND I THINK IT IS WORTH POINTING OUT HERE THAT THIS PROGRESS IN ABSOLUTE MEASURE BACKDROP OF GROWTH OF POPULATION GROWTH THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BY AND OF COURSE OF GROWTH OF OUR ECONOMY SO IN. RELATIVE TERMS IT'S AN EVEN MORE AYE SERIOUS A TASK THAT WE ACCOMPLISH THEN MIGHT SEEM I JUST ON THE FACE OF IT. CARBON THE DISTRICTS OF ALSO WORK TO REDUCE RISK FROM EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION THAT IS TOXIC THAT IS. CHEMICALS THAT HAVE AND IMMEDIATE. DIRECT EFFECT ON EITHER. PRODUCING OUR SHORT TERM. FACTS OR THAT ARE ACKERSON AGENTS AND THESE INDUSTRIAL SOURCES INCLUDE REFINERIES AS WELL AS SMALLER SOURCES LIKE GAS STATIONS AND MOBILE SOURCES OF WHICH THE LARGEST IS DIESEL HEAVY DIESEL ARE. PARTICULATE. CALIFORNIA'S AIR TOXIC PROGRAM BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WITH ADOPTION OF THE TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL ACT SO WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING. WITH TALKS SAYS SINCE THAT TIME THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED OVER TWO HUNDRED SUBSTANCES THAT ARE HAZARDOUS TO HUMAN HEALTH INCLUDING LEAD BENZENE TAL YOU IN AN ASBESTOS. WE'VE ALSO ADOPTED NUMEROUS REGULATIONS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND EXPOSURE TO THESE POLLUTANTS INCLUDING PHASING OUT THE USE OF CARCINOGENS FROM DRY CLEANERS BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND SUBSTANTIALLYLIMITING THE LEVELS OF BENZENE IN GASOLINE TODAY THE STATE'S EFFORTS INCLUDE FOCUSING ON REDUCING EMISSIONS OF DIESEL PARTICULATE. WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE KNOWN CANCER RISK RELATED TO TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT SO BY FAR THE LARGEST. THE LARGEST SHARE. IN YOUR HANDOUTS YOU ALSO HAVE A CHART THAT SHOWS PROGRESS IN REDUCING DIESEL PARTICULATE. DIESEL UP PARTICULATE EMISSIONS HAVE DECREASED APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PERCENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY IN RESPONSE TO A SERIES OF REGULATIONS VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AN INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAMS THAT CARD IS IMPLEMENTED. MOBILE SOURCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NINETY PERCENT OF TALKS OR TOXIC DIESEL SO MOBILE SOURCE PROGRAMS ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THAT HAS OCCURRED. AND OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS STATEWIDE EMISSIONS A SAY SEE AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH IMPACTS FROM AIR TOXICS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THESE R. STATEWIDE NUMBERS AND OBVIOUSLY. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE AND YOU I KNOW ARE GONNA WHAT WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE. BUT THE EXAMPLES THAT I GAVE FOR KNOX AND DIESEL ARE INDICATIVE OF THE TRANS ACROSS THE STATE FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF POLLUTANTS THAT ARE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE HANDOUTS THAT WE PROVIDED. IN GENERAL EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN TRENDING DOWN FOR CRITERIA POLLUTANTS TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS AND GREENHOUSE GASES DUE TO A WHOLE SERIES OF LOCAL AND STATE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. PLUS INCREASINGLY IN RECENT YEARS INCENTIVES AND OTHER KINDS OF INITIATIVES. OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED CLEAN AIR REGULATIONS AND PROGRAMS I HAD NEVER. COUNTED THEM UP BEFORE WE STARTED TO GET READY FOR THIS HEARING. THESE REGULATIONS RANGE FROM SETTING VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS FOR FEELS AS WELL AS REQUIRING DIFFERENT FORMULATIONS FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS. MEANWHILE WILD CARD HAS BEEN DOING ITS WORK BOUT WITH AT POLLUTANTS AYE THAT ARE EMITTED FROM MOBILE SOURCES AND FEELS. AIR DISTRICTS ARE HAVE HAD THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEALING WITH INDUSTRIAL SOURCES AND THEY HAVE MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO THIS PROGRESS AS WELL. INCLUDING USING CATALYTIC CONTROLS ON POWER PLANTS LOW KNOCKS BOILERS AT REFINERIES AS AND ELSEWHERE. AND CLEANER COMBUSTION FOR SPACE HEATING AS WELL. NOW. I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO BE PROUD OF IN THESE NUMBERS ENTRANCE THE AIR IS CLEANER STATEWIDE THIRTY THOUSAND. PREMATURE DEATHS ARE AVOIDED EVERY YEAR. AND ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CASES OF ASTHMA HAVE BEEN AVOIDED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY AS WELL. AND ALL THE WHILE OF COURSE CALIFORNIA HAS CONTINUED TO BE THE SIX OR SOMETIMES THE FIFTH OR FOURTH. LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. BUT TO BE CLEAR THERE IS MUCH WORK AHEAD OF US. APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S THIRTY EIGHT MILLION RESIDENTS STILL LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT EXCEED THE FEDERAL HEALTH STANDARDS. EXPOSURE TO DIESEL PARTICULATE IS TOO HIGH. ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LOCATED NEAR FREIGHT FACILITIES SUCH AS PORTS RAILYARDS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. IN RESPONSE TO AB ONE NINETY SEVENS DIRECTION TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AM PUBLIC ACCESS TWO EMISSIONS AND INVENTORY DATA. CARB DEVELOPED THE POLLUTION MAPPING TOOL. THIS MAPPING TOOL ALLOWS USERS TO IDENTIFY AND COMPARE THE GREENHOUSE GAS CRITERIA POLLUTANT AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT EMISSIONS OF FACILITIES THAT REPORT USING OUR MANDATORY GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING PROGRAM. USING THIS TOOL A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAN ZOOM IN AND EXAMINE EMISSIONS WITH IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. WE HAVE A VIDEO DEMONSTRATION THAT KIDNAPPED THAT WE WANT TO SHOW YOU. IN JUST A MINUTE AYE I HOPE YOU'LL FIND IT INTERESTING BUT BEFORE WE SHOW THE VIDEO. I WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND. THE EMISSIONS DATA THAT'S USED IN THIS TO ALL WAS EXPANDED IN RESPONSE TO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AND CONTAINS AN ESTIMATE OF ANNUAL EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AS WELL AS CRITERIA. AND TOXIC EMISSIONS ON A FACILITY BASIS FOR THE LARGEST FACILITIES IN THE STATE. THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DATA ARE COLLECTED BY THE LOCAL I'M SORRY I COLLECTED THROUGH CART WAS MANDATORY REPORTING PROGRAM. THE CRITERIA. EXCUSE ME THE CRITERIA AND TOXIC AIR EMISSIONS DATA ARE COLLECTED BY THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. IT'S USEFUL DATA BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME WEAKNESSES FOR EXAMPLE DISTRICTS USE VARYING METHODOLOGIES AND DATA COLLECTION PRACTICES FOR REPORTING CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND AIR TOXIC EMISSIONS. SOMETIMES EVEN FROM THE SAME SOURCES. WE'RE WORKING ON HARMONIZING REPORTING METHODS AS PART OF THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN PROCESS BUT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THAT SOME FACILITIES MAY REPORT CRITERIA POLLUTANTS EVERY THREE YEARS BECAUSE OF LOCAL AIR DISTRICT REPORTING THRESHOLDS. AND AIR TOXIC EMISSIONS ONLY EVERY FOUR YEARS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT HOTSPOTS PROGRAM SO THERE'S AN UNEVENNESS IN THE DATA. IT'S NOT ALL EQUALLY TIMELY AND AS I SAID THIS I'VE SOMETIMES COLLECTED IN USING DIFFERENT CRITERIA. BUT NEVERTHELESS WE THINK THIS TOOL WILL ELP OUT FOR ONE THING BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL CREATE A DEMAND FOR MORE DATA AND MORE TIMELY DATA. AND IT WILL HELP COMMUNITIES TO TRACK TRENDS FROM FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE SAY AND COMPARE UP BY REGION AND BY FACILITY. SO THE FIRST YEAR WE STARTED COLLECTING GREENHOUSE GAS DATABUS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. SINCE THEN SOME FACILITIES HAVE SEEN EMISSIONS INCREASES AS CALIFORNIA GREW OUT OF ITS RECESSION. WHILE OTHERS HAVE A SCENE. DECREASES. AND. THIS IS INTERESTING TO LOOK AT IN OF ITSELF. BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT EMISSIONS VERY FROM YEAR TO YEAR FOR INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES WHICH IS NOT SURPRISING CONSIDERING THAT THERE ARE MANY ECONOMIC TECHNICAL AND REGULATORY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE OF FACILITIES EMISSIONS. NOTE THAT EMISSIONS FROM STATIONARY FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITS THAT ARE ENFORCED BY LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. WE EXPECT THAT ONE OF THE USES OF THIS TOOL IS GOING TO HELP INFORM COMMUNITY EFFORTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND EMISSIONS FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES THAT MAY BE IMPACTING A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. AND TO HELP PRIORITIZE WHERE MORE ACTION IS NEEDED. ENHANCED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER AB SIX AT SIX SEVENTEEN AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY ACTION PLANS. WILL HELP PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY REGARDING WHAT EACH FACILITY IS DOING AND HELP DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED. SO WE HAVE THIS BRIEF VIDEO DEMONSTRATION WHICH IF THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS WILL SHOW OFF SOME OF THE. SOME OF THE SEARCH FEATURES THAT THIS TOOL HAS TO OFFER. AND MY ASSISTANT. WILL THAT OUTLOOK BUT. PLAY THE VIDEO CARBON. AN INTERACTIVE WEB BASED MAPPING TOOL THAT DISPLAYS THE LOCATIONS OF LARGE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE GREENHOUSE GAS CRITERIA AND TOXIC POLLUTANT COMMISSIONS. THIS ONLINE TOOL ALLOWS USERS TO FIND AIR POLLUTION SOURCES IN THEIR COMMUNITY QUANTIFY THEIR EMISSIONS AND CHART THE EMISSION TRENDS OVER TIME. LET'S START BY TAKING A LOOK AT THE MAIN USER INTERFACE WHICH CONSISTS OF THREE PANELS. BUT CONTROL PANEL BUT DISPLAY PANEL. AT FACILITY LIST PANEL. THE CONTROL PANEL ALLOWS USERS TO SEARCH FACILITIES BY FACILITY NAME STREET ADDRESS GEOGRAPHIC REGION LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT. OR ANY OF MANY OTHER ATTRIBUTES. IT ALSO LETS USERS SELECT THE POLLUTANTS AND THE YEARS FOR WHICH DATA WILL BE DISPLAYED. THE DISPLAY PANEL SHOWS THE LOCATIONS OF THE FACILITIES ON A MAP AND USERS ARE ABLE TO PAN AND ZOOM THE MAP. FACILITIES ARE COLOR CODED BASED ON THEIR PRIMARY SECTOR. THE RIGHT SIDE BAR DISPLAYS A LIST OF FACILITIES ALONG WITH THEIR EMISSIONS THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE FILTER SELECTED IN THE SEARCH MENU. NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE INFORMATION THE TOOL CAN PROVIDE. USING THE TOOL SEARCH FEATURE WILL WORK FOR THE PHILLIPS SIXTY SIX REFINERY IN WILMINGTON. BUT NOTICE THAT THE LISTA FACILITIES HAS SHORTENED TO INCLUDE ONLY THOSE WITH PHILLIPS SIXTY SIX IN THEIR NAME. CLICKING ON THE FACILITY NAME IN THIS LIST SHOWS THE FACILITIES LOCATION ON THE MAP. AND OPENS IT INFORMATION WINDOW. THIS WINDOW CAN ALSO BE OPEN BY CLICKING DIRECTLY ON ANY FACILITY MARKER ON THE MAP. NOTICE THAT THE WINDOW HAS SIX TABS. THE FIRST TAB SHOWS BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE FACILITY. THE EMISSIONS TAB SHOWS A TABLE OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS CRITERIA AND TOXIC POLLUTANT MISSIONS REPORTED IN THE MOST CURRENT INVENTORY YEAR. THE GHG TREND AND CRITERIA TRjN TABS SO THE TREND OF THE FACILITIES EMISSIONS OVER TIME ALONG WITH THE TABLE AND EMISSIONS REPORTED FOR EACH YEAR. THE TOXIC STAB PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF EMISSIONS FOR EIGHT POLLUTANTS THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF SUBSTANCES COMMONLY EMITTED AND HIGHER VOLUMES OR THOSE WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT HEALTH IMPACTS. LASTLY THE COMPARE TAB ALLOWS USERS TO PLUG GREENHOUSE GAS CRITERIA AND TOXIC POLLUTANT TRENDS ON THE SAME CHART. NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT TWO VERY USEFUL FEATURES OF THE TOOL. FIRST GALLON VIRUS CREAM MAP PLAYERS ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP USERS LOCATE FACILITIES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA'S DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. USERS CAN CHOOSE TO DISPLAY ALL CENSUS TRACT IN THE STATE. ARE ONLY THOSE AND CALLIN VIRUS SCREENS TOP TWENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE. ON THIS MAP LAYER DARK RED INDICATES A COMMUNITY THAT IS HEAVILY IMPACTED BY POLLUTION POOR POOR SOCIAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WHILE DARK GREEN INDICATES A COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY THESE FACTORS. NEXT THE SHAPE OPTIONS IN THE TOUR ALLOW USERS TO SELECT SEVERAL FACILITIES AT ONCE USE IN A CIRCLE A RECTANGLE OR A POLY GONE. A PERSON LIVING IN A COMMUNITY CAN USE THIS FEATURE TO ASSESS THE CUMULATIVE EMISSIONS FROM FACILITIES NEAR THEM. HE IS IN THE RECTANGLE TOOL USERS CONTRIVED PERIMETER AROUND A CENSUS TRACT OR OTHER AREA OF INTEREST. WHEN USERS CLICK IN THE SHADED AREA THE TOOL OPENS A POPUP WINDOW DISPLAYING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE AREA AND THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES AND IT. OTHER TABS DISPLAY A LIST OF THE FACILITIES IN THE SELECTED AREA. THERE AGGREGATED EMISSIONS THE G. H. G.. CRITERIA. PENTOXIDE POLLUTANT COMMISSION TRANS. AND A CHART THAT ALLOWS TRjN COMPARISONS ACROSS PROGRAMS. THIS CONCLUDES OUR BRIEF DEMONSTRATION OF THE POLLUTION MAPPING TOOL. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO MEET OUR AB ONE NINETY SEVEN REQUIREMENTS PLEBE PLAN TO ANNUALLY UPDATE THE TOOL BUT THE MOST RECENT EMISSIONS DATA EACH SPRING. THAT'S IT. I WISH IT WERE LARGER BUT. AT A COMPUTER SCREEN IS PRETTY EASY TO. TO FOLLOW THE DAY THAT IT WASN'T REALLY DESIGNED I GUESS FOR THE FOR THE LARGE SCREEN BUT AB IT IS EASY TO ACCESS AND. HOPEFULLY YOU'LL HAVE AN OCCASION TO DO THAT AT SOME POINT. JERRY. YES THIS IS ONLY THE SOURCES THAT ARE UNDER. GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SALAD STATION IN THE LARGEST THE LARGEST FACILITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE TO REPORT THEIR GHGS WE'VE NOW LAYERED INTO THAT THEIR TOXICS AND THEY'RE ON CONVENTIONAL AIR POLLUTION EMISSIONS. UP IT WOULD BE. USEFUL AND INTERESTING TO DO SOMETHING THAT PUT IN ROADWAYS OR COMMUNITIES THOSE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL LAYERS AND A SORT OF BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE STARTED TO DO IN THE BEGINNING BUT CLEARLY THAT GEOGRAPHY OF THAT IS ALSO. IS ALSO VERY INTERESTING. SO I'M. AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE THE. AB SIX SEVENTEEN NOW REALLY. EXPANDS OUR. A ARBY'S. INTERACTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IS CERTAINLY HAS BEEN THE FIRST AND MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATION ADDRESSING CRITERIA POLLUTANT AND TOXIC EMISSIONS SINCE THE DAYS OF AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHT. EIGHTY EIGHT IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. THIS LEGISLATION FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING ISSUES IN OUR MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. IT ALSO REQUIRES CARP TO DEVELOP A STATE STRATEGY THAT OUTLINES MEASURES TO FURTHER REDUCE CRITERIA POLLUTANT AND AIR TOXICS EMISSIONS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. DEVELOP COMMUNITY MONITORING GUIDANCE AND REQUIRE ENHANCED EMISSIONS REPORTING FROM STATIONARY SOURCES. THE BILL RECOGNIZES THAT WHILE THE STATE HAS SEEN TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT AT THE REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE LEVEL THERE ARE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. THAT ARE REMAINING DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY POOR AIR QUALITY AND THAT IT IS THESE COMMUNITIES THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION AND ACTION. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IMPROVING THE INVENTORY IS GONNA BE A KEY COMPONENT OF ANY NEW STRATEGIES THAT WE WILL BE. THAT WILL BE DEVELOPING. SO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AND AB SIX SEVENTEEN REALLY WORK HAND IN HAND TO SUPPORT A FOCUSED EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS APPROACH. TO THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. NOW TURNING TO THE SCOPING PLAN THAT WE ADOPTED AT OUR LAST BOARD MEETING. WE HAVE BEEN. ALSO HARD AT WORK IN DEVELOPING AND UPDATING AND IMPLEMENTING. THE CLIMATE CHANGE SCOPING PLAN THIS PLAN WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS AND RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE. LEGISLATIVE INPUT OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND WEST UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED AT OUR DECEMBER BOARD HEARING. STAKEHOLDER SUPPORT FOR ITS APPROVAL WAS OVERWHELMING. THIS IS THE STATE'S THIRD SCOPING PLAN AND WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SINCE THE FIRST PLAN WAS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. BUT AGAIN WE'VE ALSO ADOPTED MORE STRINGENT AND. AMBITIOUS GOALS AND. HAVE A LOT MORE WORK AHEAD OF US. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN CONTINUES THE APPROACH OF USING A MIX OF REGULATIONS INCENTIVES AND MARKET BASED MECHANISMS. AS THE WHICH SUCH AS THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE R. S. B. THIRTY TWO. GOALS. USING A COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF STRATEGIES AS DESCRIBED IN THE SCOPING CLAN. WE'RE BUILDING ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE PAST TEN YEARS. BUT THE SCOPING PLAN ALSO PROVIDES. CERTAINTY. AS MUCH AS CERTAINTY IS AVAILABLE CONSIDERING THE VARIATIONS IN. GLOBAL EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES AND OTHER TRANS. INCLUDING THE ECONOMY. IT ALSO DELIVERS A NUMBER OF C! BENEFITS AND RESULTS IN A PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE TEST OF BEING COST EFFECTIVE. AND OF ATTRACTING UP PARTNERS ACROSS THE GLOBE WHICH WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL OBJECTIVES OF AB THIRTY TWO. AND WHICH WE BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT BOTH BECAUSE. GLOBAL WARMING IS BY DEFINITION A GLOBAL PROBLEM BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE WILL BENEFIT IN CALIFORNIA BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY AND ECONOMICALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR MEASURES. ARE COPIED BY OTHERS. SO IN ADDITION TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SEVERAL STRATEGIES IN THE SCOPING PLAN WERE DEVELOPED AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO MEET FEDERAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. AND REDUCE TOXICS AS WELL SO THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD AYE DELIVERING CLEANER FUELS AND ENERGY THE ADVANCE CLEAN CARS PROGRAM. WHICH IS PUT MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION CLEAN VEHICLES ON THE ROAD AND THE STATE OF AFRAID ACTION PLAN WILL RESULT IN EFFICIENT AND CLEANER SYSTEMS TO MOVE GOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS PART OF A PACKAGE WITH OTHER REDUCTION MEASURES. IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO MEET OUR S. B. THIRTY TWO GOALS WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF CERTAINTY AND LOWEST COST AVAILABLE. IT ALSO PROVIDES FURTHER BENEFITS INCLUDING ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF THE AT DIRECT INVESTMENTS OF CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSCORES CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE. CAP AND TRADE PROVIDES AND EFFICIENT AND SUSTAIN MARKET SIGNAL TO INVEST IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROMOTING A SHIFT TO CLEANER FORMS OF ENERGY THROUGHOUT OUR ECONOMY. INDEED OUR MODELING SHOWS THAT THE COST OF OTHER REGULATORY OPTIONS IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HIGHER TO ACHIEVE THE SAME TARGET FOR ANY GIVEN TARGET. SO WE THINK THAT ARE MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IS MORE EFFECTIVE WITH CAP AND TRADE THEM WITHOUT IT. AND WE'RE VERY GRATIFIED THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN US DIRECTION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROGRAM WITH SOME. ADDITIONAL ARE PROTECTIONS IN AT. WITH THE DECLINING EMISSIONS CAP THIS PROGRAM IS LEADING TO REEL IN THE STATE REDUCTIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AS WELL AS OTHER POLLUTANTS. THERE'S UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERN THAT NOT ALL FACILITIES ARE REDUCING EMISSIONS EQUALLY UNDER THE CAP. IN ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THIS ACTUALLY IS TRUE FOR ALL REGULATORY PROGRAMS NOT JUST CAP AND TRADE. FOR EXAMPLE AS PART OF OUR LONGSTANDING CRITERIA POLLUTANT PROGRAMS AIR DISTRICTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING RULES AND PERMITS TO LIMIT EMISSIONS FROM EQUIPMENT AT NEW AND EXISTING INDUSTRIAL SOURCES. EACH INDIVIDUAL AIR DISTRICTS PROGRAMS REFLECT THE NATURE AND SEVERITY OF THE AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES IN THEIR REGION AND LOCAL PREFERENCES ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE. CHALLENGES. DISTRICT RULES AND PERMITS ESTABLISH EMISSIONS LIMITS BUT THEY ALSO CONSIDER FEASIBILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS WHICH ACCOMMODATE DIFFERENCES AMONG INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES. BECAUSE OF THIS EMISSIONS MAY VARY FROM FACILITY TO FACILITY EVEN WHEN THEY ARE IN THE SAME BUSINESS AND SUBJECT TO THE SAME REGULATION. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY CAP AND TRADE WORKS TO ENSURE OVERALL COST EFFECTIVE REDUCTIONS BY ACCOMMODATING DIFFERENCES AMONG THE FACILITIES. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT TO ADDRESS EMISSIONS DISPARITIES WITHIN COMMUNITIES AND AMONG COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE REGULATORY SYSTEMS AS A WHOLE THE WHOLE SCOPING PLANT AND ITS ASSOCIATED STRATEGIES INCLUDING CAP AND TRADE. AND THE LOCAL RULEMAKING AND PERMITTING PROCESSES THAT ARE USED TO ADDRESS CRITERIA AND TOXICS EMISSIONS. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY HAS NEVER BEEN DONE ANYWHERE BEFORE. THAT IS WHY AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AND AB SIX SEVENTEEN ARE SO IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE A NEW FRAMEWORK THAT ALONG WITH EXISTING LAWS FOCUSES ON EMISSIONS DISPARITIES OF CRITERIA AND TOXIC POLLUTANTS THAT HAVE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES. YOUR HANDOUTS CHAU ARE ALSO SHOW A GRAPH OF THE INVENTORY TREND AND A GRAPH THAT SHOWS HOW CALIFORNIA'S REDUCED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. RELATIVE TO GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND PER CAPITA OVER TIME. TO PROVIDE A CONTEXT FOR THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOR STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS HAVE DECREASED BY FIFTY MILLION METRIC TONS CO TWO EQUIVALENT OR ABOUT TEN PERCENT. WHICH WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF REMOVING APPROXIMATELY TEN AND A HALF MILLION PASSENGER VEHICLES FROM THE ROSE. THAT'S THAT CURRENTLY THAT CURRENT EMISSIONS LEVELS THAT THE X. VEHICLES EXCUSING. YOU CAN SEE. HOW THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION IMPACTED EMISSIONS AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DECREASED? BUT AS OUR ECONOMY REBOUNDED AFTER THE RECESSION IT IT DID SO WITH A MUCH LOWER CARBON FOOTPRINT. SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY DECOUPLED GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY FROM GROWTH IN EMISSIONS OF CO TWO. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE THAT POINT BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ASSUMED THAT REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MUST ACCOMPANY REDUCE GHG. EMISSIONS OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS SHOWN THAT THAT IS FALSE. CALIFORNIA'S DEMONSTRATING TO THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN DECOUPLE GHG EMISSIONS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. LAST WE'RE ON TRACK TO MEET OUR AB THIRTY TWO GHG TARGETS OF NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS OF EMISSIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY. WE BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET STANDARD SOMEWHAT BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING. IT PUTS US ON A PATH FOR THE NEXT DECADE WHERE WE WILL NEED EVEN STEEPER REDUCTIONS. SO WHILE THIS NEW PLAN IS SET TO. ON A PATH TO ACHIEVE A TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO FINE TUNE THIS PLAN. ONE A YEAR AS AYE REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE AS REQUIRED ON OUR PROGRESS AND WE ALSO PROVIDE WRITTEN REPORTS ON OUR CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAMS. YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN A FORMAL WAY TO HEAR WHAT CHANGES WERE CONTEMPLATING AND TO GIVE US YOUR. VIEWS IN ADDITION TO OTHER WAYS IN WHICH. YOU OF COURSE HAVE INPUT TO OUR WORK AS WELL. R. BOARD RECEIVES ANNUAL BRIEFINGS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCOPING PLAN AND A B. THIRTY TWO REQUIRES US TO UPDATE THE PLAN EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO ACTIVE WORST CASE EVERY FIVE YEARS WE WOULD BE PRODUCING A NEW PLAN. THAT UPDATES BASED ON NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND AN ASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE ARE. AS WITH ALL OF OUR PLANS AND REGULATIONS WILL BE MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION AND CONTINUING TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL. AS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO ADJUST COURSE OR MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AS NEEDED. THERE'S A HANDOUT ALSO THAT LISTS ALL OF THE REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ENGAGE ON THE CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND I THINK IT'S. AYE MAY BE HELPFUL TO JUST SEE THAT ARRAY OF. DIFFERENT INTERACTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT AB THREE NINETY EIGHT PROVIDED SPECIFIC LEGISLATION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM INCLUDING THE CAPS ADDING USE OF OFFSETS PRICE CONTAINMENT POINTS. AND THE PRICE CEILING WE HAVE HEARD THE LEGISLATURE AND ALSO FOR MANY OTHERS WHO WANT TO WEIGH IN ON HOW WE SHOULD INCORPORATE THESE CHANGES INTO THE REGULATIONS. AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE ARE NOW IN THE MIDST OF A FULL PUBLIC PROCESS THAT WILL EVALUATE AND CONSIDER ALL THE SUGGESTIONS. I KNOW THAT THE LA I WAS SPEAKING AFTER ME AND WILL WANT TO DISCUSS SOME OF THESE AREAS IN MORE DETAIL. I JUST WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE HAVE NOT REACHED OUR FINAL CONCLUSIONS ON HOW ANY OF THIS WILL BE PUT FORWARD AND THAT WE ARE UP PAYING ATTENTION TO TO WHAT WE HEAR. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE'RE GONNA DO SHARE OUR PROPOSALS PUBLICLY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT ALL MARKET PARTICIPATES AND INTERESTED PARTIES. GET THE SAME INFORMATION AT THE SAME TIME AND I MAKE THIS UP POINT BECAUSE WE ARE IMPLEMENTING AS WE SPEAK A MARKET BASED PROGRAM WHERE THERE'S TRADING GOING ON. IN CALIFORNIA CARBON ALLOWANCES AND AS WITH ANY TYPE OF A MARKET TRADING PROGRAM AT INSIDER INFORMATION HAS VALUE AND CAN DISTORT THE PROGRAM AND SO WE'RE VERY VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE DO RELEASE INFORMATION. THAT WE RELEASED IT IN PUBLIC AT THE SAME TIME TO EVERYBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE AN INTEREST IN IT. SO LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT OUR CHALLENGES ARE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE WITH YOU DOES THAT ONE SECTOR REALLY STANDS OUT AS THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF EMISSIONS AND OUR STATE AND THAT IS THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. IT ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NINETY PERCENT OF DIESEL PARTICULATE AS I SAID BEFORE. LARGEST EMISSIONS SOURCES INCLUDING TRUCKS LOCOMOTIVES AND SHIPS WHICH ARE IN SOME CASES NOT SUBJECT TO DIRECT CONTROL BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL. CONTROL OUT BUT WE CAN'T MEET OUR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. OUR APPROACH IN THIS SECTOR INCLUDES NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND FINDING WAYS TO BRING THEM ON FUELS INCENTIVES INSISTING OF WILL LAND USE PLANNING. BUT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS ACTIVELY AT WORK DISMANTLING THE FEDERAL RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLEAN AIR. BETWEEN DISBANDING THE FEDERAL CLIMATE ADVISORY PANEL PREPARING TO RESCIND THE CLEAN POWER PLAN COURT ACTIONS ROLLING BACK FEDERAL LAWS AND SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS REDUCTION STRATEGIES. AND WITHDRAWING FROM THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT. EVERY MONTH BRINGS ANOTHER ROLLBACK AND INCREASINGLY ALARMING POLICIES THAT REALLY ARE THREATENED THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR CLIMATE. CALIFORNIA HAS CONTINUED AND I BELIEVE I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US WHEN I SAY THAT. I EXPECT THAT WE WILLCONTINUE TO AT LEAD THE WAY NOT ONLY BY PROVIDING AN EXAMPLE OF REDUCING EMISSIONS WHILE GROWING OUR ECONOMY. BUT ALSO AS A PLACE THAT DRIVES NEW pTECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS. STATE THAT LOOKS BEYOND OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND DECADES INTO THE FUTURE. HOWEVER FEDERAL ACTIONS OR LACK THEREOF MAY NOT ONLY IN PERIL LOT ACTIONS THAT ARE TAKEN IN OTHER STATES BUT ALSO MAY UNDERCUT OUR ABILITY AS A STATE. WE ARE UNIQUE IN THE COUNTRY AND BEING ABLE TO ADOPT MORE STRINGENT MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSIONS AS A STATE. BASED ON THE HISTORY OF OUR EARLY ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP AND OUR ON GOING AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO ADOPT NEW STANDARDS EVERY TIME WE LOOK AT A PROGRAM. WE HAVE TO SEEK A WAIVER FROM U. S. EPA. THIS PROCESS HAS GROWN TO INCLUDE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STANDARDS ALSO KNOWN AS THE PAVLEY REGULATIONS. AND OF COURSE WE'VE USED THIS PROCESS TO. ATTRACT OTHER STATES THAT WANT TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD WHICH THEY CONTINUE TO DO. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SEEK A PRODUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN IT COMES TO THE VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAY CHOOSE NOT TO APPROVE R. WAIVERS. TO PURSUE FUTURE STANDARDS OR EVEN ATTEMPT TO ATTACK OUR AUTHORITY ALTOGETHER. AND I I WANT TO END ON THIS NOTE OF ALARM BECAUSE. IF WE WERE TO LOSE THE ABILITY TO SET GREENHOUSE GAS STANDARDS FOR VEHICLES. WE WOULD CERTAINLY FIGHT. WE WOULD FIGHT IT WITH EVERY LEGAL TOOL THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO US AS WELL AS. ALL OTHER TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. BUT IF WE WERE TO LOSE WE WOULD REALLY LOSE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE. ALL OF THE VARIOUS. OBJECTIVES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS INCLUDING GREENHOUSE GASES AND CRITERIA AND TOXICS WOULD BE HUGELY IMPAIRED NOT TO MENTION THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT THIS WOULD HAVE ON THE HEALTH. OF NEARBY COMMUNITIES AND IF WE WERE TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO. TO ACHIEVE OUR OVERALL GOALS WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP THE REMAINING REDUCTIONS THROUGH ALTERNATIVE MEASURES THAT WOULD BE DIRECTED AT OTHER SECTORS AS AS NECESSARY SO. WITH THAT. I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY I'M SORRY THAT THIS HAS BEEN A LONG BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO LAY OUT THE. OVERALL AND SITUATION IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WERE AND ASKED IN ADVANCE AND I AM GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. THAT THANK YOU A COLLEAGUES UNLESS THERE'S A BURNING QUESTION THAT WE WANT TO ASK NOW IS IT OKAY IF. WE GO INTO THE NEXT PRESENTER. AND THEN OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS AND AND. COMMENTS. CONSENSUS IS OKAY YEP THEN WILL. YEAH SHE'S GOT SHE'S I THINK ISRAEL YEAH. ALRIGHT CLEARLY BECAUSE CAP AND TRADE AS OF REFERENCE GONNA PLAYS A KEY ROLE AND. TWENTY. THIRTY SCOPING PLAN THAT WAS RECENTLY ADOPTED BY CAR. AS SORT OF THE WAY TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE MEETS ITS GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS AND SO WE WANT TO KIND OF FOCUS ON SOME THE KEY IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS THAT COULD THAT COULD AFFECT. AND THE ABILITY OF THE PROGRAM TO HELP ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. I WILL JUST MAKE JUST THAT BEFORE I CAN GET INTO SOME OF THOSE KEY IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED AND OVERSIGHT ISSUES THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED. DO JUST WANT TO KIND OF. MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT ON JUST GENERAL KIND OF. AND ISSUES RELATED TO THE SCOPING PLAN. THE SCOPING PLAN INCLUDES A VARIETY OF POLICIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY DIRECTED AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT SUCH AS AN RP ASSN VARIOUS ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO A FAIR AMOUNT OF DISCRETION FOR CARP TO ADOPTS ADDITIONAL POLICIES THAT IT FEELS IT AND ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS AND POLICIES. WHILE THERE'S SOME. DIRECTION IN STATUTE. FOR A RB TO CONSIDER THINGS LIKE COST EFFECTIVENESS. TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY. PIMCO POLLUTANTS LEAKAGE IN A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS. ULTIMATELY THERE'D THAT COMES DOWN TO KIND OF. DELICATE BALANCE A BALANCE IN ALL THOSE DIFFERENT FACTORS AND SO I SINCE THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF DISCRETION GIVEN TO CAR WE THINK THESE TYPES OF OVERSIGHT HEARINGS TO. CHECK IN ON KIND OF HOW CARP HAS BALLOTS THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS AND PUTTING THE PLAN TOGETHER ARE PARTICULARLY. HELPFUL. AND ARE BE ONE KEY ISSUE TO. IN PARTICULAR TO KEEP AN EYE ON IS IS COST EFFECTIVENESS EFFECTIVENESS IN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A DIFFERENT POLICIES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE PLAN. THOSE COSTS ARE ARE ULTIMATELY BORNE BY. HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES. AND SO WE THINK SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE TO ASK IN THIS HEARING AND OTHERS IS. TO THE EXTENT OF POLICIES ADOPTED THAT IT'S ESTIMATED TO BE MORE COSTLY THEN ALTERNATIVE WHAT ARE THE REASONS FOR ADOPTING THAT POLICY WIRES. POTENTIALLY MORE COSTLY POLICY BEING ADOPTED ARE THERE MAY BE VERY GOOD REASONS FOR DOING THAT PERHAPS THERE'S NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF TECHNOLOGICAL PUSH OR THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF POLLUTANTS THAT ARE TRYING TO BE ADDRESSED FOR THAT POLICY BUT. TO TRY TO GET GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS MIGHT BE WORTH. WHATEVER ADDITIONAL BENEFITS MIGHT COME WITHOUT POLICY. THAT ALSO. PERHAPS ASKING THE QUESTION ARE THERE OTHER POLICY TOOLS ARE AVENUES THAT COULD BE USED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE OTHER. GOALS THAT ARE TRYING TO THAT SHOULDN'T TRYING TO BE ACHIEVED OUTSIDE OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND I THINK AB SIX SEVENTEEN IT'S GOT ANOTHER IS AN EXAMPLE OF. KIND OF AN APPROACH TO TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THROUGH SORT OF DIFFERENT A POLICY VENUE THAN THAN THE SCOPE AND. THE OTHER KEY ISSUE. WE WANNA HIGHLIGHT IS JUST KIND OF THE. THE QUESTIONS AROUND. THE RISK AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE PLAN AS OUTLINED. BY CAR BUT IS GOING TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. CAP AND TRADE IS REALLY SORT CENTRAL IN THE PLAN AS A BACKSTOP. TWO IF YOU KNOW OTHER POLICIES EITHER DON'T WORK OR JUST MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE AND THE ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED THAT OTHER POLICIES ARE. ACHIEVING THE CABIN TRADERS THERE. TO KIND OF HELP ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND HELP ME THE STATE TARGETS. AND I THINK THE KEY QUESTION THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO ASK IS IS A PROGRAM UP TO THAT SHOT IS A DESIGNED IN A WAY. THAT WILL ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND THIS GETS INTO SOME OF THE DETAILS AROUND KIND OF THE SPECIFIC DESIGN ELEMENTS AND STRUCTURE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THAT WE. DISCUSS IN OUR REPORT SO. I WANTED TO JUST TOUCH ON TWO OF THOSE ISSUES THERE'S WE TALK ABOUT A VARIETY OF ISSUES IN OUR REPORT BUT I WANNA TOUCH ON. TWO OF THEM IS AS IMPORTANT KIND OF QUESTIONS AND THINGS THAT THINK ABOUT AS FAR AS RISKS OF NOT MEETING THE. THE. THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AND ANYTHING ABOUT DESIGN FEATURES THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THE FIRST RELATES TO. BANKING AND SETTING THE POST TWENTY TWENTY CAPS SO THIS REAL QUICKLY BANKING AS THAT IS A DESIGN FEATURE IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHERE AN ALLOWANCE ISSUED TODAY. CAN BE USED TO. HELD OUT A PURCHASED IN HELD ONTO AND USED IN A FUTURE YOU'RE IN THE PROGRAM. AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF. SET UP AS SORT OF A WAY TO KIND OF. AND MITIGATE PRICE VOLATILITY BASICALLY WRITTEN OFF THERE'S AN EXPECTATION AS THE KAPPA COMES MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME PRICES IN LATER YEARS COULD BE QUITE A BIT HIGHER FOR ALLOWANCES THAN THEY ARE TODAY AND SO THAT. CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO. PURCHASED OR OBTAINED SOME ALLOWANCES NOW AND SO THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF KIND OF. SMOOTHING PRICES OVER TIME ESSENTIALLY CAN I THINK POTENTIALLY INCREASING PRICES IN THE NEAR TERM BUT LOWERING PRICES. IN THE OUT YEARS AND SO IT AND ALSO HAS OR HAS THE EFFECT OF MOVING. EMISSIONS AN EMISSION REDUCTIONS. FROM ONE TIME PERIOD TO THE OTHER TIME PERIOD. THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH AND I HAVE BEEN BANKING AS PART OF THE PROGRAM REDUCING PRICE VOLATILITY ENCOURAGING. EARLIER A MISSION REDUCTIONS IN THOSE ARE. WE THINK SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES TO HAVING THAT AS PART OF THE PROGRAM. OUT WE JUST WENT OUT HIGHLIGHT ONE TRADE OFF ASSOCIATED WITH DOING THAT BY BY HAVING. BANKING ALLOWED IN THE PROGRAM ESSENTIALLY CREATES A KIND OF CUMULATIVE CAP OVER MANY DIFFERENT YEARS OF THE PROGRAM SO IT'S NOT. AN ANNUAL CAP ON EMISSIONS. IT'S REALLY KIND OF SINCE YOU CAN MOVE THOSE ALLOW ALLOWANCES FROM EARLY YEARS TO LATER YEARS THAT THEY CAME OUT OF CAP ON EMISSIONS AND. THAT JUST CREATES A KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL TENSION BETWEEN. OF HAVING THAT ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM AND HAVING A TWENTY THIRTY ANNUAL TARGET IN PLACE AND SO WE JUST KIND OF WANNA. HIGHLIGHT THAT AS ONE IMPORTANT ISSUE TO TO THINK ABOUT WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE CERTAINTY ANY CERTAINTY THAT HAPPENED TRADE. PROVIDES IS GOING TO PROVIDE SECULAR ADMONITION CERTAINTY BUT NOT NECESSARILY AS MUCH. ANNUAL EMISSIONS CERTAINTY. BECAUSE YOU CAN USE SOME BANK ALLOWANCES FROM EARLIER YEARS AND LATER YEARS. THE ISSUE IS THAT COULD BE PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT F. THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT CAN BE BANKS FROM EARLIER YEARS AND USED IN LATER YEARS. AND YOU YOU COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A SITUATION WHERE IN THE LATER YEARS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF BANK ALLOWANCES ARE USED YOU'RE SICK YOU ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT YOUR ACTUAL TWENTY THIRTY ANNUAL TARGET DOES. I I'D LIKE TO POINT YOU TO A PAGE AIDS OF OUR REPORT IN FIGURE THREE. AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY OUR ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATION OF JUST SOME OF THE ISSUES I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. JUST TOOK A WALK YOU THROUGH FIGURE THREE ON PAGE EIGHT. YOU SEE THE THE TOP AND A LIGHT PURPLE LINE THERE IS REALLY. WHAT THE ANNUAL CAPS ARE THE NOT BASICALLY THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ISSUED IN THE PROGRAM AND YOU'LL SEE THAT KIND OF? RELATIVELY STEEP DECLINE IN THE ANNUAL CAPS FROM. TWENTY FIFTEEN DOWN TO TWENTY THIRTY REACHING THAT THE TWENTY THIRTY ANNUAL TARGET. NOW THAT THE REDLINE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT BELOW THAT IN THIS LITTLE LESS DEEP THAN THAT PURPLE LINE. IS KIND OF THOSE FIRST COUPLE YEARS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN IS WHERE EMISSIONS OF ACTUALLY. BAN SO YOU CAN SEE AN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN BELOW WHERE THOSE ANNUAL CAPS HAVE BEEN. AND THIS EXAMPLE IN THIS CHART WE JUST PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE SCENARIO WHERE EMISSIONS CONTINUE TO DECLINE BUT I. YOU KNOW AT A RELATIVELY STEADY RATE AND NOT AS STEEP AS THAT THE COPS ACTUAL ACTUALLY DECLINE AND SO IN THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO YOU COULD. RESULTS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF BANKS ALLOWANCES FROM SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT THE PURPLE LINE AND THAT THE RED LINE. THOSE ARE KIND OF HELD ONTO NOT USED IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS OF THE PROGRAM AND THEN USE TO COMPLY AND THE LATER YEARS OF THE PROGRAM. AND SO IF YOU YOU SORT OF SEE THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE CHART THERE AS HE REACHED THE LATER YEARS OF THE PROGRAM OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY. YOU GET OUT A SCENARIO WHERE THE ACTUAL EMISSIONS ALTHOUGH THE CAPS ARE SET LOWER AND I CAN SET TO REACH THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. ACTUAL EMISSIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT AND SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF EXAMPLES THIS IS THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE THAT COULD BE MANY POTENTIAL. FUTURE SCENARIOS BUT THE TYPE OF EXAMPLE WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND CARVE SHOULD BE. THINKING ABOUT AND THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH CERTAINTY DOES NOT A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED PROVIDED MEDIAN THE THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. I EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT DOES PROVIDE DIRECTION TO CARB TO. TO ANALYZE THIS ISSUE AND SO WE THINK. TO GO IMPORTANT FILED FOR THE LEGISLATURE CAN TO TO CONTINUE TO ASK. HOW CARBS ANALYZING THIS ISSUE WHAT CRITERIA THAT'S GOING TO USE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OUT OF THINKS IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND IF SO IF IT IS DETERMINED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE? WHAT TYPES OF RESPONSES THE STATE MIGHT TAKE TO ADDRESS THIS POTENTIAL RISK IN NOT MEETING THE THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS ARM? AND OUR OUR REPORT WE HIGHLIGHT ONE POTENTIAL OPTION. IF THIS IS DETERMINED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF NOT MEETING OUR OUR OF THE LONG TERM TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW ADJUSTING POST TWENTY TWENTY CAPS TO ANNE OF DOWNWARD ESSENTIALLY. REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES SOLD AT REGULAR OPTIONS GOING FORWARD A TO KINDA HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THERE'S A. IF THERE IS AN ISSUE THERE'S A A RISK ERA TRADE OFF I GUESS ASSOCIATE WITH DOING THAT BY REDUCING THE SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES THAT PUTS UPWARD PRESSURE ON. PRICES AND COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM. AND THAT SAID YOU WERE OUT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OTHER AYE DESIGN FEATURES IN THE CABIN FOR A PROGRAM LIKE A HARD PRICE CEILING LIKE VARIOUS PRICE CONTAINMENT POINTS THAT ARE. SPECIFICALLY SET OUT TO TRY AND MITIGATE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT. HIGH PRICES IN AND PRICE INCREASES AND SO I WOULD THINK THAT THE STATE IN THE LEGISLATION OUT OF THINK ABOUT RELYING ON THOSE ARE SORT OF THE THE TOOL TO MITIGATE AGAINST POTENTIAL. PRICE INCREASES. NOW THE SECOND FEATURE I'LL JUST TOUCH ON VERY BRIEFLY. AND AS WAS REFERENCED IN THE OPENING COMMENTS R. EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT ALSO DIRECTED CARB TO ESTABLISH A HARD PRICE CEILING. AND. ESSENTIALLY AN EFFORT TO HELP. LIMIT POTENTIAL HIGH COSTS AND HIGHER ALLOWANCE PRICES IN THE PROGRAM. THIS IS IMPLEMENTED. ESSENTIALLY BY. ONCE PRICES REACHED THAT THE LEVEL OF THAT HARD PRICE CEILING THEN CARVE WILL. ISSUE OR SAU ALLOWANCES AT THAT PRICE ESSENTIALLY AN UNLIMITED NUMBER ALLOWANCES AT THAT PRICE SO WHILE THIS DESIGN FEATURE DOES HAVE THE BENEFIT OF CONTAINING COSTS THERE. CLEAR TRADE OFF IS THAT IF PRICES REACHED THAT LEVEL THEN THERE'S NO LONGER THE SAME TYPE OF CAP ON EMISSIONS AND. AND CAR WILL. WILL ISSUE COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS UNLIMITED EMERALD COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS AT THAT PARTICULAR PRICE. THAT THE LEGISLATION GIVES CAR SO THIS IS THE AYE AYE ANOTHER AREA OF KIND OF RISK UNCERTAINTY AROUND SEE OF THE STATE. THE CAPTAIN OF ENSURING THAT THE STATE NEEDS ITS CLIMATE GOALS AND ARGUED THAT IT'S A REASONABLE. POLICY. A DESIGN FEATURE BUT IT IT IS IT IS A RISK. THE LEGISLATION AB THREE NINETY EIGHT GETS CAR BUT. SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION IN DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THIS PRICE CEILING SO HAVE HOW TO BALANCE THAT COST CONTAINMENT FEATURE AND. THE POTENTIAL OF OF ISSUING MORE ALLOWANCES AND POTENTIALLY EXCEEDING WHAT THE THE OVERALL CAPPERS. SO THAT'S AGAIN A VERY. AND ARGUE IMPORTANT AREA FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE OVERSIGHT ON. WHAT THEIR CAR BAND ITS PROPOSED PRICE CEILING? BALANCES THESE CONCERNS AROUND COSTS AS WELL AS EMISSIONS CERTAINTY IN A WAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE. AGREES WITH THINGS CONSISTENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES. FINALLY I I JUST TOUCH VERY QUICKLY ON JUST ONE OTHER ISSUE WE RAISED IN THE REPORT AND THAT RELATES TO JUST ONGOING OVERSIGHT. STATE KIND OF POLICIES AND CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I AB THREE NINETY EIGHT CREATED. A NEW INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEES TO HELP ASSESS AND LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AND ADVISE ON ON DIFFERENT POLICIES. THAT. COMMITTEE IS TASKED WITH EVALUATING THE FIREMEN ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF CAP AND TRADE AND OTHER RELATED CLIMATE POLICIES. AND AS THE TO CONSIST OF EXPERTS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM OUR OFFICE. AND ARMY WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP IN TO PROVIDE A LOT OF VALUE IN HELPING THE LEGISLATURE I GET BETTER INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTS OF ITS KIND OF POLICIES. THAT HAVE NO ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE GONNA HELP IN. WITH LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT EFFORTS. WE ALSO BUT WE DO WANT TO POINT OUT SOME POTENTIAL AREAS WERE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT CLARIFYING OR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DIRECTION ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE. ONE EXAMPLE IS JUST THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE COMMITTEE. THE A LEGISLATION REFERENCES CAP AND TRADE AND OTHER RELATED CLIMATE POLICIES AND SO. IF THE COMMITTEE IS TASKED WITH EVALUATING ALL THE DIFFERENT CLIMATE POLICIES THAT THE STATE HAS AYE THAT COULD EITHER REQUIRE A LOT OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. OR. PERHAPS LIMIT SORT OF THE THEIR ABILITY TO KIND OF DIG DEEPLY INTO ONE PARTICULAR KIND OF POLICY LIKE CAP AND TRADE. THE OTHER ISSUE IS JUST ADD MORE ABOUT THE KIND OF THE ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE AND WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION THE LEGISLATURE WANTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IT'S CALL ITS NAME AND ADVISORY COMMITTEE BUT THE STATUTE RELEASE ARE DIRECTED TO EVALUATE THE. THE AFFECTS OF PROGRAMS AND SO IN SOME WAYS AND A VAST SERVING AS AN ADVISORY ROLE IS THAT OFTENTIMES VERY DIFFERENT FROM OF VALUE IT IN PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM AND ANALYZING AND EVALUATING PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM AND SO. OF THE LEGISLATURE. MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT. THAT CLEAR FINE YOU KNOW WHICH OF THOSE EXACTLY. WHICH ROLE IT WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERTAKE I KNOW CARBON AT AN INITIAL WORKSHOP HAS INDICATED THAT. IT VIEWS AS YOU THE COMMITTEE AS HAVING A ROLE IN EVALUATING PASSED PROGRAM PERFORMANCE BUT NOT NECESSARILY ADVISING ON THE FUTURE DESIGN. A OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM RATHER CLIMATE POLICIES AND SO ON THE LEGISLATURE WILL I THINK WHEN I LOOK AT AT WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT ITS INTENT WAS. AND ARE MOVING FORWARD WHETHER ONCE THIS COMMITTEE TO PERFORM THAT FUNCTION OR OR OR BOTH FUNCTIONS OR DEMOCRATS STRAIGHT AT ANOTHER COMMITTEE FOR. FOR THE. TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT THAT IT MIGHT WANT. SO I WILL. LEAD MY A KIND OF IN MY COMMENTS THERE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I'M STILL CYNICAL FAMOUS R. BROWN. WE HAVE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR. GUEST. MR STERN. JUMPING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CHAIR FOR CONVENING TODAY IN CHAIR NICHOLS AND ROSS FOR COMING BY ADN YOU'RE WELCOME BACK. I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THREE QUICK AREAS AND JUST GET YOUR GUYS FEEDBACK ON A. IN LIGHT OF THE WILDFIRES WE'VE BEEN HAVING. STATEWIDE. ANOTHER SORT OF UNANTICIPATED LARGE SCALE EMISSIONS EVENTS LIKE THE PORTER RANCH GHASTLY. THREADED ONE END IT GET A SENSE FROM YOU ALL AS TO THE. THE INVENTORY ITSELF UNDERLYING ALL OUR NUMBERS AND HOW. HOW WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT SHIFTING IN FUTURE YEARS HOW WE CURRENTLY CAPTURE THOSE SORT OF UNANTICIPATED EMISSIONS AND HOW THAT? COULD AFFECT OUR PROGRAMS GOING FOR IT SO TOUCH ON THAT ONE. THIS THIS QUESTION OF OVERSUPPLY ALLOWANCES AND ALL THE. THE ALLOWANCES WE'VE GOT. SORT OF BANKS IT IN THE PUBLIC TRUST RIGHT NOW HELD BY THE AIRPORT. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW BEST TO HANDLE THOSE. FOR MITIGATING PRICE VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT. THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EXPOSED TO THIS POLLUTION MOST OF ALL HAVE SOME INSURANCE HAVE OF JUSTICE IN THAT. THEY'RE NOT JUST GONNA BE EVERYTHING SORT OF LET OUT THE SYSTEM IN A BUDGET CHEAP ALLOWANCES FLOODING THE MARKET NEVER THE AWARENESS OR TO CREATE A PRICE I SORT OF WANTED TO HEAR. STRATEGIES THAT ARE BEING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT HOW YOU ALL MIGHT THINK OF ADDRESSING. THAT AND THEN THE LAST PIECE. WAS ABOUT. I APPRECIATE THE DIGGING IN ON CAP AND TRADE ITSELF AND THAT SORT OF IN THE CENTERPIECE ALSO THE SCOPING PLAN BUT. IT'S MY OPINION THAT IT IS NOT THE GUARANTOR OF. NOT ONLY ARE OUR CLIMATE TARGET ULTIMATELY WE CAN GET THERE ON CAP AND TRADE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT WAY FOR THE STATE TO RELY SOLELY ON THAT I KNOW WE HAVE GOT ALL THOSE OTHER COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES IN. IN OUR PORTFOLIO RIGHT NOW BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT TOOLS GETTING TAKEN OFF THE TABLE SO IF WE HAVE TO FIGHT THE CLIMATE CHANGE FIGHT WITH ONE HAND TIED BEHIND OUR BACK. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LET'S TAKE THAT. MOBILE SOURCE TO AWAY FROM US YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER OPTIONS DO WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL AND REALLY TO TRY TO GET. A REAL SENSE FROM YOU WE'RE DEALING WITH INDUSTRY HERE AT A STATE LEVEL. AND I FEEL RIGHT NOW LIKE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. IS OFFERING INDUSTRY SAY YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SORT OF ON A GOOD SOLID DIE FOR HOWEVER LONG NOW CERTAINLY CHANGE YOUR SEEING AUTO YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T JUST. PICKED UP A FORD C. MAX. ONE NINETY NINE A MONTH LEAST YOU GET A YOU GET YOUR STICKER YOU GET YOUR REBATE IT'S LIKE THAT'S THAT'S A CAR A MIDDLE CLASS FEELINGS ARE TO GET INTO. THEIR EVEN BETTER YOU FEES ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW THINGS ARE STARTED CHANGING THE AUTO INDUSTRY. AND IT SEEMED LIKE THE PRESIDENT'S LISTENING TO THE AUTO INDUSTRY BECAUSE HE SAVED A PIECE OF THE TAX CREDIT. AFTER SOME CEO CALL SO OBVIOUS IS LISTENING ARE THEY TELLING WASHINGTON A DIFFERENT STORY THAN THEY'RE TELLING US. THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE. YOU KNOW OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN OFFER THEM. THE BACON DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER AFTER TEN YEARS OF STARTING TO LIKE CUT SOME OF THAT OUT OF OUR DIET AND START TO TIGHTEN OUR BELTS A BIT. MORE DISK INTO BACKSLIDE WE ARE PROBLEMS SO JUST. BUT THAT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE BUT THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS. WELL NOT EXPENSIVE AT ALL YEAH. LEGISLATION AYE I'LL TRY TO ANSWER ALL THREE QUESTIONS AND I'LL DO IT THEM FAIRLY BRIEFLY SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS THAT. I THINK DIRECTED TO THE ISSUE OF WHAT'S IN THE INVENTORY AND IN PARTICULAR. THE. PROBLEM WHICH WE'VE CERTAINLY FACED VERY DRAMATICALLY THIS YEAR THAT AB FIRES CAN RELEASE LARGE QUANTITIES OF CO TWO AND ONE THAT'S GOING ON YOU'RE NOT REALLY SITTING AROUND WORRYING ABOUT YOUR INVENTORY YOUR WORRYING ABOUT THE FIRE AND THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE. ARE WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THAT SO. WITH RESPECT TO AND NATURAL RESOURCES POLICY THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN HAS A LOT MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT THAN WE HAVE IN PREVIOUS SCOPING PLANTS AND. WE'RE VERY CLEAR THAT. THAT OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS NEED TO BE. IN BETTER SHAPE BOTH TO CONSERVE THE CARBON THAT'S STORED THEY ARE NOW IN OUR LAND AND AND PLANTS AND AT THE SAME TIME. TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO OUR PREVENT. RELEASES THAT. IT CAN REALLY I HAVE A. VERY DRAMATIC EFFECT ON ON GLOBAL WARMING OVERALL AS DROUGHT CONTINUES AS WE HAVE. MORE STRESSES ON OUR ECOSYSTEMS. THIS IS NOT MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE HAVE TO TAKE STRONG ACTION. TO PROTECT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES IN WAYS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO PERFORM THE FUNCTIONS THAT THEY NEED TO PERFORM IN TERMS OF ABSORBING A CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. OF THE ARAB STATES AT THROUGH THE RESOURCES AGENCY HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK ON OCEANS AND SOME AS THERE'S A NOW IN THE WORKS AT A FOREST CARBON PLAN. BUT I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HERE THIS IS ALSO A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM I KNOW. MENTIONING THE POSSIBILITY OF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA PLAYING ANY KIND OF A ROLE IN PROTECTING FORESTS ELSEWHERE. CAUSES A LOT OF PEOPLE TO BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD BE FIRST LOOKING AT OUR OWN. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES BUT AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT THE GLOBAL INVENTORIES WE'VE KNOWN FOR DECADES NOW THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE. THE THE LEVELS OF LIMITATION ON EMISSIONS AT THE LEVELS OF HAVE CONTROL OVER WARMING THAT WE'RE AIMING FOR WITHOUT INCLUDING AT NATURAL RESOURCES IN THAT THAT IS IF WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW OUR. TROPICAL FORESTS OR OUR TEMPERATE FORESTS TO BE DEGRADED OR TO DISAPPEAR WE WON'T MAKE IT NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WESTCAR SO WHERE POWER PLANTS OR WHATEVER SO. THAT'S KIND OF THE THAT THE BASIC ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. YOUR SECOND QUESTION I THINK WAS ABOUT. FEDERAL OVERSUPPLY SO THE OVERSUPPLY SORRY OVER SPY. SO ON SHRINKING THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES AS. AS WAS INDICATED BY MY COLLEAGUE HERE THERE'S ALWAYS A TENSION BETWEEN THE DESIRE TO KEEP PRICES MODERATE AND PREDICTABLE AND TO MAKE THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTABLE UNDERSTANDABLE. AND EFFECTIVE AND FREE OF SCANDALS IN HOW TO DEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE. THE POSSIBILITY OF A COMPANY COMING IN AND BUYING UP A LOT OF ALLOWANCES SPEAKS THEIR CHEAP NOW AND THEN IN HOARDING THEM UNTIL SOME LATER TIME. WE PUT HOLDING LIMITS IN THE FACT ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THAT REGARD HAS MADE PEOPLE WHO ARE MARKET AT. EXPERTS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRADE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET FOR OUR ALLOWANCES. QUITE UNHAPPY BUT BECAUSE IT'S A MUCH LESS EXCITING MARKET THAT WAY THE WAY WE IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM LOOKS A LOT MORE LIKE A REGULATION THAT IT DOES LIKE YOU KNOW WE ALL COME OUT AND JUST DAY TRADE ALLOWANCES AS MUCH AS YOU WANT. WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF A PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS DOING ITS JOB IN TERMS OF REALLY SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP INVESTING AND BE INVESTING NOW. IN THINGS THAT ARE GONNA REDUCE EMISSIONS OVER THE LONG RUN AS WE DRIVE TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY SO I'M THAT THOSE OF THE COMING OF QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. AS WE COME UP WITH OUR PROPOSALS FOR HOW TO AMEND THE REGULATION IN RESPONSE TO THE NEW LEGISLATION OUT AND WE'VE HEARD FROM. A LOT OF DIFFERENT FOLKS ABOUT WHAT HOW THEY THINK WE SHOULD DO IT AT WHERE BLAST AND I I MEAN THAT SINCERELY BY. LARGE NUMBERS OF ECONOMISTS AND OTHER MARKET EXPERTS WHO HAVE IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER AND WE HAVE TO TRY THAT REALLY LISTEN BUT ALSO THEN. BAKE SOME MAKE SOME BUT WE'RE ALSO CERTAINLY SEEING SIGNS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT THEY ARE. NOT INTERESTED IN PURSUING ANY MEASURES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT WOULD BE. SUPPORTIVE OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES. IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO. WHERE THE CLEAN AIR ACT WAS? UNDER THREAT WAS IT A EPA WHICH REFUSING TO GRANT WAIVERS TO CALIFORNIA TO DO OUR. MOTOR VEHICLE PROGRAMS THERE ARE STILL THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. BASED ON STATE LEVEL AUTHORITY. ZAREPHATH CERTAINLY MEASURES THAT WE COULD TAKE WHERE. YOU CAN'T DO THIS FOR FUEL EFFICIENCY WITH VEHICLES BUT FUEL EFFICIENCY IN VEHICLES THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW POLICIES THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND ELSEWHERE IN TERMS OF. MAKING BUILDINGS ZERO THAT ENERGY THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT AS ALTERNATIVES ON TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD BE DOING. MORE DIRECTLY WHERE THINGS WE CAN DO IN THE AS A STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE AREA OF LAND USE AND. PROMOTING. MORE BICYCLE AND WALKING FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES IN A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY GOING ON NOW BUT THAT COULD BE GIVEN MORE. EMPHASIS. AS PART OF STATE PROGRAM THAT WAS DESIGNED TO TO DEAL WHETHER A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WASN'T SUPPORTIVE BUT. I MEAN I THINK THE. I AM HOPEFUL THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY OTHER STATES THAT ARE PURSUING. BOTH FOLLOWING OUR VEHICLE REGULATIONS AND LOOKING AT SOME OF OUR OTHER CLIMATE REGULATIONS AND MORE STATES ACTUALLY LOOKING TO GET INTO. THINGS LIKE PUTTING A PRICE ON CARBON. AYE I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP OUR MOMENTUM GOING. THANK YOU MISS SKINNER. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR THEIR PRESENTATION AND FOR TWO CHEERS FOR. HOLDING THE. HEARING. COUPLE COMMENTS COUPLE QUESTIONS. OF FOLLOWING UP ON SENATOR STEARNS ISSUE OF. THESE TYPES OF INCIDENTS THAT CREATES THE UNANTICIPATED EMISSIONS IN HERE OF COURSE REFLECTING ON A LEASE OR CANYON WE KNOW THERE'S ALSO. WHICH WE CALL IT AND. JUST ESCAPED. WHETHER METHANE OR YES I FROM OUR WHOLE SYSTEM OF OUR NATURAL GAS SYSTEM. AND DE ESTIMATES ON THAT VERY SO THAT'S ONE BUT THE OTHER IS LIKE VW'S. THEY'RE. ALL COLLEGE KI?M HAD TO MOMENT. INCREASE KNOCKS RIVER NOW I DON'T KNOW I'D IF EFFECTED ALL FUEL EFFICIENCY BUT KNOX'S A GREENHOUSE GAS OR INDIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS ANYWAY SO IT WAS. WHAT LEVEL? OF. OF INCREASED GHGS THAT ACTION PUT NOW I RAISE THESE ISSUES NOT THAT WE CAN SO MUCH. WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT TYPE OF UNANTICIPATED EMISSIONS BUT WE CERTAINLY IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT FOR OUR SCOPING PLAN. WE SHOULD IN FUTURE. YEAH I'D. A COULD AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT THEN AFFECT THE. LIKE THE MARGIN BUT YEAH AFTER A BLANK RIGHT FOR THE UNANTICIPATED INSTEAD OF THE ONLY. SO WE HAVE THIS TARGET SO HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW AND BOOM BOOM BOOM ONLY ON WHICH WE KNOW. JUST A COMMENT QUICKLY ABOUT pTHAT BEFORE I. COHEN WELL. YES IT YOU'RE MAKING A GOOD POINT JUST ON THE ON THE VOLKSWAGEN SITUATION WE WORKED WITH THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT IN OUR ENFORCEMENT ACTION AFTER WE UNCOVERED THE FRAUD. WITH THE DEFEAT DEVICES THAT THE COMPANY WAS USING THAT WE NOT ONLY WERE WORKING TOWARDS PENALTIES FOR WHICH WE SHOULD BE NORMAL. BUT ALSO THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PUT MONEY INTO A SPECIAL FUND. THAT WAS DESIGNED TO OB ALLOW FOR AYE EVERY STATE THAT WAS AFFECTED BY THIS WHICH WAS EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AYE AND AND TRIBES AS WELL ACTUALLY TO. A RECEIVE FUNDS THAT COULD BE USED TO CREATE NEW REDUCTIONS AND KNOCKS. THAT WOULD OFFSET LITERALLY POUND FOR POUND THE ADDITIONAL KNOCK STAFF COURSE THAT KNOCKS THAT WAS RELEASED AS A RESULT OF A VOLKSWAGEN DID IS ALREADY OUT THERE THE ATMOSPHERE DOING ALL THE HARM THAT IT COULD DO. BUT GOING FORWARD WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO HELP TURN OVER THE DIESEL FLEET FOR EXAMPLE IN WAYS THAT WELL. BILL THEN PERMANENT KNOCKS REDUCTIONS WITH THE MONEY THAT WILL BE GETTING OUT OF THAT FUND SO I THINK ALL IN ALL THAT WAS THAT. THAT WAS A TERRIFIC SETTLEMENT UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN I'M SORRY I JUST CAN'T RESIST THIS BUT THE ARM WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS NOW DECIDED THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THOSE KINDS OF SETTLEMENTS IN THE FUTURE SO. WE HAVE ANOTHER PENDING AYE CASE AGAINST ANOTHER COMPANY THAT WAS DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR. TO A VOLKSWAGEN DEAD AND. WE WILL NOT BE GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF HELP AND COLLABORATION WITH THAT. AT WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT WE DID IN THE PAST BOB BUT. IN TERMS OF THE CERTAINTY THAT WE HAVE OF ACHIEVING. PRECISE LEVELS OF REDUCTION. AS THE SCIENCE OF THIS IS SORT OF IN ITS INFANCY I MEAN YOU CAN MEASURE CO TWO DIRECTLY COMING OUT OF THE STACK. BUT TO MEASURE. IN WITH GREAT PRECISION THE. EMISSIONS OF. METHANE THAT ARE COMING OUT OF A PIPELINE OR UMPS AID MULTIPLE DIFFERENT SOURCES. WHO YOU WOULD HAVE TO AT IMPLEMENTED A KIND OF MONITORING SYSTEM THAT WE DON'T HALF NOW I MEAN YOU CAN DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF ESTIMATING BASED ON? THE PRODUCT THAT'S PUT IN VERSUS THE PRODUCT THAT YOU END UP WITH AT THE OTHER END OF THE SYSTEM BUT. IT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT AND OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW. ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WHERE ALL THOSE EMISSIONS ARE COMING FROM SO. AND DO THAT. I THINK A LOT OF THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE REALLY CHANGES THAT TIGHTEN UP ON THE WHOLE SYSTEMS OR THAT SUBSTITUTE INHERENTLY LESS POLLUTING. PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES OVERALL SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO JUST KEEP PATCHING. THE CURRENT SYSTEM BUT REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR MORE TRANSFORMATIVE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES. SO WE. I THINK IT IS WORTH CONSIDERING IN FUTURE UPDATES. A. THE PORTION OF THIS SCOPING PLAN ON THE ON ANTICIPATED RUBEN. SPEAKING TOWARDS THAT OF. IT'S NOT A PERFECT SCIENCE OR GO TO THE LA OR REPORT FOR MINUTES SO. YOU FOCUSED ON AND. SHE BROWN YOU FOCUSED ON THE. PORTION. OF THAT IF THESE ALLOWANCES THAT HAVE BEEN BANKED. GET USED INSTEAD OF THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE THAT THE CAP AND TRADE SECTION AT LEAST WILL NOT FULLY MEET THE TARGETS THAT WE INTENT NOW. WHAT WHAT WASN'T CLARIFIED WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT CLARIFY IN THE DISCUSSION IS THAT? THE IN THE UPDATED SCOPING PLAN AND AND MISS NICHOLS YOU CAN. CLARIFY. DE THE AMOUNT OF SO WE HAVE BEEN S. B. THIRTY TWO GOALS. YET DID SCOPING PLAN HAS MEASURES IN VARIOUS THINGS AND IT SHOWS WHAT PERCENT OF THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS IS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. WE EXPECT ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE S. B. THIRTY TWO GOAL IN THEIR CABIN TREES ARE CORRECT. YEAH I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT NUMBER AND I THINK THE NEXT JOB FORTY THIRD LITTLE DOES NOT FORTY SNUFF FOR YOU CAN GET JUST LIKE IT'S. MAYBE THIRTY FIVE BUT IT'S UNDER FORTY. NOW EVEN IF IT'S A. VERY WE HAVE THE WORST CASE SCENARIO YOU DESCRIBED AS FAR AS I CAN TELL YOU WOULD STILL KNOCKER TOTAL TARGET OFF BY LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. GIVEN WHAT PERCENT IT IS OF OUR OF WHAT WE INTENT. SO NOW THAT'S NOT TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU RAISED BUT I WONDER IF THE LA ALWAYS PLANNING. IN A SIMILAR SUSSMAN ON THE WHOLE SCOPING PLAN. AND THEY AN IVORY SICK BECAUSE. WHILE THE CONTINUATION CAP AND TRADE IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY NON. HE DID A. IT DOMINATED MUCH OF OUR SESSION LAST YEAR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. ALL OF US ON IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE TO REALIZE IT IS ONLY THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL GOAL. AND SO IT AS WE FOCUS ON. WHAT IT IS BEFORE US THAT WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO TO STAY FOCUSED ON? AND SO WHAT. ANYWAY COMMENT AND THEN ALL S. DIVE TO OTHER QUESTIONS. YEAH I'M GONNA. I GUESS. IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO ME KIND OF WHERE THE THE TEN PERCENT SORT OF A LOOK ON ONLY ON THIRTY PERCENT OF. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE S. B. THIRTY TO CALL. AND EVEN UNDER YOUR CHART. IF ALL THE BANK EMISSIONS ARE USED. WHILE EMISSIONS WOULD BE HIGHER THAN WHAT. THE INTENT IS FOR CAPITATE REDUCE THEY WILL NOT BE HIGHER THAN THEY ARE TODAY. SO WE WOULD STILL ACHIEVE REDUCTION. AND SO WHAT I'VE MY ESTIMATE TEN PERCENT WAS A ROUGH BACK IN THE ENVELOPE BUT THAT EVEN IF THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OF BANKED WE'D ONLY BE OFF BY THE OF THE S. B. THIRTY TWO TARGET BY LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF TOTAL EMISSIONS. YEAH SO I THINK. WHAT WE WHAT WE CANNOT WAIT OUT IN THE CHART WAS THAT? IT WOULDN'T BE THAT IT WOULD BE THIRTY PERCENT LAST THING KIND OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CAP AND TRADE THINK WHAT WE TRIED TO LAY OUT AS THE SCENARIO WHERE. YOU EVEN IF CAP AND TRADE AS THEIR OVERALL EMISSIONS ARE EVEN THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN WHAT THE ACTUAL TARGET IS SO IT'S NOT. SORT OF YOU KNOW THIRTY PERCENT OF THE MISSION REDUCTIONS. ANTICIPATED FROM CAP AND TRADE THAT SORT OF A SCENARIO WHERE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE OTHER. MEASURES THAT ARE IN PLACE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER THINGS AND EVEN PERHAPS SOME INITIAL REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CAP AND TRADE. YOU COULD STILL FIND YOURSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE OVERALL EMISSIONS. FROM ALL SOURCES. UNDER THE CAP UNDER THE CAP ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN WHAT THE ACTUAL TARGET IS SO I THINK MAYBE IT'S JUST. AND BE HAPPY TO COME OUT. CHAT ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE SORT OF HOW IT RECONCILING THOSE NUMBERS. YOU'RE THE CHART ON THAT YOU REFERENCE TO US ON PAGE EIGHT. IS SOLELY AND ONLY. EMISSIONS UNDER THE UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE TARGET NOT THE FULL AB THIRTY IT'S S. B. THIRTY TWO PACKAGE THEY ARE THERE EMISSIONS UNDER THE CAP FROM CAPS SOURCES. SO THAT INCLUDES KIND OF TRANSPORTATION FUELS ELECTRICITY. INDUSTRIAL SOURCES. THAT THE ONLY BANK ALLOWANCES ARE ALLOWED UNDER CAP AND TRADE NOT UNDER ANY OF THE OTHER. RIGHT BUT THE THE OTHER. AND MISSION REDUCTION POLICIES. ESSENTIALLY ARE KIND OF IMPLICITLY INCORPORATED IN THAT RED LINE THAT YOU SEE THERE SO THAT SORT OF STEADY DECLINE. IN EMISSIONS RECKON ME DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE COULD BE JUST OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS. AS WELL AS OR THE EFFECTS OF OTHER CLIMB UP POLICIES THAT WE HAVE THEIR AFFECTING THOSE OVERALL EMISSIONS. SO WE TRIED TO LAY OUT ISN'T SCENARIO WHERE YEAH THERE THERE THOSE POLICIES ARE HAVING SOME EFFECT OF DRIVING DOWN. EMISSIONS. AND YET STILL WERE KIND OF WITH THIS LARGE BANK OF ALLOWANCES THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ISN'T NECESSARILY NSURING THAT WERE STILL MEETING OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. OKAY I'VE. I THINK I HAVE TO. READ YOUR REPORT CLOSER BECAUSE YOUR CHART IT. IT WOULD BE HARD TO INTERPRET WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED FROM LOOKING AT IT. THAT WAY. AND. DID. THAT ON THE IF I MAY IT OF HOCUS IS ALL THE ATTENTION ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM YEAH AND NOT ENOUGH ON THE. OPERATIONS OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WOULD LEAD COMPANIES THAT ARE UNDER THIS PROGRAM TO DECIDE WHETHER NOT TO. CLEAN UP VERSUS USE ALLOWANCES HOLD ONTO ALLOWANCES AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT MAKES THE WHOLE. MARKET SYSTEM LESS THAN PERFECTLY PREDICTABLE AS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW AN INDIVIDUAL% EXECUTIVE OF A COMPANY IS GOING TO LOOK AT. THE FUTURE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TECHNOLOGY PRICES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN WHICH. YOU KNOW SO FAR BASED ON EXPERIENCE WE KEEP FINDING THAT EVERYTHING WHETHER IT'S SOLAR OR. WHATEVER OUR GETS CHEAPER RATHER THAN MORE EXPENSIVE AND SO PEOPLE AND UP ACTUALLY DECIDING TO CLEAN UP VERSUS. BUYING ALLOWANCES AND THEREFORE THE ALLOWANCES BECOME LESS USEFUL AND LESS IMPORTANT EVEN IF THEY'RE OUT THERE. SO I PAID THEM WE DON'T I'M ASSURE OTHER PEOPLE MAY ONE OF FOLLOW THE BUT I DO WANNA GO DEEPER IT NOW UNTIL I. READ THIS HOLY SILICON ASK THE QUESTIONS APPROPRIATELY BUT. WAY IN MY LOOKING AT IT AND FROM WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY. FIRE HERDED AS THAT THIEF IF THE COMPANIES USE THE FULL AMOUNT A BANK ALLOWANCES. THEY WOULD GO ABOVE WHAT THEY'RE CAP IS UNDER CAP AND TRADE BUT THAT THAT WOULD NECESSARILY BRING US. ABOVE. OUR TOTAL S. B. THIRTY TWO CHICHI REDUCTION GOAL NOW AGAIN ALL LOOK AT IT MORE CAREFULLY BUT THAT BRINGS ME. TO. IF SINCE THE HEARINGS ON SCOPING PLAN THAT AS MISS NICHOLS POINTED OUT. OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF EMISSIONS IS TRANSPORTATION. AND TRANSPORTATION IS ONLY MINIMALLY AFFECTED BY CAP AND TRADE. AND. SO WE DO HAVE OBVIOUSLY OTHER THINGS IN THE SCOPING PLAN AROUND TRANSPORTATION. BUT WHAT. FOR ME. THAT THE. OR CALL ABSENCE OF CPAS CIVIC. GHG REDUCTION TARGETS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE TRANSPORTATION. SYRIA GIVEN HOW MUCH OF OUR GIGI EMISSIONS IT IS. I'M GIVES ME SOME CONCERN. AND AND I AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE HAVING GOOD SUCCESS FOR EXAMPLE TO LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS I KNOW THAT THERE'S WE'D YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING LOTS OF WORK ON FOR EXAMPLE ELECTRIFYING TRANSPORTATION. BUT AGAIN I'M THAT THAT ABSENCE OF. MORE SOLID. TARGETS RUN THE TRANSFERRED IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS GROWTH. WELL I MEAN I THINK A SAID AN AND INTERESTING AND USEFUL COMMENT IT IS. TRUE THAT THIS SCOPING PLAN REALLY BUILDS ON PASSED SCOPING PLANS AND PASS SCOPING PLANTS HAVE BUILT ON THE EXISTING REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT WERE ALREADY IN PLACE. AND IT COULD BE THAT IF WE STEPPED BACK AND SAID LET'S LOOK AT OUR ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WOULD GET MORE. REDUCTIONS OUT OF THAT. YOU MIGHT COME UP WITH SOME DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT. IT'S A MY TWO LAST QUESTIONS ARE ONE IS CARBON IN. IN HOUSEHOLDS SO WE'VE OBVIOUSLY HAVE ROBUST ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS WE'VE GOT. A FIFTY PERCENT. RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD NOW BEFORE ASSIST POTENTIAL FOR A HUNDRED PERCENT. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CARBON ESPECIALLY IN THE COASTAL HOUSEHOLDS WITHIN THEIR. NATURAL GAS. THROUGH THEIR WATER HEATING THEIR SPACE SEEING THEIR. OVENS IN SUCH DEMAND. D. EFFICIENCY MEASURES. ARE GOOD BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY AIMED THEIR AIMED AT DOING THAT MOST EFFICIENTLY BUT NOT NECESSARILY DE CARBON ICING THAT PORTION OF THE CARBON IN OUR HOUSEHOLDS. AND. THE SCOPING PLAN DOESN'T REALLY REFERENCE IT MUCH EITHER AND I WONDERED IF CARP IS GIVEN MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT. WELL I THINK WHAT THE FOCUS OF A THE FOCUS ON NATURAL GAS HAS COME MORE THROUGH THAT SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT. WAYS YOU COULD. MAKE A LARGER MORE DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS AND. I KNOW THERE'S A. A. SUGGESTION THAT IN THE FUTURE WE SHOULD NOT. BE USED NATURAL GAS AT ALL FOR SOME OF THE PURPOSES THE AND WE WHERE YOU COULD SUBSTITUTE ELECTRIFICATION AND THE ELECTRICITY COULD COME FROM RENEWABLE. RESOURCES AND THE NATIONAL GAS INDUSTRY HAS VERY. AGGRESSIVELY REFUTED THAT IDEA USING AS THE NOTION OF A SORT OF A SYSTEM WHERE THEY COULD FIND WAYS TO GET MORE GHG REDUCTIONS OUT OF THEIR SYSTEM. THROUGH. VARIOUS NEW TECHNOLOGY IS AS YET NOT REALLY TESTED THAT BUT OR BUT THAT THEY THEY COULD BE TESTING THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE WAYS IN WHICH YOU COULD USE NATURAL GAS TO ACTUALLY. REDUCE A CO TWO EMISSIONS OVERALL FROM. FROM MANY ACTIVITIES INCLUDING DRIVING IF THEY USE SOME OF THAT TO MAKE HYDROGEN IS MORE OF IT TO MAKE HYDROGEN TO. OPERATE. TO OPERATE JET FUEL CELLS SO AB ED USE STORAGE AS A WAY THAT. PUT TASK GAS AB BACK INTO THE SYSTEM SO ANYWAY I AM I THINK THESE. KIND OF BIG POLICY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE LIKE THAT BUT. IN THE MEANTIME OUR FOCUS HAS REALLY BEEN MORE ON WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT HAVE KIND OF DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY OVER BUILDING. AND EFFICIENCY OR CITING OF FACILITIES AND SO FORTH RATHER THAN KIND OF TRY TO TAKE ON THAT THAT WHOLE ISSUE. THEN LASTLY I WONDERED SORRY I WONDERED IF CARD HAD LOOKED AT. ANY DATA. ON THE GHG REDUCTION DURING THE PERIOD OF THE GOVERNOR'S WATER USE REDUCTION ORDER. I HAD SEEN SOME DATA. THAT. DUE TO THE WATER USE REDUCTION. THAT ARE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS WHATEVER LESS WATER BEING PUMPED LESS WATER BEING HEATED LESS WATER IT AND WE KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY PERCENT OF ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE IS. DO YOU JUST WATER PUMPING ALONE. AND. YOU KNOW AGAIN THE DATA I SAW. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS. BUT. FROM A SMALL SOURCE OR WHETHER IT WAS LARGER. BUT IT SEEMED COMPELLING AND I WONDERED IF ANY STATE AGENCIES WERE LOOKING AT THAT. THE WATER BOARD I BELIEVE HAS A CONTRACT WITH. THE CLIMATE. REGISTRY TO DEVELOP A PROTOCOL FOR LOOKING AT EXACTLY THAT. ISSUE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MORE WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY BEEN COMPLETED. THERE DEFINITELY IS CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WATER IS CONSERVED IS IT JUST SENT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND IF SO HOW DOES THE ENERGY ACTUALLY GET SAVED IN THE LONG RUN. ME THIS NO QUESTION IF YOU MAKE THE PUMPS MORE EFFICIENT YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE. EMISSIONS BECAUSE THERE'S WHATEVER PUMPING IS DOWN WILL BE USING CLASS AT WILL BE CREATING FEWER EMISSIONS BUT IF YOU TALK ABOUT WATER AS HOT AS A WHOLE AS A SYSTEM. WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU REALLY HAVE TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT WHERE IT GOES AND AND BUT GETS DONE OF THAT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE USEFUL GIVEN THAT WE HAD A PERIOD OF TIME WAS THE GOVERNOR'S REDUCTION ORDER IN EFFECT ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS. AM. SO THE MAN FEDERAL RATE OF TIME RIGHT SO WE CAN PROBABLY GET THE DATA I'M FROM ME AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO SPECULATE WOULD BE THE BEST SOURCES BUT WE COULD BE SINCE WE KNOW THE WINDOW. IF PERIOD AND WE KNOW WHAT WATER USE REDUCTION WAS ACHIEVED COULDN'T WE GET USING THAT. TIME PERIOD DATA FROM THE THE APPROPRIATE ENTITIES TO LOOK AT WHETHER THERE WAS A ASSOCIATED. REDUCTION IN. ELECTRICITY YOU'RE NOW TO THE OTHER USE. WHICH WOULD THEN GIVE US SOME INSIGHT RATHER THAN. BECAUSE AGREED WE WE DON'T KNOW BROADLEAF WHETHER THE SAVING OF WATER IN FACT IT'S JUST SAVING IT HERE AND ISN'T NECESSARILY GET USED ELSEWHERE BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS SNAPSHOT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET SOME REAL DATA. SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD JOB FOR THE ALEJO. YEAH. THANK YOU CHARLIE. THAT WAS IT. DID YOU MIND IF I. JUST ADD ONE THING ON THAT POINT. THAT I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A RECENTLY RELEASED STUDY OR AT LEAST A WORKING PAPER. WHICH I BELIEVE WAS LOOKING AT WATER CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND CALIFORNIA AND EFFORTS TO PROMOTE WATER CONSERVATION AND HOUSEHOLDS ONE OF THE FINDINGS SEEM TO BE. ADJUSTED WHO NOT ONLY TO THOSE EFFORTS SHORT OF. AFFECT WATER CONSERVATION PROMOTE CONSERVATION WATER AND ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH LEADING ARE MOVING THAT WATER. BUT ALSO IT HAD TREATING IT LATER RIGHT BUT IT ALSO HAD THE. AFFECT OF AFFECTING PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR JUST ON THEIR SHARE ELECTRICITY USE. AND SO THERE WAS KIND OF AN INTERESTING AND I THINK HYPOTHESIS THAT MAYBE JUST OR GREATER ATTENTION TO THINGS LIKE WATER CONSERVATION COULD ALSO HAVE SOME POTENTIAL SPILLOVER EFFECTS ON. OTHER TYPES OF ENERGY USE ON HAPPY TO. TRY AND FIND THAT I THINK WORKING PAPER IN AND SEND IT TO YOU. CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER WHO TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR FOR. PUTTING THIS TOGETHER THIS IS ONE OF THE. OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO MEET. CHAIRPERSON HIGH NICHOLS AND. AND ANSWER SOME REALLY POINTED QUESTIONS ABOUT. THE SCOPING PLAN. OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW IT IT. TOOK TWO YEARS FOUR MONTHS AND SIX DAYS TO GET SB ONE APPROVED. THAT'S THE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING BILL. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE HERDING CATS TRYING TO GET THIS COMPREHENSIVE. FIX TO TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON THE HIGHWAYS. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCOPING PLAN IS COMING TO ME IT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE WHEN WE START TAKING AND REDUCING VEHICLE TRAVELED MILES. WITH CARS WHICH THEN NOW IF WE REDUCING THAT WE'RE REDUCING THE INPUT OF MONEY INTO THE MAIN THIS OF HIGHWAYS. AND PUTTING MORE RESERVES WHICH IS A LAUDABLE GOAL. BUT WE ACTUALLY. HAD SUCH A HARD TIME TRYING TO EVEN GET A FIGURE IMPLEMENTED. FOR DESERVES TO BE PART OF THE REGISTRATION. TO PAY THEIR SHARE SOMEWHAT OF A SHARE. OF THEIR IMPACT ON THE ROADS. SO. WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE VEHICLE MILES OR THE ROAD USER CHARGE WE EVER IN THE NEAR FUTURE BE. ADOPTED BECAUSE OF PUBLIC. ANGST WITH HOW. IT'S PERCEIVED AS BIG BROTHER. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WE WORK SO HARD TO GET. AND TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE ROADS FOR THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA WITH THE FREIGHT DYNAMIC AND AND WHAT OT AND THE AND SAFETY AND AND ALL THE THINGS IMPACTED BUT HERE. THIS SCOPING PLAN TAKES AWAY FROM IT. HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT GOING FORWARD NUMBER ONE? AND THEN. WE'RE LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW SOLUTIONS HOW DO WE GET TO YES RIGHT. WE WANT TO BE. CONSCIOUS OFATTAINMENT OF OF OF THE AGENCY'S GOALS. BUT. THEN AGAIN WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY DIMINISHES ANOTHER AGENCIES GOALS. AND SO. THAT BEING SAID. YOU KNOW. I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT THERE CAN BE SOME KIND OF DISCUSSION. ON AND AND I KNEW I HAD A REALLY GOOD AUTHORISATION WITH RICHARD YOU'RE YOU'RE NEAR EXACT DIRECTOR. ABOUT PARTNERING. WITH. CALTRANS IN THE PORTS ABOUT MINIMIZING CONGESTION OUT OF THE PORTS BASED ON. IMPACTS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE WE WE WE REGULATE THE PORT TO THE GATE. AND THEN FROM THAT POINT FORWARD. WE DON'T CARE. AND SO. BUT THE LARGEST IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITIES IS PASS I GAVE. AND SO I WAS HOPING THAT IN THE SCOPING FAMILY WE WOULD ADDRESS THAT IN ITS THEN IT COULD BE TO THE STRATEGIC FREE PLAN ALSO. THAT THAT THERE'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE AGENCIES THAT ACTUALLY IF WE REDUCE CONGESTION. THERE ARE SO MANY BY PRODUCTS OF VALUE THAT CAN BE HAD. WERE WE GET MORE THROUGHPUT MOBILITY FOR THE ECONOMY. WE AT REDUCE THE IMPACT ON THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WE ACTUALLY THEN ARE MORE OF VIABLE TWO OTHER SOURCES OF SHIPPERS WHO WANT TO COME TO CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT NOW. WE'RE DOING FORTY PERCENT AND. HE'LL THE STIGMA IS THAT WERE SO OVER REGULATED NOW THAT A LOT OF SHIPPERS ARE CONSIDERING BECAUSE THEY CAN. BECAUSE OF THE PANAMA CANAL EXPANSION GO ELSEWHERE. AND DID BEING THAT'S A THIRD OF OUR ECONOMY ONE OF OUR LARGEST WORKFORCE IS WHAT I'M HOPING THAT WE. AS A AS A WHOLE CAN IDENTIFY REAL GOOD WORK AND THOSE REPORTS HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC ABOUT PARTNERING. BUT IN THE SCOPING PLAN I DON'T SEE ANY MENTION. OF. THAT. VIABILITY OF OF TAKING. A LEAD ROLE WITH WITH NOW THAT WE'VE DONE THIS WITH SP ONE. THERE'S MONEY. AND AND AND INCENTIVIZING THAT PROCESS WE LOOK AT ANOTHER VENUE SO HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT WELL AND. I THINK. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE POINTING OUT IS THAT NO ONE AGENCY SHOULD OR COULD BE IN CONTROL OF ALL OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AT THE SAME TIME. AND THAT YOU NEED AT A GOVERNOR AND AGENCIES THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO COORDINATE THOSE DIFFERENT CALLS AND I SIT AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT. WORKING GROUP I'M I'M JUST ONE MEMBER BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH OF STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND CALTRANS AND THE PORTS AROUND THAT EXACT ISSUE. AND TO RIGHT BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS I MET WITH THE. SHIPPERS TO TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION GOING FORWARD. UP PARTICULARLY AROUND HOW THEY CAN GET TO THE KINDS OF INCREASES IN EFFICIENCY AND SPEED OF THROUGHPUT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WITHOUT JUST BEING. SADDLED WITH MORE REGULATORY BURDENS SO IT'S EXACTLY THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WE ARE VERY ARAB COMMITTED TO THAT GOAL OF. MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL. ROLE HAS SAID LOGISTICS AT THE STATE AND SO. WE TRY TO WORK WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER REGULATIONS WERE CONSIDERING OUR PROGRAMS ARE CONSIDERING. ARE ALSO A CONGRUENT WITH WHAT THEY'RE THINKING AND. AYE WE FOUND CONVERSELY THAT YOU KNOW OUR SISTER AGENCIES WHILE CLIMATE CHANGE MAY NOT BE THEIR BIGGEST AT THEIR THEIR NUMBER ROAD. I OPERATIONS SO I FEEL LIKE HOME AS WE ALL A IS SORT OF LIKE SAYING YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON EVERYBODY ELSE BEFORE YOU. TAKE ACTION BUT IT IS TRUE THAT THE SCOPING PLAN IN AND OF ITSELF DOES NOT REFERENCE ALL THE OTHER. PLANS THAT IT IT PASSED TO BE COORDINATED WITH AND MAYBE THERE'S A BETTER WAY FOR THE STATE TO SORT OF. HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT WE HAD THESE DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING ON. AND IT JUST IF YOU COULD TOUCH ON THE OF REDUCTION OF OF. I WOULD SAY FUNDING FOR THE TRICKS OF THE ROAD. MAIN IS FUN WHICH WITH THROUGH THIS. THESE GOALS RIVER COULD YOU ADDRESS OUT OF HOW HOW HOW THAT YOUR YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES IS AUTOMATICALLY R. OR WILL LEAD TO REDUCTION IN. REVENUE YOU FOR FURTHER OUR ROADS IS THAT AS A. A GOOD QUESTION BUT. AT THIS POINT WE'RE SO FAR FROM HAVING THE KIND OF NUMBERS THAT WOULD REALLY HAVE THAT IMPACT THAT IT'S HARD TO SAY. IT IS TRUE THAT OVER TIME. IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL. PETROLEUM IS USE IS GONNA GO DOWN AND THAT WILL MEAN THAT OTHER WAYS TO ACHIEVE REVENUE SERVE AGAIN IN BE NEEDED BUT. WE HAVEN'T LOOKED THAT FAR INTO THE FUTURE BECAUSE IT'S AS MUCH AS WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO PLAN FOR. YOU KNOW TWENTY THIRTY AND THINK ABOUT HEADING TOWARDS TWENTY FIFTY AND WE AB BASED ON ALL THE NUMBERS THAT I'VE SEEN. IT EVEN IN TWENTY FIFTY THERE'S GOING TO BE VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF PETROLEUM CARS. ON THE ROADS IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE. MOON UNIT TOOK TWENTY THREE YEARS TO GET AN ADJUSTMENT IN ANY KIND OF FIX. AND SO IF WE LOOK ABOUT TO DO DIMINISHING RETURNS THAT WE WORK TOWARDS A DIMINISHING RETURN OF FUNDING WHERE RD SEVENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE HOLE. WERE ONLY GETTING FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND NOT ALL THAT'S GOING TO ROSE WHOSE OTHER PROGRAMS. AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE LOOK AT THAT IN SAYING THAT YOU KNOW. EVEN IF WE HAVE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THEY NEED TO HAVE HIGHWAYS ARE THERE EFFECTIVE IN AND SAFE. YOU KNOW AND THEN AGAIN IT'S A VERY LAUDABLE GOAL HAVE ELECTRIC TRUCKS. BUT IF THEY'RE JUST SITTING IN CONGESTION NOT MOVING. YOU KNOW THEY'RE A LOT MORE MONEY AND. WHY WOULD SO MANY BY IT IF THEY'RE JUST SITTING OUTSIDE OF THAT COURT? SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESSING AND CONTINUE. THROUGH THIS PROCESS BECAUSE OUR AND AGAIN WHAT LOVE ABSOLUTE WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING. BUT I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE THAT HAS TO BE CLEAN AND AND TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION. GOINGFORWARD AND. YOU KNOW I KEEP HARPING ON THAT BECAUSE I I SEE. THAT WE GETS IN SILOS AND WE AND WE LOOK CERTAIN ASPECTS. BUT NOT IN ANY GIVEN I I APPRECIATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE A COMPONENT OF THIS I DON'T SEE. A BUSINESS DYNAMIC IN THIS OTHER THAN THE MARKET ANALYSIS COMPONENT. A I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FAIR AND BALANCED. IN. IN THE SCOPING PLANS IN AND AND AND IMPLEMENTATION. OF GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW I MEAN I HAVE THREE DELTA. COMMISSIONS ADULTS ARE SEWER SHIP COULD COUNSEL THOUGH BECAUSE I DON'T CONSERVANCY IN THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION. HANDS ALL BASED AROUND THIS TWIN TOTAL ASPECT RIGHT. BUT WE ONLY HAVE ONE LITTLE COMPONENT. WHEN WE HAVE THIS HUGE DYNAMIC OF MORE THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND SO I THINK THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS TO BE EMBRACED AT SOME POINT. NOT AT SOME POINT NOW. UGH THAT IT IS IS A KEY DYNAMIC FIGURE AND. EMPLOYED FOR THE SCOPING PLANS AND IT IS IN NOT SO I JUST RECEIVED A ONE YEAR AND OUT THE OTHER. THAT ACTUALLY INCLUDE IS IS. BECAUSE THEY'RE THE EXPERTS OKAY. AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU GUYS ARE. THEY DO IT DAY IN AND DAY OUT IN A I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD. RECEIVE THIS EXPORTED ADVICE AND INPUT. TO BE ABLE TO COUNTER BALANCE AND AGAIN WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION WHERE. ROME WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY WE CAN GET HERE OVERNIGHT. A GLIDE PATH BACK TO SUCCESS. IN MY MY WORLD. WHEN IT DOESN'T DAMAGE THE ECONOMY OR AND AND AND THE CONSUMER'S WALLET. IS IS A GREAT WAY TO GO AFTER THOSE YOU KNOW AND SO I HAVE JUST ONE MORE QUESTION. IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED IN MISTER STEARNS QUESTION ABOUT THE WILDFIRES. REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU DO DURING THE YEAR WITH EURASIA SANTA AND THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND THEN WE HAVE THESE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. THAT CAN ZERO ZERO OUT. WHAT YOU'VE DONE ANY YEAR? IZZARD ABILITY FOR. YOUR AGENCY AND COLLABORATION OR CAL FIRE AND OTHER AGENCIES. TO MITIGATE. LOOK AT. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES. YOU KNOW WE USED TO HAVE GRAZING ON STATE LANDS. WE DON'T ANYMORE AND I'M WHAT I'M HEARING FROM IS THE FUELS ARE GETTING LARGER AND GETTING UP INTO THE CANOPY IS BECAUSE OF THIS. AND ANY LOOK AT MAYBE. FASTER RESPONSES OR WHATEVER IT WATER THAT IS. BUT. FOR EVERY STEP WE TAKE FOR WE TAKE TWO STEPS BACK IF THERE'S A NATIONAL DISASTER LIKE THIS. AND SO WHAT WE GAINED IF WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU GUYS CAN ADDRESS. THAT COUPLE AND AGAIN ACT OF GOD WHATEVER IT IS I UNDERSTAND. BUT CAN WE BE A PART OF THAT. EQUATION. SO THAT WE ACTUALLY DO. INCREASE IN VALUE. THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS DO. I THINK YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE I'VE I I INDICATED WE ARE. WORKING WITH THE RESOURCES AGENCY NATURISTS US AGENCY AND OUT CALLIE PA AND THE CONSTITUENT DEPARTMENTS SAT OVER RESOURCES. ON THIS ARE APPROACH TO MANAGING OUR FORESTS FOR HEALTH AT WHICH INCLUDES BEING ABLE TO STORE CARBON. OTHER NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT RANGELANDS. WETLANDS AT RIGHT PARIAN AREAS AND WE'VE GOT. EVEN OUR STATE PARKS. HAVE IN SOME INSTANCES GOT DEGRADED. SITUATIONS WHERE THEY REALLY AREN'T ABLE TO STORE IS MUCH CARBON AS THEY. AS THEY SHOULD AND SO. WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE THINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT'S ALREADY ONGOING AND THE STRESSES THAT THESE PLACES ALREADY ARE ACHIEVING. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO NOW. TO HELP MAKE THEM HEALTHIER THAN THEY ARE AND OBVIOUSLY A RB DOES NOT HAVE THAT. THE WISDOM TO KNOW ALL OF IT ALL THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST AT. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND INVESTED IN TERMS OF BRINGING OUT SOME STAFF THAT HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AGRICULTURE AND AND. LANDSCAPE ISSUES BUT. THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO BE PARTNERING WITH THESE WITH THESE OTHER AGENCIES APPRECIATE MAKING. THINKING IS A FACIAL. MISLIM ON. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR STERN AND ALSO ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER COMMENTS BECAUSE I WANTED TO INQUIRE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. IN IN TERMS OF I KNOW THAT UNDER KIND OF SHORT LIVED CLIENTS WE TALK ABOUT THE BLACK CARBON AND AND. REPRESENTING A DISTRICT THAT HAS JUST HAD THE LARGEST WILDFIRE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. AND WHO SPENT A MONTH OF WEARING MASKS AND KNOWING THAT IN PARTS OF MY DISTRICT. THE AIR QUALITY GOT TO HAZARDOUS NOXIOUS BAD THAT HAZARDOUS. AND HOW YOU KNOW ON DECEMBER NINTH OUR GOVERNOR SAID. THIS IS. NOW THE NORM. CALIFORNIA'S TALKING ABOUT. AND THE FACT THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER STAFF ON A TEMPORARY BASIS AND WILL HAVE TO STAFF ON A TWELVE MONTH BASIS. SO KNOWING ALL OF THIS. IS THERE ARE ABILITY TO RETHINK. ALL TOGETHER THE MEASUREMENT ASPECT NOT JUST WHAT WE DO TO CAPTURE CARBON RIGHT BUT ALSO THE HOW WE MEASURE. BECAUSE I IT'S A NEW REALITY FOR S. I WISH IT WASN'T SO. I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT BUT IF WE'RE NO LONGER TALKING ABOUT SHORT LIVED WHAT KIND OF. EVIDENCE DO WE NEED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE MEASUREMENT ASPECT DEBATE. MANY THINK IT YOU KNOW AGAIN THIS IS IT VERY NEAR IN DEEP THE FIRE STILL BURNING IN MY DISTRICT. IT'S NOT OUT YET. BUT. YOU KNOW HOW DOES THE PUBLIC THINK ABOUT THIS. WELL I THINK YOU ALREADY GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT TO THE ISSUE I'M NOT SURE EIGHT. HOW DO I RESPOND EXCEPT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL WITH RESPECT TO THE EXPOSURES THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING? ARM THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS. IN MEASURING EXPOSURE AS OPPOSED TO JUST STICKING A MONITOR OUT SOMEWHERE AND LOOKING AT WHAT THAT HAPPENS TO CAPTURE. SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO AND. TO DEPLOY. BACKPACK SIZE MONITORS THAT YOU COULD. UTILIZED TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE LONGER TERM HEALTH EFFECTS AND THE SHORT TERM AFFECTS OF. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A FIRE THAT THAT NOT THAT THEY SHOULDN'T PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY FIRST OF ALL NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE DANGER BUT THEN WHEN THEY COME BACK AGAIN INTO COMMUNITIES WHERE THE FIRES ARE? YOU KNOW NOT RIGHT NEXT TO THEM THE AIR QUALITY CAN STILL BE VERY BAD. AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT NOT ONLY MEASURING WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING BUT ALSO LOOKING AT WAYS TO. PROTECT THEM BETTER IN THOSE SITUATIONS FROM THE IMPACTS OF OF WHAT THEIR BREATHING AND WE'RE NOT REALLY AT AT THIS POINT. THING GEARED UP TO DO THAT VERY EFFECTIVELY I THINK WE'VE WORKED WITH THE LOCAL DISTRICTS TO. GET TIMELY INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THE AIR QUALITY IN THEIR AREA IS LIKE AND TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO. AVOID. BREATHING TOO MUCH OF IT BUT IT OUT IT'S STILL IS NOT A. IT'S NOT A SITUATION THAT I THINK IS IDEAL THE. THE MESSAGE AND I KNOW THAT. PEOPLE AND THEIR. NATURAL RESOURCES FIELD AND IT. CAL FIRE FOR YEARS HAVE TRIED TO WORK WITH LOCAL LAND USE AGENCIES TO. AT. TRY TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT ADD TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL ABOUT BUILDING ON THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND THE NEED TO HAVE CLEARED AREAS AROUND WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING AND NOT. TO CONTINUE TO. JUST YOU KNOW. HAVE. DEVELOPMENT KIND OF IN THE MIDST OF A FORESTED AREAS WHERE IT ISN'T REALLY EFFECTIVE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGHT FIRES ONCE THEY START. AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE AN AREA THAT THEY WOULD NEEDS TO BE MORE ATTENTION PAID I KNOW. LOOKING AT. GUIDELINES FOR THAT TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITHIN. PROBABLY THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AND ELSEWHERE ITEM AT I MEAN I THINK WE JUST ALL AS A STATE ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE RISK. THEN WE HAVE BEEN A FAR. THIS BURKE. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION. A WAS BACK TO US CENTER SKINNER'S QUESTION WHICH SO TRIED AND IT'S BACK TO BEING THE BANKING. SO TRADITIONALLY WE'VE WE'VE BEEN EARLY TO MEET OUR GOALS BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WITH THIRTY PERCENT AND PERCENT RANGE OF OF ARTICLES BEING MET BY CAP AND TRADE. AND. I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH OF BANKING OF THE BANKING OF OF CREDITS IS REALLY GOING TO. BE IN ISSUE AND HOW FAR IN ADVANCE WE WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE LEGISLATIVELY BECAUSE YOU SAID IT'S A POLICY ISSUE. I'M WONDERING HOW FAR IN ADVANCE FROM TWENTY THIRTY WE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION OR ENOUGH DATA. TO KNOW WHEN WE WOULD HAVE TO AFFECT THAT POLICY. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER FOR YOU I THINK WE HAVE TO BE. LOOKING AT THE ALBUM DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. MIA AS WE MOVE IT TO TWENTY TWENTY AND BEYOND TO HAVE SOME MEASURES OF FOR. TAKING STOCK OF WHERE THAT ALLOWANCES ARE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THEM. TO HAVE A BETTER PICTURE OF IT. BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS IT IS SORT OF LIKE. TRADING IN DERIVATIVES IT'S TRADING ENOUGH AN INSTRUMENT IF NOT TRADING IN A REAL PHAGOCYTE IT OUT IT AT ALL VIOLENCE REPRESENTS AN ABILITY TO IN THAT IT DOESN'T REPRESENT THE ACTUAL EMISSION. AND SO IF YOU'RE TRACKING WHERE THE EMISSIONS ARE COMING FROM WHICH WE CAN DO WITHOUT THE REPORTED DATA. THEN YOU CAN SEE IF THERE'S SOME TYPE OF SOURCE WHERE YOU'RE GETTING INCREASES IN ACTUAL EMISSIONS AND PEOPLE USING ALLOWANCES TO COMPLY. AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER SENSE OF WHERE YOU NEEDED TO GO WITH A MORE TARGETED. APPROACH AND I THINK WITH THE ANNUAL. REPORTING AND. REVEALING THAT WE'RE DOING THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THOSE KINDS OF TRENDS HAPPENING OBEY SO FAR THE GOOD NEWS IS SPEND THAT ON THAT. EITHER ELECTRICITY SIDE WE'VE SEEN OUR REDUCTIONS HAPPENING FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA HAPPEN THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE RIGHT IS YOU KNOW THE CULMINATION OF PRICING ON THE REGULATIONS. MOVING PEOPLE IN THE DIRECTION THAT THAT WE ALL WANTED TO GO BUT DOING IT EVEN FASTER BECAUSE THE PRICES START TO COME DOWN FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS NOT HAPPENED DID AND UP IN THE PLAY. AND THE PROCESS THAT WE CAN UNDERTAKE MOVING FORWARD. AS A RACE TO ADDITIONAL DIRECT MEASURE. REDUCTIONS. THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AND I ASK THOSE TWO QUESTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF. THE DEFINING OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AS A DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTION MEASURE. AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL LOVE QUESTIONS AND. PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT. AS IT RELATES TO THE CONFLICT THAT IT. SEEMS TO BE ARE PRESENTING OR HOW IT'S BEING INTERPRETED RELATED TO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN IT'S DIRECTED MISSION REDUCTION MEASURES. IN PLACE. THIS IS A I KNOW A DEFINITIONAL PROBLEM AND AYE I AM DON'T WANNA BE AND. NO ONE IS I DON'T TRY TO BRUSH IT OVER AT THE SAME TIME I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE. POINT OUT THE FACT THAT THE. DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. OCCUR FOR VARIOUS REASONS FOR EXAMPLE A PROGRAM THAT PAYS PEOPLE TO TURN IN AN OLD CAR AND GIVES THE MONEY TO BUY A NEW CAR. IS STILL A DIRECT EMISSION THE REDUCTION IN THE SENSE THAT AN OLD CAR IS BEING SCRAPPED AND A NEW CAR IS GOING ON TO THE ROAD SO. REAL EMISSIONS ARE ARE BEING REDUCED. SOME OF OUR MARKET BASED MEASURES GET DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS OUR EVEN THOUGH THEY UTILIZE A DIFFERENT WAY OF. GETTING THERE AND I THINK THAT'S MAYBE BEEN A PROBLEM OF TERMINOLOGY AS THAT WE'VE HAD IN. TRYING TO ADDRESS. THE DESIRE OF THAT I NO I. PEOPLE HAVE FELT TO HAVE MORE MEASURES THAT TARGETED AN INDIVIDUAL SOURCE SOURCE BY SOURCE AND SAID THOU SHALT NOT EMIT MORE THAN EXT AMOUNT AND IF YOU DO. IT OUT BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. OUR ANALYSIS IN THE SCOPING PLAY AND WHERE WE LOOKED AT BOTH CERTAINTY OF ACHIEVING THE OVERALL GOALS AND THE COST OF ACHIEVING THE OVERALL GOALS. WAS THAT YOU REALLY NEEDED A MIX OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEASURES. ALL OF WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON GETTING YOU. REDUCTIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO FIND THE ONES WHERE THE STATE WILL HAVE TO PAY LAST. OUT OF PUBLIC FUNDS AND WHERE. YOU COULD MAKE SURE THAT THE REDUCTIONS WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING SO. AND WE HAVE HAD A VERY. STRONG CONFIDENCE LEVEL THAT WE CAN MONITOR HOW MANY ALLOWANCES ARE OUT THERE WE KNOW WHO HAS THEM WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THEM AND OUT WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FOR. AND WE KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL EMISSIONS OF THE FACILITIES ARE AND SO WE CAN USE THOSE TO DRIVE DOWN. THE EMISSIONS FROM THOSE INDIVIDUAL SOURCES FACILITIES THAT ARE UNDER UNDER THE PROGRAM. BUT WE'VE TRIED TO COMPARE. PROGRAM BY PROGRAM OR STRATEGY BY STRATEGY. ACROSS THE WHOLE FIELD OF OPPORTUNITIES AND TO I'M EVALUATE THEM THAT WAY IN COMPARISON. IN COMPARISON WITH EACH OTHER. SO I TRY RAISE THE QUESTION BREAK BECAUSE ENDED DEBATE AND DELIBERATION OF A AB ONE NINETY SEVEN THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS ASKED IN TERMS OF WHAT IMPACT AND THAT IT HAD ON THE CAP AND TRADE. PROGRAM WAY IN THERE WAS A CONSENSUS THAT THAT WOULD WOULD NOT. BE THE FINDER CONSIDERED A AT LEAST A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS A DIRECT MISSION. THAT REDUCTION THE TOOLOR FOR MY THREE MINUTE RATE THEMSELVES UP I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE STILL LACK OF OF. CAMP CONSENSUS AROUND THAT CONVERSATION I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT WE CONTINUE TO KIND OF. HIGHLIGHT. THOSE DISCREPANCIES EXIST HiA WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY. AROUND THIS ISSUE OF BUT. A DIRECT COMMISSION MEASURE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE. CERTAINLY I GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY WHO REMAIN UNCOMFORTABLE LESS. THAT JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY TO GO. AND. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM JUST LIKE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONVINCE ME. BUT HAVING SAID THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE AND WE'RE VERY. CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE COMPLYING WITH THE. LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF ONE NINETY SEVEN I THINK IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO STILL FEEL THAT THEY WANTED SOMETHING DIFFERENT OR SHOULD OF GOTTEN SOMETHING DIFFERENT. FROM ONE NINETY SEVEN. I I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT I HAD BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN ANY DANGER IN TERMS OF OUR. LEGAL SITUATION. WHAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HANDFUL OF THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL RIGHT THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR INTENTIONS WARY WAS CERTAINLY TIPPED UP BRING FORWARD SOME SOME? FORM OF RELIEF ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND NOT REALLY. BANK ON THAT AS THE TOOL AND DIE SO THE DIRECT ADMISSION COMPONENT EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT IT'S A CONVERSATION I THINK THEY OUGHT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IS CERTAINLY. NOT ONE WHERE YOU KNOW WE'LL GO BACK AND FORTH TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE BUT CERTAINLY FOCUSED ON WHAT'S. YOU KNOW ON IN WRITING IN STATUE IN AND I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WELL AND AGAIN I I KNOW I TALKED A LOT ABOUT SIX SEVENTEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS HEARING TODAY. BUT THERE WAS A REASON FOR THAT HOME WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE. PRINCIPAL CONCERN OF PEOPLE ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS NOT ABOUT THE CO TWO EMISSIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THAT FACILITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT THE TOXICS AND THE HEALTH. HARMING POLLUTANTS AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON THOSE AND NOT ALLOWING THE. G. HD PROGRAM JG PROGRAM TO BECOME A TOOL BUT THESE COMPANIES CAN USE TO INCREASE THEIR EMISSIONS AND WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT. OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS I JUST DID A TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WE DON'T THINK THAT THE CURRENT PERMIT PROGRAMS THAT THE DISTRICTS OPERATE THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW BEEN A PARTY TO ALL THESE YEARS. ARE ADEQUATE BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE SEEING THE LEVELS OF EMISSIONS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO WE HAVE TO FIND BETTER TOOLS TO TO DO IT. BUT WE DON'T THINK OF THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ITSELF IS A NECESSARILY EITHER THE CAUSE OR THE CURE FOR. THAT PROBLEM. THANK YOU. AND I KNOW PIGGYBACK ON A LITTLE BIT OF A MISTER GARCIA JUST. TO SPOKE ABOUT. EARLIER AND A POLY IN OUR AGO WHEN ONE OF YOUR ANSWERS. I. IT WAS A CONVERSATION THAT HAD BEEN STARTED BY MISS SKINNER. ABOUT THE SCHOOL BEING PLANNED AND YOU MADE THE STATEMENT THAT THE SCOPING PLAN IS BUILDING ON. PREVIOUS GOPI IMPLANTS. THAT SHE WAS ASKING THAT WE KNOW ARE WE LOOKING AT OTHER INNOVATIVE WAYS IN THE CONVERSATION REVOLVED AROUND WATER SPECIFICALLY THERE BUT. I I HAVE TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION THOUGH IS THAT FAIR WHEN WE'RE TALKING OF OUR MENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ABOUT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BURDEN. TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE SAME TYPE OF FRAMEWORK THAT HAS LEFT COMMUNITIES BEHIND COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE BEHIND. FOR A LONG TIME AND SHOULD WE BE DOING SURELY BE RELATE A LITTLE BIT LESS ON. CAP AND TRADE I KNOW IT'S NOT THE FULL PORTFOLIO. AND IN HERE RIGHT IT'S ABOUT. FORTY SIX PERCENT BY WEIGHT SEMI GET TO TWENTY THIRTY. SUCH A BIG CHUNK BUT IT WAS ON THE HOLDING I SHOULD ARE WE ARE WE. ARE WE NOT. WHY ARE WE DOING MORE INNOVATIVE STE OF WHERE WE REALLY HAVE THIS COMMITTEE'S COMMUNITIES TO LEAVE WE MADE ENOUGH AND AB SIX SEVENTEEN? WHILE I'M A PRODUCT AUTHOR OF THAT DELICIOUS ONE PIECE OF THE EQUATION IS NOT GONNA SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS EITHER. NOT ALL COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SOUTH FOR AWHILE AS WE MOVE TO DO ON AND SO FORTH AND SO WE KNOW WHY WHY AREN'T WE THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON HAVE. WHAT HAS FELT LIKE YOU KNOW TRICKLE DOWN ENVIRONMENTALISM THAT HAS AND TRICKLE DOWN INTO HIS COMMUNITIES SO? WHAT I GO TO ADVANCE AS WITH PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHO COME TO VISIT US OR EVEN WHEN I HAVE A HOME TRAVELED AS I HAVE A COUPLE TIMES AND? AS PART OF MY JOB TOO INTERNATIONAL EVENTS FOR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH INVESTING IN. COMMUNITIES THAT PROCEEDS OF OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE THEY DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE TERM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS NOT I MEAN THEY VAGUELY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MUST MEAN SOMETHING BUT. IN TERMS OF HOW WE'VE ACTUALLY WORK TO IDENTIFY AREAS AND THEN TO FIGURE OUT. WHO'S A SUBJECTED TO OF BOTH THE. EXPECT CONCERNS ABOUT POVERTY OR ISOLATION AND ALSO OF. IT BE LAYERING ON OF DIFFERENT POLLUTANTS SOURCES. AND THAT WE'RE USING OUR PROGRAM AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. PEOPLE ARE FLABBERGASTED THE IDEA HAS NEVER OCCURRED TO THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A SAY THAT WERE SO BRILLIANT BUT WE ARE DEFINITELY AHEAD OF. OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD IN TERMS OF OUR THINKING ABOUT HOW TO USE OUR CLIMATE PROGRAMS AS A WAY TO ADDRESS INJUSTICES NOW. THE MONEY THAT HAS COME THROUGH OUR PROGRAM AND THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE BUDGET. BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAS GONE TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TWITTER ONLY NOW. BEGINNING TO SHOW THEIR A FAX BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM IS STILL PRETTY NEW BUT WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF YEARS OF EXPERIENCE UNDER OUR BELTS. AND PROBABLY SOME CORRECTIONS TO BE MADE WHERE WE'RE SEEING INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITIES THAT PEOPLE THINK ARE. HELPING TO MOBILIZE OTHER INVESTMENTS AND TO WORK TOGETHER WITH POLICIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY TRY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND HEALTH. IN THE IN THE COMMUNITIES OF CONCERNED SO I THINK I'M GOING BACK TO SOME OF THE EARLIER LEGISLATION. ADDED CENTERED THAT. MONEY BUSINESS ASSEMBLYMEMBER I GUESS THAT I OWN THIS LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF ALLOCATING SPECIFIC PERCENTAGE OF THE FUNDS. TO. TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT POLICY DIRECTIVES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN. I THINK YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OUR HELP US A AND AND AND FOR ALL OF US TO LOOK FOR. MORE CREATIVE WAYS TO ADD TO DO GOOD MONEY IN AND OF ITSELF ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS BUT IT DEFINITELY IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF. AND I WOULD SAY THAT. WHEN AND THAT AS HIS FACE LOOK AT MORE CREATIVE WAYS. LOOKING AT THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. MORE AND AND WITH MORE URGENCY IS IMPORTANT AND I. I PLAY QUICKLY WITH THE MAPPING TOOL VENUE PRESENTED THE VIDEO AND I PULLED UP WITH MY DISTRICT SO. UNDER THAT I HAD SIX FACILITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED. INCOME TRADE OF THE WHEN I LOOK AT MY MAP IT'S ALL PRETTY BRIGHT RED AND IT'S A SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR THAT MOVES ALL THE GOOD FROM THE FOR A LONG BEACH TO THE VALUE OUT OF MY DISTRICT AND THEN ON TO THE WAREHOUSES ON THE OTHER SIDE. THAT ARE AFFECTING ME CLARITY THAT TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS MY BIGGER ISSUE ABILITIES SHE AND OTHER POLLUTANTS OUT THERE AND SO. THIS OVER RELIANCE ON CAP AND TRADE. MIGHT WORK A WHOLE SYSTEM BUT MAYBE MIGHT STILL CONTINUE TO COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE BEHIND. AND SO I JUST THINK WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT I DO THINK IN SOME FAIRNESS AB SIX SEVENTEEN WILL DRESS. PART OF THIS ISSUE AND I I AM ABSOLUTELY THE TO STOP US THE OUT THERE BUT I ALSO KNOW ITS LIMITATIONS AND FUNDING AND ITSELF. BE ENOUGH AND SO. AYE AYE DO YOU JUST ENCOURAGE THAT WE WE THINK ABOUT INNOVATIVE WHAT MORE INNOVATION IN THAT SECTOR. TYPICALLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. DO I HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THEN THAT MEANS WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT SEX OF SECTION. OF OUR HEARING. HAVE. OKAY. SO GO AHEAD AND AND OPEN IT UP WE'VE. WE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. AND I DON'T WANT TO LIVE EVOLVING PATIENT IN IN. SPEAK BUT I WOULD ASK IF YOU CAN TO BE MINDFUL OF THE TIME. AND THAT WE HAVE HERE. DO WE HAVE FOLKS I WANT COUPLE GO AHEAD AND OPEN UP THE MIKE. FOR ANYONE BLUNTLY ALMOST AT ONCE. I'VE NEVER SAID THAT IN A HURRY BUT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GARCIA AND SHARE GARCIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF TO BE HERE MY NAME IS DANNY COHEN WORD I'M A RESEARCHER WITH THE NONPROFIT NEAR ZERO AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WAS SET UP BY EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT. A SPEAK TODAY JUST TODAY MY PERSONAL CAPACITY. WANNA MAKE A VERY BRIEF REMARK ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE SCOPING PLAN BUILDING OFF WHAT DOCTOR BROWN MENTIONED. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO KNOW THAT THE WAY THE SCOPING PLAN CALCULATES EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IS BY PROJECTING THE TOTAL REDUCTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED. THAN TAKING A LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC REGULATORY ACTIONS THINGS LIKE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD A RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THAT ARE REASONABLY WELL QUANTIFIED. AND THEN ESTIMATING THE IMPACTS OF THOSE PROGRAMS. THE GAP BETWEEN THAT AND THE TARGET IS LEFT TO CAP AND TRADE. THERE IS NO ANALYSIS IN THE SCOPING PLAN. OF WHAT MARKET DESIGNED FOR CAP AND TRADE IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THOSE OUTCOMES NO ANALYSIS. IN THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDER BECAUSE AS MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TO COMMITTEES OF MENTION TODAY CAP AND TRADE IS THE SINGLE LARGEST PIECE OF THE SCOPING PLAN IT'S THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE CUMULATIVE PRODUCTIONS THAT ARE BECAUSE FOR OVER THE NEXT DECADE AND IT'S ABOUT FORTY FIVE OR FORTY SIX PERCENT. OF THE REDUCTIONS AIR BECAUSE FOR IN TWENTY THIRTY THAT IS A VERY LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT. BUT THERE'S NO ANALYSIS OF HOW THAT PROGRAM WILL DELIVER ON THE GOAL THAT AIR BE HAS STATED FOR IT. THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO MONITORING TO WATCH GOING FORWARD I'M MINDFUL ALSO THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WAS COMPELLED BY EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT TO FINISH IT SCOPING PLAN LAST MONTH. WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE AB THREE NINETY EIGHT REGULATIONS BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TO SEE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THOSE TWO PROCESSES SO THAT THIS PROGRAM. WHATEVER FLAWS VERY STAKEHOLDER SEEN THE PROGRAM DELIVERS ON THE COMPONENT THAT AREAS CALLED FOR AGAIN THE SINGLE LARGEST COMPONENT. OF OUR CLIMATE PLAN ISN'T CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANNA VASQUEZ I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ROOM TO JUST ALLIANCE. AND RUN ALLIANCE A REPRESENTS TEN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WANNA THINKS AT LEAST I WITH SO HIGH WE HAVE. CLOSELY FOLLOWED THIS ISSUE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AND WE WERE ACTUALLY AT THE BOARD MEETING LAST DECEMBER AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE SAW IS REALLY CALLING CAP AND TRADE AS A DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTION MEASURE. AND FOR US IS A LITTLE BIT PROBLEMATIC GIVEN THAT IT DOES GIVE US DIRECT EMISSIONS BUT IS NOT A MEASURE THAT GIVES US A. DIRECT EMISSIONS AT THE SOURCE AND SPECIFICALLY AT THE FACILITY SOURCES WERE A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE BASE OUT. HE WANTED THINGS AS MENTIONED BIAS MEMBER GARCIA IS HOW DO WE SEE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ONE NINETY SEVEN INCOME IN ON COMPLEMENT AND REALLY COMPLIMENTING CAP AND TRADE. AND I REALLY REPLACING AN AND FOR US IS REALLY SEEN THOSE REDUCTIONS WERE LARGE CESSATION SOURCES ARE LOCATED SPECIFICALLY ALSO MOBILE FORCES AND REALLY GETTING A SENSE OF WHAT MOST PEOPLE. OF WHAT ARE THE MOBILE FORCES REDUCTIONS OF RELEASED FROM TO SEE. TO REALLY MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS BUT ALSO LOOKING AT HOW AB ONE. I'M SIX ONE SEVEN SIX ONE SEVEN. CAN ACTUALLY COMPLEMENT THE CAP AND TRADE A REDUCTIONS ARE CURRENTLY. INSIST TODAY WITH REDUCTIONS THAT WE SEE CURRENTLY THE SCOPING PLAN BUT IT'S NOT REPLACING IT BECAUSE SIX ONE SEVEN IT IS SOMETHING THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE UTILIZING BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE THE ONE FIXING THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE. THAT VOCALIZE POLLUTION MONIES TO BE ADDRESSED SPECIFICALLY WITH THE CRITERIA. ISSUE THAT WE MOVING FORWARD AND REALLY WORKING. WITH CARVE STAFF AND REALLY LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES AND WE REALLY HOPE AND THE NEXT ON COUPLE MONTHS AND NEXT YEAR WE CAN ACTUALLY FINALIZE. POSTSCRIPT UPON THAT CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A SOME BUT IT PRODUCTIONS THAT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE. FOR US NUMBER ONE AT THE SOURCE BUT ALSO TO IS REALLY GETTING A TRANSPARENT SEN THE TRANSPARENCY OF HOW ARE THESE. ADMISSIONS GOING TO BE DONE AND. IN WHAT TIMEFRAME FOR US TO GET A SENSE OF HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE THIS THESE ISSUES IN THESE. EFFORTS TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS SO THANK YOU. DEAR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I RECENTLY RETURNED FROM A YEAR AND A HALF WORKING IN MEXICO'S MINISTER THE ENVIRONMENT HAVING THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEVELOP A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. LIKE CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THE MAIN STICKING POINTS THERE IS THAT GASOLINE PRICES BOARD ALSO REDUCE EMISSIONS. I'M PERSONALLY NOT AGAINST INCREASE IN GASOLINE PRICES BUT WE SHOULD BE CLEAR TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS WHEN YOU'RE GONNA JUST CAPS AGAIN. A RECENT PUBLICATION BY UC DAVIS UC BERKELEY AND STANFORD ECONOMISTS SAID THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET ABOUT FOUR MILLION EXTRA TONS REDUCTION INDUCED PER YEAR. BY CHANGING THE CAPS. AND THAT'S NOT NOTHING BUT IS COMPARED TO THE THIRTY SIX BILLION TONS OF EMISSIONS WORLDWIDE IT IS ALMOST NOTHING. NOW THIS GETS MY POINT UP FINAL POINT. WHICH IS IF WE KEEP MESSING WITH THIS PROGRAM. IT GETS MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE COMPLICATED AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS WILL NOT WANT TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD. CALIFORNIA CANCEL CLIMATE CHANGE ON ITS OWN BECAUSE WE REPRESENT ONLY ONE PERCENT OF GLOBAL EMISSIONS. AND IF WE'RE NOT INSPIRING OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO FOLLOW US THEN THESE EFFORTS WILL BE FOR NOT. AS WE DEBATE THE FINER DE DETAILS OF CAP AND TRADE. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS BUILDING WALLS AND. DISMANTLING OBAMA'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. SO THINK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM MORE INCLUSIVE AND OPEN RATHER THAN MORE ISOLATIONIST. I'M JOHN DONVAN REPRESENTING THE INTERNATIONAL EMISSIONS TRADING ASSOCIATION AND THIS IS MY TESTIMONY. IN. HI AS GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS NEEDED BEFORE THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WE REPRESENT THE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY IN NORTH AMERICA. I LIKE TO BRIEFLY THINK CHAIRMAN ECHOES AND HER STAFF APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING THE DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AS KEY STRATEGIES IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE MEMBERS THREE EXCERPTS FROM THE SCOPING PLAN THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. AT ONE REPLACING FOX A FEW AUTHORED RENEWABLE GAS CAN REDUCE POTENT CHART THE CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND STATE POLICY SHOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. MOVING TOWARDS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WILL HELP CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE ITS TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE TARGET. TWO AS WE LOOK TO REDUCE OVERALL METHANE EMISSIONS WE MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE RECOVERY OF METHANE FROM LANDFILLS LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS AND WE START TREATMENT FACILITIES. AND THREE WE MUST MOVE TOWARD CLEANER FOSSIL R. CLEANER FUELS AND FOR SPACE AND WATER HEATING. WHICH INCLUDES RIVER USING MARIN OVER GAS A VALUABLE INSTANT RESOURCE MADE FROM WASTE PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEIR RESOURCES BOARD AND LEGISLATURE TO. INCREASE THE DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS TO HELP IMPLEMENT DESCRIBING PLAN AND IT'S. VISION OF STATE POLICIES THAT. IS ADVISE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND STATE THINK IF. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS ON MY NAME IS RYAN KENNY WITH CLEAN ENERGY. REALLY NATION'S LARGEST PROVIDER OF RENEWABLE NOW TO GAS TRANSPORTATION FEEL. WE HAVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE AYE STATIONS ALONG HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALSO HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ALL OF OUR FUEL IS MADE FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES I WANTED TO OUR BRAVE A FEW POINTS THAT WILL I'M. BEACH YOU. EVENTUALLY THROUGH THE F. FISCAL IMPACTS. WE WERE VERY SUPPORT OF THE SCOPING PLAN AND HOW THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS IN STRATEGIES IN IT BUT AS YOU KNOW THAT THE DEVIL'S ALWAYS THE DETAILS. AND OUT FOR INSTANCE. THE MOBILE THE MOBILE SOURCE STRATEGY DOCUMENT DOES CALL FOR NINE TWO THOUSAND LOW KNOCKS VEHICLES TO MEET FEDERAL KNOCKS PAYMENT BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY ONE. AND. CENTER SKINNER BROUGHT KNOCKS EARLIER AND. WHILE THAT'S A THE GOAL THAT TODAY AIR BE IN CYCLE TO SHARE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A GAP BETWEEN THE GOAL AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING SO WE DO ENCOURAGE HAVE FURTHER FUNDING. FOR. LOW KNOCKS VEHICLES. GOING FORWARD WITH IN ANY THE JEEZ YOU'RE OFF A FUNDING PLAN FOR THIS YEAR AND SO FORTH. ALSO WITH THE MOBILE SOURCE STRATEGY DOCUMENTED DOES. OFFER TO INCREASE AS YOUR MISSION BUSES AND A RIGHT NOW YOU'RE BE IS AYE AYE GO AND GO AND I'LL FIVE WORKSHOPS THUS FAR. ON THE INTERVIEW THE CLEAN TRANSIT PROGRAM TO AYE MANDATE ZERO EMISSION BUSES. AND. I WILL SPEAK THE TRANSIT INDUSTRY BUT THERE WAS AYE SUBSTANTIAL CONCERN WITHIN THE WORKSHOPS OF THE COSTS AS WELL AS A LACK OF INCENTIVES. AND THAT'S WHERE I YOU'LL COME INTO PLAY OBVIOUSLY FOR POSSIBLY MORE INCENTIVE FUNDING. ZERO EMISSION BUSES COST UP TO FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS LOW NOTS BUSES AND THE ONLY. LESSON ONE PERCENT CLEANER. LOW KNOCKS BUSES OFTENTIMES NINE NINE PERCENT CLEANER THEN I DIESEL. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. WE NEEDED YOU TAKE A LOOK AT HOW IT IMPACT THE LTFS AND A FORCING A TECHNOLOGY. WHICH PICKED WHICH PICKS WINNERS AND LOSERS IN NOT HAVING A PERFORMANCE STANDARDS HIP POINTED TO KNOX WILL IMPACT OTHER PROGRAMS WITHIN THAT THE SCOPING PLAN. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. HI MY NAME IS DAVID WEISKOPF I'M WITH NEXT IN CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. CHAIR NICHOLS IN THE AIR BE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. FOR ALL THE HARD WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS EFFORT SO FAR. WE OF COURSE. IN CALIFORNIA COME FARTHER FASTER THAN ANY ITS JURISDICTION EXCUSE ME THAN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION THAT ATTEMPTED TO. COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE I'D JUST LIKE US TO KEEP IN MIND THAT. NOT ONLY SHOULD WE BE FOCUSING ON WHERE WE'VE COME FROM BUT ALSO WHERE WE NEED TO GET TO WHERE SCIENCE TELLS US WE NEED TO GET TO. AS THE URGENCY OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS CONTINUING TO INCREASE AS WE'RE HAVING UNEXPECTED EVENTS LIKE THE WILD FIRES THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR. WE MUST THINK ABOUT EVERY DECISION NOT JUST LARGE SCALE BUT SMALL SCALE. R. MATTERS WHERE WE HAVE POLICY DISCRETION LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT DISCRETION. AND ASK OURSELVES WHETHER THIS IS HELPING US TO ACCELERATE TO KEEP UP WITH THE INCREASING URGENCY THAT SCIENCE IS TELLING US. OR WHETHER IT'S SLOWING US DOWN MAY THINK THAT PERTAINS TO ISSUES RELATED TO. THE CARBON MARKET DESIGN THE CEILING PRICE. SPEED BUMPS. WHAT TO DO WITH THE OVERHANG ALLOWANCES AND ALSO WHAT TO DO WITH COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES SUCH AS LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD CLEAN CARS INITIATIVES AND SO ON? AND SO I THINK. FOCUSING ON ANY INDIVIDUAL POLICY SAYING THIS AFFECT MAYBE SMALL SMALL RELATIVE TO CALIFORNIA RELATIVE TO GLOBAL. IS. A DANGEROUS PATH TO GO DOWN WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE OVERALL PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION. SHOULD WE BE MAKING CHOICES WITH A VIEW TO ACCELERATING OUR EFFORTS OR WITH A VIEW TOWARDS. KEEPING COSTS LOW. IT POTENTIALLY AT THE RISK OF SLOWING OUR EFFORTS NOW THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JASON VARGAS WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS COUPLE JUST BRIEF COMMENTS ONE. IT'S VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE. CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BANK ALLOWANCES IN THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM. ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY. CLIMATE CHANGE LIMIT. AND. WE AGREE THAT IT'S A AN ISSUE THAT DESERVES. CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND INVESTIGATION AND A POTENTIALLY FURTHER ACTION. TO ENSURE THAT WE REACH OUR STATUTORY. LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY S. B. THIRTY TWO. IN GENERAL VERY SUPPORTIVE THAT'S GOING PLAN WAS ADOPTED A COUPLE THINGS ON HIS FLAG THAT WE RATE IN OUR RECENT COMMENTS TO CARVE. ON THE PLAN ONE. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN STRONGER COMMITMENTS AROUND BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION BUILDING THE CARBONIZATION. I'M CENTER SKINNER BROUGHT IT UP BRIEFLY TODAY AND I THINK THAT'S AN AREA THAT. I MIGHT EVERY COMMITTEES MIGHT BE JUST DIDN'T IN EXPLORING FURTHER. ON AND THEN ON ON VEHICLE EXTRICATION THERE'S OF COURSE A LOT OF THE STATE AND HAS DOING IS COMMITTED TO AND THAT'S EMBODIED IN THE SCOPING PLAN. ONE AREA WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO SING GREATER COMMITMENT WAS ON ELECTRIFICATION OF DRAINAGE TRUCKS. AND AND. COMMITMENT IS SOME TYPE OF REGULATORY ACTION. DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON BONNIE HOMES GEM OF THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA. AND THE LUNG ASSOCIATION OF SUPPORTIVE OF THE SCOPING PLAN IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S. LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE AND THE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN HEALTH AND TO LEAD CLIMB EFFORTS AROUND THE GLOBE. WE'RE VERY PLEASED THIS PLAN INCLUDES A STRONG MULTI POLLUTANT FOCUS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF. ASSEMBLYMEMBERS SAGA EDUARDO AND CHRISTINA GARCIA THANK YOU FOR STRENGTHENING THIS FOCUS THROUGH YOUR LEGISLATION AB WHEN I SEVEN AB. A SIX ONE SEVEN. AS WHAT IS YOUR THREE COMMENTS THAT WE'VE OP SHARED WITH THE BOARD LAST MONTH. BONTA STRENGTH OUR EFFORTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND ONE IS THAT WE WANT TO. TO MOVE FORWARD RAPIDLY TO COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH EVALUATION AS ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE SCOPING PLAN. TO INCLUDE A BROADER ANALYSIS THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS CURRENT DOCUMENT WE APPRECIATE THAT WAS SOME LANGUAGE IN THE RESOLUTION AND THERE'S AN INTENT TO MOVE FORWARD. AND I CONDUCT THIS BROADER HEALTH EVALUATION SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP. WE ALSO SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF STRENGTHENING THE S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE IN THE. A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES COMPONENT OF THE PLAN IS MORE WE CAN DO IN THAT AREA. AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE. A CONTINUED PUSH FOR DEEPER REDUCTIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT TODAY WITH MORE ELECTRIFICATION MORE FOCUS ON LIKE APPLICATION THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR. INCREASE THE ANTE REDUCTION. AND HIGHER CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION TARGETS FOR THE LOW CARBON FEEL CENTERED BEYOND THE TWENTY PERCENT. REDUCTION. THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE PLAN AND WE OF COURSE. SUPPORT CONTINUED FOCUS ON PRIORITIZING DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON AND I'M CAITLIN JENNER CENTER WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE JUST A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS. AND THE FIRST I I REALLY WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS WORKING AND IT'S DOING WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO DO. IT IS THE BACKSTOPS THAT INSURERS CALIFORNIA WILL MEET OUR CLIMATE TARGETS. AND AND IT'S DOING THAT. CARBON EMISSIONS ARE DECREASING AND WERE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE TO MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY TARGET. EVEN WHILE WE'VE SEEN ROBUST ECONOMIC GROWTH. AT THE SAME TIME WE CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THAT MORE CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE TO ADDRESS LOCAL AIR QUALITY AND TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. THROUGH TOOLS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND THE SCOPING PLAN IS ABOUT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND TOOLS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY ISSUES. CAP AND TRADE ISN'T THE ONLY PLAYER. ON THAT TEAM. PROGRAMS LIKE THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD HAVE AN IMPORTANT AND DIFFERENT ROLE TO PLAY ON THAT TEAM IN MEETING OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. AND DECREASING EMISSIONS ESPECIALLY TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. BUT AGAIN WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD DO MORE. ON TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ESPECIALLY IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. AND AND THE LAST POINT I JUST WANTED TO REFERENCE BACK TO CHAIR NICHOLS COMMENT AND AND AND WE AGREE WITH THE ASSESSMENT FROM FROM HER AND FROM CARVE THAT. CAP AND TRADE WILL DRIVE DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND IN FACT WE HAVE SEEN NOW BUT IT IS NOT A DIRECT MEASURE. AND SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION WE THINK IN LIGHT OF AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AND DOESN'T UNDERMINE THE IMPORTANT PURPOSE OF AB ONE NINETY SEVEN. AND SO WE JUST WANTED TO TO ECHO THOSE COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND THE SCOPING PLAN FOR YOUR ANALYSIS AND THANKS FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON JOHN AROUND WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS AYE AYE CONKLIN WHETHER NOT I SHOULD SPEAK BUT. IN TALKING ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE IS IS PUBLIC CENTRAL TO US AS MOST OF OUR MEMBERS WE HAVE TWENTY ONE MEMBERS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO A CAP AND TRADE ITSELF AND HAVE A COMPLAINTS OBLIGATION EACH AND EVERY YEAR. WHEN AB THIRTY TO FIRST START OF THE CAP AND TRADE WAS CONSIDERED A LEAKAGE PREVENTION. PROGRAM. IT WAS DESIGNED TO ALLOW COMPANIES WHO WERE SUBJECT THE CAP AND TRADE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS. IN THE LEAST COST MANNER WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE COULD THEN. INCORPORATE INTO OUR FACILITIES TACTIC THEN NOT HAVE TO BUY THOSE ALLOWANCES AND BECOME MORE EFFICIENT. THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN VERY VERY SLOW AND. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INCREASE THAT IN ORDER TO ALLOW THOSE COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO TO MEET THOSE THOSE OBLIGATIONS. BECAUSE IN THE END. CAP AND TRADE IS NOT AS AS MISTER KHtNG WORDS AND. CAP AND TRADE IS CENTRAL TO THIS AND IT'S THE BIGGEST PART OF OF OUR ENTIRE. GOALS PROCESS HERE HOWEVER IT'S ALSO THE BACKSTOPS. IN FOR ALL THE OTHER COMPLEMENTARY MEASURES YOU SEE AND NOW LIST. ANY OF THEM THAT FAIL TO MEET THEIR REDUCTION GOALS FALLS ON CAP AND TRADE FACILITIES. THAT MEANS IT'S NOT JUST THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT IT COULD BE FORTY PERCENT IT COULD BE FIFTY PERCENT IT COULD BE SIXTY PERCENT COULD BE BIGGER. AND THAT'S GOING TO REALLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BE COMPETITIVE. IF THAT'S THE CASE. SO. I AM URGING RIGHT NOW AS I'VE ALWAYS HAVE IS THAT WE NEED TO REALLY INCREASE. A FUNDING IN. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE. FACILITIES LOCATED IN THE CAP AND TRADE. BY THE WAY ON DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE. ANYTIME A FACILITY LIKE OURS IS ABLE TO RECEIVE MONEY FROM THE CAP AND TRADE AND TO PARLAY THAT INTO A RETROFIT OR A NEW BOILER OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE DIRECT REDUCTION. AND IT'S IN AREAS THAT ARE ARE SUBJECT TO THE IN WHEN VIRAL SCREEN FOR FOR LOW INCOME AREAS SO THERE'S WAYS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO START THINKING IN TERMS OF. OF NOT JUST WHAT CAN WE DO BUT HOW CAN WE DO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FACILITIES CONTINUE TO OPERATE. AND AND THAT WE CAN CONTINUE RECEIVED ARE TO MEET OUR REDUCTION GOALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SPEAK THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BRUCE RAY AND WITH JOHNS MANVILLE. WE'RE BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY COMPANY OF FOCUSING ON THE MANUFACTURE OF. VARIOUS ENERGY EFFICIENCY PRODUCTS INCLUDING INSULATION MANY FORMS OF INSULATION FOR DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS WE HAVE ONE OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN FLAGSHIP MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS ABOUT AN HOUR NORTH OF HERE. IN WILLOW'S SIDE INCLINED COUNTY. WHERE THREE HUNDRED OF OUR EMPLOYEES MAKE? A FIRE GLASS BUILDING INSULATION AND SINCE WE HAD DOESN'T DISCUSSION CONCERNING A LARGE FACILITY EMISSIONS I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THAT. YEARS AGO JOHN SMITH BILL INVESTED IN A VERY. LOW WIND SHEAR LOW CARB AND LOW EMITTING PROCESS. TO MAKE OUR INSULATION AND WHEN WE SWITCHED TO A FORMALDEHYDE FREE. BINDER SOME YEARS AGO WE ALSO REDUCED OUR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS. HAS ITS AIR POLLUTION. EMISSIONS BY NINETY NINE PERCENT. IT IF YOU LOOK AT THE UPDATED SCOPING PLAN. ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS GOING TO BE CALLED UPON TO ACHIEVE AROUND TEN PERCENT OF CUMULATIVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS. AND THAT'S THAT'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN DOUBLE OF WHAT. I THINK THE EVEN FIFTY PERCENT ARE PSS IS I'M GOING TO BE CALLED ON FOR. IF I COULD MAKE A. ONE RECOMMENDATION ON HOW ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE ON THAT PART OF IT AND THAT IS THAT THERE ARE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF UNDER INSULATED HOMES. IN THE STATE MIDI THEM VERY POOR PERFORMERS FROM A AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDPOINT. AND. LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF THEM WILL NEED TO BE RETROFITTED. IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO ACHIEVE ITS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS NOW THERE THERE ARE SOME CAP AND TREATMENT IS THAT EARMARKED FOR WEATHERIZATION BUT IT JUST GOES TO THE EXISTING. LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. IF I GET AGAIN MAKE ONE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION HOPING THAT THE STATE MIGHT CONSIDER. A LITTLE BIT OF AN ALTERNATIVE COURSE IN THIS IS. AYE TO DO A RETROFIT. IT RESIDENTIAL RETROFITS. AND ALONG THE LINES OF. WHAT JOHNS MANVILLE PARTICIPATED IN ENOUGH A BIG PROJECT AND NOW THE COACHELLA VALLEY? A MEMBER GARCIA IN YOUR IN YOUR DISTRICT. ALONG WITH THE US SOUTH COAST OR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. WE PROVIDED BASIC ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS TO A TWENTY ONE HUNDRED HOMES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AREA AND FOCUSED ON THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. DOWN THERE AND WE WERE ABLE TO. QUANTIFY NOT ONLY THE ENERGY SAVINGS BUT ALSO THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND. PARTICULATE TO FINE PARTICULATE EMISSIONS. SO. AND AND THEN ALSO YOU GET THE CO BENEFIT OF INCREASED HEALTH AND SAFETY OF FOR THE. FOR THE HOMEOWNERS AND HOME OCCUPANT SO. AND. AND I I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ACTUALLY INVITE. ANY MEMBERS WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED TO COME UP AND TO OUR FACILITY. I'D SAY IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A FIVE PLUS INSULATION BE MADE ITSELF. IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY MICHAEL BROKERED R. ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION. WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON A FEW OF THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE BY A CHAIR NICHOLS AND THE QUESTIONS FROM. SENATOR SKINNER AND OTHER COMMENTS EARLIER FROM A COUPLE OF WITNESSES ON RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION AND DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE SCANNERS QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF NATURAL GAS BEING USED IN THE STATE PARTICULARLY IN OUR HOMES FOR HEATING. FOR. OTHER PURPOSES I WATER HEATERS AND OTHERS THAT'S GONNA NEED TO BE PART OF THE STRATEGY. THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE GOING TO TRY AND CONVINCE YOU THIS YEAR THAT YOU CAN REPLACE ALL THAT WITH A. RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AS A REPLACEMENT FEEL IT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT TRUE IT WAS CONSIDERED BY AIR BE A FIVE PERCENT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS STANDARD. BUT WASN'T. SPOKEN OF EARLIER IN TERMS OF. SOME OF THE FINDINGS OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WAS THE COST OF THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA. FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TON OF EMISSIONS REDUCTION. THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCOPING PLAN AND WHY ITS NOT A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE STATE WE CAN'T AFFORD RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN THE FOOD PROCESSORS THAT REPRESENT. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME THAT ONE OF FORCE THAT UPON US SO BE VERY CAUTIOUS AS WE HAVE THIS DEBATE AND WE TALK ABOUT RENEWABLE GAS. WHAT DOES MAKE SENSE IS THAT WE CAPTURE RENEWABLE GAS? FROM LANDFILLS FROM WASTE WATER AGENCIES IN FROM DAIRIES BECAUSE THAT MAKES A TON OF SENSE THAT'S FUGITIVE METHANE. WE NEED TO CAPTURE THAT PUT THAT TO USE PROBABLY MOSTLY AS TRANSPORTATION FEE ON THE STATE. MAKES A TON A SENSE WHAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IS GOING BEYOND THAT AND THAT'S WHERE THERE ARE SOME FOLKS THAT WANNA STAY AHEAD IN THE STATE. AND I JUST WANT TO WARN YOU BE WARY BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION THINK. HI TIME TO KILL SO VILE HERE WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENT ACCOUNT BALANCE. JUST WANTED A. SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS FOR ALL THESE COMMITTEE HEARING. HOPEFULLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEARS THROUGH THESE HEARINGS AND THROUGH OTHER STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS THAT THERE BE A. SOME OF THE. COME MORE TECHNICAL ISSUES ARE ARE CLARIFIED FOR THE PUBLIC WE SPUR STILL SING A LOT THAT WE SIDE TODAY. I'M WERE JUMPING IN AND OUT OF OF POLICIES AND BACK AND FORTH THROUGH TIME LINES AND AND CREATING A AN UNCLEAR PICTURE THAT THAT THE PUBLIC. AND EVEN SOME COMPLIANCE ENTITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS CAN'T CLARIFY ON THEIR OWN I THINK CHAIR NICHOLS DID A GOOD JOB AT. THAT CREATING SOME CLARITY AND DEFINITION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE THAT IT IT IS IMPORTANT BE FAIRLY PRECISE IN YOUR LANGUAGE. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAP AND TRADE CAP VERSES THE SCOPING PLANNED CAPPER THE S. B. THIRTY TWO GOALS THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT THINGS YES THEY'RE WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME AND BUT BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT PIECES OF A PUZZLE. I'M ALSO LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL JURISDICTIONS THAT THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF LONG STANDING. HISTORY AND HOW THOSE LINES ARE DRAWN AND HOW THOSE THINGS WORK IN AND YOU KNOW AS WE. EXAMINE THESE THINGS THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO TO SEE IF THOSE LINES ARE THE LINES SHOULD BE DRAWN OR IF THEY'RE WORKING AS PROPERLY. AS I THINK SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD MAYBE THAT THESE LINES ARE BLURRED AND I NEED TO BE CLARIFIED IT MAYBE LINES ARE DRAWN IN THE WRONG SPOT. AND I HOPE THAT THAT WE CAN KIND OF KEEP. YOU KNOW THE FOCUS ON ON WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT EACH AND EVERY MOMENT SO. WILL PROBABLY FOLLOW UP WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE BUT WE APPRECIATE THAT HAPPENS LIKE. HELLO VALERIE TRAIL OF BLACK HOSE SPECIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY I'M ALSO WANNA THINK THOUGH THE CHAIRS IN THE IN THE COMMITTEES FOR HOLDING THIS I'M HEARING TODAY. AND. JUST WHERE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS OF WE HEARD FROM OUR WITH THE WITNESSES TODAY THAT THERE IS A DELICATE BALANCE. TO BE STRUCK. BETWEEN OUR CARBON ALLOWANCE PRICES. AND THAT THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO DRIVE THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE NEED AND THE BUSINESS DECISIONS. THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE AND PRICES THAT CAN. GET SOHIGH THAT THEY THREATEN OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY AND YOU HEARD THIS ALL LAST YEAR. IN THE YOU KNOW AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. DEBATE AND P. GINNY'S COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THAT THROUGH ALL OF THE ANALYSIS AND. STUDIES THAT THE SCOPING PLAN DOES A GREAT JOB AND BALANCE MAKING DOING THIS BALANCING ACT. SO. WE JUST WANTED TO. AND THAT'S WITH OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS AND EXPERTS EXCEPT TRACK SO. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ECHO A COMMENT MADE BY A. PREVIOUS AYE WITNESS HERE AND PUBLIC COMMENT THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE WHY CAP. IS FIRM. AND SIGNIFICANTLY STRICT WITH A GETS VERY AGGRESSIVE TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL ON EVEN IF BANKING ALLOWS ENTITIES. TO EXCEED. THAT CAP IN A GIVEN YEAR THE CAP IS UP STATEWIDE AND NOT ON INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES OR INDUSTRIES. THAT'S THE ELEGANCE OF ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND FINALLY I JUST WANNA KNOW THAT P. GENIE IS COMMITTED TO D. CARBON AYE SAYING. IT'S NATURAL GAS SYSTEM AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND WORKING WITH. ACT HARD AS WE IMPLEMENT AB THREE NINETY EIGHT AND THE PRICE CAP. AB PROCEEDINGS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE THIS YEAR IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER THINK YOU. THAT AFTERNOON MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE TIM CARMICHAEL WAS SEPARATE UTILITIES AS THE PARENT COMPANY OF US ANY GOOD GAS ELECTRIC AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY. ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT OF VALOR TRAILER JUST MADE ON BEHALF OF P. GENIE BUT I WON AT THREE POINTS. ONE. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ADOPTED MAJOR CHANGES TO THEIR A CLIMATE STRATEGY IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH A LOT OF INPUT FROM THE LEGISLATURE. IT'S A LOAN IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THAT PLAN IS NOT STATIC IT'S NOT LOCKED IN FOR LIFE. THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THAT IT BE UPDATED AT LEAST EVERY FIVE YEARS AND. WE. ARE LEARNING EVERY YEAR WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING THE ENHANCEMENTS THAT CAME FROM LEGISLATION LAST YEAR ABOUT ADDITIONAL. ON MONITORING REQUIREMENTS ARE GONNA MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE GOING FORWARD AND INFORMING WHAT STRATEGIES ARE ARE AFFECTED AND WHAT WHICH ONES WE NEED TO IMPROVE. WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PLAN THAT'S IN AND PLACE. SECOND POINT. RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MR BROKEN DOORS COMMENTS WE AGREE ABSOLUTELY ON THE NEED TO CAPTURE FUGITIVE METHANE IN THE STATE AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. WHERE WE DISAGREE IS THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE LOW CARB JUST IN OUR PROGRAM IS ENOUGH TO INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE NEED TO SEE IN CALIFORNIA RELATED TO NO ONE NATURAL GAS? SO WE ARE GOING TO BE ADVOCATING FOR THE ADDITIONAL EFFORTS. TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF RENEWABLE GAS IN CALIFORNIA AND LET'S HAVE A HEALTHY DEBATE ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE THE WE NEED MORE THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE. AND THAT'S ON SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LEVEL THE DEVELOPMENT. WITH NOBLE GAS PROJECTS IN THE STATE THAT WE ALL THOUGHT WE WOULD BY NOW. AND FINALLY A ON YOUR POINT AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER KRISTIN GARCIA ABOUT YOUR DISTRICT IT AND IT'S IN FACT THIS REPRESENT OF MANY DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. WHERE IT TURNS OUT TRANSPORTATION SOURCES ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM? NOT ONLY FOR GHG EMISSIONS BUT FOR THE SMOG FORMING A TOXIC EMISSIONS. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE. SEEN GREAT PROGRESS IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ON WITH ELECTRIC PASSENGER VEHICLES WITH A HYBRID VEHICLES AND. WITH A NEAR ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES ON THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. JUST IN LAST COUPLE WEEKS CERTIFIED A NEAR ZERO EMISSION ENGINE FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. THAT WAS IN MY MIND A MISSING LINK IN OUR BROAD STRATEGY TRANSPORTATION EMISSION REDUCTION STRATEGY THAT WE NOW HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TOOL. THAT WE CAN INCENTIVIZE IN USE TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROBLEMS ON THE ROAD WHICH. WHICH CAN BE THE EMISSIONS OF HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS.
