MR IT'S NOT A QUESTION FOR MR

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:57.949
PADDOCK WELL WE'VE GOT YOU HERE.

00:31:58.016 --> 00:31:59.017
THE STATE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:01.419
US TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET SO

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:04.455
THIS IS THE- AGREEMENT BETWEEN

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:05.857
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:32:05.923 --> 00:32:09.827
GOVERNOR AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING

00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:10.328
TO BALANCE REVENUES WITH

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:11.529
EXPENSE YOURS BUT WONDERING

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:13.498
ABOUT YOUR OPINION OF WHETHER

00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:14.299
NOT. BALANCE GIVEN THE FACT

00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:17.535
THAT SO MUCH ON DEFERRALS ON

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.770
LOANSKNOWN INTER FUND

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:21.139
TRANSFERS TO ACHIEVE- THAT THAT

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:25.877
EQUILIBRIUM. BUT YES MISTER

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:28.713
OBERNOLTE- WELL I WOULD JUST

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.815
SAY UP FRONT THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:33.117
A GREAT DEAL OF INSIGHT ABOUT

00:32:33.184 --> 00:32:34.919
SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT GO

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:38.289
INTO THE PACKAGE- BUT- USE OF

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:41.125
DEFERRALS AND INTER FUND LOANS

00:32:41.192 --> 00:32:44.195
ARE. A SOURCE AT ONE TIME

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:47.231
RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE-

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:49.334
KICKSTAND THEY'RE SUFFICIENT TO

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.436
SUPPORT THE BUDGET YOU'RE

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:52.704
EXPENDITURES THEY COULD

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.773
CONSIDER. AS CONTRIBUTING TO

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.510
BUDGETARY BALANCE. SO YOU'RE

00:32:59.577 --> 00:33:01.245
SAYING THAT YOU THINK THAT

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:04.282
THAT'S A PERMISSIBLE USE OF

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:06.017
THOSE FUNDS TAT WE CAN POINT

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:07.485
AT THIS BUDGET AND SAY THIS IS

00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:10.221
A BALANCED. PERMISSIBLE IT DOES

00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:12.457
TO SOME EXTENT YOUR RISK

00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:15.460
TOLERANCE AND TO THE EXTENT

00:33:15.526 --> 00:33:18.429
THAT THE ECONOMY DOES NOT

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:20.832
CONTINUE IN A RECOVERY MODE AND

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:23.534
IF THE IF THE RECOVERY BEGAN TO

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:25.370
ALTER OVER THE COURSE OF THE

00:33:25.436 --> 00:33:28.072
COMING. THEN I THINK THE LATER

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:31.342
WOULD BE FACED WITH MAKING MORE

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:35.313
AND DEEPER- ONGOING ADJUSTMENTS

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.448
TO THE EXPENDITURE BASE- NEXT

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:40.084
YEAR SO TO SOME EXTENT YOU KNOW

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:41.919
THERE'S A CHOICE THAT YOU'RE

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:46.290
MAKING BY USING A ONE TIME

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.291
RESOURCES DISH THERE. WEST OF

00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:48.526
THEM WERE BORN WE YEARS IF THEY

00:33:48.593 --> 00:33:51.396
WOULD BE NAY. I CERTAINLY SHARE

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:53.631
YOUR AND I ALSO HAVE AN

00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:54.766
ADDITIONAL CONCERN WHICH IS

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:56.067
THAT. I BELIEVE THAT THE

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:58.369
PURPOSE OF THE PROVISION OUR

00:33:58.436 --> 00:33:59.704
STATE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES A

A RECESSION THAT POWER THE

CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE AND I

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:09.680

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.626
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND THAT

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.427
THE INTENSE LANGUAGE THAT'S

00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:46.029

AT BEFORE THE ENROLLMENT

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.368

ABOUT CLOSING A STATE PRISON-

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:12.641

WERE HAVING THAT DISCUSSION IN

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:15.511
THE CONTEXT OF TALKING ABOUT

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:16.645
THE BUDGET BUT THE THINGS THAT

PRICE PAROLE. AUTHORIZING

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:30.426
MISDEMEANOR DIVERT OVER OVER

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:31.694
THE OBJECTION OF PROSECUTORS

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.329
EXPANDING THE EARLY RELEASE OF

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.830
CRIMINALS FROM STATE PRISONS

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.333
HOW HOW ARE THOSE- OF FISCAL

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:40.703

BILLS TO SEE PROCESS. YES

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:47.776
MISTER OBERNOLTE UNDERSTAND

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:48.944
THAT THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.980
OF OPINION ON THIS- BUT FROM

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:51.480
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:53.148
ADMINISTRATION WOULD YOU

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:55.317
BELIEVE THAT THESE- IMPLEMENT

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:56.852
THE BUDGET BELT- THEY ARE VERY

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:57.953

PART OF THE OVERALL FISCAL PLAN

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.559
AND WE BELIEVE IN MANY IF NOT

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:05.628
MOST OF THESE CASES OF THESE

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:06.662
PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:08.497
AND DEBATED OVER THE LAST

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.999
SEVERAL MONTHS- SO WE DO

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.600

SIDES OF THESE ISSUES HAVE

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.441
CONCERNS ABOUT THAT THE REASON

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:21.076
WHY WE HAVE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:22.578
IS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:24.446
DEBATES IN A PUBLIC FORUM. AND

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:25.314

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:58.273
TO THE AT THE LEGISLATION

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:01.677
DOCTORS REQUIRE- JUDICIAL-

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.279
DISCRETION AND REVIEW- AND SO

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:06.381
IT WAS ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IN

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:07.282
WHICH THEY JUDGE. HAD A

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.418
QUESTION OF WHETHER IT WAS A

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:12.588
PRO. YEAH BUT SOMEONE IN ONE OF

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:14.456
THE- HAVE IS THAT RIGHT. INTO

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:19.128
THE JUDGE COULD CERTAINLY BLOCK

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:21.130
THAT FROM. WELL YOU SAID

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.164
POTENTIALLY YOU IS THERE SO

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:22.765
THAT THAT'S WHEN THINGS THAT

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.366
WERE THE IS LEGISLATION WE'RE-

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:25.734
IT'S BEEN WRITTEN AND YOU HAVE

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:29.138
OF- APPLYING DONE IT SO. I HAVE

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.173
ISSUE WITH POTENTIALLY SO

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.207
EITHER IT IS OR ISN'T SUMMIT

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:33.909
TAKE THAT AS THEY ARE ELIGIBLE

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:37.312
CORRECT. THEY ARE ALL BOATS

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:39.181
PRACTICE IN AND WHAT'S THE

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.315
REASON BEHIND THAT AND I'LL PUT

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.184
TO SOMETHING WHEN DURING COLD

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.153
IN NINETEEN- THE SUPREME COURT

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.221
WAY THEN SAID WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:47.856
NO BILL TO REDUCE POPULATIONS

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.958
FROM OUR JAILS AND- PRISONS.

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:51.827
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT CLOSELY.

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.562
THE SAME CHARGES THE SUPREME

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:57.699
COURT EXCLUDED. SO I MEAN THE I

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:58.534
THINK THEY SAW THE POTENTIAL

01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.868
SOLVE THE ISSUES WITH IT AND

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.804
SOME THE PUBLIC OUTCRY SO THE

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:03.272
CHANGE FROM A LOST ANY POSITION

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:05.440
OF INCLUDING EVERYBODY AND- TO

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:07.109
EXEMPTING THESE FOLKS FROM

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:09.812
THIS. SO I'M TRYING TO

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:11.280
RATIONALIZE THAT AND CORRELATE

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:16.418
THE TWO. SURE SO AGAIN I. CAN'T

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.086
SPEAK FOR THE FOUGHT CROPPED UP

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:20.055
OF THE LEGISLATURE. THIS IS THE

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.557
SENATE PROPOSAL ON SO I DON'T

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:22.658
KNOW ALL OF THE- THOUGHT

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:24.359
PROCESS THAT WENT BEHIND IT BUT

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:26.562
I WOULD SAY. AGAIN THAT YOU

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:27.429
KNOW IN THOSE PARTICULAR

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:28.997
CATEGORIES THE DESCRIBING THE

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:30.532
JUDGE DOES HAVE THE DISCRETION

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:32.100
TO. PREVENT SOMEONE FROM

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:34.970
ENTERING INTO THIS PROGRAM. I

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:35.537
THINK THE BROADER RATIONALE.

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.206
GETTING THE DIVERSION PROGRAM

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:41.577
TO YOUR LEFT IS THAT. IT IS. IT

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:42.744
AN ATTEMPT TO SORT OF BREAK

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:44.680
BREAK THIS CYCLE OF CRIME- AND

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:46.381
ALLOW FOR THE DELIVERY OF

01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:47.516
SERVICES OF REHABILITATIVE

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:49.818
PROGRAMS TO INDIVIDUALS.

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:52.754

ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES THEY

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:56.859
NEED TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON

01:14:56.925 --> 01:15:00.162
TRACK. CREATE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:02.297
REHABILITATE TOPS AND SO I

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:04.099
THINK THAT THAT WATER RATIONALE

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:07.069
FOR. CREATING THE PROGRAM TO BE.

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:08.604
THE BOTTOM LINE ADMINISTRATION

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.539
SUPPORTS IT SO THE SENATE MAY

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:13.342
HAVE. MANUFACTURED WELL WITH

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:14.209

MARKER FOR THAT AND THAT ALWAYS

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:54.536
GOES TO THE SECRETARY FOR

01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:55.904

01:18:04.379 --> 01:18:06.748
PARTICULARLY VALUABLE- GIVEN

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.316
THAT ULTIMATELY THE COURT THAT

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:09.384

BEEN AFFECTED WITH THAT SO I'M

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:25.200
IF THIS REASON IF THAT WAS TO

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:27.002
BE A BETTER PROCESS WITH THAT I

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:30.038

PUBLIC SAFETY IS THE PUBLIC

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:37.479
SAFETY IS ASSURED AND I THINK

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:41.216
BY HAVING POWER MANY DAYS THIS

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:44.352

EXCLUDE THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:09.951
IT IS THAT THE RATIONALE. FOR

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:13.521
THE SOLE POLICY. IT TOO TO NOT-

THIS IS PART OF A BROADER SHIFT

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:29.871
I THINK WE ARE SEEING IN THE

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:32.173
CONVERSATION IN THIS AREA- THAT

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.609
PART OF REHABILITATION- IS

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.211
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:38.146

DISPROPORTIONATELY TREATED

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:47.689
BASED ON SOMETHING THAT THEY

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:49.224
MAY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST SO AS

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:51.526
YOU NOTED- THIS DOESN'T BAR THE

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:53.027
CONSIDERATION OF BACKING ATION

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:56.331
BUT- WE HOPE THAT IT ENCOURAGES

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:58.433
INSTITUTIONS- TO FOR ABOUT.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.034
REST OF A PERSON'S RECORD-

01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:02.003
BEFORE INCLUDING THAT OTHER ACT

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.037
FROM THE BACKGROUND BUT HERE

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:05.006
SHE MAY HAVE SO JUST TO MAKE US

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:06.741
MORE COMFORTABLE BEFORE THERE'S

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:08.843
AN ACTUAL ROLE MEANT IF IT SO I

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:11.012
FOUND OUT THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:15.216
DIDN'T ANSWER YET L. CATION

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:16.651
CODE IS NOT. HAS THAT HIS OF

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.953
SERIOUS TO MASS VIOLENCE

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:19.554
ASSAULT AND BATTERY WOULD HAVE

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.790
YOU. THAT'S THE TIME WHERE THE

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:23.525
INSTITUTION WOULD WOULD MOST

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:26.895
LIKELY. DID DENY THE INDIVIDUAL

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:29.197
FROM FROM PROCEEDING WITH THE-

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:31.766
EDUCATION PROGRAM SEKARANG.

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.034
THEY WOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:34.602
TED TO MAKE A DECISION THERE

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:35.970
YEAH WELL IS THAT THE INTENT

01:24:36.037 --> 01:24:37.205
THAT YOU WOULD BE THAT THERE

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:39.841
WOULD BE- THAT WE WOULD WAIT

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:40.975
OUT IN THE INSTITUTIONS OF WEED

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.744
OUT INDIVIDUALS. CANCERS THAT

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:45.547
TIME. I SAID THAT ESPECIALLY IN

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:46.714
THE CASES WHERE THIS IS

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:47.582
APPLYING TO PRIVATE

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:50.051
POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS- I

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:51.653
DON'T THINK THE STATE IS IN A

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:54.756
POSITION TO DETERMINE- WHICH-

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:56.791
WHICH PARTS OF A PERSON'S

01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:57.325
CRIMINAL HISTORY SHOULD BE

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.627
DISQUALIFIED. VERSUS NOT AT YOU

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:01.696
EVEN THAT YOU CAN SEE VERY

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:02.764
SCENARIOS IT'S ALL BASED ON

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:05.200
CONTACT- BUT TO YOUR POINT THAT

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:06.968
INSTITUTION WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:09.437
DECIDE FOR ITSELF IN MAKING THE

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:11.406
WRONG DECISION. WHICH FACTORS-

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:13.875
TO WHITE. SO THIS IS FOR ALL

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.477
I'M I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED NO

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:18.279
THIS IS NOT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:20.114
TRAINING PROGRAMS IT'S FOR. ALL

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:22.550
HIGHER EDUCATION ENROLLMENT I

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:24.085
SHOULD CLARIFY NAMED CHRIS CAN

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:25.587
WEIGH IN A IT APPLIES TO A

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:26.588
NUMBER OF POST SECONDARY

01:25:26.654 --> 01:25:28.156
INSTITUTIONS- BUT WITH

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:29.958
EXCEPTIONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:32.060
TRAINING THERE ALSO EXCEPTIONS

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:33.962
RELATED TO PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:35.730
SUCH AS IN A LAW SCHOOL THESE

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.632
ARE GOVERNED BY THEIR OWN SET

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:38.833
OF STANDARDS AND THEYHAVE OWN

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.502
GUIDELINES BUT LET ME TURN IT

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:43.104
OVER TO CHRIS TO DESCRIBE THAT

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:45.006
THE DIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS. BUT

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:46.508
CERTAINLY IF YOU DON'T APPLY TO

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.843
ALL OF THE STATE. INSTITUTIONS

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:49.878
WHETHER THEY'RE PUBLIC OR

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:51.913
PRIVATE- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.681
WITH UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:55.283
SPECIFICALLY. AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:56.618
OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:57.986
UNIVERSITY AND CALIFORNIA

01:25:58.052 --> 01:26:00.154
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. A LARGELY

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:02.357
DO NOT AFFECT QUESTION ON THEIR

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:03.958
ADMISSIONS APPLICATIONS TODAY.

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:05.360
SO THERE THERE IS NO IMPACT ON

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:08.897
THAT SIDE OF THE EQUATION. FOR

01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:10.164
UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS I

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:12.267
THINK THAT THE THIRD STILL USE

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.468
OF A COMMON APPLICATION AND

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:14.936
MANY PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THAT

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.437
DON'T HAVE THAT QUESTION ON

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.339
THAT- IN BOTH INSTITUTIONS

01:26:18.406 --> 01:26:20.408
WOULD HAVE ONE YEAR TO. ALTER

01:26:20.475 --> 01:26:21.543
THEIR PROCESS AND THEIR

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:23.177
APPLICATION TO NOT CONSIDER

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:24.612
THAT AS PART OF THE NATION'S

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:25.980
BUT CERTAINLY THEY CAN DO THAT

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:28.116
AS PART OF ENROLLMENT. BUT THE

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:29.851
SORT OF LARGER- DISCUSSION THAT

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:31.753
WE'VE HEARD. IS MOST OF THE

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:33.521
INSTITUTIONS ARE TRYING TO

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:34.622
ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:36.658
ENTERING A PROGRAM THROUGH

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:38.560
WHICH THEY CAN'T OBTAIN LICENSE

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:40.562
FOR AT THE END- AND I THINK ON

01:26:40.628 --> 01:26:42.163
THE FRONT AND SORT OF THE

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:43.731
RATIONALE THAT WE'VE HEARD. YES

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:46.034
IT IS- LIMITING A CYCLE COMPARE

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.203
YOUR TO STUDENTS WHO ARE IN

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:50.872
THAT SITUATION THEY BEGIN A

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.974
CAJUN TO. SEEK ADMITTANCE TO AN

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:54.709
INSTITUTION- BUT THEY THEY

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:58.146
STOP. A PAST THAT QUESTION AND

01:26:58.212 --> 01:26:59.113
THEY FAILED TO COMPLETE THEIR

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:02.183
APPLICATION- FOR CONSIDERATION

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.384
TO THE INSTITUTION I THINK

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:05.219
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS

01:27:05.286 --> 01:27:05.787
LANGUAGE IS FOCUSED ON THE-

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:08.189
SHORTER MOVE MATT BEAR KIRK ON

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:10.992
THE FRONT END OF APPLYING BUT

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.727
STILL UNABLE. TO JUSHIN TO MAKE

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:13.461
SURE. THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHO

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:19.734
BE ABLE TO. IN ANY PROFESSIONAL

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:21.102

IT'S UP TO A JUDGE'S DISCRETION

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:20.328
THAT AS A HUMAN BEING YOU'RE

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:21.762

STAND FOR THE STANFORD RATE

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:29.470

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:56.230
IN THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM- THE

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:57.898

ABOUT TWENTY THREE MILLION

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:17.117

FOUR- ADVOCATING TDK ARE MUCH

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:25.793
MUCH OF THEIR COSTS ARE DRIVEN

01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:27.194
BY THE POPULATION THAT ARE

01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:29.363

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:37.471
COMMUNITY SO HERE AS WE- AT

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:38.238
SHRINK THE PAROLE. TO ME. UP

01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:39.540
WITH THAT MùT PEOPLE ARE SO

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:40.641
TO BE IN THE YEAR THIS DOES

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:42.142
GENERATE I'M QUITE A BIT A

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:43.777
GENERAL FUND PAVING. AND THEN

01:39:43.844 --> 01:39:44.978
THE EXPANSION OF ELDERLY

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:48.349
PAROLE- WE EXPECT TO GENERATE-

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:49.817
SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THE NET

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.452
NEIGHBORHOOD OF HUNDREDS OF

01:39:51.518 --> 01:39:52.519
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:54.488
POTENTIALLY GOING TO MILLION.

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:56.457
IN THE OUT YEARS- AS YOU

01:39:56.523 --> 01:39:58.559
COMPARE THE COURT THE COST OF

01:39:58.625 --> 01:39:59.159
THE NATIONAL SUITABILITY

01:39:59.226 --> 01:40:01.895
HEARINGS VERSUS THOSE RELEASED-

01:40:01.962 --> 01:40:03.931
BUT AGAIN THAT THAT THE GENERAL

01:40:03.997 --> 01:40:06.033
FUND SAVING AND AN AREA WHERE.

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:07.668
THE PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE A

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:11.372
REALLY LOW RECIDIVISM LEVEL.

01:40:11.438 --> 01:40:13.173
THANK YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU ALSO

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.109
ADDRESS FOR COST SAVINGS.

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:16.577
THROUGH THE MISDEMEANOR

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:21.915
DIVERSION POLICY AS WELL. TO OR

01:40:21.982 --> 01:40:26.520
ANY POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS.

01:40:26.587 --> 01:40:27.488
THERE ARE NOT WORDS IN TERMS OF

01:40:27.554 --> 01:40:29.289
THE COST SAVINGS UP WE HAVEN'T

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:30.557
SCORED ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY

01:40:30.624 --> 01:40:33.594
AND THE BUDGET- I THINK THE

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.763
THERE ARE POTENTIAL. SAVINGS

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:36.964
DOWN THE LINE TO THE EXTENT

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:38.899
THAT- A LOT OF TIMES WHAT WE

01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:40.467
SEE IS PEOPLE WHO CYCLE THROUGH

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:43.604
MISDEMEANOR OFFENSIVE- AND

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:45.305
SOMETIMES LOWER LEVEL OFFENSIVE

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:47.541
DO AT SOME POINT TO PROGRESS TO

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:49.576
THE POINT WHERE DID YOU COMMIT

01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:50.944
MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES THEY

01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:52.646
DON'T GET. REHABILITATIVE

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:57.084
SERVICES AND SO- I THINK IF TO

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:58.185
THE EXTENT INDIVIDUALS GO INTO

01:40:58.252 --> 01:41:01.155
THESE PROGRAMS ARE ABLE TO- GET

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:02.556
REHABILITATIVE SERVICES AND

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:04.858
REDUCE RECIDIVISM THERE COULD

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:07.261
BE SOME DOWNSTREAM SAVINGS- IN

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:10.030
TERMS OF. FUTURE REDUCTION

01:41:10.097 --> 01:41:13.400
FUTURE PRESENT COMMITMENTS- BUT

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:14.701
THAT IS. SOMEWHAT BACK WHAT IS

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:16.103
IT SO WE HAVE AN SCHOOL

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:17.471
ANYTHING IN THE BY SHOULD THAT

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:19.006
OCCUR IT WOULD GET PICKED

01:41:19.072 --> 01:41:20.674
PICKED UP AT SEVEN LATER WHEN

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:24.344
WE DO OUR ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS-

01:41:24.411 --> 01:41:26.180
BASED ON THE PRISON POPULATION.

01:41:26.246 --> 01:41:28.081
OKAY THANK THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:29.850
COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:32.219
COMMITTEE TALKED WEBER. I WANT

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:34.254
TO- FIRST WHAT I'M AND I

01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:35.456
APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:37.724
THAT STAFF IS DONE AND I THINK-

01:41:37.791 --> 01:41:39.259
SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT THESE-

01:41:39.326 --> 01:41:42.296
PROPOSALS AND UNFORTUNATELY-

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:43.430
DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS WE HAD

01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:45.265
WE HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:46.600
TO HAVE MUCH DISCUSSION IN THE

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:49.670
UNIVERSE OF COMMITTEES ON THESE

01:41:49.736 --> 01:41:50.170
ISSUES AND SO THAT'S THE

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:50.771
IMPORTANT PIECE. I KIND OF

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:52.439
UNDERSTAND MOST OF IT BECAUSE

01:41:52.506 --> 01:41:54.475
OF THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:56.343
HAVE BEEN STE RECYCLED THROUGH

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.679
THE HOUSE AT SOME POINT IN SOME

01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:00.180
PROXY OR SOME BUILD UP THERE

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:02.115
BUT- IT'S UNFORTUNATE NOT HAD

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:04.685
ENOUGH NEEDED MORE DISCUSSION

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.720
ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE HEAR

01:42:06.787 --> 01:42:08.188
IN THIS PACKAGE TO. IT DOESN'T

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:09.189
WITH THAT'S BEEN BREACHED BY

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:11.425
THE THREE D. SO IT'S DIFFICULT

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:13.393
TO SAY- I UNDERSTAND AND THE

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.562
BOX ANDI THINK IT IS IMPORTANT.

01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:16.597
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND I THINK

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:18.398
SOMETIMES WE GET CONCERNED BUT

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:20.234
THE REALITY IS IT DOES EXIST IN

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.602
OUR BIG SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:23.337
THE UC'S IN THE C. ISSUES DON'T

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:25.439
ASK THESE QUESTIONS AND THE N.

01:42:25.506 --> 01:42:27.241
AS HAVING BEEN A PROFESSOR I'VE

01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:31.612
HAD A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:42:31.678 --> 01:42:32.212
ACTS OF IS IN CLASSES WORKING

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:34.014
ON A GREAT DEGREE. AND I'VE IN

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:35.816
CURRENT THEY WILL IMPROVE THE

01:42:35.883 --> 01:42:39.086
THAT THEY WANTED TO DO BETTER

01:42:39.152 --> 01:42:39.920
BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EASY THING

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:40.988
TO FOR SEE. AND GO THROUGH ALL

01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:43.257
THAT WORKING HARD WORK IS THERE

01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:44.758
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM DON'T

01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:45.359
QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL

01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:46.960
AID AND ON AND ON AND ON AND SO

01:42:47.027 --> 01:42:53.667
IT'S BILLION CARDS WHEN. WHEN I

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:54.635
THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE. GONNA

01:42:54.701 --> 01:42:55.202
THE WRONG PATH AND COME BACK

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:56.069
AND NOW THEY HAVE TO UNIVERSE.

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:56.703
EARNING DEGREES AND SOME OF MY

01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:58.472
STE. AND NOW. TO A ONCE IN.

01:42:58.539 --> 01:43:00.774
WERE PROFESSOR AND HAD. A REAL

01:43:00.841 --> 01:43:02.109
CHALLENGES WHEN THEY WERE

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:03.377
EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN YEARS OLD

01:43:03.443 --> 01:43:04.545
AND A FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS IN

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:06.446
PRISON. AND COME BACK AND

01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:07.514
DECIDE TO GO TO THE IN THE

01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:08.515
FAMILY THAT ARE GOING TO

01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:10.751
REBUILD A LIFE. DONE IT. AND

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:11.552
OUR REAL CREDIT TO THE

01:43:11.618 --> 01:43:12.619
COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WORK

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:14.288
IN. A SOCIAL WORKERS AND

01:43:14.354 --> 01:43:15.656
BUSINESS OWNERS AND WHAT HAVE

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.691
YOU SO. IT IS IT IT YOU KNOW I

01:43:17.758 --> 01:43:18.926
THINK YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:43:18.992 --> 01:43:19.693
REHABILITATION WE HAVE TO TALK

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.995
ABOUT ALL. AND I THINK. ONE OF

01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:22.696
OUR KIDS WHO'VE BEEN

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:24.097
STREAMLINED COME I DON'T FIRST

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:26.066
WOULD BE HAPPY. WE HATE TO HAVE

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:28.735
THE NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:30.237
ATTEND UNIVERSITY BECAUSE- THEY

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:34.641
HAD A PRIOR. BETTER SO ARE YOU

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:36.176
KNOW THAT'S IMPORTANT INVESTED

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:36.743
AT TO ALWAYS REMEMBER BE. WE

01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:37.411
SAY WE BELIEVE IN THE ABILITY.

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:39.746
AND SOMETIMES UP. WE LOOK AT IT

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:41.114
ONE WAY BUT THEN. YOU KNOW YOU

01:43:41.181 --> 01:43:42.616
HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND REALITY

01:43:42.683 --> 01:43:43.817
IN. TERMS OF WHAT WE REALLY

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.619
GOING. TO HELP YOU KNOW PEOPLE

01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:46.787
WHO'VE BEEN GONE ASTRAY.

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:48.088
BASICALLY REBUILD THEIR LIVES

01:43:48.155 --> 01:43:49.690
IS GOING TO TAKE SOME WORK. AND

01:43:49.756 --> 01:43:50.924
SOMETIMES IT TAKES OF SUCCESS

01:43:50.991 --> 01:43:52.426
AND FAILURE STORY ASKING TAT.

01:43:52.492 --> 01:43:54.227
OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BUT PEOPLE

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:56.196
STILL GET UP. AND STILL REPEAL

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:57.197
THE LICENSE I THINK THAT'S

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:59.132
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I THINK IT

01:43:59.199 --> 01:44:01.301
IS REALLY- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:02.469
THINGS I THINK THAT WE HAVE

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:04.304
CONSTANTLY SAID WHAT. BOTH OF

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.472
THE CYCLE BECAUSE WITH YOU LOOK

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:06.974
AT. WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH US

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.810
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OVER.

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:10.844
NUMBER PRISONS AND ALL KINDS OF

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:12.279
THINGS. WE KEEP SAYING WE NEED

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:13.981
A BETTER WAY TO ASSESS PEOPLE.

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:15.248
BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT WHEN

01:44:15.315 --> 01:44:17.551
WE GIVE. A HARD. TIME THE BILL

01:44:17.618 --> 01:44:18.518
WILL BE THE ONES WHO NEED A

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:19.987
HARD TIME VERSUS. A LOT OF

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.421
FOLKS WHO COME IN WE GIVE HIM A

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:22.255
HARD TIME. AND WE MAKE THEIR

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:23.690
LIVES WORSE BECAUSE PRISON IS

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:25.892
HARD. SO TALKING ABOUT

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:27.327
DIVERSION ROGRAMS IS AN

01:44:27.394 --> 01:44:29.296
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION HALF. IS

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:31.098
IMPORTANT OPTIONS THAT PEOPLE

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:32.132
HAVE BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND IS

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:33.634
NOT EASY. TO GET TO THE

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.068
DIVERSION PROGRAM. IT IS NOT

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:36.570
EASY TO GET OUT OF A DIVERSION

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:38.372
PROGRAM. BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:39.640
IN IT YOU ARE CONSTANTLY

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:41.375
MONITORED AND SUPPORTED. AND

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:42.909
HAS SOLD IF YOU FALL OFF ONE

01:44:42.976 --> 01:44:44.778
LITTLE BIT YOU'RE OUT. YOU'RE

01:44:44.845 --> 01:44:46.179
OUT OF THE DIVERSION PROGRAM

01:44:46.246 --> 01:44:46.780
AND THEN YOU'RE BACK INTO THE

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:47.347
REGION WHICH- WHICH OF THE

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:48.782
FELONY OR WHATEVER IT WAS. SO

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:49.983
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING WHEN YOU

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:52.119
TALK TO JUDGES AND- OTHERS THAT

01:44:52.185 --> 01:44:53.754
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO DO.

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:54.988
AND GIVING JUDGES SOME

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:57.124
DISCRETION GIVING IDA SOME

01:44:57.190 --> 01:44:58.225
DISCRETION TO REALLY MAKE.

01:44:58.291 --> 01:45:01.495
DECISIONS BASED ON. WHO WE SEE.

01:45:01.561 --> 01:45:02.663
BEFORE THEM AND WHAT THAT

01:45:02.729 --> 01:45:04.431
PERSON'S POTENTIAL IS WHAT.

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:05.966
PASSES BEEN. BECOME IMPORTANT

01:45:06.033 --> 01:45:11.004
ACT I KNOW WHEN WE WERE. DOING

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:16.043
THINGS. FOR YEARS AGO WHEN WE-

01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:18.311
AT. OUT OF THINGS THAT WE- IT

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:20.414
WOULD TAKE THE BAIT ALL RIGHT.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.615
VERSION PROGRAMS THAT INVOLVES

01:45:21.682 --> 01:45:22.549
AND SOCIAL WORK IN ALL KINDS OF

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:23.250
FOLKS MAKE THESE TO. AND IF

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:25.585
QUITE INTENSIVE AND EVERYONE

01:45:25.652 --> 01:45:26.086
DID MAKE IT THROUGH THE

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:28.221
DIVERSION PROGRAM YOU KNOW THEY

01:45:28.288 --> 01:45:29.156
DIDN'T MAKE IT BUT THOSE WHO

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:33.193
DID BOB YOU KNOW DID SOMETHING

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.529
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TERMS OF

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:36.096
BUILDING THEIR LIVES AND GO

01:45:36.163 --> 01:45:36.663
BACK AND HAVING ONLY HNGING

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:38.732
OVER HERE. COMING OUT. BUT I

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:39.666
ALSO THINK SO THE THINGS ARE

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:42.369
COMP. AND NONE OF THEM ARE.

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:44.504
GUARANTEE YOU KNOW OUR PRISON

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:46.373
SYSTEM IS A CRAP SHOOT YOU KNOW

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.441
WHETHER THAT AND THEY REALLY

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:48.875
REAL BILL THE TABLE TO MAKE

01:45:48.942 --> 01:45:49.810
THEM WORK AND SO IT'S A

01:45:49.876 --> 01:45:51.812
CONSTANT EFFORT TO. TO DEAL

01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:53.146
WITH THE CHALLENGES OF JUST

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:54.948
PEOPLE WHO FLIES IN HOW IN THE

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:57.284
AND WHAT HUMAN BEINGS DO- AND

01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:59.352
SO IT'S NONE OF IT IS SECURED

01:45:59.419 --> 01:46:01.354
AND ABSOLUTE AND WE FOUND THAT

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:02.856
MANY OF OUR ABSOLUTE PROGRAM TO

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:04.024
ONES THAT DON'T WORK WHEN WE

01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:05.158
HAVE AN ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:06.593
SENSE. THAT A PERSON HAS TO

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:08.962
HAVE BEEN ABLE DETERMINES. IT

01:46:09.029 --> 01:46:10.063
AND WE SEE IT THREE STRIKES

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:11.398
OKAY THREE STRIKES AMEND WHAT

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:12.966
THE STRATEGY IS YOU GET IT'S

01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:15.268
NOT A PEOPLE AND YOU GET X.

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:16.103
NUMBER OF YEARS AND SO WE GET

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:19.106
SOMEOF THESE FOLKS. IN PRISON

01:46:19.172 --> 01:46:24.111
FOR. THIRTY FOUR. UNDER THIS

01:46:24.177 --> 01:46:25.112
TERM IS BLOWING UP. AND ALL OF

01:46:25.178 --> 01:46:26.113
OUR- BECAUSE A THE- OF THE LACK

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:26.747

IN THE IN THE BIG. OF A FIVE.

01:46:27.748 --> 01:46:29.216
SO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TRYING

01:46:29.282 --> 01:46:30.350
TO BACK OUT OF THAT ABSOLUTE

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.119
STUFF. AND GET TO THE POINT

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:34.154
WHERE OUR JUDGES AND OUR- AND

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:35.422
LAWYERS AND OTHERS HAVE SOME

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:37.657
DISCRETION TO MAKE- RATHER THAN

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:39.092
JUST BELIEVING THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:46:39.159 --> 01:46:40.260

WE ALWAYS LOOK AT THOSE WITH

01:47:28.975 --> 01:47:29.843
THE ALSO SOME CASES THAT ARE

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:31.178

01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:49.095
STANDARDS. BY WHICH WE JUDGE

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:50.030
THOSE THOSE PLACES THAT WOULD

01:47:50.096 --> 01:47:51.731

STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THIS IS

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:21.540

IS A VERY CRITICAL PROGRAM AND

02:01:30.416 --> 02:01:33.019
WALL. I KNOW THAT THAT. IT IS

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:35.821
DIFFICULT TO BE ADDING TO A

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:38.257
PARTICULAR PROGRAM. THIS IS A

02:01:38.324 --> 02:01:40.092
POPULATION THAT AS WE ALL KNOW

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.761
DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR

02:01:41.827 --> 02:01:44.330
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. SO IF

THEY ARE FACING HARDSHIP. S. DE

02:01:48.668 --> 02:01:49.902
THE NET THAT OTHER MILLIONS OF

CALIFORNIANS. HOW TO BUILD

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:54.640
THEMSELVES TO SO WHILE WE ARE.

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:56.375
PRUNING AND CUTTING DIFFERENT

02:01:56.442 --> 02:01:59.311
AREAS OF THE BUDGET. WE HAVE

02:01:59.378 --> 02:02:01.480
GREATLY EXPANDED THE AMOUNT OF

02:02:01.547 --> 02:02:03.416
UNEMPLOYMENT. INSURANCE

02:02:03.482 --> 02:02:06.052
BENEFITS TO PEOPLE TO MILLIONS

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:06.886
OF CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:02:06.952 --> 02:02:10.256
OUT OF WORK IN SO THIS PROGRAM-

02:02:10.322 --> 02:02:13.025
WILL HELP THOSE FAMILIES WHO

02:02:13.092 --> 02:02:16.128
WERE WORKING THAT IN PARTICULAR

02:02:16.195 --> 02:02:19.231
HARD WORKING- AND ARE

02:02:19.298 --> 02:02:21.333
STRUGGLING AND I THINK THIS IS

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:23.736
ONE OF THE- WAYS THAT WE COULD

02:02:23.803 --> 02:02:25.471
TO THEM WITH. PROGRAM I THINK

02:02:25.538 --> 02:02:27.006
MAKES A SICK CAN AMOUNT OF

02:02:27.073 --> 02:02:29.542
SENSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:02:29.608 --> 02:02:32.211
HAD CHAMPION LEGISLATIVELY LAST

02:02:32.278 --> 02:02:32.712

PROGRAM WE'RE UNABLE TO GET IT.

02:02:35.214 --> 02:02:37.450
BUT THE FACT THAT THESE

02:02:37.516 --> 02:02:39.418
FAMILIES THESE WORKING FAMILIES

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:40.619

THEY WERE WORKING BUT THEY

02:02:46.492 --> 02:02:49.128
CAN'T BECAUSE- OF THEIR-

02:02:49.195 --> 02:02:51.263
DOCUMENTATION STATUS I THINK.

02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:52.465
THIS PROGRAM MAKES A LOT OF

02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:53.733
SENSE IT'S A VERY SMALL

02:02:53.799 --> 02:02:55.401
INVESTMENT CONSIDERING

02:02:55.468 --> 02:02:57.269

INSTRUCTION REALLY HAS- THE

02:21:41.092 --> 02:21:44.195
BEST- OUTCOMES FOR THEM THE

02:21:44.262 --> 02:21:45.330
SECOND THING THAT WE WANT FOLKS

02:21:45.396 --> 02:21:46.664
TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN THEY'RE

02:21:46.731 --> 02:21:47.298
MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE TYPE

02:21:47.365 --> 02:21:49.133
PROGRAM THEY'RE GOING TO OFFER

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:50.869
THAT YOU TO DO IT WOULD HELP ME

02:21:50.935 --> 02:21:54.172
SAFETY- INFORMAL BUT THEY NEED

02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:55.974
TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT

02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:58.309
IS THE STATE AT ALL GOT. IT

02:21:58.376 --> 02:21:58.910
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

HEALTH WHAT IS THEIR LOCAL I'M

02:22:01.012 --> 02:22:02.580
COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS

02:22:02.647 --> 02:22:05.250
GUIDANCE- FOR ENSURING SAFETY

02:22:05.316 --> 02:22:06.251
IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF

02:22:06.317 --> 02:22:09.053
COURSE PUBLIC SAFETY IS FIRST

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:12.090
AND FOREMOST FOR ALL OUR

02:22:12.156 --> 02:22:12.690
STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ON

02:22:12.757 --> 02:22:17.028
THE ALL OF THAT. SOME QUESTION

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:20.832
WHETHER. CAN OFFER A HYPER OR A

02:22:20.899 --> 02:22:23.001
DIFFERENT BURNING PRO YOU KNOW

WITHOUT- THE BEACON TO THE

02:22:26.137 --> 02:22:27.005
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DOCTOR

02:22:27.071 --> 02:22:27.939
CERTAINLY THEY DON'T NEED TO

02:22:28.006 --> 02:22:29.974
GET PERMISSION OR APPROVAL IN

02:22:30.041 --> 02:22:31.376
ORDER TO DO THAT BUT THEY DO

02:22:31.442 --> 02:22:33.044
NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT

02:22:33.111 --> 02:22:34.512
THE REQUIREMENTS ARE HEALTH AND

02:22:34.579 --> 02:22:36.314
SAFETY HOW THEY CAN IMPLEMENT

02:22:36.381 --> 02:22:38.283
THAT GIVEN- THAT THE

02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:39.684
PHILIPPINES AND STAFFAND

02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:40.184
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY

02:22:40.251 --> 02:22:44.022
CURRENTLY HOT. SO HOPEFULLY

02:22:44.088 --> 02:22:45.189
THAT. THIRTY BUT I'M HAPPY TO

02:22:45.256 --> 02:22:46.157
ANSWER ANY FURTHER YOU MAY HAVE

02:22:46.224 --> 02:22:47.258
YEAH I THINK THAT HELPFUL I WAS

02:22:47.325 --> 02:22:49.327
GOING TO. SUGGEST THAT EITHER

02:22:49.394 --> 02:22:50.995
THAT CLEAN UP LEGISLATION BUT

02:22:51.062 --> 02:22:52.697
IF YOU THINK LOWER THE JOURNAL

02:22:52.764 --> 02:22:53.665
WOULD SUFFICE THAT THE INTENT

02:22:53.731 --> 02:22:56.768
OF THAT. I THINK THAT IS- THAT

02:22:56.834 --> 02:23:00.171
THAT SAID- A PATH AS WELL. HE

02:23:00.238 --> 02:23:01.706
HE DIDN'T ASK THE ONE OTHER

02:23:01.773 --> 02:23:03.341
QUESTION THAT THAT- HAS BEEN

02:23:03.408 --> 02:23:05.209
NOW SAYS. WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF

02:23:05.276 --> 02:23:06.511
PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA

02:23:06.577 --> 02:23:07.545
DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON WHAT TO

02:23:07.612 --> 02:23:10.648
DO DURING KOBE NINETEEN- SOME

02:23:10.715 --> 02:23:12.650
PARENTS MAY WANT TO KEEP THEIR

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:15.420
KIDS AT HOME. AND SO THERE IS A

02:23:15.486 --> 02:23:17.355
RISK ALSO. QUESTIONS AS FAR AS

02:23:17.422 --> 02:23:20.024
WHETHER THAT WOULD- PROHIBIT

02:23:20.091 --> 02:23:22.126
SCHOOLS FROM OFFERING FOR FROM

02:23:22.193 --> 02:23:24.963
OFFERING. OR PROVIDING SOLELY

02:23:25.029 --> 02:23:26.297
DISTANCE LEARNING FOR PARENTS

02:23:26.364 --> 02:23:27.598
WHO WANT TO KEEP THEIR THEIR

02:23:27.665 --> 02:23:29.901
STUDENTS ATHOME DURING THE-

02:23:29.968 --> 02:23:34.539
CALL THE NINETEEN ERA. YEAH BUT

02:23:34.605 --> 02:23:35.773
THAT THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:39.043
QUESTION AND I THINK THAT OUR-

02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:41.646
FIRST PRIORITY REALLY IS- TO

02:23:41.713 --> 02:23:44.148
ENSURE THAT- EVERY CHILD IS

02:23:44.215 --> 02:23:46.150
GIVEN THE OPTION TO THE EXTENT

02:23:46.217 --> 02:23:47.652
THAT THAT. HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:23:47.719 --> 02:23:48.720
PERMITTED TO HAVE BEEN IN

02:23:48.786 --> 02:23:52.156
CLASSROOMS- EXPERIENCE- THAT

02:23:52.223 --> 02:23:53.391
THAT CERTAINLY THE NUMBER ONE

02:23:53.458 --> 02:23:56.928
PRIORITY- YOU KNOW I. IT'S

02:23:56.995 --> 02:23:58.763
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO GUESS

02:23:58.830 --> 02:24:01.532
WHAT- CODED NINETEEN IS GOING

02:24:01.599 --> 02:24:02.800
TO DO THROUGHOUT THE NEXT YOU

02:24:02.867 --> 02:24:04.068
KNOW YEARS THE TO THE EXTENT

02:24:04.135 --> 02:24:05.803
THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE. YOU KNOW%

02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:07.372
A WONDERFUL OUTCOME WORKABLE

02:24:07.438 --> 02:24:08.740
NINETEEN BECOMES NO LONGER AN

02:24:08.806 --> 02:24:10.575
ISSUE FOR US- IT'S CERTAINLY

02:24:10.641 --> 02:24:12.076
THE INTENT OF THE STATE WE GO

02:24:12.143 --> 02:24:15.446
BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL IN

02:24:15.513 --> 02:24:16.948
CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION- AND THAT

02:24:17.015 --> 02:24:20.385
IS. OUR GOAL- FOR SCHOOL TO

02:24:20.451 --> 02:24:21.819
THAT ONE OFFER OPTIONS FOR

02:24:21.886 --> 02:24:23.921
PARENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW

02:24:23.988 --> 02:24:25.623
ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHO ORDER

02:24:25.690 --> 02:24:27.291
TO ALIGN WITH SOCIAL THE

02:24:27.358 --> 02:24:28.626
REQUIREMENT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:24:28.693 --> 02:24:30.962
FACILITIES- TO. TO A COP

02:24:31.029 --> 02:24:32.230
PERSONAL BUSINESS AND THEY'RE

02:24:32.296 --> 02:24:34.132
OFFERING PARENTS THREE CHOICES

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:35.233
THE FIRST WOULD BE A FULL

02:24:35.299 --> 02:24:38.469
CLASSROOM- INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL

02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:40.571
THANK YOU HI IN THE WOULD BE.

02:24:40.638 --> 02:24:42.340
LEARNING ONLY AND THROUGH THAT

02:24:42.407 --> 02:24:43.674
BECAUSE THEY'VE COME OUT READ

02:24:43.741 --> 02:24:46.611
TO THEIR PARENTS THEY KNOW THAT

02:24:46.677 --> 02:24:53.418
THAT'S GOING TO HELP DOWN LOW.

02:24:53.484 --> 02:24:56.421
DOWN THERE ON THAT. TO COMPLY

02:24:56.487 --> 02:24:57.655
WITH HEALTHY SAFETY SO I IF THE

02:24:57.722 --> 02:24:59.857
QUESTION IS CAN THIS PROVIDE A

02:24:59.924 --> 02:25:01.059
DISAPPOINTING ONLY PRO THAT

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:02.160
THEIR PARENTS PREFERENCE IS I

02:25:02.226 --> 02:25:03.428
WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S NOT

02:25:03.494 --> 02:25:04.395
THAT'S NOT CONTEMPLATE BY THE

02:25:04.462 --> 02:25:05.797
LAKE HOWEVER TO THE X. THAT

02:25:05.863 --> 02:25:08.633
THAT THERE ARE- PROGRAMS BEING

02:25:08.699 --> 02:25:09.801

THE PROGRAM AND THAT IS

02:25:14.439 --> 02:25:16.808

PROVIDES CLARITY THAT YOU'RE

02:25:17.909 --> 02:25:19.777
LOOKING FOR OKAY THANK YOU. THE

02:25:19.844 --> 02:25:21.913
SECOND ISSUE IS RELATED TO

EIGHTY A AND HOLD HARMLESS AND

02:25:24.582 --> 02:25:26.317
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT'S%

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:26.918
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SPECIALLY

02:25:26.984 --> 02:25:30.121
AT SCHOOLS HAVE KIDS NOT

02:25:30.188 --> 02:25:31.823

HAVE THEM BE- FINANCE AND

02:25:35.493 --> 02:25:36.828
STABLE BECAUSE OF THAT SO

02:25:36.894 --> 02:25:38.396
CONTINUE WHAT WE DID THIS PAST

02:25:38.463 --> 02:25:40.565

FOCUSING ON THE ACTUAL HEAD

02:26:00.785 --> 02:26:04.021

02:26:04.088 --> 02:26:06.090
SCHOOL DISTRICTS- COUPLE HERE

02:26:06.157 --> 02:26:07.959
LOCALLY THAT I'VE ASKED ABOUT

02:26:08.025 --> 02:26:09.794
HOW THAT RELATES TO THE TO

02:26:09.861 --> 02:26:11.129
GROWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

GROWTH SO- WHAT IS OUR ANSWER

02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:19.237
TO THEM AS FAR AS HOW THEY BE

02:26:19.303 --> 02:26:22.106
ABLE TO SURVIVE. DURING THIS

02:26:22.173 --> 02:26:27.478
NEXT- BUDGET YEAR. YES WE'VE

02:26:27.545 --> 02:26:29.380
ALSO HEARD THAT QUESTION UNTIL

02:26:29.447 --> 02:26:30.081
WHEN WE WERE MAKING THE

02:26:30.148 --> 02:26:31.716
DECISION AROUND EIGHTY A HOLD

02:26:31.782 --> 02:26:33.151
HARMLESS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE

02:26:33.217 --> 02:26:34.285
BUDGET AND DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY

02:26:34.352 --> 02:26:36.721
REDUCTION TWO LPS FAST- TO

RATES LARGELY AT NINETEEN

02:26:41.225 --> 02:26:42.426
TWENTY LEVEL- AND DOES NOT

OF THOSE ARE HUGE. HUGE

02:26:48.499 --> 02:26:50.101
MAINTENANCE AS OF FUNDING FOR

02:26:50.168 --> 02:26:52.537
SCHOOL- THAT WE THOUGHT WERE

02:26:52.603 --> 02:26:54.005
REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE

02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:55.406

ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

02:26:58.442 --> 02:27:00.678
WE KNOW THAT IN- IN IN ANY

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:01.746
NORMAL YEAR WE WOULD BE IN A

02:27:01.812 --> 02:27:02.947
DECLINING ENROLLMENT

02:27:03.014 --> 02:27:06.517
ENVIRONMENT- STATEWIDE. AND

02:27:06.584 --> 02:27:09.654
ACOSTA LPS THAT- REFLECT THAT

TWENTY ONE WITH WHAT IT WAS

02:27:19.664 --> 02:27:20.765
NINETEEN TWENTY LIKELY TO BE

02:27:20.831 --> 02:27:26.070
HIGHER- AND- CREATE THIS. HOT

YOU WERE. WE WERE AT THE WHOLE

02:27:28.105 --> 02:27:29.307

WILL BE A TO BE FOR GROW. AND

02:27:33.010 --> 02:27:35.313
THOSE THAT HAVE DECLINE WILL

02:27:35.379 --> 02:27:36.914
WILL SIMPLY BE FUNDED AT A

02:27:36.981 --> 02:27:40.251
LOWER LEVEL. OR TO BE FUN AND

WHICH TEND TO BE- YOU KNOW LESS

02:28:09.714 --> 02:28:10.481
AND LESS HOT THEY'RE NOT

02:28:10.548 --> 02:28:12.617
THEY'RE LESS PREPARED FOR- I

02:28:12.683 --> 02:28:15.019

02:28:39.877 --> 02:28:43.414
TO. HAS THE GREATEST ABILITY BY.

02:28:43.481 --> 02:28:45.082
ALL RIGHT I THINK THERE ARE

02:28:45.149 --> 02:28:46.517
STILL SOME DISTRICTS THAT WILL

02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:48.619
HAVE- QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BUT

02:28:48.686 --> 02:28:51.922
I REALIZE THAT IT WAS THE- THAT

02:28:51.989 --> 02:28:54.759
THE SOLUTION TO HELP- THE MOST

02:28:54.825 --> 02:28:55.660
AMOUNT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:28:55.726 --> 02:28:56.527
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNI SO I

02:28:56.594 --> 02:28:59.263
UNDERSTAND THAT. LAST ISSUES

02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:01.666
RELATED TO- LAYOFFS AND WE DO

02:29:01.732 --> 02:29:03.134
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:06.370
SIGNIFICANT- RESOURCES THIS

02:29:06.437 --> 02:29:11.309
BUDGET. FEDERAL FUNDING AND

02:29:11.375 --> 02:29:11.876
POTENTIALLY DEFERRALS. MAKE

02:29:11.942 --> 02:29:14.345
SURE. SCHOOL THANK OVER THE

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:17.782
LAST YEAR SO THE LAYOFFS IS

02:29:17.848 --> 02:29:19.550
ISN'T THAT- CONCERNING BECAUSE

02:29:19.617 --> 02:29:20.618
THERE SHOULDN'T THERE REALLY

02:29:20.685 --> 02:29:23.087
SHOULDN'T BE- THE NEED- EXCEPT

02:29:23.154 --> 02:29:25.122
FOR A COUPLE POTENTIAL SCHOOL

02:29:34.498 --> 02:29:37.601

02:29:37.668 --> 02:29:39.270

NORMAL PRACTICE OF FUNDING

TRULY A DEVIATION FROM IT. THE

02:31:39.089 --> 02:31:39.924
WORD IS THAT THAT THERE'S GOING

02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:43.761

02:33:15.586 --> 02:33:17.087
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THOSE

02:33:17.154 --> 02:33:18.956
ENTITIES HOWEVER AND I DO

02:33:19.023 --> 02:33:20.124
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE THAT THE

02:33:20.190 --> 02:33:21.625
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:33:21.692 --> 02:33:22.092
LEGISLATURE HAPPENING

SO I A I KNOW THAT IT IS. A

02:33:27.731 --> 02:33:29.266
TOPIC OF DISCUSSION- I CAN'T

02:33:29.333 --> 02:33:31.368
NECESSARILY COMMENT ON ON WHERE

02:33:31.435 --> 02:33:33.070
IT'S HEADED AT THIS TIME- BUT I

02:33:33.137 --> 02:33:34.104
KNOW THAT IT DID IT IS

02:33:34.171 --> 02:33:36.540
SOMETHING THAT- HAD BEEN AND

02:33:36.607 --> 02:33:38.442

WELL THERE IS SOMETHING COMING

02:33:44.548 --> 02:33:45.649
BACK BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO

02:33:45.716 --> 02:33:47.184
THINK OF THOSE ESPECIALLY SOME

02:33:47.251 --> 02:33:48.452
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE HAD REAL

02:33:48.519 --> 02:33:50.921
INCREASES IN A MOMENT OF NOT

02:33:50.988 --> 02:33:51.956
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

02:33:52.022 --> 02:33:53.424
ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT THEY

02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:54.792
HAVE FOR THE COMING YEAR AND

02:33:54.858 --> 02:33:57.361
THAT WOULD BE MOST UNFORTUNATE-

02:33:57.428 --> 02:33:58.896
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- LEARNING

02:33:58.963 --> 02:34:01.231
LOSS AND I KNOW THERE WERE-

02:34:01.298 --> 02:34:03.467
BILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT FOUR

02:34:03.534 --> 02:34:05.636
FIVE BILLION A CAME IN FROM THE

02:34:05.703 --> 02:34:08.072
FANS TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF

02:34:08.138 --> 02:34:08.839
LEARNING LOS. YEAH IS THAT

02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:10.441
MONEY JUST FOLDED INTO THE ACT

02:34:10.507 --> 02:34:12.142
ALLOCATION ARE WE REALLY

02:34:12.209 --> 02:34:14.545
LOOKING AT. THOSE GROUPS WHERE

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:15.746
THERE HAS REALLY TRULY BRAND

02:34:15.813 --> 02:34:17.247
SOME LEARNING LOSS- MY

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:19.550
UNDERSTANDING. OF FROM OF THE

02:34:19.617 --> 02:34:22.319
DEPARTMENT. OF THE CD THAT.

02:34:22.386 --> 02:34:23.754
THERE ARE POCKETS OF STUDENTS

02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:25.723
AT LIKE TWENTY THIRTY PERCENT.

02:34:25.789 --> 02:34:27.458
OF IN SOME SCHOOLS AND

02:34:27.524 --> 02:34:28.692
COMMUNITIES WHERE THE KIDS HAVE

02:34:28.759 --> 02:34:30.661
NEVER EVEN TURNED. THEIR ALL

02:34:30.728 --> 02:34:32.663
THEIR THEIR A DISTANCE LEARNING

02:34:32.730 --> 02:34:34.632
MATERIAL SO THAT THERE ARE.

02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:35.699
FOLKS WHO WOULD NOT EVEN

02:34:35.766 --> 02:34:37.401
ACCOUNT FOR THAT WE HAVE NOT

02:34:37.468 --> 02:34:39.870
GONE TO FIND AND TO. SEE WHERE

02:34:39.937 --> 02:34:41.005
THEY ARE AND WHY THE ART OF

02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:42.373
ROLLED IN SOME KIND OF.

02:34:42.439 --> 02:34:44.174
DISTANCE LEARNING ACTIVITY AND

02:34:44.241 --> 02:34:46.410
MOSTLY THOSE KIDS ARE AT THE

02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:48.545
BOTTOM AND SOME OF THE INNER

02:34:48.612 --> 02:34:49.446
CITY SCHOOLS SO. IS MONEY

02:34:49.513 --> 02:34:50.414
TARGETED TOWARD BETTER HAVE WE

02:34:50.481 --> 02:34:52.149
JUST. INTO THE GENERAL FUND

02:34:52.216 --> 02:34:53.784
BECAUSE WE- BELIEVE WE HAVE A

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:55.352
CRISISA WE HAVE A CRISIS AND

02:34:55.419 --> 02:34:57.755
AS A RESULT. WE JUST OF GIVING

02:34:57.821 --> 02:34:59.556
UP THE MONEY BASED ON EIGHTY

02:34:59.623 --> 02:35:01.058
EIGHT THE- THE- I THINK ITS

02:35:01.125 --> 02:35:03.160
FIBER. OF FIVE OR SIX BILLION I

02:35:03.227 --> 02:35:05.029
CAME IN FOR SUPPOSEDLY LEARNING

02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:07.064
LOSS FROM FITS. YES I'LL MAKE

02:35:07.131 --> 02:35:08.899
TWO QUICK POINTS AND- JESSICA

02:35:08.966 --> 02:35:09.967
COULD PROVIDE MORE DETAILS

02:35:10.034 --> 02:35:12.336
WELL- FIRST- SO. THEY WERE VERY

02:35:12.403 --> 02:35:14.605
SOURCES OF FEDERAL FUNDING-

02:35:14.672 --> 02:35:16.540
THAT WERE PROVIDED FOR

02:35:16.607 --> 02:35:17.107
EDUCATION BUT I THINK. WHAT

02:35:17.174 --> 02:35:18.776
YOU'RE REFERRING TO SPECIFIC.

02:35:18.842 --> 02:35:21.145
EVER IS THEY PROVIDED OVERALL

02:35:21.211 --> 02:35:22.513
NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

02:35:22.579 --> 02:35:24.014
TO THE STATE IN FLEXIBLE

BILLION. IS GOING TO BE GOING

02:37:21.098 --> 02:37:22.966
OUT BASED AS TOTAL LPS

02:37:23.033 --> 02:37:26.069
ALLOCATION SO THERE THE VAST

02:37:26.136 --> 02:37:27.504
MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS ARE BEING

02:37:27.571 --> 02:37:28.705

DID NOT GET ANY INSTRUCTION.

02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:46.223
DURING THIS TIME FRAME ARE WE

02:37:46.290 --> 02:37:47.491
IF BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TALKING

02:37:47.558 --> 02:37:49.193
ABOUT LEARNING LOS ONE OF THE

02:37:49.259 --> 02:37:51.228
GREAT CONCERNS AT THE TIME WAS

02:37:51.295 --> 02:37:52.496
THAT THIS WOULD HAVE ITS

02:37:52.563 --> 02:37:53.664
GREATEST IMPACT OFTENTIMES OF

02:37:53.730 --> 02:37:55.766
ONE. OF NOT NECESSARILY KIDS

02:37:55.833 --> 02:37:56.700
WITH THE LOW INCOME BUT

02:37:56.767 --> 02:37:58.202
BASICALLY SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT

RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF KIDS

02:37:59.937 --> 02:38:01.805

MISSING FROM THIS FROM THE

02:38:13.150 --> 02:38:15.886
SYSTEM AND ITS IT AND THAT'S

02:38:15.953 --> 02:38:18.388
WHY I'M SO NOT USING ANY OF

02:38:18.455 --> 02:38:20.457
THAT KIND OF DATA. TO MAKE THE-

02:38:20.524 --> 02:38:24.862
USER THIS THE DAY WE HAVE. IT

02:38:24.928 --> 02:38:25.996
WAS. AND SO FORTH AND SO ON

02:38:26.063 --> 02:38:29.099

02:43:19.723 --> 02:43:21.191
LEVELS FOR GROWING CHARTER

02:43:21.258 --> 02:43:22.826
SCHOOLS I ALREADY MENTIONED

02:43:22.893 --> 02:43:23.693
DISTRICTS GROWING DISTRICTS

02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:25.495
WOULD ALSO BE IMPACTED.

02:43:25.562 --> 02:43:26.897
CHARTERS WILL BE IMPACTED IN

02:43:26.963 --> 02:43:29.499
TWO KEY WAYS FOR CHARTERS THAT

02:43:29.566 --> 02:43:31.535
ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR GREAT

02:43:31.601 --> 02:43:34.271
EXPANSION PER THERE AT LEGALLY

02:43:34.337 --> 02:43:36.473
BINDING CHARTER. AT THEY WILL

02:43:36.540 --> 02:43:37.440
CERTAINLY DO HAVE THE

02:43:37.507 --> 02:43:39.176
DISCRETION NOT TO EXPAND GREATS

02:43:39.242 --> 02:43:41.745
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO- INFORM

02:43:41.811 --> 02:43:42.946
FAMILIES WHO THEY'VE ALREADY

02:43:43.013 --> 02:43:44.614
AND ROLLED OF THAT DECISION

02:43:44.681 --> 02:43:46.082
THEY'VE SECURED FACILITIES

02:43:46.149 --> 02:43:47.050
THEY'VE MADE THE HIRING

02:43:47.117 --> 02:43:48.218
DECISIONS. THAT WOULD

02:43:48.285 --> 02:43:50.120
POTENTIALLY RESULT IN LAYOFFS

02:43:50.187 --> 02:43:51.621
AND THE SECOND OF COURSE IS

02:43:51.688 --> 02:43:53.523
THAT SOME CHARTERS HAVE YOU

02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:55.492
SEEN A GROUNDSWELL OF INTEREST

02:43:55.559 --> 02:43:57.060
DURING THE PANDEMIC HAVING BEEN

02:43:57.127 --> 02:43:58.461
DISAPPOINTED BY. SOME OF THE

02:43:58.528 --> 02:43:59.396
OLD DISTANCE LEARNING

02:43:59.462 --> 02:44:00.964
EXPERIENCES THAT THEY'VE HAD IN

02:44:01.031 --> 02:44:03.800
TRADITIONAL- PUBLIC SCHOOLS-

02:44:03.867 --> 02:44:06.136
ALSO JUST WANTED TO- TO MENTION

02:44:06.203 --> 02:44:08.071
AS WELL THAT- THE ASSOCIATION

02:44:08.138 --> 02:44:10.106
FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE

02:44:10.173 --> 02:44:12.976
UNCERTAINTY. IS PERHAPS AS ADD

02:44:13.043 --> 02:44:17.981
AS POLICY ITSELF- JUMPED OUT TO

02:44:18.048 --> 02:44:19.449
AN SO MANY GOALS WE CANNOT WAIT

02:44:19.516 --> 02:44:21.451
UNTIL AUGUST. THIS BUDGET WILL

02:44:21.518 --> 02:44:23.353
ULTIMATELY DICTATE DECISIONS

02:44:23.420 --> 02:44:24.354
THEY'RE GOING TO BE MADE IN THE

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:26.089
NEXT FEW WEEKS SELL OUT SOME

02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:27.324
CERTAINTY BY THE ADMINISTRATION

02:44:27.390 --> 02:44:29.693
THAT THE ISSUE- WILL BE WORKED

02:44:29.759 --> 02:44:31.194
ON IN RESULT WOULD CERTAINLY BE

02:44:31.261 --> 02:44:33.730

NEED TO BE PASSED TODAY. WE

02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:39.436
DON'T OPPOSE THAT- FRAMEWORK

02:44:39.502 --> 02:44:41.504
MORE BROADLY- BUT WE CERTAINLY

02:44:41.571 --> 02:44:42.939
HOPE THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT

02:44:43.006 --> 02:44:45.642
TO DO MORE- AND I ALSO WANT TO

02:44:45.709 --> 02:44:47.077
JUST MENTION ON THE NâNG NON

02:44:47.143 --> 02:44:49.412
CLASSROOM BASED ISSUE- JUST A

02:44:49.479 --> 02:44:52.182
QUICK REVISION. THAT IN FACT IN

02:44:52.249 --> 02:44:53.149
