PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL MORE BRING

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:39.091 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TO MY ATTENTION.

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:41.594 region:rollup2
I'M SO FAR WE HAVE HAD A KNOW

00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:43.729 region:rollup2
REPLICATIONS OF ANY DELEGATION.

00:22:41.594 --> 00:22:46.632 region:rollup2

THE. POST DELEGATION VISITS BY

00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:50.336 region:rollup2
THE PLANT THE PRISON LAW OFFICE.

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:51.937 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WHAT THEY'RE SEEING

00:22:50.336 --> 00:22:53.906 region:rollup2
BASICALLY HILLS.

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:55.541 region:rollup2
ARE A CONTINUATION.

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:57.276 region:rollup2
OF OPERATIONS OR AN IMPROVEMENT

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:58.544 region:rollup2
IN OPERATIONS.

00:22:57.276 --> 00:23:00.179 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE AT THIS POINT I'M

00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:02.348 region:rollup2
FAIRLY COMFORTABLE THAT THE

00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:03.749 region:rollup2
DECISIONS BUT I MAKING US TO

00:23:02.348 --> 00:23:07.286 region:rollup2

OUR THEY ARE SOLID DECISIONS.

00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:09.788 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING

00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:11.557 region:rollup2
I MEAN FOR MOVING IN THE RIGHT

00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:13.058 region:rollup2
DIRECTION STEADILY.

00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:14.093 region:rollup2
ON SECOND THING I THINK IS

00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:15.394 region:rollup2
USEFUL TO REPORT ON.

00:23:14.093 --> 00:23:17.096 region:rollup2
JUDGE HENDERSON WHO PRESIDED

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:18.464 region:rollup2
OVER THE CASE

00:23:17.096 --> 00:23:20.1000 region:rollup2
A FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TWO

00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:22.935 region:rollup2
UNTIL ON AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND

00:23:20.1000 --> 00:23:25.738 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTEEN.

00:23:22.935 --> 00:23:26.572 region:rollup2
HE HAS RETIRED FROM THE BENCH.

00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:28.140 region:rollup2
AND THE CASE IS NOW BEEN

00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:30.276 region:rollup2
ASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT FEDERAL

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.677 region:rollup2
JUDGE IN SAN FRANCISCO A JOHN

00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:33.646 region:rollup2
TIGER.

00:23:31.677 --> 00:23:36.282 region:rollup2
UP WHO IS TAKING A SLIGHTLY

00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:38.550 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT

00:23:36.282 --> 00:23:39.752 region:rollup2
OF THIS PART OF THE CASE.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:42.821 region:rollup2
I THINK THE THE BIGGEST

00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:44.290 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IS A JUDGE HENDERSON.

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:46.258 region:rollup2
WOULD PROVIDE.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.293 region:rollup2
GARDENS

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.627 region:rollup2
TO ME AND AT TIMES TO THE

00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:50.229 region:rollup2
PARTIES

00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:52.431 region:rollup2
BUT WOULD DO SO MOSTLY

00:23:50.229 --> 00:23:54.667 region:rollup2
INFORMALLY WITHOUT HAVING

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:56.902 region:rollup2
HEARINGS AND MOTIONS.

00:23:54.667 --> 00:23:57.836 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER RESULT.

00:23:56.902 --> 00:24:01.073 region:rollup2
THE CASE WAS.

00:23:57.836 --> 00:24:02.908 region:rollup2
.

00:24:01.073 --> 00:24:03.409 region:rollup2
IT MOVED FORWARD WITHOUT A

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:05.911 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THE BURDENS OF

00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:07.146 region:rollup2
LAWYERS.

00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:07.913 region:rollup2
IF I CAN SAY THAT HAS A LAW

00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:08.914 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR I GET A CHANCE TO SAY

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:10.683 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:12.751 region:rollup2
.

00:24:10.683 --> 00:24:14.687 region:rollup2
WHAT THE LAWYERS BEHIND ME I'M

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:16.956 region:rollup2
SURE ARE BURNING IN THEIR EARS?

00:24:14.687 --> 00:24:18.424 region:rollup2
JUDGE TIGER HAS DECIDED THAT

00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:20.392 region:rollup2
THERE SHOULD BE A STATUS LIKE

00:24:18.424 --> 00:24:21.060 region:rollup2
FORMAL STATUS CONFERENCE IN HIS

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:23.362 region:rollup2
COURT.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:26.198 region:rollup2
EVERY THREE MONTHS OR SO.

00:24:23.362 --> 00:24:28.500 region:rollup2
AND HE HAS REQUIRED THE PARTIES

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:30.235 region:rollup2
TO MEET AND CONFER BEFORE THESE

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.104 region:rollup2
HEARINGS AND PROVIDE A STATUS

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:34.373 region:rollup2
REPORT.

00:24:32.104 --> 00:24:37.242 region:rollup2
AND ARE NO QUESTION THAT'S THAT

00:24:34.373 --> 00:24:38.310 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT MORE FORMAL PROCESS

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:40.346 region:rollup2
IS HELPING TO FOCUS.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:43.048 region:rollup2
THE PARTIES.

00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:45.818 region:rollup2
ON WHAT THEY AGREE IT NEEDS TO

00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:47.586 region:rollup2
BE DONE TO AND THE CASE.

00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:48.854 region:rollup2
AND TO IDENTIFY ANY AREAS OF

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:50.889 region:rollup2
DISAGREEMENT.

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:52.324 region:rollup2
.

00:24:50.889 --> 00:24:54.259 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:55.627 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW TEN

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:57.329 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THE GOLF WOULD HAVE

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:58.364 region:rollup2
BEEN HUGE.

00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:01.166 region:rollup2
BUT AT THIS POINT.

00:24:58.364 --> 00:25:02.434 region:rollup2
THERE ACTUALLYIS. SUBSTANTIAL

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:03.635 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT AS TO WHAT NEEDS TO

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:06.538 region:rollup2
FINISH.

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:07.873 region:rollup2
AND THEN A FEW THINGS THAT NEED

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:09.842 region:rollup2
TO BE DONE WHERE THE PARTIES

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:12.244 region:rollup2

00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:13.245 region:rollup2
WILL. OUR RESOLVE THOSE THAT YES

THEY HAVE TO BE DONE ORIEL

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:15.781 region:rollup2
DECIDE NO THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:17.249 region:rollup2
DONE.

00:25:15.781 --> 00:25:17.716 region:rollup2
THEM BUT THOSE CASE MANAGEMENT

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:19.952 region:rollup2
JOINT CASE MANAGEMENT

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:21.387 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS.

00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:23.222 region:rollup2
PROVIDE RELIEF VERY USEFUL ROAD

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:26.992 region:rollup2
MAP.

00:25:23.222 --> 00:25:28.927 region:rollup2
TO. THE CONCLUSION OF THE CASE.

A WAY TO REACT TO SOME OF THE

00:37:40.225 --> 00:37:42.760 region:rollup2
SPIKES THAT WE'VE SEEN THE

ALLOWING US TO FLEX THESE BIRDS

00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:55.907 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ALLOW US TO BE MORE

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:57.308 region:rollup2
AGILE TO THE POPULATION NEEDS SO

00:37:55.907 --> 00:37:59.577 region:rollup2
WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE TO THOSE

UNDER THE FEDERAL COURTS OKAY.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.049 region:rollup2
MY COMMENTS WERE FINANCE AMAZON

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:48.953 region:rollup2
I ALSO I WOULD HAVE A LITTLE

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:49.220 region:rollup2

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:50.688 region:rollup2
COMMENT.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.356 region:rollup2
.

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.624 region:rollup2
SO IT DOESN'T HURT TO KNOW THE

00:39:51.356 --> 00:39:54.325 region:rollup2
HIPAA DOES A LOT OF THE

00:39:52.624 --> 00:39:55.827 region:rollup2

PROVIDING THE OVERSIGHT.

00:39:55.827 --> 00:39:59.297 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO

COMPARE THE COST OF THAT

00:39:59.297 --> 00:40:03.368 region:rollup2
CONTRACT. FOR WITH MCMANUS TO

00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:04.569 region:rollup2
THE COST OF THE RESOURCES FOR

00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:06.271 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF RESEARCH BECAUSE HIP

00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:07.005 region:rollup2
HOP IS ALREADY DOING A LOT OF

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:07.171 region:rollup2

SO.

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:10.642 region:rollup2
NO THROUGH PUZZLES NOT ONLY TO

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.943 region:rollup2
TRANSITION OVER TO THE OFFICE OF

00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:15.413 region:rollup2
PIC POTS RESOURCES OF THE CAN

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:16.914 region:rollup2
FOCUS MORE ON THE. PATIENT

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:18.950 region:rollup2
MONITORING IT THAT MOVEMENT AS

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:20.184 region:rollup2
WELL. SO I THINK IF WE WERE

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.986 region:rollup2
PROPOSING TO MOVE IT TO THE

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:22.520 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF RESEARCH WE PROBABLY

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:24.489 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE ANOTHER REQUEST

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.623 region:rollup2
HIGHER RESOURCES FOR.

00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:27.925 region:rollup2

PROPOSALS.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:42.040 region:rollup2
FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE

00:40:40.305 --> 00:40:43.241 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE PROVIDED LIMITED

BEDS.

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:49.347 region:rollup2
THESE BEDS WOULD BE STAFFED IN A

00:40:48.713 --> 00:40:51.115 region:rollup2
WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE.

00:40:49.347 --> 00:40:52.450 region:rollup2
.

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:54.052 region:rollup2
TO SERVE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS

BED PATIENTS.

00:40:54.052 --> 00:40:56.954 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:40:55.053 --> 00:40:59.190 region:rollup2

TO ADDRESS THIS NEED.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:11.369 region:rollup2
SECOND WE RECOMMEND REJECTING

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:13.871 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR THE

00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:14.872 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF RESEARCH STAFF.

00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:21.779 region:rollup2
.

00:41:20.011 --> 00:41:22.313 region:rollup2
INACCURACIES ARE PROBLEMS WITH

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:24.215 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH

PROJECTIONS THAT JUSTIFY THE

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:27.418 region:rollup2
EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH COSTS FOR

CDC ARE TO TAKE OVER THESE

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:30.421 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS.

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:31.823 region:rollup2
THIRD AND FINALLY WE RECOMMEND

BECAUSE THESE COULD HELP.

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:39.831 region:rollup2
MOVE PATIENTS INAPPROPRIATE

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:41.232 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FASTER AND REDUCE THE

00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:42.266 region:rollup2
NEED FOR.

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:44.435 region:rollup2
MET MENTAL HEALTH BEDS NOT IN

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:45.536 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

OKAY.

00:41:56.981 --> 00:42:01.652 region:rollup2
THIS QUESTION OBVIOUSLY IS

00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:03.454 region:rollup2

HERE THAT AND THEN ALL THIS

00:42:04.956 --> 00:42:07.725 region:rollup2
WILL KIND OF FIT TOGETHER WITH

00:42:06.391 --> 00:42:09.460 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH

PHASE FOR THESE TWO BUILDINGS.

00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:17.462 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY IMPETUS BEHIND THIS

00:43:15.493 --> 00:43:18.896 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS THAT CCR DOES NOT

CAPACITY.

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:51.496 region:rollup2
IT IT WILL NOT BE REALISTIC FOR

00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:52.997 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO BE IN A POSITION TO

00:43:51.496 --> 00:43:55.266 region:rollup2

AT CDC ARE.

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:47.118 region:rollup2
OCCURRED I THINK A COUPLE OF

00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:49.086 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE IMPORTANT FOR AYE

00:44:47.118 --> 00:44:50.555 region:rollup2
THIS GROUP TO NO ONE IS THAT

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:52.990 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN LABORING UNDER A

00:44:50.555 --> 00:44:54.458 region:rollup2
SERIES OF COURT ACTIONS.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:54.992 region:rollup2

MARCH AND APRIL ORDERS.

00:44:57.962 --> 00:45:04.135 region:rollup2
THAT CONCERN THE DELAY AND

.

00:45:08.339 --> 00:45:12.076 region:rollup2
OF THOSE NUMBERS.

00:45:09.307 --> 00:45:14.078 region:rollup2
AND THE DELAY IN MOVEMENT IS

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:15.980 region:rollup2
INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED WITH

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:18.149 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY TO WITH A SUFFICIENT

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.950 region:rollup2
NUMBER INSUFFICIENT NUMBER. UP

00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:21.886 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:23.087 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT IN

ENDS UP BEING A BIT OF A DOMINO.

00:45:24.322 --> 00:45:27.225 region:rollup2
UP WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING HERE IS

00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:29.227 region:rollup2
REALLY.

00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:32.430 region:rollup2
TAKING IT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:45:29.227 --> 00:45:32.997 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO HOW WE MANAGE THESE

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:35.733 region:rollup2
BEDS.

00:45:32.997 --> 00:45:38.169 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE THE UP PROPOSAL

00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:39.837 region:rollup2
THAT YOU PROVED LAST YEAR UP FOR

00:45:38.169 --> 00:45:41.305 region:rollup2
THAT FLEX BAD FOR TAKING THAT

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:44.475 region:rollup2
SAME CONCEPT HERE.

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:45.509 region:rollup2
AND APPROACH THE IDEA IS TO BE

00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:47.378 region:rollup2
ABLE TO FLEX

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:48.679 region:rollup2
I WITH THE DYNAMIC NEEDS OF THE

00:45:47.378 --> 00:45:50.648 region:rollup2
POPULATION. THOUGHT THE

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:52.717 region:rollup2
POPULATION'S NEEDS FLEX PRETTY

00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:55.052 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY OVER THE COURSE OF

00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:57.088 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR WE NOTE IN THE. WINTER

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:59.957 region:rollup2
FALL WINTER MONTHS THE NEED FOR

00:45:57.088 --> 00:46:01.792 region:rollup2
CRISIS BAD TENDS TO BUY DIP I

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:02.727 region:rollup2
AND IN THE SUMMER MONTHS IT

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:05.796 region:rollup2
TENDS TO INCREASE.

00:46:02.727 --> 00:46:07.698 region:rollup2
AND SO WERE TRYING TO IDENTIFY

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:10.101 region:rollup2
A WAY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:12.203 region:rollup2
THOSE SPIKES IN NEED AND THIS IS

00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:14.138 region:rollup2
ONE WAY OUT THAT WE CAN THINK TO

00:46:12.203 --> 00:46:14.805 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY. ABOUT RESPOND TO

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.874 region:rollup2
THOSE FLEXING NEEDS.

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:19.076 region:rollup2
.

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:21.612 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE CURRENT WEIGHTLESS

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:24.515 region:rollup2
FOR A HOT CRISIS BED MOVEMENT.

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:26.484 region:rollup2
I SHOULD ACTUALLY TAKE ME I'M

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:27.318 region:rollup2
SORRY I SHOULD GO BACK AND

00:46:26.484 --> 00:46:27.818 region:rollup2
REFLECT FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE

00:46:27.318 --> 00:46:29.587 region:rollup2
TODD THE ORDERS THAT WE

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:32.757 region:rollup2
RECEIVED.

00:46:29.587 --> 00:46:35.293 region:rollup2
THE ORDERS REQUIRE OUT STRICT

00:46:32.757 --> 00:46:36.460 region:rollup2
ADHERENCE TO TIME LINES AND HAVE

00:46:35.293 --> 00:46:37.762 region:rollup2
THREATENED.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.598 region:rollup2
.

00:46:37.762 --> 00:46:42.133 region:rollup2
A SANCTION MONETARY SANCTION FOR

00:46:40.598 --> 00:46:43.834 region:rollup2
ABOUT MISSING THOSE TIME LINES.

00:46:42.133 --> 00:46:45.903 region:rollup2
I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:47.371 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH CRISIS

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:48.873 region:rollup2
BET WAIT LESS.

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:50.441 region:rollup2
MANY OF THOSE.

00:46:48.873 --> 00:46:52.743 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WAIT.

00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:55.112 region:rollup2
.

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:57.148 region:rollup2
MUCH LONGER THAN IS APPROPRIATE.

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:58.716 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO

00:46:57.148 --> 00:47:00.184 region:rollup2
TRY TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:46:58.716 --> 00:47:01.952 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:04.588 region:rollup2
SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BEDS.

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:06.357 region:rollup2
AND WE.

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:08.993 region:rollup2
CAN'T ALLOW CONTINUE TO ALLOW

00:47:06.357 --> 00:47:11.329 region:rollup2
THOSE FIVE PATIENTS TO SIT IN.

00:47:08.993 --> 00:47:12.430 region:rollup2
IN APPROPRIATE SETTINGS WAITING

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:15.232 region:rollup2
FOR THE RIGHT THAT.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:17.501 region:rollup2
.

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:19.003 region:rollup2
THIS GUIDE THIS PROPOSAL THOUGH

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:21.605 region:rollup2
DOES RETURN US TO.

00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:23.874 region:rollup2
DOES ALLOW US TO MOVE PEOPLE

THAT THE ADDITIONAL BEDS WOULD

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.879 region:rollup2
NOT BE NECESSARY BY THE TIME THE

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:02.880 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS COULD BE

00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:04.582 region:rollup2
COMPLETED.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.850 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:48:04.582 --> 00:48:07.118 region:rollup2
THESE ADDITIONAL BEDS ARE NEEDED

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:08.452 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR

00:48:07.118 --> 00:48:10.888 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:13.324 region:rollup2
BEDS AND REPLACE UNLICENSED

00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:14.725 region:rollup2
MENTALHEALTH CRISIS BEDS BASED

00:48:13.324 --> 00:48:15.760 region:rollup2
ON THE CURRENT PROJECTIONS.

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:17.361 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MENTAL

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.497 region:rollup2
HEALTH CRISIS BEDS APPEARS TO BE

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:20.998 region:rollup2
MANAGEABLE WITH THE SIXTY FLEX

00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:23.634 region:rollup2
BEDS THAT WE HAD JUST TALKED

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:25.202 region:rollup2
ABOUT A PREVIOUS ITEM.

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:27.605 region:rollup2
IN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:28.606 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ALSO WANTS TO USE

00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:29.974 region:rollup2
THESE PADS TO ADDRESS BROADER.

00:48:28.606 --> 00:48:31.308 region:rollup2
.

00:48:29.974 --> 00:48:32.743 region:rollup2
PROPER BROADER UNLICENSED BED

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:35.446 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:38.015 region:rollup2
WE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT. TO THE

00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:40.151 region:rollup2
EXTENT THE PROJECTIONS ARE IN

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:41.852 region:rollup2
THAT ARE EITHER OVERESTIMATE THE

00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:43.120 region:rollup2
NEED WE COULD BE IN A POSITION

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:45.890 region:rollup2
WHERE WE MAY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:48.225 region:rollup2
OPERATE UNLICENSED BEDS ANYWAY.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:49.460 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE I NEED

00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:50.861 region:rollup2
FOR THESE BEDS IS.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.596 region:rollup2
OVERESTIMATED WE MIGHT BE IN A

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:54.432 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE THE CONSTRUCTION

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:55.266 region:rollup2
IS NOT NECESSARY SO DEPENDS ON

00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:57.067 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:58.102 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN DIFFERENT

00:48:57.067 --> 00:48:58.669 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES IN WHICH THESE

00:48:58.102 --> 00:48:59.170 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS ARE ATTEMPTING TO

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:01.605 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:02.473 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:07.511 region:rollup2
ANY COMMENTS FROM.

00:49:02.473 --> 00:49:08.679 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:10.648 region:rollup2
ONE OF MR LACKEY AROUND SEVEN

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:14.552 region:rollup2
EIGHT AND NINE.

00:49:10.648 --> 00:49:16.153 region:rollup2
ANY COMMENTS ON THE PUBLIC.

00:49:14.552 --> 00:49:18.022 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THAT

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:19.089 region:rollup2
I MEAN THERE BAY BASICALLY WE'RE

00:49:18.022 --> 00:49:21.125 region:rollup2
BEING TOLD THAT BY THE TIME THE

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:21.659 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OCCURS. THAT

00:49:21.125 --> 00:49:22.493 region:rollup2
THEY'LL BE NO NEED FOR THE

00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:24.728 region:rollup2
SPIRITS.

00:49:22.493 --> 00:49:25.496 region:rollup2
SO WE'D BE BUILDING SOMETHING A

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:27.565 region:rollup2
HUNDRED BITS I GUESS.

00:49:25.496 --> 00:49:30.000 region:rollup2
.

00:49:27.565 --> 00:49:31.535 region:rollup2
THAT IN TIME WOULD NOT BE NEED.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.970 region:rollup2
BASED ON YOUR PROJECTIONS OF

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:35.139 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK LIKE

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.974 region:rollup2
I'M THE LEADER IS A CHARLIE

00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:37.808 region:rollup2
PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE AT A

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:40.878 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT WE'VE YOU REVIEW THOSE

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:43.047 region:rollup2
NUMBERS. DIFFERENTLY SO BASED

00:49:40.878 --> 00:49:44.949 region:rollup2
UPON THE CAPACITY OF THE BEDS WE

00:49:43.047 --> 00:49:46.317 region:rollup2
HAVE RIGHT NOW THEY PROJECTED

00:49:44.949 --> 00:49:48.252 region:rollup2
NEEDS FOR ALL LEVELS OF CARE NOT

00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:49.854 region:rollup2
JUST MY HOPE CRISIS BAD BUT FOR

00:49:48.252 --> 00:49:51.856 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE LICENSE LEVELS OF CARE

00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:53.357 region:rollup2
WILL STILL EXCEED OUR CAPACITY

00:49:51.856 --> 00:49:55.793 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD AND WE WOULD NEED

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:57.061 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO USE.

00:49:55.793 --> 00:49:58.596 region:rollup2
UNLOCK UNLICENSED BANDS.

00:49:57.061 --> 00:49:59.663 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BASED ON THE CURRENT

00:49:58.596 --> 00:50:01.332 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT PROJECTIONS SHOWING

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:03.601 region:rollup2
AB DECREASE IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:05.069 region:rollup2
POPULATION OVERALL. THAT'S BASED

00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:05.936 region:rollup2
ON THE FIRST SET A POPULATION

00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:07.104 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS TO INCORPORATE A

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:08.239 region:rollup2
HOME

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:09.306 region:rollup2
PROP FIFTY SEVEN.

00:50:08.239 --> 00:50:11.008 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY MORE TIME IS

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:12.676 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO TRULY SEE WHAT OF

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:14.345 region:rollup2
TREND LINE IS FROM THE LOOK FROM

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:15.980 region:rollup2
THOSE PROJECTIONS MY.

00:50:14.345 --> 00:50:17.581 region:rollup2
THE THE FLEX BUT.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.315 region:rollup2
THE FLEX BEDS WERE MENTIONED

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:20.618 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:22.119 region:rollup2
BITE VIEWING IT ACROSS ALL

00:50:20.618 --> 00:50:23.554 region:rollup2
THREE LEVELS OF CARE ELIMINATES

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:24.989 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT SIXTY BEDS IN THE

00:50:23.554 --> 00:50:26.557 region:rollup2
CRISIS BY CATEGORY THE ICF

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:27.524 region:rollup2
CATEGORY BECAUSE WE'RE SIMPLY

00:50:26.557 --> 00:50:29.326 region:rollup2
SAYING FOR ALL THE BEDS

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:30.828 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR LICENSE CARE. WE

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:32.329 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH AND FOR THE

00:50:30.828 --> 00:50:34.298 region:rollup2
FORESEEABLE FUTURE BASED UPON

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:36.166 region:rollup2
OUR PROJECTIONS WILL NEED TO

00:50:34.298 --> 00:50:37.334 region:rollup2
CONTINUE USING UNLICENSED BEDS.

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:39.904 region:rollup2
AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:41.438 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO A DAY WHEN THE STATE.

00:50:39.904 --> 00:50:43.140 region:rollup2
AS DICK MANY ACTIONS BUT LOOKING

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:45.142 region:rollup2
TO A DAY WHEN THE STATE CAN GET

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:47.478 region:rollup2
OUT OF COURT SUPERVISION.

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:48.512 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING. THE CAPACITY TO

00:50:47.478 --> 00:50:49.680 region:rollup2
PROVIDE CARE BASED ON YOUR OWN

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:52.449 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.918 region:rollup2
IS IT DIFFICULT PART TO US START

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:55.586 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION WITH THE COURT.

00:50:53.918 --> 00:50:59.356 region:rollup2
OKAY SENT IT.

00:50:55.586 --> 00:50:59.590 region:rollup2
OKAY UP.

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:02.059 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:03.093 region:rollup2
ONE MORE POINT.

00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:04.695 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO GO TO THE MIKE THANK

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:06.196 region:rollup2
YOU SORRY OTHER ONE MORE POINT

00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:07.264 region:rollup2
WORTH MENTIONING.

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:08.532 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A COURT ORDER TO RUN THE

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:09.967 region:rollup2
LICENSE BEDS.

00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:11.969 region:rollup2
SO THE COURTS ARE ALLOWING US TO

00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:13.637 region:rollup2
RUN THOSE LICENSE BEDS AND SO.

00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:15.072 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO SEE

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:16.106 region:rollup2
WE NEED THAT COURT ORDER TO KEEP

00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:17.474 region:rollup2
USING THEM SO WE NEED THESE

00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:19.577 region:rollup2
LICENSE BUT TO REPLACE THOSE ON

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:21.612 region:rollup2
LICENSE BIRDS. OTHERWISE THE

00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:23.814 region:rollup2
COURTS ARE ALLOWING US TO

00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:25.215 region:rollup2
CONTINUE SO IF WE WANT TO GET

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:27.518 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM THE COURTS WE WE NEED

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:29.053 region:rollup2
TO TO GET SOME LICENSE BEDS IN

00:51:27.518 --> 00:51:30.187 region:rollup2
THE SOUTH ESPECIALLY.

00:51:29.053 --> 00:51:32.122 region:rollup2
I WE CURRENTLY TRANSPORTING

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:34.058 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO BE SPIRITS.

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:35.726 region:rollup2
BETTER THAT WE DON'T HAVE NOW I

00:51:34.058 --> 00:51:38.062 region:rollup2
MEAN IN TERMS OF NEW YEAR'S GIFT

00:51:35.726 --> 00:51:39.263 region:rollup2
AT SOME BETS. THERE SO WHERE

00:51:38.062 --> 00:51:40.864 region:rollup2
BASICALLY TRANSPORTING

00:51:39.263 --> 00:51:42.800 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THERE THAT YEAH BUT

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:44.401 region:rollup2
THE SHORT VERSION IS THAT WE ARE

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.937 region:rollup2
MOVINGPEOPLE FROM SOUTHERN

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:48.806 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SOMETIMES ALL THE WAY

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:51.775 region:rollup2
UP THE STATE. IN ORDER TO GET

00:51:48.806 --> 00:51:53.110 region:rollup2
THEM INTO A CRISIS SPED UP THE

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:54.311 region:rollup2
TIME IT TAKES.

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:56.246 region:rollup2
.

00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:58.615 region:rollup2
TO MOVE THEM AND THAT THE TRAVEL

00:51:56.246 --> 00:52:01.018 region:rollup2
ITSELF IS DISRUPTIVE TO THE

00:51:58.615 --> 00:52:02.219 region:rollup2
PATIENTS HAD TO THEIR CARE

00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:04.355 region:rollup2
GNAWED IT IS.

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:06.657 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE

00:52:04.355 --> 00:52:08.392 region:rollup2
TO UP KEEP THE UP PATIENTS

00:52:06.657 --> 00:52:10.060 region:rollup2
PROXIMATE TO THEIR UP HOME

00:52:08.392 --> 00:52:10.894 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION AND MINIMIZE THAT

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.363 region:rollup2
TRAVEL.

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:13.764 region:rollup2
WE'VE ENDEAVOR TO DO THAT TO

00:52:12.363 --> 00:52:16.633 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT WE CAN AT THIS

00:52:13.764 --> 00:52:18.035 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL GETS US PART AWAY THERE

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:19.737 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS NOT A PERMANENT FIX.

00:52:18.035 --> 00:52:22.106 region:rollup2
THE PERMANENT SOLUTION IS THOSE

00:52:19.737 --> 00:52:25.242 region:rollup2
HUNDRED ADDITIONAL BATS.

00:52:22.106 --> 00:52:26.443 region:rollup2
OKAY OKAY IT IN ADDITION WE HAVE

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:28.212 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:30.114 region:rollup2
BEDS RGD AND WE HAVE TWELVE IT

00:52:28.212 --> 00:52:30.981 region:rollup2
CIW WHICH IS AN ALL FEMALE

00:52:30.114 --> 00:52:32.449 region:rollup2
FACILITY.

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:36.120 region:rollup2
SO LET'S GET TWENTY SIX BEDS IN

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:37.454 region:rollup2
THE IN THE SOUTHERN REGION.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.889 region:rollup2
MADAM CHAIR IF I MIGHT THERE IS

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:40.457 region:rollup2
ALSO A PROPOSAL FROM THE

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:42.092 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS ITEM THAT INCLUDES

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:44.628 region:rollup2
MOVING TWENTY BEDS ALBEIT

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:46.964 region:rollup2
UNLICENSED BIRDS REMOVED FROM A

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:48.465 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO DOWN TO SOUTHERN

00:52:46.964 --> 00:52:50.134 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. SEVEN OKAY.

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:52.703 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT.

00:52:50.134 --> 00:52:54.104 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS.

00:52:52.703 --> 00:52:54.972 region:rollup2
WHEN I'M I'M DONE WITH OTHER

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:56.940 region:rollup2
FINANCE AGAIN.

00:52:54.972 --> 00:52:58.142 region:rollup2
I THINK WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.276 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR OF

00:52:58.142 --> 00:53:00.511 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:02.413 region:rollup2
FOR THE BEDS WE THINK THEY ARE

00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:03.781 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO SHOW THE COURT THAT

00:53:02.413 --> 00:53:05.883 region:rollup2
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS SO THAT

00:53:03.781 --> 00:53:06.483 region:rollup2
WE EVENTUALLY WHEN. YOU KNOW WE

00:53:05.883 --> 00:53:09.353 region:rollup2
ARE NOT UNDER COVER OF COCOA

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:10.854 region:rollup2
COURT OVERSIGHT WE WILL HAVE THE

00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:12.256 region:rollup2
NECESSARY LICENSE FADS.

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:14.391 region:rollup2
TO IT YOU KNOW HOPE OUR

00:53:12.256 --> 00:53:15.626 region:rollup2
PATIENTS I THINK ALSO MENTAL

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:16.560 region:rollup2
HEALTH PROJECTIONS ARE HARD.

00:53:15.626 --> 00:53:17.761 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO PROJECT WHAT OUR

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.496 region:rollup2
POPULATION IS GOING TO DO

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:20.964 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FIVE YEARS OUT. AND

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:22.766 region:rollup2
IT'S HOT IT'S.

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:23.767 region:rollup2
EASIER BUT SEE IT'S EASIER TO

00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:26.170 region:rollup2
USE

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:27.805 region:rollup2
HARDER TO RESTART A COP OUT LEE

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:29.773 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

00:53:27.805 --> 00:53:31.375 region:rollup2
AND I THAN IT IS TO.

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:32.576 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE STARTED AND WE A FEW

00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.777 region:rollup2
MORE YEARS I THINK IT'S REALLY

EVALUATION OF THE VIDEO

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:26.816 region:rollup2
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ON THE ONE

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:29.085 region:rollup2
YARD AT HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:31.054 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEING EVALUATED BY.

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:32.088 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS AT UC IRVINE AYE IT

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:36.125 region:rollup2
IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:36.493 region:rollup2
ARE LOOKING INTO ALLEGATIONS

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:36.926 region:rollup2
AGAINST STAFF.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.728 region:rollup2

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:40.563 region:rollup2
AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:42.932 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WITH HOLD ACTION ON

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:44.567 region:rollup2

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:54.544 region:rollup2
ON OTHER ACT.

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:56.145 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES IT'S DEVELOPING TO

ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT SACK

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:59.816 region:rollup2

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:07.991 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE OF THAT I

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:08.258 region:rollup2
MEAN I KNOW WE DID THE THE PILOT

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:09.726 region:rollup2
WITH THE.

01:07:08.258 --> 01:07:11.728 region:rollup2
HIGH DESERT AND ALL THAT.

01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:13.162 region:rollup2
AND THE RESULTS ARE NOT OUT YET

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:14.831 region:rollup2
I'M UNDERSTANDING ARE THEY

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:16.332 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE THE THEY ARE NOT

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:18.735 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE YET THE FINAL REPORT

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:19.269 region:rollup2
IS DUE TO US ARE RIGHT AT MAY

FIRST.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:24.340 region:rollup2
SOBRE CLOSED THE MAY REVISE.

01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:25.508 region:rollup2
WE WE HAVE SEEN SOME INITIAL

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.510 region:rollup2
RESULTS

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:28.278 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THE UC IRVINE

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:30.613 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS ARE LOOKING AT

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:32.048 region:rollup2
REALLY IS DIFFERENT THEN THEN

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:33.716 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION THAT EXISTS WITH

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:35.885 region:rollup2
THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:37.954 region:rollup2
THAT THE ALLEGATIONS INCLUDE

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:39.722 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE WHICH IS

01:07:37.954 --> 01:07:41.324 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO HIGH DESERT BUT WITH

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:42.692 region:rollup2
HOLDING THE FOOD AND A LOT OF

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:44.494 region:rollup2
OTHER TREATMENT. THAT THE UC

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:46.696 region:rollup2
IRVINE REPORT REALLY WON'T

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:48.865 region:rollup2
ADDRESS AND THIS IS OP A.

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:50.266 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT'S AT RISK AND WE

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:52.101 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THE VIDEO SYSTEM CAN

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:53.236 region:rollup2
HELP MAKE SURE THAT WHERE WE ARE

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:54.504 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THOSE ALLEGATIONS

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:55.905 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDING APPROPRIATE

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:57.340 region:rollup2
SERVICES SPECIFICALLY TO THAT

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.641 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:00.109 region:rollup2
WHAT IS WHAT IT WOULD IS THAT

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:01.477 region:rollup2
WHAT OF THE VIDEOS WITH THE HIGH

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.679 region:rollup2
DESERT GROUP DOING?

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.913 region:rollup2
AND NOT LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:05.014 region:rollup2
THINGS WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:07.717 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:08.785 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS INCIDENTS ARE A LOT OF

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:11.187 region:rollup2
ANY SORT OF VIOLENCE.

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:12.388 region:rollup2
THAT GOES ON TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:13.256 region:rollup2
CAPTURE THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:15.425 region:rollup2
WERE WE ARE.

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:18.695 region:rollup2
SHORTENING THE LENGTH OF

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:19.929 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE CAN.

01:08:18.695 --> 01:08:22.165 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATE

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:23.633 region:rollup2
CLAIMS OR OR CHARGES AGAINST THE

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:25.835 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE OFFENDER.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:27.203 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE OFTENTIMES OF TWO

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:28.538 region:rollup2
INMATES ARE TO FIGHT BUT NOBODY

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:30.039 region:rollup2
SEES THAT THEY'RE BOTH CHARGED

01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:31.474 region:rollup2
HE COULD ACTUALLY BE AN ASSAULT

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:33.543 region:rollup2
WHERE ONE INMATE IS A VICTIM. SO

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:35.712 region:rollup2
UC IRVINE IS FOCUSED MORE ON

01:08:33.543 --> 01:08:37.580 region:rollup2
THAT SIDE OF THE THE EQUATION

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:40.183 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT THE COST BENEFIT.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.817 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT THERE IS A RETURN

01:08:40.183 --> 01:08:41.951 region:rollup2
ON INVESTMENT IN INSTALLING THE

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:43.686 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.988 region:rollup2
AT SACK WE'RE REALLY DEALING

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:46.656 region:rollup2
WITH THE CARE AND APPROPRIATE

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:48.491 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO MENTAL HEALTH

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:49.859 region:rollup2
INMATES THEIR VERY MUCH AT RISK

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:51.294 region:rollup2
IN THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE NATURE

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:53.563 region:rollup2
OF THE ALLEGATIONS THE

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:54.897 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER THERE. MAKES

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:57.133 region:rollup2
IT A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAN.

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:59.469 region:rollup2
THE BROADER ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:08:57.133 --> 01:09:01.771 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT AT A HIGH DESERT AND

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:03.306 region:rollup2
A CCW OUT. THE OTHER PIECE THAT

01:09:01.771 --> 01:09:05.174 region:rollup2
CCW UP THE HIGH DESERT IS WERE

01:09:03.306 --> 01:09:06.809 region:rollup2
REALLY LOOKING AT THE TECHNOLOGY

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:08.478 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS HOW BEST TO USE THAT

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.345 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES OF WHO CAN LOOK AT

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:11.247 region:rollup2
VIDEO.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:12.615 region:rollup2
HOW LONG IS THE VIDEO RETAINED

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:14.550 region:rollup2
AND THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES SO

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:16.686 region:rollup2
THERE'S A A MUCH BROADER

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:19.455 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACT A?

01:09:16.686 --> 01:09:20.390 region:rollup2
AND STUDY GOING ON WITH THOSE

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:22.992 region:rollup2
TWO PRISONS.

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:23.926 region:rollup2
THAT DEAL WITH.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:27.497 region:rollup2
THEY POPULATION WEALTHY ON JUST

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:29.132 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.466 region:rollup2
OKAY ó WELL I THINK THE

01:09:29.132 --> 01:09:31.801 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:33.469 region:rollup2
US TO HAVE.

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:35.304 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE REPORT. IF

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:37.907 region:rollup2
WE'RE BUYING EIGHT EQUIPMENT I

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:39.075 region:rollup2
SOON. WOULD WOULD BASICALLY BY

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:40.710 region:rollup2
THE SAME TYPE OF EQUIPMENT EVEN

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:42.245 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE ANALYSIS THAT WHAT

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.945 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE VIDEO

01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:43.980 region:rollup2
MAY BE DIFFERENT.

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:45.615 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:47.183 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T THINK THE

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:49.285 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY SHOULD CHANGE THAT

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:51.254 region:rollup2
MUCH IN TERMS OF NUMBER WHAT ONE

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:51.888 region:rollup2
SEES IN THAT ROOM AND I THINK

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:52.155 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SEE IF

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:53.856 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

01:09:52.155 --> 01:09:56.225 region:rollup2
IF IT IS ACTUALLY WORKING OF THE

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:58.194 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS IS A IS EFFECTIVE

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:59.562 region:rollup2
IN IN. AND MONITORING WHAT WE

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.997 region:rollup2
THINK WE SHOULD BE MONITORING

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:01.164 region:rollup2
WHAT WE END UP WITH THE RESULTS

01:10:00.997 --> 01:10:03.766 region:rollup2
OF.

01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:05.802 region:rollup2
DENIAL OF FOOD OR VIEWS OR

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:07.537 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE I MEAN VIDEOS

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:09.572 region:rollup2
VIDEO UP CLEARLY AT WHAT YOU'RE

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:12.008 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR MAY CHANGE BUT. I

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:13.509 region:rollup2
ASSUME THAT THE IMAGES WILL NOT

01:10:12.008 --> 01:10:16.045 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN TERMS OF HOW WE.

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:17.680 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT TO MONITOR LEASE

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:19.382 region:rollup2
FACILITIES I ASSUME THAT'S

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.583 region:rollup2
CORRECT NO MA'AM THERE. WHAT

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:22.285 region:rollup2
WE'RE LEARNING FROM HIGH DOESN'T

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:23.953 region:rollup2
SEE SYRUPY AFT WITH CAMERA

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:25.288 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT HOME ARE HOW THE

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:27.023 region:rollup2
RECORDINGS ARE ACCESS TELLING

01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:28.958 region:rollup2
THEIR RETAIN ALL OF THAT WOULD

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:30.827 region:rollup2
BE ROLLED INTO THIS? SYSTEM AT

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:32.595 region:rollup2
CSP SACK THIS ONE WOULD BE

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:34.430 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY SMALLER IT'S ABOUT A

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:38.134 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE CAMERAS

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:40.369 region:rollup2
VERSUS A FULL IMPLEMENTATION AT

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:40.870 region:rollup2
A LOCATION LIKE SACRAMENTO WOULD

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.171 region:rollup2
BE CLOSER TO FIVE OR SIX

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:45.174 region:rollup2
HUNDRED.

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:50.113 region:rollup2
SO IT'S JUST THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:52.615 region:rollup2
AREAS MOMENT THE PS YUGIOH P.

01:10:50.113 --> 01:10:56.119 region:rollup2
TYPE AREAS AND FOR ALL RIGHT.

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:59.021 region:rollup2
WHAT IT YOU KNOW I'M A REAL BIG

01:10:56.119 --> 01:11:01.791 region:rollup2
STICKLER ABOUT DOE A STUDENT

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:07.497 region:rollup2
PILOTS AND AND THEN BEFORE WE

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:08.064 region:rollup2
FIND OUT WHAT THE PILOT SAID AS

01:11:07.497 --> 01:11:09.031 region:rollup2
WE IMPLEMENT SUPPLEMENTALS?

01:11:08.064 --> 01:11:09.599 region:rollup2
AND THOUGH I THINK PILOTS HAVE.

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:10.600 region:rollup2
A VALUE IN TEACHING US IN

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:11.634 region:rollup2
HELPING US TO MAKE GOOD

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.502 region:rollup2
DECISIONS APPS LA AS WELL AS BE

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:13.803 region:rollup2
FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AND NOT

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:14.470 region:rollup2
OVER DOING SOMETHING WHEN. THE

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:15.071 region:rollup2
PILOT BUT IT TOOK GIVEN TO SOME

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.239 region:rollup2
OF THE INFORMATION SO I THINK

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:16.839 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE OF A PILOT IS ALWAYS

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:20.776 region:rollup2
TO LEARN I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:22.211 region:rollup2
WE'LL GET

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:23.746 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:25.748 region:rollup2
FOR ME. IF I MAKING ONE MORE

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:26.382 region:rollup2
COMMENT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.517 region:rollup2
LEARNING SOME OF THOSE LESSONS

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:28.985 region:rollup2
ALL GOODY WITH HIGH DESERT WE

01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:30.653 region:rollup2
WILL QUALIFY THOSE WITH UC

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:32.722 region:rollup2
IRVINE WE'RE ACTUALLY EXPANDING

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:33.956 region:rollup2
THE THE. A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:35.625 region:rollup2
WE COLLECT AS WE'RE MOVING INTO

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:38.427 region:rollup2
CCW HAPPEN THE REST OF HIGH

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:41.364 region:rollup2
DESERT. THE SITUATION WITH THE

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:43.232 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH INMATES AT SAC IS

01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:44.801 region:rollup2
JUST MUCH MORE URGENT MA THAT

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:47.370 region:rollup2
CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT SPECIAL.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.937 region:rollup2
TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT THAT EXISTS

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.606 region:rollup2
IN A PS YOU AND A. S. YOU AT

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:51.908 region:rollup2
SAC.

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:52.842 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN URGENCY THERE TO

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:55.111 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE ARE ACTUALLY

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:56.579 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THOSE THOSE INMATES

01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:58.581 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDING THE TRANSPARENCY

01:11:56.579 --> 01:12:00.316 region:rollup2
THAT'S NECESSARY FOR OTHER FOLKS

01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:01.317 region:rollup2
TO VALIDATE THE.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.119 region:rollup2
CENTER FOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:05.188 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FROM. THE MEMBERS.

01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:06.355 region:rollup2
IT COMES FROM THE PUBLIC.

01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:08.457 region:rollup2

AND UNDER AND LEFT OPEN FOR.

01:12:16.299 --> 01:12:19.702 region:rollup2

BEFORE WE HAVE TO MAKE A FINAL

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:29.478 region:rollup2
