CALIFORNIA'S A FIFTY BILLION

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:05.915
DOLLAR AG INDUSTRY I WILL ASK MY

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:07.917
DISTRICT. IN A NUMBER OF YEARS

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:09.718
BACK IN THIS LEGISLATURE WE

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:12.488
PASSED A BILL THAT MANDATED THAT

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:14.490
SCHOOLS BY THEIR FRUIT CUPS

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:16.158
FROM. CALIFORNIA VENDORS IF

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.226
THEY'RE BUYING IT FROM FOLKS

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:18.661
FROM CHINA FROM OUT OF THE

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:20.796
COUNTRY SO. THAT IS THE QUESTION

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.932
FOR THE AUTHOR JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:08:22.998 --> 01:08:24.533
IN THE BILL THAT MANDATED BY

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.669
FROM CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE BIG

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:27.636

BECAUSE THE RULES AND

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.353
REGULATIONS THE PAST THREE

CLOSE. BUT IT IT REALLY COMES

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:56.031
WITH WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE

01:08:56.098 --> 01:08:56.599
FOR A FOOD MARKET WHERE FOR

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:57.700
INSTANCE- CARMEL BENNETT TRACTOR

01:08:57.766 --> 01:08:59.235
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH THAT

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:04.940
CHARGE CAN. USE ANYWHERE ELSE IN

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:06.575
THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. HOW

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:07.510
ARE FARMERS FOR TO COMPETE

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:08.477
BECAUSE THIS THIS ONE ARE TIED

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.279
BEHIND THEIR BACKS. CAL DOES.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.780
GOOD JOB OUT OF A SLUMP. IT

01:09:11.847 --> 01:09:13.349
IMPACT THAT WILL GIVE YOU

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:14.884
ANOTHER TO- A NUMBER OF YEARS

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.352
AGO ONE OF MY SENATE COLLEAGUES

01:09:16.418 --> 01:09:18.587
HAD A BILL. ON THE DAIRY ISSUE

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:19.755
TO BASICALLY DO AWAY WITH

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:21.524
CALLAS. WE PASSED A BILL THAT

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.725
HAS THE LOWEST ANTIBIOTICS

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.026
DINNERS IN THE COUNTRY THE

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.628
LOWEST. AND WE'RE ON THE VERGE

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.296
BEFORE A FEW YEARS BACK THE

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.164
FORCING OUR DAIRY HERDS. OUT OF

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:30.366
CALIFORNIANS BEING BROUGHT IN

FROM ELSEWHERE SO YOU KNOW WE

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.236
LOSE CONTROL OF THAT SO. MY

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.639
CONCERN IS HOW DO WE DO THAT ONE

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:38.874
IN SEVEN KIDS IN CALIFORNIA- FOR

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.743

AT THE END OF THE DAY- IT'S A

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:48.884
MATTER OF EQUITY AND I SEE A LOT

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.653
OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE MORE. WELL

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:51.487

HEALTHY SCHOOL LUNCHES. MY

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.512

THIS BILL AND- ON A COUPLE OF

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:51.800
THE POINTS OR RAISES ALL OF

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:52.935
EVERYONE RAISING SOME PRETTY

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:55.037
VALID CONCERNS HOWEVER. ON SOME

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.538
OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE OF THE

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:57.740
SOURCING OF FOOD I DON'T BELIEVE

01:12:57.806 --> 01:12:59.641
WE CURRENTLY HAVE A REQUIREMENT

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:00.876
THE FOOD COMING INTO OUR SCHOOLS

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:02.411
OUR SOURCE IN CALIFORNIA IF

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:04.446
SOMEONE WANTS TO WRITE A BILL

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.515
BILL ON THAT IN GENERAL THAT'S

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:07.583
SOMETHING WE CAN HAVE A MORE IN

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:08.784
DEPTH CONVERSATION ABOUT I THINK

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:09.852
THE SCHOOLS WITH. THE SCHOOL

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.120
DISTRICTS WOULD RAISE SOME

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:12.721
CONCERNS REGARDING COSTING ON

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.089
THAT BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:16.258
FAIR ARGUMENT OR ER DISCUSSION

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:17.793
TO HAVE SEPARATE FROM THIS

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.028
PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:21.497
DO IT ANYWAY WE DON'T REQUIRE

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:22.998
HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT. FOR OUR

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.466
FOOD SUPPLY RIGHT NOW COMING

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:26.001
INTO OUR SCHOOLS WIDELY WE

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.403
CREATE THAT REQUIREMENT FOR THIS

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.638
ONE PARTICULAR GRANT PROGRAM

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:31.206
WITH IT WHICH AGAIN IS NOT A

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:32.574
REQUIREMENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.977
CHOOSE TO OPT IN. SECONDLY IN

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:36.545
SANTA CLARA COUNTY WE STARTED A

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:38.280
PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO TO HAVE

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:39.882
A SALAD BARS WE STARTED OUR

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:41.784
MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS.

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:43.385
BUT WE FOUND- NOT ANECDOTALLY

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:45.120
BUT THE RESEARCH SHOWED IS THAT

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:46.688
THE KIDS ACTUALLY THE STUDENTS

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:48.791
ACTUALLY DID GRAVITATE TOWARDS

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.526
THE SOUTH WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:51.727
PARENT LOOKING OVER THEIR

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:52.728
SHOULDER. AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:53.962
THE OPTIONS THAT IT ACTUALLY

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:55.464
BECOMES A MEANINGFUL OPT FOR

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.866
THEM BUT THEY DO TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:58.867
OF THE DON'T HAVE PIZZA EVERY

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.869
DAY- BUT WHAT THEY DO WHAT DO

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:02.171
YOU DO FIND IS THAT THERE'S A

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:03.872
LOT OF PEER PRESSURE INVOLVED

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.340
THEY SEE OTHER FRIENDS AND FOLKS

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:06.542
IN THE SALADS. THEY START DOING

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.477

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:09.912
WAYS IN THAT REGARD OTHERS YOU

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.613
KNOW IT BUT ALWAYS I THINK THE

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.415
ISSUE OF WHO WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE

01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:14.750
OF CONCERN INCLUDING OUR SCHOOLS

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:16.819
BUT THAT'S ONE THING WE FOUND IN

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:17.619
SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE REGARD

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.421
FOR THE PLANT BASED MILKS IT'S

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:22.424
ABOUT CREATING NEW OPTIONS OF

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:24.893
RIGHT NOW OF MILK OF DAIRY MILK

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.697
ABOUT PROVIDING MORE OPTIONS NOT

FORCING ONE TYPE OF NUMBER

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.634

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:44.713
THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE TO HAVE

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:46.949

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.887
PUT PROGRAM BEING IN THE PROGRAM

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:52.788
ALLOWS OPERA FOR A TO REALLY

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:55.023
THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF FOOD

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.091
THAT'S COMING IN TO OUR SCHOOLS

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.492
ALLOW DISTRICTS TO APPLY FR

01:14:57.559 --> 01:14:59.595
GRANTS TO TRY ONE OF PROGRAMS

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.263
