INTRODUCE IN THIS- TO ME IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MUCH BETTER WHEN THERE'S COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THE TAKES CARE. AND ADDRESSES THE ISSUES OF WAGES AND- IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T FOLLOW THE WAGES YOU KNOW THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS INTERNAL PROCESS THERE SO- I BELIEVE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING A LOT MORE THAN JUST FOLLOWING A LOT OF LAWSUITS- SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THAT'S BEEN DONE HERE THANK. CRITICS UNDER ANY ANYBODY ELSE ANYTHING ELSE NO ONE ELSE WISHING TO BE RECOGNISED SENT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE SENATORS FOR YEAH JUST VERY QUICKLY WHEN CENTER DONE INTRODUCED THE BILL PASSED THE PAGA BILL. I CAN REMEMBER THAT WAS WHEN I WAS AROUND IN THOSE DAYS THE PURPOSE WAS WHERE. PLEASE SIR IN SITUATION LIKE THIS DIDN'T HAVE THE BENEFITS OF THE COLLECTIVE OF A UNION TO REPRESENT THEM. THE WHOLE THEORY BEHIND LABOR LAW IS THAT WE AS A STATE PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL. UNLESS OF COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL COOK WHO JOINS TOGETHER AND HAS A SUFFICIENT BARGAINING POWER TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. AND SO THIS COMPROMISE THAT'S HERE D. DRESSES WITH THIS RACE TO THE BOTTOM ISSUE ON THE ONE HAND. AND REALLY IN THIS UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES IN A COMPROMISE AT ALL.
