MIGHT BE OWN OCCUPANCY.

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:19.423
COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.291
ON EACH OF THOSE TOPICS PARKING

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.392
THERE ARE MANY JURISDICTIONS

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:23.027

THOUGH THAT SECTION OF LAW HAS

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.930

THAT'S PROBABLY TAPERED OFF A

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:15.579
LITTLE BIT BUT THERE WERE A LOT

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:16.447
OF REQUIREMENTS WELL ACTUALLY

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:18.215
SEA SALT LAW ALLOWS A

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:19.717
JURISDICTION. TO REQUIRE THE

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:20.584

CONCERNS THERE THE PEOPLE DIDN'T

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:25.556
RESIDE THERE ALL THE TIME OR IF

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:27.992
THEY WERE TO SELL THE PROPERTY.

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:29.994
THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE TO

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.729
FIND AN OWNER THAT WAS ALSO

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:33.564

JURISDICTIONS SAY IF.

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:43.440
THE PROPERTY OWNER DOES NOT

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:45.009
RESIDE IN THE SITE THE EIGHTY

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:48.846

SO -- THEY

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:01.525
DON'T HAVE TO BE AFFORDABLE BUT

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:02.827
ARE THERE INCENTIVES.

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:06.677
SEWER CONNECTION FEES.

AND THOSE MAY HAVE THE ABILITY

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:36.473
TO CAPTURE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.910
COST FOR INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:41.278
AND BY THE WAY WE WERE HAVING A

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:42.513
DISCUSSION THIS MORNING ABOUT

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:44.481
THE THAN THE NAME OF THIS --

00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:46.550

EXTRA SERVICES I THINK WE ALSO

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:49.053
NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:51.855
INFRASTRUCTURE IS IS A IS A BIG

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:52.189

00:44:52.256 --> 00:44:53.323
AS WELL.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.292
SO THERE'S ALWAYS A COST BASIS

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.594
FOR ANY OF THESE FEES OR RATES

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:59.096

DO NOT HAVE TO BE COST BASED.

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:09.073
SO OFFERED FOR SIMPLICITY I'M

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:10.207
JUST GOING TO BREAK THIS DOWN

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:12.543
INTO INTO THREE COMPONENTS --

00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:14.478

DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:18.615

USER AND REGULATORY FEES.

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:24.354

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:30.761
HURT THAT THIRD GROUP IS REALLY

IN A WAY A SUBSET OF OF THE

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:33.764

USER AND REGULATORY FEES THERE

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:45.409

FOR MANY DECADES NOW THE GENERAL

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:24.141
MANTRA HAS BEEN THAT DEVELOPMENT

INTO A A A TOWN.

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:33.250
THERE IS THERE IS A NEXUS THERE

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.252
IN TERMS OF THE MORE DEVELOPMENT

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.520
WOULD CREATE A NEED FOR MORE

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:37.921
PARKS.

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:40.891
MORE ROADS GREATER CAPACITY IN

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:29.006
SO THE THIRD CATEGORY WHICH WE

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:48.625
THEY OFFSET. TO SOME DEGREE

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:51.261
GENERAL RATE INCREASES FOR WATER

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:52.496
AND SEWER.

00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:54.931
RIGHT YOU CAN EITHER GET IT UP

00:48:54.998 --> 00:48:56.533
FRONT OR YOU CAN GET OVER TIME.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.568
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.304
OF FOUR FOUR THINGS WHEN IT

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.438
LOOKED WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:02.739
DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES ORCHID

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:04.007
FOR CONNECTION FEES.

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:05.375
IS THAT THEY MUST SHOW A NEXUS

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:06.677
OR CONNECTION.

00:49:06.743 --> 00:49:08.211
WHAT IS THE FEE CHARGED FOR AND

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:08.879
WHAT DO YOU GET?

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:09.946
YOUR MUST DEMONSTRATE

00:49:10.013 --> 00:49:11.381
PROPORTIONALITY AND THAT THE

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:13.050
COST WILL BE DOCUMENTED AND BE

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:14.151
PROPORTIONAL.

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.319
THEY NEED TO FOLLOW CERTAIN

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:18.088
PROCEDURES FOR ADOPTING AND

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:19.222
THERE'S A PROTEST PROCESS.

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:20.791
AND THEY MUST BE REASONABLE AND

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:23.760
SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP.

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:25.529
SO UNLIKE OFF SITE CAPITAL

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:27.631
PERMITS THERE ARE SITUATIONS

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:29.032
WHERE -- A

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:30.634
WATER UTILITY WILL ALSO CHARGE

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:33.136
SORT OF ON SITE CONNECTION FEES.

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:34.538
AND THE MOST TYPICAL ONE YOU SEE

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:35.439
IS -- IF

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:36.973
YOU'RE ADDING AN AD YOU ARE AN

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.909
ADDITIONAL UNIT THEY'LL CHARGE

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:40.410
I'M A METER FEE.

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:41.812
IN IN MANY COMMUNITIES THAT

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:43.246
METER FEE IS DRIVEN BY

00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:45.182
CONSERVATION.

00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:47.784
NOT NECESSARILY. TO YOU KNOW

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:49.886
KEEP OUT NEW UNITS IF YOU WELL --

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:51.121
THEY REALLY IN IN SOME

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:52.622
COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN THE

00:49:52.689 --> 00:49:54.524
MONTEREY AREA WATER IS SO DEAR

00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:55.559
THAT THEY'VE HAD.

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:57.461
THESE ADDITIONAL METERS

00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:59.930
REQUIREMENTS FOR MANY MANY YEARS.

00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:03.600
SO IT TO GET A LITTLE MORE GO

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:04.735
VERY BRIEFLY INTO HOW A

00:50:04.801 --> 00:50:06.737
CALCULATION CAN WORK FOR

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:08.572
CAPACITY FEE.

00:50:08.638 --> 00:50:10.207
SO IN THEIR SIMPLEST FORM THESE

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:11.775
CAPACITY FEES OR A SYSTEM

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.744
DEVELOPMENT CHARGES ART ART MAR

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.512
MERELY CALCULATED BY DIVIDING

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:17.280
THE COSTS ALLOCATED TO FUTURE

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:18.482
DEVELOPMENT BY THE NUMBER OF

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:20.183
UNITS OF NEW DEVELOPMENT

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.785
ANTICIPATED.

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:23.353
OVER A CERTAIN TIME FRAME.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.922
SO YOU CAN HAVE THE CASA PLAN

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:27.624
FUTURE FACILITIES IMPROVEMENTS.

00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:29.126
AND THEN LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.060
NEW UNITS.

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:31.328
SO -- THE

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:33.330
CAPACITY FEE REVENUES THEN

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.998
CANNOT BE USED FOR ANNUAL

00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:37.033
OPERATIONS SO THEY CANNOT BE

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.069
USED FOR THE PROVISION OF WATER

00:50:39.136 --> 00:50:40.604
SEWER THAT KIND OF THING.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:41.671
BUT THEY REALLY --

00:50:41.738 --> 00:50:43.440
ARE IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T

00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:44.908
EXCEED --

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:46.510
THE ACTUAL COST OF COURSE.

00:50:46.576 --> 00:50:48.945
SO THE METHODOLOGIES YOU CAN USE

00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:52.115
ARE EITHER ONE THE FIRST ONE IS.

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:53.683
LOOKING AT THE VALUE OF THE

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.752
SYSTEM IN PLACE NOW OR WHAT'S

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:58.455
CALLED THE HISTORICAL OR BY IN

00:50:58.522 --> 00:50:59.956
METHOD IF YOU WELL YOU'VE GOT A

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:01.391
SYSTEM.

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:02.826
AND YOU JUST DIVIDE THAT OUT.

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:06.396
THE OTHER OPTION IS TO LOOK AT

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:08.765
PLANNED INCREMENTAL GROWTH AND

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:11.034
INCREMENTAL UNITS WHETHER

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:12.769
THEY'RE NEW HOMES OR OR

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:14.971
HIGHRISES OR A OR A TO USE SO

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:15.605
YOU THAT'S CALLED THE

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:17.374
INCREMENTAL OR SYSTEM

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.642
DEVELOPMENT APPROACH.

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:19.976
AND THE LAST ONE IS A

00:51:20.043 --> 00:51:21.044
COMBINATION OF THE TWO

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:23.146
APPROACHES AND YOU SYNTHESIZE

00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:25.148
THE TWO TOGETHER --

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:26.583
THIS COMBINATION APPROACH

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.251
REQUIRES NEW CUSTOMERS TO PAY

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:29.853
BOTH THEIR FAIR SHARE OF

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.787
EXISTING.

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:31.988
SYSTEM ASSETS AS WELL AS THEIR

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:36.226
SH FUTURE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:37.594
NEEDED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:40.330
CAPACITY BASED ON THE FORECASTS

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:41.898
FOR THAT WATER SYSTEM.

00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.567
AS A RESULT THE NEW CUSTOMERS

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:45.101
CONNECTING WOULD ENTER AS EQUAL

00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:47.037
PARTICIPANTS.

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:48.638
AND WITH REGARD TO THEIR

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:50.607
FINANCIAL COMMITMENT AND OF

00:51:50.674 --> 00:51:51.708
OBLIGATION SEATED HILLARY.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.410
MANY LOCAL AGENCIES IN

00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:57.280
CALIFORNIA IF NOT ALL RELY ON A

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:58.982
NATIONAL PUBLICATION BY THE

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:01.151
AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION.

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:03.353
CALLED MANUAL M..

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.754
ONE IT'S WIDELY AVAILABLE AND

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.523
IT'S PROBABLY ON THE BOOKSHELF

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.325
OF ALMOST EVERY --

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:09.893
PRACTITIONER IN THE WATER RATES --

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:14.631
WORLD OR OR SOME TEN GENTLE AREA.

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:16.366
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW SOME

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:18.168
OF THESE FEES ARE CALCULATED

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:18.668
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:21.371
PROPORTIONAL BASED ON THEIR

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:23.607
TAXATION NO PUN INTENDED OF THE

00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:24.274
SYSTEM.

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:25.342
THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE BUYING

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:28.545
INTO OR OR CONNECTING UP --

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:30.180
TO ALL OF THESE FEES THAT I

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:31.882
MENTIONED REQUIRE A LOGICAL

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.850
ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO DETERMINE

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:35.252
THEIR COST BASIS.

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.753
THE LOOK THERE ARE LOCAL

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.222
VARIATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:40.757
BUT THEY SHOULD GENERALLY

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:42.492
REFLECT --

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:46.363
GENERALLY EXPECT ACCEPTED PRINT --

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:47.430
THROUGHOUT YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:48.765
THE STATE AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:50.100
THE UNITED STATES.

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:51.234
SO THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD THAT

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:53.069
I ASK MYSELF AS DOES DOES THE

00:52:53.136 --> 00:52:54.738
ADDITION OF AN EIGHTY YEAR

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.540
REQUIRE A NEW CONNECTION OR

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:57.974
MAYBE IT'S JUST A MERELY A TIE

00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:02.712
IN TO THE EXISTING LINE. TO THEY

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:04.581
MAIN AND NOT SUFFICIENT TO TAKE

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:05.849
CARE OF THE SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.918
AND EIGHTY YOU OR DO THEY NEED

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:08.785
TO UP SIZE.

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:10.120
SO THOSE SORT OF GRANULAR

00:53:10.186 --> 00:53:12.055
DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE --

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:12.989
ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS

00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:15.392
SOMETIMES.

00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:16.560
WILL A LARGER CONNECTION BE

00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:18.228
REQUIRED FOR ADDITIONAL LIVING

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.630
AREA IS A METER REQUIRED FOR ANY

00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:22.332
UNIT OR EIGHTY YOU.

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:24.367
WILL AND EIGHTY YOU GENERATE

00:53:24.434 --> 00:53:26.736
ADDITIONAL DEMAND FOR PARKS AND

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.438
SCHOOL FACILITIES.

00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:30.407
AND IF SO.

00:53:30.473 --> 00:53:32.542
WHO WILL PAY FOR THAT AND HOW

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:34.444
WOULD THOSE BE PAID?

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:36.313
FOR I'M THE TAKE AWAY THAT I DID

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:38.348
WANT YOU TO TO LEAVE WITH A

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:39.516
KNOWS A LOT OF INFORMATION SHORT

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:41.751
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:43.153
IS THAT --

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:45.855
THE FEES ARE SHOULD BE COST

00:53:45.922 --> 00:53:47.991
BASED -- IN

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:49.526
THE IN THEIR CALCULATION AND

00:53:49.593 --> 00:53:50.994
THEY SHOULD ALWAYS FOLLOW

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.763
GENERALLY ACCEPTED METHODOLOGIES.

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.065
USING -- THE

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:59.202
LOCAL COSTS AND ASSUMPTIONS.

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:00.704
SO THAT IS MY VERY QUICK

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.440
TREATISE OF A TOPIC THAT WE

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:04.975
USUALLY HAVE HOURS FOR SELF.

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:05.475
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:08.445
QUESTIONS.

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:10.680
THE DO IT DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:11.982
QUESTIONS TO HIM.

00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:14.985
I HAVE ONE THIS COMES OUT --

00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:17.821
ARE THERE DIFFERENCES HOW A CITY --

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:19.589
WILL SET RATES VERSUS A SPECIAL

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:22.192
DISTRICT.

00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:22.993
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I WAS

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.060
REVIEWING --

00:54:24.127 --> 00:54:25.362
GREG NECKLACES --

00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:27.030
A MEMO THAT HE JUST HANDED ME A

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:29.065
LITTLE BIT AGO THAT IN THEORY

00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:30.900
THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:33.670
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CITY EN

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.071
ESPECIAL DISTRICT.

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:36.906
BUT THERE ARE OFTEN DIFFERENCES

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:39.442
AND IN PRACTICE BECAUSE OF THE

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.845
ABILITY OF OF CONTROL AND LAND

00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:42.846
USE.

00:54:42.912 --> 00:54:44.247
AND THAT KIND OF THING BUT IN

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:45.515
THEORY A CITY IN A SPECIAL

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:46.950
DISTRICT SHOULD BE PROVIDING THE

00:54:47.017 --> 00:54:48.184
SAME.

00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:49.285
LEVEL OF SERVICE BUT A SPECIAL

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:53.757
DIS CANNOT CHARGE AN IMPACT FEE.

00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:55.759
IF THE CITY DOES NOT WANT TO

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:57.560
COOPERATE AND WE SEE THAT OFTEN

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:58.428
WITH.

00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:00.096
WE SHOULD UP WITH FIRE DISTRICTS

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.564
BUT IT CERTAINLY COULD BE.

00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:03.833
THE SAME WITH A A WATER DISTRICT

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.135
FOR EXAMPLE [inaudible]

00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:11.608
THANK YOU.

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:14.744
OKAY OUR NEXT SPEAKER WILL BE --

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:16.479
DAVID GARCIA.

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:17.814
FROM DAVID.

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:19.082
GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.250
HAVING ME THIS MORNING MY NAME

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:21.751
IS DAVID GARCIA I'M THE POLICY

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:23.987
DIRECTOR AT THE UC BERKELEY

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:25.255
TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:27.323
INNOVATION AND I'VE BEEN ASKED --

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:28.525
TO JOIN THIS HEARING THIS

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.427
MORNING TO DISCUSS SPECIFICALLY

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:31.795
WHAT WE KNOW FROM OUR RESEARCH

00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:34.798
ON EIGHTY USE WITH REGARDS TO

00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:37.333
FEES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT EIGHTY

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.135
USE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO PLAY

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:40.637
A SIGNIFICANT PART IN

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:42.138
ALLEVIATING THE STATE'S HOUSING

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:43.239
DEFICIT.

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:44.941
THEY ARE INHERENTLYLESS

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.042
EXPENSIVE TO BUILD THE ARE

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:47.410
DRIVEN BY INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:49.579
AND THEY FIT NEATLY INTO OUR

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:51.715
EXISTING LAND USE PATTERNS AND

00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:52.716
TO THAT LAST POINT.

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:54.250
OF THE TURNER CENTER ACTUALLY

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:56.453
RECENTLY RE RELEASED THE RESULTS

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.755
OF A YEARLONG STATEWIDE SURVEY

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:01.024
THAT EXAMINED VARIOUS LAND USE

00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:02.092
PRACTICES AND POLICIES

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:03.326
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:04.427
AND ONE OF THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:06.529
FROM THAT SURVEY IS THAT ABOUT

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:09.632
70% OF LAND IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:10.900
OWNED EXCLUSIVELY FOR SINGLE

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:11.935
FAMILY HOMES.

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:14.671
AND SO THANKS TO RECENT REFORMS

00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:16.372
TO EIGHTY USE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:17.774
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:19.375
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF NEW

00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:21.111
HOUSING IN THESE AREAS WITHOUT

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:22.746
OPENING UP A SINGLE ACRE OF NEW

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:26.015
LAND. TO DEVELOPMENT --

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:28.585
SO SO AGAIN I WAS AS WE HAVE

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:30.220
DONE AND WHAT WE CAN TELL WITH

00:56:30.286 --> 00:56:31.521
REGARDS TO FEES AND SO I

00:56:31.588 --> 00:56:32.722
APPROACH THIS QUESTION IN TWO

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:34.190
WAYS THE FIRST IS.

00:56:34.257 --> 00:56:35.725
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:37.127
CITIES ARE CHARGING --

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:39.629
HOMEOWNERS TO CREATE EIGHTY USE

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:40.363
AND FROM THERE WHAT ARE THE

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:42.766
IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FEES IN

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:45.235
OUR ABILITY TO BUILD THE

00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:46.703
STRUCTURES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.404
AND SO TO THE FIRST QUESTION WE

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:49.873
ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:50.874
INFORMATION ON WHAT'S USER

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.275
CHARGING AND WE DO KNOW THAT IT

00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:53.977
DOES VERY GREATLY DEPENDING ON

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:55.411
THE CITY AND COUNTY THAT.

00:56:55.478 --> 00:56:57.447
YOU ARE IN --

00:56:57.514 --> 00:56:58.481
THE SURVEY THAT I MENTIONED

00:56:58.548 --> 00:56:59.849
EARLIER --

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:02.152
INCLUDES A WHOLE SECTION ON

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:02.986
EIGHTY YOU POLICIES AND

00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:05.054
PRACTICES INCLUDING A QUESTION

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:07.056
ON WHAT LOCALITIES ARE CHARGING

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:07.791
HOMEOWNERS.

00:57:07.857 --> 00:57:09.359
FOR CALM EXCUSE ME FOR EIGHTY

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:10.293
USE.

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.628
AND FROM THE RESPONSES WE

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:14.464
RECEIVED FROM THIS QUESTION WE

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:15.865
KNOW THAT THE MEAN.

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:18.001
AMOUNTS CHARGE PER UNIT FOR AN

00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:20.703
EIGHTY YOU IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.271
EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:21.538
DOLLARS.

00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:25.708
AND EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED

00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:26.643
AND FURTHERMORE WE KNOW THAT

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:28.111
ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR

00:57:28.178 --> 00:57:30.413
RESPONDENTS NOTED THAT THEY

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.415
CHARGE MORE THAN FIFTEEN

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:33.349
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:36.452
PER EIGHTY YOU WE ALSO --

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:38.121
WE ALSO SAW A FEW EXAMPLES OF

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:39.255
CITIES REPORTING THAT THEY

00:57:39.322 --> 00:57:40.857
CHARGE UPWARDS OF FORTY THOUSAND

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:42.826
DOLLARS PER UNIT AND SOME CLOSE

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:43.893
TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.495
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:47.564
THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.766
SURVEY REFLECT ONLY RESPONSES

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:50.967
FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES AND

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:52.202
WHAT THEY CHARGE.

00:57:52.268 --> 00:57:55.772
AND SO ANY CHARGES THAT ARE LEVY

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.240
SIX OR TO THE DISTRICTS FOR

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:58.808
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THOSE ARE NOT

00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:00.109
REFLECTED IN THE NUMBERS THAT WE

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:01.578
SAW IN THE SURVEY.

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:03.079
AND AS A RESULT --

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:04.747
HOMEOWNER WHO IS GOING TO THE

00:58:04.814 --> 00:58:06.716
EIGHTY PROCESS NOW IS ALMOST

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:08.651
CERTAINLY EXPERIENCING HIGHER

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:09.819
FEES WILL WE HAVE REPORTED.

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.287
ANOTHER INTERESTING TAKE AWAY

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:13.056
FROM OUR SURVEY IS THAT THE

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:14.991
QUESTION REGARDING WHAT

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.793
LOCALITIES ARE CHARGING FOR USE.

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.828
WAS BY FAR THE HAD THE LOWEST

00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:20.163
RESPONSE RATE OF ANY QUESTIONS

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:21.764
IN THE EIGHTY YOU SECTION ONLY

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:23.867
ABOUT 50% OF RESPONDENTS CHOSE

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.068
TO PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR THAT

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:27.170
QUESTION WHICH PERHAPS TELLS US

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:28.104
THE CITY'S DON'T NECESSARILY

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:30.006
HAVE A A GOOD FEEL. FOR WHAT

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:30.940
THEY'RE CHARGING FOR THE

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:33.009
SPECIFIC TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT AND

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:34.677
THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:35.211
ANSWER THE QUESTION ON OUR

00:58:35.278 --> 00:58:37.413
SURVEY.

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.414
AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:39.916
QUESTION TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:41.251
WE DO KNOW THAT --

00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:43.453
FEES CAN MANY TIMES BE A

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.188
SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO A

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:47.290
HOMEOWNER LOOKING TO BUILD A

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:48.992
UNIT IN THEIR BACKYARD.

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:51.027
AGAIN AT USE OUR INHERENTLY LESS

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:52.762
EXPENSIVE TO BUILD HOWEVER IF

00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:54.464
THEY ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR FEES

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.432
THAT'S SAY A SINGLE FAMILY HOME

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:57.667
OR AN APARTMENT UNIT MAY BE

00:58:57.734 --> 00:58:58.701
SUBJECT.

00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:00.436
TO THAN A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:02.572
OF THAT PROJECTS BUDGET IS GOING

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:05.508
TO GO GOING TO DEVICES

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:08.111
HOMEOWNERS FROM PURSUING --

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:08.711
THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN EIGHTY

00:59:08.778 --> 00:59:09.445
YOU.

00:59:09.512 --> 00:59:10.780
KNOW WE HAVE PLENTY OF EVIDENCE

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:12.548
THAT SHOWS THAT IN PLACES WHERE

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:13.983
EIGHTY YOU FEES HAVE BEEN WAIVED

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:14.984
OR LOWERED.

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:17.587
THAT A INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:19.022
AND CONSTRUCTION PERMITS SOON

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:20.590
FOLLOWS A FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:23.226
CITY OF PORTLAND. TWENTY TEN

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:24.494
THAT CITY RECOGNIZE THIS

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.062
IMBALANCE AND DECIDED TO WAIVE

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:27.830
THEIR EIGHTY YOU FEES AND IN SUB

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:29.499
SCHOOL YEARS SAW --

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:30.867
OF SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:32.135
AMOUNT OF EIGHTY USE THEIR TO

00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:34.504
THE POINT WHERE IN.

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:35.071
TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CITY OF

00:59:35.138 --> 00:59:38.241
PORTLAND ISSUED MORE PERMITS FOR

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:40.643
EIGHTY USE THAN SINGLE FAMILY

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:41.577
HOMES IN THAT CITY.

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:43.112
WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF THIS IN

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:44.747
CALIFORNIA AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE

00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:46.215
SANTA CRUZ IN --

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.250
TWENTY FOURTEEN IN ADDITION TO

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:48.718
SEVERAL OTHER EIGHTY REFORMS ARE

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:50.520
THEY LOWER THEIR FEES AND HAVE

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:51.921
SINCE SEEN AN INCREASING USE

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:53.222
THAT COMMUNITY AS WELL.

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:55.158
MORE RECENTLY THE CITY OF SAN

00:59:55.224 --> 00:59:56.092
DIEGO.

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:58.194
LAST SPRING SIGNIFICANTLY

00:59:58.261 --> 01:00:00.596
REDUCED THEIR IMPACT FEES FOR

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:02.665
YOU TO USE A GOING FROM --

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:08.638
BETWEEN 240-002-29000RADIO DOWN

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.273
280-002-13000 DOLLARS PREVIEW.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.441
AND STAFF THEIR NOTES THAT SINCE

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:12.976
HIS REFORM WAS ENACTED EIGHTY

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:14.510
YOU APPLICATIONS HAVE INCREASED

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.112
SO THESE THESE ARE JUST TWO

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:17.146
EXAMPLES --

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:19.215
I THINK WE WILL HEAR ABOUT A FEW

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:20.316
MORE -- OF

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.751
CITIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:22.318
HAVE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.087
BALANCE THE NEED FOR MORE

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.522
HOUSING WITH THE AMOUNT OF FEES

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:30.360
THEY CHARGE FOR EIGHTY USE SO.

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:31.461
AGAIN WE KNOW THAT FEES ARE

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:32.829
OFTEN TIMES CITED BY HOMEOWNERS

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:35.131
AS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER --

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:35.698
FOR WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:37.834
DECIDE TO BE.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.036
AND IN PLACES WHERE WE SEE

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:42.472
DECREASES OR WAIVERS FOR FEES WE

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:43.873
DO SEE AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.141
OF THOSE PLACES SO --

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.810
I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THANK

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:48.945
YOU AGAIN FOR TAKING TIME TO

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:51.514
EXAMINE THIS TOPIC AND I LOOK

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:54.984
FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSION.

01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:56.319
SO AMERICA EXCELLENT.

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:57.587
ON THE EITHER COUNTIES OR CITIES

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.455
THAT LOWERED THEIR FEES WAS THAT

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:03.559
A COUNTY OR A CITY DECISION --

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.762
SO.

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.330
THE SURVEY REFLECTS RESPONSES

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:10.166
FROM EITHER A CITY OR COUNTY OR

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:10.800
IN INSTANCES WHERE THE CITY IS

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:11.667
THE COUNTY --

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:13.703
AND SO IN IN THOSE INSTANCES IT

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.538
WOULD BE CITIES REPORTING THEIR

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:17.407
OWN FEES THAT THEY CHARGE FOR A

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:18.741
TO USE AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:19.876
THEY HAVE DECIDED TO LOWER THOSE

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:21.978
FEES THAT WOULD BE --

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.146
FOR THE FEES THOSE CITY

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:24.480
SPECIFICALLY CHARGED THERE MAY

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:25.882
BE OTHER FEES AT THE COUNTY

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:27.316
CHARGES OR PERHAPS --

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:28.918
OTHER DISTRICTS CHARGE THAT THE

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:30.353
CITY DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.088
CONTROL OVER THAT THOSE HE'S MAY

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:32.588
STILL EXIST [inaudible]

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:34.590
THANK YOU.

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.559
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:37.493
MISTER SEE FOR YOUR YOUR

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.661
COMMENTS IN FOR KNOWLEDGE IN THE

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:39.862
CITY SAN DIEGO AND THE WORK THAT

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:40.663
THEY'RE DOING TO THEM TO TO LEAD

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.864

SERENA TAKE THAT.

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:47.296
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE LEARNED FOR

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:49.231
THE REBUILD PROCESS APPLY THAT

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:50.699
TO EIGHTY USE TO TURN THOSE

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:51.867
AROUND QUICKER SO WE'RE TRYING

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:52.768
TO ADDRESS IT FROM MULTIPLE

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:54.136
FRONTS WAS ON THE FEES.

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:56.105
THE PROCESS AND BUT STILL TRY TO

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.673
HAVE ADDRESSED AFFORDABILITY

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.008
ELEMENT TO IT SO THAT'S

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.576
ESSENTIALLY HOW WERE WERE

RESPONSE.

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:06.081
ON THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.950
THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION IS

01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:12.221
THAT --

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:12.822
SOMEBODY OUTSIDE AGENCIES YOU

01:08:12.888 --> 01:08:13.556
TALKED ABOUT THE SCHOOL.

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:16.225
BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOR THEIR

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.427
TEACHERS AND STAFF THAT THEY

01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:19.562
HAVE ASKED ME TO COME PRESENT TO

01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:20.529
THE SCHOOL BOARD BECAUSE THEY

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:21.764
WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:22.698
IN TO SEE IF THEY CAN MODEL

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.767
SOMETHING OFF OF WHAT WE DID

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:25.901
LOCALLY TO APPLY TO THEIR SCHOOL

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:27.536
DISTRICT FEES SO --

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:29.171
THEY'RE STARTING THERE'S OTHER

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.005
PLAYERS ARE STARTING TO GET

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:31.273
INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION I

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.175
THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.945
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:36.545
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.180
ANY QUESTIONS. ONE QUESTION I I

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.516
THINK THAT'S A GREAT STORY.

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:41.584
OUR HOUSING COMMITTEE WERE

01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:42.585
LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY HOLDING A

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:43.953
FUTURE HEARING ABOUT WHAT

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.721
REBUILDING AFTER WILDFIRES LOOKS

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.023
LIKE SO WE MAY BE IN TOUCH WITH

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:49.792
YOU ON THAT --

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:50.993
TELL US WHAT YOUR COST RECOVERY

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.328
LOOKS LIKE IF YOU AREN'T RECOUP

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.096
IN A FEES HOW ARE YOU ABLE.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.331
HOW MUCH OF YOUR COSTS ARE YOU

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.932
ACTUALLY GETTING BACK HOW YOU

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:58.501
PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE?

01:08:58.567 --> 01:08:59.568
RATE SAYS YOU HEARD THAT TO TWO

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:00.135
DIFFERENT FEES ONE IS THE

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:02.171
PERMITTING FEE AND ONE IS THE

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.672
IMPACT FEES THE FEES WE REDUCE

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:05.274
FOR THE IMPACT FEES WHICH WAS

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.609
THE BIG DOLLAR AMOUNT --

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:08.277
IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WHAT HAPPENS

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:10.112
IS YOU CAN HAVE A HOME AND YOU

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:11.347
CAN DO A THREE HUNDRED SQUARE

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:13.015
FOOT ADDITION TO YOUR HOME.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:13.849
AND PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THAT HOME

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:15.117
SO WE TOOK THE APPROACH THAT IF

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:16.852
IT'S A SMALLER UNIT --

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:18.387
THAT THAT PRIMARY RESIDENCE PAID

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:19.822
THAT IMPACT FEE THEY PAID THE

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:20.656
FULL IMPACT VIEW OF THAT

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:22.925
ORIGINAL HOUSE SO THAT IMPACT IS

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.193
BEING ADDRESSED --

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:26.529
BY ADDING A FEW MORE PEOPLE TO

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:27.162
SAY TO PEOPLE WITHIN A SQUARE

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:28.831
FOOT -- UNIT

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:30.366
THAT IMPACT IS INSIGNIFICANT IN

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:31.467
THE SKIN THE SCHEME OF THE

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:32.868
OVERALL SYSTEM AND SO THAT'S THE

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:33.869
APPROACH WE TOOK AGAIN WE WERE

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:35.671
FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE ON IT --

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:38.841
WE HAD TO MAKE THAT CALL --

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:42.611
BUT ANY UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED PER

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:43.546
STATE LAW --

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.347
BUT ANYTHING OVER A HUNDRED

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:46.415
SQUARE FEET WE INCREMENTALLY

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:47.816
STEPPED UP THE FEE TO TRY TO

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:49.051
ACCOMMODATE THAT ADDITIONAL

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.286
IMPACT TO THE SYSTEM AS YOU

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.253
HEARD EARLIER.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.755
SO IT BETWEEN SEVEN OR FIFTY TO

01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:54.657
A THOUSAND IT'S 25% OF THE

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:57.126
ANYTHING. THOUSAND OF TWELVE

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.360
HUNDRED WE DID 50% FEE.

01:09:58.427 --> 01:09:59.428
AGAIN THAT WAS TO TRY TO RECOUP

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.363
SOME OF THOSE COSTS TO THE TO

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.964
YOUR POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:02.798
WE'RE NOT.

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:03.799
PUSHING ASIDE THE NEEDED

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.367
IMPROVEMENTS FOR PARKS AND ROADS

01:10:05.434 --> 01:10:07.636
AND IT CAN ACTIVITY THAT WE NEED

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:11.006
OUR COMMUNITY.

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:11.941
ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.075
I HAVE A FEW.

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:13.909
I WANNA THANK YOU --

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:15.511
IF YOU ONLY KNEW WHAT HE'S BEEN

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:16.478
THROUGH.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:17.813
AND HOW THEY'VE GOTTEN THIS A

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.981
COMMUNITY BACK ON THEIR FEET

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.716
SLOWLY BUT SURELY SO THANK YOU

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:21.917
FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND TIME

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.018
AND FRUSTRATION.

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.820
I UNDERSTAND THAT --

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.288
SO COUPLE QUESTIONS I HAVE DO

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:27.389
YOU THINK THAT EVERY

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:29.558
JURISDICTION CAN DO THIS AS

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.060
ORDERED AS A DEPEND ON WHETHER

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.562
WATER SEWER IS DONE IN HOUSE.

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:35.030
OR RATHER THAN PROVIDED BY

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:36.799
SPECIAL DISTRICT IT'S A GREAT

01:10:36.865 --> 01:10:38.601
QUESTION WE WE WE DO HAVE WATERS

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:41.303
OR IN HOUSE IN THE CITY --

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:44.673
WE THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG AS WE

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:45.274
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THIS FEE

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:46.709
STRUCTURE --

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:48.143
WITH JUST PARK AND AND OUR

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.712
CAPITAL FACILITY FEES WHICH IS

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:50.879
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:52.548
IT TOOK US ABOUT TWO MONTHS MORE

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:53.048
TO WORK WITH THE WATER

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.483
DEPARTMENT TO FIND A SOLUTION

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:55.751
THAT WOULD WORK FOR THEM AS YOU

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:56.885
HEARD THERE'S PROP TWO EIGHTEEN

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:58.187
AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WE HAD

01:10:58.253 --> 01:10:59.488
TO BE AWARE OF OUR BE BE

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:00.956
CONCERNED ABOUT --

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:02.491
BUT WE FINALLY GOT THERE FOUND A

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:03.459
SOLUTION THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:04.827
WORK SO WE DID --

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:06.295
LOOK AT THE SMALLER UNITS

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:07.997
ANYTHING OVER SEVEN FIFTY SQUARE

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:08.998
FEET THOSE WATERS OR IF YOU

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:11.000
START TO KICK AND THE OTHER

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.368
THING WE WORKED WITH HIM ON IS

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:14.336
THAT THE SMALLER UNITS WE DON'T%

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:15.871
REQUIRE SEPARATE CONNECTION.

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:16.905
A SEPARATE METER AGAIN THAT WAS

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:18.540
AN ADDED COST TO HOMEOWNERS

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.142
WHICH IS FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.077
ALMOST DOUBLES THE FEE SO WHEN

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:22.811
YOU GET INTO THE ROADWAY AND

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:24.647
START PUTTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:25.247
IN METERS.

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:26.882
THAT IT ISN'T A BIG COST BUT

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:27.983
THERE IS A DISCUSSION TO HAVE

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.551
BECAUSE THERE'S A BIG PUSH FOR

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:30.919
WATER CONSERVATION AND SEPARATE

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:31.820
MEETING IN THERE'S A VALUE TO

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:32.521
THAT.

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:34.123
BUT OUR PRIORITY FOR OUR CITY

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:36.458
WAS BRINGING HOUSING STOCK TO

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:37.793
OUR COMMUNITY AND QUICKLY.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.261
WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB TRYING TO

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:40.162
DO THAT AND WHAT PROCESS WOULD

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:41.230
YOU RECOMMEND TO OTHER

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:44.400
JURISDICTIONS THEY'RE LOOKING --

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:49.038
TO EXPEDIA AT THE EIGHTY YOU.

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:49.571
CONSTRUCTION WITHIN THEIR

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.273
BOUNDARIES.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.875
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD CHALLENGES AND

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:55.277
HE WAS SOME IDEAS.

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:57.012
I THINK THE ONE IS TO TO REACH

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:58.180
OUT TO COMMUNITY FIRST BECAUSE

01:11:58.247 --> 01:11:59.381
IT DOES TAKE COMMUNITY INPUT --

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:00.582
SETBACKS AND PARKING OR ARE VERY

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.117
REAL THINGS TO INDIVIDUALS IN

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:02.985
THEIR HOMES.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.620
PEOPLE PUSH BACK ON IF AS A

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:05.988
REDUCE PARKING MORE PARKING ON

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:07.523
THE STREET THAT THAT BECOMES A A

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:10.459
TOPIC -- BUT

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:11.293
I THINK THERE'S THERE'S AN A

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.628
PEOPLE EMBRACE THE CONCEPT OF

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:15.197
PROVIDING THIS --

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:17.700
FOR RIGHT REASONS I THINK WHAT

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:19.168
WE RECOMMEND IS --

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:22.538
OF DO LOOK AT THE FEE STRUCTURE --

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:24.006
IT YET YEAH I THINK I THINK BE

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.474
BOLD TRY THINGS IF IT DOESN'T

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:26.308
WORK FIX IT AND I THINK THAT'S

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.776
OUR AND HAS BEEN OUR MODEL

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:29.044
THROUGH THE ENTIRE REBUILD WE

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:30.179
DON'T THERE'S NO PLAYBOOK FOR

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:31.513
THIS WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.648
FIGURE HIS OUT AS WE GO WE WERE

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:33.449
TRYING.

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:34.149
THINGS IF IT DOESN'T WORK WE

01:12:34.216 --> 01:12:35.084
TWEAK IT AND THEY'RE BACK TO

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.518
COUNCIL WE TWEAK IT AND WE KEEP

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:37.386
CHANGING IT.

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:39.088
UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT BUT IF WE

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:40.355
JUST STOP AND WAIT UNTIL WE GET

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:41.990
SOMETHING PERFECT NOTHING WILL

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:43.058
HAPPEN AND I DON'T THINK

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.727
ANYTHING WILL MOVE FORWARD SO.

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:49.832
MY MY ADVICE TO JUMP IN AND AND

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:50.733
TRY SOMETHING AMEN [inaudible]

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:53.001
THE YEAH IT ARE THERE ANY OTHER

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:54.803

SO OUR WATER DISTRIBUTION --

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.799
AND INFRASTRUCTURE AS YOU MIGHT

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:58.433
IMAGINE IS EXTENSIVE WE'VE GOT

01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.501
YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF MILES OF

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:00.702
DISTRIBUTION PIPE --

HUNDREDS OF PUMPING PLANTS

RESERVOIRS AND THE WASTE WATER

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:05.240
DECIDED HOUSE WHAT WE DON'T ON

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:07.176
THE COLLECTION SYSTEM WE OWN THE

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:08.343
LARGE INTERCEPTORS THAT THOSE

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:09.745
CONNECT TO AND THE TREATMENT

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.346
FACILITIES THAT ACTUALLY

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:12.281
ULTIMATELY DISCHARGED INTO THE

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:13.749
BAY -- AND

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:14.616
OUR REVENUE STREAM --

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:15.651
AS TIM HAD ALSO MENTIONED IS

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:16.919
DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF A A CITY

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:18.353
OR A COUNTY THAT WE RELY

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.322
PRIMARILY ON THE RATES AND FEES

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:21.490
THAT WE CHARGE.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:22.357
AND ALL THOSE OF COURSE ARE IN

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.226
ACCORDANCE WITH A PROP TO

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.928
EIGHTEEN AND PROP TO EIGHT DOT

01:14:25.994 --> 01:14:26.461
TWENTY SIX NOW PART OF OUR

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:27.696
CONSTITUTION --

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.198
AND AND SO FORCE REFLECTING THE

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:31.366
COST OF SERVICE SO THOSE ARE THE

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.734
REFUSE THAT WE USE THIS COUNTRY

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:33.702
TO MAINTAIN TO UPGRADE OUR

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:34.903
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO MEET

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.406
FUTURE SUPPLY DEMANDS.

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:40.242
SO -- THE

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:40.809
CONNECTION CAPACITY CHARGES

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.644
AREN'T --

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:44.046
AND AGAIN DAVID THANK YOU FOR

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.080
MENTIONING THAT YOU KNOW YOU

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:45.981
HAVE TO REALLY SIT DOWN WITH

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:47.549
WITH WATER AND SEWER BECAUSE

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:49.718
THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT COSTS --

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:51.153
AND YOU MAY ASK WHAT WE MEAN

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.020
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.455
INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:54.656
FOR THE WATER SUPPLY TO SERVE

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.325
NEW DEVELOPMENT SO ESSENTIALLY

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:58.694
OUR MAJOR GOAL IS TO BE THERE

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.062
FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS OUR NUMBERS

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:01.396
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.131
ARE THOSE FACILITIES AND ALL THE

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:04.466
WATER SUPPLY AND EVERYTHING IS

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:05.701
THERE SO THAT WE'RE NOT A

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:06.335
HINDRANCE TO GROWTH THAT WERE.

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:07.936
REALLY THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:09.371
WE MEET THAT FUTURE DEMAND AND

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:10.839
WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:11.974
THAT FUTURE DEMAND --

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.141
IS ACCOUNTED FOR WHEN WE MAKE

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:16.645
OUR OUR PLANS AND CONSIDER

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:17.246
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:18.180
SYSTEM.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.882
SO EXAMPLES OF THAT MEANS --

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:21.316
LOOKING AT SUFFICIENT STORAGE

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:22.751
CAPACITY WATER SUPPLIES PUMPING

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:24.052
CAPACITY --

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:26.088
OVER SIZING IN SOME CASES OF

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:27.022
DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:28.190
PIPELINES OF WE KNOW THERE'S

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:28.991
BEEN A GROWTH IN IN CERTAIN

01:15:29.057 --> 01:15:31.093
AREAS --

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:31.660
COORDINATING WITH THE CITIES

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:34.830
THAT ARE IN OUR EFFICIENT --

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:37.699
AT ALL TIMES OF DAY --

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:38.500
AND NIGHT --

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:40.235
BUT SIMPLY MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:41.103
HAVE ENOUGH TO MEET OUR PRESENT

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.504
IT OBVIOUSLY ISN'T ENOUGH WE

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:43.739
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:45.173
ENOUGH PRESSURE TO THE SYSTEM --

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.909
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FIRES

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:49.211
FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT'S NOT AN

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:51.313
INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE FOR US --

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.314
AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE DIRECT

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:53.715
EXPERIENCE WITH DEVASTATING FIRE

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:55.050
IN OUR SERVICE AREA THE OAKLAND

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:57.286
HILLS FIRE EVEN TODAY IS.

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:59.021
CONSIDERED THE THIRD WORST FIRE

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.822
IN STATE HISTORY IN TERMS OF

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:02.190
LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY.

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:04.726
SO ANY NEW DEMAND ON OUR SYSTEM --

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.395
IS IS SUCH THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.562
SURE THAT WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:09.231
THE SUPPLY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:10.699
SERVE THAT AND THAT COSTS MONEY.

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:11.833
AND SO --

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:12.868
FOR US CONNECTION FEES AND

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:13.802
CAPACITY CHARGES ARE

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:15.037
FUNDAMENTALLY A PART OF A READ

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:16.772
AFFORDABILITY SO THAT'S KIND OF

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:18.674
THE NEXUS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE --

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:19.875
THEY REALLY HELP TO ENSURE THAT

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.176
THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.778
DEVELOPMENT ARE ACTUALLY PAYING

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:24.146
THE COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:25.347
WITH --

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.449
SERVING THAT DEVELOPMENT --

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.083
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T RECOVER

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:30.285
THE COSTS FROM --

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:32.087
FROM THOSE FEES AND CHARGES WELL

01:16:32.154 --> 01:16:33.789
ESSENTIALLY RATES ARE GOING TO

01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:34.856
HAVE TO PAY FOR IT I MEAN AS TIM

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.591
HAD SAID EARLIER THE IT'S ONE OR

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:37.392
THE OTHER.

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:39.461
AND IN OUR CASE A SIGNIFICANT

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:40.429
PORTION OF OUR RATE BASIS LOW

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:41.964
INCOME WE ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:43.398
THAT ONE THIRD OF OUR SERVICE

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:45.801
AREAS LIVING AT TUNER PERCENT OR

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.936
BELOW THE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:48.570
LIMIT.

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:50.005
SO AN ARC FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:51.173
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO BURDEN

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.607
OUR REPAIRS PARTICULARLY OUR LOW

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.843
INCOME REPAIRS GIVEN PROP TWO

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:55.711
EIGHTEEN AND OTHER --

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.145
LONG EFFECT WITH THE COST OF NEW

01:16:57.212 --> 01:16:57.813
DEVELOPMENT.

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.081
SO -- AT

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:00.282
PRESENT IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:01.783
LAW WE DO NOT CHARGE CAPACITY

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:03.418
FEES FOR EIGHTY USE UNLESS THE

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:03.986
SEPARATE STRUCTURE IS BEING

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:06.421
ADDED AND IF THAT SEPARATE

01:17:06.488 --> 01:17:07.723
STRUCTURE ASKS IF THEY WANT TO

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.024
THAT IS ASKS US TO INCREASE

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:10.525
CAPACITY TO THEIR PARTICULAR

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:11.293
PROPERTY.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.061
SO EVER PROPERTY OWNER

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:14.429
APPROACHES US WITH A NEW

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:15.664
STRUCTURE TERRORISTS IF IT'S YOU

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:16.698
KNOW INSIDE THE FOOTPRINT GREAT

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:17.966
NO PROBLEM --

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:18.834
BUT IF THEY PURCHASE NAY SAY

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:19.735
WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING A NEW

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.403
STRUCTURE AND WE THINK WE MIGHT

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.838
NEED SOME ADDITIONAL CAPACITY

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.006
WILL LOOK AT IT AND WILL EITHER

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:25.073
SAY ACTUALLY WE THINK YOU'RE

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.375
FINE ZERO YOU'RE GOOD DON'T

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:27.142
WORRY ABOUT IT.

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.410
OR WELL --

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:29.578
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU FOR WHATEVER

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:30.846
REASON YOU WANT TO A FIRE

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.481
SPRINKLER SYSTEM IN THAT UNIT

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:33.482
IT'S NOT REQUIRED BY LAW BUT YOU

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:34.950
WANT IT AND SO YOU'VE GOT A

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.852
REALLY OLD YOU KNOW FIVE EIGHT

01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:37.519
CENTS LINE.

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:41.223
AS DAVID MENTIONED DIGGING INTO

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:45.327
THIS THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE AND SO --

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.828
WE WILL CHARGE THEM TO PUT IN A

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.497
NEW LINE AND TO PUT IN A NEW

01:17:48.563 --> 01:17:49.664
METER AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.333
SECOND COST AND THEN LET'S SAY

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.834
WELL YOU KNOW ACTUALLY WHAT

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:54.503
WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.470
ADDING A HOUSE THAT IS ABOUT THE

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:56.738
SAME SQUARE FOOTAGE IS THE

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.006
ORIGINAL HOUSE.

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:58.774
THAT'S FINE TOO BUT WE'LL JUST

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.509
LOOK AT WHAT SIZE LINE DO YOU

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:02.310
REALLY NEED AND IF YOU ALREADY

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:03.879
HAVE YOU KNOW A FIVE EIGHTHS

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:05.080
INCH LINE YOU WE CENTURY JUST

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.782
CHARGE YOU THE INCREMENTS UP TO

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:07.949
THE NEXT SIZE --

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.418
FOR CAPACITY SO THAT'S HOW IT'S

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:11.520
ACTUALLY WORKING IN IN PART AND

01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:12.521
CURRENT PRACTICE AND ALL THOSE

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.022
CHARGES ARE FORCE IN ACCORDANCE

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:15.524
WITH STATE LAWS.

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:16.291
SO -- HAVE

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.326
TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE HOW ALL

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:19.628
THIS IS WORKING OR SERVICE OR AN

01:18:19.694 --> 01:18:20.896
ARTICLE FROM FROM THE TURNER

IT'S HAPPENING.

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.152
OF INSIDE OF THE FOOTPRINT OF

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.053

CAPACITY --

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.511
IS -- IS

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:44.179
IMPORTANT --

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.814
AS EIGHTY USE POTENTIALLY YOUR

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.582
BEING OFFERED AS AS PART OF A

01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:49.784
SOLUTION FOR OUR OUR CRISIS IN

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:50.619
THE BAY AREA OF AFFORDABLE

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:51.286
HOUSING.

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:52.387
BE COULD REALLY REPRESENT A

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.089
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN IN HOUSING

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.423
DEVELOPMENT AND IN ACCOUNTING

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:56.758
FOR IN PLANNING FOR THOSE

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:59.094
DEMANDS ON OUR SYSTEM --

01:19:59.161 --> 01:19:59.628
SO YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF A

01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:03.098
RECENT I'M 25% OF HOMEOWNER SAID

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:04.499
THAT THEY WOULD WOULD CONSIDER

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:06.234
SERIOUSLY ADDING AN EIGHTY YOU --

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.403
SO THAT WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:09.037
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS I THINK I

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:09.838
THINK IT WAS FROM A TURNER

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:10.972
REPORT THAT MENTION THE BAY AREA

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:13.041
PULL BUT OVER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:14.509
SO FOR OUR SINGLE FAMILY

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:16.111
RESIDENTIAL POPULATION.

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:18.146
THAT WOULD REPRESENT AROUND

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:19.147
NINETY THOUSAND EIGHTY USE OVER

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:20.315
TWENTY YEARS DIVIDED BY THE

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:21.983
THAT'S ABOUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.151
UNITS A YEAR.

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:24.252
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE ADDED

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.320
TO OUR SYSTEM --

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:26.888
WE ADDED FIVE HUNDRED SINGLE

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:28.190
FAMILY HOME EQUIVALENTS --

01:20:28.256 --> 01:20:30.692
LAST YEAR FOR SFR IS NOT FOR

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:32.894
MULTI FAMILY SO --

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:34.396
IS SO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED VIEW IS

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:35.297
ABOUT TEN TIMES WHAT WE'RE

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:37.232
ADDING NOW AND SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:38.466
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT.

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:40.435
AND POTENTIALLY REPRESENTS AS AS

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:41.803
WE SAID AN ENTIRELY NEW HOUSING

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.205
PARADIGM WITH POTENTIALLY

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:44.706
SIGNIFICANT WATER WASTEWATER

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:45.774
SERVICE DEMANDS THAT WE WOULD

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.475
NEED TO PREPARE --

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:48.977
FOR SO WHEN'S NEW STRUCTURES ARE

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:50.512
BEING BUILT THAT RESULT IN

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:51.980
INCREASED DEMAND ON THE SYSTEM --

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.481
UTILITIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:54.716
IMPOSE CONNECTION CAPACITY FEES

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:56.585
AND IF NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:57.686
FOR THOSE COSTS WILL SIMPLY

01:20:57.752 --> 01:20:59.387
SHIFT FROM --

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:00.355
YOU KNOW --

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.657
THE DEVELOPMENT TO THE REPAIRS --

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:05.994
AND THIS OF COURSE DRIVE

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:09.097
SEPARATES AND IN OUR CASE

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:11.700
PERSONALLY BURDENS THE OF A

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:13.235
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:14.135
PARTICULAR SERVICE AREA.

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:15.804
SO THAT'S ARE PERSPECTIVE WE

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.038
HOPE IT'S HELPFUL --

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:18.673

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:34.756
RURAL AREAS I AM CONCERNED

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:35.757

INTERESTED IN YEAH. EIGHTY USE.

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.127
BUT IF THERE'S HOOK UPS AND

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:40.862
STUFF SOME OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:43.298
IN OUR OLDER COMMUNITIES ARE

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:45.367

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:47.168
HATE TO SEE THEIR FEES GO UP BUT

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.870
I ALSO UNDERSTAND --

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:50.572
IT KIND OF OPENS UP A CAN OF

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.840
WORMS IN SOME COMMUNITIES

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.808
BECAUSE YOU GO TO FIX SOMETHING

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.176

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:04.185
DO WE MAKE SURE THIS KIND OF

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:06.521
LEGISLATION OR WHATEVER IT WORKS

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.464
I HAD ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR MR

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.466
GARCIA FROM THE TURNER CENTER SO --

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:21.503

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:22.103
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FROM YOUR

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.571
CENTER ABOUT THE SEATTLE

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:25.140
VANCOUVER --

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:27.175
AND PORTLET EXPERIENCES COULD

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:28.743
YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT POLICIES A

01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:30.312
MOVE FORWARD --

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:30.879
THAT ARE DIFFERENT OR BETTER

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:33.148
THAN WHAT WE CAN DO WE'VE GOT

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:33.882
LESSONS TO LEARN.

01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:34.816
SURE -- IN

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:37.285
JUST TO CLARIFY ABOVE

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:39.521
SPECIFICALLY FEES SO EL ALL

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:41.423
THEIR POLICIES WELL IT SEEMS AS

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:42.724
I JUST CAN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.259
OF THE REPORT IT SEEMS LIKE --

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:46.061
THOSE THREE CITIES THAT HAVE

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:47.896
ALSO HAVE A LOT OF THE SAME

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:48.863
HOUSING ISSUES THAT WE DO HAVE

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:51.366
BAD MARKEDLY MORE SUCCESSFUL AT

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:52.600
EIGHTY PRODUCTION THEM

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:54.402
CALIFORNIA HAS IN RECENT YEARS.

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:55.003
WONDERING WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.904
DIFFERENTLY --

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:56.438
SO -- I

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:57.706
WOULD SAY THAT --

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:59.307
THOSE THREE SPECIFIC CITIES HAVE

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:01.343
DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS --

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:03.812
THAT HAVE PRE DATE THE STATEWIDE

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:05.480
PERFORMS AT THE WE HAD JUST A

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:07.215
FEW YEARS AGO --

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:08.683
I ALREADY MENTIONED WITH

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:09.651
PORTLAND DID WITH REGARDS TO

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:11.019
FEES I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:12.754
THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT --

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:14.589
STEP FORWARD IN THE DEVELOPMENT

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.758
EIGHTY USE IN PORTLAND --

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.593
BEFORE THAT CHANGE WAS MADE --

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.995
FEES WERE OFTEN TIMES CITED JUST

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.630
AS MUCH AS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:25.166
AND FINANCING IS A MAJOR BARRIER

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:25.800
TO DEVELOPING A TO USE IN THAT

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:29.704
CITY -- IN

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.005
PLACES LIKE SEATTLE IN BEING

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:33.375
WHAT IS ACTUAL --

01:23:33.441 --> 01:23:36.044
OUT ON ALIVE SO SET BACKS IF THE

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:37.245
OURS ARE THINGS THAT I THINK

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:38.680
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED HERE AT THE

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.048
STATE LEVEL AS WELL --

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:41.249
ANOTHER INTERESTING COMPONENT TO

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:42.183
SOME OF THE CITIES HAVE

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.785
ADDRESSED IS ALSO THE ISSUE

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.620
VOTER OCCUPANCY.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:46.554
AND THAT IN.

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:47.856
PORTLAND AND NO LONGER HAS --

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:49.924
WATER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS AND

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:51.359
THEY HAVE SEEN SOME INCREASES

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:53.661
RESULT THEIR SOLUTIONS SOME OF

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:55.330
WHAT WE'VE SEEN --

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:56.998
DONE IN THESE OTHER CITIES THAT

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:57.932
POTENTIALLY COULD SERVE AS

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:59.334
MODELS FOR WHAT WE MAY WANT TO

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:00.435
DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT THE

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:03.505
WHETHER IT'S THE CITY LEVEL OR

01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:03.938
PERHAPS AT THE STATE

01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:04.239
[inaudible]

01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:08.943
THANK YOU.

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.346
I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR

01:30:26.721 --> 01:30:28.556
THE CITY OF ENCINITAS HAS

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:30.091
RECENTLY --

01:30:30.158 --> 01:30:33.161
ADOPTED PRE APPROVED EIGHTY YOU

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:35.163
PLANS AND THE CITY TO FUNDED

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:37.598
CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS --

01:30:37.665 --> 01:30:38.966
FOR I THINK TWELVE DIFFERENT

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:41.335
VARIATIONS OF EIGHTY USE RIGHT

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:43.137
RANGING FROM STUDIO ALL THE WAY

01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:44.872
UP TO THREE BEDROOM --

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:47.074
LIVING UNITS THAT THE CITY PAID

01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:48.609
FOR THE DESIGN HOMEOWNERS CAN

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:50.144
COME AND GET THOSE CONSTRUCTION

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:52.280
DRAWINGS FOR FREE THE CITY HAS

01:30:52.346 --> 01:30:53.815
PRE PERMITTED THEM.

01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:56.417
SO THE DESIGN COSTS AND

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:58.352
PERMITTING COSTS ARE GREATLY

01:30:58.419 --> 01:31:00.288
REDUCED FOR HOMEOWNERS --

01:31:00.354 --> 01:31:01.522
AND THAT'S A WAY TO REDUCE THE

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:03.257
BARRIER FOR CREATING EIGHTY

01:31:03.324 --> 01:31:05.927
YEARS WHILE HAVING DESIGNS THAT.

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:07.528
THE NEIGHBORS HAVE ALL OVER THE

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:10.898
CITY HAS ALREADY REFLECT LOCAL

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:12.633
CONDITIONS AND CONCERNS --

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:15.269
AND THAT LEADS A SPEEDIER AND

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:18.139
LESS COSTLY PRODUCTION OF OF

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:18.739
EIGHTIES ON THE PART OF THE

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:19.640
HOMEOWNERS --

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:22.076
SO THOSE ARE SOME IDEAS OF

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:23.077
THINGS THAT ARE WORKING WELL

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.679
UNDER THAT THE CURRENT LAWS THAT

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:25.313
WE HAVE.

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:28.583
AND AS WE THINK OF WAYS TO YOU --

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:30.084
CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE EIGHTY

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:31.485
DEVELOPMENT GOING FORWARD I DID

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:34.121
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW AREAS --

01:31:34.188 --> 01:31:35.056
WHERE WE SHOULD ALSO BE THINKING

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:36.123
ABOUT --

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:37.792
LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES TO

01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:38.492
ADDRESS --

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:40.728
AS WERE MENTIONED IN AN OPENING

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:43.931
REMARKS AND THAT CONTEXT MATTERS

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:44.832
FOR WHERE WE'RE PUTTING EIGHTY

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:46.133
USE -- PART

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.568
OF GOOD PLANNING A CERTAINLY

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:49.070
THINKING OF CONTEXT SENSITIVE

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:50.771
REGULATIONS I DON'T SPEAK JUST A

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:52.006
LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:53.741
WHY SOME ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:55.910
STANDARDS DON'T REALLY WORK --

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:57.879
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR EIGHTY

01:31:57.945 --> 01:31:59.480
YEARS ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:01.449
CONSIDERING THE VARIATIONS IN

01:32:01.515 --> 01:32:03.184
HOUSING DEMANDED ENVIRONMENTAL

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:05.820
FACTORS BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN

01:32:05.887 --> 01:32:07.722
INFILL AREAS THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:09.023
DISTINCTION --

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:10.691
YOUR EARLIER PANEL SPOKE QUITE A

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:11.726
BIT ABOUT FEES AND

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:13.261
INFRASTRUCTURE SO I WON'T SPEND

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:15.062
MUCH TIME ON IT BUT I DO WANT TO

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:16.197
EMPHASIZE THAT.

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:17.431
PROPER PLANNING REQUIRES

01:32:17.498 --> 01:32:19.867
RELATING GROSS TO THE CAPACITY

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:21.602
TO SUPPORT THAT GROWTH AND

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:22.737
MAKING SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:24.171
CAN ABSORB THE GROWTH THAT'S

01:32:24.238 --> 01:32:25.940
PLANNED FOR THEM.

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:31.646
AND PLANNING ALSO REQUIRES HAVE

01:32:31.712 --> 01:32:33.681
STABILITY AND CONSISTENCY SO

01:32:33.748 --> 01:32:35.249
THAT WE CAN RESPOND TO AN

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:36.951
IMPLEMENT CHANGES THAT HAVE

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:37.518
HAPPENED ALREADY --

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:39.787
SO.

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.522
FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:43.891
CONTEXT SENSITIVITY AND AND

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:46.627
THOSE RELATED ISSUES --

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:47.995
I AS AN ORGANIZATION AT

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:50.364
CALIFORNIA EPA WITH SUPPORTS.

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:52.199
ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL EIGHTY

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:53.834
YOU IN AN ALMOST ANY EXISTING

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:55.236
STRUCTURE FOR THE REASONS THAT

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.771
WE HEARD FROM THE PANELISTS

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.439
EARLIER TODAY --

01:32:58.506 --> 01:33:00.207
AS LONG AS THOSE ARE ARE PAIRED

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:00.908
WITH.

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:03.144
LOT COVERAGE STANDARDS THAT

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:03.778
WOULD PERMIT.

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:06.447
PERMIT NEW DETACHED EIGHTY YEARS

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:08.015
AND THOSE ARE BOTH.

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.750
A REASONABLE WAYS TO ALLOW NEW

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:10.551
EIGHTY YEARS WHILE STILL I AM

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:11.953
HAVING SOME.

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:16.324
CHECK ON ON THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH --

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.592
BUT THE CONTEXT I THINK DESERVES

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:20.528
TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY --

01:33:20.594 --> 01:33:21.796
AS I MENTIONED BETWEEN URBAN

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:25.333
INFILL AREAS AND RURAL AREAS I'M.

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:27.268
THINKING SPECIFICALLY OF RURAL

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:29.403
AREAS -- I'M

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:30.805
WARY OF ENCOURAGING TOO MUCH

01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:32.707
GROWTH IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S

01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:34.075
NOT TRANSIT ACCESS --

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:36.711
OR EVEN NEARBY SERVICES I THINK

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:38.346
THAT THAT --

01:33:38.412 --> 01:33:40.848
HAVING MULTIPLE EIGHTY USE ON

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:42.383
MORE RURAL LOTS --

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:43.818
RUNS THE RISK OF INCREASING

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:45.286
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:47.088
POTENTIALLY EVEN RUNNING COUNTER

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:48.389
TO SEE SOME OF THE I. GHG

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:49.824
REDUCTION GOALS AND CLIMATE

01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:51.459
POLICIES THAT WE HAVE --

01:33:51.525 --> 01:33:53.661
DIFFERENT CONTEXT AGAIN FOR

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:55.262
URBAN INFILL SITE --

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:57.164
SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO

01:33:57.231 --> 01:33:58.833
INTENSIFY EIGHTY YEARS HAVING

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.935
THOSE BE OPTING PROGRAMS ARE

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:02.570
HAVING DIFFERENT ROLES BETWEEN --

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:04.905
RURAL AND URBAN AREAS MAKES A

01:34:04.972 --> 01:34:06.073
LOT OF SENSE --

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.042
I'M ALSO SENSITIVE TO RURAL

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:09.543
AREAS WHERE AGRICULTURE REMAINS

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.045
PREVALENT AND THE MORE

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:12.413
RESIDENTIAL USES THAT ARE

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.016
BROUGHT INTO AGRICULTURAL AREAS --

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.617
THE MORE AT RISK THOSE ACT

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:18.052
AGRICULTURAL PRESERVATION

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:19.453
EFFORTS BECOMES AND I'M I WANT

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.888
TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT.

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:23.290
AND ASK THAT THAT BE PART OF THE

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:26.527
CONCERT EIGHTY YEARS ARE

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:30.398
ENCOURAGED AND PERMITTED --

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:32.700
AND THEN I ALSO AM.

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:34.802
IN LATE SPECTACULARLY ITS TOP OF

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:36.904
MIND I'M FOLLOWING THE PAST TWO

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.806
YEARS OF FIRES.

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:41.175
WHERE WE PERMIT GROWTH HAS A

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:42.543
DRASTIC CONSEQUENCES FOR THE

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:45.713
SCALE AND SCOPE OF THOSE TYPES

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:46.647
OF DISASTERS --

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:48.516
AND MAKING SURE THAT AT LEAST

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:49.950
THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:34:50.017 --> 01:34:51.352
SENSIBLE LOCAL CONTROLS THAT

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:53.054
WILL REDUCE FIRE HAZARDS AS

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:53.854
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.856
INTENSIFIES IS AN IMPORTANT

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:57.091
POINT --

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:58.893
MINIMUM STANDARDS --

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:01.962
IN URBAN AREAS AROUND FAR IN LOT

01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:03.130
COVERAGE.

01:35:03.197 --> 01:35:04.832
ALLOWING SOME LOCAL FLEXIBILITY

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:06.233
FOR THOSE TYPES OF STANDARDS IS

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.835
IMPORTANT IT HELPS INSURE GREEN

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:09.837
SPACE AN OTHERWISE BUILT OUT

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:10.871
ENVIRONMENTS.

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:11.906
AND IT CAN HELP REDUCE

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:14.341
NEIGHBORHOOD OPPOSITION TO NEW.

01:35:14.408 --> 01:35:15.543
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND

01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:17.244
INTENSIFICATION AND WITHIN THOSE

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:18.879
AREAS -- AND

01:35:18.946 --> 01:35:20.714
IN MORE RURAL AREAS --

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.450
Là COVERAGE F. A. R. ESPECIALLY

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.485
SETBACKS BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.320
TO PROVIDING DEFENSIBLE SPACES

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:28.322
TO MINIMIZE FIRE RISK --

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.724
SO MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:33.260
LOCAL ABILITY TO HAVE --

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:35.296
APPROPRIATE IN CONTEXT SENSITIVE

01:35:35.362 --> 01:35:36.630
RULES AROUND THAT IS IS AGAIN

01:35:36.697 --> 01:35:40.568
JUST VERY IMPORTANT --

01:35:40.634 --> 01:35:41.902
I DID WANT TO PICK UP ON A

01:35:41.969 --> 01:35:42.837
COMMENT THAT --

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.505
DAVID GOING FROM SANTA ROSA HAD

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:47.007
SHARED EARLIER THAT IN SMALL

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:47.775
EIGHTY USE --

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:49.643
LIKELY DON'T HAVE THEM ANYMORE

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:52.079
IMPACT ON THE RESIDENTIAL --

01:35:52.146 --> 01:35:52.680
HOME --

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:56.650
WOULD INDEPENDENTLY AND AND THAT --

01:35:56.717 --> 01:35:58.185
BUT AS EIGHTY USE THAT ARE

01:35:58.252 --> 01:35:59.753
PERMITTED ALL THE WAY UP TO

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:00.754
TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET --

01:36:00.821 --> 01:36:03.557
COME INTO PLAY WHEN I LIVE IN A

01:36:03.624 --> 01:36:04.592
THREE BEDROOM TWELVE HUNDRED

01:36:04.658 --> 01:36:05.860
SQUARE FOOT AND HOUSE AND

01:36:05.926 --> 01:36:06.927
BERKELEY.

01:36:06.994 --> 01:36:08.896
AND THAT THAT'S NO DIFFERENT --

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:10.731
IN TERMS OF IMPACT THAN --

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:13.968
A LARGE EIGHTY YEARS SO I'M

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:15.102
THINKING ABOUT THE SIZE AND AS

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:17.138
WORLD ALLOWING LARGER EIGHTY USE

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:18.806
MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITIES AND

01:36:18.873 --> 01:36:20.674
HAVE THE ABILITY TO ABSORB THAT

01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:22.376
GROWTH AS WE INCREASED

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:24.345
POPULATION DENSITY THREE LARGER

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:25.146
EIGHTY YEARS.

01:36:25.212 --> 01:36:27.348
AND THERE WILL BE AN INCREASED

01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:28.616
DEMAND ON SERVICE SAYS --

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.451
SEWER AND WATER CAPACITY ROSE

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:32.153
TRANSIT SCHOOLS I AM IT IT IS

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:34.021
IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND --

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:36.490
ESPECIALLY IF MORE THAN ONE

01:36:36.557 --> 01:36:37.391
EIGHTY YOU WAS GOING TO BE

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:38.659
PERMITTED HER A LOT --

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:40.461
I THINK IT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:41.128
TO YOU.

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:42.763
ALLOW JURISDICTIONS TO PERMIT

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.131
THAT I AM ESPECIALLY IF THEY CAN

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:46.267
DO YOU THE ANALYSIS TO MAKE SURE

01:36:46.333 --> 01:36:46.800
THAT THEIR COMMUNITIES CAN

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:47.968
ABSORB.

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:49.303
THAT INTENSIVE INTENSIFIED

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:51.172
GROWTH BUT MAKING THAT SORT OF

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:54.608
REAL MANDATORY --

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:55.109
I THINK RUNS THE RISK OF

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:59.079
STRAINING AND THE EAST BAY

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:00.414
MUNICIPAL.

01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:02.116
UTILITY DISTRICT ABOUT AND THAT

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:04.552
AGENCIES POTENTIAL CHALLENGES --

SHE A COUPLE HUNDRED

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:42.716
APPLICATIONS COMING IN EVERY

01:43:42.783 --> 01:43:45.218
MONTH NOW WE'RE AT APPROXIMATELY

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:46.420
FOUR HUNDRED APPLICATIONS COMING

01:43:46.486 --> 01:43:47.321
IN A MONTH FOR ACCESSORY

01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:49.890
DWELLING UNITS --

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:51.758
IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION WE WENT

01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:54.194
THROUGH AND MAPPING EXERCISE TO

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:56.229
TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THESE IDEAS

01:43:56.296 --> 01:43:56.997
WERE COMING UP THROUGHOUT THE

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:58.832
CITY -- AND

01:43:58.899 --> 01:44:00.601
GENERALLY THE THE ACCESSORY

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:02.336
DWELLING UNITS SEEM TO BE WELL

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:04.137
DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE CITY --

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:05.906
THEIR GREATEST CONCENTRATIONS

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:08.108
ARE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:09.943
IN AREAS SUCH AS SUN VALLEY

01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:11.812
NORTH HOLLYWOOD VAN NUYS THOSE

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:13.981
ARE PARTS OF OUR CITY WHERE WE

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:15.616
TEND TO HAVE LARGER LOT SIZES --

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:17.718
BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY EIGHTY

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:18.518
USE --

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:21.922
ACROSS THE CITY AND AND WEST LA

01:44:21.989 --> 01:44:23.824
AND IN SOUTH LA THESE ARE

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:26.159
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT REPRESENTS --

01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:27.628
YOU KNOW DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHICS

01:44:27.694 --> 01:44:28.862
BEING A REP YOU KNOW RANGING

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:29.963
FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF

01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:32.599
COLOR TO WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:33.467
SO WE'RE SEEING IT --

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:35.535
A EXCESS REELING IS REALLY

01:44:35.602 --> 01:44:36.670
DISPERSED ACROSS THE CITY --

01:44:36.737 --> 01:44:37.771
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:40.407
ABOUT 45% OF ALL THE EIGHTY YOU

01:44:40.474 --> 01:44:42.509
PERMITS THAT OF THAT NINE

01:44:42.576 --> 01:44:43.043
THOUSAND THAT I MENTIONED

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:44.444
EARLIER --

01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:46.313
OUR CONVERSIONS OF EXISTING

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.914
SPACE -- YOU

01:44:47.981 --> 01:44:49.282
KNOW DUE TO THE SPECIFIC

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:51.018
REGULATIONS UNDER STATE LAW WITH

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:52.352
RESPECT TO CONVERSIONS --

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:55.489
WHEN THAT WHEN WE WHEN THE STATE

01:44:55.555 --> 01:44:58.425
LAW FIRST CAME VERSION SO I

01:44:58.492 --> 01:44:59.793
THINK THIS IS BEEN AN IMPORTANT

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.128
COMPONENT OF --

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:02.562
THE REGULATIONS OF THAT STATE

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:04.364
LAW THAT'S REALLY ALLOWED FOR

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:05.265
THE CREATION OF A TO USE IN THE

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:06.967
CITY OF LOS ANGELES --

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:08.301
THE REMAINDER OF THE EIGHTY USE

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:10.404
CONSIST OF ABOUT 35% ADDITIONS

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:13.540
AND 20% NEW CONSTRUCTION --

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:14.908
OTHER ASPECTS OF THE STATE LAW

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:16.677
THAT HAVE LIKELY RESULTED IN THE

01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:18.211
EIGHTY YOU PRODUCTION INCREASES

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:19.246
THE REMOVAL OF THE PASSAGEWAY

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:20.580
REQUIREMENT THAT WAS A REAL

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:21.481
BARRIER FOR US.

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:23.917
IN LOS ANGELES ALSO THE REMOVAL

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:25.185
REMOVAL I HAVE --

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:26.453
MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND THAT'S

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:27.621
WHERE THE INCREASE OF SQUARE

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:30.257
FOOTAGE LIMITATIONS --

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:30.924
TO TWELVE HUNDRED AS WELL AS THE

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:32.893
PARKING THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:33.393
IS.

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.728
YOU KNOW A FEW AREAS OF THE CITY

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:36.663
OF LOS ANGELES REQUIRE PARKING

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:40.300
DUE TO ADJACENCY TO TRANSIT.

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:42.002
I GET ALL THIS PRODUCTION HAS

01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:43.970
OCCURRED UNDER STATE LAW --

01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:45.005
I MENTIONED THERE IS A LOCAL

01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:47.240
ORDINANCE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:49.109
THE LA CITY COUNCIL THIS

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:51.545
ORDINANCE IS LOOKING AT LIMITING

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:53.880
EIGHTY USE IN CERTAIN HIVE FIRE

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:54.948
HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES WITH

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:58.418
LIMITED ST APT ACCESS --

01:45:58.485 --> 01:45:59.619
WE'VE DONE SOME ANALYSIS WE

01:45:59.686 --> 01:46:01.054
DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THIS

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:02.689
RESTRICTION SHOULD THE LOCAL

01:46:02.756 --> 01:46:04.624
ORDINANCE BE ADOPTED --

01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:05.592
THAT WILL DRAMATICALLY CHANGE

01:46:05.659 --> 01:46:08.028
THE NUMBERS ONLY ABOUT 2% EIGHTY

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:10.097
USE OF OF THAT NINE THOUSAND I

01:46:10.163 --> 01:46:11.398
MENTIONED --

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:13.433
HAVE BEEN IN THIS TYPE BUYER

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:16.603
HAZARD SEVERITIES ON MOST OF THE

01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:19.406
AGAIN MOST I HAVE BEEN

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:21.408
CONVERSIONS WHICH WOULD CONTINUE

01:46:21.475 --> 01:46:22.709
TO BE ALLOWED --

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:25.045
OUR LOCAL ORDINANCES ALSO

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:25.879
EXPLORING --

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:28.014
PERMITTING MOVABLE TINY HOMES AS

01:46:28.081 --> 01:46:30.183
A TYPE OF ACCESSORY DWELLING

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:32.619
UNIT WHICH TODAY IS CURRENTLY

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:35.455
NOT PERMITTED IN OUR ZONING CODE --

01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:36.523
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.792
HEARD MANY EIGHTY YOU APPLICANTS

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:40.594
ENCOUNTERING IN LOS ANGELES IS

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:43.930
COMPLEX WITH LADWP EASEMENTS.

01:46:43.997 --> 01:46:45.398
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE LARGELY

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:47.534
CENTERED AROUND POWER LINES THAT

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:49.569
EXTENDS OVER MANY BACKYARDS

01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:50.170
ALLEYWAYS IN THE CITY OF LOS

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:51.304
ANGELES.

01:46:51.371 --> 01:46:53.974
OUR LOCAL UTILITY LA W. P. --

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:56.209
ESTABLISHED LOCAL REGULATIONS IN

01:46:56.276 --> 01:46:57.711
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES --

01:46:57.778 --> 01:46:58.645
THAT PREVENT ANY HOW IT'LL

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:00.413
STRUCTURES WITHIN A UTILITY

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.982
EASEMENT AND NO CONSTRUCTION

01:47:02.048 --> 01:47:03.650
WHATSOEVER UNDERNEATH THE DRIP

01:47:03.717 --> 01:47:05.752
LINE SO THESE LOCAL ROLES

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:07.687
ACTUALLY GO BEYOND.

01:47:07.754 --> 01:47:08.755
THIS WHAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:10.991
AT THE STATE WIDE UTILITY LEVEL

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:12.492
THREE GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:14.161
A WHICH ALLOWS SOME LEVEL OF

01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:15.762
CONSTRUCTION UNDER THE DRIP LINE

01:47:15.829 --> 01:47:16.997
WITH -- WITH

01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:19.599
WITH A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND ALSO

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:21.001
I HAVE ALLOWS CONSTRUCTION

01:47:21.067 --> 01:47:22.969
WITHIN A SIX BUT EASEMENT AROUND

01:47:23.036 --> 01:47:25.672
THE POWER LINE --

01:47:25.739 --> 01:47:26.907
WITH WE'VE LEARNED THAT LED DB

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.241
W. P. HAS BEEN --

01:47:28.308 --> 01:47:29.342
HAS THESE MORE RESTRICTIVE

01:47:29.409 --> 01:47:30.811
REGULATIONS BECAUSE OF THE

01:47:30.877 --> 01:47:32.445
TECHNOLOGY THAT DELUDE P.

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:33.647
EMPLOYS WHERE AND IF A POWER

01:47:33.713 --> 01:47:35.982
LINE DROPS IT REMAINS ACTIVE AND

01:47:36.049 --> 01:47:37.784
REMAINS LIVE --

01:47:37.851 --> 01:47:39.352
OTHER UTILITIES SUCH AS AT AS AN

01:47:39.419 --> 01:47:40.821
EMPLOYEE TECHNOLOGY WHERE WHEN

01:47:40.887 --> 01:47:42.122
THE POWER LINE DROPS IT IN AND

01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:43.456
IT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE BECOMES

01:47:43.523 --> 01:47:48.395
AN ACTIVE --

01:47:48.461 --> 01:47:52.032
SO THESE THESE EASEMENT 20% OF

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:54.167
OUR EIGHTY YOU APPLICATIONS THAT

01:47:54.234 --> 01:47:55.502
ARE COMING IN --

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:56.837
WE'RE CONTINUING TO ADVANCE

01:47:56.903 --> 01:47:59.472
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE D. W. P. --

01:47:59.539 --> 01:48:01.107
TO FIND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO

01:48:01.174 --> 01:48:02.309
THIS ISSUE --

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.277
AND SAFETY CONTINUES TO BE A

01:48:04.344 --> 01:48:05.612
PARAMOUNT --

01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:07.080
DISCUSSION ITEM --

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:08.949
AT THESE MEETINGS.

01:48:09.015 --> 01:48:10.717
I DID ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:11.818
TO MENTION SOME OF THE EFFORTS

01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:13.420
THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING WITH

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:14.855
EIGHTY USE IN THE CITY OF LOS

01:48:14.921 --> 01:48:15.555
ANGELES THROUGH THE MAYOR'S

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:16.456
OFFICE --

01:48:16.523 --> 01:48:18.158
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IS INNOVATION

01:48:18.225 --> 01:48:20.093
TEAM IN PARTICULAR --

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.428
SO FIRST OF THE MAYOR'S OFFICE

01:48:21.494 --> 01:48:22.863
HAS BEEN WORKING ON AN EIGHTY

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.297
YOU PILOT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

01:48:24.364 --> 01:48:26.299
YEARS THROUGH THIS PILOT PROGRAM

01:48:26.366 --> 01:48:28.235
THE CITY HAS PROVIDED A GRANTS

01:48:28.301 --> 01:48:30.036
TO A HOUSEHOLD IN HIGHLAND PARK

01:48:30.103 --> 01:48:32.005
NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES ON

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:33.039
WHERE THE HOMEOWNER WANTED TO

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:34.574
CONSTRUCT AN EIGHTY YOU.

01:48:34.641 --> 01:48:36.176
THE CITY REALLY USE THIS PILOT

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:37.544
AS A WAY TO LEARN WHAT WAS

01:48:37.611 --> 01:48:40.080
WORKING AND WHAT WAS NOT WORKING

01:48:40.146 --> 01:48:40.680
THREE OF EIGHTY YOU PERMITTING

01:48:40.747 --> 01:48:41.481
PROCESS.

01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:43.250
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:43.884
TO CONSTRUCTING EIGHTY USE IT

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:46.186
JUST HAS BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE.

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:48.088
PARTICULARLY AS WE THINK ABOUT

01:48:48.154 --> 01:48:49.756
EIGHTY USES A POTENTIAL SOLUTION

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:51.024
FOR HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME

01:48:51.091 --> 01:48:51.958
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF

01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:52.826
COLOR.

01:48:52.893 --> 01:48:54.594
IS ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND SO

01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:56.296
THROUGH THIS PILOT PROGRAM THE

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:57.030
CITY HAS WORKED WITH THE

01:48:57.097 --> 01:48:58.498
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION LOCALLY

01:48:58.565 --> 01:49:00.467
GENESIS LA TO CREATE A LOAN

01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:02.235
PRODUCT THAT WOULD ALLOW A

01:49:02.302 --> 01:49:04.471
HOMEOWNER TO BORROW AGAINST THE

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:06.473
FUTURE VALUE OF THEIR HOME. TO

01:49:06.539 --> 01:49:08.775
CONSTRUCT AN EIGHTY YOU AND A

01:49:08.842 --> 01:49:11.111
CITY THROUGH SITUATIONS

01:49:11.177 --> 01:49:13.146
INCLUDING WALLS FARGO TO EXPAND

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:14.147
SUCH SIMILAR --

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:16.816
PRODUCTS.

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:17.784
ANOTHER EFFORT THAT THE MAYOR'S

01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:19.019
OFFICE HAS ENGAGED IN IS THE

01:49:19.085 --> 01:49:20.420
CREATION OF AN EIGHTY YOU

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:22.255
GUIDELINES DOCUMENTED A SORT OF

01:49:22.322 --> 01:49:23.390
A BROCHURE.

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:24.557
THE CITY'S PARTNERED WITH UCLA

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:26.893
CITY LAB TO CREATE A USER

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:28.795
FRIENDLY GUIDE TO HELP ASSIST

01:49:28.862 --> 01:49:29.930
THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER WHO MAY

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.731
NOT KNOW HOW O NAVIGATE THROUGH

01:49:31.798 --> 01:49:33.400
THE BUILDING PERMITTING SYSTEM --

01:49:33.466 --> 01:49:35.568
AND PROVIDES BASIC INFORMATION

01:49:35.635 --> 01:49:37.470
ON AND AND WALKS HOMEOWNERS TO

01:49:37.537 --> 01:49:38.605
THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH THE

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:40.473
CITY WORKING WITH A LENDER AND

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:41.274
WORKING WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO

01:49:41.341 --> 01:49:42.509
ACTUALLY GET.

01:49:42.575 --> 01:49:44.010
THE EIGHTY YOU BILLS.

01:49:44.077 --> 01:49:45.278
AND THEN FINALLY THE MAYOR'S

01:49:45.345 --> 01:49:47.514
OFFICE WAS RECENTLY AWARDED A

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:49.282
BLOOMBERG INNOVATION CHALLENGE

01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:52.185
THE GRANT INCENTIVIZE IS

01:49:52.252 --> 01:49:54.120
HOMEOWNERS TO BUILD EIGHTY USE

01:49:54.187 --> 01:49:56.389
FOR PUBLIC GOODS SO REALLY --

NUMBER THAT TO YOU JUST

01:51:50.537 --> 01:51:52.505

01:51:52.572 --> 01:51:55.308
WE DID HAVE LEGISLATION LIKE ON

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:59.546
THE ISSUE OF POWER LINES OF A

01:51:59.612 --> 01:52:00.113
TRYING TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:01.714
THAT'S A A BEEN A SOURCE OF

01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:03.249
GREAT FRUSTRATION THAT WE

01:52:03.316 --> 01:52:04.451

HAVE CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH

01:52:19.732 --> 01:52:21.935
LADWP ON BUT I I I THINK WE'RE

01:52:22.001 --> 01:52:24.437
CLOSER AT IDENTIFYING WHAT

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:25.805
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS CAN BE I

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:26.940
THINK WE'RE REALLY.

01:52:27.006 --> 01:52:28.174
HONING IN ON THE LOCAL

01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:29.776

01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:32.145
REGULATION IN A WAY THAT STILL

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:34.647
CONSISTENT WITH GENERAL ORDER.

NINETY FIVE MIGHT BE A

01:52:35.215 --> 01:52:36.216
POSSIBILITY BUT IT STILL

01:52:36.282 --> 01:52:39.586
REQUIRES FURTHER DISCUSSIONS SO --

01:52:39.652 --> 01:52:41.754
MAYBE GO GOOD IDEA --

01:52:41.821 --> 01:52:42.522

MAYBE THERE'S A WAY OF HELPING

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:48.128
TO FACILITATE THAT CONVERSATION

01:52:48.194 --> 01:52:49.729
SO THAT HAPPENS MORE QUICKLY

01:52:49.796 --> 01:52:51.531
OBVIOUSLY.

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:55.101
THIS IS A ONE OF THE MANY TOOLS

01:52:55.168 --> 01:52:58.238

WE'VE ALSO BEEN --

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:04.137
AS PART OF THIS --

01:54:04.204 --> 01:54:09.242
IT INNOVATION GRANT LOOKING WAYS --

01:54:09.309 --> 01:54:11.311

WHERE ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS NOT

01:54:28.127 --> 01:54:28.995
AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE TO CONNECT

INSTITUTIONS I THINK THERE'S

01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:46.679
JUST A BROAD INTEREST AND FIGURE

01:54:46.746 --> 01:54:47.714
OUT HOW TO DO THIS IN THE FACT

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:48.248
THAT.

01:54:48.314 --> 01:54:49.649
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN AS FAR AS WE

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:51.150

01:54:51.217 --> 01:54:52.051
TO BE DONE.

01:54:52.118 --> 01:54:54.187
A BROADER QUESTION TO THE

01:54:54.254 --> 01:54:56.289
PANELISTS IF YOU COULD --

01:54:56.356 --> 01:54:57.590
WAVE THE MAGIC WAND AND THERE

01:54:57.657 --> 01:54:59.359
ARE STATE LAWS THAT WERE PASSED

01:54:59.425 --> 01:55:01.361
TOMORROW TO MOVE FORWARD AND

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:02.762
CONTINUE TO TURBO CHARGED.

01:55:02.829 --> 01:55:06.432
PRODUCTION OF OF ALL THE COULD

01:55:06.499 --> 01:55:09.902
SEE THIS IS WHAT WOULD YOU DO

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:11.638
AND I'M CURIOUS OR THE NEW LAWS

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:13.139
THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT.

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:15.541
O OTHER ISSUES OF OF CHALLENGES

01:55:15.608 --> 01:55:17.477
OF OF CITIES ARE OUT OF

01:55:17.543 --> 01:55:19.112
COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW WONDER

01:55:19.178 --> 01:55:20.880
HOW YOU WOULD CHARACTERIZE WHAT

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:25.485
WE OUGHT TO BE DOING.

01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:27.220
WELL YES WELL WHAT WE ALL AND WE

01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:28.521
WON'T HOLD YOU DENNIS ARE ASKING

01:55:28.588 --> 01:55:29.856
YOU JUST BE CREATIVE IN HELPING

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:30.490
US THINK THIS THROUGH WELL AS I

01:55:30.556 --> 01:55:32.859
CAN ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:55:32.925 --> 01:55:33.359
THAT --

01:55:33.426 --> 01:55:34.460
MISTER NICHOLS HIGHLIGHTED IN

01:55:34.527 --> 01:55:36.462
HIS PRESENTATION IS THAT THERE'S

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:37.864
ACTUALLY THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:40.767
ASPECTS OF CURRENT LAW THAT.

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:42.969
MAY NOT EVERY JURISDICTION IS

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:45.905
FULLY COMPLYING WITH SO.

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:48.141
AND TO ME THAT STEPS OUT AS MORE

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:50.276
OF AN ENFORCEMENT AND OVERSIGHT

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:52.445
ISSUE THEN I NEED FOR NEW

01:55:52.512 --> 01:55:53.980
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND WE

01:55:54.047 --> 01:55:54.947
HAVE.

01:55:55.014 --> 01:55:56.983
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS THAT ARE

01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:59.218
WORKING AND IN JURISDICTIONS

01:55:59.285 --> 01:56:00.320
THAT ARE USING THEM

01:56:00.386 --> 01:56:02.922
APPROPRIATELY WE'VE SEEN BIG

01:56:02.989 --> 01:56:04.891
INCREASE AS AN EIGHTY YEARS --

01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:06.893
I MEAN THE BIG ONE OF THE BIG

01:56:06.959 --> 01:56:07.593
TAKE AWAY IS --

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:10.129
AGAIN TO KEEP PICKING ON ON

01:56:10.196 --> 01:56:12.098
DAVID FROM SANTA ROSA BUT HE

01:56:12.165 --> 01:56:14.334
SOUGHT SUCH A BIG INCREASE IN

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:17.303
EIGHTY PRODUCTION WHEN THE FEET --

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:20.573
LEVELS WERE ABLE TO BE REDUCED

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:23.376
SO TO THE X. ANGEL SUPPORT AND

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:25.645
INCENTIVES TO REDUCE THEIR FEES

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:27.080
SO THAT LEGITIMATE

01:56:27.146 --> 01:56:28.348
INFRASTRUCTURE CONCERNS CAN

ACROSS THE CITY ARE STRUCTURED

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.942

01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:44.984
A COMMENT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:46.819
IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME CONTEXT --

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:49.388
AROUND THIS ISSUE AND HOW

01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:52.692
IMPORTANT --

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:54.260
ACCELERATING THAT --

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:55.328
THE CONSTRUCTION OF AS MANY

01:58:55.394 --> 01:58:58.865
IDEAS AS POSSIBLE IS --

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:01.267
EIGHTIES ARE NOT --

01:59:01.334 --> 01:59:03.636
TRADITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:06.572
SO THE COMPARISON IS NOT --

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:11.143
DIRECT IS COSTING GOTCHA OF TEN

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:12.778
TIMES LESS SOMETIMES MORE ISN'T

01:59:12.845 --> 01:59:15.681
SAN FRANCISCO IN MY AREA --

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.116
MORE THE MORE OR LESS AN AVERAGE

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:19.385
OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:59:19.452 --> 01:59:22.088
PER UNIT TO BUILD A UNIT OF

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:24.524
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TODAY. EIGHTY

01:59:24.590 --> 01:59:26.125
USE -- FILL

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:27.393
SOME OF THE NEED FOR

01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:29.228
AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE OF THE WAY

01:59:29.295 --> 01:59:30.763
THERE UTILIZED FOR CHILDREN FOR

01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:32.999
PARENTS --

01:59:33.065 --> 01:59:34.367
OFFER A VERY STEEP ON THE

01:59:34.433 --> 01:59:36.035
COMMUNITY WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A

01:59:36.102 --> 01:59:38.471
MORE AFFORDABLE --

01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:40.907
ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:43.676
HOUSING IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING

01:59:43.743 --> 01:59:46.712
OR WHATNOT --%

01:59:46.779 --> 01:59:48.981
AND SO WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY --

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:51.484
AROUND THE STATE INTO BUILDING

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:52.351
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:59:52.418 --> 01:59:55.354
IT ONLY CAN ONLY GO SO FAR I WAY

01:59:55.421 --> 01:59:58.457
OF COMPARISON THE EIGHT THOUGHT

01:59:58.524 --> 02:00:00.326
NINE ALMOST NINE THOUSAND

02:00:00.393 --> 02:00:01.794
APPLICATIONS IN LOS ANGELES --

02:00:01.861 --> 02:00:03.763
WHICH WE COULD EXTRAPOLATE FOR

02:00:03.829 --> 02:00:06.399
US STATEWIDE MAYBE HCV AS THE

02:00:06.465 --> 02:00:07.934
NUMBERS BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.736
OF A BILLION DOLLARS OF

02:00:10.803 --> 02:00:14.240
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONEY --

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:16.142
WILL PAY FOR TWO THOUSAND UNITS.

02:00:16.208 --> 02:00:18.144
AND HERE WE HAVE A LOT CHANGE

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:20.413
THAT'S CREATING CLOSE TO NINE

02:00:20.479 --> 02:00:21.981
THOUSAND UNITS JUSTIN LOS

AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:39.298
REALLY NEED IN THE STATE.

AS WE MOVE FORWARD --

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:22.435
WE BELIEVE THAT LOCAL

02:02:22.501 --> 02:02:23.436
GOVERNMENTS NEED GOVERNMENTS

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:25.271
NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:02:25.337 --> 02:02:27.339
DISCRETION OVER LIMITING EIGHTY

02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:29.975
YOU CONSTRUCTION IN AREAS THAT

SETBACK REQUIREMENTS BEING UNDER

02:02:39.418 --> 02:02:41.087
THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL

02:02:41.153 --> 02:02:42.588
GOVERNMENTS FOR THE SAME REASON.

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:44.623
HAVING SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN

02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:45.925
SOME OF THOSE UNINCORPORATED

02:02:45.991 --> 02:02:47.860
RURAL AREAS --

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:50.029
PARCEL SIZE WE LIKE TO SEE THAT

02:02:50.096 --> 02:02:51.063
CONTINUE TO BE --

02:02:51.130 --> 02:02:52.531
PART OF THE CONVERSATION.

02:02:52.598 --> 02:02:54.300
IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND

02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:57.169
RURAL AREAS PERSONAL SIZES AWAY --

02:02:57.236 --> 02:02:58.704
TO ENSURE THAT --

02:02:58.771 --> 02:03:00.306
THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY

02:03:00.372 --> 02:03:02.274
ESPECIALLY WITH SEWER SEPTIC

02:03:02.341 --> 02:03:04.777
SYSTEMS AND A LOT OF RURAL AREAS

02:03:04.844 --> 02:03:06.212
WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC WATER IT'S

02:03:06.278 --> 02:03:08.981
USUALLY A A SEPTIC SYSTEM.

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:12.051
AS YOU KNOW WHY AS PART OF THE

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:13.319
BUDGET --

02:03:13.385 --> 02:03:17.056
FUNDS FOR REPAIR FOR SEWERS --

02:03:17.123 --> 02:03:19.024
AND SO THAT'S A REAL ISSUE AND

02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:43.775
IMPLEMENT DISCRETION REVIEW

02:09:43.842 --> 02:09:46.411

02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:52.251
LAW.

02:09:52.317 --> 02:09:55.420

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:49.635
THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. EIGHTY USE

02:11:49.701 --> 02:11:52.337
CAN BE A A BELOW MARKET RATE

02:11:52.404 --> 02:11:54.106
ALTERNATIVE TO COMMENSURATE --

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:56.008
MARKET RATE OF WHAT WELL BOTH

02:11:56.074 --> 02:11:57.476
WOULD BE MARGAERY BUT AT IS ARE

02:11:57.542 --> 02:11:59.811

PART IN BUILDING SO THEY CAN BE

02:12:02.614 --> 02:12:04.383
AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY BOTH FOR

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:04.883
FOR NATURALLY OCCURRING

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:06.084
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:12:06.151 --> 02:12:10.656
AS WELL AS AN OPTION FOR FOR

02:12:10.722 --> 02:12:12.391
PURSUE MULTI GENERATIONAL

02:12:12.457 --> 02:12:13.892
HOUSEHOLDS --

02:12:13.959 --> 02:12:16.128
DEFINITELY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE

02:12:16.194 --> 02:12:18.430
FEE ISSUE THIS YEAR AND IN THAT

02:12:18.497 --> 02:12:20.332
THE ISSUES AROUND ALLOWING OWNER

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:22.334
OCCUPANCY THOSE ARE BIG

02:12:22.401 --> 02:12:23.568
CHALLENGES FOR BUILDING EIGHTY

02:12:23.635 --> 02:12:25.137
USING LOTS OF COMMUNITIES.

02:12:25.203 --> 02:12:27.005
NOT NOT IN NOT IN CERTAIN PLACES

02:12:27.072 --> 02:12:28.707
BUT IN IN IN SOME CITIES WE SEE

02:12:28.774 --> 02:12:29.975
EXCESSIVE FEES.

02:12:30.042 --> 02:12:31.476
PARK IMPACT FEES FOR EXAMPLE OF

02:12:31.543 --> 02:12:33.211
OF FORTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND

02:12:33.278 --> 02:12:34.579
DOLLARS PER UNIT --

02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:35.714
WHICH ARE REALLY JUST INTENDED

02:12:35.781 --> 02:12:37.215
NOT NOT TO MITIGATE FOR IMPACT

02:12:37.282 --> 02:12:38.750
BUT TO REALLY CURB DEVELOPMENT

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:39.985
THERE.

02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:41.820
ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE HEARD FROM

02:12:41.887 --> 02:12:43.989
MANY HOMEOWNERS THAT THE OWNER

02:12:44.056 --> 02:12:45.824
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED

02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:47.926
BY CITIES A CAN OFTEN LIMIT

02:12:47.993 --> 02:12:49.494
THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:50.796
BECAUSE BANKS GET REALLY

02:12:50.862 --> 02:12:51.496
SKITTISH.

02:12:51.563 --> 02:12:53.365
WHEN THEIR DEED RESTRICTIONS ON

02:12:53.432 --> 02:12:56.068
WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE ASSET

02:12:56.134 --> 02:12:57.736
AFTER IT'S BEEN BUILT?

02:12:57.803 --> 02:12:58.303
THAT'S THAT'S BEEN A BIG BIG

02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:58.804
CHALLENGE.

02:12:58.870 --> 02:13:01.039
WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THE THE THE

02:13:01.106 --> 02:13:02.708
THE CONCERNS FROM A CITIES LIKE

02:13:02.774 --> 02:13:04.343
SANTA ROSA WHICH REQUIRE CERTAIN

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:06.878
AMOUNTS OF AFFORDABILITY --

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.180
FOR WAITING THAT OWNER OCCUPANCY

02:13:08.246 --> 02:13:09.548
REQUIREMENT BUT I THINK THERE'S

02:13:09.614 --> 02:13:10.716
A MIDDLE GROUND THERE TO STRIKE

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.451
BETWEEN CITIES THAT HAVE THOSE

02:13:12.517 --> 02:13:14.186
THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS.

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:14.720
THAT ENCOURAGE AFFORDABLE

02:13:14.786 --> 02:13:16.888
HOUSING AND THEN ALSO ALLOWING

02:13:16.955 --> 02:13:18.490
SIT AT FOLKS WHO LIVE IN MORE

02:13:18.557 --> 02:13:20.158
BAD ACTORS CITIES THAT WOULD

02:13:20.225 --> 02:13:22.361
HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL ISSUES.

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:23.628
AS AGAIN JUST WANTED THINK

02:13:25.263 --> 02:13:25.697
REALLY IMPORTANT HOUSING

02:13:25.764 --> 02:13:27.332
STRATEGY AND LOOK FORWARD TO

02:13:27.399 --> 02:13:29.267
WORKING WITH THAT THAT SIMPLY --

02:13:29.334 --> 02:13:32.604
GOING FORWARD.

LENDING WHEN YOU GO FROM A

SINGLE FAMILY TO WHAT OFTENTIMES

02:13:54.459 --> 02:13:56.027
THE BANKS CONSIDER A MULTI UNIT

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:57.496
BUILDING.

02:13:57.562 --> 02:13:58.830

A HIGHER RATE OF FINANCING WHICH

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:07.239
ON THE FACE OF IT MAKES NO SENSE

02:14:07.305 --> 02:14:08.373
