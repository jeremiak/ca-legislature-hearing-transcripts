NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHERE BEFORE I

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:32.930
WAS BORN CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:34.732
MIGHT THINK.

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:37.301
AN ESTIMATED EIGHT HUNDRED

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.569
THOUSAND ILLEGAL ABORTIONS WERE

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:40.671
PERFORMED ANNUALLY.

00:35:40.738 --> 00:35:43.341
RESULTING IN BETWEEN EIGHT

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:45.843
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.145
WOMEN'S DEATHS A YEAR.

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:50.214
THESE WERE WOMEN WHO WERE OUR

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:53.417
DAUGHTERS OR SISTERS OR MOTHERS.

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:54.685
THESE ARE WOMEN WHO WERE SO

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:56.954
DESPERATE NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER

00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:58.990
MOUTH TO FEED MANY OF THEM COULD

00:35:59.056 --> 00:36:00.291
NOT FEED THE MILES THAT THEY HAD

00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:01.993
ALREADY.

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:03.427
THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO GO

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:05.897
THROUGH WHAT WAS THEN A LIFE

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:07.031
THREATENING PROCEDURE

00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:07.331
[inaudible]

00:36:07.398 --> 00:36:09.066
NOW.

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:10.668
THOSE WHO DIDN'T I BY THE WAY

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:12.803
MANY WERE RENDERED STERILE BY

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.071
BOTCHED PROCEDURES SO THEY

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:15.606
COULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN.

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.909
EVEN WHEN AND IF AND WITH WHOM

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:19.443
THEY WANTED [inaudible]

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.113
TODAY ABORTION IS THE MOST

00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:24.248
COMMON OUTPATIENT SURGICAL

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:26.717
PROCEDURE IT IS EIGHT TO TEN

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:28.052
TIMES SAFER.

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:30.187
THAN GIVING BIRTH.

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:32.256
BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE IT LEGAL.

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:33.724
BECAUSE WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:36.093
THE DECISION WHETHER TO HAVE A

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.496
CHILD SHOULD BELONG TO THE WOMAN

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:41.532
ALONE OR IN CONSULTATION WITH

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:42.567
WHOM EVER.

00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:44.902
SHE SO CHOOSES.

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:47.138
THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE.

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:49.240
I REMEMBER BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:50.675
THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE REPUBLICAN

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:52.743
PARTY.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.478
WAS LESS GOVERNMENT IS BETTER

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.781
GOVERNMENT.

00:36:56.847 --> 00:36:58.082
TODAY.

00:36:58.149 --> 00:37:00.318
THERE IS A POLICY THAT SUGGESTS

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:02.753
THAT WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.688
MAKE.

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:05.756
THOSE MOST PERSONAL DECISIONS

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:08.926
WITHOUT GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE.

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:12.196
I FIND THAT TO BE A A DISSONANCE

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:15.132
THAT IS VERY HARD. TO OF

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:17.535
OVERCOME.

00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:19.403
TODAY ONE IN FOUR AMERICAN WOMEN

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.738
WILL HAVE AN ABORTION IN HER

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:22.506
LIFETIME.

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:24.342
I SUGGESTED PART OF THAT IS

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:26.310
BECAUSE WE DON'T MAKE.

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:29.146
RE OF BIRTH CONTROL ACCESSIBLE

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:30.848
THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.216
IMPROVE.

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:34.318
THE RELIABILITY OF BIRTH CONTROL

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:36.387
IN THE COURSE OF DECADES.

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:38.122
OF I DON'T KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:40.091
WHO ARE EXCITED WHEN THEY FIND

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:41.926
THEMSELVES WITHIN UNPLANNED

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:43.661
UNWANTED PREGNANCY.

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:45.796
BUT IT IS THE CHOICE OF WOMEN TO

00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.365
MAKE.

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:50.901
AND IN.

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:52.003
NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WHEN THE

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.938
SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT THE

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:57.008
RIGHT. TO DECIDE INTO CHOOSE WAS

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:58.909
A RIGHT OF PRIVACY THE BELONG TO

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.878
EVERY WOMAN.

00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:03.681
WE SAW WOMEN'S OPPORTUNITIES

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:05.883
INCREASE.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.385
WOMEN WERE ABLE TO MAKE

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:10.488
DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE.

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:11.489
THEY WERE ABLE TO ACT

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:14.058
INDEPENDENTLY THEY WERE ABLE TO

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:16.694
PURSUE THEIR DREAMS AND I SHOULD

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.529
JUST SAY THEY ARE SHOULD SAY.

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:20.498
PROBABLY EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:22.533
EVERY FEMALE IN THIS ROOM.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.769
IT'S A CHOICE.

00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:27.571
IF YOU DON'T WANT.

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:29.540
THE TERMINATE A PREGNANCY.

00:38:29.607 --> 00:38:30.341
AFTER.

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.376
NO ONE'S MAKING IT BUT NOBODY

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:34.011
SHOULD BE FORCED TO CONTINUE A

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:36.313
PREGNANCY THAT IS ON WANTED AND

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.782
SO ON THIS FORTY SIXTH

00:38:37.848 --> 00:38:39.650
ANNIVERSARY.

00:38:39.717 --> 00:38:41.652
IT REMAINS IMPERATIVE THE PRO

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:44.021
CHOICE AMERICANS SEND A MESSAGE

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:45.690
TO CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:48.192
THAT WE WILL NOT GO BACK TO THE

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.694
DAYS OF ILLEGAL ABORTION.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.130
WHEN WOMEN WERE DYING OF SEPSIS?

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:55.433
WHEN CHILDREN WERE NOT LOVED AND

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.168
CARED FOR BECAUSE THEY WERE ON

00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:58.636
WANTED?
