WE GO FORWARD AND WE'RE HOPING

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:44.283

OPPOSITION AT AT THE MOMENT --

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:55.594
THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE --

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:57.496
LOCAL MANDATES THAT THAT ARE

00:19:57.563 --> 00:20:00.365
FUNDED AND THAT IS THE INTENTION --

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:01.934
WEEK WE KNOW THAT THAT BUT SOME

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.701
OF THE HISTORY HAS BEEN WAS

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:04.403
SUSPENDED MANDATES AND THAT IS

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:06.104
NOT WHAT WE WERE SEEKING TO DO

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:08.106
WE'RE STICKING AFFAIR DEMOCRACY --

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:10.042

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:24.856
ALL RIGHT [inaudible]

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:28.760
HERTZBERG.

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.429
PART OF THIS LAW.

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:32.397
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO ENGAGE

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:37.436
IN REDISTRICTING EVERY TEN YEARS.

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:38.437
YES.

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:39.438
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:42.808
STATES REQUIRE THAT THEY RE DRAW

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:45.277
THE LINES EVERY TEN YEARS

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:45.577
[inaudible]

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:49.448
YES [inaudible]

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:52.084
YOU'RE WALKING.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.651
DOES THE YOUR QUESTION AIDED

00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:53.318
WITH THAT.

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:54.319
YES THERE ARE HAVE TO DRAW MAPS

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:54.920
YES DO THEY HAVE TO BE

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:58.657
CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE YES.

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:00.092
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.760
I SPENT YEARS WORKING ON THE

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:04.329
STUFF YOU KNOW MISTER BONTA IT

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:05.931
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:08.133
I THINK THE ARGUMENT IT'S LIKE

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.501
TO ASK A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:10.869
THEY GOT TO COUNT VOTES AND

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:11.603
SAYING WELL THAT'S A LOCAL

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.371
MANDATE.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.239
IT'S THE CONSTITUTION AND IS THE

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:16.341
BASIS OF GOVERNMENT AND ALL

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:17.643
YOU'RE DOING NOW IS MAKING A

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.678
DETERMINATION AND TAKING OUT OF

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:20.779
THE HANDS OF THE ELECTED

00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:22.948
POLITICIANS.

00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:26.485
WHO ARMED RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY ARE

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:28.353
OFTEN JUDGE IN A WAY OF SELF

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.389
DEALING AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:32.157
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.392
WE'VE HAD THESE COMMISSIONS AND

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:34.793
WE'VE LOOKED AT THE LAWS OF THE

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.395
LAST FIFTY YEARS OF THE SUPREME

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.396
COURT CASES?

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:38.664
THE MANDATED ALL OF THE

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.098
CONTIGUOUS NATURES AND

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:41.433
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST AND ALL

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.501
THE LAWS.

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:43.735
THAT THIS ISN'T REALLY THAT MUCH

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:45.103
DIFFERENT AND THAT ALL IT'S

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.672
DOING IS CHANGING A PROCESS THAT

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:48.774
WOULD EXIST IN ANY OF IT AND

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.307
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:50.175
THEY'RE GONNA DRAW.

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:51.476
AND THEN I THINK THE ARGUMENTS

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:53.845
ABOUT COSTS ARE DISINGENUOUS AND

00:21:53.912 --> 00:21:54.780
THAT THEY BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:55.947
COSTS THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO

00:21:56.014 --> 00:21:57.082
MAPS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.784
EVERYTHING ELSE THE QUESTION IS.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.018
WHO DOES IT?

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.687
AND IS IT ARE YOU SAYING THAT

00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:03.188
YOU GOT TO DO OUT REACH AND TALK

00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:04.523
TO THE FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY IN

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:05.791
ORDER TO GET INPUT.

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:07.159
IS THAT SOMETHING WHERE THE

00:22:07.225 --> 00:22:08.960
GOVERNMENT IS MAKING A MANDATE

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:10.262
THAT SOUND REASONABLE AND

00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:11.596
CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:12.998
WE'RE JUST TELLING PEOPLE YOU

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.466
GOT TO DO YOUR JOB THAT YOU

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:16.101
CAN'T DO IT IN THE BACK ROOM

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:16.702
THAT YOU GOT TO CHANGE UP THE

00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:17.703
GAME.

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:19.204
AND SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:20.672
THIS WORK IN A PRETTY BRILLIANT

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:21.707
WAY.

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:23.141
THE ARGUMENTS THAT YOU KNOW

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:24.676
PARTISANSHIP BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:25.377
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AREN'T

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:26.945
PARTISAN BUT IF YOU LOOK AT ALL

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.747
THE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL CASES

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:30.082
THAT HAVE BEEN LITERALLY FIFTY

00:22:30.148 --> 00:22:31.817
YEARS SINCE THE VOTING RIGHTS

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:33.652
ACT IN. NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:35.454
SEVEN FORM THIS PROCESS I DON'T

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.988
BELIEVE YOU DO A THING THAT'S

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.190
ADVERSE TO WILL THIS OR IMPOSING

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:39.491
ANY OBLIGATION.

00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:40.659
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.260
ARGUMENTS ABOUT THIS WILL AFFECT

00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:43.862
THEIR PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IS

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:47.232
THEIR ARGUMENT IT'S ABOUT POWER.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.433
AND SIMPLE AND THIS IS A GREAT

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.469

STRONG DEMOCRACY.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.288

THANK YOU.

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:08.747
IN TERMS OF OF THIS BILL THIS

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:10.382
BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY

00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:12.751
JURISDICTION TO FOR EXAMPLE HAVE

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:14.786

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:16.321
THAT'S CORRECT AND THE ARE YOU

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:18.156
CONCERNED THAT THIS MAY BE A

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.825
DISINCENTIVE FOR LOCAL

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:22.828

ON THE ROAD.

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:31.536
SENDER I'D I DON'T THINK THIS

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:32.304
BILL WILL BEAR ONE WAY OR

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.905

MINORITY REPRESENTATION AND IT

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:42.681

THE PROCEDURES FOR DRAWING THE

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:46.384

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:33.877
OPPOSE

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:34.778
BECAUSE IT WOULD CREATE AN

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:36.279
UNNECESSARY LIMIT ON THE

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:37.581

AB FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE IMPOSES A

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.924
FINE AND THREATENS CRIMINAL

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:49.225

SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY AN

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.263
INITIATIVE WE THINK THIS GOES

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.164
TOO FAR.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:55.098
WELL THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.733
THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.601
ADDRESS THE PERCEPTION OF

00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:59.002
SIGNATURE GATHERING ISSUES THIS

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.804
PERCEPTION IS NOT SUPPORTED BY

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:01.938
THE DATA FROM THE STATE'S

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:02.906

JUST TASK WITH VIGOROUSLY

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:06.776
PROTECTING INITIATIVE PROCESS.

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:07.677
THE BILL ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:09.079
SYSTEM CAN BE SKEWED BY WELL

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:10.513
FUNDED INDIVIDUALS OVER THERE

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.248
ARE MANY WILL FUND A NOT FOR

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:13.283
PROFIT COMPANIES AS WELL.

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:14.551
PROHIBITING HOW THESE PARTIES

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:16.086
PAY THE PARTIES THEY HIRE TO

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.754
DESCRIBE THE ISSUE TO THE PUBLIC.

DOES NOT ADDRESS THIS ISSUE

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:19.990
BECAUSE THERE'S NO COMPELLING

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:21.091
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE PAYING

00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:22.659
ON A PERSONAL BASIS SHOULD BE

00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:23.994
CONSIDERED A CRIME UNDER THE LAW

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.497
CAL CHAMBER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:32.502
THIS.

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:33.203
I PRINT LAYING A CALIFORNIA

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:33.803
QUEEN MONEY CAMPAIGN I DON'T

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HONOR.

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.975
ON BILLS BUT I THINK THIS IS AN

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:40.110
ISSUE THAT.

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:42.212
IS ACROSS THE AISLE THECONCERNS

00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:44.314
THAT WE HAVE WE VERY MUCH AGREE

00:54:44.381 --> 00:54:46.683
WITH THE THE NEED AND CONCERN TO

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:47.984
LIMIT THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.052
SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.286
INITIATIVE PROCESS.

00:54:50.353 --> 00:54:53.123
AND WE'VE WORKED ON THE DISCLOSE

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:53.723
ACT ANOTHER THING OTHER BILLS

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:53.923
WITH.

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.458
MANY MEMBERS A COMMITTEE HERE TO

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:58.028
DO SO -- HOWEVER WE HAVE TWO

00:54:58.094 --> 00:54:59.429
MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:01.331
BILL IN TERMS OF POTENTIALLY

00:55:01.398 --> 00:55:03.600
SHUTTING OUT OF THE PROCESS A

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:05.368
PARTICULARLY GRASSROOTS SORTS OF

00:55:05.435 --> 00:55:07.203
ORGANIZATIONS GOOD GOVERNMENT

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:09.305
ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS THAT.

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:12.842
DON'T HAVE WEALTHY BACKERS -- SO

00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:14.244
ONE ONE PROBLEM IS THE 10%

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.513
THRESHOLD -- WE AS A COVER

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:17.380
COMMITTEE CAMPAIGN IS A

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:20.850
GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION ARE VERY --

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:21.851
SYMPATHETIC TO THE IDEA OF

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:23.853
HAVING TO SHOW SOME SORT OF

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.089
GRASSROOTS SUPPORT -- FOR TO

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:27.691
QUALIFY AN INITIATIVE THAT THE

00:55:27.757 --> 00:55:29.726
PROBLEM IS THAT A 10% THRESHOLD

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:32.362
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE LAST

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.197
ELECTION -- THAT HAD SUCH HIGH

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:37.867
TURNOUT COULD BE -- IMPOSSIBLY

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:39.703
HIGH FOR MANY GRASSROOTS

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:42.172
ORGANIZATIONS -- TO QUALIFY THAT

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:44.074
ARE THAT ARE REALLY RELIANT ON

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.109
VOLUNTEERS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:47.510
AMENDMENT TO BE SET ON THE SAFE

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:49.779
SIDE THAT'S OVER A HUNDRED AND

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:50.580
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SIGNATURES

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:56.720
YOU'D WANT TO HAVE TO GATHER --

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.088
THAT IS.

00:55:58.154 --> 00:55:59.089
NOT THAT MANY GRASSROOTS

00:55:59.155 --> 00:55:59.756
ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOOD

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:00.323
GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.391
GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO DO THAT --

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:03.860
WE PUT IN OUR LETTER THAT THAT --

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:04.694
THOSE CAN'T THE CONCERNS WOULD

00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:05.995
BE ALLAYED IT WAS A LOWER

00:56:06.062 --> 00:56:07.530
THRESHOLD LIKE 5%.

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:10.033
ON THE OTHER PART IN THAT NOT I

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.034
DON'T KNOW THERE IS A WAY TO

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:12.669
RELAY THIS IS THE IDEA OF

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:16.506
BANNING SIGNATURES BY BEING PAID.

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:18.441
TING SIGNATURES BASED OFF OF THE

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:20.543
UPPER SIGNATURE BASIS -- IT IT

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:22.846
SOUNDS APPEALING ON THE SURFACE

00:56:22.912 --> 00:56:25.081
AND I CAN CERTAINLY SEE --

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:26.950
CONCERNS THAT SOME SIGNATURE

00:56:27.016 --> 00:56:28.051
GATHERERS TRYING TO GET AS MANY

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:30.420
SIGNATURES THEY CAN THEY ARE

00:56:30.487 --> 00:56:36.359
ALWAYS THEY DON'T ALWAYS --

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:37.627
FOLLOW THE TRUTH IN DOING SO AND

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:38.795
THAT'S WHY WE ARE WORKING ON

00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:39.662
SPONSORING SB FORTY SEVEN THE

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:40.530
PETITION DISCLOSE ACT TO MAKE

00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:41.798
SURE AT LEAST THEY HAVE TO SHOW

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.266
WHO'S WHO'S PAYING FOR THEM.

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:46.536
BUT THE THE FACT OF THE MATTER

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:48.505
IS IT'S GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY

00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:52.108
INCREASE THE COST.

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:54.511
THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE JUST A

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:55.979
COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.680
NOT PASSED THE BILL THAT

00:56:57.747 --> 00:57:00.183
TRANSPARENTLY WAS ABOUT LIMITING

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.118
THE INITIATIVE PROCESS.

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:04.254
THE SARATOGA'S AT TIMES HEADLINE

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.556
ON THAT WAS FLORIDA LAWMAKERS

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:08.691
PLACE BARRIERS TO BALLOT

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:09.959
INITIATIVES THAT WAS THE

00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:11.461
HEADLINE OF THAT THERE WAS VERY

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:13.196
TRANSPARENT ABOUT STOPPING.

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:14.364
SLOWING DOWN THE NISHA PROCESS

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.466
AND A KEY PART OF THAT BILL THAT

00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:17.667
THEY UNFORTUNATELY PASSED IN THE

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:19.369
GOVERNOR SIGNED.

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:21.771
WAS TO BAN PAYMENT OF SIGNATURES

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:24.274
ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS BECAUSE

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:24.908
OF THE FACT THAT IT COULD RAISE

00:57:24.974 --> 00:57:26.409
COST.

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:27.677
ESTIMATES UP TO TWICE AS HIGH.

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:31.447
NOW IF YOU'RE A A WEALTHY

00:57:31.514 --> 00:57:33.516

BILLION HERE.

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:38.288
A COUPLE EXTRA MILLION BUCKS IS

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:39.489
JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:41.457
THEY'RE GONNA PUBLIC SPEND A LOT

00:57:41.524 --> 00:57:42.859
MORE ON THAT AND THE SIGNATURE

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:43.193
COUNTY PACE.

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:44.127
BUT IF YOU'RE A GRASSROOTS

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:46.029

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:48.364
THAT MAY BE THE DIFFERENCE

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:49.432
BETWEEN YOUR INITIATIVE.

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:51.401
BEING ABLE TO QUALIFY AND NOT SO

00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:52.969
THAT'S WHY WE ARE STRONGLY

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:55.271

I REALLY DRIVE IN EQUITY THE

DEMOCRATIC PROCESS PAYING HOURLY.

00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:21.564
TENDS TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE AND

00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:22.999
MUCH LESS EFFICIENT AS AN

00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:23.967

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:25.802
BY CRIMINALIZING CONDUCT THAT'S

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.570
ASSOCIATED WITH SPEECH IN WITH

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:29.072
DIRECT DEMOCRACY THIS BILL

00:58:29.138 --> 00:58:31.007

FRAUD DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.314
REALLY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM.

00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:40.049
THE IDEA OF 10% OF SIGNATURES

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:41.885
COMING FROM ON PAID CIRCULATORS

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:43.386

WHO CARE ABOUT THE ROLE OF AN

00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:48.625
ISSUE MAYBE LAUDABLE IN THEORY?

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:49.692
BUT THERE ARE MANY LEGITIMATE

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:51.327

THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

THIS BILL COULD SIGNIFICANTLY BE

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:03.706
WORSE THAN THE ABUSES AT THE

EVERYBODY ELSE YOU WOULD AGREE

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:41.477

AND FIND THE VERY BEST PLACES AT

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.454
CENTER THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.389
WHY IN A PAYMENT PER HOUR JUST

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:55.391

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:56.859

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.794
INTERESTS THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:04:58.861 --> 01:05:00.196
A PROBLEM BECAUSE I'LL JUST PAY

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:01.631
THE EXTRA TWO MILLION THEIR

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:02.498
PUBLIC WITH A LOT MORE FOR AN

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:03.065
INITIATIVE.

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.834
BUT IF IT'S A A GOOD GOVERNMENT

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.168
INITIATIVE IF IT'S A GRASS

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:08.337
ANOTHER KIND OF GRASSROOTS

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.872
INITIATIVE -- IT'S IT IT COULD

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:10.640
BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:12.908
QUALIFYING AND NOT WHICH IS WHY

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:13.943
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO US.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.311
SO I WOULD JUST SAY FROM MY

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:16.746
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- I WAS IN

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.114
THE LABOR MOVEMENT FOR TWENTY

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.215
YEARS AND WE DID A LOT OF

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.284
SIGNATURE GATHERING AND I HAVE

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:28.090
SEEN THE THESE.

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:29.458
THE SYSTEM JUST CHANGED

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:30.293
DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS THE

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:31.427
HIGHER THE PRICE IS ON THE

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:32.795
PERSON MITCHELL -- JUST

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:33.629
ANECDOTALLY WHATEVER I HAVE

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:35.431
FOUND IS THE MORE PEOPLE LIE --

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:36.966
AND YOU CAN ASK MY FAMILY AGAIN

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:38.434
THIS IS ANECDOTAL BUT I AM THAT

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.136
PERSON WHEN I'M WALKING INTO A

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:41.604
GROCERY STORE WALKING INTO

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.072
TARGET THAT'S GOING TO ASK THE

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.407
SIGNATURE GET AND I DON'T SIGN

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:46.309
ANYTHING ANYMORE BECAUSE I DON'T

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:47.610
TRUST MOST OF THEM.

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.879
SO MY CONCERN IS IF WE DON'T

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:51.013
CHANGE THE SYSTEM.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.715
WE IT'S JUST GETTING WORSE AND

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.216
WORSE YOU KNOW SO MY QUESTION

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:55.751
ALWAYS IS TO THE SIGNATURE

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:56.819
GATHERER.

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.120
HOW MUCH YOU BEING PAID DO YOU

01:05:58.187 --> 01:05:59.355
ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.857
PEOPLE TO DO 99% OF THE TIME

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:02.992
THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THEY'RE

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.493
DOING AND THEY WILL EVEN SAY TO

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.127
ME?

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:06.329
YOU KNOW -- I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:07.563
MAKE SOME MONEY HERE LADY COULD

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.665
YOU JUST SIGN IT AND I'M LIKE NO

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.300
I WANT YOU TO MAKE MONEY BUT SO

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.035
I'M WORRIED THAT THE THAT TH

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.970
THE WAY WE PUT THINGS ON THE

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:17.540
BALLOT -- AND PROPOSITIONS HAS

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:20.242
REALLY COME BECOME VERY POLLUTED

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.378
AND THE THE 10% SIGNATURE

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:23.412
GATHERING.

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:24.513
I MEAN I'M INTERESTED IN THAT

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.715
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS WITH THE

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:27.016
LABOR MOVEMENT THIS IS SOMETHING

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:29.018
THAT WE TOYED WITH AND AND HOW

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:30.319
DO WE I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:31.454
VOLUNTEER.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.955
COMMUNITIES ARE VOLUNTEER

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.623
ORGANIZATIONS AND NON PROFITS

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:35.791
MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:39.061
HARD TIME WITH THAT.

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.663
I GET THAT.

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:41.197
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THE

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:42.031
CORPORATIONS OR WHATEVER THEY

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:44.233
HAVE TO FIND VOLUNTEERS AS WELL

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.001
AND THEY'RE NOT GOOD AT FINDING

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:47.236
VOLUNTEERS THEY'RE GONNA PAYING

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:47.937
PEOPLE.

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:50.473
SO THEY HAVE TO FIND 10% OF THE

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:52.775
SIGNATURES THE VOLUNTEERS ARE

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.043
PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW COME FROM

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.544
THE COMMUNITY OR WHATNOT.

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:56.345
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY KNOW HOW

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:57.747
TO DO THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.081
WRITE CHECKS.

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:02.284
SO I I APPRECIATE THE THE

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.086
CONCERN BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:06.489
IS THIS IS A HARD SITUATION --

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:08.758
AND I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR YOU

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.459
KNOW IF THERE'S SOME WAY YOU

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:11.794
GUYS CAN WORK OUT ANY.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:12.828
UNDERSTATES NOT GONNA WORK OUT

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:13.929
ANYTHING WITH THE LEAGUE OF

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:16.432
WOMEN VOTERS WHICH WE LOVE YOU

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:17.767
GUYS THANK YOU FOR WAITING.

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:18.367
WE'VE JUST MIGHT NOT AGREE ON

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:19.702
THIS BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.137
YOU GUYS CAN WORK OUT YOU KNOW I

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:22.638
LIKE TO JOKE AND SAY THAT IF

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:23.839
EVERYBODY WALKS AWAY A LITTLE

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:25.708
HAPPY IN A LITTLE UNHAPPY WE'VE

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.042
REACHED A GOOD NEGOTIATION.

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.977
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:29.412
TODAY BECAUSE I DO THINK THE

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.847
SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND WE NEED TO

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:33.749
DO SOMETHING TO RAIN SOME OF

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:34.316
THESE THESE CAUGHT.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.785
I AND I WORRY ABOUT THE COST BUT

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:37.153
WE NEED TO RAINY AND WHAT

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.687
CORPORATE AMERICA CAN DO AND I

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:43.659
THINK BY HAVING SOME SORT OF

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.828
VOLUNTEER PROCESS.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.396
CHANGES THAT -- WHETHER OR NOT

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:49.999
WE CHANGE IT TO FIVE OR 10% --

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:50.633
I'LL LEAVE THAT TO BOTH OF YOU

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:51.467
BUT I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:52.601
OF ISSUE THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:53.903
THE BILL CONTINUE TO MOVE

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:54.136
FORWARD.

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:56.005
THANK YOU.

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:59.909
THANK YOU SIR OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:03.379
AND TO THE OPPONENTS A COUPLE

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:04.680
OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:05.981
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:08.350
ESTIMATED INCREASING COSTS AND

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:09.952
ALL OF US ARE PRODUCTS OF OUR

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:10.986
OWN EXPERIENCE.

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:12.588
THE THREE OF US UP HERE OF ALL

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.390
RUN FOR ELECTION BEEN INVOLVED

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:15.391

I'M IN AND HOW DO YOU ARRIVE AT

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:18.694
THE CONCLUSION VERY IMPAIR DATA

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.629
THAT SAYS IF YOU PAY FOLKS BY

01:08:20.696 --> 01:08:23.599
THE HOUR IT WILL INCREASE COSTS.

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:25.401
OF TIMES.

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:26.168
TO I'M.

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:28.070
I'M NOT AWARE OF EMPIRICAL DATA

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:28.904
MAYBE.

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.240
MAYBE THE THE CHAMBER IS -- BUT

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:33.676
I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:35.110
QUITE NATURAL WE WE AT HIGHER

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:37.546
ORGANIZER'S AND AND WHEN YOU YOU

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.282
NATURALLY GIVE ORGANIZER'S -- IN

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:42.017
SIGNATURE GATHERERS INCENTIVES

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.619
TO GIVE THEM INCENTIVES HEY YOU

GIVE YOU A FREE TRIP TO

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:49.258
STARBUCKS RIGHT DID JUST THAT

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:51.193
SORT OF INCENTIVE MAKES A A BIG

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.964
DIFFERENCE -- SO IT -- WE'VE

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:57.299
TALKED -- TO OTHER FOLKS HAVE

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:58.467
BEEN ENGAGED IN SIGNATURE

01:08:58.534 --> 01:09:00.336
GATHERING PROCESS.

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:00.936
THAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS AT HIGHS

01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:02.037
DOUBLE IT COULD BE I'VE HEARD

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:04.073
ESTIMATES AS LOW AS 20% OF AN

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:06.842
INCREASE BUT EVEN A 20% INCREASE

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:09.812
ON A PROCESS THAT MAY COST TWO

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:10.613
THREE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:11.113
ALREADY.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.682
IF AGAIN IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:24.293
THE WEALTHY -- INITIATIVE.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.495
FUNDERS THEY CAN JUST PAY THAT

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:27.630
EXTRA COST I MEAN IT IS A LITTLE

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:28.264
BIT OF A IT'S DEFINITELY PROBLEM

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:29.565
BUT THEY'LL STILL BE ABLE TO

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:30.566
QUALIFY THEIR INITIATIVES WHAT'S

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:31.333
GONNA HAVE THE PROBLEMS.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.001
EVEN AN EXTRA 20% THAT MEANS AN

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:32.701
EXTRA FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:33.602
EXTRA MILLION DOLLARS IT HAS TO

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:34.603
BE PAID. FOR A GRASSROOTS

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.438
INITIATIVE FOR A GOOD GOVERNMENT

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:37.339
INITIATIVE WHICH TYPICALLY IS

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:40.276
NOT BACKED BY WEALTHY FUNDERS.

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:42.711
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT.

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:44.713
PROBLEM TO INITIAL PROCESS

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:45.748
BECAUSE IT'S MEANT TO IS MEANT

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.783
TO ALLOW GRASSROOTS THE VOTERS

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.286
TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY.

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.120
AS AN OPTION.

01:09:51.186 --> 01:09:52.288
ANY I MEAN I THINK THAT LORNE

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.156
EXAM WILL BE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:55.157
EMPIRICAL DATA TO DATE AND THAT

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:55.958
DOES SUGGEST THAT THERE'S

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.026
ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT COST ME

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.193
THE ISSUE FOR BUSINESSES

01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.995
OBVIOUSLY IS OUR EMPLOYEES ARE

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:02.197
VERY ENGAGED AND INTERESTED IN

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:03.866
THESE TYPES OF ISSUES.

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:04.533
BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.135
ALWAYS HAVE TIME WE DON'T HAVE A

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:08.137
LARGE VOLUNTEER BASE TO MOBILIZE

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:09.038
WHEN THESE ISSUES COME UP

01:10:09.104 --> 01:10:09.638
THROUGH TALKING ABOUT PAYING

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:11.740
THEM. TO DO THEIR WORK AND THEN

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:13.542
PAYING THEM AFTER THE FACT ON A

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:14.543
TO GIVE THEM AN INCENTIVE TO GO

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:16.111
DOOR TO DOOR AND BE MORE

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:18.080
EFFICIENT WITH THEIR TIMES

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:19.315
THAT'S WHERE THE COST INCREASES

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.583
COMMON.

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:21.817
IN MENTION FLOWS THEIR DATA FROM

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.285
FLORIDA THAT INDICATES THAT THE

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:24.587
COSTS OR IS IT BETTER THEIR

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:25.688
ESTIMATE I BELIEVE THERE IS AND

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:27.856
I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:33.128
PROVIDES YOU AFTER THE FACT THAT

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:36.899
WOULD BE USEFUL -- OKAY IN IN IS

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:37.700
AN EARLY VOTE ILLUSTRATES IS

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:38.467
THAT WE ARE ALL PRODUCT OF OUR

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:39.401
OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.337
SINCE ALL OF US UP HERE HAVE

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:41.971
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN ELECTIONS

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:42.271
[inaudible]

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:43.672
HISTORICALLY.

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:44.106
FOLKS WOULD DO VOTER

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:45.107
REGISTRATION BY SIGNATURE BY

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:45.874
VOTER REGISTRATION CARD.

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:48.677
AND THEN AT LEAST -- I THINK ON

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.479
THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE ALLEGED IT'S

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:52.715
GONE THE HOURLY. TO INCREASE

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:55.918
BASICALLY THE QUALITY -- AND SO

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.386
OUR OWN EXPERIENCE LEASE MY OWN

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:58.587
EXPERIENCES WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:00.623
YOU'RE INCREASING THE QUALITY OF

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:04.026
THE REGISTRATION -- UP I'LL PUT

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.494
THAT OUT THERE AND OTHERS CAN

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.196
DISAGREE IN THE SECOND.

01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:08.464
OBSERVATION IS IN THIS IS

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.066
OBSERVATION FROM ELECTION --

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:13.302
ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO IT -- I I

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:15.571
OBSERVE FOLKS REPRESENTING THE

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:18.874
RECALL PETITION WAS A REPEAL OF

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:23.112
THE GAS TAX AND THE AT THE END

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:23.746
THAT.

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.347
WAS IT WAS CLEARLY A FALSEHOOD

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:26.415
AND I THINK.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.183
PEOPLE ARE INCENTIVIZED TO TO

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.785
LIMIT THE GAS TAX SIGN THE

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.654
PETITION THINKING THEY WERE.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.254
SIGNED A PETITION DILEMMA THE

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:34.890
GAS TAX AS OPPOSED TO RECALL SO

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.860
I THOSE THOSE THOSE EXPERIENCES --

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:39.795
INFLUENCE MY JUDGMENT HAVING

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:42.564
SAID THAT THOUGH IS THAT I AFTER

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:43.666
MEETING WITH FOLKS I AM

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:45.000
CONCERNED ABOUT THE 10%

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:47.569
THRESHOLD I AM INTERESTED IN.

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:50.072
REDUCING IT 25% I REALIZE THAT

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:52.708
WE CAN'T DO THAT TODAY BUT I'D

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.877
ASK THE AUTHOR WILL WELL IF THEY

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:55.444
WOULD CONSIDER IF HE WOULD

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:56.245
CONSIDER.

01:11:56.311 --> 01:12:04.586

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.030
ON HOW THE PAY STRUCTURE WORKS

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:24.066
AND WE ALSO KNOW FROM THOSE OF

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:25.200
US WHO'VE BEEN EXPERIENCE THAT

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.702
THESE FOLKS THAT DO THIS STUFF

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:27.503
TRAVEL FROM ALL AROUND THE

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:28.103
COUNTRY.

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:29.238
AND THEY JUST BUILT UP THE

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:30.272
NUMBER AND WITH THE HIGHEST

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.974
NUMBER IS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.442
ISSUE DOESN'T MATTER.

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:34.610
THEY MAKE DECENT MONEY IN THERE

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:35.644
THEY KIND OF THAT'S WHAT THEY DO

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:37.913
AND SO WE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.015
WITH THIS FOR DECADES FIGURING

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:43.585
OUT HOW DO YOU BALANCE OUT ON

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:44.887
THE ONE HAND.

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:45.954
THE THE UNDERLYING NATURE OF

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:47.089
THIS PROCESS WHICH IS.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:49.091
CRITICALLY APPROPRIATE IMPORTANT

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:51.260
WITH WHAT'S TRANSPIRED BECAUSE

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:53.195
WHEN YOU LOOK AT JUST I

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:54.830
APOLOGIZE IF IS ALREADY SAID I'M

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:55.931
SORRY JUST VOTING IN ANOTHER

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:56.198
COMMITTEE.

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:59.234
BUT WHAT HIRAM JOHNSON CAME UP

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:01.470
WITH THIS THIS RUBBER FORM ALL

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:02.638
IT WAS ALL ABOUT GETTING RID OF

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:04.740
POWER IN SACRAMENTO WHEN IN FACT

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:07.242
NOW WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IS OF

01:14:07.309 --> 01:14:08.343
FOLKS THAT HAVE MONEY.

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:09.478
THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:12.815
OVERTURN THE POWER THE COMMUNITY

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:13.816
THE LAST TIME I REMEMBER THAT

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:17.085
WAS ALMOST A COMPLETE -- CITIZEN

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:19.054
DRIVEN -- VOLUNTEER DRIVEN

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.823
ENDEAVOR WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:22.558
EIGHT WITH PROP THIRTEEN I DON'T

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:24.426
REMEMBER ANYTHING SINCE THEN.

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:25.794
THAT HAS BEEN REALLY DRIVEN BY

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:28.497
FOLKS VERSES INTEREST GROUPS ON

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:29.598
WHATEVER SIDE OF THE THE TRADE

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:30.432
THERE IS.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:33.302
WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS IS 5% AS

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:35.103
THE CHAIRMAN HAS SAID.

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:36.972
IN THE PAST FOR COSTS OF THE

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.740
REASONS YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.175
THESE FIGHTS THAT WE KEEP

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.176
ENGAGING IN AND SOME YOU KNOW

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:43.779
TOOK FORTY FIVE TIMES FOR THE

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:45.247
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT PASSED THE

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.982
UNITED STATES CONGRESS SO.

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:48.250
I THINK THE THE FACT THAT

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.819
IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:51.820
TAKE A LONG TIME ISN'T THE

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:55.824
DECEIT REASON WHY YOU DON'T KEEP

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:56.758
UP THE FIGHT.

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:57.759
BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT FOR THE

01:14:57.826 --> 01:14:59.127
REASONS IF HE HAS NOT

01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:00.662
ARTICULATED THAT WERE TO GO TO

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:01.463
IN YOUR ANALYSIS.

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.165
THAT 5% AS WE HAVE DONE WITH THE

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:05.033
NEWMAN BILLS IT WITH LENO AND

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.869
WITH CORBETT AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:09.037
PROBABLY MEETS THE NECESSARY

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.739
THRESHOLD -- IN TERMS OF

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:12.374
CREATING A BIG ENOUGH OF AN

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:13.242
ORGANIZATION.

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:14.743
THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:15.677
ONE OF THE ODDITIES IN THE

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:16.945
CIRCUMSTANCES JUST FOR HE

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.247
RECORD IS.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.382
THE DETERMINATION OF HOW MANY

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:21.817
VOTES ON THE SIGNATURE G. IS

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:22.551
DETERMINED BY PREVIOUS

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:23.652
SELECTIONS IF YOU HAD A REAL

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:25.153
HIGH TURNOUT ELECTION ALL OF A

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.688
SUDDEN YOU HAVE A REPORT AN IDEA

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:27.756
YOU WANT TO PUT THE BALLOT.

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.157
IT'S INFORMED BY A MUCH HIGHER

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:30.492
THRESHOLD IN A LOW TURNOUT

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:32.628
ELECTION KIND OF A LITTLE BIT

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.263
IRRATIONAL BUT THE TO THE EXTENT

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:35.964
THAT AT LEAST A 5% NUMBER YOU

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:38.000
CAN GET IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:39.501
HAVE SUPPORTED THIS OVER AND

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.637
OVER AGAIN OVER THE YEARS.

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:43.572
BUT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:45.307
JUST AGAIN I YOU WANNA MAKE ANY

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:45.908

THAT IN FOR THE RECORD.

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.644
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING

APPROPRIATE INTEGRITY.

THE PUBLIC ON THE ONE HAND.

01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:00.756
AND AND IT REALLY IT HERE'S TO

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:02.691
THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE AND

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:04.259
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY THAT IS SO

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:09.298
